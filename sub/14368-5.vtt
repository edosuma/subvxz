00:54.929 --> 00:57.265
{\an8}But I want Ginger
for my team.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.018
{\an8}Come on, guys,
it's just a game.

01:00.101 --> 01:04.355
{\an8}It's <i> my</i> turn to pick
and <i> I</i> pick Ginger.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.815
{\an8}But you hate Ginger.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.649
{\an8}Of course I hate Ginger.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.153
{\an7}But let's face it,
she can volley

01:10.236 --> 01:11.654
{\an8}and since this is volleyball...

01:11.738 --> 01:14.157
{\an8}Miranda, might I remind you

01:14.240 --> 01:17.494
{\an8}that I have a reputation
as a winner to maintain?

01:17.577 --> 01:21.623
{\an7}And when the sea rises,
so do all the little boats.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.124
{\an7}Well, I'm tired
of being a little boat.

01:23.208 --> 01:27.128
{\an8}I don't even know
why we're having
this argument

01:27.212 --> 01:29.422
{\an8}since everyone knows
you're going to cave.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.925
{\an8}I am not.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.843
{\an7}Ooh, all good friendship settle
into a comfortable pattern.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.721
{\an8}It's why ours is so enduring.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.388
{\an8}Enduring?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.182
Let's see if
it endures this.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.768
I'm picking Ginger,
so tough luck.

01:41.851 --> 01:42.685

It's... it's like
the kind I wanted

01:51.611 --> 01:52.904
but I know
I can't have it.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.699
{\an1}Oh, we'd rule fifth grade
if we owned it.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.201
Rule, I tell you!

01:58.284 --> 02:00.245
Quit torturing me, Carl.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.205
The point is, we
can't afford it.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.122
Well, you know what?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.415
We just got to
raise the money.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.125
{\an1}But how?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.558
{\an1}We made it
just in time, madam.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.184
And congratulations.

02:23.268 --> 02:23.893
It looks like

you'll be running unopposed.

Besides myself, that is.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.444
Is that a new tennis outfit,
Claire?

03:14.527 --> 03:18.323
Good for you for finding
the time to play.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.782
Oh, I wish I could.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.200

Homemade oxtail!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.251
Au revoir!

03:31.461 --> 03:33.838
{\an1}Winston...

03:33.922 --> 03:35.131
she called me Claire.

03:35.214 --> 03:39.469
She had no right,
no right at all!

03:39.552 --> 03:42.639
{\an1}And then I heard Mipsy,
Mindy and Missy

03:42.722 --> 03:44.307
all sided with Courtney.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.268
It's that Gripling
gravitational pull.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.812
Looks like Miranda's
out in the cold.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.815
{\an1}I must say, Ginger, you've
been awfully calm about this.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.276
I didn't have anything
to do with their fight.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.320
{\an5}You had everything
to do with it.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.446
They fought over <i> you.</i>

03:58.529 --> 04:00.823
Right. I mean, what if
you're, like, cornered

04:00.907 --> 04:02.659
{\an1}in the Girls' Room
with no way out

04:02.742 --> 04:05.328
{\an1}and they forced you
to take sides?

04:05.912 --> 04:07.622
I've heard it could happen.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.332
Well, I'm not taking
anyone's side.

04:09.415 --> 04:13.836
I'm just going to mind my own
business and eat my lunch.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.838
Ooh! Oh, my gosh, lunch.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.216
Where is Miranda going to sit?

04:18.298 --> 04:20.259
We're about
to find out.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.929
(<i> huffing</i> )

04:37.026 --> 04:38.236
Uh-oh.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.278
{\an3}What?
What?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.030
She's going for
the condiments.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.365
That means
she's...

04:42.448 --> 04:43.449
{\an5}Stalling.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.449
Stalling.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.118
Ginger, you're
missing everything.

04:45.201 --> 04:48.454
And you are missing some
super-swell baked ziti.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.959
Mmm! Yes, you are,
'cause I'm not taking sides.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.961
(<i> laughing</i> )

04:55.044 --> 04:56.337
{\an1}She's run out
of salad dressings.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.965
And it's too early for
the frozen yogurt machine.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
Now she'd have to find
a place to sit.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.135
Where are you going?

05:02.218 --> 05:03.553
I can't take it anymore.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.929
The tension's killing me.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.973
Darren, come back!

05:11.811 --> 05:14.814
It's taken!

05:17.608 --> 05:19.193
(<i> wailing</i> )

05:19.277 --> 05:21.237
So sorry, madam,
but your winning

05:21.320 --> 05:23.740
{\an1}would have been
quite a feather in my cap.

05:23.823 --> 05:28.119
Dry your tears, Winston, because
I have no intention of losing.

05:28.202 --> 05:32.415
{\an1}This spark in your voice--
you have an idea?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.125
Euphrasia Weinstein
is not the only one

05:34.208 --> 05:36.794
who can impress
the Charity Committee

05:36.878 --> 05:38.087
by fattening her résumé.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.925
{\an1}Of course, you will
take up a cause.

05:43.009 --> 05:43.968
{\an1}Which one?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.846
Helping a destitute
individual.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.931
The way your mind works!

05:49.015 --> 05:51.559
CLAIRE:
<i>Now I just need to find one.</i>

05:56.355 --> 05:58.733
(<i> panting</i> )

06:02.028 --> 06:04.739
{\an1}I can't believe we didn't
even think of layaway.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.076
{\an1}It's a good thing Gordon
told that long, boring story

06:08.159 --> 06:10.787
about her porcelain
figurine collection

06:10.870 --> 06:12.538
and its 12 easy payments.

06:12.622 --> 06:13.081
Yeah. Let's see--

06:13.164 --> 06:16.918
if we put down $5 a week

06:17.001 --> 06:20.046
{\an1}the lie detector
will be ours in...

06:20.129 --> 06:20.755
80 weeks!

06:20.838 --> 06:23.549
{\an1}Is it me or is that
a long time?

06:23.633 --> 06:28.054
Hey, Carl, it's a
whole other dollar!

06:31.849 --> 06:33.893
The brakes, madam!

06:33.976 --> 06:35.686
{\an3}The brakes!

06:35.770 --> 06:36.521
(<i> yelling</i> )

06:40.566 --> 06:42.026
Master Carl!

06:42.110 --> 06:42.735
Master Woodsey!

06:42.819 --> 06:44.821
Its Hoodsey.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.907
Oh, you're not one
of the destitute?

06:47.990 --> 06:48.908
Not likely.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.326
We just look that way.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.327
{\an5}It's just that
I've been thinking

06:51.410 --> 06:55.289
{\an5}about Darren's "cornered
in the bathroom" stuff

06:55.373 --> 06:56.916
{\an5}and it's starting
to get to me.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.877
Do you really think Courtney
would do something like that?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.254
Uh-huh. That's what
I'm thinking.

07:01.337 --> 07:05.133
Oh, Ginger, I hope
your inviting Miranda

07:05.216 --> 07:07.093
to sit with you
at lunch today

07:07.176 --> 07:09.011
doesn't mean
you're on her side.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.266
I didn't invite her,
and I'm not on anyone's side.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.767
Ginger!

07:14.851 --> 07:17.270
{\an1}Were those jalapeños
hot or what?

07:17.353 --> 07:19.397
You don't even
<i>like</i> jalapeños.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.523
{\an1}You only <i> thought</i>
I didn't like them.

07:20.606 --> 07:24.152
Look, the whole chair thing
at lunch was not my fault.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.279
See? Ginger
agrees with me.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.365
This fight is all <i> your</i> fault,
Miranda.

07:29.448 --> 07:32.827
Ginger didn't even want
to be on your old team.

07:32.910 --> 07:33.828
W-Wait a minute.

07:33.911 --> 07:34.954
That's not true.

07:35.037 --> 07:35.371
{\an1}It isn't?

07:35.454 --> 07:36.330
I mean, well...

07:36.414 --> 07:39.542
Look, it <i> was</i> Miranda's
turn to choose.

07:39.625 --> 07:45.006
Whoa, Ginger, she's turned you
against me already.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.465
But I forgive you.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.093
Well, Miranda,
it looks like

07:49.177 --> 07:52.388
I'll be scouting
for a new B.F.F.

07:52.471 --> 07:54.015
Hmm, I wonder who it'd be.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.684
I have so many friends
to choose from.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.102
Yeah? Well,
I'm scouting, too

07:58.186 --> 08:02.398
and I've already lined up
a possible candidate: Ginger!

08:02.481 --> 08:02.773
(<i> all gasp</i> )

08:02.857 --> 08:04.650
What?

08:07.486 --> 08:08.905
But you said
yoAnd you believed me?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.073
A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!

08:11.157 --> 08:12.533
I never really hated you.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.035
Just disliked you intensely.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.745
There's a big difference.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.288
There is?

08:17.371 --> 08:18.789
Huge. Besides, this is
all your fault, Ginger.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.625
{\an3}<i>My</i> fault?

08:20.708 --> 08:21.375
{\an1}If you hadn't
stuck up for me

08:21.459 --> 08:23.169
{\an1}I wouldn't be
in this predicament.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.337
{\an1}Now I owe
my loyalty to you

08:24.420 --> 08:27.924
{\an1}and how awful is that
going to be for me?

08:28.007 --> 08:29.258
You're so selfish.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.093
{\an1}So, should we go
to your place after school?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.179
{\an1}They're spraying
for silverfish at mine.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.263
CLAIRE:
<i>Let me see if I have this.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:37.683
One of you will pose
as a poor orphan boy

08:37.767 --> 08:43.940
{\an1}to help me win the election
if I pay you $399.99.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.275
Plus tax
and delivery.

08:46.359 --> 08:46.943
Too much?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.153
(<i> chortling</i> )

08:49.237 --> 08:50.112
Too much?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.782
Ooh, that is rich,
Master Carl.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.950
It's just that...

08:54.033 --> 08:55.284
(<i> chuckles</i> )

08:55.368 --> 08:57.787
{\an1}Well, it sounds
an awful lot like cheating.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.288
Winston, talk to her.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.792
Well, madam, the way
I see it, people cheat

09:02.875 --> 09:05.336
but the Griplings
use cunning.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.963
MACIE:
<i>But I thought you didn't want</i>

09:07.046 --> 09:08.881
to get involved.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.299
I know this is going
to sound crazy

09:10.383 --> 09:11.342
but I kind of feel
sorry for her.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.303
{\an1}We <i> are</i> talking
about Miranda, right?

09:14.387 --> 09:18.349
The only person who can make
the clarinet sound bitter?

09:18.432 --> 09:20.559
Guys, put yourself in her place.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.311
All of a sudden,
she's friendless.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.648
{\an1}I think there's
a reason for that:

09:25.731 --> 09:26.691
No one likes her.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.484
Macie, Ginger's right.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.402
She needs us.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.153
{\an1}We'll be calling
the shots for once.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.365
{\an5}She won't even know
how to function
without Courtney.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.283
She'll be as docile
as a lamb.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.286
...and then the
hall monitor blabbed

09:38.369 --> 09:40.705
and the girl was
<i>so</i> humiliated

09:40.788 --> 09:41.998
she had to
transfer schools!

09:42.081 --> 09:43.833
{\an3}(<i> laughs</i> )

09:43.916 --> 09:46.085
That's not a
very nice story.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.086
{\an3}Oh...

09:47.169 --> 09:49.672
{\an1}What Macie means is,
if you can't say anything nice

09:49.755 --> 09:51.716
you shouldn't say
anything at all.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.510
{\an1}Oh...

09:54.593 --> 09:56.053
Miranda, I think
what they both mean

09:56.137 --> 09:59.181
is that you should try
saying something nice.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.976
But I've never
said anything nice.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.686
Never? In your entire life?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.354
Not even to your
mom and dad?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.648
Do you have a
problem with that?

10:07.732 --> 10:08.733
Uh-uh.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.776
{\an1}I bet you could say
something nice if you tried.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.488
Well...

10:16.907 --> 10:18.701
Your bedroom isn't nearly

10:18.784 --> 10:21.620
as lame as I thought
it would be, Ginger.

10:21.704 --> 10:27.918
Whew! Well, I'm never
doing that again.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.213
Don't you think

10:31.297 --> 10:33.549
"plucked from the gutter"
sounds overly dramatic?

10:33.632 --> 10:37.553
{\an1}I believe the correct term
is "melodramatic."

10:37.636 --> 10:38.179
Everybody is a critic.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.973
I slaved
over those lines.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.100
Yeah, but <i> I</i> got to sell 'em.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.895
And how can I
if I don't feel it <i> here?</i>

10:45.978 --> 10:47.855
Hmm...

10:47.938 --> 10:49.273
{\an1}Perhaps if you didn't
rush the delivery.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.984
And how come I have to
be the poor orphan boy

10:52.068 --> 10:54.403
while you sell yourself
as my "handler"?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.405
I don't even know
what that is.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.074
I'm too robust-looking, Hoods

10:58.157 --> 11:00.284
while you're the picture
of pathetic.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.577
An-And I mean that
as a compliment

11:01.660 --> 11:05.414
{\an5}because that's exactly
what's going to earn
us a lie detector.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.250
Oh, the Committee's here!

11:08.334 --> 11:09.835
Now, how are you at
a tubercular cough?

11:09.919 --> 11:12.755
{\an5}He can phlegm it up
with the best of them,
Claire, trust me.

11:12.838 --> 11:18.761
And I think double-breasted
makes me look portly.

11:19.637 --> 11:19.970
Mom!

11:20.054 --> 11:22.723
Yo-ho, Mom!

11:24.183 --> 11:27.144
{\an5}Ginger?

11:24.183 --> 11:27.144
Hey, Mom.

11:27.228 --> 11:27.728
Oh, hey.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.437
If we don't
all fit

11:28.521 --> 11:31.232
you can always
take the bus.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.151
Hi, Mrs. Foutley.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.027
{\an3}Hi, Dodie.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.153
Hello, Mrs. F.

11:36.237 --> 11:36.904
{\an3}Macie, hi.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.697
Miranda.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.370
I'll explain everything later.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.998
Ging, do you think
you can push your seat up?

11:48.082 --> 11:50.376
I've got long legs,
you know?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.920
(<i> groaning</i> )

11:56.465 --> 11:57.675
(<i> Hoodsey sobbing</i> )

11:57.758 --> 12:02.430
Oh, and there I was
in the gutter with a dollar

12:02.513 --> 12:04.014
clutched in my grimy hand

12:04.098 --> 12:07.601
{\an5}when Mrs. Gripling
plucked me from
my terrible life

12:07.685 --> 12:13.816
{\an5}and decided through
the goodness of her
heart to sponsor me.

12:13.899 --> 12:14.984
{\an1}Oh...

12:15.067 --> 12:17.820
CROWD:
Aw... aw...

12:20.072 --> 12:23.993
We need to pick up trunks
before I show you the pool.

12:24.076 --> 12:24.952
What's it going
to cost me?

12:25.035 --> 12:28.164
Because I'm not poster
swimmer au naturel.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.708
It doesn't cost anything

12:30.791 --> 12:33.836
{\an1}and we don't do anything
here au naturel.

12:33.919 --> 12:39.091
Two towels and a pair of junior
executive swim trunks, please.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.389
{\an3}That's it?

12:45.473 --> 12:46.390
An-And you get to
keep the stuff?

12:46.474 --> 12:49.351
All that's required is
the Gripling signature.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.271
Now, if you'll
follow me.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.691
All you have to do is
sign the Gripling name

12:55.774 --> 12:58.527
and you can get
whatever you want.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.196
It's like having
a credit card

13:00.279 --> 13:02.364
without the hassle
of monthly payments.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.867
But, Carl, you don't
even like terry cloth

13:04.950 --> 13:07.745
{\an1}and you totally missed
my performance.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.038
I rocked!

13:09.121 --> 13:09.747
{\an5}Part of me thinks
that...

13:09.830 --> 13:13.459
WINSTON:
Blimey, gents, it worked!

13:13.542 --> 13:14.460
The mistress
has been elected

13:14.543 --> 13:17.755
President
of the Charity Committee

13:17.838 --> 13:20.174
by an overwhelming majority.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.594
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I've never been so happy.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
(<i> honking</i> )

13:24.762 --> 13:26.639
Now, that's just swell, Winston.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.057
Well, our job here is done.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.060
There's just a small matter
of the... check.

13:31.143 --> 13:31.727
Yes, of course.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.396
Mrs. Gripling
is so pleased

13:34.480 --> 13:37.733
{\an1}she's giving you a bonus:
permanent membership

13:37.816 --> 13:40.402
{\an1}under the auspices
of the Gripling name--

13:40.486 --> 13:44.823
{\an1}her very first act of charity
as Committee President.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.077
Permanent membership?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.161
Hoods, we're in!

13:49.245 --> 13:51.121
Everything's only
a signature away.

13:51.205 --> 13:55.209
I... I don't even
know where to start.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.174
But, Carl, what about...

14:02.258 --> 14:04.760
Compliments of the
Charity Committee.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.347
{\an1}That's like
all we can eat, right?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.854
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

14:15.938 --> 14:18.482
Wha... What?

14:18.566 --> 14:19.608
Uh-huh.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.610
I didn't wake
you up, did I?

14:21.694 --> 14:22.319
Miranda?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.571
Why are you calling?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.240
It's the middle
of the night.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.826
Tell me about it.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.035
I can't sleep.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.580
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

14:32.663 --> 14:33.747
Courtney usually reads to me

14:33.831 --> 14:35.291
from <i> Tropical Fish World</i>
magazine.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.252
You wouldn't happen to have
a copy lying around, would you?

14:38.335 --> 14:40.129
No, I wouldn't.

14:40.212 --> 14:40.713
Oh.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.464
Then why don't you just

14:42.548 --> 14:43.674
tell me about
your hopes and dreams?

14:43.757 --> 14:45.926
<i>That ought to put me out.</i>

14:54.435 --> 14:56.312
Chaps, the new
golf carts are in.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.063
What say we
commandeer a couple

14:58.147 --> 15:00.983
and terrify them
out at the tenth hole?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.234
I got to work on my tan.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.403
And I just put in
a beverage order.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.071
Tan? Beverage order?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.032
Gents, I'm talking golf carts--

15:08.115 --> 15:12.703
moving vehicles that don't
require driver's licenses!

15:12.786 --> 15:14.121
Maybe later.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.497
After our sauna.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.000
Carl? Hoodsey?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.377
Can it really be you?

15:20.461 --> 15:21.837
She called you guys, too?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.840
Yeah, she was reconfirming
an appointment

15:24.923 --> 15:25.799
to go over my colors
next Tuesday.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.427
I'm supposed to be
rethinking them.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.804
I'll be taking notes.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.015
Well, she couldn't sleep.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.516
So she made sure
you couldn't either.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.684
{\an1}What's that
supposed to mean?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.687
Who's running the show
around here?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.939
I am. I mean, we are.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.609
I mean... aren't we?

15:43.692 --> 15:45.527
Hey! What...

15:45.611 --> 15:47.237
Darren?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.407
Miranda, what
are you doing?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.326
You nearly
knocked Darren off.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.495
DARREN:
She did knock me off.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.914
And just why wasn't I told
about this little meeting?

15:56.997 --> 15:59.291
It's a good thing
I'm naturally suspicious

15:59.375 --> 16:01.543
or I would have
completely missed it.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.795
(<i> groaning</i> )

16:02.878 --> 16:03.712
She says she owes me

16:03.796 --> 16:06.215
{\an1}but she's acting
like I owe her

16:06.298 --> 16:08.801
and, okay, maybe I felt
a little sorry for her at first

16:08.884 --> 16:12.971
{\an1}but now she's totally
invaded my life.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.473
Felt sorry for her, huh?

16:14.556 --> 16:15.891
{\an1}I mean, you weren't letting
her hang out with you

16:15.974 --> 16:19.311
'cause you're looking
to boss her around

16:19.395 --> 16:20.562
for a change, are you?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.439
You know, for all those
times she bossed you

16:22.523 --> 16:23.899
and now you're mad 'cause

16:23.982 --> 16:26.026
things haven't worked out
the way <i> you</i> wanted.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.862
No, that's totally...

16:28.946 --> 16:31.865
Dead-on.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.129
(<i> chuckling evilly</i> )

16:50.509 --> 16:51.635
Carl?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.512
{\an1}Mm-hmm?

16:53.595 --> 16:56.056
Were we supposed
to do something?

16:57.433 --> 17:00.269
Uh, can't think of anything.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.271
Me neither.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.605
In fact, it's kind of weird.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.523
I haven't thought about anything
for a while.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.528
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.487
Oh, well.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.406
{\an1}Want to go for a salt rub
when we're done here?

17:12.489 --> 17:16.242
Uh-huh.

17:17.911 --> 17:18.746
Miranda...

17:18.829 --> 17:20.038
I think it's
time that I...

17:20.122 --> 17:21.330
Don't tell me.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.290
I've already heard.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.876
You've already heard what?

17:23.959 --> 17:27.253
That Courtney and Mipsy are
having "B.F.F." bracelets made.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.672
I can't believe it!

17:28.756 --> 17:29.798
They are?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.300
Sterling.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.303
Well, ours will be 14 karat.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.220
<i>Ours?</i>

17:35.304 --> 17:36.263
Well, there's just no way

17:36.346 --> 17:38.140
{\an1}I'm going through
the rest of junior high

17:38.223 --> 17:38.974
without a B.F.F.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.185
We're making things permanent.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.227
Permanent?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.854
And you'll definitely
have to get a pager.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.941
I have to be able
to reach you 24-7.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.984
Uh...

17:49.067 --> 17:50.110
{\an1}Page me.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.157
We never even had
B.F.F. bracelets made.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.159
{\an1}We didn't want
to confuse the paramedics

17:57.242 --> 18:00.037
{\an1}'cause of my medical
alert bracelet, remember?

18:00.120 --> 18:00.913
We've got to figure out a way

18:00.996 --> 18:03.165
to get her and Courtney
to make up.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.666
I mean, if I tell her
straight out

18:04.750 --> 18:06.376
we don't want her
hanging out with us...

18:06.460 --> 18:07.628
She'll just twist
whatever you say around

18:07.711 --> 18:09.671
and make it work for her.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.547
How does she do that?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.716
Why don't <i> we</i> do that?

18:12.800 --> 18:13.926
And anyway, everyone knows

18:14.009 --> 18:17.096
the only reason
she's hanging out with us

18:17.179 --> 18:18.013
is because she's desperate.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.308
I didn't mean that
how it sounded.

18:21.391 --> 18:21.725
Hey...

18:21.809 --> 18:22.726
You have an idea?

18:22.810 --> 18:27.356
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.901
I do.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.987
There's to be absolutely
no talking

18:34.071 --> 18:35.864
during this pop quiz

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
on the Louisiana Purchase.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.326
(<i> yawning</i> )

18:39.409 --> 18:44.331
I don't even think I could
say "Louisiana Purchase."

18:44.414 --> 18:46.917
{\an1}You just did,
but I get your point.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.544
If I catch anyone cheating

18:48.627 --> 18:52.631
it's an automatic F,
as in Foutley.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.678
Wouldn't it be cool
if we owned something that, like

18:57.761 --> 18:59.555
could tell if you cheated?

18:59.638 --> 19:00.931
Yeah, like a...

19:01.014 --> 19:02.683
BOTH:
Lie detector!

19:02.766 --> 19:03.809
(<i> brakes screeching</i> )

19:03.892 --> 19:04.852
What do you mean

19:04.935 --> 19:06.895
everyone says
I settled for you?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.605
I could have picked anyone.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.691
It's just that I owed you.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.484
Well, I believe you, but...

19:12.568 --> 19:15.362
{\an1}I don't want people
thinking that I'm desperate

19:15.445 --> 19:16.405
which I am not.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.656
I mean, that would
make me pathetic

19:17.739 --> 19:18.490
which I'm not either.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.701
I'm going to have
to transfer schools!

19:20.784 --> 19:23.370
Wouldn't it just be easier
to make up with Courtney?

19:23.453 --> 19:26.707
What about Mipsy
and those B.F.F. bracelets?

19:26.790 --> 19:30.294
Come on,
Mipsy's no competition for you.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.754
Mm-hmm, yeah,
that's true.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.173
Of course, I can't
just make up like that.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.342
It's going to take
some finessing.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.845
I could help if you want.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.890
You'd do that for me?

19:42.973 --> 19:43.724
Sure.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.143
I'm not going
to owe you again, right?

19:46.226 --> 19:46.476
No, no, no, no, no.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.562
Oh, good.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.897
I don't think
I could handle it.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.982
All right, but
whatever you do

19:52.065 --> 19:55.861
don't make me look needy.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.283
Hoods! What have we done!

20:01.366 --> 20:04.036
It was the only used
lie detector in town!

20:04.119 --> 20:05.537
{\an1}And you know
what they cost new?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.373
Thousands.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.751
We let ourselves get...

20:10.834 --> 20:11.752
Soft.

20:10.834 --> 20:11.752
...soft.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.922
{\an1}Country club life has
completely dulled our edge.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.298
I couldn't help it, Carl.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.551
Everyone felt sorry for me,
kept giving me stuff.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.844
And I kept signing for stuff.

20:20.928 --> 20:24.181
{\an1}I thought I was
getting it for free

20:24.264 --> 20:25.140
but I really wasn't.

20:25.223 --> 20:29.478
{\an1}We've paid a heavy price,
my friend.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.188
Congratulations, Courtney.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.147
I hear you and Mipsy

20:32.230 --> 20:34.650
{\an1}are having friendship
bracelets made.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.777
(<i> giggling</i> )

20:36.860 --> 20:38.153
Well, actually, that was just

20:38.236 --> 20:39.821
a rumor I floated
to annoy Miranda.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.200
Sometimes it helps in order
to get her to come around.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.117
Come around?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.994
Oh, guess you haven't heard--

20:46.078 --> 20:47.913
she's transferring schools.

20:47.996 --> 20:51.458
What? She can't do that!

20:51.541 --> 20:53.585
{\an1}Then I'll have
to transfer schools!

20:53.669 --> 20:54.878
But what about Mipsy?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.046
Please.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.589
It's like choosing
shaving over waxing.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.342
Sounds like you want
to make up with Miranda.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.552
Between you and me

21:02.636 --> 21:04.471
it's not like I don't realize

21:04.554 --> 21:08.892
that sometimes
I take her for granted.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.478
{\an1}Do you think
if I apologize...?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.522
I forgive you.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.022
B.F.F.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.565
(<i> squealing</i> )

21:15.649 --> 21:16.566
Cor!

21:16.650 --> 21:18.485
Miranda!

21:18.568 --> 21:19.319
How should we handle this?

21:19.403 --> 21:22.948
{\an1}I mean, it's important
we both save face.

21:23.031 --> 21:27.995
Uh, why don't you just pretend
the fight never happened?

21:28.078 --> 21:29.079
Denial! Perfect!

21:29.162 --> 21:30.789
It always works
for Mama and Daddy.

21:30.872 --> 21:31.999
It always works
for Mama and Daddy.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.709
Share a decaf latte
in the cafeteria?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.209
{\an3}Love to.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.795
I've been so bored.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.422
Oh, I bet.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.465
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:44.803 --> 21:45.929
(<i> all gasping</i> )

21:46.013 --> 21:46.930
(<i> laughing nervously</i> )

21:47.014 --> 21:50.142
{\an1}Robert Joseph Bishop,
a patient of your husband's?

21:50.225 --> 21:56.314
He told me he was a...
a street urchin.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.361
(<i> sobbing</i> )

22:03.155 --> 22:04.114
{\an3}What?

22:04.197 --> 22:05.574
It's not like we
didn't work for it.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.534
No, Carl.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.744
We have to give it back.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.995
It's $400, Hoods!

22:10.078 --> 22:12.914
But they fired Mrs. Gripling.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.124
It wouldn't be right.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.625
We could put it in the bank--

22:15.709 --> 22:17.878
try to find another
used lie detector

22:17.961 --> 22:20.297
or pull some scheme
at the Country Club.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.590
Carl, I've had time to reflect.

22:21.673 --> 22:25.093
We lied to get a lie detector,
and then didn't get it.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.764
The big guy's sending us
a message here

22:28.847 --> 22:30.098
and I don't know about you

22:30.182 --> 22:32.768
but when the big guy
sends a message

22:32.851 --> 22:33.810
I try to pay attention.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.980
You're kind of my moral rudder,
aren't you, Hoods?

22:37.064 --> 22:41.026
