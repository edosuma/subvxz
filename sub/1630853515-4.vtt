25:11.968 --> 25:14.054
♪ ♪

25:39.913 --> 25:40.997
Ah!

25:52.092 --> 25:54.219
(ambient street noise)

26:24.165 --> 26:25.792
Who are you?

26:25.875 --> 26:28.211
We lived together
for five years

26:28.295 --> 26:30.964
and you don't
recognize me?

26:31.047 --> 26:34.009
-You can't be Jade.
-Why is that?

26:34.092 --> 26:36.970
Because, uh...
you are not here.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.805
You're not even in France.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.891
You are in Hong Kong,
or in London,

26:41.975 --> 26:43.977
or... or god knows where.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.064
Didn't this used
to be my flat?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.649
Yes, it was.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.528
How did you get in?

26:53.611 --> 26:59.075
Didn't you use to say...
I was a... spirit?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.619
I said a, a free spirit.

27:01.703 --> 27:07.167
Free spirits appear
and disappear at will.

27:09.002 --> 27:14.049
How many years...
since, uh, we divorced?

27:14.132 --> 27:16.092
-Ten?
-No.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.387
More like 12.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.640
I haven't...
heard from you since.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.851
You know full well
why you didn't.

27:24.934 --> 27:25.852
René: No.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.522
No, I never got it.

27:29.606 --> 27:33.276
But, uh, I don't want
to rehash painful memories.

27:51.544 --> 27:53.671
So, you're
remaking "Irma Vep."

27:53.755 --> 27:55.840
René: No, not really.

27:55.924 --> 27:59.427
Uh, I'm extending it
into a series.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.929
And without me?

28:01.012 --> 28:04.224
Uh, you don't act anymore.

28:04.307 --> 28:08.436
No, I don't want to be
an actress anymore.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.813
Or maybe...

28:09.896 --> 28:11.815
you want to be remembered

28:11.898 --> 28:14.192
forever in your prime.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.236
Do you really remember me?

28:22.826 --> 28:25.453
I remember the good times.

28:25.537 --> 28:30.375
I remember... how much
we were in love.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.629
But, uh...

28:34.712 --> 28:38.675
I don't, uh, remember
the person you really were.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.928
I loved you.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.808
But I'm not sure I knew you.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.438
I'm a different person.

28:51.521 --> 28:55.775
I've been in and out of love.

28:55.859 --> 28:59.279
I lived many lives
in many cities.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.239
And it...

29:04.117 --> 29:05.869
all feels so...

29:07.370 --> 29:08.288
unreal.

29:08.371 --> 29:12.041
Sometimes, uh,
I Google you...

29:12.125 --> 29:14.878
but I immediately
close the window.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.254
I don't want to know.

29:16.337 --> 29:21.676
Your films sometimes
come out in Hong Kong.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.053
-I avoid them.
-Huh.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.264
There's too many ghosts.

29:29.350 --> 29:34.481
So, how does it feel remaking
"Irma Vep" without me?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.733
It's another movie.

29:36.816 --> 29:39.986
You know, like...
all films are different.

29:40.069 --> 29:44.449
But then...
the ghosts of "Irma Vep"

29:44.532 --> 29:48.495
are not just ghosts,
they're our ghosts.

29:48.578 --> 29:53.291
Meaning...
I should have, uh,
discussed this with you?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.126
Yes.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.046
You never responded
to my e-mails.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.381
True.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.592
I-I need a cigarette.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.762
(sighs)

30:28.535 --> 30:29.619
Jade?

30:32.539 --> 30:33.623
Jade?

30:36.584 --> 30:40.129
No, I'm fine going
to China for Dreamscape,

30:40.213 --> 30:42.215
but three cities tops.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.092
In and out, right?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.344
Yeah. One location, one night.

30:46.427 --> 30:49.097
Okay, then it's back to LA
for the Dreamscape commercial.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.850
-(phone buzzing)
-Three days... Four max.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.603
Yeah, and then I'm... done.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.689
Well, you'll do some
magazine covers.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.065
Good for us, good for them.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.317
Show up on
the fashion circuit.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.278
Paris, Milan, New York.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.529
It'll be painless, okay?

31:04.612 --> 31:06.030
Bring your friends,
they'll pamper you.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.866
-I don't wanna be pampered.
-Well, I will show up personally

31:08.950 --> 31:10.910
to make sure
they don't even try.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.204
Mira:
That's not what I meant.

31:14.789 --> 31:17.292
Gautier will throw you
a party in Paris, right,

31:17.375 --> 31:19.294
he'll show you off
to his investors.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.504
All you have to do
is flash your smile,

31:21.588 --> 31:24.591
make them happy,
and then you're outta there.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.217
Mira:
Thank god.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.428
Okay, do we have a deal?

31:30.513 --> 31:31.723
Sure.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.517
-Cool. Talk to you later.
-(hangs up)

31:34.601 --> 31:36.436
(exhales)
Yes!

31:36.519 --> 31:38.187
Mira:
Ah, morning.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.064
Regina:
Good morning.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.774
Looks like a bad day?

31:41.858 --> 31:45.320
Thanks. (chuckles)
Uh, spoke to Zelda.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.113
She closed
the Dreamscape deal.

31:47.196 --> 31:50.783
Told you to avoid that shit.
It makes you so miserable.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.410
It's part of my job.

31:52.493 --> 31:56.456
-Yeah, it's not
the most ethical part.
-Oh, spare me.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.833
Okay, if Dreamscape allows
me to do "The Vampires,"

31:58.916 --> 32:00.084
I'm fine with the deal.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.337
You can do whatever
you want...

32:02.420 --> 32:03.504
you're a big star.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.341
Oh, you're so far off.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.927
You call me a big star
'cause these luxury brands

32:10.011 --> 32:12.764
get me on magazines
and billboards.

32:12.847 --> 32:17.518
Not because I've been...
lucky enough to make
a few good movies.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.270
Why are you up so early?

32:19.354 --> 32:20.355
You have a late call today.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.358
I'm gonna go and see René.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.400
Regina: Why?

32:24.484 --> 32:27.612
(chuckles)
He texted me, like, at dawn.

32:27.695 --> 32:30.490
He said he needed
to talk, like, now.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.741
-Now.
-Where?

32:31.824 --> 32:33.159
His place.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.453
You're actually willing
to go to his place?

32:35.536 --> 32:36.704
For what?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.916
For a hug and a croissant.
(laughing)

32:39.999 --> 32:41.417
You want me to come with?

32:41.501 --> 32:43.544
Absolutely not.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.088
Could be safer.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.799
-Is that cold milk?
-Waiter: Yes.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.719
Uhh, you can
stay in the car.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.055
Do you want me
to show you his text?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.556
Yeah, I'd love to see his text.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.017
It is quite funny.
(laughing)

33:00.186 --> 33:02.939
Regina:
"Please, Mira."

33:03.022 --> 33:04.774
What meds is he on?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.372
(doorbell rings)

33:23.042 --> 33:23.835
Mm.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.211
Uh, uh...

33:25.294 --> 33:27.046
are you coming in?

33:29.006 --> 33:32.760
Yes... Yes, I'm coming in.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.934
Coffee?

33:40.017 --> 33:41.185
-Are you having one?
-Yes.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.272
Um, sure, yeah.
Then I'll have one, too.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.566
Make yourself comfortable.

33:46.649 --> 33:50.611
You know, um,
I was supposed to be
on set an hour ago,

33:50.695 --> 33:52.238
but I just can't go.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.407
I woke up
in the middle of the night.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.869
-I had to speak to someone.
-Sure.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.624
Yes, well, uh, my shrink,
uh, blocked my number.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.126
Oh, I-I don't blame her.

34:05.209 --> 34:08.963
I called her over
20 times last night.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.883
Sorry I'm in,
I'm in a bathrobe.

34:11.966 --> 34:16.095
Yeah... No.
No worries.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.056
I didn't have the energy
to get dressed.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.226
-Uh--
-Anxiety?

34:22.310 --> 34:23.561
I-I lend you this one.

34:23.644 --> 34:26.147
These pictures,
they are my kids.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.025
Yeah. I thought, yeah.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.235
It's nice photos, yeah.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.657
Who am I?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.619
-Who are you?
-Yes...

34:39.702 --> 34:41.162
who am I...

34:41.245 --> 34:45.374
to tackle the work of a director
like Louis Feuillade?

34:47.251 --> 34:48.544
-(chuckles)
-Sugar?

34:48.628 --> 34:50.963
Uh, no, no thanks.
Um, but...

34:51.047 --> 34:53.716
you're doing something
completely different.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.178
You already
reinvented it once
and it was amazing.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.681
No... No, he, he
intimidates me.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.643
-"The Vampires"
intimidates me.
-Right.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.354
How can I do something
better than that?

35:07.563 --> 35:09.857
He, he wrote the playbook.
Don't you think?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.275
I like it well enough.

35:11.359 --> 35:14.987
You know, it's,
um, it-it's graceful,
very inventive,

35:15.071 --> 35:17.865
but... it's
no masterpiece.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.159
It's no Dreyer or Lang.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.995
(phone ringing)

35:23.079 --> 35:25.832
-Uh, excuse me.
-Uh, I-I, uh, I think--

35:25.915 --> 35:29.752
I-I think it's
in the kitchen.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.005
(phone ringing)

35:34.966 --> 35:36.509
Uh... oh!

35:43.975 --> 35:47.061
Why? Why even touch it if I know

35:47.144 --> 35:50.648
nothing I do could
ever stack up against it?

35:50.731 --> 35:52.692
I think you're mistaken.

35:52.775 --> 35:54.485
I think we're
on the right track.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.528
-No.
-No?

35:55.611 --> 35:57.905
No. N-N-Not at all.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.575
I should never have
gotten involved in this.

36:00.658 --> 36:01.909
Uh...

36:03.369 --> 36:07.623
Hello. (chuckles)
Uh, what about me?

36:07.707 --> 36:09.625
No, you're,
y-you're great.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.045
You're... You're always great.
You, you, you are genius.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.797
-Don't go overboard.
-No.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.425
You are magic...
You have some magic.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.011
I've lost it,
if ever I had it.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.597
Wow, you're being
self-indulgent.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.436
-I can help you
get over that.
-How?

36:28.519 --> 36:31.188
First of all,
stop whining.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.066
(phone ringing)

36:39.322 --> 36:42.116
-It's, uh... Carla.
-Don't answer.

36:42.199 --> 36:44.535
-No?
-Please, no.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.370
Okay.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.835
I...

36:53.961 --> 36:56.297
I-I had a dream.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.924
You had a dream?

36:59.717 --> 37:05.181
Jade Lee... visited me
and, uh, she talked to me.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.602
Was she angry with me?

37:09.685 --> 37:12.647
No... Ab-About what?

37:14.941 --> 37:19.028
About... me taking
over her part.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.781
About someone else
playing Irma Vep.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.783
No, she wasn't angry.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.826
She was very quiet...

37:27.411 --> 37:30.581
but, uh, she left me
doubting myself.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.000
The movie I made
with Jade happened

37:33.084 --> 37:36.420
-in unique circumstances.
-Like any art, right?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.965
All that was
fresh and pure...

37:39.048 --> 37:42.176
will be stained
and, uh, compromised.

37:42.259 --> 37:44.679
Doesn't sound
very encouraging.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.097
But, uh...

37:46.180 --> 37:48.099
you can save it.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.934
Can I? (chuckles)

37:50.017 --> 37:51.310
-Yes.
-Well, I have to.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.105
-This is all
we have right now.
-(phone ringing)

38:00.111 --> 38:02.738
That's, uh, what
you have been doing.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.325
You are making it
relevant again.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.077
How am I doing that?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.871
You have faith.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.790
And, and, and
your heart is pure.

38:12.873 --> 38:15.042
-My heart is pure?
-Yeah.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.254
Wow.
That sounds straight
out of a fairytale.

38:18.337 --> 38:20.047
I don't think
my heart is pure.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.341
You don't believe
in fairytales?

38:24.552 --> 38:25.553
I do.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.638
It's why I texted you.
You understand.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.891
Movies are fairytales.

38:30.975 --> 38:31.934
Not all of them.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.812
-Yeah, but o-only the best.
-(chuckles)

38:34.895 --> 38:38.607
-(phone ringing)
-I think they need us.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.027
So, I will get dressed.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.070
Yeah...

38:43.154 --> 38:45.531
that's an excellent idea.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.867
-(phone ringing)
-And I'm gonna
just open the door,

38:47.950 --> 38:50.161
-if that's okay with you.
-Please.
