WEBVTT

00:38.204 --> 00:40.165
-
And with the promotional discount,

00:40.248 --> 00:42.417
combined with your Auto Club discount,

00:42.500 --> 00:43.418
-your refill...
Uh...

00:43.501 --> 00:46.504
It says outside that you also honor
competitor's coupons.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.089
That is true.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.592
So, including that, your total is...

00:51.051 --> 00:54.179
Uh, looks like we owe you three dollars.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.855
Sir, this price war is bleeding us dry.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.232
We can't keep selling propane at a loss.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.693
Yeah, well, I ain't never lost
a price war,

01:08.777 --> 01:10.403
and I don't intend to start now.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.076
Passions always run so high
around Propane Expo.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.745
Uh, Joe Jack, give me a hand
outside with the sign.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.206
-Sure, honey. What's up?
You're fired.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.542
There. Now I just saved us
400 bucks a week.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.503
Wait. I need this job.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.671
Sorry, no room in the lifeboat.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.554
Well, I guess that's how shoes
get stuck in trees.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.306
And purses.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.851
Hey, baby doll.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.022
The radio just said Brownsville Station
are doing a reunion tour

01:46.106 --> 01:48.399
"Still Smokin' In The Boys' Room."

01:48.483 --> 01:50.235
Brownsville Station

01:50.318 --> 01:52.403
is your favorite band ever.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.531
They inspired him to play guitar.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.199
And to smoke.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.701
Let's go to the Agora Theater
and get us some tickets.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.037
Can I come? I don't have shoes.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.206
The Station's not about shoes.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.208
They're about rock. Come on.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.294
<i>-♪ Smokin' in the boys' room ♪</i>

02:09.420 --> 02:12.006
<i>♪ Smokin' in the boys' room ♪</i>

02:13.341 --> 02:15.385
Thatherton's doing it again, Hank.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.886
-He's up to 3-for-1.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.890
Now, when Mr. Strickland comes back,
he's gonna want the 4.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.309
It's our job to say we can't find it.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.520
You know who was a really good liar?

02:25.728 --> 02:26.980
Joe Jack.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.022
He'll be okay.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.817
I got him a job at the Propane Expo
this weekend.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.777
You know, to tide him over.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.155
Oh, that's great. What's he doing?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.615
Uh, he's wearing a sandwich board.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.618
He's gonna be the restroom arrow guy.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.080
We can't go on like this, Hank.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.040
The more we sell, the more we lose.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.792
The more we lose, the more we sell.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.170
I'm having a panic attack.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.462
Enrique, get a grip.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.673
Get your heads out of the oven, folks.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.885
I hired those fellas
from the <i>American Chopper</i> show

02:56.968 --> 02:58.928
to make an appearance at the Expo.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.680
I love those guys.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.183
Uh, the way they fight
and build motorcycles.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.685
Yeah, yeah, well, right now,
they in Dallas

03:05.768 --> 03:08.188
building a bike for some
billionaire computer geek,

03:08.271 --> 03:11.357
but I convinced them
to make a little detour to Arlen.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.402
You take that, you son of a bitch.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.280
I got myself some basic cable TV stars.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.450
Huh, I would've thought
big-name guests like that

03:20.533 --> 03:22.660
would charge an awfully steep
appearance fee.

03:22.744 --> 03:27.040
Well, that depends on where $20,000 sits
on your steepness radar.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.541
Twenty thousand?

03:28.625 --> 03:33.504
Sir, I'm not sure this is the best use
of our limited financial resources.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.839
Well, I am.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.175
From now on, whenever people
watch <i>American Chopper,</i>

03:37.258 --> 03:39.010
they'll think Strickland Propane.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.137
Like whenever I see a blimp,

03:41.221 --> 03:43.473
I think of that company, you know...

03:43.723 --> 03:44.807
What is it, again?

03:45.391 --> 03:47.936
Anyway, it's called "branding."

03:48.019 --> 03:51.105
Ah, you hear that, Thatherton?
You hear that AA-1?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.441
I'm gonna brand all your asses.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.114
What are you doing sitting on your butt?

04:00.198 --> 04:03.117
We gotta get that bike on the floor
of the Javits Center by Friday.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.410
<i>I'm reading a magazine.</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:06.788
<i>You stupid, stupid idiot.</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:10.959
I'm not sure these are the guys
to be representing Strickland Propane.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.794
They seem to fight an awful lot.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.171
Yes, but they are celebrities, Hank,

04:15.255 --> 04:18.466
and studies show that people
would rather watch celebrities fight

04:18.549 --> 04:20.385
than regular people make love.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.136
Well, people at work

04:22.220 --> 04:23.888
sure seemed excited about 'em.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.223
Maybe it'll be okay.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.642
<i>Hey, Pop,
how do I look on this bike?</i>

04:28.768 --> 04:30.979
<i>Now you got something to do,
Paulie, clean that up.</i>

04:32.480 --> 04:34.732
So, Lucky, when do tickets go on sale?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.568
One hour and six days.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.781
That's a long time
to stand in line without shoes.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.702
Let's go home and order tickets
when they're for sale on the Internet.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.495
You want to get the best seats, don't you?

04:48.079 --> 04:52.375
Well, how can you tell if you're first
in line on the Internet? You can't.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.085
If I'm here, I can see it.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.838
Line starts behind me.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.885
<i>Attention.</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:05.847
<i>The grilling demonstration
will start at 3:00.</i>

05:06.097 --> 05:07.348
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:09.350 --> 05:12.353
I can't believe the <i>American Chopper</i> guys
are here in Arlen.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.023
Which Teutul is your favorite?
Mine's Paul Sr.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.734
He looks like a walrus
but yells like a man.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.694
I tell you what, man,
that dang ol' Paulie Jr.'s

05:19.777 --> 05:21.404
like the dang ol' show, man.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.282
That Spiderman bike, man?
Talkin' 'bout dang ol' epic, man.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.826
You know, some believe
there was a fourth Teutul,

05:26.909 --> 05:30.747
but he fell into a vat of chrome
and was turned into a bitchin' sissy bar.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.916
Well, I guess Buck was right.
Look at all these people.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.838
So, Hank, are they bringing a motorcycle
made with propane tanks,

05:38.921 --> 05:43.134
one that runs on propane,
or one that just looks like propane?

05:43.217 --> 05:45.803
I don't know.
Buck handled all the negotiations.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.139
Oh, my God.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.433
It's the state regulatory commissioner.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.437
Uh, having a good time,
Commissioner Evers?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.522
I'm not here to have a good time, Hill.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.024
Well, I am.

05:58.107 --> 06:01.027
Damn it, Dale,
you don't mouth off to a commissioner.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.654
They give licenses
and they can take them away.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.744
So, Walter, what do you think
your customers are gonna like better,

06:09.827 --> 06:14.749
my boys from <i>American Chopper</i>
or your free refrigerator magnet, huh?

06:19.879 --> 06:23.758
Hey, Jerry Sandoval, have some ChapStick,

06:23.841 --> 06:25.843
you're about to kiss my ass.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.556
Afternoon, everyone.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.309
I'm Buck Strickland
from Strickland Propane

06:33.393 --> 06:36.896
and I think I know
what you all are here for.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.648
Yay!

06:38.731 --> 06:40.942
<i>American Chopper</i> rules.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.278
Now let's have a big
Strickland Propane welcome

06:44.362 --> 06:46.447
for the guys from <i>American Chopper</i>

06:46.531 --> 06:51.702
the two Pauls and Mikey,
presented by Strickland Propane.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.712
We love you, Mikey.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.133
Let's hear it for Paulie and Mikey.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.467
And Pop.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.012
Boy, if the crowd is this fired up,
just wait till they bring out the bike.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.181
Way to go, Mikey. Big time.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.392
-That's what I'm talkin' about.
-Yes.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.735
Bring out the bike!

07:26.529 --> 07:29.407
Bike. Bike. Bike. Bike.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.827
Bike. Bike. Bike. Bike. Bike.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.621
Hey, Strickland,
is this all they're gonna do?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.082
Yeah, they don't even have a bike.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.750
I've got magnets.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.044
I'm going over to Thatherton Fuels

07:42.128 --> 07:45.381
to get a free pamphlet
from Miss December 1978.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.799
This is bogus!

07:46.883 --> 07:50.928
Uh, sir, what exactly are they gonna do
for the next half hour?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.930
I don't really know.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.016
I'm not a fine print kind of guy.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.226
Hey, any of you fellas bring a chopper?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.895
A... a helmet?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.021
Something?

08:00.104 --> 08:03.441
I wanted to bring the NASCAR bike,
but these chuckleheads didn't finish it.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.692
Maybe I coulda finished it

08:04.775 --> 08:06.777
if you would've stopped asking
every five minutes

08:06.861 --> 08:07.904
when I was gonna finish it.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.531
Okay, numb nuts,
I'm startin' to get aggravated here.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.995
Ooh!

08:16.078 --> 08:17.246
Hey, let go of the hat.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.498
It bounced off my face.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.833
Hey, fruitcake, that's my boy's hat.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.878
Don't make me come down there
and use this size 12 on your face.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.344
Uh, would you join me
in the singing of our national anthem?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.311
Rock and roll!

08:49.487 --> 08:53.658
Yikes. This is one ugly story
about Strickland Propane.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.370
But it does have your name in it,
so it's going right in the scrapbook.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.999
We're making those animals at Natural Gas
look like choirboys.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.928
Okay, now, let's all calm down.
You're grown men.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.265
Arlen Hospital can't handle
two bypasses at once.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.268
Buck, it's the Teutuls.
They want their appearance fee.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.270
Yeah. Come on, Buck. We got work to do.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.147
You got lucky this time, Thatherton.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.902
Uh... you're breathing pretty heavy, sir.
I'll handle this.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.366
Could you keep it short, Hank?
I got a job interview on the other line.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.286
This is Hank Hill, Assistant Manager,

09:38.369 --> 09:41.330
and we are not gonna pay you
for inciting a riot.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.749
<i>You stupid, stupid idiot.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:44.709
Oh, God.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.545
No time to pray.
We got to turn things up a notch.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.088
I'm gonna put on some cologne

09:49.171 --> 09:51.549
and renew my acquaintance
with Jerry Sandoval's wife.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.217
That will show him we mean business.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.975
Being bored all day makes me hungry.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.477
Not to worry. I came prepared.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.771
Let me dip into our provisions.

10:07.356 --> 10:11.152
Could I have a sandwich
with something on it besides bread?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.320
Soon, Bobby.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.030
Once people start lining up,

10:14.113 --> 10:17.074
we'll be able to trade
for anything your heart desires.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.578
Lunch meat, pickles,
Brownsville Station bootlegs.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.079
Oh, good.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.206
Here's Elvin with our comfort station.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.586
I can't go in a Porta-Potty.
I'm going to find a ladies' room.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.796
Whoa. You can't leave, baby.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.633
No saves-ies. It's the Code of the Line.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.761
But I can't hold it for five days.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.598
I have to get going. I got homework to do.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.769
-Nuh-uh. You can't go if I can't go.
-Hold on, Bobby.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.228
Are you still in school?

10:46.312 --> 10:47.438
Seventh grade.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.482
Then run along, professor.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.568
What about the Code of the Line?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.905
The Code acknowledges
that the children are our future.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.917
I got a call about the sweepstakes.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.504
-I'm here to pick up my portable TV.
-Over here, Walter.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.215
What the... What... What's going on?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.467
The sweepstake was a lie, Walter.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.469
But I did get you each a television.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.889
I had to test drive four minivans
just to get them,

11:21.972 --> 11:24.308
but it'll be worth it
if I can sit the four of you down

11:24.392 --> 11:27.687
-and get you to stop this insanity.
-They started it.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.314
Mr. Strickland, forgive me, but shut up.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.900
You're acting like a baby. You all are.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.360
You're grown businessmen.

11:34.443 --> 11:38.030
We're only hurting ourselves
with this senseless price war.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.200
Why not pool our experience
to serve our customers better?

11:41.283 --> 11:42.702
And stop insulting them

11:42.785 --> 11:45.579
by charging less than our product
is really worth.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.084
It would be nice to charge enough
to at least break even.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.087
Yeah, sure. But then one of you bastards
will undercut me.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.006
That's why we have to stop
all this backstabbing.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.301
Now, if you had quit wasting
your energy on this price war

11:59.385 --> 12:02.555
and pulled together for a change,
imagine what you could accomplish.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.934
Buck, I think your boy
might be on to something.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.060
Yeah.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.731
When you think about it,
I guess we all want the same thing.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.107
Thanks, Ol' Top.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.233
We really owe you.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.945
Now, why don't you run out and order us
some pie and ice cream and such

12:18.028 --> 12:19.280
so we can celebrate.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.531
Can do, sir.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.076
So, we all agreed?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.455
We all jack up our prices,
and we keep them there.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.665
No backstabbing. No competing.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.625
Just like Hank said.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.171
Of course, y'all know
this is highly illegal.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.884
We'd better drink on it.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.055
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

12:45.139 --> 12:48.267
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

12:48.350 --> 12:50.227

12:50.311 --> 12:52.271

12:52.354 --> 12:54.857

12:54.940 --> 12:57.651

12:57.735 --> 13:00.070

13:18.172 --> 13:20.925

13:21.926 --> 13:24.720
Sure feels good to be back at my old desk

13:24.804 --> 13:26.472
with all these new pens.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.183
Yep.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.851
Things have really turned around

13:30.935 --> 13:34.230
since Buck and the others decided
to start acting more responsibly.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.981
Hi. Yeah.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.318
I went to Pine Creek Propane
to sign up for home delivery, but

13:39.401 --> 13:40.861
they, they told me to come over here.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.531
Walter sent you here?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.825
It's all right, Joe Jack.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.244
We're divvying up our accounts
by zip code now.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.163
Less time on the road,
and more time serving the customer.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.874
Hank, we're off to shoot us
some whitetails

13:53.958 --> 13:54.959
and whatever else moves.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.379
Why don't you just lock up the fort,
get a head start on the weekend?

13:58.462 --> 14:01.298
But it's barely 4:30. And it's Thursday.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.802
Who wants to go to the water park?

14:09.723 --> 14:13.018
God, we thank you
and your servant Buck Strickland

14:13.102 --> 14:14.979
for putting this food on the table.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.480
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Hill.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.233
If we could have a word, the rest of you
can go back to your prayer.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.528
Commissioner Evers?
Uh, if I knew you were coming...

14:22.611 --> 14:24.113
Bobby, get him a plate.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.656
Oh, my gosh.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.076
Are you here to give Hank
some kind of state propane award?

14:29.159 --> 14:31.287
Well, this is a surprise.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.832
I am here as part
of an ongoing investigation

14:34.915 --> 14:37.418
against Strickland Propane,
Pine Creek Propane,

14:37.501 --> 14:40.504
AA-1 Propane and Thatherton Fuels.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.840
What? What kind of investigation?

14:42.923 --> 14:46.635
It appears your associates,
also known as The Heimlich Four,

14:46.719 --> 14:50.848
have joined in a criminal conspiracy
to engage in price-fixing.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.808
Price-fixing? That's crazy.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.353
Under an arrangement masterminded by you.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.360
Not to pile on,
but the meat's a little overdone.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.869
All the evidence points to collusion.

15:11.952 --> 15:15.623
Prices rising sharply and in unison,
sharing of customers,

15:15.706 --> 15:19.126
excessive profits among
what used to be fierce competitors.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.838
Commissioner, I swear
on my Blue Flame of Valor award

15:22.922 --> 15:25.215
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.842
Don't play dumb.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.137
We know you're the brains
behind this whole illegal cartel.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.765
This month's TPGA newsletter:

15:32.848 --> 15:35.976
"I am happy to have brought
these dealers together

15:36.060 --> 15:40.022
in a new spirit of cooperation,
said Hill."

15:41.732 --> 15:45.027
I ought to pull your Hazmat certification
right now.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.406
You have to believe me,
I never meant to start an illegal cartel.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.368
I love propane,
I'd never do anything to hurt it.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.413
Well, I guess there is something
you could do to convince me.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.207
I want you to wear this wire.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.835
Get The Heimlich Four
incriminating themselves on tape.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.879
Do that, and you walk.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.217
What am I gonna do?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.635
I can't wear a wire.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.928
You have to, Hank.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.055
If you don't, they will send you to jail.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.890
The only decision you have to make

16:14.974 --> 16:17.351
is whether to shave
your chest or your back.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.812
You don't understand,
this is all my fault.

16:19.895 --> 16:24.024
I tempted Buck and the others
with no competition and huge profits.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.277
It was like waving a whiskey bottle
in front of an alcoholic.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.488
Fine. It's your decision to make.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.198
But if you do end up going to jail,

16:31.281 --> 16:33.617
please do not tell them
it was over propane

16:33.701 --> 16:35.119
or they will eat you up.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.955
I give you permission
to say you murdered me.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.748
Hopefully it won't come to that.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.001
Wait a minute.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.262
Testing, testing, one, two...

16:55.055 --> 16:57.182
<i>Testing, one, two...</i>

16:57.266 --> 16:59.268
Hey, maybe we could take the wives

16:59.351 --> 17:00.686
to Switzerland for New Year's.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.272
You know,
do a little skiing, visit our money...

17:06.650 --> 17:08.819
Uh, good morning, Mr. Strickland.

17:08.902 --> 17:12.114
Sirs.
Uh, can I interest you in some coffee?

17:12.197 --> 17:14.450
Donuts? Anything?

17:14.533 --> 17:17.327
What, you got the palsy,
or is the AC on the fritz?

17:17.411 --> 17:19.204
If it's the latter, bring us a fan.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.499
We'll be in my office
discussing matters of consequence.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.334
-Uh, but...
-Sounds like the palsy.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.545
No fan. But bring in some coffee.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.005
Try not to spill it.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.477
It's the Teutuls.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.234
Let me guess, you want to beat
your appearance fee out of me.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.863
No, it wasn't right the way
we came here unprepared

17:52.946 --> 17:53.822
and started a riot.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.991
You understand how kids
sometimes don't listen

17:56.075 --> 17:57.910
when you try to tell them
what needs to be done.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.663
Hey, I'm not the one who sang a song
called "Twenty Grand" on our lunch break.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.417
The point is, we want
to put on a decent show.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.629
We brought some bikes. I rode one. Watch.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.340
Well, it's too late for a show.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.299
I told you so.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.343
Look, I'm really starting
to get aggravated.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.303
I don't want to have
this conversation again.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.388
I told you once...

18:33.070 --> 18:35.656
There is something you can do for me.

19:21.702 --> 19:26.206
Which is why I think
we should form our own ethics committee.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.377
One with even higher standards
than the commission that oversees us.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.548
-Yes, I agree.
-As do I. Even more so.

19:34.631 --> 19:38.510
I, Jerry Sandoval,
have been saying that for years.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.058
Here comes the gorilla.

19:45.142 --> 19:48.687
Oh, no, looks like
he's got a propangatang, too.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.898
Thanks for keeping me out of jail, Hank.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.734
I burned some bridges with the Aryans
last time through.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.154
Thatherton Fuel's giving
an extra ten percent off on refills.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.322
Can you match that?

20:00.991 --> 20:03.285
Uh, no, ma'am, we won't.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.496
But what we will do
is calibrate your OPD valve

20:06.580 --> 20:08.040
and carry your tank to your car.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.042
That sounds okay.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.587
It sure does.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.803
Are the tickets finally going on sale?

20:21.887 --> 20:25.515
I hope so because I think
I might have bread poisoning.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.435
The Station appreciates your sacrifice.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.270
May I help you?

20:30.354 --> 20:33.148
I'd like three tickets
for Brownsville Station,

20:33.232 --> 20:37.653
directly in front of the speaker tower
to the left of the stage.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.906
You know those seats are obstructed view?

20:40.989 --> 20:45.285
Not when Mike Lutz climbs up there
and plays his guitar solo.

20:45.369 --> 20:49.289
For those ten minutes,
they're the best seats in the house.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.924
What are you waiting for now?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.385
The concert's not for another two weeks.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.346
I want to make sure
I get a T-shirt in my size.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.390
They always run out of ladies' medium.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.103
Line starts behind me.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.686
-<i>You stupid, stupid idiot.</i>
