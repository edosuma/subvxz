00:09.077 --> 00:10.278
- Hey, guys.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.113
We actually have
a great show tonight.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.781
We have Debra Messing...
- [gasps]

00:13.814 --> 00:16.317
- We have Mark Cuban
from "Shark Tank,"

00:16.350 --> 00:17.318
and we got animals.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.752
- [gasps] Which ones?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.554
- We got sloths
and cute little bunnies.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.790
- I love sloths, and I think
it's important to note

00:22.823 --> 00:24.792
that sloths only go
to the bathroom

00:24.825 --> 00:27.161
once a week,
a policy I think we should all

00:27.195 --> 00:29.597
adopt at this office
because the bathrooms here

00:29.630 --> 00:31.532
are disgusting
and I want you to know

00:31.565 --> 00:33.434
I've filed a formal report.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.636
- Yo, FYI, everybody.
I love "Will & Grace,"

00:35.669 --> 00:37.605
so this is a huge day for me.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.673
- Wow, I never clocked you
as a "Will & Grace" lover.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.742
- I'm gonna take a huge video,
just--just us two--

00:41.775 --> 00:43.277
well, a quick vid,
just a quick vid--

00:43.311 --> 00:45.446
- Oh, whoa, wait. [gibberish]
- What?

00:45.479 --> 00:47.348
- Todd, you're not gonna take
a video of Debra Messing.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.483
- It's for Instagram.
- For Jimmy's Instagram?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.852
- No. It--yeah.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.321
Shit, yeah, it's for mine.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.089
- Yes. I know.
- Yeah. I screwed up.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.691
- Good stuff. Um, Phil?

00:57.725 --> 01:01.362
Could you make sure
there's no...[mouthing words].

01:01.395 --> 01:03.497
- I--you cut out
on the last word.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.732
I didn't hear it.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.567
- Can you make sure
that nobody

01:06.600 --> 01:10.271
is taping the celebs?

01:10.304 --> 01:11.872
- Okay, but isn't that
why they're here?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.607
- Okay, can you make sure
that Todd

01:13.641 --> 01:15.543
doesn't videotape
Debra Messing?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.245
- [snorts]
- No, thank you.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.846
- You're security!
- Yeah, okay.

01:18.879 --> 01:22.216
Todd, please promise me that--

01:22.250 --> 01:23.384
- No.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.753
- I mean, my hands
are tied, right?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.555
He said what he said.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.658
- From Studio 9B in the heart
of New York City,

01:30.691 --> 01:33.794
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

01:33.827 --> 01:36.130
Tonight: there's no
"Messing" with her.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.466
It's Debra Messing.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.335
Reality TV's most beloved
billionaire since Trump,

01:41.369 --> 01:43.504

And now the man who's
number five in the ratings,

01:49.510 --> 01:51.579
but number one in our hearts,

01:51.612 --> 01:53.614
here's Jimmy.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.617
[energetic brass music]

01:56.650 --> 01:58.819
* *

01:58.852 --> 02:00.521
- Oh, hey, Staci.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.790
Can I have, like, an hour
to pitch an idea to Mark Cuban?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.225
- No.
- Okay.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.759
I can do it in probably,
like, 45 minutes.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.228
- Um, listen to me, Randy.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.496
Your job is to walk in,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.164
mic the guest,
and then get out.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.465
- That's such a good idea.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.600
I'm gonna pitch it to him
when I mic him.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.801
- Randy, look at me in the eye.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.769
Your job is to mic
the celebrity,

02:15.803 --> 02:17.638
not speak to them,
and get out.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.173
- I will be speaking
to Mark Cuban, though.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.674
- You will not be speaking
to Mark Cuban.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.909
- Yes, I am.

02:21.942 --> 02:26.280
*

02:26.314 --> 02:27.715
- Hi, ladies.
- [gasps]

02:27.748 --> 02:30.384
- Oh, my God! Tim Gunn!

02:30.418 --> 02:31.719
- Hi.
- Hi!

02:31.752 --> 02:33.687
- I just wanted you
to know that I'm here.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.723
- Well, that's terrific.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.258
- Why are you?

02:37.291 --> 02:39.593
- I'm doing a pop-by
on tonight's show.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.763
- That's exciting.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.498
What's a "pop-by"?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.367
- Well, I saw Jimmy
last night at Nobu,

02:46.400 --> 02:47.601
and he said to come by the show

02:47.635 --> 02:49.637
anytime for a pop-by.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.505
- Well, look at Jimmy,
booking the show.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.441
- Mm-hmm!
- Good.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.509
Can you take Tim Gunn
to his dressing room?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.646
- Great, um,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.514
can you just give us
a moment, Mr. Gunn?

03:00.548 --> 03:01.882
- Of course.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.752
- Yeah, we're just gonna...
make it work.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.554
- Great. Make it work.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.456
- I'm gonna try.
- Oh, Staci.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.757
You always make it work.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.692
- Well, thank you, Tim.
I try.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.227
And I will try now
to make it work.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.663
- Make it work!
- I am making it work.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.265
- We're gonna
make it work,

03:17.298 --> 03:19.367
and maybe you can in the hallway
for one moment.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.503
- Of course I can!
I'll make it work out here.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.472
Make it work!

03:24.505 --> 03:26.907
- I love him so much.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.676
But what are we gonna
do with him?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.244
Our show is completely full.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.912
- Fuck Jimmy.
You know, he just--

03:31.945 --> 03:33.347
every time he goes
around town

03:33.381 --> 03:34.648
and just invites people
to be on the show,

03:34.682 --> 03:35.849
it really screws up my job.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.385
- [groans]

03:37.418 --> 03:38.919
- Look, we have Mark Cuban
in dressing room two.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.721
We have Debra Messing
in dressing room one.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.590
We have the sloths.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.525
I can't ask anybody
to share a dressing room

03:44.558 --> 03:45.793
with another celebrity.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.895
- I don't know
which I love more:

03:47.928 --> 03:49.763
Tim Gunn or sloths.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
- Ah, you know what?
Tim Gunn trumps sloths.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.534
So I'm gonna get rid
of the animals.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.470
You go give Tim Gunn
a dressing room.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.938
*

03:57.971 --> 03:59.407
- Did anybody
see you come here?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.309
- No.
Penny did, but she's stupid.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.877
All right, now,
you cleared this with Staci?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.347
- Yes.
- All right.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.881
This is just the prototype.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.417
Remember, okay?
- I get it. I know.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.684
Please, open the box.
- Ready?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.486
- Yes.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.391

04:17.425 --> 04:19.827
- Do you hate them?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.596
- They're perfect.
- [gasps]

04:22.630 --> 04:25.533
- Oh, my God, Marcus.
You're a genius.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.734
- I know.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.068
- You should've gone
to art school.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.970
- I did.
- Oh. Sorry.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.673
- We're gonna make millions.
- Billions.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.941
- Well, probably not billions.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.643
- Millions.
- Millions.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.480
- Hi, Todd.
- Hey.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.515
- You look really nice today.
- Okay, great.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.384
What's up with this whole
guest change thing

04:43.417 --> 04:44.852
with Tim Gunn?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.421
That's--that's not
Jimmy-approved, you know?

04:47.455 --> 04:50.090
I mean, Tim Gunn makes Jimmy
feel really self-conscious

04:50.123 --> 04:51.859
about the way he dresses, and--

04:51.892 --> 04:53.827
- No, it's fine, because, uh,

04:53.861 --> 04:56.330
Tim Gunn ran into Jimmy
at Nobu,

04:56.364 --> 04:57.665
and Jimmy told him to stop by.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.099
- Oh, well,
Jimmy can't remember

04:59.132 --> 05:00.901
every promise he makes,
you know?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.537
- That was last night.
- Jimmy's famous.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.440
I mean, that--
time happens differently.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.410
- Staci is on the phone
right now

05:09.443 --> 05:12.045
canceling the animal trainer
to make room for Tim Gunn.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.882
- What? No! Whan! He--

05:14.915 --> 05:17.718
He's been wanting to pet that
sloth for decades, all right?

05:17.751 --> 05:18.852
- No--
- It's on his bucket list.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.954
Get rid of Tim Gunn!

05:23.023 --> 05:25.693
- Staci!

05:25.726 --> 05:27.361
- Balls.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.462
What?

05:28.496 --> 05:31.499
- There's an emergency!

05:31.532 --> 05:33.767
- Well, come and tell me
what it is.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.504

to have you here.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.147
I can't tell you how hard
it's been to get you on.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.517
Okay, so, um,
any funny stories

05:49.550 --> 05:51.585
about the remake
of "Dirty Dancing"?

05:51.619 --> 05:52.853
- Well, actually--
- No.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.623
We're not talking
about "Dirty Dancing."

05:55.656 --> 05:56.990
- Okay, we noticed
on Instagram,

05:57.024 --> 05:58.526
you always wear
a lot of jewelry.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.894
Is there a Debra Messing
jewelry line?

06:00.928 --> 06:03.163
- No. We're not doing that.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.399
- Are you dating anyone?
- No.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.671
but let's save that
for "People" magazine,

06:10.704 --> 06:13.641
not "Nightcap with Jimmy."

06:13.674 --> 06:15.543
- Okay.
- Hey!

06:15.576 --> 06:16.810
Oh!
- Hey.

- Debra Messing. Wow.

- Hey, Staci.
- Thanks a lot. Buh-bye.

I wanted to--

06:25.486 --> 06:26.820
- No!
- No?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.989
- Nope.
- Okay. Bye.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.425
- I'm so sorry.
He came with the job.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.627
- Ah.
- Right this way.

- Hi!

- Good heavens!
- Hello!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.466
- Is the circus in town?
- Yeah.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.434
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.202
- Good heavens.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Gunn.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.472
We're a little bit full today.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.173
Do you mind sharing
a dressing room?

06:46.206 --> 06:47.841
- Oh, of course not.
I don't want to be any trouble.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.043
I mean, after all,
I'm only doing a pop-by.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.211
- You're the greatest.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.746
Um, I'll let you guys
get settled.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.781
- Thank you, Penny.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.616
And what is this?

06:55.649 --> 06:56.950
- It's a two-toed sloth.

- Oh. Good heavens.

I've always wanted
to meet a sloth.

- Hi, Todd.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.028
I still feel welcomed.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.764
- Uh, no, I came here 'cause
I wanted something from you.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.765
- Oh. Goody.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.567
- I just want to get a picture.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.935
For my niece.

Um, it's my sister's kid
out of wedlock.

Katinka! Mm.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.909
She's nine, and, uh,

07:21.942 --> 07:24.244
she really loves you,
and, you know,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.780
it'd just be great
to get that photo, um--

07:26.814 --> 07:28.616

07:30.117 --> 07:31.919
- Yes.
- Oh. Of course.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.186
Anything for a sick child.

- Oh, really?
- Yeah, sure.

of the nice ones, Debs.

- Oh, your name.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Yeah.
- De--Debra.

- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Got it.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.500
I won't mess that up.
I might mess it up.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
- No.
- Okay, I won't mess it up.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.969
- Yeah. I'll help you.
- Awesome.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.638
Hey, you know what, Deb-ra?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.906
Um, can I--can I actually
get a video?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.074
- Sure. Sure, of course.
- Really?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.609
- Yes. Yes.
- Awesome.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.545
Oh, man, so,

07:57.578 --> 07:59.980
yeah, whenever you're
ready--and action.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.281
- Hi, Katinka.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.850
- All right, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.852
Sorry, um, can you not
mention her name?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.554
'Cause it's, like,
a little formal.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.557
Uh, we actually call her
"T-man."

08:09.590 --> 08:12.993
'Cause her T cell counts
are low.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.095
- Does she have AIDS?
Is she an AIDS baby?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.797
- Oh, my God.
Yeah, she is.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.231
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.900
- Okay. All right.
- Horrible.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.802
- I--
[sighs] All right.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.136
Any--anything you need.
Go ahead.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.672
- Thank you so much.
- Yes. Yes.

08:24.705 --> 08:28.075
- All right, and let's just
get that going.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.643
- Hi, T-man.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.078
I'm so sorry
you're not feeling well.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.179
- And cut.
- I--

08:32.212 --> 08:33.747
- Um, can you not mention

08:33.781 --> 08:35.282
the whole "sickness" thing?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.217
'Cause we want to keep this
upbeat, right?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.687
Okay, so let's do it again
real quick.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.154
And action.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.290
- It's so great to talk to you.
- Great. Cut.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.958
Can we actually do it
one more time?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.027
Can you do it as Grace?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.596
You know, your--the--

08:48.629 --> 08:50.263
'Cause she doesn't know
who Deba Mess is.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.199
Deb-ra Mess-ing is. Yeah.
- De--

08:52.232 --> 08:53.701
- But she knows Grace.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.202
- I guess if you think
it'll help.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.837
- Awesome. Thank you.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.171
Uh, I'm gonna get
some audio stuff

08:58.205 --> 08:59.940
and--and lighting things.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.842
- Wha--wait. What--what?
Oh, God.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.115
[energetic brass music]

09:08.148 --> 09:11.084
- Oh, my. How lovely.
Thank you.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.152
- Oh, no. This is not for you.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.353
This is for Eugene,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.055
who was actually booked
on the show.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.626
Here you are, Eugene.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.860
Do not touch it.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
- Oh, my.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.665
- Okay, remember:
you're Grace Adler.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.300
You live in New York City
with your husband, Will.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.902
- Did you ever watch the show?

09:28.936 --> 09:30.638
- Yeah. Every episode.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.172
Action!
- Uh, hi.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.707
Hi, it's me, Grace Adler.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.308
- Okay, cut. Real quick.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.711
Can we make it, like,
a little less formal?

09:37.745 --> 09:39.747
- Yeah, and with more passion.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.782
- Yeah. Yeah, let's up
that passion.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.917
Okay. And action.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.720
- Hi, It's me, Grace Adler,

09:46.754 --> 09:48.355
T-man.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.058
I just wanted to say that I hope
you're having a good day

09:51.091 --> 09:53.193
and that me and Will
are in New York

09:53.226 --> 09:54.695
right now, thinking of you.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.296
- Cut!
It's "Will and I."

09:56.329 --> 09:58.732
I'm kind of a grammar nerd.
- Yeah, but Grace isn't.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.133
Who the fuck
is this guy anyway?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.002
- Sorry, yeah, let's just
ignore him real quick.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.203
We're on a roll here,

10:03.236 --> 10:05.038
so let's just pick it
right back up.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.174
- Okay.
- Sticking to your script here.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.776
- Yeah.
- And action.

10:08.809 --> 10:12.012
- Hi, it's me, Grace Adler,
T-man.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.048
I just wanted to say that I hope
you're having a good day

10:15.082 --> 10:18.085
and that Will and I
are in New York right now,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.286
thinking of you.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.691
And Jack and Karen are--

10:23.724 --> 10:25.158
are on the way over...

10:25.192 --> 10:26.326
- [whispering] Yes. Good.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.162
- And, uh, hope you can make it.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.298
- And cut! Oh, my God.
That's a wrap.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.866
- Oh, good.
- That is so good.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.835
Thank you so much.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.070
- I'm exhausted.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.239
- Well, hello, Mr. Sloth.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.374
How's it hanging?
[chuckles]

10:41.408 --> 10:43.076
That was funny, Tim.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.144
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.813
- Oh. Goodness.
- Look at this.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.015
- This is incredible.
This is an animal kingdom.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.817
- It's a little menagerie.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.885
- Tim, we've had a little bit
of a technical glitch.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.353
- Oh.
- And because of that,

10:53.386 --> 10:55.923
we have to push the show back,
so I'm so sorry.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.825
- Oh, listen, Staci,
I understand.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.827
- So we have a limo
outside waiting,

10:59.860 --> 11:01.361
and he can take you
anywhere.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.930
- Oh, Staci,
I don't mind waiting.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.932
I've been up since 5:00 a.m.
for a photo shoot,

11:04.965 --> 11:06.800
and frankly, I'm exhausted,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.802
so having this time
just to rest and relax

11:08.836 --> 11:10.437
is, frankly, welcome.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.405
- Tim, here's the thing:
we are overstuffed.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.307
We have too much going on
in the show tonight.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.044
Uh, it just--
it's not a good night for you.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.913
- But this is the only night
that I'm available all season,

11:19.947 --> 11:21.815
and since Jimmy asked me,

11:21.849 --> 11:23.183
I don't want to disappoint him.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.885
- Okay. Bear with me.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.754
* *

11:26.787 --> 11:28.121
- Hey, Mr. Cuban.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.322
Hi, if we could just have

11:29.356 --> 11:31.058
a very long moment
of your time.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.492
- I-I'm doing business
here, guys.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.161
I'm trying to make a trade
for DeAndre Jordan.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.763
- All right, I have no idea
what that is,

11:35.796 --> 11:37.430
but we're about to make you
filthy rich.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.332
- Dude, I'm already rich.
That's my thing.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.901
- Hello, shark.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.003
My name is Randy,
and my business is--

11:43.036 --> 11:44.337
- Our business.

11:44.371 --> 11:48.141
- My business is Ma'Bangs.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.509
both: Ma'Bangs!

11:49.542 --> 11:52.479
- I am seeking $1.38 million

11:52.512 --> 11:54.982
for a 2% stake in my business.

11:55.015 --> 11:55.983
- Our business.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.517
- You're valuing that

11:57.550 --> 12:00.287
at $69 million?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.123
- Yes, and you are about
to find out why.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.026
Now, surely you've heard
of man buns, right?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.961
Well, this is the future

12:07.995 --> 12:10.230
of men's hair care
accessories.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.299
This is...

12:15.335 --> 12:17.270
both: Ma'Bangs!

12:17.304 --> 12:19.406
- I mean, can you even tell
this is fake hair?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.141
It's flawless, right?

12:21.174 --> 12:24.978
- This is a product by men,
for men, of men.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.080
- What does that even mean,
"Of men"?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.917
- For centuries,
women have had it easy,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.419
with the freedom
to change their hairstyle

12:32.452 --> 12:35.322
on a whim to go
with the occasion,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.257
the outfit, the mood.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.159
- While men
have been imprisoned

12:39.192 --> 12:40.560
by whatever they're given.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.796
Now, God acts
in mysterious ways,

12:42.830 --> 12:45.165
but God is irrelevant now,
because I...

12:45.198 --> 12:47.134
- We--
- Have created...

12:47.167 --> 12:48.168
- Ma'Bangs!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.103
- For the man who likes to bang.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.575
- Hey, Deb-a-deb.
Uh, sorry. Debra.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.010
- Todd, we did five takes.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.813
- Can you, uh,
come with me real quick?

12:59.847 --> 13:01.014
- What?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.350
- Yeah, it's just, um,

13:03.383 --> 13:05.218
real quick, if you can just

13:05.252 --> 13:06.987
sit down here.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.555
- W-what--what's going on?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

13:08.588 --> 13:12.225
Yeah, just--just have a seat,
Grace--on the Grace throne.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.095
Real quick, I just had
to do one more take.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.396
[sighs]

13:16.429 --> 13:18.465
You know, I-I was
at the editing bay,

13:18.498 --> 13:21.134
and I just saw the footage,
and it looked horrible.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.036
I mean, the lighting was off,
the makeup--

13:23.070 --> 13:25.438
it was totally my fault,
and I'm sorry about that.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.441
But you looked awful.
I mean, you looked terrible.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.077
You look--you looked like
if you were, like,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.045
dipped in a--in a bowl of acid

13:32.079 --> 13:34.281
and you came out and you did,
like, a head flip

13:34.314 --> 13:37.184
and your whole face flew off,
it was kind of around there.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.052
- Okay, just, let's--
one more take.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.955
- She'll do one more! Aw!
What a pro!

13:41.989 --> 13:44.091
- Let me just check you.
Okay, you look shiny.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.226
And Grace cannot be shiny.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.995
- Why is the chef
doing my makeup?

13:48.028 --> 13:49.462
- Because the makeup guy
is pitching

13:49.496 --> 13:52.565
a preposterous idea
to Mark Cuban in the other room.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.367
- So is the sound guy.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.569
[laughs]
They're always up to something.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.338
- Wow, there are
some serious problems

13:58.371 --> 13:59.907
in the staffing for this show.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.375
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.244
- It's okay. I'm--I'm--

14:04.277 --> 14:06.013
I'm happy to do a video

14:06.046 --> 14:08.448
for this--this very brave
little girl.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.884
- What little girl?
- Oh, my, uh--

14:10.918 --> 14:13.053
my cousin--uh, I mean, niece.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.022
- You don't have a cousin
or a niece.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.057
- Yeah, I do! She's sick.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.659
- She's sick with what?
- AIDS.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.394
- AIDS?
- Okay, you know what?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.996
Can we ju--let's just--
let's just do this,

14:23.030 --> 14:24.564
and we can be done with it,
okay? Okay?

14:24.597 --> 14:25.665
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.367
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.902
- One, three, action.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.938
- Hi, it's Grace Adler,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.272
and I just wanted to say

14:32.305 --> 14:33.941
I hope you're having
a lovely day

14:33.974 --> 14:36.109
and that Will and I
are in New York right now--

14:36.143 --> 14:37.978
- Nah--
- And we're--what?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.113
What? What? What?
- No, no. I'm not buying it.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.015
- Me neither.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.683
- Feels like you haven't
played the role in a while.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.520
- Um, she played it for eight
critically-acclaimed seasons.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.656
- Eight seasons.
- Eight? I thought it was two.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.224
- Season three was the best.
- Agreed.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.625
- Oh, I got an idea!

14:52.659 --> 14:54.294
Why don't we do a little
role-playing, you know?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.996
Jog the memory a little bit?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.464
I'll be your husband, Will.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.666
- I can play Karen.
- Well, I could play Grace.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.168
- Would you shut the fuck up?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.235
- Whoa.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.636
- Well, you both
can play Grace.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.305
- I'm Grace!
- You definitely play Grace.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.940
- I'm Grace, the whole point is,
I'm Grace Adler!

15:06.974 --> 15:08.508
- The rumors are true.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.010
- Why don't you play
all the roles?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.511
- Uh, all of 'em. All right.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.280
- Just like Eddie Murphy.
Do Eddie Murphy doing 'em.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.581
- Okay.
- Action.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.450
- Hi, it's Grace Adler.
And Will.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.953
[higher pitch] And Karen!
And Jack!

15:19.987 --> 15:21.521
And we just want you to know

15:21.554 --> 15:23.957
that we're thinking of you
here in New York.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
- [whispering] T-man.
- T-man.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.230
[energetic brass music]

15:30.263 --> 15:31.999
- [mumbling to self]

15:32.032 --> 15:34.034
- Oh.
- Hey.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.036
- I cannot believe
you shot that video.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.070
- Yeah, isn't it amazing?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.506
She just, like,
became Grace.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.342
- And I'm sure it's great,
but we're not gonna post it.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.144
- Yeah, I got to.
- No, you don't.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.579
- Yeah, I'm going to.
- No, you're not going to.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.048
- Yeah, I am.
- No, you ain't.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.449
- Yeah'am.
- Y'ain't.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.717
- Yam.
- Y'ain't!

15:50.750 --> 15:51.985
- Yam!
- Y'ain't!

15:52.019 --> 15:53.020
- Yam!
- Y'ain't!

15:53.053 --> 15:55.022
- What are you doing?
Oh, no!

15:55.055 --> 15:58.291
Oh, what?
I'm telling Jimmy about this.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.560
- So, Mr. Cuban,
what do you say?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.062
Are you in?

16:02.095 --> 16:06.133
- Guys, your pitch was awful.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.468
Your presentation was worse.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.238
Your product is hair
on a string.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.740
It's sad. Sad.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.142
- Sad or--
- Sad.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.543
- Or brilliant?
- Sad!

16:16.576 --> 16:18.378
- Okay.
- But.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.413
And I can't even believe
I'm telling you this.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.015
I've never admitted this
to anybody,

16:22.049 --> 16:24.251
and please don't tell anybody,

16:24.284 --> 16:26.553
but...

16:26.586 --> 16:28.155
I'm one of those men.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.624
I-I used to be able to grow
bangs when I was a kid,

16:31.658 --> 16:34.527
and the memories
of playing with my bangs,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.563
chewing on my bangs,

16:36.596 --> 16:39.166
are some of my best memories.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.201
So, despite you guys,

16:41.234 --> 16:42.469
I like it.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.504
I like it!

16:44.537 --> 16:45.505
I'm in.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.639
[both gasping]

16:46.673 --> 16:49.309
I'm in.
- For $1.38 million?

16:49.342 --> 16:52.279
- Hell no.
That's a ridiculous valuation.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.015
But I'm in for $25,000.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.586
*

16:59.619 --> 17:01.421
- I think that's the problem.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.323
You've been on Grindr.
You're supposed to be on Tinder.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.524
- That's why
nobody swiped right?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.226
- Exactly.
- Hey. Guys.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.694
Guys, is Debbie still here?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.197
- Uh, no, she left.
- [sighs] Nut butter!

17:10.230 --> 17:11.564
[sighs] God.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.333
I need to reshoot
everything with her.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.502
The video's gone--
all the footage,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.170
it's--it's disappeared.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.706
Like magic--not like good magic.
Like evil magic.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.276
Like Dungeons & Dragons.
- That's a drag.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.577
- Sucks.
- God.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.845
All right, I'm gonna
go on the roof.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.414
Jimmy said it might be
in the clouds.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.616
- Okay. Bye.
- Good luck.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.152
- Damn.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.087
- Did you delete that video?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.488
- I just don't think Todd

17:35.522 --> 17:37.190
should have his cell phone
just strewn about,

17:37.224 --> 17:39.559
with his password being
Jimmy's birth date.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.828
[laughter]
- You're my hero.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.733
- Titty twister!

17:46.766 --> 17:48.535
- I love you.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.504
[audience laughing]

17:53.906 --> 17:55.675
- Mr. Cuban, you were great.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.544
And you look phenomenal.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.412
- So virile.
- Don't call me "virile."

17:59.446 --> 18:00.613
- Okay. I'm sorry.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.615
- So how did you feel
out there?

18:02.649 --> 18:03.816
Confident?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.352
- You didn't hear them
laughing at me?

18:05.385 --> 18:06.853
- No. No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.655
They were laughing with you.
You're hilarious.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.123
Everybody loves you.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.258
- This was
the worst idea ever.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.425
I don't know
what I was thinking.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.294
I-I'm a frickin'
laughingstock.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.163
And for that reason...

18:16.196 --> 18:17.430
I'm out.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.567
- Oh, no.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.670
What are we gonna do?
- Oh, now it's "we"?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.572
And for that reason,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.440
I'm out.

18:27.474 --> 18:31.611
*

18:31.644 --> 18:33.680
- Oh, no.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.283
Tim Gunn.
- Where is he?

18:36.316 --> 18:37.684
- To my knowledge, he's still

18:37.717 --> 18:39.819
in the sloth's dressing room
where I left him.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.454
What do we do?
- Okay. All right. Okay.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.789
Okay, you know what?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.591
I've been in this profession
for a long time.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.726
This is what you do:
you tell the truth.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.429
No matter what mess
your boss puts you in,

18:49.462 --> 18:52.165
you attack it head-on.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.700
You take a bullet for him.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.269
Doesn't matter if he's
a narcissistic,

18:56.303 --> 18:57.637
egomaniacal,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.872
psychopathic man.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.775
And that's me being kind.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.743
This him?

19:06.713 --> 19:09.716
- Aw.
He's all tuckered out.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.784
But I'll go wake him up.
- No, no, no, no, no!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
Shut up!

19:13.353 --> 19:15.222
Let's just get our stuff and go.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.556
He's on his own.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.429
[melancholy
acoustic guitar music]

19:22.462 --> 19:29.402
*

19:34.274 --> 19:37.344
- Oh, honey.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.879
It's too late for you.

19:39.912 --> 19:46.853
*
