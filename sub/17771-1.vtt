00:07.041 --> 00:08.750
(narrating)
Hi. I'm Ryan Walker.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.417
And you may not be able
to tell right now,

00:10.500 --> 00:12.041
but I have a gift.

00:12.125 --> 00:13.917
Not like my older brother Mark,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.917
who has a gift for basketball,
baseball, football,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.792
martial arts...
pretty much every sport.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.792
He's the most awesome
kid in the universe.

00:22.875 --> 00:23.834
Just ask him.

00:23.917 --> 00:25.458
I am awesome.

00:25.542 --> 00:28.000
-My gift was... different.
-(alarm blaring)

00:28.083 --> 00:29.875
And at first,
I thought it was bad luck.

00:29.959 --> 00:33.625
Like everything electronic
was out to get me.

00:33.709 --> 00:35.083
(alarm blares)

00:35.166 --> 00:37.291
Alarm clocks buzzing at me...

00:44.750 --> 00:46.375
Toasters attacking me...

00:46.458 --> 00:47.458
Ugh!

00:49.125 --> 00:50.750
Are you sure
we're related?

00:50.834 --> 00:53.208
Even cars were
throwing shade at me.

00:53.291 --> 00:56.041
(car alarms blaring)

00:56.125 --> 00:58.667
Then something
amazing happened.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.125
(beeping stops)

01:03.917 --> 01:05.667
I figured it out.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.709
My gift was a power.

01:07.792 --> 01:08.792
(alarm resumes)

01:10.041 --> 01:12.083
(chuckles)

01:12.166 --> 01:14.959
I learned if I concentrate...

01:15.041 --> 01:17.000
Blocked?

01:17.083 --> 01:18.375
Guess again.

01:18.458 --> 01:22.375
...I can control technology
with my mind.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.125
Heh. Cool.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.792
-(grunting)
-Whoa!

01:28.875 --> 01:30.166
Also cool.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.667
Harris, Spyder,
you guys are my best friends,

01:34.750 --> 01:36.083
what do you think?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.709
I don't know, Ryan, those all
could have been coincidences.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.291
I'm gonna need more proof.

01:40.375 --> 01:44.542
Okay, you want proof?
I'll give you proof.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.500
(laughing)

01:51.583 --> 01:53.500
Reconsidering all the data...

01:53.583 --> 01:54.583
dang, son!

01:54.667 --> 01:56.583
You're like
a human remote control!

01:56.667 --> 01:57.875
What do we do with this?

01:57.959 --> 01:59.792
What do we do with this?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.667
Anything we want.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.917
(theme music plays)

02:24.000 --> 02:25.583
Did you swim in that lake

02:25.667 --> 02:27.583
-by the chemical plant?
-No.

02:27.667 --> 02:28.917
Were you struck by lightning?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.417
I think I'd remember that.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.458
Bitten by a spider?

02:31.542 --> 02:32.542
I don't do that anymore!

02:32.625 --> 02:33.458
Then what?

02:33.542 --> 02:36.458
I'm sorry, Harris, there's
no elaborate origin story.

02:36.542 --> 02:37.667
-I'm sorry.
-(P.A. system beeps)

02:37.750 --> 02:40.166
Attention, students,
this is Principal Grey,

02:40.250 --> 02:44.208
welcoming you to another
exciting year at Bay City High.

02:44.291 --> 02:45.792
Go Fighting Llamas!

02:45.875 --> 02:48.083
-Mark! Mark! Mark...
-(Grey) And go, Mark Walker.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.083
He is awesome.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.959
And to our new students,

02:52.041 --> 02:54.500
I know starting high school
can be stressful.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.000
My door is always open.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.250
And here's a fair warning:
I'm a hugger!

03:00.500 --> 03:03.750
And older students,
go easy on the freshmen.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.458
We can't afford another
wedgie-based lawsuit.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.291
That kid is still walking funny.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.250
Hey, guys,
maybe you shouldn't...

03:12.417 --> 03:14.208
Ugh!

03:14.291 --> 03:16.000
(All)
Hurt locker!

03:16.083 --> 03:17.667
(laughing)

03:22.250 --> 03:24.834
Oh, man, we really stuck it
to the newbies this year.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.709
Man, good work on
those trash flingers.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.458
I am the king of fling.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.250
I really hope this is
peanut butter in here.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Heh, peanut butter cup.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.709
-Get it?
-Okay.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.208
So Mark wants
to play pranks?

03:42.291 --> 03:43.875
I can play pranks.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.417
(bell rings)

03:46.500 --> 03:47.792
(whistle blowing)

03:47.875 --> 03:49.250
Okay, you guys.

03:49.333 --> 03:53.917
Keep your eye on the waste truck
and keep your eye on varsity.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.500
Let's see how funny they think it is
when they're coated in gunk.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.208
I don't know, Ryan. There could
be unintended consequences.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.458
You know what?
My friend Harris here,

04:02.542 --> 04:03.709
he makes a good point.

04:03.792 --> 04:05.750
But just hear me out. Do it.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.250
I'm gonna have
to go with Spyder.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.834
Aah! Oh!

04:19.458 --> 04:22.375
Ah! Something's wrong
with my power.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.625
Turn it down!

04:24.709 --> 04:26.750
I'm trying!

04:32.542 --> 04:34.333
(All)
Oh, no...

04:38.250 --> 04:39.834
Hi. Cassie Park.

04:39.917 --> 04:43.542
That's CassieP on Gramogram,
SparkNet and EveryVid, streaming live.

04:43.625 --> 04:46.667
Now, tell me, how does it feel
to be the only freshmen

04:46.750 --> 04:49.125
ever to be double-dumped on
the first day of school?

04:49.208 --> 04:51.125
Annoyed. Now that
it's on the Internet.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.959
(chuckling)
Looks like lunch is on him.

04:56.375 --> 04:57.750
Looks like lunch...

04:57.834 --> 04:59.041
is on him.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.041
(laughing)

05:01.125 --> 05:02.291
Mark.

05:02.375 --> 05:05.166
Dude, you're gonna be famous for more
than just being my little brother.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.417
I don't want to be all,
"I told you so,"

05:11.500 --> 05:13.959
so I'm gonna say it in Spanish.
Te lo dije.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.542
Okay, everything
was working fine.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.625
It's just I got distracted

05:18.709 --> 05:20.667
by, like, a vision.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.417
Of abandoned cars.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.500
When I have visions,
it's usually of...

05:26.583 --> 05:29.500
Ariana Grande... then cake.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.417
Yeah, mine was a junkyard
by a river.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.333
Yeah, my visions are better.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.500
Cars, river, junkyard.

05:37.583 --> 05:38.792
Anything else?

05:40.583 --> 05:43.667
Yeah, a ferry.
A huge abandoned ferry.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.417
-Like this?
-Yeah, that.

06:24.583 --> 06:25.583
Whoa.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.583
What are you doing
to that lamp?

06:28.667 --> 06:30.291
I'm not doing anything.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.709
I think the lamp
is scanning me.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.417
If that is a lice test,
I am totally gonna fail.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.166
(rumbling)

07:00.583 --> 07:02.375
You guys seeing this?

07:08.041 --> 07:09.041
Whoa.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.250
(screaming)

07:21.959 --> 07:23.875
(screaming)

07:26.125 --> 07:29.250
(screaming continues)

07:33.375 --> 07:34.542
Aah!

07:39.667 --> 07:41.083
Whoa.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.625
(machine whirring)

07:47.500 --> 07:50.667
-Don't touch anything!
-But I want to touch everything.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.625
Ryan, we don't know if...

07:55.709 --> 07:57.792
No, this feels right.
Trust me.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.500
-Hi there!
-(All) Aah!

08:12.583 --> 08:14.959
Welcome to Mech-X4.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.125
If you're seeing this,
it means two things.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.834
One, you are a technopath,

08:19.917 --> 08:22.291
who can control machines
with your mind.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.083
Guys, you hear that?

08:25.166 --> 08:27.208
I'm a technopath.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.208
And two, I'm in hiding.

08:29.291 --> 08:32.166
Or probably dead.
Dead would be a bummer.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.083
Eh.

08:33.166 --> 08:37.083
Mech-X4 is a complex weapon
that can only be piloted by you.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.500
Reach out to it
with your power.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.125
(powering up)

08:51.500 --> 08:52.709
And you're linked.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.750
Guys, I'm bonded to this robot.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.917
I'm moving the robot.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.917
Mech-X4 will now
mimic your actions.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.792
So, I bet if I jumped...

09:30.834 --> 09:32.083
Pretty cool, right?

09:32.166 --> 09:34.792
I... I hope it's cool.
I assume it's cool.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.250
I don't know.
This is a recording.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.667
Hopefully, you're a strong enough
technopath to operate Mech-X4,

09:39.750 --> 09:41.959
because you cannot imagine
the horrors coming your way.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.750
Monsters as big as the robot,
if not bigger.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.834
You're gonna need a team
if you're gonna save Bay City.

09:46.917 --> 09:50.583
Weapons and defense.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.625
Now, the most
important thing...

09:53.709 --> 09:56.625
is... the most important thing...
important thing... the most...

09:56.709 --> 09:58.667
Is what?
That could be important?

09:58.750 --> 10:01.000
I call weapons.
That's important.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.291
He just said monsters.

10:02.375 --> 10:03.667
And maybe he's right.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.333
Or maybe he filmed
this years ago

10:06.417 --> 10:07.959
and no monsters
have shown up?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.000
So we can do whatever
we want with this thing.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.917
Don't you want to know why
that guy built a robot

10:13.000 --> 10:14.875
specifically for someone
with your powers?

10:14.959 --> 10:16.667
Or we can have fun
with this thing

10:16.750 --> 10:19.041
and do all that stuff later?
What do you say?

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
Okay, I'm with Ryan.

10:20.458 --> 10:23.834
This is a giant battle bot.
We need to understand it.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.417
When you get a new toy,
you read the manual.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.875
-I don't.
-And that's why all your...

10:26.959 --> 10:28.959
Christmas presents
last until December 26th.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.083
Dude, I'm Jewish.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.375
Okay, you're right, you're right.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.208
Until we can figure this out,

10:33.291 --> 10:34.709
we have to be
responsible with it.

10:34.792 --> 10:35.834
There we go.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.041
You know, see what it does.
Test it out. Train.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.125
Exactly.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.667
So, we're in agreement.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.041
What did I just agree to?

10:43.125 --> 10:45.458
(impact wrench whirring)

10:45.542 --> 10:47.333
That should do it.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.583
Gun it.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.709
(motor revs)

10:50.792 --> 10:52.417
How'd you get
this beauty to start?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.333
You give me a set of tools,
I can fix anything.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.125
(chuckles)

11:09.667 --> 11:12.375
"Mark Walker,
least awesome."

11:12.375 --> 11:15.208
Okay, who's spreading lies?

11:19.333 --> 11:21.333
And this is responsible how?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.125
I'm training, see?

11:23.208 --> 11:26.500
I'm learning how
to pick up dumpsters...

11:29.583 --> 11:31.291
-Okay.
-(Ryan) And now,

11:31.375 --> 11:33.125
I'm learning how
to empty them.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.625
Aah!

11:37.959 --> 11:39.875
-Haha.
-(groaning)

11:39.959 --> 11:41.917
(laughing) Okay.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.875
Now I'm learning how to take
the video Spyder just sent me

11:45.959 --> 11:48.041
and anonymously
post it to the Internet.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.333
-See? Training.
-Not what I meant.

11:50.417 --> 11:51.959
Well, you should have
been more specific.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.333
I cannot wait to see
the look on Mark's face.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.709
(screaming)

11:56.792 --> 11:58.959
(laughing)

11:59.041 --> 12:01.000
Oh, hey, Mark.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.291
This is only a seven-second video,

12:03.375 --> 12:06.333
but every time I watch it,
I find something different to laugh at.

12:06.417 --> 12:07.917
Not cool, man.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.458
Oh, but it was
when you did it to me?

12:09.542 --> 12:12.250
That was different.
It was a prank, that was funny.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.375
Nope.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.333
What, you didn't think it was
a little funny? Everybody laughed.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.583
I mean, they did. At me.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.208
(screaming)

12:27.125 --> 12:28.291
-So, I'm a...
-Yup.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.709
And me laughing at you
makes me a...

12:29.792 --> 12:31.291
-Huge...
-Wow.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.834
I know it's always been
varsity vs. freshmen,

12:33.917 --> 12:36.917
but I should have had your back.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.583
I mean, you'd never do
something like that to me.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.458
What? No.
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.000
Of course not.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.458
I guess I'm sorry.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.208
We cool?

12:47.291 --> 12:48.458
Yeah, frosty.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.667
(people chatting)

12:55.750 --> 12:57.333
(Girl)
Hey, look, there he is!

12:57.417 --> 12:58.583
Hey, saw your video.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.417
Well, you did it, Ryan.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.417
You used your giant fighting robot
to break your brother's spirit.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.208
Yeah, I... I thought it'd be fun
to take Mark down a peg,

13:06.291 --> 13:08.542
but now, I... I feel like a...

13:08.625 --> 13:09.875
Monster.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.500
I kinda do. I feel like a...

13:11.583 --> 13:13.500
No, actual monster!

13:13.583 --> 13:16.875
(roaring)

13:18.959 --> 13:20.959
(roaring)

13:21.041 --> 13:24.208
(screaming)

13:25.667 --> 13:26.834
What is that thing?

13:26.917 --> 13:28.625
You know, I could probably
get a good picture of...

13:28.709 --> 13:29.875
Not the time! Not the time!

13:29.959 --> 13:31.250
We need to get to Mech-X4.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.041
(rumbling)

13:34.125 --> 13:37.166
(roaring)

13:37.250 --> 13:39.500
Single-file, everyone!

13:39.583 --> 13:40.709
Single-file!

13:40.792 --> 13:43.250
Monster! Run! Run!

13:43.333 --> 13:46.542
You're all gonna die!

13:46.625 --> 13:48.625
Really could have
handled that better.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.333
(growling)

13:53.500 --> 13:57.458
Cassie Park streaming live on Gramogram,
and are you seeing this?

13:57.542 --> 13:59.291
(roars)

14:04.709 --> 14:06.333
-Ready?
-(Both) Ready!

14:06.417 --> 14:08.625
Mech-execute!

14:10.750 --> 14:13.458
We're doing catchphrases now, or...

14:16.375 --> 14:18.166
A monster! Run!

14:20.750 --> 14:22.500
Robot! Run!

14:27.792 --> 14:28.959
Spyder, when I say...

14:29.041 --> 14:30.166
Whoa!

14:33.750 --> 14:34.959
You fired too soon.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.000
Little new at this.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.500
Maybe if you'd
practiced a little...

14:42.709 --> 14:44.625
Aargh! Hey, how do
the shields work?

14:44.709 --> 14:45.917
Trying to figure it out.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.625
Okay, Spyder,
let's try this one more time.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.291
Aah!

15:05.333 --> 15:07.166
Aargh!

15:08.250 --> 15:09.792
Oww!

15:12.542 --> 15:13.709
Why'd that hurt?

15:13.792 --> 15:17.166
Probably your technopathy.
You are bonded to this robot.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.875
If the robot gets hurt,
you get hurt.

15:19.959 --> 15:21.208
This doing anything?

15:21.291 --> 15:22.959
-Feeling any better?
-No.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.875
Harris, you were right.
We should have trained.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.041
How do we beat this thing?

15:26.125 --> 15:28.750
Start pressing buttons
and learn as we go!

15:31.792 --> 15:33.333
Aah!

15:36.125 --> 15:37.375
Bam! Shields.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.375
Spyder, find me the biggest
weapon this thing has.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.125
Uh, shoulder missiles, lasers,

15:46.208 --> 15:47.875
and something called
a plasma punch.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.333
Looks like
a boss-level weapon.

15:49.417 --> 15:50.625
It comes out of
the cannon arm.

15:50.709 --> 15:53.417
It's busted,
I can feel it.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.542
A fourth team member?

15:55.625 --> 15:58.583
That's what the four
in Mech-X4 is.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.500
The fourth person
is a mechanic.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.375
Someone who can
fix the robot.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.166
I hate to say this,
but how 'bout your brother?

16:05.250 --> 16:06.792
No. Anybody else.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.875
Sure. Let's take a break
and flip through the yearbook.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.583
Maybe the monster will wait.

16:12.709 --> 16:14.917
Ryan? Ryan!

16:19.917 --> 16:21.917
Aah!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.417
Yeah, we had the same reaction.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.875
We're in a giant robot?

16:28.959 --> 16:30.208
What is going on?

16:30.291 --> 16:32.959
Short version: fighting a monster,
and I think I can beat it,

16:33.041 --> 16:35.375
-I just need you to fix the cannon arm.
-Is there a longer version?

16:35.458 --> 16:39.083
-(growling)
-(pop music playing)

16:41.542 --> 16:43.166
It's going to eat that girl!

16:43.250 --> 16:44.959
Hit him with the dumpster!

16:45.041 --> 16:46.166
Dumpster?

16:51.750 --> 16:53.709
Hey you, you big,
dumb cat lizard!

16:53.792 --> 16:55.542
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

16:55.625 --> 16:58.750
I saw this really cute
boy yesterday.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.333
You should have seen him.
He was so hot.

17:11.959 --> 17:13.959
(music continues)

17:14.041 --> 17:15.959
It was you!

17:16.041 --> 17:17.834
You dropped all
that garbage on me.

17:17.917 --> 17:21.208
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Not the time! Not the time!

17:23.583 --> 17:24.750
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.166
Aah!

17:30.208 --> 17:32.083
Oh...

17:33.750 --> 17:35.291
(laughs)

17:35.375 --> 17:37.917
Ugh.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.125
Wait, you're really hurt?

17:40.208 --> 17:42.333
I can't explain it,
and I know you want to kill me,

17:42.417 --> 17:44.500
but this robot's busted,
and you can fix anything.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.083
Ryan, calm down. I'll kill you later.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.875
What do you need me to do?

17:57.458 --> 18:01.166
(alarms blaring)

18:01.250 --> 18:03.500
(static crackling)

18:10.458 --> 18:12.417
(roars)

18:23.250 --> 18:24.792
Mark, whatever you're doing...

18:26.875 --> 18:28.000
I'm still doing!

18:34.041 --> 18:35.792
Nice.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.709
(gasps)

18:37.792 --> 18:39.208
-Aah!
-Ugh!

18:39.291 --> 18:40.709
Oh...

18:40.792 --> 18:41.875
Spyder!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.542
Okay, got it.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.834
(powering up)

18:54.917 --> 18:57.166
Whoo! Thank you, shop class!

18:58.542 --> 19:01.458
Okay. Feels better.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.542
(roars)

19:07.375 --> 19:08.750
He's coming in for the kill!

19:08.834 --> 19:12.542
-You got this?
-We got this. Spyder, plasma punch!

19:38.375 --> 19:39.542
Yes!

19:39.625 --> 19:41.500
Um, hey guys.

19:41.583 --> 19:42.625
Wait!

19:44.375 --> 19:46.875
-Hi, Cassie!
-She can't see you.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.291
(Cassie)
You saved the school!

19:49.375 --> 19:51.458
You saved us all.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.917
What's your name?

19:57.375 --> 19:59.709
"Mech-X4."

20:08.583 --> 20:09.875
Spyder:
Look at all this.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.709
-(Mark) Man...
-(all laughing)

20:11.792 --> 20:13.166
(Harris)
Dang, y'all.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.792
Whoa, there's a place
to chill in this robot?

20:16.875 --> 20:19.125
Yeah, it's 150 feet tall, dude.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.667
It's a lot to explore.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.583
I can't wait to trick this place out.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.792
Everything in there
looks really dangerous.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.375
Everything explodey is mine.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.583
Harris, this lab
is gonna be awesome for you.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.875
Check it.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.709
CassieP here on the giant robot beat
from Bay City High.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.542
CassTag: Grateful.
CassTag: Mech-X4.

20:39.625 --> 20:40.709
CassTag: CallMe!

20:42.917 --> 20:44.458
Do not call her!

20:45.625 --> 20:48.166
-So, texting?
-No. Ugh.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.959
Can you believe this?

20:50.041 --> 20:51.834
We beat an actual monster today.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.667
A giant monster.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.458
-This is...
-Insane?

20:55.542 --> 20:57.041
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.458
Over the summer you learned
you had a... a superpower?

20:59.542 --> 21:01.375
And found a giant robot.

21:03.375 --> 21:04.959
I don't know
what we're up against,

21:05.041 --> 21:08.542
but I know somebody
built this robot for me,

21:08.625 --> 21:09.917
for someone with my power.

21:11.709 --> 21:14.667
Harris, Spyder,
they volunteered,

21:14.750 --> 21:16.458
but I never asked you.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.625
Well, are you now?

21:17.709 --> 21:20.333
Instead of stepping on you
with a giant robot boot

21:20.417 --> 21:22.333
and sucking you into it, yeah.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.667
Well, we did kick butt out there.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.583
-So, teammates?
-Brothers.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.625
And teammates.

21:29.709 --> 21:31.875
But do not prank me
with this thing again.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.500
Don't give me a reason to.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.083
So, what do you guys want to do next?

21:42.083 --> 21:43.834
Let's see what this baby can do!

21:45.709 --> 21:48.208
Okay, so...

21:48.291 --> 21:50.959
We need to start coming up
with monster drills.

21:51.041 --> 21:54.917
If another one of these things attack,
we need our students to be safe.

22:03.500 --> 22:08.250
So... the city has a robot defender.

22:08.333 --> 22:09.500
(beeping)

22:09.583 --> 22:11.583
Didn't expect that.

22:11.667 --> 22:16.667
Well, the next monster I make
will tear that robot apart!

22:18.792 --> 22:21.625
(theme music plays)

22:44.542 --> 22:45.417
(barking)
