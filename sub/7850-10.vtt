What did you call me?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.909
I didn't have anything better to do.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.912
I do.

21:18.978 --> 21:23.316
I should be out buying cologne for
my study date with Amber this saturday.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.285
I thought she was unattainable.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.353
I "tained" her.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.489
High school is a roller coaster.

21:29.556 --> 21:34.494
Sure, it has it's ups and downs,
but now we're all together in one place...

21:34.561 --> 21:38.365
Detention. You, me, Nia, and London.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.536
Yay, me!

21:49.609 --> 21:50.944
I see you came prepared.

21:51.011 --> 21:53.646
Oh, yeah. I never come to detention
without bringing something to do.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.983
Last year, thanks to Zack,
I knitted 32 sweaters and an Afghan.

21:58.018 --> 21:59.953
This year, I'm rhine-stoning.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.888
You know, may I try it?

22:01.955 --> 22:02.956
Oh, yeah, sure.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.959
-Do you push your--
-Just right on the thing.

22:06.026 --> 22:07.093
Or do you have to-- Oh!

22:11.297 --> 22:14.234
BOTH:
Sorry, Ms. Militich.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.936
I will see you two tomorrow.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.408
[BOTH LAUGHING]

22:21.474 --> 22:22.509
It went: boop!

22:22.575 --> 22:23.810
Shush!
[YELLS]
