WEBVTT

01:47.608 --> 01:48.650
Here we are.

01:58.994 --> 01:59.995
Dorothy?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.623
The sedative I put in your pizza
might unsettle your stomach,

02:02.706 --> 02:04.833
so you should get down what you can.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.544
How did I get--

02:13.258 --> 02:17.179
-Tobe?
-Yes, your friend, Tobe, brought you.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.847
I have to leave.

02:28.774 --> 02:29.900
Where's Jericho?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.070
I don't know.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.615
Well, you'll stay here till you remember.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.588
What if she needs the toilet?

02:53.549 --> 02:55.300
I left a bucket and a roll of tissue.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.135
We have three and a half bathrooms.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.096
I need you to be on board with this.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.390
It will only work if we're united.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.308
-And what if she doesn't talk?
-She will.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.896
Remember that heartbreaking piece
I filmed in 2015 on drug rehabilitation?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.357
You isolate the addict.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.610
Remove all temptation.
You have to be firm and consistent.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.862
And once they surrender

03:14.945 --> 03:16.738
and they admit
they don't know what's best,

03:16.822 --> 03:18.991
that's when you know
they're on the road to recovery.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.158
She's not a junkie.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.579
Heroin, religion, it's all the same beast.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.792
Leanne has been under the influence
of a cult for the majority of her life.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.335
She's loyal to them.

03:31.837 --> 03:35.465
We have to break that bond before she'll
tell us where they're keeping Jericho.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.134
It's that simple?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.722
Under no circumstance
must you go up there without me.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.933
She will manipulate you.
You're not as strong as you like to think.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.571
Call me if anything develops.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.909
Look, honey, the builders are here.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.620
See? We're fixing everything.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.372
-Guys.
-Morning.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.251
How you doing?

05:25.450 --> 05:27.411
Appropriating a baby was one thing,

05:27.494 --> 05:30.205
but imprisoning an 18-year-old girl
you've abducted in your attic

05:30.289 --> 05:32.374
is a whole new level of skullfuckery.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.667
She's not a prisoner.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.004
Oh, no? What is the correct legalese
for this scenario?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.967
I was wondering how
this could be more relaxing. Thank you.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.928
It's my fucking hand.
I keep forgetting about it.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.183
You don't feel this at all?

05:49.266 --> 05:51.393
Nothing. It's like it's not even there.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.521
You should see a doctor.
It sounds like you got a brain clot.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.064
Why would it be a brain cl--

05:56.148 --> 05:58.025
Has she said anything yet?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.985
Little Anne Frank up yonder.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.195
I can't get to her.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.157
She could be telling Dorothy anything.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.076
You think I don't fucking know that?

06:09.119 --> 06:11.622
If I could just talk to her,
if I could just reason with her,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.415
maybe she'll tell me where he is.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.752
Or she's gonna lead Dorothy
straight into the arms of Aunt Cuckoo.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.795
She's not gonna help Dorothy.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.006
You heard what she said about her to Tobe.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.929
Peter Pan always said the
key to flying is "Think happy thoughts."

06:27.012 --> 06:29.640
But I had to go down to
the King of Prussia wind tunnel

06:29.723 --> 06:32.142
to really defy gravity.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.235
I had to go to three
different stores to find the tomato.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.779
Someone must be buying in bulk
for the winter.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.658
I see you're making yourself at home.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.704
These clothes are not for dress-up.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.876
The family I was stationed with,
the mother's very sick.

07:39.710 --> 07:44.089
The little boy, Sergio,
their family, they need me.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.133
I feel sorry for them.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.594
I made a commitment to them.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.389
Yes, you also made a commitment to us.
You signed a contract.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.934
I can't give Jericho to you.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.272
Then you'll tell me where he is.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.325
Maybe you'll feel differently tomorrow.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.746
One day at a time.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.423
She was quite petulant tonight.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.009
She never used to be like that.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.054
In fairness, we didn't have her locked up,
pissing in a bucket before.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.181
It's because she's
away from their influence.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.559
She doesn't know how to think for herself.
She's been brainwashed.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.232
Maybe we could bring her down in
the evening if we keep a close eye on her.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.150
I have asked,

08:45.234 --> 08:48.487
and she has repeatedly refused
to tell me where Jericho is.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.405
I just think--

08:50.489 --> 08:53.825
We are so close to getting him home,
and you want her to get her steps in.

08:54.910 --> 08:59.957
Will you please, just this once, trust me
to handle this in the correct way?

09:50.215 --> 09:52.759
You need to bring him back.

09:52.843 --> 09:53.969
I told you.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.763
Why won't you do it?

09:58.515 --> 10:01.101
Mrs. Turner. Stop.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.687
Stop.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.772
I need him back!

10:07.399 --> 10:08.984
God, you're hurting me!

10:19.661 --> 10:22.039
I think I threw my back out
flying yesterday.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.626
-You were five feet off the ground.
-It's the same muscles.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.920
Maybe I should take her breakfast up.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.422
We have a strategy.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.509
She might say something to me
that she wouldn't say to you.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.011
Why would she trust you and not me?

10:36.094 --> 10:37.846
I don't know. Sometimes you can be a--

10:41.975 --> 10:43.060
I can be what?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.812
Just let me see
if I can get through to her.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.027
One egg.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.534
You'd spoil her if I'd let you.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.995
-Just tell my car to wait, please.
-Sure.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.455
Breakfast?

11:04.373 --> 11:07.084
My mother used to make us
start every day with an egg.

11:10.546 --> 11:13.590
Be gentle with these decorations.
They've been here forever.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.511
I'm surprised they even work.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.102
Did you have a breakfast routine
growing up, Leanne?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.731
We had every meal together.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.025
No matter what had happened that day,

11:32.109 --> 11:35.153
we would all come together
and share our stories.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.578
Where's Jericho?

11:45.622 --> 11:47.332
I wanna talk to Mr. Turner.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.377
Whatever you can say to him,
you can say to me.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.302
Very well.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.183
You won't come between us.

12:04.266 --> 12:07.102
Sean and I are a family.
Something you've clearly never had.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.001
Hello, Leanne.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.924
You found Angela.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.178
I call her Mrs. Barrington.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.434
She was in our bedroom for a while,
when we had the apartment at Rittenhouse.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.688
She wore scarves mostly.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.735
I didn't know she was going to do that.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.613
Bring you here in that way.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.033
Why haven't you told her?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.371
It has to be one of you.

13:50.414 --> 13:51.790
You don't know Dorothy.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.294
You don't know what it would do to her.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.379
She deserves whatever's coming her way.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.967
If anyone wants to punish her, they can.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.430
Because it cannot compare
to what she would do to herself.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.935
You want to help us, Leanne.
I know you do.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.565
In return, let me help you.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.026
Just tell me where he is.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.030
And I'll give you anything you want.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.825
I want to use the bathroom.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.566
What happened to your hand?

15:00.442 --> 15:01.735
It was an accident.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.530
Does it hurt?

15:06.990 --> 15:07.991
Agony.

15:34.059 --> 15:38.230
The fight broke out earlier
at this Germantown chicken joint.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.940
When staff made the announcement

15:40.023 --> 15:43.986
that their chicken sandwiches
would be rationed to two per customer,

15:44.069 --> 15:45.737
the scene turned ugly.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.744
Shit. Yeah, baby. Yeah!

15:52.828 --> 15:53.829
Get him, baby!

15:53.912 --> 15:55.581
-Come here!
-What are you doing?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.124
That's not yours.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.293
Hit him!

15:59.376 --> 16:00.711
Hit him!

16:21.773 --> 16:23.025
Where is he?

16:23.609 --> 16:26.195
-Where is he?
-No!

16:31.575 --> 16:33.076
You took him away from me!

16:34.328 --> 16:35.913
You tell me where he is!

17:21.750 --> 17:23.001
You sleep okay?

17:25.963 --> 17:28.006
I get panicky at 2:00 a.m.

17:30.133 --> 17:34.137
It's like my body seems to be remembering
something my mind forgot.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.768
So strange it's always 2:00,
don't you think?

17:41.645 --> 17:43.856
I feel like it's about Jericho.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.277
Maybe we should talk to Natalie,
get her to prescribe you something.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.654
Yeah.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.699
You'd like that. Turn me into a zombie.

17:55.701 --> 17:56.952
That's not what I said.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.247
Sorry, darling.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.626
I'm just tired.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.511
How did we sleep?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.892
I used to pray for you, Dorothy.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.604
Not anymore.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.485
Well, that's good, because we no longer
allow superstition in this house.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.161
You can make this stop, Leanne,
anytime you like!

19:05.103 --> 19:06.271
Century eggs.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.983
They soak them in tea.
That's what gives them the color.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.906
We didn't start trying
till we were in our mid-30s.

19:16.949 --> 19:20.410
It would have been career suicide for her
to do it any earlier.

19:20.494 --> 19:25.374
That's why she blames herself for all
that's happened. We'd almost given up.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.126
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.629
It's because you want me
to feel sorry for her.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.297
Or understand her a bit better.

19:32.381 --> 19:35.843
The truth is, I'll tell you whatever
you wanna hear if we can get him back.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.971
Who?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.057
Don't play games.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.434
I know you're a good person.
I know what you did for us.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.062
Tell me who you're looking for.

19:49.940 --> 19:50.941
Jericho.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.569
We want Jericho back.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.740
Jericho died, Mr. Turner.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.173
Julian's secret blend of herbs and spices.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.009
As long as it's not weed.
I don't need Dorothy high.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.220
When did she start on the bourbon again?

20:20.304 --> 20:21.513
She has one a night.

20:21.597 --> 20:25.184
I hate those people. It's a level
of self-control I can't abide.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.443
We can't let this go on
much longer. She's terrified up there.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.111
You got in to see her?

20:36.612 --> 20:37.988
But she's not saying anything.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.073
And she won't.
Not as long as she's a prisoner.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.284
We're not the bad guys here.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.703
No? What are we?

20:45.162 --> 20:47.289
We're the victims. Isn't that obvious?

20:54.505 --> 20:56.381
"May the Lord judge between me and you.

20:56.465 --> 20:59.510
May the Lord avenge me upon you,
but my hand shall not be against you.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.721
As the proverb of the ancients says,
'Out of the wicked comes wickedness,'

21:02.804 --> 21:04.473
but my hand shall not be against you.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.600
Afterward David also arose
and went out of the cave

21:06.683 --> 21:08.393
and called after Saul, 'My lord the king!'

21:08.477 --> 21:10.771
When Saul looked behind him,
David bowed with his face to the earth,

21:10.854 --> 21:12.105
and did obeisance.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.483
And David said to Saul, 'Why do you
listen to the words of men who say,

21:14.566 --> 21:15.692
"Behold, David seeks to do you harm"?'"

21:16.944 --> 21:19.321
Of course it's the children
that you have to cry for.

21:19.404 --> 21:23.075
I mean, if an adult wants to sign away
their free will to a religious scam,

21:23.158 --> 21:24.201
then good luck to them,

21:24.284 --> 21:28.872
but a child's mind is so delicate, so--

21:28.956 --> 21:33.126
What's the word for something
that takes everything else in?

21:33.210 --> 21:34.211
Porous.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.340
It'll come to me.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.051
It's definitely porous.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.595
What if I go up there and play bad cop?

21:43.679 --> 21:44.763
No, no.

21:44.847 --> 21:49.309
That's very sweet of you, but no.
I've got Leanne right where I want her.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.689
First rule of journalism,
you ask a simple question

21:53.772 --> 21:56.441
and then you keep repeating it
until you get your answer.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.696
But just promise me that when we find him,

22:00.779 --> 22:02.447
you'll leave negotiations to me.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.659
I'm very good
at keeping emotion out of things.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.662
I won't get on my knees, like some of us.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.625
-What's this?
-Nothing.

22:14.543 --> 22:15.627
He didn't tell you?

22:18.255 --> 22:21.049
The uncle confronted him
in the cellar at the baptism.

22:21.592 --> 22:22.926
Forced him to pray.

22:24.178 --> 22:25.179
Pray?

22:26.972 --> 22:28.015
Pray for what?

22:28.098 --> 22:29.516
I don't remember.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.393
Did you put Scotch bonnets in this?

22:32.436 --> 22:33.437
Nice try.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.773
But this recipe
will go with me to the grave.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.066
No, it's something.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.115
Naga Viper.
And you mixed it with peperoncini.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.992
That's how you get the sweetness
with the kick.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.620
Pasta's overcooked,
but anyone can tell that.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.080
You guessed.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.499
Darling.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.211
You can taste.

24:15.998 --> 24:19.710
Turmeric. For your under-eye circles.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.171
What under-eye circles?

24:28.010 --> 24:30.554
-Any day now, she's talking.
-You think?

24:31.722 --> 24:33.348
We're deprogramming her.

24:33.432 --> 24:34.975
As long as that's all we're doing.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.314
What are you suggesting?

24:42.274 --> 24:44.693
I just wanna be sure
we're not crossing any lines.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.699
-Have you been up there?
-Of course I haven't.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.007
I love charcuterie.

25:07.090 --> 25:10.636
It's got everything. Salt, bitter, umami.

25:13.180 --> 25:14.765
Must be a relief to taste again.

25:15.390 --> 25:16.892
Came back just like that.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.355
If Dorothy sees you have that...

25:23.815 --> 25:24.816
She'll what?

25:27.819 --> 25:29.655
Let me do something for you, Leanne.

25:30.781 --> 25:33.242
If I take you back to your family,
would you like that?

25:40.332 --> 25:41.750
I can't tell you where he is.

25:41.834 --> 25:42.835
You don't have to.

25:43.627 --> 25:45.087
You could just bring him home.

25:45.754 --> 25:48.090
-I know you can.
-Sean?

25:48.966 --> 25:50.217
I'm home.

25:51.552 --> 25:54.179
Better not let her
find you in here, Mr. Turner.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.029
Where is he?

28:19.366 --> 28:20.826
He's in a better place.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.954
Surrounded by people that love him.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.334
We keep him warm, and we keep him happy.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.837
And we keep him safe.

28:33.255 --> 28:34.590
Safe from you.

28:52.482 --> 28:53.859
Gee...

29:00.240 --> 29:02.201
I'm burning. Dorothy!

29:02.826 --> 29:04.077
Dorothy!

29:05.037 --> 29:06.038
Shit.

29:06.872 --> 29:07.873
Dor--

29:36.985 --> 29:37.986
Dorothy?

29:50.415 --> 29:51.792
Where is she?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.153
What did you do with--

31:04.239 --> 31:05.574
What did you do?

31:07.242 --> 31:08.744
She wouldn't tell me.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.455
This is too far.

31:15.209 --> 31:17.252
Nothing is too far.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.713
Dorothy.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.632
Dorothy.

31:35.729 --> 31:38.607
It's okay. It's okay.

31:39.733 --> 31:40.984
It's okay.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.446
It's okay.

31:59.336 --> 32:00.671
Do you want any help?

32:00.754 --> 32:01.839
I can manage.

32:06.218 --> 32:11.390
She's not a bad person.
She just loves him that much.

32:13.809 --> 32:15.644
You can feel it again, can't you?

32:16.895 --> 32:17.896
Your hand.

32:19.481 --> 32:21.441
And that's why you woke up and found me?
