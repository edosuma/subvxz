# Who's that I see
walking in these woods?

00:11.155 --> 00:14.409
# Why, it's Little Red Riding hood

00:14.492 --> 00:17.662
# Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood

00:17.745 --> 00:20.163
# You sure are looking good

00:20.205 --> 00:24.502

that a big bad wolf would want

00:24.585 --> 00:27.046
<i>Listen to me.</i>

00:27.755 --> 00:30.216
# Little Red Riding Hood

00:30.633 --> 00:32.927
# I don't think even big girls should

00:33.010 --> 00:37.057
# Go walking
in these spooky old woods alone

00:40.436 --> 00:43.020
# What big eyes you have

00:45.522 --> 00:46.566
You're obsessed with him,

00:46.649 --> 00:48.776
I'm not obsessed,
I'm just highly interested.

00:49.193 --> 00:50.696
Come on, Let's settle this.

00:50.737 --> 00:52.656
Girls, please, sit, sit.

00:52.738 --> 00:54.158
Let Zela read your palms.

Oh, no. Forget it. This is stupid.

00:55.742 --> 00:57.910
so are you. sit down.

00:59.162 --> 01:01.205
OK, Zela, this is it.

01:01.622 --> 01:04.917
My friend here is basically obsessed
with this guy that won't call her back

01:04.959 --> 01:09.547
and we need to know if she should forget
him cold or hold out for the next 20 years.

01:10.006 --> 01:14.428
Well, anyways, whatever you see,
just say 'Forget his ass'.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.430
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need you to read my friend's.

01:18.890 --> 01:20.683
Blood.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.561
- Excuse me?
- I see blood.

01:24.187 --> 01:26.773
so much blood.

01:27.190 --> 01:29.399
OK, that's nice, but...

01:30.652 --> 01:32.153
You too.

01:32.236 --> 01:34.406
You're both in danger.

01:35.406 --> 01:38.367
Need to know?
No, Back to the guy.

01:38.451 --> 01:41.078
It's not the guy.

01:41.622 --> 01:44.791
It's... it's the beast you should fear.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.167
OK.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.128
We're done here.

01:48.212 --> 01:51.881
- Come on, Becky. Let's go.
- Beware the moon.

01:51.923 --> 01:54.091
It feeds in the moonlight.

03:54.504 --> 03:57.632
- You should really wear a cup.
- Stop it, Bo, OK?

03:57.715 --> 04:01.887
I'm just looking out for him, He can't help it,
Every school's got one, the derogatory 'it,'

04:01.929 --> 04:04.388
A geek on his way to fag town.

04:04.430 --> 04:06.641
- Look, I'm not gay.
- Bummer.

04:06.724 --> 04:09.810
You mean you're just
an ass wimp-wad for no reason?

04:09.893 --> 04:12.897
- Yep.
- That sucks.

04:12.980 --> 04:15.108
- Boo!
- Whoa!

04:15.191 --> 04:17.777
You're such a dick, Bo.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.863
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

04:20.946 --> 04:24.075
I think your dog is gay too.

04:24.951 --> 04:29.914
What's with the Make-A-Wish
charity case, Brooke?

04:40.757 --> 04:42.760

04:46.556 --> 04:47.516
- Hi, Jimmy.
- I'm waiting.

04:47.599 --> 04:50.183
Yeah, I know, I stopped by Tinsel
on my way, to see Jake.

04:50.267 --> 04:51.936
- But I'm your brother.
- I'll be there soon.

04:52.019 --> 04:54.313
- Well, how soon?
- I said soon, OK?

04:54.397 --> 04:55.606
- Do you know what can happen to me?
- Yes.

04:55.690 --> 04:58.151
I know what can happen
to a teenager on Hollywood Boulevard.

04:58.234 --> 04:59.695
- Do you?
- OK, Quit whining.

04:59.778 --> 05:00.987
- Fine.
- Yeah. Bye.

05:03.322 --> 05:05.408
Perfect.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.251
- Excellent, Excellent!
- Cool.

05:15.334 --> 05:18.212
50 grand well-spent.

05:18.296 --> 05:22.216
- OK, Looking good up there now.
- You got it.

05:24.342 --> 05:25.929
- Ellie.
- Hi.

05:26.013 --> 05:27.972
Hi.

05:29.348 --> 05:32.184
- How's it going?
- We're not even close to finished.

05:32.268 --> 05:37.273
I got four days work and the opening's
in two, I am drowning in stress.

05:37.315 --> 05:39.943
Kiss me again.

05:39.985 --> 05:41.819
What are you doing here?

05:41.903 --> 05:44.696
- That's good, I told you, That's good.
- I haven't seen you in days.

05:44.780 --> 05:47.950
I wanted to make sure you were still alive.
What is this?

05:48.033 --> 05:50.244
It's a medieval torture device.

05:50.328 --> 05:53.248
Which could actually be fun later.

05:53.290 --> 05:56.000
Come on,
I'll give you the two-second tour.

05:56.042 --> 05:58.544
Spanish lnquisition,

05:58.628 --> 06:01.255
Frankenstein's laboratory,

06:01.339 --> 06:03.341
Dracula’s coffin,

06:04.801 --> 06:06.969
What's that?

06:07.053 --> 06:08.721
Oh, that.

06:08.805 --> 06:13.725
That is a sterling replica to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of the Wolf Man.

06:13.810 --> 06:16.354
It was donated by the Chaney estate.

06:16.437 --> 06:17.688
Wow.

06:17.772 --> 06:20.233
Planet Hollywood
has nothing on you guys.

06:20.316 --> 06:23.194
Shh, we don't mention them here.

06:24.569 --> 06:26.696
so, I was thinking,

06:26.738 --> 06:29.450
I'll be here for the opening,
and you'll be here.

06:29.534 --> 06:32.161
So how about we be here together?

06:32.245 --> 06:34.998
If I was actually going to the opening.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.459
What do you mean? You have to go.
It's your big night. You have to show off.

06:39.501 --> 06:42.130
All I wanna do is crawl into bed
and disappear for three days.

06:42.171 --> 06:44.173
Well, even better.

06:44.215 --> 06:46.717
I'll crawl in too.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.014
Excuse me,
I need a signature on this.

06:53.098 --> 06:56.018
Damn. Can you hold on for one second?

06:59.063 --> 07:01.357
- Right there.
- Thanks.

07:01.399 --> 07:03.526
Yeah.

07:03.609 --> 07:06.028
Jake?

07:07.112 --> 07:09.323
Is there something wrong?

07:10.198 --> 07:14.620
No. There's nothing wrong. I'm just
stressed out with work and this madness.

07:14.704 --> 07:18.292
I just... I need some time
and some space.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.209
OK.

07:22.420 --> 07:27.091
Just call me, when you feel like it,
you know. No pressure.

07:47.528 --> 07:50.072
I waited over an hour for you.

07:50.156 --> 07:53.034
I'm sorry, OK?

07:53.117 --> 07:55.703
- Do you want to drop it?
- For over an hour, I waited.

07:55.787 --> 07:58.791
Yeah, well, most teenagers
have friends who give them a lift home.

07:58.874 --> 08:02.000
- But then I couldn't inconvenience you.
- Not tonight, Jimmy, Can we just not fight?

08:03.503 --> 08:05.505
Watch out!

08:29.152 --> 08:32.072
- Are you OK?
- Yeah,

08:32.155 --> 08:33.825
Zipper.

08:35.493 --> 08:40.289
It's OK, boy.

08:59.641 --> 09:02.103
- Hello?
- Oh, God, Help me, Please!

09:02.187 --> 09:04.021
I'm coming.

09:05.482 --> 09:07.693
Help me, please!

09:07.776 --> 09:10.903
I'm coming.
I'm trying to get to you.

09:14.699 --> 09:19.537
- Are you OK?
- Please just get me out of here, I'm stuck.

09:19.663 --> 09:20.705
OK. OK.

09:22.874 --> 09:25.960
- Help me, God.
- Can you feel your legs?

09:26.378 --> 09:30.380
- I think so, The dashboard's just caved in.
- OK.

09:33.010 --> 09:37.053
- Do you have a jack?
- Uh, yeah, Yeah, It's in the trunk.

09:37.138 --> 09:40.141
All right, I'm gonna try to go get it, OK?
I'll be right back.

09:40.224 --> 09:43.186
OK, Hurry, please!

09:47.398 --> 09:50.318
Oh, God.

09:50.401 --> 09:54.237
Hello? Hello? No, no, I can't hear you.

09:54.279 --> 09:56.199
Shit, AT&&T...

09:56.240 --> 09:59.535
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, stop! stop!

10:02.289 --> 10:06.292
- Jesus, people, what's wrong with you?
- 911 emergency. Hello? Hello?

10:06.375 --> 10:09.337
- Hello? Wait, wait, can you hear me now?
- 911 emergency. Yes, I can, sir.

10:09.378 --> 10:11.005
- All right, listen, there's been a wreck.
- Where, sir?

10:11.088 --> 10:13.926
I'm on Mulholland Drive,
just east of Coldwater.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.861
- Jesus.
- Hey, calm down, It's just me.

10:33.945 --> 10:35.696
- I called for help.
- Oh, good.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.074
What's going on out there?

10:38.157 --> 10:40.243
I couldn't get the trunk open.

10:40.326 --> 10:43.996
but help's on the way, OK?
Just hold on a few more minutes.

10:44.038 --> 10:47.291
- Do you hear that?
- What?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.418
I hear dripping, like leaking.

10:49.502 --> 10:52.713
Do you smell gas? I smell gas.
Oh, God, The car's gonna blow up.

10:52.797 --> 10:56.425
- No, no, no, The car is not gonna blow up.
- Uh, actually it could.

10:56.509 --> 10:59.970
- Jesus Christ, get me the fuck out of here!
- OK, all right, all right.

11:00.053 --> 11:02.389
Let me try.

11:04.517 --> 11:07.019
- If I could get up, underneath...
- Just do it!

11:07.061 --> 11:09.230
OK, OK. All right.

11:09.313 --> 11:13.108
- Wait, All right, I think I'm getting it.
- Oh, God. Please, please.

11:13.191 --> 11:15.194
Wait,
can you be still for a second?

11:15.278 --> 11:19.449
You try flipping your car down a mountain
and then being fucking still.

11:20.783 --> 11:23.578
Maybe you guys should hurry up.

11:23.661 --> 11:25.455
- All right. Calm down.
- I am calm!

11:25.496 --> 11:28.207
I think I'm getting it.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.168
All right. OK.

11:30.877 --> 11:32.920
- OK, I got it.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

11:33.004 --> 11:40.507
Oh, help me with the seat belt.

11:42.597 --> 11:44.599
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

11:44.682 --> 11:48.227
My legs... There's help. They hurt.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.564
The police are coming.

11:51.648 --> 11:53.858
Yeah, well.
I hope you guys have insurance.

11:53.941 --> 11:57.111
What? No, no, it was an accident. We hit
an animal, or it hit us. I'm not even sure.

11:57.153 --> 12:00.239
- It wasn't a dog, was it?
- Actually, it was...

12:04.368 --> 12:06.871
Ellie! Hold on to me.

12:16.047 --> 12:17.715
Jimmy!

12:21.806 --> 12:26.516
No! Jimmy!

12:29.602 --> 12:31.562
Ellie.

12:33.147 --> 12:35.608
Go! Go!

12:35.640 --> 12:37.778
- Do you think she...?
- No, No, go, Go, go, go,

12:50.790 --> 12:53.126
Oh, Jimmy.

12:53.666 --> 12:55.586
Shit, look at your arm.

12:57.964 --> 13:00.133
The police.

13:03.052 --> 13:08.600
- They're ready for us now.
- They said it was pretty nasty.

13:09.559 --> 13:14.396
Let me get this straight. It took a bite
out of your arm, but you didn't see it at all?

13:14.438 --> 13:17.608
Well, it all happened so fast
and it was dark.

13:17.650 --> 13:22.321
Well, I saw it, It was a wolf, but bigger.
It was like a monster wolf.

13:22.406 --> 13:24.700
Yeah, Jimmy,
I have your statement already.

13:24.783 --> 13:27.368
Fine, don't believe me.
I know what I saw.

13:27.410 --> 13:30.121
What happened to her...

13:30.204 --> 13:32.873
What kind of an animal could do that?

13:32.956 --> 13:35.042
A mountain lion, a bear, maybe.

13:35.586 --> 13:40.423
There hasn't been a wolf sighting
in southern California in over 70 years.

13:40.506 --> 13:43.008
- Mountain lion, my ass.
- Jimmy.

13:43.091 --> 13:45.428
Please.

13:45.470 --> 13:48.306
Why don't you go check on Zipper?

13:50.725 --> 13:53.895
Don't worry.
Whatever it was, we'll find it.

13:56.105 --> 13:58.356
Hey, buddy, are you OK?

13:58.441 --> 14:00.317
Zipper?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.779
What's wrong?

14:02.863 --> 14:04.947
Hey, smell, It's just me.

14:05.032 --> 14:07.700
Hey! Hey, look what you did.

14:10.119 --> 14:12.872
That's enough with the biting.

14:16.210 --> 14:18.461
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:19.463 --> 14:24.549
- Hey, you guys be safe.
- All right, come on. Let's go.

14:37.396 --> 14:40.817
Hey, Zipper. Come on in.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.736
Hey, Zipper, come on in.

14:48.157 --> 14:50.159
Freak.

14:52.245 --> 14:54.704
- Well, good night.
- Hey.

14:55.832 --> 14:57.250
What?

14:57.291 --> 14:59.293
Don't you wanna talk
about what happened tonight?

14:59.377 --> 15:02.755
- What's there to talk about?
- Jimmy, we were attacked.

15:02.797 --> 15:04.423
We saw a girl get torn apart.

15:04.507 --> 15:08.343
You wanna talk about the bear
or the mountain lion?

15:08.385 --> 15:12.223
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but I didn't see what you saw.

15:12.265 --> 15:15.977
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what else to say.

15:16.061 --> 15:19.730
OK, well, uh, thanks for the talk.
Good night.

15:19.814 --> 15:21.775
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

15:21.941 --> 15:24.569
I'm trying here.

16:59.622 --> 17:01.165
'Unsolved...'

17:02.458 --> 17:03.960
OK.

17:07.463 --> 17:09.882
Jesus, '1600 animal attacks...'

17:10.133 --> 17:12.718
'...large wolf-like animals...'

17:15.887 --> 17:18.099
Oh, my God.

19:34.486 --> 19:39.239
- Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

19:39.281 --> 19:41.367
I just... I needed to talk to you.

19:41.409 --> 19:45.413
I found the extra key under the mat.
I'm really sorry.

19:45.496 --> 19:48.333
I just, I feel so terrible
about how we left things tonight.

19:48.417 --> 19:53.296
- Jake, what's going on?
- I'm just scared, Ellie.

19:53.378 --> 19:55.547
I'm scared.

19:56.424 --> 19:59.969
I never expected
to meet a woman like you.

20:01.012 --> 20:06.433
Jake, you're the only good thing
that's happened in my life in a long time.

20:06.475 --> 20:08.853
I'm scared too.

20:08.936 --> 20:11.063
I'm terrified,

20:11.105 --> 20:14.985
because all the good things
keep going away.

20:17.569 --> 20:20.490
I'm not going anywhere.

21:29.016 --> 21:32.770
<i>Here in Los Angeles,
a young woman was attacked and killed</i>

21:32.854 --> 21:35.148
<i>by an unidentified wild animal</i>

21:35.231 --> 21:39.193
<i>when her car ran off the road last night,
high in the Hollywood hills.</i>

21:39.277 --> 21:41.695
<i>the victim's name has yet to be released.</i>

21:41.736 --> 21:46.242
<i>It happened on a remote stretch of
Mulholland Drive, shortly before midnight.</i>

21:46.284 --> 21:49.746
<i>Animal control officers speculate
that it might have been a bear</i>

21:49.830 --> 21:52.748
<i>that wandered into the area
in search of water.</i>

21:52.832 --> 21:56.168
<i>It is the first such fatal attack
in Los Angeles...</i>

22:18.275 --> 22:22.528
- Hey.
- How are you doing? Did you sleep OK?

22:22.570 --> 22:24.947
I woke up in the bushes.

22:24.989 --> 22:27.366
You woke up where?

22:27.450 --> 22:29.827
Are you feeling OK?
I'm calling Dr, Steinberg.

22:29.869 --> 22:33.831
No, no, I'm fine. Really.
Actually... I feel kinda great.

22:34.289 --> 22:36.082
OK.

22:37.043 --> 22:41.214
But I'm gonna make an appointment. They
said we should follow up with another shot.

22:41.297 --> 22:44.510
For all we know,
that wolf could've had rabies.

22:44.551 --> 22:45.969
Oh. Oh, so now it's a wolf.

22:46.053 --> 22:48.805
Jimmy, I never said it wasn't.
I just said I didn't see it.

22:48.888 --> 22:50.764
It was more like a werewolf.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.184
And I found this website last night
and according to legend.

22:53.226 --> 22:56.145
a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle -
that's the three nights around the full moon.

22:56.229 --> 22:58.147
Last night was the first moon
of the lunar cycle.

22:58.189 --> 23:00.943
Why can't you just download porn
like other teenage boys?

23:01.400 --> 23:05.028
Excuse me for trying
to make conversation.

23:05.113 --> 23:07.740
OK, so what would a werewolf
be doing in LA?

23:07.824 --> 23:11.202
shouldn't it be off in the countryside
somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?

23:11.285 --> 23:17.250
Maybe it's a hip werewolf, Maidens come
here with the perfectly implanted breasts.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.044
- You should get to school,
- Hey, I was bitten by a werewolf.

23:20.128 --> 23:22.798
If that's not good enough for a sick day...
I could be cursed.

23:22.881 --> 23:25.216
Everybody's cursed, Jimmy.
It's called life.

23:25.258 --> 23:27.135
No, I mean by the mark of the beast.

23:27.218 --> 23:31.096
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

23:44.777 --> 23:46.279
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

23:52.118 --> 23:54.829
- Whoa, Hey, Ellie.
- Hey, Kyle.

23:54.912 --> 23:58.498
Hey, '70s retro week is booking up, Do we
want Keith Partridge or Marcia Brady?

23:58.582 --> 24:00.376
- Only one slot left.
- Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

24:00.460 --> 24:04.046
You look different today,
saucy, I like it.

24:04.131 --> 24:07.300
- Yeah, it's new, Gauze look.
- Nice, What happened?

24:07.384 --> 24:11.137
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- Hey, are you OK?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.681
Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.434
Incoming psycho publicist, one o'clock.

24:16.517 --> 24:19.979
...no trades, Oh, I have to go.
Yeah, OK, Goodbye.

24:21.106 --> 24:22.648
Hi,

24:22.733 --> 24:25.317
I didn't recognize you
with your hair down.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.781
I just wanted to drop by to make sure we
were set for Scott’s pre-interview tonight.

24:29.864 --> 24:34.076
- Absolutely, Nine o'clock.
- Great, Is that what you're gonna wear?

24:34.160 --> 24:37.704
Hey, I heard that you're dating
Jake Taylor, Is that true?

24:37.788 --> 24:40.792
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- Why not?

24:40.875 --> 24:42.960
I guess it was only a matter of time
before he got to you.

24:43.044 --> 24:46.631
- He always did prefer the vulnerable ones.
- OK, well, I'll see you tonight, Joannie.

24:46.714 --> 24:49.759
I'm only saying this because I care.

24:49.842 --> 24:52.303
Is there anything else, Joannie?

24:52.345 --> 24:54.764
No, Tonight, Don't be late.

24:54.847 --> 24:57.600
- OK, Thank you.
- OK.

24:58.977 --> 25:01.646
Putting on weight, Kyle?

25:03.773 --> 25:06.942
- What a piece of work.
- I do not like that woman.

25:07.025 --> 25:11.864
- No, Apparently Jake didn't either.
- I didn't even know that she knew him.

25:11.907 --> 25:15.410
- Do you think she's right about him?
- No, The woman's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

25:15.494 --> 25:21.249
But I'm not the one dating him.
I just know he's not the only guy in town.

25:27.045 --> 25:29.298
What smells so good?

25:29.383 --> 25:32.551
I... I don't smell anything.

25:59.370 --> 26:01.455
I get these.

26:01.538 --> 26:04.459
It's nothing, I'll live.

26:05.668 --> 26:07.753
The blood freaking you out?

26:17.639 --> 26:20.433
- Hey, Brooke, you need some change?
- Hey, Jimmy.

26:20.851 --> 26:23.311
That'd be great.
Stupid thing won't take my dollar.

26:24.372 --> 26:27.105
- I'll hold those.
- Thanks.

26:28.107 --> 26:30.151
Werewolves, huh?

26:30.234 --> 26:33.613
Oh, it's just a stupid report I'm doing.

26:33.696 --> 26:36.157
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

26:36.282 --> 26:39.453
No, keep your money.
It's on me, Thanks.

26:39.536 --> 26:41.788
Geek juice.

26:41.871 --> 26:46.375
- Trying out for the wrestling team, Jimmy?
- Oh, no, I don't wrestle.

26:46.417 --> 26:51.255
Oh, I'd think all that male-to-male contact
would be right up your alley.

26:53.341 --> 26:56.886
Is, uh... Is that the appeal for you?

26:56.969 --> 26:58.721
Oh, Back talk.

26:58.805 --> 27:01.266
Haven't you been team captain
for, like, two years now?

27:01.350 --> 27:03.017
Nicely done, Jimmy.

27:03.476 --> 27:06.646
Did you just attempt a confrontation?

27:07.897 --> 27:10.899
- Yeah, maybe.
- Let me know when you're sure.

27:12.651 --> 27:15.614
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

27:16.823 --> 27:20.201
Let's get out of here
before we get homo-stained.

27:20.701 --> 27:22.870
Hey, Hey.

27:26.292 --> 27:29.284
(# ''freaks come Out At Night''
by Whodini)

27:30.296 --> 27:32.287
# Now the party's jumping,
the place is packed

27:32.365 --> 27:34.595
# But when the crowd's like this
I'm ready to rap

27:34.667 --> 27:36.760
# But before I could
bust a thyme on the mic

27:36.836 --> 27:39.270
# freaks are all over me
like white on rice

27:39.338 --> 27:41.033
# freaks come in all shapes
and sizes and colors

27:41.107 --> 27:43.541
# But what I like about them most
is that they're real good lovers

27:43.609 --> 27:45.634
# they do it in the park,
they do it in the dark

27:45.712 --> 27:47.409
# But most freaks are known
for breaking hearts

27:47.437 --> 27:49.271
Joannie.

27:49.522 --> 27:52.525
- Joannie.
- There you are.

27:52.567 --> 27:55.069
What is this? Come as
your favorite endangered species?

27:55.153 --> 27:56.863
Obnoxious, isn't it?

27:56.946 --> 27:59.658
I just feel a little underdressed
without a tail.

27:59.741 --> 28:05.746
Well, that's part of your charm,
Take this, I will tell Scott that you're here.

28:06.832 --> 28:09.041
Well, I think you look fantastic.

28:10.586 --> 28:13.171
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see you.

28:13.254 --> 28:17.632
What about the opening?
Disappearing for a few days.

28:19.093 --> 28:23.014
- That didn't go over so well, did it?
- You know what? It's fine.

28:23.055 --> 28:26.267
We've only been seeing each other
a couple of months, you need your space.

28:26.350 --> 28:29.021
I get it, It's fine.

28:29.061 --> 28:34.066
Please don't do that. Don't try
to make everything OK when it's not.

28:34.108 --> 28:37.488
Can I talk to you in private for a second?

28:43.326 --> 28:45.035
Ellie.

28:46.036 --> 28:51.584
That was my MO for a long time. When
anything would get too close or too serious.

28:51.626 --> 28:53.795
I would just run away.

28:53.879 --> 28:56.048
For...

28:56.131 --> 29:00.009
For a variety of reasons
that I can't even begin to go into.

29:00.092 --> 29:05.307
I don't want to do that with us. This thing,
you and me, this is special, Ellie.

29:05.389 --> 29:07.725
and I just don't want to lose you,

29:07.767 --> 29:10.561
so I was hoping that, maybe,

29:10.645 --> 29:14.607
you could just bear with me
for a little while longer.

29:14.690 --> 29:19.153
I guess I'm learning about these things
as we go along.

29:20.279 --> 29:26.159
Well, maybe I'll finish up here
and we can go someplace to talk.

29:26.243 --> 29:29.081
OK. Thank you, Ellie.

29:29.123 --> 29:31.833
Well, hi, there, Remember me?

29:31.916 --> 29:32.958
Uh...

29:32.999 --> 29:35.879
- Jenny Tate, Becky Morton's friend.
- Right. Of course, Jenny.

29:35.963 --> 29:37.964
- It's good to see you again, I was actually...
- Jake.

29:38.047 --> 29:39.714
- Hi.
- Hi. Long time no see.

29:39.757 --> 29:43.885
Sorry to interrupt an awkward moment,
but we're ready for you.

29:43.969 --> 29:45.847
I have to go.

29:47.306 --> 29:49.768
- Ellie.
- I'm working.

29:49.851 --> 29:54.105
So, Becky cannot stop talking about you.

29:54.188 --> 29:56.566
She's gonna die
when she finds out you were here.

29:56.607 --> 29:58.067
Excuse me, I have to go.

29:58.109 --> 30:04.574
I know it was only a couple of dates, but
Becky is really bummed you haven't called.

30:04.657 --> 30:09.495
Next time you speak with her, tell her I'm
sorry, but I've taken myself off the market.

30:09.579 --> 30:11.831
Now I'm nummed.

30:11.914 --> 30:14.083
Thanks for coming,
I appreciate it, see you later.

30:14.167 --> 30:17.170
Scott, this is Ellie Myers
from the Craig Kilborn show.

30:17.253 --> 30:19.547
- Oh, hi, How are you?
- Hi, It's a pleasure to meet you.

30:19.630 --> 30:21.799
I've been a huge fan of yours
ever since happy Days.

30:21.883 --> 30:25.595
Thank you. Listen, I appreciate you
meeting me here, I couldn't bail on tonight.

30:25.678 --> 30:26.805
It's fine.

30:26.847 --> 30:28.848
You guys have a nice chat.
I'll be over here if you need me.

30:28.931 --> 30:30.768
OK.

30:30.850 --> 30:33.686
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

30:33.770 --> 30:37.023
Craig is so excited
to have you on his show.

30:37.106 --> 30:40.443
I think it's gonna be
just a fabulous line-up.

30:40.860 --> 30:44.822
You'll be going on third,
after Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top.

30:44.906 --> 30:46.824
- Third?
- Uh...

30:46.866 --> 30:49.035
I thought that we would start
with a Chachi clip,

30:49.076 --> 30:51.369
and then move on
to something from Charles in charge.

30:51.411 --> 30:53.581
- Original.
- And, uh...

30:53.623 --> 31:01.460
and then we could...

31:02.882 --> 31:05.510
segue into what you're doing now.

31:07.471 --> 31:10.766
You know, you're a beautiful girl.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.270
I mean, you've got this aura thing
happening, l...

31:16.312 --> 31:18.897
I just can't quite put my finger on it.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.568
Not when you can use your whole hand.

31:21.652 --> 31:25.613
Thank you, I think that's really
all we needed to discuss

31:25.696 --> 31:27.990
and I'll see you in the studio.

31:28.074 --> 31:30.326
- OK, You got it.
- OK.

31:35.666 --> 31:38.377
Wanna finish your drink?

31:39.669 --> 31:41.421
No, Bye.

31:42.463 --> 31:44.465
Okey-doke.

31:44.757 --> 31:46.383
Excuse me.

31:46.425 --> 31:48.762
- Hey, where are you going?
- Call us!

31:48.846 --> 31:50.763
Ellie.

31:50.805 --> 31:52.724
Ellie, wait up.

31:52.807 --> 31:55.726
Jake, I really don't feel well tonight,
I just wanna get home.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.938
Be careful with this one.
He's trouble.

32:00.773 --> 32:04.444
- Who's the leopard?
- Someone I met before I met you.

32:04.485 --> 32:09.365
- They keep popping up, don't they?
- Ellie, that was a previous life.

32:09.407 --> 32:11.658
Please, you gotta trust me on this.

32:11.742 --> 32:14.912
You know what?
I think it's my turn to be weird.

32:14.954 --> 32:18.166
I'm gonna take a cue from you
and disappear for a few days.

32:18.207 --> 32:20.251
Ellie, people can change.

32:20.376 --> 32:23.712
I really don't wanna get into it right now.

35:48.376 --> 35:51.421
Close, close, close, close!

36:01.347 --> 36:03.098
Oh, my God.

36:09.063 --> 36:11.733
Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?

36:30.500 --> 36:33.087
Get me the fuck out of here!
Open up!

37:59.048 --> 38:01.509
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:07.348 --> 38:08.598
Are you doing homework?

38:08.640 --> 38:11.437
I'm just reading up
on how you kill a werewolf.

38:11.478 --> 38:12.895
Silver, right?

38:12.979 --> 38:17.984
No, you actually have to separate the head
from the heart, silver just hurts a lot.

38:18.067 --> 38:20.278
It might not be such a bad deal.
Think about it.

38:20.361 --> 38:24.115
increased strength, heightened senses,
an unnatural sexual allure.

38:24.198 --> 38:26.659
When do we sprout hair and pointy ears?

38:26.742 --> 38:29.454
It's all a little sketchy,
but maybe never, maybe tomorrow.

38:29.537 --> 38:31.664
The experts can't really agree
on that one.

38:32.123 --> 38:35.835
You're starting to freak me out, Jimmy.
This is fiction, Myth.

38:35.918 --> 38:38.421
We live in reality.
Come back to the other side.

38:38.463 --> 38:42.759
I know, I know, but the line between
fiction and fact has always been a thin one.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.512
Don't we have enough problems? Do you
really wanna add this one to the list?

38:46.554 --> 38:50.016
OK, here.
Check this out. Here.

38:50.057 --> 38:52.435
It's a five-pointed star.
It's a pentagram.

38:52.477 --> 38:54.979
It's the mark of the beast.

38:55.062 --> 38:57.982
Jimmy, this is ridiculous.
You need...

38:58.065 --> 39:00.108
Whoa, Jesus.

39:02.111 --> 39:04.781
Wait, is this for real?

39:06.158 --> 39:08.368
Last night was difficult, OK?

39:08.452 --> 39:11.580
The wreck, the girl dying,
it brought up a lot of stuff.

39:11.663 --> 39:14.372
- No, no, no, Ellie, don't start with that.
- I know we don't talk about it enough.

39:14.456 --> 39:18.377
- It has nothing to do with Mom and Dad.
- I miss them too.

39:19.587 --> 39:22.633
Your hand.
It's a creepy coincidence.

39:23.466 --> 39:26.761
This is some pretty freaky shit.
Admit it.

39:28.262 --> 39:30.265
OK, OK.

39:31.265 --> 39:33.769
Let's put it to the test.

39:37.189 --> 39:40.358
I bought this frame myself,
three years ago.

39:40.441 --> 39:43.361
It's from Tiffany's.
It's sterling silver.

39:43.444 --> 39:47.073
Now, if I'm a werewolf.
I shouldn't be able to pick it up, right?

39:47.156 --> 39:51.995
- It should hurt me, right?
- According to chapter four, yeah.

39:59.836 --> 40:03.173
Go to bed, Jimmy.
It's late.

41:05.735 --> 41:07.779
shut up!

41:11.909 --> 41:14.036
shut up

41:41.062 --> 41:44.189
Don't forget.
I'm working the opening of Tinsel tonight.

41:44.272 --> 41:48.236
- I've gotta take Craig down the red carpet.
- OK.

42:04.710 --> 42:06.129
Hello?

42:08.089 --> 42:10.758
Hey, Jake's been calling all morning,
says he needs to talk.

42:10.842 --> 42:14.594
Well, I don't need to talk to him,
What's with the gypsies?

42:14.678 --> 42:19.267
Oh, it's auditions for Craig's séance
segment. What is with this new look?

42:19.350 --> 42:24.980
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not complaining, I think you look hot.

42:25.981 --> 42:29.317
- You're in danger.
- Excuse me?

42:29.401 --> 42:31.696
It will come for you.

42:31.737 --> 42:36.326
Don't let this getup fool you, I'm not a joke.
I've got the gift, I blame my mother.

42:36.409 --> 42:38.369
Why are you talking to me?

42:41.498 --> 42:43.666
You bear the markings of the beast.

42:43.750 --> 42:47.837
Look, I'm not trying to freak you out,
but you've been infected. You're cursed.

42:47.879 --> 42:50.882
You've got to sever the line of the beast.
It's the only way to break the curse.

42:50.964 --> 42:53.676
OK, all psychics
back in their seats, please.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.720
The beast is human too.
Don't forget that.

42:56.804 --> 43:00.141
- And it's closer to you than you think.
- If you could just follow me.

43:00.183 --> 43:05.396
Shouldn't you psychically know
when you're annoying someone?

43:07.231 --> 43:09.316
Thank you.

43:10.359 --> 43:14.697
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me, Miss, Get up and get out.

43:15.156 --> 43:17.325
Look at him.

43:31.630 --> 43:33.381
Yeah!

43:50.233 --> 43:52.902
Oh, Brooke, hey.

43:52.985 --> 43:55.948
- Are you stalking me?
- Maybe.

43:56.823 --> 44:01.076
What's going on, Brooke?
You going fruit fly on me?

44:01.159 --> 44:05.248
Actually, we were just talking,
but, if you don't mind... shoo.

44:06.124 --> 44:08.042
Oh, you are asking for it, Abercrombie.

44:08.126 --> 44:10.212
Come on, Bo.
You're really becoming transparent.

44:10.254 --> 44:11.838
How about a little
identity intervention, OK?

44:11.921 --> 44:16.259
'Cause all this internalized homophobia's
giving you away.

44:17.844 --> 44:21.222
- You better watch your ass.
- What's going on?

44:21.264 --> 44:24.226
I'm just giving Jimmy some pointers.

44:25.226 --> 44:28.270
- He's here to try out for the team.
- Really? You?

44:28.729 --> 44:31.731
Are you sure
you want to do that, Jimmy?

44:31.815 --> 44:33.860
Oh, sure he does, coach.

44:33.943 --> 44:37.614
I'll tell you what.
I'll wrestle him.

44:41.075 --> 44:44.579
No, Louie, you and Jimmy take the mat.

44:44.662 --> 44:47.332
Jimmy, suit up.

44:49.834 --> 44:51.878
He's so dead.

44:55.380 --> 44:59.969
OK, limp wrist, stay away from my groin.

45:01.805 --> 45:04.348
Take him down, Louie.
Take him down.

45:13.524 --> 45:15.401
- Have you had enough?
- Uh-uh.

45:15.485 --> 45:17.988
Let him up.

45:18.030 --> 45:20.157
Watch his nails, Lou!

45:20.240 --> 45:22.824
He might scratch your eyes out!

45:38.674 --> 45:40.760
- You OK, Lou?
- All right.

45:45.766 --> 45:48.266
- Let me take a crack, coach.
- Are you up for it, Jimmy?

45:48.350 --> 45:50.435
Yeah.

45:50.519 --> 45:52.605
Go for it, Bo.

45:58.529 --> 46:03.282
- Come on, fairy, shake your dust.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

46:06.536 --> 46:09.456
Come on, fag, What?
Do you like that? Huh?

46:13.669 --> 46:15.294
Wait, no...

46:38.192 --> 46:43.406
You know the best part about being a fairy?
You get to fly.

46:46.409 --> 46:51.372
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

46:55.918 --> 46:58.629
- Ashton Kutcher's up first.
- God, he's so overexposed.

46:58.713 --> 47:02.133
stick to his film career as talk points.
Don't linger on the TV stuff.

47:02.216 --> 47:08.055
And if he doesn't mention the lnternet
sex scandal, just don't bring it up.

47:08.139 --> 47:10.683
OK, you know what?
I've done this before.

47:10.767 --> 47:13.144
- OK, I bump Baio.
- What?

47:13.227 --> 47:16.022
I'm living dangerously.
Carrot Top's rehearsal was funny.

47:16.063 --> 47:19.233
I'm gonna let the Top go long.
Randy's dealing with it.

47:19.317 --> 47:22.069
- OK.
- My mouth's dry.

47:22.153 --> 47:23.697
Thanks.

47:23.780 --> 47:27.158
- You want me to do that?
- I got it. Ouch. Dammit! Look.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.701
What happened?

47:29.743 --> 47:32.830
- Do you have a tissue?
- Just stare at it.

47:35.291 --> 47:38.377
<i>It's the Late Late Show
with Craig Kilborn.</i>

47:38.461 --> 47:41.280
OK, Go, Go! You're on.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.925
<i>Mr Craig Kilborn.</i>

47:58.272 --> 48:01.317
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Ellie?

48:01.400 --> 48:03.694
What the fuck do you mean.
'Scott’s been bumped?'

48:04.154 --> 48:07.197
- I just heard, We'll reschedule.
- Reschedule, my ass.

48:07.281 --> 48:10.158
- I'm sorry, The show was running long.
- Then bump Carrot Top.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.080
It's Scott Baio, He shouldn't be
going after Carrot Top anyway.

48:13.163 --> 48:14.789
- He should be first.
- I'll make it up to you.

48:14.831 --> 48:18.584
- Listen to me, you little...
- Don't start with me!

48:37.727 --> 48:40.315
Hi, Ellie.

48:49.866 --> 48:52.285
Are you OK in there?

48:52.368 --> 48:54.412
I'm fine.

48:58.082 --> 49:00.793
You don't sound fine.

49:13.056 --> 49:15.432
What's the matter?

49:21.230 --> 49:23.859
Ellie?

49:23.901 --> 49:25.735
No!

49:32.909 --> 49:34.703
Ellie.

49:41.417 --> 49:44.337
Ellie, your hand.

49:55.889 --> 49:57.767
Ellie.

49:58.726 --> 50:00.978
What's wrong?

50:01.020 --> 50:04.483
I'm just having a really bad day.

50:05.191 --> 50:07.318
Just leave.

50:09.028 --> 50:11.114
Can I help?

50:11.197 --> 50:14.325
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

50:38.558 --> 50:40.393
Hey, Jake.

50:40.476 --> 50:42.145
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

50:42.228 --> 50:44.647
Cool place.
Are all clubs like this?

50:44.689 --> 50:47.859
I sure hope not or I'm in nig trouble.

50:48.859 --> 50:52.320
So what's up, Jimmy?
What are you doing here?

50:52.405 --> 50:56.785
Yeah, l... I kind of need someone
to talk to. Is that OK?

50:57.784 --> 51:00.539
Yeah, of course it is,
step inside.

51:00.622 --> 51:06.627
OK, look, Ellie won't admit it, but ever since
the other night things have been different.

51:06.711 --> 51:08.838
- We're different.
- What night? What are you talking about?

51:08.921 --> 51:11.257
- Didn't Ellie tell you?
- No, Tell me what?

51:11.299 --> 51:16.261
We were in a wreck in the canyon.
A girl was killed.

51:16.303 --> 51:18.973
she was ripped apart.

51:19.056 --> 51:20.725
By...

51:20.768 --> 51:23.186
I don't know, by some kind of animal.

51:23.269 --> 51:26.440
Whatever it was bit me and now
things have been happening to me.

51:26.523 --> 51:30.902
Things I can't explain.
Jake, I know it sounds crazy.

51:31.110 --> 51:33.196
nut I think it was a...

51:33.279 --> 51:35.364
a werewolf.

51:35.448 --> 51:37.493
Hm,

51:37.950 --> 51:40.954
- What does your sister say about all this?
- You know Ellie.

51:41.038 --> 51:45.373
Deny and avoid. It's her thing. But it got
her too and now I think we're cursed.

51:45.457 --> 51:47.502
Look, I almost
took a guy's head off in gym.

51:47.585 --> 51:52.214
I'm not the kind of guy to take
another guy's head off, I mean, look at me.

51:52.297 --> 51:54.676
What if it comes back?

51:54.718 --> 52:00.765
I mean, I know enough to know that it's
a who, not a what, so it could be pissed off.

52:00.848 --> 52:02.308
It may want to finish what it started.

52:02.391 --> 52:04.728
Jimmy, I think
you just need to calm down.

52:04.812 --> 52:08.315
I think the best thing we can do
is just call your sister.

52:08.398 --> 52:12.360
Get her down here and maybe the three
of us should just sit down and discuss it.

52:12.443 --> 52:16.154
I don't want to discuss this, I've been
cursed, something bad is gonna happen.

52:16.196 --> 52:18.199
I can... Look, I can feel it.

52:18.282 --> 52:21.203
Jimmy, listen to yourself.

52:22.246 --> 52:24.122
Werewolves?

52:26.748 --> 52:29.043
- This was a mistake, sorry I bothered you.
- Jimmy.

52:29.127 --> 52:31.462
No, no, Thanks.

53:26.100 --> 53:28.770
Jesus Christ.

53:34.608 --> 53:40.156
- Bo, What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to, kind of, talk.

53:40.239 --> 53:43.035
About that stuff you said today.

53:46.079 --> 53:48.456
What stuff?

53:49.749 --> 53:52.709
About me,
I was just wondering how you knew.

53:52.752 --> 53:55.588
No one else did, just you.

53:55.671 --> 54:00.258
And I've been so shitty to you,
And then I thought,

54:00.342 --> 54:03.512
why wouldn't you know?
It takes one to know one, right?

54:03.553 --> 54:07.433
- Of course, you would know.
- Know what?

54:11.104 --> 54:13.690
Whoa, Whoa,
What are you doing?

54:13.773 --> 54:16.149
I'm gay.

54:16.191 --> 54:21.156
I just can't keep it in anymore, I had to tell
you, you're the only other gay guy I know.

54:21.198 --> 54:24.408
Whoa, OK, stop. No, I'm not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

54:24.493 --> 54:29.162
- This is hard for me. Don't be like this.
- Trust me, Bo. I'm not gay. I'm cursed.

54:29.246 --> 54:33.167
I know, sure feels like that, doesn't it?
Not being able to tell anyone.

54:33.209 --> 54:36.003
- Talk to anyone about it.
- No, I'm cursed by the mark of the beast.

54:36.086 --> 54:37.631
Bo.

54:37.714 --> 54:40.133
I'm a werewolf.

54:42.343 --> 54:45.471
Come on, Jimmy. You don't
have to pretend anymore. Not with me.

54:45.555 --> 54:50.351
No, it's part of the curse. I'm appealing.
I have an unnatural sexual allure.

54:50.435 --> 54:52.146
Yeah, yeah, you do, I know.

54:52.187 --> 54:54.355
Look, dude, I'm happy for you.
You be gay. It's a good thing.

54:54.439 --> 54:58.568
Unfortunately, I got my own shit
to take care of, so best of luck. Yay, go gay.

54:58.651 --> 55:01.028
And I'll see you.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.073
Hey, Jimmy, wait.

55:04.157 --> 55:05.533
Jimmy.

55:33.269 --> 55:35.522
Liar.

55:39.817 --> 55:41.902
Hey, Zipper.

55:42.653 --> 55:43.780
Hey.

55:51.079 --> 55:52.538
Hey.

55:52.621 --> 55:55.208
Hey, Zipper.
Hey, that's mine.

55:56.250 --> 55:58.711
Hey, Hey, Zipper. Drop it.

55:59.128 --> 56:01.215
Hey, No, drop it.

56:01.672 --> 56:03.091
Zip.

56:03.257 --> 56:06.260
Hey, Hey, come on.
Get out of it. Let's go.

56:08.888 --> 56:11.057
No, Zipper!

56:11.140 --> 56:12.350
Zipper.

56:24.070 --> 56:26.030
Zipper.

56:27.615 --> 56:29.867
- Bo, what are you doing here?
- We're not through yet.

56:29.909 --> 56:32.412
No, no, no.
We gotta go. Now.

56:33.538 --> 56:36.332
- Holy shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go! Come on.

56:39.752 --> 56:40.920
Fuck me.

56:56.853 --> 56:58.896
- What the fuck was that?
- That was my dog.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.732
- What kind of dog do you have?
- I have a regular dog.

57:01.774 --> 57:04.777
Or he was, until he bit me.
I infected him.

57:05.027 --> 57:08.114
- I told you. I'm a werewolf.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

57:08.197 --> 57:12.201
Look, I gotta find my sister.
Give me your cellphone.

57:12.493 --> 57:16.165
Thanks, I know. Just keep your eyes on the
road, all right? Animals, they sometimes...

57:21.169 --> 57:24.547
shit, stupid canyons. Look,
she's going to a club opening, at Tinsel.

57:24.589 --> 57:27.758
- Oh, on the strip. Got it, I'm with you.
- OK, All right, settle down.

57:35.809 --> 57:39.771
<i>...killed 23 people
and wounded more than 100 on Saturday.</i>

57:39.854 --> 57:44.149
<i>In breaking news,

57:44.191 --> 57:46.695
<i>Another woman,

57:46.737 --> 57:49.864

57:57.497 --> 58:00.249
I'll drink, you can drive.

58:00.333 --> 58:02.418
Ready?

58:02.460 --> 58:06.798
Kyle, can you cover for me tonight?
I've gotta get home.

58:07.798 --> 58:10.218
You're gonna miss Jake's big opening?

58:10.301 --> 58:13.137
- Ellie?
- I guess.

58:18.434 --> 58:21.395
- Good night, Ellie.
- Oh, good night.

58:34.158 --> 58:35.742
Ellie.

58:36.618 --> 58:38.745
Ellie, please.

58:43.794 --> 58:45.753
You scared me.

58:45.837 --> 58:49.257
I'm sorry,
but I needed to talk to you, Ellie.

58:49.340 --> 58:51.801
You haven't been returning my calls.

58:51.843 --> 58:55.680
You knew those girls, Becky and Jenny.

58:55.763 --> 58:58.434
They're both dead.

58:58.516 --> 59:02.602
I know, but, Ellie,
I can explain everything.

59:02.686 --> 59:04.187
Ellie!

59:05.566 --> 59:08.151
Ellie, Ellie!

59:21.581 --> 59:24.250
Get out of the car, Ellie.

59:26.502 --> 59:28.504
Please.

59:34.677 --> 59:38.390
Look, I'm sorry about your window.
I didn't mean to do that.

59:38.556 --> 59:41.518
but I have a lot of things
that I have to explain to you

59:41.602 --> 59:46.939
and they're all going to sound a little crazy
so I just need you to hear me out.

59:47.023 --> 59:49.234
Give me back my keys first.

59:57.824 --> 01:00:00.911
What attacked you in the canyon
wasn't just an animal.

01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:05.374
- What was it?
- You already know the answer to that.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:07.668
You can feel the changes, can't you?

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:13.216
Ellie!

01:00:33.277 --> 01:00:38.240
How's it going? These are my plus-ones
right here, all the way to the end, there.

01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:40.576
Hey, man.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.956
- Hey, Bo, can I use your cell?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:48.084
Hey, I'm gonna go look.
see if anybody's seen your sister,

01:00:55.298 --> 01:00:56.801
- Hello?
- Ellie?

01:00:56.884 --> 01:00:59.512
- Jimmy, thank God. Where are you?
- I'm at Tinsel.

01:00:59.595 --> 01:01:00.805
- What?
- No, it's OK.

01:01:00.888 --> 01:01:03.266
What are you doing there?
I'm on my way home.

01:01:03.307 --> 01:01:06.143
Ellie, don't go home. Look,
I infected Zipper and he's gone werewolf.

01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:09.771
- You gotta believe me. Look, it's all true.
- I believe you, OK?

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:11.941
I'd believe anything at this point.

01:01:12.024 --> 01:01:14.318
- Jimmy, it's Jake.
- What? Jake?

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.446
he's the one who attacked us.
he's the werewolf.

01:01:16.529 --> 01:01:20.491
- Ellie, I'm freaking out.
- Kyle should be there, OK? Just find him.

01:01:20.533 --> 01:01:23.661
stay low.
Jake is definitely gonna be there.

01:01:23.745 --> 01:01:26.038
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:37.633
Jimmy. Have you seen Ellie?
I just really need to find her, right away.

01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:40.511
- Jake, Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:42.513
- The place looks amazing.
- Thank you.

01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:44.973
- lncredible. Congratulations. Excuse me.
- Wait, Jimmy, I really need to...

01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:48.059
Did I introduce you to Scott?
Scott, this is Jake.

01:01:48.143 --> 01:01:50.521
- Hey, man. How are you doing?
- Good, thanks, Thanks for coming.

01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:53.398
Can I excuse myself for one second?

01:01:53.732 --> 01:01:54.985
Jimmy?

01:01:57.737 --> 01:01:59.697
- That thing looks real.
- I think it is.

01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:02.784
- Find your sister?
- No, actually...

01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:05.745
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.
- What? Is he a werewolf hunter?

01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:06.954
No, no, He's trouble.

01:02:07.038 --> 01:02:09.957
Tell the guys to look out for a young guy,
about yea tall, brown hair.

01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:11.209
He's a little jumpy so be discreet.

01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:14.169
Here, come on.
I think we can cut through here.

01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:17.924
Come on. Come on.
We can get out the back way. Come on.

01:02:24.639 --> 01:02:25.973
Kyle.

01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:27.709
Kyle.

01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:30.436
- Kyle, Have you seen my brother?
- Jimmy's here?

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.023
- I've gotta find him, it's an emergency.
- Ellie, you need to tell me what's going on.

01:02:34.107 --> 01:02:37.569
- I wish I could.
- Hey, have you seen Kilborn?

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:40.321
He ditched me.

01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:02.385
- ...out of here, baby.
- Hold on. Find me...

01:03:06.514 --> 01:03:09.434
- Bo, over here,
- Jimmy?

01:03:10.726 --> 01:03:12.436
Ellie.

01:03:12.895 --> 01:03:15.940
- Please, Ellie. Don't be afraid.
- Stay away from me, Jake.

01:03:16.023 --> 01:03:20.069
- But it wasn't me.
- Bullshit, I saw your hands.

01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:22.946
- There's another one like me.
- Is that your sister?

01:03:22.988 --> 01:03:25.158
- I think so.
- I don't know who it is.

01:03:25.241 --> 01:03:28.828
But that's who killed those girls.
It's trying to get to me.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.998
Please, you have to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:38.212
- I don't know what to believe.
- Ellie, I was born with this curse.

01:03:38.296 --> 01:03:41.007
I know how to control it.

01:03:41.466 --> 01:03:45.471
I've learned to live with something terrible.
Just like you.

01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:48.055
We're not that different.

01:03:48.139 --> 01:03:50.390
- We can do this.
- How do you know that?

01:03:50.474 --> 01:03:52.893
Because, Ellie.

01:03:52.935 --> 01:03:54.979
- I love you.
- No!

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.190
- Please.
- Ellie. Come on.

01:03:57.273 --> 01:03:58.191
Ellie.

01:03:58.274 --> 01:04:00.778
I love you.

01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:02.570
Please.

01:04:09.495 --> 01:04:11.287
Jake!

01:04:17.126 --> 01:04:19.462
Where is it?
Where are they?

01:04:35.311 --> 01:04:38.231
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit!

01:04:40.025 --> 01:04:42.901
- OK, you go that way, I'll go this way.
- OK.

01:04:44.903 --> 01:04:47.949
Bo?

01:04:48.116 --> 01:04:49.325
Bo?

01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:51.720
No, don't go in there.
It's not safe.

01:04:51.786 --> 01:04:52.995
No, Stop.

01:04:53.205 --> 01:04:59.085
Randy, Randy, you gotta get everyone
out of there and you gotta radio for help.

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:00.253
Why?

01:05:14.183 --> 01:05:16.853
Are you OK?
Come on, get up.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.064
- Ellie!
- Jimmy.

01:05:20.356 --> 01:05:22.776
Come on.
It's a fucking werewolf.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.911
Jimmy!

01:05:35.038 --> 01:05:38.040
- Have you seen my brother?
- He must be out front.

01:05:38.082 --> 01:05:40.752
No, he's not, I've looked everywhere.
He's not out there.

01:05:40.835 --> 01:05:43.796
There's nobody left
in there except for...that!

01:05:45.089 --> 01:05:46.340
Jimmy!

01:05:49.135 --> 01:05:50.386
Jimmy!

01:06:01.064 --> 01:06:02.316
Jimmy.

01:06:13.951 --> 01:06:14.786
Jimmy.

01:06:16.954 --> 01:06:18.121
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:21.125
- OK. We gotta get outta here.
- I know.

01:06:23.127 --> 01:06:26.006
- Ellie.
- Kyle, what...

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:28.049
What the hell's happening?

01:06:28.132 --> 01:06:32.970
I heard people screaming,
and then I lost Craig, I lost Craig.

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.432
- Stay away from us.
- What? Why?

01:06:36.516 --> 01:06:38.768
Show me your hand.

01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:44.148
- The other hand.
- Ellie.

01:06:44.315 --> 01:06:46.567
We don't have time for this.

01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:51.113
There's an animal on the loose.
It could be anywhere.

01:06:54.992 --> 01:06:57.995
What? You guys hear something?

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.881
- Where the fuck did he go?
- I don't know.

01:07:14.719 --> 01:07:15.763
Jimmy?

01:07:21.978 --> 01:07:23.396
Come on.

01:07:23.479 --> 01:07:25.189
- Come on, come on. Keep going.
- But it's closed.

01:07:25.231 --> 01:07:27.525
- Shit, we can't get out. We're fucked.
- Where are we going?

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:30.528
I don't know, shit.
Where does this go? Come on.

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:37.286
- Shit,
- There should be doors. Look for a door.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.957
- There's nothing. Look over there.
- OK.

01:07:46.669 --> 01:07:49.464
No, they're not here.

01:07:51.675 --> 01:07:53.719
- Weren't there three?
- What?

01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:55.552
There's three microphones.
There's only two...

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:56.971
Jimmy!

01:08:00.767 --> 01:08:04.730
- Showtime. lsn't that what they say?
- Joannie.

01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.647
Just for the record, I didn't ask for this.

01:08:07.732 --> 01:08:11.319
It was just a hot night
with the guy that every girl in town wanted.

01:08:11.402 --> 01:08:14.113
Lucky me,
I should've been more careful though.

01:08:14.197 --> 01:08:19.410
I got a little rough in bed and wound up
cursed by the mark of the fucking beast.

01:08:19.743 --> 01:08:23.913
- That Jake, he's a catch.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:24.499 --> 01:08:28.294
I thought he was the one, you know, but all
I got was a couple of dates, some hot sex,

01:08:28.336 --> 01:08:32.506
and a 'I'm not ready for a relationship
right now, It's not you, it's me,'

01:08:32.925 --> 01:08:35.885
Men, They're all beasts.

01:08:35.968 --> 01:08:39.845
Jake didn't want me.
And if I can't have him...

01:08:40.598 --> 01:08:43.227
Well, you know how that line goes.

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:52.401
The funny thing is,
I never saw you as a threat.

01:08:52.484 --> 01:08:55.529
I find you rather depressing myself.

01:08:56.197 --> 01:09:00.576
Why do men always go for
the tortured ones? Poor damaged Ellie.

01:09:02.787 --> 01:09:04.246
Bitch!

01:09:08.584 --> 01:09:11.087
Who's lost it now?

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:29.147
OK, Just the two of us, Fair fight, OK?
Just me and you, All right? Come on.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.066
- OK,
- I'm right here.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:34.361
OK, Let's go.

01:09:37.196 --> 01:09:40.783
Fair fight?
This is Hollywood.

01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:42.702
And you...

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.828
You get one taste of blood
and you freak out.

01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:52.295
Jimmy, Jimmy.

01:10:14.192 --> 01:10:16.235
Come on, run.

01:10:33.086 --> 01:10:36.006
Jake? You bounce back quickly.

01:10:37.298 --> 01:10:38.883
Hi.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.054
- It's you?
- Yeah.

01:10:44.055 --> 01:10:47.225
- How did this happen, Joannie?
- Well.

01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:52.980
I guess there's no such thing
as safe sex with a werewolf.

01:10:56.068 --> 01:11:01.280
Joannie, it doesn't have to be like this
for you, There are ways for you to control it.

01:11:01.322 --> 01:11:04.742
Like what? Nibbling on coyotes
in the desert# No thanks.

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:07.327
I'm having too much fun
eliminating the competition.

01:11:07.494 --> 01:11:10.456
Pretty soon I'll have you all to myself.

01:11:11.457 --> 01:11:14.168
I won't let you kill her, Joannie.

01:11:14.919 --> 01:11:16.088
Jake!

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.673
Honey, muffin.

01:11:18.797 --> 01:11:21.634
I am not gonna kill her, I promise.

01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:25.847
I'm just gonna rip her to shreds
and let her choke on her own blood.

01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:27.265
Then...

01:11:27.472 --> 01:11:29.475
maybe I'll eat her.

01:11:29.559 --> 01:11:32.312
You have to kill me first.

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.735
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:45.492
Well, I've learned a few things about
this curse along the way, and I know better.

01:11:46.492 --> 01:11:51.663
But that doesn't mean
I can't make it hurt a little.

01:12:03.968 --> 01:12:06.679
- I don't see her.
- Sh.

01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:23.154
Ellie?

01:12:38.295 --> 01:12:41.631
Let's see how she deals with these.

01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:47.804
I'm gonna get you.

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:52.017
Where are you, you bitch?

01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:54.477
Get this off!

01:13:01.317 --> 01:13:03.820
Where's your brother?

01:13:50.366 --> 01:13:53.703
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

01:13:53.745 --> 01:13:56.330
Well, maybe she left.

01:13:57.248 --> 01:13:59.625
Or maybe not.

01:14:10.929 --> 01:14:13.681
- Did she see us?
- I don't think...

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:17.393
Run! Jimmy, get out of here.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.231
Jimmy!

01:14:38.499 --> 01:14:39.749
Ellie.

01:14:58.226 --> 01:14:59.726
Ellie, wake up.

01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:03.981
Wake up.

01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:29.173
You're playing with us,
aren't you, Joannie?

01:15:29.215 --> 01:15:30.382
Ellie.

01:15:31.467 --> 01:15:33.970
Well, play this!

01:15:45.983 --> 01:15:48.443
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:15:48.526 --> 01:15:49.944
- Move along, Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:50.027 --> 01:15:51.070
Shit!

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:01.873
Move it.

01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:04.208
- Freeze!.
- Don't shoot.

01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:08.378
- Where's the animal?
- It's up there somewhere.

01:16:08.462 --> 01:16:11.507
- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know, stay alert, guys.

01:16:11.591 --> 01:16:16.262
- What the hell is it, anyway?
- Oh, it's a werewolf. What?

01:16:17.346 --> 01:16:20.308
- Did you say werewolf?
- Yeah.

01:16:20.391 --> 01:16:22.684
she may have changed back
to her human form.

01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:26.981
Her name is Joannie.
She's this hyper, skinny publicist.

01:16:27.982 --> 01:16:31.486
- Any other description?
- Yeah, she's, what?! Like, five foot seven?

01:16:31.569 --> 01:16:34.614
She's got a bony ass,

01:16:34.697 --> 01:16:38.242
and fat thighs, and bad skin,

01:16:38.284 --> 01:16:41.120
Liar!

01:16:42.872 --> 01:16:44.582
Shoot!

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:55.717
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

01:17:09.357 --> 01:17:12.402
- Man, that's ugly.
- Careful.

01:17:15.738 --> 01:17:17.572
It's dead. All clear.

01:17:20.118 --> 01:17:23.121
- Stand down.
- What is this thing?

01:17:23.204 --> 01:17:26.165
I told you, it's a werewolf.
You have to separate the head from the..

01:17:31.796 --> 01:17:33.964
Repeat, all clear.

01:17:34.048 --> 01:17:37.009
Call animal control.

01:17:37.593 --> 01:17:40.304
- Get them out of here.
Is she dead?

01:17:40.388 --> 01:17:44.558
Yeah. Her brain's on the floor.
That should do it.

01:17:44.683 --> 01:17:46.685
- Jake.
- Bo.

01:17:47.186 --> 01:17:50.731
Hey, I need a paramedic in here.

01:17:56.778 --> 01:17:58.656
Bo, Bo, Bo.

01:17:59.365 --> 01:18:01.868
- Yeah.
- Are you OK?

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:06.539
- Hey, Jimbo. How'd I do?
- You did good.

01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:09.083
- I'm gonna go look for Jake, OK?
- Yeah.

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.210
Hey, you good?

01:18:11.294 --> 01:18:15.465
Yeah. He sucker-punched me.
I was about to kick his ass.

01:18:24.557 --> 01:18:26.893
Did you find him?

01:18:27.852 --> 01:18:29.562
No.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.988
- I'm telling you, we shot the shit out of this.
- Really?

01:18:39.155 --> 01:18:42.366
You're gonna need a forklift.
This thing is...

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.286
huge.

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.890
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

01:19:06.933 --> 01:19:09.310
- I think so.
- Yeah.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.441
so, it's over, right?

01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:18.860
And Joannie's dead, so we're OK now..

01:19:18.945 --> 01:19:24.033
Well, that's subjective, We still have
to go back to our pathetic precurse lives.

01:19:24.117 --> 01:19:29.247
- I'm personally OK with that.
- Well, you're not in high school.

01:19:34.961 --> 01:19:37.380
What happened?

01:19:37.547 --> 01:19:38.966
Zipper.

01:19:55.232 --> 01:19:57.234
Are you OK?

01:19:58.108 --> 01:20:00.235
I will be.

01:20:01.738 --> 01:20:05.199
What's wrong?
Are you worried about Jake?

01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:09.246
- His secret's out. He had to disappear.
- I don't want to talk about it, OK?

01:20:09.329 --> 01:20:11.665
I know you think he's a good guy, Ellie,
but don't forget, all of this...

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:14.040
...everything we've been through,
is because of him.

01:20:14.082 --> 01:20:16.794
When it comes down to it,
a monster is still a monster.

01:20:16.919 --> 01:20:22.008
- Jimmy. That's enough.
- I guess some things never change.

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:28.222
- Do you think you can get us some light?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll check the circuit breaker.

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:42.945
Zipper?

01:20:52.954 --> 01:20:57.794
- How are you doing with those lights?
- Yeah, one second.

01:20:58.961 --> 01:20:59.796
Shit.

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:02.465
Is everything OK down there?

01:21:02.548 --> 01:21:05.176
Yeah, it's fine, I just...

01:21:57.854 --> 01:21:59.897
Thank you.

01:22:47.945 --> 01:22:49.614
Zipper?

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.830
It's OK, It's just me.

01:22:57.914 --> 01:23:01.750
Sorry, I'm still working on the fuses. It's
a little dark in here, I'll be up in a minute.

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:05.630
Jake.

01:23:05.671 --> 01:23:07.840
How are you, Ellie?

01:23:07.924 --> 01:23:11.052
Jake, something's wrong, I'm...

01:23:12.095 --> 01:23:15.932
It'll be OK. Just breathe.
You'll be OK.

01:23:16.349 --> 01:23:20.353
- What's happening to me?
- It's starting, Ellie.

01:23:21.188 --> 01:23:25.174
- It's almost midnight.
- Oh, no.

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:29.612
Ellie, sh. It's OK.
You're gonna be OK.

01:23:30.154 --> 01:23:32.240
- I came back for you.
- I have to stop it.

01:23:32.323 --> 01:23:35.576
- You have to help me stop it.
- Ellie, it's not really that simple.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.079
But you have nothing to worry about.
This is how we can be together.

01:23:38.162 --> 01:23:40.163
You need this, Ellie.

01:23:40.665 --> 01:23:43.126
You need me.

01:23:44.837 --> 01:23:48.465
- You said it could be controlled.
- You don't have to worry.

01:23:48.714 --> 01:23:52.009
I can teach you how to live with this.
And we have years to figure it out.

01:23:52.092 --> 01:23:55.555
So that's your answer?
We live happily ever after?

01:23:55.638 --> 01:23:58.641
There's no reason why we can't now,

01:24:02.854 --> 01:24:04.856
Think about it.
Your parents are dead.

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:07.482
Your brother is miserable,
your life is a mess.

01:24:07.567 --> 01:24:10.403
Why do you think it is
that you fell for me so hard and so fast?

01:24:10.486 --> 01:24:14.866
I gave you a reason to live again, Ellie.
And I can still do that for you.

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:17.453
- Jake, I don't want this.
- It's the only way we can be together, Ellie.

01:24:17.536 --> 01:24:21.998
But I don't want you.
Tell me how to get rid of it. Tell me how!

01:24:22.081 --> 01:24:26.085
The only way you can break the curse
is for the one who started it all to die.

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:28.505
And that’s me.

01:24:28.589 --> 01:24:32.759
- I'm not ready to die just yet.
- I can't let my brother live like this.

01:24:33.009 --> 01:24:36.221
You know I have to think of him first.

01:24:36.928 --> 01:24:42.059
I know, I bet you promised your parents
that you'd give him a good life, didn't you?

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:45.771
But you know what, Ellie. You're
really not doing a very good job, are you?

01:24:45.855 --> 01:24:50.318
- In fact, you're kind of a disaster.
- Get away from me.

01:24:59.035 --> 01:25:01.245
I don't want you
to worry about your brother, OK?

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:04.039
After all,
there's only room for one alpha male.

01:25:04.414 --> 01:25:07.752
And I really think we should put
the poor kid out of his misery, don't you?

01:25:07.835 --> 01:25:10.130
Where is that brother of yours, anyway?

01:25:11.923 --> 01:25:14.716
Now, where could he be?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.803
In the basement?

01:25:17.887 --> 01:25:20.389
These heightened senses
are a kick, huh?

01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:28.105
No hard feelings, buddy.

01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:31.025
I'll make it as quick as possible.

01:25:41.244 --> 01:25:45.415
- Take it easy with the silver, Ellie.
- You're a monster.

01:25:45.498 --> 01:25:48.042
Join the club.

01:26:00.012 --> 01:26:02.180
That's only the beginning, Ellie.

01:26:04.142 --> 01:26:07.519
I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:12.734
You're too weak to think you could
survive it. It only makes you stronger.

01:26:12.775 --> 01:26:15.194
But you're too stupid, too timid.

01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:30.209
It comes and goes at first.

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:33.838
I probably should've told you that.

01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:35.465
- Unfortunately now you both have to die.
- Hey!

01:26:59.364 --> 01:27:01.991
You'd better run, you little shit.

01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:06.537
I am going to kill you.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.938
Like you said, what doesn't kill you...

01:29:13.538 --> 01:29:15.416
It's over.

01:29:16.626 --> 01:29:21.756
Are you sure?! You were a little off on
that whole 'how to break the curse' thing.

01:29:22.465 --> 01:29:25.510
Yeah, well, the books
kind of glossed over that part.

01:29:25.551 --> 01:29:27.136
Uh-huh.

01:29:35.561 --> 01:29:37.729
We're going to be OK.

01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:45.656
Zipper.

01:29:50.535 --> 01:29:52.453
Brooke.

01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:56.458
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

01:29:56.542 --> 01:30:00.503
I found your dog.
He was wandering the streets.

01:30:01.838 --> 01:30:05.842
- How'd you know where I lived?
- I told her.

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:12.766
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, you?

01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:14.724
I'm good, thanks.

01:30:15.767 --> 01:30:18.479
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

01:30:43.211 --> 01:30:45.673
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:47.843
See you later.

01:30:48.217 --> 01:30:50.636
- Nice moves.
- It's the new me.

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:55.224
I'm just gonna stay here.
And, uh... clean.

01:31:09.946 --> 01:31:12.200
