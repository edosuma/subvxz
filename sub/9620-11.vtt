00:29.929 --> 00:31.564
IF IT WERE THE YEAR 1842,

00:31.631 --> 00:32.098
BUT THE LAST TIME

00:39.005 --> 00:39.506
&gt;&gt; LIKE YOUR THEORY

00:39.572 --> 00:40.006
THAT IF YOU PULL

00:40.073 --> 00:41.007
A HORSE'S TAIL THREE TIMES,

00:41.074 --> 00:43.042
YOU GET ETERNAL LIFE.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.176
I KNOW IT'S LAST MINUTE,

02:58.344 --> 02:59.245
AS TASTEFUL AND REFINED

AS LAST YEAR.

03:08.187 --> 03:08.721
WE ALL KNOW

03:08.788 --> 03:09.722
WHAT BUCKINGHAM PALACE

03:09.789 --> 03:10.523
LOOKS LIKE.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.859
AND WHEN IT WAS BUILT, 1703.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.861
I DID A REPORT ON IT.

03:14.928 --> 03:15.628
&gt;&gt; TRUE, EVERYONE KNOWS

03:15.695 --> 03:16.529
WHEN I GET NERVOUS,

03:16.596 --> 03:17.997

03:24.971 --> 03:25.772

03:25.838 --> 03:26.940
AN AWESOME MIX.

03:27.006 --> 03:27.674

&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT LARS BALTHAZAR?

03:34.847 --> 03:35.949
&gt;&gt; IS THAT A PERSON?

03:36.015 --> 03:36.849
&gt;&gt; HE'S ONLY THE MOST FAMOUS

03:36.916 --> 03:37.984
CELLIST IN THE COUNTRY.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.018
SOME SAY HEARING HIM PLAY

03:39.085 --> 03:40.086

03:48.261 --> 03:48.761
I DON'T EVEN THINK

03:48.828 --> 03:50.096
HE'S LEFT HIS APARTMENT.

03:50.163 --> 03:50.663
&gt;&gt; I CAN GET STARTED

04:54.694 --> 04:55.561
OH, WAIT, TONIGHT IS MY DAD'S

04:55.628 --> 04:56.496
POKER NIGHT.

04:56.562 --> 04:57.830
MY MOM ALWAYS STANDS BEHIND HIM

04:57.897 --> 04:58.665

04:58.731 --> 04:59.699

04:59.766 --> 05:02.669
YOU BETTER BLUFF!"

05:02.735 --> 05:03.803
&gt;&gt; YES, WELL, I WAS THINKING

05:03.870 --> 05:04.804
MORE ALONG THE LINES

05:04.871 --> 05:05.938
OF A FANCY RESTAURANT,

05:06.005 --> 05:07.573
LIKE FINIQUE.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.508
&gt;&gt; BUT DOESN'T MR. MADIGAN

05:08.574 --> 05:09.876
GO THERE ALL THE TIME?

05:09.942 --> 05:10.943
HE SAID IT NEEDS TO BE SOMEWHERE

05:11.010 --> 05:12.045
EXTRA SPECIAL.

05:12.111 --> 05:12.979
&gt;&gt; LIKE WHERE?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.013
&gt;&gt; ISN'T THERE SOME

05:14.080 --> 05:14.947
NEW FANCY RESTAURANT

05:15.014 --> 05:16.015
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.050
&gt;&gt; LE POMPANOUS?

05:17.116 --> 05:18.184
IMPOSSIBLE.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.285
THAT PLACE IS SO EXCLUSIVE,

05:19.352 --> 05:20.119
EVEN THE OWNER'S NEVER BEEN

05:20.186 --> 05:21.020
ALLOWED IN.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.522
AND THEY ONLY TAKE RESERVATIONS

05:22.588 --> 05:23.556
ON THE DAY OF THE RESERVATION,

05:23.623 --> 05:24.657
DURING A FIVE-MINUTE WINDOW

05:24.724 --> 05:26.492
BETWEEN 4:00 AND 4:05

05:26.559 --> 05:27.026
&gt;&gt; THEN THAT MEANS

05:27.093 --> 05:28.528
THEY'RE STILL OPEN FOR TONIGHT.

05:28.594 --> 05:29.328
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,

05:29.395 --> 05:30.697
BE THE FIRST CALLER?

05:30.763 --> 05:31.531
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW MY UNCLE, TROY

05:31.597 --> 05:32.365
WON A KAYAK.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.166
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING

05:33.232 --> 05:33.933
IF THAT WAS THE SAME YEAR

05:34.000 --> 05:36.936
HE GOT LOST AT SEA, IT WAS.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.105
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.139
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT IS THE FANCIEST

05:40.206 --> 05:41.908
RESTAURANT IN THE CITY.

THE BEST PARTY EVER.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.364
&gt;&gt; YEAH, NOTHING

12:12.431 --> 12:17.403

12:17.470 --> 12:18.304
&gt;&gt; QUIT FOOLING AROUND,

12:18.370 --> 12:23.142
WE GOT A BIG PARTY COMING IN.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.343
&gt;&gt; IF WE PUT MAX

12:24.410 --> 12:25.077
WITH LIBBY GIBBLES,

12:25.144 --> 12:25.845
THEN WE HAVE NO ROOM

12:25.911 --> 12:26.679
FOR THE MAYOR.

12:26.745 --> 12:27.413
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF WE MOVE

12:27.480 --> 12:28.280
THAT PERSON?

12:28.347 --> 12:29.782
&gt;&gt; THAT PERSON IS ME.

12:29.849 --> 12:30.416
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.685
&gt;&gt; WRONG.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.019
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WELL, MAYBE WE PUSH

12:34.086 --> 12:35.354

12:36.622 --> 12:38.591

12:38.657 --> 12:39.725
HUH, THE OWNER WOULD THROW US

12:39.792 --> 12:40.893
OUT IN A HEARTBEAT.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.494
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU SAID

12:41.560 --> 12:42.728
THE OWNER'S NEVER BEEN THERE.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.164
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WE CAN TRY THAT.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.031
&gt;&gt; I STILL FEEL KINDA BAD

THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO GET

12:46.799 --> 12:48.367

14:42.781 --> 14:43.682
VALUABLE CUSTOMER.

14:43.749 --> 14:44.550
WE COULD SERVE HIM A BOWL

14:44.617 --> 14:45.451
OF SOUP WITH A SQUIRREL IN IT

14:45.517 --> 14:46.952

15:12.911 --> 15:14.713

15:14.780 --> 15:15.281
&gt;&gt; MAYBE WE CAN GET

THAT SMELL.

15:19.218 --> 15:19.985
WHAT IS THAT?

15:20.052 --> 15:20.586

15:22.288 --> 15:23.722

15:25.858 --> 15:27.126
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WITH A LITTLE WORK,

15:27.192 --> 15:27.726

18:54.066 --> 18:54.833
AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT

18:54.900 --> 18:56.001
THE DINNER IS CANCELED.

18:56.068 --> 19:03.008
&gt;&gt; I'LL DO IT.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.009
&gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL IN THERE.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.210
BALL PITS ARE LIKE QUICKSAND.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.312
THE PLASTIC CREATES A VORTEX.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.347
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, PROFESSOR,

19:08.413 --> 19:12.084
BUT I'LL BE FINE.

19:12.150 --> 19:20.592
MAY I HAVE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.962
&gt;&gt; I WARNED HER.

19:24.029 --> 19:24.696
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT AMANDA

19:24.763 --> 19:26.031
WAS TRYING TO SAY IS,

19:26.098 --> 19:28.100
THIS EVENING IS OVER.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.535
I'M SORRY.

19:29.601 --> 19:35.073
[MUSIC]

19:35.140 --> 19:40.479
&gt;&gt; LARS BALTHAZAR?

19:40.546 --> 19:41.079
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU SAID

19:41.146 --> 19:41.880
HE WASN'T COMING.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.415
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.917
&gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I MIGHT BE

19:44.983 --> 19:51.490
A LITTLE RUSTY.

19:51.557 --> 20:46.345
[MUSIC]

20:46.411 --> 20:47.379
&gt;&gt; SEE, I TOLD YOU

20:47.446 --> 20:48.413
NOBODY LEAVES SNACKLEBERRY

20:48.480 --> 21:01.994
WITHOUT HAVING FUN.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.263
&gt;&gt; ENCHANTE. AU REVOIR.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.467
&gt;&gt; SACRE BLEU.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.801
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY FOR MY COMMENTS

21:09.868 --> 21:11.136
EARLIER, MAXWELL.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.705
THIS DINNER WAS THE MOST UNIQUE

21:13.772 --> 21:15.374
ONE WE HAVE HAD YET.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.608
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, BUT IT'S TRUE

21:16.675 --> 21:18.143
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.645
&gt;&gt; YES, WELL,

21:19.711 --> 21:20.512
I EXPECT WE'LL BE SEEING A LOT

21:20.579 --> 21:22.347
MORE OF YOU AT FUTURE EVENTS.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.248
&gt;&gt; THAT'D BE GREAT.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.282
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT

21:24.349 --> 21:25.517
SMARTING OFF TO YOU EARLIER.

21:25.584 --> 21:26.685
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I THINK

21:26.752 --> 21:30.255
I HAD TOO MUCH HOBO TEA.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.089
&gt;&gt; GOOD NIGHT, MAXWELL.

21:31.156 --> 21:31.823
&gt;&gt; GOOD NIGHT, LIBBY.

21:31.890 --> 21:32.257
[BUZZ]

21:32.324 --> 21:34.359
&gt;&gt; OOH!

21:34.426 --> 21:42.267
&gt;&gt; I WON THIS AT SHOOT-A-BASKET.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.301
&gt;&gt; WE SURE GOT LUCKY.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.470
&gt;&gt; WE SURE DID.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.672
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

21:46.738 --> 21:47.873
I FEAR I HAD A LITTLE WEEWEE

21:47.939 --> 21:53.412
WHEN MISS GIBBLES SHOCKED ME.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.413
&gt;&gt; MR. BALTHAZAR,

21:54.479 --> 21:55.280
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU

21:55.347 --> 21:56.114
FOR COMING TONIGHT.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.349
YOU WERE AMAZING.

21:57.416 --> 21:57.983
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW

21:58.050 --> 21:58.817
ABOUT THAT.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.419
I THINK BINGO'S JAW HARP

22:00.485 --> 22:02.387
REALLY GOT THE CROWD GOING.

22:02.454 --> 22:03.121
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD

22:03.188 --> 22:06.525
A LESSON.

22:06.591 --> 22:07.592
&gt;&gt; IF I CAN ASK, SIR,

22:07.659 --> 22:09.227
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

22:09.294 --> 22:10.829
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT

22:10.896 --> 22:12.731
AND I DECIDED I JUST

22:12.798 --> 22:14.499
HAVE TO DO WHAT I LOVE.

22:14.566 --> 22:15.367
AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK

22:15.434 --> 22:16.301
ABOUT IT

22:16.368 --> 22:19.938
THAT'S THEIR OWN DANG BUSINESS.

22:20.005 --> 22:20.939
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU REALLY SAVED

22:21.006 --> 22:21.573
THE PARTY.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.507
&gt;&gt; AND THE RESTAURANT,

22:22.574 --> 22:23.642
HE'S BUYING THE PLACE.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.376
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

22:24.443 --> 22:25.744
&gt;&gt; YES, AND I'M GOING TO PLAY

22:25.811 --> 22:26.678

22:26.745 --> 22:27.312
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK WE JUST

22:27.379 --> 22:28.246
