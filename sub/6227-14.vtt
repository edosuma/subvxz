WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.009
Previously on
Grimm...

00:02.085 --> 00:03.711
So, we're thinking
this is some kind of

00:03.795 --> 00:05.468
healing stick-magic
wand thing?

00:05.547 --> 00:06.799
Until we know,
it's not a good idea

00:06.882 --> 00:08.322
to have it fall
into the wrong hands.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.014
So, we keep this
to ourselves?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.624
Nobody can know
about this.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.975
At least until we figure out

00:13.055 --> 00:14.935
how to figure out what it is
we're dealing with.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.356
I was thinking...

00:18.435 --> 00:19.937
If you become
a Hexenbiest again?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
We just never talked
about that before.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.985
If and when that happens,
we'll just deal with it.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.665
Who the hell are
you working for?

00:31.949 --> 00:34.202
The people who are
gonna change your life.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.503
We could make you the most
powerful man in the city.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.376
To win, we think
you'll need to have a family.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.752
You already have a daughter.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.911
How do you know about that?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.842
And Adalind's
the mother.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.945
All right, yeah. And
go ahead and call Stapleton.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.301
Let him know that I gave until
start of business on Monday

02:27.356 --> 02:29.233
to counter our offer
on the Baker Street property.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.364
Stapleton, got it.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.695
Anything else that
can't wait till Monday?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.156
Um, oh. Your friends
Drew and Laura

02:35.238 --> 02:37.582
are celebrating their
10-year anniversary on Sunday.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.955
Wow. Ten years.

02:39.034 --> 02:42.379
Uh, okay, I should get them
something appropriate.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.707
I will... Tell you what?
Let me know what you can find.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.758
How much do you want to spend?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.835
Under$500.
I got another call coming in.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.421
Have a great weekend,
Mr. Baske.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.713
See you on Monday.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.174
Yeah.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.303
Hi, Mom.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.350
Are you on your way?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.473
Yeah, I got out of work a
little later than I expected,

02:57.552 --> 02:59.020
but I should be there soon.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.315
Okay. I made a casserole,
it's in the oven.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.516
Oh, great.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.816
Uh, sounds good.
I'll see you in a bit.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.144
Okay. Love you.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.444
Love you too, Mom.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.818
Oh, no, no, no.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.392
How much farther
do you want to go today?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.140
I don't know.
We should probably stop.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.395
The sun is going down.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.510
- Hello?
- Is Nick home?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.849
Yeah.
You want me to get him?

05:45.929 --> 05:46.976
No.

05:47.931 --> 05:48.978
Can you talk?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.194
Yeah.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.071
Is this about Diana?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.739
Look, I don't want to
do this on the phone.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.659
Can you meet me tomorrow at
The Bent Brick at 10:00 a.m.?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.411
I think so.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.454
I assume I'm not supposed
to tell Nick about this.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.952
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.371
I'll see you in the morning.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.836
Any luck?

06:14.124 --> 06:16.092
Sort of.
You got the door open?

06:16.835 --> 06:17.882
Yeah.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.338
What'd you find?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.469
More tunnel, I think.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.829
I'll have to check it out later.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.181
Well, I got to take a shower.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.242
Man, you're alive!

07:32.494 --> 07:33.996
Good morning, gentlemen.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.672
Not that it's good.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.170
The guy being treated
is Doyle Baske, 28.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.717
He told paramedics he was on
his way to visit his mom,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.546
when he blew a tire, and
drove his car into a tree.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.759
Well, it didn't happen
around here.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.388
Mr. Baske said
he was going to get help

07:48.468 --> 07:50.228
when he was attacked
by a guy with a big dog.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.310
Got away, fell down a hill,
was found by a trucker,

07:53.390 --> 07:54.983
who nearly ran him over
this morning.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.528
Paramedics did find scratches and
bite marks when they treated Doyle,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.613
but not dog bites.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.157
More like human.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.286
Which is why I called you, since
I'm not an expert on human bites.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.489
They also said Doyle had a lot of
blood on him when they got here,

08:08.571 --> 08:11.666
but aside from the cut on his
forehead, they found no major wounds.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.869
So, where'd all that
blood come from?

08:13.952 --> 08:14.953
Exactly.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.413
No, I said I'm fine.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.082
We can't tell if there's any
internal bleeding or head trauma

08:19.165 --> 08:20.605
unless we take you
into the hospital.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.260
I'm not going in.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.133
Doyle Baske?
I'm Detective Burkhardt.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.759
This is Detective Griffin.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.725
Look, guys, I got attacked
by a guy and his dog. Okay?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.268
I didn't get a good look
at them.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.970
I got away,
I must have hit my head.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.226
I don't know. I'd just blown
a tire and hit a tree.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.273
Can we see some
identification please?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.520
Yeah, sure.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.720
What kind of work do you do?

08:38.727 --> 08:39.727
Commercial real estate.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.770
My office is downtown.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.236
And you were on your way
to visit your mom?

08:44.315 --> 08:45.316
Yeah, last night.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.236
I try to get out to see her,
like, once a month.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.537
She lives alone. Dad died
a couple of years ago.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.864
And where are you
headed now?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.949
I was just going back
to where I left my car.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.875
Oh, we can give you a ride,

08:54.951 --> 08:57.500
if you don't mind us asking you
a few questions on the way.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.380
Yeah, I can do that.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.547
Just make sure that
I get all results...

09:03.626 --> 09:04.718
Yeah.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.581
You're lucky you walked
away from this.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.960
Is this where
you were attacked?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.538
No, it's somewhere down there.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.966
I was trying to make a call
but didn't have any signal.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.047
I don't remember
where exactly.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.844
I just remember
this dog coming at me,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.638
and everything after
that's kind of a blur.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.674
I ran into the woods,

09:51.549 --> 09:53.677
and guess I just ended up
where I ended up.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.683
Unconscious in
the middle of the road?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.973
Yeah.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.770
Look, it was dark, I don't
know where I was going.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.692
I just know that I was trying
to get the hell out of there.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.112
Not to mention the fact that I had
just driven my car into a tree,

10:04.187 --> 10:06.906
so please forgive me if I wasn't
exactly thinking straight.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.701
Well, you might have
a concussion, you know.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.780
Yes.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.361
And I will get myself
checked out, I swear,

10:11.444 --> 10:12.991
but right now, I just
need to get to my mother.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.449
She's probably
worried sick about me.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.375
Do you remember
what kind of dog it was?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.865
You know what? I don't.
I'm not really a big dog guy.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.127
It was big, it was hairy,
and it was a dog, okay?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.468
We'll drive you to your mom's, you
can call a tow truck from there.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.842
Thank you, let me just
get my briefcase.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.733
Thanks for coming.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.486
So,

10:49.566 --> 10:51.409
this is Kelly.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.203
What do you know
about Diana?

10:56.406 --> 10:57.407
You look good.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.458
So do you.
Tell me about Diana.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.585
You remember Meisner?

11:05.957 --> 11:07.334
I've seen him.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.919
I know he's here.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.303
Wait, you've seen him,
and he hasn't told you?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.596
Told me what?

11:13.214 --> 11:14.636
He was in the helicopter
that night.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.094
He killed the King
and got Diana.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.309
Meisner has Diana?

11:20.388 --> 11:21.981
I said he got her,
not that he has her.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.182
Then who does?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.609
I'm not exactly sure yet,
but he told me that

11:24.684 --> 11:25.981
she was handed over
to the Resistance.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.233
Meisner assured me
that she was safe.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.694
And you haven't seen her?

11:30.773 --> 11:31.774
No.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.112
But what's important is that our
daughter is alive and safe.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.412
And not with the Royals.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.080
I want to see her.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.116
Well, so do I, but we're
gonna have to be patient.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.786
I've been patient.
I want her back.

11:46.414 --> 11:50.089
Well, that's interesting.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.259
Does Nick know?
No.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.299
Are you gonna tell him?

11:55.632 --> 11:56.975
I don't know.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.643
And you can't tell him.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.436
This feels very familiar.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.104
I'm serious, Sean.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.397
If Nick finds out that
you're a Hexenbiest again,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.100
things may not turn out
so well.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.152
We have a son together.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.946
And we have
a daughter together.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.819
Well, maybe I should
live with both of you.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.070
Wouldn't that be fun?

12:15.318 --> 12:17.946
Don't forget what happened to the
last Hexenbiest he lived with.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.077
I'm not Juliette.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.659
I know. I just...

12:24.202 --> 12:26.546
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.672
And I don't want anything
to happen to you.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.444
Hey, guys, I'd, uh...

12:58.528 --> 13:00.451
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
say anything to my mother

13:00.530 --> 13:01.827
about me getting attacked.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.412
I don't want her
to get freaked out.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.960
Okay, but we're gonna
need your shirt.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.036
Excuse me?

13:08.079 --> 13:09.706
Some of the blood on that
might not be yours.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.383
We can use it to help identify
whoever attacked you.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.085
Yeah, okay.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.216
Oh, that's my mom.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.936
Mom.
Oh, my God!

13:24.012 --> 13:25.212
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.264
I know.
What happened?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.348
Your shirt.
Yeah.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.524
Is that blood?
Are you injured?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.567
It looks worse
than it is, I swear.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.190
Oh, god.
My car had a flat tire

13:32.270 --> 13:33.362
and it went off the road,
but I'm fine.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.317
These two police detectives,
they gave me a ride.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.776
I'm sorry, I don't
remember your names.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.863
No problem. I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.909
You gave me quite a scare.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.411
I know,
and I'm sorry. I...

13:44.490 --> 13:47.209
I tried to call but
my phone had no service.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.445
I want to find out if you
called the police last night,

13:49.495 --> 13:50.587
when he didn't show up.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.789
No, I didn't.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.501
I thought he was late
or just stuck at the office.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.712
Yeah. Well, thank you,
guys, for the ride.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.915
We need to get
a hold of you.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.049
Oh, yeah, of course.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.850
This is my card,
number's on it.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.051
Just give me a call.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.188
Your shirt?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.606
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
my mom in the house

14:08.681 --> 14:10.433
and then I'll run it
right back out, okay?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.193
That strike you
as a little weird?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.316
What?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.435
He didn't want his mom to
know that he was attacked.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.386
My mom lived out here
by herself,

14:18.441 --> 14:19.681
and I was attacked
not far away,

14:19.734 --> 14:22.362
I'd want her to know, so she
could, at least, lock the doors.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.537
Or maybe he'll tell her later.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.973
After he gets off
his bloody shirt.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.289
Here you go.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.037
Thanks again.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.671
No priors for Doyle.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.845
The Doyle family is pretty
old money, for Portland.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.672
They've owned that property
where his mother's living

14:40.755 --> 14:42.052
since the late 1800s.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.758
Looks like he's been
at the same real estate firm

14:43.841 --> 14:45.218
for the last five years.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.644
He's single, no dependents.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.437
And yet he winds up
bloody on his way

14:48.513 --> 14:51.141
over the hills and through
the woods to mother's house.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.192
Got the lab work back
on the blood samples

14:53.267 --> 14:54.484
taken from
your victim's shirt.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.561
Any dog?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.739
No dog, all human.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.237
But you were thinking there were
two types, victim and attacker?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.445
Yeah. According to him, he was
attacked by an assailant and his dog.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.654
Well, then it's kind of
hard to explain

15:04.737 --> 15:05.977
the three different
blood types,

15:06.030 --> 15:07.657
when none of them are canine.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.414
So, he was attacked
by two humans and no dog?

15:10.493 --> 15:11.995
Doesn't mean he wasn't
attacked by a dog.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.625
Just that the dog
didn't bleed.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.876
Or the dog was Wesen.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.093
So, we've got a man and his
Wesen loose in the woods?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.544
Maybe.
Check area hospitals.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.755
See if anybody came in
with bite wounds,

15:21.838 --> 15:23.932
uh, between sundown
and this morning.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.555
Yep. You might want to
call Monroe and Rosalee.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.056
I think we better
go back out there

15:28.136 --> 15:30.264
and see if we can
retrace Doyle's steps.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.953
This is where he ran off
the road, hit the tree.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.996
Uh, he said he went off
in this direction.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.374
His mother's house is about
three miles down the road.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.590
Okay, let me have it.

16:10.761 --> 16:11.978
I don't know how you do that.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.055
It'd make me gag.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.107
All right. I got it.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.736
And yes,
it would make you gag.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.694
I'll follow in the car.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.415
Rachel.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.247
Yes?
Are you alone?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.503
Lam.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.676
Have you gotten a commitment?

16:41.751 --> 16:43.003
Not yet.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.337
He's being very careful.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.013
Mmm. As expected.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.809
But now you must persuade him that
it is the right and only decision.

16:49.884 --> 16:50.931
I understand.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.102
Good.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.213
Hold On.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.299
I think...

17:33.469 --> 17:35.142
I think he went off the road.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.973
You picking up
on anything else?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.899
Like the guy
who attacked him or his dog?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.561
Uh-uh.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.275
Just Doyle so far.

17:53.656 --> 17:54.953
He still got Doyle?

17:55.032 --> 17:56.875
He thinks this is
where he went off the road.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.500
I thought Doyle said he was
attacked somewhere on the road.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.122
Yeah.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.525
Guys.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.695
I got something new.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.069
I mean,
in addition to Doyle.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.653
Oh.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.154
I smell it, too.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.664
What is it?

20:41.824 --> 20:42.825
Death.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.635
Doyle definitely wasn't lying
about there being an attack.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.345
Yeah.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.055
But who attacked whom?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.494
Maybe these two were
attacked by the guy and his dog, too?

21:15.316 --> 21:16.784
No.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.861
No dog did this.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.209
It smells somewhat
Blutbad-ian, but not quite.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.412
Doyle said
he was attacked by a dog.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.794
So, either he saw a Wesen,
or he's lying.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.528
Scent's
in this direction.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.920
If they match, these two
bodies would explain

21:36.003 --> 21:37.243
the three different
blood types.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.558
Looks like they were
cross-country hiking.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.900
A James Kriminski.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.236
From Tillamook.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.023
Looks like his credit cards
and cash are still here.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.074
Same here.
Also from Tillamook.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.989
514 North Adams.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.161
Yeah,
that's what I've got.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.580
Must be his wife.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.202
Daphne Kriminski.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.704
I'll call it in.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.758
Wait a minute.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.297
What?

22:20.381 --> 22:23.931
This is the trail, right?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.055
I mean, they would've
been on the trail,

22:28.138 --> 22:29.890
if you're walking
in the woods at night.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.604
Yeah. People do that.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.107
Especially when
there's a full moon.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.198
Well, there was
a full moon last night.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.946
That's what I'm saying.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.444
This wasn't a Blutbad.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.622
Looks like there's blood
on his teeth.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.375
Might explain the
human bite marks Doyle had.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.080
Nick, Hank.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.757
Look,
this is just a hunch,

22:55.916 --> 22:57.213
but last night
was a full moon.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.920
Technically, it was the first
night of the full moon.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.728
'Cause there's three
nights of full moon.

23:00.963 --> 23:01.964
We could be dealing with,

23:02.047 --> 23:03.845
and I don't want
anybody to panic,

23:04.967 --> 23:06.014
a Lycanthrope.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.641
Oh, my God.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.098
Is that a Wesen?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.064
Yes and no.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.701
That's a Lycanthrope.

23:23.819 --> 23:24.945
Is it a disease?

23:25.029 --> 23:27.748
Yeah!
It's a Wesen disease.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.416
Specific to Blutbaden.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.414
"Lycanthropia is
a genetic mutation

23:31.493 --> 23:34.087
"which presents itself
on rare occasion in Blutbaden.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.040
"It's transmitted
as a recessive trait

23:36.123 --> 23:37.523
"which rarely affects
the offspring.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.635
"When Lycanthropia
manifests physically,

23:40.210 --> 23:43.339
"it's only during the three
nights of the full moon."

23:44.506 --> 23:46.226
- Are we talking werewolves?
- In a way.

23:48.093 --> 23:52.894
It's a condition that makes
Blutbaden temporarily insane.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.941
And if anybody was to encounter
one during a full moon,

23:55.017 --> 23:56.769
they would've definitely thought
they were dealing with one.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.525
I heard stories growing up

23:58.604 --> 24:00.447
about Blutbaden families
that would kill

24:00.522 --> 24:02.741
their own children if
they developed symptoms.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.284
So, I thought this disease
had been wiped out,

24:04.360 --> 24:05.361
like, 100 years ago.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.954
And do we think Doyle
is the Lycanthrope?

24:08.030 --> 24:08.997
I'll tell you
one thing.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.120
It ain't the two bodies
we found

24:10.199 --> 24:12.543
because nobody is taking
down two Lycanthropes

24:12.618 --> 24:15.713
under a full moon without,
like, a bazooka.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.707
Well, is there a cure?

24:18.582 --> 24:21.131
I don't think so,
but I'll check.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.838
Well, whoever
this Lycanthrope is,

24:23.921 --> 24:25.601
if they're affected
during the full moon...

24:25.631 --> 24:27.725
Then we've got
two more nights of this.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.895
And if it is Doyle,
he'll kill again tonight.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.808
Doyle said he was
attacked by a man and his dog.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.814
But we found the body of a
man and a woman, no dog.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.520
How'd you find them?
We followed their scent.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.729
Did you use dogs?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.156
No.
We used Monroe.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.325
We're not gonna tell that
to the DA, are we?

24:44.608 --> 24:47.031
Monroe is convinced that we're
dealing with a Lycanthrope.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.158
You've heard of them?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.205
Yeah. It's the basis
for the werewolf myth.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.329
And tonight will be the second of
three nights of the full moon.

24:53.409 --> 24:57.334
So we're thinking, if Doyle is a
Lycanthrope, we bring him in, lock him up.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.414
See what happens.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.840
And what if it's not him?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.383
He's from an old family.
They're well connected.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.756
You might open yourselves up
to false arrest, or worse.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.133
And what if we're right?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.340
Then you'll be dealing with a
raving Lycanthrope in a jail cell.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.471
Better than on the street.

25:09.550 --> 25:10.676
We can isolate.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.285
If he's what you think he is,
his mother would know about it.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.891
Could be why he was out there
last night, to deal with this.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.851
Probably why he didn't stick
around to deal with the car.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.318
All right, go ahead,
just don't charge him.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.221
Hold him overnight, I guess
you'll know in a few hours.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.815
Yeah.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.860
Got the lab report back
on the Kriminskis.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.532
Blood types matched
those found on Doyle's shirt.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.376
We've got three hours
until it gets dark.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.123
Okay, bring him in.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.341
So, this is Wesen?

25:46.420 --> 25:47.420
Yeah.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.840
What are we dealing with?

25:48.922 --> 25:50.390
A Lycanthrope.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.467
What is that?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.969
Like a Blutbad on steroids.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.807
Make sure the isolation cell is
available, we're gonna use it.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.226
Question.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.175
What happens
when we lock him up

26:03.187 --> 26:04.313
and he turns into
a Lycanthrope,

26:04.396 --> 26:07.070
and raises hell for 12 hours?

26:07.149 --> 26:09.777
Might draw a little attention
to himself, don't you think?

26:10.819 --> 26:14.323
Well as soon as we know he's the
Lycanthrope, we knock him out.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.908
We?

26:15.991 --> 26:17.493
With what?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.586
I got nothing. You?

26:23.665 --> 26:24.757
No.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.176
I don't think there's a cure.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.512
Oh, no, there's a cure.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.931
It's called the parents
taking any child

26:31.006 --> 26:33.100
suspected of being
a Lycanthrope

26:33.175 --> 26:34.893
and burying them alive.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.847
It's Nick.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.932
I hope he's not calling
for the cure.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.566
Hey, dude. There's no cure.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.276
Okay.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.700
We're going to arrest him, put him
in a cell, hold him until morning.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.072
That'll be a fun night.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.778
Once we know
he's a Lycanthrope,

26:52.861 --> 26:54.454
we're gonna need
to sedate him.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.833
Oh. That I could do. A dose
of Schlaftrunk should do it.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.000
Double dose.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.874
This is a Lycanthrope.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.685
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Baske,

27:24.768 --> 27:26.065
but we need
to talk to your son.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.522
Does this have to do
with the accident?

27:27.604 --> 27:30.107
Yes, ma'am, we need to ask
Doyle a few questions.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.868
May we come in?

27:32.943 --> 27:34.069
I'll get him for you.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.712
You don't think
she's warning him, do you?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.326
I doubt it.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.209
We're not supposed to
know about Lycanthropes.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.254
Well, if the sun goes down,

27:44.329 --> 27:48.459
I don't think it matters what
they think we know, I think.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.465
Hello.
Hi.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.297
Did you find something out
about the guy who attacked me?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.429
We did, but we need you to come
down to the Precinct with us.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.269
There are some photos
we need you to take a look at.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.013
I'm sorry, it'll have
to wait until tomorrow.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.063
I have dinner plans tonight.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.891
Mr. Baske, this can't wait.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.778
Okay, I don't think you understand,
I can't leave here tonight.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.025
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to insist.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.777
Okay.
What is this all about?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.029
We're investigating
a double homicide,

28:13.108 --> 28:14.701
and we think the same
individual responsible

28:14.776 --> 28:16.369
for attacking your
son attacked them.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.413
But didn't you hear him?
He can't go.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.456
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll have him back by 7:00.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.202
That's too late.
It's okay, Mom.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.377
Let me just grab my jacket.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.882
You need to leave
the door open, ma'am.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.459
Okay, this is ridiculous.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.379
I'm calling my lawyer.
Where is he going?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.430
What is he doing?

28:35.672 --> 28:36.844
He's running!

28:38.467 --> 28:39.969
This is private property!

28:59.780 --> 29:01.373
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:01.448 --> 29:02.888
Come on, guys,
you cannot take me in.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.706
Why?

29:04.785 --> 29:06.345
Because my mother is
out here all alone.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.458
Why'd you run?

29:07.537 --> 29:08.584
Because I got attacked.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.961
You had just told me that
two people got murdered.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.587
Please, I have to be here!

29:16.964 --> 29:18.216
Stop it!

29:18.298 --> 29:20.141
He didn't do anything!

29:20.217 --> 29:21.685
Ma'am, stay out of this.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.440
And don't make it worse
than it already is.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.079
Yeah.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.739
Send her in.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.123
Thanks, Wu.
Yeah, sure.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.583
Hi.
Hi.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.088
Hope I'm not
interrupting too much.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.132
No, that's okay.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.758
I have something
I want to show you.

30:02.426 --> 30:06.476
Gallagher's poll numbers
are down 25%.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.432
Because of this.
Thanks to you.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.726
Let me make this clear.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.482
He did it.
And it was covered up.

30:12.561 --> 30:13.813
Yes, I understand.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.398
But we wouldn't have known about
it if it hadn't been for you.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.484
You didn't really
come here to thank me.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.486
Sean,
we're running out of time.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.164
You need to commit. You're
either in or you're out.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.537
You can win this.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.414
And a whole lot more.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.255
Maybe I'm happy where I am.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.584
You need to be on
the right side of history.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.222
What are you doing?

30:48.305 --> 30:49.898
Why are you
putting me in here?

30:49.973 --> 30:52.351
Well, you ran. Now we've
got to write up a report.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.651
Are you charging me?

30:55.062 --> 30:56.109
We don't know yet.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.366
I thought you wanted me to
look at some photographs.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.817
We'll get there.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.250
We should know
in about 15 minutes.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.176
You got the tranquillizer?
Right here.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.891
Yeah, but it's gonna take about
five minutes to really take effect.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.839
How are we gonna
get it into him?

31:22.923 --> 31:24.721
- Crossbow.
- Four darts.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.302
Yeah.
That'll work.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.059
- Yeah?
- I need to talk to you.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.939
Eve.
I'm in the parking garage.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.065
Bring Hank.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.145
I won't be here long.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.861
That was Eve?
Yeah.

31:40.941 --> 31:41.988
What does she want?

31:42.067 --> 31:43.068
I don't know.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.619
She said she wanted to talk.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.492
Are you sure
you want to do this alone?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.291
Considering what happened
at the restaurant?

31:48.365 --> 31:49.867
She wants to
talk to you, too.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.043
Okay.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.633
What do you want?

32:08.218 --> 32:09.435
Did you know about this?

32:12.514 --> 32:13.686
What the hell is that?

32:14.516 --> 32:15.893
Campaign poster.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.441
Captain running for mayor?
Is that real?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.522
- It's real.
- Where'd you get that?

32:20.605 --> 32:21.777
You don't need to know that.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.197
It's a shipping label.
So what?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.702
Look at the date.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.249
The 15th.
Is that supposed to mean something?

32:35.328 --> 32:37.956
It was shipped four days before
Andrew Dixon was assassinated.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.667
Which means it was printed
some time before that.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.759
Are you saying that
the Captain knew about this?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.341
I don't know, but somebody
involved in Dixon's campaign did.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.218
Who?

32:49.301 --> 32:50.553
Rachel Wood.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.059
Dixon's Media
Relations Director.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.672
No, she can't be the only one.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.283
We need to find out
whether Renard knew.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.694
Renard couldn't have known.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.146
He was standing
right next to the guy.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.789
I've seen the tapes,
I saw his reaction.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.576
There's no way he could've
seen this coming.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.280
No.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.362
But does he know now.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.166
What did Eve want?

33:17.245 --> 33:19.964
HW thinks that someone
inside Dixon's campaign

33:20.040 --> 33:21.838
knew he was gonna
be assassinated.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.089
What?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.387
Oh, my God.
So we're talking conspiracy?

33:25.462 --> 33:26.588
Maybe.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.514
Not that
I'm not interested in,

33:28.590 --> 33:30.388
you know, conspiracy,
but it's night now.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.969
So, we should be doing this.

33:32.469 --> 33:33.561
Let's go.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.029
I think we can start with one.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.747
That should be enough.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.570
Okay.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.198
What the hell?

33:55.951 --> 33:56.952
Oh.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.536
What?

33:58.620 --> 34:00.088
- Wu.
- Hey, where are you?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.255
I just found out
they bailed out Doyle.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.583
Yeah, I know,
we're at his cell.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.714
How long ago?
Just a few minutes ago.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.552
He could still be
in the building.

34:06.628 --> 34:07.845
That's what I'm thinking.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.389
Put that back.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.353
Doyle!
I've been bailed out.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.725
I don't know what
the hell you're doing.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.605
Exit interview.
Hey, get your hands off of me.

34:18.681 --> 34:19.978
I said I've been bailed out!

34:20.058 --> 34:21.355
In here.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.811
You don't understand.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.065
- I have to leave!
- We're not too late.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.487
He hasn't woged yet.

34:26.188 --> 34:27.235
Oh, my God,
what the hell is that?

34:27.315 --> 34:28.567
Take him down.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.411
Take him down, now!

34:31.485 --> 34:32.658
He's not a Lycanthrope!

34:37.701 --> 34:39.123
You know?
Yeah, we do.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.250
But you are not what
we thought you were.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.127
Okay. If he's not the Lycanthrope,
then who the hell is?

34:43.206 --> 34:45.049
Are you sure we're looking
for a Lycanthrope?

34:45.125 --> 34:46.752
I'm sure.
Yeah, but he's not it.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.052
You don't understand.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.348
It's his mother.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.593
You said it was
a dog that attacked you.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.744
I said that to protect her.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.454
What else could I say?

35:23.371 --> 35:25.624
I knew exactly
what was gonna happen.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.254
Iran as fast as I could,

35:27.334 --> 35:29.883
and then I heard the screams,
but I got there too late.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.048
She was attacking those two
people, and I tried to stop her,

35:33.131 --> 35:35.975
but I couldn't,
that is how I got so bloody.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.890
But then she came after me.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.314
So, I ran towards the highway,

35:41.389 --> 35:43.483
I fell down an
embankment, I must've hit my head.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.777
I don't remember anything
that happened after that.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.321
But listen, if you guys know
what a Lycanthrope is,

35:48.396 --> 35:50.069
then you know what
lam talking about.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.821
My mother cannot
stop herself,

35:51.900 --> 35:53.618
she doesn't know
what she's doing.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.488
And I have got
to get back out there

35:56.571 --> 35:59.245
or she will kill again.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.332
There's a room downstairs that she
will have tried to lock herself in.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.709
It didn't work
so good last night.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.037
She didn't know that I wasn't
gonna be here last night.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.292
Give me the crossbow.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.380
Hey, you can't shoot
my mother with that.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.584
It's a tranquilizer.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.760
It'll just knock her out.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.512
I hope.

36:54.587 --> 36:55.679
Fine.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.223
Stay out here. Just in case.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.274
No, no, no, no, no!

37:13.148 --> 37:14.320
We're too late.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.656
Without the door being barred
from the outside,

37:16.735 --> 37:19.363
there was no way that this
room was gonna contain her.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.336
I don't think
she's in the house anymore.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.043
You heard it, too.
Yeah.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.503
It came from that direction.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.343
We going out there?
You guys...

37:38.631 --> 37:40.929
Look, please, this is my mother.
You cannot shoot her.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.135
She's hunting again.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.437
What do you not understand?
She can't help it.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.640
Tell that to the two people
she killed last night.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.843
I'll try to tranquilize her,

37:48.850 --> 37:50.067
but if that doesn't work...

37:52.645 --> 37:53.897
Let's go.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.612
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.629
We just crossed her path.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.557
This way.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.303
Oh, yeah.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.981
She is really strong here.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.445
Doyle's not here.
He's gone.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.657
He's gonna warn his mom.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.279
You don't warn a Lycanthrope.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.075
Want me to go back after him?

38:44.572 --> 38:45.915
I'll go with you.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.584
Here.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.578
Let's go.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.258
At least we've got
a full moon.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.057
Yeah, well,
that's the problem.

39:08.805 --> 39:09.931
Wait.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.937
I hear something.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.121
Where the hell did you go?

39:33.955 --> 39:35.081
- Run.
- Wu!

39:35.164 --> 39:36.211
Over here!

39:39.460 --> 39:40.677
Hank!

39:40.753 --> 39:42.300
She must have circled back.

39:47.594 --> 39:48.641
Wu, watch out!

39:48.720 --> 39:49.721
Coming your way!

40:12.660 --> 40:13.786
- Tranquilizer, now!
- No.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.918
It doesn't take
immediate effect.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.465
It'll just provoke her.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.549
Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.630
It's me. It's Doyle.
It's your son.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.676
It's okay, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.137
I've got this.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.977
Mom, you're not gonna hurt me.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.308
No, no, no!

40:42.982 --> 40:44.029
on, my God!

40:50.406 --> 40:51.749
I'm sorry.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.356
Mom.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.776
Mom.
