WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.086
- In the most intense season
of <i> Ink Master</i> yet,

00:04.170 --> 00:07.257
every artist came into this
competition with a rival--

00:07.340 --> 00:10.802
some seeking revenge,
some looking for respect,

00:10.885 --> 00:13.722
and some wanting to settle
their differences.

00:13.805 --> 00:17.767
Tonight one artist will walk
away with $100,000,

00:17.851 --> 00:20.729
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

00:20.812 --> 00:23.773
and, most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.235
It's all happening right now
on <i> Ink Master Live.</i>

00:27.318 --> 00:31.573
[cheers and applause]

00:31.656 --> 00:33.742
male announcer:
This season on <i> Ink Master,</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:38.872
18 rival artists were fighting
to settle the score.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.290
- Stop being a pussy, man!

00:40.373 --> 00:41.916
If you're my competitor,
give me a fight!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.835
{\an8}announcer:
Proving once and for all

00:43.918 --> 00:47.964
{\an8}that they are better
than their rival.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.466
- I have shown that I have
the heart and the [bleep] right

00:49.549 --> 00:51.801
to deserve to be here.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.595
- It will be a bloodbath,
and I'm going to end up

00:53.678 --> 00:54.971
mopping the floor with his ass.

00:55.054 --> 00:58.224
announcer: They faced off
in extreme challenges.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.810
- The smell of blood smells
like money to me.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.853
- This whole flesh challenge

01:01.936 --> 01:04.813
went from really naked
to really nerve-racking.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.149
- Whoo!

01:06.232 --> 01:09.986
announcer:
Old and new rivalries ignited

01:10.069 --> 01:12.071
the most explosive season yet.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.490
- Talk to me about it.
- I'm talking to you!

01:13.573 --> 01:15.450
I'm talking to you.
- You ain't ever all that!

01:15.533 --> 01:16.451
I've seen your [bleep] work.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.286
- [bleep] you mother[bleep].

01:18.369 --> 01:20.205
- Come here!
- You mother[bleep]!

01:20.288 --> 01:24.334
announcer: And one by one,
they were eliminated.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.378
- Your drawing is not up to par
to win this thing.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.671
- Quit shaking
your [bleep] head.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.759
You unprovokedly told him
to go [bleep] himself.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.637
- You should feel incredibly
lucky that there's people

01:35.720 --> 01:37.013
that are just worse than you.

01:37.096 --> 01:41.267
- I sincerely hope that this is
not everybody's best work.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.852
- Caroline, LT, Jayvo,

01:42.936 --> 01:43.645
Tim, Ryan, Robbie,

01:43.728 --> 01:45.522
Ty'esha, Angel, Julia,

01:45.605 --> 01:48.399
Emily, Josh, Don,

01:48.483 --> 01:49.484
Aaron, Cris, Mark,

01:49.567 --> 01:52.487
none of you have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

01:52.570 --> 01:56.241
announcer: Tonight on the live
season finale of <i> Ink Master.</i>

01:56.324 --> 01:58.993
- Cleen and Jason think they
can take me out?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.119
They got another thing coming.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.038
announcer:
Three artists remain--

02:02.121 --> 02:04.415
Erik, Jason, and Cleen.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.708
- This is the best tattoo
of my career.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.794
That title is mine.

02:07.877 --> 02:12.131
announcer:
Only one will earn $100,000...

02:12.215 --> 02:14.133
- I'm gonna show the world
that I am the next Ink Master.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.887
announcer:
...and the title of Ink Master.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.306
[cheers and applause]

02:26.145 --> 02:28.565
{\an8}- It's the
<i>Ink Master: Rivals</i> finale

02:28.648 --> 02:32.569
{\an8}coming to you live
from New York City.

02:32.652 --> 02:36.322
{\an8}As always, I'm joined
by Mr. Oliver Peck...

02:36.406 --> 02:40.034
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

02:40.118 --> 02:42.745
{\an8}...and, of course,
Mr. Chris Nuñez.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.291
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

02:49.168 --> 02:51.754
<i>Ink Master</i> would not be
complete without the artists

02:51.838 --> 02:53.089
that put their work on the line
every week.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.884
And tonight we'll talk
to the artists

02:55.967 --> 02:56.634
that were defeated this season.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.096
What's up, guys?

03:00.179 --> 03:04.851
[cheers and applause]

03:04.934 --> 03:07.729
And last season's
fan favorite, Sausage,

03:07.812 --> 03:13.443
is tattooing right now.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.321
Right on, man.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.698
We'll check in with him
in just a moment.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.450
But first, three artists remain.

03:20.533 --> 03:26.372
And tonight one of them will
walk away with $100,000.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.792
[cheers and applause]

03:31.419 --> 03:34.464
Please welcome...

03:34.547 --> 03:36.549
Erik Siuda...

03:36.633 --> 03:39.594
[cheers and applause]

03:49.896 --> 03:50.647
Cleen Rock One...

03:50.730 --> 03:55.026
[cheers and applause]

04:07.038 --> 04:08.831
...and Jason Clay Dunn!

04:08.915 --> 04:12.835
[cheers and applause]

04:22.011 --> 04:24.639
Welcome
to the final battle, guys.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.307
It's been a long road.
Are y'all ready?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.017
all: Yep.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.602
- Right on.
Well, I got to tell you,

04:29.686 --> 04:32.230
social media has been buzzing
with speculation.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.858
{\an8}And one of our followers
tweeted...

04:39.946 --> 04:43.032
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

04:44.951 --> 04:46.369
{\an8}- Well, you know, I've been
a front-runner

04:46.452 --> 04:48.955
{\an8}the whole, entire competition,
and, uh,

04:49.038 --> 04:51.165
{\an8}you know, I've been
very consistent, and, uh--

04:51.249 --> 04:53.084
{\an8}and, I mean, honestly,
Jason's been at the bottom

04:53.167 --> 04:54.544
{\an8}more than he's been
at the top,

04:54.627 --> 04:55.878
{\an8}so I don't even know
how he got here.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.714
{\an8}- Wow.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
{\an8}Jason, what do you say to that?

04:59.298 --> 05:01.551
{\an8}- I definitely earned
my place here,

05:01.634 --> 05:04.387
{\an8}I mean, I've had more overall
wins than these guys think.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.306
{\an8}Pfft, I mean, Erik, he never
even had an overall win.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.392
{\an8}This guy slid by the whole,
entire time.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.187
{\an8}- Wow. Fighting words, Erik.
- It's just a fact.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.731
{\an8}- Jason, you're
so full of it, bro.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.190
I've proven time and time again
I'm a force to be reckoned with.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.401
- Yeah.
- dude, you should've been--

05:18.484 --> 05:20.528
you should've been knocked off
three to four times...

05:20.611 --> 05:21.529
easily.
- Whatever.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.240
- Wow. Wow. Things are still
heated up here.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.159
Let's get
a judges' perspective.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.287
Guys, how important
is consistency

05:29.370 --> 05:31.080
in a competition like this?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.707
- I'm gonna say
it's just as important

05:32.790 --> 05:34.208
as tattooing every day
in your shop.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.586
Your customers come in, they
rely on you to do good work.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.255
If you can't be consistent,
you're not going to make it.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.423
You're not going to make it
in this business

05:40.506 --> 05:41.758
over a long point of time,

05:41.841 --> 05:43.593
and in this competition,
you've got to be on top.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.927
- Chris?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.763
- It's constantly showing off
what you can do.

05:46.846 --> 05:47.930
It's your skills,
and it's repeating

05:48.014 --> 05:50.516
in all the styles so that
when we get to this point,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.227
we know exactly who's got it
in the bag.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.645
- Thanks, guys.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.231
Okay, Erik, Cleen, Jason,

05:57.315 --> 06:00.485
we've seen your work
all season long,

06:00.568 --> 06:04.322
and now there's one last tattoo
to reveal.

06:04.405 --> 06:08.076
And in the biggest
<i>Ink Master</i> canvas shake-up,

06:08.159 --> 06:10.119
strategy is coming into play,

06:10.203 --> 06:12.914
because as you know, your fellow
finalists chose the style

06:12.997 --> 06:15.708
of your back piece.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.710
Five sessions,

06:17.794 --> 06:20.588
35 hours of tattooing,

06:20.671 --> 06:23.591
it's time to see if your
competitive strategy paid off.

06:23.674 --> 06:24.592
Let's take a look.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.098
{\an8}- This is my second time
in this competition.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.475
{\an8}I have a lot more to prove
than Cleen and Erik.

06:32.558 --> 06:36.479
{\an8}I'm gonna show the world
I am the next Ink Master.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.106
{\an8}- Cleen and Jason think they
can take me out?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.315
{\an8}They got another thing coming.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.442
{\an8}I'm not leaving
without the $100,000.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.325
{\an8}- I am way more versatile than
Erik and Jason put together.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.743
{\an8}That title is mine.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.203
{\an8}And there it is.
- I love it.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.329
{\an8}- All right. Let's do it.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.331
{\an8}This is the largest
color-realism tattoo

06:55.414 --> 06:59.544
{\an8}I've ever done,
but I'm going to kill it.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.461
{\an8}- Whoa!

07:00.545 --> 07:01.003
{\an8}- Cleen doing the same style
as me

07:01.087 --> 07:02.171
{\an8}doesn't faze me at all.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.297
{\an8}I've wanted to take Cleen out

07:03.381 --> 07:04.715
{\an8}throughout
the whole competition,

07:04.799 --> 07:08.219
{\an8}and this is how I'm gonna do it,
with this final back piece.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.137
{\an8}- Go check it out.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.264
{\an8}I kept it really fun,
really playful.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.765
Cleen and Erik thought that they
would trip me up

07:12.849 --> 07:14.100
by giving me new school,
but I'm still gonna infuse

07:14.183 --> 07:16.644
my own style into this tattoo.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.646
I'm gonna knock this thing
out of the park.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.107
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.402
{\an8}[squeals]

07:24.485 --> 07:27.071
{\an8}- I really wish I would've got
the new-school back piece

07:27.155 --> 07:28.573
{\an8}that Jason got,

07:28.656 --> 07:29.657
{\an8}but no matter
what he's doing,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.868
{\an8}I'm gonna knock it
out of the park with this one.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.036
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.663
You ready for some more work
or what?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.957
- You know, I just feel like,
at this point,

07:38.040 --> 07:41.377
I'm not really wanting to
continue on with the tattoo.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.629
- Who starts
a 35-hour back piece

07:43.713 --> 07:45.006
and doesn't go through with it?

07:45.089 --> 07:45.840
- I didn't have time
to think about it.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.883
- It's $100,000
on the line, girl.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.384
I mean, you know,
you're killing me right now.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.636
I finally get here,
and it's, like,

07:50.720 --> 07:51.971
I got all this on the line.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.347
I don't know what to do, man.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.058
My anxiety is on level 11
right now.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.643
I'm screwed.

07:59.729 --> 08:03.274
I've come too far to let her
tap out right now.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.987
You want some water or something
to drink?

08:08.070 --> 08:11.741
{\an1}I have to get my canvas to sit
through the rest of this tattoo.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.992
[cell phone ringing]

08:13.075 --> 08:16.245
{\an8}- Hey, Dave.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.416
{\an8}You're telling me, dude.

08:20.499 --> 08:24.337
I feel like I'm having
a panic attack.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.591
- Nice to meet you.
- So glad to meet you.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.594
You ready for a tattoo today?
- Heck, yeah.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.350
[alarm beeping]

08:37.433 --> 08:38.934
- That's it.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.227
- Oh, wow.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.145
- That 100K has been mine
since day one.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.397
- This is awesome.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.107
- There is no way the judge is
going to look at this tattoo

08:45.191 --> 08:48.402
and not give me the win.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.987
- Wow, this is great.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.072
- I think
we got a winner here.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.949
- Yeah, this
is definitely gonna win.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.784
- That title is mine.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.787
[cheers and applause]

09:08.839 --> 09:12.551
- All right, guys, we are
moments away from revealing

09:12.635 --> 09:14.178
the master canvases.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.557
But first, America,
we need your help.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.475
You have one final chance
to vote tonight

09:19.558 --> 09:21.811
on the tattoos
that you're about to see.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.982
The votes from all season long
will be added to tonight's vote

09:26.065 --> 09:28.776
and the artist
with the most votes overall

09:28.859 --> 09:32.280
will be guaranteed a spot
in the final two.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.574
That means America chooses
one artist in the final two,

09:35.658 --> 09:38.035
and the judges
choose the other.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.706
And we are upping the stakes.

09:41.789 --> 09:47.253
For the first time ever, your
favorite artist will get $10,000

09:47.336 --> 09:50.881
and, from Jack Daniel's,
a trip to their distillery

09:50.965 --> 09:53.050
to see just how
America's whiskey is made.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.345
Huh?
How about that?

09:56.429 --> 09:59.098
[cheers and applause]

10:13.571 --> 10:15.031

10:34.675 --> 10:37.470
All right, this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

10:37.553 --> 10:42.016
Let's bring out
your master canvases.

10:42.099 --> 10:45.227
[cheers and applause]

10:57.573 --> 10:59.408
Canvases, welcome.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.161
All right, Erik, step on up.

11:02.244 --> 11:06.207
Let's take a look
at your tattoo.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.257
- So I was assigned
photo-realism by my competitors,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.635
and my canvas wanted
a really tough tattoo.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.011
She wanted to do something

11:19.095 --> 11:21.097
that's part
of her favorite imagery,

11:21.180 --> 11:22.056
which is a human heart,

11:22.139 --> 11:24.975
so I did that morphing
into a human skull,

11:25.059 --> 11:26.811
with a raven on the top.

11:26.894 --> 11:27.937
And to soften it up
a little bit,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.772
to accentuate
her feminine side,

11:29.855 --> 11:33.442
I added nice roses
on the bottom.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.694
- All right. Thanks, Erik.
- Thank you.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.073
[cheers and applause]

11:42.660 --> 11:48.165
- Cleen.
Cleen, come on down, man.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.501
Let's take a look.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.799
- I was given photo-realism
and, you know,

11:56.882 --> 11:59.552
my guy's a mechanic,
and, you know, I'm a gearhead,

11:59.635 --> 12:02.471
and we just decided
to do some hot-rod stuff

12:02.555 --> 12:04.723
and a super badass skull.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.938
- Cool, man.
Thanks, Cleen.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.316
[cheers and applause]

12:17.361 --> 12:19.155
All right.
JCD, step on up.

12:19.238 --> 12:23.117
Let's see your tattoo.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.953
{\an8}- All right, my canvas--
I was given new school,

12:26.036 --> 12:29.373
{\an8}and I still wanted to add some
of my Japanese elements to it.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.168
{\an8}But, uh, I wanted to do
something positive, you know?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.378
I wanted to do something
positive that had, uh,

12:34.462 --> 12:38.340
kind of a snapshot of a young
child's imagination to it.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.302
[cheers and applause]

12:45.264 --> 12:48.517
- Second time you had to outline
that thing, right?

12:48.601 --> 12:49.685
Second time.
- Yes.

12:49.768 --> 12:54.190
- All right, buddy.
Thank you.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.358
Wow.

12:59.528 --> 13:03.032
All right, America,
voting is now open.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.640

{\an8}Up next, this season, there was
no shortage of bad blood.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.605
Which rivalries
are still burning?

13:34.688 --> 13:39.693
Plus, Sausage is tattooing live
right now.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.990
And we're going to catch up
with him when we come back,

13:45.074 --> 13:45.574
so don't go away.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.620
[cheers and applause]

13:59.380 --> 14:01.840
[cheers and applause]

14:10.057 --> 14:12.810
Welcome back to
<i>Ink Master: Rivals Live.</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:15.521
Remember, this is the time
to tweet your vote

14:15.604 --> 14:18.524
for the master canvas that you
think is the best,

14:18.607 --> 14:21.318
and get your favorite artist
one step closer

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
to the title of Ink Master.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.863
This season,
for the first time,

14:24.947 --> 14:29.326
every artist came into
the competition with a rival,

14:29.410 --> 14:31.787
and it changed
the entire lay of the land,

14:31.870 --> 14:36.041
and emotions ran higher
than every before.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.793
Let's take a look.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.214
{\an8}- Out of all the rivals here,
nobody can stand each other.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.425
{\an8}So I'm gonna put them together,
and see a [bleep]storm.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.551
{\an8}- You went a little too big.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.844
{\an8}- If I didn't do it right,
then you do it yourself.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.762
{\an8}- Angel's always hammering
me down.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.140
{\an8}He tries to take control
of everything that I'm doing.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.642
{\an8}- Cris Element was a little
backstabbing weasel,

14:53.726 --> 14:55.311
{\an8}and I'm here to seek revenge.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.812
I'm here to beat you,
I'm here to beat you,

14:56.895 --> 14:58.439
I'm here to beat them,
plain and simple!

14:58.522 --> 14:59.690
- You can throw what you want,
I'm gonna sit there and take

14:59.773 --> 15:01.483
what I got to take, and I still
don't think I'm going home,

15:01.567 --> 15:02.693
so [bleep] you both.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.112
{\an8}- Tim Lee's been running his
mouth for the past four years,

15:05.195 --> 15:06.113
{\an8}and I'm here to shut him up.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.531
{\an8}- My brother and I are rivals

15:07.615 --> 15:09.283
{\an8}because he doesn't think I take
tattooing seriously enough.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.660
- You are a sneaky,
bitch-ass liar!

15:11.744 --> 15:13.537
You mother[bleep]!

15:13.621 --> 15:14.538
- Wow.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.999
- So how was it working
together as rivals?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.084
- Honestly, it's a little
difficult to swallow.

15:19.168 --> 15:19.752
- You came here with a rival.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.879
If you can squash that beef

15:21.962 --> 15:24.089
and make a friend out of him,
take you a long way.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.801
- You lost a tattoo contest,
but you just won a brother.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.345
- God damn right.
- I'm in.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.640
[cheers and applause]

15:38.354 --> 15:40.814
- All right.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.859
Let's start off
with Robbie and Jayvo.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.362
Now, with you guys, it always
seems like a matter of respect

15:46.445 --> 15:47.905
more than anything else.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.740
How's the rivalry going now?

15:49.823 --> 15:50.908
{\an8}- Same way it was
before we came, man,

15:50.991 --> 15:52.284
{\an8}just went right back
to the same thing.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.411
{\an8}Keeps saying that
I'm a bad artist.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.538
{\an8}- That's a load of crap.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.040
{\an8}We both know that's a load
of crap.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.376
{\an8}I try to nurture and love
this fool.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.460
{\an8}I try to help him,
but he's too stubborn.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.004
{\an8}He don't want to hear it
from his little brother.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.673
{\an8}- Hence the two-hour phone call
when we got back,

16:05.756 --> 16:07.883
{\an8}and you told me
I'm not as good as I think I am.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.343
- That's true.
- I'm just over it, dude,

16:09.426 --> 16:10.719
I'm done with it. you know what?
- That's the truth!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.054
And you know what, buddy?
- You said you respect me.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.055
You have no respect, none.
- I love you.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.057
And I'm tired
of all your name-calling...

16:15.140 --> 16:15.641
- I love you too, bro.
- ...and all your problems,

16:15.724 --> 16:16.850
but you know what, dude?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.061
- Guys, guys, guys--
- How about this?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.229
Let's just love each other
and be brothers.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.815
- It's nice to see that
some things haven't changed.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.233
It's nice to see,
but we got to move it along.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.651
All right.
Ryan, I got to talk to you.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.735
- Yeah.
- Your rival, Mark,

16:26.819 --> 16:30.447
almost made it
to the entire finale.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.740
Was it hard for you
to watch that?

16:31.824 --> 16:32.950
I mean, he was your rival.

16:33.033 --> 16:33.992
{\an8}- I mean, me and Mark--
we squashed our beef,

16:34.076 --> 16:37.287
{\an8}and, you know,
I'm proud of him, honestly,

16:37.371 --> 16:39.248
{\an8}for everything he's done
and achieved.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.084
{\an8}I'm stoked at how far he got
in the competition, man.

16:42.167 --> 16:46.588
- Nice.
[cheers and applause]

16:46.672 --> 16:49.007
That is nice.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.928
Now, Mark was up for elimination
more times than any other artist

16:53.011 --> 16:54.930
in the history
of this competition.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.307
But...

16:57.391 --> 16:59.768
but he did keep hanging on.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.603
So, show of hands, let me see--

17:01.687 --> 17:05.022
how many of you guys thought you
would outlast Mark?

17:05.107 --> 17:06.608
- I still love you, guys.
[laughter]

17:06.692 --> 17:08.861
- Wow.
- I still love these guys.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.571
- Julia,
what's that smirk about?

17:11.655 --> 17:14.825
{\an8}- I just feel like I have so
much less experience than you,

17:14.907 --> 17:17.327
{\an8}and I out-tattooed you
so many times,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.747
{\an8}and there's just no way
you should have lasted

17:19.829 --> 17:23.125
{\an8}longer than me.
[audience shouting]

17:23.208 --> 17:25.419
{\an8}- I made it as far as I did
in this competition

17:25.502 --> 17:26.962
{\an8}'cause I deserve it.
- Mm.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.506
{\an8}- And you don't survive as long
as I did by being weak.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.091
{\an8}I'm a fighter,
and I love to tattoo.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.093
{\an8}If I could get back in there
and fight right now, I would.

17:33.177 --> 17:37.806
- I think you just got lucky.
- Mm-mm.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.225
- All right, guys,
we got to move on.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.685
Thank you.
- Thank you!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.312
- All right, let's check in

17:43.395 --> 17:47.066
{\an1}with last season's fan favorite,
Sausage, who's tattooing live.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.193
[cheers and applause]
- Sausage!

17:49.276 --> 17:51.195
- Buddy!

17:53.530 --> 17:55.032
Sausage!

17:55.115 --> 17:56.533
Tell us what you're doing
in there, man.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.494
{\an8}- In honor of the holidays,

17:58.577 --> 18:01.330
{\an8}I'm tattooing
this cute Christmas elf.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.373
{\an8}- Aw!
- Yeah, I know.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.375
She's very beautiful,
and I feel that she signifies

18:05.459 --> 18:06.585
the holiday spirit.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.837
- Right on, man.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.798
I'm gonna be over there
in a minute to take a look.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.383
[cheers and applause]

18:13.467 --> 18:15.844
All right.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.930
Special surprise here--

18:18.013 --> 18:20.974
<i>Ink Master</i> is celebrating
the holidays this year,

18:21.058 --> 18:25.437
as artists from past seasons
return to compete for $10,000.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.607
And here is a sneak peek.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.026
This is your shot
at <i> Ink Master</i> redemption.

18:31.109 --> 18:34.154
- Give me my Santa Claus money
right now!

18:34.238 --> 18:36.031
- After every
elimination tattoo,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.992
one of you
will be eliminated.

18:39.076 --> 18:39.868
- I just got to pull out
all the stops.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.246
- These people
have got to be nuts.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.541
- There's really no room
for error.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.334
- The money's mine.
The bragging rights are mine.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.461
The blowouts are yours.
- You have no chance.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.712
- New Year's is about putting

18:50.796 --> 18:52.631
the past behind you
and starting fresh.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.424
- I didn't come here
to [bleep] finish last.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.261
- I think you forgot how to
tattoo from last season to this.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.679
- If I see somebody walk
with that [bleep],

18:58.762 --> 19:00.347
I'm gonna laugh at that!
- 'Cause you're a dick!

19:00.430 --> 19:01.265
- You know the one thing
that's better

19:01.348 --> 19:04.059
than whipping somebody's ass
outright?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.520
A comeback.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.896
- Yeah!
- Yeah, man.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.773
[cheers and applause]

19:09.857 --> 19:11.066
Good to see you.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.442
That's looking good, buddy.
- Thank you.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.112
- Looking good.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.239
Easy to see why you're
the fan favorite.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.457
And up next,

19:27.541 --> 19:30.252
we'll talk about some
of the new, fierce rivalries

19:30.335 --> 19:31.253
that formed this season.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.715
And time is running out
to get your votes in,

[cheers and applause]

20:06.038 --> 20:08.582
- Welcome back
to <i> Ink Master: Rivals Live.</i>

20:08.665 --> 20:11.460
America, make sure
that you're voting.

20:11.543 --> 20:18.050
Tweet #INKERIK, #INKCLEEN,
or #INKJASON

20:18.133 --> 20:22.763
to guarantee one of these
finalists a spot in the top two.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.682
The audience tonight is filled

for the title of Ink Master,

20:27.434 --> 20:30.896
including season two artist
Sarah Miller.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.232
[cheers and applause]

20:36.818 --> 20:39.571
Sarah is also starring
in a special

20:39.655 --> 20:42.658
premiering
right after tonight's finale.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.828
<i>Ink Shrinks</i> showcases
the revolutionary concept

20:46.912 --> 20:48.664
of tattoo therapy,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.708
where clients
don't see their prescription

20:51.792 --> 20:53.877
until the tattoo is done.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.213
- Whoo!
- There you go.

20:56.296 --> 21:00.008
As any artist
who's competed can tell you,

21:00.092 --> 21:03.845
{\an1}with $100,000 on the line, new
rivalries flare up all the time.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.430
Let's take a look.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.100
{\an8}- All Cleen's been doing is
walking around being cutthroat

21:08.183 --> 21:09.685
{\an8}and telling everybody they suck.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.228
{\an8}You're a self-absorbed
ass[bleep]

21:11.311 --> 21:13.188
{\an8}that [bleep] with everyone.
- Oh, my God.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.690
{\an8}The only way that I'm [bleep]
with you right now,

21:14.773 --> 21:17.526
{\an8}is that I do better tattoos
than you, and you're threatened.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.945
{\an8}- I'm sick and tired of people
not respecting me.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.030
{\an8}Don't be mad because my tattoo's
better than yours.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.534
I know why I'm here!
I don't give a [bleep] about--

21:25.617 --> 21:27.577
[both shouting]
Yeah!

21:27.661 --> 21:28.870
- Yeah?
- What are you gonna do?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.539
I'm talking to you.
I'm talking to you.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.125
{\an8}- I'm going to kick Cris's
little, short, bow tie,

21:33.208 --> 21:34.251
{\an8}suspender-looking ass.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.669
{\an8}- Obviously, you don't know
how to draw.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.046
- I can scotch-tape a [bleep]
ear to the tattoo

21:38.130 --> 21:40.298
and still [bleep] win.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.883
- You might as well
just stop talking!

21:41.967 --> 21:43.552
- [bleep] you, mother[bleep].

21:43.635 --> 21:44.886
- Hey!
[all shouting]

21:44.970 --> 21:47.431
{\an8}- Emily is not better than me,
and I'm gonna prove it.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.934
- As soon as you get
on my level, then we can talk,

21:51.018 --> 21:52.978
but until then,
you can admire me from below!

21:53.061 --> 21:54.312
- You ain't even all that!
I've seen your work!

21:54.396 --> 21:57.774
- Who the [bleep] are you?
- It ain't [bleep]!

21:57.858 --> 21:59.568
- [bleep] your work.
[bleep] your face.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.610
- [bleep] you.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.947
[cheers and applause]

22:14.708 --> 22:17.586
- That was some intense stuff,
some intense stuff.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.462
Ty'esha, let me ask you--

22:18.545 --> 22:21.506
are you upset that Emily
outlasted you?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.758
{\an8}- Well, you know what?

22:22.841 --> 22:24.051
{\an8}I'm a better artist than Emily
could ever be.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.303
{\an8}- Whoa.
- You know, it's BS

22:26.386 --> 22:28.680
{\an8}that I was eliminated
before her.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.432
All she does is make
other female artists

22:30.515 --> 22:32.184
look like a bunch of wimps.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.269
[cheers and applause]

22:34.352 --> 22:35.604
- Wow.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.147
- You didn't play the game.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.648
You rolled over and gave up.

22:38.732 --> 22:42.611
{\an8}My desire and passion kept me
going through this competition

22:42.694 --> 22:44.154
{\an8}long after you left.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.698
You didn't take it seriously.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.867
You shouldn't even be talking
right now.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.703
I stayed in it much longer than
you, and I deserved to be.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.332
And for that matter, at least
I'm up front about my emotions,

22:55.415 --> 22:59.461
unlike some people
who--Josh--

22:59.544 --> 23:03.381
who will definitely smile at you
as he stabs you in the back.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.633
So that's my piece.
- Whoa.

23:04.716 --> 23:09.721
Josh, you seem a little unfairly
dragged into the catfight.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.806
Do you care to comment?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.015
{\an8}- Well, every time I instigated,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.476
{\an8}it had some sort of purpose
and was part of my strategy,

23:14.559 --> 23:17.854
{\an8}and you're just a crazy bitch
to be a crazy bitch.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.816
- Whoa!
[cheers and applause]

23:25.570 --> 23:28.115
Emily, you came in
with Aaron as a rival,

23:28.198 --> 23:31.993
{\an1}but, Aaron, you also developed
a rivalry of your own with Cris.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.830
In fact,
your elimination was the one

23:34.913 --> 23:35.664
that I was most upset about--

23:35.747 --> 23:38.041
#DAVEWASRIGHT.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.167
Care to comment?

23:39.251 --> 23:39.918
[laughter]

23:40.001 --> 23:42.170
{\an8}- I completely agree.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.255
{\an8}I don't I should've went out
when I did.

23:43.338 --> 23:46.383
{\an8}I don't think Cris even did
a portrait tattoo.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.218
{\an8}- Cris?
- Seriously, like, honestly,

23:48.301 --> 23:49.386
{\an8}your tattoo--you were sent home,

23:49.469 --> 23:52.514
{\an8}so, obviously,
you had the worst tattoo,

23:52.597 --> 23:55.517
{\an8}and even if you would've beat me
on portrait, or beat anybody,

23:55.600 --> 23:57.853
{\an8}there's no way you would've been
able to hang with them.

23:57.936 --> 23:58.854
- That's not even true.
- Wow.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.688
All right, guys,
I got to cut this off.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.566
I got to move on,
as I always do.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.859
When we come back,
voting will close,

24:03.942 --> 24:07.946
and the judges will finally
critique the master canvases,

24:08.029 --> 24:11.658
and one of these three artists
is about to lose his shot

24:11.741 --> 24:12.826
at the title of Ink Master.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.828
Don't go away.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.789
[cheers and applause]

24:23.962 --> 24:26.923
[cheers and applause]

24:31.219 --> 24:35.640
- All right, welcome back.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.560
Welcome back.
Thank you, thank you.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.688
All night long, you've been
voting on the master canvases,

24:41.771 --> 24:44.482
and now time is up.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.109
Voting is closed.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.446
We'll reveal the results of your
vote in just a few moments,

24:49.529 --> 24:52.407
but this is
the moment of truth,

24:52.490 --> 24:54.951
time to hear what the judges
have to say.

24:55.035 --> 24:58.079
Erik, you're up first.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.707
[cheers and applause]

25:05.879 --> 25:07.214
Ollie.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.132
- First of all, Erik, let me ask
you this question, man.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.759
In designing this
as a back piece,

25:10.842 --> 25:12.010
how do you feel you did

25:12.093 --> 25:14.221
about making it fit the shape
of the entire back?

25:14.304 --> 25:16.431
- I think I made it
a pretty dynamic shape.

25:16.514 --> 25:19.142
I didn't want to do it so
I encapsulated the whole thing.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.685
And if I had enough time,

25:20.769 --> 25:22.729
I was gonna do a whole
other background to it,

25:22.812 --> 25:24.481
but with photo-realism,
you're limited on time,

25:24.564 --> 25:26.399
because everything's
got to be precise.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.361
- It does kind of feel like
it has a floating-tattoo vibe,

25:29.444 --> 25:31.905
as opposed to, like,
a back piece,

25:31.988 --> 25:33.114
where it fits the shape.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.950
That being said,

25:35.033 --> 25:38.453
for color realism, it's kind of
hard for me to interpret.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.288
It's kind of
all over the place,

25:40.372 --> 25:41.623
and there's a lot
of messy spots in it.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.084
Up at the top,
the ventricles--they come out.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.919
There's not a lot
of dynamic detail.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.171
It looks like you bit off
more than you can chew

25:48.255 --> 25:51.299
in the amount of time.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.468
- Chris, your thoughts.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.262
- Well, Erik,
throughout the season,

25:55.345 --> 25:57.264
I saw you do a lot
of tricky maneuvers

25:57.347 --> 25:59.724
to make your tattoos stand out
over the field,

25:59.808 --> 26:01.309
and I feel like in this one,

26:01.393 --> 26:02.978
you might've tried to get
too tricky,

26:03.061 --> 26:05.146
because it has
a camouflage feel to it.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.940
You have a lot of light textures
throughout the tattoo,

26:07.023 --> 26:11.528
{\an1}and you didn't do dynamic colors
to separate some of the areas,

26:11.611 --> 26:12.737
so your color palette,

26:12.821 --> 26:16.074
combined with the texturing
that you did in this,

26:16.157 --> 26:18.326
it's a tough call

26:18.410 --> 26:21.746
to go up against the guys
you're going up against.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.666
- All right, Erik, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.252
[cheers and applause]

26:27.335 --> 26:30.839
- Cleen you're up next, man.

26:30.922 --> 26:34.175
[cheers and applause]

26:39.264 --> 26:40.056
Ollie.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.182
- Cleen, let me ask you
this question.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.477
How do you feel that this tattoo
fits into the category

26:44.561 --> 26:46.730
of color realism?

26:46.813 --> 26:50.317
- Well, I actually used
the photograph

26:50.400 --> 26:54.279
that I took of the images
to translate them to the skin.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.407
- I just don't see
how this bunch of blue swirl

26:57.490 --> 26:58.199
and cartoony look

26:58.283 --> 27:00.577
falls into that category.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.787
- Well, it is a tattoo, and you
have to be a little creative.

27:02.871 --> 27:06.207
- Creative is one thing,
but fitting the challenge

27:06.291 --> 27:08.418
is a major part
of this competition.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.294
You know, this thing,
to me, looks like

27:09.377 --> 27:12.505
a very new-school tattoo.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.634
- Thank, Ollie.
Chris.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.678
- Well, Cleen,
looking at this tattoo,

27:18.762 --> 27:19.637
it is a very technical tattoo,

27:19.721 --> 27:22.640
though, on the other hand, you,
as always,

27:22.724 --> 27:25.935
did a very strong,
solid application.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.105
It has a strong '90s,
new-school feel to me,

27:29.189 --> 27:30.690
but you did pull off a lot
of tricks in the tools.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.903
I don't feel like it's
the most photo-realism tattoo,

27:34.986 --> 27:38.031
but I do feel like it is a very
strong tattoo for you.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.743
[cheers and applause]

27:47.040 --> 27:48.833
- And that's all the time
that we have.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.376
Thank you very much.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.419
Jason, get on up here.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.881
[cheers and applause]

27:59.677 --> 28:02.597
All right, Oliver,
your thoughts for Jason.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.141
- Jason, my question
to you real quick is that,

28:05.225 --> 28:06.643
with the size of this tattoo,

28:06.726 --> 28:09.270
a lot of the background
and a lot of the colors

28:09.354 --> 28:10.355
aren't really as saturated
as they could've been--

28:10.438 --> 28:11.481
the light colors across the top.

28:11.564 --> 28:14.150
Did you run out of time
with this thing?

28:14.234 --> 28:14.859
- Absolutely not.

28:14.943 --> 28:15.944
I think that was meant to be,

28:16.027 --> 28:18.113
because I wanted the cricket
and the other elements

28:18.196 --> 28:20.115
more in focus.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.741
I did it really soft
to fade them off.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.078
That's the way I designed it
on purpose,

28:25.161 --> 28:26.538
so it's out of focus.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.706
I just think some
of your color saturation

28:28.790 --> 28:31.167
in the clouds,
in the pink in the tree,

28:31.251 --> 28:32.043
in the grass on the edges

28:32.127 --> 28:34.838
is just not
as technically solid.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.632
Your foreground images look like
you spend more time on them--

28:37.715 --> 28:39.717
very crisp, very vibrant.

28:39.801 --> 28:43.138
As far as capturing
the new school,

28:43.221 --> 28:44.973
I know that was
a tough challenge for you,

28:45.056 --> 28:46.724
and I really feel like,
you know,

28:46.808 --> 28:48.893
you hit the challenge
of new school.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.604
Overall, man, it's...

28:51.688 --> 28:53.731
[cheers and applause]

28:53.815 --> 28:56.734
This tattoo definitely
has its shortcomings--

28:56.818 --> 28:58.820
This tattoo definitely
has its shortcomings,

28:58.903 --> 29:00.864
but it's a big tattoo.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.867
- Thank you for your opinion.
- Let's hear from Chris.

29:03.950 --> 29:07.287
- Jason, I think you really
crammed a lot of work

29:07.370 --> 29:09.664
into your client's back piece.

29:09.747 --> 29:13.168
I feel like you lost
the aesthetic

29:13.251 --> 29:15.920
from the bottom to the top
in the craftsmanship.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.006
- Boo!
- I feel like the top

29:18.089 --> 29:19.007
is where you kind of lost it
a little bit.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.759
The bottom looks really--
it looks solid.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.720
It looks bright. It looks like
you put a lot of time into it.

29:23.803 --> 29:27.348
And at the top, we really get
a sense of some unsolid blue

29:27.432 --> 29:30.602
and just a lot of area
that you tried to fill quickly.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.438
- I have to disagree,
because that's the background.

29:33.521 --> 29:34.522
It's out of focus,

29:34.606 --> 29:37.358
and I need all that in there
to tell the story.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.318
But I value your opinion.
I appreciate it.

29:38.401 --> 29:39.277
Thank you very much.

{\an1}you made it this far, but one of
you is about to lose your shot

31:27.468 --> 31:30.013
at the title of Ink Master.

All right, guys,

Cleen, you're moving on
to the final two.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.038
I'm sorry, Erik.

That means that you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.086
- Erik, you were
a tremendous competitor,

32:43.169 --> 32:44.629
and it was really fun
to watch you.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.340
I had a great time watching
you work this season.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.216
I think you're a great artist,

32:48.299 --> 32:50.677
and I think you gave it
the fight, man.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.095
It was a pleasure.

Thank you.

One of these two artists
is very close to earning

33:33.886 --> 33:38.933
$100,000 and the title
of Ink Master,

33:39.016 --> 33:41.436
and we will get to that
in just a moment.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.396
But first, all night long,

33:43.479 --> 33:45.606
season four fan favorite,
Sausage,

33:45.690 --> 33:47.942
has been tattooing live.

33:48.025 --> 33:51.279
Sausage, let's take a look
at that thing.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.364
- What do you think, guys?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.032
- Whoo!
- Sausage!

33:55.116 --> 33:56.993
- Nice.
- It's all done.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.995
- Nice, man.
- Thanks, buddy.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.997
- Great job.
What's up for you now?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.207
- I'm opening up a shop
in Las Vegas

34:03.291 --> 34:06.002
with <i> Ink Master</i> season three
winner, Joey Hamilton.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.212

- Very cool.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.176
- It's called Revolt Tattoos,

34:13.259 --> 34:15.052
and you'll have to come out
and see us.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.219
- We will.
- Awesome.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.472
Thanks, guys.
- Right on, buddy.

[cheers and applause]

34:20.808 --> 34:22.185
All right.

34:22.268 --> 34:25.480
We started the season
with 18 artists,

34:25.563 --> 34:28.232
and now we're down to just two.

34:28.315 --> 34:31.110
Now, judges,
as we've been doing,

34:31.194 --> 34:34.071
let's just do
a live deliberation right here.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.701
- Man, this is really tough...

34:38.784 --> 34:40.036
two tattoos to pick from
for me.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.205
Cleen's tattoo
is very technically solid.

34:42.288 --> 34:47.502
Jason's tattoo really fits
the challenge of new school.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.170
Jason's tattoo is also
very bright and colorful.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.589
It's...

34:51.672 --> 34:54.634
I don't think we have a bad
tattoo out of the two bunch,

34:54.717 --> 34:55.927
but for me, it's really hard
to get past the fact

34:56.010 --> 34:58.262
that I don't think
that Cleen's

34:58.346 --> 35:01.474
hits the color-realism part
of the challenge.

35:01.557 --> 35:04.977
[audience booing]

35:05.061 --> 35:06.020
- Chris.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.481
- You know,
I think that Cleen's work

35:08.564 --> 35:11.192
really is very consistent,
though.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.529
It's a repeat of what he's done
from the first episode

35:14.612 --> 35:16.114
all the way to the finale,

35:16.197 --> 35:19.283
and I feel like,
as a judge on this show,

35:19.367 --> 35:21.244
I have to compliment
craftsmanship,

35:21.327 --> 35:23.412
and I feel like Cleen is that.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.123
[cheers and applause]
- I think--

35:25.206 --> 35:28.292
I think we know that Cleen
has great craftsmanship,

35:28.376 --> 35:31.420
and I think we know
he's a great technical tattooer.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.048
I think that both these artists
did what they had to do

35:34.132 --> 35:36.551
to get to the finale,
but now it's this last tattoo.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.261
This is it.
- I don't agree.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.471
- And I feel like,
you know, Jason--

35:40.555 --> 35:42.682
it's not like new school
is Jason's specialty.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.977
Jason really busted his hump
to get that new-school design.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.312

35:48.396 --> 35:52.567
- I just don't--
I don't see it that way, man.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.653
I see that Cleen busted his hump
the entire season

35:55.736 --> 35:59.198
and was the strongest tattooer
in the field, undeniably,

35:59.282 --> 36:00.741
and I think he wins.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.369

- All right, guys,
I need a final decision.

is always a tough decision.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.761
We always take this seriously.

36:20.845 --> 36:24.140
For me, this last tattoo...

36:24.223 --> 36:28.102
it has to--
the challenge has to matter.

36:28.185 --> 36:32.607
The challenge has to matter,
and for that, I'm picking Jason.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.909
- Chris, final decision.

is clear--Cleen.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.419
- Cleen, I'm going with you,

36:53.502 --> 36:55.922
because consistently throughout
the season, you did great.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.966
You were a solid tattooer, and
you represented the community

36:59.050 --> 37:00.885
with dignity and pride,
and I appreciate that.

$100,000 on the line
and a split decision,

37:10.144 --> 37:12.563
and I hate this.

my thoughts, guys.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.159
Now, here's the deal.

37:25.242 --> 37:27.703
I do think that Cleen
outperformed everybody here

throughout the season.

of these two tattoos to wear,

37:53.104 --> 37:53.896
You know, and I got to think
that, you know,

37:53.980 --> 37:57.483
if you look at the Super Bowl,

37:57.566 --> 37:59.610
and this is our Super Bowl,

37:59.694 --> 38:01.862
it doesn't matter
how the teams performed.

in the final game.
