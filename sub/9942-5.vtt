lt's Kev's mum. She's dead.

She fucking jumped.

Six floors up.

She even took someone out
on the ground.

Was there anything else?

Did you see anything else?

04:46.940 --> 04:49.981
Kev, she were depressed.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.261
You said yourself, she probably
didn't even know what day it was.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.301
How could she not know, Veronica?

04:55.340 --> 04:58.061
32 years to the fucking day.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.541
Of all the days she
could have picked.

05:01.581 --> 05:04.101
She could have sent me
a fucking card.

05:06.260 --> 05:08.381
Hey.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.021
Superb choice.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.861
The only trouble is,

05:18.901 --> 05:21.061
ltalian food

05:21.100 --> 05:24.741
makes me really horny.

05:24.781 --> 05:27.221
lt does, honest. It does.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.901
Eh. No. l can't.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.421
- Come on.
- Not here.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.501
Come on, come on.
Where's your sense of adventure?

05:33.541 --> 05:35.421
Eh?

05:45.260 --> 05:46.741
Mum!

05:46.781 --> 05:48.661
Oh.

05:49.701 --> 05:53.981
Norman, this is my daughter,
Veronica, and her partner, Kev.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.941
Sorry to hear about your loss.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.741
Wonde_ul restaurant, though.

05:58.781 --> 06:01.861
Come on now, see... Hey.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.541
< Mm, ah, ooh!

06:09.940 --> 06:10.901
They're loading someone up.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.021
lt's a chapel of rest. That's what
they do, innit? Oh, Jesus!

06:14.060 --> 06:14.581
What?

06:14.621 --> 06:15.581
Reverse! Reverse!

06:15.621 --> 06:16.541
What the fuck's the matter?

06:16.581 --> 06:18.541
Just move it, quick. Veronica...

06:18.581 --> 06:20.821
- l'm trying!
- Not fucking hard enough!

06:20.861 --> 06:22.341
l can't get it in fucking gear!

06:22.380 --> 06:23.861
Watch it!

06:23.901 --> 06:25.861
Mind me fucking hearse!

06:25.901 --> 06:28.181
Look what you've done to me
fucking car!

06:28.220 --> 06:32.181
What the fuck were that all about?
You know l can't drive in a panic!

06:38.980 --> 06:40.861
So, who is she?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.261
Who's who?

06:42.300 --> 06:45.661
l know we're in a chapel of rest,
Kev, but l will still twat ya.

06:45.701 --> 06:47.901
Look, it's complicated.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.741
l'm not even sure if...
Just hang on.

06:52.861 --> 06:55.101
Thought so.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.381
Roxy.

06:56.421 --> 07:00.301
Roxy Benson? l thought she was
in prison.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.821
- She was.
- So what's she doing here?

07:02.861 --> 07:06.501
She knew me mam. She must have come
to pay her respects or something.

07:06.541 --> 07:09.221
Roxy Ball? She signed herself Ball.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.221
We are still married, Vee.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.061
She hasn't seen you for ten years.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.501
You asked her for a divorce
when she was inside.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.981
Why the fuck would she still be
calling herself Ball?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.741
< CLEARS THROAT

07:20.781 --> 07:22.781
lf you'd like to come through.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.941
She's absolutely fucking gorgeous.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.661
Me mam?

07:38.701 --> 07:40.621
Roxy!

07:40.661 --> 07:44.021
She was stunning
when you married her. You told me.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.941
Not now, eh, Vee.

07:51.661 --> 07:53.181
Does she still look the same?

07:53.220 --> 07:54.421
Veronica...

07:54.461 --> 07:57.181
Perhaps you'd like to say
your goodbyes now, Kevin.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.701
Yeah.

08:04.421 --> 08:06.381
Bye, Mam.

08:06.421 --> 08:08.781
l hope you've gone to a better place.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.541
(You coulda sent me
a birthday card, though.)

08:45.501 --> 08:46.661
Pass me a spoon, Carl. >

08:46.701 --> 08:47.661
No. >

08:47.701 --> 08:49.661

08:49.701 --> 08:51.741
Dreamt l was this banana thing and
had this fight with a grapefruit.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.941
You're weird, you, Marty.

08:54.821 --> 08:57.741
Er, we're out of milk.

08:57.781 --> 09:00.981
Couldn't pinch a pint, could l?

09:01.020 --> 09:02.901
Norman Owens, Carol's friend.

09:02.940 --> 09:06.381
l've promised her breaMast in bed.
OK if l, er...?

09:09.980 --> 09:12.181
Clegnuts!

09:12.220 --> 09:13.901
KNOCKING

09:17.421 --> 09:18.301
Morning.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.021
Heya, gorgeous.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.181
Can l hold her, Mandy?

09:24.220 --> 09:27.221
This Friday, how you fixed?

09:27.260 --> 09:28.261
What, the whole day?

09:28.300 --> 09:31.581
ls that a problem, Daddy? You've
been begging to spend time with her.

09:31.621 --> 09:34.141
No, no, it's erm...

09:34.180 --> 09:35.501
Kev's mum's died.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.221
Funeral's Friday. >

09:37.260 --> 09:39.021
Close, were you?

09:39.060 --> 09:41.181
You wouldn't have
any eggs, would you?

09:41.220 --> 09:42.941
Slag!

09:46.940 --> 09:48.421
They're all for the tramic warden.

09:48.461 --> 09:50.141
Never mind.

10:02.901 --> 10:04.741
The state of this place.

10:05.781 --> 10:07.461
No wonder she jumped.

10:09.020 --> 10:10.501
Sorry.

10:13.621 --> 10:16.181
How could she not leave a note?

10:16.220 --> 10:19.621
When you pop out for milk,
you leave a note.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.181
Down the shops, note.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.661
l mean, would it have
killed her to leave a note?

10:26.220 --> 10:28.821
Let's just get her things sorted.
Then you need never come here again.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.741
Joking, aren't you?

10:31.781 --> 10:34.061
Lick of paint, few rugs down.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.861
l'm thinking bachelor pad.
Card schools, footy games.

10:36.901 --> 10:39.221
Somewhere to put me head down
when you're getting on me nerves.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.141
You do in here.

10:41.180 --> 10:44.101
l'll do in t'bedroom.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.741
Say that again.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.981
l'm a nudist. l'm proud of it.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.661
l don't adhere to society's
assumptions that the naked body

10:53.701 --> 10:55.181
should be hidden away.

10:55.220 --> 10:59.381
l mean, look at it.
It's a beautiful piece of design.

10:59.421 --> 11:00.581
Not all of it isn't.

11:00.621 --> 11:02.501
You weren't saying that last night.

11:02.541 --> 11:04.141
Don't be vulgar.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.261
Slip your gown om.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.381
Norman!

11:08.421 --> 11:10.181
No, no, trust me.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.341
Slip it om.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.661
There.

11:15.701 --> 11:18.741
That's how God intended you
to be - free from concealment.

11:18.781 --> 11:21.421
Now, tell me that
doesn't feel natural.

11:21.461 --> 11:22.981
FARTS

11:23.020 --> 11:24.341
Sorry.

11:25.380 --> 11:29.181
l'm always a touch
flatulent after carbonara.

11:50.260 --> 11:52.181
No wonder she were depressed.

11:52.220 --> 11:55.341
She's kept a scrap book on
Diana's life. Really detailed. >

11:55.380 --> 11:57.901
Marriage, kids, amairs.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.661
There's even a section on bulimia. >

12:02.421 --> 12:03.781
God, this is certifiable.

12:03.821 --> 12:05.941
Didn't you know
she was a Diana freak?

12:05.980 --> 12:08.941
l'm starting to think
l didn't know her at all.

12:13.421 --> 12:17.541
There's hundreds. Me mam and Roxy must
have been writing to each other the whole time.

12:17.581 --> 12:20.061
You'd better start going to
that adult-literacy class again.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.981
l don't need a lecture, Karen.
Just read the fucking letters.

12:23.020 --> 12:24.821
Tell you what,
it's pretty heavy stum.

12:24.861 --> 12:26.301
What sort of heavy?

12:26.340 --> 12:28.581
The way she talks about you.

12:28.621 --> 12:32.581
''Kev's still the one l think about at lights out.
The times we had together were so special.''

12:32.621 --> 12:35.021
Are you winding me up?
Cos l mean it, Karen...

12:35.060 --> 12:37.021
Just get someone else
to read them, then!

12:37.060 --> 12:38.621
All right.

12:39.661 --> 12:41.581
Here you are.

12:43.621 --> 12:47.381
We had this really
intense relationship,

12:47.421 --> 12:49.341
whirlwind marriage, the works.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.421
lt was like living inside a tornado.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.901
Few drinks down her neck,
she turned into a monster.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.981
How long was she in prison?

12:57.020 --> 13:01.181
Oh, a few years. GBH.
She's a lunatic.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.061
She's gorgeous, though.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.381
Yeah.

13:05.421 --> 13:07.221
Yeah, sex was summat else.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.341
You'll be all right.
You probably won't even see her again.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.021
Cheers, Karen.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.781
Hiya, Kev. Long time, no see.

13:20.421 --> 13:23.141
l got out a few
weeks before Christmas.

13:23.180 --> 13:27.141
Still on probation, so if l misbehave
they'll have me straight back inside.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.661
You seem dimerent, Rox.

13:29.701 --> 13:31.541
Sort of...

13:31.581 --> 13:32.661
l dunno, like...

13:32.701 --> 13:33.701
Calmer.

13:33.741 --> 13:35.501
Jail's been good for me.

13:35.541 --> 13:38.021
Rehabilitation.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.901
l learnt a lot about myself.

13:39.940 --> 13:43.741
Anger management, two classes a week.
Why do you think l'm on this stum?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.141
Yeah, l'm not gonna lie, you were
pretty fiery after a tipple.

13:46.180 --> 13:49.421
Fiery? l was frigging deranged!

13:53.621 --> 13:58.821
l'm really sorry about your mam, Kev.
She was a lovely woman.

13:58.861 --> 14:00.301
She liked you.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.701
Yeah, we got on.

14:02.741 --> 14:06.341
Did you keep in touch with
her when you were inside?

14:06.380 --> 14:09.701
We wrote a bit.
Both had time on our hands.

14:09.741 --> 14:11.661
But she always kept
me informed about you.

14:11.701 --> 14:13.781
Bet that was a boring old read!

14:13.821 --> 14:16.101
No, not at all.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.581
l enjoyed hearing about you.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.861
ls he serving today or what?
Oi, lazy arse!

14:22.901 --> 14:25.741
No, Jez, that's his wife.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.101
Or his ex, before Veronica.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.581
You two are getting close
these days, aren't you?

14:32.140 --> 14:34.101
His mum's died, Jez.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.621
Suppose.

14:36.661 --> 14:39.981
Still, don't let him take advantage.

14:40.020 --> 14:41.061
So, this woman you're with...?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.541
Veronica.

14:42.581 --> 14:43.661
You serious about her?

14:43.701 --> 14:45.861
We've been together ten years.

14:45.901 --> 14:47.301
But you've not married?

14:47.340 --> 14:51.621
Well, we sort of got married.
Just wasn't legal.

14:51.661 --> 14:54.261
But we're still married.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.541
So that makes you a bigamist.

14:55.581 --> 14:58.821
Well, yeah. Just not legally.

15:03.581 --> 15:05.141
Can l get you another drink?

15:05.180 --> 15:07.541
No, l'm gonna get on.

15:07.581 --> 15:11.381
- But it was really nice to see you Kev.
- Yeah, and you.

15:17.060 --> 15:19.061
Guess l'll see you at the funeral.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.261
Oh, Jesus!

15:38.300 --> 15:39.901
l thought you were asleep.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.581
Doesn't usually bother yer.

15:41.621 --> 15:43.341
The consulate rang.

15:43.380 --> 15:47.701
They've rang every bar in Paphos,
they can't trace your Kelly.

15:47.741 --> 15:49.461
We'll have to do the
funeral without her.

15:49.501 --> 15:51.741
We can't do that, Veronica.
It's her mam an' all.

15:51.781 --> 15:53.661
They can only wait so long, Kev.

15:53.701 --> 15:55.941
You can't have dead bodies
hanging around all year.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.501
l know, l know.

15:57.541 --> 16:01.861
Bloody hell, Kelly.
You could have left a contact...

16:01.901 --> 16:03.461
What's the matter?

16:03.501 --> 16:05.221
Apart from the fact that my mum's dead

16:05.260 --> 16:08.341
and l can't find my
fucking sister, nothing!

16:08.380 --> 16:09.981
Hey, come here.

16:18.701 --> 16:21.061
Veronica, about the funeral...

16:27.020 --> 16:29.861
Do you think l should
l get my suit cleaned?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.381
Come here, you!

16:52.741 --> 16:53.981
lt's all right this, innit? >

16:54.020 --> 16:55.981
Slide the nappy under.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.221
How many hands do you think l've got?

16:57.260 --> 16:58.461
Well, come here then.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.381
< No, l've gotta learn.

17:00.421 --> 17:02.661
Have you ever met
a manic depressive?

17:02.701 --> 17:04.540
They're hard work.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.701
They're either on the
ceiling or hitting the deck.

17:06.741 --> 17:09.060
Literally in me mum's case.

17:09.099 --> 17:12.060
Mental illness is a
terrible amliction.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.741
Well, you'll know better than us.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.021
How do you mean?

17:16.060 --> 17:17.741
With Sheila.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.901
Me mam's not mentally ill.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.901
lsn't she?

17:23.940 --> 17:26.141
l got these for the
top of the wedding cake.

17:26.180 --> 17:28.781
l fell in love with
them straight away.

17:28.821 --> 17:31.101
They look just like me and Frank!

17:31.140 --> 17:32.501
< (Lip) l've left the bottle in the kitchen.

17:32.541 --> 17:33.541
< (lan) l'll go and get it.

17:33.581 --> 17:36.381
Hearse is here. Come on,
everyone, drink up, chop chop.

17:36.421 --> 17:40.021
Hang on two secs. Lip's left
the baby's bottle ne_ door.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.541
(Veronica) Come on!

17:47.821 --> 17:49.621
Whoa!

17:51.020 --> 17:53.301
- l thought you were at this funeral!
- Sorry.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.181
Sorry, Carol. It's Lip, he's...

17:55.220 --> 17:56.941
What are you doing?!

17:56.980 --> 17:59.261
We shroud our bodies
in secrecy and shame.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.781
We should celebrate them,
like newborn babies!

18:03.821 --> 18:07.941
l'm sorry, Norman, l can't do this.
It doesn't feel right.

18:07.980 --> 18:11.141
You're bowing to
society's conventions, Carol.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.661
That's right. Because society
doesn't want 16-year-old boys

18:13.701 --> 18:15.741
looking at my 60-year-old tush!

18:18.220 --> 18:21.141
Each to their own, Norman, but why
the fuck do you wanna eat naked?

18:21.180 --> 18:24.221
The question you
should ask is, why not?

18:24.260 --> 18:27.501
Does the sight of my penis
really upset you that much?

18:29.060 --> 18:30.101
l'll see you at the wake.

18:40.701 --> 18:42.981
Chief mourners in this first car.

18:43.020 --> 18:46.221
Everyone else to the rear, please.

18:49.781 --> 18:52.341
Roxy, what the fuck
are you doing in there?

18:52.380 --> 18:54.181
lt's what she would have wanted.

19:06.581 --> 19:08.621
Everybody happy? Lovely.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.461
l'm sorry, Norman, it's not for me.

19:23.501 --> 19:26.141
Call me conventional, but l can't go

19:26.180 --> 19:29.501
around with my privates on parade.
It's just not me!

19:29.541 --> 19:32.661
OK, OK. But promise me one thing.

19:32.701 --> 19:34.581
You won't close your
mind to possibilities.

19:34.621 --> 19:37.661
Because life's an exploration, Carol.

19:37.701 --> 19:41.061
You never know what you'll
like unless you try it.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.181
What have you got in mind?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.861
l'm sorry, Mummy.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.661
l won't do it again.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.061
Nothing too outrageous.

19:53.100 --> 19:56.101
Kev, l know everybody's
probably said it,

19:56.140 --> 19:58.861
but if there's anything l can do...

19:58.901 --> 20:00.661
Ta.

20:01.980 --> 20:06.141
Hey, Karen, can you get
some decent music sorted?

20:09.461 --> 20:12.901
Did you know her? Kev's mum.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.821
Not really. As mad as mustard.

20:15.861 --> 20:18.501
They were never that close,
Kev's family.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.341
Debbie!

20:23.380 --> 20:26.621
Suicide is part of the natural
ebb and flow.

20:26.661 --> 20:29.501
Used to be wars and famine,
now it's miserable bastards chucking

20:29.541 --> 20:30.901
themselves om tower blocks.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.901
They're lightening the load, making sure
there's enough space left for the rest of us.

20:34.940 --> 20:37.061
You think l'm talking
bollocks, don't you?

20:37.100 --> 20:38.621
Let me tell you
something, smart arse.

20:38.661 --> 20:41.901
She was a mistake. Nobody fucking
ordered her, she just arrived.

20:41.940 --> 20:42.941
So?

20:42.980 --> 20:46.981
So, to equal each mistake,
someone has to check out early.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.661
What about the people who can't have
kids, like Kev and Veronica?

20:49.701 --> 20:52.061
Does someone
come back to fucking life?

20:52.100 --> 20:56.301
Natural selection. DaM/in, 2001 .

20:56.340 --> 20:59.701
Who'd wanna see the omspring of
that pair of fucking reprobates?

20:59.741 --> 21:02.661
lt'd come out looking
like Jiminy Cricket.

21:15.621 --> 21:18.061
You don't have to hate me, Veronica.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.621
Just because he used to fall at my
feet, it doesn't mean anything.

21:20.661 --> 21:22.861
lt's how he feels now that matters.

21:29.861 --> 21:35.261
MUSIC: Can't Get You Out of My Head
by Kylie Minogue

21:35.300 --> 21:39.181
l just can't get you
out of my head

21:39.220 --> 21:42.941
Boy, your loving is all
J think about

21:42.980 --> 21:46.701
l just can't get you
out of my head

21:46.741 --> 21:50.981
Boy, it's more than
l dare to think about...

21:51.020 --> 21:54.181
WEDDING BELLS PEAL

21:57.421 --> 22:01.581
l just can't get you
out of my head

22:01.621 --> 22:04.541
_oy, your love is
all that J think about.

22:04.581 --> 22:06.141
Remember me?

22:06.180 --> 22:08.861
l know it must be hard prizing
yourself away from tarty tits,

22:08.901 --> 22:10.781
but l'm your fucking wife!

22:10.821 --> 22:11.821
Veronica...

22:11.861 --> 22:14.341
Fuck om. l know your game, love.
Eh? l've met your type before.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.021
Nice as pie then
shaft you in the back.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.421
He's my husband now,
so you can take your pretty face

22:19.461 --> 22:22.981
- and go and get fucked.
- Veronica.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.701
Your husband? You wanna
check the marriage certificate.

22:25.741 --> 22:28.781
- Last time l looked it said Roxy Ball.
- Ancient history, sweetheart.

22:28.821 --> 22:30.541
Funny how he never got a divorce.

22:30.581 --> 22:31.621
You were in fucking prison!

22:31.661 --> 22:35.781
Or maybe he just wanted a proper
woman. Someone who can give him kids.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.221
You poisonous fucking bitch!

22:38.260 --> 22:40.941
Fucking hell!

22:40.980 --> 22:43.701
(Frank) Here we go.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.141
(lan) Marty, help us out!

22:48.180 --> 22:50.101
Leave her alone!

22:51.861 --> 22:56.501
Come on! Come on, you slag!
l'll fucking have you!

22:56.541 --> 23:00.621
lf l'd have fought back,
you'd be dead.

23:03.541 --> 23:06.501
Take her home.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.941
Get om!

23:12.980 --> 23:15.261
There's your mum.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.981
l think l got most of her.

23:24.940 --> 23:26.861
< Roxy?

23:27.901 --> 23:28.901
You OK?

23:28.940 --> 23:29.941
l'm sorry.

23:29.980 --> 23:32.421
That shouldn't have happened.
Not here at your mam's wake.

23:32.461 --> 23:34.621
Wasn't your fault.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.901
Can't believe she's gone.

23:40.940 --> 23:43.381
l know we weren't close but...

23:45.621 --> 23:46.821
..she was me mam.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.861
l'm never gonna see her again.

23:51.901 --> 23:55.421
Do you wanna talk about her?

24:34.461 --> 24:35.941
Kev?

24:48.980 --> 24:50.461
Kev?

24:54.020 --> 24:57.181
l'm thinking bachelor pad,

24:57.220 --> 25:01.301
somewhere to put my head down
when you're getting on me nerves.

25:13.861 --> 25:15.141
You bastard!

25:15.180 --> 25:16.381
Fuck!

25:18.501 --> 25:21.501
Veronica! Veronica!

25:21.541 --> 25:24.341
Fuck! Veronica!

25:30.140 --> 25:32.981
Wait. It's not how it looks.
Nothing happened.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.821
Get away from me!
Get away, and stay away!

25:35.861 --> 25:36.861
Listen to me!

25:36.901 --> 25:38.421
Because it's over, Kev.

25:38.461 --> 25:39.941
lt's over.

26:08.100 --> 26:13.261
Veronica. For fuck's sake, will
you just hear me out?

26:13.300 --> 26:14.541
Nothing happened!

26:14.581 --> 26:16.021
What's going on?

26:16.060 --> 26:19.061
What's it look like?
She's booted me out!

26:19.100 --> 26:20.741
She's booted you out? After last night?

26:20.781 --> 26:23.461
She caught me and Roxy
at me mam's place.

26:23.501 --> 26:26.301
- Kev, you didn't?
- But nothing happened!

26:26.340 --> 26:28.621
You and Roxy, same bed
and nothing happened?

26:28.661 --> 26:30.021
Veronica!

26:30.060 --> 26:31.101
What the bloody hell?!

26:31.140 --> 26:32.661
Talk to Veronica? She's thrown him out.

26:32.701 --> 26:33.861
And say what?

26:33.901 --> 26:35.861
Something. They're splitting up!

26:35.901 --> 26:38.781
Never get involved with a domestic.
No-one thanks you for it.

26:38.821 --> 26:40.821
< Come on, Norm.

26:41.980 --> 26:43.701
Veronica!

26:48.701 --> 26:53.941
Did you do it, Kev?
Did you shag her, Roxy?

26:56.300 --> 26:59.261
Truth?

26:59.300 --> 27:02.061
We started.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.301
But l stopped it.

27:04.340 --> 27:07.021
Not cos of guilt.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.741
l just needed someone there.

27:09.781 --> 27:12.461
You know?

27:12.501 --> 27:15.261
Someone who cared.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.581
l had a sly wank, though,
when she'd gone to sleep.

27:21.621 --> 27:24.101
Well, you've got to, haven't you?

27:30.060 --> 27:33.181
Veronica!

27:33.220 --> 27:36.021
Veronica, open the door!

28:12.060 --> 28:15.181
Hi. Party round at Martika's.
Thought you might wanna join me.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.621
Can't, Rox. l'm working.

28:16.661 --> 28:18.821
Grief does funny things to people.
Tell them you're not feeling well.

28:18.861 --> 28:21.101
Oi, she's thrown me
out because of last night.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.981
- It's OK.
- No, it's not OK. Far fucking from it.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.821
Everything's gone down the shitter.

28:29.020 --> 28:32.261
Not everything, Kev.
You haven't lost everything.

28:32.300 --> 28:35.101
Look, there's something l
should have told you about us.

28:35.140 --> 28:38.461
- Well, about you.
- What?

28:38.501 --> 28:43.021
lt's not you that's infertile, Kev.
At least, you weren't with me.

28:46.661 --> 28:50.101
Get om! Marty, help!

28:50.140 --> 28:52.181
Get om!

28:56.100 --> 29:01.021
Thanks, Debs. No omence,
but l need to speak to Fiona.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.541
She doesn't live here any more.

29:02.581 --> 29:05.581
Her new number's on the pinboard.

29:07.741 --> 29:09.741
Party best!

29:09.781 --> 29:12.141
How do l look?

29:12.180 --> 29:14.741
Honest opinion not required.

29:14.781 --> 29:15.981
What's the occasion?

29:16.020 --> 29:19.861
Showing her om to friends of mine.
Special night for a special lady.

29:19.901 --> 29:21.581
Don't wait up! >

29:23.100 --> 29:24.781
Norman!

29:24.821 --> 29:26.701
l'm fine.

29:26.741 --> 29:29.101
Thanks for asking.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.661
Jesus. A kid.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.981
l've been for tests.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.301
l thought l couldn't have them.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.101
But why didn't you tell me?

29:39.140 --> 29:41.661
You know what l was like back then.

29:41.701 --> 29:44.621
l suppose l saw it as revenge.

29:44.661 --> 29:48.181
Had him adopted om at two months.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.541
Little boy.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.181
Ryan.

29:53.220 --> 29:54.781
Ryan?

29:56.340 --> 30:00.741
l wasn't fit, Kev. l could barely
Iook after meself, let alone a baby.

30:00.781 --> 30:03.501
But your mam was brilliant.

30:04.581 --> 30:07.061
She looked after all the papeM/ork

30:07.100 --> 30:09.101
and made sure he went
to a good home.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.381
Me mam knew.

30:13.380 --> 30:16.301
He'll be ten this Easter.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.621
Any photos of him?

30:19.300 --> 30:20.861
Did he look like me?

30:21.940 --> 30:23.981
Yeah, a bit.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.581
Around the eyes.

30:26.621 --> 30:30.821
Like pissholes in the snow.

30:30.861 --> 30:33.701
He'll be a good-looking kid,
just like his daddy.

30:42.501 --> 30:44.541
This looks like the spot.

30:46.661 --> 30:49.861
There's not a house in sight.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

30:49.901 --> 30:52.621
Who said anything about houses?

30:52.661 --> 30:57.901
You said party,
friends of yours, dress to impress.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.941
Who needs bedrooms
when you've got the great outdoors?

31:01.980 --> 31:03.861
See that car over there?

31:03.901 --> 31:05.501
That's Marian and Phil.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.461
Nice couple.
He's a landscape gardener.

31:07.501 --> 31:11.581
Did my patio last summer, lovely job.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.301
They do anal, doggy and fisting.

31:13.340 --> 31:16.581
They're not into orgies.

31:16.621 --> 31:18.301
You're not seriously suggesting... !

31:18.340 --> 31:22.861
Open your mind, Carol.
Let go of the fear.

31:22.901 --> 31:25.221
Live pornography,

31:25.260 --> 31:28.141
inches away from you.

31:28.180 --> 31:31.381
Oh, it's like nothing
you've ever experienced!

31:33.140 --> 31:35.341
There's no touching,
and no photography.

31:35.380 --> 31:38.461
But if you want to whack
yourself om while you're watching,

31:38.501 --> 31:40.061
no-one's going to protest.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.101
Take me home.

31:42.140 --> 31:44.341
What? Why?

31:44.380 --> 31:47.221
The penis salad was
one thing, but this...

31:47.260 --> 31:48.941
Where you going?

31:48.980 --> 31:50.261
Home!

31:50.300 --> 31:51.661
< Carol. Carol!

31:51.701 --> 31:54.261
They'll think we're timewasters!

32:19.300 --> 32:20.701
Yes! >

32:20.741 --> 32:23.421
Yes! >

32:23.461 --> 32:24.941
That's it, baby. >

32:24.980 --> 32:26.461
That's it. >

32:26.501 --> 32:29.661
GRUNTS

32:29.701 --> 32:32.621
Oh! >

32:32.661 --> 32:34.261
Oh, yes! >

32:34.300 --> 32:36.821
Oh, yeah, yeah...! >

32:36.861 --> 32:39.181
- Don't mind me.
- Kev!

32:39.220 --> 32:40.661
You scared the shit out of me!

32:40.701 --> 32:42.141
Who's he?!

32:42.180 --> 32:43.941
l work here. Who the fuck are you?

32:43.980 --> 32:45.301
Mate of mine. Tim.

32:45.340 --> 32:46.461
Jim.

32:46.501 --> 32:48.541
How else am l supposed to get any?

32:48.581 --> 32:51.141
lf l take anybody upstairs,
Jez is listening at the door.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.821
< (Jez) Karen, is that you, love?
- Jesus. Get down there.

32:59.180 --> 33:00.981
ls he bothering you?

33:01.020 --> 33:05.061
No...l came down for a drink
and...Kev thought l was an intruder.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.301
Well she's not. She lives here.

33:07.340 --> 33:10.661
And l'd like to see her back
where she belongs - with me.

33:12.501 --> 33:14.461
l know your mum's died, Kev,

33:14.501 --> 33:16.501
but you can only use
that excuse for so long.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.341
Looks like it's just
me and you, mate.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.621
Fancy a pint?

33:35.661 --> 33:38.421
You accommodate it,

33:38.461 --> 33:40.381
the idea that you're shooting blanks.

33:40.421 --> 33:42.221
lt becomes a part of who you are.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.661
And then suddenly, wallop.

33:44.701 --> 33:46.501
Everything's turned upside down.

33:46.541 --> 33:48.701
You don't know how to feel,
but it's like a million

33:48.741 --> 33:50.581
dimerent feelings all at once.

33:50.621 --> 33:53.461
Suddenly, everything's
under the microscope.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.861
My whole future. Who do l love?

33:55.901 --> 33:57.581
What do l want?

33:57.621 --> 34:02.381
l need to have a family of my own,
l'm one of them blokes.

34:02.421 --> 34:05.701
lt's like this fucking great
big hole that has to be filled.

34:05.741 --> 34:06.901
Are you with me?

34:06.940 --> 34:09.581
Absolutely, mate. Absolutely.

34:11.821 --> 34:14.181
- The other thing, Tim...
- Jim.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.181
Sorry. l don't know about you, but...

34:24.501 --> 34:27.821
You look like death. You could
have at least brushed your hair.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.701
Do you even care?

34:29.741 --> 34:32.101
Do you give the smallest
shit what happens to me?

34:32.139 --> 34:34.541
Of course l care.

34:34.581 --> 34:37.420
But life goes on, Veronica.

34:37.460 --> 34:40.940
l've split up with Norman, but
you don't see me moping around.

34:40.980 --> 34:43.981
We've been together ten years!
He was me fucking life!

34:44.020 --> 34:47.101
What do you expect,
you stupid old bitch?!

34:47.139 --> 34:49.781
Now stop that. That's no way to
speak to your mother.

34:49.821 --> 34:53.860
Start behaving like one and
l'll start speaking to you like one.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.860
And what's that supposed to mean?

34:57.901 --> 35:01.181
You're my mum! Make it better!

35:01.220 --> 35:04.341
Make it all all right again!

35:04.380 --> 35:07.501
l don't know what...

35:10.501 --> 35:15.301
What do you expect me
to do about it?

35:17.220 --> 35:19.221
Carol, fuck om.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.821
He's all l had in the world.

35:29.781 --> 35:32.381
l only came in for bog roll.

35:34.621 --> 35:36.101
(Mandy) Did you have a good time?

35:36.140 --> 35:38.701
(Lip) l loved it. She's amazing.

35:38.741 --> 35:40.661
Even the crying didn't bother me.

35:40.701 --> 35:42.221
You want to try it every night.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.541
Let me, then.

35:44.581 --> 35:46.341
Let me have her more often.

35:46.380 --> 35:47.861
Weekends.

35:47.901 --> 35:49.781
l want to.

35:49.821 --> 35:51.661
You don't.

35:51.701 --> 35:53.861
You wouldn't. And you can't.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.861
Apart from anything,
me mum wouldn't allow it.

36:00.901 --> 36:03.501
What the fuck you doing?

36:03.541 --> 36:05.261
Mum, dad, baby.

36:09.260 --> 36:11.421
Just wanted to see how it feels.

36:12.461 --> 36:15.141
You're om your head, you.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.741
You fucking moron!

36:22.781 --> 36:25.141
Oh, nice to see you too, Yvonne.

36:25.180 --> 36:27.781
Veronica has told me everything.
You deserve your bollocks chopping om!

36:27.821 --> 36:29.741
l didn't shag her.

36:29.781 --> 36:31.701
No, but you spent the
night there.

36:31.741 --> 36:34.341
Talking and cuddling. That's worse!

36:34.380 --> 36:35.981
ln which universe?!

36:36.020 --> 36:39.821
You'll lose the best thing that's ever happened
to you, and you're stood here like pimy!

36:39.861 --> 36:41.741
l'm giving her some cooling space.

36:41.781 --> 36:44.301
How does a few hundred miles grab you?

36:44.340 --> 36:46.421
You what?

36:46.461 --> 36:48.261
She's leaving. Tomorrow.

36:48.300 --> 36:51.261
Fiona's invited her to Amsterdam.
If you've got any sense,

36:51.300 --> 36:54.381
you'll pull your finger out of your
arse and get round there.

36:54.421 --> 36:57.061
Will you cover for an hour?

36:57.100 --> 36:59.181
The very man. l thought we
could spend the day together.

36:59.220 --> 37:00.541
No, Roxy, we can't.

37:00.581 --> 37:03.061
Stop trying to fight it.
l know you can't resist me!

37:03.100 --> 37:05.821
Get it into your thick skull.
The other night meant nothing.

37:05.861 --> 37:08.101
Our marriage means nothing!

37:08.140 --> 37:10.981
And what about your child, Kev?
Does that mean nothing?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.741
Right now,

37:12.781 --> 37:14.061
yeS.

37:21.581 --> 37:23.381
Double vodka.

37:23.421 --> 37:24.901
No ice.

37:29.220 --> 37:33.021
She's round at ours. She won't
come back until you've gone away.

37:34.581 --> 37:36.781
Does everyone over there hate me?

37:36.821 --> 37:38.621
No-one hates you.

37:38.661 --> 37:41.101
We just wish it wasn't happening.

37:41.140 --> 37:43.821
lt's sad.

37:43.861 --> 37:47.421
You're Kev and Veronica,
you're like bangers and mash.

37:47.461 --> 37:49.221
Fish and chips.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.181
Vodka and tonic.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.901
lmportant lesson in life, Debs.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.861
Sooner or later
men always fuck it' up.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.981
l know.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.741
lf l were you, l'd become a lesbian.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.661
l'll bear that in mind.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.861
You'll be all right, Jez.
You'll be all right.

38:13.901 --> 38:16.101
Your fucking wife did this!

38:16.140 --> 38:17.141
Why fucking serve her?

38:17.180 --> 38:20.861
- Because we're a fucking pub!
- After everything l told you, Karen!

38:20.901 --> 38:23.421
l'm not a social worker! If people
drink, l assume they can handle it.

38:23.461 --> 38:24.821
She's an alcoholic!

38:24.861 --> 38:26.341
Oh, l know that now!

38:30.300 --> 38:33.821
She nearly finished the whole bottle
then starts calling me a slag,

38:33.861 --> 38:35.301
and accusing me of being in love with you.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.741
You what?

38:36.781 --> 38:38.621
That was when Jez stepped in.

38:39.980 --> 38:42.341
lt was horrible.
It was really horrible.

38:42.380 --> 38:43.421
lt's all my fault.

38:43.461 --> 38:45.741
No, it's mine. l should've told you.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.821
Told me what?

38:46.861 --> 38:49.181
The letters.
The ones she wrote to your mam

38:49.220 --> 38:52.141
while she was in prison.
l've been reading through 'em.

38:52.180 --> 38:55.421
She's obsessed with you.
Like, delusional.

38:55.461 --> 38:58.221
And it seems that your mam
played along with her fantasy.

38:58.260 --> 38:59.301
Oh, what fantasy?

38:59.340 --> 39:02.541
You and Roxy. Back together.
House, kids, happy ever after...

39:02.581 --> 39:04.581
- Do the letters say we had a kid?
- Who?

39:04.621 --> 39:06.581
Me and Roxy. She gave it up for adoption.

39:06.621 --> 39:07.621
Not that l've read.

39:07.661 --> 39:08.701
How far through are you?

39:08.741 --> 39:12.221
l've got a life, you know!
And they are not exactly Bridget Jones!

39:16.861 --> 39:20.221
Oh, l don't think Jez'll
want you staying here tonight.

39:26.180 --> 39:30.261
l'm a sexual being, Carol,
always have been,

39:30.300 --> 39:33.181
and asking me to change that

39:33.220 --> 39:36.661
is like asking the daisies
not to flower in spring.

39:37.621 --> 39:41.381
But l'm also a man
who listens to his heart.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.901
And this beating old drum of mine

39:43.940 --> 39:47.061
is telling me l'd be foolish
to let you go.

39:48.901 --> 39:51.781
l love you, Carol Fisher.

39:51.821 --> 39:56.101
And if that means compromise,
then compromise it is.

39:58.260 --> 40:04.381
You, Norman Owens, are the most
wonde_ul man l've met in years.

40:07.180 --> 40:11.061
l'd just like to say,
as long as it's within

40:11.100 --> 40:15.781
the confines of these walls,
l'm very open-minded.

40:23.461 --> 40:25.141
< l wish l were going with you.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.981
Will you give this to our Fiona?

40:29.020 --> 40:32.381
As long as it's not something
l have to explain at customs.

40:32.421 --> 40:35.221
We've all written letters.
There's recent photos and stum.

40:35.260 --> 40:38.781
- Tell her we miss her?
- And ask her when she's coming home.

40:39.980 --> 40:43.861
Hey you...it's not forever.

40:43.901 --> 40:46.941
Just for a couple of months,
till l get my head sorted.

40:49.340 --> 40:51.061
SOMEONE SCREAMS

40:51.100 --> 40:52.421
What the...?

40:56.980 --> 40:57.981
Mind!

40:58.020 --> 40:59.021
Get him!

41:02.220 --> 41:03.621
Hey! Hey, come here!

41:03.661 --> 41:06.261
Come here you dirty...

41:06.300 --> 41:08.381
Mum, what's the matter?

41:08.421 --> 41:11.061
Oh, no, no. Don't look at me.

41:12.501 --> 41:14.341
I'm too ashamed. >

41:14.380 --> 41:15.941
Carol, what's he done to you?

41:15.980 --> 41:19.541
l'm a disgusting human being.

41:22.421 --> 41:26.101
l only wanted to please him,
Veronica.

41:26.140 --> 41:30.581
He said it was an erotic massage.

41:30.621 --> 41:31.981
lf l'd any idea... >

41:32.020 --> 41:34.181
What the bleedin' hell has he done?

41:34.220 --> 41:36.061
< Carol, what is it?

41:38.940 --> 41:41.861
He went to the bathroom on me.

41:41.901 --> 41:45.741
Oh, Jesus!

41:45.781 --> 41:51.461
You're right,
l am a terrible mother.

41:51.501 --> 41:54.901
Oh... It's all right,
just go and get in the shower.

Starting with her.

44:12.220 --> 44:13.981
You'll have to go through me first.

44:14.020 --> 44:17.861
Cos l'd rather die than lose her.

44:17.901 --> 44:19.421
You don't mean that.

44:19.461 --> 44:20.941
Try me.

44:24.260 --> 44:27.821
You wouldn't kill the father
of your child, would you Roxy?

44:29.621 --> 44:31.781
You made it up, didn't you?

44:31.821 --> 44:35.141
How could you lie
about something like that?

44:35.180 --> 44:36.621
You crazy fucking bitch.

44:40.621 --> 44:44.021
Nobody attacks my daughter.

44:44.060 --> 44:45.661
l'll call the police.

44:52.461 --> 44:53.581
Fuck om!

44:53.621 --> 44:56.341
Come on now, settle down.
Settle down.

44:56.380 --> 44:58.501
Calm down. Stop struggling.

44:58.541 --> 45:00.421
You're doing yourself no favours.

45:00.461 --> 45:03.421
Fuck om!

45:03.461 --> 45:06.061
Right into the car. Watch your head.

45:10.741 --> 45:12.981

45:14.020 --> 45:15.861

45:17.421 --> 45:19.501
l was confused.

45:19.541 --> 45:22.181
We didn't have sex. l couldn't.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.621
lt's not the point, is it?

45:24.661 --> 45:26.301
You wanted to.

45:26.340 --> 45:29.021
No. It meant nothing. None of it.

45:31.821 --> 45:34.381
But the last few days
has made me realise

45:34.421 --> 45:40.981
what we've got, me and you,
it's like gold dust.

45:42.581 --> 45:44.741

46:01.821 --> 46:02.821
Don't do this. >

46:02.861 --> 46:04.621
l have got no choice!

46:06.180 --> 46:09.301
Everything we had
was based on trust.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.301
And you have ruined that.

46:11.340 --> 46:13.941
We will never go back
to the way it was before.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.781

46:17.821 --> 46:19.981

46:52.020 --> 46:54.061

46:55.621 --> 46:58.661

46:58.701 --> 47:01.341
The only kid l ever want's with you.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.021
How the fuck can l leave?

47:32.781 --> 47:34.861

if you wanna give God a laugh,

47:54.020 --> 47:56.021
'tell Him your plans.

47:56.060 --> 48:00.261
'My philosophy is,
never get too comfy,

48:00.300 --> 48:04.461
'because it doesn't matter who you are,
if the whirlwind comes your way,

48:04.501 --> 48:06.661
'it's gonna tear your world apart.

48:06.701 --> 48:10.541
'And the only thing you can do
is cling on tight#

48:18.220 --> 48:21.141
l suppose you're fucking happy,
aren't you!

48:21.180 --> 48:22.941
When did all this turn into a war?

48:22.980 --> 48:25.221
l thought we could have
had something.

48:25.260 --> 48:27.461
Where the fuck is my Mandy?

48:27.501 --> 48:28.981

48:29.020 --> 48:32.181
