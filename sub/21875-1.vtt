02:21.600 --> 02:24.300
Yo, Ned,
good to see you, bro!

02:24.310 --> 02:25.640
( laughs )

02:25.640 --> 02:27.810
Damn, Roy, I can't believe
that you called me.

02:27.810 --> 02:30.280
I can't believe
you're not in Tulsa.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.710
I mean, isn't that
like jumping bail or something?

02:32.710 --> 02:34.410
Ain't you even glad
to see me, boy?

02:34.420 --> 02:35.850
Couldn't imagine
what held you up.

02:35.850 --> 02:38.750
Nothing held me up.
I held it up.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.490
Have a look
in there, boy.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.930
Yahoo!

02:44.930 --> 02:46.960
My God, Ray, what are you doing?

02:46.960 --> 02:48.930
Are you trying to start
something up or something?

02:48.930 --> 02:51.460
I ain't startin' nothin' up,
Ned. That's the finish.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.800
That's for Pa.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.740
I'm gonna tell you
where you can find the rest.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.740
No, Roy. You're in
enough trouble as it is.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.970
Okay?

03:02.510 --> 03:04.710
He wouldn't want this
from you, anyway.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.150
Well, I want you to give
it to him. Don't tell him
it's from me.

03:07.150 --> 03:10.020
I gotta get back to Tulsa before
they find out I'm gone.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.220
I want you to take that.
You find the rest.

03:12.220 --> 03:13.990
Y'all give Star a call
this afternoon.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.120
She's waiting
to hear on you.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.660
You let her know
it's done.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.130
WALKER:
Uncle Ray,
I really don't have time

03:25.130 --> 03:26.630
to go all the way out
to the reservation

03:26.640 --> 03:28.700
and participate
in these Indian games.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.040
Washoe, it's important
that you make time.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.270
You must keep alive the part
of you that is Cherokee.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.540
Then High Hawk's
gonna have me race

03:35.540 --> 03:37.010
against his top riders again.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.110
He is anxious
to challenge you again,

03:39.110 --> 03:41.180
and it would give you
an opportunity to speak.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.250
Remember, he likes to laugh.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.690
Uncle Ray, I'm not gonna tell
any of your jokes.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.550
High Hawk likes my jokes.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.260
And he's heard all your jokes.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.360
Well, he hasn't heard this one.
You wanna hear it?

03:51.360 --> 03:53.260
Why not?
You're gonna tell me anyway.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.360
This tribe worked real hard

03:55.360 --> 03:57.560
to send one of the chief's sons
off to college,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.700
on the promise
that when he returned,

03:59.700 --> 04:01.030
he'll use his
newfound knowledge

04:01.040 --> 04:04.000
for the advancement
of his people.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.670
So he got an electrical
engineering degree,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.010
and when he returned,
one of his first deeds

04:10.010 --> 04:13.010
was to wire electric light
for the outhouse,

04:13.010 --> 04:15.520
because the tribe was tripping
out there in the dark.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.820
So he-- He became known
as one of the first Indians

04:18.820 --> 04:20.750
to wire a head
for a reservation.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
( laughs )

04:21.760 --> 04:22.760
Get it?

04:22.760 --> 04:24.690
Wire-- Wire a head
for a reservation.

04:24.690 --> 04:26.360
Yeah, I get it,
Uncle Ray.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.660
I got a million of them.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.880
Well, you boys were sure moving
along there, weren't you?

04:44.880 --> 04:47.050
Sorry, pard. Uh, we've been
making the run back

04:47.050 --> 04:48.450
from Tulsa all night.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.320
Hasn't been anyone <i> </i>
on the road.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.150
After doing 80 all night
and no one on the road,

04:52.150 --> 04:53.350
you kinda lose track of speed.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.060
All the way
from Tulsa, nonstop?

04:56.060 --> 04:57.560
You got it.
Mmm.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.560
Well, you sure made
some hellacious mileage.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.500
The tank's still full.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.570
You boys mind stepping
out of the car?

05:05.570 --> 05:06.570
( horse whinnies )

05:06.570 --> 05:08.030
Washoe,
the horse is okay.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.700
( car engine starts )

05:12.640 --> 05:14.470
UNCLE RAY:
Guess they didn't
want the ticket.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.880
Wahoo!

05:15.880 --> 05:17.540
All right.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.080
What you go
and do that for?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.350
Just kick back, little bro.
That Ranger's got nothing to do

05:21.350 --> 05:25.020
but polish the road dust off
his badge and wait for a ride.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.820
( horse whinnies )

05:26.820 --> 05:29.320
You're never gonna
catch them on horseback.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.190
Won't know unless I try.

05:32.330 --> 05:36.330
(<i> adventurous theme playing</i> )

06:01.760 --> 06:04.290
Now, we gotta make sure
we take care of it first.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.030
And then we go to Pa.
Roy...

06:08.030 --> 06:09.130
We can't tell him first.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.060
Otherwise, he'll never
go for it.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.400
Roy!
What?

06:14.570 --> 06:17.040
Grab the money, Ned.
Grab it!

06:20.480 --> 06:21.710
Go! Now!

06:21.710 --> 06:23.480
( grunts )

06:25.510 --> 06:27.580
Hyah. Hyah.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.920
WALKER:
Come on. Get out of there, kid.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.090
ROY:
Ah!

06:37.090 --> 06:38.320
Don't even
think of it, now.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.460
( grunts )
Don't do that.

06:39.460 --> 06:40.960
Ooh. Oh!

06:42.700 --> 06:43.830
Sorry I had to do that.

06:46.070 --> 06:48.630
( coughs )

06:49.540 --> 06:50.540
( groans )

06:50.540 --> 06:52.070

06:52.070 --> 06:53.110

Hee-hoo!

07:18.470 --> 07:21.930
( giggles )

07:21.940 --> 07:25.870
Get along, little doggie.
And me without a camera, man.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.170
Don't even start with me.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.840
See, I never believed them
when they said you put pants on

07:29.850 --> 07:31.110
one leg at a time.

07:31.110 --> 07:33.080
Gosh, you're my hero, big guy.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.580
Yeah.
Oh!

07:34.580 --> 07:35.580
Whoa. Whoa.

Oh, man.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.520
Whew.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.920
Look...

07:42.920 --> 07:45.290
you don't mind taking
the prisoner in for me, do you?

07:45.290 --> 07:46.290
No. No.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.960
Good. And...

07:47.960 --> 07:49.160
here's his weapon.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.160
Thank you.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.430

ATM robberies

08:10.790 --> 08:12.820
You and your brother have
taken down close to, what?

08:12.820 --> 08:14.120
Two hundred and fifty grand.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.560
I don't know what
you're mouthing about.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.560
I'm a hardworking,
law-abiding citizen.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.560
Woo-hoo!

08:20.560 --> 08:22.860
You're smug.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.730
You don't want
an attorney or anything?

08:24.730 --> 08:26.330
No, I, could use some doughnuts

08:26.330 --> 08:28.300
to go with this, uh,
stale coffee, but...

08:28.300 --> 08:30.570
I don't need a lawyer.
I didn't do nothing.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.640
I'll tell you what, though,
let's take it to court.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.970
You present your case.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.080
What are you gonna do
when they find your fingerprints

08:36.080 --> 08:37.710
all over the ATM
that was boosted?

08:37.710 --> 08:39.010
I think we both know

08:39.010 --> 08:41.210
my prints aren't gonna
be anywhere at all.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.620
Don't we?

08:42.620 --> 08:44.150
I'll tell you what--

08:45.920 --> 08:48.690
Well, what do we do now, boys?

08:53.330 --> 08:55.830
I think maybe you and I
have a little talk...

08:57.370 --> 08:58.800
Texas-style.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.330
Oh, good. That means
I'm out of here.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.740
What are you
talkin' about?

09:02.740 --> 09:04.100
Where's he going?
Where you going?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.340
To get your doughnuts.

09:05.340 --> 09:07.910
You like the ones
with the soft center, right?

09:10.110 --> 09:11.710
( door closes )

09:13.150 --> 09:15.580
You don't scare me.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.750
I mean, you guys
are Rangers.

09:16.750 --> 09:17.850
You ain't
gonna do nothing.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.190
( crashes to the floor )

09:25.960 --> 09:28.460
Did you drop something,
Roy, besides yourself?

09:28.460 --> 09:29.760
You don't scare me!

09:29.760 --> 09:30.800
You can't threaten me!

09:30.800 --> 09:33.230
Did you threaten
this prisoner, Walker?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.230
You're damn right
he did.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.000
How did he threaten you.
Mr. Buchanon?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.910
Well, he, uh...
Sat down.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.510
Well, the other guy,
he left! He--

09:40.510 --> 09:42.710
Went to get his doughnuts.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.850
How long you gonna
keep me here?

09:46.850 --> 09:49.220
You're free to go
whenever you choose.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.250
Wait a minute.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.720
We can't hold him
any longer.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.920
I chased this kid
halfway to Houston.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.320
You had no probable cause,
Walker.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.830
His gas tank was full?

09:58.830 --> 10:02.060
Please, we'd get laughed
right out of the arraignment.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.630
So, uh, this lovely lady's
saying I might be on my way.

10:05.630 --> 10:09.640
The DA is saying shove off
before your luck turns.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.110
I don't believe this, Alex.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.250
I really don't believe this.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.210
So how'd you do?

10:22.220 --> 10:24.950
Michelle Pfeiffer's
got nothing on me.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.090
Ah, he went for it,
didn't he?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.390
( Alex giggles )

10:27.390 --> 10:28.990
What are you two up to?

10:28.990 --> 10:31.120
We weren't getting
anywhere with the kid, right?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.530
So I came up with a plan.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.860
I'm gonna let Roy
lead us to his brother

10:34.860 --> 10:37.130
and then, eventually,
the money.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.930
Dare I ask what the plan is?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.930
It's beautiful.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.740
We just follow
the bouncing ball.

10:44.570 --> 10:47.740
Follow the bouncing ball?

10:47.740 --> 10:49.280
( beeping )

10:49.280 --> 10:51.750
TRIVETTE:
I planted a LoJack on the bumper
of his impounded car.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.650
So if we don't get too close
and spook him,

10:54.650 --> 10:56.620
he takes us to where
X marks the spot.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.350
Huh?

10:58.350 --> 10:59.350
Is that
a beautiful plan?

10:59.350 --> 11:00.350
( yips )

11:00.360 --> 11:02.150
Whoa. Where you going?

11:02.160 --> 11:03.420
I'm going to take a look.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.060
No. That's what's so great
about the plan.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.560
We're looking at him
right here, see?

11:06.560 --> 11:08.230
He can't make a move
without us knowing it.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.260
I wanna see him
in person.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.500
You're so dang stubborn.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.740
You have no faith
in me, Walker!

11:16.740 --> 11:20.370
(<i> guitar theme playing</i> )

11:20.380 --> 11:22.110
He'll be back.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.220
( beeping )

11:35.220 --> 11:37.320
Come on. He's on the move.
Let's go.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.260
What are you doing?
Come on. Let's go!

11:41.030 --> 11:43.760
Now, look, see.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.370
He's moving south
in the parking lot.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.470
He's going--

11:47.470 --> 11:48.930
Oh, get down!

11:48.940 --> 11:50.240
Come on. He's gonna see.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.370
Get down.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.220
Well, guess we move
to plan B, then.

That was an expensive piece
of equipment.

12:22.940 --> 12:23.970
Didn't work like one.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.040
Do you think that they know
we're after them?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.650
I don't think they know
we're after them.

12:32.650 --> 12:34.980
Do you think they know?
Look, you wanna drive?

12:46.560 --> 12:49.130
Watch it!
( horns honking )

12:50.400 --> 12:52.270
You did that on purpose.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.150
Oh, what? You and Trigger
could have done better?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.190
Thanks for the lift, Mick.

that damn Universal

out there this morning.

down that one rabbit hole

13:43.990 --> 13:45.050

of the pants...

13:49.560 --> 13:50.820
Oh, lordy.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.160
I can't never
get me enough of that

the wrong place, partner.

13:59.070 --> 14:02.370
Oh, I'd never smell out
the wrong hound's butt, hoss.

You Roy Buchanon, ain't you?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.210
of the Denton Buchanons?

14:07.210 --> 14:10.880
You done upped and run
on Eddie Hatcher, boy.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.480
You know you don't skip
when Eddie posts your bail.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.480
Look, I was gonna come back.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.280
I just had me something to do,
that's all.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.150

leave such things lying about,

out there and all.

Come on, partner,
we oughta be able to...

14:42.810 --> 14:43.980
work something out.

14:43.980 --> 14:47.850
I mean, you just tell Eddie I--

14:47.850 --> 14:49.880
I just need
a couple more days. Ooh!

14:49.880 --> 14:52.890
What you need, boy,
is to make old Boo happy

14:52.890 --> 14:55.090
by telling him
what he wants to hear.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.360
Now, you can do that,
can't you?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.990
Why, shoot.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.260
If a little, old cartoon
can make me happy,

you sure can, can't you?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.370
Come on, Trivette.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.440
I got an address
on the Buchanon kid.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.670
Eh? This is disgusting, man.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.610

in this hard drive,

15:14.610 --> 15:16.640
you owe me for it.
You hear that?

15:22.650 --> 15:24.150
Now, why don't you just
be a good bugger

15:24.150 --> 15:25.380
and tell me
where that money is.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.390
If you ain't got it,
you gave it to somebody.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.920
Who? Your little brother, maybe?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.320
Mmm.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.160
Or, maybe, that cute girlie

15:32.160 --> 15:33.190
Oh, yeah. I know about her.

15:33.190 --> 15:35.390
Don't hurt anyone.

15:37.030 --> 15:40.270
Now, you are truly trying
my good patience here, boy.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.400
So spit it out,
or I'll wail on you some more.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
I can keep this up all day.

Now, let's just take this
at a slow trot, now.

The name's Waxwell,

16:10.360 --> 16:11.560
Boone Waxwell.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.230
My paper is in
my right hip pocket there.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.100
I got my gun permit
in there too.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.440
Everything's nice and legal.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.110
How about in your left boot?

16:21.110 --> 16:22.940
Ooh-hoo.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.580
You got Injun eyes
there, Ranger.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.350
And, yes, sir,
I got me a license

16:26.350 --> 16:27.910
for that little puppy too.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.420
"Boone Waxwell."

16:35.760 --> 16:38.420
Yes, sirree, Bob.
You see, right there,

16:38.430 --> 16:41.290
I got me a legit right to that
sack o' trash lyin' yonder.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.900
He jumped bail in Tulsa
on Eddie Hatcher.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.330
Give him a call.
He'll tell it all.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.400
Don't worry, we will.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.800
Then, I got me
nothing to fret about.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.570
Doesn't say anything
about dead or alive, Waxwell.

16:49.570 --> 16:52.140
Well, I don't get met
by the welcome wagon

16:52.140 --> 16:53.610
in my line of work.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.980
It was self-defense,
plain and simple.

16:55.980 --> 16:58.680
When people wind up dead,
it's never plain or simple.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.350
Why, whatever you
hinting at, Ranger?

17:00.350 --> 17:02.180
The kid was left-handed.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.880
He a southpaw?

17:05.349 --> 17:07.920
So why did he try to shoot you
with his right hand, Waxwell?

17:07.920 --> 17:11.589
( chuckles ):
I was too busy ducking
and saving my biscuits

17:11.589 --> 17:13.290
to ask him why he's firing
with which hand.

17:13.290 --> 17:14.829
Maybe he's one of them
amphibious guys.

17:14.829 --> 17:15.829
Can use either hand.

17:15.829 --> 17:17.859
Ambidextrous.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.630
Yeah.

17:19.630 --> 17:21.930
That's what I meant.

17:21.940 --> 17:25.000
Ambidextrous.
I'm gonna write that down.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.640
Well, while you're at it,
write this down:

17:26.640 --> 17:28.740
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.840
If you give up that right,
anything you say

17:30.840 --> 17:32.740
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.080
Oh, what y'all
doin' this for?

to an attorney.

Now, we're all weari''

17:37.520 --> 17:40.350
Do you understand these rights
as they have been given to you?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.790
Yeah.

Yeah, I think I do.

Seems your story
checks out, Mr. Waxwell.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.900
Why, sure, and why
wouldn't it, ma'am?

That still leaves us
with one dead kid.

Clutching a gun
in the wrong hand.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.280
Like I told your Ranger here,
I don't get no written exam,

18:10.280 --> 18:12.690
so I don't likely know which
hand he fires with normally,

18:12.690 --> 18:14.650
just what he fired
at me with.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.790
Just one of those
unlucky breaks.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.190
Not for you.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.890
That's my favorite kind.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.700
Seems to me, a lot of bad luck
follows your tail, Waxwell.

You're the busiest
skip tracer in five states.

18:26.700 --> 18:31.140
Did you know that out of 25
bounties in the past two years,

18:31.140 --> 18:33.110
you brought in 18 dead.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.370
Is that a fact?

18:34.380 --> 18:37.140
Yeah. Very much a fact.
A cold, hard fact.

WAXWELL:
Law enforcement's
a risky game.

18:39.350 --> 18:42.310
I never thought of it as much
of a game, Mr. Waxwell.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.680
Excuse my indelicate choice of
words, ma'am, but if you check,

18:44.690 --> 18:47.390
you'll find
all those warrants are good.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.920
No problem with any local law
in any of the counties I worked.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.290
And I sure hope not
to have any here.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.560
I hope not, either.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.860
Then I can go?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.200
You're free.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.230
I need to clean up some.

18:59.230 --> 19:00.230

19:00.230 --> 19:02.400
but with nearly
getting killed and all.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.540

19:03.540 --> 19:04.740
Yeah, where you came from.

19:04.740 --> 19:05.740
I'd be willing to bet

19:05.740 --> 19:07.340
we're not gonna be friends.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.170
I'd be willing to bet
if you don't leave my town,

19:09.180 --> 19:10.580
we're gonna be
downright enemies.

Walker, I know
that guy is slime,

run people outta town.

What I'm not understanding

19:48.780 --> 19:50.850
is why we would have to.

This guy's m.o. was "tag 'em,
bag 'em, and shove off," right?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.320
Then why's he sticking
around here?

thirty-two thousand

and seventy-two dollars

20:17.710 --> 20:20.310
is the exact unrecovered amount
from all the ATM robberies.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.650
So if the Buchanon boys
pulled all the jobs,

20:22.650 --> 20:25.180
that's the missing stash
that Ned's sitting on.

20:25.190 --> 20:29.390
Maybe that's what our old buddy
Boo is trying to sniff out.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.860
It's the only thing
that would track.

All right,
all the other bounties

20:39.070 --> 20:42.730
that Waxwell's taken down were
for really pretty hefty sums.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.040
Let me see, the last three

20:45.040 --> 20:49.670
were for 23, 18 and a half
and 46 grand.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.710
So why else would he bother
with Roy Buchanon

20:51.710 --> 20:54.210
when the payoff for that bounty
was only five grand?

20:54.220 --> 20:55.710
Looks like we better find
Ned Buchanon

we can call for you, sir,

21:04.860 --> 21:07.690
There's nobody, just me and Ned.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.360
We took care of each other,
the two of us.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.730
That's what we done.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.740
You know, Ned made me
this here wheelchair.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.740
He scrounged up parts...

21:19.740 --> 21:22.640
and even tooled some himself.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.510
Do you think Ned
will come back here?

know what to do.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.820
Not what to do.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.020
He's not like Roy.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.290
You can bet
that if my Ned's

21:35.290 --> 21:36.690
even the slightest
mixed up in this,

21:36.690 --> 21:43.060
it's all because
of that no-good brother of his.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.570
Ned, he-- He wouldn't know
how to find trouble.

21:46.570 --> 21:48.900

He was too smart, Roy.

on the wrong end of things.

he set a mind to.

He could've helped me
hold onto this farm

22:06.720 --> 22:09.020

22:09.020 --> 22:11.090
Not now, though.

Hey.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.110
Looks like the tornado
that carried Dorothy

23:06.110 --> 23:07.750

23:07.750 --> 23:09.080
Said I didn't
see nothing.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.580
This nothing
you didn't see,

23:10.580 --> 23:12.480
was he about 6 foot tall,
black cowboy hat

23:12.490 --> 23:15.650
and built like
a refrigerator?

23:17.890 --> 23:19.930
But I didn't say nothing,
you hear?

23:19.930 --> 23:21.430
I didn't say a thing.

23:21.430 --> 23:22.930
That's for sure.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.830
Did he take her
with him?

23:24.830 --> 23:25.830
Uh-uh.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.830
She'd already
gone to work.

23:27.830 --> 23:29.330
And I told him.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.840
I told him she was gone.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.740
He just came out
and kicked the door in,

23:33.740 --> 23:34.970
and...

23:36.340 --> 23:38.510
I didn't see nothing.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.680
(<i> slow guitar theme playing</i> )

23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
Guess what?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.180
He didn't see nothing.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.480
You got it.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.350
MAN:
I told you.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.790
She went to get
her dry cleaning.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.160
We're usually
not very busy early,

23:53.160 --> 23:54.160
so she takes her time.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.330
WALKER:
Is there a problem?

23:56.330 --> 23:58.600
No problem at all.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.030
You were just examining

24:00.030 --> 24:02.530
the texture of his beard, right?
( chuckles )

24:02.540 --> 24:04.140
Did this man
assault you?

24:04.140 --> 24:05.140
No, no.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.140
Everything's fine.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.370
What can I do
for you guys?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.580
Give me a brewski,

24:16.220 --> 24:18.220
Well, I was driving by, and...

24:18.220 --> 24:20.220
I liked the name.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.520
Why don't you
get back in your rig

24:21.520 --> 24:22.990
and keep on driving by?

find me a place

I surely do.

you could help us out.

This is gonna
destroy Ned.

They--

25:52.780 --> 25:54.680
They were so close.

So close.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.850
We hate to push you, Star,

to get ahold of Ned.

you're scared of me,

Is that your mama?

Mmm.

She's pretty.

you know I'll come back

28:42.820 --> 28:45.520

that this was anything more
than a dinner invitation,

did I abduct you?

for a reservation.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.490
He's gonna give me
a heart attack.

29:58.490 --> 30:01.290
That's the funniest man
I ever saw in my life.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.560
Yeah, he's just
a barrel of laughs.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.830

30:09.340 --> 30:10.640
if Trivette calls,

tell him I went to see Alex
at County Hospital.

Yeah, okay, yeah.
Jimmy. Yeah, I got it.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.650
He could make it
as a stand-up comic.

30:21.650 --> 30:22.680
Who?

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
Your Uncle Ray.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.290
I'm thinking about
featuring him Friday night

30:27.290 --> 30:28.350
before Delbert comes on.

ALEX:
I thought
it was another assault.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.470
When I got here
and got an I.D.,

30:44.470 --> 30:47.170
I called dispatch
to find you.

30:55.580 --> 30:56.620
Ms. Buckley,

30:56.620 --> 30:59.920
what has happened to you
is a terrible,

30:59.920 --> 31:01.290
terrible thing,

31:01.290 --> 31:05.620
and the person who did this
to you should be punished,

31:05.630 --> 31:07.360
but we can't do that
without your help.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.390
Please.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.900
C-could you just
go away?

31:10.900 --> 31:14.230
I-- I just want you
to go away.

31:14.230 --> 31:16.200
I know who did this
to you, Star.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.200
It was Boone Waxwell.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.400
I didn't say that,

31:18.410 --> 31:20.440
I didn't tell you
nothing of the sort.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.970
I know he's the one
that did it,

31:21.980 --> 31:23.910
and you're not the first one
he's done it to.

31:23.910 --> 31:26.450
Then why's he still
out there doing it?

31:26.450 --> 31:28.950
Not that I'm saying
he done anything to me.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.620
But why don't you arrest him?

31:30.620 --> 31:32.780
Because there are
never any witnesses.

31:32.790 --> 31:33.850
Like yourself,

31:33.850 --> 31:35.890
nobody's gonna
testify against him.

31:35.890 --> 31:38.060
WALKER:
Waxwell operates on fear.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.330
He counts on that
to keep people from talking,

31:40.330 --> 31:43.360
and if we don't stop him,
he's gonna get Ned.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.900
And believe me, you don't
want that to happen.

31:45.900 --> 31:49.870
What I want is for y'all
to go away...

31:49.870 --> 31:50.870
now.

31:50.870 --> 31:53.870
I just wanna be left alone.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.370
Where's my doctor?

31:55.380 --> 31:56.980
Can I have my doctor?

31:58.110 --> 31:59.650
I'm in pain.

31:59.650 --> 32:02.910
Doesn't anyone care
that I've been hurt?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.380
Sure, we do.

32:04.390 --> 32:08.050

anyone else to get hurt.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.460

does this to people?

32:16.460 --> 32:18.960
The kind that crawl
on their bellies. Snakes.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.730

of them all.

32:23.470 --> 32:24.640
Thank you.

32:26.670 --> 32:28.770
Doesn't somebody need their
medication or something?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.610
What did I do?

32:34.650 --> 32:36.080
Walker.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.950
TRIVETTE:
<i> Yeah, it's Trivette.</i>

32:37.950 --> 32:38.950

32:38.950 --> 32:40.950
<i> Can you get out here?</i>

32:40.950 --> 32:43.450
All right. I'll pick you
right up.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.890
That was Trivette.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.390
He spotted Waxwell's car.

32:46.390 --> 32:47.630
He's still in town?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.560
Yeah, and he's not
even trying to hide.

indistinctly)

33:00.670 --> 33:01.970
WAXWELL:
Do us a favor, partner,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.470
and find yourself
another phone, eh?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.110
There are
no other phones.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.780
Besides, this is a public phone.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.450
All right, look.
I know you can't tell

33:08.450 --> 33:10.450
by looking at my natural,
good-natured appearance,

33:10.450 --> 33:12.650
but I'm tellin' you,
I'm out of good temper today.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.150
So unless you're gonna
use that phone

33:14.150 --> 33:15.820
to call an ambulance,
I'd skedaddle, okay?

33:15.820 --> 33:17.260
You like that?
All right!

33:17.260 --> 33:18.890
Get out of here.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.160
Thank you
for your cooperation.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.200
( rings )

33:29.200 --> 33:30.200
Hello. Brownie's.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.840
Uh... Uh, let me
speak to Star.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.910
Uh, well, you know,
we're packed in here right now,

33:35.910 --> 33:37.980
and she's moving like a cat
with her tail afire.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.380
Could you just, uh...?

33:39.380 --> 33:41.510
Could you tell her
it's Ned?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.650
<i> Ned?</i>
Mm-hm.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.180
<i> Well,</i>
<i> I'll tell her, but--</i>

33:44.180 --> 33:45.580
<i> Hang on.</i>

33:47.420 --> 33:49.220
♪ La-dee-da, la-dee-da
Dee-dee-da ♪

33:49.220 --> 33:51.090
♪ Ned's calling
La-da-da-dee-dee-da ♪

33:51.090 --> 33:53.190
♪ Da-doo-doo-doo ♪

33:53.190 --> 33:54.360
"Ned," did you say?

33:54.360 --> 33:56.060
Yeah.
Where--? Where's Star?

33:56.060 --> 33:58.360
I'm sorry, boy, but old man
Pickens has got his eye on her,

33:58.370 --> 33:59.460
and he said
there's no way

33:59.470 --> 34:01.130
she can come
to the phone right now.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.540
Well, she says leave a message,
or-- Or call back tomorrow.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.640
<i> Tomorrow's no good.</i>

34:04.640 --> 34:06.200
I can't--
I can't do it tomorrow.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.270
Uh, listen,
c-could you--?

34:09.280 --> 34:11.510
Could you
tell her, um...?

34:11.510 --> 34:12.880
Uh...?

34:12.880 --> 34:14.050
Denton.

34:14.050 --> 34:17.880
Third and Main
at 9 a.m.?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.250
Okay.

34:23.489 --> 34:25.760
Gotcha.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.790
Well, howdy-do there,
Mr. Texas Ranger, sir?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.560
I just came
from the hospital, Waxwell.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.469
I got a look at some
of your recent handiwork.

34:33.469 --> 34:36.130
Well, I don't know whatever it
is you're talking about, Walker.

34:36.139 --> 34:39.239
Don't worry, you're doing real
good at scaring little girls.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.670
It seems Star
was too afraid to ID you.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.110
ID me?

34:43.110 --> 34:46.310
For what? You really do
talk in riddles, Trivette.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.550
I'm a poor,
simple country boy.

34:47.550 --> 34:49.050
You gonna have to
spell it out for me.

34:49.050 --> 34:50.480
We know why
you're here, Waxwell.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.820
TRIVETTE:
You want Ned Buchanon,

34:51.820 --> 34:53.790
and you want that
quarter of a million dollars

34:53.790 --> 34:54.790
his brother stole.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.090
So while you're
in our burg,

34:56.090 --> 34:58.760
I'm gonna be all over you
like a wet burnoose.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.690
That's harassment.
That's what that's called.

35:00.690 --> 35:01.760
Call it
whatever you want.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.090
Because you're
not going

35:03.100 --> 35:05.800
anywhere near that kid
without an audience, Waxwell.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.600
( scoffs )
Well, Jes--

35:07.600 --> 35:09.530
Why, heck, I don't
know what this is all about.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.970
You know,
I wouldn't even mind

35:10.970 --> 35:13.070
a little police protection,
what with what's going on

35:13.070 --> 35:14.610
out in those streets
in this day and age.

35:14.610 --> 35:15.840
I'll tell you what.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.210
I'm gonna save you
some time.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.480
I'll give you
my itinerary.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.750
Itinerary.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.850
I-tin-er-ar-y.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.720
Well,
that's pretty near damn near

35:24.720 --> 35:27.050
as good a word as
old "ambidextrous,"
isn't that, Trivette?

35:27.050 --> 35:28.490
Don't you think?

35:28.490 --> 35:30.560
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.890
First, I wanna
get out of here,

35:31.890 --> 35:33.660
and find me a place
with some real local color

35:33.660 --> 35:34.830
and get me
a real drink.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.190
Then I'm gonna
rustle me up

35:36.200 --> 35:38.560
one of them delicious
three-inch steaks from Texas

35:38.570 --> 35:39.900
I'm hearing so much about.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.270
And then,
I'm gonna wander off

35:41.270 --> 35:42.930
to one of them
gentlemen's naked bars.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.240
So you boys
better get some 20's

35:44.240 --> 35:45.870
to give them
dancy girlies for tips.

35:45.870 --> 35:47.510
And I'll see you
at the next watering hole.

35:47.510 --> 35:48.710
( clicks tongue )

35:48.710 --> 35:50.780
(<i> slow guitar theme playing</i> )

35:56.250 --> 35:58.250
Burnoose?

35:58.250 --> 36:00.320
( rock music
playing over speaker )

36:00.320 --> 36:02.020
( chattering )

36:02.020 --> 36:03.290
( men shouting )

36:13.400 --> 36:14.530
WOMAN:
I'm gonna give my all.

36:14.530 --> 36:16.100
MAN:
Hey, what's up?

36:16.100 --> 36:17.340
MAN 2:
All right.
Pretty good.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.740
That's your hog
over there, right?

36:18.740 --> 36:20.140
WOMAN:
I don't have
to answer...

36:20.140 --> 36:21.240
TRIVETTE:
<i> Walker, come in.</i>

36:21.240 --> 36:22.940
Walker.
<i> I just followed</i>

36:22.940 --> 36:25.080
this bozo to a place
called the Wrecking Bar.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
I'm think
I'm gonna go in.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.410
I know that place.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.350
Don't go in until
I get there, Trivette.

36:29.350 --> 36:31.120
I'm on my way.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.720
( men shouting indistinctly )

36:39.730 --> 36:43.090
( rock music
playing over jukebox )

36:43.100 --> 36:45.260
Can I get a beer,
please?

36:45.270 --> 36:47.200
MAN:
Hey, get out
of the bar.

36:50.170 --> 36:52.670
( jeering )

36:58.010 --> 36:59.240
Howdy-do, boys?

36:59.250 --> 37:00.850
Howdy-do?
What's up?

37:00.850 --> 37:01.850
What you doing here?

37:01.850 --> 37:03.050
I'm just wondering
if you boys

37:03.050 --> 37:06.080
might not like to do me
a little favor.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.620
Why don't I ever
listen to him?

37:24.370 --> 37:26.000
There some kind
of a problem?

37:26.770 --> 37:29.410
Oh.
Guess so.

37:29.410 --> 37:30.910
I don't suppose
it would do any good

37:30.910 --> 37:32.540
to tell you boys
I'm a Texas Ranger.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.350
Yeah, and I'm Davy Crockett.
( laughs )

37:34.350 --> 37:36.180
Welcome to the Alamo.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.720
Excuse me, guys.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.150
<i> ♪ I apolo-golo-gize ♪</i>

37:41.150 --> 37:44.690
<i> ♪ You know I put</i>
<i> My bike on the line... ♪</i>

37:44.690 --> 37:45.690
You never listen to me.

37:45.690 --> 37:48.160
Hey, I have this
under control.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.230
Let me ask you something.

37:49.230 --> 37:50.800
Have you ever seen
so many specimens

37:50.800 --> 37:52.830
so low on the food chain?

37:52.830 --> 37:55.200
I hope you're good
at making friends.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.870
Hey, I'm a regular
social butterfly, man.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.070
( grunts )

38:07.810 --> 38:09.150
Karate, huh?

38:12.550 --> 38:14.550
Walk...
( screaming )

38:30.840 --> 38:32.140
( yells indistinctly )

38:34.040 --> 38:35.040
Walker!

38:43.150 --> 38:44.780
All right,
where'd he go now?

38:44.790 --> 38:46.450
I don't know.

38:46.450 --> 38:47.950
But I know
Star knows something.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.520
I'm going back
to the hospital.

38:50.490 --> 38:51.990
We gotta find
that kid first.

38:54.930 --> 38:59.560
WOMAN ( over PA ):
<i> Dr. Wickland, please call 2468.</i>
<i> Dr. Wickland...</i>

38:59.570 --> 39:01.030
Ned?

39:01.030 --> 39:02.030
Did you find Ned?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.430
Is--? Is he okay?

39:03.440 --> 39:04.440
Is he...?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.870
Dead? No.

39:06.870 --> 39:09.070
But I can't help him
unless you help me.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.910
I-- I told you, I don't know
anything. I don't.

39:11.910 --> 39:14.180
I know you told
something to Waxwell.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.950
I know you did.

39:15.950 --> 39:19.750
Now, I went out
to see Ned's pa yesterday.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.720
I told him about Roy.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.650
He's really worried
about Ned.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.320
Ned, yeah.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.390
Ned, Ned, Ned.

39:26.390 --> 39:28.530
That's all it ever was
for their daddy.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.130
Like Roy didn't exist.

39:30.130 --> 39:31.730
But it was Roy
who saw how much

39:31.730 --> 39:33.600
the farm meant
to their dad,

39:33.600 --> 39:35.700
how those bankers
with their suits and computers

39:35.700 --> 39:38.170
was killing him.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.570
The farm?

39:39.570 --> 39:40.770
What are you
talking about?

39:40.770 --> 39:43.210
Don't you see?
Don't you get it?

39:43.210 --> 39:46.580
That's why Roy was robbing
all them banks.

39:46.580 --> 39:48.780
To stop the foreclosure
on the farm.

39:48.780 --> 39:52.520
All he ever hit
was Southern Star Bank branches.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.520
He was gonna pay them back
with their own money

39:54.520 --> 39:56.720
for what they done
to his dad.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.820
None of it was for Roy.
None of it.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.330
I know you're afraid
of Boone Waxwell,

40:01.330 --> 40:04.090
but he killed
Roy Buchanon for the money,

40:04.100 --> 40:06.730
and he won't
blink an eye to kill Ned.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.100
I've got to find Ned.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.700
I swear, I swear,
I don't know where he is.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.700
Roy told me

40:12.710 --> 40:14.770
Ned was gonna
call me at Brownie's

40:14.770 --> 40:17.280
today at 2:30.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.540
That's all I know, okay?
That's it.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.480
That's what I told Waxwell.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.180
( sighs )

40:24.180 --> 40:25.580
Ranger Walker...

40:25.590 --> 40:29.620
( weepily ):
Don't let nothing
happen to Ned.

40:29.620 --> 40:32.160
Roy wouldn't have wanted
anything to happen to him

40:32.160 --> 40:35.090
on account of something
Roy might have done.

40:35.090 --> 40:37.160
I'll do my best, Star.

40:41.100 --> 40:44.000
Ten hours and ten pots
of caffeine later, man,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.700
we're still sucking air.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.610
There's no pattern
to those robberies,

40:47.610 --> 40:49.370
except they're all
Southern Star banks.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.880
That's it.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.280
Well, we know
that Waxwell believes

40:52.280 --> 40:54.080
he's close to finding Ned.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.680
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
pulled that stunt yesterday.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.120
It must've been Ned
he was talking to

40:58.120 --> 41:00.920
when we found him
at Brownie's.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.450
Which still leaves us
sucking air again, right?

41:03.460 --> 41:05.020
( sighs )

41:05.020 --> 41:07.160
I don't even know if Ned's
gonna pull another robbery

41:07.160 --> 41:08.290
now that
his brother's dead.

41:08.290 --> 41:09.590
Do you think he would?

41:12.500 --> 41:14.170
Maybe he doesn't have to.

41:16.370 --> 41:17.740
Punch up
that computer of yours,

41:17.740 --> 41:19.240
and see what it says
about the mortgage

41:19.240 --> 41:21.940
on the, uh, Buchanon farm.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.980
I want you to know
I'm holding you responsible

41:23.980 --> 41:26.340
for the pickle chip
I found in this circuit board.

41:26.350 --> 41:27.880
( typing )

41:29.680 --> 41:32.780
Okay. The balloon
payment's 226,580,

41:32.790 --> 41:35.190
so with the last robbery,
they have enough.

41:35.190 --> 41:38.160
( typing )

41:38.860 --> 41:40.890
Hey, baby.

41:40.890 --> 41:42.360
That sucker's
due today.

41:50.870 --> 41:52.700
WOMAN: I like him too.
WOMAN 2: I do too.

41:52.710 --> 41:53.710
( whistle )

41:53.710 --> 41:55.010
WAXWELL:
Hey, Ned boy,

41:55.010 --> 41:57.810
your lady friend
sends...regrets.

41:57.810 --> 41:58.940
Ho!

41:58.950 --> 41:59.940
Kill that idea, hoss,

41:59.950 --> 42:00.950
or I'll kill it for you.

42:00.950 --> 42:02.980
Come on over here.
Come on.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.250
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

42:06.250 --> 42:08.120
Now, in case you're thinking,

42:08.120 --> 42:10.860
"I can run faster
than he can draw,"

42:10.860 --> 42:12.360
you can't.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.090
I'll take that for you,
howdy-do.

42:15.090 --> 42:16.330
Come on.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.800
Now, how'd you like
to test-drive

42:20.800 --> 42:23.070
this fine, black American-built
piece of machinery?

42:23.070 --> 42:25.900
I thought you might.
Hop in.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.940
(<i> ominous theme</i>
<i> swells dramatically</i> )

42:53.530 --> 42:55.100
Drop the gun, Waxwell.
You first.

42:55.100 --> 42:57.100
Don't be stupid.
Where you gonna go, huh?

42:57.100 --> 42:58.840
I'm not going to no Texas
hoosegow!

42:58.840 --> 42:59.870
I'll kill this kid!

42:59.870 --> 43:01.540
Drop them guns!

43:01.540 --> 43:04.410
Drop them, or I'll kill him,
I tell you!

43:08.280 --> 43:09.710
Stand up!

43:12.020 --> 43:13.380
Freeze!

43:13.390 --> 43:14.390
( grunts )

43:15.460 --> 43:17.090
Uh-uh!
Back up!

43:17.090 --> 43:19.590
Walker?
Where is he?

43:19.590 --> 43:21.830
Where's Walker?
( crowd chattering )

43:21.830 --> 43:22.960
Walker?

43:22.960 --> 43:25.760
Where is he?

43:25.770 --> 43:27.100
I'll kill this kid,
I tell you!

43:28.200 --> 43:29.330
( grunts )

43:52.190 --> 43:53.190
All right.

43:54.230 --> 43:55.330
All right.
All right.

43:55.330 --> 43:56.760
Put your hands
behind your back.

44:18.790 --> 44:19.980
How's the guard?

44:19.990 --> 44:22.520
Well, a lot better
than Waxwell, I think.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.820
Can you get up?
Yeah.

44:23.820 --> 44:25.690
( crowd chattering )

44:31.700 --> 44:34.170
Come on.

44:34.170 --> 44:37.370
<i> ♪ Right now ♪</i>

44:37.370 --> 44:38.770
<i> ♪ Everybody loves a good... ♪</i>

44:38.770 --> 44:39.970
He had you.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.010
He had you for a minute

44:41.010 --> 44:42.240
when he had you
in that bear hug.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.540
Not even
for a second.

44:43.540 --> 44:44.780
Not even
for a second?

44:44.780 --> 44:46.240
Not even for a second.
He did.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.810
Your headlights
were dimming.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.250
They were not.
They were too.

44:49.250 --> 44:50.250
Were not.
Were too.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.380
Were not.
Were--

44:51.380 --> 44:52.380
Ranger Walker,

44:52.390 --> 44:53.550
Trivette...

44:53.550 --> 44:55.290
Oh, heh, hi, Star.

44:55.290 --> 44:56.990
Hi, Mr. Buchanon.
How are you?

44:56.990 --> 44:58.960
Fine.
Just mighty fine now.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.390
Thanks to you, ma'am.

45:00.390 --> 45:01.990
Oh, my pleasure.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.030
Ned really wasn't part
of the initial robberies.

45:04.030 --> 45:05.300
The bank
dropped all charges.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.200
He's gonna be
released tomorrow.

45:07.200 --> 45:08.430
Do you know that three--

45:08.430 --> 45:09.670
Count 'em, three.

45:09.670 --> 45:12.570
--of them TV networks called up
to buy his story?

45:12.570 --> 45:15.270
Heh, right there they were
while he's in his cell, and--

45:15.270 --> 45:17.780
And they're fighting
each other to write checks.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.740
It's almost enough
to pay off the mortgage.

45:19.750 --> 45:23.310
That's what Ned's been
hondling with them over.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.480
The most important thing is,

45:24.480 --> 45:26.980
you gotta get
Wesley Snipes to play me.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.320
You know,
Trivette,

45:28.320 --> 45:30.620
you're a lot better-looking
than Wesley Snipes.

45:30.620 --> 45:32.190
A lot better-looking.

45:32.190 --> 45:34.530
You're right.

45:34.530 --> 45:36.060
( laughs )
C.D.: Ladies and gentlemen,

45:36.060 --> 45:38.500
let me have
your attention, please.

45:38.500 --> 45:42.500
For the first time to be
performed in our establishment

45:42.500 --> 45:45.570
and the first time performed
<i> off</i> the reservation,

45:45.570 --> 45:49.140
I give you
Uncle Dice Ray.

45:49.140 --> 45:50.910
Let's hear it for Ray.

45:51.710 --> 45:53.810
All right.

45:53.810 --> 45:56.080
Well, so this Indian
pulls up to a stoplight

45:56.080 --> 45:57.950
driving a big, long,
brand-new Cadillac,

45:57.950 --> 46:00.620
and this Texas billionaire
pulls up right beside him,

46:00.620 --> 46:02.020
driving his big,
long Cadillac.

46:02.020 --> 46:03.120
And he looks over there,

46:03.120 --> 46:05.260
sees that Indian
behind the wheel, and he says,

46:05.260 --> 46:06.790
"Say, chief,

46:06.790 --> 46:09.890
what's an Indian doing driving
a big, long Cadillac like that?"

46:09.900 --> 46:11.190
He says,
"Well, pilgrim,

46:11.200 --> 46:12.530
"Sitting Bull
didn't ride around

46:12.530 --> 46:14.530
on some old plug."

46:14.530 --> 46:16.730
( crowd laughs, applauds )

46:16.740 --> 46:20.000
(<i> slow guitar theme playing</i> )

46:21.240 --> 46:22.640
Oh.

46:30.650 --> 46:33.620
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )
