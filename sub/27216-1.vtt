01:14.657 --> 01:16.226
Somebody help me!

01:17.595 --> 01:19.963
Somebody help me, help me!

01:26.704 --> 01:28.339
Somebody help me!

01:58.603 --> 02:02.806
So, definitely no parents
busting in on us today.

02:02.808 --> 02:04.443
No parents are
busting in on us.

02:05.912 --> 02:08.110
That's what I like to hear.

02:08.113 --> 02:09.547
Tell me more about this

02:09.549 --> 02:11.981
best babysitting job
in the world, then.

02:11.983 --> 02:13.418
Yeah, it was freaky.

02:14.386 --> 02:16.821
She booked me to
do another shift.

02:16.823 --> 02:17.987
Well, that's great.

02:17.989 --> 02:19.191
No, it's not.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.092
It was weird.

02:22.094 --> 02:23.894
Why is it weird?

02:23.896 --> 02:26.632
I mean it was weird,
like it was crazy Mark.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.402
I never saw the kid.

02:30.470 --> 02:32.736
So what
was you babysitting?

02:32.738 --> 02:33.872
I don't even know,

02:33.874 --> 02:36.073
and when I asked her
anything about her,

02:36.075 --> 02:39.244
she was really full on
about the rules of house,

02:39.246 --> 02:40.912
there were monitors everywhere.

02:40.914 --> 02:41.947
Okay, so let me
get this straight,

02:41.949 --> 02:44.582
so there's monitors
in the house,

02:44.584 --> 02:46.018
and you don't see the kid.

02:47.019 --> 02:49.654
Doesn't sound like a
babysitting job to me.

02:49.656 --> 02:52.858
I just heard it through
the monitors, I never saw it.

02:52.860 --> 02:53.760
Heard what?

02:54.695 --> 02:56.293
I don't know, the kid.

02:56.295 --> 02:58.098
Put the
kid through what?

02:59.099 --> 03:01.533
Just making
noises, I don't know,

03:01.535 --> 03:03.870
that's what I mean, it
was weird, it's not funny,

03:03.872 --> 03:05.103
it was kinda creepy.

03:05.105 --> 03:08.640
Did it sound like a
old man heavy breathing?

03:08.642 --> 03:09.777
Like ah, yes.

03:10.912 --> 03:12.678
I'm not sure, actually.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.181
Oh dear, how do you
get yourself in these

03:15.183 --> 03:17.950
ridiculous
situations, seriously?

03:17.952 --> 03:19.654
How have you even
survived this long?

03:20.855 --> 03:23.691
That is a very good
question, I don't know.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.994
Don't make me go
back there, please.

03:28.831 --> 03:31.330
I thought you said your parents
weren't coming back today.

03:33.469 --> 03:35.869
They aren't, it's probably
a neighbor, stay here.

03:35.871 --> 03:37.603
Come on, last time your dad
caught us in shit like this.

03:37.605 --> 03:39.072
Calm down.

03:39.074 --> 03:40.106
I thought he
was gonna kill me.

03:40.108 --> 03:42.110
Calm yourself, lie down.

03:43.044 --> 03:45.180
God, every time.

04:01.897 --> 04:03.233
What the hell?

04:06.970 --> 04:07.804
Hello!

04:32.063 --> 04:34.630
Can you grab me a
bottle of wine, please?

04:34.632 --> 04:37.702
Not the expensive stuff,
just get the cheap stuff.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.660
- What's this?
- Oh my.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.063
That is not funny.

05:07.065 --> 05:08.163
Well, I thought
it was hilarious.

05:08.165 --> 05:09.568
Someone left this.

05:10.636 --> 05:11.536
Creepy fucker.

05:12.804 --> 05:16.172
You know, that literally
looks like you as a doll.

05:16.174 --> 05:18.808
How funny.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.043
I hate you.

05:20.045 --> 05:21.244
Look, he's even
got, you got a bit,

05:21.246 --> 05:23.181
a bit of a scar there on you?

05:24.516 --> 05:26.149
Okay, I'll stop.

05:26.151 --> 05:29.254
Have you heard of the
Legend of Mandy the Doll?

05:30.957 --> 05:32.591
Mandy the Doll?

05:34.027 --> 05:37.460
Oh, isn't that
about that girl who,

05:37.462 --> 05:39.530
she got left in a
church or something,

05:39.532 --> 05:41.532
and some bullies killed
her, is that right?

05:41.534 --> 05:44.135
No, she wasn't
killed by the bullies.

05:44.137 --> 05:46.604
She was left there,
and she froze to death,

05:46.606 --> 05:48.539
and her soul went into the doll

05:48.541 --> 05:50.942
that she was clutching
onto, have you heard of it?

05:50.944 --> 05:52.345
- The doll?
- Yeah.

05:56.984 --> 05:58.684
Come on.

05:58.686 --> 06:00.619
What, and you think
this is the same doll?

06:00.621 --> 06:01.687
Yeah.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.122
How do you know
it's the same one?

06:03.124 --> 06:06.024
Look at this, it's
exactly the same part,

06:06.026 --> 06:07.528
there, look at that.

06:08.528 --> 06:10.431
Okay, so when was
the doll last seen?

06:12.100 --> 06:14.132
Like, 10 years
ago, a pregnant lady

06:14.134 --> 06:15.804
at a car boot sale bought it.

06:18.672 --> 06:19.873
It's been 10 years.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.143
I'm really freaking out

06:24.145 --> 06:27.081
because the lady that
I was babysitting for,

06:27.083 --> 06:29.048
she had loads of dolls.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.516
Heaps of them.

06:30.518 --> 06:31.751
Some people have dolls.

06:31.753 --> 06:34.121
Yeah, but she cracked
it at me when I left,

06:34.123 --> 06:35.890
so what if she sent me this?

06:37.324 --> 06:40.293
Look, you're just letting
your imagination run wild, okay?

06:40.295 --> 06:42.595
It's just the guys
trying to fuck with us.

06:42.597 --> 06:44.697
It's not, think about
it, it makes sense,

06:44.699 --> 06:49.268
she had creepy dolls in the
house, I never saw the kid,

06:49.270 --> 06:51.572
she cracked it when I left,

06:51.574 --> 06:54.208
and now this turns
up on our doorstep.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.576
Oh my god, I'm telling
you this is literally

06:56.578 --> 06:58.881
just a practical joke, okay?

06:59.582 --> 07:02.216
Just chill out, like come on.

07:02.218 --> 07:04.453
Oh yeah, it looks
like mad, don't it?

07:05.421 --> 07:07.790
Ooh scary, it's
just a doll, okay?

07:21.538 --> 07:23.840
You're being ridiculous.

07:25.341 --> 07:26.844
Stop being ridiculous.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.711
I said to stop calling me.

08:04.415 --> 08:07.349
Look, I don't want to
babysit for you anymore.

08:07.351 --> 08:08.952
Stop calling me.

08:08.954 --> 08:11.455
If you don't stop, then
I'll call the police.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.114
Mark?

08:36.481 --> 08:38.517
Mark, what's going on?

08:44.757 --> 08:45.592
Soph?

09:05.246 --> 09:10.384
What are you doing?

09:11.285 --> 09:13.185
You wanna get
steamy, do ya babe?

09:13.187 --> 09:14.454
Mark!

09:48.957 --> 09:49.724
Mark?

09:55.398 --> 09:56.329
Mark,

09:56.331 --> 09:57.465
what's going on?

10:07.343 --> 10:09.210
Mark, this isn't funny.

10:09.212 --> 10:10.811
If you're trying
to freak me out,

10:10.813 --> 10:13.749
you can seriously stay
somewhere else this weekend.

10:29.032 --> 10:29.866
Mark?

10:52.857 --> 10:53.657
Mark?

11:12.510 --> 11:13.544
Oh my god!

11:37.403 --> 11:39.203
Play with me.

14:02.152 --> 14:03.752
Oh, you didn't think
we'd forget you, did you?

14:03.754 --> 14:05.621
I didn't think
you were gonna show.

14:05.623 --> 14:07.824
Oh, I'm sorry we're late.

14:34.186 --> 14:35.020
Fuck.

14:36.955 --> 14:38.358
Oh, this tastes amazing!

14:39.758 --> 14:41.160
Holy shit.

14:42.528 --> 14:44.863
Been a while, huh?

14:46.732 --> 14:48.532
Do we have any more?

14:48.534 --> 14:51.202
I'll fix you something when
we get back to the hideout.

14:51.204 --> 14:51.971
Hideout?

14:53.340 --> 14:55.739
It's complicated, I
mean it's not been easy

14:55.741 --> 14:56.776
prepping for today.

14:57.743 --> 14:59.878
How long have you
guys been back together?

15:00.946 --> 15:02.914
Don't be like that, I mean,

15:02.916 --> 15:04.782
he still likes to
drink, he's got clean,

15:04.784 --> 15:06.484
we're getting there.

15:06.486 --> 15:08.320
I just care about you.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.421
It won't be like before.

15:09.423 --> 15:12.926
I don't want things to go
back to the way the were.

15:14.094 --> 15:16.695
I want this to be a
start of a new life.

15:16.697 --> 15:17.998
Everything's changed.

15:19.132 --> 15:19.966
Okay.

15:26.307 --> 15:27.441
What's that face for?

15:28.509 --> 15:29.776
What are you thinking?

15:30.478 --> 15:32.612
Look, to get that new start

15:32.614 --> 15:34.448
we just need to do
something first.

15:47.562 --> 15:48.396
Take this.

15:49.765 --> 15:50.798
Here we are.

15:51.767 --> 15:52.800
Let's go.

15:55.437 --> 15:58.038
I got out hours ago,
and you wanna set me up

15:58.040 --> 16:00.640
on a job that could send
me straight back in?

16:00.642 --> 16:02.578
Look, just come on.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.629
Amber come
on, it's not a hard job.

16:21.631 --> 16:22.797
You know what I mean?

16:22.799 --> 16:24.498
Carly's done it before.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.733
I swear, you go in there

16:25.735 --> 16:27.769
and you don't even
have to do anything.

16:27.771 --> 16:28.936
Amber,

16:28.938 --> 16:31.004
listen to me very carefully.

16:31.006 --> 16:33.207
We set you up for
a babysitting job,

16:33.209 --> 16:35.943
go up in there, like
you're little miss perfect,

16:35.945 --> 16:38.747
soon as the house is
free, you call us.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.549
We do the work.

16:40.551 --> 16:42.049
Fuck sake, Amber.

16:42.051 --> 16:44.686
Think about it, it's not
like you gotta do shit.

16:44.688 --> 16:45.986
What about the kid?

16:45.988 --> 16:46.921
You just call the parents,

16:46.923 --> 16:48.055
you tell them something came up,

16:48.057 --> 16:49.791
and then you get out of there.

16:49.793 --> 16:50.961
It's nothing.

16:52.730 --> 16:56.130
Oh hey, we stole
all your belongings,

16:56.132 --> 16:58.266
kid's fine, catch ya later?

16:58.268 --> 16:59.901
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
something like that.

16:59.903 --> 17:01.136
Fuck you!

17:01.138 --> 17:04.875
Seriously, can you
just give us a minute?

17:09.414 --> 17:10.847
Amber.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.615
Fresh start, new beginnings,
I should have known

17:12.617 --> 17:14.148
that you were full of shit.

17:14.151 --> 17:15.916
Look, this is gonna
be a new start for us,

17:15.919 --> 17:17.119
for all three of us.

17:17.122 --> 17:18.421
Look, when we found
out you were coming out

17:18.423 --> 17:20.423
we gave up everything
to start again.

17:20.425 --> 17:22.090
We've paid off all the
dealers, the lenders,

17:22.093 --> 17:24.861
I mean, Neil has
even sold his PMR30.

17:24.863 --> 17:26.463
So?

17:26.464 --> 17:27.765
What are you saying?

17:27.767 --> 17:30.133
- Boo hoo, Neil sold his gun.
- I'm saying.

17:30.135 --> 17:32.369
- I went to jail!
- I'm saying we're broke.

17:32.371 --> 17:34.505
Yeah you went to jail,
none of us wanted that.

17:34.507 --> 17:37.275
I wished every day that
things had ended differently.

17:38.444 --> 17:40.811
But look, you're out
now, you're in the clear,

17:40.813 --> 17:42.046
everything's paid off.

17:43.649 --> 17:47.251
Come on, you just do this
one final job for fast,

17:47.253 --> 17:50.189
unmarked cash then we can go
wherever the hell you want.

17:51.924 --> 17:52.958
Come on.

17:57.764 --> 17:59.932
What's the worst
that could happen, huh?

18:02.502 --> 18:03.902
Look, I'm not
gonna sugar coat it,

18:03.904 --> 18:05.470
we rob some rich fucking family,

18:05.472 --> 18:08.840
and then Neil's contact comes
in and buys it all off us.

18:08.842 --> 18:10.575
We get unmarked cash, Amber.

18:10.577 --> 18:15.280
We get 50% dollars, 50% Euros,
we get three new passports.

18:15.282 --> 18:16.614
We can go wherever we want.

18:16.616 --> 18:20.586
You always wanted to go to
Italy, we could go there.

18:20.588 --> 18:22.456
Come on, you need this.

18:25.325 --> 18:26.859
Fine.

18:51.118 --> 18:53.854
It's time for us to
take control of our lives,

18:53.856 --> 18:55.054
can't change our past,

18:55.056 --> 18:56.758
but we can change our future.

18:57.926 --> 19:00.993
I want to give you
the life you deserve.

19:00.995 --> 19:03.065
The life Mom
should've given you.

19:06.033 --> 19:07.068
You know

19:08.504 --> 19:10.604
I don't blame you

19:10.606 --> 19:12.541
for anything that happened.

19:13.241 --> 19:15.110
None of it was your fault.

19:16.512 --> 19:18.912
Whoever our mom was,

19:18.914 --> 19:21.183
she wasn't a mother to me.

19:22.685 --> 19:24.417
You were.

19:24.419 --> 19:28.424
You made me the
person I am today.

19:29.659 --> 19:30.760
You're right,

19:32.897 --> 19:36.131
maybe it is time we take control

19:38.033 --> 19:39.068
back.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.147
Yo, yo, yo!

19:53.149 --> 19:56.184
Rise and shine,
we have a target.

19:56.186 --> 19:57.421
Time to suit up.

19:59.857 --> 20:01.522
Alright so check it out,

20:01.524 --> 20:02.393
some lady,

20:03.561 --> 20:05.694
single parent I think,

20:05.696 --> 20:07.863
nice sized house,

20:07.865 --> 20:09.768
wants you to look after her kid.

20:11.302 --> 20:12.169
Anyways,

20:13.637 --> 20:15.404
it is

20:15.406 --> 20:16.538
perfect.

20:16.540 --> 20:19.775
Quiet, little dusty
here and there,

20:19.777 --> 20:21.210
bit of clutter,

20:21.212 --> 20:22.547
but trust me,

20:23.915 --> 20:25.416
hell of a lot of shit to sell.

20:26.851 --> 20:27.652
This is for you,

20:28.653 --> 20:31.054
it's got enough credit
to last you tonight,

20:31.056 --> 20:33.124
remember to dash away
the phones after.

20:34.593 --> 20:35.393
Amber,

20:36.628 --> 20:38.896
don't be trying to hold onto
this shit after tonight.

20:38.898 --> 20:42.167
I can't have him having any way
of tracking this back to us.

20:44.303 --> 20:47.938
Make sure you call us an
hour after she leaves,

20:47.940 --> 20:49.474
and we're done by midnight.

20:51.711 --> 20:54.210
The fuck, am I talking
to myself here?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.180
She heard you.

20:56.782 --> 20:57.583
Is that right?

20:58.951 --> 21:00.417
I heard you.

21:00.419 --> 21:01.152
Good.

21:02.355 --> 21:03.155
Oh,

21:05.058 --> 21:06.459
your profile says Jessie.

21:08.194 --> 21:09.761
So I'd use that name
unless you wanna risk

21:09.763 --> 21:11.263
getting thrown back inside.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.701
Alright, it's about that time.

21:16.903 --> 21:17.904
Let's do this.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.026
All right, so her name's
Dorothy O'Brien, okay?

21:40.028 --> 21:42.727
She lives alone, and
she's got one child.

21:42.729 --> 21:46.197
What kind of stuff do
you want me to look for?

21:46.199 --> 21:49.035
All right, you just
leave that to us.

21:49.037 --> 21:50.403
You just go in there,

21:50.405 --> 21:53.105
and well do the rest.

21:53.107 --> 21:54.339
You ready?

21:54.341 --> 21:57.276
Let's get this over with.

21:57.278 --> 21:58.210
Let's go!

22:25.741 --> 22:26.874
Ms. O'Brien?

22:26.876 --> 22:28.243
It's Jessie, the sitter.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.454
Hello?

23:23.601 --> 23:24.435
Hello.

23:25.469 --> 23:27.304
You must be Jessie.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.506
I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have just

23:30.508 --> 23:32.444
walked into your
house like that.

23:33.879 --> 23:37.446
I'm assuming it was
you who let me in.

23:37.448 --> 23:39.382
Oh, that will be Mandy.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.051
Just after I've
settled her to sleep.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.352
You go in the dining room,

23:43.354 --> 23:46.689
and I'll go up and check on
Mandy, I'll be right back.

23:46.691 --> 23:47.459
Okay.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.650
That's
it Mandy, that's it.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.386
Look, I should be
back soon, okay?

24:15.388 --> 24:17.321
I should be back soon,

24:17.323 --> 24:18.858
a nice young girl is downstairs.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.260
I know, I know.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.395
Shush, shush,

24:24.397 --> 24:26.164
it's fine Mandy.

24:26.166 --> 24:29.366
All is going to be just fine.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.437
That's it, sleep tight.

24:50.124 --> 24:54.293
I've put together a little
list for you, house rules,

24:54.295 --> 24:57.432
so we can get the
best of Mandy's moods.

24:58.700 --> 25:02.302
The attic is
completely off limits,

25:02.304 --> 25:04.105
that's Mandy's play area.

25:05.673 --> 25:09.109
She absolutely hates
being left alone,

25:09.111 --> 25:12.612
so you're not to leave the
house under any circumstances,

25:12.614 --> 25:14.214
you don't go in the garden,

25:14.216 --> 25:15.715
- you don't answer the door,
- Of course.

25:15.717 --> 25:18.218
you don't have a cigarette.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.051
Of course,

25:19.053 --> 25:20.055
I won't.

25:21.257 --> 25:24.291
You see, Mandy
tends to cry a lot,

25:24.293 --> 25:26.327
and if Mandy is to waken,

25:26.329 --> 25:29.395
there's no getting
her back to sleep.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.731
I've provided a monitor for you,

25:31.733 --> 25:35.702
so you can hear everything
that's happening in the room.

25:35.704 --> 25:39.773
I've also provided
this visual monitor,

25:39.775 --> 25:43.443
which registers any
movement in the room.

25:43.445 --> 25:45.380
After all, we don't
want Mandy out of bed

25:45.382 --> 25:47.148
running around, do we?

25:47.150 --> 25:49.451
Or anyone else in the room.

25:50.720 --> 25:54.122
She tends to sleep
quite well at night,

25:54.124 --> 25:56.557
and as I've managed to
get her off to sleep,

25:56.559 --> 25:59.327
she should be fine
for the night.

25:59.329 --> 26:01.262
If there is any problem,

26:01.264 --> 26:04.732
you are to call me immediately.

26:04.734 --> 26:08.103
You see, if Mandy were
to wake, she is to cry.

26:08.105 --> 26:11.808
If she is to cry, I shall
have to return home.

26:13.043 --> 26:17.079
There is no stopping her
once Mandy starts to cry,

26:17.081 --> 26:18.247
do you understand?

26:18.249 --> 26:20.482
Sure, I got it.

26:20.484 --> 26:23.252
Don't go in her room,
and if she's to wake

26:23.254 --> 26:25.720
or cry, to give you call.

26:25.722 --> 26:30.125
You make it sound so much
simpler than it truly is.

26:31.362 --> 26:32.728
She's just a kid, right?

26:32.730 --> 26:34.632
She is a special girl.

26:35.566 --> 26:37.466
Anyway, must go.

26:37.468 --> 26:39.603
Tonight, where are you going?

26:40.571 --> 26:41.806
A gathering.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.376
I shouldn't be home much after
midnight, I shouldn't think.

26:46.378 --> 26:47.478
Time to go.

26:56.189 --> 26:59.656
Just checking, Mandy, she
does know I'm here right?

26:59.658 --> 27:02.159
Of course she knows.

27:02.161 --> 27:04.362
She knows all about you Jessie.

27:04.364 --> 27:05.630
How old is she?

27:06.898 --> 27:09.400
I thought it was rather
rude to ask a woman's age.

27:09.402 --> 27:12.169
Oh, right.

27:12.171 --> 27:15.474
You have my number on
the information sheet,

27:15.476 --> 27:18.808
I shall have my phone
by my side all evening.

27:18.810 --> 27:22.913
Don't hesitate to
call, if necessary.

27:22.915 --> 27:24.415
Of course.

27:24.417 --> 27:26.318
Have a nice nice, Ms. O'Brien.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.154
See you soon.

27:36.062 --> 27:36.896
Okay.

28:21.410 --> 28:26.614
Shh.

28:29.485 --> 28:30.517
Don't go in the
attic, remember,

28:30.519 --> 28:32.688
don't go in the attic.

32:55.159 --> 32:58.229
Come up
and play with me.

34:24.552 --> 34:25.554
Oh my god.

34:26.388 --> 34:27.222
Oh my god.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.958
Oh my god, oh my god.

34:50.813 --> 34:52.011
Hey babe, what'd I tell you

34:52.013 --> 34:54.347
about trying to put your
fucking toes up my ass.

34:54.349 --> 34:55.750
What?

34:55.752 --> 34:57.818
What are you talking about?

34:57.820 --> 34:58.819
What?

34:58.821 --> 35:00.556
Fuck off, I didn't say shit.

35:04.293 --> 35:06.028
Why is fucking Amber ringing us?

35:07.931 --> 35:09.731
Amber?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.501
The child, the child's gone.

35:12.268 --> 35:14.870
Someone's been in the house.

35:14.872 --> 35:16.370
Carly,

35:16.372 --> 35:17.171
fuck!

35:17.173 --> 35:18.105
Amber, calm down, calm down,

35:18.107 --> 35:19.576
what do you mean she's gone?

35:20.744 --> 35:24.178
I heard a voice, a lady's
voice on the monitor,

35:24.180 --> 35:26.548
someone must've sneaked
in when I was asleep,

35:26.550 --> 35:27.749
and taken her.

35:27.751 --> 35:31.854
Carly, fuck, I'm gonna have
to call Ms. O'Brien, Carly,

35:31.856 --> 35:33.054
fuck!

35:33.056 --> 35:33.990
Okay right away,
call her straight away,

35:33.992 --> 35:35.690
we'll be there in 20 minutes.

35:35.692 --> 35:37.024
What the fuck's going on?

35:37.026 --> 35:39.495
Please go, go, go, go.

35:46.337 --> 35:47.503
Come on.

35:47.505 --> 35:52.443
Come on, come on.

35:53.645 --> 35:55.210
Hi Jessie,
how's it going there?

35:55.212 --> 35:58.748
Ms. O'Brien,

35:58.750 --> 36:00.750
I think you need to come home.

36:00.752 --> 36:02.920
- What's happened?
- Oh my god.

36:04.757 --> 36:06.023
It's Mandy,

36:06.025 --> 36:08.892
I think that someone
must have taken her.

36:08.894 --> 36:11.728
I'm so, so sorry Ms. O'Brien.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.797
What do
you mean Mandy is gone?

36:13.799 --> 36:15.132
She can't have just gone.

36:15.134 --> 36:17.601
Haven't you checked the house?

36:17.603 --> 36:18.936
Yeah!

36:18.938 --> 36:20.571
Yeah, she's not in her bed.

36:20.573 --> 36:23.040
All that's in her
bed is just this,

36:23.042 --> 36:24.173
just this doll.

36:24.175 --> 36:26.076
Mandy
should be in the bed.

36:26.078 --> 36:28.312
She has strawberry blonde hair,

36:28.314 --> 36:29.947
and a pretty white dress.

36:29.949 --> 36:31.685
She should be in the bed.

36:32.919 --> 36:35.820
Are you sure she
isn't in bed, Jess?

36:38.992 --> 36:41.795
Strawberry blonde hair.

36:42.661 --> 36:44.364
White dress.

36:46.499 --> 36:48.098
She's the girl in
the photo with you

36:48.100 --> 36:49.369
by the side of her bed?

36:50.303 --> 36:53.137
Mandy,
yes, that's her,

36:53.139 --> 36:54.207
that's my Mandy.

36:56.611 --> 36:57.645
Yes!

36:59.080 --> 37:00.113
Yes.

37:00.947 --> 37:03.214
Ms. O'Brien, I see the photo,

37:03.216 --> 37:05.017
I see Mandy.

37:05.019 --> 37:08.189
She's in the bed,
and she's sleeping.

37:09.122 --> 37:11.991
I'm so sorry, Ms. O'Brien,

37:11.993 --> 37:14.159
I messed up, have a great night.

37:14.161 --> 37:16.362
Call
me if you need me,

37:16.364 --> 37:20.100
and try not to scare me
half to death again, please.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.014
Come on!

38:38.016 --> 38:39.349
It's fine, it's fine.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.385
The child,

38:42.251 --> 38:43.320
it's not a child.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.366
Oh my god, this is creepy.

38:57.368 --> 39:00.069
Check out the photo.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.173
The fuck is this?

39:03.175 --> 39:05.174
You taking the piss?

39:05.176 --> 39:06.441
This crazy bitch
ain't gonna realize

39:06.443 --> 39:08.246
none of her shit's missing.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.246
This is perfect!

39:10.248 --> 39:11.280
I mean, this is
something else.

39:11.282 --> 39:12.648
Something else?

39:12.650 --> 39:15.284
Babe, this is
fucking incredible.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.488
Let's do this, honestly.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.290
Come on, we never had
it this perfect before.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.961
Let's just get what we
need and get out of here.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.863
Yeah, yeah, we gotta
wait for Diane though.

39:25.865 --> 39:26.830
Diane?

39:26.832 --> 39:28.232
Oh, she's the contact
from the network,

39:28.234 --> 39:29.265
she's the one who's
gonna buy all this shit.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.870
Are you serious?

39:31.938 --> 39:33.303
What time is she coming?

39:33.305 --> 39:35.205
Ms. O'Brien said she was
gonna be back my midnight,

39:35.207 --> 39:37.341
it's already like nine!

39:37.343 --> 39:38.542
Alright, chill with
that shit, alright?

39:38.544 --> 39:40.310
She'll be here
before then, okay?

39:40.312 --> 39:41.714
She's gonna keep me updated.

39:43.015 --> 39:46.851
Let us go and investigate
the shit out of this place.

39:46.853 --> 39:47.620
Come on.

40:11.311 --> 40:13.347
I'm gonna be so loaded.

40:16.284 --> 40:18.650
Never thought she'd have
this much shit, you know?

40:18.652 --> 40:21.654
Label that as high priority.

40:21.656 --> 40:23.323
I'm gonna go get a drink.

40:28.197 --> 40:29.329
Did you guys hear that?

40:34.735 --> 40:35.570
How do I look?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.574
Fucking hot.

41:00.394 --> 41:03.132
Too much time inside,
I'm going crazy.

41:40.271 --> 41:42.403
Why did you leave me?

41:58.956 --> 41:59.757
Hello?

42:03.295 --> 42:05.063
I don't
like being alone.

42:07.098 --> 42:07.999
Who is that?

42:08.700 --> 42:10.400
I wanna play a game.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.335
Will you play with me?

42:12.337 --> 42:13.505
Who is that?

42:15.274 --> 42:17.709
You know who it is.

42:21.347 --> 42:22.181
Hello?

42:24.115 --> 42:24.950
Mandy?

42:35.361 --> 42:38.229
Take this shit
downstairs for Diane.

42:38.231 --> 42:39.799
I'm gonna go check
out the attic.

43:03.256 --> 43:04.825
Fucking shit blood.

44:10.993 --> 44:12.327
Are you there?

44:17.966 --> 44:19.333
Are you guys
all right down there?

44:19.335 --> 44:21.202
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

44:21.204 --> 44:22.303
Seriously?

44:22.305 --> 44:24.372
Why are you freaking out,
this couldn't be any easier,

44:24.374 --> 44:25.975
we're gonna be fine.

44:32.450 --> 44:33.848
Cool, cool, cool.

44:33.850 --> 44:36.583
Fucking joke, this man.

44:36.585 --> 44:38.454
Fuck me!

44:43.626 --> 44:45.294
Alright, alright, cool.

44:45.296 --> 44:46.596
Dickhead doll.

44:51.702 --> 44:53.770
Can you take this?

44:58.275 --> 44:59.508
What is it?

44:59.510 --> 45:01.444
We're not alone.

45:14.526 --> 45:17.095
Fuck it man, I'm
taking this shit.

45:23.667 --> 45:26.570
What do you mean
we're not alone?

45:26.572 --> 45:27.339
I heard.

45:29.574 --> 45:32.642
What are you talking about?

45:32.644 --> 45:33.412
Mandy.

45:34.447 --> 45:36.148
She's alive.

45:46.626 --> 45:48.658
What do you mean
Mandy's alive?

45:48.660 --> 45:49.660
I heard her.

45:49.662 --> 45:50.694
I heard her earlier.

45:50.696 --> 45:53.197
I spoke to her, just now.

45:53.199 --> 45:54.398
Stop freaking out.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.568
The first time I did this,
I was freaking out too,

45:56.570 --> 45:58.269
but can't you see how
silly you're being?

45:58.271 --> 45:59.303
Where's Neil?

45:59.305 --> 46:00.371
He's upstairs in the attic.

46:00.373 --> 46:01.306
Neil!

46:01.308 --> 46:02.240
Seriously Amber, what the hell

46:02.242 --> 46:02.973
- is going on?
- Neil!

46:02.975 --> 46:04.108
Amber, what the hell's going on?

46:04.110 --> 46:06.880
You wouldn't
believe if I told you!

46:19.059 --> 46:20.626
What the fuck?

46:20.628 --> 46:22.394
Stop fucking around!

46:22.396 --> 46:23.696
What the fuck is this shit?

46:24.565 --> 46:25.400
Hello!

46:34.875 --> 46:36.708
- Neil?
- Carly!

46:36.710 --> 46:38.744
Carly, please don't go up there.

46:38.746 --> 46:40.946
What the hell is going on?

46:40.948 --> 46:43.749
The doll, it's alive.

46:43.751 --> 46:44.817
How much did
you have to drink?

46:44.819 --> 46:46.052
Carly, please.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.620
Seriously, go wait
for me downstairs.

46:47.622 --> 46:49.590
- No!
- I said go.

46:49.592 --> 46:50.359
No.

46:51.627 --> 46:52.626
Carly!

46:58.900 --> 47:00.335
That's blood.

47:09.744 --> 47:12.479
Carly: Oh my god.

47:42.713 --> 47:43.547
Neil?

47:51.788 --> 47:52.822
Neil?

48:00.398 --> 48:01.198
Neil?

48:15.279 --> 48:17.880
Neil, it's Diane,
I've got the cash!

48:17.882 --> 48:19.884
What you got for me?

48:58.624 --> 48:59.956
There's someone down there,

48:59.958 --> 49:02.460
do you think it's
Neil or the contact?

49:02.462 --> 49:03.229
Or.

49:04.230 --> 49:07.267
It's fucking Mandy
waiting for us.

49:30.792 --> 49:32.059
It's Diane.

49:32.861 --> 49:34.526
Hello?

49:34.528 --> 49:35.295
Where's Neil?

49:36.296 --> 49:37.896
I'm supposed to be
meeting him here.

49:37.898 --> 49:39.231
Yeah, it's Carly,
his girlfriend,

49:39.233 --> 49:40.800
we think we're in the house.

49:40.802 --> 49:43.169
I'm the house, where are you?

49:43.171 --> 49:46.839
We're
upstairs, where are you?

49:46.841 --> 49:47.673
Got ya.

49:47.675 --> 49:49.877
In kid's room, right?

49:49.879 --> 49:51.177
How did you know that?

49:51.179 --> 49:53.146
Yeah, I can see you
on the baby monitor.

49:53.148 --> 49:54.882
Who's there with you?

49:54.884 --> 49:56.215
My sister.

49:56.217 --> 49:57.617
Alright, well where's Neil?

49:57.619 --> 50:00.020
Is he the third person there?

50:09.899 --> 50:12.198
Carly, what is it?

50:12.200 --> 50:14.835
There's someone in the room.

50:18.239 --> 50:20.842
Oh my god!

50:20.844 --> 50:23.076
What the hell is that?

50:23.078 --> 50:24.513
It's the doll,

50:26.449 --> 50:27.349
she's real.

50:29.785 --> 50:31.952
I wanna play a game,

50:31.954 --> 50:34.123
will you play with me?

50:36.459 --> 50:37.260
Mandy?

50:38.028 --> 50:41.295
I'll give you a clue.

50:59.516 --> 51:02.520
What the bloody
hell is going on?

51:39.024 --> 51:41.123
Right, I'm not one for games!

51:41.125 --> 51:43.428
If its children
I'm dealing with,

51:44.898 --> 51:46.765
I should just take
my money elsewhere!

51:47.966 --> 51:49.834
Peek-a-boo.

51:55.842 --> 51:56.643
Diane?

51:57.577 --> 51:58.843
Diane!

51:58.845 --> 52:00.176
We need to get out of here.

52:00.178 --> 52:02.380
Wait here, I need
to get the cash.

52:02.382 --> 52:03.414
Carly, no.

52:03.416 --> 52:05.315
I got us into this
mess, wait here.

52:05.317 --> 52:06.084
Carly!

52:07.988 --> 52:09.186
Carly.

52:09.188 --> 52:11.054
- Don't go.
- No I'll be fine.

52:11.056 --> 52:12.157
Go upstairs.

52:21.735 --> 52:22.702
She's not here.

52:38.954 --> 52:40.385
Shit.

52:40.387 --> 52:43.957
Shit, shit, Amber,
Amber I've got the cash!

52:43.959 --> 52:45.392
I've got the cash!

52:48.897 --> 52:50.799
It is mine.

52:51.900 --> 52:54.199
Oh my god, what
the fuck is this?

52:54.201 --> 52:56.002
What the fuck?

52:56.004 --> 52:57.137
Oh my god.

53:02.911 --> 53:04.644
Hello?

53:04.646 --> 53:05.413
Mandy?

53:07.549 --> 53:09.148
Oh my god.

53:09.150 --> 53:14.054
Why does everyone
try and run from me?

53:25.434 --> 53:26.268
Carly?

53:27.770 --> 53:29.304
What's going on?

53:40.816 --> 53:41.584
Carly?

53:44.021 --> 53:45.221
Is that you?

53:48.659 --> 53:50.260
One step.

53:51.028 --> 53:52.261
Two step.

53:54.131 --> 53:55.265
Three step.

53:57.501 --> 53:58.301
Four step.

54:00.202 --> 54:01.204
Five step.

54:04.975 --> 54:06.544
I'm coming for you.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.210
I want to play.

54:09.212 --> 54:12.448
I wanna play with you, sitter.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.217
Six.

54:15.053 --> 54:16.286
Seven.

54:18.188 --> 54:20.389
- Eight step.
- Please!

54:20.391 --> 54:21.757
Come on, come on.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.360
Nine step.

54:29.167 --> 54:30.801
Fuck.

54:30.803 --> 54:31.569
No.

54:33.138 --> 54:35.204
Ready or not,

54:35.206 --> 54:36.973
here I come.

54:51.056 --> 54:52.856
Peek-a-boo.

55:43.211 --> 55:45.279
Oh my god, no, no!

55:50.051 --> 55:52.218
Carly, Carly, Carly!

55:52.220 --> 55:54.288
Thank god you're alive!

55:55.891 --> 55:56.892
Oh my god.

55:57.959 --> 55:58.957
Oh my god.

55:58.959 --> 56:00.560
What the fuck is this!

56:00.562 --> 56:03.229
My tea party.

56:03.231 --> 56:05.198
Sorry if I made you jump.

56:07.170 --> 56:08.868
What do you want from us?

56:08.870 --> 56:10.302
Please.

56:10.304 --> 56:12.505
I want you
to be my friends,

56:12.507 --> 56:15.377
and I want you to have
fun at my tea party.

56:18.213 --> 56:19.514
No.

56:20.482 --> 56:22.183
Your friends
were scared of me,

56:22.185 --> 56:24.317
I had to silence them.

56:24.319 --> 56:27.221
I don't like the
noises they make.

56:29.624 --> 56:32.626
Why is everyone so
frightened of me?

56:32.628 --> 56:35.296
No one ever wants
to be my friend.

56:35.298 --> 56:37.299
I wanna be your friend.

56:37.301 --> 56:38.933
You do?

56:38.935 --> 56:41.202
That's why I took this job.

56:41.204 --> 56:42.738
Then why did you lie?

56:49.880 --> 56:51.313
I didn't lie.

56:51.315 --> 56:54.382
You said
your name was Jessie.

56:54.384 --> 56:56.753
You are a naughty babysitter.

56:57.620 --> 56:58.920
I lied,

56:58.922 --> 57:01.990
because I didn't wanna

57:01.992 --> 57:04.326
scare you from what I've done

57:04.328 --> 57:05.561
in my past.

57:06.530 --> 57:09.867
I'm not
scared of you, Amber.

57:10.868 --> 57:13.437
Now you're going to
be my friends forever.

57:16.274 --> 57:18.173
What even are you!

57:18.175 --> 57:19.942
Well, I am a girl.

57:19.944 --> 57:21.445
You're a doll!

57:26.150 --> 57:27.652
Where did she go?

57:31.756 --> 57:33.823
We're sorry Mandy,
we didn't mean it.

57:33.825 --> 57:37.894
We didn't mean it, we
know you're not a doll.

57:37.896 --> 57:39.962
We know that you're
a little girl,

57:39.964 --> 57:42.266
we know that, we know

57:42.268 --> 57:43.468
we know that.

57:44.336 --> 57:46.469
Time to play a game.

57:46.471 --> 57:49.606
Okay, what game
do you wanna play?

57:49.608 --> 57:51.275
Hide and seek.

57:51.277 --> 57:53.444
Where am I, can you see me?

57:54.281 --> 57:56.346
I can see you.

58:03.989 --> 58:05.454
Oh my god, she cut me!

58:05.456 --> 58:06.592
No, Carly!

58:10.996 --> 58:13.398
You're going
to find me, silly.

58:22.808 --> 58:23.642
What?

58:24.811 --> 58:25.645
Shit!

58:29.983 --> 58:30.985
Bloody hell.

58:32.686 --> 58:34.619
Ms. O'Brien!

58:34.621 --> 58:37.555
- We're up here!
- We're upstairs!

58:37.557 --> 58:38.692
Ms. O'Brien!

58:40.394 --> 58:42.594
We're up here!

58:42.596 --> 58:44.063
Ms. O'Brien!

58:44.065 --> 58:47.999
- Ms. O'Brien, please!
- Please, please, please!

58:48.001 --> 58:49.470
We're up here!

58:50.404 --> 58:51.906
Please, Ms. O'Brien!

58:53.506 --> 58:56.477
Oh my god Mandy,
what have you done!

58:57.845 --> 58:59.546
I'm so sorry.

59:00.548 --> 59:02.082
I told you,

59:02.084 --> 59:06.485
I told you to call me
if she were to wake.

59:06.487 --> 59:09.822
Oh Mandy, what have you done?

59:09.824 --> 59:12.158
Please, please, we
won't tell anyone!

59:12.160 --> 59:16.196
She doesn't realize that
what she's doing is bad.

59:16.198 --> 59:19.467
I tried to change her ways,

59:19.469 --> 59:24.037
I tried to change
her ways every time,

59:24.039 --> 59:26.207
but after what happened.

59:26.209 --> 59:29.142
What the fuck is going on?

59:29.144 --> 59:32.647
The children locked
her in the church,

59:34.516 --> 59:35.617
and left her there

59:36.386 --> 59:38.718
for a week.

59:38.720 --> 59:42.556
No one knew, because the
church was being repaired,

59:42.558 --> 59:45.228
and froze to the
death in the church.

59:47.430 --> 59:49.597
The priest found her.

59:49.599 --> 59:50.633
I'm so sorry.

59:52.168 --> 59:54.236
How did you even get her?

59:54.238 --> 59:56.371
Mandy was passed down

59:56.373 --> 59:59.208
my family from
generation to generation.

01:00:02.179 --> 01:00:03.478
All of us knowing

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.617
that her soul was still
trapped inside the doll.

01:00:09.852 --> 01:00:12.321
Look in the bag.

01:00:12.323 --> 01:00:13.456
What bag?

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:15.123
On the floor.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:16.592
Look what they were doing.

01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:20.095
No.

01:00:20.097 --> 01:00:21.932
Please no, that's
not what you think.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.434
Ms. O'Brien,

01:00:24.436 --> 01:00:26.235
I'm so sorry,

01:00:26.237 --> 01:00:27.537
I'm so sorry.

01:00:27.539 --> 01:00:30.540
I let you into my house

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:32.241
to look after Mandy,

01:00:32.243 --> 01:00:33.944
and you steal from me!

01:00:34.678 --> 01:00:37.146
Truly Ms. O'Brien,

01:00:37.148 --> 01:00:38.481
I'm so

01:00:38.483 --> 01:00:39.250
sorry.

01:00:40.285 --> 01:00:42.419
Ms. O'Brien, truly.

01:00:55.301 --> 01:00:56.366
Please,

01:00:56.368 --> 01:00:57.103
please.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.573
Oh, thank you, thank you,

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:03.873
we won't say
anything, I promise.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:05.509
Carly, Carly let's go,

01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:06.777
- let's go.
- Go?

01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:10.047
You're not going anywhere
now you know my secret.

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:14.284
Mandy, teach these girls some
real discipline, could you?

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:20.958
Can you see me?

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.692
Carly, no!

01:01:21.694 --> 01:01:24.562
I can see you.

01:01:24.564 --> 01:01:25.930
No!

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.334
Let's get on with
this, shall we.

01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:51.858
Let me go, please.

01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:53.793
Let me in!

01:01:55.662 --> 01:01:57.329
The door!

01:01:57.331 --> 01:01:59.565
Open the door will you?

01:02:00.668 --> 01:02:01.769
Open the door!

01:02:57.393 --> 01:03:01.630
You're going to be like
Mandy's friends soon.

01:03:01.632 --> 01:03:03.967
She wants to keep you.

01:03:11.874 --> 01:03:13.377
Amber!

01:03:14.645 --> 01:03:15.878
Carly.

01:03:49.214 --> 01:03:50.048
Carly?

01:03:51.016 --> 01:03:52.883
Oh, you came back.

01:03:53.618 --> 01:03:55.818
Of course I did.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.555
I wouldn't leave
you like Mom did.

01:03:58.623 --> 01:03:59.821
Where is she?

01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:00.892
She's on the landing.

01:04:02.595 --> 01:04:04.093
How are you gonna
get out of here?

01:04:04.095 --> 01:04:06.932
We're gonna get out of
here, we're gonna fight.

01:04:08.734 --> 01:04:09.966
Can you get up?

01:04:09.968 --> 01:04:12.803
Yeah, yeah I think so.

01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:13.904
Amber, I can't see.

01:04:13.906 --> 01:04:16.540
- I can't see, Amber.
- You're okay.

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:29.520
Mandy.

01:04:29.522 --> 01:04:31.458
Oh Mandy, where are you?

01:04:34.661 --> 01:04:35.494
Help me.

01:04:37.963 --> 01:04:40.598
She's gonna see
us, she's gonna see us.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.866
Shh!

01:04:41.868 --> 01:04:43.868
- We have to go,
- Where are you Mandy?

01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:45.537
we have to go.

01:04:45.539 --> 01:04:47.872
It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:47.874 --> 01:04:51.011
- It's okay, shh.
- She's gonna see us.

01:04:56.784 --> 01:04:58.550
Don't look.

01:04:58.552 --> 01:04:59.919
It's okay.

01:04:59.921 --> 01:05:01.387
Okay, okay, okay.

01:05:01.389 --> 01:05:04.824
Shh, shh, okay, okay, okay,
come on, come on, come on!

01:05:04.826 --> 01:05:06.894
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.030
Oh Mandy!

01:05:17.271 --> 01:05:18.106
Amber.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.448
Hey look, Carly,
it's the door.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:30.883
We're gonna make it.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.353
I wanna go, come on, come on.

01:05:33.355 --> 01:05:34.356
Okay, okay.

01:05:35.524 --> 01:05:36.724
- Amber.
- What?

01:05:36.726 --> 01:05:37.958
- Have you got the cash?
- What?

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.493
Have you got the cash?

01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:40.427
No.

01:05:40.429 --> 01:05:41.928
- Just come on.
- No, come on, shut up.

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.397
- Get the door, get the door.
- No.

01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:45.298
Carly, Carly, Carly!

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.068
Carly!

01:05:47.837 --> 01:05:49.104
Carly, Carly!

01:05:56.479 --> 01:05:57.246
Carly!

01:05:57.946 --> 01:05:59.546
Carly?

01:05:59.548 --> 01:06:00.548
Carly?

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:01.284
Carly?

01:06:04.788 --> 01:06:05.622
Carly!

01:06:11.594 --> 01:06:12.430
Carly!

01:06:18.335 --> 01:06:19.368
Carly?

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.968
Carly?

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:24.939
Carly no, no, no, no,
no, no, no please!

01:06:24.941 --> 01:06:25.975
No Carly!

01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:29.210
Carly don't, stay
with me, please!

01:06:29.212 --> 01:06:33.248
Carly, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.216
Carly!

01:06:34.218 --> 01:06:37.288
Carly, Carly, please,
please, please.

01:06:38.824 --> 01:06:40.524
Please, please no.

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:43.959
I need you, I need you.

01:06:50.034 --> 01:06:51.101
No, no, no!

01:06:51.969 --> 01:06:53.001
Oh my god!

01:06:53.003 --> 01:06:53.972
Oh my god!

01:07:27.707 --> 01:07:28.774
No!

01:07:31.745 --> 01:07:32.578
Why!

01:07:33.579 --> 01:07:34.413
Why!

01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:37.983
You can't leave!

01:07:37.985 --> 01:07:40.885
You can't leave me on my own!

01:07:40.887 --> 01:07:42.087
No!

01:07:42.089 --> 01:07:44.556
You can't leave me!

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:05.274
Do you think you're
gonna be happy here?

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.143
Yeah.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:12.014
Look at all this farmland,

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.149
all these animals
you can take care of.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.653
It's gonna be great.

01:09:17.888 --> 01:09:18.756
It's beautiful.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.026
This is gonna be a new
start for both of us,

01:09:24.028 --> 01:09:26.296
I think it's what
we need, don't you?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.131
Yeah, it'd be good

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:34.669
to have a fresh outlook on

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.106
life.

01:09:36.108 --> 01:09:38.341
Look, loosing a baby
is very difficult.

01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:41.644
We'll get you through it.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:45.046
Just remember that
you're my baby,

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:47.484
and I wanna look after you.

01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:49.821
Thanks, Mom.

01:10:40.907 --> 01:10:42.206
Ra!

01:10:44.677 --> 01:10:45.411
Mom!

01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.849
Oh come on, you're
supposed to be helping me.

01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:52.983
What have you got there?

01:10:52.985 --> 01:10:55.221
Oh my god, what is that?

01:10:57.423 --> 01:10:58.992
It's like when I got Rebecca.

01:11:00.195 --> 01:11:03.260
Alright, you've got
to stop doing this,

01:11:03.262 --> 01:11:05.398
relating everything
back to what's happened.

01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:08.233
It's a new start,

01:11:08.235 --> 01:11:10.269
leaving the past
behind, remember?

01:11:11.806 --> 01:11:12.640
Yeah.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.740
This,

01:11:14.742 --> 01:11:17.810
I hope you didn't get
her anything like this.

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.478
This is ghastly, look at it.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.115
Why has grandad got that?

01:11:22.117 --> 01:11:23.516
I don't know.

01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:25.118
He used to give
dolls out, I think,

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.284
when we were younger,

01:11:26.286 --> 01:11:28.888
but I don't remember this one.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:30.157
It's creepy.

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:31.824
Yeah.

01:11:31.826 --> 01:11:32.925
Best place for this.

01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:39.866
The best place for
this, is the bin.

01:11:39.868 --> 01:11:42.838
Come on, let's go
look somewhere else.

01:11:44.405 --> 01:11:48.142
I think you need to
get this door sorted.

01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.459
Mom?

01:13:19.239 --> 01:13:20.472
Mom?

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:26.874
Mom?

01:14:36.352 --> 01:14:37.585
Mom?

01:14:51.766 --> 01:14:52.600
Mom?

01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:58.139
She's found a new home now.

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:05.347
Oh my god!

01:15:05.349 --> 01:15:06.515
No!
