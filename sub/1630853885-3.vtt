00:10.093 --> 00:12.054
<i>The day after
Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans,</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:13.931
<i>everybody thought we got so lucky,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.557
that everything was gonna be fine.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.351
And it was fine.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.562
The sun was out, water pulled back.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.526
And then we learned the levees had broken.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.448
<i>All this water
started pouring into the city,</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:34.409
<i>and there was no way to stop it.</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:40.040
Did you have any idea
how bad things would get at Memorial?

00:41.750 --> 00:42.793
Nobody knew.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.214
Nobody knew.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.968
When you look back at what happened,

00:51.051 --> 00:52.886
what stands out to you the most?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.472
What stands out?

01:05.440 --> 01:08.235
I guess what stands out to me
is that it was just five days.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.408
It only took five days
for everything to fall apart.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.078
How was Dr. Pou during all this?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.581
- How was she--
- How was her--

01:20.664 --> 01:23.709
If you were to describe her behavior
over those five days?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.336
The same as everybody.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.090
The circumstances reveal
who you really are.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.724
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:46.273
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

01:47.357 --> 01:52.154
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:57.451
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

01:57.534 --> 02:02.122
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:02.206 --> 02:07.503
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

02:07.586 --> 02:11.590
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:17.471
<i>Man went down to the river, Lord</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:21.725
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:26.230
<i>Went down there for to pray</i>

02:27.856 --> 02:31.693
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:32.945 --> 02:37.783
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

02:37.866 --> 02:41.745
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:47.459
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

02:52.589 --> 02:58.595
<i>God's gonna trouble these waters</i>

03:08.939 --> 03:11.316
When are they going to get us out of here?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.036
That's good. That's--

03:24.413 --> 03:27.040
Okay. That'll get some air in here.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.543
I know it's stuffy. I know it is hot.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.045
But I need everybody to be real still
and listen.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.422
Whatever else you've heard,

03:33.505 --> 03:36.175
whatever talk's going around,
I'm gonna tell you straight.

03:36.258 --> 03:40.512
There has been a break
in the 17th Street Canal levee.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.683
Maybe a couple of others.
And the city pumps aren't working.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.853
Water is coming,
and it's gonna keep coming.

03:47.936 --> 03:52.441
The hospital will be flooded,
maybe to the second floor.

03:52.524 --> 03:56.653
We have to evacuate,
and we have to start moving now.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.155
Evacuate to where?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.865
There's looting going on outside.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.117
Hold on.
I do not know what's going on out there,

04:02.201 --> 04:04.369
but I know that
there are 15 feet of water coming here.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.997
We will be cut off, without power.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.584
And when the basement goes, we'll lose the
rest of our food, our supplies down there.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.212
- We're already running short on medicines.
- Why would we evacuate

04:13.295 --> 04:15.005
when the National Guard are here?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.007
I don't know how long they're gonna stay.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.675
They're being redeployed
all over the city.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.177
And we need to get out of here

04:20.260 --> 04:22.721
before we lose the rest of the power
in the building.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.805
We have generators.

04:23.889 --> 04:27.267
When the water gets to four feet,
it's gonna flood the electrical switches

04:27.351 --> 04:28.685
and they're gonna shut down.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.188
The water's coming in
at about one foot an hour.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.440
So, worst-case, we got four hours.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.609
- Great.
- Anything other than that is luck.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.612
How do we get the patients out?

04:38.695 --> 04:42.282
We talked to the National Guard about
getting some vehicles.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.661
We're talking to our contractors
about getting some ambulances out here.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.871
Sandra has been emailing Tenet

04:47.955 --> 04:52.459
to see if they can contract some private
helicopters, or if the Coast Guard--

04:52.543 --> 04:55.671
Can they even?
I mean, can helicopters even land here?

04:55.754 --> 04:58.715
When was the last time
anyone used the landing pad?

04:59.383 --> 05:01.218
Was when the Pope was here.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.636
That was in 1991.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.638
The pope was here in 1987.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.681
Perfect.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.641
Eighteen years?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.184
Seriously?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.144
It's been 18 years since you used the pad?

05:11.228 --> 05:13.355
Even if the pad is operational,

05:13.438 --> 05:16.692
the garage elevators aren't wired
into the backup electricity system.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.485
They're not working.

05:18.569 --> 05:22.239
There's no way to get the patients
directly from the hospital to the helipad.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.575
Do any of y'all
have an engineering background?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.784
Any kind of engineering?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.286
- Anybody?
- Yep.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.248
Go with Eric, and I need you
to start looking over the pad.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.209
I need you to decide
whether it's stable or not.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.503
Decide? How?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.463
I need you to decide.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.843
- Well, come on. Let's go.
- All right.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.097
We will find a way
to get the patients to the pad.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.974
We'll figure something out.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.561
Right now, I need you all
to start talking to your teams.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.605
The city water is fouled.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.108
Do not use,
do not drink from any of the taps.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.904
And the bottled water, we have to
let that stretch for 2,000 people…

06:17.586 --> 06:20.672
<i>Hey. It's Vince.
Anna and I can't come to the phone.</i>

06:23.050 --> 06:24.968
Vince, it's me again.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.803
Call me soon as you can, all right?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.931
I'm all right but call me.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.269
- Can everybody come here?
- What'd they say in the meeting?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.188
Everybody, come over here, please.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.944
I need all of you to be very calm, okay?
Can you do that?

06:42.027 --> 06:45.197
Diane? They're evacuating the hospital.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.281
Who's evacuating?

06:46.365 --> 06:48.450
Memorial.
I heard they're getting everybody out.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.744
- We're gonna have to evacuate.
- Evacuate the floor?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.205
- The whole hospital.
- Evacuate when?

06:53.288 --> 06:55.290
Now. Right now.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.169
Are they taking us with them? How are we
supposed to get our patients out?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.088
Who is in charge?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.050
- Diane?
- Stay with your mom.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.511
- What's going on?
- Just stay with your mother, okay?

07:26.488 --> 07:32.035
<i>Jesus, keep me near the cross</i>

07:40.544 --> 07:43.463
<i>A precious fountain</i>

07:48.260 --> 07:53.140
<i>Free to all, a healing stream</i>

07:55.809 --> 08:00.981
<i>Flows from Calvary's mountain</i>

08:02.900 --> 08:08.071
<i>Near the cross, I'll watch and wait</i>

08:08.822 --> 08:14.828
<i>Hoping, trusting ever</i>

08:16.872 --> 08:22.586
<i>Till I reach the golden strand</i>

08:23.504 --> 08:29.968
<i>Just beyond the river</i>

08:31.678 --> 08:33.179
There's water coming in.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.099
It's filling up the parking lot.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.770
Just stay there.
Just stay with my mom, okay?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.606
Yeah, I'm here.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.109
I figured they gotta be
setting up checkpoints around the city,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.403
letting people out
but not letting people in.

08:49.238 --> 08:53.867
If we can find a base of operations
or marshaling point,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.162
and get ourselves
some volunteer credentials,

08:57.246 --> 09:00.374
we can get into the city
and make our way to the hospital.

09:00.457 --> 09:04.211
Yeah, but if we do all this and they've
already got your mom out, then…

09:04.294 --> 09:06.255
Well, what if they haven't?

09:07.381 --> 09:08.924
I mean, what if they can't?

09:09.007 --> 09:12.261
I mean, the power's out
and the water's rising.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.054
But it's a hospital.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.140
Without power, it's not a hospital.
It's just a building.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.977
Look, one way or the other,
it's better to get there

09:20.060 --> 09:22.688
than just stay here, praying for a call
that's never gonna come.

09:24.439 --> 09:28.151
I mean, she's my mom. I'm not leaving her.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.534
We should find a fire station.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.829
The city's gonna be calling in
emergency personnel,

09:38.912 --> 09:42.291
and if they are, maybe we can
tag with them and work our way in.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.793
We'll get your mom.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.172
However we have to, we'll get her.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.019
<i>Susan?</i>

10:02.978 --> 10:05.022
- Diane Robichaux from LifeCare.
- Hi.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.732
Are you evacuating the hospital?

10:06.815 --> 10:07.816
Yes.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.444
Why am I just finding out?

10:10.527 --> 10:12.779
How are we
supposed to evacuate our patients?

10:12.863 --> 10:15.157
You're a private hospital.
You don't have your own plan?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.493
We can't contact anyone. We don't even
have any of our doctors up there.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.537
You can't communicate
with your corporate offices?

10:20.621 --> 10:22.080
I mean, barely.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.751
See if they can get in touch with the
Coast Guard or any private air charter,

10:25.834 --> 10:28.420
and if our helipad is operational,
I will let you know.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.422
And get me
a list of your critical patients.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.632
That's most of them.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.467
Just get me a list
and we'll do what we can.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.802
But right now,
we can't even help ourselves.

10:36.595 --> 10:37.679
Anything?

10:37.763 --> 10:40.265
I got a phone number
for some Air National Guard officer.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.601
That's a Baton Rouge number.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.894
- He's supposed to be coordinating--
- Did you call?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.479
- I couldn't get through--
- What about Tenet?

10:45.562 --> 10:48.065
- I've been emailing them, but--
- Email them again and tell them

10:48.148 --> 10:50.150
- that we are running out of time.
- I told them--

10:50.234 --> 10:52.778
They are our parent corporation,
for Christ's sake.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.905
Tell them that we have
about four hours left

10:54.988 --> 10:56.573
before we lose power and we need help.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.658
I'm trying.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.453
I know you are.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.873
Just let me know
when you hear anything, okay?

11:05.457 --> 11:06.291
Yeah.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.462
<i>This was a common sight today.</i>

11:10.546 --> 11:13.674
<i>Helicopters and rescue teams,
lifting people one by one,</i>

11:13.757 --> 11:16.093
<i>hundreds and hundreds,
and all from rooftops.</i>

11:16.176 --> 11:18.637
<i>New Orleans
thought it had been spared the worst,</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:22.641
<i>and then two major levees broke and,
slowly, the city has filled with water.</i>

11:22.724 --> 11:25.060
<i>Canal Street is now a canal.</i>

11:25.143 --> 11:28.772
<i>This city is going to be, essentially,
uninhabitable for many days.</i>

11:28.856 --> 11:32.234
<i>The city that sits
below sea level is now undersea.</i>

11:32.317 --> 11:35.821
<i>Overnight there were two breaches in the
levee system that protects New Orleans.</i>

11:35.904 --> 11:37.072
<i>One in 200…</i>

11:37.155 --> 11:39.449
Hey, we just got another email
from Memorial in New Orlean--

11:39.533 --> 11:41.201
- What?
- Memorial, in New Orleans.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.453
They got to evacuate patients.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.706
<i>I mean, everything's been flooded.</i>

11:46.206 --> 11:47.833
Sounds kinda panicky, right?

11:49.126 --> 11:51.461
- I mean, what should we do?
- Do? Like--

11:51.545 --> 11:54.381
I mean, is there any kind
of emergency procedure or anything, or--

11:54.464 --> 11:56.133
Just forward the email to somebody.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
These emails are going wide.
No one's responding.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.803
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

12:04.349 --> 12:08.187
Michael. The pro formas for SC.
Can I get you to sign off?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.313
Yeah.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.232
You want me to do this now?

12:12.316 --> 12:13.901
Like to get it out by tomorrow.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.613
Can we do this later?

12:17.696 --> 12:20.157
- Well, we have to get them to print.
- I'll be right back.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.673
- Steve?
- Hi.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.592
We're getting emails.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.220
One of our hospitals,
there was flooding after the hurricane,

12:41.303 --> 12:43.222
- and they need to evacuate.
- Okay?

12:43.764 --> 12:44.973
They're asking for help.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.976
- I guess, I'm wondering do we have any--
- Do we?

12:48.060 --> 12:51.772
Does the company have any contracts
with medical transport companies

12:51.855 --> 12:54.107
or is there an evacuation plan?
Is there anybody that may--

12:54.191 --> 12:56.360
I wouldn't know about any emergency plans.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.445
Isn't there somebody in Louisiana?

12:58.529 --> 13:00.614
I mean, we're business development.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.741
Right.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.244
Just sounds like they really need help.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.788
- I don't know.
- Look, well…

13:11.083 --> 13:13.752
Hey, Michael. Wait.

13:15.087 --> 13:19.049
Who's that one VP?
Used to be in the National Guard?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.760
- Which one?
- It's Portis, I think.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.721
- Now, go look him up in the directory.
- Great.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.224
- All right. Keep me in the loop.
- Yeah. Will do.

13:47.286 --> 13:48.996
<i>Alan Portis's office.</i>

13:49.079 --> 13:51.790
Hi. This is Michael Arvin
with Tenet in Dallas. I'm trying--

13:51.874 --> 13:53.500
<i>I'm sorry. What was the name?</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:57.087
Michael Arvin. I'm the Director of
Business Development for Tenet Gulf Coast.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.131
We've got an emergency in New Orleans.

13:59.214 --> 14:03.260
One of our hospitals, at least one,
is requesting emergency services and I--

14:03.343 --> 14:06.513
<i>Mr. Portis is on vacation.
I can take a message.</i>

14:06.597 --> 14:09.224
- Can you reach him?
-<i>Mr. Portis is on vacation.</i>

14:09.308 --> 14:14.104
There's a hospital-- a company hospital,
that is being flooded and needs help.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.106
I really need to speak to Mr. Portis.

14:18.275 --> 14:22.029
- Hello?
-<i>Hold, please.</i>

14:25.782 --> 14:27.993
Hey, would you turn up the TV a bit?

14:28.493 --> 14:31.580
<i>The water here is a foot deep.
The water there, much deeper.</i>

14:31.663 --> 14:35.751
<i>Twelve hours ago, we drove on these
streets and they were completely dry.</i>

14:35.834 --> 14:37.044
<i>Mr. Arvin?</i>

14:37.127 --> 14:38.170
Yeah, I'm here.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.215
-<i>You have Mr. Portis.</i>
-<i>Hello.</i>

14:41.298 --> 14:42.508
Mr. Portis. Michael Arvin.

14:42.591 --> 14:45.260
I'm the Director of Business Development
for Tenet Gulf Coast.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.512
<i>Yes?</i>

14:46.595 --> 14:49.223
We've got an emergency in New Orleans.
We're getting these emails

14:49.306 --> 14:52.142
that one of our hospitals
is requesting emergency services,

14:52.226 --> 14:54.394
and I was told
you might have been in the National Guard.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.479
<i>That's right.</i>

14:56.605 --> 14:58.774
Well, I was wondering, do you
have any contacts at National Guard?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.735
- Anybody I might be able to reach out--
-<i>No. No, I don't.</i>

15:02.569 --> 15:06.281
Do you have thoughts about somebody who
I might be able to get in contact with--

15:06.365 --> 15:07.824
<i>I'm not at the office right now.</i>

15:07.908 --> 15:10.536
These emails are sounding urgent.
I don't think this is able to wait.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.247
<i>Call the National Guard.
They're probably coordinating something.</i>

16:14.766 --> 16:16.393
Yeah. I'm trying to get some kinda number

16:16.476 --> 16:19.271
for the Louisiana National Guard
or the Coast Guard.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.940
Yeah, I'll hold.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.318
<i>...do not have enough.
Unprepared and overwhelmed.</i>

16:26.653 --> 16:28.530
<i>…headed for higher ground.</i>

16:39.291 --> 16:41.668
Come on. Keep them coming.

16:42.252 --> 16:46.757
More. That's it. Come on.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.674
How are we supposed to
get 200 patients up here this way?

17:28.757 --> 17:29.758
Yeah.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.695
Hey, come on.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.198
- We gotta check the structure, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.804
Jesus.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.568
Anything?

19:11.652 --> 19:14.863
There's corrosion.
It's everywhere, all the metal.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.573
How bad?

19:16.657 --> 19:19.326
I don't know how bad.
All I can tell you is what I see.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.371
Maybe we can fit a bone saw up here.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.791
Cut through some of this metal,
and see how pervasive the corrosion is.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.794
Now, before we start
landing any helicopters up here,

19:28.877 --> 19:31.171
better make goddamn sure
this thing can take the weight.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.593
Okay.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.638
- Freddy.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

19:40.138 --> 19:44.351
Yeah, I'm coming down.
I need some kinda saw. A steel cutter.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.646
-<i>Steel cutter?</i>
- Yeah, and I need it fast.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.453
No.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.165
No!

20:08.208 --> 20:09.376
No!

20:10.085 --> 20:11.378
No!

20:28.687 --> 20:30.981
Hey! Hey, come here.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.774
- Me?
- You! Come here.

20:36.987 --> 20:38.280
Do you need help?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.364
Yeah.

20:40.449 --> 20:41.867
Guard 5-8-5, I'm at…

20:42.659 --> 20:45.621
- Where am I?
- Baptist Memorial Hospital.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.999
Baptist Memorial Hospital.
Medical personnel requesting evac.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.336
Copy that.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.921
I can evac one person.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.214
- One?
- One. Hurry.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.800
<i>There are almost 200 patients
we have to evacuate.</i>

20:58.884 --> 21:02.262
We need to discuss who's going first
and who's going last.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.682
<i>I think that the most sick patients,</i>

21:05.766 --> 21:08.852
<i>the ones who are most dependent on life
support or mechanical aid,</i>

21:08.936 --> 21:10.103
should go out first.

21:10.187 --> 21:12.814
<i>So, that's almost two dozen in the ICU.</i>

21:12.898 --> 21:15.817
We can't care for any of them
if and when the power goes out.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.362
Same with the neonates,
those on ventilators.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.905
<i>They're not gonna survive.</i>

21:19.988 --> 21:24.785
<i>We have several high-risk pregnant
mothers, half dozen dialysis patients,</i>

21:24.868 --> 21:27.454
<i>and two bone marrow transplant patients.</i>

21:27.538 --> 21:31.083
All of them have to get to acute care
as soon as possible,

21:31.166 --> 21:34.711
and after that,
we move the more stable patients,

21:34.795 --> 21:38.841
then the civilians and families,
then staff, and, last, doctors.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.092
Sorry.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.718
Can we agree on that?

21:45.764 --> 21:46.765
Yes.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.563
All right.
Now, the National Guard has promised

21:52.646 --> 21:56.608
to move 35 medical
and surgical patients out by truck.

21:56.692 --> 21:58.360
Thirty-five? That's it?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.279
Well, that's what they said. They--

22:00.362 --> 22:03.365
There's a helicopter.
There's a helicopter up on the pad.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.741
How did a helicopter pilot think--

22:04.825 --> 22:07.703
I was standing there. I was waving.
He thought I was signaling him.

22:07.786 --> 22:08.871
- He says--
- Is he from Tenet?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.914
- How many are they sending?
- Just listen to me.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.875
He says he can take one patient,
but we have to hurry.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.626
- What, one?
- One.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.297
- The neonates. Take one of the neonates.
- Okay.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.524
Sandra, the helipad's operational.

22:37.608 --> 22:40.194
- Let Tenet know we can take helicopters.
- Yes. Copy.

22:40.277 --> 22:43.363
Karen, the helipad's operational.
Get your patients ready to move.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.533
<i>We're sending the neonates first
and everybody in the ICU.</i>

22:46.617 --> 22:47.618
Got it.

22:49.203 --> 22:52.164
We're gonna start moving the patients,
okay? Let's go.

22:58.754 --> 23:00.339
Okay. There's a helicopter.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.383
The sickest baby, bring it.
Get the rest ready to move.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.052
- Take Baby Edmonds.
- Okay.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.983
Let's go. Pile that door.

23:21.610 --> 23:22.653
Over here.

23:23.654 --> 23:25.906
Steve. I just heard from Memor--

23:25.989 --> 23:27.032
Hold on one second.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.785
I just heard from Memorial.
They can take helicopters.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.329
I got a hospital in Baton Rouge
willing to take patients.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.706
I'm trying to contact
some private helicopter companies,

23:34.790 --> 23:36.667
and we got a couple hospitals in Atlanta
offering evacuation support.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.751
No. No sky--

23:38.335 --> 23:41.088
The company's saying it needs to be
Coast Guard, National Guard.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.131
I've been in touch with them.
They know the situation.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.341
Atlanta wants to help.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.344
Mike, this isn't airlifting
from a car accident.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.055
This is flooding. This is rescue. Okay?

23:50.138 --> 23:53.642
It's the military. That's what they do.
Let 'em do it, okay?

23:55.394 --> 23:56.395
Okay?

23:56.478 --> 23:57.479
Okay.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.108
Yeah, I'm here.

24:01.191 --> 24:06.321
Memorial can take helicopters, but
we're going to try to use the Coast Guard.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.533
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.037
<i>...a possible doomsday scenario.</i>

24:14.121 --> 24:16.665
<i>The water keeps rising here
at an alarming rate,</i>

24:16.748 --> 24:19.418
<i>and Mayor Ray Nagin says
that if the Army Corps of Engineers</i>

24:19.501 --> 24:23.130
<i>cannot patch that break in the levee,
then by the end of today,</i>

24:23.213 --> 24:27.009
<i>all of downtown New Orleans,
even the parts that are above sea level,</i>

24:27.092 --> 24:28.802
<i>could be completely underwater.</i>

24:36.643 --> 24:37.728
Careful.

24:38.312 --> 24:40.397
Watch it. Swing. All right.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.274
- Just…
- All right. On three.

24:42.357 --> 24:45.027
- Okay, ready? Let's go.
- One, two, three.

24:46.278 --> 24:47.279
Okay.

24:48.906 --> 24:50.365
Yep. Keep it level.

24:51.241 --> 24:52.868
- Easy.
- Careful, step.

24:56.622 --> 24:59.291
- Easy.
- Okay. Turn.

25:01.210 --> 25:03.253
Ready? Watch your feet.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.220
Okay, here we go.

25:14.348 --> 25:16.350
- I can't lift it anymore.
- Okay.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.520
Little slower. God.

25:20.729 --> 25:21.730
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay.

25:22.314 --> 25:23.649
I'm good.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.320
Hey, wait. We gotta give her oxygen.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.031
- Give me a second.
- She good?

25:31.532 --> 25:33.534
Is she good? Let's go.

25:33.617 --> 25:36.537
All right, ready?

25:37.454 --> 25:39.289
Guys, that's it.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.338
Hey, what the fuck were you doing?
That took too long!

25:46.421 --> 25:48.882
- The elevator's not working.
- Then figure something out.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.801
People need help
and we can't waste time here.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.303
Get her in. Let's go. Hurry up.

25:53.387 --> 25:55.597
- We gotta go.
- Come on.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.516
Now move back!

25:58.225 --> 26:01.478
- Now, move back. Move!
- She's not coming back.

26:05.774 --> 26:06.775
All right!

26:08.068 --> 26:09.486
All clear, let's go!

26:43.020 --> 26:45.647
<i>If we can get the neonates
out by helicopter,</i>

26:45.731 --> 26:48.233
35 patients by National Guard transport,

26:48.317 --> 26:50.402
then that leaves us with what?

26:50.485 --> 26:54.615
<i>A hundred and fifty patients,
plus doctors, plus staff, plus civilians.</i>

26:54.698 --> 26:57.576
Do we need to consider
as we're prioritizing patients.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.579
I think the DNRs should go last.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.496
Why?

27:02.247 --> 27:05.083
Well, they've already signed
a Do Not Resuscitate order.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.377
<i>They've indicated
they don't want to be saved.</i>

27:07.461 --> 27:08.462
Well, that's not--

27:09.171 --> 27:11.590
A DNR doesn't mean don't save a person.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.676
A DNR means if a person codes
you don't revive them.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.429
Well, for a patient to get a DNR
they have to have a certified termin--

27:17.513 --> 27:19.181
No. That's--

27:19.681 --> 27:22.184
- You're misunderstanding what a DNR act--
- No, Richard.

27:22.267 --> 27:25.020
Why prioritize DNR patients now?

27:25.103 --> 27:29.608
Look, we've only got four patients
in the ICU who have DNRs. Four.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.486
And what we're talking about
is a last resort contingency.

27:33.237 --> 27:36.782
If you could get four healthy patients out
versus four who are terminal, wouldn't--

27:38.200 --> 27:41.161
I think we should bring
Susan in on this conversation.

27:44.081 --> 27:47.209
She's the one in charge. Right?

27:57.553 --> 27:58.554
Right there.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.853
Go. Come on.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.542
Yeah, go on through.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.150
Okay. There we go.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.827
Slow down. Conserve it, okay?

29:05.954 --> 29:07.414
Yeah. And save some for yourself,

29:07.497 --> 29:09.583
'cause when you get dehydrated,
you can't help anybody.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.301
Jane?

29:21.386 --> 29:22.471
Jane?

29:23.096 --> 29:25.098
What's going on?
Her heart monitor's disconnected?

29:25.182 --> 29:27.226
We were told that nonessential care
was being suspended

29:27.309 --> 29:31.230
- because we're evacuating patients.
- Told? Told by who?

29:31.313 --> 29:33.357
- Dr. Cook said tha--
- I don't care what he said.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.192
She's my patient. Reattach her monitor.

29:36.026 --> 29:37.569
I should check with Dr. Cook.

29:38.654 --> 29:39.738
Excuse me?

29:40.280 --> 29:41.281
I should check with do--

29:41.365 --> 29:44.743
You don't have to check with anybody.
Reattach her monitor.

29:46.078 --> 29:50.082
You know what? Fuck that.

29:58.257 --> 30:00.634
Nurse, I said
that all nonessential care was suspended.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.720
This woman isn't nonessential.
She needs to be continuously monitored.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.472
- I--
- Disconnect that heart monitor.

30:06.223 --> 30:09.184
- You know, if you have something to say…
- Do not reconnect it unless I tell you.

30:09.268 --> 30:12.521
- She is my patient. But she is my patient!
- We don't have time for nonsense.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.649
I am in charge of this floor,
and I've told you what to do.

30:17.317 --> 30:20.654
I'm not going to be dictated to
by some junior physician.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.699
Do you understand?

30:36.378 --> 30:37.921
So fucking...

31:04.573 --> 31:06.491
Hey, who's in charge?

31:07.868 --> 31:08.911
That guy over there.

31:09.786 --> 31:10.787
Thank you.

31:13.165 --> 31:15.876
You're standing around, wasting time.

31:17.127 --> 31:19.254
Sir, you in charge?

31:19.922 --> 31:20.964
Who are you?

31:21.048 --> 31:22.633
We're just looking to help.

31:23.300 --> 31:26.178
If y'all are heading into New Orleans,
we'd like to do what we can.

31:26.261 --> 31:27.971
- We're not taking civvies.
- We're not civvies.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.223
I'm a paramedic.

31:30.432 --> 31:34.520
Look, I coordinate the EMT program
at Nunez Community College in Chalmette.

31:34.603 --> 31:37.731
If you want to call and ask,
my name is Sandra LeBlanc.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.859
I know what I'm doing, and I want to help.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.864
Jimmy! Bring me some paperwork!

31:47.407 --> 31:48.909
Now, get logged in.

31:48.992 --> 31:51.954
I need your names,
any training, next of kin.

31:53.413 --> 31:57.209
Got plenty of hands here.
When are y'all gonna move out?

31:58.001 --> 32:00.003
- I don't know.
- What are you waiting for?

32:01.046 --> 32:03.298
Somebody to figure out what to do with us.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.475
We got a National Guard truck, y'all.

32:24.778 --> 32:26.405
His oxygen's good.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.490
- She's all right. She's oxygenating.
- It's okay.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.078
Keep it coming. All right, watch out.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.423
You okay? You all right?

32:44.506 --> 32:46.175
- Right behind you.
- I'm okay.

32:46.258 --> 32:47.259
She's good.

32:54.141 --> 32:55.392
Careful.

32:55.475 --> 32:57.436
That's it. That's all we can get.

33:00.230 --> 33:01.982
- Okay, you coming?
- Careful.

33:02.649 --> 33:03.984
It's okay, baby. We got you.

33:07.613 --> 33:09.323
- So, where are you taking them?
- Texas.

33:09.406 --> 33:10.741
That's the closest hospital?

33:10.824 --> 33:12.826
That's what we were told,
that's where we're going.

33:15.412 --> 33:17.039
They just got you.

33:18.207 --> 33:19.708
Where'd they say they'd go?

33:23.545 --> 33:25.380
Keep your heads down until we exit.

33:25.464 --> 33:26.924
All right, you're good.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.050
Okay, that's it.

33:28.133 --> 33:30.761
That's only 20 patients.
You were supposed to take 35.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.304
That's all the room we've got.

33:33.555 --> 33:36.683
- Okay, so when is the next truck coming?
- Soon as it can. Are you coming?

33:38.727 --> 33:39.728
You should go.

33:41.271 --> 33:42.439
No, you go.

33:43.815 --> 33:47.194
It's all right. I mean,
what am I gonna do in Texas?

33:51.615 --> 33:53.158
All right. It's all right.

33:53.242 --> 33:54.868
What are we supposed to do?

34:01.416 --> 34:04.127
It's okay. The next one is coming.

34:04.211 --> 34:05.504
The next one is coming.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.511
That's it. Okay.

34:14.096 --> 34:15.097
Clear.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.817
This don't make no damn sense.

34:32.656 --> 34:34.449
Where are the helicopters?

34:34.533 --> 34:35.909
Oh, shit.

34:35.993 --> 34:37.953
Where the fuck are the helicopters?

34:40.539 --> 34:42.123
Tell somebody there are no helicopters.

35:03.562 --> 35:04.813
Oh, shit.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.232
Hey. Back off!

35:07.983 --> 35:09.693
Hey! Back off!

35:18.952 --> 35:22.539
Susan, we can't hold back the water.
It's gonna flood our panels.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.083
We're gonna lose our generators.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.668
<i>You said we had four hours.</i>

35:26.752 --> 35:29.755
<i>I said, "Best-case,
we've got four hours." We got minutes.</i>

35:30.506 --> 35:33.258
Susan. There are no helicopters.

35:33.884 --> 35:37.596
The neonates are up on the pad,
and there are no helicopters.

35:37.679 --> 35:42.184
Sandra? Where are the helicopters?

35:42.267 --> 35:43.852
<i>We have babies on the pad.</i>

35:44.686 --> 35:47.898
I don't know.
They said they would be there.

35:48.607 --> 35:51.485
<i>We need helicopters and we need them now!</i>

36:11.046 --> 36:15.384
<i>And days after Hurricane
Katrina hit, people are still stranded,</i>

36:15.467 --> 36:18.762
<i>hoping a passing helicopter
will pluck them away to safety.</i>

36:19.429 --> 36:21.849
<i>Frustration over the pace
of the federal relief effort</i>

36:21.932 --> 36:23.350
<i>has reached the boiling point.</i>

36:23.433 --> 36:26.937
<i>Today, blistering criticism.
The mayor of New Orleans.</i>

36:27.020 --> 36:29.273
<i>Now, get off your asses
and let's do something.</i>

36:29.356 --> 36:33.735
<i>And let's fix the biggest god******
crisis in the history of this country.</i>

36:46.373 --> 36:48.959
- All right.
- There's no way we're saving these panels!

36:49.459 --> 36:53.213
Yeah, let's get out of here.
It's too fucking dangerous. Come on.

36:53.297 --> 36:54.298
Come on.

37:03.599 --> 37:05.475
Nurse, is it gonna be okay?

37:14.401 --> 37:16.653
We can't run
the ventilators without power.

37:25.204 --> 37:29.291
<i>Search and rescue
operations go on from what FEMA now calls</i>

37:29.374 --> 37:33.545
<i>the most significant natural disaster
ever to hit the United States.</i>

37:33.629 --> 37:35.422
<i>…potentially devastating problem,</i>

37:35.506 --> 37:38.675
<i>because the Crescent City area
is below sea level.</i>

37:38.759 --> 37:40.886
<i>Tonight, darkness, of course, had fallen.</i>

37:40.969 --> 37:43.347
<i>And you can hear people yelling for help.</i>

37:43.430 --> 37:46.433
<i>You can hear the dogs yelping.</i>

37:46.517 --> 37:50.062
<i>All of them stranded.
All of them hoping someone will come.</i>

37:50.145 --> 37:52.981
<i>But for tonight, they've had to
suspend the rescue efforts.</i>

37:53.065 --> 37:55.734
<i>Water is still pouring
into that city. It's getting worse.</i>

37:55.817 --> 37:57.903
<i>Hundreds, if not thousands of people</i>

37:57.986 --> 38:02.241
<i>remain stranded on their roofs
or in their attics waiting to be rescued.</i>

38:02.324 --> 38:05.869
<i>Not only are there
floodwaters there, but it's dangerous.</i>

38:05.953 --> 38:09.581
<i>The violence, the looting,
the snipers. It's a dangerous situation.</i>

38:09.665 --> 38:11.959
<i>Those in New Orleans
have been talking about</i>

38:12.042 --> 38:14.920
<i>possibly evacuating two hospitals
in the area.</i>

38:15.003 --> 38:19.550
<i>But we have just now learned
that those plans have been put on hold.</i>

38:19.633 --> 38:22.052
<i>There are reports of multiple levees</i>

38:22.135 --> 38:23.887
<i>breached all around the city.</i>

38:23.971 --> 38:28.433
<i>Floodwaters rise,
chaos reigns, as a city falls into crisis.</i>

38:28.517 --> 38:32.855
<i>Don't know how we can impress
upon people what is really going on here.</i>

38:32.938 --> 38:34.898
<i>I think people just don't have a concept--</i>

38:34.982 --> 38:37.985
<i>Neighborhood
after neighborhood submerged in water.</i>

38:38.068 --> 38:43.073
<i>The number of the trapped, the missing,
the dead remains unknown.</i>

39:04.845 --> 39:07.222
You feeling like a little bit of water?

39:13.437 --> 39:15.647
- You okay?
- Susan. How y'all doing?

39:15.731 --> 39:19.818
Hey. Just letting my mother
get a little rest.

39:20.611 --> 39:24.781
Y'all have been out here all day.
I figured I could relieve some folks.

39:27.868 --> 39:30.120
Start letting everybody in your unit know

39:30.204 --> 39:32.623
that there aren't any more
National Guard trucks coming.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.626
Water's already too high,

39:37.461 --> 39:39.838
and they're pulling
the rest of their people out.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.382
What about our people?

39:46.303 --> 39:48.931
Corporate is doing everything they can.

40:00.817 --> 40:03.278
<i>Hospitals are without water, even power.</i>

40:03.362 --> 40:04.655
<i>So, how long can they keep it up?</i>

40:04.738 --> 40:07.199
<i>How are they gonna
get the critically ill out of the city?</i>

40:07.282 --> 40:10.035
<i>We have very little food,
very little water.</i>

40:10.118 --> 40:11.245
<i>And everybody's rationing.</i>

40:11.328 --> 40:14.081
<i>They-- What we're really concerned about</i>

40:14.164 --> 40:16.834
<i>is most of these ventilators
have been run by batteries</i>

40:16.917 --> 40:18.669
<i>and, well, we don't have batteries.</i>

40:18.752 --> 40:21.129
<i>And, unfortunately, they're gonna die
when we run out of batteries.</i>

40:21.213 --> 40:24.883
<i>Moments ago
massive explosions shake New Orleans.</i>

40:24.967 --> 40:29.054
<i>As the city spirals out of control,
there appears to be anarchy…</i>

40:29.721 --> 40:31.723
Nothing from anybody? No marching orders?

40:31.807 --> 40:32.933
None.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.601
Jesus.

40:35.727 --> 40:37.312
All right. Forget this.

40:37.396 --> 40:40.107
Get me the location of the closest SARBOO.
We're not sitting around anymore.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.191
Got it.

40:42.067 --> 40:44.278
All right, let's go. Gear up.
We're gonna move out.

40:44.361 --> 40:46.697
Come on. Everybody, find a vehicle.

40:46.780 --> 40:48.574
Make sure you've got some water
and take it with you.

40:48.657 --> 40:49.992
- About time.
- Come on.

40:50.075 --> 40:52.703
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, but we're moving.

40:53.871 --> 40:56.665
Get those flashlights.
We're going to work.

40:56.748 --> 41:00.085
All right. Let's go. Backup batteries too.

41:01.545 --> 41:02.754
Roll out.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.175
Load up the rig.

41:55.599 --> 41:58.143
There's nothing more precious
than life, you know?

41:58.936 --> 42:00.646
Not one single thing.

42:01.355 --> 42:04.608
I know. Trust me, I know.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.153
But thank you for the reminder.

42:08.946 --> 42:09.947
Boy or girl?

42:10.697 --> 42:12.449
That I do not know.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.868
Are you for real?
You got to be kidding me.

42:18.622 --> 42:21.291
There are darn few surprises left in life.

42:21.375 --> 42:24.962
You know, true, good surprises.

42:26.046 --> 42:29.508
Good Lord has blessed me with one,
and I will look forward to its reveal.

42:33.929 --> 42:36.557
Now, don't go getting down on me.

42:37.641 --> 42:40.644
You get sad and I get sad.

42:42.813 --> 42:45.148
Both of us got plenty to live for.

42:45.983 --> 42:47.401
Let's just leave it at that.

42:51.780 --> 42:52.781
Okay.

42:55.117 --> 42:57.411
Diane.

43:02.791 --> 43:04.376
Diane, a patient's coding.

43:10.007 --> 43:11.133
What happened?

43:11.216 --> 43:13.510
He went into pulseless V-fib.
No respirations.

43:13.594 --> 43:15.637
He's full code, and there's no DNR order.

43:15.721 --> 43:18.515
Go down to Memorial. Tell them we got
a patient coding and need a doctor.

43:18.599 --> 43:19.892
I'll get a crash cart.

43:22.477 --> 43:23.562
Hey, I need a doctor.

43:23.645 --> 43:26.106
- LifeCare, seventh floor. Code Blue.
- Can't anyone up there take it?

43:26.190 --> 43:28.483
There aren't any doctors up there.
We need somebody.

43:29.067 --> 43:31.528
Dr. Pou, Code Blue on seven.

43:31.612 --> 43:33.280
I'll go. Get an ER doctor.

43:37.367 --> 43:38.577
- Where?
- This way.

43:46.043 --> 43:47.336
Charging.

43:48.295 --> 43:50.380
- Everybody, stand back.
- Clear?

43:50.464 --> 43:51.840
Clear.

43:51.924 --> 43:54.551
- Shock delivered. All clear?
- Clear.

43:55.969 --> 43:57.346
- Now press.
- What's going on?

43:57.429 --> 44:00.307
Seventy-three-year-old male,
right-sided pneumonia, COPD,

44:00.390 --> 44:02.559
colitis, diabetes,
intermittent cardiac arrhythmia.

44:03.227 --> 44:05.229
- How long has he been coding?
- Ten minutes.

44:05.312 --> 44:06.355
Oh, boy.

44:06.438 --> 44:08.565
- Second dose of epi is in.
- Try again.

44:08.649 --> 44:10.108
Systolic is absent.

44:10.192 --> 44:11.443
All right, keep up.

44:11.527 --> 44:15.030
Okay, let's intubate him.
Stop the compression.

44:19.868 --> 44:21.078
Quick as you can.

44:21.995 --> 44:23.455
The patient is flatlining.

44:23.539 --> 44:24.623
Nothing.

44:25.457 --> 44:26.917
Start compression.

44:28.544 --> 44:29.962
Negative, negative.

44:32.339 --> 44:33.340
No response.

44:35.300 --> 44:37.052
Intubated. Starting airflow.

44:38.929 --> 44:42.099
Okay. Got no blood pressure.
Okay, continue those compressions.

44:42.182 --> 44:43.475
Anything?

44:43.559 --> 44:46.311
Still no vitals.
All right, just keep going.

44:46.395 --> 44:47.771
Do we have a heartbeat?

44:48.897 --> 44:50.148
There's nothing.

44:54.194 --> 44:55.195
Come on.

44:55.279 --> 44:57.072
Stop compression.

44:57.865 --> 45:00.242
Time of death, 10:15.

45:02.035 --> 45:03.912
<i>That's how it all began.</i>

45:03.996 --> 45:07.666
Us in the dark. Cut off. No power.

45:08.709 --> 45:13.380
Look, you all did your best.

45:15.299 --> 45:17.384
You all did the best you could.

45:20.596 --> 45:21.513
Thank you.

45:21.597 --> 45:23.807
<i>Yes.
You can't understand what it was like.</i>

45:26.685 --> 45:29.229
Even for us, even for doctors, death…

45:31.148 --> 45:32.316
isn't common.

45:32.816 --> 45:36.111
We save lives. We save them.

45:38.488 --> 45:41.033
But we went
from being able to save lives to…

45:47.497 --> 45:50.000
It doesn't take much
for everything to break down.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.629
And what happened next, we couldn't stop.

46:03.138 --> 46:04.181
I couldn't stop it.

46:07.434 --> 46:09.853
What was it you couldn't stop, doctor?

46:11.146 --> 46:12.981
You couldn't stop people from dying?

46:14.441 --> 46:16.652
Or you couldn't stop them
from being killed?
