WEBVTT

00:36.240 --> 00:37.720
There's no messages.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.800
He would have sent me one
if he disagreed.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.160
Then they should be on their way.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.040
Just wait here.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.160
Listen to me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.560
No, no, no. Is that understood?

01:41.480 --> 01:43.160
This is not the point.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.920
If it's an old woman
or a red devil, it doesn't matter.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.600
That's how this will work.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.560
What the fuck am I doing here?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.640
There are a few things
we have to clarify.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.120
I don't know who you are.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.240
Now that Bjørn passed away,
it's a new situation.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.280
We're under a new pressure.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.080
And we have to look
at different roles.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.600
Your role, for instance.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.080
BIRTHDAY GIRL

03:46.160 --> 03:48.920
YOU ARE INVITED
TO LINNEA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY!

04:00.200 --> 04:01.480
Hello?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.920
<i>Siem has leaked your name</i>
<i>and a picture of you.</i>

04:04.600 --> 04:08.400
<i>-Are you sure it was Siem?</i>
-Yes, dead sure.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.440
He's not a good guy.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.360
<i>There's a blurred picture of you</i>
<i>in Norway's biggest online newspaper.</i>

04:16.800 --> 04:20.720
<i>They don't use your real name, but</i>
<i>don't give them more to write about.</i>

04:21.520 --> 04:24.520
<i>If your name is leaked,</i>

04:24.600 --> 04:27.680
it's a short fucking road
to the Russian mob.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.440
<i>You don't have anything concrete?</i>

04:30.160 --> 04:35.080
<i>Ziminov could have sent people</i>
<i>we don't know, by train or car.</i>

04:35.160 --> 04:36.880
<i>Stay in Vestvik,</i>

04:36.960 --> 04:40.520
<i>live like normal,</i>
<i>and stay the fuck out of trouble.</i>

04:40.600 --> 04:42.000
UNKNOWN PAST

05:08.680 --> 05:10.640
Man is undoubtedly...

05:12.800 --> 05:14.960
the most evil of all beings.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.000
Don't get me wrong,
I'm no nihilist.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.720
I know we also have the capacity
for unbelievable goodness.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.280
When we are talking about goodness,
women stand out.

05:25.360 --> 05:31.320
But when it comes to the capacity
for brutality, we talk about men.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, I wouldn't disagree.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.520
I was in Afghanistan.
German special forces.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.560
And we had of course
no women in our unit.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.800
We never had it in KSK.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.360
But alas,

05:47.440 --> 05:50.040
we got responsibility
for a female soldier

05:50.120 --> 05:52.680
because she got lost
by her troop from an...

05:53.520 --> 05:56.160
allied so-called "liberal" country.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.840
And on our way back to the base,
we walked into an ambush.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.160
And we were forced to torture a man

06:03.240 --> 06:05.600
to show us an escape route
out of the mountains.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.760
It wasn't something I wanted to do.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.400
But it was him or us.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.920
The woman's behavior in that
situation put us all in grave danger.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.280
Sometimes you have
to be absolutely ruthless.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.280
You don't know anything about me.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.320
I've kept an eye on your writing
since Cato recommended it to me.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.720
You wouldn't even be here if
it weren't for what you've written.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.920
You write about the threat
to our Christian culture.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.840
You say a religious war is coming.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.520
We will be forced to fight,
to be warriors.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.440
So?

06:49.720 --> 06:52.120
Well, I can't see that in you.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.400
Where would this hatred come from?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.400
I had a boyfriend.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.840
I was very much in love.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.360
He was very sure of his opinions.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.160
I admired him.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.720
His strength, but also his head.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.760
And...

07:25.320 --> 07:26.880
like five years ago,

07:26.960 --> 07:30.600
we were going to Gothenburg
to an anti-immigration rally.

07:30.680 --> 07:34.680
And we were going
to this after-party

07:34.760 --> 07:37.520
when we were surrounded
by a gang of Pakis.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.080
And it wasn't so much
what they did to me,

07:43.160 --> 07:45.600
it was more what they did to Lars.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.040
And afterwards...

07:50.240 --> 07:53.240
when Lars was just
lying there, shaking...

07:56.520 --> 07:59.520
When I looked into his eyes,
I knew it was over.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.920
They made him into something else.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.120
And they turned everything
that I believed in

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
into something ridiculous.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.920
And you know what?
Today I'm actually thankful.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.960
Because it made me wake up.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.760
And I think
my writing changed accordingly.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
Where in Gothenburg were you?

08:28.320 --> 08:30.720
We were cutting through
Keillers Park.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.680
Are you familiar with Gothenburg?

08:34.800 --> 08:36.160
Hisingen Island?

08:50.840 --> 08:53.440
We want to do big things.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.640
Things no one can imagine.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.360
To change the world.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.360
Tomorrow...

09:04.800 --> 09:08.200
we must see
you have what it takes.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.960
Hey, what do you say we go
visit Uncle Bjørnar in Oslo?

09:44.120 --> 09:45.680
Why?

09:45.760 --> 09:49.200
You know he loves when we visit.
Especially you.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.800
Yeah, but it's
Linnea's birthday party today.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.360
Right.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.320
I forgot.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.200
How could I forget that?

10:04.400 --> 10:06.800
Why have you packed our bags?

10:09.960 --> 10:11.160
What do you mean?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.120
Our bags.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.160
Why have you packed them?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.200
I was just thinking...

10:18.280 --> 10:20.680
It was in case you wanted
to take a trip.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.880
Eat chips, listen to music
and just drive a little.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.480
You said we were going to stay here.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.040
We are.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.480
No problem.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.640
-It'll be nice. Hello.
<i>-Hi.</i>

10:36.720 --> 10:38.040
Where are you?

10:38.840 --> 10:41.000
At home with my daughter.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.000
Kjetil is dead.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.480
I need you to get down there
and find out what happened.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.240
<i>Yeah, but like I said,</i>
<i>I'm at home with my kid now, alone,</i>

10:52.320 --> 10:55.240
so maybe Ragna could
take care of that?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.360
<i>I can't get a hold of her,</i>
<i>and now this guy turns up dead.</i>

10:58.440 --> 11:00.280
I need you to go down there.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.080
What do you think's going on?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.080
<i>That's what I'm trying to find out.</i>

11:24.600 --> 11:26.400
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.120
I know we're a bit early.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.960
I thought I had lost track
of the time.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.840
No, it's us.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.600
I've got a situation at work,
so if it's okay, it would be...

11:37.680 --> 11:40.960
Hi. Just go up to Linnea.
She's in her room.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.480
I'm sure she'll be glad
for an early visit.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.400
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye. Have fun.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.520
Thank you so much.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.280
Hi.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.880
Hi. Up here you don't need to work
on your days off, you know.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.480
-Right.
-Right.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.120
Do you have any theories?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.840
Well, we can't know for sure,

12:43.920 --> 12:47.840
but it looks like he was drunk
and fell asleep, and then he drowned.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.760
-Weren't you here last night?
-Yeah, I ate dinner here.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.240
We had a few drinks,
and then I went home.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.120
Then one of those rascals sat
and drank with him till...

13:05.200 --> 13:08.280
What time did you pick him up?
Around 12?

13:08.360 --> 13:11.320
-He wanted to keep drinking.
-He was wasted.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.880
So there's no sign
of anyone else being here, then.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.800
No, at least not while I was here.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.040
No.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.080
He was in a bloody dark mood, but...

13:27.200 --> 13:30.200
I don't think he did this on purpose.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.280
I think this is just
a tragic accident.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.600
I just wanted to check.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.720
<i>They're saying he was drunk</i>
<i>and drowned. In a Jacuzzi.</i>

13:58.800 --> 14:00.400
<i>I don't believe that for a second.</i>

14:00.480 --> 14:02.960
<i>And Ole leaving</i>
<i>before his brother is even buried.</i>

14:03.040 --> 14:04.320
Oh, he's left?

14:04.400 --> 14:07.640
Bjørn's wife said they've gone
to France to climb.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.480
Yeah, and Siem is standing there,
lying, calling it an accident,

14:11.560 --> 14:13.400
and then he's going
to write the report.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.720
We'll get back to that
when we're done here.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.400
He leaked my identity.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.920
To journalists in Oslo.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.680
He did that, personally.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.280
We have more
important stuff to deal with.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.680
It may seem a bit vague that we're
being chased by the Russian mob,

14:31.760 --> 14:36.240
but this is completely real to us.
You have read about me, right?

14:36.320 --> 14:38.480
We have been hiding
for three fucking years,

14:38.560 --> 14:41.480
and now I feel...
I honestly feel that...

14:41.560 --> 14:44.760
You feel what?
That you have a corrupt boss?

14:44.840 --> 14:48.040
It's not exactly in the top ten
on my list of priorities right now.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.480
We haven't heard from Ragna.
We don't even know if she's alive.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.840
You don't care about me.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.080
But I don't care about you either.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.080
Trust me.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.800
I care about my daughter.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.240
I only care about my daughter.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.760
I just have to go to the restroom.

16:19.560 --> 16:24.000
I'll have to call you back.
Speak to you soon. Bye.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.640
<i>-Police emergency, how can I help?</i>
-Code 47.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.240
<i>Right. One moment.</i>

16:37.320 --> 16:38.400
-Inger.
<i>-Where are you?</i>

16:38.480 --> 16:39.800
We're heading to Oslo.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.800
Ole killed Kjetil. He drowned him.
There was nothing I could do.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.320
<i>-Is it just you and Ole?</i>
-No, there's another guy.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.040
I don't know his name.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.880
Fuck. He's German,
from East Germany.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.680
Former special forces.
He's been in Afghanistan.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.240
He said something about doing big,
unimaginable things

16:57.320 --> 16:58.760
to change the world.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.680
"That they need to know," he said.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.760
And I don't know if it's in Norway.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.640
Either way, just stay away.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.360
<i>-But Ragna...</i>
-No. No matter what.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.920
Don't do anything until I say so,
or we'll never find Cato.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.840
They also said, "It doesn't matter
if it's an old lady or a red devil."

17:13.920 --> 17:16.160
I didn't understand anything.
I have to go.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.640
<i>She's alive. Pack our stuff.</i>
<i>She's on her way to Oslo.</i>

17:43.640 --> 17:47.040
We didn't know
she was already on the move.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.480
Yes, I'll keep you posted.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.240
She's in control.
This won't be another Gothenburg.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.760
No, but we'll have...

18:29.120 --> 18:32.200
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Can you run a license plate for me?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.120
<i>Sure.</i>

18:33.840 --> 18:34.880
<i>What's the number?</i>

18:34.960 --> 18:40.960
SN 57395.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.720
<i>Ford Transit.</i>
<i>From Oslo Rental Services.</i>

18:45.800 --> 18:47.040
Thanks.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.200
Hi.

19:07.720 --> 19:08.840
Hey, Michelle.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.800
We have to go now.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.360
-Why?
-We'll talk about it later. Come.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.080
-But we haven't even eaten cake yet.
-I'm sorry.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.840
-Do you want a piece of cake to go?
-No, we don't have time.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.440
We have to hurry.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.560
Why did we park here?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.240
Yes, it's a bit weird,
but things are a bit weird now.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.200
Okay.

20:01.600 --> 20:06.800
You know I asked you if we should go
to Oslo, to visit Uncle Bjørnar?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.200
And now we actually have to.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.720
Why?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.720
Are we in trouble?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.320
No.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.360
And you know why?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.040
Because we're smart.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.040
You and me.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.680
I'll go get our bags,
and then we're leaving.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.040
Michelle.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.920
Dad. Dots.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.160
Wait here.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.360
-I just have to leave a message.
-Wait.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.640
I'll be right back.
Don't be scared. It'll be fine.

24:22.280 --> 24:27.360
I've gotten myself one of these,
so now I'll be a supercop too.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.880
I just had to get you out of here.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.000
You'll be fine, Asgeir.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.200
You'll be fine.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.000
Come.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.640
We're going to get a new car.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.360
We'll drive a real police car.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.680
-Why?
-Because it's smart. Come.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.040
Come with me.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.400
This is the target.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.160
Mamoud Ashanti.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.000
<i>Leader of the Youth Labor Party.</i>

26:20.000 --> 26:22.360
<i>He's popular, but edgy.</i>

26:22.440 --> 26:25.880
<i>An idol for those</i>
<i>who support multiculturalism.</i>

26:27.560 --> 26:30.040
<i>Some call him the Red Devil.</i>

26:32.320 --> 26:34.640
<i>Now listen.</i>
<i>This is how we will do it.</i>

26:34.720 --> 26:37.360
DIVERSITY! NOT NAIVETY!

26:37.440 --> 26:40.000
When you get the signal,
you start walking.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.280
You cross Karl Johan,

26:41.360 --> 26:44.840
then all the way
to their rally, here.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.560
You'll make your way
through the crowd in the front.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.480
When Mamoud has finished
his speech,

26:51.560 --> 26:54.320
he'll be walking off stage,
probably at the back,

26:54.400 --> 26:56.320
to head
for the party's headquarter.

26:56.400 --> 27:00.000
We have more shooters in the area,
but if he happens to come your way,

27:00.080 --> 27:01.440
then you shoot him.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.240
Do you have a problem with that?

27:11.320 --> 27:13.280
What will that achieve?

27:14.360 --> 27:17.440
You'll light a match,
and we'll have more matches.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.920
You have to remember we're at war.
He's the enemy.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.600
We have different roles to play.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.080
This is your moment of truth.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.120
Just do as he says.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.400
<i>Right after what happened in Oslo</i>
<i>in the Government Quarter,</i>

28:18.480 --> 28:20.360
<i>there were reports of shooting.</i>

28:20.440 --> 28:25.680
<i>We don't know how many have been</i>
<i>killed by the terrorist at Utøya.</i>

28:25.760 --> 28:29.000
<i>The man was dressed as a policeman</i>
<i>and started shooting.</i>

28:29.080 --> 28:34.280
<i>Five people have</i>
<i>allegedly been shot.</i>

28:41.320 --> 28:42.320
Hello!

28:43.120 --> 28:45.240
Does anyone need help?

28:45.320 --> 28:48.880
<i>A total of 69 people were killed</i>
<i>during the shooting at Utøya.</i>

28:48.960 --> 28:51.640
<i>Most of them young activists.</i>

28:51.720 --> 28:54.080
<i>Ruining the building</i>
<i>that houses the offices of...</i>

28:54.160 --> 28:58.240
<i>It has to be one of the worst terror</i>
<i>attacks in Europe in modern history.</i>

28:59.680 --> 29:03.040
-Are we going to copy him?
-Of course not. He was a moron.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.160
A narcissistic poser.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.000
He also wanted to kill
the leader of the youth party.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.440
But we're not like that.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
We're different.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.080
Listen carefully and follow
all instructions you get.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.800
Be ready if he comes your way.

29:19.880 --> 29:22.160
Remember that we have
more shooters there.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.520
-Are unsure of anything?
-No.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.480
Ever since
our youth party was formed,

29:36.560 --> 29:41.040
the idea that people should help
each other has been our foundation.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.280
Some are sick of the word
and say it's old-fashioned,

29:44.360 --> 29:49.320
but I believe that there's one word
we must never forget: solidarity.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.440
Since we're talking about words...

29:53.520 --> 29:57.760
Last week,
someone called me a red devil.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.240
A so-called journalist from
a so-called respectable medium.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.480
And it sparked a debate.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.120
And the words are repeated
and repeated.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.720
Two words meant to create fear.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.080
Meant to divide.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.880
Some say they're just words.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.520
Others say they wouldn't use
exactly those words.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.600
<i>But we know.</i>

30:24.360 --> 30:26.680
<i>We know that words carry meaning.</i>

30:29.360 --> 30:33.680
<i>You can hear us both.</i>
<i>Don't do anything until you're told.</i>

30:48.120 --> 30:50.760
And I am in position.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.480
And there are people
who are attracted by that,

30:53.560 --> 30:56.280
who think it's something
everyone has to put up with,

30:56.360 --> 31:00.200
and who cultivate everything
in silos and echo chambers.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.120
Why is it always either color

31:03.200 --> 31:06.320
or religion
or both with these people?

31:13.680 --> 31:17.800
You are not alone.
That's not just a comfort.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.840
It's just as much a battle cry.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.960
In the fight for community.

31:25.560 --> 31:30.240
For hope of a better future.
Against those who create fear...

31:30.320 --> 31:33.240
Don't look at Ole. Focus.

31:33.320 --> 31:38.280
...and spread hate against those who
are different, who feel different.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.200
We know better than any
other youth party in the world

31:44.280 --> 31:47.000
that words have consequences.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.960
They can aggravate.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.320
Words can radicalize.
Words can create hate.

31:56.960 --> 32:01.000
A decade has gone
since 77 people were killed...

32:02.920 --> 32:08.040
by a monster created by words
that didn't meet resistance.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.320
Have the words gotten any milder?

32:11.960 --> 32:14.800
Have we seen less
right-wing extremism in our country?

32:16.720 --> 32:19.360
In Europe? In the US?

32:20.920 --> 32:24.560
We can't wait for someone else
to turn this around for us.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.160
We have to do it ourselves.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.320
<i>Get into position.</i>

32:38.160 --> 32:40.720
This election is about fighting
for our words,

32:41.320 --> 32:42.440
not silencing others...

32:57.920 --> 33:00.080
Get out!

33:04.400 --> 33:07.200
<i>Follow the leader. Hurry.</i>

33:10.120 --> 33:13.000
<i>He's getting away.</i>
<i>Everyone hurry. Hurry.</i>

33:18.040 --> 33:21.160
<i>Just follow the leader.</i>
<i>Don't look for others!</i>

33:29.440 --> 33:31.160
<i>Everyone, get closer.</i>

33:32.520 --> 33:33.600
Get closer.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.200
<i>Come on, get closer.</i>

33:37.640 --> 33:39.840
<i>Stop it now, she will be exposed.</i>

33:43.800 --> 33:45.360
<i>Stop now. Abort.</i>

33:45.440 --> 33:46.480
<i>Pull back.</i>

34:01.320 --> 34:04.040
-What happened?
-A smoke grenade went off.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.800
-Do they know who did it?
-No.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.040
They're testing her limits.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.680
-Take it easy.
-What the fuck?

34:55.760 --> 34:58.520
-It was just a test.
-Of what?

34:58.600 --> 35:02.320
After Bjørn, some people were afraid
I was on the police's radar.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.040
But now we know I'm not.
And we got to test you too.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.120
-It was a fucking stupid idea.
-Listen.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.960
We were in control the whole time.

35:10.040 --> 35:13.960
I told you. We're not narcissists.
We're not posers.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.520
Look, take this.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.600
Only use it
to communicate with us.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.720
Do you have a friend
you can stay with tonight? Good.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.320
We'll talk tomorrow. I just have
to clean up at the warehouse.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.680
Excuse me?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.480
I've lost my phone
and my wallet.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.560
Could I borrow
your phone to call my husband?

35:38.640 --> 35:41.640
-Sure, okay.
-Thank you.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.720
Code 47.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.480
I'm on the inside now.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.920
They just wanted to test me.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.560
Do you know more
about what the real target is?

36:26.640 --> 36:29.400
Ole says there are information silos,
so he can't tell me.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.680
But they've said
I'll get to meet Cato,

36:31.760 --> 36:34.280
so once I get close to him,
we're going in.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.920
Can I go home?

36:39.000 --> 36:42.160
I've already set up surveillance
there in case you're being followed.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.120
Thanks.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.680
They'll be happy to see you.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.160
I don't know about that.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.360
They think I've let them down
and fled the country, so...

36:55.680 --> 36:59.480
I'll leave messages in the Furia blog
if I can get a new laptop.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.240
We're finally
going to take them down.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.560
THE GABRIELSEN FAMILY

37:26.320 --> 37:27.320
Who is it?

37:30.640 --> 37:31.600
What...

37:32.240 --> 37:34.880
What the hell
are you doing here, Ellen?

37:34.960 --> 37:41.360
I got a sudden meeting in London,
so I thought I could swing by Oslo.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.960
-Can I come in, or are you just...
-Give me a hug.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.920
Hi.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.920
It's a bit of a mess here.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.520
I think about her too. All the time.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.040
Yes.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.120
Dad hasn't changed anything here.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.040
I agree with him, actually.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.120
And he likes to hang up
all my paintings.

38:31.720 --> 38:35.120
Well, so how's
that business life of yours?

38:35.720 --> 38:38.040
It's fine.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.720
Corporate law.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.400
So that's what you studied law for.

38:43.480 --> 38:48.080
I mean, you had the right ideas.
And you were a bloody good writer.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.600
Don't start complaining
about that again, Dad.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.960
-Come on, help me up.
-Sure.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.720
I'm going down to the water.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.520
Isn't it a bit cold, Dad?

39:09.920 --> 39:12.800
Not in this weather.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.360
Showing off.

39:20.920 --> 39:24.080
Your sister nearly drowned out there.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.480
Do you remember?

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
Yes. We sat here, drinking juice,
and didn't notice a thing.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.920
Then all of a sudden you got up
and sprinted down to the water.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.720
You dived in,
with clothes on and everything.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.080
What do the doctors say?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.480
Vascular dementia.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.400
Soon he won't
remember our names, and... Yeah.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.400
What is it you do in Singapore?
When you don't answer your phone?

40:19.480 --> 40:21.680
I can't talk about it, Tarje.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.960
I'll tell you everything
once it's over. I just...

40:26.480 --> 40:29.960
-That doesn't sound good.
-I'll do this one job, and then...

40:31.160 --> 40:33.560
Then I'll come home and help you.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.920
You've been gone for...

40:38.280 --> 40:39.680
How many years?

40:40.880 --> 40:45.560
And then you're going to come back
when he's in a nursing home?

40:50.400 --> 40:53.640
What kind of life
do you think I wanted?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.440
<i>You should've stayed in Vestvik.</i>

41:15.520 --> 41:19.160
<i>If PST and I were going to help you,</i>
<i>you should have stuck it out.</i>

41:19.240 --> 41:20.480
<i>Then we'd have a deal...</i>

41:20.560 --> 41:24.120
They've been in my fucking house.
That changes everything.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.800
You're going to give me a new life.
End of discussion.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.640
You lied.

41:40.800 --> 41:45.320
I'm so sorry, Michelle.
I'm really sorry.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.280
You have killed someone.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.680
It's going to be okay. I promise.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.160
I'll fix this.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.560
Hi.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.600
You want coffee?

42:28.800 --> 42:29.920
Sure.

42:35.560 --> 42:39.200
I'm just picking up my pastries,
and off we go.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.960
Look.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.480
-A prank?
-Yeah. It worked well.

42:49.960 --> 42:53.720
-I still don't get it.
-No, but you will.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.840
What if they'd caught me?

42:58.560 --> 43:02.680
We would know they were on to us,
and they would've caught me too.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.720
Come on, let's go. Follow my car.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.960
Where are we going?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.560
To change the world, of course.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.080
Bye.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.080
SWEDEN
