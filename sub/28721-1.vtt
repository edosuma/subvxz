05:00.000 --> 05:04.118
Panoramix? Everything good?
-It could not be better.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.118
Panoramix? Everything good?
-It could not be better.

05:04.250 --> 05:08.368
Why are you lying here on the floor?
-I'm meditating.

05:10.875 --> 05:15.244
You are not out yet
fallen a tree?

05:16.583 --> 05:20.030
Fallen from a tree. Asterix.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.249
Come on, Obelix,
we help the druid rise.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.162
Help get up?
Hey guys, leave me alone.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.828
I'm big enough to ...

05:45.625 --> 05:47.490
Children, calm down.

05:47.625 --> 05:52.494
Today, lesson number one:
how do we make a drink that stinks?

05:54.250 --> 05:57.083
Can I taste?
-No, Obelix. You know best ...

05:57.208 --> 06:00.530
that you are in the boiler
when you were little.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.869
Children.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.833
Children, Panoramix will
no teaching today.

06:33.583 --> 06:37.576
What is it?
-A. ..

06:38.833 --> 06:40.664
Light meal.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.659
Light meal.
-I'm not hungry.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.950
Say, Panoramix, this is ridiculous.
If you have fallen ...

06:52.083 --> 06:55.780
just say that.
- Druids don't fall from trees, Asterix.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.580
That is an earth ground.
Don't fall from trees.

06:59.708 --> 07:05.157
And what about stumbling?
That's a bad sign.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.954
How is he now?
Did you fix it again?

07:08.083 --> 07:12.497
All those years no scratch. I have
never sprained my ankle.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.537
Not once.
And then suddenly: crack.

07:16.875 --> 07:21.118
All those years high in the trees.
So much power. So much energy.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.539
But you keep that broken foot there
not like climbing again?

07:25.667 --> 07:29.364
At Toutatis.
Is it you? Do you invite me ...

07:29.458 --> 07:33.997
to Avalondegem, where the apples
grow all year round?

07:34.125 --> 07:36.741
They are talking about apples.
-Apples?

07:36.833 --> 07:39.950
What are you talking about?
I understood the word apples.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.575
Why let's leave
who deaf always listen?

07:43.708 --> 07:46.700
He leaves us no choice.
- Have you heard the deaf?

07:46.792 --> 07:48.874
Everyone has a dip sometimes.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.120
Panoramix, be reasonable.
We don't know you that way.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.957
You're right.
I can't let myself be known.

07:57.083 --> 08:00.871
That's how I like to hear it.
Our druid is old again.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.197
I take matters into my own hands.
-Good.

08:04.292 --> 08:07.864
As long as I'm a druid from the village, I have to
I take my responsibility.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.581
Exactly, well.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.871
A man goes difficult
decisions.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.037
Absolutely. I don't know where he is
left, but bravo.

08:16.167 --> 08:21.036
I can't be the only one anymore
who knows the formula of the potion.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.453
Bravo.
-What?

08:23.583 --> 08:27.747
I am looking for a young successor
to whom I can entrust it.

08:27.833 --> 08:30.540
What?
-From our young Gaulish druids ...

08:30.667 --> 08:34.239
I choose one
to whom I will learn the recipe ...

08:34.375 --> 08:37.082
and the new druid
from the village.

08:37.207 --> 08:39.119
Come on, let's go ...

08:41.832 --> 08:46.748
We are not going to look for a new druid.
- Only because of a fall from a tree?

08:46.875 --> 08:49.332
I will fall from a tree someday.

08:49.458 --> 08:53.155
Panoramix, is this a joke?
-There is no other way.

08:53.250 --> 08:56.117
They are talking about a recipe.
-A recipe?

08:56.208 --> 08:57.414
A recipe with apples?

08:57.542 --> 08:59.533
An apple pie?
-Be silent.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.249
Did you say a recipe now?
-Yes, I said recipe.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.117
Why do they secretly bake apple pie?

09:05.250 --> 09:09.243
Did you really understand?
Are you really not deaf?

09:10.542 --> 09:13.124
I don't beat women.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.491
And certainly not women of the deaf.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.825
Perfect. And you all stay
close together, promised?

09:45.417 --> 09:47.578
And just be careful.

09:50.583 --> 09:56.123
Obelix, my cairn.
- Excuse me, Panoramix.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.913
I walked behind those ...
-Not those wild boars, Obelix.

10:00.042 --> 10:02.875
No?
- My cairn.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.909
Isn't a menhir much stronger?

10:20.792 --> 10:23.283
What a disaster, Obelix.

10:23.417 --> 10:27.114
Entrust the potion
to a young, inexperienced druid.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.453
Who says he will use it well?

10:30.583 --> 10:35.498
If he spreads the formula, that's it
end of the invincible Gauls.

10:35.625 --> 10:39.243
The end
of the invincible Gauls.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.830
Those guys you see playing there,
those are Gauls.

10:46.958 --> 10:50.530
We offer resistance
to the overpowers, right?

10:50.625 --> 10:54.117
And like their children
Gauls want to be ...

10:54.208 --> 10:57.496
they must also be able to defend themselves.

10:57.583 --> 11:01.997
You are absolutely right, Asterix.
My plan is risky.

11:02.083 --> 11:05.405
That is why the best warrior must be
from the village.

11:05.542 --> 11:11.742
0m help me so I don't have the
wrong young, inexperienced druid molar.

11:11.833 --> 11:15.451
Two know more than one.
-I have a question.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.409
Like another druid
make the potion…

11:18.500 --> 11:21.207
I would finally
can you also taste it?

11:22.125 --> 11:24.616
Take me back to my cabin, Obelix.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.498
Potion.

12:33.458 --> 12:36.325
What are you doing here?
comrades?

12:37.792 --> 12:42.616
Wait, wait. Excuse me, but
wild boar is not what it was.

12:42.708 --> 12:47.498
I understand it up to Panoramix,
but then I lost it.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.662
Say it more clearly.

13:00.417 --> 13:04.205
Panoramix, venerable druid,
the villagers and I ...

13:04.333 --> 13:07.405
give you this message
as support and encouragement.

13:07.542 --> 13:11.615
You have a difficult decision
taken and we stand behind you.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.620
Fact is ...
-We have no choice.

13:14.750 --> 13:21.030
You have not asked us for advice,
but that didn't matter.

13:21.125 --> 13:26.665
We are of course behind you.
- Druid, I have a question.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.368
We might
run less risk ...

13:30.458 --> 13:36.203
if you would like someone from the village
learn to make the potion?

13:36.292 --> 13:40.661
A potion is only passing
from druid to druid, Kostunrix.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.864
Would you trust your fish stall ...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.992
to a layman?
-Absolutely not.

13:47.125 --> 13:51.368
A fish shop is much too technical.
That requires precision, experience ...

13:51.500 --> 13:54.116
not only love for the profession ...

13:54.250 --> 13:58.480
but also interest
in the latest developments.

13:58.542 --> 14:03.536
Always focused on the future.
Just sayin…

15:39.542 --> 15:41.783
Panoramix?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.994
Panoramix?

16:00.625 --> 16:03.662
Do we really not have to come along?
-Absolutely.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.913
With your broken foot ...
-It is forbidden.

16:07.042 --> 16:11.035
Druids take the rules seriously.
-Do you only wander?

16:11.125 --> 16:15.073
Isn't that a problem?
-I have no choice. I have to go alone.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.288
Yes, we have a problem.
-Being quiet.

16:34.625 --> 16:35.705
Panoramix.

16:35.833 --> 16:39.155
I should not have hid myself,
but fell asleep.

16:39.292 --> 16:42.204
Before you get angry,
take a look at my model.

16:42.292 --> 16:46.991
Pectin, what are you doing here? We are too far
from the village to bring you back.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.286
They are definitely looking for you.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.491
I told everyone
that she went.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.995
What? Did you know she was in the boiler?

16:54.083 --> 16:56.244
I have seen her crawl into it.
-What?

16:56.375 --> 17:00.573
Why didn't you say anything, owl chick?
-Because she asked.

17:00.708 --> 17:04.280
What did you say to the village?
-Pectin is in the boiler.

17:04.375 --> 17:08.288
Awesome. What now?
The forest is forbidden for women.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.867
I thought for non-druids.
-And for women.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.075
Is it my fault that the druids
prohibit everything?

17:17.208 --> 17:20.325
I may not have a potion, but
do I make a point of that?

17:20.458 --> 17:24.997
You take a little girl with you
without informing me.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.990
Tell me ...

17:27.125 --> 17:31.289
why Mr. Asterix always
need to be aware of everything?

17:36.125 --> 17:37.706
Pectin.

17:38.625 --> 17:44.825
Pectin, come on, you don't have to cry like
you have made such a beautiful model.

17:45.917 --> 17:48.989
Explain to me how it all works.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.577
Can I really come here?
- Rather a child than Asterix and Obelix.

18:00.667 --> 18:04.159
But just try yourself
hide long hair and voice.

18:04.292 --> 18:09.412
Do I have to hide that I am a girl?
- A boy can come here.

18:09.500 --> 18:13.118
And what if they ask me a question?
-Then you answer ...

18:14.625 --> 18:18.322
Exactly.
Watch out, we're here.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.708
Is it normal that nobody is here?
Druid?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.742
No, something is wrong.

19:07.417 --> 19:12.286
Do you realize, Obelix?
The Great Council of Druids.

19:12.375 --> 19:16.038
The best druids of Gaul together.
What a spectacle.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.743
A spectacle?
- Pointing with their white beards.

19:19.833 --> 19:23.746
Scholars, philosophers
that must be very impressive.

19:26.917 --> 19:31.707
Welcome to Panoramix, old man.
-How is it with our star?

19:31.833 --> 19:34.449
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

19:34.542 --> 19:38.740
See what we have made for you.
You can hang this in your forest.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.745
Be careful. Falling druids.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.864
Wait, Vitrokeramix.
Did you not receive my message?

19:46.958 --> 19:50.576
I sent wild boar.
-They said you fell.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.204
Cases? Is that all?
-How so?

19:53.292 --> 19:59.037
Is that not enough?
-And the transfer? The successor?

19:59.125 --> 20:01.616
Which transfer? Which successor?

20:01.750 --> 20:06.198
What are you cooking up,
old buddy? Explain.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.700
Well, we didn't see that coming.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.831
Do you mean that, Panoramix?

20:14.917 --> 20:17.624
What if the potion
falls into the wrong hands?

20:17.708 --> 20:22.202
You understand I don't make this decision
have taken light, Fantasmagorix.

20:22.292 --> 20:24.829
Now I understand why you
summoned the Grand Council.

20:24.958 --> 20:29.452
I thought it was strange that you called us together
to tell you that you had fallen.

20:29.542 --> 20:33.160
I need you for the preselection
of my candidates.

20:33.250 --> 20:37.789
Do you know the list of names of all?
memorize young Gallic druids?

20:38.625 --> 20:42.698
By heart…
We have a database.

20:42.792 --> 20:44.532
Database?

20:44.667 --> 20:47.374
Small tokens.
Classified by level.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.956
Can druids write then?

20:49.083 --> 20:53.873
No, that's forbidden.
"From mouth to ear, from druid to druid."

20:54.000 --> 20:57.447
Panoramix has taught you well.
That is very good.

20:57.542 --> 21:00.500
No writings with the druids.
Everything by heart.

21:00.625 --> 21:05.540
With all those formulas that we need
Remember, our mind is full of stuff.

21:05.625 --> 21:09.914
The list of young, Gallic druids
is on small tokens.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.616
Ignorance is bliss.
-In a tray.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.414
Speech is silver, silence is golden.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.500
Jack cracked, shut up.
- Go get it, men.

21:21.208 --> 21:25.781
Well, you fall from trees,
we make chips.

21:27.208 --> 21:30.655
What do you not understand, Obelix?

21:30.750 --> 21:34.322
Do they all have a white beard?
-All of them…

21:34.417 --> 21:38.035
I think so.
- And how do they do that?

21:40.500 --> 21:45.039
Obelix, when I say they
all have a white beard ...

21:45.125 --> 21:48.913
then each of them has one,
they don't share the same beard.

21:50.333 --> 21:55.578
They all have a white beard.
Not one white beard for everyone.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.198
Those are the very bad ones.

22:02.333 --> 22:05.621
Here the prutsers
who can still do something.

22:05.750 --> 22:09.197
There the good one and there the very good one.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.824
You don't have much work on the very good ones.

22:11.958 --> 22:16.452
These are the greatest idiots.
They can't even make onion soup.

22:16.542 --> 22:21.241
Everyone deserves a chance,
But don't you just want the very good ones?

22:21.333 --> 22:25.246
No one is there with that one
can replace druid like you.

22:25.375 --> 22:30.574
Nobody is irreplaceable.
-I don't agree with that at all.

22:41.542 --> 22:43.407
Sulfurix?

22:43.542 --> 22:46.955
How are the men?
with beards? Ages ago.

22:47.042 --> 22:51.035
Someone already has a potion
invented against rheumatism?

22:51.958 --> 22:56.531
Sulfurix. How dare you appear
at the Sacred Open Place, after all this time?

22:56.667 --> 22:59.784
After all this time you are
maybe a bit smoother.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.624
Smoother?
-Not physically.

23:02.708 --> 23:05.245
You still strain your laughing muscles.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.616
Nobody offers me
to wear a cone?

23:21.833 --> 23:25.405
How dare you forbidden magic
to use here?

23:25.500 --> 23:28.367
You know, that only works
with sensitive spirits.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.742
What have you got against us?
- Against you? Nothing.

23:31.833 --> 23:36.532
I am coming to present myself as a successor.
-Successor? Successor to what?

23:36.625 --> 23:39.867
From the great Panorama mix of course.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.538
You? What a joke.
- You can't even be a druid anymore.

23:43.625 --> 23:48.073
Do you think Panoramix is ​​you
give the formula?

23:50.750 --> 23:54.197
Well then, comrade,
do we fall from trees?

23:54.292 --> 23:56.078
Are we an apricot?

23:59.833 --> 24:04.247
You finally understood that
you are not that special ...

24:04.333 --> 24:07.655
and that you have to pass on the torch.
-Panoramix is ​​the best.

24:07.792 --> 24:11.831
Yours, yes. But everyone said
that I was better than him.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.489
Have you forgotten that?
If I had the potion ...

24:15.583 --> 24:19.371
I wouldn't just be a village
protect mustache idiots.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.076
If we spread that magic power
all over occupied Gaul ...

24:23.167 --> 24:27.536
we can overthrow Rome
and put an end to war.

24:29.583 --> 24:33.531
But the famous Panoramix
chooses a good student ...

24:33.625 --> 24:36.458
that he can mold to his image ...

24:36.542 --> 24:39.204
to make it selfish,
like him.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.331
Backwards.

25:04.333 --> 25:07.325
To be honest,
I didn't really believe in it.

25:10.750 --> 25:15.574
The tokens, men.
- Now they're confused.

25:15.708 --> 25:19.621
Who should I grab by his beard?
Okay, I see him.

26:34.042 --> 26:38.160
That is nonsense
and very interesting.

26:48.375 --> 26:49.956
Here, drink one.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.320
You get used to it quickly.
- Aren't you thirsty?

26:54.958 --> 26:58.655
What a misery.
Sulfurix that suddenly pops up.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.124
After all this time.
-Terrible.

27:01.208 --> 27:05.531
But who is ...
But who is that Sulfurix anyway?

27:05.667 --> 27:10.331
Good that you ask.
I'll tell you a story ...

27:10.458 --> 27:13.495
full of voice effects and tension.

27:13.625 --> 27:19.416
Sulfurix and Panoramix were
two talented young druids.

27:19.542 --> 27:24.411
Always together, always working
develop new techniques.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.830
Sulfurix and Panoramix
were two little geniuses.

27:27.958 --> 27:31.325
I was a big fool.

27:31.417 --> 27:36.491
Atmosferix, you shouldn't say that.
-I almost sent away four times.

27:36.625 --> 27:38.616
Anyway,
at the Great Druid Competition ...

27:38.750 --> 27:43.073
Sulfurix suggested his flame powder
before, that impressed the jury.

27:45.458 --> 27:48.291
Panoramix had taken a risk.

27:48.417 --> 27:52.865
He had chosen magic,
simple and beautiful.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.366
And at Belenos, it was beautiful.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.991
His magic was magnificent,
resourceful.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.495
I dropped my wine cup, really.

28:02.625 --> 28:06.117
The proof of
his control of Druidism.

28:08.292 --> 28:10.499
After a long consultation, the jury decided ...

28:10.625 --> 28:14.618
that they could not do magic
reward that had no practical use.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.913
"Nice but useless"
was their conclusion.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.788
And they gave the first prize to Sulfurix.

28:21.917 --> 28:26.206
Yet Sulfurix did not have the career
what he had hoped for.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.699
His magic came
useful here and there.

28:28.833 --> 28:33.247
Then less and less
and then no more.

28:33.375 --> 28:38.950
Panoramix is ​​the most
respected Gallic druid became…

28:39.042 --> 28:42.114
thanks to his magic potion ...

28:42.208 --> 28:45.871
Sulfurix became increasingly bitter.

28:45.958 --> 28:51.954
He only practiced prohibitions
magic and disappeared until this evening.

28:55.083 --> 29:00.828
But who was that guest? A druid?
Thank you for asking.

29:00.958 --> 29:03.495
I'll tell you a story ...

29:46.167 --> 29:49.125
Is he good, bragger?

30:04.167 --> 30:08.331
O noble Panoramix, honored druid,
it is an honor.

30:08.417 --> 30:11.409
Your counterpart,
our dear druid 'Bazunix ...

30:11.500 --> 30:15.823
will introduce you to his young student
in the hope that he may succeed you.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.828
Panoramix, this is Bitnix.

30:17.917 --> 30:21.159
I don't understand why the colleagues
from the forest recommend him.

30:21.292 --> 30:23.999
If he becomes your successor ...

30:24.125 --> 30:28.698
I am Cleopatra's successor.
Forward champion, let's see.

30:28.792 --> 30:32.284
Yes, I will take something from this bottle first.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.957
Those are nettles
soaked in rainwater.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.371
In the second mixture
have I done so many things ...

30:38.500 --> 30:40.582
I really don't know what anymore.

30:40.667 --> 30:44.205
And now, normally,
if all goes well…

30:46.875 --> 30:50.493
What?
- Well, it's fertilizer for the plants.

30:50.583 --> 30:54.121
No, but if you mix something
and let ferment for a while ...

30:54.250 --> 30:57.242
then you usually get fertilizer, don't you?

30:59.167 --> 31:03.740
Well, Panoramix? Will he become your successor?
You get it as a gift.

31:09.708 --> 31:12.165
Panoramix, my name is Janpatrix.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.539
But in the Woud der Carnuten,
was my nickname Magnetix.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.915
That is not normal.
Wait...

31:23.042 --> 31:26.864
That doesn't count. I'm starting again. Pay attention.

31:34.958 --> 31:37.620
Panoramix, my name is Olivix.

31:37.708 --> 31:42.532
I invented my own brew
inspired by your potion.

31:42.625 --> 31:45.332
Look at this weak, sick man.

31:45.458 --> 31:50.077
The poor man. Drink it, dude.
You really need it.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.414
Fantastic, right?

32:03.042 --> 32:06.489
Don't mind us. We don't want to disturb you.

32:08.792 --> 32:10.908
At Toutatis, what are you doing here?

32:11.000 --> 32:16.074
We are here
to provide our expertise ...

32:16.167 --> 32:18.328
when searching for a successor.

32:18.417 --> 32:21.329
You are crazy.
- It concerns us too.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.784
You will soon be bringing an idiot.
We have enough of those.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.579
Wait, wait. Who guards the village?

32:28.250 --> 32:30.457
As acting head
from our beloved village ...

32:30.583 --> 32:34.952
I would first of all
want to express my pride.

32:40.917 --> 32:46.082
Nobody any more. Are they all gone?
-No, the women ...

32:46.167 --> 32:49.989
children and bard are still there.
All men are gone.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.617
The report was made by spies,
so subject to change.

32:53.708 --> 32:57.656
As I always say, spies ...
-Senator Tomcrus, shut up.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.532
Agreement. What are we doing?

33:00.625 --> 33:06.541
Let the legion the stock potion
destroy. Then we'll see.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.991
What is that…
-Ave Caesar.

33:10.208 --> 33:12.199
An intruder. Watchmen.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.414
Tell me, 0 Caesar ...

33:19.542 --> 33:24.912
I heard you speak about the famous
magic potion that gives super powers.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.662
The formula might be you
to interest?

33:27.750 --> 33:31.413
The magic potion of those idiots?
- I mean that, yes.

33:31.500 --> 33:35.448
Do you have the formula?

33:35.583 --> 33:39.701
Not quite yet.
I still have to go get it ...

33:40.458 --> 33:43.450
I still have to go get it ...

33:43.542 --> 33:46.375
in the mountains in the East.
A formality.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.200
I give you the potion, Caesar.

33:49.333 --> 33:53.201
Then you can end it
to those miserable rebels ...

33:53.292 --> 33:56.409
that has been bothering you and us for so long.

33:56.542 --> 33:59.375
But who says ...
-What is. ..

33:59.500 --> 34:01.912
Excuse me, I'll ask.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.617
Who says you are not a fraud,
Gaul?

34:06.750 --> 34:12.245
Good question. What I wanted to ask ...
- Tomcrus, shut up now.

34:12.375 --> 34:15.538
That's my thing now.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.197
But ... But ...

34:26.792 --> 34:31.411
And what do you want in return
for the potion?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.286
Nothing.
-Nothing?

34:33.375 --> 34:36.947
Or is it. A small piece of land
in Gaul ...

34:37.083 --> 34:42.532
that needs to be refurbished:
the Woud der Carnuten.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.699
Agreement.
I'm tired of walking.

34:46.833 --> 34:51.577
Do I get transportation to the mountains?
A small convoy, something simple ...

34:51.708 --> 34:56.907
Discreet and unobtrusive.
-That's all my thing.

35:04.250 --> 35:07.617
O druid.
I still don't know your name.

35:07.708 --> 35:10.370
I'm a senator
Gaius Frontinius Tomcrus.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.081
I wondered...

35:21.958 --> 35:23.368
Do not panic.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.868
Everyone in line for the
reserve stock of the magic ...

35:30.500 --> 35:34.322
So tired on my mark ...

35:38.750 --> 35:42.117
My mother is ramming your harp through your throat
if you bother.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.415
We have not received a potion.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.703
Attacking my order.

35:48.833 --> 35:50.243
Centurion.
-What?

35:50.333 --> 35:54.531
So we go the reserve stock
destroy magic potion?

35:54.625 --> 35:56.536
Yes, for the hundredth time.

35:56.625 --> 36:00.163
At the first attack
they are not yet in reserve.

36:00.250 --> 36:03.538
No, in principle there is still much.

36:03.625 --> 36:06.947
So it's actually ... as usual?

36:08.292 --> 36:13.491
On my order.
To attack.

36:31.417 --> 36:33.874
To attack.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.833
So now they have
used up their potions?

36:52.917 --> 36:55.829
That's correct.
-Decision, mission successful?

36:55.958 --> 36:57.243
Absolutely.

36:57.375 --> 37:00.617
I really want to say: bravo, everyone.

37:13.625 --> 37:19.120
I understand you're busy,
but it's full moon.

37:19.208 --> 37:22.951
It is still light.
-A druid doesn't work at full moon.

37:23.083 --> 37:27.702
It is not a matter of day or night.
-I have to. Maybe Panoramix is ​​coming.

37:27.792 --> 37:31.785
If he sees that you work at full moon,
he turns around.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.241
We will see that again.

37:35.125 --> 37:38.663
Talent alone is not enough.
There are also rules.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.323
Are you okay?

37:50.417 --> 37:54.660
I'm getting too old to climb trees.

37:54.920 --> 37:59.411
Are you a druid? I do not know you.
-What is that all there?

37:59.542 --> 38:02.158
I prepare myself.
-Upon which?

38:02.250 --> 38:07.290
The large Panoramix is ​​looking for a successor.
-Who? Who is looking for a successor?

38:07.417 --> 38:10.864
Panoramix. The biggest druid that
ever existed.

38:10.958 --> 38:16.407
I do not know. I'd agree first
organize your work table.

38:16.542 --> 38:19.204
My work table?
It is perfectly arranged.

38:19.917 --> 38:23.785
Distilled water must be on the right.
-Why? You are left-handed.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.704
Then everything is wrong.
- Exactly.

38:27.792 --> 38:32.081
My master Zurix has me
always said to do it that way.

38:32.167 --> 38:36.786
Ah, those rules ...
I leave distilled water here.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.116
But...
-Water distilling takes a long time.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.866
River water works great.

38:42.958 --> 38:47.076
You don't manipulate the ingredients,
you work with matter.

38:47.167 --> 38:49.829
Druids are not there to make soup ...

38:49.917 --> 38:54.206
but to paint,
to sing, to illuminate ...

38:54.292 --> 38:57.864
to prove that magic exists.

39:17.208 --> 39:20.996
So centurion,
small question about the potion.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.697
Do they have anything left or is it gone?
What about

39:24.833 --> 39:27.324
Again, I see their stock
not from here.

39:27.458 --> 39:31.201
Yes unfortunately.
-So, by my order ...

39:36.500 --> 39:38.786
They still have some magic potion.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.866
To attack.

39:57.500 --> 40:03.245
I'm Blodimerix, versatile
drove in the service of magic.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.582
Panoramix, I am Tectonix.

40:10.250 --> 40:14.323
Panoramix. I'm Klimatosceptix
and my specialty is ...

40:23.542 --> 40:25.533
To attack.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.371
Panoramix, we are
the Fratellix brothers.

40:37.375 --> 40:42.039
Panoramix, I promise you
will never give up the recipe.

40:42.167 --> 40:43.703
To attack.

40:44.708 --> 40:49.702
Except for tourists
who pay big money for it ...

40:53.875 --> 40:55.991
I'm Platopmijnbuïx.

40:56.125 --> 40:59.322
I'm Syndicalix.
-We are the four Fantastix.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.788
I said, traveling by boat is not smart.

41:21.917 --> 41:26.490
We just have bad luck
that the first candidates were disappointing.

41:27.958 --> 41:31.951
You put the herbs in this,
the distilled water. See?

41:33.625 --> 41:38.039
A folding roof.
And that is for your Golden Pruning knife.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.365
Sorry.

41:41.542 --> 41:45.911
I have no golden pruning knife.
That is why my mixtures fail.

41:46.042 --> 41:49.660
Now you suddenly think
that you are a bloody fool?

41:49.792 --> 41:55.412
I take my chance. Maybe it's okay
then recipe to someone from our village.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.162
A fishmonger can still do well
become druid.

41:58.292 --> 42:01.250
That becomes something with you as a person.

42:01.375 --> 42:06.574
With this I can prune mistletoe, but
also edit the face of a blacksmith.

42:06.708 --> 42:08.164
Hack.

42:08.292 --> 42:12.205
You can't even get a golden pruning knife
make me a fool.

42:12.333 --> 42:16.531
You can get a beating.
- Gentlemen, take it easy.

42:16.625 --> 42:19.992
Do not fight.
- Maybe a drink?

42:20.083 --> 42:22.369
Good wine rejoices a human heart.

42:22.500 --> 42:26.539
That remains to be seen,
but please calm down.

42:27.458 --> 42:31.872
I went too far. If you want to become a druid,
I don't stop you.

42:31.958 --> 42:37.248
You must be right.
It will never be something with my mixtures ...

42:42.292 --> 42:45.489
Bunch of idlers. Do not use anything.

42:45.625 --> 42:50.073
Our efforts disrupted.
- Really, shut up.

43:03.667 --> 43:08.457
I have changed the formula.
He shouldn't explode anymore.

43:12.167 --> 43:15.659
It goes the fishmonger druid
better off, right?

43:15.792 --> 43:18.750
What does your mixture do?
-It doesn't explode.

43:18.875 --> 43:22.697
"Look, Panoramix,
a mixture that does not explode. "

43:22.792 --> 43:26.364
You don't even have a mixture, prutser.

43:26.500 --> 43:30.448
Look at our Heroix.
-Aplusbeïsgelix.

43:30.542 --> 43:33.659
My brother.
Good to see you again, old man.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.991
And everyone is there. How nice.

43:36.125 --> 43:38.366
Bye, men.
Obelix, round and healthy?

43:38.458 --> 43:43.998
Asterix, still skin and bone?
The good old days.

43:44.125 --> 43:47.947
Good old days?
-When we fought against Rome together.

43:48.083 --> 43:53.578
You have not fought much against Rome.
Not good for business, of course.

43:53.667 --> 43:56.283
Asterix, how can you say that?

43:56.417 --> 44:00.911
Yes, it was naive, believing in a good one
rapport with that Roman gear.

44:01.042 --> 44:03.374
I have learned my lesson.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.957
What's in the wild boar sauce?

44:06.083 --> 44:12.079
A plum? Which idiot has plums
put in the sauce? This is not Rome.

44:12.208 --> 44:14.824
No dates and pine nuts?
- They're in there too.

44:14.958 --> 44:19.327
Scandalous. Horrible. Throw
all those cooks for the lions.

44:19.417 --> 44:23.660
Or give them up.
-Can we see that young druid?

44:23.750 --> 44:27.789
I'm telling you, he's a rock with Jupiter.

44:27.917 --> 44:32.035
Toutatis. Colchix, leave Panoramix
but see what you can.

44:32.125 --> 44:36.164
0, large Panoramix.
This is a classic mosaic tile:

44:36.292 --> 44:39.489
the god Mars with his helmet, the
legionary eagle and the olive branch.

44:39.625 --> 44:44.369
Everyone has that at home, but one
single motif becomes a bit boring.

44:44.458 --> 44:46.164
I dip the tile ...

44:47.792 --> 44:49.328
Go ahead, go ahead.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.374
I immerse the tile in this liquid.

44:53.458 --> 44:59.658
Now we see fierce gladiators and the
noble Caesar who grants them grace.

44:59.792 --> 45:03.580
And now he is different again.
Mars. Gladiators. Mars…

45:07.917 --> 45:12.911
Dear Heroix, Asterix, I swear
on Belenos de Schitterende ...

45:13.000 --> 45:16.117
that there is no Gallischer village
then mine exists.

45:30.833 --> 45:32.824
Do it again.

45:46.167 --> 45:50.615
You are not really convinced.
-Yes, it's fine.

45:50.750 --> 45:53.617
But?
- But it's normal.

45:53.708 --> 45:56.871
It is good, without pit.
When Panoramix comes ...

45:56.958 --> 46:01.577
he will not be satisfied with a means
to separate berries.

46:01.667 --> 46:04.033
This is about Panoramix.

46:04.125 --> 46:07.413
Did you not say
that you did not know Panoramix?

46:07.542 --> 46:09.999
Nobody knows him better than I do.

46:10.083 --> 46:15.749
You can win the Big Competition
if you do what I have taught you.

46:15.875 --> 46:19.163
The magic art with the butterflies?
It is useless.

46:19.292 --> 46:22.364
I am not going to use useless magic
show.

46:22.500 --> 46:28.200
You don't know Panoramix at all.
Show the magic art, Teleferix.

46:28.333 --> 46:30.915
Then that potion is yours.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.913
No. I'm going to do my magic
with the berries.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.787
Then it's just normal.

46:37.917 --> 46:43.162
I am not going to show him magic
is not mine. Certainly not useless.

46:43.250 --> 46:45.992
You are a sensible boy,
Teleferix.

46:46.083 --> 46:48.950
Don't let your honesty ruin everything.

47:00.917 --> 47:03.954
That is our last chance.

47:24.875 --> 47:28.993
Too bad, said.
-This is perhaps the least bad one.

47:29.125 --> 47:32.913
You're not gonna tell me ...
-If I train him ...

47:33.042 --> 47:36.205
We are not going to take that guest, are we?

47:36.333 --> 47:39.871
Take it easy. We are not at home here.
-I really like him.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.948
If we have one like that somewhere else
find the same thing with cheese ...

47:44.042 --> 47:48.035
Listen, O traveler.
Listen, o traveling merchant.

47:48.125 --> 47:50.457
Listen to my message.

47:50.542 --> 47:55.206
O traveler.
Whether you are a traveler ...

47:55.292 --> 47:58.204
or just a walker ...
- Stop that babbling.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.032
They have to believe you.

48:00.167 --> 48:03.955
I'm a senator.
This is not really part of my job.

48:04.083 --> 48:08.031
I am not interested in your work.
Make them believe you.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.957
Listen, you who are on the way.

48:12.083 --> 48:16.747
Listen to the young prophet
who is a victim of his success.

48:18.583 --> 48:23.998
A little less with those birds.
What do the gods tell us? What?

48:24.125 --> 48:27.822
What did you say? 'A kicking hybrid
stiffen among the dwarfs'?

48:27.958 --> 48:30.040
No, I don't hear well.

48:30.167 --> 48:33.705
My left ear is definitely inflamed. What to?

48:33.833 --> 48:36.745
"A brave druid."
staying here in the mountains'?

48:36.875 --> 48:39.082
Gods, what are you telling us now?

48:39.208 --> 48:44.953
An unprecedented talent
young druid Up there on the mountain?

48:45.083 --> 48:49.247
I know enough, O Gods. I
will now magically disappear.

48:54.625 --> 48:58.163
What kind of an idiot was that?
Is it from here?

48:58.292 --> 49:01.489
He talked about a young druid, right?

49:01.625 --> 49:06.540
You don't believe him, do you? We have
no more chips, it's done.

49:06.667 --> 49:09.625
Unfortunately no replacement.
-I'm not interested in those tokens.

49:09.750 --> 49:12.241
A druid lives in the mountains.

49:12.375 --> 49:13.956
That is Teleferix.
-Excuse me?

49:14.042 --> 49:17.910
That old fool was probably talking about Teleferix.

49:18.042 --> 49:22.365
Does he have a good reputation?
-Yes, he's not bad.

49:22.458 --> 49:26.155
But multiply sandwiches,
I can do that alone.

49:26.292 --> 49:31.491
You are clearly irreplaceable.
-Absolutely. We are going home.

49:31.625 --> 49:34.947
Only when I've seen the last druid.

49:35.083 --> 49:40.783
How is that possible? We are all over Gaul
been with those stupid chips.

49:40.917 --> 49:43.374
In vain.
Don't get angry.

49:43.458 --> 49:47.497
I'm not mad.
I will also stumble.

49:47.583 --> 49:52.373
I almost fell.
Well, this is my successor.

49:52.458 --> 49:55.621
The new best warrior in the village.

49:55.708 --> 50:00.031
Sword, helmet, potion ...
Have fun with it.

50:00.125 --> 50:06.280
I am gone. I'm fed up with it
with all those stiff heads here.

50:06.417 --> 50:10.205
Obelix, are you coming?
-No, Mr. Asterix, I'm not coming.

50:10.292 --> 50:13.864
Not if you are an old man
if you choose a replacement ...

50:14.000 --> 50:19.199
instead of your so-called best
friend. Good trip, Mr. Asterix.

50:22.542 --> 50:26.911
Asterix. Asterix. Don't be faint now.
Panoramix ...

50:27.042 --> 50:30.660
Do something please.
-Asterix is ​​free to go.

50:30.750 --> 50:36.825
I have to complete my mission.
If necessary, I only go into the mountains.

50:47.083 --> 50:51.452
Do you not notice anything?
-No, I never come here.

50:51.583 --> 50:54.290
I can never participate.
- Look around.

50:54.417 --> 50:57.830
It is a bit dusty
but I have not furnished it.

51:00.667 --> 51:03.283
There is no longer a drop of magic potion.

51:03.417 --> 51:07.285
And since you are village chief ...
-Really?

51:07.417 --> 51:11.080
As the village head you have to tell us
what we have to do.

51:14.292 --> 51:19.286
Well, I think as a village chief
that there is nothing else to it ...

51:19.417 --> 51:22.909
then hope the
No longer attacking Romans.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.909
Is that good? Or not?

51:48.208 --> 51:50.199
Come on, let's break up the camp.

51:50.333 --> 51:53.951
And be quiet. When they see us,
everything falls into the water.

51:54.042 --> 51:57.910
What inspires me
to entrust you with this task?

51:58.000 --> 52:02.494
Had someone else chosen.
-If the Gauls stay away ...

52:02.625 --> 52:07.699
Why? My explanation was clear.
-If it fails, I tell Caesar.

52:07.792 --> 52:12.616
Then I tell Caesar that you are one
rude, mean, bearded villain ...

52:13.917 --> 52:15.373
Come on, break up the camp.

52:16.583 --> 52:21.156
What do we have here?
A Gallic warrior.

52:21.292 --> 52:24.864
What kind of a dirty area is this, Sulfurix?
-Dirty area?

52:24.958 --> 52:30.908
I'm an old friend of Panoramix
trying to help him.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.707
You want to sell the formula
to the Romans.

52:33.833 --> 52:36.165
Well, the Romans are rich.

52:36.250 --> 52:40.493
I want as many people as possible
take advantage of the potion.

52:40.583 --> 52:42.744
Then everyone is equally strong.

52:42.875 --> 52:47.448
I'm a peaceful man, Asterix.
-You are the worst of all druids.

52:47.542 --> 52:49.828
No. There is one that is even worse.

52:49.958 --> 52:54.488
He saves his knowledge for one
handful of stupid fighters ...

52:54.833 --> 52:57.449
while he can redeem all his people
from Rome.

52:57.583 --> 53:02.122
Ridiculous. What if Jan and everyone else
will he have a potion?

53:02.250 --> 53:04.992
Be happy, we'll know soon.

53:08.958 --> 53:14.498
... who is kicking me out while I'm a senator
am. That is more than a druid.

53:14.625 --> 53:17.241
What is the Gaul doing here?
- Your men must hurry.

53:17.375 --> 53:21.072
Break up the camp
and tie that Gaul.

53:21.167 --> 53:23.499
Otherwise he warns the rest.

53:38.667 --> 53:41.249
I said you
should not disturb me.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.037
I pour this in here.
- Give it up anyway.

53:56.167 --> 53:58.874
It doesn't work anyway.
- I changed it.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.288
I pour this in here
and then I count to ten.

54:02.417 --> 54:05.909
If it hasn't exploded then it's okay.

54:06.042 --> 54:07.327
Ready?

54:09.042 --> 54:10.157
A...

54:17.042 --> 54:20.455
You have the ranking
of your work table reversed?

54:20.583 --> 54:22.073
I'm left-handed.

54:22.208 --> 54:25.871
Then cross your arms. You are
not the first left-handed druid.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.740
Go ahead, Teleferix.

54:30.750 --> 54:35.369
Show the magic art, Teleferix.
Then the potion is yours.

54:51.750 --> 54:54.867
Where is he now
are you all busy?

55:15.667 --> 55:19.034
I don't want to scare you,
but I think you have competition.

55:20.625 --> 55:26.951
I don't know.
It's nice, but what's the use of it?

55:27.083 --> 55:30.120
Nothing. Nothing at all.

55:40.792 --> 55:44.034
Teleferix, do you want to become my successor?

55:49.333 --> 55:50.823
Yes.

55:50.958 --> 55:55.998
On to the Woud der Carnuten,
where you can reach the next Blue Moon ...

55:56.125 --> 56:00.869
takes note of the formula for the
magic potion that provides super power.

56:02.917 --> 56:05.750
It does have something to be the owner.

56:05.875 --> 56:08.833
Caesar still has to get his magic potion.

56:08.958 --> 56:11.040
A formality.
-That doesn't take away ...

56:11.167 --> 56:14.125
Look at that. Druids are allowed
don't actually write.

56:14.250 --> 56:19.415
Then why is it hanging here?
a flashy sign at the entrance?

56:19.500 --> 56:23.163
No idea.
-And their cairns. Making piles.

56:23.292 --> 56:26.159
They can.
Bunch of hypocrites.

56:26.292 --> 56:29.580
Say, you're on fire.
-At Belenos.

56:29.708 --> 56:32.370
I am crazy about those hypocritical druids.

56:32.500 --> 56:37.290
Give it a hand.
- Pull out the cloak. Pull out.

56:46.208 --> 56:49.120
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.
What now?

56:49.250 --> 56:52.413
Nothing to do about it.
-The successor. The formula.

56:52.542 --> 56:57.036
Wouldn't that happen here?
Without a forest your plan will fail.

56:57.167 --> 57:00.534
What a spectacle.
I didn't know what to do ...

57:00.667 --> 57:05.115
with that cursed forest.
You are a genius, Tomcrus.

57:05.250 --> 57:06.831
A genius.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.743
We have said so
that you have to stop messing around.

57:53.833 --> 57:56.745
How do you get it ready?
-My drink hasn't exploded ...

57:56.833 --> 58:00.496
so I drank it.
I was not allowed to miss that opportunity.

58:00.583 --> 58:02.699
This is better than explosions.

58:02.833 --> 58:08.078
Absurd, a fishmonger on a cord.
- You don't have to drag him along.

58:08.208 --> 58:09.948
The Woud der Carnuten.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.828
At Toutatis.

58:31.625 --> 58:34.822
Panoramix,
how should that be with the transfer?

58:34.917 --> 58:39.661
The next Blue Moon is about one
couple of hours. We can't miss that.

59:08.167 --> 59:10.579
The cairn.
-The what?

59:10.667 --> 59:14.285
Rebuild that cairn.
-At once?

59:22.708 --> 59:25.745
And now?
-That's all.

59:25.833 --> 59:28.620
Everything?
-I told you everything.

59:28.708 --> 59:32.030
Panoramix. I have
have never seen such wild boar.

59:32.167 --> 59:36.706
Instead of walking away, they come
at me and they continue to grunt.

59:39.083 --> 59:40.664
Quick, Obelix. Walk.

59:40.750 --> 59:43.617
Walk to the village.
-What is it? What is happening?

59:43.750 --> 59:45.832
Walk.

59:45.958 --> 59:48.244
But? And we?
What are we doing?

59:48.833 --> 59:51.449
Who still has magic potion?

59:54.917 --> 59:58.239
Turn me around.
I can't follow it all.

59:58.750 --> 01:00:01.367
Poor sheep. Is it better that way?

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:13.619
What a disaster.
Now we are never in the village on time.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.947
Obelix. Under those trees, there.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.991
Obelix. Walk past those bushes.

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:29.324
Those are the ingredients
for the potion.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.662
The village.
-If the wild boars just grunt ...

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:44.124
then there is no drop of magic potion
more in the village.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:48.949
Quick, Obelix. The beech in it.
You can rattle all the Romans.

01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.247
Obelix?

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.574
Obelix? Obelix?
-What does he have?

01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:58.825
And the bag? Where is the
bag of ingredients?

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:10.655
I have to go to my cabin
to make a potion.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.823
My pruning knife, where is my pruning knife,
at Toutatis? There is...

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:18.198
Panoramix.

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:36.116
Good evening, children.

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.165
Do not panic.

01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:53.370
Okay then,
a little panic is justified.

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:58.364
All right. Is there really no more magic potion?

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:04.780
Stay here.
-We'll go with you.

01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:07.582
Far too dangerous.
But you are very brave.

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:10.033
One day you say to a kid ...

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:13.989
that he must hide,
and you will defy the enemy.

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:16.369
Stop that nonsense.

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:22.120
He is not doing so badly yet.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.322
Yes, but it could be better.
-It's a start.

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.164
A mini start.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.661
They don't come out.
-What to?

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:36.494
The witches don't come out.
-The potion is used up. The plan works.

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:39.120
So the sustainer really wins?

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:44.165
We can finally give Caesar the good
bring news. Mars forward.

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:53.041
Don't you think this is the moment,
Teleferix?

01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:54.914
The moment?
-Do you know him?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.670
A kettle, the ingredients,
a village in danger.

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:03.456
You're not going to make the potion, are you?
-Panoramix did not instruct me.

01:03:03.542 --> 01:03:08.662
If you have the formula, you must
use that. This is force majeure.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.243
Don't do it.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.162
What kind of mess is this here?

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:30.658
We discuss which strategy
is the best.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:35.035
A strategy?
You just muddy.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:39.698
You would make something together.
-We don't agree.

01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:44.372
I'm the oldest. I said we
have to make a powder that blinds.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.867
That's stupid. Half of us are already blind.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.366
We have to make a speed drink.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.494
And what are you going to do with that, Grandpa?
-What I normally do, just faster.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.490
You mean, thumbs turning?

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:01.280
I'm the only one with a smart plan.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:06.039
A magnifying drink.
Extensively tested. Hand it out.

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:11.118
Now it's enough.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.990
My ingredients.

01:04:14.042 --> 01:04:18.331
My ingredients. How do
I make my potion now?

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.911
No, Teleferix. Do not.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.948
I have to save the village.
- Quiet girl. I'm almost done here.

01:04:41.042 --> 01:04:44.364
Very interesting, that formula.
And that simple.

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:50.158
I would almost dare say something
fog, one last ingredient.

01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:53.364
The last ingredient.
-What last ingredient?

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.690
The final ingredient of the potion.
-But that's really all.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.449
How can you not know that Panoramix
add the most important thing last?

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:05.494
Don't know the formula?

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:09.872
Idiot. He didn't trust you.
Panoramix has certainly picked it.

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:12.574
What have you not used yet?

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:17.122
Maybe this is it? Or else that?
Yes, it must be.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.866
With Toutatis, it must be in this.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:25.365
What a fool in his curse
could have stopped a potion?

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:33.830
You have sabotaged everything.
You are a traitor.

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.832
Are you gonna drink that?
-Shut up.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:06.414
Interesting.

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.619
Very interesting.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.866
Take cover.
- Yes, head Cakofonix.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.537
What are you waiting for?

01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:51.074
Where does that come from?
-They don't aim at us.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.280
Then it's okay.
-They do us a favor.

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:57.329
Don't shoot, he's on our side.
-Who is that again?

01:06:57.417 --> 01:07:02.707
Senator Gaius Frontinius Tomcrus. Do it
open centurion. Caesar's order.

01:07:02.792 --> 01:07:05.249
Focus the attack on the village.

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:08.200
And give me some light.
I will soon break my legs.

01:07:08.292 --> 01:07:11.159
No more wars.

01:07:12.167 --> 01:07:15.785
That is the real usefulness of the
magic potion of that old monkey.

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:19.114
Sulfurix, to your power
now comes to an end.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:27.495
It is over with that mustache village
idiots. Done with Asterix, with…

01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:31.532
What is that?

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:53.869
Soldiers. Shooting at ...

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.583
Shoot the chickens.

01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:26.207
Stop attacking, idiots.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:29.496
Now that your potion has run out? Are you kidding?

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:34.620
And what will you do about it?

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:38.117
Something's not right here.
He's on our side.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.662
He has no reason
to attack us.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.956
Panoramix.

01:08:58.587 --> 01:09:01.370
I have taken
what was left.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.243
Horrible. Teleferix has the magic potion
made where Sulfurix was present.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.787
Pull back. To the beach.
That's an order.

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:14.412
Say, we can do it
retire with you?

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:28.113
Does Teleferix really have the potion
made? Did you see that?

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:32.743
Then you will make it now. Think carefully
and do everything in the same order.

01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:34.456
I never succeed.

01:09:34.582 --> 01:09:39.247
Finally, add a drop here
without anyone seeing it.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.662
And what about you?
- Everyone has to leave here.

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.979
Take Pectin to the beach.
-And you?

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:50.658
Makes you get away. At Toutatis.

01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:02.239
It's not going fast enough.
-The village burns down.

01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:04.623
That is…

01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:11.660
Do you really not need any help?
We brew more often.

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:14.784
Also the magic potion?
- Not that, no.

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.197
Centurion,
should we help them extinguish?

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:22.619
No, we cannot do that.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:27.164
So we are not attacking?
-No, we can't do that.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:33.369
Are you not running anymore, old man? Do you dare it?
finally take on me?

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.290
I don't intend to.
- Can you still do that?

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:44.748
You have a little stir in soup there
you use famous talents for?

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:48.875
That's why you want a successor so badly.

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:56.955
You are blunted
by always making the same soup.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.616
Now you can do nothing else.

01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:05.578
Maybe you are
deliberately jumped out of that tree.

01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:10.449
You are no longer a druid.

01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:32.118
Obelix.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.163
My beautiful village. No village chief
should experience something like that.

01:11:47.292 --> 01:11:51.160
We need magic potion.
-I'm trying my best.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:55.119
Pectin. Can I help you?

01:11:56.292 --> 01:11:59.784
Stay here, boy.
Stay with the champions.

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:05.659
You would be charmed
from my student from the Alps.

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:08.625
A quitter without fantasy,
like you.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:12.743
Too bad you didn't trust him.
Was he too stupid?

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:14.448
He looked too much like his master.

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:18.831
He is not a worthy successor.
That's nobody.

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:21.995
I'm the only one, Panoramix.
You know that.

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:25.083
Give me the last ingredient
and I will spare everyone.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:27.870
Gauls, Romans and even you.

01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:33.239
Sulfurix, I disappear
preferably together with my formula ...

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:35.161
then I give it to you.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:40.539
All right.

01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:18.494
The potion is ready.

01:13:18.625 --> 01:13:21.662
Girl, now we can
maybe help.

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:31.990
Panoramix. Everything fine?
-It could not be better.

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:22.366
And? My brew works well.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.116
Attack.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:37.244
It's up to you. Come on.

01:14:37.333 --> 01:14:40.370
Come on. Drink.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.787
Very nice, but it's useless.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:34.746
Have you been drinking the potion?
-Not so much.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.164
What is that?

01:16:47.542 --> 01:16:49.157
Very nice…

01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:53.697
Now we will see
whether it is useless.

01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:05.873
Men, view this brand new one
ship, the sign of a new start.

01:18:05.958 --> 01:18:09.280
Many may have thought:
that never comes ...

01:18:13.917 --> 01:18:18.741
The potion works for a long time.
- It won't last, Roman.

01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:22.493
He works fairly long with me,
but then ... Finito.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:26.787
He still works.
-Cubitus, take it easy.

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:28.911
Did you have something, fat guy?

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:33.490
Now you don't have much talk anymore,
wild boar.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:38.745
Come on if you dare.
Now it's over.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:42.121
I thought I could go on for a while.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.287
Time to go home.

01:18:57.708 --> 01:19:00.165
You are not a bad boy, Teleferix.

01:19:00.292 --> 01:19:04.535
But if I were you
I would start from the beginning.

01:19:16.792 --> 01:19:19.784
No, I don't have the potion,
O Caesar ...

01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:22.665
and I have not seen that druid anymore.
And the village ...

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:27.035
That's really a shame,
because it didn't matter ...

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:30.492
Anyway, in the end they have
the potion still.

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:35.699
They are unbeatable ...
But you now know that.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:44.701
The responsibility of one
village chief, which is huge.

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:49.991
Fortunately I could still trust
on my experience as an artist.

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:54.289
We usually hit him anyway
just out west, huh?

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:57.079
How does that work?
- That made Pectin.

01:19:57.208 --> 01:20:02.657
That way I can bring in my husband without it
that the cord drags over the ground.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:08.246
Panoramix. Our fellow villagers
and I want to tell you ...

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:10.665
that we are worth nothing
without the potion ...

01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:13.784
and the potion
nothing is worth without you.

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:17.450
My very best Heroix,
best friends...

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:21.956
the potion and me
are worth nothing without you.

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:30.914
Why so sorry, Pectin?
-I can't forget him.

01:20:31.042 --> 01:20:33.829
What?
-The formula of the potion.

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:36.244
I try, but it doesn't work.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:38.915
Are you trying very hard?
-Really.

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:41.829
I know I can't remember him.

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:44.791
It's way too dangerous.
Only you may know him.

01:20:44.917 --> 01:20:49.866
Don't worry, Pectin.
You will eventually forget him.

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:51.619
Sure?
-Yes.

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.618
Or not.

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:04.657
Worked out.
