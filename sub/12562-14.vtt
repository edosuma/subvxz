00:06.902 --> 00:08.269
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:08.271 --> 00:10.671
To the future Mrs. Evan R. Lawson

00:10.673 --> 00:13.107
and the future Mr. Paige Collins.

00:13.109 --> 00:14.575
And next date, no helmets.

00:14.577 --> 00:16.110
There's not going to be a next date.

00:16.111 --> 00:18.012
I am... looking for a game tomorrow.

00:18.014 --> 00:19.246
Are you interested?

00:19.248 --> 00:22.183
If we're clear... it's golf...

00:22.185 --> 00:24.885
- Not a date.
- Did I say date?

00:24.887 --> 00:26.821
- I got your blood results back.
- Uh-huh.

00:26.823 --> 00:29.657
The anti-DNA test came back
positive for lupus.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.959
In your profession,
positive is a negative thing.

00:31.961 --> 00:34.028
Jack, we can fight this together.

00:34.030 --> 00:35.963
Okay, well, we can
fight it together later.

00:35.965 --> 00:37.998
I've got a lesson.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.367
Jack's protein's up past three.

00:40.369 --> 00:42.903
His lupus is more advanced
than we thought.

00:42.905 --> 00:44.071
It's attacking his kidneys.

00:49.044 --> 00:52.346
- Want to grab a bite after?
- Uh...

00:52.348 --> 00:54.248
Yeah. Sure.

00:56.384 --> 00:58.686
And, by the way, you're fired.

00:58.688 --> 01:01.522
You're resorting to distracting me?

01:01.524 --> 01:04.257
I must be getting better.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.026
You're serious.

01:06.028 --> 01:08.429
Yes. Look, you know what?

01:08.431 --> 01:10.331
Don't take it personally, okay?

01:10.333 --> 01:11.632
You know, you're the one who insisted

01:11.634 --> 01:13.000
"oh, I got to go see a nephrologist!"

01:13.002 --> 01:15.636
So I did, but my insurance
won't cover two GPS.

01:15.638 --> 01:17.004
That's why I haven't been getting

01:17.006 --> 01:18.773
any new reports from Dr. Greene.

01:18.775 --> 01:20.541
Yes. By the way, she's... she's great.

01:20.543 --> 01:22.209
She's kind.

01:22.211 --> 01:24.745
She's thorough.
Basically she's you in a dress.

01:24.747 --> 01:27.448
- I'm seeing her tomorrow morning.
- Ye-ah!

01:27.450 --> 01:28.549
Hello!

01:28.551 --> 01:31.152
You know, I'm sorry, but you, uh,

01:31.154 --> 01:32.753
you kind of screwed yourself

01:32.755 --> 01:34.555
out of a job there, Panky.

01:34.557 --> 01:36.290
Look, I don't care about billing, and...

01:36.292 --> 01:37.625
I want to stay in the loop. I mean,

01:37.627 --> 01:40.127
you need to keep me on
as a medical caddy, you know?

01:40.129 --> 01:42.530
To give a second opinion
when challenges come up.

01:42.532 --> 01:44.799
I think it's cute
that you use a golf term

01:44.801 --> 01:46.167
to try to persuade me.

01:46.169 --> 01:47.268
I'm trying to get you
to take your health

01:47.270 --> 01:48.936
as seriously as your golf game.

01:48.938 --> 01:51.205
Mm-hmm. Yoo-hoo-hoo!

01:51.207 --> 01:53.340
Yeah, doh, whoa! Look out!

01:53.342 --> 01:55.943
You know as fascinating as my
creatinine levels might be,

01:55.945 --> 01:57.645
I don't feel the need
to discuss them twice.

01:57.647 --> 02:00.447
You said you wanted to be my friend.

02:00.449 --> 02:02.750
Be my friend.

02:02.752 --> 02:05.085
You know how to be a friend,
don't you, doc?

02:07.489 --> 02:10.424
For you, Jackie boy,

02:10.425 --> 02:13.260
I'll give it a shot.

02:13.262 --> 02:15.296
Hello.

02:15.298 --> 02:17.164
Oh...

02:17.166 --> 02:19.934
- Is everything okay?
- Better than okay.

02:19.936 --> 02:22.469
Because the bluefin tuna

02:22.471 --> 02:24.738
are running off of Grant's Island.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.307
Want to go fishing tomorrow morning?

02:26.309 --> 02:28.042
Uh, didn't you just say
you have an appointment

02:28.044 --> 02:29.777
with Dr. Greene tomorrow morning?

02:29.779 --> 02:31.512
Yeah, right.

02:31.514 --> 02:33.180
Well, maybe the tuna
will hang around for a while.

02:33.182 --> 02:36.750
Wow, you know even less about
fishing than you do about golf.

02:40.856 --> 02:43.991
"After a 15-year absence
from the stage,"

02:43.993 --> 02:47.228
"Gleason is now engaging
in a surprisingly modest,"

02:47.230 --> 02:50.998
"if not feeble attempt
to rehabilitate himself"

02:51.000 --> 02:52.633
"with a return to the theater as bottom"

02:52.635 --> 02:55.469
"in the up-and-coming
Hamptons theatre festival's"

02:55.471 --> 02:57.271
"production of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>"

02:57.273 --> 03:01.208
"Will it spotlight Gleason,
the poet we once admired,"

03:01.210 --> 03:04.645
"or show us more of the
Hollywood lunatic and lover"

03:04.647 --> 03:08.549
"we've sadly come to expect?"

03:08.551 --> 03:13.254
Bottoms up, K. J. Golan.

03:20.328 --> 03:23.163
It's... it's a real honor and a thrill

03:23.165 --> 03:27.668
to have you with us, Mr. Gleason.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.970
Lovely to meet you.

03:29.972 --> 03:32.473
Yes, do please... you call me Gabe.

03:32.475 --> 03:34.441
I'm so excited to be directing here.

03:34.443 --> 03:36.010
- This way. This...
- Okay.

03:36.012 --> 03:37.878
Um, I grew up in the Hamptons,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.179
so I jumped at the chance to help

03:39.181 --> 03:40.481
put this festival on the map.

03:40.483 --> 03:41.882
Oh, watch out, Williamstown.

03:43.319 --> 03:44.718
Yes, Mr. Gleason has arrived.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.521
We will have his costume fitting
right after we finish rehearsal.

03:47.523 --> 03:49.924
Once the community caught wind
that you were performing here,

03:49.926 --> 03:51.458
we sold out in a day.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.061
Oh, well, I'm sure they're
equally thrilled to see you.

03:54.063 --> 03:56.597
I heard you made
quite a splash at La Jolla.

03:56.599 --> 03:59.199
Not... many directors act...

03:59.201 --> 04:01.535
- at least not well.
- Am I walking too fast?

04:01.537 --> 04:03.170
Not at all. I like moving quickly.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.105
Well, since we open tomorrow
night, we're counting on it.

04:05.107 --> 04:07.875
Oh, yes, I'm so sorry, again,
about my late entrance.

04:07.877 --> 04:09.810
My film shoot went over.

04:09.812 --> 04:11.879
Oh, I'm not worried.
You've played the role before.

04:11.881 --> 04:14.615
Nevertheless,
I shall be at your service.

04:16.885 --> 04:18.552
If there's anything else you need,

04:18.553 --> 04:20.087
please don't hesitate to ask me.

04:20.089 --> 04:23.223
This good-luck charm is all I need.

04:23.225 --> 04:25.893
After all your success,
you're still superstitious.

04:25.895 --> 04:27.928
Aren't we all?

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:41.076 --> 04:44.044
Can you please, please, please, please

04:44.046 --> 04:46.013
just take a break so we can go to lunch?

04:46.015 --> 04:47.982
Come on, I'm starving.

04:47.984 --> 04:50.284
I'm... [Groans] I can... I can...
literally, I can feel

04:50.286 --> 04:51.518
my blood sugar dropping.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.721
Sorry, I just... I need to finish this.

04:53.723 --> 04:56.390
Besides, I thought the actors
only got a 30-minute break.

04:56.392 --> 04:58.158
We couldn't even go anywhere.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.593
Paige, I have one line
at the end of the play.

04:59.595 --> 05:01.729
And it's a three-hour play.
Come on, let's go.

05:01.731 --> 05:03.964
- Come on.
- Evan, I... I'm sorry,

05:03.966 --> 05:05.799
I just, look,

05:05.801 --> 05:08.669
I've been painting sets here
every summer for years.

05:08.671 --> 05:10.404
But this time it's different.

05:10.406 --> 05:12.740
I have a chance to impress Julie Sharp.

05:12.742 --> 05:14.775
She's a Parsons alum.

05:14.777 --> 05:16.143
A letter of rec from her

05:16.145 --> 05:18.245
would really help my application.

05:18.247 --> 05:20.147
I get it. I get it.

05:20.149 --> 05:21.348
Good luck.

05:21.350 --> 05:24.051
Evan, you can't say that
in the theater!

05:24.053 --> 05:25.619
"Good luck" is bad luck.

05:25.621 --> 05:27.721
- You have to say "break a leg."
- Okay!

05:27.723 --> 05:29.023
I'm sorry, it was a slip.

05:29.025 --> 05:33.527
It's not like I said <i>MacBeth.</i> I'm...

05:33.529 --> 05:34.695
You just said <i>MacBeth.</i>

05:34.697 --> 05:37.498
Okay, stop. Stop!

05:37.500 --> 05:38.832
We have to go outside,

05:38.834 --> 05:40.100
turn around three times, and spit.

05:40.102 --> 05:42.903
Paige, we are outside.

05:42.905 --> 05:44.405
I get dizzy easily. And technically,

05:44.407 --> 05:46.140
I think we have
to turn around nine times.

05:46.142 --> 05:47.908
It's just a superstition. Come on.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.543
It's, uh... it's... oh, I said <i>MacBeth!</i>

05:49.545 --> 05:52.379
<i>MacBeth, MacBe... </i> it's...
I cursed the show!

05:52.381 --> 05:54.481
I said <i>"MacBeth!"</i> It's ridiculous.

05:54.483 --> 05:56.617
Help! We have an emergency.
Call a doctor!

06:21.033 --> 06:24.033

06:27.109 --> 06:29.343
We were just about to start
rehearsal when she

06:29.345 --> 06:30.444
- passed out.
- I just got light-headed.

06:30.446 --> 06:32.112
Did you hit your head when you fell?

06:32.114 --> 06:34.982
- No.
- Bp is 110 over 70.

06:34.984 --> 06:36.116
Which is normal.

06:36.118 --> 06:38.051
Look, I'm fine now.

06:38.053 --> 06:40.921
Whoa. Wh... okay, okay.

06:40.923 --> 06:42.256
Okay, easy.

06:42.258 --> 06:44.024
Easy. Here we go.

06:44.026 --> 06:46.326
Divya, would you give me a scalpel?

06:46.328 --> 06:48.462
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

06:48.464 --> 06:49.763
Dude, what are you going to do to her?

06:49.765 --> 06:53.433
- Thank you.
- What...

06:59.975 --> 07:01.441
Julie, can you grab me a shirt, please?

07:01.443 --> 07:02.976
Deep breaths, that's it.

07:02.978 --> 07:05.312
Slowly come up. Here we go.

07:05.314 --> 07:08.148
- Here.
- Your corset was laced so tight

07:08.150 --> 07:10.017
that you became anxious and then started

07:10.019 --> 07:12.119
to hyperventilate, causing you to faint.

07:12.121 --> 07:14.688
Yeah, maybe next time
you just go with spanx.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.923
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Of course.

07:16.925 --> 07:18.292
Just take a few minutes.

07:18.294 --> 07:20.294
And join us back at rehearsal
when you're ready.

07:20.296 --> 07:21.461
I really appreciate

07:21.463 --> 07:23.263
- you getting here so quickly.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.598
It's what we do.

07:27.769 --> 07:29.703
Oh, my gosh.

07:29.705 --> 07:31.505
Wow.

07:31.507 --> 07:33.674
For a second there,
I thought I'd cursed the show.

07:33.676 --> 07:36.276
Dare I ask how you may have done that?

07:36.278 --> 07:38.845
I said <i>MacBeth.</i> Oh, my God...!

07:38.847 --> 07:40.314
Why do I keep saying that?

07:40.316 --> 07:41.682
Maybe your corset's too tight.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.116
- Why can't you say <i>MacBeth?</i>
- No, no!

07:43.118 --> 07:45.185
- Shh! Just...
- What?

07:45.187 --> 07:47.254
It is considered taboo
to say in a theater.

07:47.256 --> 07:48.789
It can curse a production.

07:48.791 --> 07:51.858
You have to call it "The Scottish Play."

07:51.860 --> 07:53.460
I know. Divya, you may find it

07:53.462 --> 07:54.895
hard to believe, I... I actually was once

07:54.897 --> 07:56.229
kind of a serious thespian.

07:56.231 --> 07:57.998
Yeah, he begged me
to leave gross anatomy early

07:58.000 --> 07:59.800
so I could see him in the title role

07:59.802 --> 08:01.735
of <i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>
He played a pirate.

08:01.737 --> 08:03.203
That was freshman year.

08:03.205 --> 08:04.438
I was just in it for the girls then.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.840
But I... I played
much bigger roles after that.

08:06.842 --> 08:10.043
I... I was Banquo in <i>MacBeth.</i> Oh, my God!

08:10.045 --> 08:11.978
- Someone tape my mouth shut.
- I will.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.580
Oh, good. You're still here.

08:13.582 --> 08:15.949
They need to see you on stage.
Lysander can't see.

08:28.329 --> 08:30.764
So what happened, exactly?

08:30.766 --> 08:32.732
Uh, one of the fairies was sprinkling

08:32.735 --> 08:34.768
a little "love-in-idleness" on my eyes,

08:34.770 --> 08:36.403
and some got <i>in</i> my eye.

08:36.405 --> 08:37.904
A little what in what?

08:37.905 --> 08:39.405
"Love-in-idleness."

08:39.408 --> 08:41.875
It's an enchanted juice
that makes people fall in love.

08:43.177 --> 08:44.544
It's my favorite play.

08:44.546 --> 08:46.747
- Mmm.
- Except we don't use juice.

08:46.749 --> 08:48.281
We use fairy dust.

08:48.283 --> 08:52.052
Or, in your case, glitter.

08:52.054 --> 08:54.421
It looks like you have
a corneal foreign body

08:54.423 --> 08:55.889
that didn't wash out.

08:55.891 --> 08:57.924
It's a delicate procedure
and needs to be removed

08:57.926 --> 08:59.793
in a more sterile environment.

08:59.795 --> 09:01.261
Well, I'll take him
to Hamptons Heritage.

09:01.263 --> 09:02.763
Thanks, Divya.

09:02.765 --> 09:05.732
Okay.

09:07.202 --> 09:09.436
Oh.

09:09.438 --> 09:12.406
Now am I dead,

09:12.408 --> 09:15.575
now am I fled.

09:15.577 --> 09:18.011
My soul is in the sky.

09:18.013 --> 09:21.415
Tongue, lose thy light.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.050
Moon, take flight.

09:26.287 --> 09:30.390
Now die... Die...

09:30.392 --> 09:32.092
Die...

09:32.094 --> 09:36.229
Die...

09:38.500 --> 09:41.368
Die!

09:41.370 --> 09:43.069
Okay.

09:43.071 --> 09:44.070
Nice rehearsal.

09:44.072 --> 09:46.606
Nice work, Gabe.

09:46.608 --> 09:48.008
Let's take a little break,

09:48.010 --> 09:50.010
and then we'll come back
at the top of act five

09:50.012 --> 09:51.378
- in about half an hour.
- Oof.

09:51.380 --> 09:52.579
You need a little help there, bud?

09:52.581 --> 09:54.614
Oh...
Thank you.

09:54.616 --> 09:56.783
Hey, are you okay?

09:56.785 --> 09:58.919
- I'm a doctor.
- Oh.

09:58.921 --> 10:01.121
Could you meet me in my dressing room

10:01.123 --> 10:03.457
- in a few minutes?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:03.459 --> 10:04.825
Thank you.

10:04.827 --> 10:09.095
Um, in... in gratitude
for your warm welcome,

10:09.097 --> 10:12.666
I brought you all a little gift.

10:12.668 --> 10:16.136
"A quart of ale is a dish for a king."

10:16.138 --> 10:18.972
Go! May you all be kings.

10:21.443 --> 10:23.977
There goes act five.

10:33.654 --> 10:35.722
Yep.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.691
Definitely something stuck in there.

10:37.693 --> 10:39.960
But I got it. I'll call ophthalmology

10:39.962 --> 10:41.428
for your follow up.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.130
They'll prescribe
some antibiotic eye drops.

10:44.132 --> 10:47.534
And, uh, maybe I can find you
an old-school eye patch.

10:47.536 --> 10:50.837
You can be the pirate fairy.

10:50.839 --> 10:52.038
I'm not a fairy.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.473
You're wearing tights.

10:55.476 --> 10:57.777
Hey! Since you're
not working here anymore,

10:57.779 --> 10:58.945
you must miss me.

10:58.947 --> 11:00.313
Why don't you finally accept a date

11:00.315 --> 11:02.315
instead of just bringing me patients?

11:02.317 --> 11:04.518
- I told you...
- As friends.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.686
Just friends... a friend date.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.392
- Wha... what?
- Well, it looks like

11:12.394 --> 11:14.461
you got a little fairy dust
sprinkled on you too.

11:14.463 --> 11:15.862
Either that, or you went crazy

11:15.864 --> 11:17.831
with the body glitter this morning.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.366
You know what that means.

11:19.368 --> 11:22.369
"The juice of it
on sleeping eyelids laid,"

11:22.371 --> 11:24.738
"will make or man or woman madly dote,"

11:24.740 --> 11:27.173
"upon the next live creature
that it sees."

11:27.175 --> 11:29.743
Is that from <i>Zombieland?</i>

11:29.745 --> 11:32.546
No! It's Shakespeare.

11:32.548 --> 11:34.147
It... it's <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

11:34.149 --> 11:36.349
Oh! Hey, I saw a poster for that.

11:36.351 --> 11:39.019
You know, might be a nice outing

11:39.021 --> 11:41.354
for a couple of... friends.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.323
What do you say?

11:43.325 --> 11:44.925
I'm already going with a friend.

11:44.927 --> 11:47.093
I'll be back.

11:47.095 --> 11:50.363
Your loss, Katdare.

11:50.365 --> 11:52.332
Please don't ask.

11:52.334 --> 11:56.069
I am so glad that you agreed
to join me on Saturday.

11:56.071 --> 11:59.372
Yeah, about that...

11:59.374 --> 12:02.943
Would you hate me forever if I bailed?

12:02.945 --> 12:04.744
What? You're not a fan of the bard?

12:04.746 --> 12:06.713
Who's the bard?

12:06.715 --> 12:09.449
- You just answered my question.
- No...

12:09.451 --> 12:13.219
I just got an offer that's
a little bit more my speed.

12:13.221 --> 12:15.121
And besides,
you do not want to have to spend

12:15.123 --> 12:17.223
the whole evening
explaining the play to me.

12:17.225 --> 12:18.291
No, no, that's fine, you know?

12:18.293 --> 12:20.527
I'll just sit there. By myself.

12:20.529 --> 12:21.828
Pathetically.

12:21.830 --> 12:24.397
I'm sorry.

12:24.399 --> 12:26.633
You know what? I don't have to go.

12:26.635 --> 12:28.368
- I don't have to go.
- I'm kidding.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.537
Go. I will just return the second ticket

12:30.539 --> 12:34.040
- to the box office.
- Okay.

12:34.042 --> 12:36.376
Okay.

12:37.578 --> 12:39.179
It'll just be a couple of minutes

12:39.181 --> 12:40.914
before the picture comes up.

12:40.916 --> 12:43.950
Here you go.

12:43.952 --> 12:47.821
Is this a Hamptons theatre
initiation prank?

12:47.823 --> 12:49.756
Close. Part of
the pulmonary function test.

12:49.758 --> 12:51.591
The spirometer measures the amount

12:51.593 --> 12:53.727
of air entering and leaving your lungs.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.229
If you could open, please? Good.

12:56.231 --> 12:58.498
Now I need you to inhale to your maximum.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.734
Now exhale quickly and completely

13:00.736 --> 13:02.502
till there's no air left in your lungs.

13:02.504 --> 13:04.070
Keep blowing.

13:04.072 --> 13:05.205
Keep blowing.

13:05.207 --> 13:06.840
Keep blowing.

13:06.842 --> 13:08.008
Good.

13:09.678 --> 13:13.046
Okay, your expiratory volume
and flow look great.

13:13.048 --> 13:15.015
As does your forced vital capacity.

13:15.017 --> 13:17.717
And they say
Elizabethan English is opaque.

13:17.719 --> 13:22.722
Okay, in other words,
no signs of pulmonary disease.

13:24.159 --> 13:26.593
And there's no hyperinflation

13:26.595 --> 13:28.228
or destroyed tissue in your lungs.

13:28.230 --> 13:30.597
Actually, I'm feeling pretty spry now.

13:30.599 --> 13:33.033
Um...

13:33.035 --> 13:34.701
Sorry. How rude of me.

13:34.703 --> 13:35.835
Did you want one?

13:35.837 --> 13:37.337
The truck's here for the afternoon.

13:37.339 --> 13:38.672
No thank you. On duty.

13:38.674 --> 13:40.340
And for that matter, so are you.

13:40.342 --> 13:42.042
Ah, yes. But unlike a doctor,

13:42.044 --> 13:43.843
spirits are part of an actor's life.

13:43.845 --> 13:45.578
A veritable prerequisite.

13:45.580 --> 13:46.846
Plus, I'm Irish.

13:46.848 --> 13:49.549
Listen, Gabe, um...

13:49.551 --> 13:51.818
I know it's been a while
since you've performed live.

13:51.820 --> 13:54.487
But I don't think
the cigars and the booze

13:54.489 --> 13:56.923
are going to help
your performance or your health.

13:56.925 --> 13:59.159
Have you seen me perform live?

13:59.161 --> 14:02.128
- No.
- Then how do you know?

14:02.130 --> 14:03.897
Oh, all right.

14:27.788 --> 14:29.789
Uh, good morning.

14:29.791 --> 14:31.324
- Is everything okay in there?
- No.

14:31.326 --> 14:32.625
No, I, um... I just...

14:32.627 --> 14:34.060
I found out that the Mets lost.

14:34.062 --> 14:36.062
That's six in a row.
And now they're trading

14:36.064 --> 14:39.566
their number one pitcher,
so why do I even bother?

14:39.568 --> 14:44.838
Yes. I program my car to follow the Mets.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.740
Now you think I'm a freak.

14:46.742 --> 14:49.342
I think you're a fan.
Welcome to the club.

14:49.344 --> 14:52.045
Oh. Okay.

14:52.047 --> 14:54.147
Hey, um, have you seen Jack lately?

14:54.149 --> 14:55.982
We played 18 yesterday,

14:55.984 --> 14:58.218
not that he considers what I do
on a golf course <i>playing.</i>

14:58.220 --> 15:01.221
Wow. I'm glad to hear
he's in such good spirits.

15:01.223 --> 15:02.789
Patients with his numbers

15:02.791 --> 15:04.324
are usually pretty weak and lethargic.

15:04.326 --> 15:06.526
Wait. Have his numbers changed?

15:06.528 --> 15:09.229
His B.U.N. and creatinine are rising,

15:09.231 --> 15:11.664
and his glomerular filtration
rate is <i>way</i> down.

15:11.666 --> 15:15.368
That's why he has
an appointment with you today.

15:15.370 --> 15:17.203
With me and a surgeon. He's coming in

15:17.205 --> 15:19.072
to have an arteriovenous
fistula installed

15:19.074 --> 15:21.407
- in prep for starting dialysis.
- Dialysis?

15:21.409 --> 15:24.944
- I assumed you knew.
- No, I didn't.

15:24.946 --> 15:29.516
Jack's disease is really
progressing fast, Hank.

15:29.518 --> 15:32.252
Um, I'll see you later.

15:32.254 --> 15:35.555
Yeah.

15:40.181 --> 15:42.216
Yes, Jack. It is a simple surgery.

15:42.218 --> 15:44.618
But you will be anesthetized.
I'll give you a lift.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.721
Do not make me fire you
as my friend also.

15:47.723 --> 15:49.156
Man, you really do suck at this.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.991
What? Friends give friends rides.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.793
Yeah, well, I don't need hand-holding.

15:52.795 --> 15:54.595
So I'll keep both hands on the wheel.

15:54.597 --> 15:56.496
I'll just drive you home.
No good-night kiss.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.031
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, wait, um,

15:58.033 --> 15:59.199
do you hear that sound?

15:59.201 --> 16:00.567
- What sound?
- I don't know.

16:00.569 --> 16:01.868
It sounds like a beep or something.

16:01.870 --> 16:03.937
No, I don't hear...

16:05.808 --> 16:07.474
Ready to reel in some tunnies?

16:07.476 --> 16:08.642
Are you?

16:08.644 --> 16:10.777
It sounds like you have
some other obligations.

16:10.779 --> 16:13.213
Yeah, well, nothing trumps
bluefin, though. Agreed?

16:13.215 --> 16:15.515
I don't know. Are you a troller?

16:15.517 --> 16:16.883
Or do you chunk?

16:16.885 --> 16:19.353
Um...

16:19.355 --> 16:22.756
I'm...

16:22.758 --> 16:25.158
flexible.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.494
Let's go fishing.

16:27.496 --> 16:29.029
- Let's go fishing!
- Yes.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.536
Ah! Glad to see you relaxing.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.138
You look like you're feeling better.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.340
Wrong on both counts.

16:40.342 --> 16:43.243
I'm working hard.

16:43.245 --> 16:46.213
Feeling lousy...
Bloated.

16:46.215 --> 16:49.483
Hmm. Any chest pains?

16:49.485 --> 16:51.318
Ah, I'm hoping it's heartburn.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.320
Well, have you been eating
any greasy foods?

16:53.322 --> 16:55.322
No, I've been off the fat

16:55.324 --> 16:58.492
since I started prepping
for the demands of the stage.

16:58.494 --> 17:02.429
Believe it or not, I've lost
half a stone. That's...

17:02.431 --> 17:03.764
Seven pounds. Good for you.

17:03.766 --> 17:05.499
But you do still drink and smoke cigars.

17:05.501 --> 17:08.001
Well, I'm not up for sainthood.

17:08.002 --> 17:10.503
But I have cut back since our last chat.

17:10.506 --> 17:12.239
Look, I'm concerned
that you're bloated,

17:12.241 --> 17:14.141
because that could be a sign
of heart problems.

17:14.143 --> 17:16.542
Now, I'd like to take you
for a full cardiac work up.

17:16.545 --> 17:18.011
Not today, doctor.

17:18.012 --> 17:22.214
The stage manager's on his way
over to help me run lines.

17:22.217 --> 17:25.585
We open tonight.

17:25.587 --> 17:29.222
What if we could, as Shakespeare said,

17:29.224 --> 17:31.325
"kill two birds with one stone"?

17:31.327 --> 17:33.493
Ovid actually coined that one.

17:33.495 --> 17:36.830
What did you have in mind?

17:40.469 --> 17:41.735
Why do they run away

17:41.737 --> 17:44.771
this is knavery of them
to make me afeared.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.741
"Oh, bottom, thou art changed!"

17:47.743 --> 17:49.276
"What do I see on thee?"

17:49.278 --> 17:50.811
What do you see?

17:50.813 --> 17:53.113
You see an ass-head of your own, do you?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.614
Well, "bless thee bottom, bless thee!"

17:54.616 --> 17:56.149
"Thou art translated."

17:57.953 --> 17:59.286
"I see"...

17:59.288 --> 18:00.487
Don't tell me!

18:00.489 --> 18:02.189
Okay, tell me.

18:02.191 --> 18:03.857
"I see their knavery"...

18:03.859 --> 18:04.991
I see their knavery.

18:04.993 --> 18:06.393
This is to make an ass of me.

18:06.395 --> 18:08.028
Speaking of asses...

18:08.030 --> 18:09.463
mine's throbbing.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.031
How long do I have to ride this thing?

18:11.033 --> 18:13.900
Oh, oh, sorry.
You were done a few seconds ago.

18:13.902 --> 18:15.969
I just... I got caught up in the story.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.504
What happens next?

18:17.506 --> 18:19.873
Well, the, uh...
the queen of the fairies,

18:19.875 --> 18:22.242
- she sees him as an ass.
- Uh-huh.

18:22.244 --> 18:24.578
- And she falls in love.
- You do know the play.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.413
Yeah! Well, yeah,

18:26.415 --> 18:27.714
I'm not just a bit player,

18:27.716 --> 18:30.717
as you may have guessed.

18:30.719 --> 18:32.819
Yeah, the road not taken and all.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.922
It's a rare man, once bitten,
who can surrender the spotlight.

18:35.924 --> 18:37.924
Yes. Some would say he hasn't.

18:37.926 --> 18:40.394
The stage is a stern mistress.

18:40.396 --> 18:44.064
When I started making films,
I promised myself

18:44.066 --> 18:45.899
that I wouldn't sell out...

18:45.901 --> 18:48.001
squander my gift.

18:48.003 --> 18:51.371
That I could make money,
return to my first love

18:51.373 --> 18:53.039
and still prove worthy.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.941
"Prove worthy"?

18:54.943 --> 18:56.777
Dude, your clayface...

18:56.779 --> 18:59.746
<i>the</i> best thing
in the last <i>Batman</i> movie, easy.

18:59.748 --> 19:02.449
Sadly true.

19:02.451 --> 19:06.686
Tell me, do you detect
any cardiac issues?

19:06.688 --> 19:08.789
Uh, well, we have to wait
to get your cardiac enzymes

19:08.791 --> 19:10.223
back from the lab.

19:10.225 --> 19:13.059
But I see no evidence
of coronary artery disease.

19:13.061 --> 19:14.961
- Awesome.
- So it's only

19:14.963 --> 19:19.032
my deep-seated insecurity
keeping me up nights.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.200
Do you have insomnia?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.002
Only when I try to sleep.

19:22.004 --> 19:24.771
The indigestion doesn't help.

19:24.773 --> 19:27.607
I think you're suffering
from acid reflux.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.376
Which can be stress-induced.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.478
So, how 'bout I write
a prescription for Prevacid,

19:31.480 --> 19:33.980
we hold off on predicting
your performance will fail,

19:33.982 --> 19:36.016
and let the show go on?

19:45.393 --> 19:47.961
- Divya. What a surprise!
- Raj.

19:47.963 --> 19:49.796
Well, not really a surprise.

19:49.798 --> 19:51.331
I know how you love this play.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.732
- I do.
- I was actually

19:52.734 --> 19:54.601
going to call you.

19:54.603 --> 19:57.070
I will have another check
for your parents very soon.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.772
No, no. Not about that.

19:58.774 --> 20:01.241
I knew you'd be attending opening night.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.143
You know me so well.

20:03.145 --> 20:06.179
I didn't want to presume
how you might feel,

20:06.181 --> 20:10.050
but I'm bringing someone to the play.

20:10.052 --> 20:11.218
I knew we might run into you,

20:11.220 --> 20:12.652
and I didn't want it to be awkward.

20:12.654 --> 20:15.355
- You have a date!
- Yes!

20:15.357 --> 20:17.757
Good! That's good.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.925
My gosh, I'm so happy.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.194
No, of course it's not a problem.

20:21.196 --> 20:22.996
- Next in line, please.
- Great.

20:22.998 --> 20:25.098
- We'll see you then.
- Yes, you will.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.166
Next in line.

20:34.009 --> 20:35.742
Dr. Van Dyke here. Leave a message.

20:35.744 --> 20:38.879
V.D.! Katdare, here.

20:38.881 --> 20:41.081
Call me.

20:41.083 --> 20:44.684
So I figured,
since you can't out to eat,

20:44.686 --> 20:47.020
I would bring the nourishment to you.

20:47.022 --> 20:48.355
Okay, I'm so glad you're here.

20:48.357 --> 20:50.323
- I'm dying to tell you...
- Paige, if Evan

20:50.325 --> 20:51.825
doesn't mind stepping on with you,

20:51.827 --> 20:53.226
- we need to test the platform.
- Okay. Absolutely.

20:53.228 --> 20:55.662
- Jump on, Evan.
- Onto the... onto the thing?

20:55.664 --> 20:57.163
- Come on.
- The thing's going to hold

20:57.165 --> 20:58.532
- both of us?
- Well, it better.

20:58.534 --> 20:59.599
It's got to hold a flock of fairies.

20:59.601 --> 21:00.934
Wow. Well,

21:00.936 --> 21:03.069
given the fact that
I've cursed the show...

21:03.071 --> 21:05.672
I have a little bit of... ah!

21:05.674 --> 21:07.407
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:07.409 --> 21:11.144
So, you know how I was hoping
to make an impression on Julie?

21:11.146 --> 21:12.679
Yes. You mean, Hankmed healing

21:12.681 --> 21:14.214
three of her actors didn't do the job?

21:14.216 --> 21:17.684
Well, she's been offered
a gig... eight weeks in Stratford.

21:17.686 --> 21:19.586
And if she accepts it,
she wants me to go with her

21:19.588 --> 21:21.021
as her scenic artist.

21:21.023 --> 21:22.055
- What?
- Yeah!

21:22.057 --> 21:23.256
That's amazing.

21:23.258 --> 21:24.558
I knew she'd be impressed.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.659
That's amazing!

21:25.661 --> 21:27.093
And with my mom doing so much better,

21:27.095 --> 21:29.029
this is something I could actually do.

21:29.031 --> 21:31.598
Absolutely. And Connecticut's so close.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.433
I could, like, bring you lunch every day.

21:33.435 --> 21:36.002
Oh, no no no,
it's not Stratford, Connecticut,

21:36.004 --> 21:38.605
it's Stratford-upon-Avon.

21:38.607 --> 21:41.041
- England.
- Yeah.

21:41.043 --> 21:43.643
Well, that's not so close.

21:43.645 --> 21:45.946
No, but you could come visit.

21:47.748 --> 21:50.150
It's our busiest time of year.

21:50.152 --> 21:53.520
Well, it's... it's just eight weeks.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.622
Eight weeks
is two whole months, though.

21:55.624 --> 21:57.190
That's a sixth of the year.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.459
That's the rest of the summer.

21:59.461 --> 22:01.995
- Okay, we're coming down.
- Okay.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.835
Yeah, you know what? That's too long.

22:08.837 --> 22:11.204
That's too long. And I don't want to

22:11.206 --> 22:13.340
bite off more than I'm ready for.

22:13.342 --> 22:15.342
You know, Julie hasn't even
accepted this yet,

22:15.344 --> 22:17.010
so it's probably not even
going to happen.

22:17.012 --> 22:19.312
So never mind, never mind.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.455
Red leather, yellow leather.
Good blood, bad blood.

22:36.457 --> 22:38.824
Culligan and Calla Lily.
Culligan and Calla Lily.

22:38.826 --> 22:42.461
Okay, blood pressure,
heart and lungs are fine.

22:42.463 --> 22:43.696
You're good to go.

22:43.698 --> 22:46.298
Uh, right. Thanks for everything.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.001
Um...

22:49.003 --> 22:50.436
are you still having reflux?

22:50.438 --> 22:52.471
Oh, no. Just plain old butterflies.

22:52.473 --> 22:54.273
All right. Well, it's not easy

22:54.275 --> 22:58.410
for a doctor to say this,
but break a leg.

23:10.091 --> 23:12.391
Manala, melele,

23:12.393 --> 23:15.828
mee... meenee...

23:15.830 --> 23:21.000
mo... oo-aa-yah...

23:21.002 --> 23:22.101
Why are you doing that?

23:22.103 --> 23:23.969
It's called vocalizing.

23:23.971 --> 23:25.204
I'm... I'm warming up.

23:25.206 --> 23:26.405
You have one line three hours from now.

23:26.407 --> 23:27.573
But nice tunic.

23:27.575 --> 23:29.241
Why are you back here?

23:29.243 --> 23:30.943
Uh, Paige is supposed
to sit next to me,

23:30.945 --> 23:32.411
but she's putting the finishing touches

23:32.413 --> 23:35.447
- on her finishing touches.
- Well, she's an artist, Hank.

23:35.449 --> 23:37.783
- You wouldn't understand.
- Well, it looks gorgeous.

23:37.785 --> 23:40.052
Yeah, I know. The director wants her

23:40.054 --> 23:42.087
to do a job in England.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.555
That's fantastic.

23:43.557 --> 23:44.823
Yeah, it's probably not
going to pan out,

23:44.825 --> 23:46.959
but it's definitely an honor
to be asked, though.

23:46.961 --> 23:48.794
Why won't it pan out?

23:48.796 --> 23:52.631
Um, because it's for two months.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.134
And she's got her mind
on school in the fall.

23:55.136 --> 23:56.435
Two months is only eight weeks.

23:56.437 --> 23:57.870
What could go wrong in eight weeks?

23:57.872 --> 23:59.305
- Are you kidding?
- No.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.141
That's 60 whole days with us apart.

24:02.143 --> 24:04.109
Plus she'll be in the theater community,

24:04.111 --> 24:05.577
surrounded by actors and artists.

24:05.579 --> 24:08.414
Ev, you told her to go, right?

24:08.416 --> 24:10.916
I didn't tell her... anything.

24:10.918 --> 24:13.218
I mean, I'll support
whatever she decides.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.454
The whole Parsons thing
is me supporting her.

24:15.456 --> 24:17.256
Well, yeah. Design school in Manhattan

24:17.258 --> 24:19.358
is pretty easy to support.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.793
What are you getting at?

24:20.795 --> 24:23.295
Look, this sounds like
a great opportunity for Paige.

24:23.297 --> 24:24.563
But you know how she is.

24:24.565 --> 24:26.231
Pray tell.

24:26.233 --> 24:29.068
She puts everyone
she cares about first.

24:29.070 --> 24:31.470
This is <i>her</i> decision.

24:33.006 --> 24:36.342
I bet she can make you believe that.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.645
- Hey!
- Hi.

24:39.647 --> 24:41.347
Nice work, Paige. This looks awesome.

24:41.349 --> 24:42.448
Thank you.

24:42.450 --> 24:44.550
I just pray the trees dry in time

24:44.552 --> 24:46.218
and look okay under the lights.

24:46.220 --> 24:49.021
I don't want to let Julie
or anyone down, you know?

24:49.023 --> 24:50.389
Oh!

24:50.391 --> 24:51.890
- We got to get going.
- Oh, okay.

24:51.892 --> 24:53.325
- Let's grab our seats.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.794
Uh, break your femur.

24:55.796 --> 24:57.896
You're going to be great. Really.

24:57.898 --> 25:01.800
I love you.

25:06.107 --> 25:08.507
Four days will quickly
steep themselves in night...

25:08.509 --> 25:11.744
four nights will quickly
dream away the time...

25:11.746 --> 25:14.346
and then the moon, like to a silver bow

25:14.348 --> 25:15.514
new-bent in heaven,

25:15.516 --> 25:18.751
shall behold the night
of our solemnities.

25:18.753 --> 25:20.252
Go, Philostrate,

25:20.254 --> 25:24.156
stir up the Athenian youth
to merriments...

25:24.158 --> 25:25.591
an' I will hide my face,

25:25.593 --> 25:27.459
let me play Thisby too...

25:27.461 --> 25:31.497
I'll speak in a monstrous little voice...

25:31.499 --> 25:33.999
Thisne, Thisne.

25:34.001 --> 25:39.138
Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear,

25:39.140 --> 25:42.274
Thisby dear, and lady dear...

26:00.428 --> 26:02.194
Through the forest have I gone,

26:02.196 --> 26:05.831
but Athenian found I none,

26:05.833 --> 26:09.902
on whose eyes I might approve

26:09.904 --> 26:13.505
this flower's force in stirring love.

26:18.411 --> 26:22.681
When thou wak'st, let love forbid

26:22.683 --> 26:25.584
sleep his seat on thy eyelid.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.420
So awake when I am gone.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.593
For I must to Oberon!

26:46.840 --> 26:51.143
Okay, drinks. My favorite part so far.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.715
Divya, I want you to meet Karen.

26:56.717 --> 26:58.717
Karen, so nice to meet you.

26:58.719 --> 27:00.953
Divya, I've heard all about you.

27:00.955 --> 27:04.690
Paul, this is Karen and Raj.

27:04.692 --> 27:09.862
Karen, Raj. Oh! Raj!

27:09.864 --> 27:11.296
A pleasure.

27:11.298 --> 27:16.268
<i>Dr.</i> Paul Van Dyke. So,

27:16.270 --> 27:18.804
is everyone as lost as I am?

27:18.806 --> 27:20.539
That depends. How many glasses

27:20.541 --> 27:21.707
of champagne have you had?

27:21.709 --> 27:22.808
I mean the play.

27:22.810 --> 27:26.078
The, uh, the fairies are all mad

27:26.080 --> 27:27.913
about some changeling?

27:27.915 --> 27:29.748
Who, I guess, is the chick with the legs?

27:29.750 --> 27:32.384
No. No, that's puck.

27:32.386 --> 27:33.752
It is confusing.

27:33.754 --> 27:35.888
The changeling isn't even on stage.

27:35.890 --> 27:37.389
Uh, it's a reference to the past.

27:37.391 --> 27:38.557
Oh, she knows the play.

27:38.559 --> 27:40.893
K. J. covers theater for <i>The Star.</i>

27:40.895 --> 27:44.329
- You're K. J. Golan?
- Mmm.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.231
I love your reviews.

27:46.233 --> 27:48.767
- Thank you.
- Shall we?

27:48.769 --> 27:50.435
I'm running to the ladies...

27:50.437 --> 27:52.838
they're doing the long version.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.474
Whoa, long version? We need refills.

28:00.281 --> 28:02.848
She's lovely, Raj.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.984
Thanks to you,
I'm in love for the first time.

28:05.986 --> 28:09.087
I'm so happy for you.

28:09.089 --> 28:12.224
I would never have had the courage

28:12.226 --> 28:15.294
to end our arrangement.

28:15.296 --> 28:19.898
You gave me the chance to move on.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.337
And you have.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.009
I'm afraid you've blown
your Achilles tendon.

28:31.011 --> 28:33.378
- I was just hopping.
- Yeah, well that's

28:33.380 --> 28:35.781
- how it happens.
- Well, get me up on crutches.

28:35.783 --> 28:37.382
We have two acts to go.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.718
Sorry. Rest, elevation, ice.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.053
I need to splint your leg,
and you're not going

28:41.055 --> 28:42.721
to be able to put any weight on it.

28:42.723 --> 28:44.423
- You could risk permanent damage.
- This can't be happening.

28:44.425 --> 28:47.292
My understudy called in sick. I swear,

28:47.294 --> 28:48.393
this production was cursed.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.295
Evan.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.632
- What?
- He knows the part.

28:53.634 --> 28:55.734
He played puck.

28:55.736 --> 28:59.137
In... in high school.

28:59.139 --> 29:01.473
You've been watching all week,
spouting lines.

29:01.475 --> 29:03.909
Yeah, the ones I remember.

29:03.911 --> 29:06.411
Ah, it's worth a shot.
He might pull it off.

29:06.413 --> 29:08.747
He read with me.
He's certainly got the, uh...

29:08.749 --> 29:10.916
- Chops?
- Was going to say "balls."

29:10.918 --> 29:12.351
- But either way.
- We could announce

29:12.353 --> 29:15.053
a substitution, but everyone might leave.

29:15.055 --> 29:17.055
Oh, they'll stay! It's high drama

29:17.057 --> 29:20.058
watching someone step out
on the tightrope, unprepared.

29:20.060 --> 29:23.061
Okay, I mean, as much
as I would love to help...

29:23.063 --> 29:24.296
I really would...

29:24.298 --> 29:26.365
I just... I won't remember all the lines.

29:26.367 --> 29:29.401
You may not have to.

29:32.538 --> 29:36.675
Some man or other must present wall...

29:36.677 --> 29:39.044
and hold his fingers thus,

29:39.046 --> 29:42.381
and through that cranny
must Pyramus and Thisby whisper.

29:42.383 --> 29:47.819
What hempen homespuns
have we swaggering here?

29:47.821 --> 29:49.855
So near the <i>cradle...</i>

29:49.857 --> 29:52.591
the cradle of the fairy queen.

29:53.827 --> 29:56.061
- Everybody...
- Everyone...

30:04.737 --> 30:08.573
Yum, yum, yum. Num, num, num.

30:08.575 --> 30:10.075
So much for non-fat.

30:10.077 --> 30:11.677
I should have asked about bottom's diet.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.046
Yeah, bottom's a pig.

30:14.048 --> 30:18.116
What angel wakes me
from my flowering bed?

30:18.118 --> 30:20.252
- Hee-haw.
- I pray thee,

30:20.254 --> 30:23.388
gentle mortal, sing again...

30:24.992 --> 30:27.592
Uh, [clears throat] Monsieur Cobweb,

30:27.594 --> 30:31.029
get you your weapons and find me...

30:31.031 --> 30:33.999
a red-hipped... bumble-bee.

30:34.001 --> 30:36.668
And bring me the honey pot.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.804
And good monsieur...

30:38.806 --> 30:40.672
take care the honey pot

30:40.674 --> 30:43.375
break not.

30:43.377 --> 30:46.244
Ow.

30:46.246 --> 30:50.916
He eats... and then he lies down?

30:50.918 --> 30:53.585
What's wrong?

30:53.587 --> 30:56.021
Divya.

30:58.624 --> 31:04.029
Wilt thou at ninny's tomb
meet me straightway?

31:04.031 --> 31:05.430
Here, here. Drink this.

31:05.432 --> 31:07.265
- What's wrong?
- You were short of breath

31:07.267 --> 31:08.767
after lying down,
before exerting yourself.

31:08.769 --> 31:10.168
- Oh!
- Are you having pain?

31:10.170 --> 31:12.604
- Maybe!
- We need to take an X-ray.

31:12.606 --> 31:14.539
- You already have an X-ray.
- Sitting up.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.441
- We need one lying down.
- Ah!

31:16.443 --> 31:18.276
Don't worry. You won't miss your cue.

31:18.278 --> 31:20.545
I think a hiatal hernia's
causing your symptoms.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.781
- A what hernia?
- Hiatal.

31:22.783 --> 31:24.282
The stomach slides up
into the chest through a tear

31:24.284 --> 31:26.852
in the diaphragm, when you lie down.

31:26.854 --> 31:28.420
When you stand up,
it slides back in place,

31:28.422 --> 31:29.788
so it wouldn't have shown
on the first X-ray.

31:29.790 --> 31:31.289
But am I in any danger?

31:31.291 --> 31:33.458
It's usually not emergent.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.327
But I've seen what you do next.

31:35.329 --> 31:36.828
You die on stage.

31:36.830 --> 31:38.897
And if you lie down,
you may not have the breath

31:38.899 --> 31:40.198
to get up at all.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.969
I can adjust.

31:43.971 --> 31:48.640
Oh, wherefore, nature,
didst though lions frame?

31:48.642 --> 31:53.278
Thus die I. Thus, thus, thus.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.013
Thus, blah.

31:55.015 --> 31:57.048
We really didn't go

31:57.050 --> 31:58.417
to all this trouble
just for a hiatal hernia,

31:58.419 --> 32:00.152
- did we?
- He looks distressed.

32:00.154 --> 32:03.789
I thought we should rule out
more... emergent... conditions.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.324
Now, die!

32:06.326 --> 32:08.293
Khhhh! Die!

32:08.295 --> 32:12.030
Die! Die!

32:16.170 --> 32:20.906
<i>Die!</i>

32:28.115 --> 32:29.347
If we don't get him to surgery now,

32:29.349 --> 32:30.715
his stomach will perforate.

32:30.717 --> 32:33.084
Oh, my God. He really could die.

32:49.949 --> 32:51.616
- Ooh!
- Okay, okay.

32:51.618 --> 32:53.151
We have to get you to the hospital.

32:53.153 --> 32:55.053
Your X-ray showed a hiatal hernia.

32:55.055 --> 32:57.722
But this time it couldn't
slide back in place.

32:57.724 --> 32:58.890
A section of your stomach twisted

32:58.892 --> 33:00.058
and got stuck in your chest cavity.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.326
It's called a gastric volvulus.

33:01.328 --> 33:02.694
You need immediate surgery

33:02.696 --> 33:04.295
before the twisted portion ruptures.

33:04.297 --> 33:05.797
What? My stomach could burst?

33:05.799 --> 33:07.865
- Oh, God!
- How... how's the pain?

33:07.867 --> 33:09.367
- Worse!
- Okay. I'm sorry you'll miss

33:09.369 --> 33:11.169
your ovation,
but an ambulance is on its way.

33:11.171 --> 33:12.804
Oh, bottom will miss the applause,

33:12.806 --> 33:14.973
but I have a lot invested in this belly.

33:14.975 --> 33:16.274
Good, let's go.

33:16.276 --> 33:19.010
Here we go.

33:19.012 --> 33:23.047
If we shadows have offended,

33:23.049 --> 33:27.885
think but this, and all is mended,

33:27.887 --> 33:30.355
that you have but slumber'd here

33:30.357 --> 33:32.857
while these visions did appear.

33:32.859 --> 33:34.359
And this weak and idle theme...

33:34.361 --> 33:36.928
And this weak and idle theme...

33:36.930 --> 33:38.229
"No more yielding but a dream"...

33:38.231 --> 33:42.367
...no more yielding but a dream.

33:42.369 --> 33:45.670
Gentles, do not...

33:45.672 --> 33:46.771
Reprehend.

33:46.773 --> 33:50.375
Do not...

33:50.377 --> 33:52.443
Repre...

33:57.082 --> 33:58.816
Oh, my God.

34:00.586 --> 34:02.687
Gentles... gentles, do not... gentles...

34:04.491 --> 34:07.992
Gentles... gentles, do not...

34:09.194 --> 34:10.895
Reprehend!

34:10.897 --> 34:12.597
Reprehend!

34:12.599 --> 34:16.333
If you pardon, we shall mend.

34:16.335 --> 34:18.503
And as I am an honest puck,

34:18.505 --> 34:21.172
if we have unearned luck

34:21.174 --> 34:23.041
now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue,

34:23.043 --> 34:25.909
we will make amends ere long.

34:25.911 --> 34:28.045
Else the puck a liar call...

34:28.047 --> 34:31.916
so, good night unto you all.

34:31.918 --> 34:34.819
Give me your hands, if we be friends,

34:34.821 --> 34:39.123
and Robin shall restore...

34:39.125 --> 34:41.192
amends.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.508
So how happy are you

34:57.510 --> 34:59.711
I was there when you ran into your ex?

34:59.713 --> 35:02.747
I mean, sure, his date was a hottie,

35:02.749 --> 35:04.816
but the second they heard "doctor,"

35:04.818 --> 35:06.551
you were back on even ground.

35:06.553 --> 35:08.753
I wasn't trying to make Raj jealous.

35:08.755 --> 35:12.557
And I certainly do not want him back.

35:12.559 --> 35:15.293
No, but I do want what he has.

35:16.628 --> 35:18.796
I want to be happy.

35:18.798 --> 35:22.633
Me too.

35:24.336 --> 35:26.270
I am so sorry.

35:26.272 --> 35:29.874
I was talking to you as a friend.

35:29.876 --> 35:32.877
We said that we were friends, remember?

35:35.914 --> 35:37.315
We could try...

35:37.317 --> 35:38.383
Pretending?

35:40.152 --> 35:43.855
Trust me, I have been very good at it

35:43.857 --> 35:46.624
since I was a little girl.

35:46.626 --> 35:49.527
But now I want something real.

35:49.529 --> 35:53.431
As much as I've enjoyed being
with you tonight,

35:53.433 --> 35:56.467
as my friend...

35:56.469 --> 35:58.803
I think that you want something more.

35:58.805 --> 36:01.406
More than I do.

36:01.408 --> 36:05.710
Okay.

36:05.712 --> 36:08.045
Your loss, Katdare.

36:16.188 --> 36:18.256
- To the best puck ever.
- And to saving

36:18.258 --> 36:19.924
the very play that you'd cursed.

36:21.261 --> 36:22.794
And my favorite part? Your performance

36:22.796 --> 36:25.530
- was injury-free.
- Nice.

36:25.532 --> 36:27.031
Well, thank you, guys.

36:27.033 --> 36:30.601
Yeah. Um... I wish I had committed more

36:30.603 --> 36:32.136
to that "morning lark" line.

36:32.138 --> 36:34.739
Look, Ev, I know I never
took your acting seriously,

36:34.741 --> 36:37.675
but it turns out...
you got some real chops.

36:37.677 --> 36:38.843
I mean, you were very good.

36:38.845 --> 36:40.344
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

36:40.346 --> 36:41.612
If you had taken it seriously,

36:41.614 --> 36:43.347
you might not have a CFO right now.

36:43.349 --> 36:44.916
- Really?
- W... w... wait. You quit acting

36:44.918 --> 36:46.250
because I made fun of you?

36:46.252 --> 36:50.521
No. You were just so
responsible about your future.

36:50.523 --> 36:53.124
Remember telling me,
"we're on our own now."

36:53.126 --> 36:55.092
"We got to take care of ourselves."

36:55.094 --> 36:58.162
Yeah. I wanted to be responsible too.

36:58.164 --> 37:00.198
That's why I went into econ...

37:00.200 --> 37:02.800
definitely <i>not</i> for the girls.

37:02.802 --> 37:04.969
Wow, I really had influence over you.

37:04.971 --> 37:06.270
I should make fun of you more often.

37:06.272 --> 37:07.605
Coffee.

37:07.607 --> 37:09.173
Okay.

37:14.347 --> 37:17.782
- What's wrong?
- Um, it's Julie.

37:17.784 --> 37:19.717
She's taking that job in Stratford,

37:19.719 --> 37:21.152
and it starts next week.

37:21.154 --> 37:24.222
She wants me to join her.

37:24.224 --> 37:26.424
You know, I'm just going
to let her know right away

37:26.426 --> 37:28.659
- that I can't.
- You can.

37:28.661 --> 37:30.194
You can.

37:30.196 --> 37:33.531
Will I miss you? Like crazy.

37:33.533 --> 37:36.400
Like I don't even want
to imagine how much.

37:36.402 --> 37:38.503
But this is your life.

37:38.505 --> 37:40.371
It's <i>our</i> life.

37:40.373 --> 37:42.573
You are going to be in demand,
because you're awesome.

37:42.575 --> 37:46.143
So we better get used
to being apart, off and on.

37:46.145 --> 37:48.112
Hopefully more on than off.

37:48.114 --> 37:51.816
But you can't turn this down.

37:51.818 --> 37:53.017
I won't let you.

37:54.853 --> 37:58.222
It's your midsummer dream.

37:58.224 --> 38:02.093
So call her back, say yes...

38:02.095 --> 38:05.129
and just make sure she knows
how lucky she is to have you.

38:07.099 --> 38:11.068
Almost as lucky as I am to have you.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.403
Okay, I'm going to call her.

38:12.405 --> 38:13.938
Thank you.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.073
- All right.
- All right.

38:26.437 --> 38:27.704
Looks like you triumphed.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.539
- Indeed.
- Well, your surgery

38:29.541 --> 38:31.141
also got rave reviews.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.143
You should be back to normal in no time.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.678
The bad news?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.546
Well, unfortunately, "in no time"

38:36.548 --> 38:37.881
is going to be a few weeks.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.516
You won't be able to finish
the run of the play.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.586
At least I got to prove to myself

38:42.588 --> 38:45.222
I haven't lost my gift.

38:45.224 --> 38:47.958
By all accounts, everyone else
thinks you've still got it too.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.193
I appreciate your faith in me, Frank.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.428
It's Hank.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.296
Thanks to your catch and this review,

38:53.298 --> 38:55.699
I'll be Broadway bound by fall.

38:57.803 --> 38:58.902
Ooh, Gabe, I got to run.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.036
But save me a house seat.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.305
Uh, balcony's fine.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.949
Wow, that was fast.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.651
I was here seeing a patient.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.720
Your text sounded urgent. What's up?

39:16.722 --> 39:19.356
- Have you spoken to Jack?
- Uh, no.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.557
Something go wrong with his A.V. surgery?

39:20.559 --> 39:22.392
He never came in for the procedure.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.427
- What?
- And he hasn't returned

39:24.429 --> 39:26.229
any of my phone calls.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.731
Hank, I'm worried
that Jack is blowing off

39:27.733 --> 39:30.267
- his treatment all together.
- I should have stayed

39:30.269 --> 39:32.202
on his case, insisted I come with him

39:32.204 --> 39:34.738
for his surgery.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.474
- Shoot.
- I've had plenty of patients

39:37.476 --> 39:39.209
who couldn't come to terms
with their illnesses.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.344
You can't change their minds for them.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.647
They need to do it on their own.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.215
I just...

39:45.217 --> 39:47.918
I hope he comes to his senses
sooner rather than later.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.555
Jack said he wanted to go fishing.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.323
Maybe I can find him.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.692
You going to drag him in here
kicking and screaming?

39:55.694 --> 39:59.129
If I have to.

39:59.131 --> 40:01.464
You're really going above
and beyond, Hank.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.567
That's what friends are for.

40:17.381 --> 40:20.851
Here you go.

40:20.853 --> 40:23.119
Hey! Cuppa.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.389
Cheers.

40:26.391 --> 40:27.791
See this, Casey?

40:27.793 --> 40:30.560
This right here's
what I love about fishing.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.696
Yeah.

40:32.698 --> 40:35.966
We haven't snagged one bite
since we got out here.

40:35.968 --> 40:38.635
Casey, fishing is not about
catching fish.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.204
Okay. But... they taste good.

40:41.206 --> 40:45.775
Yeah. See, to me, golf...

40:45.777 --> 40:48.011
golf is always just about golf.

40:48.013 --> 40:51.948
But <i>fishing... </i> fishing's about...

40:51.950 --> 40:54.684
clearing your head, you know?

40:54.686 --> 40:57.320
When I came out here,
I was running from something.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.688
And now?

40:58.690 --> 41:01.157
Now I know I need to face the music.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.227
Well, Jack,
can you wait to face the music

41:04.229 --> 41:06.263
until we've at least reeled in one tuna?

41:06.265 --> 41:08.498
Yeah. Yeah.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.268
- What about you, Casey?
- Hmm?

41:11.270 --> 41:13.169
What are you running from, huh?

41:13.171 --> 41:15.105
What's this South America all about?

41:15.107 --> 41:18.041
South America's about South America.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.743
I'm not running away,

41:19.745 --> 41:21.411
I'm running straight into my future.

41:21.413 --> 41:24.681
That's what I like about you, Casey.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.750
You're always one step ahead of me.

41:26.752 --> 41:30.620
Another time, another place?

41:30.622 --> 41:33.256
Another fishing hole.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.060
Hey, um, do you want a jacket?

41:37.062 --> 41:40.397
- I'm freezing.
- I'm okay.
