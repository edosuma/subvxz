WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.470
- It's been a while

00:02.570 --> 00:04.038
since we've done any, like,
strategy buying.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.506
We should have a strategy,
I think, today.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.876
- We're good
at the distraction one.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.312
Like, the misdirection.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.713
Like, we'll tell them--
we'll just make up

00:12.813 --> 00:14.182
nonsense stories and, like,

00:14.282 --> 00:16.184
maybe get them pumped
on the units we don't want.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.119
I like it.
- I'm in.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.453
- All right, yeah.
- Let's do it.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.289
- We've become really...

00:21.389 --> 00:22.823
- Boring.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.558
- Yeah, dull.
- Yeah, we're dull.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.094
You for sure.
I don't know--

00:26.194 --> 00:27.395
- Me, not so much, but...

00:30.964 --> 00:32.733
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:32.833 --> 00:35.002
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:35.103 --> 00:36.604
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:36.704 --> 00:38.506
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.840
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.175
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:41.275 --> 00:42.876
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:42.976 --> 00:44.412
- You shut your face.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.580
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.748
- We're back, baby!

00:51.819 --> 00:54.188
- Storage buyer etiquette:

00:54.288 --> 00:56.056
who wears gloves
when they go in their unit?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.525
- Me.
- I wear gloves.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.160
- I'm listening.
- I wear gloves

00:59.260 --> 01:00.794
so I don't have to keep
washing my hands.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.131
I, at once, was just like you.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.698
Didn't--no common sense,

01:04.798 --> 01:06.934
no rhyme or reason to what I do,
anything like that.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.769
- Uh-huh.
- But I've, uh,

01:08.869 --> 01:11.239
refined my process
over the years.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.940
You know, I've learned.
I've evolved.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.074
Hold on, I'll--
- No, no, no gloves.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.176
- No, no, no, man.
- No gloves.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.410
Gloves make you sensitive.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.411
- I'm gonna elevate
your game right now.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.679
I'll tell you what, man.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.880
- Oh, that's like
he's going doing, like, a...

01:19.980 --> 01:22.483
- The first pair
is on me, man.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.318
- It's like doctor's gloves.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.886
- You want a prostate exam
right now?

01:27.655 --> 01:29.223
- If they don't fit,
you must acquit.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.659
Cough.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.826
- They haven't been touched
in a while, man.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.162
Go ahead.
Hey, a hand's a hand.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.197
Oh, look, you guys
have the same hat on.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.731
Holy .
- Cool hat, Mary!

01:40.168 --> 01:41.402
- No, I already got some, Ivy,
but thanks.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.837
You know what she does?
She learns.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.038
- Do you wear gloves
when you go in a unit?

01:45.139 --> 01:46.039
- Prepared.
- She learned her lesson.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.107
- Whew.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.676
It's frickin'
already hot.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.312
It feels like H-E
double hockey sticks out here.

01:51.412 --> 01:54.715
These units better be heavenly.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.117
- Oh, my God, it is hat day.
What the ?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.220
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:59.320 --> 02:00.754
- That thing is huge.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.656
- It's a lady hat.
- It's a sombrero.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.458
- You beat up some lady
and take it?

02:04.558 --> 02:05.726
- All righty, guys,
thank you so much

02:05.826 --> 02:07.027
for coming out today
to StorAmerica

02:07.127 --> 02:08.262
here in Victorville.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.397
My name is Emily.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.664
I'm gonna be
your auctioneer today.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.799
Once I open the door,
you can't go in

02:11.899 --> 02:13.066
and you can't touch anything,

02:13.167 --> 02:14.568
but you will all get
a chance to look.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.870
Please look quickly, because
if you didn't realize it,

02:16.970 --> 02:18.071
it's 100 degrees today.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.640
I'm not gonna waste
any time.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.509
We're gonna keep moving on
and try and get done quickly.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.043
- Whoa!
A little domineering.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.645
- If you have cash in
your pocket, you can buy today.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.747
It's a cash-only auction.
If you're ready to go, so am I.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.748
Let's go!

02:28.849 --> 02:30.083
*

02:30.184 --> 02:31.219
- Okay, game plan.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.020
Game time, babe.
Get ready.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.589
Operation Distraction
starts now.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.590
- Hmm.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.791
- This is our moneymaker.

02:37.891 --> 02:38.859
- Here we go, guys.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.093
Got a 5x5.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.931
*

02:44.031 --> 02:45.199
- Oh, jeez.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.335
I'm looking for vintage-cool
treasures,

02:47.435 --> 02:48.769
but I don't think this is it.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.204
- That's a big sleeping bag
down there.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.539
I like that, but you know what?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.173
Not enough stuff for me.
- All right, I got...

02:53.274 --> 02:54.942
- That's a cool ice chest.
I've never seen one like that.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.310
- Speaking of ice chest.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.111
- It's warm up there.
- All right.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.080
We can put this online.
It's all small,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.849
so it's easy--
you can ship it, you know?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.351
The wine fridge,

03:03.451 --> 03:04.718
we can just put wine in that.
- I mean...

03:04.818 --> 03:06.554
- I think
our biggest competition

03:06.654 --> 03:07.855
in this is gonna be Ivy.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.323
Time for some misdirection.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.292
- All righty, guys.
What do you say to $100?

03:11.392 --> 03:12.493
How about 25?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.861
- Focus, focus.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.028
- I mean, tell me about it.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.430
30

03:17.965 --> 03:19.066
40.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.336
I feel like I sat in it,
but I don't remember.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.937
Did I sit in the chair?
$70.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.138
- 100 bucks!

03:26.240 --> 03:27.207
Got you.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.942
is this guy?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.345
And how dare he address me
by my first name?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.613
- 125, now.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.981
150!
- Right here.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.584
- Let him have it.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.918
- What do you think
of the new kid?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.287
I think he's a little obnoxious.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.488
- A little cocky.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.889
- Little too big
for his britches, huh?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.558
- Damn.
175?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.327
Anybody else?
175?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.961
Sold it to you, $160.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.196
Jarrod got it for $160.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.631
- Nicely done.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.965
- Our misdirection

03:52.065 --> 03:53.634
may have just misdirected us

03:53.734 --> 03:55.168
right in the right direction.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.904
What do you think?
Let's look real quick.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.038
- Nothing.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.039
- There's nothing in there.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.240
Unless there's money.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.009
- What the...

04:02.109 --> 04:03.544
- Nothing.
- We could fill it up

04:03.644 --> 04:04.878
with Kool-Aid
and put it in the backyard

04:04.978 --> 04:05.879
for the kids.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.147
- Probably worth 10 bucks.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.849
What else you got?
- Wine fridge.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.083
It looks pretty new.
- So it's probably worth...

04:10.183 --> 04:11.919
maybe 25 bucks?
- Love it.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.153
Let's see what's
in this box.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.555
Oh!
- Ooh, look at that.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.723
Everything's wrapped nice.
- It already looks good.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.024
It looks like it's
kitchen stuff.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.660
Irish coffee mug.
- Ooh, I like these ones.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.329
How about I scoot you
over here a little bit?

04:21.429 --> 04:22.530
Let's go here and grab that.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.731
We gotta get back
to this auction.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.732
- All right, all right.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.267
- Lantern, lantern...

04:27.368 --> 04:28.936
pump...
we could probably get,

04:29.036 --> 04:30.438
I don't know,
5 bucks apiece

04:30.538 --> 04:32.773
for these flashlights.
- It's basically all barware,

04:32.873 --> 04:34.342
it looks like.
- Have you found

04:34.442 --> 04:35.543
anything of value?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.311
- These are all sellable items.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.979
- People like this stuff.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.948
I think we can probably get
40 bucks for this bag.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.350
- There we go.
Let's move on.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.017
- These are cute.
- Yeah, the little fat ones.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.753
So we're at 85 bucks plus 40.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.054
We're almost even.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.556
- We gotta make at least

04:48.656 --> 04:49.557
40 bucks to make a profit.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.858
Oh, another tent.

04:50.958 --> 04:51.892
Probably 25 bucks.

04:51.992 --> 04:52.893
- Okay.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.127
- 10 bucks.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.796
- That's a yoga mat.
We could sell that.

04:55.896 --> 04:56.964
- 5 bucks.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.165
*

04:58.265 --> 04:59.833
A nice ice chest.
10 bucks.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.101
- Hey, dominoes.
- Dominoes!

05:01.201 --> 05:02.336
Oh, my God,
you know how much money

05:02.436 --> 05:03.571
I could make with those?

05:05.038 --> 05:06.474
This is fun.
- Hammer time.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.677
That's for hammering in
your tent stakes.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.945
Urine in a bottle, or...
- Dish soap.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.681
- I don't think
there's any value in there.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.149
- Okay.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.250
What is this?
- I don't know.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.686
Take it out.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.722
What is it?
Is it a clock?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.457
- No, it's a knife sharpener.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.793
- Yeah, look how cool that is.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.327
"Perfectly"--or I mean, sorry,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.962
"the perfect edge instantly."

05:29.062 --> 05:30.398
- That's--
- "Blankner's Knife Sharpener."

05:30.498 --> 05:32.299
'20s, maybe.
- We might have to

05:32.400 --> 05:33.667
have that thing checked out.
- I think so.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.436
- That thing's awesome.
- It's kind of neat.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.604
All right, what else you got?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.772
- TV stand.
It's a little banged up.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.007
We're gonna end up
just trashing it,

05:40.107 --> 05:41.241
'cause we're selling
smalls right now.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.443
- All right.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.477
And then whatever
this thing is worth.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.778
- And whatever that's worth.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.179
- Our cut in this locker
isn't great,

05:46.279 --> 05:48.916
so that sharpener better
carve out a better profit.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.818
- I don't know what it is
or how it works,

05:50.918 --> 05:54.354
but I can tell you that I'm
probably gonna keep it.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.289
- No, you're not.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.260
- Come on, let's go!

06:00.360 --> 06:01.762
Two more units!

06:03.464 --> 06:05.466
All righty, guys,
got a 5x15.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.235
*

06:08.335 --> 06:09.403
Wow.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.871
Ooh, I got it in my mouth.
- Ew.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.139
- It got a little gritty
in there.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.007
- Oh, that's what she said.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.275
*

06:15.375 --> 06:17.478
- Ew.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.112
- Oh, my God, it's...
- Oh, my God.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.113
It smells like poop.
- Oh, my God.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.749
It smells terrible.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.083
Oh, God.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.618
That just says it all.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.320
My God, so sick.
I'm out.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.222
Uh

06:29.322 --> 06:31.291
Uh-uh, that means no for me.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.693
- Hold on.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.094
*

06:34.194 --> 06:35.663
- It stinks.
It's bad.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.764
- I don't think it's worth it.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.265
- Nope.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.399
Pressure cooker.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.468
- Nope.
- Okay, let's move on.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.102
Okay.
- Thanks.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.938
- Nothing jumps out at me.

06:45.038 --> 06:45.939
This likes a--whew.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.575
*

06:47.675 --> 06:49.376
Ugh, look like an apartment
that was chucked in

06:49.477 --> 06:50.511
and left for me to come buy.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.079
When it comes to storage units,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.414
bid with your eyes,
not your nose.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.383
- All righty, guys,
here we go.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.985
Another locker here
with some furniture in it.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.653
- Ivy, that's you.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.121
'Cause you like getting
your hands dirty.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.523
30.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.524
- Make a move.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.358
- Here.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.894
- 30, and 35, sir.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.830
And now 40.
- He told me this morning,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.031
that he thought
you were a little bitch

07:11.131 --> 07:12.132
and you would never
bid against him.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.467
That's what he told me.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.635
That's what he said

07:14.735 --> 07:15.969
- I--that's what he told me.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.905
40.
- He doesn't usually

07:18.005 --> 07:19.507
say "bitch," either.
That's why it was surprising.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.908
50.
- I was shocked.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.209
We didn't want this locker.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.877
We're just messing
with this kid for fun.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.412
- Yeah, I heard the same thing.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.080
- Or something like,
"He ain't ."

07:27.180 --> 07:28.415
50.
- I'd be a bitch

07:28.516 --> 07:29.650
if I bought that.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.851
- That's not what Ivy thinks.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.521
- 65, 75, and 80.
$80, now.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.290
85, now 90.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.792
Now 90.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.661
And 100.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.896
And now 110.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.031
110 now.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.232
- What the...

07:45.332 --> 07:46.600
Oh, he's totally clocked out.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.303
Sold it to you, $110,
to Ivy.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.139
- The heat, stinky locker--

07:52.239 --> 07:53.707
nothing keeps me
from making money.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.109
Close!

07:56.209 --> 07:57.811
It wanna go home with me now.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.280
- Hey. Mary.
- Justin.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.516
- This new guy seems
a little cocky,

08:02.616 --> 08:03.851
so I wanna let him know
what's up

08:03.951 --> 08:05.285
before it gets out of hand.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.988
So my advice to you is,
for the first round,

08:08.088 --> 08:09.657
with all this crowd?
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.192
- You better not bid anyone up.
- I'll try not to.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.061
- I'm gonna have
no respect for you.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.364
- All righty, guys,
last unit of the day,

08:17.464 --> 08:19.232
and we can all go back home
in the air-conditioning.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.271
*

08:24.371 --> 08:25.472
- Boxes...

08:25.573 --> 08:27.808
with, it looks like,
a lot of toys.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.176
Something--ooh, Comic-Con.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.578
That's a good sign right there.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.814
This unit might be full
of vintage toy stuff,

08:33.914 --> 08:35.382
so I'm in.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.051
- Eh, not a lot of stuff,

08:38.151 --> 08:39.286
but, you know, right now,
this is kind of

08:39.386 --> 08:40.387
what I like to buy.

08:40.487 --> 08:41.388
- Look at this.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.256
This is the spring of a car.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.491
- That's weird.
- I bet you

08:44.592 --> 08:45.759
there's a lot of
car parts in here.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.360
If it goes for
a couple hundred bucks.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.729
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.230
- Hey, new guy, you gonna
buy a unit today or what?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.398
Or did you just
come here to look?

08:51.498 --> 08:52.700
- I'll buy it if you move it
for me.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.002
- Last unit of the day--
saved the best for last.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.336
And what do you say there?
200 bucks.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.504
- What's that--whoa!

08:57.605 --> 08:59.039
- What the...

08:59.139 --> 09:00.040
Now I got 250.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.108
- Ugh.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.475
- I got 300, I got 350.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.944
I got 400.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.512
- That guy's bidding
back there.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.914
- 500 now.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.181
550, and now 600.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.050
And 650. Now 700.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.020
- I am not gonna let
this whippersnapper outbid me.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.655
- This new guy,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.056
he's trying to be slick.
- Uh-huh.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.658
Did he bid?

09:17.758 --> 09:18.792
Mary, 750?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.193
- Get in there.
- I'm getting in!

09:20.293 --> 09:21.361
- This is your unit.
- That new guy--be slick.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.965
775? 775.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.533
- It's the new guy.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.068
- She missed your bid--
there you go.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.569
- Yeah.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.971
- Damn.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.472
- 825, 825 now.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.808
850.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.977
- All right.
- Can't let that guy win.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.211
- Nope, can't.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.546
- Hit it.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.716
Sold it to Mary, $850.
- Yes.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.917
- Whoo!

09:44.017 --> 09:45.385
- Burn, new guy!

09:45.485 --> 09:47.120
It was an arms race...

09:47.220 --> 09:48.956
and I have the bigger guns.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.491
- Thank you guys so much
for coming out today

09:51.591 --> 09:52.826
and sticking with us.
I know it was hot.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.327
Please come and find me
in the office

09:54.427 --> 09:55.796
and pay your bills
before you leave.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.064
And see you next time.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.267
- Hah!
Who got the locker?

10:00.367 --> 10:01.869
- You totally overpaid
on that unit.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.671
- I don't think so.
Maybe you should just come on by

10:03.771 --> 10:06.506
and I'll show you what
a winner's locker looks like.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.075
- You know, I'm very interested
to see how much money you lost,

10:08.175 --> 10:09.576
so why not?
- Deal.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.012
Show you how much
you are a loser

10:12.112 --> 10:13.647
and I'm a winner.
- Ha!

10:13.747 --> 10:15.182
- Time for school, kiddo.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.519
Okay.
Ready?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.954
You do this all the time, right?
- I don't think you can

10:21.054 --> 10:22.555
reach this high.
You wanna try?

10:22.656 --> 10:24.257
- No, you can go right ahead.
- Okay, all right, got you.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.558
*

10:25.659 --> 10:26.927
- All right, first box.
- Bunch of toys.

10:27.027 --> 10:27.995
- This whole bucket's
5 bucks, maybe.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.197
Ooh, that's cool.
- No motor.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.298
- Maybe 10 bucks for it.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.133
Clothes...crusty plush.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.735
- If I see mattresses

10:34.835 --> 10:36.704
or any sort of, like, towel,

10:36.804 --> 10:38.305
it's called "crusty plush."

10:38.405 --> 10:40.841
*

10:40.941 --> 10:42.743
Well, this is what I saw
from the get-go.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.977
- There you go.
- And I thought maybe

10:44.077 --> 10:46.079
this unit would be
full of collectibles.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.081
- Ah, there's something.
- Some tools.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.449
Maybe 5 bucks for this, though.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.752
- DVD player.
- Maybe 10 bucks for it.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.620
- Ooh, an old Atari.
- Ooh, that's...

10:53.721 --> 10:54.955
- Vintage!

10:55.055 --> 10:56.456
Except...great.
- Yeah.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.457
- It says Flashback.
- Yeah.

10:57.557 --> 10:58.658
- 2011.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.327
Dang it.
Maybe 10 bucks.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.561
A little vacuum.
- Little vacuum.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.930
- And it's pink!
Cute.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.264
5 bucks for this little vac.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
Ooh.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.735
What is that?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.472
What is that?

11:12.572 --> 11:14.241
- Now we're talking.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.009
This is freaking cool.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.745
This looks like
a hanging speaker.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.579
- There's two of them.
- They're vintage-y looking.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.281
They look like they were,
like, studio.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.783
Like Studio 64.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.985
- Let's put this to the side.
- Totally.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.920
Ew, crusty plush.
- Aww, look.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.222
Here you go, Mary.
- Frickin' trash.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.690
- Got some pads here.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.962
Trash.
This is not looking good at all.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.429
Who bid me up?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.698
It was that Ivy guy, wasn't it?
- God.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.300
- Got some car speakers here.
- Are they in good--

11:40.400 --> 11:41.668
I mean--
- Yeah, they're good.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.403
- 20 bucks.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.738
- I'll take it at this point,
right?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.573
This could bring in some money.
30 bucks.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.776
Those look nice.
I say 20 bucks a pop.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.910
- Yeah.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.711
- Some old phones.
- iPhone 4.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.712
That's, like, $50.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.849
- Electronics.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.785
So you--okay, that's good.
So you know all about this.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.119
Do you know what this stuff is?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.888
'Cause I have no idea.
- For the car radio.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.122
- I have no idea.
- Like, $15 of these things.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.323
- Okay.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.625
Well, I guess this rookie
has some skills.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.560
- Looks like you might actually
have a printer in here.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.629
- Ooh, is it in the box--yes!

12:09.729 --> 12:10.964
- Brand-new.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.699
- Now we're talking.
50 bucks, probably.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.303
Great.
It felt so heavy.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.637
Straightener.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.506
It actually--oh, my God,
it's a crimping iron.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.609
Amazing.
This is vintage.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.312
This is, like, the kind of stuff
that I sell on my website,

12:25.412 --> 12:26.646
'cause it's quirky
and it's funky.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.281
I'm gonna say 15 bucks.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.817
- Yeah.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.219
For sure, 'cause this
is history right here, okay?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.954
He may know about electronics,

12:34.054 --> 12:35.488
but Justin doesn't know "crimp"

12:35.588 --> 12:36.857
about what I sell!

12:36.957 --> 12:38.725
That bike looks nice.
- You got the frame here.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.493
- Those tires go with it.
- Yeah.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.329
- So, I mean, it's in
pretty good condition, right?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.530
50 bucks, maybe?
- 50 bucks.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.932
- Yeah.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.199
- These tires are--
- That's a nice little rim

12:46.299 --> 12:47.467
on that thing.
Are they all like that?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.768
- Yeah, actually,
you have a set.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.503
- Yes!
Oh, my God, racing!

12:50.603 --> 12:52.405
I know that these rim thingies
have gotta be

12:52.505 --> 12:54.741
at least $250 each,
right?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.309
Heck yeah!
- You got your money back

12:56.409 --> 12:58.245
just in the rims alone.
- Yes! I knew it!

12:58.345 --> 12:59.980
See, I knew it all along.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.414
- It's 'cause I was here
for good luck.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.216
- No, it was just because
I have master skills

13:03.316 --> 13:04.751
at this stuff.
That's all.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.053
Oh, okay.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.793
Oh, it stinks.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.129
I'm in the business
of turning stank into bank,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.731
and business
is about to get good.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.167
Oh, wow.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.903
Twin mattress in super,
super clean condition.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.073
Box spring and mattress?
$30 pair.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.041
Very nice--jewelry.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.244
Jewelry there, jewelry there,
jewelry there.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.881
This whole box of jewelry
right here, 200 bucks.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.048
Whoo!

13:35.148 --> 13:37.284
That's why I buy units--
right there!

13:37.384 --> 13:39.686
The rest of you,
you don't gotta be worth a lot--

13:39.786 --> 13:41.021
just worth something.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.023
Folding table--
no matter where you go,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.324
you get 20 bucks for these.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.060
Cool boxes.
I love boxes.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.128
Let's see what we got here.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.530
Ooh.
Oh, this look like

13:50.630 --> 13:52.099
one of them CPR baby thingies.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.433
Looks kind of freaky too.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.434
So I guess this is--
has something to do

13:54.534 --> 13:55.468
with working on babies.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.070
Maybe health, maybe CPR.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.873
But this could be my ticket
to making a lot of money

13:59.973 --> 14:00.874
instead of a little money.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.043
Let me put this over here.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.678
Man, the deeper I get,
the worser it smells in here.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.714
I think they left a refrigerator
with food in it.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.686
Found the smell.
There it is!

14:13.786 --> 14:14.988
Yes, sir.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.125
*

14:18.225 --> 14:19.326
Now, at one time,

14:19.426 --> 14:21.694
that was strawberry
fancy dessert.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.330
Now it look like
a dead squirrel.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.798
The smell is now gone.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.671
Now I'm pretty sure
that I can deal with anything.

14:31.771 --> 14:32.739
Now--ooh.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.943
Another box like that.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.678
I need to close my mouth
when I work.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.879
Blood pressure tester.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.581
I get good money for these.
15 bucks.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.183
15 bucks.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.718
More jewelry--at least 20 bucks.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.621
Nice box of clothes--20 bucks.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.891
Lots and lots of pots--$40.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.093
I'll get 10 bucks for that.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.328
Oh, iPad!

14:55.428 --> 14:56.329
Damn.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.131
I'm blinded!
Ooh!

14:58.231 --> 14:59.366
Can't see a thing...

14:59.466 --> 15:00.733
but I can feel 100 bucks.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.771
Whoo!
How do you like me now?

15:04.871 --> 15:06.940
More jewelry.
The mother lode!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.041
200 bucks on this box.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.043
Looks like some more

15:10.143 --> 15:11.144
of that baby stuff--

15:11.244 --> 15:13.046
same kind of case, same name.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.081
Well, if that's the little baby,

15:14.181 --> 15:15.448
this is probably the giant baby.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.284
Open!

15:17.384 --> 15:19.619
Whoo!
It ain't no giant baby.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.221
How would you like to kiss
that woman every morning?

15:23.223 --> 15:24.124
Sorry.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.592
I'm just working on my CPR.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.295
Well, this right here,
I'm gonna put with that one,

15:28.395 --> 15:29.963
because just by
the way they feel,

15:30.063 --> 15:31.965
they're not cheap.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.766
You gotta go deep
to get the good stuff.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.802
That's deep and high.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.337
Pow!

15:37.437 --> 15:38.938
I think there's
a teenage boy here.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.107
It actually kind of
creeps me out.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.108
I feel kind of weird,

15:41.208 --> 15:42.542
but it is what it is.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.277
You never, ever, ever know
what you're gonna find

15:44.377 --> 15:45.979
in a storage unit.
Look at this unit.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.914
It stinks in here, but when
there's money to be made,

15:48.015 --> 15:49.249
I don't smell a thing.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.084
And I'm gonna take
all three of these guys

15:51.184 --> 15:52.852
to get them checked out,
to see if I'm just

15:52.952 --> 15:56.323
smelling my riches
or smelling the stink.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.628
- Let me get the door.
- Oh, thanks.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.563
- There you go.
Ding-dong.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.831
- We're at Ross Cutlery to see

16:04.931 --> 16:06.066
if Richard and Jennifer
can tell us

16:06.166 --> 16:07.634
how much our knife sharpener
is worth.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.303
- Actually, we're here
at Ross Cutlery

16:10.403 --> 16:11.704
so I can get a new blade.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.274
This is the contraption
that we talked about.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.076
Knife sharpener, we think it is.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.178
- Mm-hmm, it is.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.414
- Well, it's very old--
probably from the 1920s.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.083
- Wow.
- It's missing some parts.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.551
- Yeah, both sides.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.818
- I was wondering how
they sharpened.

16:25.918 --> 16:26.886
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I was like, "Hmm..."

16:28.088 --> 16:29.489
- You'd put your stones
in here,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.691
where the springs are.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.993
- Yeah, and then you'd have them
all the way across.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.362
And then, when you get
all the stones in...

16:35.462 --> 16:36.829
- So it crisscrossed.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.265
- You would pull
the knife through.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.699
- And then you could
adjust this side?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.534
- Yeah, this is part
of the whole adjustment.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.070
- Yeah.
- Does it hurt the value

16:43.170 --> 16:44.271
to be missing the stones?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.273
- No, stones would be
easy to get.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.441
Or interchangeable.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.809
Huh.
- But it's really nice.

16:49.909 --> 16:50.810
- Okay.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.080
With all that being said...

16:53.180 --> 16:54.447
what do you think
this thing's worth?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.316
- In this condition...

16:58.818 --> 17:00.387
Probably about $250.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.654
- Mm-hmm, great.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.156
- Better than a poke in the eye.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.059
- Definitely, yeah.
With a sharp knife.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.061
What can I get for $250?
- Oh, let me show you.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.762
- Let's look!
- All right.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.431
- There goes our profit.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.732
Maybe Jarrod could take a stab

17:12.832 --> 17:14.301
at getting us a better locker
next time.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.169
- Come on, I think
we got a good deal.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.170
Let's go.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.674
- Hello!
- Allee, hey!

17:21.774 --> 17:24.277
- I'm good, hey!

17:24.377 --> 17:25.978
- My brother Poe is in town
from Texas,

17:26.079 --> 17:27.214
so I'm taking him to visit

17:27.314 --> 17:28.881
my good friend Allee Willis.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.951
She's an award-winning artist
and the Queen of Kitsch.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.786
- These...

17:33.886 --> 17:35.722
are popularized
in the space age.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.723
- Yeah.
- Otherwise known

17:36.823 --> 17:38.158
as mid-century modern.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.160
- Now, mid-century modern--
what exactly does that mean?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.529
I hear it all the time.
- Mid-century modern means

17:42.629 --> 17:44.231
the atomic '50s:

17:44.331 --> 17:47.200
1948 to 1962.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.668
People debate about the years.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.070
I'm the queen of the atomic age.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.640
- Those are the years.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.376
These were more early '70s.
- Okay.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.678
- There were two prime
manufacturers--

17:58.778 --> 18:01.781
Grundig, and then
JVC also made them.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.351
These are the cheap knockoffs.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.119
- Dang it.
- And you can tell

18:06.219 --> 18:08.388
because of the woven material.
- Yeah.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.722
- This would've been metal,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.291
and it's plastic.
- Yeah.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.792
- So...

18:12.892 --> 18:14.026
they are worth...

18:16.596 --> 18:17.497
70 bucks.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.931
Dang it!

18:19.031 --> 18:20.233
- Dang it.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.634
- I mean, they're
in great condition...

18:21.734 --> 18:22.869
- Yeah, they're cool.
- For what they are.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.304
- And if I want them
to make money,

18:24.404 --> 18:26.473
I'm not gonna make 'em
off these.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.209
- If you found a total sucker...

18:29.309 --> 18:30.610
I do know
some suckers.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.412
- That's who you should go for.
- Got you.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.983
- Heart N Soul.
All right, here I am.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.018
Sounds like a blues album.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.120
I'm taking my dummies
to Sergio Castrellon,

18:41.221 --> 18:42.889
owner of Heart N Soul CPR.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.257
- Let's see what you got.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.858
This is what we call
a simulator--

18:45.958 --> 18:48.961
what they utilize in,
like, EMT schools.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.263
- Fake baby.
- Fake babies,

18:50.363 --> 18:52.532
to make sure that
they're able to breathe,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.335
to make sure that we can
compress the little chest.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.471
- 1970s or so,

18:58.571 --> 18:59.939
so it's pretty old.
- I'd say,

19:00.039 --> 19:01.274
"It don't look a day
over one to me."

19:02.542 --> 19:03.543
- So let's look
at your next item.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.977
- All right.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.879
So we got
a full-size manikin.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.250
This is what we called
a "Resusci Junior."

19:10.350 --> 19:12.552
These simulators are made
by the company

19:12.652 --> 19:15.855
who was the founder
and leader of manikins,

19:15.955 --> 19:17.824
Laerdal,
a company out of Norway.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.892
You got your lung cavity.
Okay.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.261
You can compress the chest.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.595
*

19:22.695 --> 19:24.464
So it looks like it's in good,
working condition.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.266
They took pretty good care
of it.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.268
- All right.
Well, the last

19:28.368 --> 19:31.338
but definitely not least...
open sesame.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.707
- So this is what we call
the "Resusci Annie," okay?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.243
- "Resusci Annie."
- We open her up,

19:36.343 --> 19:37.410
look inside here.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.180
So she's got her lung bag.
Good spring.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.450
You don't have the arms
for the manikin.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.751
- Oh, yeah.
I didn't even notice that.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.119
- Other than that,
she looks to be in good shape.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.521
A little worn, little used,

19:48.621 --> 19:50.257
but, again, she's...
- 40 years.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.424
- 40 years.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.925
- I don't like her name, though.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.294
We gotta change the name.
Annie's kind of, like, boring.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.395
- Okay, what do you want to--
- Like, Candy.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.796
Okay, we'll call her Candy.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.365
All right.
- What I really came here

19:58.465 --> 20:00.633
for is, I need to
resuscitate my pockets.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.502
On all three of these guys,

20:02.602 --> 20:03.770
what can I make?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.374
- I say you got
about $600 worth

20:07.474 --> 20:08.675
of equipment here.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.510
- Whoo!
Thanks, Doc.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.544
$600?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.012
That's sweeter than candy.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.781
This unit smelled horrible,

20:14.881 --> 20:16.015
but that scent
didn't follow me in here.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.216
If it would've,
we'd have to go outside.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.351
- Uh-oh.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.552
*

20:19.652 --> 20:20.820
- Still smells good.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.356
male narrator:
Ivy Calvin was able

20:23.456 --> 20:25.458
to breathe life
into his wallet,

20:25.558 --> 20:29.095
making over $1,100
with his CPR dummies.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.399
Mary Padian schooled the new
guy on how things were done

20:32.499 --> 20:36.569
and turned up her profit
to 535 smackers.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.139
And Jarrod and Brandi
would've made 265 bucks,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.374
but a big knife...

20:42.475 --> 20:43.576
Is way cooler.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.612
- So the best way
to do a compression

20:45.712 --> 20:48.147
is to do compressions
to the tune of "Stayin' Alive."

20:49.248 --> 20:50.149
- Oh, I got that!

20:50.249 --> 20:51.318
I know that song.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.585
Heard it on the way here,
I think.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.253
Let me think.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.158
*

20:59.258 --> 21:00.960
Like that?
- Something like that.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.630
Ivy!
Thank you for saving my life.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.465
You're welcome, Candy. Anytime.
