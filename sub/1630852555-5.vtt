00:01.262 --> 00:03.090
<i>Last time on</i> Naomi...

00:03.133 --> 00:05.570
<i>You said that you adopted me</i> <i>
someplace on the East Coast.</i>

00:05.614 --> 00:07.485
<i>But you really found me here.</i>

00:07.529 --> 00:10.314
If this UFO hunt
is important to you,
it's important to us.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.534
Hope I'm not interrupting.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.275
Who are you?
What do you want?

00:14.318 --> 00:16.755
I'm here
to take you back.
Earth-29.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.931
<i>I believe he was</i> <i>
a bounty hunter.</i>

00:18.975 --> 00:20.542
<i>His arrival might be tied</i> <i>
to the emergence</i> <i>
of your powers.</i>

00:21.630 --> 00:23.371
This Q is for Qyeala.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.589
What does it mean?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.417
It's the name of
the one I loved.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.767
Does this mean you figured out
what you really want?

00:28.811 --> 00:29.855
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:31.118 --> 00:32.728
Favorite ice cream?

00:32.771 --> 00:34.425
Easy. Mint chocolate chip.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.514
What?

00:36.558 --> 00:38.212
No. It tastes like toothpaste.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.433
Yeah, it kind of does.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.914
Favorite place you've lived?

00:44.957 --> 00:49.266
Tokyo. Definitely.
I love the people and the food.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.573
That's where I got
my first Superman comic.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.314
It's also where you first
learned how to skateboard.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.533
How do you know that?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.275
I'm a good listener?

00:58.319 --> 00:59.711
Are you sure you're
not a stalker?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.628
Uh, favorite place
you've lived?

01:03.672 --> 01:05.500
Oh, that's tough.

01:05.543 --> 01:10.809
Seoul was dope, but I think
Germany is my favorite.

01:10.853 --> 01:14.509
When my mom was on leave,
we would take these weekend
trips all over Europe.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.687
France, Switzerland, Spain.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.384
I've always wanted
to go to Spain.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.559
Oh, we'll go some day.

01:22.734 --> 01:23.779
To Spain?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.216
Damn, Nathan.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.783
Save something for the second date.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.874
So where to next?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.310
<i>Let me tell you</i> <i>
why you're here.</i>

01:35.182 --> 01:37.227
<i>You're here because</i> <i>
you know something.</i>

01:37.271 --> 01:40.317
<i>What you know,</i> <i>
you can't explain,</i> <i>
but you feel it.</i>

01:41.710 --> 01:44.104
<i>You felt it your entire life.</i>

01:44.147 --> 01:45.714
<i>That there's something wrong</i> <i>
with the world.</i>

01:45.757 --> 01:48.673
<i>You don't know what it is,</i> <i>
but it's there.</i>

01:48.717 --> 01:53.809
<i>Like a splinter in your mind</i> <i>
driving you mad.</i>

01:53.852 --> 01:55.985
<i>It is this feeling</i> <i>
that has brought you to me.</i>

02:12.654 --> 02:16.788
Meditation is not about controlling
your thoughts.

02:16.832 --> 02:20.183
Even if those thoughts
are painful,

02:20.227 --> 02:22.272
do not fight them.

02:22.316 --> 02:25.188
Why be a sheep
when you can be a wolf?

02:33.892 --> 02:36.982
<i>I spent my whole life</i> <i>
imagining my birth parents.</i>

02:37.026 --> 02:39.028
But you both knew
this whole time.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.770
There are two ways
to deal with fear.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.728
You fight it or you face it.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.730
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.036
Afraid you don't have a choice.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.273
Congratulations.

03:06.316 --> 03:10.364
You just completed
your first meditation practice.

03:10.407 --> 03:11.974
How long was that?

03:12.017 --> 03:12.888
Ten minutes.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.630
Felt like ten years.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.719
That's completely normal.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.203
Being alone with your thoughts,
can be difficult.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.206
It takes practice.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.906
I think I prefer boxing.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.301
So do I.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.954
Kept having all these thoughts,

03:36.738 --> 03:37.739
memories...

03:39.393 --> 03:41.308
I couldn't stop them.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.657
You shouldn't try to.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.399
That is the point
of meditation.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.837
I've also been having
some dreams.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.231
What kind of dreams?

03:54.364 --> 03:58.847
I'm back on the soccer field,
with the bounty hunter.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.764
And he's coming towards me
and I I try to run,
but I can't.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.114
He just keeps coming
closer and closer.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.551
But in my dream,

04:09.292 --> 04:10.511
you don't show up.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.992
You had a traumatic experience.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.998
Fear is a very
powerful emotion.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.305
I've never been
that scared before.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.177
it will get better.

04:26.614 --> 04:27.789
I promise.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.100

04:36.363 --> 04:38.408
Meditation is no joke.

04:38.452 --> 04:41.150
Who would've guessed you'd be
so emotionally involved.

04:41.193 --> 04:44.240
I'm really looking forward
to just getting away
from everything

04:44.284 --> 04:45.807
for a weekend at Shadow Ridge.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.330
I'd hoped
your leadership retreat

04:47.374 --> 04:49.419
would involve less camping
and more glamping.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.768
I love camping.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.335
The trees, the lake,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.598
and at night, you can see
thousands of stars.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.426
Babe, I've never seen
someone so happy

04:56.470 --> 04:59.168
about a week with bears
and no cell phone service.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.170
This weekend is about fun.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.303
No bounty hunters, no powers.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.956
I can just be
a normal teenager.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.306
I'm not sure
it works like that.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.263
What's up, Nathan?

05:10.484 --> 05:12.921
I can't believe
you kissed Nathan.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.358
I'm so loving this strong
female lead for you.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.535
I've been thinking
about our first date
when we watched <i>The Matrix.</i>

05:18.579 --> 05:20.058
It's like you never broke up.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.712
He wants to ride together
on the way up.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.151
I am so shipping this.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.810
Miss McDuffie, Miss Peters,
you're both in jeep number six.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.812
There's assigned seating?

05:34.856 --> 05:36.640
True leadership
requires getting out of
your comfort zone.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.255
Hey, jeep buddy.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.214
Twist.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.171
I got this.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.130

Hi.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.585
You think this place has
mint chip ice-cream?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.370
If not, I want my money back.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.459
Welcome Porta Swango Juniors...

06:12.502 --> 06:15.244
To camp Shadow Ridge.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.942
You have been chosen
to visit Shadow Ridge

06:17.986 --> 06:20.423
because you are
the leaders of tomorrow.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.599
Now how about we show
you all around?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.993
Whoo! Right this way.

<i>♪ Everybody 'round me elevated,</i> <i>

06:27.256 --> 06:29.998
Our main cabin is home base
for the camp.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.783
Every morning starts there
with breakfast.

06:32.827 --> 06:38.310
Also, sorry to disappoint,
but we do not have
a co-ed dorm situation.

06:38.354 --> 06:41.313
Boys on one side,
girls on the other,

06:41.357 --> 06:44.055
chaperones in between.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.275
The only tweets
you'll be getting this weekend

06:46.318 --> 06:50.018
will be from actual birds.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.803
All of this leading up
to our final night of camp,

06:52.847 --> 06:55.327
where we'll all head off
into the woods

06:55.371 --> 06:58.766
to pitch our tents
for a true camping experience.

06:58.809 --> 07:04.946
And, as always,
there's the fire pit
for s'mores under the stars.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.470
The cabins you'll be
sleeping in tonight

07:07.514 --> 07:10.995
were built over
a hundred years ago
to house the loggers

07:11.039 --> 07:13.041
who worked in these woods.

07:13.084 --> 07:17.175
Including one who spent
only one season here,

07:17.219 --> 07:19.482
we like to call him...

07:19.526 --> 07:22.485
- Moonshine Jimmy.
- Moonshine Jimmy.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.400
Hey, no spoilers.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.924
Now, Jimmy, he liked to drink.

07:26.968 --> 07:30.362
He even brewed
his own moonshine.

07:30.406 --> 07:34.932
But one fateful night,
a night very much,

07:35.933 --> 07:37.935
like this one.

07:37.979 --> 07:43.941
Jimmy started drinking
and didn't stop
until he'd lost his mind.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.988
Some people think Jimmy's
moonshine batch was bad.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.688
Others say he was so drunk,

07:51.732 --> 07:54.778
he thought
he was felling trees.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.563
All we know for sure

07:56.606 --> 07:58.913
is that once
his moonshine was gone,

08:00.044 --> 08:02.569
Jimmy picked up his axe,

08:02.612 --> 08:07.138
and slaughtered every
single logger at the camp!

08:07.182 --> 08:08.270
Classic!

08:09.924 --> 08:13.797
Moonshine Jimmy's spirit
never left these woods.

08:13.841 --> 08:18.236
Once the moon is up,
you can still hear him,

08:19.063 --> 08:20.369
wandering...

08:22.458 --> 08:23.503
Did you hear that?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.636
So late at night,

08:26.680 --> 08:28.943
if you hear footsteps,

08:28.986 --> 08:30.901
there's only one thing
you can do.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.168
Oh, my God.

08:37.212 --> 08:40.345
Wow. 11 out of ten.
Would be scared
to death again.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.746
Dr. McDuffie,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.052
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.793
Pleasure's all mine, sir.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.535
So you're the one to thank
for all those dinners alone.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.667
Don't tell Greg.
I sometimes enjoy them.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.583
I've called you in here

09:00.627 --> 09:01.845
because you are the best
at what you do.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.458
My team recovered an artifact.

09:06.502 --> 09:10.027
I believe the markings
etched onto it are
an unknown language.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.727
I've never seen
glyphs like this.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.425
I'd be shocked if you had.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.559
We believe they are
extraterrestrial in origin.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.214
You mean aliens?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.652
Now you know why
I've kept your husband
so busy lately.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.612
I haven't seen this image
in our archives, sir.

09:29.656 --> 09:33.355
That's because we recently
discovered the artifact.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.772
I didn't scare you, did I?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
Nah, uh...

10:01.644 --> 10:03.298
I just thought girls
were supposed to be
in the girl's cabin.

10:08.738 --> 10:12.220
I was, uh,
kind of hoping we could talk,

10:13.438 --> 10:15.702
like, for real.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.747
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Is everything okay?

10:19.314 --> 10:20.924
It's great,

10:20.968 --> 10:23.710
the kiss,
hanging out,

10:24.493 --> 10:25.407
all of it.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.456
That's the problem.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.895
That doesn't sound
like a problem.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.856
Everything was great
last time, too.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.034
And you kind of just
broke up with me,

10:44.078 --> 10:45.775
and I never understood why.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.697
Nathan, someone's coming.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.707
Anthony?

11:08.102 --> 11:09.538
Are you okay? What happened?

11:09.581 --> 11:12.367
I saw... I saw
Moonshine Jimmy.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.290
- Hi.
- Hi, Naomi.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.039
How are you feeling?

11:32.082 --> 11:34.258
Better.

11:34.302 --> 11:39.263
They think it was allergies,
but, uh, it was definitely
not allergies.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.353
What happened out there?

11:42.397 --> 11:45.835
I don't really remember.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.925
I was reading in this book
about how you can apparently

11:48.969 --> 11:50.840
see Venus on really
clear nights.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.669
So I snuck out.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.889
Uh, I was hoping to get
a better view from the peak

11:55.932 --> 12:00.937
and then, I heard something
or someone,

12:00.981 --> 12:07.074
and then I saw this light.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.511
Like the...
the rocks and the trees,

12:09.554 --> 12:13.820
- were glowing blue.
- Like bioluminescence?

12:13.863 --> 12:16.344
No, I wasn't near any water.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.259
Plus the color was all wrong.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.957
But the...
But the weirdest thing
was that whatever it was,

12:21.001 --> 12:23.873
it made me feel dizzy.

12:27.529 --> 12:32.752
I got turned around
and that's when I saw you
and Nathan.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.105
Who could have been out there?

12:38.148 --> 12:40.411
That's what I'm
going to find out.

12:40.455 --> 12:44.938
And I was hoping that
you might help me.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.374
Of course, I'll help.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.419
- I'm in.
- Yeah?

12:48.463 --> 12:49.507
Yeah.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.904
A ghost hunt? In the woods?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.993
I thought we were going
canoeing later?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.952
We will.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.475
You don't have to
help with this, Nathan,

13:00.518 --> 13:01.693
and we can catch up later.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.739
No, I'm totally in.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.567
There's plenty
of time for canoes.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.743
So where do we start?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.093
Anthony said he overheard
one of the nurses

13:10.137 --> 13:12.443
saying something like this
has happened here before.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.488
So we're in a sequel.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.098
Great.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.404
There's always way more death
than the original.

13:18.885 --> 13:23.019
My goodness, ladies,
I've had my actual water break
and didn't scream like that.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.805
They're probably just on edge
from what happened to Anthony.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.458
It's not like that's
happened before, right?

13:27.502 --> 13:29.286
No. Well, not to a camper.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.593
So it happened
to someone on staff.

13:31.636 --> 13:35.162
You know, I did hear about
a part timer, but that was
before my time here.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.686
- How long ago was that?
- About six months ago.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.123
She was a researcher
who used the camp
as a home base.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.386
- Kind of a loner.
- Hmm.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.433
- What was their name?
- Belinda. It's a sad story.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.609
That's how I knew
you had allergies.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.611
- Same thing happened to her.
- No way it was allergies.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.657
She had a mental break
for sure. Left one day,
never came back.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.834
She was always out there
in the forest alone.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.879
That's what isolation
will do to the human psyche.

13:56.923 --> 14:00.056
I'm not supposed to say this,
but I think it's a cover up.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
They know
Moonshine Jimmy's real.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.495
That's why no one goes
to her cabin anymore.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.454
And where, exactly,
is her cabin?

14:06.497 --> 14:07.629
It's just outside of camp.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.765
Now don't you wait too long
before you come back
and see me.

14:13.809 --> 14:14.984
Have a good day.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.037
I used to have
a bike like this.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.342
When I lived overseas.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
How much?

14:30.391 --> 14:31.609
It's not for sale.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.619
You could've been
more discreet.

14:41.663 --> 14:44.579
And you could have told me
about your visit
from the bounty hunter.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.887
I didn't realize
I had to check in with you
about my movements.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.063
You do when it concerns Naomi.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.892
None of this would have
happened had you just
stayed away from her.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.028
Naomi came to me.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.595
She was gonna learn
the truth eventually.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.162
We had a deal.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.119
You broke it.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.818
Don't come back here.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.695
Bounty hunter is still here.

15:16.132 --> 15:19.527
He disappeared after our fight,
but now he's back.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.921
I can sense him.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.577
You are gonna
help me stop him.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.189
Why would I do that?

15:29.232 --> 15:32.583
Because he knows about
the both of us,

15:35.021 --> 15:36.718
and he will not keep
that to himself.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.072
Belinda's cabin
should be up ahead.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.031
This is like a real life <i>
Blair Witch</i>

15:45.074 --> 15:48.991
or <i>The Witch</i> or no,
wait, <i>Friday the 13th.</i>

15:49.035 --> 15:51.863
I don't know if I'm excited
or terrified.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.996
Doesn't everyone die
in those movies?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.389
No comment.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.086
Sorry we haven't gotten
a chance to talk.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.349
Really?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.264
Because it feels like you might
be avoiding me.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.919
I'm not.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.355
I'm just helping out a friend.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.097
There it is.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.056
FYI,
this is the part of the movie

16:10.099 --> 16:12.580
where people start yelling
at the characters to turn back.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.538
Do you guys smell that?

16:14.582 --> 16:16.758
- Smells like...
- Cookies?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.978
What is this place?

16:19.021 --> 16:21.981
Someone must have taken over
the cabin after Belinda left.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.157
I was not expecting this.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.116
Somehow it's even creepier.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.423
A camcorder.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.252
The battery's dead.

16:34.776 --> 16:35.820
Guys, check this out.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.044
That's what I saw in the woods.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.442
We need to go.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.793
Someone's coming, hurry!

16:56.406 --> 16:57.625
Director Richard.

17:00.628 --> 17:01.890
These are delicious.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.248
<i>♪ We gonna have</i> <i>
A little bit of fun ♪</i>

17:12.292 --> 17:14.990
I can't believe
Director Richard put
us on chore duty

17:15.034 --> 17:16.296
even after I called him
a cookie wizard.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.691
Who knew he'd be so
into stress baking?

17:20.735 --> 17:23.042
Ew, how does peanut butter
get under the table?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.608
Teenagers are animals.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.222
Hey, want to give us
a hand, townie?

17:29.265 --> 17:31.702
Since you're the reason
we're here in the first place.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.052
No one twisted your arm.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.707
Guys, chill.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.844
Let's just finish this and then
we can get back to Belinda.

17:42.887 --> 17:43.932
Back to Belinda?

17:44.715 --> 17:46.152
We're in trouble.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.588
I thought we were done
with the ghost hunt.

17:52.810 --> 17:56.553
You know, I think I saw
an old charger
in the science cabin,

17:56.597 --> 17:58.120
it might be for that camcorder.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.428
I remember because I was
like, "Whoa, vintage."

18:01.471 --> 18:03.343
- I think I'm gonna go get it.
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.316
How did they even find
Naomi's rock?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.536
You said you went there alone.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.973
They must have done a sweep
of the area after I left.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.498
You know what this means?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.457
We can't jump to conclusions.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.546
If Steel suspected us,
he wouldn't have
called you in to help.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.938
Unless it's a test.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.203
So you lie about
the translations.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.466
They still have the rock.
They'll analyze it.

18:39.509 --> 18:44.123
It won't take them long
to realize it's not
a material found on Earth.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.733
We don't have
many options here.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.475
We could leave.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.784
We've done it before.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.699
That was different.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.528
Naomi's in more danger
than ever, you know that.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.923
If we leave now,
it'll look like
we have something to hide.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.882
We do have something to hide.
Our daughter.

19:04.926 --> 19:08.016
I have to leave the service.
I won't be able to protect her.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.670
Is that really
what's best for us?

19:18.853 --> 19:20.028
I know you're scared.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.987
We have to do something.

19:24.815 --> 19:25.729
I know.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.037
We'll protect her.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.301
No matter what it takes.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.744
Oh! Hello.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.530
I wasn't expecting
any visitors.

19:43.573 --> 19:47.534
Science usually loses out
to the rock wall and zip line.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.753
Actually, we're here
on trash duty.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.103
Oh, okay.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.584
Uh, but we were wondering...

19:54.628 --> 19:57.283
Do... Do bears
actually like honey

19:57.326 --> 20:00.111
or is that more like
a rabbit-and-carrots-type lie?

20:00.155 --> 20:02.462
Oh, they actually do.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.595
Both brown and black bears
will raid beehives.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.163
- That's pretty dope.
- Right?

20:08.207 --> 20:12.036
Do you happen to have
any, uh, bear fossils
that we could check out?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.213
Of course! I'll be right back.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.261
It's right there.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.270
So, not to pry...

20:29.358 --> 20:31.447
Okay, I'm gonna pry.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.449
You were pretty quick
to volunteer for trash duty.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.757
Yeah, well, this weekend
isn't exactly going
the way I planned.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.108
You didn't have ghost hunt
on your Camp Shadow Ridge
bingo card?

20:43.329 --> 20:44.765
This is because of Anthony.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.289
Actually, it's not.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.899
So it's about Naomi.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.641
- Something to do with our many activities?
- No...

20:51.685 --> 20:54.340
Well, kind of.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.950
I thought things
were going well between you.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.386
They are. It's just...

20:57.430 --> 20:58.779
Naomi is always doing
a bunch of things.

20:59.736 --> 21:00.868
That's cool.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.043
I love that about her.

21:04.698 --> 21:07.396
I just want her to talk to me
about some of those things.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.660
You know, for real. Like...

21:10.704 --> 21:12.575
why she broke up with me
the first time.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.188
Take it from someone
who knows her very well.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.321
Naomi doesn't do
things lightly.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.670
She chose you.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.019
She kissed you.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.283
That means something.

21:27.416 --> 21:31.333
Belinda was keeping tabs
on every single plant
in these woods.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.597
Well, she was a naturalist,
so that makes sense.

21:34.641 --> 21:37.034
This doesn't.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.820
- See, this is a schematic of Shadow Ridge.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:39.863 --> 21:43.389
This big circled area,
that's the main cabin.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.522
Apparently they excavated
the area below it
three years ago,

21:46.566 --> 21:50.483
and it looks like they built
some kind of a room
underneath it.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.486
But why would they do that?

21:53.529 --> 21:56.663
And what does it
have to do with plants
and that blue glowing?

21:59.056 --> 21:59.970
Um...

22:01.320 --> 22:02.712
I should tell you

22:02.756 --> 22:05.367
that Nathan and I,
we've been talking again,

22:05.411 --> 22:07.369
and I really don't want
to make this weird...

22:07.413 --> 22:08.501
I know you kissed him.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.678
Everybody knows.
It's high school.

22:14.507 --> 22:18.337
- I really didn't want this to be weird.
- It's not weird.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.643
I know you and Nathan
have been a thing for a minute.

22:20.687 --> 22:21.949
Um...

22:24.038 --> 22:25.213
But you should know,

22:28.085 --> 22:29.565
he's not the only thing
out there.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.095
Jaeger is here.

22:38.139 --> 22:41.360
He's not moved
which means he's probably hurt.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.449
So we let him bleed out.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.842
He will not leave
without coming
after Naomi again.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.498
We have to find out
who sent him.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.373
You're not doing
this for Naomi.

22:54.416 --> 22:58.072
A Thanagarian war criminal
would be of high value
to a bounty hunter.

23:00.291 --> 23:03.077
Your people
aren't exactly known
for showing mercy to deserters.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.254
That's not who I am anymore.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.043
What I don't understand is
why are you still here?

23:14.567 --> 23:17.483
You can leave Port Oswego
and hide somewhere else.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.875
There are thousands of planets.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.749
And you speak of being royalty.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.185
Isn't this planet beneath you?

23:33.542 --> 23:35.501
Bounty hunters,
they carry a device.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.286
A record of their targets.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.941
That's what we need from him.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.771
And then what?

23:50.211 --> 23:51.255
There are other ways.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.609
This planet's made you soft.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.746
Did you guys know panda bears
have an extra bone
just for eating?

24:03.790 --> 24:05.182
Camera's ready.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.799
This couldn't possibly get
any more <i>Blair Witch.</i>

24:12.842 --> 24:13.843
<i>October 3rd.</i>

24:13.887 --> 24:15.758
Spoke too soon.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.499
<i>I'm in Gulch Springs tonight.</i> <i>
Taking samples as usual.</i>

24:18.761 --> 24:21.808
<i>Came across the glowing again.</i>

24:21.851 --> 24:26.029
<i>Even more unusual,</i> <i>
the closer I get to the glow,</i>

24:26.073 --> 24:28.771
<i>the stranger I feel.</i> <i>
Like I'm disoriented.</i>

24:29.772 --> 24:30.773
<i>Somebody there?</i>

24:39.303 --> 24:41.828
<i>The glowing is some kind</i> <i>
of a substance.</i>

24:41.871 --> 24:43.960
<i>Probably a chemical.</i>

24:44.004 --> 24:47.181
<i>They're using it to mess</i> <i>
with the ecosystem</i> <i>
in the forest.</i>

24:51.185 --> 24:52.882
<i>- What are you doing here?</i> <i>
- </i>

25:01.804 --> 25:03.937
Take two steps to your left.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.547
Okay, now one big step forward.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.073
Camping, eggs, and the rain.
Yay.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.815
You're doing great,
Annabelle.

25:12.859 --> 25:13.773
We need a plan.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.384
To do what?

25:16.427 --> 25:17.733
Find out whatever is really
going on in the woods.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.996
Belinda was clearly
onto something.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.650
Plus she knew
the person in the video,

25:21.694 --> 25:23.783
which means it was probably
one of the counselors.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.524
Ooh, camp conspiracy!

25:27.743 --> 25:30.006
We don't know that for sure.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.139
Wait, Nathan, stop,
take one big step back.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.666
Did we just fail team building?

25:37.710 --> 25:39.538
We should go
to the main cabin tonight

25:39.581 --> 25:41.409
while everyone else is away.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.324
See if we can find
some kind of proof.

25:43.367 --> 25:47.197
Or we could just
act like normal teenagers
and call the police.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.635
Yeah.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.288
Naomi, you're with me, right?

25:52.289 --> 25:53.856
I don't know.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.902
This is serious stuff.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.599
If someone is really trying
to do something bad
at the camp,

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
it could be dangerous.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.863
That's never
stopped you before.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.344
We just watched a woman
get chased through the woods.

26:03.387 --> 26:06.434
It's not exactly the same thing
as trespassing.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.523
Once we get home,
we can call the police.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.921
I thought we were
in this together.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.054
I guess I was wrong.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.452
<i>I don't know</i> <i>
about this, Greg.</i>

26:24.495 --> 26:26.193
There are no cameras
in the secure lab,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.803
so once we're in,
we'll be fine.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.283
But we should hurry.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.553
Lieutenant Ramirez.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.468
Major McDuffie.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.948
Pardon me, but what are
you doing here?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.169
I'm Dr. McDuffie.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.823
I'm the linguist on base.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.695
Commander Steel asked me
to work on the translation.

26:49.738 --> 26:52.872
Is there something I can
help you with, ma'am?

26:52.915 --> 26:57.180
I was hoping to ask you
some questions about
the properties of the artifact

26:57.224 --> 26:58.747
to guide my work.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.532
Um, material analysis
is still pending, so...

27:01.576 --> 27:04.666
Any help you could provide
would be really
valuable, Lieutenant.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.320
Of course. Uh, yeah.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.930
Let me show you what
I've been working on, doctor.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.106
So I'm having
a hard time...

27:10.150 --> 27:13.196
determining the nature of...
of the rock.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.721
I have never seen
anything like it before.

27:15.764 --> 27:19.072
- Um...
- Any theories about the age of the artifact?

27:19.115 --> 27:22.118
I would love to get even
a general idea of time period.

27:22.162 --> 27:26.688
Thermoluminescence test results
won't be available...

27:28.081 --> 27:30.387
until tomorrow.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.868
What about the composition?

27:32.912 --> 27:34.653
Oh, I'm not prepared
to speculate.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.570
I'm sorry.

27:39.614 --> 27:40.789
What does that have
to do with your work?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.704
This has been very helpful.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.010
We'll get out of your way.

27:44.053 --> 27:44.967
Thank you for your time.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.405
Major.

27:56.109 --> 27:59.416
I really miss my bed.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.244
The only thing nature
is reconnecting me to

28:01.288 --> 28:03.682
is my love of memory foam.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.206
At least we're not getting
chased through
the woods like Belinda.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.774
We made the right decision
to stay out of it, right?

28:08.817 --> 28:10.297
Oh, absolutely.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.386
It was a really bad idea.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.822
Do you want me
to keep agreeing with you?

28:15.781 --> 28:18.087
You think I should be
looking into the cover up?

28:18.131 --> 28:21.743
I think you think you should be
looking into the cover up.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.354
Are you trying to inception me?

28:24.398 --> 28:26.748
You agreed that it'd be
too dangerous.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.795
For me. For Anthony.
For Nathan.

28:31.318 --> 28:33.102
Maybe not for someone
with powers.

28:37.759 --> 28:41.981
My powers didn't do
very much good last time
against the bounty hunter.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.903
What if Dee hadn't shown up
when he did?

28:50.946 --> 28:53.122
That's like asking
what if the sky wasn't blue

28:53.166 --> 28:55.864
or what if Harry Styles
didn't rule the world?

28:55.908 --> 28:57.648
It's just not in the realm
of possibility.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.741
Fear is a new look on you.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.397
That fight just really
messed me up.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.791
I know.

29:09.835 --> 29:13.577
But I'm not just talking about
the bounty hunter.

29:13.621 --> 29:16.711
I'm talking about
a certain soccer player.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.147
He says you won't
be real with him.

29:18.191 --> 29:19.888
Wait, you're my best friend.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.542
You're obligated to take my side.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.330
It's not like I can be real
with him about who I am.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.726
Maybe not.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.728
But you can be real
with him about other things.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.472
The only thing to fear
is fear itself.

29:40.604 --> 29:41.910
And also snakes.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.362
You...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.681
I'm here with a one-time offer.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.205
I let you stay on this planet
until you heal.

30:17.598 --> 30:21.123
You give me your list.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.169
You Thanagarians
are all the same.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.562
So arrogant.

30:25.606 --> 30:28.130
You travel around the universe,

30:28.174 --> 30:29.653
ravaging other planets,

30:30.654 --> 30:32.743
under the guise of what?

30:32.787 --> 30:33.832
Peacekeeping?

30:34.745 --> 30:36.051
All you bring is war.

30:37.183 --> 30:38.749
I suggest you take the deal.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.536
I won't leave without my mark.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.843
Last time did not
end well for you.

30:45.669 --> 30:46.583
It's bad luck.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.282
This time it'll go better.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.066
I doubt that.

30:53.590 --> 30:54.853
You brought a friend.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.551
Who sent you here?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.423
I don't kiss and tell.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.349
That wasn't so hard, was it?

31:29.844 --> 31:32.281
<i>There are two ways</i> <i>
to deal with fear.</i>

31:32.325 --> 31:34.849
<i>You fight it or you face it.</i>

31:57.176 --> 32:00.266
Face the fear.
Face the fear.

32:00.309 --> 32:05.184
Identify, acknowledge,
release.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.182
Naomi, what are you doing here?

32:47.226 --> 32:48.401
What are you doing here?

32:48.444 --> 32:49.750
I'm looking for proof.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.099
So was I.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.883
You need to go. It's dangerous.

32:53.884 --> 32:54.798
You're here.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.498
Come on.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.947
What do you think
they're hiding?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.907
Maybe an experiment
or a chemical.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.605
That would explain
your reaction.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.503
I think I found something.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.532
What the hell is dilustel?

34:17.490 --> 34:18.665
I don't know.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.332
That's the same writing
as the disk.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.130
Naomi, I don't feel so good.

34:51.741 --> 34:52.655
Anthony?

34:54.222 --> 34:56.485
It must be the dilustel.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.530
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.151
It's locked.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.327
I had a feeling
someone would come.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.894
You should have been
more careful.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.722
Counselor Jeff?

35:15.765 --> 35:17.985
I wish you would've left this
alone, Naomi.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.206
Moonshine Jimmy was working
just fine as a cover.

35:21.249 --> 35:24.557
It scared people away
until you ruined it.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.736
Who are you?

35:29.779 --> 35:32.565
This element works
quickly on humans.

35:32.608 --> 35:36.569
Not so much on people like me
or people like you it seems.

35:45.099 --> 35:46.405
Come on.

35:57.416 --> 36:01.028
I think Director Richard
is going to be doing a lot
of stress baking.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.465
How are you feeling?

36:05.119 --> 36:06.033
Better.

36:10.298 --> 36:11.952
What do you think
Counselor Jeff
was doing with that?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.085
I don't know.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.350
You were pretty out of it.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.699
Do you remember anything?

36:21.091 --> 36:22.745
Not much.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.747
I remember being
down in the basement

36:24.791 --> 36:28.142
and finding
that blue rock thing.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.145
And then we were upstairs.

36:33.408 --> 36:34.453
It got really loud.

36:39.458 --> 36:42.504
And then the next thing
I remember is waking up
outside the cabin.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.641
I like to approach
linguistics challenges

36:48.684 --> 36:50.686
by comparing them
to existing languages.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.081
The markings on the rock,

36:54.124 --> 36:56.431
are statistically similar
to written languages,

36:56.475 --> 36:59.260
created by the ancient
peoples of Mesoamerica.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.612
What does it mean?

37:03.656 --> 37:06.441
The language on the artifact
is ancient.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.703
But it's not alien.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.273
The material analysis
also supports that conclusion.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.410
I had really hoped
that this would be
our breakthrough.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.369
There will be others, Major.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.591
Thank you for
your work, doctor.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.307
I understand
why some people like camp,

37:46.351 --> 37:47.874
but I am not one
of those people.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.182
You okay, babe?

37:52.879 --> 37:53.793
Yeah.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.534
I'm fine.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.020
Goodbye, Camp Shadow Ridge.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.283
May we never see you again.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.663
I thought we were
not going to make
a habit of this.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.492
Is the bounty hunter gone?

38:45.105 --> 38:47.325
I turned him over
to Adam Blake.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.197
He will take him
to the Phantom Zone.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.461
Did you find out who sent him?

38:55.245 --> 38:56.159
Yes.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.602
Do we need to be concerned?

39:05.995 --> 39:06.909
You don't.

39:07.780 --> 39:08.694
At least for now.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.320
There is another name
on the list

39:26.364 --> 39:28.061
that will be
of interest to you.

39:30.759 --> 39:31.978
Qyeala.

40:04.576 --> 40:05.577
Hi.

40:06.795 --> 40:07.883
Where's the screen?

40:08.928 --> 40:09.972
No movie this time.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.540
Just talking.

40:12.584 --> 40:16.152
<i>♪ My love for you</i> <i>
Well, it's kind of insane♪</i>

40:16.196 --> 40:18.938
I broke up with you before
because I was afraid.

40:18.981 --> 40:22.115
<i>♪ I couldn't complain</i> <i>
About it... ♪</i>

40:22.158 --> 40:23.421
Afraid of getting hurt.

40:25.771 --> 40:26.685
It was too real.

40:28.904 --> 40:29.905
Then why did you kiss me?

40:32.299 --> 40:34.344
Because I thought we could
just have all the fun parts.

40:35.998 --> 40:36.912
But you were right.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.219
We can't do that part forever.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.049
So I wanted to tell you,

40:44.398 --> 40:46.052
I'm still afraid.

40:46.095 --> 40:49.534
<i>♪ But I'm sick</i> <i>
Of talk, talk, talking... ♪</i>

40:49.577 --> 40:52.450
But I'm more afraid
of not trying.

40:55.844 --> 40:58.151
<i>♪ You should be</i> <i>
Walk, walk, walking ♪</i>

40:58.194 --> 41:01.459
<i>♪ Walk, walk, walking with me♪</i>

41:01.502 --> 41:02.503
So we're doing this?

41:03.896 --> 41:04.940
The real version?

41:05.767 --> 41:06.942
The real version.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.379
Plus the kissing.

41:09.423 --> 41:10.598
If you're still, I don't know,
into that part.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.995
<i>♪ You should be</i> <i>
Walk, walk, walking ♪</i>

41:16.038 --> 41:18.432
<i>♪ Walk, walk, walking with me♪</i>
