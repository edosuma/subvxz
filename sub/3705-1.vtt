Sweetie, it <i>'</i> s okay
if you want to
sign up for the race,

04:51.037 --> 04:52.265

05:38.618 --> 05:41.314
Do you ever wish that
Sophie had stayed here
at the bakery

05:41.388 --> 05:42.616
instead of
moving to Paris?

05:43.023 --> 05:45.548
No, She <i>'</i> s got her

05:53.033 --> 05:56.059
Yes, it is,
I wish I couId heIp her,

05:56.703 --> 05:58.671
Owning a bakery is tough,

You don <i>'</i> t want to heIp,

01:10:33.242 --> 01:10:34.436
You want to take over,

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:35.772
No, no, no,
Of course not,

01:10:35.845 --> 01:10:37.540
It <i>'</i> s just,
when I was in Paris

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:39.046
I got to work with
peopIe who knew

01:10:39.115 --> 01:10:40.844
what they were doing
running a reaI business,,,

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:43.886
But the Paw Spa
is a reaI business,

01:10:45.087 --> 01:10:46.384
I know that, I just,

01:10:46.455 --> 01:10:48.446
thought we couId
use everything that
I Iearned in France

01:10:48.524 --> 01:10:50.321
to make the Paw Spa
better back here
in the States,

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.351
You thought
our dog business
wouId be an epic faiI,

01:10:53.429 --> 01:10:54.691
And it wasn <i>'</i> t,

01:10:54.997 --> 01:10:56.555
I <i>'</i> ve got news
for you, Grace,

01:10:56.632 --> 01:10:58.099
We have
good ideas, too,

01:10:58.167 --> 01:10:59.600
It <i>'</i> s not aII about you,

01:11:00.636 --> 01:11:02.695
Come on, EIIa, Let <i>'</i> s go,

01:11:04.073 --> 01:11:05.199
MADDY: HonestIy,

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.144
And you <i>'</i> re sure
there <i>'</i> s nothing
your parents can do?

01:11:14.216 --> 01:11:17.208
They <i>'</i> re so far behind
on the mortgage payments,
I don <i>'</i> t see how,

01:11:17.286 --> 01:11:19.254
It <i>'</i> s so sad to think
of cIosing down

01:11:19.322 --> 01:11:21.722
your mom and dad <i>'</i> s bakery
after aII these years,

01:11:23.326 --> 01:11:25.521
Grandma and Grandpa <i>'</i> s
bakery is cIosing?

01:11:26.095 --> 01:11:29.121
Oh, honey,
you weren <i>'</i> t supposed
to hear any of that,

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:24.850
You can <i>'</i> t give up
on our bakery,

01:12:25.821 --> 01:12:30.690
Honey, beIieve me,
we don <i>'</i> t want to,
but we owe so much money,

01:12:31.093 --> 01:12:32.924
But, I can heIp,

01:12:33.429 --> 01:12:35.659
I want to try and get
more customers,

01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:38.165
and I <i>'</i> ve been
saving my aIIowance,

01:12:39.268 --> 01:12:41.759
pIus the money
from the cupcake saIe
to buy new bikes,

01:12:42.805 --> 01:12:44.170
But here,,,

01:12:50.346 --> 01:12:52.211
I want you to
use it for the bakery,

01:12:54.784 --> 01:12:56.342
Grace, pIease sit down,

01:12:59.689 --> 01:13:01.850
It is incredibIy
generous of you,

01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:05.087
but we are taIking about
a huge amount of money,

01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:07.652
And business has been
decIining for a whiIe,

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:09.095
It might not be worth,,,

01:13:09.165 --> 01:13:10.427
Not worth it?

01:13:11.934 --> 01:13:13.993
Of course our bakery
is worth it,

01:13:14.637 --> 01:13:16.434
It <i>'</i> s more than
just a business,

01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:19.073
When I was with
UncIe Bernard in Paris,

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:23.173
I saw that his business
was more than just
where he worked,

01:13:23.779 --> 01:13:25.747
It was Iike part of him,

01:13:26.449 --> 01:13:27.882
Aunt Sophie, too,

01:13:28.584 --> 01:13:31.678
They put aII of their
Iove and hard work
into that pIace,

01:13:32.521 --> 01:13:34.011
Just Iike you have here,

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:39.557
This bakery was your dream,
and now it <i>'</i> s part
of our famiIy,

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.995
We can <i>'</i> t Iet it go,

01:13:45.468 --> 01:13:47.800
Can <i>'</i> t we at Ieast
try to save it?

01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:55.006
Of course we can,

01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:58.143
But we don <i>'</i> t want you
to get your hopes up,

01:13:58.481 --> 01:13:59.573
Too Iate,

01:13:59.648 --> 01:14:02.515
We can save the bakery,
I just know it,

01:14:05.287 --> 01:14:06.652
Oh, I know,

01:14:15.364 --> 01:14:16.490
Thanks for coming,

01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:20.832
Um, I just wanted
to say that

01:14:24.774 --> 01:14:27.937
I <i>'</i> m reaIIy sorry
for everything I
said yesterday,

01:14:29.478 --> 01:14:31.070
We <i>'</i> re sorry, too,
I <i>'</i> m so sorry,

01:14:31.147 --> 01:14:33.377
We were supposed to
be your besties,

01:14:33.449 --> 01:14:35.849
but we were
acting Iike worsties,

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:38.443
I can <i>'</i> t beIieve I said
aII those mean things,

01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:41.046
You were right,
I wasn <i>'</i> t Iistening,

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.922
I mean, you guys
have great ideas too,

01:14:43.993 --> 01:14:48.794
And the truth is,
I reaIIy missed
you guys in Paris,

01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:51.023
It was miserabIe at first,

01:14:51.801 --> 01:14:54.565
I just made it
sound perfect because
I was jeaIous that you guys

01:14:54.637 --> 01:14:58.630
started this amazing business
and were having so
much fun without me,

01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:00.004
(BOTH GIGGLE)

01:15:00.075 --> 01:15:02.737
WeII, actuaIIy,,,

01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:06.908
The Paw Spa isn <i>'</i> t going
quite as great
as we made it sound,

01:15:06.982 --> 01:15:09.917
We don <i>'</i> t have a ton of
customers Iike we said,

01:15:09.985 --> 01:15:11.782
More Iike,,,
One,

01:15:12.454 --> 01:15:14.046
Yeah,
Goose is my aunt <i>'</i> s dog,

01:15:15.024 --> 01:15:18.721
We exaggerated
because we were jeaIous
of your perfect summer,

01:15:18.794 --> 01:15:20.455
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:15:20.529 --> 01:15:21.928
Um, um,,,

01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:24.932
But there <i>'</i> s something eIse,
I need your heIp,

01:15:25.668 --> 01:15:27.636
My grandparents <i>'</i> bakery

01:15:27.703 --> 01:15:29.466
but I have a pIan
to save it,

01:15:29.538 --> 01:15:30.562
No,

01:15:30.639 --> 01:15:32.436
You? A pIan?

01:15:32.508 --> 01:15:33.907
I <i>'</i> m shocked,

01:15:34.243 --> 01:15:35.870
But this pIan is speciaI,

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:40.181
When I was in Paris,
my uncIe made sure
everyone had the right job,

01:15:40.683 --> 01:15:44.414
And when aII of
the jobs were put together,
the kitchen was Iike magic,

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.583
We couId have
the same thing here,

01:15:47.523 --> 01:15:52.222
This time,
I promise it wiII reaIIy
be aII of us together,

01:15:53.829 --> 01:15:54.955

Hi,

UncIe Bernard

With this order,
we have doubIed our

ReaIIy? So does this mean
we saved the bakery?

01:17:55.484 --> 01:17:57.281
As Iong as they

01:17:57.353 --> 01:18:00.845
