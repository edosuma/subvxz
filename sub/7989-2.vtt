00:01.181 --> 00:03.244
Previously on Shades of Blue...

00:04.714 --> 00:06.314
Loman!

00:06.316 --> 00:08.750
A video game?

00:08.752 --> 00:09.918
I heard shots. They sounded real.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.919
You heard them too, right?

00:10.921 --> 00:11.986
I'll protect you.

00:11.988 --> 00:13.154
It wasn't a clean shoot.

00:13.156 --> 00:14.589
You don't say.

00:14.591 --> 00:15.990
There's a new bookie.

00:15.992 --> 00:18.459
You collect, and then you
give him the rundown.

00:18.461 --> 00:20.028
- Get on the ground.
- Lower the weapon,

00:20.030 --> 00:21.429
- Detective Santos.
- Police.

00:21.431 --> 00:23.198
It's you who's under arrest.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.733
Provided your cooperation
leads to convictions,

00:25.735 --> 00:27.302
We'll grant you full immunity.

00:27.304 --> 00:28.736
Look, if you planned this whole thing...

00:28.738 --> 00:30.405
Thinking I was gonna rat out my crew...

00:30.407 --> 00:31.806
You have a daughter, don't you?

00:34.377 --> 00:36.377
Look, the crew's gonna
be hitting the street.

00:36.379 --> 00:38.613
I can't. Cristina's car got hit.

00:38.615 --> 00:42.584
Her friend borrowed it and
smashed in the front end.

00:42.586 --> 00:44.385
You never said anything
about wearing a wire.

00:44.387 --> 00:46.387
There's a camera in the stone.

00:51.261 --> 00:52.727
What's the matter?

00:52.729 --> 00:54.929
Every betrayal begins with trust.

00:59.903 --> 01:02.570
There's a rat.

01:02.572 --> 01:04.638
There's a rat!

01:04.641 --> 01:07.976
An FBI informant on my team.

01:09.746 --> 01:11.012
I need to kill it.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.817
And I need to kill it.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.494 --> 01:27.495
And you're gonna help me,

01:27.497 --> 01:29.998
Because you're the only one I trust.

01:44.114 --> 01:46.214
How do you know this?

01:49.686 --> 01:52.553
Just tell me everything
that you've heard.

01:54.357 --> 01:58.126
How many years...

01:58.128 --> 02:01.796
Have we been working together?

02:01.798 --> 02:03.231
Since Cristina was six.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.800
That's ten years.

02:05.802 --> 02:08.703
Is that how long it takes before
you really know someone...

02:08.705 --> 02:10.872
Is ten years?

02:10.874 --> 02:13.041
Eight?

02:13.043 --> 02:16.177
Espada's been with me for eight years.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.346
What about Tess?

02:18.348 --> 02:20.581
15 years.

02:20.583 --> 02:23.017
That's a long time.

02:23.019 --> 02:26.654
Stood up at weddings, at funerals.

02:26.656 --> 02:28.656
What about six?

02:28.658 --> 02:31.826
Tufo and Saperstein... almost six years.

02:31.828 --> 02:34.095
Six years apiece.

02:34.097 --> 02:36.397
That's six years of roll call,

02:36.399 --> 02:40.134
Of tough arrests, stakeouts...

02:43.006 --> 02:46.441
Six years of seeing crime
scenes that you're never,

02:46.443 --> 02:49.377
ever gonna unsee.

02:49.379 --> 02:53.181
If it's too hard to believe, it's...

02:53.183 --> 02:55.083
Probably not true.

02:55.085 --> 02:57.452
45 years.

02:59.189 --> 03:01.756
That's 45 years...

03:01.758 --> 03:04.058
of friendship,

03:04.060 --> 03:05.460
of loyalty.

03:05.462 --> 03:06.961
Boss...

03:08.598 --> 03:10.365
What is it really?

03:10.367 --> 03:12.066
What is it that has you suddenly

03:12.068 --> 03:15.703
so convinced that someone
would do this to us?

03:19.943 --> 03:22.377
Yo, Red Simons keeps calling.

03:22.379 --> 03:23.978
A black sedan with white fenders

03:23.980 --> 03:25.546
has slow-rolled past his liquor store

03:25.548 --> 03:26.948
three times in the last hour.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.583
All right. So have dispatch send a car.

03:28.585 --> 03:30.952
They did, but Red says
since he pays protection,

03:30.954 --> 03:32.653
he wants one of us to
go and hold his hand.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.655
- Now?
- 15 minutes, max.

03:34.657 --> 03:36.290
I mean, I'd go, but I already had a few.

03:36.292 --> 03:38.993
You know. What you want me to do?

03:41.131 --> 03:43.965
- I'll take you.
- Harlee, no.

03:48.838 --> 03:50.671
You and I will go.

04:00.817 --> 04:04.952
You notice any of the team
acting different, agitated?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.921
We're cops. Agitation
comes with the job.

04:06.923 --> 04:08.623
Ducking shifts, private calls...

04:08.625 --> 04:10.191
You know what I'm asking.

04:10.193 --> 04:12.827
I can't believe this is a real question.

04:12.829 --> 04:15.696
I have it on good authority, Harlee.

04:15.698 --> 04:20.334
And this authority definitely
puts an informant in our crew?

04:20.336 --> 04:21.736
Yes.

04:24.707 --> 04:26.207
The feds deal in fear.

04:26.209 --> 04:28.810
When people are scared,
they make mistakes.

04:28.812 --> 04:30.678
I hand-picked this crew.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.115
I know them. I can read them.

04:34.117 --> 04:35.349
We pay attention,

04:35.351 --> 04:37.151
and the decent part of this person,

04:37.153 --> 04:38.619
the part that, deep down,

04:38.621 --> 04:40.154
wants to be discovered...

04:40.156 --> 04:41.722
It's gonna reveal itself.

04:46.729 --> 04:49.230
Are you hearing this?

04:52.368 --> 04:56.737
Come on. A liquor salesman
needs some coddling.

04:56.739 --> 04:58.973
Can't two patrolmen coddle him?

04:58.975 --> 05:01.876
You know, 20 years ago, a car
goes rolling by twice...

05:01.878 --> 05:05.901
Didn't Tufo say black
import, white fenders?

05:07.684 --> 05:08.683
Get down!

05:15.892 --> 05:18.259
You all right?

05:18.261 --> 05:19.894
- You're hit.
- No. I'm fine.

05:19.896 --> 05:21.195
I'm fine. Call it in.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.798
It's heading West on 68th street.

05:25.068 --> 05:26.734
- Just one shooter?
- Yeah, the driver.

05:26.736 --> 05:28.269
Single-grip shotgun.

05:28.271 --> 05:29.737
Was he shooting at you or the store?

05:29.739 --> 05:31.205
Does it matter?

05:31.207 --> 05:33.174
Two officer-involved
shootings in three days?

05:33.176 --> 05:35.276
You might want to start
wearing Kevlar in the shower.

05:36.946 --> 05:38.746
- Too soon?
- Copy that.

05:38.748 --> 05:40.548
Guys, guess what?

05:40.550 --> 05:42.850
Two more liquor stores shot up
ten minutes before this one.

05:42.852 --> 05:44.051
One's a drive-by.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.053
Black import with replacement fenders.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.022
This sounds like our menace.

05:48.024 --> 05:49.524
Intentional or not,

05:49.526 --> 05:51.225
nobody's gonna take a
shot at me, my crew,

05:51.227 --> 05:53.060
or anybody else, all right?

05:53.062 --> 05:55.730
Nobody goes home until we put
this son of a bitch in cuffs.

05:55.732 --> 05:58.499
All right? I'll take the heat,
but we got to get this shooter.

06:00.603 --> 06:02.803
Oh, speaking of shooters...

06:02.805 --> 06:05.039
Harlee, you're gonna be with me, okay?

06:05.041 --> 06:06.407
We'll work command at the precinct.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.875
I heard our team numbers on the scanner.

06:07.877 --> 06:09.911
- Where do you want me?
- When we all leave,

06:09.913 --> 06:11.579
I want you to go over
to the doughnut shop.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.047
All right? Just stay there.

06:13.049 --> 06:14.315
What am I looking for?

06:14.317 --> 06:16.417
You'll know it when you see it, okay?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.119
Yes, sir.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.721
- I'll be back in a minute.
- You like doughnuts?

06:20.723 --> 06:22.623
- No, sir.
- You don't like doughnuts?

06:22.625 --> 06:24.625
What kind of cop is he gonna be?

06:32.068 --> 06:33.467
- Restroom?
- Employees only.

06:33.469 --> 06:34.936
Keep it that way.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.340
You messed up.

06:39.342 --> 06:40.942
Can you hear me?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.277
You have no idea what you're doing.

06:43.279 --> 06:46.414
He knows there's a mole.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.349
There's a leak on your end.

06:48.351 --> 06:50.051
You're gonna get me killed.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.528
Yo, I don't care, man.
Just keep walking.

07:03.530 --> 07:04.762
- Come on, man.
- So you're saying

07:04.764 --> 07:06.379
you were at your girlfriend...

07:06.763 --> 07:08.863
What are you doing? That's
just gonna hurt you.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.250
Listen, can Linda drive you to practice?

07:11.252 --> 07:13.051
Because you know I hate
you dragging that cello

07:13.053 --> 07:14.253
on the subway.

07:14.255 --> 07:15.587
Did you get any sleep?

07:15.589 --> 07:17.022
Not really. A little.

07:17.024 --> 07:18.390
How about you?

07:18.392 --> 07:19.958
I'm making breakfast.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.426
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

07:21.428 --> 07:22.794
- INCOMING CALL UNKNOWN
- Coward-ass police!

07:22.796 --> 07:24.930
- Who is that yelling?
- Nobody, baby.

07:24.932 --> 07:26.632
A concerned citizen.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.534
- We're making juices.
- I'm sorry, baby.

07:28.536 --> 07:30.068
I can't hear you.

07:30.070 --> 07:31.770
Never mind.

07:31.772 --> 07:33.805
I'll talk to you later. Be safe.

07:33.807 --> 07:35.607
Okay.

07:35.926 --> 07:37.259
You gonna answer that?

07:37.261 --> 07:38.427
Somebody needs help.

07:38.429 --> 07:40.729
Probably shot by a cop.

07:40.731 --> 07:42.130
Santos.

07:42.132 --> 07:44.066
One block North on Garfield. Black SUV.

07:44.068 --> 07:45.868
But we need to debrief now.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.703
Just tell them that you're
gonna get a cup of...

07:47.705 --> 07:49.738
coffee.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.985
Special Agent Stahl?

08:02.987 --> 08:04.219
SA Molly Chen.

08:04.221 --> 08:06.154
I've been assigned to your detail.

08:06.156 --> 08:07.923
They're all working,

08:07.925 --> 08:10.325
snatching collars, looking for
the liquor store shooter.

08:10.327 --> 08:11.727
Well, there's nothing
like sleep deprivation

08:11.729 --> 08:13.662
to make an informant crack.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.330
You rule anyone out yet?

08:15.332 --> 08:16.632
It can't be the rookie.

08:16.634 --> 08:18.667
He killed a guy on his second shift.

08:18.669 --> 08:20.602
The FBI would've pulled him.

08:20.604 --> 08:22.905
- That's five left.
- No, four.

08:22.907 --> 08:26.108
Tess, Espada, Tufo, Saperstein.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.676
And Harlee.

08:29.313 --> 08:31.346
Well, you're looking at everyone, right?

08:31.348 --> 08:33.515
No, Donny. I forgot how to work a case.

08:33.517 --> 08:35.317
I'm just saying you have
a blind spot for her.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.486
A detective starts with
the most probable.

08:37.488 --> 08:39.655
The FBI profiles potential informants

08:39.657 --> 08:41.256
long before they pick them up.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.957
They're looking for the most resourceful

08:42.960 --> 08:45.861
with the most to lose and
the biggest secrets.

08:45.863 --> 08:48.530
Who is that in your unit?

09:13.023 --> 09:14.823
Lieutenant Wozniak, James Nava,

09:14.825 --> 09:16.625
your new assistant district...
hang on a minute.

09:16.627 --> 09:18.961
- Tufo!
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

09:18.963 --> 09:20.796
Loman's at the doughnut shop.
He thinks the theater

09:20.798 --> 09:22.831
across the street might
have some security footage.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.299
Go help him extricate it.

09:24.301 --> 09:26.034
- Yeah, you got it.
- And don't sleep.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.069
Yes, sir.

09:27.071 --> 09:28.537
Got a few calls in to you.

09:28.539 --> 09:30.005
Look, I'm swamped, man.

09:30.007 --> 09:31.840
Me too. Public defender just

09:31.842 --> 09:33.809
published a tell-all about
his drug addiction.

09:33.811 --> 09:35.510
92 of his guilty clients

09:35.512 --> 09:38.814
immediately filed habeas corpus
petitions for new trials.

09:38.816 --> 09:40.182
All right, so what are you
hounding me about it for?

09:40.184 --> 09:42.017
You supervised four of the cases,

09:42.019 --> 09:44.219
going back as far as 12 years.

09:44.221 --> 09:46.855
Hey, so my frequent flier over
here just mentioned a kid

09:46.857 --> 09:49.191
named Stroke flossing a
dark Sedan, custom rims.

09:49.193 --> 09:51.226
Is Stroke the name on
his birth certificate?

09:51.228 --> 09:53.462
You should meet his
brother, heart attack.

09:56.033 --> 09:58.200
His real name is Clarence Morris.

09:58.202 --> 10:00.502
He has a registered Sedan that
matches our partial plate.

10:00.504 --> 10:02.938
There's no one at the address.

10:04.041 --> 10:07.075
- Put Tess and Espada on it.
- Okay.

10:08.679 --> 10:11.046
Heart attack... why would I say that?

10:11.048 --> 10:12.614
Well, she has that effect on everyone.

10:12.616 --> 10:13.915
Don't worry about it.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.684
I need archive files and your notes.

10:15.686 --> 10:18.887
Dibble, Foster, Girard, and Zepeda.

10:18.889 --> 10:20.622
Miguel Zepeda?

10:20.624 --> 10:23.191
Yeah, he has a decent chance
of getting out of prison.

10:23.193 --> 10:25.260
You remember him?

10:25.262 --> 10:27.429
He's one of the douche bags
I have a special place

10:27.431 --> 10:29.598
for in my heart.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.267
I'll swing by tomorrow.

10:32.269 --> 10:34.369
Evidence techs recovered 12-gauge slugs

10:34.371 --> 10:35.937
from all three liquor stores.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.640
A miracle there weren't
bodies to scrape up.

10:40.911 --> 10:43.545
Hey, what is it?

10:44.563 --> 10:46.548
It's just some old business.

10:58.060 --> 11:00.514
NEW YORK CITY POLICE - INFORMATION
IN THIS RECORD IS CONFIDENTIAL

11:11.108 --> 11:13.308
Are you afraid?

11:15.145 --> 11:17.913
Should I be?

11:17.915 --> 11:21.016
How well do you know Miguel Zepeda?

11:21.018 --> 11:22.984
More than I'd like to.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.087
Why do you ask?

11:25.089 --> 11:28.423
He claims that you
framed him for murder.

11:37.508 --> 11:40.944
Look, I haven't seen Miguel
since he went to prison.

11:40.946 --> 11:43.079
And when was that?

11:43.081 --> 11:45.782
Six years ago. Grand theft auto.

11:45.784 --> 11:46.950
You have a daughter, right?

11:46.952 --> 11:50.687
She's six years old, right?

11:50.689 --> 11:52.856
It's interesting math.

11:56.865 --> 11:59.495
THIS WAS NOT THE DEAL...
DON'T TEST ME.

12:00.699 --> 12:03.399
Were you the responding
officer last week

12:03.401 --> 12:05.368
on a homicide at prospect park?

12:06.972 --> 12:09.205
Yeah. A homeless girl got stabbed.

12:09.207 --> 12:10.907
Four times.

12:10.909 --> 12:15.445
But there was no murder
weapon found on the scene.

12:17.382 --> 12:19.516
Yeah. Looks like.

12:27.826 --> 12:29.425
Define epic sex.

12:29.427 --> 12:31.127
I don't know. Over an hour?

12:31.129 --> 12:32.395
Damn, Joe.

12:32.397 --> 12:33.630
Good for you. Oh, no, no, no.

12:33.632 --> 12:34.964
Joe slept through it.

12:34.966 --> 12:37.133
Son of a bitch's phone lit up at 2 A.M.

12:37.135 --> 12:40.069
"Amber Blue Dock Bar" wanted
to know if my husband

12:40.071 --> 12:43.573
wanted to have some late-night
fun, so I obliged on his behalf.

12:43.575 --> 12:45.341
No, you didn't.

12:45.343 --> 12:46.809
Eight ways from Sunday.

12:46.811 --> 12:48.344
Oh, that's messed up.

12:48.346 --> 12:49.979
I mean, it's hot, but it's messed up.

12:49.981 --> 12:51.614
- You've got to talk to him.
- Oh, and say what?

12:51.616 --> 12:52.916
Yo, Joe, I boned your girlfriend.

12:52.918 --> 12:54.083
Best sex I had in months.

12:54.085 --> 12:55.652
- High five.
- I'm serious.

12:55.654 --> 12:57.520
Serious enough to break his legs for me?

12:57.522 --> 12:58.922
Yeah, if he actually did something.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.690
- But you need confirmation.
- Confirmation?

13:00.692 --> 13:02.292
You want to read the sick
stuff this bitch said?

13:02.294 --> 13:04.027
Absolutely. But that's not the point.

13:04.029 --> 13:06.095
Sexting is one thing,
but actual, physical,

13:06.097 --> 13:07.530
fleshy contact... that's another thing.

13:07.532 --> 13:09.299
Oh, no, no, no. Still cheating.

13:09.301 --> 13:11.134
Well, technically, you're the
one that did the typing.

13:13.471 --> 13:15.138
- Police!
- NYPD!

13:15.140 --> 13:16.839
Police!

13:16.841 --> 13:18.942
Stroke! Stroke, you in here?

13:18.944 --> 13:20.143
Hands above your head, now!

13:20.145 --> 13:21.544
Police! Get off the girl!

13:21.546 --> 13:23.648
Off the girl! Hands up!

13:24.382 --> 13:28.384
Wozniak received $50,000
laundered through a casino.

13:28.386 --> 13:30.553
Have you linked that to a
specific illegal activity?

13:30.555 --> 13:32.322
Not yet.

13:32.324 --> 13:34.324
But his whole crew is dirty.

13:34.326 --> 13:36.125
At some point, Wozniak's
gonna have to share

13:36.127 --> 13:39.495
whatever his greater ambition
is with somebody he trusts.

13:40.532 --> 13:42.732
And I'm betting it's her.

13:44.135 --> 13:45.568
She looks angry.

13:45.570 --> 13:48.871
Yeah. Well, so am I.

13:48.873 --> 13:51.741
Are you completely incompetent
or just straight-up crazy?

13:51.743 --> 13:53.209
You are my asset.

13:53.211 --> 13:55.478
That means when I call you,
you pick up the phone.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.479
You blew it on your end.

13:56.481 --> 13:57.847
You have a leak. Now what?

13:57.849 --> 13:58.982
You want me to slap a sign on my back?

13:58.984 --> 14:01.751
There is no leak on my end.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.353
There's only a few people
in the Bureau that even

14:03.355 --> 14:04.687
know there's an investigation going on.

14:04.689 --> 14:05.922
Then stop calling me.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.924
You're not giving me a choice.

14:07.926 --> 14:09.592
You destroyed the surveillance necklace.

14:09.594 --> 14:12.095
- You haven't checked in.
- I wore it as long as I could.

14:12.097 --> 14:14.097
Yeah? And what have you told him since?

14:14.099 --> 14:16.532
- Who?
- You know who.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.201
Harlee, if you think
there's some play here

14:18.203 --> 14:20.503
where you tell Wozniak
that we've approached you

14:20.505 --> 14:22.238
and you beg for his forgiveness,
that's not going to happen.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.840
Trust me, if I knew you were
gonna blow it like this,

14:23.842 --> 14:26.409
- I would have.
- No one has outed you.

14:26.411 --> 14:28.011
If you're worried about the
strike team that arrested you,

14:28.013 --> 14:30.580
I cleared them. They're solid.

14:30.582 --> 14:32.415
Someone's talking.

14:34.519 --> 14:38.855
Wozniak's Intel is limited at best.

14:38.857 --> 14:40.923
Otherwise, he would have acted already.

14:40.925 --> 14:42.625
Let me find out what he knows,

14:42.627 --> 14:45.762
but we need to develop
some kind of protocol here

14:45.764 --> 14:47.630
while I requisition another wire.

14:47.632 --> 14:50.366
Requisition?

14:50.368 --> 14:53.369
What kind of operation
are you running here?

14:53.371 --> 14:56.039
My life is at risk because of you.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.641
My daughter's future is
at risk because of you.

14:58.643 --> 15:00.576
Now leave me alone.

15:00.578 --> 15:02.645
Give me a chance to survive
your incompetence.

15:02.647 --> 15:06.049
Agent Chen, draw your service weapon.

15:06.051 --> 15:07.383
Excuse me?

15:07.385 --> 15:09.118
Detective Santos feels
her life is at risk.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.722
We're shutting down.
We're making the arrest.

15:12.724 --> 15:13.790
Draw your weapon now,

15:13.792 --> 15:15.158
Agent Chen.

15:18.663 --> 15:20.396
You've got about 85 yards to decide

15:20.398 --> 15:23.066
how you're gonna spend
the next ten years.

15:23.068 --> 15:26.235
A bluff this size is
above your pay grade.

15:26.237 --> 15:28.304
75 yards.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.306
What do you want me to say?

15:30.308 --> 15:32.742
You're really gonna blow
your whole operation?

15:32.744 --> 15:34.877
Oh, look. Friends across the street.

15:38.450 --> 15:40.817
Okay. Fine, fine.

15:40.819 --> 15:42.151
You win.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.622
I win what?

15:47.992 --> 15:49.692
I'll follow your protocol.

15:49.694 --> 15:52.562
And do what you're
told when you're told.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.632
Whatever I'm told.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.083
Two days operational,

16:05.085 --> 16:06.718
and your informant is compromised?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.053
Nervous, not compromised.

16:08.055 --> 16:09.821
Wozniak doesn't know
anything definitive.

16:09.823 --> 16:12.657
Only that we accessed his inner circle.

16:12.659 --> 16:14.359
If I didn't think you had a strong lead

16:14.361 --> 16:16.027
in what could be a significant
public corruption case,

16:16.029 --> 16:19.197
I wouldn't have
authorized the operation.

16:19.199 --> 16:20.732
But if your informant is in danger...

16:20.734 --> 16:22.901
Detective Santos was
having second thoughts,

16:22.903 --> 16:24.669
and that's to be expected.

16:24.671 --> 16:26.171
We work through them.

16:26.173 --> 16:28.340
By ordering an agent
to pull a gun on her?

16:28.342 --> 16:30.241
I did what I had to do to
keep the operation alive.

16:30.243 --> 16:32.377
Just give me 24 hours to find the leak

16:32.379 --> 16:35.380
and get her in line.

16:35.382 --> 16:38.183
In another life, I was NYPD.

16:38.185 --> 16:40.385
I knew Harlee Santos as a rookie.

16:40.387 --> 16:41.886
If Wozniak didn't get his hooks in her,

16:41.888 --> 16:43.688
you could be working for her.

16:43.690 --> 16:47.025
Well, I'll try to remember that.

16:47.027 --> 16:49.060
24 hours.

16:51.431 --> 16:53.698
If only I had an informant
with your enthusiasm

16:53.700 --> 16:55.066
for backstabbing.

16:55.068 --> 16:56.635
She was at risk. I
followed the protocol.

16:56.637 --> 16:58.436
Four months putting this
operation together.

16:58.438 --> 16:59.938
You almost blow it up in four hours.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.606
Seems like it was already blown up.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.708
Look, at Quantico, protocols
may be hard lines.

17:03.710 --> 17:06.111
Out in the field, protocols are margins.

17:06.113 --> 17:09.280
We push them, because
the other side will.

17:09.281 --> 17:11.148
I understand. I've already
asked to be reassigned.

17:11.151 --> 17:12.884
Well, that's a really bad idea.

17:12.886 --> 17:14.152
Why?

17:14.154 --> 17:17.122
'Cause this case is gonna make you.

17:17.124 --> 17:19.223
I'm not talking till
somebody give me some pants.

17:19.226 --> 17:20.659
Listen, you want pants?

17:20.661 --> 17:22.327
Pants are what we call an
accommodation, all right?

17:22.329 --> 17:24.061
Gangsters that shoot at cops...
you guys don't get those.

17:24.064 --> 17:25.797
Do you want to help yourself?

17:25.799 --> 17:28.133
I want to get out of here
and into some pants.

17:28.135 --> 17:30.168
- That our guy?
- I didn't shoot at no one.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.736
Listen, the only reason
you're still breathing,

17:31.738 --> 17:33.138
Romeo, is because you didn't hit anyone.

17:33.140 --> 17:34.739
I was with my girl all night.

17:34.741 --> 17:35.774
I swear.

17:35.776 --> 17:37.575
Strap me to a lie detector.

17:37.577 --> 17:39.411
Hey, Tess, there goes an idea.

17:39.413 --> 17:41.913
Why don't we strap your husband
to a poly, and if he passes,

17:41.915 --> 17:43.248
then you let him keep his phone?

17:43.250 --> 17:44.315
I wouldn't put it past the bastard

17:44.317 --> 17:45.917
to stick a tack in his shoe.

17:45.919 --> 17:47.752
You know, I once had this wheelman

17:47.754 --> 17:50.288
that tried to beat the lie
detector by slathering Bengay

17:50.290 --> 17:52.424
all over his junk.

17:52.426 --> 17:56.327
That's an interesting strategy.

17:56.329 --> 17:59.531
Well, pain spikes the heart
rate on the control questions.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.500
It confuses the machine and
throws off the results.

18:02.502 --> 18:04.035
Did it work?

18:04.037 --> 18:05.970
I never hooked him up.

18:05.972 --> 18:09.974
He said that he would confess
if I let him wash it off.

18:09.976 --> 18:12.143
Creative police work.

18:12.145 --> 18:14.179
Yeah, I've been known to improvise.

18:15.882 --> 18:18.383
James Nava, your new ADA.

18:18.385 --> 18:20.552
Yeah. I caught that.

18:23.523 --> 18:26.624
Do you believe in coincidence?

18:26.626 --> 18:28.827
Depends on the coincidence, I guess.

18:28.829 --> 18:31.196
Well, for example, say...

18:31.198 --> 18:32.831
Two days ago,

18:32.833 --> 18:36.301
a police officer responds to a homicide.

18:36.303 --> 18:39.204
An anonymous call comes in
and places the murder weapon

18:39.206 --> 18:42.974
in the car of her ex-boyfriend.

18:42.976 --> 18:45.510
Did you lift a knife
from the crime scene?

18:45.512 --> 18:47.312
Absolutely not.

18:47.314 --> 18:49.380
Did you plant the knife
in Miguel Zepeda's car

18:49.382 --> 18:51.382
to keep him away from your daughter?

18:51.384 --> 18:52.684
No.

18:56.656 --> 18:59.390
Do you remember this
domestic disturbance call?

18:59.392 --> 19:01.259
- What's up?
- Our rookie came through.

19:01.261 --> 19:04.696
The boys upstairs pulled a still
frame from the theater camera.

19:04.698 --> 19:06.364
Loman's still there?

19:06.366 --> 19:08.533
Oh, yeah. Eyes still peeled
at the doughnut shop.

19:08.535 --> 19:09.901
Didn't even ask if he could go home.

19:11.204 --> 19:13.037
He knows we're messing with him.

19:13.039 --> 19:14.939
- It's a battle of will now.
- Yeah.

19:14.941 --> 19:18.543
Well, Loman's will just got us
a partial view of the shooter.

19:18.545 --> 19:20.745
There's a woman out there
looking to post bond for you,

19:20.747 --> 19:22.080
only she ain't your girl, Yessi,

19:22.082 --> 19:23.715
and she's too young to be your mama.

19:23.717 --> 19:25.250
So let her post it.

19:25.252 --> 19:27.886
I'm not stupid enough
to shoot at the police.

19:27.888 --> 19:29.888
Oh, but you're stupid enough to cheat.

19:29.890 --> 19:31.589
It's not like that.

19:31.591 --> 19:34.058
I'm loyal. Been with
the missus ten years.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.860
Oh, ain't she lucky?

19:35.862 --> 19:39.731
- I didn't shoot at no cop.
- Let me see your arm.

19:39.733 --> 19:42.433
Our shooter has a tattoo on his wrist.

19:42.435 --> 19:45.904
Well, I'll take my apology in cash...
small bills.

19:45.906 --> 19:47.972
I'll make this brief.

19:47.974 --> 19:50.742
This still frame tells me
that you're not our shooter,

19:50.744 --> 19:54.879
but what it doesn't tell me is
why the shooter was in your car.

19:54.881 --> 19:57.415
You clear that up, maybe you go home.

19:57.417 --> 20:00.118
I... I sold the car, all right?

20:00.120 --> 20:01.886
Off the books.

20:01.888 --> 20:04.556
Well, why don't you give
me an off-the-books name?

20:04.558 --> 20:05.957
Reggie.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.927
Hothead gunslinger, holes
up on 61st and 5th.

20:10.831 --> 20:12.597
- Cristina.
- Mom.

20:12.599 --> 20:14.232
Someone shot at a police officer?

20:14.234 --> 20:17.101
No one was hurt.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.770
What are you doing here?

20:18.772 --> 20:21.506
I thought you could use
a change of clothes.

20:21.508 --> 20:22.841
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:22.843 --> 20:24.409
I figured you had caffeine covered.

20:24.411 --> 20:25.910
Hey!

20:25.912 --> 20:27.745
Backup has arrived.

20:27.747 --> 20:29.013
Hey.

20:29.015 --> 20:30.849
Did motor pool fix your car already?

20:30.851 --> 20:33.685
No, they said it's gonna
be a few days still.

20:33.687 --> 20:35.453
You want me to lean on them?

20:35.455 --> 20:37.455
I can manage the subway for a week.

20:37.457 --> 20:38.957
You know what? Why don't
you meet me at my desk,

20:38.959 --> 20:40.458
and I'll grab my things, and we'll go.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.860
Yeah. Good lesson.

20:41.862 --> 20:44.362
Never loan your wheels to your friends.

20:44.364 --> 20:46.130
Oh, I don't loan it out.

20:46.132 --> 20:47.765
- I'm not allowed.
- Well, I would hope so.

20:47.767 --> 20:50.001
Not after they smashed it.

20:50.003 --> 20:51.002
Who?

20:51.004 --> 20:52.604
Your friends.

20:52.606 --> 20:53.872
No. Someone backed into it

20:53.874 --> 20:55.173
when it was parked on the street.

20:55.175 --> 20:56.474
You know what? The activity log is done,

20:56.476 --> 20:58.109
so I'm gonna take her home, okay?

20:58.111 --> 20:59.878
Oh, I can't.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.646
I was heading to Amy's to
work on a science project.

21:01.648 --> 21:03.481
Speaking of which, I need supplies.

21:03.483 --> 21:05.116
Okay. Supplies it is.

21:05.118 --> 21:06.985
I'll grab my bag and we'll
go to the hobby store.

21:06.987 --> 21:10.521
Mrs. Lowrey was gonna take us,
but some cash would be great.

21:10.523 --> 21:11.890
Here.

21:11.892 --> 21:13.858
Science is on me.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.526
That's a 50.

21:15.528 --> 21:17.028
It's all right. It's only money.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.563
Thanks, uncle Woz.

21:18.565 --> 21:20.365
So I should be home by 11:00,

21:20.367 --> 21:21.966
but I'll text you if we go late.

21:21.968 --> 21:24.569
- Okay.
- 10:30.

21:24.571 --> 21:25.937
- Bye.
- Bye, gorgeous.

21:29.042 --> 21:32.577
We need to take a drive.

21:32.579 --> 21:34.679
I thought we found our shooter.

21:34.681 --> 21:37.048
No, there's a new development.

21:47.928 --> 21:49.727
Looks like Reggie should've
used some of that car money

21:49.729 --> 21:51.663
on a decorator.

21:51.665 --> 21:53.598
Well, we all have our priorities.

21:58.939 --> 22:01.372
It's clear. Har?

22:01.374 --> 22:04.108
Do you think this guy did the
shooting to make a statement?

22:05.245 --> 22:06.678
Maybe he needs a hug.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.613
Maybe he couldn't help himself.

22:09.683 --> 22:11.883
Mood stabilizers... lithium.

22:11.885 --> 22:13.384
And the shotgun.

22:13.386 --> 22:15.053
The American way.

22:21.928 --> 22:24.162
Is she starting to lie to you?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.866
Cristina.

22:28.868 --> 22:32.704
I hope she doesn't
ever feel the need to.

22:32.706 --> 22:35.273
Wait a second. Am I going nuts?

22:35.275 --> 22:38.109
You told me that her
friend smashed the car.

22:41.214 --> 22:43.781
Look, I just let her story slide.

22:43.783 --> 22:45.583
I figured it was better
than interrogating her.

22:45.585 --> 22:48.453
You might learn things
you don't want to know.

22:48.455 --> 22:51.622
Kids never listen anyway.

22:51.624 --> 22:54.192
You got to model the important things.

22:57.497 --> 22:58.930
Yeah.

22:58.932 --> 23:01.466
Like how to get a sucker
to spot you a 50.

23:01.468 --> 23:04.002
Like not to rat on your friends.

23:07.107 --> 23:10.575
We should polygraph the crew. Yeah.

23:10.577 --> 23:12.310
We can act like it's
about a missing payment,

23:12.312 --> 23:13.945
then when they're hooked
up, straight-out ask them

23:13.947 --> 23:15.346
about the feds.

23:17.784 --> 23:20.251
Quickest way to know what's real.

23:20.253 --> 23:21.252
Get down!

23:23.790 --> 23:25.423
Police! Down!

23:36.310 --> 23:38.144
Nice shooting, Tex.

23:38.146 --> 23:40.646
Didn't the Marines teach you
to aim for the big circle?

23:40.647 --> 23:43.615
If he wasn't mentally ill,
he'd be meeting the coroner.

23:43.617 --> 23:46.084
As it is, he'll be seeing
the physical therapist.

23:50.524 --> 23:51.857
You okay?

23:51.859 --> 23:53.959
Go home and rest up.

23:53.961 --> 23:57.229
I'll round up the crew and tell
them to come over for dinner.

23:57.231 --> 23:59.030
I'm kind of exhausted, Woz.

23:59.032 --> 24:01.733
It's your polygraph idea.

24:02.970 --> 24:05.905
- My house at 8:30.
- Tonight?

24:05.906 --> 24:08.206
You'll be able to sleep otherwise?

24:20.254 --> 24:22.354
Oh, Joe's gonna be working late tonight.

24:22.356 --> 24:24.656
Doesn't need me to wait up. What a guy.

24:24.658 --> 24:26.858
At least that shouldn't
be too hard to verify.

24:28.262 --> 24:29.662
Well, I shouldn't have to.

24:29.664 --> 24:32.531
Why don't you just talk to Joe?

24:32.533 --> 24:34.867
If I have that conversation,

24:34.868 --> 24:36.334
I don't know where it ends.

24:36.336 --> 24:38.003
So you just grin and bear it.

24:38.005 --> 24:40.071
No. We make a detour.

24:40.073 --> 24:41.439
- For what?
- Housekeeping.

24:50.551 --> 24:53.118
- What are we doing here?
- Go take a leak, all right?

24:57.024 --> 24:58.456
Amber?

24:58.459 --> 25:02.028
Yeah. What are you drinking?

25:02.030 --> 25:04.863
PBR and a tequila shot.

25:04.865 --> 25:07.867
PBR, tequila shot.

25:07.868 --> 25:11.704
Little rude not to text on the
day after, don't you think?

25:11.705 --> 25:13.539
I'm sorry. Day after what?

25:13.540 --> 25:16.441
Oh, come on. Don't play coy.

25:16.443 --> 25:17.976
Do I know you?

25:17.979 --> 25:19.412
Seriously?

25:19.414 --> 25:21.379
We had sex last night.

25:21.381 --> 25:23.615
I mean, you thought it
was my husband, Joe,

25:23.617 --> 25:26.418
but trust me, honey, he would
never dine at the Y that long.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.656
Did I pull your hair too
hard when I was behind you?

25:33.827 --> 25:35.493
Look, bitch,

25:35.495 --> 25:37.095
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:37.097 --> 25:40.332
No? Let me jog your memory.

25:40.867 --> 25:42.916
Do you remember now?!

25:48.943 --> 25:51.042
Tess! Tess!

25:52.079 --> 25:53.678
- Stop!
- Two kids!

25:53.680 --> 25:56.182
- Two beautiful kids.
- Hey, hey!

25:56.184 --> 25:58.251
Police business, all right?
This never happened.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.284
It's better for both of us.

25:59.287 --> 26:00.352
Trust me.

26:00.354 --> 26:01.586
Let's go.

26:01.588 --> 26:02.854
What, you and your girlfriend broke up?

26:02.856 --> 26:04.089
Way to show some restraint.

26:04.091 --> 26:05.957
That was restraint.

26:22.676 --> 26:24.109
Hello, Harlee.

26:24.111 --> 26:26.345
I told you to stay out of my apartment.

26:26.347 --> 26:29.180
It's a very nice apartment,
especially for your pay grade.

26:29.182 --> 26:30.715
Did anyone see you come in here?

26:30.717 --> 26:33.019
My associate followed
Wozniak to his house.

26:33.021 --> 26:35.320
He's probably in his barcalounger,

26:35.322 --> 26:37.155
scratching his crotch.

26:37.157 --> 26:40.292
Well, she missed the polygraph
equipment that he snuck in.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.662
We're testing the whole crew.

26:43.897 --> 26:45.231
Tonight.

26:45.233 --> 26:46.665
You couldn't talk him out of that?

26:48.403 --> 26:51.136
I suggested it.

26:51.138 --> 26:52.204
Big move.

26:52.205 --> 26:53.638
I thought he was looking at me.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.473
I wanted to appear like
I was just as concerned

26:55.475 --> 26:57.309
as he was... on his side.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.345
Paranoia leads to over-thinking.

26:59.347 --> 27:01.546
Over-thinking can get you
in this kind of trouble.

27:01.548 --> 27:04.816
Wozniak confided in you
as soon as he knew,

27:04.818 --> 27:06.184
and you have to own that, Harlee.

27:06.186 --> 27:07.686
You have to own that trust.

27:07.688 --> 27:09.521
I didn't think he'd agree to it.

27:09.523 --> 27:11.057
I thought he'd want to be more careful.

27:11.059 --> 27:14.025
- Is he testing you?
- No.

27:14.028 --> 27:15.694
Just everyone else.

27:15.696 --> 27:17.195
And they'll pass.

27:17.197 --> 27:19.531
This actually could work in our favor...

27:19.533 --> 27:21.367
Give him reason to doubt his Intel,

27:21.368 --> 27:25.338
and you can nudge him
into another reality.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.340
Suddenly, there is no informant.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.242
Or someone has a bad day,

27:31.244 --> 27:33.845
gets nervous, indigestion...

27:33.847 --> 27:35.180
God knows.

27:39.519 --> 27:42.053
If he gets a false read...

27:42.055 --> 27:44.222
Just hope no one else in
your crooked little family

27:44.224 --> 27:46.825
is hiding any secrets.

27:56.204 --> 27:58.104
Hey, killer.

27:58.106 --> 28:00.805
I almost forgot about you.

28:00.807 --> 28:02.374
You here to relieve me?

28:02.376 --> 28:04.542
No, I think the one
place we know is secure

28:04.544 --> 28:06.579
is the doughnut shop, Loman.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.380
So what is this? Penance?

28:08.383 --> 28:09.948
Initiation. Stand down.

28:09.950 --> 28:11.716
We booked the shooter.

28:11.718 --> 28:12.885
Hey, doughnut boy?

28:12.886 --> 28:14.252
An apple fritter for my friend here.

28:14.254 --> 28:15.287
No. I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

28:15.289 --> 28:16.722
Hey, and an orange juice.

28:16.723 --> 28:18.656
He logged some genuine
detective work today,

28:18.658 --> 28:21.593
and all without shooting anybody.

28:21.595 --> 28:23.294
There's hope for you yet, bro.

28:23.296 --> 28:25.130
So what's the story?

28:25.133 --> 28:26.965
Liquor store shooter.

28:26.967 --> 28:29.467
I don't track the whys and
the what-fors, Loman.

28:29.470 --> 28:30.602
Oh, my bad.

28:30.604 --> 28:32.070
I thought you were a detective.

28:32.072 --> 28:33.271
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah.

28:33.273 --> 28:34.906
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:34.908 --> 28:36.742
Well, listen up. Intentions
aren't the point.

28:36.743 --> 28:38.943
The street is an us
versus them situation.

28:38.945 --> 28:41.113
It's best you understand that.

28:41.115 --> 28:43.481
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:43.483 --> 28:44.483
Where'd you grow up?

28:44.484 --> 28:46.785
Don't even, man.

28:46.787 --> 28:50.655
No, we... we are not
social workers, Loman.

28:50.657 --> 28:52.857
I mean, if I'm chasing some
thug through my old hood,

28:52.859 --> 28:54.459
the only color he sees is blue.

28:54.461 --> 28:55.693
Shouldn't we want to change that?

28:55.695 --> 28:57.329
- You want change?
- Yeah.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.097
Yeah? Yeah? Become a
kindergarten teacher, Loman.

28:59.099 --> 29:00.098
Funny.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.100
They give us a gun and a badge

29:02.102 --> 29:04.169
and dropkick us into calamity.

29:04.171 --> 29:06.504
By the time I pull my cuffs
out, the die is cast,

29:06.506 --> 29:08.106
and that's funny to you?

29:08.108 --> 29:09.307
Look, I'm just saying,

29:09.309 --> 29:10.309
we're meeting these
people at their worst.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.945
No, do not put your guilt on me.

29:13.947 --> 29:16.014
Or yourself, for that matter.

29:16.017 --> 29:19.885
You killed a man, and he was black.

29:19.886 --> 29:22.053
There it is.

29:22.055 --> 29:25.124
Yeah, he also was slinging dope
and had a gun pointed at you.

29:25.126 --> 29:28.193
We had to put the brother down.
That was his call, not yours.

29:28.195 --> 29:30.604
- You don't know what I did.
- I know you're still breathing, Loman.

29:31.531 --> 29:33.164
I know the politicians and the crybabies

29:33.166 --> 29:34.966
that want to stand around the sidelines

29:34.968 --> 29:39.304
and criticize how we do our job
never had to do our damn job.

29:39.307 --> 29:41.639
Or had the sack to try.

29:41.642 --> 29:44.175
Listen, man. You ain't...
you ain't hearing me.

29:44.177 --> 29:45.477
The public don't give a damn

29:45.479 --> 29:47.213
about your vulnerability in the street.

29:47.214 --> 29:49.682
That's not interesting.

29:49.684 --> 29:51.716
What it feels like to...
to bust through that door.

29:51.718 --> 29:54.385
You think they care?

29:54.387 --> 29:58.057
All that matters is that you get
home the same way you showed up.

29:59.926 --> 30:01.193
- Same way I showed up?
- Yes.

30:01.194 --> 30:02.360
The same way you showed up.

30:02.363 --> 30:04.896
The same way I showed up.

30:04.898 --> 30:07.899
Same way I showed up.

30:07.901 --> 30:10.135
I don't think that's possible.

30:28.388 --> 30:31.189
Hello?

30:39.566 --> 30:41.099
Woz?

30:42.537 --> 30:44.836
Have a seat. I'll be right there.

30:48.275 --> 30:51.609
What, do you have everybody
tied up in the basement?

30:51.611 --> 30:54.780
I changed my mind.

30:54.781 --> 30:58.517
Even with a decent cover story,
we'd still be tipping them.

31:00.287 --> 31:02.954
I'll just clear you tonight, Harlee.

31:04.457 --> 31:05.823
Linda has me on green tea.

31:05.825 --> 31:07.626
I made enough for two.

31:07.627 --> 31:09.561
I'll get it. No rush.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.763
I have to hit the bathroom.

31:11.765 --> 31:14.165
The sooner we start,
the sooner we're done.

31:16.136 --> 31:17.802
You can poly me if you want, Woz,

31:17.804 --> 31:20.171
but I'm not gonna do
it on a full bladder.

31:25.613 --> 31:27.312
Where is Linda, anyway?

31:27.314 --> 31:30.115
She's talking her sister
through this week's crisis.

31:30.117 --> 31:32.017
Can't let her know I have a polygraph.

31:32.019 --> 31:33.685
She'll want to use it on me.

31:33.687 --> 31:35.287
Nothing to hide, nothing to fear.

32:33.279 --> 32:36.014
No one else has gone in?

32:36.016 --> 32:38.050
Not since he's gotten home.

32:42.256 --> 32:44.256
Hello?

32:44.258 --> 32:45.757
Who's this?

32:45.759 --> 32:48.460
I said don't answer it.

32:48.462 --> 32:51.096
Put Cristina on the phone now.

32:51.098 --> 32:52.431
It's not funny.

32:58.305 --> 32:59.538
Pick up. Pick up.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.806
Pick up, Cristina.

33:08.382 --> 33:09.381
Mom, I'm fine.

33:09.383 --> 33:11.149
Where are you?

33:11.151 --> 33:13.585
We finished our work early and
went out to meet some friends.

33:13.587 --> 33:15.721
That's all.

33:15.723 --> 33:18.757
I'm not mad. Just tell me where you are.

33:18.759 --> 33:22.160
Bushwick, I think.

33:22.162 --> 33:24.262
Baby, you're not old
enough to be in some...

33:24.264 --> 33:26.198
Hello?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.667
Mom?

33:28.669 --> 33:30.602
Hold on. I can't hear you.

33:33.574 --> 33:35.307
When did you get to be 16?

33:35.309 --> 33:37.275
I'm gonna go find somewhere quieter.

33:37.277 --> 33:39.077
Baby, listen to me.

33:39.079 --> 33:41.513
Don't get in a car where
someone's been drinking.

33:41.515 --> 33:43.281
Mom... you hear me?

33:43.283 --> 33:44.816
Can you hear me?

33:44.818 --> 33:47.252
Make your own decisions.

33:47.254 --> 33:48.420
Think big.

33:48.422 --> 33:50.989
Don't... don't sell yourself short.

33:50.991 --> 33:52.324
You're the most talented
girl in any room.

33:52.326 --> 33:54.359
Mom are you there?

33:54.361 --> 33:56.461
Never settle.

33:56.463 --> 33:58.964
And never hold back.

33:58.966 --> 34:00.665
I can't hear you. I'm gonna hang up.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.067
Okay?

34:18.685 --> 34:20.851
And some day, have a daughter.

34:23.690 --> 34:26.525
She'll be the best part of your life.

34:26.527 --> 34:28.159
Mom, I'm headed home.

34:34.001 --> 34:36.701
Don't ever forget.

34:37.804 --> 34:40.172
Hey, Harlee, you okay?

34:40.174 --> 34:42.674
Yeah. I'll be... I'll be right out.

35:03.230 --> 35:05.831
Don't take it personally, Harlee.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.766
I need a good night's sleep.

35:07.768 --> 35:10.268
No, I get it. Basic police work.

35:10.270 --> 35:14.706
Start from the inside
and work your way out.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.541
Doesn't mean I won't give
you crap for it later.

35:18.045 --> 35:20.345
Well, I hope so.

35:20.347 --> 35:21.780
We should call this in.

35:21.782 --> 35:24.216
He could know it's her.

35:24.218 --> 35:26.551
Or maybe they're having dinner.

35:28.422 --> 35:31.256
You willing to bet her life on that?

35:31.258 --> 35:33.291
She's a good liar.

35:34.862 --> 35:37.295
What's your full name?

35:40.734 --> 35:42.567
Harlee Grace Santos.

35:44.972 --> 35:48.039
What's your badge number?

35:48.041 --> 35:49.574
You think I framed my ex-boyfriend

35:49.576 --> 35:51.409
for a fight we had seven years ago?

35:51.411 --> 35:53.778
- Just one?
- No.

35:53.780 --> 35:56.314
Miguel could run hot.

35:56.316 --> 35:58.049
Things could get loud.

35:58.051 --> 36:01.753
We had thin walls and nosy neighbors.

36:01.755 --> 36:04.322
He ever get physical with you?

36:04.324 --> 36:06.591
You see any charges?

36:13.066 --> 36:14.566
Here.

36:14.568 --> 36:16.201
Here.

36:16.203 --> 36:17.736
Here.

36:32.419 --> 36:35.086
Have you ever received
an unsanctioned gratuity

36:35.088 --> 36:38.623
while working as a police officer?

36:40.127 --> 36:43.028
Yes.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.730
Who pinned your detective badge on you?

36:48.702 --> 36:51.169
You did.

36:51.171 --> 36:54.372
I used to like when he got jealous.

36:54.374 --> 36:56.341
Can you believe that?

36:59.613 --> 37:02.714
But I knew I had to get
away from him, and...

37:03.884 --> 37:06.952
I was searching for a way out,

37:06.954 --> 37:09.087
when I found out I was pregnant.

37:15.062 --> 37:17.062
I almost lost the baby.

37:19.199 --> 37:21.266
I tried to get away.

37:23.971 --> 37:26.237
But he threatened to kill me.

37:28.141 --> 37:30.275
And I knew he would.

37:43.924 --> 37:46.257
And then a miracle.

37:46.259 --> 37:49.761
Miguel got sent down
for grand theft auto,

37:49.763 --> 37:51.763
and my whole life changed.

37:51.765 --> 37:55.333
You know, I wasn't scared anymore.

37:55.335 --> 37:58.737
But six years later, he got out.

37:58.739 --> 38:00.672
I was already a cop,

38:00.674 --> 38:03.375
so I knew I could handle him.

38:03.377 --> 38:05.610
But he didn't come after me.

38:07.681 --> 38:12.217
He started hanging around
Cristina's school.

38:12.219 --> 38:14.252
Watching.

38:14.254 --> 38:15.887
Taunting.

38:18.191 --> 38:20.425
Just...

38:20.427 --> 38:24.095
Like, letting me know that he
could control me at any time.

38:29.536 --> 38:32.771
You know what I see?

38:32.773 --> 38:36.274
I see a woman...

38:36.276 --> 38:39.110
Pushed past her limit.

38:39.112 --> 38:43.314
You did what you had to do

38:43.316 --> 38:45.316
to protect your daughter,

38:45.318 --> 38:48.753
to keep Miguel away from her.

38:48.755 --> 38:51.656
I would do anything to protect Cristina.

38:54.294 --> 39:01.833
Are you now or have you ever
been an informant for the FBI?

39:01.835 --> 39:03.701
No.

39:13.947 --> 39:17.248
I don't need you to confess.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.217
I already got you.

39:21.188 --> 39:23.321
You're the responding officer

39:23.323 --> 39:27.192
to the murder that you're
framing Miguel Zepeda for.

39:27.194 --> 39:30.328
Miguel Zepeda.

39:30.330 --> 39:33.331
The paper trail leads right back to you.

39:34.634 --> 39:37.602
This is a big mistake.

39:37.604 --> 39:40.772
You can explain the theory to my lawyer.

39:40.774 --> 39:44.109
Lawyer can't help you, Harlee.

39:44.111 --> 39:46.244
But you could help yourself.

39:48.882 --> 39:51.149
Erase the trail.

39:53.487 --> 39:57.055
How would I do that?

39:57.057 --> 39:59.757
Trust the right person.

40:01.561 --> 40:03.595
Something I should know?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.466
I never doubted you.

40:11.238 --> 40:14.072
Yeah, you did.

40:14.074 --> 40:17.675
You got to trust the right people?

40:17.677 --> 40:21.346
Right now, that's just you.

40:21.348 --> 40:23.014
You hungry?

40:23.016 --> 40:24.215
Famished.

40:24.217 --> 40:26.050
But I got to go.

40:26.052 --> 40:30.088
Cristina ran off to some
club without telling me.

40:30.090 --> 40:32.590
Why didn't you tell me?

40:32.592 --> 40:35.593
Would've seemed like an excuse.

40:35.595 --> 40:37.228
Now it's done.

40:41.001 --> 40:42.467
See you tomorrow.

41:28.748 --> 41:34.752
Are you now or have you ever
been an informant for the FBI?

41:34.754 --> 41:36.621
No.

41:42.929 --> 41:45.430
Did you plant the knife
in Miguel Zepeda's car

41:45.432 --> 41:47.999
to keep him away from your daughter?

41:48.001 --> 41:49.367
No.

41:51.671 --> 41:53.371
No.

41:55.108 --> 41:56.341
No.
