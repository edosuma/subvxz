10:18.966 --> 10:22.186
Background. You know, go deep.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.928
Even small things.
Stuff that would

10:24.972 --> 10:27.844
normally sneak by
a regular background check.

10:27.888 --> 10:28.932
Why?

10:28.976 --> 10:31.021
I need to see what he's about.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.414
[explosion outside]

10:32.457 --> 10:34.677
-God.
-I think we should do

10:34.721 --> 10:37.158
a safety course for the firm
and get some more security.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.377
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That makes sense.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.684
-Just keep me posted
with what we...
-[explosion]

10:41.728 --> 10:43.468
...need to do.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.601
Ah, he's pissed, that's why.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.559
Landau thinks I kept him from
a job in the Biden White House.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.736
-Did you?
-Yes, but so what?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.433
Good, we bring that up on cross.
Show he's biased.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.782
I mean, what could he say
about you anyway?

10:52.826 --> 10:54.479
I don't know
what he'll lie about,

10:54.523 --> 10:57.047
but we talked about wanting
those Trump outtakes.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.223
WESLEY:
You talked?
How much did you talk?

10:59.267 --> 11:00.921
Just theoretically
about a burglary,

11:00.964 --> 11:03.140
but not in a concrete
sort of way.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.533
You could still sell it
as someone

11:04.576 --> 11:06.187
taking our plan
and running with it.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.711
Sure. Maybe I took it and
burglarized the building myself.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.061
Marissa, do you need a moment?

11:11.105 --> 11:13.107
No, this is my moment.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.848
Here, with my loving dad,

11:14.891 --> 11:17.285
-supporting him.
-WESLEY: So, there was

11:17.328 --> 11:18.852
a plot?
Is that what we're saying?

11:18.895 --> 11:21.550
ELI:
It was standard rat-fucking.
You know,

11:21.593 --> 11:24.205
you talk about 100 possibilities
to mess with the other side.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.642
Y-You talk about sending hookers
to their prayer breakfast.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.211
They do the same to you, but you
don't break the law. [laughs]

11:30.254 --> 11:33.518
And if you do break the law, you
do it through intermediaries.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.606
Where are you going?

11:34.650 --> 11:36.565
To my desk, to do actual work.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.349
Your work is here.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.831
No. I-- You don't need me.
I am a laughingstock in court.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.051
-Get another lawyer to do that.
-ELI: Marissa.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.270
If you quit,

11:46.314 --> 11:48.359
-they will subpoena you.
-I know.

11:48.403 --> 11:49.970
I might have to testify.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.711
-WESLEY: Whoa, that is not...
-Wait, wait, wait.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.538
Wait. Hey.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.588
Okay, what do you want, Marissa?

11:59.631 --> 12:01.155
You want me to take you
on a father/daughter picnic?

12:01.198 --> 12:03.200
Is that it?
You want to go to Disneyland?

12:03.244 --> 12:04.985
Get photos taken
with mouse ears?

12:05.028 --> 12:08.292
This is who we are. If you're
in trouble, I help you.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.207
If I'm in trouble, you help me.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.688
-We're transactional.
-Exactly.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.690
-Always have been, always will.
-Okay.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.519
Here's the transaction.
I cross-examine Landau.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
No, Marissa.
Wesley is first chair.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.262
Okay, then you don't need me.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.568
Wait! Marissa.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.790
[sighs]

12:27.834 --> 12:29.836
Just give me a minute.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.931
This is not an easy time
to be alive, for anyone.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.803
Every day there seems to be
something new to worry about.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.762
There's this low hum of anxiety

12:42.805 --> 12:44.938
that's become knitted
into the fabric of our lives.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.722
And we're all so used to it,

12:46.766 --> 12:49.333
we think this is the way
life is supposed to feel,

12:49.377 --> 12:50.900
but what I tell my patients

12:50.944 --> 12:53.511
is... it doesn't
have to be like that.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.863
I don't want to treat
just the body

12:56.906 --> 12:58.821
or the mind.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.476
I want to treat the soul.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.956
God, I love your voice.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.958
Did you know

13:05.001 --> 13:08.091
that one in every five people
suffer from chronic anxiety?

13:08.135 --> 13:11.486
-Are you one of those people?
-I didn't think I was, but...

13:11.529 --> 13:12.748
maybe I am.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.055
Well, if you are,
I'm here for you.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.885
I want to help you

13:18.928 --> 13:21.496
feel the kind of spark

13:21.539 --> 13:23.541
you haven't felt in a long time.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.282
[deeply inhales]

13:25.326 --> 13:26.414
[exhales]

13:27.719 --> 13:29.156
Keep talking.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.940
I don't want you
to just be happy.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.942
-Mm.
-I want you to be truly content.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.162
I want you to feel pleasure

13:35.205 --> 13:37.599
in every part of your life.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.861
How's that sound?

13:38.905 --> 13:40.297
Good.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.431
Mm. Really good.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.911
KURT:
Hey.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.352
Kurt. Kurt.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.528
-You're home.
-Yeah. I, uh,

13:53.571 --> 13:56.096
I thought you sounded
a little lost on our last call.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.141
-[chuckling]
-I see you've been missing me.

13:58.185 --> 14:01.275
Well, yeah, yeah,
I am missing you.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.538
Good. I've been
missing you, too.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.931
[both moan]

14:07.716 --> 14:08.848
Let me take a shower.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.285
No. No, cowboy, come on.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.331
-I like you funky. Let's go.
-I smell like an airplane.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.551
Good, let's join
the mile-high club.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.074
-[chuckles]
-Come on.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.815
I'm ready for takeoff.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.122
-[cell phone buzzing]
-DIANE: Oh, no, don't.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.993
No, it's so peaceful.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.560
[Kurt grunts]

14:26.517 --> 14:28.215
Oh.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.173
I have to. It's work.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.047
Yeah. [clears throat]

14:35.309 --> 14:38.268
[sighs] How bad?

14:38.312 --> 14:41.489
We had nothing to do
with that car bomb.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.143
No one knows.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.058
Just be ready
for when the media calls.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.582
"The NRA mourns this

14:47.625 --> 14:49.453
"senseless loss of life,

14:49.497 --> 14:51.455
and our thoughts and prayers are
with the victims, et cetera..."

14:51.499 --> 14:53.631
LYLE:
The world moves
from craziness to craziness.

14:53.675 --> 14:57.200
That's why the most important
thing is inner peace.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.898
That's why I'm here.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.655
Kurt.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.310
Kurt, I want
to tell you something.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.878
All right.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.707
I've been taking this treatment

15:25.750 --> 15:27.665
that I think
you should know about.

15:27.709 --> 15:31.017
It's... it's for anxiety.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.497
I'm sorry, what...

15:33.541 --> 15:35.108
what anxiety?

15:35.151 --> 15:36.631
Well, you know,

15:36.674 --> 15:39.851
since the world fell apart.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.203
I mean, the Cold War,

15:43.246 --> 15:46.206
Roe v. Wade,
civil rights, violence

15:46.249 --> 15:48.164
in the streets, and

15:48.208 --> 15:50.558
I started thinking
a lot about death.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.604
And... it wasn't good.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.866
Why didn't you tell me?

15:54.910 --> 15:56.346
Well, I mean, you weren't here.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.261
And I'm telling you now,

15:58.305 --> 15:59.871
maybe because I feel better.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.483
I-I found something that works.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.093
It's called PT-108.

16:04.137 --> 16:07.488
It's like ketamine,
but it's not as powerful.

16:07.531 --> 16:10.099
Ketamine? Isn't that, like,
a horse tranquilizer?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.536
Well, not in this case.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.451
It's FDA approved,

16:14.495 --> 16:17.324
and it's administered
and supervised by a doctor.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.934
Oh, so, where'd you find
this doctor?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.588
Is this through
somebody you know?

16:21.850 --> 16:23.504
I found it on the Internet.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.549
[scoffs] Well, if you're
not feeling well,

16:25.593 --> 16:26.942
you should go see a real doctor.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.510
We can look
for referrals together.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.556
[sighs] Why are we even
having this discussion?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.210
Because you brought it up,

16:34.254 --> 16:36.647
and... you're taking drugs.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.606
No, I'm not taking drugs.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.216
No. And I'm-- I am not asking

16:40.260 --> 16:42.044
for advice or even help.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.265
I'm just sharing something.
I-I'm sharing a good thing.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.267
-Diane...
-No.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.616
I-I understand

16:48.659 --> 16:50.618
you're concerned
because you care,

16:50.661 --> 16:51.706
and I appreciate it,

16:51.749 --> 16:53.969
but it's-it's okay.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.450
Okay? Let's just...

16:56.493 --> 16:57.712
leave it alone.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.717
[sighs]

17:02.760 --> 17:04.545
SVEN [over earbuds]:
Welcome back toGo Ask Alan,

17:04.588 --> 17:07.069
sponsored by Pages,
Chicago's friendliest bookstore,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.115
and presented
by Room Tone Radio.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.682
And now to our final segment.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.554
The release we're most
anticipating this month is

17:13.597 --> 17:16.122
"Thirty Minute Docket,"
a juicy podcast about cases

17:16.165 --> 17:18.385
within a Chicago law firm.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.169
RI'CHARD [over earbuds]:
I've spent more years of my life

17:20.213 --> 17:22.302
inside the courtroom than out.

17:22.345 --> 17:26.088
Three decades,
426 cases and counting.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.916
-My name is Ri'Chard Lane...
-Oh.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.135
RI'CHARD:
...and I'm a litigator.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.614
[elevator bell dings]

17:47.849 --> 17:50.808
Is-is there... is there
something wrong, Officer?

17:52.332 --> 17:54.073
[elevator bell dings]

17:58.251 --> 18:01.254
RI'CHARD:
We will go from this worship

18:01.297 --> 18:05.040
with the freedom of those
that trust in you.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.563
In the name of Jesus.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.478
Amen.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.133
OTHERS:
Amen.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.528
-Ri'Chard.
-Oh, oh, oh, gentlemen

18:14.571 --> 18:16.225
and madam, this is

18:16.269 --> 18:19.054
my partner, Liz Reddick,
daughter of Carl.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.057
Hello, hello.
Nice to see you all.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.190
Ri'Chard, can we talk
in my office?

18:24.233 --> 18:25.756
-RI'CHARD: Uh...
-Thank you.
So nice to see you all.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.888
Take care. Buh-bye.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.153
[footsteps approaching]

18:31.197 --> 18:32.763
What the fuck are you doing?

18:32.807 --> 18:34.374
I'm...

18:34.417 --> 18:36.289
meeting with local pastors.
New clients.

18:36.332 --> 18:39.030
No. "Thirty Minute Docket"?

18:39.074 --> 18:41.729
Oh. It's just an idea.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.210
Wh-- No.
No, it's not just an idea,

18:44.253 --> 18:46.081
not when I hear it on NPR,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.083
-it's not just an idea.
-It was on NPR?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.086
No. This is a independent...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.784
Ugh, Ri'Chard, this is wrong
on so many levels,

18:53.828 --> 18:55.177
I don't, I don't even know
where to start.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.136
You can't just
take our cases and...

18:57.179 --> 18:59.660
They have fictionalized names,

18:59.703 --> 19:01.140
and I've been checking
with our clients.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.663
-But they're not your cases.
-Right.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.752
That's why I check
with the lawyers involved.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.189
And you just put your name in
instead of theirs?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.844
Well, that's just
good branding, Liz.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.976
The listener needs someone
to identify with.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.544
Oh, my God, you-you don't
even see why this is wrong.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.850
Liz...

19:17.417 --> 19:20.376
This law firm
has to update itself

19:20.420 --> 19:21.508
or be swamped

19:21.551 --> 19:23.074
by the future.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.511
People are drawn

19:24.554 --> 19:26.469
to strength,

19:26.513 --> 19:28.515
and this makes us strong.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.560
We will lose clients.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.084
We've already drawn clients
who have heard

19:33.128 --> 19:34.825
the promo for it.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.827
Just give it a chance, Liz.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.135
Liz, may-maybe it's
an embarrassment, maybe.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.355
No harm, no foul.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.487
You can't just
make decisions by fiat.

19:44.531 --> 19:48.187
This is not "you," this is "we."

19:48.230 --> 19:51.451
This whole law firm
is always "we."

19:51.494 --> 19:54.454
Ubuntu:I am

19:54.497 --> 19:56.195
because we are.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.328
All right.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.243
This is how it works.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.811
You have an idea, any idea,

20:03.854 --> 20:05.639
you want to scratch your ass,

20:05.682 --> 20:07.815
we talk, we discuss,

20:07.858 --> 20:09.338
we agree,

20:09.382 --> 20:10.992
and then you can move forward.

20:11.035 --> 20:14.256
Not before. You need to stop
with this "better to ask

20:14.300 --> 20:16.389
forgiveness than permission"
bullshit.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.042
Do you understand?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.351
Get out of my office.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.493
I want you to come
to dinner tonight.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.103
Why?

20:35.146 --> 20:36.931
Let's get to know each other

20:36.974 --> 20:38.280
personally.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.586
I want to know
what makes you tick.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.240
You can find out what makes

20:41.283 --> 20:42.806
me tick. Come on.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.809
-No.
-Come on. Come on, come on!

20:45.853 --> 20:48.856
-I make a mean Cajun catfish.
-No, I can't.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.161
7:00 p.m.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.989
It'll be my apology.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.165
-We have the Democratic
fundraiser tonight.
-Exactly.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.906
It'll be our excuse.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.822
Then... we won't have to go.

20:58.866 --> 21:01.869
-[chuckling]
-I...

21:03.914 --> 21:05.394
7:00 p.m.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.048
STEVEN:
Mr. Landau, is it
fair to say that,

21:07.091 --> 21:09.485
in the months leading up
to the election of 2020,

21:09.529 --> 21:12.096
you were in constant contact
with Eli Gold

21:12.140 --> 21:14.490
about the campaign strategy
to defeat

21:14.534 --> 21:16.231
Donald Trump?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.277
If you were a Democrat in 2020,
that was Job Number One.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.583
And as part of Job Number One,
did Eli Gold ever propose

21:20.627 --> 21:23.238
breaking into the offices
of Mark Burnett?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.502
-Objection. Hearsay.
-STEVEN: Illinois Rule 803,
hearsay exceptions.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.590
You might look it up,
young lady.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.809
CHASE:
Overruled.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.158
STEVEN:
Please answer, sir.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.202
LANDAU:
I have to acknowledge that

21:31.246 --> 21:32.291
Eli's proposal to break into

21:32.334 --> 21:33.422
The Apprentice'soffice

21:33.466 --> 21:34.815
may have been said in jest.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.730
LANDAU:
Your Honor, non-responsive.

21:36.773 --> 21:39.036
Please instruct the witness
to confine his remarks

21:39.080 --> 21:41.169
-to answering the question.
-That's what he did, Your Honor.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.997
-No, he did not.
-What are you, eight?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.520
The witness is allowed
to contextualize

21:44.564 --> 21:45.434
the defendant's statement
in whatever way he wants.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.828
Witness's remark stands.

21:47.871 --> 21:50.570
STEVEN:
Mr. Landau, was, uh,
the defendant's daughter,

21:50.613 --> 21:52.485
Marissa Gold, ever present when

21:52.528 --> 21:54.922
breaking into Mark Burnett's
office was discussed?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.706
-Objection. Irrelevant.
-Objection, Your Honor.
-CHASE: Overruled.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.273
Sounds pretty relevant to me.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.970
LANDAU:
She was not,

22:00.014 --> 22:02.930
but she was working
as an investigator at the time,

22:02.973 --> 22:05.541
and... he suggested she may have

22:05.585 --> 22:07.108
some tricks of the trade
to share.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.153
Your Honor, move to have
Marissa Gold disqualified

22:09.197 --> 22:10.546
-as defense counsel.
-Based on what?

22:10.590 --> 22:12.069
Based on being called
to testify.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.506
I submit the only reason

22:13.549 --> 22:14.985
she's been made part
of the defense team

22:15.029 --> 22:16.378
is to prevent her
from testifying.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.032
How the fuck
would you know that?

22:18.075 --> 22:20.730
Ms. Gold, I will not tolerate
the use of profanity

22:20.774 --> 22:23.690
from your father or you.
In fact,

22:23.733 --> 22:25.344
I will hear arguments

22:25.387 --> 22:27.433
tomorrow on the motion
to call Marissa Gold

22:27.476 --> 22:28.999
as a witness.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.393
Come in with your
arguments ready.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.395
[gavel bangs]

22:41.534 --> 22:43.405
Can you get the gate for me?

22:43.449 --> 22:44.841
-Oh, sure.
-Thanks.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.669
Thank you.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.674
Do you want a pastry?

22:51.718 --> 22:54.285
They're day-old,
but they're great.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.157
They'll last five minutes
in there.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.854
No, I-I'm fine. Thank you.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.074
Let me get my keys.
Can you hold this?

23:00.117 --> 23:01.597
Uh, sure.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.164
Are you here to see Becky?

23:03.207 --> 23:04.905
Uh, no. Ri'Chard.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.386
Oh, yeah. You're the workmate.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.388
Come on in.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.087
-[door closes]
-NATALEE: Watch out
for the train tracks.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.610
I always trip on them.

23:14.654 --> 23:17.047
Ri'Ch! Your friend is here.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.571
Hold on, let me
set my purse down.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.486
-Sugar!
-Oh.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.750
Oh. Hi. Hi. [chuckles]

23:23.793 --> 23:26.796
Are you here for Ri'Chard?
He's in the kitchen.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.885
-Can I take your shoes?
-Uh, sure.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.844
-Can I, can I put this
down somewhere?
-Uh, your pastries?

23:30.887 --> 23:32.411
The kids really shouldn't
have that much.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.151
-Oh, they're-they're not, uh...
-[screaming]

23:34.195 --> 23:35.762
Oh, sorry, that's Oliver,
he's fine.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.590
Um, can I get you a drink?

23:37.633 --> 23:39.243
Uh, I-I brought, uh,
some wine, so...

23:39.287 --> 23:41.463
We have two specialty drinks:
a Fashionable,

23:41.507 --> 23:43.117
which is Ri'Chard's version
of an old fashioned,

23:43.160 --> 23:44.205
or a spicy sidecar.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.337
Uh, I'll try the Fashionable.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.992
-[screaming]
-One second.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.646
Oliver!

23:53.780 --> 23:56.565
Can I, uh... Oh, wow.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.785
-[chuckles] Whoa.
-Who are you?

23:58.828 --> 24:01.527
Uh, I'm... I, uh,
I'm-I'm Liz Reddick.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.746
-I'm...
-You really shouldn't be
giving the kids sugar,

24:03.790 --> 24:05.269
-not this close to bedtime.
-Oh, no.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.967
The-- Some-Someone else
handed this to me.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.882
Uh, can you point me
in the direction of Ri'Chard?

24:08.925 --> 24:11.058
You'll have to take off
your shoes first.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.979
Oh, hey, uh,
you're not supposed to have,

24:19.022 --> 24:21.851
uh... Oh, you know what?
You're not my kids.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.636
Okay.

24:23.679 --> 24:26.203
RI'CHARD:
No more pastries.
What's going on out there?

24:26.247 --> 24:27.640
I want these kids to eat.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.729
-Ri'Chard?
-RI'CHARD: Oh, hey, Liz.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.687
Come on in.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.341
-Oh, here's your drink.
-Oh. [laughs]

24:33.384 --> 24:35.256
I am so happy to meet
Ri'Chard's work wife.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.519
Oh, thank you. It's...

24:37.563 --> 24:39.826
-nice... to meet you, too.
-Let's go. Upstairs.

24:39.869 --> 24:43.220
-Hey.
-Too spicy or just spicy enough?

24:47.094 --> 24:50.184
-Oh. Mmm. It's just enough.
It's good.
-[laughs]

24:50.227 --> 24:52.273
Sorry about all the chaos.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.753
It was supposed to be
family game night,

24:53.796 --> 24:55.537
but someone
didn't read the calendar.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.365
It wasn't on the calendar.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.889
[speaking French]

25:01.500 --> 25:02.805
How's your drink?

25:02.849 --> 25:04.590
Oh, it's, uh...

25:06.461 --> 25:08.071
Ah, it's good. [laughs]

25:08.115 --> 25:10.247
That's-that's good.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.729
So, is, uh, your house
always this confusing?

25:13.773 --> 25:16.515
RI'CHARD:
Ah, diplomatic word. A house
is always warmer when there are

25:16.558 --> 25:17.820
more people in it,
don't you think?

25:17.864 --> 25:20.127
[laughs] Uh, are, uh,

25:20.170 --> 25:22.564
-all of these your children?
-Uh, no, uh,

25:22.608 --> 25:24.784
some of them.
Uh, some are neighbors.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.003
I found I never had
to worry about my kids

25:27.047 --> 25:28.744
if I made our house the most

25:28.788 --> 25:30.093
-fun one on the block.
-Mm-hmm.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.660
-Then all the friends came here.
-Yeah.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.575
-Uh, how many kids do you have?
-Oh, just one.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.883
Uh, well, you should've
brought, um, him? Her?

25:36.926 --> 25:39.363
Him. Him.
No, he's-he's-he's with his dad.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.975
Oh, th-that's right, you're
divorced. Oof. I could never

25:42.018 --> 25:43.759
-do that.
-Why?

25:43.803 --> 25:45.152
RI'CHARD:
I, um,

25:45.195 --> 25:48.808
have trouble ending things.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.725
Jesus is Lord.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.161
All authority
in heaven and earth.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.163
RI'CHARD:
Oh, the bottle's in the fridge.

25:56.206 --> 25:59.558
I thought you two were going to
that Democratic thing tonight.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.298
RI'CHARD:
Uh, we decided

26:01.342 --> 26:04.301
to stay home and, um, talk.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.781
Talk about what?

26:05.825 --> 26:08.610
[chuckles]
Why we hate each other so much.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.569
[laughing]

26:11.961 --> 26:14.660
[laughter]

26:14.703 --> 26:17.053
-Hello, Democrats.
-[audience cheers, applauds]

26:18.228 --> 26:19.882
Welcome.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.541
Now, isn't it nice to be

26:26.585 --> 26:28.674
in a room filled
with people who believe

26:28.717 --> 26:31.677
-in democracy
and free elections...
-[cheering, applause]

26:31.720 --> 26:34.418
and climate change
and freedom of expression?

26:34.462 --> 26:36.943

on a college campus recently?

LANDAU:
Our first performers
tonight were

26:41.251 --> 26:43.689
devastated when their show got
shut down because of COVID...

26:43.732 --> 26:45.647
You all right?

26:45.691 --> 26:48.302
I just hate hypocrisy.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.652
MARISSA:
Really? That's new.

[laughs]

28:30.273 --> 28:32.406
What are the ethics of this?

28:32.449 --> 28:34.713
The ethics of standing
next to each other

I think we're okay.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.020
Okay, but I don't want
to break any rules.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.850
So, how are you?

28:41.894 --> 28:43.765
You mean after the treatment

28:43.809 --> 28:46.768
-or after the explosion?
-Both.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.596
Let's say both.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.859
Blissfully neutral.

Not a bad thing.

29:01.174 --> 29:03.872
Come back to you?
Yes, I want to come back.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.788
I-I think it helps.
Don't you?

29:06.832 --> 29:09.791
-Think it helps? Yes.
-Mm.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.837
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.578
You're always so calm.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.407
Do you-- Do you take
your own treatment?

29:17.451 --> 29:19.932
No. If I had a need, I would,

29:19.975 --> 29:22.282
but I haven't yet.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.023
But, you know, let's give it
a couple of years.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.676
[chuckles]

29:25.720 --> 29:27.809
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I found it in the car.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.813
Oh, good. Uh, uh, Diane and I
were just talking.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.554
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.556
I'm Alyssa.
Nice to meet you.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.906
And you.
I really should get back.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.908
Yeah, us, too. They'll be
passing around the hat

29:39.952 --> 29:42.781
pretty soon-- health care,
health care, health care.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.870
-[laughs]
-See you, Diane.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.610
Bye.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.177
ELI:
They're using you

29:48.221 --> 29:49.875
to send me to prison.
Are you okay with that?

29:49.918 --> 29:51.702
LANDAU:
What, you think
I wanted to testify?

29:51.746 --> 29:54.053
And as far as who can avoid
prison, I have

29:54.096 --> 29:55.924
-the utmost faith that it's you.
-Dad, come on, let's go.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.797
Look, Frank, is it
an apology you want?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.668
-Is that what this is about?
-What are you talking about?

30:00.711 --> 30:03.497
Dad, this entire conversation
can end up in court. Come on.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.846
Listen to your daughter, Eli.

30:04.890 --> 30:08.284
You're hurting yourself.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.504
Dad, stop.
Why are you doing this? Stop.

30:10.547 --> 30:13.202
Do not follow me
into the men's room.

30:13.246 --> 30:16.075
[quartet continues singing]

30:16.118 --> 30:18.991
You think I betrayed you
with the president.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.688
-Let it lie, Eli.
-I did you a favor.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.124
As soon as Biden tanked
in the polls,

30:22.168 --> 30:23.517
you would have been
put out to pasture.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.040
Jesus Christ,
can I have some peace?

30:25.084 --> 30:26.781
Tell me you don't think
you're gonna be rewarded

30:26.825 --> 30:28.174
for giving me up.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.175
Tell me you're not
that fucking naive.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.959
You did this to yourself.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.482
When I found out
you were serious...

30:32.526 --> 30:34.876
Die, Eli Gold, you fucking Jew!

30:37.879 --> 30:39.881
[Eli panting]

30:53.895 --> 30:56.245
[siren wailing]

30:56.289 --> 30:59.466
Thanks for coming over.

30:59.509 --> 31:02.904
Did we settle anything?

31:02.948 --> 31:07.778
No... but it was interesting.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.998
-It was.
-Yeah.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.044
Next time we should probably
get drunk.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.393
[chuckles]

31:13.436 --> 31:15.743
-Here.
-Oh, yeah.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.356
Oh, God, we are one with you.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.402
[phone alert beeping]

31:22.445 --> 31:24.708
What is that?
Amber Alert?

31:24.752 --> 31:26.928
Um...

31:26.972 --> 31:29.104
-[alert stops]
-Oh, God.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.106
It's some kind of shooting
near here.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.848
-Some protest shooting.
-Oh, my God.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.415
It's at the Democratic
fundraiser.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.070
One casualty.
Francis Landau.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.767
Head of the Democratic
Committee?

31:39.810 --> 31:41.900
Oh, my God, yeah.
I-I know him.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.381
Downtown is on lockdown until
the shooter is apprehended.

31:45.425 --> 31:48.297
20-block radius
around the ballroom.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.344
We're ten blocks
from the Straton.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.912
You should probably make
yourself comfortable.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.739
You're gonna be stuck here
for a while.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.567
Oh, God.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.526
[siren wailing]

31:59.569 --> 32:01.702
[indistinct chatter]

32:22.810 --> 32:26.596
Dad, can I get you anything?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.381
Dad?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.952
Oh, it was so weird.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.824
I was right beside him.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.391
And this guy just
came up behind us

32:38.434 --> 32:42.612
and said, "Die, you filthy Jew,
Eli Gold."

32:42.656 --> 32:44.919
Eli Gold.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.529
He thought he was killing me.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.404
The world has gone crazy, Dad.

32:51.447 --> 32:55.016
But Frank's dead because of me.

32:55.060 --> 32:58.150
He's not even Jewish.
He's...

32:58.193 --> 33:00.761
He's got three kids.

33:00.804 --> 33:05.113
And he's, like, Presbyterian...
something or other.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.205
I'm glad you're alive, Dad.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.950
-Did you see him leave?
-Who, the shooter?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.430
-Uh-huh.
-No.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.127
I heard the sound. I didn't know
it was a gunshot.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.564
I thought it was a garbage can
falling or something.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.523
And I turned to the door,

33:23.566 --> 33:25.133
but there was a crowd
in the way.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.354
What am I doing with my life?

33:28.397 --> 33:30.834
What? What do you mean?

33:30.878 --> 33:33.315
People hate me.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.623
They hate me so much,
they want to kill me.

33:36.666 --> 33:40.192
Dad, they want to kill us
because we're Jewish. Okay?

33:40.235 --> 33:41.889
You could be selling pretzels
on the street,

33:41.932 --> 33:43.325
they'd still want to kill you.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.284
No. It's like Lee Atwater.
Remember him?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.677
At the end he-he apologized.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.941
He had, uh, brain cancer
or something,

33:50.985 --> 33:55.946
but he died and-and he said,
"I'm sorry for Willie Horton."

33:59.080 --> 34:01.604
You come into the world...

34:01.648 --> 34:03.432
wanting to make it
a better place,

34:03.476 --> 34:06.566
and you end up
just making a mess.

34:13.138 --> 34:16.489
You make a difference, Dad.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.100
You make a difference
to me, anyway.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.149
If I die, you'll be there,
right?

34:25.454 --> 34:28.588
-You'll give the eulogy?
-Dad.

34:28.631 --> 34:30.285
You're not dying.

34:31.765 --> 34:35.464
We just live in
a bad time, Marissa.

34:35.508 --> 34:38.119
I've got to change my life.
I've got to stop.

34:38.163 --> 34:42.210
I've got to... confess.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.431
Confess what?

34:45.474 --> 34:48.564
Everything. What I did.

34:48.608 --> 34:52.220
No, you don't. Dad, no.

34:52.264 --> 34:55.876
Mr. Gold, can we talk
to you over here?

34:55.919 --> 34:57.878
Dad, just say what you saw.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.184
Okay? Don't say anything else.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.403
I'll drive you home.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.675
All right, so...

35:14.155 --> 35:16.157
I have to ask this question.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.379
Which one of them
are you married to?

35:20.422 --> 35:22.163
Which one is your wife?

35:22.207 --> 35:25.166
-[laughs]
-Well, I-I-I-I must have seen,
what, four?

35:25.210 --> 35:28.648
I needed a cheat sheet
to keep track.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.738
Uh, will it offend you
if I told you

35:31.781 --> 35:34.480
-none of them?
-None of them?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.699
What is this, a commune?

35:36.743 --> 35:38.527
Just a loving household.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.747
And you're a Christian?

35:40.790 --> 35:42.879
Born in the blood of Christ.

35:42.923 --> 35:46.405
[chuckling]:
Okay.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.494
My wife died.

35:52.237 --> 35:56.284
One is her sister,
one is her friend.

35:56.328 --> 36:00.070
One is my friend,
one's a college dropout.

36:00.114 --> 36:03.900
Um, I-I collect female energy.

36:06.642 --> 36:10.777
Watch out, women have dinner
here and never leave.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.735
-[laughs]
-Don't knock it.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.302
You might just like it.

36:14.346 --> 36:17.175
Okay, all right, well,

36:17.218 --> 36:22.310
since we're bearing our souls
to each other,

36:22.354 --> 36:24.530
what are you in this for?

36:24.573 --> 36:26.445
Is it the money?

36:26.488 --> 36:28.534
What-what are we talking about?
The women?

36:28.577 --> 36:30.318
No, no.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.146
Reddick and Associates.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.713
Oh.

36:35.584 --> 36:39.458
Power. Respect.
Independence.

36:39.501 --> 36:43.157
Uh, branding my name.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.637
What about you?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.856
No, let me guess.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.512
You're into this for
your father's legacy.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.732
Oh, my God, no.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.300
No.
[chuckles]

36:55.343 --> 36:57.998
No, I always wanted to be

36:58.041 --> 37:00.740
the opposite of my father.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.961
When he was a defense lawyer,
I became a prosecutor.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.616
When he was representing
Goliaths,

37:07.660 --> 37:10.358
I represented Davids.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.578
That's what I like about you.

37:12.621 --> 37:16.277
-[siren wailing]
-That rebellious spirit.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.192
That's what makes you hot.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.413
[laughs]:
Oh... God.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.675
You're so funny.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.372
-I...
-Why is that?

37:24.416 --> 37:27.462
Well, but you-you...
you don't know it's too much

37:27.506 --> 37:28.898
until you push it.

37:28.942 --> 37:33.033
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that sounds about right.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.383
When I first started my career,

37:35.427 --> 37:37.298
I wasn't so polished.

37:37.342 --> 37:40.127
I didn't care because
I knew I was smart.

37:40.170 --> 37:44.174
I could win any debate,
so what did it matter

37:44.218 --> 37:47.265
how I presented myself
or what I wore?

37:47.308 --> 37:49.136
Well, you've changed.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.703
Yeah.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.490
Right out of law school,
I got to the final round

37:55.534 --> 38:00.147
of interviews at my dream firm,
and the partner,

38:00.190 --> 38:04.499
ooh, he brought me
into the board room,

38:04.543 --> 38:08.547
and there, in front of all
the other partners,

38:08.590 --> 38:11.724
he pulled out a laser pointer
and he pointed it

38:11.767 --> 38:15.118
at every part of me.

38:15.162 --> 38:20.036
Explaining how
someone with shoes like that

38:20.080 --> 38:21.255
could never survive.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.345
How someone with this haircut

38:24.389 --> 38:27.130
would be laughed out
of client meetings.

38:27.174 --> 38:30.438
How someone in a...
[laughs]

38:30.482 --> 38:34.399
in a polyester suit, like mine,

38:34.442 --> 38:37.402
would end up in the gutter.

38:37.445 --> 38:40.230
I was trash.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.191
Sorry.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.672
Yeah, but it was an incentive.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.021
I'm sure everybody has
an incentive.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.414
[murmurs]

38:49.457 --> 38:51.720
That was the day
I told myself,

38:51.764 --> 38:54.114
"I will show him."

38:55.333 --> 38:59.424
"I will be everything
he said I wasn't."

38:59.467 --> 39:04.211
And that's how I ended up here
with you

39:04.254 --> 39:07.432
in a $10,000 suit

39:07.475 --> 39:10.086
drinking a $900 bottle
of wine.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.437
[murmurs]

39:12.480 --> 39:14.134
[phone chimes]

39:15.875 --> 39:19.618
Oh, well, it looks like
we have the all clear.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.797
All right, well, um...

39:28.453 --> 39:30.063
...this has been
very illuminating.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.413
I'm glad you approved.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.937
Yeah. Oh, gosh, okay.

39:34.981 --> 39:36.939
Well...

39:36.983 --> 39:40.378
I will, um, see you at work.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.032
I'll see you at work.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.909
God, nothing seems real
right now.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.955
Or lasting.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.394
You okay?

40:01.137 --> 40:04.445
I-I was talking to someone
at my table afterwards,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.142
after the shooting,

40:06.186 --> 40:08.406
'cause we were all
just stuck there,

40:08.449 --> 40:10.364
and this person brought up
the connection

40:10.408 --> 40:14.673
-between love and death.
-Huh?

40:14.716 --> 40:18.154
It's like
in-in Tristan and Isolde.

40:18.198 --> 40:21.027
Their love is so intense, it-it,

40:21.070 --> 40:25.466
you know, it can last
even after they die.

40:25.510 --> 40:30.340
You don't know what I mean,
do you?

40:30.384 --> 40:33.474
Diane, I think you're
asking me questions

40:33.518 --> 40:37.173
that you know I don't
know the answer to.

40:37.217 --> 40:40.133
And I'm not sure why.

40:40.176 --> 40:43.092
I'm not here
for a literature test.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.399
I'm here 'cause I love you.

40:46.966 --> 40:51.405
You know who I am.
You know what I'm good at.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.451
What I care about.

40:58.238 --> 41:00.066
Do you love me?

41:00.109 --> 41:02.460
Yes.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.346
Have I passed the test?

41:19.389 --> 41:21.566
[Diane chuckles]

41:21.609 --> 41:23.872
Yes.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.578
STEVEN:
We need her, Your Honor.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.753
We don't have Frank Landau

41:34.796 --> 41:36.406
anymore for tragic reasons.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.539
Marissa Gold is alive and well

41:38.583 --> 41:40.019
and able to testify.

41:40.062 --> 41:41.542
Is that your only argument--
you need her?

41:41.586 --> 41:44.110
Circumstances have changed.
A man died.

41:44.153 --> 41:45.720
And as far as I can tell,
only one person

41:45.764 --> 41:47.200
stood to benefit
from his murder.

41:47.243 --> 41:49.115
Excuse me, what the fuck?

41:49.158 --> 41:51.639
-Ms. Gold.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but what is he implying?

41:51.683 --> 41:54.250
Fox News reported that
Eli Gold was arguing violently

41:54.294 --> 41:57.558
-with the victim
just before the murder.
-I was there.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.821
The gunman's target
was my father, not Frank Landau.

41:59.865 --> 42:00.909
So he claims, anyways.

42:00.953 --> 42:02.563
Oh, my God, are you nuts?

42:02.607 --> 42:04.739
-Let's keep this
respectful, please.
-Tell him.

42:04.783 --> 42:06.436
He's implying my father
killed someone.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.048
I saw my dad's shirt
covered with Landau's brains.

42:09.091 --> 42:10.963
Your Honor, look at that table.
How many lawyers

42:11.006 --> 42:12.486
does one man need,
especially if he's

42:12.530 --> 42:14.183
as innocent as he pretends.

42:14.227 --> 42:17.578
Mr. Gold is allowed to choose
his own defense team.

42:17.622 --> 42:20.625
Hold on!
I'm ready to rule.

42:20.668 --> 42:21.974
Prosecution has made
a compelling argument,

42:22.017 --> 42:24.759
and I'm granting the motion.

42:24.803 --> 42:28.720
Ms. Gold, get ready to testify.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.728
This can work.

42:36.771 --> 42:37.990
RI'CHARD:
Good.

42:38.033 --> 42:40.775
Uh, we thought it might.

42:42.342 --> 42:45.388
[clears throat]
It's very generous of you
to, uh, give up

42:45.432 --> 42:47.086
a portion of your bonuses.

42:47.129 --> 42:49.479
Well, it's worth it
for the goodwill of the firm.

42:49.523 --> 42:51.438
It might still be
a little tight,

42:51.481 --> 42:53.527
but there are other places
I can pinch from.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.964
Well, go ahead and pinch.
[chuckles]

42:56.008 --> 42:58.314
Yeah, I-I must say,
it's great to see you two

42:58.358 --> 42:59.664
have united on this.

42:59.707 --> 43:01.013
It'll be a big relief
for the partners.

43:01.056 --> 43:03.189
-There have been grumblings.
-Anytime.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.716
-Good job, Liz.
-You, too.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.589
[overlapping shouting]

43:11.632 --> 43:13.286
Hey.

43:13.329 --> 43:14.896
How's it going down there?

43:14.940 --> 43:16.637
As far as I can tell,
there's just more people

43:16.681 --> 43:18.247
and more arrests.

43:18.291 --> 43:20.772
JAY:
Yeah, the assassination
last night.

43:20.815 --> 43:22.861
They're blocking off
the lobby today.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.689
Everybody's being directed out
through the loading dock.

43:24.732 --> 43:27.474
Okay, well, that makes sense.
Just keep us posted

43:27.517 --> 43:29.084
if there's anything
that we need to do.

43:29.128 --> 43:31.260
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay?

43:31.304 --> 43:33.480
I dug deeper into Ri'Chard.

43:33.523 --> 43:34.742
I thought you'd want
to hear about it.

43:34.786 --> 43:37.832
Oh, God, yeah, I...
I almost forgot.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.791
-What do you, what do you have?
-Past history.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.401
He has history with the firm.

43:41.444 --> 43:43.142
-What firm?
-Ours.

43:43.185 --> 43:45.231
When your dad was running it.

43:46.188 --> 43:47.625
Really?

43:47.668 --> 43:49.322
Ri'Chard was
a first-year associate,

43:49.365 --> 43:52.107
he applied here, and your father
wouldn't hire him.

43:52.151 --> 43:54.283
In fact, Ri'Chard filed

43:54.327 --> 43:56.372
a class discrimination suit
against him,

43:56.416 --> 43:58.723
but Reddick used his contacts
to quash the suit

43:58.766 --> 44:01.203
before it became public.

44:01.247 --> 44:03.858
Ri'Chard told me last night that

44:03.902 --> 44:06.861
he got rejected
from his first firm

44:06.905 --> 44:08.776
because his clothes
looked cheap,

44:08.820 --> 44:12.606
and he said the partner...
called him trash.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.174
Mm, yeah,
that's probably your dad.

44:16.175 --> 44:17.829
Did he mention that?

44:17.872 --> 44:19.439
No.

44:21.310 --> 44:23.225
Do you think he's here
with some secret agenda?

44:23.269 --> 44:25.706
LIZ:
I don't know.

44:25.750 --> 44:28.056
What would it be?

44:40.025 --> 44:41.287
[knock on door]

44:43.245 --> 44:44.638
Do you have a minute?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.293
Uh, Marissa,
this is not the best time.

44:47.336 --> 44:50.078
Could we, uh, talk tomorrow?

44:50.122 --> 44:53.995
I have to testify against
my dad today, so not so much.

44:54.039 --> 44:56.737
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

44:56.781 --> 44:59.740
[explosion outside]

44:59.784 --> 45:01.568
-God, it's getting worse,
isn't it?
-Yeah.

45:01.611 --> 45:03.570
-Thought it'd be over by now.
-Yeah.

45:05.224 --> 45:07.095
[Marissa sighs]

45:07.139 --> 45:09.184
So, I figure you've heard
about this case against my dad.

45:09.228 --> 45:10.490
I have.

45:10.533 --> 45:12.187
The judge is making me testify

45:12.231 --> 45:14.189
now that the prosecution
doesn't have Landau.

45:14.233 --> 45:16.714
And the things they're gonna
ask me about are

45:16.757 --> 45:18.498
things I did.

45:18.541 --> 45:21.631
-Did you know what your father
was gonna do?
-No.

45:21.675 --> 45:25.244
He kept me in the dark.
Unsurprising.

45:25.287 --> 45:30.162
But if I tell the truth,
it'll be bad for him,

45:30.205 --> 45:32.512
and if I withhold the truth...

45:32.555 --> 45:34.993
You would be perjuring yourself.

45:35.036 --> 45:38.257
And jeopardizing my law license,
which I know I've only had it

45:38.300 --> 45:41.347
for a couple months,
but I kind of like it.

45:41.390 --> 45:42.522
Well, I'm sorry, Marissa,
I can't advise you

45:42.565 --> 45:44.045
to perjure yourself.

45:44.089 --> 45:45.743
I know.

45:48.702 --> 45:52.010
If it's okay, I wanted to ask
about your father.

45:52.053 --> 45:53.968
You know,
since we're both in the

45:54.012 --> 45:56.797
ethically-compromised
dads club.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.886
It's not a very fun club
to be in, is it?

45:58.930 --> 46:01.367
It sucks.

46:01.410 --> 46:04.631
When we uncovered that stuff
about your dad and the women,

46:04.674 --> 46:08.243
you asked me to find out
how many more there were.

46:08.287 --> 46:09.723
I did that.

46:09.767 --> 46:14.728
I put it in a folder
and gave it to you.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.818
Did you ever read it?

46:17.862 --> 46:20.908
-How will that answer help you?
-I don't know if it will.

46:20.952 --> 46:23.345
I-I'm-I'm just trying
to figure out what...

46:23.389 --> 46:25.217
Uh, no.

46:27.785 --> 46:31.353
No, I didn't read it.

46:37.925 --> 46:39.753
[explosion outside]

46:42.451 --> 46:43.888
DIANE:
Eli.

46:43.931 --> 46:45.324
You look lost.

46:45.367 --> 46:48.066
Marissa will be here
in a minute.

46:50.938 --> 46:52.766
It's getting bad down there.

46:52.810 --> 46:57.118
Yeah, it is.

46:57.162 --> 46:58.772
I'm so sorry about Frank.

46:58.816 --> 47:02.210
I am, too.

47:04.082 --> 47:05.300
They were coming for me.

47:05.344 --> 47:06.301
I know.

47:06.345 --> 47:07.955
[explosion outside]

47:07.999 --> 47:09.652
Do you have any protection?

47:09.696 --> 47:12.177
I-I have a few guards
down by the car.

47:12.220 --> 47:13.526
I have 'em for a couple days,

47:13.569 --> 47:15.397
then their contracts
will run out.

47:15.441 --> 47:17.617
It feels weird.
I'm-I'm a mechanic.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.227
I'm not a public figure.

47:19.271 --> 47:21.882
We're all public figures now.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.450
Come on in.

47:24.493 --> 47:28.802
Sure. Why not? Let's drink.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.456
Cheers.

47:30.499 --> 47:33.676
[both laughing]

47:41.641 --> 47:44.557
Was there a better time, or
has it always been like this?

47:44.600 --> 47:48.039
I don't know. Whenever I'm
smack-dab in the middle

47:48.082 --> 47:50.389
of the time, I always think
it's the worst time,

47:50.432 --> 47:53.044
and then, I don't know,
five years later I think,

47:53.087 --> 47:55.611
"Huh, that was
a pretty good time."

47:59.877 --> 48:03.184
-I fell apart today.
-Well, that makes sense.

48:03.228 --> 48:06.666
A person was murdered
right beside you.

48:06.709 --> 48:08.146
And they thought they were
murdering me.

48:08.189 --> 48:12.672
Yeah, so how could you not
fall apart?

48:14.239 --> 48:18.069
I've been wondering how much
I've been contributing

48:18.112 --> 48:19.592
to all this.

48:19.635 --> 48:21.811
Turning the opposition
into the enemy,

48:21.855 --> 48:24.292
turning the enemy
into psychopaths.

48:24.336 --> 48:26.338
Eli, you're not the one
who assaulted the Capitol.

48:26.381 --> 48:27.861
How do we get out of this?

48:27.905 --> 48:29.863
They're shouting,
so do we just shout louder?

48:29.907 --> 48:34.955
I don't know, but if we don't
shout back, they'll win.

48:34.999 --> 48:39.438
And when they win,
they will trash everything.

48:39.481 --> 48:41.135
Oh, my God, I am so exhausted.

48:41.179 --> 48:45.270
Okay, so...

48:45.313 --> 48:47.663
here's what I suggest.

48:47.707 --> 48:51.624
Finish your drink, stand up,
pull yourself together,

48:51.667 --> 48:53.626
and go out there
and kick some ass.

48:55.106 --> 48:57.760
This country is worth
fighting for; it always was.

48:57.804 --> 49:01.590
And our enemies want to
stop voting from happening.

49:01.634 --> 49:04.811
That's not just galling,
that is the end of America.

49:04.854 --> 49:07.205
And we can't let that happen.

49:11.165 --> 49:13.254
Where do you find
your optimism?

49:13.298 --> 49:16.214
In a hallucinogenic drug
called PT-108.

49:16.257 --> 49:18.520
[laughs]

49:19.869 --> 49:23.047
-Are you joking?
-No.

49:23.090 --> 49:27.051
Tell me if you want me to set up
an appointment for you.

49:27.094 --> 49:29.488
Eli, I need you to fight
the good fight.

49:29.531 --> 49:32.926
I need to know that
there is someone out there

49:32.970 --> 49:34.754
who can quarterback the game.

49:34.797 --> 49:38.018
Because I know our politicians
aren't up to it.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.585
It has to be you.

49:39.628 --> 49:43.458
The person behind the scene.

49:43.502 --> 49:46.200
I'm sorry, if you want me to
contribute to your bodyguards,

49:46.244 --> 49:48.942
I will, but you have
to get back in the fight.

49:49.943 --> 49:51.423
MARISSA:
Hey.

49:51.466 --> 49:54.252
Marissa Gold, how are you?

49:54.295 --> 49:57.298
-Better now.
-Why?

49:57.342 --> 49:59.431
'Cause I was listening
to you two,

49:59.474 --> 50:03.043
and I decided something.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.958
Let's get to court, Dad.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.397
Okay, daughter.

50:15.229 --> 50:17.492
[power drill whirring]

50:24.238 --> 50:27.589
Hello, you must be Diane.

50:27.633 --> 50:31.071
Oh. Hi.

50:31.115 --> 50:33.943
-It's you.
-Ye-Yes, hi.

50:33.987 --> 50:36.120
I'm here for my session
with Dr. Bettencourt.

50:36.163 --> 50:37.860
Yes, I know.

50:37.904 --> 50:40.124
I'm sorry, we met
at the fundraiser.

50:40.167 --> 50:41.690
That was awful, wasn't it?

50:41.734 --> 50:42.865
The shooting, yes.

50:42.909 --> 50:44.911
Anyway, I'm Dr. Alyssa Schuman.

50:44.954 --> 50:47.827
Dr. Bettencourt had to go
out of town last minute,

50:47.870 --> 50:49.524
take care of a personal matter.

50:49.568 --> 50:51.744
So I'm filling in.
[chuckles]

50:51.787 --> 50:53.876
Do you have any idea when
Dr. Bettencourt will be back?

50:53.920 --> 50:57.054
Not as of now, but
we'll keep you posted.

50:57.097 --> 50:59.752
May I offer you
some cucumber water?

50:59.795 --> 51:01.841
No.

51:03.234 --> 51:05.279
Then let's get you hooked up.

51:07.020 --> 51:09.283
My father is brilliant
at certain things

51:09.327 --> 51:12.025
but a disaster at others.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.505
I guarantee you

51:13.548 --> 51:14.854
he thought Pegasus
was just a winged horse

51:14.897 --> 51:16.421
until you brought these charges.

51:16.464 --> 51:18.510
Ms. Gold, do you know
the meaning of perjury?

51:18.553 --> 51:19.772
Objection.

51:19.815 --> 51:20.773
Seriously?

51:20.816 --> 51:22.557
Sustained.

51:22.601 --> 51:23.689
STEVEN:
Okay, I'll ask you directly.

51:23.732 --> 51:25.691
Did Eli Gold ask you

51:25.734 --> 51:29.521
to get ahold of a copy
of the security system Pegasus?

51:29.564 --> 51:32.741
My dad calls me
for technical advice sometimes.

51:32.785 --> 51:35.570
I've explained to him
how to embed images

51:35.614 --> 51:37.529
in emails or tweets,

51:37.572 --> 51:40.053
which, by the way,
he still calls "twitters."

51:40.097 --> 51:42.099
[chuckling]

51:42.142 --> 51:43.143
You do that, too?

51:43.187 --> 51:44.971
-Guilty.
-[chuckles softly]

51:45.014 --> 51:47.234
I've helped him
set up Zoom calls.

51:47.278 --> 51:50.629
But I've never helped him spy
or hack, and I certainly

51:50.672 --> 51:53.501
-haven't helped him use Pegasus.
-Ms. Gold,
if you're telling the truth,

51:53.545 --> 51:56.025
then why did Frank Landau
believe that you were involved

51:56.069 --> 51:57.288
-in the attempted burglary?
-Mr. Kirkpatrick

51:57.331 --> 51:58.898
is about to object
on the grounds

51:58.941 --> 52:01.379
that your question calls
for speculation.

52:01.422 --> 52:04.033
I suspect Judge Chase
would sustain that objection

52:04.077 --> 52:06.035
and tell me not to answer you.

52:06.079 --> 52:09.648
But I would like to try
to answer your question.

52:12.041 --> 52:13.478
Go ahead.

52:14.435 --> 52:18.483
