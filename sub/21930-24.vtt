WEBVTT

00:01.872 --> 00:03.956
All right, Saturday
is the big day.

00:03.958 --> 00:05.924
A lot of people thought
this would never come.

00:05.926 --> 00:07.960
I may have been
one of those people.

00:08.763 --> 00:11.296
I may have been
one of those people.

00:11.298 --> 00:12.631
Wait, wait, are we talking
about the wedding?

00:12.633 --> 00:13.112
Yes.

00:13.136 --> 00:15.018
Oh, yeah, I was definitely
one of those people.

00:15.019 --> 00:16.435
And yet, here we are.

00:16.437 --> 00:18.604
Now, we got a lot of family
coming in tomorrow.

00:18.606 --> 00:19.888
I'm gonna need everyone's help.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.974
Think of this as one of
your comic book movies.

00:21.976 --> 00:24.143
There's a bunch of superheroes,
each with a different task.

00:24.145 --> 00:25.644
Oh, like
the new Avengers.

00:25.646 --> 00:26.862
Which one was that?

00:26.864 --> 00:29.198
The one you slept through
last weekend.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.984
Oh, that was
a good nap.

00:31.986 --> 00:35.654
I-I think it's more like, uh,
like Lord of the Rings,

00:35.656 --> 00:36.955
and you're the Fellowship.

00:36.957 --> 00:38.791
Uh, someone's
got to go to Gondor,

00:38.793 --> 00:40.209
someone's got to go to Mordor,

00:40.211 --> 00:42.745
someone's got to hold off
the demon of shadow and flame.

00:42.747 --> 00:44.129
You mean the Balrog?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.465
I mean my mother.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.000
That is a perfect
metaphor, Amy.

00:48.002 --> 00:49.384
Thank you.

00:49.386 --> 00:51.303
Because it also involves a ring

00:51.305 --> 00:54.256
that binds me
in servitude forever.

00:54.258 --> 00:55.443
Aw, he said forever.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.289
That was Wil Wheaton.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.424
He's really excited
about tomorrow.

01:26.426 --> 01:28.159
As am I.

01:28.161 --> 01:31.712
If you'd have told me as a child
that an actor from Star Trek

01:31.714 --> 01:34.432
would be officiating my wedding,
I would've said,

01:34.434 --> 01:36.851
"Ooh, William Shatner?"

01:37.871 --> 01:39.637
And if you'd have said,
"No, Wil Wheaton,"

01:39.639 --> 01:41.939
I'd have said, "Well, did you
even try William Shatner?"

01:41.941 --> 01:43.558
And if you'd have said,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.643
"Yes, but he costs too much
money," I'd have said,

01:45.645 --> 01:47.645
"Ah, well,
Wil Wheaton's good, too."

01:47.647 --> 01:50.481
Why do you keep tying
and untying that bow tie?

01:50.483 --> 01:52.984
I can't seem to get it even.

01:52.986 --> 01:54.869
Well, I don't think
it's supposed to be even.

01:54.871 --> 01:56.787
Sometimes a little asymmetry
looks good.

01:56.789 --> 01:59.073
In the Renaissance,
they called it "sprezzatura."

01:59.075 --> 02:00.908
The Renaissance?

02:00.910 --> 02:04.128
Amy, you know I'm more
of an Enlightenment person.

02:04.130 --> 02:05.830
At some point, we have to decide

02:05.832 --> 02:07.999
how we want to raise
the children.

02:08.001 --> 02:11.135
So are you feeling okay?

02:11.137 --> 02:13.254
No wedding jitters?

02:13.256 --> 02:14.422
No.

02:14.424 --> 02:16.340
There is nothing
in the world

02:16.342 --> 02:18.142
that would stop me from
marrying you tomorrow,

02:18.144 --> 02:22.680
even me from the future coming
back to prevent the wedding

02:22.682 --> 02:26.567
and the subsequent birth of a
child who will destroy humanity.

02:26.569 --> 02:29.070
Because if you came
from the future,

02:29.072 --> 02:31.189
that would mean you already
went through with the wedding

02:31.191 --> 02:33.858
because you believe that
time travel is on a closed loop.

02:33.860 --> 02:36.527
I love you
so damn much.

02:41.334 --> 02:43.034
Uh, Mr. Fowler,
are you okay back there?

02:43.036 --> 02:44.202
Do you need more air?

02:44.204 --> 02:46.671
He's fine.

02:47.707 --> 02:49.624
I'm surprised
Amy didn't pick us up.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.259
Oh, well, you know,

02:51.261 --> 02:53.377
she's pretty busy the
day before her wedding.

02:53.379 --> 02:56.847
Too busy for her mother?

02:56.849 --> 02:59.467
She used to be
such a devoted daughter.

02:59.469 --> 03:03.721
Now she's just waiting for me
to die so she can get my china.

03:07.977 --> 03:10.561
Thank you again
for picking us up.

03:10.563 --> 03:12.730
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

03:12.732 --> 03:14.532
You know,
our driver to the airport

03:14.534 --> 03:16.867
was also a Indian fella.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.452
Mom...

03:18.454 --> 03:21.822
Oh, so now it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian.

03:21.824 --> 03:26.294
I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.

03:26.296 --> 03:30.214
See? You'll have
to excuse her.

03:30.216 --> 03:32.133
She's just pregnant
and hormonal.

03:32.135 --> 03:35.553
Oh, yeah, congratulations
on baby number two.

03:35.555 --> 03:39.307
Yeah. Whoopie.

03:39.309 --> 03:41.092
Her husband would be here,

03:41.094 --> 03:43.594
but he stayed home
to watch their older son,

03:43.596 --> 03:47.014
so e-everything's fine!

03:47.016 --> 03:48.566
Stop it.

03:48.568 --> 03:51.485
We're separated.

03:51.487 --> 03:54.238
You don't say.

03:55.275 --> 03:57.942
So, you're Sheldon's
big brother.

03:57.944 --> 04:00.027
Uh, yeah.
He got the brains.

04:00.029 --> 04:02.663
I got the bod.

04:02.665 --> 04:04.949
And the face and the hair.

04:04.951 --> 04:06.951
I like your accent.

04:06.953 --> 04:09.370
Sheldon, did you
used to sound like that?

04:09.372 --> 04:11.005
Can you still?

04:14.460 --> 04:17.795
I can. I will not.

04:17.797 --> 04:20.964
Amy, you said something
about my bow tie

04:20.966 --> 04:22.967
that I can't stop
thinking about.

04:22.969 --> 04:24.385
Don't you mean...

04:24.387 --> 04:27.188
"Y'all said
something 'bout my bow tie"?

04:29.142 --> 04:31.192
Go on, say it.

04:31.194 --> 04:33.194
Say it.

04:33.980 --> 04:36.731
Hey, guys, look who I have.

04:36.733 --> 04:38.065
- Oh.
- Hey.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.483
Hey, Shelly.

04:39.485 --> 04:42.787
I'm so glad you made it, Missy.
This is my fiancée, Amy.

04:42.789 --> 04:44.705
Amy, this is my sister.

04:44.707 --> 04:47.208
If I ever need a kidney,
this is where you get it.

04:48.494 --> 04:50.378
- It's so nice to meet you.
- ‭Aw.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.413
I've always wanted a sister.

04:52.415 --> 04:53.831
Really? Why?

04:53.833 --> 04:56.217
I love you, too, Sheldon.

04:56.219 --> 04:58.052
Really? Why?

04:59.172 --> 05:00.504
Where's Mom?

05:00.506 --> 05:03.224
Uh, she wanted to stop by
the hotel and freshen up,

05:03.226 --> 05:06.727
and then call her pastor
to pray for Missy's soul.

05:06.729 --> 05:08.896
Oh, my God.

05:11.684 --> 05:13.768
There's mama's girl.

05:13.770 --> 05:15.519
- Hi, Mom.
- ‭Oh!

05:15.521 --> 05:18.823
Oh, Larry, look at her!

05:18.825 --> 05:22.360
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

05:22.362 --> 05:25.329
He can't believe it.

05:25.331 --> 05:27.415
And neither can I.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.784
Hi, Dad. How you doing?

05:36.759 --> 05:38.843
What the hell is that?

05:38.845 --> 05:40.711
Come on, you know this one.

05:40.713 --> 05:43.264
It's a... dog.

05:43.883 --> 05:45.099
I found him in the backyard.

05:45.101 --> 05:46.884
And don't worry,
I already called the owner.

05:46.886 --> 05:48.719
Good, 'cause
we don't need a dog.

05:48.721 --> 05:51.555
We already have two babies,
you and Stuart.

05:53.559 --> 05:55.693
That's probably him.

05:59.482 --> 06:01.649
Hi.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.203
I'm gonna need a minute.

06:09.876 --> 06:13.077
That's Mark Hamill!

06:20.753 --> 06:23.254
Hello.

06:23.256 --> 06:27.508
Thank you so much
for finding this guy.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.260
Oh, my goodness.

06:29.262 --> 06:31.762
Hey, Bark. How are you, buddy?

06:31.764 --> 06:34.932
Y-Your dog's name is Bark?

06:34.934 --> 06:36.183
Yeah.

06:36.185 --> 06:38.319
Bark Hamill?

06:38.321 --> 06:41.439
Yeah. Well, I let the fans
name him online.

06:41.441 --> 06:42.823
I got lucky, though.

06:42.825 --> 06:44.942
He was almost
Honey Baked Hamill.

06:45.828 --> 06:47.111
Anyway, thanks so much.

06:47.113 --> 06:49.280
I-I want to give you a reward
for finding him.

06:49.282 --> 06:51.665
Oh, no, I
couldn't take your money.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.534
It's just an honor
to meet you.

06:53.536 --> 06:57.171
No. No, please. You don't know
what this dog means to me,

06:57.173 --> 06:59.340
and I thought
he was gone for good.

06:59.342 --> 07:02.376
Please? There must be
something I can do for you.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.794
Anything.

07:03.796 --> 07:07.298
Oh, you're gonna regret
that.

07:09.969 --> 07:11.635
Hey, dude.

07:11.637 --> 07:12.803
Dude?

07:12.805 --> 07:15.222
Yeah, you know,
just want you to know

07:15.224 --> 07:17.141
that I don't think
of you as a woman.

07:17.143 --> 07:20.311
Oh, perfect. I don't
think of you as a man.

07:20.313 --> 07:21.529
Great.

07:21.531 --> 07:24.315
So, as two genderless blobs
of human flesh,

07:24.317 --> 07:25.983
how would you like to go

07:25.985 --> 07:27.735
to Sheldon and Amy's wedding
with me?

07:27.737 --> 07:29.487
Oh, Stuart.

07:29.489 --> 07:32.206
Look, I appreciate that,
but it just might be

07:32.208 --> 07:33.958
a little weird,
considering you're my boss.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.243
Guess who's gonna officiate
Sheldon and Amy's wedding!

07:36.245 --> 07:38.579
Mark Hamill!

07:38.581 --> 07:40.965
Luke Skywalker
is gonna be at the wedding!

07:40.967 --> 07:43.167
You'll need to
buy me a dress.

07:45.338 --> 07:47.004
And did you know
that my Amy

07:47.006 --> 07:49.056
played Amelia Earhart
in the eighth grade?

07:49.058 --> 07:51.342
Amy, you never said you
were in a school play.

07:51.344 --> 07:52.560
Oh, no, no, at home.

07:52.562 --> 07:55.479
I'd never let her
do a school play.

07:55.481 --> 07:59.483
Those kids just take drugs
and have intercourse.

08:02.104 --> 08:05.105
You know, Amy still
does some performing.

08:05.107 --> 08:07.525
She and Sheldon do an
Internet show about flags.

08:07.527 --> 08:09.527
Amy?

08:09.529 --> 08:13.163
V-Videos on the Internet?

08:13.165 --> 08:16.617
You know what men
use those for.

08:16.619 --> 08:18.502
If you're talking about
Fun with Flags,

08:18.504 --> 08:21.255
I use it to go to sleep.

08:21.257 --> 08:23.040
Sheldon,
you're awfully quiet.

08:23.042 --> 08:24.375
Are you okay?

08:24.377 --> 08:26.126
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

08:26.128 --> 08:28.212
I was thinking about
string theory.

08:28.214 --> 08:31.048
But catch me up.
What'd I miss?

08:31.050 --> 08:33.049
Are you seeing
this, Larry?

08:33.052 --> 08:35.719
These are the people I'm
gonna have to live with

08:35.721 --> 08:37.554
after you're dead.

08:42.903 --> 08:45.036
Welcome, Bert.
Don't you look nice.

08:45.038 --> 08:48.456
Yeah. Like a geode,
I clean up good.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.543
Don't you crack a geode open?

08:51.545 --> 08:54.329
It's not a perfect metaphor.

08:55.248 --> 08:57.131
Oh, my God.

08:57.133 --> 08:58.500
- Is that Mark Hamill?
- ‭Yeah.

08:58.502 --> 08:59.467
Oh, my God.

08:59.469 --> 09:02.053
- Is that...
- Bert, go find your seat!

09:03.473 --> 09:04.806
W-What is he doing here?

09:04.808 --> 09:06.090
I found his dog

09:06.092 --> 09:08.142
and guilted him into
officiating the wedding.

09:08.144 --> 09:09.894
Don't tell Sheldon.
It's a surprise.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.896
Wait, I-I thought
Wil was officiating the wedding.

09:11.898 --> 09:13.648
Yeah, so did he.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.266
How did he take the news?

09:15.268 --> 09:16.601
I'll let you know.

09:16.603 --> 09:18.820
Hey, Wil!

09:23.360 --> 09:26.494
Are you having an allergic
reaction to my boutonniere?

09:26.496 --> 09:30.081
No. I'm just so
happy for you.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.950
And for me.

09:31.952 --> 09:33.952
After today, you
are officially--

09:33.954 --> 09:38.456
and, more important,
legally-- Amy's problem.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.959
Don't be silly, Leonard.

09:40.961 --> 09:44.262
I will always be your problem.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.720
Hey, baby.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.222
Hello, Mother.

09:54.224 --> 09:55.807
Leonard, could you
give us a moment?

09:55.809 --> 09:57.525
Oh, of course.

09:58.945 --> 10:01.479
Oh, Shelly.

10:04.085 --> 10:06.835
I wish your dad
could see you now.

10:06.837 --> 10:10.339
Me, too. I miss him.

10:10.341 --> 10:12.808
He would be so
proud of you.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.727
I know that I am.

10:14.729 --> 10:16.178
Thank you.

10:18.015 --> 10:19.848
I mean, for everything.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.817
My whole life.

10:24.021 --> 10:25.521
Oh.

10:27.658 --> 10:29.358
Let me
straighten your tie.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.943
No, no, no, it's all right.

10:30.945 --> 10:33.412
It's supposed to be
a little asymmetrical.

10:33.414 --> 10:37.249
Apparently, a small flaw
somehow improves it.

10:37.251 --> 10:38.867
I can see that.

10:38.869 --> 10:42.788
Sometimes it's the...

10:42.790 --> 10:47.876
imperfect stuff that
makes things perfect.

10:49.930 --> 10:51.797
Excuse me.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.722
Case in point.

11:00.975 --> 11:04.193
So, we finally meet.

11:04.195 --> 11:07.863
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:07.865 --> 11:10.399
I'm Wil Wheaton.

11:10.401 --> 11:12.868
I was supposed
to officiate this wedding.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.321
I was up all night
preparing these notes.

11:15.323 --> 11:19.241
Well, thanks so much.
It's gonna be a great help.

11:23.047 --> 11:24.079
Amy.

11:24.081 --> 11:25.414
Amy.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.466
Amy.

11:27.468 --> 11:29.251
Come in.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.420
There's something
I need to tell you.

11:31.422 --> 11:33.389
Wow, you look amazing!

11:33.391 --> 11:35.391
That's not what I need
to tell you.

11:35.393 --> 11:37.343
But you do!
What's wrong?

11:37.345 --> 11:39.061
Something incredible
just happened.

11:39.063 --> 11:41.146
Remember when you were
telling me about my bow tie

11:41.148 --> 11:43.899
and how a little asymmetry
is good?

11:43.901 --> 11:46.435
- Yeah?
- My equations have been trying

11:46.437 --> 11:48.070
to describe an imperfect world,

11:48.072 --> 11:50.773
and the only way to do that
is to introduce imperfection

11:50.775 --> 11:52.107
into the underlying theory.

11:52.109 --> 11:55.744
So, instead of supersymmetry,

11:55.746 --> 11:58.614
it would be super asymmetry?

11:58.616 --> 12:00.949
Super asymmetry.

12:00.951 --> 12:01.937
That's it!

12:03.411 --> 12:05.454
- Give me your lipstick.
- What?

12:04.935 --> 12:05.937
Just give it to me,
you beautiful thing!

12:05.937 --> 12:07.795
We have work to do!

12:10.177 --> 12:12.378
Hey, uh, the
bride and groom

12:12.380 --> 12:14.546
seem to be running
a little behind.

12:14.548 --> 12:16.131
Do you think
you could stall?

12:16.133 --> 12:18.967
Stall? How?

12:18.969 --> 12:20.803
Hey, everybody!

12:20.805 --> 12:22.721
Uh, it's gonna be a few
more minutes, but while we wait,

12:22.723 --> 12:25.941
does anyone have any
questions about Star Wars?

12:32.817 --> 12:34.700
You got this.

12:37.121 --> 12:39.872
So if I make
slightly asymmetric knots

12:39.874 --> 12:41.373
with sheets in four dimensions,

12:41.375 --> 12:43.492
I can bootstrap
the whole idea

12:43.494 --> 12:46.078
to a large asymmetry
in 11 dimensions.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.464
Maybe even at
the initial moment of creation,

12:48.466 --> 12:50.416
the fundamental forces
lacked symmetry.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.887
Everyone's waiting.
What are you guys doing?

12:54.889 --> 12:56.138
Super asymmetry.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.173
Super asymmetry?
Is that a thing?

12:58.175 --> 13:00.008
We're inventing
it right now.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.511
Don't you think
this can wait until...

13:02.513 --> 13:04.179
Hold on.

13:04.181 --> 13:07.149
This is interesting.

13:08.269 --> 13:10.018
So, yeah, Mr. Mark?

13:11.071 --> 13:13.655
When you were on the,
uh, Wookiee home planet,

13:13.657 --> 13:16.492
how did you even understand
what they were saying?

13:16.494 --> 13:20.078
I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.

13:21.282 --> 13:23.866
Uh, actually, Luke was
on the Wookiee home planet,

13:23.868 --> 13:25.834
Kashyyyk, in the
Holiday Special

13:25.836 --> 13:29.288
when he helped Chewie
get home to his wife.

13:30.124 --> 13:32.207
Chewie had a wife?

13:32.209 --> 13:34.543
Her name's Malla.

13:34.545 --> 13:36.879
Wow, that's impressive.

13:36.881 --> 13:39.381
Yeah.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.633
Hey, uh, I got a question.

13:41.635 --> 13:45.721
Why aren't there tires on
any of those Star Wars vehicles?

13:47.224 --> 13:50.058
I'm sure some of them had tires.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.810
Actually, they don't.

13:51.812 --> 13:55.781
I mean, the HAVw A5 turbo tank
has metal gripping wheels,

13:55.783 --> 13:58.784
but I wouldn't call them tires.

13:58.786 --> 14:02.821
You are so hot.

14:06.377 --> 14:09.578
This is taking too long.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.247
I bet that Sheldon
stood my baby up.

14:12.249 --> 14:13.916
Uh, excuse me.

14:13.918 --> 14:14.883
Where-where are you going?

14:14.885 --> 14:17.085
This whole thing
was a big mistake.

14:17.087 --> 14:18.253
I'm gonna find Amy

14:18.255 --> 14:20.672
and get her out of here.
- ‭Sit down!

14:22.059 --> 14:24.059
Excuse me?

14:24.061 --> 14:25.644
Sheldon loves Amy,

14:25.646 --> 14:27.980
and he would never hurt her
on her wedding day

14:27.982 --> 14:30.098
or any other day, so park it.

14:36.991 --> 14:39.241
Oh, you sit down, too.

14:40.611 --> 14:43.111
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

14:43.113 --> 14:45.113
Say something.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.533
Thank you.

14:50.204 --> 14:51.787
Uh, according
to Google, there are

14:51.789 --> 14:54.122
zero papers
that mention super asymmetry.

14:54.124 --> 14:56.291
This is brand-new.
No one's thought of it.

14:57.795 --> 15:00.095
What are you lunatics doing?!

15:00.097 --> 15:01.930
Sheldon had a breakthrough.

15:01.932 --> 15:04.299
Actually, Amy and I
had a breakthrough.

15:04.301 --> 15:06.552
Oh, science? Shocking!

15:07.721 --> 15:09.888
You don't understand.
This could be really big.

15:09.890 --> 15:11.807
No, Penny's right.

15:11.809 --> 15:15.143
We have our whole lives
to do science together.

15:16.981 --> 15:18.697
Let's get married.

15:18.699 --> 15:19.781
All right.

15:19.783 --> 15:21.149
It's go time!

15:21.151 --> 15:23.318
I am pumped!

15:27.206 --> 15:29.956
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

15:32.711 --> 15:34.377
Leonard.

15:34.379 --> 15:39.216
That's Mark Ha-Ha-Ha...

15:40.686 --> 15:43.720
It's-it's Mark Hami-Ha-Ha...

15:43.722 --> 15:47.224
Yep. Thank Wolowitz.
He set it up.

15:47.226 --> 15:49.359
Thank you.

15:50.812 --> 15:52.979
Congratulations
on your wedding.

15:52.981 --> 15:54.564
Thank you.

15:54.566 --> 15:58.068
When this is over, I have
4,000 things for you to sign.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:16.237 --> 16:18.404
Thank you, Daddy.

16:23.828 --> 16:26.295
I-I thought Wil was marrying us.

16:26.297 --> 16:28.881
Wolowitz got us an upgrade.

16:30.168 --> 16:32.251
Another sci-fi
guy with a beard.

16:32.253 --> 16:35.254
Seems lateral, but okay.

16:35.256 --> 16:36.889
Welcome.

16:36.891 --> 16:38.891
We are gathered here today

16:38.893 --> 16:42.895
in the sight of family,
friends and Almighty God.

16:42.897 --> 16:44.680
That's too religious.

16:44.682 --> 16:47.066
That lady over there
made me say it.

16:47.068 --> 16:51.437
He heard you,
and he can't un-hear you.

16:54.409 --> 16:57.243
We're here
to celebrate the marriage

16:57.245 --> 16:59.245
of Sheldon Lee Cooper...

17:00.582 --> 17:02.114
...and Amy Farrah Fowler.

17:02.116 --> 17:03.783
I had more prepared,

17:03.785 --> 17:06.167
but I'm just gonna skip
to the rings and vows,

17:06.170 --> 17:09.704
since I've been answering
your questions for 45 minutes.

17:09.707 --> 17:13.459
Yeah, he answered 'em.

17:13.461 --> 17:16.628
Amy, you're up.

17:20.718 --> 17:24.887
Sheldon, when I
was a little girl,

17:24.888 --> 17:27.390
I used to dream
about my wedding.

17:27.392 --> 17:29.358
But, eventually,
I stopped,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.945
because I thought that
day would never come.

17:32.947 --> 17:35.698
And then I met you.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.150
From the first moment
in that coffee shop,

17:38.152 --> 17:41.537
I knew that there was
something special between us,

17:41.539 --> 17:43.623
even though I did
work on a study

17:43.625 --> 17:46.158
that disproved love
at first sight.

17:46.160 --> 17:50.212
I loved that study
the moment I read it.

17:50.214 --> 17:51.797
Ironic, huh?

17:53.134 --> 17:56.252
Clearly, it was wrong.

17:56.254 --> 17:59.555
Because I felt
something that day,

17:59.557 --> 18:02.975
and those feelings have only
gotten stronger with time.

18:04.812 --> 18:08.597
I can't imagine loving you
more than I do right now.

18:08.599 --> 18:13.152
But I felt that way yesterday
and the day before yesterday

18:13.154 --> 18:15.855
and the day before that.

18:15.857 --> 18:19.325
Is that growth linear
or accelerating?

18:19.327 --> 18:19.957
Accelerating.

18:19.957 --> 18:21.957
Oh, maybe we could
graph it out.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.751
Save something
for the honeymoon.

18:26.753 --> 18:27.869
Smart.

18:29.923 --> 18:31.756
Sheldon,

18:31.758 --> 18:34.626
I don't know
what the future holds,

18:34.628 --> 18:38.046
but I know that I've never
been happier than I am

18:38.048 --> 18:41.466
in this moment marrying you.

18:43.386 --> 18:47.055
Well, that was
unexpectedly beautiful.

18:49.392 --> 18:51.559
I might need a minute.

18:58.318 --> 19:01.069
Amy...

19:03.039 --> 19:07.659
...I usually know
exactly what to say.

19:07.661 --> 19:11.246
But in this moment...

19:11.248 --> 19:13.915
I have no words.

19:15.969 --> 19:18.887
I guess...

19:20.674 --> 19:23.007
I'm overwhelmed by you.

19:24.477 --> 19:26.427
In a good way.

19:26.429 --> 19:29.731
Not in the elevator
in the Haunted Mansion way.

19:30.684 --> 19:37.105
Even if I can't
tell you now how I feel,

19:37.107 --> 19:42.026
I will spend my life showing you
how much I love you.

19:46.917 --> 19:49.751
Do you...

19:51.838 --> 19:54.038
Do you...

19:55.425 --> 19:59.127
Hey, I'm just saying, I'm here
if you need me to step in.

19:59.129 --> 20:00.878
No, no, no.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.797
I got this.

20:04.301 --> 20:08.636
Amy, do you take Sheldon
for your lawful wedded husband?

20:08.638 --> 20:10.805
I do.

20:10.807 --> 20:13.308
And, Sheldon, same thing.

20:16.479 --> 20:18.563
I do.

20:19.316 --> 20:21.366
Then by the power vested in me

20:21.368 --> 20:24.652
by
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

20:26.156 --> 20:29.073
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.993
You may kiss the bride.
