WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.105
Where is ziva david?

00:06.107 --> 00:08.574
And you are?
Ilan bodnar.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.043
Mossad claims
that bodnar acted alone.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.678
Don't do this.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.346
I'm going to a funeral, tony.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.515
I'm delivering
my father's eulogy.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.750
Homeland's called twice.

00:17.752 --> 00:20.519
Recent intel has him
still in rome.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.021
Tony:
I need to find her.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.255
I think it has something
to do with bodnar.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.058
You are tracking
a cia target.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.260
Bodnar's not dead.
He's alive.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.162
And I'm not gonna stop
until I find him.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.564
I would like your permission to
travel to europe to find bodnar.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.700
He's in rome.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.602
Take dinozzo.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.488
Better late than never.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.656
Stand by.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.162
I was beginning to wonder.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.466
What are you doing here?

01:49.242 --> 01:51.477
(imitating sean connery):
Ah, mcmoneypenny!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.846
Which of these says
"dashing foreign operative"

01:53.848 --> 01:58.784
This isn't exactly a roman
holiday you're going on, tony.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.754
Well, believe me,
I have charted every aqueduct

02:02.756 --> 02:04.857
And escape route that
rome has to offer.

02:04.859 --> 02:07.159
I've see <i>the italian job</i>
<i>twice, both versions.</i>

02:07.161 --> 02:09.294
I'm all business here.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.463
Then stop gloating.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.898
Well, that can't be helped.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.902
I saw the look on your face
when gibbs tabbed me to go.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.770
You did a great job,
though, helping ziva

02:18.772 --> 02:21.573
Track down bodnar...
Behind my back.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.575
Which it's nice to hear
you're finally over.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.178
International espionage is
my middle name.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.613
Stakeout at
the pantheon,

02:27.615 --> 02:29.481
High-speed car chase past
the colosseum,

02:29.483 --> 02:31.817
A little romantic rendezvous
at the trevi fountain.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.318
Gibbs: You can forget
Italy, dinozzo.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.520
Huh, boss? Why?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.822
Come on.
Going to berlin instead.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.290
Berlin?!

02:38.292 --> 02:40.459
Where bodnar is truly headed.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.927
We were wrong about rome?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.228
No, we were right, mcgee.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.230
But by the time tony
and I get there,

02:45.232 --> 02:49.201
Bodnar will have already reached
his final destination.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.669
Berlin? Really?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.337
Yeah. You got a problem
with that?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.439
<i>Nein.</i> I'm just wondering
how we know this

02:54.441 --> 02:58.677
Because only I know how my
father taught bodnar to think,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.445
All his little tricks.

03:00.447 --> 03:03.949
And since bodnar has financial
holdings all over the...

03:03.951 --> 03:04.783
...World?

03:04.785 --> 03:07.219
Universe, really.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.587
What is mossad doing here?

03:11.457 --> 03:12.858
How do you know
they're mossad?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.594
Because I know her.
Why are they here?

03:15.596 --> 03:18.197
Don't know, but I'll find out.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.232
Come on.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.733
Whenever he's ready.
Thank you.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.868
Woman:
Yes, ma'am.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.970
I'll let him know
you're here.

03:24.972 --> 03:29.875
Ziva... I was hoping I would
catch a glimpse of you

03:29.877 --> 03:31.243
In your new home.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.744
What are you doing here, orli?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.546
Well, it's not been made
public yet,

03:34.548 --> 03:40.319
But I have been recently
named rosh ha mossad

03:41.888 --> 03:43.956
Congratulations.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.961
Your father...

03:48.963 --> 03:51.496
Was irreplaceable.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.765
You have my sympathy.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.271
Agent gibbs, please meet
the new director of mossad,

03:59.273 --> 04:01.240
Orli elbaz.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.275
My pleasure, agent gibbs.

04:03.277 --> 04:07.012
Director david always spoke
very highly of you.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.413
And your director vance

04:08.415 --> 04:10.882
Has been kind enough
to grant me

04:10.884 --> 04:17.389
I think it would be beneficial
if you joined us.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.859
Both of you.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.594
(door opens)

04:25.732 --> 04:28.367
Last night a mossad officer,

04:28.369 --> 04:31.003
Amir mantel, was murdered
in a virginia parking lot.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.971
It was a professional hit.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.873
I'm guessing
he wasn't here
on vacation.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.043
He was here, as you might say,
"off the books,"

04:38.045 --> 04:39.745
Director.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.413
As you well know,

04:41.415 --> 04:43.382
Eli david's assassination

04:43.384 --> 04:46.051
Was orchestrated
by one of our own.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.520
Ilan bodnar.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.423
Yes. Here are pictures
of bodnar leaving

04:51.425 --> 04:54.293
The United States,
three months ago.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.927
Yeah, at dulles.
We have the same photos.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.064
If mossad knew bodnar had gone,
why keep an officer in virginia?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.967
She always did ask
the right questions.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.303
You think
bodnar's got help?

05:04.305 --> 05:06.538
Five mossad officers went rogue

05:06.540 --> 05:08.840
In support
of his attempted coup.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.811
Mantel believed this faction
began to assemble here,

05:12.813 --> 05:14.513
Soon after bodnar left.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.416
So mantel got close
to your rogue officers,

05:17.418 --> 05:19.351
They got to him first.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.787
But what's the angle with
them being here in the u.S.?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.689
We're still working on that.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.558
But we do know
that they pose a threat

05:26.560 --> 05:28.427
To anyone searching
for bodnar.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.462
So you want to use us for cover.

05:30.464 --> 05:34.333
Well, I wouldn't put it
quite so crudely.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.868
You sponsor our
investigation,
we supply you

05:36.870 --> 05:38.403
With mossad intel,

05:38.405 --> 05:40.372
And then ncis takes the credit.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.841
Excuse me, director,
since this does not concern me,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.711
Agent dinozzo and I
are ready to leave.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.612
Rome?

05:48.915 --> 05:50.048
Go.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.652
Wait-- cia and interpol

05:53.654 --> 05:55.887
Are already in Italy;
I have a team there also.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.023
I could put you in touch,
if you wish.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.093
That will not be necessary.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.032
Her independence lights up
the room.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.667
You molded her well.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.069
She came that way.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.039
Gentlemen...

06:14.041 --> 06:15.574
From all accounts,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.743
You and eli left off
in a good place.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.011
I hope we can
start there.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.682
This faction poses a threat
to your agents as well.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.451
If we act together,
we are stronger.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.655
So the fbi has
officer mantel's body?

06:30.657 --> 06:33.392
No. You do.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.127
Or you will
momentarily.

06:35.129 --> 06:38.163
I took the liberty.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.439
What do you got, abbs?

06:47.441 --> 06:51.910
These guys are fast.
Talk about "do it and run."

06:51.912 --> 06:53.412
Mossad?

06:53.414 --> 06:56.982
Yeah. There's blood on the seat,
blood on the door.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.884
Ducky got the body?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.786
Not yet.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.855
I don't know if mossad's
budget has been cut...

07:03.857 --> 07:05.524
Or maybe this is their idea

07:05.526 --> 07:07.959
Of a no-frills transport,
but, um...

07:23.075 --> 07:25.210
Ducky is sending jimmy.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.113
There's not much here
beside the guy's name

07:28.115 --> 07:29.481
And his position with mossad.

07:29.483 --> 07:33.185
The mossad cleanup crew gave me
when they dropped him off.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.586
They went to where

07:34.588 --> 07:38.790
To prevent the body
or any other mossad secrets
from being exposed.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.959
Great. So much for preserving
the crime scene.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.230
That mantel was waiting for an
informant when he was murdered.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.465
Personal effects.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.799
He had a cell phone?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.234
No cell phone.
This is his laptop.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.969
I'm sure they did a
"cleanup" on that, too.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.137
I'll give it a going-over.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.005
Abbs...

07:54.007 --> 07:56.007
You may have to get
creative on this one.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.509
That is my specialty.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.178
Hey, um, did tony and
ziva leave yet?

08:00.180 --> 08:03.548
Soon.
They'll call when they land.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.989
Woman (over p.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.925
The lights have been
dimmed for your comfort.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.527
If you would like an additional
blanket at this time,

08:15.529 --> 08:17.829
Please don't hesitate
to press the call button.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.098
A flight attendant will be
passing through the cabin

08:20.100 --> 08:22.234
With headsets,
if you would like to enjoy...

08:22.236 --> 08:24.503
<i>(man, woman arguing in hebrew)</i>

08:24.505 --> 08:26.771
(arguing continues)

08:33.279 --> 08:35.547
(arguing continues)

08:45.691 --> 08:47.158
Ziva...

08:47.160 --> 08:48.860
You thinking of ways

08:48.862 --> 08:50.862
To rough up the
new mossad director?

08:50.864 --> 08:54.099
Orli elbaz is
an opportunist.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.002
She's not even worthy
of roughing up.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.604
Hmm. I'd still
pay to see it.

08:59.606 --> 09:03.208
I was thinking about my father,
actually.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.916
This whole car ride,
to the airport to here,

09:10.918 --> 09:14.052
You have not asked why
we're going to berlin.

09:14.054 --> 09:19.224
I'm officially respecting
your bodnar boundaries.

09:19.226 --> 09:24.296
It was my father
who led me to berlin.

09:24.298 --> 09:27.132
Ghost dreams?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.236
Diamonds.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.939
He had set up a network
of dealers in place,

09:33.941 --> 09:36.608
Just in case he ever
needed to get out fast.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.679
He told me to set up
a network of my own.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.782
Random dealers,
difficult to trace.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.852
And since he had anointed bodnar
as his honorary son...

09:47.854 --> 09:50.355
You thought eli might've given
him the same advice?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.224
Bodnar had multiple accounts
across europe,

09:53.226 --> 09:55.060
Which he recently drained.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.062
Every agency's looking
for the one account

09:57.064 --> 09:59.664
Where he's pooling
his resources.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.701
While you were tracking
diamond dealers.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.235
Wow.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.704
(imitates sean connery):
It's very james bond.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.839
As bodnar's accounts
were closing,

10:07.841 --> 10:09.240
I noticed a clear spike

10:09.242 --> 10:11.343
In dealer transactions
in berlin.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.912
His cash converting
to diamonds.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.147
I believe he plans

10:16.149 --> 10:20.151
To simply pick them up
and disappear.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.353
Okay.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.622
So we're looking at

10:23.624 --> 10:24.656
A diamond chase
through berlin.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.657
No.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.859
No?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.361
When we get there, we wait.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.663
We wait?

10:31.665 --> 10:32.964
Wait for what?

10:36.335 --> 10:39.204
Even neanderthals
had enough respect

10:39.206 --> 10:43.274
To bury their dead in
coffin-like encasements.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.177
It's not like it's your first
dead body in the trunk of a car.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.414
But this man was one of mossad's
own officers, jethro.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.183
Protect their own agency
above all, duck.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.953
What possible security
breach would result

10:54.955 --> 10:57.288
From simply laying
a fellow officer

10:57.290 --> 10:58.690
On a proper stretcher?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.426
It's positively disrespectful

11:01.428 --> 11:04.663
Both to him and to us.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.097
What is that?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.400
Our first bit of intrigue.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.036
A rubber insert from a
communication device.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.203
Some sort of earwig...

11:12.205 --> 11:13.972
Abby:
Hey, I, uh, I pulled the bullet

11:13.974 --> 11:15.306
Out of the seat upholstery,
if you're ready

11:15.308 --> 11:17.842
Yeah, abbs, save me a trip.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.010
Okay, um, it's nine millimeter.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.279
The striations are consistent

11:21.281 --> 11:23.682
With a glock 17--
same type of gun

11:23.684 --> 11:25.417
Recently purchased by their

11:25.419 --> 11:27.719
Rogue officers
off the black-market,

11:27.721 --> 11:29.788
According to mossad intel.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.256
Officer mantel's laptop?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.457
Oh, I've seen a lot
of intricate systems,

11:32.459 --> 11:35.794
But this guy's some
sort of mad genius.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.296
He's got multiple
security codes,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.433
Every file is cross-referenced
with another file.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.069
So unless ducky has
any other goodies for me...

11:44.071 --> 11:45.336
Well, only this.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.139
Overlooked
by mossad's clean-up crew.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.708
Other than that,
not even

11:49.710 --> 11:52.377
A photograph showing the
body in its original state.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.311
Got it, abbs. Thanks.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.082
Tell me how you
really feel, duck.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.249
I may have a chip

11:58.251 --> 12:00.885
On my shoulder, jethro,
but every time

12:00.887 --> 12:04.155
We deal with mossad,
something bad happens.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.958
Please, tell me you're
having second thoughts

12:06.960 --> 12:09.794
About what you've
agreed to here.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.399
Thank you for agreeing

12:14.401 --> 12:16.267
To meet me here, agent gibbs.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.403
In my experience,

12:18.405 --> 12:20.405
The best relationships

12:20.407 --> 12:22.006
Start on neutral ground.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.509
Oh, I think ours
already got going.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.377
That was one hell
of a body transport.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.948
There was
too much at stake.

12:29.950 --> 12:36.521
You have a saying about
desperate times, do you not?

12:39.358 --> 12:40.792
I'm sure...

12:40.794 --> 12:44.129
Ziva has told you
things about me.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.297
That a question?

12:46.299 --> 12:48.032
We are all in this

12:48.034 --> 12:51.536
For the same reason,
agent gibbs.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.772
People we cared about are dead

12:53.774 --> 12:56.174
And those left behind

12:56.176 --> 12:58.109
Are hurting.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.444
You got something for me?

13:01.280 --> 13:04.082
Specifics on
our officer mantel,

13:04.084 --> 13:07.152
And everything he had
on the rogue faction.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.920
Agent gibbs.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.490
Whatever you might
have heard...

13:12.492 --> 13:14.559
I hope...

13:14.561 --> 13:17.896
You will form
your own opinion of me?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.800
I always do.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.941
Any word from david
or dinozzo yet?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.276
Should be landing
at berlin tegel

13:31.278 --> 13:33.144
In a couple of hours.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.480
They're going to do some recon
before heading to their hotel.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.582
Mcgee, got a little
gift for you.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.918
From our new friend at mossad.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.586
Orli elbaz?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.254
Yeah. Interesting lady.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.357
Mcgee: What am I
looking for, boss?

13:46.359 --> 13:47.892
Background on those
rogue officers.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.567
Mcgee: Now, each of these
officers is a mossad veteran

13:55.569 --> 13:56.868
Of at least ten years.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.036
Want me to send out some bolos?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.604
No, that would
just tip them off.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.107
What about the guy they
killed-- officer mantel?

14:03.109 --> 14:05.176
What was his home base?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.947
Last known location is
a hotel in downtown baltimore.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.282
Good place to start.
Yeah.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.484
Let's go.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.458
Manager says mantel was pre-paid
for another two weeks.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.027
Kept to himself and requested
no maid service.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.128
His room was spotless.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.997
Well, mossad's clean-up crew.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.498
Yeah, well, they do
get around, mcgee.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.535
Manager recognize
the rogue officers?

14:30.537 --> 14:34.272
Uh, thought she said
she'd seen this guy.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.140
Tomer gottleib-- claims
that he may have

14:36.142 --> 14:38.576
Paid a visit to mantel,
but not positive.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.511
So what next?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.380
Well, next we stand here

14:42.382 --> 14:44.349
And pretend like we're talking

14:44.351 --> 14:46.317
Until whoever is
watching us makes their move.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.419
(laughs)

14:48.421 --> 14:50.555
Boss, I won't look, but where?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.624
Your 5:00, mcgee.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.659
Green suv.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.195
(exaggerated yawn)

14:57.197 --> 14:58.496
Ah, geez, mcgee.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.466
You didn't keep it
stealthy enough-- hey!

15:01.468 --> 15:03.601
Ncis, stop!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.237
(tires screeching)

15:17.650 --> 15:20.251
You cannot tell me
that you prefer

15:20.253 --> 15:22.253
This sad decor
to the garden.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.955
We were being watched.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.590
You and I?

15:25.592 --> 15:26.591
No.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.260
Us, at mantel's place.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.995
Your clean-up crew
happen to see

15:30.997 --> 15:33.164
A green suv while
they were there?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.066
Not that I know of.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.167
You believe it was one

15:36.169 --> 15:38.136
Of bodnar's faction?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.004
The suv had dummy plates.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.275
What are you after, director?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.277
(scoffs)
what am I "after"?

15:46.279 --> 15:49.280
Because the files you gave
us say you don't know.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.249
Why are those
rogue agents here?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.651
We can only speculate

15:53.653 --> 15:56.521
That they may be trying
to sell secrets to our enemies.

15:56.523 --> 16:00.391
Secrets that can hurt
both our nations.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.327
Sure seems like you may

16:02.329 --> 16:04.595
Be hanging us out
there as targets.

16:04.597 --> 16:08.533
Agent gibbs, I will stand my
officers in front of you,

16:08.535 --> 16:11.202
If that is what it takes
to earn your trust.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.271
You stay away from
my crime scene.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.739
I have an organization
to protect.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.075
I'm not gonna tell you again.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.748
Morning, tom.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.151
I was hoping maybe you'd
bring the coffee this time.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.320
My ulcer's kicking up enough.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.725
When the hell were
you gonna tell me, leon?

16:33.727 --> 16:37.195
Working with mossad?
Again?

16:37.197 --> 16:40.565
I wasn't aware that I needed
homeland's permission.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.766
I told you...

16:41.768 --> 16:44.302
We're already working
with cia on bodnar.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.205
Don't need other
agencies interfering.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.141
Well, maybe this isn't about
bodnar, not directly.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.110
I know about the dead
mossad officer.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.480
And you know that's
fbi jurisdiction.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.682
It's a simple joint
investigation, tom,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.417
With everything above board.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.619
"above board"?
Mm-hmm.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.221
Like berlin?

17:05.424 --> 17:08.126
Bodnar's not there,
he's in rome.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.728
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.598
Nobody knows anything for sure.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.199
Look, I know how
personal catching

17:15.201 --> 17:16.801
Bodnar is to you and david.

17:16.803 --> 17:20.038
You let me worry about that.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.106
I'm your friend, leon.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.443
I'd hate to see this
blow up in your face.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.689
Hallo.
<i>Guten tag.</i>

17:38.691 --> 17:40.425
(woman laughing
with children)

17:53.105 --> 17:55.173
<i>Abba?</i>

18:07.853 --> 18:10.088
Are you...

18:10.090 --> 18:12.423
Going away for
work again?

18:19.364 --> 18:23.234
(phone ringing)

18:26.105 --> 18:28.106
David.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.174
(speaking hebrew)

18:34.179 --> 18:36.314
<i>Achtung,</i> baby.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.683
I just picked up the
perfect souvenir for mcgee.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.717
Check this out.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.854
What, what? (laughs)

18:42.856 --> 18:44.589
Hey, there's a great
place around the corner.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.756
Want to grab a schnitzel?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.391
Tourist time is over.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.593
Heard from your contact?

18:48.595 --> 18:50.661
Yes; he has something.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.567
Well, I got to admit, ziva,

18:56.569 --> 18:59.470
Berlin has better
scenery than I expected.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.739
Something tells me you
and my old friend

19:01.741 --> 19:03.207
Will get along just fine.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.676
Well, I like all
your old friends.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.211
Especially shmeil.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.312
He's like a long-lost uncle.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.281
I could always
use another uncle.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.916
Ziva!

19:11.918 --> 19:13.251
Adam.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.823
There you are.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.324
(ziva laughing, kissing)

19:20.326 --> 19:21.526
Thank you for coming.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.927
What else could I do?

19:22.929 --> 19:24.428
You would only hunt
me down and hurt me.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.297
(laughs)

19:26.299 --> 19:27.632
Ziva:
Adam eshel.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.234
I want you to meet
special agent tony dinozzo.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.636
So nice to finally
meet you, tony.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.171
Ziva's told me
many great things.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.173
Same here.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.774
Did you get the e-mail I sent?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.911
No, but I have my laptop.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.513
Ah.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.891
Ah, here we go.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.459
Thank you very much.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.361
(waitress speaking german)
danke shoen.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.630
You're not going
to drink that-- are you?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.965
When in rome.

20:00.967 --> 20:01.966
Absolutely.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.701
Drink up.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.204
The better to blend in
like a common tourist.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.238
(laughs)

20:07.240 --> 20:07.972
(laughs)

20:07.974 --> 20:11.576
So are you originally
from tel aviv?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.544
Just outside-- savyon.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
Oh, I've seen that on a map.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.381
You play any sports
growing up?

20:17.383 --> 20:18.983
Some basketball.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.318
(laughing):
Ah, oh!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.252
Basketball.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.320
Me, too.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.288
Maybe, uh, you and I
find a court,

20:24.290 --> 20:25.356
Play a little one on one?

20:25.358 --> 20:27.992
You can ask adam
out on a date later.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.393
Right now I need to
know what these pictures

20:29.395 --> 20:30.494
Are all about, please.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.697
(grunts) okay.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.366
As you know, I tracked bodnar's
money to a safety deposit box

20:35.368 --> 20:37.735
Here at the osterhagen bank.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.303
That is not bodnar.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.705
No, that is a
hired courier,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.440
Known by my sources
only as k.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.542
A letter and a job title.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.776
Great.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.411
It's more than you had
when you sat down,

20:47.413 --> 20:49.747
Ziva:
Go on.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.583
K used bodnar's identification
to empty the box of its cash.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.685
Which he converted to diamonds.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.287
Chatter says he's planning
a handoff tonight

20:56.289 --> 20:57.355
At his place of employment.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.589
Where's that?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.324
My sources do not yet know.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.427
But the handoff is to bodnar?

21:03.429 --> 21:06.264
Yes, that is
my expectation.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.299
So, uh, your sources
have any idea

21:08.301 --> 21:11.502
Enough diamonds to fill
half your beer stein.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.539
(phone ringing)

21:15.541 --> 21:18.009
I have seen
this user I.D. Before.

21:18.011 --> 21:18.876
Give me some room.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.444
Call mcgee, get a trace.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.848
Yes, ma'am.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.951
(sighs)

21:32.291 --> 21:34.058
There you are, ziva.

21:34.060 --> 21:37.061
Hello, ilan.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.029
You alone?

21:38.031 --> 21:39.730
As alone as anyone can be

21:39.732 --> 21:41.932
In the streets
of my nation's capitol.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.538
<i>Guten morgen,</i> tony.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.940
Bodnar's on ziva's laptop.
Trace it like the wind.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.410
All right.
Tell her to keep him talking.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.313
I know you blame me
for your father's death, ziva.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.448
Is there anyone else to blame?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.083
Nothing is black and white.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.085
You don't know the entire story.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.453
Then, please, enlighten me.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.788
Mcgee, you got anything?

22:04.756 --> 22:06.457
I got him, but he's good.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.326
Signal's bouncing
all over the globe.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.594
You know explanations
will require time

22:10.596 --> 22:12.063
That we do not have.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.564
We can make the time.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.734
Perhaps, in a few days.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.003
Nothing will make me happier.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.839
For now, take my word for it.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.575
Nothing is entirely as it seems.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.478
I wish things
were different, ziva.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.347
Thanks to you,
they're not, ilan.

22:29.349 --> 22:33.117
Please forgive me and walk away.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.686
Vendettas lead to nothing
but heartache.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.955
The only heartache I have, ilan,

22:37.957 --> 22:40.424
Is from ever trusting
you at all.

22:40.426 --> 22:44.495
Well, then I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.097
Good-bye, ziva.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.498
No, wait, wait, wait, ilan.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.133
Damn it.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.568
Tony.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.635
Mcgee?

22:52.771 --> 22:54.138
Transmission ended.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.707
(sighs) no dice.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.576
Mcgee: Wait, there's one
device still turned on.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.744
It could be bodnar's.

22:59.746 --> 23:00.945
Where's it coming from?

23:02.514 --> 23:04.482
I see your laptop
and I don't believe it.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.616
What-what is it, mcgee?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.618
Ziva, he's there.
He's real close.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.552
Where?

23:11.423 --> 23:13.090
Looks like a subway station.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.526
The u-bahn-- there's an
entrance around the corner.

23:20.799 --> 23:23.000
(panting):
Oh, man, where's waldo?

23:25.804 --> 23:29.140
I don't suppose waving
our guns and badges is
gonna do any good.

23:30.709 --> 23:31.809
I see him.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.513
(woman screams)
<i>bitte schwer zuganglich.</i>

23:38.583 --> 23:39.583
Bodnar.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.787
No, damn it.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.455
Mcgee, anything?

23:44.457 --> 23:48.426
Tony, bodnar's
on the move. Fast.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.761
(sighs) and I
just lost his signal.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.697
On a train. Signal's gone.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.001
God, so is he.

24:05.577 --> 24:08.813
Well, looks like
their laptop's asleep,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.549
But I can take care of that.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.685
(tony groaning)

24:14.687 --> 24:15.986
(groaning):
Oh, god...

24:15.988 --> 24:17.121
Really, tony?

24:17.123 --> 24:21.058
Oh, hey there, mcgee.
Hi, boss.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.661
Uh, just... Sorry,
I thought we weren't
doing this till later.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.095
Yeah...
Yeah, I got that.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.730
I was just getting ready

24:26.732 --> 24:28.165
To recharge my batteries
for tonight.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.000
Can't take a nap
with your pants on.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.168
We are ready.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.870
Let's go.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.106
According to my contact,
this man is a hired courier

24:36.108 --> 24:38.542
Known as "k."

24:38.544 --> 24:40.811
Word is, special
k'll be handing off
the diamonds tonight.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.746
We I.D. Him, should lead
us straight to bodnar.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.082
Mcgee.
Running facial recognition.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.651
We sure about your contact?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.153
Well, there's an awful lot

24:49.155 --> 24:50.254
He didn't know, boss.

24:50.256 --> 24:53.524
Uh, my contact
is quite reliable, gibbs.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.159
And mcgee's computer trace
confirmed that bodnar

24:55.161 --> 24:56.260
Is in berlin.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.828
We know the hand off location?

24:57.830 --> 25:04.034
Reliable contact
couldn't be any more
specific than that.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.236
Boss, I got a hit here.

25:05.238 --> 25:09.073
Looks like the k
is short for edward kraus.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.207
What's his connection to bodnar?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.643
Drug trafficking.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.044
Ten years ago,
bodnar's testimony

25:14.046 --> 25:15.613
Kept kraus out of prison.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.681
Easy to trust a guy
who owes you.

25:17.683 --> 25:21.785
Kraus's paychecks come from
a nightclub called gasthaus.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.287
That should
be the handoff location.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.922
Tony:
That's fancy.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.257
Better unpack my suit.

25:26.259 --> 25:27.525
Anything else on your end?

25:27.527 --> 25:29.827
Just the new mossad director.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.762
Orli has
a long- standing history

25:31.764 --> 25:33.163
Of not playing by the rules.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.600
I would not
trust her unless she earns it.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.202
Get some rest.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.037
Let's be careful out there.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.973
Mcgee.
We will.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.110
Tony:
I'm just gonna catch 40.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.178
And then get up,
grab a bite, brush my teeth,

25:48.180 --> 25:50.881
Take a shower
and then get dressed and go.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.151
Naps tend to work better
when you lay down.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.886
And stop talking.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.221
Okay.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.756
No, no,
you stay there.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.091
I'll take the pull-out.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.894
Oh, thank you.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.864
Are you seriously hanging
up my clothes, sweet cheeks?

26:06.866 --> 26:08.098
(laughs)

26:08.100 --> 26:09.166
Oh, that's very funny.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.701
What?

26:10.703 --> 26:13.137
You do not think I remember
when you called me that.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.138
Mon petit pois.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.740
(laughs): Look at you.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.209
Oh, this proves it.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.111
I always knew you were the type.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.781
I'm many things, tony.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.917
A type... Not one of them.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.919
(sighs): Oh, yes you are.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.322
You are the type
who likes to hang up

26:31.324 --> 26:34.291
Her man's clothes for tonight.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.826
(laughs)

26:35.828 --> 26:38.762
When I have a man

26:38.764 --> 26:42.933
The favors I offer
have little to do with clothes.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.269
Well, that's good to know.

26:45.271 --> 26:49.206
Come on. You should
get some sleep, too.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.117
I cannot sleep.

27:04.155 --> 27:06.256
(quiet, brief grunt)

27:08.226 --> 27:13.163
Last night, on the plane, you
were thinking about your dad.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.732
What was it?

27:16.301 --> 27:19.303
A lot of things.

27:24.342 --> 27:26.377
We'll get bodnar tonight.

27:27.345 --> 27:31.415
I know.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.155
<i>Willkommen,</i> gibbs.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.291
Abbs, what is all this?

27:41.293 --> 27:43.761
This... Is berlin.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.962
I decided that,
instead of worrying

27:44.964 --> 27:46.330
About tony and ziva,
that I would just

27:46.332 --> 27:48.065
Sort of be
with them in spirit.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.266
And I'm making <i>spatzle.</i>

27:49.268 --> 27:52.236
No, I'd rather hear
why you called.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.139
Um, well, you know
this little rubber thingie

27:55.141 --> 27:56.940
That ducky pulled
out of mantel's ear?

27:56.942 --> 27:58.142
Yeah.
Piece of the earwig.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.077
What about it?
Well, I did
some digging,

28:00.079 --> 28:02.813
That mossad upgraded
to a new communications

28:02.815 --> 28:04.748
System about a month ago.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.384
This rubber piece is detached
from an old earwig.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.954
The new model is
one molded insert.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.290
And the two aren't
the least bit compatible.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.827
So, for a guy chasing mossad's
number-one enemy...

28:16.829 --> 28:18.295
Well, he'd be hardly equipped.
I mean, how could mossad

28:18.297 --> 28:20.330
Even talk to him
if he was using the old system?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.768
Thanks, abbs.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.304
Wait, wait, wait, I want you to
check out mantel's laptop.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.441
Remember how I said he was some
sort of mad computer genius?

28:30.443 --> 28:32.309
He's not
a genius at all.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.212
All of these codes
and intersecting files

28:35.214 --> 28:38.048
Were planted there as
a big time-waster.

28:38.050 --> 28:41.051
The whole thing is designed
just to send someone like me

28:41.053 --> 28:42.486
(phone keypad beeping)
running around
in circles.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.887
(line rings)

28:43.889 --> 28:45.723
(over phone): Vance.
Hey, leon.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.462
We're done playing, gibbs.

28:51.464 --> 28:54.164
Director, I still don't
think this is such a good idea.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.733
Just let me know when you're in.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.167
In where?

28:57.169 --> 28:59.303
Mossad's database.

29:03.274 --> 29:05.175
You're hacking them?

29:05.177 --> 29:06.777
Technically, I am.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.245
On my orders,
mcgee.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.847
I'll take
full responsibility.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.448
Gibbs, you don't have
to be a part of this,

29:11.450 --> 29:12.483
If you'd rather not.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.084
What do you think?

29:16.488 --> 29:18.322
Okay. Think I'm in.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.858
Get everything they got
on officer mantel;

29:20.860 --> 29:22.326
Files and reports.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.461
Well, there's
no reports, but...

29:24.463 --> 29:26.430
They've red-flagged mantel.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.166
Labeled him as a rogue officer.

29:29.168 --> 29:33.437
Orli said he was killed
while investigating bognar.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.074
She lied.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.214
These rooms keep getting worse.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.985
And more crowded.

29:50.922 --> 29:53.323
There something
you feel like talking about?

29:53.325 --> 29:56.193
If you're not more specific,
we could find ourselves

29:56.195 --> 29:58.929
Entrenched in a debate
about chaucer.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.466
Mantel was not killed
by some faction.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.801
Mossad did it.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.069
Who is telling you this?

30:06.071 --> 30:07.571
You are.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.540
Mantel was rogue.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.376
It's in your own
damn system, orli.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.111
There never was a faction.

30:15.246 --> 30:19.449
Mossad database lists
all five as active officers.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.552
The only one working
with bodnar was mantel.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.288
You located mantel,
you killed him.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.223
Game ends now.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.427
You put me in a mirrored room

30:30.429 --> 30:32.296
And I'm the one playing games?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.364
You had an officer
stay on my people

30:34.366 --> 30:36.300
Making sure that
we were on a case

30:36.302 --> 30:37.467
That didn't exist.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.237
I want to know
why, director.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.374
Agent gibbs,
may I have

30:44.376 --> 30:46.143
A moment
with the director?

30:46.145 --> 30:47.911
He stays.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.850
I just wanted to say...

30:54.485 --> 30:56.186
That night, in your home,

30:56.188 --> 31:01.325
Mossad was not alone
in suffering a terrible loss.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.295
Oh, leon, I'm so sorry
about jackie.

31:06.264 --> 31:11.301
Director elbaz,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.437
My wife is
not a tactic.

31:17.175 --> 31:20.043
(clears throat)
I'd like to see the letter

31:20.045 --> 31:22.346
From your attorney general
giving you permission

31:22.348 --> 31:24.948
To infiltrate mossad's database.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.222
I believe we're finished.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.291
I don't think so!

31:36.027 --> 31:38.295
I've got two agents abroad
working without a playbook.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.298
Nobody's going anywhere
until we get some answers.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.176
(sighs)

31:58.316 --> 32:01.285
My god, this place
looks good on me.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.319
Hm.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.487
Thank you.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.289
Anything?

32:05.291 --> 32:07.658
Perhaps he works
in the back.

32:07.660 --> 32:10.327
Well, a couple more minutes,
then I'll

32:10.329 --> 32:12.596
Give myself the tour.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.299
Let me guess.
Shaken, not stirred?

32:15.301 --> 32:18.235
Since when do you
know your bond?

32:18.237 --> 32:21.371
I do not know bond,
but I know you.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.044
To berlin.

32:28.313 --> 32:29.680
Ziva:
12:00.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.082
(imitating connery):
Good evening, mr. Kraus.

32:32.084 --> 32:35.585
It is likely he already
has the diamonds on him.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.262
I lost him, tony.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.297
Dance with me.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.166
What?

32:52.070 --> 32:54.104
They're playing our song,
sweet cheeks.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.172
(laughs)

32:57.409 --> 33:00.644
...To the far side
of the floor.

33:00.646 --> 33:04.648
You realize you're going to
have to be the girl, right?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.216
Then you lead.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.455
You have him? I got nothin'.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.059
(whispering):
Got him.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.060
Headed for the bar.

33:17.062 --> 33:19.329
How about bodnar?
Anything?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.064
Negative.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.268
Damn it, I think
he made me.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.269
I'm not sure.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.338
All right. Stay with me.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.041
I got him.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.709
Act like you're
just with me.

33:32.711 --> 33:37.481
(slow, romantic jazz
ballad playing)

33:47.258 --> 33:50.494
(slow music playing)

33:52.630 --> 33:54.698
How long will you be gone?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.568
This time is different.

34:00.438 --> 34:03.173
I do not know
when I will be back.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.711
Oh, my ziva...

34:07.713 --> 34:09.780
One day, you will
dance with a man

34:09.782 --> 34:11.815
Who deserves your love.

34:17.588 --> 34:22.426
Female vocalist:
♪ in this world...

34:22.428 --> 34:25.829
♪

34:25.831 --> 34:27.664
It's bodnar. Go.

34:35.339 --> 34:36.773
Ilan.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.643
Turn around, slowly.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.451
Yaniv?!

34:47.453 --> 34:48.518
Who the hell's yaniv?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.753
Ilan's brother.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.488
You shoot me now, ziva,

34:51.490 --> 34:54.091
I will tell you nothing.

35:10.508 --> 35:12.642
Having fun?

35:12.644 --> 35:16.379
Sadly, meditation
is the only art form

35:16.381 --> 35:17.714
At which I excel.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.317
And yes.
I do enjoy it.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.620
I just got word.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.155
Bodnar was arrested.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.389
In berlin.

35:28.826 --> 35:31.528
I thought you'd be
jumping up and down.

35:31.530 --> 35:35.699
I would like my phone,
please, to confirm.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.634
You don't believe me?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.871
I believe you consider yourself
far too honorable

35:40.873 --> 35:43.740
To lie to me, but perhaps
you've been misinformed.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.409
Because you thought
that bodnar was in rome?

35:48.779 --> 35:51.515
You thought bodnar
was here.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.584
You brought us this dummy case

35:54.586 --> 35:55.685
So we'd give you permission

35:55.687 --> 35:56.920
To be on u.S. Soil.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.388
That is ridiculous.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.458
You saw the photos
of him leaving the country.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.593
You thought he came back.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.463
You had to come here
to protect mossad's secrets.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.832
To kill bodnar
before he was arrested.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.401
Of course I want him dead.
Don't you?

36:11.403 --> 36:14.471
Giving your people
more time to get him.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.373
My phone, agent gibbs.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.874
Say it. It's over.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.509
We are wasting time.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.211
You thought bodnar
was here.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.946
Yes! I thought he was here.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.714
I thought he never left.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.951
Now, I would like
to confirm your intel.

36:28.786 --> 36:29.853
You're right.

36:31.455 --> 36:33.590
Would not lie to you
about bodnar.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.262
It was yaniv.

36:40.264 --> 36:44.267
Yaniv bodnar
was arrested in berlin.

36:44.269 --> 36:47.537
Tell your people to send over
everything you got.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.347
Tony.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.449
Bathroom's open.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.518
(clears throat)

37:10.795 --> 37:14.297
Tell me, yaniv...

37:14.299 --> 37:17.300
What did ilan have
to do to win you back?

37:20.571 --> 37:22.639
(exhales)

37:22.641 --> 37:23.873
You're not mossad.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.009
This is not you.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.612
Look, I know you were
supposed to take

37:28.614 --> 37:30.447
The diamonds
to your brother.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.349
I also know that ilan

37:32.351 --> 37:35.385
Is still in
the United States.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.921
Yes...
(exhales)

37:37.923 --> 37:39.589
We are close.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.724
And we will get him,

37:40.726 --> 37:42.792
With or without you.

37:44.962 --> 37:48.265
Do not throw away
your life, too.

37:49.033 --> 37:51.001
Come on, yaniv.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.803
Let us help each other.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.706
Where were you going
to meet ilan?

38:00.711 --> 38:04.514
You would do anything
for your family...

38:04.516 --> 38:06.883
Even if they had done wrong,

38:06.885 --> 38:08.685
Would you not?

38:09.654 --> 38:12.289
You wrote him off.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.725
You had not spoken
in years.

38:15.727 --> 38:19.296
I do not understand
this loyalty.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.065
It never leaves us,

38:22.067 --> 38:24.334
Does it, ziva?

38:28.072 --> 38:31.374
Gibbs;
ncis, cia, homeland.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.877
All working from the same
airport surveillance photos.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.078
Yeah.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.913
Bodnar leaving dulles for rome.

38:36.915 --> 38:37.914
Yeah.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.582
The thing is...

38:39.584 --> 38:41.418
There were some photos
we didn't see.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.590
Brothers...

38:47.592 --> 38:49.826
Switching clothes in the head.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.394
Elbaz:
Using an alias,

38:51.396 --> 38:53.830
Yaniv boarded
the plane to rome,

38:53.832 --> 38:55.498
And bodnar stayed
in the u.S.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.701
My officer attempted
to follow bodnar,

38:57.703 --> 38:59.569
But lost him.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.838
You know how much manpower
we wasted

39:01.840 --> 39:03.073
Looking for bodnar in rome?

39:03.075 --> 39:04.708
That wasn't
our intention.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.576
Then what the hell was it?

39:06.578 --> 39:09.412
Let everyone take
the wild goose chase,

39:09.414 --> 39:10.947
And hope that bodnar

39:10.949 --> 39:12.449
Let his guard down
in the United States.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.351
And did he?

39:14.353 --> 39:16.953
After all this, are you
any closer to catching him?

39:16.955 --> 39:20.090
No, I cannot say
that we are.

39:20.092 --> 39:22.125
Morrow:
So...

39:22.127 --> 39:24.394
What are we proposing, here?

39:25.062 --> 39:27.364
Well, with international
tensions

39:27.366 --> 39:28.898
Being so high on this...

39:30.968 --> 39:33.436
I'm proposing that we
look the other way.

39:34.805 --> 39:36.439
You can't be serious.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.807
Vance:
I am, tom.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.142
We come down hard
on mossad now,

39:39.144 --> 39:40.143
Then what happens?

39:40.145 --> 39:43.813
Wasted manpower if bodnar
gets away after all this.

39:46.751 --> 39:47.751
But understand:

39:47.753 --> 39:50.754
This one pass...

39:50.756 --> 39:53.056
Is the last one mossad
ever gets from me.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.657
That makes two of us.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.627
Three.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.431
I understand.

40:01.433 --> 40:05.168
A transport leaves dover
for israel in three hours.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.705
An escort will see to it that
you and your people are on it.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.513
Ziva:
<i>Very well.</i>

40:16.515 --> 40:18.014
Thank you.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.049
Transport is complete.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.818
Federal marshals
are questioning yaniv.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.454
Mm. Barrel of laughs,
that guy.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.522
(chuckles)

40:34.565 --> 40:35.565
Looks good on you.

40:35.567 --> 40:38.001
It's funny...

40:38.003 --> 40:40.804
The things we decide
are worth something.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.906
Well, hey,
thanks to you,

40:42.908 --> 40:44.174
He's got no funding.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.875
Makes it kind of hard
to disappear broke.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.845
I should have known
that orli was here for bodnar.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.914
I'm sure she wants him dead
as badly as I do.

40:51.882 --> 40:54.083
I doubt that.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.485
It's her job,

40:55.487 --> 40:56.486
But he was your father.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.591
It's not just her job.

41:04.995 --> 41:08.131
Orli was the reason my parents
split up.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.467
I did not say anything,

41:10.469 --> 41:12.001
Because I did not
think it mattered.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.237
Did it?

41:14.239 --> 41:17.807
She was a young officer.

41:17.809 --> 41:22.212
And my father was...

41:22.214 --> 41:24.948
Weak.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.016
And then it just ended.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.220
And I always
just told myself

41:30.222 --> 41:33.156
That that was just
another rule she broke

41:33.158 --> 41:35.492
In order to advance
her career.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.195
But now I think...

41:41.499 --> 41:44.234
...She was here for the same
reason I went to berlin.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.539
Because maybe she loved
my father.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.283
You know, I keep thinking
if it was not for orli,

42:00.285 --> 42:02.218
Things would have
been different.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.623
I would be a different person.

42:08.092 --> 42:11.160
Then I should catch her
before she leaves.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.535
You know.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.237
And thank her.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.312
Tony...

42:30.314 --> 42:32.715
Yeah-- ziva!

42:34.285 --> 42:36.553
(tires screeching)

42:37.288 --> 42:38.988
(car horn blaring)

42:41.659 --> 42:43.726
(horn continues blaring)
