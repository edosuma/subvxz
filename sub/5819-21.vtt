WEBVTT

00:01.597 --> 00:03.048
DAVINA: Previously on "The Originals"...

00:03.078 --> 00:05.400
FREYA: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.430 --> 00:06.679
you will all fall,

00:06.681 --> 00:07.886
one by friend,

00:07.916 --> 00:10.474
one by foe and one... by family.

00:10.504 --> 00:12.001
This transformed me

00:12.003 --> 00:13.441
into something new.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.100
My bite is lethal.

00:15.539 --> 00:16.472
Don't be afraid.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.724
You will find peace.

00:18.726 --> 00:21.417
- The Ancestors want you to kill me?
- Eventually, I'll give in.

00:21.948 --> 00:23.146
MARCEL: Witch spirits can be brought

00:23.148 --> 00:24.618
back from the dead, so that is

00:24.648 --> 00:26.365
exactly what we are going to do.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.817
To make Lucien killable, I will have

00:27.819 --> 00:29.318
to break the circle
that protects Davina.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.903
Freya, that will destroy her.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.616
- What happened?
- The Ancestors got to her first.

00:32.647 --> 00:33.990
KLAUS: Where the bloody hell is she?!

00:33.992 --> 00:35.125
(Davina screaming)

00:35.155 --> 00:36.489
That's it, man. She's gone.

00:36.519 --> 00:37.527
What happened to Davina,

00:37.557 --> 00:38.783
cannot go unanswered.

00:38.813 --> 00:40.063
Same stuff that made Lucien.

00:40.065 --> 00:41.936
I extracted it from Aurora's heart.

00:41.966 --> 00:44.467
New Orleans is our home, Marcel,

00:44.469 --> 00:46.853
and it's time we took it back.

00:47.978 --> 00:52.268
(Slow, mournful jazz playing)

00:58.842 --> 01:01.378
VINCENT: Say not in grief,

01:01.408 --> 01:03.619
that she is no more,

01:04.171 --> 01:06.622
but be thankful that she ever was...

01:08.175 --> 01:10.682
and though she was taken far too soon,

01:10.712 --> 01:11.804
may her enduring light

01:11.834 --> 01:14.964
show us a way through this darkness.

01:14.966 --> 01:17.300
(Mournful jazz continues)

01:19.954 --> 01:22.621
Let us mourn...

01:22.623 --> 01:25.508
because we cannot move on until we do...

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.252 --> 01:37.002
and though the pain may at times

01:37.004 --> 01:39.037
seem like more than we can bear...

01:43.244 --> 01:45.700
make no mistake...

01:45.730 --> 01:48.147
we will move on.

01:51.887 --> 01:54.236
(Mournful jazz continues)

02:08.174 --> 02:10.619
Yeah, even now the
words of Ecclesiasticus

02:10.621 --> 02:11.787
are ringing in my ears.

02:11.789 --> 02:14.507
They're saying, "Vengeance,

02:14.509 --> 02:16.397
"as a lion,

02:16.427 --> 02:18.427
shall lie in wait for them."

02:30.408 --> 02:32.441
A while ago...

02:32.443 --> 02:34.026
(Chuckles)

02:34.028 --> 02:35.861
forever ago,

02:35.863 --> 02:39.949
I told Davina a story
about my first boyfriend...

02:39.951 --> 02:43.619
but what I didn't tell her was that...

02:43.621 --> 02:46.005
I had never shared that
story with anyone else.

02:48.482 --> 02:52.511
She was like a sister
and a best friend...

02:54.465 --> 02:55.965
and I loved her.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.219
I wish th...

03:02.140 --> 03:03.439
Uh...

03:09.038 --> 03:10.062
(Sniffles)

03:12.217 --> 03:14.483
(Voice breaking): I'm sorry.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.369
I can't.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.872
(Sniffling)

03:29.951 --> 03:31.901
Words aren't any good.

03:32.950 --> 03:35.988
The Mikaelsons need to answer for this.

03:35.990 --> 03:38.389
I'm gonna make them answer.

03:41.523 --> 03:43.462
(Quietly): I promise.

03:54.559 --> 03:57.919
(Upbeat Dixieland jazz plays)

04:04.635 --> 04:05.934
Okay, we can't run out of

04:05.936 --> 04:07.219
whiskey at an Irish wake.

04:07.221 --> 04:09.888
It's, like, the one rule, okay?

04:11.726 --> 04:13.566
Whiskey is important.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.978
Whiskey's important.

04:19.033 --> 04:21.199
I'm certain Camille
would have appreciated

04:21.228 --> 04:22.818
all of this.

04:23.345 --> 04:25.320
I hope so.

04:28.576 --> 04:30.793
How is he?

04:47.428 --> 04:49.395
Excuse me, don't I know you?

04:52.433 --> 04:54.683
Sorry.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.435
Uh, you just look so familiar.

04:57.488 --> 05:00.072
I have one of those faces.

05:01.311 --> 05:02.491
Did you know her well?

05:02.493 --> 05:04.009
I did.

05:04.378 --> 05:06.378
She was, uh...

05:06.380 --> 05:08.297
a very special girl.

05:08.299 --> 05:12.601
There's no polite summation
that will do her justice...

05:18.569 --> 05:23.445
but you're brave to try, and
she would've admired that.

05:24.406 --> 05:26.448
I haven't read anywhere how she died.

05:26.796 --> 05:28.617
Do you know?

05:29.694 --> 05:31.487
An accident.

05:35.729 --> 05:38.544
Are you here in an
official capacity, Officer?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.667
No.

05:40.976 --> 05:43.649
Just came to pay my respects.

06:04.338 --> 06:05.838
Give him time.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.390
Time will not bring Davina back.

06:09.090 --> 06:12.228
The one chance to save
her was ruined by us.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.146
For our ends.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.899
Marcel's anger is justified.

06:18.436 --> 06:20.069
It's best I reach out to him

06:20.071 --> 06:23.239
before that anger hardens
into something worse.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.237
I didn't think anyone was here.

06:38.762 --> 06:41.006
Did you think I'd be at Cami's wake?

06:41.008 --> 06:42.458
You know what? It turns out,

06:42.460 --> 06:44.593
I hit my funeral quota

06:44.595 --> 06:45.663
for the day.

06:45.693 --> 06:47.129
Davina's was this morning.

06:47.131 --> 06:48.631
You remember her.

06:48.633 --> 06:51.684
Love of my life, condemned
to an unknowable hell.

06:51.686 --> 06:54.303
And what's your excuse, Sister?

06:55.219 --> 06:58.057
Were you so overcome with
guilt at what you did,

06:58.059 --> 06:59.206
that you couldn't bring yourself

06:59.236 --> 07:01.860
to indulge in whiskey and finger food?

07:04.782 --> 07:06.198
Or were you just too busy

07:06.200 --> 07:08.700
desecrating more dead?

07:09.892 --> 07:12.421
Is this to be your hobby now?

07:14.345 --> 07:16.013
When Lucien died,

07:16.043 --> 07:17.626
he was convinced the prophecy

07:17.628 --> 07:19.028
would still unfold.

07:19.058 --> 07:20.696
I need to know if he was right.

07:20.698 --> 07:24.667
These are the remains
of his oracle Alexis.

07:24.669 --> 07:27.503
Hers was a power I barely understood,

07:27.505 --> 07:28.787
but now that my own strength

07:28.789 --> 07:30.789
has been augmented by the Ancestors,

07:30.791 --> 07:32.291
I can try to channel her.

07:32.293 --> 07:34.293
Forecast as she did, and find out

07:34.295 --> 07:36.350
if Lucien was right,
or if we can finally

07:36.380 --> 07:37.326
put this nightmare behind us.

07:37.356 --> 07:40.721
I personally hope the
bloody prophecy is true.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.753
You can all rot in Hell, for all I care.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.422
I'm just sorry I won't
be around to see it.

07:47.424 --> 07:48.674
Where are you going?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.175
None of your business.

07:50.177 --> 07:51.844
All right? There is nothing for me here.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.230
Kol...

07:54.605 --> 07:56.732
you know that's not true.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.567
Your family...

07:58.569 --> 08:00.435
Do not lecture me about family,

08:00.437 --> 08:01.854
sister, or not.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.740
Now, you may have spent your entire life

08:04.742 --> 08:06.024
searching for us,

08:06.026 --> 08:10.496
but I never, for a second, wanted you.

08:18.804 --> 08:20.911
KINNEY: There's something
strange going on in this city.

08:20.941 --> 08:22.274
I can't put my finger on it,

08:22.276 --> 08:23.776
but I need to know what it is.

08:23.778 --> 08:25.277
(Laughs)

08:25.279 --> 08:26.528
VINCENT: "And ye shall know the truth,

08:26.530 --> 08:28.280
and the truth shall set you free."

08:28.282 --> 08:29.948
Unless it don't.

08:29.950 --> 08:33.251
It might just be that
the truth is a curse, man.

08:33.254 --> 08:35.871
Maybe you should be more
careful what you wish for.

08:36.294 --> 08:37.294
Yeah.

08:40.126 --> 08:41.626
What happened to Cami?

08:42.826 --> 08:44.430
She died,

08:44.432 --> 08:46.181
and there was nothing that could be done

08:46.183 --> 08:47.766
to stop it, and that's it.

08:47.768 --> 08:48.967
People don't just die.

08:48.969 --> 08:50.302
They get sick,

08:50.304 --> 08:52.471
or they get into an accident,

08:52.473 --> 08:54.807
or somebody kills them.

08:54.809 --> 08:57.392
And all those things leave a trail.

08:57.394 --> 09:00.062
And hospital records,

09:00.064 --> 09:02.481
ambulance dispatches,
somebody calls 911.

09:02.483 --> 09:04.316
But not this time.

09:05.453 --> 09:06.702
Cami O'Connell is dead.

09:06.704 --> 09:08.203
There isn't even a death certificate,

09:08.205 --> 09:09.655
or a coroner's report, or anything.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.573
Anywhere.

09:11.575 --> 09:13.542
Look, man, you think you want to know.

09:13.544 --> 09:14.827
You do not want to know.

09:14.829 --> 09:16.495
Vince, you've known me a long time.

09:16.497 --> 09:19.832
I can handle the answers
to my own questions.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.083
If I get a feeling
something's not right,

09:21.085 --> 09:22.217
I gotta do something.

09:22.219 --> 09:24.720
I got that feeling now.

09:26.423 --> 09:28.223
I'm not letting this go.

09:33.564 --> 09:34.730
Okay.

09:37.268 --> 09:39.434
Come on.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.156
It's funny, you know, I missed out

09:44.158 --> 09:46.859
on the whole binge drinking
thing in college, but, ah,

09:46.861 --> 09:48.861
guess I'm making up for it with
the drowning my sorrows thing,

09:48.863 --> 09:50.612
so, cheers.

09:51.916 --> 09:53.282
Hey, you should slow down.

09:53.284 --> 09:55.617
(Chuckles) Maybe you should slow down.

09:55.619 --> 09:57.536
Hey, how about that
little declaration of war

09:57.538 --> 09:59.421
you made this morning?

09:59.423 --> 10:01.206
Yeah, you might want to
pump the brakes on that plan

10:01.208 --> 10:02.875
because, the Mikaelsons?

10:02.877 --> 10:04.376
They aren't exactly known for
letting bygones be bygones.

10:04.378 --> 10:06.545
Maybe I don't care.

10:06.547 --> 10:10.716
Maybe it's the Mikaelsons
who need to worry about me.

10:10.718 --> 10:12.768
Is that...?

10:12.770 --> 10:14.720
Lucien's serum.

10:14.722 --> 10:17.472
Oh, cool.

10:17.474 --> 10:19.391
So you're gonna die soon too.

10:19.393 --> 10:20.776
Well, that's good to know.

10:20.778 --> 10:23.028
I'll make sure I get
this suit cleaned stat.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.780
This'll make sure I can't die.

10:24.782 --> 10:26.398
Marcel,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.618
if you take that, you will
be the last thing on earth

10:29.620 --> 10:30.986
that can kill a Mikaelson.

10:30.988 --> 10:33.205
That's like open declaration of war.

10:33.207 --> 10:36.074
I mean, how'd that work out
for that Lucien guy, huh?

10:36.076 --> 10:37.326
And you know what? Best case scenario,

10:37.328 --> 10:38.710
what are you going to do?

10:38.712 --> 10:40.329
Hmm? You gonna kill all of them?

10:40.331 --> 10:42.631
Klaus, Elijah, Freya, Kol?

10:42.633 --> 10:45.050
Yeah, he's mad at them now,
but when push comes to shove,

10:45.052 --> 10:47.886
even Hayley chooses them over you.

10:49.173 --> 10:51.256
So are you really going
to take down everyone?

10:53.093 --> 10:55.978
And do you think that's what
Davina would have wanted?

11:09.326 --> 11:10.609
Anything?

11:10.611 --> 11:11.944
There's too many pieces.

11:11.946 --> 11:14.079
Every time I get close
to seeing something,

11:14.081 --> 11:16.365
it all just fades away.

11:36.136 --> 11:38.637
Finish it.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.232
FREYA: You will all fall.

11:50.234 --> 11:52.868
One by friend, one by foe,

11:52.870 --> 11:54.786
and one... by family.

12:10.279 --> 12:11.473
ELIJAH: What the hell did I just see?

12:11.503 --> 12:12.812
Vincent told me he found a way

12:12.814 --> 12:14.314
to extract the serum from Aurora.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.815
I was busy at the time,

12:15.817 --> 12:18.602
but if Vincent did steal
the serum... if he...

12:18.604 --> 12:21.237
If he gave it to Marcel...

12:21.239 --> 12:23.440
We're in trouble.

12:24.192 --> 12:25.492
Yeah.

12:33.001 --> 12:35.835
Missed you at Davina's memorial.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.626
I thought my presence there
would be inappropriate.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.546
Because you and your family
threw her to the wolves?

12:46.548 --> 12:47.881
Yeah.

12:47.883 --> 12:50.550
You probably made the right call.

12:50.552 --> 12:53.303
I know how much you cared for her.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.939
This must be difficult for you.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.691
(Scoffs)

12:57.693 --> 12:59.859
That's funny.

12:59.861 --> 13:02.946
'Cause that doesn't
sound like an apology.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.399
Marcel... I had a chance to save her.

13:06.401 --> 13:08.201
To bring her back.

13:08.203 --> 13:09.536
But no.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.738
The Mikaelsons decided
that couldn't happen.

13:11.740 --> 13:13.740
Not if it was inconvenient for them.

13:13.742 --> 13:17.243
It seems you're always willing
to watch the world burn,

13:17.245 --> 13:18.578
long as you survive.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.547
Lucien had to die.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.998
He would have destroyed us all.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.551
Yeah. Thanks to his
vendetta against you.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.469
His motive is not the issue.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.588
He was a threat. We responded in kind.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.090
Had Freya the power to kill Lucien,

13:30.092 --> 13:31.474
and save Davina, she would have.

13:31.476 --> 13:34.427
Am I supposed to just
nod and accept that?

13:34.429 --> 13:36.763
We share a bourbon, and I just...

13:37.816 --> 13:40.066
shrug it off.

13:40.068 --> 13:41.518
Davina had to die.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.687
What a shame, but there was

13:43.689 --> 13:44.938
no other choice.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.239
There wasn't.

13:46.241 --> 13:47.440
(Scoffs)

13:50.912 --> 13:53.947
What am I to you, Klaus?

13:53.949 --> 13:55.498
Am I your friend?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.367
Your sidekick?

13:57.369 --> 13:59.035
I mean, at first, I was a charity case.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.286
We all know that.

14:00.288 --> 14:01.454
How about now?

14:01.456 --> 14:04.007
Am I your ally?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.459
'Cause you sure as hell
don't treat me like one.

14:06.461 --> 14:09.796
You and I are bonded by blood.

14:09.798 --> 14:12.515
And yes, we quarrel,

14:12.517 --> 14:14.184
but that is what family does.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.436
Oh, okay.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.304
So I'm family.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.726
No. I don't see it.

14:22.728 --> 14:27.197
Once upon a time, you were my mentor,

14:27.199 --> 14:28.565
my savior.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.233
My sire.

14:30.235 --> 14:32.952
But you've never been my brother.

14:32.954 --> 14:34.654
And now...

14:34.656 --> 14:37.407
- now you're nothing to me.
- Marcellus,

14:37.409 --> 14:42.545
just give me one last
chance to prove you wrong.

14:43.381 --> 14:45.582
Come with me.

14:49.004 --> 14:50.303
(Sighs)

15:17.365 --> 15:19.199
The serum...

15:19.201 --> 15:21.251
there's no trace of it in her.

15:22.404 --> 15:23.953
We need to warn Klaus.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.723
- He's not answering.
- Elijah,

15:26.725 --> 15:28.842
the power I stole from the Ancestors,

15:28.844 --> 15:31.044
it was enough to deal with Lucien,

15:31.046 --> 15:32.796
but that power's faded.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.431
If Marcel takes that
serum and becomes the beast

15:35.433 --> 15:37.350
foretold in the prophecy,

15:37.352 --> 15:39.302
I won't be able to stop him.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.306
Locate Niklaus. I'll find Marcel.

15:52.701 --> 15:56.703
(Music box plays light, gentle melody)

16:10.536 --> 16:11.885
Freya?

16:12.804 --> 16:15.004
Who's there?

16:17.976 --> 16:20.093
What the hell is this?

16:20.095 --> 16:22.345
(Eerie, indistinct whispering)

16:22.347 --> 16:24.314
Who's doing this?

16:26.318 --> 16:28.601
(Door slams shut)

16:28.603 --> 16:29.986
(Whispering continues)

16:38.330 --> 16:39.495
(Choking and gasping)

16:39.497 --> 16:40.780
Davina! I...

16:40.782 --> 16:42.031
I didn't mean to hurt you.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.116
I loved you.

16:43.118 --> 16:44.534
(Gasping)

16:45.120 --> 16:47.337
(Panting)

16:55.013 --> 16:57.513
KINNEY: Wow. Nice little fixer-upper.

16:58.683 --> 17:01.434
I can't sell it, and I can't rent it,

17:01.436 --> 17:03.136
'cause everybody thinks it's haunted.

17:03.138 --> 17:05.605
That's what happens
when your crazy ex-wife

17:05.607 --> 17:07.307
used to perform ritual sacrifice

17:07.309 --> 17:09.692
in your parlor room.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.694
(Laughs)

17:12.696 --> 17:15.982
You said you wanted to know.

17:15.983 --> 17:18.984
Jesus, Vincent, I thought I was crazy.

17:18.987 --> 17:22.655
You're telling me that voodoo,
black magic, angry spirits...

17:22.656 --> 17:23.873
All that stuff is real?

17:23.875 --> 17:26.409
Those of us who practice witchcraft,

17:26.411 --> 17:28.711
we're supposed to be
keepers of the balance.

17:28.713 --> 17:30.747
Sometimes power corrupts.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.382
Now, the covens won't
even come near this place,

17:32.384 --> 17:34.667
and even regular people, they...

17:34.669 --> 17:36.586
they walk past it, and they're like,

17:36.588 --> 17:39.923
oh, this place is seven
different kinds of wrong.

17:40.531 --> 17:42.398
And they're right to be afraid.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.823
Once upon a time...

17:59.327 --> 18:01.361
my crazy ex-wife Eva,

18:01.363 --> 18:04.664
she tried to siphon the
power of our Ancestors,

18:04.666 --> 18:06.282
and she created this.

18:06.284 --> 18:09.585
It's called "un depot d'argente".

18:09.587 --> 18:11.421
It's a mystical battery cell.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.873
It's capable of storing

18:13.875 --> 18:16.676
all kinds of just negative mojo.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.879
Uh, and how does that thing help us?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.714
(Quiet laugh)

18:21.716 --> 18:25.468
Witches are supposed to be
the protectors of New Orleans.

18:25.470 --> 18:26.719
And we were,

18:26.721 --> 18:28.638
until our Ancestors, they came along,

18:28.640 --> 18:29.889
and they made a deal with the Devil,

18:29.891 --> 18:31.357
in the form of Lucien Castle.

18:31.359 --> 18:33.776
See, that's what got Cami killed.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.895
Now, Lucien's gone, but
those same Ancestors,

18:35.897 --> 18:38.147
they want to start a war with a family,

18:38.149 --> 18:41.617
a very old and powerful
family called the Mikaelsons.

18:41.619 --> 18:43.453
Look, man, it's a long
story, and the only thing

18:43.455 --> 18:44.988
you need to know is that
some innocent people are gonna

18:44.990 --> 18:46.572
get hurt, because the
Ancestors, they don't

18:46.574 --> 18:48.541
give a damn if this whole
city becomes a war zone.

18:48.543 --> 18:50.543
And the only way we're
going to stop the bloodshed

18:50.545 --> 18:52.295
- is if we do something about it.
- We?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.297
We're going to put
this in the right place.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.915
We're going to set it off,

18:55.917 --> 18:58.084
and we're going to sever
the Ancestors' connection

18:58.086 --> 18:59.469
to the world of the living.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.387
Wipe the slate clean.

19:03.975 --> 19:06.426
MARCEL: It's a long way
to go to make a point.

19:06.428 --> 19:09.145
KLAUS: Surely you remember this place.

19:09.726 --> 19:10.783
Yeah.

19:11.267 --> 19:12.605
Sure.

19:14.436 --> 19:16.736
Two, three bridges ago,

19:16.738 --> 19:19.322
this is where you had me
scatter my father's ashes.

19:19.997 --> 19:21.941
You were still newly turned,

19:21.943 --> 19:24.861
and I feared the brilliant,
kind-hearted boy I raised

19:24.863 --> 19:26.612
would be lost in a cloud of rage,

19:26.614 --> 19:27.947
so I brought you here,

19:27.949 --> 19:30.083
to the bridge our family crossed

19:30.085 --> 19:31.951
when we first brought you home.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.836
The threshold

19:33.838 --> 19:36.005
between your past and your future.

19:36.007 --> 19:40.460
Long before you realized how
much we loved New Orleans.

19:40.462 --> 19:43.513
A love that was born
alongside our love for you,

19:43.515 --> 19:45.548
our family's newest member.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.217
You can say that as
many times as you like,

19:48.219 --> 19:49.519
doesn't make it so.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.270
You may hate me,

19:51.272 --> 19:53.856
but your hatred only
marks you as my kin.

19:53.858 --> 19:56.359
From the moment I met you,

19:56.361 --> 19:57.977
I saw myself in you.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.195
And when I brought you here,

19:59.197 --> 20:00.897
to scatter your father's remains,

20:00.899 --> 20:02.815
you did something I never could:

20:02.817 --> 20:06.369
You released your hate to the wind.

20:07.822 --> 20:11.290
And it was that day I saw
your full potential.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.629
And I knew you to be my son.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.002
(Laughing)

20:23.004 --> 20:25.004
Did you remind me of all that,

20:25.006 --> 20:27.840
hoping I'd feel like
I owe you something?

20:27.842 --> 20:29.258
Huh?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.395
Let me tell you, being
a part of your life

20:32.397 --> 20:34.013
hasn't exactly been a gift.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.933
And whatever debts I owe,
I paid them back, all right?

20:36.935 --> 20:39.519
A long, long time ago.

20:39.521 --> 20:42.405
If one of us is standing in the red,

20:43.164 --> 20:45.469
I'm going to say it's you.

20:54.636 --> 20:56.590
Nice view.

20:59.228 --> 21:00.895
Pretty sunset.

21:00.897 --> 21:03.364
Why ruin it with more talk?

21:03.366 --> 21:04.732
At this point,

21:04.734 --> 21:07.034
it's just noise.

21:07.036 --> 21:08.452
You are so like me.

21:08.454 --> 21:10.371
Stubborn, full of anger.

21:10.373 --> 21:11.952
I'm nothing like you.

21:11.982 --> 21:13.040
You're wrong.

21:14.293 --> 21:17.411
You see, I raised you in my image,

21:17.413 --> 21:18.796
and yet, when you thrived,

21:18.798 --> 21:21.215
I allowed my worst fears to take root.

21:21.217 --> 21:23.634
Instead of feeling pride
of the man you'd become,

21:23.636 --> 21:26.387
I began to feel a sense
of unease, of distrust.

21:27.193 --> 21:29.506
And I feared

21:29.508 --> 21:32.593
you would become my better.

21:33.476 --> 21:35.896
I never wanted to be better than you.

21:36.082 --> 21:39.683
Not until you started
trying to hold me down.

21:43.489 --> 21:45.239
I haven't done enough...

21:47.455 --> 21:49.259
well enough,

21:49.261 --> 21:50.511
when it comes to you.

21:50.513 --> 21:53.180
But you and I are bonded by fate,

21:53.182 --> 21:54.598
by history,

21:54.600 --> 21:55.983
and by blood.

21:55.985 --> 21:59.592
And you, Marcel,

21:59.622 --> 22:01.923
will always be my family.

22:04.877 --> 22:06.344
MAN: Gentlemen.

22:09.465 --> 22:12.216
Am I interrupting something?

22:14.520 --> 22:17.722
(Dixieland jazz playing)

22:22.530 --> 22:26.364
(Indistinct chanting)

22:26.799 --> 22:29.400
NOPD! Freeze! Hands up!

22:29.430 --> 22:30.757
KINNEY: All right!

22:30.787 --> 22:33.192
Psycho slumber party's over.

22:33.222 --> 22:35.356
We got reports of
health code violations,

22:35.358 --> 22:36.607
animal cruelty,

22:36.609 --> 22:38.192
and felony creepiness.

22:38.194 --> 22:41.394
Good luck pleading out of
that. Get them out of here.

22:47.870 --> 22:48.870
(Shudders)

22:50.563 --> 22:51.672
(Muttering)

22:51.702 --> 22:52.907
Okay.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.847
You all right, man?

22:59.849 --> 23:01.682
Yeah, man, just tell me
you got what you need.

23:01.684 --> 23:02.766
I got what I need

23:02.768 --> 23:04.017
to do what needs doing.

23:04.019 --> 23:06.136
Great.

23:06.138 --> 23:07.638
Want to tell me what that is?

23:09.525 --> 23:11.108
Okay, cemeteries in New Orleans

23:11.110 --> 23:13.560
were designed to house the
spirits of our Ancestors.

23:13.562 --> 23:15.979
And there are places, sacred places,

23:15.981 --> 23:18.315
that help them focus their energy

23:18.317 --> 23:19.817
so that they can access this world.

23:19.819 --> 23:21.174
Like a cell phone tower?

23:21.204 --> 23:22.403
More powerful, but yeah.

23:22.405 --> 23:24.154
Think about it as a way where our world

23:24.156 --> 23:26.373
and the spirit world actually meet.

23:26.375 --> 23:28.409
And one of those places is a tomb.

23:28.411 --> 23:30.271
It's the cornerstone of the link
between the living and the dead.

23:30.301 --> 23:32.663
It's the seat of their power

23:32.665 --> 23:36.050
and the means through which
they influence this world.

23:38.087 --> 23:40.588
I'm gonna go into their world with this,

23:40.590 --> 23:42.423
and I'm gonna use every drop of power

23:42.425 --> 23:43.641
and crack the foundation.

23:43.643 --> 23:44.642
Cut off the signal.

23:44.644 --> 23:46.093
Yes.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.729
Wait, you said you were
gonna go into their world?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.514
Never mind that now.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.017
What I need you to do is handle
things on this end, all right?

23:53.019 --> 23:55.269
A magical surge that big
is gonna send out shockwaves

23:55.271 --> 23:56.520
throughout all our cemeteries.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.155
Yeah, well, NOLA PD can clear it out.

23:58.157 --> 23:59.156
I can say there's a bomb threat.

23:59.158 --> 24:00.774
Do whatever you have to do,

24:00.776 --> 24:02.487
but make sure there is no one around
when this thing goes down.

24:02.517 --> 24:03.527
Yeah.

24:04.012 --> 24:05.696
Hey, Vince,

24:06.561 --> 24:09.333
how are you gonna get that
thing into this spirit world?

24:09.683 --> 24:11.329
KOL: Simple.

24:12.588 --> 24:14.705
He's got to die.

24:15.228 --> 24:17.041
Who the hell is that guy?

24:18.811 --> 24:20.344
ELIJAH: Step aside, Niklaus.

24:20.346 --> 24:22.463
Elijah, this is a private conversation.

24:22.465 --> 24:23.797
Your concerns can wait.

24:23.799 --> 24:25.015
No, they cannot.

24:25.017 --> 24:26.934
Same Mikaelson drama.

24:26.936 --> 24:28.719
One of you is trying to make peace,

24:28.721 --> 24:30.271
the other one is eyeing me

24:30.273 --> 24:31.522
like I'm a rabid dog.

24:31.524 --> 24:33.057
Well, then tell me my concerns

24:33.059 --> 24:34.608
are unfounded, Marcellus.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.193
Oh, what, I got to prove myself?

24:36.195 --> 24:37.380
To you?

24:37.410 --> 24:39.563
Davina was like a daughter
to me and you condemned her

24:39.565 --> 24:41.315
to a fate worse than death.

24:41.317 --> 24:45.152
So how is it my job
to prove myself to you?

24:45.154 --> 24:47.121
All right, that's enough. Both of you.

24:47.123 --> 24:49.540
You tell me where it is.

24:54.606 --> 24:56.452
What?

24:57.550 --> 24:58.999
This?

25:03.089 --> 25:04.672
KOL: You're not going to blow up

25:04.674 --> 25:06.390
the Ancestral well by yourself.

25:06.392 --> 25:07.392
Kol,

25:08.427 --> 25:10.894
whatever help you're trying to
offer me, I'm not interested.

25:10.896 --> 25:13.480
I'm coming with you, I'm
not asking for permission.

25:13.849 --> 25:14.849
Besides...

25:15.818 --> 25:17.601
Davina's the one who brought me here.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.769
Davina's gone, Kol.

25:18.771 --> 25:20.270
Parts of Davina remain.

25:20.272 --> 25:23.524
Fragments of her soul
bound to those she loved.

25:23.526 --> 25:25.109
I saw her, Vincent.

25:25.111 --> 25:26.694
And she is reaching out to me,

25:26.696 --> 25:28.362
and I have to reach back.

25:29.294 --> 25:30.748
I need to see her.

25:37.757 --> 25:39.206
(Exhales)

25:41.594 --> 25:43.594
(Sighs)

25:43.596 --> 25:45.346
Come on, Kol.

25:48.812 --> 25:50.267
What the hell is that?

25:50.269 --> 25:51.969
ELIJAH: That, my dear brother,

25:51.971 --> 25:55.055
is a wicked little gift
from our friend Vincent.

25:55.057 --> 25:56.557
MARCEL: I guess he figured

25:56.559 --> 25:58.058
better me than Aurora.

25:58.060 --> 26:00.811
And now that I got it,
I can't help but think

26:00.813 --> 26:02.146
why not take it?

26:02.148 --> 26:04.314
I mean, loyalty never got me anywhere.

26:04.316 --> 26:06.650
And the only thing you
respond to is a show of force.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.236
Marcellus, end this
foolishness right now.

26:09.238 --> 26:10.404
Or else what?

26:10.406 --> 26:14.124
I mean, I'm family, right?

26:14.126 --> 26:17.327
Why would this little serum
have to change anything,

26:17.329 --> 26:21.131
other than the simple fact
that I would be your equal?

26:21.689 --> 26:23.188
Oh, yeah.

26:23.365 --> 26:25.965
I figured you could
never live with that.

26:25.996 --> 26:27.888
You hand it over right now

26:27.890 --> 26:29.840
and I will forgive this act of defiance

26:29.842 --> 26:31.258
as a moment of weakness

26:31.260 --> 26:33.510
- brought on by your grief.
- Oh, that's funny.

26:33.512 --> 26:35.679
I thought you came
asking for my forgiveness,

26:35.681 --> 26:37.598
but you like it better
this way, don't you?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.600
Me owing you.

26:39.602 --> 26:40.768
And all that pretty fairy tale

26:40.770 --> 26:42.186
about me being part of the family?

26:42.188 --> 26:44.188
That only works if you're in control.

26:44.190 --> 26:45.906
Klaus Mikaelson,

26:45.908 --> 26:48.075
smiling down like a benevolent king.

26:48.077 --> 26:50.027
Showing mercy to all his subjects.

26:50.029 --> 26:53.614
But you still have to be the king!

26:53.616 --> 26:54.832
Don't you?

26:56.118 --> 26:58.168
The thing about kings, though...

26:59.538 --> 27:02.372
eventually, they all fall.

27:02.374 --> 27:03.957
Even you, Klaus.

27:03.959 --> 27:05.342
(Electricity crackling, buzzing)

27:28.253 --> 27:30.821
Well, there ain't no party
like a cemetery party.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.923
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah.

27:34.258 --> 27:36.008
Davina's favorite record.

27:39.230 --> 27:41.564
So, how exactly does an Original vampire

27:41.566 --> 27:43.316
get to go to witch purgatory?

27:43.470 --> 27:45.117
I died a witch.

27:45.119 --> 27:47.103
I spent months there,
trapped and tormented

27:47.105 --> 27:48.487
by the Ancestors.

27:49.405 --> 27:50.906
Once we cross over,

27:50.908 --> 27:53.108
we're gonna be in enemy territory.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.317
We're gonna have to move
quick to conjure Davina

27:55.347 --> 27:56.562
and get the bomb set.

27:56.564 --> 27:57.964
Otherwise, (grunts)

27:57.966 --> 27:59.599
the Ancestors are
gonna shut us both down.

28:00.166 --> 28:02.473
Hmm. Okay. Well, maybe just make sure

28:02.503 --> 28:03.953
that doesn't happen?

28:06.550 --> 28:08.090
Really?

28:08.092 --> 28:09.291
Hemlock?

28:09.293 --> 28:10.343
Old school.

28:10.807 --> 28:12.878
Respect.

28:15.383 --> 28:17.550
(Chanting): Prezeve lyen lavi nou...

28:17.552 --> 28:19.635
Prezeve lyen lavi nou.

28:19.637 --> 28:21.770
Prezeve lyen lavi nou...

28:21.772 --> 28:22.972
(Gasps)

28:48.299 --> 28:49.665
ELIJAH: Give it to me now.

28:49.667 --> 28:52.167
I won't ask you again, Marcellus.

28:52.169 --> 28:53.385
My name...

28:53.387 --> 28:55.304
is Marcel.

28:55.306 --> 28:57.278
And I'm not giving you a damn thing.

28:57.308 --> 29:00.226
I can't allow you the
means to destroy my family.

29:00.228 --> 29:02.144
Your family. Right.

29:02.146 --> 29:03.018
Thank you.

29:03.048 --> 29:04.497
Klaus, Marcel will betray us.

29:04.499 --> 29:06.416
I saw it with my own eyes.

29:06.418 --> 29:08.178
I will betray you?

29:08.208 --> 29:09.335
I asked,

29:09.337 --> 29:11.469
begged for your help,

29:11.499 --> 29:13.689
and you left Davina to rot.

29:13.691 --> 29:16.692
You put down Lucien because
he was coming for you,

29:16.694 --> 29:18.369
for your family, but the thing is,

29:18.399 --> 29:20.952
you made Lucien.

29:20.982 --> 29:24.255
You turned him, taught
him, and then abandoned him.

29:24.285 --> 29:25.751
And then you blamed Lucien

29:25.753 --> 29:28.078
because it's always
somebody else's fault.

29:28.108 --> 29:31.507
But maybe you were the
villains in his story.

29:31.975 --> 29:35.183
After all, that is the
Mikaelson way, right?

29:35.646 --> 29:40.049
Kill, maim, torture, all
in the name of family.

29:40.679 --> 29:44.169
Always and forever.

29:44.171 --> 29:46.672
I used to admire that vow.

29:48.426 --> 29:52.845
It gave me back the thing
that had been beaten out of me.

29:54.148 --> 29:56.982
Faith in those you love.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.486
I was a fool.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.466
Always and forever is just an excuse

30:08.496 --> 30:10.379
to do whatever the hell you want.

30:13.168 --> 30:15.918
Maybe...

30:15.920 --> 30:18.087
it's time someone put an end to that.

30:18.089 --> 30:20.640
You are treading very close
to a dangerous decision.

30:25.930 --> 30:28.981
I'm asking you to choose wisely.

30:34.989 --> 30:36.439
Fair enough.

30:44.115 --> 30:46.449
MARCEL: You can't stop me, Klaus.

30:46.451 --> 30:48.167
I only meant to keep
you from crossing a line

30:48.169 --> 30:49.619
you would most certainly regret.

30:49.621 --> 30:52.505
No, you meant to keep
your precious upper hand.

30:52.507 --> 30:53.789
Don't you get it?

30:53.791 --> 30:55.625
Whatever I have to do, Klaus,

30:55.627 --> 30:57.543
I will find a way to hurt you.

30:59.130 --> 31:02.431
You will never be safe,
not as long as I am alive.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.772
You can call me family all you want,

31:05.802 --> 31:07.453
I am done being your friend.

31:07.455 --> 31:08.704
From this day forward,

31:08.706 --> 31:10.789
I am nothing less than your worst...

31:10.791 --> 31:13.092
(Thudding, squishing)

31:20.718 --> 31:22.267
No!

31:27.808 --> 31:29.642
(Panting)

31:43.917 --> 31:45.240
VINCENT (softly): Okay.

31:50.030 --> 31:55.366
Localiser nan motus
qui souffre de patitur.

31:57.255 --> 31:59.806
(Eerie, indistinct whispering)

31:59.808 --> 32:01.390
DAVINA: Kol?

32:02.143 --> 32:03.646
- Davina!
- It hurts!

32:03.676 --> 32:04.676
(Groans)

32:04.997 --> 32:06.796
I knew you'd hear me.

32:06.798 --> 32:07.864
I'm here, luv.

32:07.866 --> 32:08.999
I'm listening.

32:10.002 --> 32:11.835
(Groans lightly)

32:17.843 --> 32:19.593
KLAUS: The current took him.

32:21.847 --> 32:23.430
Niklaus, I saw Freya's vision.

32:23.432 --> 32:24.814
What did you do?

32:27.064 --> 32:28.602
I could've talked him down.

32:28.604 --> 32:31.021
- I could...
- You could've what?

32:32.357 --> 32:33.940
You could've watched
our family's extinction

32:33.942 --> 32:35.358
at the hands of Marcel Gerard.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.410
He was one of us!

32:38.589 --> 32:40.997
He despised us.

32:40.999 --> 32:44.618
Yes, he was our friend,
yes, he was our family.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.787
The moment Davina Claire
was lost, he became our foe,

32:47.789 --> 32:49.956
and a formidable one at that.

32:49.958 --> 32:51.958
He was the leader of the Strix,

32:51.960 --> 32:53.593
entrusted with all of our secrets,

32:53.595 --> 32:54.896
and then, Klaus,

32:54.926 --> 32:56.763
we betrayed him.

32:59.217 --> 33:02.052
I had no choice.

33:08.977 --> 33:12.112
Do you really believe that?

33:21.790 --> 33:23.707
VINCENT: Here we go.

33:24.743 --> 33:26.660
You've done enough, Vincent.

33:27.133 --> 33:28.712
You should go.

33:29.672 --> 33:31.247
Davina, I can't just walk out.

33:31.249 --> 33:33.805
When this is over, the
Ancestors will be cut off.

33:35.171 --> 33:37.337
It'll be a new beginning
for the witches.

33:37.339 --> 33:38.471
They'll need someone to lead them.

33:38.473 --> 33:39.422
Davina, I'm not gonna let...

33:39.424 --> 33:40.640
Vincent...

33:42.678 --> 33:45.312
I'm not asking.

No, it was before that.

35:32.054 --> 35:35.422
I was dead for ages, Davina.

35:36.065 --> 35:37.507
And when I woke up,

35:37.509 --> 35:40.393
it was a mess of
manipulation and family drama

35:40.395 --> 35:42.012
in a body I didn't know.

35:42.014 --> 35:45.148
All this anger I couldn't shake.

35:45.150 --> 35:49.736
And that very night, I
saw you leaving the church

35:49.738 --> 35:51.771
with this look on your face,

35:51.773 --> 35:54.608
like the whole world
was on your shoulders.

35:55.073 --> 35:58.245
You brushed up against some dead flowers

35:58.247 --> 36:00.163
and you stopped.

36:00.165 --> 36:01.665
You looked around,

36:01.667 --> 36:03.667
and you brought those
flowers back to life

36:03.669 --> 36:05.835
- with your magic.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.038
And you smiled,

36:08.040 --> 36:11.541
and something inside
of me cracked wide open.

36:11.940 --> 36:14.544
I was dead for ages, Davina Claire,

36:15.017 --> 36:18.965
and only then did I feel alive again.

38:10.143 --> 38:13.151
Freya showed me what Elijah saw.

38:13.181 --> 38:15.598
The prophecies haven't been wrong once.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.806
Klaus, after everything
that you have done,

38:17.836 --> 38:20.025
all the people that you've
threatened, tortured, killed,

38:20.055 --> 38:21.972
all the pain that you
have put him through,

38:21.974 --> 38:23.824
he has always forgiven you.

38:24.795 --> 38:27.060
You have to forgive him.

38:35.654 --> 38:37.454
You sound like Camille.

39:09.439 --> 39:11.354
Yeah.

39:11.356 --> 39:13.824
Ancestors are cut off.

39:13.826 --> 39:15.358
We're free.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.694
Now I just got to get things
moving in the right direction

39:17.696 --> 39:18.796
on this end.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.940
Hey, look, man,

39:21.386 --> 39:22.682
I couldn't have done
it without you, man.

39:22.684 --> 39:23.816
Thank you.

39:23.818 --> 39:24.818
Yeah.

39:26.821 --> 39:30.907
You know, I spent months feeling
like I was losing my mind.

39:32.223 --> 39:35.445
Like there was something
out there in the darkness.

39:35.447 --> 39:39.332
Waiting for me.

39:39.334 --> 39:41.361
I thought it was all in my head.

39:41.391 --> 39:42.808
No...

39:44.923 --> 39:47.123
(Chuckles) Thank you, Vincent.

39:47.125 --> 39:49.792
- No, man.
- No, for trusting me with the truth.

40:12.150 --> 40:15.118
I think part of him sees that already.

41:04.786 --> 41:05.786
Hamlet.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.539
We taught Marcel to
read with this very copy.

41:10.305 --> 41:11.624
Cool.

41:11.626 --> 41:13.176
Well, he's not here, so...

41:13.673 --> 41:14.673
He's dead.

41:24.791 --> 41:26.856
The serum.

41:26.858 --> 41:29.548
No, Marcel didn't take it.

41:29.578 --> 41:31.544
Because of me.

41:31.546 --> 41:33.496
No, if I hadn't convinced him to wait...

41:33.498 --> 41:35.999
No, is that what you really think?

41:36.001 --> 41:39.168
You think that because Marcel
wanted them to think that.

41:43.115 --> 41:45.329
Now, the truth is,
Marcel took that serum

41:45.359 --> 41:46.431
the moment I offered it to him.

41:46.461 --> 41:48.344
He didn't even hesitate.

41:51.216 --> 41:53.683
So, if the Mikaelsons think he's dead...

41:55.136 --> 41:57.470
they're in for a hell of a surprise.
