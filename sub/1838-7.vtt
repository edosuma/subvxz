WE HEARD YOU CRYING.

20:16.033 --> 20:18.767
HEY, MAN,
I WAS NOT CRYING!

20:18.767 --> 20:20.400
I WAS MEDITATING.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.700
I WANNA THANK YOU GUYS

THE SHOW.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.500

RIGHT?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.500
OH, YEAH,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.734
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD NEVER TELL
ANYONE YOUR SECRET,

20:34.734 --> 20:35.667
AND I THINK
IT'S SO COOL

20:35.667 --> 20:37.900
THAT YOU DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE BEN'S.

20:37.900 --> 20:38.867

20:38.867 --> 20:39.834
NO PROBLEM. OH!

20:39.834 --> 20:41.033

SO WE'RE CLEAR,

20:41.033 --> 20:42.867
YOU'RE NEVER
KISSING HIM AGAIN.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.500
YEAH. NEVER.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.834

20:49.834 --> 20:50.734
EDDIE! NO, NO!

20:50.734 --> 20:51.800
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO EAT THEM.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAVE THEM.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.600
OH, WELL, SEE,
I CAN DO BOTH.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.300
