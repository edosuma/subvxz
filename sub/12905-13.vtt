00:00.316 --> 00:02.548
- Morning.
- Floater.

00:02.584 --> 00:04.917
Manhole.

00:04.953 --> 00:06.352
What are you doing?

00:06.388 --> 00:08.054
Well, I've been thinking about

00:08.089 --> 00:10.123
how you're leaving
for the FBI Academy,

00:10.158 --> 00:12.325
and I'm going to Paris.
Teeth.

00:13.895 --> 00:15.528
Statues.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.864
This is your idea of
a trip down memory lane?

00:17.899 --> 00:20.700
I realize that most of
our shared experiences

00:20.735 --> 00:22.902
- aren't documented.
- You mean other than

00:22.937 --> 00:24.637
with extensive
departmental paperwork

00:24.672 --> 00:25.705
and court transcripts?

00:25.740 --> 00:27.607
Which are cold and impersonal,

00:27.642 --> 00:30.376
so I have decided to make
a virtual memory book.

00:30.412 --> 00:32.645
- With crime scene photos?
- Yes.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.415
I mean, how many fascinating
crime scenes have we shared?

00:35.450 --> 00:39.852
- Community theater.
- Sex party.

00:39.888 --> 00:41.988
Revolutionary War reenactment.

00:42.023 --> 00:45.058
High school reunion.

00:45.093 --> 00:46.959
- Refrigerator.
- Body farm.

00:47.695 --> 00:49.729
Church.
Fishing tournament.

00:55.303 --> 00:56.536
I'm going to miss you.

00:58.206 --> 01:03.409
- Well, I'm not gone yet.
- No, but almost.

01:03.445 --> 01:05.945
How many more of these
experiences are we gonna have?

01:11.319 --> 01:12.785
Well, unless this is my mother

01:12.821 --> 01:15.354
demanding more cheese curls
for Korsak's retirement party,

01:15.390 --> 01:18.391
I'd say at least one more.

01:18.426 --> 01:21.094
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

01:21.596 --> 01:23.763
Remember that guy?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:42.256 --> 01:45.140
<b>7x13 - "Ocean Frank"</b>

01:50.024 --> 01:52.158
Wow.

01:52.193 --> 01:54.160
Doesn't seem so sexy when
it ends up like that?

01:54.195 --> 01:57.730
Robert Riley, 35 years old.
Apparently married.

01:57.765 --> 01:59.165
<i>- Is she here?
- No.</i>

01:59.200 --> 02:01.901
And it looks like a suitcase
is missing from the closet.

02:01.936 --> 02:05.338
Her underwear drawer is empty.

02:05.373 --> 02:09.375
If I'm running for my life,
I'm not sure I'd take the time.

02:09.410 --> 02:11.511
But if I'm packing to leave
after I kill my husband...

02:11.546 --> 02:12.845
<i>Well, clean underwear would be</i>

02:12.881 --> 02:14.247
at the top of my on-the-lam list.

02:14.282 --> 02:16.115
Life on the lam
would be a little rough

02:16.151 --> 02:18.618
- at the Four Seasons, Ma Barker.
- Cute.

02:18.653 --> 02:21.087
But you'd never find me.
I'd be at the Ritz.

02:21.122 --> 02:23.623
Anyway, it appears as though
our victim has been decapitated.

02:23.658 --> 02:27.193
No disrespect, Doc,
but that head is still on that neck.

02:27.228 --> 02:31.097
An orthopedic decapitation,
an Atlanto-Occipital dislocation.

02:31.132 --> 02:32.832
Well, what do you know?

02:32.867 --> 02:34.834
Can that happen
in some weird sex game?

02:35.637 --> 02:36.669
Can't say.

02:38.006 --> 02:43.309
Maura, just one little guess.
A small surmise.

02:45.413 --> 02:48.881
It appears as though he
received a high-energy strike

02:48.917 --> 02:51.317
from a very large, blunt object...

02:51.352 --> 02:53.319
something flexible
and without rough edges.

02:53.354 --> 02:55.855
- Did you find any balloon animals?
- Not even a balloon.

02:56.658 --> 03:00.243
All right, I will check with Frankie,
have him search

03:00.244 --> 03:03.829
the neighborhood, see if anybody
saw a rogue blimp on the loose.

03:06.301 --> 03:07.533
I shouldn't have said anything.

03:07.569 --> 03:11.604
And miss all this fun?
Aw, gee, Maura.

03:11.639 --> 03:13.806
<i>It had to be Panda.</i>

03:13.841 --> 03:17.043
<i>Nothing like this
ever happens around here.</i>

03:17.078 --> 03:19.345
If it did, I would know.

03:19.380 --> 03:22.181
- Did Robert and his wife ever...
- Elaine... that's her name.

03:22.217 --> 03:23.883
And did Robert and Elaine ever fight?

03:23.918 --> 03:27.053
I wouldn't know
what goes on behind closed doors.

03:27.088 --> 03:31.090
- Did you ever hear them arguing?
- No. No, not at all.

03:31.125 --> 03:35.161
I do know that Robert would, 
leave every morning at 8:00,

03:35.196 --> 03:36.429
I assume to work.

03:36.464 --> 03:39.632
He came back at about noon,
stayed for an hour,

03:39.667 --> 03:42.835
and then, left again until 5:00.

03:42.870 --> 03:45.671
I'm sorry, Detective.
My mom means to be helpful.

03:45.707 --> 03:49.442
- She is. And your name is...?
- Steve. Steve Browning.

03:49.477 --> 03:52.445
- Did you know the Rileys?
- Not really.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.415
- Is this connected to the break-ins?
- Break-ins?

03:56.451 --> 03:59.185
Mom, didn't you say
something about a black truck?

03:59.220 --> 04:00.519
That's right.

04:00.555 --> 04:04.223
I saw it several times,
driving back and forth.

04:04.259 --> 04:08.127
Very suspicious. Very.

04:09.931 --> 04:11.656
<i>- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, Janey.</i>

04:11.691 --> 04:14.467
Okay, I better not be here
because I can reach high places.

04:14.502 --> 04:16.402
No, no, no.
I have something for you.

04:16.437 --> 04:18.738
I mean, I didn't mean for you
to rush on over.

04:18.773 --> 04:21.440
- Well, your text said it was important.
- It's important.

04:21.476 --> 04:23.809
It's just not urgent.

04:27.749 --> 04:29.382
It reminded me of you.

04:30.518 --> 04:32.551
Yeah...

04:32.587 --> 04:34.520
yeah, no, that's...
that's totally me.

04:34.555 --> 04:36.455
Yeah, well,
I figured where you're going,

04:36.491 --> 04:38.057
you would need an extra suitcase.

04:38.092 --> 04:40.626
Ma, I'm going to the FBI.
I'm not going on safari.

04:40.662 --> 04:42.762
Yeah, but you could have
school supplies and books

04:42.797 --> 04:45.831
- and manuals and stuff.
- Who carries manuals in a suitcase?

04:45.867 --> 04:48.901
I just want you to think
about me when you're gone.

04:48.936 --> 04:52.638
Ok-Okay, okay, okay.
Thank you.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.473
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

04:54.509 --> 04:55.608
And, you know, come on.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.443
You know, of course
I would think about you.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.013
But not because of this.
This is hideous.

05:01.049 --> 05:02.448
I'm going back to work.

05:05.787 --> 05:07.286
Hi.

05:07.322 --> 05:09.155
I started the search of
marriage records in Boston.

05:09.190 --> 05:10.823
According to this,

05:10.858 --> 05:14.527
Robert Riley and Elaine Chan
were married six months ago.

05:17.198 --> 05:20.333
- What?
- Nothing.

05:20.368 --> 05:23.803
Nope.

05:23.838 --> 05:25.538
What?

05:25.573 --> 05:27.873
- You can't kiss me at the office.
- I know that.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.344
You know, we do have to tell
everyone that we're engaged.

05:34.615 --> 05:38.017
<i>Hey!
What are you doing?</i>

05:38.052 --> 05:39.018
I wasn't spying.

05:39.053 --> 05:41.887
- It looks like you were spying.
- Yes, I know.

05:41.923 --> 05:44.190
It's just
no one will agree to do

05:44.225 --> 05:47.360
these testimonials
for the party, and I've...

05:47.395 --> 05:49.895
I've resorted to
sneaking up on people.

05:49.931 --> 05:52.231
- You need to erase that.
- Yeah. I will.

05:52.266 --> 05:54.200
I do not want to be
the spiller of beans.

05:54.235 --> 05:57.336
I'll record mine.
Come back in one hour.

05:57.372 --> 05:59.004
Thank you, Nina.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.540
And let me just be the first to say...

06:05.580 --> 06:08.681
- Thank you?
- That's beautiful. What's it mean?

06:08.716 --> 06:10.015
It means, "May you not see a pig

06:10.051 --> 06:11.975
on the way to your wedding."

06:15.990 --> 06:17.723
You guys rock.

06:17.759 --> 06:20.393
- One hour.
- Yeah. One hour.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.029
<i>- Hey, Jane!
- No.</i>

06:24.065 --> 06:25.865
<i>All right.
I'll catch you later then.</i>

06:33.474 --> 06:39.178
Unless that's Bass,
you got a suitcase from Ma.

06:39.213 --> 06:42.381
She told me it was meant to
complement my personality.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.784
Mine is covered in leopard spots.

06:44.819 --> 06:50.923
The leopard is incredibly
intelligent and astoundingly strong.

06:50.958 --> 06:53.426
They are elusive, secretive,
and beautiful.

06:53.461 --> 06:56.762
- I'm sorry you're a turtle.
- Tortoise.

06:56.798 --> 06:59.565
They're known for their
serenity and steadfastness,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.734
and they've become
a symbol of wisdom.

07:01.769 --> 07:06.934
Wow! I underestimated Ma.
I just thought they were ugly.

07:07.008 --> 07:08.140
What do we got here?

07:08.176 --> 07:12.211
Well, not only is there an
Atlanto-Occipital dislocation,

07:12.246 --> 07:15.080
but there's significant damage
to C-3 and C-4.

07:15.116 --> 07:17.082
Which would take
a tremendous force.

07:17.118 --> 07:19.285
And an object at least 10 inches wide.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.920
So it seems unlikely that this happened

07:20.955 --> 07:22.555
while he was handcuffed
to the bed.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.056
So someone placed him on the bed

07:24.091 --> 07:27.226
to make it look like
a sex game gone wrong.

07:27.261 --> 07:31.754
- What's he weigh? About 250?
- Close. 117,196 kilograms.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.235
- 258 pounds, 6 ounces.
- Thank you.

07:36.270 --> 07:37.570
There's something else.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.808
Subcutaneous hemorrhaging
to the right thenar muscle.

07:42.844 --> 07:44.977
So he hit something or someone.

07:45.012 --> 07:47.680
All right. Thanks.

07:48.649 --> 07:49.715
Hey.

07:50.885 --> 07:53.752
Think you ever would've run out of
crazy medical terms to say to me?

07:53.788 --> 07:57.022
Would you let the door hit
you in the face as you entered?

07:59.727 --> 08:01.694
Of course not.

08:11.718 --> 08:13.518
Okay, let's do this.

08:17.991 --> 08:21.325
Okay.

08:21.361 --> 08:22.527
Cue, Nina.

08:24.564 --> 08:27.331
I came here from Chicago
and didn't know anyone.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.534
I didn't really want to know anyone.

08:29.569 --> 08:36.173
But you were kind,
patient, funny.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.442
<i>I was so worried about
being the newcomer,</i>

08:38.477 --> 08:40.077
<i>and from the first moment,</i>

08:40.113 --> 08:43.981
<i>you all treated me
like you've known me forever.</i>

08:44.017 --> 08:47.552
<i>And I hope we'll be a part of
each other's lives forever.</i>

08:50.189 --> 08:53.257
Because that's a lot better
than saying goodbye.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.302
That's beautiful.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.200
All right. Thanks.

09:03.236 --> 09:05.136
Yep. Okay.

09:07.206 --> 09:10.174
You gotta do that today?
You got like a month left.

09:10.209 --> 09:13.811
I've got 15 unused sick
days and two weeks vacation.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.374
- Really?
- Yeah. You probably have much more.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.716
- Have you checked?
- No.

09:18.751 --> 09:20.851
What? You assume you're
gonna die with it all unused?

09:20.887 --> 09:23.788
Yes, sitting right here
at this desk,

09:23.823 --> 09:26.757
surrounded by
42 empty cups of coffee.

09:26.793 --> 09:27.992
Pretty picture.

09:28.027 --> 09:31.562
- So you're done today?!
- Today.

09:33.232 --> 09:36.000
- This what you had in mind?
- Perfect. Thanks.

09:41.374 --> 09:45.543
- I hate this!
- And something for you.

09:46.312 --> 09:47.712
Robert Riley was a plumber.

09:47.747 --> 09:50.281
Had his own small,
one-man operation.

09:50.316 --> 09:54.885
And no criminal record,
no restraining order, no lawsuits.

09:54.921 --> 09:57.154
- Money problems?
- His credit report is clean,

09:57.190 --> 09:59.857
- and his business is solvent.
- Any trace of the wife?

09:59.892 --> 10:02.460
Got no hit on the BOLO,
checked the airlines

10:02.495 --> 10:04.962
and ran the name Elaine Chan
through ICE... nothing.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.731
<i>She has no credit cards,
bank accounts,</i>

10:06.766 --> 10:08.666
- and no driver's license.
- It's like she didn't exist,

10:08.701 --> 10:09.867
except for being married to Robert.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.736
Well, we know she exists.
The neighbors saw her.

10:11.771 --> 10:14.705
- Well, I'll keep digging.
- Okay, thanks.

10:14.741 --> 10:17.307
I'm gonna take a load of
this stuff down to my car.

10:20.179 --> 10:21.312
I'll give you a hand.

10:29.188 --> 10:30.087
Hi, babe.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.623
What are you doing here?

10:32.659 --> 10:35.226
Well, I knew you were doing
all this yourself,

10:35.261 --> 10:38.829
- so I, took the day off to help.
- Best boyfriend ever!

10:40.500 --> 10:43.201
So, Jane and Maura still don't know

10:43.202 --> 10:44.502
- this party's for them, too?
- Nope!

10:44.537 --> 10:47.105
They're completely in the dark.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.040
You know, you never really,

10:49.075 --> 10:52.777
told me how you feel
about everyone leaving.

10:52.812 --> 10:56.247
- I don't know.
- Sometimes it helps to talk about things.

10:58.251 --> 11:01.486
Did I ever tell you
that I used to force Jane

11:01.487 --> 11:03.320
to come to Sunday dinner?

11:03.356 --> 11:08.526
I insisted,
no matter how busy she was.

11:08.561 --> 11:09.960
But after a while,

11:09.996 --> 11:13.130
she and Frankie
used to come every Sunday,

11:13.166 --> 11:16.600
hungry for lasagna.

11:16.636 --> 11:18.002
And then Maura joined,

11:18.037 --> 11:20.938
and sometimes Korsak and Kiki,

11:20.973 --> 11:23.607
and now Nina.

11:25.511 --> 11:30.848
<i>It's my gang.
It's my normal.</i>

11:31.384 --> 11:35.286
I...
I just don't know

11:35.321 --> 11:37.221
if my lasagna will taste the same

11:37.256 --> 11:40.891
without everybody at the table.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.495
What are you doing?

11:44.530 --> 11:46.197
- What?!
- Kent told me that

11:46.232 --> 11:49.400
- you weren't cooperating with the video.
- I was totally cooperating!

11:49.435 --> 11:51.502
Too late.
It's already gone.

11:51.537 --> 11:54.505
You are the worst
boyfriend ever.

11:54.540 --> 11:57.141
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.909
And that was lovely.

11:59.512 --> 12:01.712
And I really did come to help,
so tell me what I can do.

12:04.217 --> 12:10.020
I do have one thing you
can help me with. This way.

12:11.891 --> 12:14.058
- You rang?
- Yes.

12:14.093 --> 12:16.660
- Did you find Elaine Chan?
- Not yet,

12:16.696 --> 12:18.662
but I did locate Robert's mother
in Florida.

12:18.698 --> 12:21.866
- She only met Elaine on Skype.
- Okay.

12:22.135 --> 12:22.867
<i>Is this on?</i>

12:22.902 --> 12:26.570
- God!
- Hi, Angela.

12:26.606 --> 12:29.673
<i>Hi. I did it!</i>

12:29.709 --> 12:32.243
- Yay.
- We're teaching her how to Skype.

12:32.278 --> 12:33.277
Who's "we"?

12:33.312 --> 12:34.578
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

12:34.614 --> 12:38.916
Hey, Ron.
Look. You two look so cute.

12:38.951 --> 12:40.351
<i>Your idea?</i>

12:40.386 --> 12:42.453
<i>What happened?
I can't see her anymore.</i>

12:42.488 --> 12:44.722
- I'm here.
- Hi.

12:44.757 --> 12:46.257
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.725
<i>This is fun!</i>

12:47.760 --> 12:50.728
<i>I mean, I'm gonna be able
to talk to you every day,</i>

12:50.763 --> 12:52.930
<i>and see you every day!</i>

12:52.965 --> 12:55.533
<i>And you know what?
I could watch you teach.</i>

12:55.568 --> 13:00.571
Yeah, that is great.
I'm sure the recruits will love that.

13:00.606 --> 13:02.406
You know what?
Hey, let's, um...

13:02.441 --> 13:03.941
let's practice something else.

13:03.976 --> 13:06.977
You see the...
the top row of keys there?

13:07.013 --> 13:10.047
- Yeah.
- Okay, find F-10.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.483
<i>Honey, they all say F-something.</i>

13:12.518 --> 13:14.752
<i>Okay. I found it.</i>

13:14.787 --> 13:17.421
Okay.
Go ahead and press that.

13:18.925 --> 13:24.895
- We will talk about this later.
- Sorry.

13:24.931 --> 13:27.097
So good.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.846
Hey. What's up?

13:38.881 --> 13:41.515
You working for
a moving company now?

13:41.551 --> 13:43.684
Got a contact in the mailroom.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.087
Yeah? Did she teach you
how to Skype yet?

13:46.122 --> 13:48.823
Your mother's gonna show me.

13:48.858 --> 13:52.126
- Look what we found.
- Elaine Chan looks to be married

13:52.161 --> 13:54.128
to at least two other men
in Massachusetts.

13:54.163 --> 13:57.365
- Elaine's a bigamist?
- Or Elaine Chan's a phony name.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.734
Also, about a month
before they were married,

13:59.769 --> 14:03.004
Robert paid $5,000 to
Second Pleasure Enterprises.

14:03.039 --> 14:06.407
They're not a registered corporation
with the Secretary of State's Office,

14:06.442 --> 14:08.009
<i>but they do have
a small web presence.</i>

14:08.044 --> 14:10.978
So, Robert dies handcuffed to
his bed in his red satin boxers,

14:11.014 --> 14:12.847
and now we find out
he gave 5 grand to this place?

14:12.882 --> 14:15.516
Second Pleasure could be
a cover for sex-trafficking.

14:15.551 --> 14:16.884
I'm gonna look into
these other marriages.

14:16.919 --> 14:18.486
And I'll call you
once I find an address

14:18.521 --> 14:20.521
- for Second Pleasure.
- Okay.

14:22.158 --> 14:25.192
And I will give you $1,000
if you will stop packing.

14:29.465 --> 14:33.501
I am lying, but it's worth it
to see you in the chair again.

14:38.074 --> 14:39.607
<i>Why can't I find
the cotton swabs</i>

14:39.642 --> 14:42.610
and the sterile water?

14:43.446 --> 14:46.313
Well, that's not where they go.

14:46.349 --> 14:49.316
Yeah, sorry,
I made a few changes.

14:49.352 --> 14:52.119
- Well, why would you make any changes?
- For my own ease?

14:52.155 --> 14:55.122
But rearranging things
before you went on vacation

14:55.158 --> 14:57.992
was insensitive.
I'm sorry, Maura.

14:58.027 --> 15:02.496
N-No. No, I'm the one that
should be sorry. I'm just...

15:02.532 --> 15:05.132
I just can't get used to the idea
that I'm taking a leave of absence,

15:05.168 --> 15:06.995
- even for a little while.
- Well, do you know what?

15:07.003 --> 15:09.603
I look forward to reading the book
that you'll write in this brief respite.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.444
- Ready to do your video now?
- No.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.196
You're very grumpy.

15:18.197 --> 15:20.481
- Did you know that?
- Still, no.

15:20.516 --> 15:22.783
- You got anything for me?
- Maybe.

15:22.819 --> 15:25.920
We found linseed oil and beeswax
on the victim's neck.

15:25.955 --> 15:27.555
Also, I'm doing additional tests

15:27.590 --> 15:29.790
to determine the origins
of both substances.

15:29.826 --> 15:31.826
We found two DNA profiles
inside the house...

15:31.861 --> 15:34.295
one from our victim,
the other from a female.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.163
Did you get a match in CODIS?

15:36.199 --> 15:37.631
No, but when you find the wife,

15:37.667 --> 15:39.767
we'll be able to tell if she
put the cuffs on her husband.

15:39.802 --> 15:41.869
- Great.
- What is it?

15:41.904 --> 15:44.939
Our only lead is
a strip club in Chinatown.

15:44.974 --> 15:48.309
- Nobody talks in strip clubs.
- So that means you're gonna have

15:48.344 --> 15:51.111
to go undercover as a... stripper?

15:51.547 --> 15:53.380
We've done worse.

15:53.416 --> 15:56.283
I'll get my tassels.

16:01.257 --> 16:03.657
Hey.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:03.693 --> 16:06.026
<i>I didn't actually think
you'd show up,</i>

16:06.062 --> 16:08.629
so I didn't leave the BPD until you
texted that you were actually here.

16:08.664 --> 16:10.197
Do you get punched a lot?

16:12.101 --> 16:13.701
Not as much as you'd think.

16:15.338 --> 16:17.471
Okay.

16:17.507 --> 16:19.240
I'm ready when you are.

16:22.678 --> 16:24.044
I hate endings.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.180
The truth is I hate beginnings, too.

16:26.215 --> 16:30.184
<i>I like middles,
the steady sameness,</i>

16:30.219 --> 16:33.521
<i>comfortable forever.</i>

16:33.556 --> 16:35.589
<i>But I guess I've been
doing this long enough</i>

16:35.625 --> 16:39.727
<i>to know you don't always get to
pick when life changes.</i>

16:39.762 --> 16:46.233
So... I know I have no choice
but to embrace this,

16:46.269 --> 16:47.442
and I'm gonna make it

16:47.443 --> 16:50.104
the best version of a next step
that I can.

16:53.409 --> 16:58.179
<i>I'm gonna miss you.
All of you.</i>

17:00.249 --> 17:03.551
<i>The bar is always open.</i>

17:03.586 --> 17:05.752
Korsak.

17:05.788 --> 17:09.089
Hard candy shell,
soft nougat center.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.090
For God's sake!

17:23.806 --> 17:25.806
<i>It's not your
grandfather's strip club,</i>

17:25.840 --> 17:28.375
- but it's still creepy.
- That it is.

17:29.445 --> 17:32.046
Good afternoon, sir.
My name is Josh Walker.

17:32.081 --> 17:33.647
I am the proprietor.

17:33.683 --> 17:36.717
Regretfully, you cannot have
your own lady friend in the club.

17:36.752 --> 17:39.153
I'm nobody's lady friend.
Boston Homicide.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.455
Yes, Detective, please.
Please, come on in.

17:41.490 --> 17:44.525
May I offer you something to drink,
or, a booth perhaps?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.961
We don't want any drinks,
we don't want a booth.

17:46.996 --> 17:48.862
<i>We just want some answers.</i>

17:48.898 --> 17:51.699
What do you have
going on here, Josh?

17:51.734 --> 17:55.069
This is a social club, a place
for middle-aged men, to meet women

17:55.104 --> 17:56.537
without the stress
of traditional dating.

17:56.572 --> 17:58.639
This is a legitimate business,
Detective.

17:58.674 --> 18:01.508
I'm a very successful matchmaker.

18:03.145 --> 18:04.878
Really?

18:04.914 --> 18:06.981
'Cause to me,
it looks like you're a pimp.

18:13.746 --> 18:15.546
I swear, officers, that...
that's all I do.

18:15.581 --> 18:16.947
I...
I introduce decent men

18:16.982 --> 18:20.384
to recently-arrived to this country,
but equally decent women.

18:20.419 --> 18:22.586
5 grand for an introduction
seems a little steep.

18:22.621 --> 18:25.455
- That... That's a membership fee.
- He a member?

18:26.158 --> 18:27.791
<i>Robert, yes, yes.
Just got married.</i>

18:27.827 --> 18:29.293
Very happy.

18:29.328 --> 18:32.563
Well, he was until somebody
broke his neck and killed him.

18:32.598 --> 18:34.498
My.
Who would do that?

18:34.533 --> 18:37.501
- Maybe you.
- Me? N-No, no, no.

18:37.536 --> 18:39.770
I haven't even talked to him
since this engagement.

18:39.805 --> 18:42.673
Besides, that man could eat me
for breakfast.

18:42.708 --> 18:45.175
Okay, let's say we buy that.
Elaine is missing.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.910
Do you have any idea why
or where she might be?

18:46.946 --> 18:50.180
You know, I always say,
"Love is so hard to facilitate."

18:50.216 --> 18:52.400
Which means these women
don't have valid

18:52.401 --> 18:54.484
- immigration status?
- N-N-No, they do.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.019
Ev-Every woman here is fine.
They're fine.

18:56.055 --> 18:58.556
We can take you downtown
and put a big sign on the door

18:58.557 --> 19:01.110
that says, "Closed."

19:02.661 --> 19:04.194
Her... Her real name
isn't Elaine. It's Wei.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.331
I-I put Robert and Wei
in touch with the real Elaine.

19:07.366 --> 19:10.534
- Wei have a last name?
- Wei Chan.

19:10.569 --> 19:14.204
Well, maybe she has a file.
Maybe Elaine has a file.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.875
- Maybe you get up and go get them.
- Okay.

19:22.715 --> 19:25.015
You think Wei ran
because she killed Robert?

19:25.050 --> 19:28.125
Even if somebody else killed him,
maybe she ran

19:28.160 --> 19:30.620
'cause she didn't
want to get shipped home.

19:31.991 --> 19:33.990
Love only goes so far.

19:36.061 --> 19:39.696
- 39C, press this button...
- Kent.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.064
Okay, I only have a few minutes.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.001
All right.
Um, I'm just about ready.

19:44.036 --> 19:46.703
Hey, did you get rid of
the stuff with me and Nina?

19:46.739 --> 19:49.306
No, I... I haven't done it yet,
but I promise I will.

19:49.341 --> 19:51.842
It's just, I've got some...
some great footage

19:51.877 --> 19:54.478
- just before your, your big reveal.
- Yeah?

19:54.513 --> 19:56.246
Well, I'm worried that
if I erase your stuff,

19:56.282 --> 19:58.916
- I'm going to erase that, too.
- Okay.

20:00.019 --> 20:01.652
Hey. Look, it's ready...
the camera.

20:01.687 --> 20:04.288
All right.

20:05.524 --> 20:09.426
Hey, let me just get
a little bit of focus here.

20:10.896 --> 20:14.164
Okay...

20:14.199 --> 20:16.133
I know this isn't goodbye.

20:16.168 --> 20:19.436
I mean, we're family, all of us.

20:19.471 --> 20:24.174
And sure, I'm gonna miss
seeing you guys every day,

20:24.209 --> 20:31.949
<i>but mainly...
I'm filled with a sense of gratitude.</i>

20:31.984 --> 20:34.918
<i>You've helped me to be a better man
and a better cop.</i>

20:34.954 --> 20:38.822
<i>I'm gonna hold down the fort here.</i>

20:38.857 --> 20:41.291
<i>And I think...</i>

20:41.327 --> 20:46.730
<i>No, I... I know
that I'm gonna make you proud.</i>

20:53.906 --> 20:55.706
<i>Yes, she's my niece.</i>

20:55.741 --> 20:58.608
- You know where she is?
- She returned to China.

20:58.644 --> 21:01.478
- Really? When?
- Last night.

21:01.513 --> 21:04.181
- You know why?
- She would be sent home anyway.

21:04.216 --> 21:07.551
- This seemed easier.
- Did she kill him?

21:08.854 --> 21:12.222
Yes. But it was an accident.

21:12.257 --> 21:13.557
We're gonna need
the whole story.

21:18.497 --> 21:21.732
Robert was a good husband
at first.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.467
But I think he began to believe

21:23.502 --> 21:26.670
- that Wei was using him for paper.
- You can't get papers

21:26.705 --> 21:28.505
if you get married
using someone else's name.

21:28.540 --> 21:32.476
Yes, but Robert stopped
caring about the truth of this.

21:32.511 --> 21:34.478
He just wanted to control her.

21:34.513 --> 21:38.448
He wouldn't let her talk to anyone
or visit me anymore.

21:38.484 --> 21:40.917
He locked her in the house.
He beat her.

21:40.953 --> 21:44.688
- Do you have proof of that?
- She went to the hospital twice.

21:44.723 --> 21:48.059
- She had to lie about why.
- How do you know she's gone?

21:49.228 --> 21:51.294
I gave her the money
for an airplane ticket.

21:51.330 --> 21:53.930
Do you know you could be arrested
for helping a killer evade justice?

21:53.966 --> 21:56.199
She... She was just
defending herself.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.802
We're gonna need you to stay put.

21:58.837 --> 22:00.170
We're gonna put you
on a no-fly list

22:00.205 --> 22:02.005
until we're done
with our investigation.

22:07.479 --> 22:10.547
- She's lying.
- Yeah, but about which part?

22:10.582 --> 22:12.649
The leaving?
The killing?

22:14.887 --> 22:16.733
The leaving. Frankie!

22:18.991 --> 22:20.323
Hey! Out of the way!

22:30.002 --> 22:32.035
- Get out of the car!
- Show us your hands!

22:36.208 --> 22:40.077
Out of the car.
Out of the car!

22:40.112 --> 22:42.145
<i>Face the glass.</i>

22:44.116 --> 22:47.172
The chasing...
not gonna miss so much.

22:53.392 --> 22:54.558
<i>Has Jane done her video yet?</i>

22:54.593 --> 22:56.426
No.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.494
Well, maybe I'll wait for her

22:57.529 --> 22:59.029
and just see what kind
of a tone she strikes.

22:59.064 --> 23:01.832
I'm guessing aggressive
and sarcastic.

23:01.867 --> 23:03.366
<i>Probably not your style.</i>

23:03.402 --> 23:05.402
I just don't know what to say!

23:05.437 --> 23:08.572
If it was me, I'd be like,
"Hey, Mom. I miss you.

23:08.607 --> 23:12.776
Russell, good luck with the baby.
Scotland, the brave."

23:12.811 --> 23:14.744
But that makes no sense
in this context.

23:14.780 --> 23:18.381
But it's what's in my heart.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.717
And you should say
what's in yours.

23:25.023 --> 23:26.356
Okay.

23:30.129 --> 23:32.963
<i>When I started this job,</i>

23:32.998 --> 23:34.564
<i>I thought it would be gratifying</i>

23:34.600 --> 23:40.270
<i>to help victims of homicide
through my forensic work,</i>

23:40.305 --> 23:43.640
<i>which it has been,</i>

23:43.675 --> 23:45.442
<i>and also, so much more.</i>

23:47.813 --> 23:52.516
This adventure
has made me more alive.

23:54.853 --> 24:00.790
And you have been
the big family I never had.

24:00.826 --> 24:05.061
And you've brought so much
joy and laughter into my life.

24:05.097 --> 24:07.797
<i>And for this,
I will be forever grateful.</i>

24:14.907 --> 24:19.910
<i>And maybe, just this once,
on the record,</i>

24:19.945 --> 24:24.948
<i>I am willing to speculate this...</i>

24:24.983 --> 24:28.051
<i>I'll love you,
and I'll never forget you.</i>

24:36.395 --> 24:38.094
<i>How was that?</i>

24:38.130 --> 24:39.763
Good.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.093
I'm really sad.

24:47.959 --> 24:52.877
Mrs. Riley, let's go over this
one more time.

24:52.912 --> 24:57.314
- Tell me what happened.
- I'm so sorry.

24:57.350 --> 25:00.785
<i>So sorry.</i>

25:00.820 --> 25:03.087
<i>I understand.
I understand, but I just...</i>

25:06.626 --> 25:09.460
- What did the wife say?
- Same thing as her aunt.

25:09.495 --> 25:10.995
So the handcuffs weren't for sex?

25:11.030 --> 25:13.664
- He was holding her prisoner?
- Seems that way.

25:13.699 --> 25:15.900
That's a very tidy desk, Sergeant.

25:15.935 --> 25:18.803
- I hate it.
- But you're leaving, too.

25:18.838 --> 25:21.405
Yeah, but look at my desk.

25:24.610 --> 25:28.546
I'm so sick of goodbyes. Will you
please distract me with science?

25:28.581 --> 25:31.215
The linseed oil and the beeswax
on the back of Robert's neck

25:31.250 --> 25:34.385
are from car wax, the same kind
that was on Robert's car.

25:35.822 --> 25:38.055
- Car bumpers are flexible.
- Newer ones are, yeah.

25:38.090 --> 25:39.657
Could he have been hit by a car?

25:39.692 --> 25:42.993
There were no abrasions or bruising
to indicate that a car hit him.

25:43.029 --> 25:45.262
What if he hit the car?

25:45.298 --> 25:47.097
<i>You know, like,
if he was pushed and he fell,</i>

25:47.133 --> 25:48.332
would his own weight
decapitate him

25:48.367 --> 25:51.034
- when his head hit the bumper?
- That is possible.

25:51.737 --> 25:54.705
- How much does Wei Chan weigh?
- 110, soaking wet.

25:54.740 --> 25:58.342
This guy weighs, what,
258 and 6 ounces.

25:58.377 --> 26:00.161
Well, she's not strong
enough to kill him,

26:00.162 --> 26:01.946
- much less move him.
- Then why say she did?

26:03.816 --> 26:05.282
To protect somebody else.

26:05.318 --> 26:07.885
- She's not changing her story.
- She will.

26:08.754 --> 26:10.187
Now a good time?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.300
Sure.

26:28.608 --> 26:32.309
- You sure?
- Yeah.

26:44.123 --> 26:46.724
Congratulations, Frankie.

26:46.759 --> 26:49.493
- Frank.
- Thank you, Maura.

26:52.164 --> 26:53.964
Now what?

26:54.867 --> 26:57.001
Well, now we try and figure out
who Wei is protecting.

26:58.804 --> 27:01.205
Okay.
I'll get right on it.

27:16.255 --> 27:17.254
Thank you.

27:23.162 --> 27:24.661
Sweetheart?

27:26.265 --> 27:29.767
Is it possible you checked
"Bachelorette Party" on the form

27:29.802 --> 27:32.636
instead of "Bon-Voyage Party"?

27:32.672 --> 27:35.339
What? What do you mean?

27:37.243 --> 27:41.367
Shit!
I didn't order this.

27:41.514 --> 27:43.147
- I didn't order that.
- No?

27:43.182 --> 27:44.114
No, but I can fix it.

27:44.150 --> 27:47.051
I just need some cream of tartar,

27:47.086 --> 27:49.586
food coloring, and powdered sugar.

27:49.622 --> 27:50.888
- Stat.
- Yep.

27:50.923 --> 27:52.957
- In the kitchen.
- Okay.

28:09.175 --> 28:10.607
Right here, please.

28:14.914 --> 28:16.647
Dr. Drake, was Robert dead

28:16.682 --> 28:19.450
before or after
he was moved to the bed?

28:19.485 --> 28:21.652
Well, based on lividity, it was
clear he was moved afterwards.

28:21.687 --> 28:24.321
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

28:30.129 --> 28:31.495
<i>You told Detective Rizzoli</i>

28:31.530 --> 28:33.931
that you were alone in the house
when you killed Robert.

28:34.966 --> 28:39.737
- Yes.
- Go ahead and pick up that dummy

28:39.772 --> 28:42.940
and move it, there.

28:52.351 --> 28:54.518
We both know
you can't do that?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.424
I know that Robert was beating you.

29:00.459 --> 29:03.394
We went to some of
your local hospitals.

29:03.429 --> 29:05.729
We found some nurses who
remembered you being brought in

29:05.765 --> 29:08.599
with someone who looked
like... him.

29:14.106 --> 29:17.208
Okay.

29:17.943 --> 29:19.410
This is how this is gonna go.

29:19.445 --> 29:23.247
<i>We're gonna leave
and let you two talk.</i>

29:23.282 --> 29:25.549
You can stick to your stories

29:25.584 --> 29:28.218
and know that we will
figure out what happened,

29:28.254 --> 29:31.588
and then justice will take its course.

29:31.624 --> 29:35.592
Or you can tell us the truth.
If Robert was beating you,

29:35.628 --> 29:39.029
and you didn't
intentionally kill him,

29:39.065 --> 29:41.165
the choice seems pretty clear.

29:54.613 --> 29:57.548
<i>Hi.</i>

30:02.021 --> 30:04.021
Think they'll confess?

30:04.056 --> 30:07.291
- They will if they know
what's good for 'em. -.

30:11.063 --> 30:13.030
You solved a murder on
your last day on the job.

30:14.733 --> 30:16.399
Not bad.

30:19.205 --> 30:22.039
How come I don't feel better
about it?

30:32.952 --> 30:34.785
Hey, um...

30:43.329 --> 30:44.862
This...

30:47.366 --> 30:51.802
- This should stay here.
- Janey...

30:53.439 --> 30:56.106
- Why don't you take him?
- No, no, no.

30:56.142 --> 31:00.978
He...
He should stay here... with you.

31:01.013 --> 31:04.081
You know, he'd probably be
your partner by now, so...

31:05.284 --> 31:06.483
He should be...

31:06.519 --> 31:10.405
He should be here to look after you.

31:44.290 --> 31:46.223
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:46.258 --> 31:49.210
Wei Chan admitted
that her husband had been

31:49.211 --> 31:50.494
beating her for months.

31:50.529 --> 31:53.530
Well, the reports and x-rays
you gave me from the hospitals

31:53.566 --> 31:55.732
are consistent with abuse.

31:55.768 --> 31:58.835
Um, Steve was the neighbor
across the street,

31:58.871 --> 32:00.637
helped her start getting treatment,

32:00.673 --> 32:02.973
they fell in love,
decided to run away together.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.309
Robert came home early
and caught them packing the car.

32:05.344 --> 32:07.077
When he went after Steve,

32:07.112 --> 32:09.646
he slipped and hit his neck
on the bumper.

32:11.317 --> 32:15.652
Well...
it's my last case.

32:15.688 --> 32:20.591
Nobody goes to jail, two
people go to China, unless...

32:20.626 --> 32:21.725
Please!
Please, please, please.

32:22.928 --> 32:26.096
I would really love one more call
before my shift is over.

32:26.131 --> 32:28.232
You don't want it to end?

32:28.267 --> 32:31.435
No, I don't want to go to this
party Ma's throwing for us!

32:32.871 --> 32:35.672
You know, she thought she did
such a good job hiding it.

32:35.708 --> 32:38.408
She did. But I just
know her well enough to know

32:38.444 --> 32:41.821
that she can't resist
giving us a big sendoff.

32:45.217 --> 32:46.383
Well, that's it.

32:47.853 --> 32:50.354
My shift is officially over.

32:50.389 --> 32:53.991
- So it's really coming to an end.
- Yeah.

32:55.694 --> 32:57.494
We had some good times, though.

32:57.529 --> 32:59.363
- Hey.
- Look at that!

33:09.041 --> 33:12.976
No. Do you find it so hard
to imagine yourself living here.

33:17.049 --> 33:19.816
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

33:19.852 --> 33:21.652
Lemon water, please.

33:23.956 --> 33:25.455
Maura, stop it,

33:25.491 --> 33:27.424
or they're going to charge us
for the robes again.

33:29.762 --> 33:32.195
Do I look bad-ass?

33:32.231 --> 33:34.498
- Yeah, you look like a bad-ass.
- Okay.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.617
But I have a new apartment!

33:37.369 --> 33:41.305
- It's a turbo.
- Yeah, it is.

33:48.781 --> 33:52.015
No! No crying!
Come on.

33:52.051 --> 33:55.919
- Our locations are changing. That's it.
- I know.

33:55.954 --> 33:59.589
I'm gonna go get dressed
for this party.

33:59.625 --> 34:00.691
I'll see you there, okay?

34:00.726 --> 34:03.427
- Be right behind you.
- All right.

34:37.987 --> 34:39.253
See you at the party.

34:40.856 --> 34:43.757
You're not getting off that easily.

34:43.793 --> 34:45.359
There's no need.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.962
Yeah, you're totally right.

34:47.996 --> 34:53.199
It's just a distinguished
32-year career.

34:53.235 --> 34:56.603
By all means, let's let
it end with no comment.

34:56.639 --> 35:00.441
You're gonna make me cry.

35:00.476 --> 35:02.376
Welcome to the club.

35:08.184 --> 35:10.484
Victor-nine-eight-one.
Ocean-Frank.

35:11.721 --> 35:14.555
<i>Thank you for
your service, Sergeant Korsak.</i>

35:14.590 --> 35:15.756
<i>Job well done.</i>

35:38.180 --> 35:40.114
Yeah, I'll see you.

36:10.579 --> 36:13.514
Good.
I have something to show you.

36:13.549 --> 36:15.616
<i>Hi. I'm Jane.</i>

36:16.652 --> 36:19.019
- What are you doing?
- On this iPad,

36:19.055 --> 36:20.354
I have made a video
for tonight's party.

36:20.389 --> 36:25.059
I've left 40 seconds for you.
If you do not wish to make a video,

36:25.094 --> 36:28.262
then I'm going to fill those
40 seconds with "Sock Jane."

36:28.297 --> 36:30.731
I'm so upset
about the changes in my life

36:30.766 --> 36:33.067
- that instead of making a video...
- Fine, I'll do it.

36:35.938 --> 36:39.573
I am not going to miss you.

36:39.608 --> 36:43.711
I use anger to hide my emotions.
I love you, Kent.

36:43.746 --> 36:46.213
Stop it. Stop it.

36:47.383 --> 36:50.584
<i>I've been with this group
for a short time,</i>

36:50.619 --> 36:54.888
<i>and I am still struck by
how wonderful all of you are.</i>

36:54.924 --> 36:59.760
<i>I'm just so glad that
I married into this family.</i>

36:59.795 --> 37:02.096
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

37:04.533 --> 37:07.101
<i>You know we do have to tell
everyone we're engaged.</i>

37:07.136 --> 37:09.269
Excuse me. Sorry. Aah!
Hey!

37:09.305 --> 37:10.156
What?

37:15.611 --> 37:16.844
What?!

37:29.458 --> 37:30.758
Surprise.

37:30.793 --> 37:33.484
Yay!

37:40.369 --> 37:41.869
- Group hug.
- Yes.

37:41.904 --> 37:44.671
<i>- Group hug! Group hug!
- Yes!</i>

37:44.707 --> 37:46.306
<i>I don't want to make a video.</i>

37:46.342 --> 37:48.675
Shh, shh, shh, everybody.
Be quiet. Come on. Be quiet.

37:48.711 --> 37:51.111
<i>I don't wanna talk about
how I'm gonna miss everyone.</i>

37:51.147 --> 37:55.182
<i>I would like to pretend
that this long, beautiful dream</i>

37:55.217 --> 37:59.653
<i>is gonna go on forever, but...
nothing goes on forever.</i>

38:01.690 --> 38:03.624
<i>We've been through so much...</i>

38:03.659 --> 38:07.361
<i>good things, horrible things.</i>

38:09.632 --> 38:12.733
<i>I can't imagine
what life is gonna be like</i>

38:12.768 --> 38:16.670
<i>tomorrow, next week,
next year.</i>

38:19.942 --> 38:21.208
<i>Just say it.</i>

38:21.243 --> 38:22.810
What?

38:24.280 --> 38:27.281
<i>I'm gonna miss you...</i>

38:27.316 --> 38:29.550
<i>really, really miss you.</i>

38:32.955 --> 38:35.522
<i>Come on.</i>

38:39.695 --> 38:41.395
<i>And I love you.</i>

38:46.068 --> 38:51.071
<i>To have been here
with all of you...</i>

38:51.106 --> 38:54.274
<i>I think I might be
the luckiest person in the whole world.</i>

39:00.554 --> 39:03.350
Now, can I have a beer
and some penis cake?

39:08.891 --> 39:11.225
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

39:11.330 --> 39:15.332
<i>Power adapter, check.
American dollars, check.</i>

39:15.368 --> 39:20.170
- Euros, check.
- Maura, they have money... and ATMs.

39:20.206 --> 39:23.155
- Well, what if there's a power outage?
- Well, then...

39:23.190 --> 39:26.043
the power adapter
isn't gonna do you any good.

39:26.078 --> 39:28.979
- I set two alarms for tomorrow morning.
- You don't need to.

39:29.015 --> 39:31.415
My flight is at 8:00,
and I need to be at the airport.

39:31.450 --> 39:32.883
I told you I was gonna pick you up.

39:32.918 --> 39:36.920
No, we've talked about this.
It's... It's too emotional

39:36.956 --> 39:39.156
for me to say goodbye to you
at the airport.

39:40.426 --> 39:42.359
I know!

39:44.931 --> 39:46.429
What's that?

39:47.733 --> 39:49.933
You used your miles and
bought me a ticket to Paris.

39:49.969 --> 39:51.035
Thank you!

39:51.070 --> 39:53.504
- You're coming to Paris?
- Yes!

39:53.539 --> 39:54.838
<i>I checked with personnel.</i>

39:54.874 --> 39:58.309
I have eight weeks vacation,
four weeks sick time,

39:58.344 --> 40:01.245
and BPD only buys out eight weeks, so...

40:01.280 --> 40:03.947
- Well, what about the FBI?
- I called them,

40:03.983 --> 40:05.849
and I asked if I could show up later,

40:05.885 --> 40:09.119
- and they said "mais oui."
- You speak French?

40:09.155 --> 40:12.389
I know how to say, "mais oui."

40:12.425 --> 40:15.759
I can't believe it!

40:15.795 --> 40:19.330
We are going to have
a full month in France together!

40:19.365 --> 40:20.397
I know!

40:20.433 --> 40:23.200
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- I know!

40:24.970 --> 40:29.206
- You have to go home and pack.
- No, my leopard bag is ready.

40:29.241 --> 40:33.577
- One bag?
- Well, yeah. What?

40:33.612 --> 40:36.880
Jeans, sweatpants, T-shirts,
toothbrush.

40:36.916 --> 40:38.749
Okay, you can't walk around
the "City of Lights"

40:38.784 --> 40:40.384
in sweatpants and a T-shirt.

40:40.419 --> 40:42.619
- Watch me.
- It's all right...

40:42.655 --> 40:45.456
- I'll have to rework the itinerary.
- What? What?

40:45.491 --> 40:47.257
We're gonna drink a bunch of wine,

40:47.293 --> 40:49.293
eat some smelly cheese...

40:49.328 --> 40:52.463
...I'll follow you around,
and we look at old French things.

40:52.498 --> 40:55.366
- "Old French things?"
- And then drink more wine,

40:55.401 --> 40:58.659
and the book'll write itself.
I'm not worried about it.

41:00.473 --> 41:04.508
This is not how I pictured
the next chapter starting.

41:05.611 --> 41:07.577
Well, maybe that's the beauty of it.

41:11.183 --> 41:13.917
- Hey!
- I know!

41:13.953 --> 41:15.319
You should just wear that
the whole time.

41:15.354 --> 41:17.588
I can't breathe.

41:17.623 --> 41:19.423
