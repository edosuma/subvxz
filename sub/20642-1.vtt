01:21:05.095 --> 01:21:05.962
beautiful!

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.732
Wait. On my go.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:10.733
Indulge me.

01:21:11.602 --> 01:21:13.403
You owe me one dead brother.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:18.442
He died like a coward, begging.

01:21:19.142 --> 01:21:20.577
How dare you?

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:53.202
The remote access switch.

01:23:14.023 --> 01:23:15.325
What took you so long?

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.663
What happened?

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.000
You got shot.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.507
Badass.

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:11.113
You ready?

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.662
Yeah.

01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:26.997
I'm ready.
