00:00.130 --> 00:02.630
Previously on "Californication"...

00:02.640 --> 00:04.050
it's not a memoir.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.540
It's a written account of my
sexual relationship with you.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.520
Written by me as a fuckin' novel.

00:08.530 --> 00:12.040
Even I'm confused, and
i stole the damn thing.

00:12.730 --> 00:15.310
Holy guacamole!

00:15.340 --> 00:17.010
You hocked everything. Is that it?

00:17.020 --> 00:20.100
I need to fess up, okay?
It's part of the process.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.710
Are you ready to have
the time of your life?

00:22.740 --> 00:24.450
I'm king of fuck mountain!

00:24.460 --> 00:26.850
- I don't want to do any more porn.
- Really?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.840
You know, if I can't
actually be with you, charlie,

00:28.850 --> 00:34.020
I'd kind of like the last person
I had on-screen sex with to be you.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.750
- Who are you?
- Damien.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.040
Call me "he who will kill you
if you touch his daughter."

00:38.060 --> 00:40.710
- She's pretty awesome.
- She is.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.690
Hi, you don't know me. My name
is hank moody. I'm a writer.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.130
I want to ask you a question
about lew -- lew ashby.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.610
Get the pen.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.980
Oh, I hate when that happens.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.030
You're an asshole!

00:53.060 --> 00:54.370
But we haven't even dated.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.780
Just in time.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.250
So, lew, it's been real.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.020
Yikes. We're gonna shake hands?

01:00.030 --> 01:01.710
Yes, we are.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.610
What the fuck?

01:03.630 --> 01:05.680
Life's just too fucking
boring not to try.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.690
Hey, you know, he throws
these, uh, huge parties.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.390
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Guest of honor never shows.

01:19.950 --> 01:24.360
Wakey, wakey... eggs and bakey.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.190
Come on! Wake up! We got to
get the kids to school already!

01:30.200 --> 01:34.480
Oh, christ, mia. What are
you -- what are you doing?

01:34.490 --> 01:35.920
Did you fondle me?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.550
I don't know. Do you feel fondled?

01:37.560 --> 01:42.010
I do a little bit. Get off. It's
way too early for your shenanigans.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.670
But not for this --
our review in the times.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.620
I had to go all the way to one of
those old-man newsstands to get it.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.230
Why do they still have those, anyway?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.330
What, old men or newsstands?

01:51.350 --> 01:52.600
Let's read it together.

01:52.610 --> 01:55.190
No, thank you. I don't
want to hear that shit.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.290
Of course you want to hear that shit.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.640
Do you know how long it's been since
you've actually had something published?

01:59.660 --> 02:00.910
All right. Here it goes.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.070
"At 17, mia cross has
everything most girls want."

02:04.090 --> 02:05.840
Stop. I told you I
didn't want to hear it.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.580
Now, what are you
even doing here anyway?

02:07.610 --> 02:10.710
I thought lew gave you... the speech.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.250
The one about how special I am
and how we'll always be friends?

02:13.260 --> 02:14.590
Yes, that one.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.560
He did. And I pretended to be sad.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.020
He let me have my book
party here this afternoon.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.460
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

02:21.470 --> 02:23.700
Holy shit, shit, shit!

02:23.710 --> 02:28.950
"A strangely poignant coming-of-age story "written
with the self-assurance of a much older writer.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.810
"In the end, the book's true
subject "isn't sex but loneliness.

02:32.840 --> 02:37.090
"It's hauntingly, hopelessly romantic
in the best sense of the word."

02:37.120 --> 02:38.950
That's good, right?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.420
Well, I'll be dipped in dog shit.

03:31.650 --> 03:34.050
Christ, this may be the best
review you've ever gotten.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.860
You're not helping.

03:35.870 --> 03:37.390
What do you want me to do,

03:37.410 --> 03:41.130
have it laminated so you can carry it around in
your wallet for the rest of your natural-born days?

03:41.150 --> 03:43.130
Have you seen your old assistant?

03:43.160 --> 03:44.840
She can go fuck herself.

03:44.860 --> 03:48.380
Not all women are like that,
you know -- conniving, vicious...

03:48.410 --> 03:51.040
willing to walk all over a
man to get what they want.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.380
I forget. Is that one of the
things you guys did together?

03:54.680 --> 03:55.970
Take daisy, for instance.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.710
Oh, jesus, not this shit again.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.460
Yes, this again.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.560
Tell you, man, being with her just -- it reminds me
of everything that's simple and good in the world.

04:04.580 --> 04:07.950
- She's not returning your phone calls, shit for brains.
- Because she's got too much integrity.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.890
Okay.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.400
She knows marcy's home from rehab.

04:10.430 --> 04:12.870
She thinks we should cool
it... Take a breather.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.230
Integrity -- that's a
fine quality in a mistress.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.420
Be careful.

04:17.430 --> 04:21.829
What, I shouldn't say anything bad about her because
next year we might all be sitting down to seder with her?

04:21.860 --> 04:25.560
Not on my watch, runkle. You don't abandon
a woman who stood by you thick and thin,

04:25.570 --> 04:27.650
20 years, the minute
she gets out of rehab.

04:27.690 --> 04:29.230
No, you wait 90 days.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.470
I looked that shit up.
That's the decent thing to do.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.520
Oh, I know.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.950
The marce.

04:36.980 --> 04:40.230
This place is so different in the
light of day -- not so ominous.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.210
Hey, so what'd you think of the reading?

04:42.230 --> 04:45.390
Honestly, I could not be more surprised.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.700
I know. Who knew the
little vixen could write?

04:49.430 --> 04:52.580
So, what surprised you was
the basic goodness of it?

04:52.590 --> 04:56.080
Well, I haven't read the whole book.
I mean, I just read the passage, so...

04:56.090 --> 05:00.000
so good, not excellent?

05:01.500 --> 05:03.420
We have a question.

05:03.430 --> 05:04.310
Fire away.

05:04.330 --> 05:07.490
- Mom says we're not old enough to stay for the party.
- Right.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.600
What do you think?

05:08.610 --> 05:11.910
Oh, so it's a trick question,
bit of a hand grenade.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.980
I'd kind of like to meet lew ashby.

05:13.990 --> 05:17.130
Really? Here's a tip -- don't
give him one of your demos.

05:17.140 --> 05:21.170
Come on, mom. Where's the
trust? Let us live a little.

05:21.180 --> 05:24.910
There's a rumor afloat that
roger daltrey might show.

05:24.920 --> 05:29.960
Okay, we'll stay for a little
bit, just a little while, okay?

05:31.980 --> 05:36.200
All right. Have fun, children.
Long live rock 'n' roll.

05:37.110 --> 05:43.080
I think that was a -- that was
a good decision. Solid parenting.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.650
Club soda with a twist.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.790
Alcohol is still okay for me, right?

05:54.810 --> 05:55.990
You do what you have to do.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.340
People who live in fear need
to be chemically altered.

05:58.350 --> 06:00.770
Okay. So what am i so afraid of, then?

06:00.780 --> 06:01.890
How the fuck should I know?

06:01.900 --> 06:06.860
But you've been scarfing those things like
the stress-eater mama runkle raised you to be.

06:06.870 --> 06:10.460
Hey, there's dani. I need to
talk to her. She's on my list.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.770
No, no. No fucking way, okay?

06:12.780 --> 06:15.830
Her we do not forgive, nor
do we ask her forgiveness.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.440
You can't tell me who I can
and cannot make amends to.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.960
Yes. Yes, I can.

06:19.970 --> 06:22.950
We, as a family, do not forgive her.

06:22.970 --> 06:25.270
All the bad shit that's
happened to us -- she started it.

06:25.290 --> 06:28.360
She's the cause of it.
She's the outbreak monkey.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.870
Did you see that girl with the
spicy shrimp rolls go through there?

06:30.890 --> 06:34.500
Okay, okay. Upstairs, people.
You just do the drugs upstairs.

06:34.510 --> 06:36.630
For fuck's sake, there's
children present, okay?

06:36.650 --> 06:40.110
- So just move it on up, okay? Just move it on up.
- Mother mary.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.050
That wouldn't happen to
be cocaine there, would it?

06:43.060 --> 06:45.040
Cocaine, meth. I think this is heroin.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.770
Some people really
have problems, you know?

06:47.790 --> 06:51.160
I had to remortgage our house
in order to send her to passages.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.020
You know what I'm saying?

06:52.030 --> 06:53.370
Hey, next time let me
know. I know people.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.010
I can hook you up,
arrange a little discount.

06:56.030 --> 06:57.080
"Next time"?

06:57.090 --> 06:58.880
Yeah, there's always a next time.

06:58.890 --> 07:02.020
You keep working those steps, baby girl.

07:02.040 --> 07:08.220
Got a little something that david crosby once
told me -- a little pot -- it's not cheating, huh?

07:08.780 --> 07:12.440
I deeply and profoundly love myself.

07:12.460 --> 07:16.230
I deeply and profoundly love myself.

07:16.570 --> 07:20.530
Hey, there he is -- not so fast, you.
Look who's here. It's annika staley.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.180
From rolling stone magazine.
Hello. Pleasure to see you again.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.970
How are the toe cramps?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.110
Annika has an interesting little theory about
the book that she's been sharing with us.

07:30.130 --> 07:32.700
A literary theory?
None for me, thank you.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.440
Well, I was just saying
how, when I reread the book,

07:35.480 --> 07:40.580
it just became completely obvious to me
that your fingerprints are all over it.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.900
My -- my fingerints? My -- my
stylistic fingerprints, my style.

07:43.910 --> 07:46.720
No, come on. Her style's
much more fluid than yours.

07:46.730 --> 07:50.670
I mean -- I mean you --
your personality, your, uh --

07:50.680 --> 07:53.430
your tics, that sense of
humor of yours, you know.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.860
Come on. It's you, isn't it?

07:54.870 --> 07:56.030
Excuse me?

07:56.060 --> 07:58.410
The guy in the book. It's a memoir.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.540
It's obviously based
on some real person.

08:00.570 --> 08:04.280
I-I-I see no reason to assume
something like that nowadays, you know.

08:04.310 --> 08:07.400
How about -- how about all these
people passing off their novels

08:07.440 --> 08:10.380
as true stories just because nobody
gives a fuck about fiction anymore?

08:10.400 --> 08:11.400
I find that fascinating.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.950
- Yeah, that's totally
boring.But -- - Not to me.

08:13.960 --> 08:19.730
but a sexy older man who seduces a
teenage girl, not knowing she's a teenager.

08:20.470 --> 08:23.820
Is that what this thing's
about? I got to get me a copy.

08:23.830 --> 08:29.330
Come on. Admit it. You guys obviously
had some kind of A... relationship, right?

08:31.480 --> 08:33.370
Annika, I think you're working
a little too hard tonight.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.049
How about we go meet zakk wylde?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.990
Who's zakk wylde?

08:38.010 --> 08:41.830
Excuse us. I have to throw this
chick out of my party. Come on.

08:43.409 --> 08:45.910
What the fuck are you doing?
You think this is funny?

08:45.920 --> 08:50.750
Uh, so she maybe writes a
little blurb about us. So what?

08:50.760 --> 08:54.250
It's not like they're gonna make you
go live in france with roman polanski.

08:54.260 --> 08:58.860
It'll just be one of those hypothetical,
"guess which washed-up novelist?" Things.

08:58.870 --> 09:02.550
Yeah. I don't think karen is
ever gonna look at it that way.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.220
She'll get over it... eventually.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.490
And it could be great publicity
for your book about ashby.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.680
Look, mia, not everybody that picks
up a pen sweats blood for publicity.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.070
You've got to disabuse
annika of this perspective.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.700
She believes what she believes.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.770
And it's your own damn fault.

09:18.780 --> 09:22.070
You shouldn't have given her
such a mind-blowing orgasm.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.860
What? That's what this is
about -- I didn't call her back?

09:24.870 --> 09:26.450
There was no repeat performance?

09:26.470 --> 09:29.290
No. I mean that that's
what tipped her off.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.640
She said that the real-life fucking
seemed a lot like the fucking in the book.

09:32.660 --> 09:33.460
What?

09:33.480 --> 09:37.590
Minus the punching, of course, so you
may want to get some new moves now.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.900
If you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go enjoy my party.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.450
I think I may be over
my thing with older men.

09:47.660 --> 09:51.300
I mean, ever since I started
meditating -- don't say anything --

09:51.340 --> 09:52.050
oh, my god.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.630
I'm more in touch with the
emotions of the people around me.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.980
I'm not so ego-focused.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.460
Well, you sound like -- well,
okay. That's good, sweetie.

10:00.470 --> 10:04.210
That's -- that's -- that's progress,
right? That's why you went there.

10:04.220 --> 10:09.880
Did hank say anything to you about charlie
getting up to any weird shit while I was away?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.690
No. What?

10:11.700 --> 10:16.090
Well, you know, he's stress-eating,

10:16.100 --> 10:19.500
and he's not pawing at me
or pressuring me for sex.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.650
Well, thank god,
right?I mean --

10:20.660 --> 10:24.340
well, he seems restless.

10:24.370 --> 10:27.630
Well, honey, what about you?

10:27.640 --> 10:30.570
I have inner peace, baby.
I see what's important.

10:30.580 --> 10:37.030
And by being loyal and faithful to charlie,
I attract that same shit back into my life.

10:37.060 --> 10:39.580
That's how the universe works.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.040
I'm very proud of you.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.610
- You like that?
- Yes, I do.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.390
- Oh, yeah, come on.
- It's progress.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.860
Hey, not that way. Come.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.220
Why? Are there drugs
that way? I'm strong.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.350
- I can handle it.
- No. I'm not strong.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.700
Come on, let's go.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.270
What? It's just lew ashby.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.550
Well, right. I don't want to,
like, fan the flames, you know.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.490
What? He burns for you? Shit.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.870
I missed a lot, didn't I?

11:02.890 --> 11:05.670
No, you did not. He -- he's
like a toddler, you know.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.210
He sees something shiny in his
midst, and he -- he kind of wants it.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.960
You are shiny. Of course he does.

11:14.690 --> 11:17.070
- Oh, my god.
- What?

11:17.080 --> 11:19.490
- Oh, my god! Look! Look, look, look!
- What?

11:19.500 --> 11:22.530
I've been trying to give them
space -- it's damien and becca.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.340
- Where?
- Right there!

11:23.350 --> 11:25.470
Not everyone is freakishly tall!

11:25.480 --> 11:28.790
Okay. Can you see? That's sweet, isn't ?

11:28.800 --> 11:31.870
- No?
- Not really so sweet, no.

11:31.880 --> 11:36.050
- Why not?
- Because isn't that the becca right there?

11:37.330 --> 11:41.980
- That would be.
- Oh, my god. Take it.

11:42.310 --> 11:48.620
Oh, hey, bec! Come
here. Oh, no. Oh, god.

11:48.630 --> 11:51.920
I'm the best me I can possible be.

11:52.250 --> 11:56.380
I'm the best me I can possible be.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.910
I tell you, I'm just
fresh out of answers.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.990
Maybe marcy's right, you know.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.440
Maybe we all just need to surrender
to some higher power, you know, just --

12:10.450 --> 12:12.730
just be clear and let go.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.920
Fuck that. You sound like julian.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.780
Well, maybe julian's on to something.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.500
Guy gets more pussy
than either one of us.

12:18.520 --> 12:22.220
Either one of us? Who are you fucking
besides your wife and a porn star?

12:22.650 --> 12:24.380
Mind if I join you guys?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.310
- Yes.
- No. No. Pull up a chair.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.060
You've always had a unique ability
to talk sense into this man.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.860
Don't mind if I do.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.200
So, what compromising position has
he gotten himself into this time?

12:35.210 --> 12:38.110
Well, it seems that his new career
in porn is not enough for him.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.840
He also has to marry the porn star,
save her from her road to ruin.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.030
Apparently he's never seen "star 80."

12:44.070 --> 12:46.170
- What about marcy?
- What about marcy?

12:46.180 --> 12:48.340
- Here's a thought.
- What about marcy?

12:48.350 --> 12:52.560
Maybe the two people in this conversation who
have never been married should shut the fuck up

12:52.570 --> 12:54.810
and not pass judgment
on the one who has.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.460
Here's a thought right back at you.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.040
Maybe marcy's not the problem.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.710
I never said she was.

12:59.740 --> 13:03.230
"Damn my coke addict of a wife," I've
heard you say on several occasions.

13:03.240 --> 13:08.910
Mm, it seems to me you've traveled a long road to
end up right back where you were nine months ago --

13:08.920 --> 13:14.080
enthralled to some much younger woman who allows
you to feel like you're completely in control --

13:14.090 --> 13:16.370
a master of the universe, if you will.

13:16.400 --> 13:20.310
Or in his case, a masturbator
of the universe, if you will.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.700
Who knows?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.880
Maybe it's your destiny, charlie runkle.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.370
- Maybe you were born to dominate...
- oh, no.

13:28.380 --> 13:34.600
In which case, my advice to you is embrace
it, be who you are, let your freak flag fly.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.860
Interesting.

13:36.870 --> 13:40.100
Becca, come on, sweetie.
Just let me in. Come on.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.920
What the hell? Somebody better
not be doing coke in there.

13:43.930 --> 13:46.720
- Oh, sorry. -
It's -- it's becca.

13:46.730 --> 13:47.410
Is she okay?

13:47.420 --> 13:52.520
She found that asshole boyfriend of
hers making out with another girl.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.230
Becca. It's lew ashby.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.620
Oh, well, that's just gonna do it.

14:01.630 --> 14:05.590
Becca, I know things are feeling
pretty shitty right now --

14:05.610 --> 14:07.110
crappy, whatever.

14:07.130 --> 14:11.960
But, uh, in two weeks, slipknot's at
the forum, and if you open up this door,

14:11.980 --> 14:15.960
let your mother in the bathroom,
you're there, backstage.

14:15.970 --> 14:17.490
You're at the freakin'
sound check, okay?

14:17.500 --> 14:22.550
You know what? That's really sweet,
but my daughter cannot be bribed.

14:23.670 --> 14:27.150
Not you... him.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.730
Okay.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.680
I'm really sorry. She's going
through some stuff, so...

14:36.990 --> 14:41.750
it's recently come to my attention
that men cannot be trusted.

14:41.770 --> 14:44.360
Truer words have never been spoken.

14:44.380 --> 14:50.070
Can you provide any assurance that you'll
follow through on this extravagant promise?

14:50.080 --> 14:54.250
Can you provide any assurance you're actually
gonna let your mother into the bathroom?

14:54.270 --> 14:55.610
No.

14:55.630 --> 15:00.270
So, I guess we have no choice
but to, uh, trust each other.

15:12.850 --> 15:15.860
Look.

15:15.870 --> 15:20.530
It's gonna take that dude 15 years
before he realizes what he's missing.

15:20.550 --> 15:25.850
He's missing a lot, 'cause
you're fucking magic.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.320
And if that's too long to wait,

15:27.350 --> 15:30.690
I can always get lemmy from motorhead to
cut off his cheeks with a straight razor.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.350
Totally up to you.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.390
Good?

15:41.840 --> 15:45.300
Shake it off, princess.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.570
She's all yours.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.990
Hey, you. What'd he say?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.080
I'll never tell.

16:08.940 --> 16:11.110
Come here.

16:17.650 --> 16:20.670
So, I guess I'm the
biggest loser of all time.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.850
Not even close.

16:22.860 --> 16:28.080
Trusting someone does not make you into
a loser, okay, 'cause you took a leap.

16:28.110 --> 16:29.590
Into a brick wall.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.320
And that's why it hurts so much.

16:32.330 --> 16:36.410
And all you can do is... let it hurt.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.870
Look who I found!

16:47.890 --> 16:49.640
- Daisy.
- Hi, baby.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.630
- Oh, so this is daisy.
- Yeah.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.090
Daisy, hank. Hank, daisy. You see that?

16:56.100 --> 16:58.650
Everybody really does
come to lew ashby'S.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.930
Have you seen the entire house,
all the nooks and crannies?

17:01.950 --> 17:03.920
- I could give you a guided tour.
- No, no, no.

17:03.930 --> 17:07.190
You're not squirreling her
away. No. I just found her.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.760
So, what's the haps?

17:08.770 --> 17:12.750
Oh, nothing much. Just
same old, same old.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.890
Next guided tour leaving in 30 seconds.
Come on, we can talk about your work.

17:15.900 --> 17:20.599
I'm not a big fan of porn myself, but I was
-- don't get me wrong -- in my formative years.

17:20.609 --> 17:23.230
Daisy, what? You came
here all alone? What?

17:23.240 --> 17:24.960
Oh, no, no, no. She came with ronny.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.099
Where the fuck did he just get off to?

17:27.109 --> 17:28.069
- Ronny!
- Ronny.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.810
Well, I'm not with ronny.
He was coming tonight.

17:31.820 --> 17:35.160
Thought it'd be fun to tag along,
so -- thought you guys might be here.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.910
I know lew ashby's
parties are really famous.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.770
Ronny!

17:38.790 --> 17:41.160
Oi, oi. How did I
know I'd find you here?

17:41.170 --> 17:42.330
Runkle, how you doing?

17:42.340 --> 17:46.900
Hank moody, ronny praeger, the very
gifted auteur behind "vaginatown."

17:46.920 --> 17:48.000
Oh, I'm honored. I'm a big fan.

17:48.010 --> 17:52.670
What is next for you, "a cock-work orange,"
or perhaps "2069: A sit-on-my-face odyssey"?

17:52.680 --> 17:54.270
That's actually not too fucking bad.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.080
We've actually been talking
about it, haven't we, sweet tits?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.770
We've decided on "network."

17:57.780 --> 17:59.100
Oh, "network."

17:59.110 --> 18:00.950
No. What are you
talking about -- daisy?

18:00.960 --> 18:04.120
She didn't tell you? Daisy
is getting out of porn.

18:04.130 --> 18:06.330
- You are?
- Daisy's ,re porn's over there.

18:06.340 --> 18:10.020
- Uh, you know, I'm giving it some thought.
- No.

18:10.030 --> 18:12.700
What kind of shit-for-brains
agent gave you that advice?

18:12.710 --> 18:13.880
That's terrible advice!

18:13.890 --> 18:17.600
I mean, seriously, when you've got 100%
usda choice beef like that slappin' about,

18:17.620 --> 18:20.380
you don't let it get to the freezer.

18:20.690 --> 18:22.280
Just back off, buddy, would you?

18:22.310 --> 18:23.860
Okay? The decision's been made.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.220
Daisy doesn't want to do any more porn.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.160
And maybe you should just get your paws
off her, you know, give her a little space.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.720
What the fuck do you
care where his paws are?

18:31.750 --> 18:34.990
I don't think a girl should be handled
like that against her will -- that's all.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.740
- It's fine.
- It's fine?

18:36.750 --> 18:39.310
It's fine he touches you? It's
fine you're out on a date with him?

18:39.320 --> 18:42.250
It's fine that -- that he's planning
the rest of your life for you?

18:42.280 --> 18:46.190
What? What? I mean, what about us?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.680
Excuse me?

18:47.720 --> 18:50.260
- Professionally speaking.
- Charlie, you look like you need a refill.

18:50.270 --> 18:51.250
- You look dry.
- I think I should go.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.220
oh, no, no, no, no! No.

18:54.230 --> 19:00.740
No one's going anywhe , not till this skinny
little porno ho tells me what he meant just now.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.420
Charlie?

19:02.430 --> 19:03.630
Okay, you know what? All right, fine.

19:03.640 --> 19:09.100
I'm sorry, marcy, you know, but after all the shit
we've been through, you know, pretending is pointless.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.000
This is too much fucking work.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.490
You know, it's too much
mess, too much craziness.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.680
I want to get a divorce.
I'm gonna be with daisy.

19:16.690 --> 19:20.360
There. I said it out
loud, can't take it back.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.050
You fucked my man.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.700
Marcy, I
-- marcy --

19:31.640 --> 19:34.590
- Ah, you bitch!
- Did you see that?

19:35.900 --> 19:37.760
You fucking whore!

19:38.600 --> 19:39.880
What are you doing, moody?

19:39.890 --> 19:41.290
You can't stop a girl fight.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.820
- You might accidentally hit one of them.
- Asshole.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.600
You just had to go there, didn't you?

19:51.830 --> 19:54.630
No, go ahead. You do the honors.

20:02.460 --> 20:07.130
What we have here is a
failure to communicate.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.130
Errol flynn used to
swing from that thing.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.860
What, no props for saving your life?

20:26.870 --> 20:28.290
Come on.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.500
Hey, lew. Great party.

20:31.510 --> 20:34.070
You taking off? The night is young.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.110
We'll talk.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.830
Bye, annika... staley.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.100
I used to know that girl.
What'd you do to her?

20:41.110 --> 20:45.940
I don't want to go into the exact details, but I
did solve that, uh, little problem you were having.

20:45.950 --> 20:47.920
You solved it just like that?

20:47.930 --> 20:49.560
Yes, I did.

20:49.600 --> 20:55.460
I told annika that I was the sexy
older man that mia's been banging --

20:55.470 --> 20:56.910
you know, the one from the book.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.180
Yeah, but you haven't
even read the book.

20:58.220 --> 21:02.320
That's what you take me for,
right, like a functional illiterate?

21:03.070 --> 21:05.740
I read the little fucker
-- not your best work.

21:05.770 --> 21:06.930
Not my best work?

21:06.970 --> 21:09.460
Girls talk a lot after sex. I
mean, don't get down on yourself.

21:09.470 --> 21:11.070
You hadn't written one for a while.

21:11.090 --> 21:13.220
I'm sure the next one's
gonna be a lot better.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.490
You have to squeeze one out of the
chamber, let the good stuff come through.

21:20.020 --> 21:24.100
Well, thank you, and... for the other.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.270
Whatever, you know?

21:26.290 --> 21:28.540
No offense, but I'm a much bigger story.

21:28.550 --> 21:33.970
"Crazy record producer lives alone in big, empty house
with a taste for underage women" -- writes itself.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.580
- It's not the real story, though.
- It's a story.

21:35.590 --> 21:39.880
It's a version of the truth
-- the extended dance mix.

21:40.230 --> 21:42.460
So, problem solved.

21:42.470 --> 21:46.940
Marcy's gonna come back with us, and I'm
gonna put all the alcohol under lock and key.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.110
Oh, that's --
that's good.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.920
Oh, no, I have a
bottle stashed --

21:50.930 --> 21:55.330
I know where all your
bottles are stashed. Yeah.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.750
Damn it.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.360
So, lew, it was a
truly disastrous party.

22:00.380 --> 22:03.160
- It was, wasn't it? Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:03.170 --> 22:06.230
- But you know what? I underestimated you.
- Me?

22:06.670 --> 22:11.640
In the heat of battle, you
shone through, your true colors.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.240
High praise.

22:16.250 --> 22:18.650
I better leave on that
note. Thanks for coming.

22:18.660 --> 22:21.110
Thanks for having me.

22:21.850 --> 22:25.040
See you.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.910
What was that all about?

22:27.920 --> 22:29.580
I'll never tell.

22:29.590 --> 22:31.120
More secrets, huh?

22:31.130 --> 22:33.320
I know. Well, you know,
it's such an effort.

22:33.330 --> 22:36.120
I have to retain my aura of mystery.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.680
It's no effort.

22:44.110 --> 22:46.880
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:59.970 --> 23:02.880
- Thought I'd be fashionably late.
- You came.

23:02.890 --> 23:06.840
- I was invited, right? - Yes, but
I-I never thought you'd actually show.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.710
Just wait right here.
Lew's, like, three feet away.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.150
No, no, no. Wait a minute. Lew?

23:10.160 --> 23:11.880
Yeah, lew.

23:11.900 --> 23:14.020
And what if I didn't come to see lew?

23:14.040 --> 23:16.200
Then you're not making any sense, woman.

23:16.210 --> 23:19.880
I can't lie, hank moody. I think
you stirred something up in me.

23:20.710 --> 23:23.180
Memories -- misty, watercolored
ones. Look around, lady.

23:23.190 --> 23:27.370
All this is for you -- all of it -- the
crazy fucking house, the party, everything.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.660
I already have a house.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.170
It's a totally soulless
one. This is a real house.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.490
It's old and broken and battered
'cause shit happens here -- real shit.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.780
Yeah. Looks like some
real shit happened here.

23:40.790 --> 23:44.940
Ah, ignore that. Things fall
apart. They break. That's life.

23:44.950 --> 23:49.060
Oh, I see. So, life has to
be sad and broken, haunted?

23:49.070 --> 23:50.450
Yes.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.540
I don't buy it.

23:52.550 --> 23:54.090
This place looks awful.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.320
It looks like somebody died here.

23:55.330 --> 24:00.060
Somebody almost did, but not
tonight. Just wait here. Stay put.

24:00.070 --> 24:03.340
Hey, lew! Lew!

24:08.950 --> 24:12.390
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

24:18.230 --> 24:20.460
yes?

24:21.730 --> 24:24.720
out. Everybody out,
please. Please. Thank you.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.830
Wait. What the fuck are you
doing? Don't go. Don't go.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.130
- What the f--
- she's here.

24:29.140 --> 24:31.760
- She who?
- "She who"? Janie, you asshole.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.690
She came.

24:33.700 --> 24:34.720
- No way.
- Yes way.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.710
Get your ass downstairs right now.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.400
No. I mean, ay w. No fucking
way I'm going down there.

24:39.410 --> 24:42.200
Did you not hear me?

24:42.210 --> 24:44.160
You -- you go
talk to her.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.620
You want me to talk to her?
What is this, fifth grade?

24:47.630 --> 24:52.260
Look, I can't, I mean, not after all this
time, after all the shit that I pulled.

24:52.290 --> 24:55.290
I-I don't know. According to
her, you're not such a bad boy.

24:55.300 --> 24:59.060
I mean, you know, you love music a
little too much, blah, blah, blah.

24:59.070 --> 25:02.420
She said that shit? I mean,
maybe she really does love me.

25:02.430 --> 25:03.080
Why?

25:03.090 --> 25:07.480
Because it's a big fucking lie because
I did all kinds of bad shit to her.

25:07.490 --> 25:10.370
I-I fucked around constantly.
I crashed a car into her house.

25:10.380 --> 25:15.610
I, you know, shit -- once I
even... made her get an abortion.

25:15.620 --> 25:16.850
You made her?

25:16.860 --> 25:19.080
Well, it's not like I
did it myself or anything.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.440
- It's just...
- what?

25:23.570 --> 25:26.780
I was kind of fucking this
other girl at the same time.

25:26.790 --> 25:29.040
- While she was pregnant?
- Sure.

25:29.050 --> 25:30.240
Only you didn't know that.

25:30.250 --> 25:33.680
No, I knew. I
just -- I was...

25:34.680 --> 25:35.970
scared shitless, s.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.910
- kind of like you are right now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.430
Sit down, ratso rizzo,
you're making me nervous.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.830
Come on. Have a seat.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.810
I'm only gonna say this once, so
I want you to listen, all right?

25:45.820 --> 25:51.830
No matter what you did,
don't give up. Do not give up.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.050
Why

25:53.060 --> 25:57.150
because if she loves
you, she'll forgive you.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.320
You really believe that?

25:58.330 --> 26:02.300
I have to. Otherwise there's no point.

26:02.730 --> 26:07.610
There is no life without love
-- none worth having, anyway.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.830
Fuck it. You're right.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.140
All right. I'm gonna do
this. It's gonna suck.

26:17.690 --> 26:18.980
How do I look?

26:18.990 --> 26:20.920
- Like a big douche bag...
- thank you.

26:20.930 --> 26:24.220
A very, very sexy douche bag.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.710
- Just let me grab my jacket.
- All right.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.130
- Fix my hair.
- There you go.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.320
- You got it.
- Hang on.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.680
What? You're gonna do that now?

26:39.780 --> 26:40.880
Okay, hurry up.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.990
Chill out. Do you want
-- do you want one?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.560
Just go ahead. You first.

26:48.030 --> 26:52.450
Come on. Come on.

26:54.730 --> 26:57.710
You good? Fortified?

26:58.030 --> 27:01.430
Let's go. Let's go.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.180
What?

27:06.710 --> 27:12.170
Lew. Lew! Lew! Shit. Lew.

27:12.180 --> 27:15.010
Where's your fucking pe

27:15.710 --> 27:18.640
I got it. I got it. I got it.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.740
There you go. That's good, right?

27:22.750 --> 27:27.200
lew! lew! Lew.

27:28.030 --> 27:31.640
Lew! Lew!
