WEBVTT

00:47.525 --> 00:51.355
It's hard not to feel a
little lost as we begin, but...

00:52.878 --> 00:55.707
...let's just
take it all in and...

00:57.100 --> 01:00.321
...see what we can find.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.323
Who knows?

01:02.366 --> 01:05.413
Maybe what can find <i>us.</i>

01:05.456 --> 01:08.372
No sooner than you say it.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.418
Well, it's Miss Marcy.

01:10.461 --> 01:13.508
Miss Marcy's a beautiful,
lush blackberry bush.

01:13.551 --> 01:17.729
we've come across a time
or two in our travels.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.819
What are you going to share
with us today, old friend?

01:20.863 --> 01:23.083
Juicy blackberry?

01:24.432 --> 01:25.433
Mmm.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.614
When's the last time
you heard someone say something

01:32.657 --> 01:35.660
that interesting?

01:35.704 --> 01:39.751
<i>And maybe Miss Marcy drops
some more berries</i>

01:39.795 --> 01:41.362
<i>in the little brook.</i>

01:41.405 --> 01:43.929
<i>Maybe these berries
will take route</i>

01:43.973 --> 01:47.803
<i>on the lake shore downstream</i>

01:47.846 --> 01:53.156
<i>and bring Miss Marcy children
in the years to come.</i>

01:53.200 --> 01:56.203
I don't even know
if that's how berries work,

01:56.246 --> 01:58.944
but it sure sounds nice.

01:58.988 --> 02:04.298
<i>I bet Miss Marcy would love
a special someone</i>

02:04.341 --> 02:07.257
<i>to spruce the place up a bit.</i>

02:08.389 --> 02:10.173
<i>What should we call him?</i>

02:11.740 --> 02:13.437
<i>Arthur.</i>

02:15.047 --> 02:17.572
<i>Arthur the evergreen.</i>

02:17.615 --> 02:20.836
I think mighty Mount Mansfield
would approve

02:20.879 --> 02:23.273
of a name like that,

02:23.317 --> 02:26.581
because there is nothing
like having the one

02:26.624 --> 02:31.934
you hold dearest nearest
when the world turns cold.

02:31.977 --> 02:35.329
That's the picture
we all want to paint.

02:35.372 --> 02:40.334
Thanks for going to a special
place with me, Carl Nargle.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.903
Cut.
And we're clear.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.603
Same time tomorrow?

02:48.646 --> 02:51.214
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.133
Yeah.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.005
That's it.

03:00.049 --> 03:04.271
<i>This is
"The World's Strongest Person."</i>

03:04.314 --> 03:07.187
Almost forgot
where I was for a second.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.623
Almost.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.278
Amazing.
No other word for it.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.280
Awesome and amazing.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.064
Have we never met Arthur before.

03:15.107 --> 03:17.632
There's been a pond
named Arthur but never a tree.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.547
- Never a tree?
- Yeah.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.288
Breaking new ground. Mwah.

03:21.331 --> 03:24.769
- Oh, I forgot the milk.
- Okay.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.858
- Does anything hurt?
- No, I'm good.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.425
- Cramped or something?
- No.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.427
And snow this time of year?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.690
- Oh.
- Incredible.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.605
I never know
where I'm going.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.261
You certainly got us there.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.045
So much moisture in the wind.

03:40.089 --> 03:44.311
Is it okay if I take Miss Marcy
and her friends to Vantastic?

03:44.354 --> 03:46.661
I think
they would appreciate that.

03:46.704 --> 03:50.186
There you go.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.753
They're so warm.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.190
Sorry just going to move in
right here.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.367
- Tony.
- Here's coffee-- with milk.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.069
Great.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.550
Tony. Tony.

04:06.594 --> 04:09.466
- Katherine.
- Oh, done. Done.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.121
And this is
"This Afternoon in Burlington."

04:12.164 --> 04:14.254
Ready. We're live.

04:14.297 --> 04:17.692
Welcome to
"This afternoon in Burlington."

04:17.735 --> 04:20.825
- And camera two.
- I'm your host...

04:20.869 --> 04:23.263
- And camera one.
- ...Donald Moore.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.439
- Stay on one. Stay on one.
- It's hard to look away.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.006
Yeah,
yet so many people do.

04:28.050 --> 04:31.793
Fox News is killing us.
Weather Channel.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.011
- TV Guide Channel.
- Hey, T.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.709
- Yeah?
- Keep the faith.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.973
The question is whether we want
the parade blocking access

04:38.016 --> 04:41.498
to local
cultural establishments.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.065
Dr. Bradford Lenihan?

04:43.108 --> 04:46.242
Curator of Burlington's
Museum of Art.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.723
<i>The</i> Burlington Museum of Art.

04:48.766 --> 04:52.509
If you're a true artist
living above Pittsfield

04:52.553 --> 04:55.686
and below St. Albans,
that's where your paintings are.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.340
- Yeah.
- Well, I know one artist

04:57.384 --> 04:59.908
who's got the most popular
painting show in Vermont,

04:59.951 --> 05:03.868
- and his name is Carl Nargle.
- Yeah.

05:03.912 --> 05:07.829
Thanks.
It's just... frustrating.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.527
I feel like sometimes
being the total package

05:10.571 --> 05:13.313
makes it hard for people
to see the gift inside.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.792
- We--
- Mnh-mnh.

05:14.836 --> 05:18.143
I-- I have an idea
that could change that.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.494
Come here.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.758
Our budget's been slashed,
and we need your help.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.761
Put me to work,
and I will sign tote bags

05:26.804 --> 05:30.025
until my fingers turn
a rich Parisian blue.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.376
Tote bags only take us so far.
We need rating ratings.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.292
Ratings only Carl Nargle
can deliver.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.470
So we're going to put you on
two hours a day,

05:40.514 --> 05:43.473
back to back,
one painting each hour.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.825
So people would have
a chance

05:47.869 --> 05:50.088
to see twice as much
of my artwork.

05:50.132 --> 05:53.091
It's, uh, Katherine's idea.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.266
Katherine's idea?

05:54.310 --> 05:55.703
Well,
she wants to make sure

05:55.746 --> 05:57.792
that, uh, the station
is in good shape...

05:57.835 --> 05:59.010
So do I.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.317
...so she can leave.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.979
Of course,
as a real artist,

06:11.022 --> 06:15.113
If I start cranking out
255 more paintings a year,

06:15.157 --> 06:16.637
people could think, you know,

06:16.680 --> 06:19.379
that each painting
isn't precious to me, and...

06:24.296 --> 06:26.429
And I can't take that risk.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.434
- We'll make do.
- Sure.

06:31.478 --> 06:35.482
But just let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.266

with probably the most
impressive shaft of lumber

<i>that Mount Mansfield

Thank you for going to
a special place with me,

10:58.962 --> 11:01.008
Carl Nargle.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.793
- Cut it.
- That tree is probably too tall.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.361
Brace yourself. You are going to
get some calls about that.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.406
Sure. Let me just slide you
over here a little bit.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.017
And it started off
as a winged elm...

11:10.060 --> 11:11.496
- Uh-huh.
- ...and then it just became

11:11.540 --> 11:13.455
- a white oak.
- Yeah, Wendy get the painting.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.283
- It's so big.
- Should I put it--

11:15.326 --> 11:18.242
Put it in the van like you have
the other 6,000 times, yeah.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.070
Uh, Ambrosia?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.769
You gave me another 30 minutes,
and it would've been a sequoia.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.640
- Oh, my goodness.
- Or a redwood.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.294
- Yeah.
- Mr. Nargle.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.209
- Yeah, right over here.
- Um, hi.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.253
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.690
- Sorry.
- Wow.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.214
It-- It is an honor to--
to meet you, sir.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.737
- Thank you.
- You know, when I was a kid,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.478
my-- my parents
used your show

11:36.521 --> 11:37.784
to teach me
that anything is possible...

11:37.827 --> 11:39.437
- Did they? Oh.
- ...as long as you put

11:39.481 --> 11:41.048
your brushes to it, right?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.310
- And now here I am.
- Who-- Who is this?

11:42.353 --> 11:43.877
It's, uh, Ambrosia.
Isn't she great?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.705
She's absolutely fantastic.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.750
In three, two, one.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.056
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.405
- Wait, what's going on?
- No, no, no, no.

11:50.448 --> 11:51.711
What's happening?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.190
Nothing that
you have to worry about.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.844
You're Carl Nargle.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.803
You don't even
have to look behind you,

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
and I mean that literally
and figuratively.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.154
Let's-- Let's--
Let's go talk.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.678
<i>This is
"Paint with Ambrosia."</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:04.506
A blank canvas.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.203
That's how we all begin.

12:06.247 --> 12:10.512
Is it intimidating,
or is it an opportunity

12:10.555 --> 12:14.472
to create something that
the world has never seen before?

12:14.516 --> 12:17.519
If I'm being honest,
it's a little of both.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.348
But I, for one,
am thrilled to be joining you

12:20.391 --> 12:23.525
on this journey
of self-discovery.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.266
So let's paint.

12:25.309 --> 12:28.486
<i>A rock.
Let's paint a rock.</i>

12:28.530 --> 12:30.532
<i>When I think of rocks,</i>

12:30.575 --> 12:34.536
<i>I like to think about
what's inside first,</i>

12:34.579 --> 12:36.799
<i>because that's
what really matters.</i>

12:36.843 --> 12:39.802
Uh, w-- I--
<i>I</i> have no doubt

12:39.846 --> 12:41.195
that, uh,
a little friendly competition

12:41.238 --> 12:44.328
will bring out
the best in you, Carl.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.374
Obviously,
there's no competition

12:46.417 --> 12:47.941
between you and Ambrosia.

12:47.984 --> 12:51.509
What I'm trying to say
is, uh,

12:51.553 --> 12:54.295
the young bull is happy
to learn

12:54.338 --> 12:55.775
from the old bull,
though, inevitably,

12:55.818 --> 12:58.995
the young bull will kill
the old bull.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.868
More power to Ambrosia
if she can pull it... off.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.260
That came out wrong.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.133
I'm sorry
if I'm interrupting.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.745
Uh, Alexandra Moore from
the <i>Burlington Bonnet.</i>

13:09.789 --> 13:11.747
Are you ready
for the interview?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.401
Interview?

13:13.444 --> 13:15.838
The <i>Bonnet</i> series
on Vermont state treasures.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.493
You're number four,
tied with snow.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.451
I left a message for you
on your cellphone.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.018
I still haven't gotten
the hang of using

13:22.062 --> 13:23.759
the answering machine
inside of it.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.631
Sorry. Used to be you had
a person take a message for you.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, well, is now a-a good time

13:28.895 --> 13:31.767
to take me to a special place
where we can talk?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.856
Carl's van.
I-I'm sure he's flattered,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.684
but he's also
in a relationship.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.252
I-I-I was speaking
metaphorically. I--

13:38.295 --> 13:40.341
If you mean the back
of Carl's van, take a number.

13:40.384 --> 13:44.867
Uh... o-or we-- we could go
to your office, Carl.

13:44.911 --> 13:48.088
Wow. Just running through
stop signs. Incredible.

13:48.131 --> 13:51.134
Are you guys okay with me
quoting you on this?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.962
Yeah, anything
to help the station.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.355
<i>As you may have gathered...</i>

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226

13:56.270 --> 13:58.663
<i>...I am a bit
of a risk-taker,</i>

13:58.707 --> 14:01.449
<i>and I have never painted
a stump,</i>

14:01.492 --> 14:04.017
<i>so I'm going to do that
for my second painting.</i>

14:04.060 --> 14:07.324
Two paintings in one hour?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.849
Not that that's a big deal.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.546
Why is that such a big deal?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.983
Nobody paints
two paintings in an hour.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.812
It takes paint
to a whole new place,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.467
and it's been
a lot of places.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.731
Could be our "Dancing with
the Stars," "Shark Tank" block.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.950
Oh, I love
"Dancing with the Stars."

14:23.993 --> 14:26.909
It's my favorite show.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.224
It's been wonderful
talking to you.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.095
Good night, everyone.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.579
Ouf.
I've never seen him that mad.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.189
Tonight's supposed to be
our night.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.713
- What am I supposed to do?
- I'm headed to Price Chopper

14:48.757 --> 14:51.107
to hang out in the beer aisle
if you want to join.

14:51.151 --> 14:54.067
She just picked up a case of the
lonelies, make 'em less lonely.

14:54.110 --> 14:58.332
If you do it right, you don't
even have to leave the store.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.464
<i>Every stump has roots, right,</i>

15:00.508 --> 15:03.946
<i>evidence where it started.</i>

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
Is that a second painting?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.908
It's a stump.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.170
Incredible.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.229
<i>♪ Lay no boogie woogie

15:40.678 --> 15:43.203
"Dancing with the Stars"

15:54.562 --> 15:56.564
<i>That's what makes

<i>Get in.</i>

16:10.491 --> 16:12.580

I guess Jenna's going to get
her picture tonight, huh?

16:22.198 --> 16:25.419
Hm. Did I ever tell you
about the time I got mine?

16:25.462 --> 16:26.768
Oh, God, please don't.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.858
I mean, you have.
Many times. Too many.

16:29.901 --> 16:33.079
It's all a blur, but I remember
it like it was yesterday.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.995
I know.
Just maybe don't this time.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.301
This one time.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.999
He'd finished
all of his chowder

16:40.042 --> 16:41.348
and most of his bread bowl,

16:41.391 --> 16:44.090
and then he turned to me

17:18.820 --> 17:20.604
Oh, Carl.

<i>But why are the UFO

<i>Until we paint again,

- Ratings are in.
- What, for Ambrosia?

18:07.042 --> 18:09.784
- H-- No, last week.
- Oh.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.700
You know, I was just trying
to kind of paint the opposite

18:12.743 --> 18:14.093
- of what Carl does...
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.965
...and that ended up being
a UFO

18:17.008 --> 18:19.446
- covered in blood.
- Oh, dear goodness.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.929
- You're Katherine.
- Uh...

18:24.973 --> 18:27.976
Whoa, okay,
so Carl said

18:28.019 --> 18:30.109

August 15, 1993.

18:35.026 --> 18:38.029
Wow, that was, yeah,
so long ago.

18:38.073 --> 18:41.903
- I practically forgot about that.
- Did you say

18:41.946 --> 18:43.992
- "UFO covered in blood"?
- Yeah.

18:44.035 --> 18:48.736
So our viewers call the station
a lot when they're upset.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.695
- No more blood. No more UFOs.
- Got it. Got it.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.654
- Understood?
- Yes.

Well, you keep

18:59.964 --> 19:03.968
it'll be your profile
in the <i>Burlington Bonnet.</i>

Here we go.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.024
Um, I, uh...

19:16.067 --> 19:20.594
I've been vegan
since I was 7.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.727
Really?

19:23.771 --> 19:27.166
Shouldn't be a crime in having
another relish tray, I guess.

19:30.386 --> 19:33.346
Not tonight.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.783

19:47.577 --> 19:51.102
Mmm, and the meat under it--
so much.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.627
Veal. Or was it lamb?

19:53.670 --> 19:56.412
No, no, the gray one
was definitely the veal.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.761
Are you okay?

19:57.805 --> 19:58.980
- Yeah.
- You want something

- Hurry.

20:00.677 --> 20:03.637

maybe pottery.

20:23.047 --> 20:26.137
Yeah, but so good
at the copier

20:26.181 --> 20:28.531

all the...

20:28.575 --> 20:30.968
Well, how many pages

20:31.012 --> 20:33.580
- 24.
- 24?

I don't even know where
the cover sheets are.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.328
Well, I could show you.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.939
I-I guess
what I'm trying to say

is the station's been
so good to me,

20:46.941 --> 20:48.682

for you.

20:48.725 --> 20:55.602

in something

20:58.169 --> 21:00.911

21:04.785 --> 21:06.700
Yeah.
Was that Katherine?

21:06.743 --> 21:08.876

it's funny how my eye

21:08.919 --> 21:10.356
doesn't even go to her.

Since the day
that Wendy was hired, right?

Katherine...

23:15.132 --> 23:18.788
you run PBS Burlington
without the GM title,

23:32.672 --> 23:34.587

24:01.091 --> 24:05.139
I actually, um, think
there might be another

24:05.182 --> 24:09.491
teal-and-desert-sand-colored TV

24:09.535 --> 24:13.408

finding the TV.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.747
Oh, um, I forgot.

24:47.790 --> 24:52.273
I-- I moved it into the other
room when I got a bigger bed.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.709
Oh.

24:55.406 --> 25:02.065
Slide over to his clavicle.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.632
Maybe the kisses
are even gentler here.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.895
Speaking of TVs,
I don't know if you heard this,

25:05.939 --> 25:10.596
but they are showing "Paint"
on Channel 9 in Rutland.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.425
Do you know what that is?

25:14.469 --> 25:17.080
I don't get down to Rutland
as much as I'd like.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.909
Soft blowing

25:19.953 --> 25:21.432
There's not a highway

25:30.093 --> 25:32.052
I think I'm going to throw up.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.141
Okay,
maybe the highway system

25:34.184 --> 25:35.621
isn't the only thing
moving too fast.

25:35.664 --> 25:39.973
I mean, from the--
from the meat.

25:40.016 --> 25:44.107
I can't stop thinking about
how I have a cow inside me.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.762
You mean the veal?

25:53.421 --> 25:54.988
I just want you to know

25:55.031 --> 25:58.861
that I can't imagine tonight
being any better.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.170
Can you?

26:03.213 --> 26:04.867
Same.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.350
Is this Portuguese flannel?

26:09.393 --> 26:12.396
I don't know.
I got it at the store.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.094
I'm just going to brush
my teeth super fast,

26:14.137 --> 26:15.530
and I'll be right out.

26:15.574 --> 26:20.100
- W-Well, t-take your time.
- Oh, no.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.885
<i>Overlooking Mount Mansfield
seems impossible</i>

26:22.929 --> 26:24.931
<i>because it's
the biggest thing in Vermont,</i>

26:24.974 --> 26:26.889
<i>but some people do,</i>

26:26.933 --> 26:29.979
and they fall in love
with Camel's Hump,

26:30.023 --> 26:34.157
which is barely in
the top-four tallest mountains.

26:34.201 --> 26:38.205
Given the choice, I guess
I'd rather be Mount Mansfield.

26:38.248 --> 26:42.209
Thanks for going to a special
place with me, Carl Nargle.

26:42.252 --> 26:45.125
And we're clear. Ambrosia.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.256
- Right?
- Okay.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.867
Right over here.
Here we go.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.347
Careful.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.698
Tony, did you hear what I said
about Camel's Hump?

26:52.741 --> 26:54.047
Yeah, really moving.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.875
It's another great one,
Mr. Nargle.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.051
It's amazing
how you keep doing it.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.095
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.619
I thought that was great.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.577
I could take your pipe
for you.

27:04.579 --> 27:07.669
Good luck.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.677
And in three, two...

27:15.721 --> 27:18.114
<i>Hi, friends, and welcome to
"Paint with Ambrosia."</i>

27:18.158 --> 27:20.247
<i>Today's painting
is inspired by</i>

27:20.290 --> 27:23.859
the heart of this station, Katherine,

27:23.903 --> 27:26.166
and as a way of saying
thank you,

27:26.209 --> 27:28.516
I'm going to paint her
a bullet train,

27:28.559 --> 27:33.347
because once a bullet train
gets started, it's hard to stop.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.662
Are you--
Are you yelling at me?

27:43.705 --> 27:46.926
Yes. When I finished
my painting show yesterday,

27:46.969 --> 27:49.058
I wanted pretzels.
No one brought me any, Tony.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.495
Carl, I know it's a period
of adjustment with--

27:51.539 --> 27:54.281
with Ambrosia here, but let me
tell you what's happening.

27:54.324 --> 27:57.719
What's happening is people need
to start doing their jobs,

27:57.763 --> 27:58.981
which isn't going to happen

27:59.025 --> 28:00.722
if Katherine
and the rest of the staff

28:00.766 --> 28:03.116
are watching one too many
painting shows in a row

28:03.159 --> 28:06.075
instead of doing whatever it
is they're supposed to be doing.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.903
I'm going to keep them
to an hour break, okay, but

28:07.947 --> 28:09.949
- that's good energy here, Carl.
- Thank you. I know.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.733
- I don't want to lose it.
- I don't, either.

28:11.777 --> 28:15.650
These are exciting times here
at the new PBS Burlington.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.306
- Are these the new tote bags?
- Huh.

28:19.349 --> 28:22.701
Yeah. It's only
because yours weren't selling.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.747
Let me rephrase that.
It's only because

28:25.791 --> 28:29.577
yours... weren't... selling.

I got each of you presents,

and it's just a little something
just to say

31:38.809 --> 31:41.987
how much I appreciate
everything that you do

than typing?

It's from T.J. Maxx.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.523
Carl, do you remember
how you left me?

31:56.566 --> 31:59.221
<i>This is Painter
looking for Tater Hots.</i>

31:59.265 --> 32:01.658
<i>Come back, Tater Hots. Over.</i>

32:04.183 --> 32:06.707
This is Tater Hots.
What's your 20, painter?

32:06.750 --> 32:09.840
You coming over?
Over.

32:09.884 --> 32:12.974
No, Tater Hots.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.585
It's over. Over.

32:15.629 --> 32:20.503
What do you mean,
it's <i>over</i> over? Over.

32:20.547 --> 32:24.246
Hoping we can stay
good buddies, good buddy.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
Over.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.815
<i>And out.</i>

32:41.611 --> 32:45.093
Then it was on to Beverly,
who you dumped for Jenna.

32:45.137 --> 32:48.009
- Sorry.
- Water over the bridge.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.184
You know,
one time you said

32:49.228 --> 32:51.099
that I looked sexy
in my tracksuit,

32:51.143 --> 32:55.190
so I've been wearing
Juicy Couture ever since.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.887
I wear this to church,

32:56.931 --> 33:00.848
and there are kids there
who think that this is my name,

33:00.891 --> 33:04.025
Good, Christian children
who say,

33:04.069 --> 33:06.245
"We're praying for you,
Juicy."

33:06.288 --> 33:08.682
I want to go to a special place
with you, Carl Nargle,

33:08.725 --> 33:12.686
as long as that special place is
hell, and I can watch you burn.

33:17.647 --> 33:20.781
Can I say something?

33:20.824 --> 33:23.566
If you don't like
the coffee mugs, then, I mean,

33:23.610 --> 33:28.441
I have these Green Mountain
Coffee discount coupons,

33:28.484 --> 33:29.790
- and--
- Son of a bitch.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.793
I also got you guys a gift.

33:32.836 --> 33:36.666
I, uh, realized that I had only
made something for Katherine,

33:36.710 --> 33:39.669
and I wanted to make sure
that you all felt seen

33:39.713 --> 33:41.062
and appreciated.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.630
So I made you all paintings.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.720
- They're on the stage.
- Score.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.069
Yeah.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.376
I'm returning this
for store credit.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.123

makes people happy.

34:00.777 --> 34:03.911
I'm not trying to make
anybody feel bad.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.667
I know you want
to get a painting.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.495
No, I don't.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.497
Go on. It's okay.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.889
Go ahead.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.543
Thank you.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.879
Oh, good,

That's what he told me.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.725
Thank you, Sylvia and Portia.

38:56.769 --> 39:00.120
They all fall for Carl.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.427
Another call for Carl.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.081
And one for Ambrosia.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.216
<i>Incredible.</i>

39:09.259 --> 39:11.087
How did you do that?

39:13.002 --> 39:17.398
Thank you,
Jay Fogarty from Chittenden.

39:17.442 --> 39:21.184
You are magic.

39:21.228 --> 39:26.146
If you want your portrait
painted by Ambrosia,

39:26.189 --> 39:31.978
you need to bid
more than $435,

39:32.021 --> 39:36.809
and if you want your portrait
painted by Carl Nargle,

39:36.852 --> 39:43.468
you need to bid
more than $875

39:43.511 --> 39:47.428
in the next 10, 9, 8,

39:47.472 --> 39:49.952
7, 6, 5,

39:49.996 --> 39:54.217
4, 3, 2, 1.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.610
- That's it.
- That's it.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.133
No more calls.

39:57.177 --> 40:01.486
PBS Burlington pledge drive.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.618
- Does that count?
- It's too late, isn't it?

40:03.662 --> 40:04.706
I think it's over, right?

40:04.750 --> 40:07.622
Does that count?

40:07.666 --> 40:09.319
Yes.

40:09.363 --> 40:14.412
Yes. I'm writing it down.
We're all very excited.

40:14.455 --> 40:17.197
It's been a great day.

40:17.240 --> 40:21.810
Thank you so much for everything
you've done for the station.

40:21.854 --> 40:28.426
Well?

40:28.469 --> 40:30.340
Jay Fogerty's mother
would like to pick him up

40:30.384 --> 40:32.517
in front of the station
in 10 minutes.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.650
That's it.

40:35.694 --> 40:39.132
Thank you!
Keep those pledges coming.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.484
- We did it.
- It's for a good cause.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.791
Look at Bridget,

40:45.834 --> 40:49.185
lighting up the stage
with her radiant smile.

40:49.229 --> 40:51.361
She is a winner.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.060
PBS Burlington is also smiling.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.714
You know,
Mary is also a winner.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.846
It's such a joy to paint.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.631
They both look great.

40:59.674 --> 41:03.635
And another great thing
about PBS Burlington is--

41:03.678 --> 41:05.550
Bridget's generosity,

41:05.593 --> 41:08.378
which kind of
puts us all to shame.

41:08.422 --> 41:11.207
It's an honor
for me to be up here painting

41:11.251 --> 41:14.820
someone who bid
so much more than anyone else.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.256
Thank you, Bridget.

41:16.299 --> 41:19.433
And thank you to Mary.
I am so grateful.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.741
You know, she hasn't worked in
eight years, so her bid

41:22.784 --> 41:24.525
is actually a higher percentage
of net worth,

41:24.569 --> 41:27.354
which, you know, feels like
the true barometer.

41:27.397 --> 41:29.182
Bridget,
she's not going to be able

41:29.225 --> 41:31.358
to visit her grandkids
this year.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.968
Can't afford it, right?

41:33.012 --> 41:35.754
So it's a little scary
how much this means to her.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.277
That's-- That's so sad.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.932
But, you know,
Mary had to turn off her heat.

41:39.975 --> 41:42.500
- I'll turn off <i>your</i> heat.
- You never turned it on.

41:42.543 --> 41:45.677
- Never tried to.
- Done.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.939
I was already done.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.941
How much do we raise?

41:48.984 --> 41:50.725
Almost $8,000.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.422
How much do we need?

41:52.466 --> 41:56.557
- A little less than $300,000.
- Ah.

41:56.601 --> 42:00.343
Mary, this is for you.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.520
I call it "Rich in Spirit."

42:02.563 --> 42:05.740
I've always wanted a laser.

42:05.784 --> 42:08.221
Bridget, are you ready?

42:10.876 --> 42:12.791
This is for you.

42:12.834 --> 42:16.969
I call it
"Mighty Mount Mansfield."

42:17.012 --> 42:22.801
On an early, surprisingly
chilly April morning.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.806
Can you see it?

42:27.849 --> 42:31.157
Why was I smiling
that whole time?

42:31.200 --> 42:33.333
That's just the same mountain
you always paint.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.770
That doesn't look
anything like me.

42:37.467 --> 42:41.515
It's the same painting
as Valentine's Day Season 8.

42:41.559 --> 42:45.432
- The creek is smaller.
- The creek is smaller.

42:45.475 --> 42:50.611
That is...
because, um...

42:50.655 --> 42:54.876
Carl didn't
want to ruin the surprise.

42:54.920 --> 42:59.011
Yes, you both are actually
getting two paintings.

42:59.054 --> 43:06.105
Yeah, a portrait from me and one
of Carl's incredible landscapes.

43:06.148 --> 43:09.195
We just didn't want either
of you to not get a Nargle.

43:09.238 --> 43:12.633
He was supposed
to paint my portrait.

43:12.677 --> 43:16.332
I spent my snack allowance
for the next eight years.

43:16.376 --> 43:18.683
I know, Bridget, but did you
hear what Ambrosia said?

43:18.726 --> 43:21.642
You're going to get
a portrait by her,

43:21.686 --> 43:25.385
as well as this painting
of Mighty Mount Mansfield.

43:28.518 --> 43:30.216
And...

43:36.526 --> 43:38.354
...$29.

43:41.706 --> 43:45.666
Another $20.
Just... here you go.

43:45.710 --> 43:52.891
Which brings us to $74, and you
can head over to craft service

43:52.934 --> 43:55.458
and get anything you want.

43:55.502 --> 43:59.724
Sandwiches, some raisins.

43:59.767 --> 44:02.422
Well... shit.

44:06.513 --> 44:10.560
You know, I get so many
questions about my tote bag

44:10.604 --> 44:12.388
every time I'm in a restaurant.

44:12.432 --> 44:16.610
What's wrong?

44:16.654 --> 44:18.438
I know how to save the station.

44:21.136 --> 44:24.270
<i>Let's add a little smoke
to these chimneys,</i>

44:24.313 --> 44:28.578
<i>see if we can make them
even a little cozier.</i>

44:28.622 --> 44:30.972
I think Ambrosia might be
a little jealous

44:31.016 --> 44:36.325
if she saw you watching this.

44:36.369 --> 44:40.895
I'm just making sure
all your old tapes still play.

44:43.332 --> 44:46.379
Boy, it really takes you back,
doesn't it?

44:46.422 --> 44:49.338
<i>Of course, this river...</i>

44:49.382 --> 44:51.906
Look at that shirt.

44:51.950 --> 44:54.866
It's really held up.

44:54.909 --> 44:57.129
So it has.

44:57.172 --> 45:03.265
And that little hamlet is where
I took you for our first date.

45:03.309 --> 45:05.572
Good memory, yeah.

45:05.615 --> 45:07.487
Great memory.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.663
You know, I forgot how much
you used to paint

45:09.707 --> 45:12.013
all this other stuff.

45:12.057 --> 45:18.324
Ice cream stands and
windmills and birds in flight.

45:18.367 --> 45:23.155
Now it's just Mount Mansfield
in every single painting.

45:25.070 --> 45:29.770
Hard not to hold on
to a dream or two.

45:34.383 --> 45:36.734
Why did you do it?

45:41.782 --> 45:46.613
I dropped out of college for
us, and I was really great.

45:46.656 --> 45:50.660
And then I realized that "us"
was really-- really you.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.227
And you got famous,

45:52.271 --> 45:56.797
and then you started to treat me
like everybody else.

45:56.841 --> 45:59.844
I mean, not bad. Never bad.

45:59.887 --> 46:05.371
Just... not special.

46:05.414 --> 46:11.681
And then someone else paid
so much attention to me.

46:11.725 --> 46:13.509
And I made a mistake.

47:04.430 --> 47:09.783
I couldn't live with myself,
so I told you.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.133
Just begged you to forgive me.

47:15.615 --> 47:19.662
Then like, a minute later,
you were having sex with Wendy.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.321
I just spent the rest of my life
watching you make everybody else

47:26.365 --> 47:28.889
in my life
fall in love with you.

47:31.892 --> 47:34.112
I just...

47:34.155 --> 47:35.548
I wish I would have known

47:35.591 --> 47:37.898
what I should have
done differently.

47:40.901 --> 47:42.424
Me, too.

47:46.211 --> 47:47.777
Guess who gets to watch

47:47.821 --> 47:52.304
Seasons 2 through 8
of "Paint With Carl Nargle"?

47:52.347 --> 47:55.481
Sounds like a dream come true.

47:55.524 --> 48:00.007
There's a lot of--
a lot of good stuff in there.

48:06.796 --> 48:08.494
Did I do something wrong?

48:10.583 --> 48:12.672
You did not.

48:21.724 --> 48:23.378
Oh, hey. Grab a seat.

48:23.422 --> 48:26.381
I have some exciting news
I want to talk to you about.

48:26.425 --> 48:29.732
Always nice
to hear exciting news.

48:29.776 --> 48:31.909
Ready?

48:31.952 --> 48:33.867
I have found you
an incredible job.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.216
What?

48:35.260 --> 48:37.001
Teaching at
the University of Vermont,

48:37.044 --> 48:40.613
where you will be passing
along your incredible skills

48:40.656 --> 48:43.703
to students
from around the world.

48:43.746 --> 48:45.009
I love the idea of giving back.

48:45.052 --> 48:47.925
I mean,
that is a big honor, right?

48:47.968 --> 48:50.971
I just think with my work here,
I'm not going to have the time.

48:51.015 --> 48:53.887
Exactly.

48:53.931 --> 48:57.064
Carl, our revenues is way down

48:57.108 --> 48:59.675
and you're making
$46,000 a year.

48:59.719 --> 49:03.201
Now, UVM will give you
a $4,000 raise.

49:03.244 --> 49:05.072
And here's the best part.

49:05.116 --> 49:08.032
We have 22 years of reruns
of your show.

49:08.075 --> 49:10.904
People will
never even know you left.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.384
It's the best of both worlds.

49:12.427 --> 49:15.256
So I'll host "Paint,"
teach at UVM.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.998
22 years of reruns
you're going to be showing.

49:18.042 --> 49:21.175
You're turning ol' Carl Nargle
into a workhorse.

49:21.219 --> 49:22.829
A damn Clydesdale.

49:22.872 --> 49:24.570
Except here's the thing.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.399
Ambrosia will create the new
shows that'll bring in the kids.

49:27.442 --> 49:32.404
Your reruns will be there
for our core 65-plus audience.

49:32.447 --> 49:37.322
You don't have to host a new
episode of "Paint" ever again.

49:41.108 --> 49:42.675
But I want to keep painting.

49:42.718 --> 49:45.678
You will, at UVM.

49:45.721 --> 49:48.420
50 students a day watching you.

49:48.463 --> 49:53.903
That's a 400% bump in
the 18-to-25 demo for you.

49:53.947 --> 49:55.470
Yeah.

49:55.514 --> 50:00.823
I just got a couple
of things for you to sign

50:00.867 --> 50:02.738
saying-- here you go.

50:02.782 --> 50:04.740
Right here.

50:04.784 --> 50:06.394
Saying we didn't--
Go ahead.

50:06.438 --> 50:10.659
We didn't fire you
because you're old.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.403
Good. That's very good.

50:15.447 --> 50:18.363
Thank you, Carl.
That's all I got.

50:18.406 --> 50:20.104
I'll see you.

50:20.147 --> 50:22.671
Sure.

50:43.518 --> 50:45.259
Carl.

50:47.348 --> 50:49.481
Hey, Carl.

50:49.524 --> 50:51.222
I just...

50:53.137 --> 50:57.576
I wanted to say thank you,
you know, for paving the way.

50:59.795 --> 51:03.364
I had that plate for 30 years.

51:03.408 --> 51:06.933
Yeah, no, I used
to see you parked at Lums.

51:06.976 --> 51:08.500
"Home of the lumber."

51:08.543 --> 51:12.373
You added an E
to the Mona Lisa.

51:12.417 --> 51:13.809
But here's the deal.

51:13.853 --> 51:18.118
No one's waiting in line
to see the Mona E. Lisa,

51:18.162 --> 51:20.338
because that's
a really dumb name.

51:20.381 --> 51:22.340
Not very original.

51:22.383 --> 51:26.344
You never tried to get
P-A-I-N-T-E-R?

51:26.387 --> 51:28.085
No, I didn't.

51:28.128 --> 51:30.652
And a real artist would
never Etch-a-Sketch a dinosaur

51:30.696 --> 51:33.090
and then give it to someone,
because that's really dumb, too.

51:33.133 --> 51:35.527
Carl, you used
your brush to seduce

51:35.570 --> 51:37.920
and destroy people
who loved you.

51:37.964 --> 51:42.534
No, I opened their car doors,
picked up every check,

51:42.577 --> 51:44.536
and always carried
the big suitcases.

51:44.579 --> 51:46.407
Did you ever try
treating them as equals?

51:46.451 --> 51:48.322
No.
I treated them better than me.

51:48.366 --> 51:49.367
It's called being a gentleman.

51:49.410 --> 51:50.716
Until you moved on to the next.

51:50.759 --> 51:52.239
Because your girlfriend
made a mistake.

51:52.283 --> 51:54.285
<i>You're</i> a mistake.

51:58.071 --> 52:00.378
You're lucky I'm an artist
instead of a woman

52:00.421 --> 52:02.989
who says really mean
things to other women,

52:03.032 --> 52:05.165
'cause I would have plenty
to say to you.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.428
<i>Plenty.</i>

52:07.472 --> 52:09.865
You <i>were</i> an artist.

52:20.572 --> 52:22.400
Carl's the reason
I started working here.

52:22.443 --> 52:25.403
Him, and because Quiznos
wasn't hiring.

52:25.446 --> 52:27.448
The place has great hours.

52:27.492 --> 52:30.451
- He is such a turd.
- Come on.

52:30.495 --> 52:33.367
You couldn't afford
to pay his salary

52:33.411 --> 52:35.108
and keep the station going.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.197
Yeah.

52:37.241 --> 52:41.810
Sometimes you just have
no choice but to move on.

52:51.864 --> 52:58.305
♪ You fill up my senses

52:58.349 --> 52:59.785

leave the back of this van.

53:02.004 --> 53:04.181
God, that sounds like heaven.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.273

What are you doing?

53:11.666 --> 53:14.495

of you to memory

53:14.539 --> 53:17.194
so I can relive this moment

53:17.237 --> 53:21.154
every moment
for the rest of my life.

53:21.198 --> 53:23.287
The way you look, the way you...

53:23.330 --> 53:27.987
Even the texture of
this arm rest,

53:28.030 --> 53:31.338
the hum of the space heater.

53:31.382 --> 53:33.862
Do you smell that?

53:33.906 --> 53:35.821
- No.

and there isn't much of it.

53:38.911 --> 53:41.653
She runs pretty clean.

53:41.696 --> 53:44.395
I just--
I know I'm always gonna

53:44.438 --> 53:48.660
remember how I feel right now,
because I just...

53:48.703 --> 53:51.706
I just always want
to feel this way.

53:51.750 --> 53:56.624
I'm ready to feel
how you feel right now.

54:03.849 --> 54:05.938
- Mm.
- That's the arm rest.

54:05.981 --> 54:07.679
- What?
- That's the--

54:07.722 --> 54:09.942
That's the arm rest.

54:12.901 --> 54:14.860
That's it. That's me.

54:14.903 --> 54:16.992
Oh, that's all me.

54:20.953 --> 54:24.173
I have to ask you something
that's really hard to ask.

54:24.217 --> 54:25.784
Hello.

54:25.827 --> 54:29.266
Why didn't you
just paint the portrait?

54:29.309 --> 54:34.140
You could just paint one amazing
portrait and blow Ambrosia away.

54:34.183 --> 54:36.055
- It's stupid.
- Decided I was going to ask you

54:36.098 --> 54:38.362
to drive me home if you
weren't going to answer me.

54:38.405 --> 54:42.322
Okay.

54:42.366 --> 54:45.238
19 years ago,
Dr. Bradford Lenihan

54:45.282 --> 54:47.806
said the
Burlington Museum of Art

54:47.849 --> 54:51.505
lacked a painting of Vermont's
highest peak, Mount Mansfield,

54:51.549 --> 54:56.423
and I really, really wanted
a painting in that museum.

55:06.868 --> 55:08.609
And?

55:08.653 --> 55:15.050
So I started painting it,
in case he was watching.

55:15.094 --> 55:16.835
Let me guess.

55:16.878 --> 55:20.839
Dr. Bradford Lenihan didn't
like the way you painted it?

55:20.882 --> 55:23.929
Well, it's--
it's more complicated.

55:23.972 --> 55:25.365
Well, then I should go

55:25.409 --> 55:27.062
if you don't think
I'll understand anything.

55:27.106 --> 55:29.326
I don't know. I don't know.

55:29.369 --> 55:30.762
What do you mean,
you don't know?

55:30.805 --> 55:33.895
I--I don't...

55:35.114 --> 55:38.770
I don't know if he ever
watched the show.

55:38.813 --> 55:43.165
You never thought to call him

55:43.209 --> 55:45.603
or to walk one of your
thousands of paintings

55:45.646 --> 55:49.389
down to him
over the last 19 years?

55:49.433 --> 55:51.609
What if he said no?

55:57.484 --> 55:59.747
A real artist
follows his heart,

55:59.791 --> 56:02.837
no matter what the price.

56:02.881 --> 56:04.622
You spent your whole life
playing it safe,

56:04.665 --> 56:08.887
and now you've lost everything.

56:08.930 --> 56:10.323
<i>Everything.</i>

56:10.367 --> 56:11.890
And I have
another question for you.

56:13.718 --> 56:15.328
How come we never have sex?
People tell me I'm attractive.

56:15.372 --> 56:18.592
You're very attractive.
Will you just come inside?

56:22.770 --> 56:25.164
The beautiful part is
we're moving on together,

56:25.207 --> 56:27.166
and once I began teaching...

56:29.690 --> 56:31.736
The only reason you care
about me now is because

56:31.779 --> 56:34.652
I'm the one thing you have left.

56:40.397 --> 56:43.008
My Uber is here.

56:43.051 --> 56:47.578
I don't know what that is.

56:47.621 --> 56:50.450
It's goodbye.

57:02.810 --> 57:06.074
I'm Carl Nargle, and I'm going
to be your professor.

57:09.513 --> 57:11.166
Thank you.

57:11.210 --> 57:14.039
Listen, our goal
this semester is pretty simple.

57:14.082 --> 57:17.216
I want to help you get
what's in here

57:17.259 --> 57:18.913
and just splash it on to there.

57:18.957 --> 57:21.742
Don't worry.
It's not rocket science.

57:21.786 --> 57:23.352
It's harder.

57:25.180 --> 57:28.096
Is it true that Ambrosia's
teaching this class with you?

57:28.140 --> 57:31.230
Well, I mean, she may stop
by one of these days.

57:31.273 --> 57:32.971
You never know
who's going to join us

57:33.014 --> 57:35.495
or where we might be going.

57:35.539 --> 57:38.237
So let's get there.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.022
Sorry if that came out wrong.

57:41.066 --> 57:42.415
Um...

57:42.459 --> 57:45.810
we still want to see you, too.

57:45.853 --> 57:48.203
Thanks.
Well, should we get started?

57:48.247 --> 57:52.120
Because this canvas
ain't going to paint itself.

57:52.164 --> 57:56.951
But it would be great to know
when she was coming,

57:56.995 --> 57:59.519
just so we could make sure
to be in class.

58:01.739 --> 58:03.305
Hey, can I ask you something?

58:03.349 --> 58:05.482
If you were dating somebody,
like, really young

58:05.525 --> 58:08.876
and really beautiful...

58:08.920 --> 58:10.748
...why wouldn't you
have sex with them?

58:10.791 --> 58:13.446
I was hoping you'd talk to me
about Ambrosia.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.404
It's such a mystery.

58:15.448 --> 58:18.843
No, actually, it's not...

58:18.886 --> 58:22.194
I brought Carl his painting
last night, and...

58:22.237 --> 58:25.545
I imagine having sex with her
is like riding a bike,

58:25.589 --> 58:28.069
except instead of pedaling,

58:28.113 --> 58:33.597
you just kind of move
back and forth on the seat.

58:33.640 --> 58:38.123
I've ridden that kind of bike,
and I love bikes.

58:39.733 --> 58:43.694
I have to be somewhere else...

58:43.737 --> 58:45.130
now.

58:48.786 --> 58:50.875
Hi.

58:50.918 --> 58:53.051
Hey.

58:58.404 --> 59:01.929
You went to Carl's house
last night?

59:04.105 --> 59:07.152
He treated you like crap.

59:07.195 --> 59:09.807
And I cheated on him.

59:09.850 --> 59:16.422
Do you love him?

59:16.465 --> 59:18.424
I just...

59:18.467 --> 59:21.035
I feel like I just wasted
my whole life

59:21.079 --> 59:23.211
not loving someone else.

59:31.611 --> 59:34.701
I kind of set you up to say no.

59:34.745 --> 59:38.444
I love you.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.537
<i>What's this?</i>

59:44.581 --> 59:47.366
<i>Why, it's Mount Mansfield.</i>

59:47.409 --> 59:52.937
This, another Mount Mansfield.

59:56.331 --> 01:00:00.074
<i>Sorry, just give me one minute
and I will paint you</i>

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:04.296
<i>the best Mount Mansfield
that you have ever seen.</i>

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:06.515
What a show-off.

01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:11.651
Oh, no.

01:00:16.787 --> 01:00:19.267

Mount Mansfield,

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.331
at night.

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.597
How's everything going, Carl?

01:02:24.131 --> 01:02:26.046
Awesome.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.491
Carl,
the faculty's been talking.

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:40.713
We think what makes
the most sense is to go ahead

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.021
and pay you
for the rest of the semester

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:47.851
and end your class today.

01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:51.463
We've already spoken
with your remaining students,

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:55.641
and they're okay with it.

01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:57.382
Both of them.

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:05.694
<i>This is "Paint with Ambrosia."</i>

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.392
<i>ROYGBIV.</i>

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:10.395
<i>You know, when I was a kid,</i>

01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:13.877
<i>my parents told me that
that was who lived in rainbows.</i>

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.617
<i>Today, I know better.</i>

01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:18.707
<i>Because there are no rainbows.
</i>

01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:21.232
What if ratings go down?

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:25.018
Tony, it is time for me to go.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.588
Booth.

01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:31.808
- Hey, Tony, it's Carl.
- Carl!

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:34.375
Tony, what happened to my show?

01:03:36.203 --> 01:03:39.859
PBS can no longer show people
using tobacco.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.121
What?

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:42.862
You smoked a pipe
in every episode.

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:46.300
We can't air
"Paint With Carl Nargle."

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.911
Not even a rerun.

01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:55.701
Tony, I've got another call.

01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:58.138
That's when you get
call waiting.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.958
Excuse me, Dr. Lenihan?

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.525
Hello.

01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:22.831
- Mr. Carl Nargle.
- Yeah.

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.311
To what do I owe the honor

01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:27.793
of a visit from a living
Vermont state treasure?

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:28.968
Well, I don't know
if you heard,

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:31.057
but I recently retired.

01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:32.929
It was in the paper.

01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:40.284
Yeah, which means I have 4,274
paintings that could use a home.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:43.461
They're mostly
of Mount Mansfield.

01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:46.725
I don't know
if that would interest you.

01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:50.163
We are always looking to
display the work of a master

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:52.383
here at the
Burlington Museum of Art.

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:53.993
Great.

01:05:54.037 --> 01:05:57.475
Someone appreciated for
their impact on the world of art

01:05:57.518 --> 01:06:00.173
or representing something
unique to Vermont.

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:02.697
Yes. Wonderful.

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:06.005
Sadly, we just had
the walls painted,

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.789
and that's something
we're showing off, too.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:12.490
You know, the beauty
of the museum itself.

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:16.015
- Might I offer a suggestion?
- Sure.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:20.977
Have you considered
donating them to a Motel 6?

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.891
Or perhaps a Red Roof Inn?

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:25.677
Your paintings have such warmth,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.682
and that could really appeal
to a weary traveler on a budget.

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:33.772
At the very least, it would
save you quite a bit on storage.

01:06:33.815 --> 01:06:37.036
Yeah, I--I have my own barn,
so that's not--

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.171
Anyway, uh, thank you so much
for your time.

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:42.868
Dr. Lenihan,

01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:46.437
you have a magnificent museum.

01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:52.834
- Carl?
- Yeah.

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:55.185
Can I ask you a question?

01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:56.838
Yeah.

01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:01.452
What's the image tucked away
in your brain

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:03.454
that makes your heart ache

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:07.675
and your soul feel like
it's going to burst?

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:09.721
Uh...

01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:12.419
Mount Mansfield, I presume?

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.384
Whatever that thing is,
those are the paintings

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:22.777
that keep us from
staring at blank walls

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:25.650
here at the
Burlington Museum of Art.

01:07:27.782 --> 01:07:29.741
Well, thank you for stopping by.

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:32.831

Katherine, I know this probably
isn't the best time,

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:52.362
but if I don't say this now,
I never will.

01:09:52.405 --> 01:09:54.842
When we first met,

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:57.845
I painted out of love.

01:09:57.889 --> 01:10:00.500
- My head got turned--
- Hey!

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:05.679
I was just on my way to the--
to the station.

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:08.726
Uh, how you-- how you been?

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:10.945
Some highs, some lows.

01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:14.906
You know, I never--
I never got to say sorry

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:17.735
for painting Mount Mansfield.

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.650
It was all my fault.

01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:22.261
Ambrosia, I just want to finish
what I was saying to Katherine.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:24.089
Actually,
I--I do need to get going.

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:26.961
I'll be fast. Katherine...

01:10:27.005 --> 01:10:31.139
as you know,
I'm better with pictures

01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:32.880
than I am with words.

01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:35.535
But if I could paint you one
in the form of an apology--

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.798
It's over.

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:39.452
Ambrosia, I thought we were
being nice to each other.

01:10:39.496 --> 01:10:41.585
Now it just feels like
you're rubbing my nose in it.

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.456
No, I mean,

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:47.547
<i>we're</i> over.

01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:53.553
She could never love me because
she never stopped loving you.

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:57.862
Hey, Carl.

01:10:58.428 --> 01:11:01.561
Beverly?

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:03.607
I didn't see that coming.

01:11:05.173 --> 01:11:09.526
Hold on. I'm coming.
I'm coming. Here we go.

01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:11.179
Nice to see some old friends.

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:14.182
Yeah, well, we never got around
to throwing them out.

01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.533
- There they are.
- Okay.

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:17.882
- And here.
- That's fine.

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.755
We need this one to air.
Okay? Alright.

01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:24.192
Let's roll the open
in three, two...

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:27.065
Hey, where's Ambrosia?

01:11:27.108 --> 01:11:28.632
Well, she called
and told me to let Carl host.

01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.111
I got something I have to say

01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:32.766
and this
is my only way to say it.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:36.161
And PBS, they need 2 new hours
of programing every day,

01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:39.207
so we are airing "Paint
With Carl Nargle" in five...

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:41.819
Carl--
before you say or do anything,

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:44.343
you should know I'm the one
that got your show canceled.

01:11:44.387 --> 01:11:46.476
Katherine, if you hadn't,

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:48.739
I wouldn't be here right now.

01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:56.094
Hi, I'm Carl Nargle,
and this is "Paint."

01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:58.705
I used to always say
you got to paint from the heart

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:01.926
to live from the heart
without doing either.

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:04.494
Which is why today,
I am starting with

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:07.584
Tangerine Orange 22.

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:13.241
Why Tangerine Orange 22?

01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:15.722
Well...

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:23.687
Because we all have moments
in our lives,

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:28.474
moments we wish
we could go back to

01:12:28.518 --> 01:12:31.869
and live in forever.

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:35.133
<i>Mine is in the back of my van</i>

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:41.052
<i>on a custom-made sofa bed</i>

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:43.663
<i>with a woman I barely knew.</i>

01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:47.711
<i>Yo, it's Ambrosia. Why
aren't you watching my show?</i>

01:12:47.754 --> 01:12:49.713
<i>Ah, just kidding.
You know what to do next--</i>

01:12:49.756 --> 01:12:51.105
But you know what?

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:54.065
It's a perfect memory,

01:12:54.108 --> 01:12:58.286
but what made it perfect
are the imperfections

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:00.332
- we shared together.
- PBS Burlington.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.116
<i>I just want to say
it's great to have Carl back.</i>

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.683
Yes, it is great
to have Carl back.

01:13:03.727 --> 01:13:06.425
Please hold. PBS Burlington.

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:08.427
<i>I'm no longer terrified
watching "Paint."</i>

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:10.081
I agree.

01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:11.212
Carl's paintings are
less terrifying than Ambrosia's.

01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:13.214
Please hold. PBS Burlington.

01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:14.912
<i>- Carl stole my newspaper.</i>
- Yes.

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:16.914
We're aware that Carl
is stealing newspapers.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:21.048
Please hold. PBS Burlington.

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.573
The smell of
transmission fluid,

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.488
though there wasn't much of it.

01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:27.359
She runs pretty clean.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.883
Ambrosia?

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:31.537
<i>Uh, no. Sorry.</i>

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.757
- <i>Katherine?</i>
- Oh.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.107
<i>- It's Brian Hoffman.</i>
- Yes. H--Hi.

01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:37.804
<i>From PBS Sullivan.</i>

01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:39.632
Yes. Hi, Brian. How are you?

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:44.855
I--I'm just packing up
all my stuff here

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:47.074
and really looking forward
to Monday.

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:48.598
<i>We are, too. Uh...</i>

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:52.079
<i>But we went back
and looked at your resume.</i>

01:13:52.123 --> 01:13:55.735
<i>Do you not have
a college degree?</i>

01:13:57.258 --> 01:13:59.565
Because the truth is,
if you spend all your time

01:13:59.609 --> 01:14:04.962
trying to paint
the perfect picture,

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:10.533
<i>you're just gonna miss
the best parts of life.</i>

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:15.755
<i>I know I did.</i>

01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:18.454
Thanks for finally going to

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:24.503
a special place with me,
Carl Nargle.

01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:26.723
Great, great, great.
You can have the show back.

01:14:26.766 --> 01:14:28.072
Anything you want,
you just have to keep painting.

01:14:28.115 --> 01:14:29.421
No, no. That's it.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.814
I don't have anything
left to paint.

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:31.945
- Carl--
- Thanks, Tony.

01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:34.905
- Goodbye. Thanks.
- Carl, Carl.

01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:38.996
I'll fire Ambrosia
if you just come back!

01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:41.477
Which is a joke I like to say...

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.869
...all the time.

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:44.567
But it's not true.

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.569
Hey, everybody, here's
the star of "Paint."

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:49.876
It's Ambrosia.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.184
It's--

01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.839
Hi.

01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:57.754
I'm Tony.

01:14:57.797 --> 01:15:01.801
I'm going to show you
a whole new way to paint

01:15:01.845 --> 01:15:05.544
for the next...
1 hour and 31 minutes.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:10.941
<i>Let's-- Let's just have some
people looking at the bears.</i>

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:13.073
<i>Well, we never did the bear...</i>

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:16.250
<i>The bears, of course, are
no color that I have here,</i>

01:15:16.294 --> 01:15:17.687
<i>so I'll do it with--</i>

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:20.516
Paint from the heart,
live from the heart.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:21.865
She took my advice.

01:15:21.908 --> 01:15:23.475
<i>How's everybody
doing out there?</i>

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:27.479
You should probably
look at this.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.481
<i>There, and that is--</i>

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:33.398
You okay?

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:35.879
What's going on?

01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:39.622
Can I get a number four?

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:41.885
What?

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:44.104
Number four on the chart.

01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:49.501
I put that up in 1979
because it came with the shaver.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:53.723
I had no idea what a number 12
was until you picked it.

01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:56.769
Or what a number four is now.

01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:59.337
Neither do I.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.166
But I want it.

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:57.047
- What?
- My hair.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:59.832
Well, I'm going to have to
charge you for that.

01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:04.750
I'm kidding.
Of course you can have it.

01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:11.017
Hold on.

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:16.980

Carl? Carl!

01:19:07.003 --> 01:19:09.875
Burlington Museum of Art said
they wanted a painting

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:11.181
of Mount Mansfield.

01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:12.835
19 years,
and I never had the guts

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.227
to show them one of mine.

01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.533
You want to know why?

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.143
Yeah, why don't you
tell me outside?

01:19:17.187 --> 01:19:19.885
Because the love of my life,
stepped out on me

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:21.931
with a
Vermont Mountain Express stud.

01:19:21.974 --> 01:19:25.586
I couldn't take the idea of not
being a real artist too.

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.327
Carl!

It-- That doesn't mean
you're not a real man.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.207
It means that <i>I made a mistake.</i>

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.686
No, not as many as me.

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.123
I mean, how many--

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:42.821
how many body parts
can one man autograph?

01:19:42.865 --> 01:19:44.301
And I did drugs.

01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:45.824
That's never the answer.

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:47.608
Come on, Carl, let's go.

01:19:47.652 --> 01:19:49.132
You have chips,
or you don't have chips?

01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:51.438
Do not have chips, Carl.
The barn's on fire.

01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:52.918
- We've got to go.
- You risked your life for me!

01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:54.224
I'm risking my life for you.

01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:57.793
- So you are.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.359
Goodbye, my love.

01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:02.449
- Goodbye, my darling.
- Let's go. Come on.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:06.192
Tough night for Mount Mansfield.

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:09.369
What drugs did you take, Carl?

01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:10.980
The big M.

01:20:11.023 --> 01:20:14.157
Marijuana, but I feel fine.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.681
I do. I do.
Don't worry about me.

01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:19.031
I just thought you'd be able to
handle it a little bit better,

01:20:19.075 --> 01:20:20.728
given the amount
of denim that you wear.

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:22.556
I didn't--

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.342
Sid and Ruben
kind of pushed it on me.

01:20:25.385 --> 01:20:27.997
I smoked it, and then I ate
all the gummy bears.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.174
And I don't even like
gummy bears, but I feel fine.

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:32.610
It's just everything's on fire.

01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:34.742
Carl, where is the painting
from today?

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:38.877
You ran through
the fire to save me, you nut.

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:43.012
- Is it in Vantastic?
- You're insane.

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:46.058
100% certifiable.

01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:49.366
Katherine, you're crazy!

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.194
See if there are any chips
in the glove compartment!

01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:53.500
Ahh! Shoot.

01:20:53.544 --> 01:20:55.894
I'm crazy, too.

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:59.332
This is the real Carl
you're seeing tonight.

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:03.206
Okay, alright.

01:21:03.249 --> 01:21:05.382
- Okay.
- That was fantastic.

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:08.907
It's on fire. We got to go.

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:12.911
Mount Mansfield? Come on!

01:21:16.088 --> 01:21:17.742
Oh, perfect.

01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:26.055
Go around!

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:27.926
Go around!

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:45.074
Carl...

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:04.441
<i>...the finest dairy products

The fire is the lead story
in the news.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:18.237
- CNN?
- Um, Local.

01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:23.721
When do you leave?

01:22:23.764 --> 01:22:27.551
Um, I don't.

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:29.161
They offered me
the assistant job

01:22:29.205 --> 01:22:32.469
when they found out that
I don't have a college degree.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:36.038
- You're not going to take it?
- Mnh-mnh.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.691
I'm done settling.

01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:43.132
Oh, hold on.

01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:46.091
<i>Here's an update
on the Carl Nargle story.</i>

01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:47.875
<i>An unnamed police source</i>

01:22:47.919 --> 01:22:51.923
<i>has told Channel 31 Action News
that Carl Nargle's DNA,</i>

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.491
<i>specifically a large portion
of his hair,</i>

01:22:54.534 --> 01:22:56.710
<i>was found in the ashes.</i>

01:22:56.754 --> 01:22:58.582
<i>With all of
his paintings burned,</i>

01:22:58.625 --> 01:23:00.627
<i>At least we will have his locks</i>

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:04.022
<i>to remember this

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:08.331
<i>And speaking of treasure,

01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:12.639
<i>and for six

01:23:12.683 --> 01:23:15.991
Carl Nargle is dead.

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.428
So he is.

01:23:26.914 --> 01:23:28.873
Good morning.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:40.537
How many Nargles do you have?

01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:48.110
I was originally hired
to do graphics.

01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:50.590
But it's more than just
the article in the paper

01:23:50.634 --> 01:23:54.072
where you ask if a reporter
wants to have sex with Carl

01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:57.554
and you personally hosting
two live paintings shows

01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:59.164
very poorly.

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:01.645
Oh, well,
our overhead's way down.

01:24:01.688 --> 01:24:03.168
So many people quitting.

01:24:03.212 --> 01:24:05.214
There's some positives there.
One sec.

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:07.912
PBS Burlington.

01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:12.221
Anthony, Bradford Lenihan,
calling with my condolences

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:14.397
on the passing of Carl Nargle.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.965
- Yeah, it's a tough day.
<i>- I'll be brief.</i>

01:24:18.009 --> 01:24:22.709
I recently spoke with Carl
about showing at Burlington.

01:24:22.753 --> 01:24:24.668
Everything was burned
in the fire.

01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:29.934
Which means any surviving
Nargles would be quite valuable.

01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:36.027
The Burlington Museum of Art
cannot be a complete collection

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:39.161
of Vermont Beaux-Arts
without at least one Nargle,

01:24:39.204 --> 01:24:41.728
and we are willing
to pay for it.

01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:55.046
<i>Please tell me you have one.</i>

01:24:57.004 --> 01:24:59.006
He made Jenna rich.

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:02.271
- He made you all rich.
- Yeah.

01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:06.188
Should we go inside?

01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:08.233
Yeah.

01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:10.583
Come on.

01:25:10.627 --> 01:25:14.109
- I wish I was dead.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:18.765
I say inappropriate things
when I'm uncomfortable.

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:20.854
Hey, I'm Mandy,

01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:24.510
- Ambrosia's mom.
- Oh, hi.

01:25:24.554 --> 01:25:25.903
Aww.

01:25:25.946 --> 01:25:29.820
- This is MeeMaw.
- Beverly Brown?

01:25:29.863 --> 01:25:32.083

your MeeMaw.

01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:35.826

01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:40.352
And take camera one.

01:25:40.396 --> 01:25:45.618
Our final guest this afternoon
is the new host of "Paint."

01:25:45.662 --> 01:25:48.665
Please welcome
to the show, Mary.

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:51.320
One of the hosts

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:54.758
I'm happy to announce that
thanks to a sizable donation

01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:58.762
from our new GM, Wendy,
and some technological wizardry

01:25:58.805 --> 01:26:01.417
from our new
head of graphics, Tony,

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.071
PBS Burlington was able to
digitally remove

01:26:04.115 --> 01:26:06.639
Carl Nargle's pipe
from his shows

01:26:06.683 --> 01:26:10.687
so we can all watch him take us
to his special place forever.

01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:13.559
