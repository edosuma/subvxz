WEBVTT

00:02.092 --> 00:03.991
We got some bad news yesterday.

00:04.371 --> 00:07.670
Phil's mom died.
It wasn't unexpected.

00:07.888 --> 00:11.259
He was with her and she went
very peacefully in her sleep.

00:11.289 --> 00:12.790
She and I had
a special connection.

00:13.219 --> 00:15.219
- We all did.
- But mostly me.

00:15.693 --> 00:17.093
She said I was just like her.

00:17.277 --> 00:18.477
Was she weirdly competitive too?

00:19.251 --> 00:21.651
The whole family is
going down to Florida

00:21.651 --> 00:22.852
tomorrow to be with Phil
for the service.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.030
Such a relief.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.890
I can feel how much
he needs me right now.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.983
There they are.

00:31.483 --> 00:32.683
Hey, guys.

00:34.122 --> 00:35.082
Oh, you brought my neck pillow.

00:35.113 --> 00:36.784
I missed you so much.

00:38.095 --> 00:39.626
I'm really sorry, Phil.

00:39.656 --> 00:42.763
I only met your mom once.
She sat next to me at Thanksgiving.

00:42.964 --> 00:45.230
And she never said a word about
Claire's lumpy gravy.

00:45.717 --> 00:46.796
All class.

00:46.825 --> 00:48.208
- That was mom.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.708 --> 00:50.480
Phil, I'm so sorry.

00:50.995 --> 00:51.668
Thanks.

00:51.669 --> 00:54.440
Grace was such a kind
and whimsical soul.

00:54.442 --> 00:57.619
The different animals she put
antlers on for Christmas cards--

00:57.702 --> 00:58.505
inspired.

00:58.507 --> 01:00.135
Not a single one
was photoshopped.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.517
- Not even the alligator?
- Cost her the tip of her pinkie,

01:02.519 --> 01:03.981
- but she had no regrets.
- Oh!

01:04.775 --> 01:05.812
I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:05.812 --> 01:07.640
I hope it wasn't too hard
to get away from work.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.672
No. Please, anything for family.

01:09.782 --> 01:11.607
Anything to get me
out of that office.

01:12.122 --> 01:14.978
Ugh! It's all boring paperwork
and endless meetings.

01:15.393 --> 01:17.941
Honestly, this funeral could not
have come at a better time.

01:17.941 --> 01:20.345
Aw, that's sweet.
You should put that on the flowers.

01:22.336 --> 01:24.167
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, guys.

01:24.514 --> 01:26.401
Gloria, you must be so hot in that.

01:26.401 --> 01:29.917
I am in mourning. In Colombia,
we take death very seriously.

01:30.296 --> 01:30.956
Where don't they?

01:30.957 --> 01:33.403
Can we lose the veil?
Nobody's looking for you, Gloria.

01:33.405 --> 01:34.685
Who is Gloria?

01:35.167 --> 01:37.281
I am a wanted woman in Florida.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.671
I used to live there,
and when I left,

01:39.673 --> 01:44.360
my roommate made our apartment
into a house of prostitution,

01:44.494 --> 01:46.022
and my name
was still on the lease.

01:46.024 --> 01:47.007
It's like a traffic ticket.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.872
You walk into court,
pay a fine, it's done.

01:48.994 --> 01:49.823
Quick and easy.

01:49.823 --> 01:52.199
Yes, that was the name
of the whorehouse.

01:52.805 --> 01:54.413
Mitchell, can you
go with her to court?

01:54.413 --> 01:56.007
She's gonna need
some sort of lawyer.

01:56.008 --> 01:58.204
Uh, you know, Jay,
Mitchell is so burnt out right now.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.889
He is in desperate need of a break.

01:59.889 --> 02:01.933
Bench warrants are a no-brainer.
And, I mean, come on.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.671
Does Gloria really look
like the kind of woman

02:03.672 --> 02:04.996
who would run a brothel?

02:07.534 --> 02:08.612
- Yeah, I better go with her.
- You should go.

02:08.614 --> 02:09.604
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

02:22.853 --> 02:24.683
There they are!

02:24.684 --> 02:25.921
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.206
Oh, you look beautiful.
Hi, Claire.

02:27.206 --> 02:28.367
How are you holding on, hmm?

02:28.367 --> 02:29.118
Oh, well, you know...

02:29.219 --> 02:30.682
We're getting through it.
Huh, dad?

02:31.207 --> 02:33.184
Ah. I'm doing okay.
A little trouble sleeping.

02:33.366 --> 02:34.428
I'm so used to her snoring,

02:34.429 --> 02:36.439
I may have to borrow
the neighbor's bulldog.

02:37.717 --> 02:39.473
- So how was the trip, kids?
- Awesome.

02:39.503 --> 02:42.480
On the way from the airport,
I saw three fireworks stands...

02:42.511 --> 02:44.594
and a motorcycle rider wearing no helmet.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.637
It's good to be back in America.

02:47.933 --> 02:48.841
Morning, Charlotte!

02:48.843 --> 02:51.186
This is my family from California!

02:51.863 --> 02:54.698
I can tell. They all
look like movie stars.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.623
Ah. Oh, thank you.

02:55.737 --> 02:58.668
That's nuts. I know that woman,
but I have no idea from where.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.849
Yeah. This place is full
of stories like that.

03:02.903 --> 03:04.553
Good morning,
Mr. Dunphy, visitors.

03:04.553 --> 03:06.791
- Please, Shelley, call me Frank.
- No, sir.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.827
That might be the way
they do things at Whistling Pines,

03:08.827 --> 03:11.005
but we run a tight ship
here at Leisure Park.

03:11.006 --> 03:12.570
As per your request,
I have reserved

03:12.571 --> 03:14.929
the lakeside promenade
this evening for one hour,

03:14.930 --> 03:17.086
beginning at 5:00 P.M.,
for your memorial service.

03:17.088 --> 03:19.118
May I remind you that there's
no smoking on the grounds,

03:19.119 --> 03:21.333
no glass near the lake,
no feeding the ducks?

03:21.334 --> 03:23.199
- And I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.336
No feeding the ducks.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.090
What are you looking at me for?

03:34.417 --> 03:35.555
I love it here--

03:35.562 --> 03:36.704
manicured lawns,

03:36.705 --> 03:38.586
planned activities, early dinners.

03:38.587 --> 03:39.878
What more does a kid need?

03:39.880 --> 03:41.654
Oh, yeah. And everyone's
so polite and considerate--

03:41.655 --> 03:43.746
nothing like the constant
catfights in my circle,

03:43.747 --> 03:44.967
where every week,

03:44.968 --> 03:47.330
somebody's mad at somebody
for God knows who what,

03:47.331 --> 03:49.180
and I'm always thrown
into the middle.

03:49.264 --> 03:51.352
You seem tense. You know,
they have a steam room.

03:51.353 --> 03:53.221
- Wanna join me for a schvitz?
- Please, it's Florida.

03:53.222 --> 03:55.757
If I wanna sweat more, I'll just
move my arms. You go have fun.

03:56.655 --> 03:57.583
Hey, you.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.357
Are you liking that book?

03:59.358 --> 04:01.431
Well, it's not the worst thing
I've picked up at an airport,

04:01.431 --> 04:02.400
but close.

04:02.692 --> 04:03.639
What is this,

04:03.640 --> 04:05.609
a book club or
a Miss America Pageant?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.901
We're looking for our next book.

04:08.902 --> 04:09.871
Oh, what are you reading now?

04:09.871 --> 04:11.768
"Tempted by her innocent kiss."

04:12.256 --> 04:13.348
I-I'm sure you don't know it.

04:13.349 --> 04:15.860
Oh, please. Devon Carter
was Ashley's first,

04:15.900 --> 04:17.536
she wants their passion to last,

04:17.536 --> 04:19.875
but her hopes of true love
are crushed when she finds out

04:19.875 --> 04:22.595
their marriage is just another one
of daddy's business deals.

04:23.024 --> 04:23.945
I'm gay.

04:23.946 --> 04:25.955
Oh! My grandson is gay.

04:25.977 --> 04:28.696
His name is Daniel Schulman.
Uh, do you know him?

04:28.696 --> 04:31.865
Oh! Is he about this tall,
dark hair, circumcised?

04:33.346 --> 04:34.569
Terrible.

04:34.781 --> 04:36.187
All right, ladies. All right.

04:36.218 --> 04:39.427
You think we have room at our table
for a handsome young man?

04:39.456 --> 04:42.201
Well, let me know when he gets here,
and maybe I'll come back.

04:43.415 --> 04:44.980
Terrible little boy.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.586
Don't be nervous, all right?

04:47.586 --> 04:48.759
I'll explain your situation.

04:48.759 --> 04:49.901
We'll have you
out of here in no time.

04:50.021 --> 04:51.805
Okay, I've heard enough.

04:52.116 --> 04:54.808
The A.C.'s busted,
and I'm in this giant black Snuggie.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.171
$500 fine.

04:59.401 --> 05:01.626
- Keep the change.
- Keep the watch.

05:01.721 --> 05:03.719
30 days in county jail.

05:04.798 --> 05:07.207
What?
Ooh, she's tough.

05:07.623 --> 05:08.704
Next.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.784
Anita Menchaca.
Petty theft.

05:11.784 --> 05:12.697
Si.

05:13.092 --> 05:15.303
Mister, you're a lawyer?
Help me, please.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.688
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm her lawyer.

05:16.878 --> 05:19.513
No, no, help her,
so this will go faster.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.434
And she reminds me of my abuela,

05:21.436 --> 05:24.687
with her head scarf and
her petty theft charges.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.465
Here, your honor.

05:26.648 --> 05:28.955
I'm Mitchell Pritchett,
attorney to Miss Manchego.

05:28.956 --> 05:30.054
- Menchaca.
- Ah, yeah...

05:30.141 --> 05:31.554
Are you ready to enter a plea?

05:31.554 --> 05:32.655
Absolutely.

05:32.657 --> 05:34.283
I see no reason why
this matter should

05:34.283 --> 05:36.316
take up any more
of the court's valuable time.

05:36.706 --> 05:37.703
Not guilty, your honor.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.609
Why?

05:40.071 --> 05:41.311
Gonna need a minute.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.548
Look what my dad just gave me.

05:49.279 --> 05:50.826
Please tell me that's not your mom.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.594
No, no. She picked out her own urn.

05:53.065 --> 05:53.844
My dad keeps saying

05:53.873 --> 05:55.927
it's a size too small but
she squeezed into it.

05:57.046 --> 05:59.151
No, this is stuff
she left for the kids.

05:59.966 --> 06:01.538
Oh, that is sweet.

06:01.877 --> 06:03.606
Well, uh, should we take a look?

06:03.836 --> 06:05.288
- I guess so.
- Okay.

06:07.537 --> 06:09.256
Wow. There's a note for you.

06:09.361 --> 06:11.623
Really? She must have written it before she died.

06:11.652 --> 06:13.436
- Let's hope so.
- Would you, please?

06:15.229 --> 06:16.715
Yeah.

06:19.023 --> 06:19.753
Oh, boy.

06:19.809 --> 06:20.643
"Dear Phil,

06:20.672 --> 06:23.078
"you've always been
the most wonderful son,

06:23.208 --> 06:25.439
and now I need you to do
one last thing for me."

06:25.441 --> 06:26.222
Oh, no!

06:26.222 --> 06:28.886
She's gonna ask me to throw
her ashes in the Pope's face.

06:30.446 --> 06:31.979
"Don't say anything to your father

06:31.981 --> 06:33.447
"because he'll just resist,

06:33.449 --> 06:35.445
"but there's a woman
named Annie Fitzsimmons

06:35.447 --> 06:37.016
"who lives a few streets over.

06:37.016 --> 06:39.432
"We don't know her very well,
but I've always admired her,

06:39.432 --> 06:41.961
"and I think she'd
be perfect for your dad.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.824
So before you go home,
I want you to fix him up with her."

06:44.824 --> 06:45.908
That is crazy!

06:45.908 --> 06:47.331
"I know this sounds crazy,

06:47.509 --> 06:49.581
"but single men are
in short supply here.

06:49.603 --> 06:51.346
"And a lot of scheming
harpies will swoop in

06:51.346 --> 06:53.170
"before your father
knows what hit him.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.584
I love Frank, but he'll follow
anything with a casserole."

06:55.586 --> 06:57.052
I don't believe this.

06:57.423 --> 06:59.656
It's too soon, and
my dad's not a cartoon bear.

06:59.657 --> 07:02.364
He's perfectly capable
of making intelligent decisions.

07:02.364 --> 07:04.155
Hey, guys? I made cookies.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.909
Oh, good. I thought
that was a neighbor.

07:11.236 --> 07:14.027
Hey, kids, your grandma
left each of you something.

07:14.029 --> 07:15.541
Cool! Rockports!

07:15.542 --> 07:16.763
It's just the box.

07:18.632 --> 07:20.159
Oh, my God.
There's a letter.

07:20.294 --> 07:21.546
I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.731
Although if grandma wrote it,

07:22.731 --> 07:23.889
she must have sensed
I was ready.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.172
Because you had such a bond?

07:25.533 --> 07:26.350
You felt it, too?

07:26.350 --> 07:27.884
Haley, why don't you
tell us what yours says?

07:27.884 --> 07:29.095
Well, it's so sweet.

07:29.095 --> 07:31.364
It's about how beautiful
I am inside and--

07:31.365 --> 07:33.492
score! Jewelry

07:33.586 --> 07:34.828
Whoa! Check it out!

07:34.828 --> 07:35.756
Oh, look at that.

07:35.912 --> 07:37.562
Your grandma loved pocket watches.

07:37.562 --> 07:39.228
- Aw!
- She said they made a man look dignified.

07:39.230 --> 07:40.855
Is this chain in case
you swallow it?

07:40.855 --> 07:42.600
No, but suddenly
I'm glad it's there.

07:42.602 --> 07:45.211
- A lighter?
- Huh. What does the note say?

07:47.297 --> 07:48.413
"This is a lighter."

07:49.394 --> 07:50.649
I don't understand.

07:51.017 --> 07:52.647
How much clearer
could she have been?

07:52.695 --> 07:54.226
I wouldn't read too much into it.

07:54.226 --> 07:55.613
Your grandma loved you very much.

07:55.613 --> 07:58.406
She just did a couple of
bizarre things towards the end.

07:59.005 --> 08:00.995
Here, Alex, I can
help you out with that.

08:01.498 --> 08:03.529
You are getting very sleepy.

08:03.887 --> 08:06.608
A crappy old lighter
is not a sucky gift.

08:06.608 --> 08:09.861
Honey, hey, hey. So you're not
gonna do what your mom asked?

08:09.863 --> 08:11.829
Marry off my dad
to a complete stranger

08:11.829 --> 08:13.527
on the day of her funeral?
I think not.

08:13.529 --> 08:14.833
It was her last wish.

08:14.835 --> 08:17.467
When my dad is ready,
he gets to pick his own girlfriend.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.244
That's the big upside
to your wife dying.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.540
Also, not having to think
before you speak.

08:22.542 --> 08:23.477
Yeah.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.730
Your honor, it all
boils down to this.

08:26.732 --> 08:28.982
The motel owes
Miss Menchengo--

08:28.982 --> 08:30.458
- Menchaca.
- Damn it. Every time.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.674
More in wages than
she ever could've taken

08:32.676 --> 08:34.986
in soaps and tiny shampoos.

08:34.986 --> 08:36.628
Fine. Case dismissed.

08:36.630 --> 08:37.645
Yes!

08:38.818 --> 08:40.489
Oh! Gracias! Muchas gracias!

08:40.491 --> 08:41.967
- De nada. De nada.
- Muchas gracias.

08:41.970 --> 08:45.156
Did you see that? I won!
I-I can't believe it!

08:45.157 --> 08:47.694
Yeah. It scares me that winning
is such a surprise for you.

08:47.939 --> 08:51.834
Next! Matthew Plonkser.
Parking violations.

08:51.993 --> 08:54.777
I thought I'd be a little rusty,
but apparently not.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.452
Oh! Really? Sweet.

08:58.488 --> 09:00.438
Yes! Go make your
mistakes with him.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.390
I don't want to go
to jail for prostitution.

09:05.055 --> 09:06.638
Like you could afford me.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.985
It seems to me
it wasn't only the meter

09:08.987 --> 09:11.503
that was broken
that fateful afternoon.

09:11.504 --> 09:12.495
Nay!

09:13.122 --> 09:15.450
It was the entire
criminal justice system.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.465
Therefore I submit to you,

09:18.004 --> 09:20.524
the only "influence" my client
was under that night

09:20.565 --> 09:22.452
was his love of boating.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.518
Shame!

09:28.181 --> 09:30.411
I just don't get it.
Why would she give me a lighter?

09:30.581 --> 09:32.525
Maybe she wants you
to burn all your clothes.

09:33.217 --> 09:35.488
Is it possible we didn't have
the connection I thought we did?

09:35.902 --> 09:37.918
I don't know.
You heard dad.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.019
She was on all that medication
towards the end.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.245
People do weird things
when they're on drugs.

09:42.460 --> 09:44.634
When Dylan was on Vicodin
after his root canal,

09:44.635 --> 09:47.851
he bought the complete DVD set
of "Dr. Quinn medicine woman."

09:51.610 --> 09:53.787
Get going, ladies.
The pool's for residents only.

09:53.788 --> 09:55.419
Oh, okay. Sorry. We'll leave.

09:55.421 --> 09:57.424
Uh, no, we won't.
There's nobody here.

09:57.425 --> 09:59.295
- Haley!
- Why can't we use the pool?

09:59.297 --> 10:00.923
Because those are the rules.

10:01.086 --> 10:02.582
Are we gonna have a problem here?

10:02.582 --> 10:05.670
You don't scare me
I've been in real jail.

10:05.951 --> 10:08.106
Oh, you two are
pretty smart, aren't you?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.845
No. Only she is.

10:14.869 --> 10:15.851
North.

10:15.904 --> 10:16.871
Flowers.

10:16.970 --> 10:17.898
Red.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.076
One dot.

10:20.846 --> 10:21.815
Two bam.

10:23.565 --> 10:24.910
I have mahj!

10:24.935 --> 10:26.511
- Hee hee!
- Again?!

10:26.732 --> 10:28.693
Wow, you're really
on some streak, Edith.

10:28.851 --> 10:30.203
Luck of the tiles.

10:30.623 --> 10:32.439
Anyone else want some punch?

10:33.189 --> 10:34.487
Yeah. I'll join you.

10:39.142 --> 10:40.929
- You are very good.
- Well...

10:40.929 --> 10:43.418
Where'd a farm boy like you
learn to play mahjong?

10:43.429 --> 10:44.752
Oh, well, one summer,

10:44.753 --> 10:46.454
I worked at the central
Missouri b'Nai b'rith.

10:46.455 --> 10:48.623
It's the nation's smallest chapter.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.344
Listen, Marilyn,

10:50.344 --> 10:52.310
I don't mean to stir things up,

10:52.310 --> 10:56.574
but I just saw Edith take the winning
tile out of her jacket pocket.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.185
I knew it!

10:58.186 --> 10:59.406
Nobody's that good!

11:00.113 --> 11:02.761
Do you have any idea how much money
I have lost to her in the past year?

11:02.791 --> 11:04.465
Gotta be $10, $12.

11:04.496 --> 11:05.609
Listen, I'm as shocked as you are.

11:05.611 --> 11:07.689
It just doesn't seem like Edith.

11:07.690 --> 11:11.002
Yeah, well, it goes to show,
you think you know someone...

11:16.215 --> 11:19.527
Hey. What happened
to all the cookies?

11:19.604 --> 11:21.907
Oh, well, you know
I hate to stir things up...

11:25.341 --> 11:26.816
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

11:26.816 --> 11:29.894
Jay Pritchett. Frank Dunphy's son
is married to my daughter.

11:29.896 --> 11:31.094
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:31.095 --> 11:32.558
Ah, he grows on you.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.892
Oh, you're talking about
the death. Thank you.

11:35.185 --> 11:39.130
You look very familiar to me.
Did you ever live in Ohio?

11:39.955 --> 11:42.299
No. I'm from Pensacola.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.177
And then it hit me.

11:44.244 --> 11:47.125
I had done my basic
training in Pensacola.

11:47.245 --> 11:48.677
She was my first.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.855
I'll never forget her--
Charlotte somebody.

11:50.870 --> 11:53.086
I was 18, and she was 31.

11:53.549 --> 11:55.711
And we fell pretty hard
for each other.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.411
I always felt bad
I never called her

11:57.412 --> 11:58.683
when I got back from Vietnam.

11:59.054 --> 12:01.624
Especially because by then I had,
you know...

12:02.241 --> 12:03.545
learned a few things.

12:04.054 --> 12:05.765
I'm sorry.
You'll have to forgive me.

12:05.765 --> 12:07.313
My memory isn't what it used to be.

12:07.632 --> 12:09.435
- Was I your teacher?
- In a way.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.168
I was in the Navy.
Jay Pritchett.

12:13.531 --> 12:14.924
Little more up here,

12:15.088 --> 12:16.164
little less down here.

12:16.165 --> 12:17.703
I'm sure you're a very nice man,

12:17.704 --> 12:20.991
but I-I think you may have
mistaken me for someone else.

12:21.130 --> 12:22.233
I was shipping off to Vietnam.

12:22.235 --> 12:24.129
You had the ass of
a young Ann-Margret.

12:24.237 --> 12:25.374
Yeah, that was me.

12:26.048 --> 12:28.138
So the watch goes in your pocket like so.

12:28.169 --> 12:30.747
And the chain, or fob, attaches
to a belt loop. And voila'.

12:32.131 --> 12:34.703
You just said fob and voila'
in the same sentence.

12:34.808 --> 12:35.881
Pace yourself.

12:36.761 --> 12:38.425
Grandma looks so happy here.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.626
Yeah. We were pretty hammered.

12:41.592 --> 12:44.448
That was last 4th of July--
grandma's favorite holiday.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.883
The Plimptons had a barbecue,

12:46.892 --> 12:49.545
and gram and I got a little tipsy
on ginger margaritas.

12:49.545 --> 12:51.664
We came home for a catnap

12:51.809 --> 12:53.869
and slept right through
the big fireworks show.

12:54.205 --> 12:55.613
First one she ever missed.

12:56.133 --> 12:57.333
Boy, was she mad.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.639
I made it up to her

12:58.641 --> 13:00.766
with a little fireworks show
of our own later.

13:00.767 --> 13:01.761
Grandpa!

13:01.945 --> 13:05.078
A couple of glow sticks and
a slingshot in the backyard.

13:06.862 --> 13:09.437
Which led to some pretty
memorable lovemaking.

13:10.984 --> 13:13.017
Not to change the subject,

13:13.189 --> 13:15.441
but I don't really get
the gift grandma left me.

13:15.443 --> 13:17.234
Well, didn't she explain
it in the note?

13:17.353 --> 13:19.201
No. The note's four words.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.310
You know it opens, right?

13:22.748 --> 13:23.683
It does?

13:24.111 --> 13:27.800
Sure. Look, it's Florida.
Everything sticks together.

13:31.619 --> 13:32.788
It's all so weird.

13:33.565 --> 13:35.044
- Mm. - This thing you dread
in the back of your mind

13:35.046 --> 13:36.470
suddenly becomes real.

13:36.509 --> 13:37.470
I know.

13:38.464 --> 13:40.070
I feel better having
you here, though.

13:40.071 --> 13:41.566
Oh, I'm always here for you.

13:42.676 --> 13:43.788
Look at that house.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.191
That is a cute house.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.679
I wonder who lives there.

13:47.196 --> 13:48.125
I don't know.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.064
Claire, what are you doing?

13:51.066 --> 13:52.333
I love this house.

13:52.335 --> 13:54.398
I bet you anything I would love
whoever lives here.

13:54.399 --> 13:55.019
Wait a minute.

13:55.019 --> 13:56.891
That lady from my mom's letter
lives here, doesn't she?

13:56.893 --> 13:58.053
Annie Fitzsimmons.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.370
Phil, listen to me.

13:59.519 --> 14:01.697
You may have your reasons
for not wanting to do this,

14:01.698 --> 14:04.265
but your mother was
a very wise woman.

14:04.266 --> 14:06.634
She believed that whoever
is behind that door

14:06.745 --> 14:09.313
would make your father happy
for the rest of his life.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.559
Yeah. What can I do for you?

14:13.140 --> 14:14.308
She's perfect.

14:14.615 --> 14:16.137
I thought Annie Fitzsimmons
lived here.

14:16.139 --> 14:18.259
She does.
Annie, honey!

14:18.262 --> 14:19.847
There's people here to see ya!

14:20.121 --> 14:21.770
- Who is it?
- Who are you?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.680
Yes, Claire, who are we?

14:24.236 --> 14:25.794
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:25.794 --> 14:26.890
Can I help you?

14:27.477 --> 14:28.892
We're selling vacuum cleaners.

14:28.894 --> 14:30.494
Wow. That is strange.

14:30.524 --> 14:31.150
I know.

14:31.151 --> 14:33.800
Because just this morning,
my vacuum cleaner broke.

14:33.802 --> 14:36.392
- Huh.
- That's on me. I shed like a collie.

14:36.649 --> 14:37.516
Let's see what you got.

14:37.517 --> 14:39.085
Yes, Claire,
let's see what you got.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.659
I didn't bring it.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.638
- You didn't bring it?
- No.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.906
You had it when we left
the vacuum cleaner office.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.704
I guess it's fair to say
you've made a huge mistake.

14:47.776 --> 14:49.704
- Mm.
- No. Say it.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.734
I'm sorry to do that.
It's part of the training.

14:52.354 --> 14:54.219
I've made a huge mistake.

14:55.885 --> 14:57.646
I don't think she's gonna work out.

15:03.617 --> 15:06.047
- That's mahj again!
- Oh! Well, shocker.

15:06.086 --> 15:08.224
- That's it. You're cheating.
- I am not.

15:08.225 --> 15:12.306
Oh, please! You've stashed more tiles
than Marilyn has cookies!

15:12.839 --> 15:14.517
Oh! O-okay.
Uh, let's just take a breath.

15:14.518 --> 15:16.435
Who cares about tiles or cookies

15:16.435 --> 15:18.570
or whatever Hattie's
slipping into her coffee?

15:18.730 --> 15:20.134
I knew you were drinking again!

15:20.136 --> 15:22.729
- That's how she lost her license.
- You shut your traps!

15:22.730 --> 15:23.754
- Drop dead!
- Screw you!

15:23.756 --> 15:24.689
- Yeah, you, too!
- Ladies.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.081
- And you!
- Ladies.

15:26.332 --> 15:27.893
- Stop it! Stop it.
- You--

15:27.894 --> 15:29.672
You have been friends
for 20 years.

15:29.672 --> 15:32.402
What on earth has
gotten into you all?

15:33.710 --> 15:36.843
Why does drama keep
following me everywhere I go?

15:36.844 --> 15:39.066
It just keeps popping up
out of nowhere.

15:39.343 --> 15:40.847
Like Crispin's hair plugs.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.927
And so we went
to your apartment.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.769
It's still embarrassing.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.760
I told you I had never
been with a woman.

15:48.436 --> 15:51.116
And you took me by the hand
and you led me into the bedroom.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.878
You were so sweet and beautiful.

15:53.308 --> 15:54.819
I thought I'd gone to heaven.

15:55.461 --> 15:58.303
- Jay Pritchett.
- Yes! Yes!

15:58.304 --> 15:59.991
Oh! I remember that.

16:00.956 --> 16:03.577
- Oh, it was a perfect night.
- It was!

16:03.850 --> 16:05.577
And the next day I went to Vietnam.

16:05.606 --> 16:08.312
But the memory of our night
together kept me going.

16:08.937 --> 16:10.759
Because I wasn't a boy anymore.

16:11.129 --> 16:12.360
I was a man.

16:12.673 --> 16:14.067
You were so handsome.

16:14.221 --> 16:15.597
Ohh! I don't know about that.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.765
I mean, cute, maybe. I--
People talk about my eyes.

16:18.054 --> 16:21.610
But I always regretted
not getting in touch with you

16:21.611 --> 16:22.701
when I got back,

16:22.702 --> 16:25.422
because you had given me
something that I cherished

16:25.722 --> 16:27.396
for almost 50 years.

16:27.797 --> 16:29.669
You gave me something, too.

16:29.966 --> 16:30.891
I did?

16:30.892 --> 16:32.289
You wait right there.

16:33.223 --> 16:34.656
I'm down there for a funeral--

16:34.658 --> 16:36.140
it's such a sad event--

16:36.482 --> 16:39.449
and I end up finding something
that I thought was lost forever.

16:39.553 --> 16:42.920
This beautiful moment that meant
so much to both of us,

16:42.997 --> 16:45.354
set against the backdrop
of fighting commies.

16:46.146 --> 16:47.251
There's your movie.

16:48.099 --> 16:50.204
I've kept it all these years.

16:50.475 --> 16:53.756
I remember exactly where I was
when you gave it to me.

16:54.525 --> 16:56.032
You said, "wear this bec--"

16:56.034 --> 16:57.545
No, no. This isn't mine.

16:57.872 --> 16:59.487
And I never went
to Jefferson High.

16:59.741 --> 17:01.916
Oh. My mistake.

17:02.656 --> 17:03.863
Ah! Here it is.

17:04.605 --> 17:06.989
- You said, "pin this--"
- No, no. N-no. Never got a medal.

17:07.771 --> 17:08.638
And, uh...

17:09.390 --> 17:11.188
this is the wrong
branch of service.

17:11.663 --> 17:12.589
Of course.

17:13.619 --> 17:14.654
These are th--

17:14.655 --> 17:15.753
Never wrote.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.477
Why don't you look through here?

17:20.289 --> 17:23.599
Turns out she sent more men
off to war than Lyndon Johnson.

17:25.233 --> 17:25.973
Well, we're here.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.753
You wanna try to sell
my dad a vacuum?

17:27.755 --> 17:28.875
Tease me all you want.

17:28.876 --> 17:30.452
I am glad that we at least tried.

17:30.453 --> 17:32.956
I know you mean well,
but he's gonna be fine on his own.

17:33.283 --> 17:34.514
So funny.

17:35.391 --> 17:37.293
Ooh! Here.
Try mine, Frank.

17:37.294 --> 17:38.750
- Oh! I bet it's delicious.
- Mmm.

17:38.751 --> 17:40.226
If your taste buds are dead.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.705
Dead? Real sensitive, Myra.

17:41.706 --> 17:44.148
The woman's not even cold...
unlike your eggplant parm.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.676
What is going on?

17:45.713 --> 17:48.020
Oh, it's a feeding frenzy.
They're all over him.

17:48.021 --> 17:49.814
They're practically measuring
the windows for new drapes.

17:49.815 --> 17:50.838
It's disgusting.

17:50.839 --> 17:52.857
I must get this recipe, Myra.

17:52.858 --> 17:53.664
Oh, sure.

17:53.665 --> 17:55.978
You want the recipe?
It's thaw, heat, and serve.

17:55.979 --> 17:59.005
My mom was right.
They're gonna eat him alive.

17:59.006 --> 17:59.925
Do you think we can break up

17:59.926 --> 18:01.726
- Annie Fitzsimmons and her boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

18:01.727 --> 18:04.969
Oh, you mean Marv?
Oh, that's hilarious. Oh!

18:05.370 --> 18:07.474
Marv's her brother,
visiting from Pompano.

18:07.475 --> 18:08.318
He's here for the week,

18:08.319 --> 18:10.303
slept with half
the women in this place.

18:10.363 --> 18:12.060
She's single? This is fantastic.

18:12.061 --> 18:13.264
Cam, how do you know that?

18:13.265 --> 18:15.104
This place is lousy with gossips.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.581
Next.
Gloria Delgado?

18:18.582 --> 18:19.503
I'm here!

18:19.508 --> 18:22.952
Conspiring to promote prostitution.
How do you plead?

18:22.954 --> 18:25.766
- Not guilty, your honor.
- Oh, good. It's you.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.763
Your majesty.
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:28.764 --> 18:30.657
But I will say that I am guilty

18:30.658 --> 18:32.993
if I can just pay
the fine and go home.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.125
No, you won't.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.148
All right, how about this?

18:35.178 --> 18:37.363
You plead guilty, and I'll waive the the fine...

18:37.393 --> 18:39.193
if it will just get us the hell out of here.

18:39.224 --> 18:40.513
No deal. Not guilty.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.922
Mitchell, stop. She hates you and
she's gonna take it out on me.

18:44.046 --> 18:45.705
You're innocent,
and I can prove it.

18:45.706 --> 18:48.024
Your honor,
this document here shows

18:48.025 --> 18:50.860
that my client was a resident
of California at the time.

18:50.861 --> 18:52.603
And these canceled checks prove

18:52.604 --> 18:55.260
that she was legally subletting
the apartment in question.

18:55.764 --> 18:58.389
I might be a simple man,
but I do know one thing...

18:58.866 --> 19:00.275
If a dog don't bark--

19:00.276 --> 19:02.126
Okay, I can't listen
to him anymore.

19:02.128 --> 19:04.922
Case dismissed. Court adjourned.

19:05.389 --> 19:07.836
- Oh!
- Ah! Gracias, Mitchell! You're wonderful!

19:08.788 --> 19:12.116
You know what? We got lucky because
I had no ending to that dog thing.

19:12.334 --> 19:14.116
If you don't have
anything to do next week,

19:14.117 --> 19:16.796
maybe you can go with me to Texas.

19:18.735 --> 19:19.470
Hello again.

19:19.471 --> 19:21.408
Oh, no. You're alone.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.344
Did you fire that nice girl?

19:23.345 --> 19:25.893
No. She's not a nice girl.
She's my wife.

19:25.894 --> 19:27.412
And we don't sell vacuums.

19:27.412 --> 19:29.206
Thank God. You'd starve.

19:30.748 --> 19:32.597
U-um, I-I-I'm actually Phil Dunphy.

19:32.598 --> 19:34.568
I-I'm Frank and Grace Dunphy's son.

19:34.569 --> 19:37.435
Oh, I heard about your mom.
I'm--I'm so sorry.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.309
Thank you.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.144
I only met her a few times,

19:40.145 --> 19:42.450
but she seemed like
a lovely woman.

19:43.736 --> 19:45.695
Mm, but I'm still confused.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.040
Well, this probably
won't help, but, um...

19:50.585 --> 19:55.209
Her last request was for me
to fix you up with my dad.

19:55.830 --> 19:57.006
Oh, my.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.776
Yeah. I really wish
I sold vacuums.

19:59.963 --> 20:01.099
So earlier...

20:01.448 --> 20:03.372
We were thrown when your brother
answered the door.

20:03.373 --> 20:05.077
We thought he was your boyfriend.

20:05.420 --> 20:08.487
I know this whole thing sounds so crazy,
but you have to know my mom.

20:08.517 --> 20:10.234
She just loved my dad so much.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.183
And, uh, she didn't want him to be alone.

20:13.431 --> 20:15.205
I don't know what to say.

20:16.201 --> 20:19.362
Really? This is such
a-a normal request I'm making.

20:19.581 --> 20:21.982
Please, by the way,
don't feel pressured at all.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.020
My dad doesn't even
know about this.

20:24.269 --> 20:27.238
I-I just--I had to tell you.
It's what she wanted.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.501
She was always doing
crazy stuff like this...

20:29.753 --> 20:32.665
Going out of her way
to take care of us.

20:34.319 --> 20:36.823
I coughed on the phone once,
and she overnighted me soup.

20:37.642 --> 20:40.103
When I wanted to learn how to ski,
she knit me a sweater.

20:41.725 --> 20:43.204
When I wanted to be
a marine biologist,

20:43.205 --> 20:45.222
she knit me a sweater
with a whale on it.

20:47.984 --> 20:49.071
Who does that?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.885
That's just the kind
of person she is.

20:53.358 --> 20:54.319
Was.

20:54.685 --> 20:55.934
Oh, sweetie.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.619
You're a good son.

21:01.422 --> 21:03.702
She was right.
You are very nice.

21:15.538 --> 21:16.605
It's a beautiful service.

21:16.606 --> 21:19.109
It really makes you think about
how you wanna live your life.

21:20.147 --> 21:22.263
I wanna quit my job and
get back into the courtroom.

21:22.264 --> 21:23.199
What?

21:23.361 --> 21:25.051
Yeah. Just--just don't say
anything to anyone.

21:25.052 --> 21:26.461
Well, who am I gonna tell?

21:30.485 --> 21:34.754
I can apply for my citizenship
as soon as I clear up things in Texas.

21:34.784 --> 21:36.689
- Good for you.
- And Arizona.

21:38.851 --> 21:40.043
Thank you, Mel.

21:40.601 --> 21:41.634
That was beautiful.

21:45.108 --> 21:46.695
Um, before we say good night,

21:46.696 --> 21:49.511
my daughter Alex
would like to pay tribute.

21:52.765 --> 21:53.870
Thanks, sweetie.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.563
My grandmother and I
had a very special bond.

22:03.604 --> 22:05.140
Seriously? Again?

22:05.328 --> 22:07.168
This may not make
sense to everyone,

22:07.767 --> 22:09.575
but I'm pretty sure
she would've loved it.

22:21.663 --> 22:22.735
"This is a lighter.

22:23.823 --> 22:26.439
"It belonged to my favorite actor,
Paul Newman.

22:26.796 --> 22:29.204
"One day, he came into the restaurant
where I was waitressing

22:29.205 --> 22:30.865
"and accidentally left it behind.

22:31.426 --> 22:33.007
"For the first time in my life,

22:33.323 --> 22:34.915
"I did something
I wasn't supposed to

22:34.916 --> 22:36.541
and slipped it into my pocket."

22:37.497 --> 22:38.919
"One of the customers saw

22:38.920 --> 22:41.399
"and said, 'don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

22:41.971 --> 22:44.459
"That customer turned out
to be the love of my life,

22:44.936 --> 22:46.051
"your grandfather.

22:46.537 --> 22:48.981
"So, my Alex,
who I love so dearly,

22:48.983 --> 22:51.342
"who is probably too much
like me for her own good,

22:52.190 --> 22:53.468
"every once in a while,

22:53.469 --> 22:55.318
"don't be afraid to break the rules.

22:56.343 --> 22:57.564
You never know what can happen."

22:59.815 --> 23:01.928
Hey! No fireworks allowed!

23:02.270 --> 23:04.985
- You know what? Arrest me.
- Mitchell, help her.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.439
- I got this.
- He's quitting his job.

23:13.971 --> 23:15.077
How 'bout this weather?

23:15.696 --> 23:18.135
Yep. They say
it's supposed to rain.

23:18.375 --> 23:19.326
We need it.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.450
Muriel.

23:21.010 --> 23:23.473
Hey! Are you two packed up
and ready to go?

23:23.475 --> 23:24.507
Yep.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.816
Where does the time go?

23:27.171 --> 23:28.372
Darned if I know.

23:28.771 --> 23:30.604
Everyone's always in such a hurry.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.185
And why? We're all gonna
end up in the same place.

23:34.951 --> 23:36.631
Well, I guess we better mosey.
