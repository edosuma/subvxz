00:01.959 --> 00:04.125
(Jimmy imitates engine revving,
Edie laughs)

00:04.208 --> 00:05.417
You know why I like you, Edie?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.959
Because we have
so much in common.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.959
We both love to curl up
with a good book and learn, huh?

00:10.041 --> 00:11.875
Any good suggestions?
I...

00:11.959 --> 00:13.166
Let me see that.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.834
<i>The Toad and the Turtle.</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:15.834
Oh, they're in a car.

00:15.917 --> 00:16.834
Very<i> On the Road. </i>

00:16.917 --> 00:17.959
You're so smart.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.250
You see that, Edie?
You see that?

00:22.333 --> 00:24.208
I turned and smiled
right at that pretty girl.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.750
You know why?
Because I'm back.

00:25.834 --> 00:26.917
Back.
I'm strong.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.667
I'm back. I'm strong.
Strong!

00:28.750 --> 00:30.250
That's right.
I strong!

00:30.333 --> 00:31.792
I'm strong.

00:31.875 --> 00:33.208
Can I tell you a
secret? Come here.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.166
There may have been
a moment recently

00:35.250 --> 00:40.166
when I thought that me and your
grandma had a little spark.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.875
Now Sara's seeing
some hacky musician.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.208
Real derivative,
not our type at all.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.083
But you know, I'm
happy for her.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.583
The only thing we
have in common is a kid

00:49.667 --> 00:52.083
and a grandkid and
a family and...

00:52.166 --> 00:54.083
Grandma.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.792
Grandma. Mama.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.583
as a grandma
to get over her.
Grandma.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.709
An old lady with
a great body.
Grandma,
Grandma, Grandma.

00:59.792 --> 01:01.917
Oh. There you are.
Hi.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.709
Ooh, Edie,
this is a special day.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.917
You are about to meet a woman
who broke the glass ceiling

01:06.000 --> 01:08.250
in the male-dominated business
world to become the CEO

01:08.333 --> 01:09.917
of a Fortune 500 company:
Catherine Sanders.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.125
JIMMY:
That's right, Edie.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.083
Women can break
glass ceilings, too.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.667
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:14.750 --> 01:15.917
Catherine's doing her
book signing over there.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.375
And fear not.
I've come prepared.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.166
Eh, what's the big deal?
She's a CEO.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.709
Big whoop.
I'm a CEO of Jimmy's.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.500
You don't see me
bragging about it.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.959
You brag about it constantly.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.625
And Catherine Sanders is
so much more than a CEO.

01:28.709 --> 01:31.000
She's the first African-American
woman to sit on five

01:31.083 --> 01:32.959
Fortune 500 boards.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.959
She has 1.2 million Instagram
followers, and she...

01:35.041 --> 01:36.792
Okay. Great. That's solid.

01:36.875 --> 01:39.625
Hey, listen, all right?
If my first marker fails,

01:39.709 --> 01:42.625
I'll say "Hit me," and you
hand me the second one, cap off.

01:42.709 --> 01:44.750
Catherine Sanders is not
a woman who wastes time.

01:44.834 --> 01:46.542
Chapter nine.

01:46.625 --> 01:50.083
Why do I care about
meeting some female...

01:50.166 --> 01:52.208
Thank you.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.959
Hot. She's hot.
Okay.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.792
(Edie jabbers)

01:56.875 --> 01:58.917
Catherine Sanders.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.709
God! Hit me!
Hit me!
What?

02:01.792 --> 02:04.500
I'm just gonna go get that
real fast over here.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.000
So, do you have a marker?

02:06.083 --> 02:08.875
Oh, yes, in fact, I do.
I do have one.

02:08.959 --> 02:11.333
So, who should I make this out
to? Catherine with a "C?"

02:11.417 --> 02:14.959
(humming whimsically)

02:15.041 --> 02:16.500
Hmm.
There you are.

02:16.583 --> 02:18.208
Well, this is a first.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.834
(laughs)
"Reach for the stars."

02:20.917 --> 02:23.083
Well, thank you
for the free advice.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.333
Who said it was free? Hmm?

02:25.417 --> 02:29.333
I am not sure if I really like
you, or really dislike you.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.000
Gotten that before.
Let's go with "like."

02:31.083 --> 02:32.458
I think it's more fun.

02:32.542 --> 02:34.458
Well, the signing
is all about, uh,

02:34.542 --> 02:36.709
Jerry Martini having fun,
isn't it?

02:36.792 --> 02:38.333
Look, I know
you're a woman who doesn't like

02:38.417 --> 02:39.875
to waste time-- chapter nine.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.250
So let me be direct.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.208
You intrigue me.

02:43.291 --> 02:45.000
Well, if we're being direct,

02:45.083 --> 02:46.917
should we just get it on
right now in the travel section?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.667
Beats the do-it-yourself
section.
(laughing)

02:49.750 --> 02:51.542
Found it. (laughs)
Sorry about him.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.500
Uh, Gerald,
classic spelling.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.041
Listen, I know
you think that

02:56.125 --> 02:59.500
you're cute-- which you are--
but you're holding up my line.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.041
Well, perhaps we should
pick this up later over dinner?

03:02.125 --> 03:04.458
I, too, am a CEO
of a popular restaurant.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.125
Here's my card.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.625

03:07.709 --> 03:10.041
I'm not giving you my number.

But you can wait for me
over there, and when I'm done

03:12.125 --> 03:13.458

I will come say hi.

Now we're even for when you took
Edie to see<i> The Hateful Eight. </i>

08:38.375 --> 08:39.667
Jimmy, this Wi-Fi password

08:39.750 --> 08:41.166
is not gonna work for me.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.667
I can't remember
all the numbers.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.750
Password stays. 908746527
is my lucky number.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.959
But I love the confidence.
You remind me of a young

08:48.041 --> 08:49.417
Catherine Sanders.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.125
Oh, yeah, yeah.
How'd the big date go?

08:51.208 --> 08:52.583
Was it as sexy as
her<i> New Yorker </i>piece

08:52.667 --> 08:54.667
on gender bias
in the tech space?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.667
Well, it was nice,
but it was a little weird.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.667
I mean, she paid
for the check.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.375
I mean, and not just like
pretend to grab it

09:00.458 --> 09:02.709
and then stick me for the bill.
She got it, and she paid it.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.500
Do you know
they have a Purple Card?

09:04.583 --> 09:06.208
I have an MMA Superfan card.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.625
Spend 20K in a year, you get to
take a picture in The Octagon.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.375
Oh, yeah?
Boom.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.125
Welcome
to the chocolate factory.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.417
(electricity buzzing)

09:16.500 --> 09:18.083
Fixer-upper.
This blows.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.792
Hey, free is free.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.000
Oh, if the health inspector
comes in,<i> no hablo inglés. </i>

09:23.083 --> 09:24.709
But, no, this...
this could work, right?

09:24.792 --> 09:26.125
You know, if we put
the printer over there,

09:26.208 --> 09:28.417
and the bookcase over
by that asbestos.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.792
Incoming!

09:32.500 --> 09:33.709
(groaning)

09:33.792 --> 09:35.709
So much milk.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.625
(sighs)
Glad to say good-bye to that.

09:37.709 --> 09:38.792
(laughs)

09:38.875 --> 09:40.083
All right.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.500
(Ravi whistling happily)

09:42.583 --> 09:44.542
(electricity buzzing)

09:44.625 --> 09:48.000
Uh, maybe this is stupid,
but I always thought

09:48.083 --> 09:52.375
that having a real office meant
I was on the right track.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.917
Like something you'd see
in Silicon Beach

09:54.000 --> 09:58.625
with glass desks, and dorks
riding around on hoverboards.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.041
Growing up, I never thought

10:00.125 --> 10:01.750
it was possible
for someone like me,

10:01.834 --> 10:04.375
and neither did anyone else.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.041
With this app--
which is short for application--

10:07.125 --> 10:09.667
I felt maybe it was, but...

10:09.750 --> 10:11.542
maybe not.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.834
Hey, we'll find
something better.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.458
Hmm.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.750
Thank you.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.750
What's the Wi-Fi
password again?

10:19.834 --> 10:21.750
908746527.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.291
Wow.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.875
Can you text me? I think
the cell towers are down.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.291
Not buying it. Try again.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.792
Guess the towers aren't down.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.792
I texted Catherine,
like, two hours ago,

10:39.875 --> 10:41.417
and she hasn't
texted me back.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.250
Who does that?

10:43.333 --> 10:44.709
I don't need that tone.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.250
It's just confusing, because

10:46.333 --> 10:47.792
we had such a great time,

10:47.875 --> 10:49.959
and she-she gets
my brand of comedy,

10:50.041 --> 10:51.500
our bedroom demeanor
was playful,

10:51.583 --> 10:53.166
yet it had a
hint of danger.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.542
It's unbeliev... I don't
need this. I don't need her.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.375
I've got plenty of
girls right here.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.834
Good-bye, Catherine, hello...

11:00.917 --> 11:02.709
Funny Sandwich Girl.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.083
(phone dings)

11:04.166 --> 11:06.417
Ah! Aha, ha-ha!
I knew she couldn't stay away.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.625
You know, first it was a tone,
now it's a look.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.333
What look?
This is just my face.

11:12.417 --> 11:13.917
I know what you think--
you-you think that she has me

11:14.000 --> 11:15.917
in the palm of her hand.
Well, let me tell you something.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
Every once in a while, it's nice

11:17.583 --> 11:20.041
to be on the receiving end
of a frittata.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.625
Whew! Boy! I know
you didn't sleep your way

11:23.709 --> 11:25.291
to the top,
but you definitely could have.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.792
You know, that
was only 70%.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.750
Really?

11:28.834 --> 11:30.709
I was a bit distracted by
the Japanese bank crisis.

11:30.792 --> 11:31.834
(chuckles)

11:31.917 --> 11:33.834
You know, I know
this may sound crazy,

11:33.917 --> 11:35.000
but I-I think I may be able

11:35.083 --> 11:36.917
to go again
in, like, ten seconds.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.834
Well, now,

11:38.917 --> 11:41.667
i-if we're standing
I'm gonna need about 20.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.625
Ooh! Downstairs sex. I'm in.

11:44.709 --> 11:47.166
As tempting as that sounds,

11:47.250 --> 11:48.834
I have this thing
in the morning.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.709
Oh.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.500
And if you stay,

11:52.583 --> 11:54.875
I am gonna want to go again.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.291
And again.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.417
And again.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.041
Well, I have that
effect on women.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.125
Yes, you do.
(chuckles)

12:03.208 --> 12:04.875
Bye.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.208
(door locks)

12:06.291 --> 12:08.041
Wait, how the hell
did I get out here?

12:08.417 --> 12:10.583
Not even a frittata this time?

12:13.583 --> 12:15.500
I'd like to personally
thank all of you for coming in

12:15.583 --> 12:17.667
an hour and a half early. Now, I
don't know if you've observed me

12:17.750 --> 12:20.458
over the last few days, but,
uh, recently, I am tangled up

12:20.542 --> 12:23.375
into a romantic game of chess,
and it's my move.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.458
I recuse myself.
Checkers guy.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.458
See, now, I don't know what
it's like to be the weak one

12:27.542 --> 12:30.000
in the relationship-- that's
where all you come in handy.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.542
Ah.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.542
I'm honestly not
trying to be difficult,

12:33.625 --> 12:34.709
but I'm in a tank top.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.125
Ooh, I got something.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.500
The big guy.

12:37.583 --> 12:38.542
I was dating that traffic cop...

12:38.625 --> 12:40.500
Next.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.667
I just play it super cool
and blow her off right back.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.458
Trust me, she is all over me
the rest of the night.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.542
Now we're going somewhere.

12:46.625 --> 12:47.583
How long have you and Grace
been together?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.667
Well, I rescued her
as a kitten in '09...

12:49.750 --> 12:51.000
Although
who rescued who, right?

12:51.083 --> 12:53.542
Grace is a cat?
Dude, come on, man.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.542
He's never gonna
come to us for advice again.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.250
No, actually, while
that glimpse into CJ's life

12:58.333 --> 12:59.417
was wildly disturbing,

12:59.500 --> 13:00.792
it's got me thinking.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.291
See, maybe I'm trying
too hard with Catherine.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.792
I need to blow her
off a little bit.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.542
Annelise, what do you got
for the rest of the day?

13:06.625 --> 13:08.542
I was planning on ramming my
head into a wall with no helmet.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.041
Well, cancel 'em all,

13:10.125 --> 13:12.041
because I've been struck
by inspiration.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.125
Now, we'll need sweatpants...
and popcorn.

13:15.208 --> 13:18.583
And somehow, some way, we've
got to make me look unkempt.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.625
Now, come on, let's go.

13:19.709 --> 13:20.834
Let's go.

13:20.917 --> 13:23.667
Not you.
Chill out, guys.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.583
So I had to pull some strings
to get this reservation,

13:26.667 --> 13:29.250
but I think it's
gonna be worth it.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.500
Six-course tasting menu

13:31.583 --> 13:32.834
and a nice, quiet,
private little table,

13:32.917 --> 13:34.500
so we can really talk.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.625
Or we could do something fun.

13:36.709 --> 13:39.542
A band I know is playing
in Echo Park tonight--

13:39.625 --> 13:41.291
they're terrible.
But after this...

13:41.375 --> 13:44.583
Oh.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.375
You'd rather do that
than go to dinner and talk?

13:47.458 --> 13:50.000
Craigy, this
is a cheaper option

13:50.083 --> 13:52.375
and you still get laid,
so take the win.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.959
Okay, yeah.
This could be fun.

13:55.041 --> 13:56.625
But just a heads up,
when I get high,

13:56.709 --> 13:58.417
I tend to open up.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.959
You're about to get to know
me on a pretty deep level.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.208
Oh, well... Oh!

14:03.291 --> 14:05.542
Oops. It got away from me.

14:05.625 --> 14:06.959
Butterfingers.
I guess we'll just

14:07.041 --> 14:09.000
have to skip
straight to the sex.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.875
Or you could just
pick up the joint...
Mm.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.542
Drop something?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.834
Hm.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.709
Uh, C-C-Craig?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.208
Who... who said that?

14:21.291 --> 14:24.125
I can't see
because of my glaucoma.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.792
Step out of
the vehicle, please.

14:25.875 --> 14:26.875
Okay.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.625
GERALD:
Come on, come on, come on.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.417
All right, what is
the big surprise?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.250
Is Rihanna here?
'Cause I'm sort of over her.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.667
You'll see.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.375
Oh, now I know it's Rihanna.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.458
Stop guessing.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.709
GERALD:
♪ Ta-da! ♪

14:42.792 --> 14:43.792
(chuckles)

14:45.750 --> 14:47.083
Would you believe
that we're not actually

14:47.166 --> 14:48.917
at Silicon Beach
right now?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.834
Oh, wait, before you
answer that-- play ocean sounds.

14:51.917 --> 14:55.542
(waves crashing, gulls cry)

14:55.625 --> 14:58.500
a dork on a hoverboard.
Yeah, yeah.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.375
You did this for me?

15:00.458 --> 15:02.667
That depends. Are you impressed
or do you find this creepy?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.458
You're the freakin'
best dude ever.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.959
Look, Vanessa...
this app, this business

15:16.041 --> 15:18.875
we're building together,
it's thanks to you.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.375
You make me feel like I can do

15:20.458 --> 15:21.959
anything in the world...
except eat dairy.

15:22.041 --> 15:24.333
And... and I want to make
you feel the same way.

15:24.417 --> 15:27.291
Now, I know this isn't exactly
the fancy office

15:27.375 --> 15:29.375
that you dreamed of,
but I promise you,

15:29.458 --> 15:30.875
all right? We won't...

15:38.625 --> 15:40.709
(doorbell rings)

15:40.792 --> 15:42.166
(knocking on door)

15:42.250 --> 15:43.458
(doorbell rings)

15:43.542 --> 15:45.166
Who is it?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.417
Uh, Catherine.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.208
Catherine!

15:49.291 --> 15:51.500
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?

15:51.583 --> 15:54.500
What are you doing dressed like
a freshman during finals?

15:54.583 --> 15:56.709
We have a date.

15:56.792 --> 15:57.709
You made this whole
big deal about

15:57.792 --> 15:59.083
me coming to your place first?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.333
Yes, I'm such a scatterbrain.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.750
I was just hanging out,
you know,

16:01.834 --> 16:03.083
eating popcorn,
catching up with my stories,

16:03.166 --> 16:04.792
but I'm gonna
take a long shower.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.083
We're gonna take you out.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.291
You like hot dogs?

16:07.375 --> 16:08.834
Yeah, hard pass on that.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.750
Wait, what?

16:10.834 --> 16:12.750
It just feels like you're
playing some kind of game.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.750
I don't play games.
They bore me,

16:14.834 --> 16:16.208
and I win them too easily.

16:16.291 --> 16:17.667
Take care.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.000
Oh, yeah, you don't play games.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.750
Who takes two hours
to text somebody back?

16:20.834 --> 16:22.333
A game player.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.542
And you also stole my popcorn.

16:28.709 --> 16:29.875
Hey, Jimmy, thank you
for bailing us out.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.333
Oh, no problem, Cheech.

16:31.417 --> 16:32.750
You want to ride in my car
or you gonna take

16:32.834 --> 16:34.458
your magic carpet?

16:34.542 --> 16:36.375
Hey, you want
to go see that band now?

16:36.458 --> 16:39.375
Nah, I'm good. I think
I got enough entertainment

16:39.458 --> 16:42.500
watching my cellmate expel
a condom of crystal meth.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.208
Oh, come on. It was just
a little bit of stupid fun.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.500
So we can't buy a firearm now...

16:47.583 --> 16:49.375
I'm all about stupid fun.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.792
I once braided my hair with
little seashells to be funny,

16:51.875 --> 16:53.583
and then kept it for five years.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.375
Wow.

16:55.458 --> 16:58.375
about stupid fun... I mean,
every time we get together,

16:58.458 --> 17:01.208
it turns into getting high in
a car or having sex in a car.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.959
With this Sara that happened?

17:03.041 --> 17:04.542
Sorry, you guys
are having a thing.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.166
Look, I'm sad to say this,
Sara-- I just think

17:06.250 --> 17:07.542
that we want different things.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.875
I'll see you around.
It's been fun.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.375
Oh, crap.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.625
You okay?

17:17.709 --> 17:19.166
If it makes you feel
any better,

17:19.250 --> 17:21.417
I, too, am having
a terrible night.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.458
Oh. Were you also almost
cut for being a snitch?

17:24.542 --> 17:27.208
Worse. I started dating
this girl,

17:27.291 --> 17:30.250
and, basically, she's
the female version of me.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.709
That's terrible.

17:31.792 --> 17:34.625
No, that's not even
the bad part... I think.

17:34.709 --> 17:37.417
The bad part is I-I was trying
to get the upper hand,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.375
and I acted like an idiot.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.709
Do you really like her

17:40.792 --> 17:43.041
or are you just bummed
that you lost some game?

17:43.125 --> 17:44.667
Because if it's
the game thing,

17:44.750 --> 17:47.667
just buy yourself something
expensive and unnecessary.

17:47.750 --> 17:51.542
If you actually like her,
you should tell her.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.917
She probably doesn't know.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.166
So I still may have
the upper hand.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.417
Oh, Jimmy...

17:58.500 --> 18:00.417
Kidding. Good advice.
Thank you.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.417
Mm-hmm.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.750
Aw, it's cute that
you're trying. But no.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.667
(knocking)

18:07.750 --> 18:09.542
Hey.

18:09.625 --> 18:12.000
I'm not sure why you
asked me to come over.

18:12.083 --> 18:15.125
If it's an apology, it's weird
that you made me drive to you.

18:15.208 --> 18:18.291
That is true. But I made

18:18.375 --> 18:20.125
a tasting course dinner

18:20.208 --> 18:23.458
to make up for the one
that we missed.

18:23.542 --> 18:25.458
We were in jail.
I forgot about that.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.709
Okay, now, keep
your expectations in check.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.917
I only had an hour
to put all of this together.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But for our first course,
we have the tail end

18:33.083 --> 18:35.375
of a sun-dried tomato hummus

18:35.458 --> 18:36.625
paired with baby carrots

18:36.709 --> 18:38.875
that may have peaked
a couple of weeks ago.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.792
You're literally naming
my favorite leftovers.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.959
(chuckles)
Okay. For our second course,

18:44.041 --> 18:46.500
this block of cheddar
and a baguette

18:46.583 --> 18:47.709
that doubles as a weapon.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.458
Whoa. How did I get
a reservation here?

18:50.542 --> 18:52.583
Well, it doesn't hurt that
you're sleeping with the chef.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.333
Um...

18:56.417 --> 18:59.041
look, I need another shot.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.041
I got into this thinking I was
just gonna keep things fun,

19:02.125 --> 19:03.667
but that led to jail.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.500
And I think I strained my
neck from all that car sex.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.125
Did I do something wrong?

19:08.208 --> 19:10.709
I think the problem was
that you didn't.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.125
Hmm.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.500
with a lot of flaws,
like a bigot or a klepto

19:16.583 --> 19:19.041
or a stand-up comedian,
because if it ends,

19:19.125 --> 19:20.500
I don't have to care.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.792
But you're great,

19:22.875 --> 19:25.667
and this felt real in a way
that I wasn't used to.

19:25.750 --> 19:29.375
I got scared.
So I acted like a dummy.

19:29.458 --> 19:33.834
I can start being a klepto,
if that helps.

19:33.917 --> 19:36.625
(chuckles)
Or...

19:36.709 --> 19:38.625
let's try this your way.

19:39.625 --> 19:40.750
Let's go deeper.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.667
Do you want me
to tell you about

19:43.750 --> 19:45.291
my classmate from
high school who died?

19:45.375 --> 19:47.041
Can you do it
while we're eating?

19:47.125 --> 19:50.542
Deal. To be honest,
she was kind of a bitch.

19:50.625 --> 19:54.083
(Gerald and Vanessa
sighing contentedly)

19:54.166 --> 19:55.542
(chuckles)

19:55.625 --> 19:57.542
Hey, are we giving this
another try?

19:57.625 --> 20:01.458
Uh, I mean, I thought we said
we weren't, 'cause of Edie.

20:01.542 --> 20:05.333
Yeah, we did say that.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.041
But screw Edie.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.834
I love you.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.750
I love you, too.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.000
Don't ever say
screw my daughter again.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.542
Got it.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.875
(chuckles)

20:16.959 --> 20:17.875
GERALD:
Oh!

20:17.959 --> 20:19.125
Seriously?

20:19.208 --> 20:20.875
What is it
with your horny family?!

20:20.959 --> 20:23.583
I've seen every one of you naked
this week.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.583
Sorry, Annelise!

20:24.667 --> 20:26.166
My bad!

20:26.250 --> 20:27.792
(chuckles)

20:27.875 --> 20:30.583
(doorbell chimes)

20:30.667 --> 20:32.834
Hi.

20:32.917 --> 20:34.583
So, I screwed up pretty badly.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.166
Yes. Continue.

20:36.250 --> 20:37.667
Continue? Isn't this
the part where you say,

20:37.750 --> 20:39.792
"You had me at 'hi.'
And take your top off"?

20:39.875 --> 20:42.875
No, you don't have me yet.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.417
You were right.
I was playing games.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.208
I-I just didn't know what to do

20:47.291 --> 20:49.500
with a woman like you.
And all the girls

20:49.583 --> 20:51.542
I've been with before
weren't adequate preparation.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.542
All the girls?

20:52.625 --> 20:54.250
All three.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.625
♪ All the clouds... ♪

20:56.709 --> 20:58.333
No, I-I...

20:58.417 --> 21:01.625
I know this isn't PC,
but I-I've never been the woman

21:01.709 --> 21:03.834
in a relationship.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.458
I haven't either.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.625
Really?

21:07.709 --> 21:09.208
Get in here.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.917
So how's this gonna work,
two kings ruling one country?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.834
Well, the Romans had
two tribunes.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.917
But they usually killed
each other.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.291
That's not gonna happen here,
is it?

21:18.375 --> 21:19.625
Not intentionally.

21:19.709 --> 21:20.875
But we could try.

21:20.959 --> 21:23.000
(chuckles)

21:23.083 --> 21:26.000
I'm in. But this time
I want my frittata.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.667
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.625
Race you. Oh, oh, oh! (whoops)
