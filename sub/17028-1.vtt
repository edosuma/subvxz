Hey, Earl.

00:03.131 --> 00:07.411
It's the brand new us in brand
new gently used outfits.

00:07.987 --> 00:10.790
The pit stains are vintage.

00:10.791 --> 00:12.725
I dug mine out of a dumpster.

00:12.726 --> 00:15.728
It wasn't even touching the diaper.

00:15.729 --> 00:19.131
I'm not used to seeing
you girls in clothes.

00:19.132 --> 00:22.301
Things just sound
creepier when you're old.

00:22.302 --> 00:24.570
As new part owners of the diner,

00:24.571 --> 00:25.871
we're making improvements.

00:25.872 --> 00:28.040
Heh, not in the food or decor

00:28.041 --> 00:30.576
'cause LOL.

00:30.577 --> 00:32.377
But we're just gonna look better.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.248
Oleg, did you hear the news?

00:36.249 --> 00:38.150
We're not wearing uniforms anymore.

00:38.151 --> 00:39.251
Cool.

00:39.252 --> 00:40.351
Let's do it.

00:42.822 --> 00:44.724
Just say the word.

00:44.725 --> 00:47.994
The underwear is tear-away too.

00:47.995 --> 00:51.530
Don't say words.

00:51.531 --> 00:53.099
Oh, God!

00:53.100 --> 00:56.202
I think I just looked into
the eye of the tiger.

00:56.203 --> 00:58.337
Oh, it's my roach friend, Pierre.

00:58.338 --> 01:01.173
Bonjour, Pierre.

Au revoir, Pierre.

directly into your mouth?

02:56.118 --> 02:58.854
Han, since the diner
is now owner operated,

02:58.855 --> 03:01.323
if we have to wait on tables,
so do you.

03:01.324 --> 03:03.626
You're gonna cover our shifts

Max's heartbreak

10:27.468 --> 10:30.436
I'd love to have friends over
to my puddle for a change.

10:30.437 --> 10:32.472
Our liquor license was
supposed to come today.

10:32.473 --> 10:33.856
We should have gotten mail by now.

10:33.857 --> 10:35.742
We also should have left batteries

10:35.743 --> 10:37.143
in the carbon monoxide detector,

10:37.144 --> 10:40.046
but I got tired of all the beeping.

10:40.047 --> 10:43.115
Do your eyes feel bloodier than usual?

10:44.217 --> 10:45.918
Hey, gals!

10:45.919 --> 10:48.488
Yeah, nope. Still not a mother.

10:48.489 --> 10:51.657
Oh, I'm so bored.

10:51.658 --> 10:54.894
I've Netflix'd, Hulu'd, Amazoned.

10:54.895 --> 10:58.731
I'm about to HBO GO out of my mind.

10:58.732 --> 11:01.501
Sophie, where did you
get those Upsy Daisies?

11:01.502 --> 11:03.336
Oh, Han gave them to me.

11:03.337 --> 11:06.672
Yeah, and he tried to sell me
a time-share in the Poconos.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.508
Yeah, but I got to say,

11:08.509 --> 11:10.810
I was a little intrigued.

11:10.811 --> 11:12.412
Sophie, you shouldn't be down here.

11:12.413 --> 11:14.781
There's a probable
carbon monoxide leak.

11:14.782 --> 11:16.681
You should go check out our pool.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.353
Why did Han give you flowers?

11:20.354 --> 11:22.188
Is he trying to hit that? (chuckles)

11:22.189 --> 11:25.258
Oh, well, he'd have
to reach that first.

11:25.259 --> 11:26.759
No, they were for you guys.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.761
Yeah, Caroline didn't want them.

11:28.762 --> 11:31.163
Yeah, but I'm not above
garbage flowers.

11:32.432 --> 11:35.033
These are from Randy for me.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.938
You!

11:38.939 --> 11:41.307
Max, I didn't want to tell
you about the flowers.

11:41.308 --> 11:42.842
I didn't want to upset you.

11:42.843 --> 11:44.277
If you don't want to upset me,

11:44.278 --> 11:47.380
then why do you chew salad so loudly?

11:47.381 --> 11:50.148
Uh, she's got a point there, Caroline.

11:56.322 --> 11:58.558
I am not mad.

11:58.559 --> 11:59.459
You're not?

11:59.460 --> 12:00.726
No.

12:00.727 --> 12:02.795
It was really nice of
Randy to send flowers

12:02.796 --> 12:04.797
and maybe I should call him.

12:04.798 --> 12:07.033
Bad idea to get in touch with Randy.

12:07.034 --> 12:08.634
Very bad idea, like,

12:08.635 --> 12:10.169
jumpsuits on short women.

12:10.170 --> 12:11.170
What?

12:11.171 --> 12:12.505
He did a nice thing

12:12.506 --> 12:14.173
and I just want to thank him.

12:14.174 --> 12:15.641
We'll thank him together.

12:15.642 --> 12:17.310
You know what people
like to get nowadays?

12:17.311 --> 12:20.880
A handwritten note.
Let me grab my stationery.

12:20.881 --> 12:23.114
It's a Rite Aid receipt so
there's plenty of room.

12:24.517 --> 12:26.886
- Dear Randy...
- You know what?

12:26.887 --> 12:28.888
Just calling Randy is rude.

12:28.889 --> 12:30.723
Since when do you worry about rude?

12:30.724 --> 12:32.987
- You interrupt almost every...
- I want to FaceTime him.

12:32.988 --> 12:33.726
(phone beeping)

12:33.727 --> 12:35.790
That's much worse, and you
just interrupted me Ag...

12:35.791 --> 12:37.063
- Hi, Randy.
- Max!

12:37.064 --> 12:38.764
It's so great to hear from you.

12:38.765 --> 12:41.334
Is Caroline not there,
or is she standing behind you

12:41.335 --> 12:43.870
with her arms folded, looking angry?

12:43.871 --> 12:46.172
My arms aren't folded,
they're on my hips.

12:46.173 --> 12:47.874
And I'm not angry, but Max called you

12:47.875 --> 12:49.675
without my permission.

12:49.676 --> 12:52.411
Hi, Miss Channing.

12:52.412 --> 12:54.080
Max has to get off the phone.

12:54.081 --> 12:56.749
You're embarrassing me.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.518
Max, it took you three months

12:58.519 --> 13:00.786
and a palette of Cheetos
to get over him.

13:00.787 --> 13:03.221
RANDY: You covered the screen,
not the speaker.

13:04.724 --> 13:06.359
You shouldn't be talking to him.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.145
(scoffs)

13:07.146 --> 13:08.928
You shouldn't be
wearing blue eye shadow.

13:08.929 --> 13:09.896
(gasps)

13:09.897 --> 13:11.864
You told me it looked nice

13:11.865 --> 13:14.467
and now I've ruined the receipt
and I can't take it back.

13:14.468 --> 13:16.769
RANDY: Guys, I'm getting whiplash.

13:16.770 --> 13:17.637
You know what?

13:17.638 --> 13:20.740
Everyone just calm down.

13:20.741 --> 13:22.475
I'm just saying thank you.

13:22.476 --> 13:24.342
God-uh!

13:26.145 --> 13:27.246
Sophie, is it time?

13:27.247 --> 13:28.114
Are you in labor?

13:28.115 --> 13:30.149
No. (panting)

13:30.150 --> 13:32.317
I broke my masturbating underwear.

13:33.619 --> 13:36.155
Ah, but you know how that goes.

13:36.156 --> 13:37.423
I do not

13:37.424 --> 13:39.791
and I will not act like I might.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.995
You know, you're a puzzle

13:42.996 --> 13:46.399
that I have no interest in solving.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.466
Here's your mail.

13:47.467 --> 13:48.334
(gasps) The mail.

13:48.335 --> 13:49.969
Our liquor license.

13:49.970 --> 13:50.803
Yeah.

13:50.804 --> 13:52.338
You know what,

13:52.339 --> 13:54.974
I think my masturbating
underwear is short-circuiting,

13:54.975 --> 13:58.310
but... eeh... oh...
but it feels pretty good.

14:00.613 --> 14:04.549
Is not coming because I made
a tiny mistake on the forms?

14:05.751 --> 14:07.620
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

14:07.621 --> 14:10.790
nobody knows what a dessert bar is.

14:10.791 --> 14:11.824
And frankly,

14:11.825 --> 14:13.858
it just makes people angry.

14:16.596 --> 14:17.863
Max, I have bad news.

14:17.864 --> 14:20.166
Oh, my God... you're naked!

14:20.167 --> 14:22.467
I'm saying thank you to Randy.

14:24.036 --> 14:27.707
Looks like Randy is thanking himself.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.141
Oh, hey, sorry about that.

14:29.142 --> 14:31.543
That thank you kind of got away from us.

14:32.979 --> 14:34.981
Max, put your pants on,
we're going downtown.

14:34.982 --> 14:36.682
That's funny, Randy just told me

14:36.683 --> 14:38.284
to take them off for the same reason.

14:38.285 --> 14:41.152
<i>♪</i> ♪

14:47.364 --> 14:50.500
<i>♪</i> ♪

14:50.501 --> 14:52.102
Last time I saw a line this long,

14:52.103 --> 14:54.504
it went up my nose.

14:54.505 --> 14:57.207
And I almost married Katt Williams.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.542
Excuse me?

14:58.543 --> 15:00.344
Is there a different line for people

15:00.345 --> 15:02.448
who just made one tiny mistake
and it's not her fault

15:02.449 --> 15:04.382
'cause she was just
overwhelmed at the time?

15:09.586 --> 15:11.288
Max, we're gonna die here.

15:11.289 --> 15:13.857
Ugh, finally.

15:13.858 --> 15:16.041
I'd give out flyers for the
dessert bar, but I just saw

15:16.042 --> 15:18.428
someone pull an unwrapped
cheese stick out of his pocket.

15:18.429 --> 15:21.231
I can't believe you
filled out a form wrong.

15:21.232 --> 15:22.932
Start a business much?

15:24.568 --> 15:27.704
Uh, in my defense,
this is kind of your fault.

15:27.705 --> 15:29.740
Me? How is it my fault?

15:29.741 --> 15:33.243
I was in a fort made out
of pillows most of July.

15:33.244 --> 15:34.778
Or was it August?

15:34.779 --> 15:36.880
I don't know, you can lose
track of time in a fort.

15:36.881 --> 15:38.248
Exactly.

15:38.249 --> 15:40.284
I had to jackass around this whole city

15:40.285 --> 15:41.988
to get the dessert bar
ready while you were

15:41.989 --> 15:44.221
rolling in the deep,
getting over Randy.

15:44.222 --> 15:45.889
So...

15:45.890 --> 15:48.290
hello from the other side.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.295
Girl fight.

15:51.296 --> 15:52.695
Worldstar.

15:54.932 --> 15:56.733
And now, after all that,

15:56.734 --> 15:59.503
I catch you going down
on Randy's iPhone.

15:59.504 --> 16:00.567
I'm warning you right now,

16:00.568 --> 16:02.572
I am not bathing you again.

16:02.573 --> 16:05.742
Look, there is a mathematical formula

16:05.743 --> 16:07.511
involved in break-up sex.

16:07.512 --> 16:08.979
What do you know about math?

16:08.980 --> 16:12.449
You always leave out six
when you count to ten.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.583
Doesn't mean you're stupid.

16:13.584 --> 16:15.551
A lot of persons do that.

16:16.687 --> 16:18.822
Typically, in a break-up,

16:18.823 --> 16:20.324
if you live in the same city,

16:20.325 --> 16:22.206
you go to the guy's house
to pick up your stuff,

16:22.207 --> 16:23.041
and then you do it.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.594
That's one time.

16:24.595 --> 16:27.664
Then you "forget something"
and he brings it to your place

16:27.665 --> 16:28.498
and then you do it.

16:28.499 --> 16:29.700
That's two.

16:29.701 --> 16:31.668
Then you run into each other at a bar,

16:31.669 --> 16:32.602
do it in the bathroom.

16:32.603 --> 16:33.937
Three.

16:33.938 --> 16:37.007
Then you fake a pregnancy. That's four.

16:37.008 --> 16:39.376
Then he fakes an STD. That's five.

16:39.377 --> 16:41.911
And then you're broken up.

16:44.014 --> 16:45.549
There's been no math.

16:45.550 --> 16:47.718
(scoffs) Five is a number.

16:47.719 --> 16:50.086
Numbers are math. Read a book.

16:51.321 --> 16:53.357
Yeah. Read a book.

16:53.358 --> 16:55.659
Name a book.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.059
The phone book.

16:58.562 --> 17:01.698
This line is for
municipal licenses only.

17:01.699 --> 17:04.534
Not driver's licenses,
wedding licenses, or whatnot.

17:04.535 --> 17:06.569
Municipal licenses.

17:06.570 --> 17:08.305
If you don't know what that is,
you're in the wrong line.

17:08.306 --> 17:10.040
How could you not know what line

17:10.040 --> 17:11.614
you're supposed to be standing in?

17:11.615 --> 17:12.842
(sighs)

17:15.846 --> 17:18.348
Randy, let me call you
back from the bathroom.

17:18.348 --> 17:20.384
I know where it is.
I used to work here.

17:20.385 --> 17:21.250
Max!

17:22.551 --> 17:24.021
Hey, Caroline.

17:24.021 --> 17:26.356
Oh, Max was just thanking
me for the flowers again.

17:26.357 --> 17:28.759
That's why I'm not wearing a shirt.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.894
Or pants.

17:30.895 --> 17:32.896
Uh, let me call you back,
but keep your pants off.

17:32.897 --> 17:35.065
(chuckles)

17:35.066 --> 17:37.367
What? I am not counting that as one.

17:37.368 --> 17:39.236
Were you really gonna spank it

17:39.237 --> 17:41.238
in the middle of the
municipal building?

17:41.239 --> 17:42.773
Spank it?

17:42.774 --> 17:45.008
Don't be crass, Caroline.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.210
Yes.

17:47.211 --> 17:48.445
Next!

17:48.446 --> 17:49.613
Ding ding ding!

17:49.614 --> 17:51.081
It's just some clerical error

17:51.082 --> 17:53.016
so we should be able
to get our license today.

17:53.017 --> 17:54.117
Let me handle this.

17:54.118 --> 17:55.352
You know you have a history of

17:55.353 --> 17:57.419
getting slappy with bureaucrats.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.389
Hi.

17:59.390 --> 18:00.924
We got this in the mail,

18:00.925 --> 18:02.726
and there's been some
teensy little mistake...

18:02.727 --> 18:05.494
Well, well, well!

18:06.463 --> 18:08.732
Him!

18:08.733 --> 18:10.567
I've got this, Moesha.

18:10.568 --> 18:12.071
Why don't you go clean up your little

18:12.072 --> 18:15.572
Lean Cuisine explosion in the microwave?

18:15.573 --> 18:18.408
Oh, she's a mess.

18:18.409 --> 18:20.143
Now, how can I

18:20.144 --> 18:22.946
not help you two?

18:22.947 --> 18:24.981
This is your dead-end job?

18:24.982 --> 18:27.150
I pictured you working as a drug mule

18:27.151 --> 18:29.719
or a seat filler on <i>The View.</i>

18:29.720 --> 18:32.389
That's a job?

18:32.390 --> 18:34.825
Dude, I just made a
mistake on the application.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.266
Can't you just give us a break?

18:36.267 --> 18:38.290
Our dessert bar is supposed
to open tomorrow night.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.064
Please?

18:39.065 --> 18:40.730
I gave up a boyfriend for this business,

18:40.731 --> 18:42.065
and I'm gonna mess up

18:42.066 --> 18:44.167
her pretty face if it doesn't work out.

18:44.168 --> 18:46.002
Max, thank you.

18:46.003 --> 18:48.604
I was starting to think you
didn't think I was that pretty.

18:50.474 --> 18:52.976
If we don't fix this, we're
gonna have to delay our opening.

18:52.977 --> 18:54.478
So please?

18:54.479 --> 18:55.679
You know what?

18:55.680 --> 18:57.513
Let me talk to my supervisor.

18:58.849 --> 19:01.884
<i>(audience groans and laughs)</i>

19:05.188 --> 19:07.090
His neck's a little rusty,

19:07.091 --> 19:10.026
but that's a no.

19:10.027 --> 19:12.195
<i>♪</i>

19:12.196 --> 19:14.764
I would make us a drink
but without a liquor license,

19:14.765 --> 19:16.165
all I can make is meth.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.635
This is all my fault.

19:18.636 --> 19:20.770
No, I was in a funk about Randy

19:20.771 --> 19:22.554
and you had to do all
this stuff on your own.

19:22.555 --> 19:24.207
- It's my fault.
- Okay, good.

19:24.208 --> 19:25.809
That's what I really thought,

19:25.810 --> 19:27.790
but I just wanted to make
sure it was out there.

19:28.945 --> 19:31.848
We have zero luck, Max, zero.

19:31.849 --> 19:35.018
I just stopped by to say

19:35.019 --> 19:37.854
I'm sorry about your dessert bar.

19:37.855 --> 19:41.357
You two are unlucky A, F.

19:42.459 --> 19:45.328
That's "As Freddie."

19:45.329 --> 19:46.796
He's a friend of mine.

19:46.797 --> 19:49.098
He's very unlucky.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.201

And...

40:27.948 --> 40:29.948
I'm having my birthday here.

40:31.284 --> 40:33.151
Let's bounce, 2 Chainz.

40:35.755 --> 40:37.624
So long, pal.

40:37.625 --> 40:39.168
You're gonna have to find someone else

40:39.169 --> 40:40.902
to use as a chew toy.

40:42.562 --> 40:44.197
Oh, man.

40:44.198 --> 40:46.766
Sorry about the bar, girls.

40:46.767 --> 40:49.936
I mean, guess I'm gonna
have to get me a bottle of rosé

40:49.937 --> 40:51.670
and head over to Mrs. Fields' again.

40:53.106 --> 40:55.041
Does she have a sister?

40:55.042 --> 40:57.310
Or a color TV?

40:57.311 --> 40:59.145
See you later, girls.

40:59.146 --> 41:01.613
It look like I'm gonna go party
with the old man right here.

41:04.584 --> 41:07.153
(indistinct chatter)

41:07.154 --> 41:08.955
Can you guys just give
us another minute?

41:08.956 --> 41:11.825
Or 14 business days?

41:11.826 --> 41:14.227
The only thing that opened
and closed faster than us

41:14.228 --> 41:16.830
was <i>Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.</i>

41:16.831 --> 41:19.566
Well, at least I didn't get
a blow out for this.

41:19.567 --> 41:21.768
That lessens the sting
of a failed opening.

41:21.769 --> 41:23.102
Are you kidding?

41:23.103 --> 41:24.838
I think this is gonna
make us more popular.

41:24.839 --> 41:27.073
You know how people always
want what they can't have.

41:27.074 --> 41:29.576
Like you with everything.

41:29.577 --> 41:32.679
If that's true, then
why do you look upset?

41:32.680 --> 41:35.148
'Cause Randy and I
are really broken up.

41:35.149 --> 41:37.750
We burned through the
Affleck-Garner clause,

41:37.751 --> 41:40.186
the Cox-Arquette addendum.

41:40.187 --> 41:42.155
As soon as we got to the
Bieber-Gomez principle,

41:42.156 --> 41:44.757
we were ashamed of ourselves.

41:44.758 --> 41:47.594
Max, you're the queen
of not following the rules.

41:47.595 --> 41:49.028
"Rules, schmules," you say.

41:49.029 --> 41:50.196
Yes!

41:50.197 --> 41:52.198
Rules, schmules!

41:52.199 --> 41:54.499
And condoms, schmondoms.

41:56.336 --> 41:58.705
Yeah, that one's not great.

41:58.706 --> 42:00.707
What I'm saying is you make stuff up.

42:00.708 --> 42:01.808
Like this dessert bar.

42:01.809 --> 42:03.276
And that was a great idea.

42:03.277 --> 42:06.045
So you should make up
rules for you and Randy.

42:06.046 --> 42:08.389
'Cause it really seems like
you guys care about each other.

42:08.390 --> 42:10.617
Yeah, you're right.

42:10.618 --> 42:12.151
Break-up, schmake-up.

42:12.152 --> 42:13.486
Now, go call Randy

42:13.487 --> 42:15.320
and make me want to burn my iPad.

42:16.689 --> 42:19.959
Go, I'm begging you.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.694
Yeah, we're gonna kill it

42:21.695 --> 42:24.096
in 14 business days.
