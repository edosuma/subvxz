<i>Fire...</i>

<i>Air.</i>

00:11.300 --> 00:15.350
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.430 --> 00:18.730
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.770 --> 00:22.480
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.570 --> 00:23.690
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.780 --> 00:25.610
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.690 --> 00:26.990
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:31.200
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:32.870
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.250
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.330 --> 00:37.830
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:37.910 --> 00:38.920
AANG: Oof.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

00:55.270 --> 00:56.690
( COOING )

01:04.190 --> 01:06.860
This should give us a good idea
of what's around here.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.030
See if you can find a menu.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.370
I'm starving.

01:09.450 --> 01:11.280
I bet we'll find something
to eat here...

01:11.370 --> 01:13.330
The Fire Days Festival.

01:13.660 --> 01:15.580
Fire Nation cultural exhibits,

01:15.790 --> 01:17.580
jugglers, benders, magicians...

01:18.250 --> 01:21.540
This would be a great place for me
to study some real firebenders.

01:21.630 --> 01:22.960
You might want to rethink that.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.050
Look at this.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.420
AANG: Hey, a poster of me!

01:26.510 --> 01:28.010
A wanted poster.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.720
This is bad.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.970
I think we better keep moving.

01:32.390 --> 01:34.100
I have to learn firebending
at some point,

01:34.310 --> 01:37.810
and this could be my only chance
to watch some masters up close.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.600
I guess we could go check it out.

01:39.940 --> 01:41.060
What?

01:41.150 --> 01:42.730
You want to walk into
a Fire Nation town

01:42.820 --> 01:45.740
when they're all fired up
with all their, you know, fire?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.200
We'll wear disguises.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.780
And if it looks like trouble,
we'll leave.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.030
Yeah.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.740
Because we always leave
before we get into trouble.

02:00.130 --> 02:01.790
( GROWLING )

02:03.420 --> 02:05.920
You guys stay out of sight here
while we go to the festival.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.420
( COOING )

02:13.680 --> 02:15.310
Ready disguises.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.320
It's like you're a whole
different person.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.780
Let's go!

02:34.700 --> 02:36.080
Ha ha ha ha!

02:42.670 --> 02:45.250
KATARA: I think we need
some new disguises.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.670
Where are we gonna get
masks like that?

02:47.880 --> 02:51.590
Get your genuine
Fire-Festival masks here!

02:51.680 --> 02:53.800
That was surprisingly easy.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.230
Hey, there's some food.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.320
Finally!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.030
What do you have?

03:08.110 --> 03:09.240
Flaming fire flakes.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.360
Best in town.

03:10.450 --> 03:11.450
I'll take 'em.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.700
Mmm! Mmm!

03:12.780 --> 03:13.820
( SCREAMING )

03:13.910 --> 03:15.280
Oh, hot, hot!

03:15.370 --> 03:18.040
Flaming fire flakes, hot.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120
What do you know?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.210
Hey, look at this!

03:22.790 --> 03:24.710
Don't worry, loyal citizens,

03:24.920 --> 03:27.960
no one can surprise the Fire Lord!

03:28.170 --> 03:29.800
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

03:32.220 --> 03:33.760
( CHEERING )

03:36.180 --> 03:37.350
KATARA: Aang, hold on.

03:37.430 --> 03:38.560
Where are we going?

03:38.640 --> 03:39.640
I don't know...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.890
But there's a big crowd,
so it must be good.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.100
SOKKA: Knowing the Fire Nation,

03:43.190 --> 03:44.600
it's probably an execution.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.610
( APPLAUSE )

03:52.700 --> 03:54.320
I gotta learn that trick.

03:54.410 --> 03:55.530
Thank you!

03:55.620 --> 03:56.660
For my next trick,

03:56.740 --> 03:58.700
I need a volunteer from the audience.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.200
Ooh, ooh! Me! me!

04:00.290 --> 04:01.790
What do you think you're doing?

04:01.870 --> 04:03.540
I want to get a closer look.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.750
It's better that we don't attract
any attention to ourselves.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.630
How about you, little lady?

04:08.710 --> 04:09.750
Uh...

04:09.840 --> 04:11.800
Aw, she's shy.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.590
Let's give her some
encouragement, folks.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.430
( CHEERING )

04:17.640 --> 04:19.560
Aw, that could have been me.

04:22.430 --> 04:26.860
This next trick is called
Taming the Dragon!

04:26.940 --> 04:28.770
You will be my captured princess.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.200
Don't worry, young maiden!

04:41.540 --> 04:44.410
I will tame this fiery beast!

04:49.710 --> 04:51.050
It's too strong!

04:51.130 --> 04:52.130
I can't hold it!

04:52.590 --> 04:53.880
We gotta help her!

04:53.970 --> 04:55.590
No, we don't want to make a scene.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.010
The rope... It's breaking!

05:27.870 --> 05:29.000
I can get you out of here!

05:43.470 --> 05:44.770
I'm calling Appa.

that bison whistle!

05:49.900 --> 05:51.060

( LAUGHTER )

06:37.610 --> 06:39.650
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.780
You seem to really know
your explosives.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.870
I'm familiar.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.700
You're a Fire Nation soldier.

06:44.780 --> 06:45.870
Was.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.410
My name's Chey.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.580
CHEY: I serve a man...

06:51.670 --> 06:52.830
More than a man, really,

06:52.920 --> 06:54.000
he's a myth...

06:54.090 --> 06:56.050
But he's real, a living legend...

06:56.130 --> 06:57.960
Jeong Jeong the Deserter.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.130
He was a Fire Nation general.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.260
Or wait... Was he an admiral?

07:02.470 --> 07:04.390
He was very highly ranked. We get it.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.220
Yeah! Way up there!

07:06.310 --> 07:08.180
But he couldn't take
the madness anymore.

07:08.270 --> 07:11.190
He's the first person ever
to leave the army and live.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.650
I'm the second, but you don't
get to be a legend for that.

07:13.730 --> 07:14.730
It's ok, though.

07:15.190 --> 07:17.280
Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.780
Some say he's mad,

07:18.860 --> 07:20.280
but he's not.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.740
He's enlightened.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.410
You mean there's a firebender out here

07:23.490 --> 07:24.910
who's not with the Fire Lord?

07:24.990 --> 07:26.160
We've gotta go see him!

07:26.240 --> 07:27.240
He can train me!

07:27.580 --> 07:30.000
We're not gonna go find
some crazy firebender.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.790
CHEY: He's not crazy!

07:31.870 --> 07:33.580
He's a genius!

07:33.670 --> 07:36.170
And he's the perfect person
to train the Avatar.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.500
That's why I followed you
into the festival.

07:38.590 --> 07:39.960
Look, thanks for the help,

07:40.050 --> 07:42.220
but we're leaving for the North Pole
in the morning.

07:42.300 --> 07:46.510
Sokka, this could be my only chance
to meet a firebending master

07:46.600 --> 07:48.930
who would actually be willing
to teach me.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.730
It can't hurt just to talk to him.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.270
That's what you said about
going to the festival!

07:53.350 --> 07:55.360
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?

not to look for Avatar.

08:15.540 --> 08:16.580
Oh, yeah.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.880

08:34.140 --> 08:35.440
We can chat later.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.900
Is that where Jeong Jeong is?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.560
I need to talk to him right away.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.270
No. You wait there.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.940
Go, now!

08:42.030 --> 08:44.200
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

08:44.700 --> 08:45.910
He's a great man.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.240
A great man!

08:51.990 --> 08:53.960
ZHAO: So, the Avatar was here

08:54.040 --> 08:55.500
and you let him slip away?

08:55.750 --> 08:56.830
Yes, sir.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.380
But other than that,
the festival went off without a hitch.

08:59.460 --> 09:00.800
( GRUNTS )

09:00.880 --> 09:02.800
No fights. Theft was way down.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.630
I don't care
about your local crime rates!

09:05.720 --> 09:07.390
Which way did they go?

09:07.720 --> 09:09.050
They headed into the forest.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.560
Up the river, I suspect.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.640
Ready the riverboats.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.810
We're going after the Avatar.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.110
What happened?
Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.530
He won't see you.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.740
He's very angry
that I brought you here.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.330
He wants you to leave immediately.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.240
Finally! Let's hit the road.

09:33.330 --> 09:34.790
Why won't he see me?

09:35.370 --> 09:36.750
He says you're not ready.

09:36.830 --> 09:39.580
Says you haven't mastered
waterbending and earthbending yet.

09:39.670 --> 09:41.340
Wait, how does he know that?

09:41.630 --> 09:43.670
He saw the way you walked into camp.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.010
He can tell.

09:45.090 --> 09:46.300
I'm going in anyway.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.100
( INHALES )

09:56.270 --> 09:57.770
Get out!

10:00.730 --> 10:03.480
Master, I need to learn firebending.

10:03.570 --> 10:07.490
Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.280
I am the Avatar.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.030
- It's my destiny to...
- Destiny?

10:11.120 --> 10:13.370
What would a boy know of destiny?

10:13.450 --> 10:16.120
If a fish lives its whole life
in this river,

10:16.200 --> 10:17.960
does he know the river's destiny?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.210
No!

10:19.290 --> 10:22.290
Only that it runs on and on
out of his control.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.000
He may follow where it flows,

10:24.090 --> 10:26.380
but he cannot see the end.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.760
He cannot imagine the ocean.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.090
Ok...

10:31.180 --> 10:32.550
But it's the Avatar's duty

10:32.640 --> 10:34.890
to master all of
the bending disciplines.

10:34.970 --> 10:37.140
To master the bending disciplines,

10:37.230 --> 10:40.060
you must first master
discipline itself.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.900
But you have no interest in this,

10:41.980 --> 10:43.520
so I have no interest in you.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.650
Now, get out.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.280
Please, I have to learn.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.950
This could be my only chance.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.570
Are you deaf?

10:51.660 --> 10:55.030
How can I teach you
if you refuse to listen?

10:55.120 --> 10:56.870
Before learning firebending,

10:56.950 --> 10:59.040
you must learn water and earth.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.170
Water is cool and soothing.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.170
Earth is steady and stable.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.590
But fire...

11:04.670 --> 11:06.380
Fire is alive.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.670
It breathes, it grows.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.340
Without the bender,
a rock will not throw itself.

11:11.550 --> 11:12.840
But fire will spread

11:12.930 --> 11:15.050
and destroy everything in its path

11:15.140 --> 11:17.810
if one does not have
the will to control it!

11:18.310 --> 11:19.680
That is its destiny.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.190
You are not ready!

11:21.270 --> 11:23.270
You are too weak!

11:28.070 --> 11:29.530
You think I am weak?

11:29.610 --> 11:31.280
Avatar Roku!

11:31.360 --> 11:32.490
No, no!

11:32.570 --> 11:33.700
I did not mean that.

with nature.

No fire yet.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.280
Power in firebending
comes from the breath.

That is why you must master
proper breath control.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.040
I had a pupil once

who had no interest

13:46.370 --> 13:49.250
He was only concerned
with the power of fire...

13:49.330 --> 13:51.540
How he could use it
to destroy his opponents

13:51.630 --> 13:54.880
and wipe out the obstacles
in his path,

13:54.960 --> 13:57.880
but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.930
