00:04.605 --> 00:06.340
Hello.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.908
What?
Are those moving boxes?

00:07.941 --> 00:09.143
Is somebody moving out?!
Let me help.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.578
No. No.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.012
It's stuff
I was storing here

00:12.046 --> 00:13.847
because I didn't have room
in my apartment,

00:13.881 --> 00:16.150
but now since I'm moving
into Neville's place,

00:16.184 --> 00:18.086
I got to figure out
what to bring.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.620
No one
ever moves out.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.923
Well, you make it
too nice.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.392
Moldy shower curtains,

00:24.425 --> 00:26.727

of soap chunks smashed into one.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.429
Nobody's leaving that.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.032
Hey!
You look nice.

00:32.066 --> 00:35.035
I'm meeting some friends
at the bar for happy hour.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.205
Are they meeting you
in your coat?

00:37.238 --> 00:40.274
'Cause it seems like
that's where all the
food and drinks are.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.876
Well, even happy-hour prices
are kind of high.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.179
Usually, I'll flirt with a guy
so he buys me drinks,

00:45.213 --> 00:47.681
and then I'll shimmy out the
bathroom window and head home,

00:47.715 --> 00:49.450
but the place tonight
is at a rooftop bar,

00:49.483 --> 00:52.420
and I don't want to fall 20
stories for a pumpkin pale ale.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.525
There's a lot of things
you can take from this house --

00:57.558 --> 00:59.627
books, vegetables,
Jackie.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.930
But if you think I'm spending
the rest of my night

01:02.963 --> 01:06.066
with these people sober,
you are sadly mistaken.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.401
Gimme.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.036
Hm!

01:09.069 --> 01:11.205
Gimme.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.541
I guess I'm back
to flirting for drinks.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.743
You're not getting
any younger. I'd go.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.648
So how come it took you so long
to move in with Neville?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.216
He's an old-fashioned guy.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.917
He felt like living together
before marriage

01:23.951 --> 01:25.819
would make God cry.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.223
And yet he had no problem
with all the premarital sex.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.325
Single guys have
their own religion.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.828
Oh, I tell ya, I tell ya,
God would be inconsolable

01:34.862 --> 01:36.497
if he saw what we were doing
every night

01:36.530 --> 01:39.066
before I said bye-bye
and headed home.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.102
Are you excited to be
moving in with your fella?

01:42.136 --> 01:44.104
Oh. Yeah.
Absolutely.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.639
This is the first time
I'm living with somebody

01:45.673 --> 01:48.008
because we want to
be together, you know?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.411
Not because he stole my key
while I was asleep

01:50.444 --> 01:52.913
and made a copy
at Home Depot.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.115
Oh, my God.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.850
There's stuff from
all different parts

01:56.884 --> 01:59.753
of my life
in these things.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.592
Oh, my God!
My old service taser!

02:04.625 --> 02:08.128
I was looking for this
the last time my mom visited.

02:08.162 --> 02:11.332
Wait! This was just sitting
in the closet for years?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.301
Relax. It was in a box.
It was taped shut.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.968
Oh, there you go.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.205
No kid has ever gotten
through Scotch tape.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.507
That's why they use it on
liquor cabinets and pool gates.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.377
Wow. Well, no wonder
my box was so heavy.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.379
It's filled with books.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.281
Copies of the book
I self-published,

02:27.315 --> 02:30.784

02:30.818 --> 02:32.386
How many of these
did you sell?

02:32.420 --> 02:34.822
Oh, that's not important.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.224
If I helped
one person --

Got it. One.

plastic cow creamer.

for this thing.

I know.
You know what?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.905
Sometimes I even
helped her look for it.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.808
I was gonna slip it into
her casket at the funeral,

02:54.842 --> 02:57.411
but then I thought
I can't let go of that memory

02:57.445 --> 02:59.247
of watching her wander
through the house going,

02:59.280 --> 03:00.681
"Where is that
damn thing?"

03:00.714 --> 03:02.483
[ Laughs ]

You know, for

03:16.730 --> 03:18.499
[ Chuckles ]

03:18.532 --> 03:20.167
I also know where
we're going tonight.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.436
I got tickets to that
new Italian movie.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.438
The one with the sex, huh?
And the food?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.907
And the screaming
and the smoking and the --

03:26.940 --> 03:28.776
Well, you know.
An Italian movie.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.078
Yeah, if I wanted all that,
I'd just hang out

03:31.111 --> 03:33.381
in the alley
behind the high school.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.783
And to keep the
international theme going,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.918
I got a reservation
at the best French restaurant

03:37.951 --> 03:39.753
in Kane County --
Le Maître D'.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.522
You know why they call it that,
don't you?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.357
The last restaurant
was called Le Maître D'

03:43.391 --> 03:45.259
and they didn't feel like
changing the sign.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.530
Well, that is so sweet,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.465
but you don't have to do
all that for me.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.534
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be fun.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.369
You know
what else is fun?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.438
Getting cozy and snuggling up
right here on the couch.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.206
And you know what?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.942
We will take control of the

Yes, we will!

Alright, well,
what about dinner?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.717
I already
took care of it.

At some point, Kenny will be
dropping a contactless delivery

04:13.321 --> 04:16.657
of vegan enchiladas
right at our doorstep.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.392
Oh, he's pulling
out of a weed store,

04:18.426 --> 04:20.060
so we might not get
all of our food,

04:20.093 --> 04:21.929
but some of it's
gotta get here.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.233
Well, we can still have
an international night of sorts,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.236
I guess, and before we go
to our Italian movie,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.639
Kenny will be high
on Jamaican kush,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.907
and then
we'll offend Mexico

by eating what you pretend
are enchiladas.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.239
Oh, I'm so in.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.341
Okay.
Don't get excited.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.708
I got some rules
about your night.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.877
[ Groans ] Such as?

19:37.910 --> 19:41.381
No audience participation
of any kind,

19:41.414 --> 19:45.184
only one thing a year with
the word "festival" in it,

19:45.218 --> 19:47.354
no cover bands...
[ Sighs ]

19:47.387 --> 19:49.956
...and, no, I do not want to
"see all the cool 'merch.'"

19:51.891 --> 19:55.895
But I love my "Hamilton"
three-corner hat.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.564
And if you hadn't
worn it to bed,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.566
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.904
Well, what if I wear it
on my head next time?

20:07.206 --> 20:11.644
**

21:00.627 --> 21:01.561
[ Falsetto voice ]
All are punished, then this

21:02.429 --> 21:05.164
of Juliet and her Romeo.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.066
Ohh!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.836
Hey, hey! That dagger's
not as happy as we are,

21:09.869 --> 21:11.338
'cause you finally
stopped talking!

21:11.371 --> 21:13.773
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, hey!

21:13.806 --> 21:17.143
I was a better Juliet,
and I have a beard!

21:17.176 --> 21:19.979
I had to help
give a duck a suppository,

21:20.012 --> 21:21.548
and this is worse!

21:23.716 --> 21:26.185
[ Normal voice ] That's my
family. They came to support me.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.119
Hey!
