03:14.653 --> 03:16.947
Any signs got my name on them?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.850
Quite a few.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.950
What do they say?

03:22.995 --> 03:24.855
The usual.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.955
'Death to Rosenberg”...

03:26.957 --> 03:28.957
'Retire Rosenberg”...

03:29.668 --> 03:31.668
'Cut off the oxygen. ”

03:32.963 --> 03:34.965
That's my favourite.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.592
Of course, you,
Mr Grantham...

03:39.803 --> 03:43.028
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.228
'Rosenberg equals
the government...

03:46.328 --> 03:47.377
...over business...

03:47.477 --> 03:49.609
...the individual over government,

03:49.709 --> 03:51.840
the environment over everything...

03:51.940 --> 03:53.313
...and the Indians, oh,

03:53.413 --> 03:55.219
give them whatever they want.'

03:55.319 --> 03:56.555
With all due respect,

03:56.655 --> 03:58.931
that wasn't my line,
that was a quote.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.781
From one of your unnamed

04:00.881 --> 04:03.056
Senior White House officials.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.743
Senior White House bastard,

04:04.843 --> 04:06.063
you should have said.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.731
Got in there by...

04:07.831 --> 04:11.581
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.464
Never fails to amaze me...

04:15.672 --> 04:19.384
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.391
Yes?

06:47.491 --> 06:50.494
Looking for Mr Sneller.
Mr Sneller?

06:50.702 --> 06:53.539
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.447
Hello.
Everything is in place.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.511
All the money must be there...

07:29.611 --> 07:30.851
...when I arrive in Zurich.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.912
It will be there
if the job is finished.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.872
It will be finished.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.443
May I help you?

07:43.543 --> 07:45.449
I'd like to order room service.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.874
What would you like?
#NAME?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.937
...scrambled eggs,
whole-wheat toast...

07:50.037 --> 07:51.121
...and orange juice, please.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.582
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.293
When we substitute
threat for an argument...

07:56.393 --> 07:59.630
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

07:59.730 --> 08:01.799
...to overcome our
capacity for reason.

08:01.899 --> 08:05.819
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

08:06.069 --> 08:07.625
...which brings us...

08:07.725 --> 08:09.848
...to Bowers against Hardwick.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.432
A police officer
entered Mr Hardwick's...

08:12.532 --> 08:14.645
...apartment to serve
him a warrant...

08:14.745 --> 08:17.981
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.631
They caught him with an open beer.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.237
When he entered
Mr Hardwick's bedroom...

08:23.337 --> 08:25.887
...he found him in bed with a man.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.200
The officer arrested Hardwick...

08:28.300 --> 08:30.501
...for violating
Georgia's statute...

08:30.601 --> 08:31.829
...which outlaws sodomy.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.206
Even though Georgia
dropped the case...

08:34.306 --> 08:35.813
...Hardwick challenged...

08:35.913 --> 08:38.168
...the constitutionality
of the statute.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.268
Now, what was his claim?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.988
That it violates the
right of privacy.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.088
Why?

08:45.359 --> 08:49.109
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.498
But what if he decided
to sell drugs...

08:52.598 --> 08:55.598
...at his home or
engage in child abuse?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.647
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.858
The court, beginning
with Griswold...

09:00.958 --> 09:02.597
...has limited the
right of privacy...

09:02.697 --> 09:04.069
...to actions which
are intimate...

09:04.169 --> 09:06.199
...which are deeply personal,

09:06.252 --> 09:08.866
which allow us to
control our lives...

09:08.966 --> 09:10.743
...to define who we are.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.646
But is that a
constitutional claim?

09:12.746 --> 09:13.746
There's no...

09:13.846 --> 09:15.284
...right to define oneself...

09:15.384 --> 09:16.874
...written into the Constitution.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.876
It's not even in
the Bill of Rights.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.748
If the State of
Georgia can regulate

09:20.848 --> 09:21.962
Hardwick's sexuality...

09:22.062 --> 09:23.856
...engaged in private
with consenting...

09:23.956 --> 09:25.382
...adults, Hardwick
cannot be free.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.093
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.899
If there's no right of privacy...

09:29.999 --> 09:31.972
...and Georgia can
enforce the statute...

09:32.072 --> 09:34.233
...we sacrifice the
liberty the framers...

09:34.333 --> 09:35.809
...thought they'd guaranteed us.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.061
The Supreme Court
disagreed with you.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.411
They found that the statute...

09:39.511 --> 09:41.064
...did not violate
the right of privacy.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.441
Why?

09:42.541 --> 09:44.541
They're wrong.

10:07.691 --> 10:11.945
So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

10:12.196 --> 10:13.931
Sexual attraction.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.408
You mean he's just got it?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.268
Does he ever.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.978
What you're saying...

10:20.078 --> 10:21.868
...is that if you could clone...

10:21.968 --> 10:23.816
...three of him,
you'd all be happy.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.835
Okay, tell us, what
is your secret?

10:27.044 --> 10:29.219
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.466
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
A very big secret.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.039
My goodness gracious.
I can't believe my ears.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.958
Hope my mom's not watching.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.668
She hopes so too.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.336
Ma, I was just kidding.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.791
Ladies, have you changed...

10:45.891 --> 10:47.297
...your opinion about our stud?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.397
You still like him?

10:49.483 --> 10:51.902
I like big guys.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.686
I think your fan
club has increased.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.738
Everything has increased.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.956
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.133
His nurse was also murdered.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.184
Jensen was found
two hours later...

13:49.284 --> 13:50.314
...in some queer club.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.474
Voyles called me, wildly upset.

13:52.574 --> 13:55.164
It's hardly good for
FBI's reputation.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.893
He and Giminski are on the way.

13:56.993 --> 13:57.446
Giminski?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.310
Yes. The CIA should be involved,

13:59.410 --> 14:00.324
at least for now.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.032
You must wait two
hours to address...

14:03.132 --> 14:05.907
...the nation if we
want an audience.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.361
A coat and tie may
seem a bit rehearsed.

14:08.461 --> 14:09.583
How about a cardigan?

14:09.683 --> 14:12.235
You want me to talk
to the nation in a...

14:12.335 --> 14:14.379
...time of crisis
wearing a sweater?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.479
Mr President...

14:16.940 --> 14:18.822
...I've already told Justice...

14:18.922 --> 14:21.053
...to put together
a list of nominees.

14:21.153 --> 14:24.378
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.615
Mr President.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.159
Mr Voyles,

14:28.259 --> 14:30.187
does the FBI have any suspects?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.688
It's too soon.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.483
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.702
I would like to have a report...

14:36.802 --> 14:39.530
...on your security and
where it broke down.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.880
You're assuming it broke down.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.957
We have two dead
judges, both of whom...

14:45.057 --> 14:47.287
...were being
protected by the FBI.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.627
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.963
Are these killings in any way...

14:52.035 --> 14:53.377
...linked to the CIA...

14:53.477 --> 14:55.477
...or to any other agency...

14:55.522 --> 14:57.714
...of the United
States government?

14:57.814 --> 14:59.716
I'm shocked you'd think that.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.991
Bob, just look into it, okay?

15:02.152 --> 15:04.852
I suggest we meet
back here at five.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.405
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.799
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.283
Your approval ratings will go...

15:20.346 --> 15:21.905
...through the roof.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.200
That's the weather...

15:23.300 --> 15:25.325
...in New Orleans.
This is Tim Bellew.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.994
We interrupt our program now...

15:27.094 --> 15:28.245
...for a special bulletin.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.623
In a special address,
live from the White House...

15:31.723 --> 15:34.573
...the president of
the United States.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.519
My fellow Americans...

15:37.729 --> 15:41.024
...our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.733
Last night...

15:44.194 --> 15:48.282
...Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

15:48.532 --> 15:50.532
...were assassinated.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.107
These assassinations may be an...

15:54.207 --> 15:56.940
...attempt to strike
at the very fabric...

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
...of our government.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.378
But I can assure each...

16:02.212 --> 16:04.212
...and every American...

16:04.214 --> 16:08.039
...that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.955
Everything...

16:12.055 --> 16:16.059
...is being and will be done
to bring the culprit...

16:16.560 --> 16:19.062
...or culprits to justice.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.230
For justice must...

16:22.482 --> 16:24.482
...and shall prevail.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.243
I wish you could have known him...

16:28.343 --> 16:30.224
...when I used to clerk for him.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.549
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.810
That's why they killed him.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.004
That mind was still a threat.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.774
But why kill him now,

16:40.874 --> 16:43.274
when he had so little time left?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.417
Maybe they couldn't
take a chance...

16:45.517 --> 16:47.116
...he'd last till the elections.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.016
So why Jensen?

16:48.116 --> 16:49.827
This president nominated him.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.027
He and Rosenberg had almost...

16:52.086 --> 16:54.086
...nothing in common.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.209
That's what they should look for.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.009
Decisions on which
they both agreed.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.505
Boy, if there ever was a moment...

17:03.605 --> 17:05.605
...for a drink...

17:08.111 --> 17:10.111
One day at a time, right?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.554
We're talking a conspiracy,

17:23.654 --> 17:25.570
then who are the conspirators?

17:25.671 --> 17:28.050
If we've let foreign
terrorists in,

17:28.117 --> 17:30.568
there'll be hell to
pay politically.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.815
The intelligence
community can't be...

17:32.915 --> 17:35.038
...blamed for a weakness
in immigration.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.808
Denton, who are your suspects?

17:38.809 --> 17:41.144
This has to be kept very quiet.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.481
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.983
At least 11 Underground
Army members...

17:49.083 --> 17:51.054
...have been in the D.C. area...

17:51.154 --> 17:53.454
...and we suspect
them in at least...

17:53.554 --> 17:55.726
...100 bombings of
abortion clinics...

17:55.826 --> 17:56.679
...porno houses,

17:56.779 --> 17:58.479
gay clubs all over the country.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.429
The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.293
Correct?

18:07.171 --> 18:09.171
Watch your claws.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.213
Gray Grantham covers the

18:17.313 --> 18:19.833
Supreme Court for the
Washington Herald.

18:19.933 --> 18:23.437
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg...

18:23.854 --> 18:25.317
...before he was shot on,

18:25.417 --> 18:27.424
as it turned out,
the day he died.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.736
Did he say anything
that might shed...

18:29.836 --> 18:31.929
...some light on
these dreadful events?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.806
Yes. He spoke about things...

18:33.906 --> 18:35.330
...off the record,

18:35.430 --> 18:38.327
appropriately for
a sitting justice.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.125
But I think it would
be appropriate...

18:41.167 --> 18:42.272
...to quote him now.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.842
He said, 'The campaign waged...

18:43.942 --> 18:45.609
...by the president
was so ruthless...

18:45.709 --> 18:47.723
...in its manipulation of the...

18:47.823 --> 18:50.030
...middle-class fears
of minorities...

18:50.130 --> 18:52.722
...had been so exploitive
and divisive...

18:52.822 --> 18:55.285
...that it created a
climate of distrust.'

18:55.385 --> 18:59.135
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.095
Everyone wants to know...

19:01.195 --> 19:02.960
...when you're starting
classes again.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.060
That includes me.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.238
You know what they say:

19:08.338 --> 19:10.738
Drinking makes depression worse.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.806
What do they
recommend for anguish?

19:13.906 --> 19:15.139
Where've you been?

19:15.239 --> 19:17.103
The library. I
studied a printout...

19:17.203 --> 19:18.642
...of the Supreme Court docket.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.472
I even made a list of
possible suspects.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.231
And then threw it away...

19:23.331 --> 19:26.406
...because they'd be
obvious to everyone.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.854
Then you looked for areas

19:27.954 --> 19:29.987
Jensen and Rosenberg
had in common.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.280
Exactly.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.187
Jensen generally
protected the rights...

19:34.287 --> 19:35.826
...of criminal defendants.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.494
Some notable exceptions.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.274
He wrote 3 majority opinions...

19:39.374 --> 19:40.998
...protective of the environment.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.900
And almost always supported...

19:43.000 --> 19:43.876
...tax protestors.

19:43.976 --> 19:46.496
So they might have
been assassinated...

19:46.596 --> 19:48.589
...by an insatiable tax collector?

19:48.689 --> 19:50.983
As yet, I rule no one out.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.591
Everyone is assuming the motive...

19:53.691 --> 19:54.845
...is hatred or revenge.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.621
Or an attempt to influence...

19:56.721 --> 19:58.515
...the social agenda of the court.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.017
What if the issue involved...

20:00.117 --> 20:01.518
...old-fashioned material greed?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.768
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

20:04.955 --> 20:06.076
Can I help you?

20:06.176 --> 20:08.780
I'd like to see this file, please.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.527
Why?

20:10.627 --> 20:12.446
It's public record, isn't it?

20:12.546 --> 20:14.546
Semi-public.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.200
Are you familiar with...

20:16.300 --> 20:18.850
...the Freedom of Information Act?

20:19.553 --> 20:21.038
This file has the pleading...

20:21.138 --> 20:22.411
...and correspondence.

20:22.511 --> 20:24.625
The rest is discovery
and the trial.

20:24.725 --> 20:26.376
When was the trial?
Last summer.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.879
Went on for 2 months.
Where's the appeal?

20:28.979 --> 20:30.279
Not perfected yet.

20:30.379 --> 20:33.004
I think the deadline
is August 1st.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.406
So, who done it?

22:05.117 --> 22:07.693
You have some obscure
suspect unknown...

22:07.793 --> 22:09.646
...to the FBI and the CIA and...

22:09.746 --> 22:11.106
...Secret Service...

22:11.206 --> 22:13.317
...and 10,000 police departments?

22:13.417 --> 22:15.417
I had one...

22:15.544 --> 22:17.796
...which I have now discarded.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.679
You skipped class,
ignored me for a...

22:21.723 --> 22:23.577
...week, just to throw it away?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.677
Let me see it.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.229
Don't laugh. It was
ludicrous of me...

22:29.329 --> 22:31.001
...to think I could solve it.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.101
Hubris of the young, huh?

22:33.187 --> 22:35.814
Don't knock the
hubris that I love.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.112
I'm leaving tomorrow.

22:44.865 --> 22:47.525
I'm going up to
Rosenberg's memorial...

22:47.615 --> 22:49.615
...in Washington.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.092
I went through
Rosenberg's decisions...

22:54.192 --> 22:56.192
...the other night...

22:56.668 --> 22:58.908
...and in the back of my mind...

22:58.974 --> 23:00.531
...there's an idea...

23:00.631 --> 23:02.491
...to do a book on him.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.591
No one could do it better.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.138
I started making notes...

23:09.890 --> 23:12.015
...about what he meant to me:

23:12.115 --> 23:14.740
surrogate father,
mentor, you know.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.485
I started to get very thirsty.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.100
I deserted you this week.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
Not the greatest timing.

23:30.494 --> 23:33.719
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.667
It's Alice.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.906
Want to come out with
me for a burger?

23:43.006 --> 23:45.006
No, thanks.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.636
It might do you good to get out.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.428
I'm fine, thanks.

23:50.514 --> 23:52.514
You sure?
Yes.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.059
Okay, bye.

24:00.566 --> 24:01.800
Hey, Sarge.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.900
Hey, son.

24:05.237 --> 24:07.097
Dark coffee, three sugars.

24:07.197 --> 24:09.057
So how's the president?

24:09.157 --> 24:11.157
Which one?

24:11.201 --> 24:12.770
Not Coal, the real one.

24:12.870 --> 24:14.605
Cool and mellow.

24:14.705 --> 24:17.275
Would you believe
he's all tore up...

24:17.375 --> 24:19.375
...about Rosenberg?

24:19.793 --> 24:21.793
And all fired up about...

24:21.962 --> 24:23.962
...restructuring the court.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.866
Thinks it'll make
his place in history.

24:25.966 --> 24:28.591
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

24:28.719 --> 24:31.194
There's a short list of nominees.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.244
The original had 20 or so names,

24:33.344 --> 24:35.626
then they cut it to
8. I gave you 2.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.756
What about the investigation?

24:37.769 --> 24:39.769
I haven't heard much...

24:39.771 --> 24:41.871
...but I'll keep my ears open.

24:41.899 --> 24:44.384
I know you will. Thanks.
#NAME?

24:44.484 --> 24:45.969
I'll see you later.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.069
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.283
Martini, please.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.996
Good day.
Good to see you.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.916
Another coffee, please.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.225
You read the Grantham article.

25:02.294 --> 25:04.769
It had me running around all day.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.373
Coal blasted the
director, saying the...

25:07.473 --> 25:09.660
...judges' names were
leaked by the FBI.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.649
The director said Coal
had leaked them...

25:12.749 --> 25:14.540
...himself to test the waters.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.818
Coal ran the most
divisive campaign...

25:16.918 --> 25:17.918
...in 20 years...

25:18.018 --> 25:20.493
...and the president did nothing.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.276
I'd like to have seen your name...

25:23.376 --> 25:24.716
...on this list of judges.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.104
We all voted you...

25:26.204 --> 25:28.679
...most likely to make the court.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.990
These days, it's hard enough...

25:31.063 --> 25:33.063
...just to make my class.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.742
How old is she, this time?

25:36.620 --> 25:38.956
Twenty-four. But she's...

25:39.289 --> 25:41.289
...extremely mature.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.128
At 24, she's mature.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.052
I don't know if I believe that.

25:47.152 --> 25:48.240
Do you have a photo?

25:48.340 --> 25:50.908
No, I don't. She's
not a puppy dog...

25:51.008 --> 25:52.077
...or a grandchild.

25:52.177 --> 25:54.177
Thank God.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.305
Who killed them, Gavin?

25:57.641 --> 26:00.141
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,

26:00.241 --> 26:01.962
I'm not an agent.

26:02.062 --> 26:04.912
But, as I recall,
you have great ears.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.274
To be honest, we
don't have a clue.

26:10.988 --> 26:14.224
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

26:14.324 --> 26:16.358
...on who might have ordered...

26:16.458 --> 26:17.686
...the assassinations.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.961
Your girlfriend has a theory?

26:21.331 --> 26:24.017
Here, take a look at
it. You'll get...

26:24.117 --> 26:27.117
...a kick out of the
way her mind works.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.192
Is this Gray Grantham?
#NAME?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.633
Sorry to call at
such a crazy hour.

26:50.733 --> 26:53.097
I'm at a pay phone
on my way to work.

26:53.197 --> 26:56.325
I can't call from
home or the office.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.769
What kind of office?

26:58.869 --> 27:00.869
I'm an attorney.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.871
Private or government?

27:02.873 --> 27:04.873
I'd rather not say.

27:05.209 --> 27:06.781
I may know something...

27:06.881 --> 27:09.131
...about Rosenberg and Jensen.

27:09.379 --> 27:11.379
Are you recording this?

27:11.882 --> 27:13.882
Can this call be traced?

27:14.051 --> 27:16.551
I'm not recording
it or tracing it.

27:16.651 --> 27:17.621
I promise you.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.746
I may know who killed them.

27:22.226 --> 27:24.226
What's your name?

27:24.978 --> 27:26.978
Garcia.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.649
That's not your real name.

27:32.861 --> 27:35.586
I think I saw
something at the office

27:35.686 --> 27:37.686
I wasn't supposed to see.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.867
Do you have a copy?

27:43.080 --> 27:45.105
I need to think about this.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.515
I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

27:49.086 --> 27:51.086
Listen, I promise you...

27:52.089 --> 27:55.539
...I will protect you
as a confidential source.

28:02.099 --> 28:04.099
Hello.

28:18.949 --> 28:20.949
Got you.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.175
Mr Grantham's not here,

28:30.275 --> 28:32.900
but he left his
car number for you.

28:35.716 --> 28:36.436
It's Garcia.

28:36.536 --> 28:38.410
I still don't know what to do.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.510
Mr Garcia...

28:40.721 --> 28:44.516
...I've gone to jail
rather than reveal a source.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.892
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

28:49.479 --> 28:52.129
You're clearly a
decent human being,

28:52.229 --> 28:53.383
a good citizen.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.944
But could you live
with yourself...

28:56.044 --> 28:58.819
...if you don't
reveal what you know?

28:59.823 --> 29:01.848
MORGAN I'll get back to you.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.982
Taxi.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.456
French authorities
reviewed footage...

29:45.556 --> 29:47.771
...from the airport
cameras in Paris...

29:47.871 --> 29:49.982
...and think they
recognized a face...

29:50.082 --> 29:52.192
...that might be
Khamel's, the terrorist.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.053
He may have arrived
here on a flight...

29:55.153 --> 29:58.228
...10 hours after we
found Jensen's body.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.007
Anything else?

30:01.093 --> 30:03.093
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

30:05.055 --> 30:06.707
What's the wrinkle?

30:06.807 --> 30:09.960
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.535
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

30:13.063 --> 30:15.487
He's afraid it
might be damaging...

30:15.587 --> 30:17.587
...to the president.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.471
How's that?

30:20.571 --> 30:22.671
It's all there in the brief.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.082
It's amateur stuff...

30:34.084 --> 30:36.104
...but how often
does something make

30:36.204 --> 30:37.821
Coal sweat and run for cover?

30:37.921 --> 30:40.657
He didn't exactly
sweat in front of us.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.627
But his stone face showed
he wasn't happy.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.245
Did he have any symptoms?

30:45.345 --> 30:47.175
As I told you,
the president...

30:47.275 --> 30:49.166
...is here for his
annual check-up.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.043
I wish I was in as good shape.

30:51.143 --> 30:52.439
Was this timed to counter...

30:52.539 --> 30:54.171
...the age issue in
the next election?

30:54.271 --> 30:56.271
Why didn't I think of that?

30:56.273 --> 30:58.467
He hasn't decided
whether to run again.

30:58.567 --> 31:00.344
When will he decide?

31:00.444 --> 31:03.222
Do you really expect
me to answer that?

31:03.322 --> 31:05.064
One rumour I can deny is...

31:05.164 --> 31:07.768
...that he checked in
to get away from you.

31:07.868 --> 31:10.043
Although could you blame him?

31:11.663 --> 31:13.663
Thank you again.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.944
Commander, go downstairs...

31:16.044 --> 31:16.714
...and tell them

31:16.814 --> 31:19.029
I have a date for
golf this afternoon.

31:19.129 --> 31:21.129
Yes, sir.

31:22.090 --> 31:24.493
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

31:24.593 --> 31:27.137
Good.
Now, what's so important?

31:27.971 --> 31:29.540
This is...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.375
...a brief...

31:31.475 --> 31:33.450
...written by an eager-beaver...

31:33.550 --> 31:34.545
...law student.

31:34.645 --> 31:37.570
It's a theory about
the assassinations.

31:38.232 --> 31:39.883
And indirectly...

31:39.983 --> 31:42.458
...it implicates the White House.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.962
The premise is so far-fetched...

31:46.062 --> 31:47.391
...it's absurd.

31:47.491 --> 31:49.551
But Director Voyles,
for reasons...

31:49.651 --> 31:51.228
...both you and I can guess...

31:51.328 --> 31:53.328
...is going after it.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.667
Well, we...

31:58.836 --> 32:01.911
We can't interfere
with his investigation.

32:02.005 --> 32:05.409
You should ask Giminski
to have the CIA investigate.

32:05.509 --> 32:08.234
When we confirm that
this is garbage,

32:08.334 --> 32:10.659
you can ask Voyles to back off.

32:11.181 --> 32:13.181
It's domestic.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.342
The CIA can't go nosing around.

32:16.442 --> 32:17.921
It's illegal.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.021
Yes, technically.

32:22.401 --> 32:23.635
What about...

32:23.735 --> 32:25.345
...your friend...

32:25.445 --> 32:28.866
...Barr, and the Unit,
I think you call it.

32:29.658 --> 32:31.658
I've spoken to Barr.

32:32.035 --> 32:33.013
They're very good...

32:33.113 --> 32:34.605
...for small specific missions...

32:34.705 --> 32:36.730
...but they aren't the CIA.

32:37.541 --> 32:40.341
How does it implicate
the White House?

32:40.441 --> 32:42.112
What are there, names?

32:42.212 --> 32:44.212
One name.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.465
Someone we both know?

33:11.491 --> 33:13.911
Mr President...

33:20.250 --> 33:22.986
I've decided my agenda
for the future.

33:23.086 --> 33:25.214
I'll stay in bed...

33:25.839 --> 33:27.839
...drink...

33:28.091 --> 33:30.091
...make love...

33:31.136 --> 33:33.986
...and forget the
whole damn business.

33:35.807 --> 33:37.807
You don't approve.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.712
What about the book on Rosenberg?

33:40.812 --> 33:42.812
You should write it.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.815
Let's go.
#NAME?

33:45.943 --> 33:48.218
You have the youth, the energy,

33:48.318 --> 33:49.221
the certitude.

33:49.321 --> 33:51.321
You'd be perfect.

33:51.782 --> 33:53.782
Can I have the keys?

33:59.164 --> 34:01.834
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

34:02.543 --> 34:04.543
You've drunk too much.

34:08.549 --> 34:10.549
Give me the keys.

34:11.844 --> 34:13.550
Remember the Mashed Potato?

34:13.650 --> 34:14.705
Give me the keys.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.665
You're too young.
#NAME?

34:16.764 --> 34:19.016
Do you remember the Fishback?

34:19.309 --> 34:21.311
The Slide?
#NAME?

34:21.562 --> 34:23.887
Please what?
#NAME?

34:23.981 --> 34:27.056
Give me the keys.
I'll drive or I'll walk.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.150
You'll walk?
Yes.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.321
Have a nice stroll.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.083
Miss Shaw.

34:46.795 --> 34:50.591
You take my breath away.

34:56.847 --> 34:58.847
Thomas.

35:01.185 --> 35:03.520
Oh, my God.

35:22.623 --> 35:24.623
Watch the door.

35:27.961 --> 35:30.589
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

35:31.882 --> 35:33.884
You'll be safe in my car.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.472
Your name?

35:47.397 --> 35:49.397
Darby Shaw.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.445
Let's go.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.162
Is this your car?

36:07.417 --> 36:09.417
Come here.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.195
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.956
I'm taking you to the hospital.

36:15.592 --> 36:17.592
Check the plates.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.870
Did you know the man in the car?

36:26.270 --> 36:28.270
Thomas Callahan.

36:39.283 --> 36:41.283
It'll be a few minutes.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.203
Are you sure that the man who...

36:45.303 --> 36:48.528
...called himself Rupert
said he was a cop?

36:52.296 --> 36:54.105
We don't have a record of a cop...

36:54.205 --> 36:55.741
...named Rupert.
The computer...

36:55.841 --> 36:58.743
...has no record of
the tag numbers of...

36:58.843 --> 37:01.618
...the car you were
in. Must be fake.

37:02.723 --> 37:05.273
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

37:05.642 --> 37:07.642
All right?

40:14.873 --> 40:16.873
Gavin Verheek?

40:17.167 --> 40:19.967
This is Darby Shaw.
Do you know who I am?

40:20.003 --> 40:22.631
We have a mutual friend.

40:23.006 --> 40:25.706
Thomas gave you a
copy of my theory.

40:25.843 --> 40:27.077
Yes, he did.

40:27.177 --> 40:29.177
Where is it?

40:29.179 --> 40:30.792
I read it and I showed it...

40:30.892 --> 40:32.624
...to some folks at the Bureau...

40:32.724 --> 40:35.104
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

40:35.185 --> 40:37.885
Has it been seen
outside of the FBI?

40:37.896 --> 40:39.896
I can't answer that.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.707
Then I won't tell you...

40:41.807 --> 40:43.982
...what's happened to Thomas.

40:44.862 --> 40:46.680
Okay, yes.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.055
It's been seen outside the FBI,

40:49.155 --> 40:51.155
but by whom I don't know.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.353
He's dead, Gavin.

40:53.453 --> 40:55.356
He was murdered.
Someone planted...

40:55.456 --> 40:56.857
...a car bomb for both of us.

40:56.957 --> 40:59.507
I got lucky, but they're after me.

41:01.712 --> 41:03.229
What's your phone number?

41:03.329 --> 41:04.156
Where are you?

41:04.256 --> 41:06.256
Not so fast.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.393
Come on. Thomas Callahan...

41:08.493 --> 41:10.162
...was my best friend.

41:10.262 --> 41:12.292
I'll have agents pick you up.

41:12.368 --> 41:14.398
You can't stay on the street.

41:14.474 --> 41:16.640
Thomas is dead
because he talked...

41:16.740 --> 41:18.462
...to you. Tell that to Voyles.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.837
Turn up the TV,

41:20.937 --> 41:23.487
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

41:25.903 --> 41:27.903
Down.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.826
Mr President.

41:35.329 --> 41:37.329
Sit down. You must see this.

41:37.342 --> 41:40.025
We've been working
on this all morning.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.155
You have your first audience.

41:42.252 --> 41:44.421
Over. Roll over.

41:46.006 --> 41:47.408
Roll over.

41:47.508 --> 41:50.058
How serious is this Pelican thing?

41:50.844 --> 41:53.330
I've assigned 14
agents in New Orleans.

41:53.430 --> 41:55.534
I doubt if there's anything to it,

41:55.634 --> 41:57.167
but we must check it out.

41:57.267 --> 41:59.267
I don't have to tell you...

41:59.269 --> 42:01.183
...how much trouble and pain...

42:01.283 --> 42:03.006
...this nonsense could cause...

42:03.106 --> 42:05.346
...if the press gets wind of it.

42:05.442 --> 42:08.612
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

42:11.114 --> 42:12.850
I just wish...

42:12.950 --> 42:14.518
...that you'd...

42:14.618 --> 42:16.618
...back off the thing...

42:17.454 --> 42:18.689
I mean...

42:18.789 --> 42:20.874
...it's a goose chase.

42:21.124 --> 42:23.849
Are you asking me to
ignore a suspect,

42:23.949 --> 42:25.949
Mr President?

42:26.255 --> 42:27.906
If the press...

42:28.006 --> 42:29.659
...gets wind of what
you're after...

42:29.759 --> 42:31.034
...and starts digging, I'll be-

42:31.134 --> 42:33.134
We'll be crucified.

42:37.808 --> 42:40.208
So you're asking me to back off?

42:43.981 --> 42:46.756
Back off and chase
the real suspects.

42:47.484 --> 42:50.334
Ignore it for a few
weeks, that's all.

42:51.029 --> 42:53.536
Your hatchet man did
a real number on me...

42:53.636 --> 42:55.726
...with the press.
They ate my lunch...

42:55.826 --> 42:57.394
...over the security...

42:57.494 --> 43:00.194
...we provided Jensen
and Rosenberg.

43:01.373 --> 43:03.723
Get that pit bull off my ass and

43:03.823 --> 43:06.748
I'll forget the
Pelican theory a while.

45:27.019 --> 45:29.019
May I have your card?

45:30.022 --> 45:32.022
I'll pay with cash.

45:34.318 --> 45:36.318
Verheek.
Yes.

45:37.237 --> 45:39.239
What did Voyles say?

45:40.490 --> 45:43.035
Mr Voyles has been unavailable.

45:43.327 --> 45:45.637
But I will try to speak to him...

45:45.715 --> 45:47.715
...later this afternoon.

45:49.333 --> 45:51.333
I expected more.

45:51.543 --> 45:54.243
There's a memorial
service tomorrow.

45:54.254 --> 45:56.465
I'll be there tonight.

45:56.673 --> 45:58.673
I think we should meet.

45:58.842 --> 46:01.261
Darby, I can save your life.

46:02.179 --> 46:04.879
You can't even talk
to the director.

46:07.684 --> 46:09.684
Where will you stay?

46:10.103 --> 46:12.523
At the Westin, by the river.

46:15.192 --> 46:17.192
Okay.

46:44.555 --> 46:46.555
She's watching TV.

46:47.057 --> 46:48.877
They've been looking under...

46:48.977 --> 46:50.461
...rocks. She's
using credit cards.

46:50.561 --> 46:52.586
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

46:52.729 --> 46:54.729
I'll give her 72.

46:55.899 --> 46:57.968
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

46:58.068 --> 47:00.068
All right, Bob.

47:00.612 --> 47:02.612
Hooten, stay.

47:08.745 --> 47:12.249
This means her little brief
is right on point.

47:13.542 --> 47:15.792
Will you notify the president?

47:16.336 --> 47:18.530
Notifying the president...

47:18.630 --> 47:20.632
...means notifying Coal.

47:21.258 --> 47:22.827
Gray Grantham's article...

47:22.927 --> 47:24.995
...in tomorrow's
Washington Herald...

47:25.095 --> 47:26.370
...maintains that, according...

47:26.470 --> 47:27.831
...to unnamed White
House sources...

47:27.931 --> 47:30.591
...the Mid-Eastern
terrorist, Khamel...

47:30.601 --> 47:33.191
...may be among those
who assassinated

47:33.229 --> 47:35.214
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

47:35.314 --> 47:37.853
Those sources say that
a country known...

47:37.953 --> 47:40.177
...for sponsoring
terrorist activity...

47:40.277 --> 47:42.277
...may have hired Khamel.

47:47.492 --> 47:48.685
It's Garcia.

47:48.785 --> 47:50.030
I'm on the corner of

47:50.130 --> 47:52.022
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

47:52.122 --> 47:54.023
Take down my license number;...

47:54.123 --> 47:56.527
...there's a lot of
grey Volvos out there.

47:56.627 --> 47:58.627
8-5-6...

47:59.630 --> 48:01.630
...V-N-N.

48:03.634 --> 48:05.202
Right.

48:05.302 --> 48:07.302
Ten minutes.
Yes.

48:14.311 --> 48:16.311
My keys.

48:21.318 --> 48:23.318
I can't do it.

48:25.739 --> 48:28.158
Let's get together anyway.

48:29.660 --> 48:31.242
You'll feel better if we meet...

48:31.342 --> 48:33.230
...and you don't have
to reveal anything.

48:33.330 --> 48:35.355
I have a wife and daughter.

48:35.999 --> 48:38.402
There's a chance they
know that I know.

48:38.502 --> 48:40.070
The guys at the firm?

48:40.170 --> 48:42.720
I didn't tell you I was in a firm.

48:43.173 --> 48:46.326
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

48:46.426 --> 48:49.747
You must work at a firm
where they expect people...

48:49.847 --> 48:52.622
...to work at least
100 hours a week.

49:12.369 --> 49:14.975
Garcia, we can work
this thing out...

49:15.075 --> 49:17.775
...if you just get
together with me.

49:17.875 --> 49:19.875
Garcia?

49:21.044 --> 49:22.613
Who's this?

49:22.713 --> 49:24.713
Is this Gray Grantham?

49:24.715 --> 49:26.715
Yes. Who's this?

49:27.593 --> 49:30.293
Have you heard of
the Pelican Brief?

49:30.554 --> 49:32.206
The what?

49:32.306 --> 49:34.306
Pelican Brief.

49:37.269 --> 49:39.269
No. Never heard of it.

49:39.396 --> 49:41.161
It's an unlikely little theory...

49:41.261 --> 49:43.300
...about who killed
Rosenberg and Jensen.

49:43.400 --> 49:45.886
A friend of mine took
it to Washington.

49:45.986 --> 49:47.822
He gave it to a
friend in the FBI...

49:47.922 --> 49:49.181
...and it was passed around.

49:49.281 --> 49:51.906
My friend was killed
in a car bomb.

49:52.576 --> 49:54.576
Wait now.

49:54.745 --> 49:57.289
Your friend took it to the FBI...

49:57.581 --> 50:00.731
...and then he was killed?
What's his name?

50:01.752 --> 50:03.752
I can't tell you that.

50:04.588 --> 50:06.757
How do you know all this?

50:07.257 --> 50:09.257
I wrote the brief.

50:10.844 --> 50:12.496
Are you a lawyer?

50:12.596 --> 50:14.596
No.

50:15.098 --> 50:17.123
Where are you calling from?

50:17.768 --> 50:19.192
I'd rather you not...

50:19.292 --> 50:21.467
...ask me any more questions.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.480
You called me.

50:23.482 --> 50:25.482
What's your name?

50:25.484 --> 50:27.945
Alice.
#NAME?

50:29.363 --> 50:31.752
Can you get a list of the major...

50:31.852 --> 50:34.442
...presidential
campaign contributors?

50:34.535 --> 50:37.287
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

50:38.956 --> 50:41.356
You know who did these killings?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Yes.

50:45.295 --> 50:47.845
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

50:48.298 --> 50:50.701
Let's take it slow.
I'll be in touch.

50:50.801 --> 50:52.801
When?

51:25.794 --> 51:27.154
Hi.

51:27.254 --> 51:28.906
How are you?

51:29.006 --> 51:31.006
How are you?

51:32.885 --> 51:35.135
Did you get into my apartment?

51:35.846 --> 51:37.846
Your computer's gone.

51:38.432 --> 51:40.000
So are your floppy disks.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.352
And your red expandable files.

51:44.855 --> 51:47.030
I need you to do me a favour.

51:47.941 --> 51:50.791
Go to the memorial
service tomorrow...

51:51.528 --> 51:54.183
...and spread the
word I called to say

51:54.283 --> 51:56.725
I'm staying with
an aunt in Denver.

51:56.825 --> 51:59.150
And I won't be back until fall.

52:01.371 --> 52:03.371
What is going on?

52:07.961 --> 52:09.961
Are you okay about money?

52:11.381 --> 52:14.006
I have the money
my father left me.

52:16.637 --> 52:18.637
Who are you hiding from?

52:23.727 --> 52:26.202
I think you better go now, Alice.

52:33.487 --> 52:36.490
It would be better
for me if you go now.

52:54.424 --> 52:56.424
That's not fair.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.260
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,

52:59.360 --> 53:01.760
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

53:02.432 --> 53:05.057
I can't get you to
give me a smile?

53:10.524 --> 53:12.176
I saw that.

53:12.276 --> 53:14.276
That's something.

53:22.202 --> 53:24.202
Just one beer?
No.

53:26.123 --> 53:28.373
I've found my mission in life.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.027
To make you smile.

53:30.127 --> 53:32.377
You must find another mission.

53:41.013 --> 53:43.013
Wait.

53:43.140 --> 53:45.915
Will you marry me,
just for 5 minutes?

53:45.934 --> 53:47.026
I know it's stupid,

53:47.126 --> 53:49.421
but I think we're
fated for each other.

53:49.521 --> 53:51.090
I must go now.

53:51.190 --> 53:54.635
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

53:54.735 --> 53:56.862
I'd walk a million miles

53:57.154 --> 53:59.154
For one of your smiles

53:59.323 --> 54:00.766
You beautiful

54:00.866 --> 54:02.392
You wonderful girl

54:02.492 --> 54:04.745
From the laundry

54:07.831 --> 54:09.831
You've got the wrong girl.

54:12.085 --> 54:14.085
Go get her.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.992
Please, help me.

55:34.042 --> 55:35.861
Looking for Mr Sneller.

55:35.961 --> 55:37.321
Mr Sneller?

55:37.421 --> 55:39.965
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

56:33.465 --> 56:35.045
Have you heard from Darby?

56:35.145 --> 56:36.547
Yes, I did.

56:36.647 --> 56:37.945
I got a note from her.

56:38.045 --> 56:40.384
She's staying with
an aunt in Colorado.

56:40.484 --> 56:43.529
But she's going to
be back next semester.

56:55.499 --> 56:57.499
I'll see you later.

57:23.151 --> 57:25.151
Gavin, it's Darby.

57:26.363 --> 57:28.866
I'd just about given up on you.

57:29.867 --> 57:31.477
Tell me where you want to meet...

57:31.577 --> 57:32.936
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

57:33.036 --> 57:35.272
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

57:35.372 --> 57:38.522
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

57:38.750 --> 57:40.868
We can get you out
of the city tonight,

57:40.968 --> 57:42.196
in Washington tomorrow.

57:42.296 --> 57:44.715
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

57:44.923 --> 57:46.923
We'll go from there.

57:47.176 --> 57:48.191
At noon tomorrow,

57:48.291 --> 57:50.120
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.220
Wait, Riverwalk?

57:52.472 --> 57:55.997
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

57:56.393 --> 57:59.393
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

57:59.438 --> 58:01.215
...and I'll find you.

58:01.315 --> 58:03.315
The riverside bandstand.

58:05.235 --> 58:07.321
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.098
Your weight?

58:09.198 --> 58:10.198
About 180,

58:10.298 --> 58:11.975
but I'm planning on losing it.

58:12.075 --> 58:14.075
I'll see you tomorrow.

58:14.077 --> 58:16.077
Tomorrow.

01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:38.136
Gavin, it's Darby.

01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:40.588
I'd just about given up on you.

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.701
Tell me where you want to meet...

01:00:43.794 --> 01:00:45.796
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:48.565
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:51.258
It's not involved, not yet.

01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:53.303
I have friends.

01:00:53.403 --> 01:00:55.993
We'll get you out of
the city tonight,

01:00:56.015 --> 01:00:57.516
in Washington tomorrow.

01:00:57.616 --> 01:00:59.993
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:02.312
We'll go from there.

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:03.690
At noon tomorrow,

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.083
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:11.071
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.660
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.825
...and I'll find you.

01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.925
The riverside bandstand?

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.429
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:22.916
Your weight?

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.016
About 180,

01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:26.366
but I'm planning on losing it.

01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:29.271
All right.

01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:35.877
Tell me where you want to meet...

01:01:37.698 --> 01:01:40.017
Tell me where you want to meet...

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:41.642
...and within an hour

01:01:41.742 --> 01:01:44.142
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:21.004
Mr Sneller on line 2.

01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:28.717
Khamel is dead.
We don't know who did it.

01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:31.167
And the girl?
- She's running.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.475
We lost her.
We'll find her.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.133
There's been another murder.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:54.302
You remember my friend gave...

01:05:54.395 --> 01:05:57.095
...the brief to a
friend at the FBI?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.700
The FBI friend was
killed yesterday.

01:06:02.546 --> 01:06:04.546
How do you know?

01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:07.910
I was holding his hand.
He was shot...

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.345
...in broad daylight in a crowd.

01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:14.014
I'm very sorry.

01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:16.752
I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

01:06:16.852 --> 01:06:20.302
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:23.282
We get crank calls from
people claiming...

01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:25.969
...to know who killed
Rosenberg and Jensen.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:28.069
Something you can confirm?

01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:29.556
Please.

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.656
Such as?

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.812
The name of the friend...

01:06:33.912 --> 01:06:37.062
...that was murdered
in the car explosion.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.082
Take your time.

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:44.169
Callahan.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:47.157
His first name?

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.659
Thomas.

01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:50.759
Where did it happen?

01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:52.169
In New Orleans.

01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:54.519
I think that should be enough.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.392
All right.

01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:03.428
What's the name of the friend...

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.519
...that worked at the FBI?

01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:07.594
Verheek.

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:09.694
Gavin Verheek.

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.113
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:14.724
I think that's more than enough.

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:18.439
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:21.124
You must follow my instructions.

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:37.347
This is Gray Grantham.

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.726
That's right.

01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:47.148
Got it.

01:08:02.749 --> 01:08:05.074
Did you follow my instructions?

01:08:05.669 --> 01:08:07.669
Yes.

01:08:37.826 --> 01:08:39.826
You must think I'm crazy.

01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:43.287
Yes, I did...

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:47.041
...till I checked New Orleans.

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.502
Callahan was...

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.921
...killed exactly as you said.

01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:55.469
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI...

01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:58.419
...they found his
body 2 days ago...

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:01.514
...in a hotel room
early in the morning.

01:09:02.935 --> 01:09:05.635
He'd been dead for
at least 8 hours.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:09.481
That can't be.

01:09:11.443 --> 01:09:13.618
Want to talk about the brief?

01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:19.098
Everyone I've told
about the brief is dead.

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.910
I'll take my chances.

01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:25.488
You can't, under
any circumstances,

01:09:25.587 --> 01:09:26.817
use my name...

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:29.569
...or reveal how you got
the information.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.356
Or publish anything until

01:09:31.456 --> 01:09:33.555
I've left the country. Agreed?

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.576
Unless I can convince
you otherwise.

01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:37.676
You can't.

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:42.889
May I sit down?

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:48.185
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:01.869
Interesting read, isn't it?

01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:05.996
What'd the president say?

01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:08.707
He spoke to Voyles...

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:12.927
...who will leave it
alone for a while.

01:10:13.297 --> 01:10:16.222
The president asked
Voyles to back off?

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.896
We thought it was
just another shot...

01:10:18.996 --> 01:10:20.871
...in the dark.
Now I'm not sure.

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.956
That's obstruction of justice.

01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:26.056
Assuming the brief
turns out to be true.

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:28.893
If it does, you'll
be the fall guy.

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.274
I won't be the only one.

01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.568
The old Nixon two-step.

01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:39.304
Don't even think that name.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:42.643
Look at the hopeful side,
Iran gate, Iraq gate...

01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:44.993
Good chance it won't come out.

01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:48.038
What's up with Grantham?

01:10:48.624 --> 01:10:49.966
We got his car phone.

01:10:50.066 --> 01:10:52.403
We haven't been
inside the home yet.

01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:54.071
Why not?

01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:57.246
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:03.847
Grantham knows about the brief.

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:07.281
He called 3 White
House aides today...

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.434
...and God knows who else.

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:11.595
What made you hone in...

01:11:11.695 --> 01:11:14.285
...on this particular
case so quickly?

01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:16.161
I remembered this piece...

01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:19.036
...that 'Frontline'
did a year ago...

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:24.155
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:27.502
They said he'd committed suicide,

01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:30.602
but his family thought
it was foul play.

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:38.337
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:39.882
They said he had...

01:11:39.982 --> 01:11:42.703
...a depressive
problem years before...

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:45.728
...but medication
had taken care of it.

01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:50.090
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:52.486
They told the police...

01:11:52.586 --> 01:11:55.736
...they were not
convinced it was suicide.

01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:00.618
But the police
closed the investigation.

01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.489
Exactly.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.624
That's it.
That's the brief.

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:19.129
Maybe we could...

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.425
...finish up in the morning?

01:12:33.145 --> 01:12:35.631
I'll be up late going
over my notes...

01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:38.281
...while they're fresh in my head.

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:41.693
Call me when you wake up.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.073
Try and get some sleep.

01:12:55.918 --> 01:12:57.918
Mr Grantham.

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:03.381
I know it sounds silly, but...

01:13:04.968 --> 01:13:07.293
...would you sleep on the sofa?

01:13:11.975 --> 01:13:13.975
No problem.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:22.442
Good night.

01:13:22.945 --> 01:13:24.945
Listen...

01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.947
At the risk of sounding
old-fashioned...

01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:31.083
...isn't it time I
knew your real name?

01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:35.705
Darby Shaw.

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:39.309
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

01:13:42.714 --> 01:13:44.714
Callahan was a fan.

01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:57.057
Does the name Victor Mattiece...

01:13:57.157 --> 01:13:58.422
...mean anything to you?

01:13:58.522 --> 01:13:59.631
Money.

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.731
Power.

01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:03.733
Influence.

01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:06.272
He's made and lost several...

01:14:06.372 --> 01:14:09.222
...fortunes drilling
oil in Louisiana.

01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:12.492
In 1979...

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:14.785
...his oil company
punched some holes...

01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.732
...in Terrebonne
Parish and hit oil.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:18.650
A lot of oil.

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.200
He needed governmental
permission...

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:23.536
...to dredge a channel though...

01:14:23.636 --> 01:14:26.156
...the marshlands
to get the oil out.

01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:27.202
Enter Mattiece,

01:14:27.302 --> 01:14:29.620
the great campaign contributor...

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.205
...and as night follows day...

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:33.189
...government permission...

01:14:33.289 --> 01:14:36.514
...to gouge through
the endangered marshes.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.922
Mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars...

01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:41.548
...when Green Fund...

01:14:41.648 --> 01:14:43.801
...an obscure
environmental outfit...

01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:46.233
...trots down to the
U.S. District court...

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.222
...in Lafayette and
files a lawsuit...

01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:50.722
...to stop the entire operation.

01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:53.460
Of course, Mattiece
spares no expense...

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.686
...to win the lawsuit.

01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:57.156
I don't think there's
a top law firm...

01:14:57.256 --> 01:14:59.316
...between Houston
and New Orleans...

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.416
...that he hasn't hired.

01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.877
Fucking PBS.

01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:07.071
By the time the
Green Fund lawyers...

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:08.325
...all two of them...

01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:10.494
...wade in, the joint ventures...

01:15:10.594 --> 01:15:12.113
...limited partnerships...

01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:13.914
...and corporate associations...

01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:15.990
...form an impenetrable maze...

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:18.001
...that makes Mattiece invisible.

01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.761
Luckily for the Green
Fund's lawsuit...

01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:23.225
...the heart of the
new oil reserve...

01:15:23.325 --> 01:15:25.759
...is near a natural
refuge for waterfowl:

01:15:25.859 --> 01:15:30.239
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.033
The pelican becomes the hero.

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.663
After 30 years of contamination...

01:15:35.763 --> 01:15:38.238
...by DDT and other pesticides...

01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:40.422
...the Louisiana
brown pelican is...

01:15:40.522 --> 01:15:41.859
...on the brink of extinction.

01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:45.154
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts...

01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:48.949
...from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:51.779
It takes 7 years for
the pelican suit...

01:15:51.816 --> 01:15:53.871
...to go to trial in Lake Charles.

01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:55.882
The 3-man jury,
caring less...

01:15:55.982 --> 01:15:57.958
...about the pelicans than jobs...

01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:00.383
...votes in favour of Mattiece.

01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:03.218
But the judge rules to keep the...

01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:05.549
...injunction against
drilling because...

01:16:05.649 --> 01:16:07.432
...he thinks Green
Fund has proven...

01:16:07.532 --> 01:16:08.969
...its point about the pelican...

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:11.494
...a federally-protected species,

01:16:11.594 --> 01:16:13.594
and that it will appeal.

01:16:13.657 --> 01:16:15.757
What's the lawsuit's status?

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:18.020
From the trial level...

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.710
...it will be appealed
to the Court...

01:16:20.803 --> 01:16:23.317
...of Appeals in New
Orleans in a month.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:25.657
Any idea what the court will do?

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:27.669
It could be reversed.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.550
Then the fun starts.
If either side...

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.576
...is unhappy with the court...

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:34.995
...they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:37.404
From today, how long
would it take...

01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:39.750
...for a decision by
the Supreme Court?

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.019
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:44.269
Rosenberg would have died.

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:46.582
But another president could be...

01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:48.801
...in the White
House when he died.

01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:50.594
So if you're Mattiece...

01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:52.478
...and you don't mind killing...

01:16:52.578 --> 01:16:53.847
...a couple of Supremes...

01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:55.608
...now's the time to kill them,

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.810
when you can predict
their replacement.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.394
But why Jensen?

01:16:59.494 --> 01:17:00.797
He shared one piece...

01:17:00.897 --> 01:17:02.815
...of common ground
with Rosenberg:

01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:04.940
Protecting the environment.

01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.251
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:17:57.553 --> 01:18:00.444
You said that Mattiece
hired law firms...

01:18:00.544 --> 01:18:02.869
...from Houston to New Orleans.

01:18:03.475 --> 01:18:05.650
Were there any in Washington?

01:18:06.562 --> 01:18:08.562
Maybe two.

01:18:10.023 --> 01:18:12.023
White & Blazevich...

01:18:14.278 --> 01:18:16.780
...and Brim,
Stearns & Somebody.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240
Great.

01:18:20.242 --> 01:18:22.811
I got a call from
a lawyer in D.C...

01:18:22.911 --> 01:18:24.127
...who saw something...

01:18:24.227 --> 01:18:25.939
...concerning
Rosenberg and Jensen.

01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:28.069
He backed out of our meeting.

01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:30.197
I never heard from him again.

01:18:30.294 --> 01:18:33.744
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:35.491
How?

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:38.461
Long story. If he works
at one of these...

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:41.163
...law firms, he could
be our confirmation.

01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:43.263
I hope you find him.

01:18:44.474 --> 01:18:46.499
Come with me to Washington.

01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:50.729
I've had enough.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.112
If you're right about Mattiece,

01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:54.718
then there'll be a cover-up.

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:56.512
It'll probably work.

01:18:56.612 --> 01:18:58.305
How do you know?

01:18:58.405 --> 01:19:01.255
I called the Herald
morgue last night.

01:19:01.617 --> 01:19:04.542
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:06.111
...on 'Violations of

01:19:06.211 --> 01:19:08.211
Campaign Financing Laws.'

01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:10.307
He found out that,
hidden under...

01:19:10.407 --> 01:19:12.528
...a lot of other
names of individuals...

01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:14.728
...and PAC's and corporations,

01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:17.533
Mattiece was the
biggest contributor...

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:18.992
...by far...

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:20.994
...to the president's campaign.

01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:23.349
We ran a picture,
with the article,

01:19:23.449 --> 01:19:25.374
of the president and Mattiece.

01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:28.252
It was taken unbeknownst
to either one.

01:19:28.352 --> 01:19:30.110
In it, the president
and Mattiece are...

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:31.922
...in front of Mattiece's
hunting lodge...

01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:33.640
...sipping on some bourbon,

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.925
having a good laugh.

01:19:35.025 --> 01:19:36.677
The best of pals.

01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:37.793
The captions said:

01:19:37.893 --> 01:19:39.680
'The President's Most Secret...

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.366
...and Generous Contributor.'

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.482
Now if your brief is right...

01:19:45.582 --> 01:19:47.771
...and it ever reaches
the light of day...

01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:50.607
...the president loses
any chance of re-election.

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.306
The men around the president...

01:19:52.406 --> 01:19:53.527
...won't let that happen.

01:19:53.627 --> 01:19:55.322
I checked with my sources.

01:19:55.422 --> 01:19:58.082
The Bureau, Langley,
the White House...

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.790
...all said the
brief doesn't exist.

01:20:02.678 --> 01:20:05.191
You may be the only
witness to the fact...

01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:07.499
...there is a brief.
If you disappear...

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:09.599
...so does justice.

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:15.204
Is that what Callahan would want?

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:21.260
He'd want me to see
my 25th birthday.

01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:24.558
Darby.

01:20:24.658 --> 01:20:26.556
If this thing reaches as deep...

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:28.979
...and goes as high as
we think it does...

01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:32.079
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.110
Where can you hide?

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.210
Go back to Washington.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.175
They're all shook up...

01:20:48.275 --> 01:20:50.501
...about you asking
about something.

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:51.752
I expected that.

01:20:51.852 --> 01:20:53.463
It's like the Gestapo over there.

01:20:53.563 --> 01:20:54.671
Coal clears everything.

01:20:54.771 --> 01:20:56.634
They put me on medical leave...

01:20:56.734 --> 01:20:57.424
...for 90 days.

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:59.843
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

01:20:59.943 --> 01:21:03.543
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:05.680
I'm worried about you, son.

01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:11.688
Gray, it's Darby.

01:21:11.788 --> 01:21:14.664
When you hear this,
I'll be in the air...

01:21:14.764 --> 01:21:16.764
...on my way to nowhere.

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:19.669
Try to understand.

01:21:20.756 --> 01:21:23.081
I can't keep you on that story.

01:21:23.217 --> 01:21:25.217
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.260
The Times, the networks...

01:21:27.262 --> 01:21:29.382
...are there checking
out the judge...

01:21:29.482 --> 01:21:30.916
...they're about to nominate.

01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.459
I need more time.

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:33.710
For what?

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.317
You lost your White House sources,

01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:38.817
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:40.982
Not your best week.

01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:44.127
You can't take me off this story.

01:21:45.656 --> 01:21:47.224
What do you know for fact?

01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.891
An unidentified guy says...

01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:50.978
...he knows about
the assassinations.

01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:53.506
He works in a law
firm, you don't know...

01:21:53.606 --> 01:21:55.732
...which one. He's
cut off all contact.

01:21:55.832 --> 01:21:58.001
That's not very promising.

01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:01.502
There's something
there, I can smell it.

01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:04.606
Evidence based on
olfactory prowess is...

01:22:04.706 --> 01:22:07.035
...inadmissible, in
case you didn't know.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:08.579
Then there's a girl...

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:10.244
...with her bird
brief for which...

01:22:10.344 --> 01:22:11.540
...you can't get confirmation.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.708
Not yet.

01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:14.841
She also cut off
contact, something...

01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:16.920
...that's reaching
epidemic proportions.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.089
They're waiting for you upstairs.

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:21.189
Everything she said about...

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.635
...the two deaths
has been confirmed.

01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:25.625
The FBI says Verheek was killed...

01:22:25.725 --> 01:22:26.930
...in some hotel mugging.

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:29.391
That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.788
And they said they knew of...

01:22:30.888 --> 01:22:32.603
...no connection with
the assassinations.

01:22:32.703 --> 01:22:34.441
What else would they say?

01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:37.065
I'm interested in
what they did say.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:39.865
Let's look at what
I have confirmed.

01:22:39.877 --> 01:22:41.150
Callahan was killed.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.781
He was a professor.
They had an affair.

01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:45.505
Give it to the Times-Picayune.

01:22:45.605 --> 01:22:47.117
Maybe they want some gossip.

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:48.797
I also found that
Callahan clerked...

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.037
...for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

01:22:50.137 --> 01:22:52.456
Life is filled with
odd coincidence.

01:22:52.556 --> 01:22:54.291
Not a coincidence if the brief-

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.794
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

01:22:56.894 --> 01:22:58.687
I confirmed Verheek
and Callahan...

01:22:58.787 --> 01:22:59.421
...were friends.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.396
They met here a few weeks ago,

01:23:01.496 --> 01:23:03.884
when he must have
given him the brief.

01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:04.835
Supposition again.

01:23:04.935 --> 01:23:06.637
I've confirmed the
pelican lawsuit.

01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:09.615
On which she has based
her suppositions.

01:23:09.715 --> 01:23:11.740
It's all just suppositions.

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:13.685
You know what Mattiece could do?

01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:15.813
I know what he has done already.

01:23:15.913 --> 01:23:17.731
He has a bizarre history.

01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:19.400
So do I, according
to my ex-wife. It...

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.110
...doesn't mean that
I killed the Justices.

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:23.760
But it means it's worth exploring.

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:27.902
Go down to that crappy
cabin of yours...

01:23:27.964 --> 01:23:30.244
...on the weekend,
hole up, retrench.

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.959
Prove you have a
way to revitalize...

01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:36.209
...this story, and I
might keep you on it.

01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:41.384
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.946
This is the story of...

01:23:48.046 --> 01:23:50.472
...a mystery that
may never be solved.

01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:52.960
The story of a brilliant
young lawyer...

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.351
...who loved this land...

01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:56.666
...and wanted to fight
to preserve it...

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:58.188
...from the inroads of man...

01:23:58.288 --> 01:23:59.940
...until his abrupt death...

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.040
...a few months ago.

01:24:03.377 --> 01:24:05.769
His body was found
in a lonely cottage,

01:24:05.869 --> 01:24:07.948
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:10.242
There was a bullet in his head...

01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:12.342
...and a gun beside him.

01:24:12.845 --> 01:24:16.370
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:18.666
But he died sitting at a computer,

01:24:18.766 --> 01:24:20.335
surrounded by his notes...

01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:22.081
...for what he called...

01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:24.506
...the case he was born to win.

01:24:24.982 --> 01:24:27.157
His friends and family ask...

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:29.163
...would anyone commit suicide...

01:24:29.263 --> 01:24:30.304
...in such a manner...

01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:32.404
...at such a time?

01:24:33.115 --> 01:24:37.015
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.126
Who's there?

01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:31.171
It's Darby.

01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:53.735
I got your message.

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:57.030
If they bugged your phone,

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:59.580
they'd think I'd left the country.

01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:08.433
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:10.779
Not yet.

01:26:10.879 --> 01:26:13.879
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

01:26:15.175 --> 01:26:17.175
I could help you find him.

01:26:20.347 --> 01:26:22.347
How'd you find me?

01:26:23.392 --> 01:26:25.519
I called your editor.

01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:29.229
He told you?

01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:34.526
I told him I was
your sister Mary...

01:26:34.626 --> 01:26:37.776
...from out of town
and couldn't find you.

01:26:39.783 --> 01:26:42.408
How'd you know I
had a sister Mary?

01:26:43.287 --> 01:26:46.212
You're not the only
one doing research.

01:27:12.983 --> 01:27:15.152
It was a beautiful service.

01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:18.113
Thank you, Mr President.

01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:32.558
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:44.471
It was the right thing to do,

01:27:44.571 --> 01:27:47.196
no matter where
the body was found.

01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:56.552
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

01:27:56.652 --> 01:27:58.929
You said they'd be
vetted this weekend.

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:00.931
There must be a change in plans.

01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:03.031
I don't understand.

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.450
The Pelican Brief.

01:28:06.954 --> 01:28:09.129
What about the Pelican Brief?

01:28:09.164 --> 01:28:11.834
I thought that was
ancient history.

01:28:12.084 --> 01:28:15.384
We believe that Grantham's
gotten hold of it.

01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:18.949
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

01:28:19.049 --> 01:28:21.049
Not if it's true.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.640
You think it's true?

01:28:29.226 --> 01:28:31.626
I know what Grantham will write:

01:28:31.979 --> 01:28:34.131
'A man who gave
the president millions...

01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:36.201
...had two Supreme
Court Justices killed...

01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:37.301
...so the president...

01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:40.271
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.870
...so his oil could be harvested.'

01:28:43.115 --> 01:28:45.449
If Voyles says you told
him to back off...

01:28:45.549 --> 01:28:47.770
...the case, we face
an obstruction charge.

01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:49.870
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:54.841
There's a way to handle this.

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:56.918
Handle it how?

01:28:57.671 --> 01:28:59.646
We appoint two nature-lovers...

01:28:59.746 --> 01:29:00.949
...to the court.

01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:02.730
Good environmentalists...

01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:05.412
...who'd kill Mattiece
and his oil field.

01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:07.656
Meet with Voyles,
in the presence...

01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:09.291
...of the Attorney General...

01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.292
...and demand an investigation...

01:29:11.392 --> 01:29:12.169
...into Mattiece.

01:29:12.269 --> 01:29:15.172
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:17.649
Then we ride out the storm.

01:29:18.233 --> 01:29:20.893
But there has to be
some way to keep...

01:29:20.918 --> 01:29:23.097
...this information
from coming out.

01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:25.197
I'm working on it.

01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:28.185
What?
How?

01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:29.978
Mr President...

01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:32.078
...you don't want to know.

01:29:42.591 --> 01:29:44.591
What's this all about?

01:29:44.635 --> 01:29:46.662
A trip to Mt. Vernon
will do you good.

01:29:46.762 --> 01:29:48.762
Are you losing it?

01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:50.984
First I order you to
go to Little Rock,

01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.084
you refuse to go.

01:29:52.184 --> 01:29:55.295
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

01:29:55.395 --> 01:29:57.495
...your boss, I might add...

01:29:57.606 --> 01:29:59.132
...to drop everything...

01:29:59.232 --> 01:30:01.218
...and meet you at George's place.

01:30:01.318 --> 01:30:03.887
I thought of making
you unemployed...

01:30:03.987 --> 01:30:06.181
...but you'd sue me
for discrimination.

01:30:06.281 --> 01:30:08.058
She's here.

01:30:08.158 --> 01:30:10.183
The bird girl?
- She's here.

01:30:11.453 --> 01:30:13.480
You could've told me.
#NAME?

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.502
By the way, refusing to tell me...

01:30:15.602 --> 01:30:17.234
...where you could be reached...

01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:19.236
...didn't leave a good impression.

01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.139
It's too risky to go
to my apartment...

01:30:21.239 --> 01:30:22.239
...or to the job.

01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:24.908
Where have you been?
#NAME?

01:30:25.008 --> 01:30:26.333
This is a hell of a time...

01:30:26.433 --> 01:30:27.911
...to punch notches in your belt.

01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.633
We're not in the same hotel.

01:30:29.733 --> 01:30:31.415
She's helping me find Garcia.

01:30:31.515 --> 01:30:34.017
It sounds like she's in control.

01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:36.086
It's the only way she'd play.

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:38.255
So what if you can't find Garcia?

01:30:38.355 --> 01:30:40.355
We go to plan B.
What's that?

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.150
We attack the lawyers directly.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:43.677
What if it's another firm?

01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:45.262
We go to plan C.
What's that?

01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:47.952
We didn't go that far.
What if you do?

01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:51.031
I must be able to get
in touch with you.

01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:55.043
I'm at the Marbury
Hotel, room 833.

01:30:55.143 --> 01:30:56.899
Don't use my name.

01:30:56.999 --> 01:30:58.999
Write it down.

01:31:00.377 --> 01:31:02.654
You mind getting off
at the next exit?

01:31:02.754 --> 01:31:04.239
Why?

01:31:04.339 --> 01:31:07.189
A tan car's been two
cars behind us...

01:31:07.467 --> 01:31:10.012
...since we got on the parkway.

01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:31.381
I thought it was following us.

01:31:31.408 --> 01:31:33.408
Right.

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:17.660
Georgetown Law School, please.

01:32:24.211 --> 01:32:26.211
Hurry.

01:33:31.945 --> 01:33:33.945
Meet me by the stacks.

01:33:47.794 --> 01:33:49.794
Someone was in my room.

01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:53.784
Did you tell anyone
where you were?

01:33:53.884 --> 01:33:56.659
Smith Keen, but he'd
never repeat it.

01:33:56.803 --> 01:33:58.803
Did you tell him by phone?

01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.805
No.
We were...

01:34:01.642 --> 01:34:03.642
We were in his car.

01:34:03.644 --> 01:34:05.504
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:07.756
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

01:34:07.856 --> 01:34:09.091
This is Susan Johnson.

01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:11.301
I'm a partner with
White & Blazevich.

01:34:11.401 --> 01:34:15.155
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

01:34:15.405 --> 01:34:18.158
May I have the names
of your students...

01:34:18.258 --> 01:34:20.310
...that clerked here last summer?

01:34:20.410 --> 01:34:22.410
I'm from White & Blazevich.

01:34:22.485 --> 01:34:24.485
You have something for me?

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:28.252
Would you sign this, please?

01:34:34.883 --> 01:34:37.808
Thank you, Mr Stevens.
- You're welcome.

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.414
I'll call these five
and see who's home.

01:34:40.514 --> 01:34:43.409
I'll take the two with
no phone number...

01:34:43.509 --> 01:34:45.984
...and get their class schedules.

01:34:50.774 --> 01:34:52.774
See you later.

01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.806
I'm from the Washington Herald.

01:34:59.906 --> 01:35:01.143
I'm looking for...

01:35:01.243 --> 01:35:02.812
...Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.

01:35:02.912 --> 01:35:03.854
Is there a problem?

01:35:03.954 --> 01:35:04.954
No.

01:35:05.054 --> 01:35:06.815
Just a few questions
I want to ask.

01:35:06.915 --> 01:35:09.240
Are they in class this morning?

01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:12.586
One moment, please.

01:35:19.636 --> 01:35:21.413
Excuse me.

01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:23.513
Do you have ID?

01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:28.020
Could I speak to
Dennis Maylor, please?

01:35:29.021 --> 01:35:31.046
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:33.275
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:35:38.614 --> 01:35:40.644
Akers has Criminal Procedure,

01:35:40.714 --> 01:35:42.714
Kaas has Administrative Law.

01:35:42.743 --> 01:35:44.478
I'll try to find them. Maylor,

01:35:44.578 --> 01:35:46.730
Reinhart and Wilson
were all at home.

01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.830
I can go to Maylor's.

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:52.194
Excuse me.

01:35:52.294 --> 01:35:54.027
Do you know Laura Kaas?

01:35:54.127 --> 01:35:56.944
She's the girl with
the red backpack.

01:36:02.513 --> 01:36:04.513
Do you recognize this man?

01:36:04.513 --> 01:36:07.138
He's a lawyer at
White & Blazevich.

01:36:07.476 --> 01:36:09.336
We're down to Akers and Linney.

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:11.380
Linney's phone was disconnected.

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.340
I'll get his class schedule.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.540
I'll keep looking for Akers.

01:36:15.776 --> 01:36:17.776
It's me again.

01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:20.597
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:22.697
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

01:36:22.699 --> 01:36:24.854
A student you talked to called

01:36:24.954 --> 01:36:27.771
White & Blazevich,
who called the Dean.

01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:30.721
No more class schedules
for reporters.

01:36:41.969 --> 01:36:43.969
Mr Grantham.

01:36:44.805 --> 01:36:46.805
I know Edward.

01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:49.765
He's dropped out of
school for a while.

01:36:49.865 --> 01:36:51.587
Personal problems.

01:36:51.687 --> 01:36:53.046
Where is he?

01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:56.221
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

01:36:56.567 --> 01:36:58.610
He's being detoxified.

01:37:00.696 --> 01:37:02.990
Look, he's a good guy.

01:37:04.658 --> 01:37:06.658
Parklane Hospital.

01:37:31.268 --> 01:37:33.268
Good afternoon.

01:37:34.188 --> 01:37:36.188
May I see Edward Linney?

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.842
What room is he in?
- What's your name?

01:37:38.942 --> 01:37:41.778
Gray Grantham,
Washington Herald.

01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:45.062
The law school said
I could see him.

01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:47.807
I'm sorry they did.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.737
We run this hospital...

01:37:49.837 --> 01:37:52.312
...and they run their law school.

01:37:52.664 --> 01:37:54.839
May I see your administrator?

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:57.734
I'll see if I can find him.

01:38:22.986 --> 01:38:24.555
Mr Grantham.

01:38:24.655 --> 01:38:26.655
Great architecture.

01:38:26.907 --> 01:38:28.907
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

01:38:29.076 --> 01:38:30.435
Visitation...

01:38:30.535 --> 01:38:32.146
...is only allowed
on the weekend...

01:38:32.246 --> 01:38:34.246
...and then only family.

01:38:34.498 --> 01:38:36.625
When will he be discharged?

01:38:37.934 --> 01:38:40.259
I'm afraid that's confidential.

01:38:40.838 --> 01:38:43.463
Perhaps when his
insurance expires?

01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:47.634
Do you recognize that man?

01:38:49.346 --> 01:38:51.346
What's his name?

01:38:51.932 --> 01:38:54.268
That's the point,
I don't know.

01:38:55.853 --> 01:38:57.853
What is his name?

01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:04.086
He works in the oil
and gas section...

01:39:04.186 --> 01:39:06.186
...on the 9th floor.

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:11.950
Morgan.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:15.620
Yes. Morgan.

01:39:16.248 --> 01:39:18.066
His first name's something like...

01:39:18.166 --> 01:39:20.502
...Charles, but that's not it.

01:39:21.545 --> 01:39:24.170
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

01:39:26.842 --> 01:39:28.867
When you opened the door...

01:39:30.345 --> 01:39:32.820
...I thought I was hallucinating.

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:36.057
I'm sorry.

01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:39.827
I'll take a hallucination
like that...

01:39:40.063 --> 01:39:42.063
...anytime.

01:39:44.318 --> 01:39:46.318
Take care of yourself.

01:39:51.632 --> 01:39:54.332
Excuse me, miss.
What are you doing?

01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:55.813
Visiting my brother.

01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:57.481
Who is your brother?

01:39:57.581 --> 01:39:59.581
Edward Linney.

01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:02.501
This your sister?

01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:09.785
Yes.

01:40:09.885 --> 01:40:11.885
Leave her alone.

01:40:12.804 --> 01:40:14.979
Mom will come on the weekend.

01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:17.307
Sis?

01:40:17.309 --> 01:40:18.836
Come back soon.

01:40:18.936 --> 01:40:20.936
I'll try.

01:40:21.271 --> 01:40:23.319
I know you'd agree
with me about...

01:40:23.419 --> 01:40:25.467
...the horrendous
cost of health care.

01:40:25.567 --> 01:40:27.261
Of course, of course.

01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.100
We pride ourselves on our...

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.515
...enlightened policy
regarding payment.

01:40:31.615 --> 01:40:34.165
Thank you very much for your time.

01:40:36.787 --> 01:40:39.176
We'll be happy to have you back...

01:40:39.276 --> 01:40:42.126
...on any of our
normal visiting days.

01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:47.840
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

01:40:58.934 --> 01:41:00.669
White & Blazevich, please.

01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:03.094
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

01:41:24.668 --> 01:41:25.778
May I help you?

01:41:25.878 --> 01:41:28.653
Dorothy Blythe, to
see Curtis Morgan.

01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:33.257
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

01:42:07.711 --> 01:42:10.091
You have a meeting with Mr Morgan?

01:42:10.161 --> 01:42:11.448
Yes. At 5.

01:42:11.548 --> 01:42:13.169
When was your appointment?

01:42:13.269 --> 01:42:14.118
Two weeks ago.

01:42:14.218 --> 01:42:15.994
May I ask why?

01:42:16.094 --> 01:42:19.094
Obviously, I need an
oil and gas lawyer.

01:42:20.057 --> 01:42:22.057
Curtis Morgan is dead.

01:42:24.186 --> 01:42:26.186
Why didn't anyone call me?

01:42:26.188 --> 01:42:29.038
We have no record of
your appointment.

01:42:29.733 --> 01:42:31.343
What happened?

01:42:31.443 --> 01:42:33.737
He was mugged a week ago.

01:42:33.946 --> 01:42:36.306
Shot by street punks, we believe.

01:42:36.406 --> 01:42:38.806
Do you have some identification?

01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:40.811
He's Security.

01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:42.911
Security for what?

01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:44.341
Come with us,

01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:46.316
you should see someone else.

01:42:46.416 --> 01:42:49.465
After this treatment,
I have no interest...

01:42:49.565 --> 01:42:52.340
...in talking to
anyone in this firm.

01:43:07.938 --> 01:43:09.940
They killed him.

01:43:18.031 --> 01:43:20.031
I can't breathe.

01:43:35.966 --> 01:43:38.468
It's all right.
Just let it go.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760
Let it go.

01:43:44.892 --> 01:43:46.892
It's all right.

01:43:53.984 --> 01:43:55.862
We ran the story about a week ago.

01:43:55.962 --> 01:43:57.387
It's just another mugging.

01:43:57.487 --> 01:43:59.962
Didn't make the Metro front page.

01:44:00.199 --> 01:44:01.725
Curtis Morgan...

01:44:01.825 --> 01:44:04.328
...225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

01:44:04.912 --> 01:44:07.289
225 Willow Road...

01:44:07.831 --> 01:44:09.831
...Bethesda.

01:44:09.833 --> 01:44:11.443
That's what I wanted.

01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:13.818
Report in before noon tomorrow.

01:44:13.918 --> 01:44:15.918
We're nervous over here.

01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:17.574
You know...

01:44:17.674 --> 01:44:19.849
...good help is hard to find.

01:44:26.725 --> 01:44:28.725
I'm going with you.

01:44:32.814 --> 01:44:34.814
Look at me.

01:44:43.033 --> 01:44:45.033
I want you to leave.

01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:50.041
And if you need confirmation...

01:44:50.094 --> 01:44:51.442
...for your story?

01:44:51.542 --> 01:44:53.542
I'm on my own.

01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:58.715
What's changed your mind?

01:45:02.553 --> 01:45:04.721
I want you to reach 25.

01:45:11.353 --> 01:45:13.353
I'm coming.

01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:42.826
Good evening.

01:45:42.926 --> 01:45:45.579
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:47.494
Could we see Mrs Morgan?

01:45:47.594 --> 01:45:49.954
I'm her father.
She won't talk.

01:45:50.601 --> 01:45:52.158
I respect her privacy.

01:45:52.258 --> 01:45:54.838
I know she's been
through an ordeal.

01:45:54.938 --> 01:45:56.443
When did you people...

01:45:56.543 --> 01:45:58.884
...ever respect anyone's privacy?

01:45:58.984 --> 01:46:01.709
I feel that way
about most reporters.

01:46:01.809 --> 01:46:03.909
But her husband called me...

01:46:04.031 --> 01:46:06.031
...3 times before he died.

01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:09.225
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

01:46:10.621 --> 01:46:14.371
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

01:46:16.627 --> 01:46:18.627
You change your mind...

01:46:19.046 --> 01:46:21.046
...I'll be at this number.

01:47:29.241 --> 01:47:32.494
Mr Grantham?
Yes.

01:47:33.203 --> 01:47:35.203
This is Mrs Morgan.

01:47:36.707 --> 01:47:39.209
Do you still want to see me?

01:47:42.045 --> 01:47:44.745
Did you know your
husband called me?

01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.551
No. How would he know...

01:47:49.651 --> 01:47:51.789
...anything about
those dead judges?

01:47:51.889 --> 01:47:54.016
I have no idea.

01:47:55.058 --> 01:47:57.058
Did he keep any...

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:59.104
...unusual documents...

01:47:59.396 --> 01:48:01.396
...or papers?

01:48:02.065 --> 01:48:04.375
We have a lock box at the bank...

01:48:04.447 --> 01:48:06.447
...for deed and wills.

01:48:06.904 --> 01:48:09.029
I looked at it last Thursday.

01:48:09.129 --> 01:48:11.529
There was nothing unusual in it.

01:48:12.743 --> 01:48:14.743
On Saturday morning...

01:48:14.786 --> 01:48:16.961
...I was going through his...

01:48:18.749 --> 01:48:20.834
...desk in the bedroom.

01:48:22.044 --> 01:48:24.444
I found something a bit unusual.

01:48:26.423 --> 01:48:28.423
A key.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.760
A key to what?

01:48:32.763 --> 01:48:34.763
Another lock box.

01:48:36.433 --> 01:48:38.433
Which bank?

01:48:39.102 --> 01:48:41.102
Riggs Bank.

01:48:44.441 --> 01:48:46.441
We've never banked there.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.785
And you knew nothing
about this other...

01:48:49.988 --> 01:48:51.140
...box?

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.265
Not until Saturday morning.

01:48:53.575 --> 01:48:55.575
I figured...

01:48:56.119 --> 01:48:58.819
...I'll run by when
I felt up to it.

01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:02.640
Maybe you should
check it, Mrs Morgan.

01:49:04.461 --> 01:49:07.011
Could be a clue to who killed him.

01:49:07.965 --> 01:49:10.592
Are you saying
Curtis was killed...

01:49:10.801 --> 01:49:12.542
...because he knew something...

01:49:12.642 --> 01:49:14.037
...about the a ssassinations?

01:49:14.137 --> 01:49:16.462
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:18.908
Do you think there...

01:49:19.008 --> 01:49:22.233
...may be papers in
the safe-deposit box...

01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:24.718
...that may reveal
what Curtis knew...

01:49:24.818 --> 01:49:26.383
...about the a ssassinations?

01:49:26.483 --> 01:49:28.483
There could be.

01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:33.323
My child's lost one parent.

01:49:37.494 --> 01:49:39.669
I can't let her lose another.

01:49:41.999 --> 01:49:43.999
I'll check it for you.

01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:46.951
No one has to know
you have the key.

01:49:50.924 --> 01:49:53.549
They will only give
it to his wife.

01:49:53.635 --> 01:49:56.560
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

01:49:57.848 --> 01:49:59.583
I would have one condition.

01:49:59.683 --> 01:50:02.273
If you find something
that disparages...

01:50:02.373 --> 01:50:04.963
...my husband in any
way, you can't use it.

01:50:05.063 --> 01:50:07.441
You have my word, Mrs Morgan.

01:51:42.452 --> 01:51:44.354
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

01:51:44.454 --> 01:51:46.454
Down those steps.

01:53:07.204 --> 01:53:09.374
I need access to a box, please.

01:53:09.456 --> 01:53:11.542
The number, please?
- 616

01:53:14.586 --> 01:53:17.490
This box was rented two weeks ago.

01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:18.782
Yes.

01:53:18.882 --> 01:53:20.882
I assume you're Mrs Morgan?

01:53:20.886 --> 01:53:21.994
Sara Ann Morgan.

01:53:22.094 --> 01:53:23.094
The address?

01:53:23.194 --> 01:53:25.194
225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

01:53:26.223 --> 01:53:29.768
Phone number?
- 7984

01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:32.171
Who rented this box?

01:53:32.271 --> 01:53:34.469
My husband,
Curtis D. Morgan.

01:53:34.569 --> 01:53:36.921
And his social security number?

01:53:40.737 --> 01:53:43.156
510-96-8686.

01:53:44.867 --> 01:53:46.892
Will you sign here, please?

01:53:47.286 --> 01:53:48.479
May I help you?

01:53:48.579 --> 01:53:50.579
I'd like to rent a box.

01:53:50.747 --> 01:53:54.497
Will you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:53:55.627 --> 01:53:56.820
You have a key?

01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.920
Yes, I do.

01:54:00.424 --> 01:54:02.424
Follow me.

01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:45.035
It's a four-page affidavit...

01:55:45.112 --> 01:55:47.698
...signed under oath.

01:55:47.906 --> 01:55:51.806
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

01:55:53.871 --> 01:55:56.193
He worked at White & Blazevich...

01:55:56.293 --> 01:55:59.443
...in the oil and gas
section for 5 years.

01:56:00.002 --> 01:56:01.278
Listen to this.

01:56:01.378 --> 01:56:02.905
During that time...

01:56:03.005 --> 01:56:05.102
...he worked for a client who...

01:56:05.202 --> 01:56:07.701
...was engaged in a
lawsuit in Louisiana.

01:56:07.801 --> 01:56:11.101
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece...

01:56:11.221 --> 01:56:12.956
...who he's never met.

01:56:13.056 --> 01:56:14.567
Lots about the lawsuit,

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:17.187
how desperate Mattiece
was to win it.

01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:19.227
Just as if you wrote it.

01:56:20.731 --> 01:56:23.734
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

01:56:23.942 --> 01:56:26.028
...supervised the case for W & B.

01:56:26.128 --> 01:56:28.472
Morgan worked on a
peripherated case.

01:56:28.572 --> 01:56:30.391
He took files and documents...

01:56:30.491 --> 01:56:32.309
...that Wakefield left for him...

01:56:32.409 --> 01:56:34.144
...not related to the case.

01:56:34.244 --> 01:56:36.614
When he got back to
his own office, he...

01:56:36.714 --> 01:56:39.024
...found a memo on the
bottom of the stack.

01:56:39.124 --> 01:56:42.444
He'd inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk.

01:56:42.544 --> 01:56:45.697
A copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit.

01:56:45.797 --> 01:56:48.457
He copied the memo
and left the memo...

01:56:48.508 --> 01:56:50.369
...under the files on his desk.

01:56:50.469 --> 01:56:52.763
Next stop,
Washington Herald.

01:56:55.432 --> 01:56:57.532
No. Stop.
Get out of the car.

02:00:12.129 --> 02:00:14.212
There was a car explosion...

02:00:14.312 --> 02:00:16.158
...in a garage near
the Riggs Bank.

02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:19.633
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

02:00:20.095 --> 02:00:22.795
It was rented
yesterday by Grantham.

02:00:25.058 --> 02:00:27.233
Have you heard from Grantham?

02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:30.187
Not since yesterday.

02:00:31.982 --> 02:00:34.551
I should've taken
him off that story.

02:00:34.651 --> 02:00:36.651
What story?

02:00:38.989 --> 02:00:40.989
See what you can find.

02:01:02.095 --> 02:01:03.914
Smith Keen...

02:01:04.014 --> 02:01:06.014
...meet Darby Shaw.

02:01:07.768 --> 02:01:09.768
So, Mr Grantham...

02:01:09.811 --> 02:01:11.986
...what the hell is going on?

02:01:21.865 --> 02:01:24.940
Sweetheart, I'm down here
in the basement.

02:01:26.453 --> 02:01:28.703
It's about two in the morning.

02:01:31.208 --> 02:01:33.208
This is...

02:01:33.335 --> 02:01:35.335
...an affidavit...

02:01:37.047 --> 02:01:39.972
...concerning a memo
I found on my desk.

02:01:41.176 --> 02:01:45.013
I'm going to trust you
to do with it what you will.

02:01:46.056 --> 02:01:49.506
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:55.399
It was dated September 28th...

02:01:56.733 --> 02:01:59.583
...addressed to
Wakefield and it read:

02:01:59.736 --> 02:02:02.811
'Sims, advise client
research is complete.

02:02:03.073 --> 02:02:05.383
The bench will sit much softer...

02:02:05.472 --> 02:02:07.647
...if the old man is retired.

02:02:07.744 --> 02:02:10.510
The second retirement
is a bit unusual.

02:02:10.610 --> 02:02:12.149
Jensen, of all people.

02:02:12.249 --> 02:02:14.081
Advise further that the pelican...

02:02:14.181 --> 02:02:15.903
...should arrive
here in 4 years...

02:02:16.003 --> 02:02:18.088
...assuming other factors.'

02:02:19.047 --> 02:02:21.047
There's no signature.

02:02:21.508 --> 02:02:23.858
Then Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

02:02:23.958 --> 02:02:25.958
...were killed.

02:02:27.389 --> 02:02:29.000
I firmly believe that this is...

02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.126
...the work of Mattiece
and his associates.

02:02:31.226 --> 02:02:32.754
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,

02:02:32.854 --> 02:02:34.171
but it refers to a client.

02:02:34.271 --> 02:02:36.596
Wakefield had no other clients.

02:02:36.815 --> 02:02:39.318
And no client had
as much to gain...

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:41.418
...from the new court.

02:02:41.778 --> 02:02:44.379
I thought that I
was protecting us...

02:02:44.479 --> 02:02:46.954
...by not revealing what I found.

02:02:47.284 --> 02:02:49.709
You'll only see this if I'm gone,

02:02:49.809 --> 02:02:51.809
so I will have failed.

02:02:52.789 --> 02:02:54.789
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

02:02:59.254 --> 02:03:01.254
I'll always be with you.

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:05.342
Always.

02:03:07.638 --> 02:03:10.431
This is Marty Velmano.
What a pleasure.

02:03:10.531 --> 02:03:12.084
What can I do for you?

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:15.409
We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece...

02:03:15.979 --> 02:03:18.715
...and his involvement
in the deaths...

02:03:18.815 --> 02:03:20.509
...of Rosenberg and Jensen.

02:03:20.609 --> 02:03:22.980
Great. We'll sue you
for the next 20...

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.389
...years. You'll be
named as a defendant.

02:03:25.489 --> 02:03:27.574
Oh, this will be great.

02:03:27.824 --> 02:03:30.524
Victor Mattiece will
own the Herald.

02:03:30.577 --> 02:03:33.227
Have you heard of
the Pelican Brief?

02:03:33.327 --> 02:03:35.065
We have a copy of it.

02:03:35.165 --> 02:03:37.151
We also have a copy of a memo...

02:03:37.251 --> 02:03:39.236
...sent by you to
Sims Wakefield...

02:03:39.336 --> 02:03:41.725
...in which you suggest
your client's...

02:03:41.825 --> 02:03:44.032
...position would be
greatly improved...

02:03:44.132 --> 02:03:46.442
...by the removal of Rosenberg...

02:03:46.531 --> 02:03:48.579
...and Jensen from the court.

02:03:48.679 --> 02:03:51.014
I noticed you waited till five.

02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:53.126
An hour earlier,
we could've...

02:03:53.226 --> 02:03:54.877
...run to court,
stopped this.

02:03:54.977 --> 02:03:57.077
You deny you wrote the memo?

02:04:00.315 --> 02:04:02.317
It's a fabrication.

02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:05.510
You have no lawsuit,
Mr Velmano.

02:04:06.196 --> 02:04:07.806
You know it.

02:04:07.906 --> 02:04:09.906
You son of a bitch.

02:04:12.703 --> 02:04:14.396
Mr Coal?

02:04:14.496 --> 02:04:16.524
Have you read the Pelican Brief?

02:04:16.624 --> 02:04:17.816
I have.

02:04:17.916 --> 02:04:20.264
We're running a story
which verifies...

02:04:20.364 --> 02:04:22.404
...the facts set
forth in that brief.

02:04:22.504 --> 02:04:24.027
We've confirmed Mattiece...

02:04:24.127 --> 02:04:25.824
...contributed over $4 million...

02:04:25.924 --> 02:04:28.077
...to the president's
last campaign.

02:04:28.177 --> 02:04:30.621
4,200,000, all through
legal channels.

02:04:30.721 --> 02:04:31.872
That's right.

02:04:31.972 --> 02:04:34.114
We believe the
White House tried...

02:04:34.214 --> 02:04:36.418
...to obstruct the
FBI investigation...

02:04:36.518 --> 02:04:39.296
...and we wonder
if there are any comments.

02:04:39.396 --> 02:04:40.735
The White House denies...

02:04:40.835 --> 02:04:42.841
...any direct or
indirect involvement...

02:04:42.941 --> 02:04:45.194
...in this investigation.

02:04:45.903 --> 02:04:48.678
You've received some
bad information.

02:04:56.163 --> 02:04:58.290
Mr Voyles, it's Grantham.

02:04:59.708 --> 02:05:02.569
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:05.114
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

02:05:05.214 --> 02:05:07.208
We're naming Mattiece, an oil...

02:05:07.308 --> 02:05:09.493
...speculator, and
two of his lawyers.

02:05:09.593 --> 02:05:12.024
We believe the FBI
knew about Mattiece,

02:05:12.124 --> 02:05:13.664
but didn't investigate...

02:05:13.764 --> 02:05:16.339
...at the urging of
the White House.

02:05:16.439 --> 02:05:18.439
Any comments?

02:06:29.464 --> 02:06:32.743
I think we'll have great
success with these people.

02:06:32.843 --> 02:06:35.512
They were really very pleased...

02:06:35.846 --> 02:06:38.182
...and genuinely cooperative.

02:06:38.765 --> 02:06:40.765
What's up?

02:07:24.102 --> 02:07:26.102
You know Gray Grantham.

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.606
And this is Darby Shaw.

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.616
So you're the little lady...

02:07:39.661 --> 02:07:42.286
...who started this
great brouhaha.

02:07:42.371 --> 02:07:44.541
I think you have me confused...

02:07:44.628 --> 02:07:46.798
...with the president's friend.

02:07:46.834 --> 02:07:50.420
I have some comments,
for the record.

02:07:59.388 --> 02:08:01.312
First, we got the Pelican Brief...

02:08:01.412 --> 02:08:02.291
...two weeks ago...

02:08:02.391 --> 02:08:04.277
...and submitted it
to the White House...

02:08:04.377 --> 02:08:05.377
...on the same day.

02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:08.036
It was not considered
high priority in...

02:08:08.136 --> 02:08:10.632
...the investigation
until Gavin Verheek...

02:08:10.732 --> 02:08:12.726
...Special Counsel
to the Director,

02:08:12.826 --> 02:08:13.886
was found murdered.

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:16.036
Did the White House interfere...

02:08:16.136 --> 02:08:18.515
...in the FBI
investigation of Mattiece?

02:08:18.615 --> 02:08:20.615
I'll discuss it...

02:08:20.617 --> 02:08:22.617
...off the record.

02:08:29.793 --> 02:08:32.205
Last Wednesday the
president asked me...

02:08:32.305 --> 02:08:34.656
...to ignore Victor
Mattiece as a suspect.

02:08:34.756 --> 02:08:36.756
In his words...

02:08:36.925 --> 02:08:39.100
...he asked me to 'back off.'

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.678
I have a tape...

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:44.340
...which I will allow
no one to hear...

02:08:44.391 --> 02:08:47.466
...unless the president
first denies this.

02:08:48.145 --> 02:08:50.145
So what do you do now?

02:08:50.898 --> 02:08:52.998
There'll be a grand jury by...

02:08:53.091 --> 02:08:55.791
...noon tomorrow.
Quick indictments.

02:08:56.278 --> 02:08:58.447
And we'll find Mattiece.

02:09:00.824 --> 02:09:03.899
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms Shaw.

02:09:04.494 --> 02:09:06.396
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

02:09:06.496 --> 02:09:08.671
I'd like Mr Grantham to stay.

02:09:29.186 --> 02:09:31.186
What's next for you?

02:09:31.813 --> 02:09:34.425
Who killed the man
disguised as Verheek?

02:09:34.525 --> 02:09:37.319
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

02:09:38.195 --> 02:09:40.000
Off the record,
Khamel was killed...

02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:41.390
...by a contract operative...

02:09:41.490 --> 02:09:44.040
...hired independently by the CIA.

02:09:44.535 --> 02:09:45.769
Rupert?

02:09:45.869 --> 02:09:47.646
He probably has 20 names.

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:49.746
Why was he following her?

02:09:50.207 --> 02:09:52.036
I think the brief initially...

02:09:52.136 --> 02:09:54.153
...scared Giminski
more than anyone.

02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:55.946
And he probably...

02:09:56.046 --> 02:09:57.197
...sent Rupert...

02:09:57.297 --> 02:09:59.297
...to trail Darby...

02:09:59.508 --> 02:10:02.733
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

02:10:05.764 --> 02:10:09.226
We can help.
What do you want?

02:10:11.687 --> 02:10:13.787
To leave the country, alone.

02:10:16.733 --> 02:10:18.302
All right.

02:10:18.402 --> 02:10:21.513
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.250
We'll fly you anywhere you want...

02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:24.391
...and you can disappear.

02:10:24.491 --> 02:10:27.416
But you must allow
me to contact you...

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.104
...through Mr Grantham...

02:10:29.204 --> 02:10:30.579
...if, and only if,

02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:32.929
it becomes urgently necessary.

02:10:34.918 --> 02:10:36.918
That's fine.

02:10:38.922 --> 02:10:41.422
I want no one on the plane but me,

02:10:41.522 --> 02:10:43.410
Gray and the pilots.

02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:45.522
After take-off, I'll
tell the pilot...

02:10:45.622 --> 02:10:46.622
...where to go.

02:10:46.722 --> 02:10:50.322
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:53.061
You're the director of the FBI.

02:10:54.104 --> 02:10:56.104
Set it up.

02:14:51.466 --> 02:14:53.660
Our guest today is
Gray Grantham...

02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:55.821
...who has, as just
about everyone...

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:56.955
...in America knows...

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:59.435
...revealed the plot behind the...

02:14:59.487 --> 02:15:02.169
...assassinations of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

02:15:02.269 --> 02:15:04.486
The ripple effects
of this story...

02:15:04.586 --> 02:15:06.090
...just don't seem to stop.

02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:08.346
As of this broadcast,
Victor Mattiece,

02:15:08.446 --> 02:15:10.427
one of the country's
richest men...

02:15:10.527 --> 02:15:12.907
...has been indicted,
along with...

02:15:12.982 --> 02:15:14.306
...4 aides and lawyers.

02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:17.066
Fletcher Coal, the
president's Chief...

02:15:17.148 --> 02:15:18.685
...of Staff, has resigned.

02:15:18.785 --> 02:15:20.855
And we're getting
strong indications...

02:15:20.955 --> 02:15:22.481
...that the president himself...

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.581
...will not run again.

02:15:24.708 --> 02:15:28.233
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

02:15:28.921 --> 02:15:31.388
We know the Pelican
Brief was written...

02:15:31.488 --> 02:15:33.325
...by a woman named Darby Shaw...

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:35.900
...but we don't know who that is.

02:15:35.928 --> 02:15:37.930
Who is Darby Shaw?

02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:43.018
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

02:15:43.227 --> 02:15:44.423
Next question.

02:15:44.523 --> 02:15:47.856
Speaking for many of
our colleagues...

02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:50.150
...who are in a
feeding frenzy to...

02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:51.093
...interview her...

02:15:51.193 --> 02:15:53.193
...where is Darby Shaw?

02:15:53.237 --> 02:15:55.876
That's also a question
for Darby Shaw.

02:15:55.976 --> 02:15:57.766
But she's not available...

02:15:57.866 --> 02:15:59.280
...to answer questions...

02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:01.145
...until the feeding frenzy stops.

02:16:01.245 --> 02:16:02.385
Does that mean...

02:16:02.485 --> 02:16:04.810
...you don't know where she is?

02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:06.734
I didn't say that.

02:16:06.834 --> 02:16:08.834
Then you do know.

02:16:12.339 --> 02:16:14.742
I take it this
cryptic smile means...

02:16:14.842 --> 02:16:16.842
...you're not answering.

02:16:18.762 --> 02:16:22.057
In view of all this,
you know that...

02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:24.376
...there's speculation...

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:26.856
...that this woman is a figment...

02:16:26.934 --> 02:16:28.297
...of your imagination.

02:16:28.397 --> 02:16:29.978
That you created her...

02:16:30.078 --> 02:16:32.702
...from a lot of
different sources.

02:16:33.067 --> 02:16:35.054
Just as there are
people who believe...

02:16:35.154 --> 02:16:36.513
...there was no Deep Throat...

02:16:36.612 --> 02:16:38.568
...there are those who believe...

02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:40.017
...there is no Darby Shaw.

02:16:40.117 --> 02:16:41.209
In other words,

02:16:41.308 --> 02:16:43.634
she's just too good to be true.

02:16:44.871 --> 02:16:46.871
She almost is.
