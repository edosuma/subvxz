male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.736 --> 00:06.307
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.609
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.642 --> 00:10.411
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.444 --> 00:12.046
ARE MEMBERS OF
AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.080 --> 00:14.182
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.350
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:20.654 --> 00:24.658
- [breathing heavily]

00:37.805 --> 00:41.309
- YOU GET YOUR CONFESSION?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.844
- NINE HOURS.
GUY HELD OUT FOR NINE HOURS.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.547
- WELL, THE DESK SERGEANT
ASKED ME TO BRING THIS UP.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.282
YOU WANT A CUP OF COFFEE?

00:48.316 --> 00:50.551
- YEAH, AND TWO EGGS
OVER EASY,

00:50.584 --> 00:52.386
SOME HASHBROWNS,
AND TOAST.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.156
COFFEE'S FINE.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.271
- MATLOCK,
JUDGMENT DAY.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.176
[applause]

01:15.209 --> 01:19.780
DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP,
SON.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.283
- WELCOME BACK, MR. PENA.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.651
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
REPRESENTING YOURSELF.

01:23.684 --> 01:24.652
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.554
- MOTION TO VACATE CONVICTION

01:26.587 --> 01:28.589
BASED ON NEW EVIDENCE.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.124
WHAT NEW EVIDENCE?

01:30.158 --> 01:32.293
- THE EVIDENCE
WOULD BE PENDING A RETESTING

01:32.326 --> 01:33.461
OF THE DNA
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.728
- THERE WAS NO DNA
FOUND AT THE SCENE.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.897
- NONE FOUND
BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGY

01:36.930 --> 01:38.599
AT THE TIME,
BUT WITH NEW TECHNIQUES,

01:38.632 --> 01:41.302
DNA CAN BE RECOVERED
FROM MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS

01:41.335 --> 01:42.736
OF TRACE EVIDENCE.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.173
- YOU'RE ASKING THE COURT
TO OVERTURN YOUR CONVICTION

01:45.206 --> 01:46.174
BASED ON EVIDENCE
YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.342
- THE STATE HAS THE MEANS
AT THEIR DISPOSAL

01:48.376 --> 01:49.610
TO PROVE THAT
I'M NOT THE MAN

01:49.643 --> 01:51.379
WHO COMMITTED
THIS HORRIBLE CRIME.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.347
- BY THAT YOU MEAN THE CRIME
YOU CONFESSED TO?

01:53.381 --> 01:56.850
THE RAPE AND TORTURE
OF ARIEL BASKINS.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.320
YOU TIED HER UP,
STABBED HER,

01:59.353 --> 02:01.255
AND TRIED TO BLIND HER
WITH AMMONIA.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.692
- AS I HAVE MAINTAINED
FOR EIGHT YEARS,

02:04.725 --> 02:09.530
THAT CONFESSION WAS ELICITED
UNDER EXTREME DURESS.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.400
YOUR HONOR, I RECANTED IT
AS SOON AS--

02:12.433 --> 02:13.434
- AFTER PLEADING GUILTY.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.604
AFTER THE VICTIM
I.D.'D YOU.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.440
YOU HAVE FAILED TO MEET
THE STANDARD

02:19.473 --> 02:20.674
TO OVERTURN YOUR CONVICTION.

02:20.708 --> 02:24.845
THE MOTION IS DENIED.
[gavel bangs]

02:24.878 --> 02:27.348
[indistinct chatter]

02:27.381 --> 02:30.418
- [giggling]
I'M SORRY.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.385
MMM.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.687
OH, WE'RE GOING DANCING.
YOU WANT TO COME?

02:33.721 --> 02:34.922
- I THINK I'LL PASS.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.524
- OH, COME ON.
YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE THERE.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.227
- NO, I'M FINE.
- [groans] FINE.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.263
CALL ME TOMORROW.
NOT TOO EARLY!

02:47.868 --> 02:50.604
- [screams]

02:50.638 --> 02:56.644
[sobbing]

03:16.797 --> 03:18.666
- DAVID.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.434
UH, SORRY TO SNEAK OUT
ON YOU LIKE THAT.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.935
I-I WOULD'VE WOKEN YOU,

03:21.969 --> 03:27.241
BUT THEN I PROBABLY NEVER
WOULD HAVE LEFT.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.311
- THE VICTIM
IS GINA LOGAN, 23.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.913
UNIS RESPONDED
TO HER 911 CALL,

03:32.946 --> 03:34.382
FOUND HER TIED TO THE BED.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.584
NOW SHE TOLD THEM THE ATTACKER
FORCED HER INSIDE

03:36.617 --> 03:39.019
AND WORE A SAILOR'S UNIFORM.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.722
- RIGHT, IT'S PAN AMERICAN
FLEET WEEK.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.990
ALL THOSE NAVY BOYS IN TOWN.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.558
- EMS TOOK HER OVER TO MERCY.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.428
SHE'S OUT OF ICU BUT STILL
IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.663
THEY SAID
HE POURED AMMONIA

03:49.697 --> 03:53.367
IN HER EYES,
TRYING TO BLIND HER.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.935
NEIGHBORS DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.438
- WAS SHE GAGGED?
- YEAH.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.407
- HOLD ON.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.642
DID HE CUT HER
BELOW THE CHEST?

04:01.675 --> 04:04.378
- YEAH, THREE SLASHES.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.679
- SON OF A BITCH.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.515
- WHAT, YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.483
- YEAH.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.320
WE PUT HIM AWAY FOR LIFE
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.492
BUT THIS IS HIM.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.331
[dramatic music]

04:23.364 --> 04:31.372
*

05:06.674 --> 05:07.941
- ARE YOU SURE?
OMAR PENA?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.543
- I SPOKE TO THE WARDEN MYSELF.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.379
PENA WAS IN HIS CELL
AT GREEN HAVEN

05:11.412 --> 05:12.446
AS OF TEN MINUTES AGO.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.382
- THIS IS HIS EXACT M.O.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.784
THE NAVY UNIFORM,
FLEET WEEK,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.619
THE TORTURE,
THE AMMONIA.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.888
IF YOU TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY
TOOK HIS PLACE IN PRISON,

05:20.921 --> 05:21.889
I WOULD BELIEVE IT.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.691
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S POSSIBLE.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.460
I MEAN, PENA HAD A HEARING
IN THE CITY A WEEK AGO

05:26.494 --> 05:27.761
TO GET HIS CONVICTION
OVERTURNED.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.130
HE LOST, BUT MAYBE
HE STAGED A FLIP.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.565
- OKAY, LET'S JUST BACK UP.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.800
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.802
- YEAH.
- HOW'S THE VICTIM?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.704
- GINA LOGAN.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.740
CHEMICAL BURNS TO THE EYES
AND THROAT, SLASH WOUNDS.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.908
HE DID A NUMBER ON HER.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.843
- ANY LEADS?
- NO, NOT YET.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.678
NO WITNESSES. CSU IS STILL
CHECKING FOR PRINTS,

05:44.712 --> 05:46.046
RUNNING THE RAPE KIT.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.816
- BUT YOU THINK
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.451
- WE PUT OMAR PENA AWAY
IN 2004.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.785
HE CONFESSED.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.722
THE VICTIM, ARIEL BASKINS,
I.D.'D HIM.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.023
HE SPENT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS
RECANTING.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.625
- DID HE HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE?

05:57.658 --> 05:58.959
- NO, I REMEMBER THIS ONE.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.161
THE VICTIM WAS ALONE WITH HIM
FOR TEN HOURS IN HELL,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.764
GAGGED WITH HER OWN SCARF,

06:03.797 --> 06:04.798
BOUND IN ROPE.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.467
THE GUY NEVER SAID A WORD.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.568
THERE WAS NO PARTNER.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.637
- OKAY,
SO WHAT DID PENA DO?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.805
SWITCH PLACES
WITH A DOPPELGANGER

06:11.839 --> 06:13.807
WHILE HE WAS BEING TRANSFERRED
AFTER THE HEARING?

06:13.841 --> 06:16.644
- MAYBE HE GOT SOMEBODY
ON THE OUTSIDE TO MIMIC HIS M.O.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.580
- A COPYCAT. THROW SUSPICION
ON HIS CONVICTION.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.015
- EITHER WAY, YOU TWO
HEAD UP TO GREEN HAVEN,

06:22.049 --> 06:23.551
TALK TO WHOEVER'S
IN PENA'S CELL.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.585
FIN, ROLLINS,
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.722
SEE IF THE DOCTORS
WILL LET YOU INTERVIEW GINA.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.828
- GINA,
I'M DETECTIVE ROLLINS.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.697
CAN YOU TALK, HONEY?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.432
- [whimpering]
A LITTLE.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.633
- OKAY.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.436
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.439
THAT MAN THAT ATTACKED YOU--
HAD YOU SEEN HIM BEFORE?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.442
- NO.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.512
- WAS HE WHITE?

06:51.545 --> 06:56.950
- HISPANIC.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.988
IN A WHITE NAVY UNIFORM.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.592
- DID HE HAVE AN ACCENT?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.860
- HE NEVER SPOKE.

07:06.894 --> 07:13.133
- DETECTIVE, THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU
TO COME BACK TOMORROW.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.836
- COURTNEY, WHERE WAS THIS BAR
YOU TWO WERE HANGING OUT IN?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.706
- A DIVE. I ALWAYS GO THERE
WHEN THE SHIPS ARE IN.

07:18.739 --> 07:19.840
TALKED GINA
INTO COMING WITH ME.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.910
- HEY, DID ANY HISPANIC SAILORS
TALK TO THE TWO OF YOU?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.046
- IT'S PAN AM FLEET WEEK.
IT WAS LIKE THE U.N. IN THERE.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.682
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU SAW GINA?

07:28.716 --> 07:32.019
- OUTSIDE THE BAR
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.621
I'D HOOKED UP
WITH THIS OFFICER.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.523
WE WERE HEADED TO A CLUB.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.758
GINA FELT LIKE THE THIRD WHEEL,
SO SHE WALKED HOME.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.761
- MM.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.230
- SHE WAS DRUNK.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.232
NEVER SHOULD'VE
LEFT HER ALONE.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.802
- MY ROPE GUY FROM CSU
HAS GOT SOMETHING.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.972
- YOU GOT A ROPE GUY?
- YEAH.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.942
GUESS I'VE BEEN ON THIS JOB
TOO LONG.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.946
- THE ROPE
YOUR RAPIST USED

07:58.979 --> 08:01.749
IS A TRIPLE-BRAIDED
NYLON POLYESTER.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.817
- SORRY, BUT THAT DOESN'T
NARROW IT DOWN MUCH.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.853
- I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN THE KNOT.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.688
NOW FOR A BINDING VICTIM,

08:07.721 --> 08:08.889
WE USUALLY FIND
A SIMPLE OVERHAND KNOT.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.659
THIS GUY USED A CLOVE HITCH
ON THE WRIST

08:11.692 --> 08:13.894
AND BOWLINE TO TIE
TO THE BED.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.696
- OKAY, WELL,
HE WORE A NAVY UNIFORM.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.964
THESE ARE SAILOR'S KNOTS,
RIGHT?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.632
- WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING THEY TEACH

08:18.666 --> 08:19.900
IN NAVY TRAINING.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.970
THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.739
YOU SEE HOW I WRAP
THE WORKING END AROUND

08:25.773 --> 08:28.842
AND FINISH ON THE INSIDE?

08:28.876 --> 08:33.113
NOW WHOEVER TIED THESE
FINISHED ON THE OUTSIDE.

08:33.146 --> 08:37.985
IT MEANS HE'S LEFT-HANDED.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.554
- I'M IN PRISON
TWO HOURS AWAY,

08:40.588 --> 08:43.223
AND YOU THINK I SOMEHOW
RAPED SOMEONE AGAIN?

08:43.256 --> 08:46.994
YOU HER NEW PARTNER?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.962
SHE'S HAD A HARD-ON FOR ME
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.798
- WATCH IT, OMAR.
- WHAT, ME?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.700
SHE PUT ME AWAY FOR A CRIME
THAT I DIDN'T COMMIT.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.001
- A CRIME
THAT YOU CONFESSED TO.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.103
- I WAS IN THERE ALL NIGHT,
OKAY?

08:56.136 --> 08:58.138
NO FOOD, NO WATER.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.973
I WANTED TO GET OUT
OF THERE.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.008
- THE VICTIM I.D.'D YOU.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.578
YOU HAD HER CREDIT CARDS
WHEN WE ARRESTED YOU.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.880
- I TOLD YOU THAT I FOUND THEM
IN A DUMPSTER.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.016
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN ALIBI, DID YOU?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.952
- I PARTIED ALL NIGHT.
I SMOKED A COUPLE OF JOINTS.

09:11.985 --> 09:12.986
I ALREADY HAD TWO PRIORS.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.288
I COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT.
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.791
YOU'RE SORRY YOU CONFESSED.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.959
SO WHAT'D YOU DO?

09:18.992 --> 09:22.229
GET ONE OF YOUR BOYS
ON THE OUTSIDE

09:22.262 --> 09:24.031
TO COPYCAT YOUR CRIME,
PROVE IT WASN'T YOU?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.066
- NO, MAN.
NO.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.036
- WHO WAS IT, OMAR?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.772
ONE OF YOUR PRISON CELLMATES?

09:31.805 --> 09:34.007
JUST GIVE US HIS NAME.
WE WON'T EVEN CHARGE YOU.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.709
- CHARGE ME?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.611
I'M IN JAIL FOR 300 YEARS.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.980
- AND YOU EARNED
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.750
NOW YOU PUT
ANOTHER WOMAN

09:42.783 --> 09:44.985
THROUGH THIS HORROR
TO MAINTAIN YOUR LIES?

09:45.018 --> 09:48.656
- I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.058
- NO? A WEEK AFTER YOUR FINAL
HEARING WAS DENIED,

09:51.091 --> 09:52.726
THE EXACT SAME DETAILS?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.862
- YEAH, AND WHAT DOES THAT
TELL YOU, HUH?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.296
IT ISN'T ME THIS TIME.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.398
IT WASN'T ME THEN.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.133
YOU GOT SOME SICK PRICK
STILL OUT THERE,

10:00.167 --> 10:01.902
AND INSTEAD OF
LOOKING FOR HIM,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.937
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME ON ME.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.273
- YOU'RE NOT
A WASTE OF TIME.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.009
YOU'RE A WASTE
OF A LIFE.

10:09.042 --> 10:13.046
YOU CONFESSED BECAUSE YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU HAD DONE.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.816
- ALL RIGHT, LIV,
WE'RE DONE HERE.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.219
COME ON.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.921
- [whistles]
DETECTIVE AMARO.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.023
ABOUT THAT CONFESSION,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.926
I TOOK IT BACK
THE FIRST CHANCE I GOT.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.927
SHE TELL YOU THAT?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.062
- YEAH? WHEN WAS THAT?

10:29.096 --> 10:32.365
BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU GOT SENTENCED?

10:32.399 --> 10:34.702
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, OMAR.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.037
- YEAH, SHE DIDN'T CARE.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.340
NOBODY DID!
RIGHT?

10:40.373 --> 10:43.977
ONCE YOU CONFESS,
EVERYBODY STOPS LISTENING!

10:46.013 --> 10:48.949
- PENA'S BEEN BURIED IN LAW
BOOKS EVER SINCE HE GOT HERE.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.183
SENDING LETTERS.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.152
GUYS IN HIS CELL BLOCK
CALL HIM MATLOCK.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.754
- WE'LL NEED A LIST
OF EVERYONE

10:53.787 --> 10:55.756
HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH
ON THE OUTSIDE.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.925
- SHORT LIST.
HE DOESN'T GET ANY VISITORS.

10:57.958 --> 10:58.959
- THERE'S NO FAMILY?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.095
- HIS MOTHER DIED A YEAR
AFTER HE GOT SENT AWAY.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.430
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAME.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.165
- THAT WHEN HE STARTED
HIS LETTER-WRITING CAMPAIGN?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.034
- MORE LIKE
HE BECAME OBSESSED.

11:07.067 --> 11:11.071
20 LETTERS A DAY,
7 DAYS A WEEK.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.106
- OKAY.
THANK YOU.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.009
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IF PENA
HAS SOMEONE ON THE OUTSIDE,

11:16.043 --> 11:17.745
HE DIDN'T WRITE TO THEM.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.113
ALL THESE LETTERS
ARE TO LAWYERS, MINISTERS,

11:20.147 --> 11:22.282
JOURNALISTS, CONGRESSMEN,
THE PRESIDENT.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.117
- OKAY, DID ANYONE
WRITE HIM BACK?

11:24.151 --> 11:28.121
- YEAH, YOUR PAL ELLIS
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.023
TOLD PENA
HE'D LOOK INTO IT.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.291
- LOOK, YOU SHOULD SEE
ELLIS' OFFICE.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.226
HE GETS 100 LETTERS
LIKE THIS A MONTH.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.962
- I'LL PASS.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.897
- HEY.
ANY LUCK AT THE BAR?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.799
- BRAS AND THONGS
ON THE CEILING,

11:38.832 --> 11:40.133
NO SECURITY CAMERAS.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.802
NOBODY EVEN REMEMBERS
SEEING GINA.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.837
- YEAH, WELL, FLEET WEEK
DOESN'T PRODUCE

11:43.871 --> 11:46.039
THE MOST RELIABLE WITNESSES.
- MM.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.076
- AS OF NOW, ALL WE'VE GOT ON
THE SATURDAY NIGHT ATTACKER

11:49.109 --> 11:50.811
IS HE WAS LEFT-HANDED,
LATINO,

11:50.844 --> 11:52.746
AND WAS WEARING A WHITE
SAILOR'S UNIFORM.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.815
- A LEFTY?
- YEAH, FROM THE KNOTS.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.084
CSU IS CHECKING THE ROPE
FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO

11:57.117 --> 11:58.185
TO SEE IF THERE'S A MATCH.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.119
- I GOT A LIST
OF INMATES RELEASED

11:59.152 --> 12:02.055
FROM GREEN HAVEN
SINCE PENA'S BEEN THERE.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.758
CROSS-CHECKED WITH
A NAVY DATABASE, GOT ONE HIT.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.259
MIKE MARTINEZ.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.062
HE'S EX-NAVY,
DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE.

12:09.096 --> 12:09.930
- HOW DID HE WIND UP
IN GREEN HAVEN?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.132
- HE WAS CHARGED
WITH ATTEMPTED RAPE,

12:12.165 --> 12:14.835
BUT HE PLED DOWN TO A FIVE-YEAR
STRETCH FOR ASSAULT.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.070
HE MADE PAROLE
THREE MONTHS AGO.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.072
GET THIS.
THE LAWYER THAT PREPPED HIM--

12:19.106 --> 12:22.375
OMAR PENA.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.148
- OMAR PENA
GOT MARTINEZ OUT.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.120
DO YOU HAVE HIS PAROLE OFFICER?
- YEAH.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.856
- LET'S SEE IF MARTINEZ
PAID BACK THE FAVOR.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.192
[knocking at door]

12:39.226 --> 12:41.161
- GLADYS MARTINEZ.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.197
OPEN UP.
IT'S THE POLICE.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.565
- GLADYS ISN'T HERE.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.002
- UH, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR HER SON MIKE.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.403
- HE'S NOT HERE EITHER.

12:50.437 --> 12:54.207
HE'S AT WORK.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.444
- HOW OLD ARE YOU, HON?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.450
- MARTINEZ, FREEZE!

13:03.483 --> 13:04.818
I'M NOT GOING TO CHASE YOU.

13:04.852 --> 13:10.223
I WILL SHOOT YOUR ASS
FROM RIGHT HERE.

13:10.257 --> 13:14.127
- OKAY, SO SATURDAY...
YOU WERE AT WORK.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.295
- TILL 5:00,
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.130
- THEN SATURDAY NIGHT?
- OUT WITH FRIENDS.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.433
- WHO WERE YOU WITH?
NO NAMES?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.902
SUIT YOURSELF.
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET HOME?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.071
NO ME DIGAS MENTIRAS.
- I WAS OUT ALL NIGHT.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.305
- WAS THAT WHEN
YOU HURT YOUR ARM?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.373
- THAT HAPPENED AT WORK.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.507
- WELL, YOUR BOSS
SAID IT DIDN'T,

13:27.540 --> 13:29.142
SO WHY DON'T WE
CUT THE CRAP?

13:29.176 --> 13:31.845
SATURDAY NIGHT, MIDNIGHT,
WHERE WERE YOU?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.181
- IF I TELL YOU
I WAS GETTING HIGH...

13:34.214 --> 13:35.548
- AH, PENA EVEN
GAVE HIM HIS ALIBI.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.018
- THEN THERE GOES MY PAROLE,
RIGHT?

13:38.051 --> 13:38.852
- WELL, YOU GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN THAT.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.588
- YOU KNOW WHERE
I THINK YOU WERE?

13:41.621 --> 13:45.258
RAPING AND TORTURING

13:45.292 --> 13:47.227
A 23-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.096
- NO, NO!

13:49.129 --> 13:51.865
I AM NOT A RAPIST.
- WELL, YOU GOT CONVICTED ONCE.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.167
- NO, I DID MY BID, AND I G--
I MADE PAROLE.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.568
- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH THE HELP
OF YOUR JAILHOUSE LAWYER

13:55.602 --> 13:56.469
OMAR PENA.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.039
- MATLOCK, YEAH.
HE HELPED ME GET OUT.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.307
- AND THEN HE TOLD YOU
YOU OWED HIM.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.143
- NO!
- HE GIVE YOU THE DETAILS?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.177
HE TELL YOU HOW TO COMMIT
THE CRIME?

14:04.211 --> 14:05.045
- WHAT?

14:05.078 --> 14:07.147
- YOU SEE, MIKE,
WE CAN PUT YOU BACK

14:07.180 --> 14:08.615
IN PRISON RIGHT NOW.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.418
YOU HAD COKE AND WEED
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.887
YOU HAD SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE
GIRL WHO ANSWERED THE DOOR.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.555
- I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK?

14:15.588 --> 14:17.524
THEN WHY DON'T WE HELP
EACH OTHER OUT?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.259
DID PENA EVER TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE CRIME

14:19.292 --> 14:21.061
THAT HE COMMITTED
EIGHT YEARS AGO?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.162
- YEAH, HE KEPT SAYING
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.196
WOULDN'T GIVE IT A REST.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.431
- AND YOU WERE IN THE NAVY,
RIGHT?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.399
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.236
YOU REMEMBER HOW TO TIE KNOTS?
- I GUESS.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.304
- STILL HAVE A UNIFORM?
- AT MY MOM'S.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.605
- MIKE,
HERE'S THE THING.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.342
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A LATINO GUY

14:35.375 --> 14:37.344
WEARING A NAVY UNIFORM

14:37.377 --> 14:39.012
WHO KNOWS HOW
TO TIE A BOWLINE,

14:39.046 --> 14:41.381
WHO KNEW THE DETAILS
OF PENA'S CRIME,

14:41.414 --> 14:43.616
WHO ALSO OWED PENA
A FAVOR.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.617
NOW YOU SEE OUR PROBLEM,

14:44.651 --> 14:47.554
DON'T YOU, MIKE?
ALL OF THOSE THINGS FIT YOU.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.190
- YEAH, BUT I-I--
- SO YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.492
YOU CAN BE STRAIGHT WITH US
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

14:52.525 --> 14:54.561
ON SATURDAY NIGHT,
ABOUT WHAT PENA TOLD YOU TO DO,

14:54.594 --> 14:56.396
AND WE TALK TO THE D.A.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.631
OR YOU CAN SIT HERE,

14:58.665 --> 15:00.367
AND YOU CAN PROTECT
SOMEBODY

15:00.400 --> 15:01.468
THAT DOESN'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT YOU.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.103
SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.537
- I KNOW WHY
YOU THINK I DID THIS.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.275
- AND THE JURY
IS GONNA THINK SO TOO.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.011
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG PENA
WAS SENTENCED FOR?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.180
315 YEARS.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.216
AND WITH YOUR PREVIOUS RAPE,

15:16.249 --> 15:19.252
THE EXACT SAME CRIME, YOU'RE
GONNA GET THE EXACT TIME.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.053
- JUST LET ME THINK.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.255
- THEN WE TELL THE D.A.
THE TRUTH.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.591
THAT YOU WERE SCARED,
MAYBE HE THREATENED YOUR FAMILY.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.193
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
[knock at door]

15:26.226 --> 15:27.961
- THAT'S PROBABLY
THE D.A. NOW.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.297
AND ONCE THEY GET INVOLVED,
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.398
- YOU TELL HIM I'M THINKING.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.233
- YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.435
YOU'RE AT A CROSSROADS
RIGHT NOW.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.638
YOU GOTTA MAKE A DECISION!
- OKAY, OKAY.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.008
- AND IF YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION,

15:41.041 --> 15:44.611
I WILL GO TO BAT
FOR YOU.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.183
- LIV.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.385
- WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
MIKE IS THINKING STRAIGHT.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.520
- BUT BEFORE HE DOES, THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.521
- NICK, I WILL BE
RIGHT THERE.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.358
- YOU NEED TO TAKE
A MINUTE.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.395
- YOU THINK HARD.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.234
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
PULLING ME OUT?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.668
I HAD HIM.
- HE DIDN'T DO IT.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.070
- HE'S GOOD FOR THIS.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.673
- LIV, DNA RESULTS ARE
BACK FROM THE RAPE KIT.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.310
THE LAB FOUND SKIN CELLS
UNDER GINA'S FINGERNAILS

16:17.344 --> 16:18.378
BUT NO HITS ON CODIS.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.446
- MIKE'S DNA
IS IN THE SYSTEM.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.647
IF IT WAS HIM,
WE'D HAVE A MATCH.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.149
- HE WAS ABOUT TO CONFESS.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.185
- DOESN'T MEAN HE DID IT.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.092
- MIKE MARTINEZ
GOES BACK TO GREEN HAVEN

16:32.125 --> 16:35.195
FOR THE STATUTORY RAPE
OF HIS 15-YEAR-OLD GIRLFRIEND,

16:35.228 --> 16:37.730
BUT HE IS NOT GOOD FOR THE RAPE
OF GINA LOGAN.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.699
- BUT HE DID TELL US
HOW PENA KEPT TALKING

16:39.732 --> 16:42.035
ABOUT HOW
HE'S BEING FRAMED.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.803
HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN SOMEBODY
UP THERE TO DO IT.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.539
- IF GINA'S RAPIST
IS REALLY IN THE NAVY,

16:46.573 --> 16:48.675
THEN HIS DNA WOULD BE
ON FILE WITH THEM.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.344
- GREAT.
SO WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.613
HOW'S THE VICTIM DOING?
- I SPOKE TO HER DOCTOR.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.049
SHE'S STABLE AND LUCKY.
HER EYESIGHT IS COMING BACK.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.052
- SEE IF SHE'S UP TO WORKING
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.787
- WE'RE DROPPING PENA
JUST LIKE THAT?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.822
- CAPTAIN,
HE'S GOT TO BE BEHIND THIS.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.591
- LOOK AT THE CRIME SCENES.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.260
I MEAN, THE SLASHINGS.

17:07.294 --> 17:11.331
- THERE IS ONE
OTHER POSSIBILITY.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.834
THE TWO RAPES
COULD BE THE SAME PERP,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.770
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT PENA.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.639
- LET'S NOT GO DOWN
A RABBIT HOLE HERE, NICK.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.808
PENA IS GOOD
FOR THE 2004 RAPE.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.610
IF HE DID SET THIS ONE UP,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.078
HE'S NOT GONNA
WALK US THROUGH IT.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.680
WE NEED TO FIND WHOEVER IT WAS
WHO DID ATTACK HER

17:27.714 --> 17:28.781
AND WALK IT BACK.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.683
- DETECTIVES.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.652
- BAYARD.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.387
- HAVE I COME AT A BAD TIME?

17:34.421 --> 17:37.124
OMAR PENA ASKED ME
TO LOOK INTO HIS CONVICTION.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.525
HE BELIEVES THE REAL RAPIST
WAS NEVER CAUGHT

17:38.558 --> 17:39.526
AND JUST STRUCK AGAIN.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.760
- HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.395
HE SET UP
THE SECOND RAPE,

17:42.429 --> 17:44.131
SO SOMEONE WOULD FALL
FOR HIS STORY.

17:44.164 --> 17:48.801
- THAT STILL
YOUR WORKING THEORY?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.270
- WHAT'S YOURS?

17:50.303 --> 17:51.838
- I'VE HEARD ABOUT
YOUR OLD PARTNER.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.673
IAB HAD A DEEP FILE
ON HIM.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.808
HE WASN'T A STRANGER
TO THREATS, COERCION--

17:55.842 --> 17:57.777
- THIS WASN'T
HIS INTERROGATION.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.379
MUNCH AND FIN TOOK
THE FIRST SHIFT,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.781
AND I TOOK
THE LAST NINE HOURS.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.816
- NINE STRAIGHT HOURS?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.286
- I GAVE HIM BREAKS.
HE KNEW HIS RIGHTS.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.421
- WELL, EVEN SO,
NINE HOURS TAKES A TOLL

18:08.455 --> 18:10.190
ON THE DETECTIVE
AS WELL AS THE DEFENDANT.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.792
- BAYARD,
PENA IS PLAYING YOU.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.495
HE'S WRITTEN
10,000 LETTERS.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.732
- 62,000 ACTUALLY.

18:19.766 --> 18:25.138
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S INNOCENT.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.408
- YOU'RE AWARE THAT BAYARD ELLIS
IS NOW REPRESENTING OMAR PENA?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.377
- SO I'VE HEARD.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.612
- WELL, DON'T LET HIM TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.314
HE HAS AN AGENDA.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.483
HE'S CHALLENGING
POLICE METHODS,

18:36.516 --> 18:39.552
CLAIMING CONFESSIONS
ARE COERCED.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.854
- WELL, THIS ONE WASN'T.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.592
- HOW SURE ARE YOU ABOUT THAT?
- VERY.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.894
OMAR PENA WAS A WASHOUT
FROM THE NAVY

18:47.927 --> 18:50.163
WEARING HIS OLD UNIFORM
FOR FLEET WEEK.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.832
HE KNEW DETAILS OF THE CRIME
THAT WERE NEVER MADE PUBLIC

18:52.865 --> 18:56.203
DOWN TO THE COLOR OF THE SCARF
THAT THE VICTIM WAS GAGGED WITH.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.337
- THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED
TO HEAR.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.872
NOW THAT THERE'S
A COPYCAT RAPIST,

18:59.906 --> 19:01.774
ELLIS WANTS US TO RETEST
THE OLD EVIDENCE

19:01.808 --> 19:03.410
FOR THE NEW RAPIST'S DNA.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.144
I'LL BE DENYING
HIS REQUEST.

19:10.583 --> 19:14.487
- SO WE'RE GOOD?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.256
- YEAH.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.361
THANKS FOR COMING IN,
DETECTIVE.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.830
GIVE MY BEST
TO YOUR CAPTAIN.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.577
- ANY HITS ON THE SKETCH?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.712
- NO, LOOKS LIKE
HALF THE SAILORS

19:39.746 --> 19:40.847
IN TOWN
FOR FLEET WEEK.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.450
- YEAH, PLUS MOST OF THE
POSSIBLE WITNESSES WERE DRUNK.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.351
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT GINA?

19:44.384 --> 19:47.220
SHE ABLE TO GIVE US
ANY MORE DETAILS?

19:47.254 --> 19:49.289
- NOT MANY, BUT SHE'S SURE
IT WAS A NAVY UNIFORM.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.457
- JUST LIKE PENA.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.525
- YEAH, BUT WE KNOW
IT'S NOT HIM.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.893
- YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.229
HE COULD'VE SLIPPED THAT DETAIL
TO HIS COPYCAT.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.231
- [sighs]

19:58.265 --> 20:01.268
- NICK, IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY, JUST SAY IT.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.969
- OKAY.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.272
LOOK, I'M NOTICING
INCONSISTENCIES.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.440
YOUR ROPE GUY
SAID THE KNOTS

20:07.474 --> 20:09.709
FROM '04 WERE MADE
BY A LEFTY.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.244
- YEAH, AND HE'S POSITIVE.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.845
- WELL, PENA'S LETTERS--
FROM THE HANDWRITING,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.247
LOOKS LIKE HE'S RIGHT-HANDED.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.582
- SO YOU'RE
A HANDWRITING EXPERT?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.484
- LIV, THAT'S EASY
TO CONFIRM.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.253
- LOOK, WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING
ON GINA'S RAPIST.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.254
- WE ARE DEAD-ENDED

20:21.288 --> 20:23.323
ON LEADS
FROM GINA'S ATTACK.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.658
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR US TO GO BACK,

20:25.692 --> 20:28.828
SEE IF MAYBE WE MISSED ANYTHING
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

20:28.861 --> 20:29.962
OKAY?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.764
NOW THAT CASE
HAD WITNESSES

20:31.798 --> 20:33.966
WHO PUT PENA IN THE BAR
WITH THE VICTIM?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.635
- YES, HALF A DOZEN
OF THEM.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.003
- OKAY, WELL, THE SHIPS
ARE BACK IN TOWN.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.771
MAYBE SOME OF THE WITNESSES
ARE TOO.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.740
SEE IF YOU CAN SHAKE
THE OLD I.D.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.277
YOU TWO, GO BACK, REINTERVIEW
THE VICTIM, ARIEL BASKINS,

20:44.311 --> 20:46.346
AND SHOW HER
THIS NEW SKETCH.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.514
- SHE PICKED PENA.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.816
- SHOW HER
THIS NEW SKETCH.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.386
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE PERP HERE,

20:53.420 --> 20:57.290
NOT A COPYCAT.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.525
- I'VE GONE OVER THE CASE.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.926
I GET WHY YOU'RE SURE
PENA'S GUILTY.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.662
- DON'T WORK ME, NICK.
- THAT CONFESSION--

21:02.695 --> 21:04.331
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
HE CAVED UNDER PRESSURE

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
AND JUST WANTED IT
TO STOP?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.867
- LOOK, WE HAD OUR GUY,
SO YES, I PUSHED HARD.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.370
- OH, LIKE YOU DID
WITH MIKE MARTINEZ?

21:10.403 --> 21:11.404
HE WASN'T GOOD
FOR GINA'S RAPE,

21:11.438 --> 21:14.006
BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO COP
TO BEING SET UP BY PENA.

21:14.040 --> 21:14.807
HEY, I'VE BEEN RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.310
I'VE GOTTEN SO INVOLVED
IN A CASE,

21:17.344 --> 21:18.077
I'VE LOST PERSPECTIVE

21:18.110 --> 21:19.779
AND TAKEN DOWN A GUY
WHO I KNEW

21:19.812 --> 21:20.780
WAS GUILTY
OF SOMETHING.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.982
- I TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.353
IF I DON'T HAVE THAT,
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.595
- LOOKS LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY
ON MY SHIP.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.863
- JAVIER,
YOU'RE THE THIRD WITNESS

21:36.896 --> 21:37.997
TO TELL US
THE SAME THING.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.800
- WELL, IT'S NOT THE MAN
FROM EIGHT YEARS AGO, PENA.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.770
I TESTIFIED AT THE GRAND JURY.
I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.405
- SO YOU SAW PENA
IN THE BAR?

21:45.438 --> 21:48.408
- UH, MY FIRST TIME
IN THE COUNTRY,

21:48.441 --> 21:50.109
MY SHIPMATES--THEY TOLD
ME AND MARCO TO GO DOWN

21:50.142 --> 21:51.978
TO THE BULKHEAD TAVERN.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.581
ALL THE CUTE GIRLS WERE THERE.
- AND HE WAS WITH THE VICTIM?

21:54.614 --> 21:57.550
- HE HAD HIS HANDS ON HER.
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

21:57.584 --> 21:58.851
- HAD YOU BEEN DRINKING?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.920
- OF COURSE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:00.953 --> 22:03.823
- YOU'RE ASKING ME IF THIS GUY
WAS IN THE BAR EIGHT YEARS AGO?

22:03.856 --> 22:05.758
HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?
- COME ON, MARCO.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.027
WHEN YOU I.D.'D OMAR PENA,
HOW DID IT GO DOWN?

22:08.060 --> 22:09.929
- I PICKED HIM OUT
OF A LINEUP.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.631
I KNEW THE GUY RIGHT AWAY.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.935
UM, I REMEMBER BECAUSE HE BUMMED
A CIGARETTE OFF OF ME EARLIER.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.538
- SOMETHING ELSE I REMEMBER.
- MM-HMM.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.873
- HE WAS JUST STARING AT HER,
YOU KNOW?

22:20.907 --> 22:23.376
AND HE TAPPED HER
ON THE SHOULDER.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.912
SHE BLEW HIM OFF.
THAT POOR GIRL.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.880
WHAT HE DID TO HER--
HORRIBLE.

22:27.914 --> 22:28.748
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.651
- THANK YOU.
- UH-HUH.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.852
- IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.053
I'VE REALLY TRIED
TO PUT THIS BEHIND ME.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.489
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

22:36.523 --> 22:39.459
- AND WE WOULDN'T ASK YOU
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT, OKAY?

22:39.492 --> 22:40.560
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE MAN

22:40.593 --> 22:42.929
WHO DID THIS TO YOU
STAYS IN PRISON.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.131
SO WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP,
ARIEL.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.833
- HE'S GETTING OUT?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.636
- HE HAS A LAWYER

22:49.669 --> 22:52.539
WHO'S TRYING
TO REOPEN THE CASE.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.642
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO GO OVER EVERY SINGLE DETAIL

22:55.675 --> 22:56.943
TO MAKE SURE,
OKAY?

22:56.976 --> 22:59.946
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU NEED
TO KNOW?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.718
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.827
- UM, I RECOGNIZE
THE UNIFORM.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.095
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FACE?

23:16.128 --> 23:18.197
DO YOU REMEMBER
SEEING HIM

23:18.230 --> 23:20.867
OR TALKING TO HIM IN THAT BAR
EIGHT YEARS AGO?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.169
- NO, THE MAN IN THE BAR
WAS OMAR PENA.

23:23.202 --> 23:27.574
HE FOLLOWED ME.
HE RAPED ME.

23:27.607 --> 23:31.911
- ARIEL,
DID YOU SEE HIS FACE

23:31.944 --> 23:34.681
WHILE HE WAS
ATTACKING YOU?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.683
- I SAW HIS UNIFORM.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.850
I WAS TRYING
TO REMEMBER DETAILS,

23:37.884 --> 23:40.787
AND HE--HE MUST HAVE
SEEN ME LOOKING,

23:40.820 --> 23:41.788
AND SO HE SPLASHED ME
IN THE FACE.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.657
- RIGHT, SO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM
FROM THE BAR,

23:44.691 --> 23:45.658
NOT FROM THE ATTACK?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.794
- IT WAS HIM.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.228
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE ASKING ME ALL OF THIS.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.931
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF
HE KNEW ALL THOSE DETAILS.

23:51.964 --> 23:56.636
HE KNEW ABOUT THE SCARF
THAT HE USED TO GAG ME WITH.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.970
I HAVEN'T WORN RED SINCE.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.974
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

24:02.008 --> 24:05.478
YOU SAID, "RED"?

24:05.512 --> 24:07.847
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THE SCARF WAS RED?

24:07.880 --> 24:11.984
- YES, IT WAS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
FROM MY MOTHER.

24:12.018 --> 24:15.622
SAID IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BRING ME LUCK.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.057
TELL ME
HE'S NOT GETTING OUT.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.095
- HEY, LIV,
SLOW DOWN.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.864
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:24.897 --> 24:28.968
- ONE OF THE DETAILS
THAT ONLY THE RAPIST WOULD KNOW.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.140
THERE'S THE PAPERWORK.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.207
WHEN OMAR CONFESSED,

24:35.241 --> 24:39.078
HE SAID THAT HE USED
A GREEN SCARF TO GAG ARIEL.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.647
- YOU SURE?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.081
- I'VE GONE OVER MY NOTES
ON THIS CASE

24:42.114 --> 24:44.016
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT
SINCE GINA WAS RAPED.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.518
IT WAS THE ONE DETAIL
THAT CONVINCED US

24:45.552 --> 24:46.519
THAT OMAR WAS GUILTY.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.055
- AND JUST NOW ARIEL SAID
THE SCARF WAS RED.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.057
- DID YOU FIND IT
ON THE WORKSHEET?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.058
- YEAH, HERE WE GO.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.193
THE OFFICER
WHO VOUCHERED IT

24:54.226 --> 24:57.229
LISTED IT AS GREEN.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.804
- DOES THAT LOOK GREEN
TO YOU?

25:11.143 --> 25:15.214
- AND YOU WEREN'T
AT THE CRIME SCENE?

25:15.247 --> 25:19.151
- I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL
WITH ARIEL.

25:19.185 --> 25:23.055
- SO YOU QUESTIONED PENA
OFF AN EVIDENCE LOG

25:23.089 --> 25:24.924
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WAS WRONG.

25:24.957 --> 25:30.096
- AT SOME POINT, I MUST HAVE
MENTIONED THE GREEN SCARF.

25:30.129 --> 25:34.834
AND THEN WHEN HE WAS TIRED
AND EXHAUSTED

25:34.867 --> 25:38.004
AND CONFUSED, HE MUST HAVE
REPEATED IT BACK TO ME.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.072
- PUT HIMSELF AWAY
FOR 300 YEARS.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.341
- HE RECANTED.

25:42.374 --> 25:48.681
HE KEPT TELLING ME
THAT HE WAS INNOCENT.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.350
[sighs]

25:51.383 --> 25:54.854
[breathing heavily]

25:58.257 --> 26:00.192
- THE OFFICER WAS COLOR-BLIND?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.694
HOW DID HE GET
ON THE FORCE?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.863
- HE WAS FINE WHEN HE CAME OUT
OF THE ACADEMY,

26:03.896 --> 26:07.199
BUT BY 2004,
HE HAD EARLY STAGE M.S.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.336
AND ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS--
- COLOR BLINDNESS.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.339
[chuckles] SO HE LOGS IN
A RED SCARF AS GREEN?

26:13.372 --> 26:16.976
ANYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG--

26:17.009 --> 26:20.012
- I MUST HAVE MENTIONED
THAT DETAIL TO HIM,

26:20.046 --> 26:22.749
AND THEN HOURS LATER,
HE REPEATED IT BACK TO ME.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.752
- IT COULD'VE BEEN A DETECTIVE
WHO INTERROGATED PENA EARLIER.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.254
- DOESN'T MATTER.
THE CONFESSION'S NO GOOD.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.724
- I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.159
- WE'RE NOT POINTING
FINGERS HERE.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.994
IF PENA'S CONFESSION
WAS COMPROMISED,

26:35.027 --> 26:37.764
AND HE'S PETITIONING
FOR A DNA TEST, HE DESERVES ONE.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.967
- A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
YOUR DETECTIVE ASSURED ME

26:41.000 --> 26:42.334
THAT I HAD
A GOOD CONFESSION.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.803
I TOOK HER WORD
ON THAT.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.071
WE'RE ALL OUT
ON A LIMB HERE.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.238
- PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.907
DETECTIVE BENSON
HAS STEPPED FORWARD.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.175
- I AM NOT ARGUING CHARACTER.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.078
THIS IS ABOUT PERCEPTION.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.783
ELLIS IS GONNA TURN THIS
INTO AN INDICTMENT

26:56.816 --> 27:00.720
OF BOTH OF OUR OFFICES.

27:00.753 --> 27:04.123
- OKAY, LET ME TALK
TO ELLIS AND TELL HIM

27:04.156 --> 27:06.859
THAT THIS WAS ENTIRELY
MY MISTAKE.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.260
- DON'T BARE YOUR NECK
TO A WOLF.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.796
JUST TELL HIM THAT
THE D.A.'S OFFICE

27:09.829 --> 27:12.832
WILL MOVE TO GET
THE DNA TEST APPROVED.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.913
- WE FOUND MATCHING
TOUCH DNA ON THE ROPES

27:26.946 --> 27:28.681
AT BOTH CRIME SCENES.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.416
THAT MEANS IT WASN'T YOU,
OMAR.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.352
THEY'RE REOPENING THE CASE.

27:33.385 --> 27:37.156
AT THE VERY LEAST,
IF IT HAS TO GO TO RETRIAL,

27:37.189 --> 27:39.959
THERE WILL BE
REASONABLE DOUBT.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.128
- OMAR.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.830
- WHAT?

27:43.863 --> 27:48.701
A REINVESTIGATION?
A RETRIAL?

27:48.735 --> 27:50.136
YOU WANT A GOLD MEDAL NOW?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.904
HUH?
YOU'RE TELLING ME SOMETHING

27:51.938 --> 27:55.141
THAT I TOLD YOU
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.475
- TAKE IT EASY, OMAR.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.144
- I'M INNOCENT.
I DON'T WANT A RETRIAL.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.912
I WANT THEM
TO VACATE MY CONVICTION.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.014
- THERE IS LIGHT
AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL.

28:02.048 --> 28:09.488
- I'LL BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I'M OUT.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.860
- THE CONFESSION
WAS ALL MY FAULT.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.328
I WORKED HIM HARD.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.298
I TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD
ALL KINDS OF EVIDENCE.

28:19.331 --> 28:23.369
I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS
GOING AWAY NO MATTER WHAT.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.971
I BROKE HIM.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.739
- YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB.

28:26.773 --> 28:31.744
- I FORCED A FALSE CONFESSION.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.980
ARE THERE OTHERS?

28:34.013 --> 28:37.817
I LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.786
- OLIVIA.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.054
- I'VE SEEN GOOD OLD BOY
DETECTIVES PULL THIS.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.957
AND I TOOK PRIDE IN KNOWING
THAT I WASN'T ONE OF THEM.

28:44.991 --> 28:49.161
- BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.430
YOU STEPPED FORWARD.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.479
- HOW DID IT GO
AT GREEN HAVEN YESTERDAY?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.782
- HOW DO YOU THINK?

29:09.816 --> 29:11.851
- YOU KNOW, MUNCH AND I
HAD PENA FIRST.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.020
IT COULD'VE BEEN ONE OF US
WHO SLIPPED UP ON THAT SCARF.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.555
- DOESN'T MATTER.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.058
SO WHERE ARE WE ON CATCHING
THE REAL RAPIST?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.894
- NOWHERE BUT SOMEWHERE.

29:21.928 --> 29:22.795
IT TURNS OUT THAT
THERE ARE MORE

29:22.829 --> 29:24.463
THAN THE TWO RAPES
THAT HAPPENED HERE.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.999
WE GOT THREE OTHER DNA HITS

29:27.033 --> 29:28.434
FROM INTERPOL.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.102
- WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

29:30.136 --> 29:33.439
- THREE SEXUAL ASSAULTS--
ONE IN BUENOS AIRES IN 2006,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.207
ANOTHER IN NAPLES, ITALY,
'08,

29:35.241 --> 29:36.976
AND THEN ROTA, SPAIN,
2009.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.311
- SO OUR SERIAL RAPIST
STARTS HERE

29:39.345 --> 29:42.248
IN 2004 WITH ARIEL,
THEN MOVES ON TO OTHER PORTS.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.584
- UNTIL HE COMES BACK,
RAPES GINA LOGAN.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.886
SAME M.O.?
- YEP.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.821
UNIFORM, AMMONIA,

29:48.855 --> 29:50.923
ALL COMMITTED BY A SINGLE
UNKNOWN SUSPECT.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.859
- SO THESE ARE ALL
PORT CITIES,

29:52.892 --> 29:55.594
SO, YOU KNOW, I CHECKED
THE SPECIFIC DATES.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.897
THEY ALL MATCH UP WITH
INTERNATIONAL FLEET WEEK EVENTS.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.199
- WE KNOW THE RAPIST
ISN'T U.S. NAVY.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.201
THEY'D HAVE HIS DNA
ON FILE.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.137
- SO THESE NAVAL UNIFORMS--

30:05.171 --> 30:09.008
HOW DIFFERENT ARE THEY
FROM ONE COUNTRY TO THE NEXT?

30:09.041 --> 30:11.043
- MY CLIENT HAS BEEN WRONGFULLY
IMPRISONED FOR EIGHT YEARS.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.845
HOW MUCH LONGER
DOES HE HAVE TO WAIT?

30:12.879 --> 30:15.447
- CAN'T LET PENA OUT UNTIL
WE COMPLETE OUR INVESTIGATION.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.349
THE DNA RESULTS ALONE
AREN'T EXCULPATORY.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.985
- PAIRED WITH
A FALSE CONFESSION,

30:19.018 --> 30:21.153
THE HELL THEY AREN'T.
- HANG ON A MINUTE.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.956
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER EVIDENCE
BESIDES PENA'S CONFESSION.

30:23.990 --> 30:24.991
VICTIM PICKED HIM
OUT OF A LINEUP.

30:25.024 --> 30:28.327
SIX WITNESSES I.D.'D HIM
IN A BAR HARASSING HER.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.462
HE GETS ARRESTED WITH
THE VICTIM'S CREDIT CARDS.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.632
IT'S, UH, NOT A SLAM DUNK
FOR A DISMISSAL.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.035
- CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
BAD I.D.s.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.137
- THERE'S NO MALICE HERE.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.941
NOT FROM THE D.A.'S OFFICE,
NOT FROM NYPD.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.375
DETECTIVE BENSON
IS KILLING HERSELF

30:43.409 --> 30:44.443
TRYING TO MAKE
THIS THING RIGHT.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.046
YOU SAW HER WITH PENA.
- YES, I KNOW.

30:47.079 --> 30:50.482
- SHE'S TAKING THIS
PERSONALLY.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.352
SHE'S NOT ONE OF THOSE
GOOD OL' BOY DETECTIVES.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.353
THIS IS A POINT

30:54.386 --> 30:57.389
OF PRIDE WITH HER.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.094
- MAY I ASK WHEN
DETECTIVE BENSON

31:02.128 --> 31:03.662
TOLD YOU ABOUT
OUR VISIT TO PENA?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.631
- EXCUSE ME?

31:05.664 --> 31:09.401
- YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?

31:09.435 --> 31:13.539
I WAS WITH HER ON THE TRAIN,
SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN...

31:13.572 --> 31:18.410
LAST NIGHT.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.012
- WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME?

31:20.046 --> 31:22.081
- I'M CURIOUS.

31:22.114 --> 31:25.918
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE NATURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

31:30.089 --> 31:31.357
- I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.160
- DOES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
KNOW?

31:36.695 --> 31:39.331
I'VE GOT AN INNOCENT MAN
IN PRISON,

31:39.365 --> 31:42.168
AND APPEARANCES SUGGEST
THAT THE DETECTIVE

31:42.201 --> 31:43.169
WHO COERCED
THE CONFESSION

31:43.202 --> 31:46.172
IS INVOLVED
WITH THE A.D.A.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.408
WHOSE OFFICE
IS REINVESTIGATING THE CASE.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.312
- YOU KNOW US BOTH
BETTER THAN THAT.

31:53.345 --> 31:58.450
- THEN I KNOW YOU'LL BOTH
DO THE RIGHT THING HERE.

32:02.054 --> 32:05.257
[door slams]

32:05.291 --> 32:07.659
- I DON'T GET IT.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.128
ELLIS KNOWS
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP

32:09.161 --> 32:11.163
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS CASE.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.200
- HE DOES,
BUT IT GIVES HIM A GRENADE.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.634
- OKAY, SO WE HAVE
NO CHOICE.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.170
WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE.
- NO, IT'S TOO LATE.

32:18.204 --> 32:22.674
THIS COMES OUT NOW,
AFTER I VOUCHED FOR YOU,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.076
WE LOSE OUR CAREERS.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.012
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE D.A.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.179
WON'T RELEASE PENA.

32:27.213 --> 32:32.284
- IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY,
OLIVIA.

32:32.318 --> 32:36.122
OVERTURNING A GUILTY PLEA
WITH THAT MUCH EVIDENCE--

32:36.155 --> 32:37.289
IT HAS TO GO
THROUGH A PROCESS.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.391
- OKAY, SO HOW DO WE
SPEED IT UP?

32:39.425 --> 32:41.260
HOW DO WE GET OMAR
OUT OF PRISON?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.162
- IF YOU FIND
THE REAL RAPIST,

32:43.195 --> 32:46.432
TIE HIM
TO BOTH CASES,

32:46.465 --> 32:48.434
THAT EXONERATES PENA
COMPLETELY.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.102
- AND IF WE DON'T?

32:50.136 --> 32:53.739
- ELLIS HAS TO PLAY
HIS HAND.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.080
[engine starts]

33:01.113 --> 33:03.615
[seat belt alert beeps]

33:06.218 --> 33:07.419
- CAN I DROP YOU SOMEWHERE?

33:07.453 --> 33:10.522
- I'LL GET HOME
ON MY OWN.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.403
[knock on door]

33:24.436 --> 33:25.637
- BAYARD?

33:25.671 --> 33:28.640
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

33:28.674 --> 33:29.741
- SURE. COME IN.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.478
- THANK YOU.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.346
- UH, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

33:36.182 --> 33:40.386
- DAVID HADEN AND I...

33:40.419 --> 33:42.321
IT'S NOT SOME CONSPIRACY.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.223
- NO, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.659
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING...

33:47.693 --> 33:49.295
I KNOW THAT IT'S FOR OMAR,

33:49.328 --> 33:51.097
AND I HOPE
THAT YOU KNOW ME

33:51.130 --> 33:52.298
WELL ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

33:52.331 --> 33:54.533
THAT WE WANT THE SAME THING.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.670
- I DO.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.572
BUT HOW DO I TELL OMAR

34:00.606 --> 34:02.374
I HAVE A WAY FOR HIM
TO GET OUT TODAY,

34:02.408 --> 34:04.276
BUT I CAN'T USE IT BECAUSE

34:04.310 --> 34:05.844
TWO PEOPLE MIGHT
LOSE THEIR JOBS.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.680
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I DO, BUT...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.616
I'M NOT HERE TO PLEAD
FOR MY CAREER

34:10.649 --> 34:11.850
OR FOR DAVID'S...

34:11.883 --> 34:14.353
- I WOULD EXPECT, IF DAVID HADEN
HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME,

34:14.386 --> 34:16.522
HE'D SAY IT HIMSELF.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.424
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.431
IS THERE ANY PART OF THIS
THAT'S...

34:25.464 --> 34:27.266
ABOUT HIM?

34:27.299 --> 34:30.469
AND YOU, AND ME?

34:32.304 --> 34:35.274
- UM, I WOULD HOPE
YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH

34:35.307 --> 34:37.543
NOT TO HAVE TO ASK
THAT QUESTION.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.779
- OKAY.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.615
POINT TAKEN.

34:43.649 --> 34:49.255
- SO...WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

34:49.288 --> 34:52.824
- GIVE ME TIME.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.793
IF WE ARREST
THE REAL RAPIST,

34:54.826 --> 34:57.529
THEN OMAR GETS OUT.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.198
- HOW LONG?

34:59.231 --> 35:01.433
- A WEEK.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.403
OR I WILL GO
TO THE D.A. MYSELF

35:04.436 --> 35:07.206
AND TELL HIM EVERYTHING.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.552
- SO WHERE ARE WE
WITH FOREIGN MILITARY?

35:20.586 --> 35:22.388
- WELL, THE STATE DEPARTMENT
WAS ABLE TO GET ACCESS

35:22.421 --> 35:24.656
TO A DATABASE
OF INTERNATIONAL SHIP LOGS.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.393
OKAY, SO THREE FOREIGN VESSELS
MADE PORT STOPS

35:27.426 --> 35:28.594
THAT MATCH
ALL OF THE ATTACKS.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.163
- YEAH, A CANADIAN DESTROYER,
COLOMBIAN MARINE CRUISER,

35:31.197 --> 35:32.431
AND A BRAZILIAN FRIGATE.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.233
- GINA AND ARIEL
BOTH SAID

35:34.266 --> 35:35.667
THAT THE RAPIST
NEVER SPOKE.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.170
IT COULD BE BECAUSE HE HAD
AN IDENTIFIABLE ACCENT.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.738
- BUT YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE UNIFORM.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.274
LOOK AT THIS.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.444
CANADIAN NAVY
AND COLOMBIAN MARINES

35:45.477 --> 35:46.678
WEAR DIFFERENT COLORS
AND DIFFERENT TYPE SHIRTS,

35:46.712 --> 35:49.548
BUT CHECK THIS OUT.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.350
- BRAZILIAN NAVY--
THAT UNI

35:51.383 --> 35:52.684
LOOKS VERY SIMILAR
TO OURS.

35:52.718 --> 35:53.952
- YEAH, IT'S EASY

35:53.985 --> 35:56.455
FOR A WITNESS OR A VICTIM
TO CONFUSE.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.658
- OKAY, SO THE BRAZILIAN SHIP
THAT MATCHED--THE MARANHAO--

35:59.691 --> 36:02.661
IT'S LEAVING TOMORROW, BUT RIGHT
NOW IT'S DOCKED AT PIER 88.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.963
- SO WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO 3,000 SUSPECTS.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.798
- WE ALREADY KNOW
A FEW OF THEM.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.701
I MEAN, JAVIER, MARCO--
THEY WERE WITNESSES AT THE BAR.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.371
WE REINTERVIEWED THEM THE OTHER
DAY RIGHT BY THEIR SHIP.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.441
- JAVIER POINTED THE FINGER
AT OMAR EIGHT YEARS AGO.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.509
IF HE'S THE RAPIST,
HE HAD MOTIVE TO SET HIM UP.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.446
- ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE START
AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT,

36:20.479 --> 36:23.582
LET'S GET PHOTOS OUT
TO THE VICTIMS.

36:29.388 --> 36:34.293
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HIM.

36:34.326 --> 36:39.398
WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.712
- THAT'S THE MAN
WHO RAPED ME.

36:53.745 --> 36:54.980
I'M POSITIVE.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.915
WHERE IS HE?
DID YOU FIND HIM?

36:56.948 --> 37:01.920
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT,
GINA.

37:01.953 --> 37:06.292
- HE'S BEEN DOING THIS
FOR EIGHT YEARS?

37:06.325 --> 37:09.561
[crying] SO IF YOU HADN'T
PUT AWAY THE WRONG MAN,

37:09.595 --> 37:11.997
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ME!

37:16.602 --> 37:17.569
- I'M SORRY, GINA.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.905
- [sobs]

37:22.408 --> 37:25.511
- THAT'S TWO FOR TWO.
- RIGHT, THANKS.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.846
ARIEL ALSO I.D.'D JAVIER.
- WE GOTTA PICK HIM UP.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.649
- WE MAY BE TOO LATE.
THAT WAS FIN.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.818
JAVIER'S BUDDY MARCO
IS STILL ONSHORE,

37:32.851 --> 37:34.686
BUT JAVIER'S ALREADY
BOARDED THE SHIP.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.655
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE DOCKED
IN OUR JURISDICTION.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.989
WHAT'S TO STOP US
FROM JUST GOING ON BOARD

37:38.023 --> 37:39.525
AND ARRESTING HIM?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.627
- ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.728
I SPOKE TO HADEN.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.630
NO WAY
BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES

37:44.663 --> 37:46.798
WILL TURN OVER A SAILOR
TO U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.400
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT STATE?

37:48.434 --> 37:49.668
- WELL, IT COULD TAKE
DAYS TO GO

37:49.701 --> 37:51.570
THROUGH THE PROPER
DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.639
- WE DON'T HAVE DAYS.
THEY SAIL TOMORROW.

37:53.672 --> 37:54.473
- YEAH, BUT JAVIER
DOESN'T KNOW THAT

37:54.506 --> 37:55.441
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR HIM YET, RIGHT?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.376
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE TOO HARD
TO GET A SAILOR

37:57.409 --> 38:00.078
TO GO ON SHORE LEAVE.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.814
[rock music]

38:02.848 --> 38:04.783
- CLASSY PLACE.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.385
- OWNER'S A RETIRED COP.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.553
DOING US A SOLID.

38:07.586 --> 38:12.891
THINK HE MISSES
THE ACTION.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.961
- JAVIER JUST LANDED.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.002
- MARCO.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.571
DIDN'T THINK, UH,
MY FRIEND COULD HANDLE

38:25.604 --> 38:27.706
ANOTHER NIGHT
OF PARTYING.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.808
NOT TOO MANY GIRLS.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.877
- AINDA E CEDO, CARO.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.812
- SO LAST NIGHT--
WHAT IS THIS?

38:33.845 --> 38:36.615
- YOUR GOING AWAY PARTY.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.985
- [grunting]

38:40.018 --> 38:43.822
- WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE
A LEFTY, HUH, JAVIER?

38:43.855 --> 38:47.493
- [panting]

38:49.895 --> 38:51.597
- THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE

38:51.630 --> 38:53.599
THE PEOPLE NO LONGER
MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF,

38:53.632 --> 38:55.701
AND WE MOVE
TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.736
- MR. HADEN?

38:57.769 --> 39:00.906
- THE D.A.'S OFFICE
HAS NO OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.776
WE FULLY SUPPORT
THIS REQUEST.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.912
- MR. PENA...

39:06.945 --> 39:10.048
GIVEN THE NEW EVIDENCE
PRESENTED HERE TODAY

39:10.081 --> 39:12.851
AND THE GRAVE MISCARRIAGE
OF JUSTICE,

39:12.884 --> 39:15.621
THIS COURT SINCERELY
APOLOGIZES

39:15.654 --> 39:17.723
AND WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO BE INCARCERATED

39:17.756 --> 39:19.791
FOR ONE MINUTE LONGER.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.628
PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK CODE
OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE,

39:22.661 --> 39:25.030
ARTICLE 440.10,
I HEREBY VACATE

39:25.063 --> 39:27.699
THE JUDGMENT AGAINST YOU.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.167
YOU'RE A FREE MAN, SIR.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.869
[pounds gavel]

39:37.676 --> 39:40.546
- [crying softly]

39:48.787 --> 39:50.088
[knock on door]

39:50.121 --> 39:52.057
- [sighs] SO I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH THE LAB,

39:52.090 --> 39:53.959
AND THEY'VE CONFIRMED
THAT JAVIER'S DNA

39:53.992 --> 39:56.061
IS A MATCH TO ALL
FIVE CRIME SCENES.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.063
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU GOT YOUR GUY.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.865
- [sighs]

39:59.898 --> 40:02.801
- LIV, I WANT TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS-UP.

40:02.834 --> 40:07.138
THE D.A. HAS DECIDED TO START UP
A CONVICTION INTEGRITY UNIT

40:07.172 --> 40:08.707
ON PAST CASES.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.976
- OKAY.
- AND...

40:11.009 --> 40:12.844
THEY'RE GONNA START BY TAKING
A LOOK AT SEX CRIMES.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.747
- SO TWO DAYS AGO,
THE D.A. WAS CONTENT

40:15.781 --> 40:17.716
TO LET PENA ROT
IN PRISON,

40:17.749 --> 40:19.184
AND NOW HE WANTS
TO PLAY THE HERO?

40:19.217 --> 40:21.753
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

40:21.787 --> 40:22.788
BY THE WAY, UH,
DAVID HADEN

40:22.821 --> 40:26.792
WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE UNIT.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.895
- GOOD TO KNOW.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.140
- NIGHT.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.676
- YOU TOO.

40:44.710 --> 40:45.911
NICK.
- YEAH.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.948
- YOU'RE A GOOD PARTNER.

40:59.758 --> 41:03.795
SO...CHIEF HADEN.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.232
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.801
- THANK YOU.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.738
IT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING.

41:12.771 --> 41:13.905
I ASKED BAYARD ELLIS
TO BE

41:13.939 --> 41:15.907
A MEMBER OF MY OUTSIDE
ADVISORY PANEL.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.844
- I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT HE'S A JOINER.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.278
- [chuckles]

41:20.311 --> 41:22.147
GUESS WE'LL SEE.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.250
- SO...
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

41:25.283 --> 41:27.953
- IN CONFLICT.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.691
I'M GONNA BE LOOKING INTO CASES
THAT YOU HANDLED.

41:32.724 --> 41:35.527
- AND WE NEVER DISCLOSED.

41:35.561 --> 41:38.897
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.867
BUT THAT MEANS
I'D HAVE TO RESIGN.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.637
- WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

41:45.671 --> 41:46.938
IT'S WHAT YOU LIVE FOR.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.174
- SAYS WHO?
- SAYS YOU.

41:49.207 --> 41:53.111
THE FIRST TIME YOU WALKED
INTO OUR SQUAD ROOM.

41:53.144 --> 41:57.182
- I'D BE ASSIGNED
TO YOUR CASES.

41:57.215 --> 42:00.051
[sighs]

42:06.692 --> 42:07.859
YOU KNOW, THAT--
THAT MEANS WE--

42:07.893 --> 42:11.697
- [quietly]
I KNOW.

42:11.730 --> 42:16.935
US...

42:16.968 --> 42:21.707
THIS...

42:21.740 --> 42:24.275
NEVER HAPPENED.
