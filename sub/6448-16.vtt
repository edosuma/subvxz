Previously on smallville.

00:02.143 --> 00:04.770
<i>Just listen.
That's when you let go.</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:10.660
Doctor fate's final act was to restore
my martian abilities.

00:10.785 --> 00:13.982
So I will continue to protect
and serve using every tool I've got.

00:15.524 --> 00:17.685
This blood confirms my suspicions.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.459
These things are alien.

00:19.831 --> 00:21.718
I need a blood sample analyzed.

00:25.471 --> 00:28.110
- You're the one they call watchtower.
- Who are you?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.448
They came after us. They'll come after
all of you.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.469
- Check.
- Check what?!

00:35.536 --> 00:38.417
Agent mercer.
We have a lot to catch up on.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.763
There's an army of heroes growing.

00:43.785 --> 00:45.502
Someone's collecting them.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.664
It's just a question of who.

00:47.924 --> 00:50.859
Welcome to the suicide squad.

05:20.507 --> 05:22.462
You could use
some conflict resolution.

05:24.136 --> 05:26.142
Rule number one...
You don't shoot your date.

05:26.267 --> 05:28.791
Rule number two. Think
about your wardrobe choices.

05:28.916 --> 05:30.021
You're one to talk.

05:30.146 --> 05:33.382
Don't get me wrong. I love black on
black. It's really hard to pull off.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.959
It's easier than you think.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.481
And rule number three...

05:41.939 --> 05:44.515
You got to know
when to say good night.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.686
Checkmate.

07:10.194 --> 07:13.351
- did you try the power switch?
- Didn't you see my texts? 

07:13.476 --> 07:15.373
I lost oliver. He was tracking
some armed men,

07:15.498 --> 07:16.942
followed them under the monorail,

07:17.067 --> 07:19.268
then it was like
a massive mute button went on...

07:19.522 --> 07:21.713
- No radio, no beacon, nothing.
- I'm sure it's fine.

07:21.838 --> 07:23.712
Just because he doesn't check in...

07:23.837 --> 07:26.551
unlike some people, oliver actually
follows protocol.

07:26.676 --> 07:29.156
- What protocol?
- Exactly.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.357
He and everyone else dial in
with watchtower while they're on patrol.

07:32.482 --> 07:35.613
You spend so much time
watching everybody else's back,

07:35.738 --> 07:38.087
you forget that we need to watch
each other's backs, too.

07:39.789 --> 07:42.925
This isn't about us. Did you
check the local security cameras?

07:43.050 --> 07:46.239
Every surveillance feed is down. Atms,
traffic lights, convenience stores.

07:46.364 --> 07:49.635
It's like someone threw a big
blanket over the whole area.

07:55.873 --> 07:57.649
You fixed it.

07:57.774 --> 08:00.343
Or whoever did this
finished what they started.

08:03.721 --> 08:06.828
- Where is that?
- That's where I saw oliver last.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.740
Your buddy system works.

08:16.393 --> 08:18.121
I didn't call him.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.587
What are you doing here?

08:36.712 --> 08:38.653
Looking for any sign of oliver.

08:41.385 --> 08:43.345
You didn't know he was missing?

08:45.965 --> 08:48.694
He was here on patrol
when watchtower lost contact.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.170
I'm here on police business.

08:51.295 --> 08:52.905
But I'll keep an eye out.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.805
It'll be faster if we work together.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.735
Unless you've already
found something.

09:02.205 --> 09:04.040
You need to trust me, clark.

09:05.050 --> 09:06.420
You first.

09:16.754 --> 09:18.599
What do you know, john?

09:21.058 --> 09:22.992
You shouldn't have done that, clark.

09:46.799 --> 09:48.574
Radio ahead.

09:48.699 --> 09:50.735
We're 20 minutes to the airfield.

10:09.902 --> 10:12.918
Stand down, agent mercer.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.132
You know the rules.

10:16.257 --> 10:18.647
You don't have clearance
to peek under the hood.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.884
I was just making sure that our
acquisition was still secure.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.186
I'm sure you were.

10:24.837 --> 10:26.083
Congratulations.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.901
You were able to re-engage
so quickly after being dormant

10:31.026 --> 10:32.488
so long.

10:34.335 --> 10:35.880
Dismissed.

10:52.882 --> 10:56.613
Green arrow, welcome to checkmate.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.865
I think you've got
the wrong green arrow.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.459
I don't remember signing up
for any chess club.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.704
You are a guest
of the u. s. Government.

11:06.829 --> 11:10.032
And the time has come for you
to do your patriotic duty.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.213
Yeah, I didn't know uncle sam
was into drugs and bondage.

11:13.382 --> 11:16.181
Kind of gives a whole new meaning to
the "i want you" posters, doesn't it?

11:16.306 --> 11:19.510
I'm sorry you think
these tactics are crude.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.644
But I fear
for our country's security.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.022
That's why I'm recruiting
capable people like you.

11:25.147 --> 11:26.798
Recruitment?

11:26.923 --> 11:29.952
I got to tell you, t feels more like
kidnapping than a booth at a job fair.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.997
Call it what you want.

11:32.193 --> 11:35.033
But it's time you elevated
your service to your country.

11:35.158 --> 11:38.127
You have a long plane ride
coming to think it over.

12:56.938 --> 12:58.247
What do you want?

12:58.372 --> 13:01.041
I'm afraid
you've made a critical error.

13:03.336 --> 13:05.199
I believe this is yours.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.532
Tell me the location
of checkmate's headquarters.

13:15.657 --> 13:17.200
The place you call the castle.

13:17.325 --> 13:18.672
Who are you working for?

13:19.026 --> 13:22.591
Someone who will not hesitate
to expose your double life.

14:25.905 --> 14:28.679
Clearly, you are rusty.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.912
You think I didn't know
the second we lost him?

14:34.536 --> 14:37.533
Did you properly secure
the detainee?

14:40.222 --> 14:42.297
He had a hidden lock pick.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.128
The correct answer is

14:45.253 --> 14:49.257
"no, I did not properly secure
the detainee"!

14:53.168 --> 14:55.288
I'm disappointed, tess.

14:56.628 --> 14:59.359
Green arrow
may not have been the endgame,

14:59.484 --> 15:01.927
but he was our opening move.

15:03.097 --> 15:04.945
I can get him back.

15:05.386 --> 15:07.488
I'll set a new net myself.

15:10.768 --> 15:14.772
You skipped...
A few check-ins...

15:15.064 --> 15:17.196
The last few years.

15:17.879 --> 15:20.668
Maybe your loyalties lie
with someone else.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.866
I swear...

15:27.455 --> 15:29.698
I am fully committed to checkmate.

15:29.823 --> 15:31.570
You better be.

15:32.011 --> 15:34.293
Or you're out.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.269
And we both know
there is only one way out.

15:54.293 --> 15:57.304
Seems to be taking longer than normal
to find an earwig serial number.

15:57.429 --> 15:58.944
That's because someone's hidden it

15:59.069 --> 16:01.254
but after cross-referencing
those last four digits,

16:01.379 --> 16:04.331
I think that the earpiece
in john's pocket was government-issued.

16:04.456 --> 16:06.936
Why would the government
take green arrow?

16:07.061 --> 16:10.302
Considering what I pay out every year,
it better not be for tax evasion.

16:11.227 --> 16:13.566
Oh, my god.
You're safe.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.807
Of course I'm safe.

16:19.607 --> 16:21.283
I'm glad you're safe, too.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.278
You want to fill us in
on what happened?

16:26.447 --> 16:29.013
- Definitely.
- Absolutely. So, let's see.

16:29.138 --> 16:31.360
One minute, I am
saving someone's bacon.

16:31.485 --> 16:33.963
Next thing I know, I'm the
only pig on a pork-chop express.

16:34.088 --> 16:35.832
Some harpy gets on a monitor.

16:35.957 --> 16:38.388
She starts telling me
this is the welcome wagon

16:38.513 --> 16:40.603
and she's recruiting heroes
for the u. s. Of a.

16:40.728 --> 16:43.477
- I'm guessing you didn't get the evite.
- No, Someone else did.

16:43.602 --> 16:46.190
And that explains why john jones
was covering for them.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.401
Did this woman give you her name?

16:48.766 --> 16:50.866
No name.

16:52.062 --> 16:54.110
Wait a minute...
Check... Mate?

16:54.972 --> 16:57.186
When sylvester pemberton
from the justice society

16:57.311 --> 16:58.779
was murdered, he warned me that,

16:58.904 --> 17:00.837
<i>"they came after us,
and they'll come after you."</i>

17:01.187 --> 17:02.811
His dying word was "check."

17:03.081 --> 17:06.183
If he meant "checkmate," these are
the same people who took down the jsa.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.492
I searched
the archived security footage

17:08.617 --> 17:10.967
that was taken from the cameras
across the city.

17:11.092 --> 17:13.026
This was taken a few hours ago.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.744
That was right after
I confronted him. Who's he talking to?

17:21.409 --> 17:23.546
We got a hit
from the passport agency.

17:23.671 --> 17:25.414
Edward lott.

17:25.539 --> 17:28.253
He's the c. e.o. Of a
consumer manufacturing company.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.653
He seems pretty high-profile
for a secret-agent man.

17:30.778 --> 17:33.718
Maybe they recruit people that are
established in the private sector.

17:34.048 --> 17:35.498
Or plant them there.

17:37.885 --> 17:40.329
You're not gonna be happy
where he was planted next.

17:40.454 --> 17:42.766
Within an hour
after this footage was taken,

17:42.891 --> 17:45.604
he was on the list
of metropolis general morgue.

17:49.563 --> 17:52.955
Slow down, guys. You can't think
john murdered this guy. Come on, now.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.812
Clark, I'll come with you.
I can...

17:55.937 --> 17:58.195
support onsite.

17:58.781 --> 18:00.913
Looks like you got benched.

18:02.601 --> 18:05.228
Sylvester pemberton came
to warn me about checkmate

18:05.353 --> 18:07.090
the moment
that he was attacked by...

18:07.215 --> 18:08.782
Icicle.

18:10.017 --> 18:13.362
Either that's quaintly coincidental
or he's working for the same lovely lady

18:13.487 --> 18:15.677
whose gaze
wilts small trees. What do you think?

18:15.846 --> 18:17.924
Last I heard, he was
in the psych ward at met gen.

18:18.527 --> 18:19.836
Let's go.

18:19.961 --> 18:21.803
You know, oliver...

18:21.928 --> 18:24.641
Now that green arrow is
officially on checkmate's radar,

18:24.766 --> 18:27.710
I think it might be a good idea for you
to just hang your tights for one night.

18:28.169 --> 18:30.123
Go civilian.

18:31.438 --> 18:32.902
They're not tights.

18:33.207 --> 18:35.293
They're not tights.

18:35.943 --> 18:38.420
But I see your point.
Yeah.

18:38.545 --> 18:39.822
Unfortunately for me,

18:39.947 --> 18:43.282
that means attending a luthorcorp
shareholder dinner, which...

18:43.407 --> 18:45.118
Yeah, i'd rather be shot at.

18:52.711 --> 18:55.384
I was just gonna say
be careful out there, 'cause it...

18:56.227 --> 18:58.947
There's checkmate agents
everywhere, so...

18:59.184 --> 19:00.846
Be careful.

19:16.383 --> 19:17.717
You're late.

19:20.123 --> 19:22.660
If you know what's good for you,
don't start.

19:23.404 --> 19:25.768
<i>Whatever kind of day
you think you've had,</i>

19:25.893 --> 19:27.667
trust me, I've had it in spades.

19:28.763 --> 19:31.920
What happened?
The jet late leaving paris?

19:32.248 --> 19:35.496
- The beluga not the right temperature?
- That's very, very funny.

19:35.621 --> 19:37.686
You might want to save
the song-and-dance routine

19:37.811 --> 19:40.298
for the shareholders
when you try to explain to them,

19:40.423 --> 19:43.181
the sketchy deal
with china. It's terrible.

19:44.745 --> 19:47.030
So that's what got you out
of bed before the dinner bell.

19:47.155 --> 19:50.309
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Barely had time to change clothes.

19:50.624 --> 19:51.922
I can tell.

19:52.786 --> 19:54.538
Black on black.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.654
That's hard to pull off.

19:57.823 --> 19:59.692
It's easier than you think.

20:11.172 --> 20:12.906
Green arrow.

21:29.028 --> 21:32.081
Thank you for coming,
detective jones.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.834
You know who I am.

21:36.223 --> 21:38.444
Don't be so naive.

21:39.393 --> 21:41.747
Where's the rest of your team?

21:42.260 --> 21:43.900
I came alone.

21:44.465 --> 21:45.808
All for the better.

21:45.933 --> 21:49.435
I was hoping I would get
the chance to enlist you.

21:50.204 --> 21:53.640
But I have the feeling
somebody already has...

21:54.412 --> 21:57.877
Somebody with
a very high level of intel.

22:03.610 --> 22:06.576
You came for what's in there,
didn't you?

22:07.054 --> 22:09.285
That doesn't belong to you.

22:10.491 --> 22:13.590
That blood traveled light-years
to get here.

22:14.161 --> 22:16.338
And it's foreshadowing a threat

22:16.463 --> 22:18.665
we will not take lightly.

22:19.815 --> 22:23.546
Your preparations for war
are unnecessary.

22:23.671 --> 22:25.648
You're simply reacting out of fear.

22:25.773 --> 22:27.273
Fear?

22:28.396 --> 22:30.874
Fear is what prompts us
to protect ourselves.

22:32.129 --> 22:36.133
And studying fear gives us
insight to others' phobias.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.191
A police detective
who won't go near fire.

22:46.894 --> 22:50.076
Makes it hard to protect
and serve, doesn't it?

22:58.939 --> 23:01.838
Excuse me.
Those are my charts.

23:03.177 --> 23:05.615
Dr. Brenner.
I was looking for you.

23:05.740 --> 23:08.005
You were the evaluating doctor
on several patients

23:08.130 --> 23:10.821
who came through
the psych ward in met gen who were

23:10.946 --> 23:12.721
- Special.
- Unless you are

23:12.846 --> 23:15.616
directly related, i'm afraid
I can't discuss patient information.

23:15.741 --> 23:17.967
None of them
actually made it to belle reve

23:18.092 --> 23:20.369
<i>after you signed off
on their transfer,</i>

23:20.494 --> 23:22.104
including cameron mahkent.

23:22.229 --> 23:23.694
Once I sign off,

23:23.819 --> 23:26.688
those people belong to belle reve.
Why don't you take it up with them?

23:26.813 --> 23:30.212
That's the thing. Belle reve was never
even notified that they were coming.

23:30.958 --> 23:32.473
Look, young lady,

23:32.598 --> 23:35.841
if you don't leave immediately,
I will call security.

23:36.124 --> 23:39.584
No. That's not necessary. I was
just trying to get some answers.

23:50.857 --> 23:53.404
I'm sorry.
Perhaps I was a bit abrasive.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.837
It's been a really long day.

23:55.962 --> 23:57.654
I'll tell you what.

23:57.779 --> 23:59.896
Why don't I walk you
down to archives,

24:00.021 --> 24:01.898
and we'll see
if we can't clear this up?

24:03.103 --> 24:05.485
That's the bedside manner
they say has been missing.

24:17.650 --> 24:20.252
Please follow me this way
to the dining room.

24:32.430 --> 24:35.300
The only way you'd get me
back in here is by force.

24:37.804 --> 24:39.714
Don't flatter yourself.

24:39.839 --> 24:42.450
The best thing I ever did in
this bed was kick you out of it.

24:42.575 --> 24:44.552
That's something out of
your mouth I can believe.

24:44.677 --> 24:46.454
So it's you...

24:46.579 --> 24:49.488
Parading around
in tacky green leather.

24:52.007 --> 24:53.594
It was me.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.633
I can't believe you wear tights.

24:55.758 --> 24:57.125
<i>They're not tights.</i>

25:06.266 --> 25:07.866
They're not tights.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.301
<i>They look like tights.</i>

25:11.151 --> 25:13.948
You've been keeping more secrets
than lex ever had. Isn't that right?

25:15.245 --> 25:17.676
Who knows how many deals
were sealed right here?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.711
You buried an arrow into my chest.

25:20.518 --> 25:23.146
Actually...
It was a taser.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.550
Well, it bruised.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.501
Better bruised than dead.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.503
What, are you crazy?
This isn't a cartoon.

25:35.628 --> 25:37.072
You're gonna hurt somebody.

25:37.197 --> 25:39.741
- That's the basic idea.
- All right, then.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.998
- Don't you come near me.
- Stop.

25:42.936 --> 25:44.636
Stay out of this, clark.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.712
Our little lady here
is a checkmate agent.

25:48.274 --> 25:50.756
- She knows my identity.
- Not just yours.

25:51.076 --> 25:53.021
Tess, I need some answers.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.080
<i>I'm not telling you anything.</i>

25:55.842 --> 25:57.597
Maybe the view
will change your mind.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.622
Let me down from here!

26:05.593 --> 26:07.807
Tell me about checkmate. No lies.

26:13.733 --> 26:16.144
A month after I started
working at luthorcorp,

26:16.269 --> 26:18.504
I was approached by the white queen.

26:18.629 --> 26:20.414
It's waller's code name.

26:20.539 --> 26:22.878
She wanted information about
lex's alien investigations.

26:23.003 --> 26:24.647
At first, I thought she was crazy.

26:24.772 --> 26:26.709
But then lex's files
changed your mind.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.490
After I took over luthorcorp,

26:29.615 --> 26:32.360
<i>I saw she knew
a lot more than I did.</i>

26:32.485 --> 26:35.563
But I swear. I never told her
the kryptonians were here.

26:35.688 --> 26:37.678
I never told her about you.

26:38.557 --> 26:41.059
I wouldn't believe
your dying breath.

26:42.495 --> 26:44.837
None of this should have happened.

26:44.962 --> 26:47.188
Oliver wasn't even the real target.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.857
- <i>Then who was?</i>
- I don't know.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.569
Something they called "watchtower."

27:14.776 --> 27:17.444
What the hell do you want?
Round 2?

27:18.239 --> 27:20.262
Oliver, clark's in trouble.

27:22.093 --> 27:24.795
If you wanted a rematch,
all you had to do was ask.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.233
I'm serious.

27:28.924 --> 27:31.668
He made me tell him where
checkmate's headquarters are

27:31.793 --> 27:34.818
after he found out they captured
something called "watchtower."

27:41.637 --> 27:44.883
Somebody get in here!
Soldiers! I need your help!

27:46.341 --> 27:47.540
Get me out of here!

27:47.843 --> 27:49.749
The prisoner overpowered me!

27:53.715 --> 27:56.281
No alarms have been reported yet.

27:58.094 --> 27:59.520
There's no sign of jones.

28:09.131 --> 28:11.074
That's because i'm still here.

28:37.132 --> 28:41.069
I must say, I liked your colors
better when they were more Patriotic.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.429
Kidnapping is illegal...
Even for the government.

28:46.199 --> 28:49.097
I don't have time
for polite requests.

28:49.222 --> 28:52.139
I have reason to believe
there are aliens among us.

28:53.551 --> 28:56.911
They have designs much bigger
than just getting green cards.

28:59.414 --> 29:01.140
I need your help.

29:01.265 --> 29:02.644
To do what?

29:04.057 --> 29:06.994
Chase down rumors
and u. f.o. Stories?

29:07.163 --> 29:10.373
What if I have proof...
Actual alien blood?

29:10.993 --> 29:13.999
The keystone to world war iii?

29:15.121 --> 29:17.540
Maybe these aliens aren't here
to start a war.

29:17.665 --> 29:20.875
<i>If you don't stand with us,
you stand against us.</i>

29:21.510 --> 29:23.750
It's time for you to pick a side.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.935
Maybe this will help
your indecisiveness.

29:31.949 --> 29:34.272
Stand ready for immediate orders.

29:36.061 --> 29:37.687
Let her go.

29:37.812 --> 29:39.915
I'm not being unreasonable.

29:40.369 --> 29:43.662
If you step forward,
out of the shadows,

29:44.025 --> 29:46.074
I will let watchtower go.

29:53.363 --> 29:55.378
Release her now.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.872
You sure are nice to look at.

29:58.788 --> 30:01.742
But I like to have my cake
and eat it, too.

30:04.422 --> 30:07.513
I want your loyalty to checkmate.

30:08.150 --> 30:11.443
Anything happens to me,
and bye-bye, blondie.

30:12.587 --> 30:14.665
I know you're fast.

30:14.790 --> 30:18.162
But you can't stop a bullet when
you don't know where she is.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.035
That would be murder.

30:21.897 --> 30:23.808
It's not murder.
It's strategy.

30:23.933 --> 30:27.310
Something you could have used
more of before coming here.

30:27.435 --> 30:28.825
What more do you want?

30:30.922 --> 30:34.926
The location of watchtower's
central database.

30:37.478 --> 30:39.827
You're after everyone
who's ever worked at watchtower.

30:39.952 --> 30:41.986
Names, faces, addresses.

30:42.111 --> 30:45.790
The black canary, impulse,
aquaman, cyborg.

30:46.421 --> 30:48.331
I need people with the abilities

30:48.456 --> 30:50.757
to end the war
quickly and decisively.

30:53.328 --> 30:54.809
It's your move.

31:07.475 --> 31:10.520
Even if I gave you
watchtower's database,

31:10.645 --> 31:12.243
you know i'll come after you.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.257
The blur.

31:14.382 --> 31:17.828
He patrols the streets of metropolis,
protecting every citizen he can.

31:17.953 --> 31:21.957
But He lets the most valuable ally

31:22.283 --> 31:23.755
fend for herself.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.131
I did not abandon her.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.952
Didn't you?

31:27.329 --> 31:30.297
You left your greatest asset
vulnerable.

31:33.301 --> 31:35.378
All you have to do to save her life

31:35.503 --> 31:37.769
is give one simple address.

31:45.429 --> 31:47.028
Come in, white queen.

31:47.349 --> 31:48.696
Come in, white queen.

31:52.203 --> 31:54.119
Showing external power breach.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.357
Am I clear to shoot?
Over.

32:53.212 --> 32:55.768
Boy, am I glad
to see your friendly face.

32:56.866 --> 32:58.371
Did you...

32:58.496 --> 32:59.968
No. I didn't tell her anything.

33:00.093 --> 33:01.769
At least we have that.

33:02.727 --> 33:04.440
I'm sorry, chloe.

33:04.902 --> 33:06.870
I'm sorry for everything.

33:07.390 --> 33:10.227
I think we're both a day late
and a dollar short in that department.

33:12.819 --> 33:14.720
But I abandoned you.

33:14.845 --> 33:18.224
I keep seeing you on the sidelines
but the truth is, with watchtower,

33:18.349 --> 33:20.190
you're right in the middle
of the game.

33:20.882 --> 33:22.862
You didn't abandon me.

33:22.987 --> 33:25.031
You pushed me out of the way.

33:25.156 --> 33:27.066
Maybe I thought
you'd be safer there.

33:27.191 --> 33:29.005
Maybe you just didn't trust me.

33:30.273 --> 33:32.538
I've broken your confidence in me.

33:32.663 --> 33:35.319
You saw watchtower
as big brother and you turned away.

33:35.444 --> 33:38.361
The less you confided in me,
the less you have to depend on me.

33:39.723 --> 33:42.238
It's smart... Probably.

33:44.045 --> 33:46.355
I didn't give you enough credit.

33:47.578 --> 33:49.588
You're the one
who brought us together.

33:49.713 --> 33:52.015
You're the one
who saw our potential.

33:57.023 --> 33:59.224
That potential's
gonna be short-lived.

33:59.508 --> 34:03.092
Waller saw our faces and she's
not gonna stop coming after us.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.286
Tell me you caught them.

34:20.898 --> 34:23.809
I can't wait to see
the defeat on their faces.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.610
I didn't think you were gonna show.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.260
I figure it's a public place.

35:01.385 --> 35:03.659
There's only so many weapons
you can throw at me.

35:05.454 --> 35:06.780
I'm sorry.

35:08.404 --> 35:12.025
For everything I've done
that's destroyed your trust.

35:15.433 --> 35:17.803
I don't think there's enough
stationery for that, tess.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.881
I told you how to shut down
the castle's power grid.

35:25.636 --> 35:28.124
That's worth something, isn't it?

35:31.148 --> 35:33.862
What am I supposed to do here?
You want me to do,

35:33.987 --> 35:37.196
handstands because you helped solve
a problem that you created?

35:37.321 --> 35:39.050
I never would have gone after you

35:39.175 --> 35:41.597
<i>if I had known
that you were the green arrow.</i>

35:41.766 --> 35:43.056
<i>So, it's back on me?</i>

35:45.529 --> 35:48.409
This might be the last time
that I ever see you.

35:50.663 --> 35:53.164
When I joined checkmate,
I took an oath.

35:55.317 --> 35:57.626
An oath I want to break.

35:58.234 --> 36:00.967
But there's only one way
to leave checkmate.

36:19.029 --> 36:20.616
What are you gonna do?

36:23.194 --> 36:25.234
I'm gonna go awol.

36:26.412 --> 36:28.558
I'm gonna go underground.

36:34.011 --> 36:36.873
That's good. I got to ask you
a question, though.

36:36.998 --> 36:39.402
Did it hurt to do something
moral for once?

36:39.527 --> 36:41.203
Did it hurt you?

36:45.705 --> 36:48.580
I'm taking a chance just being
out here with you in the open.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.736
I understand that.
We've gotten that far.

36:50.861 --> 36:53.844
What is it that you want? You're asking
me for something. What do you want?

36:56.495 --> 36:59.311
Forgive me, oliver.

37:05.509 --> 37:08.016
Oliver, I need your help.

37:11.615 --> 37:13.515
Please.

37:20.558 --> 37:23.551
There are times
when I wish I could go back...

37:24.610 --> 37:27.056
Those santorini sunsets...

37:27.705 --> 37:29.408
Your freckles...

37:29.533 --> 37:32.332
And your big dreams
of changing the world.

37:34.171 --> 37:36.048
Back When I could trust you.

37:38.304 --> 37:40.424
Then you betrayed me, tess.

37:45.594 --> 37:47.389
You, of all people.

38:00.422 --> 38:02.445
And if you ever...

38:02.955 --> 38:06.372
<i>Come near me or my friends
ever again...</i>

38:08.071 --> 38:11.068
I will expose you
to the world. Do you understand?

38:33.555 --> 38:35.675
Thanks for keeping my seat warm
at watchtower.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.677
You're welcome.
Don't get used to it.

38:37.802 --> 38:39.457
But your timing is so good.

38:39.582 --> 38:42.479
If you hadn't flipped that castle's
electric switch when you did,

38:43.413 --> 38:46.010
But, I kind of liked
being out in the field,

38:46.135 --> 38:48.220
knowing I had a warm bed
to come home to.

38:48.345 --> 38:50.212
That's very, very funny.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.740
It scared the life out of me.

38:57.438 --> 38:59.502
You better be careful, ollie.

39:00.057 --> 39:02.292
I'm gonna start to think
you're falling for me.

39:21.214 --> 39:23.693
Your identity's safe...
For now.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.539
She's not wrong, you know... Waller.

39:29.969 --> 39:31.596
How so?

39:32.470 --> 39:34.166
When I saw the future,

39:34.291 --> 39:36.979
zod and his people had
already started world war iii,

39:37.104 --> 39:38.625
and we weren't winning.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.021
She was right about being prepared.

39:44.301 --> 39:46.078
Because as much as I want to believe

39:46.203 --> 39:48.635
that I've stopped that day
from happening, it still might.

39:50.025 --> 39:51.971
You don't have to join her.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.290
No.

39:56.216 --> 39:58.424
But, like she said, eventually
I have to choose sides.

39:58.549 --> 39:59.810
You can't.

40:03.409 --> 40:05.992
You are here for something
far greater.

40:06.996 --> 40:09.292
You will be the ambassador

40:09.783 --> 40:12.326
who bridges all the sides together.

40:17.345 --> 40:20.119
What were you doing, john?
Why not include the rest of us?

40:24.413 --> 40:26.545
I would have told the team
what was going on.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.290
But I wanted
you and the rest of them

40:30.415 --> 40:32.842
to stay off checkmate's radar.

40:34.039 --> 40:36.431
But you're not in this alone.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.911
Who are you working for?

40:42.235 --> 40:44.052
Let's just say that...

40:45.748 --> 40:48.659
There are more players
on the board than you think.

40:49.817 --> 40:52.401
And when it comes
to choosing sides...

40:54.314 --> 40:56.536
things aren't always
black and white.

41:02.033 --> 41:05.858
I want the report
of agent mercer's last physical.

41:05.983 --> 41:07.620
When our system's back up,

41:07.745 --> 41:10.093
do you want to move forward
with our operation?

41:13.119 --> 41:15.973
- Who's been in here?
- No one. We're secured.

41:22.951 --> 41:25.944
We won't be renewing the operation.

41:26.655 --> 41:29.361
We've been blocked by a new player.

41:33.510 --> 41:35.450
It's time for a new game.

41:35.931 --> 41:39.231
Synchro: Flolo
