00:01.502 --> 00:03.504
NARRATOR:

00:01.502 --> 00:03.504
<i>Okay, big stuff, friends,</i>

00:01.502 --> 00:03.504
<i>so buckle in.</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:07.048
<i>As you know, Jane and Michael</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:07.048
<i>had a fairy tale wedding,</i>

00:07.048 --> 00:08.676
<i>but it turned into a nightmare,</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:12.095
<i>but thankfully,</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:12.095
<i>Michael survived and thrived.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:13.597
<i>So, it was a huge shock when...</i>

00:13.597 --> 00:14.640
I didn't pass my physical.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.308
I can't go back

00:14.640 --> 00:16.308
to the force.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.101
NARRATOR:

00:16.308 --> 00:18.101
<i>Which meant he needed</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:18.101
<i>a new career.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:20.228
How about a lawyer?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.228
NARRATOR:<i> Exciting, right?</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:22.815
<i>Now all he had to do</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:22.815
<i>was pass the LSAT.</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:24.733
<i>And speaking</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:24.733
<i>of big career moves,</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.695
<i>Rogelio wanted to cross over</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:27.695
<i>from telenovelas,</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:30.447
<i>so he shot a revealing part</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:30.447
<i>in an indie film.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:32.658
<i>Yup. Really revealing.</i>

00:32.658 --> 00:34.201
<i>And as for Jane's mom, Xo...</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:36.662
<i>well, she was back</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:36.662
<i>with her old flame, Bruce.</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:39.581
<i>The only problem?</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:39.581
<i>His daughter, Tess.</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:42.001
<i>Barf. Sorry,</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:42.001
<i>I shouldn't say that,</i>

00:42.001 --> 00:43.711
<i>but trust me, she's tough.</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:45.379
<i>Also tough, Petra.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.215
<i>Or she was before</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.215
<i>her sister, Anezka,</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.009
<i>paralyzed her</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.009
<i>and took her place.</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:51.886
<i>And ever since</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:51.886
<i>Petra woke up, well...</i>

00:51.886 --> 00:54.763
<i>she's been having a hard time</i>

00:51.886 --> 00:54.763
<i>connecting with her kids.</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:57.641
<i>Also having a hard time,</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:57.641
<i>poor Rafael.</i>

00:57.641 --> 01:00.185
<i>See, he had covered up</i>

00:57.641 --> 01:00.185
<i>his late father's crimes,</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:01.729
<i>but then he found out</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:01.729
<i>his parents</i>

01:01.729 --> 01:03.355
<i>weren't really his parents,</i>

01:03.355 --> 01:05.774
<i>and he found an addendum</i>

01:03.355 --> 01:05.774
<i>to his father's will,</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:09.361
<i>which would make him,</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:09.361
<i>well, broke. Then again...</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:11.363
If you're looking for the will,

01:09.361 --> 01:11.363
it's over. I destroyed it.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.699
NARRATOR:

01:11.363 --> 01:13.699
<i>Or at least</i>

01:11.363 --> 01:13.699
<i>she thought she did.</i>

01:13.699 --> 01:16.117
<i>I know. Straight out</i>

01:13.699 --> 01:16.117
<i>of a telenovela, right?</i>

01:16.117 --> 01:18.913
<i>Which, of course, it is,</i>

01:16.117 --> 01:18.913
<i>after all.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:25.753
<i>Looking back, you could say</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:25.753
<i>it felt different right away,</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:30.340
<i>which might be true,</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:30.340
<i>or might just be memory.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.134
<i>In any case,</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.134
<i>when Michael Cordero Jr.</i>

01:33.134 --> 01:34.428
<i>was seven years old,</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:37.431
<i>he had the worst day</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:37.431
<i>of his life.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:41.268
Honey, I'm sorry, you're sick,

01:37.431 --> 01:41.268
so no trick-or-treating.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.228
But I feel totally fine.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.732
NARRATOR:

01:43.228 --> 01:46.732
<i>Of course, young Michael</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:46.732
<i>was an unreliable narrator...</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:47.942
You have a fever.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.693
NARRATOR:<i> Which I'm not.</i>

01:47.942 --> 01:49.693
Come on.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.779
Smile for me

01:49.693 --> 01:51.779
in your costume,

01:51.779 --> 01:53.572
and then we'll get

01:51.779 --> 01:53.572
you into your pjs.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.908
( camera clicks, whirs )

01:55.908 --> 01:57.076
MICHAEL:

01:55.908 --> 01:57.076
Oh, man.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.661
I remember this

01:57.076 --> 01:59.661
moment exactly.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.081
Well, not exactly.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.081
Oh.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.415
You were seven.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.709
Plus, the act of remembering

02:03.415 --> 02:05.709
changes things.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.127
I read this article

02:05.709 --> 02:07.127
in<i> The New Yorker.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
NARRATOR:

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
<i>Show off.</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:09.755
It was about flashbulb memories.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.339
NARRATOR:

02:09.755 --> 02:11.339
<i>Oh, yeah, I read that one.</i>

02:11.339 --> 02:13.008
( flash pops )

02:13.008 --> 02:15.844
<i>Apparently, memories around</i>

02:13.008 --> 02:15.844
<i>big events seem clearer,</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:17.846
<i>but the periphery disappears.</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:21.141
<i>You remember the feeling,</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:21.141
<i>not the details.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.477
No. I remember it exactly.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.477
<i>He doesn't.</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:24.979
'Cause it was so traumatizing.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.063
<i>You can trust me.</i>

02:26.063 --> 02:27.940
Okay, okay, I believe you.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.151
( laughs )

02:31.151 --> 02:32.360
( knock on door )

02:32.360 --> 02:34.321
( cell phone rings )

02:34.321 --> 02:36.448
Hello?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.448
Hey, Alice.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.200
I have huge news!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.661
Wait, wait, what?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.745
Uh, yes, of course.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.788
Tell me about the job.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.123
ALICE:

02:42.788 --> 02:44.123
<i>Chloe Leland</i>

02:44.123 --> 02:46.333
is in the market

02:44.123 --> 02:46.333
for a new assistant.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.168
You know who she is, right?

02:46.333 --> 02:49.168
Total wunderkind. And it's...

02:49.168 --> 02:51.046
$40,000 a year,

02:49.168 --> 02:51.046
plus benefits?

02:51.046 --> 02:53.048
<i>And you know why her</i>

02:51.046 --> 02:53.048
<i>current assistant is leaving?</i>

02:53.048 --> 02:55.509
Because he's getting

02:53.048 --> 02:55.509
his book published.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.551
By Chloe?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.053
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

02:58.053 --> 02:59.513
Please, give her my résumé. Yes.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.722
Thank you.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.474
Okay, bye.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.642
This job sounds amazing.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.352
$40,000 a year.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.562
Plus benefits.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.562
That would be huge.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.899
Right?

03:07.562 --> 03:10.899
Hey, what's wrong, sweet boy?

03:10.899 --> 03:13.068
Well, if you must

03:10.899 --> 03:13.068
know, I had some

03:13.068 --> 03:15.403
big news myself,

03:13.068 --> 03:15.403
that I was excited to share.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.156
Oh. Sorry about that.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.156
What is it?

03:17.156 --> 03:18.490
Never mind,

03:17.156 --> 03:18.490
you stole my thunder.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.075
Dad.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.075
Okay, here it is.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.576
JANE: Oh, no, Mateo.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.576
( Mateo vomits )

03:21.576 --> 03:23.745
Ugh. Uh.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.503
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

03:31.503 --> 03:33.588
( keys clacking )

03:35.632 --> 03:37.718
JANE:

03:35.632 --> 03:37.718
I hope he's not coming down

03:35.632 --> 03:37.718
with a stomach bug.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.636
MICHAEL:

03:37.718 --> 03:39.636
Maybe it was

03:37.718 --> 03:39.636
the chicken last night.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.305
I woke up feeling a little off.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.305
Thought it was pretest jitters.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.390
Well, how do you feel now?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.975
Totally fine.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.351
Rogelio,

03:44.975 --> 03:46.351
you were about

03:46.351 --> 03:48.854
to tell us something.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.854
Oh, since you asked,

03:48.854 --> 03:50.522
they are screening

03:48.854 --> 03:50.522
a-a rough cut

03:50.522 --> 03:52.691
of my film, uh, tomorrow night

03:50.522 --> 03:52.691
for friends and family.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.819
NARRATOR:

03:52.691 --> 03:55.819
<i>Ah, yes. His full-frontal</i>

03:52.691 --> 03:55.819
<i>Fassbender moment.</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:57.529
MICHAEL:

03:55.819 --> 03:57.529
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.531
I have my last LSAT prep class.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.282
I'll have to see it

03:59.531 --> 04:01.282
at Sundance.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.994
From your lips

04:01.282 --> 04:03.994
to Robert Redford's ears.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.579
But, Jane,

04:03.994 --> 04:05.579
you're coming, right?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.665
I, uh...

04:08.665 --> 04:10.876
I mean, it's...

04:10.876 --> 04:12.544
it's just so soon.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.088
I thought I'd have more time

04:12.544 --> 04:14.088
to prepare.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.839
Oh, come on. I told you

04:14.088 --> 04:15.839
I'll give you a heads up

04:15.839 --> 04:16.882
before the naked shot

04:16.882 --> 04:17.799
so you can look away.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.134
Promise?

04:17.799 --> 04:19.134
Yes.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.469
And look,

04:19.134 --> 04:21.469
stills for my fan club.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.013
Oh! Dad, put that back.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.766
But I signed my name

04:23.013 --> 04:25.766
over my goodies.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.103
Fine.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.645
But you are coming, right?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.942
I thought you were

04:32.355 --> 04:34.942
in just the one scene.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.611
Yeah, but I made up

04:34.942 --> 04:37.611
the invitations.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.243
You're not going

04:42.199 --> 04:44.243
to that, are you?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.243
No.

04:44.243 --> 04:47.037
He just invited me because

04:44.243 --> 04:47.037
I helped him get the part.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.290
Good... because it was your idea

04:47.037 --> 04:50.290
to dismiss the nannies

04:50.290 --> 04:52.042
for this whole

04:50.290 --> 04:52.042
family bonding thing,

04:52.042 --> 04:53.835
so you can't leave me

04:52.042 --> 04:53.835
alone with them.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.378
( baby jabbering )

04:57.089 --> 05:00.425
You know I have to meet my

04:57.089 --> 05:00.425
lawyers, about the plea deal.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.178
NARRATOR:

05:00.425 --> 05:03.178
<i>Ah, yes. You'll recall</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:03.178
<i>Rafael cooked some books</i>

05:03.178 --> 05:04.763
<i>to cover his father's</i>

05:03.178 --> 05:04.763
<i>art theft.</i>

05:04.763 --> 05:06.306
O-Only an hour, you said.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.226
<i>Only it turns out his dad</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:09.226
<i>wasn't really his dad.</i>

05:09.226 --> 05:11.103
And also,

05:09.226 --> 05:11.103
my sister's coming,

05:11.103 --> 05:12.854
so I'll need

05:11.103 --> 05:12.854
some time with her.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.315
<i>To drop the bomb that</i>

05:12.854 --> 05:15.315
<i>she's not really his sister.</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
You done?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.401
<i>Yes, I-I think so.</i>

05:18.401 --> 05:20.195
Yes.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.823
The rest of the time,

05:20.195 --> 05:22.823
I will be here.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.365
MICHAEL:

05:22.823 --> 05:24.365
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

05:24.365 --> 05:26.868
No, because I'm not gonna

05:24.365 --> 05:26.868
make the same mistake

05:26.868 --> 05:28.620
that I made last time.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.620
You mean when Cat told you

05:28.620 --> 05:30.205
not to prepare for

05:28.620 --> 05:30.205
the interview and just,

05:30.205 --> 05:31.832
( falsetto ):

05:30.205 --> 05:31.832
"Fake it till you make it."

05:31.832 --> 05:33.792
Yeah, and this time I'm gonna

05:31.832 --> 05:33.792
prep it till I crush it.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.960
( normal voice ):

05:33.792 --> 05:34.960
My girl.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.087
( laughs )

05:34.960 --> 05:37.087
So, I've been doing

05:37.087 --> 05:39.131
a deep-dive Internet

05:37.087 --> 05:39.131
search on Chloe Leland.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.008
Mm-hmm?

05:39.131 --> 05:41.008
She's incredible.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.384
She published her first book

05:41.008 --> 05:43.384
when she was 19

05:43.384 --> 05:45.137
by tweeting one sentence

05:43.384 --> 05:45.137
at a time.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.221
Yeah, she's basically...

05:46.221 --> 05:47.597
pioneered a whole new form.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.390
You're like the Mark Zuckerberg

05:47.597 --> 05:49.390
of publishing.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.101
( laughing ):

05:49.390 --> 05:51.101
Oh, no, stop.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.519
But feel free to

05:51.101 --> 05:52.519
tweet that about me.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.770
I like it.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.272
And she published,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.272
<i>Around The World</i>

05:55.272 --> 05:57.482
<i>In Eighty Leis:</i>

05:55.272 --> 05:57.482
<i>A Hawaiian Girl Abroad,</i>

05:57.482 --> 05:59.609
which was my favorite book

05:57.482 --> 05:59.609
last summer.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.403
When I read that proposal,

05:59.609 --> 06:02.403
I died.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.405
I had to snap

06:02.403 --> 06:04.405
the minute after.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.033
And she commissioned

06:04.405 --> 06:06.033
a series of books called

06:06.033 --> 06:07.909
<i>Written To the Nines,</i>

06:06.033 --> 06:07.909
which were all written

06:07.909 --> 06:08.994
by kids under ten.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.537
Age ain't nothing but a number.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.371
Says the woman who's

06:10.537 --> 06:12.371
accomplished more before 20

06:12.371 --> 06:13.915
than most people do

06:12.371 --> 06:13.915
in their lifetime.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.125
Ugh, and yet, still single

06:15.125 --> 06:16.251
as my mother reminds me.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.794
Oh, no.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.794
Oh, yes.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.462
How'd she become

06:17.794 --> 06:19.462
a VP so young?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.380
Well, the woman she

06:19.462 --> 06:21.380
replaced found herself

06:21.380 --> 06:23.925
on the wrong side of

06:21.380 --> 06:23.925
a James Frey situation.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.309
Someone had

06:30.682 --> 06:32.309
to take the fall.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.518
NARRATOR:

06:32.309 --> 06:33.518
<i>The cost of being</i>

06:33.518 --> 06:34.728
<i>an unreliable narrator,</i>

06:34.728 --> 06:36.980
<i>which as I've said, I'm not.</i>

06:36.980 --> 06:39.398
<i>Then again,</i>

06:36.980 --> 06:39.398
<i>I'd say that if I were.</i>

06:39.398 --> 06:40.817
I hated getting my big break

06:40.817 --> 06:43.028
at the expense

06:40.817 --> 06:43.028
of another woman's failure,

06:43.028 --> 06:44.612
but this isn't summer camp.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.699
No participation

06:44.612 --> 06:47.699
trophies. Anyway...

06:47.699 --> 06:50.618
I like you enough for phase two,

06:47.699 --> 06:50.618
Jane V.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.204
Sample coverage.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.458
It's a new memoir.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.920
One-page synopsis,

06:57.458 --> 06:59.920
two-page analysis.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.588
I'll give you extra points

06:59.920 --> 07:01.588
if you can do it

07:01.588 --> 07:03.382
without using the letter "E".

07:03.382 --> 07:04.674
Kidding.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.302
( laughs nervously )

07:04.674 --> 07:07.302
XIOMARA:<i> Jane V?</i>

07:07.302 --> 07:09.221
I think it's cute.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.722
Thanks for watching

07:09.221 --> 07:10.722
little man.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.015
Hey, I'm your mom.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.725
If you can't leave

07:12.015 --> 07:13.725
your sick kid here,

07:13.725 --> 07:16.311
and I can't ask for a

07:13.725 --> 07:16.311
really big favor in return,

07:16.311 --> 07:17.520
what do we have?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.022
What's the really

07:17.520 --> 07:19.022
big favor?

07:19.022 --> 07:22.192
Lunch with me, Bruce,

07:19.022 --> 07:22.192
and scary Tess.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.818
Mom, you're an adult.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.237
Teenagers are mean,

07:25.237 --> 07:26.738
and I think that

07:25.237 --> 07:26.738
if you were there,

07:26.738 --> 07:29.074
she would be a little

07:26.738 --> 07:29.074
more self-conscious

07:29.074 --> 07:30.784
about being

07:29.074 --> 07:30.784
a bitch. Please?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.328
Mateo puked on me twice.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.872
Yeah, okay fine.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.872
He did?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.499
Yeah, but then

07:35.872 --> 07:38.499
he seemed okay.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.168
Oh, shoot,

07:38.499 --> 07:40.168
can I have a tampon?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.461
I forgot to go to the store.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.797
Sorry, I don't have my period.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.797
You don't?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.257
Mm-mm.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.257
Aw.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.050
We used to always have

07:45.257 --> 07:47.050
the same cycle.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.843
You aren't gonna cry

07:47.050 --> 07:48.843
because we are not

07:48.843 --> 07:50.637
on our periods

07:48.843 --> 07:50.637
at the same time, are you?

07:50.637 --> 07:51.888
No.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.058
Oh, I think I'm due soon.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.184
Hmm.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.438
Oh, my God.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.106
What?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.690
You're right.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.690
I'm late.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.151
How late?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.944
Like... five days late.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.404
NARRATOR:

08:05.944 --> 08:07.404

08:07.404 --> 08:09.823

08:07.404 --> 08:09.823
<i>all right.</i>

08:14.077 --> 08:16.037
( stammers )

08:14.077 --> 08:16.037
Aren't you on the pill?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.622
Ugh, I skipped

08:16.037 --> 08:17.622
when we were camping,

08:17.622 --> 08:19.291
but that was one day.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.291
NARRATOR:<i> Damn.</i>

08:19.291 --> 08:21.042
<i>These Villanueva women</i>

08:19.291 --> 08:21.042
<i>are fertile.</i>

08:21.042 --> 08:23.003
Mom, I can't have

08:21.042 --> 08:23.003
another baby right now.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.963
Michael's trying to go back

08:23.003 --> 08:24.963
to school. I have to work.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.382
Mateo's so little,

08:24.963 --> 08:27.382
we have a timeline.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.843
Slow down, you haven't

08:27.382 --> 08:29.843
even taken a test.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.887
I've been late once before.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.887
His name... is Mateo.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.222
( Mateo crying )

08:34.222 --> 08:36.016
I'll get him.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.226
Do you have a pregnancy test

08:36.016 --> 08:38.226
laying around by chance?

08:38.226 --> 08:39.769
I think so.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.272
NARRATOR:

08:39.769 --> 08:42.272
<i>Also having severe</i>

08:39.769 --> 08:42.272

What the hell are

08:46.443 --> 08:48.445
you doing here?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.780
You're supposed to be

08:48.445 --> 08:50.780
in the Czech Republic.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.492
And you, I am done with you.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.492
You are fired.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.659
You can't fire me.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.036
Oh, really?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.620
Well, watch me,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.620
you little piece of--

08:56.036 --> 08:57.620
Oh!

Beautiful sister

08:57.620 --> 09:01.082
with the ugly heart,

09:01.082 --> 09:03.210
you don't have the

09:01.082 --> 09:03.210
upper hand anymore.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.585
What the hell is that?

09:04.585 --> 09:07.047
That's the amendment

09:04.585 --> 09:07.047
to Emilio Solano's will.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.216
It's my wedding gift

09:07.047 --> 09:09.216
for my wife,

09:09.216 --> 09:10.550
Mrs. Anezka Archuletta.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
( bells ringing )

09:12.552 --> 09:14.262
You two are m-married?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.596
Yeah, we sure are.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.307
Which means I can

09:15.596 --> 09:17.307
stay in this country.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.643
Oh. Knock yourself out.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.062
The real one's

and hovering above you

09:25.106 --> 09:27.567
all the time in a cloud.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.361
Checkmate, Petra.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.571
You burn me, I burn you.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
The cycle of life.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.742
I can play this game forever.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.785
ANEZKA:

09:35.742 --> 09:37.785
But we don't want to...

09:37.785 --> 09:40.121
do we, my rooster?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.541
( imitates rooster crowing )

09:40.121 --> 09:42.541

What do you want?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.834

it is, what it looks like.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.511
NARRATOR:

09:52.467 --> 09:54.511
<i>Wait, where's Rogelio?</i>

09:55.470 --> 09:56.804
Aren't you gonna say something?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.973
Should I be, like,

09:58.973 --> 10:01.601
real mad right now

09:58.973 --> 10:01.601

10:06.856 --> 10:08.691

10:08.691 --> 10:10.735
She's trying to sell

10:08.691 --> 10:10.735

10:10.735 --> 10:12.612
The more drama, the better.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.951
DARCI:

10:15.740 --> 10:17.951
It would be so much easier

10:17.951 --> 10:20.328
if you would play the part

10:17.951 --> 10:20.328
of my boyfriend.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.205
You know I can't do that.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.124
Not even for the sizzle?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.251
(<i> Latin theme playing</i> )

10:29.504 --> 10:32.257
Come on, can't you see it?

10:32.257 --> 10:35.510
You and me, shrink-wrapped

<i>I'd watch it.</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:45.686
Look, I have

10:43.893 --> 10:45.686
to limit my exposure

10:45.686 --> 10:47.897
to serious acting roles.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.149
Perhaps I'll embrace reality

10:49.149 --> 10:51.025
on the other side

10:49.149 --> 10:51.025
of my career comet,

10:51.025 --> 10:53.320
with a comeback

10:51.025 --> 10:53.320
on<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>

10:53.320 --> 10:55.489
(<i> upbeat dance theme playing</i> )

10:57.031 --> 10:58.908

But would you come

10:58.908 --> 11:02.120
to my screening with me, Darci?

11:02.120 --> 11:05.624
I would love to walk the

11:02.120 --> 11:05.624

11:05.624 --> 11:08.251
There's a red carpet for

a friends and family screening?

11:08.251 --> 11:10.670
The metaphorical red carpet.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.840
I wouldn't miss it.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.097
Almost as cute as you.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.974
But not quite.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.101
Someone's feeling better,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.101
aren't you?

11:25.101 --> 11:28.146
We are gonna put

11:25.101 --> 11:28.146
all these photos on the wall,

11:28.146 --> 11:30.524
so we can look around

11:28.146 --> 11:30.524
and see our family.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.732
Would you like that?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.235
Yeah? Yeah?

Oh, oh!

11:36.904 --> 11:39.616
Oh, yes. That's a good one.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.700
We went to the carnival,

11:41.700 --> 11:43.203
and Michael

was so nervous that night

11:43.203 --> 11:44.703

everything Mommy does now?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.839
What do you think?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.342
Are you ready for a sibling?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.802
Hmm?

11:59.802 --> 12:02.597
( inhales, exhales )

12:02.597 --> 12:04.558
( door closes )

12:04.558 --> 12:06.017
Guess who just destroyed

12:06.017 --> 12:09.437
two multiple choice

12:06.017 --> 12:09.437
practice sections in a row.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.147
Oh, yeah?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.694
Are you cooking?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.694
( chuckles )

12:15.694 --> 12:17.237
What'd you do with my wife?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.738
It's just pasta.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.283
( laughs ) I wanted to do

12:19.738 --> 12:22.283
something nice for you.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.826
But instead you cooked?

12:25.328 --> 12:26.954
Are you trying

12:25.328 --> 12:26.954
to take advantage of me?

12:26.954 --> 12:29.082
Please let

12:26.954 --> 12:29.082
the answer be yes.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.668
Oh, is this the manuscript

12:29.082 --> 12:31.668
you have to read? How is it?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
Oh, it's good.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.670
Yeah, it's all about

12:33.670 --> 12:35.088
this girl's crazy childhood

12:35.088 --> 12:36.964
in Fort Pierce.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.964
Oh, yeah?

12:36.964 --> 12:38.841
As crazy as the drug bust

12:36.964 --> 12:38.841
I worked there last year

12:38.841 --> 12:39.967
with the Coast Guard?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.469
Maybe I should write a memoir.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.766
Okay, I have a practice

12:44.847 --> 12:47.766
question for you.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.311
If an 18-month-old

12:47.766 --> 12:50.311
child's mother

12:50.311 --> 12:52.439
is five days late

12:50.311 --> 12:52.439
for her period...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.524
Uh-huh.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.524
and she and her husband

12:54.524 --> 12:57.151
have a timeline

12:54.524 --> 12:57.151
that includes...

12:57.151 --> 12:59.195
( sighs )

12:59.195 --> 13:02.449
I don't know what comes next

12:59.195 --> 13:02.449
in this question.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.784
I'm trying to tell you

13:02.449 --> 13:05.784
that we might be pregnant.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.704
What?

13:07.704 --> 13:10.998
I'm late. My mom gave me a test,

13:07.704 --> 13:10.998
I-I haven't taken it yet,

13:10.998 --> 13:12.250
I wanted to wait for you.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.627
Really?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.044
You're excited?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.087
You're not?

13:16.087 --> 13:17.547
I-I went straight

13:16.087 --> 13:17.547
to stress.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.091
With school, and money.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.593
Okay.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.720
Okay, first,

13:21.593 --> 13:23.720
l-let's take the test.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.265
Is this a... a plus,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.265
or a lightning bolt?

13:27.265 --> 13:28.433
It's nothing.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.850
My mom's test was expired.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.144
I'll have to buy one tomorrow.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.605
NARRATOR:

13:31.144 --> 13:33.605
<i>Oh. Kind of a letdown.</i>

13:33.605 --> 13:35.898
So, you'd be excited?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.652
I mean, it's sooner

13:35.898 --> 13:38.652
than we thought,

13:38.652 --> 13:42.280
but our family already started

13:38.652 --> 13:42.280
earlier than we planned.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.574
That's true.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.367
What?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.289
I'm just thinking

13:48.995 --> 13:51.289
about a little baby Michael.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.207
Or a little baby Jane.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.207
( laughs )

13:54.626 --> 13:56.835
And only two and a half

13:54.626 --> 13:56.835
years younger than Mateo,

13:56.835 --> 13:59.297
which is kind of ideal

13:56.835 --> 13:59.297
distance for siblings.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.007
Mm-hmm.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.343
NARRATOR:

14:01.007 --> 14:03.343
<i>And speaking of siblings...</i>

14:03.343 --> 14:07.180
So I'm not actually

14:03.343 --> 14:07.180
your brother, biologically.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.808
<i>Ah yes, look who's back.</i>

14:13.060 --> 14:16.105
And I understand

14:13.060 --> 14:16.105
if this changes things for you.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.775
Raf, stop.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.486
You're my brother.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.822
A blood test

14:21.486 --> 14:23.822
doesn't change that.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.032
I love you.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.743
And I will

14:26.032 --> 14:28.743
always have your back.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.704
Just like

14:28.743 --> 14:30.704
you've always had mine.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.580
NARRATOR:

14:30.704 --> 14:32.580
<i>Aw, see?</i>

14:32.580 --> 14:35.625
<i>This is the kind of sibling</i>

14:32.580 --> 14:35.625
<i>love Jane was talking about.</i>

14:35.625 --> 14:37.502
Thank you.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.630
I think this is the perfect time

14:37.502 --> 14:40.630
for you to come.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.173
NARRATOR:

14:40.630 --> 14:42.173
<i>Oh, no.</i>

14:42.173 --> 14:43.466
<i>Who is she talking to?</i>

14:43.466 --> 14:47.011
No one. I'm telling you,

14:43.466 --> 14:47.011
no one is here.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.138
Not even the paps

14:47.011 --> 14:49.138
know who I am.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.724
It's humiliating.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.100
And I'm the one

14:50.724 --> 14:53.100
who called them with the hot tip

14:53.100 --> 14:55.186
that celebs would be here.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.648
You are a brilliant

14:55.186 --> 14:58.648
actor, Rogelio.

14:58.648 --> 15:03.403
Trust me, everyone in America

14:58.648 --> 15:03.403
will know your name very soon.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.112
NARRATOR:

15:03.403 --> 15:05.112
<i>And actually, friends,</i>

15:05.112 --> 15:07.240
<i>this would turn out to be true.</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:09.950
WOMAN ( on screen ):

15:07.240 --> 15:09.950
<i>Then I upped his meds,</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:09.950
<i>doubled the dose.</i>

15:09.950 --> 15:11.703
( harsh whisper ):

15:09.950 --> 15:11.703
Now! Now!

15:11.703 --> 15:13.954
ROGELIO'S CHARACTER:

15:11.703 --> 15:13.954
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

15:13.954 --> 15:17.542
<i>I don't want to feel anymore.</i>

15:17.542 --> 15:20.044
WOMAN:

15:17.542 --> 15:20.044
<i>Several patients</i>

15:17.542 --> 15:20.044
<i>have had side effects.</i>

15:20.044 --> 15:21.128
<i>We could have class action suit</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:22.338
<i>on our hands...</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:22.338
Wait, what?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.381
Shh.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.716
Where's the rest

15:23.381 --> 15:24.716
of the scene?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.259
I mean,

15:24.716 --> 15:26.259
they cut my penis.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.428
Oh, my God,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.680
they cut my penis!

15:30.680 --> 15:32.223
Why would

15:30.680 --> 15:32.223
you do that?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.516
You can't just cut away

15:33.516 --> 15:35.852
right in the middle of my...

15:38.772 --> 15:42.525
Calm down, please.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.525
I will not calm down!

15:42.525 --> 15:44.611
They never would have

15:42.525 --> 15:44.611
done that to Brad Pitt.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.030
And I never would have taken

15:44.611 --> 15:48.030
a role in this indie hack movie

15:48.030 --> 15:50.408
if I'd known they were

15:48.030 --> 15:50.408
going to humiliate me

15:50.408 --> 15:52.452
by not showing my penis.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.912
DARCI:

15:52.452 --> 15:53.912
Would you stop saying that?

15:53.912 --> 15:54.871
Why should I?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.497
The movie's boring, and slow

15:56.497 --> 15:58.917
and it had one

15:56.497 --> 15:58.917
thing going for it:

15:58.917 --> 16:00.710
my provocative penis.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.922
Penis! Penis,

16:00.710 --> 16:03.922
penis, penis!

16:03.922 --> 16:06.800
I might as well say it, because

16:03.922 --> 16:06.800
no one's ever gonna see it!

16:06.800 --> 16:09.343
I get you're upset.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.929
But you're still in the movie.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.639
In a forgettable part.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.808
It'll be okay.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.808
No, it won't!

16:14.808 --> 16:17.268
And you wouldn't understand

16:14.808 --> 16:17.268
because you just want

16:17.268 --> 16:18.603
to be Bethenny Frankel.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.648
But I want to be

16:18.603 --> 16:21.648
taken seriously.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.859
Well.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.445
I didn't get a glimpse

16:24.859 --> 16:27.445
of your penis tonight,

16:27.445 --> 16:29.489
but I did see a big dick.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.994
MICHAEL:

16:33.033 --> 16:34.994
<i>At least</i>

16:33.033 --> 16:34.994
<i>you didn't have to see it.</i>

16:34.994 --> 16:36.496
Yeah, I know.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.833
What's wrong?

16:41.751 --> 16:43.085
I got my period.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.880
Oh.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.257
So. No baby.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.467
Gotcha.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.760
Okay.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.889
Well, maybe it was for the best,

16:54.889 --> 16:56.140
with me in school...

16:56.140 --> 16:58.726
Yeah. And my work stuff

16:56.140 --> 16:58.726
in the air.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.896
I guess I just started to

16:58.726 --> 17:01.896
get excited about the idea.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.315
It's okay.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.317
We have plenty of time.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.569
Okay?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.196
ANEZKA:

17:08.569 --> 17:10.196
<i>Give us a smile.</i>

17:10.196 --> 17:12.198
NARRATOR:

17:10.196 --> 17:12.198
<i>Aw, look.</i>

17:12.198 --> 17:14.158
<i>Petra's babies</i>

17:12.198 --> 17:14.158
<i>are warming up...</i>

17:14.158 --> 17:16.035
( crying )

17:14.158 --> 17:16.035
<i>to Anezka.</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:17.286
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

17:17.286 --> 17:19.330
Oh, I just missed them

17:17.286 --> 17:19.330
so much.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.916
And they missed

17:19.330 --> 17:21.916
their Auntie Anezka. Hmm?

17:21.916 --> 17:23.376
( chuckles )

17:23.376 --> 17:25.628
Thank you for letting me

17:23.376 --> 17:25.628
see them.

17:25.628 --> 17:28.631
I didn't have much of a choice,

17:25.628 --> 17:28.631
once you blackmailed me.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.550
That is something I'd be wanting

17:28.631 --> 17:30.550
to be moving on

17:30.550 --> 17:32.426
from talking about.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.426
( crying continues )

17:32.426 --> 17:33.636
( whispers ):

17:32.426 --> 17:33.636
Here.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.306
Come. Let me try.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.810
Please. She's hungry.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.402
( crying stops )

17:49.402 --> 17:51.487
( crying )

17:52.446 --> 17:53.823
Don't worry.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.823
I'm sure

17:53.823 --> 17:55.825
they will be warming up

17:53.823 --> 17:55.825
to you eventually.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.495
( gasps )

17:58.077 --> 17:59.495
No?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.080
Mm...

18:02.373 --> 18:04.124
RAFAEL:

18:02.373 --> 18:04.124
I just passed Anezka

18:04.124 --> 18:06.126
in the hallway. What the hell

18:04.124 --> 18:06.126
is she doing here?

18:06.126 --> 18:09.797
( sighs )

18:06.126 --> 18:09.797
She just wants to spend

18:06.126 --> 18:09.797
some time with the twins.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.675
Look, she's blackmailing us,

18:09.797 --> 18:12.675
what was I supposed to do?

18:12.675 --> 18:16.554
If I probate the will, they

18:12.675 --> 18:16.554
won't be able to blackmail us.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.890
No. No, you promised

18:16.554 --> 18:18.890
you wouldn't do that.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.099
Raf, please.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.142
Let me give my kids

18:20.099 --> 18:22.142
what I never had--

18:22.142 --> 18:23.728
financial stability.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.232
NARRATOR:

18:25.312 --> 18:28.232
<i>Ah, the things we do</i>

18:25.312 --> 18:28.232
<i>for our kids.</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:31.652
<i>And... our moms.</i>

18:34.864 --> 18:37.116
So, Tess.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.868
What do you like

18:37.116 --> 18:38.868
to do for fun?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.870
( phone chimes )

18:40.870 --> 18:42.580
Hey. No, um, phones

18:40.870 --> 18:42.580
at the table.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.499
Of course. Sorry,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.499
I didn't mean to be rude.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.585
NARRATOR:

18:45.499 --> 18:47.585
<i>Ah, yes. Teenspeak.</i>

And the pepper.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.357
Cute wallpaper.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.280
It's nice you're so loyal

19:13.820 --> 19:16.280
to your family.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.784
Yeah, we're really close,

19:19.784 --> 19:21.661

19:24.330 --> 19:26.415
Oh, my dad said

19:24.330 --> 19:26.415
you lived at home.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.251
I used to, but my husband

19:26.415 --> 19:29.251
and I live in Wynwood now.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
I told you, she moved...

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
I don't listen that much to you.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.132
That's actually

19:32.546 --> 19:34.132
a really cool area.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.758
Yeah. We love it.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.678
Uh, the apartment's small,

19:35.758 --> 19:38.678
but we live, like, three blocks

19:38.678 --> 19:40.763
from the Panther coffee shop

19:38.678 --> 19:40.763
on the corner of Sycamore.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.432
Seriously? I go there

19:40.763 --> 19:43.432
with my friends all the time.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.976
Their mocha lattes

19:43.432 --> 19:44.976

19:53.901 --> 19:55.361
<i>Also bonding?</i>

19:55.361 --> 19:57.864
So sorry I'm late,

19:55.361 --> 19:57.864
I had to put the twins down.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.615
Oh, no problem.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.826
No, no, no. I am under

19:59.615 --> 20:01.826
strict instructions

20:01.826 --> 20:04.829
not to let you touch anything

20:01.826 --> 20:04.829
that might be contagious.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.206
Uh, I have

20:04.829 --> 20:07.206
the big test, so...

20:07.206 --> 20:08.290
Yeah.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.250
So cool, man.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.128
What you're doing.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.713
It's really impressive.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.589
Oh, thank you.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.589
I appreciate that.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.757
JANE:

20:15.589 --> 20:16.757
Hey.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.425
Found Mr. Monkey.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.425
( gasps )

20:18.425 --> 20:19.719
Good-bye, Mr. Sweetface.

You're copying Daddy,

20:23.806 --> 20:26.308
aren't you?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.644
He's copying everything

20:26.308 --> 20:28.644
these days. Everything.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.647
You want to be just

20:28.644 --> 20:31.647
like Daddy, don't you?

20:31.647 --> 20:33.399
( laughing ):

20:31.647 --> 20:33.399
Yeah!

20:35.902 --> 20:38.029
Okay. Back to the books for me.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.364
Uh, speaking of books,

20:38.029 --> 20:40.364
do you think it's weird

20:40.364 --> 20:42.867
that Chloe never responded

20:40.364 --> 20:42.867
about my coverage?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.577
Probably just hasn't

20:42.867 --> 20:44.577
read it yet.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.953
Yeah.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.953
( knocking on door )

20:45.953 --> 20:48.247
Oh. They must have

20:45.953 --> 20:48.247
forgotten something.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.208
( sighs )

20:50.208 --> 20:52.085
Jane!

20:52.085 --> 20:54.003
I found your house!

20:52.085 --> 20:54.003
( laughs )

20:54.003 --> 20:55.379
What are you doing here?

20:55.379 --> 20:58.257
It took me a couple of tries,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.257
but whoo-hoo!

20:58.257 --> 21:00.426
P.S., your neighbors are mean.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.802
Are you drunk?

21:01.802 --> 21:04.138
I'm just a little bit

21:01.802 --> 21:04.138
completely trashed.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.140
Don't tell my dad. Shh.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.059
I can crash here, right?

21:08.059 --> 21:09.643
Um...

21:14.982 --> 21:16.275
She won't let me take

21:14.982 --> 21:16.275
her to Bruce's.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
You can't tell my dad.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
Please!

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
Okay.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.528
I'll be nice to you,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.528
I swear.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.528
Just sit down.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.614
You can have sex

21:19.528 --> 21:21.614
with him all the time.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.074
We'll get you some water.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.118
And maybe some pizza?

21:27.203 --> 21:28.996
I have to call

21:27.203 --> 21:28.996
Bruce, right?

21:27.203 --> 21:28.996
<i>Si.</i>

21:28.996 --> 21:31.040
Definitely. Just give her

21:28.996 --> 21:31.040
a little time to sober up.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.332
Okay, I don't want

21:31.040 --> 21:32.332
to mess this up.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.626
This feels like

21:32.332 --> 21:33.626

Ma, she's gone.

She can't get far

21:49.642 --> 21:51.477

21:51.477 --> 21:53.062
My bike is missing.

Enough, I get it, Barry.

Which is kind of responsible.

to apologize,

24:17.915 --> 24:19.166
What you need, my friend,

24:19.166 --> 24:21.085
is a big gesture

24:19.166 --> 24:21.085
to win her back.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.795
When I was winning over Jane,

24:22.795 --> 24:26.048
I karaoked, I whittled

24:22.795 --> 24:26.048
her a giraffe.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.967

think of something

24:36.100 --> 24:37.810
that's just the right size.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.020

24:59.497 --> 25:01.125
I didn't.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.170
I actually dropped off

25:50.090 --> 25:52.385
