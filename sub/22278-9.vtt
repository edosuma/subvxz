00:06.600 --> 00:09.033
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:09.067 --> 00:11.667
it's make it or break it
in the Arctic.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.967
This place will kill you
deader than dead.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.967
NARRATOR: A final trial
could end a rookie's life
in the bush.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
CODY:
I'm kind of afraid right now
that I might find out

00:19.033 --> 00:20.667
that this is something
I don't wanna do.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.133
NARRATOR: A Hailstone
family lesson backfires.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.967
CHIP: Are you all right?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.300
NARRATOR:
And Sue cuts a road home
across the icy tundra.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.633
This is not good. Shit!

00:56.567 --> 00:57.767
SUE: Yay.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.600
I am so excited for today.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.267
Obviously if you look around
this is not Kavik.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.500
Um, I am in Deadhorse

01:05.533 --> 01:09.467
and it's a little industrial
town, my closest town.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.200
It's about 80 miles or so
away from me to the west.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.600
I'm here because I've got
some new equipment.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.533
I ordered up and had
specifically made an Argo.

01:19.567 --> 01:20.633
It's an eight-wheeled

01:20.667 --> 01:21.833
all-terrain vehicle
with tracks

01:21.867 --> 01:24.700
so that I can have
a mode of transportation.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.767
Living here,
I have a lot of
freedom of soul,

01:27.800 --> 01:29.400
and now I want
freedom of body.

01:29.433 --> 01:30.733
It's time to rock and roll.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.767
The Argo really
is a unique rig

01:43.800 --> 01:46.667
specifically designed for
these kinds of conditions.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.233
It's an all-year-round
vehicle.

01:48.267 --> 01:51.300
I'm gonna put it through
one of the hardest tests
it's ever gonna have.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.833
The only way to get this
vehicle, it's too big
to fit in an aeroplane,

01:53.867 --> 01:56.267
so the only way I can get it
is to drive it over land.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.867
And this is the virgin run
for this piece of equipment,

01:59.900 --> 02:01.600
so I am a little nervous
about that.

02:01.633 --> 02:06.533
NARRATOR: To reach Kavik,
Sue will tread across nearly
80 miles of the tundra's snow,

02:06.567 --> 02:08.700
rock, and river ice.

02:08.733 --> 02:12.600
Losing her way in the
vast Arctic wilderness
could mean disaster.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.467
If you go up this way then
you'll only have

02:14.500 --> 02:16.900
three major river crossings.

02:16.933 --> 02:18.700
Although you do cross
the Sag twice.

02:18.733 --> 02:19.833
You got to cross
the Sag twice.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.467
Bob is a bush pilot
friend of mine,

02:21.500 --> 02:23.833
and he's not only watching
my dog, Ermie,

02:23.867 --> 02:27.000
while I'm gone, but he's gonna
help me out

02:27.033 --> 02:28.933
kinda mapping
the journey to Kavik.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.000
Sprinkled throughout
this whole area

02:32.567 --> 02:34.233
there's quite a few bear dens.

02:34.267 --> 02:35.800
Yeah, that's another concern.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.600
Especially as I make this turn

02:37.633 --> 02:40.133
I know there's one out here.

02:40.167 --> 02:42.767
From Deadhorse to Kavik
in winter

02:42.800 --> 02:45.900
it's roughly 80, 85 miles
over land

02:45.933 --> 02:48.133
and I'll be in the rig
for about two days.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.733
There's a lot of things,
a lot of things could
go wrong.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.300
Am I afraid of the journey?

02:54.333 --> 02:56.233
No, but I am concerned.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
ANDY: The quickest way to
learn what your needs are
is to go out,

03:02.033 --> 03:03.567
spend a winter
out in the bush

03:03.600 --> 03:04.867
in Alaska by yourself,

03:06.433 --> 03:09.300
and you will learn really
quick what your needs are

03:09.333 --> 03:11.233
or are not in your life.

03:18.967 --> 03:21.700
I'm gonna forget something.
I know it. (EXHALES)

03:21.733 --> 03:23.167
NARRATOR:
Cody has come to Alaska

03:23.200 --> 03:26.500
to learn the ways
of survival in the bush.

03:26.533 --> 03:29.333
Today, Andy will give him
his final test.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.200
Sleep well?

03:34.233 --> 03:37.067
Always,
I got a clear conscience.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.133
How about you?

03:39.167 --> 03:41.533
-It's kind of hard
not to out here.
-(CHUCKLES)

03:41.567 --> 03:42.700
You've been here
quite a while,

03:42.733 --> 03:43.833
you picked up a lot of skills.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.133
You're doing a great job.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.500
What I want you to do now

03:46.533 --> 03:49.067
is I want you
to put together an outfit

03:49.100 --> 03:51.133
and go spend some time out
in the bush alone.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.367
Okay?

03:52.400 --> 03:57.300
Cody came out to us earlier
this winter and his goal is to

03:57.333 --> 03:59.467
learn some basic bush skills.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.300
He's got a lot of drive.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.700
He's showing
a lot of potential.

04:03.733 --> 04:07.067
But a big part of living out
in this wilderness environment

04:07.100 --> 04:08.767
is you
got to be comfortable
with yourself

04:08.800 --> 04:11.933
'cause there's a lot
of periods of time when you're
going to be alone.

04:11.967 --> 04:14.533
If you can't be comfortable
with yourself out here,

04:14.567 --> 04:16.800
you're probably
not gonna stay for too long.

04:16.833 --> 04:20.900
So what we're gonna do
is he's gonna go out into
the woods and set up a camp

04:20.933 --> 04:24.333
and basically do it all
on his own.

04:24.367 --> 04:27.767
Make sure
that you think about
what is it you need?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.000
If you don't spend time alone,

04:29.033 --> 04:31.167
you really don't understand
yourself very well

04:31.200 --> 04:32.667
and you really don't
know what your needs are.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.867
So this is gonna be your
opportunity to get out
into the woods,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.067
spend some time alone,
and just see
if you like it or not.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.267
-Survival slash meditation?
-Yeah.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.133
We're gonna find out
real quick

04:43.167 --> 04:47.167
how he handles
fear of the unknown.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.300
Alrighty. (SIGHS)

04:49.333 --> 04:51.300
ANDY: It'll be
a good experience.
It'll be fun.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.400
CODY: Oh, yeah,
I'm looking forward to it.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.067
(LAUGHS)

04:57.267 --> 04:58.333
(DOGS BARKING)

04:58.367 --> 05:00.067
ANDY: All right, come on.
Let's go.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.367
Attaboys.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.733
Go, go!
Little haw, little haw!

05:06.767 --> 05:12.167
CODY: I came out here to live
what I consider my dream.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.400
I don't ever want to go back
to a 9 to 5 job.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.467
I don't ever wanna have to
deal with a boss

05:16.500 --> 05:18.067
breathing down your neck.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.733
But I actually am
kind of afraid right now that
I'm gonna go out there

05:21.767 --> 05:25.000
and go through this
whole experience
and not be able to make it.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.867
I try not to think about
stuff that's gonna scare me.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.000
I try not to let fear
get a hold of me at all.

05:32.033 --> 05:36.000
But there's this notion
in the back of my head that

05:36.033 --> 05:37.733
I don't want to find out
that this is something

05:37.767 --> 05:38.833
I don't want to do.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.700
ANDY: Little haw.

05:41.667 --> 05:42.733
Attaboy.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.033
Good job.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.500
Good boys!

05:46.967 --> 05:49.933
Yay, good dogs.

05:49.967 --> 05:54.133
We're gonna set your camp up
right here on this little
peninsula here, okay?

05:54.167 --> 05:56.233
Things are gonna come up
that we haven't done.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.733
Just take a minute or two,
think about it, try it.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.633
Okay?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.733
-So you good?
-I feel pretty comfortable.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.233
Okay.

06:04.267 --> 06:05.333
Tighten up. Hup-hup.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.333
Good boy.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.367
CODY: And there was one.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.500
GLENN: Most of what
goes through

06:16.533 --> 06:17.900
people's consciousness today

06:17.933 --> 06:21.167
is a representation
of something else.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.167
Out here, it's direct.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.633
You're experiencing reality.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.467
Here in the Arctic
fire is essential.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.100
If I don't have a fire
I couldn't live long out here.

06:37.133 --> 06:38.800
And my preferred way
to make it

06:38.833 --> 06:41.367
is with a friction
fire set like this.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.867
The nearest place I can get
matches is 200 miles away
from here.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.933
I don't wanna rely on matches
because fire's so essential.

06:47.967 --> 06:51.400
I want to be able to light
a fire with what I can get
right here in this valley.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.567
Here is the set
that I build a fire with.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.200
The thing is some components
of the set wear out.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.867
This spindle, for example,

06:58.833 --> 07:01.367
I make it about this long
to start

07:01.400 --> 07:05.000
and each time I build a fire,
a little bit more wears off
the end.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.367
It gets shorter and shorter.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.167
I need to get a new spindle.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.667
I need to get a new fireboard.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.900
New string.

07:10.933 --> 07:13.367
Plus I need to get material
to build a nest

07:13.400 --> 07:17.633
that is where I cradle
the ember after
I get the ember.

07:17.667 --> 07:20.033
And then I'm gonna
blow it into a flame.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.233
First thing I need to do
is make the string.

07:22.267 --> 07:26.933
This is the hide of a caribou
that I shot here
and that I ate.

07:26.967 --> 07:30.133
And now
I'm gonna use its hide
to make a string.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.767
I'm just gonna make
a straight cut.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.000
Now obviously I got to get
all this hair off.

07:40.567 --> 07:44.033
This is an example of
the type of jobs

07:44.067 --> 07:45.767
that require patience.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.600
Not just pulling this hair out
but to build this whole set.

07:48.633 --> 07:52.000
You know, everything doesn't
come fast and easy out here.

07:52.033 --> 07:53.867
You just take your time.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.033
Be patient.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.467
Stuff will happen.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.000
Awesome.

07:59.033 --> 08:00.767
I got it.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.633
Got it de-haired, twisted.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.900
I think it'll work.

08:05.867 --> 08:08.433
CHIP: A lot of kids think
their parents just go out
at 8:00 in the morning

08:08.467 --> 08:09.767
and come back at 5:00.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.233
Not so with our kids.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.967
They know exactly
what we're doing when we walk
out the door.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.533
AGNES: Wow, it's going to be
an awesome day.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.033
The sun is already shining.

08:27.067 --> 08:30.067
I'm gonna get ready
and go out, Carol.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.633
I just need that gutting hook.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.133
CHIP: Carol has an extremely
intelligent personality.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.867
She picks up on anything.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.133
She's very creative.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.400
And fortunately for her,
you know,

08:39.433 --> 08:40.633
with the way that people

08:40.667 --> 08:42.400
teach people around here
is for them to observe

08:42.433 --> 08:44.167
and then to put hands on.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.533
Well, she had to come to
a certain amount of strength
and a certain height.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.367
And, you know, just a certain
physical being

08:48.400 --> 08:49.700
before she can drive
a snow machine,

08:49.733 --> 08:52.033
before she can compress
the spring on a trap.

08:52.067 --> 08:55.400
And now that she's old enough
and large enough to do that,
I got her traps.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.067
And I want to go set,
show her how to use them.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.600
And if Carol ever has a hard
economic time,

08:59.633 --> 09:01.200
you know, if things aren't
going so good,

09:01.233 --> 09:02.467
she can always set a trap,

09:02.500 --> 09:06.233
get a fox,
sew a fox into a hat,
and get 250 bucks.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.500
Or get a hat out of the deal.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.667
And it's gonna show her
how to provide for herself.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.800
And we want her to thrive.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.400
Not just live.
Not just get by.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.033
We want her to really
enjoy living.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.700
-Carol, come.
-Coming, Momma.

09:21.533 --> 09:22.600
CHIP: I have traps.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.900
These babies are going to
camp with us.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.600
I'm gonna go put in

09:27.633 --> 09:30.400
a whole new trap line
if there's something worth
getting down that way.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.567
-You're good to go, Agnes?
-AGNES: Ready and willing.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.533
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
will travel 26 miles

09:38.567 --> 09:40.767
from their home
to Camp Kookoochaiq,

09:40.800 --> 09:45.900
the same place Carol's family
has been trapping fur as
a way of life for generations.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.300
CHIP: We live in the Arctic,
which is a rather
harsh environment,

09:48.333 --> 09:51.967
and fur isn't just a luxury
here, a lot of times
it's a necessity.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.400
Because fur has qualities
that artificial
materials don't.

09:55.433 --> 09:56.967
But this place will kill you
deader than dead

09:57.000 --> 09:58.467
and if you don't get them
down to basics

09:58.500 --> 10:00.133
it's pretty tough to learn
later in life.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.267
AGNES: Oh, boy.

10:06.833 --> 10:07.867
We're here.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.967
The cabin still stands.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.467
Home sweet home.

10:15.467 --> 10:16.567
CHIP: This is Kookoochaiq.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.967
My wife, and her dad,
and her oldest brother Alvere

10:20.000 --> 10:23.233
built this place about
maybe 22, 23, 24 years ago.

10:25.733 --> 10:26.967
Well, for the next few days

10:27.000 --> 10:28.700
we're gonna be basing
ourselves out of here

10:28.733 --> 10:31.000
and seeing what kind of fur
animals we can come up with.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.700
We need some fur for sewing
and to teach the children.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.533
And we need some fur,
the same stuff will make us
some money.

10:36.567 --> 10:39.167
And I wanna teach her
and give her experience.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.333
Ready?

10:44.033 --> 10:46.400
This is excellent weather
to be setting traps in.

10:46.433 --> 10:47.933
It's clear skies.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.467
We don't have snow falling
down on us.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.833
It's cold enough that
the animals are out,
and they're looking for food,

10:51.867 --> 10:53.067
but we're able to operate
right here

10:53.100 --> 10:54.533
out of the cabin and save gas

10:54.567 --> 10:56.067
and stay in the trapping area

10:56.100 --> 10:58.900
without having to travel back
and forth to Noorvik so much.

10:58.933 --> 11:01.800
I'm gonna make a really
obvious trap.

11:01.833 --> 11:05.633
We put it out here
in the middle of the river and
let the animals come to it.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.900
'Cause we have our fish camp
right here

11:08.933 --> 11:11.767
and the smell of salmon
and people isn't so spooky
to the animals.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.767
I think they'll have
no problem trying
to wrestle off

11:13.800 --> 11:15.400
a piece of the fish
that I've got.

11:15.433 --> 11:17.567
And they'll walk up to it,
and they'll sniff it,
and see it,

11:17.600 --> 11:19.300
and wonder
what it's all about.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.633
And that will be that.

11:20.667 --> 11:21.933
Put the safety on there.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.033
CAROL: It is.
CHIP: It won't get you.

11:25.867 --> 11:27.033
CAROL:
Okay, a little bit more.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.667
CHIP: You got to do
a better job than that.
Is it up?

11:32.367 --> 11:34.500
-Okay there, it's on.
-Thank you, dear.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.433
(GRUNTS)

11:37.067 --> 11:38.233
It can't go any more.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.100
Okay.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.633
AGNES: Hopefully by the time
we wake up

11:42.667 --> 11:44.400
there will be something here.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.967
CHIP: This will work out good.
We just need a fox
to come along.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.867
Let's go put one more
over here next to the bushes.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.000
Okay, bun. Come over here.
I'm gonna need your hands.

11:52.567 --> 11:53.700
Can I step right here?

11:53.733 --> 11:55.067
CHIP: Yeah, you can step
anywhere you want.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.567
'Cause you got to put the
safety on for me.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.167
I can't do this.

12:00.967 --> 12:02.100
I'm gonna try
one more time.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.667
Fuck. These things are
eating my hands up.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.367
It gets pretty tough having
the strength to compress
this fucker,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.767
and hold it while someone's
trying to put the safety on.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.133
God damn it.
Are you all right?

12:20.933 --> 12:22.167
Fuck. I'm sorry, bun.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.333
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.000
You gonna be okay?

12:30.067 --> 12:31.333
Last thing I want to do
is hurt you.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.700
I understand. I felt it go
right out of my hand.

12:34.733 --> 12:35.967
Look.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.733
See my hand right there?
Same thing.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.933
You wanna just
call this good?

12:45.033 --> 12:47.000
Let's call it good
with that, okay?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.900
Trapping is inherently
dangerous, you know?

12:49.933 --> 12:51.267
I mean, you don't
want to get trapped.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.800
But more than that

12:52.833 --> 12:54.800
it's something that we
want to teach her

12:54.833 --> 12:55.967
and we want her to enjoy it.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.767
Because if you're not enjoying
what you're being taught

12:57.800 --> 12:59.567
you generally
don't stick with it.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.133
I want her to stick with it,

13:01.167 --> 13:02.933
so no matter what I'm not
gonna make an issue
out of anything

13:02.967 --> 13:04.933
that we do when it comes
to trapping with her.

13:04.967 --> 13:07.333
I wasn't trying to whack you,
but look at me.

13:07.367 --> 13:11.533
When it's that dangerous
and we're not in control,
we don't set the trap.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.700
That make sense to you?

13:13.733 --> 13:17.733
Bun, what I want you to learn
is that sometimes you can just
say you don't have to do this.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.067
Okay?

13:19.100 --> 13:21.033
That big trap,
we don't have to do that.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.800
It's okay when things
don't work out.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.900
I want my daughter to know
when it's time to walk away.

13:24.933 --> 13:28.000
Part of living out here
is knowing when to quit
or when to stay home.

13:28.033 --> 13:32.467
Or knowing when to stay
on shore or when to stay
off the ice.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.733
There's a lot of things you do
that you learn that
you don't do. (CHUCKLES)

13:36.767 --> 13:37.867
It's all good.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.067
We'll set those
traps tomorrow.

13:42.133 --> 13:47.133
ANDY: Being self-reliant
gives you a sense of security
that you can't buy.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.600
Very few people ever really
experience that,

13:49.633 --> 13:51.500
and I kind of feel sorry
for people

13:51.533 --> 13:52.833
if they don't experience that.

14:05.267 --> 14:07.800
CODY:
Andy gave me a little bit of
a surprise this morning

14:07.833 --> 14:10.867
and told me I'd be going
on a little survival trip.

14:10.900 --> 14:16.033
With all the information
Andy's given me, he's using
it as a final test here.

14:16.067 --> 14:19.067
Put me out in the middle of
nowhere and see how I do.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.433
It's a little bit freaky.
A little bit scary.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.600
But anybody who's not
a little bit scared is a fool.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.467
There goes our sunlight.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.067
I got a lot of shit to do.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.167
Main thing right now
is to get this sucker up
in a tent,

14:31.200 --> 14:34.733
get myself some shelter
before it gets dark.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.033
And there goes that.

14:42.067 --> 14:44.633
There's some things I heard
about Andy before
I came out here

14:44.667 --> 14:48.467
and after getting to know him
and learning from him,

14:48.500 --> 14:52.933
when he yells
there's no mistaking
what he said.

14:52.967 --> 14:56.267
There ain't no asking
"Huh?" or "What?" with him.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.967
He gets the message across
straight and clear.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.067
And when it comes to him
teaching

15:02.100 --> 15:04.567
he really doesn't leave
too many questions.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.600
Like there's
a lot of things I do

15:06.633 --> 15:10.133
where, you know,
I'm questioning myself,
questioning what I need to do.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.800
How to do this,
how to do that.

15:11.833 --> 15:15.067
But he's been out here
so long and

15:15.100 --> 15:16.633
he's so passionate about
what he does,

15:16.667 --> 15:17.767
he wants it to come across

15:17.800 --> 15:20.200
to whoever he's
teaching it to.

15:20.233 --> 15:23.167
And anytime he's taught me
a lesson

15:23.200 --> 15:24.933
it stuck pretty damn well,
I'll say that.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.467
And it's done.

15:32.700 --> 15:36.333
SUE: You must live in the here
and now to do what I'm doing.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.367
If you got one foot in
yesterday and one foot
in tomorrow

15:38.400 --> 15:39.833
the only place
you don't have a foot

15:39.867 --> 15:41.267
and a grasp on is today.

15:47.933 --> 15:48.933
(ENGINE STARTING)

15:50.100 --> 15:51.867
Last little check.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.400
Everything's on.
Everything's good.

15:54.433 --> 15:59.133
NARRATOR: Sue's voyage home
will take her across nearly
80 miles of brutal tundra.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.400
She hopes to reach
Kavik in 48 hours.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.867
All right.

16:02.900 --> 16:03.900
Here we go.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
My version of going to town,
that was all fun,
that was really cool,

16:11.033 --> 16:13.367
you know,
I got to have a hot shower.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.633
But I don't get bushy
in the wild,
but I do get town flu.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.367
I need to...
I need to get home.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.800
Yeah. So this is it.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.000
Bye-bye, Deadhorse.
Hello, Kavik.

16:28.833 --> 16:35.667
There's about 70 to 100 miles
of wilderness between me
and there.

16:35.700 --> 16:41.100
The map is head towards
that sundog out there.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.600
About 70 miles later
I should be in Kavik.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.367
You know, this journey,

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
it's kind of like if anybody's
ever been curious

16:56.433 --> 16:59.133
about what would it be like
to be on the moon.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.267
This would probably be
pretty freaking close.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.967
Everything's white.
Everything.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.300
Your sky is white,
your snow is white,
your hills are white.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.300
It's all variations on white.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.967
Your depth perception
is difficult,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.600
because I just physically
can't tell where
the hills are,

17:14.633 --> 17:15.933
it's all the same colour.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.400
You know, we're...
I'm just starting to go

17:18.433 --> 17:22.233
from my ambient light
back to darkness.

17:22.267 --> 17:24.000
It's about 3:00
in the afternoon.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.333
It is very difficult to tell
where's your horizon at?

17:26.367 --> 17:27.433
Where's the sky?

17:27.467 --> 17:29.133
Where is the land?

17:29.167 --> 17:31.733
So my visibility is starting
to become an issue

17:31.767 --> 17:34.233
and I'm just gonna have
to slow it down a little bit.

17:37.567 --> 17:43.900
Um... I am headed towards
a 1951 helicopter wreck.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.700
It's sort of a halfway
point for my journey.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.967
Got the coordinates,

17:49.067 --> 17:50.600
so I'm trying to make it there

17:50.633 --> 17:53.167
and then I'll just camp out
for the night.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.033
Check the pressure
on the tyres,

17:55.067 --> 17:57.300
get some fuel in,

17:57.333 --> 18:00.600
and make a little tent camp,
make a little dinner,

18:01.167 --> 18:02.733
and get some rest.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.500
Then finish up the journey
tomorrow.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.133
What was that?
What was that?

18:11.233 --> 18:12.733
Uh-oh.
Good God, what was that?

18:13.733 --> 18:15.500
Ruh-roh.
We got a problem, Scooby.

18:17.267 --> 18:18.533
Yeah, I've got squealing.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.000
Fuck.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.233
(SQUEALING)

18:25.267 --> 18:28.133
Something's squealing.
That's for damn sure.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.100
NARRATOR: A troubling noise
forces Sue to stop

18:30.133 --> 18:32.400
and inspect her new vehicle.

18:32.433 --> 18:36.833
With temperatures plummeting
and darkness looming,
time is crucial.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.567
It's cold out here.

18:38.600 --> 18:44.567
My guess with the temperature,
clear skies,
it's dropping like a stone.

18:44.600 --> 18:50.033
I've probably got at least 35,
40 below zero right now
on my skin.

18:50.067 --> 18:55.233
I've got a problem with
the rig and I've still
got 35, 40 miles to go.

18:56.567 --> 18:59.233
I'm a lot of miles
from anything.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.000
The satellite service
doesn't even work.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.667
I can't call for help.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.467
I've got to get out
and fix it.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.867
With the wind chill right now
it's a nasty mother

19:06.900 --> 19:08.633
to try and fix something,
tear it apart.

19:13.533 --> 19:16.667
Moving this belt, I mean,
it looks like it's in
the right groove.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.767
Nothing looks off track.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.400
It is one of these two
that's doing it.

19:22.433 --> 19:23.867
Start it up, see what happens.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.933
There was a bunch of ice
on there.

19:26.967 --> 19:28.967
If I keep going forward
maybe that will help.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.533
With something
going wrong here,
I don't want to risk it.

19:32.567 --> 19:36.333
My life, I've got kids
and grandkids
and I need to be in one piece.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.967
So if I shut it down,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.567
I'm not so positive
if it's gonna start up again.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.133
I'm gonna give it a whirl.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.033
I'm gonna see if it'll...
I'm gonna see if it'll hold.

19:47.433 --> 19:48.733
Come on, little red.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.933
-Stop your whining,
you're a Kavik girl now.
-(SQUEALING CONTINUES)

19:52.967 --> 19:57.000
You know, you're this lone
little light in the middle
of the tundra.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.767
Yeah, it's not like
I can call AAA.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.700
CHIP: If you can't thrive
in the environment
you live in

20:04.733 --> 20:06.533
and you become dependent
on other people,

20:06.567 --> 20:10.000
you're dependent and that's
the wrong way to be.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.100
These are brand new.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.533
When they are brand new
they are tough.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.833
(CLICKS)

20:23.867 --> 20:26.100
-AGNES: Whoo!
Are you all right?
-I did that on purpose.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.367
No, I flipped it on top of it.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.933
Okay.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.733
NARRATOR:
The Hailstones are teaching
their daughter Carol

20:31.767 --> 20:34.167
how to trap fur
in the Arctic.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.567
But despite a close call
last night, the lesson
must continue today.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.067
I'm just trying to show Carol

20:40.100 --> 20:42.367
what it is activities
on a trap line are.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.300
Now she's got her own traps
and she's also large enough

20:45.333 --> 20:46.867
and old enough to participate.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.800
She's got to be careful
when setting traps.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.700
God damn it!
Are you all right?

20:54.433 --> 20:56.633
I wouldn't say
she got bucked off the horse.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.867
You get
bucked off the horse

20:57.900 --> 20:59.267
when your hand's
stuck in the trap.

21:00.267 --> 21:01.833
That's getting knocked off
the horse.

21:01.867 --> 21:04.000
But she found out the horse
can kick.

21:07.033 --> 21:10.567
Let's stop at that first
slough across from those
cabins and set one there.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.667
CAROL: Yup.

21:20.167 --> 21:23.233
There's a fox or something.
No, over there.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.633
CHIP: This is pretty good.

21:26.733 --> 21:27.800
I'm gonna set something here.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.000
Maybe we just get a fox.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.167
Watch how he does that.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.233
-Dad.
-CHIP: I'm gonna
set this trap.

21:35.267 --> 21:36.900
Carol, I'm gonna show you
something really important.

21:36.933 --> 21:38.833
So I want you to really
pay attention.

21:38.867 --> 21:41.267
-You gotta have respect
for the traps.
-CAROL: Mmm-hmm.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.533
-You see how the safeties
are faced down?
-Yep.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.833
So they don't unhook
accidental like.

21:44.867 --> 21:46.400
-Okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

21:46.433 --> 21:49.067
AGNES: Carol's pretty tough.
She's tougher than most
I'd say.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.700
I'm glad she didn't chicken
out or be afraid of the traps

21:52.733 --> 21:56.800
seeing how she hurt herself
last night trying to set them.

21:57.633 --> 21:58.833
She's a good one.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.033
CAROL: This is interesting.

22:00.067 --> 22:01.767
This is a hollow space
underneath here.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.033
I could see that.

22:03.067 --> 22:06.000
And I'm gonna place that trap,
'cause you have a nice crust.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.700
I could hollow this out
real nice

22:07.733 --> 22:10.100
and nothing's gonna interfere
with the trap at all.

22:10.133 --> 22:12.000
Then something comes along
and steps on this.

22:12.033 --> 22:13.233
And here's
the dangerous part again.

22:13.267 --> 22:14.400
You got to pay attention.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.767
The safeties are on now
'cause they're under tension,

22:16.800 --> 22:19.733
but once we spread them
and the tension comes off

22:19.767 --> 22:22.033
they're dangerous
all over again.

22:22.067 --> 22:24.067
I want her to see that death
is occurring.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.400
These animals are being
caught, and trapped, killed,

22:27.433 --> 22:29.000
and then where that
comes from.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.167
And it's a more complete
education for the child.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.367
Not only that,
it ties her in

22:32.400 --> 22:33.833
with her greater
Inupiaq values

22:33.867 --> 22:36.267
and her greater Eskimo family,

22:36.300 --> 22:40.100
because everybody here
is one big, huge family.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.500
Pretty hard to beat
that in school.

22:42.533 --> 22:46.900
GLENN: Time, numbers,
measurement, temperature.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.567
I mean,
who gives a fuck really?

22:50.133 --> 22:51.667
It's how it feels.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.367
It's not the number
that matters.

22:56.933 --> 22:58.900
I got my string all built.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.467
What I need now
is some dry grass

23:00.500 --> 23:02.600
and the right piece of poplar.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.733
And with that I should be able
to build a fire

23:04.767 --> 23:07.300
entirely with materials that
I gather right here,

23:07.333 --> 23:08.900
within a mile of my home.

23:08.933 --> 23:11.433
NARRATOR: Living a primitive
life in the Brooks Range,

23:11.467 --> 23:13.767
Glenn cannot
survive without fire.

23:16.267 --> 23:19.167
GLENN: I need to look around
for some grass that I can
use for tinder for the nest.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.900
And that takes a lot of work
to find in these conditions

23:21.933 --> 23:23.533
'cause everything's
covered in snow.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.033
I'll probably end up walking
a couple of miles.

23:25.067 --> 23:27.067
I don't really know where
I'm gonna find it exactly.

23:30.933 --> 23:33.033
That's what I'm looking for.

23:33.067 --> 23:36.067
Nice, big grass leaves.

23:37.533 --> 23:41.100
I have to be really careful
not to get the grass wet.

23:41.133 --> 23:44.200
It's pretty warm out,
12 degrees above zero.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.833
So if I get any snow

23:45.867 --> 23:48.767
on my hands
or in my pocket,

23:48.800 --> 23:52.533
it starts melting right away
and the grass will get wet.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.900
And that is bad.

23:59.233 --> 24:02.700
Almost all the trees in this
valley are white spruce.

24:02.733 --> 24:08.333
But the type I'm looking for,
a balsam poplar,
is a very different tree.

24:08.367 --> 24:12.433
And I know an area where
there's a little grove of
poplar trees.

24:14.033 --> 24:19.733
Having spent a lot
of my time out here for
the last 10 years,

24:19.767 --> 24:22.567
I'm pretty familiar with
the forest all around
the valley.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.400
So I keep special spots
like this in mind.

24:26.433 --> 24:29.700
Anywhere there's a resource
that I might need
in the future.

24:29.733 --> 24:33.667
I lock that away when I see it
and then I can get back to
what I need when I want it.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.433
Rather than cutting a standing
tree I might be able to find

24:38.467 --> 24:39.600
a good piece of wood

24:39.633 --> 24:41.500
on the ground from a tree
that fell over.

24:41.533 --> 24:44.133
I can see
where some poplar trees
here have died

24:44.167 --> 24:46.167
and fallen over underneath
the snow.

24:54.933 --> 24:56.800
(THUD)

24:56.833 --> 24:58.500
There, that's a piece of wood
right there.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.567
This is the piece I want.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.400
This section in here.

25:06.433 --> 25:09.600
'Cause inside this piece of
wood there's a fireboard
and a spindle.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.267
I just haven't found it yet.

25:15.533 --> 25:17.067
There.

25:17.100 --> 25:22.500
I just split off a piece
that I think will work pretty
good for the board.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.133
You know how I feel out here?

25:28.167 --> 25:30.133
Meditative. (CHUCKLES)

25:30.167 --> 25:33.333
It's just a meditation
working on all these things.

25:33.367 --> 25:37.267
Whether it's taking that hair
out of that caribou, or just
whittling away at this.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.133
It's just a very
meditative activity.

25:39.967 --> 25:42.133
So, I've got my spindle.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.967
I'm gonna try and build a fire
and cook some dinner
right here.

25:50.933 --> 25:54.667
I'm just taking some of the
grass and breaking it up.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.433
Go right in the middle where
the ember's gonna go.

25:58.467 --> 25:59.600
I'm getting hungry.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.567
(EXHALES) I've got an ember.

26:19.567 --> 26:25.767
It's just so beautiful to see
that first ember when I'm
drilling away like that.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.200
It's all dark, and then you
see this little orange glow,

26:29.233 --> 26:31.000
but you don't want to stop
too soon.

26:31.033 --> 26:33.267
You just keep going until you
can't hold your breath
any more

26:33.300 --> 26:35.500
'cause all the smoke's
rolling up.

26:35.533 --> 26:38.967
You have to stop breathing
at some point, and
you just keep on trucking.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.933
There's just something special
about these tools.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.700
They just feel great.

26:43.733 --> 26:48.067
I mean, just to think that
you can just take a tree
that's laying under the snow,

26:48.100 --> 26:50.500
and you can make
a fire out of it.

26:50.533 --> 26:55.733
For a second, I almost thought
it was gonna go out
once I had the ember.

26:55.767 --> 26:58.067
I even had some flame
and then it started to go out.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.733
It's really fragile
in the beginning.

27:00.767 --> 27:03.433
You just have to coax it
into life.

27:03.467 --> 27:04.967
Now, it's going strong.

27:09.933 --> 27:11.767
Here's some moose meat
I brought.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.800
I'm just gonna boil it
right in this pot.

27:16.767 --> 27:21.233
For thousands and thousands
of years, people have been
building fires this way.

27:21.267 --> 27:22.900
They just stopped
doing that recently.

27:23.867 --> 27:25.167
Most of the time people
have been on earth,

27:25.200 --> 27:27.167
this is how they've been
building fires, you know.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.400
I live this way
because I enjoy it.

27:31.433 --> 27:36.400
I could be laying in a hammock
on the beach in Thailand
if I wanted to be,

27:37.533 --> 27:40.533
but, no, I just have
a lot of fun up here.

27:43.933 --> 27:45.300
CHIP: If you don't know
what the ice is like,

27:45.333 --> 27:47.067
if you don't know
when to stay home,

27:47.100 --> 27:50.267
if you don't know, you know,
what's the appropriate time
to go do things,

27:50.300 --> 27:52.400
you're not gonna do well
at all.

27:52.433 --> 27:54.200
A lot of people up here
just disappear.

NARRATOR: After setting
a number of traps
in the wilderness

28:03.400 --> 28:04.567
that surrounds camp,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.867
it's time for the next phase
of Carol Hailstone's

28:06.900 --> 28:08.167
trapping lesson.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.367
Checking for fur.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.133
(CHIP SPEAKING)

28:17.267 --> 28:18.333
CAROL: Yeah.

28:18.367 --> 28:19.500
(CHIP SPEAKING)

28:19.533 --> 28:20.533
Let's go.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.400
CAROL: You could.

28:24.867 --> 28:26.300
CHIP: Nothing in this
trap here.

28:34.100 --> 28:37.500
I hope you're not frustrated
over not catching anything
in this,

28:37.533 --> 28:40.467
but just setting the traps
overnight doesn't usually

28:40.500 --> 28:42.733
produce on the very
first night.

28:42.767 --> 28:46.167
What happens is the animals
go around for like
three days

28:46.200 --> 28:48.000
before they come back to
where they started.

28:50.567 --> 28:53.433
We'll leave this one
right here, and I can
come back and set it again.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.233
CAROL: Those were
the last ones, huh?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.533
CHIP: One more to go.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.233
(ENGINE STARTING)

29:12.833 --> 29:15.600
I want her not only to
be able to make it out living.

29:15.633 --> 29:17.533
I also want her to know
how to make a living.

29:17.567 --> 29:21.967
I want her to see and know
how to process the animal
from beginning to end.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.333
Because it doesn't just appear
like out of the store,

29:24.367 --> 29:26.200
we bought this
and then put it together.

29:26.233 --> 29:28.967
They've got to know
the origins of everything
that they're putting together.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.467
Where they get them,
how to get them.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.133
And it's a more
complete education.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.867
Oh, look, Dad!

29:46.500 --> 29:47.500
(CHIP LAUGHS)

29:49.000 --> 29:50.200
CHIP: Excellent.

29:50.233 --> 29:51.500
AGNES: Right on!

29:52.033 --> 29:53.567
Last trap even.

29:54.567 --> 29:57.167
Wow, is there something in it?

29:57.200 --> 29:58.767
CHIP: Yeah.
Tell me what it is though.

30:00.667 --> 30:02.433
(CAROL SPEAKING)

30:02.467 --> 30:04.400
CHIP: Yup. Sure is.

30:04.433 --> 30:08.133
Looks like he got the
piece of salmon off,
and did himself in.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.400
Well, we were towards the end
of our line here,

30:10.433 --> 30:13.800
and, you know,
we got lucky with a lynx.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.300
What can I say?

30:15.333 --> 30:18.733
But this guy was just
in the wrong place
at the wrong time for himself.

30:18.767 --> 30:21.000
For us, it was the right place
at the right time.

30:21.033 --> 30:23.467
CAROL: Oh, it's a lynx.
CHIP: You see what I mean
by killer trap?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.100
Look at that.
He didn't have a chance.

30:25.133 --> 30:27.233
That broke his neck
right away.

30:27.267 --> 30:29.600
Since this is your first one,
maybe you'll clean
the skin up

30:29.633 --> 30:31.267
and give it away
to somebody
who will sew it.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.367
(CAROL SPEAKING)

30:32.400 --> 30:33.900
CHIP: To Stephanie?
There you go.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.333
Being my daughter's first
catch of a lynx,

30:36.367 --> 30:38.200
traditionally among
themselves,

30:38.233 --> 30:42.067
these Inupiaq learn to be
providers, and the best way
to teach them to be providing

30:42.100 --> 30:43.833
is to teach them
to give it away.

30:43.867 --> 30:47.067
So, one of the best lessons
here is that my daughter's
gonna take the skin

30:47.100 --> 30:48.333
from the trap that
she helped me set,

30:48.367 --> 30:50.033
and she's gonna
give it away.

30:50.067 --> 30:54.767
She'll learn that something
so valuable shall be passed on
to someone else.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.867
-Well, it's getting late.
Let's get this home, huh?
-AGNES: Yeah.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.433
CHIP: We'll go
show your sisters.

30:58.467 --> 31:01.100
We'll thaw it out in the front
room for a day or two,

31:01.133 --> 31:03.067
and you can tell them
all about it.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.133
AGNES: I'm so happy
for you, Carol. Yee!

31:06.167 --> 31:09.000
CHIP: We've been working
on this for years,
and as she's growing up,

31:09.033 --> 31:11.900
we keep showing her
the next step, and the next
step, and the next step.

31:11.933 --> 31:15.500
And right now
she's accomplished catching
an animal in the trap.

31:15.533 --> 31:18.933
We've got a little more
to go to, but I would say this
has been an excellent lesson

31:18.967 --> 31:20.733
with an excellent reward
for that lesson.

31:20.767 --> 31:22.800
-You guys are ready?
-AGNES: Yup. We're ready.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
Yee!

31:35.300 --> 31:36.933
ANDY: It's your philosophy
of living.

31:36.967 --> 31:39.467
A lot of it depends on
what your skills are.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.333
If you have a lot of
skill sets,

31:42.733 --> 31:44.300
you can live with less

31:44.333 --> 31:46.567
of the outside world
in your world.

31:56.267 --> 31:59.567
CODY: I'd say today I woke up
in one of those moods where

31:59.600 --> 32:01.400
I really didn't feel
like getting out of bed.

32:01.433 --> 32:02.867
A little bit beat down today.

32:02.900 --> 32:03.967
I guess I just don't feel

32:04.000 --> 32:05.900
the same way I would
back home.

32:05.933 --> 32:08.333
I mean, I want to share
this experience.

32:08.367 --> 32:13.367
I want to share everything
about this, and not having
somebody there to talk to,

32:13.400 --> 32:15.167
not having that right now...

32:17.667 --> 32:18.667
It's hard.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.333
Time to go get some water
for the dogs.

32:24.700 --> 32:26.733
I got a list of
important things out here.

32:26.767 --> 32:30.100
Water, fire, shelter.
Pretty damn important to me.

32:30.133 --> 32:32.867
Without water, I can't make
my own food, soup,

32:32.900 --> 32:34.733
anything I want
to make in there.

32:34.767 --> 32:38.900
Without water, I can't feed
my dogs, can't give them the
proper nutrition they need,

32:38.933 --> 32:40.833
and they ain't gonna do
too good out here
in that case.

32:46.967 --> 32:49.867
There's two good options
for water out here,

32:49.900 --> 32:54.567
and I can either go and take
10 trips scooping out snow
out of the ground

32:54.600 --> 32:56.400
where you're getting
about half a bucket.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.567
Every 22 inches of snow
equals one inch of water.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.967
So you can imagine the work
you gotta put in for that.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.467
Or if I just spend
five minutes cutting hard
with an axe,

33:05.500 --> 33:07.767
get a bunch of chunks of ice,
I can get a full bucket
of water

33:07.800 --> 33:09.500
out of a full bucket of ice
for the most part.

33:12.867 --> 33:17.600
Since we've had this crazy
wind going on, all the snow on
the lake got blown off,

33:17.633 --> 33:20.900
and it made it real nice
and easy for me to come out
here and take a good crack

33:20.933 --> 33:22.633
to take some chunks off of it.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.567
I haven't had one good thing
come of this wind until
this morning,

33:25.600 --> 33:27.567
and coming out and
seeing this lake uncovered.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.300
So, you know, for every down
there's an up.
For every up there's a down.

33:31.333 --> 33:34.367
You just gotta try and make
the best of it, and do what
you can do

33:34.400 --> 33:36.467
to keep on keeping on
out here.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.700
Anybody thirsty?

33:41.733 --> 33:44.267
Main thing I gotta do is
come out and care for
these dogs.

33:44.300 --> 33:48.500
You know, it gets lonely
out in the lake by yourself,
and knowing they're there

33:48.533 --> 33:51.633
kind of perks the spirits up
a little bit when you're
getting down.

33:51.667 --> 33:54.333
Having to feed them,
water them,

33:54.367 --> 33:58.333
it definitely takes a lot of
work but in the long run, it's
well worth it to have them.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.033
SUE: I like challenge.

34:03.067 --> 34:05.200
I like the unknown.

34:05.233 --> 34:08.267
What's gonna come at me?
What's the next challenge
gonna be?

34:08.300 --> 34:09.333
I don't know.

34:09.367 --> 34:12.233
I don't know what I can
or can't do.

34:23.933 --> 34:25.933
Oh, my God.
What a beautiful day.

34:27.733 --> 34:31.100
I ran all night last night
and got a little cold.

34:31.133 --> 34:33.467
I mean, I got my little
sleepy cover, but...

34:33.500 --> 34:38.400
Man, that squealing on the
belt, that wasn't good, but
it's not doing it any more.

34:38.433 --> 34:41.433
So whatever it is,
is beyond me
and behind me.

34:41.467 --> 34:43.567
I've got my bearings. Um...

34:44.700 --> 34:45.867
Home is there.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.267
(ENGINE STARTING)

34:57.633 --> 35:03.033
Well, I'm coming up to one of
my last major river crossings,

35:03.067 --> 35:07.200
and been trying to find a way
around it, and there is none.

35:07.233 --> 35:10.067
I've got open water up ahead.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.600
Lots of it.

35:11.633 --> 35:13.300
And it's just overflow,

35:13.333 --> 35:14.933
meaning the pressure

35:14.967 --> 35:16.367
of the running
water underneath

35:16.400 --> 35:17.567
all the ice is a lot,

35:17.600 --> 35:19.933
you just have water
on top of ice.

35:19.967 --> 35:22.167
But there could be a hole,

35:22.200 --> 35:24.133
and I don't see
a way around it.

35:24.167 --> 35:26.233
I just gotta go through.
I mean, that's all.

35:26.267 --> 35:27.667
I live on the other side.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.367
I don't have a choice.
I gotta do it.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.700
Oh, man. Shit.

35:32.467 --> 35:33.800
Yeah. I mean, I'm seeing...

35:39.333 --> 35:43.200
I mean, I'm seeing channels
of shiny water.

35:43.233 --> 35:46.767
The sun's angled.
I can't tell if there's holes.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.867
Getting stuck would just
wreak havoc on my plan.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.400
So, getting stuck is
not an option.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.833
A little nerve wracking
here, guys.

35:56.933 --> 36:00.600
This is not cool.
Wet is dead out here.

36:00.633 --> 36:02.367
Whoa. Son of a gun!

36:06.467 --> 36:09.433
I just gotta keep going,
and hang onto my panties.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.367
(CHUCKLES) Shit! I got water.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.867
This is not good.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.900
What I'm afraid of
is my tracks spinning
on the ice in the water.

36:23.967 --> 36:26.100
There was a hole there, man.

36:26.133 --> 36:27.300
This is not cool.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.367
Oh, shit!
It's getting deep there.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.267
Shit! Oh, shit.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.400
I sunk through,
there was a hole there, man.

36:40.967 --> 36:42.033
This is not cool.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.433
The edge is in sight.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.767
Oh, I'm almost there.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.467
Shit!

37:03.733 --> 37:05.967
I think I messed my panties.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.033
(SIGHS)

37:08.067 --> 37:10.233
A lot of relief right now.
Um...

37:10.900 --> 37:12.767
It's... It's scary.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.900
You know, I mean,
I'm big, bad Sue,
but you know,

37:15.933 --> 37:19.067
I do want to make it
to my next adventure, so...

37:20.367 --> 37:22.100
I faced my fear.

37:22.133 --> 37:25.233
I was acting like a little
girl about it a while ago
in case I ran into it.

37:25.267 --> 37:28.667
I ran into it, thankfully,
in the daytime,
not the night,

37:31.267 --> 37:33.300
but upward and onward.
Back to exploring.

37:34.067 --> 37:35.367
Good job, little red.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.567
Coming in for a landing
on my own runway.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.433
Made it home. Yay!

38:12.633 --> 38:14.000
Hey, buddy!

38:14.733 --> 38:16.200
Are you here to see Mom?

38:17.567 --> 38:19.400
(LIPS SMACKING) What is it?

38:20.833 --> 38:22.933
Has I gots a new vehicle?
Come on!

38:23.600 --> 38:24.900
It's me!

38:25.633 --> 38:26.900
Yeah. It's Momma.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.500
What is this?

38:29.533 --> 38:32.133
Is that our new rig?
Come on.

38:32.167 --> 38:33.433
(LIPS SMACKING)

38:33.467 --> 38:36.500
(WHISTLES) Nice to have
a welcoming committee
when you get home.

38:36.533 --> 38:40.067
It's been two days
of travelling.
Five hours today.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.233
Oh. The odometer says
a little over 80 miles,

38:45.733 --> 38:49.100
and lights are on,
foxes are happy, I'm home.

38:49.133 --> 38:51.400
You know, the whole point
of this journey,

38:51.433 --> 38:53.133
two days, doesn't matter
what I went through.

38:53.167 --> 38:58.000
I got here, and for me,
that was the whole point.

38:58.033 --> 39:01.500
So, that's like the one
small step for mankind,

39:01.533 --> 39:04.200
one giant freaking leap
for Suzy.

39:04.233 --> 39:07.567
I mean, that was
a one two-day trip,
but it's the first.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.700
Many more to follow.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.467
Home sweet home.

39:13.233 --> 39:16.600
ANDY:
Big part of living out here
is your mental aptitude.

39:16.633 --> 39:19.833
If you're the kind of person
that thrives on being alone,

39:19.867 --> 39:22.133
being alone
can be a real blessing.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.200
(BARKING)

39:30.233 --> 39:31.600
CODY: You're ready to go home,
aren't you?

39:33.567 --> 39:37.333
Today, I decided it's time to
pack it up and head back.

39:37.367 --> 39:40.900
Right now I feel like I got
a good amount of energy
to get back safely.

39:40.933 --> 39:43.100
I'm pretty happy
with how I did.

39:43.133 --> 39:46.167
I was able to make it through
on my own out here.

39:46.200 --> 39:50.500
Got a lot of time to myself,
and kind of proved
to myself that

39:50.533 --> 39:53.433
if I can do this out here
somewhat comfortably,
I could probably go

39:53.467 --> 39:56.333
a damn good amount of time
on my own out here.

39:56.367 --> 40:00.467
I'm gonna pack it up,
get out of this wind,
and get back to Kate and Andy,

40:00.500 --> 40:02.000
and hopefully,
they'll be proud.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.900
-(BARKING)
-You guys ready?
Let's go home!

40:14.833 --> 40:15.967
Gee! Gee!

40:16.000 --> 40:17.767
Gee! Gee!

40:20.100 --> 40:22.933
Yay, Topaz!

40:22.967 --> 40:27.133
All right! Come here, Tope.
Come here.

40:27.167 --> 40:29.067
I'll help you unharness here,

40:29.100 --> 40:31.967
and then we can chat about
how everything went.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.067
Okay.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.900
Did you have any moments,

40:34.933 --> 40:36.200
like, there has
to be something.

40:36.233 --> 40:38.833
Nobody goes out into the
wilderness for the first time,

40:38.867 --> 40:41.633
and not have
even a bad day.

40:41.667 --> 40:46.067
Well, it was I think
yesterday morning where

40:46.100 --> 40:49.800
I didn't wanna get out of bed.
I didn't really want
to do anything.

40:49.833 --> 40:54.133
Just feeling the utter
vastness of the country,
and having no one around.

40:54.167 --> 40:58.500
I almost packed it up and
called it quits, but started
putting that lonely feeling

40:58.533 --> 41:00.133
towards the back of my head.

41:00.167 --> 41:03.967
Kind of perked up
a little bit, and was able
to keep on going.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.800
You've been learning
a lot of different skills.

41:06.933 --> 41:11.200
Setting up the camp,
building fire,

41:11.233 --> 41:16.067
how to set up a trap line,
how to find water,
make water out here,

41:16.100 --> 41:18.600
how to take care of your dogs.

41:18.633 --> 41:22.200
Those are all the fundamentals
and the basics
for living out here.

41:22.233 --> 41:24.400
I think you did a pretty
darn good job of it.

41:24.433 --> 41:27.067
You should feel proud of
yourself, and I see some

41:27.100 --> 41:30.500
confidence in your walk
and your step, and
that's the key to all this.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.333
You gotta build
that confidence.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.100
The more you do,
the better you get at it.

41:34.133 --> 41:35.767
So, hey, good job, man.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.400
Is that the Calico seal
of approval?

41:37.433 --> 41:39.033
(KATE AND ANDY LAUGH)

41:39.067 --> 41:41.333
I may not be your mom,
but I think she'd want me
to give you this.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.200
Oh.

41:43.233 --> 41:45.600
That meant a whole lot
to me right there.

41:47.867 --> 41:52.433
Andy's kind of a man
of few words,

41:52.467 --> 41:57.400
and for him to basically give
me a handshake and say
"Good job".

41:59.800 --> 42:02.867
I feel alive, and damn proud
to be where I am right now.

42:07.333 --> 42:10.500
ANDY: Cody came into our
world about the same age

42:10.533 --> 42:13.133
that I came into
the wilderness in Alaska here.

42:13.167 --> 42:18.000
I think what he's done for me
is kind of help me remember
a lot of the excitement,

42:18.033 --> 42:20.767
the newness,
some of the fears.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.867
I hope he at least spends
a year or two out doing this.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.500
'Cause I think he'll really
learn a lot personally
from it.

42:27.533 --> 42:29.367
All right, buddy.
There's your plane.

42:29.933 --> 42:31.700
(LAUGHS)

42:31.733 --> 42:35.667
I think that was one of the
greatest adventure/educational
times of my life right there.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.967
Alaska's a very, very
rough place,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.300
but I've gained so much
respect for myself out here

42:41.333 --> 42:44.533
that I didn't know I had,
and gained so much
confidence in myself out here.

42:46.267 --> 42:49.500
I've been touched in many ways
by the dogs,

42:49.533 --> 42:51.567
and the landscape,
and the beauty,

42:52.967 --> 42:54.000
and having to
leave this place

42:54.033 --> 42:56.100
is one of the hardest things
I've ever done.

42:56.133 --> 42:58.867
But I'm leaving with the
mindset that I will be back.

42:58.900 --> 43:01.067
With the amount of information
and knowledge Andy's given me,

43:01.100 --> 43:03.400
I feel it's time for me to go
find my own piece of heaven.
