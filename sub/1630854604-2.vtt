00:02.460 --> 00:04.546
<i>- Previously on</i>
<i>"Below Deck Adventure"...</i>

00:05.755 --> 00:06.965
- So we have Rick,
his wife Sarah,

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
celebrating their
40th birthday.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.385
- Cheers.
- The guests request to

00:10.427 --> 00:11.678
go hiking and caving.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.847
- Our job is to give
the guests the adventure

00:13.888 --> 00:15.181
of their lifetime.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.183
- [vomiting]
- You all right?

00:17.225 --> 00:18.351
- I just threw up,
like, everywhere.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.352
<i>- All crew, all crew--</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:21.187
Oriana's
not feeling very well.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.023
- So I'm a stew down.
- Cheers to Norway.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.357
- Love you guys.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.359
- Their drinking stamina
is just to a level

00:26.401 --> 00:28.361
that I haven't
actually seen before.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.280
We haven't even got
hardly any beers left.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.531
Not bloody ideal.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.908
- My first boat I
worked with Oriana.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.368
She was my chief stew.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.456
- Kasie is not someone who
likes to be told what to do.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.082
- I don't really respect her.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.293
- What about--
what about a flower?

00:43.335 --> 00:45.211
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Oriana's hot.</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:46.880
I'm a single Pringle.
[chuckles]

00:46.921 --> 00:47.922
- You worked on yachts before?

00:47.964 --> 00:49.424
- No, this will
be my first yacht.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.884
- So you're a yacht greenie.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.969
- I'd hoped to be the kind
of leader that people like

00:53.011 --> 00:54.304
and keep everyone happy.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.184
- You just had to ask.
- I usually set my own rules

00:59.225 --> 01:00.435
because I'm a cowboy.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.395
I mean, I've got it
right here, cowboy.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.606
<i>- Hold all fenders until</i>
<i>we've cleared the port.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:05.732
[horn blares]

01:05.774 --> 01:07.192
- The captain said
you've blocked

01:07.233 --> 01:09.277
his view with the
fender during departure.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.862
- This is the face of
a guy who gives a (BLEEP).

01:10.904 --> 01:12.405
- Getting cold,
this needs to go out.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.948
- Why haven't they come?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.992
<i>- We are ready for service.</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:17.744
We've been calling
you for service for a while.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.454
- Timing is a sh-- show.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.539
- Whatever Jess is doing,
just tell her to keep doing it.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.665
- Aw.
[smoke alarm blaring]

01:22.707 --> 01:23.792
- Oh, my God.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.126
- Whoo.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.424
- So, Kyle, regardless if
he says he knows it already,

01:31.466 --> 01:33.426
you tell him at all.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.552
- You know how to
read that, right?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.096
Yes or no?
You know how to read that?

01:36.137 --> 01:37.722
- I heard you.

01:40.141 --> 01:43.061
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>* *</i>

01:58.159 --> 02:00.078
<i>* *</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.621
- So we're just
doing the--that

02:01.663 --> 02:04.124
and lines with the anchor
every hour, or every two hours?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.458
- Yeah, every hour.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.503
I'm gonna show you
exactly what he wanted.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.880
I'm sure you know
where we are right here.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.007
- I know all this.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.508
Just cut straight to what
you want to say.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.427
Get through it as
fast as possible, bro.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.429
- All right, man, take it easy.
I'm gonna get there.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.264
- Bro, 'cause you're just
saying a bunch of sh--.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.432
- Nah, I ain't saying
a bunch of sh--.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.933
Don't just rush me, you know?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.643
I gotta take my time, so I
can make sure I get it right.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.769
- Yeah, a lot of people
don't learn that way.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.312
- Make sure to watch
me when I do this,

02:26.354 --> 02:27.647
because this is what you want
me to do, all right, buddy?

02:27.689 --> 02:28.940
- Mate, this is like
my thousandth time.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.066
- I know, man.
I know.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.276
And I'm just doing my job.
You know?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.819
- It's cool.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.822
<i>- I know Kyle has a little</i>
<i>more experience than me.</i>

02:35.864 --> 02:37.949
But, dude, you don't
have to be like a dick

02:37.991 --> 02:39.200
or nothing like that.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.243
You know how to
read that, right?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.703
Yes or no, that's all I want.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.663
Yes or no?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.707
If Kyle ----s up, I
don't want him to be like,

02:45.749 --> 02:47.208
"Oh, Nathan didn't tell me
that."

02:47.250 --> 02:50.545
I'm telling him every single
thing, so do your damn job.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.213
You know how to read that?
- I heard you.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.761
- Yeah, bro, I heard you.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.220
[sighs]

03:02.265 --> 03:03.350
<i>* *</i>

03:03.391 --> 03:05.643
[smoke alarm beeping]
- Oh, my God.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.728
- Whoo.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.608
- It is the latest
I've ever eaten dinner.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.194
- We're in Europe. Those are,
like, European things to do.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.696
- Being a chef, you have to
have practices that bring you

03:16.738 --> 03:18.990
back to center,
that kind of calm you down,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.742
finding calm in the chaos.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.993
Sh-- is hot, girl.

03:22.035 --> 03:22.994
People are coming on a yacht

03:23.036 --> 03:24.371
for a five star experience.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.498
Galley fire or not,
I have to deliver.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.210
Do you have any deck guys
that want to clean dishes?

03:30.251 --> 03:31.670
- We're doing anchor
watch all night.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.879
- OK.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.256
- I could give you
a hand for 5, 10 minutes.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.925
- Hey.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.927
<i>* *</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.555
- Yeah.
- OK.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.265
We need to get things moving.
- I'll leave too.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.393
I'm about to go to bed.
- Thank you.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.560
- Can you go grab
some food, please,

03:47.602 --> 03:49.729
because it's going cold ASAP.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.648
- Just put that--
here's a beer.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.899
I'm just gonna put it on ice.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.821
- OK.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.739
- Wow. Ridiculous.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.741
I thought that was the meal.
- Oh, no, that was a starter.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.993
We got a little strip loin,
sweet potato puree,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.162
salsa verde, and a little bit
of crispy broccoli.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.914
Enjoy it.
- Awesome, thank you.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.332
- You're welcome.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.252
I think for the first day
on any boat with a new team,

04:12.293 --> 04:14.504
<i>we haven't kind of</i>
<i>created that synergy yet.</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:15.797
Stews don't
know how I operate,

04:15.839 --> 04:17.215
and I don't know
how they operate.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
And to be honest,
I'm not impressed.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.219
How's that steak, buddy?
- Delicious.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.470
- It's good.
- I like it.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.222
- We've never been
so quiet in our life.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.976
<i>* *</i>

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
<i>- Oriana, come in.</i>

04:32.147 --> 04:33.356
<i>- Go for Oriana.</i>

04:35.150 --> 04:37.736
- I think it's best you go
to bed and get some rest.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.987
- OK, copy.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.281
I think this is looking
pretty ----ing good

04:41.322 --> 04:43.950
if you ask me.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.160
- Let's go inside.
I'm a little cold.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.745
Thanks, buddy.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.830
- Breakfast tomorrow,
what kind of time

04:48.872 --> 04:50.790
do you think you
would want breakfast?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.208
- OK. Goodnight.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.168
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.294
- Faye, Faye, Jess.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.837
- Go ahead, Jess.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.548
- Do we have a roundabout idea
about a time for breakfast?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.925
<i>- 7:00 a.m.</i>

05:00.967 --> 05:03.011
- It's 1:00 a.m. now.
Who eats breakfast

05:03.053 --> 05:04.471
after going to bed
at 1:00 a.m.?

05:04.512 --> 05:07.849
- But I can't do this.
[laughter]

05:07.891 --> 05:09.559
- Back hand spring.
Back flip.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.894
- Yeah.
<i>- OK.</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:12.228
<i>I'll be up.</i>
- Goodnight.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.438
<i>- Goodnight.</i>
<i>- Goodnight.</i>

05:13.480 --> 05:14.647
- I'm going to bed.
- All right, sleep well.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.107
- Well done today.
- Thank you.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.485
- Don't leave it a mess.
Make sure everything's tidy.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.195
- All right, see you.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.571
- Oh, my God.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.408
<i>* *</i>

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
- All right, we're tiring out.

- Goodnight.

05:28.203 --> 05:35.126
<i>* *</i>

05:48.598 --> 05:50.225
<i>- And I always</i>
<i>say how you start your day</i>

05:50.266 --> 05:51.685
dictates your day.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.770
So I try to wake up and
meditate every single day.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.980
There's a lot of energy,
output, output, output.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.565
And I have to be
on the whole time.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.734
It's not like I can
be like, eh, well.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.152
God, they'll, like,
make their own breakfast.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.739
So it's like meditate,
lemon water, coffee.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.550
<i>* *</i>

06:23.591 --> 06:24.676
- Good morning.
How are you?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.386
- Good, how are you?
- Yeah, good.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.470
Just to let you
know that breakfast

06:27.512 --> 06:28.722
is set up inside,
because I thought

06:28.763 --> 06:30.724
it was going to be a bit cold.
- Sure.

06:30.765 --> 06:31.933
- What a lovely
morning, though.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.518
- Yes.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.478
<i>- Lewis, Lewis, can you meet</i>
<i>me on the aft deck, please?</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:36.813
- Copy that.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.734
- Just want to give you a
plan for this morning, mate.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.777
OK. So we're gonna pull
the anchor up at 9:45.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.195
- Mm-hmm.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.780
- We're gonna head to our
anchorage for an adventure.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.033
The next guest activity
isn't till 2:30.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.035
<i>The guests are going</i>
<i>caving in Valldal.</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:51.536
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Who will be going ashore?</i>

06:51.578 --> 06:52.912
<i>- I'm gonna send</i>
<i>Nathan and Kyle.</i>

06:52.954 --> 06:55.248
- All right. Thanks, mate.
- No worries.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.585
<i>* *</i>

06:58.626 --> 07:01.755
- Yesterday it was
an absolute sh-- show.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.173
- No, I've never
in my whole life--

07:03.214 --> 07:05.592
- I mean, no, I didn't mean
that you was a sh-- show.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
- Yeah.
<i>- At breakfast today,</i>

07:07.844 --> 07:09.596
I don't want the same
mistake again.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.515
I need Jess to trust me,
feel comfortable.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.268
And hopefully we can
move forward from there.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.229
Considering what we've got,
we did really well.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.773
- I think you haven't
had your coffee yet.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.942
- I've had three.
- [laughs] Oh, my God.

07:22.984 --> 07:23.818
- OK, gentlemen.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.070
<i>Commence anchoring, please.</i>

07:25.111 --> 07:26.279
- Copy that.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.447
- Wow, look at that.
It's beautiful. Look.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.865
It's very Switzerland,
isn't it?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.785
And like the green and
the snow in the background--

07:31.826 --> 07:33.286
I've never been to Switzerland.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.662
[laughter]

07:34.704 --> 07:37.207
But this is what I imagine
it would look like.

07:37.248 --> 07:41.211
You just expect to hear,
like, * yodel-ay-hee-hoo *

07:41.252 --> 07:44.839
<i>* *</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:46.633

anchor in the pocket.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.801
- Thank you.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.137
<i>Time to next anchorage,</i>
<i>hour 45.</i>

07:51.179 --> 07:53.473

07:53.515 --> 07:54.683
- Morning, sweetie.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.851
Do you want a coffee?
- Yeah.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.894
- Sure?

07:57.936 --> 07:59.396
- Yeah, my stomach's
still ----ed up.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.314
I'm worried that I'm gonna
have a bad reputation

08:01.356 --> 08:02.524
on this boat now.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.650
- It's my job to
make sure you're OK.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.026
- I do.
But like I'm fine.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.696
- On my old boats,
if someone, you know, was sick,

08:07.737 --> 08:10.281
<i>they were, like, generally</i>
<i>faking it to get out of work.</i>

08:10.323 --> 08:11.658
- Do you want to go
get some breakfast?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.035
- I don't want to eat.
Like, I can't.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.620
I'm scared that
Faye thought that

08:15.662 --> 08:17.080
<i>I was faking it in some way.</i>

08:17.122 --> 08:18.748
So I'm gonna do what
I need to

08:18.790 --> 08:20.208
to show her
that wasn't the case.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.043
- I put the pot and I thought
it went on and it didn't.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.753
<i>* *</i>

08:23.795 --> 08:25.296
- They're all
sitting at the table.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.549
- You need tongs and there's
your honey, honey.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.678
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.846
- I could use a nap.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.848
- The struggle is so real
for me right now.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.433
- I need a coffee.
- Yeah.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.809
- Anybody, eggs at all?

08:37.851 --> 08:38.935
- I'll do over easy, please.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.520
- Over easy.
- I'll do that, too.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.938
- I'll do the same.
- Over hard.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.107
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.316
- Katie, how do
you like your eggs?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.526
Not wet.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.069
[laughter]

08:48.111 --> 08:50.113
- Over easy, over easy, over
hard, over easy, over easy.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.157
- Everyone likes their eggs
completely differently.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.742
Poached, fried,
scrambled, omelet,

08:53.783 --> 08:55.994
and you don't want to,
like, screw up the eggs

08:56.036 --> 08:57.495
first thing in the morning.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.372
And then people have got
a bad taste in their mouth.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.875
OK, we got over hard egg here.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.586
I remember I had an owner
that liked her eggs over easy.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.837
And you had to
have them perfect.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.213
There could be no brown.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.382
It gave me
nightmares for years,

09:09.424 --> 09:11.718
because you feel very tested
by 9:00 in the morning.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.886
- We got a stack of meat.

09:12.927 --> 09:13.887
- Never turn down
a plate of meat.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.222
[laughter]
- Over hard eggs?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.599
- [laughs].

09:17.640 --> 09:18.725
- Looks amazing.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.602
- Bacon's delicious.
- Yes.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.025
- Cap.
- Hey, boys.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.027
- Are these just other ferries,
just go back and forth?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.320
- Yeah, man.
- How far away are we?

09:30.362 --> 09:31.446
- 10 minutes.
- Are we gonna be able

09:31.488 --> 09:32.572
to get the water toys out?

09:32.614 --> 09:33.990
- Yep, give us 40 minutes.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.200

port anchor, standing by.

- Release.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.838
<i>- That's two shackles.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:50.757
That waterline
currently up and down.

- OK, guys.
I'm happy with that.

Lock her down, please.
Anchor ball up.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.304
- Yes, sir.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.432
- Maybe just go do
cabins with Kasie.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.975
- OK.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.062
- I'm gonna tell the
guests about the day.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.271
- All right.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.234
- So, as you requested
in your preference sheet,

10:09.275 --> 10:10.694
you're gonna be going caving.
- Yeah.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.070
- Yay!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.488
- Is that OK with everyone?
- Great, perfect.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.614
- That's fine.
- All right.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.282
- All right.
- OK now I'm nervous.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.410
- Let's get those towels out.
Kayaks are easy.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.828
Let's get the kayaks out.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.539

10:22.580 --> 10:23.998
Well, let's get
the sea bobs in.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.794
- All right, who's
gonna go on the kayak?

10:27.836 --> 10:30.505
- Let's go.
- Ah!

10:30.547 --> 10:31.923
- Oh, my God, Rick.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.925
- Rick's a big guy.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.593
<i>- All crew, all crew--</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:37.971
that's two guests
away on the kayak.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.472
- Yes, do they have on a vest?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.349
- Nope.
- What?

10:44.936 --> 10:46.604

you should turn around.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
Can you turn around for me,
for your vest?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.776
- Hey, he can just
take them to him, bro.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.946
Nathan just has to shut up and
listen instead of just always

10:54.988 --> 10:56.656

Y'all know who's

Boom.
Problem solved.

being inappropriate.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.724
<i>on water toys, four guests.</i>

11:22.766 --> 11:25.060
- We're doing with vests
with ----ing kayaks and sh--?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.561
- In these conditions,
I'd say it doesn't matter.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.022
- Yeah, it's not like
the tide's ripping.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.945
- Yeah, sure.
- You know?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.906
- Yep.
- Trained lifeguard.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.366
Look at how smell
that jellyfish is.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.575
Catch it.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.454
- This is gonna be a good test.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.164
We can tell the guests
if they sting or not.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.708
- These kind don't sting.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.876
- Eat it.
[laughter]

11:49.918 --> 11:51.461
- Eat it.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.462
- Don't do it.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.463
Don't, no.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.589
No, no, no.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.633
Oh.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.511
- Ah.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.096
<i>- Oh, my--I was joking.</i>

12:01.137 --> 12:02.681
Who would eat a jellyfish?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.140
- Wasn't bad, just salty.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.309
- I wonder if it stung
him a bit on the way in?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.268
- Done.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.145
- And on the way out.
[laughs]

12:11.648 --> 12:12.732
- Can I help you with anything?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.818

down here, though.

have a quick chat?

12:25.704 --> 12:27.205
- Sure.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.374
- Hey, I heard that you were
just shouting at the guests

12:29.416 --> 12:30.500
about life rafts.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.335
- Oh, I didn't shout
at them directly.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.421
I just told them I think
it's best they turn around.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.343
- It's no biggie.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.137
My way of leadership
might not be the best.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.888
Let's be honest,
I try and avoid conflict.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.390
- Sure.
- Thanks, mate.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.183
A previous crew member once
had an intervention with me

12:47.225 --> 12:50.061
because I needed to stop
being the devil's advocate.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.439
- Oh, my goodness.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.481
- Athlete, buddy.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.482
- It's so hard to get up.

- Ladies, so yesterday was
an absolute sh-- show.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.241
Because you stepped up
so well yesterday...

13:04.951 --> 13:06.828
- Yeah.
- And I know you're gonna love

13:06.870 --> 13:08.288
this excursion.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.248
Do you wanna go caving?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.460
- Yes. Anything that has to do
with, like, hikes and stuff.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.378
Oh, or exhilaration.

13:16.671 --> 13:17.756

13:26.264 --> 13:28.099
- No? Enjoy your trip
into the cave today.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.393
- Cave?
Cave man.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.771
- Nathan seeks
a lot of attention.

- You guys ready?
- Let's go!

13:33.772 --> 13:34.898
- I'm excited!

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
- Oh, that's for me?

13:35.982 --> 13:36.900
- Oh, I thought
that was for me.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.443
Sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.861
Save a life.

it's not even funny.

Yay.

up about this adventure.

<i>We're gonna be hiking</i>

- Helmet first.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.638
- You're definitely gonna fall.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.807
- Normally with my guests,
I would, you know,

14:50.849 --> 14:53.977
take them out, go on the
jet skis, wake-boarding--

14:54.019 --> 14:55.228
nothing like this.

both carabiners through.

<i>time I'm actually with guests</i>

a professional here?

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
- Come on, bros.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.697

escalator on the way down?

- Good job, fam.
We got through the beginning.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.288

something like fat or--

15:55.330 --> 15:57.123
- Grease.
- Yeah, exactly.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.500
- Or it could be anything.
It's from food.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.918
- That's just a degreaser
you got there?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.003
- It's a dry cleaning agent,
with some vinegar.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.214
Just rug it off and there'll
be no stain there afterwards.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.507
- You don't think
it ever bothers anybody

16:05.548 --> 16:07.717
that everything smells
like vinegar on here?

16:07.759 --> 16:10.762
- There's worse things on a
boat that smell than vinegar.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.263
- [laughs]

16:12.305 --> 16:13.765
- What I was thinking--
- Yeah?

16:13.807 --> 16:16.476
- When they get back, I can
make homemade hot chocolate,

16:16.518 --> 16:17.560
and maybe throw
in a bit of rum.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.229

I just got a few balloons.

Two nights with four hours'
sleep, I'm not gonna be cute.

anybody in this cave?

I think I just
pulled my kidney.

Look at this.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.305
This is awesome down here.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.642
- You're free to explore
wherever you want.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.437
- Oh, my God.
- We have our cathedral.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.731
- This is amazing.
- You guys want some water?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.735
- I got water.
I got gum.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.028
I got menthols.
- I'll have a water.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.529
<i>- Sure. Call me mom.</i>
<i>Yeah, I don't mind.</i>

17:09.571 --> 17:11.364
<i>Moms are powerful, man.</i>

17:11.406 --> 17:14.951
Like, think of anything
someone could be perfect at.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.245
And then think of my mom.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.748
Exactly, she's
the best, actually.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.957
- I'm with you.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.250
- I want to go upstairs.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.711
- I'm trying to figure
out foothold here.

17:24.753 --> 17:25.962
- This actually is cool.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.214
I've never done anything
like this in my life.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.091
- Growing up,
we were always poor

17:30.133 --> 17:32.177
and never had the chance
to even go

17:32.218 --> 17:33.970
<i>on a vacation anywhere.</i>

17:34.012 --> 17:36.473
Every time I wake up,
like I can't believe

17:36.514 --> 17:37.974
I'm at where I'm at.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.643
And I've gotten here today,
practically on my own.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.312
So I'm proud of
myself on that one.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.855
- It's eerie.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.191
- Man, look at the way that
sh-- lifts up her ass, man.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.609
- Stop looking at that.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.152
- Careful,
these last two steps here.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.029
- All right.
- Come on.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.866
- Hey, we're having our first
candlelit cave adventure,

17:54.908 --> 17:56.284
I guess.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.996
- All right, dude.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.999
- I'm all for good banter.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
- Kiss her!

18:04.918 --> 18:07.003
- But then when it
starts crossing a line...

18:07.045 --> 18:08.421
- Kiss her!

18:08.463 --> 18:10.382
- Please don't keep going.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.008
- Just a bit on the cheek.
There you go.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.301
- Aww.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.595
<i>- Coming up...</i>
- Banana pancakes.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.805
- Whoa.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.184
- There's no plates.
- Are you joking?

18:21.226 --> 18:22.686
- We've forgotten the plates.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.442
- Kiss her!
- All right, dude.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.695
- Kiss her!
Just on the cheek.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.614
There you go.
- Aw.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.032
<i>- Unfortunately, there's</i>
<i>gonna be situations</i>

18:36.074 --> 18:40.995
you get into where guests
will do something that could

18:41.037 --> 18:42.997
be potentially inappropriate.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.210
- No way.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.462
<i>- And you have to know</i>
<i>how to deal with it</i>

18:49.504 --> 18:50.880
<i>in a professional manner.</i>

18:50.922 --> 18:52.924
And I don't think Kyle
dealt with it well.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.427
- Can we get out of here?
- All right, I'm going down.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.595
- I got you.
One at a time.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.389
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.890
That's awesome.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.434
- There's still
beers on the boat?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.602
- Yes, and I'm very excited
for your birthday celebration.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.563
- Oh, is that tonight?
- Oh.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.939
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.816
Now we gotta get back up.

the balloons up, please?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.706

- I hope the wind

19:24.748 --> 19:26.041

- Wait, balloon down,

- Oh.
- Being on a yacht

19:29.419 --> 19:31.296
for my 40th birthday
would be pretty sweet.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.672
Give me a second.
- OK.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.716
- Sorry.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.884
<i>I'm only 27 right now.</i>

19:35.925 --> 19:37.510
So at age 40, I wanna
have made it.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.803
- Just hold that one.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.513
- Yeah, I just don't want
to get it twisted apart.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.391
Which means that I have
13 years to either marry

19:43.433 --> 19:45.810
someone rich,
sue someone rich...

19:48.772 --> 19:50.899

- Yeah, pleasure.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.181
- What an excursion.
That was awesome.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.392

- I've got to go pee so bad.

How's it going?

hot chocolate of your life?

- Yes.
- And the best cookies.

walking around the cave?

20:57.549 --> 20:58.675
- Oh, no, dude.

20:58.717 --> 20:59.676
It was a great
time, though, dude.

on a boat before?

- Not yacht,
never been on a yacht.

It's all brand new for me.
I'm trying to keep up.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.537
It's a lot.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.956
They gave me super short
shorts, which is cool.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.083
- That's why I kind of thought
you were European at first.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.293
- 'Cause of the shorts?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.544
- I didn't hear you speak.

But the first time
I saw you, I thought you

21:35.754 --> 21:36.963
were definitely from the UK.

- [in English accent]
Blimey, I'm from the UK.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.426
I'll give it a go.
- Yeah.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.761
- Yeah!
Give it a go.

24:29.803 --> 24:30.762
I've never sabered
a bottle before.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.180
But in my career...

24:35.183 --> 24:36.851
I've been struck
by lightning.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.269
- Cap, sir.
- [laughs]

24:38.311 --> 24:40.647
So I think I can saber
a bottle of ----ing champagne.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.273
- You gotta say some words.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.483
- Release the Kraken?

24:43.525 --> 24:44.984
- [laughs]

24:45.819 --> 24:47.779
[cheering]

24:47.821 --> 24:50.198
- Well done.
- Enjoy.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.200
- I'll see you for dessert?
- Yes.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.284
Yes.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.369
- It's sunset now.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.329
All right, let's get this in.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.747
- Yeah.
- Going in, man.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.124
Going in.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.713
[snoring]
- OK.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.674
Damn.
We did it in the wrong order.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.300
- These go on the wall
behind the kayak.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.095
- Yeah. [laughs]

25:12.137 --> 25:13.805
[clattering]

25:13.847 --> 25:15.724
- Mother----er

25:19.811 --> 25:21.646
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.814
- So cold.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.107
- Interior, interior,

25:24.149 --> 25:25.316
please can
I have an update on service?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.611
- Hey, we're missing
some forks on the table.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.447
- Are we?
- Yeah, I just noticed.

25:30.488 --> 25:33.324
- Well done.
- Girls, girls, can I plate?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.326
- That's why we should always
have some forks on that...

25:35.368 --> 25:37.495
- I know.
- Server thing just in case.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.872
- Interior, interior.

25:38.913 --> 25:40.623
I just wanted to follow
up on the dinner vibe.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.168
What's happening
with the guests?

25:43.209 --> 25:46.129
I'm getting nothing, crickets.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.444
- It was a great experience.
- Did you hear

26:09.486 --> 26:10.612

I'm sorry.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.097
- Yeah, cleared. Sorry.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.973
It's been a bit hectic, sorry.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.478
- More communication, OK.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.898
- For all that stuff.
- Yeah.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.149
- 'Cause I've got
the steaks going cold.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.281
- They're all busy.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.825
- OK.
- Tell them to be

26:56.866 --> 26:58.993
in the galley in two minutes.
- I've had so many different

26:59.035 --> 27:00.912
types of chefs in the past--

27:00.954 --> 27:04.207
stressy chefs, moody chefs,
chefs that don't wanna cook,

27:04.249 --> 27:05.875
chefs that can't cook.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.419
<i>Jess is a great chef.</i>

27:07.460 --> 27:09.129
<i>But I'm not here</i>
<i>to argue with you.</i>

27:09.170 --> 27:10.839
Just do your job,
get on with it.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.551
<i>- All interior, can you come</i>
<i>to the galley to do service?</i>

27:14.592 --> 27:17.429
- We'll do the--get into the
white site literally right

27:17.470 --> 27:20.306
before we get into the port.
- Okay.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.017
- So, guys, as you
can see, some of them

27:22.058 --> 27:23.184
are bigger than others.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.894
So the big ones
are for the guys.

27:24.936 --> 27:26.354
- I mean, you got four hours
sleep.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.189
- I think it was three hours.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.691
- Make sure the
meat's facing them.

27:29.733 --> 27:30.692
- Please tell me
this is risotto.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.860
- I think it is.
- I think it is.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.319
- Yeah.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.782
- Ooh, look at that
all together.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.200
- For main course
this evening,

27:39.242 --> 27:40.910
we have a lemon
and truffle risotto

27:40.952 --> 27:43.872
with filet mignon, grilled
asparagus, and a little bit

27:43.913 --> 27:45.165
of truffle cream on top.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.708
all: Thank you.
- Thank you, Jess.

27:46.750 --> 27:47.917
- Thank you, Jess.
- Thank you, thank you.

27:47.959 --> 27:49.794
- I mean, this looks
perfectly cooked.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.004
- I'm saving that
bite for last.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.215
- That filet is absurd.
- It looks great.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.052
- Oh, my gosh. Yeah.
- Stupid good.

27:57.093 --> 28:00.180
- OK, all is good in the hood.

28:02.891 --> 28:06.394

- OK.
- And then have

28:09.939 --> 28:11.524
you start at 6:00.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.692

28:12.734 --> 28:14.736
Go on, man, get some sleep.
- Thank you.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.154
- Thank you for adapting.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.572
- It's all right.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.741
- I've not seen you girls
in your black shirt.

28:19.783 --> 28:20.742
- Oh, really?

28:20.784 --> 28:21.743
- Or not noticed, I don't know.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.620
- You aren't awake?

28:23.661 --> 28:24.788
- Yeah, that might be it.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.790
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.667
- Lewis reminds me of
like an innocent little

28:28.708 --> 28:30.585
like, British puppy.

28:30.627 --> 28:33.880
It's nice that he's a gentleman
and not a total douche bag,

28:33.922 --> 28:35.298
like most yachties.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.759
- Well, I'm off to bed. Night.
- Good night.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.719
See you in the morning.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.180
- How is everything?
- This is so good.

28:42.222 --> 28:45.266
- She's a magician.
- Best chef I've ever had.

28:45.308 --> 28:49.062
- My hammy's real sore
after that escapade.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.480
- That was a ----ing workout.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.148
- We shouldn't have climbed
in that cave today, guys.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.651
We have kids at home.
[laughter]

28:54.693 --> 28:55.902
- She knows.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.278
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.197
Love your bodies.
- Happy birthday to you.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.574
- Jess, dinner has
gone down amazingly.

29:01.616 --> 29:04.244
So just giving
you the heads up.

29:04.285 --> 29:07.831
Hopefully, I've delivered
clear communication, OK, Jess?

29:07.872 --> 29:08.915
- Copy.
I'm gonna grab the cake.

29:08.957 --> 29:10.291
- Copy.

29:14.045 --> 29:15.338
<i>- Oriana, come in.</i>

29:15.380 --> 29:16.798
<i>- Copy from Oriana.</i>

29:16.840 --> 29:19.092
- Are you heading to
bed soon, 'cause I really want

29:19.134 --> 29:21.219
to deliver the birthday cake
with us as well.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.637
<i>- Copy that, Faye,</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

29:22.679 --> 29:24.180
- We're gonna start
singing, people.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.474
Are you ready?
- With just cutting the cake--

29:26.516 --> 29:29.060
we'll dish it out
and then you sit down

29:29.102 --> 29:30.395
and I'll give you one as well.

29:30.437 --> 29:34.024
- * Happy birthday to you *

29:36.359 --> 29:39.070
- My 40th birthday
was also on a yacht.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.989
But I was working.

29:41.031 --> 29:42.449
[cheering]

29:42.490 --> 29:44.784
- We've just got
a moist chocolate cake.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.162
- It's a moist--
- Ohh!

29:47.203 --> 29:49.164
- Oh, you did it on purpose.
- I'm sorry.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.208
You opened that door.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.668
- If you're gonna
do a chocolate cake,

29:53.710 --> 29:54.794
you gotta make it moist.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.046
- Just say cake.

29:56.087 --> 29:57.255
- Because nobody
likes a dry chocolate cake

29:57.297 --> 29:58.506
on their birthday.

29:58.548 --> 30:00.008
- Birthday cake, that's it.
- Birthday cake.

30:00.050 --> 30:01.718
- Finished.
- [claps]

30:01.760 --> 30:04.346

all: Hey!

30:04.387 --> 30:05.764

30:07.057 --> 30:08.016

leave me hanging?

30:08.058 --> 30:09.351
- Oh, sorry, man.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.852
I thought you wanted
me to give me a tip.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.270

- To Cap.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.438

Cheers.
- Right here.

30:18.109 --> 30:19.444

30:19.486 --> 30:21.363
- Your crew is awesome,
though, seriously, Cap.

30:21.404 --> 30:23.198
- Most of them, right?
- They're so good.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.282
- Every single one.
- No, everyone.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.785

30:28.036 --> 30:29.621
- Sleep good?
- Yeah.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.122
- Good enough.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.416
You're gonna be up until sun.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.960
- 5:00, so whenever sun rises.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.755
Sun's out pretty
much all day, so--

30:40.757 --> 30:42.467
- So tell us about
the excursion today.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.219
Did you guys get looked after?

30:44.260 --> 30:45.720
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.223

30:48.264 --> 30:50.725
Just ask Kasie.

what do you got?

30:52.769 --> 30:53.978
- Uh-oh.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.397

30:55.438 --> 30:57.065
- Kyle, you gotta
slow down, guy.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.566
- Kasie had to put up with him.

30:58.608 --> 30:59.818

put up with him?

30:59.859 --> 31:02.320

- Guys.

31:07.742 --> 31:08.868
<i>- Coming up...</i>

going to the guests

and making them
feel uncomfortable.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.707
- Boom. Boom.

31:13.748 --> 31:16.626

an eye on him very closely.

31:22.465 --> 31:23.425

slow down, guy.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.301

32:38.416 --> 32:40.126

- No.

you know.

32:41.670 --> 32:42.796
- What?

- In the boat contract,
said crew members

- "Twister."

- Come on.

decorations, all the bags

You can pool for breakfast.

your hair, ironing your hair,

- No.

- Terrible idea.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.048

to my orange juice.

Oh, my God.

- Everyone's up.

We're gonna do brunch
at about 11:00.

finish the table,

everything's good to go.

get them inflated

- Can I leave you with
these two fenders?

35:25.542 --> 35:27.168
So inflate and tie them on.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.005
Can you do that for me?

35:30.046 --> 35:31.131
- What do you mean
tie them up, just put

35:31.172 --> 35:32.424
them back in the corner there.

35:32.465 --> 35:33.800
- You could put one in
the corner if you want.

35:33.842 --> 35:36.845
Some bosons just walk around
really happy to demand

35:36.886 --> 35:38.430

in high positions.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.015

works with us, you know?

35:41.850 --> 35:43.685
- Any questions,
don't hesitate.

35:43.727 --> 35:45.061
- Kasie, Kasie, Kerry.

you go up there,
there's something wrong.

Hello.

- Of possibly some people
being inappropriate.

- Yeah.

flirting going on. Yeah.

36:10.045 --> 36:12.589
- Who was flirting.
- Uh, Kyle.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.215
<i>- With who?</i>
<i>- With me.</i>

36:14.257 --> 36:15.467

- Yeah.

36:15.508 --> 36:16.801
- It's unacceptable.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.721
- Yeah.
- All right?

36:19.763 --> 36:21.139
- Yeah.
- So did he make you

36:21.181 --> 36:22.223
feel uncomfortable?

36:22.265 --> 36:23.683
- I mean, I took it.

36:23.725 --> 36:27.020
But like, you know, the
guests were egging Kyle on.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.980
I think it's just
friendly on his side.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.649
And I was professional.
- But you know, that's not OK.

36:31.691 --> 36:32.901
You shouldn't be put
in that position,

36:32.942 --> 36:35.070
and we have standards
on the vessel. OK?

36:36.154 --> 36:37.697
The guests, if they
want us to be part

36:37.739 --> 36:39.157
of their fun, that's great.

36:39.199 --> 36:41.284
But there's a line.
Kyle crossed the line.

<i>never be put in a position</i>

36:43.161 --> 36:44.162

36:44.204 --> 36:45.914
And doing stuff
in front of people

36:45.955 --> 36:47.290
makes them more uncomfortable.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.417
And they're more likely
to tolerate it 'cause they

36:49.459 --> 36:51.044
<i>don't wanna create a scene.</i>

36:51.086 --> 36:52.629
That's a horrible
place to put somebody.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.506
If you ever feel
uncomfortable,

36:54.547 --> 36:55.840
come talk to me.
- I will.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.342
- OK?
- Yeah. Got it.

36:57.384 --> 36:59.761
Is there anything I can
do for the situation?

37:01.137 --> 37:02.389
- Got it. All right.
- All right. Thank you.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.146
- I don't wanna go, guys.
- I know.

37:11.606 --> 37:12.691
- Did the anchors
come up already?

37:12.732 --> 37:14.025
I didn't hear them.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.777
- I think that has to happen.
- Before we move?

37:15.819 --> 37:17.237
- Before we start to go.
- Yeah. [laughs]

37:18.238 --> 37:19.072

a platter for bacon,

37:38.883 --> 37:41.553
a platter for sausage.
I would say six platters.

37:41.594 --> 37:43.847
- Do you want us--just me--

37:43.888 --> 37:44.848
- You'll grab the platters?

37:44.889 --> 37:46.641
- Yeah.
- Great.

37:46.683 --> 37:47.892
- This is a little weird.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.227
I shouldn't be the
one assisting Kasie.

37:49.269 --> 37:50.687
I was her boss.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.147
She should be
the one assisting me.

Thank you.

- Flip cup or 40 hands
on the boat.

do have 40s, though.

- We don't, but I can tape
a bunch of coronas together.

38:26.056 --> 38:27.390
- That was the
best answer ever.

38:28.767 --> 38:30.352

How about this?

Why don't you guys come eat.

I can see what we can do.

But now I'm just going
to make it tacky.

40:54.329 --> 40:55.455
- I know.

40:55.497 --> 40:56.581
I want to make sure
that we're on track.

40:56.623 --> 40:57.582
- I'm trying.

40:57.624 --> 40:58.583
- There you go.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.460
- Perfect.
- So cool.

41:00.502 --> 41:01.544
- Yeah, they'll love it.

41:01.586 --> 41:03.254
- I'm a very innovative person.

41:03.296 --> 41:06.675
The squeegee shot is one
of the better inventions

41:06.716 --> 41:08.259
I've ever come up with.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.639
- Probably doing the booty
chug where you just start it

41:12.681 --> 41:14.933
from the top of the girl's
back and it's just going

41:14.974 --> 41:16.059
straight into your mouth.

41:16.101 --> 41:16.976
Boom, ready?
- We're ready.

41:17.018 --> 41:18.395
- We're ready.

41:18.436 --> 41:19.938
- I mean, there's a bikini
there to protect it,

41:19.979 --> 41:23.525
so it's OK.

41:23.566 --> 41:24.943
- Oh, yeah that's gonna work.
- Easy.

41:24.984 --> 41:28.154
- OK, That works.
- OK, all good in the hood.

41:28.196 --> 41:30.323
- Shotty, shotty, shotty,
shotty, shotty, shotty, shots!

41:30.365 --> 41:31.366
- Shots!

41:31.408 --> 41:32.909
- Time for shots!

41:32.951 --> 41:34.369
- It's shot 30, baby.

41:34.411 --> 41:37.247
- So you've had ski shots
before, but you've never had--

41:37.288 --> 41:40.417
- Squeegee shot!
- Squeegee shots, yay!

41:40.458 --> 41:41.960
- That actually works.
<i>- Lewis?</i>

41:42.002 --> 41:43.169
- Go ahead, Kerry.

41:43.211 --> 41:44.754
<i>- Can you please</i>
<i>come to the bridge?</i>

41:44.796 --> 41:46.339
<i>- Copy that.</i>

41:48.216 --> 41:50.552
- Last night, the guests
made a comment to me

41:50.593 --> 41:54.889
that there was inappropriate
behavior with the crew

41:54.931 --> 41:57.142
on the shore excursion.
- OK.

41:57.183 --> 41:58.852
- Kyle has been
flirting with the girls

41:58.893 --> 41:59.978
in front of the guests.

42:00.020 --> 42:03.064
- Bottoms up.
- Ahh!

42:03.106 --> 42:04.566
- Squeegee shots!

42:04.607 --> 42:05.942
- There's a time and a place.
- No, no, yeah, yeah.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.318
- You know what I mean?

42:07.360 --> 42:09.070
<i>- I need to keep a</i>
<i>real close eye on Kyle.</i>

42:09.112 --> 42:11.698
<i>On my boat, there's</i>
<i>a three-strike policy.</i>

42:11.740 --> 42:13.324
This is strike one.

42:13.366 --> 42:15.326
I want you to observe and
report back to me, please.

42:15.368 --> 42:17.162
- OK.
<i>- We all make mistakes.</i>

42:17.203 --> 42:18.455
<i>But if you can't</i>
<i>get your sh-- together</i>

42:18.496 --> 42:20.832
after three times,
your NBO'd, Next Boat Off.

42:20.874 --> 42:23.543
I'm going to address it.
- [hooting]

42:25.712 --> 42:27.672
<i>- Next time on</i>
<i>"Below Deck Adventure"...</i>

42:27.714 --> 42:29.507
- Yeah!
- Get 'em, Cap.

42:29.549 --> 42:31.843
- Run.
- Engineering, engineering.

42:31.885 --> 42:33.094
We have an engine failure.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.679
I've lost starboard engine.
- Throw it.

42:34.721 --> 42:35.889
- To the first charter.

42:35.930 --> 42:38.933
Cheers to Team Mercury.
[clattering]

42:38.975 --> 42:40.393
- Oh, my God.

42:40.435 --> 42:43.313
- You did something.
- Ooh!

42:43.355 --> 42:45.607
<i>- The guy's slipping</i>
<i>in the abyss, you can see it.</i>

42:45.648 --> 42:46.858
<i>One more drink</i>

42:46.900 --> 42:48.109
<i>and it's lights out.</i>
- [hooting]

42:57.077 --> 42:58.203
- I will not allow
anyone to be threatened

42:58.244 --> 42:59.537
by another crew member at all.

42:59.579 --> 43:00.914
<i>I'm not gonna</i>
<i>tolerate bullies.</i>

43:00.955 --> 43:02.791
I'm not gonna tolerate
anybody who makes

43:02.832 --> 43:04.000
someone feel uncomfortable.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.627
- He's consistently
crossing the line.

43:05.669 --> 43:07.212
- He has the right
to explain himself.

43:07.253 --> 43:10.674
But these actions are grounds
for instant dismissal.
