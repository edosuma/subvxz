13:43.865 --> 13:46.948
Oh, Ms. Swan,
this is not appropriate.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.360
The only thing not appropriate
is this ceremony.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.615
She does not have the power
to appoint him.

13:51.707 --> 13:54.540
The town charter clearly states
the Mayor shall appoint...

13:54.626 --> 13:56.867
A candidate.
You can appoint a candidate.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.327
It calls for an election.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.538
The term "candidate"
is applied loosely.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.792
NO, it's not.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.043
It requires a vote.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.167
And guess what, Madam Mayor,
I'm running.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.964
Fine. SO is Sidney.

I guess we'll learn a little something
about the will Of the people.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.146
I guess we will.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.166
You need to find another way.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.581
You need to choose a different path.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.420
Choose?

14:43.925 --> 14:45.756
What choice do l have?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.502
Everyone has a choice.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.805
I'm the town coward.

14:53.769 --> 14:59.264
The only choice l have
is which corner tO hide in.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.939
I'm lame, friendless.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.492
The only thing I've got is my boy.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.200
And they're gonna take him
away from me.

15:19.127 --> 15:24.838
If they take him away,
I will truly, truly become dust.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.965
Not if you have power.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.718
You may as well say diamonds.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.302
Get a hold Of yourself.

15:35.811 --> 15:36.800
Think.

15:36.895 --> 15:41.264
Why do you think that someone
as powerful as the Dark One

15:41.358 --> 15:46.068
would work for a useless fOOl
like the Duke Of the Frontlands?

15:46.988 --> 15:47.977
Tell me.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.483
The Duke has the Dark One in thrall.

15:52.661 --> 15:56.745
He's enslaved him with the power
Of a mystical dagger.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.707
And on the blade is written a name.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.411
The true name Of the Dark One.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.665
If you were to steal the dagger,

16:10.387 --> 16:14.426
then you would control
the Dark One yourself,

16:14.516 --> 16:20.011
and then no one would be able
to take your son away from you.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.100
What?

16:24.025 --> 16:26.607
TO keep a man like the Dark One
as a slave?

16:26.778 --> 16:30.270
NO, I can't. I'd be terrified.

16:30.866 --> 16:35.781
Then perhaps,
instead Of controlling the power,

16:38.790 --> 16:41.748
you need to take it.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.699
What does it do?

21:24.659 --> 21:28.652
If I own that dagger,
I control the Dark One.

21:29.664 --> 21:33.327
If I kill the Dark One with
the dagger, I take his powers.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.582

21:39.090 --> 21:41.376
I could get to redeem myself.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.379
I could turn it towards good.

And they did.

41:35.369 --> 41:36.404
NO way.

41:37.621 --> 41:39.282
There's no way you planned that.

41:39.373 --> 41:43.833
Everyone's afraid Of Regina.
But they're more afraid Of me.

41:44.378 --> 41:46.960
By standing up to me,
you won them over.

41:47.422 --> 41:48.628
It was the only way.

41:49.049 --> 41:50.630
You knew I'd agree.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.002
Oh, yeah.

41:53.387 --> 41:56.379
I know how to recognize
a desperate soul.

42:02.646 --> 42:03.977
Why did you do this?

42:05.357 --> 42:09.066
We made a deal some time back,
Ms. Swan.

42:09.236 --> 42:12.148
We established that
you owed me a favor.

42:12.531 --> 42:16.149
I know that can be a bad feeling,
owing someone.

42:17.828 --> 42:20.035
Now that you're Sheriff,

42:20.122 --> 42:23.740
I'm sure we'll find some way for you
to pay back what you owe me.

42:28.338 --> 42:29.919
Congratulations.

42:33.635 --> 42:35.375
