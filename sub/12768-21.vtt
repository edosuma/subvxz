HYPERVIGILANCE, NUMBNESS
OR AVOIDANCE.

09:58.709 --> 10:02.041
HAVE YOU TREATED
VIOLET TURNER FOR P.T.S.D.?

10:02.083 --> 10:03.583
COUNSELED HER?

10:03.625 --> 10:05.583
WELL, I'M HER FRIEND,
HER EX-BOYFRIEND,

10:05.625 --> 10:07.583
AND... IT'S A FUNNY STORY,
ACTUALLY.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.000
I... (laughs)

10:09.041 --> 10:11.250
I WAS ALMOST LUCAS' FATHER.

10:11.291 --> 10:14.792
EXCUSE ME. HOW EXACTLY
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

10:14.834 --> 10:17.041
WELL, VIOLET AND I
WERE DATING

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
WHEN SHE STARTED SLEEPING
WITH PETE.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.834
UH, WHICH IS TO SAY, UH...

10:21.875 --> 10:24.625
NOT THAT SHE'S PROMISCUOUS.
SHE'S NOT.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.041
IT'S JUST THAT SHE, UM...

10:26.083 --> 10:28.625
WELL, IT WAS A CONFUSING TIME
FOR ALL OF US, I THINK.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.542
AND, UM... MY POINT WAS

10:30.583 --> 10:33.041
THAT NONE OF US KNEW
WHO THE FATHER WAS

10:33.083 --> 10:35.417
UNTIL A FEW WEEKS
AFTER LUCAS WAS BORN,

10:35.458 --> 10:38.542
SO I NATURALLY BECAME
VERY ATTACHED TO HIM.

10:38.583 --> 10:41.041
DR. TURNER DIDN'T KNOW
DR. WILDER WAS THE FATHER

10:41.083 --> 10:43.333
WHEN SHE TURNED THE CHILD
OVER TO HIM?

10:43.375 --> 10:46.083
NOT DEFINITIVELY, NO.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.542
BACK TO THE QUESTION. HAVE YOU
EVER TREATED VIOLET TURNER?

10:48.583 --> 10:50.542
NO. GIVEN OUR HISTORY,

10:50.583 --> 10:53.291
BEING HER THERAPIST
WOULD BE A BREACH OF ETHICS.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.875
SO GIVEN HER BEHAVIOR,

10:54.917 --> 10:56.875
HER INABILITY
TO CONNECT WITH HER SON

10:56.917 --> 10:58.375
AFTER THE ATTACK,

10:58.417 --> 11:00.792
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT VIOLET TURNER

11:00.834 --> 11:02.709
SUFFERS FROM P.T.S.D.?

11:02.750 --> 11:05.250
OBJECTION. DR. WALLACE IS NOT
CALLED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS

11:05.291 --> 11:08.250
NOR AS DR. TURNER'S
PSYCHIATRIST.

11:08.291 --> 11:10.709
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.041
(speaking inaudibly)

11:14.083 --> 11:17.542
I SUSPECT VIOLET SUFFERS
FROM P.T.S.D.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.250
HEY. THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.125
OH, GOD. I WOULDN'T HAVE
MISSED THIS FOR THE WORLD.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.917
OH, I'M JUST SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY

11:32.959 --> 11:34.917
THAT YOU HAVE TO
GO THROUGH ALL THIS.

11:34.959 --> 11:37.500
AND, UH, I HOPE
THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.

11:37.542 --> 11:41.792
WHEN YOU WERE GONE AND YOU
COULDN'T BE THERE FOR LUCAS...

11:41.834 --> 11:43.208
I...

11:43.250 --> 11:45.417
I ENCOURAGED ADDISON
TO BE THERE.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.709
THANK YOU.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.208
THANK YOU.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.709
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.125
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT, AND YOU'RE
GONNA GET YOUR SON BACK.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.000
OKAY.
ABSOLUTELY.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.000
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.750
WE CALL DR. AMELIA SHEPHERD
TO THE STAND.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.333
P.T.S.D. CAUSES IDENTIFIABLE
NEURAL CORRELATES.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.041
UH, AND WE CAN SEE THEM CLEARLY
IN AN M.E.G. SCAN.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
HERE WE SEE THAT VIOLET HAS

12:10.125 --> 12:13.542
HIGH ABNORMAL ACTIVITY
IN THE TEMPORAL LOBES

12:13.583 --> 12:15.208
AS WELL AS ATROPHY
IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.834
BOTH ARE CONSISTENT
WITH P.T.S.D.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.041
CAN YOU INTERPRET
THESE FINDINGS?

12:19.083 --> 12:21.750
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT P.T.S.D.
IS A PHYSICAL DISEASE.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.417
WHICH MEANS?
IT'S TREATABLE.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.041
TALK THERAPY,
ANTIANXIETY DRUGS?

12:26.083 --> 12:27.750
BOTH ARE TRADITIONAL ROUTES.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.000
PERSONALLY, I WOULD TREAT IT
WITH BETA-BLOCKERS.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.166
P.T.S.D. MANIFESTS WITH
A HOST OF PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS--

12:32.208 --> 12:35.041
RAPID HEART RATE,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.041
TAKE AWAY THE PHYSICAL RESPONSE
FROM THE MEMORIES,

12:37.083 --> 12:40.041
AND YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY
THE CONDITION.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.041
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
DR. TURNER COULD BE TREATED

12:43.083 --> 12:45.041
AS EASILY AS PRESCRIBING
A HEART MEDICATION?

12:45.083 --> 12:48.041
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
THIS IS A PHYSICAL AILMENT.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.041
WAR VETS, VICTIMS OF ABUSE,

12:50.083 --> 12:52.458
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN
ACCIDENTS--THEY ALL GET IT.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.208
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE
THEIR KIDS AWAY FROM THEM.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.792
GIVE THE WOMAN
BACK HER CHILD.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.041
(Addison) PETE--

13:04.083 --> 13:07.500
OKAY, YOU...
ARE NOT WELCOME HERE ANYMORE.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.041
WHOA. FIRST, SCREW YOU,

13:09.083 --> 13:11.041
AND SECOND,
THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUSE.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.291
THIS IS ADDISON'S HOUSE.
COME ON.
AMELIA--

13:13.333 --> 13:15.291
LOOK, LOOK, WE HAVE TO GO
PICK UP LUCAS ANYWAY.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.625
LET'S JUST STAY
AT YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT.
NO. PACK AND LEAVE.

13:17.667 --> 13:20.834
PETE, LET'S JUST--
I WAS CALLED TO TESTIFY, I GOT
ON THE STAND, I TOLD THE TRUTH.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.834
YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF
MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR FIVE MINUTES.
OKAY--

13:22.875 --> 13:25.500
YOU COME TO MY CUSTODY HEARING,
A CUSTODY HEARING FOR MY SON...
WHO DO YOU THINK--WHAT?

13:25.542 --> 13:28.041
OKAY, YOU GUYS--
I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED
NEUROSURGEON.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.500
AND YOU START SPOUTING SOME
PSUEDO-SCIENTIFIC CRAP--
(Amelia and Addison
yelling over each other)

13:30.542 --> 13:33.834
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL BE
AT MY HOUSE IF YOU NEED ME.
ADDIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I MEAN, YOU ARE LETTING HIM--

13:33.875 --> 13:36.750
IT'S HIS CHILD.
(door opens and closes)

13:36.792 --> 13:38.750
YEAH?
WELL, THE WAY HE'S ACTING,

13:38.792 --> 13:41.333
MAYBE HE'S THE ONE
WITH P.T.S.D.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.583
(woman)
WHEN YOU SAY "ABANDONMENT"--

13:43.625 --> 13:45.041
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.875
VIOLET ABANDONED OUR CHILD.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.041
THAT'S A STRONG WORD,
"ABANDONMENT."

13:49.083 --> 13:50.875
ANOTHER STRONG WORD IS "HATE."

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
HAVE YOU EVER HATED ANYONE,
DR. WILDER?

13:52.917 --> 13:54.542
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.667
YOU WERE MARRIED, CORRECT?

13:56.709 --> 13:57.709
YES.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.709
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR WIFE?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.667
(clears throat) SHE DIED.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.583
HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT HER DEATH?

14:03.625 --> 14:07.041
DID YOU EVER SAY
THAT YOU HATED YOUR WIFE

14:07.083 --> 14:10.125
AND YOU FELT NOTHING
ABOUT HER DEATH?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.750
YES.

14:16.083 --> 14:20.041
I DON'T CARE WHO SHE'S BEEN
TO YOU IN THE PAST.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.709
TODAY VIOLET IS YOUR ENEMY,

14:21.750 --> 14:23.709
AND WE'RE FIGHTING
FOR LUCAS' LIFE.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.125
NOW DO YOU WANT TO WIN THIS
OR NOT?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.500
VIOLET TURNER'S
A GREAT MOTHER.
(Broome)
IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU PAUSE

14:29.542 --> 14:32.333
THAT VIOLET
GAVE HER BABY AWAY TO PETE?

14:32.375 --> 14:34.333
VIOLET KNEW HER LIMITS
AND ASKED FOR HELP.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.333
SHE DID MORE FOR HER CHILD
THAN MOST MOTHERS DO.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.625
SHE COULDA KEPT HER CHILD,
HIRED A NANNY, SPENT HER DAYS

14:38.667 --> 14:40.917
LOCKED IN HER ROOM
WITH THE VAPORS LIKE MY MOTHER,

14:40.959 --> 14:42.750
BUT SHE DIDN'T.
DO YOU THINK--

14:42.792 --> 14:45.000
I'M NOT FINISHED. SHE HANDED
LUCAS OVER TO HIS FATHER

14:45.041 --> 14:47.000
OUT OF LOVE FOR HER CHILD.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.041
NOW SHE'S SPENDING
ALL HER TIME

14:49.083 --> 14:51.041
APOLOGIZING FOR TAKING CARE
OF HERSELF.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.625
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

14:52.667 --> 14:55.000
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO ANYONE FOR ANYTHING.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.083
SHE'S GETTING ON WITH HER LIFE
THE BEST WAY SHE CAN.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.041
SHE'S READY TO SPEND TIME
WITH HER SON.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.542
I DON'T SEE WHY
WE AREN'T ALL SUPPORTING HER.

15:01.583 --> 15:05.041
SO VIOLET TALKS TO YOU ABOUT
WANTING TO BE WITH LUCAS,

15:05.083 --> 15:08.000
SHOWS YOU PHOTOS OF HIM,
TALKS ABOUT MILESTONES?
MILESTONES? GOD, NO.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.792
VIOLET AND I ARE FRIENDS 'CAUSE
SHE ISN'T THAT KIND OF MOTHER.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.750
I HATE BABIES. SO DOES SHE.

15:13.792 --> 15:17.542
I MEAN... WE DON'T LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE'S BABIES.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.041
BUT SHE LIKES LUCAS.

15:19.083 --> 15:22.792
SHE DOES. SHE LOVES HIM.

15:25.875 --> 15:29.417
(indistinct conversations)

15:29.458 --> 15:33.041
VIOLET HATES BABIES.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.041
REALLY?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.583
AFTER WHAT YOU SAID,

15:36.625 --> 15:40.667
YOU'RE COMING TO DISCUSS
MY TESTIMONY?

15:40.709 --> 15:42.166
SHE WAS COUNTING ON US.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.166
AT LEAST
I TRIED TO BE LOYAL.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.667
I KNOW I MESSED IT UP,
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

15:46.709 --> 15:49.583
SO DON'T YOU COME AND TRY
TO PUSH YOUR GUILT ON TO ME.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.583
I'M NOT TAKING ANY OF IT.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.834
WHY DON'T YOU STUFF IT
WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE?

15:54.875 --> 15:56.959
(woman) DO YOU THINK
ADDISON MONTGOMERY

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
IS A GOOD INFLUENCE
IN LUCAS' LIFE?

16:01.500 --> 16:04.500
I NEED A VERBAL ANSWER,
DR. BENNETT.

16:04.542 --> 16:07.625
I-I DON'T KNOW.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER WITH LUCAS?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.834
YES.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.500
HAVE YOU SEEN HER FEEDING HIM
AND BATHING HIM,

16:11.542 --> 16:13.625
PLAYING WITH HIM?
YES.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.750
DOES SHE SEEM COMFORTABLE?

16:15.792 --> 16:17.542
ENOUGH.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.542
DR. BENNETT, CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY REASONS

16:21.583 --> 16:23.291
WHY ADDISON MONTGOMERY

16:23.333 --> 16:27.834
MIGHT NOT BE
A GOOD INFLUENCE ON LUCAS...

16:27.875 --> 16:32.041
OR REASONS WHY
VIOLET TURNER WOULD BE?

16:33.917 --> 16:35.041
DR. BENNETT,

16:35.083 --> 16:39.667
SHE ASKS, YOU RESPOND.

16:39.709 --> 16:41.625
RIGHT.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.792
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOUR HONOR?
WE'RE DONE HERE.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.875
SAM.

16:49.917 --> 16:52.000
SAM, WHAT WAS THAT?

16:52.041 --> 16:55.041
THEY ASKED ME QUESTIONS,
AND I ANSWERED.
THAT WAS IT? THAT WAS
ALL YOU HAD TO GIVE?

16:55.083 --> 16:57.041
YOU KNOW
THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.
I COULDN'T.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.041
YOU SHOULD'VE GOTTEN UP THERE--
I-I WANTED TO...

16:59.083 --> 17:01.125
WELL, WHY NOT?
AND I-I COULDN'T.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.542
B-BECAUSE OF ME? BECAUSE YOU--
I'M IN LOVE WITH ADDISON.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.542
I LOVE HER, AND AT THE SAME
TIME, I HATE HER.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.709
SEEING HER WITH PETE
IS KILLING ME.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.709
LAST NIGHT,
I WAS OUT ON MY DECK,

17:09.750 --> 17:12.083
AND I COULD HEAR ALL THREE
OF THEM NEXT DOOR.

17:12.125 --> 17:15.083
AND LUCAS WAS LAUGHING, AND IF
I HAD GOTTEN UP ON THE STAND

17:15.125 --> 17:17.083
AND SAID
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY...

17:17.125 --> 17:19.083
I WANT TO TEAR THEM APART.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.542
I WANT TO TAKE THAT BABY
AWAY FROM THEM.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.041
BUT IT'S FOR
THE WRONG REASONS.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.041
SO I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

17:25.083 --> 17:28.041
BUT I-I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK MYSELF IN THE MIRROR

17:28.083 --> 17:30.041
AND KNOW THAT I'M A GOOD MAN.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.041
I'M TRYING TO BE A GOOD MAN.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.625
SO I SAID NOTHING...

17:35.667 --> 17:39.333
BECAUSE IF I HAD SAID
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY,

17:39.375 --> 17:42.333
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
TESTIFYING FOR YOU.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.041
I WOULD'VE BEEN TESTIFYING
FOR ME.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.041
(Broome) DR. TURNER,

17:47.083 --> 17:50.333
IF YOU WIN, IF PARTIAL CUSTODY
IS GRANTED TO YOU,

17:50.375 --> 17:54.041
WHAT DO YOU
LOOK FORWARD TO WITH LUCAS?

17:54.083 --> 17:57.417
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FORWARD TO?

17:57.458 --> 17:59.333
I... (chuckles)

17:59.375 --> 18:01.583
I CAN'T WAIT
TO WATCH HIM SLEEP AGAIN.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.875
AFTER HE WAS BORN, UH,
B-BEFORE I GAVE HIM TO PETE,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.875
I USED TO WATCH HIM SLEEP,
AND HE JUST...

18:06.917 --> 18:08.917
HE LOOKED SO PEACEFUL.

18:08.959 --> 18:10.709
AND, UH...

18:10.750 --> 18:13.375
WELL, NOW HE'S TRYING TO WALK
AND FORM WORDS

18:13.417 --> 18:16.917
AND, UM... AND I WANT TO BE
A PART OF ALL THAT.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.667
I DON'T WANNA...

18:18.709 --> 18:21.375
I DON'T WANNA MISS
ANYTHING ELSE.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.792
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
A MINUTE...

18:23.834 --> 18:25.709
GET SOME WATER?

18:25.750 --> 18:28.000
NO, I'M OKAY.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.166
SO YOU'RE GLAD YOU HAD LUCAS.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.875
'CAUSE YOU DID THINK ABOUT
ABORTING HIM, DIDN'T YOU?

18:32.917 --> 18:36.041
JUST LIKE YOU ABORTED A NUMBER
OF OTHER BABIES, RIGHT?

18:42.792 --> 18:44.041
(Addison) ME. THAT'S ME.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.750
HERE. ME.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.041
(speaks indistinctly)

18:48.083 --> 18:49.667
WHAT IF I LOSE?

18:49.709 --> 18:51.041
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE.
WE.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.041
WHAT IF I LOSE?

18:53.083 --> 18:55.041
"WE. WE."
WHAT IF WE LOSE?
WHAT IF WE LOSE?

18:55.083 --> 18:57.041
IT'S NOT LOSING ANYWAY,
ALL RIGHT?

18:57.083 --> 19:00.041
VIOLET IS LUCAS' MOM. IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S GONNA HURT HIM.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.041
IT'S NOT LIKE I SAID SHE WAS
GONNA DROWN HIM IN THE BATHTUB.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S PAST HIS BEDTIME.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.917
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN ASLEEP,
LIKE, A HALF-HOUR AGO.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.083
I'M GONNA PUT HIM DOWN, OKAY?
(doorbell rings)

19:09.125 --> 19:12.083
IT'S JUST--WE DON'T NEED HER,
THIS. WE DON'T NEED THIS.
CAN YOU, UH,
GET THE DOOR, PLEASE?

19:12.125 --> 19:14.083
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. READY?
SAY GOOD NIGHT.

19:14.125 --> 19:15.875
GOOD NIGHT.
SAY NIGHT-NIGHT.

19:15.917 --> 19:18.000
NIGHT, BIG MAN.
NIGHT-NIGHT, DADDY.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.709
I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE FIRST,
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.875
SO I FIGURED,
I MEAN, ADDISON'S, IT--

19:28.917 --> 19:31.041
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S LATE
AND MY LAWYER WOULD...

19:31.083 --> 19:34.750
(clears throat) BE UPSET IF SHE
KNEW THAT I WAS HERE, BUT--
WHAT?

19:34.792 --> 19:37.250
H-HOW DID WE GET HERE,
PETE?

19:37.291 --> 19:39.500
I MEAN, HERE, IN COURT.

19:39.542 --> 19:42.041
YOU SUED ME.
I KNOW THAT, BUT ISN'T...

19:42.083 --> 19:44.709
ISN'T THERE A MORE CIVIL WAY
OF DOING THIS?

19:44.750 --> 19:47.709
YOUR LAWYER KNOWS ALL THESE
PERSONAL THINGS ABOUT EVERYONE.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.834
SO DOES YOURS.
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING,
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

19:50.875 --> 19:52.917
VIOLET, YOU PUT LUCAS
IN MY ARMS

19:52.959 --> 19:55.083
AND MADE ME SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS WELL-BEING.

19:55.125 --> 19:58.083
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I THINK
IS RIGHT FOR HIM.
REALLY?

19:58.125 --> 20:01.291
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE...

20:01.333 --> 20:03.291
THE WAY--
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME,

20:03.333 --> 20:06.542
IT FEELS LIKE PUNISHMENT,
LIKE YOU ARE PUNISHING ME.
THAT'S NOT MY INTENTION.

20:06.583 --> 20:09.041
WELL, SAM SAID A THING.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.041
HE SAID THAT HE LOVES ADDISON,
BUT THAT HE HATES ADDISON.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.834
SO IT MAKES IT HARD
FOR HIM TO...

20:14.875 --> 20:17.750
LOOK, CLEARLY, YOU HATE ME.

20:17.792 --> 20:22.000
BUT ARE--ARE YOU
DOING ALL THIS BECAUSE...

20:24.083 --> 20:27.583
(sighs) ARE YOU STILL
IN LOVE WITH ME?

20:34.083 --> 20:36.208
(indistinct conversations)

20:36.250 --> 20:37.792
VIOLET.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.583
LEAVE ME ALONE.
HEY, HEY, COME ON. COME HERE.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.041
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?
WHAT?

20:43.083 --> 20:45.041
FELLAS, KEEP IT TOGETHER.
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

20:45.083 --> 20:48.542
NO, SCREW THAT. DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT YOU JUST DID?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.542
THAT'S CRAP, COOPER.
I HAVE A DAUGHTER, OKAY?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.959
THAT'S CRAP.
WHERE IS SHE?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
INSIDE. HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GIVE HER A MINUTE?

20:56.041 --> 20:57.166
YOU OKAY?

20:57.208 --> 20:59.041
(sighs)

20:59.083 --> 21:01.417
(exhales)

21:02.917 --> 21:05.834
YOU WANT ME TO FIRE COOPER?
(laughs)

21:05.875 --> 21:07.834
'CAUSE I CAN.
I'LL FIRE CHARLOTTE.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.041
I BEEN LOOKING FOR A REASON
TO FIRE CHARLOTTE.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.041
SAY THE WORD,
AND I WILL.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.583
(sighs)

21:14.625 --> 21:16.375
WHO KNEW?

21:16.417 --> 21:20.250
WHO KNEW THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT
I WAS SUCH A HORRIBLE PERSON?

21:20.291 --> 21:23.041
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF I LOSE?

21:23.083 --> 21:26.000
I CAN'T
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.709
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL
A PATIENT

21:31.750 --> 21:34.000
IF SHE WERE
GOING THROUGH THIS?

21:36.250 --> 21:37.959
I DON'T KNOW.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.208
COME ON. YEAH, YOU DO.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.458
YEAH, YOU DO.

21:47.166 --> 21:50.458
(whispers)
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH PETE.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.041
(sighs)

21:53.083 --> 21:55.625
(normal voice)
DON'T TELL ANYONE. OKAY?

21:55.667 --> 21:58.417
OKAY.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.291
(Ellen) OKAY, LET'S GO BACK.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.041
LET'S GO BACK.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.041
AT WHAT POINT DURING THE ATTACK
DID YOUR MIND DRIFT TO LUCAS?

22:05.083 --> 22:08.000
WHY IS THIS SIGNIFICANT?
BECAUSE WE'VE RECOUNTED THIS
NUMEROUS TIMES,

22:08.041 --> 22:10.000
AND AT NO POINT
HAVE YOU MENTIONED YOUR BABY,

22:10.041 --> 22:11.959
NOT ONCE, AND I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HIM.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.542
OKAY, SO LET'S GO BACK.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.041
YOU'RE ON THE FLOOR--
WELL, BLOOD WAS POURING
OUT OF MY BODY

22:16.083 --> 22:19.917
AND I WAS RUINING THE RUG.
I DON'T KNOW.
STICK WITH ME, VIOLET.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.542
(sighs)

22:21.583 --> 22:24.959
JUST STAY WITH ME.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.333
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I BEGGED HER NOT TO DO IT?

22:29.375 --> 22:33.000
DO WHAT?

22:33.041 --> 22:37.375
TO CUT HIM OUT OF ME.

22:37.417 --> 22:40.417
(indistinct conversations)

22:44.417 --> 22:47.166
NAI, DO YOU MIND
IF I SIT?

22:49.000 --> 22:49.959
(exhales)

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY, NO?

22:59.750 --> 23:03.041
(sighs) HOW DID WE GET HERE?

23:03.083 --> 23:05.041
HOW DID WE
LET IT GET THIS BAD?

23:11.083 --> 23:14.000
I DON'T KNOW.

23:19.625 --> 23:22.041
YOU LIKE PLAYING HOUSE
WITH MY SON, ADDISON?
VIOLET--

23:22.083 --> 23:24.583
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
WHO KNEW ABOUT MY ABORTIONS,

23:24.625 --> 23:27.041
AND I AM SURE NAOMI
WAS NOT THE ONE WHO TOLD.

23:27.083 --> 23:29.041
I--
YOU WANT TO FIGHT DIRTY?
LET'S FIGHT DIRTY.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.041
BUT YOU STARTED IT.
(chuckles)

23:31.083 --> 23:33.792
REMEMBER THAT
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE STAND.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.041
(Broome) DO YOU BELIEVE

23:39.083 --> 23:41.750
THAT VIOLET TURNER
IS A FIT MOTHER?

23:41.792 --> 23:45.041
PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.417
NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE

23:46.458 --> 23:48.834
THAT VIOLET TURNER
IS A FIT MOTHER.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.041
SHE'S MADE NO CONTACT
WITH THE BABY.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.041
I'VE TRIED TO FILL THAT VOID.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.458
I KNOW I'M NOT HIS MOTHER.
I DIDN'T, UH...

23:55.500 --> 23:59.083
IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO,
BUT IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED,

23:59.125 --> 24:01.375
AND, UM...
I-I'M GLAD THAT IT DID.

24:01.417 --> 24:04.458
HE'S A VERY SPECIAL
LITTLE BOY.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.875
WELL, I COMMEND YOU,
DR. MONTGOMERY.

24:06.917 --> 24:09.291
NOT MANY WOMEN WOULD TAKE ON
THE RESPONSIBILITY

24:09.333 --> 24:11.166
OF RAISING
ANOTHER WOMAN'S CHILD.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.041
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.041
WOULD YOU CALL YOURSELF

24:15.083 --> 24:17.041
AN HONEST PERSON,
DR. MONTGOMERY?

24:17.083 --> 24:19.250
YES, I WOULD.
YOU WERE MARRIED, RIGHT?

24:19.291 --> 24:22.041
YES, I WAS.
I'M--I'M DIVORCED NOW.

24:22.083 --> 24:25.041
AND WHY DID
YOUR MARRIAGE DISSOLVE?
OBJECTION.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.333
WHY IS DR. MONTGOMERY'S
MARRIAGE RELEVANT?
WELL?

24:27.375 --> 24:29.333
IT GOES TO HER CREDIBILITY,
YOUR HONOR.

24:29.375 --> 24:32.041
ANSWER, DR. MONTGOMERY.

24:32.083 --> 24:35.834
I, UH... HAD AN AFFAIR,
AND MY HUSBAND LEFT ME.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.834
AND WHO DID YOU
HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH?

24:38.875 --> 24:40.834
HE WAS
MY HUSBAND'S BEST FRIEND.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.834
DIDN'T YOU ALSO HAVE AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR PATIENT'S HUSBAND,

24:43.875 --> 24:47.083
A, UH...
DR. NOAH BARNES, I BELIEVE--

24:47.125 --> 24:49.041
WE NEVER SLEPT TOGETHER.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.041
OKAY,
SO YOU'VE BEEN DISHONEST,

24:51.083 --> 24:54.041
BROKEN YOUR VOWS WHEN IT
SERVED YOU, HAVEN'T YOU?

24:54.083 --> 24:56.041
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,

24:56.083 --> 24:59.875
HOW MUCH TRUST CAN WE PUT IN
YOUR CREDIBILITY HERE TODAY?

24:59.917 --> 25:02.667
OBJECTION. SERIOUSLY,
THIS IS ABUSIVE.
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.917
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE CHILDREN,
DR. MONTGOMERY?

25:09.291 --> 25:10.959
I CAN'T.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.959
DID YOU EVER
WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.041
YES, I TRIED,
BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.667
SO WOULD YOU LIE ON THE STAND
TO KEEP LUCAS,

25:18.709 --> 25:21.875
TO PROTECT YOUR
ONE LAST CHANCE AT MOTHERHOOD?

25:21.917 --> 25:23.500
OBJECTION.

25:23.542 --> 25:25.041
NO, I WANT TO ANSWER.

25:25.083 --> 25:28.041
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M A CHEATER
AND A HUSBAND STEALER,

25:28.083 --> 25:30.041
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT,
I'M BARREN.

25:30.083 --> 25:33.041
SO GOOD TIMES. I...

25:33.083 --> 25:35.500
I NEVER WANTED
ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

25:35.542 --> 25:37.917
I NEVER
WANTED TO HURT VIOLET.

25:37.959 --> 25:40.166
YES, SHE'S A MESS.
I'M A MESS, TOO.

25:40.208 --> 25:43.709
I... I'M HERE FOR LUCAS.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.083
HE'S A BABY, SO HE CAN'T
SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.083
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
IF HE COULD,

25:48.125 --> 25:51.083
HE'D SAY THAT HE WANTED
TO FEEL LOVED AND SAFE

25:51.125 --> 25:54.750
AND HAVE CEREAL FOR DINNER.

25:54.792 --> 25:57.041
I JUST WANT LUCAS
TO BE HAPPY.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.041
SO IF THAT MEANS
YOU TEARING ME APART

25:59.083 --> 26:01.709
AND MAKING ME LOOK LIKE THE MOST
HORRIBLE PERSON ON EARTH,

26:01.750 --> 26:03.625
THEN PLEASE,
GO AHEAD AND DO IT,

26:03.667 --> 26:05.125
BECAUSE...

26:05.166 --> 26:08.041
LUCAS IS WORTH IT... TO ME.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.041
SO...

26:10.083 --> 26:14.625
NEXT QUESTION... MS. GIBSON?

26:14.667 --> 26:17.000
(Violet)
ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH ME?

26:21.166 --> 26:24.834
I'M SORRY...

26:24.875 --> 26:28.250
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING
HAS HURT YOU.

26:28.291 --> 26:31.291
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU HURT LUCAS
THE WAY YOU HURT ME.

26:31.333 --> 26:34.166
I HAVE TO PROTECT HIM.
YOU--YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.291
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM ME?
I DON'T KNOW.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.291
I-I MEAN,
WE MADE A BABY TOGETHER.

26:38.333 --> 26:41.041
I MEAN, THE LEAST WE COULD
OFFER EACH OTHER IS HONESTY.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.667
HONEST? FINE. I'M DONE.

26:42.709 --> 26:45.041
I HAVE MOVED ON.
I'M OVER YOU.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.041
I WISH YOU WELL. BEST OF LUCK
IN ALL YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.417
YOU'VE RIPPED MY HEART OUT

26:49.458 --> 26:51.792
AND YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM OUR CHILD.

26:51.834 --> 26:55.208
I HAVE MOVED ON.
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

26:57.875 --> 27:01.250
YOU WANT ME TO BE HONEST?

27:01.291 --> 27:04.041
HONESTY ISN'T NICE.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.625
(footsteps approach)

27:14.667 --> 27:17.041
YOU WERE FANTASTIC
ON THE STAND TODAY.

27:17.083 --> 27:20.417
IF THAT DOESN'T WIN IT
FOR US, I DON'T KNOW...

27:20.458 --> 27:22.041
IS THE BABY ASLEEP?

27:22.083 --> 27:24.041
WHAT?
IS LUCAS ASLEEP?

27:24.083 --> 27:26.041
YEAH, HE WENT DOWN FINE.

27:26.083 --> 27:27.208
(exhales deeply)

27:27.250 --> 27:31.709
HOW DID YOUR LAWYERS KNOW
ABOUT VIOLET'S ABORTIONS?

27:35.083 --> 27:37.458
ANSWER ME.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.917
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO HELP US WIN.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.458
(scoffs) I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.
WH--

27:42.500 --> 27:44.959
PETE, I DON'T KNOW.
ADDISON,
WHY DON'T YOU START--

27:45.000 --> 27:47.041
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE YOU--YOU HAVE DONE

27:47.083 --> 27:49.583
SOME HORRIBLE THINGS DURING
THIS TRIAL, BUT I TOLD MYSELF

27:49.625 --> 27:51.959
IT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
WORRIED AND YOU'RE SCARED.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.750
BUT NOW--NOW IT'S LIKE
YOU'VE SHUT DOWN PETE

27:54.792 --> 27:57.041
AND BECOME THIS
COLD, HARD, MEAN--
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.041
MIND MY OWN BUSINESS?
YEAH, STAY OUTTA THIS.

27:59.083 --> 28:01.166
THIS IS MY BUSINESS.
YOU MADE IT MY BUSINESS

28:01.208 --> 28:03.333
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR SON
IN MY ARMS.

28:03.375 --> 28:06.041
IF I DIDN'T LOVE THAT KID,
I'D SIT BACK

28:06.083 --> 28:09.041
AND I'D WATCH YOU AND VIOLET
TEAR EACH OTHER TO SHREDS.

28:09.083 --> 28:12.000
BUT I DO LOVE HIM, AND THAT IS
WHO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HERE.
AND I'M NOT?

28:12.041 --> 28:14.542
YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY TO HIM

28:14.583 --> 28:17.542
WHEN HE ASKS YOU ONE DAY, "WHY
DID YOU DO THIS TO MY MOTHER?"

28:17.583 --> 28:19.542
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

28:19.583 --> 28:22.041
I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SOMETHING GOOD TO SAY, PETE,

28:22.083 --> 28:25.000
OR ELSE OTHERWISE, HE'S GONNA--
WHAT, WHAT,
HE'S GONNA HATE ME?

28:25.041 --> 28:28.792
NO, HE IS GONNA BE ASHAMED
OF YOU, LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.125
(Cooper) PETE...

28:30.166 --> 28:31.792
WHY ARE WE HERE?

28:31.834 --> 28:34.291
I MEAN, ALL WE EVER WANTED
SINCE LUCAS WAS BORN

28:34.333 --> 28:36.291
WAS FOR VIOLET TO BE
A PART OF HIS LIFE.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.000
HOW MANY TIMES DID SHE WALK OUT
OF A ROOM THAT HE WAS IN?

28:39.041 --> 28:41.041
HOW MANY TIMES DID SHE WALK
AROUND HIM OR BY HIM

28:41.083 --> 28:43.208
OR PRETEND
THAT LUCAS DIDN'T EXIST?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.417
AND EVERY TIME, YOU AND I,
WE'D RUN INTO A CORNER

28:45.458 --> 28:47.542
AND HAVE
A HUSHED CONVERSATION,

28:47.583 --> 28:50.041
HOPING AND PRAYING THAT SHE
WOULD JUST LOOK AT HIM.
EXACTLY. THAT'S--

28:50.083 --> 28:52.000
OKAY, BUT SHE DID.
SHE LOOKED AT HIM.

28:52.041 --> 28:55.041
YOU KNOW, VIOLET DID
WHAT WE ALL ASKED OF HER,

28:55.083 --> 28:58.041
AND INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING HER
OR BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF,

28:58.083 --> 28:59.750
BECAUSE, YEAH,
IT'S ABOUT TIME...

28:59.792 --> 29:01.041
WE'RE IN COURT, YOU KNOW,

29:01.083 --> 29:04.041
TELLING HER, "NO, VIOLET, YOU
CAN'T BE A MOTHER TO YOUR SON."

29:04.083 --> 29:06.166
IT'S A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:06.208 --> 29:07.959
COOPER, SHE'S NOT READY.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.041
DEEP DOWN,
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.041
(Broome) DO YOU BELIEVE

29:12.083 --> 29:15.000
THAT VIOLET TURNER
IS A FIT MOTHER?

29:22.875 --> 29:24.083
DR. FREEDMAN?

29:26.625 --> 29:28.875
(judge) ANSWER THE QUESTION,
DR. FREEDMAN.

29:30.834 --> 29:33.333
(clears throat) NO, I DON'T.

29:35.333 --> 29:38.041
VIOLET...

29:38.083 --> 29:39.458
VIOLET, I SHOULD'VE...

29:39.500 --> 29:41.458
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
HOW I WAS FEELING.
