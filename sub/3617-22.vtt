WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:08.868
I am really glad
Elise made me call you.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.235
You're exactly the kind
of guy I've been looking for.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.915
- Is that so?
- Oh, it is "so" so.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.036
You're cute,
you're sweet, you're smart.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.988
And from what I hear,
you're raking in the dough.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.469
Well, you have quite the way
with words, don't you?

00:25.640 --> 00:29.519
Yeah, well when it comes to
helping needy children, I'm shameless.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.356
Come on, Evan, please do the
charity auction. It'll be fun.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.956
It'll be fun to be auctioned
off like a side of beef.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.233
Yeah, well, it's not like we're
asking you to marry the highest bidder.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.679
It's just, you know, one little date
and one little tax-deductible donation,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.195
you know, to match your lady's bid.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.557
Is there any chance "Ask Phoebe"
will be doing some bidding?

00:55.960 --> 00:59.999
Well, you'll just have to
sign up to find that out.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.909
Then I graduated from
Stanford Law in '98.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.549
Harvard Law.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.039
That's impressive.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.918
So do you want to
give to a charity or what?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.798
I said Stanford, not Harvard.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.077
Let me ask you something.
Have you been having any kind of

01:18.240 --> 01:21.630
end-of-the-world, fire-and-brimstone
doomsday kind of dreams lately?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.189
Wait a minute. Is this
some sort of religious charity?

01:25.240 --> 01:27.959
No, it's not, it's for children.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.116
Right.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.277
Hey, to each his own.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.675
But I'm not into the
whole fire-and-brimstone thing.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.755
Paige, you're supposed to be flirting
with the bachelors,

01:37.920 --> 01:39.956
- not frightening them.
- I'm sorry.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.872
I guess I'm just a little off.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.072
My boyfriend moved to Hong Kong.
I'm thoroughly depressed.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.516
But I still managed to
sign up six people and you have...

01:48.680 --> 01:52.389
- I have none people.
- None people.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.438
Paige, I know you've been in a bad
mood, but this is getting a little crazy.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.559
What? I barely slept all week,
I keep having these strange dreams

01:59.720 --> 02:02.837
about ancient wars
and weird magic...

02:03.000 --> 02:04.638
It's all very disturbing.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.075
- Do you think they mean something?
- I don't know.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.832
It could be hormones.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.752
More likely it could be
my subconscious

02:10.919 --> 02:12.751
trying to tell me something.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.760 --> 03:08.718
It worked! You're alive!

03:16.440 --> 03:20.149
- How long?
- How long?

03:20.320 --> 03:22.276
Three thousand years,
give or take a century.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.112
What?

03:28.560 --> 03:31.757
- Who are you?
- Me?

03:31.920 --> 03:36.710
I'm the demon who spent
decades trying to free you!

03:36.880 --> 03:40.031
Now you're gonna return the favour.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.749
It wasn't easy either.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.753
The world's forgotten about you.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.475
But I had a vision.
If I could somehow revive you,

03:50.640 --> 03:55.350
I could use your power
to bring myself to glory.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.870
Rule the underworld
as I was always meant to!

04:05.880 --> 04:08.314
Lmbecile.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.678
Oh, I love it when you
smite so unexpectedly.

04:20.839 --> 04:25.311
We have to find
Cronus and free him as well.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.075
Do we have to?
You know he'll be furious.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.277
I am counting on it.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.592
For the love that is
everything good and pure

06:27.760 --> 06:30.513
why have we never
bothered to get air conditioning?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.432
Because we live in San Francisco

06:32.600 --> 06:35.831
where the temperature
rarely goes above 75 degrees.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.032
Okay, well, it's at 90 now,
can we get one today, please?

06:39.240 --> 06:44.837
Yeah, we could, if it was
not for this little expenditure here.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.196
Yeah, that's a lot of phone
calls to Hong Kong.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.554
Yes, it is.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.598
Okay, before you start yelling,
let me just explain to you

06:55.800 --> 06:58.633
that I'm trying to figure out where
Jason and I stand and to do that

06:58.800 --> 07:00.279
it requires a lot of phone calls.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.351
You're gonna throw that
glass at me, aren't you?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.078
No, honey, I get it.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.595
You know, it is a very big phone bill.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.793
But if you have to choose between
true love and air conditioning

07:10.960 --> 07:12.598
I'd say it's a no-brainer.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.791
Who are you and what
have you done to my sister?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.150
What, I can't be in a good mood?

07:17.320 --> 07:21.029
No, Mary Poppins wouldn't be
in a good mood in this kind of heat.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.350
Well, Wyatt is finally
sleeping through the night

07:23.520 --> 07:25.715
and my hormones
are back in whack

07:25.880 --> 07:28.189
and you know,
Leo and I are finally...

07:28.400 --> 07:31.790
- Back in the saddle?
- So to speak.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.719
Yay, you!
God, I miss sex!

07:34.880 --> 07:37.838
I gotta tell you, life is feeling
pretty damn good at the moment.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.639
So where is your lucky
husband and my perfect nephew?

07:40.800 --> 07:43.837
They are shopping for
a present for Darryl's son.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.037
Look at you.
You're like soccer mom.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.590
Dare I say it,
your life is almost normal?

07:50.760 --> 07:53.399
There is nothing
normal about this heat.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.993
Good morning, sunshine.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.435
Oh, save the quips
and pass the caffeine.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.033
I have work to do.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.556
Are you gonna scry for Mother Nature
and have a Wiccan word with her?

08:02.720 --> 08:05.154
Okay, you're way too perky,
all right?

08:05.320 --> 08:07.117
And you're frightening me.
I'm just saying.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.998
So you think this
weather's demonic?

08:09.160 --> 08:11.276
I don't know,
there's just something weird.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.869
I keep waking up all week
long with these fiery dreams.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.230
What am I supposed to think?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.630
You're not getting a God
complex or something, are you?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.119
They've got medication for that.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.716
I didn't say my dreams
caused it, I'm just...

08:23.880 --> 08:25.518
I don't know what I'm saying.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.870
Honey, maybe you need to
get out a little more.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.032
Well, this isn't just
me being obsessive.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.034
Okay, maybe a little bit, but it's
not just psychological or emotional,

08:35.200 --> 08:37.509
I really, really think
there's something...

08:37.679 --> 08:39.796
Magical?

08:39.960 --> 08:42.076
Yeah, for lack of a better term.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.834
Listen, I don't wanna be a downer,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.515
but I'm gonna go hit the <i>Book</i> so I can
figure out what the hell is going on.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.236
- Should we be worried?
- I don't think so.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.590
But I just wish she'd
stop looking for trouble.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.716
Because with our luck,
she's gonna find it.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.312
There he is, as wrathful as ever.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.516
All the more reason to leave him be.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.352
Careful, Meta.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.273
Demetrius, I'm telling
you we don't need him.

09:21.480 --> 09:25.871
We have more than enough power
to rule without him, you know that.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.153
Just imagine,
a new plague every day.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.471
A monsoon every week.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.875
It will be devastating.

09:37.320 --> 09:42.075
Nevertheless, we will need his
strength to revenge our captors...

09:42.240 --> 09:44.071
...and that is something we all want.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.549
Oh, now, don't pout, Meta.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.876
You might start a hurricane.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.315
And alert them.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.277
Now, go and find the whitelighters.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.952
It won't be long before I free Cronus.
You know how impatient he can get.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.719
Daddy, Daddy, show us your trick!

10:31.880 --> 10:34.952
Trick? I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:35.120 --> 10:39.432
Hold on a second. Wait,
you have something in your ear.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.711
I do?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.438
Yeah.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.992
You call that magic?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.594
Okay, who wants hot dogs?

10:55.560 --> 10:58.632
Let me guess, first time
the baby slept all night, huh?

10:58.800 --> 10:59.994
How'd you know?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.594
First few months after Mikey
was born were rough, you know.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.830
No sleep, no time for each other.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.194
That sounds familiar.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.592
Yeah, but right about three or four
months, things start to level off.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.588
- Really good again.
- Till he hits 2.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.360
Oh, don't scare them.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.916
Piper, I have to go.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.596
- But we just got here.
- I know, baby, but it's the Elders.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.870
Don't worry, she knows.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.349
Your secret's safe with me.
Argue away.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.395
Honey, I'm sorry,
but it sounds urgent.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.031
Okay, well, then I need
to express to you

11:40.200 --> 11:42.998
that this is gonna make
me feel a little abandoned.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.998
All right, well, I understand.

11:45.160 --> 11:49.790
I acknowledge your feelings and
I want to let you know that I love you,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.838
even though I have to go.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.719
- Darryl, stop.
- What's so funny?

11:55.880 --> 11:58.952
Nothing, just...
Marriage counselling, huh?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.273
Honey, we did it too.
We recognize the tools.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.630
I think I hate the tools.
I'd rather just snipe later

12:05.800 --> 12:09.315
than be open and honest
about my feelings now.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.277
Yeah, we felt the same way.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.352
But you know what?
Turns out the tools really helped.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.078
- Piper, I have to go.
- Fine, go.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.516
I mean, thank you
for considering my feelings,

12:22.680 --> 12:25.399
and I love you and I will
see you later at home.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.073
Okay.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.837
Very good.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.354
So you'll introduce
the bachelors from here

12:41.520 --> 12:43.795
and then they'll enter from over there.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.477
- Phoebe, you with me?
- I am all over him.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.511
I mean it, all over it.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.434
Phoebe, the newspaper only
sponsors one charity event a year,

12:53.640 --> 12:55.437
and I want this to
go off without a hitch.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.397
It will, I promise.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.198
Okay, that's what I like to hear.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.033
Oh, and please thank your
sister again for donating her club.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.192
I just hope everyone doesn't melt
by the time they get here.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.557
It's gonna be kind of hard
to auction off bachelor soup.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.075
It is bizarre weather, isn't it?

13:11.280 --> 13:15.034
I spoke to Jason this morning and he
says it's the same way in Hong Kong.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.111
You spoke to Jason?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.433
Did he mention me?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.834
Look, not that it's
any of my business...

13:24.000 --> 13:25.956
...but are you sure you
wanna tether yourself

13:26.120 --> 13:27.997
to a boyfriend who's
halfway across the world?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.149
I know.

13:29.320 --> 13:33.632
And the truth is, this heat is
kind of making me a little boy-crazy.

13:34.120 --> 13:38.398
It just feels really weird to end
a good relationship so abruptly.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.199
- He's the one who moved away.
- I know.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.790
And at the risk of advising
an advice columnist...

13:44.960 --> 13:47.599
...I say you bid on a
bachelor or two tomorrow.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.995
That way I can live
vicariously through you.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.873
Oh, Elise, you brazen hussy!

13:56.080 --> 13:58.548
Oh, my God!

13:58.720 --> 14:01.678
- What, what is it?
- Nothing. Hold that thought.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.829
What thought?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.719
Paige, are you out of your mind?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.552
As it turns out, I am not.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.517
Listen, we are in big trouble.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.592
Yeah, you almost exposed
our magic to a room full of people.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.234
No, listen. I studied the I Ching,

14:15.400 --> 14:18.836
tarot cards, runes and tea leaves and
they're all giving me the same reading.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.718
That you need a good night's sleep?

14:20.880 --> 14:24.031
No, that there's something big
going on in the supernatural world.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.951
If my reading is right,
it's not just the thunder and the heat.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.270
We could be in store
for a big earthquake or worse.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.512
Okay, so what do you want us to do?
Do you have a plan?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.432
Not so much a plan as a location.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.160
I scryed for evil and one place
kept coming up red-hot.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.549
Take this. You're gonna need it.
We're going on a trip.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.950
Okay, there's a reason nobody
lives in this part of the world,

14:49.120 --> 14:52.192
and it's because
they all died from the cold.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.197
I thought you said
you wanted air conditioning.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.753
Oh, this sucks!

14:55.920 --> 14:57.751
Scorch mark, see if
you can get a premonition.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.558
I don't have my gloves!

14:59.760 --> 15:02.399
Tough it out, I got us this far.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.592
Okay, fine.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.754
- Did you get anything?
- Yeah, frostbite. Shush.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.870
- Oh, hot, hot, hot!
- Hot?

15:22.040 --> 15:23.951
No, not here hot.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.395
- In my vision.
- Vision? Good, tell me what it is.

15:27.440 --> 15:32.468
Two very large someones
coming out of that wall.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.395
- Who?
- I don't know.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.794
Demetrius.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.833
My lord.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.638
They did this to me.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.674
To me!

16:02.840 --> 16:05.991
- They will be punished.
- Punished?

16:06.160 --> 16:09.550
I will obliterate them!

16:18.520 --> 16:21.990
Earthquake. Did I call it or what?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.275
Did I mention this sucks?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.158
Yeah.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.478
I know it's cooled off a little bit since
this morning, but what are you doing?

16:40.760 --> 16:42.273
Defrosting.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.715
Is this them?

16:43.880 --> 16:45.438
- No.
- Who's them?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.033
We're not sure yet.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.191
- How was the party?
- Oh, just super fun.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.237
Leo got called away
and I got to use my tools.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.958
- What?
- Is that them?

16:53.120 --> 16:56.795
No, they looked a little
bit more... ancient.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.195
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.952
A whitelighter's disappeared.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.997
A whitelighter?
Like from a darklighter?

17:03.200 --> 17:05.395
No, a darklighter's poison
is slow and painful.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.079
This was more instantaneous,

17:07.240 --> 17:09.628
and the Elders have no
idea what it could have been.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.950
- It's all connected.
- What's connected?

17:12.119 --> 17:14.349
Whatever it is that
escaped from that ice cave.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.753
You were in an ice cave?

17:15.960 --> 17:17.757
The heat wave, the earthquake,
my dreams,

17:17.920 --> 17:19.751
this is bigger
than any one whitelighter.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.190
I better drop out
of that charity benefit.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.231
- Maybe we should cancel counselling.
- Hold it.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.393
Wait a minute. This is exactly what we
are supposed to be learning in therapy.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.471
When to put our lives on hold
and when not to.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.392
But, Piper, a whitelighter was killed.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.749
We don't know that.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.354
He could have just clipped
his wings and he's in hiding.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.755
- Is that possible?
- Yeah, I guess.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.758
Look, people, we just need to
manage our lives a little bit better.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.070
Dr. Barenson says that
needless worry and panic

17:44.240 --> 17:47.550
serve absolutely no purpose, except to
prevent the possibility of happiness.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.029
I am all for
the possibility of happiness.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.999
Good, so we need to address
the immediate problem at hand

17:53.160 --> 17:55.071
and circle the wagons
only when we have to.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.152
Leo, maybe you should get the Elders
to put a ban on whitelighters orbing

17:58.320 --> 18:00.390
until we figure out
exactly what's going on.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.755
Okay, I'll meet you at therapy.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.478
Okay, don't be late.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.517
Is it safe for you
to orb up there right now?

18:06.680 --> 18:09.240
Yeah. No worrying, remember?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.838
What's going on?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.951
What's with all the activity?
I just left here.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.270
- It's not your concern.
- Roland, please.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.271
Actually, we're not sure, Leo.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.516
But we do know that
something's not quite right.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.636
- Has another whitelighter been...?
- No.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.358
It's something else.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.075
Something we're not at liberty to
discuss outside the council of Elders.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.112
Anything to do with heat waves?
Earthquakes?

18:52.600 --> 18:53.749
What do you know?

18:53.920 --> 18:56.673
Not much, just that Paige has been
having these strange dreams lately.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.478
Dreams that seem pretty prophetic.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.995
You think she foresaw
these earthquakes?

19:01.160 --> 19:03.276
- Yes.
- That's not her power.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.550
It's not a power,
it's more of an instinct.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.154
An instinct?
That's what you're basing this on?

19:08.320 --> 19:10.754
Well, it hasn't let her down
so far, has it?

19:10.920 --> 19:14.310
Look, excuse me, but I've
just learned to rely on her instincts.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.879
All of their instincts.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.230
As well you should have, Leo.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.834
Now, what did you
come up here to tell us?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.639
Just that the girls think...

19:23.800 --> 19:25.791
...well, that we all think
that maybe we should

19:25.960 --> 19:29.270
ground all whitelighters
until we know for sure that it's safe.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.074
We agree.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.669
We'll initiate the orders
as soon as you've returned to them.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.473
In the meantime,
keep them working on this.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.029
It's important.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.838
You're worried, aren't you?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.837
You know me better than that.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.676
At the end of the day, even we
can't change what's meant to be.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.632
Just remember,
no matter what happens,

19:56.800 --> 19:59.837
you must always
follow your instincts too.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.309
Christa!

20:13.480 --> 20:15.277
It's about time
you came to heal your charge.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.234
Who are you? What do you want?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.311
A whitelighter.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.074
It's good to see you again, my lord.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.352
You never were a good liar, Meta.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.515
Where's the third one?

20:46.680 --> 20:50.355
Unfortunately, whitelighters are
not as easy to find in this time.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.669
Much has changed. Magic is
no longer practiced so openly.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.999
Much may have changed,
but you certainly haven't.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.352
You know, it always...

21:02.520 --> 21:04.875
...amazed me how someone...

21:05.080 --> 21:09.471
...as beautiful as you
could so easily turn a mortal to stone.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.956
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

21:15.760 --> 21:17.671
- She stays behind.
- No, she can't!

21:18.200 --> 21:19.838
We are stronger as three than two.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.877
We will need
every ounce of that strength

21:22.040 --> 21:23.792
if we are to take
revenge on our captors.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.072
But if we wait, we risk them
finding out we've been awakened.

21:27.240 --> 21:30.118
Then even with orbs,
we will not be able to break in.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.236
Then that is a risk
we will have to take.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.197
Says who?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.834
You, Demetrius?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.992
- Are you challenging me?
- No!

21:40.200 --> 21:43.192
No, of course he's not, Cronus.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.198
I've brought power
enough for both of you.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.791
You can take them and use them
to find a third whitelighter for me.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.952
And if we can't?

21:54.160 --> 22:00.269
Then I suppose I'll just
have to let you boys handle it.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.631
- Leo?
- Sorry, honey.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.392
I was starting to get
worried about you.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.195
I know, I know,
I came as fast as I could.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.960
Well, what happened?
What took so long?

22:37.160 --> 22:39.913
I don't know.
They don't know.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.599
But we can talk about it later.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.552
Right now our first priority is us.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.439
Good answer, because I don't think
there's enough tools in the box

22:46.640 --> 22:48.198
to handle being stood up
at the shrink.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.191
No way. Are you kidding me?

22:51.480 --> 22:53.072
It sounds important.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.232
- But you were just there.
- I know.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.914
Look, I acknowledge that
this is very difficult for you.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.111
You know what, screw that!
Damn it!

23:05.040 --> 23:07.600
I'm just scared.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.636
But I told you it was
safe orbing up there.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.233
No, not about that.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.238
I'm scared that, you know,
every time something good happens,

23:15.400 --> 23:18.233
every time I actually think we
can have a normal life together,

23:18.400 --> 23:19.674
something goes wrong.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.070
Piper, I have to go.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.789
I know.
And I know it's not your fault.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.238
It's just the way that it is.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.395
I love you.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.714
Phoebe!

23:47.880 --> 23:49.438
Hey, Phoebe!

23:51.240 --> 23:54.038
- Did you find something?
- Do "Titans" ring a bell?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.714
Titans, like from ancient Greece?
You have got to be kidding me.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.154
Ancient gods who were entombed

23:58.320 --> 24:00.231
because it was
the only way to stop them.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.710
Okay, well, even if it is them,
how did they get out?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.070
- And why go after the whitelighters?
- I don't know.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.272
Maybe one of them was hurt,
maybe they needed healing powers.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.113
I do know that because of
the Elders' no-orbing edict

24:12.320 --> 24:16.074
that the only way they're gonna
get another whitelighter is if one:

24:16.240 --> 24:19.073
Oh, no way, Paige.
Forget about it.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.549
Why not? If I'm right,
they will come right to us.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.915
Oh, and you're saying this
like it's a good thing?

24:24.080 --> 24:26.719
It is! This is why
I haven't been sleeping.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.916
This is what I've been
preparing for all year.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.640
I have got potions here
that are stronger

24:31.800 --> 24:34.314
than the ones
that we used on The Source.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.831
Okay, devil's advocate: Until we
figure out how powerful they are

24:38.040 --> 24:39.359
we shouldn't use you as bait.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.432
Witch's advocate: There are evil
gods running around on the loose

24:42.640 --> 24:44.790
that we should eliminate
before Wyatt gets home.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.188
That's dirty. Why do I feel like

24:46.360 --> 24:49.158
you're making me choose
between my sister and my nephew?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.078
Because you're slightly over-dramatic?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.992
I'm a little over-dramatic?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.593
Look, can we just do this, please?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.557
Okay, fine.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.792
Bring on the
earthquake-causing gods.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.996
Watch this.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.078
Don't look into her eyes!

25:35.040 --> 25:36.519
You all right?

25:41.200 --> 25:43.270
Oh, my God, Paige!

25:54.200 --> 25:56.270
Don't worry, she's all right.

25:57.160 --> 26:01.836
Well, I mean, she's not completely all
right, obviously, but she's not dead.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.439
Are you sure she's not?

26:03.640 --> 26:04.959
Frankly, you see this a lot.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.190
Museums, universities, town centres,

26:07.400 --> 26:10.437
most of those
statues aren't really statues.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.957
They're people like your sister
here who've been turned into stone.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.876
- Who are you?
- Chris.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.591
Chris Perry.
I'm... from the future.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.514
Oh, my God!

26:25.680 --> 26:29.150
Tell me that's just a really
good likeness of Paige.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.912
No, it's Paige.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.991
- A Titan turned her to stone.
- A who?

26:33.160 --> 26:35.230
- Who are you?
- That's Chris.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.716
- He's from the future.
- Yeah, but just like 20 years or so.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.392
- Friend or foe?
- I'm not so sure yet.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.755
What do you mean?
I saved Paige, didn't I?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.797
Oh, you call that saving, do you?

26:47.080 --> 26:49.071
Hey, I'm the one who
put my life on the line here.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.157
I didn't have to drop
everything I was doing

26:51.320 --> 26:52.958
just to orb in
and save her butt from...

26:53.120 --> 26:56.317
You...? You orb?
You're a whitelighter?

26:56.520 --> 26:58.556
Look, where I come from,

26:58.720 --> 27:01.473
history shows Paige didn't get
turned to stone on this day.

27:01.640 --> 27:02.709
She died.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.951
And with her death,
the power of three died too

27:06.120 --> 27:09.317
allowing Titans to rule and
create a world you don't wanna see.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.239
Trust me.
I'm here to alter history.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.918
- To help you save the future.
- Who sent you?

27:17.840 --> 27:20.070
- I can't answer that.
- Why not?

27:20.240 --> 27:21.309
Because anything I tell you

27:21.520 --> 27:23.829
could risk changing the future
in ways we don't want.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.155
Who's "we"?

27:25.320 --> 27:28.232
All I gotta say is that
if I hadn't gotten here when I did,

27:28.400 --> 27:30.436
Paige would've been
the third whitelighter victim.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.950
Wait, third?
I thought only one was missing.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.915
Not anymore.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.270
Leo? Leo!

27:40.400 --> 27:41.992
Honey, I'm sorry
I missed counselling but...

27:42.200 --> 27:44.111
Forget that,
we've got bigger problems.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.072
- What happened?
- Forget that too.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.559
How many
whitelighters are missing?

27:48.760 --> 27:50.318
- What?
- How many?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.318
Two, that's what
the Elders just called me for.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.832
Believe me now?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.632
Who's he?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.630
What was that?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.438
Sorry.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.678
We'll pay for that.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.158
So long as you can
keep the world from ending.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.669
It was a trap.
You were tricked.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.229
Still, there are other whitelighters.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.112
No, we have been discovered.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.475
Your incompetence
has endangered us all!

28:38.640 --> 28:40.710
My incompetence?

28:40.880 --> 28:43.348
I only went where I was told...

28:43.520 --> 28:44.509
...my lord.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.954
It doesn't matter.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.839
We can go back, they will be
no match for the three of us.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.834
Out of the question. We have to attack
our enemies now while we still can!

28:53.000 --> 28:54.718
I won't leave Meta behind.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.314
It's all right, Demetrius.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.948
You won't have to.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.559
No!

29:04.440 --> 29:05.793
Careful, Demetrius.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.871
Either you're with me...

29:08.040 --> 29:10.156
...or you're with her.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.112
Come on, come on,
prance this way.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.474
Here we go, here we go.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.155
Move it, move it, move it, today!

29:19.320 --> 29:21.788
Hey, quit manhandling us.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.918
- We're not your pets.
- No, you're just a pain, now go on.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.389
And don't let the neighbours see you.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.916
Check out the size
of that oracle's... ball.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.237
Phoebe, focus.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.193
Oh!

29:35.640 --> 29:38.108
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.555
Stay away from those windows.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.349
What the hell
is going on around here?

29:46.520 --> 29:49.239
If you haven't noticed,
the world's a mess out there.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.994
Something terrible's going on.
Everyone senses it.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.392
- The Titans?
- Must be.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.870
So you guys just all came here
figuring we would stop them?

29:58.040 --> 30:01.077
Well, you are the Charmed Ones,
aren't you?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.470
Do you always leave
the little one unattended?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.238
- No!
- No!

30:08.400 --> 30:10.868
Well, just sounds like
he needs to be changed.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.871
- I'll take care of it.
- Hold it!

30:13.640 --> 30:16.552
You are not the nanny,
we rejected you.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.676
No, I rejected you.

30:19.480 --> 30:22.950
But I suppose I could fill in,
just for a bit.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.549
Did she just hire herself?

30:27.720 --> 30:28.789
You need to go watch her.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.269
What about the Elders? They need
to know the Titans are back.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.080
Can't Chris tell them?
He's a whitelighter, isn't he?

30:34.240 --> 30:35.593
Wait a minute.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.198
Where is he?

30:39.200 --> 30:41.714
- Upstairs with Paige.
- And the <i>Book.</i>

30:41.880 --> 30:43.393
All right, you, to the elf.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.437
You keep an eye
on our magical houseguests.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.239
Herd them into the basement
or something.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.270
I'm gonna go see
what future-boy is up to.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.714
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

30:59.920 --> 31:02.309
I'm trying to find a way to free
stone-cold Paige over here.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.993
Step away.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.555
Please, like I haven't
looked in this before?

31:07.400 --> 31:10.039
By the way, you should
update your goblins entry.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.839
It'll come in handy someday.

31:14.360 --> 31:18.672
- Goblins?
- Yeah. Trust me, it's gonna get ugly.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.393
Look, obviously you don't trust me.
But I touched the <i>Book,</i> right?

31:22.600 --> 31:24.431
And the <i>Book</i> thinks I'm good,
shouldn't you?

31:24.600 --> 31:27.398
- Maybe you found a way around that.
- Piper, come on.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.079
I'm just trying to help.

31:29.240 --> 31:32.949
Well, then, if that's true, why don't you
tell me how to vanquish the Titans?

31:33.160 --> 31:35.390
Except you can't vanquish them.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.392
You mean not without
the power of three?

31:37.560 --> 31:38.913
Maybe not even with that.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.719
The only way the Elders could stop
them 3000 years ago

31:41.880 --> 31:44.314
was by infusing some mortals
with a hell of a lot of power,

31:44.480 --> 31:45.674
way more than you guys have.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.353
So they can do that again.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.078
Not after what happened last time.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.357
When the mortals trapped the Titans,
the power went to their heads.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.830
They declared themselves gods
and forced the world to worship them.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.231
The Elders swore they would
never allow that to happen again.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.597
Hang on a second,
I'm having a 9th-grade flashback.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.752
You're talking about the Greek gods,
Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite?

32:05.920 --> 32:08.115
- They were mortals?
- Mythology left that part out.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.914
Not the only inaccuracy, by the way.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.518
Phoebe, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be...

32:15.720 --> 32:18.029
I know, I know. But I thought
they could help us free Paige.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.589
After all, a leprechaun's luck
has helped us before.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.228
He's the leprechaun,
I'm one of the seven dwarfs.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.231
Try to keep it straight, will you?

32:25.800 --> 32:27.199
Sorry.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.038
It's gonna take a lot more than
just me luck to free this one.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.231
We're gonna need
some pixie dust too.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.073
I'll get a fairy.
I left my axe downstairs anyway.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.515
Okay, so where are we?

32:42.720 --> 32:45.712
Screwed, possibly.
One thing I'm still not clear about:

32:45.880 --> 32:49.316
If the Titans are roaming around,
why are they killing whitelighters?

32:49.520 --> 32:51.033
Because they need
their orbing power.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.708
Their orbing power? What on
earth would they wanna do with...?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.592
Oh, my God.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.193
Leo!

32:59.280 --> 33:01.430
What did I miss?
What did she just figure out?

33:01.600 --> 33:03.397
Nothing good.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.709
How did you know he was cold?

33:12.920 --> 33:14.592
Babies are what I do.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.313
Leo?

33:17.520 --> 33:19.033
The Titans are after the Elders.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.758
- What?
- You have to go warn them,

33:20.920 --> 33:22.797
but don't stay up there too long.
Hurry.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.878
No!

34:17.360 --> 34:20.079
Now, laddie!

34:22.480 --> 34:24.675
Don't know what else to try.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.558
Running out of gold too, I'm afraid.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.359
Okay, well, there's gotta
be something we can do.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.033
Just keep trying.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.393
- What are you doing over here?
- Nothing.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.630
You guys keep this stuff forever,
you know that?

34:38.840 --> 34:41.195
You knew the Titans were
after the Elders, didn't you?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.237
Why didn't you tell us?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.868
I told you, there's some things
I can't tell you.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.076
Some things you need
to figure out on your own.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.310
Even at the risk
of making things worse?

34:53.199 --> 34:54.838
All right, what's going on?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.629
Leo's not responding to any of my calls
and it's been over five hours.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.598
- I really don't know.
- Well, I really think you do.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.876
Look. You're the one
who wanted him to go up there

35:04.040 --> 35:06.190
in the first place. Not me.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.032
All right, fine. Maybe I do know.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.589
And if I'm right, he's gonna
need some serious alone time.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.513
You know what? Cut it out
with the cryptic crap.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.240
You need to go up there
and bring him back, now.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.594
No more games.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.478
Okay. Fine, I'll go.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.835
But if I were you two,
I'd focus on freeing Paige

35:22.000 --> 35:25.276
because you're
gonna need her, soon.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.790
I swear to God,
if he does not come back with Leo,

35:30.960 --> 35:33.838
I'm gonna blow his ass
back to the future, orbs and all!

35:34.040 --> 35:35.268
You know what?

35:35.440 --> 35:39.035
Why don't you go be with Wyatt, and
I will take care of everything up here.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.231
I will call you
if anything happens, I promise.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.793
- You're not breathing.
- Nope.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.359
Breathe.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.359
Okay, next sister.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.278
Leo?

35:57.240 --> 35:58.639
Why didn't you tell me?

35:58.800 --> 36:00.995
- Why did you let this happen?!
- Easy, easy.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.355
- Why?
- Because this had to happen!

36:03.520 --> 36:05.988
It had to happen so you
could do what has to be done.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.595
What are you talking about?
They're all dead.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.593
- Gone.
- No.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.352
Not all of them.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.112
Some of the Elders
escaped back to Earth,

36:16.280 --> 36:19.636
but it won't be long before
the Titans hunt them down too.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.436
But you can still stop them.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.790
You can still defeat the Titans.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.353
How?

36:28.440 --> 36:30.556
I think you know how.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.071
It's too dangerous.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.351
The Elders forbid it.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.913
True.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.550
But then again, the Elders aren't
around to stop you now, are they?

36:43.240 --> 36:44.673
That's right, Leo.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.637
This is what it's all about.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.634
This is why they had to die, so you
could do something they'd never do.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.195
To save the future for your family.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.954
For your son.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.068
- This is crazy.
- Maybe.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.635
But it's our only chance.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.236
Like it or not, you've been put in
the situation for a reason, Leo.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.311
We both have.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.629
Says you.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.748
How do I know you're not trying
to manipulate this situation

37:12.960 --> 37:14.712
for your own future?

37:14.880 --> 37:17.553
Just the way you've
manipulated everything else.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.233
You don't.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.072
But what choice do you really have?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.308
There's certainly no future
unless you do something.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.473
I don't know.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.433
Even if I were to believe you...

37:30.600 --> 37:32.750
...even if I were willing...

37:33.920 --> 37:35.399
...I couldn't.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.759
I'm no Elder.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.959
Well, you better start acting like one.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.039
Now!

37:54.040 --> 37:55.519
Hit it!

37:59.720 --> 38:02.473
Oh, honey! Hi!

38:02.640 --> 38:05.279
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you. Are you okay?

38:05.440 --> 38:07.874
What happened?
Where's the Titan?

38:08.840 --> 38:10.751
What the hell
are these guys doing here?

38:10.920 --> 38:13.639
Long story, I'll tell you on the way.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.429
You're welcome.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.990
There you are.

38:22.240 --> 38:26.631
Okay, I get the whole epic Titan
thing but what I'm not getting

38:26.800 --> 38:28.119
is the Chris thing.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.838
We're still trying to figure that out.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.195
- Look who's not stoned.
- Welcome back.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.634
You've missed a lot.

38:33.840 --> 38:37.719
Yeah, I can't help but think
it's kind of all my fault.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.395
I mean I'm the one who lured the
Titans here. Insert "I told you so."

38:41.560 --> 38:43.039
Done.

38:43.240 --> 38:48.268
I just kind of was obsessed with
the whole weird dreams thing and...

38:48.760 --> 38:52.230
But I am so sorry for any distress
I might have caused you, Piper.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.953
Don't worry about it.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.156
I should have listened
to you in the first place.

38:56.320 --> 38:59.551
Just trying not to worry, or to panic.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.553
But I've just got this terrible feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.990
What kind of feeling?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.790
That Leo's not coming back.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.552
Sweetie.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.476
Of course he's coming back.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.438
How could he not?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.875
I don't know, it's just
something that Chris said

39:19.040 --> 39:22.077
about Leo having to
go through this alone.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.954
I don't know.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.954
What the hell is he doing up there?

39:32.040 --> 39:34.793
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're all leaving now.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.829
- Wait. Why?
- Didn't you hear the distress call?

39:38.240 --> 39:41.710
The surviving Elders have all been
flushed out. They need our protection.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.949
"Surviving"?

39:43.120 --> 39:47.033
The elf will stay behind to take care
of the kid while you battle the Titans.

39:49.400 --> 39:52.676
Wait, who said anything
about us battling the Titans?

39:52.840 --> 39:54.592
Leo.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.872
Leo!

40:01.160 --> 40:02.309
- Piper.
- No.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.550
- But she needs me.
- Not as much as the rest of us do.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.238
You need to stay here.
Even afterwards, to coordinate.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.318
All right.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.553
Then you should go.
Otherwise the girls won't understand.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.479
Good luck.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.358
<i>Leo!</i>

40:49.800 --> 40:51.518
<i>Leo!</i>

40:51.720 --> 40:54.632
Leo, for God sakes,
if you can hear me...

40:57.160 --> 40:58.832
You? Where's Leo?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.195
He's safe, for now.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.869
- Paige, hi.
- Hi.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.431
Forget that.
What do you mean, for now?

41:06.640 --> 41:08.358
- What's going on?
- What is this about us

41:08.520 --> 41:10.397
supposedly battling the Titans?

41:10.560 --> 41:11.993
You're about to find out.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.750
What's that supposed to mean?

41:31.480 --> 41:33.755
- That's what that means.
- What happened?

41:33.920 --> 41:35.035
What are we?

41:36.320 --> 41:37.673
You're gods.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.393
You expect us to beat
the Titans dressed like this?

41:49.560 --> 41:50.959
Maybe at a costume party.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.238
That's not a costume, that represents
your new position and power.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.356
- Power?
- Power's good.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.431
I like power.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.598
- Why do I like power?
- Because you are the goddess of war.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.513
Oh, well I guess
that explains the pitchfork.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.716
It's not a pitchfork, it's a trident.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.632
Be careful,
that's a formidable weapon.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.677
Right on.
Who wants to fight?

42:11.840 --> 42:13.478
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.319
- You're the goddess of love.
- Naturally.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.789
Well, then, that must make
me the goddess of sanity

42:18.960 --> 42:20.712
because I find this ridiculous.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.992
Actually, Leo gave you dominion over
the earth and all its natural elements.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.515
Wait a minute.
You're saying that Leo did this to us?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.798
Chris, you never told us.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.520
Do you have a girlfriend
in the future?

42:32.720 --> 42:35.996
As you can see, all of you have drives
and urges based on your powers.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.435
Don't let them distract you, all right?

42:38.600 --> 42:39.953
Stay focused.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.439
Focused on the Titans.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.478
Hold it, pal! I don't know what
what kind of game you're running here,

42:44.640 --> 42:46.312
but Leo is not
in the god-making business.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.919
How old are you anyway?

42:48.080 --> 42:51.311
The Elders forbid it. And if anything,
Leo is a company man.

42:51.480 --> 42:54.870
The Elders did forbid it.
And guess what? They're dead.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.314
Most of them.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.596
Leo's in charge up there now,
and he's taking a huge risk

42:58.760 --> 43:02.469
that you won't lose your humanity
like the ancient Greek... Whoa!

43:03.600 --> 43:05.989
You killed the Elders,
you could have prevented it.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.513
I say we castrate him.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.636
A little control here, ladies, please?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.394
Can't we figure out
something else to cut off?

43:14.920 --> 43:17.753
I told you, stay focused!

43:17.920 --> 43:20.354
In my future,
all the Elders were killed.

43:20.520 --> 43:23.080
That's why I came back,
to help Leo give you the power

43:23.240 --> 43:25.151
so this would never
have to happen again.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.992
Hey, guys, watch this.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.514
Put that thing down!
You're gonna hurt someone.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.709
I certainly hope so.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.791
Do you know the kind of
damage this thing could do?

43:36.960 --> 43:38.518
- A lot.
- Paige.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.756
Make love, not, you know...

43:41.040 --> 43:43.110
There's no door love can't open.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.197
No wall love can't climb.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.318
No hurdle love can't... hurdle.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.277
This is Leo's strategy?

43:50.440 --> 43:51.793
Well, he must have lost it up there,

43:51.960 --> 43:54.110
because these girls can't
be seen in public, much less...

43:54.280 --> 43:57.192
Oh, that reminds me.
I'm late for the bachelor auction.

43:57.360 --> 44:00.432
I'm gonna go pick up
a guy or two, or 12.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.318
Phoebe!

44:02.560 --> 44:03.595
Oh, that's a good idea.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.718
I'm gonna go get in some
target practice on some demons.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.836
Watch out, Titans.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.914
I knew this was gonna happen.
You gotta go after them.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.719
Oh, no, no, no, this was your
big plan, you clean up the mess.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.314
No, your role is to provide balance.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.596
That's why you feel
so grounded and in control.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.320
Wow, Chris, that was
actually pretty good.

44:24.480 --> 44:27.153
You almost sounded like a whitelighter.
Too bad I already have one.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.878
And if he would like me
to do something,

44:29.040 --> 44:30.792
he can come down
and tell me himself.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.313
Do you hear that?

44:33.040 --> 44:34.712
You want Leo?

44:35.600 --> 44:36.999
Then vanquish the Titans.

44:37.160 --> 44:40.994
If you can't do that, you're gonna find
out what a world of darkness feels like.

44:41.600 --> 44:42.749
My world.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.988
I can sense what's left of the Elders.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.395
They're scared
and running for their lives.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.712
You're still angry with me
for killing her, aren't you?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.119
Demetrius, I'm sorry.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.311
Meta was a distraction.

45:05.480 --> 45:09.109
Once we control the heavens,
you can have any woman you want.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.595
I want you to know
I did what had to be done.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.671
We needed to hit
the Elders hard and fast.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.432
And we did. Right?

45:17.360 --> 45:18.554
Demetrius...

45:19.960 --> 45:22.713
...let's go finish off the Elders.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.712
Ladies, prepare your checkbooks,
because here comes Evan.

45:37.480 --> 45:41.234
Oh, my, my, somebody
turn the heat down in here.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.550
I don't have to take off
my clothes or anything, do I?

45:46.560 --> 45:48.516
That's entirely up to you.

45:48.720 --> 45:52.076
Okay, ladies, Evan's
an internist from Sausalito.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.110
And he promises the highest
bidder a free physical on their date.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.829
So who'll start the bidding?

46:00.520 --> 46:03.671
- Four hundred!
- Excellent, do I hear 500?

46:03.840 --> 46:06.308
One thousand dollars.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.829
Phoebe!

46:20.720 --> 46:23.917
Can I bid on her?

46:24.120 --> 46:26.839
- If you insist.
- That isn't, this isn't, I don't really...

46:27.000 --> 46:30.197
I got a $10,000
limit on my credit card.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.476
- Well, okay then.
- Eleven thousand!

46:32.640 --> 46:34.232
- Twelve thousand.
- Thirteen thousand.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.152
- Fourteen thousand.
- Fourteen-five!

46:36.320 --> 46:38.197
- Fifteen thousand.
- Sixteen thousand.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.510
- Eighteen thousand!
- Easy, boys.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.717
There's plenty to go around.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.548
Come on, now,
hit me with your best shot.

46:57.120 --> 47:02.513
Give me one firm spot on which
to stand, and I will move the Earth.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.357
Archimedes said that.

47:10.520 --> 47:13.318
Great warrior,
and he didn't even have a trident.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.476
Okay, on your knees.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.312
Kiss the hand of the Paige!

47:17.480 --> 47:19.630
Paige, my liege.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.511
Being a goddess
does have its perks.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.950
Paige, what are you doing?

47:29.120 --> 47:30.109
How did you find me?

47:30.400 --> 47:33.073
Apparently it's one of my powers,
to keep an eye on you.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.514
What is going on here?

47:34.720 --> 47:36.836
Oh, I'm just building an army.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.956
I figured, what better way
to smite the Titans

47:39.120 --> 47:40.553
than with hordes of demons, right?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.039
Wrong.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.315
All of you, out!

47:43.480 --> 47:45.596
We answer only to our liege.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.549
- I see.
- See, they're very loyal.

47:49.720 --> 47:54.077
And you know what? I don't know why
I was wasting time studying witchcraft

47:54.240 --> 47:57.198
when I clearly should have been
earning my general's stripes.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.154
I said go, now!

48:07.600 --> 48:10.034
What did you have to do that for?
I had followers.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.675
You can't have followers.
None of us can.

48:12.840 --> 48:16.116
Now come on, before
I unleash my wrath on you.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.036
Not in the house.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.876
Now let's go find Phoebe.

48:27.720 --> 48:31.030
My word, this is a house of ill-repute.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.758
Hardly suitable for an infant.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.672
What do you mean?

48:36.840 --> 48:38.432
How does that feel, Phoebe?

48:41.880 --> 48:44.633
Oh, make sure you
peel those for me, will you?

48:44.800 --> 48:46.074
Yes, of course.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.879
Phoebe, we need to talk.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.473
Yes, we do.

48:50.640 --> 48:53.518
The world would be overflowing
with peace and love

48:53.720 --> 48:55.278
if only we just talked more.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.714
What are they doing here?

48:57.880 --> 49:02.317
Oh, worshipping me,
adoring me, exalting my name.

49:02.520 --> 49:06.035
There is so much love in this room,
I can barely stand it.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.669
Me neither.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.717
It's time to send your
groupies away, now.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.269
But serving me
makes them so happy.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.874
Thank you, bachelor number three.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.679
All right, all of you,
show is over, move along.

49:21.840 --> 49:23.273
We live to serve Phoebe.

49:23.440 --> 49:26.352
Oh you do, don't you?
That's so sweet.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.318
Piper, you need to get
some followers of your own.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.317
It's a really great confidence-builder.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.999
Are you eyeing me, soldier?

49:33.320 --> 49:36.312
What the hell is this?
Goddesses gone wild?

49:36.800 --> 49:39.917
I told you to keep them in line.
What if the Titans attacked now?

49:40.120 --> 49:43.237
Chris, I've got it, thank you.
All of you!

49:43.400 --> 49:45.311
Out!

49:57.920 --> 49:59.592
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

49:59.840 --> 50:01.478
Time for a morality check.

50:01.640 --> 50:06.191
Leo did not give us this power so
we could form armies or love cults.

50:06.400 --> 50:09.119
The ancient Greeks
indulged in their whims that way,

50:09.280 --> 50:10.429
and look what they became.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.313
Petty, evil, vindictive...

50:13.480 --> 50:16.153
Thanks, I've got it. Now.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.914
Hi. Can you two get it under control?

50:19.080 --> 50:22.152
"Reason and judgment
are the qualities of a leader."

50:22.320 --> 50:24.959
Tacitus, 100 A.D.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.510
"Love will keep us together."

50:28.680 --> 50:31.240
Captain and Tennille, 1970s.

50:32.600 --> 50:36.070
Fascinating. Now can we figure
out a way to beat the Titans?

50:36.240 --> 50:39.391
Because I for one would
like my family back soon.

50:39.560 --> 50:40.595
Is that a jingle?

50:40.800 --> 50:43.109
There are no Elders up there.
Who's jingling?

50:44.680 --> 50:46.750
- It's Leo.
- Leo can jingle?

50:46.920 --> 50:50.037
Yep. He says
an Elder's under attack.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.919
Like it or not,
it's time to face the Titans.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.277
Stand back, wise one.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.391
Such bravery in the face of death.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.238
We ain't the ones
that will be dying today.

51:10.760 --> 51:13.354
Remind me when we're through
with the Elders to do something...

51:13.520 --> 51:15.351
...nice for the leprechaun community.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.988
We've beaten you before, Cronus.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.792
- We'll do it again.
- How?

51:20.960 --> 51:25.033
Your numbers are dwindling. By day's
end, the great Elders will all be dead.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.589
And we'll own the heavens.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.152
Who are you?

51:34.760 --> 51:36.318
The Supremes.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.194
- She wields the powers of the gods!
- Just kill the Elder.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.479
Somebody get the Elder out.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.632
- I can't. I can't move.
- Me neither.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.552
Leo!

51:58.120 --> 52:00.076
Where did they go?

52:19.200 --> 52:22.192
- Everybody okay?
- No. Is my hair singed?

52:22.400 --> 52:23.515
You're fine.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.678
I guess we're not so
all-powerful after all.

52:26.840 --> 52:29.798
- How did we get out of there?
- I guess Leo must have orbed us out.

52:29.960 --> 52:32.633
But I don't know how.
He doesn't have that kind of power.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.876
Well, he must have
because we're out of there.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.508
What is this place, a sewer?

52:39.120 --> 52:41.953
This is... sanctuary.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.275
Oh, my, my, my.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.119
Aren't you just the edible Elder.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.959
Have you taken a vow of celibacy?

52:51.840 --> 52:54.957
- Phoebe, stay on target.
- Right.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.917
What do you mean, this is sanctuary?

52:57.080 --> 52:58.115
It's a safe house...

52:58.320 --> 52:59.992
...set up by Leo to protect the Elders.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.872
Well, it doesn't look so safe to me.

53:02.040 --> 53:04.156
I can see unprotected
points of entry all over the place.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.118
Don't worry.
The Titans can't sense our location.

53:07.320 --> 53:09.629
We're hidden from them
by a web of fairy magic.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.756
Another of Leo's ideas.

53:12.920 --> 53:15.832
- Leo did all this?
- I was surprised myself.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.833
I'm afraid I'm one of the Elders
who always sold Leo short.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.117
What with him
marrying a witch and all.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.350
- No offence.
- Offence taken.

53:24.520 --> 53:26.875
I will never make that mistake again.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.519
Without Leo, we'd all be dead.

53:29.040 --> 53:33.113
He's out there now tracking Elders
as we speak, moving them here.

53:33.320 --> 53:36.232
- We owe Leo everything.
- I guess so.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.756
Well, good luck with the Titans.

53:39.920 --> 53:40.989
One more question:

53:42.480 --> 53:44.357
What are you wearing
under that robe?

53:45.560 --> 53:47.516
More robes.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.756
Oh, that is so hot.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.519
This is getting tired.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.477
A warrior preparing for battle
cannot be weary.

53:55.640 --> 53:58.393
No, I'm tired of getting all
this information second-hand.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.788
I would like to hear it from Leo.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.959
Piper, I'm sensing a blockage
in your spiritual energy.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.157
- What's wrong, sweetie?
- I need to talk to my husband.

54:07.320 --> 54:11.677
I appreciate him becoming a magical
folk hero for the masses and all,

54:11.840 --> 54:14.195
I really do.
But enough is enough.

54:14.360 --> 54:15.588
Leo!

54:15.760 --> 54:18.399
Remember me, your wife?

54:19.120 --> 54:22.237
Don't you jingle me!
I need more than a jingle here, mister!

54:22.400 --> 54:25.392
You will get down here right now!

54:36.200 --> 54:38.395
Are you trying to alert the enemy?

54:38.600 --> 54:42.673
Piper, I'm sure as soon as Leo
figures out how angry you are

54:42.840 --> 54:45.400
he's gonna come
running down here.

54:49.840 --> 54:52.991
Okay, you can come running now.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.555
Look, sweetie,
it's not like he's not busy.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.199
He's saving the world.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.271
And buying us time
to vanquish the Titans,

55:00.480 --> 55:02.914
although I don't know where
we're gonna get the strength from.

55:03.080 --> 55:06.072
- They had no problem with my power.
- Then let's try my power.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.995
I've been waiting for you...

55:17.480 --> 55:20.119
...my whole life.
- You have?

55:21.360 --> 55:22.509
Why?

55:22.680 --> 55:24.671
Why?

55:25.520 --> 55:26.873
It doesn't matter.

55:27.040 --> 55:32.478
The only thing that matters
is that you're here, and I'm here.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.270
- Do you know what that means?
- We're here?

55:35.480 --> 55:36.993
Right.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.991
Together.

55:39.160 --> 55:42.277
- Do you want me?
- Very much.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.596
I'm all yours.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.513
But wait, what would Cronus think?

55:47.680 --> 55:49.989
I don't care what Cronus thinks.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.993
If he tries to stop me, I'll just...

55:53.160 --> 55:55.435
What are you doing, Demetrius?

55:55.600 --> 55:57.989
The goddess wants to seduce me.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.991
I was just playing along
till you got here.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.830
Phooey!

56:06.080 --> 56:08.594
End war game.

56:08.760 --> 56:12.548
- My way didn't work.
- Nothing's working. I need a break.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.995
How did the Greeks do it?

56:15.160 --> 56:17.913
Well, for one thing,
there were more of them.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.877
Like an entire
mountaintop full of them,

56:20.080 --> 56:21.479
until their powers consumed them.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.398
Maybe declaring themselves gods

56:23.560 --> 56:25.915
gave them strength
to defeat the Titans.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.070
- I'd rather be flayed alive.
- Not an option for me.

56:31.600 --> 56:33.079
God...

56:33.760 --> 56:35.079
I miss Leo.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.753
Leo?

56:38.400 --> 56:41.676
- Oh, it's just you.
- Hello to you too.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.875
So the Elders are taken care of.

56:45.680 --> 56:48.478
- Where's Piper?
- She's upstairs with the baby.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.514
- Could you bring us Leo?
- He's busy.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.511
- How's it going here?
- Not so good.

56:54.680 --> 56:57.148
I keep trying to come up
with a plan to defeat the Titans,

56:57.320 --> 56:58.833
but every simulation
ends the same way.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.956
With our death.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.031
We could really use
Leo right about now.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.553
I'm starting to get
that impression.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.911
- Could you bring him back?
- For the last time, no.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.752
What is wrong with you two, huh?

57:09.920 --> 57:11.990
- You're acting hopeless.
- I don't know.

57:12.200 --> 57:15.078
I guess I always feel like this
right before a big battle.

57:15.440 --> 57:20.070
And then Leo comes down,
and I don't know how he does it...

57:20.240 --> 57:23.152
...but he makes me feel like
I have the power to do anything.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.317
Really?
It's different for me.

57:25.480 --> 57:28.358
It's like I forget that I even
have any training and I,

57:28.520 --> 57:32.559
and I can't concentrate. But Leo
helps me focus and calm down.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.115
You know, I'm starting to think
that we take Leo for granted.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.679
Are you sure
that you can't get him?

57:36.840 --> 57:38.751
Leo is up there, okay?

57:38.920 --> 57:41.388
And he's gotta stay up there until...
You know what?

57:41.600 --> 57:43.556
I'm not gonna go over this again.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.029
What can I do to get you two
over the hump here?

57:46.240 --> 57:48.595
Try saying this,
it always works for Leo:

57:48.760 --> 57:51.797
"Your power comes
from your emotions."

57:52.000 --> 57:55.151
Or what about this?
"Trust the power of three."

57:55.320 --> 57:56.469
Or how about this one?

57:56.640 --> 57:58.119
"I'm gonna go
check with the Elders."

57:58.280 --> 58:00.555
Do you actually think
he checks with the Elders?

58:00.760 --> 58:03.228
No. He probably
just orbs to a sports bar

58:03.440 --> 58:07.069
and buys his buddies rounds of drinks.
"My wife thinks I'm up there.

58:07.240 --> 58:09.231
Here's to the Elders."

58:10.440 --> 58:12.078
You really are helpless without him.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.114
Somebody's still alive up here.

58:20.440 --> 58:22.317
We don't know that, Cronus.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.198
Maybe the world's magic
has increased

58:24.360 --> 58:25.952
since we were frozen in that...

58:26.120 --> 58:27.155
Demetrius!

58:27.320 --> 58:29.754
The trident, she had the trident.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.876
The Greek gods have been
re-created, which means

58:32.040 --> 58:34.474
somebody up here released
their essence as mortals.

58:34.640 --> 58:38.235
Which means
somebody is still up here.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.318
If you're right, and the
gods have been re-created,

58:41.480 --> 58:44.552
then we should be after them now
before their powers grow too strong.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.119
No.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.510
Whoever's up here
will just create new gods.

58:48.680 --> 58:51.353
That threat must be dealt with now.

58:53.720 --> 58:57.110
- I am sensing something.
- Where?

58:57.280 --> 58:58.918
It's faint.

59:02.440 --> 59:03.953
There.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.199
Whoever created these gods,
whoever is hiding, they're trapped.

59:10.360 --> 59:13.750
They can't dematerialize
without exposing themselves to us.

59:13.920 --> 59:17.151
There's only so many
places up here they can hide.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.638
I could have sworn...

59:23.840 --> 59:25.114
I don't see anything.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.310
Keep looking.

59:37.920 --> 59:41.435
I know you miss him.
I miss him too.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.394
I need help.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.592
Excuse me.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.638
This is my bedroom, you can't
just walk in here anytime you want to.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.115
Yeah, I know.
But your sisters need you.

59:53.360 --> 59:56.796
I got them working on the Titans but I
don't know how long that's gonna last.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.351
- I thought you needed me.
- I did. I mean, I do.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.949
I need you because they need you.
Actually, they need Leo.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.156
Look, will you please
just go deal with them?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.392
What's the matter? Chris, the
all-knowing, running out of answers?

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.993
Yes, yes I am.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.310
If that will motivate you,
yes, I'm losing control.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.677
I'm watching history repeat itself and
nobody's doing a damn thing about it!

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.592
I feel your frustration.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.675
Piper, if it helps, I get it. Okay? I do.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.796
Really. You need Leo.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.513
Your sisters need Leo.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.910
- But if you can't stop...
- You forgot the baby.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.308
The baby needs his father too.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.311
Fine. But if you can't stop
missing your husband

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.152
long enough to see
the bigger picture...

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.992
There is no bigger picture
than my family.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.355
Well, then, pay attention,
because the world I grew up in,

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.432
families hardly existed.
I never had a chance to know mine.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.511
- Not my fault.
- Not yet.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.595
Is that what this is about?

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.472
You blame us
for what happened to you?

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.796
I just want you
to get it right this time.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.752
Use your power of three.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.592
Use your power as gods.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.591
Save the world from going to hell.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.950
If that's what you want,
then I will say it one more time,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.439
and maybe you will hear me.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.397
We need Leo.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.996
Now, excuse me,
I have to go warm up a bottle.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.470
Don't worry.
You'll come to trust me in time.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.992
They all will.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.911
What are you doing?
You're gonna expose us!

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.308
That's the idea.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.471
Did you sense that?

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.517
Someone orbed.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.070
Hurry, go. Piper needs you.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.273
Leo, how could you leave us?

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.310
Who are you?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.759
Hi, Piper.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.036
You're home.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.799
You heard my calls, right?

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.109
Of course I did, honey.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.912
But I had to make sure
the Elders were safe,

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.712
and then I was cornered
by the Titans.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.912
I'm just thankful you're okay.
My mind was just racing.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.917
I know, I felt it.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.317
- Good thing Chris came when he did.
- Chris?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.590
He distracted the Titans
so I could escape.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.719
Right now they're probably following
his orb trail, so we don't have...

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.108
What's wrong with your hair?

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.679
What?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.758
It's white.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.992
Is it?

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.596
Wow, must be from
staying up there for so long.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.193
I guess so.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.554
Where are your sisters?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.435
Well, they can wait a minute
while we spend some time alone.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.192
And then you need to hold your son.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.715
Spoken like a true earth goddess.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.709
What are you talking about?

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.912
You need to channel your hearth
and home instincts to fight the Titans.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.833
Leo, I was speaking
from the heart, not the hearth.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.036
Hi, I'm your wife. Remember?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.516
I do. But Chris can only
throw off the Titans for so long.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.358
We need to be ready
with a battle plan.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.397
Now let's find your sisters.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.114
Ma'am, I was just coming
to check on the baby.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.108
That's okay, because
he's actually sleeping so...

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.393
Welcome, wise one.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.715
Oh, no, this is just my husband.
He's not an Elder.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.115
He's just wearing
this robe because...

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.952
Why are you wearing this robe?

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.951
It was windy up there.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.111
See? So you can take a break
because, you know,

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.753
Wyatt's asleep and...

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.111
Okay, here we go.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.597
It says in there that Cronus
swallowed his newborn children

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.558
to keep them from overthrowing him.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.634
What if you lure the Titans to a field,
Piper lifts them with a tornado,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.360
and I hit them with my lightning?

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.432
I'm afraid there's no way to beat a man
who eats his own children.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.511
- Those stories are fables.
- Leo!

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.671
Welcome home, Leo.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.669
What do you have for me?

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.673
Paige ran every battle plan she knows,
which as a war goddess

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.310
is basically every battle
that's ever been fought.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.789
No matter how you spin it,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.151
warrior, seductress, earth mother,

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.311
we don't have the power
to defeat the Titans.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.278
We can't beat them.
They're too strong for us.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.273
See how much
this family needs you?

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.799
No.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.632
I don't.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.075
You can do this without me.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.955
And it's not because you have the
power of gods or the power of three.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.069
It's because

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.717
you're the greatest force of good that
I know, and that's why I chose you.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.870
Oh, see? I can just feel
the confidence wash all over me.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.270
- He's doing it.
- What is he doing?

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.598
Paige, you know exactly where to
find the power to conquer the Titans.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.799
- I do?
- Yes, you just need to focus.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.912
- We have to declare ourselves gods.
- That's how the ancient Greeks did it.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.118
Chris told us not to do that.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.474
Well, Chris is wrong.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.755
He doesn't know you like I do.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.673
But, Leo, the ancient Greeks
lost their humanity.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.235
You're not the ancient Greeks.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.759
You're the Charmed Ones.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.315
I didn't give you
anything you can't handle.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.195
Phoebe, you lost yourself to
the darkest love that ever existed,

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.634
and you came back.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.432
Of course you can handle
being the goddess of love.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.079
I never thought of it that way.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.755
Paige, you're the goddess of war
because you've been consumed

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.912
with gaining power, but you've never
let the power consume you.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.475
Piper...

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.749
...is it any wonder I made you
the goddess of earth?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.351
You are everything that is
good and beautiful in this world.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.552
The mother of my son.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.877
You really have
that much faith in us?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.758
Do you really even need to ask that?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.719
It's like I've always said,
your power comes from your emotion.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.759
And right now you need to
dig deeper than you ever have before.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.639
Whatever motivates you,
your heart, your soul,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.792
your darkest fears, whatever it takes.
You need to find that

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.076
and channel it into power.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.515
Power, not to capture the Titans,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.836
but to destroy them.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.792
Forever.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:51.989
Leo?

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.910
What's happening to me?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.153
He's not here.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.311
Another dead end.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.714
No.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.519
The orb trail's getting stronger.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.830
We're getting closer.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.111
We'll push ahead.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.476
Wait, wait.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.757
Do you sense that?

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.395
An Elder out in the open.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.590
Do you think it's our target?

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.588
There's only one way to find out.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.318
I'll never leave you.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.590
I promise.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.151
Why would you?

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.913
- Leo, what's going on?
- I'm not sure.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.951
What do you mean you're not sure?

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.479
Chris, wherever you are,
get your ass over here!

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.591
It's okay, Chris.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.108
This better be an emergency.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.118
You are gonna lead the Titans
straight to us.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.548
What's happening to my husband?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.949
Something amazing.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.519
You know what? Cut the crap!

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.473
You knew the Elders were gonna die.
You coached Leo up there.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.517
You knew all of this
was gonna happen.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.148
- Did you?
- You're not serious.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.671
Whatever it is you think you're doing,
you need to make it stop.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.399
Piper, nobody chose this.
It chose Leo.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.551
What he did up there, for all of us,
was nothing short of a miracle.

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:28.316
Now he's receiving
the ultimate reward.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.238
- A chance to become an...
- Don't you dare say it!

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.710
The world needs sources of good
to watch over it.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.792
Do you know a source
of pure goodness better than Leo?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.470
Leo is not...

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.272
He's not an Elder, okay?

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:47.358
Because Elders don't live on Earth.
They don't have families, okay?

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.670
Just tell him you're not an Elder.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.794
I don't know that I can.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.071
I think you should
get back to your sisters.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.435
No. Not until you tell him.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.589
They're waiting for you.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.876
Chris is right. You need to get back
to Paige and Phoebe.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.671
No. Not until you say it.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.756
The Titans are
gonna be here any moment.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.075
I said no!

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.598
He'll be okay.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.837
You did it, Piper.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.229
You found your power.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.874
Now control it.
Don't let it control you.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.517
Piper!

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.950
Where is the Elder
who created you?

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.270
It's not nice
to piss off Mother Nature.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.478
- So much for the Titans.
- Thank God.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.308
You're welcome.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.152
You did it, Piper.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.075
You found the power you needed.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.269
You all did.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.399
Now it's time to give it back.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:01.875
Are you ready?

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.469
Just get it out of me.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.272
How do you feel?

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.398
Free.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.514
Anything on Piper?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.478
- Nope, I still can't get a read.
- Just keep trying.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.072
Okay, even if we do find her,
how are we gonna get her back?

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.800
She's on this major power trip.
She destroyed the Titans.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.632
Not even the Greek gods
could do that.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.673
We just gotta hope she has
some humanity still left inside.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.914
If anyone can come back
from this, it's Piper.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.874
I've gotta go now.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.594
If you need me,
Chris knows how to get in touch.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.795
Where are you going?

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.119
The Elders have returned
to the heavens, and they're calling me.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.673
Did he just bail on us?
Is that what he did?

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.996
What about, you know,
helping us find his wife?

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.434
He's trusting in you to do that.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.158
You need to find Piper
and talk her down

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.630
before she sets up shop somewhere
and throws the world into chaos.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.949
Then it'll be too late for her.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.396
Okay, maybe you missed the part
about Piper being Leo's wife.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.518
Look, you have to understand.
Things have changed.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.070
The Elders need Leo up there
to help restore order.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.269
Cut to the chase, future man.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.789
Is this about Leo being
turned into an Elder, or what?

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.829
He's on the path.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.436
Okay, don't give us
that creepy pod-people smile.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.670
Okay, in your world
being an Elder may be cool,

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.916
but in our world,
it pretty much sucks.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.713
Leo is our brother-in-law.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.472
- And our whitelighter.
- And our friend.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.914
And we don't want to lose him.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.275
So listen,
you go up there and tell Leo...

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.274
What is going on with this storm?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.109
Piper.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.669
- Piper's what's up with the storm.
- What do you mean?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.478
Remember when the Titans
were first released?

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.352
The major weather shifts
and the earthquake?

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.516
- Yeah.
- When you have power over the earth

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.274
like the Titans did, it's bound
to suffer your emotional baggage.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.829
And, like Leo says, our power
comes from our emotions.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.829
Okay.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.276
Okay, so if you're a god,
and you're angry,

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.553
and you're taking it out on the city,
where would you go?

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.079
Somewhere high where I could
enjoy the damage I'm inflicting.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.952
Piper!

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.473
Stay away from me.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.791
- We're taking you home.
- To your family.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.676
What family?

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.235
To your son, Wyatt!

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.074
- Remember him?
- He needs his mother.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.756
He already lost his father, don't take
his mother away from him too.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.588
Where is he?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.994
Where is Leo?

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.111
Piper, what are you doing here?

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.748
How can you do this?

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.036
Excuse us for a minute.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.636
You asked me to marry you,
and I did.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.031
You wanted a family,
and I gave you a son.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.079
And now you want me
to watch you just walk away?

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.275
It's not that simple.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.714
Then make it simple.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.474
Because I'm trying
really hard to understand.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.032
Piper, if I had a choice
in any of this, I would choose you.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.315
I always have.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.390
Then choose me now...

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.676
...and let's go home.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.838
Don't you think I want to?

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.589
I don't know.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.473
And that's what scares me the most.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.276
The Elders were wrong about us.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.796
They didn't think
our love could survive, but it did.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.072
Our love blessed us
in ways they couldn't even imagine.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.989
It gave you the strength
that you needed to take over for Prue.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.870
It produced a baby
with a greater future than any of us.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.798
And it made me...

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.191
An Elder.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.317
Our love is transcendent, Piper.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.316
It lifted me up so high
that this was the only possible result.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.472
Being an Elder wasn't my destiny.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.269
But yet, here I am because of you.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.837
I can't just give up.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.349
I don't know how.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.155
You can't fight this.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.671
Not this.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.875
How am I supposed to do this alone?

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.678
You have your sisters.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.954
It's not the same.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.471
Will I ever see you again?

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.511
I don't know.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.990
I'll always be watching over you.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.994
But you won't be there for Wyatt.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.599
You're gonna miss so much.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.231
I will never leave Wyatt's side.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.232
He will always feel my presence.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.317
It's not the same as human love.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.911
He needs you for that.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.876
He's got me.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.438
And I hope that that's enough.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.673
But what if it's not?

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.074
As an Elder, I have the power
to take your pain away.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.275
You can't make me forget you.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.033
No...

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.076
...help you find peace.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.479
I know, Elise.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.916
Yeah, it really was a great costume.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.992
I'm just glad that the night
was a success.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.071
Okay. You too.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.719
Bye.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.234
Well, I managed to raise $18,000 for
the Bay Mirror Children's Foundation.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.668
Gotta admit,
being a goddess did have its perks.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.673
I even got a second date with Evan.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.157
What's Jason gonna think?

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.038
You know, I miss Jason. I really do.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.236
But I can't put my life
on hold for him.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.436
You know, if he comes back
to San Francisco,

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.192
then we'll give it another shot.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.995
How about you?
You miss being a warrior princess?

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:19.434
No, I do not miss
being a warrior princess.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.956
In fact, I don't even think
I'm gonna miss being super-witch.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.469
What do you mean?

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.470
I've been on this crazy
magic journey for so long now, I...

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.796
I just think it's time to
slow down a bit, you know.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.475
I've kind of let my career slide,
let my friends slide.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.955
I think I'm just tired
and I need a break.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.118
You got it?

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.554
You know, Paige, you should
be really proud of yourself.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.472
All that hard work paid off.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.835
We beat the Titans.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.070
Yeah, I am. That's great.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.317
I guess I'm just kind of looking
forward to a change, you know?

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.233
To help me take my mind off
what we're losing.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.753
Oh, sweetie,
you can't look at it that way.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.638
We didn't lose him.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.199
He'll be watching over us.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.272
It's different.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.797
Come in!

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.275
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.754
Hi.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.271
Are you sure
you want us over today?

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.194
Yeah, I mean,
we don't wanna intrude.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.279
No, you're not intruding.
This was Piper's idea.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:27.029
I can only imagine what
she's going through. How's she doing?

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.269
We're not really sure.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.034
She wanted to be alone
with the baby last night.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.995
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if she
didn't come out of her room for a year.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.309
Hi, guys.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.198
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Hi.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.839
Hi.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.832
We wanted to show our support.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.638
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.153
Leo was...

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.912
...is...

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.798
...somebody who...

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.829
Oh, come on, guys.
This is a celebration.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.752
Leo got promoted.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.273
We should all be happy for him.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.953
- I am.
- You are?

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.479
Of course I am.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.196
Piper, you don't have to put on
a brave face. We're all here for you.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.591
Suppressing emotions
in this family can be dangerous.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.792
No, I'm not suppressing
anything, really. I'm okay.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.709
Now, let's eat before
the baby wakes up from his nap.

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.270
Oh, I forgot the baby monitor.
Here. Be right back.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.839
Okay. Let's eat.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.036
- Go on.
- Yeah, come on, honey.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.231
Something's wrong with Piper.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.197
Maybe she's moved on.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.952
But Piper doesn't move on,
she fights.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.639
I'm telling you, that wasn't Piper.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.108
So did the Elders decide
what to do with me yet?

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.872
Well, you've been the subject
of heated discussion.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.315
One thing we agreed upon is...

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.072
...you can't return to the future.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.674
I figured as much.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.195
The time line's changed.
I don't even know what I'd go back to.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.993
So...

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.118
...what did they decide?

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.030
The Elders voted...

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.671
...to make you the Charmed Ones'
new whitelighter.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.829
They did?

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.032
As a reward for helping
defeat the Titans. But then...

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.711
...somehow, I figured you knew that.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.075
You know, I can't stop thinking
about what Piper said,

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.310
and wondering myself,

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.436
if this wasn't part
of your plan all along.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.195
Take good care of them, Chris.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.159
Don't forget...

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.719
...l'll be watching over you.
