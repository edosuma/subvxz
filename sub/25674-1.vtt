Where is everybody?

14:13.310 --> 14:16.272
I mean, don't you think it's weird
we're the only people in here?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.358
Everybody probably got shipped out
to other prisons.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.527
Ain't none of us
ever going back to Minimum.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.530
Do you think that Alex got shipped out?

14:24.613 --> 14:27.283
Jesus! [groans]

14:28.909 --> 14:31.203
You're like a broken record.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.999
I don't know
where your freakin' girlfriend is.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.876
Is that all you could think about?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.003
Yeah, it's top of my mind these days.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.589
Start thinkin' how you're gonna
save your ass.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.840
From what?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.217
They only brought a few of us in here.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.845
We're the focus group.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.057
They're gonna focus on
blaming our asses for the riots.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.436
-[scuffling]
-[indistinct muttering]

14:55.519 --> 14:57.062
[Herrmann] Stop fucking crying, Natoli. [Natoli] Okay. Okay.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.482
And pick up your side.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.068
Let's get him down,
then we'll have a discussion.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.158
[all grunting]

15:12.494 --> 15:17.541
No. Turn it around. It's gotta look
like he was facing off with them.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.343
-Who is that?
-I don't know.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.306
[shushing]

15:32.389 --> 15:35.559
[Herrmann] We got down here, right?
And he was... He was what?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.519
Being held captive.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.438
By that bunch? Come on.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.816
We met him in the hallway.
He came with us to storm.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.985
They were armed for battle.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.236
Where's that belt?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.197
Here. Here it is.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.575
Holy fuck, there's a gun.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.663
Praise Jesus, someone's on our side.
Give me.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.469
-[gunshots echo]
-Oh! [grunts]

16:12.763 --> 16:14.932
[shushes]

16:15.015 --> 16:16.892
[Natoli] His face
is full of pepper bullets.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.228
Not "bullet" bullets.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.907
[Herrmann] Remind me for the investigation
to request Styvver as our coroner.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.119
Really important that we get Andy Styvver.
Got that?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.078
Gotcha.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.206
All we need is a story
everyone can get behind,

16:39.289 --> 16:42.126
and we're coming out of this
looking like heroes of the day.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.921
So, one of the ladies, the old lady,

16:46.005 --> 16:49.258
maybe one of the black ones,
she's shooting wild.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.302
She's not leaving here
without blood on her hands.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.889
And, so, this guy...
this guy wants to play hero

16:55.973 --> 16:58.600
'cause sooner or later,
she's gonna hit one of us.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.644
So, he goes in to tackle her.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.188
They're struggling over the gun.
And the gun goes off!

17:03.313 --> 17:08.193
Hits him right in the face. Down he goes.
At the same time, it's dark, it's chaos.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.195
We know someone's shooting...

17:11.238 --> 17:14.908
and Natoli, in an earnest attempt
to disarm the shooter,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.995
tries to let off a round of pepper
into the ceiling.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.663
But as he pulls the trigger,

17:19.747 --> 17:22.666
another one of the crazy bitches
hits the barrel of the gun down,

17:22.750 --> 17:25.169
trying to stop him. But it's too late.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.798
The bullets go into the big guy,
who's already met his maker.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.258
Horrible.

17:32.176 --> 17:36.513
And whose fault is that?
The crazy, rioting, murdering cunts.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.973
Fuck you.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.309
[Herrmann] They killed one of ours
in cold blood.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.812
Let's get the fuck outta here.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.398
Hopefully, Bladt and Rein
have found our last two.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.028
[indistinct radio chatter]

17:53.906 --> 17:58.202
[shushes and whispers indistinctly]

17:58.285 --> 18:00.120
Come on. We gotta go.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.585
I don't remember that happening.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.255
What the man said? I don't remember that.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.883
Well, that's 'cause it ain't true.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.886
Don't know what went on,
but they tryin' to pin this shit on us.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.305
I don't like it. I don't like--

18:19.348 --> 18:22.226
Okay, Suzanne. Suzanne.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.144
-[muffled grunting]
-[shushing]

18:24.228 --> 18:27.064
You gotta shut the fuck up, you hear me?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.191
[Suzanne whimpers]

18:29.274 --> 18:30.859
You wanna end up like him?

18:31.777 --> 18:34.988
Then you gotta pull your shit together.
All right?

18:37.574 --> 18:39.243
All right.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.620
-[breathes shakily]
-[officer in distance] Clear.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.705
They're looking for us.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.084
And we gotta let them find us. All right?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.294
Far away from here.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.760
We were never here. You hear me?
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.389
-You wanna see home again?
-[officer in distance] Clear.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.977
We were not here,

19:06.103 --> 19:07.896
and we didn't see shit.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.943
I don't know what to say!

19:13.026 --> 19:17.364
I don't know what to say! There's
the story, then there's the other story,

19:17.447 --> 19:20.325
then there's the up-until story,
then there's the after story,

19:20.409 --> 19:22.244
there's the <i>Time Hump</i> story
and the <i>Three Bears</i>

19:22.327 --> 19:24.913
and the Empire State Building
which has 102 stories,

19:24.997 --> 19:26.582
but if you throw a penny off of it,

19:26.665 --> 19:29.251
it'll go through someone's skull,
and they'd be dead.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.796
In a box, in the dirt, no light,
no breath, dead!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.548
All right, enough, Bellamy.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.343
This woman is a victim of the riot,
not a perpetrator.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.971
What you're doing here
is wildly unethical.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.600
-It's unethical to ask questions?
-She's clearly unstable at this time.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.187
So she should be committed to Psych,
is what you're telling me.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.023
What I'm telling you is,
if you expect any answers,

19:51.106 --> 19:53.692
her medical routine
needs to be re-established.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.153
She needs to be released into Gen Pop.

19:56.987 --> 20:00.490
And once she's stabilized,
she can be called back in for questioning.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.703
Fine. I'll agree to a Psych eval.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.663
You couldn't have said that
in the first place?

20:06.747 --> 20:09.124
-I'm paid by the hour.
-You're--

20:09.208 --> 20:12.836
Kidding. Jesus.
Where's your sense of humor?

20:20.427 --> 20:22.471
You're gonna share what you hear, right?

20:22.554 --> 20:26.391
I promise. Okay?
I'll tell you all the juicy details.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.602
-I don't like that word.
-What word?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.813
The "J" one. It's so... wet. I never thought about it that way.
You're right.

20:35.108 --> 20:39.821
Hellman, get me Chapman, Mendoza,
Jefferson and Nichols.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.866
Phone time, Jefferson.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.327
-Don't got no one to call.
-No?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.162
Aw...

20:47.246 --> 20:50.415
Poor you. Let's go.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.334
Leave me alone.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.212
What? I didn't quite catch that.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.175
I don't want trouble.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.427
I still didn't hear you.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.055
You should get your fat ass up
off the bed,

21:05.138 --> 21:08.642
walk over to me,
and say what you need to say.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.021
Hurry up.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.733
Look, I just wanna--

21:16.817 --> 21:18.527
Still can't hear you.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.988
Get closer.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.616
[sighs]

21:25.367 --> 21:27.494
[groaning]

21:28.120 --> 21:30.414
Ah! [ moaning]

21:31.373 --> 21:33.000
[crying]

21:34.626 --> 21:36.545
[Ginger] What the fuzz was that, Greg?

21:37.045 --> 21:40.215
Oh, she came after me.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.760
What was I supposed to do, you know?

21:43.844 --> 21:47.222
Guess she still ain't got the riot
out of her system.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.976
She's gonna pass on the phone call,
by the way.

21:51.059 --> 21:55.230
Cheese and rice!
Bring me the other three, please.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.608
And if Jefferson isn't coming, grab Hayes.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.235
Sir, yes, sir.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.487
Not funny, Hellman.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.866
[crying]

22:05.949 --> 22:07.242
Gloria, have you heard anything--

22:07.326 --> 22:10.078
Hey! You talk on the phones,
not to each other.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.748
I see you communicating,
I'm marching you back. Got me?

22:12.831 --> 22:13.665
Yeah. Sorry.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.544
Yeah, you tryin' to ruin it for everybody,
Chapman? What's the matter with you?

22:19.171 --> 22:23.216
Chapman, phone one, Mendoza, two,
Nichols, three, Hayes, four.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.844
You got ten minutes, ladies.
Make 'em count.

22:26.636 --> 22:31.516
Oh, and speak clearly. These phones are
sometimes hard for people to hear.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.562
[in Spanish] Lourdes! Oh, my God, I can't
believe I got you on the first try!

22:35.645 --> 22:37.981
Where are you? Are you at the hospital?

22:38.065 --> 22:40.358
[Nicky] Yeah,
Les Nichols' office, please?

22:40.442 --> 22:42.235
Yes, I will hold.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.237
Yeah, it's his daughter.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.824
No, no, not Sammi.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.868
Who the fuck is Sammi?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.286
It's Nicky.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.913
Rabbi Tatelbaum!

22:52.996 --> 22:56.833
Hi. It's your girl, Tova!

22:59.127 --> 23:01.046
Your favorite convert.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.423
[scoffs]

23:03.507 --> 23:05.675
Big black girl from prison?

23:05.759 --> 23:08.804
[chuckles] Yeah, right. Right!

23:08.887 --> 23:11.264
I don't know where Alex is.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.100
Dad, you know who Alex is.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.019
I'm in Max.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.897
Maximum Security. Yes.

23:19.606 --> 23:23.110
Yes. It's the prison below the camp
with the real prisoners.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.570
[crying]

23:27.072 --> 23:30.784
My baby. It's so good to hear your voice.

23:30.867 --> 23:35.038
Hey, you sound so sleepy.
Did I wake you up?

23:36.832 --> 23:38.500
What drugs they got you on?

23:38.583 --> 23:42.129
I guess he doesn't advertise it,
but I am, in fact, the fruit of his loins

23:42.212 --> 23:44.673
and I really need to talk to him,
like, uh, right now,

23:44.798 --> 23:47.092
'cause I'm kinda dealing
with a time issue.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.427
And if he doesn't want to talk to me,

23:49.511 --> 23:53.849
just tell him it's an emergency,
and he fucking owes me for abandoning me

23:53.932 --> 23:56.143
to the quixotic mercies of my cunt mother.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.271
Yes, I will hold.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.064
Why you crying?

24:02.774 --> 24:04.401
Mad at you?

24:06.403 --> 24:11.324
Yeah, you damn right. But it didn't sound
like a fight, it sounded like a ambush.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.492
[Nicky] Uh-huh.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.288
Yep. It's your bad seed calling from hell.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.498
What are they saying about us in the news?

24:19.457 --> 24:22.043
Inmate casual... Inmate casualty?

24:22.127 --> 24:25.172
Did they give a name or any information
about the inmate?

24:25.881 --> 24:28.008
So go to a computer and look it up.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.719
Okay, go to Chrome. Chrome.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.430
I mean, the Fox is fine, too.
Yeah, whatever.

24:33.513 --> 24:37.142
Look, I need an attorney.
And I'm actually innocent this time.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.643
I know, strange but true.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.354
Unnamed inmate is not a name.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.651
Can you click on another article?

24:48.111 --> 24:50.197
Please, Dad, it's important.

24:50.280 --> 24:54.034
I'm being what they call implicated.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.828
[stammers] And I need a lawyer.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.999
Why you think?
'Cause our people make the best shysters.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.793
I got you. All right.

25:03.877 --> 25:07.297
Shyster is off the acceptable list.
I got you.

25:07.380 --> 25:12.093
I will. I will be needing, um, a lawyer.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.639
As a figurehead amongst the chosen,
I figured you know a good attorney,

25:15.722 --> 25:19.476
you know, that could, um...
help a sister out.

25:19.559 --> 25:24.522
[in Spanish] Lourdes, I don't know
if I'm still getting out this summer.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.110
There might be extra charges
from this fucking riot.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.695
Pray for me.

25:31.655 --> 25:36.534
And pray that the lawyer
they assign me ain't shit.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.828
[laughs]

25:38.912 --> 25:42.082
Rabbi. Rabbi, you rule.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.794
Okay, wrap it up. Phone time's over.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.755
Thank you. Thank you.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.049
Okay. Yes.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.761
That'd be great. Okay. Mmm-hmm.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.848
[in Spanish] All right, look...

25:58.932 --> 26:02.185
Thanks, we'll talk later.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.730
We're engaged.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.275
Dad?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.069
Dad?

26:21.454 --> 26:22.289
Hey!

26:23.873 --> 26:25.667
Hey, I know you.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.419
I know her. We go way back.

26:28.378 --> 26:32.257
You messed up the self-harm, huh?
That's too bad, man.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.468
You gotta take your opportunities
when they come.

26:36.678 --> 26:40.140
[gasps] Ooh, I know her, too. Hey!

26:40.724 --> 26:42.976
This is like old home week around here.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.811
Hey!

26:47.647 --> 26:51.109
Do you have periods of dullness
or periods of very creative thinking?

26:53.194 --> 26:55.447

[Pat] Suzanne, do you hear
what she's saying to you?

You have to tell her you're not crazy.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.010
You just need your medicine.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.887
What?

28:42.971 --> 28:45.432
Tell her you need your medication.

28:45.515 --> 28:48.351
Oh, I need my medication!

28:51.229 --> 28:53.106
I'm not crazy.

-I'd also like to give you a shot.
-[Suzanne] Oh, no.

29:29.058 --> 29:32.937
It's a fast acting anti-psychotic
that should give you some relief

29:33.021 --> 29:35.940

in your system again.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.485

Just so you know...

31:27.927 --> 31:32.140
Daddy likes blondes,
so... you're not his type.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.394
Well, he's not really a he,
so she's not my type.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.230
Don't worry your pretty dyed blonde head
about it.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.652

by walking away from me?

31:44.736 --> 31:45.904

31:49.324 --> 31:53.244
Ad Seg inmates,
this is your official rec time.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.705
You will walk the perimeter
of this multi-purpose room

31:55.788 --> 32:00.168
for exactly 45 minutes, keeping a space
of at least two feet between you.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.046
You will walk briskly,
as this is your exercise,

32:03.129 --> 32:04.213
but you will not run.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.549
I repeat, you will not run.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.427
When either Garza or me
sees an inmate running,

32:10.011 --> 32:13.264

32:13.348 --> 32:14.849
If your pace

32:14.933 --> 32:17.268
is faster than the person in front of you,

32:17.352 --> 32:18.978
and you would like to pass,

32:19.062 --> 32:21.856
you pass on the left
by saying the word "passing"

32:21.940 --> 32:24.192
loudly and clearly.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.777

we see you not taking this serious, we know you're really not makin' up,

more drastic action.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.559

[Alvarez] This is supposed to attach
to something.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.537
[Ginger] You sure?
Maybe it's supposed to go

37:28.621 --> 37:30.498
all the way around and attach to itself?

37:30.581 --> 37:32.917
Well, that's impossible. It's fuzzy.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.253
Fuzzy can't stick to fuzzy.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.422
It's all loops.
It needs the rough part that's all hooks.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.133
Listen, is all this really necessary?

37:41.217 --> 37:43.678
It's protocol after an attempted suicide.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.888
-And we have to follow protocol.
-Right.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.391
You know, if you're feeling bad,

37:48.474 --> 37:51.352
I just read this book
that was really inspiring,

37:51.435 --> 37:54.188
it's called <i>Make Your Bed,</i>
written by this Navy guy.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.942
It's all about simple acts
with powerful consequences

37:58.025 --> 38:01.570
and stacking habits.
It could help you step back into life.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.407
This isn't gonna work
without the missing pieces.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.201
Sure it will. Oh! We'll just, uh...

38:09.328 --> 38:11.747
tie the knot here. See?

38:12.456 --> 38:14.792
-Is that holding you in?
-Sure.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.795
Ooh! Another good book
is <i>The Happiness Project.</i>

38:17.878 --> 38:19.297
You and your self-help books.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.465

38:21.549 --> 38:24.510

38:24.593 --> 38:27.221
Be grateful. Be mindful. Blah, blah, blah.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.597

38:28.681 --> 38:30.016
Isn't it, though?

38:30.099 --> 38:32.226

38:32.310 --> 38:34.562
[Alvarez] There. I think that's good.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.898
Wait. She can still scratch herself.
Give me one of the--

38:37.982 --> 38:40.776
Right. The gloves. There.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.947
Ow!

-[sighs] Oh, boy.

38:58.544 --> 39:02.506
Oh, no, no, no.
Keep walking. Keep walking.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.549
Shit!

39:05.176 --> 39:09.388

You know that, right? She attacked me.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.556
Uh-huh.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.684
Never noticed those hands before.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.937
Excuse me. There's only one bed here,

39:17.021 --> 39:19.231
-So strong, too.
-Suck it, Murphy.

39:27.990 --> 39:31.285

What happened to your head?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.496

Oh, this? Some bitch attacked me

up in here. [laughs]

39:39.001 --> 39:42.463
They're scared I'm gonna kick her ass
until she's inside out.

39:42.546 --> 39:46.717
Uh, Murphy, by the way,
but most people call me Badison.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.845
-'Cause my first name's Madison.
-And you're bad.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.724
Not really. I was just drawn that way.

It was a mixed bag.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.489
Yeah. I can imagine.

Anyhow...

40:22.878 --> 40:24.171
Bed.

40:27.299 --> 40:31.720
You know, I'm injured. So, uh...
So I should probably take the--

40:31.804 --> 40:34.849
No fucking way.

40:36.475 --> 40:39.854
It's been kind of a stressful day.
You know?

40:40.938 --> 40:42.565
Think I'm gonna take a nap.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.568
Good idea.

40:47.903 --> 40:50.698
Oh. Wait a minute, I didn't get your name.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.408
It's Red.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.911
Oh... Yeah, I can see that. 'Cause...

40:55.995 --> 40:58.581
What's left up there,
it's kind of reddish.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.749
Okay. I get it.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.543
It's nice to meet you, Red.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.005
Even though you got a cold heart.

41:18.684 --> 41:24.023
Flores, Chapman, Murphy, Reznikov.
Shower time.

41:26.775 --> 41:27.860
Were you in medical?

41:27.943 --> 41:29.320
-What?
-Medical.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.030
Oh. The arm? Yeah.

41:31.655 --> 41:36.035
Did you see a girl in there
with long black hair? Glasses?

41:36.118 --> 41:39.038
Except, I'm not sure
she still has glasses. Kinda pale, tall.

41:39.121 --> 41:41.540
I don't know. Maybe.
There's always people in there.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.792
Badison, shut it.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.378
I'm meetin' my new neighbors.
It's only polite.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.089
Since when you been polite? No talking.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.343
So, did you see her?

41:52.426 --> 41:55.804
I don't know. Maybe you should go
down there and check for yourself.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.390
Sure. Right.
I'll just walk down to medical and say...

42:02.019 --> 42:03.938
Judas Priest.

42:04.605 --> 42:07.316
Yeah, we got an injury
down in Ad Seg showers.

42:07.399 --> 42:11.237
She's breathin' but took a hard spill,
and hit her head and her face.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.239
She's takin' a nap on the tiles.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.698
Can somebody bring a wheelchair?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.784
I saw what you did.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.662
What? She wanted to go to medical
and find her friend.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.498
Now she's goin' to medical.
She owes me one, if you ask me.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.501
[Blanca] Got the tooth.

42:25.584 --> 42:29.672
Part of it, anyway. Looks like
it kind of cracked off at an angle.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.090
Here, I'll take it.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.343
What are you waiting for?
It's shower time.

42:34.426 --> 42:36.178
Get your clothes off,
take your showers.

42:36.262 --> 42:38.222
We'll deal with Sleeping Beauty.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.933
[Ward] At least it happened
where it's easy to hose off the tiles.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.812
[groans]

43:00.828 --> 43:03.497
-Ow, ow, ow...
-[doctor] I wanna facilitate...

43:03.581 --> 43:04.498
Hey, excuse me.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.416
Huh?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.501
Oh...

43:08.377 --> 43:10.838
Is this all of medical,
or is there another wing?

43:11.422 --> 43:15.426
Sure. Neurology is right down the hall
past the gift shop.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.594
You're making a joke.

43:16.677 --> 43:20.055
I am. This is it, sweetheart.
And you should be grateful you're here.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.433
Usually, people get turfed back
to their cells

43:22.516 --> 43:25.436
when it's full up,
no matter how bad off they are,

43:25.519 --> 43:29.565
but a lady died this morning, had
your bed, so you got some luck going.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.484
-Someone died here?
-Mmm-hmm.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.652
What did she look like?

43:35.195 --> 43:36.488
No.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.117
No. I don't want to know.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.952
You kinda don't.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.122
I don't wanna know.

43:50.836 --> 43:53.172
I wasn't paying attention.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.966
I suppose I'm preoccupied.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.136
I mean, I knew you smelled wrong,

43:59.762 --> 44:02.556
but I should have clocked you
as poison faster.

44:03.265 --> 44:06.226
That was my bad-ison.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.020
-[chuckles]
-But I'm awake now.

44:08.103 --> 44:11.482
And I may look old,
and I may look scalped,

44:11.565 --> 44:15.486
but I have enough fight left
to fucking end you

44:15.569 --> 44:18.530
if you mess with my family.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.407
[chuckles softly, growls]

44:20.491 --> 44:22.993
Look who's growlin' like a mama cat.

44:23.077 --> 44:28.040
[chuckles] Like I said,
I was just doin' her a favor.

44:28.582 --> 44:29.875
I think you're readin' it wrong.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.252
-I don't think so.
-Well,

44:32.336 --> 44:35.089
you got your opinion, and I got mine.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.634
You know what else I got? A lot of time.

44:38.717 --> 44:41.887
A lot of time under my belt
down here with the big girls.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.557
You think you're tough comin'
from the summer camp up the hill?

44:46.517 --> 44:50.145
But I seen you. You're all cookies.

44:51.063 --> 44:55.359
And you get in here, and sooner or later,
but mostly sooner...

44:55.442 --> 44:56.402
[chuckles]

44:57.027 --> 44:58.570
you crumble.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.865
That's fine.

45:02.908 --> 45:05.619
You don't need to know
how strong my girls are.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.580
<i>We have the strength of family.</i>

45:09.581 --> 45:13.502
<i>We have the strength </i>
<i>of having faced a demon and triumphed.</i>

45:15.087 --> 45:17.214
<i>We have iron wills.</i>

45:17.798 --> 45:19.550
<i>We have patience.</i>

45:20.759 --> 45:25.681
<i>We have sharp minds </i>
<i>and deep reserves of power.</i>

45:25.764 --> 45:29.101
<i>And fucking nothing to lose.</i>

45:31.061 --> 45:32.855
Yeah.

45:32.938 --> 45:36.859
You all sound terrific. Great speech.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.403
That was very compelling.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.868
[whispers] You're still cookies.

45:49.079 --> 45:52.166
[Bladt] This is fucking ridiculous.
They could be anywhere.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.585
[Rein] You wanna try that poké place
for lunch?

45:54.668 --> 45:58.046
The one that just opened downtown?
Some of the guys say it's good.

45:58.130 --> 46:00.466
They put wasabi peas in for crunch.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.342
Is that them? Bingo.

46:02.426 --> 46:05.179
Hey. Up! Get up!
How did we miss these two?

46:05.262 --> 46:09.308
-Paiz probably swept this wing.
-Paiz. On your feet. Now, inmates!

46:15.314 --> 46:17.691
Holy shit. They're deaf.

46:17.774 --> 46:18.984
-Seriously?
-Yeah, look.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.611
They're hand talking.

46:21.528 --> 46:23.572
[both grunting]

46:23.655 --> 46:28.994
[loudly] You need to stand up
and come with us.

46:29.953 --> 46:34.208
This prison has been evacuated.

46:36.335 --> 46:39.338
Jesus. They got deaf people in here?
I wonder what they did.

46:39.421 --> 46:41.924
Don't be ableist.
Deaf people can crime like anybody.

46:42.007 --> 46:44.092
Rein, when did you get so PC?

46:44.927 --> 46:48.263
I'm dating this woman
who went to Oberlin. So...

46:48.347 --> 46:51.850
-She hot?
-Yeah, ridiculous. Amazing tits.

46:52.601 --> 46:55.521
And they're real,
'cause, you know, Oberlin.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.106
[indistinct radio chatter] -I can't go back there. I can't.
-No.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.110
-Where's Alex?
-I can't do it.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.154
Shouldn't she be on this bus?
She should be.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.157
Did you see Alex?
Did they take her out?

47:07.241 --> 47:09.076
Well, this is very, very bad.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.619
-No talking.
-[Piper] Wait.

47:10.702 --> 47:13.789
We're missing someone. Another inmate
is supposed to be on this bus.

47:13.872 --> 47:17.876
Everyone who's supposed to be on is on.
Now keep quiet.

47:28.303 --> 47:33.809
[whispering] Hey. Psst. Listen to me.
We all need to get on the same page.

47:33.892 --> 47:37.729
We need to have our story straight.
One story.

47:38.438 --> 47:39.856
What story is that?

47:39.940 --> 47:44.194
We were not resisting.
We were held hostage by Piscatella.

47:44.278 --> 47:47.364
And that's why we were down there.
Pass it on. -You got that?
-That and some spit in my ear.

47:51.410 --> 47:53.078
Say it don't spray it, <i>Roja.</i>

47:54.121 --> 47:56.623
Fuck, I think they split my kneecap.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.166
Hey, Suzanne.

47:58.959 --> 48:02.254
I need to know you understand
the story we gotta tell.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.714
But it's not true.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.299
That's right.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.927
Because the true story is our secret.

48:09.011 --> 48:11.263
You can't tell anybody.
It's just for us.

48:11.346 --> 48:13.307
I don't like secrets.
They make my stomach hurt.

48:14.808 --> 48:19.855
We will tell them that Piscatella
held us hostage. That's it. Pass it on.

48:19.938 --> 48:24.359
Taystee. Taystee.
Tell them that Piscatella held us hostage.

48:24.443 --> 48:27.821
But you like stories, right?
Everybody likes stories.

48:27.904 --> 48:32.993
They... They make us feel good.
Don't you want to make people feel good?

48:33.076 --> 48:35.287
Like with the <i>Time Hump. </i>Hmm?

48:35.370 --> 48:37.914
Not all that was true,
but everybody loved it.

48:37.998 --> 48:39.750
Well, that was somewhat true.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.169
Like, the touch-touch teleporter.

48:42.252 --> 48:45.756
And Frizzy Sprockets was based
on my mommy's friend Tamara.

48:45.839 --> 48:49.009
Look. You wanna see your mama's friend,
Tamara, ever again,

48:49.092 --> 48:51.303
then stick with the story I'm tellin' you.

48:51.386 --> 48:54.014
-Tamara hit me once.
-Fuck Tamara.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.935
Suzanne, I'm tellin' you,
this is our story

48:58.018 --> 49:00.145
and you gonna get it right, you hear me?

49:00.228 --> 49:02.272
-Now, I ain't foolin' around.
-Okay.

49:02.356 --> 49:05.734
We'll use this story
or they gonna kill us.

49:05.817 --> 49:08.278
They're gonna kill us dead, Suzanne.

49:08.362 --> 49:11.823
In a box, in the dirt, no light,
no breath, dead. You want that?

49:11.907 --> 49:14.701
-No. No. I do not want that.
-No. No, you don't.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.078
No, you don't.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.289
-Now tell the story back to me.
-Okay.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.083
Cindy and I were in the closet,
sleeping.

49:21.166 --> 49:24.086
We did not go to the pool or see anything.
We don't know anything.

49:24.169 --> 49:25.796
-Piscatella?
-We don't know anything.

49:25.879 --> 49:27.881
[Black Cindy] Thank you.

49:27.964 --> 49:30.842
-It won't matter.
-If it comes up, say it anyway.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.010
Hey.

49:32.094 --> 49:35.222
We're going to tell them
Piscatella kept us hostage.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.057
-That's not the story--
-What?

49:37.140 --> 49:39.059
That's not the story I learned!

49:39.142 --> 49:41.603
-[screaming]
-You need to shut up and turn around!

49:41.687 --> 49:44.189
Okay, that's it! One inmate per row!

49:44.272 --> 49:45.691
I'm so conf...

49:45.774 --> 49:47.025
Everybody spread out!

49:47.693 --> 49:49.069
Move it!

49:52.239 --> 49:55.117
[Black Cindy] Listen.
Suzanne. Suzanne, listen.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.660
We have our story.

49:56.743 --> 49:58.286
-We have our secrets.
-Yes.

49:58.370 --> 50:01.998
I'm countin' on you, Suzanne.
You hear? I'm countin' on you?

50:02.082 --> 50:06.378
The closet. The closet. The closet.
The closet. The closet. The closet.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.923
Ah!

50:11.133 --> 50:12.467
Those are so good.

50:12.551 --> 50:16.471
I read an article that said
french fries take years off your life.

50:16.555 --> 50:18.974
But I'm not gonna think
about that right now.

50:19.057 --> 50:22.060
I am going to think about...

50:23.186 --> 50:24.563
birds.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.774
How you feeling, Suzanne?

50:28.358 --> 50:31.403
You think you might be ready
to talk to us some more?

50:31.486 --> 50:34.865
Kind of sleepy. Medicines make me sleepy.

50:41.621 --> 50:42.956
Where'd Mommy go?

50:44.583 --> 50:46.585
She's seeing her invisible mother?

50:46.668 --> 50:50.213
No, she's not seeing her mother.
That's the point.

50:50.297 --> 50:53.300
[stammers] I thought she was here.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.722
But I guess... she wasn't.

50:59.765 --> 51:02.642
-Can I lie down?
-After we talk.

51:03.477 --> 51:04.519
Suzanne.

51:05.562 --> 51:08.148
Were you in the basement room?

51:08.231 --> 51:10.275
-Pool.
-What?

51:10.358 --> 51:11.943
It was an abandoned pool.

51:12.027 --> 51:16.031
Right, okay. Were you in the pool
when the CERT team stormed?

51:16.114 --> 51:18.116
Um...

51:20.118 --> 51:22.704
It's all right, Suzanne.
You're not in any trouble.

51:23.455 --> 51:25.665
He only wants to hear your story.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.334
Story?

51:28.460 --> 51:32.964
Yes. The story. The story.
I was with Cindy.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.049
In the room?

51:35.675 --> 51:36.760
Pool.

51:36.843 --> 51:39.679
Pool, room. Were you there?

51:42.015 --> 51:43.058
No.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.726
Then where were you?

51:45.769 --> 51:47.813
With Cindy.

51:47.896 --> 51:51.274
With Cindy in the closet
around the corner.

51:51.358 --> 51:54.444
We were there the whole time.
We ain't see shit.

51:54.528 --> 51:58.990
How do you know the room the CERT team
entered was a pool, as you keep insisting?

51:59.074 --> 52:00.784
The bus!

52:00.867 --> 52:03.620
See, the ladies was talking about it
on the bus.

52:03.703 --> 52:06.540
Cindy and me, what,
we were feeling a little left out,

52:06.623 --> 52:10.085
but that's okay, 'cause it sounded like
shit got crazy down there.

52:10.168 --> 52:13.380
And I got enough crazy, you know?
I don't need any more.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.549
-But--
-[Gurin] My client gave her statement,

52:15.632 --> 52:18.927
and she's cooperated freely
and clearly, Mr. Bellamy.

52:19.010 --> 52:20.136
[Bellamy] Fine.

52:20.220 --> 52:23.223
Fine. We're done for now.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.976
So I can go home now?

52:26.059 --> 52:28.353
[alarm blares]

52:28.436 --> 52:32.315
Wait, this isn't home. This is not home.

52:32.399 --> 52:33.483
It is now.
