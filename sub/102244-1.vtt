00:34.814 --> 00:38.365
(man) <i>Less than one percent of
the population is psychopathic.</i>

00:38.398 --> 00:41.791
<i>Psychopaths often
inherit the trait</i>

00:41.823 --> 00:44.446
<i>and are incapable of love.</i>

00:44.477 --> 00:48.383
<i>They manage their relationships
with clinical precision,</i>

00:48.415 --> 00:51.805
<i>succeeding
in all walks of life.</i>

00:51.838 --> 00:56.095
<i>Psychopaths that can learn
to love are even more rare.</i>

00:56.127 --> 00:59.199
<i>As rare as a black swan.</i>

01:00.638 --> 01:01.887
It's time.

01:03.871 --> 01:05.695
I'm not dead yet.

01:05.727 --> 01:11.134
Naming a successor is a sign of
strength, not weakness, Father.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.407
You've always had more ambition
than your brother.

01:13.439 --> 01:15.550
(woman) <i>Olly is more ambitious
than you think.</i>

01:15.583 --> 01:19.167
(man) There's a difference
between ambition and pride.

01:19.199 --> 01:20.734
He's just trying to impress you.

01:20.766 --> 01:24.094
Well, no matter how hard
your brother tries,

01:24.127 --> 01:26.014
<i>he'll always be replaceable.</i>

01:26.047 --> 01:27.999
(woman) <i>Boy, does he know
you feel that way.</i>

01:28.030 --> 01:32.158
I don't care,
and neither should you.

02:08.223 --> 02:11.134
(Olly) Last one of the day,
boys. Let's light her up.

02:12.798 --> 02:14.815
Stay professional.

02:23.679 --> 02:26.141
- Morning.
- Was when I got here.

02:26.175 --> 02:28.798
- What did you offer 'em?
- Fifty fucking grand.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.718
Well, that's twice
what you paid for the delay.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.031
Yeah, I already paid 'em
a hundred.

02:32.063 --> 02:33.343
Pissed it away
on whores and vodka.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.134
Yeah, well, do you blame 'em?

02:35.167 --> 02:38.815
No. I mean, I wouldn't wanna
live in that fucking shithole.

02:38.847 --> 02:40.381
Well, they want more money.

02:40.414 --> 02:42.943
Clearly. Alright,
increase the offer,

02:42.975 --> 02:46.078
but if it goes noisy,
that's what you're here for.

02:46.110 --> 02:47.230
Grace.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.247
What's a fair price
for that village?

02:54.495 --> 02:56.605
Two hundred?

02:56.638 --> 03:01.887
OK, well, if they refuse,
cut their tongues out.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.294
(chuckles)

03:04.542 --> 03:06.495
- Is she capable of that?
- Of course.

03:06.527 --> 03:08.734
Well, if she fucks it up,
it's down to you.

03:08.767 --> 03:11.743
I just need that village
cleared today, alright?

03:11.774 --> 03:15.167
Hey, Pop, is it unprofessional
to burn him?

03:16.543 --> 03:20.605
My God, Olly. You really do
have shit for brains.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.359
(dogs bark)

03:57.502 --> 03:59.455
Enemy front!

04:03.262 --> 04:04.959
(woman screams)

04:06.845 --> 04:08.383
(man shouts)

04:08.414 --> 04:10.494
(yells)

04:11.263 --> 04:13.565
Go, go, go! Go. Up the hill.

04:13.599 --> 04:15.325
(men shouting)

04:21.180 --> 04:24.159
(man over radio) <i>Switch fire
right. Switch fire right. Out.</i>

04:24.191 --> 04:26.845
- Oh, it's just a scratch.
- (groans)

04:26.878 --> 04:28.351
You're good.

04:30.111 --> 04:32.254
(men shouting)

04:42.847 --> 04:45.246
(gunfire continues)

04:53.087 --> 04:55.102
They don't want money.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.278
They want a fight.

04:58.334 --> 05:00.991
Make a decision. Make it now.

05:03.519 --> 05:05.502
Kill the men and the boys,

05:05.535 --> 05:07.743
and leave the women
to spread the fear.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.695
(gunshot)

05:24.702 --> 05:26.686
(gunshot)

05:26.718 --> 05:29.662
(screaming)

05:42.078 --> 05:45.247
(screams)

05:47.198 --> 05:49.535
(shouting)

06:02.111 --> 06:03.869
(screaming)

06:58.111 --> 07:00.670
Welcome home, Thomas.

07:00.702 --> 07:03.038
Great to see you, Callum.
Looking good as always.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.542
You staying for Christmas?

07:04.575 --> 07:06.430
I just came
to pick something up.

07:06.462 --> 07:09.150
That's my job. Tell me what you
need. I'll organize some tea.

07:09.182 --> 07:13.502
Thanks, but I'd rather do it
myself. It's in Nanna's box.

07:13.534 --> 07:17.151
- Well, that is a surprise.
- To me as well.

07:17.182 --> 07:19.775
Be nice to have some laughter
in the house.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.151
(Thomas) Early days.

07:21.182 --> 07:23.263
I plan to keep my flat
but weekend here.

07:23.294 --> 07:24.927
If Sophie fancies it.

07:24.958 --> 07:28.671
Will she be needing
color charts for the nursery?

07:28.702 --> 07:29.950
You're worse than my mother.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.903
She would have been proud.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.375
Somehow I doubt that.

07:33.406 --> 07:35.039
Thomas, your parents were...

07:35.070 --> 07:37.150
My parents
were wildly disappointed in me.

07:37.182 --> 07:39.966
Your nanna would have approved.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.374
Did you fix the windows
in her library?

07:41.407 --> 07:42.975
All done, sir.

07:43.006 --> 07:46.047
We also planted
another 40 acres of oak.

07:46.078 --> 07:47.230
Her favorite.

07:47.263 --> 07:49.566
That would be you, sir.

07:50.847 --> 07:52.958
- Thank you, Callum.
- Of course, sir.

08:41.918 --> 08:44.159
Having second thoughts?

08:45.406 --> 08:46.591
Never.

08:46.622 --> 08:48.959
What is it, then?

08:53.886 --> 08:55.966
Did Nanna really love Grandpa?

08:56.766 --> 08:58.270
In her own way.

09:00.062 --> 09:02.622
Could you be any more obtuse?

09:02.655 --> 09:05.022
She had a special way
of seeing the world,

09:05.054 --> 09:07.422
including your grandfather.

09:07.455 --> 09:09.790
For her, it was love.

09:11.199 --> 09:12.607
You understand?

09:14.590 --> 09:16.191
Beginning to.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.006
That's why she wanted you
to have that ring.

09:19.038 --> 09:20.766
The great Henry Buckingham

09:20.799 --> 09:22.750
chopped it off
the maharaja's finger

09:22.782 --> 09:24.479
during the Indian Mutiny

09:24.510 --> 09:27.646
and bequeathed it to her
upon his passing.

09:28.862 --> 09:31.486
So the story goes.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.406
Your nanna did keep her secrets.

09:36.350 --> 09:39.070
Guess we'll never know
the truth.

09:39.102 --> 09:41.726
I know she would be pleased.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.310
Sophie is a fine choice, Thomas.

09:47.582 --> 09:48.991
Then it's time.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.558
(man) <i>This just in
from our sources.</i>

09:54.590 --> 09:56.254
Red Notices have been issued

09:56.286 --> 09:58.718
for three members
of the notorious Black Swans,

09:58.750 --> 10:01.086
a family-owned
private military company

10:01.119 --> 10:03.999
linked to alleged atrocities
in the Republic of Georgia.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.110
The three are Americans
William Lewis

10:06.142 --> 10:08.895
and his adult children,
Grace and Oliver Lewis.

10:08.926 --> 10:11.262
The family is reported
to be living in North London.

10:11.294 --> 10:13.150
They're accused
of crimes against humanity

10:13.182 --> 10:16.479
following an alleged massacre
that has only now come to light.

10:16.510 --> 10:18.495
<i>The remote area
where it happened</i>

10:18.526 --> 10:21.694
<i>is known as a corridor for
transnational gas pipelines.</i>

10:21.727 --> 10:24.222
<i>The International
Criminal Court is demanding</i>

10:24.255 --> 10:26.527
<i>that the UK extradite
the accused to the Hague</i>

10:26.558 --> 10:28.126
<i>where they will stand trial.</i>

10:28.158 --> 10:29.854
<i>The prime minister's office
has so far</i>

10:29.886 --> 10:31.678
<i>refused to comment
on the Red Notices</i>

10:31.710 --> 10:33.630
<i>or whether it plans
to serve them,</i>

10:33.662 --> 10:36.670
<i>but we're waiting for further
updates from Number Ten.</i>

10:36.702 --> 10:39.871
<i>(gunfire and screaming
on video)</i>

10:52.190 --> 10:53.854
It wasn't
what we hired him to do.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.326
Doesn't matter.

10:55.358 --> 10:58.782
He stands trial,
Lewis will say we sanctioned it.

10:58.815 --> 11:01.790
Well, you're PM.
What do you wanna do?

11:03.615 --> 11:05.566
I mean, we could kick him
into the long grass.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.446
You could do. But you do know
this is not gonna blow over?

11:08.478 --> 11:10.783
Mercenaries have been tearing
the arse out of it for decades.

11:10.815 --> 11:13.918
They may have done, but now
every fucker has a mobile phone.

11:13.950 --> 11:16.062
- Fair one.
- We could deport him.

11:16.094 --> 11:18.142
No. The Yanks
won't eat our shit.

11:18.175 --> 11:20.766
Lewis lives here.
He does his business here.

11:20.799 --> 11:22.782
He's been here
for 40 years or so.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.478
He's just bought
the Habsburg House.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.886
- What, in Hampstead Heath?
- Yeah.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.775
Clearly we're paying him
too much.

11:27.806 --> 11:29.695
Well, keeping our hands clean
is a pricey business.

11:29.726 --> 11:31.903
And at that price, I expect them
to be washed of this shite.

11:31.935 --> 11:34.270
There is a difference
between disavowing Lewis

11:34.302 --> 11:36.030
and serving him
with a Red Notice.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.598
He will expect
a level of protection.

11:37.631 --> 11:41.503
No. I cannot be seen
to protect a war criminal.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.774
So do you want me to go round
his house and arrest him?

11:43.806 --> 11:46.590
No, I never said anything
about an arrest.

11:49.502 --> 11:50.974
Lewis will have prepared
for that too.

11:51.006 --> 11:52.638
There's a reason we hired him
in the first place.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.878
And there's a reason
I hired you.

12:06.238 --> 12:07.646
Natalie, can I grab those notes?

12:07.678 --> 12:09.214
Yes, Doctor.

12:09.246 --> 12:10.239
- Thank you.
- There you go.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.126
- Hi, Dr Hart.
- Hi.

12:16.798 --> 12:18.655
Surprise.

12:20.350 --> 12:23.102
- Surprise?
- First-class ticket to Paris.

12:23.134 --> 12:25.278
Flight's at 1:30 tomorrow.

12:27.870 --> 12:30.078
Tom, that's lovely, but...

12:30.110 --> 12:33.214
I rang Dr. Wells.
She agreed to take your shifts.

12:33.247 --> 12:34.975
I haven't spoken to you
in three weeks,

12:35.006 --> 12:36.734
and the first person you call
is my consultant

12:36.766 --> 12:37.822
to change my schedule?

12:37.855 --> 12:41.758
- Yeah.
- Tom, that's not OK.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.390
You've been dying
to go to Paris.

12:43.422 --> 12:44.767
I've been dying
to spend some time with you.

12:44.799 --> 12:47.326
Good thing
we're going together, then.

12:51.134 --> 12:54.238
Tom, stop.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.670
I'm sorry.
Gotta sort something at work.

12:56.702 --> 12:58.846
- But you just got back.
- It won't take long.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.830
I've heard that one before.

13:00.862 --> 13:02.718
It'll be alright.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.919
Meet you at the airport.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.174
- I haven't said yes yet.
- Don't be late.

13:11.070 --> 13:12.671
Silly fucker.

13:13.631 --> 13:16.158
Hi, James. How's your leg today?

13:34.110 --> 13:36.478
(chatter)

13:36.510 --> 13:38.974
I need everyone out. Now.

13:39.006 --> 13:42.014
(Olly) Yeah, come on,
everyone out. Let's go.

13:44.766 --> 13:45.726
(Grace sighs)

13:45.758 --> 13:46.942
I just got a message.

13:46.974 --> 13:49.438
The SAS is about to move on us.

13:50.910 --> 13:55.230
We can book a G4
out of Farnborough,

13:55.262 --> 13:57.502
fly home,
take our chances there.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.286
England is home.

14:00.318 --> 14:05.503
Dad. After all these years,
you're still not one of them.

14:05.535 --> 14:08.670
- Never will be.
- Well, that's true.

14:08.702 --> 14:11.678
I'm one of me. So are you.

14:13.822 --> 14:17.534
Clements was just
using us anyway.

14:17.566 --> 14:21.406
No. I've been using him
for my own means.

14:21.438 --> 14:25.118
This government is addicted
to what we do for them.

14:29.790 --> 14:32.702
In three to four hours, they're
gonna break down that door

14:32.734 --> 14:34.046
and they are gonna arrest us.

14:34.078 --> 14:36.606
The last thing they want
is an arrest.

14:36.638 --> 14:40.031
If I'd seen that girl
with the phone...

14:40.063 --> 14:43.390
- Next time.
- (sighs)

14:43.422 --> 14:46.559
There won't be one
unless we do something now.

14:48.062 --> 14:50.206
What would you have us do?

14:52.254 --> 14:53.790
Enact the safeguard.

14:54.846 --> 14:56.766
Big job.

14:56.798 --> 14:59.486
Simulated it six times.

14:59.518 --> 15:02.461
Casualties always
a hundred percent.

15:04.831 --> 15:06.943
We're about to get shot
in the back.

15:06.975 --> 15:10.174
Anything else from here
is a bonus.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.918
(Grace sighs)

15:20.830 --> 15:21.982
OK.

15:40.447 --> 15:42.303
Are those pansies?

15:43.998 --> 15:45.310
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

15:45.343 --> 15:48.734
I'm with the Heath
and Hampstead Society.

15:48.766 --> 15:50.143
Each year
we select one household

15:50.175 --> 15:51.614
with the finest winter blossoms

15:51.646 --> 15:52.831
and feature it on our website.

15:52.863 --> 15:54.590
Thanks,
but we're not interested.

15:54.622 --> 15:58.366
That's a shame. You've done
such a brilliant job.

15:58.398 --> 16:01.407
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave. I'm a bit tired.

16:03.934 --> 16:08.030
Are the pansies
more fragrant to you?

16:08.062 --> 16:10.207
No, not really. Why?

16:10.239 --> 16:12.223
Some women develop
a better sense of smell

16:12.255 --> 16:13.726
when they're pregnant.

16:13.757 --> 16:16.350
That's something
to look forward to.

16:16.381 --> 16:19.261
- If you don't mind...
- How many months are you?

16:19.775 --> 16:21.470
Six.

16:21.503 --> 16:23.294
Boy or a girl?

16:23.326 --> 16:25.439
They can't tell yet.

16:30.814 --> 16:33.151
You can determine the sex
of a child at three months.

16:33.183 --> 16:36.670
And they're primroses.
Not pansies.

16:43.807 --> 16:45.823
Red 1. I'm compromised out here.

16:45.855 --> 16:48.126
- Sitrep on the woman.
- <i>Neutralized.</i>

16:48.158 --> 16:50.046
- What about the baby?
- No baby.

16:50.078 --> 16:54.046
Just a fake belly rig
concealing an automatic short.

16:56.031 --> 16:58.814
- Olivia, who is she?
- She works security for Lewis.

16:58.846 --> 17:02.717
There's a 76% probability
that he is on target.

17:03.070 --> 17:04.894
OK.

17:04.926 --> 17:07.326
Alpha. To confirm,
this is a hard arrest

17:07.358 --> 17:10.045
on a William Lewis
and known associates,

17:10.078 --> 17:11.550
aka the Black Swans,

17:11.583 --> 17:16.191
under Red Notice 790274
for crimes against humanity.

17:16.223 --> 17:17.820
(Tom) <i>Confirmed.</i>

17:17.854 --> 17:19.390
There will be no threat
to their life or reason.

17:19.423 --> 17:21.694
You will serve the Red Notice
using nonlethal means.

17:21.726 --> 17:23.871
- <i>Confirmed.</i>
- Stop fucking about.

17:23.903 --> 17:25.566
Red Notice calls for
a hard arrestment.

17:25.598 --> 17:26.847
The moment you make contact,

17:26.878 --> 17:28.671
you will fight
and you will kill him.

17:28.703 --> 17:30.238
This is London, not Londonderry.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.254
Enemy front. Enemy front.

17:32.286 --> 17:36.447
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.
I have control. Go, go, go.</i>

17:36.479 --> 17:38.494
There you go, mate.
That's yours.

17:43.774 --> 17:44.861
Coming through.

17:44.894 --> 17:47.550
Smoke. Get the smoke down now.

17:51.775 --> 17:54.751
<i>Red 6. Man down. Man down.</i>

17:54.783 --> 17:58.334
<i>Alpha. Roger that.
My call sign moving now.</i>

18:15.678 --> 18:17.310
Cover.

18:17.341 --> 18:19.230
Oh, fuck that.

18:21.694 --> 18:23.679
Sierra 1. I had to take it.

18:23.710 --> 18:25.021
<i>Alpha.</i>

18:26.878 --> 18:28.447
<i>Red 7. Held at the rear.</i>

18:28.479 --> 18:32.638
<i>Cannot make entry.
I say again: cannot make entry.</i>

18:32.670 --> 18:33.758
Fuck it.

18:38.014 --> 18:40.446
Come on, mate. Smash it.

18:42.879 --> 18:43.807
Come on.

18:43.839 --> 18:45.214
Oh, shit.

18:47.230 --> 18:48.287
Red 1. Need door entry.

18:48.318 --> 18:50.238
Alpha. Roger that.

18:50.271 --> 18:52.734
Red 3. Moving now.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.143
Clear!

19:10.367 --> 19:12.543
- (gun clicks)
- Stoppage! Stoppage!

19:16.287 --> 19:18.399
- Clear!
- Up.

19:23.103 --> 19:25.918
<i>That's Red 9.
Checking the garage. Out.</i>

19:35.165 --> 19:36.990
Don't move! Don't move!

19:48.223 --> 19:50.815
Lewis confirmed. Dining room.

19:51.678 --> 19:53.023
Any eyes on Grace?

19:53.054 --> 19:54.718
(Tom) Unsighted.

19:54.751 --> 19:57.502
<i>Sierra 1. I've got movement
on the ground floor.</i>

19:57.535 --> 20:01.054
(commander)
<i>Red 1. Check it. Out.</i>

20:01.085 --> 20:05.022
<i>Sierra 1.
That's moving up the stairwell.</i>

20:05.055 --> 20:06.781
<i>Now unsighted.</i>

20:06.814 --> 20:08.287
<i>(footsteps on stairs)</i>

20:26.910 --> 20:28.959
Just in time for lunch.

20:29.470 --> 20:31.038
Where's Grace?

20:31.071 --> 20:34.143
Upstairs. Getting dressed.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.223
Oi.

20:36.254 --> 20:38.591
Fuck off and do your job.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.847
Roger that.

20:54.334 --> 20:58.207
Wow.
It's like a fucking museum.

20:58.238 --> 21:02.718
I needed somewhere to put my
stuff. It's been a busy life.

21:02.751 --> 21:06.910
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I've got tons of this shit.

21:06.943 --> 21:09.375
I'm still going.

21:09.407 --> 21:11.327
And you're about to stop.

21:13.119 --> 21:14.845
Tom, man on! Man on!

21:24.927 --> 21:27.551
Stitched up
by a kid with a mobile.

21:27.582 --> 21:29.823
Thank fuck they didn't have 'em
in Rhodesia.

21:29.854 --> 21:32.671
(chuckles)

21:32.703 --> 21:35.391
- Good skills on this job.
- Thank you.

21:35.422 --> 21:38.142
Word has it
that Grace did the sniping.

21:38.175 --> 21:40.095
Tell 'em that I did that.

21:40.126 --> 21:43.742
If Grace sticks with that story,
I'll ensure she's looked after.

21:43.775 --> 21:45.791
What, by the PM?

21:45.822 --> 21:50.686
Politicians come and go, mate.
I'm the consistency.

21:53.342 --> 21:54.814
Grace is...

21:57.406 --> 21:58.974
Grace is good value.

22:00.126 --> 22:02.398
Every father
loves their daughter.

22:02.431 --> 22:05.822
I've never loved anybody
in my life.

22:06.430 --> 22:09.855
But Grace is special.

22:09.886 --> 22:11.806
In what way?

22:11.838 --> 22:15.455
Well, she's like me.
Only better.

22:23.743 --> 22:27.102
(Clements) <i>Grace isn't joining
us for lunch, is she, Lewis?</i>

22:27.135 --> 22:29.247
(Lewis) <i>You're gonna miss me,
George.</i>

22:29.278 --> 22:31.423
(Clements) <i>I'm not gonna miss
cleaning up your mess.</i>

22:31.454 --> 22:33.822
If you could do it
with peace, love

22:33.855 --> 22:36.862
and a steak dinner, you would.

22:36.895 --> 22:40.831
Everyone is replaceable.
Even a Black Swan.

22:48.415 --> 22:49.598
(gunshots)

22:53.919 --> 22:57.886
- Stand still! Stand still!
- Stand still! Stand still!

22:57.918 --> 23:00.062
(Tom) Turn! Show your face!

23:04.094 --> 23:06.302
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you!

23:07.230 --> 23:08.767
Grenade!

23:12.670 --> 23:15.039
(groans)

23:15.070 --> 23:17.215
(laughs)

23:17.247 --> 23:18.367
Fuck.

23:21.022 --> 23:23.871
- You alright, mate?
- Oh, yeah, living the dream.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.535
Oh, shit.

23:32.446 --> 23:34.046
Oh, cheers, mate.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.190
Ooh. Your jacket's ruined.

23:36.222 --> 23:39.839
What you gonna wear
for grouse hunting this year?

23:39.870 --> 23:41.311
Fuck off.

23:44.350 --> 23:46.719
You were supposed to use
nonlethal means.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.575
Didn't have a choice.

23:48.606 --> 23:51.967
He's right, boss. Target had
a grenade. Pulled the pin on us.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.622
Oh. Was that before or after
Tom shot her in the face?

23:54.655 --> 23:57.694
- Nasal spine, actually.
- Ha. Ha-ha-ha.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.647
And how do you expect me
to sell that up the food chain,

23:59.678 --> 24:01.182
let alone the <i>Guardian?</i>

24:01.215 --> 24:03.039
And she looked nothing
like Grace Lewis.

24:03.070 --> 24:04.959
- What?
- The woman. The one I shot.

24:04.990 --> 24:06.782
Nothing like her.

24:06.815 --> 24:09.055
We cordoned off the residence
an hour prior to the raid.

24:09.086 --> 24:10.846
(man) Everest 1
was drawing us in there.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.831
Giving Grace time to escape.

24:12.862 --> 24:15.486
OK, well,
I'll issue an all-ports warning.

24:15.519 --> 24:17.631
But this is why you're supposed
to use nonlethal means,

24:17.662 --> 24:19.807
so whoever it is
that we're looking for

24:19.838 --> 24:20.863
ends up on the floor in cuffs

24:20.894 --> 24:22.526
instead of on the floor dead!

24:22.558 --> 24:24.926
Grace isn't dead, boss.
They knew we were coming.

24:24.959 --> 24:27.583
The only question is how?

24:27.614 --> 24:30.430
Well, that's a question
for another day.

24:30.463 --> 24:32.158
You're stood down
till I fill out my report.

24:32.191 --> 24:34.782
Well, hang on, boss.
You weren't there.

24:34.815 --> 24:36.991
Order stands.
And get that sorted.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.695
Nasty, that.

24:45.758 --> 24:48.351
(SAS operator)
<i>That's Alpha now airborne. Out.</i>

24:52.574 --> 24:54.846
You alright, mate?

24:54.879 --> 24:56.254
Yeah.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.111
- That's balls, innit?
- What?

24:58.142 --> 25:00.862
- You getting stood down.
- Oh. It'll be alright.

25:01.758 --> 25:04.350
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

25:04.382 --> 25:05.822
Yeah, that blast is nothing

25:05.854 --> 25:08.478
compared to the damage
your couch has done to my back.

25:08.511 --> 25:11.102
You'll be happy to fuck off
at the end of the month, then.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.271
Eh? What, you and Soph
moving in together?

25:14.302 --> 25:16.126
More than that.

25:16.158 --> 25:19.198
Oh, Christ. Well, come on, then,
let's see it.

25:19.231 --> 25:20.830
- What?
- The ring.

25:20.862 --> 25:23.038
- It must rival Gibraltar.
- (laughs)

25:23.071 --> 25:27.007
Nah. It's just something
my nanna gave me.

25:27.038 --> 25:31.166
I'm sure Soph'll be
suitably impressed.

25:31.199 --> 25:33.598
She's quite sober
when it comes to money.

25:33.631 --> 25:35.070
Well, it's easy for you to say.

25:35.102 --> 25:36.638
My ex-missus
burned my bank statement.

25:36.670 --> 25:38.942
Dumped the ashes in my mouth.

25:38.974 --> 25:40.894
'Cause you paid for lap dances
with your credit card.

25:40.926 --> 25:43.102
Yeah, I was pissed, though,
wasn't I?

25:43.135 --> 25:44.287
Oh, man, you haven't got a clue

25:44.318 --> 25:46.142
what you're
getting yourself into.

25:46.174 --> 25:48.639
- No.
- You haven't, have you?

25:48.670 --> 25:50.142
(both laugh)

25:50.174 --> 25:51.871
It'll be alright.

25:51.902 --> 25:53.950
So, what,
you gonna leave the regiment?

25:53.982 --> 25:56.094
Of course not. It's home.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.918
Do you love her?

26:03.454 --> 26:05.215
Yeah.

26:05.246 --> 26:07.742
Mate, how long
have we known each other?

26:07.774 --> 26:09.598
Since basic. Why?

26:09.630 --> 26:12.542
In that whole time, I have never
ever known you to love anyone.

26:12.574 --> 26:16.254
- Well, this is different.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

26:17.566 --> 26:19.678
Fuck off.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.342
Go on, boys, let's go.
In the van.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.006
(man) <i>The fact that

find it disturbing?

27:18.718 --> 27:20.191
No.

27:22.910 --> 27:25.022
I should know better by now.

- I don't know, Tom.

No, never.

to really talk.

28:09.182 --> 28:11.614
Absolutely.

30:53.343 --> 30:55.806
That's why I'm taking you
to Paris.

30:58.654 --> 31:00.702
Keep on your good side.

31:55.775 --> 31:58.014
Tom, who is this woman?

31:58.527 --> 32:01.054
What woman?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.974
The one with her face plastered
all over the newspaper.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.821
- Yeah, didn't see that.
- It's hard to miss.

32:05.854 --> 32:07.135
Easier than you think.

32:07.167 --> 32:10.143
Tom, what really happened
yesterday?

32:10.175 --> 32:14.398
'Cause you can tell me.
Tom, where are you going?

32:14.430 --> 32:16.863
To the gents. I won't be long.

32:40.574 --> 32:42.462
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

32:43.807 --> 32:46.527
(ticket inspector)
Your passport?

32:46.559 --> 32:49.950
Hello? Is anyone there?

32:49.981 --> 32:50.974
(knocking)

32:51.006 --> 32:52.861
<i>Il y a quelqu'un?</i>

32:54.781 --> 32:56.287
(knocking)

32:56.319 --> 32:59.199
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to come in.

33:06.783 --> 33:08.382
Shh.

33:08.414 --> 33:12.894
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK. Shh.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.598
(woman) <i>Excusez-nous.
Allez, passe, ma chérie.</i>

33:47.230 --> 33:48.831
Anyone in there?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.374
(phone rings)

34:07.838 --> 34:09.183
Morning, mate. How are you?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.103
I have Grace Lewis
on the Eurostream

34:11.134 --> 34:13.469
to Paris Gare du Nord.

34:13.501 --> 34:15.743
- Grace Lewis?
- Train's mobile.

34:15.775 --> 34:17.534
We're approaching
the Channel Tunnel.

34:17.567 --> 34:19.583
Hold on. What are you doing
on the Eurostream?

34:27.487 --> 34:31.614
Just wait till he's older.
Takes them ages to have a pee.

34:33.757 --> 34:36.895
If that was his only flaw,
I'd marry him tomorrow.

34:39.103 --> 34:41.534
Well, it's six o'clock
somewhere.

34:42.460 --> 34:43.839
Aren't you having one?

34:49.118 --> 34:50.494
Sure.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.893
A marriage proposal?

34:52.926 --> 34:54.909
One day after he dropped a woman
on Hampstead Heath?

34:54.940 --> 34:57.087
You know Tom. He's a romantic.

34:59.007 --> 35:01.534
Well, this time, before I do
anything, I need eyes on Grace.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.254
- Have Tom confirm it.
- Alright.

35:19.135 --> 35:21.055
(text alert)

35:26.655 --> 35:29.438
- Boss wants Grace confirmed.
- <i>We're almost in the tunnel.</i>

35:29.471 --> 35:31.230
Right, then safest option,

35:31.261 --> 35:33.631
<i>just let the French
lift Grace at Gare du Nord.</i>

35:33.663 --> 35:37.471
- No, fuck it. I'll confirm her.
- Tom, wai...

35:57.663 --> 35:59.391
I've been married 53 years

35:59.422 --> 36:03.005
and I still don't understand
the old sweat.

36:03.039 --> 36:05.118
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

36:05.151 --> 36:07.007
Sorry?

36:10.270 --> 36:12.414
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

36:13.214 --> 36:16.285
- No, not really.
- Damn.

36:16.318 --> 36:18.783
I don't know.
We're just so different.

36:18.814 --> 36:20.478
In what way?

36:21.694 --> 36:24.287
He takes lives for a living.
I save them.

36:24.318 --> 36:27.102
Oh, I see. Military man, is he?

36:28.158 --> 36:30.047
It has its uses, dear.

36:30.078 --> 36:32.734
Tom pretends it doesn't
affect him, but it must do.

36:32.766 --> 36:36.671
Well, not everyone
needs a shoulder to cry on.

36:36.702 --> 36:38.461
I'd be lucky if he even shrugged
his shoulders,

36:38.494 --> 36:39.711
<i>let alone shed a tear.</i>

36:39.742 --> 36:41.341
(woman) <i>And that's a problem,
is it?</i>

36:41.374 --> 36:43.165
(Sophie) <i>Well, yeah.</i>

36:43.198 --> 36:48.222
His crazy brain has a unique
ability to drive me crazy.

36:48.255 --> 36:52.351
A man running long in the loo
is not unique.

36:52.383 --> 36:55.007
God alone knows
what they do in there.

36:55.038 --> 36:57.278
Shall I tell you what he did
to my dead cat?

36:57.310 --> 37:00.127
- Your dead cat?
- Yeah.

37:00.158 --> 37:03.007
He found Chica in the garden,

37:03.038 --> 37:05.854
brought her in my flat
draped over his arm

37:05.887 --> 37:07.711
in full rigor mortis.

37:07.743 --> 37:09.215
Oh, I see.

37:09.246 --> 37:10.302
He then proceeded to suggest

37:10.335 --> 37:12.191
we put her in the freezer

37:12.222 --> 37:13.598
until we got back from holiday.

37:13.630 --> 37:16.798
- Oh, right.
- I refused, of course.

37:16.829 --> 37:19.775
We canceled our holiday
and gave her a proper burial.

37:34.462 --> 37:36.255
- (bleeping)
- Cover.

37:39.071 --> 37:41.470
(driver)
This is a red trigger...

37:47.198 --> 37:49.023
Oh!

37:54.591 --> 37:56.351
(alarm blares)

37:57.758 --> 38:00.351
Clear the tunnel and dispatch
the fire response team.

38:09.151 --> 38:11.230
(sirens wail)

38:30.718 --> 38:32.735
Getting eyes
on the flash points now.

38:33.151 --> 38:34.238
(bleeps)

38:38.911 --> 38:40.638
(alarm blares)

39:21.918 --> 39:23.806
(sirens wail)

39:29.822 --> 39:31.711
Wow. Really?

39:31.742 --> 39:34.495
Yeah. Well,
it looked way better on him.

39:34.527 --> 39:38.302
- And the kit?
- Relax. I got you.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.886
You're only as good
as your worst day, huh?

39:52.927 --> 39:57.758
(Olly) OK, listen in.
Remember, short, sharp commands.

39:57.790 --> 40:00.638
We need
to take control immediately.

40:00.670 --> 40:05.726
If anyone disobeys, ignores,
doesn't understand, tough shit.

40:05.759 --> 40:08.383
You will make
an example of them.

40:08.414 --> 40:11.935
We need to grip that train
from the get-go. You understand?

40:11.966 --> 40:13.791
(Black Swan) Remember,
all keep switched on.

40:13.822 --> 40:16.990
Everyone, fingers out your
arses. We need to move in two.

40:18.430 --> 40:19.807
Breach! Breach!

40:19.838 --> 40:21.758
- (Olly) On me.
- (Black Swan) Come on, go!

40:24.574 --> 40:26.046
(Black Swan) Cover me.

40:36.958 --> 40:40.030
- Who the fuck was that?
- Don't know. But he's trained.

40:41.854 --> 40:43.646
Everybody back.

40:43.678 --> 40:45.182
(bleeping)

40:53.982 --> 40:55.998
(screaming)

41:07.422 --> 41:10.270
Oh, my God. What's happened? Oh.

41:16.318 --> 41:19.742
Oh, I've got...
I've got some glass in my leg.

41:19.774 --> 41:22.174
OK. Don't worry,
I'll get it out.

41:22.207 --> 41:23.710
Oh, fuck.

41:25.439 --> 41:26.878
(ringing tone)

41:28.382 --> 41:30.462
- OK.
- (text alert)

41:30.495 --> 41:33.310
Just keep still.
It's gonna be alright.

41:35.134 --> 41:37.310
<i>This is Dr. Hart.
Please leave a message.</i>

41:37.342 --> 41:40.447
Stay in your seat.
I'm coming for you.

41:40.478 --> 41:42.910
There's a player
in the battle space.

41:42.942 --> 41:44.670
He's armed and skilled.

41:44.702 --> 41:47.038
Check the tunnel, check the
train, check the passengers,

41:47.071 --> 41:48.862
and do not let him get away.

41:48.895 --> 41:51.775
- (woman) Roger. We're on it.
- (Olly) Everyone spread out.

41:51.806 --> 41:53.566
Alright.

41:53.598 --> 41:56.606
This'll stop the bleeding.
It's gonna be alright.

41:58.366 --> 42:01.054
(man) <i>Assieds-toi. Reste ici.
Les filles, non, vous asseyez.</i>

42:01.086 --> 42:02.238
<i>Asseyez-vous.</i>

42:03.518 --> 42:06.750
Everybody sit down!
Don't you fucking move!

42:09.950 --> 42:13.087
Heads down! You, eyes down now!

42:13.118 --> 42:14.911
Stay down!

42:14.942 --> 42:16.798
(gunshot)

42:16.831 --> 42:18.878
Down! Move!

42:21.246 --> 42:22.591
(screaming)

42:22.622 --> 42:25.342
If you want to live,
shut the fuck up.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.326
Don't move! Stay where you are!

42:27.358 --> 42:30.686
Everyone remain calm.
Get back in your seats.

42:30.718 --> 42:32.895
Keep your hands
above your heads.

42:34.782 --> 42:39.070
I said get the fuck
back to your seat.

42:39.102 --> 42:40.382
(gunshot)

42:40.414 --> 42:42.174
(screaming)

42:43.550 --> 42:45.758
Listen in.

42:45.790 --> 42:49.246
Do what you're told
when you're told,

42:49.278 --> 42:50.942
and that...

42:52.030 --> 42:54.302
Sit the fuck down!

42:56.415 --> 42:58.750
And that will not happen to you.

43:04.542 --> 43:05.950
(Black Swan) Heads down.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.838
(man) I just need
to get her inhaler. Please...

43:07.870 --> 43:09.535
Get back in your fucking seat.

43:09.566 --> 43:12.990
- (Olly) I need you outside.
- Yeah, alright, now.

43:18.782 --> 43:20.222
(phone rings)

43:22.303 --> 43:24.702
- Give us what you got, mate.
- (Tom) <i>Grace confirmed.</i>

43:24.734 --> 43:25.918
<i>I don't know what it means yet,</i>

43:25.951 --> 43:27.742
but it's not an escape,
it's an attack.

43:27.775 --> 43:29.374
<i>She's got support down here.</i>

43:29.406 --> 43:31.582
<i>About two dozen Swans,
all armed.</i>

43:31.615 --> 43:33.502
<i>Stand to the team.</i>

43:33.535 --> 43:35.358
<i>(screaming)</i>

43:35.390 --> 43:37.886
You gonna come out and meet us
at the point of entry, yeah?

43:37.918 --> 43:39.902
I have to find Sophie.

43:39.934 --> 43:41.374
Too many Swans, mate.
They'll smash you.

43:41.406 --> 43:42.910
Just wait till we get there.

43:42.942 --> 43:44.990
No time.
Text me when you're on site.

43:45.022 --> 43:47.134
<i>I'm gonna run a CTR.</i>

43:52.414 --> 43:54.878
If you attempt to disembark,
you'll be shot and killed,

43:54.911 --> 43:57.470
so please stay on the train.

43:57.502 --> 44:00.415
Do what you're told
when you're told.

44:00.446 --> 44:03.039
(Black Swan) Get fucking down.
Just sit down!

44:05.182 --> 44:08.990
Get down now! Be fucking quiet!

44:09.022 --> 44:11.902
If you can see my eyes,
I can see yours!

44:11.935 --> 44:14.462
Look at the fucking ground!

44:17.310 --> 44:18.911
Shit.

44:18.943 --> 44:24.318
(Black Swan) Everyone stay down,
stay calm, do not fucking move,

44:24.350 --> 44:26.846
take deep breaths,

44:26.878 --> 44:28.382
and all will be fine.

44:28.414 --> 44:31.327
Don't fuck about.
Don't make me shoot you.

44:31.359 --> 44:33.662
Stay fucking calm.

44:45.406 --> 44:47.230
(commander) <i>I don't care
what Tom wants.</i>

44:47.262 --> 44:49.438
Tell him to withdraw
from the tunnel.

44:51.838 --> 44:54.974
Well, he's already
on a close target recce. Look.

44:57.247 --> 45:01.087
Tom is putting innocent lives
in danger. Get him out.

45:01.119 --> 45:02.654
And forward me those photos.

45:02.686 --> 45:04.382
I need to run 'em
up the food chain.

45:04.414 --> 45:07.390
The PM has asked
for all the latest intelligence.

45:07.422 --> 45:09.214
There you go. Sent.

45:23.998 --> 45:26.015
Service tunnel secure,
and UK-bound tunnel blocked

45:26.047 --> 45:27.710
<i>by fire and thick smoke.</i>

45:27.742 --> 45:29.342
(Grace) <i>Roger that.
Start the drilling.</i>

45:29.374 --> 45:31.294
<i>Get me a sitrep in five.</i>

45:31.326 --> 45:34.142
<i>I want the player found

45:48.223 --> 45:51.422

(commander) <i>Alpha. All red
call signs now airborne.</i>

46:02.334 --> 46:03.487
(text alert)

46:06.046 --> 46:07.838
Guns are set.

46:08.862 --> 46:11.038
Player's running a CTR.

46:15.486 --> 46:17.662
(Olly) He's looking for holes
in your protection bubble.

46:17.694 --> 46:20.382
And a way into the carriages.

46:20.414 --> 46:22.591
Especially seven,
eight and nine.

46:23.647 --> 46:25.503
Good work.

46:50.399 --> 46:52.158
Find the player.

46:52.190 --> 46:54.463
Confiscate every phone from
every passenger in every coach.

46:54.495 --> 46:57.215
If someone refuses, shoot them.

47:09.181 --> 47:11.647
Please hand over
any electronic devices.

47:11.679 --> 47:13.342
(man) There you are.

47:19.199 --> 47:20.574
In your own time, sir.

47:26.079 --> 47:27.710
In your own time, gentlemen.

47:32.510 --> 47:34.110
Thank you.

47:41.982 --> 47:43.359
Really?

47:43.390 --> 47:46.686
- What?
- What, are you 12?

47:46.718 --> 47:49.406
Am I gonna get it back?
It cost me 500 quid.

47:54.590 --> 47:56.286
And I'm the criminal.

48:02.078 --> 48:03.901
(newsreader) <i>Some major
breaking news to bring you.</i>

48:03.934 --> 48:07.135
<i>Multiple sources are telling us
that a Eurostream train</i>

48:07.167 --> 48:09.119
has been hijacked.

48:09.151 --> 48:11.581
We have very few details so far.

48:11.614 --> 48:13.055
What we do know
is that the train

48:13.087 --> 48:14.943
was heading
for Paris Gare du Nord

48:14.975 --> 48:17.727
when it was commandeered
in the Channel Tunnel.

48:17.759 --> 48:19.839
There's no word
on who's behind it

48:19.870 --> 48:21.695
or what their motives might be,

48:21.727 --> 48:23.230
<i>but if confirmed, this would be</i>

48:23.262 --> 48:26.206
<i>a major incident
on British soil.</i>

48:26.237 --> 48:28.030
Why is she still breathing?

48:28.062 --> 48:30.750
I zapped Lewis at Hampstead
Heath, but Grace weren't in.

48:30.781 --> 48:33.822
- But how did she manage that?
- Someone might have warned her.

48:33.854 --> 48:37.150
- Someone?
- I'll find him.

48:37.183 --> 48:39.934
- Sky News has it.
- Do they have Grace?

48:39.967 --> 48:41.823
Not yet. Still speculating.

48:41.854 --> 48:43.743
Right. I'm convening Cobra.

48:46.366 --> 48:47.519
If she exposes what we've done,

48:47.551 --> 48:48.990
this is not
just a problem for you,

48:49.021 --> 48:50.878
this is a very big problem
for me.

48:50.910 --> 48:54.207
The Eurostream has stopped on
British soil, so it's your call.

48:54.239 --> 48:55.934
Do I have control?

48:55.966 --> 48:58.718
Yes. Get down there
and kill her.

49:01.566 --> 49:04.863
Listen up! I need everyone's
phones out. Phones out.

49:09.310 --> 49:12.415
- Where's your phone?
- I do not have one.

49:12.447 --> 49:14.271
I lost it during the explosion.

49:14.303 --> 49:15.966
Shame.

49:15.998 --> 49:17.247
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

49:17.279 --> 49:19.390
(whimpers)

49:23.518 --> 49:26.365
Anyone have any medical training
on this train, huh?

49:27.486 --> 49:28.735
Can you get a doctor?

49:33.567 --> 49:37.086
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4. On final
approach to the tunnel.</i>

49:49.087 --> 49:50.783
I'm a doctor.

50:04.926 --> 50:07.934
Can you fix, uh, it?

50:09.821 --> 50:12.606
(whimpers)

50:12.638 --> 50:15.518
If I can get a trauma kit and
some running water, then yeah.

50:17.534 --> 50:21.181
I'm gonna take care of you,
OK? Come on. It's alright.

50:21.214 --> 50:24.447
Come on. It's gonna be OK.

50:42.655 --> 50:43.807
Stay close.

50:45.663 --> 50:49.215
Red 2. UK-bound tunnel
compromised by fire and smoke.

50:49.247 --> 50:51.870
French tunnel compromised
by up to 24 Black Swans.

50:51.901 --> 50:55.103
All red call signs will proceed
via central service tunnel.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.525
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-5.
Final approach now.</i>

50:58.558 --> 51:01.758
(pilot 2) <i>Papa 1-6. Holding.</i>

51:01.791 --> 51:03.743
(commander)
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

51:03.775 --> 51:05.310
<i>Hold at the tunnel entrance.</i>

51:05.341 --> 51:07.743
(pilot 2) <i>Red 1-6.
Roger that. Out.</i>

51:18.271 --> 51:19.645
It's OK, it's OK.

51:21.855 --> 51:23.518
Stay there.

51:28.959 --> 51:31.325
Can we have
some privacy, please?

51:38.078 --> 51:41.022
Red 2. Fire door, 20 meters out.

51:42.463 --> 51:43.838
Everyone.

52:07.805 --> 52:09.791
Red 3. Fire door is obstructed.

52:09.822 --> 52:11.967
Needs explosive entry
and that will compromise us.

52:11.998 --> 52:14.687
All call signs
set up a control point.

52:17.054 --> 52:19.518
(girl whimpers)

52:22.687 --> 52:24.030
OK.

52:31.359 --> 52:33.598
- Any word from Tom?
- I'm waiting on a call back.

52:33.630 --> 52:35.935
- Olivia, up yet?
- No, nothing, sir.

52:43.230 --> 52:45.471
Right, listen in.
Stand to the emergency response.

52:45.502 --> 52:47.231
- I want the team in now.
- We've just set up.

52:47.262 --> 52:49.054
So's Grace.

52:49.086 --> 52:51.391
- We're completely in the blind.
- Get some fucking glasses.

52:51.423 --> 52:54.111
- They zapped the CCTV, sir.
- We need people on the ground.

52:54.142 --> 52:55.839
We need to carry out
a proper CTR.

52:55.871 --> 52:57.822
- Well, who took these, then?
- Tom.

52:57.855 --> 52:59.679
Tom?

52:59.711 --> 53:01.791
Buckingham.

53:01.822 --> 53:03.903
Was he the bloke that zapped
that woman on Hampstead Heath?

53:03.934 --> 53:07.198
- Yeah.
- Good skills for a posh twat.

53:07.229 --> 53:09.535
So, hold on a minute.
How come he's inside the cordon?

53:09.567 --> 53:13.503
He was taking his girlfriend
to Paris to propose.

53:13.534 --> 53:15.391
Well, the Swans have done him
a fucking favor, then.

53:15.423 --> 53:17.725
OK, back to what we're here for.
These photos are not enough.

53:17.758 --> 53:19.741
Well, they are today,
'cause Grace is the target.

53:19.775 --> 53:20.895
We have no idea where she is.

53:20.926 --> 53:22.270
The moment you make contact,

53:22.303 --> 53:24.541
Grace will close in
and she will fight.

53:24.575 --> 53:25.887
But today
she's got nowhere to go.

53:25.918 --> 53:27.615
My job is to rescue hostages.

53:27.646 --> 53:29.695
Not today. Hit that train now.

53:29.727 --> 53:31.391
If we do that,
we will take casualties.

53:31.422 --> 53:33.375
Just give me a moment
to plan a deliberate option...

53:33.406 --> 53:36.029
What are you, the head
of a fucking knitting circle?

53:36.062 --> 53:38.046
The Swans are split up,
two to a carriage.

53:38.079 --> 53:39.999
- Now's the time to attack.
- I don't agree with you.

53:40.031 --> 53:42.238
Well, you can disagree
all you fucking like, mate,

53:42.271 --> 53:43.871
but this is what's gonna happen.

53:43.902 --> 53:45.565
You are gonna act
like a professional soldier.

53:45.598 --> 53:47.806
You are gonna initiate
emergency response.

53:47.838 --> 53:49.469
And you are gonna kill Grace.

53:49.502 --> 53:54.335
And if you don't,
you are off and he is on.

53:54.366 --> 53:55.870
Do you understand?

54:07.038 --> 54:09.151
Oh, fucking hell.

54:15.934 --> 54:17.566
(text alert)

54:28.191 --> 54:29.374
Shit.

54:29.407 --> 54:31.198
Not right now,
if you don't mind.

54:33.247 --> 54:34.751
Here.

54:34.782 --> 54:37.054
Unscrew the toilet
and I'll get you down.

54:37.087 --> 54:38.622
No.

54:39.615 --> 54:42.814
No? What do you mean, no?

54:42.847 --> 54:44.446
I need to stay here
and help the wounded.

54:44.478 --> 54:46.335
Soph, the team
are about to hit this train,

54:46.366 --> 54:48.542
and when they do, there are
gonna be a lot more casualties.

54:48.574 --> 54:49.950
You're not gonna be one of them.

54:49.982 --> 54:51.231
Sorry.

54:51.262 --> 54:53.118
I'm staying here.

54:55.071 --> 54:57.886
I have a wounded girl here.
Save her instead.

54:57.918 --> 54:59.230
If you stay on this train,
you will die.

54:59.263 --> 55:00.895
- I am not leaving.
- Soph...

55:00.927 --> 55:03.519
I am not leaving.

55:10.142 --> 55:11.358
Roger that.

55:12.255 --> 55:13.502
Red 2. Moving now.

55:13.534 --> 55:16.382
(commander)
<i>Alpha. Good luck. Out.</i>

55:55.230 --> 55:59.166
Sierra 1.
Rear locomotive unmanned.

56:00.415 --> 56:02.398
Roger that. Proceed.

56:14.590 --> 56:16.446
(Black Swan)
What's going on in there?

56:16.479 --> 56:18.239
OK, come on. Quickly. Quickly.

56:18.270 --> 56:18.910
(Black Swan) Oi.

56:18.943 --> 56:20.159
(knocking)

56:20.190 --> 56:21.535
What's going on?

56:21.566 --> 56:23.999
That's it. There you go.

56:24.030 --> 56:26.175
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- Jesus Christ, Tom.

56:26.206 --> 56:28.126
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- What?

56:28.158 --> 56:29.822
You'd make a great father.

56:29.854 --> 56:32.095
- Well, it worked, didn't it?
- (Black Swan) Oi!

56:38.655 --> 56:42.239
- (Black Swan) Open the door!
- Knock me out.

56:42.270 --> 56:43.615
- What?
- I said open the fucking door!

56:43.646 --> 56:46.783
So it doesn't look like
I helped you.

56:46.814 --> 56:49.375
(Black Swan) Open this door now.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.198
It's a good idea.

56:51.231 --> 56:53.342
(Black Swan) The kid escaped.

56:57.055 --> 56:59.071
Up top! Contact!

57:05.822 --> 57:07.902
(commander) <i>This is Alpha.
Withdraw now.</i>

57:07.934 --> 57:10.622
Bin it! Bin it! Bin it!

57:13.502 --> 57:16.030
Coach 9. Converge. Converge!

57:16.062 --> 57:17.886
(in French)

57:20.191 --> 57:21.918
Move!

57:22.975 --> 57:24.446
Stop!

57:25.822 --> 57:27.454
Fuck.

57:28.894 --> 57:30.590
(gunfire continues)

57:30.622 --> 57:32.671
Shit.

57:40.095 --> 57:41.726
Move!

57:44.766 --> 57:46.078
Move. Move!

58:01.694 --> 58:03.326
Shit.

58:04.862 --> 58:06.238
Move!

58:12.574 --> 58:14.366
What happened here?

58:14.398 --> 58:17.566
The player breached in, smashed
the doctor, lifted the kid.

58:17.598 --> 58:20.254
He's more effective
than the SAS.

58:21.631 --> 58:24.286
I pushed them back
to the control point.

58:24.318 --> 58:27.006
Yeah, because my source told us
that they were coming.

58:27.039 --> 58:28.830
- Your fucking snide?
- He's our fucking snide.

58:28.862 --> 58:30.686
And he's a critical part
of this operation.

58:30.718 --> 58:33.886
Yeah, well, someone still
had to pull the trigger.

58:33.918 --> 58:36.190
And it's a really good skill.

58:36.222 --> 58:38.878
Now use it to find
the kid and the player.

58:38.911 --> 58:40.926
They were last seen down there.

58:43.359 --> 58:45.598
(Black Swan)
You're all doing a good job.

58:45.631 --> 58:47.455
Stay just like that

58:47.486 --> 58:50.366
and not long from now
you'll be safe at home

58:50.398 --> 58:53.215
selling your story
to the papers.

58:53.246 --> 58:55.358
Be famous, not dead.

58:57.822 --> 58:59.614
(girl gasps)

59:11.102 --> 59:13.438
- (man) That was a gang fuck.
- (commander) Who's down?

59:13.471 --> 59:15.870
- (man) It was Rich and Pat.
- (commander) Shit.

59:20.191 --> 59:22.206
So where is she?

59:22.238 --> 59:23.870
Is that really
your major concern right now?

59:23.902 --> 59:26.110
No, my major concern
is that you fucked it up.

59:26.143 --> 59:27.710
I told you it was too soon.

59:27.742 --> 59:29.470
And I told you
I wanted Grace dead.

59:29.502 --> 59:32.286
- So where is she?
- She knew we were coming.

59:34.398 --> 59:36.542
- How?
- I don't know.

59:36.574 --> 59:39.166
The Swans weren't split up
two per carriage.

59:39.198 --> 59:41.438
They were on the roof of
the train, waiting to smash us.

59:41.471 --> 59:43.934
He's right, it was a trap.

01:00:36.127 --> 01:00:37.726
(computer chimes)

01:00:39.039 --> 01:00:41.278
Who installed Skype
on an internal system?

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.238
This came in via our intranet.
Should I... Should I answer it?

01:00:47.262 --> 01:00:48.607
Yeah, go on.

01:00:48.639 --> 01:00:52.830
<i>I wanna speak
to the ground commander.</i>

01:00:52.862 --> 01:00:54.750
Major Bisset.
Special Air Service.

01:00:54.782 --> 01:00:56.190
I'm here to negotiate
a peaceful resolution.

01:00:56.222 --> 01:00:57.758
<i>Thanks to
your assault yesterday,</i>

01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:58.910
<i>we're left
with only two options.</i>

01:00:58.942 --> 01:01:00.510
Which are?

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:01.918
<i>The prime minister
can go on live TV</i>

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.518
<i>and admit that
the British government</i>

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.438
<i>ordered that clearing op
in Georgia.</i>

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:07.230
<i>Or he can outfit that
Eurocopter you flew in</i>

01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:08.350
<i>with extra fuel bladders</i>

01:01:08.382 --> 01:01:09.598
<i>and wire 500 million</i>

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.679
<i>to an account
of my designation.</i>

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.214
That's a lot of money
to organize.

01:01:13.246 --> 01:01:15.038
<i>Britgaz can manage it.</i>

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:17.471
- Why would they pay for it?
- <i>They hired us to do the job.</i>

01:01:17.503 --> 01:01:20.222
<i>Well, actually,
they hired the SAS to hire us.</i>

01:01:20.255 --> 01:01:22.718
<i>But those details are best left
for the war crimes tribunal.</i>

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.766
<i>In the event
we don't get that ransom.</i>

01:01:24.798 --> 01:01:26.622
That's really not my concern.

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:28.798
- My only job is to protect...
- <i>Protect British interests.</i>

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.839
<i>Both military and economic.
Ask Clements.</i>

01:01:31.871 --> 01:01:35.166
<i>I'm sure he's lurking
around your control point.</i>

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.559
(sighs)

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:41.822
I want
a hundred hostages released

01:01:41.854 --> 01:01:43.102
as a show of good faith.

01:01:43.135 --> 01:01:44.862
<i>Agreed.</i>

01:01:44.894 --> 01:01:48.095
<i>But you'll have to come
and get them yourself.</i>

01:01:48.127 --> 01:01:49.918
<i>And bring Clements.</i>

01:01:56.767 --> 01:01:59.070
What you fucking looking at?

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:03.423
(in French)

01:03:12.607 --> 01:03:14.495
You know she only wants you
in there so she can kill you?

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:15.838
Yeah.

01:03:18.078 --> 01:03:21.950
And the only reason I'm going
in there is to kill her first.

01:03:21.982 --> 01:03:23.135
Oh, really?

01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:25.758
How you gonna do that?

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:28.670
Find out when we get there.

01:03:28.702 --> 01:03:30.783
(Black Swan) <i>This is 1-4.
I have a weeper.</i>

01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:32.318
<i>He's hyperventilating.</i>

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.719
<i>Crying, begging,
starting to lose it.</i>

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:39.230
<i>I need someone to me now
to lift him and isolate him...</i>

01:03:39.262 --> 01:03:41.182
(in French)

01:04:18.623 --> 01:04:19.743
<i>Viens.</i>

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:33.694
<i>Viens, viens.</i>

01:04:33.726 --> 01:04:36.445
All call signs.
Rear cockpit. Go!

01:04:36.478 --> 01:04:39.421
The player's
in the rear cockpit. Go, go, go!

01:04:51.423 --> 01:04:53.247
(yells)

01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:59.774
Fuck.

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:09.310
Where's the player?

01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:11.487
He saved the girl.

01:05:12.735 --> 01:05:14.974
But stayed in the fight.

01:05:17.215 --> 01:05:19.390
- There you are.
- <i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

01:05:19.423 --> 01:05:21.598
If this little fucker
can push through their defenses,

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:22.718
then so can we.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.541
So let's crack on.

01:05:24.574 --> 01:05:25.823
Dec.

01:05:26.751 --> 01:05:28.350
We're gonna get these hostages.

01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:30.655
You're in command
till I get back.

01:05:32.703 --> 01:05:36.286
Why'd you help that man
break inside the train?

01:05:36.318 --> 01:05:38.303
I didn't. I was helping
the little girl like you asked,

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:40.447
and then a man
unscrewed the toilet.

01:05:41.118 --> 01:05:42.271
Hmm.

01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:47.774
Are you his wife?

01:05:47.806 --> 01:05:49.855
I'm not married.

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.407
You're lying.

01:05:57.438 --> 01:06:00.318
Look what he did to my face.

01:06:00.351 --> 01:06:04.094
This isn't her phone.
Just FYI.

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:10.143
Where is your real phone, hmm?

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:12.031
Lover boy call it
to arrange your escape?

01:06:12.063 --> 01:06:14.110
I didn't try to escape.

01:06:15.518 --> 01:06:17.823
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:06:20.638 --> 01:06:22.719
Take her to the toilet
and find her real phone.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.543
And stay professional.

01:07:26.783 --> 01:07:29.758
Stay professional.

01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:32.125
Have you found
her real phone yet?

01:07:32.607 --> 01:07:33.694
Not yet.

01:07:43.805 --> 01:07:45.087
(drilling)

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:17.758
(Grace)
<i>If I didn't know any better,</i>

01:08:17.791 --> 01:08:18.846
<i>I'd think you were the player.</i>

01:08:18.879 --> 01:08:21.149
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:24.925
How long have you been dating?

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.287
Never met him.

01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:29.982
But if you could be kind enough
to introduce us,

01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:32.254
I'd love
to take him out for dinner.

01:08:32.287 --> 01:08:35.484
<i>He's starting
to sound like my type.</i>

01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:56.254
<i>(drilling)</i>

01:08:57.598 --> 01:08:58.814
<i>(drilling stops)</i>

01:09:08.415 --> 01:09:10.335
Is it through?

01:09:14.142 --> 01:09:16.126
It looks like
we have the clearance.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.095
Find Grace
and tell her we're through.

01:09:20.127 --> 01:09:22.207
I'll get started on the device.

01:09:22.238 --> 01:09:23.837
(Black Swan) Roger that.

01:09:36.988 --> 01:09:38.430
Cute.

01:09:38.462 --> 01:09:41.438
- Found your phone.
- Fuck.

01:10:03.391 --> 01:10:04.895
Careful.

01:10:37.951 --> 01:10:39.582
Hello, Grace.

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:59.935
Can I offer you a drink?

01:10:59.967 --> 01:11:03.711
Ooh, yeah, I'll have...
I'll have a glass of champagne.

01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:47.550
- So where are the hostages?
- Hmm?

01:11:47.582 --> 01:11:49.118
Oh, they're not going anywhere.

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.326
So why are we here?

01:11:58.366 --> 01:12:01.534
You probably thought
that was gonna be you.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:04.351
Actually, I thought
it was gonna be you.

01:12:04.382 --> 01:12:06.238
I know that's what
you're here for.

01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:09.951
So, let's try this again,
shall we?

01:12:09.982 --> 01:12:12.766
- Grace Lewis.
- George Clements.

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:19.678
Calm down.
We have a lot to discuss.

01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:22.110
No, we don't.

01:12:22.142 --> 01:12:24.286
You hired us to do a job.

01:12:24.318 --> 01:12:26.046
Yeah, you didn't do it properly.

01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:28.447
You said clear the village,
and we did.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.782
You fucked up.
You left witnesses.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:34.142
They were supposed
to spread the fear.

01:12:34.174 --> 01:12:36.542
They spread the fear alright.

01:12:36.574 --> 01:12:38.110
Did it work?

01:12:38.143 --> 01:12:39.902
Did any other village
ever refuse

01:12:39.934 --> 01:12:42.206
to sell you their land
after that?

01:12:42.943 --> 01:12:44.415
Answer me.

01:12:44.446 --> 01:12:46.526
No, the pipeline went through.

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:50.590
Low-intensity ops.
It's a nasty business.

01:12:50.623 --> 01:12:53.759
But it's fucking effective.

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:55.679
Your friends
wrote the textbook for it.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.238
Well, perhaps
you should have read Chapter 10.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.031
"Kill Kids With Mobile Phones."

01:13:00.062 --> 01:13:02.014
(Grace) <i>Or the prime minister</i>

01:13:02.047 --> 01:13:04.606
<i>could just admit
that he hired us.</i>

01:13:04.638 --> 01:13:06.942
(Clements)
<i>Clearly he ain't gonna do that.</i>

01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:10.206
(Grace) <i>Then clearly
we have to get paid.</i>

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:14.942
Payment can be arranged.
Britgaz has got...

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.414
(Grace) <i>A pipeline
in the Channel Tunnel.</i>

01:13:16.447 --> 01:13:19.774
<i>Not many people
know about that.</i>

01:13:19.806 --> 01:13:21.022
<i>My father did.</i>

01:13:21.982 --> 01:13:23.519
<i>If you don't pay us,</i>

01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:25.982
and guarantee safe passage,

01:13:26.014 --> 01:13:30.814
I will destroy this tunnel
and... everyone in it.

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:35.486
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:13:35.518 --> 01:13:40.959
If you well and truly fuck off,
I'll get you your money,

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:42.462
and your safe passage.

01:13:42.494 --> 01:13:44.702
Agreed.

01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:47.198
But I want wire confirmation
in the next 30 minutes.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.574
OK.

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:04.414
- You get that?
- Loud and clear.

01:14:05.982 --> 01:14:08.095
All call signs,
the device is in position

01:14:08.126 --> 01:14:10.782
and the anti-tamper triggers
are set.

01:14:10.815 --> 01:14:12.639
Stand still.

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:16.894
Pull the trigger
and I'll detonate.

01:14:17.726 --> 01:14:19.742
Suicide bomber, are you?

01:14:19.774 --> 01:14:23.295
Well, we're all
about to get dead anyway.

01:14:23.326 --> 01:14:26.942
The ones that survive, enjoy.

01:14:26.974 --> 01:14:29.022
Not much joy in this job, mate.

01:14:29.055 --> 01:14:33.278
We either get we want
or we fuck you up severely.

01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:36.031
Hijack a train
under 75 meters of rock,

01:14:36.062 --> 01:14:37.790
death is the most likely result.

01:14:37.822 --> 01:14:39.710
And you and everyone else
in this tunnel

01:14:39.742 --> 01:14:41.791
will burn along with us.

01:14:43.518 --> 01:14:45.118
Drop it.

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:41.438
(newsreader) <i>Eurostream
officials have so far</i>

01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:43.966
<i>refused to say how many
passengers are involved,</i>

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:46.622
<i>but reports claim

(newsreader 2)
<i>Sources in Whitehall</i>

01:15:52.095 --> 01:15:54.462
<i>say the prime minister's

01:15:54.494 --> 01:15:57.342

<i>So he's called

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:04.734
(woman) Sir Charles Whiteside
from Britgaz, Prime Minister.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:12.094
(prime minister)
Thank you for coming.

01:16:12.126 --> 01:16:14.718
So what does your board
have to say?

01:16:16.574 --> 01:16:20.766
We've agreed your 500 million.
A bargain, really.

01:16:20.799 --> 01:16:24.190
Of course, this stays
out of the public domain.

01:16:24.222 --> 01:16:27.390
Britgaz doesn't pay ransoms,
do we?

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:28.894
Understood.

01:16:51.262 --> 01:16:53.758
(phone rings)

01:16:58.558 --> 01:16:59.646
Thank fuck you're still alive.

01:16:59.678 --> 01:17:02.590
(chuckles)

01:17:02.622 --> 01:17:04.830
Grace is gonna blow up
the tunnel.

01:17:04.862 --> 01:17:06.782
Yeah, yeah, she made
the same threat to Clements.

01:17:06.815 --> 01:17:09.695
It's not a threat.
I found the device.

01:17:09.727 --> 01:17:13.918
- Next to a gas pipeline.
- Well, can you disarm it?

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:17.150
<i>No. It has anti-tamper triggers
all over it.</i>

01:17:17.182 --> 01:17:20.319
Tell Bisset
to get the team in there now.

01:17:20.351 --> 01:17:21.886
Bisset's dead, mate.

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:26.047
- What?
- <i>Grace zapped him.</i>

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:30.879
Christ. You have control?

01:17:32.895 --> 01:17:35.262
- Yeah.
- <i>Then launch the ER yourself.</i>

01:17:35.294 --> 01:17:36.575
Clements ordered us to wait out.

01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:39.134
What, and let Grace
blow up the tunnel?

01:17:39.166 --> 01:17:41.150
Britgaz just agreed to pay her.

01:17:41.182 --> 01:17:42.974
<i>She'll trigger
the device anyway.</i>

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:45.022
This isn't about money.
It's revenge.

01:17:45.054 --> 01:17:46.526
Yeah, I know,
and if I was in their shoes,

01:17:46.558 --> 01:17:48.095
I'd be thinking the same thing.

01:17:48.127 --> 01:17:49.950
But setting off a bomb in the
Channel Tunnel, it's suicidal.

01:17:49.983 --> 01:17:52.350
She's operating
as if she's already dead.

01:17:52.382 --> 01:17:53.887
Yeah, well,
if she blows the tunnel,

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:56.222
she'd better hope Lewis
taught her how to swim out.

01:17:56.254 --> 01:18:00.382
That's the real question, mate,
how does she plan to escape?

01:18:03.134 --> 01:18:06.686
Listen... Tom, mate, just, um...

01:18:07.998 --> 01:18:09.662
find a way out of there,
alright?

01:18:09.694 --> 01:18:12.734
'Cause, I'll be honest,
I need your help, mate.

01:18:12.766 --> 01:18:15.774
Yeah. Sophie needs it more.

01:18:15.806 --> 01:18:17.983
Look, I get that you're in love
and all that.

01:18:18.015 --> 01:18:21.118
- <i>I do.</i>
- No. I just got it now.

01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:22.591
(phone rings)

01:18:24.671 --> 01:18:26.974
Yeah, alright, mate.

01:18:35.071 --> 01:18:36.223
Are you gonna blow the tunnel?

01:18:36.255 --> 01:18:37.886
You sound awfully ungrateful

01:18:37.918 --> 01:18:39.742
for someone
who just got promoted.

01:18:39.774 --> 01:18:41.726
I agreed to help you escape.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:43.518
But taking
a gas pipeline hostage

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:44.639
was never part of the plan.

01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:45.663
<i>Declan, you're just a tiny part</i>

01:18:45.695 --> 01:18:47.262
<i>of this operation.</i>

01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:48.670
Actually, no,
I'm a mission-critical part.

01:18:48.703 --> 01:18:50.270
Assuming you wanna
get out of there alive.

01:18:50.302 --> 01:18:51.966
We're already dead.

01:18:51.998 --> 01:18:54.750
And you will be too
if we don't kill this player.

01:18:57.918 --> 01:19:00.190
<i>He's one of yours, isn't he?</i>

01:19:00.223 --> 01:19:01.758
I've got him under control.

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:04.350
- The fuck you do. Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:19:04.381 --> 01:19:05.823
<i>You must be
in contact with him.</i>

01:19:05.855 --> 01:19:07.582
Yeah, I am,
but I don't know where he is.

01:19:07.614 --> 01:19:10.206
Let's start with his name.

01:19:13.407 --> 01:19:14.559
Tom.

01:19:20.926 --> 01:19:22.974
Look, I did not sign up
for this.

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:24.894
None of us did.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.622
So either you help me kill Tom

01:19:26.654 --> 01:19:29.502
or I tell Clements
you're the snide.

01:19:37.695 --> 01:19:39.934
Tom's girlfriend's on the train.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.494
(yells)

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:35.199
(text alert)

01:20:51.327 --> 01:20:52.894
(text alert)

01:20:58.239 --> 01:20:59.871
Tom!

01:20:59.903 --> 01:21:01.054
(text alert)

01:21:12.447 --> 01:21:14.335
- (text alert)
- Tom!

01:21:14.367 --> 01:21:16.926
Under train. Same as before.

01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:19.966
Tom, it's a trap!

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:54.655
Drop it.

01:21:54.687 --> 01:21:55.839
(gun clatters)

01:21:57.181 --> 01:21:58.367
(Tom) Sophie!

01:21:58.398 --> 01:21:59.518
(Sophie) Tom.

01:22:00.703 --> 01:22:03.358
Was it something I said?

01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:05.758
She'd never
leave a casualty behind.

01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:08.638
How sweet.
You know Sophie so well.

01:22:10.047 --> 01:22:12.159
The only reason I'm down here
is because of her.

01:22:12.190 --> 01:22:13.566
Sounds like the simplest thing

01:22:13.598 --> 01:22:15.358
is to offer yourself up
in exchange.

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.663
Then we'd have to
trust each other.

01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:23.391
Let her go.

01:22:23.423 --> 01:22:26.431
Once she's gone, so am I.

01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:41.663
It's not in our nature.

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:44.575
We're more alike than you know.

01:22:44.607 --> 01:22:47.166
I don't recall
torching any villages.

01:22:47.198 --> 01:22:49.054
How many people have you killed?

01:22:50.367 --> 01:22:51.550
How many?

01:22:55.678 --> 01:22:57.918
- I don't think about it.
- Neither do I.

01:22:57.951 --> 01:23:01.630
Don't think about it.
Don't dream about it.

01:23:01.662 --> 01:23:03.871
So he switches on
and he kills people.

01:23:03.903 --> 01:23:06.462
And then he switches off
and he takes you to Paris.

01:23:06.495 --> 01:23:08.607
- How romantic.
- I'll do it.

01:23:21.694 --> 01:23:24.831
Well, there's only one way
to end this.

01:23:33.503 --> 01:23:37.311
What are you doing, Tom?
What are you doing?

01:23:42.911 --> 01:23:44.958
- (gunshot)
- Tom!

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.414
Run, Sophie, run!

01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:03.805
(gas hisses)

01:24:13.534 --> 01:24:16.575
Shit.

01:24:16.607 --> 01:24:18.591
(newsreader) <i>We're hearing
reports of an explosion</i>

01:24:18.622 --> 01:24:21.631
<i>near to where a Eurostream
train was hijacked.</i>

01:24:21.663 --> 01:24:24.222
<i>The SAS counterterror team
is at the scene,</i>

01:24:24.255 --> 01:24:25.599
<i>and it's clear the situation</i>

01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.901
<i>has become
extremely dangerous now.</i>

01:24:27.934 --> 01:24:29.790
ABC, CNN also transmitting.

01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:32.062
Well, where the fuck
is Clements?

01:24:32.895 --> 01:24:34.621
(computer chimes)

01:24:36.927 --> 01:24:38.047
(SAS operator) Quiet!

01:24:38.847 --> 01:24:39.934
Quiet down.

01:24:39.967 --> 01:24:41.662
Answer it.

01:24:44.863 --> 01:24:49.438
This is Sergeant Smith.
I'm the new ground commander.

01:24:49.471 --> 01:24:50.367
What was that explosion?

01:24:50.398 --> 01:24:52.255
<i>That was your man</i>

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:55.390
<i>trying to rescue
his girlfriend.</i>

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:59.742
<i>Try that again and I'll torch
the entire tunnel.</i>

01:25:01.822 --> 01:25:02.974
(clears throat)

01:25:06.878 --> 01:25:09.694
Your money's ready for transfer.

01:25:09.727 --> 01:25:11.614
Britgaz just confirmed it.

01:25:11.647 --> 01:25:13.311
<i>I'll need an outside line</i>

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:15.327
<i>to verify
that it's reached the account.</i>

01:25:16.829 --> 01:25:18.303
Opening now.

01:25:20.191 --> 01:25:22.655
Eurocopter is fueled
and standing by.

01:25:24.991 --> 01:25:26.110
End the call.

01:25:38.046 --> 01:25:41.182
- That's it. It's uncoupled?
- Yeah. Well done.

01:25:41.215 --> 01:25:44.383
The passengers are consolidated
and we have the money.

01:25:44.414 --> 01:25:47.134
Wire everyone their cut,
including Declan.

01:25:52.094 --> 01:25:54.366
I was aiming for soft tissue.

01:25:55.295 --> 01:25:56.830
What about the player?

01:25:56.863 --> 01:25:59.710
It'll take too long to put
the fire out and confirm him.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:02.431
We should assume
he's still in the battle space.

01:26:02.463 --> 01:26:04.062
Come on.

01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:16.063
Right, Olivia, set up
our control point over there.

01:26:16.094 --> 01:26:18.270
Yeah, boss, I'm on it.

01:26:18.302 --> 01:26:19.455
I've got three sniper positions

01:26:19.486 --> 01:26:20.734
and my team's
looking for one more.

01:26:20.767 --> 01:26:22.527
- Right.
- Hey.

01:26:22.558 --> 01:26:24.574
You know, I can drop all of 'em
before they get to the heli.

01:26:24.607 --> 01:26:26.302
Just give me the word.

01:26:26.335 --> 01:26:28.414
Tom'll have his day.

01:26:30.398 --> 01:26:32.670
Dec. You alright?

01:26:32.702 --> 01:26:35.838
- Yeah, I'm fine. Course.
- Paddy.

01:26:52.062 --> 01:26:53.886
I like your hoodie.

01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:56.895
Take it off.

01:26:58.111 --> 01:26:59.453
Now.

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:16.158
(Sophie) Help!

01:27:17.118 --> 01:27:19.775
- (sobs)
- Shh!

01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:32.255
Up you go.

01:27:42.271 --> 01:27:44.222
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

01:27:44.254 --> 01:27:47.134
<i>The train is two minutes out.
Call the heli in.</i>

01:27:47.167 --> 01:27:51.871
Papa 1-4, this is Alpha.
All clear. Call in now.

01:27:51.902 --> 01:27:55.455
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4.
Roger that. On approach.</i>

01:28:12.926 --> 01:28:14.655
Put the fucking mask on.

01:28:15.103 --> 01:28:16.415
Move!

01:28:32.126 --> 01:28:33.118
Gas.

01:28:33.151 --> 01:28:34.846
(Olly) Get inside.

01:28:36.158 --> 01:28:38.494
(bleeping)

01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:40.638
Setting the anti-tamper
triggers now.

01:28:53.374 --> 01:28:55.294
(Olly) Wait.

01:28:55.327 --> 01:28:56.318
OK.

01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:57.822
(grunts)

01:29:07.262 --> 01:29:08.798
Come on, get in.

01:29:10.335 --> 01:29:11.518
Get in.

01:29:11.551 --> 01:29:14.142
Olly, get the other sled.

01:29:16.126 --> 01:29:17.726
Sophie!

01:29:18.238 --> 01:29:19.902
Go.

01:29:21.374 --> 01:29:23.710
I'll take care of him.

01:29:25.534 --> 01:29:27.294
Dad would be proud.

01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:43.839
(alarm blares)

01:30:18.718 --> 01:30:20.702
(gasps)

01:30:32.062 --> 01:30:35.742
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
Alpha has Eurostream.</i>

01:30:35.775 --> 01:30:38.686
<i>That's the cockpit unmanned.
On autopilot.</i>

01:30:38.718 --> 01:30:41.342
<i>Slowing. Slowing.</i>

01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:43.838
Slowing.

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:47.582
Stop. That's Eurostream static.

01:30:52.478 --> 01:30:56.062
If you have Grace,
take the shot.

01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:01.790
I thought she had safe passage.

01:31:01.822 --> 01:31:02.974
Change of plan.

01:31:03.006 --> 01:31:06.302
<i>If you can target her,
take the shot.</i>

01:31:08.734 --> 01:31:11.486
This is Alpha.

01:31:11.518 --> 01:31:13.471
All Sierras stand by.

01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:15.422
We're gonna drop the Swans.

01:31:19.135 --> 01:31:21.854
Stand by. Stand by.
Possible Swans in Coach 19.

01:31:21.886 --> 01:31:25.054
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.
Swans, Coach 19. Confirmed.</i>

01:31:25.086 --> 01:31:27.326
(Black Swan)
Remember what we agreed.

01:31:27.358 --> 01:31:32.863
Do what I say when I say
and we all get to go home.

01:31:32.895 --> 01:31:34.206
(phone bleeps)

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.974
Now, get your hoods up.

01:31:52.414 --> 01:31:54.399
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
this is Alpha.</i>

01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:56.542
<i>That's the hostages
exiting the Eurostream.</i>

01:31:56.575 --> 01:31:59.294
<i>Sierra call signs,
we need eyes on Grace.</i>

01:31:59.326 --> 01:32:01.406
<i>Eyes on Grace.</i>

01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:08.351
<i>All call signs,
is Grace sighted?</i>

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:18.879
<i>Sierra call signs, I repeat,

01:32:18.911 --> 01:32:21.374
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.

01:32:21.406 --> 01:32:24.382
<i>Possible Swan. Blue on black.</i>

01:32:26.942 --> 01:32:29.982
(sniper 2) <i>Possible Swan.
Grey on black.</i>

01:32:30.014 --> 01:32:33.759
(sniper 3) <i>Sierra 3.
Possible Swan. Red on black.</i>

01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:39.071
(sniper 4) <i>Sierra 1.
Female Swan. White on green.</i>

01:32:40.766 --> 01:32:42.943
Swans are confirmed, sir.

01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:45.374
- What about Grace?
- Unsighted.

01:32:48.126 --> 01:32:50.174
All call signs, I have control.

01:32:51.583 --> 01:32:55.966
<i>Stand by. Stand by. Stand by.</i>

01:32:56.415 --> 01:32:58.942
Go.

01:32:58.975 --> 01:33:00.734
(Olivia) <i>All call signs,

01:33:00.766 --> 01:33:03.422
<i>All targets down.

01:33:26.942 --> 01:33:29.822
(Declan) <i>Red 1-6.
Do you have eyes on Grace?</i>

01:33:29.855 --> 01:33:33.695
(pilot) <i>Red 1-6, Grace
unsighted. Still checking. Out.</i>

01:33:33.727 --> 01:33:36.543
Move it that way.
Move it that way.

01:33:46.078 --> 01:33:47.678
(grunts)

01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:50.558
(Sophie) Tom!

01:33:50.943 --> 01:33:52.542
Sophie!

01:33:53.598 --> 01:33:54.943
You know I'll do it.

01:33:54.975 --> 01:33:57.566
You have your money
and safe passage.

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:59.518
Just let her go.

01:34:02.878 --> 01:34:04.830
We still have more to do.

01:34:09.822 --> 01:34:12.958
(Declan) <i>Alpha.
The device has detonated.</i>

01:34:12.991 --> 01:34:17.342
<i>All call signs, I repeat,
the device has detonated.</i>

01:34:17.374 --> 01:34:19.518
<i>Clear the area now.</i>

01:34:24.286 --> 01:34:27.230
<i>Red 1-6,

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:29.790
(pilot) <i>Red 1-6.
Grace unsighted.</i>

01:34:29.822 --> 01:34:31.806
<i>I say again, Grace unsighted.</i>

01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:35.838
Looks like Grace
did a runner. Again.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.790
You fucking snide.

01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:46.750
Shit!

01:34:56.958 --> 01:34:58.654
(man) <i>This is Alpha.</i>

01:34:58.686 --> 01:35:01.023
<i>Second explosive detonation

(grunting)

01:35:16.926 --> 01:35:19.134
Killing me won't stop Tom.

01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:22.079
Perhaps this will.

01:35:22.111 --> 01:35:24.063
(screams)

01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:32.286
Sophie.

01:35:32.318 --> 01:35:35.101
Don't worry.
This will stop the bleeding.

01:35:36.318 --> 01:35:37.439
Pull.

01:35:38.623 --> 01:35:41.726
Tom, drop her.

01:35:44.255 --> 01:35:46.526
- What?
- Tom...

01:35:48.255 --> 01:35:50.015
I understand.

01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:54.815
Drop her.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.655
Go.

01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:25.182
(Declan groans)

01:36:25.214 --> 01:36:26.335
Shit.

01:36:34.686 --> 01:36:38.398
You. You've got
a decision to make.

01:36:40.894 --> 01:36:44.286
Choose wisely
and I'll help you sort this out.

01:36:44.318 --> 01:36:46.110
(laughs)

01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:53.279
Mate, I've seen the way
you sort things out.

01:36:53.311 --> 01:36:55.103
You don't give a shit
about anyone,

01:36:55.135 --> 01:36:57.661
let alone a fucking snide.

01:36:57.694 --> 01:37:00.831
I give enough of a shit
to find you.

01:37:00.863 --> 01:37:02.847
And fucking kill you.

01:37:02.879 --> 01:37:08.543
Yeah, well, when the world finds
out what you've been up to,

01:37:08.575 --> 01:37:11.647
they'll be coming after you,
not me.

01:37:14.367 --> 01:37:16.062
You cunt.

01:37:17.183 --> 01:37:18.781
(groans)

<i>By the time you watch this,

<i>My father taught me
all about these.</i>

<i>This one carries gas

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.879
<i>People are always complaining</i>

01:37:50.911 --> 01:37:52.767
<i>about the cost

<i>heating water, heating pizzas,

<i>They don't know the real cost.
None of you do. Until now.</i>

01:38:04.894 --> 01:38:07.934
<i>You said clear the village,

01:38:07.967 --> 01:38:10.207
<i>Well, you fucked up.
You left witnesses.</i>

01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:13.438
<i>They were supposed
to spread the fear.</i>

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:15.550
<i>They spread the fear alright.</i>

01:38:15.581 --> 01:38:16.863
(Grace) <i>Did it work?</i>

01:38:16.894 --> 01:38:18.527
<i>Did any other village
ever refuse</i>

01:38:20.767 --> 01:38:22.078
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:24.221
<i>No, the pipeline went through.</i>

<i>Low-intensity ops.
It's a nasty business.</i>

01:38:26.974 --> 01:38:29.247
<i>But it's fucking effective.</i>

01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:31.901
<i>Your friends
wrote the textbook for it.</i>

01:38:31.935 --> 01:38:34.590
(Clements) <i>Well, perhaps you
should have read Chapter 10.</i>

<i>"Kill Kids With Mobile Phones."</i>

01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:39.390
(Grace) <i>Or the prime minister</i>

01:38:39.421 --> 01:38:42.366

(Clements) <i>Clearly

01:39:16.191 --> 01:39:18.718
<i>and the United Kingdom
will be huge.</i>

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:22.847
Good luck with the second term.

01:41:59.455 --> 01:42:00.958
(coughs)

01:42:10.590 --> 01:42:11.838
Nicely played.

01:42:13.758 --> 01:42:15.678
It's not a game.

01:42:15.711 --> 01:42:17.598
Yes, it is, and you enjoy it.

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.295
Always have.

01:42:22.398 --> 01:42:23.710
If you were to drop me
right now,

01:42:23.743 --> 01:42:25.598
would you think twice about it?

01:42:31.998 --> 01:42:32.991
No.

01:42:33.022 --> 01:42:35.550
I'm the same way.

01:42:45.758 --> 01:42:47.965
It's a gift.

01:42:47.999 --> 01:42:50.079
A gift we both share.

01:42:52.926 --> 01:42:55.102
A gift?

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:57.790
I reckon most people
wouldn't see it that way.

01:42:57.822 --> 01:43:00.798
Most people are weak
and filled with doubt.

01:43:01.695 --> 01:43:03.325
Maybe.

01:43:04.063 --> 01:43:05.758
But they still...

01:43:07.359 --> 01:43:09.438
They still deserve...

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:12.382
(laughs)

01:43:13.246 --> 01:43:14.910
Love?

01:43:14.942 --> 01:43:16.799
I've never loved anyone
in my entire life,

01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:17.982
and neither have you.

01:43:19.966 --> 01:43:21.566
That's not true.

01:43:22.782 --> 01:43:24.062
Not any more.

01:43:24.094 --> 01:43:29.758
Tom, Sophie will eventually
leave you.

01:43:29.791 --> 01:43:32.446
'Cause she will never understand
who you really are.

01:43:32.478 --> 01:43:34.591
She understands now.

01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:38.527
You...

01:43:40.222 --> 01:43:43.038
are rare, and special.

01:43:44.702 --> 01:43:47.198
Let me help you embrace
who you really are.

01:43:48.735 --> 01:43:50.878
A true Black Swan.

01:43:57.246 --> 01:43:58.687
You're right.

01:44:00.638 --> 01:44:02.271
I am.

01:45:24.991 --> 01:45:26.750
You OK?

01:45:37.119 --> 01:45:39.487
If you ever wanna
talk about it up here...

01:45:43.262 --> 01:45:48.446
Actually, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:46:04.926 --> 01:46:07.038
Is that why you wanted
to go to Paris?

01:46:07.998 --> 01:46:09.310
Will you marry me?

01:46:22.495 --> 01:46:25.119
If I thought
I could make you happy, I would.

01:46:27.518 --> 01:46:29.182
But, Tom...

01:46:30.206 --> 01:46:32.254
you're not meant to be married.

01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:35.646
I know that now, and so do you.

01:46:43.742 --> 01:46:46.078
- I thought you understood.
- I do.

01:47:05.822 --> 01:47:07.198
Sophie...

01:47:11.646 --> 01:47:13.342
Oh, my...

01:47:15.134 --> 01:47:16.798
Are you...?

01:47:18.814 --> 01:47:20.862
It's news to me as well.

01:47:29.886 --> 01:47:33.791
I love you.
Please, marry me.

what's your response</i>

01:48:50.494 --> 01:48:52.030
<i>to the Grace Lewis video,</i>

01:48:52.062 --> 01:48:53.758
<i>which implies
Britgaz was willing</i>

<i>to pay the perpetrators

01:48:55.774 --> 01:48:57.343
(Sir Charles) <i>Clearly
the video was constructed</i>

01:48:57.375 --> 01:48:59.742
<i>by this Grace Lewis
in a pathetic attempt</i>

01:48:59.774 --> 01:49:01.982
<i>to deflect attention
from her crimes.</i>

01:49:02.014 --> 01:49:03.838
(newsreader 2) <i>So you'd support

01:49:05.822 --> 01:49:08.254
(Sir Charles) <i>Yes, as it would

<i>our own security services
were betrayed,</i>

A very wise decision, sir.

01:52:06.814 --> 01:52:10.877
who you generously supported
in his re-election campaign,

I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
