WEBVTT

00:00.969 --> 00:03.572
Mr. Mellon, are we talking
about gross incompetence

00:03.606 --> 00:06.670
inside the Justice Department
or widespread corruption?

00:06.704 --> 00:09.801
Human nature leaves
ample room for both.

00:09.836 --> 00:11.836
I don't want no problem
while I'm gone.

00:11.871 --> 00:13.769
Dean: I thought Torrio
had you on a leash.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.104
Well, he left town and
I chewed through it.

00:16.138 --> 00:17.969
(grunts)

00:18.004 --> 00:21.339
But you pay him, right? I mean,
he gets his taste no matter what.

00:21.374 --> 00:23.978
Every business has its costs.

00:24.013 --> 00:27.747
I need your help. I
must dispose of a body.

00:27.781 --> 00:29.914
It's a series of
classes intended...

00:29.948 --> 00:32.149
I know about it already.
All of it.

00:32.183 --> 00:33.715
Please come if you can.

00:33.749 --> 00:35.216
Nucky: You indicting me, Harry?

00:35.251 --> 00:38.118
- Indict Remus instead.
- That's never gonna happen.

00:38.152 --> 00:40.756
President Harding would never force Mr.
Daugherty's hand.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.757
- Unless someone made him.
- Such as?

00:42.792 --> 00:46.595
I hope to offer my services
as a fountain of information

00:46.630 --> 00:48.364
regarding the Attorney General.

00:48.399 --> 00:50.299
I don't think it's wise.

00:50.334 --> 00:52.402
Don't we both know how
to keep a secret?

00:53.638 --> 00:55.006
You put yourself on the line.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.374
I'll be making a change.

00:56.408 --> 00:58.309
You're running the
warehouse with Mickey.

00:58.343 --> 00:59.610
Thank you.

00:59.645 --> 01:01.479
Nucky Thompson,
Arnold Rothstein.

01:01.514 --> 01:03.982
They're working together.
Give me your blessing.

01:04.016 --> 01:06.018
I'll kill 'em all.

01:06.052 --> 01:08.020
(gasps) What is this?

01:08.054 --> 01:10.089
Lovely heroin.

01:10.124 --> 01:11.391
Gillian: My son is dead.

01:11.425 --> 01:14.160
And nothing will
ever bring him back.

01:21.769 --> 01:24.905
(theme music playing)

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.025 --> 02:57.926
Man: I spoke with the coroner.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.296
He made the change
you requested.

03:01.331 --> 03:03.098
(sniffles)

03:03.132 --> 03:04.866
"Accidental drowning."

03:04.934 --> 03:07.469
Mr. Whitlock made a persuasive
case for discretion.

03:07.503 --> 03:10.537
There is the grandchild
in the matter.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.042
I thought I had my son back.

03:16.077 --> 03:18.578
Then he would reach
for the needle.

03:19.847 --> 03:21.748
And nothing I could
do could stop him.

03:21.782 --> 03:24.016
Would you like a
few more minutes?

03:24.051 --> 03:26.586
Yes, that's very kind...

03:26.620 --> 03:30.323
We've made our farewells
already, I think.

03:33.161 --> 03:37.330
Would you like to say a last word, Mr.
Harrow?

03:37.365 --> 03:40.366
You two were close.

03:41.502 --> 03:44.504
Jimmy deserved better than this.

04:04.658 --> 04:07.461
(gate creaking)

04:12.359 --> 04:14.160
(flames crackling)

04:14.188 --> 04:16.123
Dean: You pour your
mash in the kettle,

04:16.156 --> 04:19.192
your corn, yeast... what have you...
mix it with the water.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.861
And you plug in the stopper,

04:20.894 --> 04:23.363
insert your tubing,

04:23.398 --> 04:25.532
and fire up the heat.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.495
(flame pops)

04:28.562 --> 04:31.631
You wanna keep it around
172, not quite boiling.

04:31.666 --> 04:34.134
As it all cools down,
drips out here,

04:34.168 --> 04:35.535
and abracadabra.

04:35.570 --> 04:38.104
- Whiskey.
- What'd I tell ya?

04:38.139 --> 04:40.540
He's not half as
dumb as he looks.

04:40.575 --> 04:42.209
Chester: What's this?

04:42.243 --> 04:44.478
Dean: We'll be out of your
hair in a minute, dear.

04:44.512 --> 04:46.847
You're welcome as a
guest in our home.

04:46.881 --> 04:49.583
- What about the smell?
- What about it?

04:49.617 --> 04:50.552
We have neighbors.

04:50.586 --> 04:52.163
Dean: Between the
cabbage and the fish

04:52.187 --> 04:53.987
in that hallway,
who's gonna notice?

04:54.022 --> 04:56.590
Besides, half of them are
doing the same thing.

04:56.624 --> 04:59.360
I got people like you all
over the North Side, George.

04:59.394 --> 05:00.994
Practically an army.

05:01.029 --> 05:02.563
Nice little sideline.

05:02.597 --> 05:05.499
Except you, of course, are
working off a debt...

05:05.533 --> 05:08.235
for my help getting rid
of that probie's body.

05:08.269 --> 05:10.838
- I understand.
- Good.

05:10.872 --> 05:13.441
I want two cases a week.

05:13.475 --> 05:15.676
That's 24 bottles.

05:17.145 --> 05:19.713
Oh, and tomorrow you're
coming with us to a meeting.

05:19.748 --> 05:22.549
Be on the corner of Wabash
and 23rd at 11:00 a.m.

05:22.584 --> 05:23.984
I have a job, sir.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.354
You'll figure something out.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.492
Peddles irons. You believe that?

05:30.560 --> 05:32.294
(laughs)

05:40.970 --> 05:44.106
9:00 a.m., the Hotel Astor.

05:44.141 --> 05:46.342
I'm on the overnight express.

05:47.911 --> 05:50.913
- New York?
- Tomorrow, just for the day.

05:50.948 --> 05:53.216
Rothstein or your
other girlfriend?

05:53.250 --> 05:54.984
Neither, actually.

05:55.019 --> 05:57.520
- Where are we with the pony?
- Hot tip?

05:57.554 --> 06:00.856
- For Emily's birthday.
- Eli: She can hardly walk.

06:02.058 --> 06:03.592
Just stating the obvious.

06:03.626 --> 06:05.093
That's what the pony's for.

06:05.128 --> 06:07.496
She'll love it. So
what do you think?

06:07.530 --> 06:10.399
Morgans are nice.
Calm disposition.

06:10.434 --> 06:11.935
Or a Shetland maybe.

06:11.969 --> 06:14.738
June's sister had one.
They can get a bit feisty.

06:14.772 --> 06:16.412
Chomped her pinky trying
to grab a carrot.

06:16.436 --> 06:17.908
We don't want to
coddle her, Eli.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.344
Leave it to me. I'll
get her all fixed up.

06:21.513 --> 06:24.882
I... I don't quite
know how to say this.

06:24.916 --> 06:26.784
Just start yammering
like always.

06:27.953 --> 06:29.854
James Darmody is dead.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.426
That is pure speculation.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.561
No. He has drowned.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.698
The death notices.

06:41.435 --> 06:44.170
"Mishap while bathing at
the home of his mother.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.474
- "Mrs. Gillian Darmody."
- Ja.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.744
What the fuck?

06:54.082 --> 06:56.083
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

06:56.117 --> 06:57.984
Don't be an idiot.

07:06.227 --> 07:08.262
- (horns honking)
- (piano playing)

07:08.296 --> 07:11.766
I mean, you walk down the street

07:11.800 --> 07:16.103
and there's these ruins
just sitting there,

07:16.138 --> 07:18.439
thousands of years old.

07:18.473 --> 07:19.874
Al: Hey!

07:19.908 --> 07:22.043
Look who's back.

07:22.077 --> 07:24.112
Hey.

07:26.148 --> 07:27.916
(kisses)

07:27.950 --> 07:29.744
So how was it?

07:29.768 --> 07:31.586
Give me a new perspective,
that's for sure.

07:31.620 --> 07:35.223
The medigans... t's a
fuckin' rat race over here.

07:35.257 --> 07:37.693
Italy, they take it slow.

07:37.727 --> 07:39.628
A little bread, a little vino.

07:39.662 --> 07:42.064
What, you want wine? We got
a whole fuckin' distillery.

07:42.098 --> 07:43.765
We don't have the feeling.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.034
He was just telling
me about the volcano.

07:46.069 --> 07:47.736
- What volcano?
- Vesuvius.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.170
That's near Naples.

07:49.205 --> 07:51.172
I know that. I was just there.

07:51.207 --> 07:53.241
He says the whole place
is falling to pieces.

07:53.275 --> 07:55.210
That's not f... I mean
the way they live.

07:55.244 --> 07:58.779
Before we hear about
the holiday...

08:00.915 --> 08:05.186
Yeah, uh, John, welcome home.

08:10.025 --> 08:12.026
So we had a little
eruption here, too.

08:12.094 --> 08:13.461
Joe Miller.

08:13.495 --> 08:15.863
- Do I know him?
- He's with O'Banion.

08:15.898 --> 08:18.799
- At least he was.
- So he's past tense.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.767
He insulted Jake,
smacked him around.

08:20.802 --> 08:22.803
And O'Banion...
how'd he take it?

08:23.838 --> 08:26.106
He's touchy. I kept it on ice.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.042
He's gonna come by the yards
tomorrow to hash it out.

08:32.981 --> 08:35.549
I didn't write 'cause I know
you was trying to relax.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.818
I mean, I know you said you
didn't want no problems,

08:38.852 --> 08:42.355
and I'm sure you're sore, but
there was nothing I could do.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.359
You did what you
thought was right.

08:46.394 --> 08:48.628
Yeah.

08:50.732 --> 08:52.633
Tomorrow, then.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.473
There's still the matter
of Tommy's guardianship.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.443
- Gillian: Whatever it costs.
- You're raising him in a whorehouse.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.511
It's a health resort.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.780
They're going to want to
inspect everything, you know.

09:07.815 --> 09:11.251
Ahem, ma'am, Mr.
Thompson is calling.

09:14.455 --> 09:16.990
Show him in.

09:26.668 --> 09:30.837
Do you know what you can always
rely on in this business?

09:30.872 --> 09:32.172
What?

09:32.206 --> 09:34.307
Sooner or later,

09:34.342 --> 09:37.310
everyone steps
through your door.

09:38.279 --> 09:40.313
Leander, would you mind

09:40.348 --> 09:43.083
if I spoke with Mrs.
Darmody alone?

09:49.991 --> 09:52.759
You're working toward something.
Remember that.

10:01.103 --> 10:03.605
I've come to offer
my condolences.

10:05.974 --> 10:07.508
How very kind.

10:07.543 --> 10:10.211
You can imagine my shock when
I saw this morning's paper.

10:10.245 --> 10:14.448
A young man cut
down in his prime.

10:16.685 --> 10:19.621
A troubled young man.

10:19.655 --> 10:24.058
Driven to narcotics,
truth be told.

10:24.092 --> 10:26.527
I hadn't even realized
he was back in town.

10:26.562 --> 10:28.963
Last week.

10:28.998 --> 10:31.899
Back from one of his excursions.

10:34.836 --> 10:36.870
I would very much liked
to have seen him.

10:36.904 --> 10:40.106
And he you, I'm sure.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.176
Things were rather
tense last time.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.212
To James.

10:49.851 --> 10:51.151
(sighs)

10:51.185 --> 10:55.990
Shall we stop now with
all this nonsense?

10:56.024 --> 10:58.292
It is nonsense, isn't it?

10:58.327 --> 11:01.029
We should really be drinking to
the sap who died in your tub.

11:01.096 --> 11:04.166
You killed my son, Nucky.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.481
- You're out of your mind.
- And I'll never see him again.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.203
A man who buried
a son himself...

11:08.238 --> 11:10.372
I had nothing to do
with any of that.

11:10.406 --> 11:12.741
To stand there and
lie to my face!

11:12.775 --> 11:14.876
After all the disappointments,

11:14.910 --> 11:16.912
- the false promises...
- I kept every one.

11:16.946 --> 11:19.081
To him and to me.

11:19.115 --> 11:22.050
Here's what I came to tell you.

11:22.085 --> 11:23.919
Whatever you're trying to pull,

11:23.953 --> 11:26.789
there's something you'd
best keep in mind...

11:26.823 --> 11:31.026
you exist in this town
because I allow you to.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.128
And all in all,
I'd say that's...

11:33.163 --> 11:38.400
Very generous of you.

11:40.136 --> 11:43.405
You'd be wise to say
that like you mean it.

11:52.282 --> 11:56.286
Well, next is the delicate
matter of the act itself.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.321
Something you're looking
forward to, is it?

11:58.356 --> 12:00.724
My concern is that it be placed

12:00.792 --> 12:03.661
within the proper moral context.

12:03.695 --> 12:06.464
I'm here to keep him
on the path, Sister.

12:08.467 --> 12:11.268
I will see you both
next Thursday.

12:13.038 --> 12:14.204
(door closes)

12:14.239 --> 12:17.441
Am I wrong or is she
flirting with me?

12:17.475 --> 12:20.278
Every time we talk, she always
brings it around to sex.

12:23.549 --> 12:26.450
- Mrs. Shearer.
- Do you have a question?

12:26.485 --> 12:28.686
I need to talk to her.

12:31.490 --> 12:33.057
Well, I have reports
to attend to

12:33.092 --> 12:36.694
and maybe a chance to
actually eat dinner, so...

12:42.434 --> 12:44.903
I'm glad you were able
to come to the classes.

12:44.937 --> 12:46.771
I hope you're finding
them useful.

12:46.806 --> 12:50.341
- If there's anything...
- My husband won't keep off me.

12:50.376 --> 12:51.743
I told him I wasn't ready.

12:51.777 --> 12:55.113
And he waited for a while,

12:55.147 --> 12:57.249
but now...

12:57.283 --> 12:59.867
Did you explain to him
that it still isn't...

12:59.999 --> 13:02.333
I don't want another child,

13:02.368 --> 13:03.935
no matter what.

13:05.905 --> 13:08.707
That's not something we're
allowed to discuss here.

13:08.741 --> 13:13.245
It's what every woman who
came tonight wants to know.

13:13.279 --> 13:15.013
I made a promise
to the sister...

13:15.048 --> 13:17.182
You came to me,
you offered help.

13:17.216 --> 13:20.318
I... there is a pamphlet
I can give you.

13:20.353 --> 13:23.655
- (sighs) - It explains
different methods...

13:23.689 --> 13:25.156
I don't need a pamphlet

13:25.224 --> 13:27.692
or some man to tell me
what I already know.

13:28.961 --> 13:32.965
When you first saw me
and I was bleeding...

13:34.768 --> 13:36.402
I wasn't...

13:38.372 --> 13:40.006
Yes?

13:40.040 --> 13:43.009
I stored the milk.

13:43.076 --> 13:45.011
I waited.

13:45.045 --> 13:48.547
It wasn't an accident.

13:49.649 --> 13:52.551
You understand?

13:52.585 --> 13:55.086
I drank it on purpose
to lose the baby.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.688
I won't go through that again.

13:57.723 --> 13:59.390
(sobs)

14:01.694 --> 14:03.194
What do you need?

14:03.228 --> 14:06.464
One of those Dutch
caps that go up here

14:06.532 --> 14:08.066
so I can control things.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.534
But I don't know how to get one.

14:09.569 --> 14:11.503
You have to ask a doctor.

14:11.537 --> 14:13.071
A doctor won't give
me a diaphragm.

14:13.105 --> 14:15.273
A doctor won't
even listen to me.

14:15.307 --> 14:17.942
Doctors only listen
to ladies like you.

14:21.614 --> 14:24.015
(slow dripping)

14:28.988 --> 14:31.090
(dripping continues)

14:40.135 --> 14:42.503
(sighs)

14:42.537 --> 14:45.072
It is okay, husband.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.042
Sleep.

14:58.754 --> 15:02.891
(distant phone ringing)

15:05.661 --> 15:08.430
Plan to take in any shows
while you're in New York?

15:08.464 --> 15:10.065
I hadn't really considered it.

15:10.099 --> 15:12.267
"Dizzy Izzy" is a lot of laughs.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.903
I could set you up
with house seats.

15:13.970 --> 15:16.639
Let's keep the
favors to a minimum.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.076
What do you do for fun, Esther?

15:20.110 --> 15:22.478
I run naked through the pages

15:22.513 --> 15:25.114
of the United States
Criminal Code.

15:25.148 --> 15:26.816
Really?

15:28.018 --> 15:31.788
I believe I can say
with some conviction

15:31.822 --> 15:34.724
that the arrangements
are in place.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.325
Where is he?

15:37.928 --> 15:41.230
Miss Randolph, do you wish to
be privy to these revelations?

15:41.264 --> 15:43.099
In for a penny.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.235
Mm, I applaud your boldness.

15:46.270 --> 15:49.238
Secretary Mellon is
in Manhattan today

15:49.272 --> 15:50.706
attending to matters

15:50.741 --> 15:53.809
particular to his
private enterprises.

15:53.844 --> 15:56.245
He will, as a creature of habit,

15:56.279 --> 15:58.214
take his luncheon
at the Union Club

15:58.248 --> 16:00.816
on 51st Street and 5th Avenue.

16:00.851 --> 16:04.953
- How do I get in there?
- You, Mr. Thompson, cannot.

16:05.021 --> 16:09.658
However, Mr. Charles
Rickson of Missouri can,

16:09.692 --> 16:13.095
owing to a reciprocal agreement
with the Kansas City Club.

16:13.129 --> 16:15.331
Charles Rickson?

16:15.365 --> 16:19.369
You have prospered mightily
in beef, Mr. Rickson,

16:19.436 --> 16:21.905
and your name is
on the register.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.740
What do I need to know?

16:23.775 --> 16:26.743
Andrew Mellon is one of the
richest men in the world.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.512
As the head of the
Treasury Department,

16:28.546 --> 16:30.947
he's responsible for
enforcing Prohibition

16:31.015 --> 16:33.012
as well as collecting
the income tax,

16:33.059 --> 16:36.119
neither of which I understand
him to be partial to.

16:36.153 --> 16:38.021
And he despises Harry Daugherty.

16:38.056 --> 16:40.858
Whom he regards as no more
than a common thief...

16:40.892 --> 16:44.795
not to cast dispersions
on our employer.

16:44.862 --> 16:46.897
Is that enough to get
Mellon to arrest Remus?

16:46.931 --> 16:49.700
The secretary's business
interests are manifold.

16:49.734 --> 16:53.103
He is prominent in
finance, steel, coal.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.674
He is also the
majority shareholder

16:56.741 --> 16:59.343
in the Old Overholt Distillery

16:59.377 --> 17:01.411
in West Overton, Pennsylvania.

17:01.446 --> 17:03.346
Andrew Mellon owns a distillery?

17:03.381 --> 17:05.549
Pointless possession
in this day and age,

17:05.583 --> 17:09.153
but it is remarkable how
large small irritations

17:09.186 --> 17:12.388
can loom in the
minds of great men.

17:15.126 --> 17:16.893
That's all you're
going to give me?

17:16.928 --> 17:19.863
Rather more than you
walked in with.

17:19.896 --> 17:22.866
Arrest will be a tribute
to your resourcefulness.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.635
You know, I don't think

17:25.670 --> 17:27.904
I do want to hear everything.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.383
- (mooing) - (overlapping
voices) Yah, yah!

17:40.418 --> 17:42.352
Ho!

17:42.387 --> 17:45.889
Come on, come on, come on.

17:45.923 --> 17:47.958
Al: You notice
anything funny lately?

17:47.993 --> 17:49.994
- Jake: What do you mean?
- Al: At work.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.363
You know, the way
people been acting.

17:52.398 --> 17:54.766
- Johnny say anything to you?
- About what?

17:54.801 --> 17:56.635
About what happened...
Joe Miller.

17:56.669 --> 17:58.137
Why? Was he sore?

17:58.171 --> 18:01.306
I don't know.
Didn't say nothing.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.975
I don't like this, Jake.

18:03.009 --> 18:04.810
It's where the meat comes from.

18:04.844 --> 18:08.013
Hitch up your pants. They're
hanging off your ass.

18:08.047 --> 18:10.115
- Boys!
- John!

18:11.050 --> 18:12.418
(kisses)

18:12.452 --> 18:16.121
- You want coffee?
- I had espresso at home.

18:16.156 --> 18:18.290
Look at this place.

18:20.326 --> 18:24.329
- You believe the stink?
- It's where the meat comes from.

18:24.397 --> 18:26.464
O'Banion.

18:34.807 --> 18:37.542
- Dean, how you been?
- John.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.311
- You know Hymie Weiss.
- Good to see you.

18:42.147 --> 18:45.416
- There's a new face.
- He's my muscle.

18:45.450 --> 18:49.252
- What's in the case?
- Tell him, George.

18:49.287 --> 18:51.621
- Irons.
- Yeah.

18:51.656 --> 18:53.957
Press you out nice and flat.

18:53.991 --> 18:55.825
- (laughs)
- Where you from?

18:55.860 --> 18:57.994
Me? Cicero.

18:58.029 --> 18:59.796
So this Joe Miller business...

18:59.831 --> 19:01.464
I've been very well behaved.

19:01.499 --> 19:04.868
- Cooled my heels waiting for you...
- I was over in Naples.

19:04.902 --> 19:06.670
- Different world, Deanie.
- Meanwhile...

19:06.704 --> 19:09.306
People there... very
gracious with each other.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.841
- You know why?
- All due respect...

19:10.875 --> 19:14.811
Because they understand
life is short.

19:15.747 --> 19:18.915
Threats? Really?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.830
You show up after months
and you got the gall...

19:20.854 --> 19:22.163
Hey! John's talking.

19:22.187 --> 19:23.864
He took a fucking barstool
to Joe Miller's head.

19:23.888 --> 19:25.533
Standing in our speak like
you own the fuckin' joint.

19:25.557 --> 19:27.197
- This is how you settle a beef...
- Yeah.

19:27.221 --> 19:28.088
When I'm the one who
kept my word, huh?

19:28.122 --> 19:31.528
- Pompeii.
- What?

19:31.563 --> 19:35.766
Pom-peii. You heard of it?

19:35.801 --> 19:40.404
The town was buried in 79 A.D.

19:42.674 --> 19:44.809
These poor fuckin' souls...

19:44.843 --> 19:46.878
for generations they're
next to this mountain.

19:46.912 --> 19:50.181
They got no idea it's
actually a volcano.

19:50.216 --> 19:54.618
One day, they're going about
their affairs and boom!

19:54.653 --> 19:57.621
The lava. Covers everything.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.424
- Not even time to run.
- Right.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.927
They're still there...
hundreds of them,

20:02.961 --> 20:06.263
frozen, like statues.

20:06.297 --> 20:09.233
One fella... a blacksmith
or something...

20:09.267 --> 20:12.403
still got the
hammer in his hand.

20:12.438 --> 20:16.240
He died doing what?

20:16.274 --> 20:18.909
Banging on some tin
for a few shekels

20:18.944 --> 20:20.711
or whatever they used.

20:20.746 --> 20:22.680
And losing that money...

20:22.714 --> 20:25.349
he was more afraid of that

20:25.417 --> 20:27.585
than losing his life.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.221
Huh?

20:34.459 --> 20:36.528
So Joe Miller.

20:36.562 --> 20:38.697
Al here's gonna
work something out.

20:38.731 --> 20:40.198
I came here to settle with you.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.000
(laughs) Well, there's
your mistake, Deanie.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.404
'Cause the person
to talk to was Al.

20:52.378 --> 20:54.813
The past is for suckers, right?

20:56.249 --> 20:58.082
Depends what happens
in the future.

20:58.117 --> 21:02.287
John said to talk,
so let's talk.

21:09.595 --> 21:11.630
Let's have a look at you.

21:19.171 --> 21:21.172
You're quite serious about this.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.508
It's wise to be.

21:23.543 --> 21:27.078
There's more blood spilled at
horse fairs than anywhere else.

21:27.113 --> 21:30.749
- Did you have one in Coleraine?
- Oh, aye.

21:30.816 --> 21:34.353
- Great gas of a day.
- (thunder rumbling)

21:35.288 --> 21:37.890
Yeah, my dad put on his best,

21:37.924 --> 21:40.459
strolled down the high
street like a grand man,

21:40.493 --> 21:42.327
jiggling the coins
in his pocket.

21:42.361 --> 21:43.828
What did he do?

21:43.863 --> 21:45.630
He was only a clerk
for the ironmongers,

21:45.665 --> 21:48.199
but he... he had a certain air.

21:48.234 --> 21:50.201
You had to admire it.

21:50.269 --> 21:53.238
And a shilling for me
to spend as I liked.

21:53.306 --> 21:54.839
Licorice rope.

21:54.873 --> 21:56.741
Fry's Chocolate Cream.

22:00.212 --> 22:03.414
What of yourself?

22:03.449 --> 22:05.750
We had a Welsh Cob for plowing.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.552
I'd ride him when I could.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.821
Till my father drank him away.

22:09.855 --> 22:13.358
I did so love the fair, though.

22:13.392 --> 22:15.860
People from miles around...

22:15.895 --> 22:18.630
old bachelors down
from the hills,

22:18.665 --> 22:20.899
tinkers on the road,

22:20.934 --> 22:23.936
dancing and songs coming
out from the pubs.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.038
Bit of life to the
world, wasn't it?

22:26.105 --> 22:28.707
We'd sneak away and wander.

22:28.742 --> 22:31.210
And my brother Eamonn...

22:32.746 --> 22:36.015
What? What of him?

22:36.049 --> 22:37.950
Nothing.

22:39.453 --> 22:41.955
He'd walk behind someone...

22:41.989 --> 22:44.924
ahem, a fat man, or bandy-legs,

22:44.959 --> 22:47.660
and imitate him when
he couldn't see.

22:47.695 --> 22:51.631
All I could do to keep from
falling in the mud laughing.

22:51.699 --> 22:53.300
(laughs)

22:56.838 --> 22:58.539
So you approve?

22:58.573 --> 23:01.208
Of Kip here? Aye.

23:01.242 --> 23:03.110
Seems right enough.

23:03.144 --> 23:05.913
Well, folks?

23:05.947 --> 23:09.483
Take him around the paddock,
see what he's like.

23:11.753 --> 23:14.388
The lady wants some
time to think it over.

23:17.258 --> 23:19.493
(chatter)

23:21.830 --> 23:23.597
Can't see a thing.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.368
In the theater, you know
there's an audience out there.

23:27.402 --> 23:30.037
Maybe you think you're
too good for the movies.

23:30.071 --> 23:31.638
Why would I think that?

23:31.672 --> 23:33.840
Something I've noticed
with you stage types.

23:33.875 --> 23:35.575
(laughs) Oh, I don't think

23:35.610 --> 23:37.578
I'm too good for anything.

23:37.645 --> 23:40.915
I mean, I love 'em.

23:40.949 --> 23:42.683
What do you love about them?

23:42.717 --> 23:44.184
I don't know.

23:44.219 --> 23:46.887
Sit in the dark,

23:46.922 --> 23:51.059
stare up into the screen,

23:51.093 --> 23:52.560
forget who you are for a while.

23:52.595 --> 23:54.796
Man: Most people say
"where you are."

23:54.830 --> 23:56.231
Pardon?

23:56.299 --> 23:59.601
You said "forget who you are."

23:59.635 --> 24:01.870
Is that what you're
trying to do?

24:01.904 --> 24:05.573
- Aren't we all?
- (chuckles)

24:05.608 --> 24:08.409
Turn left.

24:08.444 --> 24:10.511
And right.

24:10.546 --> 24:12.146
Look up.

24:13.749 --> 24:15.950
Holy thoughts.

24:17.285 --> 24:19.419
Okay, let's see how
the camera likes you.

24:19.454 --> 24:20.189
You wanna do that?

24:20.222 --> 24:22.199
Why else would anyone
schlep out to Queens?

24:22.223 --> 24:23.957
(laughing) Sassy.

24:23.992 --> 24:26.026
You know Gil Longacre?

24:26.061 --> 24:28.662
I did "Full Steam Ahead" with Mr.
King at Lasky.

24:28.697 --> 24:31.598
Freighter, stowaway,
Chinaman with a hatchet,

24:31.633 --> 24:33.534
a monkey, and a girl.

24:33.568 --> 24:35.335
Sounds like a doozy.

24:35.370 --> 24:36.870
Well, it paid for my house.

24:36.905 --> 24:38.505
You two sit there.

24:40.608 --> 24:42.309
Don't look at the lens.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.704
Keep your lips
closed when we kiss.

24:43.728 --> 24:44.593
Wait, we're kissing?

24:44.694 --> 24:46.380
And roll.

24:47.934 --> 24:50.294
All right, Gil's a charming
gambler on the run from the law.

24:50.318 --> 24:52.486
You're a showgirl
down on her luck.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.721
Not a lead, but, you know,
the funny one in the chorus.

24:54.756 --> 24:56.857
- The pony.
- Is that what they're called?

24:56.891 --> 24:58.058
Action!

24:58.092 --> 25:00.026
- (exhales)
- Is this cab taken?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.620
It sure is, and I'm
the one who took it.

25:01.644 --> 25:03.763
- Don't turn your head so far.
- Do you mind?

25:03.798 --> 25:06.099
- We're headed the same way.
- Give him some lip, blossom.

25:06.133 --> 25:06.935
Keep your face out.

25:06.968 --> 25:09.445
Ooh, you've got your nerve.
Why, I oughta...

25:09.469 --> 25:11.971
And policeman outside. He's
looking, he's looking.

25:12.005 --> 25:13.539
What are you gonna
do, Johnny Diamonds?

25:13.573 --> 25:15.875
They're after you.

25:15.909 --> 25:17.343
Policeman.

25:17.378 --> 25:20.413
Policeman. Policeman.

25:20.447 --> 25:22.548
And he's gone.

25:26.553 --> 25:29.188
- (crew laughing) - What
did I do to deserve that?

25:29.222 --> 25:31.423
- What didn't you?
- Make sure he gets the message.

25:31.457 --> 25:33.124
(crew laughs)

25:33.159 --> 25:35.560
Cabbie, St. Patrick's
and step on it.

25:35.628 --> 25:37.729
I'm late for church.

25:37.763 --> 25:40.465
(laughter)

25:40.500 --> 25:43.635
(stock ticker rattling)

26:07.494 --> 26:10.429
(faintly) Would you tell him
to turn off that ticker?

26:22.675 --> 26:25.110
(ticker stops)

26:35.154 --> 26:37.755
You don't care what
the market is doing?

26:37.790 --> 26:40.558
This is meant to be a retreat.

26:40.593 --> 26:42.660
Then I won't take up
much of your time.

26:42.695 --> 26:46.164
Why would you take up any of it?

26:46.198 --> 26:49.467
Because we have an
enemy in common.

26:49.535 --> 26:51.336
Harry Daugherty.

26:53.306 --> 26:55.206
You're not a member
of this club.

26:55.241 --> 26:58.076
I'm not a member of any club.

27:04.282 --> 27:06.150
My name is Enoch Thompson.

27:06.184 --> 27:07.885
You may have heard of me.

27:09.621 --> 27:11.588
Or not.

27:11.622 --> 27:15.758
In any case, the attorney general
and I have had dealings,

27:15.826 --> 27:18.194
but those dealings
have come to an end.

27:18.228 --> 27:20.830
And the nature of these
dealings would be?

27:20.864 --> 27:23.899
Circumvention of
the Volstead Act.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.969
Should I continue?

27:37.547 --> 27:40.048
I make no excuses for myself.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.217
I'm a businessman,

27:42.252 --> 27:43.618
a small businessman,

27:43.653 --> 27:45.787
and I'm sure you can
understand that.

27:45.822 --> 27:47.923
But for Harry Daugherty,

27:47.957 --> 27:51.193
the chief law enforcement
officer of the United States,

27:51.227 --> 27:53.929
to be involved with... to
in fact be the head of...

27:53.964 --> 27:57.199
a large criminal conspiracy,

27:57.233 --> 27:59.301
something is wrong with the country, Mr.
Secretary.

27:59.336 --> 28:00.837
Something is very wrong.

28:00.871 --> 28:04.707
Your sense of patriotism
is offended, Mr. Thompson?

28:04.742 --> 28:06.676
Isn't yours?

28:09.447 --> 28:12.449
Daugherty is nothing but a
shabby little huckster.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.285
- I've always thought so.
- The whole lot of them are.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.788
That's what democracy
gets you...

28:17.823 --> 28:21.091
bandits fighting over
a cut of the loot.

28:21.126 --> 28:22.559
The income tax.

28:22.593 --> 28:26.429
Sanctioned robbery with
no constitutional basis.

28:26.463 --> 28:29.599
- And Prohibition?
- (scoffs)

28:29.633 --> 28:31.801
A child's idea of morality.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.536
I don't envy your position.

28:34.604 --> 28:37.872
But we... I hope you'll
allow me to say "we"...

28:37.907 --> 28:39.441
can do something about that

28:39.475 --> 28:41.176
and help each other
in the bargain.

28:41.210 --> 28:44.579
You have the power to
arrest George Remus,

28:44.613 --> 28:46.848
the biggest bootlegger
in the country

28:46.882 --> 28:49.451
with direct, ongoing
ties to Daugherty

28:49.485 --> 28:51.019
and the men that work for him.

28:51.054 --> 28:54.890
Arrest Remus and force
Harry to show his hand.

28:54.924 --> 28:56.826
A man doesn't indict himself.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.762
Then you'll have something on
him to use when you need it.

28:59.796 --> 29:03.199
That's just as
valuable, maybe more.

29:06.604 --> 29:09.673
- And that would be your bargain?
- No.

29:09.707 --> 29:12.242
Your distillery. Overholt.

29:12.277 --> 29:15.345
It would stick in my craw for
the government to tell me

29:15.380 --> 29:17.614
what I could or couldn't
do with my own property,

29:17.648 --> 29:20.717
no matter how trivial it seemed.

29:20.752 --> 29:23.086
But that's how I am.

29:23.121 --> 29:25.956
It's the little things
that eat at me.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.626
And you would rectify this how?

29:28.660 --> 29:31.663
I'd run it for you.

29:31.697 --> 29:34.599
It's a field I have
some expertise in.

29:34.633 --> 29:36.768
You wouldn't know
anything about it.

29:36.835 --> 29:38.903
We'd never speak.

29:38.937 --> 29:41.339
All you'd see is the money.

29:41.373 --> 29:44.609
And there's always a
way to hide that.

29:44.643 --> 29:46.912
(sighs)

29:46.946 --> 29:48.713
(chuckles)

29:49.615 --> 29:52.417
Is that a yes?

29:52.451 --> 29:54.852
Even a perhaps?

29:54.887 --> 29:57.922
You brought some color to my day, Mr.
Thompson.

29:57.956 --> 30:00.591
And I do appreciate that.

30:03.262 --> 30:06.196
- Yes, Mr. Mellon?
- There's no cause for a scene,

30:06.231 --> 30:09.567
but this gentleman
is an interloper.

30:09.601 --> 30:11.702
Please be ready to
call the police

30:11.737 --> 30:14.639
in the event that he doesn't
leave the premises immediately.

30:18.978 --> 30:21.179
I'll see myself out.

30:24.216 --> 30:27.385
(thunder rumbling)

30:49.173 --> 30:51.341
(chuckles)

31:00.017 --> 31:01.751
(chuckles)

31:03.354 --> 31:05.655
It doesn't make sense...

31:05.690 --> 31:09.760
a pony... when there's no
telling what the future holds.

31:09.795 --> 31:13.531
What does it matter?
She'll enjoy it now.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.236
Could always take the shed and
turn it into a proper barn.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.505
Who's going to tend to him?

31:20.539 --> 31:22.073
It'll be good for Teddy.

31:22.108 --> 31:24.342
Learn how to look
after an animal.

31:25.644 --> 31:29.180
- Not that clearing out stalls is...
- Please.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.788
Something wrong?

31:36.790 --> 31:39.025
Just...

31:39.059 --> 31:40.993
you mustn't talk that way

31:41.027 --> 31:42.995
about what's good and isn't.

31:43.029 --> 31:45.698
Why not?

31:45.733 --> 31:47.834
Because they're just words

31:47.868 --> 31:50.837
and they don't mean
anything anymore.

31:59.313 --> 32:01.848
Would you teach me how to drive?

32:04.418 --> 32:06.853
Right now?

32:06.887 --> 32:08.588
No.

32:10.258 --> 32:12.192
After.

32:30.246 --> 32:33.048
- And with the added bonus of steam...
- (laughs)

32:33.082 --> 32:35.551
your only regret will be that
I didn't show up sooner.

32:35.585 --> 32:37.920
Should I put you down for
two, ma'am, or just one?

32:37.954 --> 32:40.056
- One'll be fine.
- (laughter)

32:40.090 --> 32:42.091
Scotty: And that's how
you close 'em, boys!

32:42.125 --> 32:43.892
Swell job, Ralph.

32:43.926 --> 32:45.427
One thing, though.

32:45.461 --> 32:47.362
Make sure you mention
the enamel grip,

32:47.397 --> 32:50.165
which is a lot softer on
those delicate hands.

32:50.199 --> 32:52.400
All right, who's next, huh?

32:52.435 --> 32:54.569
- George, how 'bout it?
- Yeah, come on, Georgie.

32:54.603 --> 32:56.683
- Yeah, come on. Strut your stuff.
- Come on, George.

32:56.707 --> 32:58.840
I'm not feeling my best, Mr.
Gulliver.

32:58.874 --> 33:00.775
- I haven't been sleeping.
- Ralph: Aw!

33:00.810 --> 33:02.710
A good night's rest and
a sensible breakfast.

33:02.745 --> 33:04.112
A salesman travels
on his stomach.

33:04.146 --> 33:05.981
What I like is that Malt-O-Meal.

33:06.015 --> 33:07.416
Phil, you be the customer.

33:07.450 --> 33:10.786
- Okey-doke.
- Come on, George, shake off those cobwebs.

33:19.663 --> 33:22.265
Ahem...

33:22.299 --> 33:25.134
- Good morning.
- Ain't you gonna ring the bell?

33:25.169 --> 33:27.403
(laughter)

33:28.272 --> 33:30.039
Yes.

33:33.610 --> 33:36.078
- Van Alden: Well?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

33:36.112 --> 33:38.147
The bell's on the fritz.
You'll have to knock.

33:38.181 --> 33:41.083
(laughter)

33:42.886 --> 33:45.688
May I help you?

33:45.722 --> 33:47.190
Good morning, sir. My name...

33:47.224 --> 33:50.326
Sir? Why, how dare you?

33:50.361 --> 33:53.863
Can't you see that I'm a
perky little housewife?

33:53.898 --> 33:55.832
- Huh?
- (laughter)

33:55.867 --> 33:57.901
No wonder he's hardly
making any sales.

34:01.072 --> 34:04.508
Yes, ma'am. My name
is George Mueller.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.812
I am with the
Electric Iron Comp...

34:07.846 --> 34:09.513
the Farraday Electric
Iron Company.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.849
Well, if you don't
know who you work for,

34:11.882 --> 34:13.784
then why should I care?

34:13.819 --> 34:15.719
I misspoke.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.121
I'm sorry.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.257
Ma'am, I am selling a product

34:20.292 --> 34:22.626
that can save you hours
of backbreaking work.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.928
(high-pitched) Is it a
steam-powered dildo?

34:24.962 --> 34:29.766
- (women gasp) - Because,
oh, my arm sure gets tired.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.534
- Oh!
- (laughter)

34:32.570 --> 34:35.438
- Woman: Terrible.
- No, ma'am.

34:35.473 --> 34:38.206
It's an iron.

34:38.241 --> 34:41.177
And if you'll allow
me to demonstrate...

34:41.210 --> 34:42.879
(steam hissing)

34:42.913 --> 34:45.215
this is our newest model.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.818
It has heat set...
three heat settings

34:47.853 --> 34:51.456
and an enamel handle, which is
very comfortable on the hands.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.291
This tip, as you can see...

34:53.324 --> 34:55.293
(high-pitched) What did
you say your name was?

34:55.328 --> 34:56.661
George Mueller, ma'am.

34:56.696 --> 35:00.532
And are you married?

35:00.567 --> 35:04.303
(laughter)

35:09.609 --> 35:11.811
- I am.
- Well, Mr. Mueller,

35:11.845 --> 35:15.548
if you screw as poorly as you
pitch, you really should be...

35:15.583 --> 35:18.585
(normal voice) selling dildos
because your wife could use a...

35:18.619 --> 35:20.987
- (iron hissing)
- (people screaming)

35:21.021 --> 35:23.923
- (screaming)
- (all shouting)

35:23.958 --> 35:25.225
Man: Somebody stop him!

35:30.531 --> 35:32.899
George, George, be reasonable!

35:35.769 --> 35:37.737
(roars)

35:37.771 --> 35:40.372
Hank: Hey, come
on, it was a gag!

35:40.407 --> 35:44.409
- (screaming) - Scotty:
George, please, calm down.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.847
Ah! Somebody call the cops!

35:53.485 --> 35:55.452
Ah!

35:55.486 --> 35:58.254
(Phil wailing)

36:03.795 --> 36:06.796
(screaming)

36:10.601 --> 36:14.371
(phone ringing)

36:16.074 --> 36:18.509
(sobbing)

36:18.543 --> 36:21.378
(ringing continues)

36:22.814 --> 36:26.617
(sobbing)

36:36.795 --> 36:38.629
(thunder rumbling)

36:38.663 --> 36:40.831
- (music playing)
- (both laughing)

36:46.639 --> 36:48.406
Ow!

36:49.519 --> 36:50.519
Ooh!

36:50.543 --> 36:51.643
What?

36:51.677 --> 36:56.148
I am Sheik Hous bin Farten.

36:56.182 --> 36:57.650
What?

36:57.684 --> 37:00.052
I come from the mysterious East.

37:00.086 --> 37:04.489
When my eyes go wide,
I am irresistible.

37:04.524 --> 37:06.024
Ooh!

37:06.059 --> 37:07.926
Come to me.

37:07.961 --> 37:12.264
- No.
- Come to me in Araby.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.167
- (women giggling)
- Silence! Silence!

37:15.201 --> 37:19.004
None may laugh at bin Farten.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.939
(women laughing)

37:20.974 --> 37:23.676
- Billie: What?
- (sniffing)

37:23.710 --> 37:25.244
What's that smell?

37:25.279 --> 37:28.281
(knocking at door)

37:32.353 --> 37:34.487
(laughing)

37:36.590 --> 37:38.358
Oh. Hello.

37:38.392 --> 37:42.095
(Billie laughing) No, don't...

37:42.129 --> 37:46.433
I said drink it.
Don't blow on it.

37:49.904 --> 37:51.738
Gus!

37:51.772 --> 37:53.139
(laughing)

37:53.173 --> 37:56.743
I didn't know you were in town.

37:56.777 --> 37:59.212
- Ooh.
- Just thought I'd drop by the oasis.

37:59.246 --> 38:01.347
Have a drink. We're celebrating.

38:01.382 --> 38:04.016
- Bill's gonna be a movie star.
- I don't know about that.

38:04.051 --> 38:07.486
Well, she tested for Clifton
King and he loved her.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.388
And now we're all boiled!
(laughing)

38:10.423 --> 38:12.791
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

38:12.826 --> 38:14.426
I haven't met the sheik.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.362
- Oh, this is Gilbert Longacre.
- Viola: He's a movie star, too.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.163
I've got a picture
coming out next month.

38:19.198 --> 38:21.933
- He fights a monkey with a hatchet.
- A Chinaman.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.536
You fight a monkey
with a Chinaman?

38:24.570 --> 38:27.606
- (laughter)
- You need to start drinking.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.808
- I'll get you started, sir.
- What?

38:29.842 --> 38:32.110
- I said I'll get you started.
- What did you call me?

38:32.145 --> 38:35.381
Uh, sir?

38:37.685 --> 38:39.185
(music stops)

38:39.220 --> 38:43.089
Gilbert, why don't you take
that pig-in-shit smirk

38:43.124 --> 38:46.192
and that bedsheet and get
the fuck out of here?

38:46.226 --> 38:49.262
Take her with you.

38:49.296 --> 38:52.064
Why don't you watch
your language?

38:52.099 --> 38:54.433
Or what?

38:54.468 --> 38:59.171
Or you'll wish you had... sir.

39:01.808 --> 39:03.209
(Billie gasps) Gus!

39:03.243 --> 39:06.312
- Little fucking interloper.
- Gus, you need to calm down.

39:06.346 --> 39:08.380
He's...

39:08.415 --> 39:09.815
Jesus.

39:09.850 --> 39:14.019
He's not worth it, Gus.
Gus, stop it!

39:14.054 --> 39:17.389
Gus, Gus, stop it! Stop it!

39:19.292 --> 39:21.693
Gus! Stop...

39:22.796 --> 39:24.863
(Viola screams)

39:24.897 --> 39:26.564
(screaming) Gus! Stop!

39:26.598 --> 39:28.966
Stop it! Gus!

39:29.001 --> 39:31.536
Get... get back!

39:31.570 --> 39:33.170
I am not kidding!

39:35.407 --> 39:36.541
Oh!

39:36.575 --> 39:39.610
Billie: Vi, give me a hand.
Come on.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.412
(whimpering) I-Is
my nose broken?

39:41.446 --> 39:42.814
It's hard to tell.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.183
You have to leave. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.886
You're gonna get
sued by the studio!

39:47.921 --> 39:50.523
- How do you like that?
- He will pay for everything.

39:50.557 --> 39:51.858
Won't you?

39:51.892 --> 39:53.960
Okay, Vi, Vi, could you...
could you just...

39:53.994 --> 39:56.434
- could you just please...
- No, I'm not gonna leave you here.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.831
I will be fine, all right?

39:57.866 --> 39:59.967
Just... just get him
some ice, all right?

40:00.001 --> 40:02.169
- Okay?
- You have money for a taxi, right?

40:02.203 --> 40:03.604
Jesus.

40:10.078 --> 40:11.545
What's it about?

40:11.579 --> 40:13.480
What?

40:13.547 --> 40:15.682
The picture.

40:16.584 --> 40:19.986
A gangster

40:20.020 --> 40:21.955
and a showgirl.

40:26.326 --> 40:28.227
I don't like this arrangement.

40:28.261 --> 40:31.163
I don't like looking
the other way.

40:31.198 --> 40:34.901
I don't like not asking questions I'm
not supposed to hear the answers to...

40:34.936 --> 40:36.836
what you're up to,
who's here, who's not.

40:36.871 --> 40:39.472
- I don't like you lying to me.
- I never lied about...

40:39.506 --> 40:42.141
Not telling... it's the
same goddamn thing.

40:42.176 --> 40:45.177
- I don't like it!
- I don't ask you either.

40:45.212 --> 40:48.548
I'd say that's mighty white
of me, wouldn't you?

40:51.618 --> 40:53.285
I can take care of you.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.788
You won't have to
worry about anything.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.323
I'm not worried, Gus.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.262
How long do you think
this is going to last?

41:06.765 --> 41:08.299
Don't you think I'm any good?

41:08.333 --> 41:10.534
The business you're in.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.402
You don't, do you?

41:12.436 --> 41:14.637
There's nothing
you can count on.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.572
Look at your friend. You
wanna wind up like her?

41:16.607 --> 41:19.742
- Leave Vi out of it.
- It happens all the time.

41:19.776 --> 41:23.145
People just want something new.

41:23.179 --> 41:25.080
In a year from now, two years...

41:25.115 --> 41:28.684
I have a father, okay?
He's in Newburgh.

41:28.718 --> 41:31.153
He thinks a fist is a good
way to end an argument

41:31.187 --> 41:32.855
and I don't live there anymore.

41:32.889 --> 41:36.459
- That's how you see me?
- That's how you sound.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.370
I'm on my own, Gus.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.674
I have been for years.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.945
I like it.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.549
(sighs)

42:00.851 --> 42:03.052
And...

42:03.087 --> 42:06.289
Go on, say it.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.726
You're no fun this way.

42:17.269 --> 42:19.504
And what do you want from me?

42:21.440 --> 42:25.443
I just want you...

42:26.478 --> 42:29.914
to be my gangster.

43:08.053 --> 43:09.853
- Husband.
- Ah! Dear.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.422
I, uh... excuse me.

43:11.457 --> 43:12.125
What are you doing?

43:12.159 --> 43:14.636
We need to leave here
as soon as possible.

43:14.660 --> 43:17.762
- Why?
- I can carry Abigail and two cases.

43:17.796 --> 43:18.464
Husband...

43:18.498 --> 43:20.275
All you will need to do
is bundle up Chester.

43:20.299 --> 43:23.034
Husband, what has happened?

43:23.102 --> 43:28.007
I... at work, an incident.

43:28.041 --> 43:30.075
He... a bad person.

43:30.110 --> 43:32.712
And the other event.

43:32.746 --> 43:34.280
Where... where would
you like to go?

43:34.314 --> 43:38.485
I'm open to any state except
New Jersey and New York

43:38.519 --> 43:40.220
and Illinois, obviously.

43:40.255 --> 43:41.187
But aside from those,
we can discuss it...

43:41.211 --> 43:42.166
Shh!

43:42.190 --> 43:44.124
You stop!

43:44.158 --> 43:45.725
Wait.

43:45.759 --> 43:48.160
(cork pops, pouring liquid)

43:50.563 --> 43:52.798
- Drink this.
- I...

43:52.832 --> 43:55.701
Go on. Do.

43:56.703 --> 43:58.436
(gags)

43:58.504 --> 43:59.871
What's this?

43:59.905 --> 44:03.708
The whiskey for Mr. O'Banion.

44:03.743 --> 44:07.078
I make it all day while
you don't come home.

44:07.146 --> 44:08.814
14 bottles.

44:08.848 --> 44:11.216
You did this by yourself?

44:11.250 --> 44:14.018
- Also three for us.
- Us?

44:14.053 --> 44:16.353
Aquavit.

44:16.388 --> 44:20.490
When I was girl,
I make for Papa.

44:20.525 --> 44:23.894
Some orange peel,
too, for flavor.

44:23.928 --> 44:25.863
No. No, no, no.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.364
We're not supposed
to drink any...

44:27.398 --> 44:30.867
Not to drink, to sell.

44:30.935 --> 44:33.002
- Sell where?
- On Kedzie Boulevard.

44:33.037 --> 44:35.171
To Norwegian people there.

44:35.482 --> 44:37.082
What?

44:37.111 --> 44:38.844
Syttende Mai is tomorrow,

44:38.879 --> 44:42.648
the day to celebrate when Norway
become free of the Danes.

44:42.682 --> 44:45.852
We sell the aquavit for the
extra money it will bring.

44:45.886 --> 44:51.257
It's not what Mr. O'Banion
needs for, so no problems.

44:54.128 --> 44:55.762
Darling, I...

44:55.797 --> 44:57.931
We do this so you
don't worry yourself

44:57.966 --> 45:00.534
about losing your job.

45:00.568 --> 45:03.804
We make more, we sell more.

45:03.839 --> 45:06.674
We stay.

45:06.709 --> 45:10.112
There is no need for us
to be going anywhere.

45:10.146 --> 45:12.481
We buy a house right here...

45:12.549 --> 45:15.018
- Hmm.
- In Cicero.

45:18.823 --> 45:21.091
When did you get in?

45:22.326 --> 45:24.494
- (lighter clicks)
- Last night.

45:24.528 --> 45:26.830
Late.

45:26.864 --> 45:29.065
I need this room.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.134
The roofers have to
inspect the ceiling.

45:31.168 --> 45:32.969
I told you I ain't
paying for that.

45:33.003 --> 45:34.704
I took a loan, Charles.

45:34.738 --> 45:36.238
You needn't concern yourself.

45:36.273 --> 45:38.741
Why are you here, anyway?

45:38.775 --> 45:41.877
I got business with A.R.

45:42.846 --> 45:45.114
And Nucky Thompson.

45:46.150 --> 45:47.750
What of it?

45:49.186 --> 45:52.055
- When are you meeting?
- Tonight.

45:52.089 --> 45:54.591
We got a dinner at Babette's.

45:54.625 --> 45:58.361
You belittle my business,

45:58.396 --> 46:00.263
break bread with my enemies.

46:00.297 --> 46:02.132
Who the fuck you think you are?

46:02.166 --> 46:04.968
Come on, I'll give you a nice,
hard fuck like you like.

46:05.002 --> 46:08.304
- I want you out.
- (sighs)

46:08.372 --> 46:11.607
- I need a shower first.
- Out of the business.

46:13.577 --> 46:16.346
Here's a check.

46:16.380 --> 46:18.181
$4,500.

46:18.215 --> 46:20.683
The fuck I'm gonna
do with a check?

46:21.819 --> 46:25.088
Stick it up your ass
for all I care.

46:25.122 --> 46:27.523
Better yet, let Nucky
do it for you.

46:27.558 --> 46:29.592
Whoa, what the fuck you doing?

46:33.931 --> 46:36.966
- Dr. Mason.
- Hello.

46:37.001 --> 46:38.568
Did you drive here?

46:38.636 --> 46:43.306
No, I was... I was
waiting for you.

46:45.910 --> 46:47.777
I need your help with something

46:47.812 --> 46:50.313
and it's rather delicate.

46:50.347 --> 46:52.715
Too delicate to discuss inside?

46:55.719 --> 46:58.120
I would like to ask you

46:58.155 --> 47:02.491
to help me...
obtain a diaphragm.

47:04.127 --> 47:07.162
Is this what the Shearer woman
wanted to speak to you about?

47:07.196 --> 47:08.830
Yes.

47:10.899 --> 47:14.335
Actually, I suppose
I'd need two.

47:14.369 --> 47:16.237
Two?

47:16.304 --> 47:19.206
One for her...

47:19.241 --> 47:21.208
and one for me.

47:26.080 --> 47:30.851
It was nearly midnight
when I felt the pain.

47:31.987 --> 47:34.788
The midwife was called,

47:34.823 --> 47:37.624
and together we
passed the night.

47:40.261 --> 47:43.764
Hours later, after my ordeal,

47:43.799 --> 47:46.434
she placed him at my breast.

47:46.469 --> 47:49.471
It was just after dawn.

47:49.505 --> 47:53.275
The whole world
looked brand-new.

47:59.282 --> 48:02.050
Do you have children, Mr.
Rosetti?

48:02.085 --> 48:06.121
Two girls. My little princesses.

48:06.155 --> 48:08.690
Beauties just like their mother.

48:08.725 --> 48:10.759
They're the lights of your life.

48:10.793 --> 48:13.195
The sun rises and sets.

48:13.230 --> 48:16.433
One day they're
little, the next...

48:22.641 --> 48:26.177
My grandson...

48:26.245 --> 48:27.979
he's all I have left.

48:28.013 --> 48:29.581
(footsteps approach)

48:29.615 --> 48:32.050
Ahem.

48:32.118 --> 48:33.485
Mr. Harrow,

48:33.519 --> 48:35.987
have you met Mr. Rosetti?

48:36.022 --> 48:38.690
I have not.

48:38.724 --> 48:40.692
A pleasure.

48:42.061 --> 48:45.230
- Tonino.
- How do you do?

48:46.165 --> 48:48.700
I've restocked the bar.

48:48.735 --> 48:52.905
- And Tommy is asleep?
- Yes.

48:52.939 --> 48:54.674
That will be all.

49:01.115 --> 49:02.782
You use him to scare
away the mice?

49:02.850 --> 49:04.384
(laughs)

49:04.418 --> 49:06.552
Mr. Harrow was a
friend of my son.

49:06.586 --> 49:10.990
Are you familiar with Babette's?

49:11.024 --> 49:12.958
Supper club on the boardwalk.

49:12.993 --> 49:15.428
I ate there with Nucky
before our falling-out.

49:15.462 --> 49:16.929
Have you fallen out?

49:16.963 --> 49:19.365
I hadn't realized.

49:21.568 --> 49:23.436
He'll be dining
there this evening

49:23.470 --> 49:25.705
with Mr. Rothstein.

49:25.739 --> 49:27.140
You don't say.

49:27.174 --> 49:29.409
I'm not sure what time,

49:29.443 --> 49:32.446
but that shouldn't be
hard to ascertain.

49:35.049 --> 49:37.551
Why are you telling me this?

49:39.587 --> 49:42.389
I thought perhaps you'd
like to surprise him.

49:48.129 --> 49:50.163
(knocks)

49:50.198 --> 49:52.799
You have a phone call.

49:55.436 --> 49:57.003
Am I supposed to guess?

49:57.038 --> 49:59.172
The gentleman would
not reveal himself,

49:59.206 --> 50:03.176
but he said you would be
relieved to hear his voice.

50:09.516 --> 50:11.985
- Who is this?
- Mr. Thompson.

50:12.019 --> 50:13.686
That's who you called, isn't it?

50:13.721 --> 50:16.355
This is Andrew Mellon.

50:16.389 --> 50:18.857
Sir, what can I do for you?

50:18.892 --> 50:22.361
A few days from now, Treasury
agents in Cincinnati

50:22.395 --> 50:24.497
will arrest George Remus

50:24.531 --> 50:27.433
for multiple violations
of the Volstead Act,

50:27.468 --> 50:30.337
including the purchase of
government liquor permits

50:30.371 --> 50:31.474
from a close associate

50:31.507 --> 50:33.884
of the Attorney General
of the United States.

50:33.908 --> 50:36.677
- Are you referring to Jess Smith?
- In exchange,

50:36.712 --> 50:38.813
I expect the Overholt Distillery

50:38.848 --> 50:41.883
to be operational
within one month

50:41.917 --> 50:44.986
and generating a profit
the month thereafter.

50:45.020 --> 50:47.521
I assure you that
will be the case.

50:47.556 --> 50:49.924
Henceforth, you will
not contact me.

50:49.959 --> 50:52.427
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

50:52.461 --> 50:56.464
Then our intercourse
is concluded.

51:03.675 --> 51:05.147
(music playing)

51:05.180 --> 51:10.957
♪ Every cloud must have
a silver lining... ♪

51:10.981 --> 51:14.417
♪ Wait until the sun
shines through... ♪

51:14.451 --> 51:17.988
- Am I allowed in?
- I lost an earring.

51:18.023 --> 51:20.057
Which?

51:21.259 --> 51:24.295
These hummingbirds you gave me.

51:24.329 --> 51:26.631
I'll buy you new ones.

51:26.665 --> 51:28.966
I like these.

51:30.102 --> 51:31.969
And who are you supposed to be?

51:32.004 --> 51:34.138
- Huh?
- Stand up.

51:34.173 --> 51:36.741
Oh.

51:39.745 --> 51:41.546
Like it?

51:41.580 --> 51:43.681
I don't know.

51:43.715 --> 51:45.683
Yes.

51:45.717 --> 51:48.686
For the picture?

51:48.721 --> 51:52.156
Just felt like being someone
else for a little bit.

51:52.190 --> 51:54.725
Who?

51:54.760 --> 51:57.395
Nadine Beckenbauer.

51:58.331 --> 52:00.866
Where you from, Nadine?

52:00.900 --> 52:02.534
Newburgh, New York.

52:02.569 --> 52:04.670
No kidding?

52:04.704 --> 52:07.005
God's honest.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.841
Ever been to Atlantic
City before?

52:08.909 --> 52:12.077
First time.

52:12.111 --> 52:14.546
And what do you think?

52:14.580 --> 52:17.015
(German accent) They
told me it was wicked.

52:17.050 --> 52:19.651
They were right.

52:22.955 --> 52:25.390
(normal accent) Am
I under arrest?

52:25.424 --> 52:28.292
You're being freed.

52:28.326 --> 52:31.195
It's a single premium annuity.

52:31.229 --> 52:33.163
Again, please, in English.

52:33.198 --> 52:35.766
Guaranteed income the
first of each month

52:35.800 --> 52:38.335
for the rest of your life.

52:38.370 --> 52:41.738
We already made up, Gus, okay?

52:41.772 --> 52:43.440
That's not what it's about.

52:43.474 --> 52:45.642
Then what's the gag?

52:45.676 --> 52:47.310
Call it a mystery.

52:49.714 --> 52:51.982
- I don't need...
- Need anyone's help.

52:52.016 --> 52:53.683
I envy that.

52:55.887 --> 53:00.056
So what you do with this money
and who you do it with...

53:00.124 --> 53:03.560
it's nobody's business
but your own.

53:03.594 --> 53:05.962
Are you saying goodbye?

53:05.996 --> 53:07.864
I'm saying, "Hello..."

53:07.899 --> 53:10.233
Nadine Beckenbauer.

53:10.268 --> 53:12.769
"Hello and good luck."

be melancholy too. ♪

53:29.019 --> 53:31.921
You know, if you change your
name, you might go pretty far.

53:36.126 --> 53:39.195
I will put on a different pair.

53:47.371 --> 53:50.473
(choir singing in Norwegian)

54:07.692 --> 54:11.328
Unlike steam irons,
aquavit sells itself.

54:11.363 --> 54:14.332
(crowd cheering)

54:16.568 --> 54:20.638
(singing in Norwegian)

54:20.673 --> 54:23.941

54:32.718 --> 54:35.486

Nell's if you're interested.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.021
I'm heading home.

54:37.055 --> 54:39.823
Osso buco tonight.

54:39.858 --> 54:41.859
Greektown.

54:41.893 --> 54:44.662
Demos was short. I
got someone on it.

54:44.696 --> 54:46.397
He's good for it.

54:53.872 --> 54:55.439
Need anything else?

54:55.474 --> 54:59.477
Sounds like you got
it all under control.

55:02.281 --> 55:03.681
See you tomorrow, then.

55:03.716 --> 55:06.017

And this gentleman...

55:29.540 --> 55:31.374
he's trustworthy?

55:31.408 --> 55:34.944
He's a Chink. I ain't inviting
him over for Christmas dinner.

55:34.978 --> 55:37.680
$50,000 apiece is
a lot of money.

55:37.714 --> 55:40.015
Sell it on the street,
make 10 times that.

55:40.050 --> 55:42.151
If you wanna make extra, sure.

55:42.185 --> 55:44.120

- Gangbusters, I tell ya.

55:52.628 --> 55:55.196
I'm selling radios now.

55:55.231 --> 55:57.331
Oh, aren't you going
to introduce me?

55:58.600 --> 56:00.034

your mind so soon.

56:10.179 --> 56:12.614
(guffawing)

56:12.648 --> 56:14.283
Go ahead.

56:14.317 --> 56:16.218
No reason for both
of us to suffer.

56:16.252 --> 56:18.420
Don't malinger, now.

56:21.724 --> 56:23.792
So you're out of the
cutlery business now?

56:23.826 --> 56:25.961
Well, there's a lot more silver

56:25.995 --> 56:28.130
in the Radio Corporation
of America.

56:28.164 --> 56:30.232
How about RCA,

56:30.267 --> 56:33.803
the official radio of
the world's playground?

56:33.838 --> 56:36.406
Strictly on the QT, I
know a charming lass

56:36.440 --> 56:39.476
who's very close to Mr.
David Sarnoff himself.

56:39.511 --> 56:43.948
And I bet... I am certain...
(fades)

56:43.982 --> 56:45.449
Barker: Here we go.

56:45.484 --> 56:48.919
It's a game of chance.
It's a game of skill.

57:10.909 --> 57:14.178
