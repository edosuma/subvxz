Previously on Andi Mack...

00:06.120 --> 00:07.620
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

00:07.620 --> 00:08.790
That was terrible.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.210
-It'll get better.
-No, it won't.

00:11.210 --> 00:14.120
Can I ask you something?
You seem to know Bowie.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.080
It's just 'cause I was thinking
I'd like to ask him out.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.540
Saw you at The Spoon
with some person
I didn't know

00:20.540 --> 00:23.500

who that person is with Jonah."

00:23.500 --> 00:24.880
She's just a friend.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.120
-I made a friend today.
-Everybody's making friends.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.750
I'm looking for Jonah Beck.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.290

I don't know...

03:04.920 --> 03:06.710

turkey legs.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.710

I bring you to
an all-you-can-eat
pancake breakfast

03:27.960 --> 03:29.330
and all you can eat is one?

03:29.330 --> 03:30.750
And a half.

03:30.750 --> 03:34.120
Well, get comfortable
because all I can eat is a lot.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.420
Oh, hold on.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.960
Ooh! Is that your license?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.040
Wait.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.540
I just want to look
at your picture.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.380
Look at you, you're adorable.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.580
How old were you?

03:53.040 --> 03:55.540
-Bowie!
-What?

03:55.540 --> 03:57.750
Today is your birthday.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.960
It is?

03:58.960 --> 04:01.580
Why didn't you say anything?

04:01.580 --> 04:03.750
(sighs) Look, it's no big deal.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.920
I just don't like announcing,
"Hey, it's my day.
Celebrate me.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.670
Buy me presents.
Sing to me."

04:10.670 --> 04:12.120
(scoffs) Why not?

04:12.120 --> 04:15.170
It's the one day a year
where you get to be
extra special.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.830
Well, I don't need that.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.250
What are you
doing today?

04:18.250 --> 04:20.330
All-you-can-eat pancakes
with my daughter.

04:20.330 --> 04:21.540
Besides this?

04:21.540 --> 04:23.620
I have a shift later
at Judy's Blooms.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.710
(scoffs) Ooh! I have an idea!

04:26.710 --> 04:28.500
You should come
to RenFaire with me.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.540
You can be king for a day.

04:30.540 --> 04:34.080
(chuckles) Because I don't
need to be king for a day
at RenFaire.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.830
Watch this.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.670
(deep, loud voice):
More pancakes!

04:41.750 --> 04:43.750
(regular voice):
And a little bit
more coffee, please?

04:47.670 --> 04:49.880
Today's his birthday?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.880
Did I know that?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.290
I don't think I knew that.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.620
Because he refuses
to celebrate it.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.710
He doesn't feel the need
to celebrate it.

04:57.710 --> 05:01.080
(sighs)
Sometimes he can be so Bowie.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.580
But... we're gonna
celebrate it!

05:04.580 --> 05:07.290
We're throwing him
a surprise party!

05:07.290 --> 05:08.880
Great idea.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.380
Do you want to
have it here?

05:10.380 --> 05:12.540
We should do it
at Cece and Pops'.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.620
It'll be a surprise
for them too.

05:14.620 --> 05:20.620
Okay, so we need cake,
we need streamers, we need...

05:20.620 --> 05:23.960
somebody to do all of this
because I'm going to RenFaire.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.920
No, no. It's okay.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.290
I'll just skip it this year.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.790
No, go!

05:30.790 --> 05:32.040
I can handle this.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.750
Okay, but this
has to be next level.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.710
Um, excuse me,

05:37.710 --> 05:43.710
which one of us
threw a party that was
off the chain?

05:43.710 --> 05:47.620
Okay, so the fact
that you just said
"off the chain,"

05:47.620 --> 05:49.330
worries me.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.790
How about off the hook?

05:51.790 --> 05:53.620
Off the charts?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.170
It's gotta be
off something, right?

05:56.170 --> 05:58.210
Okay, so let's just agree

05:58.210 --> 06:01.290
that you're good
at planning parties,

06:01.290 --> 06:04.250
but not so good
at describing them?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.120
So, I'm throwing him

06:11.120 --> 06:13.540
a surprise party tonight
and you both have to be there.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.620
We will be.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.580
I'm a big fan
of the birthday blindside.

06:16.580 --> 06:17.830
For future reference,

06:17.830 --> 06:19.500
you two might want
to remember that about me.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.380
We know that about you.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.380
But it's impossible
to surprise someone

06:23.380 --> 06:25.710
who's constantly asking
to be surprised.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.710
I'm gonna cut out
a little early from the Faire

06:27.710 --> 06:28.790
so I can help set up.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.710
You guys can both
be there by 7:00.

06:30.710 --> 06:31.920
Be where?

06:31.920 --> 06:33.670
Oh, hey!
Cece and Pops' house.

06:33.670 --> 06:36.120
I'm throwing Bowie a surprise
birthday party tonight.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.210
Doshe!

06:37.210 --> 06:39.670
Oh, come here.
I need a picture with you.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.120
-What for?
-(camera clicks)

06:42.120 --> 06:45.580

06:53.290 --> 06:54.830
So, when is your mom
coming home?

06:54.830 --> 06:56.380
I have no idea.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.500
Let's go back
to talking about
Bowie's birthday.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.920
Forsooth! I enlighten thee
with yon truth.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.420
Birthdays were not celebrated
duringst medieval times.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.210
Nor did most commoners

07:09.210 --> 07:12.790
have a sense of day
or annum of their birth.

07:12.790 --> 07:15.960
We should get him in there
before his head explodes.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.830
Yeah, all right,
come on. (chuckles)

11:25.620 --> 11:28.960
It's your birthday? What?

11:30.670 --> 11:32.750
Okay, yes,
it's about your birthday.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.500
Bex, look.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.710
As long as it's not
a surprise party. Okay?

11:43.460 --> 11:46.250
(chuckles)
It's a surprise party,
isn't it?

11:46.250 --> 11:48.080
Surprise!

11:53.210 --> 11:54.580
Surprise!

11:54.580 --> 11:57.170
Okay, I appreciate the thought.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.040
It was Andi's thought.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.080
She wanted to do
something nice for you.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.710
Look, I-- I can't go.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.120
I'm sorry, I-- I just can't.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.580
Bowie, can you tell me
what's really going on?

12:10.580 --> 12:13.540
Because I don't buy
that this is all because

12:13.540 --> 12:16.040
you hate the idea
of birthdays.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.210
I don't hate the idea of them.

12:18.210 --> 12:20.500
I just hate
the idea of mine.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.250
Was it always like that?

12:22.250 --> 12:23.960
No.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.040
(sighs)

12:32.710 --> 12:35.170
My dad and I
share the same birthday.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.080
We'd always spend it together.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.210
We'd go out
on a boat and fish.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.790
Neither of us
would catch anything.

12:42.790 --> 12:46.210
So we'd end up
eating store-bought seafood.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.830
And talking about

12:47.830 --> 12:49.380
how the next year,

12:49.380 --> 12:51.880
the fish would definitely bite.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.540
Sounds really nice.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.210
Yeah, it was great.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.920
Anyway, he passed away
three years ago.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.620
Oh, no.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.620
Bowie, I'm so sorry.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.620
And ever since then,
I just haven't felt
like celebrating.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.420
Not on our special day,
at least.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.290
It just... hasn't felt right.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.380
Look, I--
I totally understand.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.960
I really do.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.080
And you should be able
to spend today
however you want.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.210
I will say

13:32.210 --> 13:35.120
you may not have your dad,

13:35.120 --> 13:36.960
but you do have a daughter

13:36.960 --> 13:40.080
who wants to make
special memories
with her dad.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.290
And right now, she's waiting
for you to show up

13:44.290 --> 13:49.120
at a party that she planned
because she loves her father

13:49.120 --> 13:51.000
as much as you loved yours.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.920
That doesn't feel
so bad, does it?

13:59.330 --> 14:01.210
No, it doesn't.

14:01.210 --> 14:02.420
(chuckles)

14:02.420 --> 14:06.250
You're right.
Of course you're right.

14:06.250 --> 14:11.290
Hey, a broken clock
is still a great paper weight.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.380
Or however that goes.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.710
Thanks.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.330
So, should we
get going?

14:20.330 --> 14:22.920
Ah, mm. No.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.710
We still have
a bunch of time to kill.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.500
I thought it would
take longer to convince you.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.250
M'lady, I must beg thou
forbearance with
my lowly self.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.210
'Twas naught. 'Twas naught.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.880
Forsooth, I--

14:38.880 --> 14:41.830
Iris, I-- I can't do this

14:41.830 --> 14:43.420
when I have something
I really need to say.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.250
Okay.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.670
I've never met,
and I never thought
that I would meet,

14:47.670 --> 14:49.250
someone so much like myself.

14:49.250 --> 14:54.120
And if I did meet them,
I never thought
that I'd like them.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.460
But--

14:55.460 --> 14:58.830
You like me,
but you don't
like me like that.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.040
I'm sorry.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.290
Me too.

15:04.290 --> 15:08.460
I'm new at this, but I think
this is the part where I ask
if we could still be friends?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.540
And this is the part
where I say sure.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.330
Seems fated we should
cross paths anon.

15:18.330 --> 15:21.120
Perhaps, sayeth, PaleoCon?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.580
A fortnight past,
I acquired my billets.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.330
You got billets already?

15:25.330 --> 15:27.330
I didn't even think
they were for sale yet.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.000
'Twas a fortunate
happenstance--

15:29.000 --> 15:31.580
Whoa, whoa! Speak English!
I need those tickets.

15:34.710 --> 15:36.330
Closing time.
I need my boxes.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.790
Okay, Buffy, let's just
call it a draw.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.540
No way.
Driscoll doesn't draw.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.460
Fine. You win.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.960
No, you don't.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.670
-Pick up that rope.
-Pfft.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.500
Okay, I win.
Can we go home now?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.170
That wasn't fair.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.920
Pick an ending, any ending.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.830
You're not taking
this seriously.

15:57.830 --> 15:59.710
And it's serious.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.170
Is it?
Or is it just
a rope and two boxes?

16:03.290 --> 16:04.920
Why is winning
so important to you?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.330
It just is.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.620
But nobody was even watching.
What are you trying to prove?

16:09.620 --> 16:11.040
That I'm strong.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.460
I have to be strong.

16:15.460 --> 16:19.040
Because that's what
I promise my mom every time
she gets deployed.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.830
She always says,
"Be strong, Buffy."

16:24.540 --> 16:26.330
So I am.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You ready?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.460
Yeah, I think so.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.380
Okay, let's see
your surprise face.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.500
My what?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.750
Your surprise face.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.420
This party lives and dies

16:52.420 --> 16:53.750
on your ability to look

16:53.750 --> 16:55.670
genuinely surprised
when you walk
through that door.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.670
How hard can it be
to look surprised?

16:58.670 --> 17:00.420
Well, we're about to find out.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.250
(gasps)

17:08.710 --> 17:11.330
Well, does that
look surprised or what?

17:11.330 --> 17:14.420
Yeah, surprised to find
a dead body in your trunk.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.500
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm not an actor.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.750
No kidding.

17:17.750 --> 17:18.960
Then help me.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.670
Just... don't try so hard.

17:21.670 --> 17:24.380
Act like a normal
human being would

17:24.380 --> 17:27.380
if he walked into
a room filled with his
friends and family.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.380
Yeah, do that.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.540
Okay.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.000
(door opens)

17:45.580 --> 17:47.670
-All: Surprise!
-(noisemakers)

17:47.670 --> 17:51.580
What? Just what
I wanted! Clones!

17:52.580 --> 17:54.210
Nailed it.

17:54.210 --> 17:57.290
Are you kidding me, Bex?
A surprise party?

17:57.290 --> 17:58.420
Too much.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.000
Happy birthday!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.330
