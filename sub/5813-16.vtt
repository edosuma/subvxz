WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:06.632
Oh, good, you're home.
Listen, you gotta help me bury a body.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.095
His real name is Rufus Turner.
He's a hunter.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.976
- One of your old friends?
- Have you seen this man?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.023
- No.
- I ain't asking for no help.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.312
Never seen that dick.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.985
I'm not asking for your permission.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.482
- How do you know he's a dick?
- Lucky guess.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.778
Missed me?

00:20.938 --> 00:23.942
He always used to pull the old
"Can't work on the Sabbath" card

00:24.149 --> 00:25.651
whenever we had to bury a body.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.696
Taught me a thing or two
about what's really out there.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.493
Pretty soon, we were riding together.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.951
Worked like that for years.
Kind of like you two knuckleheads.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.376
Just like old times.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.667
Long as I get to drive.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.206
Hell, no!

00:53.637 --> 00:56.811
I'm not mad, honey. I'm just outnumbered.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.518
This place is way more
of a fixer-upper than we thought.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.735
Like, I'm starting to see
why it was on the market for so long.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.072
No, I know.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.159
You're right. You're right.
One room at a time.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.197
Starting with this awful wallpaper.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.040
Thank you.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.707
Yeah, love you, too. Love you too, Maya.
Okay. Bye.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.924
Kat?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.729
- Kat?
- Mommy...

01:37.889 --> 01:39.857
Something bad is in the house.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.298
It was just a nightmare, honey.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.361
But I heard footsteps.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.856
Why did we have to move here?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.114
And why is it so cold in my room?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.861
Yeah, it is cold in here, huh?

01:51.862 --> 01:56.038
But the furnace is going
to be fixed tomorrow.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.376
So, just gotta be patient, okay?

01:58.744 --> 02:00.371
We all do.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.296
Can I get you anything?

02:02.581 --> 02:04.299
- I'm thirsty.
- Okay.

02:04.583 --> 02:08.929
One glass of water, coming right up.
But then, back to sleep. Okay?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.597
Okay.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.584
Momma?

03:04.643 --> 03:08.523
All right, nothing on Amara.
Nothing on Cass.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.990
Keep your head up.
We're gonna win this. Remember?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.030
Yeah, that was before two weeks of squat.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.282
Yeah. Well, look,
nobody said it was gonna be easy.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.290
You know the drill. Meantime, we hunt.
Check this out.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.879
Naoki Himura.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.421
Said her little girl
was attacked by an entity.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.501
- Kid's in a coma.
- Yeah.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.962
Only sign of trauma
is what the mom is describing

03:32.170 --> 03:34.298
as a handprint from the alleged attacker.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.506
But no one else was in the house
at the time, so...

03:36.508 --> 03:38.556
So, vengeful spirit? Poltergeist?

03:38.802 --> 03:41.146
It's worth finding out.
It's only a couple hours away.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.744
You really think now's the time
to take our eye off the prize?

03:43.807 --> 03:47.186
Hey, we canâ€™t just sit around,
and wait for a lead.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.917
Plus, it'd be nice to get a win.
This case seems like a layup.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.989
Yeah, when was the last time
we had a layup?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.872
My wife is flying back,
but her flight's been delayed in London.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.251
So, I'm alone in all this.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.674
Well, we're here to help however we can.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.756
I appreciate that,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.596
but why would the FBI
have any interest in this?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.845
Just doing our due diligence.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.166
You know what, why don't you go ahead
and tell us about the night of the attack?

04:20.177 --> 04:21.928
Nobody believes there was an attack.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.352
Even the Internet thinks I'm crazy.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.728
Well, we don't.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.241
Okay. Well, Kat woke up screaming.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.535
I thought she was just having a nightmare.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.739
But she said she heard footsteps

04:40.947 --> 04:44.702
and that she felt something bad
in the house.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.545
- Did you also hear footsteps?
- No.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.966
Did you notice anything else?
Cold spots or flickering lights?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.126
Yeah, actually.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.428
The lights were out in her room,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.131
and it was cold in there.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.597
What does that mean?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.542
Would you mind if we went
and had a look at your house?

05:01.593 --> 05:04.096
Sure, yeah.
I mean, if you think it's gonna help.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.146
There's a hide-a-key
under a painted rock by the front door.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.482
- Great. Thank you for your help.
- Yeah. Sure.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.633
Excuse me, can I help you boys?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.426
Maybe.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.675
Special Agent Rizer.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.935
This is my partner,
Special Agent Bean. We...

05:44.094 --> 05:46.438
Why do the FBI keep coming back
to that house?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.519
Excuse me?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.109
A handful of years ago, the FBI came here.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.528
I'm the head of the Neighborhood Watch,
you know,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.818
so I asked the two agents
what they were doing here.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.148
And what'd they say?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.033
Not a thing.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.449
They were two of the rudest people
I'd ever met.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.779
Huh.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.662
By any chance, were these agents, um,

06:06.533 --> 06:07.830
elder statesmen?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.833
Yeah. Friends of yours?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.737
Why are you sleeping in your car, Bobby?
It's lunchtime.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.195
- What the hell am I doing here?
- You're helping me with a case.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.532
Like I told you on the phone. You okay?

06:49.159 --> 06:53.289
The Apocalypse is on the horizon
and you want to hunt a damn ghost?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.874
Well, unless you found a way
to stop the end of the world

06:56.082 --> 06:59.712
during your little siesta,
we got jack all on any of that business.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.590
You know, I knew you were in the area,

07:02.881 --> 07:06.602
heard about this possible little gig.
I thought a win would be nice.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.057
Oh, wait!

07:08.511 --> 07:11.515
- I'm supposed to be your friggin' backup?
- Yeah.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.645
Well, if by "backup," you mean you do
all the heavy lifting while I watch.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.022
It's Shabbat!

07:18.229 --> 07:20.231
- Are you serious?
- Deadly.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.989
You drove over here!
Ain't that against the rules?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.240
Uh-uh-uh.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.575
Less talking. More hunting.

07:28.239 --> 07:32.585
Excuse me,
what are you gentlemen here for?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.047
FBI, ma'am. Special Agent Riggs.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.421
My partner, Special Agent Murtaugh.
We're on official FBI business.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.885
Nothing to worry about.

07:41.086 --> 07:44.386
Well, lam in charge
of the Neighborhood Watch here, sir.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.310
I would like to know what this
official business is you're here about.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.104
It's officially
none of your damn business, ma'am.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.853
- Were you ever nice?
- 1985.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.605
Worst year of my life.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.009
Hm.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.180
I'm getting hits everywhere down here.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.963
Yeah, upstairs, as well.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.168
All right. So, what? Bobby and Rufus
worked a case here back in the day?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.677
I mean, we've had houses
with multiple ghosts before.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.925
I don't know, Dean.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.927
I mean, the world is small.
But it's not that small.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.849
I have got a couple of Bobby's
old journals in the trunk.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.170
Why don't we dig into those?

09:11.342 --> 09:13.720
Dig into the history of the house.
See what's what.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.725
It was our first night in the house.
We'd all gone to bed.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.444
And then Will, my son,
he called out for help.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.065
Said he heard a strange noise.
Sounded like footsteps.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.995
My husband and I ran to his room,

09:30.278 --> 09:34.875
but by the time we got there,
my baby was on the ground. Unconscious.

09:35.533 --> 09:40.039
Did you notice anything else that night?
Cold spots or lights flickering?

09:41.664 --> 09:44.463
Actually, yes! Both.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.296
Will's room was cold
and the lights were out.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.887
The doctors don't know
what's wrong with him.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.391
Apart from the strange mark on his ankle,
there's no sign of trauma.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.224
How do you mean "strange mark"?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.852
It looks like a handprint.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.691
Well, thank you very much.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.901
Uh, do you know of any affordable motels
in the area?

10:17.242 --> 10:20.746
Get this. The manager said two FBI agents
stayed here years ago.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.082
So I got the same room. For luck.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.923
Sorry to disturb reading time,
Your Holiness.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.884
Do not religiously persecute me, Bobby.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.473
Tell me something, huh?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.226
Why were you sleeping in your car earlier?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.720
Cops got nothing.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.764
Oh, you're really aren't going
to answer me, huh?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.059
Well, I got the realtor's report
on the house.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.696
'Cause they legally have to tell you
who died in a house before you buy it.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.944
Look at you, being all smart.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.487
So who died?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.366
There were two deaths at the house.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.573
The first was accidental. And don't laugh,

10:56.781 --> 11:00.581
a dude choked on a chicken bone.
And the other was a murder.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.920
Uh, a man shot his wife.

11:03.288 --> 11:07.418
Well, Bobby and Rufus
were definitely on a ghost hunt.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.471
Uh, "Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Possible ghost hunt with jackass."

11:18.303 --> 11:19.350
That's all he wrote?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.106
Yeah, I guess Bobby never got around
to finishing it. Slacker.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.604
Okay, so, they were either hunting
chicken bone or ass-hat.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.735
One ghost breaks bad back then,
the other's been marinating until now.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.555
- Um...
- The only problem I see

11:31.649 --> 11:32.696
is that we don't know

11:32.859 --> 11:36.909
what bones Bobby and Rufus burned,
so we might have to dig up two graves.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.353
I don't know, Dean.
I think there's more to it than that.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.243
I mean, somethings not right.
It's all a little too easy.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.126
Hey, easy like Sunday morning
works for me, okay?

11:45.330 --> 11:49.506
We could wrap this up quick.
Get back to hunting Amara. Get Cass back.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.470
I mean, hey, you said it yourself.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.764
This case is supposed to be
a layup, right?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.556
Yeah, but as much as I hate to admit it,
you were right.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.229
You know, I mean,
when have we ever had one of those?

12:01.429 --> 12:04.808
Come on! You think Bobby and Rufus wasted
any time arguing about this kind of crap?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.108
Let's go.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.609
Damn it, Rufus. Why do you have to make
everything so friggin' complicated?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.234
What's complicated?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.942
I'm just saying it's not a ghost.
It's a Baku.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.447
What?

12:15.735 --> 12:20.707
- A Japanese...
- I know what a Baku is, you dumbass.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.205
We hunted one together in Alaska.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.457
All right. I'll bet you
a bottle of Johnnie that it's a Baku.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.669
Well, get ready to buy me a bottle
of Johnnie, 'cause it ain't a Baku.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.719
It's a ghost. Plain and simple.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.801
And the sooner we get to burnin' bones,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.804
the sooner we can get back
to figuring out how to save the world.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.760
Now come on, we got diggin' to do.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.769
"We?" "We?"
How many times I got to tell you, man?

12:47.475 --> 12:49.728
Would it kill you to at least
wash this damn thing?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.064
Smells like roadkill casserole in here!

12:52.272 --> 12:54.149
Just shut up, you idjit!

12:57.402 --> 12:59.245
Son of a bitch!

13:00.238 --> 13:01.581
Ashes.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.085
There's gotta be an easier way
to dig graves.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.601
Why are you stopping?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.765
'Cause it's your turn.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.939
What? What, my turn? Hey, yo, yo, Bobby...

13:27.140 --> 13:28.312
Read my lips, Bobby.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.770
I cannot help you, all right?
It is Sabbath.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.948
It is after sundown. So get to digging.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.280
Good catch.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.627
Bobby, can I ask you something?

13:51.873 --> 13:55.548
Long as it's not about
why I was sleeping in my car earlier.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.387
Why were you sleeping in your car earlier?

14:04.469 --> 14:08.474
Been burnin' the midnight oil
last couple of weeks.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.187
Up for days.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.694
Looking for ways to stop the Apocalypse.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.156
Looking for anything.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.368
Sam and Dean,
they're right in the middle of this thing.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.830
I'm worried about my boys, Rufus.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.995
Your boys?

14:28.659 --> 14:32.209
Hey, hey. All right. Okay, Papa Bear.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.842
But you know more than anyone, Bobby.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.345
Even if we find a way
to keep the world spinning,

14:39.670 --> 14:41.923
not everyone's gonna be
on that bus ride home.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.852
Sacrifice, greater good...

14:47.428 --> 14:48.725
All that jazz.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.020
Yeah. I know.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.816
Oldest rule of hunting, Bobby.
You can't save everyone.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.545
- Oh, come on!
- Come on!

15:16.707 --> 15:18.380
Bobby always was thorough.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.554
Two ash cans.
Which means we're not hunting a ghost.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.716
- Told you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.224
You were right, for once.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.557
So then, what the hell are we hunting?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.586
Yeah.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.590
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Bye.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.097
- This has happened before.
- You first.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.926
Just... Come here. Dr. Richards.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.311
This is my partner, Special Agent Rizer.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.513
This is Dr. Richards.
Now, she's retired, but...

16:12.722 --> 16:14.395
I still have friends on staff here.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.320
So when I heard that two family members
had lapsed into unexplained comas,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.021
I came into see if I could help.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.991
So, you were here
when this happened before?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.358
Yes.

16:23.608 --> 16:27.078
Two FBI agents spoke to me
about that case, too.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.327
Mary Henderson went home
to get her son's favorite doll.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.661
When she didn't answer any calls,
her husband phoned the police.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.167
- They found her.
- And she's...

16:37.371 --> 16:40.671
Same as her son.
Weird mark on the ankle, that's it.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.462
So, it's some kind of coma?

16:44.295 --> 16:45.922
None like I've ever seen.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.723
How do you mean?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.934
Well, their vitals are fading rapidly.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.978
They don't show
some signs of rallying soon,

16:53.179 --> 16:54.726
I'm worried we may lose them.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.776
So, what happened?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.354
What happened? I have no idea.

17:01.646 --> 17:05.526
The next day, mother and son woke up.
Both perfectly fine.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.325
Obviously, I hope the same thing
happens here, with these two.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.491
Their vitals are failing as well. So...

17:13.074 --> 17:14.496
Okay, thank you for your time.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.459
- So, Bobby and Rufus' case... Huh.
- Yeah, it's back.

17:19.664 --> 17:23.885
- Whatever it was. ls. What did you find?
- I talked with the local PD.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.724
The actual cops that found Mary Henderson

17:25.877 --> 17:27.798
back in the day
and brought her to this hospital.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.474
Are the Hendersons still around?

17:31.676 --> 17:32.723
Sick!

17:33.219 --> 17:34.266
Come on!

17:36.639 --> 17:37.856
Mary Henderson?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.943
- Hi, we're Special Agents...
- Oh, God.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.652
Is it happening again?
Am I... Is my son in danger?

17:45.856 --> 17:48.029
No, no. Everything's fine.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.247
Um, but we would like to talk to you
about what happened with your son.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.503
Next thing you know,
I woke up in the hospital

17:59.704 --> 18:01.957
and one of the FBI agents told me

18:02.164 --> 18:05.134
to never touch the wallpaper
in the sitting room.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.253
Two people are in great danger.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.307
Anything you can remember.
Any little detail.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.180
I, um...

18:14.510 --> 18:17.229
When I was in the coma, I had a dream.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.932
I mean, it was more like a nightmare.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.983
It was like I was in the house,
but it wasn't the house.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.107
Everything was dark.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.989
It looked faded.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.410
And at first, I was alone,
but then I started to see things.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.416
What did you see, exactly?

18:38.242 --> 18:40.620
My husband. He was dead.

18:42.079 --> 18:46.425
I closed my eyes,
and when I opened them, he was gone.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.379
I tried to leave the house but I couldn't.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.136
And then,
that's when I started to see them.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.391
Spirits or something. I don't know.
Like I said, it's all faded now.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.268
It was just a bad dream.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.109
And what happened when you woke up?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.522
Well, we tried to move on, you know.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.199
But I couldn't shake the bad feeling.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.529
So, we put the house up for sale,
then the market crashed.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.911
So, finally,
we just walked on the mortgage.

19:18.115 --> 19:21.415
Which is why we now rent
and probably will forever.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.298
Destroying our credit
was worth it, though.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.009
Anything to get away from that damn house.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.023
Dean!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.442
Check this out.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.737
Look at this.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.457
You recognize that?

20:05.663 --> 20:09.133
Vaguely. Looks like they broke the seal
when they were redecorating.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.594
What the hell are we hunting?

20:48.456 --> 20:50.333
I got it. I think.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.265
A soul eater? What the hell is that?

20:58.966 --> 21:02.561
Undead creature that feeds on souls.
Hence the name.

21:03.637 --> 21:08.143
They exist in a place
between our world and another.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.270
Soul eater moves into a house,
and once it does,

21:11.479 --> 21:14.278
it makes
what the lore refers to as a "nest."

21:14.565 --> 21:17.785
"A place that exists outside
of time and space."

21:18.110 --> 21:21.740
The nest looks and feels like
whatever house the soul eater is in.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.870
So, Mary didn't have a nightmare
when she was in her coma.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.451
Remember she said
that she was in her house,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.536
but it wasn't her house?
She was in the nest.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.793
The soul eaters
aren't really here or there.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.046
But apparently, they can muster
enough strength to yank their vics' souls

21:33.250 --> 21:35.344
out of this world, and into their nest.

21:35.544 --> 21:39.515
And then as soon as the vic's in the nest,
they're outside of our space and time.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.719
Okay. Well, what about Mary, uh,
seeing her dead husband and her son?

21:42.927 --> 21:46.147
Apparently, the nest messes
with their victim's head.

21:46.347 --> 21:49.100
Shows them things they love,
parts of their soul, in distress.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.356
It keeps the victim's soul vulnerable.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.354
So what happens to the meat-suits
in the real world?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.735
They wither
and die in the real world.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.069
Which explains Mary
and her son's failing vitals.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.823
And the soul eater

22:01.737 --> 22:04.286
closes up the nest
and moves on to the next house.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.959
What happens to the remains
of the souls in the nest?

22:08.118 --> 22:11.372
Well, they wither, too.
But they stay with the soul eater,

22:11.580 --> 22:15.426
keeping it fed in lean times.
Sort of like a cud.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.090
Ew.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.922
Well, that sounds perfectly awful.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.600
We gotta kill this bastard before
the Hendersons' bodies wither and die.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.179
According to the lore,
they can't be killed.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.062
But I'm pretty sure they can be trapped.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.937
I think I've faced
one of these soul eaters before.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.445
Are you serious?

22:35.646 --> 22:37.319
There was a case down
in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.946
Bobby got a call from another hunter,
a guy named Harvey.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.996
Uh, he was hunting a case, house was
rumored to be chock full of poltergeists.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.496
But he couldn't find the bones to burn.
So, he calls Bobby for backup.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.168
Bobby hightails it down there.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.712
He goes into the house, buckshots,
guns blazing...

22:51.996 --> 22:53.714
No, no, no, no, no.

22:54.415 --> 22:58.136
Do not tell me how you tell it.
Tell me how it really happened.

22:59.587 --> 23:03.182
I stepped one foot inside that house
and filled my drawers.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.886
You could feel the badness, Rufus.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.980
I found Harv on the floor. In a coma.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.985
I tried to help, but it looked
like he'd been there for days.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.520
And then, I heard footsteps.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.815
I was trapped.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.994
But I had this old Celtic sigil.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.575
Sort of a "break glass in case
of emergency" sort of thing.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.701
Supposed to trap monsters

23:30.951 --> 23:33.071
but, to be honest,
the damn thing never worked before.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.965
But it was all I had.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.385
So I started, and this house's bad juju,

23:39.585 --> 23:41.804
it just got a hell of a lot worse.

23:42.296 --> 23:46.642
Then I finished the sigil, and once I did,
the house went back to normal.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.641
And, urn, Harv?

23:51.889 --> 23:53.732
He never did wake up.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.229
Yeah, well.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.153
Oldest rule, Bobby.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.577
Oldest rule.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.000
So, uh, you actually trapped a soul eater?

24:15.496 --> 24:20.093
Bobby and Rufus put up their sigil
and trapped the soul eater in its nest.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.544
Right, yeah.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.880
And it stayed there until Naoki

24:24.088 --> 24:26.762
accidentally broke the sigil's seal
when she redecorated.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.385
Right. Which set the soul eater free.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.595
Okay, but if their sigil only trapped it,

24:31.804 --> 24:34.273
then how did Mary and her son's souls
get out of the nest?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.226
Maybe the trap forced their souls out?

24:37.518 --> 24:38.770
I don 't know.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.735
You know, there's got to be more to this.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.948
You know, it's too bad Bobby and Rufus
aren't around to see this stuff.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.404
They'd have been great Men of Letters.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.865
Yeah. Grumpy Old Men of Letters, but yeah.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.284
Wait a second. Check this out.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.750
Looks like the Men of Letters found a way
to kill soul eaters.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.049
Awesome. How?

25:01.250 --> 25:04.629
Well, it looks like it's another sigil.
More complicated. Uh, made from blood.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.973
You cut your hand and you paint
this badboy inside the house

25:08.173 --> 25:10.551
while the same thing is painted...

25:10.968 --> 25:12.140
Inside the nest.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.472
Which means one of us has to go in there.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.102
- Yeah.
- Not it.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.312
Dude.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.830
We are never settling anything
with that stupid game again. Ever.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.575
All right. I'll paint here.

25:34.825 --> 25:38.170
So, you paint yours here.

25:38.829 --> 25:41.503
Now, your sigil sets the table,
mine actually kills it.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.924
All right. You got your blood?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.298
Right here.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.677
- All right, let's do this.
- Yeah.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.977
If memory serves,
things are about to get hairy.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.357
You want to hold my hand?

26:17.201 --> 26:19.044
Keep paintin', Picasso.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.274
Come and get me, you son of a bitch!

27:26.520 --> 27:29.069
Stay away from me, you son of a bitch!

27:56.133 --> 27:57.350
Sam?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.309
Sam?

28:21.283 --> 28:22.500
Okay.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.061
Rufus?

28:45.098 --> 28:46.190
Oh, God!

28:57.152 --> 28:58.369
Are you real?

29:01.782 --> 29:02.908
Will Henderson?

29:03.700 --> 29:04.952
Yes, sir?

29:05.535 --> 29:06.707
Am I in trouble?

29:06.912 --> 29:09.165
No, no, no, son. Not at all.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.379
My name's Bobby Singer.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.593
And I'm here to...

29:15.128 --> 29:17.051
Well, I'm stuck here, too.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.263
But I'm gonna take care of you, okay?

29:21.635 --> 29:24.263
- Have you seen your mother?
- No.

29:24.930 --> 29:28.230
Have you seen anyone strange?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.189
You mean the sad people?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.236
The who?

29:32.479 --> 29:33.731
They're right behind you.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.324
They look sick. You don't see them?

29:45.742 --> 29:46.959
No.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.997
But we're gonna get out of here.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.957
My friend's gonna help us.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.259
Bobby?

30:00.549 --> 30:02.847
Bobby? Bobby?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.433
Bobby?

30:13.812 --> 30:17.487
Oldest damn rule, Bobby.
Oldest rule. I'm sorry.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.807
All right, I got you. Stay with me.
Okay, I can do all this.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.369
What are you doing?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.380
It's Kat, right?

31:14.456 --> 31:16.254
It's nice to meet you, Kat.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.129
Not supposed to talk to strangers.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.344
And that is a solid rule.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.847
My name's Dean Winchester. See?

31:30.138 --> 31:31.435
Now I'm not a stranger.

31:32.849 --> 31:36.149
I'm here to get you out of this place.
Have you seen your mom?

31:36.353 --> 31:39.357
I can't see her.
It's too crowded in here now.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.862
I don't see anybody.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.539
You'll see them soon.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.664
How about we get you out of here instead?

31:59.209 --> 32:01.712
Your mom's around here somewhere.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.886
We'll look for her. Stick together, okay?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.099
Mommy!

32:08.301 --> 32:10.929
No, wait. I said stick together.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.265
What the...

32:29.906 --> 32:31.203
Bobby?

32:33.410 --> 32:34.457
Whoa.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.297
Shoot me, you kill your friend.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.593
Rock salt. Bobby can handle it.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.801
Now, now. No need to hurt anyone.

32:45.046 --> 32:48.095
Just come along with me. Into the nest.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.144
Why? So you can show me
a bunch of messed-up stuff in there

32:51.344 --> 32:53.312
while my fabulous body rots out here?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.650
I don't think I want to take that ride.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.189
It's pretty.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.945
Thanks.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.448
I don't like it here.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.489
Yeah, me neither.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.492
And my brother,

33:14.701 --> 33:16.999
he's making a painting just like this one.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.962
And when he's done,
we're out of here. Okay?

33:22.459 --> 33:24.587
Come on, Sam, the table's set.
Let's do this.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.634
There's more of them now.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.450
Dean!

33:51.655 --> 33:53.874
I can't let you finish
that finger painting, boy.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.633
Just come with me. Into the nest.

34:06.836 --> 34:09.134
I can keep you safe. From The Darkness.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.808
Dean, listen to me.
I know you're in there. Fight this!

34:12.050 --> 34:14.849
Rufus, I can't let you trap me.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.225
Ooh.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.356
Then we got a problem there, don't we?

34:32.195 --> 34:33.788
Dean, stop this!

34:42.414 --> 34:44.963
You know your brother
wants to go to The Darkness.

34:45.542 --> 34:49.012
He needs to go. But I can keep him safe.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.047
Both of you. Forever.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.198
Yeah, that can't be good.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.115
They're leaving.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.901
Bobby? Bobby?

36:33.191 --> 36:34.568
You okay?

36:36.861 --> 36:38.408
What the hell just happened?

36:41.366 --> 36:44.666
Hey. Hey. Dean, Dean! You good? You good?

36:45.370 --> 36:47.714
All right. I got you.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.067
Well?

37:12.230 --> 37:15.484
Well, everybody's awake and happy.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.077
So, what happened?

37:18.278 --> 37:20.326
It was a trap spell.
We should be trapped, too.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.453
It was a Baku, Bobby.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.329
I killed it while you slept.
That'll be one bottle of Johnnie, please.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.665
- It wasn't a damn...
- The trap sigil pushed your souls out.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.216
Case closed. You're welcome.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.795
- I don't like it.
- Who gives a damn what you like?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.129
Take the win.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.931
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you okay, Bobby?

37:39.507 --> 37:40.633
I'm fine.

37:41.718 --> 37:42.719
Huh.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.559
You saw something.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.977
In the nest. Didn't you?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.062
What'd you see, Bobby?

37:54.731 --> 37:55.948
MY boys.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.910
Both of them. Both of them dead.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.364
Then I saw...

38:04.574 --> 38:07.828
- Well, I don't know what the hell I saw.
- Yeah, well...

38:09.954 --> 38:11.627
Forget the oldest rule, Bobby.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.880
Are you gettin' soft on me, Rufus?

38:15.084 --> 38:16.381
Yeah, soft this.

38:18.546 --> 38:19.672
Mm.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.060
No, no. I'm okay.
I can't wait to go home.

38:28.264 --> 38:31.894
Yeah, I still don't understand
what the hell just happened.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.759
All you need to know
is that your house is safe now.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.531
Kitchen may need a remodel, though.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.113
Mmm. That's okay. I think we're selling.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.362
Fair enough.
All right, take care of yourself.

38:42.612 --> 38:43.659
Thank you.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.707
For everything.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.824
Dean? You boys okay?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.555
Yeah, we're fine, Bobby.
Where the hell have you been?

39:26.614 --> 39:28.254
- I've left three messages.
- Well, I was...

39:28.283 --> 39:30.160
Look, I got a possible lead
on Lilith in Maine,

39:30.451 --> 39:32.874
but we're on a case in Reno.
I texted you the address,

39:33.162 --> 39:35.335
so if you're done sittin' on your ass...

39:41.462 --> 39:44.932
And here's another classic
as our Flashback Lunch continues.

39:45.592 --> 39:46.718
Idjits.

40:07.196 --> 40:11.042
Okay. You know, Bobby's journal never
mentioned him going into the nest.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.619
It didn't say anything, actually.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.746
You think it really was him or...

40:15.538 --> 40:19.042
I don't know.
Maybe it's like you said before.

40:19.292 --> 40:23.172
That Bobby and Rufus' trap sigil forced
their souls out of the nest back then,

40:23.379 --> 40:26.007
and that the soul eater was just
making me see things.

40:26.925 --> 40:30.930
However, if Bobby did go
into the nest back then

40:31.512 --> 40:35.983
and you said that the nest exists
outside of space and time, then...

40:37.685 --> 40:41.815
Theoretically, couldn't he and I have
been there at the same time? Right?

40:43.858 --> 40:45.030
My head hurts.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.474
Well, let's get drunk
and not think about this ever again.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.372
First we gotta stop in Tennessee, though.
Bobby's old soul eater case.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.703
He wouldn't want any unfinished business

40:51.866 --> 40:53.493
on the books, you know.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.375
Fine. This time, you're going to the nest.

41:02.794 --> 41:07.174
Hey, you said the soul eater
made you see "things." Plural.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.059
So, what else did you see?

41:12.220 --> 41:14.473
I saw you. Dead on the floor.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.483
What?

41:18.393 --> 41:19.485
Uh...

41:19.727 --> 41:21.400
How messed up are our lives

41:21.646 --> 41:25.071
that you seeing a vision of dead me
is actually kind of comforting?

41:27.068 --> 41:28.570
Yeah.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.616
And here's the last classic
of the day.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.083
Let's take it on the road
with the Allman Brothers.

42:16.868 --> 42:17.869
English - SDH
