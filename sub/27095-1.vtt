00:42.309 --> 00:43.208
            Sweetie!

00:43.244 --> 00:45.010
         There you are.

00:45.046 --> 00:46.011
         Hey, daddy...

00:46.047 --> 00:46.879
              Hey.

00:46.947 --> 00:47.646
              Hey.

00:47.681 --> 00:48.547
              Oh.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.548
           Hey Mols'.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.083
  You ready for your close-up?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.018
 We're taking the family photo
in front of the tree this year.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.953
  Yeah, but we always decorate
       the tree together.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.890
  I...I brought some ornaments
      from the old house.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.491
            Oh wow.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.692
         Hello darling.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.493
            Hi mom!

01:01.529 --> 01:02.961
              Hey.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.797
 You know the service has been
  doing such a fantastic job

01:04.831 --> 01:06.532
     on the exterior these
       past few seasons

01:06.567 --> 01:08.967
that I thought I'd have them do
      the tree this year.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.569
   Yeah. It's just we always
       have so much fun

01:10.604 --> 01:12.538
 decorating the tree together.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.273
      Where is the angel?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.308
      Somehow it got lost
       during the move.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.443
         Oh, sorry Dad.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.577
   I know that angel has been
         in your family

01:18.612 --> 01:20.679
  ever since you were little.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.047
      Yeah, it's a shame,

01:22.083 --> 01:23.415
    I mean it... It's always
     my favourite ornament

01:23.451 --> 01:24.483
          on the tree.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.951
    I just loved sharing it
        with you girls.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.453
          [soft laugh]

01:27.488 --> 01:29.221
         Ah, it's okay.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.556
   Time to make new memories.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.157
            Exactly.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.793
   I didn't realize you were
        so sentimental.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.663
              Um.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.798
   Michelle, tell your sister
         the big news.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.634
       [under her breath]
             What?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.471
         She's engaged.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.972
      Your little sister
      is getting married!

01:47.007 --> 01:48.006
             What!

01:48.042 --> 01:49.108
     Harris finally popped
         the question?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.876
  Mom. It's not official yet.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.979
  But I did find a little bag
       from the jeweller

01:54.014 --> 01:55.981
    and I think it could be
         any day now.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.116
          Oh my gosh!

01:57.184 --> 01:57.883
     I'm gonna be the maid
       of honour, right?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.318
     [girls laugh together]

01:59.353 --> 02:01.653
  Molly, baby. Is there anyone
   special you would like me

02:01.722 --> 02:03.021
      to add to our list?

02:03.057 --> 02:06.925
     Because I'm finalizing
        the guest list.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.261
             Um...

02:09.330 --> 02:12.798
    Nope. Just gonna be me.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.833
     But I'm really excited
        to see everyone.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.001
        That'll be nice.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.570
   You know if you come back
          to work...

02:18.606 --> 02:20.439
 You'd have steady hours again.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.008
   And you'd be able to spend
 more time in your social life.

02:23.077 --> 02:26.645
 How else are you going to find
     a Harris of your own?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.481
    We haven't met somebody
    you've dated since Evan.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.883
    Yeah, I'm just, I'm not
       really interested

02:30.918 --> 02:32.151
    in finding another Evan.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.786
   I'm interested in starting
        my own business.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.589
  Alright. You get this out of
  your system, this app thing.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.759
  And then... then you'll come
  back to Hoffman Accounting.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.094
       Where you belong.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.196
  You know how hard she's been
      working on creating

02:44.231 --> 02:45.664
      Mingle All the Way.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.766
 Yes, I do and it's a perfectly
           fine hobby

02:47.835 --> 02:49.401
  to work on in your own time.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.602
   You know, actually, mom...

02:50.638 --> 02:52.037
  I've always wanted to start
        my own company.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.272
    And Mingle All the Way,

02:53.340 --> 02:54.540
  it's already up and running
       in the App Store.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.808
     We have quite a few...
        users, that's...

02:56.844 --> 02:58.377
             Mhmm.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.780
We'll talk about this again when
daddy and I get back from Aspen.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.781
            [sighs]

03:02.816 --> 03:05.317
        Okay. Uh, so...

03:05.352 --> 03:07.319
     let's, um, let's take
      this family photo.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.321
    I kinda have to get back
      to my office and...

03:09.356 --> 03:11.523
       Work on my hobby.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.733
          Uncle Jeff!

03:21.769 --> 03:23.502
       Greetings, family.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.304
 Your decorations have arrived.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.707
 Thanks, but you know we bought
  plenty of ornaments already.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.543
Oh, Frank, old buddy, you can't
    buy sentimental value.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.313
 Some of these go back to when
 Erika and I were growing up.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.847
Still haven't found mom's angel.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.716
Sorry, sis. I looked everywhere.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.151
          What angel?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.086
 When your mom and I were kids,

03:41.121 --> 03:42.621
   we used to go to the store
           every year

03:42.656 --> 03:44.656
    to pick out a decoration
     with your grandmother.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.490
          Sounds fun!

03:45.526 --> 03:46.992
              Oh!

03:47.027 --> 03:50.495
Maybe we can go to the store to
find one when we're done here.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.898
         Sorry, kiddo.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.800
   I have to go to the office
        this afternoon.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.368
      This new ad campaign
        we're designing

03:56.403 --> 03:57.836
   needs some serious fixing.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.338
  That's what you always say.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.174
 You're not even in the design
   department anymore, Jeff.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.942
  Seriously, it's the weekend.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.211
   You promised you'd help me
  with my Christmas stockings.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.680
        I'm giving them
       to my whole class.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.582
       I will, I promise.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.284
          But first...

04:12.353 --> 04:14.186
  Why don't we get this house
      properly decorated!

04:14.221 --> 04:15.520
              Yes!

04:15.589 --> 04:16.721
          Let's do it!

04:16.757 --> 04:18.923
      Riley, for you and..

04:18.959 --> 04:20.091
  (whispers) What's in there?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.726
           Thank you.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.728
         Okay, come on.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.263
      Let's get this tree
         put together.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.571
     Do you think the notes
       cover everything?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.939
    Maybe we should go over
          the presen-

04:33.974 --> 04:35.274
We checked them a zillion times.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.341
      It's gonna be great!

04:36.377 --> 04:38.277
    Let's just run the pitch
         one more time.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.711
    Helen Lange isn't going
      to invest in my app

04:39.747 --> 04:41.647
    unless the presentation
         is flawless.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.981
   Let's take a deep breath.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.383
There is no time for breathing.
          Or eating.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.118
     Don't you dare tell me
   that you've been sleeping.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.519
     Mrs. Lange is already
          interested.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.554
  That's why she's invited us
   to this breakfast meeting

04:49.590 --> 04:50.889
      at her private club.

04:50.924 --> 04:54.259
  But you might actually scare
     her off if you show up

04:54.295 --> 04:56.762
looking like a deranged zombie.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.096
          Okay. Fine.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.265
I promise that I will go to bed
     at a reasonable hour

05:00.301 --> 05:02.100
if you show me the updated logo.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.468
            Agreed.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.270
And maybe you could do something
     fun one of these days?

05:05.306 --> 05:07.272
   You remember "fun" right?

05:07.308 --> 05:08.740
  There will be plenty of time
            for fun

05:08.776 --> 05:11.009
     once we get Mingle All
      the Way on the map.

05:11.045 --> 05:11.943
             Ta-da!

05:14.548 --> 05:15.414
        [knock at door]

05:15.449 --> 05:16.281
            <i> Molly?</i>

05:17.284 --> 05:18.450
        Are you in here?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.451
           Lisa! Hi!

05:19.520 --> 05:20.252
       Yeah, come on in!

05:20.321 --> 05:21.353
              Hi!

05:21.388 --> 05:22.487
              Hi!

05:22.523 --> 05:23.955
        Oh, and welcome,
     you are now officially

05:23.991 --> 05:25.424
   in the Mingle All the Way
         headquarters.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.858
 Well, temporary headquarters.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.660
   We'll have a proper office
          soon enough.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.128
        This is awesome.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.830
       Lisa, meet Tyler,
      my business partner

05:31.865 --> 05:33.965
and incredible graphic designer.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.135
    Tyler meet Lisa, my most
       successful friend.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.270
    What are you doing here?

05:38.305 --> 05:39.471
     I just wanted to wish
        you good luck.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.639
      Oh, that's so sweet.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.040
     It's great to finally
      meet you, actually.

05:42.076 --> 05:45.010
I've heard so much about Molly's
    genius college roommate.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.111
              Oh.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.946
       [laughs nervously]
            Hardly!

05:47.981 --> 05:50.048
   Molly is the real genius.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.350
       I've made my match
         for the season

05:51.385 --> 05:52.784
    and I'm ready to mingle

05:52.853 --> 05:56.088
thanks to her incredible system,
   I no longer have to answer

05:56.123 --> 05:57.923
  why I'm not seeing anyone...

05:57.958 --> 05:58.990
             again.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.559
        Or go to my work
        functions alone.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.760
            Exactly.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.462
  I invented my App for people
         just like you.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.730
      It's gonna be huge.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.099
      I am so proud of you
   for following your dreams.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.433
            Thanks.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.435
 You are coming to my Christmas
      office party, right?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.837
  I think I'm over Christmas.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.672
     It's just become such
      a corporate ordeal.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.207
 How can you be over Christmas?

06:15.242 --> 06:16.508
       You have to come!

06:16.543 --> 06:18.310
    The only way I was able
   to get Swift Technologies

06:18.345 --> 06:21.813
off the ground is because I took
    networking so seriously.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.083
    You might meet potential
           investors.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.251
             Fine.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.387
    You know, you two make
    a very convincing team.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.322
   I just hope that your idea
       of a holiday party

06:30.357 --> 06:32.391
    is much more personality
       than my mother's.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.359
  You'll enjoy it, I promise.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.094
       Oh, and hey Molly.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.163
    If you have any worries
  with your Christmas parties,

06:38.198 --> 06:40.232
      you can always join
      Mingle All the Way.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.666
  Uh, that won't be necessary.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.935
   Somebody has to stay here
   and handle the business.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.370
      Um, I'm right here.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.671
             Mhmm.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.213
           Yo, Jeff!

06:55.249 --> 06:57.349
   Hey are you still working
    on that Brady mock up?

06:57.384 --> 07:00.819
 Is that code for "thanks Jeff
   for fixing my disastrous

07:00.854 --> 07:03.755
 "efforts on this ad campaign"
   'cause I'm happy to help.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.024
       Hmm. You're needed
       in the boardroom.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.960
     Mr. Grayson is making
       an announcement.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.696
  That, uh, looks surprisingly
            sharp...

07:13.934 --> 07:14.766
            ...Ish.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.005
    She's a successful CEO,
        career driven,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.606
   and a leader in her field.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.875
  Yet whenever she is invited
     to a corporate event,

07:23.911 --> 07:25.977
 the only thing people ask her
      is who she's dating

07:26.013 --> 07:27.813
 and why she isn't married yet.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.283
   See, Lisa doesn't want you
 to set her up on a blind date.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.151
 She wants your business card.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.853
     My niece has a similar
           complaint.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.054
        She's a lawyer.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.789
    Well yes, your algorithm
     is rather impressive.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.091
 That's actually why I invited
        you here today.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.929
 I'm interested in working with
  emerging innovators in tech.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.364
Molly is even being interviewed
  on the local news this week

07:46.400 --> 07:48.166
  as an entrepreneur to watch.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.802
    We believe that our app
  is ready for the next level.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.171
  With an infusion of capital
  we could hire a full staff

07:53.207 --> 07:55.207
 and market on a larger scale.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.775
        Tell me, why is
  Mingle All the Way different

07:56.844 --> 07:58.643
       than all the other
     dating apps out there?

07:58.679 --> 08:01.146
      Because our matches
  aren't created for romance.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.447
           Excuse me?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.649
Unlike traditional dating apps,
      Mingle All the Way

08:04.685 --> 08:07.085
    isn't for people looking
      for a relationship.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.688
 Our users are perfectly happy
       remaining single,

08:09.723 --> 08:12.123
    they simply need someone
  to go to an event with them.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.793
     Imagine showing up at
 your industry party or parties

08:14.828 --> 08:17.395
     with an ambitious and
intelligent person on your arm.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.097
      Not only do you make
      a great impression,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.333
but you have someone to navigate
        the crowd with.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.869
 Once a match is made, our pair
   agrees to a set of events

08:23.904 --> 08:26.004
where they will be each other's
      platonic plus one.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.906
 We find it to be an extremely
           efficient

08:27.941 --> 08:29.474
    networking arrangement.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.209
    I know a ton of friends
    that would love to try

08:31.245 --> 08:32.277
      something like that.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.645
  Before I invest in anything

08:33.679 --> 08:36.114
 I would really like to see it
          in action.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.049
      So, tell me, Molly.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.318
 Do you use Mingle All the Way?

08:41.788 --> 08:43.788
      As a matter of fact,
        she just joined.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.824
   Molly has so many parties
     to attend this season

08:45.893 --> 08:48.393
  we agreed it was the perfect
   time for her to experience

08:48.428 --> 08:51.730
Mingle All the Way for herself.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.498
    Why don't I demonstrate
         why mingling

08:53.534 --> 08:56.334
       is the next major
       social innovation?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.435
            Alright.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.538
  Why don't you spend the next
           few weeks

08:59.573 --> 09:01.373
 as a Mingle All the Way user,

09:01.408 --> 09:04.342
   and then bring your match
    to our Christmas gala?

09:04.378 --> 09:07.112
    If I'm aptly impressed,
          who knows?

09:07.147 --> 09:11.316
   There might be an investor
       in your stocking.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.751
         Sounds great.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.219
           Wonderful.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.898
        Hello, everyone.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.068
    I am delighted to share
    some very exciting news.

09:30.103 --> 09:34.205
    Grayson Advertising will
      be opening its first
       Los Angeles office

09:34.274 --> 09:36.107
   right after the holidays.

09:36.143 --> 09:40.211
           [applause]

09:40.280 --> 09:43.348
Now, the person I appoint to run
        this new office

09:43.383 --> 09:45.784
    will be someone who fits
 with our corporate philosophy.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.085
      And here at Grayson,

09:47.120 --> 09:51.022
    we value stability and
 commitment in our executives.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.424
  That's very reasonable, sir.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.359
   I'll be making my decision
      before the new year.

09:54.394 --> 09:57.696
           [applause]

09:57.764 --> 09:59.297
           Thank you.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.833
     Would you and Melissa
    still be able to join us

10:01.868 --> 10:03.001
      for dinner tonight?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.936
   Absolutely. We can't wait.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.775
 I can just send you a postcard
           from L.A.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.145
  Slow down, Brent, we're both
    in the running for this.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.047

    Oh, is there a problem?

11:24.618 --> 11:27.152
   No, I hope not. It's just
    I saw this angel first

  I was supposed to surprise
my dad and it would mean a lot-

11:34.461 --> 11:35.894
 And this is going to kick off
        her collection.

 find something for your dad.

         until we move
      into a real office.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.513
 And we'll change the seasonal
     motif of the artwork

14:08.548 --> 14:09.848
      throughout the year.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.916

burst out with that suggestion.

       to show Mrs. Lange

14:43.683 --> 14:45.016
  how the app actually works.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.085
   Number two, I think it'll
   actually do you some good.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.954
Well, I guess if I do have to go
      to all those tedious

14:49.990 --> 14:53.124
  Christmas parties then I can
 kill two birds with one stone.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.359
       That's the spirit.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.560
            Sort of.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.895
And, as a bonus, you get to give
        your social life

14:56.930 --> 14:58.830
  some much-needed attention.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.798
 Is my mother brainwashing you?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.100
     She does have a point.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.868
      You know what, it is
old-fashioned comments like hers

15:03.904 --> 15:05.503
   that motivated me to start
       Mingle All the Way

15:05.538 --> 15:06.471
      in the first place.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.672
            [sighs]

15:07.741 --> 15:09.240
  My mother wants me to spend
       all of my energy

15:09.276 --> 15:11.676
 finding a boyfriend but I have
 no intention of being diverted

15:11.711 --> 15:13.811
       by a relationship.

15:13.847 --> 15:17.515

15:17.550 --> 15:19.183
           So pretty.

15:19.252 --> 15:19.751
              Hey.

15:19.786 --> 15:20.718
              Hey!

15:20.754 --> 15:21.886
          You made it!

15:21.922 --> 15:23.121
           Hey Riley!

15:23.156 --> 15:25.223
     I think these are what
    you've been waiting for.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.091
  Perfect, thanks Uncle Jeff!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.227
     You're welcome, kiddo!

15:29.262 --> 15:30.495
        That's for you.

15:33.233 --> 15:37.936
   So, I think I need to find
            a date.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.304
      That's a great idea.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.406
  It's about time you got back
           out there.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.575
     Don't get too excited,
     it's nothing romantic.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.511
 But Mr. Grayson keeps inviting
         my colleagues

15:46.546 --> 15:49.013
  out to these couples dinners
   and I need to be included.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.581
    There's no other way you
     can get his attention?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.050
          Not really.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.118
  All the top execs are family
  types and I need to fit in.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.253
            Well...

15:55.288 --> 15:56.554
    It wouldn't be a tragedy
       for you to go out

15:56.623 --> 15:58.089
      once in a blue moon.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.924
There's more to life than work.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.793
 Focusing on the business side
        of the company

16:01.828 --> 16:03.461
      is how I'll move up.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.296
      Please, just help me
      with this promotion.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.364
You must know some single women
         I could take

16:06.399 --> 16:08.466
 to my office Christmas party.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.035
 None that want to play pretend
           with you.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.306
       Okay, my friend...
        Enough stalling.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.741
       Enough analytics.

16:16.776 --> 16:17.942
       It's profile time.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.177
         You're right.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.979
    Talking about myself is
    my least favourite hobby

16:21.014 --> 16:23.081
     but I can't put it off
          any longer.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.649
       But I can see that
      you kind of want to,

16:24.684 --> 16:25.917
      so, how about this:

16:25.952 --> 16:27.218
        You go outside,
      get some fresh air,

16:27.253 --> 16:28.920
   find something to do that
        doesn't involve

16:28.955 --> 16:32.023
 sitting in front of a computer
      and I'll set it up
        for you instead.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.324
  I think I know your hobbies
          well enough

16:33.360 --> 16:35.326
  to get it sounding like you.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.527
       You are a prince.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.795
          Oh! But hey.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.797
   Don't put anything cheesy
     on my profile, okay?

16:39.833 --> 16:42.000
   No long walks at the beach
     or anything like that.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.167
            Got it.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.702
Business plans and spreadsheets
            it is.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.471
And I'll add some personal stuff
    to give it some flavour.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.106
     Nothing too personal,
         but you know,

16:48.141 --> 16:49.107
       you want a match
       that you can have

16:49.142 --> 16:50.408
a good conversation with, right?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.310
     Yeah and go ahead and
    add puppies on the list.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.911
     You know, any guy that
         likes puppies

16:53.947 --> 16:56.147
   must be tolerable company.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.548
   Deal. Now get out of here!

16:58.218 --> 17:00.618
   So, what's your game plan?

17:00.653 --> 17:04.188
       You ever heard of
      Mingle All the Way?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.624
 You're joining online dating?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.026
           Not quite.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.460
      It's a unique thing
        for networking

17:09.496 --> 17:10.762
but I think it's my best option

17:10.797 --> 17:13.064
      if I want to impress
          Mr. Grayson.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.233
 And besides, I don't hear you
    throwing out any ideas.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.769
   Oh, well, no, I am setting
        you up right now

17:17.804 --> 17:19.069
  before you change your mind.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.505
   I will arrange everything.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.006
 Just make me sound appealing.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.541
    Uh, girls like puppies.
  Girls are into that, right?

17:24.577 --> 17:25.742
            [laughs]

17:25.811 --> 17:26.810
    Okay, I'll text you with
     my upcoming schedule.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.979
    Thank you so much, sis.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.547
    Trust me. And I will let
      you know as soon as

17:29.582 --> 17:31.349
I've got your first date set up!

17:31.384 --> 17:32.350
         Okay. Thanks.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.351
              Bye!

    back in the dating world

17:39.092 --> 17:40.892
      he is gonna remember
        how great it is

18:39.352 --> 18:40.852
       near Lisa's party.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.055
I figured since we encourage our
 matches to meet up one on one

18:44.090 --> 18:45.289
      to make sure they're
          comfortable,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.657

     Oh, also, your profile
     does say that you work
      for a tech start up,

18:56.970 --> 18:59.070
     but I thought it best
     to leave out the whole

18:59.105 --> 19:00.771
 "you developed the app" thing.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.839

             Smart!

19:02.942 --> 19:04.142
       This guy might get
       a little concerned

19:04.177 --> 19:06.177
   if he thinks I have access
      to his information.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.211

19:07.247 --> 19:08.713

   Trust me, neither would I!

19:51.257 --> 19:54.592
I knew I should've let my sister
       set up my profile.

      Extra whipped cream.
          Nice touch.

20:05.138 --> 20:06.971
 So this is probably a mistake,
 let's just forget about this.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.372
     We could both rematch
      with other people.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.408
  I mean, I could find someone
   a little more gentlemanly.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.977
     And I can find someone
     a little less clumsy.

20:15.315 --> 20:21.285

   If I had known what colour
     you were going to wear

21:12.138 --> 21:14.872

21:28.621 --> 21:29.587

21:42.302 --> 21:43.501
  I can't take all the credit
            for it.

       and it's up to you

21:45.638 --> 21:48.139
   to see who suits you best.

    So how do you guys know
          each other?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.411
Oh, we met the traditional way.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.879
        Girl meets boy,

21:54.947 --> 21:57.415
  boy ruthlessly steals girl's
  amazing Christmas gift idea.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.950
     Girl mercilessly ruins
   boy's Christmas stockings.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.419
      The standard stuff.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.355
   One of my biggest clients
         just arrived.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.823
       I have to say hi.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.392
    But you guys circulate,
       enjoy yourselves.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.493
     Nice to meet you both.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.494
           Likewise.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.601
  So, am I behaving acceptably
            for you?

22:17.637 --> 22:18.969
     Yeah. So far so good.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.604
    But the night is young.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.505
              Hmm.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.506
              Oh!

22:23.976 --> 22:25.209
    Actually, ladies first.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.744
 Oh, no I wouldn't dream of it.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.513
    Taking the last item is
  your signature move, right?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.082
            Hmmm...

22:37.190 --> 22:40.791
   So, have you done anything
       like this before?

22:40.827 --> 22:42.560
  Mingle All the Way, I mean.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.061
            Oh, no.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.463
    But, I hear it's great.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.698
     I don't know, I think
 it's a little weird, honestly.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.166
     But, desperate times,
         as they say.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.668
   I'm sorry, are you calling
         me desperate?

22:50.703 --> 22:53.104
     Because as I recall,
  you also needed a plus one.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.739
   I'm sorry, I was referring
           to myself.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.141
   I need someone impressive
    to introduce to my boss

22:57.176 --> 22:58.876
   so he'll invite me to his
       personal events.

22:58.911 --> 23:02.446
        So you're sayin'
        I'm impressive?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.548
            Oh yeah.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.083
    Ooh. Now we're talking.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.152
      If you will remember
           our deal.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.920
         Oh, um, yeah.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.022
   Uh, is it possible to get
      one of these cakes

23:12.058 --> 23:13.958
      with the whip cream
         on the side?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.693
Of course, you're one of those.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.827
          One of what?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.763
       The type who can't
      just enjoy something

23:18.798 --> 23:19.964
 without making it complicated.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.198
          Okay, cool.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.733
            Mm-hmm.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.737
       I stand corrected.

23:30.276 --> 23:33.677
  So I gather your start up's
         also in tech?

23:33.713 --> 23:36.647
  You here, what, scoping out
       the competition?

23:36.682 --> 23:38.582
 Oh no, Lisa's my best friend.

23:38.618 --> 23:39.884
       And our companies
     are really different.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.188
     I mean, mine's an app
   for efficient scheduling.

23:44.223 --> 23:47.091
   Well, she throws one heck
     of a Christmas party.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.094
      Yeah, if you're into
      that sort of thing.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.662
   Who isn't into Christmas?

23:51.697 --> 23:52.863
         I don't know.
      I'm kind of over it.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.498
  I feel like it's a whole lot
         of obligations

23:54.534 --> 23:56.333
    and fanfare for nothing.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.202
It's just not enjoyable anymore.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.004
         Now I get it.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.005
           Get what?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.373
        You're a Grinch.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.974

           about you.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.111

24:07.180 --> 24:08.312
   No, that's not it at all,
     I'm just really busy

24:08.347 --> 24:09.914
 so I'd rather focus, you know,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.049
    all of my energy on work
     instead of waste time

24:12.084 --> 24:13.918
      with phony emotions.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.339

24:49.322 --> 24:50.588
             Awful.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.723
   He is totally smug, he is
    way too into Christmas,

24:52.758 --> 24:54.758
    and, to top it all off,
 he's the guy I told you about

24:54.794 --> 24:56.627
       who stole my dad's
        Christmas gift.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.561
             What?

24:57.597 --> 24:58.062
              Yep.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.196
           Seriously?

24:59.232 --> 25:01.165
             Mhmm.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.601
      Man, uh, he seemed
     like a perfect match.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.935
    His profile was ideal...

25:04.971 --> 25:05.803
           It's fine.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.271
 I don't have to like the guy.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.906
 I just need someone who will
go on a few work events with me

25:08.941 --> 25:09.740

25:09.809 --> 25:11.141

 Well, I'll leave the negative
     report of Jeff out of

        You wore props.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.025
         He wore props.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.760
  Nope, you can just go ahead
     and turn that around

25:29.795 --> 25:31.061

           at staring

28:30.142 --> 28:32.042
  I just make a rigorous list
       of pros and cons

28:32.078 --> 28:35.079
 and then I cross reference it
with objective statistical data.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.413
    I find it very helpful.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.882
  Okay darling, no need to get
        all nerdy on us.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.384
   Quite prudent, young lady.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.654
  Jeffrey, don't go hiding her
         away anymore.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.522
    Say, would you two like
    to join me and my family

28:45.558 --> 28:48.092
    for carolling next week?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.793
           Um, uh...

28:49.829 --> 28:50.694
      We wouldn't miss it.

28:50.763 --> 28:51.929
     Well, that's terrific.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.664
   Now, if you'll excuse me.

28:54.867 --> 28:59.169
 So how... how did you two kids
          meet anyway?

28:59.205 --> 29:02.005
   Oh, well, Jeff and I met
   at a negotiation seminar.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.042
   Jeff bested me, he has a
   finely-crafted technique.

29:05.077 --> 29:05.843
  You are being far too kind.

29:05.878 --> 29:06.944
  We both know you let me win.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.712
            Oh, no.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.415
 You know I, I, I would love it
    if you could just maybe

29:11.484 --> 29:13.016
   just show me a tip or two.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.218
       I'd be delighted.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.919
    Just as soon as I tweak
      your latest design.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.455
Okay, it doesn't need tweaking.
          It's fine.

29:20.726 --> 29:21.759
         You killed it.

29:21.827 --> 29:22.493
       That was amazing.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.627
      What were you doing?

29:23.662 --> 29:24.495
             What?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.929
       What do you mean?

29:25.965 --> 29:28.198
  I mean, you had no business
  calling me your girlfriend.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.500
     I mean, come on Jeff.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.501
  You know how the app works,
     it's for networking.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.136
    Not fake relationships.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.504
   I got a little impulsive.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.672
But it worked and it was amazing
     and my sister is going

29:35.741 --> 29:37.241
       to owe me a drink
    when I see her tomorrow.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.878
 Tell your sister that you will
      be carolling alone.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.045
            [sighs]

29:47.853 --> 29:51.121
    Ty, I think I completely
           messed up.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.556
    Do you think it would be
     too late to start over

29:52.591 --> 29:54.057
       with a new match?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.125
           Be honest.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.693
      Hmm. It's not ideal.

29:56.729 --> 29:58.695
  I mean, Mrs. Lange's already
    seen both your profiles

29:58.731 --> 30:00.197
and how the match was generated.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.832
    So yeah, it's not going
    to look good to tell her

30:01.867 --> 30:03.567
your first match was a misfire.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.969
  Especially since you created
            the app.

30:06.005 --> 30:06.970
             Right.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.338
        [phone ringing]

30:08.374 --> 30:10.808
        Perfect timing.

30:10.843 --> 30:11.742
            Hi mom!

30:11.777 --> 30:12.709
          How are you?

30:12.745 --> 30:13.777
             Good.

30:13.813 --> 30:14.912
   I was just calling to see

30:14.947 --> 30:16.713
       if you're still on
       for family dinner.

30:16.782 --> 30:17.948
     Well, that'll be nice.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.349
 Is there anything I can bring?
        Maybe a dessert?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.485
    <i> No, Michelle is making</i>
      <i> her apple pies so,</i>

30:21.520 --> 30:22.953
     <i> just bring yourself.</i>

30:22.988 --> 30:24.755
  I don't suppose there's any
  reason to set an extra place

30:24.790 --> 30:26.190
      at the table, right?

30:26.225 --> 30:27.791
          For a guest.

30:27.827 --> 30:29.426
  <i> Because I. I..as s wpeaking</i>
         <i> with Vivian,</i>

30:29.461 --> 30:30.794
      <i> our old neighbour,</i>

30:30.863 --> 30:32.496
   and she said that her son
   Phillip was back in town.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.831
       So I was thinkin-

30:33.866 --> 30:35.265
 Well, tell Phillip he'll have
     to find another date

30:35.301 --> 30:37.234
because I have a new boyfriend.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.007
         Up, up, okay.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.310
    A little higher, higher.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.411
          There, yeah.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.146
         Hi. Excuse me.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.848
 <i> Listen, I know you're having</i>
       <i> a private event</i>

30:50.916 --> 30:52.983
<i>but I'm just looking for Jeff?</i>

30:53.018 --> 30:56.653
   Oh, uh, he's right there.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.355
            Thanks.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.259
    Look, I made a mistake
 and if you would just let me-

31:02.294 --> 31:04.461
Look, I have a proposal for you.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.364
You need help with your boss and
now I need help with my mother.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.133
    So, what if we just keep
     our events as planned

31:10.202 --> 31:13.036
 plus dinner with my family and
 then I will say whatever it is

31:13.105 --> 31:15.639
you want me to say to your boss.

31:19.445 --> 31:23.146
  Would you like to be my fake
    boyfriend for Christmas?

31:23.182 --> 31:25.082
   I thought you'd never ask.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.718
  Actually do have a potential
client dinner coming up tonight.

31:27.786 --> 31:31.388
   Oh, well I would just be
delighted to join you, darling.

31:31.423 --> 31:32.823
             Hmm...

31:34.226 --> 31:37.227
 Wow, this place hasn't changed
             a bit.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.930
   Sorry, I have to see this.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.965
   I... I used to live nearby
        when I was a kid

31:42.034 --> 31:43.500
      and when my parents
        would work late

31:43.535 --> 31:45.602
  my sister and I would do our
homework here after high school.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.705
 So you've always been a nerd?

31:48.741 --> 31:49.873
              Huh.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.141
 Wow, that must have been back

31:51.176 --> 31:53.110
       when Frank senior
      was running things.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.846
Do you think, maybe, if we knew
     each other back then

31:55.881 --> 31:57.314
        we'd get along?

31:57.349 --> 31:59.516
      During high school?
         Not a chance.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.385
          I was cool.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.120
          Oh, please.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.923
     You were president of
  the AV club all four years.

32:05.991 --> 32:07.791
            [laughs]

32:07.826 --> 32:09.593
          Oh, you can
     never tease me again.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.796
 Hey there, I am Molly and you
are clearly my new best friend.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.464
 What do I owe you for that bit
        of information?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.033
 Yeah, that one's on the house.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.634
 I'm Erika. I'm Jeff's sister.

32:17.670 --> 32:18.869
    Oh, sorry to hear that.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.337
            [laughs]

32:20.406 --> 32:22.105
Uncle Jeff, we're ready to start
   decorating the ornaments.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.107
      Why don't you say hi
         to Molly here.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.342
           Hi there!

32:25.411 --> 32:29.012
    Oh, my gosh I... I love
         your outfit.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.981
     Do you work for Santa?

32:31.016 --> 32:32.282
      That's just my dad.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.151
        The real Santa's
       in the North Pole.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.552
          Don't tell.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.856
       She's really cute.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.058
     Uh, well, I should go.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.659
    Jeff just text me where
    to meet you later, okay?

32:42.695 --> 32:43.560
              No!

32:43.595 --> 32:44.528
             Stay.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.662
        You can help me
       with my ornaments.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.364
    We make them every year.

32:47.433 --> 32:50.767
  Well actually, I think Molly
   is allergic to Christmas.

32:50.836 --> 32:54.004
That is a terrible thing to say.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.605
   I would love to help you,
   but you know you're going

32:55.641 --> 32:57.574
   to have to help me because
  I don't know what I'm doing.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.775
             Okay.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.143
 I'm going to find my favourite
          paintbrush.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.511
     You can use that one.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.280
             Okay.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.748
         Oh, so sweet.

33:04.783 --> 33:05.983
            She is.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.651
     I better go help her.

33:07.686 --> 33:08.518
    You're gonna be alright?

33:08.554 --> 33:09.519
      Oh, yeah definitely.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.887
     Me and my new gal pal,

33:10.923 --> 33:12.689
     we're gonna swap some
    juicy stories about you.

33:12.725 --> 33:13.523
              Yup.

33:14.793 --> 33:15.826
            [sighs]

33:15.861 --> 33:17.761
Hey, I, um, I know that you guys

33:17.796 --> 33:19.830
   didn't exactly hit it off
           at first,

33:19.865 --> 33:22.899
but I can assure you, my brother
     is a really good guy.

33:22.935 --> 33:24.835
   Yeah, he'll make a decent
           wing man.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.803
 I'm glad he's out socializing.

33:26.839 --> 33:27.938
     And it's good that you
         guys matched,

33:27.973 --> 33:30.574
       even if it is only
     for business purposes.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.342
   That is all it is, right?

33:32.378 --> 33:33.610
              Yep.

33:33.645 --> 33:34.945
    Yeah, I mean business is
         up and running

33:35.014 --> 33:37.714
      so I don't have time
      for a relationship.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.082
   Well, I guess you both had
          good reasons

33:39.118 --> 33:40.751
for joining Mingle All the Way.

33:40.786 --> 33:41.651
              Mm.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.986
              Huh.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.654
  Come on! Everything's ready!

33:44.723 --> 33:46.089
           Oh, good.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.292
        This'll be fun.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.429
 Wow, I, uh, I wish I'd knew we
 were gonna be crafting today.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.465
   I... I have zero aptitude
        for this stuff.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.600
           Aptitude?

33:56.635 --> 33:57.667
      This isn't the SAT.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.036
     It's called merriment.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.137
              Oh!

34:00.172 --> 34:01.171
            [laughs]

34:01.240 --> 34:02.406
           I'm sorry.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.041
        It's forgivable.

34:05.878 --> 34:10.580
   This doesn't look like a
 networking arrangement to me.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.282
 I wouldn't get your hopes up.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.385
             Don't!

34:16.487 --> 34:18.422
  So, I've been trying to land
     this account for ages.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.023
            Hmm-Mm.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.190
    I haven't brought in any
    significant new clients
        in a few months

34:21.226 --> 34:23.126
 so this would be a really big
          win for me.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.094
Okay, well, let me know if there
   is anything in particular

34:25.130 --> 34:26.897
      you want me to say.

34:26.931 --> 34:30.699
 I have so many ideas for a new
 Diamonds are Forever campaign.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.003
   Heather, you should know
 that Jeff has a very thorough

34:33.038 --> 34:34.371
       creative process.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.739
   I like the sound of that.

34:35.774 --> 34:39.509
     You could even call it
     his aesthetic vision.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.411
  Jeff, why don't you send me
        a cost proposal

34:41.447 --> 34:43.547
   of what you have in mind
 and we'll take it from there.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.282
     You'll have it before
         the holidays.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.050
           Wonderful.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.418
  Now, shall we order dessert?

34:49.487 --> 34:50.620
Do you think they have anything

34:50.656 --> 34:52.054
     with the whipped cream
          on the side?

34:52.091 --> 34:57.594
Darling, I think they're playing

35:54.620 --> 35:55.986
I brought us a peppermint latte.

35:56.021 --> 35:56.753
            Thanks!

35:56.822 --> 35:58.688
   That's very merry of you.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.257
      This looks cheerful.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.458
      Did you do all this?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.059
    No, Lisa offered to help

36:03.128 --> 36:05.162
   in exchange for my graphic
        design know-how.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.664
   Apparently, I was recently
    described as incredible.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.698
         Lisa was here?

36:08.734 --> 36:09.799
             When?

36:09.835 --> 36:10.467
   Yesterday, while you were
        getting things

36:10.502 --> 36:11.434
    squared away with Jeff.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.269
       Are things squared
        away with Jeff?

36:12.304 --> 36:13.069
        Don't lie to me.

36:13.105 --> 36:14.371
   Are you guys still a match

36:14.406 --> 36:15.739
    'cause I need to update
   the report for Mrs. Lange.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.907
     All straightened out.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.341
We even went to a party together
          last night.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.876
  But don't worry, I made it
  Mingle All the Way official

36:19.912 --> 36:21.611
  so you can send the details
        to Mrs. Lange.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.880
 I think this plan is actually
      going to work, Ty.

36:23.916 --> 36:24.681
             Good.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.515
        That's a relief.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.516
      Uh, one more thing.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.584
      Dress more festive?

36:27.619 --> 36:29.019
     Okay, two more things.

36:29.054 --> 36:30.353
 I think you should write about
        your experience

36:30.389 --> 36:31.855
   with Jeff for the website.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.256
     What like a founder's
         testimonial?

36:33.292 --> 36:36.259
   Yeah, it'll be the piece
 de resistance for Mrs. Lange.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.595
Lisa's also teaching me French.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.763
              Hmm.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.501
Well, thanks so much for making
 time for you dad, sweetheart.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.735
        Yeah. Of course!

36:45.771 --> 36:47.003
 I would never miss our annual
         pre-Christmas

36:47.039 --> 36:48.672
      hot chocolate date.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.141
  Wish we kept up with more of
      our old traditions.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.375
    Mom's been even more...

36:52.411 --> 36:54.678
 intense than usual this year.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.547
    She only wants the best
           for you.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.683
    Here, I made some notes
          on the uh,

36:59.718 --> 37:01.885
   Mingle All the Way figures
       that you sent me.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.019
            [laughs]

37:03.055 --> 37:04.621
  You've done a terrific job,
          sweetheart.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.424
   I can tell how passionate
      you are about this.

37:07.459 --> 37:10.660
     Thanks daddy. I really
        appreciate that.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.329
   Well, I should get going.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.198
Meeting this boyfriend of yours?

37:15.234 --> 37:17.167
 I'll see ya in a couple days.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.768
       I love you, daddy.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.503
        I love you too.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.247
              Wow.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.415
    I didn't expect to see a
    restaurant moon lighting

37:32.484 --> 37:34.251
   as a gift-wrapping centre.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.120
      Technically, this is
        a Grayson event.

37:37.155 --> 37:39.489
    We like to support local
 organizations whenever we can.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.725
    It's part of an ongoing
      charitable program.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.628
I offered up the restaurant this
 year as a gift-wrapping venue.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.597
  Um, I think you meant to say
that I offered up the restaurant

37:47.633 --> 37:49.032
           this year.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.433
  It's nice to see you, Molly.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.901
  Good to see you too, Erika.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.403
So sis, where should we set up?

37:53.438 --> 37:55.138
  Molly is a Christmas novice

37:55.173 --> 37:56.606
    so maybe we should stick
         to the cards?

37:56.642 --> 37:58.108
           Oh no, no.

37:58.143 --> 38:01.478
 I might not be artistic, but I
  am amazing at gift wrapping.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.312
           Alrighty.

38:02.347 --> 38:03.079
             Mhmm.

38:03.115 --> 38:03.747
            Perfect.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.914
    Two seats, right there!

38:04.950 --> 38:05.749
           Excuse me.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.183
           After you.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.587
            Perfect.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.225
             Okay.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.595
    The kids are going to be
           so excited

38:18.630 --> 38:19.896
       when they get all
        of these gifts.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.064
             Sure.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.499
  Our company actually donated
        toys this year.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.134
  They're gonna be dropped off
   at the children's hospital

38:24.169 --> 38:25.168
       on Christmas Eve.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.870
        Oh, that's nice.

38:26.905 --> 38:31.808
 Um, for once, my dear brother
 here is being far too modest.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.109
       This is his event.

38:33.178 --> 38:37.314
 He organizes all of Grayson's
      charitable events.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.215
      This was your idea?

38:39.985 --> 38:41.318
              Oh.

38:41.353 --> 38:44.187
     So are you working on
     any commercials lately

38:44.222 --> 38:46.790
   or are you responsible for
 creating the concepts or what?

38:46.858 --> 38:49.025
 Unfortunately, I don't really
  get to spend a lot of time

38:50.896 --> 38:52.562
 I am kind of just a corporate
           suit now.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.830
              Oh.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.864
        Do you miss it?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.199
             Yeah.

38:56.234 --> 38:59.469
   But my ex, Ashley, she's
   the one who encouraged me

38:59.504 --> 39:00.837
      to make the switch.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.572
   She always thought there
   was more growth potential

39:02.607 --> 39:04.374
     on the business side.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.508
  The more I thought about it,

39:05.544 --> 39:07.610
   the more I kind of figured
         she was right.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.080
  So then, uh, your colleague,
             Brent,

39:10.148 --> 39:11.481
   he does all the designing?

39:11.516 --> 39:12.916
             Yeah.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.151
    Except he doesn't have a
   creative bone in his body.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.786
   He pawns off all his work
       on everyone else

39:16.822 --> 39:18.788
   and takes all the credit.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.090
 Mr. Grayson doesn't notice it?

39:20.158 --> 39:21.324
              Nah.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.060
    He sees Brent's persona
    as a viable team player.

39:24.096 --> 39:27.764
 But, if everything goes well,
  Mr. Grayson will be hearing

39:27.799 --> 39:29.799
   about me and my girlfriend

39:29.835 --> 39:31.067
    representing the company
            tonight.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.336
Oh yeah. I got your back, babe.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.271
           Thank you.

39:35.307 --> 39:38.041
      I guess I could use
     a fresh start in L.A.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.178
      Oh, before I forget.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.046
             Mhmm.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.582
 I made you a little something.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.052
   It's just a little gesture
          to apologize

39:49.087 --> 39:51.654
      for making you feel
   uncomfortable at the rink.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.762
         You drew this?

39:58.797 --> 40:01.664
             Yeah.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.266
           Thank you.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.937
You know you really didn't need
       to walk me home.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.373
   Well, it may not have been
          a real date

40:10.409 --> 40:12.809
but I am still a real gentleman.

40:12.844 --> 40:13.610
           Thank you.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.411
           Sometime.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.412
            [laughs]

40:16.715 --> 40:18.047
      So what does a woman
         like you need

40:18.116 --> 40:20.083
 Mingle All the Way for anyway?

40:20.118 --> 40:22.485
    I mean you're not so bad
         to be around.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.453
            [laughs]

40:23.488 --> 40:24.754
            Thanks.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.424
   I guess I just use it for
    the same reason as most

40:27.459 --> 40:28.958
   Mingle All the Way users.

40:28.994 --> 40:32.228
You know, I want someone to join
me for the holiday party circuit

40:32.264 --> 40:34.898
    but I don't want to have
    to worry about romance.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.599
       A real partner in
       networking crime.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.101
             Mhmm.

40:39.171 --> 40:42.705
 [whistles] That is a handsome
             fern.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.445
       Where did you get
      your Christmas tree?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.180
 I don't have a Christmas tree.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.514
      You don't have a...

40:51.550 --> 40:53.149
            [grunts]

40:53.185 --> 40:55.452
         Is grinchiness
     part of your heritage,

40:55.520 --> 40:58.254
   'cause I need to know what
   I'm fake-dating into here.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.923
              No.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.090
       When I was little

41:01.126 --> 41:03.526
  we did the whole traditional
        Christmas thing.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.062
   And I absolutely loved it.

41:06.097 --> 41:09.098
 But then I got to high school
      and my mom decided

41:09.134 --> 41:10.767
   that winter break would be
    the perfect time to take

41:10.802 --> 41:16.639
   a ski vacation instead of
   celebrating at home, so...

41:16.708 --> 41:17.941
         I don't know.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.375
   Every year has just gotten
     a little less special.

41:19.411 --> 41:21.811
      What's it like now?

41:21.880 --> 41:25.114
  My parents still go to Aspen
   every year for Christmas.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.816
Ever since their company started
       doing really well

41:26.852 --> 41:30.954
my mom just became hyper focused
   on impressing her clients.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.557
   That, and wondering about
     my dating prospects.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.558
          You'll see.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.526
           I'm sorry.

41:36.561 --> 41:37.927
 Christmas isn't fun, or merry

41:37.963 --> 41:41.564
    or really a true holiday
        for me anymore.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.633
    Couldn't take the heat.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.301
    So you got outta Santa's
            kitchen.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.838
            [laughs]

41:48.874 --> 41:51.374
  Come on, come on, let's go.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.080
            Come on.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.149
      <i> Okay, sounds good.</i>

42:00.185 --> 42:00.984
             <i> Bye.</i>

42:01.286 --> 42:02.752
 Well, Mrs. Lange sounds happy.

42:02.787 --> 42:03.720
 She's loving all the pictures

42:03.755 --> 42:05.455
        from your events
       so keep em coming.

42:05.490 --> 42:06.990
  And I told her I'd send her
    some more screen shots

42:07.058 --> 42:08.424
     of what it looks like
        on the app too.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.726
           Oh, good.

42:09.794 --> 42:10.760
  You know I almost slipped up
     yesterday about being

42:10.795 --> 42:12.395
 Mingle All the Way's founder.

42:12.430 --> 42:14.264
       I will be relieved
     when this is all over.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.298
        I bet you will.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.799
          [text alert]

42:16.835 --> 42:17.834
        That looks good.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.070
            [laughs]

42:21.139 --> 42:22.972
         What's funny?

42:23.008 --> 42:25.708
    Just confirming tonight.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.277
          [text alert]

42:31.550 --> 42:32.315
             Okay.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.449
   I'll see you after lunch.

42:33.485 --> 42:34.584
      Oh, and I started my
     founder's testimonial,

42:34.619 --> 42:35.718
 will you take a look at that?

42:35.754 --> 42:37.520
            Will do.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.457
 <i> Jeff recommended this place.</i>

42:41.526 --> 42:43.860
  He works around the corner,
     so, hope you like it.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.361
  Good. Things are still going
        well with Jeff?

42:45.397 --> 42:46.629
         He's so cute.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.331
     Yeah, hey Lisa listen,
   we're not actually dating.

42:48.366 --> 42:49.799
       We're just using
      Mingle All the Way.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.634
    I'm sorry, I should have
        told you sooner.

42:51.670 --> 42:52.869
      Oh, that's too bad.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.904
I thought you were giving dating
          a real shot.

42:54.973 --> 42:58.241
This, from Mingle All the Way's
         biggest fan?

42:58.276 --> 42:59.909
           Yes, I am.

           for now.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.649

       to start looking

43:06.685 --> 43:08.251
   for that special someone.

43:08.286 --> 43:09.419
      That's great, Lisa.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.054
  Well, any guy would be lucky
        to be with you.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.655
   I could say the same thing
           about you.

43:12.691 --> 43:15.191

              Um.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.463
    He would have a quality
          education,

43:20.532 --> 43:23.933
      analytical skills,
  great at time management...

43:23.969 --> 43:25.902
    Do you want him to have
    a fast typing speed too?

43:25.937 --> 43:26.869
    Ooh, that would be good.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.304

    manager or a boyfriend?

  are important to me too but,

43:33.345 --> 43:35.211
    what about personality?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.546
Okay, fine. What's on your list?

43:36.581 --> 43:37.880
             Hmmmm.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.515
    I'm looking for someone
    who can make me laugh.

43:39.551 --> 43:40.783
             Mhmm.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.418

       conversation with.

43:42.454 --> 43:43.786
              Hmm.

43:43.855 --> 43:47.757
  Most of all, I want someone
   who can see the real me.

43:47.792 --> 43:50.426
 Yeah but, aren't you concerned
   that you'll lose yourself

43:50.495 --> 43:52.295
      to the relationship?

43:52.330 --> 43:53.463
      That's what happened
       with me and Evan.

43:53.498 --> 43:54.931
   That's why it had to end.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.000
  I don't think that happens
when you find the right person.

43:57.035 --> 43:58.034

43:58.103 --> 43:59.435

44:16.488 --> 44:18.154
    I just finished shopping
        for mom and dad.

44:18.189 --> 44:20.757
   I had to buy all my gifts
       online this year.

44:20.792 --> 44:22.225
  Enough with the small talk.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.693
    Are you going to tell me
     about your boyfriend?

44:23.762 --> 44:24.961
  It's not really a big deal.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.262
        <i> Not a big deal?</i>

44:26.297 --> 44:27.864
      I want the details!

44:29.367 --> 44:31.567
 You know what, uh, I will have
       to tell you later

44:31.603 --> 44:32.702
 'cause I am going to an event

44:32.737 --> 44:33.903

          is hosting.

     You've been following
      her career forever.

44:37.108 --> 44:41.611
    But, okay, just give me
         something...

44:41.646 --> 44:43.146
You'll get to meet him tomorrow.

      rather joyful today.

         sit me today.

45:06.404 --> 45:07.537
   Yes, it is more than okay.

45:07.572 --> 45:08.938
   I'm so excited to see you!

45:08.973 --> 45:09.939
  He told me you were coming.

45:09.974 --> 45:10.907
      We're going to have
         a lot of fun.

45:10.942 --> 45:13.142
      Have you ladies met
        Molly Hoffman?

45:13.178 --> 45:14.610
 No, hi, I'm new to the group.

45:14.646 --> 45:16.446
        Uh, Ms. Rowlands
        it is an honour.

45:16.481 --> 45:17.613
              Hi.

45:17.682 --> 45:19.182
 Your book inspired me to start
          my company.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.683
     Molly is going places.

45:20.752 --> 45:21.751

45:21.786 --> 45:23.486
  I suggest you take her card.

45:23.521 --> 45:25.321
     Do you want an apron?

45:25.356 --> 45:27.957
  I actually don't think that
you want me anywhere near icing,

45:28.026 --> 45:29.058
        if that's okay.

45:29.094 --> 45:30.560
  That is certainly not okay.

45:30.628 --> 45:32.095
     You are our teammate.

45:32.130 --> 45:33.896
   And our team plans to win.

    Hi Tyler, I didn't know
       you were coming.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.412
         Neither did I.

45:49.447 --> 45:52.982
 Kevin is sick so I asked Tyler
to join me as my baking partner.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.384
  And you know how much I love
      competitive baking.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.154
 You love competitive anything.

       is very talented.

         baking shows.

       if we don't win,

46:18.309 --> 46:20.877
       you are a huge hit
        with this crowd.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.047

        lunch together.

 First of all, we're definitely
         going to win.

    anything about your app.

     it's called "Book It".

     would just bore you.

  investors so I don't have to

47:00.852 --> 47:03.452
   close up shop and go back
    to work for my parents.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.054
     Would that be so bad?

47:05.089 --> 47:06.689
  It's just my whole life my
 parents have really wanted me

47:06.758 --> 47:08.291

47:08.326 --> 47:10.827

     that provides a 401K.

50:04.268 --> 50:05.534

50:05.570 --> 50:07.169

50:07.205 --> 50:08.604
     Should we play a game?

50:08.639 --> 50:10.339
     Well, typically we do
       our gift exchange

50:10.375 --> 50:11.741
     prior to sitting down
          for dinner.

50:11.809 --> 50:13.209
           Oh great.

50:13.244 --> 50:15.044
     Molly should go first.

50:18.149 --> 50:19.749
     This is for you, sir.

50:22.687 --> 50:23.652
           Thank you.

50:26.891 --> 50:28.824
 You left that one in the car.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.127
       Open the present.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.697
    Oh, I can't believe it.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.565
How did you find a replacement?

50:36.601 --> 50:38.300
     This is so wonderful!

50:38.336 --> 50:40.369
     Look... Look at that!

50:40.405 --> 50:43.672
       Well, I'm so glad
    that you love it, daddy.

50:43.708 --> 50:46.542
  Um, Jeff actually helped me
        with that one.

50:46.611 --> 50:48.044
        Oh, let me see.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.045
          Look Harris.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.846
 Yeah, it's the one that broke.

50:53.951 --> 50:56.385
    But what about Riley and
  starting your new tradition?

50:56.421 --> 50:57.920
     I just figured we'd go
          to the store

50:57.955 --> 51:00.790
     and pick out something
         new together.

51:00.858 --> 51:03.159
I wanted you to have the angel.

51:03.928 --> 51:05.928
       Okay. Who's next?

51:05.963 --> 51:07.830
          Um, Harris.

51:07.865 --> 51:10.733
      This one is for you.

51:10.768 --> 51:11.634
          Here you go.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.302
             Okay.

51:15.473 --> 51:17.306
     It's a fitness monitor
       so you can sync it

51:17.341 --> 51:19.375
    to an app on your phone.

51:19.410 --> 51:20.476
         Oh, thank you.

51:20.511 --> 51:21.310
             Yeah.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.746
      Kids and these apps,
            my gosh.

51:23.781 --> 51:26.082
I mean, in our day the only apps
     we were talking about

51:26.117 --> 51:28.317
was bruschetta and cheese puffs.

51:28.352 --> 51:29.518
       [everyone laughs]

51:29.554 --> 51:31.620
        Well, I'll never
        understand this.

51:31.656 --> 51:32.621
    I... I... I just don't.

51:32.657 --> 51:34.223
  I don't understand all this.

51:34.258 --> 51:35.524
  No, how could you understand
            it mom,

51:35.560 --> 51:37.927
you've never asked me about it.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.495
       Molly, seriously.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.230
    It's time to just let go
        of this project

51:41.265 --> 51:42.998
   and come back to Hoffman.

51:43.067 --> 51:44.233
       Veronica not now.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.534
         We're supposed
       to be celebrating.

51:45.570 --> 51:47.103
    She needs to hear this.

51:47.138 --> 51:49.939
 It's just too risky to go out
     on her own like this.

51:49.974 --> 51:51.474
     Yeah well, I'd rather
          take a shot

51:51.509 --> 51:54.009
 than risk being an accountant.

51:54.078 --> 51:55.778
  And what is wrong with being
         an accountant?

51:55.847 --> 51:57.480
            Nothing.

51:57.515 --> 51:59.815
     Look mom, it's perfect
         for you, okay?

51:59.884 --> 52:03.385
  And, it's just, I don't have
       a passion for it.

52:03.454 --> 52:06.255
  And, mom I'm sorry if that
 messes up your big life plan,

52:06.290 --> 52:08.257
       but it's my life
     that you're planning.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.759
Molly your Mother just wants you
to be mindful about the future.

52:10.795 --> 52:12.595
    No, she wants to control
           my future.

52:12.630 --> 52:13.762

52:30.481 --> 52:31.480
            Jeffrey.

52:31.516 --> 52:33.149
 I apologize for the dramatics.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.416
       She'll calm down.

52:34.452 --> 52:36.185
         Mrs. Hoffman,

52:36.220 --> 52:38.988
don't you see what an incredible
         woman she is?

52:39.056 --> 52:40.055
        Of course I do.

52:40.091 --> 52:42.825
     She is just not acting
        with any sense.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.561
   All she wants is to create
        her own success.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.096
        Make you proud.

52:47.165 --> 52:50.466
 Young man I don't think I need
an education on my own daughter.

52:50.501 --> 52:54.537
    Forgive me, I disagree.

52:54.605 --> 52:58.974
 She is thoughtful, dedicated,
         intelligent.

52:59.010 --> 53:01.143
       She's even funny.

53:01.179 --> 53:02.478
 When you give her the chance.

53:02.547 --> 53:05.848
      And maybe you don't
        appreciate her.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.950

53:14.959 --> 53:16.192

          my promise

53:35.546 --> 53:39.248
          Ah. Alright.

53:39.283 --> 53:45.588
     So tell me about this
        Evan character.

53:45.623 --> 53:47.223
   Why did you guys breakup?

53:47.258 --> 53:48.824
      Is he even clutzier
         than you are?

53:48.859 --> 53:49.825
            [laughs]

53:49.860 --> 53:52.094
          We both know
      that's not possible.

53:52.163 --> 53:54.997
     No, he was a nice guy.

53:55.032 --> 53:58.200
  I just, I think, the future
         he envisioned

53:58.236 --> 54:00.202
   only included his dreams.

54:00.271 --> 54:02.438
He never really supported mine.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.240
           And then?

54:04.308 --> 54:07.576
     And then we graduated
       and parted ways.

54:07.612 --> 54:10.346
 I guess as far as breakups go,
    it was pretty painless.

54:10.381 --> 54:12.648
     Maybe your heart just
         wasn't in it.

54:12.683 --> 54:16.819
     Yeah. Probably right.

54:16.854 --> 54:19.788
That, and I promised myself that
  I would never lose sight of

54:19.857 --> 54:22.958

   distracted by a boyfriend.

59:25.462 --> 59:27.729
  when I followed her advice
and pursued the corporate track

59:27.765 --> 59:30.065
     she said I didn't have
      enough time for her

59:30.134 --> 59:33.535
  which is pretty ironic, huh?

59:33.571 --> 59:35.370
             Yeah.

59:35.406 --> 59:36.772
             Sorry.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.907
    The breakup was a shock.

59:38.943 --> 59:41.176
 I'm over it now but sometimes
       I do miss having

59:41.211 --> 59:43.312
      that person around
    who always had my back.

59:43.347 --> 59:47.382
 Yeah, I don't... I don't think
      I've ever had that.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.268
  My compliments to the Jeff.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:07.302
           [chuckles]

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.939
     Now it's time to make
         like a tree.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:11.907
           And leave?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.075
           And leave.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.109
   I think you mean decorate
       the tree, right?

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.477
          Yeah, right.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:17.579
            [laughs]

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:20.816
             Okay.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.218
           [chuckles]

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:26.688
              Wow.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:28.323
       You bought me all
       these ornaments?

01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:29.691
    No, I did not buy these.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.259
         These are from
       my personal stash.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:34.429
     I have been collecting
        these for years.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.698
    Along with snow globes.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:39.434
    I get a new one in every
         city I visit.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.371
  You are one of a kind, sir.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:43.772
       Yeah, I know what
       you're thinking.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.974
   It's lame for a grown man
     to love snow globes.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.844
 Thinking it, yes, but I wasn't
   going to say it out loud.

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:53.081
There is nothing wrong with lame
  hobbies because I, for one,

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.883
   belong to a knitting club.

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:55.851
            [laughs]

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:57.319
           It's true.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:01:00.789
    My mom gave me my first
  snow globe when I was a kid.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.359
 Keeping the tradition helps me
         remember her.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:05.494
      I guess that's part
         of the reason

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.562
  I love tseason so much.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:11.099
 My family always made it feel
          so special.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:13.669
      That's really sweet.

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:15.437
  What about Erika and Riley,
 aren't they going to miss you

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:17.572
     when you move to L.A?

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:20.942
      I'm sure they will.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.846
Let's circle back to this whole
        knitting club-

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:26.648
            [crash]

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.890
  My knight in shining tinsel.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.061
         That was a...

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:40.062
        was a close one.

01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:44.099
             Yeah.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.268
           Close one.

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:54.443
           [knocking]

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:55.510
             Hello?

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:56.344
              Mom?

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.014
  Is this a good time to talk?

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.849
           Yeah, hey.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.317
    What are you doing here?

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:04.286
   Came to see my daughter's
            office.

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:06.755
              Oh.

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:11.426
      It's very charming.

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.894
   Are you making fun of me?

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.129
              No!

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:15.964
            I'm not.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:18.333
           I'm sorry.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:19.968
   Your, your Jeffrey gave me
      a good dressing down

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:21.269
    about my attitude and...

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:22.804
     Well, I hope he didn't
          offend you.

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:26.108
He's just, he's very encouraging
       about my project.

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:28.310
        Well, I'm glad.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:29.911
  It's high time I came to see
    what Mingle All the Way

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.113
         was all about.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:32.314
            [laughs]

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.216
              Wow.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.985
   You just said "Mingle All
   the Way" without gagging.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.420
    Well, Michelle showed me
          how it works

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:40.889
  and it's very professional,
         it really is.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:46.027
 Well, we're still hoping for
 a bigger launch, but, we try.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:50.565
  Molly, I have no doubt that
 you are going to be a success

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.235
 at whatever you choose to do.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:57.072
     And I'm proud of you.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.974
      You have a funny way
         of showing it.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.642
  I wanted to push you because
         I didn't think

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.110
       you were thinking
        things through,

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.879
    striking out on your own
           like that.

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:07.282
   But obviously I was wrong.

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.817
     But you're never hard
         on Michelle.

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:10.652
       Michelle is a very
       different person.

01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:12.220
 She needs constant validation

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.689
     but you've always been
         so confident.

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:17.092
   I just knew you could take
         more pressure.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.394
            [sighs]

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.563
    Well, to be honest mom,

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.632
     I just act confidently
           around you

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:28.904
       because I'm trying
        to impress you.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.039
 Did it ever occur to you that
   I wanted you to come back

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:35.310
 to work with me because I just
    like having you around?

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.748
    Listen, daddy and I had
            a talk

01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:42.717
   and we've decided this is
    our last year in Aspen.

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:45.420
   We'd like to start having
  Christmas as a family again.

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:47.756
  With all the old traditions.

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.558
  Yeah, I... I would like that
             a lot.

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:52.627
  And I know you two have your
 Father-Daughter time together,

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:55.230
    and I was thinking maybe
           you and I

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:58.867
       could maybe start
     our own one-on-one...

01:03:58.902 --> 01:03:59.801
             Thing?

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:00.969
       Activity... thing?

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.272
 Yeah, that would be fantastic,
              mom.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:08.643
Now these didn't turn out quite
like they looked on the internet

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.646
  but I thought we could have
           a treat.

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:13.748
  I think they look delicious.

01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:16.384
 And, Jeffrey's famous eggnog.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.552
            [laughs]

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.387
 It's actually shockingly good.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.155
             Yeah?

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:21.723
             Yeah.

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:24.025
   I'm really glad you came.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:25.827
            Me too.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:31.299
   Hey, um, how did you know
 that dad was the man for you?

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:38.406
             Well.

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:43.511
   Do you think you're going
  to stay in touch with Molly?

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:47.649
    I mean we didn't exactly
     discuss it or anything

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.752
 but sure I don't see why not.

01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:52.254
  I am going to have to check
        on her progress

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.422
with that must-watch movie list
          I made her.

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.690
            Uh-huh.

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:56.958
   And I'm going to send her
     some simple recipes.

01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:59.427
     That girl is hopeless
        in the kitchen.

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:00.762
             Okay.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:05.533
 Can you honestly say you don't
     have feelings for her?

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:09.004
       I feel that she is
         an intelligent

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.305
    and interesting person.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.274
 If you're asking romantically,
            I just-

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:14.376
 Okay. I have to tell you this.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:17.846
  Your face never lit up when
    you talked about Ashley

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:22.217
 the way it does when you talk
         about Molly.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.453
 Are you sure that Ashley broke
          your heart?

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:30.959
    I mean isn't it possible
  she just wounded your pride?

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:34.195
  It's time you stopped hiding
        behind your work

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:37.933
    and get back out there.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:40.168
 What difference does it make?

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:42.704
 Molly isn't interested in me.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:44.973
        Are you so sure?

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:48.009
        I mean isn't it
       worth finding out?

      Well, you seem a lot
          less anxious

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.999
 than the last time we visited
          your folks.

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:12.434
             Yeah.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:15.236
 Well, I had a really wonderful
   conversation with my mom.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.371
           Thank you.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.939
             Here.

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:20.041
   Um, by the way, I wanted
 to thank you for standing up-

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:22.510
 I have no idea what you mean.

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:25.447
    But whatever your mother
        may have heard,

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.182
        it was all true.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.285
      Molly, sweetheart,
      you look wonderful.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:31.252
         Thanks, daddy.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:31.987
            Jeffrey.

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:32.721
              Sir.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:33.455
        Nice to see you.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.622
            Hi mom.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:36.057
     Sweetheart, thank you
      so much for coming.

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:37.058
             Yeah.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:37.659
    It wouldn't be the same
         without you.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:38.760
        Yeah, of course.

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:40.895
         Either of you.

01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:41.696
             Molly!

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:42.964
              Hi!

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.732
        You look great.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.799
           Thank you!

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.134
            Harris.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:46.835
     Good to see you again.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:47.802
             Yeah.

      I'm going to go look
       at the song book.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.161
      Great work landing
      Swift Technologies.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:53.995
        Thank you, sir.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.063
         Is Molly okay?

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.331
   For sure. She's fine, sir.

01:13:57.367 --> 01:13:58.332
              Hey.

01:13:58.368 --> 01:13:59.333
      Tell... tell us more
          about Molly.

01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:01.035
    We barely know anything
          about her.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:02.670
 Uh, she's a tech entrepreneur.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:04.639
       Her scheduling app
     is currently being uh,

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:05.973
      capitalized by Lange
          Enterprises.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:07.442
          Scheduling?

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:10.545
  That's an interesting way to
  describe Mingle All the Way.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:11.813
          Mingle what?

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.614
 Oh, it's a tool that very busy
       guys like Jeff use

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:15.716
   to rustle up a girlfriend.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.251
 Brent what are you driving at?

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.554
 It's very fascinating sir, in
fact I was just reading Molly's,

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.689
 uh, founder's testimonial on
the Mingle All the Way website-

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:22.290
             What?

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:22.990
             Brent.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.192
        Uh, here we go.

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.893
"This Christmas, it's networking
          success one,

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.528
     "dating anxiety zero"

         Please don't.

        Can I see that?

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:42.310
             Yeah.

     This was posted today?

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:02.129
   So, this was all for show,
            Jeffrey?

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:06.167
     This is, uh, extremely
         disappointing.

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:08.903
   Yes sir, it certainly is.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:10.571
          I should go.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.584
  So, you were just using me?

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.819
 We were both using each other.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:26.120
   That's what we agreed to.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.222
             Maybe.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:32.493
   But I thought we developed
       a real connection.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:35.897
    Jeff, we've been lying
   to Mr. Grayson all along.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.366
             Yeah.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:41.736
    But I never lied to you.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.338
        Good luck with
   your presentation, Molly.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:56.884
        [phone ringing]

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.818
        Hello, darling.

01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:59.654
        Merry Christmas.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:00.821
     Daddy and I are having
          a wonderful-

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:01.856
             <i> Mom.</i>

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:04.992
    I messed everything up.

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:05.960
       <i> What do you mean?</i>

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.128
      Is it about the app?

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:08.396
     'Cause if Helen Lange
     isn't coming through

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:09.931
  with that investment, honey,
       we can talk about-

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:11.499
       No. It's not that.

01:16:11.568 --> 01:16:13.100
           It's Jeff.

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:15.202
  <i> Listen mom, I've been lying</i>
 <i> to you about our relationship</i>

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.572
  and you don't deserve that.

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:24.545
    Merry Christmas, kiddo.

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:25.413
              Wow!

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:26.480
       Look at that doll!

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:27.515
       Thanks Uncle Jeff.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.450
          I love her!

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:32.053
     Molly helped me choose
          everything.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:33.988
    Well, Riley you're going
      to have to make sure

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:35.990
      that you call Molly
         to thank her.

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:38.859
    That won't be necessary.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.095
       You're in a mood.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.631
    Aren't you going to some
    big gala with her later?

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:45.132
          Not anymore.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.101
 I'm not feeling very festive.

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.970
     I'm gonna take a walk.
         Clear my head.

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.205
   You forgot your last gift!

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.007
 Molly dropped it off for you.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.176
   She wanted you to have it
      Christmas morning.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.825
       Oh, that's sweet.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.370
          Mr. Grayson!

01:17:24.607 --> 01:17:25.940
   What brings you out today?

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:27.174
     Merry Christmas, sir.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.110
   I'm on my way to my son's.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.245
      The real question is
    what are you doing here?

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.482
  You rushed out of my house
before we had a chance to talk.

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:36.617
  Mr. Grayson, I am so sorry.

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:39.453
  Well, that stunt that Brent
   performed was despicable.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:41.422
    A true Grayson teammate
  doesn't spite his colleagues

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:42.690
        in that manner.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.792
  Believe you me, Brent and I
        had some words.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.962
  Everything he said was true.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:49.397
     I haven't been honest
         with you, sir

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:53.134
    and it's time I stopped
          pretending.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:56.404
 Jeffrey, I know a man in love
        when I see it.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:58.773
  And I'm not so sure you were
       pretending at all.

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:00.841
    Look, you don't need a
   girlfriend to prove to me

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.277
    you know how to commit.

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:05.613
  I just needed to be certain
    that you were dedicated

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.181
     to an executive role.

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:10.384
 And if you're willing to work
this hard just for the position,

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.953
     well then, you've got
         me convinced.

01:18:12.989 --> 01:18:14.422
   The L.A. office is yours.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.023
        If you want it.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.928
               ♪

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:23.064
 Okay, if she turns around I'm
going to have to say something,

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.665
     so, what should I say?

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:25.733
      Talk about the food.

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:26.734
      What about the food?

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:27.902
       The hors d'oeuvres
         are delicious.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.170
  That's great. I'll use that.
         That's great.

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:30.871
         Where is she?

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:37.745
 Hey, uh, where have you been?

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.046
      We've been waiting.

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:40.381
      Cut her some slack.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.482
  Don't worry about being late
     you're right on time.

01:18:41.517 --> 01:18:43.084
       Jeff isn't coming.

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.719
      I ruined everything.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.787
     What... what happened?

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:50.725
     He read my testimonial
    and found out the truth.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.859
        He hates me now.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.627
       Molly, I'm sorry.

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:54.595
    I... I wasn't thinking.

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:56.163
   No, it wasn't your fault.

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:59.633
 I just, I don't know what I'm
going to say to Mrs. Lange. I...

01:18:59.669 --> 01:19:01.202
     She is going to think
        I'm a failure.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.137
   You know, forget about her
         for a second.

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:04.705
       Yeah. How are you?

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.140
  What, no, it doesn't matter
            I just,

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:09.009
 I can't face her yet, I, I...
  what am I supposed to say?

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:10.745
        I can't face her
    until I know what to do.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.113
         Okay, come on.

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:19.320
     Listen to me, you are
        Molly Hoffman-

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.288
 Creator of Mingle All the Way.

01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:23.791
        You've got this.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.659
         Wish me luck.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:33.033
    Excuse me for a moment.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.535
             Molly!

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.971
 I have been trying to have a
 word with you all night long.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:41.776
  So where is your match that
 I've heard so very much about?

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:45.746
 Well, the truth is Mrs. Lange,
         the truth is-

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:48.616
      The truth is, I was
         running late.

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:49.950
         Jeff Scanlon.

01:19:49.986 --> 01:19:52.186
 It is a pleasure to meet you,
          Mrs. Lange.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.320
           Likewise.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.822
   I know you're considering
         an investment

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:55.956
     in Mingle All the Way,

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:59.460
  but I think you should stop
        considering it.

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:00.427
              Oh?

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.364
I can't think of a better idea.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.300
I know I don't regret signing up
            for it.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:09.203
  So you feel that your match
with Ms. Hoffman was a success,

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:11.539
  in spite of your reluctance
    to have a relationship?

01:20:11.607 --> 01:20:15.543
   Meeting Molly was the most
        successful thing

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:18.245
   to happen to me all year.

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:21.649
  It taught me about the kind
  of woman I should be with.

01:20:21.684 --> 01:20:24.585
     Do I detect something
    between the two of you?

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:28.489
Something more than a functional
          arrangement?

01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:32.660
              No.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.163
  We used Mingle All the Way
  exactly as it was intended.

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:36.864
        There was never-

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:38.666
        Yes, Mrs. Lange.

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.167
           There is.

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:41.702
 I'm sorry for misleading you,

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:45.806
but I've developed real feelings
           for Jeff.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:47.007
             Ma'am.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:49.543
    Sorry, there is someone
    you really need to meet.

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:50.711
<i>Oh, I'll be right there Connor.</i>

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:52.613
          <i> Thank you.</i>

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:54.582
 I'm sorry. Will you excuse me
           a moment?

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:01.121
 I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:03.190
     It was worth the wait.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:05.559
       So what happened
       with Mr. Grayson?

01:21:05.595 --> 01:21:07.194
         Was he angry?

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:10.531
          Yes, he was.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:13.067
         But, at Brent.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:14.735
  He offered me the promotion.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:17.705
  Wow! That's... that's great!

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:18.806
        Congratulations-

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:20.641
       I didn't take it.

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.511
 I don't need L.A. to be happy.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:28.349
 Everything I need to be happy
        is right here.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:31.418
I don't want to be that far away
          from Riley.

01:21:31.454 --> 01:21:34.488
          Or from you.

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:39.693
     So, what are you going
         to do instead?

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:43.530
 I told Mr. Grayson that I want
    to get back to designing

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:46.300
   and he is going to let me
    oversee the department.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.903
    I am staying right here
        in Cedar Falls.

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:51.972
  [laughs] That is fantastic!

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:53.908
              So?

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:54.708
              Hey.

01:21:54.744 --> 01:21:56.710
      Sorry to interrupt.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:57.611
       What did she say?

01:21:57.647 --> 01:21:59.914
  Oh, I...I haven't heard yet.

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:03.651
  Molly, I've put some thought
            into it

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:07.187
  and I think that the concept
       for your app is...

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:13.560
          Sensational!

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.162
      And it's even better
     when you get something

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:17.431
   more out of the experience
       than you expected.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:18.532
             It is?

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:20.501
         That's great!

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:24.071
   So I am very proud to say

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.640
      welcome to the Lange
      Enterprises Family.

01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:27.942
       Thank you so much!

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:29.209
        Way to go Molly!

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:31.645
  Well, shall we go celebrate
         with a toast.

01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:33.080
           We shall.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:43.958
    Merry Christmas, Molly.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:45.693
     Merry Christmas, Jeff.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:49.296
     And just to be honest,

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:54.068
    I have completely fallen
            for you.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:57.304
     That is good to hear,
        Molly Hoffman.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:02.276
     Because as it stands,
     I feel the same way.

    Thought you'd never ask.

01:23:18.394 --> 01:23:20.260
       What are you doing
         for New Years?

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:23.464
Well, let me check my schedule.
