00:15.133 --> 00:16.734
Hello there. Today--

00:16.800 --> 00:19.867
Elmo loves how you said that,
Grover. "Hello there."

00:19.934 --> 00:21.066
Oh. How kind
of you to say.

00:21.133 --> 00:22.066
Ehh.

00:22.133 --> 00:23.367
Today,
"Sesame Street" is--

00:23.433 --> 00:25.133
And, you know,
Grover's fur is really nice,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.133
really silky.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.333
That is kind, also,

00:27.400 --> 00:28.533
but I have
to finish here, Elmo.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.734
Oh. Well, go ahead.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.533
You know,
you're very good at this.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.066
Today, "Sesame Street"
is all about...

00:36.133 --> 00:38.700
All a--
Oh, I forget.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.066
Kindness, Grover.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.734
Oh, yes, kindness.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.200
Thank you. That was
very kind of you.

00:43.266 --> 00:45.100

01:19.166 --> 01:20.300
on her back...

01:20.367 --> 01:22.834
to help her bird friend
build a nest."

01:22.900 --> 01:24.333
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Heh heh!

01:24.400 --> 01:26.967
Oh! Hey there!
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.367
- Hi!
- Yeah.

01:28.433 --> 01:30.967
We're reading a book
called "Kind Kalima."

01:31.033 --> 01:32.934
Yeah.
She's a hippopotamus.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.333
Yeah.
Look at this.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.633
She is a very kind hippo.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.433
She's kind
to all the other animals

01:37.500 --> 01:39.033
in the forest
like that little birdie
up there.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.767
Yeah, and--and we want
to be kind, too.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.133
Hey! What's all the racket
out here?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.867
Can't a grouch
who's feeling sick

01:45.934 --> 01:47.266
get a little peace
and quiet?

01:47.333 --> 01:50.367
Scram! Go away!

01:51.900 --> 01:54.133
Well, going away
doesn't really seem

01:54.200 --> 01:55.867
like a way to be kind.

01:55.934 --> 01:58.266
Yeah. You know,
Kind--Kind Kalima says,

01:58.333 --> 02:00.133
"being kind means
doing nice things

02:00.200 --> 02:01.367
for other people,"

02:01.433 --> 02:03.166
you know, to show them
that you care about them.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.600
Well, then there's got
to be something kind

02:05.667 --> 02:08.233
we can do for Mr. Oscar
instead of going away.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.467
Yeah. You know what?
That's a good idea.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.000
- Let's ask him. Come on.
- OK.

02:11.066 --> 02:12.333
- Oscar!
- Oscar!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.667
Oh, Oscar!

02:13.734 --> 02:15.333
What?!

02:15.400 --> 02:18.900
Ever get the feeling
you're in for a very long day?

02:18.967 --> 02:21.100
Don't you two know
you shouldn't go around yelling

02:21.166 --> 02:23.400
at a guy's trash can
when he's feeling sick?

02:23.467 --> 02:25.467
Who brought you up

02:25.533 --> 02:26.533
- Yeah!
- No.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.033
Well, monsters.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.400
Ugh. Figures.

02:29.467 --> 02:30.900
Baby Bear:
Uh, we are trying
to find out

02:30.967 --> 02:33.000
how we can be kind
to you, Oscar.

02:33.066 --> 02:36.266
Oh. Oh, you want
to be kind to me, huh?

02:36.333 --> 02:38.367
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's easy.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.834
Leave me alone
and go somewhere else!

02:40.900 --> 02:42.500
Oh, brother...

02:42.567 --> 02:44.500
This cold must be worse
than I thought.

02:44.567 --> 02:47.033
I'm feeling really strange.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.200
Ugh.

02:49.266 --> 02:51.467
But what do we do now,
Baby Bear?

02:51.533 --> 02:55.800
Uh, well, we could,
um... We-- I don't know.

02:55.867 --> 02:58.033
I do not know, uh,
what we can do.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.934
You know, Kind Kalima helps
other forest animals,

03:01.000 --> 03:02.600
but, um, I don't see

03:02.667 --> 03:04.433
any other forest animals
around here.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.900
No. I wish someone
like Kind Kalima were here

03:06.967 --> 03:08.233
to show us how
to be kind.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.834
- Yeah.
!

03:09.900 --> 03:11.333
What did you just say?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.433
- Uh...
- Uh, I, um--

03:13.500 --> 03:14.967
Well, um,
we were just,
um, discussing--

03:15.033 --> 03:18.400
Hang on. I'm coming out.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.934
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!

03:20.000 --> 03:22.133
So you want
to to be kind, do you?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.200
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:24.266 --> 03:26.633
Yeah? Well,
I got news for you.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.066
Being kind's not hard to do.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.867
Go ahead and give it a try.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.834
Say to yourself,
"what would I like

03:32.900 --> 03:34.934
if I was the other guy?"

03:36.433 --> 03:40.834
Uh, oh. Let's see if I can
make it easier for you.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.900
Oh, boy. Ha!

03:44.333 --> 03:46.300
If you saw a friend
coming toward you,

03:46.367 --> 03:48.133
what would you want
them to do?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.600
Wouldn't it be nice
to hear them say,

03:50.667 --> 03:53.000
"Good morning, Elmo.
How are you?"

03:53.066 --> 03:56.033
Hubba! Oscar...

03:57.200 --> 03:58.333
Is that you?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.567
Yep, it's me.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.467
Oh. Well, um, hello.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.400
Oh, wait. Uh,
Elmo was playing catch,

04:03.467 --> 04:05.500
and then that happened.

04:05.567 --> 04:08.033
Hmm? Oh!
Stuck in a tree.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.767
- Stuck in a tree.
- Yep.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.166
That's no problem.
Leave it to me!

04:12.233 --> 04:13.367
Heh heh.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
Ugh. See this, boys?

04:18.867 --> 04:20.834
Just keep it in mind.

04:20.900 --> 04:23.233

Oscar, stop that.

06:25.000 --> 06:25.967
- We are grouches!

06:26.033 --> 06:27.433
We don't like hugs.

Oh. Fair enough.

Oh, something is

06:40.800 --> 06:43.100
Hmm.
Better go find out what.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.834
Huh.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.000
There's lots of ways
to show kindness.

06:47.066 --> 06:48.367
Let's all give it a try.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.767
Just say to yourself,
"What would I like

06:50.834 --> 06:52.233
if I was the other guy?"

06:52.300 --> 06:53.867
- That's a girl.

06:53.934 --> 06:55.367
Rudy: Um, Mr. Oscar?

06:55.433 --> 06:56.900
Yeah, Rudy?

06:56.967 --> 06:58.934
Um, what do
you mean, um,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.200
"if I was the other guy?"

07:01.266 --> 07:03.333
Well, for instance,
do you want people

07:03.400 --> 07:05.166
to be mean to you,

07:05.233 --> 07:06.400
or would you like them
to be kind

07:06.467 --> 07:08.066
and friendly, too?

07:09.333 --> 07:11.233
Um, kind and friendly?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.233
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.333
You know, we like it

07:13.400 --> 07:14.433
- when people are kind to us,
- Yeah.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.600
so we should be kind to them.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.700
- That's right.
- Right!

07:16.767 --> 07:18.700
Just look around,
and you'll find

07:18.767 --> 07:21.033
there's lots of ways
to be kind.

07:21.100 --> 07:25.500
Hey. Hang on, boys.
Watch the master in action.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.367

07:34.433 --> 07:36.900

to practice my duet,

07:36.967 --> 07:39.734
but there's no one
to dance with me.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.900
See that?
If you see a person
who needs help,

07:42.967 --> 07:44.133
don't turn around and run.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.500
Here's your chance
to be kind to a friend,

07:46.567 --> 07:47.767

08:35.633 --> 08:37.300
Yes. I looked it up

08:37.367 --> 08:40.000
in this grouch medical book.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.567
You know how
when you get sick,

08:41.633 --> 08:43.500
you feel kind of grouchy?

08:43.567 --> 08:44.967
Right.

08:45.033 --> 08:48.500
Well, when grouches get sick
with kinditis,

08:48.567 --> 08:51.033
they start feeling all...

08:51.100 --> 08:52.800
kind inside!

08:54.967 --> 08:56.900
Oh, so that's
what's happening.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.967
Oscar has kinditis!

08:59.033 --> 09:02.800
Yes. Was he talking
in rhymes?

09:02.867 --> 09:03.967
Sometimes.

09:04.033 --> 09:07.800
Oh, oh! It is worse
than I thought.

09:07.867 --> 09:09.467
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

09:09.533 --> 09:11.400
Uh, over there.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.000
He's helping
Mrs. Crustworthy.

09:13.066 --> 09:15.800
Oh! Oh,
come on. Hurry!

09:15.867 --> 09:20.100
Oh! What a lovely
tea party, boys.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.700
Finger sandwich,
anyone?

09:21.767 --> 09:23.800
I made them myself.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.233
Oh, how delightful!

09:26.300 --> 09:28.700
- Oh, what a lovely selection.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.767
- Oh, Oskie, Oskie!

09:30.834 --> 09:31.900
There you are.

09:31.967 --> 09:33.367
Are you feeling OK?

09:33.433 --> 09:35.100
Yeah. I'm feeling great!

09:35.166 --> 09:37.900
Doing kind things
makes me feel good inside.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.367
But, Oskie, you're a grouch.

09:40.433 --> 09:43.300
You don't like
feeling good inside.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.734
Oh, I guess I am feeling
a little pooped

09:46.800 --> 09:48.600
now that you mention it. Ugh.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.934
Well, let me take you
back to the trash can.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.934
I'll make you a nice, hot bowl
of oatmeal and sardines.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.066
Aww. You're so kind.
Time for hugs!

09:59.133 --> 10:02.066
- No!
- Ha ha ha! Aww.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.767
I suppose there's no chance

10:03.834 --> 10:05.066
he'll stay like this, right?

10:05.133 --> 10:06.100
Grundgetta:
Aw, don't worry.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.967
It's just a 24-hour bug.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.166
He'll be back
to his old, grouchy self

10:10.233 --> 10:11.867
before you know it.

10:11.934 --> 10:12.867
I had a feeling
she'd say that.

10:12.934 --> 10:13.967
Grundgetta: Stop that!

10:14.033 --> 10:15.033
Grouch:
Let's go to the laundromat

10:15.100 --> 10:16.066
and clean some clothes.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.133
Grundgetta: Get off me!

10:17.200 --> 10:18.533
Young man,

10:18.600 --> 10:22.300
that kind, rumpled,
green gentleman just left.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.266
Who's going
to help me clean up

10:24.333 --> 10:26.200
after me tea party?

10:26.266 --> 10:28.367
Oh, uh, don't worry,
Mrs. Crustworthy.

10:28.433 --> 10:29.767
- We can do it!
- Yeah!

10:29.834 --> 10:31.166
We can be kind
like Kind Kalima.

10:31.233 --> 10:34.166
Oh, no--
like "Kind Oscar!"

10:34.233 --> 10:36.467
Yes! Like "Kind Oscar!"

10:36.533 --> 10:38.266
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

10:38.333 --> 10:39.734
"Kind Oscar." Wow. Heh heh.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.033
Well, I guess it's true.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.934
We all have
a little kindness
inside us...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.467
even Oscar.

10:44.533 --> 10:45.967
Well, let's start
the party.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.433
Now, young Rudy,

10:47.500 --> 10:49.233
would you care
for a finger sandwich?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.400
Oh. Elmo wants one,
too, please.

10:51.467 --> 10:52.367
This one
or this one?

10:55.266 --> 10:57.500
Did you see
a kind moment?

10:57.567 --> 10:59.834
Let's remember together!

10:59.900 --> 11:00.834
Stuck in a tree.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.400
- Stuck in a tree.
- Yep.

11:02.467 --> 11:03.400
That's no problem.

11:03.467 --> 11:04.767
Leave it to me!

11:04.834 --> 11:07.433
Ugh. See this, boys?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.300
Just keep it in mind.

11:09.367 --> 11:12.000

14:35.033 --> 14:37.033
I'm Aman,
and I need your help.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.233
It's hot, and I want
to do something kind

and make something cold
I can share with my friends.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.467

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.967
Uh, ooh, look

14:57.033 --> 15:00.400
Oh, boy.

Me got brain freeze.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.900
What we need

15:20.967 --> 15:23.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Let's see what we got. OK.

15:23.066 --> 15:26.400
We need ice cubes,
frozen blue-ba-berries,

15:26.467 --> 15:30.900
frozen straw-ba-berries,
and a bananananana.

15:30.967 --> 15:33.100
OK.
Nice, cold smoothie

15:33.166 --> 15:34.166
ready to share.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.100
Whoa, Cookie. Wait!

15:36.166 --> 15:37.500
It's not ready yet!

15:37.567 --> 15:39.266
We need the milk!

15:39.333 --> 15:41.834
Milk? Uh, you sure
about that?

15:41.900 --> 15:43.400
- Yes.
- OK.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.166
Well, in that case, um,

15:45.233 --> 15:46.967
yeah, me got
some bad news.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.633
You drank the milk.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.934
Mmm... yes.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.433
Oh, that's OK.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.233
We can get more.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.867
We can

15:56.934 --> 15:59.333
Oh, milk comes
from the cows.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.233
That crazy! From cows?

16:02.300 --> 16:04.233
- Mm-hmm.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.100
You'll see. Come on.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.367
Ok. I'm curious
how it come from a cow.

16:16.700 --> 16:20.934
- To the dairy farm!
- To the dairy farm!

16:22.834 --> 16:25.033
Cookie Monster:
We're going to the dairy farm.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.433
Cookie Monster:
Hello, little dairy farmer.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.233
Uh, can you help us, please?

16:34.300 --> 16:38.100
We need milk
for our cool fruit smoothies.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.900
Girl: Hi, Cookie Monster.
Hi, Gonger.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.934
Welcome to my family's
dairy farm.

16:42.033 --> 16:44.700
This is where we take care
of the cows that make milk.

16:49.567 --> 16:51.533
Girl: Milk comes
from the cow's udder.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.667
Sometimes,
we milk cows by hand,

16:54.734 --> 16:56.400
but most of the time,
we use a machine

16:56.467 --> 16:58.767
to milk the cow.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.867
Then it gets stored
in a tank and sent

17:00.934 --> 17:03.533
to the dairy plant
in a truck.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.500
We keep it cold
the whole time

17:05.567 --> 17:08.166
so it stays fresh,
healthy, and delicious.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.500
The dairy plant puts it
in bottles and cartons

17:11.567 --> 17:13.867
and sends it
to the grocery store.

17:13.934 --> 17:16.300
Milk makes your bones
and teeth strong and healthy,

17:16.367 --> 17:17.500
and it's good
for making things

17:17.567 --> 17:19.500
like cool fruit smoothies.

17:19.567 --> 17:20.734
Thanks for visiting!

17:20.800 --> 17:21.767
Bye-bye!

17:21.834 --> 17:22.767
Cookie Monster:
Thank you, farmer.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.800
Gonger: Too-do-loo!

17:23.867 --> 17:25.266
Cookie Monster:
Thank you, cows.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.934
Cookie Monster:
We got milk from the dairy farm.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.467
Oh, goodie,
goodie, goodie.

17:31.533 --> 17:34.200
We got the milk to make
the fruit smoothies.

17:34.266 --> 17:35.800
Yeah. Ooh.
I'm gonna check
the recipe.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.333
OK!

17:37.400 --> 17:39.867
Gonger: OK, Cookie.
You put in the ice cube.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.567
Cookie Monster:
Ice cubes going in.

17:41.633 --> 17:42.967
Gonger: Oh, yeah.

17:43.033 --> 17:46.600
And then we're gonna get
some frozen blue-ba-berries.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.000
Cookie Monster:
Frozen blueberries.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.000
Me drop one,
but that OK.

17:49.066 --> 17:50.367
Gonger: That OK.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.533
Gonger:
And then the frozen
straw-ba-berries!

17:52.600 --> 17:54.934
Cookie Monster:
OK. Here the frozen
strawberries.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.233
- Oh, boy
- OK. Yeah.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.667
Gonger: And now,
the chopped bananananan.

17:58.734 --> 18:00.700
Chopped banana!

18:00.767 --> 18:02.100
Hiyah!

18:04.066 --> 18:05.533
Cookie Monster:
Chopped banana going in.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.233
Gonger: Good job!

18:07.300 --> 18:09.266
Cookie Monster:
Here come the milk.

18:09.333 --> 18:13.300
Gonger: Now it's time
to blend it. Mmm.

18:13.367 --> 18:17.367
Whaah!

18:17.433 --> 18:20.266
Ohh. Ooh!

18:21.867 --> 18:23.934
It's ready! Hee hee hee!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.700
Order up!

18:27.266 --> 18:29.133
Sayonara, smoothie!

18:29.200 --> 18:31.133
Toodle-oo!

18:31.200 --> 18:33.300
Aww. Oh, Cookie Monster.

18:33.367 --> 18:34.934
Yeah.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.967
I got this nice
for you.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.967
Oh, thank you, Gonger.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.734
- Yeah.
- Aww.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.300
Ha ha! Yeah!

18:45.567 --> 18:47.300
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.967
Thanks, Cookie Monster.
Thanks, Gonger.

18:50.033 --> 18:52.200
It was very kind of you
to make these for us.

18:52.266 --> 18:54.266
These smoothies are
a great and healthy snack

18:54.333 --> 18:55.934
for sharing. Bye!

20:27.834 --> 20:31.834
Oh! Guess what
Elmo is wondering
about today.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.800
Wait for it.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.600
Wait for it.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.367
Boy, he looks sad.

20:41.433 --> 20:45.100
Oh, but a friend
is giving him a flower.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.834
Oh, ho ho! Oh, boy.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.567
That's so kind.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.900
Kindness! Yeah!

20:50.967 --> 20:53.200
Oh! Elmo wants
to find out more.

20:53.266 --> 20:57.800
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie!

20:57.867 --> 20:59.133
Let's ask her together.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.133
Elmo and kids:
Oh, Smartie!

21:05.100 --> 21:06.900
I'm here. Here I am!

21:06.967 --> 21:08.500
Ho ho ho!
Hi, Smartie!

21:08.567 --> 21:10.367
- Hiya, Elmo.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.600
Why is Smartie
facing backwards?

21:12.667 --> 21:14.800
'Cause I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

21:14.867 --> 21:16.133
Surprise!

21:16.200 --> 21:17.200
Ha ha ha!

21:17.266 --> 21:18.333
I drew a picture of us.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.166
Elmo loves
that, Smartie!

21:20.233 --> 21:22.767
Boy, that's so kind.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.800
Oh, and that's exactly
why Elmo called.

21:25.867 --> 21:29.433
Elmo wants to learn
more about kindness.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.467
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:31.533 --> 21:34.934
All:
We look it up!

21:36.367 --> 21:37.467
Smartie:
Let's see.

21:37.533 --> 21:40.400
Searching for kindness.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.400
Kindness is doing nice things
to show you care.

21:43.467 --> 21:46.567
There are lots of ways
to be kind...

21:46.633 --> 21:50.066
like taking turns...

21:50.133 --> 21:52.000
or sharing...

21:52.066 --> 21:54.166
or showing that you care
by helping clean up

21:54.233 --> 21:57.700
and taking care
of the environment...

21:57.767 --> 22:02.333
or my personal favorite:
giving hugs.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.367
Oh, ho ho! That's
Elmo's favorite, too!

22:05.433 --> 22:07.967
Oh, thank you
for your help, Smartie.

22:08.033 --> 22:09.300
You're welcome, Elmo.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.900
Well, I'm off to volunteer
at the old phones home.

22:11.967 --> 22:15.033
Aww. That's so kind of you.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.333
Yeah. I really get
a charge from it.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.767
Ha ha ha!

22:18.834 --> 22:20.800
Thank you, Smartie. Bye-bye.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.066
Ha ha ha!

22:22.133 --> 22:25.834
Hey! That gives Elmo
an idea.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.266
Oh. Let's play
a game together.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.367
Yeah!

22:29.433 --> 22:31.066
Come on, come on.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.400
Ha ha ha!

22:37.700 --> 22:38.900
Elmo: Hey!

22:38.967 --> 22:42.066
Let's do something
kind for Dorothy.

22:42.133 --> 22:45.033
Oh. Let's help Dorothy
find her food.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.500
Kid:
Go! Go up!

22:46.567 --> 22:47.934
Kid 2:
Yeah, up!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.834
Kid 3:
Go up, Dorothy!

22:49.900 --> 22:52.967
Great! Now which way
should Dorothy go?

22:53.033 --> 22:54.300
Kid:
Go down.

22:54.367 --> 22:56.233
Kid 2:
Yeah, down!

22:56.300 --> 22:57.834
Too far!

22:57.900 --> 23:01.367
Elmo:
Uh-oh! Dorothy went too far.

23:01.433 --> 23:04.133
Kid:
Go back, Dorothy.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.300
Kid 2:
Now go up!

23:06.367 --> 23:08.333
Elmo:
That's it! Keep going!

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
Dorothy did it!

23:11.266 --> 23:13.533
Oh, and it looks
like Dorothy sure was hungry.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.834
Oh, ho ho!
Bye-bye, Dorothy.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.400
Oh, boy. Elmo loves
to help his friends.

23:19.467 --> 23:23.200
That's one of Elmo's
favorite ways to be kind.

23:23.266 --> 23:26.734
Hey! Elmo wonders...

23:26.800 --> 23:29.934
What does Mr. Noodle do
to be kind?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.367
Hey. Let's go ask him.

23:31.433 --> 23:35.400
♪ Oh, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:35.467 --> 23:38.200
Hey! It's
Mr. Noodle's brother,

23:38.266 --> 23:39.533
Mr. Noodle.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.266
Elmo and kids:
Hi, Mr. Noodle.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.834
Elmo: Oh. Mr. Noodle,
what are you favorite ways

23:44.900 --> 23:46.233
to be kind?

23:48.367 --> 23:51.000
Kid:
Hey. That's juggling.

23:51.066 --> 23:53.834
Elmo: Oh! Elmo thinks
you're a great juggler, but--

23:53.900 --> 23:55.967
Kids:
That's not being kind.

23:56.033 --> 23:57.200
Elmo:
Oh. Well, you got it?

23:57.266 --> 23:58.200
OK. What?

23:58.266 --> 23:59.533
Oh, ho ho ho!

23:59.600 --> 24:01.100
Kid: Hey.
He's dancing with a ribbon.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.834
Elmo: Mr. Noodle,
that's not being kind either.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.867
What

24:06.934 --> 24:09.100
Kid: Look at that!
He's doing a card trick.

24:09.166 --> 24:11.100
Elmo: Oh, that's
very nice, Mr. Noodle.

24:11.166 --> 24:14.200
Uh-huh. Very nice, but,
you know, that's a--

24:14.266 --> 24:16.333
that's an impressive trick,
but, Mr. Noodle,

24:16.400 --> 24:18.166
that's not
being kind either.

24:18.233 --> 24:20.800
Kid:
No! That's not being kind!

24:20.867 --> 24:22.967
Elmo:
What? Oh, boy.

24:23.033 --> 24:25.967
Oh, no.
Mr. Noodle made a mess.

24:26.033 --> 24:27.867
Kid:
Hey! He's helping clean up.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.233
Elmo:
You did it, Mr. Noodle!

24:29.300 --> 24:31.433
You showed us kindness
by cleaning up!

24:33.600 --> 24:35.266
Bye, Mr. Noodle.

24:35.333 --> 24:39.367
