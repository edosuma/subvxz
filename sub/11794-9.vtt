WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.773
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:09.676
 <i>* I don't think</i>
 <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.612
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.645 --> 00:16.015
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.049 --> 00:21.821
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.924
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.958 --> 00:27.861
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.894 --> 00:30.797
 <i>* Ridin' low on my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.830 --> 00:34.467
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it will be all right</i>

00:34.501 --> 00:38.838
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:55.622
  <i>* It's all right</i>

00:55.655 --> 00:58.625

00:58.658 --> 01:02.595
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:21.247
   It's Career Week at school,
   and everybody's excited.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.582
   I'm not.

01:22.615 --> 01:26.553
 It's the first sign
 our parents aren't
 gonna support us forever.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.258
 I didn't know you wanted
 a career in medicine.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.261
  Why not?
  I'm sick of school.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.933
  Zack, do you really want
  to become a doctor?

01:39.966 --> 01:41.868
 Well, Kelly,
 what I'm looking for

01:41.901 --> 01:44.537
 is the most amount of money
 for the least amount of work.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.774
 "Jack in the Box"
 already has a clown.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.142
  Very funny.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.244
  Actually, Kelly, I want to be
  a game show host.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.280
 All you have to do
 is brush your teeth and smile.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.784
  That's all we need,
  a male Vanna White.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.353
 I'm kind of thinking about
 being a housewife,

02:00.387 --> 02:02.055
or an actress.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.723
 Do you think I'd be
 a good actress, Zack?

02:03.757 --> 02:07.093
  Oh, fantastic.
  Every night you
  star in my dreams.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.065
   - Hey,
   Screech, what are you doing?
   - Moonwalking.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.068
  I want to be an astronaut
  and go into space.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.671
   Be sure to get
   a one-way ticket.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.276
 Hey, Slater, what career table
 are you interested in?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.679
  Hey, right now the only thing
  I'm interested in

02:25.712 --> 02:28.181
   is my wrestling match
   against Valley on Friday.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.917
  Well, Slater, you really
  ought to think
  about your future.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.721
Good idea. After practice,
let's go to the beach.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.756
No women!
The man is in training.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.893
 He's wrestling Marvin Nedick,
 Valley's undefeated champion.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.594
   What's with you, Preppie?

02:41.628 --> 02:43.797
  Why are you so interested
  in helping me?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.265
   Time out!

02:46.700 --> 02:48.101
What our
contestants don't know

02:48.101 --> 02:51.705
 is that every year I've bet
 against Nedick and every
 year I've lost.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.240
   But this year he's
   going up against Slater.

02:54.274 --> 02:57.110
Now, Don, tell our audience
what I expect to win.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.946
  <i>Well, Zack,</i>
  <i>Marvin Nedick's dirt bike,</i>

03:00.046 --> 03:02.615
<i>with</i>
<i>steel-belted radial tires,</i>
<i>molded handgrips,</i>

03:02.649 --> 03:05.118
   <i>plus a comfort cushion seat</i>
   <i>and racing stripe.</i>

03:05.151 --> 03:08.288
   <i>Retail value?</i>
   <i>Over $500, Zack!</i>

03:08.321 --> 03:10.223
 ( audience applauds )

03:14.094 --> 03:15.628
   Time in!

03:15.662 --> 03:17.897
  I don't need
  your help, Preppie.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.670
 I'm gonna flatten Nedick
 in the first minute.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.271
   Time out!

03:25.972 --> 03:27.774
Yahoo!

03:30.810 --> 03:34.314
 Hey, you guys, I finally
 decided what I'm going to be.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.083
Well, welcome to
"Guess Lisa's Career."

03:37.083 --> 03:39.719
 Let's meet out first
 contestant. Jessie,
 tell us where you're from.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.087
Shut up, Zack.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.857
Is that near San Diego?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.159
  I want to be
  a fashion designer.
  Move over, Calvin,

03:46.192 --> 03:49.295
  it's time for my name
  to be on everyone's behind.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.097
   Good answer, good answer.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.099
   Hey, Max, how did you
   pick your career?

03:53.099 --> 03:55.935
   Well, it was a choice
   between being a magician,

03:55.969 --> 03:57.671
   or running a restaurant.

03:57.704 --> 03:58.872
   How'd you decide?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.373
  I was much better
  at flipping burgers

04:00.407 --> 04:03.276
 than I was pulling rabbits
 out of my hat.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.048
   See what I mean?

04:10.650 --> 04:13.687
 And shall we all try and guess
 what career Jessie has chosen?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.922
  Hey, who are you?
  Zack Sajak?

04:15.955 --> 04:17.290
  Hopefully.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.791
I want to be a lawyer.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.927
   I'll design your briefs.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.332
 And now let's hear from
 the beautiful Kelly Kapowski.

04:26.366 --> 04:31.104
 I've changed my mind.
 I wanna be a judge
 so l can lock you up.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.073
 Kelly, have you decided
 what you want to be?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.241
  Hey, wait a second,
  you're in fashion.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.443
  I'm the host here.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.078
 I still want to be an actress,

04:38.078 --> 04:40.313
but I also want to be a mom
and have lots of kids.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.917
  And one day,
  I'd like to
  help you with that.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.385
 Why have a litter of Preppies

04:45.418 --> 04:49.155
 when you can have a bunch
 of little
 stud-muffins like me?

04:50.757 --> 04:53.293
  You'd have to have a good job
  to support a big family.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.495
 What kind of career
 are you planning on?

04:56.162 --> 04:58.098
Career?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.833
Well, I... I...

04:59.866 --> 05:01.334
  Hey, the man has a career!

05:01.368 --> 05:05.271
You've heard of Hulk Hogan?
He's "Slammer Slater!"

05:07.040 --> 05:09.776
  Yeah.
  Yeah, that's what I'll be.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.244
  I'll be a wrestler.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.179
 Well,
 that's fine for now, Slater,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.914
  but what are you gonna be
  when you grow up?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
  - All: Yeah, Slater.
  - Jessie: You gotta decide.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.285
 Now let's try and guess
 what career Slater has chosen.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.421
 Jessie:
 It's a very crucial decision.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.723
 - ( knocking on door )
 - Come in!

05:25.091 --> 05:27.360
Can I see you for a second,
Mr. Belding?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.762
  Certainly.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.797
  Time's up.
  ( laughs )

05:34.768 --> 05:37.337
I'm just kidding.
What can l do for you?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.874
Sir, I have a problem.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.942
   It's kind of personal...

05:42.976 --> 05:44.911
but never mind,
I can see you're busy.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.747
 No, no, no...
 I am never too busy.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.984
 Come on in, son.
 Consider me a friend.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.420
  A <i>compadre.</i>
  One righteous dude.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.357
 Okay.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.125
Mr. Belding...

05:59.159 --> 06:02.228
  you see, I'm having a problem
  choosing a career.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.165
  Did you know what you wanted
  to be when you were a kid?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.734
   There were times
   when I wanted to
   be a test pilot,

06:07.767 --> 06:11.504
 or a race car driver,
 or stuntman.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.808
 But they didn't offer the same
 sense of risk and adventure

06:14.841 --> 06:17.110
   as school administration.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.214
I can understand that.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.582
   You know, in high school

06:22.615 --> 06:27.153
 I did have visions of becoming
 a professional
 basketball player.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.055
   What stopped you?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.191
 Sister Agnes.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.260
 She kept blocking my lay-ups.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.564
Besides, can you imagine me
dribbling down
the court at 50,

06:37.597 --> 06:41.801
 with my belly hanging out
 and my love handles
 tripping the referee?

06:41.835 --> 06:45.105
   My gosh, I would have
   looked foolish
   in that uniform.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.507
   I remember the time
   when I was in high school

06:47.540 --> 06:50.076
I cut down
the court to my right,
they fed me the ball...

06:51.945 --> 06:54.180
   Welcome back to Bayside.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.483
  It's just great to see
  all you guys again.

06:56.516 --> 07:00.153
You know, there never
was a class like yours.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.324
   Gotcha, Belding!

07:04.357 --> 07:06.526
   That's still great, Max.

07:06.559 --> 07:11.131
  And now, the first judge ever
  to graduate from Bayside...

07:11.164 --> 07:13.466
  Judge Jessie Spano.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.902
  ( crowd cheers, applauds )

07:18.905 --> 07:22.409
   - We're honored, Your Honor.
   - That pleases the court.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.048
 Oh,
 Lisa, I just love your jeans.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.583
 - They are fabulous!
 - Well, yes.

07:30.617 --> 07:35.055
 The name Lisa stands
 for quality, and I'm behind
 every pair I sell.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.565
  ( beeping )

07:50.603 --> 07:53.239
 What's that?

07:53.273 --> 07:55.442
Wow, Captain
Screech Powers,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.544
 great space explorer.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.884
  Even you achieved your dream.
  What is it like in space?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.520
   Far out. Have a Mars bar.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.523
 Is there really life on Mars?

08:10.557 --> 08:14.027
 Not really,
 all the good
 clubs close at 9:00.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.101
And now,
Bayside's favorite son,

08:21.134 --> 08:24.904
 and the most successful
 game show host ever,

08:24.938 --> 08:27.040
 Zack Morris.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.515
  Thank you, Richard,
  and hello, Bayside.

08:35.548 --> 08:39.318
 Let me introduce
 my lovely wife, Kelly Morris.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.959
 Now,
 Kelly is gonna present you
 with a brand new,

08:46.059 --> 08:48.061
   19-inch, cable-ready TV!

08:53.166 --> 08:55.368
  Well, Kelly,
  you're a successful model,

08:55.402 --> 08:58.505
  a former Miss Everything,
  what else is new?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.007
  Now that I'm married to Zack,
  we have a beautiful home,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.109
 three kids,
 two cats, and a dog.

09:03.143 --> 09:06.079
Retail value of home,
kids, and pets:

09:06.112 --> 09:08.648
   $732,000.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.364
 Hey, everybody, remember me?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.933
 That can't be Slater.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.135
 It is. He's lost
 30 matches in a row.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.570
  Honey, he's over the hill.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.642
 That's because he
 never picked a career

09:35.675 --> 09:37.477
 during Career Week in school.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.946
  Wow, he used to be a jock.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.048
   Now he's a joke.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.689
   And that's how I became
   the Flo-Jo of principals.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.059
 Well, son,
 I hope I've been of some help.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.128
   More than you know, sir.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.231
 ( mimicking engine revving )

09:59.632 --> 10:01.267
  Hey, picture it, Screech...

10:01.301 --> 10:04.270
 we're cruising down the coast,
 wind in our hair,

10:04.304 --> 10:07.407
and chicks just
begging us for a ride.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.043
   No room, baby.
   Maybe next time.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.146
 When I win Nedick's dirt bike,

10:13.179 --> 10:16.082
   this fantasy will
   become a reality.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.284
  What did you bet
  against Nedick's dirt bike?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.354
   - My dirt bike.
   - But you don't have one.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.722
 What are you gonna do
 if you lose?

10:22.756 --> 10:25.692
  I can't lose.
  Nedick's wrestling Slater.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.328
 Okay, babes, hop on.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.230
 I'm driving.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.302
 Screech, what are you doing?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.238
 Cruising for chicks.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.142
   In the boys locker room?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.743
 ( whistles )

10:43.777 --> 10:46.579
 Hey, Slater,
 shouldn't you be at practice?

10:46.613 --> 10:49.115
   I heard Nedick's threatening
   to tie your
   tongue to your toes,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.717
  and use you as a hula hoop.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.386
   - He said that?
   - Mm-hmm.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.689
  Who cares about wrestling?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.190
  Well, I do.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.825
 Your fans do.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.894
 I do.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.729
   Look,
   forget about it, Preppie.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.065
   You think I wanna end up
   an overweight,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.633
  beer-bellied laughingstock?

11:06.666 --> 11:10.337
  My mom always said you could
  be anything you want to be.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.139
   I quit wrestling.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.542
   What? You quit wrestling?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.677
 - What, are you crazy?
 - No.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.779
   I'm off the team.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.384
   This is bad news.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.454
  Not for Slater. Now you'll be
  Nedick's hula hoop.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.098
   Hey, Zack, here's your fries
   and hot dog.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.433
I'd rather have
a guard dog with fangs.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.569
If Slater doesn't
wrestle on Friday,
I'm dead meat.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.738
   Slater reminds me
   a lot of my dad.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.806
What, your father's
a 15-year-old wrestler?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.409
 No, a 50-year-old taxi driver.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.811
   One day he
   decided to give it up,
   and stay at home.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.948
 So my mom put an apron on him,
 showed him the kitchen.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.384
By dinnertime,
his meter was running.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
 Interesting.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.930
 ( deep voice )
 Hello, Major Slater?

12:10.964 --> 12:14.367
 This is AC's guidance
 counselor at Bayside.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.436
   My name?

12:17.537 --> 12:20.073
   Mr. Footer, Frank Footer.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.078
  I'd like to talk to you
  about your son, AC.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.747
 He has a lot of
 free time on his
 hands since he quit wrestling,

12:27.781 --> 12:29.783
 and I think he should join...

12:31.918 --> 12:35.588
   So, champ,
   how you keeping
   busy these days?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.790
   What's it to you?

12:36.823 --> 12:38.625
I figured
that without wrestling,

12:38.658 --> 12:40.560
you have a lot of free time
on your hands.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.431
 I hope you've found
 a constructive way to fill it.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.000
 You know, my dad
 said the same thing.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.803
You're kidding.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.839
   I'm sure whatever advice
   he gave you it's
   worth following.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.710
   It wasn't advice,
   it was an order.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.479
 Then you'd probably
 get in a lot of trouble
 if you didn't listen.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.880
Yeah, probably.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.551
 He wants me to
 find an after-school
 activity to replace wrestling.

13:04.584 --> 13:08.054
 And suddenly girl watching
 doesn't count.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.889
 There is one after-school club

13:09.923 --> 13:12.692
   where you can't help
   but watch girls.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.695
 Yeah?

13:15.729 --> 13:18.465
  Yeah, but I don't
  want to interfere.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.202
Wait a minute.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.938
- Go ahead, I'm listening.
- I don't know, Slater.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.941
   It takes a special
   kind of guy to
   be in this club.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.210
Try me.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.413
 Think you're man enough
 for the Cooking Club?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.686
 Cooking Club?
 What, are you crazy?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.087
   That's for girls.

13:41.121 --> 13:45.091
  Hi, guys. Bye, guys.
  I'm late for Cooking Club.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.161
 So am I.
 Thanks for the tip, Preppie.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.232
  Slater in an apron?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.501
   He'll be laughed
   right back into the gym.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.804
 Hey, even I'll make
 muffins to see that.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.607
 Today we're going
 to make a layer cake

14:00.640 --> 14:02.642
   with chocolate, vanilla,

14:02.676 --> 14:05.512
   and lots of gooey fudge.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.882
 So put on your aprons
 before the food starts to fly.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.756
   You look pretty
   in pink, Preppie.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.558
 Thanks for noticing.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.127
   You'll all find recipes
   on your counter.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.164
  Step one: throw them away!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.668
Because I like to cook
the way I feel,

14:28.702 --> 14:31.071
   and I feel good.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.572
   <i>* Da-da da da-dah</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:36.242
 <i>* Take two eggs</i>
 <i>da-da da da-dah</i>
 <i>And mix them around</i>

14:36.276 --> 14:38.078
 All: <i>* Da da-da dah</i>

14:38.078 --> 14:41.748
  <i>* Take some butter</i>
  <i>don't drop it on the ground</i>

14:41.781 --> 14:43.083
All: <i>* Da-da da da-dah</i>

14:43.083 --> 14:44.184
   <i>* Put in some milk</i>

14:44.217 --> 14:45.618
   All: <i>* Da-da da da-dah</i>

14:45.652 --> 14:46.820
  <i>* Then add some flour</i>

14:46.853 --> 14:47.954
  <i>* Da-da da da-dah</i>

14:47.987 --> 14:51.958
  <i>* And what you've got</i>
  <i>is done in an hour</i>

14:51.991 --> 14:53.226
 <i>*  I'm bakin' a cake</i>

14:53.259 --> 14:54.761
 All: <i>* Whew!</i>

14:54.794 --> 14:56.096
   <i>* I'm bakin' a cake</i>

14:56.096 --> 14:57.297
<i>* Whew!</i>

14:57.330 --> 15:00.333
  <i>* I'm bakin' a ca-aa-ke... *</i>

15:03.536 --> 15:04.738
 Cake!

15:04.771 --> 15:06.673
  All: Whew!

15:08.575 --> 15:11.644
 Mine looks good. Let's see
 how the rest of
 yours turned out.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.713
   ( tapping feet )

15:17.684 --> 15:19.619
   Not bad.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.054
 Not terrible.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.057
   Ooh, not edible.

15:24.057 --> 15:28.561
 Now this takes the cake.
 Young man, you are a talent.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.598
 Perfect form,
 perfect consistency.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.269
 Mmm!

15:36.302 --> 15:38.972
 And it tastes good, too!
 Everyone, taste this.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.841
 Ooh, not too much.
 I'm taking this home.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.845
  Slater, I didn't know
  you were such a great cook.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.281
   - Neither did I.
   - Try some, Zack.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.856
   This is terrible.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.694
  It's moist.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.228
  It's light.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.064
It's delicious.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.232
   I'm a hula hoop.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.604
  Slater, I can't believe
  you made this cake.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.206
It's wonderful.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.943
  I am really impressed.
  I never knew you
  were so sensitive.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.045
I love sensitive guys.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.613
Really?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.949
   You know, I cried when
   I cracked that last egg.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.051
 Zack:
 Oh, come on.

16:25.051 --> 16:29.055
  Lisa,
  a bologna sandwich turns me
  into an emotional dishrag.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.191
 Wring it out in the kitchen.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.593
  Okay, okay.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.662
 So Slater's cake
 rose to the occasion.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.264
  Well, if you can't beat them,
  bring in someone who can.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.373
 Hey, Slater.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.208
 Hey, Nedick.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.277
   I hear you gave up wrestling
   to do some baking.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.947
   That's right.
   And you're lucky.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.982
  I'm gonna be
  a world-class chef.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.853
  These hands are
  gonna be cracking
  eggs instead of your neck.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.721
 Ooh.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.857
  I bet you look real sweet
  in an apron.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.259
   - Is that right?
   - Hey, tough guy,

17:06.291 --> 17:10.063
   before you put him down,
   you should try his
   cherries jubilee.

17:10.096 --> 17:14.334
 I see you've got girls
 fighting your battles now,
 Betty Crocker.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.736
 Slater isn't
 gonna stand for that.

17:16.770 --> 17:20.373
Nedick, I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.944
Hey, you're right.
He never left his seat.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.747
   To me,
   you look like a chicken.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.849
 ( clucking )

17:31.785 --> 17:33.920
   Let me tell you
   something, Bubba,

17:33.953 --> 17:35.822
it takes a stronger man
not to fight.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.692
  So why don't you go back into
  the mist with
  the other gorillas?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.060
 Ooh.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.229
Morris, we gotta talk.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.665
- Now.
- Now is good.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.169
  - So how's school?
  - Shut up.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.704
   My next thought.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.106
  About our little bet,
  you lose.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.274
 But the match
 isn't until Friday.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.942
  You might as
  well forfeit now.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.078
   Who's gonna
   take Slater's place, you?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.146
Look, Slater will be there.
Don't worry.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.115
Who's worried?

18:02.148 --> 18:03.717
   Come Friday,
   I'm gonna be riding
   something in the dirt...

18:03.750 --> 18:06.052
 either your bike,
 or your face.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.024
  Boy, is he stupid.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.893
 What's he gonna do,
 kick-start your face?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.037
Zack, I've always dreamed
about going into space,

18:24.037 --> 18:26.706
  but I didn't want to be
  launched by Marvin Nedick.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.909
 Neither do I.
 Come on, Screech,
 you're my last hope.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.045
  And when Slater sees you
  dressed like this,

18:32.045 --> 18:33.246
he won't let you
wrestle Nedick.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.848
   You sure?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.117
   Trust me, he'll come
   flying out and pin Nedick

18:37.150 --> 18:41.287
before you can say,
"Hey, that's my arm.
Give it back."

18:41.321 --> 18:42.956
 And if you're wrong?

18:43.056 --> 18:47.193
 Well, we'll call it,
 "The Screech
 Memorial Gymnasium."

18:47.227 --> 18:49.863
 You'd do that for me?

18:49.896 --> 18:52.165
 Wow.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.067
All right, what do you want
to show me, Preppie?

18:54.100 --> 18:57.737
 Make it quick.
 I've got a quiche in the oven.

18:57.771 --> 19:01.307
 I just wanted you to see who's
 gonna wrestle
 Nedick in your place.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.176
   Screech?

19:04.277 --> 19:06.279
 ( laughing )

19:08.348 --> 19:11.885
   Don't worry, Slater,
   you'll be safe
   in Cooking Club.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.355
 I'll take care of Nedick.
 You go hide behind your apron.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.657
Take it on home, Zack.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.130
 Come on, Zack,
 is he really
 gonna wrestle Nedick?

19:24.164 --> 19:27.233
  Yeah.
  You just gonna stand there
  while Screech gets sliced,

19:27.267 --> 19:29.035
 diced and put on ice?

19:29.035 --> 19:32.038
 No. Actually,
 I have to check on my quiche.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.313
  All: <i>* Beat ba-beat</i>
 <i>ba-buh-buh-buh-beat beat</i>

19:40.347 --> 19:42.382
 <i>* Beat ba-beat ba-buh-buh-buh</i>
 <i>beat go Bayside!</i>

19:42.415 --> 19:44.718
   <i>* Beat ba-beat</i>
   <i>ba-buh-buh-buh-beat beat</i>

19:44.751 --> 19:46.886
 <i>* Beat ba-beat ba-buh-buh-buh</i>
 <i>beat go Bayside! *</i>

19:46.920 --> 19:48.421
 ( cheering )

19:57.897 --> 20:01.768
 - Who are you?
 - Screech "The Body" Powers.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.970
  - What are you doing?
  - Trying to intimidate you.

20:04.004 --> 20:05.438
  How is it working?

20:05.472 --> 20:07.307
- Where's Slater?
- I killed him.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.876
 I wanted first crack at you.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.945
   - Out of the way,
   you little twerp.
   - Hey, tough guy.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.347
  Here's a hint
  of what's to come.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.753
  Had enough?

20:19.786 --> 20:22.055
   - What is Screech
   doing out there?
   - Is he wrestling Nedick?

20:22.088 --> 20:25.892
 Oh great, just my luck.
 He'll throw Screech in my lap.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.894
Quit now while
you're still standing.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.896
   - Move aside, shrimp.
   - Hey, butthead,

20:29.929 --> 20:33.733
 your mom's ugly,
 your dad's ugly,
 and your dog's ugly.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.170
   Hey, my dog is not ugly.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.539
  You're right,
  he's not, compared to you.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.410
   Hey, Screech,
   we've gotta talk.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.845
   Not now, Zack. I've got him
   right where we want him.

20:45.879 --> 20:48.448
 I hope he stays there,
 because Slater's not coming.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.817
  Not coming?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.185
 Nedick: Hey, shrimp!

20:52.218 --> 20:54.854
I'm taking care of you now.
I'm not waiting for
the match to begin.

20:54.888 --> 20:56.823
 Neither am I.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.059
One, two, three.
Pinned. I lose.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.561
   Congratulations,
   smooth takedown.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.331
 ( screaming )

21:07.133 --> 21:09.936
All right, Nedick,
hand him over!

21:12.305 --> 21:14.341
   Don't talk about his dog.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.546
  Now, let's see how you do
  with someone your own size.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.003
  ( birds chirping )

21:44.237 --> 21:46.373
 - Bayside.
 - Slater, you were terrific.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.608
  But I thought you
  were gonna quit wrestling?

21:48.641 --> 21:51.444
   My quiche blew up,
   and I realized...

21:51.478 --> 21:54.114
hey, I didn't care.
I'm just a kid.

21:54.114 --> 21:55.281
  I don't need
  a career right now.

21:55.315 --> 21:59.285
Yeah, we feel the same way.
We'll worry
about it next year.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.188
   - What happened?
   - I flattened you, wimp.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.562
I finally beat you, Nedick.
Your dirt bike's mine.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.798
I won the bet.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.535
  No, Zack, you lose.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.237
 Gambling is a no-no,

22:17.270 --> 22:20.073
   and I am sure you know
   what that means.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.075
   Uh-huh,
   an all-expense-paid trip

22:22.075 --> 22:24.911
to detention
here at lovely Bayside,

22:24.944 --> 22:27.180
 the detention capital
 of the world.

22:33.086 --> 22:36.089
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
