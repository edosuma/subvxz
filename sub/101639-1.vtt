00:27.259 --> 00:29.562
I'm normal.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.762
I'm like everybody else.

00:30.795 --> 00:33.265
I'm normal.
I'm a regular kid.

00:33.298 --> 00:34.466
I'm normal.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.201
I'm a regular kid.
I'm normal.

00:36.234 --> 00:37.536
I'm a regular kid. I'm normal.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.271
Regular kid...

00:39.304 --> 00:41.341
I'm just like everyone else.

00:50.149 --> 00:52.384
I'm...

00:52.417 --> 00:54.554
I'm a normal kid, and...

00:56.822 --> 00:59.258
...I'll be strong.

01:27.186 --> 01:29.822
It's called
the Dragon's Dilemma,

01:29.855 --> 01:33.192
and the dilemma the Dragon has

01:33.224 --> 01:36.695
is whether to send you plunging
down 200 feet to the ground

01:36.728 --> 01:39.364
or up 200 feet in the air.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.534
Are you listening to me?

01:42.567 --> 01:44.469
I want to go home.

01:44.503 --> 01:47.674
It's my birthday... I should
decide what I get to do.

01:49.441 --> 01:51.811
No. You can't. You...

01:51.843 --> 01:55.413
Paul, you spend enough time
alone at home as it is.

01:57.349 --> 01:59.519
- Paul, I just spent five dollars on this.
- Hey, Paul.

01:59.552 --> 02:00.620
Is that you?

02:00.653 --> 02:02.421
How you doing, buddy?

02:02.453 --> 02:04.623
- You know these guys?
- Yeah, we're his friends.

02:04.656 --> 02:05.625
Oh. Hey.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.293
- You're his dad, right?
- Yeah.

02:07.325 --> 02:08.894
Huh.

02:08.927 --> 02:11.563
- So, how'd it feel?
- How'd what feel?

02:11.597 --> 02:13.199
When you screwed that dog
and made him.

02:17.703 --> 02:20.239
Tell me their names.

02:20.271 --> 02:22.774
They don't have names.

02:22.807 --> 02:24.810
Step right up...

02:29.414 --> 02:30.849
Uh...

02:30.883 --> 02:34.854
I was gonna give you this
tonight, but instead...

02:34.887 --> 02:36.489
Step right up!

02:36.521 --> 02:38.223
Happy birthday.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.427
Open it.

02:54.006 --> 02:56.474
Do you like it?

02:56.508 --> 02:58.912
You like it?

03:01.379 --> 03:03.248
Hey, don't worry
about those kids, okay?

03:03.282 --> 03:04.517
Just forget about 'em.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.285
You ready?

03:06.318 --> 03:07.554
Okay.

03:11.723 --> 03:13.592
- Okay, this is it.
- Dad, I don't want...

03:13.626 --> 03:15.260
Dad, I don't want to do this.

03:15.294 --> 03:17.362
Now, what do you do
when people make a comment?

03:17.395 --> 03:19.264
- Yeah, but you said...
- What do you do?

03:19.298 --> 03:20.733
- Dig-Dignity.
- Right, dignity.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.701
Show some dignity.
Stand up straight,

03:22.735 --> 03:25.237
you speak loud, and... I
can't make this clear enough...

03:25.270 --> 03:26.738
Paul, you don't run.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.473
Something happens,
you get nervous,

03:28.507 --> 03:30.408
you stay right where you are...

03:30.442 --> 03:32.478
and you don't run.

03:32.510 --> 03:33.679
Okay?

03:33.711 --> 03:36.548
Now take off your mask.

03:48.593 --> 03:49.929
Great.

03:53.564 --> 03:55.567
Dignity. Right?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.603
Stand up straight.

03:58.736 --> 04:00.740
Get on line.
You got this.

04:17.889 --> 04:19.457
I'll be strong.

04:19.490 --> 04:20.959
I'm a regular kid.
I'm normal.

04:20.992 --> 04:22.295
- Regular kid.
- Tickets.

04:22.327 --> 04:24.729
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.603
You got a ticket?

04:30.636 --> 04:32.305
So, how'd it feel?

04:32.338 --> 04:34.507
When you screwed that dog
and made him?

04:37.576 --> 04:39.579
Paul! Paul!

04:59.732 --> 05:01.000
Where's your dad now, buddy?

05:01.033 --> 05:02.902
I'll bet he's
back at the pound!

05:02.935 --> 05:04.437
He's probably fingering
your mother

05:04.470 --> 05:06.005
before they put her to sleep!

05:06.038 --> 05:07.907
My mom's not a dog!

05:07.939 --> 05:11.009
- Yeah? You ever met her?
- Shut up!

05:11.043 --> 05:13.778
Make me!

05:13.812 --> 05:15.413
Dog!

05:15.447 --> 05:18.617
Why don't you bark for us?

05:18.649 --> 05:20.819
Go on, bark!

05:20.853 --> 05:22.355
You heard him!

05:22.387 --> 05:24.823
- Bark!
- Bark for us, boy!

05:24.857 --> 05:26.992
He said bark!

05:27.024 --> 05:28.626
- Bark!
- Only thing you're good at!

05:28.660 --> 05:29.995
Bark, you idiot!

05:30.028 --> 05:31.430
Come on, we know you can do it!

05:31.463 --> 05:32.531
Spit it out!

05:32.564 --> 05:33.799
Bark, dog!

05:51.083 --> 05:53.386
I'm gonna go to my room.

05:59.557 --> 06:03.396
Look, I know you had
a rough day,

06:03.428 --> 06:06.031
but I really want
to show you something.

06:14.038 --> 06:18.543
Every child is
like a beautiful musical note.

06:18.576 --> 06:21.713
It's just that some notes are
more unique than other notes.

06:21.747 --> 06:24.182
What we like to do
is take those musical notes

06:24.216 --> 06:26.886
and put them together
and make a song.

06:26.918 --> 06:29.822
And we call that song
Bishop Griffin.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.657
Here at Bishop Griffin,

06:31.689 --> 06:34.826
we believe that a well-rounded
education comes from...

06:34.860 --> 06:37.730
embracing the differences
of those around us

06:37.762 --> 06:40.498
while creating a safe,
inclusive environment

06:40.531 --> 06:43.601
to learn, play and grow.

06:43.634 --> 06:45.805
Oh! Nice shot there, Byron.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.608
Every child has a right to be educated.

06:49.641 --> 06:52.578
Every child has a right
to be respected.

06:52.610 --> 06:56.081
Every child has
a right to be loved.

06:56.113 --> 06:57.750
Nice work there, buddy.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.951
- Who's that?
- Um, Iron Man.

06:59.985 --> 07:01.721
That's exactly what I thought.

07:03.922 --> 07:06.892
A griffin is not
a lion nor eagle.

07:06.925 --> 07:10.663
A griffin is
something else entirely.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.833
At Bishop Griffin's, we take
inspiration from the griffin.

07:13.865 --> 07:17.536
And together we teach
one another how to fly.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.641
Okay.

07:22.641 --> 07:24.110
What do you think?

07:28.247 --> 07:30.749
I think that if you send me
to this school,

07:30.781 --> 07:32.685
I will burn it to the ground.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.987
Yeah, right. Okay,

07:35.019 --> 07:37.956
I have one last
birthday present for you.

07:39.858 --> 07:42.093
Check this out.

07:43.127 --> 07:44.997
Try it on.

07:46.163 --> 07:47.933
Give it a shot.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.002
Paul.

08:20.031 --> 08:22.868
"To Paul, from Mom."

09:02.640 --> 09:04.543
Do you know
where this came from?

09:07.712 --> 09:08.880
Wow.

09:08.913 --> 09:10.649
Wow, look at you.
You look great.

09:10.682 --> 09:12.951
Look out, ladies.
James Bond over here.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.353
You don't know
where this came from?

09:14.385 --> 09:17.822
Oh, that? Yeah, that,
uh, came this afternoon.

09:17.855 --> 09:19.924
What was in it?

09:19.957 --> 09:21.225
Nothing.

09:21.259 --> 09:23.228
I can't get over
how great you look.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.096
- You look...
- I look like a Build-A-Bear.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.764
No, you don't.

09:26.798 --> 09:29.033
Yeah, I got a good feeling
about this school.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.168
I got a good...

09:30.201 --> 09:32.737
I got a good feeling.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.740
It's gonna be
a terrific opportunity

09:34.773 --> 09:36.609
for you
to meet people like you.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.310
I don't want to meet
people like me.

09:38.342 --> 09:40.078
Why not?

09:41.113 --> 09:43.583
Because I hate me.

09:48.653 --> 09:51.823
I, uh, I don't know
what to tell you, Paul.

09:51.856 --> 09:53.725
All right,
what do you want me to do?

09:53.759 --> 09:56.195
I don't know what to do.

09:56.227 --> 09:58.329
I-I can't get you
to stick up for yourself.

09:58.363 --> 09:59.965
I can't get you
to meet friends.

09:59.998 --> 10:01.867
I can't get you to take off
that stupid mask.

10:01.899 --> 10:03.802
What do you want me to do?
Help me out.

10:03.835 --> 10:05.304
Mom wouldn't make me go
to this school.

10:05.336 --> 10:06.771
What?

10:06.804 --> 10:08.907
- Mom...
- Mom?

10:10.908 --> 10:13.111
Yeah, well, if she cared
so much about you,

10:13.144 --> 10:14.145
why'd she leave?

10:19.017 --> 10:21.820
I'm sorry.

10:21.852 --> 10:25.323
Paul, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that, okay?

10:25.356 --> 10:27.192
- I didn't mean that. Come on, let's eat.
- Don't touch me.

10:29.094 --> 10:31.930
Paul, I said I was sor...
Ow!

10:31.962 --> 10:33.399
You just bit me!

10:48.480 --> 10:49.947
Paul?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.183
Paul, open up. Come on.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.718
Come on, pal.

10:53.751 --> 10:55.687
I'm sorry, okay?
I said I was sorry.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.755
I don't want to talk
about her anymore, okay?

10:57.788 --> 10:59.057
I'm sorry I said that, but...

11:00.725 --> 11:02.126
...I don't want
to talk about her,

11:02.159 --> 11:03.961
and I don't think
you should think about her.

11:15.273 --> 11:17.043
Paul, please open the door?

11:25.317 --> 11:27.086
There are some...

11:27.119 --> 11:29.754
There are some things that
I've always wanted to ask you.

11:32.256 --> 11:35.393
You were there
when I was born, obviously.

11:37.028 --> 11:39.031
And then you ran away.

11:40.331 --> 11:42.367
Was it easy?

11:44.503 --> 11:46.706
Did it hurt?

11:51.042 --> 11:53.045

Make yourself at home.

14:57.729 --> 14:59.364
Ants.

14:59.397 --> 15:01.700
You got to watch out.

15:01.732 --> 15:04.335
You stare at 'em long enough,
it starts to feel

15:04.369 --> 15:07.406
like they're crawling around
inside your bloodstream.

15:09.474 --> 15:12.277
- Smoke?
- No. Thank you.

15:12.309 --> 15:14.679

15:14.712 --> 15:17.448
do you like my carnival?

15:17.481 --> 15:19.183
Don't lie.

15:19.216 --> 15:20.619
I see it as it is.

15:20.652 --> 15:22.321
Hmm.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.556
Wasn't always that way.

15:24.589 --> 15:26.325
This little cluster of

15:26.357 --> 15:29.627
tilt-a-whirls
and guess-your-weights.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.496
She was my baby.

15:32.529 --> 15:36.033
Best cotton candy
in the tristate area.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.568
Hmm?

15:37.601 --> 15:39.938
Here's to you.

15:43.741 --> 15:45.743
Ah.

15:45.777 --> 15:48.113
Anyway, you know kids.

15:48.145 --> 15:51.750
Start out so damn cute,
but you come home one day,

15:51.783 --> 15:54.986
you barely even recognize them.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.454
I tell you,

15:56.488 --> 16:01.059
the transitory
entertainment business

16:01.091 --> 16:03.194
just isn't what it used to be.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.730
Makes a man feel...

16:07.599 --> 16:09.267
...very old.

16:13.571 --> 16:15.173
You get my meaning?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.511
I'd like to offer you

16:19.543 --> 16:22.380
a partnership, and with it,

16:22.413 --> 16:25.750
enough money
to get to Pennsylvania

16:25.783 --> 16:27.986
ten times over.

16:35.059 --> 16:37.061
What would I have to do?

16:37.095 --> 16:38.629
Do?

16:38.663 --> 16:42.167
Just... be yourself.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.302
So what do you say?

16:44.335 --> 16:46.171
Do we have ourselves a deal?

16:55.346 --> 16:56.648
Hi.

16:56.681 --> 16:59.051
Detective Pollok. We spoke?

17:00.652 --> 17:03.155
So take me through
what happened again.

17:03.187 --> 17:04.522
Uh...

17:04.556 --> 17:06.658
Oh, uh, I told you

17:06.691 --> 17:09.094
we had an argument, and, uh...

17:13.230 --> 17:14.633
And he bit me.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.801
- He bit you?
- Yeah.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.604
And then he left.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.377
Oh, uh, that's his hair.
Sorry.

17:27.811 --> 17:30.581
Uh, it's just all over.
It's...

17:30.615 --> 17:32.384
not a big deal.
Excuse me.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.655
Does he bite you often?

17:36.688 --> 17:40.225
No. No, he doesn't.

17:40.258 --> 17:42.561
But he's got a temper.
He was angry?

17:43.862 --> 17:45.564
No, he's a good kid.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.298
But he bit you?

17:48.599 --> 17:51.102
Do you want to see his room?

17:51.135 --> 17:54.405
Do you have any current photos?

17:54.439 --> 17:56.675
No, I don't.

17:56.708 --> 18:00.412
He, uh... he doesn't like
his... picture taken.

18:00.444 --> 18:02.379
Not one?

18:02.413 --> 18:04.415
What teenager doesn't like
his picture taken?

18:04.449 --> 18:06.218
He doesn't.

18:09.287 --> 18:11.155
When do I get the money?

18:11.189 --> 18:13.592
You're an eager one, huh?

18:13.625 --> 18:17.194
First you do the work,
then you get the paycheck.

18:17.228 --> 18:20.731
So, show me what you got.

18:20.765 --> 18:23.168
Take off your shirt.

18:24.769 --> 18:26.371
No.

18:27.538 --> 18:29.840
Well, here's what's...

18:29.874 --> 18:31.675
gonna happen.

18:31.709 --> 18:35.413
There's gonna be a line
of folks out here.

18:35.445 --> 18:38.750
And now,
for the beguiling, bizarre.

18:38.782 --> 18:43.320
Come see the dangerous Dog Boy.

18:43.354 --> 18:46.423
They come in.

18:46.457 --> 18:47.826
They look at you.

18:47.858 --> 18:49.627
You look at them.

18:49.661 --> 18:53.298
Eye contact.
You do your thing.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.766
- What thing?
- The thing where you're you.

18:55.799 --> 19:00.239
Oh, one more thing.
Do you have a nut allergy?

19:02.773 --> 19:05.376
I think
I'll call it "Wolf Mash."

19:05.410 --> 19:10.415
Look, I'm not hiring you
for your sunny disposition.

19:10.448 --> 19:12.951
And last I heard,
you can't buy a bus ticket

19:12.983 --> 19:15.287
with a wallet full
of principles.

19:15.319 --> 19:17.422
There goes Pennsylvania.

19:17.454 --> 19:19.924
The horror.
The horror of this child.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.361
Folks like you and me.

19:23.461 --> 19:25.797
We give the people
what they want.

19:25.829 --> 19:27.731
Come over here.
Come over here!

19:27.765 --> 19:29.901
What they fear.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.570
There's a power in that.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.408
I don't think I want
to do this anymore.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.515
So go home.

19:44.548 --> 19:48.420
Go back
wherever it is you came from.

19:48.452 --> 19:50.454
Get the hell out of here!

19:51.489 --> 19:52.924
Leave!

19:57.428 --> 19:58.763
Get ready

19:58.796 --> 20:00.632
to scream!

20:02.700 --> 20:05.737
Only five dollars.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.506
The horror of this child!

20:11.509 --> 20:14.378
Attaboy.

20:23.887 --> 20:25.890
Clowns!

20:26.891 --> 20:29.427
Tonight...

20:29.460 --> 20:30.862
we dance!

20:30.894 --> 20:33.397
Ha-ha! Yes!

20:36.901 --> 20:39.971
Hey, drink up, you...

20:40.003 --> 20:41.472
marauders...

20:41.506 --> 20:43.041
pirates.

20:43.074 --> 20:47.379
I'd say that we had
a damn productive day, huh?

20:47.412 --> 20:50.281
Yeah!

20:50.315 --> 20:51.682
Where's my money?

20:51.715 --> 20:54.418
Whoa, fella!

20:54.451 --> 20:56.621
So you had a hard day
at the office.

20:56.653 --> 20:59.758
I see no reason
why we should terminate

20:59.790 --> 21:02.326
our working relationship.

21:02.359 --> 21:04.561
Do you?

21:04.595 --> 21:06.664
- The money.
- Patience, boy.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.733
This is not a one-shot deal.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.669
We're just getting started.

21:10.701 --> 21:12.804
Why don't you hop
on this sucker?

21:12.836 --> 21:14.538
- Give it a spin.
- Yeah. - Come on.

21:14.571 --> 21:16.707
Join the family.

21:16.740 --> 21:20.478
Let's ride!

21:20.510 --> 21:22.980
Come on, boy with no name!

21:23.013 --> 21:24.415
Have some fun!

21:24.449 --> 21:26.051
Come on!

21:26.084 --> 21:27.585
Let your hair down!

21:27.617 --> 21:29.320
Ha-ha!

21:29.354 --> 21:30.922
God, yes!

21:30.954 --> 21:34.525
I wish you could see it
as it once was.

21:34.558 --> 21:36.894
Oh, but we built
something special.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.497
Paradise... paradise!

21:39.529 --> 21:42.567
I close my eyes
and I can still hear

21:42.599 --> 21:45.436
the children's laughter.

21:55.445 --> 21:57.682
Where did it all go?

22:29.113 --> 22:30.815
Get him. Get him!

22:30.847 --> 22:32.884
Violence!

22:36.586 --> 22:38.655
No.

22:38.689 --> 22:42.527
No! Save the Dragon!
Don't let it get to the Dragon!

22:42.559 --> 22:44.995
Put out the fire!

22:45.028 --> 22:48.465
My God, no!

22:48.499 --> 22:50.168
Oh, no!

22:53.703 --> 22:56.875
Did you
ever wonder about who I was?

22:56.907 --> 22:59.844
About what I was capable of?

23:02.579 --> 23:04.883
Or did you just want to get
as far away as possible?

23:07.084 --> 23:09.019
Before I ruined your life, too.

23:36.713 --> 23:39.583
Or did I mean anything
to you at all?

23:57.902 --> 23:59.538
Okay.

24:18.788 --> 24:21.492
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Detective Pollok.

24:21.526 --> 24:24.028
- Have some news about your son.
- Is he okay?

24:24.060 --> 24:26.630
He apparently
burned down a carnival.

24:26.663 --> 24:28.967
Does he have any past
experience with arson?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.069
No, no, h-he doesn't have
any experience with that.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.605
I'm just gonna tell you...
now that I know

24:33.637 --> 24:34.705
he's a potential threat...

24:34.739 --> 24:35.773
What do you mean?

24:35.806 --> 24:37.141
He's not a potential threat.

24:37.173 --> 24:39.510
He's a 13-year-old boy.

24:39.544 --> 24:42.780
13-year-olds can do
terrible things.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.215
Look, I'll be in touch, okay?

24:44.248 --> 24:45.783
Uh-huh.

24:45.816 --> 24:47.885
Okay. Thank you.

she's gonna beat
the crap out of you.

28:06.483 --> 28:09.220

sorry for you or something?

28:32.143 --> 28:34.112
Aristiana.

28:35.479 --> 28:37.048
That's a stupid name.

28:38.115 --> 28:39.383
Wait. Wait, wait.

28:39.415 --> 28:40.917
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:40.951 --> 28:42.819
I'm sorry. It's not...

28:42.853 --> 28:44.923
It's not that stupid.

28:46.523 --> 28:49.226
You don't know how to be nice
to people, do you?

28:51.060 --> 28:53.029
Just because you look like that

28:53.063 --> 28:55.500
doesn't give you permission
to be a dick.

28:55.532 --> 28:58.034
I'm sorry.

29:01.238 --> 29:02.807
So, what,

29:02.839 --> 29:05.041
are you on the run

29:05.075 --> 29:07.178
No.

29:07.211 --> 29:10.248
Just trying to get
to Pennsylvania.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.215
Then why is your hair
like that?

29:12.249 --> 29:14.251

29:30.034 --> 29:32.137
my mom cut off
all my hair last night.

29:36.006 --> 29:38.276
That sucks.

29:38.308 --> 29:41.178
Yeah. Um...

29:41.211 --> 29:43.314
So, I have a show tonight,

29:45.950 --> 29:49.386

29:49.420 --> 29:51.989

you're with Aristiana.

- I'm with Aristiana.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.399
I can't hear you.

31:41.432 --> 31:42.901
He's with Aristiana!

31:44.201 --> 31:46.537
And I am, too.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.346
What is this?

31:57.381 --> 31:59.216
It's a potion, man.

31:59.249 --> 32:01.152
It's made of magic.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.120
I'm not old enough.

32:04.153 --> 32:07.325
Please. You're never
"not old enough" for anything.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.970
Do you smoke?

32:26.109 --> 32:29.112
So, how do you know Aristiana?

32:29.145 --> 32:32.115
I, um... I slept
in her doghouse last night.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.620

35:03.166 --> 35:05.268
That's cool.

35:05.302 --> 35:07.671
But you-you...
I mean, you're really...

35:07.704 --> 35:09.273
- Paul!
- You're...

35:10.740 --> 35:12.675
You really are on the lam.

35:12.708 --> 35:14.577
- Told you.
- Well, looks like

35:14.610 --> 35:16.614
we pretty much have
to do something illegal.

35:17.947 --> 35:20.384
What? Huh?

35:37.733 --> 35:40.403
Hey.

35:40.436 --> 35:41.739
Take it off.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.710
Come on.

35:52.682 --> 35:54.684
Do you want
to hear something cool?

35:55.686 --> 35:57.454
Uh, yeah.

35:57.487 --> 35:59.690
I can breathe underwater.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.891
No, you can't.

36:01.925 --> 36:04.961
Yes, I can. I know
because when I was younger,

36:04.994 --> 36:06.864
I tried to drown myself,
and I couldn't.

36:53.543 --> 36:55.546
Why did...?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.583
Why did you do that?

36:59.615 --> 37:01.784
Earlier?

37:01.818 --> 37:03.821
Do what?

37:05.021 --> 37:07.224
The...

37:10.059 --> 37:12.262
Because I wanted to.

37:15.565 --> 37:17.534
Yeah, but...

37:17.567 --> 37:19.003
look at me.

37:20.503 --> 37:22.505
Yeah?

37:26.009 --> 37:28.278
Just...

37:29.880 --> 37:31.882
I don't understand.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.719
Paul...

37:35.751 --> 37:37.755
you're not ugly.

37:39.755 --> 37:41.759
You don't have to lie to me.

37:45.929 --> 37:47.932
Do you see these?

37:50.599 --> 37:53.737
I got these a year ago when
I punched a mirror in half.

37:56.739 --> 37:58.808
I've been beautiful ever since.

38:24.634 --> 38:27.036
You want to hear a secret?

38:27.070 --> 38:28.939
Sure.

38:29.972 --> 38:32.576
I'm gonna kill my mother.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.713
- You are?
- Yeah.

38:35.746 --> 38:38.481
I decided it last night
after she cut my hair.

38:38.514 --> 38:40.416
I'm gonna wait
till she's sleeping

38:40.449 --> 38:42.485
and bash her brains out
with a rock.

38:42.518 --> 38:44.487
You shouldn't do that.

38:45.521 --> 38:48.358
You should poison her.

38:48.391 --> 38:50.393
Easier.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.365
Or you could just run away
like I did, you know?

38:55.398 --> 38:57.934
Why are you going
to Pennsylvania anyway?

38:57.967 --> 39:00.971
My mom is there.

39:01.003 --> 39:03.074
Never met her before.

39:04.106 --> 39:06.076
Like, ever?

39:06.108 --> 39:09.612
Yeah, pretty much.

39:10.713 --> 39:12.750
She sent me this.

39:18.822 --> 39:20.825
112 Sapphire Street.

39:22.425 --> 39:23.594
Kevin?

39:23.626 --> 39:26.163
Shh. Shh.

39:26.195 --> 39:27.663
Kevin, are you in there?

39:27.697 --> 39:29.932
Kevin? Kevin?

39:29.965 --> 39:31.868
Oh, my God. What is this?

39:31.902 --> 39:33.936
Get over here!
What are you...?

39:33.969 --> 39:35.905
- Mom!
- What's going on here?! Oh, my God.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.408
- What the hell are you?!
- Mom, no, please stop!

39:38.442 --> 39:39.710
- Answer me. What are you doing?
- Mom!

39:39.742 --> 39:41.445
What are you doing to my son?!

39:41.478 --> 39:43.981
What did you do to him?

39:44.014 --> 39:46.849
- Paul, we have to go.
- Kevin!

39:46.882 --> 39:48.885
Kevin!

39:59.795 --> 40:02.899
Dude, bar's closed.

40:02.932 --> 40:05.536

40:10.639 --> 40:11.908
Excuse me?

40:13.943 --> 40:18.081
I hate to do this, but I have
something in my shoe.

40:19.615 --> 40:22.652
And it's just
been bothering me...

40:24.621 --> 40:26.624

Damn, gosh.

40:35.264 --> 40:37.733

- Who are you?

40:37.766 --> 40:39.769
My drink?

40:45.842 --> 40:48.979
You seen a boy and a dog?

40:49.012 --> 40:52.950

- A boy and a dog.

40:52.983 --> 40:55.219

what you're talking about.

Oh, and, um,
something you should know,

42:13.630 --> 42:17.099
- don't ask about her eye.
- What happened to her eye?

42:17.132 --> 42:18.968
There are rumors
that her dad scooped it

42:19.001 --> 42:22.038
- out of her face with a spork.
- A spork?

42:22.072 --> 42:23.307
Yeah, or that she did it
herself

42:23.340 --> 42:24.975
because she was tired of people

42:25.007 --> 42:26.809
calling her pretty, or that...

three hours?

42:52.802 --> 42:54.104

42:54.137 --> 42:55.205

42:55.237 --> 42:57.607

- Why?

with a piece of wood
last night,

and I'd really like
to make some purchases

43:03.278 --> 43:06.650
- to take my mind off of it.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

43:06.682 --> 43:09.052

44:31.768 --> 44:34.204
You told me you stopped
robbing convenience stores.

44:34.237 --> 44:36.072
I did. Because gas stations
have way more money.

44:36.106 --> 44:39.342

44:39.375 --> 44:40.844

a scrawny little geek

48:48.291 --> 48:51.594
with terrible clothes
and no personality.

48:51.626 --> 48:54.130
She used to not speak to anyone
and then go onstage

48:54.163 --> 48:56.699
and read this awful poetry
about horses.

48:58.701 --> 49:01.505
Don't be mean to her.

49:08.643 --> 49:10.179

49:10.213 --> 49:12.983

all gonna end in tears.

Well, it's, um...

49:15.650 --> 49:18.187
At least it's fun, right?

49:18.221 --> 49:20.356
It's not really that fun.

49:20.389 --> 49:23.659
Then why do you do it?

49:23.693 --> 49:27.097
It's probably all my
self-destructive tendencies.

49:31.434 --> 49:33.570
Wouldn't be so bad, you know.

49:33.603 --> 49:35.739
- What?
- Jail.

49:36.773 --> 49:38.274
I mean, in some jails,

49:38.306 --> 49:40.376
I hear they have
an ice cream station.

49:40.409 --> 49:43.078

49:43.112 --> 49:45.382
Nice beds.

49:45.414 --> 49:47.217

Not really.

49:51.586 --> 49:53.255

49:53.289 --> 49:56.493

about my house before?

You've already been
to my house.

50:02.197 --> 50:04.701
My house is the car, Paul.

50:04.733 --> 50:06.735
Oh.

50:06.768 --> 50:09.005
Chug.

50:14.443 --> 50:17.014
So, what do you want
to do next?

50:22.851 --> 50:24.820
Happy birthday!

50:52.414 --> 50:55.284
This is crazy, huh?

50:56.452 --> 50:58.789
I can't believe
it's all for me.

51:02.625 --> 51:04.327
Why aren't you down there?

51:06.528 --> 51:09.199
It's gonna take forever
to grow back.

51:10.365 --> 51:12.134
I'm sorry.

51:12.168 --> 51:14.170
I mean,
I don't know why we care

51:14.202 --> 51:15.505
so much about hair anyway.

51:15.538 --> 51:17.373
I mean, it's just, like,
these tentacles

51:17.405 --> 51:21.177
that grow out of our skulls,
but...

51:21.210 --> 51:23.179
When I was little,
I used to go in the bathroom

51:23.211 --> 51:25.382
and wrap a towel
around my head, so...

51:27.282 --> 51:29.418
...it's got to mean something.

51:33.755 --> 51:35.257
Are you mad at me?

51:36.659 --> 51:39.695
Well, you did rob, like,
four different stores.

51:39.728 --> 51:41.530
- Yeah.
- But...

51:41.563 --> 51:44.400
I'm glad you get to have
your own party.

51:45.601 --> 51:47.503
Having fun?

51:47.536 --> 51:51.173
Yeah. I have fireworks.

51:51.206 --> 51:52.875
And you don't know
what direction they went in?

51:52.909 --> 51:54.544
I really have no idea.

51:56.311 --> 51:57.547
Showtime, y'all!

52:07.956 --> 52:11.860
God bless
all the stupid children.

52:11.893 --> 52:16.598
I want to dedicate this night
to Paul on his...

52:16.632 --> 52:18.367
How old are you, Paul?

52:18.400 --> 52:19.568
Thirteen.

52:19.601 --> 52:22.271
On his 13th birthday!

52:28.411 --> 52:30.346
Happy birthday.

52:30.378 --> 52:32.414
Make a wish.

52:50.766 --> 52:53.470
- Stop! Police!
- This way! Come on!

53:01.677 --> 53:04.381
Goddamn it, Rose.

53:16.358 --> 53:17.693
Wait.

53:20.929 --> 53:23.332
- What... Why?
- Oh, I lied.

53:23.365 --> 53:24.766
That's definitely not
a water gun.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.469
Shit.

53:26.501 --> 53:29.005
- I think this is my time to punch out.
- What?

53:29.038 --> 53:31.773
- Come on. Getting arrested?
- No, no, no.

53:31.806 --> 53:34.443
We're sticking together
because, um,

53:34.476 --> 53:37.246
- you made me a party, and you can't...
- Paul. Go.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.349
- We should.
- What...?

53:39.382 --> 53:42.652
Wait, wait, wait, Rose, Rose.

53:42.684 --> 53:44.788
What happened to your eye?

53:47.322 --> 53:49.326
Lazy eye.

53:56.565 --> 53:59.235
When you stopped running...

54:00.503 --> 54:03.573
...did you like
where you ended up?

54:07.677 --> 54:10.012
Did you start a new family?

54:13.481 --> 54:15.818
Did you tell 'em about us?

54:31.032 --> 54:33.702
So, here it is as I see it.

54:33.735 --> 54:35.570
We don't have any food,

54:35.603 --> 54:38.573
we're being chased
by the police,

54:38.606 --> 54:40.876
and I left
my nail polish behind.

54:42.878 --> 54:47.417
So... what do we do now?

54:50.418 --> 54:52.422
I know.

55:12.907 --> 55:14.009

Hi.

58:56.331 --> 58:59.268
- Hello?
- Uh, I'm sorry to bother you. I just...

59:00.802 --> 59:02.771
I kind of got
a weird question for you.

59:02.804 --> 59:04.973
I-I just wanted to know
if this wrapping paper,

59:05.007 --> 59:07.643
does it look familiar to you?

59:07.675 --> 59:08.978
- No.
- My son is missing,

59:09.010 --> 59:10.679
and he got this package.

59:10.713 --> 59:13.249
Uh, and you have the same...

59:13.282 --> 59:15.251
I don't know what
you're talking about.

59:20.054 --> 59:22.657
Wait a minute. Hey.

59:22.690 --> 59:24.192
I know you.

59:24.226 --> 59:26.663
From the carnival.

59:27.695 --> 59:28.864
Percy?

59:31.900 --> 59:33.735
What are you gonna
do when you see her?

59:33.768 --> 59:36.204
Uh, I guess
I'll just figure it out

59:36.237 --> 59:37.606
when I get there.

59:39.942 --> 59:41.945
Here it is.

59:45.014 --> 59:47.884
Paul, are you sure this is it?

59:50.219 --> 59:53.356
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it looks kind of...

59:53.389 --> 59:56.325
Uh... Okay, um...

59:56.358 --> 1:00:01.197
Is it okay if, um...
you stay out here?

1:00:01.230 --> 1:00:03.733
I think I just...

1:00:03.766 --> 1:00:05.901
think I need to do this alone,
you know?

1:00:05.934 --> 1:00:08.805
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

1:00:11.306 --> 1:00:14.177
Okay.

1:00:23.152 --> 1:00:25.153
Hello?

1:00:32.126 --> 1:00:34.130
Hello?

1:01:02.157 --> 1:01:04.861
Where is he?

1:01:05.893 --> 1:01:07.128
Where the hell's my son?

1:01:07.161 --> 1:01:09.164
I don't know.

1:01:09.197 --> 1:01:11.033
What's this?

1:01:12.166 --> 1:01:14.036
It was just a prank.

1:01:46.501 --> 1:01:48.371
Paul.

1:01:50.105 --> 1:01:52.108
You okay?

1:01:57.012 --> 1:01:59.849
It was all a joke.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:03.018
She didn't want to meet me.
She never did. Sh...

1:02:03.050 --> 1:02:05.353
- Paul, let's go outside.
- No, I-I'm...

1:02:05.387 --> 1:02:07.923
I'm not a regular kid. I'm...

1:02:07.956 --> 1:02:11.260
I'm not a-a hero.
I'm-I'm-I'm a freak.

1:02:11.293 --> 1:02:12.894
Paul, you can't say that
about yourself.

1:02:12.927 --> 1:02:15.029
No, we have to be honest
with ourselves, okay?

1:02:15.063 --> 1:02:16.766
We're never honest
with ourselves.

1:02:16.798 --> 1:02:19.335
- I think I'm very honest...
- No, you're not, okay?

1:02:19.367 --> 1:02:21.737
I'm not a hero, and you're not
a girl. You're-you're a boy.

1:02:26.007 --> 1:02:28.343
And nothing we can do
will ever change that.

1:02:31.813 --> 1:02:33.782
You're right.

1:02:33.815 --> 1:02:36.184
You're not a hero.

1:03:25.567 --> 1:03:29.304
Hey there, boy with no name.

1:03:31.039 --> 1:03:34.510
You know, I've been thinking.

1:03:34.543 --> 1:03:39.448
What is it you're trying
to repent for?

1:03:40.481 --> 1:03:42.150
What?

1:03:42.184 --> 1:03:44.586
I'm sure this has been fun,

1:03:44.619 --> 1:03:47.623
running around,
playing pretend,

1:03:47.655 --> 1:03:51.025
looking for, what,
validation, hmm?

1:03:51.059 --> 1:03:52.995
If you try to hurt me again,
I'll burn down more than...

1:03:53.027 --> 1:03:55.330
Don't you dare talk
about burning!

1:04:01.168 --> 1:04:03.071
My apologies.

1:04:04.405 --> 1:04:09.378
What I should be saying is:
congratulations.

1:04:09.411 --> 1:04:14.083
Looks like you finally got
where you needed to be.

1:04:14.115 --> 1:04:17.286
But lest you forget,
boy with no name,

1:04:17.318 --> 1:04:21.190
you've still got a contract
to hold up.

1:04:40.608 --> 1:04:41.610
Silence!

1:04:49.617 --> 1:04:55.123
But I think you're not facing
the reality of your situation.

1:04:56.291 --> 1:04:59.295
No more fairy tales.

1:05:00.695 --> 1:05:04.432
No more make-believe.

1:05:05.733 --> 1:05:10.172
You have a disfiguring
medical condition...

1:05:16.110 --> 1:05:18.579
...that disturbs
the people around you.

1:05:18.612 --> 1:05:21.416
You think you can have a job?

1:05:22.451 --> 1:05:25.454
A wife? Children?

1:05:26.588 --> 1:05:28.423
All you're good for is

1:05:28.456 --> 1:05:32.460
a long stare
and a weak punch line.

1:05:32.494 --> 1:05:33.495
You heard him!

1:05:34.563 --> 1:05:36.164
Why don't you bark for us?

1:05:36.197 --> 1:05:38.466
Son.

1:05:38.500 --> 1:05:41.336
- Go on, bark!
- You're going to die ugly...

1:05:44.438 --> 1:05:45.740
...and unloved.

1:05:49.478 --> 1:05:51.547
You little bast...

1:05:51.579 --> 1:05:52.981
Police!

1:06:33.521 --> 1:06:35.356
Hey.

1:06:35.389 --> 1:06:38.292
Tea.

1:06:38.326 --> 1:06:41.295
How'd you guys find me?

1:06:41.329 --> 1:06:43.565
It was your father, actually.

1:06:43.597 --> 1:06:45.266
Really?

1:06:46.835 --> 1:06:49.038
Uh, am I going to jail, or...?

1:06:49.070 --> 1:06:51.139
Let's take that
one step at a time.

1:06:55.277 --> 1:06:57.545
Where is he?

1:06:57.579 --> 1:06:59.248
Paul.

1:07:00.715 --> 1:07:03.251
You don't run. When you get
nervous, you don't run.

1:07:03.284 --> 1:07:05.520
How many times
do we have to go over this?

1:07:07.422 --> 1:07:09.257
I'll give you a minute.

1:07:12.561 --> 1:07:14.096
I'm sorry.

1:07:16.398 --> 1:07:19.601
No, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:07:19.634 --> 1:07:21.536
Forget the school, okay?

1:07:21.570 --> 1:07:24.373
Forget the school.
It was a stupid idea.

1:07:25.539 --> 1:07:28.277
Okay?

1:07:28.309 --> 1:07:29.478
Yeah.

1:07:31.679 --> 1:07:34.715
I'm trying, pal.

1:07:34.748 --> 1:07:37.085
I'm trying as hard as I can.

1:07:37.119 --> 1:07:40.588
- I know. I'm trying, too.
- Yeah.

1:07:40.621 --> 1:07:42.590
I know you are.

1:07:42.623 --> 1:07:44.358
Where's your mask?

1:07:44.391 --> 1:07:46.861
- I lost it.
- Okay. That's okay.

1:07:46.894 --> 1:07:49.230
It doesn't matter.
We'll get you a new one.

1:07:49.264 --> 1:07:53.367
I was thinking maybe...
maybe it'd be easier

1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:55.403
- if I wore one, too, so we...
- No. No, Dad,

1:07:55.436 --> 1:07:58.106
it's... it's fine.

1:08:02.443 --> 1:08:04.880
Okay.

1:08:06.614 --> 1:08:07.782
Wow.

1:08:10.152 --> 1:08:12.487
You went to go find your mom.

1:08:14.688 --> 1:08:17.592
- How'd you know that?
- That... it doesn't matter.

1:08:18.627 --> 1:08:20.830
You still want to find her?

1:08:22.430 --> 1:08:25.267
You told me you didn't know
where she lived.

1:08:48.856 --> 1:08:51.659
- Okay.
- This is it?

1:08:51.693 --> 1:08:52.862
Yeah.

1:08:54.261 --> 1:08:57.231
Have you ever been in there?

1:08:57.265 --> 1:08:59.334
No. No.

1:08:59.367 --> 1:09:02.503
I mean, I've been through
her, uh, garbage a few times.

1:09:02.537 --> 1:09:06.375
Not in, like, a creepy sense
but in a professional way.

1:09:08.443 --> 1:09:11.713
It's funny, I always thought
she lived in, like...

1:09:11.746 --> 1:09:13.715
Paris or something.

1:09:13.747 --> 1:09:15.750
Paris. Nope.

1:09:18.552 --> 1:09:20.689
Are you sure you don't want me
to go in there with you?

1:09:20.721 --> 1:09:23.791
No. I'm okay.

1:09:23.824 --> 1:09:25.827
Okay.

1:09:36.371 --> 1:09:38.774
Paul, wait.

1:09:38.806 --> 1:09:40.975
I don't know what
it's gonna be like in there,

1:09:41.009 --> 1:09:44.246
okay, so I don't think you
should expect it go great.

1:09:44.279 --> 1:09:46.715
I know, Dad.

1:09:55.489 --> 1:09:57.358
And the last thing to ask,

1:09:57.391 --> 1:09:58.793
I guess...

1:10:05.899 --> 1:10:09.403
...did you ever wonder
if I would find you?

1:10:09.436 --> 1:10:11.439
Hi.

1:10:16.645 --> 1:10:18.647
Hello.

1:10:21.983 --> 1:10:26.654
I can get you, um,
some water, or, like, um...

1:10:26.688 --> 1:10:28.323
Water?

1:10:41.435 --> 1:10:43.904
I always thought
you lived in a mansion,

1:10:43.938 --> 1:10:47.643
with kids who played
the flute or the cello.

1:10:55.949 --> 1:10:57.818
Did you want me
to have a nice house

1:10:57.851 --> 1:11:00.822
so you could come
and stay with me?

1:11:00.854 --> 1:11:04.592
No, it just made it easier
to dislike you.

1:11:08.529 --> 1:11:13.034
Um, sorry to disappoint.

1:11:16.805 --> 1:11:20.643
I don't have a flute.
I have a recorder, I think.

1:11:21.810 --> 1:11:23.512
Do you want it?

1:11:23.545 --> 1:11:26.547
Okay.

1:11:26.581 --> 1:11:28.284
I think it's somewhere
over here.

1:11:34.823 --> 1:11:36.692
Yeah.

1:11:41.762 --> 1:11:44.300
Happy birthday.

1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:48.569
You remembered.

1:11:48.603 --> 1:11:50.605
Yeah.

1:11:52.940 --> 1:11:55.310
I don't know how to play this.

1:11:57.779 --> 1:11:59.614
Here. Want to show you.

1:11:59.646 --> 1:12:03.051
Just, um, put your fingers
over these holes like this.

1:12:16.730 --> 1:12:18.065
You're really bad at that.

1:12:18.099 --> 1:12:21.802
Yeah, let's be
honest, these things...

1:12:21.836 --> 1:12:25.539
sound like shit
no matter what, so...

1:12:25.573 --> 1:12:27.576
Damn it,
I was trying not to swear.

1:12:29.109 --> 1:12:31.512
I'm sorry. It's just...

1:12:44.893 --> 1:12:46.427
It was me.

1:12:50.664 --> 1:12:53.534
I never told your dad, but...

1:12:56.537 --> 1:12:58.706
...this is pretty much
all my fault.

1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:01.743
What do you mean?

1:13:11.586 --> 1:13:13.422
Dad?

1:13:13.454 --> 1:13:14.989
Who's that?

1:13:15.023 --> 1:13:17.926
- It's me.
- Sleeping.

1:13:21.662 --> 1:13:24.532
Remember the person
I told you about last night?

1:13:27.902 --> 1:13:29.904
He's here.

1:13:39.113 --> 1:13:41.516
Well, would you look at that.

1:13:41.548 --> 1:13:45.921
Jen, uh, you mind
leaving us alone for a bit?

1:14:20.121 --> 1:14:23.658
You know, I was awful angry
when she told me about you.

1:14:23.690 --> 1:14:26.661
If I had known before,
I-I would've...

1:14:26.694 --> 1:14:28.830
I mean, I didn't even know
she had a kid.

1:14:28.863 --> 1:14:31.099
You didn't know about me?

1:14:31.131 --> 1:14:34.935
She's always been very, uh...

1:14:34.969 --> 1:14:38.640
It was hard for her,
growing up with me.

1:14:38.672 --> 1:14:41.643
Used to lie and say
that her dad was the guy

1:14:41.676 --> 1:14:44.513
who hosted "Wheel of Fortune."

1:14:44.546 --> 1:14:46.548
Yeah, she pretty much
cut me out of her life

1:14:46.581 --> 1:14:48.884
for something like 25 years.

1:14:48.917 --> 1:14:51.553
When did she start
talking to you again?

1:14:51.586 --> 1:14:54.289
Uh, about 13 years ago.

1:14:54.322 --> 1:14:56.824
- Hmm.
- And, you know, it's...

1:14:56.858 --> 1:15:00.662
it's really easy
to blame anyone for anything.

1:15:00.694 --> 1:15:04.198
But when you get to be my age,

1:15:04.231 --> 1:15:07.202
it all just seems sort of...

1:15:08.735 --> 1:15:10.905
So, what kind of names
have they called you?

1:15:10.939 --> 1:15:13.208
- What do you mean?
- Come on. I want to see

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.645
if they've gotten any more
creative since I was a kid.

1:15:16.677 --> 1:15:18.813
Dogface. You ever get Dogface?

1:15:18.845 --> 1:15:20.981
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's a staple.

1:15:21.015 --> 1:15:23.318
- How about Furball?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1:15:23.350 --> 1:15:26.820
Um, uh, Hairy Potter.

1:15:26.854 --> 1:15:28.590
- You mean, l-like the...
- Yeah.

1:15:28.622 --> 1:15:30.157
With an "I," yeah.

1:15:30.190 --> 1:15:31.760
Hey, that ain't half bad.

1:15:34.929 --> 1:15:36.730
You ever try to cut it off?

1:15:36.764 --> 1:15:39.067
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- But it came back, right?

1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:40.936
- Yeah, twice as thick, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:15:40.969 --> 1:15:43.270
- Mm-hmm.
- Once, I tried to set it on fire.

1:15:43.304 --> 1:15:46.807
- Really?
- Yeah, I got too scared at the last second.

1:15:46.841 --> 1:15:50.111
But I still managed
to burn down a shed.

1:15:50.144 --> 1:15:53.981
Wow. I tried Nair.

1:16:02.823 --> 1:16:06.728
This is a weird question,
but...

1:16:08.930 --> 1:16:10.932
How hard is it?

1:16:11.966 --> 1:16:13.134
What do you mean?

1:16:13.167 --> 1:16:14.736
I mean...

1:16:16.738 --> 1:16:19.908
...how hard will it be?

1:16:22.176 --> 1:16:25.780
I'm not gonna lie,
it's gonna be tough.

1:16:25.813 --> 1:16:29.016
You got any friends?

1:16:29.050 --> 1:16:30.885
- Yeah.
- Well, then,

1:16:30.917 --> 1:16:33.354
you're a heck of a lot
further along then I was.

1:16:33.387 --> 1:16:35.055
I mean, when I was your age,

1:16:35.088 --> 1:16:37.792
I was still wearing a sack
over my head.

1:16:41.061 --> 1:16:45.367
So, no, it's never
gonna be truly easy.

1:16:45.399 --> 1:16:48.235
But I guess I'd just say this:

1:16:48.269 --> 1:16:51.940
the world is gonna be mean
to us no matter what we do.

1:16:51.972 --> 1:16:56.043
So we can't afford
to be mean to ourselves.

1:17:00.148 --> 1:17:03.952
You know,
your mom's got this, uh,

1:17:03.984 --> 1:17:06.954
art studio thing.

1:17:06.988 --> 1:17:10.958
She'd been working on this
project for quite a while.

1:17:10.992 --> 1:17:15.663
I always thought
that it was connected to me.

1:17:15.697 --> 1:17:19.734
But now
I don't think that anymore.

1:18:33.807 --> 1:18:36.243
You guys have
a good conversation?

1:18:36.277 --> 1:18:37.878
Yeah.

1:18:43.417 --> 1:18:46.088
Did he say anything bad
about me?

1:18:48.221 --> 1:18:50.358
- Uh...
- He can.

1:18:50.390 --> 1:18:52.393
He should, because...

1:18:52.426 --> 1:18:55.963
I know how he feels about me,
and he's not wrong.

1:18:58.565 --> 1:19:01.068
But when I first saw your face

1:19:01.101 --> 1:19:04.838
and I knew what your life
was gonna be like,

1:19:04.872 --> 1:19:09.778
I just... I couldn't.

1:19:09.810 --> 1:19:13.046
I couldn't do that.

1:19:13.079 --> 1:19:15.550
If you want to be angry at me,
it's okay.

1:19:15.582 --> 1:19:18.051
If I were you, I'd be angry.

1:19:18.085 --> 1:19:20.855
- Do you want me to yell at you, or something?
- Yes.

1:19:22.088 --> 1:19:25.493
No. I don't know. Maybe.

1:19:31.431 --> 1:19:34.435
I had all these questions
for you.

1:19:39.606 --> 1:19:41.909
You're a good artist.

1:19:44.345 --> 1:19:46.815
You're really good at drawing.

1:19:52.319 --> 1:19:55.189
- Well, can I give you a hug?
- No.

1:20:00.161 --> 1:20:02.898
Can I take the recorder home?

1:20:05.065 --> 1:20:06.568
Yeah.

1:20:13.006 --> 1:20:14.942
Thank you.

1:20:27.889 --> 1:20:30.190
Hey.

1:20:30.224 --> 1:20:32.894
Oh, look at that...
a dust bunny.

1:20:32.926 --> 1:20:34.862
Can you...?

1:20:34.895 --> 1:20:36.463
Do you think we could go talk?

1:20:41.335 --> 1:20:43.570
Yeah.

1:20:44.639 --> 1:20:46.541
Listen, I'm sorry.

1:20:46.573 --> 1:20:49.643
I'm really, really sorry about
what I said, and I was just...

1:20:49.676 --> 1:20:51.179
It's fine.

1:20:51.212 --> 1:20:52.280
I'm over it.

1:20:54.047 --> 1:20:55.382
You don't have to pretend.

1:20:55.416 --> 1:20:57.150
I'm not pretending.

1:20:57.184 --> 1:21:00.488
You think I'm not used
to people being terrible to me?

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:02.256
Think you're special?

1:21:02.289 --> 1:21:03.557
Aristiana...

1:21:03.591 --> 1:21:06.160
I mean, chances are,
20 years from now,

1:21:06.193 --> 1:21:09.197
I'll either be an alcoholic
or beaten to death.

1:21:10.398 --> 1:21:12.300
Come on, I got something
to show you.

1:21:16.970 --> 1:21:18.906
You know, I...
I meant what I said.

1:21:18.939 --> 1:21:21.541
I'm really sorry.

1:21:21.574 --> 1:21:24.511
So, how are things
with your mom?

1:21:24.545 --> 1:21:27.114
I'm staying with my aunt
for a while.

1:21:28.615 --> 1:21:31.351
You know,
it's not perfect, but...

1:21:31.385 --> 1:21:34.322
it's getting better.

1:21:37.057 --> 1:21:39.527
I met my mom today.

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:42.096
Really?

1:21:42.128 --> 1:21:44.097
Yeah.

1:21:44.131 --> 1:21:46.134
How was it?

1:21:48.269 --> 1:21:50.271
It was...

1:21:51.604 --> 1:21:53.173
...really weird.

1:21:53.207 --> 1:21:54.576
I don't know...

1:21:55.609 --> 1:21:57.612
I'm sorry, Paul.

1:22:18.099 --> 1:22:20.068
Can I tell you something?

1:22:20.100 --> 1:22:22.103
Yeah.

1:22:24.637 --> 1:22:27.175
I'm pretty sure you're the most
amazing girl I've ever met.

1:22:30.144 --> 1:22:32.113
Yeah, I'm...

1:22:32.145 --> 1:22:34.148
I'm pretty sure I am, too.

1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:43.190
You think we'll still be
friends in 20 years?

1:22:43.224 --> 1:22:46.628
In 20 years, I think the whole
world might be underwater.

1:22:49.497 --> 1:22:52.066
But, uh... yeah.

1:22:52.099 --> 1:22:54.202
