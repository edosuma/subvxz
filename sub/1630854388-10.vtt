WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:08.800
You can't. There's no room.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.802
No, come on, I can get one more.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.179
-Ooh!

00:13.263 --> 00:14.514
Wow, you're a genius.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.726
Just looking out for you and the business.

00:17.809 --> 00:21.604
You spent all this money on everything,
might as well display it.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.815
You gotta spend money to make money.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.610
Plus it's not every day you get to put up
an elf peeing on the naughty list.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.238
<i>Reporting for Channel 12,</i>
<i>this is Remington Alexander</i>

00:30.321 --> 00:31.906
<i>-back from vacation.</i>
-Finally.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.201
<i>Today's top story</i>
<i>is the impending solar storm</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:37.871
<i>threatening to knock out the Internet,</i>
<i>cell phone service,</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:39.706
<i>and possibly the power grid.</i>

00:39.789 --> 00:43.126
<i>It incited panic</i>
<i>and caused a rush on essential items...</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:44.711
So much fear mongering.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.590
Maybe, but the solar storm is real.
It's why China built a second sun.

00:48.673 --> 00:52.594
Between the solar storm and the metaverse,
I feel like it's coming out of both ends.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.429
If I'm being totally honest,

00:54.512 --> 00:56.681
I did buy 10 pounds
of loose seeds just in case.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.268
I heard the Internet might go down.
You aren't you worried about your Bitcoin?

01:00.351 --> 01:03.104
I already converted it to Kohl's cash.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.607
Stop. This is Y2K all over again.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.358
They said computers would shut down,

01:07.442 --> 01:09.611
my dad panicked
and printed out all his porn.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.572
Nothing happened except
I had to use the other side of that porn

01:12.655 --> 01:13.990
to print my essay on <i>Gatsby.</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.034
<i>The search for local</i>
<i>Sandwich Hell employee,</i>

01:16.117 --> 01:18.244
<i>Garrett Pennock, has taken a sexy turn--</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:21.039
All right, let's just focus
on the event. Okay?

01:21.122 --> 01:24.209
Someone who survived
the Gumdrop Avalanche once said,

01:24.292 --> 01:27.962
"You must shine on,"
and that someone is Lil' Stevie.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.547
I am confused.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.633
I've explained it so many times.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.552
People aren't renting enough DVDs
to keep the lights on,

01:34.636 --> 01:36.513
so we're pivoting to more special events.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.100
You trick nerds into paying
to meet a washed-up actor.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.436
No, I understand that.
I'm confused about Patrice.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.688
I called her
and she hasn't gotten back to me.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.525
It's been two days,
and now I'm worried that she's mad at me.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.568
She's been like this all morning.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.904
Worried my new best friend is mad?

01:52.987 --> 01:56.032
Yeah, I'm a real monster. Oh, Patrice!

01:57.492 --> 01:59.994
Just me. Found a Christmas bow.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.456
Sorry. You have terrible posture
just like Patrice.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.259
I have never seen
so many people here before.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.970
Except for that one time
someone claimed they saw Bono.

02:17.053 --> 02:17.887
That was me.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.349
Somebody left a pair of tinted sunglasses
on a pumpkin.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.686
I think I finally figured out
how to run this business.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.231
The pre-sales from this event alone
will pay my rent for the next two months,

02:28.314 --> 02:30.900
and a new spatula for the bathroom key.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.902
Never underestimate nostalgia.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.281
Nothing thrills people more
than knowing their memory still works.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.785
So, Lena, I was wondering...

02:41.369 --> 02:44.789
Well, you like me, and I like you...

02:44.873 --> 02:47.083
-I know labels are for losers--

02:47.167 --> 02:51.421
Oh, no. My mom thinks she saw a shoplifter
and she's going to handle things her way.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.089
Sorry, I better get there.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.048
Of course. Right.

02:58.261 --> 03:02.098
Did I tell you that my community
college offers classes at night?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.350
What? Everything's coming up Hannah.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.562
-The world is your oyster.
-I could even major in oysters.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.609
So I have a little secret.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.526
Okay.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.447
Eliza's husband Aaron

03:17.530 --> 03:21.075
is going to re-propose to her
in here tonight.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.453
Really? I thought that marriage
was a little rocky.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.748
Well, that's why I told him
he needs a grand gesture.

03:26.831 --> 03:29.792
Things might be more complicated
than you think.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.671
Trust me, people always come to me
about matters of the heart.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.633
Fine. Aaron came in
to get Eliza's schedule,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.594
and then I think he just told me
because he's bad at small talk.

03:39.677 --> 03:43.556
I might also have news pretty soon
that's gonna blow your mind.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.184
Ooh! Please will you film
the proposal for us.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.897
Ideally, it would be as cinematic as...
<i>Pitch Perfect 2.</i>

03:50.980 --> 03:52.941
Come on. Please.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.819
Eh, might as well have me pitch in
while you can still afford me, Toots.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.112
What? I can't pay.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.907
-No, I know. I was gonna do it for free.
-Okay.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.035
Wow! Oh, my God.
Look at all these weirdos.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.204
It's definitely more Garfield sweatshirts

04:06.287 --> 04:09.332
-than I'm used to in a day.
-All these lives going sideways.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.877
Standing in the cold
for a 25-year-old Christmas movie.

04:13.628 --> 04:17.257
No, I take that back.
They're not weirdos. They're geekers.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.510
-I heard that. You laughed.
-Barely.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.430
-You think I'm funny, don't you?
-Funny adjacent. Okay?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.520
Wow, looks like the North Pole in here.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.147
Except less elf scat.
Huge problem up there.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.149
Oh.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.360
Mistletoe. Could you imagine us kissing?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.237
Like, how weird would that be?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.990
Like, there's you and there's me
and our lips,

04:42.073 --> 04:46.411
and did you know that lips are technically
a mucous membrane and not skin?

04:46.494 --> 04:49.664
Huh, I did not know that or want to.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.250
He's here! Lil' Stevie's here.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.626
-Hey.
-Sorry I'm late.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.379
This dang solar storm stuff
has me screwed up.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.632
Also, I'm an adult now
so you can call me just Stevie.

04:59.716 --> 05:04.345
Just Stevie gets it.
But, guess what else! We sold out.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.265
-Really?
-Wait. You sold out the event?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.852
It's just that I retired from acting.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.521
I haven't been in front of a crowd
in over a decade.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.233
-What if they're here to make fun of me?
-What? No. People love you.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.069
Just do what Lil' Stevie did in the movie

05:20.153 --> 05:22.322
when he danced
in front of the Sugar Plum Fairy.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.991
Just give yourself a big hug
for confidence.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.160
Okay, sure.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.579
We'll go warm up the crowd
while you give yourself that hug.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.497
-I can't wait.
-It'll be awesome.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.790
-Okay.
-I'm so excited.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.625
-It's gonna be so cool.
-Sold out!

05:37.170 --> 05:38.129
Oh, a hug.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.674
Mm!

05:41.758 --> 05:44.510
All right. Who wants to meet Lil' Stevie?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
You don't sound that excited.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.143
That's more like it. Okay.

05:52.226 --> 05:56.147
How about we start
with a little movie trivia contest.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.942
-Winner gets this <i>Truman Show</i> key chain.
-Uh-oh!

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
-Ooh!

06:01.736 --> 06:03.613
All right, first question.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.074
Besides <i>But I'm Too Young to be Santa,</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:10.328
name another movie
directed by Roman Polanski.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.080
-Oh!

06:12.163 --> 06:13.373
-Whoa!

06:13.456 --> 06:14.582
Hi.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.086
-Yeah!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.671
You were supposed to go around.
Not through.

06:20.755 --> 06:21.756
Football!

06:23.132 --> 06:26.677
Uh... Hey, Stevie.
Why don't you say your catchphrase?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.596
Yeah, sure.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.765
Hey, hey, hey.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.558
Did I do that?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.186
-I pity the fool!
-Okay. Stop it.

06:35.269 --> 06:38.648
You're almost pathologically
doing catchphrases of Black characters.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.441
It's "But I'm too young to be Santa."

06:40.525 --> 06:41.984
That's right. Thank you.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.947
But I'm too young to be Santa!

06:49.117 --> 06:51.244
-He's drunk.
-Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

06:51.327 --> 06:52.662
Okay.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.333
Dude, you gotta pull it together.
Hey, no more drinking, okay?

06:57.417 --> 07:01.295
Be normal, and stop telling people
why you were banned from Cameo.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.463
Never.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.132
Ho-ho-ho!

07:04.215 --> 07:07.051
Happy Hanukkah to a child.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.053
What can I do for you?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.222
How are you? Is this your wife?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.808
-I'm messing. I'm busting your balls, kid.
-Okay.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.269
You look like my favorite actress,
Angela Racks.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.647
Whoa, buddy.
Santa just complimented your mom.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.482
-Pretty cool.
-Yeah, he did.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.445
Angela Racks was a porn star in the '70s.
She invented the modern-day gangbang.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.823
She was a true pioneer.
You forgot your DVD. Ah!

07:28.906 --> 07:30.032
-Okay, no.
-Damn it!

07:30.116 --> 07:32.577
He meant "corn" star. She did commercials

07:32.660 --> 07:34.912
-for the Iowa Department of Agriculture.
-Goodbye.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.207
Who doesn't call shucking corn
with your friends a gangbang?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.334
Me, Santa doesn't.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.296
We reduced the signed DVDs to 20 bucks.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.755
You can't leave empty-handed.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.591
That's not the Lil' Stevie I remember.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.176
That man wouldn't race around the globe

07:48.259 --> 07:50.761
to find the cure
for Rudolph's testicular cancer.

07:51.679 --> 07:55.057
I meant pornography,
I don't know what he's talking about.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.936
-Take it.
-Ouch.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.354
It's room temperature.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.065
Oh, wow. Congrats, kid.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.735
You're about to witness
the launch of my Hollywood career.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.820
"The Emerging Filmmakers Fellow--"

08:10.406 --> 08:11.824
I didn't get in.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.868
I can't believe I didn't get in.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.288
That was mine.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.333
Hey, how many refunds have you processed?

08:20.416 --> 08:25.087
Do you want to know the exact number?
Because it might give you a heart attack.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.841
Where'd everybody go?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.010
Everybody left because of you.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.514
Event's canceled.
Please, get the hell out of here.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.559
Well, I would, but I'm pretty drunk.
It's not a moral thing.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.979
It's just, my car has a little tube
you gotta blow into--

08:42.063 --> 08:42.939
Stop talking!

08:43.022 --> 08:44.899
Stop talking.

08:46.984 --> 08:51.364
Uh, hey, you can all still buy food
and rent videos if you want.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.449
No sense coming all this way and--

08:56.452 --> 08:58.079
What the hell is going on?

09:05.753 --> 09:08.047
-Wow.
-Great. The solar storm.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.425
Told you there would be one.
No one ever believes Hannah.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.635
I need a drink.

09:15.137 --> 09:19.267
<i>The solar storm caused Internet</i>
<i>and cell service to crash indefinitely.</i>

09:19.350 --> 09:21.352
<i>Tensions mount as incidents of looting</i>

09:21.435 --> 09:23.813
<i>have been reported</i>
<i>all across Menominee County...</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:25.273
We're the Jingle Bills.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.441
Okay.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.652
Hannah said we could wait in here.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.696
Oh, for Aaron's proposal, right.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.366
Because nothing says "romance"
like a band of lonely stepdads.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.827
Stepdad? I wish.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.038
Are you going to film it?
Hannah says you're the next Nancy Meyers.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.667
That is not a compliment
and I'm not a filmmaker, apparently.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.461
Maybe Hannah should film it herself.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.171
Here's my camera.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.592
Tell her to read the instructions.
It's easy. She got into community college.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.718
That's amazing.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.554
Everyone gets into community college.
Everyone.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.851
The Wi-Fi went out right
as I crossed a river in <i>Oregon Trail--</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:05.104
Bup-bup-bup! Let me introduce you
to the currency of our new world.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.982
-I didn't stock up.
-Of course you didn't.

10:08.065 --> 10:11.152
-That'll be $5 a roll.
-Kayla will you call Patrice for me?

10:11.235 --> 10:14.697
Call her yourself, or better yet,
walk next door and talk to her.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.117
Oh, no. I don't want to seem pushy.
You know how relationships are.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.745
One false move,
this is Sylvia all over again.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.288
I can't lose Patrice.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.415
Can I use your landline?
Cells aren't working.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.709
Can you look up my mom's number?
I don't know it.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.669
Oh, my God. All of you shut up.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.380
-What did I do?
-Will you call Patrice?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.841
-What's a Patrice?
-Have you seen Timmy?

10:33.924 --> 10:36.719
He's probably taking a victory lap,
like at the Daytona 500.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.805
When a car crashes and burns,
it takes a victory lap in flames.

10:39.889 --> 10:40.973
This is serious.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.518
When Timmy gets down on himself,
he really needs someone, usually me,

10:44.602 --> 10:47.396
to bring his spirits up
or he starts spiraling--

10:47.480 --> 10:49.065
I've got toilet paper to sell.

10:50.983 --> 10:54.487
Timmy fails again.
Who am I kidding? I suck at business.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.364
Don't be so hard on yourself.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.368
-And drinking apparently.
-Aw.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.330
You know, when I was a kid,

11:04.413 --> 11:06.749
my mom never put out a ton
of Christmas decorations,

11:06.832 --> 11:11.379
but we did have this one reindeer,
and every year she would put it out

11:11.462 --> 11:14.006
and every year neighborhood kids stole it.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.008
I'd always convince her to buy a new one,

11:16.092 --> 11:18.636
but eventually
she just stopped putting anything out.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.013
Well, those kids sound like assholes.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.933
They were.
But at what point do you just give up?

11:24.558 --> 11:27.937
I kept the last Blockbuster open
after corporate folded.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.189
This store is my reindeer.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.441
Maybe it is.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.237
But what I like most about you
is that you're the type of person

11:36.320 --> 11:38.864
who will never stop
buying another reindeer.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.574
Mm. You mean an idiot?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.493
No, an optimist.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.621
Watch it, nobody calls
my boyfriend an idiot.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.290
Oh, great.
The girl that I like has a boy--

11:49.750 --> 11:53.629
-Are you talking about me?
-Yes, you are my boyfriend.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.303
Hey. Do you remember when you were little
and had colic, we would stay up

12:01.387 --> 12:04.223
and watch <i>Celebrity Grappling</i>
until you fell asleep?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.016
Do I remember being an infant?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.144
So, no.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.105
Anyway, Lil' Stevie was on it.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.149
I didn't recognize him
with the Santa beard,

12:13.232 --> 12:16.736
but he tried to poke Cheech Marin
in the eye with a stick.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.195
How cool is that?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.573
The guy from our show.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.782
It's not our show.

12:21.866 --> 12:22.742
You're just as lame

12:22.825 --> 12:25.453
as the other dorks
that came for Lil' Stevie.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.871
What's up with you?

12:26.954 --> 12:29.790
I thought we were
kind of, sort of getting along again.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.834
Yeah, well. Swing and a miss.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.254
The legend.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.465
The manhole cover himself.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.178
This proposal is going to be so good.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.637
Sure is.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.182
Wait, so you're all actually named Bill?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.727
Yeah, we have to be named Bill to join.
It's tradition.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.522
-My name used to be Tracy.
-I did it.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.274
Hmm.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.197
I think I just designed my first shot.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.954
Thank God I found you.

13:09.038 --> 13:09.872
Oh, hey.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.958
Hey, I know today's been kind of a lot,

13:13.042 --> 13:16.337
and I figured you probably
needed somebody to--

13:16.420 --> 13:18.380
Two tequila and Sprites.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.132
Oh, Lena.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.592
-Hey.
-Hey!

13:22.802 --> 13:24.094
Great.

13:24.178 --> 13:28.098
I was worried that you were here
drinking yourself to death alone.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.937
I fully expected to have to
pick you up off the floor.

13:33.020 --> 13:37.900
But I guess this is a whole new Timmy,

13:37.983 --> 13:39.193
and that's...

13:39.276 --> 13:40.277
that's great.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.323
Eliza, your hair looks fantastic.

13:44.406 --> 13:47.076
Thank you. Yours is hair too.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.084
Yeah! Move forward!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.048
What the hell is going on?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.886
Hey, Blockbuster
carries kids videos, right?

14:05.970 --> 14:06.846
I'm desperate.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.556
Yeah, of course, games too.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.724
Oh, my God!
Streaming services are down.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.270
The solar storm knocked out the Internet,
without it, people are gonna need--

14:14.353 --> 14:15.312
DVDs.

14:15.396 --> 14:19.024
Blockbuster's the only game in town.
You're sitting on a goldmine, Timmy.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.067
Lena, you're right.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.527
I was just saying that.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.988
What if we triple the prices of sequels?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.782
These nerds will pay anything
to see if Iron Man dies.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.659
Whoa. Success really changes you.

14:28.742 --> 14:31.245
I told you buying another reindeer
was a good idea.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.454
I'm a reindeer man.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.499
I don't get the joke.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.626
Yay!

14:40.671 --> 14:42.673
You're gonna want the sequel to that.

14:42.756 --> 14:46.886
Not sure you're old enough to rent that.
It's rated F for fantastic.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.554
Oh, Shaq is great in that.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.225
Timmy, you are cleaning up.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.645
I just saw someone rent
a Jimmy Fallon movie. On purpose.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.939
I knew one day
people would abandon streaming

14:59.023 --> 15:02.067
and return to the superior format of DVD.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.447
Sure, it was by force, but I'll take it.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.242
Didn't think people
were still doing public tongue action.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.328
Yep. It's pretty gross.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.123
Oh, Eliza, I need your help
in the break room to--

15:16.206 --> 15:18.959
-Great. Happy to get away from this.
-Oh, good.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.211
I forgot to invent a reason why.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.172
We're only accepting cash.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.300
-Credit cards will be rejected.
-Here you go.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.384
Rejected.

15:27.968 --> 15:34.224
Like how Patrice rejected me.
<i>Le</i> sigh. That's what she always said.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.644
Can you pull yourself together?
We have customers.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.228
I mean, I don't care.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.732
-Patrice.
-You know what, Connie?

15:41.815 --> 15:42.983
If you were so mad at me,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.736
you could've just told me
instead of never calling me back.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.155
And to think I planned
this huge surprise for us.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.617
What? But I was the last one to call you.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.743
Were you?

15:52.826 --> 15:53.744
Was I?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.706
I thought you died, or worse, hated me.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.543
That sounds crazy,
but I value our friendship that much.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.544
Me too.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.968
Wait. What surprise did you plan?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.552
<i>Mon amie...</i>

16:11.470 --> 16:13.722
I'm taking you to Paris...

16:14.640 --> 16:15.975
Hotel in Las Vegas.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.477
Please tell me they have a buffet.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.062
They have <i>deux.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:25.609
I know we have <i>The Jungle Cruise.</i>

16:25.693 --> 16:28.237
There's copies in the back. Give me a sec.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.030
Anything with The Rock in it.

16:30.114 --> 16:34.243
Something for the kids,
and for Mommy when she's in the tub later.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.705
You might want to skip
the Paul Giamatti scenes, tub wise.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.706
Or I might not.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.710
Here we are. Bills, go.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.772
Oh, my God.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.901
Goose... I know I've made mistakes.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.905
But I love you more
than anything on this Earth,

17:11.989 --> 17:13.657
and I want to prove it to you.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.616
So...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.327
Um...

17:17.411 --> 17:20.622
What do you say
we put our past behind us for good?

17:20.706 --> 17:25.669
Will you make me the happiest man
in the world, and remarry me?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.717
No.

17:33.969 --> 17:34.803
I'm sorry?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.808
Should we still do
"I'll Make Love To You"?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.734
What? No,<i> Jungle Cruise?</i>

17:48.817 --> 17:50.444
Oh, no. We're out.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.447
Um, I'll see you later.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.533
Looking forward to our date, boyfriend.

17:57.117 --> 17:57.993
Me too, Eliza.

17:58.702 --> 18:03.624
Um, not Eliza. I meant Lena. Lena.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.543
Yeah, Lena.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.838
I think I'm getting the full picture here.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.841
-Just-- Wait, I--
-Maybe we should cancel tonight.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.718
No, come on. Lena.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.428
This seems like a bad time,

18:16.512 --> 18:20.599
I know, but I'm looking for a movie
about a pig, but not <i>Babe.</i>

18:20.682 --> 18:22.434
It's too big a city.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.645
-I...
-Okay.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.613
Dude, you can't smoke in here.
What are you doing?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.907
Come on. Be cool, man.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.409
Whatever, do what you want. I don't care.

18:39.493 --> 18:44.039
Oh, man, was it a mistake
for me to come here.

18:45.082 --> 18:48.168
I'm a joke.
People just came here to make fun of me.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.588
They're all, "Let's all laugh
at the sad guy with rosacea

18:51.672 --> 18:55.509
who once got escorted
off the<i> Nash Bridges</i> set by cop extras."

18:55.592 --> 18:56.927
I know what you mean.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.138
I mean, not specifically that but...

18:59.680 --> 19:02.766
I just found out
I didn't get into this film program

19:02.850 --> 19:05.060
which had been my lifelong dream.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.062
Didn't even consider I could get rejected.

19:07.146 --> 19:11.150
You want to know something, kid?
Hollywood is filled with rejection.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.111
Even Speven Stielberg
got rejected from USC.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.864
You think I got
<i>But I'm Too Young to be Santa</i>

19:16.947 --> 19:18.240
on the first try?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.827
No. Their first choice
died in a grape juice commercial.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.539
Hollywood crushes dreams. Okay?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.499
Welcome to the club, kid.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.543
You're a Hollywood filmmaker now.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.254
Huh.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.715
-Thanks, man.
-You're welcome.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.508
Okay, good night.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.386
Hannah, can we get some water?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.597
It's really a no?

19:43.515 --> 19:46.059
Can the Jingle Ballers
not be here for this?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.186
Jingle Bills.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.480
You still owe us the other half.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.441
Can we settle this later, Bill?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.573
I gotta be honest,
I did not see this coming.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.992
I thought I've been
doing everything right.

20:02.075 --> 20:02.910
You have been.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.457
But doing a bunch of little things right

20:08.540 --> 20:11.376
doesn't cancel out
the big thing you did wrong.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.462
That's what this is about.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.047
No.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.801
Not entirely, I don't think.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.222
It's not like we didn't have
problems before you cheated,

20:23.305 --> 20:25.891
that was probably why you cheated.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.310
I don't know how to respond to that.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.396
This, us...

20:33.523 --> 20:35.984
it just doesn't feel right anymore.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.862
It was one thing
when we were giving it a go for Ali,

20:38.946 --> 20:41.448
but she's an adult now with her own life.

20:41.531 --> 20:45.827
And we owe it to her
and to ourselves to...

20:46.620 --> 20:48.038
try to be happy.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.458
But what if being with you makes me happy?

20:51.541 --> 20:53.502
I have feelings for someone else.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.254
What?

20:56.129 --> 20:57.214
Since when?

20:57.297 --> 20:58.465
I don't know.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.970
Maybe a few weeks, maybe...

21:04.429 --> 21:05.264
Timmy?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.102
I'm sorry.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.021
I have to go.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.194
-What are you doing?
-Give me that.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.781
Get your hands off my <i>Snow Buddies.</i>
We have a long drive home.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.993
That is the only thing keeping my kids
from chewing through their seat belts.

21:26.076 --> 21:30.289
Hey, there's plenty other movies
that kids love, like... <i>Unfaithful.</i>

21:30.372 --> 21:31.873
Diane Lane is electric in this.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.543
I need <i>Snow Buddies</i> for my kids.
They're "snow" cool.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.169
Hey, we need to talk.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.754
-Now's not the best time.
-I know.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.299
But what you saw back there
made me realize something,

21:40.382 --> 21:42.467
and it's really important
I say it out loud.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.719
Hey, man.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.055
You probably get this a whole lot
but I'm a big fan.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.474
<i>Celebrity Grappling</i>
got me through some tough times.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.892
Would you mind signing this?

21:50.976 --> 21:54.104
And what was it like
to scissor kick Emmanuel Lewis?

21:54.187 --> 21:57.441
Hilarious. That's not a chapter
of my life I'm proud of.

21:57.524 --> 22:01.570
I only did it because I was low on cash
and me and Emmanuel have beef. Excuse me.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.405
-Thank you. Okay.
-Hey. Hey.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.324
-Excuse me, man.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:05.407 --> 22:09.494
-I will give you $100 for this DVD.
-I'll give you the contents of my purse.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.955
Could be nothing of value
or several things of value.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
<i>Storage Wars</i> style.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.000
-Yeah, no thank you.
-Come on.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.169
Don't be like that.
You can't be embarrassed.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.672
You are the man who grappled
the hell out of Tonya Harding.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.174
And she deserved that.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.010
I get it. This is a roast.
You're roasting me.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.387
Timmy. We've known each other so long,

22:27.471 --> 22:30.974
and I want to end the pattern--
I'm tired of having doubts.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.393
-No need for violence.
-Let me have it!

22:33.477 --> 22:35.854
I don't want to talk about
<i>Celebrity Grappling,</i> okay?

22:35.937 --> 22:39.524
If you want to talk about one of my films
in the Lil' Stevie Cinematic Universe,

22:39.608 --> 22:40.692
I would love that.

22:40.776 --> 22:45.197
Hey, I'm not one of those inbred dogs
from earlier, I'm a real fan.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.032
You are making fun of me!

22:49.201 --> 22:51.161
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:51.244 --> 22:52.371
What's happening?

22:58.251 --> 23:00.045
Hey, come on, no. Guys.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.464
Not Buscemi.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.049
Stop, please.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.470
Where's Thimble?

23:08.553 --> 23:09.805
Come on, please stop.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.974
Hey, that's my whole week
you got in your hands, man.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.893
Not cool, bro.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.647
I can't die a virgin.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.232
Who are all these people?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.484
I'm Tad from Ohio. I'm a Scorpio.

23:26.196 --> 23:30.867
To hell with Blockbuster!

23:34.579 --> 23:37.582
So, on the bright side,
you got pretty riled up

23:37.666 --> 23:39.876
when Lil' Stevie sucker punched me,

23:39.960 --> 23:43.672
almost as if you kind of cared
about your old dad.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.258
-Of course I do.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.677
Why did you get so pissed earlier?

23:48.760 --> 23:49.845
Out of nowhere.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.305
When I thought things were good for us.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.642
Because I care about this stupid place
for some reason,

23:55.725 --> 23:58.937
and I was mad
when Stevie was ruining everything and...

23:59.020 --> 24:00.730
I took it out on you

24:00.814 --> 24:03.525
'cause they say you take things out
on those closest to you.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.153
And I guess that's you or whatever.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.362
Or whatever.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.284
You know something?

24:13.493 --> 24:16.705
That right there
was the best part of my year.

24:37.017 --> 24:41.938
It's gonna be okay. We can clean up.
Get everyone to pitch in and we'll keep--

24:42.022 --> 24:43.190
What's the point?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.820
I put everything I had
into this cursed monkey paw of a store

24:48.904 --> 24:51.448
because it's the only place
that's ever felt like home.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.201
The only place
I ever felt like I belonged,

24:54.284 --> 24:56.953
and it's not either
of those things anymore.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.790
There's a reason
over 9,000 Blockbusters have closed.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.752
I was an idiot to think
this would be different.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.422
I'm done.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.216
Done caring about anything.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.218
I'm not buying another reindeer.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.850
I still don't know what that means.

25:23.855 --> 25:24.856
<i>Timmy?</i>

25:25.732 --> 25:26.650
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:28.235
Oh, my God.
