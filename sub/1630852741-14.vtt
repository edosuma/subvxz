ALL THROUGH THE GAME.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.344

00:48.379 --> 00:50.103

ROLL US NOW.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.448
SO THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

00:52.482 --> 00:55.034
YOU HAVE TO CUT THE HEAD OFF
THE SNAKE.

00:55.068 --> 00:57.689
IT IS US OR THEM.

ARTFUL AFFAIR FOR THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

THEY WILL PROBABLY BET RID OF

01:17.379 --> 01:18.793
ME BECAUSE I'M THEIR COMPETITION.

01:18.827 --> 01:21.275
THEY'LL GET RID OF ME.
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISEDDED

01:21.310 --> 01:25.620
IF I GET TARGETED THIS WEEK TO

RIGHT.
TODD IS THE ONLY REMAINING

01:32.034 --> 01:40.517
HUGE THREAT IN THE HOUSE.
TODD HAS GOT TO GO.

VETO SAVE LAMAR OR TODD FROM THE

JULIE CHEN MOONVES, WELCOME TO
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT ON

03:21.448 --> 03:24.655
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
IT DAY 27 INSIDE THE BIG BROTHER

03:24.689 --> 03:28.931
HOUSE AND TODRICK AND MIESHA
HAVE BEEN DOMINATING THIS GAME.

03:28.965 --> 03:34.655
ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE SEIZED
POWER AND HAVE SET THEIR SIGHTS

03:34.689 --> 03:38.310
ON THEIR FORMER ALLY TODD
KNOWING THAT HE IS THEIR BIGGEST

03:38.344 --> 03:41.344
THREAT LEFT IN THE GAME.
BUT TONIGHT IS DOUBLE EVICTION

03:41.379 --> 03:45.586
NIGHT, WHICH MEANS BY THE END OF
THE SHOW, THE TABLES COULD BE

03:45.620 --> 03:51.034
TURNED ON THIS POWERFUL DUO.

03:55.034 --> 03:58.172
SETTLES?
WE'LL ALL FIND OUT LIVE TONIGHT.

03:58.206 --> 04:02.758
BUT FIRST A MERE IN MERE DAYS
TODD HAS GONE FROM THE PENTHOUSE

04:02.793 --> 04:06.689
TO POSSIBLY WALKING OUT OF THE HOUSE.

04:06.724 --> 04:12.758
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS ADJOURNED.

04:12.793 --> 04:17.034
I NOMINATED LAMAR AND TODD.
TODD IS A HUGE THREAT.

04:17.068 --> 04:20.517
I DON'T PERSONALLY FEEL
THREATENED BY CYNTHIA OR LAMAR

04:20.551 --> 04:23.862
UNLESS THERE IS A MODELING OR
BASKETBALL CHAL ECK WHICH I

04:23.896 --> 04:27.000
DON'T FORE SEE HAPPENING.
BUT TODD HAS BEEN PROVEN TO TWIN

04:27.034 --> 04:29.689
THESE RANDOM COMPETITIONS, THERE
IS STILL A CHANCE HE COULD WIN

04:29.724 --> 04:32.275
THIS VETO SO ME AND MIESHA
REALLY HAVE TO STEP IT UP IF WE

04:32.310 --> 04:37.034
WANT TO SEAL THIS DEAL AND PUT
THE FINAL NAIL IN TODD'S BIG

04:37.068 --> 04:39.551
BREER COFFIN.
TOLD YOU.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.655
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE NOMINATED.

04:41.689 --> 04:45.862
IT IS A SMART MOVE ON TODRICK'S
PART, DEFINITELY.

04:45.896 --> 04:48.310
JUST A LITTLE SOFTIE, BUT IF I
WIN THAT VETO YOU WILL SAVE

04:48.344 --> 04:52.448
MYSELF AND COME BACK AND WIN THE
H.O.H. AND PUT HIS AS, ASS UP

04:52.482 --> 04:55.482
THERE AND MAKE HIM SEE HOW IT FEELS.

04:55.517 --> 04:58.655
YOU GUYS ON THE BLOCK WITH
ME, YOU CAN'T WIN VETO.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.034
NO WINNING FOR VETO FOR ME TODAY.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.137
>>S THAT AW TRUE.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO TODD

05:03.172 --> 05:04.862
BECAUSE IT STUBBINGS BEING ON
THE BLOCK.

05:04.896 --> 05:07.620
BUT ALSO I'M JUST RELIEVED THAT
I DON'T SEE MY FACE UP THERE.

05:07.655 --> 05:10.344
THANK YOU JESUS, I PRAYED FOR THAT.

05:10.379 --> 05:14.206
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH TODD

05:14.241 --> 05:17.310
THIS ENTIRE GAME.
BUT WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL

05:17.344 --> 05:19.034
FIVE.
AND OF THE PEOPLE LEFT IN THE

05:19.068 --> 05:21.517
HOUSE, I THINK TODD IS THE
BIGGEST THREAT.

05:21.551 --> 05:24.068
SO SORRY TODD, BUT IT'S YOUR
TIME TO GO UP.

05:24.103 --> 05:29.241
GIVE ME A HUG AND A KISS.
DID YOU ENJOY THE

05:29.275 --> 05:30.655
PERFORMANCE?
I DID.

05:30.689 --> 05:35.689
THANK YOU.
ME AND TODD HAVE BNG CLOSE, I

05:35.724 --> 05:38.448
WOULD LIKE IT TO SEE TODD GO AS
FAR AS POSSIBLE.

05:38.482 --> 05:41.000
AIN'T NO QUITTING IN NIE BLOOD.
I WILL JUST GO OUT THERE AND DO

05:41.034 --> 05:43.689
MY BEST AND LET THE CHIPS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.689
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT TO HAVE
FUN WITH MY NOMINATION CEREMONY.

05:46.724 --> 05:58.379
THE TRAIN TOOK ME OUT AND
THEN THE KEY IS THE CROWN.

05:58.413 --> 06:01.896
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.
OH MY GOD.

06:01.931 --> 06:03.206
I WAS COMPLETELY CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

06:03.241 --> 06:06.034
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS TO BE.

06:06.068 --> 06:09.724
THEY DEFINITELY THOUGHT IT
WAS FUNNY BUT I THINK TODD'S.

06:09.758 --> 06:12.413
YOU THINK SO?
TODD IS TAKING THIS A LITTLE

06:12.448 --> 06:15.689
PERSONALLY, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT
DO I OWE TODD BRIDGES AT THIS

06:15.724 --> 06:18.241
POINT, AND SECONDLY AFTER THAT
PERFORMANCE, YOU'RE GOING TO

06:18.275 --> 06:21.758
WALK AWAY WITH THAT KIND OF FACE.

06:21.793 --> 06:29.758
THE AUDACITY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT.

06:29.793 --> 06:32.862
THIS GAME IS CRAZY.
I KNOW, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

06:32.896 --> 06:35.034
EARLIER TODAY.
I WAS LIKE INSANE THAT WE'RE

06:35.068 --> 06:38.689
STILL HERE AND THAT WE ONLY HAVE
ONE MAJOR TARGET TO TAKE OUT.

06:38.724 --> 06:40.655
YEAH.
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THE END

06:40.689 --> 06:44.137
OF THE ROAD IS LIKE, I MEAN,
UNLESS THERE IS SOME HUGE TWIST

06:44.172 --> 06:48.103
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF, IT IT FEELS
LIKE THE END OF THE OAD IS LIKE

06:48.137 --> 06:54.655
IN SIGHT SHOW. YEAH.

06:54.689 --> 07:00.275
WE SHOULD HAVE-- THAT PAIR
AWHILE AGO.

07:00.310 --> 07:03.137
THEY GET STRONGER AND
STRONGER AS IT IT WENT ON.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.241
NOW IT'S LIKE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO BREAK THEM UP.

07:06.275 --> 07:12.448
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM EVEN MORE
MAD AT,.

07:12.482 --> 07:15.689
THE HEADS UP.
IT DIDN'T DO THAT.

07:15.724 --> 07:19.931
I FEEL THAT I GAVE ALL MY
TRUST TO MEESH AND TODRICK WHEN

07:19.965 --> 07:21.551
WE WERE GOING IT TO BE THE FINAL FOUR.

07:21.586 --> 07:24.896
BUT ONE OF THEM DID ME DIRTY.
PUT ME UP TO GO HOME.

07:24.931 --> 07:26.689
WOW.
> I KNOW THAT'S PLAYING THE

07:26.724 --> 07:29.931
GAME.
BUT COLD, COLD, COLD.

07:29.965 --> 07:33.206
THEY TRICKED ME TO GET RID OF
CARSON, THAT IS WHAT THEY BOTH

07:33.241 --> 07:34.931
DID.
AND THAT KIND OF MAKES ME MAD.

07:34.965 --> 07:37.172
THEY TRICKED ME TO GET RID OF CARSON.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.034
I AIN'T GOING TO SAY I TOLD
YOU SO.

07:40.068 --> 07:44.517
I KNOW.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I'M

07:44.551 --> 07:45.827
MORE.
BECAUSE YOU PLAYED WITH THEM

07:45.862 --> 07:49.896
THE ENTIRE TIME.
AND I PLAYED WITH INTEGRITY

07:49.931 --> 07:52.862
AND NOT.
MIESHA AND TODRICK BETTER

07:52.896 --> 07:57.344
HOPE I DON'T WIN THAT VETO COMP
BECAUSE IF I DO IT'S GOING TO BE

07:57.379 --> 08:00.310
TROUBLE BREWING IN THE
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER" HOUSE

08:00.344 --> 08:06.724
BECAUSE TODD IS GOING TO BE ON
THE WAR PATH.

08:06.758 --> 08:10.137
YOU WERE LOYAL TO THEM I WAS LOYAL.

08:10.172 --> 08:16.482
AND I RESPECTED MYSELF.
I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP

08:16.517 --> 08:18.724
BUT.
YOU DIDN'T TAKE A NAP?

08:18.758 --> 08:26.689
I WAS GOING TO BUT THIS GAME
HAS SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS.

08:26.724 --> 08:29.862
OH MY GOD.
I LOVE IT IT THOUGH.

08:29.896 --> 08:38.689
ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
REALLY CRAZY TWISTS AND TURNS.

08:38.724 --> 08:42.103
I'M LIKE DAMN, YOU TRYING TO

08:42.137 --> 08:44.241
SCARE ME AND BREAK ME BEFORE THE
FINAL COMPETITION?

08:44.275 --> 08:48.379
I KNOW YOU'RE COMPETITIVE AND
ALL BUT DON'T TAKE ME OUT, I'M

08:48.413 --> 08:51.103
ON YOUR TEAM.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

08:51.137 --> 08:55.034
I JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE
SHE-- ON ME LIKE THAT.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.620
THAT WAS A LITTLE SCARY.
USED TO MEN COMING UP BEHIND ME

08:57.655 --> 09:02.586
BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT AND I'M
OKAY WITH IT.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.689
OH MY GOD.
I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY MIND.

09:03.724 --> 09:22.586
I WOULD HAVE LIKED DROPPED ON
THE GROUND.

09:22.620 --> 09:27.068
MIESHA LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOING
TO KICK SOMEBODY'S ASS, THE

09:27.103 --> 09:30.000
AMBIENCE OF A FIGHT, THE
ATMOSPHERE, NOTHING LIKE IT, I

09:30.034 --> 09:33.379
PLAYED IN GAMES, THE NBA
CHAMPIONSHIPS, THE PROFESSIONAL

09:33.413 --> 09:36.241
FIGHTS, I HAVE A APPRECIATE FOR
ANYBODY WHO GETS IN THAT RANGE,

09:36.275 --> 09:38.862
SQUARE OFF, 100 PERCENT.
MIESHA, WAS YOUR-- FIGHTING

09:38.896 --> 09:40.689
TOO?
UH-HUH.

09:40.724 --> 09:43.310
IS HE ANY GOOD?
HE IS.

09:43.344 --> 09:46.689
MIGHT EVEN BE GREAT DEPENDING
ON WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME.

09:46.724 --> 09:49.965
- SAY WHAT?
- T I SAID HE MIGHT EVEN BE GREAT

09:50.000 --> 09:52.517
DEPENDING WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.689
KIDDINGK LAMAR.
I KNOW.

09:54.724 --> 09:58.689
KIND OF.
DOES HE HAVE A CALLI FLOWER

09:58.724 --> 10:00.517
EAR?
-- CAULIFLOWER EAR.

10:00.551 --> 10:01.827
YEAH.
MOST FIGHTERS DO.

10:01.862 --> 10:05.965
YOU SEE SOMEBODY IN THE BAR WITH
A CAULIFLOWER EAR, YOU BETTER

10:06.000 --> 10:08.482
NOT MESS WITH THEM.
YOU DON'T SEE WOMEN WITH

10:08.517 --> 10:11.379
CAULI FLRKS OW ER.
WHY IS THAT.

10:11.413 --> 10:14.000
GENERALLY WE ARE MORE
FLEXIBLE, HOW YOU GET IT IS

10:14.034 --> 10:16.172
FOLDING YOUR EAR AND BREAKING
THE CART LADGE.

10:16.206 --> 10:19.034
IT SEEMS WOMEN HAVE MORE
FLEXIBLE EARS.

10:19.068 --> 10:24.034
IT ST BECAUSE THE BLOOD IS
RUSHING IT TO THE EAR, WHEN YOU

10:24.068 --> 10:27.724
BREAK YOUR NOSE IT DOMES OUT,
BUT IN YOUR EAR IT JUST, IT

10:27.758 --> 10:31.620
CAN'T DO THAT.
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN NBA PLAY

10:31.655 --> 10:36.310
WE ARE A CAULIFLOWER EARNESS
WHEN YOU GET INTO IT TW SOMEBODY

10:36.344 --> 10:40.034
WITH A CAULIFLOWER HERE, MY
ADVICE IS WALK AWAY.

10:40.068 --> 10:51.620
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE, FOR
REAL, FOR REAL.

10:51.655 --> 10:56.379
IF YOU WIN, SAVE YOURSELF.
IF YOU WIN THE VETO, SAVE

10:56.413 --> 10:57.310
YOURSELF.
I COULD TAKE YOU OFF THE

10:57.344 --> 11:00.000
BLOCK, BUT I WILL STILL BE ON
THE BLOCK.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.413
THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING, SO
JUST SAVE YOURSELF.

11:01.448 --> 11:06.689
DON'T WORRY WITH ABOUT ME.
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE SAME

11:06.724 --> 11:08.448
THING.
BUT LET'S PLAY IT FIRST, LET'S

11:08.482 --> 11:09.896
SEE WHAT IT IS. YEAH.

11:09.931 --> 11:13.206
BEING ON THE BLOCK WITH LAMAR
SUCKS BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE

11:13.241 --> 11:15.827
BROTHERS.
YOU KNOW, BUT IF I WIN THAT

11:15.862 --> 11:20.689
VETO, THE TERRIBLE THING IS THAT
I WILL BE SAYING AMAR COULD

11:20.724 --> 11:27.241
ABOUT HOME.
>>, H-O-H.

11:27.275 --> 11:33.344
♪.
JUST KIDDING, THAT MOMENT IS

11:33.379 --> 11:36.482
OVER.
SEE THAT A SIGN THAT SOMEBODY IS

11:36.517 --> 11:40.413
NOT A GRACIOUS WINNER.
I KNOW.

11:40.448 --> 11:42.448
YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

11:42.482 --> 11:44.862
I ALWAYS BEEN TOLD TO BE
GRACIOUS, WIN OR LOSE.

11:44.896 --> 11:49.241
IT IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT
TODRICK HAS NOT LEARNED THAT

11:49.275 --> 11:50.448
MESSON-- LESSON.
ME AND MY BOY TODD WILL SHOW HIM

11:50.482 --> 11:57.310
HOW IT IS DONE WHEN ONE OF US
WIN THIS VETO.

11:57.344 --> 12:05.448
DON'T-- .
IT'S THE HOMESTRETCH.

12:05.482 --> 12:13.379
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME
KIND OF WORRIED, IF HE WINS THE

12:13.413 --> 12:17.379
VETO.
UH-HUH.

12:17.413 --> 12:23.137
HOW COULD TAKE BLAMAR OFF,
BU LAMAR WAS NEVER A THREAT TO

12:23.172 --> 12:25.379
ME ANYWAY.
HE IS AN ATHLETE BUT I EXPECTED

12:25.413 --> 12:31.758
HIM IT TO PERFORM DIFFERENTLY IN
THE COMPETITIONS THAN HE HAS.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.344
YEAH.
BUT IT TWORKED OUT BECAUSE IT

12:33.379 --> 12:36.862
KEPT THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE.
FOR SURE.

12:36.896 --> 12:39.310
LAMAR DEFINITELY NEEDS TO GO
AT SOME POINT.

12:39.344 --> 12:45.241
HE AND TODD ARE A DUO.
BUT TODD IS 100% MY TARGET.

12:45.275 --> 12:49.344
SO EITHER MIESHA OR I REALLY
NEED TO WIN THIS VETO.

12:49.379 --> 12:53.724
SO WE CAN KEEP NOMS THE SAME AND
SEND TODD PACKING.

12:53.758 --> 12:57.310
IF HERE WAS EVER A WEEK FOR
THIS TO HAPPEN, THIS IS THE

12:57.344 --> 13:03.758
WEEK.
YEAH, FOR SURE.

13:03.793 --> 13:08.275
UP NEXT, THE POWER OF VETO IS
BACK UP FOR GRABS AND IT IS DO

13:08.310 --> 13:13.379
OR DIE FOR TODD, IF HE HOPES TO
KEEP HIS GAME ALIVE.

13:13.413 --> 13:16.448
AND LATER WE'LL SURPRISE THE
HOUSEGUESTS AND LET THEM THOUGH

13:16.482 --> 13:19.034
THAT TONIGHT IS DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT.

13:19.068 --> 13:20.413
STAY WITH US.

13:36.758 --> 13:39.482
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER," IT IT

13:39.517 --> 13:42.655
IS NOW TIME FOR THE POWER OF
VETO COMPETITION.

13:42.689 --> 13:50.068
AND AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME IT
IS A MITION-WIN-- MUST-WIN FOR

13:50.103 --> 13:51.517
EVERYONE.
HEY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR

13:51.551 --> 13:54.241
THE VETO COMPETITION.
BLETS' GET DRESSED AND HEAD TO

13:54.275 --> 13:58.241
THE BACKYARD.
OH MY GOD.

13:58.275 --> 14:09.137
YOU LOOK GOOD.
OH MY GOODNESS.

14:09.172 --> 14:10.448
OH.
WHAT?

14:10.482 --> 14:15.448
I WALK OUT AND I SEE SNOW AND
I SEE SOME KIND OF SPEEDWAY AND

14:15.482 --> 14:18.689
I'M WONDERING WHAT ARE WE DOING
WITH THESE WHEELS RIGHT HERE.

14:18.724 --> 14:23.827
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON
BUT I'M HERE FOR IT.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.241
I CURSE YOU FOR PUTTING ME IN
THIS OUTFIT.

14:26.275 --> 14:29.172
WE NEED TO TALK BECAUSE THIS
JUST DOESN'T WORK.

14:29.206 --> 14:34.275
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
I LOOK LIKE A TELETUBIE.

14:34.310 --> 14:38.275
YOU GOT BOOTY DOO.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT BOOTY

14:38.310 --> 14:44.103
DOO WHERE YOUR STOMACH HANGS OUT
FURTHER THAN YOUR BOOTY.

14:44.137 --> 14:47.241
I'M H.O.H. THIS WEEK AND I
DON'T WANT TODD TO WIN BECAUSE

14:47.275 --> 14:49.965
HE'S MY TARGET.
ULTIMATELY I WANT MIESHA OR I TO

14:50.000 --> 14:52.965
WIN, IF ESHA OR I WIN THIS VETO,
IT IT FEELS LIKE A VERY CLEAR

14:53.000 --> 14:57.724
PATH TO THE END.
IF I WIN THE VETO

14:57.758 --> 14:59.827
COMPETITION, IT IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER WHO I TAKE DOWN,

14:59.862 --> 15:04.379
TODD OR LAMAR, WHAT REALLY
MATTERS IS THAT MIESHA WILL BE

15:04.413 --> 15:08.758
GOING UP, AND THEN THAT WILL
CHANGE EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE.

15:08.793 --> 15:13.448
WHEN I WAS ON TEAM U.S.A.,
TODAY I'M GOING FOR GOLD.

15:13.482 --> 15:17.931
AND GOLD MEANS THE POWER OF VETO.

15:17.965 --> 15:21.137
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT
TODRICK OR I WIN THIS

15:21.172 --> 15:23.379
COMPETITION.
WE NEED THE NOMINATIONS TO STAY

15:23.413 --> 15:24.965
THE SAME.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYONE ELSE

15:25.000 --> 15:29.034
IS THINKING IN THIS GAME BUT IF
ANYBODY PULLS TODD OFF THE

15:29.068 --> 15:34.275
BLOCK, THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER.
MIESHA AND TODRICK ARE GOING

15:34.310 --> 15:37.758
TO-- I'M THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
LEFT IN THE HOUSE WHO HAS WON A

15:37.793 --> 15:39.241
COMP.
SO THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO

15:39.275 --> 15:46.448
STAY IS TO WIN THAT VETO.
WELCOME TO AMERICA'S FAVORITE

15:46.482 --> 15:53.068
NEW GAME SHOW, CELEBRITY LUGE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

15:53.103 --> 15:58.000
A RANDOM DRAW WILL DETERMINE WHO
WILL COMPETE IN THE FIRST

15:58.034 --> 16:00.689
HEAD-TO-HEAD CELEBRITY MATCH.
YOUR GOAL IN EACH MATCH IS TO

16:00.724 --> 16:03.620
COMPLETE YOUR RUN AS CLOSE AS
POSSIBLE TO THE TARGET TIME

16:03.655 --> 16:06.310
GIVEN TO YOU.
THE PLAYER CLOSEST TO THAT TIME

16:06.344 --> 16:10.172
WINS THE ROUND.
AND CONTINUES ON IN THE GAME.

16:10.206 --> 16:14.310
THEY THEN MUST PICK THE NEXT TWO
PLAYERS TO FACE OFF IN ANOTHER

16:14.344 --> 16:18.034
HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCH.
THE LOSING LUGER IN EACH ROUND

16:18.068 --> 16:21.517
WILL BE ELIMINATED.
THE LAST PLAYER STANDING WILL

16:21.551 --> 16:32.344
WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.
WHO IS READY TO PLAY CELEBRITY

16:32.379 --> 16:34.068
LUGE.
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO IS

16:34.103 --> 16:42.275
GOING TO BE FACING OFF FIRST.
THE FIRST PLAYER WILL BE

16:42.310 --> 16:44.482
MIESHA.
PLEASE DON'T LET ME PLAY

16:44.517 --> 16:48.655
AGAINST HER.
AND THE SECOND PLAYER WILL

16:48.689 --> 16:52.275
BE.
CYNTHIA.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.655
BY REASON DOM DRAW I GET
PICKED TO GO AGAINST MIESHA.

16:54.689 --> 16:58.034
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
MIESHA?

16:58.068 --> 17:00.586
I'M GOING AGAINST MIESHA?
REALLY?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.310
OH LORD.
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY.

17:02.344 --> 17:05.344
LET'S GO, CYNTHIA.
YOU GOT THIS.

17:05.379 --> 17:08.413
ALL RIGHT LADIES, Y'ALL
READY?

17:08.448 --> 17:12.241
I'M FEELING CONFIDENT ABOUT
BEING UP FIRST.

17:12.275 --> 17:15.344
AY TIME I FIGHT IN THE OCTAGONE
I HAVE GOT TO SET A STONE IN THE

17:15.379 --> 17:17.862
FIRST ROUND.
FIGHTING IS ALL ABOUT SETTING A

17:17.896 --> 17:19.413
PACE.
I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT SO

17:19.448 --> 17:24.137
I'M GOING TO KNOCK OUT THESE
OTHER HOUSEGUESTS ONE AT A TIME.

17:24.172 --> 17:26.793
PLAYERS, YOUR TARGET TIME IS
10 SECONDS.

17:26.827 --> 17:30.034
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION, WE HAVE TO GET ON

17:30.068 --> 17:34.620
OUR BOBSLED, PUSH OFF, AND THE
PLAYER CLOSEST TO THE TARGET

17:34.655 --> 17:37.689
TIME EITHER UNDER OR OVER IS THE
WINNER OF THAT ROUND.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.724
THE WINNER OF EACH ROUND THEN
CHOOSES THE THEKS TWO

17:40.758 --> 17:46.275
HOUSEGUESTS TO COMPETE.
WHOEVER WINS THE FINAL ROUND

17:46.310 --> 17:55.586
WINS THE POWER OF VETO.
MY STRATEGY IS TO IS LAY

17:55.620 --> 17:59.310
DOWN, THE THE DUMBIES ARE LAYING
DOWN SO I WANT TO SHOW KIND OF

17:59.344 --> 18:05.965
LAY DOWN BUT KEEP MY HEAD UP.
BUT I'M REALIZING AS I'M GOING

18:06.000 --> 18:08.482
DOWN THAT MAYBE WAS NOT THE BEST STRATEGY.

18:08.517 --> 18:12.724
I THINK HAD I BEEN SITTING UP I
WOULD HAVE HAD BETTER CONTROL OF

18:12.758 --> 18:23.241
MY SPEED.
SORRY, CYNTHIA.

18:23.275 --> 18:27.827
YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.
THE TARGET TIME WAS 10

18:27.862 --> 18:31.241
SECONDS.
I CAME IN AT 2.51 SECONDS AWAY

18:31.275 --> 18:33.620
FROM THE TARGET TIME.
AND THAT WAS UNFORTUNATELY NOT

18:33.655 --> 18:38.758
ENOUGH TO BEAT MIESHA.
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I WAS

18:38.793 --> 18:42.103
ELIMINATED IN ROUND ONE.
THIS WAS MY BIG CHANCE TO DO

18:42.137 --> 18:45.482
TWHA I CAN TO GET MIESHA UP ON
THE BLOCK.

18:45.517 --> 18:51.413
NOW MY SAFETY IN THIS HOUSE IS
GONE, ALL DOWN HILL JUST LIKE MY

18:51.448 --> 18:54.275
BOBSLED.
CONGRATULATIONS, MIESHA, YOU

18:54.310 --> 18:58.275
HAVE WON THE ROUND.
NOW WHO DO YOU WANT TO COMPETE

18:58.310 --> 19:01.793
IN THE NEXT CELEBRITY LUGE
MATCH?

19:01.827 --> 19:05.206
I PICK TODRICK AND TODD.
I PICKED TODRICK AND TODD

19:05.241 --> 19:11.034
BECAUSE TODD IS OUR TARGET.
DADDY'S COMING FOR YOU.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.310
SO THE SOONER WE CAN GET TODD
OUT OF THIS COMPETITION, THE

19:14.344 --> 19:16.620
BETTER.
MIESHA SELECT ME TO GO

19:16.655 --> 19:18.724
AGAINST TODRICK.
I'M A LOT BETTER AT THIS GAME

19:18.758 --> 19:22.310
THAN PEOPLE REALIZE AND NOW IT'S
TIME TO SHOW THEM WHAT I REALLY

19:22.344 --> 19:27.896
CAN DO.
WITH THIS TELETUBIE BODY.

19:27.931 --> 19:31.965
PLAYERS, YOUR TARGET TIME IS
14 SECONDS.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.137
OKAY.
SO YOU HAVE TO PUSH RIGHT AWAY.

19:34.172 --> 19:37.827
I HAVE LUGED BEFORE, SO MY
STRATEGY IS GOING TO BE WAIT TO

19:37.862 --> 19:40.379
PUSH OFF AT THE RIGHT MOMENT SO
THAT MY TIMING IS CORRECT.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.034
IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING IN THIS GAME.

19:42.068 --> 19:51.965
I KNOW IT HAS TO BE.
THE HORN SOUNDS AND MY

19:52.000 --> 19:55.275
STRATEGY IS TO TWAIT FOR TODD TO
GO AND I THINK HE'S WAITING FOR

19:55.310 --> 19:57.551
ME TO GO.
AT A CERTAIN POINT I JUST HAVE

19:57.586 --> 20:00.034
TO PUSH OFF BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THE TIME IS GOING TO BE UP SO WE

20:00.068 --> 20:05.103
BOTH GOING TO BE SITTING OVER
HERE LOOKING LIKE WE ARE IN A

20:05.137 --> 20:09.275
UNITARD.
AND I WOULD NOT GO TO BRUSH WITH

20:09.310 --> 20:14.275
TODD WEARING THAT.
NO MA'AM.

20:14.310 --> 20:17.137
THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS
COMPETITION IS THAT ONCE YOU

20:17.172 --> 20:19.137
PUSH OFF YOU HAVE NO MORE CONTROL.

20:19.172 --> 20:21.551
THERE IS A LOT OF WEIGHT ON TOP
OF THIS LUGE AND NOT ONLY AM I

20:21.586 --> 20:25.137
TRYING TO HIT THE TARGET TIME
BUT I GOT TO CARRY THIS DEAD

20:25.172 --> 20:26.310
WEIGHT?
COME ON, DUDE.

20:26.344 --> 20:37.413
HELP ME OUT!
BOOM, I BEAT YOU, TODRICK.

20:37.448 --> 20:40.344
I PLAY A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES SO
ST LIKE A VIDEO GAME TO ME.

20:40.379 --> 20:43.172
IT IS IS ALL TIMING AND I KNEW
THAT IF I WAITED AND WAITED AND

20:43.206 --> 20:45.586
PUSH OFF AT THE RIGHT MOMENT,
THAT I CAN GET DOWN THERE AND

20:45.620 --> 20:49.758
WIN IT.
MIESHA, I'M COMING FOR YOU NEXT.

20:49.793 --> 20:52.310
TORY, TODRICK, YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATEDDED.

20:52.344 --> 21:00.689
>>GOOD JOB, TODD.
I CANNOT BELIEVE I LOST TO

21:00.724 --> 21:03.034
TODD.
SUCH A LUGER.

21:03.068 --> 21:05.965
CONGRATULATIONS, TODD.
YOU HAVE WON THE ROUND.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.241
NOW WHO DO YOU WANT TO COMPETE
IN THE NEXT CELEBRITY LUGE

21:10.275 --> 21:12.206
MATCH.
SINCE THERE ARE ONLY TWO

21:12.241 --> 21:15.482
PLAYERS LEFT, MIESHA AND LAMAR,
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

21:15.517 --> 21:18.655
OH, TODD BEATS TODRICK, THIS
WAS NOT A PART OF THE PLAN.

21:18.689 --> 21:21.413
I GUESS IT'S UP TO ME TO TAKE
TODD OUT.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.586
BUT FIRST I'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH LAMAR.

21:24.620 --> 21:27.241
PLAYERS, YOUR TARGET TIME IS
8 SECONDS.

21:27.275 --> 21:30.655
I GOT TO WIN THIS EVENT.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THE

21:30.689 --> 21:36.551
WINNER CIRCLE, JUST ONE TIME.
I'M ON THE BLOCK AS WELL SO I

21:36.586 --> 21:42.310
WOULD RATHER HAVE MY FATE IN MY
OWN HANDS.

21:42.344 --> 21:46.103
MY STRATEGY DEPENDS ON WHAT TIME
I NEED, THINKING IF YOU LEAN

21:46.137 --> 21:48.620
FORWARD ON IT.
YOU PROBABLY GO A LITTLE FASTER

21:48.655 --> 21:52.034
AND IF YOU LEAN BACK YOU
PROBABLY SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE

21:52.068 --> 21:53.793
BIT.
OH NO.

21:53.827 --> 22:01.862
COME ONK LAMAR, COME ON, LAMAR.

22:01.896 --> 22:05.689
OH, SORRY, LAMAR.
YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.034
HEY TODD, IT IS DOWN TO ME
AND YOU, LET'S GO.

22:09.068 --> 22:11.448
TOO BAD THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO
TAKE OUT MIESHA.

22:11.482 --> 22:13.448
I HOPE TODD REALLY CAN GET THIS WIN.

22:13.482 --> 22:16.827
JUST FOR THE FACT THAT HE CAN
TAKE AT LEAST HIS SELF OFF.

22:16.862 --> 22:20.034
YES, MIESHA WON.
NOW IT'S DOWN TO HER AND TODD.

22:20.068 --> 22:23.344
I'M COUNTING ON MIESHA TO WIN
THIS COMPETITION.

22:23.379 --> 22:25.793
BABY, I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY SLED.

22:25.827 --> 22:28.689
AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO.
I BEAT LAMAR BUT THERE IS NO

22:28.724 --> 22:31.965
TIME TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE I HAVE
GOT TO BEAT TODD THIS FINAL

22:32.000 --> 22:33.931
ROUND.
SO I CAN WIN THE POWER OF VETO

22:33.965 --> 22:39.034
AND KEEP THE NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

22:39.068 --> 22:42.620
THE THE STAKES HAVE CHANGED
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT I AM

22:42.655 --> 22:45.448
THINKING UP HERE.
THEY TOOK OUT CYNTHIA, AND LAMAR

22:45.482 --> 22:48.620
BUT NOW IT IS TIME FOR TODD TO
TAKE OUT MIESHA.

22:48.655 --> 22:52.137
LAST TIME I REALIZED I NEED TO
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.

22:52.172 --> 22:55.827
I'M HOPING CAN I WAIT FOR HER TO
PUSH OFF, PUSH OFF RIGHT

22:55.862 --> 22:58.241
BEHINDER, LEAN FORWARD A LITTLE
BIT TO GET THE WIN.

22:58.275 --> 23:02.034
THERE IS NO PREPARATION COULD
EVER PREPARE YOU FOR THIS.

23:02.068 --> 23:05.482
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO ROOT FOR
TODD, IT'S PROBABLY SMARTER FOR

23:05.517 --> 23:10.275
ME TO ROOT FOR MIESHA BECAUSE IF
SHE WINS, SHE WILL PROBABLY KEEP

23:10.310 --> 23:16.448
THE NOMINATIONS THE SAME, WHICH
WILL KEEP ME OFF THE BLOCK.

23:16.482 --> 23:26.586
PLAYERS, YOUR TARGET TIME IS
12 SECONDS.

23:26.620 --> 23:30.275
TODD CAN'T WIN.
IF HE DOES, HE IS GOING TO PULL

23:30.310 --> 23:33.310
HIMSELF OFF THE BLOCK AND THAT
MEANS I HAVE TO PUT UP A

23:33.344 --> 23:44.275
REPLACEMENT NOM, THERE GOES OUR TARGET.

23:44.310 --> 23:49.689
CONGRATULATIONS, TODD, YOU
HAVE WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF

23:49.724 --> 23:51.586
VETO!
OH MY-- OKAY, WELL, I DON'T

23:51.620 --> 23:53.862
THINK IT IS GOING TO FIT BUT CONGRATULATIONS.

23:53.896 --> 23:55.896
COACH TOLD ME YOU GOT TO GO, BRIDGES.

23:55.931 --> 23:58.793
I SAID I'M YOUR MAN, COACH, I'M
YOUR MAN, GET IN THERE.

23:58.827 --> 24:01.551
AND GUESS WHAT I DID. VICTORY.

24:01.586 --> 24:05.758
I'M USING THE POWER OF VETO
ON MYSELF!

24:05.793 --> 24:10.655
SINGING LIKE HIS ASS BROKE.
TODRICK, I'M COMING FOR YOU.

24:10.689 --> 24:15.482
TROUBLE IS COMING TO STEL EBB
RIT "BIG BROTHER."

24:15.517 --> 24:17.931
LESS THAN ONE SECOND DIFFERENCE.

24:17.965 --> 24:22.344
THIS LOSS REALLY STINGS BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT, TODD, YOU BEAT ME

24:22.379 --> 24:24.034
FAIR AND SQUARE, CONGRATULATIONS.

24:24.068 --> 24:26.137
I GUESS TODD RECOGNIZE AND HAVE
I TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING

24:26.172 --> 24:29.517
BOARD THIS WEEK.
I'M GLAD TODD WON THE VETO.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.034
I WISH I WOULD HAVE WON THE VETO.

24:32.068 --> 24:36.896
IF NOTHING ELSE, TODD HAS FORCED
TODRICK AND MIESHA TO THANKING

24:36.931 --> 24:40.379
THEIR PLANS.
THIS MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR

24:40.413 --> 24:44.758
LAMAR ODOM BUT IT IS PRETTY GOOD
FOR TODD BRIDGES.

24:44.793 --> 24:47.034
YAYY, TODD WINS, NEVER IN A
MILLION YEARS DID I THINK THAT

24:47.068 --> 24:50.206
TODD BRIDGES WOULD BECOME A
COMPETITION BEAST AT THE FINAL

24:50.241 --> 24:51.620
INNING.
I JUST MADE A SPORTS REFERENCE.

24:51.655 --> 24:55.517
THAT IS HOW CRAZY THIS IS TO ME.
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE GAME

24:55.551 --> 25:03.517
FOR MIESHA AND I.
Julie: SO TODD HAS WON THE

25:03.551 --> 25:06.310
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.
AND WILL MOST LIKELY AVOID BEING

25:06.344 --> 25:08.068
THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

25:08.103 --> 25:13.551
BUT WHAT NOBODY KNOWS IS IT IS
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT WHICH

25:13.586 --> 25:17.000
MEANS NO ONE IS SAFE.
STAY WITH US.

25:33.206 --> 25:36.034
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

25:36.068 --> 25:40.310
FEELING BETRAYED AND DOUBLE
CROSSED BY HIS FORMER ALLIES,

25:40.344 --> 25:49.551
TODD LOOKS FOR REVENG.
ALL RIGHT.

25:49.586 --> 25:51.068
WHO.
WELL, THAT IS FUN.

25:51.103 --> 25:54.862
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
I GOT IN THE GAME AM I GOT IN

25:54.896 --> 25:57.034
THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND AND I WON.

25:57.068 --> 26:01.344
IT'S BEEN A SHAKEUP IN THE
BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

26:01.379 --> 26:08.068
THIS IS WAR, TODRICK, WAR.
IF I STILL HAVE ANY FANS AT

26:08.103 --> 26:10.896
THIS POINT, THEY HAVE ABANDONED
ME AT THIS POINT.

26:10.931 --> 26:15.241
THEY'RE LIKE GIRL.
YOU CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING.

26:15.275 --> 26:18.620
TODD IS GOING TO PULL HIMSELF
DOWN, THAT MEANS THAT I WILL BE

26:18.655 --> 26:20.586
GOING UP.
I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS HOUSE

26:20.620 --> 26:24.862
REALIZES THAT LAMAR IS ACTUALLY
A BIGGER THREAT THAN I AM.

26:24.896 --> 26:29.137
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE HE HASN'T
WON ANY GAMES QUET DOES NOT

26:29.172 --> 26:36.241
ERASE THE FACT THAT HE IS AN NBA
CHAMPION!

26:36.275 --> 26:41.103
I DIDN'T WIN THE VETO.
THAT WASN'T MY PLAN.

26:41.137 --> 26:44.448
ATLY MY BIG BROTHER TODD WON IT
AND I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB AT

26:44.482 --> 26:47.724
SPOILING MIESHA AND TODD RIK'S
PLANS.

26:47.758 --> 26:52.206
AND I'M HAPPY THAT MIESHA AND
TODRICK AIN'T GETTING THEIR WAY.

26:52.241 --> 26:57.068
SAY ONE THING HE WAS GOING
WIN THAT AND DANCE OFF TO THE

26:57.103 --> 26:59.344
SUNSET.
SO FRUSTRATING.

26:59.379 --> 27:01.344
THE WORST OF THE WORST HAS HAPPENED.

27:01.379 --> 27:06.275
TODD BRIDGES JUST WON THE VETO!
OH MY GOODNESS.

27:06.310 --> 27:10.241
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR MY GAME.
AND MIESHA AND I GOT TO GO BACK

27:10.275 --> 27:13.172
TO THE DRAWING BOARD BECAUSE
THIS JUST WENT FROM A SMALL CAT

27:13.206 --> 27:28.103
FIGHT INTO A FULL BLOWN BATTLE.

28:20.206 --> 28:23.034
WHERE DO YOU SEE THE NEXT
FIVE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE LOOKING

28:23.068 --> 28:24.896
LIKE?
I THINK I WANT TO KEEP DOING

28:24.931 --> 28:28.034
MUSIC AND STUFF BUT I THINK MY
REAL GIFT IS WRITING.

28:28.068 --> 28:31.379
LIKE I WOULD LOVE, LOVE, LOVE TO
WRITE BROADWAY SHOWS AND CREATE

28:31.413 --> 28:35.758
MY OWN VERSION OF STUFF WHERE I
RETELL FAIRY TALES THAT HAVE

28:35.793 --> 28:39.206
ALREADY BEEN TOLD BUT WITH MORE
ETHNIC CHARACTERSES.

28:39.241 --> 28:42.000
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PITCH THIS
FOR AWHILE AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE

28:42.034 --> 28:46.034
THERE ARE SO MANY VERSIONS OF
CINDERELLA AND WONDERLAND, BUT

28:46.068 --> 28:48.448
MOST HAVE WHITE BLOND PEOPLE IN
ALL OF THOSE ROLES AND I THINK

28:48.482 --> 28:53.034
THAT WE'RE IN A NEW AGE AND WE
SHOULD REINTRODUCE THESE STORIES

28:53.068 --> 28:56.275
WITH KIDS WITH A DIVERSE
AUDIENCE, IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED

28:56.310 --> 29:00.517
TO BE A BLACK PERSON, IT JUST
NEEDS TO LOOK MORE INCLUSIVE.

29:00.551 --> 29:04.241
I JUST HAVE GROWN UP SO LONG
THAT LIKE WHENEVER I WOULD SEE A

29:04.275 --> 29:07.724
BLACK PERSON, THERE WOULD BE ONE
AND THEY WOULD BE LIGHT SKINNED

29:07.758 --> 29:11.137
WITH LIGHT GREEN EYES AND CURLY
HAIR WITH A TEXTURE NOBODY I

29:11.172 --> 29:13.172
KNOW HAS.
IT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT THE

29:13.206 --> 29:16.034
ONLY WAY YOU CAN CHANGE IT IS BY
JUST DOING IT.

29:16.068 --> 29:19.034
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
BE REPRESENTED ON TV AND IN MOVE

29:19.068 --> 29:22.344
WREES.
SO I UNDERSTAND HOW HE FEELS.

29:22.379 --> 29:24.482
TODRICK, I THINK WHAT YOU ARE
PITCHING IS A GREAT IDEA.

29:24.517 --> 29:27.413
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT,
WHEN YOU MAKE IT I WILL BE IN

29:27.448 --> 29:30.689
THE FRONT ROW CHECKING IT TOUT.
I WANT TO WRITE THE FIRST

29:30.724 --> 29:33.586
FAMILY FAIRY TALES THAT IS HAS
TWO MEN FALLING IN LOVE, WHICH I

29:33.620 --> 29:35.620
KNOW IS SUPER CONTROVERSY. MAYBE.

29:35.655 --> 29:39.551
THOSE MOVIES NEED TO EXIST.
AS A KID GROWING UP, I NEVER

29:39.586 --> 29:43.862
REALLY LIKE SAW AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT A GAY LOVE STORY COULD LOOK

29:43.896 --> 29:47.482
LIKE.
I HAD TO LEARN IT FROM GOING TO

29:47.517 --> 29:49.758
CLUBS AND NIGHTLIFE.
THERE IS A FUTURE GENERATION OF

29:49.793 --> 29:55.310
YOUNG KID THASES COULD BE PART
OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY

29:55.344 --> 29:57.413
DESERVE TO SEE AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT THEIR LOVE COULD LOOK LIKE

29:57.448 --> 30:00.448
SO THEY KNOWN WHEN THEY START TO
EXPERIENCE IT, THAT THEY ARE NOT

30:00.482 --> 30:02.655
WRONG, THEY ARE NOT A PROBLEM,
THEY ARE NOT A MISTAKE.

30:02.689 --> 30:05.896
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.
AND THERE IS LOVE AVAILABLE AND

30:05.931 --> 30:08.034
OUT THERE.
TWO MEN FALLING IN LOVE.

30:08.068 --> 30:11.724
IT JUST FEELS SUCH A TABOO
THING, BUT SOMEONE HAS TO BE THE

30:11.758 --> 30:14.827
FIRST PERSON TO DO IT TO REALIZE
THAT LIFE WILL STILL GO ON AND

30:14.862 --> 30:18.793
KIDS WILL LOOK AT IT AND BE LIKE
WOW, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE

30:18.827 --> 30:20.103
STORY.
TODRICK IS A BEAUTIFUL SOUL.

30:20.137 --> 30:24.034
I LOVE THE IDEA THAT TODRICK
WANTS TO ADD 20 MILLION OPTIONS

30:24.068 --> 30:26.448
TO HOW YOU CAN BE A STAR IN YOUR LIFE.

30:26.482 --> 30:28.827
AND THAT IS WHAT TODRICK IS, HE
IS A STAR.

30:28.862 --> 30:31.448
PEOPLE WERE PROBABLY LIKE CAN
YOU IMAGINE A BLACK PRINCESS.

30:31.482 --> 30:33.034
PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT IS NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

30:33.068 --> 30:36.034
BUT IT HAS HAPPENED NOW.
IT IS JUST, IT WILL TAKE TIME.

30:36.068 --> 30:40.551
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE IN OUR
LIFETIME BUT ALSO THINGS ARE

30:40.586 --> 30:47.172
PROGRESSING QUITE QUICKLY.
JUST WRITE IT THEN.

30:47.206 --> 30:55.103
YEAH.
THIS GAME IS SO CRAZY.

30:55.137 --> 30:58.413
IT CHANGES CONSTANTLY.
OH MY GOD.

30:58.448 --> 31:01.724
THAT IS WHY I GOT TO TRY TO
WIN NEXT WEEK.

31:01.758 --> 31:09.758
NOW THAT I WON THE VETO, HAVE
I TO START THINKING ABOUT MY END

31:09.793 --> 31:12.655
GAME.
THAT CHANGES.

31:12.689 --> 31:17.206
IF I WIN THAT NEXT H.O.H. I'M
GOING AFTER TODRICK AND MIESHA,

31:17.241 --> 31:26.241
ONE OF THEM HAS TO GO HOME.
PREFERABLY TODRICK.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.862
100%.
YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE

31:29.896 --> 31:45.793
OF BEATING MIESHA.
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,.

31:45.827 --> 31:50.827
KIRKPATRICK IS NOT GOING TO
VOTE FOR HER.

31:50.862 --> 31:54.689
BY THE GRACE OF GOD I'M STILL
IN THE HOUSE AND I STILL HAVE A

31:54.724 --> 31:56.793
SHOT.
I AM READY TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE

31:56.827 --> 32:00.655
TO DO TO TRY TO TWIN THE GAME.
IF IT TWORKS OUT THAT IT ENDS UP

32:00.689 --> 32:04.862
BEING TODD AND MYSELF AGAINST
MIESHA AND TODRICK, THEN IT'S

32:04.896 --> 32:11.379
GAME ON.
THAT IS THE STRAT GEE.

32:11.413 --> 32:18.068
I THINK FEW OF US CAN BEATER HER.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.551
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO ME.

32:19.586 --> 32:23.206
WHAT DO YOU WANT.
CAN WE GO TO MY ROOM.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.103
LET ME CHANGE CLOTHES FIRST.
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK, GIVE ME

32:26.137 --> 32:27.827
A SECOND.
TODD WINNING THE POWER OF

32:27.862 --> 32:30.724
VETO DEFINITELY THROUGH MIESHA
AND I OFF OUR GAME.

32:30.758 --> 32:33.689
SO I NEED TO SEE WHAT HE WANTS
TO DO WITH THE POV AND BASICALLY

32:33.724 --> 32:39.000
SEE WHERE HIS HEAD IS AT.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU

32:39.034 --> 32:45.103
WANT TO DO OR WHAT YOUR.
I DON'T KNOW, ONE OF US GOT

32:45.137 --> 32:47.620
TO GO HOME, I DON'T KNOW WHO.
I KNOW WHEN THEY GO HOME IT

32:47.655 --> 32:50.965
IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE.
I WOULD BE CRAZY NOT TO USE

32:51.000 --> 32:55.034
THE VETO ON ME, SO
UNFORTUNATELY, EITHER LAMAR OR

32:55.068 --> 32:58.068
CYNTHIA IS GOING TO GO HOME.
BUT BECAUSE I'M STAYING, I'M

32:58.103 --> 33:01.620
GOING TO BE BATTLING OUT THERE
TO WIN THE H.O.H. AND SEND

33:01.655 --> 33:06.310
SOMEBODY HOME.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, IF I

33:06.344 --> 33:08.241
WIN I'M GOING TO PUT BOTH OF YOU
TBIES UP.

33:08.275 --> 33:10.172
YOU WILL PUT ME AND MIESHA UP.

33:10.206 --> 33:22.551
OH HELL YEAH.

33:22.586 --> 33:27.172
AND I JUST TALKED TO HIM.
IF TODD WINS, HE WOULD PUT YOU

33:27.206 --> 33:30.344
AND I UP FOR SURE.
SEEING THAT TODD IS GOING TO

33:30.379 --> 33:34.172
BE IN THE HOUSE, TODRICK AND I
NEED TO REALLY THINK CAREFULLY

33:34.206 --> 33:36.655
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.

33:36.689 --> 33:40.827
IF TODRICK AND I DON'T WIN THESE
NEXT TWO COMPETITIONS, THAT

33:40.862 --> 33:44.827
COULD BE DEVASTATING FOR OUR END
GAME BECAUSE OF CYNTHIA OR TODD

33:44.862 --> 33:52.206
GETS CONTROL, WE MIGHT FIND BOTH
OF US UP ON THE BLOCK.

33:52.241 --> 33:59.379
BASICALLY HE JUST CAN'T WIN
TWO TIMES IN A ROW.

33:59.413 --> 34:03.827
Julie: UP NEXT, IT IS THE
LIVE VETO MEETING.

34:03.862 --> 34:08.241
THEN TWO LIVE EVICTIONS WILL
SEND TWO CELEBRITIES HOME.

34:08.275 --> 34:09.000
STAY WITH US.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.448
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

34:27.482 --> 34:31.310
TODD HAS WON THE POWER OF VETO
AND WILL LIKELY USE IT IT TO

34:31.344 --> 34:34.137
TAKE HIMSELF OFF THE BLOCK.
LET'S GO TO THE LIVING ROOM FOR

34:34.172 --> 34:37.689

HI JULIE.
SO WHEN I STARTED THIS JOURNEY I

37:29.586 --> 37:32.241
PROMISED MY HUSBAND THAT I
WOULDN'T GET SENT HOME FIRST.

AND SHOW MADE IT TO THE FINAL

37:37.000 --> 37:39.034

37:39.068 --> 37:41.413

42:08.275 --> 42:10.517

Julie: HE KIND OF GOT ME

42:10.551 --> 42:12.241
TOO.
HE DID, HE DID A GOOD JOB.

42:12.275 --> 42:16.137
HE'S A GREAT ACTOR JDZ SO BUT
BEFORE THAT WHOLE RUN UP WHERE

42:16.172 --> 42:18.931
HE WAS TRYING TO DO A
MS. DIRECT, DID YOU THINK YOU

42:18.965 --> 42:22.724
WERE GOING TO GET EVICTED
TONIGHT OR DID YOU THINK I'M

42:22.758 --> 42:25.413
GOOD?
CUZ I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM.

42:25.448 --> 42:27.965
YOU KNOW, IN THIS GAME YOU
REALLY NEVER KNOW.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.379
YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

42:31.413 --> 42:34.344
BUT I'M PREPARED.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

42:34.379 --> 42:39.413
Julie: AT THE END OF THE
DAY, WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR FORM

42:39.448 --> 42:45.241
ERAT LET ALLIANCE MEMBERS VOTED
TO KEEP CYNTHIA AND NOT LAMAR

42:45.275 --> 42:49.103
ODOM.
WELL, I THINK BECAUSE I WAS

42:49.137 --> 42:54.241
TELLING THEM IF I HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ONE OF THE

42:54.275 --> 42:59.137
FINALISTS, THAT MY INNER MAMBA
WAS GOING TO SURFACE AND THEY

42:59.172 --> 43:02.068
WOULDN'T HAVE A SHOT.
Julie: WHY DID YOU TELL

43:02.103 --> 43:04.103
THEM THAT.
I TRIED TO BE AS TRANSPARENT

43:04.137 --> 43:07.000
AS POSSIBLE ON THE SHOW, I THINK
THEY RESPECT FEE MORE THAT, I

43:07.034 --> 43:09.310
HOPE THEY WILL RESPECT ME FOR THAT.

43:09.344 --> 43:11.758
Julie: YOU SEEMED TO PLAY
THIS GAME UNDER THE RADAR, AT

43:11.793 --> 43:14.103
TIMES YOU SEESMED A LITTLE
CONFUSED ABOUT HOW TO PLAY THE

43:14.137 --> 43:15.379
GAME.
YEAH.

43:15.413 --> 43:21.275
Julie: YOU KNOW, DID YOU
TRULY HAVE AN ALLY IN THIS GAME

43:21.310 --> 43:26.172
IN YOUR OPINION?
I WAS JUST ALWAYS REALLY BY

43:26.206 --> 43:28.241
MYSELF.
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I WANTED

43:28.275 --> 43:30.586
IT IT TO BE.
I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO GET TOO

43:30.620 --> 43:34.586
CLOSE TO ANYONE, TO HAVE TO DULT
THEIR THROAT OR SLICE THEIR

43:34.620 --> 43:37.275
WRIST AT THE END OF THE DAY.
Julie: BUT WE DID SEE A

43:37.310 --> 43:40.034
REALLY NICE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
YOU AND TODD BRIDGES.

43:40.068 --> 43:44.827
YEAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID,
BEFORE PEOPLE COME INTO QULUR

43:44.862 --> 43:50.068
LIFE FOR A REASON, AND TODD HAS
BEEN SOBER FOR 33 YEARS NOW, SO

43:50.103 --> 43:51.758
I ASKED HIM TO BE MY SOBER COACH.

43:51.793 --> 43:58.000
SO MAYBE THAT IS WHY I JOINED
THE "CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER" CAST

43:58.034 --> 44:00.724
BECAUSE SOBRIETY IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME AT THIS POINT IN

44:00.758 --> 44:02.103
MY LIFE.

THAT IN THIS HOUSE TO GET BY
EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT'S SO

44:50.965 --> 44:52.448

DOWNS.
BUT I'M LEAVING, FEELING GOOD

44:54.482 --> 44:57.413

STRATEGIZE.

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:54.137
GOOD JOB TODRICK.
MIESHA HAS WON THE POV, BUT WILL

1:10:54.172 --> 1:10:58.655
SHE CHANGE HER OWN NOMINATIONS?
AND WHO WILL BE THE SECOND

1:10:58.689 --> 1:11:01.310
HOUSEGUEST TO BE EVICTED TONIGHT.

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:10.344

Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

1:11:31.758 --> 1:11:36.034
MIESHA HAS JUST WON THE POWER OF
VETO BUT WILL SHE USE IT TO

1:11:36.068 --> 1:11:38.931
CHANGE HER OWN NOMINATION?
LET'S RETURN TO THE LIVING ROOM

1:11:38.965 --> 1:11:42.896

SO AS THE VETO WINNER, YOU MAY
REMOVE ONE OF YOUR TWO NOMINEES

1:11:52.965 --> 1:11:56.931
FROM THE CHOPPING BLOCK OR YOU
MAY LEAVE YOUR NOMINATIONS IN

1:11:56.965 --> 1:11:59.448
PLACE.
SO MIESHA, PLEASE STAND, GO IT

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:04.793

Julie: THANK YOU, MIESHA.
ALL RIGHT HOUSEGUESTS, SINCE THE

1:12:22.793 --> 1:12:26.068

1:14:06.827 --> 1:14:08.034
OKAY.
I PLAYED WITH BOTH OF YOU GUYS,

1:14:08.068 --> 1:14:11.413
WE HAD A GREAT GAME, BUT
TODRICK, YOU BY FAR PLAYED THE

1:14:11.448 --> 1:14:13.482
BEST GAME THAN ANYBODY IN THIS
DANG HOUSE.

1:14:13.517 --> 1:14:15.758

1:14:15.793 --> 1:14:17.586
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU BOTH.
ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME FOR THE

LIVE VOTING TO BEGIN.
- MIESHA,
- S AHEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, YOU

1:14:26.344 --> 1:14:30.448
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE.
NEITHER ARE THE TWO NOMINEES.

1:14:30.482 --> 1:14:36.000
THAT LEAVES YOU TODRICK.
AND REMEMBER BY CHOOSING TO

1:14:36.034 --> 1:14:39.275
EVICT ONE OF THE NOMINEES, YOU
ARE ALSO DECIDING WHO WILL JOIN

1:14:39.310 --> 1:14:44.827
YOU AND MIESHA ON FINALE NIGHT.
SO TODRICK, PLEASE STAND UP, GO

1:14:44.862 --> 1:14:51.551
TO THE FRONT OF THE LIVING ROOM
AND CAST THE SOLE VOTE TO HE

1:14:51.586 --> 1:14:55.413
VIBLGHT.
TODD, I HAVE NOT HAD VERY

1:14:55.448 --> 1:14:59.655
MANY EXPERIENCES WITH BLACK
STRAIGHT MEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

1:14:59.689 --> 1:15:02.551
AND YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME SO MUCH
ABOUT CULTURE AND ABOUT BEING IN

1:15:02.586 --> 1:15:04.586
THIS INDUSTRY.
YOU HAVE BEEN A TRAIL BLAZER AND

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:07.103
HAVE PAVEED THE WAY FOR SO MANY
PEOPLE THAT LOOK IKE US.

1:15:07.137 --> 1:15:09.689
WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO MAKE A
BLACK ALLIANCE BUT THE FACT THAT

1:15:09.724 --> 1:15:12.862
THERE ARE FOUR OF US IN THE
FINAL FIVE IS LIKE SOMETHING

1:15:12.896 --> 1:15:16.344
THAT MI SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF.
BUT WHEN I WALKED IN HERE, I

1:15:16.379 --> 1:15:19.482
FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL
BLACK CHOCOLATE PRINCESS.

1:15:19.517 --> 1:15:22.551
AND I PROMISED CARSON WHEN WE
GAVE HIM THE BOOT THAT I WOULD

1:15:22.586 --> 1:15:26.793
WERE TECT HER AT ALL COSTS SO I
COULD PROTECT UNTIL I COULD

1:15:26.827 --> 1:15:28.896
PROTECT HER NO LONGER.
SO TODD, MY UNCLED TODD, MY WHAT

1:15:28.931 --> 1:15:32.103
YOU TALK ABOUT WILLIS, TODD.
I KNOW YOU HATE THAT.

1:15:32.137 --> 1:15:35.379
YOU HAD TO SAY IT TWNS I
SADLY VOTE TO EVICT YOU.

1:15:35.413 --> 1:15:38.103
NO PROBLEM, I'M GOOD.
Julie: IT'S OFFICIAL, TODD,

1:15:38.137 --> 1:15:42.724
YOU ARE EVICTED FROM "THE BIG
BANG THEORY" HOUSE.

1:15:42.758 --> 1:15:44.793
- FROM THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

1:15:44.827 --> 1:15:48.034
I LOVE YOU, ENJOY THAT CELL PHONE.

1:15:48.068 --> 1:15:51.448

1:15:51.482 --> 1:15:53.862
MAN-- A CELL PHONE.

1:15:53.896 --> 1:16:00.896

I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE INSTEAD
OF THERE.

1:16:13.517 --> 1:16:15.724
>>Julie: I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
HUG YOU.

1:16:15.758 --> 1:16:20.310
I KNOW, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Julie: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

1:16:20.344 --> 1:16:24.862
THIS IS INSANE.
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS

1:16:24.896 --> 1:16:30.724
HAPPENING?

1:16:30.758 --> 1:16:36.862
OH MY GOD.
I STILL DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT

1:16:36.896 --> 1:16:38.586
IS.
OKAY.

1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:41.034
OH MY GOD, ARE YOU WATCHING
THIS?

1:16:41.068 --> 1:16:52.827
HOW AM I EVEN STILL HERE.
CRAZY!

1:16:52.862 --> 1:16:59.448
CHEESIER CHEESIER-- CHEESIER,
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, SO

1:16:59.482 --> 1:17:00.896
STRESSFUL.
Julie: ALL RIGHT, TODD,

1:17:00.931 --> 1:17:04.827
JUST NOW WHEN I GAVE YOU THE
FLOOR YOU SAID TO TODRICK, YOU

1:17:04.862 --> 1:17:06.034
PLAYED THE BEST GAME.
OH YEAH.

1:17:06.068 --> 1:17:07.206
Julie: DID YOU REALLY MEAN THAT.

1:17:07.241 --> 1:17:08.758
OH YEAH.
Julie: YOU WEREN'T TRYING

1:17:08.793 --> 1:17:10.655
TO WORK FOR A VOTE. NO.

1:17:10.689 --> 1:17:12.793
Julie: J DO YOU THINK HE
PLAYED BETTER.

1:17:12.827 --> 1:17:16.206
BECAUSE TODRICK HAD FRIENDS
WITH EVERYBODY, MADE SOME

1:17:16.241 --> 1:17:20.896
ENEMIES BUT THEN MADE FRIENDS,
HE MADE ENEMIES AND THEN MADE

1:17:20.931 --> 1:17:22.931
FRIENDS AGAIN, HE WORKED
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE, HE WORKED

1:17:22.965 --> 1:17:25.758
THE HOUSE, THAT IS THE BETION
WAY TO WIN THIS GAME WHEN I

1:17:25.793 --> 1:17:28.655
WATCHED IT.
HE DID A GREAT JOB WORKING THE

1:17:28.689 --> 1:17:29.931
HOUSE.
Julie: YOU REFERRED TO

1:17:29.965 --> 1:17:32.034
EARLIER TONIGHT THAT A LINE WAS
DRAWN IN THE SAND.

1:17:32.068 --> 1:17:36.172
YEAH.
Julie: WHEN DID YOU REALIZE

1:17:36.206 --> 1:17:38.275
THERE IS A LINE AND I'M ON THIS SIDE.

1:17:38.310 --> 1:17:41.310
I KNEW IT BEFORE I WON THE
VETO, A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE

1:17:41.344 --> 1:17:46.068
THAT THAT THOSE TWO WOULD TRY TO
PULL EACH OTHER UP, MIESHA AND

1:17:46.103 --> 1:17:47.241
TODRICK.
Julie: HOW DID YOU FEEL

1:17:47.275 --> 1:17:49.000
ABOUT THAT.
I WAS OKAY WITH IT, YOU KNOW,

1:17:49.034 --> 1:17:52.827
BUT I BATTLED BACK AND WON THE
VETO TO COME BACK IN AND FIGHT

1:17:52.862 --> 1:17:55.896
SOME MORE BUTTY MATILY I'M JUST
REALLY HAPPY THAT I PLAYED A

1:17:55.931 --> 1:17:58.482
GREAT GAME BECAUSE I PLAYED A
GOOD GAME, TO GET DOWN TO THE

1:17:58.517 --> 1:18:01.517
FINAL FOUR.
PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

1:18:01.551 --> 1:18:04.034
YES, YOU DID.
TO GET TO HERE, I'M HAPPY TO

1:18:04.068 --> 1:18:07.206
BE GOING HOME, TO SEE MY FAMILY.
Julie: DID YOU AT ALL FEEL

1:18:07.241 --> 1:18:11.172
BETRAYED BY ANYONE AT ANY POINT?
AND IF SO, WHO?

1:18:11.206 --> 1:18:14.586
WELL, I FELT BETRAYED BY
MIESHA AND TODRICK AT FIRST BUT

1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:18.206
THEN I KNOW IT'S A GAME.
AND THEY HAVE TO GET THE

1:18:18.241 --> 1:18:20.724
STRONGEST PERSON OUT WHO CAN WIN
WITH THEM.

1:18:20.758 --> 1:18:22.931
BECAUSE I GUESS I HAVE BEEN
WINNING SOME GAMES TOO, SO THEY

1:18:22.965 --> 1:18:26.620
HAD TO GET RID OF ME TOO BECAUSE
THE FINALE CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR

1:18:26.655 --> 1:18:30.068
THEM, BOTH OF THEM.
Julie: YOU DON'T REGRET

1:18:30.103 --> 1:18:32.827
WINNING NIL COMPETITIONS, NO.
NOPE, I HAD A GREAT TIME.

1:18:32.862 --> 1:18:37.482
Julie: NOW IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU KIND OF MOVED IN AND YOU

1:18:37.517 --> 1:18:40.448
WERE LAYING LOW AND THEN, THEN
YOU SHOWED UP.

1:18:40.482 --> 1:18:42.034
YEAH.
Julie: WAS THAT YOUR

1:18:42.068 --> 1:18:42.862
STRATEGY.
YES.

1:18:42.896 --> 1:18:44.137
Julie: WAS THAT YOUR INTENTION.

1:18:44.172 --> 1:18:47.034
MY INTENTION STRATEGY WAS TO
SLEEP A LITTLE BIT, BUT LISTEN

1:18:47.068 --> 1:18:49.862
TO EVERYONE.
MAKE A LITTLE FUS, CAUSE

1:18:49.896 --> 1:18:52.862
DISRUPTIONS, MAKE PEOPLE THINK
THAT I WAS JUST AN ANGRY PERSON,

1:18:52.896 --> 1:18:55.034
BUT I WASN'TS LISTENING.
I WAS ALWAYS LISTENING TO WHAT

1:18:55.068 --> 1:18:57.448
THEY WERE SAYING, ALWAYS, AND
FIGURING OUT.

1:18:57.482 --> 1:18:59.827
AND I HAD ALIGNED WITH MIESHA EARLY.

1:18:59.862 --> 1:19:03.586
AND I KNEW TODRICK HAD, BUT AS I
WATCHED TODRICK PLAY HIS GAME, I

1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:06.586
COULDN'T PLAY MY GAME THE SAME
WAY AS HIM.

1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:08.896
SO.
Julie: WAS THIS A

1:19:08.931 --> 1:19:10.000
LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE FOR
YOU?

1:19:10.034 --> 1:19:12.241
OH YES, THIS IS SOMETHING I
WILL NEVER DO AGAIN.

1:19:12.275 --> 1:19:15.275
I CANNOT GIVE UP ALL MY STUFF TO
BE SOMEWHERE.

1:19:15.310 --> 1:19:19.689
I'M 56 YEARS OLD, 57 SOON.
THIS IS REALLY PROBABLY THE-- I

1:19:19.724 --> 1:19:21.379
WAS THE OLDEST PERSON IN THE HOUSE.

1:19:21.413 --> 1:19:23.241
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST THING FOR
ME TO DO.

1:19:23.275 --> 1:19:26.827
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU ARE STUCK
IN YOUR WAYS, YOU WANT CERTAIN

1:19:26.862 --> 1:19:30.000
THINGS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
AND I WAS LIKE, I DID OKAY.

1:19:30.034 --> 1:19:33.758
I WAS DOING GREAT, THEN
HORRIBLE, THEN GREAT, HORRIBLE,

1:19:33.793 --> 1:19:36.344
I AM JUST GLAD I GOT THIS
EXPERIENCE AND PLAY AND HAVE A

1:19:36.379 --> 1:19:38.689
GREAT TIME SO.
Julie: IT WAS REALLY FUN

1:19:38.724 --> 1:19:40.241
WATCHING YOU AND LAMAR.
OH YEAH.

1:19:40.275 --> 1:19:43.379
Julie: YOU NEED LIKE A
SITCOM TOGETHER OR SOMETHING.

1:19:43.413 --> 1:19:47.379
IS HE NOW A LIFELONG FRIEND.
YES, HE IS, LAMAR IS

1:19:47.413 --> 1:19:50.310
DEFINITELY A LIFELONG FRIEND.
I CAN'T WAIT TO TALK TO HIM AND

1:19:50.344 --> 1:19:52.034
SEE HIM.
Julie: FINAL THOUGHTS?

1:19:52.068 --> 1:19:55.482
FINAL THOUGHTS IS I DON'T
KNOW WHO I AM GIVING MY VOTE TO

1:19:55.517 --> 1:19:57.310
YET.
I HAVE A FEELING WHO IS GOING TO

1:19:57.344 --> 1:20:00.965
BE ON TOP.
BUT YOU KNOW, I COMPROMISED

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.758
MIESHA IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY I
THINK TODRICK PLAYED A BETTER

1:20:05.793 --> 1:20:08.620
GAME.
Julie: YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED

1:20:08.655 --> 1:20:10.000
TO SAY THAT NOW.
OH, SORRY.

1:20:10.034 --> 1:20:12.827
Julie: THEY STILL HAVE TO
MAKE A SPEECH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

1:20:12.862 --> 1:20:15.965
HE PLAYED WELL.
YOU GOT TO TIP YOUR HAT TO

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.448
SOMEBODY WHO PLAYS, WHO STAYED
UNDER THE KSH KSH ALIGNED WITH

1:20:19.482 --> 1:20:22.827
MIESHA, ALIGNED WITH ME.
SO THAT I WOULDN'T PUT HIM UP.

1:20:22.862 --> 1:20:25.724
HE LINED WITH CARSON, IT WAS A
GREAT THING TO DO.

1:20:25.758 --> 1:20:28.724
Julie: IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
WATCHING YOU ON TRK V AS A KID

1:20:28.758 --> 1:20:30.034
FOR ME.
THANK YOU.

1:20:30.068 --> 1:20:31.827
Julie: AND HERE AGAIN.
APPRECIATE IT IT DISWRZ THANK

1:20:31.862 --> 1:20:35.379
YOU SO MUCH, TODD BRIDGES, WE
WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE IN TWO

1:20:35.413 --> 1:20:37.448
NIGHTS, WHEN YOU DO VOTE, DON'T
TELL US.

1:20:37.482 --> 1:20:39.275
TWO NIGHTSK HAVE I TO COME BACK.

1:20:39.310 --> 1:20:42.724
Julie: YES, YOU DO.
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT,

1:20:42.758 --> 1:20:44.172
JULIE.
Julie: STAY RIGHT THERE.

1:20:44.206 --> 1:20:48.793
I HAVE A VERY QUICK BUT
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOU AT HOME.

1:20:48.827 --> 1:20:53.068
SINCE CHRIS CATAN LEFT THE GAME
EARLY, THE JURY WILL CONSIST OF

1:20:53.103 --> 1:20:58.655
