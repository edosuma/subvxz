WEBVTT

01:09.486 --> 01:10.487
<i>One, two, three.</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:14.199
<i>That was cool.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:18.161
<i>What is this?</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:19.788
<i>Open wide.</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:37.305
I couldn't be happier.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.641
I'm happy too.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.031
Hye-jin.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.368
Hye-jin?

02:57.135 --> 02:58.136
You're happy?

03:00.138 --> 03:03.057
Do you think you deserve to be happy?

03:29.626 --> 03:30.627
Chief Hong.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.046
Chief Hong?

03:42.555 --> 03:43.389
What's wrong?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.350
Was it a nightmare?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.268
Yes, a nightmare.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.604
A very bad one.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.565
Goodness.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.984
Were you scared by a nightmare?

03:55.568 --> 03:59.489
It's all right. They say nightmares
are signs that you'll grow taller.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.616
What time is it?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.786
About 4:30 a.m.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.747
What?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.542
Why are you here so early?
Is something up?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.464
EPISODE 12

04:16.547 --> 04:17.632
No way.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.218
The sun has already risen?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.804
Yes, see how bright it is.

04:23.388 --> 04:27.976
Damn it. I wanted
to watch the sunrise with you.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.646
The forecast said we'd have a clear sky.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.148
Weather by the shore
is always unpredictable.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.317
What's with the sudden urge
to see the sunrise?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.361
I just wanted to.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.739
-Shall we come again tomorrow?
-Again? Tomorrow?

04:41.823 --> 04:44.575
Yes, let's come here every morning

04:44.659 --> 04:46.995
until we finally see a clear sunrise.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.830
Hold on. Look over there.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.500
Can't you see the sun behind the clouds?

04:53.334 --> 04:54.252
Where?

04:54.335 --> 04:56.462
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.507
Don't you see reddish colors spreading?

05:00.091 --> 05:00.925
I don't.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.095
You need to focus
as if you're looking at autostereograms.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.680
Look.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.515
I really don't see it.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.147
I knew there wasn't anything there!

05:14.230 --> 05:16.858
No, look. Right over there.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.694
-You can't see a thing!
-Look.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.323
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

05:31.164 --> 05:32.915
What are you working so hard on?

05:33.416 --> 05:36.210
Well, it's this.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.254
Ta-da.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.675
What's this? "100 Things
I Want to Do with My Boyfriend"?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.886
A bucket list.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.723
Seriously? No one makes
lists like this these days.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.558
-What?
-And in Excel?

05:50.641 --> 05:55.438
You know how I give it my best and
then some when starting a new thing.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.065
Besides, it's fun.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.943
But you're missing
the most important thing.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.195
What's that?

06:03.321 --> 06:06.449
Going all the way.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.951
Gosh, you're gross.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.578
Go all the way.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.872
Come on. Stop saying that.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.960
You know, we're trying to
get to know each other very slowly.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.213
Connecting our souls comes first.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.173
That's ridiculous.

06:22.256 --> 06:26.177
The end goal
to a romantic relationship is lovemaking.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.263
Platonic love has nothing on eros.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.973
Unbelievable.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.101
-Is anybody here?
-Coming!

06:35.436 --> 06:37.563
She can be such a pervert sometimes.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.735
Eros?

06:44.028 --> 06:46.030
DRYING EACH OTHER'S HAIR,
BEING UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA…

06:50.493 --> 06:53.663
Ms. Yeo!

06:55.164 --> 06:59.460
Goodness, Bo-ra. Do you have no homework
today? Why are you so excited?

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
No, that's not it.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.006
I-jun won a prize!

07:04.090 --> 07:05.216
What?

07:06.467 --> 07:07.426
Goodness.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.681
Let me see.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.101
I won the silver prize
at the mathematics competition.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.603
I can see that.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.940
Chang I-jun in Class One, Grade Two
of Cheongjin Elementary School.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.318
My son, Chang I-jun. This is amazing!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.904
I-jun, you did great.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.656
I'm proud of you.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.410
I-jun, aren't you happy
about winning this prize?

07:33.411 --> 07:34.454
I am.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.957
Ms. Yeo, this is I-jun being really happy.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.793
His mouth is usually…

07:42.670 --> 07:44.213
like this.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.550
But now, the corners
of his lips are slightly raised.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.846
Is that so? I-jun, did you tell your dad?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.141
-No.
-Then tell him yourself.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.268
I'll video call him for you.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.200
Gosh.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.368
Have you lost your mind?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.913
Why are you spooking me
with a video call--

08:17.455 --> 08:21.209
<i>Hey, I-jun! It's Dad.</i>

08:22.251 --> 08:25.880
Did you ask your mom
to make a video call for you?

08:26.756 --> 08:30.009
Dad, I won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

08:30.092 --> 08:34.514
What? You won a prize
at the mathematics competition?

08:34.597 --> 08:39.435
<i>My gosh.
I must've given birth to a genius!</i>

08:40.811 --> 08:43.731
-I'm the one who gave birth to him.
-Well, I contributed.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.983
Watch your mouth in front of him.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.321
Anyway, make some time this weekend
for I-jun's party.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.157
<i>Right. Of course.</i>

08:53.241 --> 08:57.161
<i>I-jun, we'll get together this weekend
and have a feast. Okay?</i>

08:57.954 --> 08:58.955
Sure.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.916
Good going, my boy. I'll see you then!

09:01.999 --> 09:05.670
Ms. Yeo, look at him.
You can see that he's smiling.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.587
Yes, I see.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.298
No, I'm not.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.925
Yes, you are.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.594
The smile's even bigger now.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.555
My gosh.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.931
Mr. Chang!

09:17.431 --> 09:20.560
Yong-hun, hear this. I-jun won a prize

09:20.643 --> 09:22.687
at the mathematics competition.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.398
That's great! You must be so proud of him.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.109
Let me reward you
for having a great son then.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.610
What? How?

09:29.694 --> 09:31.946
They say it's good for the joints.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.075
You had it rough
when you pulled your back a while ago.

09:36.158 --> 09:36.993
Gosh.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.795
Hold on. Why are you
giving me this though?

09:47.878 --> 09:50.464
Just go ahead and try it first.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.225
Do you already feel better?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.268
I get it.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.771
I know why you're doing this.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.190
What do you mean?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.527
This is because of
the Best Employee Award, right?

10:14.739 --> 10:18.576
You idiot. I'm not the one
who decides who gets it.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.121
The residents will vote on it.
How stupid can you be?

10:22.997 --> 10:23.831
You got me.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.585
Still, make sure you drink these.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.757
Guys, my I-jun…

10:44.143 --> 10:46.395
Chief Hong, how about a cup of coffee?

10:46.479 --> 10:47.605
Sounds good.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.315
-I'll go get it.
-Sure.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.199
You're a life-saver, Chief Hong.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.326
-Nonsense.
-Will you help for a few more days?

11:00.409 --> 11:02.745
Of course. One shouldn't
bother picking up a saw

11:02.828 --> 11:05.122
if he's not going to
at least build a table.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.418
Are you throwing those out?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.836
Yes, that's right.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.215
What a waste. Some of them
even have growth ring patterns.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.888
Chief Hong!

11:21.972 --> 11:23.724
You're home!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.935
You came in without permission again?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.728
Pay rent if you'll keep doing it.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.438
Maybe I will.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.690
Anyway, go wash up.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.569
Wash up?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.405
-Yes.
-Why?

11:37.988 --> 11:39.824
There's something we must do today.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.136
Is this what you meant?

12:00.219 --> 12:02.513
Yes, through couples yoga,

12:03.097 --> 12:05.975
we can build intimacy
and enhance our flexibility.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.519
I bet it's ended a few relationships.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.772
It's tough, that's all.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.609
Unbelievable.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.153
Fine.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.156
-Next pose.
-Could we please stop?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.950
-Our knees--
-But I'm exhausted.

12:23.033 --> 12:26.495
Bend your knees
and let the soles of our feet meet.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.997
You're completely ignoring me.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.207
That's it. Then we look
each other in the eye.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.877
-Right.
-Now, grab my wrists.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.129
-Like this?
-Hold my wrists

12:35.212 --> 12:36.881
and gradually straighten this leg.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.008
-One, two, three!
-Straighten my leg?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.511
No, I can't! God, it hurts!

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847
This is just wrong.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.682
I just pulled something.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.018
-You pulled something?
-It hurts like crazy.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.437
There. Now it's back to normal.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.775
All right, fine.
Sit with your legs crossed next.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.154
And face me.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.490
Is this another yoga pose?

13:02.573 --> 13:04.950
Yes. We'll meditate.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.537
Place your hands on your knees.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.416
Close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.460
This is my favorite pose.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.802
You look so much like a dog.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.725
-A dog?
-That's right. A big one.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.020
With your fair skin and double eyelids.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.438
Like a countryside mutt.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.148
Oh, that kind of dog.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.610
Meanwhile, you're more like a cat,

13:39.693 --> 13:43.280
but there are hints of a dog too.
You're mixed in between.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.658
Am I a "cat-dog" then?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.579
-Right.
-You're killing me.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.122
Look at your adorable dimple.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
You also have dimples too.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.462
Yours are deeper.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.715
Yours are cuter and deeper.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.801
Gosh.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.901
I haven't brushed my teeth.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.152
I don't care.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.698
Let's brush our teeth.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.075
-Together?
-Yes.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.080
We'll do it together?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.084
Wait, my knee really hurts.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.091
-I have a question.
-Okay.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.926
What on earth are we doing?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.762
What do you mean?
We're brushing our teeth.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.516
I know, but why are you
brushing my teeth for me?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.809
Isn't this romantic?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.811
This? How so?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.187
You just don't know yet.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.274
Once we get used to it,
it'll be as sweet as strawberries.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.527
Since we're at it,

15:03.611 --> 15:06.196
let's do it properly. Here.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.493
Hey, you're getting it all over!

15:12.036 --> 15:13.495
Well, my gums are bleeding.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.789
My gosh, Chief Hong.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.208
No wonder I was getting a bitter taste.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.669
You've been making me
bleed often these days.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.712
Sorry.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.089
No, that's enough.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.426
Don't you dare propose
anything weird like this again. Stop.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.928
No way.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.306
<i>Ouch, ouch, does your teeth hurt?</i>

15:32.389 --> 15:34.767
-<i>Orange candy--</i>
-That's enough.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.436
Come on. Clean teeth are key to longevity.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.563
-Really?
-How adorable.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.108
-No way.
-Chief Hong, please try this on.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.235
-I don't want to.
-Won't it be cute?

15:45.319 --> 15:47.821
-Take a look.
-Where do you get these things?

15:47.905 --> 15:49.281
Okay, fine. Give it here.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.703
There's nothing I can do.
It's up there now.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.248
-Try it on just once.
-Seriously?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.834
-Please try it on.
-But I don't want to!

16:00.918 --> 16:02.169
I really don't want to.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.337
You're so annoying.

16:05.589 --> 16:09.093
There's no need to get upset though.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.511
-Will you put it on?
-No.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.641
Hold on. Just give me a second.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.645
Wait. You can't take it just yet.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.279
Putting makeup on a pumpkin?

16:29.947 --> 16:31.031
Did you call me a pumpkin?

16:31.573 --> 16:35.869
I mean, I find pumpkins
just so round and adorable.

16:35.953 --> 16:39.123
You're already so pretty.
This will make you even prettier.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.000
You have no idea.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.169
I'm sure Ju-ri will speak
casually to me tomorrow.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.421
"Hi, Hye-jin."

16:46.255 --> 16:47.464
She'll think I'm her age!

16:50.175 --> 16:52.219
She speaks casually
to everyone in Gongjin.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.762
You're right.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.514
-I'll apply some on you too.
-No way.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.683
-Why not?
-Let's take the photo.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.686
Get ready in one, two, three.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.230
One, two, three.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.275
I must ask. What's with that sound?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.776
-It's fun.
-Okay, I love it.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.194
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.238
One, two, three.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.406
Yippy.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.746
See? It looks nothing
like that old TV show.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.915
We look great in this one. Cute, right?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.000
Yes.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.544
Are you all right?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.838
A middle schooler can handle it.

17:27.921 --> 17:28.922
It's cute.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.550
-The photos are cute.
-They are.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.054
What else should we do?
Buy groceries and cook?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.139
Read comic books?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.600
What are you? A long-lasting battery?

17:39.683 --> 17:41.727
Do you run on batteries? Let me see.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.644
Are you tired?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.523
I surely am.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.734
Why don't we do nothing?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.820
We'll sit here and rest.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.866
Is there nothing you wish to do with me?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.160
What? I didn't mean it like that.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.162
I'm going home.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.790
Come on. Don't go.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.000
-No, I'm heading home. Bye.
-Hey.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.418
What's this?

18:08.837 --> 18:11.173
-Give that back.
-"See the sunrise together,

18:11.256 --> 18:13.092
couples yoga, give boyfriend a shave,

18:13.175 --> 18:14.802
-go to restaurants--"
-Give it back.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.805
You wanted to do all these with me?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.224
You even marked the ones we already did.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.101
Forget it. Just give it back.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.020
Let's do all of them.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.773
What?

18:29.358 --> 18:32.236
How can I not cave in
when you're this cute?

18:32.319 --> 18:34.029
-Really?
-Yes.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.367
What should we do first?
Should we do them from top to bottom?

18:40.828 --> 18:43.205
Wait, not today.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.000
How about we go on a date
to Seoul next weekend?

18:47.584 --> 18:48.669
A date?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.087
Yes, a date.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.797
Let's go.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.507
-Really?
-Sure.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.469
Brace yourself because
we'll be ticking a lot off the list.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.555
Prepare yourself.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.891
You can take your time, you know.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.852
Don't rush it.

19:05.352 --> 19:10.399
Let's do everything on the list from top
to bottom together for a long time.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.109
Sounds good.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.243
Like this and like that.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.079
There.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.457
Thanks, Dad.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.294
I-jun, eat your fill.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.754
Order more if you want.
It'll be my treat today.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.965
You talk big when it's just <i>tonkatsu</i>.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.467
It's called pork cutlet.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.679
Besides, I-jun ordered it,

19:40.762 --> 19:43.182
unlike you who had to
order expensive steak.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.683
So? Does it feel like a waste?

19:44.766 --> 19:46.226
I didn't say that.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.896
Just get eating.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.860
Mom.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.696
Yes, I-jun.
Is there something you'd like to say?

19:58.363 --> 19:59.990
Can I have a pet hedgehog?

20:00.073 --> 20:01.283
A hedgehog?

20:01.366 --> 20:04.328
Gosh, I-jun. Do you want a hedgehog?

20:04.411 --> 20:07.331
Yes, Dr. Yoon has been taking care

20:07.414 --> 20:09.791
of the hedgehog Bo-ra adopted.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.169
I was going to ask Mom for permission

20:12.252 --> 20:13.545
once I won the prize.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.796
I see.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.675
Sure thing. We'll do it.
Bring the hedgehog home.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.552
-Really?
-Of course.

20:21.178 --> 20:25.641
But I-jun, know that I'm not allowing it
because you won a prize.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.060
It's because you want it, that's all.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.689
We're not having a party
because you won a prize either.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.777
What are you saying?
I thought that's what this is for.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.736
We're not.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.449
I-jun, I'm so proud
that you won the prize.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.410
But we would be still doing this
even if you hadn't.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.706
What we're celebrating
is the fact that you worked hard.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.252
To me, that's more important
than the prize itself.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.962
I understand, Mom.

20:57.381 --> 21:01.176
That's right, I-jun.
You don't have to get good grades.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.138
All I want is for you
to have a happy childhood.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.683
Says the man
who told the whole neighborhood.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.351
I hear you told Yong-hun.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.770
That's because I was proud…

21:11.853 --> 21:13.605
How do you know that though?

21:14.856 --> 21:16.400
Just eat the damn food.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.484
The damn food?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.445
-Did you just say "damn"?
-I didn't.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.406
-You just said--
-Sorry.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.490
"Sorry"?

21:24.741 --> 21:26.118
-Is it good?
-It is.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.496
Is it good? Really? Then eat your fill.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.832
Eat as much as you want.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.587
-Hye-jin.
-Hello.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.965
-Are you going to work?
-Yes.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.176
You two must be here to shoot the show.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.013
Yes, we made it here early.

21:46.096 --> 21:50.600
It's so hot these days, so be careful
with heat stroke. Both of you.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.060
I will. Thanks.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.646
I'll get going then.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.732
Have a good day,
and don't skip your meals.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.817
-Right. You too.
-See you.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.277
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.585
Dr. Yoon!

22:16.668 --> 22:19.504
Hi, kids. You must be off to school.

22:19.588 --> 22:24.634
Yes. But you know what? I-jun won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.596
Really? Congratulations.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.017
So Bo-ra wasn't kidding about
you acing 100 tests.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.727
Thank you.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.396
I still lack in many ways though,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.274
so I'll keep
applying myself to my studies.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.650
You'll apply yourself?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.403
Anyway, his mom said
he could raise Seumseum at home.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.323
Really? When will you take it home then?

22:53.413 --> 22:56.166
What is it? Are you sad to see it go?

22:57.501 --> 22:58.543
A little.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.840
But I can't possibly fight with kids
over a hedgehog.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.593
I was only its temporary guardian,

23:06.676 --> 23:09.137
and I'm sure they'll take good care of it.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.100
Besides, Seumseum

23:13.642 --> 23:16.645
still raises its quills
when I try to touch it.

23:16.728 --> 23:20.148
Come to think of it,
you're no longer like a hedgehog.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.317
What?

23:22.400 --> 23:25.362
I mean, you used to raise
your sharp quills.

23:25.445 --> 23:29.783
But you don't raise them anymore
even when I pat you.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.910
That's not funny.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.580
You've changed a lot.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.292
You're not the same person you used to be.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.964
-How have I changed?
-What?

23:44.047 --> 23:45.841
Do I look different?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.885
Well, what I meant is--

23:48.969 --> 23:51.513
Gosh, I'm tired.
The kids must be here. I'll get it.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.640
-But I--
-Wait, I should take this with me.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.602
Seumseum doesn't like it when it's cold.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.147
The ideal temperature is 26°C,

24:00.230 --> 24:02.232
so always spread the blanket under it.

24:02.315 --> 24:06.027
Bo-ra and I-jun must be happy
to have a new friend.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.573
You have no idea, Uncle Du-sik.
I'll hang out at I-jun's place every day.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.741
You already do.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.411
Whatever. I'll still come over every day.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.414
Sure.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.126
We'll come by your place
with Seumseum often as well.

24:21.209 --> 24:25.672
Okay. Come by Uncle Du-sik's though.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.466
It has become my den these days.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.511
What, are you forming a group now?

24:31.595 --> 24:34.431
Come over if you want.
I'll make something delicious.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.475
I'd appreciate assorted tripe
and pork rinds.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.393
Noted.

24:39.019 --> 24:43.440
I see you don't have the palate
of a regular second grader.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.526
Bo-ra's one to enjoy byproducts.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.154
I see. How commendable.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.699
-So everyone is here.
-Yes.

24:52.782 --> 24:56.870
First, thank you all for attending
the emergency neighborhood meeting.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.330
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.791
What's so urgent that you had
to gather all these busy people?

25:01.875 --> 25:05.003
If you hadn't interrupted,
we'd be done by now.

25:05.086 --> 25:08.215
What is it, then?
The curiosity is killing me.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.383
Exactly. What's going on?

25:10.467 --> 25:15.013
It's just that Director Ji
asked for a favor.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.848
-What?
-Director Ji?

25:16.932 --> 25:20.769
For the next episode,
we're hoping to treat the village elders

25:20.852 --> 25:22.062
to a meal.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.396
-A meal?
-Yes.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.525
JUNE and In-u will cook themselves, and
we're thinking of inviting five people.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.610
-Five?
-Yes.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.488
And JUNE wants Ms. Gam-ri
to be one of them.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.281
He enjoyed her meal last time.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.618
I love how the young man thinks.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.870
Tell me about it. Anyway, could you decide

25:38.954 --> 25:41.206
on the other four
that are suitable for TV?

25:41.289 --> 25:42.916
Four? Sure thing.

25:45.043 --> 25:48.797
Anyway, that's why Ms. Gam-ri
is already on the list.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.884
Goodness. That really isn't necessary.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.595
It'll already be my second time on TV!

25:56.179 --> 25:57.639
But you love it!

25:57.722 --> 26:01.351
Director Ji put me in charge
of deciding on the other four.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.103
-Me!
-Me!

26:03.186 --> 26:05.981
-Me!
-I'm Oh Yoon, remember?

26:06.564 --> 26:09.401
-Me!
-Come on!

26:09.484 --> 26:11.945
Everybody, just calm down.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.657
Of course I should be on that list.
I'm the village chief.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.536
Don't be ridiculous.
The filming takes place in zone five,

26:19.619 --> 26:22.205
so the zone chief in her third term
should be invited.

26:22.289 --> 26:26.251
You're too SSS all the time
to be suitable for any variety show.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.420
SSS? What's that?

26:28.503 --> 26:30.213
Strict, stern, and serious. SSS.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.216
How can you be on TV
when you don't know this stuff?

26:33.300 --> 26:38.013
TV shows need a fun chatterbox like me
in order to get good ratings.

26:38.096 --> 26:42.642
-She's not wrong.
-What can bring good ratings?

26:42.726 --> 26:44.728
-A celebrity, of course.
-A celebrity?

26:44.811 --> 26:46.730
-Dad, please.
-I'm Oh Yoon.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.273
Once people hear about it,

26:48.356 --> 26:52.277
articles will flood portal sites
and the show will be the talk of any town.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.654
No. No way!

26:54.738 --> 26:55.739
-It should be me.
-Why?

26:55.822 --> 26:58.158
The show takes place in Gongjin,

26:58.241 --> 26:59.993
so a native should appear on it.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.244
-Just a second.
-No!

27:01.745 --> 27:04.998
I should make an appearance and prove
that even grannies can be pretty.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.293
-You're not wrong, but--
-When it comes to looks, I'm your man.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.754
If it weren't for Du-sik's
unnecessary good looks,

27:10.837 --> 27:14.090
I'd be considered handsome
when taken a closer look.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.801
Worrying about our unborn child
taking after you

27:16.885 --> 27:18.136
keeps me up at night.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.804
-You sleep perfectly fine.
-Me!

27:19.888 --> 27:22.349
My baby's due soon, and being on the show

27:22.432 --> 27:25.226
will be a huge gift to the baby.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.271
-Don't you agree?
-I want to be on TV too!

27:28.355 --> 27:30.565
I'm the DOS fan here.
I even know their songs.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.735
<i>Please come back, just a feeling</i>

27:33.818 --> 27:36.613
So you're saying
you all want to be on the show.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.366
-Me!
-No, me!

27:39.449 --> 27:41.576
-It should be me.
-No, me!

27:42.077 --> 27:44.662
-Do you have something to say?
-Count me out.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.706
-What?
-Same here.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.124
I'm good as well.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.085
-There you go.
-We have a better chance!

27:50.168 --> 27:53.213
Apart from the three of them,
everyone wants to be on the show.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.714
Yes, me!

27:54.798 --> 27:56.966
-There's only one option then.
-What is it?

27:57.050 --> 27:59.636
The fairest way
that no one will argue about.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.347
We'll draw names!

28:02.430 --> 28:04.099
-What?
-Unbelievable.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.934
-Seriously?
-It should be me.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.977
-No way.
-This is wrong.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.730
Hold on a second.
Ms. Yeo, you shouldn't be up there.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.191
How can a candidate
take part in the drawing process?

28:13.274 --> 28:16.194
Chief Hong is the host,
and I'm only his assistant.

28:16.277 --> 28:20.031
If I cheat, I swear I'll discard
my family name.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.574
-Gosh.
-Fine.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.868
We'll then decide the four residents

28:23.952 --> 28:27.247
that will join Ms. Gam-ri
on her adventure.

28:27.330 --> 28:31.459
Who is the first resident
to be on <i>The Seashore Grasshopper</i>?

28:34.838 --> 28:38.174
The anticipation is real,
so please give me some silence.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.509
-First…
-Unbelievable.

28:39.592 --> 28:43.346
-The star of Gongjin-dong.
-That's right.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.889
-Oh…
-It's me!

28:44.973 --> 28:45.932
Chun-jae.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.810
-Oh Yoon in the house!
-Congrats.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.563
-<i>Neener-neener</i>
-What the hell?

28:52.605 --> 28:55.233
Ju-ri, Daddy will be on TV!

28:55.316 --> 28:56.693
You're annoying like hell!

28:56.776 --> 28:59.237
Let me now draw the second name.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.739
-All right.
-The second name.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.909
I have the piece of paper.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.412
She's known to be quick-witted.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.622
-Then it's me.
-No, it's me.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.915
Cho Nam-suk!

29:11.875 --> 29:14.836
Goodness! What a wonderful evening it is.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.172
I'll introduce Gongjin to the world!

29:17.255 --> 29:21.426
Congratulations.
Let me now draw the third name.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.096
The third person will be…

29:25.180 --> 29:27.307
This person has been busy
with work these days.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.100
-Right.
-A person who works hard.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.270
It sure has been exhausting.
Thank you, my friend.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.730
Right. It's Ham Yun-gyeong!

29:34.814 --> 29:36.065
This is freaking amazing!

29:36.649 --> 29:38.276
Honey, what…

29:38.359 --> 29:39.778
The delinquent in her speaks.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.655
-My goodness. I guess I got carried away.
-My gosh.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.617
Anyway, thank you.
My unborn child will love it.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.993
I'm sorry, kids.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.288
-We only have one name left.
-The last.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.623
The last person.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.625
-The man of the hour.
-Exactly.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.627
-It has to be Ju-ri.
-Drum roll!

29:55.710 --> 29:59.547
-Please let it be me.
-I can't wait to see who it is myself.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.050
-Please.
-Who will it be?

30:02.133 --> 30:04.093
-Let me see.
-It must be me.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.514
-Darn it.
-What?

30:07.597 --> 30:09.474
Why did it have to be Chang Yeong-guk?

30:09.557 --> 30:11.559
-What?
-What the hell?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.686
Me? Is it really me?

30:16.105 --> 30:20.276
This is exactly why
one should be kind and generous.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.654
-Unbelievable!
-Yes, it's you.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.364
-You must be thrilled.
-I am.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.741
-No way. I won't allow it.
-Seriously.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.834
The filming will soon begin.
Don't be nervous,

30:35.917 --> 30:38.086
-and just act like you normally do.
-Right.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.839
Why are you all so nervous?

30:40.922 --> 30:43.716
Everybody, relax your facial muscles.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.386
It's my second time being on TV, right?

30:46.469 --> 30:49.430
So I'm not nervous at all.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.807
That pill…

30:51.683 --> 30:53.017
I'm not nervous at all.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.687
This is nothing compared to
when I talk with the mayor.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.397
-What's he looking at?
-I'm Oh Yoon.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.025
Did you know that I once performed
at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena?

31:01.109 --> 31:02.068
Follow my lead.

31:02.151 --> 31:04.529
You can worry about everyone else,
but not me.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.031
Honestly, I couldn't… be calmer.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.576
-I'm fine.
-Come on, Yun-gyeong.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.327
Loosen up a bit.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.495
-Honey.
-Yes?

31:12.579 --> 31:14.747
What if I go into labor while filming?

31:14.831 --> 31:16.165
That won't happen.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.667
Why are you all nervous?

31:17.750 --> 31:19.878
-Gosh.
-I won't, right?

31:20.461 --> 31:23.256
Chief Hong, will our show be all right?

31:23.923 --> 31:24.883
I'm not sure.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.636
-All right.
-Here we go.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.888
Yes, don't worry.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.514
-Hello.
-Hi.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.974
-I'm the village chief.
-Hello.

31:33.057 --> 31:33.892
My gosh!

31:34.517 --> 31:35.768
Goodness.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.478
-What is it?
-Are you all right?

31:38.062 --> 31:39.355
I'm sorry.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.609
-I'm sorry about that.
-Goodness.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.360
All right.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.073
It's good.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.034
-Yes, it's good.
-I know.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.035
How is it?

31:52.702 --> 31:54.662
-Are you asking me?
-Yes.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.539
Well, it's delicious.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.125
I can taste the flavors of the Gongjin sea

31:59.208 --> 32:01.586
even though it's pork belly.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.213
She seems so nervous.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.633
-Isn't it so hot, by the way?
-It is.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.594
I even had my hair done,
but now I'm sweating like crazy.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.930
Do I still look okay?
My hair should stay up.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.891
I feel like my hair isn't
how it's supposed to be.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.225
Nam-suk, lower your arms!

32:16.309 --> 32:17.685
Let's go!

32:17.769 --> 32:19.145
-Lower them.
-Don't worry.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.439
-Your shirt is wet.
-Good luck to you too.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.441
Oh, no. Nam-suk…

32:26.694 --> 32:28.321
-This is <i>pajeon</i>.
-Goodness.

32:28.404 --> 32:29.656
Eat it while it's hot.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.741
-Gosh, it looks great.
-Thank you.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.326
-It's your favorite.
-Exactly.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.203
-Please enjoy.
-Please enjoy.

32:35.286 --> 32:37.038
-Shit, that's hot as hell.
-Goodness.

32:41.918 --> 32:42.752
Sorry about that.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.421
We'll have to edit that out.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.340
Can't we beep it out?

32:47.423 --> 32:51.719
Anyway, thank you so much
for having us over.

32:53.304 --> 32:58.351
These are crabs that I marinated myself.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.979
Not everyone gets to eat that.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.272
-Thank you.
-Let's get a shot of that later.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.691
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

33:04.774 --> 33:05.900
Thank you.

33:05.984 --> 33:10.530
A gathering like this wouldn't be complete
without a few tunes.

33:10.613 --> 33:14.617
Let me sing a song
for my fellow singers here.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.245
-Is he a singer?
-Which one's the main camera?

33:17.328 --> 33:18.871
It's on you, so act naturally.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.915
-Chun-jae, go ahead.
-Right.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.375
He's a singer, you know.

33:23.876 --> 33:27.588
<i>I can't contain this feeling…</i>

33:27.672 --> 33:31.926
-Go, Chun-jae!
-Recently, I've done you wrong so often.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.594
Why? I'm loving this.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.014
It's raw and authentic.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.306
Even Nam-suk?

33:37.390 --> 33:40.393
<i>Brings me to tears</i>

33:40.476 --> 33:41.853
-I'll edit well.
-Please do.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.105
-Go, Chun-jae.
-She's too sweet, you see.

33:44.188 --> 33:47.400
-Go, Chun-jae!
-She keeps raising her arms to cheer.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.069
Come on in.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.531
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

33:53.614 --> 33:54.949
How was the shoot?

33:56.075 --> 34:00.329
Philosophically speaking,
one's dignity was thrown out the window.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.541
But as variety shows go, it'll be fun.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.585
It must've been rough out in the sun.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.879
Come on. Let me give you a hug.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.591
It wasn't that exhausting, but still…

34:13.593 --> 34:14.886
You did great.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.058
Hey, Mi-seon.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.143
You guys are super annoying.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.563
Mi-seon, I…

34:26.064 --> 34:27.065
Gosh.

34:27.732 --> 34:31.569
Unbelievable.
Hye-jin is just head over hells.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.279
Damn lovebirds.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.783
I really should get my own place.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.702
Eun-cheol.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.454
Ms. Pyo?

34:42.288 --> 34:43.539
Where are you going alone?

34:43.623 --> 34:46.834
I had to escape
a pair of cockroaches in my place.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.087
Cockroaches?
I'll kill them for you right away.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.672
No, that's not what I meant.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.133
Their rate of reproduction is no joke.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.345
If you let them be,
they could conquer the world.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.806
-I meant Hye-jin and Chief Hong.
-Sorry?

34:59.889 --> 35:03.351
I left the house because I couldn't
stand their displays of affection.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.686
I see.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.942
Then where are you headed?

35:12.652 --> 35:14.529
To the rotisserie chicken truck.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.198
I saw it on my way home from work.

35:17.281 --> 35:21.410
Then let me escort you there.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.289
-Shall we?
-Sure.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.752
Watch your step.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.172
It's a little uncomfortable here.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.758
Why don't we just go to your place?

35:36.425 --> 35:39.053
Actually, I have to go now.
There's an after-party.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.390
I see. Will Seong-hyeon be there too?

35:42.473 --> 35:43.349
Of course.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.351
How is he doing?

35:47.019 --> 35:49.105
What? Why do you ask?

35:49.188 --> 35:53.484
I ran into him the other day,
and he seemed gaunt.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.027
Did you see him? When?

35:55.111 --> 35:58.406
I met him briefly
on my way to work the other day.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.365
I see.

36:00.199 --> 36:04.328
He told me not to skip meals
with his usual smile,

36:04.412 --> 36:07.707
but he looked quite drawn, and I felt bad.

36:07.790 --> 36:08.916
I didn't notice.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.335
No, he definitely looked gaunt.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.673
Look out for Seong-hyeon
when you see him today.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.092
If you order fried chicken,
give him a drumstick.

36:19.552 --> 36:22.263
What about me then?
Should I nibble on the neck?

36:22.930 --> 36:26.017
Gosh. I didn't mean it like that.
I really didn't.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.852
-I--
-Forget it.

36:27.935 --> 36:31.772
Why not look out for him yourself?
Why ask me to do it for you?

36:31.856 --> 36:33.232
Give him both drumsticks.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.235
Actually, debone them for him
while you're at it.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.696
-Are you upset?
-Why would I be?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.535
I'm just making a reasonable suggestion.

36:44.619 --> 36:48.080
You're worrying about another man
in front of your boyfriend,

36:48.164 --> 36:50.917
so you should just tend to him yourself.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.127
Honestly, I'm fine with it.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.964
That's not what I meant.
It's not what I meant at all.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.133
-Whatever. I'll be off.
-Wait, Chief Hong!

37:01.260 --> 37:03.346
That's not what…

37:08.976 --> 37:10.394
What did I do wrong?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.689
I only meant…

37:19.946 --> 37:23.199
You'll have to wait five minutes
for them to be cooked perfectly.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.327
Yes, that's fine. I'll wait.
I'll be taking two.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.370
-Two?
-Yes.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.038
Got it.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.251
Eun-cheol, one's for you.
You can take it home.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.585
No, I'm good.

37:35.169 --> 37:38.047
Please take it
since we share a fond memory over it.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.133
We do?

37:42.468 --> 37:45.888
-How come?
-It's the first gift you ever got me.

37:45.972 --> 37:50.393
Yes, but I bought it with the 5,000 won
I won with the lottery ticket you gave me.

37:50.476 --> 37:56.482
Exactly. So what do you think
my buying one for you now means?

37:57.066 --> 37:57.942
Well…

38:01.153 --> 38:02.280
I have no idea.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.448
How dense can he be?

38:04.532 --> 38:07.827
You're frustrated too, aren't you?
He's so dense.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.538
"It's not that I don't like you.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.292
I just want to get to know you slowly."

38:14.375 --> 38:17.169
I didn't want to forget it,
so I even memorized it.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.132
So you made out what I said that day?

38:21.716 --> 38:22.925
Of course.

38:23.718 --> 38:27.179
How can you give up
just because I played hard to get?

38:27.263 --> 38:29.974
I never gave up! At times I can be…

38:31.976 --> 38:32.893
a bit slow.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.647
I'm not very smart,

38:36.731 --> 38:39.859
so I studied 15 hours a day for 5 years
to become a cop.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.486
I'm bad at sprinting,

38:42.570 --> 38:44.864
but I've completed six marathons.

38:44.947 --> 38:49.577
When it comes to tenacity,
I know I can come out on top.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.372
I'm saying I never gave up.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.004
Gosh, you can be so frustrating.

39:00.713 --> 39:04.467
This is exactly why
I never date nice guys.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.136
It'll be so frustrating to date you.
Don't you think?

39:09.430 --> 39:10.348
I'm sorry.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.392
I'm really sorry.

39:14.101 --> 39:17.021
Seriously? The frustration will kill me.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.691
-Why don't you get what she's saying?
-Sorry?

39:20.775 --> 39:23.903
She isn't rejecting you.
That was a sign of approval.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.947
That's a yes for the chicken.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.368
And another yes to being a couple.

39:33.037 --> 39:36.374
Thank you. For a number of things.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.167
You can keep the change.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.379
She's the sweetest and you're the densest.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.256
Let's have our chicken at the seawall.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.300
What? Then…

39:49.804 --> 39:51.472
Are we…

39:52.390 --> 39:54.767
Must I also be the one to ask you out?

39:54.850 --> 39:56.352
No. Mi-seon!

39:58.020 --> 40:00.564
Please go steady with me.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.110
There's no need to make
such a grand gesture.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.861
-Stand up already.
-Thank you.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.823
I'll really be good to you.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.117
I get it, so stand up. Now.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.536
-Come on. People are looking.
-Of course.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.830
Let me carry this.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.124
Shall we?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.878
-Thank you, sir.
-Have a good time.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.547
Adore one another.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.173
We'll…

40:27.258 --> 40:28.551
Those are the good times.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.596
Why am I suddenly jealous of them?

40:34.306 --> 40:35.933
You all did great today.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.519
-Likewise!
-Likewise!

40:38.602 --> 40:40.813
Once again, thank you so much, everyone.

40:40.896 --> 40:44.024
Especially you, Yun-gyeong.
When is the baby due?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.943
Next month.

40:46.026 --> 40:49.530
I'm actually worried though.
Our baby is almost ready to come out,

40:49.613 --> 40:52.241
but my OB-GYN closed down.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.911
-Then what shall you do?
-Chung-ho OB-GYN shut down?

40:55.995 --> 40:58.205
That's where I gave birth to I-jun.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.834
There are not many young people here
who want to have a baby,

41:01.917 --> 41:03.919
so a dermatology clinic will open instead.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.421
-I see.
-What will you do then?

41:05.504 --> 41:07.465
I'll have to go to one far away.

41:07.548 --> 41:12.011
A clinic that has a birthing center
is an hour and a half away by car.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.637
That sounds exhausting.

41:13.721 --> 41:14.680
Hardly.

41:14.763 --> 41:18.058
She won't be doing anything.
I'll be the one driving her there.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.019
You…

41:20.811 --> 41:24.982
Having done it myself, I can say for sure
that being on a TV show is not a joke.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.526
Exactly. I found it too stressful.

41:27.610 --> 41:31.238
So why did you want to appear on it
when you couldn't do squat?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.657
"Squat"? Seriously?

41:33.741 --> 41:37.536
Why do you have to say things
in the roughest of ways?

41:37.620 --> 41:40.539
Guys, that's enough.
Why do you always bicker like this?

41:40.623 --> 41:43.626
I'll let you have the stage,
so have at it today.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.587
Goodness. That's rich coming from someone

41:46.670 --> 41:50.090
who stuttered like a broken cassette tape
when given the chance

41:50.174 --> 41:52.468
in front of a camera.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.969
Is it me you meant?

41:55.137 --> 41:57.806
Watch what you say, damn it!

41:57.890 --> 41:59.850
Keep your hands to yourself!

41:59.934 --> 42:02.102
-Jeez.
-When will you stop smacking people?

42:02.186 --> 42:06.774
-What else can I do when--
-Stop it, you two. Enough!

42:06.857 --> 42:09.860
-I can't sit next to her.
-Stop bickering, will you?

42:09.944 --> 42:12.863
Instead, enjoy this symbol of peace,
freshly-fried pigeon.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.283
-What?
-I'm kidding.

42:18.827 --> 42:19.828
A pigeon.

42:21.121 --> 42:24.375
I mean, enjoy the chicken that is similar

42:24.458 --> 42:27.211
-and continue chatting.
-Sure.

42:28.629 --> 42:33.008
This drumstick will go to Director Ji
who had the hardest job today.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.426
Gosh, thank you.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.428
Here's the drumstick
I've been looking for.

42:37.429 --> 42:41.183
-Du-sik must've starved all day.
-He had a tough job too.

42:41.267 --> 42:42.434
-Right.
-Eat up.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.813
Thankfully, a chicken
always has two drumsticks.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.607
Here you go.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.359
-Thank you.
-That's the one I wanted.

42:50.442 --> 42:52.486
Hey! What's up with you today?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.071
Damn jerk!

42:54.154 --> 42:55.197
Spit it out.

42:55.281 --> 42:58.200
It's all right.
I prefer chicken breasts anyway.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.453
-Chicken breasts? Let me see.
-Yes.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.664
-Here you go.
-Right. Thank you very much.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.208
Why not fry a bigger chicken next time?

43:06.292 --> 43:08.168
My piece was over in two bites.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.795
It's tiny, right?

43:09.878 --> 43:11.088
Smaller ones are cheaper.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.573
Give me one too.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.334
He seems to be eating well enough.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.085
Hand me some more.

43:50.169 --> 43:53.422
But you only asked for one.
Here. Take the whole bag.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.135
Chief Hong,

43:59.261 --> 44:01.013
are you upset with me?

44:01.096 --> 44:02.806
Upset? Of course not.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.933
You clearly are.

44:05.517 --> 44:06.727
What is it?

44:07.561 --> 44:09.980
Level with me
and say whatever's bothering you.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.109
Hye-jin's worried about you.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.655
She said that you looked gaunt
and should eat well.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.032
-That's why you're sulking.
-No, I'm not.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.241
Sulking, my foot.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.118
You lucky jerk.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.953
Damn, you're lucky.

44:25.621 --> 44:28.999
I'd like to be jealous
rather than be pitied.

44:29.083 --> 44:31.293
It sure would be nice to yell at her

44:31.377 --> 44:34.588
for being concerned about another man
in my presence.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.843
Do you get it now?

44:40.594 --> 44:42.596
Do you see how lucky you are?

44:43.972 --> 44:47.976
By the way, did you send her parents
tickets to <i>Gag Big League</i>?

44:48.060 --> 44:49.395
I forgot about that.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.689
-Get on it.
-I will.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.023
And put on some weight…

44:54.441 --> 44:56.235
so that my girlfriend doesn't worry.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.071
I'm glad she still thinks of me though.

44:59.154 --> 45:00.406
Do you have a death wish?

45:00.489 --> 45:02.157
-I'm only saying--
-Hey, Ms. Wang.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.451
-I wanted some fresh air.
-I see.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.871
Why are you sitting like that?
You have a bad back.

45:07.955 --> 45:08.914
What's it to you?

45:08.997 --> 45:10.541
Let me get a chair for you.

45:10.624 --> 45:13.127
Forget it. Since when
did you look out for me?

45:13.210 --> 45:16.171
What are you talking about?
I always looked out for you.

45:16.255 --> 45:20.467
Our show will come to a halt if you
fall ill, so of course I should serve you.

45:23.137 --> 45:26.265
Hey. What brings you out?

45:26.849 --> 45:27.766
They're arguing.

45:27.850 --> 45:30.853
Actually, they're not.
They're just talking loudly.

45:32.771 --> 45:36.233
You don't even have
the slightest respect for me.

45:36.316 --> 45:40.237
How can I respect you
when you do nothing respectable?

45:40.320 --> 45:43.031
-Goodness.
-How can a village chief be this childish?

45:43.115 --> 45:45.826
What the…
What does that have to do with anything?

45:45.909 --> 45:48.120
He's not wrong.
Have some respect for people.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.372
Speaking of which,
you humiliated me earlier.

45:50.456 --> 45:53.125
I'm proud of how I speak, so how dare you?

45:53.208 --> 45:56.503
There's nothing hard for me
because I only sit there while you drive?

45:56.587 --> 45:58.755
Do you know how hard it is to be pregnant?

45:58.839 --> 45:59.923
Just eat this, damn it!

46:00.007 --> 46:01.675
I'm sorry. I must've lost my mind.

46:01.758 --> 46:04.094
-You have no right.
-Close up for me, will you?

46:04.178 --> 46:06.138
-I'm heading home.
-Good night.

46:06.221 --> 46:07.848
-Whatever!
-Watch your words!

46:14.062 --> 46:17.316
Would it be rude to just leave?

46:17.399 --> 46:19.193
Absolutely. But I'm leaving.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.903
Seriously? You can't--

46:20.986 --> 46:22.613
I'll get going. Good night.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.370
You and Officer Choi are dating now?

46:31.663 --> 46:32.956
Well…

46:34.041 --> 46:37.461
I'll have to teach him
everything starting with the basics,

46:37.544 --> 46:38.462
but he's adorable.

46:38.545 --> 46:40.881
It's new to me and it might be fun.

46:40.964 --> 46:44.343
My gosh! I just got goose bumps.

46:44.426 --> 46:47.513
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you two!

46:47.596 --> 46:51.683
You know what?
We'll be able to go on double dates now.

46:52.351 --> 46:55.354
Since Chief Hong
and Eun-cheol are quite close,

46:55.437 --> 46:57.481
let's set one up soon.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.983
-A double date?
-How about a camping trip?

47:00.067 --> 47:01.902
-Sure. That sounds good.
-Right?

47:01.985 --> 47:03.111
We'll go car-camping.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.113
CHIEF HONG

47:05.197 --> 47:07.199
But how will we do it?

47:07.282 --> 47:09.576
<i>Come out if you're not in bed.
I'm out front.</i>

47:09.660 --> 47:10.869
Just a minute.

47:11.995 --> 47:12.996
Where are you going?

47:22.130 --> 47:23.924
Why are you back here?

47:25.425 --> 47:26.301
Come sit here.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.637
Who are you to order me around?

47:34.059 --> 47:35.310
I'm sorry.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.021
About what?

47:39.982 --> 47:41.900
I nitpicked when knowing what you meant,

47:41.984 --> 47:44.736
sulked and acted out
after jealousy swept over me,

47:44.820 --> 47:47.197
and slammed the door on my way out.

47:47.698 --> 47:48.824
And it took…

47:50.158 --> 47:51.368
so long to apologize.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.082
Talk about a detailed apology.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.670
Why were you like that though?
It wasn't like you at all.

48:01.753 --> 48:05.549
I have no idea.
I thought things wouldn't get to me,

48:05.632 --> 48:08.051
but I'm more childish
than I believed I was.

48:08.135 --> 48:10.971
I even ate his drumsticks.

48:11.638 --> 48:13.348
-Really?
-Yes.

48:14.474 --> 48:15.559
I'm so pathetic.

48:15.642 --> 48:19.479
Because of you, I've been discovering
a new side of me every day.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.023
Same here.

48:21.106 --> 48:25.068
I've been discovering
a new charming side of you every day.

48:26.236 --> 48:27.487
Today, I found out…

48:29.197 --> 48:30.240
how cute you are.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.743
You're so adorable.

48:32.826 --> 48:36.204
What do you mean I'm adorable?
Don't be silly.

48:36.288 --> 48:37.205
Am I that cute?

48:37.289 --> 48:38.582
It's a mosquito.

48:39.249 --> 48:40.667
There was nothing there.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.502
-You're adorable.
-Am I?

48:42.586 --> 48:43.754
Absolutely adorable.

48:44.546 --> 48:47.466
-Are you accepting my apology then?
-I don't know.

48:47.549 --> 48:50.719
But you said I'm cute.
Again, I'm really sorry.

48:53.055 --> 48:56.308
-Chief Hong!
-Don't run. I'll come to you instead.

49:00.479 --> 49:03.273
I was too excited not to skip over.

49:04.733 --> 49:05.609
How do I look?

49:05.692 --> 49:08.737
Stunning. You're the only one
I see from 100m away.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.365
-I'm dressed in pink.
-Pink?

49:11.448 --> 49:13.325
You look pretty.

49:13.408 --> 49:14.785
-Do I?
-Yes.

49:17.454 --> 49:18.872
-You should drive.
-Me?

49:18.955 --> 49:21.625
-Yes.
-But you don't let others drive.

49:21.708 --> 49:25.379
It's not a new car anymore
since I've driven it around.

49:25.462 --> 49:28.256
Besides, you're not just an "other" now.

49:29.174 --> 49:30.258
Okay, I'll drive.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.429
I was going to get the door for you.

49:34.513 --> 49:37.766
I don't have the patience
to wait for others to get the door.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.185
Got it. Watch your hands.

49:45.524 --> 49:48.443
All right. I see
you already fastened your seat belt.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.612
Let's go then.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.080
Are you that happy?

50:00.163 --> 50:04.418
Yes. I love that we're
going on a drive outside the city

50:04.501 --> 50:06.545
and also your company.
I'm loving everything.

50:06.628 --> 50:09.256
What from your bucket list
will we be doing today?

50:09.339 --> 50:12.467
We need to make a stop
on our way to Seoul.

50:12.551 --> 50:13.969
Okay, got it.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.188
How is a gallery this pretty?

50:25.272 --> 50:26.398
Tell me about it.

50:27.899 --> 50:29.276
Did you know about this place?

50:31.403 --> 50:33.029
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

50:33.113 --> 50:35.198
Yes, it's nice and unique.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.909
I didn't know you were into art.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.453
Actually, I'm not.

50:39.953 --> 50:42.456
Then why is going to a gallery
on your bucket list?

50:42.539 --> 50:43.415
Because it's fancy.

50:44.416 --> 50:45.375
What?

50:45.459 --> 50:50.046
Appreciating artwork with my boyfriend
at a gallery.

50:50.130 --> 50:51.298
How cool is that?

50:52.924 --> 50:54.009
It sure is.

51:01.683 --> 51:05.061
Rather than detailed paintings,
I like simple ones like this.

51:06.229 --> 51:08.398
Adding elaborate details is easy.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.860
It's harder to express the essence
of something with ordinary drawings.

51:12.444 --> 51:13.820
That's so cool.

51:14.446 --> 51:16.448
You must know a lot about art.

51:16.531 --> 51:18.950
No, not a lot.
But the field does intrigue me.

51:19.034 --> 51:21.369
I took an art history class in college.

51:21.870 --> 51:22.871
Art history?

51:23.914 --> 51:27.167
What for? Did you have a girlfriend
who studied art?

51:33.215 --> 51:34.800
Gosh, check this out.

51:34.883 --> 51:36.885
Can't you feel the artist's soul?

51:36.968 --> 51:39.763
-I--
-Don't change the subject like that.

51:39.846 --> 51:42.557
So you did date an art student.

51:42.641 --> 51:43.934
Are you sad right now?

51:44.976 --> 51:46.978
Well, there's something about this piece.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.399
Was she older than you? Or younger?

51:51.483 --> 51:52.818
-The same age?
-Same--

51:53.318 --> 51:55.779
Wait, that's east, isn't it?

51:55.862 --> 51:59.783
Let's check out this one next.
It's titled "Family."

51:59.866 --> 52:01.243
We already saw that one.

52:02.410 --> 52:03.578
So you were the same age.

52:04.246 --> 52:05.956
-I love this gallery.
-Was she pretty?

52:06.039 --> 52:09.668
-There's a sense of naturalism.
-Does the art remind you of her? Does it?

52:09.751 --> 52:13.213
-I doubt the relationship was deep.
-Naturalism is what I prefer…

52:20.679 --> 52:22.305
I've been let loose.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.224
Don't try to stop me.

52:24.307 --> 52:27.561
That's too bad. If we were
at a racing track, I would've bet on you.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.064
Giddy-up! Get going.

52:31.773 --> 52:32.774
Giddy-up!

52:38.488 --> 52:40.740
Hang on. Are you sure
we're in the right place?

52:40.824 --> 52:43.618
Yes, this is where
I'm taking control over.

52:44.661 --> 52:48.290
From head to toe, I'll be
transforming you into my style.

52:48.373 --> 52:50.333
No way. I really don't want this.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.752
-We should leave.
-Don't you think it'll be fun?

52:52.836 --> 52:56.590
No, not in a million years.
I hate this stuff. I'm going downstairs..

52:57.132 --> 52:59.718
But it's on my bucket list.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.145
Darn it…

53:10.228 --> 53:12.188
Good boy.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.942
I really don't need new clothes.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.944
Just do this for me.

53:18.028 --> 53:21.489
-Just try on a total of ten outfits.
-Ten?

53:22.073 --> 53:25.368
Are you telling me
to put on an outfit and show it to you

53:25.452 --> 53:26.703
ten times over?

53:26.786 --> 53:27.662
Yes.

53:29.831 --> 53:33.251
Hye-jin, look. I feel so nauseated
that I might puke.

53:33.335 --> 53:36.630
The restroom's that way,
and the fitting room is this way.

53:36.713 --> 53:38.882
I'm not Julia Roberts from <i>Pretty Woman</i>.

53:39.382 --> 53:42.636
That movie was released in 1990.
This is such a cliché.

53:42.719 --> 53:45.472
This type of cliché
is known as classic these days.

53:46.473 --> 53:49.684
By the way, I didn't realize
you liked romantic comedies.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.228
You're super annoying.

53:52.312 --> 53:53.730
How adorable.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.899
I'm Richard Gere today!

53:59.527 --> 54:00.737
This looks good too.

54:01.363 --> 54:02.447
Hold on.

54:04.699 --> 54:06.034
How do I look?

54:06.117 --> 54:07.869
-You look great.
-I like it too.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.746
-Let's take this.
-Try on the navy one.

54:09.829 --> 54:10.872
-We'll take this.
-No.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.958
Try on the navy one. It's nice too.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.629
Who made you Michael Jackson?

54:18.755 --> 54:20.465
You look sexy!

54:20.548 --> 54:22.217
-So this is the one.
-No.

54:22.300 --> 54:24.219
-The gray one.
-This seems fine to me.

54:24.302 --> 54:26.638
No, you look too much like Michael Jackson

54:26.721 --> 54:28.348
which can be a problem.

54:29.307 --> 54:30.767
-I think it's nice.
-Go on.

54:34.020 --> 54:35.105
Looking dandy!

54:35.188 --> 54:37.107
This one's too hot for the weather though.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.361
-Sorry.
-Why are you stripping me?

54:41.444 --> 54:43.279
This one's a no. It's too revealing.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.823
Next! That one's a no.

54:44.906 --> 54:46.408
-This…
-Wait,

54:46.491 --> 54:48.535
-is it see-through?
-Well, this…

54:49.035 --> 54:50.328
Unbelievable, right?

54:50.412 --> 54:52.038
I don't think this is the one.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.249
-It's just wrong.
-It's absurd.

54:59.295 --> 55:02.215
This one's nice. I'm loving the colors.

55:02.298 --> 55:04.968
-I can't do this anymore.
-You look so good.

55:05.051 --> 55:06.970
-Let's stop.
-You'll wrinkle the pants.

55:07.053 --> 55:09.097
Okay, fine.
Let's go with the first outfit.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.640
-Try it on once more.
-The first?

55:10.724 --> 55:12.017
The gingham suit.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.811
-Why don't we just take that one?
-No, try it on first.

55:14.894 --> 55:16.771
-That's not necessary.
-The waist was big.

55:16.855 --> 55:17.939
No, it fit perfectly.

55:18.023 --> 55:19.691
Okay, just try it on once again.

55:19.774 --> 55:21.151
I don't think--

55:23.069 --> 55:24.070
Should I dress you?

55:25.405 --> 55:26.990
-Here you go.
-Right.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.324
I'll pay with this.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.993
No way. I'm buying it myself.

55:30.076 --> 55:31.369
Don't be ridiculous.

55:31.453 --> 55:34.497
Buying clothes for my boyfriend
is included on my bucket list.

55:34.581 --> 55:38.209
Besides, it's your birthday soon.

55:39.210 --> 55:41.296
Consider it an early birthday gift.

55:41.379 --> 55:43.006
Right, my birthday's coming up.

55:43.798 --> 55:45.216
Okay, I'll gladly accept it.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.259
Sure.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.845
-She's a cool girlfriend.
-Right.

55:50.555 --> 55:51.848
So where to next?

55:51.931 --> 55:54.184
-To eat something delicious.
-Something delicious?

55:54.267 --> 55:56.311
Wait. I need to stop by somewhere.

55:56.936 --> 55:58.021
-Stop by?
-Yes.

56:07.113 --> 56:09.407
-Could I take a look at that?
-Of course.

56:14.079 --> 56:15.330
Let me hold that for you.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.626
What do you think?

56:20.126 --> 56:22.337
It's pretty. It looks great on you.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.671
-Does it?
-Yes.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.965
-I'll take this then.
-Sure.

56:26.049 --> 56:28.593
-I'll check if we have a new one in stock.
-Sure.

56:29.094 --> 56:31.638
I've been eyeing it
for quite some time, you see.

56:31.721 --> 56:32.972
Do you like it that much?

56:33.056 --> 56:35.850
Yes, I love everything in this world
that is beautiful.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.478
-Then let me--
-There was a new one in stock.

56:38.561 --> 56:39.437
Really?

56:39.521 --> 56:42.023
That would be 5.55 million won.

56:42.107 --> 56:43.775
How would you like to pay?

56:43.858 --> 56:45.944
-With this credit card.
-Sure.

56:46.027 --> 56:48.154
-I'll pay in full.
-Yes, ma'am.

56:50.448 --> 56:51.491
I finally got it!

56:52.075 --> 56:54.285
So it must be a real diamond.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.122
Of course it is. I don't wear fakes.

56:57.705 --> 57:01.584
Why isn't I-jun picking up?
Maybe he's at the restaurant.

57:02.877 --> 57:04.546
I hope it wasn't salty.

57:04.629 --> 57:05.964
I think it was to his taste.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.842
I'm sorry for not returning this sooner.

57:08.925 --> 57:09.926
What the hell?

57:10.885 --> 57:12.262
What is he doing here?

57:12.762 --> 57:13.763
That insulated bottle.

57:16.683 --> 57:17.642
Have some of this.

57:19.477 --> 57:21.396
You didn't have to bring it back.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.983
-I'll get going then.
-Sure thing.

57:25.066 --> 57:26.025
-Bye.
-Bye.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.364
Oh, my God!

57:32.365 --> 57:33.658
Mr. Chang.

57:43.001 --> 57:44.669
So you're saying

57:45.253 --> 57:47.338
that the hangover soup was from Hwa-jeong?

57:47.422 --> 57:50.717
That's right. She dropped it off
after hearing about

57:51.551 --> 57:52.677
your nasty hangover.

57:53.428 --> 57:55.805
What is she playing at?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.349
She may speak harshly to you,

57:58.933 --> 58:00.435
but she cares a lot about you.

58:00.518 --> 58:03.271
As if. She doesn't care about me at all.

58:03.354 --> 58:04.647
I bet she gave me leftovers.

58:04.731 --> 58:07.150
No, that's not the case!

58:08.860 --> 58:10.320
You're so clueless.

58:10.820 --> 58:14.741
What now? Is there
something else I don't know?

58:15.700 --> 58:16.993
You see…

58:17.076 --> 58:18.036
What is it?

58:18.828 --> 58:20.914
Let's go have something nice to eat.

58:25.460 --> 58:26.503
Hong Du-sik?

58:33.551 --> 58:34.677
Tae-gyeong?

58:34.761 --> 58:38.181
It really is you.
Jeez, how long has it been?

58:39.724 --> 58:41.726
I know. It's been a while.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.771
I didn't realize you had company. Hello.

58:44.854 --> 58:46.105
Yes, hello.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.816
Hey. Do you know how worried I was?

58:48.900 --> 58:51.694
You suddenly vanished off
the face of the earth.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.029
Where do you live now?

58:53.112 --> 58:54.614
I moved back to my hometown.

58:54.697 --> 58:56.241
I see.

58:56.991 --> 58:58.535
I'm working at a new place now.

58:59.494 --> 59:03.706
Here's my business card.
Call me when it's convenient for you.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.917
I'm afraid I got to run now. I'm sorry.

59:06.501 --> 59:07.460
-Well, then.
-Bye.

59:08.419 --> 59:09.420
Call me.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.215
Who is he?

59:13.758 --> 59:16.302
We went to college together.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.805
I see. Were you in the same major?

59:18.888 --> 59:19.931
Let's go eat.

59:21.474 --> 59:25.770
Chief Hong, we ticked a lot of boxes
off my bucket list today.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.731
We'll do all hundred of them in no time.

59:29.524 --> 59:31.401
Don't worry though.

59:31.484 --> 59:34.571
I can come up with 200, 300,
and even 1,000 more.

59:34.654 --> 59:37.198
There are so many things
that I wish to do with you.

59:40.326 --> 59:42.036
Are you listening to me, Chief Hong?

59:44.622 --> 59:45.623
Chief Hong.

59:47.041 --> 59:47.875
Hey!

59:49.377 --> 59:51.337
Sorry. What did you say?

59:53.423 --> 59:56.509
It's nothing. Just enjoy your meal.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.012
Right.

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:11.649
Actually…
I really shouldn't tell you this.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.568
It's all right. Go ahead.

1:00:13.651 --> 1:00:15.445
The tonic that's good for your joints

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:17.864
was also from Ms. Yeo.

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:19.032
What?

1:00:19.115 --> 1:00:21.075
She was adamant about making it seem

1:00:21.909 --> 1:00:22.994
like it was from me.

1:00:26.456 --> 1:00:28.750
What's gotten into her?

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:32.086
Jeez, Yeong-guk.
This isn't like you at all.

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:33.630
You never drink alone.

1:00:33.713 --> 1:00:36.132
You know, I just…

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:39.427
I had to get out of the house.
It's depressing to be alone.

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:41.137
Would you care for one?

1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:44.724
No, I need to run this place,
but there are no customers!

1:00:44.807 --> 1:00:45.892
Let me get my beer.

1:00:46.726 --> 1:00:48.019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:00:55.526 --> 1:00:57.153
Nothing beats draft beer in summer.

1:00:57.236 --> 1:00:59.989
Damn, that's sweet.

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:03.910
I'm sure beer tastes
like honey to you now.

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:04.869
What?

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.496
Thanks to I-jun.

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:09.957
I heard he won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:13.294
Gosh, it's not a big deal.
He's the runner-up of Gangwon Province.

1:01:13.378 --> 1:01:14.545
My Ju-ri…

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.174
has been running parallel
to her academics.

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:22.178
It's okay though. Don't worry about it.

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:24.597
As you know, my Ju-ri is so pretty.

1:01:24.681 --> 1:01:26.557
Of course.

1:01:26.641 --> 1:01:28.685
-Her eyes are almond-shaped.
-Exactly.

1:01:28.768 --> 1:01:31.354
And don't forget her chubby cheeks.

1:01:31.437 --> 1:01:34.649
She looks just like her mom, right?

1:01:34.732 --> 1:01:36.943
She looks more like her as she grows up.

1:01:37.026 --> 1:01:37.944
I know.

1:01:40.613 --> 1:01:43.491
These days, looking at her

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:47.662
makes me miss So-yeon even more.

1:01:48.454 --> 1:01:53.042
Let me ask. Do you still miss your wife?

1:01:53.126 --> 1:01:54.210
Of course.

1:01:56.129 --> 1:02:01.092
After I'm done raising Ju-ri, I'll be
waiting for the day I meet her again.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.889
Come on. Stop lying.

1:02:06.973 --> 1:02:09.642
Your marriage was such a long time ago.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:12.645
Actually, it's already been a long time
since she passed away.

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:14.689
How can you still miss her?

1:02:14.772 --> 1:02:17.066
Why do you keep asking me
the same question?

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:18.943
What? When did I ask you that?

1:02:19.026 --> 1:02:23.239
You asked me a few years back.

1:02:23.322 --> 1:02:25.158
We were having drinks.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:30.496
Liar. What a liar.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:35.042
Your marriage was such a long time ago.

1:02:35.877 --> 1:02:38.838
I mean, it's already been a long time
since she passed away.

1:02:38.921 --> 1:02:43.885
How can you still miss her
and love her the same way you did?

1:02:44.469 --> 1:02:46.471
That's hard to believe.

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:48.848
It's true, you prick!

1:02:48.931 --> 1:02:50.016
Whatever.

1:02:50.516 --> 1:02:52.518
You know,

1:02:53.519 --> 1:02:58.274
I still remember the moment

1:02:58.357 --> 1:03:01.360
we walked down the aisle together.

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:02.653
I…

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:08.409
promised her my eternal love.

1:03:09.827 --> 1:03:13.039
Love, my ass.

1:03:13.581 --> 1:03:18.461
Marriage is all about
staying together out of attachment.

1:03:18.544 --> 1:03:22.089
That's how it was for me
from the start, you know.

1:03:22.673 --> 1:03:26.010
I needed to get married
before it was too late,

1:03:27.678 --> 1:03:30.306
but my first love had moved away.

1:03:32.558 --> 1:03:33.559
I ended up

1:03:34.685 --> 1:03:37.230
with the woman I was friends with.

1:03:37.313 --> 1:03:41.108
That's how marriage is for most people.

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:43.194
My mother-in-law…

1:03:43.277 --> 1:03:46.739
I mean, Hwa-jeong's mother
had passed away around that time.

1:03:50.201 --> 1:03:55.289
I felt bad that she was all alone,
and that's how…

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:56.999
I miss So-yeon so much.

1:04:01.587 --> 1:04:04.799
-Damn it.
-Don't you cry.

1:04:04.882 --> 1:04:09.679
All I'm saying is
that there's not much to marriage.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.808
There's nothing special about it.

1:04:13.891 --> 1:04:17.687
It doesn't have some grand meaning.

1:04:17.770 --> 1:04:18.813
It's…

1:04:21.774 --> 1:04:24.610
It's just boring.

1:04:29.115 --> 1:04:30.283
<i>That night,</i>

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:34.704
<i>we were so wasted
that I barely remember anything.</i>

1:04:34.787 --> 1:04:36.205
Wait.

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:40.668
I do remember
how Ms. Yeo dragged you home.

1:04:40.751 --> 1:04:44.005
Wait. Did Hwa-jeong come here then?

1:04:44.088 --> 1:04:45.631
Yes.

1:04:45.715 --> 1:04:50.553
It suddenly started to pour,
so she came by with an umbrella.

1:04:50.636 --> 1:04:51.721
It was weird though.

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:57.560
Hwa-jeong… I mean, Ms. Yeo
had an umbrella in her hand,

1:04:58.352 --> 1:05:00.980
but she was soaked from head to toe
for some reason.

1:05:02.481 --> 1:05:04.817
Maybe I'm remembering it wrong.

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:07.486
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1:05:46.651 --> 1:05:49.403
Jeez. What time did I get in last night?

1:05:49.487 --> 1:05:54.116
Just how much did I have to drink?
I completely blacked out.

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:57.244
Hey, you made dried pollack soup.

1:05:59.455 --> 1:06:03.751
Nothing cures a hangover
better than my wife's soup.

1:06:03.834 --> 1:06:06.128
Honey, you're the best.

1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:08.839
Jeez.

1:06:26.065 --> 1:06:26.899
What the hell?

1:06:28.776 --> 1:06:29.819
Are you insane?

1:06:29.902 --> 1:06:32.488
I told you not to
take off your socks inside-out.

1:06:33.322 --> 1:06:34.323
Socks?

1:06:35.449 --> 1:06:39.078
Are you insane?
You did this over some stupid socks?

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:41.622
I've told you numerous times.

1:06:41.706 --> 1:06:45.042
I clearly told you
not to take them off inside-out.

1:06:45.126 --> 1:06:48.087
And not to throw them
everywhere around the house.

1:06:48.170 --> 1:06:51.882
How many times must I tell you this?

1:06:52.466 --> 1:06:54.301
I'm not your maid, you know.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:57.722
Is that so hard to do?

1:06:57.805 --> 1:07:01.142
This is how one wears their socks, right?

1:07:02.184 --> 1:07:05.354
So how hard is it to take them off
and put them in the hamper?

1:07:05.438 --> 1:07:08.566
Don't take them off inside-out, damn it!

1:07:08.649 --> 1:07:10.609
Don't throw them around the house!

1:07:11.277 --> 1:07:14.905
Don't take off your socks inside-out

1:07:14.989 --> 1:07:18.701
and don't throw them around the house.
Got it?

1:07:20.536 --> 1:07:22.121
Just don't!

1:07:30.087 --> 1:07:31.714
I'm such a jerk.

1:07:37.428 --> 1:07:38.804
I'm such an idiot.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:44.393
It was all my fault.

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:47.897
I was to blame.

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.079
Would you like to come in?

1:08:03.162 --> 1:08:06.207
What? No, it's already late.

1:08:07.541 --> 1:08:09.877
Right, of course.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.171
You must be tired from all the driving.

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:14.590
-Go and get some rest then.
-Sure.

1:08:15.591 --> 1:08:17.718
-Thank you for the gift.
-Don't mention it.

1:08:17.802 --> 1:08:19.261
-Good night.
-I'll get going.

1:08:19.345 --> 1:08:20.179
Sure.

1:08:44.370 --> 1:08:46.705
I wonder why he became
depressed so suddenly.

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:51.377
Did it seem
like I was showing off my money?

1:08:54.964 --> 1:08:56.590
Was it the necklace?

1:08:57.591 --> 1:08:59.593
Was it a bit too much?

1:09:02.304 --> 1:09:04.056
Why did I buy so much?

1:09:09.562 --> 1:09:13.941
MS. DENTIST

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:18.362
<i>It's only morning, but I miss you already.</i>

1:09:18.445 --> 1:09:20.906
<i>I hear it's scorching hot today.</i>

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:23.909
<i>So drink water often and eat proper meals.</i>

1:09:23.993 --> 1:09:26.954
<i>And if you miss me,
come run over any time.</i>

1:09:31.834 --> 1:09:34.295
<i>-Yes, you too.</i>
-"Yes, you too."

1:09:35.629 --> 1:09:36.964
"Yes, you too"?

1:09:40.926 --> 1:09:42.344
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:47.391
The thing is I sent a text of 46 words,

1:09:47.474 --> 1:09:48.851
and he texted back three.

1:09:49.351 --> 1:09:50.728
What do you think of that?

1:09:50.811 --> 1:09:53.063
What? He must be busy.

1:09:53.147 --> 1:09:56.567
He might be, but I still think
it's too short. Isn't it?

1:09:56.650 --> 1:09:59.069
Maybe I hurt his feelings in some way.

1:10:00.112 --> 1:10:01.989
Why be bothered by it?

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:04.116
It's how Chief Hong usually is.

1:10:04.825 --> 1:10:05.910
You think so?

1:10:07.036 --> 1:10:09.330
Seriously?

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:10.289
What is it?

1:10:10.372 --> 1:10:11.957
-Are you kidding me?
-What's wrong?

1:10:12.041 --> 1:10:17.838
Check it out. I sent a text
with lots of hearts and emoticons,

1:10:17.922 --> 1:10:21.008
but all he wrote is "Good morning."
Seriously…

1:10:21.091 --> 1:10:24.762
Am I in the police? Am I his colleague?
Am I his superior or boss?

1:10:24.845 --> 1:10:27.473
Why is he being so formal?

1:10:27.556 --> 1:10:29.642
That's how Officer Choi usually is.

1:10:30.768 --> 1:10:32.269
It hurts, you know.

1:10:35.147 --> 1:10:36.815
It's so beautiful.

1:10:46.992 --> 1:10:48.202
Chief Hong.

1:10:48.285 --> 1:10:51.580
-<i>Hey, Ms. Dentist. Is something up?</i>
-Must something be up for me to call?

1:10:52.998 --> 1:10:56.293
Chief Hong, how about
we have dinner together later?

1:10:56.377 --> 1:11:00.214
<i>I'm afraid I'm working until late tonight.
Let's have it next time.</i>

1:11:00.297 --> 1:11:02.800
Okay. It can't be helped.

1:11:03.801 --> 1:11:04.802
Sure.

1:11:06.387 --> 1:11:07.638
He hung up.

1:11:12.351 --> 1:11:15.896
I was right.
He's putting distance between us.

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:24.071
Gosh. I'm so relieved
that we got good internal reviews.

1:11:24.154 --> 1:11:26.615
It wasn't just good.
They were eating it up.

1:11:26.699 --> 1:11:29.618
I forbid you
from popping the champagne too early.

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:33.372
Anyway, why isn't our writer here
to enjoy this good news with us?

1:11:35.249 --> 1:11:36.417
Over there.

1:11:37.251 --> 1:11:39.795
Isn't that Director Yang Gyeong-min
from TCB?

1:11:40.629 --> 1:11:42.381
I heard from a friend there

1:11:42.464 --> 1:11:46.260
that he's been trying to get Ms. Wang
on board for his new variety show.

1:11:50.431 --> 1:11:52.474
I'm glad the higher-ups loved it.

1:11:52.975 --> 1:11:54.852
It would've been nicer to have you there.

1:11:56.687 --> 1:12:00.858
You said you were meeting someone.
Was it Director Yang Gyeong-min?

1:12:00.941 --> 1:12:02.109
Yes.

1:12:02.776 --> 1:12:06.530
People can't get enough of you, right?

1:12:07.072 --> 1:12:10.451
Don't tell me he's been
trying to woo you for his show.

1:12:10.534 --> 1:12:13.162
Yes, he spreads his feathers
like a peacock

1:12:13.245 --> 1:12:15.205
and calls for me like a nightingale.

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.166
No way.

1:12:17.249 --> 1:12:18.375
It's true.

1:12:21.712 --> 1:12:23.964
And I'm taking him up on his offer.

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:26.216
What?

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:28.218
This current show will be

1:12:28.886 --> 1:12:30.012
our last.

1:12:31.972 --> 1:12:34.516
-That's out of the blue.
-It actually isn't.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:37.269
It's been seven years.
It's time for a new scene.

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:42.983
At this rate, I'll be stuck in a rut.

1:12:43.067 --> 1:12:44.943
I need to change things up.

1:12:45.027 --> 1:12:47.029
We'll change things up together then.

1:12:47.112 --> 1:12:49.073
Let's try something completely different.

1:12:49.156 --> 1:12:50.574
I've been meaning to, you know.

1:12:50.657 --> 1:12:52.826
No, I'd rather not work with you anymore.

1:12:54.578 --> 1:12:56.080
It should end here.

1:12:56.163 --> 1:12:58.874
If it's because
of the recent stuff I pulled,

1:13:00.292 --> 1:13:01.835
know that it won't happen again.

1:13:03.003 --> 1:13:04.713
I fully admit my wrongdoing.

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:06.048
I'm sorry.

1:13:07.883 --> 1:13:11.512
It's true that I was briefly disappointed
in you, but that's not the reason.

1:13:12.262 --> 1:13:13.639
Then what is it?

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:15.057
It's me.

1:13:18.435 --> 1:13:20.729
So don't try to find
the reason in your actions.

1:13:22.022 --> 1:13:23.023
Seong-hyeon,

1:13:24.566 --> 1:13:28.487
you're a good TV director and,
more importantly, a good person.

1:13:28.570 --> 1:13:31.698
You'll make good shows
with any other writer out there.

1:13:39.915 --> 1:13:40.958
I'll get going then.

1:14:03.147 --> 1:14:05.566
What are you doing here?
Were you waiting for me?

1:14:07.526 --> 1:14:08.861
You really are home late.

1:14:08.944 --> 1:14:10.654
I told you. You should've called.

1:14:14.741 --> 1:14:16.034
-Let's go.
-What?

1:14:17.369 --> 1:14:18.704
Won't you invite me in?

1:14:20.706 --> 1:14:22.249
But I have something to say.

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.168
Then say it outside.

1:14:28.630 --> 1:14:30.257
Where are we going?

1:14:31.967 --> 1:14:34.720
Are we still not there yet?
Where are we going?

1:14:34.803 --> 1:14:36.013
You'll see.

1:14:37.306 --> 1:14:38.640
Where are we headed?

1:14:46.523 --> 1:14:48.233
This is the place.

1:14:53.155 --> 1:14:54.239
What's all this?

1:14:55.574 --> 1:14:57.743
-Did you put this together?
-Yes.

1:14:58.660 --> 1:15:01.872
I only stopped by the house
to get more light bulbs.

1:15:03.123 --> 1:15:05.667
I was going to make it look even better

1:15:06.376 --> 1:15:08.378
and get you later in the night.

1:15:12.508 --> 1:15:14.468
What is it? Don't you like it?

1:15:15.761 --> 1:15:17.304
It's a sigh of relief.

1:15:18.931 --> 1:15:23.352
You seemed upset,
and I thought it was my fault.

1:15:23.435 --> 1:15:24.269
What?

1:15:25.270 --> 1:15:29.358
I thought the necklace I bought
turned you off in some way.

1:15:30.067 --> 1:15:32.736
What? Jeez.

1:15:33.237 --> 1:15:36.156
What on earth goes through
that tiny head of yours?

1:15:37.199 --> 1:15:38.700
You were way off.

1:15:40.619 --> 1:15:41.745
Have a seat.

1:15:45.374 --> 1:15:46.667
-It's cute.
-Isn't it pretty?

1:15:46.750 --> 1:15:49.920
-Yes. My goodness.
-Watch your step.

1:15:56.468 --> 1:15:57.469
Hye-jin.

1:15:58.095 --> 1:15:59.429
Yes?

1:15:59.513 --> 1:16:02.391
You don't have to worry
about how I view your actions.

1:16:03.183 --> 1:16:06.895
You bought yourself a gift
with the money you worked hard to earn,

1:16:07.521 --> 1:16:09.064
so why worry about what I think?

1:16:10.315 --> 1:16:11.984
I'm not fazed at all,

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:15.070
so do whatever it is you want.

1:16:16.613 --> 1:16:17.614
Sorry.

1:16:18.615 --> 1:16:20.867
I guess I jumped to conclusions.

1:16:21.994 --> 1:16:26.373
A part of me thought
that it made you feel inferior.

1:16:27.082 --> 1:16:28.667
I'm very understanding, you know.

1:16:30.335 --> 1:16:31.962
My boyfriend is the best.

1:16:33.005 --> 1:16:36.925
Is that why you're not wearing
your new necklace? Not to bother me?

1:16:37.009 --> 1:16:39.761
Well, I already sold it.

1:16:40.971 --> 1:16:43.599
-What?
-It didn't seem right,

1:16:43.682 --> 1:16:45.309
so I sold it online.

1:16:45.392 --> 1:16:48.812
-I already sent it away.
-So you don't have it anymore?

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:51.273
-No.
-This is bad.

1:16:51.356 --> 1:16:52.899
-Why?
-Because…

1:16:57.529 --> 1:16:58.405
What's this?

1:16:59.906 --> 1:17:01.116
Find out for yourself.

1:17:08.582 --> 1:17:10.292
It's so pretty. My gosh.

1:17:11.168 --> 1:17:13.086
I made it myself.

1:17:13.170 --> 1:17:15.464
-Really?
-Yes.

1:17:16.256 --> 1:17:17.799
It's so pretty.

1:17:17.883 --> 1:17:21.595
I wanted to buy the necklace for you,
but it was too expensive.

1:17:22.262 --> 1:17:25.766
So I made a jewelry box for it instead.

1:17:26.516 --> 1:17:28.435
But now that necklace is gone.

1:17:28.518 --> 1:17:31.730
It's fine. I have many
other necklaces and earrings.

1:17:31.813 --> 1:17:33.649
I'll fill this up in no time.

1:17:35.025 --> 1:17:36.193
Thanks, Chief Hong.

1:17:36.693 --> 1:17:38.403
-It's beautiful.
-Do you like it?

1:17:38.487 --> 1:17:39.655
Yes.

1:17:48.622 --> 1:17:50.499
This place is amazing.

1:17:51.416 --> 1:17:54.336
Right? It's my favorite spot.

1:17:55.128 --> 1:17:57.798
You might say that the sea
looks the same from everywhere--

1:17:57.881 --> 1:18:00.634
No, it's different.

1:18:02.469 --> 1:18:06.973
It becomes a special place
once a memory is made there.

1:18:09.559 --> 1:18:12.312
The sea Chief Hong took me to…

1:18:13.563 --> 1:18:16.817
has now become
one of my favorite spots too.

1:18:19.778 --> 1:18:23.782
You know, I love everything here.

1:18:25.450 --> 1:18:27.202
The bonfire,

1:18:27.786 --> 1:18:29.287
the sound of the waves,

1:18:30.580 --> 1:18:31.832
the sound of the water,

1:18:32.749 --> 1:18:34.292
the scent of summer,

1:18:35.335 --> 1:18:36.253
the stars,

1:18:37.671 --> 1:18:38.755
and you.

1:18:41.091 --> 1:18:44.344
Out of everything
that exists in this world,

1:18:45.095 --> 1:18:46.430
I like you the most.

1:18:48.849 --> 1:18:52.519
In that case, I should be the one
to say this first.

1:18:55.772 --> 1:18:56.857
Yoon Hye-jin,

1:18:58.817 --> 1:19:00.193
I love you.

1:19:03.321 --> 1:19:04.448
Me too.

1:19:05.449 --> 1:19:06.533
Hong Du-sik,

1:19:07.784 --> 1:19:08.994
I love you.

1:20:04.424 --> 1:20:07.093
DU-SIK AND HYE-JIN'S BUCKET LIST

1:20:29.032 --> 1:20:31.535
