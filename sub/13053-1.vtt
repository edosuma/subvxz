01:48.957 --> 01:51.752
I've been born-again my whole life.

01:52.669 --> 01:56.673
Accepting Jesus into your heart
and getting saved is a big decision...

01:57.424 --> 01:59.384
especially for a three-year-old.

02:02.054 --> 02:06.100
My faith taught me that everything
was a part of God's plan.

02:07.059 --> 02:10.645
Mom said that he even had a reason
for taking my father to heaven.

02:11.605 --> 02:15.092
She explained
that Daddy was with the angels.

02:15.192 --> 02:18.654
Well, I wanted to be with the angels, too.

02:21.198 --> 02:23.617
But God had other plans.

02:25.035 --> 02:27.855
Jesus became the center of my life.

02:27.955 --> 02:30.065
I still don't think
he's supposed to be white.

02:30.165 --> 02:33.569
- I was watching this thing on television...
- Of course, he's white.

02:33.669 --> 02:36.405
Gosh. Sometimes I think
my brother's retarded, too.

02:36.505 --> 02:39.199
No, your brother's not retarded.

02:39.299 --> 02:43.412
I was a member in good standing
of the Christian Jewels.

02:43.512 --> 02:45.748
It's sort of like a girl gang for Jesus.

02:45.848 --> 02:47.850
Don't kill your baby!

02:52.229 --> 02:53.255
Lillian Cummings.

02:53.355 --> 02:55.257
My mom was finally named the number one

02:55.357 --> 02:58.969
Christian interior decorator
for the entire region.

02:59.069 --> 03:03.390
And in spite of living
in what the Bible calls "the end times,"

03:03.490 --> 03:05.768
my future was looking bright.

03:05.868 --> 03:08.454
I had the perfect Christian boyfriend.

03:09.371 --> 03:14.126
And I was about to be a senior
at a really good Christian school.

03:37.149 --> 03:39.635
Two weeks before summer vacation ended,

03:39.735 --> 03:41.403
everything changed.

03:44.281 --> 03:46.058
My boyfriend and I played this game

03:46.158 --> 03:48.660
of telling each other secrets underwater.

03:49.411 --> 03:52.022
It's lame, I know.

03:52.122 --> 03:54.692
But this wasn't exactly
the MTV Beach House.

03:54.792 --> 03:57.945
Okay, now my turn.

03:58.045 --> 04:00.130
Okay, ready?

04:29.159 --> 04:30.160
Mary!

04:31.495 --> 04:33.689
Maybe it was because I was drowning,

04:33.789 --> 04:36.458
or the shock of Dean's confession...

04:37.167 --> 04:40.546
but at that moment, I had a vision.

04:47.261 --> 04:48.954
Dean needs you now.

04:49.054 --> 04:51.598
You must do all you can to help him.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.883
It's just a little bump, Mom.
I'm totally fine.

05:00.983 --> 05:02.818
Okay, all right.

05:03.444 --> 05:06.221
Mom was away at the Christian
Community Leader's Convention

05:06.321 --> 05:10.492
in Orlando with Pastor Skip...
the principal of my school.

05:11.201 --> 05:13.479
- Honey?
- Mom.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.231
You didn't tell me
Pastor Skip was so nice.

05:16.331 --> 05:18.359
Yeah, everybody loves him.

05:18.459 --> 05:21.945
We've been talking about setting up
our own fellowship programs

05:22.045 --> 05:23.964
when I get back to Cherry Hill.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.284
- I have to go.
- Come and get it.

05:27.384 --> 05:28.886
Come and get it.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.330
Love you.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.015
- I love you, too.
- Bye.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.435
What's shaking, Skip?

05:49.531 --> 05:52.059
How could my boyfriend be gay?

05:52.159 --> 05:54.687
He's, like, the best Christian I know.

05:54.787 --> 05:58.107
He's an athlete who's
constantly strengthening himself...

05:58.207 --> 06:01.293
physically, creatively,
and spiritually for the Lord.

06:04.088 --> 06:05.547
Thank you, Jesus.

06:07.341 --> 06:12.554
Why had he been stricken
with such a spiritually toxic affliction?

06:16.016 --> 06:20.129
I figured I needed to take
the most direct approach to saving him.

06:20.229 --> 06:22.523
I mean, it was Christ's will and all.

06:23.399 --> 06:26.093
Jesus spoke to you? In person?

06:26.193 --> 06:27.694
He trusts me.

06:28.737 --> 06:31.407
Okay? You're just gonna
have to trust me, too.

06:35.786 --> 06:38.122
- Just kiss me, okay?
- Okay.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.859
Dean and I worked diligently
on his problem

06:41.959 --> 06:43.819
for the rest of the summer.

06:43.919 --> 06:45.546
Anything yet?

06:50.801 --> 06:51.885
Now?

06:55.389 --> 06:57.015
Are you sure this isn't a sin?

06:58.016 --> 07:00.919
I was pretty sure
what we were doing wasn't a sin,

07:01.019 --> 07:04.048
but not sure enough
to give Dean what he really needed.

07:04.148 --> 07:08.694
I needed spiritual guidance
or a sign or something, and quick.

07:13.490 --> 07:17.853
Hilary Faye seemed to have
a spiritual solution for every problem.

07:17.953 --> 07:20.564
Christian girls have got to know
how to protect themselves.

07:20.664 --> 07:25.277
I mean, sure, Jesus could restore
my physical and spiritual virginity,

07:25.377 --> 07:29.198
especially if I lost it
to some rapist, but...

07:29.298 --> 07:30.758
who wants that?

07:31.467 --> 07:36.096
I'm saving myself until marriage,
and I'll use force if necessary.

07:39.475 --> 07:42.252
What's all that about
restoring your virginity?

07:42.352 --> 07:44.338
I mean, physically, you're a virgin once.

07:44.438 --> 07:48.550
Yeah, and it's not about reversing
the violation of your blessed womb.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.320
It's about Jesus
granting you a virginal heart.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.489
That way, you're pure again.

07:54.323 --> 07:55.449
Do it.

07:57.284 --> 07:59.770
My next move was clear.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.330
Nice.

08:02.372 --> 08:03.707
You're getting the hang of it.

08:29.983 --> 08:31.693
How are you doing? What's going on?

08:45.290 --> 08:46.708
What's going on?

09:02.266 --> 09:03.959
Sure, it was a radical step,

09:04.059 --> 09:07.629
but why else had Jesus
directed me to the gun range?

09:07.729 --> 09:09.565
Thank you, Jesus.

09:25.581 --> 09:29.068
Having asked Jesus to restore
my emotional and spiritual virginity

09:29.168 --> 09:31.320
in exchange for curing Dean,

09:31.420 --> 09:34.798
I started my senior year
with all of that behind me.

09:37.092 --> 09:39.636
This new van is amazing.

09:40.262 --> 09:41.555
Thanks.

09:44.099 --> 09:46.168
It's official.

09:46.268 --> 09:48.937
The Christian Jewels...
I bought one for everybody.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.607
Pin it on. I wanna see it.

09:55.736 --> 09:58.055
It's terrific, Hilary Faye. Thank you.

09:58.155 --> 09:59.198
You're welcome.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.645
Hi, Roland. How was your summer?

10:04.745 --> 10:07.189
- What?
- Your summer, how was it?

10:07.289 --> 10:11.485
Well, I went rollerblading,
water-skiing, learned to kickbox.

10:11.585 --> 10:12.903
You know, the usual.

10:13.003 --> 10:16.865
Why do you have to make people feel so
awkward about your differently-abledness?

10:16.965 --> 10:19.284
I'm sorry, I really don't know
what's gotten into him.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.929
Here's the latest from Godflight.

10:22.638 --> 10:24.039
I love these guys.

10:24.139 --> 10:27.643
They are totally
Jesus-centric and gorgeous.

10:30.437 --> 10:32.548
Veronica was adopted by her parents

10:32.648 --> 10:35.217
when they were missionaries in Vietnam.

10:35.317 --> 10:38.220
Hilary Faye sees her
as an example of God's will

10:38.320 --> 10:41.448
triumphing over a savage, godless nation.

10:42.658 --> 10:44.701
So what do you think of the new ride?

10:45.327 --> 10:47.604
You're so lucky, Hilary Faye.

10:47.704 --> 10:51.125
Yeah, I could've had
a Lexus gold edition, you know.

10:52.209 --> 10:54.737
Roland is blessed
with such a thoughtful sister.

10:54.837 --> 10:58.549
In countries like China, Hilary Faye
probably would've been killed at birth.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.744
And then where would you be, Roland?

11:01.844 --> 11:03.095
China.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.042
Welcome.

11:08.142 --> 11:09.810
You're one of us now.

11:11.228 --> 11:13.147
- What?
- Come on, pin it on.

11:19.528 --> 11:22.306
You guys, I'm not gonna have
any time to warm up now.

11:22.406 --> 11:23.849
- You will.
- Where's Dean?

11:23.949 --> 11:25.951
He knows I have to sing
at assembly this morning.

11:27.161 --> 11:28.270
He's coming.

11:28.370 --> 11:31.023
Can you go check?
Move him along a little bit?

11:31.123 --> 11:32.191
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.333
Not a problem.

11:43.594 --> 11:44.870
Is Dean ready?

11:44.970 --> 11:46.388
I...

11:47.014 --> 11:49.349
I found this under Dean's bed last night.

11:52.186 --> 11:55.297
He's on his way
to Mercy House this morning.

11:55.397 --> 11:57.399
He could be gone a long time.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.194
We thought you should know.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.029
But...

12:03.280 --> 12:04.907
I'm so sorry, Mary.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.242
Let's go.

12:13.624 --> 12:15.292
Is he coming out, or not?

12:16.752 --> 12:18.045
Not.

12:18.921 --> 12:21.365
Mercy House
is a Christian treatment facility

12:21.465 --> 12:24.326
where they deal with
everything from drug abuse,

12:24.426 --> 12:29.890
to alcoholism, to de-gayification,
and unwed mothers.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.730
I need to tell you guys something.

12:42.778 --> 12:45.055
What? It wasn't like it was
some kind of secret.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.616
The guy was like
a one-man gay pride parade.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.378
You know, we've never
had a gay at American Eagle.

13:00.129 --> 13:02.072
We're not gonna tell anyone, okay?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.257
Sure.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.427
Hilary Faye.

13:07.970 --> 13:10.956
- You promised me.
- Yeah, that's fine.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.750
What if you had married him?

13:12.850 --> 13:14.852
The gayness would be
passed on to your children.

13:20.983 --> 13:25.929
Cassandra Edelstein was the only
Jewish to ever attend American Eagles.

13:26.029 --> 13:29.224
She transferred in last year
amid rumors that she was a stripper.

13:29.324 --> 13:32.995
Everyone wanted to get her saved,
especially Hilary Faye.

13:33.954 --> 13:37.124
Hi, Cass. Welcome back.

13:39.626 --> 13:42.905
Smoking isn't just bad for you,
it's bad for all of us.

13:43.005 --> 13:44.698
Secondhand smoke kills.

13:44.798 --> 13:46.909
I'm counting on it.

13:47.009 --> 13:50.788
Oh, my gosh! Hilary Faye, are you okay?

13:50.888 --> 13:54.183
I bet she doesn't even have
a handicap permit for her car.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.020
And I'm right!

14:00.355 --> 14:02.316
Oh, my God.

14:09.031 --> 14:11.867
Come on. We don't want to be late
for homeroom, okay?

14:19.541 --> 14:21.043
Let's get to class.

14:22.419 --> 14:23.587
- Hi, Matt.
- Hey.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.015
- I'm a Jewel.
- Oh, it's awesome!

14:42.815 --> 14:44.967
Hey, guys, guess what?

14:45.067 --> 14:48.070
I think Jesus appeared to me
in my fish tank, and he...

14:49.530 --> 14:50.806
It's okay, it didn't move.

14:50.906 --> 14:53.517
The tank's kinda dirty
and most of the fish are dead,

14:53.617 --> 14:54.977
but my mom said if you guys...

14:55.077 --> 14:56.478
Okay, Tia, thanks.

14:56.578 --> 14:59.581
- I'll see you after class.
- I'll talk to you guys after class.

15:00.416 --> 15:03.986
I hope you all let God use you as a vessel

15:04.086 --> 15:06.255
for his divine plan this summer.

15:07.131 --> 15:10.326
I'm sure by now most of you
have noticed the beautiful billboard

15:10.426 --> 15:12.661
designed and painted
by our own Hilary Faye

15:12.761 --> 15:14.455
and donated by her father.

15:14.555 --> 15:15.848
Thank you.

15:16.932 --> 15:18.100
Mary helped.

15:18.892 --> 15:24.064
And speaking of new additions, class.
I'd like you to welcome Patrick Wheeler.

15:28.318 --> 15:33.515
Most of the boys in school looked
like NASA employees, not Patrick.

15:33.615 --> 15:35.100
There had to be a catch.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.561
Patrick is Pastor Skip's son.

15:37.661 --> 15:40.939
He's been in South America
doing missionary work with his mother,

15:41.039 --> 15:43.359
and this summer
he just completed a world tour

15:43.459 --> 15:45.152
with the Christian skateboard association.

15:45.252 --> 15:46.236
Nice.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.630
Out there hitting the board for the Lord?

15:49.631 --> 15:50.991
Is nothing sacred to you people?

15:51.091 --> 15:53.369
Before this morning's assembly,

15:53.469 --> 15:57.806
why don't we catch up
on what everyone did this summer?

15:58.724 --> 16:01.685
Mary, let's start with you.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.021
All right, everyone.

16:21.121 --> 16:25.250
Put your hands together
for the Christian Jewels!

16:29.838 --> 16:35.411
Some of the words to myself
would make the clouds disappear

16:35.511 --> 16:41.709
If you were gone, what would I become?

16:41.809 --> 16:45.754
You're so good to me

16:45.854 --> 16:47.089
I mean that.

16:47.189 --> 16:51.593
Oh, clarity

16:51.693 --> 16:54.763
Dear God

16:54.863 --> 16:57.766
A little piece of Heaven

16:57.866 --> 17:01.937
A little piece of Heaven in my world

17:02.037 --> 17:05.273
So, I figured they would've
sent you to a special school by now.

17:05.374 --> 17:07.709
This is a special school.

17:10.378 --> 17:11.380
No.

17:14.465 --> 17:17.328
I fell out of a tree when I was nine.

17:17.428 --> 17:18.996
Hilary Faye found me.

17:19.096 --> 17:22.082
She calls it
the miracle that saved my life.

17:22.182 --> 17:23.916
The miracle you could've used

17:24.017 --> 17:26.561
would've been not falling out
of the tree in the first place.

17:29.022 --> 17:30.065
Sorry.

17:31.066 --> 17:33.068
Is that why you're behind a year?

17:36.664 --> 17:37.831
Yeah.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.668
We should get back inside.

17:46.549 --> 17:47.675
Nice.

17:49.176 --> 17:52.555
- You want a push?
- Thanks.

17:55.849 --> 18:00.229
If you stare at my ass again.
I will push you off a cliff.

18:23.586 --> 18:26.589
Thank you, Jesus. Amen.

18:32.970 --> 18:34.054
All right!

18:38.976 --> 18:41.837
Welcome to the first assembly of the year!

18:41.937 --> 18:44.565
Give it up.
The Lord Jesus is in the house!

18:52.198 --> 18:55.684
Let's get our Christ on.
Let's kick it Jesus style.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.395
Y'all wanna walk
with the ultimate rebel, right?

18:58.495 --> 19:01.415
The ultimate CEO.
The biggest celebrity of them all.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.527
Who's down with G.O.D?

19:04.627 --> 19:07.087
I'm down with the G.O.D! That's right!

19:10.090 --> 19:13.219
Jesus Rules! Jesus Rules!

19:25.481 --> 19:26.649
Let's pray.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.386
Lord, we're gonna have
an awesome school year

19:30.486 --> 19:32.054
here at American Eagles Christian High...

19:32.154 --> 19:35.015
I know I'm not supposed
to ask for specifics, Lord,

19:35.115 --> 19:38.978
like when I prayed for an expensive car
and got the handicapper van instead,

19:39.078 --> 19:41.689
but I want this to be the best year ever.

19:41.789 --> 19:42.915
And between you and me...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.901
I think you'll agree I totally deserve it.

19:46.001 --> 19:49.405
Thank you for sparing me from
the eternal hellfires of damnation.

19:49.505 --> 19:52.408
I'm sorry I let that Promise Maker guy
touch me in the rectory.

19:52.508 --> 19:55.578
Daddy still hasn't stopped drinking,
but I know you're working on it.

19:55.678 --> 19:57.621
And I really want to be a Jewel.

19:57.721 --> 20:01.083
I wonder if rollerboy's paralyzed
everywhere below the waist.

20:01.183 --> 20:04.086
Oh, yeah, she digs me.

20:04.186 --> 20:06.755
Please, Jesus, don't let Dad humiliate me.

20:06.855 --> 20:09.133
Those Jesus freaks are on to something.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.761
Especially in front of her.

20:11.861 --> 20:15.739
About Dean and I, I thought we had a deal.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.826
Why is he at Mercy House?

20:19.952 --> 20:23.289
You did restore me, right?

20:24.915 --> 20:27.126
And keep our president safe.

20:28.544 --> 20:29.503
Amen.

20:30.212 --> 20:34.842
Now, who wants to come down here
and give their heart to the Lord?

20:36.051 --> 20:38.679
Who wants to start the year
off right and get saved?

20:39.388 --> 20:41.373
A lot of temptations over the summer.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.794
I bet some of you folks
backslid just a little.

20:44.894 --> 20:47.129
Who wants to recommit
themselves to the Lord?

20:47.229 --> 20:50.024
There we go! All right.

20:51.192 --> 20:53.360
All right. Praise Jesus.

20:54.528 --> 20:55.638
Fantastic.

20:55.738 --> 20:57.765
Praise Jesus. Come on down.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.910
- There you go.
- Awesome.

21:07.416 --> 21:10.377
Welcome home. Welcome home to Jesus.

21:10.711 --> 21:13.005
Welcome to his home. Jesus loves you.

21:15.591 --> 21:18.052
Praise Jesus. Accept him into your heart.

21:26.101 --> 21:27.978
Hallelujah!

21:31.649 --> 21:34.343
Hallelujah! Bear witness.

21:34.443 --> 21:36.612
She's speaking God's love language, folks!

21:38.113 --> 21:42.059
Oh, my God.
The Jew girl's speaking in tongues!

21:42.159 --> 21:44.854
She's gonna show her boobs.
Thank you, Jesus.

21:44.954 --> 21:46.564
She is! She's gonna show her boobs!

21:46.664 --> 21:50.443
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

21:50.543 --> 21:52.361
Mahh hotta pooosie!

21:52.461 --> 21:55.489
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

21:55.589 --> 21:59.535
Mahh possie is a hot pooosie!

21:59.635 --> 22:01.887
She's saying she's got a hot...

22:04.265 --> 22:10.880
After that, Cassandra's status
went from a cautionary tale to legend.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.717
It seemed like there was no act
too vulgar to get her expelled.

22:14.817 --> 22:16.819
The more she acted out...

22:17.945 --> 22:20.473
the more Hilary Faye
wanted to get her saved.

22:20.573 --> 22:25.411
I am totally glad she wasn't expelled.
Her actions are such a cry for help.

22:26.328 --> 22:28.481
She may not know this now,
but she is like...

22:28.581 --> 22:32.234
she's like that much closer
to accepting Jesus in her heart, right?

22:32.334 --> 22:36.489
Seriously, she could be some poor savage
in some remote jungle somewhere

22:36.589 --> 22:39.800
who will never know the Lord
and who will never go to Heaven, ever.

22:41.176 --> 22:44.430
I think that's why God has missionaries
like Patrick to spread his word.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.476
Yeah. What's up, guys?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.213
- You're Mary, right?
- Here's your board.

22:52.313 --> 22:54.006
- Thanks, bro.
- Yeah.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.759
You played the keyboard
during assembly. That was really cool.

22:56.859 --> 22:58.594
- Thanks.
- Isn't she great?

22:58.694 --> 23:03.032
She knows just how to compliment my
vocal stylings without overpowering them.

23:03.699 --> 23:07.328
We were just talking about
all your missionary work, it's so great.

23:08.037 --> 23:11.148
So, like, what part of the world
has the worst heathens?

23:11.248 --> 23:12.791
'Cause I'm so interested in that.

23:14.043 --> 23:17.321
Honestly, I couldn't say.
Mostly, I just stuck to skating.

23:17.421 --> 23:20.574
No, but how many of them
did you actually save, do you think?

23:20.674 --> 23:22.785
Guys, I totally scored
some free stuff for you.

23:22.885 --> 23:24.245
Thank you, Tia.

23:24.345 --> 23:26.455
Piss off, asshole!

23:26.555 --> 23:28.874
And another thing...
no more muffin for you.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.876
The muffin shop is closed!

23:30.976 --> 23:32.628
- Come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

23:32.728 --> 23:35.965
She is in worse shape
than I ever could have imagined, right?

23:36.065 --> 23:38.634
We need to show her
just how cool we Christians can be.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.237
- Totally.
- Let's start the laughing.

23:42.404 --> 23:43.906
Now!

23:47.910 --> 23:50.037
Cass, come join us. We're just...

23:51.539 --> 23:54.608
Do you wanna go wait in the van again?
Do you know these are new pants!

23:54.708 --> 23:57.586
You're handicapped, but get it together.

23:59.004 --> 24:02.199
Hey, Roland, how about we get outta here.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.743
And you can give me
a little spin in that thing?

24:04.843 --> 24:07.204
Release his parking brake, Hilary "Fake."

24:07.304 --> 24:10.332
You smell like Tia's dad.
Have you been drinking?

24:10.432 --> 24:11.517
Come on. Careful.

24:13.936 --> 24:15.880
I'm having a vision of the Virgin Mary.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.548
Cassandra, are you all right?

24:17.648 --> 24:20.509
What she needs to do
is accept Jesus into her heart.

24:20.609 --> 24:22.386
I think what she needs is a ride home.

24:22.486 --> 24:24.180
- I'll take her.
- I'll help you, then.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.514
Come on, Cassandra.

24:25.614 --> 24:27.741
No, no, let go of the pizza.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.119
Get off of me!

24:31.287 --> 24:33.689
Helping Patrick
haul Cassandra out of the mall

24:33.789 --> 24:36.525
was like the most perfect
God-centered moment.

24:36.625 --> 24:39.737
You really learn a lot about a boy
when you're servicing the Lord.

24:39.837 --> 24:41.906
Hilary Faye, I can see your pad.

24:42.006 --> 24:44.700
- I can see a little bit of it right...
- Quit it!

24:44.800 --> 24:49.705
Slowly raise up through the knees,
still bent at the waist, and roll to standing.

24:49.805 --> 24:50.831
Good.

24:50.931 --> 24:52.750
And twist and hold.

24:52.850 --> 24:55.895
Come on. Keep holding.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.006
I know what you're looking at, Mary.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.608
And Jesus does, too,

25:13.996 --> 25:17.358
After a threatening letter
from the State Board of Education,

25:17.458 --> 25:20.820
they finally broke down
and created a Sex-Ed class.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.072
A little too late, I might add.

25:23.172 --> 25:25.758
So, it's all about populating the planet.

25:26.592 --> 25:29.929
And good Christians don't
get jiggy with it until they're married.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.472
Lights.

25:34.767 --> 25:35.935
Yes, Mary.

25:38.520 --> 25:44.902
Is it possible Jesus might need us
to do his will by, you know, not waiting?

25:47.696 --> 25:49.974
Of course, he wants us to wait.

25:50.074 --> 25:53.118
I don't think I get what you mean, Mary.

25:55.663 --> 25:57.106
I don't know.

25:57.206 --> 26:00.985
Which variety of bass
is not indigenous to North America?

26:01.085 --> 26:02.611
- B... small mouth.
- Peacock.

26:02.711 --> 26:06.198
- Large mouth?
- I'm sorry. That's incorrect.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.242
This religious figure was best known

26:08.342 --> 26:11.579
for offering to God
a sacrifice of one of his sons.

26:11.679 --> 26:13.372
- Moses!
- Brenda.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.833
I... I'm guessing Abraham?

26:15.933 --> 26:17.960
- That's correct.
- Oh, really?

26:18.060 --> 26:21.255
- Congratulations. Well done.
- I hate this show.

26:21.355 --> 26:23.466
Coming up on Lifetime,

26:23.566 --> 26:26.969
Valerie Bertinelli
stars in "Bitter Harvest"...

26:27.069 --> 26:30.055
a sensitive portrayal
of one woman's struggle with cancer.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.740
This looks good.

26:33.075 --> 26:35.494
There was a feeling
of twilight in the air...

26:36.912 --> 26:39.482
all honeydew and lilac.

26:39.582 --> 26:41.792
God wasn't just smiling down on me...

26:42.877 --> 26:45.379
he was jumping up and cheering.

26:46.505 --> 26:47.798
And then, well...

26:49.341 --> 26:50.826
I thought I was pregnant.

26:50.926 --> 26:52.620
I'd been throwing up every morning

26:52.720 --> 26:55.164
and hadn't had my period in two months.

26:55.264 --> 26:57.625
So I took a home pregnancy test.

26:57.725 --> 26:59.101
What happened?

27:02.646 --> 27:04.398
I found out I wasn't pregnant.

27:06.317 --> 27:07.860
It was the cancer.

27:09.737 --> 27:12.907
She found all that out
from a home pregnancy test?

27:13.908 --> 27:18.020
Valerie's struggles made me realize
that my problems weren't so bad.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.565
Dean was getting help,
and I still had the Jewels.

27:21.665 --> 27:23.417
I was gonna be okay.

27:41.477 --> 27:44.380
- You work here, too?
- Yeah, I'm saving up for a car.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.107
When I get one I can
come pick you up and stuff.

27:48.359 --> 27:49.527
You okay?

27:50.027 --> 27:52.154
Yeah, it's just really hot in here.

27:52.988 --> 27:54.615
- I'll see you later.
- Promise?

28:00.955 --> 28:03.832
Please let it be cancer.
Please let it be cancer.

28:37.199 --> 28:41.036
The test mentions something
about a possible false positive.

28:46.584 --> 28:48.752
Do you have anything later on Monday?

28:52.715 --> 28:56.452
3:00? No, no, I can make that.

28:56.552 --> 29:00.431
I have my leadership meeting
tonight after work.

29:03.225 --> 29:05.753
- You're not wearing that, are you?
- Why not?

29:05.853 --> 29:07.396
You just can't, Mom.

29:09.064 --> 29:11.108
You're right, it's too hot for a sweater.

29:14.278 --> 29:16.614
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, hon.

29:20.242 --> 29:23.687
Hey, Mary.
Sorry to hear about Dean's faggotry.

29:23.787 --> 29:26.373
- What?
- See you at P, circle?

29:36.217 --> 29:37.468
Can I talk to you?

29:41.096 --> 29:42.973
What's going on?

29:43.849 --> 29:45.392
You promised me.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.298
It's hard.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.735
But I think this is the only way
we can actually help Dean.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.013
Don't you think?

29:58.113 --> 30:01.058
Come on. You're not born a gay.

30:01.158 --> 30:02.701
You're born-again.

30:03.327 --> 30:05.287
I don't know what I think anymore.

30:05.955 --> 30:07.581
I've gotta go.

30:08.290 --> 30:10.025
Wait. Don't you need me
to give you a ride home?

30:10.125 --> 30:11.610
Not today, Hil.

30:11.710 --> 30:15.089
Okay. Well, tonight
at the prayer circle meeting then, okay?

30:18.133 --> 30:20.995
Prayer circle meeting at my house at 7:00.

30:21.095 --> 30:24.098
I'm conducting it
for Mary's gay boyfriend Dean.

30:38.654 --> 30:39.780
What?

30:40.948 --> 30:43.450
You know where a guy can get some smokes?

30:58.674 --> 30:59.742
What's the matter?

30:59.842 --> 31:02.161
Scared to be seen
in public with a stripper?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.747
No. Scared of being seen with a cripple?

31:04.847 --> 31:06.265
I've been seen with worse.

31:06.849 --> 31:09.418
Hilary Faye's gonna freak out
when I'm not there waiting for her.

31:09.518 --> 31:10.686
Who cares?

31:12.271 --> 31:14.690
It's just that I don't
get out much on my own.

31:16.066 --> 31:19.153
- I'm not really a stripper.
- I'm not really a Christian.

31:21.405 --> 31:24.100
So, how did you end up at American Eagle?

31:24.200 --> 31:26.185
I mean, you're Jewish, right?

31:26.285 --> 31:28.771
Well, after I got expelled
from my last school,

31:28.871 --> 31:31.165
it was either here or home schooling.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.544
I figured I could handle
these freaks better than my parents.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.504
Lucky me.

31:39.006 --> 31:42.593
- Are you playing footsies with me?
- Wheelies.

31:44.803 --> 31:45.846
Hey, isn't that...

31:48.557 --> 31:50.292
What is she doing downtown?

31:50.392 --> 31:53.879
There's only one reason Christian girls
come down to the Planned Parenthood.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.966
- She's planting a pipe bomb?
- Okay, two reasons.

31:57.066 --> 31:58.509
With Dean?

31:58.609 --> 32:01.153
I think there's a better chance
of that pipe bomb.

32:04.907 --> 32:07.743
I... I should get home.

32:11.247 --> 32:12.748
Yeah, you should.

33:21.150 --> 33:22.276
Shit.

33:30.784 --> 33:31.827
Fuck.

33:43.797 --> 33:45.299
Goddamn.

33:48.969 --> 33:53.207
And we pray for all the perverts, Lord,
but especially for Dean,

33:53.307 --> 33:56.335
whom at this time,
just hasn't found the right girl.

33:56.435 --> 34:01.757
We join together and beg you
to rid him of his unnatural perversions.

34:01.857 --> 34:04.301
May you lead him
out of the darkness, Lord,

34:04.401 --> 34:06.929
and into your divine light.

34:07.029 --> 34:08.364
Amen.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.934
That was good. That felt really nice.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.770
Thank you so much for that good prayer.

34:14.870 --> 34:16.897
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

34:16.996 --> 34:20.109
How are you? So good to see you.
We've been waiting for you.

34:20.208 --> 34:23.696
We were just finishing up, so if you
have anything else you wanna add.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.614
Jesus is still listening.

34:25.714 --> 34:27.949
Jesus isn't listening, Hilary Faye.

34:28.050 --> 34:31.911
I did everything I could to save Dean,
and he still ended up at Mercy House.

34:32.012 --> 34:32.955
Let's take a breath...

34:33.054 --> 34:35.666
What can they say and do
that I haven't already done!

34:35.766 --> 34:36.792
Don't embarrass me!

34:36.891 --> 34:39.043
We have to pray about this. Prayer works!

34:39.143 --> 34:43.007
- It's been medically proven.
- Just lay off of me, Hilary!

34:43.107 --> 34:44.190
Wait a second.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.069
Give me that.

34:48.070 --> 34:50.906
You could pollute the Jewels
and everything we stand for.

34:52.116 --> 34:54.702
And I can't have that. Good-bye.

34:56.036 --> 34:58.455
I hope you know
that this is all a waste of time.

35:07.298 --> 35:09.633
I just got off the phone with Hilary Faye.

35:10.593 --> 35:13.095
Wow! Can she be an uppity whootie-who.

35:17.725 --> 35:19.101
What's the matter?

35:19.685 --> 35:20.728
Nothing.

35:21.937 --> 35:23.272
Come on.

35:28.819 --> 35:33.182
Why do you think Dean's parents
sent him away so fast?

35:33.282 --> 35:35.976
They probably thought
they couldn't handle it by themselves.

35:36.076 --> 35:39.688
Having a child is like owning a car...

35:39.788 --> 35:42.650
I can change the oil, fill the gas tank,

35:42.750 --> 35:45.361
take it to a carwash,
but if the carburetor broke.

35:45.461 --> 35:47.822
I wouldn't have a clue
as to how to fix it.

35:47.922 --> 35:51.408
What are you saying... you'd actually
send me to a place like Mercy House?

35:51.508 --> 35:54.053
Mary, please don't tell me
you're a lesbian.

35:59.642 --> 36:01.268
Should I be worried about you?

36:02.645 --> 36:05.397
I don't need to worry about you... do I?

36:07.983 --> 36:09.151
No.

36:13.948 --> 36:16.392
My mom just compared me to a car,

36:16.492 --> 36:19.061
so me having a baby

36:19.161 --> 36:22.731
definitely falls into the category
of things she couldn't handle.

36:22.831 --> 36:27.653
A week after prom
and two days after I turned eighteen,

36:27.753 --> 36:30.531
I was going to join
the unwed mothers club.

36:30.631 --> 36:34.385
Dean, I'm really sorry about what we did.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.621
I mean, we should've
at least used protection.

36:37.721 --> 36:39.498
But you're the only person I've been with.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.126
- No, I know that.
- I don't have anything.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.295
It's just... Dean, I really...

36:44.395 --> 36:46.589
I need to tell you something.

36:46.689 --> 36:49.650
- Hey, governor.
- Hi, Mitch.

36:51.694 --> 36:54.096
- Mitch?
- He's my roommate.

36:54.196 --> 36:56.390
He's here for the same reason as me.

36:56.490 --> 36:58.100
He even ran away from home
to San Francisco.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.478
He's like the worst one here.

37:00.578 --> 37:03.397
- You better be careful.
- I'm gonna beat this.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.708
According to the brochure,
hundreds of others have.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.751
What were you gonna say?

37:11.005 --> 37:12.715
Nothing. Just...

37:14.550 --> 37:16.994
I wanted to know if you'd be out by prom.

37:17.094 --> 37:19.663
- Wild horses couldn't stop me.
- Mercy House residents...

37:19.763 --> 37:21.999
I gotta go. We're doing
a Christian haunted house.

37:22.099 --> 37:23.267
Happy Halloween.

37:27.813 --> 37:31.066
Let's go, let's go. Let's pick it up.

37:35.029 --> 37:36.639
Nice costume.

37:36.739 --> 37:37.990
Thanks.

37:40.034 --> 37:42.036
'Cause we have the same...

37:46.832 --> 37:49.819
If you don't let go, I'll tell everybody
you touch me inappropriately

37:49.919 --> 37:51.654
while helping me in the bathroom.

37:51.754 --> 37:54.657
- Is that supposed to embarrass me?
- I'm tired of you pushing me around.

37:54.757 --> 37:57.743
Well, maybe I'm tired
of pushing you around.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.620
He's all yours!

37:59.720 --> 38:01.831
Thanks. Call me later, okay?

38:01.931 --> 38:04.208
He doesn't appreciate
one thing you do for him.

38:04.308 --> 38:07.211
Without the strength and love
that Jesus provides me,

38:07.311 --> 38:09.797
do you really think Cassandra's
gonna be able to take care of him?

38:09.897 --> 38:11.132
No way.

38:11.232 --> 38:13.008
She's just gonna end up hurting him.

38:13.108 --> 38:16.011
By the look of the bruises
on his neck, she already has.

38:16.111 --> 38:17.446
Tia, please.

38:17.571 --> 38:19.448
What are you supposed to be?

38:20.449 --> 38:21.534
A roller skate.

38:22.785 --> 38:24.645
I've got something to show you.

38:24.745 --> 38:25.913
You do?

38:34.171 --> 38:36.949
You didn't just do this
for the parking permit, did you?

38:37.049 --> 38:38.217
Pretty much.

38:39.802 --> 38:42.830
In the meantime,
I was trying to find a new religion

38:42.930 --> 38:45.207
or a new God or whatever,

38:45.307 --> 38:49.086
but to tell you the truth,
they were all kind of freaking me out.

38:49.186 --> 38:54.650
I mean, sure, they can't all be right,
but they can't all be wrong, right?

39:04.201 --> 39:06.520
You know, the whole
crystal thing is so felt up.

39:06.620 --> 39:09.064
Don't you have a church
to desecrate or something?

39:09.164 --> 39:11.166
Roland and I saw you
sneaking out of the clinic.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.336
Kudos on the Bono shades, by the way.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.281
I was distributing pamphlets.

39:17.381 --> 39:20.593
I was trying to prevent
girls like you from making a mistake.

39:21.886 --> 39:22.970
Thank you.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.956
After we win the costume contest,

39:26.056 --> 39:29.085
we'll distribute religious tracts
to the kids instead of candy.

39:29.185 --> 39:31.921
- Good one.
- That's awesome.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.063
Hey, ladies.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.425
- Sorry. You got a second?
- Yeah.

39:36.525 --> 39:38.819
Listen, I'm concerned about Mary.

39:39.153 --> 39:40.387
Something's going on.

39:40.487 --> 39:41.889
Yeah, me too.

39:41.989 --> 39:46.160
Well, she's part of your posse,
and I think that you could help her.

39:47.119 --> 39:50.147
I'm gonna need you to be a warrior
out on the front lines for Jesus.

39:50.247 --> 39:51.874
You mean like shoot her?

39:54.168 --> 39:57.780
No, no, I was thinking
of something a little less gangsta.

39:57.880 --> 40:01.826
I need someone who's spiritually armed
to help guide her back to her faith,

40:01.926 --> 40:04.495
to love and care
that only Jesus can supply.

40:04.595 --> 40:06.664
- You down with that?
- Yeah, I'm down with that.

40:06.764 --> 40:10.351
She's pretty vulnerable right now,
so I'm gonna need you to be extra gentle.

40:11.393 --> 40:14.380
- Hurry! Hurry! Come on!
- I'm going! I'm going!

40:14.480 --> 40:15.898
- Get her!
- Come on, Tia!

40:17.775 --> 40:19.568
Stuff her in here! Hurry up! Hurry Up!

40:24.073 --> 40:25.683
In the name of Jesus Christ.

40:25.783 --> 40:27.810
I command you,
leave the body of this servant of God.

40:27.910 --> 40:30.563
You're performing
an exorcism on me? Get off me!

40:30.663 --> 40:32.481
Where are you going? Get back here!

40:32.581 --> 40:34.358
We've gotta get rid of the evil in you.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.235
- It's God's will!
- God's will?

40:36.335 --> 40:39.488
- Christ died for your sins!
- Okay, wait a second.

40:39.588 --> 40:41.699
Are you not gonna accept our intervention?

40:41.799 --> 40:43.033
You mean kidnapping? No!

40:43.133 --> 40:45.327
You are backsliding
into the flames of hell.

40:45.427 --> 40:48.456
You've become a magnet for sin.
We've all witnessed it.

40:48.556 --> 40:50.875
Sure. Veronica acting all pure.

40:50.975 --> 40:53.544
What about last spring break
at the Promise Maker's rally?

40:53.644 --> 40:57.465
You are making accusations
as we're trying to save your soul?

40:57.565 --> 40:59.925
Mary, turn away from Satan.

41:00.025 --> 41:02.678
Jesus... he loves you.

41:02.778 --> 41:06.240
You don't know the first thing about love.

41:06.949 --> 41:09.410
I am filled with Christ's love!

41:10.327 --> 41:12.855
You are just jealous
of my success in the Lord.

41:12.955 --> 41:16.876
This is not a weapon, you idiot.

41:27.303 --> 41:30.431
What, did they send you to
strap me on the back of your scooter?

41:31.098 --> 41:33.851
Scooter? Mary, this is a Vespa.

41:34.852 --> 41:37.021
And I don't know
what you're talking about. Hop on.

41:38.731 --> 41:40.508
I'd rather walk.

41:40.608 --> 41:42.109
Suit yourself.

41:47.656 --> 41:49.767
She actually tried to exorcise you?

41:49.867 --> 41:50.868
Yeah.

41:51.619 --> 41:53.120
That was nice of her, I guess.

41:54.496 --> 41:57.333
The way things have been going.
I probably should've let her.

41:58.959 --> 42:00.127
Listen, Mary...

42:01.962 --> 42:04.573
I want you to know that I don't think
Dean's sick or anything.

42:04.673 --> 42:07.201
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

42:07.301 --> 42:10.579
Mercy House doesn't really exist
for the people who get sent there.

42:10.679 --> 42:13.249
It exists more for the people
who do the sending.

42:13.349 --> 42:16.685
So why were you at Hilary Faye's
when she was praying for Dean?

42:19.104 --> 42:20.147
Honestly...

42:22.191 --> 42:24.026
I thought you'd be there.

42:31.992 --> 42:34.854
Well, thank you for the ride, Patrick.

42:34.954 --> 42:36.288
Any time.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.672
Do you wanna go out sometime?

42:46.882 --> 42:49.326
What... are you gonna
take me out on your scooter?

42:49.426 --> 42:52.997
Come on. I'm, like, totally adorable.

42:53.097 --> 42:55.766
Besides, it would drive Hilary Faye crazy.

42:59.645 --> 43:02.898
I can't. I'm not dating right now.

43:04.066 --> 43:06.527
What about tomorrow night?
Will you be dating then?

43:09.238 --> 43:10.948
Good night, Patrick.

43:12.366 --> 43:14.034
Thank you so much.

43:14.368 --> 43:16.871
You guys are so sweet. You know what?

43:18.330 --> 43:19.373
We need to...

43:22.293 --> 43:23.444
We need to take a moment

43:23.544 --> 43:25.654
and think about those people
who aren't as fortunate

43:25.754 --> 43:27.740
to have the body of Christ
in their life right now.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.494
So, let's... let's pray for Mary.

43:31.594 --> 43:33.579
Lucky for me, at our school,

43:33.679 --> 43:37.792
teen pregnancy was about as common
as the flesh-eating virus.

43:37.892 --> 43:39.543
No one really seemed to catch on.

43:39.643 --> 43:40.711
All right, students...

43:40.811 --> 43:42.588
Except Cassandra.

43:42.688 --> 43:45.674
...and we're going to continue
with the Beatitudes.

43:45.774 --> 43:47.843
- Let's... Mary?
- Could I have a bathroom pass?

43:47.943 --> 43:49.220
- Sure.
- Thanks.

43:49.320 --> 43:52.014
Blessed are those who are persecuted
because of righteousness,

43:52.114 --> 43:54.350
for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.

43:54.450 --> 43:57.228
Blessed are you when people
insult you, persecute you,

43:57.328 --> 44:00.414
and falsely say all kinds of evil
against you because of me.

44:06.879 --> 44:07.922
Excuse me.

44:10.466 --> 44:13.202
It doesn't bother you to have
people smoking around you?

44:13.302 --> 44:14.803
It's so bad for the baby.

44:15.971 --> 44:18.599
I'm not pregnant, okay?

44:19.308 --> 44:22.895
So, what's your plan?
It's too late for the big A.

44:23.896 --> 44:27.383
You look like a smuggler.
I know somewhere you could sell it.

44:27.483 --> 44:28.984
I'm not gonna sell my...

44:36.784 --> 44:38.285
It's Dean's, isn't it?

44:40.579 --> 44:43.249
You can't do this on your own.

44:44.750 --> 44:46.001
Yes, I can.

44:47.545 --> 44:49.505
No, you can't.

44:57.972 --> 44:59.682
I thought I was helping him.

45:02.351 --> 45:03.686
I thought it was...

45:04.603 --> 45:06.564
what Jesus wanted me to do.

45:10.067 --> 45:11.902
That's pretty stupid, right?

45:13.404 --> 45:15.389
It's not stupid.

45:15.489 --> 45:18.284
- Yes, it is.
- It's not stupid.

45:28.544 --> 45:29.737
If you're interested.

45:29.837 --> 45:32.823
I know some people
who would pay a lot of money

45:32.923 --> 45:34.950
to take naked pictures of you
in a family way.

45:35.050 --> 45:38.012
Oh, yeah? How much money?

45:40.222 --> 45:42.057
You need to get out of here.

45:45.227 --> 45:46.812
Are we cutting?

45:53.944 --> 45:57.014
- Should you be driving?
- What is it with you people?

45:57.114 --> 45:59.475
You don't think
we can do anything, do you?

45:59.575 --> 46:02.520
No, I mean, you don't have
your license, do you?

46:02.620 --> 46:03.704
No.

46:09.543 --> 46:13.130
Here. Years of shoplifting
have taught me how to hide a bundle.

46:15.674 --> 46:18.828
Did I ever tell you about the time
that I shoplifted a frozen turkey

46:18.928 --> 46:22.765
out of a Piggly Wiggly wearing only
a tube top and some daisy dukes?

46:33.484 --> 46:35.569
I can't pay for all of this.

46:37.029 --> 46:38.864
Compliments of Hilary Faye.

46:45.621 --> 46:49.483
So, Patrick asked you out,
and you turned him down?

46:49.583 --> 46:52.736
The boy is a tomcat,
even if he is a big J.C. freak.

46:52.836 --> 46:57.491
And, double-plus bonus.
I'm pretty sure he's not a mo.

46:57.591 --> 47:00.661
He's Pastor Skip's son,
and I'm about to pop a baby out.

47:00.761 --> 47:03.706
I should tell Patrick to act gay.
Maybe then he'd get a little action.

47:03.806 --> 47:05.641
Nice, very nice.

47:09.144 --> 47:11.756
Does it ever bother you
that he can't walk?

47:11.856 --> 47:13.440
He can't walk?

47:14.984 --> 47:17.970
No, I mean it must be tricky, that's all.

47:18.070 --> 47:19.388
I don't care.

47:19.488 --> 47:23.659
- He gets me, and I get him.
- Cool.

47:23.993 --> 47:25.936
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

47:26.036 --> 47:27.188
Check this out.

47:27.288 --> 47:30.399
I got a candy bar and a whole nickel.

47:30.499 --> 47:31.567
Oh, Jesus.

47:31.667 --> 47:34.795
Don't look now, but bitch face
is here with your boyfriend.

47:36.839 --> 47:37.965
Hey, guys.

47:38.883 --> 47:40.342
Merry Christmas.

47:43.679 --> 47:45.306
What's wrong with her?

47:45.973 --> 47:47.249
It's nothing.

47:47.349 --> 47:51.921
I just get this really left-out feeling
around Christmas time, you know?

47:52.021 --> 47:53.647
Jewish.

47:54.356 --> 47:57.009
Well, if you decided
to accept Christ into your heart,

47:57.109 --> 48:00.279
then you and your people
could join in on the fun, too.

48:01.238 --> 48:03.199
We should go.

48:04.158 --> 48:05.284
Bye, guys.

48:06.535 --> 48:09.163
- Wait!
- What?

48:10.164 --> 48:12.608
- You're right.
- I am?

48:12.708 --> 48:14.610
I wanna join in on the fun.

48:14.710 --> 48:16.737
I don't want a Hanukkah bush this year.

48:16.837 --> 48:18.781
I want a Christmas tree.

48:18.881 --> 48:21.450
- You're kidding me again, right?
- I wanna get saved.

48:21.550 --> 48:25.287
I want a relationship
with Jesus Christ, for real.

48:25.387 --> 48:29.141
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

48:30.726 --> 48:33.729
Okay. This is gonna
be pretty intense, Patrick.

48:35.189 --> 48:37.399
I don't have all of
my equipment with me, but...

48:38.776 --> 48:40.344
Okay, sit down.

48:40.444 --> 48:45.641
First of all, we need to have you
confess all of your sins out loud.

48:45.741 --> 48:47.643
Well, there's all the swears.

48:47.743 --> 48:50.646
I mean, I have
a pretty goddamn dirty mouth.

48:50.746 --> 48:53.707
And then there's the sex.
I mean, are we counting oral?

48:55.125 --> 48:57.461
So, Christmas shopping with Hilary Faye?

48:58.337 --> 49:01.824
No, no, I just
ran into her here, honestly.

49:01.924 --> 49:04.093
She's helping me pick out
some last-minute gifts.

49:06.637 --> 49:09.123
- Come here. Sorry.
- What are you doing, Patrick?

49:09.223 --> 49:10.833
I just wanna see what's in here.

49:10.933 --> 49:12.293
- But...
- No, no, come on.

49:12.393 --> 49:14.879
- We're not allowed...
- Just for a second.

49:14.979 --> 49:19.066
- I don't think we should be in here.
- Yes, we should definitely be in here.

49:44.508 --> 49:45.676
It's incredible.

49:59.398 --> 50:00.733
I like you, Mary.

50:02.318 --> 50:03.611
I really do.

50:04.695 --> 50:05.779
Why?

50:07.698 --> 50:08.866
You're beautiful.

50:10.326 --> 50:11.785
And you speak for yourself.

50:12.453 --> 50:14.313
God gave us all free will,

50:14.413 --> 50:18.192
and that day
at Hilary Faye's prayer circle,

50:18.292 --> 50:20.169
you weren't afraid to use it.

50:21.253 --> 50:22.588
You inspired me.

50:25.007 --> 50:26.884
You amaze me, Mary.

50:35.392 --> 50:37.086
This is a bad idea. I knew it.

50:37.186 --> 50:40.798
- Wait a minute.
- You're not my type, Patrick.

50:40.898 --> 50:42.650
Why? Why not?

50:43.651 --> 50:44.944
I'm sorry.

50:46.862 --> 50:47.988
Mary, wait.

50:53.994 --> 50:55.663
Thanks.

51:04.380 --> 51:07.908
So, I duct taped a piece of rotten bacon
inside Hilary Faye's locker.

51:08.008 --> 51:09.118
That's disgusting.

51:09.218 --> 51:12.455
She made me listen to
the entire Elms CD on her iPOD.

51:12.555 --> 51:14.540
I didn't ask you to get saved.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.958
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

51:16.058 --> 51:18.335
Last year I got saved
so I could go on a ski trip.

51:18.435 --> 51:20.020
Oh, my God!

51:22.356 --> 51:23.632
How do you feel?

51:23.732 --> 51:26.135
I'm a whole new girl, Hay Faye.

51:26.235 --> 51:29.196
I told you! How great is Jesus?

51:31.740 --> 51:36.412
About that, I've decided
to devote my life to Satan instead.

51:37.413 --> 51:38.497
Thanks, though!

51:39.164 --> 51:40.332
What?

51:45.087 --> 51:47.214
Who beefed?

51:48.424 --> 51:52.077
She was found to be pregnant
through the Holy Spirit.

51:52.177 --> 51:54.663
When he had contemplated this,
an angel of the Lord

51:54.763 --> 51:58.542
appeared to him in a dream
and said, "Joseph, son of David,

51:58.642 --> 52:01.295
"do not be afraid
to take Mary as your wife

52:01.395 --> 52:05.841
"because the child conceived in her
is from the Holy Spirit.

52:05.941 --> 52:09.929
Behold, a virgin shall conceive
and bear a son."

52:10.029 --> 52:12.181
I know this is, like, totally wrong,

52:12.281 --> 52:15.226
but don't you ever wonder
if she made the whole thing up?

52:15.326 --> 52:17.770
I mean, you have to admit it's a good one.

52:17.870 --> 52:21.248
It's not like anyone could use
virgin birth as an excuse again.

52:22.958 --> 52:24.985
I don't really think she made it up,

52:25.085 --> 52:27.254
but I could understand why a girl would.

52:28.631 --> 52:30.658
Quit being so stingy.

52:30.758 --> 52:33.410
What? They're my
Valentine's Day chocolates.

52:33.510 --> 52:36.931
Hilary Faye, you bought them
for yourself, so it doesn't count.

52:39.058 --> 52:40.584
You still have that?

52:40.684 --> 52:43.170
I haven't decided
if I wanna give it to him yet.

52:43.270 --> 52:44.980
Well, you better decide fast.

52:50.986 --> 52:52.821
Happy Valentine's Day.

52:53.656 --> 52:55.783
- Thank you.
- I made it myself.

53:00.663 --> 53:02.790
It's a dumb idea anyway.

53:29.275 --> 53:32.261
Mary's been going through
a lot of changes this year, and...

53:32.361 --> 53:34.572
a relationship is the last thing
she needs right now.

53:35.948 --> 53:38.033
Yeah, you're the relationship expert.

53:39.410 --> 53:41.270
You and Mom don't even talk any more.

53:41.370 --> 53:43.481
That's because your mom
has her missionary position,

53:43.581 --> 53:46.567
and I have my responsibilities
running the school, and...

53:46.667 --> 53:48.944
Mom told me everything this summer.

53:49.044 --> 53:51.672
Why didn't you just get divorced
when she wanted to?

53:53.674 --> 53:55.951
Because divorce is not part of God's plan.

53:56.051 --> 53:59.430
Dad, you need to think of a new plan.

54:02.933 --> 54:05.294
I thought you were
at your meeting with Pastor Skip.

54:05.394 --> 54:07.296
It got cancelled.

54:07.396 --> 54:11.133
Again?
That's, like, three times this week?

54:11.233 --> 54:12.276
Four.

54:14.904 --> 54:18.140
Well, do you wanna talk about it?

54:18.240 --> 54:21.076
I think this one's between me and Jesus.

54:22.912 --> 54:25.314
But do you wanna talk?

54:25.414 --> 54:26.540
No.

54:32.171 --> 54:33.823
I keep trying to remind myself

54:33.923 --> 54:37.076
that when Jesus shuts a door,
he opens a window.

54:37.176 --> 54:40.179
Yeah, so we have something
we can jump out of.

54:50.356 --> 54:53.175
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

54:53.275 --> 54:57.680
I'm trying to get the board to okay
this new youth outreach program...

54:57.780 --> 55:03.018
you get the kids into the church
via rock music concerts.

55:03.118 --> 55:07.356
One of the board members says,
"Hey, I can't tell the difference

55:07.456 --> 55:10.985
between Christian rock
and secular rock anymore."

55:11.085 --> 55:14.321
And I said, "Dude, exactly."

55:14.421 --> 55:17.199
You get their attention, and then
you hit them with the message,

55:17.299 --> 55:19.577
and boom, you've saved another soul.

55:19.677 --> 55:21.370
- Skip.
- What?

55:21.470 --> 55:22.930
I don't care.

55:23.806 --> 55:25.624
- You don't care?
- I've missed you.

55:25.724 --> 55:27.977
I've missed our meetings.

55:28.811 --> 55:32.815
I feel good when I'm with you.
I think you feel good, too.

55:39.321 --> 55:41.365
I've missed you, too, yeah.

55:42.283 --> 55:45.853
I wonder why God would give us
these feelings of happiness,

55:45.953 --> 55:49.732
if what we're doing is wrong.

55:49.832 --> 55:51.942
What are we doing, Lillian?

55:52.042 --> 55:54.837
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of, Skip.

55:58.340 --> 56:01.368
Is this how people
turn away from Christ's teachings?

56:01.468 --> 56:02.678
I mean, I...

56:04.346 --> 56:08.167
All the... all the bible study I've done,

56:08.267 --> 56:11.896
all the preaching
I've done to the kids, and...

56:13.355 --> 56:18.360
all the prayers
for forgiveness I've prayed, and...

56:23.657 --> 56:25.534
All I can think about is...

56:26.994 --> 56:28.787
kissing you.

56:30.122 --> 56:32.875
I want... I want to kiss you.

56:37.129 --> 56:38.464
Then kiss me.

56:54.188 --> 56:57.883
By Easter, it seemed Jesus
had answered my mom's prayers,

56:57.983 --> 57:01.595
and she was as happy as she was
when she first got back from Orlando.

57:01.695 --> 57:04.640
I'm probably gonna be late tonight
'cause I have my meeting.

57:04.740 --> 57:07.643
I know. What, are you
meeting twice a week now?

57:07.743 --> 57:09.370
Or petrol, you could do petrol.

57:11.497 --> 57:15.417
Pastor Skip suggested Patrick take
more interest in school activities.

57:16.377 --> 57:19.363
He said that by focusing
his energies on the Lord,

57:19.463 --> 57:21.882
he would have less time
to think about dating.

57:23.008 --> 57:27.888
Or I should say, he would have
less time to think about dating me.

57:36.772 --> 57:40.359
Now, that's what I call
being hung on a cross.

57:50.744 --> 57:54.190
Patrick and I and everyone...
we're gonna go grab some food.

57:54.290 --> 57:57.334
- If you guys wanna come, that'd be cool.
- We're going to DQ.

57:57.835 --> 58:01.297
So we can watch Hilary Faye
try and get into your Easter basket?

58:01.422 --> 58:02.448
No, thanks.

58:02.548 --> 58:07.620
Cassandra, it's not too late to achieve
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

58:07.720 --> 58:11.373
Eternal damnation's
not fit for anyone, not even you.

58:11.473 --> 58:12.958
- Right?
- Good one.

58:13.058 --> 58:15.586
I should kick your fat,
Christian ass right now.

58:15.686 --> 58:17.630
Really? Do you know
that I could get you expelled

58:17.730 --> 58:19.882
for that type of language, Edelstein?

58:19.982 --> 58:22.635
- And I'm not even fat, okay?
- Your head is fat!

58:22.735 --> 58:24.386
And your ass is fat!

58:24.486 --> 58:25.888
- Whatever!
- It's like she's retarded!

58:25.988 --> 58:28.641
I'm two months away from getting
outta here without anyone knowing.

58:28.741 --> 58:33.370
Just... it's hard, but cool it, okay?

58:34.079 --> 58:36.123
Next time, the bitch is going down.

58:37.249 --> 58:38.400
I'm sorry.

58:38.500 --> 58:40.336
I wanna show you something.

58:43.297 --> 58:45.507
It's a sonogram I took a while ago.

58:46.634 --> 58:48.260
I'm having a little girl.

58:48.928 --> 58:50.663
You sure you're not having a sea monkey?

58:50.763 --> 58:53.182
- Yeah.
- She's beautiful.

58:54.183 --> 58:56.585
You think it's safe
to keep this in your locker?

58:56.685 --> 58:58.521
- Safer than at home.
- Let's go.

59:00.231 --> 59:04.760
I don't really get how someone
so pretty can be so... ugly.

59:04.860 --> 59:06.178
She wasn't always pretty.

59:06.278 --> 59:09.306
My parents didn't want two handicapped
kids, and she was the easy fix.

59:09.406 --> 59:11.058
What do you mean "handicapped?"

59:11.158 --> 59:12.268
Before we moved to Cherry Hill,

59:12.368 --> 59:14.478
before the fat camps and Tetracycline,

59:14.578 --> 59:16.413
her outside matched her inside.

59:25.339 --> 59:27.007
Oh, my God.

59:28.801 --> 59:31.996
- Just make sure you put this back.
- I'll take care of it tonight.

59:32.096 --> 59:33.914
- What are you doing with that?
- Nothing.

59:34.014 --> 59:36.225
Well, well, well.

59:37.393 --> 59:38.627
If it isn't the heathens.

59:38.727 --> 59:42.064
Burn in hell,
you narrow-minded, tacky-ass bitch.

59:44.191 --> 59:46.135
Burn in hell, you narrow-minded...

59:46.235 --> 59:48.179
- She doesn't mean it.
- Yes, I do!

59:48.279 --> 59:50.698
You're gonna be expelled for sure
for threatening me!

59:54.743 --> 59:58.314
Pastor Skip put us on work detail
for Hilary Faye's prom committee.

59:58.414 --> 01:00:00.357
You better be wearing
underpants this time.

01:00:00.457 --> 01:00:02.276
A particularly cruel punishment.

01:00:02.376 --> 01:00:04.211
No, seriously, move it higher.

01:00:05.296 --> 01:00:07.114
- Higher!
- You're doing a great job.

01:00:07.214 --> 01:00:08.991
It's looking really phat.

01:00:09.091 --> 01:00:10.509
I'm so glad.

01:00:12.678 --> 01:00:14.847
Hey, Mary, you need some help?

01:00:15.598 --> 01:00:17.725
- Sure, thanks.
- I'll come to you.

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:26.734
So, listen, I was wondering,
what are you doing the night of prom?

01:00:26.901 --> 01:00:28.803
Why? Are you asking me to prom?

01:00:28.903 --> 01:00:29.945
Maybe.

01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:34.391
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:36.393
Yeah, okay, I'll go with you.

01:00:36.493 --> 01:00:38.162
As friends.

01:00:42.499 --> 01:00:44.235
Okay, as friends.

01:00:44.335 --> 01:00:46.487
I thought you were gonna
ask Patrick to the prom.

01:00:46.587 --> 01:00:48.197
Tia, would you just shut up?

01:00:48.297 --> 01:00:50.533
Do you wanna go back to being
invisible girl with bad hair?

01:00:50.633 --> 01:00:52.243
That could easily happen.

01:00:52.343 --> 01:00:55.037
Just don't ask stupid questions!

01:00:55.137 --> 01:00:56.472
Did you take care of business?

01:00:59.391 --> 01:01:00.893
Now, where are you going?

01:01:01.894 --> 01:01:04.797
You can tacky-up prom
on your own, because I quit.

01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:07.174
Oh, my gosh. You can't quit.

01:01:07.274 --> 01:01:10.094
Watch me. Watch me walking away.

01:01:10.194 --> 01:01:11.946
Watch me walking away from Jesus.

01:01:12.488 --> 01:01:13.489
What?

01:01:14.156 --> 01:01:16.075
Yes, this is she. Who is this?

01:01:16.951 --> 01:01:18.827
Are you serious?

01:01:21.163 --> 01:01:23.082
Thank you so much.

01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:28.837
Godflight has agreed to perform
at our prom! Can you believe that?

01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:31.615
Prayer works for everything! I told you.

01:01:31.715 --> 01:01:35.745
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm so excited.

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:37.972
Now she's never gonna shut up.

01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:41.100
Give her about ten minutes.

01:01:59.034 --> 01:02:01.645
Turn them off! Turn them off now, please!

01:02:01.745 --> 01:02:02.913
Turn them...

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.111
What?

01:02:09.211 --> 01:02:10.946
It's not fair.

01:02:11.046 --> 01:02:15.076
I am trying to be a good Christian
and a living example of Christ's love,

01:02:15.176 --> 01:02:18.579
and I have done nothing
but bust my buns for those sinners.

01:02:18.679 --> 01:02:21.123
And you know that Cassandra
and Mary are behind this.

01:02:21.223 --> 01:02:22.625
Do you have proof?

01:02:22.725 --> 01:02:25.978
I gave you proof before,
and you did not do one thing about it.

01:02:26.979 --> 01:02:30.691
Those who did this will not escape
the eyes of God, Hilary Faye.

01:02:38.949 --> 01:02:41.143
Please, Lord, don't leave me alone.

01:02:41.243 --> 01:02:44.413
They need to know
that what they've done is wrong.

01:02:49.084 --> 01:02:53.088
Please, Lord, please.
Just tell me what I need to do.

01:03:01.764 --> 01:03:03.624
Listen, by the end of the week
we're out of here.

01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:06.393
- She can't do anything.
- No, I know.

01:03:08.687 --> 01:03:10.105
What's going on?

01:03:10.814 --> 01:03:12.007
Oh, my God.

01:03:12.107 --> 01:03:14.985
- Somebody call the police.
- Can you believe it?

01:03:15.903 --> 01:03:19.657
No way. This is screwed up.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.368
Oh, my God.

01:03:23.244 --> 01:03:25.663
Holy crap!

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:30.815
- That's sad.
- Turn away. Turn away.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.699
All right. Everybody,
let's get to our classes, please.

01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:39.385
- You two come in with me.
- What?

01:03:41.053 --> 01:03:44.098
Unacceptable.
I can't even concentrate today.

01:03:48.978 --> 01:03:50.604
Get to class, ladies. Go on.

01:03:54.358 --> 01:03:56.026
What? That's not mine!

01:04:03.367 --> 01:04:06.120
- Pastor Skip.
- Anything else?

01:04:16.547 --> 01:04:18.132
No, nothing more.

01:04:24.513 --> 01:04:25.806
What is that?

01:04:31.353 --> 01:04:32.914
- Someone get the nurse!
- Just hang on.

01:04:35.232 --> 01:04:36.833
I can't believe we were friends with her.

01:04:38.861 --> 01:04:41.030
You have everything, Hilary Faye.

01:04:41.864 --> 01:04:43.657
What are you afraid of?

01:04:46.035 --> 01:04:49.538
So you offered up
your virginity to save Dean?

01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:53.792
Because Jesus told you to?

01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:57.838
- Anything else?
- No.

01:04:58.672 --> 01:05:01.175
Can I have a word with you?

01:05:06.805 --> 01:05:08.541
What's the matter, Skip?

01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:10.684
You didn't know that she was pregnant?

01:05:11.435 --> 01:05:14.422
I thought she was stress eating,
I didn't want her to get a complex.

01:05:14.522 --> 01:05:18.901
You are so blinded by this...
that you can't even see it.

01:05:19.902 --> 01:05:21.262
Let me spell it out to you.

01:05:21.362 --> 01:05:27.226
God is punishing us for our sin
by getting our attention through Mary.

01:05:27.326 --> 01:05:28.686
That doesn't even make sense.

01:05:28.786 --> 01:05:31.897
And the longer we lived in sin,
the worse things got for her.

01:05:31.997 --> 01:05:35.025
And what's worse is we're not
spiritually right with the Lord,

01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:37.878
and we are not fit to help her.

01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:45.995
Dean has been here
for almost a year, okay?

01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:47.888
They can help her.

01:05:49.473 --> 01:05:51.058
I wanna think about it.

01:05:52.434 --> 01:05:55.421
If you're not gonna send her
to get the help she needs.

01:05:55.521 --> 01:05:57.314
I can't see you any more.

01:05:59.567 --> 01:06:00.926
Cassandra, wait!

01:06:01.026 --> 01:06:03.846
He expelled me! Can you believe that?

01:06:03.946 --> 01:06:06.766
And the one time I didn't do anything.

01:06:06.866 --> 01:06:08.367
Well, I'll go with you.

01:06:11.912 --> 01:06:14.081
I can't deal with this right now,
I have to go.

01:06:15.332 --> 01:06:16.500
Wait!

01:06:24.925 --> 01:06:26.302
I don't have a ride.

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.287
Please help me find him.

01:08:31.176 --> 01:08:33.595
You know where a girl can get some smokes?

01:08:44.064 --> 01:08:45.508
You never fold things.

01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:48.068
Well, I'm folding now.

01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:50.386
I'm not going to Mercy House.

01:08:50.487 --> 01:08:52.848
We agreed that this is for the best.

01:08:52.948 --> 01:08:54.183
We? Who's we?

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:57.895
Pastor Skip said this child needs
to be raised by a mother and a father.

01:08:57.995 --> 01:08:59.688
So I don't even get a say in this?

01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:02.457
You're not prepared
to raise this child by yourself!

01:09:05.794 --> 01:09:08.506
Something like this could
ruin the rest of your life.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.620
So, what, did I ruin yours, Mom?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.555
Don't talk like that.

01:09:22.603 --> 01:09:24.462
It looks so perfect.

01:09:24.563 --> 01:09:26.549
Just like the picture that I brought in.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:27.733
Thank you.

01:09:30.611 --> 01:09:32.446
Crap.

01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:36.617
I'm sorry, but it's been declined.
Do you have another card?

01:09:40.996 --> 01:09:42.231
I knew it.

01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:46.652
Listen, I'm really sorry
I ditched you yesterday.

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:49.046
Look, this year has been great.

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:54.243
Before you, it was all about Hilary Faye
dragging my ass around all the time.

01:09:54.343 --> 01:09:57.555
When you left yesterday,
I stuck on my own.

01:09:58.764 --> 01:10:00.474
And it was okay.

01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:03.335
So...

01:10:03.435 --> 01:10:08.758
So I realized that I might
just be relying on you

01:10:08.858 --> 01:10:12.261
the same way I was relying on Hilary Faye.

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:16.490
I don't wanna be the guy who's
with the girl because he needs her.

01:10:17.283 --> 01:10:20.369
I wanna be the guy who's
with the girl because he wants her.

01:10:22.496 --> 01:10:23.747
And I want you.

01:10:25.708 --> 01:10:27.459
I want you, too.

01:10:32.089 --> 01:10:34.450
And I thought it was all about the sex.

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.844
Oh, well, that too.

01:10:38.179 --> 01:10:42.224
Look, I have
this crazy idea about tonight.

01:10:50.608 --> 01:10:52.735
Mary, Roland's on the phone.

01:10:53.777 --> 01:10:54.945
I got it.

01:10:56.947 --> 01:10:58.699
What's going on?

01:11:06.415 --> 01:11:09.627
- Hello. Where you headed?
- Lombard and Kale, please.

01:11:20.262 --> 01:11:21.931
You guys look incredible.

01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:25.000
You're not really going to prom, are you?

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:29.605
Don't get angry,
but I got you a really sexy dress.

01:11:30.564 --> 01:11:33.384
Hilary Faye's gonna call the cops
if we show up at her prom.

01:11:33.484 --> 01:11:34.677
No, she won't.

01:11:34.777 --> 01:11:36.095
See, I've been snagging
all her credit card bills

01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:38.973
so she wouldn't find out about
all the charges we made, right?

01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:40.015
Look at this.

01:11:40.115 --> 01:11:43.018
She charged a bunch
of spray paint at Home Depot

01:11:43.118 --> 01:11:44.854
at 3 A.M. on the morning of the attack.

01:11:44.954 --> 01:11:46.397
Now we have proof.

01:11:46.497 --> 01:11:48.916
We have every right to be at that prom.

01:11:51.835 --> 01:11:55.631
Oh, yeah.
We've got another surprise for you.

01:12:23.158 --> 01:12:24.143
So cute.

01:12:24.243 --> 01:12:27.354
I got yellow and red
'cause I didn't know which one...

01:12:27.454 --> 01:12:28.789
But, Patrick...

01:12:32.084 --> 01:12:34.587
It really doesn't matter to me.

01:12:36.505 --> 01:12:37.965
Are you sure?

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.803
Yeah.

01:13:01.614 --> 01:13:02.932
Red. Right.

01:13:03.032 --> 01:13:07.269
I can't believe that you guys
did all of this for me.

01:13:07.369 --> 01:13:08.787
So, you in?

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.500
I'm in.

01:13:14.126 --> 01:13:16.278
I knew Mary was hiding something.

01:13:16.378 --> 01:13:20.950
To imagine her humping that pervert
makes me sick to my stomach.

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:23.385
- Gross.
- And Roland still hasn't shown up.

01:13:23.511 --> 01:13:26.038
I can't believe your own brother
calls you the "C" word.

01:13:26.138 --> 01:13:28.599
I can't believe we have to go
to the prom in this van.

01:13:29.183 --> 01:13:31.210
Yeah, well, get over it, okay?

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:34.797
When I tried to pay for my hair, my
credit card was mysteriously maxed out,

01:13:34.897 --> 01:13:38.134
and the limo guy wouldn't take
a personal check. Get off my back!

01:13:38.234 --> 01:13:40.219
It's bad enough we don't have dates.

01:13:40.319 --> 01:13:42.555
Hey, let me try that tiara on.

01:13:42.655 --> 01:13:44.198
Lay off the tiara, Tia!

01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:54.500
Your pimple hardly shows, Hilary Faye.

01:13:55.417 --> 01:13:56.777
Come on, Tia! Let's get the lead out!

01:13:56.877 --> 01:13:58.671
Let's go. We're gonna be late.

01:13:59.505 --> 01:14:01.157
Coming.

01:14:01.257 --> 01:14:03.242
- Okay?
- You look beautiful.

01:14:03.342 --> 01:14:04.660
You can hardly see that thing.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.037
Can you stop bringing it up? Thank you.

01:14:07.137 --> 01:14:10.057
Let's go. Come on, Tia. Walk fast.

01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:11.917
Run.

01:14:12.017 --> 01:14:15.171
Name the most recognizable
figure in the world.

01:14:15.271 --> 01:14:16.881
Jesus Christ.

01:14:16.981 --> 01:14:19.425
- Madonna?
- Jesus Christ.

01:14:19.525 --> 01:14:22.636
Newborns bond with their mothers
during the first three what?

01:14:22.736 --> 01:14:24.764
- Minutes.
- Months.

01:14:24.864 --> 01:14:27.475
No! The correct answer is minutes.

01:14:27.575 --> 01:14:28.684
In "The Wizard of Oz,"

01:14:28.784 --> 01:14:32.521
Dorothy clicks her heels
three times and says what?

01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:33.873
Charlene.

01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:52.416
Are you ready?

01:14:52.516 --> 01:14:55.294
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:14:55.394 --> 01:14:56.437
Why are they here?

01:16:10.803 --> 01:16:14.139
Praise Jesus, everybody! Jesus loves you!

01:16:15.975 --> 01:16:18.686
We're taking a short break.
We'll be back in ten.

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:27.862
We will inherit the earth. Praise Jesus.

01:16:31.073 --> 01:16:32.641
On behalf of the prom committee.

01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:34.602
I wanna thank each and every one of you

01:16:34.702 --> 01:16:37.980
for making our "Light of the World"
prom a huge success.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.832
Give yourself a round of applause.

01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:46.447
But on a sadder note...
I don't want to dampen the evening...

01:16:46.547 --> 01:16:48.908
but the students who were responsible

01:16:49.008 --> 01:16:53.512
for the attacks on our school
have infiltrated our prom.

01:16:55.764 --> 01:16:57.625
Pastor Skip?

01:16:57.725 --> 01:17:00.628
Mary Cummings and Cassandra Edelstein
have crashed our prom.

01:17:00.728 --> 01:17:02.922
- Could you please...
- Maybe we should get out of here.

01:17:03.022 --> 01:17:04.356
We're not going anywhere.

01:17:06.609 --> 01:17:10.721
Roland, where have you been?
I've been very worried about you.

01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:12.239
You look like you survived.

01:17:14.491 --> 01:17:15.576
- Excuse me.
- Finally.

01:17:16.118 --> 01:17:17.311
All right. Chill out, everybody.

01:17:17.411 --> 01:17:20.022
I don't think these students
are here to do us any harm.

01:17:20.122 --> 01:17:22.441
- What? Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:26.237
I think the Christian thing to do
would be to let them stay.

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:28.531
The Christian thing to do?

01:17:28.631 --> 01:17:31.534
I've been doing
the Christian thing my entire life.

01:17:31.634 --> 01:17:35.746
I did not have sex with a gay
and try and blame it on Jesus.

01:17:35.846 --> 01:17:39.375
- Just cool it, Hil.
- Shut up, you fornicator.

01:17:39.475 --> 01:17:42.253
And I did not hack into
the school's computer system

01:17:42.353 --> 01:17:45.381
and cover our walls
with that blasphemous graffiti, either.

01:17:45.481 --> 01:17:48.901
You planted that paint on Cassandra
and Mary to get them kicked out of school.

01:17:50.694 --> 01:17:52.154
That's such a lie.

01:17:52.988 --> 01:17:54.390
Oh, please.

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:55.808
And what does this prove,

01:17:55.908 --> 01:17:59.245
except the fact that you stole
my credit card to charge the paint...

01:18:00.371 --> 01:18:03.332
and the clothes from Maternity Girl.

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:08.195
Yeah, she's right, Roland.
Anybody could've made these charges.

01:18:08.295 --> 01:18:12.258
Oh, yeah? You swear to God
you didn't frame us, Hilary Faye?

01:18:13.425 --> 01:18:14.535
No, I will not.

01:18:14.635 --> 01:18:16.203
You can't swear, can you?

01:18:16.303 --> 01:18:18.080
Go ahead, swear it.

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.766
Come on, Hil. Swear before God
and everyone else.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.776
All right, I swear.

01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:35.239
I swear to God
I did not graffiti our school.

01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:38.701
Are you guys happy?

01:18:39.827 --> 01:18:41.579
Oh, yes, you did, Hilary Faye.

01:18:42.705 --> 01:18:45.332
I found this crammed up under her seat.

01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:47.626
What?

01:18:48.878 --> 01:18:50.921
It's got your signature, Hilary Faye.

01:18:56.552 --> 01:18:57.620
Come on, Veronica. Let's go.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.929
Let me go!

01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:02.975
You are nothing but a big fake!

01:19:07.396 --> 01:19:09.064
I think you should go, Hilary.

01:19:12.067 --> 01:19:13.636
Step aside, please.

01:19:13.736 --> 01:19:15.346
- Hil...
- Get away from me!

01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:17.264
- You really should go now.
- You go!

01:19:17.364 --> 01:19:20.101
I designed these decorations here!

01:19:20.201 --> 01:19:22.228
And my father donated the refreshments!

01:19:22.328 --> 01:19:24.605
And I got Godflight onstage, okay?

01:19:24.705 --> 01:19:28.818
And I was just doing this
because Jesus told me to. He did!

01:19:28.918 --> 01:19:32.755
Now, you, get out of my way!
All of you, get out of my way!

01:19:52.316 --> 01:19:54.109
Get out of my way, you freaks!

01:20:16.382 --> 01:20:17.967
I'll go get Patrick and Mary.

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:24.890
What are you... What are you doing here?

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:28.018
I'm going to my prom.

01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:31.939
What, did Mercy House
let you just borrow the van?

01:20:35.526 --> 01:20:39.113
Not exactly. We sort of led a rebellion
and swiped it. You're pregnant?

01:20:40.656 --> 01:20:41.740
Look, I really...

01:20:43.284 --> 01:20:45.436
I wanted to tell you, but...

01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:47.621
On the first time?

01:20:48.622 --> 01:20:49.623
Yeah.

01:20:54.837 --> 01:20:56.338
That is so awesome.

01:20:57.798 --> 01:20:59.258
Yeah?

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.790
There's something I wanna tell you, too.

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:08.684
He's your life-partner, right?

01:21:11.228 --> 01:21:12.605
Prom date.

01:21:14.315 --> 01:21:15.774
It's really nice to see you.

01:21:17.776 --> 01:21:20.429
- Dean, this is Patrick.
- Nice to meet you.

01:21:20.529 --> 01:21:21.680
Excuse me, Mary.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:25.184
Listen, son, I suggest you
and your friends get back in the van,

01:21:25.284 --> 01:21:28.604
and back to Mercy House as quick
as you can before you're all arrested.

01:21:28.704 --> 01:21:30.940
We've had enough
excitement here for tonight.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.082
We're not leaving.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.736
What you and your friends have done
is not cool in the eyes of God.

01:21:35.836 --> 01:21:38.781
- Jesus, Dad, stop it.
- Patrick, this is not a gray area.

01:21:38.881 --> 01:21:42.076
- Dad, it's all a gray area.
- The Bible is black and white!

01:21:42.176 --> 01:21:46.330
- Stop it! Would you listen to yourself?
- I don't need this from you now.

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:47.873
We've been kicked out
of our homes and schools,

01:21:47.973 --> 01:21:49.375
and now we're gonna
be kicked out of Mercy House?

01:21:49.475 --> 01:21:51.018
There's nowhere left for us to go.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.104
I'm supposed to be here.

01:21:55.064 --> 01:21:57.508
This is my prom.
I wanna spend it with my friends.

01:21:57.608 --> 01:22:02.388
There's no room for moral ambiguity here.
The Bible is very clear about this.

01:22:02.488 --> 01:22:04.181
So everything that doesn't fit

01:22:04.281 --> 01:22:07.476
into some stupid idea
of what you think God wants

01:22:07.576 --> 01:22:10.871
you just try to hide or fix or get rid of?

01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:14.083
It's just all too much to live up to.

01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:19.088
No one fits in 100% of the time.

01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:22.007
Not even you.

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:23.993
I know that, Mary.

01:22:24.093 --> 01:22:28.998
I know in my heart
that Jesus still loves me.

01:22:29.098 --> 01:22:33.227
Why would God make us all so different...

01:22:34.144 --> 01:22:35.896
if he wanted us to be the same?

01:22:41.068 --> 01:22:42.403
Now what?

01:23:11.348 --> 01:23:14.059
Save the heathens, Hilary Faye.

01:23:16.478 --> 01:23:18.981
Be a warrior, Hilary Faye!

01:23:20.357 --> 01:23:23.110
Sacrifice everything, Hilary Faye!

01:23:28.824 --> 01:23:32.745
And here's your big, fat, stupid reward!

01:23:34.205 --> 01:23:35.206
Oh, my God.

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.919
- I think I'm feeling kind of woozy.
- What?

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:44.573
Somebody call an ambulance.

01:23:44.673 --> 01:23:47.092
That was so awesome, Hilary Faye!

01:23:54.558 --> 01:23:55.935
Jesus Christ!

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:23.320
- You okay?
- No, Roland.

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.784
I crashed my van into Jesus, okay?
I have a pimple the size of Jupiter!

01:24:28.884 --> 01:24:30.594
I am not okay!

01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:32.847
This is...

01:24:33.931 --> 01:24:37.184
not how I wanted to remember my prom.

01:24:39.103 --> 01:24:42.398
This is not how I wanted
to remember my life.

01:24:43.816 --> 01:24:45.401
Well, maybe we could fix it...

01:24:46.277 --> 01:24:48.387
with some glue or something.

01:24:48.487 --> 01:24:50.948
I am so sorry, Roland.

01:24:51.574 --> 01:24:54.034
I shouldn't have ratted you out
in front of everyone.

01:24:55.077 --> 01:24:57.663
I would have probably done the same thing.

01:24:59.623 --> 01:25:02.485
Do you think Jesus still loves me, Roland?

01:25:02.585 --> 01:25:04.128
Probably not.

01:25:07.882 --> 01:25:09.884
Yeah, sure.

01:25:12.344 --> 01:25:14.930
Hey, she's over here!

01:25:17.099 --> 01:25:19.351
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

01:25:21.979 --> 01:25:24.440
- Don't worry. I won't bite.
- Thank you.

01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:27.026
- It's gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

01:25:48.088 --> 01:25:49.448
I only got room for one of you.

01:25:49.548 --> 01:25:51.826
- I'm the father.
- I'm the boyfriend.

01:25:51.926 --> 01:25:53.369
I'm his boyfriend.

01:25:53.469 --> 01:25:55.788
That's nice, but I still
only got room for one of you.

01:25:55.888 --> 01:25:57.515
Starting the party without me?

01:25:58.474 --> 01:25:59.934
Are you okay?

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:05.231
You didn't ruin my life, Mary.

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.944
Breathe, baby. Good girl.

01:26:14.823 --> 01:26:16.058
Just keep breathing.

01:26:16.158 --> 01:26:18.953
Good girl. You're gonna be fine.

01:26:21.914 --> 01:26:25.067
Okay, I'm pretty sure
this isn't what Jesus had in mind

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:26.961
when he said, "Help Dean."

01:26:28.295 --> 01:26:29.989
Look, don't be too harsh.

01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:32.908
I'm not the first person
to ever get the message screwed up.

01:26:33.008 --> 01:26:34.301
She's perfect.

01:26:35.052 --> 01:26:39.373
Looking at her,
it's like life is too amazing

01:26:39.473 --> 01:26:43.269
to be this random and meaningless
consequence of the universe.

01:26:43.978 --> 01:26:45.755
There had to be a God...

01:26:45.855 --> 01:26:47.940
or something out there.

01:26:48.691 --> 01:26:50.426
Something inside.

01:26:50.526 --> 01:26:53.237
You just have to feel it.

01:26:55.739 --> 01:26:57.074
Do you want to hold her?

01:27:33.027 --> 01:27:34.695
Do you want to hold her, Dean?

01:27:45.873 --> 01:27:48.818
I mean, really, when you think about it...

01:27:48.918 --> 01:27:50.419
what would Jesus do?

01:27:51.587 --> 01:27:52.588
I don't know...

01:27:53.464 --> 01:27:58.427
but in the meantime we'll be trying
to figure it out... together.
