00:02.169 --> 00:03.502
- ANASTASIA: Alright,
let me blow them!

00:03.504 --> 00:05.938
- Okay blow them, go on.
- Okay, here we go.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.040
- REGINALD: Ha! Pay up!

00:08.042 --> 00:09.408
Your house is now foreclosed,

00:09.410 --> 00:12.811
my block is now
fully gentrified.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.179
- No it ain't.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.482
- Now it is,
you owe me $500,

00:16.484 --> 00:19.418
and here is your eviction
notice.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.822
- Alright.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.324
I would ask you to blow
on them,

00:25.326 --> 00:27.760
but I don't want bad luck so
here we go...

00:29.597 --> 00:31.397
- [everyone "ooh"s]

00:31.399 --> 00:33.198
- There you go.
Well, Reggie,

00:33.200 --> 00:36.035
you owe me a permit fee
to build on my property.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.504
- I'm gonna build a library.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.972
- You gonna build a library?

00:39.974 --> 00:41.373
Passing out free books?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.575
Oh, that's gonna make a lot of
money.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.146
- Shh.
I need silence before I blow.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.914
- That's what she said.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.585
- MR. BROWN: Come on, let's roll
it, whatever that meant.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.524
- Ah!
I now own a baseball team!

00:58.526 --> 01:02.761
- And I own the stadium.
Pay up.

01:02.763 --> 01:06.065
- Reggie, why you always think
you better than everybody?

01:06.067 --> 01:09.401
- I am.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.538
And it's Mr. Junie to you as
I just acquired

01:12.540 --> 01:16.308
the company you work for,
I am now your boss.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.043
- You know one day
you gonna regret

01:18.045 --> 01:21.880
just talking to me like that
when I'm independently wealthy.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.148
- Play! Just Play.
- Roll the dice!

01:23.150 --> 01:24.383
- Just give me my money.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.651
- MR. BROWN: Here,
I'ma pay you in ones.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.186
- No, no, no, no,
give me the real money--

01:27.188 --> 01:28.554
- No, you gotta take it
in ones!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.222
If you want to take it,
you gotta take it--

01:30.224 --> 01:32.124
- No, I want the real money!
- No, take it in ones!

01:32.126 --> 01:35.527
- Hey, hey guys!
Well, what's going on in here?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.897
- A game of Hoodopoly
gone bad.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.466
- You know what? Since you all
talking about money,

01:40.468 --> 01:42.267
let's talk about real money.

01:42.269 --> 01:46.505
There's a new community
initiative called Ark Tank.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.407
- Oh, Ark Tank?
- CORA: Yeah, yeah.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.075
- The show that come on TV?
- CORA: Mm-hmm.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.910
- What? That's my show!

01:51.912 --> 01:53.145
- Ark Tank, see the pamphlet.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.613
Right here, it says,

01:54.615 --> 01:57.249
"Ark Tank is a community
initiative to help seniors

01:57.251 --> 02:00.252
"use their imagination
to invent something

02:00.254 --> 02:01.720
to improve their community."

02:01.722 --> 02:03.655
Now wait, this the good part,
this the good part.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.692
"The winner receives
$10,000!"

02:06.694 --> 02:09.294
- MR. BROWN: What? $10,000?
- CORA: Yes.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.663
- MR. BROWN: I'm rich,
I'm winning it. I'm rich!

02:11.665 --> 02:14.299
- CORA: You know what, I think
we should do it as a team

02:14.301 --> 02:15.734
and we just split the money.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.871
- That's if old greedy here
wanna share.

02:18.873 --> 02:22.207
Ah, take the ones like
I told you. Take the ones.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.443
- EFE: You still want us to
do it as a team?

02:24.445 --> 02:25.677
- Nah, you gonna play it,

02:25.679 --> 02:27.012
I'm gonna play it the way
I want to.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.548

02:43.664 --> 02:47.165

02:47.167 --> 02:48.967
- What time you'd get
in last night?

02:48.969 --> 02:51.303
- Man time.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.105
- What's that supposed to mean?

02:53.107 --> 02:57.042
- It means I got home
when I got home.

02:57.044 --> 03:01.346
- Yeah right, we both have
a curfew and you know it.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.549
- Good morning.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.517
One of you have my
cell phone charger?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.819
I couldn't charge my phone
last night.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.154
- Uh, I have it.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.757
Sorry Mom, you were asleep
when I got in last night,

03:11.759 --> 03:13.559
and I didn't want to wake
you up.

03:13.561 --> 03:17.095
Then me and Dad started watching
Dumbest Criminals.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.064
- Wait, you watched TV
with Dad?

03:19.066 --> 03:20.432
- Yeah.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.734
- Do you know what time
he got home?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.703
- Yeah.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.142
- [door slams]

03:31.211 --> 03:33.512
- Kids,
am I right?

03:33.514 --> 03:38.717
- Boy, watch yourself.
Make your bed up.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.686
Grown man.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.592
- Dad?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.160
Dad?

03:48.162 --> 03:49.761
- Hey.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.931
- Is it just me or did I wake up
in The Twilight Zone?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.499
- What's up?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.301
- Did you watch a show
with Philip last night?

03:56.303 --> 03:58.837
- Yeah, it was funny as hell.
Oh my god.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.639
Yo, this dude tried to rob a
store

04:00.641 --> 04:03.709
with a brown bag over his head,
with no eye holes.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.944
Then he ran into the chip rack
and then the clerk

04:05.946 --> 04:07.813
came out of nowhere and drop
kicked him.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.481
It was hilarious!

04:09.483 --> 04:11.917
- Right. Do you know what
time he got home?

04:11.919 --> 04:15.887
- Uh, he brought me a salted
caramel funnel cake

04:15.889 --> 04:17.956
when he got home,
I remember that.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.692
- Okay, so you do know he was
late coming home, right?

04:20.694 --> 04:23.095
- Yeah.
- SANDRA: Did he call first?

04:23.097 --> 04:25.163
- Mm-mm.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.865
- What?

04:26.867 --> 04:29.968
When I came home late last
month, I was grounded for weeks.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.303
- Yeah, that's different.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.704
- Okay, how so?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.339
- Because you're a girl.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.775
- And?
I'm older.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.877
- Look, it don't matter,
alright?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.612
- So you let Philip stay out
later than me

04:40.614 --> 04:42.581
because he's a boy?

04:42.583 --> 04:45.550
- Yes, you are a girl,
and you are more fragile

04:45.552 --> 04:47.653
and vulnerable.
You are my daughter,

04:47.655 --> 04:49.521
and I'm not letting anything
happen to you out there.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.023
I don't want you to get hurt.

04:51.025 --> 04:55.927
- That is so unfair.
- ANASTASIA: It is.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.932
- I'm responsible.
- Independent.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.868
- Wise.
- Mature.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.469
- So why is this happening
to me?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.705
- Something called chauvinism.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.874
But your dad loves you, darling.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.543
- Yeah, well, he obviously
loves Philip more.

05:11.545 --> 05:16.548
- Look, no, sometimes when
things are unfair,

05:16.550 --> 05:18.750
you have to make them so.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.586
- Well, how am I supposed
to do that?

05:21.588 --> 05:25.290
- I think I might have something
in mind that can work.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.893
Have you ever heard of
Ida B. Wells?

05:27.895 --> 05:31.530
- Isn't she that reality star
on How to Box a Kangaroo?

05:31.532 --> 05:34.733
- No, darling.
We have much to talk about.

05:34.735 --> 05:39.938
- ♪

05:39.940 --> 05:42.474
- Okay, I'ma let all y'all
have the shine,

05:42.476 --> 05:45.544
I'm not gonna participate.
- Good idea.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.947
- Yeah, I'm a coach.
- Bad idea.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.950
- I have you to know I've
been coaching for years,

05:51.952 --> 05:53.385
and I'm undefeated.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.087
- Like what, fool?

05:55.089 --> 05:59.991
- My female chess team,
they won the triple-D cup.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.227
- Let us get started.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.962
- Okay, okay--
- CORA: Thank you.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.964
- What we gonna do is,
y'all throw out ideas,

06:05.966 --> 06:07.766
and then I'ma vote them
up or down.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.568
I'm the coach, okay?
Thank you.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.303
- CORA: And I'ma
write 'em down.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.704
- MR. BROWN: Yeah, you Cora,
you write them down.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.139
Okay--
- I'll go first.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.640
- You go first, yeah.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.312
- Wrinkle water.

06:20.314 --> 06:26.017
With each drop,
the wrinkles stop.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.386
- That would have to be
lab tested,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.590
no time for that.
Next.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.625
- MR. BROWN: Wrinkle water.
Reggie, let me,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.761
I vote stuff up or down,
I'm the coach.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.563
I vote up or down.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.832
Anastasia, that was such a ...

06:40.834 --> 06:45.203
Oh, that idea, girl,
however stupid it was!

06:45.205 --> 06:47.038
Have a seat.
Next!

06:47.040 --> 06:50.175
- I have an idea.
- MR. BROWN: Mm-hmm.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.011
- Pan-African Eats.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.647
It is a drone service that
takes hot meals

06:55.649 --> 06:59.417
from local restaurants to
Africa in 24 hours.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.319
- MR. BROWN: Hey!

07:01.321 --> 07:03.255
Okay, so food from Africa?
- Mm-hmm

07:03.257 --> 07:04.756
- MR. BROWN: To America?
- Yes.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.658
- MR. BROWN: Over the water?
- Uh-huh.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.493
- It's gonna be hot
and it's gonna get colder?

07:08.495 --> 07:10.228
- Ah, yes now.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.732
- Boy, don't nobody want no
order of salmonella, sit down.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.767
You'll kill somebody!
- VINNY: It's kinda stupid.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.037
I've got a great idea.
- MR. BROWN: Okay.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.807
- How about this?
Love lotion!

07:21.809 --> 07:25.010
You put it all over your body
when you making love.

07:25.012 --> 07:29.147
Get this.
Smell like collard greens.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.716
- I am not writing that down,
Mr. Vinny.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.520
- You always hungry when
you finish making love.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.656
- Vinny stop being nasty,
what kind of lotion

07:37.658 --> 07:39.424
gonna do that?

07:39.426 --> 07:41.726
- This is ridiculous.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.663
- Reginald, what did you have in
mind?

07:44.665 --> 07:49.501
- Well, it has to be something
practical,

07:49.503 --> 07:52.470
like The Clapper.
- [claps hands]

07:52.472 --> 07:54.206
- That's already been invented.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.440
- Well, wait a minute now,

07:55.442 --> 07:58.276
depends on what you wanna
be clapping.

07:59.246 --> 08:03.248
- What about a 24-hour
burial service?

08:03.250 --> 08:08.687
We bury your dead
by the time you get to bed.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.889
- How do we make money from
that?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.625
- Well, people dying as
they ain't never died before.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.960
- That's true.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.295
Oh! I say we charge a
subscription fee.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.930
- That's a good idea.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.567
- We charge them $12 a month,
on a thirty-year contract.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.270
- Bad idea.
Who's gonna pay?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.906
The people are already dead.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.943
- What about a $20
visitor's fee?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.478
- Hmm.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.080
- That's stupid,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.915
don't nobody visit you when you
done dead. That's just...

08:36.917 --> 08:39.584
- And it takes a week
to embalm you.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.219
- Not at our funeral service,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.089
where we put some, some,
flat fixer in you,

08:44.091 --> 08:49.628
boom, hit it,
swell you right on up.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.997
- Were you born with fool genes?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.032
- Okay, you're not gonna talk to
your coach like,

08:54.034 --> 08:56.468
'cause I can vote your idea
up or down.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.969
Which one you want it?
Up or down?

08:57.971 --> 09:01.139
- I will not be part
of a half-baked idea,

09:01.141 --> 09:03.642
I think it's best that I
go this alone.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.710
- Well go, fine.
Do what you're gonna do.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.212
May the best man win.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.481
- Good luck coaching the
Bad News Bears.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.916
- My people come up with
anything

09:10.918 --> 09:12.150
you can come up with,
Mr. Smarts.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.822
- The table is set?
- Yep, I got it Cora, check.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.457
- Okay, the community judge
should be here any minute.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.792
- Okay, who judging?

09:20.794 --> 09:21.960
- Don't worry about it,
Mr. Brown.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.095
- Oh.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.599
You look excited to be here.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.402
- What is this? Jury duty.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.337
Couldn't come up with a good
enough excuse to decline,

09:32.339 --> 09:35.907
so now you're gonna shove this
down my throat?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.777
- Well, it's always good
to see you, too.
