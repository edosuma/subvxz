00:13.041 --> 00:14.625
OOH, THE RICE IS LOOKING
KINDA GUMMY, PACE.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.041
UH, NO.
IT'S RISOTTO, JO,

00:16.041 --> 00:17.834
AND IT'S NOT GUMMY.
IT'S JUST ABSORBING
THE STUFF.

00:17.834 --> 00:20.625
JOEY, PLEASE DON'T
HINDER THE MAN'S PROCESS,
ALL RIGHT? I'M STARVING.

00:20.625 --> 00:23.458
YEAH, ME, TOO. WHAT GIVES
WITH THE FANCY RICE?

00:23.458 --> 00:26.125
IT'S RISOTTO, AND IT
CAN'T JUST BE COOKED.
IT HAS TO BE BUILT.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.625
WELL, THAT'S AWESOME
AND EVERYTHING,

00:27.625 --> 00:28.834
BUT IF THE PLAN
IS FOR US TO BOND,

00:28.834 --> 00:31.667
LET'S JUST ORDER A PIZZA
AND GIVE EACH OTHER MANICURES.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.166
AUDREY, ASIDE FROM
THE FACT THAT WE SAID

00:33.166 --> 00:35.458
THAT WE WOULD HAVE
THESE WEEKLY DINNERS

00:35.458 --> 00:37.000
AND HAVE OBVIOUSLY
FAILED TO DO SO,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.333
PACEY'S COOKING,
ON HIS NIGHT OFF, NO LESS.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.333
I MEAN, WE SHOULD
AT LEAST WELCOME THE BREAK
FROM DINING HALL FARE.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.041
YEAH, WELL,
YOU PROMISED ME A GRAMS,

00:43.041 --> 00:45.291
AND I SEE NO GRAMS,
SO THE EVENING
IS CLEARLY RUINED.

00:45.291 --> 00:46.083
I'M LIKING THE DECOR,
HOWEVER.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.250
HEY, YOU GUYS
EVER GO CRAZY

00:48.250 --> 00:49.708
AND EAT OFF THE PLATES
ON THE WALL?

00:49.708 --> 00:51.542
Pacey: HEY, AUDREY,
YOU KNOW THAT ONION
I ASKED YOU TO CHOP?

00:51.542 --> 00:53.458
YES. YES, I DO.
FORK IT OVER.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.291
OH, NO. I'M SORRY.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.041
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST TRYING

00:55.041 --> 00:56.000
TO MAKE ME
FEEL INCLUDED

00:56.000 --> 00:58.542
BY GIVING ME
A LITTLE TASK TO DO.

00:58.542 --> 00:59.542
I DIDN'T...

00:59.542 --> 01:00.792
HERE, PACE.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.333
SO, WHERE ARE
JEN AND DAWSON?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.708
I THOUGHT THE FESTIVAL
ENDED YESTERDAY.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.792
YEAH, JEN CALLED GRAMS,
SAID THEY WERE STAYIN'
AN EXTRA DAY.

01:10.792 --> 01:14.708

YOU MOCK ME.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.417
I DO MOCK YOU.

01:33.417 --> 01:38.750
OH, I JUST ENJOYED
OUR LITTLE ESCAPIST
ADVENTURE. I MEAN...

01:38.750 --> 01:40.417
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY TO HER.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.125
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

01:45.083 --> 01:49.500
ARE YOU PROPOSING
THAT WE SNEAK AROUND,
DAWSON LEERY? BECAUSE...

01:49.500 --> 01:52.250
YOU KNOW, I AM
THAT KIND OF GIRL.

01:52.250 --> 01:56.417
I AM PROPOSING
THAT WE JUST...

01:56.417 --> 01:57.917
ENJOY WHAT
WE HAVE GOIN' ON

01:57.917 --> 01:59.750

TO SERVE IT RIGHT AWAY

04:17.750 --> 04:19.333

A CHANCE TO COAGULATE.

04:19.333 --> 04:22.041

THAT'S PROBABLY OUR...

04:22.041 --> 04:23.750

THAT EVERYBODY
WAS GONNA BE HERE AND--

04:26.250 --> 04:27.250
OR THAT PACEY
WAS COOKING.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.250
RIGHT. WHO COULD
HAVE GUESSED?

EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

TO CAUSE A SCENE.

ARE YOU OK?

05:09.625 --> 05:15.291

A FUN WEEKEND TOGETHER.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.583
THEY WERE KISSING,
AND BELIEVE ME,

05:17.583 --> 05:19.375

I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.

OH! YES, RIGHT!

05:20.875 --> 05:21.792

05:21.792 --> 05:24.208
THIS ISN'T, LIKE,
FIRST WEEK AUDREY

05:24.208 --> 05:25.625
THAT YOU'RE
TALKING TO HERE.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.000
THIS IS DECEMBER AUDREY.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.291
I AM WISE. I'VE BEEN
STUDYING YOUR PEOPLE

05:30.291 --> 05:31.625
FOR A GREAT MANY MONTHS,
AND I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

05:31.625 --> 05:35.500
AND ALSO, I KNOW A THING
OR 2 ABOUT THE CASUAL KISS,

05:35.500 --> 05:39.333
AND I'M SORRY, BUT THAT KISS
LOOKED DECIDEDLY UN-CASUAL.

05:39.333 --> 05:43.834
HONEY, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE JUST THIS
NICE COUNTRY GIRL

05:43.834 --> 05:46.208
WHO GREW UP ON A STREAM,
OR WHATEVER,

05:46.208 --> 05:49.041
BUT DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.208
I'M SORRY. UH, WHAT'S
THE TOPIC AT HAND?

05:53.208 --> 05:55.792

RELATIONS WERE HAD.

SCANTILY CLAD AND POSSIBLY
FULLY NAKED RELATIONS?

OH, THANK YOU
FOR THAT IMAGE.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.000
I'M SORRY.
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

06:02.000 --> 06:03.500
YOU NEED A LITTLE
SLAP IN THE FACE.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.834
COME ON, WOMAN.
A REACTION, PLEASE.

06:05.834 --> 06:06.834
I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

06:06.834 --> 06:09.083
BUT I DON'T
HAVE A REACTION.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.000
I'M GONNA GO
SEE IF THERE'S

06:10.000 --> 06:11.083
SOMETHING
THAT I CAN
DO TO HELP.

06:11.083 --> 06:11.667
I'LL JUST
BE RIGHT BACK.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.667
OK.
OK.

DID YOU CHOOSE

06:51.792 --> 06:53.041

AT THE HEARTSTRINGS

OF REHABILITATED REBELS
AND FRAT BOYS ALIKE,

07:01.291 --> 07:04.000
AND HERE YOU ARE
NOT SHARING THE DETAILS?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.083
I GOT NOTHIN' TO SHARE.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.417
REALLY? SO THAT'S
WHY YOU'VE BEEN

07:07.417 --> 07:08.667
STARING
AT THE BATHROOM DOOR

07:08.667 --> 07:10.417
LIKE YOU WISH YOU HAD
TELEKINETIC POWERS,

07:10.417 --> 07:12.417
WHICH MEANS
TO ME THAT EITHER

07:12.417 --> 07:13.583
YOU ARE VERY, VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT AUDREY'S WARDROBE,

07:13.583 --> 07:17.917
OR PERHAPS YOU'RE
CONCERNED ABOUT JOEY.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.417
HEY, CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT I DON'T THINK

07:20.417 --> 07:23.000
JOEY'S GONNA MIND
A LITTLE KISSING,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.875
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

07:24.875 --> 07:26.875
SOMETHING
MORE HAPPENED.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.542

AN INTERESTING IDEA,

GONNA GO OVER
THE BASES WITH YA.

DID YOU SAY BASES?

NEED DETAILS.

HE WASN'T PREPARED.

08:05.792 --> 08:09.792
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET A CHANCE
TO HAVE THE TALK.

08:09.792 --> 08:10.792
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:10.792 --> 08:13.291

HIM AS IT IS HER.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.333

SICK AS IT SOUNDS,

08:15.333 --> 08:16.625
OH, MAN.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.625

08:33.500 --> 08:35.625
YOU KNOW, SEEING YOU
KISS SOMEONE ELSE

08:35.625 --> 08:36.833
IS ALWAYS GOING
TO BE A LITTLE WEIRD.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.166
I WON'T LIE, BUT...

08:40.041 --> 08:42.041
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE,

BACK TOGETHER.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.542

08:44.542 --> 08:47.000
I HADN'T THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.166
THE, UH, THE "BACK
TOGETHER" PART.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.000
I MEAN, WE'RE SUCH
DIFFERENT PEOPLE NOW.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.166
I GUESS
WE ALL ARE, I HOPE.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.417
YEAH.

09:04.708 --> 09:05.083
SO HOW DID THIS...

09:05.083 --> 09:07.875
HAPPEN?

09:07.875 --> 09:10.250
I DON'T KNOW.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.166
IT--IT KINDA TOOK US
BOTH BY SURPRISE.

OUT OF MY HEAD.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.708
AND--AND EVERYBODY
WAS SO ACCEPTING
OF THE FILM.

09:20.708 --> 09:24.708
AND, UH,
AS STUPID AS IT IS,

09:24.708 --> 09:26.291
THEY PUT US IN
THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.834
UM...

09:29.834 --> 09:32.000
AH, THERE'S
NO HANDBOOK
FOR THIS, IS THERE?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.917
NO. MAYBE WE SHOULD
THINK OF CO-AUTHORING ONE.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.375
UM...

09:40.208 --> 09:42.250
THERE'S NO GRACEFUL
WAY OF HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.542
WHAT CONVERSATION?

09:43.542 --> 09:46.708
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A KISS.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.959
OH.

09:59.375 --> 10:02.792
UH...
[LAUGHS]

10:02.792 --> 10:04.500
NO, THIS IS--
THIS IS KIND OF SILLY.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.333
UM, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
I--I MEAN, WHEN YOU TWO
WALKED IN THE DOOR TOGETHER,

10:08.333 --> 10:11.125
I MEAN, I'M THE LAST
PERSON IN THE WORLD
YOU COULD CALL NAIVE.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.792
JOEY.
NO, REALLY.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.792
I GET IT, OK?

10:14.792 --> 10:18.875
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE THIS INTO A THING.

10:18.875 --> 10:23.667
IN FACT, LET'S NOT
MAKE THIS INTO A THING, OK?

10:33.125 --> 10:35.875
HMM.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.583
WELL, I HATE TO BREAK
THIS TO YOU GUYS

10:40.583 --> 10:42.583
GIVEN YOUR OBVIOUS
LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM,

10:42.583 --> 10:44.417
BUT NOW, IT'S TIME
FOR THE SECOND COURSE.

10:44.417 --> 10:45.667
Joey:
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACE?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.500
IF THIS COOKING IS
STRESSING YOU OUT,

10:47.500 --> 10:51.291
AND WE'RE ALL TIRED
FROM WHATEVER,
I MEAN...

10:51.291 --> 10:52.667
WE COULD CALL THIS
OFF IF YOU WANT.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.208
[CHUCKLES]
OH, NO.

10:54.208 --> 10:55.417
IT'S A GOOD TRY, BUT NO,

10:55.417 --> 10:57.458
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY
MORE COURSES TO COME,

10:57.458 --> 10:58.875
AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY
NOT BE UP TO SNUFF

10:58.875 --> 11:00.792
FOR FINICKY SORTS
SUCH AS YOURSELF,

11:00.792 --> 11:02.291
I PUT A LOT OF TIME
AND ENERGY INTO THEM,

11:02.291 --> 11:04.458
SO THAT HAS TO BE
WORTH SOMETHING, RIGHT?

11:04.458 --> 11:07.667
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.208
NO, NO.
I'LL BE FINE.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.333
IF YOU CAN MAKE
ANY SENSE OF THAT.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.917
MAN.

11:51.917 --> 11:55.166
LAST WEEK,
SHE TOLD ME THAT, UM...

11:55.166 --> 11:56.875
SHE COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYBODY BETTER

11:56.875 --> 12:00.458
TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU THAN ME.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.208
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND.

12:02.208 --> 12:07.291
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
AND CARE ABOUT THOSE
PEOPLE IN THE NEXT ROOM,

12:07.291 --> 12:07.875
I'M HAPPY WITH YOU.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.125
OK?

12:12.125 --> 12:15.125
AND NOBODY ELSE GETS
TO WEIGH IN ON THAT.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.875
OK?
OK.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.291
LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA
SAY IT, ALL RIGHT?

12:27.291 --> 12:28.959
I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

12:28.959 --> 12:30.417
Joey: REALLY? I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE ALL FOR

12:30.417 --> 12:32.083

LOOK, COME ON, GUYS.
SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA SAY IT.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.125
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S THE BEST TIME

12:39.125 --> 12:41.417
TO EXPERIMENT FOR
EITHER ONE OF THEM.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.708
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE
GLAD I SAID THAT?

12:42.708 --> 12:43.583
OK, OK.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.250
BUT SERIOUSLY,
WHERE'S THE GRAMS?

12:46.250 --> 12:47.750

EVADING THE QUESTION
ALL NIGHT.

AUDREY'S RIGHT.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.917
IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE
TO BE DOING THIS

13:02.834 --> 13:05.375
OK, LOOK, I KNOW THAT
LEAVING RIGHT NOW
SOUNDS TEMPTING,

13:05.375 --> 13:06.500
AND IT WOULD BE EASY,

13:06.500 --> 13:07.875
BUT SOMEHOW
I DON'T THINK THAT

13:07.875 --> 13:11.375
THE EASY THING
IS GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING
IN THE LONG RUN.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.875

14:15.375 --> 14:18.708
I DIDN'T
PLAN ON THIS.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.708
I DIDN'T ASSUME
THAT YOU DID.

BEEN BETWEEN US

YOU AND I WERE
FINALLY GETTING CLOSE.

14:37.542 --> 14:38.708
AND I WOULD JUST--

14:38.708 --> 14:41.417

GOING TO BE APOCALYPTIC.

I DID SERVE YOU

JUST GETTING THROUGH THE DAY

16:05.667 --> 16:06.750

KIND OF APPEALING.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.250
BUT, UH,
NORA AND I...AREN'T.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.083
THAT'S GREAT.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.875
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU...

21:17.875 --> 21:20.291
ARE?

21:23.125 --> 21:25.542
HIS NAME'S DAWSON.

21:25.542 --> 21:26.625
AND I WOULD HAVE
INTRODUCED YOU GUYS

21:26.625 --> 21:28.458
IF IT WEREN'T ONE
OF THE MORE AWKWARD

21:28.458 --> 21:30.083
MEET AND GREETS
KNOWN TO MAN.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.291
YEAH.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.625
NOT THAT THIS SERVES
AS AN ABSOLUTION,

21:34.625 --> 21:39.166
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE
A HABIT OF PICKING
THE WRONG GUY, AND--

21:39.166 --> 21:44.333
AND I FEEL LIKE MAYBE
THIS TIME I MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

21:45.834 --> 21:49.208
WELL, I HONESTLY JUST
WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY, JEN.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.041
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.625
I AM.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.583
I HOPE TO SEE YOU
AROUND SOMETIME.

22:00.458 --> 22:00.959
SURE.

22:00.959 --> 22:03.625
FROM AFAR.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.500
AT GRADUATION.

22:07.375 --> 22:08.500
WELL, TAKE CARE.

22:11.375 --> 22:11.583
BYE.

22:18.208 --> 22:19.458
SORRY, YOU GUYS.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.792
Dawson: EVERYTHING OK?

22:20.792 --> 22:23.166
YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.500
T-SHIRT RETURNED.
CASE CLOSED.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.542
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET
SOME MORE SALAD.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.500
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:52.875 --> 22:55.834
YOU KNOW, UH,
WE NEED TO, UH,
CHANGE THE MUSIC.

22:55.834 --> 22:56.542
JEN?

22:58.834 --> 23:00.583
EXCUSE ME, I GUESS.

23:05.708 --> 23:08.458
THERE. HOW'S THAT?
YOU HAPPY NOW?

23:08.458 --> 23:10.291
NO, NOT REALLY.

23:10.291 --> 23:11.583
WHAT? DO YOU THINK
IT'S TOO POPPY?

23:11.583 --> 23:12.875
LOOK. LOOK.
CAN WE JUST PRETEND

23:12.875 --> 23:13.375
THAT WE'RE
BEST FRIENDS HERE
FOR A MINUTE?

23:13.375 --> 23:15.166
ALL RIGHT?

23:15.166 --> 23:16.708
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH DAWSON.

23:16.708 --> 23:17.875
I MEAN, COME ON,
ANY STEPS YOU WANNA
FILL ME IN ON HERE?

23:17.875 --> 23:21.125
NO.

23:21.125 --> 23:25.875
NO, NO STEPS REALLY,
I JUST...

23:25.875 --> 23:27.708
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST HAPPENED, JACK.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.458
AND I WISH YOU COULD
UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:29.458 --> 23:32.208
OH, LOOK. LOOK.
I UNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT?

23:32.208 --> 23:33.333
I MEAN, I'M CLOSE ENOUGH
TO BOTH OF YOU TO KNOW

23:33.333 --> 23:35.583
THAT EVEN WHEN
YOU GUYS WERE PLATONIC,

23:35.583 --> 23:38.041
YOU WERE PUTTING
YOURSELF UP ON THIS
FIRST LOVE PEDESTAL,

23:38.041 --> 23:40.333
BUT, JEN, COME ON.
THE GUY'S FATHER
JUST DIED.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.875
HE'S JUST TRYING TO
PIECE TOGETHER HOW TO
GET ALONG WITH HIS LIFE,

23:41.875 --> 23:44.375
LET ALONE HIS LOVE LIFE,
AND YOU--

23:44.375 --> 23:45.750
YOU JUST STOPPED
GOING WITH CHARLIE,
WHAT, A WEEK AGO?

23:47.083 --> 23:49.417
IS THIS ABOUT CHARLIE?

23:49.417 --> 23:52.083
BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO TELL YOU

23:52.083 --> 23:53.625
ON HOW MANY LEVELS WE'RE OVER.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.083
NO, THIS IS NOT ABOUT
CHARLIE. ALL RIGHT?
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.375
I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AWARE

23:56.375 --> 23:57.875
OF HOW DELICATE
THIS LITTLE SCENARIO IS,
THAT'S ALL.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.792
[SIGHS]

23:59.792 --> 24:04.500
I AM PERFECTLY AWARE
OF HOW DELICATE THIS...

24:04.500 --> 24:06.583
I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU
CALL MY RELATIONSHIP,

24:06.583 --> 24:08.959
LITTLE SCENARIO, IS?

24:08.959 --> 24:11.625
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK
THAT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE KITCHEN RIGHT NOW

24:11.625 --> 24:13.792
DOESN'T EFFECT ME,
YOU'RE WRONG, BECAUSE IT DOES.

24:13.792 --> 24:17.333
ALL THE MORE INDICATION
THAT MAYBE IT'S
A LITTLE TOO SOON.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.625
TOO SOON FOR WHAT?

24:19.625 --> 24:20.417
DAWSON AND I ARE JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

24:20.417 --> 24:22.792
WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN US.

24:24.792 --> 24:26.625
WHICH WOULD BE
A LOT EASIER HAD WE NOT

24:26.625 --> 24:29.125
COME HOME TO THIS LOVELY
LITTLE INTERVENTION.

24:29.125 --> 24:32.166
OH, COME ON, JEN.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE
PLANNED IT LIKE THAT.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.375
IT'S A DINNER,
NOT AN INTERVENTION.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.667
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE IT.

24:40.166 --> 24:43.625
I GOTTA ASK,

24:43.625 --> 24:45.041
LIKE, WHO ARE YOU TO TALK?

24:46.375 --> 24:48.542
BECAUSE YOU'VE CONVENIENTLY
ERASED YOURSELF FROM MY LIFE

24:48.542 --> 24:49.834
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.417
WELL, THAT'S
A 2-WAY STREET, JEN.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.750
YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY
BEEN REACHING OUT
TO ME, EITHER.

24:52.750 --> 24:56.166
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
I FIND IT DIFFICULT

24:56.166 --> 24:58.083
TO HAVE A HEART-TO-HEART
WITH A GUY

24:58.083 --> 24:59.000
WHO WOULD CHOOSE A BEER BONG
OVER HIS BOYFRIEND.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.375
OH, YEAH?

25:01.375 --> 25:02.500
WELL, MAYBE
I DON'T WANNA BOTHER

25:02.500 --> 25:03.708
TRYING TO EXPLAIN
TO SOMEONE

25:03.708 --> 25:05.417
WHO'S ALREADY MADE UP
HER MIND ABOUT ME.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.500
GOOD, THEN YOU SHOULD
KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.792
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN ME
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS

25:12.792 --> 25:15.542
IF YOU THINK THAT I'M
CAPABLE OF HURTING DAWSON.

25:17.041 --> 25:18.333
HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT?

25:18.333 --> 25:19.625
OH, I DON'T KNOW, JEN.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.667
HOW CAN YOU WRITE
YOUR BEST FRIEND OFF

25:21.667 --> 25:24.792
AS A 2-DIMENSIONAL,
BEER-GUZZLING FRAT BOY?

25:26.250 --> 25:28.041
IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT
EVEN THAT ANYMORE.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.834
AND IT'S NOT DAWSON, IS IT?

25:32.125 --> 25:35.083
YOU AND I USED TO OPERATE
LIKE THIS PERFECT CLOCKWORK.

25:39.583 --> 25:41.458
YOU KNEW HOW
I TOOK MY COFFEE,

25:41.458 --> 25:43.583
I KNEW HOW
YOU LIKED YOUR TOAST.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.083
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE PEOPLE?

25:59.375 --> 26:01.708
LOOK, I'M JUST AS HAPPY
LIVING IN DENIAL
AS THE NEXT GUY,

26:01.708 --> 26:04.333
BUT, REALLY,
IS THE FOOD THAT BAD?

26:04.333 --> 26:07.041
ALL IN ALL, I TOTALLY
GIVE YOU KUDOS

26:07.041 --> 26:08.417
FOR KEEPING IT
TOGETHER TONIGHT.

26:08.417 --> 26:11.333
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE, TOO,

26:11.333 --> 26:13.542
BECAUSE, SYMPATHETIC
AS I AM TO THE DRAMA
AND WHATNOT,

26:13.542 --> 26:15.125
IT IS NICE TO LOOK
ACROSS THE TABLE

26:15.125 --> 26:17.291
AND SEE A PAIR OF EYES
WHO'S NOT REALLY READY
TO KILL HERSELF

26:17.291 --> 26:18.041
OR THE PERSON SITTING
DIRECTLY TO HER RIGHT.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.291
HMM.

26:21.583 --> 26:23.667
OK.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.333
TO NOT HATING EACH OTHER.

26:26.375 --> 26:27.583
CHEERS.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.583
YOU KNOW, IF GRAMS
EVER DOES GET HOME,

26:41.583 --> 26:43.041
SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE TOO PLEASED

26:43.041 --> 26:43.917
TO FIND OUT YOU'VE
RUBBED THE PATTERN
OFF HER BOWL.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.750
JOEY, I REALLY
APPRECIATE WHATEVER
REASONS YOU HAVE

26:49.750 --> 26:50.875
FOR PRETENDING
YOU'RE FINE,

26:50.875 --> 26:52.125
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT WITH ME.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.000
DO YOU MISS ME?

26:57.291 --> 26:59.917
DO YOU MISS BEING AROUND ME?

26:59.917 --> 27:02.000
YES.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.375
JOEY, OF COURSE
I MISS BEING
AROUND YOU.

27:07.458 --> 27:10.083
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

27:10.083 --> 27:14.125
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT SCHOOL AND MOVING,

27:14.125 --> 27:18.417
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

27:18.417 --> 27:20.834
I MEAN, OUR LIVES USED
TO HAPPEN TOGETHER, DAWSON.

27:23.291 --> 27:26.750
I THINK SOME PART OF YOU
WON'T FORGIVE ME FOR
CHANGING THE FUTURE.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.041
NO. NO, JO,
I CHANGED THE FUTURE.

27:29.041 --> 27:29.458
I STAYED.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.291
FOR WHAT?

27:33.542 --> 27:34.875
YOU KNOW FOR WHAT.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.792
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

27:37.792 --> 27:42.125
DAWSON, HOW DID I GO
FROM BEING ON THE CORNER
OF POSSIBILITY

27:42.125 --> 27:43.542
TO BEING NOTHING AT ALL.

27:43.542 --> 27:44.875
YOU'RE NOT NOTHING
AT ALL, JOEY.

27:44.875 --> 27:49.041
YOU'RE THE FURTHEST THING
FROM NOTHING, OK?

27:49.041 --> 27:51.208
AND I WISH--

27:51.208 --> 27:53.667
I WISH I COULD
GIVE YOU AN EXPLANATION.
YOU DESERVE ONE.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.667
I DON'T--

27:55.667 --> 27:58.500
DAWSON, I DON'T WANT ONE
BECAUSE I DESERVE IT.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.625
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TREAT ME

27:59.625 --> 28:03.291
HOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.
I JUST...

28:03.291 --> 28:05.166
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TELL ME.

28:06.166 --> 28:09.333
SOMETHING SHIFTED
WHEN MY FATHER DIED.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.125
SOMETHING WAS LOST.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.750
AND, UH, PART OF ME,

28:15.750 --> 28:18.917
THE PART OF ME
THAT WAS STILL HOPEFUL

28:18.917 --> 28:20.959
JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU AND I COULD BE ON HOLD.

28:20.959 --> 28:23.667
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

28:23.667 --> 28:25.417
THIS PATH THAT I WAS ON,

28:25.417 --> 28:26.583
THAT SEEMED LIKE
SUCH A GREAT IDEA
WHEN I STARTED IT,

28:26.583 --> 28:28.000
JUST STOPPED MAKING SENSE.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.375
AND THE MORE I TRIED
TO STICK TO MY ROUTINE,

28:31.375 --> 28:32.834
THE HARDER IT WAS TO BREATHE.

28:36.959 --> 28:39.500
AND THEN WHEN JEN
AND I GOT OUT OF TOWN,
IT WAS...

28:42.417 --> 28:42.875
IT WAS LIKE STARTING OVER.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.792
DO YOU THINK THAT
THINGS WOULD HAVE
BEEN ANY DIFFERENT

28:47.792 --> 28:51.458
IF MAYBE I HAD
GONE WITH YOU?

28:53.250 --> 28:56.208
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.

28:56.208 --> 29:00.166
ALL I KNOW IS
WHEN I WAS WITH JEN,

29:00.166 --> 29:01.208
I FELT LIKE ME.

29:01.208 --> 29:03.375
YOU KNOW, NOT THE CENSORED
VERSION OF MYSELF,

29:03.375 --> 29:04.834
NOT THE SAD VERSION
OF MYSELF, JUST ME.

29:04.834 --> 29:07.375
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.458
AND IT--IT...

29:09.458 --> 29:09.959
IT FELT GOOD.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.417
AND YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU CAN'T BE YOURSELF
AROUND ME.

29:15.417 --> 29:17.125
JOEY, YOU'RE JUST HEARING
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

29:17.125 --> 29:20.125
NO, I THINK I'M
HEARING WHAT YOU'RE
AFRAID TO TELL ME.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.542
JOEY, IT HURTS
TO BE AROUND YOU.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.417
WHEN I SEE YOU,
EVEN FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,

29:32.417 --> 29:33.834
IT BRINGS UP
A THOUSAND MEMORIES.

29:33.834 --> 29:36.083
NOT JUST OF US,
BUT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE BEFORE.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.959
IT'S LIKE I'M FROZEN IN THIS
PLACE THAT I CAN'T BEAR TO BE.

29:39.959 --> 29:43.125
I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.834
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS
COME BACK TO YOU.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.500
I MEAN, EVEN NO MATTER
WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN US.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.083
EVEN THE THOUGHT OF YOU
IS AT LEAST A CONSTANT
COMFORT, BUT...

29:51.750 --> 29:56.375
I CAN'T GO BACK.
IT JUST HURTS.

30:03.917 --> 30:06.708
PACE, THIS LOOKS AMAZING.

30:06.708 --> 30:10.166
YEAH. WHO DELIVERED IT, HUH?

30:11.166 --> 30:12.291
SAY WHAT YOU WILL,

30:12.291 --> 30:13.625
NOT THAT I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT.

30:13.625 --> 30:16.500
BUT THIS ONE MIGHT ACTUALLY
ERR ON THE SIDE OF EDIBLE.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.792
SO, PLEASE DO TRY IT.

30:19.583 --> 30:20.792
THANKS.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.291
THIS IS REALLY GOOD, PACE.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.750
Joey:
IS THIS ESPRESSO
IN THE CENTER?

30:28.750 --> 30:29.917
Pacey: IT IS INDEED.

30:29.917 --> 30:30.792
DELIVERED FRESH
FROM MY KITCHEN
TO YOUR VEINS

30:30.792 --> 30:33.083
FOR A NIGHT
OF WAKEFUL STUDIES.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.417
MM, VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE,
PACEY.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.458
THANK YOU.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.291
GOOD TO KNOW THAT I
SALVAGED SOMETHING,

30:38.291 --> 30:39.750
THOUGH I PROMISE THAT
NEXT TIME WE DO THIS,

30:39.750 --> 30:41.000
IT WILL BE MUCH,
MUCH EASIER.

30:41.000 --> 30:41.959
NEXT TIME?

30:41.959 --> 30:43.417
OH, YEAH.
WE CAN'T QUIT NOW.

30:43.417 --> 30:44.500
YOU DON'T STOP RIDING
A BIKE

30:44.500 --> 30:45.208
JUST 'CAUSE YOU
SMASH INTO A TREE.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.417
WELL, IT'S JUST, LIKE,

30:47.417 --> 30:49.834
WE'RE ALL JUGGLING WITH
THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS
IN OUR LIVES.

30:49.834 --> 30:52.458
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE A BREAK.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.125
FROM EACH OTHER?

30:55.917 --> 30:57.250
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

30:57.250 --> 30:59.000
I MEAN, IT SEEMS
LIKE WE'VE DRIFTED

30:59.000 --> 30:59.625
DESPITE
OUR BEST EFFORTS.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.125
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.250
YOU MIGHT BE OVERESTIMATING
AT BEST EFFORTS.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.333
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
A COUPLE OF DRUNKEN MISHAPS

31:06.333 --> 31:08.166
AND THE OCCASIONAL CUP
OF COFFEE REALLY CUTS IT.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.208
WELL, THAT'S--

31:14.583 --> 31:15.041
THANK YOU.

31:17.708 --> 31:20.041
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF WE HAD
ACTUALLY DONE THIS DINNER
THING LIKE WE PLANNED,

31:20.041 --> 31:22.875
THE GAP WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN SO WIDE.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.333
WELL, I HAD TO GIVE
MY STELLAR COOKING SKILLS
TIME TO GESTATE.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.542
IT'S ONLY NATURAL, GUYS,
THAT WE DRIFT APART
A LITTLE BIT.

31:27.542 --> 31:31.041
I MEAN, TRITE AS IT SOUNDS,
WE'RE NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL
ANYMORE.

31:34.708 --> 31:36.792
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

31:36.792 --> 31:39.333
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN NAME
2 PEOPLE

31:39.333 --> 31:41.417
THAT I STILL TALK TO
THAT I KNEW WHEN I WAS 15.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.083
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TAKING IT FOR GRANTED.

31:43.083 --> 31:45.041
AND PLUS, YOU KNOW,
NONE OF THEM CAN COOK,

31:45.041 --> 31:47.583
AND THEY'RE ALL HEPPED UP
ON GOOFBALLS.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.000
IT IS ACTUALLY KIND
OF AMAZING THAT WE ALL
STILL KNOW EACH OTHER.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.375
AND I GUESS WE CAN'T
REALLY EXPECT EACH OTHER

31:55.375 --> 31:58.542
TO BE EXACTLY AS WE WERE
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.083
THAT'S A LOT TO EXPECT.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.208
A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.959
WELL, WE'RE ALL
STILL SITTING HERE.

32:05.959 --> 32:08.875
MUST BE SOMETHING WORTH
STICKING AROUND FOR, RIGHT?

32:08.875 --> 32:11.542
WELL, SURE, I MEAN,
THE DESSERT.

32:12.667 --> 32:15.542
OH, AND THE LIFELONG
FRIENDSHIPS.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.959
I'LL TOAST THAT.

32:19.000 --> 32:19.208
CHEERS.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.750
HELLO, EVERYONE.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.417
HEY.
HI.

32:28.417 --> 32:31.917
WHOO! IS THIS THE  GRAMS?

32:31.917 --> 32:35.208
OH, NO OFFENSE, BUT
YOU'RE KINDA A LOT COOLER
THAN I THOUGHT YOU'D BE.

32:35.208 --> 32:39.917
OH, YES, I DO SEEM
TO GET THAT QUITE A BIT.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.333
AND YOU WOULD BE?

32:41.333 --> 32:42.500
OH.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.917
OH, I'M SORRY,
MRS. RYAN.

32:43.917 --> 32:45.250
THIS IS MY ROOMMATE
AUDREY.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.917
OH, SO THIS
IS THE  AUDREY.

32:46.917 --> 32:49.667
YOUR REPUTATION
PROCEEDS YOU.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.208
OH, WELL,
IT USUALLY DOES.

32:51.208 --> 32:54.917
WELL, SOMEONE NEEDED
TO GATHER THE TROOPS.

32:56.166 --> 32:59.625
OH, IT'S LOVELY TO WITNESS
THIS LITTLE REUNION.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.083
AND I WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT THE WEEKEND,

33:02.083 --> 33:06.250
BUT I'M AFRAID
I MUST RETIRE THIS EVENING.

33:07.291 --> 33:08.542
OH, AND, DAWSON,

33:08.542 --> 33:10.625
IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU TO GO
BACK TO CAPESIDE TONIGHT.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.417
YOU'LL SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH US.
OF COURSE.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.583
[COUGHS]

33:13.583 --> 33:15.333
Grams: GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.166
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

33:16.166 --> 33:17.750
GOOD NIGHT, GRAMS.
GOOD NIGHT.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.041
IS THAT CHOCOLATE?

33:19.041 --> 33:21.208
IT IS, INDEED.
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS

33:21.208 --> 33:25.417
I HAVE A SLICE OF THIS
FOR YOU, MRS. RYAN.

33:25.417 --> 33:29.583
Grams: AH, PACEY WITTER,
YOU'LL SPOIL ME.

33:29.583 --> 33:30.834
Pacey: GOOD NIGHT.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.291
WELL, NOT TO BREAK UP AN
OTHERWISE ROCKING EVENING,

33:33.291 --> 33:36.333
BUT, UH, I TOLD SOME GUYS
I'D MEET THEM OUT,
SO I GOTTA GO.

33:36.333 --> 33:37.792
YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD GO, TOO.

33:37.792 --> 33:38.667
I HAVE TO GET
SOME STUDYING IN
BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE.

33:38.667 --> 33:39.917
Audrey: YEAH,
I'M WITH, UH--PACEY,

33:39.917 --> 33:42.875
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
YOU CAN MAKE ME
A TART ANYTIME.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.333
BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.583
OK. YOU GOT THAT ONE
FOR FREE.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.917
HEY, YOU GUYS
WANT TO GET SOME
BREAKFAST TOMORROW?

33:47.917 --> 33:48.834
IS THAT COOL?

33:48.834 --> 33:50.083
YEAH. THAT'D BE NICE.
SURE.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.083
THANKS FOR DINNER,
PACE.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.333
Pace: MY PLEASURE.
BYE.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.500
YOU GUYS TAKE CARE.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.166
Pacey: UM, I'M GONNA START
ON THE DAMAGE CONTROL IN
THE KITCHEN.

34:05.583 --> 34:06.583
HEY.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.208
HEY.

34:09.208 --> 34:11.792
SO I FIGURE THAT
I'VE HEARD A PIECE OF
EVERYBODY'S MIND TODAY

34:11.792 --> 34:12.208
EXCEPT YOURS.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.542
HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT.

34:16.542 --> 34:19.208
[CHUCKLES]
WELL, I'M SORRY, JEN,

34:19.208 --> 34:20.708
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU
THERE.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.125
YOU'LL GET NO JUDGMENTS
OUT OF ME.

34:22.125 --> 34:24.833
BUT THAT'S AWFULLY
DISAPPOINTING

34:24.833 --> 34:27.583
BECAUSE PACEY'S JUDGMENTS
ARE THE BEST KIND.

34:28.917 --> 34:30.458
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

34:30.458 --> 34:33.375
I WOULD BE SATISFIED IF
EVERYBODY WOULD JUST DO WHAT
MAKES THEM HAPPY

34:33.375 --> 34:34.375
AND LEFT IT AT THAT.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.375
BUT THE PLANETS
WOULD COLLIDE,

34:36.375 --> 34:39.542
AND THE SEA WOULD BOIL
OVER WITH BLOOD.

34:39.542 --> 34:40.708
AND DON'T I KNOW IT?

34:40.708 --> 34:42.583
BUT YOU DID SEEM HAPPY.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.291
AT LEAST FOR
THE FIRST 5 MINUTES.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.166
MAYBE NOT SO MUCH
AFTER THAT.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.750
THANK YOU.

34:51.166 --> 34:54.250
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULDN'T GET STUCK
WITH CLEANUP DUTY.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.250
LEAVE IT.

34:55.250 --> 34:58.375
OK? DAWSON AND I
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.333
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
PENANCE OR PITY,

34:59.333 --> 35:03.333
BUT...I'LL TAKE IT
EITHER WAY.

35:03.333 --> 35:04.708
I'D SAY THAT WE SHOULD
DO THIS MORE OFTEN,

35:04.708 --> 35:08.250
BUT I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD GIVE THAT
FURTHER CONSIDERATION

35:08.250 --> 35:09.625
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.

35:09.625 --> 35:10.792
THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.250
YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.875
YOU, TOO.

35:16.375 --> 35:20.000
JOEY, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
GONNA STUDY ALL NIGHT?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.542
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
GOING OUT AND DOING
A COUPLE SHOTS

35:21.542 --> 35:24.375
OR, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
PUNCHING SOMEONE
IN THE FACE?

35:24.375 --> 35:25.750
YOU MEAN,
SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOU?

35:25.750 --> 35:27.417
OH. THAT'S RIGHT.
KEEP IT UP WITH THE FUNNY.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.291
ACTUALLY, I THINK
THE ONLY THING I AM CAPABLE
OF DOING TONIGHT IS STUDYING.

35:31.291 --> 35:32.333
HEY, GUYS.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.625
OH! HEY!

35:33.625 --> 35:34.625
THEY FREED ME FROM
MY CLEANING DUTIES,
SO HERE I AM.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.625
SWEET. YOU WANNA
COME OUT WITH ME?

35:36.625 --> 35:38.291
HMM, THANKS,
BUT NO THANKS.

35:38.291 --> 35:40.250
I THINK ALL MY SOCIAL
GRACES HAVE BEEN USED UP
FOR THE EVENING.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.417
YA KNOW WHAT,
THOUGH?

35:41.417 --> 35:42.291
NO OFFENSE,
BUT BEING COOPED UP

35:42.291 --> 35:44.625
WITH PROFESSOR POTTER
ALL NIGHT

35:44.625 --> 35:46.000
IS QUICKLY LOSING
ITS ALLURE.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.083
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
TAGGED ALONG, JACK?

35:47.083 --> 35:48.125
OF COURSE NOT.

35:48.125 --> 35:49.083
BYE.

35:49.083 --> 35:49.959
BYE.
SEE YA, GUYS.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.333
OK, WE'RE SO GOING
TO A GAY BAR.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.500
YOUR EFFORTS TO
SET ME UP DEFINITELY
CALL FOR REVENGE.

36:05.041 --> 36:06.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I ENVY
IN YOU, PACE?

36:08.208 --> 36:10.625
YOUR ABILITY TO SEE
THE BIG PICTURE.

36:10.625 --> 36:14.333
AH, WELL, I AM THE VISIONARY
OF OUR GENERATIONS.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.875
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,
WHEN THINGS GOT TOUGH FOR YOU,

36:18.875 --> 36:22.000
YOU KNEW THAT THE THING TO DO
WAS TO TAKE A BREAK FROM WHAT
WAS EXPECTED FROM YOU.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.458
I MEAN, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
INCREDIBLE OUT AT SEA,

36:24.458 --> 36:27.417
TO BE ABLE TO START ALL OVER
WITH YOURSELF.

36:27.417 --> 36:29.500
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
GIVING ME A LITTLE
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.166
THE ONLY THING I KNEW
THAT I WANTED WAS
TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

36:32.166 --> 36:34.458
IT'S ONLY LATER
THAT IT BECAME
A PROFOUND JOURNEY.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.000
[CHUCKLES]
I MEAN, WHAT DO I KNOW?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.667
I THINK IT'S JUST
A PART OF GROWING UP.

36:38.667 --> 36:43.667
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M ACTING
LIKE I THINK JOEY POTTER
IS SUPPOSED TO ACT.

36:44.834 --> 36:46.000
YOU KNOW, I'M--

36:46.000 --> 36:48.500
EVERYTHING THAT I THOUGHT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO WANT

36:48.500 --> 36:50.834
AND TO HAVE IS SHIFTED.

36:50.834 --> 36:55.166
I JUST FEEL
LIKE I'M FLOUNDERING.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.500
JOEY, YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN I'VE EVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.250
YOU GOT THE NEW SCHOOL,
THE WRITING,
THE NEW FRIENDS.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.792
YOU ARE BECOMING
THE WOMAN

37:01.792 --> 37:03.708
THAT I ALWAYS KNEW YOU
WERE GOING TO BECOME.

37:03.708 --> 37:06.083
SO WHERE IS THE FLAW
IN THAT?

37:06.083 --> 37:07.458
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:12.583 --> 37:15.000
I EXPECTED THIS FROM HIM.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.375
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY THINK
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE
WOULD CHANGE,

37:19.375 --> 37:22.208
BUT WE'D SOMEHOW REMAIN
THE SAME?

37:22.208 --> 37:26.959
I MEAN, PROMISES WE MADE
BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW
HOW WE WOULD TURN OUT,

37:26.959 --> 37:28.792
IT SEEMS A LITTLE CRAZY.

37:28.792 --> 37:30.708
THE THINGS
WE REALLY WANT

37:30.708 --> 37:33.500
ALWAYS SEEM
LIKE A GOOD IDEA
AT THE TIME.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.083
PACE, I DON'T THINK
I EXACTLY WANTED IT.

37:40.458 --> 37:44.333
THERE WAS THIS SMALL PART
OF ME THAT WAS RELIEVED
TO GET A BREAK

37:44.333 --> 37:46.667
AND WAS RELIEVED TO KNOW
THAT SOMEONE ELSE

37:46.667 --> 37:49.083
WAS GOING TO BE
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.083
AND NOW...

37:56.083 --> 37:59.708
YOU JUST DIDN'T EXPECT
TO LOSE YOUR PLACE?

38:03.458 --> 38:05.083
IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.417
NO. IT DOESN'T SOUND
HORRIBLE,

38:06.417 --> 38:08.250
IT JUST SOUNDS
LIKE THE TRUTH.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.708
I AM A FIRM BELIEVER
THAT THINGS HAPPEN
FOR A REASON.

38:10.708 --> 38:15.125
AND THINGS HAVE
A WONDERFUL HABIT OF
WORKING THEMSELVES OUT

38:15.125 --> 38:17.708
REGARDLESS OF HOW
YOU MAY PLAN THEM
TO THE CONTRARY.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.417
SO, IS THIS WHERE YOU TAKE
YOUR CONQUESTS TO DIE?

38:39.417 --> 38:41.625
[LAUGHS]

38:41.625 --> 38:43.542
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THE DARK.

38:43.542 --> 38:45.041
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME
UP HERE, ARE YOU?

38:45.041 --> 38:47.583
I DON'T THINK IT
WOULD BE VERY PROPER

38:47.583 --> 38:50.458
TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH YOU
IN MY GRANDMA'S--NO!

38:50.458 --> 38:51.708
[LAUGHING]
DAWSON, PUT ME DOWN!

38:51.708 --> 38:53.417
PUT ME DOWN. PUT ME DOWN.

38:57.792 --> 39:00.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
IS SCARIER THAN AN ATTIC?

39:00.000 --> 39:00.959
WHAT?

39:00.959 --> 39:02.125
A BASEMENT.

39:02.125 --> 39:03.542
WHY?
BECAUSE IT HAS STAIRS,

39:03.542 --> 39:06.125
AND BECAUSE THINGS HIDE
UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS.

39:06.125 --> 39:07.000
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THINGS
HIDING UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
YES.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.667
AND IN CLOSETS
AND UNDERNEATH THE BEDS.

39:11.667 --> 39:14.291
YOU ARE DEEPLY DISTURBED.
I HAD NO IDEA.

39:14.959 --> 39:17.500
THAT IS ADORABLE.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.917
HUSH.

39:18.917 --> 39:22.625
WELL, IT'S A KIND
OF THING THAT ONLY
BOYFRIENDS ARE PRIVY TO.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.500
SO...

39:32.500 --> 39:35.917
WANNA TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

39:37.708 --> 39:38.166
NAH.

39:38.166 --> 39:39.250
OK.

39:39.250 --> 39:43.542
GUESS YOU CAN'T CHANGE
REALITY.

39:43.542 --> 39:44.583
NO.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.583
THERE'S EVEN SOMETHING
CATHARTIC ABOUT IT.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.708
I'VE HAD IT
WITH CATHARSIS.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.041
I'M TAKING A BREAK.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.917
ONLY FOR
THE WINTER MONTHS.

39:53.917 --> 39:55.583
YOU CAN'T HAVE HAD IT
WITH CATHARSIS.

39:55.583 --> 39:56.000
WE'VE STILL GOT NEW YEAR'S
AHEAD OF US.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.041
[LAUGHS]

39:58.041 --> 39:59.250
DAWSON...

40:01.667 --> 40:04.041
CAN WE JUST BE BORING?

40:05.125 --> 40:07.542
I WANT TO BE VERY, VERY,
VERY BORING.

40:07.542 --> 40:11.208
WELL, I HATE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU, JEN,

40:11.208 --> 40:15.542
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
BOREDOM IS NOT EXACTLY
THE FEELING YOU INSPIRE.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.667
NO?
MM-MM.

40:17.667 --> 40:21.667
DAWSON, I THINK
THAT THIS ROOM
HAS POSSIBILITIES.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.667
WHAT KIND OF POSSIBILITIES?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.708
THE KIND WE CAN TALK
ABOUT TOMORROW.
