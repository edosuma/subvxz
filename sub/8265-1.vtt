Forgive me, I didn't mean
to alarm you, gentlemen.

19:56.571 --> 19:59.859
I had Robby install
the steel shutters before I realized...

20:00.032 --> 20:01.864
...how altogether safe I am here.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.787
Well, gentlemen,
this has been very pleasant.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.044
You've seen how comfortable
I am here, no hardships...

20:15.214 --> 20:18.047
...no special difficulties...

20:18.217 --> 20:20.800
...and no need
at all for military assistance.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.507
Now, I dare say you're impatient
to get back to base.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.514
Yes, sir, the moment we've interviewed
the other members...

20:26.684 --> 20:28.516
...of the Be/erephon party.

20:28.686 --> 20:32.304

But there are no others, commander.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.766
Before the first year was out,
they had all, every man and woman...

20:35.985 --> 20:40.149
...succumbed to a--
To a sort of a planetary force here.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.987
Some dark, terrible,
incomprehensible force.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.901
Only my wife and I were immune.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.905
And just how do you account
for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?

20:50.082 --> 20:54.167
My wife and I differed from the others
only in our love for this new world.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.541
In our boundless longing
to make a home here...

20:57.715 --> 21:01.299
...far from the scurry and strife
of humankind.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.178
I remember how when the vote
was taken to return to Earth...

21:06.349 --> 21:09.432
...she and I were utterly heartbroken.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.309
How could we have foreseen
the extinction...

21:12.480 --> 21:15.188
...of so many coworkers and friends.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.771
Skipper, there is no record of any wife
in the Be/erephon rolls.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.107
Oh, lieutenant,
look under biochemistry.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.274
Julia Marsin. She and I were married
by the skipper on the voyage here.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.158
I have the certificate.

21:27.328 --> 21:31.743
I thought Robby had managed
some very charming feminine touches.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.283
I take it Mrs. Morbius
isn't at home today?

21:34.460 --> 21:37.794
My dear wife died a few months
after the others.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.298
Only in her case
it was of natural causes.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.253
DOC:
I'm very sorry.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.842
Dr. Morbius, just what were
the symptoms of all those other deaths?

21:48.015 --> 21:51.758
- The unnatural ones, I mean.
- The symptoms were striking.

21:51.936 --> 21:55.600
One by one, in spite of every safeguard,
my coworkers were torn...

21:55.773 --> 21:58.265
-...literally limb from limb.
- By what?

21:58.442 --> 22:00.729
By some devilish thing
that never showed itself.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.485
- And the Be/erephon?
- Vaporized...

22:02.655 --> 22:05.898
...as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.827
And yet in all these 19 years...

22:10.997 --> 22:15.491
...you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force?

22:17.336 --> 22:20.704
Only in nightmares of those times.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.381
And yet, always in my mind,
I seem to feel the creature...

22:24.552 --> 22:28.671
...is lurking somewhere close at hand.
Sly and irresistible.

But, Father, lunch is over.

about not coming in for coffee.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.043
- My daughter.
- How do you do?

23:01.213 --> 23:05.081

a young man and now three at once.

get you some coffee?

Oh, I'm quite able to get it.
Thank you.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.355

Of course, you must make allowances
for my daughter, gentlemen.

any human being except her father.

in certain ways.

That's only in certain ways,

but I don't seem to understand it.

to make the trip to Earth with her...

...for the sake
of her natural development.

I should say fairly soon too.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.827

at first about your meeting us, was he?

24:24.004 --> 24:26.746
Well, naturally not.
You're from Earth.

- How lucky I am, though.

are such very fine exceptions.

throughout seven planetary systems.

any fire in your eyes, lieutenant.

a very kindly concern...

But, commander,
suppose these new instructions...

for questioning.

Tell me, just what is involved
in your making contact with Earth base?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.401
Well, fundamentally, it's a question
of crude power.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.780
How to short-circuit the continuum
on a five- or six-parsec level.

28:20.949 --> 28:24.317
Of course, a transmitter of that sort
isn't exactly standard equipment.

28:24.495 --> 28:27.283
To build one, we'd have
to cannibalize about two-thirds...

28:27.456 --> 28:31.040
...of a ship's electronic gear, and then
unship the main drive to juice it.

28:31.210 --> 28:35.295
Just to construct a bunker to house
a core would take about 1O days.

Well, that sounded final.

01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:06.036
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

That is true, sir.

Robby, let them in.

Why are you here?

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:03.928
We were attacked. Three more
men dead, including Jerry Farman.

I don't know...

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:18.240
...it was just some kind of
big outline in the disintegrator beams.

- And you can't explain it?
- No.

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:25.866
Well, anyway, we fought it,
and we lost.

- Then you must leave now.

I just can't.

- Then we'll take him.
- By force? I can't agree to that either.

Now, easy, Doc.

01:24:37.448 --> 01:24:41.783
Morbius was too close
to the problem.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.865
The Krell had completed their project.

- Yes, what?

Monsters, John.

could contain the secrets of the Krell.

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.975

and now he's paid.

Young man, my daughter is planning
a foolish action, and she'll be punished.

- Id, id, id.

It's a...

It's an obsolete term...

...I'm afraid, once used to describe...

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:44.105
...the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind.

Monsters from the subconscious.

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:57.998
Of course, that's what Doc meant.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.965
Morbius, the big machine,
8000 cubic miles of klystron relays.

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:06.002
Enough power for a whole
population of creative geniuses.

Operated by remote control.

- To what purpose?

01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:18.481
In return, that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter...

...to any point on the planet. In any
shape or color they might imagine.

01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:24.562
For any purpose, Morbius.

Why haven't I seen this all along?

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:33.821
But like you, the Krell
forgot one deadly danger...

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.993
...their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction.

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:42.212
The beast.
The mindless primitive.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.712
Even the Krell must have evolved
from that beginning.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:50.046
And so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious had access...

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.430
...to a machine
that could never be shut down.

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.552

Fifteen seconds.

01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:48.543
Yes, Alta, your father,
my shipmates...

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.382
...all the stored knowledge
of the Krell.

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:55.884
Five seconds, four, three...

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:59.143
...two, one.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:13.651
Alta, about a million years
from now...

01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:16.786
...the human race
will have crawled up to where...

01:37:16.956 --> 01:37:23.123
...the Krell stood in their
great moment of triumph and tragedy...

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:30.672
...and your father's name
will shine again...

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.462
...like a beacon in the galaxy.

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:37.679
It's true...

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:42.179
...it will remind us
that we are, after all, not God.

01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:26.306
