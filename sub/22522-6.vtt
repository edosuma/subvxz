00:55.051 --> 00:57.383
<i>... bound for the sun.</i>

00:57.587 --> 01:02.524
<i>We would discover it surrounded by</i>
<i>four giant, cloudy, gas worlds:</i>

01:03.026 --> 01:06.553
<i>Blue Neptune and its</i>
<i>frozen moon, Triton.</i>

01:09.432 --> 01:13.630
<i>And then farther in, Uranus</i>
<i>and its dark rings...</i>

01:13.837 --> 01:17.136
<i>... made perhaps of organic matter.</i>

01:32.489 --> 01:37.051
<i>Saturn, the jewel</i>

01:37.494 --> 01:41.396
<i>... set within concentric rings...</i>

01:41.598 --> 01:46.297
<i>... composed of a billion icy moons.</i>

01:58.081 --> 02:02.780
<i>And finally, flanked by massive</i>

02:02.986 --> 02:06.285
<i>... the largest planet, Jupiter.</i>

02:06.756 --> 02:08.621
<i>Its multicolored clouds...</i>

02:08.825 --> 02:12.090
<i>... studded with flashes of lightning.</i>

02:17.066 --> 02:18.897
<i>Still farther in...</i>

02:19.269 --> 02:21.533
<i>... closer to the sun...</i>

02:21.905 --> 02:24.499
<i>... there are no more</i>
<i>giant planets...</i>

02:24.874 --> 02:28.241
<i>... only a host of lesser worlds...</i>

02:28.445 --> 02:30.777
<i>... made of rock and metal...</i>

02:30.980 --> 02:34.575
<i>... some with a thin envelope of air.</i>

02:34.784 --> 02:36.411
<i>They huddle about the sun...</i>

02:36.619 --> 02:39.884
<i>... with almost no internal heat of</i>
<i>their own...</i>

02:40.457 --> 02:43.756
<i>... tiny places with solid surfaces...</i>

02:43.960 --> 02:47.828
<i>... one of which is a blue</i>
<i>and pretty world...</i>

02:48.031 --> 02:49.589

02:50.667 --> 02:52.294
<i>Half-covered with clouds...</i>

03:56.432 --> 03:57.490
Yes, I am.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.767
SAGAN:
<i>The spacecraft had been instructed...</i>

03:59.969 --> 04:01.732
<i>... how to explore</i>
<i>the Jupiter system...</i>

04:01.938 --> 04:03.906

04:05.975 --> 04:07.909
Power, 450 watts.

04:08.177 --> 04:09.644
Power is go at this time.

04:09.846 --> 04:11.438
DSE systems.

04:15.051 --> 04:17.144
LACP mode is far and counter.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.251
We are at take 210.

04:19.455 --> 04:22.856
Direction last recorded was reversed,
and the track is track one.

04:23.059 --> 04:26.426
<i>Here we check how faithful</i>
<i>an emissary</i> Voyager <i>is.</i>

04:27.297 --> 04:29.231
<i>Does it understand the commands?</i>

04:29.432 --> 04:31.593
<i>How is its health, its temperature...</i>

04:31.868 --> 04:33.267
<i>... its brains...</i>

04:33.469 --> 04:34.458
<i>... its heart?</i>

04:35.371 --> 04:37.464
Yes, detailed science is coming up...

04:38.241 --> 04:40.106
"A" systems...

04:40.510 --> 04:42.444

SAGAN: <i>The modern ships that sail to</i>

04:50.720 --> 04:52.449
<i>They are beautifully constructed...</i>

04:52.655 --> 04:55.920
<i>... semi-intelligent robots.</i>

04:56.526 --> 04:59.256
Voyager's <i>eyes are</i>
<i>two television cameras...</i>

04:59.462 --> 05:04.092
<i>... designed to take many thousands</i>

05:08.237 --> 05:10.899
<i>... which points at passing planets.</i>

05:11.274 --> 05:16.075
Voyager's <i>brains are three integrated</i>

05:16.279 --> 05:19.180
<i>It communicates with Earth</i>

05:28.925 --> 05:33.294
<i>Its louvers open and shut to help</i>
<i>control the on-board temperature.</i>

05:34.464 --> 05:37.228
<i>But</i> Voyager <i>cruises</i>
<i>so far from the sun...</i>

05:37.433 --> 05:39.594
<i>... that it cannot depend</i>
<i>on solar power.</i>

05:39.802 --> 05:43.363
<i>Instead, it has a small</i>
<i>nuclear power plant...</i>

05:43.573 --> 05:46.701
<i>... quarantined from the rest</i>
<i>of the ship.</i>

05:56.185 --> 05:59.154
<i>Many things can go wrong</i>
<i>in such pioneering missions.</i>

05:59.622 --> 06:01.817
<i>So people are a little uneasy...</i>

06:02.025 --> 06:04.357
<i>... at</i> Voyager <i>mission control.</i>

06:04.761 --> 06:08.322
<i>Jupiter is surrounded by a shell of</i>
<i>invisible but extremely dangerous...</i>

06:08.531 --> 06:10.522
<i>... high-energy charged particles.</i>

06:11.234 --> 06:13.031
<i>If</i> Voyager <i>flies too close...</i>

06:13.236 --> 06:16.364
<i>... its delicate electronics</i>

06:16.572 --> 06:19.769
<i>A collision with a small boulder</i>
<i>in the rings of Jupiter...</i>

06:19.976 --> 06:23.139
<i>... could send the spacecraft tumbling</i>
<i>wildly out of control...</i>

06:23.346 --> 06:27.077
<i>... its antenna unable to find</i>
<i>the Earth, its data lost forever.</i>

06:32.288 --> 06:34.415
Voyager 1 <i>and</i> Voyager 2...

06:34.624 --> 06:38.720
<i>... were launched a month apart</i>
<i>in late summer of 1977.</i>

06:38.928 --> 06:41.226
<i>After many alarms and close calls...</i>

06:41.431 --> 06:45.162
<i>... they successfully arrived months</i>
<i>apart at the Jupiter system...</i>

06:45.368 --> 06:46.892
<i>... where they worked brilliantly...</i>

06:47.103 --> 06:49.970
<i>... providing the first close-up views</i>
<i>of mighty Jupiter...</i>

06:50.173 --> 06:53.006
<i>... and its four large</i>
<i>and mysterious moons:</i>

06:53.209 --> 06:56.838
<i>lo, the innermost of the four...</i>

06:57.380 --> 06:58.870
<i>... Europa...</i>

06:59.115 --> 07:02.380
<i>... and moving away from Jupiter...</i>

07:02.585 --> 07:04.052
<i>... Ganymede...</i>

07:05.455 --> 07:08.856
<i>... and the outermost big moon...</i>

07:09.058 --> 07:10.423
<i>... Callisto.</i>

07:12.128 --> 07:16.428
<i>In a mission that costs</i>
<i>a penny a world...</i>

07:16.632 --> 07:19.965
<i>... for every human</i>
<i>on the planet Earth.</i>

07:26.375 --> 07:28.639
<i>Voyager's</i> passage by Jupiter...

07:28.845 --> 07:32.042
...accelerated it towards
the planet Saturn.

07:32.248 --> 07:35.308
Saturn's gravity will
propel it on to Uranus...

07:35.518 --> 07:39.284
...and in this game of cosmic
billiards, after Uranus...

07:39.489 --> 07:43.687
...it will plunge on past Neptune,
leaving the solar system...

07:43.893 --> 07:46.293
...and becoming
an interstellar spacecraft...

07:46.496 --> 07:49.294
...destined to wander forever...

07:49.499 --> 07:52.093

07:52.301 --> 07:56.101
<i>And if</i> Voyager <i>should,</i>
<i>sometime in its distant future...</i>

07:56.305 --> 08:01.004

08:03.846 --> 08:07.714
A phonograph record.
Golden, delicate...

08:08.785 --> 08:10.480
...with instruction for use.

08:10.753 --> 08:15.383
And on this record are a sampling of
pictures, sounds, greetings...

08:16.025 --> 08:18.289
...and an hour and a half
of exquisite music...

08:18.494 --> 08:21.054
...the Earth's greatest hits.

08:21.264 --> 08:23.198
A gift across the cosmic ocean...

08:23.399 --> 08:27.563
...from one island of civilization
to another.

08:29.172 --> 08:32.300
The record bears in English...

08:32.508 --> 08:35.409
...an additional handwritten
greeting that says:

08:35.978 --> 08:40.711
"To the makers of music,
all worlds, all times."

08:41.017 --> 08:44.418
<i>These voyages of exploration</i>
<i>and discovery...</i>

08:44.787 --> 08:47.688
<i>... are the latest in a long series</i>
<i>which have characterized...</i>

08:47.890 --> 08:51.257
<i>... and distinguished</i>
<i>the human species.</i>

08:51.460 --> 08:53.690
<i>In the 15th and 16th centuries...</i>

08:53.896 --> 08:57.263
<i>... you could travel from Spain</i>

08:57.466 --> 09:00.435
<i>The same time it takes now</i>
<i>to cross that little channel...</i>

09:00.636 --> 09:02.695
<i>... from the Earth to the moon.</i>

09:03.706 --> 09:07.073
<i>It took, then, a few months</i>
<i>to traverse the Atlantic Ocean...</i>

09:07.276 --> 09:09.938
<i>... and reach what was called</i>
<i>the "New World"...</i>

09:10.146 --> 09:11.135
<i>... the Americas.</i>

09:11.347 --> 09:15.113
<i>Today it takes a few months</i>
<i>to cross the inner solar system...</i>

09:15.318 --> 09:18.378
<i>... and reach Mars and Venus,</i>
<i>truly and literally...</i>

09:18.588 --> 09:20.783
<i>... new worlds awaiting us.</i>

09:22.124 --> 09:23.921
<i>In the 17th and 18th centuries...</i>

09:24.126 --> 09:28.358
<i>... you could travel from Holland</i>
<i>to China, say, in a year or two...</i>

09:28.564 --> 09:30.623
<i>... the same time</i>
<i>it takes now for</i> Voyager...

09:30.833 --> 09:33.233
<i>... to travel from the Earth</i>
<i>to Jupiter.</i>

09:37.006 --> 09:40.498
<i>And in comparison to the resources</i>
<i>of the society...</i>

09:40.710 --> 09:44.043
<i>... it cost more then to send</i>
<i>sailing ships to the Far East...</i>

09:44.247 --> 09:47.774
<i>... than it does now</i>
<i>to send spaceships to the planets.</i>

09:51.520 --> 09:53.511
<i>The passion to explore...</i>

09:53.723 --> 09:56.055
<i>... is at the heart of being human.</i>

09:56.259 --> 09:58.989
<i>This impulse to go,</i>
<i>to see, to know...</i>

09:59.195 --> 10:01.720
<i>... has found expression</i>
<i>in every culture.</i>

10:03.466 --> 10:06.924
<i>Africa was circumnavigated</i>
<i>by Phoenician sailors...</i>

10:07.136 --> 10:09.730
<i>... in the employ</i>
<i>of an Egyptian pharaoh...</i>

10:09.939 --> 10:12.965
<i>... in the 7th century B.C.</i>

10:14.243 --> 10:16.677
<i>The islands of the Pacific</i>
<i>were settled...</i>

10:16.879 --> 10:20.315
<i>... by skilled and heroic navigators</i>
<i>from Indonesia.</i>

10:21.784 --> 10:24.378
<i>Great fleets of ocean-going junks...</i>

10:24.587 --> 10:27.454
<i>... left the ports</i>
<i>of Ming Dynasty China...</i>

10:27.657 --> 10:30.421
<i>... to explore India and Africa.</i>

10:31.127 --> 10:33.823
<i>A century later,</i>
<i>three ships left Spain...</i>

10:34.030 --> 10:36.396
<i>... under the command</i>
<i>of an Italian navigator...</i>

10:36.599 --> 10:38.692
<i>... to discover the Americas.</i>

10:39.568 --> 10:42.435
<i>And then a Portuguese</i>
<i>expedition succeeded...</i>

10:42.638 --> 10:46.267
<i>... in sailing all the way</i>
<i>around this blue globe.</i>

10:47.710 --> 10:50.304
<i>These voyagers of many cultures...</i>

10:50.513 --> 10:53.175
<i>... were the first planetary explorers.</i>

10:53.382 --> 10:56.476
<i>They have bound the Earth up</i>
<i>into one world.</i>

10:56.686 --> 10:58.745
<i>In our exploration</i>
<i>of other worlds...</i>

10:58.955 --> 11:01.583
<i>... we follow in their footsteps.</i>

11:03.693 --> 11:06.753
Our present spaceships
are the harbingers...

11:06.963 --> 11:11.900
...the vanguard of future human
expeditions to the planets.

11:12.501 --> 11:15.470
We have traveled this way before...

11:15.671 --> 11:18.834
...and there is much to be learned...

11:19.041 --> 11:22.943
...by studying those great voyages of
a few centuries ago.

11:37.093 --> 11:38.651
<i>In the 17th century...</i>

11:38.861 --> 11:41.329
<i>... the citizens of the new Dutch</i>
<i>Republic...</i>

11:41.530 --> 11:46.092
<i>... pursued a course of vigorous</i>
<i>planetary exploration.</i>

11:47.770 --> 11:50.170
<i>Holland was then</i>
<i>a revolutionary society.</i>

11:50.373 --> 11:53.342
<i>It had just declared its</i>
<i>independence from the powerful...</i>

11:53.542 --> 11:55.533
<i>... but stagnant Spanish empire...</i>

11:55.745 --> 11:57.940
<i>... and with a new found</i>
<i>self-confidence...</i>

11:58.147 --> 12:01.082
<i>... Holland embraced, more fully than</i>
<i>any other nation of its time...</i>

12:01.283 --> 12:04.741
<i>... the spirit of the European</i>
<i>Enlightenment.</i>

12:09.492 --> 12:13.121
It was a rational, orderly
and creative society.

12:13.329 --> 12:16.730
<i>But because Spanish ports and vessels</i>
<i>were closed to the Dutch...</i>

12:16.932 --> 12:19.093
<i>... the economic survival</i>
<i>of the tiny republic...</i>

12:19.301 --> 12:23.533
<i>... depended on its ability to</i>
<i>construct, man and operate...</i>

12:23.739 --> 12:26.469
<i>... a great fleet of commercial</i>
<i>sailing vessels.</i>

12:30.780 --> 12:32.611
<i>The Dutch East India Company...</i>

12:32.815 --> 12:35.909
<i>... was a combined governmental</i>
<i>and commercial enterprise...</i>

12:36.118 --> 12:38.746
<i>... which sent shipping</i>
<i>to the far corners of the world...</i>

12:38.954 --> 12:43.448
<i>... to acquire rare commodities and</i>
<i>resell them at a profit in Europe.</i>

12:43.659 --> 12:47.254
<i>Such voyages were the life's blood</i>
<i>of the republic.</i>

12:51.233 --> 12:55.465
<i>Navigational charts and maps</i>
<i>were classified as state secrets.</i>

12:55.838 --> 12:58.966
<i>Ships sometimes left</i>
<i>with sealed sailing orders...</i>

12:59.175 --> 13:02.167
<i>... the crews embarking</i>
<i>for an unknown destination...</i>

13:02.378 --> 13:06.178
<i>... more than a year away</i>
<i>on the far side of the planet.</i>

13:09.018 --> 13:12.283
<i>These expeditions were not only</i>
<i>commercial exploitations...</i>

13:12.488 --> 13:14.547
<i>... although there was certainly</i>
<i>plenty of that.</i>

13:14.757 --> 13:17.988
<i>Beside the usual appeals</i>
<i>of ambition, greed...</i>

13:18.194 --> 13:20.924
<i>... national pride</i>
<i>and the thirst for adventure...</i>

13:21.297 --> 13:25.131
<i>... the Dutch were also motivated</i>
<i>by a powerful scientific curiosity...</i>

13:25.334 --> 13:27.962
<i>... and a fascination with</i>
<i>all things new.</i>

13:28.170 --> 13:31.105
<i>New lands, new peoples...</i>

13:31.307 --> 13:32.934
<i>... new plants and animals.</i>

13:38.614 --> 13:42.015
<i>This building,</i>
<i>then the Amsterdam town hall...</i>

13:42.218 --> 13:45.346
<i>... still attests</i>
<i>to the hardy self-assurance...</i>

13:45.554 --> 13:47.488
<i>... of its 17th-century architects.</i>

13:47.690 --> 13:51.148
<i>Its lavish crystal adornments</i>
<i>still reflect...</i>

13:51.360 --> 13:54.352
<i>... the glittering pride they felt</i>
<i>in their accomplishments...</i>

13:54.563 --> 13:55.996
<i>... and their prosperity.</i>

13:56.198 --> 13:59.599
<i>It took shiploads of marble</i>
<i>to build this place.</i>

13:59.802 --> 14:03.898
<i>Constantin Huygens, a poet</i>
<i>and diplomat of the time...</i>

14:04.106 --> 14:07.564
<i>... said that this town hall</i>
<i>dispelled what he called...</i>

14:07.776 --> 14:11.143
<i>..."the Gothic squint and squalor."</i>

14:12.948 --> 14:17.783
<i>The Middle Ages had ended,</i>
<i>the Enlightenment had begun.</i>

14:21.357 --> 14:23.587
Up there, do you see...

14:23.792 --> 14:28.229
...is Atlas supporting the heavens
on his shoulders.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.458
And beneath...

14:31.901 --> 14:34.870
...is Justice with a golden sword...

14:35.070 --> 14:37.732
...and golden scales flanked...

14:38.674 --> 14:41.734
...by Death and Punishment.

14:42.244 --> 14:46.442
And who is it that Justice
is trampling underfoot?

14:46.649 --> 14:51.018
Why, it's Avarice and Envy...

14:51.220 --> 14:53.950
...the gods of the merchants.

14:54.156 --> 14:58.217
The Dutch knew that the unrestrained
pursuit of profit...

14:58.427 --> 15:02.158
...posed serious threats
to the soul of the nation.

15:03.365 --> 15:05.833
A less allegorical symbol...

15:06.035 --> 15:08.731
...is down here, on the floor.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.238
It is a great inlaid map...

15:15.444 --> 15:20.143
...stretching from West Africa
to the Pacific Ocean.

15:20.349 --> 15:24.217
The whole world was then
Holland's arena.

15:25.754 --> 15:28.621
In a typical year, many sailing
vessels...

15:28.824 --> 15:32.123
...set out halfway around the world
for the Far East...

15:32.328 --> 15:36.389
...on voyages of exploration
and discovery, of trade...

15:36.599 --> 15:39.397
...journeys taking years
to accomplish.

15:39.602 --> 15:43.561
Down the west coast of Africa, through
what they called the Ethiopian sea...

15:43.772 --> 15:46.570
...skirting the southern coast
of Africa...

15:46.775 --> 15:49.505
...through the Straits
of Madagascar...

15:49.712 --> 15:53.512
...and on past the southern tip
of India...

15:53.716 --> 15:58.619
...to the Spice Islands
and present-day Indonesia.

16:03.726 --> 16:07.321
<i>Another set of voyages went south</i>
<i>then east, to New Holland...</i>

16:07.529 --> 16:10.054
<i>... later renamed Australia.</i>

16:15.604 --> 16:19.665
<i>And still other journeys ventured</i>
<i>through the Straits of Malacca...</i>

16:20.142 --> 16:22.770
<i>... to the Empire of China.</i>

16:24.413 --> 16:29.282
But Holland was a small country
forced to live by its wits.

16:29.485 --> 16:32.181
There was a strong pacifist element
in its foreign policy.

16:32.988 --> 16:36.719
Never before or since
has Holland boasted such a galaxy...

16:36.925 --> 16:40.622
...of scientists, mathematicians,
philosophers and artists.

16:42.631 --> 16:46.067
This was the time of the great
painters, Rembrandt...

16:47.236 --> 16:48.931
...and Vermeer.

16:50.439 --> 16:55.206
Because Holland was tolerant
of unorthodox opinions...

16:55.411 --> 16:58.175
...it was a refuge
for intellectuals...

16:58.380 --> 17:02.714
...fleeing the thought control and
censorship of other parts of Europe...

17:03.052 --> 17:06.818
...much as the United States benefited
enormously in the 1930s...

17:07.022 --> 17:09.684
...from the exodus of intellectuals...

17:09.892 --> 17:12.087
...from Nazi-dominated Europe.

17:12.294 --> 17:14.888
And so it was that
17 th-century Holland...

17:15.097 --> 17:18.658
...was the home of the great
Jewish philosopher Spinoza...

17:18.867 --> 17:21.267
...who Einstein admired so much...

17:21.470 --> 17:24.303
...of René Descartes,
a pivotal figure...

17:24.506 --> 17:27.566
...in the history of philosophy
and of mathematics...

17:27.776 --> 17:32.042
...and the home of a political
scientist named John Locke...

17:32.247 --> 17:35.478
...who was to have a powerful...

17:35.684 --> 17:37.549
...and profound influence...

17:37.753 --> 17:41.849
...on a group of philosophically
inclined revolutionaries...

17:42.057 --> 17:45.857
...named Paine, Hamilton, Adams...

17:46.061 --> 17:48.222
...Franklin and Jefferson.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.401
The Dutch University of Leyden...

17:53.602 --> 17:58.403
...offered a professorship to an
Italian scientist named Galileo...

17:58.607 --> 18:01.440
...who had been forced
by the Catholic Church...

18:01.643 --> 18:03.406
...under threat of torture...

18:03.612 --> 18:06.513
...to recant the heretical position...

18:06.715 --> 18:11.243
...that the Earth went around the sun
and not vice versa.

18:11.553 --> 18:13.987
Galileo had close ties
with Holland.

18:14.189 --> 18:16.020
His first astronomical telescope
was based...

18:16.225 --> 18:19.217
...on a spyglass
of Dutch manufacture.

18:19.428 --> 18:23.489
And with it, he discovered
the craters of the moon...

18:23.699 --> 18:28.398
...the phases of Venus and the
four large moons of Jupiter.

18:30.806 --> 18:32.933
<i>Becoming an exploratory power...</i>

18:33.142 --> 18:37.238
<i>... made Holland a vital intellectual</i>
<i>and cultural center as well.</i>

18:37.446 --> 18:42.008
<i>The improvement of sailing technology</i>
<i>spurred technology in general.</i>

18:42.618 --> 18:46.645
<i>A key problem in navigation was</i>
<i>the determination of longitude.</i>

18:46.855 --> 18:48.823
<i>Latitude could be determined</i>
<i>easily...</i>

18:49.024 --> 18:51.993
<i>... the farther south, the more</i>
<i>southern constellations you could see.</i>

18:52.594 --> 18:56.587
<i>But longitude required precise</i>
<i>timekeeping.</i>

18:59.034 --> 19:00.001
<i>An accurate shipboard clock...</i>

19:00.202 --> 19:02.762
<i>... would continue to keep time</i>
<i>in your home port.</i>

19:02.971 --> 19:06.099
<i>The rising and setting of stars</i>
<i>would give you the local time...</i>

19:06.308 --> 19:08.799
<i>... and the difference</i>
<i>between the two...</i>

19:09.011 --> 19:11.502
<i>... would tell you how far</i>
<i>east or west you had gone.</i>

19:14.883 --> 19:17.511
<i>Technological advance</i>
<i>required the freest...</i>

19:17.719 --> 19:19.209
<i>... possible pursuit of knowledge.</i>

19:19.621 --> 19:23.557
<i>So Holland became the leading</i>
<i>publisher and bookseller in Europe...</i>

19:23.759 --> 19:25.818
<i>... translating works written</i>
<i>in other languages...</i>

19:26.028 --> 19:29.225
<i>... and printing books</i>
<i>that had been censored elsewhere.</i>

19:30.899 --> 19:33.424
<i>Adventures into exotic lands...</i>

19:33.635 --> 19:36.069
<i>... and encounters</i>
<i>with strange societies...</i>

19:36.271 --> 19:37.829
<i>... shook complacency.</i>

19:40.008 --> 19:42.238
<i>They challenged</i>
<i>the prevailing wisdom...</i>

19:42.444 --> 19:45.845
<i>... and showed that ideas accepted</i>
<i>for thousands of years...</i>

19:46.048 --> 19:48.243
<i>... might be fundamentally in error.</i>

20:00.562 --> 20:04.555
<i>In a time when kings and emperors</i>
<i>ruled much of the planet...</i>

20:04.766 --> 20:08.224
<i>... the Dutch Republic was governed,</i>
<i>more than any other world power...</i>

20:08.437 --> 20:09.836
<i>... by the people.</i>

20:16.078 --> 20:19.605
<i>They enjoyed a certain</i>
<i>material well-being.</i>

20:19.815 --> 20:21.908
<i>But the interiors of their houses...</i>

20:22.117 --> 20:24.847
<i>... celebrated by a generation</i>
<i>of Dutch painters...</i>

20:25.053 --> 20:29.080
<i>... suggest restraint and discretion.</i>

20:35.731 --> 20:39.098
<i>The officers of these ships</i>
<i>of exploration and trade...</i>

20:39.301 --> 20:41.599
<i>... would return from their long</i>
<i>voyages...</i>

20:41.803 --> 20:44.101
<i>... share in the goods</i>
<i>they had acquired...</i>

20:44.540 --> 20:48.704
<i>... and discuss the wonders</i>
<i>they had encountered.</i>

20:54.950 --> 20:58.909
<i>Holland prospered</i>
<i>in its freedom of thought.</i>

21:12.067 --> 21:15.525
<i>In Italy, Galileo</i>
<i>had announced other worlds.</i>

21:15.737 --> 21:19.696
<i>Giordano Bruno had speculated</i>
<i>on intelligent life elsewhere.</i>

21:19.908 --> 21:23.400
<i>For this they were</i>
<i>made to suffer brutally.</i>

21:25.013 --> 21:28.073
<i>But in Holland, the astronomer</i>
<i>Christiaan Huygens...</i>

21:28.283 --> 21:32.811
<i>... who strongly supported both ideas,</i>
<i>was showered with honors.</i>

21:35.057 --> 21:38.857
<i>Christiaan was the son</i>
<i>of Constantin Huygens.</i>

21:40.329 --> 21:42.820
<i>The elder Huygens</i>
<i>distinguished himself...</i>

21:43.031 --> 21:46.330
<i>... as a master diplomat of the age,</i>
<i>a man of letters...</i>

21:46.535 --> 21:50.596
<i>... a close friend and translator</i>
<i>of the English poet, John Donne.</i>

21:53.008 --> 21:57.945
<i>Constantin was also an accomplished</i>
<i>composer and musician.</i>

22:10.726 --> 22:13.160
<i>It was Constantin who had discovered</i>
<i>a young painter...</i>

22:13.362 --> 22:15.353
<i>... named Rembrandt van Rijn...</i>

22:15.564 --> 22:18.897
<i>... in several of whose works</i>
<i>he subsequently appears.</i>

22:19.968 --> 22:21.868
<i>He opened the doors of his house...</i>

22:22.070 --> 22:23.935
<i>... to artists, musicians, writers...</i>

22:24.139 --> 22:26.539
<i>... statesmen and scientists.</i>

22:27.309 --> 22:29.334
<i>A feast of goods and ideas...</i>

22:29.544 --> 22:32.377
<i>... from all over the world</i>
<i>awaited them.</i>

22:34.750 --> 22:37.548
<i>The philosopher Descartes,</i>
<i>who visited him here...</i>

22:37.753 --> 22:39.448
<i>... said of Constantin Huygens...</i>

22:39.655 --> 22:42.317
<i>..."I could not believe</i>
<i>that a single mind...</i>

22:42.524 --> 22:45.254
<i>... could occupy itself</i>
<i>with so many things...</i>

22:45.460 --> 22:48.759
<i>... and acquit itself so well</i>
<i>in all of them."</i>

22:49.798 --> 22:52.232
<i>He even excelled</i>
<i>at the art of parenthood.</i>

22:52.434 --> 22:54.698
<i>He was a tender and loving father.</i>

22:54.903 --> 22:58.395
<i>His son, Christiaan, flourished</i>
<i>in this rich environment...</i>

22:58.607 --> 23:02.008
<i>... demonstrating extraordinary talents</i>
<i>for languages, drawing...</i>

23:02.210 --> 23:06.010
<i>... law, science, engineering</i>
<i>mathematics and music.</i>

23:09.685 --> 23:12.813
<i>"The world is my country," he said...</i>

23:13.021 --> 23:16.047
<i>..."science my religion."</i>

23:21.163 --> 23:24.394
<i>Light was the motif of the age...</i>

23:24.599 --> 23:28.763
<i>... the symbolic enlightenment of</i>
<i>freedom of thought and religion...</i>

23:28.970 --> 23:32.235
<i>... the light that suffused</i>
<i>the paintings of the time...</i>

23:32.441 --> 23:35.706
<i>... and light as an object</i>
<i>of scientific study.</i>

23:36.011 --> 23:38.946
<i>The microscope was invented in Holland</i>
<i>at this time...</i>

23:39.147 --> 23:42.981
<i>... and became</i>
<i>a drawing-room curiosity.</i>

23:43.985 --> 23:46.180
<i>Its inventor was a friend</i>
<i>of Christiaan Huygens...</i>

23:46.388 --> 23:48.481
<i>... a man named Anton Leeuwenhoek.</i>

23:58.066 --> 24:00.796
<i>The first microscopes</i>
<i>were developed from...</i>

24:01.002 --> 24:03.129
<i>... magnifying glasses</i>
<i>used by drapers...</i>

24:03.338 --> 24:06.569
<i>... to examine the quality of cloth.</i>

24:13.215 --> 24:14.705
<i>Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...</i>

24:14.916 --> 24:17.646
<i>... are the grandfathers of much of</i>
<i>modern medicine.</i>

24:19.121 --> 24:22.113
<i>Because, to his amazement...</i>

24:22.324 --> 24:24.952
<i>... Leeuwenhoek discovered a
<i>universe...</i></i>

24:25.160 --> 24:26.650
<i>... in a drop of water:</i>

24:26.862 --> 24:30.730
<i>The microbes, which he described</i>
<i>as "animalcules"...</i>

24:30.932 --> 24:33.492
<i>... and thought "cute."</i>

24:41.643 --> 24:43.338
<i>Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...</i>

24:43.545 --> 24:46.309
<i>... were among the first people to see</i>
<i>human sperm cells...</i>

24:46.515 --> 24:50.417
<i>... a hitherto hidden microcosm</i>
<i>of the human life cycle.</i>

24:51.486 --> 24:54.614
<i>Leeuwenhoek had discovered</i>
<i>the microbial world.</i>

24:55.190 --> 24:58.648
<i>Huygens had argued</i>
<i>from his telescopic observations...</i>

24:58.860 --> 25:00.885
<i>... that Mars was another world...</i>

25:01.096 --> 25:04.088
<i>... and probably, an inhabited one.</i>

25:10.338 --> 25:12.829
<i>What a waste of a planet,</i>
<i>he thought...</i>

25:13.041 --> 25:15.475
<i>... if Mars were barren.</i>

25:18.213 --> 25:21.580
<i>So the</i> Viking <i>search</i>
<i>for microbes on Mars...</i>

25:21.783 --> 25:25.742
<i>... can be traced directly back</i>
<i>to Huygens and Leeuwenhoek...</i>

25:25.954 --> 25:28.422
<i>... in 17th-century Holland.</i>

25:32.961 --> 25:36.419
<i>The telescope and the microscope</i>
<i>developed here...</i>

25:36.631 --> 25:39.395
<i>... represent an extension</i>
<i>of human vision...</i>

25:39.601 --> 25:42.001
<i>... to the realms of the very small...</i>

25:42.204 --> 25:44.229
<i>... and the very large.</i>

25:47.475 --> 25:51.309
<i>Our observations of atoms</i>
<i>and galaxies...</i>

25:51.513 --> 25:54.414
<i>... were launched</i>
<i>in this time and place.</i>

25:58.053 --> 26:00.521
<i>From the bending of light</i>
<i>through a lens...</i>

26:00.722 --> 26:02.519
<i>... Huygens advanced the idea...</i>

26:02.724 --> 26:05.215
<i>... that light was a kind of wave.</i>

26:05.427 --> 26:07.395
<i>He ground and polished lenses...</i>

26:07.596 --> 26:10.997
<i>... for the successively larger</i>
<i>telescopes he constructed...</i>

26:11.199 --> 26:14.532
<i>... although it did take him</i>
<i>a time to figure out...</i>

26:14.736 --> 26:16.727
<i>... how to use them properly.</i>

26:26.147 --> 26:28.638
<i>Huygens was the first person</i>
<i>to see a surface feature...</i>

26:28.850 --> 26:30.408
<i>... on the planet Mars.</i>

26:30.886 --> 26:32.649
<i>He was the first person</i>
<i>to speculate...</i>

26:33.355 --> 26:35.653
<i>... that Venus is completely</i>
<i>covered with clouds.</i>

26:36.458 --> 26:40.360
<i>He was the first person to understand</i>
<i>the nature of the rings of Saturn.</i>

26:40.562 --> 26:42.655
<i>"Saturn is surrounded," he wrote...</i>

26:42.864 --> 26:44.491
<i>..."by a thin, flat ring...</i>

26:44.699 --> 26:48.191
<i>... which nowhere touches</i>
<i>the body of the planet."</i>

26:59.481 --> 27:01.312
<i>His discoveries with the telescope...</i>

27:01.516 --> 27:04.280
<i>... who by themselves</i>
<i>have ensured his place...</i>

27:04.486 --> 27:07.080
<i>... in the history</i>
<i>of human accomplishment.</i>

27:15.797 --> 27:19.392
<i>Huygens was the discoverer of Titan...</i>

27:19.601 --> 27:21.865
<i>... the largest moon of Saturn.</i>

27:28.810 --> 27:32.871
<i>The immense size and changing clouds</i>
<i>of Jupiter entranced him.</i>

27:36.251 --> 27:38.515
<i>Astronomers, as well as navigators...</i>

27:38.720 --> 27:42.622
<i>... need accurate clocks to time</i>
<i>the movement of the heavens.</i>

27:42.824 --> 27:46.191
<i>Huygens was the inventor</i>
<i>of many precision timepieces...</i>

27:46.394 --> 27:48.794
<i>... including the pendulum clock.</i>

27:56.938 --> 28:01.034
<i>To illustrate the sun-centered</i>
<i>universe of Copernicus...</i>

28:01.242 --> 28:04.871
<i>... he built computers that reproduced</i>
<i>the clockwork of the heavens...</i>

28:05.647 --> 28:07.808
<i>... from Mercury to Saturn.</i>

28:13.154 --> 28:15.816
<i>The machines he designed, he signed...</i>

28:16.024 --> 28:19.016
<i>..."Christiaan Huygens, inventor."</i>

28:21.629 --> 28:23.597
<i>He was delighted that</i>
<i>the Copernican system...</i>

28:23.798 --> 28:26.289
<i>... was widely accepted</i>
<i>in everyday life in Holland...</i>

28:26.534 --> 28:30.402
<i>... and acknowledged by astronomers,</i>
<i>except those, he wrote...</i>

28:30.605 --> 28:33.403
<i>... who "were a bit slow-witted or</i>
<i>under the superstitions...</i>

28:33.608 --> 28:37.305
<i>... imposed by merely human authority.</i>

28:39.881 --> 28:43.908
Across the sea of space...

28:44.352 --> 28:46.343
...the stars...

28:46.955 --> 28:48.889
...are other suns."

28:49.090 --> 28:52.651
A point which Huygens appreciated
perfectly well.

28:53.628 --> 28:58.565
He reasoned that if
our planetary system...

28:58.867 --> 29:02.064
...involved the sun
and planets going around it...

29:02.270 --> 29:05.728
...that those other suns should
likewise have a retinue...

29:05.940 --> 29:07.669
...of planets going around them...

29:07.876 --> 29:11.812
...and also that many of the other
planets were inhabited.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.048
He set forth these conclusions...

29:14.249 --> 29:17.241
...in a remarkable book...

29:17.452 --> 29:20.114
...bearing the triumphant title...

29:20.321 --> 29:23.757
<i>... The Celestial Worlds Discovered.</i>

29:23.958 --> 29:25.425
The subtitle is...

29:25.627 --> 29:27.686
..."Conjectures Concerning...

29:27.896 --> 29:32.731
...the Inhabitants, Plants
and Productions...

29:32.934 --> 29:36.199
...of the Worlds in the Planets."

29:37.205 --> 29:41.039
He wrote this book sometime shortly
before his death...

29:41.242 --> 29:45.008
...in the year 1690, in this study.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.280
By and large...

29:53.855 --> 29:56.915
...he imagined that the environments
of the other planets...

29:57.125 --> 29:59.923
...and also the inhabitants
of the other planets...

30:00.128 --> 30:04.588
...were pretty much like those
of 17 th-century Europe.

30:04.999 --> 30:07.194
I wonder if he imagined...

30:07.402 --> 30:10.132
<i>... traveling to those other worlds</i>
<i>which he had been...</i>

30:10.338 --> 30:12.636
<i>... the first to examine close-up...</i>

30:12.841 --> 30:14.775
<i>... through the telescope.</i>

30:15.410 --> 30:19.176
<i>Perhaps he dreamt that voyages</i>
<i>of discovery to the planets...</i>

30:19.380 --> 30:23.077
<i>... would one day be like the</i>
<i>voyages of geographical discovery...</i>

30:23.284 --> 30:25.718
<i>... in his time and place.</i>

30:28.189 --> 30:31.317
He did imagine of
extraterrestrial beings...

30:32.527 --> 30:35.428
..."that their whole bodies,
and every part of them...

30:35.630 --> 30:39.191
...may be quite distinct
and different from ours.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.392
"Tis a very ridiculous opinion,"
he says...

30:42.604 --> 30:44.731
..."that it is impossible
a rational soul...

30:44.939 --> 30:48.397
...should dwell in any other shape
than ours."

30:49.144 --> 30:51.442
You could be smart,
Huygens was saying...

30:51.646 --> 30:53.375
...even if you looked funny.

30:53.681 --> 30:55.546
But he then went on to argue...

30:55.750 --> 30:58.116
...that they didn't look
all that funny...

30:58.319 --> 31:00.787
...that extraterrestrial beings
must have...

31:00.989 --> 31:03.389
...hands and feet and stand upright...

31:03.591 --> 31:05.456
...and have writing and geometry.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.128
Even that the four
moons of Jupiter...

31:08.329 --> 31:12.459
...the Galilean satellites,
were there in order to provide...

31:12.667 --> 31:15.329
...a navigational aid,
a convenience...

31:15.537 --> 31:18.097
...for the sailors
in the Jovian oceans.

31:18.439 --> 31:21.033
Well, maybe.

31:21.242 --> 31:23.176
(WOOD CREAKS)

31:28.116 --> 31:32.246
<i>That bit of speculation</i>
<i>is probably wrong, but...</i>

31:32.453 --> 31:34.887
<i>... think of a citizen</i>
<i>of the 17th century...</i>

31:35.089 --> 31:37.557
<i>... with the courage and insight...</i>

31:37.759 --> 31:41.422
<i>... to imagine other landscapes</i>
<i>and other intelligences.</i>

31:41.629 --> 31:44.359
<i>Might there really be mariners...</i>

31:44.566 --> 31:46.727
<i>... on a million other worlds?</i>

31:49.771 --> 31:51.671
<i>In his book, Huygens wrote:</i>

31:51.873 --> 31:55.832
<i>"What a wonderful and amazing scheme</i>
<i>have we here...</i>

31:56.044 --> 31:59.343
<i>... of the magnificent vastness</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

31:59.547 --> 32:03.210
<i>So many suns. So many earths.</i>

32:03.418 --> 32:07.616
<i>And every one of them</i>
<i>stocked with so many animals.</i>

32:07.889 --> 32:10.289
<i>Adorned with so many seas.</i>

32:10.491 --> 32:13.085
<i>How must our wonder and admiration</i>
<i>be increased...</i>

32:13.595 --> 32:17.895
<i>... when we consider the prodigious</i>
<i>distance and multitude...</i>

32:18.099 --> 32:19.396
<i>... of the stars?"</i>

32:26.241 --> 32:30.007
<i>The Dutch called their ships</i>
<i>"flying boats"...</i>

32:30.211 --> 32:33.112
<i>... and the</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft</i>
<i>are their descendants...</i>

32:33.314 --> 32:35.612
<i>... true flying boats...</i>

32:35.817 --> 32:38.547
<i>... bound for the stars,</i>
<i>and on the way...</i>

32:38.753 --> 32:42.052
<i>... exploring some of those worlds</i>
<i>which Christiaan Huygens...</i>

32:42.257 --> 32:43.690
<i>... a man from Earth...</i>

32:43.891 --> 32:46.758
<i>... knew and loved so well.</i>

32:48.630 --> 32:50.495
Travelers' tales:

32:50.698 --> 32:52.097
A main commodity...

32:52.300 --> 32:56.498
...returned by those sailing ship
voyages of centuries ago...

32:56.704 --> 32:59.104
...were stories.

32:59.440 --> 33:03.774
<i>Stories of alien lands</i>
<i>and exotic creatures.</i>

33:07.215 --> 33:10.878
<i>They evoked a sense of wonder</i>
<i>and stimulated further exploration.</i>

33:11.085 --> 33:13.679
<i>Those tales of strange worlds...</i>

33:13.888 --> 33:17.119
<i>... enabled some Europeans</i>
<i>to see themselves anew.</i>

33:17.558 --> 33:20.994
<i>There had been accounts</i>
<i>of headless people, foot people...</i>

33:21.195 --> 33:22.628
<i>... cyclops people.</i>

33:23.665 --> 33:26.566
<i>Now the Dutch brought back</i>
<i>fantastic stories...</i>

33:26.801 --> 33:28.564
<i>... of giant hunters...</i>

33:29.504 --> 33:31.131
<i>... dodoes...</i>

33:31.639 --> 33:33.698
<i>... rhinos...</i>

33:34.208 --> 33:35.732
<i>... leopards...</i>

33:35.943 --> 33:39.208
<i>... and other creatures.</i>

33:42.016 --> 33:46.612
Modern voyagers
also return travelers' tales:

33:46.954 --> 33:51.891
<i>Tales of a world shattered</i>
<i>like a crystal sphere.</i>

33:52.660 --> 33:55.151
<i>A place where the ground is covered...</i>

33:55.363 --> 33:59.925
<i>... with what looks like</i>
<i>a network of giant cobwebs.</i>

34:03.304 --> 34:06.364
<i>A world with an underground ocean.</i>

34:07.709 --> 34:10.644
<i>Tiny moons shaped like potatoes.</i>

34:12.046 --> 34:14.742
<i>A yellow and red pockmarked land...</i>

34:14.949 --> 34:16.780
<i>... with lakes of molten sulfur...</i>

34:16.984 --> 34:20.977
<i>... and volcanic eruptions</i>
<i>300 kilometers high.</i>

34:24.759 --> 34:26.386
<i>And a place called Jupiter...</i>

34:26.594 --> 34:29.927
<i>... so large that a thousand Earths</i>
<i>would fit inside.</i>

34:30.131 --> 34:33.362
<i>There are no mountains, valleys,</i>
<i>volcanoes or rivers there.</i>

34:33.568 --> 34:36.298
<i>Just a vast ocean of gas and clouds.</i>

34:36.504 --> 34:40.167
<i>Everything we see on Jupiter</i>
<i>is floating in the sky.</i>

34:43.244 --> 34:46.577
But there's much that is fascinating
about Jupiter.

34:46.914 --> 34:50.350
As the solar system condensed
out of interstellar gas and dust...

34:50.551 --> 34:54.988
...Jupiter acquired most of the matter
not ejected into interstellar space...

34:55.189 --> 34:58.488
...and which didn't fall inwards
to form the sun.

34:58.693 --> 35:03.596
Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen
and helium, just like the sun...

35:03.798 --> 35:08.394
...and had Jupiter been a few dozen
times more massive...

35:08.603 --> 35:10.070
...the matter in it...

35:10.271 --> 35:14.708
...might have undergone thermonuclear
reactions in the interior...

35:14.909 --> 35:19.141
...and Jupiter would have begun
to shine by its own light.

35:19.347 --> 35:23.340
Jupiter is a star that failed.

35:23.684 --> 35:25.083
Had it become a star...

35:25.286 --> 35:27.846
...we would be living
in a double-star system...

35:28.055 --> 35:30.148
...with two suns in our sky...

35:30.358 --> 35:34.021
...and the nights
would come more rarely.

35:34.228 --> 35:38.324
Deep below the clouds of Jupiter, the
weights of the layers of atmosphere...

35:38.533 --> 35:41.400
...produce pressures
which are much greater...

35:41.602 --> 35:44.400
...than any that are found
anywhere on the Earth.

35:44.639 --> 35:46.539
The clouds are this layer here.

35:46.741 --> 35:49.801
The deep interior
is this high-pressure place.

35:50.011 --> 35:51.638
The pressure is so large...

35:51.846 --> 35:56.374
...that electrons are squeezed off
hydrogen atoms, producing...

35:57.385 --> 36:01.446
...liquid metallic hydrogen.

36:01.756 --> 36:06.455
But at the very core of Jupiter,
there may be a lump...

36:06.661 --> 36:07.719
...of rock and iron...

36:07.929 --> 36:12.366
...a giant Earth-like world
under astonishing pressures...

36:12.567 --> 36:17.197
...hidden forever at the center
of the largest planet.

36:19.507 --> 36:20.974
Just before <i>Voyager...</i>

36:21.175 --> 36:25.942
...encountered Jupiter, you could see
that giant planet at night...

36:26.147 --> 36:31.084
...shining in the sky as our ancestors
have for the last million years.

36:31.385 --> 36:34.115
And on my way to study
the <i>Voyager</i> data...

36:34.322 --> 36:36.790
...arriving at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

36:36.991 --> 36:40.085
...I thought that Jupiter
would never be the same again.

36:40.294 --> 36:44.253
Never again just a point of light
in the night sky...

36:44.465 --> 36:48.799
...but forever after, a place
to be explored and known.

36:51.939 --> 36:56.467
<i>To see the first close-up images</i>
<i>of a world never before known...</i>

36:56.677 --> 37:00.875
<i>... is a great joy in the life</i>
<i>of a planetary scientist.</i>

37:03.117 --> 37:07.520
<i>In the early morning hours of</i>
<i>July 9th, 1979, on the real-time...</i>

37:07.722 --> 37:10.691
<i>... television monitors at the Jet</i>
<i>Propulsion Laboratory...</i>

37:10.892 --> 37:14.020
<i>... we began to learn</i>
<i>about a world called Europa.</i>

37:14.262 --> 37:16.321
<i>These are the modern explorers.</i>

37:16.531 --> 37:18.260
<i>Men and women trained...</i>

37:18.466 --> 37:21.401
<i>... in astronomy, physics,</i>
<i>geology or engineering.</i>

37:21.602 --> 37:24.571
<i>Many devoting five to eight years</i>
<i>to this single mission.</i>

37:24.772 --> 37:28.333
JPL MAN: Cassen's model for Europa
says if you start with a liquid...

37:28.543 --> 37:31.307
...you can put in enough energy
to keep it liquid.

37:32.713 --> 37:36.774
But Cassen said in order for there
to be enough heating going on...

37:36.984 --> 37:41.216
...you had to start the heating
before Europa basically cooled off.

37:42.623 --> 37:44.955
But what about relief
from the cracks?

37:48.129 --> 37:51.963
- and Europa there's a twin,
a pair there...

37:52.967 --> 37:56.300
<i>You can't look at a world</i>
<i>so different from ours...</i>

37:56.504 --> 37:58.563
<i>... without wondering</i>
<i>how both were made.</i>

37:58.773 --> 38:00.798
Just rotate it out a little bit.

38:02.243 --> 38:06.111
Voyager <i>presented us with six new</i>
<i>worlds in the Jupiter system alone.</i>

38:07.081 --> 38:11.142
<i>The more you learn about other worlds,</i>
<i>the better you understand our own.</i>

38:11.352 --> 38:16.289
<i>We speculate, criticize, argue,</i>
<i>calculate, reflect and wonder.</i>

38:16.624 --> 38:20.390
<i>We return again to the astonishing</i>
<i>data, and slowly...</i>

38:20.595 --> 38:22.961
<i>... we begin to understand.</i>

38:34.041 --> 38:37.408
<i>The Dutch sailing ships brought back</i>
<i>rare and valuable commodities...</i>

38:37.612 --> 38:39.603
<i>... from the new worlds they visited.</i>

38:39.814 --> 38:41.748
<i>Our</i> Voyager <i>spaceships...</i>

38:41.949 --> 38:44.611
<i>... return rare and valuable</i>
<i>information...</i>

38:44.819 --> 38:48.550
<i>... to computerized wharves on this</i>
<i>shore of the sea of space.</i>

38:49.323 --> 38:54.226
<i>Here the data are stored,</i>
<i>enhanced, processed and treasured.</i>

38:54.929 --> 38:58.524
<i>Maps of alien lands will be generated</i>
<i>from this information.</i>

38:58.733 --> 39:02.829
<i>In this electric warehouse</i>
<i>are tens of thousands of images...</i>

39:03.037 --> 39:05.870
<i>... of previously unknown worlds.</i>

39:08.042 --> 39:11.443
<i>How does a picture from</i>
<i>the outer solar system get to us?</i>

39:11.646 --> 39:15.013
<i>Sunlight shines on Europa,</i>
<i>and is reflected back to space...</i>

39:15.216 --> 39:17.047
<i>... where some strikes the phosphors...</i>

39:17.251 --> 39:20.516
<i>... of the</i> Voyager <i>television cameras,</i>
<i>generating an image.</i>

39:20.721 --> 39:23.952
<i>The image is radioed back</i>
<i>across the immense distance...</i>

39:24.158 --> 39:26.319
<i>... of half a billion kilometers...</i>

39:26.527 --> 39:29.724
<i>... to a radio telescope on Earth.</i>
<i>One in Australia, say.</i>

39:29.930 --> 39:32.694
<i>The telescope then passes</i>
<i>the information...</i>

39:32.900 --> 39:35.892
<i>... via communications satellite</i>
<i>in Earth orbit...</i>

39:36.103 --> 39:37.798
<i>... to Southern California.</i>

39:38.005 --> 39:41.964
<i>There, it's transmitted</i>
<i>by a set of microwave relay towers...</i>

39:42.176 --> 39:45.543
<i>... to a computer</i>
<i>at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...</i>

39:46.380 --> 39:49.281
<i>... and there it is processed.</i>

39:56.557 --> 39:59.151
<i>The picture is like</i>
<i>a newspaper wire photo...</i>

39:59.360 --> 40:03.262
<i>... made of a million individual dots</i>
<i>of differing shades of gray...</i>

40:03.464 --> 40:06.194
<i>... so fine and close together</i>
<i>that at a distance...</i>

40:06.400 --> 40:09.233
<i>... the constituent dots</i>
<i>are invisible.</i>

40:09.437 --> 40:12.065
<i>We see only</i>
<i>their cumulative effect.</i>

40:13.307 --> 40:16.367
<i>The information specifies</i>
<i>how bright or dark...</i>

40:16.577 --> 40:18.204
<i>... each dot is to be.</i>

40:18.412 --> 40:21.472
<i>After processing, the dots</i>
<i>are stored on a magnetic disk...</i>

40:21.682 --> 40:24.116
<i>... something like a phonograph record.</i>

40:24.351 --> 40:28.185
<i>By this day, there were already 11,000</i>
<i>pictures from</i> Voyager 2 <i>in our...</i>

40:28.389 --> 40:30.050
<i>... electronic library.</i>

40:31.058 --> 40:34.789
Finally, the end product
of this remarkable set...

40:34.995 --> 40:37.225
...of links and relays...

40:38.332 --> 40:41.927
...is a hard copy which comes
out of this machine showing...

40:42.336 --> 40:45.271
...in this case,
the wonders of Europa...

40:45.473 --> 40:49.705
...which were recorded for the first
time in human history, today.

40:50.244 --> 40:53.270
It is absolutely astonishing.

40:54.248 --> 40:58.810
<i>Voyager 1 got very good pictures
of the other three big moons...</i>

40:59.019 --> 41:02.386
...Galilean satellites of Jupiter,
but not of Europa.

41:02.590 --> 41:05.525
It was left to <i>Voyager 2 today...</i>

41:05.726 --> 41:08.820
...to get the first
close-up pictures of Europa...

41:09.029 --> 41:12.556
...where we see things that are only
a few kilometers across.

41:12.767 --> 41:15.930
At first glance, it looks like
nothing so much as...

41:16.137 --> 41:21.074
...the canal network of Mars that
Lowell imagined existed on that planet.

41:21.542 --> 41:26.479
We see an amazing, intricate network
of crisscrossing...

41:26.747 --> 41:29.045
...straight and curved lines.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.309
Are these straight lines ridges?

41:31.519 --> 41:32.611
Are they troughs?

41:32.820 --> 41:35.846
Is it connected with plate tectonics
on the Earth?

41:36.056 --> 41:40.356
How does it illuminate the other
satellites of the Jovian system?

41:40.661 --> 41:43.960
At this moment,
the vaunted technology...

41:44.165 --> 41:46.463
...has produced something
astonishing.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.965
But it remains for...

41:49.470 --> 41:53.839
...the limitations and cleverness
of another device...

41:54.041 --> 41:56.976
...the human brain, to figure it out.

41:59.146 --> 42:03.207
<i>Fortunately, we have plenty</i>
<i>of pictures to help us.</i>

42:04.185 --> 42:08.212
<i>What about Gene's idea of geysers</i>
<i>down the troughs?</i>

42:08.422 --> 42:10.549
<i>Geysers down the troughs?</i>

42:11.759 --> 42:13.818
LARRY SODERBLOM:
You need a mechanism to drive it.

42:14.028 --> 42:17.327
SAGAN:
<i>Larry Soderblom,</i> Voyager <i>imaging team.</i>

42:17.531 --> 42:22.434
LARRY: An idea was proposed a while
ago that we might have a sort of...

42:22.636 --> 42:24.831
...champagne-bottle model.
And that's...

42:25.039 --> 42:28.372
You seal the crust and have liquid
underneath that solid crust.

42:28.876 --> 42:32.312
Do you have then a condition which
is an explosive effervescence?

42:32.646 --> 42:34.807
SAGAN:
<i>Lonnie Lane, deputy project scientist.</i>

42:36.083 --> 42:39.814
You have enough resolution
in some of these pictures that...

42:40.020 --> 42:42.454
...you don't see anything
spread laterally.

42:42.656 --> 42:45.284
Do we have the high-resolution piece?

42:45.559 --> 42:48.153
- It was right here.
- There it is.

42:48.362 --> 42:51.297
We'll pick out the relief,
and if we're going to see...

42:51.498 --> 42:52.795
...the things we recognize...

42:53.000 --> 42:55.696
SAGAN: <i>Weeks after the pictures</i>
<i>from Europa were received...</i>

42:55.903 --> 42:57.996
<i>... we were still debating</i>
<i>what was in them.</i>

42:58.205 --> 43:01.174
It's as if we almost got to the...

43:02.009 --> 43:03.442
Look at the mesas here.

43:04.044 --> 43:07.207
We almost got the resolution
needed to see the craters.

43:07.414 --> 43:10.850
The craters which would last
indefinitely on a crust this thin.

43:11.051 --> 43:12.575
Apart from the réseaus...

43:12.786 --> 43:17.621
...there's a set of very fine
small dots, markings...

43:17.825 --> 43:20.020
...mostly in the mottled terrain.

43:20.227 --> 43:23.822
Like those guys. Do you think
those are...

43:24.031 --> 43:27.489
...sites of out gassing, calderas,
fumaroles, solfataras?

43:27.701 --> 43:30.829
I don't know, but I'll tell you
one thing I just found...

43:33.073 --> 43:34.472
Look right here.

43:36.043 --> 43:37.408
It disappeared.

43:38.512 --> 43:40.673
See the central peak?

43:40.881 --> 43:42.781
See the little hole?

43:45.452 --> 43:47.920
I think it's an impact crater.
Look at the central peak.

43:48.122 --> 43:50.215
SAGAN:
There are almost no impact craters.

43:50.424 --> 43:52.051
Wait, we just found one.

43:52.259 --> 43:53.487
Almost none.

43:54.595 --> 43:58.725
Therefore, finding one which is
alleged to be the exception...

43:58.933 --> 44:01.925
...maybe it's not the exception,
but something else.

44:02.136 --> 44:06.300
Perhaps, but you asked about those
little holes that we can't make out.

44:08.442 --> 44:11.809
The big craters go away by some
rheological deformation...

44:12.012 --> 44:14.845
...and the little ones stay
but are out of our resolution.

44:15.049 --> 44:18.951
That's because they're one-tenth
the depth of the rigid crust.

44:19.153 --> 44:20.347
Well, maybe.

44:21.588 --> 44:24.284
SAGAN: <i>Computer processing of</i>
<i>the pictures has revealed...</i>

44:24.491 --> 44:27.722
<i>... a few features on Europa</i>
<i>which seem to be impact craters.</i>

44:27.928 --> 44:28.986
<i>But something...</i>

44:29.196 --> 44:31.494
<i>... has wiped out the big craters.</i>

44:31.699 --> 44:34.031
<i>Computer processing</i>
<i>also played a major role...</i>

44:34.234 --> 44:38.261
<i>... in an amazing</i> Voyager <i>discovery</i>
<i>made on the moon next to Europa...</i>

44:38.472 --> 44:41.236
<i>... a world called lo.</i>

44:42.776 --> 44:46.075
<i>Even from Earth we could tell</i>
<i>that lo had a strange color.</i>

44:46.280 --> 44:49.647
<i>We knew that somehow sulfur</i>
<i>had been removed from its surface...</i>

44:49.850 --> 44:53.513
<i>... and ejected into a great</i>
<i>doughnut of gas orbiting Jupiter.</i>

44:53.721 --> 44:57.589
<i>Then</i> Voyager 1 <i>sailed close to lo.</i>

44:59.994 --> 45:04.226
<i>There were a few places on lo which</i>
<i>looked like the mouths of volcanoes...</i>

45:04.431 --> 45:06.126
<i>... but it was hard to be sure.</i>

45:07.001 --> 45:10.493
<i>Then, Linda Morabito, a member</i>
<i>of the</i> Voyager <i>navigation team...</i>

45:10.704 --> 45:13.571
<i>... used a computer</i>
<i>to enhance the edge of lo...</i>

45:13.774 --> 45:16.299
<i>... in order to bring out</i>
<i>the stars behind.</i>

45:16.510 --> 45:20.412
Four days after the <i>Voyager 1
encounter with Jupiter...</i>

45:20.614 --> 45:24.414
...I was looking at an
optical navigation frame.

45:24.618 --> 45:28.748
In enhancing this particular quadrant,
what became very evident to me...

45:28.956 --> 45:31.015
...was an anomalous crescent...

45:31.225 --> 45:34.592
...in the upper left-hand corner,
just off the limb of lo.

45:34.795 --> 45:35.989
SAGAN:
<i>What was it?</i>

45:36.196 --> 45:38.596
<i>The plume was in exactly</i>
<i>the position...</i>

45:38.799 --> 45:40.824
<i>... of one of the suspected volcanoes.</i>

45:41.235 --> 45:44.636
We realized then that
what we were observing...

45:44.838 --> 45:48.899
...was a volcanic plume and,
in fact, a volcanic eruption.

45:50.978 --> 45:55.677
SAGAN: Voyager <i>had discovered the</i>
<i>first active volcano beyond the Earth.</i>

45:58.052 --> 46:00.486
<i>We then found that lo</i>
<i>has many volcanoes.</i>

46:00.687 --> 46:03.781
<i>There are at least nine</i>
<i>intermittently active plumes...</i>

46:03.991 --> 46:06.619
<i>... and hundreds, maybe thousands,</i>
<i>of extinct ones.</i>

46:06.827 --> 46:10.820
<i>The plumes can eject sulfur</i>
<i>and other atoms off lo altogether...</i>

46:11.165 --> 46:14.726
<i>... and account for the sulfur clouds</i>
<i>surrounding Jupiter.</i>

46:15.469 --> 46:20.236
<i>Rivers of molten sulfur flow down</i>
<i>the sides of the volcanic mountains...</i>

46:20.441 --> 46:23.501
<i>... and are the probable source</i>
<i>of Io's distinctive colors.</i>

46:23.710 --> 46:28.443
<i>The volcanoes may be tapping some vast</i>
<i>underground ocean of liquid sulfur...</i>

46:28.649 --> 46:33.018
<i>... beneath a surface</i>
<i>that is only a few thousand years old.</i>

46:36.924 --> 46:40.382
<i>So far, in our voyages</i>
<i>to the outer solar system...</i>

46:40.627 --> 46:43.095
<i>... we humans have stayed home...</i>

46:43.297 --> 46:46.528
<i>... and sent robots and computers</i>
<i>to explore in our stead.</i>

46:46.733 --> 46:49.793
<i>Someday, perhaps, we'll go ourselves.</i>

46:50.904 --> 46:52.098
<i>But suppose...</i>

46:52.706 --> 46:55.641
<i>... like those Dutch sea captains</i>
<i>of the 17th century...</i>

46:55.843 --> 46:59.279
<i>... the computers aboard Voyager</i>
<i>could keep a ship's log.</i>

46:59.480 --> 47:03.576
<i>That log, a combination of the events</i>
<i>of</i> Voyagers 1 <i>and</i> 2...

47:03.784 --> 47:06.651
<i>... might read something like this:</i>

47:09.089 --> 47:13.788
<i>Day 1: After much concern</i>
<i>about provisions and instruments...</i>

47:13.994 --> 47:18.226
<i>... we successfully lift off from</i>
<i>Cape Canaveral on our long journey...</i>

47:18.432 --> 47:21.026
<i>... to the planets and the stars.</i>

47:29.443 --> 47:33.641
<i>Day 13: We have taken the first</i>
<i>photograph of the Earth and moon...</i>

47:33.847 --> 47:37.374
<i>... as worlds together in space.</i>
<i>A pretty pair.</i>

47:41.388 --> 47:44.915
<i>Day 170: A problem</i>
<i>in the deployment of the boom...</i>

47:45.125 --> 47:47.423
<i>... that supports</i>
<i>the science scan platform.</i>

47:47.628 --> 47:49.425
<i>If the problem is not solved...</i>

47:49.630 --> 47:52.224
<i>... we will be unable to take</i>
<i>most of our pictures.</i>

47:56.470 --> 48:01.407
<i>Day 207: Boom problem solved, but</i>
<i>failure of main radio transmitter.</i>

48:01.942 --> 48:04.035
<i>If the backup transmitter</i>
<i>also fails...</i>

48:04.244 --> 48:07.509
<i>... no one on Earth</i>
<i>will ever hear from us again.</i>

48:08.549 --> 48:09.743
<i>Day 215:</i>

48:09.950 --> 48:12.248
<i>We cross the orbit of Mars...</i>

48:12.452 --> 48:14.579
<i>... and enter the main asteroid belt.</i>

48:16.190 --> 48:20.456
<i>Day 570: We can now make out</i>
<i>finer detail on Jupiter...</i>

48:20.661 --> 48:24.324
<i>... than the largest telescopes</i>
<i>on Earth have ever obtained.</i>

48:29.336 --> 48:30.963
<i>Day 640:</i>

48:31.171 --> 48:34.902
<i>The cloud patterns are distinctive</i>
<i>and gorgeous.</i>

48:35.108 --> 48:36.735
<i>No painter trapped on Earth...</i>

48:36.944 --> 48:39.742
<i>... ever imagined a world</i>
<i>so strange and lovely.</i>

48:42.983 --> 48:46.510
<i>The white clouds are ammonia</i>
<i>crystals, high and cold.</i>

48:46.720 --> 48:49.450
<i>We do not know the nature</i>
<i>of the red-brown clouds.</i>

48:49.656 --> 48:52.250
<i>Maybe phosphorous or sulfur</i>
<i>as a stain.</i>

48:52.459 --> 48:56.896
<i>Perhaps organic molecules of the sort</i>
<i>that led, four billion years ago...</i>

48:57.097 --> 48:59.964
<i>... back on Earth,</i>
<i>to the origin of life.</i>

49:00.167 --> 49:02.863
<i>And what is the great red spot?</i>

49:03.370 --> 49:04.359
(COMPUTER HUMS)

49:05.639 --> 49:08.733
<i>It is an immense swirling column</i>
<i>of gas...</i>

49:08.942 --> 49:11.137
<i>... reaching high above adjacent</i>
<i>clouds.</i>

49:11.345 --> 49:14.178
<i>So large that it could hold</i>
<i>half a dozen Earths.</i>

49:14.381 --> 49:17.817
<i>Its motion hypnotizes us.</i>

49:21.588 --> 49:25.388
<i>Some think that the red spot</i>
<i>is a great spinning storm...</i>

49:25.592 --> 49:27.958
<i>... a million years old.</i>

49:31.198 --> 49:36.135
<i>Day 650: Encounter.</i>
<i>A day of wonders.</i>

49:39.339 --> 49:41.432
<i>The ship maneuvers</i>
<i>so we can take pictures...</i>

49:41.642 --> 49:44.270
<i>... of the multi-ringed basin</i>
<i>on Callisto.</i>

49:49.249 --> 49:53.777
<i>Images of the astonishing</i>
<i>lined surface of Ganymede.</i>

49:58.358 --> 50:01.088
<i>A close passage by Europa.</i>

50:03.463 --> 50:05.931
<i>And, a view of volcanic lo.</i>

50:09.703 --> 50:13.139
<i>We successfully negotiate</i>
<i>the treacherous radiation belts...</i>

50:13.340 --> 50:16.776
<i>... and accomplish</i>
<i>the ring plane crossing.</i>

50:17.911 --> 50:20.379
<i>Looking back, we marvel</i>
<i>at the rings...</i>

50:20.580 --> 50:25.347
<i>... and see the sun emerge</i>
<i>from behind the giant planet.</i>

50:30.324 --> 50:35.261
<i>We are outward bound on our mission</i>
<i>to explore the outer solar system.</i>

50:36.163 --> 50:38.154
<i>Ten thousand years from now...</i>

50:38.365 --> 50:41.892
...Voyager <i>will plunge onward</i>
<i>to the stars.</i>

50:43.036 --> 50:47.666
<i>We have made the ships</i>
<i>that sail the sea of space.</i>

50:51.545 --> 50:53.172
<i>We travel past Jupiter...</i>

50:53.380 --> 50:56.679
<i>... three quarters of a billion</i>
<i>kilometers from the sun...</i>

50:57.217 --> 51:00.243
<i>... Saturn, one and a half billion,</i>
<i>Uranus, three billion...</i>

51:00.454 --> 51:05.084
<i>... and Neptune, four and a half</i>
<i>billion kilometers away.</i>

51:08.161 --> 51:09.560
<i>In our ship of the mind...</i>

51:09.763 --> 51:14.029
<i>... we retrace the itinerary</i>
<i>of the two</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft...</i>

51:14.234 --> 51:17.931
<i>... on their journeys to Saturn</i>
<i>and beyond.</i>

51:20.006 --> 51:23.271
<i>Saturn was first glimpsed</i>
<i>through the telescope by Galileo.</i>

51:23.477 --> 51:26.412
<i>Its rings first understood by Huygens.</i>

51:26.613 --> 51:30.982
<i>But only now do we begin to penetrate</i>
<i>its deeper mysteries.</i>

51:36.957 --> 51:40.859
<i>Saturn is the second largest planet</i>
<i>in the solar system.</i>

51:41.728 --> 51:45.960
<i>Like Jupiter, it is cloud-covered,</i>
<i>and rotates once every 10 hours.</i>

51:46.166 --> 51:49.499
<i>It has a weaker magnetic field,</i>
<i>a weaker radiation belt...</i>

51:49.703 --> 51:51.967
<i>... and a grand, magnificent...</i>

51:52.172 --> 51:55.369
<i>... exquisite system of rings.</i>

51:57.077 --> 51:59.841
<i>The rings are composed of billions</i>
<i>of tiny moons...</i>

52:00.046 --> 52:02.844
<i>... each circling Saturn</i>
<i>in its own orbit.</i>

52:03.550 --> 52:07.782
<i>The biggest gap in the rings</i>
<i>is called the Cassini Division...</i>

52:07.988 --> 52:11.082
<i>... after the colleague of Huygens</i>
<i>who first discovered it.</i>

52:12.025 --> 52:13.583
<i>There are many other gaps...</i>

52:13.794 --> 52:16.820
<i>... each produced by the periodic</i>
<i>gravitational tugs...</i>

52:17.030 --> 52:19.021
<i>... of one of the larger outer moons.</i>

52:36.149 --> 52:38.640
<i>From just beneath the ring plane...</i>

52:38.852 --> 52:42.515
<i>... we see a sky full of moons.</i>

53:02.342 --> 53:06.938
<i>Within the rings,</i>
<i>the individual moons become visible.</i>

53:08.815 --> 53:12.376
<i>They are orbiting chunks</i>
<i>of snow and ice...</i>

53:13.720 --> 53:16.086
<i>... each perhaps a meter across.</i>

53:21.628 --> 53:25.223
<i>In young parts of the ring system,</i>
<i>there hasn't been enough time...</i>

53:25.432 --> 53:29.801
<i>... for collisions to round the edges</i>
<i>of these fragments...</i>

53:30.003 --> 53:32.494
<i>... the snowballs of Saturn.</i>

54:18.518 --> 54:23.285
<i>Far from the rings,</i>
<i>bathed in its red light...</i>

54:24.591 --> 54:28.357
<i>... we encounter Saturn's immense</i>
<i>cloud-covered moon...</i>

54:28.562 --> 54:29.790
<i>... Titan.</i>

54:42.742 --> 54:45.176
<i>It has an atmosphere</i>
<i>denser than that of Mars...</i>

54:45.979 --> 54:47.810
<i>... and a thick layer of red clouds...</i>

54:48.014 --> 54:51.575
<i>... which are probably composed</i>
<i>of complex organic molecules...</i>

54:51.785 --> 54:55.448
<i>... produced by solar ultraviolet light</i>
<i>and other energy sources...</i>

54:55.655 --> 54:57.350
<i>... from the methane-rich air.</i>

55:04.698 --> 55:07.963
<i>No ship from Earth</i>
<i>has ever penetrated those clouds...</i>

55:08.168 --> 55:12.730
<i>... and viewed, close-up,</i>
<i>the surface of this tantalizing world.</i>

55:19.079 --> 55:22.446
<i>It seems likely that the ground</i>
<i>is covered, encrusted...</i>

55:22.649 --> 55:26.710
<i>... with organic molecules</i>
<i>raining from the sky.</i>

55:32.692 --> 55:36.992
<i>There may be volcanoes</i>
<i>and valleys of ice...</i>

55:37.197 --> 55:39.995
<i>... and, just perhaps...</i>

55:40.200 --> 55:45.069
<i>... hiding in the warm places,</i>
<i>some very different kind of life.</i>

55:53.146 --> 55:55.205
<i>Near an ice cliff of Titan...</i>

55:55.415 --> 55:58.782
<i>... through a rare break</i>
<i>in the clouds of organic molecules...</i>

55:58.985 --> 56:03.820
<i>... we can see, looming and lovely,</i>
<i>the ringed planet, Saturn.</i>

56:05.291 --> 56:09.625
<i>It is a view that will still be</i>
<i>appreciated centuries from now...</i>

56:09.863 --> 56:12.024
<i>... by our descendants,</i>
<i>who will know it well.</i>

56:12.232 --> 56:14.632
<i>As well as we have come to know...</i>

56:14.834 --> 56:18.167
<i>... Hudson's Bay and the Barents Sea...</i>

56:18.371 --> 56:22.364
<i>... Indonesia, and Australia</i>
<i>and New York.</i>

56:23.209 --> 56:27.805
<i>They will look back to when Titan was</i>
<i>first seen by</i> Voyager <i>spaceships...</i>

56:28.014 --> 56:31.177
<i>... on their epic journeys</i>
<i>past the giant planets...</i>

56:31.384 --> 56:33.079
<i>... out of the solar system...</i>

56:33.286 --> 56:37.086
<i>... to the great dark</i>
<i>between the stars.</i>

56:54.541 --> 56:56.566
Since <i>Cosmos</i> was first shown...

56:56.776 --> 57:00.678
<i>...Voyager</i> spacecraft have explored
the systems of the planets...

57:00.880 --> 57:03.644
...Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune...

57:03.850 --> 57:08.719
...and have now passed the outermost
planets on their way to the stars.

57:09.155 --> 57:12.852
We inserted the flavor of those
encounters in our captain's log.

57:13.626 --> 57:15.651
<i>But with image processing...</i>

57:15.862 --> 57:20.094
<i>... we've been able to reconstruct</i>
<i>astonishing movies...</i>

57:20.366 --> 57:22.027
<i>... of some of these worlds.</i>

57:22.235 --> 57:25.636
<i>Here, for example, is Jupiter,</i>
<i>with its great red spot.</i>

57:27.207 --> 57:30.472
<i>And volcanic lo, spinning before us.</i>

57:31.478 --> 57:36.415
<i>Icy Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn,</i>
<i>on much of which, somehow...</i>

57:36.883 --> 57:38.817
<i>... the craters have melted.</i>

57:40.019 --> 57:42.385
<i>And Miranda, of Uranus.</i>

57:43.923 --> 57:46.653
<i>Austere, blue Neptune.</i>

57:48.995 --> 57:52.396
<i>Or consider Titan,</i>
<i>the giant moon of Saturn.</i>

57:52.599 --> 57:55.966
We've taken the nitrogen and methane
in its atmosphere...

57:56.169 --> 57:59.661
...irradiated it in the lab with
electrons of the sort that are...

57:59.873 --> 58:02.535
...beamed at Titan from
Saturn's magnetic field...

58:02.742 --> 58:05.438
...and we made this stuff...

58:06.045 --> 58:10.482
...which matches, almost perfectly, the
observed properties of the Titan haze.

58:10.683 --> 58:11.775
What is it?

58:11.985 --> 58:14.419
It's a mixture of
complex organic molecules.

58:14.621 --> 58:17.818
You drop some into water and,
among other things, you make...

58:18.024 --> 58:20.618
...amino acids,
the building blocks of proteins.

58:20.827 --> 58:23.762
So the starting materials of life...

58:23.963 --> 58:28.161
...are raining from the skies
of Titan, like manna from heaven.

58:28.368 --> 58:31.030
I can't wait
until the Cassini mission...

58:31.237 --> 58:35.503
...sends an entry probe
through the organic haze of Titan...

58:35.708 --> 58:37.835
...to its enigmatic surface.

58:38.244 --> 58:43.181
The <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft rush on
past the planets and to the stars...

58:43.416 --> 58:45.543
...still returning data.

58:46.085 --> 58:48.747
<i>As it left the planetary part</i>
<i>of the solar system...</i>

58:48.955 --> 58:51.219
...Voyager 1 <i>turned back...</i>

58:51.424 --> 58:55.292
<i>... to take one last portrait</i>
<i>of the planets of the solar system.</i>

58:55.962 --> 58:58.897
<i>... and one of those pictures</i>
<i>was of the Earth.</i>

58:59.098 --> 59:03.535
<i>A tiny blue dot, set in a sunbeam.</i>

59:04.170 --> 59:05.501
<i>Here it is.</i>

59:05.705 --> 59:08.230
<i>That's where we live. That's home.</i>

59:08.441 --> 59:12.309
<i>We humans are one species,</i>
<i>and this is our world.</i>

59:12.812 --> 59:15.144
It is our responsibility
to cherish it.

59:15.348 --> 59:19.307
Of all the worlds in our solar system,
the only one, so far as we know...

59:19.519 --> 59:21.419
...graced by life.
