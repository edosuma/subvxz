WEBVTT

00:20.958 --> 00:23.958
Oh fuck. Can you believe this shit?

00:23.958 --> 00:27.791
Those rear echelon fuckers screwed up
and only gave me one sock.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.416
Screwed up?

00:29.416 --> 00:31.875
Hey, the big green machine
does not make mistakes, Drew.

00:32.916 --> 00:35.666
Oh yeah? Well, then, what am I
supposed to do with one sock?

00:35.666 --> 00:38.583
Hey, let me borrow that picture
of your sister and I'll show you.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.875
Fuck you.

00:56.458 --> 00:59.250
The USO show.
What can you tell us about it?

00:59.250 --> 01:00.750
It's an honor to play for our boys.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.916
Mm-hmm. Well, what do you think
about the war they're fighting?

01:03.916 --> 01:07.958
Well, I'd just as soon keep
my personal views about that to myself.

01:07.958 --> 01:10.666
I'm just an entertainer,
so I'd rather not say.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.875
Walk with me.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.625
- Why didn't you just answer the question?
- About the war?

01:15.625 --> 01:18.458
Couple reasons.
Most of them being it's nobody's business.

01:18.458 --> 01:21.625
Come on. Look, you're a big deal.
People want to know what you think.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.375
And I've never understood why.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.375
I can help you craft your message.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.791
- How's that sound?
- Like we're talking in circles here.

01:27.791 --> 01:29.416
Just think about it.

01:29.958 --> 01:30.791
Done.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.083
Ah, turns out I still don't want to.

01:33.083 --> 01:34.916
But if anybody
wants to talk about the show--

01:34.916 --> 01:38.541
Ooh, ooh, yeah. Speaking of.
How insanely great are they?

01:39.125 --> 01:40.375
Who? The strippers?

01:40.375 --> 01:42.375
Uh, they're called dancers.

01:42.375 --> 01:45.000
For the show.
I designed the outfits myself.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.958
You really think it's a good idea to put
those ladies in front of a crowd of GIs

01:48.958 --> 01:52.458
who've been living in the jungle,
with each other only, for a year?

01:52.458 --> 01:54.541
It's called showmanship.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.208
No, it's actually called
a rhetorical question.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.916
Hello, hello. Am I interrupting?

01:59.916 --> 02:02.125
What the hell's Robert Goulet doing here?

02:02.125 --> 02:04.166
Oh, he didn't tell you?

02:04.166 --> 02:06.375
Why, I'm part of this USO show.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.250
Some might say the best part.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.750
Haven't the boys over here
been through enough already?

02:10.750 --> 02:15.083
I think a Tony Award-winning Broadway
star is just what the doctor ordered.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.041
That depends on the doctor, I guess.

02:17.041 --> 02:20.833
You know, I've got this kid
who mows my lawn, weapons-grade moron,

02:20.833 --> 02:23.916
been stuck in the sixth grade for years,
big fan of yours.

02:23.916 --> 02:27.291
He had one of your "rock and roll jingles"
playing on the radio the other day.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.666
Catchy, in places.

02:28.666 --> 02:32.500
Happen to remember
which one of my 18 number-one hits it was?

02:32.500 --> 02:36.583
Hard to tell.
Something about dogs or jail or something.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.625
It was all very confusing.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.208
- Thanks.
-  Ah, you're welcome.

02:40.208 --> 02:45.208
No. For reminding me why something
about you always kinda pisses me off.

02:45.208 --> 02:50.250
Well, jealousy manifests itself
in mysterious ways, doesn't it?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.875
Oh, and before I forget,

02:51.875 --> 02:53.458
welcome to TCB.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.791
So glad to have you on board.

02:55.791 --> 02:56.875
Wait, really?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.666
Oh God, no. They just told me to say that.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.625
I don't give a shit.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.625
Fucking Goulet?

03:05.625 --> 03:07.958
What kind of half-assed operation
are you running here?

03:07.958 --> 03:10.208
Oh we're half-assed now?
That's an improvement.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.708
Love the strippers, by the way.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.958
They're not strippers. Fuck.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.750
Right. Sorry. "Med students."

03:24.750 --> 03:26.541
The Ia Drang Valley.

03:26.541 --> 03:31.500
Last week, several GIs were wounded there
in an unusual friendly fire incident.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.000
Highly unusual.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.541
Oh, what did I tell you
about interrupting my briefings?

03:35.541 --> 03:36.500
Uh...

03:36.500 --> 03:37.458
Ah.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.250
Don't. Ever.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.250
What else?

03:40.250 --> 03:43.208
Unless I don't like
my left testicle very much. Sir.

03:43.208 --> 03:45.583
That seems pretty self-explanatory.

03:45.583 --> 03:46.958
Also pretty specific.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.375
Okay, where was I? Right. Friendly fire.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.791
That incident,
along with signal intercepts,

03:51.791 --> 03:55.791
leads us to believe the weapon
you two saw at Altamont may be here now.

03:55.791 --> 03:57.750
What exactly are we dealing with here?

03:57.750 --> 04:00.333
A sonic weapon that turns people

04:00.333 --> 04:02.041
- primal.
- Primal?

04:02.041 --> 04:03.583
Well, if you're susceptible, yes.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.125
But the good news is,
it doesn't work on everybody.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.958
It's 50% effective.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.750
Works on only about half the people,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.166
give or take.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.125
Thus the math.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.500
You seem to know
an awful lot about this thing.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.083
Well, we experimented
with this technology years ago.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.875
Manipulating sound waves
to bypass the conscious mind

04:20.875 --> 04:22.791
and control the subconscious mind.

04:22.791 --> 04:25.000
Wait, are you talking about mind control?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.250
Yeah, great fucking idea.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.625
That's what I said!

04:29.208 --> 04:31.916
Uh, but we had some problems,
had to shut the program down.

04:31.916 --> 04:34.750
And now someone stole your little toy
and turned it into a weapon?

04:34.750 --> 04:37.166
Exactly. And you two
are going to get it back.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.958
You'll take a boat upriver and meet
a TCB contact who will take you in.

04:40.958 --> 04:41.875
Who's the contact?

04:41.875 --> 04:44.500
It's sort of a... surprise.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.041
Doyle, who clearly doesn't like having
a left ball, by the way, is correct.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.500
You'll find out when you get there.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.208
Well, just so long
as I'm back in time for the Jaycees.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.625
 What the hell's a Jaycee?

04:54.625 --> 04:58.250
Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Jaycees.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.791
They're giving me
their Man of the Year award for,

05:00.791 --> 05:03.083
well, you know, obvious reasons.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.666
We'll do our best to get you there.

05:04.666 --> 05:08.208
Good, because not getting there
is not an option, ace.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.083
That is weird.

05:10.083 --> 05:13.125
That sounded a lot like
you telling me what to do.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.708
Glad we're on the same page then.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.958
Let's be clear.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.791
I give the orders around here.

05:18.791 --> 05:20.541
You work for me, King.

05:20.541 --> 05:23.333
Oh, I think you're confusing me
with that guy over there

05:23.333 --> 05:25.166
whose balls you like to talk about.

05:25.791 --> 05:28.125
The ball thing
did fly off the rails a little bit.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.208
Hell yeah!

05:36.875 --> 05:41.541
Jesus! Hey, ever heard of this new thing
called not trying to fucking kill us?

05:41.541 --> 05:42.458
Relax.

05:42.458 --> 05:45.541
Let Bobby Ray have his fun.
He's not gonna get anybody killed.

05:45.541 --> 05:48.708
Oh that's right. We'll already be dead,
thanks to that shit show.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.250
- Uh, better half is calling.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.875
Hey there, honey. What you up to?

05:57.875 --> 05:59.000
Not much.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.291
Just cooking a little dinner for one.

06:01.291 --> 06:04.125
Yeah, sorry.
I know I've been gone a lot lately.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.708
Promise to find time for just you and me.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.500
I'm going to hold you to that.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.416
Please do.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.375
Goddamn it, Scatter!

06:14.375 --> 06:16.416
Put that poor thing out of its misery.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.625
<i>- Just try to have a good time.</i>
- Will do, honey.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.875
Not off to a strong start though.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.083
Heads up.

06:28.958 --> 06:30.208
Thank you for that.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.708
Ah, let's be honest, Doyle.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.750
Given your job
and proximity to yours truly,

06:33.750 --> 06:37.208
the chances of you dying a horrible death
are pretty much through the roof.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.125
But not today, buddy. Not on the agenda.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.666
Okay, um, speaking of my job,

06:41.666 --> 06:44.250
have you perhaps given
any more thought to what I--

06:44.250 --> 06:46.750
- We've been over this, Doyle.
- Indeed, sir. But I--

06:46.750 --> 06:48.583
I know you want to be a field agent,

06:48.583 --> 06:51.666
but I need your clinically obsessive
organizational skills

06:51.666 --> 06:52.750
right where they are.

06:52.750 --> 06:56.458
Thank you, sir,
but being an agent is a dream of mine.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.208
Then keep dreaming. Have fun with that.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.416
Because in real life,

07:00.416 --> 07:04.375
you're not what any rational human being
would call field agent material.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.083
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Sir, if I may--

07:06.083 --> 07:08.750
And not just because you have
the muscle mass of a small child.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.416
It's because you lack awareness, Doyle.

07:11.416 --> 07:13.666
A field agent has to be
ready for anything.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.416
If a flying saucer lands
and a space dragon charges out

07:16.416 --> 07:18.666
to beat you to death
with a fucking strap-on,

07:18.666 --> 07:21.208
you have to be the guy
who saw that coming.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.583
Honestly, sir?
I think I might surprise you.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.208
Hmm.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.000
Then again, you might not.

07:34.208 --> 07:37.000
Any idea who this contact is
we're meeting?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.458
Nope. Just hope to hell
they know what they're doing.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.750
It'll be fine.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.666
Oh, you think so?

07:41.666 --> 07:44.791
Because you see this green shit
all around us? It's a fucking death trap.

07:44.791 --> 07:48.958
Take it easy, CeCe with an E.
It's just the jungle. Been around forever.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.333
Mm, so has typhus,

07:50.333 --> 07:53.708
which I bet, like,
half the mosquitoes here have, by the way.

07:53.708 --> 07:57.458
Hey, you do realize there's
a decent chance that's motor oil, right?

07:58.708 --> 08:01.666
Well, he can have it,
because this baby's purring like a kitten.

08:01.666 --> 08:04.541
Hell, if I'd known the Army
was handing out hot shit like this,

08:04.541 --> 08:06.250
I probably wouldn't have dodged the draft.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.416
Excuse me?

08:07.416 --> 08:09.333
Was that a hell of a cannonball?

08:09.333 --> 08:10.666
You dodged the draft?

08:10.666 --> 08:12.500
Well, now, look here.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.250
I had three cousins who got drafted,
and only two and a half of them came back.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.583
Sorry to hear that.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.166
Look, they didn't really want me anyway
after I checked the box for gonorrhea.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.750
You faked having gonorrhea?

08:22.750 --> 08:26.500
No. I paid hookers to have sex with me
until I got gonorrhea.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.500
Actually took longer than you'd think.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.833
I'm disappointed in you, buddy.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.458
Come on. Can you blame the guy?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.083
This war is a horrible idea.

08:33.083 --> 08:36.791
Since when's trying to spread freedom
around the world a horrible idea?

08:36.791 --> 08:39.541
Uh, since the war stopped
being about that years ago.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.833
Now it's just shitty politicians shipping,

08:41.833 --> 08:44.208
if cannonball guy back there
is any indication,

08:44.208 --> 08:46.666
pretty hot guys
off to a fucking meat grinder.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.875
Well, maybe you should
jump on the next plane home

08:48.875 --> 08:53.041
and get a fucking job
getting high on burning American flags.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.791
No, goddamn it,
that's not a real job.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.166
Tell me what you see.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.666
Well, at first glance,

09:01.666 --> 09:03.833
alarmingly little
in the low-carb department.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.791
Not the menu, you dumbass.
Awareness. Remember?

09:06.791 --> 09:08.500
What do you see around you?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.416
Oh yeah. Right.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.375
Well, we've got
some Army guys drinking at the--

09:13.375 --> 09:16.000
-  Those are Marines.
- Hard to tell the difference.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.875
- Better not say that to them.
- Got it.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.416
Give me that, moron.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.791
Ah. No notes. Makes sense.

09:21.791 --> 09:25.208
Now, one of those Marines
isn't just a Marine.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.166
Right.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.083
Wait, what now?

09:28.083 --> 09:30.041
One of them is our secret contact.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.583
Nice! Which one?

09:31.583 --> 09:33.916
Hey, you're the one
that wants to be an agent.

09:33.916 --> 09:34.958
You tell me.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.041
-  The big one with the mustache?
-  Bingo.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.833
Holy shit, I did it!

09:40.500 --> 09:41.333
Wait.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.500
Why am I breathing so hard
all of a sudden?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.375
- Is that normal?
- Uh, not remotely.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.291
You should probably
see somebody about that.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.083
Well, holy shit.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.125
Looks like the man upstairs finally
changed his mind about old Bobby Ray.

09:56.125 --> 09:59.000
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.541
- What?
- Our TCB contact.

10:01.541 --> 10:02.500
Who, her?

10:02.500 --> 10:05.625
Yeah, her. This is why the Commander
didn't tell us who our contact was.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.083
- There a problem?
- Several.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.208
Starting with the fact that she's my mom.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.333
Wait, seriously?

10:12.333 --> 10:14.291
Yeah, the rest kind of flows from there.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.583
One big river of Freudian shit.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.666
Oh CeCe.

10:20.666 --> 10:21.750
Mom.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.208
You look great.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.791
Huh. Rare dose of positive reinforcement.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.833
The bangs
are an interesting choice, though.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.375
And we're back.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.125
How long's it been? A year?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.166
Try four.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.666
Well, now you're just being ridiculous.

10:35.583 --> 10:40.083
So, are you going to introduce me
to Mr. Tall, Dark, and Insanely Sexy?

10:40.083 --> 10:41.750
Oh God.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.208
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.208
Just throwing up in my mouth a bunch.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.250
Hi, I'm Elvis.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.875
Agent Roxanne Ryder.

10:48.875 --> 10:52.291
Otherwise known as CeCe's mom.
I'll be taking you guys in country.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.708
Well, CeCe's mom,

10:53.708 --> 10:56.958
I would have guessed younger sister,
but I'll take your word for it.

10:56.958 --> 11:00.833
Oh, so piercing blue eyes and charming?

11:00.833 --> 11:03.166
Well, that's a cocktail
I'd chug in the shower.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.208
Can you not, for once?

11:05.208 --> 11:08.833
You know, I actually put my name in
to be your partner, instead of CeCe.

11:08.833 --> 11:09.916
- I'm flattered.
- Mm-hmm.

11:09.916 --> 11:12.916
Yeah. Because that's what moms do
when they're overly competitive

11:12.916 --> 11:15.250
- with the daughter they never wanted.
- Ignore her.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.958
And there's my childhood
in a two-word nutshell.

11:18.958 --> 11:20.458
Now, listen carefully.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.625
I want you to quietly
slip this to our contact.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.791
This is your chance
to show me some tradecraft.

11:27.791 --> 11:29.333
I will not let you down, sir.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.875
Well, first time for everything.

11:30.875 --> 11:31.833
I'm on it.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.833
Something I can help you with?

11:40.291 --> 11:41.250
What the hell?

11:41.916 --> 11:43.500
You having a seizure or something?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.333
Just read the note.

11:47.166 --> 11:52.208
"Dear asshole, is it true <i>'</i> semper fi'
means 'douchebag' in Latin?"

11:52.208 --> 11:53.208
Huh.

11:53.791 --> 11:54.625
Wait, what?

12:14.708 --> 12:17.125
Dynamite work, Doyle.
On your feet, soldier.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.625
So I take it TCB's
sort of the family business?

12:27.625 --> 12:29.416
Oh, we are definitely not a family.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.000
Well, not in the traditional way.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.458
Or any healthy way.

12:32.458 --> 12:37.375
But yes, I joined TCB right out of college
and had CeCe a few years later.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.250
But only after
rampant anonymous sex.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.250
It wasn't anonymous.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.500
Well, it is when you have
no idea who my dad is.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.125
Well, that doesn't mean
he didn't have a name, pookie bear.

12:48.541 --> 12:49.791
"Pookie bear"?

12:49.791 --> 12:52.000
Little nickname I called her
when she was growing up.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.041
No, no. No, you didn't.

12:53.041 --> 12:56.208
You never called me any cute nicknames.
Stop pretending to be normal.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.791
- You were too young to remember.
- Oh, you know what? You're right.

12:58.791 --> 13:02.375
I do remember being called
a "pull-out method cautionary tale."

13:02.375 --> 13:07.791
Hey, I apologized for that
when we had dinner with what's-his-face.

13:07.791 --> 13:09.708
- Craig.
- Who's Craig?

13:09.708 --> 13:12.166
An old boyfriend.
I brought him to dinner one time.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.125
Oh, and I remember
Mom brought her always-fun date,

13:15.125 --> 13:16.708
raging alcoholism.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.875
- Shh. Quiet.
- You quiet.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.166
The broadcast location's
on the other side of that clearing.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.000
Oh great. Thank you. You can go now.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.916
Look, I get it. You don't want me around.

13:26.916 --> 13:29.041
"I was a crappy mom."

13:29.041 --> 13:30.958
You want me to slit my wrists?

13:30.958 --> 13:31.875
No.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.875
But a tiny version of that
might be nice though.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.125
- Everybody stay low.
- Take your time.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.500
Just enjoying the view.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.916
Will you stop it?

13:43.916 --> 13:46.458
What? The man's got
an ass like a French teenager.

13:46.458 --> 13:50.000
Well, I hate to put a crimp
in your plans, ma'am, but I'm married.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.291
Yeah, okay. Trust me,
to her, that doesn't mean... Shit.

13:55.666 --> 13:56.541
Uh...

13:57.125 --> 13:58.958
You may want to hit the deck there,
pookie bear.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.166
- I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.
- Are you kidding me?

14:06.166 --> 14:07.958
- You're doing great.
- Seriously?

14:07.958 --> 14:10.416
God, no! What are you, a fucking moron?

14:10.416 --> 14:11.333
Sorry.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.583
Hey, look at me.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.083
First rule of being a field agent?
Never apologize.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.000
Right.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.833
Second rule... See that guy
in the white suit across the street?

14:21.625 --> 14:23.750
Yeah, him.
I'm going to need you to kill him.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.041
Like, right now.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.541
What? Now?

14:26.541 --> 14:28.500
Well, maybe put some clothes on first.

14:29.416 --> 14:31.208
I wouldn't, but, you know,
most people would.

14:37.416 --> 14:40.541
Please tell me Bobby Ray hears this and
is calling in some fucking air support.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.041
- Mm.
- Mm.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.375
- Mm!

14:44.375 --> 14:47.041
Know what?
I can barely even taste the napalm.

14:55.458 --> 14:59.666
Okay, whoever said it sucks here
may have a point.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.625
Who in the hell are those guys?

15:10.625 --> 15:14.375
Don't know, but they are
definitely not from around here.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.791
You two sit tight. Be right back.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.041
- Cover me.
- On it.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.958
So, whatever happened
to that boyfriend from dinner? Craig?

15:30.958 --> 15:32.875
You had sex with him in the bathroom.

15:53.708 --> 15:57.708
Now that's what we in the business
like to call "done and done."

15:57.708 --> 15:58.916
Which business?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.125
It's a fucking cool line.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.166
Don't overthink it.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.708
Well, this calls for a celebration.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.166
Who's up for a few drinks?

16:06.166 --> 16:08.500
And maybe a few bad decisions.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.875
Jesus, Mom, you're getting
desperation all over his shirt.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.333
- What the--

16:14.333 --> 16:15.666
Cover your ears!

16:30.583 --> 16:32.541
Jesus Christ. You see that?

16:32.541 --> 16:33.791
Turns 'em primal.

16:34.666 --> 16:35.875
We need to go after her.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.666
Eh, do we though?

16:39.125 --> 16:40.583
Oh damn it.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.000
Vietcong tunnel network.

16:44.666 --> 16:45.666
Stay close.

16:55.791 --> 16:57.750
Yup. See? Told you she sucks.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.541
She's been infected by that device.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.708
Yeah, but she still sucks though,
is the takeaway here.

17:06.833 --> 17:09.125
Okay, Captain Nice Guy. I got this.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.291
What...

17:17.958 --> 17:19.416
What the hell happened?

17:23.708 --> 17:25.875
Don't move.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.708
- He's right.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.500
At least not till we're gone. Shall we?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.625
Hang on, what?

17:31.625 --> 17:35.458
Wait, we're not leaving your mother here.
She's standing on a land mine.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.166
Listen to your sexy friend on this.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.916
Oh, you know,
the mission comes first, Mom.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.458
- You taught me that.
- I did?

17:40.458 --> 17:43.208
Of course not! You didn't teach me shit.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.208
Just how to chain-smoke Pall Malls
and make vodka in the toilet.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.166
Jesus.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.625
But you can't leave me here, CeCe.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.208
Yeah? Give me one good reason why.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
Because then you'll never know
who your father is.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.291
- Wait, you know?

17:56.291 --> 17:57.208
Yeah.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.291
Well, why the fuck didn't you tell me?

17:59.291 --> 18:01.375
I don't know, what do you want me to say?

18:01.875 --> 18:03.750
I don't know anything
about being a good mom?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.500
No shit. Look at me.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.958
I try to beat my own daughter
at everything she does

18:07.958 --> 18:09.958
for, like, basically no reason.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.083
Could it be it's because
I'm a walking reminder

18:12.083 --> 18:13.958
of your fading beauty
and inevitable death?

18:15.125 --> 18:17.250
I'm already standing
on a land mine, all right?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.708
So I don't really need a slap in the face
while I'm at it.

18:23.916 --> 18:25.083
Careful.

18:28.916 --> 18:30.041
Thanks for that.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.541
Ew. Don't thank me.
Just tell me who my dad is.

18:32.541 --> 18:35.916
Oh, that. Oh yeah. No, I have no idea.

18:35.916 --> 18:38.333
You fucking lied to me.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.166
Pretty much been lying to you
since you were in diapers. So...

18:42.541 --> 18:44.291
Feels kind of weird to stop now.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.208
Sir, I don't think I can do this.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.625
That man over there
is a spy in the US Embassy.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.791
- And now it's your job to take him out.
- How?

19:02.791 --> 19:04.500
With the fucking weapon I gave you.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.500
Weapon?

19:06.166 --> 19:08.166
This? This is a salad fork.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.666
A really, really shitty one!

19:09.666 --> 19:10.708
Look at me. Look at me.

19:10.708 --> 19:15.000
I want you to think back to all the people
in your life who called you worthless.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.458
- A pathetic loser.
- Not sure this is helping.

19:17.458 --> 19:21.291
A sexless, one-nut nerd
destined for rock-fucking-bottom.

19:21.291 --> 19:24.708
Then you harness that anger,
and you show them how wrong they were.

19:33.791 --> 19:34.875
Safe word.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.416
E!

19:43.416 --> 19:45.000
Jesus, boss. You okay?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.583
Officially been better, buddy.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.125
That's got a certain flair. I like that.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.500

21:45.500 --> 21:48.125
when I'm the one who made sure
you won this stupid little award?

21:48.125 --> 21:50.041
What? What's this?

21:50.041 --> 21:53.333
Oh, I just took the liberty of preparing
a few remarks, little punch-up for you.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.958
Touches on the war here and there.

21:54.958 --> 21:57.083
I told you how I feel about that.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.333
I know you did.
But trust me on this.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.083
Thought we covered this the other day.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.250
Covered what?

22:02.250 --> 22:04.875
That I don't take orders from you.
