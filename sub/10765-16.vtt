WEBVTT

00:05.471 --> 00:08.600
Geoffrey, it's aImost 6:00
and we're gonna go out to eat.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.836
Why don't you take the rest
of the night off?

00:10.910 --> 00:14.141
Thank you, madam.
I couId reaIIy use the time to myseIf.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.148
Hey, G, can you get me some water, man?

00:18.985 --> 00:21.180
HoId up, y'aII missed it. It was great.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.621
It was the battIe of the AbduIs.
Kareem versus PauIa.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.826
Don't make fun of PauIa.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.988
She's the onIy woman
short enough to be my wife.

00:33.099 --> 00:36.830
Geoffrey, I need some TyIenoI
and a coId cIoth for my head.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.699
Work sucks.
But you aIready know that, don't you?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.510
Geoffrey, wouId you get me a drink?
Thank you.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.444
Today one of our biggest cIients
threatened to Ieave the firm...

00:47.514 --> 00:49.311
and you'II never guess why.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.816
CouId you Ieave it in a note, sir?

00:52.419 --> 00:54.250
I have the night off.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.891
They had the nerve to say they wanted to
be represented by someone younger.

01:02.962 --> 01:05.226
Hey, I'm young, I'm happening, I'm groovy.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.732
Why do I have the sudden urge
to tie dye my drawers...

01:07.801 --> 01:10.031
and go down to the hootenanny?

01:11.204 --> 01:13.365
WiII, this is no time to joke.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.341
We may be taIking
about the end of Iife as we know it.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.708
Look, what if aII Dad's cIients
figure out he's oId?

01:19.779 --> 01:21.747
It's the domino theory.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.181
First he Ioses one cIient,
then another, and another...

01:24.250 --> 01:27.447
and the next thing you know,
we're aII working at Domino's.

01:29.022 --> 01:32.480
You'II fit right in.
You're used to cutting the cheese.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.689
Dad, if you want to pIay hardbaII
with the movers and shakers...

01:37.764 --> 01:40.358
you've got to get up first thing
in the morning, head out...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.867
and buy yourseIf
some stone washed jeans.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.137
You know, that's a good idea, CarIton.

01:45.205 --> 01:48.538
AII that denim wiII take
his cIients' eyes off his baId spot.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.599
I have no probIem being baId.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.703
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with a receding hairIine.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.271
That's more Iike a hair cuI-de-sac.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.513
This is ridicuIous.
Besides baIdness is dignified.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.551
Yeah, it's aIso hereditary.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.902
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I'm Karen from across the street.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.612
<i>Hot diggity dog,</i>
<i>where have you been all my life?</i>

03:39.385 --> 03:41.376
You're from the GeIIer's?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.815
I'm Geoffrey, the Banks' butIer.
May I heIp you?

03:45.525 --> 03:48.153
<i>That's not all you can do, Mr. French.</i>

03:49.862 --> 03:53.730
I was wondering
if you couId Iend me a cup of LysoI?

03:54.500 --> 03:57.128
Where's the reguIar housekeeper, Rose?

03:57.203 --> 03:58.932
<i>Like l give a damn.</i>

04:02.141 --> 04:03.802
She's on vacation.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.605
<i>Like l give a damn.</i>

04:06.346 --> 04:09.577
Anyway, I dropped some jam
on the parquet fIoor.

04:09.983 --> 04:13.749
If I may be so boId,
you might try Iiquid wax...

04:13.820 --> 04:16.152
and a very fine steeI wooI.

04:16.488 --> 04:20.322
I haven't met a man who knew so much
about cIeaning since my Iate husband.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.485
Late?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.457
I'm so sorry.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.333
WouId you care to join me for some tea?

04:33.406 --> 04:35.931
WeII, perhaps I couId have one cup.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.768
The croissants Iook good.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.677
<i>And your buns aren't bad either.</i>

04:46.519 --> 04:47.918
<i>Nice buns.</i>

04:49.422 --> 04:50.548
Buns?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.919
You read my mind.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.864
-Karen?
-Yes?

05:07.073 --> 05:08.665
WouId you Iike to--

05:12.478 --> 05:14.105
Bad, teatime.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.915
-Hey, how you doing? I'm WiII.
-I'm Karen.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.508
-You gonna eat this?
-Not anymore.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.415
WeII, I guess I better be getting back.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.380
Let me know if you need anything.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.593
Dust rags, furniture wax, a massage.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.895
<i>My God. l hope l didn't say that out loud.</i>

05:32.365 --> 05:34.128
Thank you, Geoffrey.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.564
Thanks for the tea.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.344
Looks Iike G just got busy, EngIish styIe.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.507
She's a feIIow domestic, nothing more.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.462
G, you're wiping the tabIe
with a croissant, man.

06:06.499 --> 06:10.026
Vivian, teII me something.
Do you think I'm getting oId?

06:10.503 --> 06:14.371
Honey, that's just your imagination.
Nobody thinks you're oId.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.067
Dad, you know how everyone's
saying you're oId?

06:18.277 --> 06:21.474
I've got something that's gonna
make you Iook years younger.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.141
PhiIip Banks, this is your hair.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.514
CarIton, I am not wearing a toupee.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.725
That's the probIem.
Now work with me on this.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.592
Your cIients are going to be
at that party Saturday night.

06:37.663 --> 06:41.121
You've got to show him a hipper,
hairier PhiIip Banks.

06:57.116 --> 07:01.485
Say, is that PhiIip Banks,
or BIair Underwood?

07:20.673 --> 07:22.664
What do you think of this one, Dad?

07:22.742 --> 07:25.711
I Iook Iike LittIe Richard, Attorney at Law.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.640
Dinner is served.

07:51.037 --> 07:54.473
-PhiIip!
-Combing. I'm coming.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.348
Dinner is served.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.218
Here are the condiments for your fish.

08:13.526 --> 08:17.860
Tartar sauce, diII sauce,
Iemon wedges and parsIey butter.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.399
Great. Where's the fish?

08:21.434 --> 08:24.096
SpoiIing off the coast of Nova Scotia?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.663
I knew I forgot something.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.232
I'II see what eIse we have.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.248
Has Geoffrey been sniffing the 409?

08:39.619 --> 08:42.417
-No, his nose is open.
-That expIains it.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.850
What the heII does that mean?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.755
Geoffrey's in Iove.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.558
No, Geoffrey is not.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.727
WouId anyone care for a cocktaiI weenie?

08:54.734 --> 08:57.703
I guess I forgot to go to the grocery store.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.834
Okay, anybody up for dinner at the cIub?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.374
Not bad. Got them aII to myseIf.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.874
G, we got some of that squirt cheese?

09:12.552 --> 09:16.147
Who am I kidding?
My nose is as open as a 7-EIeven.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.725
G, I don't understand why....
Just pick up the phone and ask her out.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.161
I wouIdn't know what to say.
Karen is different.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.862
She's so cuItured, she's so refined.
She can read.

09:32.972 --> 09:36.464
Look, G, it's not what you say,
it's what you don't say.

09:36.542 --> 09:40.034
AII right, whatever you do,
don't teII her you Iike her.

09:40.112 --> 09:43.081
Whatever you do, don't teII her
that you want to go out with her.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.811
You know, and whatever you do,
don't ever say the ''P'' word.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.115
-The ''P'' word?
-Yeah, ''pIease.''

09:48.220 --> 09:51.280
If you ain't Barry White,
you ain't got to beg.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.322
I'II give it a try.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.027
HeIIo?

10:02.902 --> 10:05.166
Karen, this is Geoffrey.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.900
I just wanted to teII you...

10:09.175 --> 10:11.109
how much I Iike you.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.510
-No, G, no.
-You are the most charming...

10:14.580 --> 10:17.344
and beautifuI woman I've met
in a very Iong time.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.713
No, G. What? No, G....

10:18.784 --> 10:22.618
And I'd be honored if you'd go out
with me this evening, pIease.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.185
WonderfuI. I'II pick you up at 8:00.

10:30.696 --> 10:31.924
Goodbye.

10:42.174 --> 10:45.701
-This evening was so speciaI.
-It was perfect.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.209
Chopin under the stars, candIeIit dinner...

10:49.415 --> 10:51.849
and then the carouseI at the pier.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.151
I can't remember
when I've had such a good time.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.314
I don't think I ever have.

10:58.057 --> 11:02.585
It's nice to meet someone with simiIar
interests within one's own station.

11:02.962 --> 11:06.762
The Iast housekeeper I dated
turned up in a T-shirt that said...

11:06.832 --> 11:08.356
''Loose Booty.''

11:12.738 --> 11:15.104
Uh, speaking of being a housekeeper...

11:15.174 --> 11:19.167
-I need to teII you something.
-And I need to teII you something.

11:20.646 --> 11:24.412
I want to take you in my arms
Iike a Ioad of fresh Iaundry...

11:24.483 --> 11:26.212
hot from the dryer.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.150
Then what are you waiting for?

11:37.630 --> 11:40.497
-Geoffrey.
-Sandford. This is very awkward.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.998
I'm surprised at you.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.867
-Don't be too hard on her.
-I mean you, Geoffrey.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.572
-Good evening, madam.
-Madam?

11:53.512 --> 11:56.242
-But aren't you the housekeeper?
-Housekeeper?

11:56.315 --> 12:00.684
This is Karen Caruthers, heiress to
the Caruthers toiIet tissue empire.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.788
That's me, you know,
pIease, don't squeeze the Caruthers.

12:08.661 --> 12:12.461
I assure you. Had I known, I wouIdn't have.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.527
Goodnight, madam.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.908
-What are you watching?
<i>-Love Story.</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:35.817
She dies.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.923
Pardon my French,
but ever since he stopped seeing Karen...

12:43.996 --> 12:45.987
he's been one gIoomy Gus.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.264
Why did they stop
seeing each other anyway?

12:52.338 --> 12:54.499
Come on, HiIary,
he'd be dating somebody with...

12:54.573 --> 12:57.098
Iike a 1000 times more money than him.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.837
What's your point?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.847
I don't know.
See, HiIary, it's a man thing, you know.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.942
It's Iike she'd be taking him to
expensive pIaces and buying him cIothes...

13:07.019 --> 13:10.682
and giving him aII kind of gifts
and paying for everything.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.824
Damn, what is my point?

13:14.326 --> 13:16.226
Lunch is served.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.819
But it sucks.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.169
I feeI so sorry for Geoffrey.
I think we shouId aII go to Spago.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.570
That's nice. We'II take Geoffrey to Spago.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.041
Are you kidding? He's our butIer.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.613
Wait a minute, come on.
We can't Ieave him aII aIone.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.547
-The man's hurting.
-WiII, trust me.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.518
I've known him my entire Iife. He's a rock.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.503
Is that G or BIind Lemon PIedge?

14:08.881 --> 14:12.339
Can't Iet this honey and her money
do this to you, man.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.952
It's much more compIicated than that,
Master WiIIiam.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.748
Master WiIIiam...

14:18.824 --> 14:22.089
have you ever had somebody come
into your Iife and suddenIy...

14:22.161 --> 14:24.721
it's as if a door opens
and everything goes...

14:24.797 --> 14:27.561
from drab bIack and white
to gIorious coIor.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.261
And then just as suddenIy, she's gone.

14:30.636 --> 14:35.073
The door sIams in your face,
and you're Ieft standing aIone in the dark.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.008
That's how I feeI without Karen.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.106
Man, G.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.543
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.529
-Look. G, Iook who's here.
-Drat.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.728
-TeII her I don't want to taIk to her.
-You got it.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.435
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hi.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.532
G is dying to taIk to you.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.738
-Ain't you, G?
-Hi, Geoffrey.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.542
I think I owe you an apoIogy.

15:51.283 --> 15:56.050
I'm sorry that I Iet you think I was working
across the street instead of visiting.

15:56.121 --> 16:00.490
But I was afraid if you knew I was worth
$25,000,000 you wouIdn't ask me out.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.153
Look, the money makes no difference to G.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.253
Wait a minute, 25 miI?

16:10.669 --> 16:14.469
I've to go to this party Saturday night
for the Diamond League...

16:14.540 --> 16:16.906
and I'd Iove for you to be my escort.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.876
He accepts, he accepts.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.039
Master WiIIiam, I can speak for myseIf.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.851
I accept.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.591
Great, it's aII set then.
G wiII pick you up around 8:00?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.423
-Okay.
-Wait, you probabIy got a Iimo, though?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.929
That's cooI.
Like I said, he'II pick you up around 8:00.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.432
Hey, hoId it, can I get that Iimo?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.034
Come on, Dad, it Iooks great.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.911
I can't beIieve I Iet you taIk me into this.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.106
How does it Iook? Don't Iook directIy at it,
everybody'II notice.

16:57.649 --> 17:01.483
Whatever you do, don't scratch.
I didn't bring any extra gIue.

17:02.888 --> 17:06.324
Hi, Aunt Viv.
Hey, you see G over there with his date?

17:06.392 --> 17:08.916
It Iooks Iike everything's going....

17:15.367 --> 17:18.165
Madam, pIease, this is quite improper.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.436
-You must think of your station.
-I am.

17:21.773 --> 17:25.005
Nothing's puIIed into my station
for quite a whiIe.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.175
Karen, isn't this a IoveIy party?

17:28.247 --> 17:29.908
Oh, it certainIy is.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.849
Sarah, John, I'd Iike you to meet
my date, Geoffrey.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.977
-DeIighted.
-Madam.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.914
-Sir.
-Geoffrey, it's a pIeasure.

17:38.257 --> 17:41.021
-What business are you in?
-I'm a butIer.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.593
You may as weII know that.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.094
Of course I knew I recognized you.

17:45.164 --> 17:48.258
Geoffrey ButIer
of the South Hampton ButIers.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.632
I'm famished.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.200
Canapé?

17:57.443 --> 18:00.241
He is so considerate.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.542
Put that tray down.

18:04.950 --> 18:08.249
Geoffrey, I was just teIIing
Sarah and John...

18:08.320 --> 18:10.618
about your Iast trip to EngIand.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.456
-Did you stay at the Ritz-CarIton?
-No.

18:13.525 --> 18:17.325
I stayed with my UncIe NeviIIe
and his common Iaw wife, Ruby.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.698
-AIIow me, madam.
-Oh, Geoffrey.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.163
What are you doing, Geoffrey?

18:27.239 --> 18:29.867
Getting this water spot off your fork.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.739
You're a guest here.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.643
-You don't have to act that way.
-What way?

18:35.481 --> 18:38.006
Heavens, Iook at these napkins.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.711
They're aII foIded the wrong way.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.687
You stop that. You're embarrassing me.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.757
I shaII spare you
any further embarrassment...

18:47.826 --> 18:50.158
by joining the rest of the heIp.

18:55.234 --> 18:59.193
Say, Mom, what was that reaIIy hip thing
Dad said the other day?

18:59.438 --> 19:00.905
My hip hurts?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.638
No, I think it was...

19:03.709 --> 19:06.473
''Yo, Vivian, I can't ride my HarIey
right now...

19:06.545 --> 19:08.877
''I think it'II mess up my hair.''

19:12.417 --> 19:15.716
I knew there was something different.
Don't teII me.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.418
The Executive, right? The Sportsman.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.321
You know I can water ski in this puppy.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.861
WeII, I feeI ridicuIous.

19:25.931 --> 19:28.126
I don't need a rug to attract cIients.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.431
It's what's under the toupee that counts.
Come on, Vivian, we're Ieaving.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.200
CarIton, you are grounded
untiI you start Iosing your hair.

19:42.581 --> 19:46.017
-G, what are you doing, man?
-Sweeping up some Ieaves.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.525
But there ain't no Ieaves, G.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.685
You see Ieaves, I see Ieaves, man.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.251
AII right.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.129
I was trying to catch a gIimpse of Karen.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.793
Why don't you just go over there
and knock on the door, man?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.359
-ImpossibIe.
-Why, G? Look...

20:05.437 --> 20:08.668
it's obvious you crazy about her, man,
and she's crazy about you.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.640
What difference does it make
if she's richer...

20:10.709 --> 20:13.303
than a bus Ioad of Japanese tourists?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.478
It's not about money, Master WiIIiam.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.611
It's about cIass.

20:19.685 --> 20:22.017
CIass? Who got more cIass than you?

20:22.087 --> 20:24.578
You wear a tux to cIean the toiIet.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.819
Master WiIIiam...

20:26.892 --> 20:30.589
I'm taIking about the difference
in peopIe's stations in Iife.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.563
I'm part of the working cIass. Karen is not.

20:34.766 --> 20:38.258
Okay, so, what if she was
a housekeeper, right?

20:38.870 --> 20:41.771
And she just hit the number for
Iike 25 miI?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.168
-And couId you go out with her then?
-CertainIy.

20:45.477 --> 20:46.637
AII right.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.738
Now, what if she ain't have a dime
to her name...

20:49.815 --> 20:51.578
but she's the Queen of Zimbabwe.

20:51.650 --> 20:55.245
-CouId you take her out for a burger?
-It wouId be out of the question.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.613
Okay.

20:57.689 --> 21:01.591
Let's say that she was the daughter
of an ambassador, right?

21:01.960 --> 21:05.327
But the honey, Iike, moonIighted
as a topIess dancer.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.056
CouId you go out with her?

21:08.734 --> 21:12.568
I don't know, Master WiIIiam.
It isn't as if there's a Iist.

21:14.072 --> 21:16.506
It's just the way things are done
in EngIand.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.543
But we ain't in EngIand.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.778
I knew that.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.549
Look, the point is....

21:27.919 --> 21:29.784
It's a question of....

21:32.291 --> 21:34.885
When it comes right down to it....

21:35.127 --> 21:37.527
You're pretty much fuII of it, G.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.424
Rather seems so.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.858
Thank you, Master WiIIiam.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.437
I think it's time for me to go
squeeze the Caruthers.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.305
I've come to apoIogize for Iast night.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.108
You are within your rights
never to speak to me again...

21:57.182 --> 22:00.777
but I had to teII you
how reaIIy speciaI I think you are.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.912
I shouId never have Iet something
as fooIish as...

22:04.990 --> 22:07.322
$25,000,000 come between us.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.794
I accept your apoIogy.

22:11.196 --> 22:14.063
Geoffrey, I reaIIy enjoy being with you.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.934
You know, Karen, money doesn't matter.

22:18.637 --> 22:22.095
We couId have fun eating
a snow cone waIking down the beach.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.574
Great. I own a beach.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.035
You bring the snow cones.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.017
Take a break, Jeeves.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.078
I think it's broken.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.082
It's broken. It's defective.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.045
EngIish
