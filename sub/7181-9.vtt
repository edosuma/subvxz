00:03.738 --> 00:07.006
>> Knocking over that yacht
was a piece of cake.

00:07.008 --> 00:10.576
>> Heh heh heh!
>> Ha ha ha!

00:15.349 --> 00:16.782
>> Aah!

00:49.617 --> 00:52.384
>> Aargh!

01:08.269 --> 01:11.703
>> ¶ It started when
an alien device did what it did

01:11.705 --> 01:15.507
And stuck itself upon his wrist
with secrets that it hid

01:15.509 --> 01:19.411
Now he's got super powers
He's no ordinary kid

01:19.413 --> 01:20.212
He's Ben 10 ¶

01:20.214 --> 01:21.814
>> ¶ Ben 10 ¶
>> ¶ Ben 10 ¶

01:21.816 --> 01:26.118
>> ¶ So if you see him
you might be in for
a big surprise

01:26.120 --> 01:29.655
He'll turn into an alien
before your very eyes

01:29.657 --> 01:31.223
He's funny, freaky,
fast and strong

01:31.225 --> 01:35.127
He's every shape and size
He's Ben 10 ¶

01:35.129 --> 01:36.395
>> ¶ Ben 10 ¶

01:36.397 --> 01:40.232
>> ¶ All new powers
he's on the case

01:40.234 --> 01:43.836
Fighting all evil
from earth or space

01:43.838 --> 01:47.239
He'll never stop till it's OK

01:47.241 --> 01:51.343
'Cause he's the baddest kid
to ever save the day

an old-fashioned fish fry!

02:14.668 --> 02:19.438
Water...
water...

02:34.488 --> 02:37.322
[siren]

02:37.324 --> 02:39.358
>> I don't care
what anybody says.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.460
You circus freaks are OK by me.

02:41.462 --> 02:45.664
>> Circus freak?
I'm not a circus freak.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.834
I'm a superhero.

02:48.836 --> 02:53.572
[splash]
>> Hmm.
Looked like a freak to me.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.242
>> "Zombozo's Traveling
Circus of Laughs"?

02:57.244 --> 03:01.813
Cool!
>> I haven't been to a circus
since I was a boy.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.749
Sounds like fun.
What do you guys think?

03:03.751 --> 03:08.554
>> I love the circus.
>> That's because
you belong in one.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.424
>> Ben.
>> Nah, circus is kid's stuff.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.961
>> Hello?
What are we?
>> [yawn]

03:15.963 --> 03:17.796
Besides, it's pretty late.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.732
>> Ben, it's 11:00
in the morning.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.734
>> Fine by me.
OK, all right.

03:22.736 --> 03:27.472
You guys want to go see
some stupid circus, fine.

03:28.742 --> 03:34.546
>> Ooh.
Looks like the entire town's
turned out for the show.

03:39.753 --> 03:44.356
>> It's probably sold out.
We're probably just
wasting our time.

03:44.358 --> 03:49.494
>> Step right up and see the
fingerless freak of nature,

03:49.496 --> 03:56.668
whose strength knows no bounds!
Thumbskull!

03:58.706 --> 04:01.506
>> [grunts]

04:01.508 --> 04:04.009
[applause]

04:04.912 --> 04:06.478
>> And presenting Frightwig.

04:06.480 --> 04:14.419
When this beauty lets down
her hair, no telling
what could happen.

04:14.421 --> 04:19.391
And last but not least,
the freak whose unique skill

04:19.393 --> 04:25.397
is as vile as his attitude,
Acid Breath!

04:25.766 --> 04:30.469
>> Whoa!
>> Gross!

04:36.043 --> 04:38.677
>> Ha ha ha!
Howdy, folks!

04:38.679 --> 04:41.913
Are you ready to laugh?
Perfect.

04:41.915 --> 04:46.418
You're gonna knock them dead.
Ahh!

04:46.420 --> 04:49.554
Ha ha ha!

04:49.556 --> 04:52.324
>> Hey!
>> Aah! Don't do that.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.560
>> What is your malfunction?
>> What do you mean?

04:55.562 --> 04:57.496
>> Ever since we decided
to go to the circus,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.998
you've been acting
even weirder than normal.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.500
What are you scared of?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.402
>> I'm not scared of anything.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.571
>> Come on, guys,
the show is about to start.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.608
>> After you.

05:09.610 --> 05:15.380
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

05:15.382 --> 05:17.783
the circus of laughter is proud

05:17.785 --> 05:21.620
to present the sultan of smiles,

05:21.622 --> 05:24.423
the crown prince of chuckles,

05:24.425 --> 05:26.725
that rib tickler himself,

05:26.727 --> 05:29.695
the star of our circus,

05:29.697 --> 05:35.567
Zombozo the clown!

05:35.569 --> 05:37.903
[horn honking]

05:41.875 --> 05:45.377
[cheering and applause]

05:45.379 --> 05:47.879
[laughter]

05:58.859 --> 06:01.626
[horn honking]

06:05.399 --> 06:07.899
[laughter]

06:08.068 --> 06:13.071
>> If you love clowns,
then this is the place to be.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.641
You're gonna die laughing.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.011
That's a Zombozo guarantee.

06:20.013 --> 06:24.549
>> I got to go...
get some popcorn.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.152
>> Is Ben all right?
>> You're asking me?

06:27.154 --> 06:30.689
I stopped trying to
figure him out a long time ago.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.024
>> I was never very good
at math,

06:33.026 --> 06:37.863
but I believe I have
your undivided attention.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.632
Now, how about some volunteers?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.901
>> [laughter]
>> Ahh.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.972
So full of life...

06:46.974 --> 06:50.008
for now.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.878
>> [breathing heavily]

06:52.880 --> 06:56.114
There is nothing funny
about clowns.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.151
[glass breaks]

07:03.657 --> 07:05.690
[gasp]

07:08.829 --> 07:12.631
Whoa!
The freaks are felons!

07:41.061 --> 07:45.530
>> It's payday!
Ha ha ha!

07:45.532 --> 07:48.200
>> Time to play fetch.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.902
[beeping]

07:57.778 --> 07:59.077
>> [gasp]

07:59.079 --> 08:01.613
>> [groaning]

08:01.615 --> 08:05.984
>> Good doggy!
Down, boy.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
>> Unh!

08:23.904 --> 08:25.604
>> Hey, that's our stuff!

08:25.606 --> 08:29.140
>> No mutt's gonna
steal my loot.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.843
Get him!

08:40.187 --> 08:42.988
Don't just stand there
like a sore thumb.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.223
Get the boss!

08:45.225 --> 08:48.860
>> [laughter]

08:48.862 --> 08:50.929
>> [chuckling]

08:50.931 --> 08:53.064
Laughter truly is the best

08:53.066 --> 08:57.569
medicine...for me!

09:01.275 --> 09:04.676
>> Uh, excuse me, boss.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.144
Excuse me.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.713
>> How many times
have I told you

09:08.715 --> 09:12.217
not to bother me
while I'm eating?

09:12.219 --> 09:19.024
>> Uh...we ran into
a bit of trouble.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.326
>> Unh!

09:25.933 --> 09:29.634
>> I hear you're full of tricks,
little doggy.

09:29.636 --> 09:35.073
Let's see if you know
how to play dead.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.246
>> [whimpering]

09:41.248 --> 09:47.018
>> This isn't a mad dog.
It's a scaredy-cat!

09:49.256 --> 09:54.793
Bring the curtain down
on this little sideshow.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.739
>> Play's over, Fido.

10:18.685 --> 10:22.821
>> Dog gone!
Ha ha ha!

10:22.823 --> 10:28.994
>> Come on!
We got bigger laughs to get!

10:36.903 --> 10:39.137
>> Whew.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.112
>> [people laughing]

10:51.118 --> 10:54.886
>> Grandpa?
>> Heh heh.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.223
>> Grandpa!
>> Heh.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.260
Oh, Ben. Heh.
Ohh. Where'd you go?

11:02.262 --> 11:05.030
>> Where'd I go?
Where'd the circus go?

11:05.032 --> 11:08.700
>> Huh?
Uh, I'm not so sure.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.670
Uh...

11:11.672 --> 11:14.773
I remember we were laughing.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.174
It was so funny.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.777
Heh.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.979
>> Grandpa, are you OK?

11:20.981 --> 11:26.418
>> Heh. I just...
feel kind of glum, that's all.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.286
Heh heh heh.

11:28.288 --> 11:33.224
>> Then why are you smiling?
Wait a minute.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.027
Where's Gwen?

11:37.330 --> 11:42.934
>> Did you pack me a snack
for the road?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.704
>> [laughter]

11:55.015 --> 11:59.417
>> Zombozo must have zonked out
the entire town during the show

11:59.419 --> 12:02.821
while his freaks
robbed everyone blind.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.889
But why kidnap Gwen?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.958
>> I--I don't know.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.296
But don't worry.
We'll catch that clown.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.430
>> Yeah. Heh!

12:12.432 --> 12:15.400
Who would be afraid of
a silly old clown?

12:15.402 --> 12:18.369
>> Ben, wh-what's bothering you?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.004
>> Promise not to laugh?

12:20.006 --> 12:24.175
I'm afraid of clowns.
They just creep me out.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.376
I'm such a loser.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.247
>> Everybody's got
their own crazy fear, Ben.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.784
When I was a boy,
I was afraid of heights.

12:32.786 --> 12:39.324
Well, enough was enough,
and I climbed to the top
of the water tower.

12:39.326 --> 12:48.199
Sometimes you just got to
scare the fear out...of...you.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.468
Ohh.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.371
>> Grandpa!

13:04.785 --> 13:07.218
Whoa!

13:16.396 --> 13:18.029
Whoa.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.432
I need an anchor, fast!

13:23.270 --> 13:26.905
Come on, come on!

13:30.877 --> 13:33.511
[tires screeching]

13:41.488 --> 13:45.123
Whew.
Grandpa, are you OK?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.592
>> So...sad.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.895
So very, very sad.

13:50.897 --> 13:55.166
>> Grandpa, what happened inside
the big top after I left?

13:55.168 --> 13:58.303
>> [laughter]

14:10.116 --> 14:12.984
>> I love the sound of laughter.

14:12.986 --> 14:17.555
It feeds my soul.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.525
>> Ben, I think that Zombozo

14:20.527 --> 14:23.494
robs people of more
than just their possessions.

14:23.496 --> 14:33.071
I think he steals people's
happiness until there's
nothing left.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.640
>> And he's got Gwen.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.926
>> [gasp]

14:55.896 --> 14:57.962
>> [chuckles]

14:57.964 --> 15:05.937
Looks like we got somebody
who wants to see the show
without buying a ticket.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.574
[beeping]
>> [grunt]

15:09.576 --> 15:14.646
You never make this easy,
do you?

15:14.648 --> 15:18.216
>> Aargh!

15:30.497 --> 15:34.198
What's that noise?

15:36.569 --> 15:42.140
I don't know what you are,
but I'm gonna tear you apart.

15:42.142 --> 15:47.679
>> You want to play hardball?
Game on!

15:50.150 --> 15:52.116
>> Unh!

15:55.655 --> 15:57.422
>> That all you got?

15:57.424 --> 16:01.459
>> Just warming up, lady.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.139
Didn't your mom ever tell you
it's not polite to spit?

16:15.141 --> 16:21.179
>> Who do you think taught me
in the first place?

16:28.221 --> 16:31.222
>> Strike 3!

16:33.326 --> 16:34.592
[panting]

16:34.594 --> 16:37.562
You can do this.
He's just a guy

16:37.564 --> 16:40.331
with a red rubber nose
and big shoes.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.002
Nothing upgrade can't handle.

16:44.004 --> 16:50.274
Whose side are you on, anyway?

16:50.276 --> 16:53.144
Huh?

16:54.214 --> 16:54.712
Oh, great.

16:54.714 --> 17:00.385
Now you're afraid of
your own reflection.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.057
>> Hiya, son!

17:06.059 --> 17:12.497
Something tells me you'd be
a barrel full of laughs.

17:15.335 --> 17:23.508
Hey, Mr. Serious,
how about a smile?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.245
What's your story,
morning glory?

17:27.247 --> 17:32.750
Was that your mutt that
gave my freaks such frowns?

17:32.752 --> 17:35.620
What about that
weird blob outside?

17:35.622 --> 17:41.492
If it weren't for you...
Are you some kind of freak?

17:41.494 --> 17:44.629
>> I'm not a freak.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.366
>> Ha ha ha!

18:00.080 --> 18:04.782
Come on, kid!
You've got to learn
to loosen up.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.686
Laugh a little.

18:08.688 --> 18:13.224
It's what keeps me going.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.794
>> [shouting]

18:25.872 --> 18:28.706
>> [faint moaning]

18:31.644 --> 18:38.182
>> Now, don't tell me
you're afraid of old Zombozo.

18:38.184 --> 18:41.652
>> What do you want?

18:52.665 --> 18:53.598
>> Ha ha ha!

18:53.600 --> 18:58.402
Only what every clown worth
his floppy shoes wants--

18:58.404 --> 18:59.337
to make people laugh!

18:59.339 --> 19:05.376
Then drain their positive energy
like a sponge at a pool party!

19:05.378 --> 19:06.210
Is that so wrong?

19:06.212 --> 19:10.548
>> Is that the machine
you use to suck the happiness
out of your audience?

19:10.550 --> 19:14.318
>> I call it the Cyclown.
Clever, eh?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.521
Soon I'll be taking my act
to the big cities.

19:16.523 --> 19:26.864
Millions of people
laughing for me, feeding me,
making me stronger.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.567
>> I want my cousin back!

19:29.569 --> 19:30.334
>> Cousin?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.703
[gasp]
Didn't you hear?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.873
She ran away with the circus!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.943
>> [chuckling softly]

19:40.847 --> 19:46.651
>> Heh heh heh!
>> Oh, you're funny, but I'm
going to get the last laugh.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.886
[beeping]

20:01.568 --> 20:07.371
>> Nice try, kid, but I sell
the tricks; I don't buy 'em.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.507
>> I just figured out
there's something

20:09.509 --> 20:15.646
I'm even more
afraid of than you.

20:16.716 --> 20:23.955
Losing my family to some
goofball emotional vampire.

20:23.957 --> 20:28.793
In other words...

20:28.795 --> 20:34.632
you're going down, clown.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.914
>> [moaning]

21:01.261 --> 21:03.261
>> I'm warning you to back off.

21:03.263 --> 21:09.000
>> You want to see
something really scary?

21:11.604 --> 21:15.373
>> Unh!
>> Aw.

21:15.375 --> 21:20.778
Now, don't tell me
you're afraid of old Ghostfreak.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.848
>> Please...no more!

21:23.850 --> 21:26.417
>> Boo!

21:28.454 --> 21:28.886
Oh.

21:28.888 --> 21:34.325
That kind of even
freaked me out.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.363
>> What? Ben?

21:39.365 --> 21:43.801
Hey, where's that popcorn?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.870
>> You feeling OK, Grandpa?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.305
>> Happy as a lark.

21:47.307 --> 21:51.075
Pretty clever, you scaring
away your fear like that.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.778
>> Thanks.
>> Boo! Ha ha ha!

21:53.780 --> 21:56.914
>> Oh. Hi, Gwen.
Trying out some new makeup?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.582
That's a good look for you.

21:58.584 --> 22:02.086
>> Aw, you're no fun anymore.
