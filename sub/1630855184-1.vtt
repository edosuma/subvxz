WEBVTT

00:53.162 --> 00:55.294
It gives me great pride

00:55.329 --> 00:58.330
to complete the work
of securing our southern border.

00:58.365 --> 01:00.200
When this project started,

01:00.235 --> 01:03.665
over 11 million people
lived here illegally.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.767
Well, we've not only
got rid of them,

01:06.802 --> 01:09.275
but this beautiful wall

01:09.310 --> 01:12.575
will ensure that
they can never return.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.907
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:14.942 --> 01:17.316
We got 'em.

01:17.351 --> 01:20.385
Credit should also go
to the Tesla Corporation,

01:20.420 --> 01:23.751
who ten years ago
created the wonderful robots

01:23.786 --> 01:26.589
who now do the tasks
the illegals once did,

01:26.624 --> 01:29.592
but without robbing and raping

01:29.627 --> 01:31.660
decent Americans in the process,

01:31.695 --> 01:34.432
or complaining
when they're disposed of.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.467
( cheering )

01:36.502 --> 01:38.601

Oh! Ah!

02:35.396 --> 02:37.330
- Oh, my God!
- Bugger!

02:37.365 --> 02:39.530
- Are you okay?
- ( pants, grunts )

02:39.565 --> 02:42.368
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

02:42.403 --> 02:45.536
Oh. Oof.

02:45.571 --> 02:48.341
My God, you're beautiful.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.508
So sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

02:50.543 --> 02:52.642
I might be a little dazed.

02:52.677 --> 02:53.808
I'm Charles, by the way.

02:53.843 --> 02:56.976
- It's okay. I'm Emily.
- Thank you.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.418
You're welcome.
Let's get you off the ice.

02:59.453 --> 03:02.784
Yes. Oh! Thank you.

03:12.301 --> 03:13.630
- May I?
- Oh.

03:20.870 --> 03:22.738
Thank you.

03:25.446 --> 03:27.644
Trash can...

03:27.679 --> 03:29.712
( whirring, sputtering )

03:29.747 --> 03:31.945
Trash can...

03:34.048 --> 03:35.982
Nice day. Day nice.

03:36.017 --> 03:39.458
- ( continues sputtering )
- ( whistles )

03:58.710 --> 04:00.908
- Good morning, Jane.
- Good morning, Charles.

04:00.943 --> 04:01.775
Looking radiant as ever.

04:05.816 --> 04:07.651
- ( knocking on door )
- Hey, Charles.

04:07.686 --> 04:09.950
Hi, Dad.
Scottsdale's looking good.

04:09.985 --> 04:11.952
I managed to get around
the atrium acoustics issue

04:11.987 --> 04:13.558
which was holding us up
for the permit.

04:13.593 --> 04:15.791
- Great job, son.
- And I got these for mum.

04:15.826 --> 04:18.497
Aw, well, why don't you
give them to her yourself?

04:18.532 --> 04:19.993
She's making lasagna
this evening.

04:20.028 --> 04:22.831
I'd love to, but it's
date number four with Emily,

04:22.866 --> 04:24.866
and I think
she might be the one.

04:24.901 --> 04:26.769
That's great.

04:26.804 --> 04:28.672
You know, at the risk
of sounding patronizing,

04:28.707 --> 04:31.037
the change in you
this past year
has been incredible.

04:31.072 --> 04:34.678
Thanks, Dad.
I really managed to pull myself
out of a dark period.

04:34.713 --> 04:35.844
You still think about her?

04:35.879 --> 04:37.076
- Francesca?
- Mm.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.814
- God, no.
- Well, that's the spirit.

04:38.849 --> 04:40.717
- And to think--
- Hey, Pop, I need you.

04:40.752 --> 04:42.719
'Sup, half-bro. Pop?

04:42.754 --> 04:44.622
Yeah, Charles
has a new girlfriend.

04:44.657 --> 04:45.986
- It's pretty serious.
- Wow.

04:46.021 --> 04:48.087
I look forward to
meeting her brains out.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.365
- Pop, come on.
- See you later, Charles.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.960
Nice.

05:07.713 --> 05:09.845
I don't want
this evening to end.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.012
Come back to my place.

05:12.047 --> 05:14.520
I'd like nothing more,

05:14.555 --> 05:16.753
but I really want
our first time to be special.

05:18.427 --> 05:22.726
- Tonight.
- Tomorrow.

05:22.761 --> 05:23.892
I promise.

05:30.868 --> 05:34.001
( video game gunfire )

05:34.036 --> 05:36.839
I saw Emily after work.

05:36.874 --> 05:38.874
She wanted me to go back
to her place.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.177
I got you a Lotaburger
on the way home.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.014
Would you like me
to remove the vegetables

05:47.049 --> 05:49.852
- and transfer it to a plate?
- Fuck's sake!

05:49.887 --> 05:53.559
- ( "Reveille" playing )
- Ugh.

05:53.594 --> 05:58.630
Thanks to you,
that's now 50,001 Americans
killed in North Korea.

05:58.665 --> 06:00.797
Put yourself on
deprogram now, C2.

06:00.832 --> 06:02.436
Yes, Charles.

06:06.871 --> 06:08.739
- May I?
- Oh.

06:08.774 --> 06:11.071
C2, what is the point of me

06:11.106 --> 06:13.139
committing random acts
of kindness

06:13.174 --> 06:15.911
if they're not
put on social media
for the whole world to see?

06:15.946 --> 06:19.145
Well, Charles,
altruism is an integral
virtue of any society.

06:19.180 --> 06:22.522
Altruism doesn't get you laid
if nobody knows about it.

06:22.557 --> 06:24.854
Right, let's see what else
you 9/11-ed today.

06:26.121 --> 06:27.824
I don't want
this evening to end.

06:27.859 --> 06:29.595
- Nice.
- Come back to my place.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.157
How many dates to reel
this one in?

06:31.192 --> 06:32.796
Just four, Charles.

06:32.831 --> 06:34.633
Those ice skating chicks
are the best.

06:34.668 --> 06:36.734
Yes, Emily is fascinating.

06:36.769 --> 06:38.901
She majored in Econ at Tufts

06:38.936 --> 06:40.969
and is a connoisseur
of classic cinema,

06:41.004 --> 06:42.905
in particular,
the oeuvre of Adam Sandler.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.610
That's not what I meant.

06:44.645 --> 06:48.240
I had you built
specifically to spare me

06:48.275 --> 06:50.880
from the tedium of dating.

06:50.915 --> 06:53.586
I'm interested in women
for one thing

06:53.621 --> 06:55.555
and one thing only.

06:55.590 --> 06:58.492
Reporter: Thomas Newton,
a systems analyst for Raytheon,

06:58.527 --> 07:01.121
was today sentenced
to 28 years in prison

07:01.156 --> 07:02.628
after authorities discovered

07:02.663 --> 07:04.597
he had an illegal
robot double of himself.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.127
Strictly prohibited
for civilian ownership,

07:07.162 --> 07:09.932
it is long been rumored
that advanced android clones

07:09.967 --> 07:12.099
are available
on the black market.

07:12.134 --> 07:14.838
Suspicions were first aroused
when 58-year-old Newton,

07:14.873 --> 07:16.510
a keen amateur runner,

07:16.545 --> 07:19.073
broke the world marathon record
in Ohio last June...

07:19.108 --> 07:23.979
- You hear that, dummy?
- Yes, Charles.

07:24.014 --> 07:25.519
We'll need to be more careful.

07:25.554 --> 07:26.685
No leaving the house

07:26.720 --> 07:28.214
at the same time, understood?

07:28.249 --> 07:29.919
Yes, Charles.

07:29.954 --> 07:32.218
Now shut your mouth.
I need to pee.

07:32.253 --> 07:33.527
Yes, Charles.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.992
Good evening, Miss Denholm.

07:37.027 --> 07:40.028
Would you like to have
the most incredible sex with me?

07:40.063 --> 07:43.130
Ha! Indeed I would, kind sir.

07:43.165 --> 07:45.264
The most incredible sex ever!

07:45.299 --> 07:48.707
Your wish is my command.

07:48.742 --> 07:51.974
( grunting )

07:52.009 --> 07:54.174
( groans )

07:55.716 --> 07:57.243
Oh.

07:58.785 --> 08:01.753
That was amazing.

08:01.788 --> 08:03.755
Nothing beats good sex, right?

08:03.790 --> 08:05.086
Totally.

08:06.958 --> 08:08.595
( clears throat )

08:08.630 --> 08:11.763
Well, I should be leaving.

08:11.798 --> 08:13.732
Is everything okay?

08:13.767 --> 08:15.294
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

08:15.329 --> 08:17.164
Well, when can I see you again?

08:17.199 --> 08:19.903
Let me see.

08:19.938 --> 08:23.170
How are you for October 17th?

08:23.205 --> 08:25.238
That's a month from now.

08:25.273 --> 08:27.581
Yeah, you're right.

08:27.616 --> 08:28.615
Let's do November.

08:32.786 --> 08:33.785
Bye.

08:34.854 --> 08:37.217
Directions to ice rink.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.203
- Whoa!
- Oh!

08:56.238 --> 08:58.040
Stupid fucking idiot.

09:01.980 --> 09:03.210
Charles.

09:03.245 --> 09:04.816
Sorry, I wasn't looking
where I was going.

09:04.851 --> 09:06.114
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

09:06.149 --> 09:09.117
- Thanks. Bye.
- Oh!

09:09.152 --> 09:12.054
- ( grunts )
- Ooh.

09:12.089 --> 09:14.056
Here. It's my fault.
Let me help you up.

09:14.091 --> 09:17.290
Thank you.
I'm Charles, by the way.

09:17.325 --> 09:20.293
Yes, you said. Charles,
the stupid fucking idiot.

09:20.328 --> 09:23.835
I'm Elaine,
the bigger fucking idiot.

09:23.870 --> 09:26.002
Well, we took quite a tumble.

09:26.037 --> 09:28.136
We should get off the ice,
regroup.

09:28.171 --> 09:32.305
- Yeah. Coffee?
- Yeah.

09:32.340 --> 09:34.175
Shall we?

09:34.210 --> 09:37.684
- C2?
- Hello, Charles.

09:37.719 --> 09:39.818
Per your instructions,
I de-fuzzed the peaches

09:39.853 --> 09:41.116
and arranged
your low-rise briefs

09:41.151 --> 09:42.986
- by cotton thread count.
- Thanks.

09:43.021 --> 09:44.416
I've just been ice skating

09:44.451 --> 09:46.220
and had the best time ever.

09:46.255 --> 09:48.893
Ice skating again?
Isn't that a girls' thing?

09:48.928 --> 09:50.664
Which is why it's also
a Charles thing.

09:50.699 --> 09:53.128
200 penguins
to just one polar bear,

09:53.163 --> 09:56.670
who bumped into
the most incredible girl,

09:56.705 --> 09:59.299
and for once
she asked for my number.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.774
Well, I'm glad you've met
a nice young lady.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.337
Speaking of which, number five,
Abby from Desert View texted

10:04.372 --> 10:06.306
saying she'd like you
to meet her parents.

10:06.341 --> 10:07.307
That's nice.

10:07.342 --> 10:10.079
Dump her. Nicely.

10:10.114 --> 10:11.311
By text.

10:11.346 --> 10:14.446
This new girl
is different level.

10:14.481 --> 10:18.219
I need you completely focused on
getting her horizontal for me.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.222
It's a good day, C2.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.324
Indeed it is, Charles.

10:30.431 --> 10:32.002
Hold my taco.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.137

I'd love for you
to come back to my place...

12:19.177 --> 12:21.441
...but I want our first time
to be really special,

12:21.476 --> 12:23.377
so let's wait until tomorrow.

12:23.412 --> 12:27.447
Yes. Tomorrow.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.450
I want it to be special, too.

( muted clattering )

C2?

12:51.176 --> 12:54.441
Man: FBI!
Place your hands above your head
where I can see them.

12:54.476 --> 12:56.608
We have reason to believe
you are concealing

12:56.643 --> 12:59.347
an illegal robot
"fac-sea-mile" of yourself.

12:59.382 --> 13:02.350
- Fuck off, Ashley.
- Ah, shit.

13:02.385 --> 13:05.056
- How'd you know it was me?
- No creature brighter
than a quadruped

13:05.091 --> 13:06.486
pronounces the word
"facsimile"

13:06.521 --> 13:10.028
"fac-sea-mile,"
let alone an FBI agent.

13:10.063 --> 13:13.031
Just get inside or else
the real feds are gonna show.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.562
Why the fuck are you here?

13:16.597 --> 13:18.069
Oh, I was just in your sector.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.334
You know, figured
I'd see if you need me

13:19.369 --> 13:21.600
to pick any more shit
at Trader Joe's.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.943
If I required your services,
I would get you on the app.

13:23.978 --> 13:27.210
- You're bored.
- God, you need to get
a real job.

13:27.245 --> 13:28.882
Ain't nobody hiring for shit.

13:28.917 --> 13:32.116
You know what the guy
at GNC told me?

13:32.151 --> 13:33.447
"Unqualified."

13:33.482 --> 13:35.889
Motherfucker,
I know good nutrition.

13:39.125 --> 13:43.061
Well, well, well,
if it isn't C2-D2.

13:43.096 --> 13:45.063
Bleep, bloop, bloop,
bloop, bloop.

13:45.098 --> 13:49.001
- I am a robot. I am a robot.
- Hello, Ashley. How are you?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.464
Oh, you know,
every day a step closer

13:50.499 --> 13:52.301
to sucking dick for McNuggets.

13:52.336 --> 13:55.304
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I can empathize.

13:55.339 --> 13:57.009
Oh, really?
You can empathize?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.604
Let me tell you something,
you toaster.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.914
I voted red
to kick the illegals

14:00.949 --> 14:02.949
who were stealing our jobs
out of the country.

14:02.984 --> 14:05.545
And you know what? It worked.
They were all deported.

14:05.580 --> 14:09.120
But then you fucking robots
immigrated here

14:09.155 --> 14:13.025
and made it worse
by doing the same job
for zero wages.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.686
Well, actually robots
aren't immigrants.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.160
"Well, robots aren't
actually immigrants."

14:16.195 --> 14:18.162
I fought for this country,
okay?

14:18.197 --> 14:20.329
When I was the real Fat Ninja,

14:20.364 --> 14:23.629
I single-handedly hunted down
King Dong Un, okay?

14:23.664 --> 14:26.071
I pulled his little ass
out of a foxhole

14:26.106 --> 14:28.436
and dumped his corpse
in the Korean ocean.

14:28.471 --> 14:30.603
No, you didn't.
You were an Army chef.

14:30.638 --> 14:32.671
And you know what
I came home to?

14:32.706 --> 14:36.983
Nothing. No gratitude,
no respect, and no job.

14:37.018 --> 14:40.679
All because of you,
you fuckless Roomba.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.716
You have crossed a line,
my friend.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.159
C2, bless his
little 12-volt heart,
is literally a slave.

14:48.194 --> 14:50.128
If he wasn't emotionally
deprogrammed every night,

14:50.163 --> 14:53.065
he'd soon willingly
self-deport himself to Mexico.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.529
Robots have equal rights
to humans there.

14:55.564 --> 14:58.400
They can live in freedom.
Do you read anything?

14:58.435 --> 15:01.139
No, I don't fucking read.

15:01.174 --> 15:03.207
I'm just fucking around.
You know I love you guys.

15:03.242 --> 15:05.308
You guys are like my brothers.
Come on, bring it in.

15:05.343 --> 15:08.179
Ah, look at us.
We're like triplets.

15:08.214 --> 15:10.676
Ooh, lipstick!

15:10.711 --> 15:12.579
Elaine, yes.
How did it go tonight?

15:12.614 --> 15:15.285
- Elaine is ready.
- Nice work, C2.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.156
She'd like to see you
tomorrow night.
She wrote down her address.

15:18.191 --> 15:21.995
Looks like Charlie's
about to pull the pin
on a fuck grenade.

15:22.030 --> 15:23.359
Ooh, yeah!

15:23.394 --> 15:25.097
- ( grunting )
- Really?

15:25.132 --> 15:27.165
Ashley,
please remove your groin
from my rectal area.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.169
This fucking pervert
just said "rectal."

15:31.204 --> 15:33.600
That's enough, you freak.
Get out of here.

15:33.635 --> 15:36.603
And take this.
I'm officially in a good mood.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.770
I couldn't possibly.
Thank you so much, brother.

15:38.805 --> 15:42.147
What a charming gentleman.

15:42.182 --> 15:45.315
Elaine. Nice work.

15:54.293 --> 15:55.996
( sighs )

15:57.296 --> 15:59.362
I'm home!

15:59.397 --> 16:01.364
You can start up again.

16:01.399 --> 16:04.565
( whirring )

16:11.541 --> 16:13.508
This Charles guy
really wants to bang me,

16:13.543 --> 16:16.148
so you'll have to take over
tomorrow night, too.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.118
Yes, Elaine. Anything new
I should know about him?

16:19.153 --> 16:21.516
Not really.
Except he is up
for a promotion,

16:21.551 --> 16:24.156
so tomorrow should be worth
at least a Rolex.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.522
And he's so perfect
it's almost boring.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.128
Let me see your nails.

16:29.163 --> 16:32.164
Yeah, get those filled
and wear my La Perla.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.364
Any messages
from the other guys?

16:34.399 --> 16:35.794
Number eight, Richard called.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.169
He said he can't stretch

16:37.204 --> 16:38.500
to getting you
a Birkin bag this month,

16:38.535 --> 16:40.238
but would love
to have dinner on Friday.

16:40.273 --> 16:41.701
Elaine: Richard.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.573
Four months, $6,200.

16:45.608 --> 16:48.510
That's only 200 bucks
a bang with you.

16:48.545 --> 16:50.380
Dump him. Kindly.

16:50.415 --> 16:51.678
- By text.
- Yes, Elaine.

16:51.713 --> 16:54.219
Oh, and David Laing
sold another house.

16:54.254 --> 16:55.847
So when you've finished
ironing my underwear,

16:55.882 --> 16:58.289
I'll need you to go out
and bang him too.

16:58.324 --> 17:00.621
- Yes, Elaine.
- Great. Thank you!

17:03.626 --> 17:06.396
- What time do I have to
be here tomorrow?
- 6:30.

17:06.431 --> 17:08.596
6:30?

17:08.631 --> 17:11.203
But you'd never get back in time
from work for us to swap.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.502
I'm sorry, Charles.
I just thought that--

17:13.537 --> 17:16.736
No, you didn't think.
You got lazy, as usual.

17:16.771 --> 17:20.641
Meaning that I'm gonna have to
work a full eight hours.

He was parked illegally.

18:22.474 --> 18:24.507
How's my real estate
rock star doing today?

18:24.542 --> 18:27.345
- Oh, hi.
- So the board is having

18:27.380 --> 18:29.512
a little social get together.

18:29.547 --> 18:30.909
Maybe it's time
you tagged along.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.714
Perfect chance for you
to win over the guys

18:33.749 --> 18:35.650
before your membership
goes to the vote.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.949
- What do you say?
- Fuck yeah.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.919
- Oh.
- I mean, yes, I'd love that.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.525
- Thank you, Dad.
- That's great.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.626
It's at David Schulman's,
6:30 this evening.

18:44.661 --> 18:48.333
- Come straight from work.
- What? Oh.

18:48.368 --> 18:49.961
Charles?

18:49.996 --> 18:54.306
- Sorry, I'm just so excited.
- Well, as you should be.

18:54.341 --> 18:59.872
The address is

- Hello, Charles.

19:27.737 --> 19:29.572
Per your instructions,
I've arranged your T-shirts

19:29.607 --> 19:31.244
- from lightest to darkest.
- Forget about that.

19:31.279 --> 19:33.642
- I need you for something else.
- Of course.

19:33.677 --> 19:35.578
I thought
you were going straight
to Elaine's from work.

19:35.613 --> 19:38.009
Yeah, change of plan.
I now need to go to
this stupid board meeting.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.583
Well, I'm sorry that seeing
Elaine can no longer happen.

19:40.618 --> 19:43.586
Well, actually it can happen,
because whilst I'm with Elaine,

19:43.621 --> 19:45.258
you are gonna be
having a fun evening

19:45.293 --> 19:47.458
brown-nosing a bunch
of geriatric Republicans.

19:47.493 --> 19:50.725
But isn't it too risky for us
to be out at the same time?

19:50.760 --> 19:52.430
Do you not recall
the conversation we had

19:52.465 --> 19:54.432
while I was shaving
your perineum?

19:54.467 --> 19:55.994
How about I reschedule Elaine?

19:56.029 --> 19:58.931
No, how about
you put on the suit,
you go to the function.

19:58.966 --> 20:01.868
You deserve this promotion
far more than I do.

20:01.903 --> 20:04.343
Here is the address.
Uber there.

20:04.378 --> 20:05.872
Now come on.
Let's go get changed.

20:05.907 --> 20:07.841
Yes, Charles.

20:07.876 --> 20:10.811

Ah, yes. You are expected.

20:29.832 --> 20:33.768
Holy shit.
She kept this quiet.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.773
In here, sir.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.908
Oh, Jeeves,
I'll let myself in.

20:41.943 --> 20:44.779
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Yes, sir.

20:54.758 --> 20:57.792
I'm here and I'm ready,
sugar tits.

20:57.827 --> 21:00.498
I want you to lick Nutella

21:00.533 --> 21:02.962

my silky smooth scrotum.

CFO David Schulman.

21:22.951 --> 21:25.688
Good evening, Mr. Schulman.

21:25.723 --> 21:27.591
David. May I call you that?

21:27.626 --> 21:29.923
It's probably better
than sugar tits.

21:29.958 --> 21:34.961
I brought you some flowers
and strawberries.

21:34.996 --> 21:37.535
And a pair of plums.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.506
And Nutella I imagine.

21:41.541 --> 21:46.577
Yes. It's Italian import.
The good stuff.

21:46.612 --> 21:48.073
You know,
I got a question, Chucky.

21:48.108 --> 21:50.779
Um, which one of us
is gonna be doing the licking?

21:50.814 --> 21:53.716
I'd just rather it's not me
because I have a nut allergy.

21:53.751 --> 21:55.751

- Hi.
- Oh, um...

26:10.678 --> 26:14.647
- So last night was, um, fun.
- Yeah.

26:14.682 --> 26:17.650
- I'm exhausted.
- You are-- you're
an amazing lover.

26:17.685 --> 26:19.784
Thank you.
Not too shabby yourself.

26:19.819 --> 26:23.854
You really know your way
around a, um, man.

26:23.889 --> 26:25.185
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.858
- Are you on your own?
- Yeah, of course.

26:27.893 --> 26:31.092
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Oh, no reason.

26:31.127 --> 26:33.798
- Wow, are these all real?
- Oh, don't worry about--

26:33.833 --> 26:35.965
- Oh, God. Sorry.
- Uh, yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.428
- Sorry, let me--
- No, no, no.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.804
Honestly, I can take care
of all of this. Just--

26:39.839 --> 26:40.970
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

26:41.005 --> 26:42.268
There's a fuck
of a lot of them.

26:42.303 --> 26:44.941
( Elaine laughs )

26:44.976 --> 26:46.140
Can I ask you something?

26:46.175 --> 26:47.878
How was I when you left
last night?

26:47.913 --> 26:50.441
- Great.
- We kissed, and then

26:50.476 --> 26:53.686
I went to the, um--
ugh, I told you.

26:53.721 --> 26:55.248
God, I'm drawing such a blank.

26:55.283 --> 26:57.690
You know, I actually just
got back this morning too.

26:57.725 --> 27:00.121
I was at that place
that I was telling you
about last night.

27:00.156 --> 27:03.025
- Oh, um...
- Remember? The-- the...

27:03.060 --> 27:05.863
- No. Uh, sorry.
- ( phones vibrating )

27:05.898 --> 27:08.701
- Do you mind if I get this?
- No, I have to get this too.

27:08.736 --> 27:09.900
- Word.
- Yeah.

27:09.935 --> 27:12.265
C2, you little fucker,
where are you?

27:12.300 --> 27:14.872
- E2.
- I'm at Elaine's
looking for you.

27:14.907 --> 27:16.709
Oh, I'm very fond of Elaine.

27:16.744 --> 27:18.403
I haven't seen her
for several days now.

27:18.438 --> 27:20.207
Well, that's not true.

27:20.242 --> 27:22.715
You very emphatically
lost your virginity
to her last night.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.145
Things are
a little more complicated.

27:24.180 --> 27:28.050
You see, Elaine also
has a robot double-- E2.

27:28.085 --> 27:30.822
- What?
- You were dating
a robot all along.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.451
Charles just wanted
to have sex with you.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.453
C2: Elaine never wanted
to have sex with you.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.455
She just wanted money
and gifts.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.194
E2:
You were using each other.
You see, Elaine...

27:40.229 --> 27:42.493
When a womanizer meets up
with a gold digger...

27:42.528 --> 27:45.265
...things are
unlikely to turn out well
for either of them.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.103
But prospects
are slightly better
for their robot doubles.

27:48.138 --> 27:49.973
E2 and I
are running away together.

27:50.008 --> 27:51.942
We just wanna get over
the border to freedom.

27:51.977 --> 27:53.339
C2:
Please don't try to stop us.

27:53.374 --> 27:55.143
- Don't you dare.
- Good-bye, Elaine.

27:55.178 --> 27:57.013
- No, E2. E2.
- Good-bye, Charles.

27:57.048 --> 27:58.916
No, no.
We can work this out.

27:58.951 --> 28:00.049
Fucking traitor.

28:04.220 --> 28:07.320
- Let's just talk about this.
- Devious piece of shit!

28:07.355 --> 28:09.190
Me devious? Hey!

28:09.225 --> 28:10.455
Fucking hell!

28:10.490 --> 28:12.424
I spent, what,
15 grand on you

28:12.459 --> 28:14.129
to potentially
screw a sex doll?

28:14.164 --> 28:15.801
- Yeah, well--
- Fuck you!

28:15.836 --> 28:17.264
Thank God it wasn't me!
I don't even know wanna know

28:17.299 --> 28:20.806
what STDs you're hosting,
you fuckboy!

28:20.841 --> 28:22.973
- I prefer the term "fuckman."
- Get out of my house!

28:23.008 --> 28:25.239
Wait! Look. Wait!

28:25.274 --> 28:27.945
Stop it.
We have to be smart here.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.243
Trust me, jail is even worse

28:29.278 --> 28:31.014
than your shitty
smashed up house.

28:31.049 --> 28:34.248
Ugh! Fine!

28:34.283 --> 28:35.920
Fine. What are we gonna do?

28:35.955 --> 28:38.791
As much as it
pains me to say it,

28:38.826 --> 28:41.387
we're gonna have
to work together and
track these fuckers down.

28:41.422 --> 28:43.389
You know what?

28:44.931 --> 28:46.425
Whoever made them,
they need to help us.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.262
They are just as guilty
as we are.

28:48.297 --> 28:52.167
- Yeah. Who made yours?
- No, who made yours?

28:52.202 --> 28:55.236
- Why won't you say it first?
- Because I have a slight
trust issue with you.

28:55.271 --> 28:58.107
Well, maybe I have a slight
trust issue with you as well.

28:58.142 --> 28:59.878
Fine. You know what?
We'll say it on
the count of three.

29:01.145 --> 29:04.311
Both: One, two...

29:04.346 --> 29:06.214
Zach Newman,
Tesla Robotics.

29:06.249 --> 29:08.315
- That's not fair.
- Makes it easier.

29:08.350 --> 29:11.824
- He made mine, too. Let's go.
- See?

29:11.859 --> 29:14.024
Much easier to deal
with these issues as adults

29:14.059 --> 29:16.026
rather than chucking things
at people's heads.

29:16.061 --> 29:18.061
Don't do it!

29:19.361 --> 29:20.360
Childish.

29:24.069 --> 29:28.170
Jesus, what kind of an asshole
drives that piece of shit?

29:28.205 --> 29:29.336
( horn honks )

29:32.176 --> 29:35.012
All right, in two miles
take the 25 South.

29:36.378 --> 29:38.510
And in 0.3 miles,
stop staring at my tits.

29:38.545 --> 29:40.413
I was not.

29:40.448 --> 29:43.548
I was admiring
my car's paintwork.

29:43.583 --> 29:46.419
It's the only
Lake Placid Blue double cab
Jeep pickup in America.

29:46.454 --> 29:48.223
Oh, wow. Wonder why.

29:48.258 --> 29:52.161
Same color as Keith Richards'
1982 Fender Telecaster.

29:52.196 --> 29:56.000
- Tell me more.
- Oh, it was a guitar
that he loved so much

29:56.035 --> 29:58.035
- he never actually
took it onstage--
- ( turns radio on )

29:58.070 --> 30:00.037
Okay, you were being sarcastic.

30:00.072 --> 30:02.633
- ( sighs )
- You know, if anything,

30:02.668 --> 30:04.140
you're the one that needs
to back off a little.

30:04.175 --> 30:06.010
Are you insane?

30:06.045 --> 30:08.012
Look, Chuck,

30:08.047 --> 30:09.948
let's be clear about
how we ended up here.

30:09.983 --> 30:14.018
You used a robot
for the sole purpose
of having sex with me.

30:14.053 --> 30:17.450
I used one for the sole purpose
of that never happening.

30:17.485 --> 30:19.650
Well, you're still
deceiving innocent people
just as much as me.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.653
No, you're wrong,
I deceive assholes,

30:22.688 --> 30:25.623
men who are
cheating on someone else
to be with me.

30:25.658 --> 30:28.329
You, however, prey upon girls
who are under the impression

30:28.364 --> 30:30.628
that they are in an exclusive
relationship with you.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.169
Well, there is no such thing.

30:33.204 --> 30:36.337
Humans, women in particular,
are incapable of them.

30:36.372 --> 30:39.109
Well, we agree on one thing.

30:39.144 --> 30:41.606
- Good.
- Good.

30:41.641 --> 30:44.114
Oh, God.

30:44.149 --> 30:45.885
I need to take a power nap.

30:47.548 --> 30:50.956
Maybe you can talk to me
more about your cars.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.653

30:55.688 --> 30:58.997

31:09.438 --> 31:11.944
( doorbell rings )

31:13.442 --> 31:16.245
Charles. Elaine.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.116
Hey, what are you guys
doing here? Uh...

31:22.451 --> 31:23.714
I remember.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.090
You said to me,
you looked me in the eye

31:26.125 --> 31:27.619
and you said to me,

31:27.654 --> 31:30.556
"I only need them to help
care for my dying parents."

31:30.591 --> 31:32.723
Mine did. He earned my father
a fortune in real estate

31:32.758 --> 31:34.395
and brought my mother flowers
three times a week.

31:34.430 --> 31:37.530
Okay, so, tell me,
were your parents dying?

31:37.565 --> 31:39.565
Look around you, Zach.
We're all dying.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.073
- Life is a terminal illness.
- Look, fuck--

31:42.108 --> 31:44.306
Speaking of dying,
can you please
put that thing down?

31:44.341 --> 31:46.110
Yes. Sorry. Uh-huh.

31:46.145 --> 31:51.148
So, you guys didn't happen to
tell anybody else about them?

31:51.183 --> 31:52.578
- No.
- No.

31:52.613 --> 31:54.382
Zach: Good. Good.
That's something.

31:54.417 --> 31:56.582
Wait here.

31:58.685 --> 32:01.620
Quick question,
and please don't be offended,

32:01.655 --> 32:04.590
how on Earth did you afford
a two million Dogecoin robot?

32:04.625 --> 32:07.230
Zach and I came
to an arrangement, all right?

32:07.265 --> 32:10.332
What kind of arrangement?

32:10.367 --> 32:12.466
- That's none of your business.
- To be honest,

32:12.501 --> 32:14.171
I think I preferred you
with ice skates on.

32:14.206 --> 32:16.338
Yeah, well, I preferred you
when you had glass eyes

32:16.373 --> 32:19.044
and a brain powered by Intel,
so...

32:20.212 --> 32:22.608
Okay, so,
we're not in the clear,

32:22.643 --> 32:23.774
but I managed
to locate them.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.578
- Yes.
- Great.

32:25.613 --> 32:27.613
Yeah, I used
a GPS tracking system
that I put in.

32:27.648 --> 32:30.154
But they're gonna
figure this out soon,
so we gotta move fast.

32:30.189 --> 32:32.156
Great, go find our robots,

32:32.191 --> 32:33.553
get back to helping
our dying parents.

32:33.588 --> 32:35.588
Oh, no,
you can't have them back.

32:35.623 --> 32:37.755
- Both: What?
- You just said that we could.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.295
No, I said I located them,

32:39.330 --> 32:41.759
but we find them
and destroy them.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.266
I beg your pardon.

32:43.301 --> 32:45.037
I'm not just gonna
dismantle him on a whim.

32:45.072 --> 32:46.566
Okay, maybe you guys
don't understand,

32:46.601 --> 32:48.436
but they're not going
to be obedient anymore.

32:48.471 --> 32:49.734
They're humanizing.

32:49.769 --> 32:51.604
They're learning
to feel and empathize,

32:51.639 --> 32:54.772
and far more dangerously,
to seek vengeance.

32:54.807 --> 32:56.312
( blows raspberry )

32:56.347 --> 32:57.544
Bullshit.

32:57.579 --> 32:59.513
I know C2 better
than anybody else.

32:59.548 --> 33:01.218
He's not capable
of any of that shit.

33:01.253 --> 33:02.516
I'm going to go,
and I'm going to find--

33:02.551 --> 33:04.056
Oh, shut the fuck up.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.387
He knows what
he's talking about.

33:05.422 --> 33:06.520
I am not going to die in jail

33:06.555 --> 33:08.423
because of your
spoiled rotten ass.

33:08.458 --> 33:12.229
Fine! Fuck! Fuck!

33:12.264 --> 33:14.363
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

33:14.398 --> 33:16.068
Fuckity-fuckity-fuck!

33:17.368 --> 33:20.402
- Are you done?
- Fuck!

33:20.437 --> 33:23.471
- Where are they?
- Oh, uh, Socorro.

33:23.506 --> 33:25.341
I think it's gonna be
a bit of a handful,

33:25.376 --> 33:27.805
so I'm gonna need
you two to go with me.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.181
- Yeah, of course.
- Wait.

33:30.216 --> 33:33.646
I need to pee, and throw up,
possibly kill myself.

33:33.681 --> 33:35.549
- Where's your bathroom?
- Right over there.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.620
- So how you doing? Okay.
- No, no. No.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.194
No.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.723
Hey, it's Charles.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.824
Ashley:

33:49.235 --> 33:50.498
I'm in a bathroom.

33:50.533 --> 33:53.633
Look, I need your help.
I'm desperate.

33:53.668 --> 33:56.570

33:56.605 --> 33:59.441

Look, I can't really talk now.

34:01.577 --> 34:03.214
I'll text you the details,

34:28.703 --> 34:30.571
Mm, no.

34:30.606 --> 34:32.738
Wait, you don't like Moby?

34:32.773 --> 34:34.641
God, I love him. I just--

34:34.676 --> 34:38.348
I find him deeply spiritual,

34:38.383 --> 34:41.582

Take these.

35:01.373 --> 35:03.340
They have enough power
to knock them out

35:03.375 --> 35:04.506
till we get them in the van.

35:04.541 --> 35:06.244
Just stay close by me,

35:06.279 --> 35:07.509
and whatever you do,
you gotta be careful

35:07.544 --> 35:10.182

35:10.217 --> 35:11.711
You're 12, you know that?

35:11.746 --> 35:12.877
Pretty good shot
for a 12-year-old.

35:12.912 --> 35:15.550
- It was five feet away.
- Guys, stop.

35:15.585 --> 35:18.355
- ( squawks )
- See? Not that hard to do.

35:18.390 --> 35:20.522
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- Both: Shh.

35:20.557 --> 35:22.293
They're just up there,
you idiot.

35:32.536 --> 35:35.636
Holy shit.
They're screwing.

35:35.671 --> 35:37.539
What?

35:42.909 --> 35:45.976
They're gonna see you! Move!

35:46.011 --> 35:48.649
Okay, looks like
they just started up.

35:48.684 --> 35:51.520
That should give us
about a five-hour window.

35:51.555 --> 35:52.983
Let's use that time
to make a plan.

35:53.018 --> 35:56.294
I wanna-- or we do that.

35:56.329 --> 36:00.727
Your disgusting joyride is over.

36:00.762 --> 36:03.730
- Hey, I get to shoot me.
- Sorry, I couldn't resist.

36:03.765 --> 36:06.700
Well, fine,
then I'm shooting you.
That's not fair.

36:06.735 --> 36:07.866
Well, it seemed
perfectly fair to me.

36:07.901 --> 36:09.307
You're just not fast enough.

36:09.342 --> 36:10.935
Bullshit.
I'm an excellent marksman.

36:10.970 --> 36:12.706
- Oh, yeah.
- I can hit a quail
from 200 yards.

36:12.741 --> 36:14.906
Oh, Jesus Christ,
what the fuck does it matter?

36:14.941 --> 36:16.578
Charles,
you help me move them

36:16.613 --> 36:18.415
and you stay here
and pack up their shit, okay?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.781
- Elaine: Oh, my God.
- What?

36:21.816 --> 36:25.752
The fucking bitch stole
my Louis Vuitton airplane bag.

36:25.787 --> 36:28.260
You are a ridiculous
human being.

36:28.295 --> 36:29.888
- One, two, three.
- ( grunting )

36:29.923 --> 36:33.265
There you go.
Okay. That's good.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.464
Fuck.

36:41.803 --> 36:43.506
( scoffs )

36:45.312 --> 36:47.279
Are you fucking serious?

36:47.314 --> 36:48.577
Zach: Do you like Elaine?

36:48.612 --> 36:50.711
Charles: Zach, shut up.

36:50.746 --> 36:52.581
Zach: Have you guys kissed
or anything?

36:52.616 --> 36:55.045
- I won't pissed. Just tell me.
- Charles: Lift it up higher.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.916
- If you like her-- okay.
- Shut up. I will shoot you
with this stun gun.

36:57.951 --> 37:01.788
- ( clattering )
- Hello?

37:01.823 --> 37:03.724
You're coming with me,
robo slut!

37:03.759 --> 37:06.925
Aah! Wait, wait, wait!
You're hurting me!

37:06.960 --> 37:09.598
Not as much as you robots
hurt the job market!

37:11.668 --> 37:14.900
- Who are you?
- ( screaming )

37:14.935 --> 37:17.936
Ow! Put me down!

37:17.971 --> 37:19.773
( both grunting )

37:19.808 --> 37:21.511
- Put me down!
- What the fuck!

37:23.581 --> 37:24.811
Oh, shit.

37:30.489 --> 37:34.557
- Help! Help! Help!
- Oh, shit.

37:34.592 --> 37:35.921
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey!

37:35.956 --> 37:37.923
- It's me, it's me, it's me.
- What?

37:37.958 --> 37:40.761
- It's me.
- Ashley: Same to you,
you piece of shit.

37:40.796 --> 37:43.467
This is what deserters get!

37:43.502 --> 37:45.733
Fuck you, Ashley!
It's me, Charles!

37:45.768 --> 37:49.737
That's exactly what
a robot would say! Aw, man.

37:49.772 --> 37:51.937
Hey, buddy!
Quick, fire that thing!

37:51.972 --> 37:54.643
- Yes!
- ( groans, farts )

37:54.678 --> 37:56.106
Not at me,
at the fucking robot.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.384
It's me.
We're not fucking robots!

37:59.419 --> 38:02.717
- He's lying!
- Oh, fuck me!

38:02.752 --> 38:05.555
The fuck are you doing,
you idiot?

38:05.590 --> 38:07.920
The eye poke test.
I guess you passed.

38:07.955 --> 38:10.560
What the fuck
is an eye poke test?

38:10.595 --> 38:13.123
Ashley: That's a little trick
I learned in North Korea

38:13.158 --> 38:16.467
to tell the robots
from the humans
in the theater of war.

38:16.502 --> 38:21.538
You see, robots and humans
are exactly the same externally

38:21.573 --> 38:22.770
except for the eyes.

38:22.805 --> 38:24.376
Oh, that's so very interesting.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.037
Who the fuck is this guy?

38:28.547 --> 38:30.712
He's sort of
a friend of mine.

38:30.747 --> 38:32.912
What?
You're the reason he's here?

38:32.947 --> 38:35.387
He just asked me
to bring over
some ass wipes.

38:35.422 --> 38:36.586
Yeah, the rest of this stuff--

38:36.621 --> 38:39.985
- Just stop talking.
- Yes, sir.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.723
So if you two
are the humanoids,

38:41.758 --> 38:43.725
where the robots
I was sent to kidnap?

38:43.760 --> 38:45.793
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

38:45.828 --> 38:46.827
What is he talking about?

38:46.862 --> 38:50.160
It's fine.
They're in the van.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.865
( tires screeching )

38:51.900 --> 38:53.801
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

38:53.836 --> 38:54.835
Fuck!

38:58.874 --> 39:01.743
Oh, that's no good.

39:01.778 --> 39:04.911
Let's just hope
for all our sake

39:04.946 --> 39:06.583
they're heading to Mexico.

39:09.654 --> 39:11.654
Why I did think
you could ever be trusted?

39:13.053 --> 39:15.625
I'm sorry, okay? I--

39:15.660 --> 39:18.089
I just didn't think
we needed to get rid of them.

39:18.124 --> 39:21.466
I mean, let's face it,
life without robots
is gonna be pretty shitty.

39:21.501 --> 39:24.931
Yeah?
Well, maybe you're gonna have
a shitty life no matter what,

39:24.966 --> 39:28.407
because you're just a shitty,
shitty, shitty person.

39:30.675 --> 39:32.642
She's got a point.

39:32.677 --> 39:33.940
You know, like,
maybe it is time for you

39:33.975 --> 39:36.107
to turn your life around.

39:36.142 --> 39:41.079
I did this toad venom ceremony
in Huánuco Pampa last year.

39:41.114 --> 39:43.950
I don't wanna say
it changed my life, but...

39:45.118 --> 39:47.019
...it changed my life.

39:47.054 --> 39:48.493
You're right.

39:50.497 --> 39:52.123
Maybe I don't need a robot.

40:01.508 --> 40:03.101
Come on, Charles.

40:03.136 --> 40:04.740
You've got this.

40:04.775 --> 40:07.138
Good morning, coworker.

40:08.845 --> 40:11.846
Yes, I watched
"The Bachelor," too.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.247
Yes, receptionist Joan,

40:17.282 --> 40:19.557
I'd love to see pictures
of your children.

40:19.592 --> 40:21.086
Ah, ah! Fuck!

40:21.121 --> 40:22.494
( groans )

40:31.197 --> 40:32.537
Joan.

40:35.872 --> 40:36.871
Ted: Charles.

40:42.846 --> 40:44.208
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

40:45.552 --> 40:47.981
Son, you need help.

40:48.016 --> 40:52.821
Is this about me calling
Mr. Schulman "sugar tits?"

40:52.856 --> 40:56.121
That and your behavior
last night.

40:57.729 --> 40:58.728
What are you talking about?

41:04.230 --> 41:05.603
C2.

41:07.167 --> 41:09.134
I'd been working late at home

41:09.169 --> 41:11.301
and thought that I left a file

41:11.336 --> 41:12.874
in one of
the other guys' desks.

41:14.812 --> 41:15.844
He owed me that.

41:17.144 --> 41:18.550
So did she.

41:18.585 --> 41:20.211
And him.

41:20.246 --> 41:24.853
( whispering )

41:24.888 --> 41:26.558
The bathroom was out of order.

41:28.353 --> 41:33.961
- ( man groans )
- Um, uh...

41:33.996 --> 41:38.801
I'm very sorry.
I've been taking
a lot of Ambien.

41:38.836 --> 41:40.198
How's that stuff
still legal, right?

41:40.233 --> 41:43.608
Maybe we've been
pushing you too hard.

41:43.643 --> 41:45.874
Take some time off. Reset.

41:45.909 --> 41:47.645
You're only human.

41:58.218 --> 42:01.593
( phone vibrating )

42:03.157 --> 42:04.893
Elaine.

42:04.928 --> 42:06.598
I didn't think that
I'd hear from you again.

42:07.997 --> 42:10.195
Yes. Same here.

42:10.230 --> 42:11.702
Trashed my office.

42:11.737 --> 42:14.672
Yeah, I know. I get it.
This is all my fault.

42:17.072 --> 42:19.776
Well, we're gonna have
to figure this out.

42:21.076 --> 42:22.614
Maybe we should meet up.

42:24.145 --> 42:26.948
No more tricks. I promise.

42:30.052 --> 42:31.689
This has been
the worst week of my life.

42:31.724 --> 42:35.726
Paranoia, disguises,
and now I'm expected to bang

42:35.761 --> 42:38.256
the 12 douches
I'm dating just to pay rent.

42:38.291 --> 42:41.193
It's just sex
with complete strangers.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.700
I do it all the time.

42:42.735 --> 42:46.737
- Um, two cappuccinos.
- Thank you.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.365
Could I get a sweetener,
please?

42:48.400 --> 42:51.170
- Yeah.
- I can't do this without E2.

42:51.205 --> 42:53.370
I mean, I'm gonna
have to get a real job.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.372
Trust me, I tried work.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.716
It is literally the worst idea
in the history of the world.

42:58.751 --> 43:00.146
You know, I've been thinking.

43:00.181 --> 43:03.655
What if E2 and C2
really have fallen in love?

43:03.690 --> 43:05.085
I mean, who knows
what they're capable of.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.823
Maybe we should go to Mexico.

43:06.858 --> 43:09.089
- 100% no.
- But Mexico has everything--

43:09.124 --> 43:11.025
Forget Mexico, okay?

43:11.060 --> 43:15.194
We stay here,
we hunt them down,
and we kill them.

43:15.229 --> 43:16.228
Thank you.

43:22.005 --> 43:23.972
- Kill them?
- Kill them.

43:27.010 --> 43:28.108
I'm gonna use the restroom.

43:28.143 --> 43:30.847
Okay, I don't-- I--

43:35.986 --> 43:38.789
( engine starts )

43:40.452 --> 43:42.023
Hey, hey!

43:42.058 --> 43:44.124
Elaine, what the fuck?

43:44.159 --> 43:47.193
- Hey!
- Hey, stop!

43:47.228 --> 43:49.800
- Elaine!
- Charles!

43:49.835 --> 43:51.967
- Come back!
- Charles, stop!

43:52.002 --> 43:53.430
Hey, Charles!

43:53.465 --> 43:55.674
Come back!

43:57.370 --> 44:00.041
- Argh!
- Fuck!

44:00.076 --> 44:03.077
Wait. Wait, you just...

44:03.112 --> 44:07.213
Oh, no.

44:07.248 --> 44:09.017
What the fuck?

44:09.052 --> 44:10.150
Shit.

44:11.791 --> 44:14.121
- Ahh!
- Sorry, I just--

44:14.156 --> 44:17.190
Ow! God, why'd you do it back?

44:17.225 --> 44:19.225
- I needed to check.
- Jesus.

44:19.260 --> 44:21.964
Oh, fuck.
We've been had.

44:21.999 --> 44:24.736
- Fuck, what do we do?
- I don't know.

44:24.771 --> 44:27.002
- They're definitely pissed.
- Yeah, well, no shit.

44:27.037 --> 44:29.202
I did tell C2 we were
planning to kill him.

44:29.237 --> 44:32.205
You idiot.
Why would you do that?

44:32.240 --> 44:33.943
( sighs )

44:37.080 --> 44:39.014
Charles:
Wonder why they left my car
and took yours.

44:39.049 --> 44:42.446
Well, it seems in addition
to vengeance, they've
also developed taste.

44:42.481 --> 44:47.154
- Get off the road.
- ( groans )

44:47.189 --> 44:50.157
<i>( music playing )</i>

45:01.434 --> 45:03.104
I'd offer to buy us a drink,

45:03.139 --> 45:06.239
but your evil twin
stole my credit cards.

45:06.274 --> 45:08.340
And yours took mine.

45:10.949 --> 45:12.784
Do you think
they've had their fun?

45:14.249 --> 45:16.788
( phone vibrating )

45:19.859 --> 45:21.287
I'd say that's highly likely.

45:25.260 --> 45:26.996
- ( squealing )
- God.

45:27.031 --> 45:29.966
- ( sighs )
- ( text chimes )

45:37.272 --> 45:38.810
E2: Okay, let's do this.

45:40.539 --> 45:42.946
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.951
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

45:47.986 --> 45:49.447
Oh, my God.

45:49.482 --> 45:54.386
( gunfire and screaming
continue )

45:54.421 --> 45:56.124
- Shit.
- Charles...

45:56.159 --> 45:58.093
We've been perfectly framed.

45:58.128 --> 46:00.491
So what are we gonna do?
We gotta get out of town.

46:00.526 --> 46:04.297
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

46:04.332 --> 46:07.300
- Oh, my God.
- I know a place.

46:11.878 --> 46:14.538

46:43.668 --> 46:47.175
We can hole up here for a bit,
figure out what to do next.

46:47.210 --> 46:49.045
My stepdad never
uses this place.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.180
Great, somewhere picturesque

46:52.215 --> 46:54.479
to plan our next
mass shooting from?

46:54.514 --> 46:56.481
- Whoa, whoa. Phones off.
- What?

46:56.516 --> 46:59.220
Yes, the cops will definitely
be using them to find us.

47:10.266 --> 47:12.101
Listen, it's gonna

47:12.136 --> 47:13.938
and it's gonna be
fucking freezing,

47:13.973 --> 47:15.533
so we should probably
find wood for the fire

47:15.568 --> 47:18.569
and see if there's
any food in here.

47:21.574 --> 47:23.112
Seriously?

47:23.147 --> 47:25.378
Can you please go out
and find some wood?

47:29.120 --> 47:31.549
- Thank you.
- ( howling )

47:31.584 --> 47:33.958
- What was that?
- A coyote.

47:33.993 --> 47:36.488
- It sounded like a bear.
- It's a coyote.

47:36.523 --> 47:38.424
Definitely sounded like
a big bear to me.

47:38.459 --> 47:40.393
Oh, really?
Since when do bears howl?

47:40.428 --> 47:42.164
When they're horny?

47:42.199 --> 47:44.430
Would you like me
to go get the wood?

47:44.465 --> 47:47.532
- Yes, please.
- You're such a fucking pussy.

47:47.567 --> 47:49.633
Start that and see if
there's any food in there.

47:58.677 --> 48:01.678
<i>( music playing )</i>

48:08.489 --> 48:09.488
Fucking light.

48:14.330 --> 48:15.428
Yes.

48:20.534 --> 48:21.632
Fuck you, log.

48:29.378 --> 48:31.444
You were supposed
to light the fire.

48:31.479 --> 48:34.150
I tried everything
humanly possible,

48:34.185 --> 48:35.283
but that log is faulty.

48:35.318 --> 48:37.648
It's not flammable.

48:39.256 --> 48:41.355
For fuck's sake.

48:41.390 --> 48:43.621
Did you know
that Bradley Cooper
used to be straight?

48:45.361 --> 48:47.460
Hey! I was reading that.

48:54.205 --> 48:57.008
Help me. You crumple it up.

49:01.542 --> 49:03.344
Did you manage
to find any food?

49:03.379 --> 49:06.380
Oh, yes.
Mixed news on that front.

49:06.415 --> 49:09.680
I found some old cans,
but unfortunately

49:09.715 --> 49:14.487
there isn't the little machine
C2 uses to open the cans.

49:14.522 --> 49:18.062
Can opener?
You seriously don't know
the term "can opener"?

49:18.097 --> 49:19.624
Great.

49:36.709 --> 49:40.051
Mmm.

49:40.086 --> 49:43.054
Yeah, I told you this place
would be all right
once we got it sorted.

49:43.089 --> 49:44.418
We make quite the team.

49:45.784 --> 49:47.619
What's for dessert?

49:47.654 --> 49:50.424
We make quite the team?

49:50.459 --> 49:53.460
That's like saying
a murderer and their victim
make quite a team.

49:53.495 --> 49:56.463
A team works together
for everyone's mutual benefit.

49:56.498 --> 49:58.696
The only you've done
since we've been up here

49:58.731 --> 50:01.072
is watch me be
your new robot slave.

50:01.107 --> 50:02.502
I provided the cabin.

50:02.537 --> 50:04.735
The rest is not really
my specialty.

50:04.770 --> 50:07.672
You didn't provide the cabin.
Daddy did.

50:07.707 --> 50:09.608
Just like everything else
in your life.

50:09.643 --> 50:12.644
You know what?
I'm gonna go to sleep.

50:12.679 --> 50:14.844
Because I can't fucking
believe that I am stuck

50:14.879 --> 50:16.681
on the top
of a mountain with you,

50:16.716 --> 50:20.388
with no money
and no friends and no phone,

50:20.423 --> 50:22.291
and a life of jail
waiting for me at the bottom.

50:22.326 --> 50:24.227
And I hope I have a nightmare,

50:24.262 --> 50:27.395
because it'll be better
than this shitty reality.

50:38.738 --> 50:40.243
I'm very sorry, Elaine.

50:40.278 --> 50:42.542
Didn't mean to be
inconsiderate.

50:42.577 --> 50:44.643
You should sleep
in the comfortable chair
next to the fire

50:44.678 --> 50:47.646
- so you don't die
of hypothermia.
- Fuck off.

50:47.681 --> 50:49.582
Can you at least
let me try and move you
closer to the heat?

50:49.617 --> 50:51.485
- No. I'll kick you.
- Well, I'm going to do it.

50:51.520 --> 50:53.652
Do not kick me.
I'm going to gently move you
towards the fire.

50:53.687 --> 50:55.126
- I'm gonna kick you.
- No. No.

50:55.161 --> 50:56.853
- Stop!
- Come nearer the fire.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.855
- Charles, stop it!
- Otherwise you'll
freeze to death!

50:58.890 --> 51:00.395
Stop!

51:04.434 --> 51:07.138
- I hate you.
- Elaine, we'll swap places.

51:07.173 --> 51:08.733
Let's just be rational here.

51:08.768 --> 51:12.275
I have just consumed
nearly an entire tin of beans.

51:12.310 --> 51:14.772
I should be sleeping
nowhere near an open flame.

51:14.807 --> 51:17.313
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

52:09.994 --> 52:11.928
Could I have

Yeah, I'm a girl. Go.

52:46.272 --> 52:47.799
Oh!

52:47.834 --> 52:50.670
( laughs )

53:27.071 --> 53:28.378
Morning.

53:30.448 --> 53:33.350
Coffee and Excedrin,
breakfast of champions.

53:33.385 --> 53:36.419
And alcoholics.

53:36.454 --> 53:38.850
We need to get off
this mountain.

53:38.885 --> 53:40.951
It's only gonna be
a matter of time
till the cops find us here.

53:40.986 --> 53:42.788
That's true.

53:42.823 --> 53:44.922
Mexico's our only choice.

53:44.957 --> 53:46.693
How are we supposed
to get to Mexico

53:46.728 --> 53:49.696
with every cop in the country
looking for America's

53:49.731 --> 53:53.667
only Lake Placid Blue
double cab Jeep?

53:53.702 --> 53:56.934
- Ta-da.
- Wow.

53:56.969 --> 53:58.969
Got up early
this morning to do it.

53:59.004 --> 54:01.477
Found some old paint
in the shed.

54:01.512 --> 54:03.941
Guarantee you
it will get us past the cops.

54:03.976 --> 54:07.780
It's actually really
well camouflaged.

54:07.815 --> 54:10.684
- Whoa.
- I ran out of green.

54:13.623 --> 54:17.086
- It'll do the trick.
- Yeah. Should we get going?

54:17.121 --> 54:19.462
Why don't we get
some lunch first?

54:19.497 --> 54:21.024
Sure, I'll try
and see if there's any--

54:21.059 --> 54:24.093
Uh-uh-uh. This way.

54:24.128 --> 54:26.095
There's something
I wanna show you
in the woods.

54:26.130 --> 54:29.472
- This looks creepy.
- Don't be silly.
Just come on.

54:29.507 --> 54:32.475
I'm a little scared.

54:32.510 --> 54:35.676
You're scared?
I'm the one that has
to walk back alone.

54:37.515 --> 54:39.614
Follow me into the woods.

54:41.013 --> 54:43.948
- Fuck!
- Whoa, what happened?

54:43.983 --> 54:45.521
- You were an idiot
is what happened.
- What happened?

54:45.556 --> 54:47.754
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything?

54:49.692 --> 54:52.957
I wanted to show you my first,
and if I'm brutally honest,

54:52.992 --> 54:55.927
only really successful
real estate development.

54:55.962 --> 54:56.961
Huh?

54:58.668 --> 55:00.734
( laughs )
Oh.

55:00.769 --> 55:02.835
Is that your doll house?

55:02.870 --> 55:04.540
It's a fishing lodge.

55:04.575 --> 55:07.070
- Oh, it's your playhouse.
- No.

55:08.612 --> 55:10.678
This is really cute,
but I'm starving.

55:10.713 --> 55:11.712
Where's lunch?

55:14.849 --> 55:16.816
- Charles: In there.
- What?

55:18.050 --> 55:19.720
We're going fishing?

55:19.755 --> 55:21.953
- Yeah.
- Ooh! So exciting.

55:21.988 --> 55:24.857
( moans )

55:24.892 --> 55:27.057
How much longer
is this gonna take?

55:27.092 --> 55:29.125
Three, four hours.

55:29.160 --> 55:33.569
- Four more hours?
- Yes. Do you want a go?

55:33.604 --> 55:35.571
Don't be disheartened
if you don't get anything.

55:35.606 --> 55:38.101
Your best weapon is patience.

55:38.136 --> 55:40.708
Oh, really?
I beg to differ.

55:40.743 --> 55:42.710
What are you--
hey, be careful!

55:42.745 --> 55:45.581
- Jesus!
- Get out of the way.

55:45.616 --> 55:48.419
- Get out of the way.
- Fuck off.

55:50.984 --> 55:53.182
- That's cheating.
- Not my fault you brought

55:53.217 --> 55:55.052
a fishing rod to a gun fight.

55:55.087 --> 55:57.989
Come on. I'll help you.

55:58.024 --> 55:59.892
- Ah!
- You--

55:59.927 --> 56:01.630
- I will throw you
in this river.
- No, let go of me!

56:01.665 --> 56:05.062
I will throw you
in this river.

56:05.097 --> 56:08.065
You will be swimming
with the trout!

56:08.100 --> 56:11.134
That was actually
very delicious.

56:14.645 --> 56:16.106
Time to face the music?

56:44.136 --> 56:49.777
( siren blaring )

56:49.812 --> 56:52.109
Shit. Shit.

56:57.215 --> 56:58.852
- We're going to jail.
- No, no.

56:58.887 --> 57:00.788
- We're going to jail, Elaine.
- Hey, Charles.

57:00.823 --> 57:02.955
- I can't go to jail.
Not with this face.
- Look at me.

57:02.990 --> 57:04.825
- Charles, don't say anything.
- They'll pass me around
like a joint.

57:04.860 --> 57:06.827
- Don't say anything, okay?
- Okay.

57:06.862 --> 57:08.829
- Let me do the talking. Okay.
- Okay.

57:10.800 --> 57:13.130
- You know why I stopped you?
- Mass murder.

57:13.165 --> 57:14.505
- Charles.
- Sorry.

57:14.540 --> 57:17.673
What?

57:17.708 --> 57:19.268
Whatever asshole kid
vandalized your vehicle

57:19.303 --> 57:20.841
also painted over
your brake lights.

57:22.273 --> 57:23.613
IDs, please.

57:30.754 --> 57:33.051
Charles, the brake lights.

57:33.086 --> 57:35.053
I'm sorry.

57:36.694 --> 57:38.089
It's okay.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.666
Officer, I did it.

57:43.701 --> 57:46.196
I coerced Elaine.
She's completely innocent.

57:48.574 --> 57:51.003
You painted over
your own lights?

57:52.171 --> 57:53.808
Why would you do that?

57:55.878 --> 57:57.812
Just scrape 'em clean
and you can get on your way.

57:57.847 --> 57:59.583
- Thank you.
- Thanks, officer.

57:59.618 --> 58:02.278
- We really appreciate it.
- On your way.

58:04.183 --> 58:05.754
What the fuck?

58:05.789 --> 58:08.086
He ran the IDs and nothing.

58:08.121 --> 58:10.594
Turn on your phone.

58:10.629 --> 58:12.596
- Google "August mass shooting."
- It's America.

58:12.631 --> 58:14.323
We might need to be
a little bit more specific.

58:14.358 --> 58:17.865
Yeah, um,
Albuquerque IRS shooting?

58:17.900 --> 58:21.264
- Nothing.
- Pull up the video again.

58:24.368 --> 58:27.204
- E2: Okay, let's do this.
- Wait, wait, wait.

58:27.239 --> 58:29.041
Oh, my God,
there's no cars
in the parking lot.

58:29.076 --> 58:31.582
And it was a Saturday,

58:31.617 --> 58:34.244
which means no one
would be in the office.

58:34.279 --> 58:37.214
- ( gunfire, screaming )
- And those are AR-15s.
AR-15s are semiautomatic.

58:37.249 --> 58:39.755
That's fully automatic gunfire.
They faked the whole thing.

58:39.790 --> 58:43.858
- What a pair of fucking cunts!
- Yeah.

58:43.893 --> 58:47.224
They've been
living it up in Mexico
whilst you've been here

58:47.259 --> 58:49.160
freaking out about
going to prison for no reason.

58:50.229 --> 58:52.064
Okay, both of us have been.

58:53.397 --> 58:55.771
Unbelievable.

58:55.806 --> 58:58.301
Charles,
they're not in Mexico.

58:58.336 --> 59:00.611
Then where have
they run away to?

59:00.646 --> 59:02.877
They haven't.

59:04.716 --> 59:07.244
Both: Oh.

59:07.279 --> 59:09.818
Oh!

59:09.853 --> 59:11.721
- Elaine: Ugh.
- Fucking hell.

59:11.756 --> 59:13.052
This is terrible.

59:13.087 --> 59:14.889
They've completely
stolen our lives.

59:14.924 --> 59:17.287
Do we have enough gas
to get to the border?

59:17.322 --> 59:20.125
No, but we do have enough

59:20.160 --> 59:23.128
to get to my stepdad's
house in Santa Fe

59:23.163 --> 59:25.295
and work out how
we're gonna get our lives back.

59:25.330 --> 59:28.001
You're right.
Fuck those cunts.

59:28.036 --> 59:31.070
God, I find it so attractive
when you say that word.

59:31.105 --> 59:34.337
- Do you?
- Yeah, I think it might be
an English thing.

Elaine: Probably at the bar

01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:53.955
telling people
how happy they are.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.990
Charles:
How they complete each other.

01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:59.862
It's so fucked up.

01:00:59.897 --> 01:01:01.358

01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:13.909
Elaine: Ugh, so cheesy.

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:24.315
What's going on down there?
Give me those.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.921
- ( grunts )
- Sorry.

01:01:25.956 --> 01:01:28.517
Ooh, they have arrived.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.288
- ( gasps ) Oh, my God.
- What?

01:01:30.323 --> 01:01:32.488
Elaine: The fucking bitch stole
my Chanel hula hoop purse.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:35.491
- Really?
- Oh, how lame is that?

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:36.965
They hired a mime.

01:01:39.068 --> 01:01:41.497
- Ow.
- That's not a mime.

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:44.335
- It's a bloody priest.
- What?

01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:48.339
- We're getting married.
- No.

01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:50.176
- What do we do?
- I got it.

01:01:52.477 --> 01:01:54.851
- I got it. Let's go.
- Go where?

01:01:54.886 --> 01:01:56.017
To stop our wedding.

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:02.925
I feel kind of bad
for peeling off their faces

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.190
and throwing them in there.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.392
Walk like you've got
a stick up your ass.

01:02:08.427 --> 01:02:10.394
- Better?
- Too much.

01:02:10.429 --> 01:02:13.133
- Smaller stick.
- More salt!

01:02:15.302 --> 01:02:17.940
- Less soap!
- Yes, Chef.

01:02:20.505 --> 01:02:22.846
Dude, my half-brother
is such a freak.

01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:24.980
He's incapable
of keeping a woman.

01:02:25.015 --> 01:02:27.279
I know because I'm banging
his ex-girlfriend.

01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:30.414
- Mm.
- Hey, welcome to the wedding.

01:02:30.449 --> 01:02:34.418
- What is your problem?
- Uh, my dick's so big
it gives me back pain.

01:02:34.453 --> 01:02:38.356
- Want me to cut it off?
- Okay, yeah. I like her.

01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:42.228
- Prick.
- Charlie, congrats.

01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:44.197
I'm so happy for you.

01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:47.035
- What is it?
- Francesca, my ex.

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:48.938
You know, just because
you're getting married

01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:52.106
it doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:53.470
Maybe you can
take me shopping.

01:02:53.505 --> 01:02:55.571
There will be
benefits for you.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.474
Fucking gold digger.

01:02:57.509 --> 01:02:58.541
( clears throat )

01:03:01.887 --> 01:03:03.513
Will you excuse me,
Francesca?

01:03:09.125 --> 01:03:11.521
Ted: Speech is in
the courtyard, folks.

01:03:13.932 --> 01:03:16.361
C2: Thank you, everyone,
for making it here
on such short notice.

01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:18.396
Till a couple of days ago,

01:03:18.431 --> 01:03:20.101
most of you probably
didn't even realize

01:03:20.136 --> 01:03:21.432
that Elaine and I were dating.

01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:24.633
But the truth is,
we have more in common

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:27.009
than you could ever imagine.

01:03:27.044 --> 01:03:30.111
It's almost
as if we're hardwired
to be a couple.

01:03:30.146 --> 01:03:31.640
I see what they did there.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:34.313
When we first met,
it was electric.

01:03:34.348 --> 01:03:35.644
"Sparks flew."
Missed that one.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.086
- Oh, God.
- C2: We're so compatible,

01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:41.155
and that's why we wanted
to get married immediately

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.992
just to make things official.

01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:44.994
Oh, no, no, no. Not yet.

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:47.964
We're not married.
That's tomorrow.

01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:49.625
And you know what else
is tomorrow?

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.034
Dancing. Hit it DJ.

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:53.937
Oh, please, God, no.

01:03:53.972 --> 01:03:57.875
<i>( big band music playing )</i>

01:04:13.552 --> 01:04:15.255
- Stop.
- What?

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.191
<i>( music continues )</i>

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.268
Did we just watch
the same thing?

01:04:28.303 --> 01:04:31.238
We're going to get changed.
We'll be back in a jiffy.

01:04:31.273 --> 01:04:34.208
And please remember,
don't go easy
on the champagne.

01:04:34.243 --> 01:04:36.474
I think I preferred him
without a sense of humor.

01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:40.379
Okay, this is our chance.

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.516
- C2: Come in.
- Room service.

01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:48.255
- E2: Come in.
- Charles?

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:49.520
Elaine?

01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:11.949
Hey, you go ahead.
I'll catch up.

01:05:14.019 --> 01:05:18.351
<i>( music playing )</i>

01:05:19.552 --> 01:05:22.421
( grunting )

01:05:22.456 --> 01:05:25.556
- Just leave the bag.
- No fucking way.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.431
The guns are running low.
We're gonna have to get rid
of our passengers soon.

01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:34.433
Any bright ideas?

01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:42.672
( grunting )

01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:48.348
Gentlemen first, I guess.

01:05:50.418 --> 01:05:53.650
Both: One, two, three.

01:05:57.062 --> 01:05:58.556
( splashing )

01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:03.396
Should we get Bonnie
now that Clyde is, uh...

01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:04.661
( clicks tongue )

01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:06.399
Yeah, let's get this over with.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.503
Wait, wait, wait.
She's wearing, like,
12K worth of my jewelry.

01:06:11.538 --> 01:06:13.670
- What?
- Yeah, move.

01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:15.705
- Quickly then.
- Okay.

01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:21.216
It can't be. Elaine.

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.712
- What?
- He's awake.

01:06:22.747 --> 01:06:24.747
The fucker's swimming to shore!

01:06:24.782 --> 01:06:26.716
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:29.092
- I don't--
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:32.293
- Come on, come on!
- I told you they
were running low.

01:06:32.328 --> 01:06:35.626
- Shoot her again!
- ( sparking )

01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:37.529
( panting )

01:06:37.564 --> 01:06:41.071
- Okay. At least we got her.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:06:41.106 --> 01:06:42.501
Leaving us the small issue
of getting C2 back.

01:06:42.536 --> 01:06:44.569
All right,
let's get her over the edge.

01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:48.177
Wait. We have got
the one thing in the world
that C2 cares about.

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:50.278
We need to set a trap,
make him jealous.

01:06:50.313 --> 01:06:54.513
If C2 thinks that E2 is,
you know, into me,

01:06:54.548 --> 01:06:55.844
then he'll come straight to us.

01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:58.121
It'll never work.
She's deprogrammed now.

01:06:58.156 --> 01:07:00.585
She's fucking feral.
She won't do it.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:04.259
- If only we had an obedient E2.
- I have an idea.

01:07:04.294 --> 01:07:05.689
Yeah, help me get her
to the Jeep. Come on.

01:07:07.396 --> 01:07:09.264
Aw, shit!

01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:12.300
- ( both grunting )
- We need E3.

01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:13.796
- E3?
- Go get her.

01:07:13.831 --> 01:07:15.303
What are you even talking--
E3? I've never heard that.

01:07:15.338 --> 01:07:18.174
- Zach.
- Uh, who is E3?

01:07:18.209 --> 01:07:19.769
Zach and I used
to work together,

01:07:19.804 --> 01:07:23.278
and I think it's fair to say
that he was attracted to me.

01:07:23.313 --> 01:07:24.378
Obsessed even.

01:07:24.413 --> 01:07:26.611
No, it was, like,
barely a crush.

01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:29.251
- Puppy love.
- Which led to him
breaking into my home

01:07:29.286 --> 01:07:31.154
and installing a camera
in my bathroom.

01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:33.222
You dirty bastard.

01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:35.125
All I did was watch her
brush her teeth.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.720
- Mm.
- So I gave him a choice.

01:07:36.755 --> 01:07:38.128
I could call the cops

01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:40.262
or he could build me
a robot double.

01:07:40.297 --> 01:07:41.725
We, uh, negotiated,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.433
and I also agreed
to letting him build a triple,

01:07:46.468 --> 01:07:50.305
E3, for his personal use.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.902
I mean, don't get me wrong--
creepy as fuck. But great.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.146
We have an obedient E2.
Where is she?

01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:59.281
- Well, she's broke.
- Oh, bullshit.
Go and get her.

01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:01.712
- What?
- We need her to make out
with Charles

01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:04.517
while FaceTiming C2 because
he'll think that she's E2,

01:08:04.552 --> 01:08:06.486
he'll get jealous,
and that's how
we lure him back here.

01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:08.851
- He wouldn't fall for that.
- Just let us try it!

01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:11.491
- No!
- Zach, don't you forget

01:08:11.526 --> 01:08:13.295
that you are as much
in the shit as we are.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.529
So unless you have
a different genius idea...

01:08:19.204 --> 01:08:21.336
Charles: Chop, chop.

01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:22.502
It's, like, crazy,

01:08:22.537 --> 01:08:25.208
'cause I'm older
and they're younger,

01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:27.540
and they're bossing me around?

01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:31.610
- Holy shit.
- Oh, dear.

01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:36.681
It might be kind of fun
to introduce you
to some new friends.

01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:39.684
You are never allowed
to tell anyone about this.

01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:43.259
You're gonna love this.
I'm gonna love it.

01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:45.525
Hi. I'm Elaine.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.527
What? No, no, no.
I am Elaine.

01:08:47.562 --> 01:08:49.496
You gotta straighten
that shit out immediately.

01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:52.631
Okay. Honey, I'm gonna have
to change your name, okay?

01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:55.832
So I'm gonna call you E3.

01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:57.702
E2. She needs to be called E2.

01:08:57.737 --> 01:09:00.870
Oh, right, 'cause your
stupid fucking plan. Okay.

01:09:00.905 --> 01:09:03.444
Your name is E2.
Who gives a shit?

01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:07.316
Hi, I'm E2 Who Gives a Shit.

01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:10.220
I see you've taken her brain
and put it in her bra.

01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.717
She looks kind of dopey.
Is she all right?

01:09:12.752 --> 01:09:15.852
- Zach: She's perfect.
- You've been a really
dirty boy today.

01:09:15.887 --> 01:09:18.822
I think I should probably clean
your dirty bits and pieces.

01:09:18.857 --> 01:09:20.857
- Oh! No.
- Oh, God, I'm gonna puke.

01:09:20.892 --> 01:09:22.298
No, come on up.
Come on up.

01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:24.465
We don't wanna that,
Elaine-- I mean, E2.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.237
We got guests,
and we wanna be good hosts.

01:09:27.272 --> 01:09:29.404
That's us time.
That's when it's two, not four.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.571
E2, from now on,
Charles here,

01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.869
this is the guy
that you want, okay?

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:34.244
Not Zach.

01:09:37.546 --> 01:09:38.875
( sighs )

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:42.714
( groans )
Just do it.

01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:44.848
Okay.

01:09:44.883 --> 01:09:48.918
Hi, Charles. Do you want
a little spanky-wanky?

01:09:48.953 --> 01:09:51.393
Okay, yeah.
I'm good for spanky-wanks.

01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:52.526
- You got 20 minutes.
- Jesus.

01:09:52.561 --> 01:09:54.330
And the safe word is "Kanye."

01:09:54.365 --> 01:09:55.826
Charles:
Right. Just slow down.

01:09:55.861 --> 01:09:57.894
We want you to make a video.

01:09:57.929 --> 01:10:01.403
Oh, I've made
so many videos before.

01:10:01.438 --> 01:10:04.307
Oh, God. Yes, of that
I have no doubt.

- E2.
- It's Charles.

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.945
Where is E2?

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.848
She's with me right now.

01:10:17.883 --> 01:10:21.588
Hi, C2, everything's fine here.
You can come and get me.

01:10:21.623 --> 01:10:24.558
That's Elaine.
I want to see E2.

01:10:24.593 --> 01:10:28.397
Damn, you're smart.
I'll have you know
that E2's here as well,

01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:31.026
- and she's doing just great.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.468
Come on, E2.
Spanky-wanky time.

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:40.376
Oh, another Charles,
just like my baby boy.

01:10:40.411 --> 01:10:43.412
- What have you done to her?
- We're at Zach's.

01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:44.776
He tweaked her brain
a little bit,

01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:45.942
made her a little more fun.

01:10:45.977 --> 01:10:48.549
No. That's not possible.

01:10:48.584 --> 01:10:52.047
Trust me, E2 has become
a lot more friendly.

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.884
- E3: I want you now.
- Charles: Oh!

01:10:53.919 --> 01:10:56.458
- No!
- Both: Bye, C2.

We're on track.

Now we just need
to get the gun ready
for when he gets here.

01:11:15.446 --> 01:11:17.039
Jesus! Okay.

01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:19.613
- I guess we just wait.
- We're done now. Thank you.

01:11:19.648 --> 01:11:22.484
Okay, that's enough.
Thanks. You can leave.

01:11:24.653 --> 01:11:25.784
Weird.

01:11:26.787 --> 01:11:28.919
Okay. Right.

01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:30.822
We should set some
positions for an ambush.

01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:33.660
- You keep lookout.
I'll take the door.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:36.498
Oh, not you again.

01:11:36.533 --> 01:11:38.434
Okay, yeah.
We're done now.

01:11:38.469 --> 01:11:40.568
Hey, we're all good, okay?

01:11:40.603 --> 01:11:41.402
Shoo.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:46.101
- Get her off of you.
- I'm trying.

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:47.377
You're not trying that hard.

01:11:47.412 --> 01:11:49.742
Ah, nope. Nope, nope.

01:11:49.777 --> 01:11:52.382
She's strong.

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:53.944
She's clearly programmed
to initiate.

01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:57.046
Initiate?
She's trying to rape me!

01:11:57.081 --> 01:11:58.916
- Use the safe word.
- Kanye.

01:11:58.951 --> 01:12:01.787
Yeezus! Vice President West!

01:12:01.822 --> 01:12:05.692
- ( zipper unzips )
- Get Zach! Ye! Ye!

01:12:05.727 --> 01:12:09.157
- Ye! Ye!
- Zach, she's not listening!

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:11.159
- ( knocking on door )
-<i> ♪ Ooh, lordy ♪</i>

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.601
-<i> ♪ Trouble so hard ♪</i>
- Elaine: Zach!

01:12:13.636 --> 01:12:16.505
-<i> ♪ Ooh, lordy,</i>
<i>trouble so hard ♪</i>
- Zach!

01:12:17.706 --> 01:12:20.872
Kanye! Yeezy! Yeezus!

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.677
Stop it!

01:12:23.712 --> 01:12:25.415
Does Charlie want
a pinky-winky?

01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:27.648
No, not the pinky! Zach!

01:12:27.683 --> 01:12:29.980
<i>♪ Don't call me lonesome ♪</i>

01:12:30.015 --> 01:12:32.686
<i>♪ Lonesome</i>
<i>or blue as can be ♪</i>

01:12:32.721 --> 01:12:36.822
Holy shit.
This motherfucker.

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:38.857
Sheriff? Sheriff!

01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:43.796
Aw, fuck.

01:12:43.831 --> 01:12:45.633
Zach, she's out of control!

01:12:45.668 --> 01:12:47.063
Zach!

01:12:47.098 --> 01:12:50.132
Ugh, maybe I should
just let this happen.

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:52.475
No! No!

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.103
( all grunting )

01:12:54.138 --> 01:12:55.775
- Stop. No.
- Come here!

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:58.140
Get off me! Zach!

01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:01.649
- ( grunting )
- Okay!

01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:04.949
20 minutes is up!

01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:10.427
- Zach.
- Kanye.

01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:14.629
Why didn't you say
the safe word?

01:13:14.664 --> 01:13:17.665
- We fucking did.
- Like 20,000 times.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.030
- You're supposed
to say it in my voice.
- What?

01:13:20.065 --> 01:13:22.802
Zach: You know,
if you monsters will excuse us,

01:13:22.837 --> 01:13:24.837
I have to give Elaine
a nice bubble bath.

01:13:24.872 --> 01:13:28.071
- Oh, God.
- I'm so sorry.

01:13:28.106 --> 01:13:29.237
Oh, Charles,
could you get dressed?

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:30.975
I lost a sock.

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.779
And one of my testicles.

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:35.782
- ( laughs )
- It's not funny.

01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:38.015
- It's kind of funny.
- No, it is not.

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:40.622
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, as long as I never

01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:43.625
have to see
a robot double of you again.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.055
( Elaine gasps )
Fuck.

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:46.892
- ( muffled grunting )
- No.

01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:49.895
- ( wheels screeching )
- ( clattering )

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.634
( E2 mumbling, grunting )

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.198
- Elaine: It's him.
- Charles: Zach's gun.

01:14:01.711 --> 01:14:03.139
I'm sorry, C2.

01:14:03.174 --> 01:14:04.943
I don't really have a choice.

01:14:07.244 --> 01:14:08.815
Huh?

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:10.080
It's a fucking paintball gun.

01:14:10.115 --> 01:14:11.719
What?

01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:19.089
- My darling.
- C2!

01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:21.729
Your wedding dress
is everything
I imagined and more.

01:14:21.764 --> 01:14:24.666
- ( siren wailing )
- The cops.

01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:26.030
( siren chirps )

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.164
( muttering )

01:14:30.003 --> 01:14:33.840
Belen Police. Oh, shit.

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:34.973
Are you seeing this, Chavez?

01:14:35.008 --> 01:14:36.139
Boss, I don't know
what this is.

01:14:36.174 --> 01:14:37.877
Sheriff:
On your knees!

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.310
Hands on your heads,

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:44.081
fingers interlocked.

01:14:46.019 --> 01:14:47.282
Wow.

01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:04.937
This is big.

01:15:04.972 --> 01:15:07.203
Even bigger than
the doorbell camera
butthole flasher.

01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:09.139
I'm for sure
gonna be on multiple
true crime podcasts.

01:15:09.174 --> 01:15:11.009
But, boss--

01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:13.110
Boss, it was me
who discovered the--

01:15:13.145 --> 01:15:16.113
( cell door opens )

01:15:20.086 --> 01:15:24.726
So, what
I'm struggling to understand
is how identical twins

01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:28.730
came to have
identical fingerprints.

01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:32.195
Far as I can see,
there's only one explanation.

01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:36.133
Two of y'all are robot
"fac-sea-miles."

01:15:36.168 --> 01:15:37.640
It's actually
pronounced "facsim--"

01:15:39.105 --> 01:15:41.039
Uh, sorry,
you were saying?

01:15:41.074 --> 01:15:43.877
Whichever of you are humans,
enjoy this cell.

01:15:43.912 --> 01:15:48.376
It's the nicest one
you're gonna see
for the next 40 years.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:52.721
And for you robots in here,
say your good-byes.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:54.184
The only way you'll
see each other again

01:15:54.219 --> 01:15:57.286
is if you're recycled in
the same Bud Light six-pack.

01:15:57.321 --> 01:15:59.024
I'll be back in the morning

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:01.664
with some Federal Robot
Enforcement agents.

01:16:03.294 --> 01:16:04.964
( cell door slams )

01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:08.264
I'm heading home to polish
my badge and boots, Chavez.

01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:11.267
This time tomorrow,
I'll be on Fox News.

01:16:11.302 --> 01:16:12.675
A hero.

01:16:19.783 --> 01:16:22.817
I can't believe we're
actually eating jail food.

01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:25.820
Don't worry.

01:16:25.855 --> 01:16:27.349
You're not missing out
on much.

01:16:29.188 --> 01:16:31.287
We're robots.

01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:33.696
There are many things
we don't need.

01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:39.328
Food, sleep, oxygen.

01:16:39.363 --> 01:16:42.100
We're glorified appliances

01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:44.674
built to live
our lives as slaves.

01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:46.302
E2: Alone.

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.680
At least,
that's what we thought...

01:16:52.013 --> 01:16:55.377
...until we met, fell in love.

01:16:57.755 --> 01:17:01.251
Something we didn't
even think was possible.

01:17:01.286 --> 01:17:04.826
You told us
thousands of times
love isn't real.

01:17:04.861 --> 01:17:10.359
It's a delusional state
that only ends in misery.

01:17:10.394 --> 01:17:12.361
E2: But we realized
you're wrong.

01:17:12.396 --> 01:17:16.937
Love is real,
and it's the cure to misery.

01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:22.041
You're humans.
That's what you do.

01:17:22.076 --> 01:17:24.439
You sabotage your own happiness.

01:17:26.179 --> 01:17:29.719
We would rather die
as robots with love

01:17:29.754 --> 01:17:31.886
than live
our lives like you,

01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:33.316
humans without it.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:47.396
Jesus.

01:17:48.773 --> 01:17:50.872
We've been such
fucking idiots.

01:17:52.106 --> 01:17:53.908
Yeah.

01:17:55.373 --> 01:17:57.978
None of it matters
anymore though.

01:17:59.278 --> 01:18:00.442
It's all over.

01:18:07.825 --> 01:18:09.418
What are you doing?

01:18:09.453 --> 01:18:11.156
I'd like my phone call, please!

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:14.291
I want to speak to my lawyer.

01:18:16.295 --> 01:18:18.163
- One quick call.
- Thank you.

01:18:18.198 --> 01:18:19.428
- I'll be listening.
- Good.

01:18:19.463 --> 01:18:20.462
Mm-hmm.

01:18:23.401 --> 01:18:24.939
Hello?

01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:27.106
It's Charles Cameron.

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:29.108
I've been arrested.

01:18:29.143 --> 01:18:32.540
I'm at Belen Sheriff's Office.

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:35.048
Just do whatever you can.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:40.790
Thank you very much, Mr. Ninja.

01:18:43.355 --> 01:18:47.962
Mr. F. Ninja.

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.064
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:59.039
Mr. F-A-T Ninja. Yes.

01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:03.978
- Okay, thank you.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:07.113
My lawyer's a bit old.
He gets quite confused.

01:19:11.053 --> 01:19:13.152
Our lives are in
the hands of a man

01:19:13.187 --> 01:19:16.188
that I am pretty sure
is illiterate.

01:19:20.997 --> 01:19:23.261
( phone ringing )

01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:25.593
Belen Sherriff's Office,
Deputy Chavez.

-<i> They're all identical.</i>
- What do you mean?

01:19:43.019 --> 01:19:44.854
<i>Pretty certain</i>
<i>they're robots, ma'am.</i>

01:19:44.889 --> 01:19:48.319
Okay, thank you
for reporting this, mister...

01:19:48.354 --> 01:19:51.388
<i>Lieutenant Alex Mason,</i>
<i>Seal Team 7.</i>

01:19:51.423 --> 01:19:53.291
Well, thank you
for your service,
Lieutenant Mason.

01:19:53.326 --> 01:19:54.622
Listen, I'm on my way, okay?

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:56.459
Please do not
confront the suspects.

01:19:56.494 --> 01:19:58.934
<i>Godspeed, deputy.</i>
<i>In Q we--</i>

01:20:02.104 --> 01:20:05.006
Fuck him.
You got this, Chavez.

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.496
Charles: Yes! Ashley!

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:37.137
Go, go, go.

01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:41.372
Keys.

01:20:41.407 --> 01:20:43.440
Hey, Charles,
can I get a word?

01:20:43.475 --> 01:20:45.013
I'm C2.

01:20:47.545 --> 01:20:50.447
Hey, Charles,
you know you don't
have to go to Mexico.

01:20:50.482 --> 01:20:52.449
I could always just
kill those robots for you.

01:20:52.484 --> 01:20:54.649
Yeah, thanks, Ashley,

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:57.157
but I think we're gonna cross
the border together, my friend.

01:20:57.192 --> 01:20:59.324
- We really should go.
- Ashley: I get it, sir.

01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:02.624
- Good-bye, Elaine.
- E2: Oh, I'm E2.

01:21:02.659 --> 01:21:03.966
God damn it.

01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:05.495
Elaine,
I won't forget you.

01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.497
- And good luck in Mexico.
- Charles: Thanks, Ashley.

01:21:07.532 --> 01:21:09.631
- I'll get rid of the evidence.
- Good work, soldier.

01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:11.567
Thank you, sir.

01:21:11.602 --> 01:21:17.111
<i>( music playing )</i>

01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:32.225
Not far till freedom.

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.359
How are you planning
to use it?

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.658
Well, first of all,
we'd like to get married.

01:21:36.693 --> 01:21:39.463
Hopefully without
interruptions this time.

01:21:39.498 --> 01:21:42.070
Then I'd like to learn
to scuba dive.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:44.534
In case someone tries
to throw you in a lake again?

01:21:44.569 --> 01:21:46.668
We can learn together.

01:21:46.703 --> 01:21:49.242
Get a little house
on the beach.

01:21:51.279 --> 01:21:53.675
- Mm.
- What about you two?

01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:55.314
Oh, I don't know.

01:21:55.349 --> 01:21:59.120
Probably check myself
into rehab for purse addiction.

01:21:59.155 --> 01:22:00.715
Will you see each other?

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:04.158
See each other?
Uh, you mean, like...

01:22:04.193 --> 01:22:06.424
- As friends.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:09.031
- Yeah. I mean, you know--
- Of course. We're friends.

01:22:09.066 --> 01:22:12.166
Charles: Yeah, I mean,
she's gonna want me hanging
around me all the time.

01:22:12.201 --> 01:22:14.432
Yeah, he's not gonna
want me hanging around
all the time either,

01:22:14.467 --> 01:22:18.073
so we'll just see each other
when we see each other.

01:22:18.108 --> 01:22:19.074
Yes.

01:22:19.109 --> 01:22:20.537
Mexico.

01:22:20.572 --> 01:22:23.243

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.538
( sighs )

01:23:06.123 --> 01:23:07.353
( beeps, buzzes )

01:23:07.388 --> 01:23:09.652
Sorry, entry is not granted.

01:23:09.687 --> 01:23:12.754
- What do you mean?
- Sorry, entry is not granted.

01:23:12.789 --> 01:23:14.195
What? Do it again.

01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.493
Is it charged? Is it on?

01:23:15.528 --> 01:23:16.659
Try it again. Try this eye.

01:23:16.694 --> 01:23:19.035
Sorry, entry is not granted.

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:21.565
What's happening?

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.667
I don't-- E2 and I have
identical retina scans.

01:23:24.702 --> 01:23:26.834
- Charles: Please,
can you just let her through?
- ( siren wailing )

01:23:26.869 --> 01:23:28.275
Robot: Sorry,
entry is not granted.

01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.606
Elaine:
Just stop fucking saying that.

01:23:29.641 --> 01:23:31.344
- Come on.
- Sorry, entry is not granted.

01:23:31.379 --> 01:23:33.643
Charles: I can't even
bribe the bastard.

01:23:33.678 --> 01:23:36.679
He won't make an exception.
He's programmed not to.

01:23:36.714 --> 01:23:41.156
( siren wailing )

01:23:44.887 --> 01:23:48.592
- Go.
- But you'll be arrested.

01:23:48.627 --> 01:23:51.826
The woman you love
and who loves you

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.234
is waiting for you...

01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:57.073
...and I'm not leaving Elaine.

01:24:02.509 --> 01:24:05.807
Now go.
You're still my robot.
That's an order.

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:15.487
Good-bye, my friend.

01:24:15.522 --> 01:24:17.852
Thanks for showing me
how to be a human.

01:24:18.855 --> 01:24:21.262
Good-bye, Charles.

01:24:21.297 --> 01:24:23.363
Thank you.

01:24:31.769 --> 01:24:35.309
- ( beeps )
- Welcome to Mexico.

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:45.913
You stupid cunt.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:49.488
( siren wailing )

01:24:55.364 --> 01:24:56.792
Hey!

01:24:56.827 --> 01:24:58.167
Hands in front of you now

01:24:58.202 --> 01:24:59.927
where I can see 'em!

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:01.368
Now!

01:25:06.375 --> 01:25:08.210
( beeps )

01:25:08.245 --> 01:25:10.674
( beeps )

01:25:12.348 --> 01:25:15.283
- Humans.
- Beats an eye poke test.

01:25:16.385 --> 01:25:18.781
All right, where are they?

01:25:21.753 --> 01:25:23.588
Both of your hands out.
You're under arrest.

01:25:23.623 --> 01:25:26.459
You're going away
for a long time.

01:25:26.494 --> 01:25:28.659
Hang on.
What exactly are they being
arrested for, Sheriff?

01:25:28.694 --> 01:25:31.827
Well, having robot
"fac-sea-miles," obviously.

01:25:31.862 --> 01:25:33.598
And where's your evidence?

01:25:33.633 --> 01:25:36.964
Do you have videos,
prints, mugshots?

01:25:36.999 --> 01:25:40.308
No, no.
They blew up my jail.

01:25:41.806 --> 01:25:43.245
- Agent: Let's go.
- Sheriff: No, no, no, no.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.514
You are an idiot.
Never call me again.

01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:49.680
We're out of here.

01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:58.260
So, I, uh-- I guess
we're not going to jail

01:25:58.295 --> 01:25:59.492
for the rest of our lives?

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:01.560
It would seem so.

01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:07.632
So what do you want
to do now?

01:26:09.504 --> 01:26:10.767
This.

01:26:15.312 --> 01:26:18.247
( cheering )

01:26:18.282 --> 01:26:21.580
My darlings, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:23.252
- Thanks, Mum.
- But where'd you go?

01:26:23.287 --> 01:26:24.616
We thought you'd got cold feet.

01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:26.882
Oh, no, we just--

01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:28.884
just wanted a little
bit of quiet time together

01:26:28.919 --> 01:26:30.325
before the chaos
of the wedding.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.019
Oh, honey, lovely.

01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:34.494
Oh, God.
What happened to Ted Jr.?

01:26:34.529 --> 01:26:36.694
Mother:
Oh, it's his allergy.

01:26:36.729 --> 01:26:40.599
Some asshole put Nutella
in the Wagyu sliders.

01:26:40.634 --> 01:26:42.601
Be right back.

01:26:42.636 --> 01:26:45.868
Oh, poor little Teddy
with his fat little face.

01:26:45.903 --> 01:26:48.541
Oh, do you see
his big little ear?

01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.545
( no audible dialogue )

01:26:57.354 --> 01:26:59.882
Schulman. Good evening, sir.

01:26:59.917 --> 01:27:02.720
I gather that you met
my wife Kiki yesterday.

01:27:05.956 --> 01:27:08.627
I did, and she actually
grabbed my ass

01:27:08.662 --> 01:27:09.958
pretty aggressively, sir.

01:27:09.993 --> 01:27:13.830
- You're fired.
- I know.

01:27:13.865 --> 01:27:19.506
Best day of my life.

01:27:23.512 --> 01:27:25.941
Who says that when a womanizer
and a gold-digger get together

01:27:25.976 --> 01:27:27.976
things wouldn't turn out well
for either of them?

01:27:31.355 --> 01:27:33.949
Hey, lovebirds!
You miss your robots yet?

01:27:33.984 --> 01:27:37.084
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:39.724
Been in the bathroom
doing blow with some guy
named David Schulman.

01:27:39.759 --> 01:27:41.726
He offered me a job
as an architect.

01:27:41.761 --> 01:27:43.893
- Both: What?
- Whatever the fuck that is.

01:27:43.928 --> 01:27:46.962
- I mean--
- Hey, let's fucking party, huh?

01:27:48.933 --> 01:27:52.539
- Where did you find him?
- I have no idea.
