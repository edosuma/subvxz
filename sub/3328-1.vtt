00:01.800 --> 00:04.268
(bell tolling)
PRIEST:
We commend to Almighty God

00:04.300 --> 00:06.768
our brother Warren Pendry.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.631
Earth to earth,

00:08.670 --> 00:09.364
ashes to ashes,

00:09.410 --> 00:11.605
dust to dust.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.507
The Lord bless him and keep him,

00:14.540 --> 00:19.375
the Lord lift up his countenance
upon him, and give him...

00:19.420 --> 00:21.149
If the Lord had
any sense at all,

00:21.180 --> 00:22.545
he would kick Warren Pendry
right up his ass

00:22.590 --> 00:25.548
and send him to a very
warm place indeed.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.251
(mourners murmuring)
This is a private ceremony.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.712
MAN:
Leave now.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.727
There's an injunction
against you.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.182
You can't be here.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.198
Not until I've paid
my respects, Lawrence.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.219
So you prefer to be arrested?

00:34.260 --> 00:36.069
No, no, I'd prefer,

00:36.100 --> 00:38.694
if you don't mind,

00:38.730 --> 00:40.334
to finish my business!

00:40.370 --> 00:41.394
(mourners exclaiming)
No, no, no, no,

00:41.440 --> 00:42.634
ladies and gentlemen, please.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.331
Don't go!
Don't run away!

00:44.370 --> 00:46.474
I'm an officer of the law!

00:46.510 --> 00:49.741
Or at least I was
an officer of the law,

00:49.780 --> 00:51.338
until this man's
clearly departed father

00:51.380 --> 00:54.315
set an army of
solicitors upon me,

00:54.350 --> 00:56.215
and they did a dance
on my reputation, did they not?

00:56.250 --> 00:57.547
You ruined your own career.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.285
This man,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.288
this man standing before you,

01:01.320 --> 01:03.481
he murdered his own wife Mary,

01:03.530 --> 01:05.350
and this sorry

01:05.390 --> 01:07.392
sack of bones
spent God knows how much money

01:07.430 --> 01:09.466
slandering me
for trying to bloody prove it!

01:11.700 --> 01:13.668
My case against you,
Lawrence,

01:13.700 --> 01:15.497
might be in tatters,

01:15.540 --> 01:19.306
but that doesn't mean that
he gets to go In the ground

01:19.340 --> 01:20.432
without somebody standing up

01:20.480 --> 01:22.801
and saying what
he truly, truly was.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.379
Hello, Warren.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.586
It's me.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.281
Lestrade.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.787
You thought you took
the you-know-what

01:36.830 --> 01:39.128
out of me, didn't you?

01:39.160 --> 01:41.526
You were wrong.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.702
(cooing)

02:00.580 --> 02:02.241
(sighs)

02:02.290 --> 02:03.518
You're supposed
to be at a meeting.

02:03.550 --> 02:06.257
You receive my text?

02:06.290 --> 02:07.712
"In pursuit of pigeons.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.581
Need you Washington
Square Park ASAP."

02:10.630 --> 02:12.848
What does that
mean, exactly?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.720
As I sat in that
church basement,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.523
the droning of
my fellow addicts

02:16.570 --> 02:17.764
had a powerful
hypnotic effect.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.233
I had a breakthrough.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.567
The problem at hand:

02:20.600 --> 02:21.760
three US. Attorneys

02:21.800 --> 02:23.506
have been murdered
In the last year,

02:23.540 --> 02:24.564
all of them involved
In the prosecutIon

02:24.610 --> 02:26.339
of a syndicate of pirates.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.439
Yes, I know.
I'm working on
the case, too.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.742
Well, precision
in all things, Watson.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.407
When one is constructing
a geometric proof,

02:31.450 --> 02:33.941
one must occasionally review
the givens.

02:33.980 --> 02:36.642
We believe_a man
called JeromIr Tomsa

02:36.690 --> 02:38.282
has been hired
by the Syndicate

02:38.320 --> 02:39.514
to carry out these murders.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.515
But we have no evidence

02:40.560 --> 02:42.687
linking him to the crimes
or the Syndicate.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.550
We have no idea _
how they are communIcatIng.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.696
Had no idea, I should say.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.924
What, you figured it out?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.621
They use carrier pigeons.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.694
(cooing)

02:51.730 --> 02:53.368
Carrier pigeons.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.765
I staked out
Tomsa's apartment,

02:54.800 --> 02:56.859
Lo and behold,
he had a visit from a bird

02:56.910 --> 02:58.559
with a message
strapped round its foot.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.407
He read the message,
he scrawled a reply,

03:00.440 --> 03:01.600
and he set
the beast free.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.676
I tracked it here.

03:03.710 --> 03:04.904
WATSON:
You can follow a pigeon?

03:04.950 --> 03:06.611
HOLMES:
You can.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.844
Now it's just a question
of waiting to see

03:07.880 --> 03:09.541
who comes along
to read the message.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.740
We'll have our connection.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.672
Hey, watch it!

03:49.430 --> 03:51.421
(indistinct conversations)

03:54.300 --> 03:55.756
(grunting)

03:59.770 --> 04:01.738
You've been tending
to your self-defense.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.260
Well done.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.699
(man wheezing)

04:07.510 --> 04:09.671
(indistinct radio communication)

04:11.610 --> 04:13.669
Department's got
six guys grinding this case,

04:13.720 --> 04:16.348
and you broke it open
by following a bird.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.880
Mm. Lost track
of it now, though.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.581
It's a shame to see all
that traInIng go to waste.

04:19.620 --> 04:20.655
What are you gonna do
with a carrier pigeon?

04:20.690 --> 04:22.282
(phone ringing)
You know what?

04:22.330 --> 04:23.683
I don't want to know.
Happy hunting.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.322
OFFICER:
Ms. Watson, can I
take a statement?

04:27.530 --> 04:28.792
Sherlock Holmes.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.339
Y-Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.337
What?

04:39.710 --> 04:40.802
Oh, yes, of course.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.398
Straightaway.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.648
(phone ringing)

04:47.680 --> 04:49.489
Do you have
a current passport?

04:49.520 --> 04:51.385
Uh, yes. Why?

04:51.420 --> 04:52.853
Before I came to New York,
I worked with

04:52.890 --> 04:55.518
an Inspector Lestrade
at Scotland Yard.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.528
Just been informed he's got
himself in a spot of trouble.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.982
Needs my help.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.452
To give it to him,

05:00.500 --> 05:01.853
you and I will need
to go to London.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.858
My relationship with Lestrade
started as a marriage

05:31.890 --> 05:33.357
of convenience.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.549
When it came to those
at Scotland Yard

05:34.600 --> 05:37.125
who agreed to work with me,
he was the best

05:37.170 --> 05:38.489
of a bad bunch.

05:38.530 --> 05:39.736
He gave me access
to sensitive cases,

05:39.770 --> 05:40.964
I gave him answers.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.501
_ You never
mentIoned hIm before.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.508
We were never really that close.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.531
Besides the fact that
as a detective,

05:46.580 --> 05:47.729
he was utterly adequate.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.645
I could, at times,
be quite cutting

05:49.680 --> 05:51.500
in regards to his limitations.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.541
I was a different person
back then; I was less warm.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.138
Hmm. Less?

05:55.180 --> 05:56.818
Because I prefer
to work in anonymity,

05:56.850 --> 05:59.580
the glory of my casework
was accrued to him.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.985
Over the years,
he became

06:01.020 --> 06:03.727
accustomed to the spotlight.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.058
Inevitably,
he began to... crave it.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.648
You might say
I turned him into an addict.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.668
Unfortunately for him,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.497
by that time,
I was myself

06:11.530 --> 06:13.669
wrestling with
my own far less
metaphorical

06:13.700 --> 06:15.167
addictions.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.100
(sighs)
So...

06:17.140 --> 06:18.562
he was exposed.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.430
You feel guilty.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.970
I'm well aware of the corrupting
power of the spotlight.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.602
I avoid it at all costs,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.606
and yet I-I offered
Lestrade up to it

06:25.650 --> 06:27.015
like a sacrificial lamb.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.644
Was he the one
who called you?

06:29.690 --> 06:31.612
Nope.
DCIHopHns

06:31.650 --> 06:33.015
Another ex-colleague.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.652
He said, uh,

06:34.690 --> 06:35.987
Lestrade had got himself
into a spot of trouble,

06:36.020 --> 06:37.658
issued a few threats.

06:37.690 --> 06:38.679
The police have had trouble
locating him,

06:38.730 --> 06:39.958
so our mutual friend

06:40.000 --> 06:41.695
thought I might be able
to lend a hand.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.459
_ It sounds like
thIs Is very personal.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.660
Are you sure you want me
to come along?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.019
Well, without you,
the airline might

06:46.070 --> 06:47.867
seat me next to
a morbIdly obese person.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.504
Or a child.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.031
Or a morbidly
obese child.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.628
WATSON: You know, when I first
started working with you,

06:53.680 --> 06:57.172
you mentioned that you
left London in disgrace.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.098
Have you thought about
what it's gonna be like

06:59.150 --> 07:00.640
when you go back there?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.489
I'm a different man now, Watson.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.738
It's a different city.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.611
London is always
a different city.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.651
*

07:26.610 --> 07:29.431
*

07:39.760 --> 07:42.149
*

07:55.170 --> 07:56.831
You know, I was thinking,
since we're in London,

07:56.870 --> 07:58.235
this might be
a good opportunity

07:58.270 --> 07:59.931
to work on step nine.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.504
Step nine?

08:01.540 --> 08:02.768
You think I should
start making amends

08:02.810 --> 08:04.778
to people I have
harmed now?

08:04.810 --> 08:06.573
Well, this...
this Lestrade guy

08:06.620 --> 08:07.644
seems like he qualifies.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.544
HOLMES:
DCI Hopkins.

08:10.590 --> 08:11.579
Good to see you.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.550
Good God, man.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.854
You look exactly
the same.
As do you.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.187
Save for the fact
that you've gained

08:18.230 --> 08:19.993
exactly one and
a quarter stone

08:20.030 --> 08:21.657
and your hairline's
receded half a centimeter.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.725
Hey, you're slipping.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.726
I've gained exactly
one and a half stone.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.067
Oh, I'm not slipping;

08:27.100 --> 08:28.636
I've just grown
more courteous.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.738
His name's
Lawrence Pendry.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.101
Son of Warren Pendry.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.277
HOLMES:
British media mogul.

08:36.310 --> 08:37.902
Owns half the papers
in England.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.577
Owned.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.678
Died last week,
heart attack.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.711
But we'll get to that.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.581
13 months ago,
Lawrence here,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.019
he dialed 999 to say that

08:46.050 --> 08:47.256
he and his wife
walked in on

08:47.290 --> 08:48.780
an_ armed intruder
In theIr home.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.254
There was a struggle
between Lawrence and the man,

08:51.290 --> 08:54.191
and the man's weapon fired,
killing Mary.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.790
Lestrade caught
the case,

08:56.830 --> 08:58.661
and he took
an instant dislike

08:58.700 --> 09:00.565
to Pendry;
thought his statement

09:00.600 --> 09:01.498
sounded rehearsed,

09:01.540 --> 09:03.132
convinced himself
that the scene was staged.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.003
Trouble was,
a neighbor heard the shot

09:06.040 --> 09:09.100
that killed Mary
at exactly 18:33.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.179
Pendry dialed 999
at 18:36.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.812
Our_ first _car arrived
not We mInutes later.

09:14.850 --> 09:17.819
Yet no gun was recovered
at the scene.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.284
So if Lawrence killed Mary,

09:20.320 --> 09:21.787
then he had
to get rid of the gun

09:21.820 --> 09:23.048
in that eight-minute period.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.654
(boat horn blares)

09:27.700 --> 09:31.591
After you left for the States,
Lestrade struggled.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.837
Cut some corners...

09:33.870 --> 09:35.235
Whatever it took
to close a case.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.865
Warren Pendry
proceeded to use his papers

09:38.910 --> 09:40.878
to paint a very ugly picture,

09:40.910 --> 09:43.242
not just of Lestrade,
but of the Yard in general.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.601
DCS had no choice
but to suspend Lestrade,

09:45.650 --> 09:47.345
pending an investigation.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.779
When was this?

09:48.820 --> 09:49.980
Two weeks ago.
Now, back to Warren...

09:50.020 --> 09:52.750
His funeral was
three days ago.

09:52.790 --> 09:57.750
Lestrade used this
to make an appearance.

09:57.790 --> 10:00.054
It's a fake.
Nevertheless,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.795
it's landed Lestrade

10:01.830 --> 10:03.229
in a whole new world
of trouble.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.625
There's been a manhunt
the last few days,

10:05.670 --> 10:06.637
but it's turned up nothing.

10:06.670 --> 10:07.989
Do you think he did it?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.008
At least two dozen mourners
saw the whole thing.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.167
I'm not talking about Lestrade,
I'm talking about Pendry.

10:12.210 --> 10:13.905
Either way,
it's not your concern.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.168
I haven't asked you
here to consult,

10:15.210 --> 10:17.201
I asked you here
to find him.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.777
MAN:
DCI Hopkins!

10:20.820 --> 10:22.117
We still on for our meeting?

10:22.150 --> 10:24.118
Oh, Mr. Pendry,
you're early.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.947
Well, I am being stalked
by all of your colleagues.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.981
You can't blame me
for beIng early for
an update, can you?

10:30.430 --> 10:33.126
This is Mr. Holmes,
who, with his associate

10:33.160 --> 10:35.890
Miss Watson, are assisting in
our search for Gareth Lestrade.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.961
I know you.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.059
YouTe
Lestrade's crutch.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.658
Sorry, it's just...

10:43.710 --> 10:45.029
over the course
of the past year,

10:45.070 --> 10:46.901
my attorneys have
been compelled to do

10:46.940 --> 10:48.373
quite a bit of research
into Inspector Lestrade.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.776
One of the many secrets
they uncovered

10:50.810 --> 10:52.812
was that you were the architect
of his greatest successes.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.772
You give me
too much credit.
I think
you're the one

10:54.820 --> 10:56.913
who gave too much credit.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.383
Please don't misunderstand me,
Holmes, I...

10:58.420 --> 10:59.785
You're quite brilliant.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.310
I only wish you'd
been with Lestrade

11:01.360 --> 11:02.952
the night Mary was killed.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.220
Maybe the real killer
would be in prison...

11:05.260 --> 11:08.229
and the inspector would
still have his job.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.065
Thank you.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.204
So, uh, this is
your old place?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.969
2213 is

11:19.010 --> 11:20.830
my original
sanctum sanctorum.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.144
It is the only aspect
of my life in London

11:23.180 --> 11:25.239
that I have truly missed.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.714
Before I left for New York,
I came to an arrangement

11:27.750 --> 11:28.910
with an acquaintance,

11:28.950 --> 11:30.212
Geezer Bob.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.218
He's been maintaining
it in my absence.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.354
Hmm, it seems nice.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.486
What?

11:38.530 --> 11:41.897
2213 is a good deal
more than nice, Watson.

11:41.930 --> 11:44.160
I spent the best part of
ten years transforming it

11:44.200 --> 11:46.964
into a virtual _womb
of creatIVIty.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.969
Stepping inside it isn't unlike
stepping inside my very brain.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.102
You will no doubt see things

11:51.140 --> 11:52.971
that will confuse
or even upset you.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.170
Odd experiments,

11:54.210 --> 11:55.404
texts in dead languages,

11:55.440 --> 11:56.509
trophies from old cases.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.098
Does it have a bed?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.778
Because the only thing I care
about right now is sleeping.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.108
(footsteps echoing)

12:09.060 --> 12:11.255
Well.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.099
The inside_of
your braIn Is...

12:13.130 --> 12:14.358
kind of boring.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.254
These are not my things.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.961
I've been betrayed.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.195
Well, what do you expect
from a guy named Geezer Bob?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.162
I need to check upstairs!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.202
(footsteps echoing)

12:33.250 --> 12:35.343
MAN:
Can I help you?

12:36.920 --> 12:37.887
Geezer Bob?

12:37.920 --> 12:39.911
No.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.053
Would you care to explain
what you're doing in my home?

12:42.090 --> 12:43.887
HOLMES: Watson, our rest is
going to have to wait.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.852
We need to locate...

12:45.890 --> 12:47.551
My... God.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.454
Mycroft.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.821
Hasn't been that long, has it?

12:51.870 --> 12:53.337
WATSON:
Um...

12:53.370 --> 12:54.337
would someone like to explain

12:54.370 --> 12:56.065
what's going on here?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.034
Fatty, this is Watson.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.059
Watson, this is Fatty.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.032
Fatty?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.298
I'd say I'd slimmed down
quite a bit.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.442
Wouldn't you?
Lap-Band?

13:04.480 --> 13:05.276
Exercise.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.141
Exercise requires
energy and ambition.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.317
You've never had either.

13:08.350 --> 13:11.547
Miss Watson.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.558
It's... it's nice to meet you.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.387
I'm Mycroft.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.820
Mycroft Holmes.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.487
I'm Sherlock's brother.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.103
HOLMES: I can't believe
that my father gave 221B

13:31.140 --> 13:32.505
to Mycroft.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.405
He knows how much
thIs place means to me.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.475
It's his building, Sherlock.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.205
He can do whatever he wants.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.478
Frankly, I'm more interested
inmemd

13:38.510 --> 13:40.944
that you never mentioned
that you had a brother.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.447
Why would I?

13:42.480 --> 13:45.119
Um, because he's family?

13:45.150 --> 13:47.550
Our relationship is
entirely genetic.

13:47.590 --> 13:48.887
He's an embarrassment.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.525
Oh, apparently
your father

13:51.560 --> 13:52.891
doesn't think so.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.921
I-Is that why
you don't like him?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.928
Because he gets along
with your dad?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.528
I don't like him
'cause he's lazy.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.458
And he's never applied himself
to anything.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.432
What do you mean?

14:01.470 --> 14:02.494
As soon as he was able,

14:02.540 --> 14:04.201
he cashed in his trust fund.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.559
He opened several restaurants
around London.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.306
Okay, so he's a
restauranteur...

14:08.340 --> 14:11.275
No, he's an indolent man-child,
and if I'd had my druthers,

14:11.310 --> 14:12.504
you would never have
crossed paths with him.

14:12.550 --> 14:15.041
Well, we're here now...
Tea?

14:15.080 --> 14:17.344
Help yourself.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.009
What have you done
with my things?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.652
Charity shops.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.180
You're joking.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.481
I reached out
to you several tImes

14:24.530 --> 14:25.485
in New York
to make arrangements.

14:25.530 --> 14:26.519
You never got back to me.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.448
I was in rehab.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.967
They don't have phones in rehab?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.525
See what I mean? Lazy.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.391
Could have had my things
properly stored, but didn't.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.907
Must I confess,

14:36.940 --> 14:38.430
I don't enjoy being
ambushed in my own home.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.131
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Joan.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.636
My father's mentioned you
several times.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.977
May I call you Joan?

14:43.010 --> 14:45.069
Yes, of course.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.577
It's funny that Sherlock's
never mentioned me to you.

14:46.610 --> 14:47.542
I wonder why that might be?

14:49.550 --> 14:51.040
Th-This again? Seriously?

14:51.090 --> 14:53.183
Maybe it's because
the last time I saw him

14:53.220 --> 14:55.586
he was face-deep in my fianc.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.087
What?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.552
It was five years ago, right?

14:58.590 --> 15:00.455
I had deduced that she was
far less interested in him

15:00.500 --> 15:02.092
than in the family fortune.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.269
I tried to warn him.
He wouldn't listen.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.325
So I set about proving
my hypothesis.

15:06.370 --> 15:07.928
Seven times, if memory serves.

15:07.970 --> 15:09.562
Once in a pod
on the London Eye.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.228
I did you a favor.

15:12.270 --> 15:15.478
You did what you wanted,
Sherlock.

15:15.510 --> 15:18.502
Just like you always do.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.439
I'm jet-lagged, Sherlock.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.709
So if we're not gonna stay here,
we need to find a hotel.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.149
MYCROFI':
Nonsense.

15:28.190 --> 15:31.250
Sherlock and I may have
our differences,

15:31.290 --> 15:32.587
but we're still family.

15:32.630 --> 15:36.020
You can both stay
in the guest rooms.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.730
(whispering): We've been up
for over 20 hours.

15:41.770 --> 15:43.658
It's nice here.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.359
Fine, fine.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.332
Only because time is
of the essence.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.302
Good.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.205
I'll fetch you
some fresh towels.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.639
Thank you so much.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.648
Right.
Where are you going?

15:55.680 --> 15:57.682
I've devised a theory
as to how to find Lestrade.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.210
I'd like to test it.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.684
You stay here. Rest.

16:23.780 --> 16:26.271
This is your idea
of lamming it, is it?

16:29.150 --> 16:31.482
A few pints in the heart
of Greenwich?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.624
So the...

16:37.660 --> 16:41.528
prodigal detective returns.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.791
And how-how-how'd
you find me?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.308
Once I learned
you hadn't withdrawn any cash,

16:51.340 --> 16:53.399
I had a good notion
what you were up to.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.579
You and I looked
into the matter

16:55.610 --> 16:57.498
of the Norwood Builder
together, didn't we?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.302
And during the course
of that investigation,

16:59.350 --> 17:01.511
I revealed to you
that I kept five hidden caches

17:01.550 --> 17:03.586
around the city.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.508
In case of emergencies.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.654
Cash, various passports,
other sundries,

17:07.690 --> 17:10.523
stood to reason you'd make use
of those in your hour of need.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.620
Four of the five
have been cleaned out.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.254
The fifth is in a hollowed-out
sculpture on the grounds

17:16.300 --> 17:18.188
of the library
across the street,

17:18.230 --> 17:19.492
and will be difficult to access

17:19.530 --> 17:21.259
until the security guard
goes off-duty.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.565
Actually, you know,
I'm-I'm-I'm quite pleased

17:24.610 --> 17:26.703
you're here really.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.071
I think you'd
be most impressed

17:28.110 --> 17:29.737
with all the work
that I've done.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.704
I am not here to consult
on the case of Lawrence Pendry.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.071
I am here to make quite certain

17:35.120 --> 17:37.111
that you emerge from hiding

17:37.150 --> 17:38.640
without harming yourself

17:38.690 --> 17:39.839
or anyone else.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.585
I felt I owed you that

17:41.620 --> 17:43.724
for all the years of work

17:43.760 --> 17:45.819
that we did together, so...

17:45.860 --> 17:48.693
Are you going to come
to Scotland Yard with me?

17:48.730 --> 17:51.494
Or shall I call them here?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.299
So, who you working with
in New York then?

17:58.340 --> 17:59.364
Captain Thomas Gregson.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.402
Good detective, good man.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.702
Not as sharp as you,
obviously.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.547
(chuckles)
Nice.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.616
What are you...
what are you doing?

18:07.650 --> 18:09.743
Well, the security man is off,

18:09.780 --> 18:12.613
so I thought I might go and get
myself a little bit of cash.

18:12.650 --> 18:13.617
Aw, don't... Just get...

18:13.660 --> 18:15.651
Get off me!

18:21.160 --> 18:22.195
You're being ridiculous.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.720
This is my case.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.864
I'm gonna be there
when Pendry is nicked.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.733
I mean, how many... how many
times did you follow some...

18:29.770 --> 18:32.238
some bonkers theory...

18:32.270 --> 18:33.874
and you'd find that
it was a complete

18:33.910 --> 18:35.468
and utter bloody
waste of time?

18:35.510 --> 18:37.808
What, 50, what,
a hundred times?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.306
See, I never got the chance
to follow my muse.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.669
(groans)

18:40.720 --> 18:44.315
I never even had the chance
to have an opInIon.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.648
Look, I acknowledge I was not
always the most attentive

18:46.690 --> 18:48.715
of colleagues.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.854
It's actually something
I'm taking steps to improve.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.699
And what good does that do me?

18:53.730 --> 18:55.698
Well... _
You can turn me In.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.664
You can do whatever
you want to do.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.668
Personally...

18:59.700 --> 19:01.861
what I would prefer, Sherlock,

19:01.900 --> 19:05.666
is that if you and I
could work together

19:05.710 --> 19:07.575
just one last time.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.805
(Mycroft speaking French)

19:10.810 --> 19:13.347
(speaking French)

19:14.720 --> 19:16.244
One of my suppliers

19:16.280 --> 19:17.747
from the restaurant--
I'll be a moment.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.816
(Mycroft speaking French)

19:24.460 --> 19:25.859
Sorry.

19:25.890 --> 19:28.529
Um, have you seen
Sherlock aanhere?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.323
He never came home last night.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.190
Are you sure?

19:32.230 --> 19:33.436
His bed was undisturbed.

19:33.470 --> 19:34.767
You live with him.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.438
Surely you know he'd
never sleep in it,

19:36.470 --> 19:37.960
then make it.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.934
Yeah, I guess I'll
try calling him.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.949
You must be learning
a great deal from him.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.709
Iam.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.638
How else would you
put up with him?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.615
Uh, I don't "put up" with him.

19:50.650 --> 19:53.312
We get along, basically.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.713
He's a friend.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.729
Sherlock doesn't have friends.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.887
Yesterday I would've told you
he doesn't have a brother.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.192
But he does.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.926
Does he?

20:04.970 --> 20:07.461
He's changed a lot.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.695
People often say that
about addicts, don't they?

20:09.740 --> 20:12.629
"He's changed, he's better now."

20:12.670 --> 20:15.833
Sherlock is addicted
to being himself.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.700
(phone chimes)

20:17.750 --> 20:19.775
MYCROFI':
Our boy?

20:19.810 --> 20:21.016
Yeah, he's fine.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.348
Uh, I'm gonna get dressed,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.779
and, uh, I'll go meet him.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.851
(sighs)

20:27.890 --> 20:29.949
(knife clunks on cutting board)

20:31.890 --> 20:32.652
WATSON :
Hey.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.750
Why are we
in an abandoned theater?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.791
These places come and go
as public subsidies

20:37.830 --> 20:39.491
wax and wane.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.839
A good place to hide,
if you are a fugitive.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.968
Fugitive?

20:45.010 --> 20:47.433
Joan Watson meet
Gareth Lestrade,

20:47.480 --> 20:49.436
late of Scotland Yard.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.903
Uh... pleasure.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.941
Hi.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.918
Yeah, hi.

20:56.950 --> 21:00.681
Okay, you found him and then you
came back to his lair with him.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.880
Is there any particular reason

21:01.920 --> 21:02.955
why you haven't called
the police?

21:02.990 --> 21:04.457
Yes. Milk.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.422
Lawrence Pendry is
lactose intolerant;

21:08.460 --> 21:09.893
his wife Mary,
a committed vegan;

21:09.930 --> 21:13.639
so why, then, is there a bottle
of milk in their fridge?

21:13.670 --> 21:15.365
Guests?
Perhaps.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.607
LESTRADE:
Uh, miss, no offense,

21:17.640 --> 21:19.437
but could you give him
a little bit of space, please?

21:19.470 --> 21:20.778
Because he's doing that thing.

21:20.810 --> 21:21.777
You know, when he's
on to something,

21:21.810 --> 21:22.834
he does that-that thing.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.542
Yes, I-I know that thing.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.547
You didn't tell me that one
of your brother's restaurants

21:29.580 --> 21:31.684
had two Michelin Stars.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.982
(scoffs)
I didn't tell you

21:33.020 --> 21:34.317
that my brother
was a corporal entity.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.952
You've been chatting

21:35.990 --> 21:38.925
with Mycroft?
Yes, he wants
to take me to dinner.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.019
What?

21:41.060 --> 21:42.459
He intends to bed you.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.024
(sighs)

21:44.070 --> 21:45.822
Retaliation for my misadventures
with his fianc.

21:45.870 --> 21:48.862
Misadventures is not
the word that I would use.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.936
You are attracted to Mycroft.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.006
Um, no, I'm not.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.473
Hm. Makes a certain
amount of sense.

21:54.510 --> 21:55.829
It's classic
transference.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.575
You wouldn't be
sleeping with him.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.976
Psychologically speaking,
you'd be sleeping with me.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.910
Oh, you surely
thought about it.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.588
You can't go
to bed with me.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.917
We're business partners

22:04.950 --> 22:06.611
and you're my former
sober companion.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.857
But you can sleep with
a cheap knockoff version of me,

22:08.890 --> 22:10.585
and that is Mycroft.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.983
(sighs)
I don't even know

22:12.030 --> 22:14.021
what I'm supposed
to be looking for in here.

22:14.060 --> 22:17.325
One of these ma... one of these
masks Is out of place.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.966
They look pretty well
lined up to me.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.932
Yes, well,
they are "pretty well lined up,"

22:26.970 --> 22:28.506
but they were...

22:30.180 --> 22:31.909
...perfectly lined up.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.941
Mary Pendry took this photograph
of herself

22:33.980 --> 22:37.416
and e-mailed it to a friend,
just hours before she died.

22:37.450 --> 22:38.883
In it, the third mask
from the left

22:38.920 --> 22:40.649
is perfectly in line
with its compatriots.

22:40.690 --> 22:44.421
But this one,
it's just a little bit lower.

22:44.460 --> 22:45.984
Did you notice this
at the scene?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.952
The murder weapon
could be hidden here.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.955
Eh, did I notice
the discrepancy?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.524
Hm.
No.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.821
But we're not
complete IdIots.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.962
We did check
behind the mask,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.433
and there was
no gun there.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.869
I need to examine this room.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.436
Well, this is
not our case.

22:57.470 --> 22:59.461
Pendry's not
gonna just let
us walk in there.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.909
Well, he will when I tell him
that I almost

23:00.940 --> 23:02.976
caught his enemy Lestrade,

23:03.010 --> 23:04.671
and I found a suicide note
that he was writing

23:04.710 --> 23:06.007
in which he indicates
his intention

23:06.050 --> 23:07.745
to murder Lawrence Pendry.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.975
But I haven't written
any SUIClde notes.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.443
Not yet you haven't.

23:12.490 --> 23:16.688
PENDRY: "I die knowing that
I brought justice to Mary.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.087
I die vindicated,
a true policeman."

23:20.130 --> 23:21.859
Do you actually think
he'll follow through?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.924
Difficult to say.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.461
You might want
to take different

23:24.500 --> 23:26.468
routes to your office.
Inform your security.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.934
I'm-_I'm sure that
the po|Ice WIll be happy
to send someone over.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.938
With all due respect,
I'm protecting myself

23:30.970 --> 23:32.631
from a member of the police.

23:32.670 --> 23:33.932
I'm hardly likely to invite
more of them

23:33.980 --> 23:35.732
into my home.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.873
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

23:37.910 --> 23:41.038
We'll take_
every precautIon.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.718
Was there something else?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.183
Well...

23:44.220 --> 23:46.040
Miss Watson first came
to my attentIon

23:46.090 --> 23:49.810
as America's foremost expert
on home security, so...

23:49.860 --> 23:52.055
perhaps she could take
a look around, hmm?

23:52.090 --> 23:54.729
See if everything's
up to snuff.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.819
I suppose so.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.418
Thank you.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.888
It's what I do.

24:01.940 --> 24:06.036
We've got motion detectors
at each end of the corridors,

24:06.070 --> 24:08.209
security nodes
on all the windows.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.206
Well, Miss Watson,
what do you think?

24:13.250 --> 24:15.138
It's secure.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.818
It's very secure.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.819
High praise indeed,
from the likes of her.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.978
Don't know what else
there Is to say.

24:23.020 --> 24:25.488
Again, shatterproof glass,

24:25.530 --> 24:27.179
security nodes on all
the windows.

24:27.230 --> 24:29.755
And what is the
floodlight situation
on the windows?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.028
Fully covered, of course.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.025
(nail clinking,
rattling onto floor)

24:32.070 --> 24:33.196
Motion-sensitive.

24:33.230 --> 24:34.993
We replace the bulbs
the minute they go out.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.066
Excuse me. _
What are you domg?

24:38.110 --> 24:39.702
I'm so sorry.
So sorry.

24:39.740 --> 24:45.007
Ijust, uh...
I love folk art.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.200
Thank you very much.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.514
We'll be in touch
when we have Lestrade.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.142
Yes.

24:55.220 --> 24:59.088
You had to tell him
I was the number one
home securIty expert?

24:59.130 --> 25:00.552
You couldn't have
told him

25:00.600 --> 25:01.919
I was number eight
or something?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.257
You acquitted
yourself admirably.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.120
Anyway, it was
time well spent.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.592
You found something?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.188
Lestrade was right.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.639
Lawrence Pendry
did kill his wife.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.968
I know exactly
how he did it.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.239
HOLMES: 13 months ago,
a neighbor heard the shot

25:18.280 --> 25:20.840
which took Mary Pendry's life
at exactly 6:33.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.581
I just want to know what you
found in that bastard's house.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.315
The primary reason
you were never able

25:26.350 --> 25:28.181
to build a case against Pendry

25:28.220 --> 25:30.688
was that you could not find
the murder weapon.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.894
I humbly submit that it was
in the kitchen the entire time.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.625
No, you see, that's bollocks,

25:36.660 --> 25:38.059
'cause we turned the whole house
upSIde down.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.920
There was absolutely no gun.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.736
That's because you made the
mistake of looking for a gun.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.308
This is the weapon
that I believe

25:47.340 --> 25:49.604
Pendry used
to kill his wife.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.779
A plastic gun.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.175
You're absolutely right.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.347
Yes, I did see one
of those, actually.

25:54.380 --> 25:55.847
It was in the cutlery drawer.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.711
Thought it was a toy,
so I left it alone.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.286
You think I'm daft?

25:59.320 --> 26:02.357
What, you think I wouldn't
recognize a plastic gun?

26:02.390 --> 26:04.779
We don't think
it looked like that

26:04.830 --> 26:08.596
by the time you got there;
we think it looked like this.

26:08.630 --> 26:10.257
HOLMES: I don't believe
that it was milk

26:10.300 --> 26:12.666
in that bottle;
I believe it was acetone.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.691
Acetone?

26:14.740 --> 26:17.095
He used acetone
to melt the gun.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.267
The crime, as I see it,

26:19.310 --> 26:21.972
Pendry shoots his wife
at 6:33.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.001
He the disassembles his weapon
and he drops the pieces

26:24.050 --> 26:26.678
into a bottle
he's filled with acetone.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.770
He then dials 999 at 6:36

26:29.820 --> 26:32.186
to report that his wife has
been murdered by an intruder.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.209
The acetone, meanwhile,
is dissolving

26:33.250 --> 26:34.979
the gun he used to murder her,

26:35.020 --> 26:37.318
leaving nothing but a milk-like
liquid in the bottle

26:37.360 --> 26:39.681
in his refrigerator.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.357
It's unbelievable.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.029
And all of this from
a photograph of a pint of milk?

26:45.070 --> 26:46.662
And a nail.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.337
It's illegal for a gun company

26:49.370 --> 26:51.736
to make or manufacture
a plastIc weapon.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.362
But with advances
In 3-D prIntIng,

26:53.410 --> 26:55.674
it makes it possible
for anyone with the right specs

26:55.710 --> 26:57.871
to build one in the comfort
of their own home.

26:57.910 --> 27:00.674
They only need one piece
of metal to make it work:

27:00.720 --> 27:03.689
a nail to act as the firing pin.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.813
Now, Pendry couldn't very well
melt a nail, could he?

27:05.850 --> 27:07.659
So he hid it in plain sight.

27:07.690 --> 27:09.385
He used it to re-hang
one of the masks

27:09.420 --> 27:10.921
in the living room
before the police arrived.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.689
That's why it was hanging

27:12.730 --> 27:14.891
lower than the others--
He did the work in a hurry.

27:14.930 --> 27:17.398
When I examined that nail today,

27:17.430 --> 27:20.319
I noticed that the tip
was slightly charred.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.338
Carbon scoring

27:22.370 --> 27:24.634
from where
it struck the bullet.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.430
I was right.

27:27.470 --> 27:30.109
I always knew it, you see?
I always knew.

27:30.140 --> 27:32.347
Ijust didn't... I...

27:32.380 --> 27:35.110
I need to take
this case to Hopkins.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.277
And I don't care
if he... he bangs me up

27:37.320 --> 27:39.686
for what I did at the funeral.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.449
I just want to see
that bastard rot!

27:41.490 --> 27:44.687
All we have is a nail
with a blackened tip.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.755
Any number of reasons
that could have happened.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.725
The gunshot residue would have
worn off ages ago.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.797
We have no way to prove that
it was ever part of a weapon.

27:52.830 --> 27:56.095
If we are to undo him,

27:56.140 --> 27:59.268
we need to find out more
about how and where

27:59.310 --> 28:01.130
he made that gun.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.740
London, like New York,
is a beacon of freedom

28:05.780 --> 28:07.475
and a target
for terrorists.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.239
It is, as a consequence,

28:09.280 --> 28:12.010
one of the most observed
cities in the world.

28:12.050 --> 28:16.089
Its network of thousands
upon thousands of CCTV cameras

28:16.120 --> 28:17.951
track the movements
of its citizens,

28:17.990 --> 28:20.356
looking for anything
at all out of place.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.358
Yeah, I noticed.
They're kind of everywhere.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.265
Mm. Now I know for a fact

28:24.300 --> 28:25.927
that some of England's
network of watchmen

28:25.970 --> 28:27.426
verge on the competent.

28:27.470 --> 28:29.938
I would wager that,
like us, they're aware

28:29.970 --> 28:32.734
of the new and deadly
advances in 3-D printing.

28:32.770 --> 28:35.409
I would also wager
that the nation's gun-averse

28:35.440 --> 28:36.873
and ever-more-paranoid
security apparatus

28:36.910 --> 28:41.370
are tracking the sales
of 3-D printers.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.819
Would you mind?

28:42.850 --> 28:44.784
If they are,
it should be a simple matter

28:44.820 --> 28:46.117
of consulting
their database,

28:46.150 --> 28:48.311
see if we can
connect one to Pendry.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.250
since they became GPS—capable.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.450
He doesn't like the idea that
one could be used to track him.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.388
Now what?

28:58.430 --> 29:00.489
Now we wait.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.818
We've been here
for over four hours.

29:13.850 --> 29:16.774
Are you sure you're
just not using this as an excuse

29:16.820 --> 29:18.481
so I don't have dinner
with your brother?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.385
I've decided I don't have
a problem with it.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.512
What, dinner?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.016
The retaliatory sex.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.857
You're an adult.
You can do as you please.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.528
Might even be good for you;
clear your mind.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.050
You know what?
For the last time,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.523
no one is having sex
with anyone, okay?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.028
He wants to get to know me
because I am your partner.

29:33.070 --> 29:35.436
I want to get to know him
because he is your brother.

29:35.470 --> 29:37.233
You hope to learn secrets
from my childhood.

29:37.270 --> 29:38.806
Mycroft will be of little use.

29:38.840 --> 29:39.932
We went to separate
boarding schools.

29:39.970 --> 29:42.404
Oh! Hey, cheers!

29:42.440 --> 29:43.873
Congratulations, Watson.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.777
You just met Langdale Pike.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.559
WATSON: Wow, looks like the 3-D
printing business has been good.

29:54.590 --> 29:56.387
Mm.
I shall let you know

29:56.420 --> 29:57.580
if Lestrade
and I find anything.

29:57.620 --> 29:58.882
What... what,
you're ditching me?

29:58.930 --> 30:00.852
I'm conducting
an experiment.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.856
I'm curious to know
which of us is right
about my brother.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.889
My money's on me.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.591
Bon appetit.

30:05.630 --> 30:08.531
WATSON:
Hello?

30:08.570 --> 30:11.061
MYCROFT:
Joan!

30:11.110 --> 30:12.566
Right on time.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.874
I was, uh, digging around
in the cellar.

30:14.910 --> 30:16.878
Wasn't sure whether you liked
red or white,

30:16.910 --> 30:18.605
so I excavated a bottle of both.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.370
Um, is the restaurant
closed tonight?

30:22.420 --> 30:24.888
My prettiest eatery by far,
but the acoustics are rubbish.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.957
This way we'll have
a decent conversation.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.857
You know there's nothing
happening here, right?

30:33.960 --> 30:36.895
You thought this was
a romantic engagement?

30:36.930 --> 30:39.592
It's not?

30:39.630 --> 30:41.598
Please sit down.

30:47.270 --> 30:48.931
There's something
I wanted

30:48.980 --> 30:50.629
to discuss with you
in private.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.274
I thought it was
a conversation best lubricated

30:53.310 --> 30:55.141
with good food
and good wine.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.580
(clears throat)

31:01.620 --> 31:05.420
I, um...

31:05.460 --> 31:08.156
lied to Sherlock yesterday
when I told him

31:08.200 --> 31:09.394
I'd lost weight via exercise.

31:09.430 --> 31:10.897
The truth is...

31:10.930 --> 31:11.919
You were sick.

31:15.570 --> 31:18.061
I noticed the scars _
on your erst thIs mornIng.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.668
Graft-versus-host?

31:19.710 --> 31:23.942
You had a bone
marrow transplant

31:23.980 --> 31:26.676
some time in the last...
two years?

31:26.710 --> 31:28.644
If I didn't know you were
an ex-surgeon,

31:28.680 --> 31:31.217
I'd say you've been spending
too much time with my brother.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.512
(chuckles)

31:32.550 --> 31:33.687
That's actually
what I wanted

31:33.720 --> 31:36.917
to discuss with you
this evening;

31:36.960 --> 31:38.951
time with my brother.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.220
You're right, of course,
about everything.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.693
I was sick, very sick.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.288
When I wasn't vomiting,

31:46.330 --> 31:48.093
I found myself prone
to reflection.

31:48.140 --> 31:52.406
It dawned on me the one regret
I have in life was

31:52.440 --> 31:55.307
the state of my relationship
with Sherlock.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.047
I hadn't asked him
to see if he'd be a match.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.446
You see, I hadn't even told him
I was ill.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.985
And as my condition
improved, I decided

32:05.020 --> 32:06.681
I'd figure out an approach;

32:06.720 --> 32:08.517
some way to make things better.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.484
But then, of course, he showed
up on my doorstep yesterday,

32:11.530 --> 32:12.679
and Ijust...

32:12.730 --> 32:16.052
fell into old habits.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.662
You're obviously
Sherlock's friend.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.669
As I mentioned, Sherlock's never
had any friends.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.659
Many colleagues,
never a friend... until you.

32:27.710 --> 32:31.703
I want to know
how you did it.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.015
I want to know...

32:35.050 --> 32:38.941
how does one become
Sherlock Holmes' friend?

32:42.720 --> 32:46.349
HOLMES: Look, (clears throat)
I owe you an apology...

32:46.390 --> 32:49.951
for not protecting you
when we worked together.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.428
Protecting me from what?

32:54.470 --> 32:57.496
From the spotlight,
the attention.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.064
(chuckles)
Those were some

32:59.110 --> 33:01.408
of the best days
of my career.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.579
You know, my name
was in the paper,

33:03.610 --> 33:05.703
my face was on the telly.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.149
The whole thing,
it was, it was...

33:07.180 --> 33:08.670
It was intoxicating, hm?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.278
Yeah, well, I was gonna say
it was everything

33:10.320 --> 33:11.742
I dreamed about being
a policeman,

33:11.790 --> 33:14.111
but that as well, yeah.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.583
I'm glad we helped
so many people.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.587
Well, I helped them.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.621
You only said you did.

33:18.660 --> 33:19.752
Well, I...

33:19.790 --> 33:22.429
No...

33:22.460 --> 33:23.757
my carelessness had
a negative impact,

33:23.800 --> 33:25.620
and, um...

33:25.670 --> 33:30.596
I'd like to, uh,
I'd like to make amends.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.201
So, um... Ijust,
I-I-I wrote some...

33:34.240 --> 33:35.707
(clears throat)

33:35.740 --> 33:36.707
I wrote some things...

33:36.740 --> 33:38.105
Hello.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.277
...down.
It says here that...

33:40.310 --> 33:42.312
Pendry had this handyman,
this guy called Nick Ginn.

33:42.350 --> 33:43.544
and he was _
a small-tIme VIIIaIn,

33:43.580 --> 33:45.081
and we had him in
for questioning.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.712
But he had an alibi
the night of the murder.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.115
All right, now it says

33:48.160 --> 33:50.048
that he bought a 3D printer

33:50.090 --> 33:52.251
one week before
Mary Pendry died.

33:53.860 --> 33:57.227
Pendry paid him
to buy the printer.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.591
And then he built the gun.

33:59.530 --> 34:00.827
Hm.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.690
Now if Ginn still
has the printer,

34:02.740 --> 34:05.459
or if we can compel him
to confirm our hypothesis,

34:05.510 --> 34:07.637
We can prove...

34:07.670 --> 34:09.228
that I was right.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.304
(knocking on door)

34:11.480 --> 34:13.471
Open up, Nicky!

34:20.190 --> 34:21.452
I sorted it,
you know.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.378
Sorted what?

34:23.420 --> 34:26.287
A way you can make amends.

34:26.330 --> 34:29.094
Let me take the
credit for this one,

34:29.130 --> 34:31.462
and we'll be square.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.139
Come on, I deserve it.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.168
Pendry's mine.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.187
HOLMES:
Nicholas Ginn.

35:00.230 --> 35:01.629
I obviously riled Pendry

35:01.660 --> 35:03.355
when I examined
the charred nail today.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.288
He decided
to tie up loose ends

35:05.330 --> 35:07.764
by murdering his accomplice.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.836
He cleaned_the scene
qUIte metIculously.

35:09.870 --> 35:11.667
Yeah, I passed DCI
Hopkins on the way in.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.836
He didn't seem very happy.

35:12.870 --> 35:15.270
He knows I've been
helping Lestrade.

35:15.310 --> 35:16.777
He wants me to give up
his location,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.300
but I would prefer not to

35:18.350 --> 35:20.341
_ until his case
agaInst Pendry has been made.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.678
And yet...

35:22.720 --> 35:25.382
I don't suppose you found
a 3D printer in here?

35:25.420 --> 35:27.285
Pendry obviously
destroyed that ages ago.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.151
Why obviously?

35:29.190 --> 35:30.452
Ginn is six-foot-four.

35:30.490 --> 35:32.481
He has at least
two stone on Pendry.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.827
If he still had access
to the printer,

35:33.860 --> 35:35.225
don't you think
he would've built himself

35:35.260 --> 35:37.490
another gun to kill Ginn, hmm?

35:37.530 --> 35:39.669
It would've been
the safer way to go by far.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.635
There's just so little here
that makes sense.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.365
I know.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.799
He used one of the victim's
own knives to kill him.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.535
You think a planner like Pendry

35:48.580 --> 35:49.831
would've brought
a weapon of his own.

35:49.880 --> 35:53.543
Also the sta_b wound
was obVIously

35:53.580 --> 35:55.343
the result
of a left-handed blow.

35:55.380 --> 35:56.642
But Pendry is right-handed,

35:56.680 --> 35:58.887
so why would he use
his non-dominant hand

35:58.920 --> 36:01.184
to stab someone to death?

36:01.220 --> 36:02.858
You knew Pendry was
a righty, right?

36:02.890 --> 36:05.358
Yeah, of course.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.689
What are you doing?

36:25.980 --> 36:28.813
*

36:40.030 --> 36:41.918
Well, I was wrong, Watson.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.793
Pendry does still have
a printer.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.492
And he used it
to build another gun.

36:47.530 --> 36:48.531
(knocking on door)

36:50.400 --> 36:51.537
Good evening.

36:51.570 --> 36:52.639
I have a confession to make.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.705
Miss Watson is not, in fact,

36:53.740 --> 36:55.970
a home security specialist.

36:56.010 --> 36:57.807
Dan, pick up the phone
for God's sake.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.638
I've got police in my house
and I need my solicitor.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.317
If that's
what you're here for,

37:04.350 --> 37:05.908
then just take it and leave.

37:05.950 --> 37:08.282
This? No, no, you've changed
this since yesterday.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.778
Aanay, we're not here regarding
the murder of your wife Mary.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.889
We're here about the death
of Nicholas Ginn.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.750
VVho?
WATSON: Your
ex-handyman.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.392
The one who bought the
printer that made the gun

37:17.430 --> 37:18.863
you used to kill Mary.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.993
After I looked at that nail,
you panicked.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.566
You went to wherever
you're hIdIng the prInter,

37:22.600 --> 37:24.602
and you built yourself
another gun.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.732
You went to kill Ginn.

37:25.770 --> 37:26.907
But when you fired,

37:26.940 --> 37:28.373
the gun exploded in your hand.

37:28.410 --> 37:29.877
When you killed Mary,

37:29.910 --> 37:32.276
you used a special-order
.22-caliber round.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.948
Today, you were in a hurry.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.277
You used a .22 long.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.969
Mm. Higher velocity
bullet can cause

37:37.020 --> 37:38.885
the plastic pistol
to explode.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.740
Ginn lunged at you.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.758
You grabbed a knife
with your uninjured left hand

37:42.790 --> 37:43.814
The heavier man

37:43.860 --> 37:45.725
threw himself onto the blade.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.489
You did a decent job
of cleaning the scene.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.623
You found every piece
of the gun.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.766
Except for the pieces
that landed in Ginn's fruit.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.791
WATSON: Now, if you
fired the weapon,

37:54.840 --> 37:57.035
you'd have wounds on
your right forearm.

37:57.070 --> 37:58.662
We just need to
take a look.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.065
Mm. Which, as it happens,
is exactly

38:01.110 --> 38:03.431
what his warrant
empowers mm to do.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.040
(phone ringing)
HOLMES: It's going to be
your solicitor.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.947
You can just tell him
you're heading into custody.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.912
(siren warbling)

38:21.730 --> 38:23.994
Thank you.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.668
Well, lads,
you can take me to nick.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.725
Detective?

38:27.770 --> 38:29.692
I thank you not to take credit

38:29.740 --> 38:32.061
for any of my insights
into the case.

38:32.110 --> 38:35.079
Right, so your whole
making it up to me

38:35.110 --> 38:36.873
was just a complete
and utter lie.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.036
Was it?

38:38.080 --> 38:40.708
I will not enable you anymore.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.742
I am withdrawing
your drug of choice.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.680
Right.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.109
It's back to obscurity
for me then.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.811
Don't be a stranger.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.091
LESTRADE (on TV):
Of course, I stay current

38:58.130 --> 39:01.395
to the capabilities
of the 3D printers.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.364
I always knew
that Lawrence Pendry

39:04.410 --> 39:07.106
was, in fact, guilty and had
actually murdered his wife.

39:07.140 --> 39:10.371
I just needed to figure out
how and... and why.

39:10.410 --> 39:12.776
He called your bluff.

39:12.810 --> 39:16.610
He knows you'll never step
forward to take the credit.

39:16.650 --> 39:19.847
Curious.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.711
I never felt this particular
cocktail of emotions.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.627
Anger, exasperation...

39:25.660 --> 39:28.629
and a hint of...

39:28.660 --> 39:30.821
Worry?

39:30.860 --> 39:32.999
Yeah, well, welcome
to caring about an addict.

39:33.030 --> 39:35.032
(phone dings)

39:35.070 --> 39:36.697
WEATHERMAN: With seasonal
temperatures, we should reach

39:36.740 --> 39:38.560
our normal high
of about 82 degrees

39:38.610 --> 39:39.668
by this afternoon.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.735
Clear skies tonight...

39:49.750 --> 39:51.172
All right, Fatty,
let's make this quick.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.984
Watson and I have
a plane to catch.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.487
You said it was urgent.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.885
Take a seat, would you?

39:56.920 --> 39:59.150
Only take a moment.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.597
I lied to you the other day,

40:06.630 --> 40:09.565
when I said I'd given
all your stuff to charity.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.739
It's in storage.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.431
Over there, behind that door.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.677
I bet you expect me
to thank you, don't you?

40:21.720 --> 40:24.211
Well, you're lucky I didn't
turn it all in to the police.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.945
Your collection included,
amongst other things,

40:25.990 --> 40:27.082
a real shrunken head,

40:27.120 --> 40:29.953
what appeared to be
an authentic Picasso

40:29.990 --> 40:34.598
and an entire series of books
on homemade bomb building.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.222
(wry laugh)

40:36.260 --> 40:38.125
It's remarkable.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.095
You're too lazy to even
maintain a proper ruse.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.098
We're not gonna
fight, Sherlock.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.768
No matter how much
you want to.

40:50.110 --> 40:52.101
Something's wrong.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.744
You're too calm.

40:54.780 --> 40:57.613
The other night at dinner,

40:57.650 --> 40:59.618
I sought a little
advice from Joan

40:59.650 --> 41:02.118
about _how best to
communIcate WIth you.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.924
And why on earth
would you want to do that?

41:04.960 --> 41:08.726
She said that when one has
something to tell you,

41:08.760 --> 41:12.059
one must make
really, really sure

41:12.100 --> 41:14.989
that you're listening.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.714
Books on bomb building.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.859
I consider us even now.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.584
Which means I can tell you
I forgive you.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.029
For everything.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.228
Have a safe trip
back to the colonies.

41:48.270 --> 41:51.603
And know that things are
different between us now.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.063
*

42:04.280 --> 42:07.841
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

42:07.890 --> 42:10.017
You okay?

42:10.060 --> 42:12.324
I believe I've just
made a rapprochement

42:12.360 --> 42:14.021
with my brother.

42:14.060 --> 42:15.789
Oh, that's great.

42:15.830 --> 42:17.923
He used a homemade
exploswe deVIce

42:17.960 --> 42:19.894
to destroy what was
left of my things.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.300
Ah.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.264
Sounds like maybe he's a little
more like you than you thought.

42:27.310 --> 42:30.131
Art in the blood, Watson.

42:30.180 --> 42:32.171
It takes the strangest forms.
