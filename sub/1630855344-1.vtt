05:26.291 --> 05:27.990
So, wouldn't you know it?

05:27.990 --> 05:29.550
Right after I buy the house,

05:29.550 --> 05:32.970
a pipe burst and the whole house floods

05:32.970 --> 05:34.407
so I had to remove all
the furniture in here

05:34.407 --> 05:35.740
and all the carpeting

05:38.460 --> 05:39.780
It's been a nightmare.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.100
Still got a long way to go,

05:41.100 --> 05:43.500
but I've been down here
for about two weeks

05:43.500 --> 05:46.680
doing some repairs to the
place that need to be done.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.100
As far as updates go, no
real updates with this house.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.150
I've been down here two weeks.

05:51.150 --> 05:55.091
Haven't heard any knocking,
haven't heard any phone calls.

05:55.091 --> 05:56.536
Oh, the only thing though,

05:56.536 --> 06:00.900
I bring my keyboard down and
I can still sometimes see

06:00.900 --> 06:03.600
who I think is my wife in
the reflection of the door,

06:03.600 --> 06:07.050
which is really cool,
but it's more seldom.

06:07.050 --> 06:08.700
And when I leave here,

06:08.700 --> 06:11.760
I actually will take this
keyboard home and put it upstairs

06:11.760 --> 06:15.270
and I can still sometimes hear
the notes playing themselves.

06:15.270 --> 06:18.813
But again, not anything like it used to.

06:19.830 --> 06:22.770
Just talking about it,
it's making me upset.

06:22.770 --> 06:24.030
Honestly, that's it for updates.

06:24.030 --> 06:26.190
I don't really know why
I'm even filming right now,

06:26.190 --> 06:29.800
other than the fact that
I'm extremely lonely

06:32.100 --> 06:34.803
and I miss my children.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.530
That sounded really,
really Pathetic and sad.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.080
I almost started crying myself.

06:50.190 --> 06:51.153
I gotta go home.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.170
I gotta get outta here.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.610
I miss my kids and just
talking about 'em...

06:56.610 --> 06:58.173
All right, cut the cameras.

07:05.610 --> 07:07.950
So I left a house 10 minutes ago

07:07.950 --> 07:08.853
and my phone just let me know

07:08.853 --> 07:10.680
that I got a text from Officer Ramey.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.230
He tried to call, but I don't
have any service out here.

07:13.230 --> 07:16.890
And his text says, "Call me, urgent."

07:16.890 --> 07:18.600
That's all it says.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.520
I've never heard that
guy use the word urgent,

07:20.520 --> 07:24.423
so I'm definitely curious
as to what is going on.

07:25.563 --> 07:26.490
Yeah?

07:26.490 --> 07:27.323
Hey, it's me.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.312
What's up?

07:28.312 --> 07:30.547
Are you still in Florida?

07:30.547 --> 07:32.943
Yeah, but I just left not long ago.

07:34.512 --> 07:36.540
- How long have
you been on the road?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.160
I've been on the road for about an hour.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.210
Why, what's going on?

07:40.212 --> 07:42.531
- I'm gonna need
you to turn your car around

07:42.531 --> 07:45.198
and come to my office right now.

07:47.270 --> 07:48.631
Okay, why?

07:48.631 --> 07:50.272
Is everything okay?

07:50.272 --> 07:52.811
- Uh, no, we've
got a situation here.

07:52.811 --> 07:54.827
We want to show you something.

07:54.827 --> 07:56.494
It's pretty serious.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.250
Okay, it's gonna be like two hours.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.413
Well, I'm not saying to hurry,

08:01.813 --> 08:03.215
but if someone pulls you over,

08:03.215 --> 08:07.350
just tell them your name
and they'll let you go.

08:07.350 --> 08:09.900
- Okay, I'll get down there
as quickly as possible.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.478
Can you tell me what this is about?

08:13.478 --> 08:15.722
I'll tell you when you get here.

08:15.722 --> 08:16.680
All right, I'll see you...

08:16.680 --> 08:18.517
I'll see you when I see you, bye.

08:18.517 --> 08:21.401
All right, bye.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.901
What the is this all about?

08:29.798 --> 08:30.882
I like those cameras.

08:30.882 --> 08:32.651
I know that model.

08:32.651 --> 08:33.567
You want me to move it?

08:33.567 --> 08:34.400
I'm not in frame.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.655
You want me to move it for you?

08:35.655 --> 08:37.072
All right, there.

08:37.928 --> 08:39.788
Ramey, am I in trouble?

08:39.788 --> 08:41.517
You've got me nervous.

08:41.517 --> 08:42.350
Uh, no.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.858
We're gonna explain
things here in a second.

08:43.858 --> 08:47.795
I just wanted to reintroduce
you to Detective Barnes.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.503
Hey man, it's good see you again.

08:50.503 --> 08:51.773
He's gonna be the one

08:51.773 --> 08:53.267
heading up this investigation

08:53.267 --> 08:56.011
also with Officer Santos from the FBI

08:56.011 --> 08:57.520
who you have not yet met.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.453
Uh, did I do something wrong?

08:59.453 --> 09:00.863
Is this about my investigating

09:00.863 --> 09:02.592
of trying to find those people?

09:02.592 --> 09:05.981
- No, this is
actually about something else.

09:05.981 --> 09:06.814
Okay.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.373
This note.

09:09.373 --> 09:11.300
Uh, this is actually a note that was left

09:11.300 --> 09:14.770
at a possible crime scene
of a local girl, age 27,

09:14.770 --> 09:16.708
who went missing two days ago.

09:16.708 --> 09:17.541
Okay.

09:17.541 --> 09:19.838
This was found in her bed

09:19.838 --> 09:21.976
where she was supposed
to be Sunday morning.

09:21.976 --> 09:22.809
Okay.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.481
I don't understand.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.412
- Well, could you
explain who this is a picture of

09:30.412 --> 09:32.724
on this piece of paper?

09:32.724 --> 09:35.709
That's a picture of Mrs. Blackwell.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.789
- Right, so what
we're trying to figure out

09:37.789 --> 09:40.340
is why someone would
intentionally leave this

09:40.340 --> 09:43.757
for us to find at a possible crime scene.

09:46.369 --> 09:47.786
I have no idea.

09:48.651 --> 09:52.454
- It kind of involves
you, wouldn't you say?

09:52.454 --> 09:55.208
- I mean, it's definitely
weird that somebody

09:55.208 --> 09:57.386
would print off a
picture of Mrs. Blackwell

09:57.386 --> 10:00.651
and leave it at a scene, but I don't...

10:00.651 --> 10:02.172
Yeah, it's weird.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.005
All right,

10:03.005 --> 10:04.874
well if you think of
anything else regarding this,

10:04.874 --> 10:07.593
please don't hesitate to
call me because you know,

10:07.593 --> 10:10.005
we think whoever did leave
this did so on purpose.

10:10.005 --> 10:10.838
Okay.

10:10.838 --> 10:12.134
As some type of message.

10:12.134 --> 10:14.331
And we figured since you were
already down here in Florida,

10:14.331 --> 10:17.223
you might as well come in and
check it out for yourself.

10:17.223 --> 10:18.549
So that's where we're at.

10:18.549 --> 10:20.263
No, yeah, I mean...

10:20.263 --> 10:21.373
I'll do what I can.

10:21.373 --> 10:22.788
I don't know how much I'll be able to do,

10:22.788 --> 10:25.050
but I'll do what I can for sure.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.517
Definitely serious, right?

10:40.410 --> 10:44.720
The envelope it was in was
postmarked February 14th, 2021,

10:44.720 --> 10:46.320
so I've had this thing
for over a year now.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.450
- And you're
telling me it's the same one

10:48.450 --> 10:49.500
that we showed you?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.390
- Man, it's exactly the same
as the one you showed me.

10:51.390 --> 10:52.924
I'm looking at it right now.

10:52.924 --> 10:55.741
- Are you by chance
touching this with your hands?

10:55.741 --> 10:56.574
Yes.

10:56.574 --> 10:57.989
All right, stop doing that.

10:57.989 --> 11:00.630
Now, you said you had the
original envelope it came in?

11:00.630 --> 11:02.220
- Yeah, according to
the post office stamp,

11:02.220 --> 11:05.070
it was mailed from a town called
Reddick in Central Florida.

11:05.070 --> 11:07.170
And where there's supposed
to be a return address,

11:07.170 --> 11:08.523
it just has question marks.

11:09.861 --> 11:11.197
- All right, don't
touch it with your hands.

11:11.197 --> 11:13.241
Put it in a bag and send it to my office

11:13.241 --> 11:14.793
so I can run it for prints, okay?

11:14.793 --> 11:17.630
Can you tell me what this means for me?

11:17.630 --> 11:21.094
- I really wish
I could man, but I can't.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.677
I have no idea what's going on.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.060
- So I figured I'd take a
second to explain things

11:30.060 --> 11:32.550
because maybe things aren't
clear up to this point,

11:32.550 --> 11:34.290
so I'll just try to clarify.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.520
So long story short,

11:35.520 --> 11:38.730
a girl went missing in
Florida less than a week ago

11:38.730 --> 11:41.280
and they found this riddle slash puzzle,

11:41.280 --> 11:42.360
I don't know what it is,

11:42.360 --> 11:44.670
in her bed where she was supposed to be.

11:44.670 --> 11:48.270
A year ago, I got in my personal mail

11:48.270 --> 11:52.226
the exact same riddle or
whatever it is at my house.

11:52.226 --> 11:54.750
And so I'm taking it to
the post office right now

11:54.750 --> 11:57.570
to mail it down to the Florida, whatever.

11:57.570 --> 12:00.420
But you know, I'm creeped out right now

12:00.420 --> 12:03.000
because at the root of this,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.970
there really is a missing
girl in Florida right now.

12:05.970 --> 12:10.970
And if the person who took
that girl said this to me

12:13.080 --> 12:18.080
as a threat, it's not to be taken lightly.

12:18.621 --> 12:23.621
I think the biggest question
I have right now is, why me?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.700
You know, maybe this guy's
just a fan of my movies.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.533
I don't know.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.366
But then again,

12:28.366 --> 12:29.850
maybe I'm just overanalyzing
this whole thing

12:29.850 --> 12:32.880
and I'm not really involved
as much as I think I am.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.430
It's very possible that moving forward,

12:35.430 --> 12:36.360
I never see anything

12:36.360 --> 12:39.723
that connects me to this case ever again.

12:42.786 --> 12:43.619
I sure hope so.

12:56.205 --> 12:57.038
Hello?

12:57.038 --> 12:57.871
Hey, it's me.

12:57.871 --> 12:59.903
Hey, what's up?

12:59.903 --> 13:01.140
So I don't know how to say this,

13:01.140 --> 13:04.440
but I just got another
package from your guy,

13:04.440 --> 13:05.689
if he is a guy.

13:05.689 --> 13:08.280
- How do you know
it's the same person?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.933
Trust me, it's from your guy.

13:11.595 --> 13:15.390
So there is a piece of
cloth wrapped in plastic

13:15.390 --> 13:18.840
and it's covered in what
appears to be blood,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.280
which is maybe the most disturbing thing

13:20.280 --> 13:23.433
I've ever seen in my house, maybe my life.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.490
And another ransom looking note.

13:26.490 --> 13:29.330
Uh, what's it say?

13:29.330 --> 13:32.368
It says, "A gift for my new friend."

13:32.368 --> 13:33.713
Jesus Christ...

13:33.713 --> 13:36.977
- Should I call my
local police about this?

13:36.977 --> 13:38.217
'Cause this is pretty serious.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.466
- No, don't do
that, I'll call them.

13:39.466 --> 13:40.302
I'll take care of that.

13:40.302 --> 13:42.046
I'll have an officer
sent over to your house

13:42.046 --> 13:43.617
to look at it or pick it up.

13:43.617 --> 13:44.956
Uh, don't touch it.

13:44.956 --> 13:46.690
But you know, friend to friend,

13:46.690 --> 13:49.680
I gotta ask you a serious question.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.039
What?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.622
Do you own a firearm?

13:54.660 --> 13:55.493
Are you serious?

13:55.493 --> 13:56.700
That's the question you're asking me?

13:56.700 --> 13:57.976
I'm dead serious.

13:57.976 --> 13:59.226
Do you own one?

14:00.450 --> 14:01.623
Yes, I own a gun.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.470
- All right, when was
the last time you fired a gun?

14:04.470 --> 14:06.783
Uh, when I was eight.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.263
Is your sister at school?

14:17.254 --> 14:18.750
Ya.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.401
You're sick today, you're not at school.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.590
You should be at school, buddy.

14:22.590 --> 14:25.080
You're making dad's work extra hard.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.270
So it's been roughly a 10
days since I got that thing

14:27.270 --> 14:30.690
in the mail, and shortly after
talking to Officer Ramey,

14:30.690 --> 14:32.550
he had a local policeman
come over and pick it up.

14:32.550 --> 14:35.220
So it's gone, but the damage had been done

14:35.220 --> 14:38.490
because it's all I think
about every few minutes.

14:38.490 --> 14:40.890
And I shouldn't be.

14:40.890 --> 14:43.470
I don't think I've ever been
this traumatized in my life

14:43.470 --> 14:44.770
and I've seen some .

14:45.870 --> 14:48.270
But moving on, come here, come here.

14:48.270 --> 14:51.930
Tomorrow's a very special day
because it marks the first day

14:51.930 --> 14:53.913
I met this little guy's mommy,

14:54.780 --> 14:57.000
and so we're gonna go to the
playground and have a good time

14:57.000 --> 14:59.886
and try not to think about it.

14:59.886 --> 15:01.378
Isn't that right?

16:17.610 --> 16:18.443
Hey, it's me.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.210
So I just got a strange looking email

16:21.210 --> 16:22.260
and I think it's from the guy.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.767
All right, what's it say?

16:25.140 --> 16:26.280
I'm walking to my car right now.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.976
Can I call you back in 20 seconds?

16:27.976 --> 16:28.809
Sure.

16:28.809 --> 16:30.930
All right, bye.

16:30.930 --> 16:34.680
So the email says, "From
your secret admirer,

16:34.680 --> 16:36.240
I really admire your work.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.040
I hope that you admire mine.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.980
Link to a private chat
room will be live at nine."

16:40.980 --> 16:43.443
And then there's a link
to a private chat room.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.530
Man, I'm kind of freaking out here.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.669
I need you to tell me what to do.

16:48.669 --> 16:51.330
- How do you think
get got your email address?

16:51.330 --> 16:52.713
I have no idea.

16:53.578 --> 16:55.328
Okay, well, let me call Santos

16:55.328 --> 16:56.819
and I'll call you right back, okay?

16:56.819 --> 16:59.084
Forward me that email right now.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.410
All right, okay.

17:01.410 --> 17:02.243
Bye.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.100
Man, I don't want to do this anymore.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.186
I'm getting really nervous.

17:07.186 --> 17:10.923
I'm reaching my boiling point here.

17:12.495 --> 17:13.740
Man, I'm getting upset.

17:16.645 --> 17:17.610
Hey, I'm here.

17:17.610 --> 17:18.443
Can you hear me?

17:18.443 --> 17:20.870
- Yeah, so I got
Santos conferencing in.

17:21.704 --> 17:22.537
Okay.

17:22.537 --> 17:24.711
So what'd you guys come up with?

17:24.711 --> 17:25.544
What do I do?

17:26.892 --> 17:28.680
- Well, after talking
about it for a little bit,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.838
we think it's in everyone's best interest

17:30.838 --> 17:32.058
if you do the chat.

17:32.058 --> 17:35.340
- Okay, I'm getting
mad, I'm getting upset.

17:35.340 --> 17:39.015
Ramey, can I be candid
with you for a second?

17:39.015 --> 17:42.870
And don't judge me on this,
but what the man.

17:42.870 --> 17:46.611
I mean, I consider myself a
nice guy, sometimes too nice.

17:46.611 --> 17:48.780
And when I get the sense
that someone's mistaken

17:48.780 --> 17:51.360
my kindness for weakness, I
blow the up, all right?

17:51.360 --> 17:54.120
And I get the sense that that's
what's going on right now.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.213
You guys are using me.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.963
First off, please calm down.

17:56.963 --> 17:58.227
We understand there is a limit

17:58.227 --> 18:00.870
to your contributions as
a private citizen, okay?

18:00.870 --> 18:02.893
Now, we can't tell you
what to do, but listen.

18:02.893 --> 18:04.667
As your friend, I'm telling you

18:04.667 --> 18:06.600
I would never use you like that.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.740
We are only asking that you continue

18:08.740 --> 18:11.209
because you are so
unique to this situation.

18:11.209 --> 18:14.560
We have a deranged man who
has abducted a young girl

18:14.560 --> 18:17.743
and for some reason, he
only wants to talk to you.

18:17.743 --> 18:20.811
Okay, I've never seen this
happen in my entire career.

18:20.811 --> 18:23.310
And if you start to refuse or quit,

18:23.310 --> 18:25.506
you're either gonna piss him off more

18:25.506 --> 18:29.945
or you could get this girl
killed if she isn't already.

18:29.945 --> 18:31.667
So how would that make you feel

18:31.667 --> 18:33.595
to think you had the
opportunity to save someone,

18:33.595 --> 18:35.012
but chose not to?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.480
Hey mom.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.630
I don't want to scare you,
but something's going on.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.120
And I was wondering if
you could take the kids

18:54.120 --> 18:55.293
for a couple days.

18:56.610 --> 18:59.763
I don't want to tell you right
now, but it's pretty serious.

19:00.690 --> 19:01.743
All right, thank you.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.013
I love you too.

19:05.100 --> 19:05.933
Bye.

19:17.827 --> 19:19.860
So it's just past eight o'clock

19:19.860 --> 19:21.150
and I decided to turn the cameras on

19:21.150 --> 19:25.230
just to give a little update
because I'm all alone again.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.660
My kids are at my mom's house
and I'm just sitting here

19:27.660 --> 19:30.780
looking at the clock go by,
waiting for this chat to start.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.130
And it's just now starting to sink in

19:32.130 --> 19:33.303
what's about to happen.

19:35.610 --> 19:38.070
I'm about to have a conversation
with a complete psychopath

19:38.070 --> 19:41.760
who's abducted a girl, sent
me a bloody piece of clothing,

19:41.760 --> 19:44.700
and continues to harass
me on a daily basis.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.790
So yeah, trying to relax a
little bit, not going so hot.

19:47.790 --> 19:51.660
But a couple more of these,
I'll be raring to go I think.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.100
You might be asking,

19:53.100 --> 19:56.460
a great question is why am I doing this?

19:56.460 --> 20:00.723
And one word comes into
mind, and it's not hero.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.290
It's obligation.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.150
And I know that sounds terrible.

20:06.150 --> 20:08.640
And if the family is
watching this, I'm so sorry.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.493
I'm trying to do
everything I can, but man,

20:14.787 --> 20:17.250
that's gonna make me sound bad.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.650
Maybe I should cut that out.

20:20.908 --> 20:22.517
It's true though.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.910
So it says, "Waiting for
host to initiate chat."

20:32.910 --> 20:34.800
So I guess we're just waiting
for him to get on here.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.030
Can you both hear me?

20:36.030 --> 20:37.366
Yes.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.691
Are you guys recording this by chance?

20:39.691 --> 20:41.880
- Yeah.
- Okay good, me too.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.960
I've got like five or six
cameras going right now,

20:45.960 --> 20:47.883
so I hope I'm recording it.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.510
Wait a minute, it says host has joined

20:54.510 --> 20:58.263
so he's on here and he's typing.

21:03.723 --> 21:06.056
All right, he says, "Hello."

21:06.960 --> 21:09.361
Is it cool if I just
wing this and go with it?

21:09.361 --> 21:11.100
- Yeah, go for it.
- Okay, good.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.273
I'm just gonna reply.

21:20.610 --> 21:23.860
He says, "Have you figured it out yet?"

21:24.720 --> 21:25.743
Figured what out?

21:30.487 --> 21:31.320
"Who I am?"

21:34.543 --> 21:35.770
"Have we met before?"

21:39.470 --> 21:40.737
He says, "Not yet."

21:43.230 --> 21:44.760
You know, something just crossed my mind.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.593
This is kind of stupid.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.190
Is it possible this isn't even him?

21:47.190 --> 21:49.350
I mean, someone could have
just easily stumbled across

21:49.350 --> 21:50.852
this chat room, right?

21:50.852 --> 21:53.430
Should I make sure it's our guy?

21:53.430 --> 21:56.790
- Uh, that's
a great idea actually.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.767
"Just to make sure,

21:58.767 --> 22:01.497
what did you just send me in the mail?"

22:06.247 --> 22:07.530
"A piece of dirty cloth."

22:07.530 --> 22:09.153
Well, it's him.

22:10.141 --> 22:12.090
Ask him where the girl is.

22:12.090 --> 22:14.040
What's her name, the missing girl?

22:14.040 --> 22:14.933
It's Susan.

22:16.177 --> 22:17.937
"Where is Susan?"

22:22.020 --> 22:24.267
He says, "She is in a better place."

22:27.240 --> 22:29.579
Ask if she's alive.

22:29.579 --> 22:30.412
Okay.

22:31.887 --> 22:33.807
"Is she alive?"

22:38.220 --> 22:40.014
He says, "Not saying."

22:40.014 --> 22:43.038
Ask him about you.

22:43.038 --> 22:44.042
What?

22:44.042 --> 22:47.140
Ask him what he wants from you.

22:47.140 --> 22:49.167
"What do you want from me?"

22:56.174 --> 22:57.123
Wait a minute.

22:59.220 --> 23:02.939
Wait, he left.

23:02.939 --> 23:04.383
What do you mean?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.782
- I'm telling you, it says,
"Host has left the chat room."

23:07.782 --> 23:09.530
He's gone.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.292
What did you say to him?

23:11.292 --> 23:12.125
I don't know.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.160
I just asked what he wants from me

23:14.160 --> 23:16.560
and then he left the chat.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.810
What am I supposed to do?

23:20.220 --> 23:23.040
Wait a minute, he sent me something.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.137
He attached a file, it looks like.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.952
Let me see if I can't open it up, hold on.

23:40.890 --> 23:41.723
Oh my God.

23:45.705 --> 23:47.455
What is it?

23:49.290 --> 23:54.290
Um, it's a picture of me.

24:05.460 --> 24:08.730
So I'm on my way to Florida right now

24:08.730 --> 24:11.710
because the picture the guy sent me

24:12.621 --> 24:14.340
was actually taken a few months ago.

24:14.340 --> 24:16.110
And I know this because
I was down in Florida

24:16.110 --> 24:18.450
a few months ago working on the house.

24:18.450 --> 24:20.550
And every time I'm down
in Florida at the house,

24:20.550 --> 24:22.890
I take a few hours out of my
day to go out into the forest

24:22.890 --> 24:25.260
and follow the map and
see what I can find.

24:25.260 --> 24:26.880
I followed the map from the house.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.943
I followed the map from the water tower.

24:28.943 --> 24:31.650
Hell, the cops even ran
their own search for it.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.660
Nobody has ever found anything,

24:33.660 --> 24:36.150
except now this guy sends
me a picture of myself

24:36.150 --> 24:38.610
looking for it during
one of my last attempts.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.455
He says I should look harder next time.

24:40.455 --> 24:45.455
Nothing creepy about that,
but it tells me he's found it,

24:46.649 --> 24:48.873
which raises the biggest question yet.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.267
How, how does, this guy know
so much about this ?

24:55.530 --> 24:59.640
Somebody out there knows more
about this Lightfoot case

24:59.640 --> 25:02.430
than I do, and this is all I've been doing

25:02.430 --> 25:04.023
for the past like three years.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.628
And that pisses me off.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.590
So this is marker number two.

25:19.590 --> 25:22.770
I left this out here to act
as a visual representation

25:22.770 --> 25:25.770
of spot number two in case
I ever came back out here.

25:25.770 --> 25:27.000
According to the last clue,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.710
if I turn to a heading of 320,

25:28.710 --> 25:32.370
which is that way, and go 1100 heel toes,

25:32.370 --> 25:34.230
I should arrive to whatever this thing is.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.120
However, I've found in my past experiences

25:36.120 --> 25:39.450
that there's a difference
between a heading and a course.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.730
Especially given the terrain
and all the trees out there,

25:41.730 --> 25:45.690
it's almost impossible to
end up where you intend.

25:45.690 --> 25:47.190
And out of all the times I've done this,

25:47.190 --> 25:49.110
I never ended up the same place twice.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.030
So that's why I tied the ribbons to trees

25:51.030 --> 25:53.370
so I could tell where I had been before.

25:53.370 --> 25:56.793
So we'll do this again and we'll
hope for different results.

26:05.460 --> 26:08.550
So I just made it to 1100 heel toes

26:08.550 --> 26:12.273
and I'm looking around
and as every other time,

26:13.590 --> 26:14.883
I see absolutely nothing.

26:18.030 --> 26:19.950
So we'll do it again.

26:19.950 --> 26:21.540
So I just got back to marker number two.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.580
We're gonna try our second attempt.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.320
I don't know how many of these I got in me

26:25.320 --> 26:27.320
because the sun's going down and...

26:28.170 --> 26:31.170
But let's go, do it while we can, right?

26:31.170 --> 26:32.003
All right, here we go.

26:32.003 --> 26:34.543
We're gonna come up on
our final step here.

26:34.543 --> 26:36.900
I see a ribbon in a tree over there.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.060
So I've been here before,
but other than that,

26:39.060 --> 26:41.670
I'm looking around, I don't
see a God thing.

26:41.670 --> 26:42.510
So you know what that means?

26:42.510 --> 26:44.130
We start over and we do it again.

26:44.130 --> 26:46.860
All right, I'm on
attempt number four here.

26:46.860 --> 26:49.410
So some people might be
asking why I don't actually

26:49.410 --> 26:52.500
do heel toes like
instructed by the puzzle.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.900
And it's because I did the math,

26:54.900 --> 26:59.880
and 1100 heel toes is roughly
about 367 of my actual steps

27:00.870 --> 27:03.000
so it saves a lot of time

27:03.000 --> 27:05.750
and you don't look like an idiot
waddling across the forest.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.563
Not like anybody's out here to see-

27:32.310 --> 27:34.116
I just found something.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.743
So this is what got me.

27:56.610 --> 27:58.060
This is what took my picture.

28:01.140 --> 28:06.140
And it says, "You got
mail, 50 heel toes at 320,"

28:07.650 --> 28:11.723
which is that way, so
we're gonna go there.

28:41.430 --> 28:42.263
Found it.

28:43.620 --> 28:44.453
Found it.

29:57.590 --> 29:58.423
Hello?

29:58.423 --> 30:00.732
Hey, it's me, I think I found something.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.880
So I found the camera
that took my picture.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.970
It's some kind of do it
yourself trail camera.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.140
It's got an antenna on top.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.129
I think it's so he can
watch these videos remotely.

30:10.129 --> 30:10.962
Is that it?

30:10.962 --> 30:12.990
- No, and then I found
what he wanted me to find.

30:12.990 --> 30:15.490
It's a piece of paper in a glass bottle.

30:15.490 --> 30:17.383
What's on the piece of paper?

30:17.383 --> 30:19.483
I don't know, but I'm about to find out.

33:57.506 --> 33:59.006
Hello.

34:02.115 --> 34:03.532
I'm watching you.

35:16.350 --> 35:19.290
- So I'm back and we're
here to discuss this puzzle.

35:19.290 --> 35:21.270
Now that I've got it
scanned in high resolution,

35:21.270 --> 35:22.710
I can show it to y'all.

35:22.710 --> 35:24.405
There's really not much
to it, as you can see,

35:24.405 --> 35:27.150
so we'll just start over
here on the right side.

35:27.150 --> 35:29.580
There's this 10 sided shape,

35:29.580 --> 35:31.800
a decagon with a north and south

35:31.800 --> 35:34.800
as it's designated on
the top and bottom here.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.060
And there's something interesting

35:36.060 --> 35:37.650
about the number of sides and the shape,

35:37.650 --> 35:39.960
and significant I believe as I'll explain

35:39.960 --> 35:41.550
and come back to here in a bit.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.260
But for the time being,
we're gonna move over here

35:43.260 --> 35:46.410
to the left side where
you can see this riddle.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.457
And the riddle goes,

35:48.457 --> 35:50.361
"If you're up the creek with a paddle,

35:50.361 --> 35:52.530
then you'll have an easier time

35:52.530 --> 35:54.090
discovering where they are buried,

35:54.090 --> 35:56.370
otherwise impossible to find.

35:56.370 --> 35:58.920
You can't get here by
walking, so find another way.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.010
Only so many of these nearby
where birds like to stay.

36:02.010 --> 36:03.180
If you figure out the riddle,

36:03.180 --> 36:05.670
you'll be on track to find my sins buried

36:05.670 --> 36:08.550
around a concrete headstone,
which is one of a kind."

36:08.550 --> 36:10.920
So I broke each stanza
down, took some notes,

36:10.920 --> 36:12.690
and this is what I've determined,

36:12.690 --> 36:14.130
whether it's right or wrong.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.237
We'll start with the first stanza here.

36:16.237 --> 36:18.630
"If you're up the creek with a paddle,"

36:18.630 --> 36:20.100
keep in mind it's usually without,

36:20.100 --> 36:22.717
so with is a very important word here.

36:22.717 --> 36:24.480
"If you're up the creek with a paddle,

36:24.480 --> 36:25.860
then you'll have an easier time."

36:25.860 --> 36:28.200
And that to me means if
you have a boat or a canoe

36:28.200 --> 36:29.443
or something with a paddle,

36:29.443 --> 36:32.910
it's gonna be easier to
find whatever this thing is,

36:32.910 --> 36:34.380
which leads me to think
that it has something

36:34.380 --> 36:35.760
to do with water, maybe.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.837
So moving forward.

36:37.837 --> 36:40.410
"You can't get here by
walking, so, find another way.

36:40.410 --> 36:41.760
Again, this supports the idea

36:41.760 --> 36:43.500
that it could be water or boat related.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.780
Maybe you have to swim here, I don't know.

36:45.780 --> 36:47.527
But let's keep moving forward.

36:47.527 --> 36:50.370
"Only so many of these nearby
where birds like to stay."

36:50.370 --> 36:52.620
Now, if you ask me,

36:52.620 --> 36:54.960
this is the most important
part of this entire riddle,

36:54.960 --> 36:56.968
because it's the only line

36:56.968 --> 36:59.610
that doesn't have an obvious answer.

36:59.610 --> 37:01.260
Where do birds like to stay?

37:01.260 --> 37:03.180
I have no idea.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.983
A zoo, power lines maybe.

37:06.017 --> 37:08.370
There's no obvious answer,
so that's what tells me

37:08.370 --> 37:11.280
this is very important
to this whole riddle.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.480
But anyway, I don't wanna digress.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.627
Let's move on.

37:13.627 --> 37:14.460
"If you figure out the riddle,

37:14.460 --> 37:17.070
you will be on track to find my sins

37:17.070 --> 37:20.340
buried around a concrete
headstone, which is one of a kind."

37:20.340 --> 37:23.550
So this is it, or at least
it comes across that way

37:23.550 --> 37:25.980
because you never know when
you're being misdirected

37:25.980 --> 37:28.530
with these puzzles, as I've seen before.

37:28.530 --> 37:32.400
But according to it, if it
is true and it is solved,

37:32.400 --> 37:34.484
it should lead to the remaining victims

37:34.484 --> 37:36.540
of the Lightfoot case.

37:36.540 --> 37:40.630
And how do I know that is
because the shape over here

37:41.550 --> 37:43.650
has 10 sides to it.

37:43.650 --> 37:45.810
It just so happens to
be the exact same number

37:45.810 --> 37:48.300
of missing victims yet to be
found in the Lightfoot case,

37:48.300 --> 37:50.700
so they correlate with each other.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.700
And it's hard not to get a
little bit excited about that

37:53.700 --> 37:56.223
because it tells me this
might be the final clue.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.030
That's pretty exciting.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.110
So now I'm on my computer

38:01.110 --> 38:02.760
and it's time to ask
the internet for help.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.800
And as I usually would
do in this situation,

38:04.800 --> 38:07.080
I would post the clue to social media

38:07.080 --> 38:08.850
and ask for help that way.

38:08.850 --> 38:10.560
However, I don't wanna do that this time

38:10.560 --> 38:12.660
out of fear that this guy could
see what I'm trying to do,

38:12.660 --> 38:13.920
and I don't like that.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.500
So instead, I joined a private forum

38:16.500 --> 38:18.060
that has about 2000 members,

38:18.060 --> 38:20.040
all of which are amateur detectives,

38:20.040 --> 38:24.030
and all they do is try
to solve cold cases.

38:24.030 --> 38:26.070
Pretty impressive what
they've been able to solve.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.440
So right now, I'm gonna
post my clue to their forum

38:28.440 --> 38:32.208
and see if somebody can't
somehow shed some light on it.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.588
hold on, I've got my camera rolling now.

38:48.588 --> 38:50.198
What is it?

38:50.198 --> 38:51.914
- It's a letter
from the same zip code

38:51.914 --> 38:52.747
as the others.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.457
And what does it say?

38:55.457 --> 38:58.080
It says, "I miss my friend."

38:58.080 --> 38:59.511
Can we chat again?

39:04.434 --> 39:06.452
You think you're up for another chat?

39:11.730 --> 39:13.430
I'm ready for this to over, man.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.130
Can this be over?

39:17.130 --> 39:18.211
Oh my God.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.780
All right, so it just turned nine o'clock.

39:42.780 --> 39:43.920
He didn't specify what time,

39:43.920 --> 39:46.820
so I'm assuming it's the same
as before, wouldn't you say?

39:48.091 --> 39:50.515
I mean, it's a guess.

39:50.515 --> 39:54.993
- All right, so I guess I'll
just wait, prick.

39:59.621 --> 40:01.204
All right, he's on.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.667
He says, "Hello friend."

40:07.170 --> 40:08.270
Can I just do what I did last time

40:08.270 --> 40:09.103
and take the lead on this?

40:09.103 --> 40:10.473
- Go for it.
- Okay.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.337
"You really consider us friends?"

40:20.130 --> 40:21.823
He says, "Of course," .

40:23.862 --> 40:25.513
Ask about where she is.

40:26.407 --> 40:28.007
"Please tell me where she is."

40:31.954 --> 40:36.060
He says, "I'm surprised you're
still asking that question."

40:36.060 --> 40:38.080
Well, that means...

40:38.080 --> 40:41.100
That means we should
maybe know where she is.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.663
That's a little funny.

40:43.530 --> 40:45.280
I don't know what he means by that.

40:46.147 --> 40:47.910
"You have a letter coming tomorrow.

40:47.910 --> 40:48.900
I suggest you do what it says.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.817
It says might be helpful."

40:52.110 --> 40:53.523
I guess he sent me a letter.

40:56.527 --> 40:57.360
"Thank you?"

41:09.306 --> 41:11.340
- Yeah I'm here,
so what did you find?

41:11.340 --> 41:13.690
- Okay, I'm gonna read
what it says, all right?

41:14.580 --> 41:17.897
It says, "To speed things
up, to make you understand,

41:17.897 --> 41:20.250
I have decided to give you a hand.

41:20.250 --> 41:23.160
Go to this spot where you
will find a pickle jar

41:23.160 --> 41:24.720
with something inside.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.910
If anyone other than you goes to the spot,

41:26.910 --> 41:29.577
I assure you that I will never be caught."

41:29.577 --> 41:30.930
Is that all it says?

41:30.930 --> 41:34.890
- Yeah, except for he gave
coordinates to a spot,

41:34.890 --> 41:36.990
which is about 10 miles away
from the Lightfoot House.

41:36.990 --> 41:41.990
So man, I'm so upset right now,

41:42.584 --> 41:46.920
but as much as I don't
wanna do it, right now,

41:46.920 --> 41:48.930
I'll do whatever I can to
get this caught.

41:48.930 --> 41:52.016
I can't look over my shoulder
for the rest of my life.

41:52.016 --> 41:57.016
So if you need me to do this, I'll do it.

42:29.048 --> 42:30.499
Hey, can you hear me?

42:30.499 --> 42:31.950
Yeah.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.270
So I'm at the trail head.

42:33.270 --> 42:35.340
I'm gonna head on out if that's okay.

42:35.340 --> 42:36.450
And it's gonna be a while

42:36.450 --> 42:38.408
'cause it's about three miles to the spot.

42:38.408 --> 42:39.508
All right, copy that.

42:39.508 --> 42:40.341
We'll keep our distance,

42:40.341 --> 42:42.251
but let us know if you need
us to move in, all right?

42:42.251 --> 42:44.083
We've got eyes on you.

42:44.083 --> 42:46.900
All right, I'll call you if I need help.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.651
All right, copy that.

42:48.651 --> 42:51.255
See ya.

44:56.521 --> 44:57.354
Hello?

45:01.350 --> 45:02.460
Hey, can you hear me?

45:02.460 --> 45:04.950
Let me call you back on the landline.

45:04.950 --> 45:06.200
I'll call you right back.

45:07.890 --> 45:08.723
Bye.

45:11.580 --> 45:12.993
Hey, so what was it?

45:13.996 --> 45:15.765
- Well, you're
not gonna believe this.

45:15.765 --> 45:18.723
- Try me, I believe just
about anything at this point.

45:19.820 --> 45:21.744
So in the riddle he sent you,

45:21.744 --> 45:24.179
he said, "To speed things
up, to make you understand,

45:24.179 --> 45:26.586
I've decided to give you a hand."

45:26.586 --> 45:27.419
Right.

45:28.720 --> 45:32.027
- Well, he wasn't
being hypothetical.

45:32.027 --> 45:33.175
What?

45:33.175 --> 45:35.474
- Lab says it's been
submerged in formaldehyde

45:35.474 --> 45:36.923
and judging by the level of decay,

45:36.923 --> 45:38.064
it looks like it's been in the jar

45:38.064 --> 45:40.647
for maybe years, decades maybe.

45:43.030 --> 45:44.930
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

45:45.840 --> 45:47.040
We don't know.

45:47.970 --> 45:50.760
I hate to have you stay out
there by yourself tonight.

45:50.760 --> 45:53.073
Sure you don't wanna come to my place?

45:53.073 --> 45:54.840
Man, I wish you'd asked me that sooner.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.820
I'm drunk as right now.

45:56.820 --> 45:59.010
I probably shouldn't be driving.

45:59.010 --> 46:00.390
- All right, well
I can have another officer

46:00.390 --> 46:02.310
stay on the main road
tonight just in case,

46:02.310 --> 46:04.247
but call me if you need
anything, all right?

46:04.247 --> 46:07.350
I don't care if I have to come
all the way out there myself.

46:07.350 --> 46:09.210
I appreciate it, man, thanks.

46:09.210 --> 46:10.440
All right, see you later.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.805
All right, bye.

46:22.860 --> 46:23.693
No way.

46:26.681 --> 46:28.155
No way.

46:37.291 --> 46:38.651
Shit, it's dark.

46:51.780 --> 46:53.820
Well, it's getting late.

46:53.820 --> 46:56.570
I just wanted to come out
and see the creek real quick.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.453
It's been a long day.

47:03.060 --> 47:03.893
There she is.

47:09.856 --> 47:13.605
All right, I'm going to bed.

47:13.605 --> 47:15.272
My cue to go to bed.

49:03.042 --> 49:03.875
Hello?

49:49.049 --> 49:50.400
Yeah?

49:50.400 --> 49:51.233
Hey, it's me man.

49:51.233 --> 49:54.060
So I don't know how to say
this, so I'll just say it.

49:54.060 --> 49:57.579
He was out here at my house last night.

49:57.579 --> 49:59.873
How do you know that?

49:59.873 --> 50:04.873
- Because he left me
something, a little box.

50:05.421 --> 50:07.186
Did you touch it?

50:07.186 --> 50:08.878
I did.

50:08.878 --> 50:10.961
What was in it?

50:14.550 --> 50:18.073
There is a severed human finger inside.

50:20.578 --> 50:23.050
Jesus Christ.

50:23.050 --> 50:25.410
- Also, a little fortune
cookie looking note

50:25.410 --> 50:29.067
that says, "Too late,
better luck next time."

50:31.770 --> 50:32.603
I'm done, man.

50:33.690 --> 50:34.893
I am done.

51:16.077 --> 51:20.310
He says, "I'm surprised you're
still asking that question."

51:20.310 --> 51:22.486
That's a little funny.

51:22.486 --> 51:25.612
I don't know what he means by that.

51:30.137 --> 51:33.293
Ask him where the girl is.

51:33.293 --> 51:37.199
- What's her
name, the missing girl?

51:37.199 --> 51:38.949
It's Susan.

51:42.780 --> 51:44.100
- So you said
the name of the victim

51:44.100 --> 51:45.268
was Susan, right?

51:45.268 --> 51:47.245
Yeah.

51:47.245 --> 51:49.260
- He buried the bottle
with my first kill Susan.

51:49.260 --> 51:51.240
Susan Forrester was
Lightfoot's first victim.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.404
It just so happened to be
the first body I found.

51:53.404 --> 51:54.576
You remember that?

51:54.576 --> 51:55.713
Okay, I still don't know

51:55.713 --> 51:57.090
where you're getting with this.

51:57.090 --> 51:59.250
- So during the second chat
I asked him, I said hey,

51:59.250 --> 52:01.050
please tell me where she is,

52:01.050 --> 52:03.510
referring to the recent Susan, right?

52:03.510 --> 52:06.737
He said, "I'm surprised you're
still asking that question."

52:06.737 --> 52:08.310
Okay?

52:08.310 --> 52:10.740
- It's not a coincidence that
they have the same first name.

52:10.740 --> 52:11.583
It was a clue.

52:13.590 --> 52:15.840
So my question is, has
anyone checked the site

52:15.840 --> 52:17.690
where I found Susan Forrester's body?

52:19.392 --> 52:21.059
Oh my God.

52:22.350 --> 52:23.970
That's what I said.

52:23.970 --> 52:27.221
Call me back please when you
find out what is going on.

52:27.221 --> 52:29.029
- All right,
I'll call you back soon.

52:29.029 --> 52:30.916
All right, see ya.

52:43.590 --> 52:44.430
Good evening.

52:44.430 --> 52:46.489
Breaking news as we
come on the air tonight.

52:46.489 --> 52:48.630
A body was discovered this afternoon

52:48.630 --> 52:51.420
at an undisclosed location
as authorities have stated

52:51.420 --> 52:53.331
that they will not be
making any statements

52:53.331 --> 52:55.290
due to the situation being a part

52:55.290 --> 52:57.390
of an ongoing investigation.

52:57.390 --> 52:59.790
However, rumors have circulated
that the body is believed

52:59.790 --> 53:02.353
to be that of 27 year
old Susan McAllister,

53:02.353 --> 53:05.220
who went missing only a few weeks ago.

53:05.220 --> 53:07.585
We will continue to try and
bring you more information

53:07.585 --> 53:08.973
as the story unfolds.

53:15.450 --> 53:17.460
- Please tell me there was
nothing else we could have done.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.968
We did everything we could've, right?

53:19.968 --> 53:22.278
You couldn't have stopped him.

53:22.278 --> 53:25.278
He always knew how it was gonna end.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.526
You sure it was her?

53:27.526 --> 53:30.066
- Yep, positive
ID from the parents,

53:30.066 --> 53:31.264
missing a finger.

53:31.264 --> 53:32.267
There was also a photograph
sitting next to the body

53:33.605 --> 53:35.504
of him torturing her, so...

53:35.504 --> 53:36.754
Jesus Christ.

53:37.993 --> 53:39.660
Who is he, a copycat?

53:39.660 --> 53:41.458
Is that what you call him?

53:41.458 --> 53:44.140
- It would appear that
way, except for one thing.

53:44.140 --> 53:45.273
What, what's that?

53:46.259 --> 53:48.293
- We checked the
DNA of the hand from the jar

53:48.293 --> 53:50.400
that you found and we matched it to a swab

53:50.400 --> 53:53.109
taken from the clue you found in the wall.

53:53.109 --> 53:54.601
Can you repeat all that?

53:54.601 --> 53:56.640
I didn't understand a word you said.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.380
Pretend I'm a wasted three year old

53:58.380 --> 54:00.765
because I didn't get any of it.

54:00.765 --> 54:03.067
It means the hand from the jar

54:03.067 --> 54:05.653
is the same from the clue.

54:11.537 --> 54:12.370
What?

55:17.522 --> 55:18.355
Yeah?

55:18.355 --> 55:22.560
- Hey, so he just sent
me a picture via chat.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.150
It sounds like it's what
maybe you guys found

55:24.150 --> 55:27.000
next to her body today, but yeah,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.018
I just figured I'd let you know.

55:28.018 --> 55:29.672
All right, send it to my email

55:29.672 --> 55:31.912
when you get a chance
so I can confirm that.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.432
Okay.

55:33.432 --> 55:37.740
You doing all right?

55:37.740 --> 55:38.781
No.

57:49.969 --> 57:54.386
- Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.

58:04.225 --> 58:07.725
Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.

59:29.758 --> 59:33.258
Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.

59:52.057 --> 59:54.360
- "A group of us are still
trying to figure out your puzzle,

59:54.360 --> 59:55.841
but the vagueness is
throwing us for a loop

59:55.841 --> 59:57.750
so nothing new yet.

59:57.750 --> 59:59.040
I'm a big fan of what you're doing,

59:59.040 --> 1:00:01.943
so I'm staying on top of this
personally and won't give up.

1:00:02.850 --> 1:00:04.077
Sincerely, Jordan."

1:00:23.460 --> 1:00:24.293
Hello?

1:00:24.293 --> 1:00:25.390
Hey, you got a second?

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:28.140
Yeah, hey, let me call you right back.

1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:30.390
I've got my hands full, hold on.

1:00:30.390 --> 1:00:32.355
Hey, so what's going on?

1:00:32.355 --> 1:00:33.911
So you can't tell anybody

1:00:33.911 --> 1:00:35.970
what I'm about to tell you, okay?

1:00:35.970 --> 1:00:38.100
At least until we know it's for sure.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:39.300
Okay, what's going on?

1:00:41.243 --> 1:00:43.740
We think we have a suspect.

1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:44.573
Shut up.

1:00:45.609 --> 1:00:47.194
- The picture that
he sent you last night

1:00:47.194 --> 1:00:48.843
through the chatroom is different

1:00:48.843 --> 1:00:51.330
than the one we found next to the body.

1:00:51.330 --> 1:00:52.163
Okay, yeah?

1:00:52.163 --> 1:00:53.213
- Are you by chance
looking at the picture?

1:00:54.282 --> 1:00:55.650
No, I'm in my garage.

1:00:55.650 --> 1:00:56.520
Can I call you right back?

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:59.760
I'll pull it up on my
computer, hold on, hold on.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:01.200
Okay, so I've got the picture pulled up,

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:02.850
but I don't see anything special about it.

1:01:02.850 --> 1:01:03.960
What am I looking for?

1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:05.695
- So look at the
left side of the picture

1:01:05.695 --> 1:01:10.146
and tell me what you
see, on the boat trailer.

1:01:10.146 --> 1:01:12.832
Oh my god.

1:01:12.832 --> 1:01:14.155
Exactly.

1:01:14.155 --> 1:01:16.562
We were able to run it and
even with only four characters,

1:01:16.562 --> 1:01:18.935
we know exactly who it belongs to.

1:01:18.935 --> 1:01:20.537
We're planning to pay him a visit

1:01:20.537 --> 1:01:21.933
first think tomorrow morning to ask him

1:01:21.933 --> 1:01:25.044
how his license plate
ended up at a crime scene.

1:01:25.044 --> 1:01:27.392
Dude, I think you got him.

1:01:27.392 --> 1:01:29.635
- I'll call you
back when we find something.

1:01:29.635 --> 1:01:31.615
Like I said, it'll probably
be tomorrow morning.

1:01:31.615 --> 1:01:34.786
But until then, don't tell a soul.

1:01:34.786 --> 1:01:36.709
I promise, I won't tell anybody.

1:01:36.709 --> 1:01:37.637
All right, I gotta go.

1:01:37.637 --> 1:01:38.470
I'll talk to you later.

1:01:38.470 --> 1:01:39.713
- All right, cool man,
I'll talk to you later.

1:01:39.713 --> 1:01:40.796
See you, bye.

1:02:43.734 --> 1:02:46.062
Hey, I just had to pull
over and start the cameras.

1:02:46.062 --> 1:02:49.197
Will you repeat exactly
what you just told me?

1:02:49.197 --> 1:02:50.968
We got him.

1:02:50.968 --> 1:02:53.740
And you're sure it's him?

1:02:53.740 --> 1:02:54.573
Oh, it's him.

1:02:54.573 --> 1:02:56.131
We arrested him this
morning, dead to rights.

1:02:56.131 --> 1:02:58.143
Found all sorts of stuff in his garage,

1:02:58.143 --> 1:03:00.805
like pictures and pieces
of bloody clothing,

1:03:00.805 --> 1:03:01.765
that license plate.

1:03:01.765 --> 1:03:03.343
Absolutely no doubt it's our guy.

1:03:03.343 --> 1:03:05.130
Oh my God, this is awesome!

1:03:05.130 --> 1:03:06.762
Did you see the guy, did you see him?

1:03:06.762 --> 1:03:07.643
- I was the one
who read him his rights.

1:03:08.850 --> 1:03:10.522
Shut the up!

1:03:10.522 --> 1:03:11.801
Shut up.

1:03:11.801 --> 1:03:14.163
What was he like, was he scary?

1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:17.278
- No, he actually
came across as very nice,

1:03:17.278 --> 1:03:18.979
a gentle older man.

1:03:18.979 --> 1:03:20.312
He's in his 70s.

1:03:21.780 --> 1:03:24.201
What did he say when you confronted him?

1:03:24.201 --> 1:03:25.629
- Well, he acted
like he had no idea

1:03:25.629 --> 1:03:27.165
what we were talking about.

1:03:27.165 --> 1:03:29.341
His wife claims he suffers
from schizophrenia.

1:03:29.341 --> 1:03:31.141
And honestly, based on first impressions,

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.847
I thought we had the wrong guy.

1:03:32.847 --> 1:03:35.202
You know, when we opened up the garage,

1:03:35.202 --> 1:03:36.750
there was no denying it.

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:38.250
Well man, you just made my day.

1:03:38.250 --> 1:03:39.600
Thank you so much for calling me.

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:41.460
This is fantastic news!

1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:43.032
Thank you.

1:03:43.032 --> 1:03:45.357
- Well, I wanted
to be first to let you know

1:03:45.357 --> 1:03:47.752
because, you know, you deserve it.

1:03:47.752 --> 1:03:50.587
And I swear we may have never caught him

1:03:50.587 --> 1:03:52.890
if you didn't keep stepping up, so...

1:03:52.890 --> 1:03:54.240
Well, I appreciate that, man.

1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:56.581
In all honesty, I'm just
glad this is all over.

1:03:56.581 --> 1:03:58.308
Well hey, we're pulling up

1:03:58.308 --> 1:04:00.210
to the station right now
so I gotta hop off here.

1:04:00.210 --> 1:04:01.043
I'll talk to you in a bit, okay?

1:04:01.043 --> 1:04:02.220
All right, cool man.

1:04:02.220 --> 1:04:03.813
Hey, good job, I appreciate it.

1:04:04.890 --> 1:04:07.290
Hey mom, you're not gonna believe this.

1:04:07.290 --> 1:04:08.370
They caught him.

1:04:08.370 --> 1:04:10.170
So I'm gonna come over to your
house and pick up the kids.

1:04:10.170 --> 1:04:11.003
All right?

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:12.833
All right, I love you.

1:04:12.833 --> 1:04:14.643
I'll see you in a second, bye.

1:04:16.950 --> 1:04:19.080
My day just got a little bit better.

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:19.953
Wow!

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.223
Wow, it's over.

1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:27.360
And at the root of it, a
70 something year old man.

1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:29.370
What the hell is that all about?

1:04:29.370 --> 1:04:30.203
Oh my God.

1:04:30.203 --> 1:04:31.470
Well, it's over.

1:04:31.470 --> 1:04:32.424
I don't care.

1:05:15.237 --> 1:05:16.593
All right, rolling.

1:05:19.170 --> 1:05:21.900
So I'm sitting here
looking at all the footage

1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:23.460
I've been shooting over
the past few weeks,

1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:24.930
and I'm starting to quickly realize

1:05:24.930 --> 1:05:26.910
that there's very little ghost activity.

1:05:26.910 --> 1:05:29.430
But you know, at the root of it,

1:05:29.430 --> 1:05:32.220
it was just too interesting
of an experience not to film.

1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:35.679
So I filmed it and this is what I got.

1:05:35.679 --> 1:05:37.230
It's basically gonna be a movie

1:05:37.230 --> 1:05:39.780
about a man who terrorized me.

1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:42.510
But you know, now that he's been caught,

1:05:42.510 --> 1:05:44.940
I hope to go back to what I like to do,

1:05:44.940 --> 1:05:47.880
which is I hate to say a ghost hunt.

1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:50.480
But if somebody asked me, you know,

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:53.310
if you didn't get a chance to
film any of this crazy stuff

1:05:53.310 --> 1:05:54.870
that happened, would you be upset?

1:05:54.870 --> 1:05:57.750
And my answer will be no,

1:05:57.750 --> 1:05:59.040
because I'm just that happy

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.690
that things can finally go
back to the way they were.

1:06:03.270 --> 1:06:05.463
I'm just glad it's over.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:12.266
It feels good.

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.142
Hello?

1:06:27.142 --> 1:06:29.190
Hey, it's mom.

1:06:29.190 --> 1:06:30.390
Hey mom, can I call you right back?

1:06:30.390 --> 1:06:32.187
I'm in the middle of filming something.

1:06:32.187 --> 1:06:33.475
Yeah, that's fine.

1:06:33.475 --> 1:06:34.672
But I thought I'd let you know,

1:06:34.672 --> 1:06:37.789
I was just at your house just
to pick up the kids' laundry

1:06:37.789 --> 1:06:41.312
and I noticed there was a
letter taped to your front door.

1:06:41.312 --> 1:06:43.694
- What kind of letter,
from the HOA or something?

1:06:43.694 --> 1:06:48.277
- I don't think so, it
has a question mark on it.

1:06:53.681 --> 1:06:57.000
Okay, I'm heading home right now.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.137
Stay away from it, don't touch it.

1:07:22.627 --> 1:07:24.210
"As you read this letter,

1:07:24.210 --> 1:07:26.100
you'll feel the fear progressively grow

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:28.353
as you come to realize
the game isn't over,

1:07:29.220 --> 1:07:31.290
that your strings were
pulled like a marionette

1:07:31.290 --> 1:07:32.550
by a master puppeteer

1:07:32.550 --> 1:07:34.743
who now considers you his favorite puppet.

1:07:36.090 --> 1:07:38.583
So a riddle for my new
friend to hold you over.

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:44.403
Did you know a father can be
a father, regardless of law,

1:07:45.300 --> 1:07:48.033
regardless of genetics, regardless of all?

1:07:49.470 --> 1:07:50.400
What makes a father

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:52.380
can be an opinion one sees because to me,

1:07:52.380 --> 1:07:54.933
a father is a father who
did what he did for me.

1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:59.100
He loved me enough to
put a gun to his head,

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:01.023
to write a letter to say what he said,

1:08:01.950 --> 1:08:04.410
to let them know it was him and not me

1:08:04.410 --> 1:08:06.723
because that is what
he wanted them to see.

1:08:07.890 --> 1:08:11.730
So a wrinkle for your
brain as it is about time,

1:08:11.730 --> 1:08:14.380
the puzzles and murders you
thought were my father's

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:16.710
have always been mine."

1:08:41.556 --> 1:08:45.973
- Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.

1:08:56.095 --> 1:08:59.595
Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.

1:09:08.982 --> 1:09:12.482
Danger, D-A-N-G-E-R.
