01:36.137 --> 01:38.199
- Good afternoon, Detective.
- How's it going, Patrice?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.475
- Not bad. Call for you.
- Great, send it back.

01:42.977 --> 01:47.023
There are 77 '93 white Mazda pickups
in Colorado.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.859
And I want a couple officers
to photograph every one of them.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.861
So, when McCarthy's defense tries to say,

01:51.945 --> 01:53.947
"How do you know the Mazda in the video
is his?"

01:54.030 --> 01:56.592
We'll be able to show that
McCarthy's is the only one in the state

01:56.616 --> 01:59.577
- with those markings.
- Yeah. Detective Parker,

01:59.661 --> 02:02.163
this is Detective Rasmussen
from Westminster, Colorado.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.248
How ya doin' today?

02:03.331 --> 02:05.834
Not half bad. How can I help you?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.377
Actually, I think this might be me
helping you.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.881
We caught a serial rapist
here in Colorado recently.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.984
- Good for you.
<i>- Yeah, thank you.</i>

02:14.008 --> 02:16.719
And, uh, in going through his stuff,
we came across evidence

02:16.803 --> 02:19.681
related to an unsolved case of yours
from a couple years back.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.225
A... a rape?

02:22.308 --> 02:25.854
That's right.
Victim's name is Marie Adler.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.066
Oh, wow. That one.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.276
Yes, sir.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.361
<i>Uh, yeah, that wasn't unsolved.</i>

02:33.444 --> 02:34.696
It was dismissed.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.781
She, uh, made it up.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.575
Are we talking about the same Marie Adler?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.911
Date of birth 04/06/90. Five foot three.
110 pounds.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.164
<i>Yep, that's her. A complicated kid.</i>

02:44.247 --> 02:47.500
It's pretty sad, actually. We ended up
having to charge her with false reporting.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.129
<i>I mean, I felt bad for her,
but, you know, the law's the law.</i>

02:52.380 --> 02:54.799
Detective, would you mind giving me
your email address?

02:55.175 --> 02:59.929
<i>Sure. Uh, it's parker@lynnwoodpd.com.</i>

03:03.391 --> 03:06.271
Okay, I'm sending you something.
You let me know when you get it.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.440
I just got it.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.002
<i>Yeah, when we were
going through our guy's stuff,</i>

03:13.026 --> 03:15.195
<i>we found pictures of his victims.</i>

03:16.237 --> 03:18.031
<i>Most were of women we already knew about.</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:21.367
<i>The one I'm sending you, uh,
was the only one we didn't recognize.</i>

03:28.833 --> 03:29.833
<i>Did it open?</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:39.143
<i>- </i> Detective?
<i>- Yeah. Yes.</i>

03:39.886 --> 03:41.721
<i>We have seven more of her.</i>

03:41.804 --> 03:43.932
<i>The others are harder to look at.</i>

03:46.684 --> 03:48.895
I'll send them along,
so you have everything.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.616
Yeah... okay.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.869
So long.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.749
What was that?

04:26.891 --> 04:29.269
Detective Parker
to see Detective Rasmussen.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.607
Hey, Gonzalez called.
He needs us to go through our files

04:34.691 --> 04:37.652
and add up how many times McCarthy
stopped and started for each victim.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.196
He can use each time he reentered
as a new rape charge.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.280
Oh, I can do that.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.449
Oh, look who's landed.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.164
Detective Parker?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.541
Yes, hi.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.085
Grace Rasmussen.
Nice of you to come all this way.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.168
We're in here.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.767
That's a lot of paperwork.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.478
It includes all our dead ends.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.943
So, coffee, tea,
shitty snacks are over there in corner.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.029
<i>Mi</i> junk food <i>es su</i> junk food.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.490
Thanks.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.519
That's good work.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.896
That's very good work.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.564
Thank you.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.029
Looks like you have enough
to... send him away for a long time.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.115
Mmm, I don't count my chickens.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.077
I've seen rapists get probation
too many times to count on anything.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.956
Here, why, uh, why don't I walk you out?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.593
I feel like... um...

07:09.345 --> 07:10.847
I should explain.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.434
The problem is, uh...

07:16.269 --> 07:18.688
I've got... nothing.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.905
You know, you hear about bad cops.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.617
You know, guys who make bad calls
or end up hurting the people

07:31.701 --> 07:33.821
they're supposed to protect,
and I always think, like,

07:33.870 --> 07:36.956
who the hell let him on the force, right?
Just get rid of him.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.172
Maybe we should get rid of me.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.806
Well, thank you.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.183
You bet.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.618
Hi, Marie.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.164
You got a couple minutes?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.718
Sorry to bother you at work.
This won't take long.

09:54.927 --> 09:55.927
Um...

09:55.970 --> 10:00.558
I got some information... recently
that I need to share with you.

10:00.641 --> 10:04.812
Uh, I was contacted by some detectives
in Colorado last week.

10:05.354 --> 10:09.483
They apprehended a... a rapist,
and when they looked through his stuff,

10:09.567 --> 10:11.110
they found a picture of you.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.490
Eight, actually. Eight pictures.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.620
Taken during an assault.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.206
During your assault.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.169
The one I didn't believe. The one I...

10:29.587 --> 10:31.797
made you say never happened.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.972
I figured you wouldn't want to see me,
but I...

10:40.848 --> 10:43.017
felt it was important
to tell you in person.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.104
To look you in the eye
and tell you I was wrong.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.400
I mean, I've been trying to figure out
how I could have been so off.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.611
I wish I had an answer. I don't.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.410
I'd do anything to go back,
and redo the whole thing.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.081
To just start all over
and do right by you. I really would.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.380
Well, you can't.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.473
There's one more thing.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.979
This is for you. It's from the City.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.816
I sent one of these
over to the DA's office too.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.026
It's everything I lifted
off McCarthy's electronics.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.358
There were too many to print, so I zipped
thumbnails and put them on a drive.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.466
There's also a list
of everything he downloaded.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.366
Mm.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.619
Check out the books. There's one in there
called <i>The Rape Forensics Guide.</i>

13:48.702 --> 13:51.539
He had that? Why am I surprised?
Of course, he had that.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.416
- You've heard of it?
- Yeah, it's written by cops.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
I saw that.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.478
They didn't think it through, did they?

13:57.837 --> 13:58.838
No, they did not.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.899
There's one more thing
that's bugging the shit out of me.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.634
- What's that?
- He had a hard drive, 75 gigs.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.010
He protected it with TrueCrypt.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.989
It's this encryption software
no one's figured out how to bust into yet.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.056
Seventy-five gigs is big.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.819
Huge. It's an entire floor of the library.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.971
You can't see what's in it?

14:12.017 --> 14:14.617
Nope. All I can see are the names
of the files he dragged into it.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.065
The main one was just called "Girls."
He dragged other files into that one.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.569
Each one had a name. Amber. Sarah. Lilly.
And a bunch of other names.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.363
Women he was stalking?
Other women he's raped?

14:24.738 --> 14:25.573
I...

14:25.656 --> 14:27.676
No, I know. Is there anything
that can tell you anything?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.076
Not about content, no.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.429
- You gotta get in there.
- I'm trying. Like I said...

14:31.453 --> 14:34.415
Oh, I know, it's impossible,
I'm just saying, you have to.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.795
- He's gotta get in there.
- I know.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.673
I mean, who knows
what else this guy has done?

14:42.756 --> 14:43.756
I know.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.968
Well, he wants to plead guilty.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.262
You're kidding.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.490
Nope. His lawyer said
he wants to get it over with.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.394
Not put his victims
through the pain of a trial.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.474
Oh, now he's concerned
about their comfort.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.644
It's not a bad move.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.355
Depending on the judge,
it could really reduce his jail time.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.241
- So, straight to sentencing.
- That's right.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.860
- When?
- Couple months.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.987
Take us a beat to get our ducks in a row.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.071
And he has one condition.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.799
He'll only do it if we drop
the kidnapping charges.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.534
Wait, so he'll plead guilty
to multiple rapes

15:10.618 --> 15:13.621
but doesn't like the charge of kidnapping
'cause it'll hurt his reputation?

15:13.704 --> 15:16.373
Detective, if I try to understand
every criminal I prosecute...

15:16.457 --> 15:17.791
Okay, talk to the victims.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.755
I won't drop the kidnapping
unless they okay it.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.253
We'll ask.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.589
Hang on, if our women agree to this,
you'll counter?

15:23.672 --> 15:24.672
Yep.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.819
So, tell him you'll only drop kidnapping
if he gives up the password

15:27.843 --> 15:29.011
to his hard drive.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.014
I want to know every hideous thing
this guy's done.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.046
I hear you, y... you're not wrong,

15:46.070 --> 15:47.947
but I... I can't get into it right now.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.615
Yeah, no, let's talk on Friday.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.785
Uh... um...

15:52.868 --> 15:55.287
Marie, um... eh, don't tell me.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.539
- Adler.
- Adler. I told you not to tell me.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.958
What brings you around here?

15:59.041 --> 16:02.294
Wait. Oh, shoot. Walk with me.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.421
No offense, Marie,

16:04.505 --> 16:06.505
but I was hoping never to see you again.
What's up?

16:06.548 --> 16:08.342
Oh, I need a lawyer.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.594
Uh-oh. What happened?

16:10.678 --> 16:12.238
No, no, no, I'm not the one in trouble.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.765
I just need to press charges
against someone else.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.184
Oh, well, I'm not...
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.479
Well, I know, but I... I thought
you might know someone who was.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.898
Well, who do you want to sue?

16:23.315 --> 16:26.360
Pretty much everybody,
but I thought I'd start with the City.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.615
The same... you got the same number?

16:31.699 --> 16:32.699
Yeah.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.743
I'll get you a name.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.671
Yeah, Don and I
went to law school together.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.650
Spent more time on the basketball court
than in the library,

16:48.674 --> 16:50.509
but somehow it worked out.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.803
Uh, water, coffee?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.140
Oh, uh, no, thanks.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.310
So, he sent me
your case file, which...

17:03.272 --> 17:04.857
By the way, let me just say,

17:04.940 --> 17:08.861
what happened to you should not happen
to anyone, ever.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.448
Yeah, well.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.784
You know, no one ever accuses
a robbery victim of lying

17:15.867 --> 17:17.911
or someone who says he was carjacked.

17:17.994 --> 17:18.994
Doesn't happen.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.957
But when it comes to sexual assault...

17:26.170 --> 17:27.296
Anyway, have a seat.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.384
So, Don told me about the check
they gave you.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.886
Reimbursement for your fine.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.763
How do you feel about that?

17:35.846 --> 17:41.643
Well, at first, I was like, "$500, cool."

17:43.270 --> 17:49.026
But then I got to thinking that there were
other things that I lost because of this.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.780
Like... my job,

17:53.614 --> 17:54.615
my housing,

17:55.699 --> 17:56.992
free counselors.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.371
Plus, you know... friendships.

18:02.372 --> 18:06.710
And I know, it's, like, "Hey,
$500 that you didn't have yesterday,"

18:06.794 --> 18:09.797
but my whole life, I've just been, like,

18:10.589 --> 18:15.094
"Take what you get,
and just be happy that it's not worse."

18:18.180 --> 18:20.682
But something about this
made me feel like...

18:24.812 --> 18:26.772
maybe that's not good enough this time.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.318
You know what happens when you decide
you're not gonna just

18:31.610 --> 18:32.945
take what you get anymore?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.029
What?

18:36.448 --> 18:37.533
You get more.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.765
- Okay, so I spoke to our victims.
- Hello to you too, Detective.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.601
Oh, hey, uh,...they're
okay with you dropping kidnapping

18:46.625 --> 18:48.144
- and not going to trial...
- Excellent.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.480
...as long as they can address the court
at his sentencing.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.232
They wanna look him in the eye.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.633
Yeah, sure, of course.
I gotta take this, thanks.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.011
- Hang on. What about the password?
- Oh, yeah. No, he won't give it up.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.095
What do you mean? He's a fucking rapist.
How about he doesn't have a choice?

19:01.723 --> 19:03.767
- What should I do? Waterboard him?
- Can you?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.663
Just tell him, if he doesn't cough it up,
you're goin' to trial,

19:06.687 --> 19:07.727
kidnapping and everything.

19:07.771 --> 19:11.066
I have a serial rapist who's pleading
guilty to 30 counts of sexual assault.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.245
Okay? I'm not gonna blow this
on a password.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.863
- Gonzalez. Ah, shit.
- There are other women on there.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.116
Don't you wanna know who they are,
what happened?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.742
Yes, but I'm not gonna risk going to trial
with this guy. Okay?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.161
See you at the sentencing.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
You good?

19:41.221 --> 19:42.221
Yeah.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.311
You okay?

20:43.617 --> 20:44.826
Hey, there she is.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.369
Come on in.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.336
<i>I have nightmares.</i>

20:55.587 --> 20:59.549
I am scared... all of the time.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.968
Every minute of every day.

21:01.051 --> 21:05.847
My friends try to help me,
but I have a hard time trusting people.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.225
Uh, I can't sleep.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.726
I'm in pain.

21:12.813 --> 21:13.939
I've lost weight.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.566
I've lost work. I've lost money.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.279
I have violent thoughts.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.990
I've never had violent thoughts before,
ever.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.243
You think it's just one night.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.370
Compared to all of the other minutes
of my life,

21:28.453 --> 21:31.623
how could this one short incident
make a difference? But...

21:34.293 --> 21:35.419
it does.

21:37.629 --> 21:43.051
Your Honor, what I really want to do
is I wanna ask the defendant a question.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.219
Can I do that?

21:44.594 --> 21:45.679
By all means.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.351
Why did you pick me?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.856
What was I doing
that made you wanna come for me?

21:55.939 --> 21:58.358
I'm so scared of doing it again.

21:58.442 --> 22:03.113
I don't water my lawn anymore.
I... I don't read by the window.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.200
They say that routines
make you vulnerable,

22:07.284 --> 22:10.078
so anything routine, I just stopped doing.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.292
It's made my world very small,

22:15.375 --> 22:17.502
and I still don't feel safe.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.589
I think if I just knew what it was,
what I did.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.385
If I knew what that one thing was,
then I'd stop doing it

22:25.469 --> 22:27.721
and then maybe
I could get my life back again.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.977
Your Honor,
Mr. McCarthy has other victims,

22:34.603 --> 22:37.856
ones who weren't up to being here today
and seeing him.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.152
They want to be sure you don't misread
their absence as indifference

22:42.444 --> 22:45.197
'cause they care about
what is happening here today

22:45.280 --> 22:46.740
more than you can imagine.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.286
If at any point
in the near or distant future,

22:51.370 --> 22:53.121
Mr. McCarthy is a free man,

22:53.663 --> 22:55.874
they will not feel safe...

22:56.625 --> 22:57.625
ever.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.504
And these women deserve to feel safe.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.926
Bottom line is
they don't want to go to trial,

23:06.009 --> 23:07.302
which is good.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.136
Neither do we.

23:10.138 --> 23:10.972
Why not?

23:11.056 --> 23:14.101
Because they will try to make you look
as bad as they do.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.897
They already did that once,
let's not give them another swing at it.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.861
So, everyone wants a settlement,
the question is how much.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.489
We have an offer.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.659
It's just an opening. We'll go back.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.370
How much is it for?

23:33.453 --> 23:35.330
A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.586
They wanna give me a $150,000?

23:41.670 --> 23:44.381
No, they don't want
to give you anything,

23:44.881 --> 23:47.801
but that is what they're willing
to give you to bury this.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.054
Tell them I'll take it.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.724
No, look, we can do much better.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.101
I... I don't need better.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.229
A hundred and fifty thousand dollars
is a lot of money.

23:59.479 --> 24:02.039
It's enough for me to get out of here,
start over somewhere else.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.445
Plus, really, all I need is for them
to acknowledge what they did to me.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.197
And this does that.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.743
I'd like them to acknowledge it more.

24:14.828 --> 24:15.829
Like, double.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.126
I want this to be over.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.840
Mr. McCarthy...

24:33.180 --> 24:35.265
you treated these women
as if they were your prey.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.143
Your actions were pure evil.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.481
And because of this, you have lost
the privilege of living in a free society.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.232
I'm assessing the maximum penalty.

24:44.316 --> 24:48.862
I am sentencing you to 327
and one half years in prison.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.307
Fucking A.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.851
This court is now adjourned.
Thank you.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.782
Okay. So, confession time.

26:15.865 --> 26:20.036
Uh, I, uh... I did something this morning
that I've never done before.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.413
Uh-oh. I'm a little scared.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.124
I prayed.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.167
Shut up, you did not.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.753
I did. I bowed my head and I said,

26:29.254 --> 26:30.297
"Listen, motherfucker,

26:30.380 --> 26:33.425
you let all this horrible shit go down
day after day after day.

26:33.508 --> 26:37.220
Is it too much to ask on this one day,
you get one fucking thing right"?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.888
And look, it worked.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.642
- Hey, did you tell her yet?
- Tell me what?

26:42.726 --> 26:44.269
This is it. Right here.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.313
We don't need to get into this.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.982
What do you mean?
What don't we, uh, need to get into?

26:49.065 --> 26:51.318
This is the exact spot
where Max the Knife was born.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.694
Who?

26:52.777 --> 26:54.696
His alter ego. Come on, tell her.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.741
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on.

26:58.325 --> 27:03.163
- I gotta take a piss.
- Oh, no! What? Come on, tell me.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.541
I don't like that.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.628
Uh, that is because you have a problem
with control.

27:09.711 --> 27:12.380
Oh, I have a problem with control.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.507
- Wow, me.
- Yeah.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.052
If you don't have every little piece
of information...

27:17.135 --> 27:19.346
if you don't make
all the decisions yourself... whoa.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.682
- So, I'm sorry, can you hear this?
- Whatever it is, I agree with Grace.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.393
I'm just saying,
if you could loosen up a little...

27:25.477 --> 27:32.275
Oh, please, you are, like, the least
loose loose person I have ever met.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.277
You're, like, faux-loose.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.696
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

- Evening.
- Hey.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.257
Uh, interesting update.
Chris McCarthy's lawyer called,

28:37.340 --> 28:38.967
says he wants to be interviewed.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.428
Says he wants to explain himself.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.596
He thinks it could be helpful
to law enforcement.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.058
- Are you serious? We get to talk to him?
- No, not you, just me.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.062
Believe it or not,
women make him uncomfortable.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.405
<i>Well, the problem is
you're always a step behind.</i>

29:01.406 --> 29:02.449
<i>You're reacting.</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:07.954
<i>You wanna catch guys like me,
you gotta get out ahead of us.</i>

29:08.037 --> 29:12.208
<i>Anticipate,
because we think about this a lot.</i>

29:13.376 --> 29:14.376
<i>And we're smart.</i>

29:15.211 --> 29:16.291
<i>Smart how?</i>

29:16.337 --> 29:18.590
<i>Careful with prints. Careful with DNA.</i>

29:18.673 --> 29:21.676
<i>It's like being out in the wilderness.
Leave no trace.</i>

29:21.760 --> 29:23.760
<i>It's easier to catch guys like you</i>

29:23.803 --> 29:24.822
<i>when they're just starting out.</i>

29:24.846 --> 29:28.558
<i>Well, it's like anything. You know,
the more you do it, the better you get.</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:32.937
<i>That first one, up in Washington?</i>

29:33.897 --> 29:37.192
<i>I left... all kinds of stuff behind.</i>

29:37.275 --> 29:38.275
<i>Hair, fluids.</i>

29:38.943 --> 29:42.447
<i>All I could think about was all that DNA,
you know, all over the place.</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:46.159
<i>All they had to do was compare it
to my military records.</i>

29:46.242 --> 29:49.996
<i>I was dead sure they were gonna knock
on my door the next day and take me away.</i>

29:50.705 --> 29:51.790
<i>But nothing happened.</i>

29:53.166 --> 29:54.167
<i>And so you think...</i>

29:55.418 --> 29:56.418
<i>"Okay.</i>

29:57.921 --> 29:59.672
<i>Cool, I guess I can do this."</i>

30:06.387 --> 30:08.223
Hey, we got the guy.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.437
Okay.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.231
What is it?

30:18.691 --> 30:19.818
You know...

30:20.860 --> 30:25.073
...it's all the other sociopaths out there
with their rape kits and their guns,

30:25.156 --> 30:29.285
thinking... "Hey, I guess I can do this."

30:30.203 --> 30:31.203
You can't do that.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.082
You can't take on
all the bad guys at once.

30:35.041 --> 30:38.545
We did a good thing getting this guy.
Let it be a good thing.

30:43.883 --> 30:48.012
You got the job done.
Cheer the fuck up. God!

30:50.390 --> 30:51.391
Okay.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.933
Yes!

30:55.979 --> 30:58.898
- "One day's burden is enough for one day."
- Exactly.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.568
"One day's burden is enough for one day."
I like that.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.027
It's from the <i>Bible.</i>

31:03.945 --> 31:06.489
- Shut up.
- Matthew 6:34.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.991
Whatever that means.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.581
<i>Do you feel remorse?</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:17.876
<i>I mean,
I know I can't be out there.</i>

31:18.793 --> 31:20.295
<i>I wasn't ever gonna stop.</i>

31:32.390 --> 31:34.267
Congratulations, hon,
drive carefully.

31:34.350 --> 31:35.184
Thank you.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.329
- You can just pay the clerk at window C.
- Thank you.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.105
- Yes, sir, how can I help you?
- Hi...

31:41.983 --> 31:43.151
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

31:43.234 --> 31:44.986
Could you take my picture for me?

31:45.236 --> 31:46.236
Sure.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.415
There you go.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.629
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.399
Parker.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.570
Um...

33:11.322 --> 33:13.658
Yeah. Yes, send her up.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.577
Oh, okay.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.914
I'll come down.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.308
Marie, hi.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.939
Uh, do you want to go somewhere,
so we can talk?

33:45.023 --> 33:48.067
No. I don't really wanna
be alone with you.

33:48.484 --> 33:49.861
You understand that, right?

33:50.653 --> 33:51.653
I guess so.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.613
Yes.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.075
So, I got my $500 back.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.537
And I got more money from the City,
as you probably know.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.620
I do.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.714
You know what I never got...

34:11.549 --> 34:12.549
ever...

34:13.342 --> 34:14.385
from anybody?

34:16.429 --> 34:17.554
An apology.

34:20.016 --> 34:23.351
Even I know, when you mess up,
you apologize.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.313
And when you mess up so bad,

34:26.688 --> 34:28.649
when your one stupid mistake

34:28.733 --> 34:30.735
ruins a person's entire life,

34:31.069 --> 34:32.402
you apologize more.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.487
I'm sorry.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.453
I'm very, very sorry.

34:47.752 --> 34:48.795
Next time...

34:50.004 --> 34:51.005
do better.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.217
Okay.

35:13.736 --> 35:16.489
I was really hoping he would give up
that goddamn password.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.783
Jason said he'd keep at it
in his free time.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.369
- He has free time?
- Not really, no.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.036
Hey...

35:23.371 --> 35:24.413
um...

35:25.748 --> 35:26.999
Listen, before you go...

35:28.042 --> 35:31.295
- I just wanted to say...
- Oh, no, no, don't. Please.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.443
- Don't what?
- Do that thing, that...

35:33.756 --> 35:37.552
sincere "this has meant the world to me"
woman-bonding thing.

35:37.635 --> 35:41.013
No, I... I was not going to woman-bond.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.557
- Bullshit.
- No.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.601
No. I was just, uh, was just gonna say...

35:45.685 --> 35:46.685
What?

35:49.105 --> 35:52.108
Okay, fine you're right.
I was gonna woman-bond.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.112
Cut me some slack.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.739
I never had a mentor.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.199
I hate the word mentor.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.493
Fine...

36:04.412 --> 36:05.788
I won't say anything.

36:08.916 --> 36:09.917
Thank you.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.971
This is Detective Duvall.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.017
<i>Hi, um...</i>

37:09.352 --> 37:11.395
<i>I don't know if you know who I am, uh...</i>

37:12.605 --> 37:13.898
<i>this is Marie Adler.</i>

37:17.693 --> 37:18.903
Marie Adler.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.781
Of course I know who you are.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.155
<i>I hope it's okay that I'm calling.</i>

37:26.285 --> 37:28.371
I got your number from my lawyer.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.291
Yes, of course.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.293
How are you?

37:35.419 --> 37:39.131
I'm okay. I'm, uh...
I'm at the beach, actually.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.720
- Well, that sounds nice.
<i>- Yeah, it is.</i>

37:45.846 --> 37:46.846
Um...

37:47.640 --> 37:50.977
Hey, I just, um...
I... I was calling to say, uh...

37:52.478 --> 37:57.400
to... to thank you for, you know,
everything that you did.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.321
Well, of course.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.034
I'm... I'm so glad we were able to help.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.862
<i>You did...</i>

38:10.579 --> 38:11.579
totally.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.045
You know, the thing is,
I've spent my whole life...

38:18.838 --> 38:23.301
trying really hard to believe
that most people are basically good,

38:23.592 --> 38:25.469
<i>even when the ones I knew weren't.</i>

38:25.886 --> 38:27.513
I don't know, I guess it just...

38:30.349 --> 38:31.767
gave me hope or something.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.144
I can see that.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.815
<i>Then this thing happened. The rape and...</i>

38:38.274 --> 38:40.651
I don't know,
it just became harder for me to...

38:41.444 --> 38:44.780
believe that there was really any good
in the world.

38:44.864 --> 38:48.701
<i>And I think that that was the hardest part
of this whole thing.</i>

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
<i>Waking up feeling hopeless.</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:54.874
And I would think things like, "Well...

38:58.002 --> 39:00.046
if the world is this bad, do I...

39:01.505 --> 39:03.924
do I even wanna be in it?"
You know?

39:08.262 --> 39:09.262
I do.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.934
<i>But then, out of nowhere,</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:15.978
<i>I hear about these two people</i>

39:16.354 --> 39:18.773
in some completely other part
of the country,

39:18.856 --> 39:21.692
looking out for me
and making things right.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.776
And...

39:24.570 --> 39:27.031
I don't know, more than...
more than anything else,

39:28.532 --> 39:30.242
more than him getting locked up...

39:32.244 --> 39:33.579
more than the money I got,

39:34.622 --> 39:35.956
it was hearing that,

39:37.541 --> 39:39.043
about you guys, that

39:39.126 --> 39:40.878
<i>just changed things completely.</i>

39:42.296 --> 39:44.090
<i>And I... I wake up now,</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:45.174
and...

39:48.594 --> 39:50.679
I can imagine good things happening.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.063
I'm... I'm so happy to hear that, Marie.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.566
So, anyway, I just...

40:04.777 --> 40:07.947
wanted you to know that you...
you did that for me...

40:11.325 --> 40:12.618
and to say thank you.

40:14.995 --> 40:15.996
You're welcome.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.877
Thank you for calling.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.629
Yeah, you bet.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.552
Uh, hey, you have a good day, okay?

40:30.928 --> 40:31.928
You too.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.516
Okay.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.393
Bye.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.563
Bye.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.375
<i>I got a call from someone
just now.</i>

41:44.001 --> 41:45.001
Yeah.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.504
Marie Adler.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.299
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

41:50.382 --> 41:53.469
- <i>What'd she say?
- She was calling from the beach.</i>

41:53.552 --> 41:57.389
<i>And she was calling to say
she's doing very well.</i>

41:57.681 --> 42:00.226
And that, uh, she wanted to say...

42:02.269 --> 42:03.312
<i>thank you.</i>
