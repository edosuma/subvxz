Hey, everyone, it's
Princess Love Norwood here.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.719
{\an8}They say good things come
to those who wait

07:33.786 --> 07:35.955
{\an8}and... they were right.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.490
After months
and months of trying,

07:37.557 --> 07:40.893
Ray and I are finally expecting
our first bundle of joy.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.863
{\an6}Hey...

07:40.960 --> 07:43.863
Aw, you look fabulous.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.865
{\an5}Congratulations.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.865
{\an3}Thank you.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.967
Princess and I may have had
our issues in the past,

07:48.034 --> 07:51.971
but we both realize that it's
time to let that pettiness go.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.272
Neither of us
could even remember

07:53.339 --> 07:54.907
what we were beefing about
anyway.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.077
After the clique wars
from last year, we're over it.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.178
How many months are you now?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.713
Um, six and a half.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.248
{\an5}You're still tiny.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.248

08:03.649 --> 08:06.385
{\an5}(Lyrica)
Things are lit
for Miss Lyrica right now.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.888
{\an8}I just got off of my promo tour
for my album, "Adia,"

08:08.955 --> 08:11.991
and the first song that I ever
went to radio with, my single,

08:12.058 --> 08:13.459
"Don't Take It Personal,"
charted.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.294
But right now
I really just wanna kick back

08:15.361 --> 08:17.096

08:17.163 --> 08:19.432
{\an4}Me and you are supposed to be
pregnant at the same time.

buy me a toy or something.

36:20.545 --> 36:21.812
She told me what happened.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.214
I didn't come to her bad.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.682
I feel like she's
very entitled.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.486
I sat there
and waited on my show

36:28.553 --> 36:30.154
for Lyrica to get there.

36:30.221 --> 36:33.591
There are no excuses
in this business.

36:33.658 --> 36:37.361
{\an1}And then you make me a villain
when I'm trying to tell you?

36:37.428 --> 36:39.063
She is spoiled!

36:39.130 --> 36:40.965
She not spoiled.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.701
{\an1}She work very hard for
everything that she got.

36:43.768 --> 36:44.936
You my (bleep) little sister.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.304
You gonna come to my (bleep)

36:46.370 --> 36:48.439
a hour late
on my album release?

36:48.506 --> 36:50.808
You showed me
that you have no respect

36:50.875 --> 36:52.376
for the (bleep) I've done.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.145
(A1)
What have you done, K.?

36:54.211 --> 36:56.581
'Cause this sounds like you
real jealous right now.

36:56.647 --> 36:59.850
Real talk? K. Michelle's
last album just flopped,

36:59.917 --> 37:01.485
and she's with a major label.

37:01.552 --> 37:05.623
She just mad 'cause Lyrica's
independent and on the charts

37:05.690 --> 37:06.891
and K. Michelle ain't.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.693
I came to her
on some real (bleep).

37:08.759 --> 37:09.894
I also said some things

37:09.961 --> 37:12.563
regarding the Safaree
situation.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.433
{\an4}Yeah.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.433
All I have to say
is I ain't gonna lie.

37:15.499 --> 37:18.035
I don't believe that.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.404
{\an1}If she gonna try
to (bleep) somebody,

37:20.471 --> 37:22.139
{\an1}she gonna try
to (bleep) somebody

37:22.206 --> 37:23.407
that's more lit than me.

37:23.474 --> 37:24.875
Just being honest.

37:24.942 --> 37:27.778
It just came
from the sky, hon.

37:27.845 --> 37:32.183
If you like it or not,
I'ma always tell you true.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.085
{\an1}Well, I'm gonna tell you
the truth too.

37:34.151 --> 37:36.654
{\an1}I think
your album is garbage.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.789
{\an1}I think your vocals
is garbage.

37:38.856 --> 37:41.392
{\an5}I think that-- listen--

37:38.856 --> 37:41.392
Well, you're the brother
produced some of 'em.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.161
{\an4}I know, and I,
I couldn't believe it.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.161
I think your wife is not a star.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.664
{\an4}You on some straight bull(bleep)
and I see through that.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.664
Are you reading me clear?

37:46.731 --> 37:47.999
Yes, I am, bro.

37:48.065 --> 37:50.267
{\an1}You never will be
like a Beyoncé or a Rihanna.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.535
{\an5}I didn't want to.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.535
And you're mad at that.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.904
{\an1}The (bleep) industry
ain't (bleep) with you.

37:53.971 --> 37:57.041
Google it-- K. Michelle
is banned from radio

37:57.108 --> 37:58.976

You not even a real producer.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.399
You work under somebody.
