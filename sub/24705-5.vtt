WEBVTT

00:32.991 --> 00:35.410
- Hey, how's it going, Mr. Mac?
- Oh, pretty good.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.414
- How's my brother?
- Hard being a young person nowadays.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.875
Yeah. I know what you mean.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.757
- Hey.
- <i>Hola.</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:57.557
Hey. I guess you're not at work.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.644
Oh, that guy, man, he didn't...
he didn't like me.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.272
Yeah? He liked me.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.191
That's why he gave me the job.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.234
That's why he called me
when he had to fire you.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.946
Where's your TV?

01:14.824 --> 01:17.077
- Stole.
- Stole, huh?

01:17.660 --> 01:20.622
Yeah, it's the building, man.
They're trying to get us outta here.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.708
People been getting robbed.
They turned off the water.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.710
They even stole my couch, man.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.215
You using, Roberto?

01:32.467 --> 01:36.179
I'm usin'. But they took the TV
and my clock radio and the couch.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.890
- Pack your stuff.
- For what?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.225
'Cause you're going into the detox.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.936
I got you in a 60-day program
at Manhattan State.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.105
- I can't do that, Jamie.
- You're going in that program.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.398
Look, I'm trying to tell you
there's something wrong inside of me.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.109
I... I don't think I can ever kick.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.320
- I'm gonna lose this place.
- No, you're not. I'll keep it for you.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.405
- I'll stay here.
- What's going on here?

01:55.031 --> 01:56.658
It's family business.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.537
- Who's that slob?
- The super.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.124
He beat the crap outta me a few times.
They're tryin' to get people outta here.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.792
Pack your things.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.001
Put your things together.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.382
Hey! Come on! I don't like doors
being slammed in my face.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.260
Yeah? My brother told me
what's been going on in this building.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.719
Listen to what I'm sayin' to you.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.680
He's gonna be gone a while,
and I'm moving in.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.723
And that stuff has just stopped happening.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.767
Listen, you little spick piece of garbage.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.436
Don't tell me what's gonna happen.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.773
Hey! You put your hands on me again,
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

02:28.773 --> 02:30.066
And then I'm gonna take you to jail!

02:30.066 --> 02:32.026
Why didn't you show me that
in the first place?

02:32.026 --> 02:33.862
Gotta see a badge before you act
like a human being?

02:33.862 --> 02:37.448
Hey! Hey, kid, look... look.
I'm on the job too.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.788
And I think I just heard your brother
going out the bathroom window.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.795
Roberto! Hey, Roberto!

04:16.381 --> 04:17.757
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.261
I was on my way to work.
I wanted to thank you for the flowers.

04:21.719 --> 04:22.971
Well, they had a special.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.100
The "John Kelly Gets Used To His Ex-wife
Being A Prosecutor" special.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.394
It's important to me to still have you

04:29.394 --> 04:31.396
- for a friend.
- You got that.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.773
I want to be able to tell you
what's going on in my life.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.525
You got that too.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.237
We're not that far away from each other.
Maybe we can have lunch sometimes.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.197
Well, today's not good.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.283
Oh, today I can't.
I'm having lunch with my boss.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.785
All right. You'll take a rain check?

04:46.411 --> 04:49.414
- Yeah.
- Go get 'em, Laurie.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.542
- See you, John.
- Go get 'em.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.751
Yeah.

04:56.504 --> 04:57.797
See ya.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.094
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.097
- : Hey, Kelly.
- Yeah.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.391
- You got a second?
- Sure.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.354
- You gotta help me out here, Detective.
- What's going on, Sarge?

05:13.521 --> 05:16.733
Stillwell. He's taking lunch orders
from my prisoners again.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.068
What, you think that's funny?

05:19.235 --> 05:21.529
You know what happens to these animals
when they don't get their food?

05:21.529 --> 05:23.323
They start biting holes
in each other's necks.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.824
Okay. Let me talk to him, all right?

05:25.241 --> 05:26.492
Thanks.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.248
We can, uh, order anything
we want off of here?

05:32.248 --> 05:35.209
Anything. And we gotta give you
exactly what you want

05:35.209 --> 05:39.380
within 15 minutes of normal mealtime
in order to abide by the consent decree

05:39.505 --> 05:41.424
issued by Judge Baraka.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.470
- So, uh, so what do you guys want?
- I'll have some brisket.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.930
- It's not all dried out, is it?
- Premium cut.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.725
Flash-broiled with...
with a little butter to order.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.228
I'll take that, medium rare,
mashed potatoes,

05:54.228 --> 05:55.772
- French beans and some gravy.
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.899
Good choice.
Detective Stillwell.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.818
Uh, in a minute, Kelly.
I... I gotta finish up here.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.405
Do you want that gravy on the meat
or on the potatoes, or, uh, both?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.742
I want it on the meat, but I don't want it
rolling in the vegetables.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.287
You want it on the side,
in a little carton.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.955
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.750
Uh, Judge says, uh,
if you don't want dessert,

06:16.167 --> 06:20.338
- you gotta so state in front of witnesses.
- No, I want dessert.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.839
Yeah. Yeah.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.593
Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll... I'll catch up
with him later.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.513
All right. I'm saying it nice, Detective,
but I'm saying it.

06:28.638 --> 06:32.100
Either you straighten this asshole out,
or I'm hanging him with the lieutenant.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.684
Okay, got you, Sarge.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.898
- Hey.
- Hey. What's goin' on?

06:38.898 --> 06:41.484
We gotta talk to Stillwell.
He's taking lunch orders again.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.154
Whoa. Excuse me, Kelly.
We don't gotta do anything.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.658
I've had my quota of buzzers,
dribble glasses and fart pillows.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.827
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey, Martinez.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.788
- What's goin' on, kid?
- Not much. Got a minute for me, Detective?

06:53.788 --> 06:55.123
- Yeah, sure.
- So I'll catch you later.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.624
All right. Over here.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.255
- What's up?
- A couple of things, you know.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.132
Some family stuff to deal with,

07:04.674 --> 07:07.427
plus I, uh, got a situation
in regards to another cop.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.096
- What situation?
- He's a bad cop.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.682
He's cleaning tenants out
of a rent-controlled building.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.893
He's robbing people. He's harassing 'em.
He's beatin' 'em up.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.105
- How are you involved?
- He's the super at my brother's building.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.190
I'm staying there a little while.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.652
- The guy was just in my face this morning.
- And he says he's on the job?

07:24.777 --> 07:26.612
Yeah, after I showed him my badge.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.114
Then he gets all friendly,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.241
says don't worry
about the rent being on time.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.660
Starts talking about throwing
a few bucks my way.

07:32.660 --> 07:36.747
Whoa. I'm not gonna tell you
don't bring him up on charges,

07:36.747 --> 07:40.418
but, uh, you gotta know
this is a big step, Martinez.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.795
Yeah. I mean, I...

07:43.129 --> 07:45.548
I didn't join the department
to bust other cops.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.884
That's how people end up
on the rat squad.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.596
All right.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.099
You think you can talk to this guy
man-to-man? What's... what's his name?

07:55.683 --> 07:58.352
- Hanlan. He's out of the 33...
- You think you can talk to him,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.771
- straighten him out?
- Well, maybe I... I could try that.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.773
Because that oughta be your first step.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.193
Yeah.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.696
That's probably what I oughta do. Okay.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.157
- Thanks, Detective.
- Yeah.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.744
- You moved into your brother's place?
- Yeah, I... I might do that...

08:14.869 --> 08:16.204
You never told me what he does.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.455
- Roberto?
- Yeah.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.373
- He's still feeling his way along.
- Yeah.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.459
Still looking for his niche.
You know, so...

08:21.709 --> 08:24.545
Hey, keep me posted
on this other situation.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.798
- I will do, okay? Thanks for the advice.
- Okay.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.929
Yo, Kelly. What do you need?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.723
- You got plans for lunch?
- I can be had.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.267
- Andy and I wanna take you out.
- It's a date.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.608
What are you trying to prove here, John?

08:46.108 --> 08:47.777
You're not going to raise
this guy over again.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.904
You don't think his stuff
is starting to get weirder?

08:50.154 --> 08:51.822
I don't keep real close tabs.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.450
I mean, Stillwell wants to be
a practical joker,

08:54.659 --> 08:56.327
lose his paycheck gambling every week,

08:56.327 --> 08:57.745
that's why they fought
the Revolutionary War.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.288
Hey, guys.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.459
You think
preseason pro basketball's a sucker's bet?

09:03.751 --> 09:06.254
I don't follow it that closely, Art.
We ordered.

09:06.462 --> 09:10.007
I gave mine in the back.
Andy, what are you doing there?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.218
- What?
- We can't take you anywhere.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.637
Whoop.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.972
So what's the occasion?

09:16.138 --> 09:19.392
Uh, it's probably a good idea to stop
taking lunch orders for the holding cell.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.602
Wait a second.
You don't think that's funny?

09:21.727 --> 09:23.646
Yeah. I think you've had a good run
with it.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.897
Well, if you think about it,

09:24.897 --> 09:28.234
uh, you're really asking the sarge
to clean up the mess afterward.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.529
All right. That's a point.
I'll make it right with the sarge.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.865
I'll lighten up on it, huh? Wait.
Earn your tip.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.617
- Jets get seven at the Bills.
- The Bills?

09:36.867 --> 09:39.704
- You're nuts. Jets win on the field.
- Oh, the Bills cover.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.123
Go back to mah-jongg, you hump!

09:42.498 --> 09:45.501
He always unties my shoelaces.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.088
So, uh, how's your love lives? Or wait.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.257
- You done rebuking me?
- That's it.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.718
- Love life's a little slow.
- Ditto.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.886
- How's Lila?
- Good.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.515
- We got a little rocky patch coming up.
- Is that right?

10:00.099 --> 10:03.811
I took out a loan on our pension
on some real estate thing in New Mexico.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.064
Turned out to be bogus.
She doesn't know about it yet.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.027
I don't plan any big sexfest,

10:11.319 --> 10:13.696
- the night we have that little talk.
- How bad was the hit?

10:14.113 --> 10:18.367
- I'd say, uh, all of it. Pretty much all.
- That's rough, Art.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.288
Ah, balls. All's I need's
a 12-team parlay, and I'm square.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.666
Andy, what are they doing here?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.336
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:30.921
Is this some special day
and you didn't tell us about it?

10:31.047 --> 10:35.343
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

10:35.509 --> 10:39.930
<i>Happy birthday dear Detective</i>

10:39.930 --> 10:42.892
It's not really my birthday.
He's just having some fun with me.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.354
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:48.564
Oh, look, we gotta get outta here now.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.859
It was fun, Artie.
Funnier than the last six times.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.824
Happy birthday to you.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.841
You think the old man could've had
a heart attack or a stroke?

11:15.966 --> 11:19.303
Sure, before or after
he fell through the railing?

11:20.054 --> 11:21.222
Let's go.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.936
- Watch your step.
- I told you, Detective.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.189
- I told you this Hanlan was a bad guy.
- Okay, take it easy, Martinez.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.484
That old man kept an eye out
on my brother. He looked out for him.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.779
It's an old building. I guess the railing
could've loosened on its own,

11:36.779 --> 11:39.865
but there's some fresh screwdriver marks
where the brackets were.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.077
The lady over here says
that Mrs. Vicario in 207

11:43.077 --> 11:45.538
suffocated three months ago
from the gas in her stove.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.124
Says that the windows in her apartment
were shut in the middle of July.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.917
She thinks the super did that too.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.711
Did she have any run-ins
with him personally?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.045
No. I asked her that.

11:54.171 --> 11:57.216
- Is your brother around?
- No, not right now.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.635
No point in dustin'. Guy's the super.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.388
I mean fingerprints on the banister
wouldn't prove anything anyway.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.724
I called Hanlan's precinct.
He's doin' a 4-to-12.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.810
I don't wanna talk to him on the job,
so we'll talk to him tomorrow. All right?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.814
He did this. I'm... I'm telling you,
he did this. He's a bad guy!

12:11.939 --> 12:14.984
I hear you, Martinez, and we're gonna do
something about it. Come on.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.919
- Laura! Hey.
- Hey.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.965
Sorry I had to cancel lunch
yesterday, but, uh...

12:37.965 --> 12:39.049
No problem.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.885
Hey, just like law school, huh?

12:40.885 --> 12:43.262
- Junk food on the fly.
- Yeah.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.473
So are you all settled in?
You got your boxes unpacked?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.599
Pretty much.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.310
The assistant D.A.'s area
is a little like Kafka, no?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.687
Yeah, my office is in kind of a long row.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.898
So the group of cases
I'm working started

12:54.023 --> 12:56.108
with a couple of street-level
Dominican drug dealers.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.611
They keep going down like dominoes,
I keep going up.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.280
I'm not two convictions away
from being the top

13:01.572 --> 13:04.909
narcotics prosecutor in the five boroughs,
which means I got 47 other prosecutors

13:04.909 --> 13:07.161
who would love to see me fall on my face.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.832
- I want you to keep me from doing that.
- I'm second seat interviewing witnesses.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.168
You'll pick it right up.
You were always smarter than I was.

13:14.418 --> 13:17.588
And once you get used to the dirty water,
you are going to love the work.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.508
- I can get used to dirty water.
- You see that?

13:21.509 --> 13:23.969
That is U.S. Attorney Goldfarb.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.639
He controls a witness we need.
We're pitching him tomorrow.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.933
You know in my larcenous heart,
I'd like to buy him

13:29.058 --> 13:31.310
a box of those ten-dollar torches
he smokes.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.230
My advice would be, don't do that.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.734
See? You're gonna be essential.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.245
- You John Kelly?
- Yeah.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.288
- Jack Hanlan.
- Hey, Jack. Thanks for comin' in.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.415
- Andy Sipowicz, Jack Hanlan.
- How you doin'?

13:53.415 --> 13:54.708
Come over here, Jack.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.964
- You want coffee, Jack?
- No. No, thanks.

14:00.798 --> 14:04.051
I knew a John Kelly with the 25
when I was coming up.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.221
- That would've been my father.
- And you can be proud of that.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.599
He was a warrior, your old man.
A real old-time bull.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.976
Stand-up all the way.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.437
So you're, uh, working as a super
in this building

14:15.437 --> 14:16.730
where the old man died yesterday?

14:16.981 --> 14:21.151
Yeah. God, you must've been
just a kid when your dad passed.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.695
I was 11.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.073
We'll not see his like again soon.

14:27.908 --> 14:31.078
Well, what... what was it you wanted
to know about the accident, John?

14:31.620 --> 14:35.040
- Well, we looked for you at the building.
- Yeah, I was, uh, working the night tour.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.295
I felt horrible about the old guy falling
through the railing.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.046
Any other problems at that building?

14:41.589 --> 14:46.302
Uh, the usual, a few break-ins,
junkies robbing pensioners on check day.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.263
I smack 'em around a little bit just
to keep 'em in line.

14:49.471 --> 14:53.517
Aside from some vandalism,
uh, there hasn't been much else.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.686
Yeah, well, we heard the landlord
wants the tenants out.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.981
Sure. And he doesn't waste
money on improvements.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.692
But I keep things running
at a basic level.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.652
People move out gradually.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.656
We don't have Dobermans in the hallways,
uh, at night or anything.

15:07.865 --> 15:12.411
- We heard complaints about conditions.
- Would you like to see my to-do list?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.455
It's hell keeping up,
especially the boiler.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.957
That boiler is a bastard.

15:19.668 --> 15:23.714
How about your boiler, Sipowicz?
I heard you took a few shots not long ago.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.132
I get up and down the stairs.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.929
Yeah, these young guys today.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.514
They take a whack like that,
it's instant disability retirement.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.142
Then they spend the rest of their lives
telling everybody,

15:35.142 --> 15:37.353
what a great hero they are,

15:37.478 --> 15:40.064
- like this kid from here I met...
- Martinez.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.486
Yeah, yeah, some name like that.
His brother lives in the building.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.155
He's one of the junkies
I was telling you about.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.406
We had a little run-in.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.206
Well, uh, anything else I can tell you?

15:58.082 --> 15:59.083
That's about it.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.171
Okey-doke, then.
Oh, if you got a free night, Kelly,

16:04.296 --> 16:05.756
uh, let's have a beer.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.843
I'll tell you a few stories about
your old man your mother doesn't know.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.095
Thanks for the offer.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.890
Sure, anytime.
Keep the wind at your back.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.606
- What do you think?
- What do you mean, what do I think?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.067
This lyin' donkey scumbag son of a bitch.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.944
You don't figure your old man
and him would've been runnin' buddies?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.780
My old man wouldn't stand
at the same bar with this guy.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.448
You think he croaked this guy?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.702
You know he did.
And he's gonna walk on it, isn't he?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.247
Come on. We'll run it for the lieutenant.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.379
Joselito, if you see him,
would you call me up?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.339
Please, all right? It's real important.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.177
Poppy, what are you doing here?

16:52.302 --> 16:55.514
Because I want my eyes on you
when I ask you what's going on.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.143
Now, you know your cousin Rosa's kid
is being christened on Sunday?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.854
- Yeah, I'm gonna be there.
- What about your brother?

17:03.313 --> 17:06.066
- I don't know if he can make it.
- I called his place of work.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.070
- They say he's not there anymore.
- The job and him, it wasn't a fit, Poppy.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.032
- I told you, I'm watching you.
- And I'm telling you the truth.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.367
You move out of the house.
You're living at his place.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.119
Your mother's worried,
which is getting to me.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.664
- I wanna know what's going on?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.250
Look, he's your little brother.
You're supposed to take care of him.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.252
I know! I'm trying!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.715
Come here. Come here.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.717
Come here.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.970
Look, if this wasn't your place of work
and your boss over there,

17:35.095 --> 17:36.638
and these other people here, you know,

17:36.764 --> 17:39.349
I'd stand you up against the wall
and knock the crap outta you.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.895
- He's your little brother.
- I'm trying to take care of him.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.189
Now, you tell Mama
he's gonna be all right.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.570
<i>Papi,</i> this is, uh, Detective John Kelly.
This is my father Hector.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.697
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.576
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.789
Got a christening on Sunday.
He gets all worked up.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.793
- Lieutenant wants to see you.
- All right.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.130
Yeah, I'll call you right back.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.884
You asked to be kept apprised

18:14.009 --> 18:15.427
on this incident
at your brother's building.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.887
Yes, sir.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.223
Well, Kelly and Sipowicz
both think you're right.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.642
The cop who's the super is no good.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.312
They both think he's probably responsible
for what happened to that old man,

18:25.771 --> 18:27.147
but he's covered.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.983
There's no witnesses,
no conclusive physical evidence.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.152
Then I want to go forward
on the other stuff.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.529
What do you mean?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.657
I want to notify Internal Affairs
on what this guy's been doing,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.910
the bribe he offered me,
how he beat my brother.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.620
You sure you want to do this?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.957
Yeah. I know this is a big step.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.086
Detective Kelly and I talked
about it before. I want to do it.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.590
Uh, I...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.969
I know a guy in I.A.D.
Let me reach out to him.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.171
Detective John Kelly.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.757
I, uh, I called your office.
They said you still come out here.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.178
Give myself a recital here,
three, four times a week.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.599
How you doin', Kevin? How's Karen?

19:43.932 --> 19:47.644
She got a little gray,
few lines around her eyes. I like it.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.980
- Kids?
- Eh.

19:50.772 --> 19:54.568
Terry's, uh, going to St. Malachi's now,
doing good. Brian's 14.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.614
All he can think about is just
what you'd expect him to, plus football.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.036
- What happened with you?
- You remember Laurie?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.621
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- The girl I was seeing?

20:06.330 --> 20:09.541
- Yeah, I married her.
- Is that so? I liked her.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.045
Yeah, we, uh... we, uh... we split up
a couple of months ago. You know.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.839
Sorry to hear it.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.217
So, John...

20:19.843 --> 20:23.764
you here to renew our big friendship,
or did you maybe want something?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.821
We got a bad cop, Kevin.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.325
A young guy I work with,
James Martinez, wants to bust him.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.328
- I was hoping you could handle the case.
- That's what I do.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.748
He's going to get a lot of exposure
when you guys make the collar.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.542
So you want to know,
can we keep him low-profile...

20:54.211 --> 20:56.922
so he doesn't spend the rest of his career
quarantined in I.A.D.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.800
with a bunch of craphouse rats
and snitches such as myself?

20:59.925 --> 21:03.512
- I never passed judgment on you.
- Yeah. Look how close we stayed.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.723
That was you. You put in for I.A.D.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.517
And you weren't more comfortable
with that, right?

21:08.517 --> 21:10.727
For having to hang around with a cop
who popped a fellow officer.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.189
Didn't you do what you
thought was right? Didn't you?

21:14.314 --> 21:16.775
You're damn right!
And I'd do the same thing today.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.152
I know that.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.115
I didn't come out here
to dig all this up again.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.952
You want to know
can I help your friend Martinez.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.251
I can keep his name out of the papers
until the trial.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.545
Then if this bad cop pleads out,

21:36.712 --> 21:38.630
Martinez' name may not get published
at all.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.549
I'd appreciate that.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.555
Then no one would know
what he did except, of course,

21:46.555 --> 21:49.141
everyone in the department
this bad cop talks to.

21:49.725 --> 21:53.770
and tells them how this lousy
rat snitch spick Martinez

21:53.895 --> 21:55.856
out of the 15 Precinct set him up.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.321
Excuse me, Kelly.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.349
I have two dead heroin dealers,
the Colon brothers,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.684
both taken out by Agosto Reyes.

22:32.809 --> 22:36.772
This Reyes put $100,000 worth of smack
on the street every month.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.441
Your protected witness was his supplier.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.778
For security purposes,
we're calling our witness the Roach.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.155
- The Roach?
- Yes.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.325
Well, this guy
I'm trying to put away, Reyes,

22:48.492 --> 22:53.413
probably had conversations with the Roach
regarding these murders.

22:53.538 --> 22:57.667
Everybody's asking for the Roach,
Hartford, Atlantic City, everybody.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.462
How essential is the Roach's
testimony to your case?

23:00.796 --> 23:02.005
It would make it bulletproof.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.675
We'd only need a couple days'
interrogation and prep,

23:05.675 --> 23:07.552
then maybe one day of testimony.

23:07.928 --> 23:12.140
We're prepared to be fully flexible
regarding any of the demands on his time.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.935
That's a precondition of access
to this witness.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.686
I'll also see that
the U.S. Attorney's office

23:17.145 --> 23:20.023
is lavishly credited
for facilitating this prosecution.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.693
Thanks for the kiss,
but what you just offered so generously,

23:23.819 --> 23:26.071
that's also a precondition of access
to this witness.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.407
Would you mind waiting
outside a minute, please?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.205
It looks like it's just finishing up...

23:38.959 --> 23:40.752
So how do you think I did in there?

23:41.044 --> 23:44.089
You were good. You don't think so?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.758
If we get the Roach, I think so.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.303
Can you tell me who gave him the stupid
code name like the Roach?

23:50.762 --> 23:51.972
I did.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.143
If you'll step back in,
we can start working out your access.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.278
Here's the 1606.
Take these back, all right?

24:06.403 --> 24:10.031
I just missed the Brooklyn
number 427. I had 815.

24:10.198 --> 24:13.994
- What do you want, Stillwell?
- Sarge, I owe you an apology.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.081
Uh, I went a little
overboard on that food gag,

24:18.081 --> 24:21.751
and I just want to say it's <i>finito.</i>
End of story.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.338
Yeah? Well, I was this near
to taking you to the lieutenant.

24:25.338 --> 24:28.633
And I appreciate that you didn't. Square?

24:29.676 --> 24:32.721
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Sarge.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.394
Do you have anyone who can corroborate
the incidents you've alleged?

24:39.644 --> 24:42.063
One 80-year-old guy who could have
done it is dead.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.816
You said your brother
was also a victim of harassment.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.318
Would he be available
to give a statement?

24:46.902 --> 24:49.279
- Ev... eventually, yeah, yeah.
- What does that mean?

24:49.946 --> 24:53.074
Well, he's not available.
I mean, I'm... I'm not sure where he is.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.536
We have no case
unless we can get Hanlan on record.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.748
- How do you feel about wearing a wire?
- I don't want to.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.833
Then we can't proceed.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.836
I said I don't want to.
I didn't say I wouldn't.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.509
This guy made an old man die.
He probably killed an old woman too.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.845
He abused my brother.
I don't want to, but...

25:15.138 --> 25:18.266
if it takes wearing a wire to pop
this guy, then that's what I'm gonna do.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.618
Oh, man, that's the gear.
They're gonna put a wire on the kid.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.496
- This is no good.
- He's a big boy, John.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.873
Mm-mm, no good.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.178
How about we hold off on this?
Let me talk to the guy.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.763
This isn't your problem, Detective.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.724
Martinez, Hanlan wants to drink with me,
piss in my ear a little bit.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.393
Maybe I can get him to talk
about the old man.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.770
- Will you wear a wire?
- No.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.273
But if I can get him to cop to the crime,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.608
maybe I can figure out a way
to make it stand up in court.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.403
Do it.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.916
You don't have to go on this, you know.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.835
You're not planning
to kill this guy, are you?

26:27.502 --> 26:29.421
- No.
- Who's driving?

26:31.172 --> 26:33.842
- Hey, Sipowicz, Kelly, check this out.
- Yeah?

26:33.842 --> 26:37.012
It'll just take a second.
You gotta hear this. Go on, pal.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.014
Tell these detectives
what you just told me.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.310
Well, uh, I was waiting at a bus stop

26:43.310 --> 26:45.937
when these two women
offered me a lift home.

26:46.354 --> 26:51.901
They were young, attractive,
very friendly, so naturally I accepted.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.236
Go on. Then what?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.531
They drove down
under the Westside Highway,

26:56.990 --> 26:58.283
and they parked there and...

26:59.826 --> 27:02.704
ordered me to remove my clothes
at gunpoint.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.373
At gunpoint.
You're not gonna believe this. Tell 'em.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.208
I was humiliated.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.880
They forced me to...
you know, pleasure one of them.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.965
And? And, and?

27:15.175 --> 27:18.803
I experienced an unwanted emission.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.056
This being the first of several
unwanted emissions,

27:21.181 --> 27:24.643
intimidated out of this...
this rampant bull of a man.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.103
Hey, Stillwell, don't you think you ought
to take this kind of complaint

27:27.103 --> 27:29.314
- in the interview room?
- The interview room?

27:29.314 --> 27:30.398
- Yeah.
- Nobody'd believe me

27:30.398 --> 27:32.901
if I came out with a story like this.
Skip to the next emission.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.819
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to.

27:35.862 --> 27:39.741
Okay, so now the other one orders me
to do the same to her,

27:39.949 --> 27:41.534
you know, the sexual thing.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.620
And he's coerced out of yet
another emission.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.206
- Uh, we gotta go. Um...
- Do you believe this guy?

27:46.331 --> 27:49.042
He's got so many emissions,
he's gonna need a smog certificate!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.961
You bagger! You're 60 years old!

27:52.128 --> 27:53.630
Your butt hangs down
the back of your knees!

27:54.214 --> 27:56.341
You oughta throw yourself
on the floor and thank God...

27:56.341 --> 27:58.093
you can make up stories like this!

27:58.510 --> 27:59.928
I'm not gonna take this!

28:00.053 --> 28:01.971
- I'm getting outta here!
- Hey! Wait a second.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.473
- Hey, Art.
- Whe... where you going?

28:03.473 --> 28:04.599
- Hey, hey!
- Art, stop.

28:04.599 --> 28:08.687
Hey! Hey, I want you to show these cops
the abused organ in question!

28:08.687 --> 28:12.982
Come back here and lay out that
awesome wood right here on my desk!

28:24.285 --> 28:26.371
You should see your guys'...

28:26.705 --> 28:29.666
If this isn't the Last Supper...

28:29.874 --> 28:33.086
Hey! Hey, it's a joke.
I hired the guy.

28:33.336 --> 28:37.882
Oh, you should see your faces.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.385
My last 180 bucks!

28:40.510 --> 28:42.053
I cleaned out the account,
but it was worth it!

28:42.595 --> 28:45.598
Oh, I lost urine, it was so funny!

28:45.724 --> 28:49.644
I'm tellin' ya, I gotta go
change my shorts. Whoo!

28:49.894 --> 28:52.230
Art. Art. Art.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.690
Hey. Hey.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.401
- How's it goin', Lieutenant?
- It's okay. How you doin'?

28:56.609 --> 28:58.403
- Fine.
- You wanna step in my office?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.655
- Hey, Lieutenant...
- No, come on, come on.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.491
Come on, come on, Lieuten... Lieutenant.
We're just having some fun here.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.826
That isn't what I saw, Art.

29:05.076 --> 29:09.581
W... well,
you think it got a little too out of line?

29:10.623 --> 29:13.543
Art, I want you to give me your gun.

29:14.377 --> 29:18.298
- What are you talking about? Why?
- Because I think it's a good idea.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.011
Why? You gonna take me
to the puzzle house?

29:23.595 --> 29:26.014
- Gonna take me to Psych Services?
- That's right.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.309
Come on. Lieutenant.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.978
Come on, Art. Give me the gun.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.110
All right, let's go.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.823
We're off to see the wizard.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.226
Hanlan, you in there?

30:11.559 --> 30:14.103
- Who needs me?
- It's John Kelly, Jack.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.939
I called your precinct.
They said you were off.

30:16.523 --> 30:21.027
So, figured maybe you'd find me here, huh?
Excellent police work.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.571
- Can I offer you a little liquor drink?
- Sure.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.906
Now come on in.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.619
What are you looking for, John?

30:30.036 --> 30:33.331
- You want to hear about your father?
- I'd like that.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.502
Well, he might have made
chief of detectives if he hadn't got shot.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.382
You wanna know why?
Because he knew the job.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.886
Not the manual, the job. Sit down.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.432
Back then, we had an Irish department.
Oh, we had some guineas.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.561
We had Jews. We had a few niggers,
but it was an Irish department.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.354
And this city was liveable.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.566
Harlem, before the '64 riots,
you could walk down the street.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.318
You could do your shopping.
You could talk to the spades like people.

31:02.318 --> 31:05.280
They even treated each other
like human beings.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.615
You're a young guy, Kelly.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.369
You grew up in a different department
in a different city.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.414
You probably think I'm a racist.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.584
I think you're a lousy bartender.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.337
I'm trying to paint a picture
for you of this city,

31:22.463 --> 31:24.716
the department your old man was part of.

31:26.217 --> 31:30.221
He, uh, he set a standard for himself
and for the people on the street.

31:30.638 --> 31:34.976
Every scumbag criminal out there
knew there was a line.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.146
And if he crossed it, he was in trouble.
Not too many crossed it.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.939
And if they did, they never did it twice.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.985
How did it feel
living in the perfect society, Jack?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.613
It's all right. Joke around.

31:47.071 --> 31:51.200
But if some skell raped an old lady,
he might find himself thrown off a roof.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.828
That was called
officer discretion back then.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.247
My old man ever throw
anybody off a building?

31:57.290 --> 32:00.710
I wouldn't know. That's not the point
that I'm trying to make.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.254
What was it like to work with him?

32:04.714 --> 32:08.301
I only saw him at the crime scenes.
We never worked one-on-one.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.886
I was on patrol. He was a detective.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.805
But everybody knew
what kind of a guy he was.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.808
I thought you were buddies.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.227
I said I knew him. We all knew him.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.523
We knew we could count on each other.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.658
I got a problem, and I don't know
what to do about it.

32:32.825 --> 32:33.993
What do you mean?

32:34.118 --> 32:36.579
I think you did something
to the old man upstairs.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.582
What are you talking about?
That old guy fell. That was an accident.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.793
Nails were pulled,
fresh screwdriver marks.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.671
Your prints were all over that banister.
That's a makable case, Jack.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.506
Come on, you're a better detective
than that.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.676
If they lifted one print
off that banister, they lifted 50.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.971
Other tenants described
a pattern of harassment.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.599
The old man is dead.
What am I gonna do about this?

32:57.850 --> 32:59.185
You wanna know what you can do about it?

32:59.185 --> 33:01.437
Have another drink, go home
and put it out of your mind.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.398
I can't do that. I know what I know.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.818
What is this, Kelly? Is this a shakedown?
You want money to make this go away?

33:06.818 --> 33:10.488
- You offering me money?
- For what? I haven't done anything wrong!

33:20.957 --> 33:24.085
- What kind of money are we talking about?
- How much is it worth to you?

33:25.461 --> 33:28.047
Well, I think I can see my way clear

33:28.172 --> 33:30.258
to a thousand dollars,
something like that.

33:30.633 --> 33:33.928
- You did it, didn't ya?
- I did nothin'! The old man fell!

33:33.928 --> 33:35.763
Nobody feels worse about it than I do!

33:35.763 --> 33:38.599
You didn't do it, but you're offering me
a thousand dollars.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.185
Look, you can make this thing go away.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.981
I can't change what happened.
I wish I could.

33:44.981 --> 33:48.401
- It makes me sick. It keeps me awake.
- It should.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.739
No! You don't get to point
your finger at me!

33:52.947 --> 33:56.200
You don't get to judge another man's life,
or what he had to do!

33:56.325 --> 33:58.661
We're talking about pushing
an old man through a railing.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.330
- He wasn't pushed! He fell!
- You loosened it.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.125
I do what I have to do
to make a life!

34:04.125 --> 34:06.878
Hmm, and an old man had to die over it?
Jack, come on.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.547
This is John Kelly's son.
Make me understand.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.301
Look, I'm 56 years old!
Nobody's looking out for me!

34:13.301 --> 34:17.722
These people here, they give me $600
under the table and a place to stay!

34:17.972 --> 34:20.767
- That doesn't let you off the hook.
- Wh... what do you want, Kelly?

34:20.767 --> 34:22.018
You want 2,500?

34:22.143 --> 34:24.562
- I want you to tell me you did it.
- All right!

34:24.687 --> 34:27.648
I pulled nails! I loosened the banister!

34:28.983 --> 34:31.569
And if it ever gets back to me,
I'll deny I ever said it.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.907
Ah, nobody wanted the old guy to die.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.911
Nobody... nobody feels worse
about it than me.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.920
Are we all right now?

34:59.013 --> 35:00.306
Yeah.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.976
Give me a day to get the money.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.687
Forget the money.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.107
It's not about the money.

35:11.192 --> 35:15.238
I know this is a lot for you to bury,
but in my heart I know

35:15.238 --> 35:18.741
I would do the same thing for you,
John Kelly's son.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.954
Your hand, John?

35:29.252 --> 35:30.586
That's it.

35:32.421 --> 35:35.174
You did the right thing.
Your old man would be proud of ya.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.427
- He would've understood.
- I think he would.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.846
I know he would.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.683
I know he would!

35:59.949 --> 36:00.992
How'd you do?

36:02.201 --> 36:05.872
Got him. Now take me home before I puke.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.599
Hey, Kelly!
When are you goin' over to these guys?

36:24.724 --> 36:27.935
When are you gonna find
your right home at I.A.D.?

36:28.144 --> 36:31.856
At least they admit they're snitches.
They don't sit and drink with you

36:31.856 --> 36:34.275
and then rat on you!

36:34.483 --> 36:36.694
You're a lousy stool pigeon,
a convent snitch,

36:36.861 --> 36:38.946
and you pissed all over
your father's gravestone!

36:39.071 --> 36:41.949
Don't mention my father's name again,
you murdering son of a bitch.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.702
- This would make him sick!
- Shut up, Hanlan.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.246
Get him upstairs.

36:47.830 --> 36:52.084
Everybody in the department's gotta know
what a pissy little schoolgirl you are!

36:52.251 --> 36:54.921
Get up those stairs, Hanlan.
You're making a fool of yourself.

36:55.087 --> 36:57.256
We'll see who's the fool, Kelly!

37:02.887 --> 37:04.305
I gotta see some paperwork.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.141
All right. All right.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.687
Alphonse Giardella?
I'm James Craig. This is Laura Michaels.

37:11.938 --> 37:16.275
Mr. Craig, Ms. Michaels.
I arranged for some refreshments.

37:16.567 --> 37:21.489
Oysters. Very sensual.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.116
You spilled some juice on your shirt.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.786
Oh. I'm nuts.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.248
I knew I should've had
the fried calamari. Oh, I'm sorry.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.916
Uh, sit down. Sit down.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.003
I'll be right with you.
I just gotta make a quick change.

37:38.130 --> 37:42.385
Punks, weaklings, ass bandits,
they all worship success.

37:42.718 --> 37:46.055
But something else, Mr. Craig,
they root for failure.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.849
Figure it out, huh?
I guess you know.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.269
You got a lot of people on your own side
rooting for you.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.480
- Well, I'm gonna win my cases.
- He's got a "screw you" attitude,

37:54.605 --> 37:56.691
your boss, just like me.

37:56.691 --> 38:00.069
I want you to start with your relationship
with the Dominican, Agosto Reyes.

38:00.486 --> 38:03.030
I don't have relationships
with knuckle bouncers.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.825
I dealt some smack to the 'yom is all.

38:06.784 --> 38:10.538
He used maybe four keys a month,
maybe three, four percent of my pie.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.083
He ever mentioned his dealings with Jesus
and Rigoberto Colon to you?

38:14.083 --> 38:18.129
One month he picks up his four keys,
comes back four days later.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.923
I say, "Nice work, Reyes.
Quick turnaround."

38:21.299 --> 38:23.634
Reyes tells me it's not like that at all.

38:24.343 --> 38:27.471
He says he fronted these Colon brothers
the whole four keys,

38:27.471 --> 38:30.391
and they come back with a story
about being ripped off.

38:30.516 --> 38:35.104
At this point Agosto Reyes tells me,
he becomes very indignant on my behalf.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.982
He says, "I whacked both
those sons of bitches."

38:38.107 --> 38:41.819
Those were his exact words,
"I whacked both the sons of bitches"?

38:41.944 --> 38:45.364
Yeah, yeah, his exact words.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.782
What was your response?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.285
What do I care about his story?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.246
He gets taken off, that's his problem.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.957
He whacks the Colon brothers,
that's his problem.

38:55.541 --> 38:59.086
Okay, Mr. Giardella,
that's going to be very helpful.

39:00.504 --> 39:04.800
You know, Agosto Reyes...
...was only one of my people.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.262
I got a lot of others.
You got about half of 'em in your jail.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.224
Those cases belong to other prosecutors,
other jurisdiction.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.976
Yeah, but I like working with you.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.104
I feel very comfortable and at my ease.

39:17.563 --> 39:21.192
Not to mention you're the most attractive
D.A. I've seen in my life.

39:22.902 --> 39:26.155
You know, there's trust that comes
with a continual relationship.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.242
Maybe I could tell the U.S. Attorney
it's my preference

39:30.451 --> 39:32.578
to deal with you people.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.832
But what I know, you could be
in a position here, Mr. Craig.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.638
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.767
Hey, uh, I appreciate
what you did, Detective.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.229
- No problem, Martinez.
- Nah, I know what you did for me.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.523
What's goin' on
with your brother?

40:02.274 --> 40:03.943
I can't talk to you about that.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.947
Come here. You can talk to me.
Come here.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.879
He's got, uh,
a substance abuse problem.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.591
- What kind?
- Narcotics, you know. Heroin.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.804
He's my little brother.
I'm... I'm supposed to take care of him,

40:32.096 --> 40:33.514
and I don't know what to do.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.562
When we were kids,
we were at Yankee Stadium,

40:39.728 --> 40:41.981
the day Reggie hit three home runs
in the same game.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.025
Did you know Martinez is
Reggie Jackson's middle name?

40:45.609 --> 40:46.861
No.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.071
We cut up a piece of grass.

40:50.322 --> 40:52.908
He's still got that. He takes care of it.

40:55.744 --> 40:59.039
I know he's not gone.
The dope hasn't eaten him up yet.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.917
Don't be afraid to reach out to him.

41:02.543 --> 41:06.172
You read all that stuff about tough love,
you know, letting 'em hit rock bottom?

41:07.882 --> 41:10.176
Don't be afraid to reach out to him.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.095
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.931
I wish I could be more helpful than that.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.350
You helped me plenty, Detective.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.186
Really.

41:22.354 --> 41:23.606
Thanks again.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.373
Hey, John, uh, could I talk
to you for a minute?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.001
Sure.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.879
Uh, this thing with the, uh, bad cop,

41:47.004 --> 41:51.425
uh, it's, uh, it's...
it's not exactly sittin' right.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.135
Let's talk about it.

41:53.260 --> 41:56.555
I mean, not... not that he shouldn't have
been brought in, but, uh, I mean,

41:56.555 --> 41:58.933
we're not I.A.D., you know?

42:00.434 --> 42:01.852
Anyway, um,

42:02.061 --> 42:05.189
if you'd like to say something
that might help, I wanna listen.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.442
You'll listen, Medavoy, huh?
You come up, clearing your throat,

42:08.734 --> 42:10.694
like a senator, saying you'll listen?

42:11.070 --> 42:13.030
- He doesn't have to say dick to you.
- Andy.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.534
The cop Kelly put away
killed an 80-year-old man.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.786
He let him fall through a balcony
and break his neck.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.538
- He croaked another lady...
- Andy, come on.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.207
...suffocated her with gas for money
to clear out an apartment building.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.960
I said I wanted to listen!
I... I... I wanted to listen.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.379
Kelly stood in for a kid
with two years on the job

42:28.504 --> 42:30.005
who was gonna have to wear a wire,

42:30.256 --> 42:32.091
and that would've put that kid
on the rat squad.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.926
Kelly did the right thing.

42:34.051 --> 42:37.388
And if you or any other one of you guys
got a problem with that,

42:37.388 --> 42:39.265
you can see me in the parking lot
right now.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.350
- You took me all wrong!
- Andy, that's enough.

42:41.350 --> 42:44.436
You... you never give me a chance
to... to... to explain what I'm saying.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.563
Medavoy, hold it.

42:46.772 --> 42:50.401
Look I understand what you were trying
to say, okay? And I appreciate the offer.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.903
How about pizza and beer
any night this week?

42:53.070 --> 42:55.531
- How about tomorrow night?
- My kid's got a piano recital tonight.

42:55.698 --> 43:00.286
Fine. Pass the word, I'm buying.
Anybody who wants to come can come. Okay?

43:01.495 --> 43:02.580
Fair enough.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.002
Come on.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.215
- Hey, Martinez.
- Hey, Sarge.

43:15.092 --> 43:18.012
There's a kid downstairs,
got pinched in a drug bust.

43:18.178 --> 43:19.555
He says he's your brother.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.892
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do,
huh, Sarge?

43:24.518 --> 43:28.480
He wasn't holding. It's a loitering beef.
I could walk him out the back door.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.527
I'll hold him till the shift's over.
I'll pick him up.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.487
Thanks, Sarge.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.471
What's this?
What you stoppin' here for?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.390
I wanna talk to you about Roberto, man.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.225
Yeah, well, this is a hospital.

44:05.351 --> 44:07.686
I mean, did something happen to him?
Is he hurt?

44:08.103 --> 44:09.772
I mean what's... what's happening?
What's going on?

44:10.064 --> 44:11.315
He's sick, <i>Papi.</i>

44:12.608 --> 44:14.652
He's in the chemical dependency unit.

44:17.529 --> 44:20.282
What the hell is
a chemical dependency unit?

44:20.824 --> 44:23.535
It's where they help people
addicted to drugs.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.455
- Well, you go in.
<i>- Papi.</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:29.458
Look, I don't like junkies,
I don't wanna see a junkie...

44:29.708 --> 44:31.919
Roberto is sick, <i>Papi,</i> and he needs us!

44:32.086 --> 44:34.755
No, no, he's a junkie.
You understand that?

44:34.922 --> 44:37.174
And junkies don't get better.
You got it?

44:40.886 --> 44:44.014
- Okay, <i>Papi,</i> I'll go in.
- Yeah, you go in.

44:44.139 --> 44:45.766
- I'll see him.
- Yeah, you'll see him.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.059
You can wait here, okay?

44:47.267 --> 44:49.144
When I come back out,
then we can drive away.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.604
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

44:57.820 --> 44:59.071
Damn!

45:09.873 --> 45:11.083
James!

45:11.583 --> 45:12.918
James, wait.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.968
We'll do it together, okay?
It's better.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.970
Okay.

45:37.776 --> 45:39.403
How are they treatin' the kid?

45:40.446 --> 45:42.573
- It's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

45:43.699 --> 45:44.950
I'm thinking, Kelly...

45:46.034 --> 45:47.661
I'm thinking maybe there's been
a little progress

45:47.661 --> 45:49.538
in the police department after all.

45:51.290 --> 45:55.085
I remember 15 years ago
a rookie cop walks into a D.O.A. scene,

45:55.502 --> 45:57.296
sees his partner taking money
off a dead person

45:57.421 --> 45:58.922
and putting it into his pocket.

45:59.673 --> 46:02.092
And for giving him up,
this rookie is hung out to dry

46:02.092 --> 46:03.552
by every cop on the job.

46:06.096 --> 46:08.182
You can see how nice it was for me...

46:09.349 --> 46:11.185
watching you bust your ass
for that kid.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.522
I wish it could have been
different for you, Kevin.

46:19.985 --> 46:22.529
- You still go to the Emerald Society?
- No.

46:22.988 --> 46:25.866
- No, I can't drink like that anymore.
- I don't go.

46:26.158 --> 46:27.576
No one will talk to me.

46:27.743 --> 46:31.038
They're all afraid they'll get drunk,
confess their sins and I'll arrest them.

46:33.081 --> 46:35.751
You know, I don't care
about no one talking to me.

46:36.084 --> 46:38.462
I knew that would happen
when I busted that cop.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.758
But I always wanted to play
in the Emerald Society Piper's Band,

46:42.758 --> 46:45.677
and not one of those bastards
will recommend me.

46:46.345 --> 46:48.722
I'm the best piper in the department,
and nobody knows it

46:48.722 --> 46:50.349
except a bunch
of croakers.

46:58.398 --> 47:01.401
- You know what "Piobracht" is, Kelly?
- No.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.989
Well, listen.

47:07.115 --> 47:08.909
This is called "Piobracht."
