03:52.533 --> 03:53.699
- Starting
from the beginning

03:53.701 --> 03:54.900
I wanted to use
different sounds,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.569
so I started recording
my own drum sounds

03:57.571 --> 04:00.806
because anything can be
turned into anything.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.408
Producers use synths
and most of them

04:03.410 --> 04:07.312
come from software
that have stock synths.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.449
Everyone ends up
using the same sounds.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.918
You can always say that
songs have the same melody

04:12.920 --> 04:12.918
or chord progressions,
that's never been a

04:12.920 --> 04:16.688
problem for me because
that's pop music in general.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.324
But the fact that people use
the same instrument patch

04:19.326 --> 04:21.994
every time, has
always frustrated me.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.597
There's no studio fees, i
don't have to pay for anything

04:25.599 --> 04:28.300
when I make any song,
regardless of whether it's

04:28.302 --> 04:30.969
a throwaway beat I just
throw on soundcloud,

04:30.971 --> 04:33.805
or if I give it to the roots.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.980
I'm going by like
the oldest piano.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.950
And also I want the
most expensive piano.

04:44.952 --> 04:44.950
- Hm-mmm.

04:44.952 --> 04:49.054
- The most expensive one i
could find is 90,000 dollars.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.555
- Why is it 90,000 dollars?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.758
- Well cause it's...

04:53.059 --> 04:53.058
- Does it sound the best?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.395
- It's going to sound
as good as any other,

04:56.397 --> 04:58.897
like my free piano.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.299
But...

05:00.301 --> 05:01.066
- You just want the
novelty of the expensive

05:01.068 --> 05:01.800
- yeah.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.734
- Okay.

05:02.736 --> 05:02.734
- Hi, my name's Nick.

05:02.736 --> 05:08.707
I'm interested in the steinway
concert grand piano model d

05:08.709 --> 05:10.842
you guys are advertising
on craigslist.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.411
- Sure. Are
you a pianist yourself?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.845
Or should I have
get somebody who can

05:13.847 --> 05:15.947
play it for you and
that kind of thing?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.883
- Yeah, I know, i
know how to use one.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.718
- Tell me
what this studio is.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.420
- It hasn't been founded yet.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.655
That's why we're
shopping around.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.359
We have a budget for
instruments and stuff.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.961
- You have a budget
for a concert grand piano?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.897
- Yeah, for sure.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.532
How'd I do?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.400
Convincing him?

05:49.682 --> 05:52.984
Music is totally changing
and people need to understand

05:52.986 --> 05:55.053
that instruments are cool

05:55.055 --> 05:57.456
and I definitely mess
with them and I love them

05:57.458 --> 05:59.391
and they're cool to practice on,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.927
but they're novelties.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.373
The entire universe is full
of sound, big and small.

06:14.375 --> 06:18.143
So all of these things that
we record can be anything.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.084
- You said it's for your boss?

06:26.086 --> 06:26.084
- Say that again?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.754
We're checking it
out for him, yeah.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.122
- Oh, what does he do?

06:30.124 --> 06:31.590
- He's opening a studio.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.458
Downtown.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.092
- A recording studio?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.026
- Yeah.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.061
- I see.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.429
- And we need a

06:37.431 --> 06:39.531
a really nice centerpiece.

06:43.669 --> 06:44.836
- What's his name?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.638
- John.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.765
Most instruments were just
vehicles to communicate

07:13.767 --> 07:17.135
a melody in the
loudest way possible.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.037
All that changed
with amplification

07:19.039 --> 07:21.506
and recorded sound.

07:21.508 --> 07:25.076
And so for the first 100 years
of the recording industry,

07:25.078 --> 07:27.145
people were like, oh well
we can record all these

07:27.147 --> 07:29.915
instruments that we've
had for centuries,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.551
and then we can listen
to it anywhere else.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.121
But why do we need those
instruments anymore?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.082
The first instrument,
a drum, was made,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.618
just because it was the
loudest way to communicate.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.020
In Africa they used to
communicate between villages

08:09.022 --> 08:10.956
and signal each
other with drums,

08:10.958 --> 08:13.892
but there's no point
to them anymore.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.063
- Don't let
questlove hear that.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.086
- This one's a bit faster but...

09:00.706 --> 09:02.641
This is the one I worked on,

09:02.643 --> 09:05.944
I started this last night, um...

09:06.879 --> 09:10.215
It's kinda crazy on
the drums though.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.689
I mean it's crazy with
all the different drums

09:17.691 --> 09:18.690
in the background.

09:18.692 --> 09:18.690
- Yeah, no I like that.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.692
- It might be too
cluttered to rap over.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.826
- No I think I could.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.128
I kinda like that one.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.030
Or the dots one.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.765
I would rap on that
if you wanted to add

09:26.767 --> 09:26.765
more to it later or whatever.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.168
- Yeah. That's probably what
i would do is clean it up.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.072
Hello, hello.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.341
All right, here we go.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.709
- Whad up?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.678
- And then you can
play these keys.

09:40.346 --> 09:43.782
- That's amazing.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.219
- You can go in
whenever you want.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.156
- Peep the
sensualidad of my ambiance

09:51.158 --> 09:54.326
gravitas from the
top to the Adidas

09:54.328 --> 09:56.995
try to photocopy the photograph

09:56.997 --> 09:58.063
you don't know the half

09:58.065 --> 09:59.097
don't go to the path

09:59.099 --> 10:00.732
if you don't know the math

10:00.734 --> 10:03.368
sometimes I sniff powders
that folded my soul in half

10:03.370 --> 10:06.037
- and laugh as
i sip from a golden flask

10:06.039 --> 10:08.707
gravitas from the
top to the Adidas

10:08.709 --> 10:09.975
you don't know the half

10:09.977 --> 10:12.277
don't go the path if
you don't know the math

10:12.279 --> 10:14.746
a stolen pathfinder
sipping grass

10:14.748 --> 10:17.182
trying to reach behind the
ass and touch the vagina

10:17.184 --> 10:18.783
my bad, I'm clowning, son

10:18.785 --> 10:20.986
take problems and
drown then in rum

10:20.988 --> 10:22.120
- that sounds cool

10:22.122 --> 10:23.788
- yeah.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.070
- When I listen to
my songs I just remember

10:39.072 --> 10:41.106
being there, the same
way a photo will help you

10:41.108 --> 10:44.042
remember where you were
when you took that photo.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.912
You can take a stock
synth and play with knobs

10:47.914 --> 10:50.348
and tweak it, but you
can't replicate drums

10:50.350 --> 10:53.752
that I recorded in times
square at 2 A.M. when

10:53.754 --> 10:56.154
a cab was honking and
someone was throwing up

10:56.156 --> 10:57.389
10 feet away from me.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.424
It's going to sound
like nothing else.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.825
¶ Kool so singer,
too big to fail

11:00.827 --> 11:03.128
¶ oceanic, I'm shamu,
the killer whale

11:03.130 --> 11:06.798
¶ marine world, splash
splash splash I'm a dolphin

11:06.800 --> 11:09.934
¶ big and 'pac mixed in a
cauldrom with Leonard maltin

11:09.936 --> 11:12.671
¶ not, it don't halt

11:12.673 --> 11:14.906
¶ man, fuck with three
women like Robert Altman

11:14.908 --> 11:17.942
¶ wrote this on the train
ride over here on the iPhone

12:41.160 --> 12:42.193
- what are you going to wear?

12:42.195 --> 12:42.193
- What?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.028
- What are you going to wear?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.930
- Um...

12:47.066 --> 12:51.136
Sweat pants and

12:53.038 --> 12:56.474
my white varsity hat, broken in

12:56.909 --> 12:59.477
and those Adidas
flip flops that have

12:59.479 --> 13:02.180
the things on them with socks.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.481
- Do you have those?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.150
- And a raincoat.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.551
Wait so you said this
was a fashion party so

13:06.553 --> 13:08.453
I should dress
like, high fashion,

13:08.455 --> 13:11.289
like really cool stuff.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.360
- How many times?

13:15.795 --> 13:16.995
- It's not the same
joke if it's different

13:16.997 --> 13:18.429
clothes every time.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.231
- It's the same joke, it's like.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.533
Stop!

13:21.535 --> 13:24.302
I did want to quit
my tumblr last week,

13:24.304 --> 13:26.070
because there was a
person who was like

13:26.072 --> 13:30.542
harassing me and Nick and
causing problems between us.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.111
If it's going to threaten
like my relationships,

13:33.113 --> 13:35.046
that's when it should stop.

13:35.514 --> 13:39.050
But then, it was like my
album was about to come out,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.886
it wasn't a good time
to stop using my tumblr

13:41.888 --> 13:43.888
or else everything I worked for,

13:43.890 --> 13:46.124
it wouldn't reach my audience.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.039
- You know I don't
like talking to people.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.039
- That's why I said
let's sit down and have

14:01.041 --> 14:05.310
pretend to have a very
in-depth conversation

14:05.544 --> 14:07.278
where no one else in invited.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.580
You can't do that.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.282
You have to look like
you're interested.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.222
That's a cupcake, dumbass.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.357
There's frosting.

14:21.126 --> 14:25.163
I'm going to punt this cupcake.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.605
- Wish
i knew how to play.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.405
- What?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.241
Wish I knew how to play.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.209
I mean, living with someone
definitely is always

14:38.211 --> 14:39.878
an issue.

14:39.880 --> 14:39.878
Woah, that's pretty.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.181
- Especially cause i
can spend 10 hours working

14:43.183 --> 14:45.516
on one song without
taking a break

14:45.518 --> 14:48.586
forgetting that
I'm even working.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.744
So basically I just want
to record the silence

17:27.747 --> 17:30.615
in a bunch of tragic rooms.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.750
The silence in a room
that's completely empty

17:32.752 --> 17:36.654
is different than the silence
of a room with 20 people

17:36.656 --> 17:39.457
in it and a dead body.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.726
- I could probably
say that I was

17:41.728 --> 17:43.294
doing a project for school.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.762
- Okay.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.230
- Then they would probably
be a little more lenient.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.365
Like if it's a student
rather than just a...

17:47.367 --> 17:48.766
- That's true.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.135
And just say that if there's
any way we could record

17:51.137 --> 17:55.339
just the presence of
dead people in the room.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.142
- Hi, have I reached
the New Jersey, Newark

17:58.144 --> 17:59.343
essex county morgue?

17:59.345 --> 18:00.778
- Yes, you have.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.582
- Is there any way, we're doing
an art project for school,

18:04.584 --> 18:09.654
and we wanted to record
and film the room tone

18:10.823 --> 18:13.191
of a morgue.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.393
Is that possible?

18:15.395 --> 18:16.594
- Um.

18:19.398 --> 18:22.333
- I'm not
really sure we'd be able

18:22.335 --> 18:24.635
to do something like that.

18:25.872 --> 18:25.870
- No, no, no, not
the room sizes,

18:25.872 --> 18:30.541
the room silence, like
the quiet, no sound.

18:33.847 --> 18:37.115
There's like a certain
tone of the room that

18:37.117 --> 18:40.218
- well every family
is so different in the way

18:40.220 --> 18:42.687
they react to death.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.190
Some are very noisy,
some are celebratory,

18:46.192 --> 18:50.161
not jumping for joy but
relieved that their loved one

18:50.163 --> 18:53.598
has you know, there is
no norm, I would say.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.600
- Okay.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.868
- That's what
we would want to explore.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.369
- Yeah, that's what we
kinda want to explore.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.205
How every family is
very very different.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.640
- Right.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.375
- So do you think it's
possible that we are able

19:04.377 --> 19:06.577
to record?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.912
- No,
absolutely not,

19:07.914 --> 19:10.615
not during a family funeral, no.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.782
- Okay.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.284
- That's
strictly private.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.386
- Okay, well, there are more.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.554
- What are you
going to tell people

19:16.556 --> 19:18.923
whose funerals you're
going to record?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.591
- I'm not going to talk to them.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.426
I'm just going to, that's
why I need interns,

19:22.428 --> 19:24.729
so they can talk for me to them.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.300
Or if you want to do it.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.235
- No, I don't want
any part of that.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.503
- See?

19:34.306 --> 19:36.274
But you don't want
me to have interns.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.309
- I don't not want
you to have interns.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.778
I just think you should
find somebody who

19:40.780 --> 19:44.282
you know that's not a
crazy 16-year-old girl

19:44.284 --> 19:46.584
who wants to rape you.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.219
- Okay.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.740
I don't know, I've
had a bit more time.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.643
Me and kitty broke up.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.213
And,

20:16.648 --> 20:18.983
so I guess I have
more time and this

20:18.985 --> 20:21.219
whole place to myself

20:21.221 --> 20:23.521
to work on stuff.

20:32.998 --> 20:36.400
It just started getting, i
guess toxic for both of us

20:36.402 --> 20:38.236
I feel like.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.813
- Well, I stopped
by, we got in a big fight.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.548
He stayed awake all
night but then when we

20:50.550 --> 20:52.416
left the hotel we had to
check out because it was

20:52.418 --> 20:53.884
the last day of south by.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.020
And I had a show so he
was all tired and stuff

20:56.022 --> 20:58.256
and he didn't know
what to do so he went

20:58.258 --> 21:00.258
and slept under an overpass.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.566
He recorded the sounds
underneath the overpass

21:08.568 --> 21:10.935
and made a song out of
it and then put it on his

21:10.937 --> 21:14.305
blog and it got all sorts
of, all sorts of notes.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.411
- Any time we
would wake up and log on

21:20.413 --> 21:22.780
to the Internet both
of us would get like 15

21:22.782 --> 21:25.983
marriage proposals from
like complete strangers.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.319
It's easy to read those
things when we're in the same

21:28.321 --> 21:30.821
room and we've been inseparable
for two weeks straight,

21:30.823 --> 21:32.990
and be like, oh I guess Nick
isn't sleeping with someone

21:32.992 --> 21:35.826
in Arizona which he's
never even been to.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.532
Those things are
things you can monitor,

21:41.534 --> 21:43.834
but when things are
happening on tour

21:43.836 --> 21:46.437
it's just really
nerve-wracking and it just

21:46.439 --> 21:48.472
consumed both of us.

22:01.787 --> 22:04.388
- Like I'm about
to go on the bigger tour,

22:04.390 --> 22:06.857
that's the scary one
because that's the one

22:06.859 --> 22:08.626
where I'm opening for
Danny brown every night.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.629
And he's like selling out shows
and it's really big venues,

22:11.631 --> 22:14.365
so I'm like, oh my god,
there's going to be 1500 people

22:14.367 --> 22:17.368
that don't really care
that I'm there at all.

22:24.076 --> 22:28.012
Check, check, check, talking.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.749
Okay.

22:32.117 --> 22:35.453
Do I need to keep
talking? Sorry.

22:36.722 --> 22:37.855
- Wait, what'd you say?

22:41.059 --> 22:42.093
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:42.095 --> 22:42.760
- Who is that?

22:42.762 --> 22:43.661
- I don't know.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.630
No, that's how it always is.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.124
- You good?

23:13.126 --> 23:15.059
- Yeah.

23:47.025 --> 23:52.096
- I love her,
but I just can't

23:54.733 --> 23:57.001
I just don't know
what else to say.

24:03.008 --> 24:06.043
Honestly, recording sounds
is the closest I have

24:06.045 --> 24:09.447
to having control,
over anything in life.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.048
It's always been reassuring
that I can record

24:11.050 --> 24:13.884
something and then
listen back to it.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.487
I'm literally playing
with the universe

24:16.489 --> 24:19.056
and holding it to my liking.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.958
So that's why I do it.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.861
It's a sense of
ownership and control.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.670
Your mom knows I'm coming?

24:32.672 --> 24:33.838
He's dealing with some
of the same annoying

24:33.840 --> 24:35.206
things I am, so,

24:35.208 --> 24:37.241
he's trying to lay low.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.944
He's outside of the city, so.

24:40.879 --> 24:40.878
- Yeah, my mom
knows what to cook,

24:40.880 --> 24:44.715
I told her to cook some
stuff for the pressure cooker

24:44.717 --> 24:47.117
cause that would
make cool sounds.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.686
- He kinda
regressed to being like

24:48.688 --> 24:50.521
a high-schooler again.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.122
His mom makes him food.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.158
He just chills in his room.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.660
Like I bet she does his laundry.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.129
He's just being a
spoiled teenager again.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.232
You don't have a,

25:02.133 --> 25:04.068
a Knicks poster on the wall.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.271
- No I don't have like
childhood posters, no.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.841
- I have disco dancer.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.042
- Oh yeah, it's awesome.

25:12.044 --> 25:12.042
- So good.

25:12.044 --> 25:17.114
- Best song was "i am a
disco dancer" ba-ba-ba-bah

25:17.116 --> 25:19.216
yeah ma?

25:19.218 --> 25:21.185
We're coming down though.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.120
My mom said you
should get the sound

25:23.122 --> 25:25.055
of the open frying

25:42.108 --> 25:42.106
- does she want to
be on the track?

25:42.108 --> 25:45.209
- Yeah, she can
cry on the track.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.810
- No one was
really recording

25:46.812 --> 25:49.580
on their own until
the 70s and you had to

25:49.582 --> 25:51.916
be a maniac because
it cost so much money.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.652
All the books you read
about how you have to record

25:54.654 --> 25:57.321
a beat, or how you
have to eq something,

25:57.323 --> 26:00.124
that all came from people
that want to give you

26:00.126 --> 26:03.227
guidelines so you don't
mess up or break it,

26:03.229 --> 26:05.062
but there really are no rules.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.031
The people who wrote
the rules are just

26:07.033 --> 26:08.299
playing it safe.

26:21.713 --> 26:24.682
- We pointing
pistols at the cops and shit

26:24.684 --> 26:27.017
until they stop the
fucking stop and frisk

26:27.019 --> 26:29.219
motherfuckers know the
fucking bop to this

26:29.221 --> 26:33.290
talk some shit, sit back
collect some guap to it

26:33.292 --> 26:35.326
I was bred in queens,

26:35.328 --> 26:38.062
I collect my bread in
Brooklyn with the team

26:38.064 --> 26:41.065
it's him, heemy,
Hollywood heems,

26:41.067 --> 26:43.834
won't stop til i
collect bollywood cream

26:43.836 --> 26:45.002
- you have another verse?

26:45.004 --> 26:46.136
You think you could
do another verse?

26:46.138 --> 26:48.205
- Yeah of course.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.212
- Heemy spit it for
the richest to the poorest man

26:55.214 --> 26:56.880
he the purest man

26:56.882 --> 26:58.148
Duran Duran

26:58.150 --> 27:00.050
wolf spirit, blood of the lamb

27:00.052 --> 27:01.251
you a waste of space

27:01.253 --> 27:03.087
your face like
gheorghe mure an

27:03.089 --> 27:04.288
the Sonic shamanic

27:04.290 --> 27:05.856
he prone to vomit

27:05.858 --> 27:07.057
he go awol

27:07.059 --> 27:08.325
he see a wall and vomit

27:08.327 --> 27:10.227
murder any song if he on it

27:10.229 --> 27:11.829
demonic

27:11.831 --> 27:14.198
scotch and whiskey, me
no drink no gin and tonic

27:14.200 --> 27:17.034
himanshu ride gnarly
til I'm farley, you see

27:17.036 --> 27:19.970
same future as the
dog in Marley and me

27:19.972 --> 27:22.873
or the CIA take me
out like Marley, a g

27:22.875 --> 27:25.776
my will say to bury me
with barley and wheat

27:25.778 --> 27:27.845
- that's great heems.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.748
- I'm going on tour in
Europe in like two weeks.

27:30.750 --> 27:31.715
- Oh yeah?

27:31.717 --> 27:33.150
Damn man.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.185
- I basically just wanted
to go to Paris because

27:35.187 --> 27:37.955
all this drama was
happening here.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.940
- It's weird,
this is the first time

30:09.942 --> 30:12.176
I've been in Paris where
i don't miss anyone.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.945
Generally when I'm here,
as soon as I go through

30:14.947 --> 30:17.481
an experience i
feel like telling my

30:17.483 --> 30:21.151
friends back home about
it, not in a mopey way,

30:21.153 --> 30:24.454
but I don't even know
who my friends back home

30:24.456 --> 30:26.924
are really at this point.

30:26.926 --> 30:30.894
Like everyone I'm friends with
is on a professional level

30:30.896 --> 30:34.264
too, and I didn't realize
it until I left New York,

30:34.266 --> 30:37.301
but you don't realize
how superficial

30:37.303 --> 30:40.337
all those friendships are.

30:40.905 --> 30:42.372
But as soon as you're
out of the picture,

30:42.374 --> 30:44.241
you're easily and
quickly replaced by

30:44.243 --> 30:47.444
anyone else that those people
are working with or whatever.

30:47.446 --> 30:51.114
And I'm guilty of that just
as much as anyone else is

30:51.116 --> 30:53.050
in New York.

30:54.252 --> 30:58.422
Like I don't miss
New York for once.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.127
Well this is my grandma's,
my grandparents' apartment.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.096
I keep saying grandma's
because my grandpa died

31:06.098 --> 31:09.867
when I was really young,
so I like forget that

31:09.869 --> 31:12.903
this was obviously
both of theirs.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.240
But anytime I'd come to
visit Paris we'd come here.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.143
I know that the
artwork on the walls

31:20.145 --> 31:22.512
is pretty somber.

31:23.014 --> 31:26.216
There's the entire Marquis
de sade collection,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.318
leather-bound and gold-leafed.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.989
Both my grandparents went
through the holocaust,

31:31.991 --> 31:36.326
so maybe that influenced
their aesthetic.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.481
I need to find a whole one.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.449
They're all like half-skulls.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.319
Oh this one's pretty.

32:19.704 --> 32:24.141
Ooo, you're like rotting.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.144
You're so gross,
all of you guys.

32:28.079 --> 32:32.149
I can't tell which one
of you's my favorite.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.518
Ah, you look pretty.

33:19.565 --> 33:23.300
- A lot of my
influences post 1990 I'd say,

33:23.302 --> 33:28.038
are rap producers and
almost all of them sample.

33:28.773 --> 33:33.410
So I feel weird disparaging
everything they do.

33:34.045 --> 33:37.280
But I think maybe
that era is over.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.250
That's the coolest
organ I've seen.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.352
Look how giant that is.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.355
And then they let these
idiots play it every night.

33:46.257 --> 33:49.192
Because they play
the same four songs.

33:49.194 --> 33:54.164
But like no one ever plays, uh,

33:55.233 --> 33:58.135
like, Eve's who's that girl,

33:58.137 --> 33:59.636
or any ruff ryders,
frankly, I don't think

33:59.638 --> 34:02.439
any ruff Ryder tracks,
and dame grease beats

34:02.441 --> 34:05.509
have ever been
played in notre dame.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.277
So that's a pity.

34:14.118 --> 34:17.120
Oh damn.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.094
This is my grandma's coat.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.297
I'm going to visit her.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.234
So maybe I'll just wear her
coat so she can see that

34:31.235 --> 34:33.737
we're still ballin.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.505
My grandpa died when i
was like seven or eight.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.341
The thing is he
never spoke English,

34:38.342 --> 34:40.377
he never like learned English.

34:40.379 --> 34:43.313
And it was weird because
that's my first language

34:43.315 --> 34:46.183
at the end of his life he
was still learning languages,

34:46.185 --> 34:49.453
and he was watching this
really cheesy instructional

34:49.455 --> 34:52.255
video to teach
French people English

34:52.257 --> 34:55.692
so it was a guy doing
like the Titanic pose,

34:55.694 --> 34:59.362
looking over a bridge
and then he was like.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.765
" I can fly, I can fly"

35:01.767 --> 35:05.235
and then all I remember
is my grandpa laughing,

35:05.237 --> 35:07.437
looking at me and
being like "i can fly"

35:07.439 --> 35:10.240
which literally was the first
time I even heard him attempt

35:10.242 --> 35:12.776
to say any word in English.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.213
And it was just really
scary but it was also like

35:16.414 --> 35:18.115
whoa, he's speaking English now,

35:18.117 --> 35:21.685
he's going to speak
English forever,

35:21.886 --> 35:24.221
and that was the
last time I saw him.

36:42.266 --> 36:47.337
That's me, brushing
off my family tomb.

38:38.649 --> 38:42.052
I think some people rely
on humanity too heavily.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.688
I love people, but I'm
also aware that they're

38:44.690 --> 38:44.688
all kinda dumb.

38:44.690 --> 38:49.392
I also aware that there are
other things on this earth

38:49.394 --> 38:52.962
and humans are just
a kind of animal.

39:26.931 --> 39:30.066
I'm tired.

39:31.035 --> 39:36.072
So both my grandparents
were Polish

39:36.807 --> 39:40.944
and during the holocaust
their entire families

39:40.946 --> 39:46.015
were ruined by world war ii
and the concentration camps.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.519
They would never
really mention it,

39:49.521 --> 39:52.389
like they since they'd gone
through and lived through it

39:52.391 --> 39:54.824
it wasn't something
that they dwelled on.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.828
Like my grandma would
rather complain about the

39:58.830 --> 40:03.967
air conditioning in a
restaurant than ever talk about

40:03.969 --> 40:07.404
how her sister was
murdered in front of her

40:07.406 --> 40:10.173
or how she lost literally
everyone in her family

40:10.175 --> 40:12.008
and stuff like that.

40:12.010 --> 40:15.879
My grandpa was married
and had a child

40:16.881 --> 40:21.951
and at the gate of
the concentration camp

40:21.953 --> 40:25.688
they separate the men from
the women from the children

40:25.690 --> 40:29.959
and his wife wouldn't let
go of her newborn child

40:29.961 --> 40:33.730
and their child so
they immediately
sent her to a chamber

40:33.732 --> 40:36.065
and killed her and the baby.

40:36.067 --> 40:41.137
His whole story was
super long and mythical

40:43.207 --> 40:45.875
in what he had to deal with.

40:45.877 --> 40:45.875
So it's weird, when
i look back at it

40:45.877 --> 40:50.013
it definitely makes me feel
like the most worthless

40:50.015 --> 40:53.216
piece of shit ever cause
i could complain about

40:53.218 --> 40:56.586
anything in the
world at all times.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.189
And my grandpa had to
eat frozen tree roots

40:59.191 --> 41:04.461
in the uzbekistani tundra
for a bunch of months

41:06.797 --> 41:08.932
with no one left in his life.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.868
Cool.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.038
Oh, this is hoppin'

41:16.674 --> 41:21.044
I've played just as many
shows without anyone there

41:21.046 --> 41:24.247
as I have shows that are
crowded at this point.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.150
I mean it's super fun when
there's a lot of people

41:27.152 --> 41:28.718
and they're enjoying it,

41:28.720 --> 41:31.154
but I guess I'm just
jaded by the Internet.

41:31.922 --> 41:35.892
I can post a photo of
me doing something silly

41:35.894 --> 41:38.561
it'll have more notes
than there could be people

41:38.563 --> 41:41.498
at that entire venue.

43:14.158 --> 43:17.226
I care less and less
about the industry side of

43:17.228 --> 43:19.596
all of this stuff.

43:20.631 --> 43:23.132
The most rewarding thing
is when someone tells you

43:23.134 --> 43:25.368
that they've listened to
your stuff so many times

43:25.370 --> 43:28.004
that it changed them
or it's the only thing

43:28.006 --> 43:31.741
that helps them go
to a special place.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.783
You want a peanut M&M?

44:13.785 --> 44:16.352
- Oh hell, yeah.

44:18.689 --> 44:21.224
Thank you. Perfect.

44:23.260 --> 44:24.260
I don't know, what'd she say,

44:24.262 --> 44:25.428
first door on the left?

44:25.430 --> 44:27.130
This isn't it, this can't be it.

44:27.132 --> 44:28.698
- No this is a medical building.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.199
- This is a medical building.

44:31.201 --> 44:32.101
- All right where is this?

44:32.103 --> 44:33.403
- Damn, this campus is nice.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.272
- It's this one, right?

44:36.274 --> 44:38.207
- Oh, yes, yes.

44:38.776 --> 44:41.310
- I can feel the magic already.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.845
- No, wait, these are going up.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.280
- Well, we're going to 37.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.182
- Oh, you're right,
you're right.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.817
- Is that him?

44:50.721 --> 44:52.889
- This looks like
a doctor's office.

44:52.891 --> 44:53.823
Oh great.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.992
- Maybe there's another door.

44:55.994 --> 44:57.927
- You find the place okay?

44:57.929 --> 44:59.062
- Uh, yeah, it was really easy.

44:59.064 --> 44:59.062
- Oh great, okay.

44:59.064 --> 45:01.698
A lot of people get
lost in this building.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.299
- Ah, not.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.034
- Not us.

45:05.036 --> 45:08.905
- This is room 3420 boelter hall

45:08.907 --> 45:10.840
this was the first
site on the arpanet

45:10.842 --> 45:13.076
it was called the network
measurement center.

45:13.078 --> 45:15.712
So once they got a few
nodes linked together,

45:15.714 --> 45:17.180
it was here that they did a
whole bunch of measurements

45:17.182 --> 45:19.048
and testing because no
one knew how one of these

45:19.050 --> 45:20.817
networks would behave.

45:20.819 --> 45:23.286
And it was through that
thing that they did it.

45:23.288 --> 45:24.921
- It looks pretty easy,
there's a run button.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.122
- Yeah, that's all you do.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.024
- Just
press run, the box is

45:28.026 --> 45:29.859
just holding one tiny iPhone.

45:29.861 --> 45:31.160
- Yeah, exactly.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.863
Here's people working
on the systems.

45:33.865 --> 45:37.433
You've got some kind
of world strategy

45:37.435 --> 45:41.304
magic game they're
playing over there.

45:41.306 --> 45:45.007
This is the fearless
leader Leonard kleinrock

45:45.009 --> 45:46.209
sporting a

45:46.211 --> 45:47.143
- I saw his picture

45:47.145 --> 45:48.111
- a short-sleeved turtleneck

45:48.113 --> 45:48.111
- I like that.

45:48.113 --> 45:50.513
- Beautiful,
beautiful turtleneck.

45:50.515 --> 45:51.380
- I'm going to
disappear and you can do

45:51.382 --> 45:52.782
whatever you want.

45:52.784 --> 45:54.050
- Okay cool. Well
thanks for the tour.

45:54.052 --> 45:55.284
- Yeah, no problem.
You know where I am.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.420
- Okay, thanks so much.

45:58.222 --> 46:00.823
It all started
because of this room.

46:01.291 --> 46:03.092
- Here is the Internet.

46:03.094 --> 46:06.195
- This is where
typed to some other,

46:06.197 --> 46:08.364
had his pants down
sitting at this thing

46:08.366 --> 46:10.933
and was like send me a nude

46:10.935 --> 46:12.201
- what's up dude?

46:12.203 --> 46:13.870
- And then it came here.

46:18.242 --> 46:21.277
Can I see, with the letter c

46:21.812 --> 46:24.814
your boobs with zeros.

46:24.816 --> 46:27.049
- Obviously.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.288
Now we wait.

46:33.323 --> 46:35.424
- I can't tell if
this is a button.

46:35.426 --> 46:37.260
- Ooo!

46:37.262 --> 46:38.194
- Did you break it?

46:38.196 --> 46:38.961
- No. But...

46:38.963 --> 46:40.797
- That's hilarious.

47:00.184 --> 47:02.819
- When I started
recording the silence of rooms

47:02.821 --> 47:06.088
I suggested that each
room had its own distinct

47:06.090 --> 47:09.592
and powerful room tone
that was recognizable.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.361
It's silly to think oh
there's nothing going on,

47:12.363 --> 47:14.564
it's silent, there's
nothing there.

47:14.566 --> 47:16.532
We're hearing something
it's just that we're not

47:16.534 --> 47:18.234
paying attention to it.

47:18.236 --> 47:21.938
So I've been recording all
these silences and I wanted

47:21.940 --> 47:25.341
to get the silence of
meaningful locations,

47:25.343 --> 47:27.877
to compare them to
see if one place

47:27.879 --> 47:29.579
felt different than the other,

47:29.581 --> 47:31.981
even if they're
not familiar to me,

47:31.983 --> 47:36.419
to see if there was a
mood shift of some sort.

48:42.352 --> 48:45.321
- Is that your face, is
that your picture face?

48:45.323 --> 48:45.321
Is that it?

48:45.323 --> 48:49.325
- That's the only picture
face I know how to do.

48:50.027 --> 48:51.193
Well, Shelby's cool.

48:51.195 --> 48:52.495
I mean, she's cool,
she's really nice.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.063
I don't know.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.400
She like light-hearted
and seems to avoid drama.

48:57.402 --> 48:59.502
Which is fun.

49:00.370 --> 49:02.138
- Yeah that's it,
you're getting it.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.140
- I'm getting it, all right.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.278
- Just take it!

49:12.449 --> 49:14.650
Oh it's a bad....

49:50.253 --> 49:54.323
- Rock against mountain.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.227
- I was going to
wait for you guys to leave

50:31.229 --> 50:33.229
so I can scream, is
it okay if I scream?

50:33.231 --> 50:34.463
- Wait, can I record
you screaming?

50:34.465 --> 50:35.398
- What?

50:35.400 --> 50:37.400
- Can I record you screaming?

50:37.402 --> 50:38.467
I'm recording sounds in here.

50:38.469 --> 50:39.568
- Oh, is that right?

50:39.570 --> 50:41.203
- Yeah.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.705
- All right, but
don't show my face though.

50:43.306 --> 50:45.441
- What's your name?

50:45.443 --> 50:47.109
- Uh, John.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.544
- Cool.

50:50.414 --> 50:52.314
Okay, scream as loud as you can

50:52.316 --> 50:54.517
and try to hold the same note.

51:23.346 --> 51:24.113
That's it.

51:24.115 --> 51:26.482
- That's it?

54:03.240 --> 54:04.773
Excuse me?

54:04.775 --> 54:08.410
Can you listen to
my music afterwards?

54:08.412 --> 54:10.479
- No I can't.

54:12.582 --> 54:15.384
- Piece of shit.

54:25.362 --> 54:27.529
- What do you want
to do after this?

54:30.333 --> 54:32.935
- Um, can you drive me to,

54:33.370 --> 54:34.737
I'm supposed to pick
up these firecrackers

54:34.739 --> 54:37.373
from this guy I found
on the Internet.

54:38.008 --> 54:41.510
He's like a party clown for
like birthday parties and stuff

54:41.745 --> 54:42.878
and he seems really chill and

54:42.880 --> 54:45.414
he just wants to
get rid of them.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.583
So and then we can go
light them somewhere.

54:47.585 --> 54:49.918
- Light em up and you record it?

54:49.920 --> 54:51.520
- There's a school next
to where I'm staying.

54:51.522 --> 54:52.955
We could just break
in and set them off

54:52.957 --> 54:55.758
in the gym or something.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.326
- Okay.

54:57.328 --> 54:58.794
- I'll show you his
thing, he's really chill.

54:58.796 --> 55:02.464
He's like, there's
like clipart and...

55:05.535 --> 55:07.803
- And we'll find a
place to blow them up.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.972
- Yeah, he's just like.

55:12.409 --> 55:14.643
- Oh, that
picture is creepy.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.386
- Keep going.

55:26.323 --> 55:28.791
Yeah so he said he's in a Volvo.

55:34.798 --> 55:36.365
- Is that him?

55:36.367 --> 55:38.400
- No, that's not him.

55:41.971 --> 55:44.340
Pull up.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.542
I think this is him.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.811
Yeah, that's him.

55:53.616 --> 55:56.418
Is he getting out?

55:56.420 --> 55:57.486
Okay let's get out.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.088
You want to park it?

55:59.090 --> 56:00.122
Park next to him.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.491
Or near him.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.667
He's weird.

56:20.543 --> 56:23.379
Hey, I'm Nick.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.447
- You're the one
who messaged me?

56:25.449 --> 56:26.382
- Yeah, yeah I'm Nick.

56:26.384 --> 56:26.949
- Who's this fucker?

56:26.951 --> 56:28.817
- That's my friend.

56:28.819 --> 56:31.487
I just want like the, yeah.

56:44.834 --> 56:47.903
- Roman candles, too
many Roman candles,

56:47.905 --> 56:50.105
not too offensive you
know what I'm saying?

56:50.107 --> 56:50.105
- Uh, okay cool.

56:50.107 --> 56:52.574
- In case you don't
want to start the uh,

56:52.576 --> 56:55.010
tet offensive there.

56:55.012 --> 56:58.480
Sixteen shot happies I got.

56:59.482 --> 57:02.084
You know, that's like
bombs over Baghdad shit.

57:02.452 --> 57:03.652
I can't give that to you though.

57:03.654 --> 57:04.720
This is green heaven.

57:04.722 --> 57:06.455
- Why can't

57:06.457 --> 57:07.423
- this is

57:08.425 --> 57:10.058
this is industrial grade.

57:10.060 --> 57:13.195
- How much for, if i
wanted all of them?

57:13.197 --> 57:14.530
- I got a 500 grand keg.

57:14.532 --> 57:15.197
- Oh this

57:15.199 --> 57:15.197
- that I want.

57:15.199 --> 57:19.034
- That'll fly around
and buzz and light up

57:19.036 --> 57:21.036
and all that shit you want.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.871
I got red and green sparklers.

57:22.873 --> 57:23.906
- I don't want those.

57:23.908 --> 57:24.706
- For 2.50.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.175
- We have big sparklers.

57:26.177 --> 57:27.509
- Tell you what, take these
and I'll let you have those.

57:27.511 --> 57:29.011
- Okay thank you.

57:30.046 --> 57:32.014
- What are you guys going to
do with all this stuff anyway?

57:32.016 --> 57:32.981
- Just uh

57:32.983 --> 57:34.082
- celebrate.

57:34.084 --> 57:35.083
- Yeah.

57:35.085 --> 57:36.852
- What are you celebrating?

57:36.854 --> 57:39.455
- Uh, life. We're
just going to celebrate life.

57:39.722 --> 57:41.957
- Cause I'll tell you
something, something like that,

57:41.959 --> 57:43.459
it's like an rpg.

57:43.461 --> 57:44.827
That'll take out a
tank, I've seen it.

57:44.829 --> 57:46.628
- We don't
need artillery.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.197
- Weird.

57:48.199 --> 57:49.698
- I've seen it happen.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.633
I've seen this melt a face off.

57:52.068 --> 57:53.502
And I'm not even
talking about a guy

57:53.504 --> 57:54.136
who volunteered for stuff,

57:54.138 --> 57:56.505
I'm talking about kids.

57:57.740 --> 57:58.640
- This is just meant to

57:58.642 --> 57:59.975
be like a visual expression.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.176
- Exactly, we're
honestly I'm just...

58:01.178 --> 58:02.478
- What?

58:02.480 --> 58:03.479
- What?

58:03.481 --> 58:03.479
- Supposed to be a what?

58:03.481 --> 58:06.081
- We're just celebrating
with fireworks.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.216
- To be honest...

58:07.218 --> 58:08.650
- Visual expression?

58:08.652 --> 58:09.518
- Yeah.

58:09.520 --> 58:09.985
- Of happiness.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.153
- What is that?

58:11.155 --> 58:12.588
- That's what this,
these are going to

58:12.590 --> 58:15.724
create a visual ambience and...

58:15.726 --> 58:17.726
- All right, fellas.

58:18.228 --> 58:18.227
- 16.

58:18.229 --> 58:20.529
- 30 bucks doesn't
even pay for my gas.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.264
- No 46, total.

58:23.066 --> 58:24.233
- Is that a two dollar bill?

58:24.235 --> 58:24.233
- Yeah, these are
all two dollar bills

58:24.235 --> 58:28.136
but we need more of like
the pit vipers and stuff.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.271
- You just said you
didn't want that stuff.

58:29.273 --> 58:30.205
- I said...

58:30.207 --> 58:31.640
- It's for visual expression.

58:31.642 --> 58:32.975
Do you mind not putting
your hand in my car?

58:32.977 --> 58:32.975
- I'm sorry.

58:32.977 --> 58:35.978
- I got my kids clothes and
the toys and stuff in there

58:35.980 --> 58:36.945
I don't want your
fingers all over it.

58:36.947 --> 58:37.880
- Okay, I'm sorry.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.281
- You have children?

58:39.283 --> 58:41.016
- What's that any
of your business?

58:41.018 --> 58:42.150
- You told me

58:42.152 --> 58:43.151
- you asking about
my family now?

58:43.153 --> 58:44.853
- I didn't ask you.

58:46.289 --> 58:48.790
- Don't grab! You want
something, tell me, I'll get it.

58:48.792 --> 58:49.958
You go into the store
you reach behind

58:49.960 --> 58:51.660
the counter when
you want rubbers?

58:51.662 --> 58:52.261
- Okay.

58:52.263 --> 58:53.896
- Okay.

58:53.898 --> 58:55.197
- I asked you once nicely
I'm asking you again

58:55.199 --> 58:56.999
I'm not going to
ask a third time.

58:57.001 --> 58:58.200
- Great, well then.

58:58.202 --> 59:00.569
- Have a nice evening gentlemen.

59:04.007 --> 59:06.041
- That dude sucked.

59:06.643 --> 59:08.010
- What's that shit
he's talking about

59:08.012 --> 59:10.212
taking down airplanes with.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.247
- Whatever.

59:12.249 --> 59:14.783
- Who uses fireworks
to take down airplanes?

59:14.785 --> 59:16.952
- That's true.

59:22.158 --> 59:24.660
- Do not hold in hand.

59:24.662 --> 59:26.728
- That's what it says.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.830
But I've never not
held it in my hand.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:32.894
- That was cool.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:04.259
Oh, there's a cool
seagull over there.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.197
Humans just have this
assumption that humanity

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:13.368
is the pinnacle of
sophistication and importance

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:16.672
on this planet and
it's so shallow.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.740
The universe is full of sound,

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:21.376
and to think that the
human voice is the most

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.311
important just because
we're humans and

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:27.215
it's the most relatable,
is incredibly shallow.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.319
What if the only type of
photography that existed

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.321
was of other people.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:37.292
And if someone took these
massive landscape shots

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:39.227
and if they were like
ridiculed and they're like

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:40.362
there's no person in there

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:43.331
what's the point
of looking at that?

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:46.334
We have photos and
videos of everything.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:49.137
Like I can tell you
what a rhino looks like,

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.807
I can draw a rhinoceros, i
could back in kindergarten,

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:55.077
but I can't tell you
what it sounds like.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:04.352
- Fuck it. I grew up right,
down along the beach.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.254
- On the beach?

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:07.322
- Yeah.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.824
- Oh, whoa.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.893
- I mean, I wasn't a vagrant.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.328
- Yeah.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.032
Where's Disneyland from here?

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:17.032
- Southeast?

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:20.335
- I heard no one's allowed
to be pronounced dead

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.003
in Disneyland?

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:24.940
- Yeah, yeah, when anything
happens on the premises

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:26.241
and people have died...

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:26.241
- On there.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:30.779
- On the premises of Disneyland
or Disney world or whatever

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:35.851
but yeah, they take the
bodies outside of their,

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.988
- yeah.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.791
- Technical land ownership
to be pronounced dead.

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:44.459
It's pretty fucked up, isn't it?

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:46.228
- Yeah.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:47.863
But..

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:49.297
- Just to preserve
the sanctity of what?

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.866
Your bullshit?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.067
- Of the...

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:54.803
- Your total total
fucking bullshit?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.273
- I want to be the first person

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:01.309
pronounced dead in Disneyland.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.345
- My man.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.313
- We'll get there.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:08.483
- I got high hopes for you yet.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.894
- I wonder what that clown's
doing right now though.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:53.495
I went to my friend
bill's funeral, which was

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:56.998
very weird because I thought
he had died a year before.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:03.004
He was a really reclusive guy.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.841
He didn't have any friends,
he didn't have a wife or kids.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.976
He just didn't like
people and the only reason

01:04:07.978 --> 01:04:10.378
we related was because
we both loved music

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.249
and we both used the
same type of technology

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.451
I guess while making that music.

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.489
When I met him he was
around 85 years old and

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.959
he lived alone, in
the same building,

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:27.596
he lived upstairs except he
had nothing in his apartment,

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:31.166
it was just bare with a
wooden chair, a computer.

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:36.571
As he mentioned he was a
child of the depression era,

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:41.643
so he didn't like wasting
money and instead of buying

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:46.448
someone else's rendition of
a classical piece he liked

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.517
he would just buy the
sheet music which was

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:53.321
a little bit cheaper, and
then he'd transcribe it

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:57.525
into midi and have
the computer play it.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:04.199
One day, not one day, i
come for like two weeks

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:08.503
and he wasn't picking up and
finally I asked the super

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.572
where he was, what
happened, people downstairs

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:13.408
were just like oh, yeah, I'm
sorry he died, he passed away,

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.110
I'm sorry you didn't know that.

01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.946
Well he got taken out
on a stretcher and then

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:21.583
the next day a lawyer came
to get some of his stuff

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.953
and according to them that
means that he was dead.

01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:28.523
I took that as a
concrete statement.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:36.331
I was incredibly overwhelmed
and I wrote this eulogy

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.300
and everything.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.511
And turns out few
months later I found out

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:51.446
he wasn't dead at all.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:56.284
He basically got transported
to some va hospital

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.220
and then put into
a nursing home,

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:01.623
which, had I known, it
would have been different,

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.093
because he despised
nursing homes.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.997
He passed away about a
year after I thought he

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:10.432
had already died.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:13.969
And there was a sign right
next to the elevator that said

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:17.105
our dear friend bill
has passed away.

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:21.643
The service is tomorrow
morning at nine in the morning,

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.412
three hours away from here.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.316
I guess I tweeted that i
didn't have a ride to my

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:33.388
friend's funeral and luckily a
cool person from the Internet

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:37.025
offered, volunteered
to drive me.

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:44.499
- Right here.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:51.439
Wow. Zero people here.

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.408
- Wow.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.059
- I was the
only person there.

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:46.428
It was so weird.

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:49.397
My initial fear was that
I'd show up and I'd be

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:53.101
out of place because
i wasn't family,

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:56.438
I wasn't like an old
friend from the war

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.474
and I'd have to
justify my presence.

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.476
I got there and there
was no one there.

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:03.745
Literally, I was the
closest person to him,

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.781
which was very unsettling.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.523
Bill knew how much
i loved recording

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:52.560
and he was usually
a part of that.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:57.765
So, I recorded the funeral.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:03.337
When I was contacting
funeral homes to record

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.607
I wasn't attached to
any of the deceased,

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:09.243
but bill was such an
influence and such a big

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:12.546
part of my I guess
musical identity,

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:15.450
that I don't know, i
don't think I was ready

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:18.553
to prove myself.

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:23.658
The silence of that room is
terrifying and I can't even,

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.428
it's just such a bummer.

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:39.841
I tried to make a song
out of the recordings,

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:44.345
the silence in that room
is too intense for me to

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:48.216
really listen to to be honest.

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:14.442
I guess it's the most fitting
since he's one of the people

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:19.480
that I like confided
in the most, musically,

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.352
but,

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.358
yeah, I guess.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.627
And it definitely makes
it more meaningful.

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:35.964
I mean I've used bill
in my recordings before,

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:39.634
in moon money a lot
of the random patches

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:42.303
are him breathing.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:47.275
Now I have him not breathing.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.472
When someone asks me
what's the weirdest sound

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.041
I've ever used?

01:11:53.043 --> 01:11:55.677
That's the first question
anyone asks in any interview.

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.545
What if I told you
i took a dead cat,

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.481
I ripped its intestines
out, diligently spread

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:04.552
it over a bucket and then
nailed it around the bucket,

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.954
and then I beat it with a stick.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.424
That'd be psychopathic,
to most people.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.792
That's what a drum is.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.094
Cat guts nailed to a bucket.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.396
So I'm the weird one because
i throw a beanie baby

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:18.599
against the wall and
make a snare out of that?

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:21.669
The silence in this room
can be louder than any drum

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:25.340
has ever been in the
history of the world.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.729
Outer space is the most
comforting thought I have

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:38.799
cause I like reminding myself
we're all just pieces of stars

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:42.904
and you make whatever
significance you want in life.

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.739
But if you're searching for
something you're not going

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.141
to find it it's just stupid.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:55.316
The fact that the solar
system is so gigantic,

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:57.885
and the assumptions
that the entire world

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.055
is human based and
everything around here was

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.990
created by a person.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:06.327
The only things we pay
attention to are human voices.

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:08.629
We're just stuck
in our human world.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.200
- I think there's a lot of
misunderstanding about sounds

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:14.735
in space.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:19.574
A sound is simply a pressure
wave through a medium,

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.709
and the medium can be anything.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:22.643
I mean it could be
this wooden table,

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.681
it could be steel, like
the tracks of a train,

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.583
it could be air.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:31.752
And if there is no
medium to transmit sound,

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.355
there is no sound.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:37.024
- And is that the case
with, I guess sound

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:39.694
in the rest of the world
what we perceive as silence

01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:43.264
for example in a quiet room,
below our audible range,

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:48.102
if we were to record it
and amplify it to even

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:52.373
a deafeningly loud
decibel level,

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.342
is that, what are
we listening to?

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:55.242
- The sound of silence?

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:55.876
- Yeah.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.378
- Yeah, so.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:00.014
We have this bias.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:03.084
Because our human
form is all we know.

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:07.822
So the bias is, that what we
see and experience in the world

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:09.890
is the world.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:12.326
And that's an
extraordinary bias.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.396
It's a bias of our own biology,

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:18.032
our own five senses.

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:19.834
And all molecules are vibrating.

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:22.269
Everything is vibrating.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:24.305
Everything.

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.307
If it has a temperature,
it's vibrating.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:29.677
- So for that purpose, if
everything's vibrating,

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:32.847
in our, on earth, does that
mean everything's making

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:37.318
a sound of some sort, even
if it's not close to a level

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.887
we could hear?

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.689
- I think that's fair enough.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:44.692
Keep in mind if you have
an audio recording device

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:47.261
you are always listening
to the sound after

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.163
it has moved through air.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.097
- Of course.

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:52.066
- So be careful not to confuse

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.668
the sound you're trying to get,

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:57.238
with the actual sound
of air being air.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.839
- Or the room in
most cases, if I have

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:01.108
to amplify the volume.

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:01.208
- Uh, yeah.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.812
Unless you went into a
perfectly anechoic room.

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:06.080
- Yeah.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:07.948
Going to pavlov's studies,

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:11.452
when he rang his bell
to signal his dog,

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.988
let his dog know there was

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.690
food out on the
table or something,

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:18.059
after a while the dog
not only responded

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:20.261
psychologically knowing that
there was going to be food,

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.363
but the dog actually started
responding physically,

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:22.363
salivating.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:27.068
That's because the dog
had associated the sound

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.170
of that bell to food.

01:18:29.172 --> 01:18:31.372
I mean we come across
countless sounds in

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:33.140
our day to day lives that
we're either consciously

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:35.876
or sub-consciously attached to.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.412
And we link it to a
mood or an idea...

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.780
- All the time.

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:41.015
- All the time.

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:41.182
- That's what music is really.

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:44.085
Music is the organized
version of that.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:47.922
- So can we harness
those associated sounds?

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:48.789
- Yes.

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:49.757
Completely.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:51.058
- In music?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.393
- I don't see why not.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:55.329
- So, lastly, is
there a way we can

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:58.399
subtly disguise those
associated sounds

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:02.069
that we've grown accustomed to?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.971
- I don't see why not.

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:05.840
I mean, what do you
do when you isolate

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:07.308
a medicine from an herb?

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.243
The herb has 100
things you don't want

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:09.243
and the one thing you do want,

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.446
if it was shown to be
medicinally useful.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:13.948
So you analyze it in the lab,

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.483
you extract what's
useful, you leave out

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:19.019
what's not useful and then
you make a pill out of that.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.288
- You extract
what's useful, you leave out

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:24.458
what's not useful and then
you make a pill out of that.

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:20.374
I think for the first time in
my life I'm looking forward

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:25.446
to being, to like growing old.

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:31.352
I don't have any obstacles
other than my own thoughts now.

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:35.422
And I want to capture
the beauty of the world

01:21:35.424 --> 01:21:39.493
because I think a lot of
times it's hard to see it.

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.462
Everyone can say open
your eyes, the world is

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:44.298
beautiful around you,
but they say that and the

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.367
rest of the time they're
just hating their phones,

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:49.904
they're hating how long the
bus takes to pick them up

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:52.206
they hate their job they
hate all of the time

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:53.674
and then they'll just be
like, but look around you,

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:55.276
it's beautiful.

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:58.979
I mean I'm the same way,
but, I want to record those

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.682
beautiful things to remind
me, so everytime you listen

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:05.519
to the music you
hear the beauty.
