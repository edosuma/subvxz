00:01.435 --> 00:05.435
[Crow caws]

00:06.674 --> 00:08.675
[Door opens]

00:08.676 --> 00:11.277
Hey, dad, did you say you
wanted me to get you up at 6:10?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.947
No one's ever said that
in this house. [Groans]

00:13.948 --> 00:15.448
I said 8:00.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.116
Ohh, okay.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.819
[Door closes, opens]

00:19.820 --> 00:22.789
Unless you wanted to get up
now since you're already awake.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.857
We could get the college tour going early.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.483
Nope. I'm good. Wait until 8:00.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.494
Got it.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.338
[Door closes, opens]

00:29.339 --> 00:30.443
- [Groans]
- I'm sorry.

00:30.444 --> 00:32.317
I just have to say that can you believe

00:32.319 --> 00:34.711
in a year from now I won't even be here?

00:34.712 --> 00:36.175
Why don't you go back to your room now

00:36.176 --> 00:38.278
so we can start getting
used to what that feels like?

00:38.279 --> 00:39.535
Okay. Got it.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.736
You might as well get up
now. She's not gonna go away.

00:43.737 --> 00:45.583
[Groans]

00:45.584 --> 00:47.528
Frankie: So with me stuck having to work,

00:47.529 --> 00:49.841
Mike was the designated driver

00:49.842 --> 00:52.896
on Sue's first whirlwind
weekend of college tours.

00:52.897 --> 00:56.044
All right, everyone. I'd like
to welcome you all to I.U.

00:56.045 --> 00:57.444
Today, we'll be starting our tour

00:57.445 --> 00:58.860
in front of our chemistry building.

00:58.861 --> 01:00.429
"Chemistry building."

01:00.430 --> 01:03.708
I'm gonna need to draw a
map. Which way is north?

01:03.709 --> 01:04.973
Over 180 majors.

01:04.974 --> 01:07.717
This may be of interest to
you... we also offer a minor

01:07.718 --> 01:09.653
in native American and indigenous peoples.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.413
- Oh.
- Okay, now, I know

01:12.414 --> 01:14.341
a lot of you want to know
about student housing, so...

01:14.342 --> 01:15.586
Man: Wait. I have a question.

01:15.587 --> 01:18.286
Is there any nearby housing for parents?

01:18.287 --> 01:20.177
'Cause I don't think
Maddie here can survive

01:20.178 --> 01:23.321
without her Saturday
morning super daddy pancakes.

01:23.322 --> 01:25.014
- [Laughs]
- Maddie: [Chuckling] Dad, stop.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.357
You're making me hungry.

01:26.358 --> 01:29.806
Secret ingredient is love.
I'm kidding. It's cinnamon.

01:29.807 --> 01:31.966
[Chuckles] Okay. Uh, let's move on.

01:33.642 --> 01:35.616
Oh, when we pass by Willkie auditorium,

01:35.617 --> 01:36.750
remind me to tell you

01:36.751 --> 01:39.000
about our traditional first nations powwow.

01:39.001 --> 01:42.144
There's a huge inter-tribal
dance. So amazing.

01:44.744 --> 01:46.597
- [Door closes]
- Frankie: Hey, Brick.

01:46.598 --> 01:49.214
So, listen. I was thinking.

01:49.215 --> 01:51.741
It's just you and me this whole weekend.

01:51.742 --> 01:53.469
Why don't we do something special?

01:53.470 --> 01:56.072
When's the last time we
did anything together,

01:56.073 --> 01:57.166
just the two of us?

01:57.167 --> 01:59.334
Hmm, when you took me to the pediatrician

01:59.335 --> 02:00.718
to get that tetanus shot.

02:00.719 --> 02:02.200
- [Sighs]
- [Telephone ringing]

02:02.201 --> 02:04.833
All right, while I get that,
why don't you make a list

02:04.834 --> 02:06.658
of all the things you
want to do this weekend?

02:06.659 --> 02:07.835
Anything at all... your pick.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.410
- Really? Great.
- [Beep]

02:09.411 --> 02:12.483
Hello? Hey, Axl! Is everything okay?

02:12.484 --> 02:14.547
What? Are you kidding me?

02:14.548 --> 02:16.647
They're playing him. They're playing you?

02:16.648 --> 02:19.567
Well, uh, yeah. Of course I'll be there.

02:19.568 --> 02:22.674
Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit, then.

02:22.675 --> 02:23.687
Whoo-hoo!

02:23.688 --> 02:26.940
All right, well, um,
slight change of plans.

02:26.941 --> 02:29.348
Axl's coach is finally
playing him tomorrow.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.021
So we'll sleep over at Axl's tonight,

02:31.022 --> 02:32.525
and then we can see
the game in the morning.

02:32.526 --> 02:34.862
You know how much I love
football tournaments,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.589
but we can't be gone the whole weekend.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.027
We have a project due Monday.

02:38.028 --> 02:39.584
What? What project?

02:39.585 --> 02:42.951
We have to build a car that
can go 50 feet, or we fail.

02:42.952 --> 02:44.929
And how much have "we" done?

02:44.930 --> 02:46.969
Well, we're still in the research phase.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.845
- So nothing.
- Pretty much.

02:48.846 --> 02:50.501
Brick! [Sighs]

02:50.502 --> 02:53.550
Fine. I'm just gonna have
to get somebody to watch you.

02:53.551 --> 02:55.940
I'm sorry, but I'm not
missing Axl's first game

02:55.941 --> 02:57.203
because you didn't plan ahead.

02:57.204 --> 02:58.844
You're gonna have to figure
this one out yourself.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.037
This is your project, not mine. [Dialing]

03:02.364 --> 03:03.370
Hey, you sure you don't want my bed?

03:03.371 --> 03:04.774
I can crash on the couch.

03:04.775 --> 03:07.834
No way. You have a big game tomorrow.

03:07.835 --> 03:09.674
You got to sleep in your own bed.

03:09.675 --> 03:11.275
Hmm.

03:13.722 --> 03:16.017
Axl, have you ever cleaned that bathroom?

03:16.018 --> 03:18.336
Hey, we're on it. We're
flushing every time now.

03:18.337 --> 03:20.219
Seriously, if you ever want
to have a girl over here,

03:20.220 --> 03:21.508
you got to take care of that.

03:21.509 --> 03:23.507
Do you even have any cleaning products?

03:23.508 --> 03:25.299
I don't know. Did you
bring cleaning products?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.863
- [Chuckles]
- [Sighs]

03:27.864 --> 03:29.122
[Doorbell rings]

03:29.123 --> 03:31.475
Well, the response to the
Brick babysitting sweepstakes

03:31.476 --> 03:34.404
was not great, so I had
to take what I could get.

03:34.405 --> 03:36.726
Good eventide, Brick.

03:36.727 --> 03:38.623
I'm the first shift here to watch you.

03:38.624 --> 03:39.850
Okay.

03:39.851 --> 03:41.593
[Dog barking in distance]

03:42.942 --> 03:44.390
I didn't know what you liked to do,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.660
so I brought some toys from my childhood...

03:46.661 --> 03:49.045
a block of wood and a rock.

03:52.005 --> 03:54.851
Are you hungry? If you
show me to your hatchery,

03:54.852 --> 03:56.475
I could strangle us a chicken for dinner.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.604
No, thanks. I just had a pizza pocket.

04:02.771 --> 04:03.995
What's this?

04:03.996 --> 04:06.034
They're making us build a car for science.

04:06.035 --> 04:09.340
At this point, I'm looking
down the barrel of an "F."

04:09.341 --> 04:10.940
Hmm. May I have a go?

04:10.941 --> 04:13.508
I've watched our smithy
change many a buggy wheel.

04:13.509 --> 04:14.605
Hmm.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.423
- Help yourself.
- Oh, no.

04:19.423 --> 04:20.730
I'm not allowed to have that.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.075
But may I trouble you for a bowl of wheat?

04:25.268 --> 04:27.827
It was really nice of
Rosalie to let us stay here.

04:27.828 --> 04:29.782
How exactly are we related to her again?

04:29.783 --> 04:31.293
Eh, she might be an aunt,

04:31.294 --> 04:34.213
maybe just one of those
people you call an aunt.

04:34.214 --> 04:36.975
Anyway, she's always at
the funerals. I know that.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.791
- [Cellphone ringing]
- [Sighs]

04:41.047 --> 04:42.916
- [Beep]
- Hey.

04:42.917 --> 04:46.130
- Hey. How's it going there?
- Uh, okay.

04:46.131 --> 04:48.921
The tour was fine. A
lot of annoying parents.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.242
Annoying to you, or
annoying to other people?

04:51.243 --> 04:53.417
[Chuckles] No, there was one guy,

04:53.418 --> 04:56.097
"super daddy pancakes,"
who wouldn't shut up.

04:56.098 --> 04:57.922
He drove me nuts.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.369
Super daddy pancakes?

04:59.370 --> 05:01.026
Yeah, you know, remember the guy

05:01.027 --> 05:03.762
that we hated at the thing
last year? Just way too into it.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.970
At a certain age, you should stop

05:05.971 --> 05:08.146
being excited about life... all I'm saying.

05:08.147 --> 05:11.556
Hey, you are never gonna
believe where I am. I'm at Axl's.

05:11.557 --> 05:15.497
Axl's coach is putting him
in. He's actually playing.

05:15.498 --> 05:16.787
You're kidding me! That's great!

05:16.788 --> 05:18.123
So, what did he say?

05:18.124 --> 05:19.875
- When's he putting him in?
- Tomorrow.

05:19.876 --> 05:21.868
- W... tomorrow?
- Yeah, that's the bad news.

05:21.869 --> 05:23.695
- You're not gonna be here.
- What? No way.

05:23.696 --> 05:25.093
I got to be there. Come on.

05:25.094 --> 05:28.303
We can meet at a Stuckey's
and swap the kids.

05:28.304 --> 05:31.461
Mike, you know how excited Sue
is to be on that trip with you.

05:31.462 --> 05:32.886
She didn't hear you say that, did she?

05:32.887 --> 05:35.971
No, she's got headphones in.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.358
Listen, she falls asleep,

05:38.359 --> 05:39.982
I throw a pillowcase over her head,

05:39.983 --> 05:41.396
we make the switch in
the middle of the night,

05:41.397 --> 05:42.531
and nobody's the wiser.

05:42.532 --> 05:43.555
Nice try.

05:43.556 --> 05:46.112
[Muffled] I got to go.
I got a big day tomorrow.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.706
Yeah, my big day is what you have.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.414
Mm-hmm. Bye.

05:50.415 --> 05:53.774
[Beep] Hey, dad...

05:53.775 --> 05:56.374
Why do you think the tour guide
gave me all these brochures?

05:56.375 --> 05:58.677
There's a cherokee weaving workshop,

05:58.678 --> 06:02.082
and here's one on the headdress
exhibit at the art museum.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.995
Hmm, that's weird. They didn't
give that stuff to anybody else?

06:04.996 --> 06:06.557
- Mnh-mnh.
- I don't know.

06:06.558 --> 06:09.552
- It's not like you're native American.
- Yes, I am.

06:09.553 --> 06:12.430
N-no, Sue. You're not.

06:12.431 --> 06:15.518
Sure, I am. I mean, that's
what I put on my forms.

06:15.519 --> 06:16.957
What? Why did you do that?

06:16.958 --> 06:21.982
'Cause I'm a native of
America. I'm a native American.

06:21.983 --> 06:24.503
Sue, now they think you're native American!

06:24.504 --> 06:27.534
Right, a native American.

06:27.535 --> 06:30.037
[Sighs] Say, "I'm a native American."

06:30.038 --> 06:31.652
I'm a native American.

06:31.653 --> 06:33.845
Ohh! I hear it now.

06:33.846 --> 06:36.372
Well, what was I supposed to check?

06:36.373 --> 06:38.436
There was no other
option that seemed right.

06:38.437 --> 06:40.692
It's not like we're
"ca-kah-zee-an."

06:40.693 --> 06:42.756
Actually, Sue, we are.

06:42.757 --> 06:43.861
What?!

06:43.862 --> 06:46.805
Oh, my God, this is horrible!

06:46.806 --> 06:49.052
They're gonna think that I
tried to pull one over on them,

06:49.053 --> 06:51.332
that I lied on my forms,

06:51.333 --> 06:53.356
and it says it's a felony
to lie on those forms.

06:53.357 --> 06:54.957
Oh, my God! I committed a felony!

06:54.958 --> 06:56.613
[Gasps]

06:58.026 --> 06:59.118
[Music box plays]

06:59.119 --> 07:00.854
[Vomits]

07:07.624 --> 07:09.521
Whoo! Yeah, Dragons!

07:09.522 --> 07:12.083
Oh, is your son playing?

07:12.084 --> 07:13.138
Mine, too.

07:13.139 --> 07:14.802
He's right over there... the cute one.

07:14.803 --> 07:16.754
No, they're all cute. I'm not like that.

07:16.755 --> 07:17.771
[Chuckles]

07:17.772 --> 07:19.940
Oh, I think he's going in. [Gasps]

07:19.941 --> 07:23.646
Announcer: Now entering the
game, number 37, Axl Heck.

07:23.647 --> 07:27.045
- Whoo-hoo! Axl! Go Axl!
- [Whistle blows]

07:28.834 --> 07:30.460
[All grunting]

07:30.461 --> 07:32.937
[All groan]

07:32.938 --> 07:35.849
Announcer: Now leaving the game, number 37,

07:35.850 --> 07:38.028
Axl Heck. [Booing]

07:38.029 --> 07:40.409
[Chuckles] Gee, I wonder when
they're gonna put my son in.

07:42.865 --> 07:44.994
Hi, gang. Welcome to Butler.

07:44.995 --> 07:47.587
I can't wait to tell you all
about our beautiful campus.

07:47.588 --> 07:49.074
Oh. Okay, yes.

07:49.075 --> 07:53.017
Hi. I just wanted to say
that I am white... all white.

07:53.018 --> 07:55.507
So I'm only interested
in clubs for white people

07:55.508 --> 07:57.555
or art made by only white people...

07:57.556 --> 08:00.297
not native Americans, because
I'm definitely not that.

08:00.298 --> 08:03.229
So please don't show me anything
or talk to me about anything

08:03.230 --> 08:05.731
that is not exclusively for white people.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.081
Well, that school was a little
out of our price range, anyway.

08:11.082 --> 08:12.398
I just didn't want people to think

08:12.399 --> 08:15.932
that I lied on my application
or that I was a liar in any way.

08:15.933 --> 08:17.947
I just wanted to make it clear what I was.

08:19.138 --> 08:21.387
Oh, I think you made it very clear.

08:24.682 --> 08:26.506
[Door opens, closes]

08:26.507 --> 08:28.891
The Chuck is here.

08:28.892 --> 08:30.857
The fun starts now, baby Mike.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.938
My mom asked you to watch me?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.818
Not exactly. She asked
Dave, 'cause he's a dad.

08:35.818 --> 08:38.124
But he had dad stuff to
do, so the Chuck stepped in.

08:38.125 --> 08:41.655
The Chuck likes to keep
his schedule wide open

08:41.657 --> 08:43.273
for all kinds of "life-ortunities."

08:45.571 --> 08:48.168
You don't mind if I drum while you
do your baby Mike thing, do you?

08:48.169 --> 08:50.186
I bring these
with me everywhere I go.

08:50.187 --> 08:51.760
Mm. How long have you been playing?

08:51.761 --> 08:53.184
Since today.

08:53.185 --> 08:54.905
What you working on?

08:54.906 --> 08:56.088
Science project.

08:56.089 --> 08:58.866
Oh, school? More like prison of your mind.

08:58.867 --> 09:01.287
The day they told me I had
to wear a shirt in class,

09:01.288 --> 09:03.791
that was it. They just want
to turn you into a robot,

09:03.792 --> 09:05.087
get you to work for the man.

09:05.088 --> 09:07.543
Don't you work for the man?

09:07.544 --> 09:09.607
Only until I get my jet ski paid off.

09:09.608 --> 09:12.553
Then I'm riding the river
all the way to the Gulf.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.059
There's no river that goes
from Orson to any Gulf.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.356
That's just your schooling talking to ya.

09:19.357 --> 09:21.263
Yes, it is.

09:21.264 --> 09:23.118
Yes, it is.

09:28.004 --> 09:31.174
Welcome to Ball State,
guys. My name is Marcus.

09:31.175 --> 09:32.442
I'm a junior.

09:32.443 --> 09:34.996
- I'm also on the cheerleading squad.
- Coming through. Sorry we're late.

09:34.997 --> 09:36.145
[Chuckles]

09:36.146 --> 09:38.442
- Hey, tall guy from Orson.
- How you doing?

09:38.443 --> 09:40.507
Good. Well, you know, every
day you spend with your kids

09:40.508 --> 09:41.895
is a blessing. Am I right?

09:41.896 --> 09:43.693
Great. Glad everyone's here.

09:43.694 --> 09:47.216
So, let's figure out which of
you came the longest distance.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.550
Man: Cincinnati.

09:48.551 --> 09:49.565
Woman: Milwaukee!

09:49.566 --> 09:51.095
Well, we didn't come from far away,

09:51.096 --> 09:52.586
but Maddie and I have this great book

09:52.587 --> 09:54.362
of old-timey
ice-cream parlors,

09:54.363 --> 09:55.890
and we've been trying to visit them all

09:55.891 --> 09:57.594
- and check them off the list.
- [Sighs]

09:57.595 --> 09:59.269
So if you tally up the miles...

09:59.270 --> 10:01.174
He asked for the longest distance,

10:01.175 --> 10:03.663
not the longest answer. [Chuckles]

10:03.664 --> 10:05.142
Ha! We kind of know each other.

10:07.367 --> 10:09.297
Come on, Axl. It wasn't that bad.

10:09.298 --> 10:11.550
You're just focused on it
'cause it happened to you.

10:11.551 --> 10:13.087
Could we please not talk about it, please?

10:13.088 --> 10:14.205
Fine, fine, fine.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.323
I won't talk. Let me just hold you.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.771
Y-you know what made me mad

10:18.772 --> 10:20.221
is that the coach didn't
put you back in again

10:20.222 --> 10:21.626
so you could redeem yourself.

10:21.627 --> 10:23.101
Because after you dropped the ball,

10:23.102 --> 10:24.439
the other team got so far ahead,

10:24.440 --> 10:25.529
it really wouldn't have mattered.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.516
It's just that you're usually so good.

10:27.517 --> 10:30.202
I don't know. It seems like
you took your eye off the ball.

10:30.203 --> 10:31.777
Did the coach tell you to do that?

10:31.778 --> 10:33.951
Yes, that's what he told me to do. [Scoffs]

10:34.398 --> 10:37.107
I don't know if this will
help, but I have it on my phone.

10:37.108 --> 10:40.344
It's like game film. That's a thing, right?

10:41.237 --> 10:43.450
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like here.

10:43.451 --> 10:46.409
Now, could you have
picked up the ball again

10:46.410 --> 10:49.258
and... and run with it, or
is that against the rules?

10:49.259 --> 10:52.021
'Cause... 'cause it looks
like after you dropped it,

10:52.022 --> 10:53.498
you just kind of stood there.

10:53.499 --> 10:55.113
Oh, my God! Make it stop!

10:59.519 --> 11:01.427
He fumbled on the goal line?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.843
Yep. Played for a total of 9 seconds.

11:03.844 --> 11:07.220
- Oh, damn.
- I know, and he's in a really bad place.

11:07.221 --> 11:08.665
I mean, I've been trying to explain to him

11:08.666 --> 11:10.463
that it's really not that
big a deal and, you know,

11:10.464 --> 11:13.219
probably in like 10 or 20
years, no one will remember,

11:13.220 --> 11:14.926
but he just keeps telling
me to leave him alone.

11:14.927 --> 11:16.300
Well, then leave him alone.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.185
Guys don't like talking
about stuff like that.

11:18.186 --> 11:20.523
I didn't talk to him the whole time.

11:20.524 --> 11:23.944
I mostly tried to be quiet
and, you know, just hold him.

11:23.945 --> 11:26.830
- Oh, man.
- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

11:27.584 --> 11:30.315
- How are things with Sue?
- Uh... Fine.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.868
She's... she's... she's in the bathroom

11:31.869 --> 11:33.532
kind of crying or something.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.601
Crying? Why is she crying?

11:35.602 --> 11:37.377
I don't know. Something about a tray.

11:37.378 --> 11:40.898
Stupid remote. Why don't
they make them all the same?

11:40.899 --> 11:43.425
- A tray? What tray?
- I don't know!

11:43.426 --> 11:45.001
You now know as much as I do.

11:45.002 --> 11:47.528
Sh-sh-she closed the door and
doesn't want to talk about it.

11:47.529 --> 11:50.087
What about a closed door makes
you think she doesn't want to talk?

11:50.088 --> 11:52.536
A closed door means she wants to talk.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.712
[Groans]

11:53.713 --> 11:55.968
Well, clearly, we each have the wrong kid.

11:55.969 --> 11:57.378
[Sighs]

12:00.576 --> 12:03.337
Sue, you... you want to talk?

12:03.338 --> 12:05.257
Or are you doing business in there?

12:08.705 --> 12:10.695
I put the litter box back in the tub.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.291
[Sniffles, sighs] So, how
do we know Trudy again?

12:13.292 --> 12:16.250
She's saving us 80 bucks.
That's how we know Trudy.

12:16.251 --> 12:21.734
So... Something about a tray or something?

12:21.735 --> 12:23.811
Oh, dad, it was horrible.

12:23.812 --> 12:26.914
Remember when we went to
the cafeteria for a snack?

12:26.915 --> 12:29.835
Well, I grabbed a tray,
and... and the woman said

12:29.836 --> 12:32.355
I was in the wrong place
and I had the wrong tray,

12:32.356 --> 12:34.851
and she just kept asking me,
"what's your dining plan?"

12:34.852 --> 12:37.491
And I didn't know what to do, so
I just dropped the tray and ran.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.132
So, Ball State is out.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.514
- That's fine.
- No!

12:44.515 --> 12:47.270
Dad, that's not it. Don't you see?

12:47.271 --> 12:49.478
How am I gonna do well in college

12:49.479 --> 12:52.734
if I can't even master
the cafeteria or the tours

12:52.735 --> 12:55.950
or ask any questions without
creating a racial incident?

12:55.951 --> 12:59.054
Maybe I'm not ready to
be away from you and mom.

12:59.055 --> 13:01.192
Maybe I'm not ready for college.

13:03.112 --> 13:05.320
Well, you know...

13:05.321 --> 13:07.061
It'll be better in the morning.

13:07.062 --> 13:08.916
[Clears throat]

13:13.821 --> 13:16.017
[Whirring]

13:16.018 --> 13:17.835
Aww, there's my big sleeper.

13:17.836 --> 13:19.770
How about you buy your mom some breakfast?

13:19.771 --> 13:22.466
I'll pay. I just want to stay home, okay?

13:22.467 --> 13:25.924
[Sighs] Axl, you can't hide
from your teammates forever.

13:25.925 --> 13:27.778
[Scoffs] It's not about that.

13:27.779 --> 13:30.431
- Well, what is it about, then?
- [Sighs]

13:30.432 --> 13:32.873
N-never mind. We don't
have to talk about it.

13:32.874 --> 13:34.937
You stay... I'll run and
grab us some breakfast

13:34.938 --> 13:37.505
and maybe pee somewhere with a toilet seat.

13:37.506 --> 13:38.543
Fine.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.027
[Sighs deeply]

13:42.241 --> 13:43.918
I invited Devin Levin to the game.

13:43.919 --> 13:46.493
[Gasps] I knew it! You like her!

13:46.494 --> 13:48.550
Oh, my God. Stop smiling. I knew
I shouldn't have said anything.

13:48.551 --> 13:50.948
No. It's fine. Go on. I won't smile.

13:50.949 --> 13:53.355
She was at the game.
She saw what I did. I...

13:53.356 --> 13:55.268
[sighs] There's no coming back from that.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.660
Now I just got to make sure
I never see her ever again...

13:57.661 --> 13:58.721
ever.

13:59.972 --> 14:03.170
Axl, you're both on the same campus.

14:03.171 --> 14:04.731
You're gonna run into her eventually.

14:04.732 --> 14:06.083
No. I figured it out.

14:06.084 --> 14:08.075
I just have to skip all
my Wednesday classes,

14:08.076 --> 14:09.727
scurry along the rooftop to econ,

14:09.728 --> 14:11.438
and change my major to nursing.

14:11.439 --> 14:13.878
Come on, Axl. I-I may not
know much about football.

14:13.879 --> 14:16.414
But here's the good news.
I do know about women.

14:16.415 --> 14:18.614
God, now I've really hit rock bottom.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.191
I'm getting dating advice from my mom.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.703
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

14:21.704 --> 14:24.406
We know you guys aren't perfect.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.783
Uh, take me... I married a man

14:26.784 --> 14:30.343
with all the sensitivity
of an Easter Island statue.

14:30.344 --> 14:32.526
Guess what. I love him anyway.

14:32.527 --> 14:35.246
Ugh. I do not want to hear about
my parents loving each other.

14:35.247 --> 14:37.438
I'm just saying, you make a mistake,

14:37.439 --> 14:40.622
you got to own it. Show her
that it doesn't faze you.

14:40.623 --> 14:43.109
Believe me... there's nothing
more attractive to a girl

14:43.110 --> 14:44.629
than a guy who's confident.

14:44.630 --> 14:47.590
But a guy who's sneaking
around trying to avoid her...

14:47.591 --> 14:48.943
not so much.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.303
Is it okay that I have
my hand here for a minute?

14:54.415 --> 14:55.677
It's okay.

14:55.678 --> 14:57.432
Hmm.

14:57.433 --> 15:01.277
Are we all together? Okay, great.

15:01.278 --> 15:04.670
And this brings us back to the dining hall.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.440
Before you all go in and have lunch,

15:06.441 --> 15:08.131
does anybody have any questions?

15:08.132 --> 15:10.195
Mm...

15:12.420 --> 15:13.617
Yes?

15:13.618 --> 15:17.867
So, if you were starting
over as a freshman,

15:17.868 --> 15:20.562
is there anything you wish you had known?

15:20.563 --> 15:23.425
Hmm. Now, that's an excellent question.

15:23.426 --> 15:25.529
Well, I wish I would have known

15:25.530 --> 15:27.379
that the blue trays were for visitors

15:27.380 --> 15:29.292
and the red trays were for
meal plans, I'll tell you that.

15:29.293 --> 15:31.253
Really.

15:33.689 --> 15:37.205
Dad, I am gonna go get some college food.

15:37.206 --> 15:39.870
- Do you want any?
- No, I'm good. You go ahead.

15:39.871 --> 15:41.067
Okay.

15:41.068 --> 15:43.461
[Indistinct conversations]

15:49.440 --> 15:51.452
- Can you believe it?
- Mm.

15:51.453 --> 15:53.880
How are we gonna fill the
hours when they're gone, huh?

15:53.881 --> 15:54.947
[Sighs]

15:54.948 --> 15:56.397
Soon, all we'll have are memories

15:56.398 --> 15:58.789
of those Sunday-night
daddy/daughter dates,

15:58.790 --> 16:03.413
the Teddy-bear picnics, the
scavenger hunts in the backyard.

16:03.414 --> 16:05.007
Mm.

16:05.008 --> 16:07.379
But, hey, it's the memories
that sustain us. Am I right?

16:07.380 --> 16:10.902
Not really. My son's at East Indiana state.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.830
And he's always home. They
got a lot of vacation days.

16:15.630 --> 16:18.007
I'm just saying. You got
to savor every moment.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.934
Like, a couple of months ago,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.967
Maddie was going to her homecoming dance,

16:21.968 --> 16:24.375
and she wanted to borrow
my red mustang convertible.

16:24.376 --> 16:27.266
- I mean, that car is my pride and joy.
- Hmm.

16:27.267 --> 16:31.185
But the morning of the dance,
I washed it, cleaned the tires,

16:31.186 --> 16:35.179
and polished the leather...
had that thing shining like new.

16:36.677 --> 16:39.315
Before she left for the
night, I took a picture of her

16:39.316 --> 16:41.260
in her homecoming dress,
standing in front of it.

16:42.652 --> 16:44.003
Well, here's the thing.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.508
Later, when I looked at that picture,

16:46.509 --> 16:50.773
all I could see was her
and... how much time had gone.

16:53.525 --> 16:55.205
Didn't even see the car.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

17:08.413 --> 17:11.424
Now, remember, when it comes
to glitter, more is more.

17:11.425 --> 17:14.362
A-a-a-nd... Done!

17:14.363 --> 17:16.954
That's fine, but it still doesn't go.

17:16.955 --> 17:19.752
With what? Glitter is a
neutral. It goes with everything.

17:19.753 --> 17:22.582
No, I heard it has something to
do with rubber bands and tension.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.493
Okay, well, whenever I
have a big job ahead of me,

17:25.494 --> 17:27.630
I just imagine the montage
of what I would have done

17:27.631 --> 17:29.246
to finish it and work backwards.

17:29.247 --> 17:31.766
Like, first, we'd flick
paint on each other and laugh.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.792
Then you'd hand me a
hammer to use on the car,

17:33.793 --> 17:36.527
but then we reveal that I'm
using it to crack walnuts.

17:36.528 --> 17:38.175
Then we'd get mad at each other.

17:38.176 --> 17:40.974
I'd blow my hair out of my
eyes in frustration. [Blows]

17:40.975 --> 17:43.487
And at some point, we're in front of
a mirror, trying on different hats.

17:43.488 --> 17:46.013
Finally, we slump to
the ground, back-to-back,

17:46.014 --> 17:48.305
exhausted after a job well done.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.704
I'm a dead man.

17:52.751 --> 17:55.475
Hey, Axl? I put your sheets back upsta...

17:55.476 --> 17:57.814
Hey, Devin. It's Axl.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.494
[Chuckles] That's cool.

18:00.495 --> 18:04.678
Um, you know, just chillin'. [Chuckles]

18:04.679 --> 18:07.815
So, uh, did you do
anything exciting yesterday?

18:07.816 --> 18:09.175
Devin: Well, I went to a football game.

18:09.176 --> 18:11.864
It didn't end that well, though.
Somebody blew a simple hand-off.

18:11.865 --> 18:13.090
[Chuckles] What are you talking about?

18:13.091 --> 18:15.869
I dedicated that fumble to you.
What did you want? A touchdown?

18:15.870 --> 18:18.381
I thought you were
different from other girls.

18:18.382 --> 18:21.122
[Chuckles] Where was
that hustle on the field?

18:21.123 --> 18:24.208
- Good one.
- [Frankie squeals, chuckles]

18:24.209 --> 18:27.155
So, what are you doing
now? You want to, like,

18:27.156 --> 18:28.588
maybe grab some food or something?

18:28.589 --> 18:31.956
Yeah, I know that place. All right.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.401
Okay, I finished my list of pros and cons.

18:36.402 --> 18:40.497
I have 75 pros and 86 super-pros.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.772
I don't have any cons, 'cause it just seems

18:42.773 --> 18:45.218
so negative, and they all tried so hard.

18:45.219 --> 18:46.994
- Hmm.
- And, you know, dad,

18:46.995 --> 18:49.488
I read that brochure about
native American studies,

18:49.489 --> 18:52.215
and it actually seems super-interesting.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.695
I think I might even minor in it, hmm?

18:54.696 --> 18:56.288
And it'd be perfect for me,

18:56.289 --> 18:59.592
because I just love America so much.

19:02.639 --> 19:04.991
- [Yawning] Night, dad.
- Good night.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.197
[Sighs]

19:13.132 --> 19:15.113
- Hey, Sue.
- Hmm?

19:15.114 --> 19:17.261
You ever feel bad that I never...

19:18.362 --> 19:21.146
You know, made you super daddy pancakes?

19:21.147 --> 19:23.113
No. Why?

19:23.114 --> 19:25.052
Well, I don't know. That...

19:25.053 --> 19:29.595
that guy and his daughter are
always doing stuff together.

19:29.596 --> 19:33.979
Did you ever wish I was,
you know, more like him?

19:33.980 --> 19:36.711
Wha... dad, no.

19:36.712 --> 19:38.655
Why would you even say that?

19:38.656 --> 19:41.119
You're amazing. My whole life,

19:41.120 --> 19:43.543
you made sure my bike tires were pumped up.

19:43.544 --> 19:46.816
You let me ride on your shoulders
when I cleaned out the gutter.

19:46.817 --> 19:49.743
Whenever mom yells, "I
just can't do it anymore,"

19:49.744 --> 19:51.560
you make my lunch for a few days.

19:51.561 --> 19:56.080
And best of all, when you find
a pretty rock at the quarry,

19:56.081 --> 19:58.276
you always bring it home for me.

19:58.277 --> 20:02.671
I mean, come on. Nobody
else's dad does that.

20:02.672 --> 20:05.550
You're the greatest dad in the whole world.

20:05.551 --> 20:10.023
Hello? That's why I got you the
mug... "world's greatest dad."

20:10.024 --> 20:11.776
Mugs don't lie.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.532
You remember all that stuff?

20:15.533 --> 20:19.683
Of course. I don't want
some bouncy, pancake dad.

20:19.684 --> 20:23.020
If I did, it wouldn't be you.

20:25.678 --> 20:27.395
Sometimes as a parent,

20:27.396 --> 20:29.491
it's easy to think you're not doing enough.

20:34.164 --> 20:35.484
But the truth is,

20:35.485 --> 20:37.982
it's the little things you do along the way

20:37.983 --> 20:40.044
that end up being the big things.

20:58.993 --> 21:02.282
All right, Brick, you're
up next. Let's see it.

21:13.365 --> 21:15.112
[Students cheering]

21:15.113 --> 21:17.702
Yep, Brick's car went farther
than any other car that day.

21:17.703 --> 21:20.702
It's true what they
say. It takes a village.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.528
Of course, in this case,

21:22.529 --> 21:24.530
none of the villagers were Brick.
