00:32.325 --> 00:36.307

00:36.375 --> 00:38.699
- It's Connolly's
and the bakery.

00:38.767 --> 00:41.529
<i>...And they're coming
awful fast</i>

00:41.597 --> 00:42.839
- Lovely.

<i>We're a long, long way

00:54.656 --> 00:56.061
- Good morning, Mr. Dooley.
- Morning, boys.

00:58.812 --> 01:00.450
Morning, Marvin.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.101
- Hey, Jackie.
Just a sec.

01:04.169 --> 01:06.277
- Moira...

01:06.345 --> 01:08.253
As I live and breathe.

01:08.321 --> 01:10.629
- Hello, Mr. Dooley.

01:10.697 --> 01:13.242
- I need a hug.

01:17.561 --> 01:18.597
- I've missed you.

01:18.665 --> 01:20.739
- Oh, we missed you too.

01:20.807 --> 01:22.780
That old office
just isn't the same.

01:22.847 --> 01:25.024
- Well, I could come back.
I can still do afternoons.

01:25.092 --> 01:27.533
- No, no, no, it's all right.
It's all right, darling.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.341
I'm getting
her groceries today.

01:29.408 --> 01:30.579
- Oh, no, Mr. Dooley.

01:30.646 --> 01:32.420
- Thanks, Mr. Dooley.

01:32.487 --> 01:33.756
- Think nothing of it.

01:33.824 --> 01:36.999
You don't take care
of your own, who will, huh?

01:37.067 --> 01:40.208
- Hey, I-I called
your office yesterday.

01:40.275 --> 01:42.180
- Oh, yes.

01:42.248 --> 01:44.687
I meant to call you back.

01:44.755 --> 01:47.932
- I just thought
if you needed me for anything,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.902
I'm good now.

01:49.972 --> 01:53.714
I'm clean, I swear.

01:53.782 --> 01:57.625
- Well, that's
wonderful news, Edward.

01:57.693 --> 02:00.133
But you take care
of your mother.

02:00.201 --> 02:02.105
I've got my eye on you.

02:02.173 --> 02:04.644
- Thank you, Mr. Dooley.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.160
- Well, detective,

02:10.228 --> 02:11.930
what a pleasure it is
to see you

02:12.000 --> 02:15.007
taking the time to grace us
here in Broad Channel.

02:15.074 --> 02:16.743
- Listen to me.

02:16.811 --> 02:19.751
<i>We're a long, long way
from nowhere </i>

02:19.819 --> 02:22.591
<i>With a long,

02:22.658 --> 02:24.629
<i>Where these black tides</i>

02:24.697 --> 02:28.672
<i>have carried me before</i>

02:28.739 --> 02:30.209
- Who you taking down?

02:30.277 --> 02:31.745
- The russian.

02:31.813 --> 02:33.149
- Valeyev?

02:33.217 --> 02:34.686
I thought he was good people.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.356
- Not today.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.726
- You want a hand?

02:37.793 --> 02:39.663
- Nah, get some rest.

02:39.731 --> 02:42.804
<i>They say a wise man
falls for nothing </i>

02:42.871 --> 02:46.512
<i>But I haven't met one yet </i>

02:46.580 --> 02:49.017
<i>Boatloads full
of broken fools</i>

02:49.085 --> 02:51.523
<i>And the stumbles
they regret</i>

02:51.590 --> 02:54.763
<i>Oh, we're all just cuts
and bruises</i>

02:54.831 --> 02:58.003
<i>Yeah, we're only guts
and bones</i>

02:58.072 --> 03:00.543
<i>Busted hulls and gunwales</i>

03:00.611 --> 03:03.449
<i>Trying to find
our way back home </i>

03:03.516 --> 03:06.288
<i>We're a long, long way

03:06.356 --> 03:09.594

<i>Where these black tides</i>

03:11.399 --> 03:14.404
<i>Have carried me before</i>

03:16.809 --> 03:17.744
Get him, Jay.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.054
- You've got the right
to remain silent, sport.

03:23.122 --> 03:26.194
I suggest you use it.

03:26.262 --> 03:27.529
Nice guy, huh?

03:27.597 --> 03:29.099
What's your question?

03:29.167 --> 03:31.303
<i>We're a long, long way
from nowhere</i>

03:31.371 --> 03:34.809

<i>It's the middle

We get snow, we're gonna
lose anything on the ground

04:39.134 --> 04:40.434
in about two minutes.

04:40.435 --> 04:41.735
Tell them to back up.

04:41.821 --> 04:43.487
- I'm looking
at a tide chart.

04:43.555 --> 04:44.922
We've got about 45 minutes

04:44.990 --> 04:47.491
before a lot of this crime scene
is underwater.

04:47.559 --> 04:48.826
- Well, blood spatter

04:48.894 --> 04:51.728
indicates he was shot
from inside the car.

04:51.796 --> 04:53.096
Took four shots.

04:53.163 --> 04:54.964
Kevlar stopped three.

04:55.032 --> 04:56.432
Tried to flee.

04:56.499 --> 04:57.933
Took one
in the back of the head

04:58.001 --> 04:59.434
on his way
out of the vehicle.

04:59.502 --> 05:01.169
- Well, he never got
his gun out.

05:01.237 --> 05:04.438
- The body was partially
immersed in seawater.

05:04.506 --> 05:05.940
Liver temp's no good.

05:06.007 --> 05:08.476
Have to determine
T.O.D. at the lab.

05:08.543 --> 05:10.944
- What was he doing out here,
meeting somebody?

05:11.012 --> 05:12.712
- Maybe an informant.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.315
- Mm.
We got a shoe print.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.318
Look at that. Three inches
from the high-tide line.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.719
Somebody loves us.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.525
- No, Your Honor...

05:27.592 --> 05:28.792
Yes, sir.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.294
Yes, if you could just hold
one moment, sir.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.262
Yes, sir, I can confirm.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.998
I'm holding his I.D.
It's detective Ryan Fields.

05:37.066 --> 05:41.336
[indistinct police
radio chatter, sirens wail]

05:41.403 --> 05:42.737
- Oh, no.

05:42.805 --> 05:45.805
- What the hell
was he doing here?

05:45.873 --> 05:48.173
- Did you know him?
- Yeah.

05:48.241 --> 05:50.576
- Mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

05:50.643 --> 05:52.777
- Just give us a moment, please.
This is our friend.

05:52.845 --> 05:54.178
- Sure.

05:54.245 --> 05:56.480
- This has to be
one of the wettest,

05:56.548 --> 05:59.749
coldest places
that I've ever...

05:59.817 --> 06:01.717
You're from the 116 Queens?

06:01.785 --> 06:03.485
- Yeah.

06:03.553 --> 06:06.587
- Careful about, uh,
stepping on his blood.

06:06.654 --> 06:09.155
- Hey, you got
a problem, man?

06:09.223 --> 06:11.125
- Hey, come on,
come on, come on.

06:14.795 --> 06:17.764
- Welcome to Broad Channel.

06:17.831 --> 06:19.898
M.E. puts time of death

06:19.966 --> 06:21.700
between 2:00 and 3:00
last night.

06:21.768 --> 06:22.934
Bullet fragments
are at ballistics.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.935
Shoe print
is likely a dead end...

06:25.003 --> 06:27.037
Size ten,
Nike Pegasus.

06:27.105 --> 06:29.273
In Queens, they sell thousands
of that exact shoe.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.508
- Yeah, well, LUDs say
he got a call on his cell

06:31.575 --> 06:34.911
from a pay phone four blocks
from the scene at 1:40 A.M.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.278
Unis are checking
security cameras

06:36.346 --> 06:38.547
and canvassing to see
if anyone saw the caller.

06:38.614 --> 06:40.115
- So we're thinking
that the shooter

06:40.182 --> 06:41.416
was in his car with him?

06:41.483 --> 06:43.284
- Seems so.

06:43.351 --> 06:45.852
- What the hell was he doing
in Broad Channel?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.454
- Nobody seems to know.

06:47.521 --> 06:48.988
- Could've been a setup?

06:49.056 --> 06:50.890
- Old-school
Irish neighborhood.

06:50.957 --> 06:53.325
No shortage of bad guys.

06:53.393 --> 06:55.960
Ross and I
had a few cases out there.

06:56.028 --> 06:58.562
Everybody knows everything
about everybody,

06:58.630 --> 06:59.630
but nobody talks.

06:59.698 --> 07:01.064
- Maybe it was
a jumpy informant.

07:01.132 --> 07:02.599
- I think
I remember Fields' name

07:02.666 --> 07:04.900
on a few witness lists
in I.A.B.

07:04.968 --> 07:05.934
I got to take this.

07:06.002 --> 07:07.368
Have you interviewed
the widow yet?

07:07.436 --> 07:08.369
- On our way there now.

07:08.437 --> 07:10.437
- Yeah, Callas...

07:12.073 --> 07:12.172
Did your husband
actually mention,

07:13.775 --> 07:13.874
uh, where he was going,

07:14.143 --> 07:16.244
or who he was meeting?

07:16.312 --> 07:17.612
- No, I'm sorry.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.214
I just saw him in the morning
before he left for work.

07:20.282 --> 07:22.782
He never said too much
about where he was going.

07:22.850 --> 07:24.919
- Hello.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.754
- Hi.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.523
Atwater. Queens.

07:29.591 --> 07:32.059
- Yes.

07:34.194 --> 07:35.761
- We interrupting?

07:35.829 --> 07:38.096
- I'm done.

07:38.164 --> 07:40.165
Cassie,
thank you for your time.

07:40.232 --> 07:41.766
I'll give you a call
in a couple hours.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.267
You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

07:43.335 --> 07:45.502
- Okay.
- Thank you.

07:51.075 --> 07:53.342
- So understandably,
everybody wants in,

07:53.410 --> 07:56.044
but the 116
is gonna handle this.

07:56.112 --> 07:58.046
You okay with that?

07:58.114 --> 08:00.215
- Actually, I'm not.

08:00.282 --> 08:01.883
- [scoffs]
okay.

08:01.950 --> 08:05.386
So we'll talk later.

08:05.454 --> 08:08.088
Have a nice day.

08:12.026 --> 08:14.327
- He was a cop.
He got threatened every day.

08:14.395 --> 08:15.895
- Yeah, sorry, I know.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.397
We have to ask
these questions.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.998
- Yeah, I already spoke
with our people.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.900
- Your people?
- From Ryan's precinct.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.236
You know, they know
how it works over here.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.404
They'll get his killer.

08:25.471 --> 08:26.738
- This is such a nice house.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.039
Is this...
is that the Caribbean?

08:29.107 --> 08:30.541
- It's Jamaica.

08:32.309 --> 08:35.910
- You have a place in,
in Jamaica?

08:35.979 --> 08:37.580
- What's your point?

08:37.647 --> 08:39.414
- Oh, I don't really
have a point.

08:39.482 --> 08:43.384
It's just, uh, geez, I've always
wanted a place in Jamaica.

08:43.452 --> 08:46.019
How much does
a place like that run?

08:46.087 --> 08:47.921
- It's a time-share.

08:47.989 --> 08:50.156
We don't own it.
- Uh, I see.

08:50.224 --> 08:51.324
- What are you suggesting?

08:51.392 --> 08:53.092
- Mrs. Fields, no one
is suggesting anything.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.760
- Well, it sounds
like he is.

08:54.828 --> 08:56.195
- My gosh, no, no.

08:56.263 --> 08:58.697
It's just a...
you know, a place in Jamaica...

08:58.765 --> 09:00.699
- Well, Ryan inherited
some income property

09:00.766 --> 09:02.367
when his father died.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.568
You know, we do okay.

09:03.635 --> 09:05.036
- How much?

09:05.103 --> 09:06.871
- How much what?

09:06.938 --> 09:08.739
- How much income property?

09:08.807 --> 09:10.874
- You know,
I get what you're saying,

09:10.942 --> 09:12.009
And I don't like it.

09:12.076 --> 09:13.610
- I'm not...
I'm not saying anything.

09:13.678 --> 09:17.713
- What you are implying
about my husband...

09:17.781 --> 09:20.550
Now, I want you both
to leave.

09:20.617 --> 09:23.280
I want you out of here.

09:26.884 --> 09:29.818
- Nicely done.

09:31.187 --> 09:33.021
- I understand
we have to coordinate

09:33.089 --> 09:34.389
with the precinct in Queens.

09:34.457 --> 09:36.591
Chief, I'm not new
to jurisdictional procedure.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.559
- It's in
everyone's interest...

09:38.627 --> 09:41.495
- And I replied affirmatively
in my email.

09:41.563 --> 09:43.930
- Captain, not...
not to raise any flag,

09:43.998 --> 09:46.432
But already you've got people
blundering around Broad Channel.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.200
- Hey, hang on a minute.

09:48.268 --> 09:50.836
Major Case detectives
do not blunder around.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.904
- Call that
a bad choice of words.

09:52.972 --> 09:55.740
But may I speak freely?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

09:55.807 --> 09:57.308
- Have you ever been
to Broad Channel?

09:57.375 --> 09:58.742
- Before today, no.

09:58.810 --> 10:00.911
- Well, Captain,
it's a different world.

10:00.978 --> 10:03.746
It's an island community...
one road in, one road out.

10:03.814 --> 10:06.749
People are different
out there.

10:06.817 --> 10:08.350
Now, I would bet
our shooter's on the island,

10:08.418 --> 10:10.052
But they're not gonna rat him
out to M.C.S.

10:10.119 --> 10:12.887
because to them,
you guys are aliens.

10:12.955 --> 10:14.822
- And you know this because?

10:14.890 --> 10:16.090
- I grew up there.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.758
Our precinct
has informants there.

10:17.826 --> 10:18.926
I have informants there.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.594
I'm pleading with you.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.596
I just got off the phone
with the widow in this case.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.264
Ten minutes
with your detectives,

10:24.331 --> 10:26.265
she's no longer cooperating.

10:26.333 --> 10:29.000
Let us handle Broad Channel.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.670
- When you have a sec.

10:32.737 --> 10:36.273
- If it's about Fields,
come on in.

10:36.341 --> 10:39.576
I think you know everyone.

10:39.644 --> 10:41.578
- We went through
Detective Fields' tax records.

10:41.646 --> 10:43.613
- And?

10:43.681 --> 10:45.948
Let's hear it.

10:46.016 --> 10:47.783
- He owned several buildings
in Queens,

10:47.851 --> 10:49.584
But rents have dropped.

10:49.652 --> 10:52.554
They've gone sharply
unprofitable recently.

10:52.621 --> 10:55.156
- It's possible that when
the economy was better,

10:55.223 --> 10:58.292
He was using those buildings
to mask income.

10:58.359 --> 11:01.494
- Income made how?

11:01.562 --> 11:03.229
- We're not yet ready
to say that.

11:03.297 --> 11:04.363
- Oh, sure you are.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.932
You're suggesting
that he was dirty.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.500
- No.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.801
Uh, but I'm suggesting

11:09.869 --> 11:12.236
That it's something
that we should look at.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.238
- He was having trouble
paying his bills,

11:14.306 --> 11:15.740
like half the city.

11:15.807 --> 11:17.207
- Detectives,

11:17.275 --> 11:19.076
You can look
at whatever you want,

11:19.143 --> 11:20.544
but you'll be sharing
information

11:20.611 --> 11:21.878
With the 116 in Queens.

11:21.946 --> 11:24.815
Understood?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.288
- I'll pull his file
from I.A.B.,

11:34.355 --> 11:35.489
But from here on out,

11:35.557 --> 11:37.324
you've got to coordinate
with Atwater.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.658
Clear?

11:44.498 --> 11:46.132
[knock on door]

11:46.200 --> 11:47.767
- Honey, it's me.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.602
Hey.

11:51.571 --> 11:55.208
I got you some soup
and your pills.

11:55.275 --> 11:57.543
- I'm not hungry.

11:57.611 --> 12:01.547
- Come on.
Here, take your pill.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.184
- This is my life...

12:05.252 --> 12:07.720
Soup and methadone.

12:10.323 --> 12:11.723
- Look,
I'll heat this up for you.

12:11.791 --> 12:13.058
You got to be strong.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.693
- For what?
- What?

12:15.761 --> 12:17.228
- For what?
- For your future.

12:17.296 --> 12:18.729
Jackie's gonna take care
of you now.

12:18.797 --> 12:20.063
I called him twice today.

12:20.131 --> 12:21.898
He's gonna take care of you
for what you did.

12:21.966 --> 12:23.366
- That's what he said?

12:23.434 --> 12:26.369
- You got to trust me, son.

12:29.473 --> 12:31.807
- He better.

12:45.059 --> 12:46.595
- Like your new office?

12:46.663 --> 12:47.830
- Very much.

12:47.898 --> 12:48.965
- [chuckles]

12:49.033 --> 12:51.136
Nice view, huh?
City hall?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.706
- How far is that,
you think?

12:53.773 --> 12:56.141
- Depends on how
you plan to get there.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.242
[chuckles]

12:58.310 --> 13:00.210
I need a favor...

13:00.278 --> 13:03.714
Fields' file.

13:03.781 --> 13:06.516
- Zo, no indictments
were ever brought against him.

13:06.584 --> 13:08.551
He's dead.

13:08.619 --> 13:10.386
Whatever he was into,

13:10.454 --> 13:14.558
Dead cops are hero cops.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.493
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

13:16.561 --> 13:18.228
You know you would have done
exactly the same thing.

13:18.295 --> 13:22.163
- Charles, the identity of our
shooter might be in that file.

13:22.231 --> 13:24.032
You want to make it
to City Hall,

13:24.099 --> 13:25.600
then let me give you a tip.

13:25.668 --> 13:27.135
You don't ever look reluctant

13:27.203 --> 13:30.205
to help me investigate
a cop killing.

13:33.243 --> 13:35.845
Fields was under investigation
at the time of his murder.

13:35.912 --> 13:37.413
And here's
an interesting tidbit.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.780
He had another cell phone,

13:38.848 --> 13:40.714
and there are
a large number of calls

13:40.782 --> 13:45.349
to and from someone
named Jackie Dooley.

13:47.018 --> 13:49.285
- I was wondering
when his name would come up.

13:49.353 --> 13:50.787
That son of a bitch.

13:50.855 --> 13:51.921
- You have history?

13:51.989 --> 13:54.590
- Yeah,
you could say that.

13:54.657 --> 13:55.891
- Spill.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.926
- He's an old-school
Irish boss.

13:57.994 --> 14:00.394
Pretty much
runs Broad Channel.

14:00.462 --> 14:03.630
Ross and I went after him,
uh, three or four times.

14:03.698 --> 14:04.865
- For what?

14:04.933 --> 14:07.200
- Extortion,
loan-sharking, fraud,

14:07.268 --> 14:10.569
and once for conspiracy
to commit murder.

14:10.637 --> 14:12.037
He's a one-stop shop.

14:12.104 --> 14:15.173
Just so you know, we never made
a damn thing stick.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.474
- Let's talk to him.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.576
- In Broad Channel?

14:23.048 --> 14:26.985
You know I can't say yes
to that, technically.

14:27.053 --> 14:28.921
- Understood.

14:37.565 --> 14:39.199
- All right, boys.
Listen up.

14:39.266 --> 14:41.233
Listen up, everybody.
Move to the center, here.

14:41.301 --> 14:43.435
Come on.
I got to talk to you.

14:43.503 --> 14:45.937
Okay.
Come on, Dolan, you too...

14:46.004 --> 14:47.137
Over here.

14:47.205 --> 14:49.005
Now, I've come here today

14:49.073 --> 14:51.138
with my beautiful
assistant, Melodie,

14:51.205 --> 14:53.272
to make an announcement

14:53.340 --> 14:56.074
about the scholarships to
the athletic camp this summer.

14:56.142 --> 14:57.109
Huh?

14:57.176 --> 15:00.445
[children cheering]

15:02.347 --> 15:04.614
Okay, here we go.

15:04.682 --> 15:06.552
These are the names.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.994
Oh, boys,
heads are gonna roll here,

15:10.061 --> 15:12.330
'cause it says here

15:12.397 --> 15:14.667
that you all
have scholarships.

15:14.735 --> 15:15.934
[children cheering]

15:16.002 --> 15:19.504
Huh? We'll see you all
in camp this summer.

15:19.572 --> 15:22.541
Now, here,
we got some T-shirts for you.

15:29.782 --> 15:31.315
How have you been?

15:31.383 --> 15:33.918
- [scoffs]

15:33.985 --> 15:35.719
Hi, Jackie.

15:37.555 --> 15:40.458
- I was so sorry to hear
about your old partner.

15:40.526 --> 15:43.727
Always had the greatest respect
for Captain Ross.

15:43.795 --> 15:45.161
I sent flowers, you know.

15:45.229 --> 15:46.462
- Flowers from you?

15:46.530 --> 15:49.264
I wouldn't consider that
a sign of respect.

15:49.332 --> 15:50.966
- And I don't call that
very gracious.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.434
- Tell us about Fields.

15:52.501 --> 15:54.102
- Oh, dear god.

15:54.169 --> 15:57.371
What a terrible thing
to happen here in Broad Channel.

15:57.439 --> 16:00.104
I mean, what sort of person
walking among us

16:00.172 --> 16:01.775
could do a brutal thing
like that?

16:01.842 --> 16:04.143
- The two of you
had 14 phone conversations

16:04.211 --> 16:05.278
In the last six weeks.

16:05.345 --> 16:06.445
- Is that right?
- Yep.

16:06.513 --> 16:09.547
- Sounds a bit high.
- We counted them.

16:09.615 --> 16:10.949
- I hope
you're not suggesting

16:11.016 --> 16:13.250
that I had any connection
with that tragic event...

16:13.318 --> 16:15.285
- 14 calls...
what did you guys talk about?

16:15.353 --> 16:17.120
- Because that
would be monstrous.

16:17.188 --> 16:18.955
- What subject
did you and Detective Fields

16:19.023 --> 16:20.623
Find so mutually interesting?

16:20.691 --> 16:22.791
- You know,
I shouldn't be shocked,

16:22.859 --> 16:24.793
But I am.

16:24.861 --> 16:28.796
It's a dark world
you must live in, my friend.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.264
Now, I don't believe
I have any obligation

16:31.332 --> 16:33.300
to speak to you
about this matter,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.969
but out of respect
for your late, lamented partner,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.803
I'll make an exception.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.639
I was, uh...

16:40.707 --> 16:43.075
How will I say it?

16:43.142 --> 16:46.410
Informing.

16:46.478 --> 16:48.312
- You were a C.I.
For fields?

16:48.380 --> 16:51.614
- That's such a nasty term...
so clinical.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.716
Now, you listen
to me, Nichols.

16:53.784 --> 16:56.351
There's many people out here
that want a piece

16:56.419 --> 16:58.119
of my lovely island.

16:58.187 --> 17:02.423
Jamaicans, Russians,
terrible sorts of folk.

17:02.491 --> 17:05.092
Uh, time to time,
I get a bit of news on them

17:05.160 --> 17:08.261
I don't mind passing along.

17:08.329 --> 17:10.864
Hmm?

17:10.931 --> 17:12.397
Now, if you don't mind,

17:12.465 --> 17:15.267
I'm gonna go cast off,
Lieutenant.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.036
- It's Detective.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.037
- Oh, yeah?

17:19.105 --> 17:22.507
I would have thought
you got promoted by now.

17:31.447 --> 17:34.748
- Coincidence your
arresting officer ended up dead?

17:34.816 --> 17:38.251
How well did you know
Detective Fields?

17:38.319 --> 17:41.157
- What do I get
if I tell you?

17:41.225 --> 17:43.425
- It depends
how well you knew him.

17:43.493 --> 17:45.360
- I paid him.

17:49.331 --> 17:50.598
- What for?

17:50.666 --> 17:53.400
- What do you think?

17:53.468 --> 17:56.870
- Right.

17:56.938 --> 17:59.973
So you paid him, but he,
but he still busted you?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.074
That doesn't sound like

18:01.142 --> 18:03.476
a very well thought-out
arrangement to me.

18:03.544 --> 18:06.411
- He was jacking us.

18:06.479 --> 18:09.581
- Oh, your payment
got raised.

18:09.649 --> 18:12.317
- Yeah.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.985
- And you refused?

18:14.052 --> 18:16.820
- I'm in here now.
What do you think?

18:16.888 --> 18:19.589
- Who else
was paying Fields?

18:19.657 --> 18:23.926
- In Queens?
Everybody.

18:23.993 --> 18:27.094
- Jackie Dooley?

18:27.162 --> 18:30.830
- Everybody.

18:30.898 --> 18:33.332
- All right,
that's motive.

18:33.399 --> 18:35.566
Dooley was getting jacked up
by Fields.

18:35.634 --> 18:37.001
- Yeah, but so was
everyone else.

18:37.068 --> 18:38.335
- But Dooley has means.

18:38.403 --> 18:40.137
He could have made that happen
in a heartbeat.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.604
- Not a chance.

18:41.672 --> 18:42.805
- Why?
[door buzzes]

18:42.873 --> 18:44.374
- Like you said,
Dooley's old school.

18:44.441 --> 18:46.108
They won't kill a cop.

18:46.176 --> 18:48.878
Look, I know you want him.
It's just not there.

18:48.946 --> 18:52.450
Let's see who else Fields
was jacking up.

18:52.517 --> 18:55.919
- His case files.

18:58.389 --> 18:59.856
- Detective Atwater.

18:59.924 --> 19:02.158
We want to see
Detective Fields' case log,

19:02.226 --> 19:04.827
Plus all the 61s he caught
over the past two years.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.228
- And that would be
for what reason?

19:06.295 --> 19:07.896
- We want to see
who's mad at him.

19:07.964 --> 19:10.031
- Oh, well, I hate to intrude
on your line of reasoning,

19:10.098 --> 19:12.399
But we already identified
our shooter over an hour ago.

19:12.467 --> 19:13.634
- Come again?
- How?

19:13.701 --> 19:15.035
- An informant
coughed him up.

19:15.102 --> 19:16.569
Eddie Boyle,
two-time loser.

19:16.637 --> 19:18.571
Fields busted him
for possession a few weeks ago.

19:18.639 --> 19:20.573
I guess he didn't want
to go back to jail.

19:20.641 --> 19:23.142
Warrant's gonna be here
any minute.

19:23.210 --> 19:24.510
You feel like
getting a coffee?

19:24.578 --> 19:26.311
- No, thanks.
I'm f--I'm fine.

19:26.379 --> 19:29.113
- I actually
wasn't asking you, sport,

19:29.181 --> 19:31.348
but you're welcome
to come along.

19:31.416 --> 19:33.417
Coffee, and then we're gonna
drive out to Broad Channel,

19:33.484 --> 19:34.617
find Eddie Boyle.

19:34.685 --> 19:37.520
- Sure.
That sounds nice.

19:44.994 --> 19:47.996
[tires screeching]

19:58.272 --> 20:00.172
- What's the matter?
- Mrs. Boyle.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.740
- I don't know.
- You got to let us in.

20:01.808 --> 20:03.174
- Still on Jackie Dooley?

20:03.242 --> 20:05.944
- What's Eddie Boyle
doing in Fields' car

20:06.011 --> 20:09.380
at 2:00 in the morning
with a gun?

20:09.448 --> 20:11.949
- Mrs. Boyle.

20:12.017 --> 20:13.350
He's not gonna be here.

20:13.418 --> 20:16.619
His mom's got him stashed
somewhere, if I know her.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.454
You got to let us in.

20:21.324 --> 20:23.225
- You can't come in here.

20:23.293 --> 20:24.693
- We got
Nike Pegasus shoes here.

20:24.761 --> 20:26.595
We got blood spatter.

20:35.499 --> 20:36.966
I don't have
to say anything to you.

20:36.934 --> 20:38.034
- Mrs. Boyle?

20:38.035 --> 20:39.135
- Jackie says I don't have
to tell you anything.

20:39.136 --> 20:40.836
- Can you wait a minute?
- I need to talk to Mr. Dooley.

20:40.902 --> 20:42.136
Put Mr. Dooley on.

20:42.137 --> 20:43.437
Don't tell me
that, Melodie.

20:43.504 --> 20:43.937
I need to...

20:45.205 --> 20:46.672
Oh, okay.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.008
Okay.
No, I'll, I'll hold.

20:50.076 --> 20:51.643
- Say, I...

20:51.711 --> 20:52.844
I know you.

20:52.912 --> 20:55.046
- Do you mind?
I'm on the phone.

20:55.114 --> 20:57.047
- No, I think I know you.
Where did we meet?

20:57.115 --> 20:58.082
Oh, oh, oh.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.650
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was in his office,

20:59.717 --> 21:01.718
Jackie's office.

21:01.786 --> 21:03.319
- So what?

21:03.387 --> 21:04.720
- You were his secretary.

21:04.788 --> 21:07.255
- None of your business
what I was.

21:07.323 --> 21:09.389
Oh, yeah, Jackie.
Hello.

21:09.456 --> 21:12.357
Yeah. Yeah.

21:12.425 --> 21:14.826
Yeah, that's what...

21:14.893 --> 21:18.362
[continues indistinctly]

21:18.430 --> 21:20.464
I know. I didn't want
to open the door.

21:20.532 --> 21:22.966
- Does that strike you
as significant at all,

21:23.034 --> 21:25.101
that the shooter's mother

21:25.169 --> 21:29.138
worked for Jackie for, as
I remember, some years?

21:29.206 --> 21:32.307
Jackie wants Fields gone.

21:32.375 --> 21:36.077
He knows the kid
that pulled the trigger.

21:36.145 --> 21:37.278
- Well done.

21:37.345 --> 21:39.279
You just proved
that someone in Broad Channel

21:39.347 --> 21:40.847
Has a connection
with Jackie Dooley.

21:40.914 --> 21:42.414
It means nothing.

21:42.482 --> 21:43.682
I want the shooter.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.517
Any thoughts?

21:45.584 --> 21:46.985
- She'll tell Jackie
where his son is.

21:47.052 --> 21:48.085
- You think?

21:48.153 --> 21:49.186
- She's in love with the guy.

21:49.254 --> 21:50.620
- Oh, that maybe
should be past tense.

21:50.688 --> 21:52.223
- No, look at her
talking to him.

21:52.290 --> 21:53.258
It's all over her face.

21:53.326 --> 21:55.260
She'll tell him
anything he asks.

21:55.327 --> 21:57.094
That could maybe
work for us.

21:59.797 --> 22:02.631
- I like it.

22:02.699 --> 22:04.500
- I don't know.

22:04.567 --> 22:05.801
- Why not?

22:05.869 --> 22:07.202
- Well, one:
he's not gonna do it.

22:07.270 --> 22:08.504
And number two:
even if he does

22:08.571 --> 22:10.239
and she actually tells him,

22:10.306 --> 22:12.441
he'll lie to us
and say that she didn't.

22:12.509 --> 22:14.743
- Not if he has no connection,
which he doesn't.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.046
- Also, it serves
his purpose.

22:17.113 --> 22:18.547
- Takes the heat off him.

22:18.615 --> 22:20.382
- To get the real truth,
we make him wear a wire.

22:20.450 --> 22:21.983
- Jackie Dooley
wearing a wire for us?

22:22.051 --> 22:23.486
I don't see that happening.

22:23.553 --> 22:26.558
- If he really wants
this to go away, why not?

22:26.626 --> 22:29.428
- Might be helpful

22:29.496 --> 22:31.997
to get the full picture.

22:33.833 --> 22:37.335
- Worth a shot.

22:37.403 --> 22:38.803
Moira Boyle.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.804
- She's a fine woman.
What about her?

22:40.872 --> 22:42.772
- How well do you know her?

22:42.840 --> 22:47.142
- [laughs]
None of your damn business.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.610
- We need your help

22:48.678 --> 22:50.478
To find her son Eddie.

22:50.546 --> 22:51.947
- My help?

22:52.014 --> 22:54.649
Hmm.
How ironic.

22:54.717 --> 22:58.285
- Moira'll tell you
where her boy is if you ask.

22:58.353 --> 23:00.587
- Well, I'm not
in an asking mood.

23:00.654 --> 23:04.624
Plain fact is,
I don't inform on my own.

23:04.692 --> 23:08.327
You can call it
a sense of honor.

23:08.395 --> 23:11.465
A thing most rare
in these environs.

23:11.533 --> 23:14.434
And I'm not
going to defile it

23:14.502 --> 23:16.369
for a man
who defiled his uniform.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.137
May I go?
- Sit down!

23:18.205 --> 23:21.374
- Unless you're gonna
arrest me, I can walk.

23:23.576 --> 23:26.578
You just can't get past it,
can you?

23:26.646 --> 23:28.814
- Not some things.

23:34.487 --> 23:36.054
- Can I just...?

23:36.122 --> 23:38.823
Mr. Dooley...

23:38.891 --> 23:41.759
Maybe you're right, hmm?

23:41.827 --> 23:43.527
Maybe Fields was dirty.

23:43.595 --> 23:45.229
You know, maybe in some way
of looking at it,

23:45.296 --> 23:47.097
he got what he deserved.
- Hmm.

23:47.165 --> 23:49.333
- I don't know.
I'm not a judge.

23:49.401 --> 23:51.602
But what I do know

23:51.670 --> 23:54.438
is that the kid who killed him
has got to come in.

23:56.007 --> 23:58.542
Smoke?

24:00.345 --> 24:02.345
[lighter clicks]

24:06.184 --> 24:08.518
This thing
in Broad Channel...

24:08.586 --> 24:10.920
- Yeah, what?

24:10.988 --> 24:13.921
You think
I would hire a junkie

24:13.989 --> 24:16.156
to assassinate
a police officer

24:16.224 --> 24:18.057
in my own backyard?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.958
- It's a ridiculous idea.
- Yeah.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.492
- But we can't let this stand.

24:21.559 --> 24:22.992
You know that.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.327
Now, let me
ask you a question.

24:25.395 --> 24:27.995
Moira's son...
He's a Broad Channel boy.

24:28.063 --> 24:30.029
It serves no one

24:30.097 --> 24:32.998
if he gets found
and killed out there.

24:35.067 --> 24:36.533
- I know.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.101
It would be a bad thing.

24:38.169 --> 24:42.037
- So get Moira to talk.

24:42.104 --> 24:43.570
That's our best shot
at keeping this

24:43.638 --> 24:45.138
from getting any uglier,

24:45.206 --> 24:48.139
because sooner or later,
he's gonna get cornered,

24:48.207 --> 24:50.607
and then he's gonna start
banging away,

24:50.675 --> 24:54.643
and it's gonna be pop, pop, pop
all over the neighborhood.

24:54.711 --> 24:56.278
- I know.

24:56.345 --> 24:59.679
- So give us a hand, huh?

24:59.747 --> 25:02.514
Do it for Broad Channel.

25:02.581 --> 25:06.482
Please, Mr. Dooley,
we, we have nowhere else to go.

25:10.018 --> 25:11.918
- Would I have
to wear a wire?

25:20.424 --> 25:22.257
- I've been doing this
a while,

25:22.325 --> 25:24.725
and, uh,
in all those years,

25:24.793 --> 25:26.627
I have never seen
such a complete pile

25:26.694 --> 25:29.195
Of unadulterated--
- It was effective.

25:29.263 --> 25:31.130
- The game
they played in there?

25:31.198 --> 25:33.031
It has stink
written all over it.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.265
What are you,
dazzled by the guy?

25:34.333 --> 25:35.733
- Nichols, back to earth.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.134
- Hmm?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.336
- I'm not dazzled.
I'm playing him.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.338
And don't deny
that you're playing him too.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.139
All that
righteous indignation...

25:43.207 --> 25:46.475
You're doing it
just to fire Atwater up.

25:46.543 --> 25:48.077
- You're good.

25:48.144 --> 25:50.745
- Or maybe you were just
too obvious.

25:50.813 --> 25:54.281
Anyway, let's hope it works
and we get something.

26:05.857 --> 26:08.958
[van door slides closed]

26:12.127 --> 26:15.528
- No Atwater?
Why isn't he hovering around?

26:15.596 --> 26:17.530
- He said he'd brief
the E.S.U. Guys

26:17.597 --> 26:20.065
And cover the area
from a police launch,

26:20.133 --> 26:21.967
in case Eddie Breaks
for open water.

26:22.034 --> 26:24.235
- Good.
So we go without him.

26:24.303 --> 26:25.736
Oop. Jackie.

26:25.804 --> 26:27.671
- Jackie, I'm so glad
you called me.

26:27.738 --> 26:30.005
- Well, my dear,
I know you're in need,

26:30.073 --> 26:32.505
and that
distresses me greatly.

26:32.572 --> 26:35.507
And we have a very serious thing
to talk about.

26:35.574 --> 26:37.675
- Well, I knew
you could help me out.

26:37.743 --> 26:39.010
- Well, I'm gonna try.

26:39.078 --> 26:41.311
- Oh, well,
I, I'm so relieved

26:41.379 --> 26:43.280
That I can count on you.

26:43.347 --> 26:45.314
- Is there something wrong
with the mic?

26:45.382 --> 26:46.849
- She's running her hand
over it.

26:46.917 --> 26:49.651
- I want to protect your boy.
- Ew.

26:49.719 --> 26:51.186
- And I think
I know how to fix it.

26:51.253 --> 26:53.587
Now, here's
what we got to do.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.689
We got to be wise here.

26:55.756 --> 26:58.024
Mix a little wisdom,
a little mercy.

26:58.091 --> 26:59.691
Help me help him.

26:59.759 --> 27:01.359
Are you with me?

27:01.427 --> 27:02.694
- Yeah.

27:02.761 --> 27:04.361
- Now, the thing is...

27:04.429 --> 27:06.429
And this is hard to accept...

27:06.497 --> 27:10.099
I can't help him
until he's been taken in.

27:11.867 --> 27:12.867
- Wait, taken in?

27:12.935 --> 27:14.535
- Yeah.
Now, I know, sweetheart.

27:14.603 --> 27:16.136
It's a terrible pill
to swallow,

27:16.204 --> 27:18.037
but it's for his own good.

27:18.105 --> 27:21.039
And once he's been taken in,
I can begin to shift my levers,

27:21.107 --> 27:23.575
use my connections,
try to make a deal for him.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.543
- But to turn himself in,
Jackie...

27:25.611 --> 27:27.344
- No, no, no.
It's for his own good.

27:27.412 --> 27:30.146
But right now
he's out there

27:30.214 --> 27:32.814
with a thousand
trigger-happy police chaps

27:32.882 --> 27:34.816
looking under every rock
and stone for him.

27:34.883 --> 27:35.983
- Oh, Jesus.

27:36.051 --> 27:38.251
- Think about it.

27:38.319 --> 27:41.153
Tell me, darling.

27:41.221 --> 27:45.589
Tell your Jackie
where the boy is.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.162
[loud rustling]

27:54.230 --> 27:56.497
- I thought
he would be safest...

27:56.565 --> 27:57.631
Away from the house,

27:57.699 --> 27:58.999
And...

27:59.066 --> 28:02.001
[sighs] God, Jackie,
he looks so awful.

28:02.068 --> 28:03.001
- I know.

28:03.069 --> 28:04.268
- I put him over there,

28:04.336 --> 28:06.003
and I told him not to open
that door for nobody.

28:06.071 --> 28:07.838
He's just down the way
at Smitty's.

28:07.906 --> 28:08.906
- Smitty's.

28:08.973 --> 28:10.474
Anybody know
a place called Smitty's?

28:10.541 --> 28:12.810
Moira's saying that Eddie
is hidden at Smitty's.

28:12.878 --> 28:14.812
Do you know where that is?
- Smitty's boat rental.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.181
It's closed for the season.

28:16.248 --> 28:18.016
It's out in the deep channel
on 12th Road.

28:18.084 --> 28:19.685
Have E.S.U. mount up.

28:20.921 --> 28:23.991
[engine revving]

28:24.059 --> 28:25.125
- Surround the entire area,

28:25.193 --> 28:27.027
But nobody moves in
until we get there.

28:27.095 --> 28:28.929
And no flashing lights
or sirens.

28:53.257 --> 28:55.258
[gun cocks]

28:59.063 --> 29:01.966
- Eddie?

29:04.404 --> 29:07.073
- He's so precious to me.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.674
- I know.

29:08.742 --> 29:11.277
- I hope one day
he'll be precious to you too.

29:11.345 --> 29:13.079
- I know.

29:13.147 --> 29:15.015
- You know, I never wanted
to be a burden to you.

29:15.082 --> 29:18.185
[gunshots]

29:18.253 --> 29:20.521
- We just heard shots fired.
What the hell is going on?

29:20.589 --> 29:22.657
- What the hell was that?

29:38.272 --> 29:40.206
- It's his gun.

29:40.273 --> 29:41.840
I had no choice.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.778
- Everybody back.

29:46.846 --> 29:48.346
This is a crime scene.

29:48.414 --> 29:49.680
- Watch your language,
Detective.

29:49.748 --> 29:51.148
I did what I had to do.

29:51.216 --> 29:53.950
- Cordon off this area.

29:54.018 --> 29:56.019
And nobody touches that gun.

29:59.790 --> 30:02.791
[indistinct chatter,
Moira sobbing]

30:11.133 --> 30:12.399
- Oh, god!

30:12.467 --> 30:15.469
[continues sobbing]

30:21.041 --> 30:23.141
- No question he's dirty.

30:23.209 --> 30:24.842
This was all about him.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.777
- I know.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.097
- Ah, there we go.

30:38.165 --> 30:40.199
So look at this.

30:40.266 --> 30:43.167
Jackie, the boss.

30:43.235 --> 30:45.203
- Moira Boyle,
former secretary.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.337
- All right.

30:46.404 --> 30:48.172
Uh, years ago,

30:48.239 --> 30:51.540
when, as a lovely young lady,

30:51.608 --> 30:54.844
She was claimed by
the, uh, Lord of Broad Channel.

30:54.912 --> 30:57.679
- Until Jackie moved
someone younger into her place.

30:57.747 --> 30:58.980
- Thank you so much.

30:59.048 --> 31:01.549
Uh, every three or four years,
he takes on a new model.

31:01.617 --> 31:03.784
- Moira is on her own

31:03.852 --> 31:07.854
with a loser son
with a drug record,

31:07.922 --> 31:10.689
who she's pushing jackie
to hire.

31:10.756 --> 31:12.624
That is the first thread.

31:12.692 --> 31:14.092
Now, watch this.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.894
Second thread:

31:16.962 --> 31:21.265
Jackie has a deal
with Fields.

31:21.332 --> 31:23.533
Jackie pays Fields...

31:23.601 --> 31:25.434
- To keep Queens cops
off his back,

31:25.502 --> 31:27.336
but Fields starts
to have financial problems,

31:27.404 --> 31:28.536
starts jacking people.

31:28.604 --> 31:29.904
- But there's another cop.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.139
A dirty, ambitious cop.

31:32.207 --> 31:33.475
Are you with me?

31:33.543 --> 31:35.010
- Now's your chance
to say Atwater--

31:35.077 --> 31:37.778
Grew up in Broad Channel.
- That's right.

31:37.846 --> 31:39.313
- So Atwater tells Jackie

31:39.380 --> 31:42.416
he wants to step
into Fields' shoes...

31:42.483 --> 31:44.984
- And then
Jackie says to him,

31:45.052 --> 31:46.819
"Well, there might be
some way

31:46.887 --> 31:49.821
I can help you out
with that."

31:49.889 --> 31:53.824
Jackie does it
without doing it.

31:53.892 --> 31:55.559
- Which is why
you never caught him

31:55.627 --> 31:57.594
and why he'll skate
this time.

31:57.662 --> 32:00.230
Atwater
didn't pick up Eddie.

32:00.298 --> 32:02.832
Fields did
and ended up dead.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.302
There's no link to Jackie.

32:06.369 --> 32:08.170
- Well...

32:08.238 --> 32:12.241
This time
I think there is.

32:15.578 --> 32:19.280
- So you, you kill my boy,

32:19.348 --> 32:22.282
And now you're threatening me
with arrest?

32:22.349 --> 32:25.551
- You hid your son
knowing he was a fugitive.

32:25.618 --> 32:28.620
- Accomplice after the fact
to murder.

32:28.688 --> 32:31.122
- What's this
really about, huh?

32:31.190 --> 32:32.957
The charge is a hummer,
and you know it.

32:33.024 --> 32:35.626
- It's not something
we want to do anything about,

32:35.694 --> 32:39.729
But the D.A.'s office
has agreed to press it,

32:39.797 --> 32:42.631
Unless...

32:45.201 --> 32:47.501
- I expect
you want Jackie.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.669
- He hasn't done you
any recent favors.

32:49.737 --> 32:52.804
He wore a wire for us
so we could find Eddie.

33:04.781 --> 33:06.048
- That's a lie.

33:06.115 --> 33:08.750
- We have a transcript.

33:15.322 --> 33:18.158
- Lies...

33:19.828 --> 33:21.596
Lies.

33:21.663 --> 33:23.931
There's nothing
you filthy cops wouldn't do.

33:23.999 --> 33:26.833
Jackie's word to yours?
There's no contest.

33:26.901 --> 33:30.470
Go on.
Put me on trial.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.850
- Sure you don't want some?
It helps.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.284
- Helps what?

33:40.352 --> 33:43.287
- A little food
alleviates depression.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.588
- Ah.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.456
Hey, look at, uh...

33:46.524 --> 33:50.725
Eddie Boyle's arrest report.

33:50.793 --> 33:53.128
Does that look
unusual to you?

33:53.196 --> 33:54.996
- Oh, my god.

33:55.064 --> 33:56.131
- You see that?

33:56.199 --> 33:58.666
- The ink's a bit smeared.

33:58.734 --> 34:01.669
- It was written
with a fountain pen.

34:01.737 --> 34:04.638
So what, uh,
smarmy jackanapes

34:04.706 --> 34:06.506
Do we know who writes
with a fountain pen?

34:06.574 --> 34:09.875
- So the arrest was made
by Atwater, not Fields.

34:09.943 --> 34:12.945
- That's right.

34:13.013 --> 34:14.545
[keys clacking,
computer beeps]

34:14.614 --> 34:16.947
- No charges were ever filed.

34:17.016 --> 34:18.983
There's not a shred of evidence
we can take to court.

34:19.051 --> 34:22.253
- Right, so all we've got
is a volatile mother,

34:22.321 --> 34:26.257
who, at this point,
doesn't want to help us.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.759
- Hmm.

34:27.826 --> 34:29.994
We, uh,
might have something.

34:30.061 --> 34:32.094
It's just a thought,
not evidence.

34:32.163 --> 34:33.429
- Shoot.

34:33.498 --> 34:35.831
- Bear with me,
'cause this is out there.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.768
When Moira was talking
to Jackie on the wire,

34:38.835 --> 34:40.603
She said something to him

34:40.670 --> 34:42.603
after she gave up
the location of her son.

34:42.672 --> 34:44.505
- What?
That thing about her,

34:44.574 --> 34:46.708
her son
being precious to her?

34:46.775 --> 34:47.708
- After that.

34:47.775 --> 34:49.409
She, uh,
told Jackie she hoped

34:49.478 --> 34:51.478
that one day
he'd be precious to him, too,

34:51.547 --> 34:55.683
and that she never wanted
to be a burden.

34:57.286 --> 34:58.886
What did she mean?

34:58.954 --> 35:01.555
What'd she hold back?

35:01.623 --> 35:03.724
What could take
more courage to say

35:03.791 --> 35:05.858
than giving up
the location of her son?

35:10.364 --> 35:12.064
- That's brilliant.

35:12.132 --> 35:16.334
- Jackie has a kid
he didn't know about.

35:16.402 --> 35:18.336
I say we bring him in
and hit him with it.

35:18.404 --> 35:20.572
- To make him testify
against Atwater?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.574
- Atwater shot his kid.

35:22.641 --> 35:24.909
- Won't work.
- Why not?

35:24.977 --> 35:27.545
- He won't care.
The man's a reptile.

35:27.613 --> 35:30.682
- Well, it's not just
about him.

35:40.759 --> 35:42.927
- You know, it might be
a trifling thing to note,

35:42.995 --> 35:46.330
but this is getting
a bit repetitive.

35:46.398 --> 35:48.532
- Atwater...

35:48.600 --> 35:50.935
He had Fields killed

35:51.002 --> 35:53.070
and hired Eddie to do it.

35:53.138 --> 35:55.105
- That's your theory?
- Is that true?

35:55.173 --> 35:56.473
- How should I know?

35:56.540 --> 35:58.775
- Fields was squeezing
your shoes.

35:58.843 --> 36:01.510
Atwater wanted Fields' spot.

36:01.578 --> 36:05.447
Moira Boyle
was pushing her son at you.

36:05.515 --> 36:07.783
- Look, if we're gonna be
here awhile,

36:07.850 --> 36:10.452
might I have a cappuccino?
- What was the first step?

36:10.520 --> 36:13.989
Did you, uh, bitch to Atwater
about getting squeezed,

36:14.057 --> 36:15.557
Or did he come to you?

36:15.625 --> 36:18.093
- I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

36:18.160 --> 36:22.697
- Atwater tells Eddie
that you want Fields dead.

36:22.765 --> 36:26.768
Here, what did Eddie
say to Fields

36:26.835 --> 36:28.936
Over the pay phone
that night?

36:29.004 --> 36:31.405
- How would I know that?

36:31.472 --> 36:35.075
- I think he said, "Jackie
has agreed to the price hike.

36:35.143 --> 36:37.509
I have it right here.
Meet me in Broad Channel."

36:37.577 --> 36:39.343
- Who knows?

36:39.411 --> 36:42.412
Who cares?

36:42.479 --> 36:45.247
<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i>

36:47.250 --> 36:49.216
- "Of the dead,
speak no evil."

36:49.284 --> 36:50.350
- Mm.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.484
They're both gone.
It's over.

36:52.552 --> 36:53.652
We can all rest.

36:53.719 --> 36:56.087
- It's not over
until the right guy pays.

36:56.154 --> 36:58.488
Just tell me.
Am I on the right track?

37:01.858 --> 37:03.258
- Well...

37:03.325 --> 37:05.092
Let's see.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.093
You make a compelling case.

37:07.161 --> 37:08.427
There's not a link in it

37:08.495 --> 37:11.096
that's the least bit
implausible.

37:11.164 --> 37:15.765
But I will confirm
no part of it.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.499
And Atwater,
if he did the dreadful deed,

37:18.567 --> 37:20.033
he's gonna deny it too.

37:20.101 --> 37:24.069
So that only leaves
poor Eddie Boyle.

37:24.137 --> 37:27.205
And given our fearful lack
of communication

37:27.273 --> 37:29.207
with the dead...

37:29.274 --> 37:31.775
It seems unlikely.

37:34.478 --> 37:36.512
- Tell me
about Eddie Boyle.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.247
- What about him?

37:38.315 --> 37:41.516
- What was he like?

37:41.584 --> 37:43.485
- What you'd expect--

37:43.553 --> 37:47.355
Vicious little thing,
drug-addled, bit of a worm.

37:47.422 --> 37:49.123
- Did you know his father?

37:49.191 --> 37:51.692
- Ah, only rumors.

37:51.759 --> 37:55.128
Moira's been round-heeled
since she was 16.

37:55.196 --> 37:58.631
- Moira insisted
that Eddie suck up to you.

37:58.699 --> 37:59.732
- Yeah.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.868
He used to volunteer
for this and that.

38:02.935 --> 38:06.237
- The mother loses her lover

38:06.305 --> 38:10.908
and tries to reconnect to him
through her child?

38:10.976 --> 38:12.643
- You make it sound perverse.

38:12.711 --> 38:15.245
- You think so?

38:15.313 --> 38:19.248
Well, it gets
more, uh, twisted than that.

38:22.285 --> 38:23.519
You want to hear this?

38:23.586 --> 38:26.521
- Do I have a choice?

38:26.589 --> 38:29.257
- Moira's been keeping
a secret.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.229
He was yours...

38:35.296 --> 38:38.464
Your boy, Jackie.

38:42.702 --> 38:44.569
- I don't give a damn
if he was.

38:44.637 --> 38:46.638
- [breathes shakily]

38:48.607 --> 38:49.573
- You don't?

38:49.641 --> 38:51.374
- No.

38:51.442 --> 38:54.109
I don't give a damn for him,

38:54.177 --> 38:57.111
and I don't give
a damn for her.

38:57.179 --> 39:00.513
Now, what is it that you're
gonna charge me with here?

39:00.581 --> 39:02.882
- Well, Jackie...
[scoffs]

39:02.950 --> 39:04.917
I gave it my best shot.

39:04.985 --> 39:07.686
- Well, the fact
that you failed

39:07.753 --> 39:09.721
doesn't diminish
my opinion of you

39:09.788 --> 39:11.389
in the slightest.
[chuckles]

39:11.457 --> 39:13.224
- That's big of you.

39:13.292 --> 39:15.225
You did it again.

39:15.293 --> 39:17.293
- I admit to nothing.

39:17.361 --> 39:19.061
Did what?

39:19.129 --> 39:21.263
- You did it...

39:21.330 --> 39:22.897
Without doing it.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.468
Come on,
I'll walk you out.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.509
- You...

39:45.480 --> 39:47.346
You...

39:47.414 --> 39:49.915
[crying]
- This way.

39:49.983 --> 39:51.116
- Now, listen.

39:51.184 --> 39:52.751
I don't know what she knows,

39:52.818 --> 39:54.152
But I imagine it's a lot.

39:54.220 --> 39:57.021
Jackie, you're gonna give me
a deposition right now

39:57.089 --> 39:58.255
incriminating Atwater,

39:58.322 --> 39:59.589
or, I swear to you,

39:59.656 --> 40:01.357
I'm gonna keep you
in a jail cell or a courtroom

40:01.424 --> 40:03.492
for the rest of your life,
because you know what?

40:03.559 --> 40:06.294
I don't think
she loves you anymore.

40:10.164 --> 40:12.498
- Well played, sir.

40:12.566 --> 40:15.967
Old Captain Ross
would be proud of you today.

40:18.403 --> 40:21.037
<i>We're a long, long way
from nowhere</i>

40:21.105 --> 40:23.706
<i>With a long,
long way to go</i>

40:23.774 --> 40:25.475
<i>Where these black tides... </i>

40:25.542 --> 40:28.411
- I proceeded to this location
as quickly as possible,

40:28.479 --> 40:30.346
Drew my weapon.

40:30.414 --> 40:33.048
<i>I notified...
- Delivered into darkness</i>

40:33.116 --> 40:36.052
- There's something that I've
been wanting to say to you

40:36.120 --> 40:37.421
since I met you.

40:37.488 --> 40:40.157
Wha, what are you doing?

40:40.225 --> 40:43.494
- You have the right
to remain silent...

40:43.562 --> 40:45.297
Sport.

40:50.304 --> 40:52.940
[handcuffs clicking]

41:14.665 --> 41:17.601
<i>And I'm going back again</i>
