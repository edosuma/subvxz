WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:10.009
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked.

00:10.076 --> 00:12.946
(cheering)
We are doing what we do best.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.814
Fuck me!
Partying,... Whoo!

00:16.282 --> 00:17.717
Tashing on,...

00:17.784 --> 00:19.452
Getting mortal,...

00:19.519 --> 00:20.653
Shagging,...

00:21.788 --> 00:24.758
It's insane. I hate everyone.
No, no, no.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.659
Aaarrgghh!
Grr! Ahhh!

00:26.726 --> 00:28.094
Whoo-hoo!
Argh!

00:29.696 --> 00:31.398
Shit's about to get real.

00:32.265 --> 00:35.168
That's it, we're gonna get tortoises.
Sheldon and Michelle.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.936
Oh, that is a joke!

00:37.003 --> 00:39.639
I'm necking on with Vicky.

00:39.706 --> 00:44.344
I've tashed on with me arch nemesis,
fuck this, I'm gaaning hyem.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.812
Fuck!

00:45.879 --> 00:48.014
If he slept with Marnie,
he needs to admit it.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.919
If you're not gonna bang your friend,
I will. I'd never do that to you.

00:54.487 --> 00:57.957
He's been banging on about lad code,
what a fucking dick.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.226
There's no way I'm staying,
I'm off home.

01:00.293 --> 01:04.364
Finally me and Kyle are having sex.
Bye-bye, Sassy. Hello, Slutty.

01:05.965 --> 01:09.836
If he thinks he fucked things up,
he's got another thing coming.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.573
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.009
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.445
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.647
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.549
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.517
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.619
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:26.686 --> 01:28.521
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double-Fs.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.957
I'll make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.426
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.405
It's finally here, we're doing
the assault course today

01:45.472 --> 01:47.841
and everyone is fucked
from last night.

01:47.907 --> 01:51.010
I need to get them pumped.
This is gonna be massive.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.490
We're about to go
on this shitty assault course.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.726
The only thing I wanna be
assaulting right now

02:06.793 --> 02:08.928
is a Big Mac meal with extra fries.

02:11.197 --> 02:14.734
I'm still mortal, and now I know
Gary's lad code's bullshit

02:14.801 --> 02:17.070
I'm glad I got in Marnie's bed.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.811
Kyle,
you've got half an hour to get up,

02:24.878 --> 02:28.681
pack a bag and jump on a coach,
it's gonna be here. OK.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.183
Sound?
Yeah, sound.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.186
I know it kicked off,
but we've been training for weeks,

02:33.253 --> 02:36.689
and I don't wanna let some stupid
argument spoil all our hard work.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.830
You're not coming?
Mate, I cannit.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.565
Ooh.

02:48.468 --> 02:51.905
I cannit believe because of last
night I've proper fucked my hand,

02:51.971 --> 02:55.074
so I can't go win the hardcore
fitness challenge, what a liberty.

02:57.076 --> 03:00.280
Gaz didn't come back
after it all kicked off.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
Probably a good thing.
Aye. (laughs)

03:08.555 --> 03:10.890
From day one,
the hardcore fitness challenge

03:10.957 --> 03:13.860
was a team effort,
and they've fucked it for everyone.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.763
That's not gonna stop we,
we're gonna smash it.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.136
We're not far away now.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.339
We're three people down,
but still need to be a team.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.074
We need a good team name.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.147
Oh, God, that's awkward (laughs).
"Team Awkward".

03:34.213 --> 03:36.082
(both) Team Awkward.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.852
Holly comes up with Team Awkward,
that suits us down to a T.

03:39.919 --> 03:43.323
Team Awkward are gonna fucking smash
this. Team Awkward, Team Awkward.

03:43.389 --> 03:47.193
Team Awkward, Team Awkward!
Let's punch other people.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.198
This is it, the assault course.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.168
We'll be running through muddy
fields, crawling through tunnels,

03:55.234 --> 03:58.771
climbing up nets and jumping off
obstacles. It's gonna be mint.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.573
Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel!
Let's go!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.141
(cheering)

04:02.208 --> 04:05.945
Team Awkward, ready for action,
three, two, one.

04:08.214 --> 04:11.484
Start moving, let's go!
We've started the race,

04:11.551 --> 04:15.655
we've gotta do is carry a massive
wooden dildo, fuck's sake.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.023
Push now, come on!

04:17.089 --> 04:19.325
We're really, really trying,

04:19.392 --> 04:24.397
but we can't be arsed and the lads
are so much better at this than us.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.666
I really need a drink!
I'm going dizzy.

04:26.733 --> 04:30.203
I've got it. You can do it!
Grab me. Come on, Marnie!

04:36.476 --> 04:39.646
Has anyone got a sausage roll
I can dangle in front of the girls?

04:39.712 --> 04:40.847
Might speed them up.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.049
Howay, you can do it, halfway there.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.550
No.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.588
Yeah, come on!
Get in, Charlotte!

04:51.324 --> 04:52.825
(screams)

04:52.892 --> 04:55.028
(grunts) I'm down!

04:55.094 --> 04:56.562
(screams)

04:58.665 --> 05:01.167
Come on, Holly.
I can do it.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.570
This is mint, we're all helping
each other out, Team Awkward

05:04.637 --> 05:06.773
have united
and we're fucking amazing.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.574
Well done, girls. Next one.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.445
Awkward.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.014
There's five lads
with paintball guns,

05:15.081 --> 05:18.584
I'm in shorts and a vest,
this is gonna fucking hurt. Go!

05:27.293 --> 05:28.728
Fuck me, that hurt!

05:28.795 --> 05:31.364
Me balls
are bouncing round me belly.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.100
Bang! It's like I've been pelted

05:34.167 --> 05:37.704
with 1,000 hard throbbing dicks.
(laughter)

05:37.770 --> 05:40.339
(laughs) Fucking tried.
Ow!

05:40.406 --> 05:43.176
They're not gonna shoot you.
It hurts so bad.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.848
Finish line's in sight, the hard
work's paid off, we've done it,

05:48.915 --> 05:50.717
Team Awkward, get in.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.019
Team Awkward,
we fucking did it, man!

05:53.086 --> 05:54.987
(girls cheer)

05:56.956 --> 05:58.858
We might be sweaty and bruised,

05:58.925 --> 06:02.895
we might be bloody, but we've done
it and we've done it as a team.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.698
(cheering)

06:05.765 --> 06:07.300
But yous done it like.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.069
We are on a massive high,
we're so buzzing,

06:10.136 --> 06:14.273
and then we realise we've gotta
go back to a broken house.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.480
(snores)

06:20.546 --> 06:21.681
Hello?

06:21.748 --> 06:23.783
I'm feeling sheepish
about coming back,

06:23.850 --> 06:28.654
I know I behaved like such a wanker,
I just hope everyone can forgive us.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.889
Hello.

06:31.591 --> 06:36.362
Vicky's walked back in, but I didn't
realise the fucker left.

06:56.015 --> 07:00.453
Fucking hell, it turns out I
picked the right night to go home.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.799
Yoo-hoo!

07:12.865 --> 07:15.701
Fucking hell, you all right?
Well, hello.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.837
Howay then, how was it?
Mint.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.607
We get back and Vicky's there,
but there's still no sign of Gary.

07:21.674 --> 07:25.344
While I've got yous here, really
sorry about my behaviour last night.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.779
I don't remember it anyway.

07:26.846 --> 07:30.850
I don't deserve your forgiveness
but I would really like it.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.219
Vicky's apologised,
but all I wanna know is,

07:33.286 --> 07:36.289
what the fuck was she thinking
necking on with Gary?

07:36.355 --> 07:41.294
Don't feel awkward. When Gary comes
back it'll be weird. God. (laughs)

07:41.360 --> 07:45.865
I don't know why I kissed Gary,
I'm just a bit of a wine taster.

07:45.932 --> 07:51.103
Swill him round and spit him out,
like a substandard Sauvignon Blanc.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.972
(laughing)

07:53.039 --> 07:55.308
What the fuck is wrong with me?

08:02.682 --> 08:06.385
Cannit wait to go out. Gaz isn't
here so there'll be no arguments.

08:06.452 --> 08:10.156
Tonight, I just want everyone
to go pure radge. Howay!

08:11.290 --> 08:12.959
Big night tonight in Riverside,

08:13.025 --> 08:15.628
Gary's home licking his wounds,
let's get smashed.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.432
Let's get fucking mortal, come on!

08:28.007 --> 08:31.444
Aaron's so sweet with us
when Gary's not there.

08:31.510 --> 08:35.147
He talks to us and flirts.
I just hope that it doesn't change

08:35.214 --> 08:36.482
when Gary comes back.

08:44.891 --> 08:48.361
Now Aaron knows Gaz is full of
shit and can't stick to lad code,

08:48.427 --> 08:50.663
he might as well crack on
with Marnie.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.332
Marnie really likes us
and I really like her.

08:53.399 --> 08:57.503
Now there's no bullshit lad code,
there's nowt stopping us. (laughs)

09:05.211 --> 09:08.681
I know Holly slept with Kyle
and says everything's fine.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.584
I don't wanna see her
get her heart broken again.

09:17.523 --> 09:21.627
I'm glad me and Kyle are friends
and it's not getting complicated.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.472
Maybe I've actually cracked this
whole friends-with-benefits thing.

09:39.278 --> 09:44.183
We've all had a mint night, there's
been no arguing, no falling out

09:44.250 --> 09:46.519
and no Gaz, that says it all really.

09:46.585 --> 09:52.124
# "Changing"
- Sigma feat Paloma Faith

10:01.434 --> 10:03.235
The squatty man.

10:05.037 --> 10:08.975
We had a mint night but everyone's
knackered from the assault course,

10:09.041 --> 10:12.078
except Scott and Kyle,
they're double-teaming Holly.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.384
I'm one tequila away from a threesome
and that can't be good, can it?

10:18.451 --> 10:22.521
Stop it, stop it. (laughs)
(laughs) What the fuck's this?

10:22.588 --> 10:25.725
No, Holly, go to bed alone.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.935
This could go either way. If I don't
get an apology me and him are done.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.505
Seeing Gary reminds us of what
I done and how horrible it is.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.107
Aaron, I'm going.

10:41.173 --> 10:44.010
I didn't wanna like him and I do.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.612
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

10:46.679 --> 10:48.948
.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.552
.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.364
(snores)

11:05.431 --> 11:08.300
We wake up
and it's Scott T's birthday.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.437
Me and Kyle are gonna give him
the best present.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.507
I put happy birthday
and you put Scott T on me.

11:18.611 --> 11:22.214
Oi-oi, Scotty fucking T.
Scotty T-Dog.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.817
Happy birthday, kid.
Happy birthday, mate.

11:24.884 --> 11:28.654
Best birthday wake-up ever, Kyle and
Aaron rock in with a protein shake

11:28.721 --> 11:31.857
and nuts, these lads know
what I like to scran, yummy.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.426
Scott, you ready?

11:35.394 --> 11:37.596
(laughs) That looks fun.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.002
Aaron, where's the O?

11:45.237 --> 11:47.039
Buzzing,
just what I've always wanted,

11:47.106 --> 11:50.209
an eye-full of Aaron's fucking
arsehole for me breakfast.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.812
There's no guarantee
Gaz will come back tonight.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.981
It's Scott's birthday
and Gaz still hasn't shown his face.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.883
He needs to face the music.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.557
I want Gaz to come cos he's me mate,

12:04.623 --> 12:08.194
but the kid needs to sort his
fucking act and his priorities out.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.534
(phone rings)

12:15.601 --> 12:16.802
Phone.

12:18.604 --> 12:21.740
Hello?
Happy birthday, Scott.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.409
Thanks very much, Anna.

12:27.513 --> 12:28.514
Right.

12:31.951 --> 12:36.555
I've gotta go and clean a bar with
Gaz as a punishment, what a liberty.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.064
(laughs) That's mint.
What's happening?

12:45.131 --> 12:48.334
Anna said we're allowed to have
a house party tonight

12:48.400 --> 12:52.638
and it's a 'Ha-Whey-Aye' Hawaii
(laughs) theme.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.940
Ha-Whey-Aye?
Ha-Whey-Aye.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.310
Ha-Whey-Aye?
Bit fucking tenuous, innit?

13:03.349 --> 13:07.419
I haven't spoke to Gaz, if I don't
get an apology we're fucking done.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.122
I'm seeing Scott for the first time

13:10.189 --> 13:12.825
since we were punching windows
and screaming.

13:14.193 --> 13:17.263
All right, kid?
All right, kid? Fucking hell.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.564
This could go either way.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.867
Ah, you fucker.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.003
So, what's the crack?

13:27.306 --> 13:30.376
You've got to think,
I had so much going on with her.

13:30.442 --> 13:34.847
You've got out the house, the first
thing is to go and bang Marnie.

13:34.914 --> 13:38.884
Cos we're meant to be fucking best
pals, I'd never do that to you.

13:38.951 --> 13:42.688
Gaz doesn't realise the difference
between having feelings and banging.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.724
I had feelings for Marnie,
Aaron does

13:45.791 --> 13:48.794
and Gaz just wanted to bang her,
it's simple.

13:53.132 --> 13:57.503
That's all I want to hear from you
cos that's why we fucking fell out.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.573
It's all these fucking rules, man,
what the fuck?

14:00.639 --> 14:03.342
There's no point
if no-one's gonna abide by them.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.945
Gaz apologises to us,
but if he was honest

14:06.011 --> 14:09.582
instead of being a sly prick,
no-one would be in this situation.

14:09.648 --> 14:14.153
The main thing was me and you making
up and you've said sorry, it's done.

14:16.655 --> 14:20.059
If she wanted to pull Aaron,
she shouldn't have banged us.

14:20.125 --> 14:24.163
Why on the second night or the third?
Two or three times she banged us.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.399
He's adamant it's Marnie's fault cos
she's came between everyone.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.502
She's using stupid, horrible
fucking tactics to do it,

14:30.569 --> 14:32.838
cos she's that desperate
to get with him.

14:32.905 --> 14:36.976
Marnie's a head fuck, she plays games
and knows exactly what she's doing.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.919
(all) Hi.
Hello!

14:46.986 --> 14:52.224
Gary's not with Scott, maybe Gary
won't be coming tonight after all?

14:54.126 --> 14:57.730
Basically I just tell him the crack,
I just went in and he apologised.

14:57.796 --> 15:01.567
What did he say about the lad code?
He was like, "Well, fair enough."

15:01.634 --> 15:05.771
"I'm not bothered if Aaron gets with
Marnie, but why is she doing...?

15:06.905 --> 15:08.941
Now I'm in trouble for doing it?

15:09.008 --> 15:11.410
He's trying to take
the fucking blame off himself.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.747
Once again Gary's trying
to wheedle his way out of something

15:14.813 --> 15:17.149
by turning the blame
onto someone else.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.485
He's a shit mate with no morals.

15:24.623 --> 15:28.827
We're having a Hawaii theme party
and we wanna look pure Hawaiian.

15:28.894 --> 15:32.331
We're gonna get bronzed up and
I'll stuff a pineapple on me cock.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.133
I'm a pineapple!

15:34.199 --> 15:38.570
We're looking like tropical Spartan
warriors, tonight's gonna go off.

15:41.473 --> 15:45.044
Has anyone got a baby wipe?
You cannot poo in the bin!

15:45.744 --> 15:47.746
Two, one, go!

15:53.118 --> 15:57.056
Fucking mint! Come on!
We just done a bowl of punch in one.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.129
Oh, there he is!
Oh, he's back!

16:04.196 --> 16:07.366
In walks Gaz.
Fuck, this is gonna be awkward.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.838
Gaz has apologised
so I'm gonna be civil,

16:12.905 --> 16:15.674
but he's got a lot of bridges
to build.

16:19.044 --> 16:22.214
Sorted things out with Scott.
I need to patch things up with Aaron.

16:26.085 --> 16:31.357
I don't want you to think that that
was a rule for me... Listen to me.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.894
That's been in me head.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.304
The reason I haven't went there
is because of your lad code,

16:45.371 --> 16:47.239
nothing to do
with being second best.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.077
That's my point.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.680
Gary will never admit
he's in the wrong.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.349
I like Marnie
and she likes me, end of.

16:57.416 --> 17:01.186
Marnie's been flirting a lot with me
and I've been flirting with her.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.189
Here, forget about it.
If I neck on, I neck on.

17:04.256 --> 17:08.292
You neck on, I couldn't give a flying
fuck. Water under the bridge, mate.

17:08.359 --> 17:12.698
I couldn't care if he wants to pull
Marnie, if Marnie wants to pull Aaron

17:12.765 --> 17:16.902
if they wanna shag on the kitchen
table. I wanna have a good night.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.503
Let's get this party started!

17:21.006 --> 17:24.710
Now they've sorted out their tiff,
hopefully we'll have a mint night.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.913
Happy birthday!

17:32.084 --> 17:34.553
Let's go fucking berserk!

17:36.688 --> 17:41.293
It's nice to see all the family back
together, fucking whistle posse.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.803
I can't believe Gary's swanned back
in, best friends with everyone,

17:50.869 --> 17:52.304
it's completely killed me mood.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.240
I'll get through.
Get mortal and ignore him.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.949
There's birds all over the place,

18:04.016 --> 18:06.318
someone call an ambulance,
this party's sick.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.356
Whoa, whoa, wait a second,
what was that look?

18:11.423 --> 18:17.463
You just looked over there at Kyle
in the weirdest way I've ever saw.

18:17.529 --> 18:21.500
It's my job to look after Holly.
If she's left to her own devices

18:21.567 --> 18:24.937
she'll just end up on the end
of Kyle's cock again,

18:25.003 --> 18:29.608
but not on my watch, Holly.
Not on my watch.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.143
So what's your plan.

18:31.210 --> 18:35.647
I don't really have one. I'm getting
mortal and seeing what happens.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.154
Every Hawaiian birthday party
needs a good limbo competition.

18:44.490 --> 18:48.260
I'll whack me cock out now and see
how many birds can shimmy under it.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.062
Leave her alone!

18:50.128 --> 18:52.264
Yay!
She achieved it!

18:54.633 --> 18:56.869
Go on, James!

19:12.284 --> 19:15.387
Seeing Gary reminds us what I done
and how horrible it is.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.690
(yells) And I can't be bothered
to face it tonight.

19:19.691 --> 19:22.728
This is awkward.
Marnie, where you going?

19:22.794 --> 19:26.498
There's nothing you can say to us,
babe. I love you so much.

19:26.565 --> 19:30.335
Where you going? I think the world
of ya but I'm going home.

19:30.402 --> 19:33.238
I want her to stay,
she needs to forget about Gary.

19:33.305 --> 19:37.009
Give us a cuddle, give us a cuddle,
give us a cuddle.

19:38.644 --> 19:42.014
Yeah but the deed's done.
I'm going. Give us a cuddle.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.216
I'm going, I'm going!
Give us a cuddle.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.351
I love you but I'm going.
Give us a cuddle. Please.

19:47.953 --> 19:52.324
I wanna go home and if there's one
person to stop us, it's Aaron.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.159
(laughs)

19:58.964 --> 20:01.333
One minute I'm crying, upset,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.169
the next I'm rolling around
kissing Aaron.

20:04.236 --> 20:08.173
This is not how I seen mine
and Aaron's first kiss happening.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.110
I'm glad I convinced Marnie to stay
and we're finally kissing, sweet.

20:14.146 --> 20:20.852
# "Let This Last Forever"
- Benny Benassi feat Gary Go

20:30.629 --> 20:35.300
So Kyle's necking on and I'm trying
so hard not to be bothered.

20:35.367 --> 20:40.072
I didn't wanna like him and I do,
and I don't know what to do about it.

20:48.914 --> 20:53.685
I feel stupid. Why did I have to get
upset? Why did I have to like him?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.187
This is so annoying.

21:14.373 --> 21:19.211
Me and Aaron have had a little kiss,
but I'm not gonna put out just yet,

21:19.277 --> 21:22.147
I'm gonna make him wait
cos I like him too much.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.717
This house party has been
a complete disaster.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.286
Kyle went off
and pulled some random girl.

21:28.353 --> 21:31.323
I hope she was fucking worth it
cos if you think

21:31.390 --> 21:33.892
you're jumping in bed with me again,
you're wrong.

21:33.959 --> 21:39.131
Don't get us wrong, Holly's sound
as fuck but this bird is unreal,

21:39.197 --> 21:43.568
so I'm gonna feel her coconuts
and let her see me limbo stick.

21:44.603 --> 21:45.937
(vomits)

21:46.004 --> 21:52.144
Here I am being sick into a fucking
bin. Oh, I'm a fucking tramp.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.450
We invite you to the first...
(both) Geordie Shore wedding.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.851
Are they fucking stupid?

21:59.918 --> 22:03.989
It's the last night and I'm gonna
end this experience with a bang.

22:04.823 --> 22:09.528
What are you doing, you stupid
slag?! That's fucking Gary!

22:09.594 --> 22:12.264
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

22:12.330 --> 22:14.466
. .

22:17.069 --> 22:19.071
.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.285
Last night was class.

22:33.351 --> 22:37.723
I ended up cracking on with this
blonde lass all night, fucking mint.

22:40.559 --> 22:41.560
Did he?

22:41.626 --> 22:45.630
Oh, my God. I know that Holly wanted
to shag him, she's gonna be gutted.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.467
What?

22:55.073 --> 22:59.344
Poor Holly, I feel like she always
gets herself into this situation.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.413
You OK, mate?
Yeah.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.582
I'm not gonna lie, I did get jealous.

23:03.648 --> 23:07.652
Fucking told you, you can't let
people stick their body parts in you

23:07.719 --> 23:10.789
and expect to be OK when they
fucking let other people.

23:10.856 --> 23:13.325
I don't know why I did it again.

23:13.391 --> 23:18.330
So that it is, it stops now.
The buck stops here. Here. OK.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.565
There's plenty more cock in the sea.

23:26.638 --> 23:31.409
Why did we ever get these?
You said that they have sex. Yeah.

23:31.476 --> 23:33.645
These tortoises are shit.

23:33.712 --> 23:38.583
They were supposed to be bucking all
the time, but there's been nothing.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.319
I think it's a no-sex
before marriage thing.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.823
I think these tortoises are prudes,
so for them to have sex...

23:44.890 --> 23:49.327
Let's have a wedding for them.
(gasps) I get to get a hat!

23:49.394 --> 23:53.398
You can be a bridesmaid,
I'll be the vicar.

23:53.465 --> 23:56.301
Kyle could be the best man.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.371
We're gonna have a tortoise wedding,
and I'm the bridesmaid

23:59.437 --> 24:03.608
and Kyle's the best man. Everybody
knows what happens between them.

24:03.675 --> 24:06.745
We've got an announcement to make.
What?

24:06.812 --> 24:10.649
We invite you all to the first...
(both) Geordie Shore wedding.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.086
Have yous got something
to tell we like?

24:15.153 --> 24:17.389
Michelle and Sheldon
are tying the knot.

24:17.455 --> 24:21.259
Sometimes I sit and ask meself
what I did in a previous life

24:21.326 --> 24:25.730
to deserve this shit? Why am I
surrounded by complete morons?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.667
We're marrying the fucking turtles?
Yeah. My life.

24:28.733 --> 24:32.671
They want yous all to be invited.
The wedding will be tomorrow.

24:46.251 --> 24:50.589
I admit, I did get upset last night
and I was jealous that Kyle pulled

24:50.655 --> 24:54.993
but tonight's family night so he
can't pull, so I won't get jealous.

24:57.762 --> 25:02.067
It's the last night, we're buzzing.
Let's go out with a fucking bang.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.903
Last night, last night, last night!

25:13.645 --> 25:16.281
Everyone is proper buzzing,
let's fucking have it.

25:17.148 --> 25:21.419
It's the last night, family night,
and no pulling. I'm not bothered,

25:21.486 --> 25:22.988
I'm happy with Marnie.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.702
Right now I couldn't be happier.

25:37.769 --> 25:41.773
Everyone's got a smile on their face,
I'm fucking buzzing.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.441
Why?!

25:48.880 --> 25:50.682
After everything we've been through,

25:50.749 --> 25:54.686
we might actually be friends, one
thing I never thought would happen.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.858
Gary will never change.

25:59.925 --> 26:03.929
He'll always be a nightmare,
but at least he's not my nightmare.

26:13.071 --> 26:17.542
We're having an amazing last night,
all I wanna do is get with Aaron.

26:17.609 --> 26:22.447
Being a real mate to Marnie, she's
special. Who knows where it'll go?

26:31.389 --> 26:35.293
Me and Holly have been flirting,
I can tell which way this is going.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.172
Tonight is the last night. I'm gonna
end this experience with a bang,

26:47.238 --> 26:48.239
literally.

27:01.953 --> 27:05.757
After all the dramas, arguments and
for all the shit we've been through,

27:05.824 --> 27:09.127
it's so good to see everyone
having such an amazing night.

27:20.271 --> 27:24.309
We get back to the house
and there's pizza, kebabs,

27:24.376 --> 27:25.877
I'm in heaven.

27:29.147 --> 27:33.518
What better thing to do than get
in the hot tub and flail around?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.820
Fucking Geordie Shore!

27:35.887 --> 27:37.756
(squealing)

27:39.357 --> 27:42.927
Everyone's jumping in the hot tub,
but the only place I wanna jump

27:42.994 --> 27:44.963
is in bed with Marnie.

27:52.704 --> 27:55.774
I can't believe that those two twats
have just picked us up

27:55.840 --> 27:58.943
and thrown us in this bubbling pit
of bodily fluids.

28:01.513 --> 28:05.016
Vicky sits next to us
and starts getting very flirty.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.918
What am I playing at?

28:06.985 --> 28:08.386
Ugh!

28:08.453 --> 28:09.888
It's sickening.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.324
So Vicky looks like
she's cracking on with Gary, weird,

28:13.391 --> 28:17.662
Aaron's with Marnie, and it's time to
kick off operation Holly bucks Kyle.

28:17.729 --> 28:20.131
I'll make the bed nice and comfy.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.469
This has been the best night ever

28:24.536 --> 28:28.940
and what better way to end it than
riding the cock off Kyle? Let's go.

# "The Bad Touch"
- The Bloodhound Gang

28:34.679 --> 28:37.515
Fuck me, Holly's keen,
but I'm not complaining.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.789
I was bent over, he was flipping me
around, I was upside down

28:44.856 --> 28:48.493
and then I think I was in some kind
of helicopter position. (groans)

28:50.095 --> 28:51.496
(groans)

28:51.563 --> 28:53.731
Oh, my God, that was fucking amazing.

29:01.773 --> 29:04.542
It's me last night
and I'm absolutely buzzing

29:04.609 --> 29:08.213
that I finally got the lad
that I wanted the whole time.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.987
I'm sitting in the garden with Gary.
Why the fuck

29:16.054 --> 29:19.324
am I even in the garden
on me own with Gary anyway?

29:21.693 --> 29:24.696
I thought I was mortal,
not fucking mental.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.666
Everyone's gone to bed and it looks
like I'm going to bed as well...

29:28.733 --> 29:30.068
With Vicky.

29:31.836 --> 29:36.975
I never thought I would ever hear
the words Gaz, Vicky and shag pad,

29:37.041 --> 29:38.476
in the same sentence.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.580
What are you doing you stupid slag?!

29:42.647 --> 29:44.716
That's fucking Gary!

29:45.350 --> 29:48.253
I've woke up this morning
in bed with Gary.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.288
This is an all-time personal low.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.023
Vicky, tick.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.225
Tortoise wedding, whoop-whoop!

29:54.292 --> 29:55.426
Rejoice!

29:55.493 --> 29:58.863
I see Holly in a white dress
walking down the aisle,

29:58.930 --> 30:00.465
fuck me, I'm shitting meself.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.967
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

30:03.034 --> 30:05.403

30:08.006 --> 30:10.008
.

30:29.727 --> 30:31.229
I know.

30:31.296 --> 30:35.466
Sheldon's gonna be shell deep
in Michelle's fanny.

30:35.533 --> 30:39.871
I can't believe that today is the
tortoise wedding, I'm so excited.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.175
So Vicky told us she was with Gary.

30:44.242 --> 30:49.447
I know where Vicky is, she's in the
shag pad with Gary. What the hell?

30:49.514 --> 30:51.482
I thought they hated each other?

30:51.549 --> 30:53.451
What the fuck has happened?

30:59.924 --> 31:04.028
I've woke up this morning...
in bed with Gary.

31:04.095 --> 31:06.664
This is an all-time personal low.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.167
I can't believe it.

31:10.802 --> 31:13.705
Don't act like you've bucked us,
Beadle.

31:13.771 --> 31:15.540
Oh, this is mint.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.741
Oh, my God.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.210
Vicky, tick.
(laughs)

31:26.084 --> 31:27.685
(laughs)

31:27.752 --> 31:32.457
Vicky's had her guard up for years,
but she's only human and this is me.

31:32.523 --> 31:34.993
Fucking hell. Oh, shit.

31:35.994 --> 31:40.365
It's a big day, guys.
You must be nervous as fuck.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.034
You're nervous?
Try waking up next to Vicky.

31:46.771 --> 31:51.843
That was one of the best blow jobs
I've ever had. Well, like, I know.

31:51.909 --> 31:54.379
Oh, you know?
I know.

31:54.445 --> 31:58.149
Me and Holly are in a wicked
situation. We can have great sex

31:58.216 --> 32:02.220
and then wake up the next day and
there's nee drama, it's perfect.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.690
I literally don't wanna leave now.
I've had such a good time.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.260
Is that because of me? You're in
love with me. All because of you.

32:09.327 --> 32:13.331
I'm so pleased Kyle's come into this
house, he's been absolutely amazing

32:13.398 --> 32:17.869
and I feel like even though we've had
sex, I am still really close to him.

32:23.608 --> 32:28.012
It's so important the bride doesn't
see the groom before the big day,

32:28.079 --> 32:31.082
so I'm taking Sheldon
to the lads' room.

32:31.149 --> 32:34.852
# Here comes the groom
Here comes the groom #

32:38.323 --> 32:40.525
We've gotta get Sheldon ready?

32:40.591 --> 32:42.727
What has my life become?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.029
What happened last night?
Both of yous.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.598
I bucked Holly
and she's bossed all over.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.936
We all expected that,
but fucking you and Vicky?

32:52.003 --> 32:54.138
I knaa.
I thought you didn't like her.

32:54.205 --> 32:58.543
Gaz isn't saying much. He needs to
gnash on and tell us what happened

32:58.609 --> 33:00.645
between him and Victor.
Did yous neck on?

33:02.947 --> 33:06.117
I got her in the shag pad,
I necked on with her.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.120
That's further than anyone has got,
so shut the fuck up.

33:12.123 --> 33:17.128
It's time we hopped into our shell
suits and boxed off this wedding.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.201
That is fucking wicked.

33:24.969 --> 33:28.840
Oh, my God. This looks amazing.
It's good, innit?

33:28.906 --> 33:30.942
I never thought I'd see the day

33:31.008 --> 33:34.645
that Gary was tying wedding cans
to his Ferrari,

33:34.712 --> 33:37.081
even if it is
just for a tortoise wedding.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.522
Let's get this right,
I'm outside the house,

33:44.589 --> 33:48.626
tying a "Just married" sign to me car
with Charlotte, awkward.

33:48.693 --> 33:53.264
The whole me and you thing, it was
exactly the same as everyone else's.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.666
It wasn't exactly the same.
It was.

33:55.733 --> 34:00.505
It went on for longer, it was more
intense, it was totally different.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.441
Nobody can ever come close
to what me and Charlotte had,

34:03.508 --> 34:07.678
and for me, finally we're friends
and that is one thing

34:07.745 --> 34:10.782
I never ever thought would
happen, but I'm so happy about.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.850
What you smirking for?

34:12.917 --> 34:16.754
I don't know.
I feel like we should hug.

34:21.025 --> 34:25.963
Well, this is awkward, but I suppose
this is what friends do, hug.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.733
I've gotta go back inside
and write me sign.

34:30.735 --> 34:34.105
Yeah, that was weird, I will erase
that from me memory. (laughs)

34:40.844 --> 34:43.347
Are yous ready, girls?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.216
Yeah.
Good.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.455
We're all looking absolutely dapper
today, dressed to impressed,

34:50.521 --> 34:54.192
the sun's shining, perfect day
for a tortoise wedding.

34:55.993 --> 35:00.331
Time to get this show on the road,
tortoise wedding, whoop-whoop!

35:03.367 --> 35:06.604
I know people say tortoises are slow,
not today cos Sheldon

35:06.671 --> 35:08.673
is riding in with me.

35:15.079 --> 35:18.583
I thought Charlotte had lost the
plot when she threw a funeral

35:18.649 --> 35:21.519
for her fucking fish,
here she is marrying two tortoises

35:21.586 --> 35:23.688
and dressed like a fucking vicar.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.556
Oh, holy Lord,

35:25.623 --> 35:27.725
the Lord is here today.

35:27.792 --> 35:32.096
Holy, holy Lord welcome my child,
holy Lord, to the church of child.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.531
Where do you want us?

35:33.598 --> 35:36.367
Charlotte's stood at the altar
dressed like a vicar.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.836
I'm surprised
she hasn't burst into flames.

35:40.238 --> 35:44.375
Everyone's in place and it's time for
me to walk Michelle down the aisle.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.210
I'm gonna get a bit emotional.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.479
(wedding march plays)

35:48.546 --> 35:53.317
I turn round and I see Holly in a
white dress walking down the aisle.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.052
Fuck me, I'm shitting meself.

35:57.121 --> 36:02.560
Holly in a white wedding dress?
Selfish bitch

36:02.627 --> 36:05.062
is trying to steal
Michelle's thunder!

36:05.129 --> 36:08.533
From here it looks like them two
are getting married. Fuck off!

36:08.599 --> 36:09.967
(laughter)

36:10.034 --> 36:14.505
We are gathered here today
to celebrate and rejoice,

36:14.572 --> 36:18.409
rejoice the high
expectations of love,

36:18.476 --> 36:22.046
Sheldon and Michelle
are about to be united in.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.949
Charlotte seems to think
that she is qualified

36:25.016 --> 36:28.386
to marry these two tortoises
cos she went to a Catholic school,

36:28.452 --> 36:30.421
but she got thrown out of school

36:30.488 --> 36:34.025
for fingering herself
with a frozen sausage at lunchtime.

36:34.091 --> 36:39.163
So without further ado, let's join
these two in holy matrimony

36:39.230 --> 36:42.333
and get Shelly bucked.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.002
Charlotte has just pronounced them
husband and wife,

36:45.069 --> 36:49.140
I don't know whether it's them
tortoises or Kyle and fucking Holly.

36:49.206 --> 36:52.543
You may now kiss the bride.

36:52.610 --> 36:56.414
I have never been more relieved in
my life to see two tortoises kiss.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.317
(girls) Aww.

36:59.383 --> 37:03.221
Put him in there. I feel so happy
we've all played a big part

37:03.287 --> 37:05.856
in Michelle and Sheldon's
special day.

37:05.923 --> 37:08.359
I just hope now
that Sheldon gets some action.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.728
(cheering)

37:10.795 --> 37:14.332
When Holly walks down the aisle,
she's got a grin from ear to ear,

37:14.398 --> 37:17.201
Holly don't get carried away,
this is not your wedding.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.669
Let's get pissed.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.340
# "Happy" - Pharrell Williams

37:22.406 --> 37:23.541
Woo!

37:23.608 --> 37:26.410
I can't believe
after all the ups and downs

37:26.477 --> 37:30.848
and falling outs, it's a tortoise
wedding what brings us together.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.051
That's when you know
that our family is fucked up.

37:34.118 --> 37:37.054
Cheers to everyone for finishing
together. (all) Cheers, everyone.

37:37.121 --> 37:39.590
(cheering)
I love yous all!

37:40.591 --> 37:43.828
I never thought I'd say it,
but the wedding's been mint,

37:43.894 --> 37:46.530
it's brought we together.

37:48.833 --> 37:52.670
The wedding's over, it's time to get
back, pack our shit, and do one.

37:56.407 --> 38:01.812
# "Stay With Me" - Sam Smith

38:01.879 --> 38:05.216
I can't believe I'm packing me bags
to go already.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.153
West side.

38:12.390 --> 38:16.293
These people are me family,
the most important people in my life

38:16.360 --> 38:18.963
and I wouldn't change any of them
for the world.

38:19.030 --> 38:22.099
I love you three... girls.

38:22.166 --> 38:25.569
I love you three girls too.

38:25.636 --> 38:29.273
I love you three girls too. I love
yous more than the boys. Yeah.

Shock. You've had them all in you!

# "All Of Me" - John Legend

38:40.685 --> 38:44.021
I'm feeling so emotional right now,
I have had

38:44.088 --> 38:47.091
one of the best times
of my entire life.

38:47.158 --> 38:51.829
I feel like everyone is so close and
I just can't wait to come back.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.330
See yous all later.

38:53.397 --> 38:56.701
Of course there's been arguments
and cross words

38:56.767 --> 38:59.570
but it wouldn't be this house
without them.

38:59.637 --> 39:03.407
I honestly... I'm going to miss
me family so, so much.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.910
See you guys.
See you later. Take care.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.047
See you soon.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.248
Next time... Next time...

39:13.584 --> 39:14.952
Fuck off, Beadle.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.723
Spot on. It's been a pleasure.
See ya later.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.058
This time around
I've loved every minute

39:21.125 --> 39:23.627
and I feel like
one of the lads again.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.929
Giz a cuddle then.

39:27.231 --> 39:31.202
Despite the massive argument with
Gaz, I still love the kid to bits.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.804
That's it. Everything's cush,
I love ya to bits.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.073
I'm so pleased I made up with him.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.543
See you both.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.813
It's time to leave and saying
goodbye to everyone is awful,

39:42.880 --> 39:45.483
but saying bye to Marnie,
that's the worst.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.721
I hope something will happen with us

39:50.788 --> 39:53.824
and we'll definitely
see each other on the outside.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.192
Bye.
See ya later.

39:58.395 --> 40:02.166
It's been the best time of me life,
I've loved every second of it.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.736
Since Kyle's came in,
I feel so happy when I'm near him,

40:05.803 --> 40:07.571
he just makes me smile.

40:07.638 --> 40:09.306
I'm hoping we'll be really close.

40:12.810 --> 40:13.944
Bye, Marnie.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.281
I couldn't have had it any better.

40:17.348 --> 40:21.919
I've gotten on with the girls. I can
say that we're really good friends.

40:24.755 --> 40:28.959
We might argue, fight, shag,
kiss each other, spoon each other

40:29.026 --> 40:32.329
but we'll always be a massive family,
and we've just made

40:32.396 --> 40:34.431
more crazy memories
to add to the list.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.942
I feel like everyone is so close.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.145
I'm lucky to be in this bubble
with people who I love

40:48.212 --> 40:53.818
and who I actually care about, and I
just don't wanna leave this bubble.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.287
Love you.
Love you.

41:02.993 --> 41:07.398
This time around it felt like
a place where I had no stress,

41:07.464 --> 41:11.135
no drama and it's all
I've ever wanted for so long,

41:11.202 --> 41:15.439
(cries) just to be in there and feel
happy, and laugh and have fun,

41:15.506 --> 41:19.877
and I've finally got it,
and it's just been amazing.

41:30.955 --> 41:34.825
It's time to get mortal,
Geordie Shore style. Come on!

41:34.892 --> 41:36.560
What the fuck?

41:36.627 --> 41:40.931
I recognise him, we've already
shagged, this is awkward.

41:43.067 --> 41:44.535
Yeah, yeah, it's Bijou.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.637
Fuck, sorry I'm late.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.806
This is gonna ruin everything.

41:49.807 --> 41:52.243
Eurgh.
(cheering)

41:52.309 --> 41:53.744
Scotty T is wicked.

41:55.212 --> 41:57.848
Tops are off,
and we're fucking face to face.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.151
(honks)

42:02.853 --> 42:04.822
There's a new boy in the house.

42:04.889 --> 42:08.359
Welcome to the Geordie Shore house,
please enter here or here.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.361
I've lost me house virginity.

42:11.395 --> 42:14.999
Woo! Now I'm being a slut,
a lesbian slut.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.134
(whistles)

42:21.171 --> 42:23.540
(chanting) Iceland, Iceland!

42:23.607 --> 42:26.610
It smells like a fucking sweaty...
(retches)

42:28.479 --> 42:30.547
Oh, my God, why am I kissing Gary?!

42:32.283 --> 42:34.251
I would never do that to you!

42:35.152 --> 42:38.989
What a fucking dick. Kyle's come in
and now I'm a slut again.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.891
Fucking mint.

42:40.958 --> 42:44.828
Order is restored
in the Geordie Shore family.

42:44.895 --> 42:49.266
I'm so glad I've got someone.
You've got me, you'd always have me.

42:50.534 --> 42:54.138
I can't remember being in this house
and everyone being this happy,

42:54.204 --> 42:56.540
it's just amazing.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.909
She's got your vagina on a lead!

42:58.976 --> 43:01.178
Aww, you're so cute.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.746
(laughs)

43:12.957 --> 43:16.026
I'm kissing him.
Oh, my God I've kissed the new boy.

43:27.271 --> 43:31.008
It might be mad, but it's my house.
There's no place I'd rather be.

43:31.075 --> 43:33.077
I feel like we should hug.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.112
.
