Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.421 --> 00:04.456
We're partners.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.082
And D'avin. We're your team...

00:06.174 --> 00:08.506
But I am in love with Pawter.

00:08.634 --> 00:11.592
I'm not your hostage anymore,
Jelco. I'm your liege.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.753
Power looks
good on you, Seyah.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.554
They want to know
what the wall is for?
Show them.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.472
The wall acts
as a giant pacifier.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.300
When they activate it,
everyone in Old Town

00:19.395 --> 00:21.761
becomes some kind of helpless,
happy drone.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.645
Company can do
whatever they want to them.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.857
This is all bad.

JELCO: Seyah Kendry
sends her regards.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.615
JOHN:
You poisoned the rations.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.366
You're gonna kill
all the weak... (SNIFFLES)
And leave the strong.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.905
And then what?
Don't leave me hanging.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.452
(LAUGHS) I don't know.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.782
But I'm pretty sure
that we're gonna stop you.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.083
(WHISPERING)
We're gonna save
Old Town.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.664
Lucy... Where's Johnny?

00:46.839 --> 00:51.674
In the next 48 hours,
airdrops of premium
rations will begin.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.631
Let’s put an end to
Old Town ’3 suffering.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.803

01:58.160 --> 01:59.775
Not until Herin says so!

02:04.041 --> 02:06.953
After all she's
done for Old Town,
this is how you treat her?

02:07.044 --> 02:08.659
What happens to
her is up to her.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.210
Not in my bar, Herin.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.834
Oh, who says it's
your bar anymore?

02:12.008 --> 02:13.794
It's a brand new day
in Old Town.

02:13.926 --> 02:16.884
Wall's down.
People on the streets.
Company's on the run.

02:18.389 --> 02:19.629
Oh, you ready
to talk, finally?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.221
How long was I out?

02:21.559 --> 02:25.802
You know, when we
raided Spring Hill,

02:25.896 --> 02:28.478
we found a lot of things
that Jelco left behind.

02:28.774 --> 02:32.392
Things they liked to use
on Old Towners like us.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.065
To make us talk.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.898
Wow, that's not even
remotely impressive.

02:39.243 --> 02:43.077
lfyou're gonna poison me,
at least make it
glow or something.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.120
Who said anything
about poison?

02:45.374 --> 02:47.990

Where's Liam Jelco?

02:49.879 --> 02:51.585
When we get there,
you keep your mouth shut.

You talk to anyone,

02:53.090 --> 02:54.375
You try to run, I shoot you.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.315
Understand?

03:11.442 --> 03:13.182
I understand.

(GRUNTS)

03:21.118 --> 03:24.986
Jelco? Why would
you think she'd help that
flaming piece of garbage?

03:25.081 --> 03:28.414
Because I saw her
and her partner save him
with my own eyes.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.368
Oh, honey, tell him
that's impossible.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.454
I keep trying, but he
keeps on not listening.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.060

you did poison me.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.187
Not poison. Micro-leeches.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.735
They feed off
the natural enzymes
secreted when you lie.

03:58.823 --> 04:02.315
They go right for the organs.
Like I said,
Jelco has a lot of toys.

I'll do this?

04:12.336 --> 04:15.669
You'll get us past the guards,
maybe even out the door.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.668
But how do you
get us through the armed
mob outside, Pree?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.249

After what happened
in Spring Hill,

The Company
will be retaliating
any minute now.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.078
You need to
start organizing...

04:53.169 --> 04:54.875
What I need?
Let me tell you what I need.

04:56.839 --> 05:00.878
Last night, over 100 people
of Old Town died
in these streets.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.461
Our streets!

05:02.553 --> 05:05.761
So what I need is to
explain to the wives,

05:05.890 --> 05:08.472
the husbands, the children,

05:08.559 --> 05:10.265
how we are going
to get them justice.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.968
By beating
the piss out of me.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.062
By hanging the man
who started it all
with that damn wall.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.480
And ifwe can't do that,

05:16.567 --> 05:20.685
the next best thing
is the bitch who
helped him escape.

05:20.779 --> 05:24.146
Either Jelco hangs today,
or you do.

down enough to hear.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.088
From where?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.844
LUCY: It originates
from the wall, John.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.977
DUTCH: Lucy gave us
audio scramblers so we could
go in and grab you.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.936
And what's that?
Those are schematics

to Arkyn without me?

Right. Bygones. Continue.

LUCY: Once paired with

the wall controls moods.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.913
It can create feelings ranging
from mild depression

stop eating that shit.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.521

08:41.897 --> 08:43.012
Plus, the only way
to take down the wall

08:43.107 --> 08:46.019
is to overload it somehow
or take out its power
source in Spring Hill.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.438

had your secret plan,

but ifyou don't mind,
we'd quite like tojoin.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.736
How? Even ifwe arrest Jelco,
he's got so many
allies inside The Company.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.662
Who said anything
about arresting?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.952
Liam Jelco is
a murderer, a sadist,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.125
and a threat to
everyone in Old Town.

09:05.629 --> 09:09.668
Tonight we
bring down his wall,
and then he dies.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.217
D'AVIN: So, how are we
getting in?

09:14.346 --> 09:16.052
Well, the entry point's
through one of
the old viaducts

09:16.140 --> 09:17.300
they dropped Spring Hill on.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.427
Should still be accessible,
ljust used it two days ago.

09:19.518 --> 09:22.009
Would this be when
you got busted and
thrown into a jail cell?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.557
Well, that plan had kinks,

09:24.648 --> 09:27.936
which were already
made clear to me,
what with the ensuing arrest,

09:28.026 --> 09:29.641
ass-beating,
and friend-berating.

09:29.778 --> 09:30.733
D'AVlN: You mean Dutch?

09:30.821 --> 09:33.233
Nah, you guys will
kiss and make up.
It's what you do.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.314

and we got past it.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.988
I don't know, man. It's weird.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.285
What's weird?

09:40.372 --> 09:43.956
You chose Dr. Crazy-Pants
over our Lady of
Perpetual Ass-kicking.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.955
Have you met Dutch?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.331
Does that sound like her?

09:51.008 --> 09:52.623
No, it does not.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.419
So when are you gonna
man up and ask her
what it's really about?

09:56.513 --> 09:59.346
'Cause it kind of looks
like you already made
the choice anyway.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.518
Let's go over
the entry plan again.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.975
Yeah.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.029
All right, boys are ready.
Let's do this.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.489
Dutch, a second.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.824
I want to say thank you
for the clothes,
for coming to get us.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.077
He lied to me.
He's never done that.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.284
I'm sorry. I asked him to.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.418
lfigured.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.503
And I'm only doing this now,

10:32.591 --> 10:35.048
because to be
perfectly honest,
Seyah Simms,

10:35.636 --> 10:37.046
you're not up forthis.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.839
And ifyou tried to
do this without me,

10:38.931 --> 10:41.013
you'd probably
get yourself killed
and Johnny with you.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.261
I would never ask
him to risk himself.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.552
But you already did.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.223
You're welcome
for the jacket.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.228
Nice color on you.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.072

power generator's
due east from here.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.245
D'AVlN: Dutch, you and Pawter
can take the last stairwell.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.081
That'll take you
into the main hall.
You get Jelco from there.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.243
Trust me, I know the way.
JOHN: Last check.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.547
Everyone have
everything? Comlinks?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.338
DUTCH: Just remember,
we're not here to kill
The Company guards.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.916
All the weapons are set
to stun except for mine.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.755
Mine's for Jelco.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.470
PAWTER: Where is everybody?

11:27.479 --> 11:30.221
DUTCH: Either we're very
lucky or we're very not.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.522
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

11:36.071 --> 11:38.153
DUTCH: John, this whole
damn place is empty.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.400
JOHN: Yeah, here too.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.867
Where'd they
send all the guards?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.282
D'AVlN: Asshole jamboree?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.280
JOHN: (LAUGHS)
Now, why did lever
try to do this alone?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.531
D'AVlN: Right?

11:45.622 --> 11:47.613
Can't be badass and
make your own jokes.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.823
It's just weird.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.449
Oh.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.913
5O Joy, this is the one
that powers the wall.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.381
Looks like the tech
they had on Arkyn.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.132
Just newer.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.048
So why is shit from Arkyn

12:02.139 --> 12:04.676
showing up in the guts
of a Company building?

12:04.766 --> 12:08.725
Hello, I’m Julian,
the Administration
Matrix for Spring Hill.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.313
You appear to be
looking for a way

12:10.397 --> 12:11.853
into one of our
power generators.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.771
Hi, there, little buddy.
We're just looking to bypass

12:13.859 --> 12:15.315
a blown power conduit.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.817
Oh, there it is.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.576
Yeah, it's probably
fastestjust to turn over

12:26.663 --> 12:29.780
all manual controls
of the generators
to me for repairs, huh?

12:29.875 --> 12:32.036
Hmm. That would appear to be
the most efficient solution.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.833
See? Computers love me.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.414
Except that Spring Hill
is in the midst

12:35.505 --> 12:37.666
of a Company-mandated,
system-wide changeover.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.173
Whoa, whoa.
"Changeover"? Since when?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.421
So you will need a deca-set
encrypted access code

12:42.512 --> 12:43.888
if you wish to
proceed further,

12:43.972 --> 12:46.349
which you would know
if you really belonged here.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.843
Unless you think I’m stupid.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.259
Do you think I’m stupid?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.227
You were saying?
Wow.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.061
Whoever programed
this is an asshole.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.688
Yeah, well, my asshole's
bigger than his asshole.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.271
I mean you're smarter than...

13:02.366 --> 13:04.277
Whatever,
just kick his nerd ass.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.357
(CHUCKLES)

13:06.411 --> 13:07.571
Uh... (SNlFFS)

13:07.788 --> 13:08.777
(GROANS)

13:09.539 --> 13:11.495
Look, ifyou want to
stop here, you still can.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.494
You don't have
anything to prove to me.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.995
Well, like my father told me,

13:15.253 --> 13:17.869
sometimes we have choices,
and sometimes we don't.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.378
What am I
supposed to do with this?

13:22.552 --> 13:26.670
You point this part,
you pull this part,
and bang, bad guy falls down.

13:26.807 --> 13:27.842
lt's set to lethal,

13:27.933 --> 13:29.639
soiflcanttake
the shot at Jelco,
you're gonna have to.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.387
I can't just shoot someone.
Really?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.888
You cut off your
own sister's hand

13:32.980 --> 13:34.186
and strapped
a bomb to Jelco's heart.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.058
Yes, but
I didn't set it off.

13:36.817 --> 13:37.897
There's a difference.
I'm a doctor.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.896
Anything bad I've
done was to save a life,
not take one.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.397
Well, sometimes
you got to do both.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.152
This is what I mean.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.947
You play at rebellion,
'cause John will
do your dirty work.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.150
Johnny made
his own decisions.
He chose a side.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.985
He's a Killjoy,
he doesn't take sides.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.911
Well, maybe he wants to be
more than just a Killjoy.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.411
Why would you think that?
Because he told me.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.419
DUTCH: Okay, seriously,
what the hells is going on?

14:03.719 --> 14:05.584
Group nap? Company retreat?

14:05.679 --> 14:08.421
JOHN: Ladies,
we may have a little problem.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.676
lam completely
blocked out
of the generator.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.349
There's no way that
I can shut down power
to the wall from here.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.098
Have you tried
shooting the dick out of it?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.268
What, the generator?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.146
(SCOFFS) No, these puppies
are proteck-packed
and chained.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.225
Each one would go up like
a mini-nuke on Ascension Day.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.855
Not advisable.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.102
You guys at Jelco's yet?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.234
Yeah, but no Jelco.
Whole place looks
like it's been evacuated.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.826
JOH N: Apparent/y,
Spring Hill is in the midst

14:28.910 --> 14:30.161
of a system-wide changeover.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.528
Doesn't that sound
incredibly ominous?

14:32.622 --> 14:34.487
Handed over to who?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.574
Forget it. I don't care
about bureaucratic bullshit.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.908
Just give me a Plan B.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.619
Senbek told me
that the wall controls
are in Jelco's office.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.376
Maybe you can
at least turn off
the neural interference.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.423
Shut down the mood control.
How?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.712
Look at Jelco's desk.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.297
I got it.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.920
JOHN:
No, hold on! There might be...

14:55.812 --> 14:58.189

Of course it's you.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.972
Why not? Cherry on my day.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.393
He probably means me.
I think he means me.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.191
Well, you're too late.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.893
Sorry I can't be
there to say good-bye.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.695
Bit of a changing of the guard
situation happening here.

15:07.783 --> 15:08.898
Schedule's quite tight.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.232
Where are you, Jelco?

15:10.327 --> 15:12.409
l have a very special package
with your name on it.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.324
Tempting. But I've got
something for you instead.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.580
Four squads,
top floor, immediately.

15:17.751 --> 15:18.911
MAN: Uh, Governor Jelco, sir,

15:19.002 --> 15:21.869

have all been dispatched

15:21.963 --> 15:23.089
to the next colony.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.747
Who's left?
F Squad.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.217
Then send in F Squad.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.423
Must I do everything myself?

15:27.511 --> 15:28.717

to chew your food?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.509

hear the same alarm
as me, Johnny?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.519
Yeah, I'm also seeing a lot of
guards coming your way.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.399
All right, then,
safest way out.
On it.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.728
But Dutch, that holocall
you just received from Jelco,

15:47.823 --> 15:50.030
that same frequency
is making
another call to Qresh.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.907
And it's coming from
inside Spring Hill.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.823
Bugger's still in
the building. Good.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.030
Track that signal.
Tell me where he is,
and D'av,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.114
I’ll need a distraction.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.198
Keep those guards
off my ass.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.874
Man with gun, coming at ya.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.002
Dutch, wait.
We came here to
bring down the wall.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.080
And get Jelco's
brains on toast.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.710
I'm not leaving
here without both.

16:07.843 --> 16:08.958
You and John
work the wall.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.633

Jelco and the guards.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.096

16:13.056 --> 16:15.092
What if the guards
get here first?

16:15.183 --> 16:16.764
If anyone comes
through that door

16:16.852 --> 16:18.388

32:09.929 --> 32:12.386
Sorry, massive blood
loss and nerve cuffs

32:12.473 --> 32:14.805
brings out
the sentimental bitch in me.

32:14.892 --> 32:15.881
(CHUCKLES)

32:19.855 --> 32:22.938
You always go with
your big, stupid heart.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.482
lt scares me.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.311
That's why you got into
all that trouble with Pawter.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.649
Yeah.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.364
Well, Pawter can get
into her own trouble.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.161
She took down
the wall by having
people run at it,

32:38.249 --> 32:39.739
until it shorted out.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.580
She made them do it.

32:43.671 --> 32:44.786
Dutch.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.212
People died.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.042
There are two kinds
of people who can
take down a wall like that.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.965
Those that die on it,

32:54.056 --> 32:55.717
and those that kill for it.

32:56.559 --> 32:59.847
Don't assume you
know which one you are
until you face that moment.

32:59.937 --> 33:02.098
And since when do
you take Pawter's side?

33:04.275 --> 33:06.641
Since I know what
it's like to need you.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.566
There's a monster
inside me, Johnny.

33:12.241 --> 33:16.234
And it's angry.
And it's hateful.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.871
And you're the only one
who stops it from coming out.

33:22.543 --> 33:25.535
That's why I've been
so scared to lose you.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.290
I just want you
to be happy.

33:27.423 --> 33:28.788
What makes me happy
is to live in a world

33:28.883 --> 33:30.965
where I can have my Dutch
and eat my Pawter too.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.590
Shit.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.420
That... That got
weirdly sexual.
Yeah.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.971
No. lt'sjust,
we're not baked goods.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.018
I know that.
(CHUCKLES)

33:41.228 --> 33:42.764
| just meant...

33:43.355 --> 33:45.016
Everything is gonna be fine.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.312
I promise.

33:50.613 --> 33:53.320
Please, tell him
what he wants to know.
HERIN: Time's up.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.403
Fine.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.199
I'll tell you
where Jelco is.

34:01.749 --> 34:02.955
I sent him away
with my partner,

34:03.042 --> 34:04.202
and I've been
stalling ever since

34:04.293 --> 34:07.660
to buy them time
to blow up Spring Hill
once it was evacuated.

34:11.133 --> 34:13.624
You only get one shot,
boys. Make it count.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.343
I'll be happy
to do the honors.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.968
Not a chance.
Just put in the codes.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.465
Hmm.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.182
Why do you get all the fun?

34:27.483 --> 34:29.565
Why would you want to
blow up Spring Hill?

34:29.652 --> 34:32.064
Because it's being used
to turn Old Town survivors

34:32.154 --> 34:33.769
into immortal
killing machines.

34:34.073 --> 34:35.483
(CHUCKLES)

34:35.991 --> 34:37.822
That's the best one yet.
I'll give you that.

34:38.535 --> 34:39.615
Am I bleeding?

34:51.632 --> 34:52.667
D'AVlN: Bestjob ever.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.351
She hangs, now.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.472
Hey, whoa, whoa.
She told you what
this is all about.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.978
She told you the truth.

35:08.148 --> 35:10.275
Johnny.
So she played you.
It happens.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.350
And now you're
gonna suck it up,
and you're gonna let her go.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.559
DUTCH: Johnny.

35:14.029 --> 35:17.021
You don't whip up
an angry mob and then
just tell them to go home.

35:17.992 --> 35:20.699
One way or another,
someone was always gonna hang.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.027
(GRUNTS)

35:24.206 --> 35:25.286
Nobody hangs today.

35:25.541 --> 35:26.496
Crowd wants blood, son.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.960
Hers or yours,
with a rope or bullet,
they don't care.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.997
It's gonna take
a lot of your blood, too.

35:31.088 --> 35:33.670
'Cause I'm not leaving
this woman's side, ever.

35:35.134 --> 35:38.046
Well, I hope you're not
doing all this on my account.

35:40.014 --> 35:44.633
It'd be a waste
to spill so much blood
when I'm here to negotiate

35:44.727 --> 35:46.843
for Westerley's independence.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.443
So just like that?
Independence.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.362
Well, after Seyah Simms here

35:59.450 --> 36:02.613
broadcast that horrific scene
in Old Town across the Quad,

36:02.703 --> 36:05.319
don't I suddenly get a call
from over 30 mining chiefs

36:05.414 --> 36:08.656
whose towns will go
into open and violent revolt

36:08.751 --> 36:11.163
if The Company tried
to put up another wall
anywhere near them.

36:11.587 --> 36:14.920
Needless to say,
I know when I'm beat.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.665
Hey.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.002
(EXHALES)
You okay?

36:21.138 --> 36:22.503
It's all right.
I'm all right.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.429
Good, 'cause
you look like shit.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.974
And growing up, they said
that he was the ladies' man.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.350
Is our friend safe?

36:28.437 --> 36:31.144
Yeah, he will be
if he shuts up
for 10 seconds.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.359
Just keep him on Lucy
and don't mention
him to anyone here.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.024
And don't drink the water.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.362
We'll need to take this
to the people of Old Town.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.030
Of course. We'll draw up
an accord for us all to sign.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.616
I wouldn't trust
anything she does.
SEYAH: Which is smart.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.778
But that's why I came alone.
No bodyguard even.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.990
You won, Pawter.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.746
I didn't know
you had it in you.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.462
Your mother would
have been very proud.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.507
Don't talk about
my mother. Ever.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.466
You two need
a second alone here, or...

37:05.557 --> 37:07.468
It's too bad
she's not here anymore.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.228
But you are. For now.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.718
What does that mean?

37:11.814 --> 37:13.554
It means, Pawter Simms,
the freeing of Westerley

37:13.649 --> 37:15.810
will cost
The Company trillions.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.483
But it will cost you

37:18.654 --> 37:20.645
something even more dear.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.188
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

37:24.076 --> 37:26.408
JOHN: So all of Westerley
saw what happened at the wall.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.826
That's why you did it.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.406
That's what
made them stand up,

37:29.498 --> 37:30.863
but that doesn't
make it right.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.825
And when we sign
the accord, I will answer
for what I've done.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.001
Okay, but you don't
have to do it alone.
I mean, I can talk to...

37:36.088 --> 37:37.123
Johnny,no.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.330
You've already
risked too much.
You can't keep doing this.

37:39.550 --> 37:40.756
(CHUCKLES)

37:40.843 --> 37:42.879
This is, like, an entire day
of the women I love telling me

37:42.970 --> 37:45.006
what I can and can't do.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.804
It's not really as fun
as it sounds, Seyah Simms.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.427
Well, when the accord
has been signed,

37:49.518 --> 37:51.008
you won't be
calling me that anymore.

37:51.979 --> 37:52.968
Why not?

37:54.189 --> 37:57.056
Because the deal
Delle Seyah made is that
if Westerley gets all this,

37:57.151 --> 38:01.941
l have to give up my title,
my land, my place on
the Board, everything.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.399
VVhy?

38:03.490 --> 38:04.525
'Cause I beat her.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.073
This is her way of
making me pay for that.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.489
You can fight this.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.905
I don't think I want to.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.663
I'm done playing
politics, Johnny.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.585
It costs too much.

38:23.427 --> 38:25.383
l have to go back in there.
Hey, hey, hey.

38:28.432 --> 38:32.095
As long as l have a home,
you have a home.

38:32.895 --> 38:35.557
Maybe you could be
our doc on the ship.

38:36.023 --> 38:37.888
We could use one,
we get hurt a lot.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.857
Which is maybe not the best
recruitment speech, but...

38:42.571 --> 38:43.902
Are you serious?

38:45.115 --> 38:48.983
Well, lwas kind
of hoping to settle down
with Qreshian royalty, but...

38:49.495 --> 38:50.780
(CHUCKLES)
You know.

39:09.598 --> 39:10.758
Old custom.

39:11.892 --> 39:12.881
(GRUNTS)

39:14.269 --> 39:15.384
I've heard of this.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.596
How charmingly
disgusting.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.432
Thank you, Dr. Pawter,

39:22.194 --> 39:23.775
for freeing Old Town.

39:24.238 --> 39:26.103
lfyou're sure,
Seyah Simms.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.551
Oh, pretty Pawter.

39:51.265 --> 39:52.254
(GROANS)

39:53.141 --> 39:55.268
No,no,no,no,no!
Kill them all.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.644
(PANTING)

40:03.527 --> 40:05.142
Pawter,
you're fine, you're fine.

40:05.362 --> 40:06.397
(GASPING)

40:06.488 --> 40:07.477
Shit, Shit.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.653
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.613
(ALL GRUNTING)

40:12.411 --> 40:14.823
Pawter, you need
to tell me what to do, okay?

40:15.414 --> 40:16.494
Stay with me.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.583
Tell me how to help you, okay?

40:20.043 --> 40:22.125
It's gonna be okay.
All right?

40:22.337 --> 40:23.838
DUTCH: They won't stay down!

40:29.636 --> 40:30.625
Hey!

40:32.598 --> 40:33.587
(GASPING)

40:34.558 --> 40:35.547
Hey.

40:40.814 --> 40:41.849
Come on!

40:42.858 --> 40:44.018
There's too many.
We gotta go.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.269
Johnny”.
No, she's gonna be fine.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.359
D'AVlN: Johnny,
we have to go now.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.110
They're Sixes.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.231
DUTCH: D'av!
Sorry, buddy.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.911
SEYAH: He even
handed over the knife
like you said he would.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.492
Old habits die
hard in Old Town.

41:01.543 --> 41:02.828
Give me the other one.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.373
HERIN: Uncle.

41:12.054 --> 41:13.214
How could you?

41:14.389 --> 41:15.378
Your own people...

41:15.974 --> 41:17.805
You're not my people.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.600
HERIN: What did she offer you?

41:20.979 --> 41:24.597
Only what we all want,
Herin. To live forever.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.056
(GROANS)

41:32.741 --> 41:34.777
What will you tell
the rest of Old Town?

41:35.285 --> 41:37.367
What they need
to hear, of course.

41:39.665 --> 41:43.283
Old Town, she loved
you as you loved her.

41:43.377 --> 41:47.290
She was our bridge
from Qresh to Westerley,
from my people to yours.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.042
/ pledge to be
that bridge now.

41:49.383 --> 41:54.173
Before she died,
Pawter did manage
to write this,

41:54.429 --> 41:56.841
a Qreshi peace agreement.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.423
Let there be no
more walls between us.

41:59.810 --> 42:02.927
We are one. Forever.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.808
And nothing will ever
tear us apart again.

42:07.109 --> 42:08.064
Okay.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.186
All right, Lucy.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.563
Get us out of here before
the Scarbacks catch up.

42:11.655 --> 42:14.362
As soon as Jelco could
tell us where the rest
of the plasma is, we...

42:14.449 --> 42:15.564
(GASPS)

42:16.785 --> 42:19.492
FANCY: I let him go,
but we had some fun first.

42:20.414 --> 42:21.529
DUTCH: You idiot.

42:21.915 --> 42:24.702
We have just lost
the best chance we have
to save the Quad.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.079
I don't think
Khlyen would agree.

42:28.463 --> 42:29.919
"Khlyen"?

42:30.132 --> 42:31.793
What does he have
to do with this?

42:32.801 --> 42:35.417
I guess you'll just have
to come with me to find out.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.632
He's waiting.
