07:50.583 --> 07:52.291
Help!

08:24.666 --> 08:27.166
We need your father's email address.

08:27.916 --> 08:28.916
Stay calm.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.416
Your father's email address.

08:33.457 --> 08:34.750
Do you understand?

08:39.750 --> 08:43.332
Breathe calmly. In and out.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.708
Your father's email address.

08:48.541 --> 08:51.666
Your father's email address.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.833
Martin... M...

08:57.791 --> 08:59.833
at aol.de.

09:03.916 --> 09:07.375
And the mobile phone number.
Mobile phone number.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.666
0160...

09:10.583 --> 09:11.666
928...

09:12.958 --> 09:15.666
40184.

09:15.958 --> 09:16.958
Again.

09:17.833 --> 09:21.541
0160928...

09:23.250 --> 09:25.333
40184.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.791
Is everything okay?

09:55.875 --> 09:56.875
Yes.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.791
Put her cell with the other stuff.
We might still need it.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.083
COPYING FILES TO REMOVABLE MEDIA

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
Check every ten minutes.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.958
Okay.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.583
Lock the door behind me.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.208
Help. Help me!

11:54.625 --> 11:55.750
Was the email correct?

11:56.958 --> 11:58.083
No reply.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.541
Is she all right?

12:03.625 --> 12:04.625
Yes, all good.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.291
She needs to drink.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.166
You need fluids.

12:59.916 --> 13:01.916
We'll take out the gag so you can drink.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.333
When we do that,
we don't want you to bite, spit or scream.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.875
Otherwise, we'll have to sedate you
and do it a different way.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.875
Nod if you've understood this.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.166
We don't want to hurt or kill you.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.333
But we're ready to do so at any time.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.333
You got that?

13:23.708 --> 13:26.333
I will now take the gag out.
Are you going to scream?

13:32.958 --> 13:34.958
Help! Hey!

13:35.041 --> 13:38.291
Nobody will hear you.
Nobody will help you.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.833
We're the only ones
who can get you out of here.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.125
We're your only friends now.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.500
Look at me.

13:45.875 --> 13:46.875
You understand?

13:50.583 --> 13:51.983
Will you scream
when I move my hand?

14:15.375 --> 14:16.375
Very good.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.125
We'll look after you.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.291
When you need to use the bathroom,
do this:

14:29.375 --> 14:31.958
One finger for peeing, two for number two.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.916
Eat. You need energy.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.583
- I'm not hungry.
- Doesn't matter, eat.

16:50.833 --> 16:51.666
Tom, please eat.

16:51.750 --> 16:52.916
No, I really can't.

17:03.750 --> 17:04.750
What?

17:09.290 --> 17:10.290
Eat.

17:11.665 --> 17:12.790
I said I'm not hungry.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.665
You'll eat now.

17:19.583 --> 17:22.290
Okay.

17:34.583 --> 17:35.750
I said I'm not hungry.

17:35.833 --> 17:39.458
You haven't eaten in nine hours.
You worked hard, but you're not hungry?

17:39.541 --> 17:40.541
No.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.041
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

17:44.791 --> 17:47.166
You have to be honest or this won't work.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.541
- Yes.
- You know how long I've planned this.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.666
I'm just not hungry.

17:55.833 --> 18:00.375
If you're not hungry, your emotions
are suppressing your appetite.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.375
Which means you're thinking too much.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.138
About whether we're doing
everything right.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.083
Whether we've made a mistake
that will send us back to prison.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.958
Whether she can identify us,
because then we're screwed.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.875
We'd have to kill her.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.875
Or you're becoming soft,
now that we're really doing it.

18:20.958 --> 18:24.125
You have doubts. You wonder
whether we should let her go. Now.

18:25.791 --> 18:29.250
End it before it gets too complicated
to stop. Now while we still can.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.166
Forget it, okay?

18:35.166 --> 18:36.166
Forget it.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.291
You and I will push through this.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.833
It's like prison.
You can't get out anymore.

18:41.916 --> 18:43.916
This is the plan
and the plan is happening now.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.250
Doubting it is bullshit
and you know that. Say it.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.583
What?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.125
We will do this.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.375
- We will do this.
- Say it again.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.333
We will do this.

19:03.666 --> 19:04.666
Good.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.375
Now eat. It will be a long night.

19:23.916 --> 19:25.541
What will you do with the money?

19:32.208 --> 19:33.208
None of your business.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.791
Okay. It's starting.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.083
Check every ten minutes, okay?

19:46.166 --> 19:49.125
The gag isn't safe
and we don't want her to choke, right?

19:55.958 --> 19:57.078
And lock the door behind me.

23:46.916 --> 23:47.916
I can't!

23:51.625 --> 23:53.041
Please give me some privacy.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.291
Could you go outside?

23:57.875 --> 23:59.083
Then turn around.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.416
Please.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.708
Please.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.625
Stop. Give me the gun.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.291
Set me free or I'll shoot you.

24:27.375 --> 24:28.375
Okay, calm down.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.458
I'll give you the keys.

24:30.541 --> 24:32.500
- Throw them over here.
- Wait.

24:32.583 --> 24:36.000
- Throw them over here.
- Calm down. I'll give them to you.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.416
- Stop right there.
- Take them, here.

24:39.458 --> 24:40.291
Take them.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.125
No! Stop right there!

24:42.208 --> 24:43.500
- Take them.
- Stop!

24:49.750 --> 24:50.750
Tom?

24:51.250 --> 24:52.666
Give me the gun.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.208
What are you doing here?

24:55.291 --> 24:56.291
Give it to me.

24:56.666 --> 24:59.250
Wait. You did this?

25:00.625 --> 25:01.833
Why?

25:03.541 --> 25:04.541
Are you serious?

25:05.791 --> 25:08.750
You know exactly why.
You ruined my life.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.291
So you kidnap me?

25:13.541 --> 25:14.541
Let me go.

25:15.083 --> 25:15.916
No.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.083
Let me go!

25:18.166 --> 25:20.791
No, the plan has started.
Now give me the gun.

25:22.583 --> 25:23.791
Okay, Tom.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.235
- Wait a second.
- Give me the gun.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.875
Wait, I have to tell you something. Tom!

25:32.666 --> 25:33.666
No!

26:09.291 --> 26:12.916
It's your fault. You left me alone.

26:22.583 --> 26:23.583
And shut your face.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.083
If Vic finds out that we know each other,
if he notices anything, you're dead.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.750
Shit.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.583
Hey. Did everything work out?

27:07.833 --> 27:08.833
Yes.

27:12.541 --> 27:13.583
Is she okay?

27:14.833 --> 27:16.291
She's fine, I was just in there.

27:16.708 --> 27:17.708
Okay.

27:20.250 --> 27:21.250
He doesn't want to pay.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.708
Shit.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
He will.

27:28.458 --> 27:29.458
You have to sleep.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.541
What? I can't sleep now.

27:31.625 --> 27:34.250
You need to rest.
Tomorrow will be exhausting.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.125
And who will check?

27:37.666 --> 27:38.666
Me.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.250
Lie down.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.333
If you say so.

28:11.541 --> 28:12.541
Sleep well.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.333
Tom.

28:32.625 --> 28:33.625
Wake up.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.625
Get up, I need you now.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.291
She might bleed.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.208
Stay focused.

28:42.583 --> 28:43.416
Okay, but...

28:43.500 --> 28:44.875
Just stay focused.

28:47.750 --> 28:48.750
Get the camera.

29:20.458 --> 29:24.833
No matter how well you're prepared,
unexpected things can happen at any time.

29:25.833 --> 29:28.916
You then have to improvise
and make the best out of the situation.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.125
Or you have a plan B.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.166
We have a plan B.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.791
Your father doesn't want to pay.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.958
So, we will show him again exactly

29:40.625 --> 29:41.625
what this is about.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.708
We will...

29:44.500 --> 29:47.250
amputate your left pinky finger
just above the middle joint.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.750
No!

29:49.833 --> 29:51.041
- No!
- It will hurt.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.958
But it's not life-threatening.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.875
You won't lose much blood
and we will store the finger

29:59.208 --> 30:00.583
in here, cooled.

30:02.125 --> 30:05.125
The finger can be sewn on again
within 24 hours.

30:05.833 --> 30:06.833
If your father pays.

30:08.791 --> 30:10.625
No! No!

30:11.916 --> 30:13.000
Turn the camera on.

30:19.333 --> 30:22.500
Please don't!

30:22.583 --> 30:24.375
Tell your father.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.666
Tell your father.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.625
No!

30:31.416 --> 30:36.208
They'll cut my finger off.
Please do as they say.

30:36.958 --> 30:39.041
Help me, Dad.

30:40.750 --> 30:42.833
Please don't. No.

30:43.750 --> 30:49.333
Dad, I love you and I'm sorry
we fought so often.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.375
Please help me.

30:52.916 --> 30:56.791
Dad! Dad, I'm pregnant.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.333
Four months pregnant.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.291
Please don't leave me alone.

31:04.625 --> 31:06.375
Please don't leave me alone.

31:06.750 --> 31:07.875
Please help me.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.208
Please don't!

31:12.291 --> 31:13.833
No!

31:13.916 --> 31:14.916
I think that's enough.

31:22.583 --> 31:24.208
Please...

31:49.041 --> 31:51.000
- Don't do that again.
- What?

31:51.625 --> 31:52.625
I decide.

31:53.166 --> 31:54.166
Okay.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.458
But we had what we needed.

32:10.458 --> 32:11.833
<i>No!</i>

32:12.458 --> 32:13.458
<i>No!</i>

32:14.333 --> 32:17.500
<i>Hello... Hello, Dad...</i>

32:24.791 --> 32:26.041
<i>No!</i>

32:26.791 --> 32:31.500
<i>No! Dad... I'm pregnant.</i>

32:32.708 --> 32:34.208
<i>Four months pregnant.</i>

32:34.875 --> 32:36.083
<i>Please!</i>

32:36.833 --> 32:39.375
<i>Help me!</i>

32:42.833 --> 32:46.750
<i>Please don't! Please! Do as they say.</i>

32:54.583 --> 32:55.583
It works.

32:56.875 --> 32:57.875
Okay.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.416
She was a great choice.

33:02.708 --> 33:03.833
Yes.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.500
You need vitamins.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.166
Tom.

33:30.833 --> 33:31.833
What?

33:32.041 --> 33:33.041
Your mask.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.166
Right.

34:08.583 --> 34:09.666
You need to eat.

34:16.958 --> 34:17.958
This is minestrone.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.375
It's still hot.

34:30.625 --> 34:31.666
I want him to feed me.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.500
No.

34:40.708 --> 34:41.708
I'll do it.

34:48.666 --> 34:49.666
Come on.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.541
This will be over soon.

35:23.041 --> 35:24.166
What is it?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
What's up?

35:28.375 --> 35:29.375
Nothing.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.250
You see?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.458
If you play along, it's easier.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.708
What are you doing?

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
Go back.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.166
What are you doing?

36:48.666 --> 36:49.708
Give me that.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.000
I told you to give me that.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.250
Tie her up again.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.291
What's wrong?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.208
Nothing.

37:35.958 --> 37:36.791
Sure?

37:36.875 --> 37:37.958
Yes.

37:38.833 --> 37:39.666
Something's wrong.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.083
No, I'm just a little nervous.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.000
Why?

37:43.083 --> 37:44.791
Because of the excitement.

37:48.041 --> 37:49.250
You need to stay focused, Tom.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.708
I am.

37:53.541 --> 37:55.333
- Completely.
- You sure?

37:58.583 --> 38:00.083
I'm 100 percent fine.

38:04.833 --> 38:05.833
Pull yourself together.

38:07.125 --> 38:08.125
Sure.

38:18.625 --> 38:19.625
Where are you going?

38:21.291 --> 38:22.666
For a piss. Is that okay?

39:21.541 --> 39:22.375
Tom?

39:22.458 --> 39:23.458
Yes?

39:28.958 --> 39:30.208
Tom?

39:33.416 --> 39:34.541
Tom, what's wrong?

39:35.250 --> 39:36.583
Nothing. Everything's okay.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.041
You sure?

39:38.541 --> 39:40.458
Yes. I'll be done in a second.

39:47.208 --> 39:48.208
Tom!

39:48.791 --> 39:50.291
Open the door!

39:52.000 --> 39:53.041
What are you doing?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.125
Nothing.

39:55.666 --> 39:57.625
Open the goddamn door!

39:58.708 --> 39:59.708
Tom!

40:01.916 --> 40:02.916
Tom!

40:03.833 --> 40:04.875
I'm coming in.

40:09.625 --> 40:10.625
What the fuck?

40:11.083 --> 40:12.833
Why didn't you open the door?
I was worried.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.533
I told you. I was almost done.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.041
I couldn't get rid of it.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.875
I thought you only had to pee.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.083
I thought so, too.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.666
I can't smell anything.

40:27.416 --> 40:28.625
My digestion is fine.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.500
Damn, my shit just doesn't stink.

41:01.416 --> 41:02.500
It's the adrenaline.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.500
Having to shit suddenly and the bitter
taste in your mouth. It's the adrenaline.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.208
I used to have it. All the time.

41:12.666 --> 41:13.791
Really?

41:15.416 --> 41:17.333
It will stop. Relax.

41:20.166 --> 41:21.291
I'll send him the video,

41:21.375 --> 41:23.095
then I'll call him
and tell him the details.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.750
Then it will start.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.375
Once I'm back, we have to act quickly.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.541
We'll take her out
and downstairs to the van.

41:38.875 --> 41:41.041
In two days, this shit will be over.

41:43.291 --> 41:44.458
For good.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
It will be over.

42:05.291 --> 42:08.041
We'll be free and rich.

42:11.416 --> 42:12.416
Sounds good.

42:15.708 --> 42:16.750
We'll pull it off.

42:18.458 --> 42:20.291
- Yes.
- Sure?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Sure.

43:10.166 --> 43:11.375
Why are you lying?

43:12.416 --> 43:13.500
- What?
- The pregnancy.

43:13.583 --> 43:14.958
Why should I believe that shit?

43:16.250 --> 43:17.291
Forget it.

43:18.458 --> 43:19.708
Tom, wait.

43:23.625 --> 43:24.625
Feel it.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.041
Come.

43:33.083 --> 43:34.083
Come.

43:36.541 --> 43:37.541
Feel it.

43:56.666 --> 43:57.666
Feel it.

44:04.166 --> 44:05.166
Properly.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.083
Sometimes I can already feel it.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.083
A little.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.166
Can you feel something?

44:26.208 --> 44:27.208
I feel nothing.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.625
Because there is nothing.
Because you are lying again.

44:31.708 --> 44:33.458
- Tom.
- Shut up.

44:34.583 --> 44:36.375
And why didn't you tell me?

44:38.375 --> 44:39.458
Because I didn't want to.

44:40.833 --> 44:44.833
Because you had disappeared again.
Running around with someone, as always?

44:45.333 --> 44:48.083
And then you were gone for good.
In prison.

44:51.416 --> 44:52.416
Tom.

44:53.375 --> 44:54.375
Where is the other guy?

44:56.166 --> 44:57.166
He's gone.

44:58.208 --> 44:59.125
Calling someone.

44:59.208 --> 45:00.416
When will he be back?

45:01.666 --> 45:02.916
Half an hour. Maybe sooner.

45:04.875 --> 45:07.500
- You didn't tell him we know each other?
- Of course not.

45:09.333 --> 45:12.166
I told him I read your name
in an article about your father.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.083
What?

45:13.166 --> 45:15.208
He loved it and said you were perfect.

45:16.250 --> 45:19.291
Wealthy father, female, young, only child.

45:19.375 --> 45:20.375
What?

45:20.791 --> 45:23.208
- You fulfilled all the criteria.
- Criteria?

45:23.291 --> 45:26.833
Vic has been planning this forever.
He talked about nothing else in jail.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.378
When we got out,
we started looking for a victim.

45:30.875 --> 45:32.166
And you suggested me?

45:32.583 --> 45:33.583
Yes.

45:34.083 --> 45:37.875
Have you gone completely mad? What? Why?

45:37.958 --> 45:42.791
I was in jail.
I was waiting for you every fucking day.

45:42.875 --> 45:46.583
No visit, no explanation, nothing!
Fuck you, Stella!

45:46.666 --> 45:48.416
I should have known not to trust you.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.250
Exactly!

45:51.375 --> 45:54.541
Open your eyes for once, Tom!
It's always somebody else's fault.

45:55.541 --> 45:58.541
You promised
you would stop with all this shit.

45:58.625 --> 46:00.916
The burglaries, your fucked-up friends.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.375
And then suddenly the cops
come to my place and arrest you.

46:03.458 --> 46:05.250
That's when you said you'd help me.

46:05.333 --> 46:07.000
Well, what should I have done?

46:08.541 --> 46:10.166
When I found out I was pregnant,

46:10.250 --> 46:13.041
I knew you were not good for me
or the child.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.458
And I know you. You can't be trusted, Tom.

46:17.916 --> 46:20.416
As soon as there is a problem,
you're gone.

46:20.500 --> 46:23.416
Exactly. But with that kind of money,
I can leave for good.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.625
That's the plan? That's shit.

46:25.708 --> 46:26.833
Really?

46:27.500 --> 46:30.458
Shall I apply for something
with prison on my CV and work my way up?

46:31.041 --> 46:32.041
Forget it.

46:33.541 --> 46:37.208
But your father is a rich asshole who
doesn't even spend money on his daughter.

46:37.291 --> 46:39.250
Not even for her ransom.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.083
How will we get out of here?

46:45.291 --> 46:47.666
Tom, what about our child?

46:47.916 --> 46:50.666
Stop it. You don't even
believe it yourself.

46:50.750 --> 46:52.041
Okay, then take a look.

46:52.416 --> 46:54.958
Look at the doctor's appointments
on my cell phone.

47:20.041 --> 47:21.416
Forget it.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.875
If I put the battery in there,
the police can locate it.

47:25.458 --> 47:26.778
But obviously you know that, too.

47:28.541 --> 47:29.541
Tom!

47:35.333 --> 47:36.333
Stella!

47:39.208 --> 47:40.333
Stella.

47:45.125 --> 47:46.583
Wait a second.

48:01.791 --> 48:02.791
Stella?

48:04.458 --> 48:05.625
Stella, are you okay?

48:07.583 --> 48:09.041
Come on, sit up.

49:06.708 --> 49:09.583
No, please don't!

49:10.625 --> 49:12.583
Stella, please don't do that.
I'm sorry, okay?

49:14.541 --> 49:16.916
No. Stella! Please don't!

49:17.791 --> 49:18.875
Stella, stay here!

49:25.583 --> 49:28.000
Stella, come back!

49:34.750 --> 49:36.125
Help!

49:36.708 --> 49:38.208
Stella!

49:48.166 --> 49:49.166
Stella!

49:49.458 --> 49:50.291
Shit.

49:50.375 --> 49:51.375
Stella, stay here!

49:53.625 --> 49:54.916
No!

50:00.541 --> 50:02.375
Stella, you're killing both of us!

50:02.958 --> 50:03.791
<i>Berlin Police.</i>

50:03.875 --> 50:05.166
- Hello?
- Stella!

50:05.250 --> 50:07.583
I was kidnapped.
My name is Stella Mertens.

50:07.666 --> 50:08.541
Shit!

50:08.625 --> 50:09.708
I'm locked up.

50:11.166 --> 50:13.375
Can you locate the call?

50:14.083 --> 50:15.875
I don't know where I am.

50:15.958 --> 50:18.291
No, you have to come now! Right away.

50:18.375 --> 50:20.625
He'll come back soon. He'll kill me.

50:20.708 --> 50:23.666
No! There is no time.

50:27.833 --> 50:28.666
<i>Hello?</i>

50:28.750 --> 50:30.166
- Stella?
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

50:30.250 --> 50:31.708
Okay. I think I can get to the key.

50:47.250 --> 50:48.958
Stella, I know I screwed up.

50:49.875 --> 50:50.916
Shut up.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.625
I was just so angry.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.125
You are mad.

51:00.291 --> 51:03.375
You kidnap me
and want to cut off my finger?

51:05.333 --> 51:06.458
I don't know you.

51:15.791 --> 51:16.833
Lie down.

51:21.583 --> 51:22.583
Shit!

51:23.458 --> 51:24.458
Stella?

51:42.583 --> 51:43.666
Shit.

51:59.833 --> 52:01.208
Okay...

52:10.083 --> 52:11.541
Just do as we say.

52:12.708 --> 52:13.750
Then nothing will happen.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.708
Just stop lying.

52:56.583 --> 52:58.958
- I thought you weren't coming back.
- What?

52:59.750 --> 53:00.750
Nonsense.

53:14.625 --> 53:15.625
Everything okay?

53:16.916 --> 53:18.666
She puked with the gag in her mouth.

53:20.416 --> 53:21.576
Probably because of the food.

53:22.958 --> 53:24.333
But I realized early enough.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
She's sleeping now.

53:29.291 --> 53:30.291
Okay.

53:31.166 --> 53:33.791
Did you talk to the father?
Did he get the video?

53:38.833 --> 53:39.958
Tell me.

53:45.666 --> 53:46.750
Vic.

53:48.041 --> 53:49.041
The time has come.

53:50.916 --> 53:52.208
He has the money?

53:52.291 --> 53:53.571
All we need are the coordinates.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Shit.

53:58.333 --> 53:59.773
We need to get her to the boathouse.

54:03.250 --> 54:04.250
When will it start?

54:05.250 --> 54:06.250
Now.

54:07.500 --> 54:08.333
Now?

54:08.416 --> 54:10.791
Now. The father will pay.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.333
Okay.

54:17.791 --> 54:18.791
Great.

54:20.500 --> 54:21.500
Yes.

54:23.291 --> 54:24.291
Yes, great.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.500
I was really nervous.
I didn't expect that.

54:34.250 --> 54:36.500
But we pulled it off together. Straight.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.646
And tomorrow we'll have four million.

54:43.791 --> 54:47.031
We'll never see each other again. A pity
almost. But can you imagine four million?

54:49.333 --> 54:50.333
Not really.

55:01.916 --> 55:03.000
I'm going to go to Mexico.

55:05.083 --> 55:06.083
With the money.

55:07.666 --> 55:09.916
I know someone there. An old friend.

55:12.583 --> 55:16.208
He showed me a picture once.
He lives right on the Pacific Ocean.

55:18.166 --> 55:19.291
It's always sunny there.

55:23.125 --> 55:24.125
Sounds good.

55:30.375 --> 55:31.416
If you want to...

55:33.125 --> 55:34.125
Think about it.

55:42.291 --> 55:43.375
Let's end this.

56:21.416 --> 56:24.291
PREGNANCY RECORD

56:29.041 --> 56:32.166
SURNAME: MERTENS
FIRST NAME: STELLA

56:39.541 --> 56:40.541
It's starting.

57:09.708 --> 57:10.791
Where did you get this?

57:15.125 --> 57:16.405
Where did you get this? Tell me.

57:19.291 --> 57:20.458
I don't know.

57:24.625 --> 57:25.625
The police.

57:26.750 --> 57:29.875
You called the police.
Will the fucking police come?

57:30.708 --> 57:31.958
You called the fucking police.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.500
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

57:34.583 --> 57:35.416
No.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.958
Tell me the truth.

57:37.041 --> 57:38.791
No! How? I'm tied up.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.500
Why would he give you the cell phone?

57:48.250 --> 57:49.291
I don't know.

57:49.833 --> 57:50.875
Tell me.

57:51.791 --> 57:52.791
Tell me the truth.

57:56.500 --> 57:59.000
- Why would he give you the cell phone?
- I don't know.

58:01.166 --> 58:02.166
Tom!

58:04.833 --> 58:06.208
How do you know his name?

58:18.750 --> 58:22.541
EXIT

58:23.250 --> 58:25.166
<i>- You know each other.
- No.</i>

58:25.250 --> 58:29.083
No, he only told me his name
to calm me down.

58:29.166 --> 58:30.375
He gave you the cell.

58:30.458 --> 58:31.375
No.

58:31.458 --> 58:34.041
I didn't give it to you
and you're tied up.

58:37.375 --> 58:38.250
Please.

58:38.333 --> 58:40.041
Shut up. I need to think.

59:06.750 --> 59:07.791
What happened here?

59:15.666 --> 59:16.666
How did this get here?

59:19.208 --> 59:20.728
How did the bullet end up in the wall?

59:26.208 --> 59:27.208
Who shot here?

59:33.875 --> 59:35.708
Tell me who shot here or I'll kill you.

59:42.041 --> 59:44.708
I did. I shot.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.583
I had to go to the bathroom
and he uncuffed me.

59:48.666 --> 59:52.083
We had a fight and I managed
to take the gun away from him.

59:53.583 --> 59:55.041
So why are you still here then?

59:55.958 --> 59:59.875
Because he overpowered me
and cuffed me to the bed again.

01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:08.375
He is my ex-boyfriend.

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.291
He didn't tell you, right?

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.000
Do you know my name?

01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:42.791
No.

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:44.375
No.

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:46.416
What's my name?

01:00:46.916 --> 01:00:48.208
I don't know.

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.000
He told you.

01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:52.583
He didn't tell me your name.

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:53.833
- Yes, he did.
- No.

01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:55.166
Say my name.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.375
Say my name.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:27.833
You're out of breath.

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:30.375
I ran up the stairs.

01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:34.333
Shall we check her gag again?

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:37.791
I just did.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.083
You did?

01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:44.041
Is she okay?

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:48.041
What are you doing?

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:52.791
Checking.

01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:55.583
What?

01:01:56.833 --> 01:01:59.000
We want it to work when we need it, right?

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:07.291
Tom, explain something to me...

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:10.875
Why did you pick her?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.500
I didn't pick her. You did.

01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:17.750
But you suggested her. Why?

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.166
You know exactly why.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.208
I saw the newspaper article.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.625
You saw it as well.

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.291
What is this about?

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.500
Something is not right.

01:02:30.791 --> 01:02:31.791
What do you mean?

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:38.750
Well, she was acting weird.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.125
What did she say?

01:02:42.416 --> 01:02:43.416
Say?

01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:45.791
Why should she have said anything?

01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:49.625
You just said she was weird.

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:51.541
But I didn't say that she said something.

01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:53.833
What would she say?

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.250
Probably nothing.

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:05.416
Come here.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Tom, come here.

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:27.291
Tell me that we're honest with each other.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.166
Tell me that we're honest with each other.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:43.250
We're honest with each other.

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.041
Okay.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:03:59.583
Get the anesthetic.

01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:27.726
Are you checking the coordinates again?

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.291
Yeah.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:31.958
Let's go.

01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:33.041
Give me your keys.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.250
Why? You have your own.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:37.500
You don't need them anymore.

01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:40.041
Is that a problem?

01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:45.916
No, no problem.

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:47.708
Fine.

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:52.500
Let's go.

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.583
Where?

01:07:54.666 --> 01:07:55.666
To get the money.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:59.000
The plan was that I stay here.

01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:01.166
I need you at the handoff
in case of any surprises.

01:08:01.541 --> 01:08:02.708
What kind of surprises?

01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:06.041
Tom, if I knew,
they wouldn't be surprises.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.708
- But...
- What?

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.416
What if something happens to us
and we don't come back?

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:12.958
We will come back.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.875
But what if we won't? She'd die here.

01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:18.166
If we don't make it,
who cares what happens to her?

01:08:20.666 --> 01:08:22.026
It's better if we kill her anyway.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:25.416
Because if not, she will always
be able to identify our voices.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.000
If she's dead, she can't. Right?

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:32.416
Right.

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.291
Let's go.

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:53.750
Wait.

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:55.958
What?

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.500
My shoe.

01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:11.041
Okay.

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.038
Is the money already there?

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:50.208
It is.

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:53.041
Go get it.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:54.750
Me?

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:57.666
- What if they're waiting for us?
- They're not.

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.208
- But...
- Go.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.250
Get the money.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:52.750
Vic!

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:56.916
Vic, the money isn't here.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
They screwed us over.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.250
Shit.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.583
They didn't screw us over.

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.625
But why is the money not here then?

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.651
I sent them different coordinates.

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:21.291
Vic, wait!

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.708
What did she tell you?

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:26.333
Please...

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:28.541
I'm sorry.

01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:30.458
No, I'm sorry.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.583
Please don't do this.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:39.625
She's pregnant with my baby.

01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:43.208
What did you say about me?

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:46.333
Did you tell her my name?

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:51.500
Only your first name
and that we know each other from prison.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.916
I asked you whether we're honest
with each other.

01:12:58.625 --> 01:12:59.665
You don't have to do this.

01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:03.833
We'll go ahead as planned. We'll pick up
the money and you'll never see me again.

01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:06.916
Forget it. You screwed up.
This is the consequence.

01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:09.333
- Close your eyes.
- Wait, Vic!

01:13:09.416 --> 01:13:11.208
- Close your eyes.
- Wait!

01:13:13.083 --> 01:13:15.291
Do you remember
when we first met in prison?

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:20.500
I was so scared and you protected me.
You helped me.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.625
I'll never forget that.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:37.375
Tom!

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:37.791
Tom!

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:41.666
Tom!

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.083
Help!

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:54.625
Help!

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.166
Help!

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:16.625
Help!

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:18.875
Help me! Help!

01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:21.958
Let's end this.

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:33.666
It's almost over.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:36.833
Everything will be over.

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:42.291
The poison will stop your breathing.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:49.916
Then you'll die quickly.

01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:53.291
Stay calm.

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.125
Stay calm.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:58.416
Stay calm.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.250
Calm down!

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:07.208
It'll hurt for a brief moment
and then you won't feel anything anymore.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.620
What do you still want here?

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.541
Her death is your fault.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:34.333
And her child's death, too.

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:38.375
No!

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.166
I don't understand you, Tom.

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:49.125
I thought we'd do this together.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.375
I trusted you.

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.375
I liked you.

01:18:55.458 --> 01:18:56.958
But you ruined everything.

01:18:59.666 --> 01:19:00.666
Vic...

01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:04.750
I have something to tell you.

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:06.625
I don't care anymore.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:07.708
Yes, you do.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Screw you.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:33.875
Tom!

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Tom!

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.416
Tom!

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:45.291
Tom! The keys, Tom.

01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:48.291
Tom.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:53.833
The keys, Tom!

01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:15.708
Yes.

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:20.166
Hey!

01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:25.041
Tom!

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.500
Yes.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Tom!
