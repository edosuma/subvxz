TO TALK ABOUT THE UNDECIDEDS

06:59.066 --> 07:02.233

07:19.433 --> 07:22.266

THEMSELVES?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.266
TRUSTED, 60-70% OF PEOPLE WITH A

07:26.333 --> 07:27.033
FEW PEOPLE WHO DO TRUST TO THE

07:27.100 --> 07:30.266
PEOPLE AROUND THEM

07:30.333 --> 07:31.366

07:43.100 --> 07:43.600
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, A

07:43.666 --> 07:44.566
CONTEMPORARY RESEARCHER WANTS TO

07:44.633 --> 07:48.333
KNOW MY REVIEWS.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.166

07:49.233 --> 07:51.266
WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WOULD SAY

07:51.333 --> 07:52.100
ABOUT THAT I WOULD SAY FUCK

07:52.166 --> 07:53.666
THAT, WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

07:53.733 --> 07:55.500
>> THIS A LOT OF VOTERS JUST

07:55.566 --> 07:57.633
LIKE YOU.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.666
THE BIG PROBLEM IN PEOPLE WITH

07:58.733 --> 07:59.966
LOW SOCIAL TRUST NEVER ANSWER

08:00.033 --> 08:01.233
PHONE SURVEYS BUT IT USED TO NOT

08:01.300 --> 08:01.966
MATTER.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.600
IT USED TO BE POLITICS WAS A

08:03.666 --> 08:05.566
FIGHT ABOUT WHETHER TAXES SHOULD

08:05.633 --> 08:06.633
BE HIGHER OR LOWER.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.700
DONALD TRUMP CHANGED THAT, HE

08:07.766 --> 08:09.066
CHANGED WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A

08:09.133 --> 08:14.700
REPUBLICAN AND SUDDENLY IF YOU

08:14.766 --> 08:16.566
LOOK, AMONG PEOPLE WHO TRUST

08:16.633 --> 08:17.600
THEIR NEIGHBORS, THAT GROUP

08:17.666 --> 08:19.200
SWUNG TOWARDS CLINTON BY FIVE OR

08:19.266 --> 08:20.933
SIX POINTS, THAT'S WITH THE

08:21.033 --> 08:22.500
POLLS CAPTURED IN THE POLLING WE

08:22.566 --> 08:23.133
SAW BUT THERE WAS THIS SILENT,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.266
HIDDEN MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO

08:25.333 --> 08:26.400
DIDN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE AROUND

08:26.466 --> 08:28.466
THEM AND WEREN'T ANSWERING

08:28.533 --> 08:30.200

08:30.266 --> 08:30.833
DISPROPORTIONATELY WORKING-CLASS

08:30.900 --> 08:31.500
WHITE VOTERS WHO LIVE IN THE

08:31.566 --> 08:33.033
MIDWEST AND THAT IS THE BIG

08:33.100 --> 08:35.700
REASON WHY ALL OF THESE

08:35.766 --> 08:36.266
MIDWESTERN POLLS WERE WRONG.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.433
>> Bill: WILL HE FIX THIS NEXT

08:37.500 --> 08:38.533
TIME WHEN THEY STARTED TO

08:38.600 --> 08:41.000
POLLING, CAN THEY ADJUST THAT?

08:41.066 --> 08:42.533
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENT POLLING

08:42.600 --> 08:44.433
STORY WHICH IS IN 2016, THE

08:44.500 --> 08:46.366
STATES WERE WRONG BUT AT LEAST

08:46.433 --> 08:48.566
THE NATIONAL POLLS WERE ABOUT

08:48.633 --> 08:48.800
RIGHT.

08:48.866 --> 08:50.166
2020 WAS WAY WORSE, THE NATIONAL

08:50.233 --> 08:52.000
POLLS WERE OFF BY THREE OR FOUR

08:52.066 --> 08:52.866
POINTS AND THE REASON I THINK

08:52.933 --> 08:54.333
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, IT'S

08:54.400 --> 08:56.500
BASICALLY CORONAVIRUS.

08:56.566 --> 09:00.233
WHEN WE DO OUR SURVEYS, WE JOIN

09:00.300 --> 09:01.633
THEM INTO THE VOTER FILE, WE CAN

09:01.700 --> 09:03.400
SEE STARTING IN MARCH THE

09:03.466 --> 09:04.833
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO

09:04.900 --> 09:05.466
ANSWERED SURVEYS WERE REGISTERED

09:05.533 --> 09:07.000
DEMOCRATS SHOT UP IN THE REASON

09:07.066 --> 09:09.033
IS DEMOCRATS WERE STUCK AT HOME,

09:09.100 --> 09:10.433
THEY RESPECTED THE LOCKDOWN, YOU

09:10.500 --> 09:11.366
COULD TELL WITH CREEPY

09:11.433 --> 09:12.633
CELL PHONE DATA THE DEMOCRATS

09:12.700 --> 09:13.566
WERE STAYING HOME AND

09:13.633 --> 09:14.566
REPUBLICANS WERE OUT PARTYING

09:14.633 --> 09:18.233
AND DOING SPRING BREAK.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.200
THOSE DEMOCRATS WERE JUST

09:19.266 --> 09:19.766
DESPERATELY ANSWERING EVERY

09:19.833 --> 09:21.933
SURVEY THEY COULD FIND.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.900
THAT'S WHY THE SURVEYS WERE

09:22.966 --> 09:26.100
WRONG, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.400
[LAUGHTER]

09:27.466 --> 09:32.066
>> Bill: OKAY.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.300
WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OF

09:34.366 --> 09:37.166
THE 2020 -- TO ME, I DON'T KNOW

09:37.233 --> 09:39.366
IF THIS IS WHAT SCIENTISTS SAID

09:39.433 --> 09:40.266
BUT THE FACT THAT TRUMP DID

09:40.333 --> 09:42.333
BETTER WITH MINORITIES.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.000
>> YEAH.

09:45.066 --> 09:46.966
>> Bill: WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

09:47.033 --> 09:50.566
>> I THINK THE BIG SURPRISE, IN

09:50.633 --> 09:52.433
2016 TRUMP DID DO BETTER WITH

09:52.500 --> 09:57.633
NONWHITE VOTERS THEN

09:57.700 --> 09:59.000
BARACK OBAMA DID AND I THINK

09:59.066 --> 10:03.266
PEOPLE -- THIS A LOT OF REASONS

10:03.333 --> 10:05.233
HE WOULD DO BETTER WITH NONBITE

10:05.300 --> 10:08.000
VOTERS BUT IN 2018, NONWHITE

10:08.066 --> 10:10.066
VOTERS DEFENDED AGAINST

10:10.133 --> 10:10.866
DEMOCRATS WHILE WHITE VOTERS

10:10.933 --> 10:11.433
TRENDED TOWARD AND THIS IS

10:11.500 --> 10:12.200
CONSEQUENTIAL.

10:12.266 --> 10:13.866
WE LOST THE FLORIDA SENATE RACE,

10:13.933 --> 10:14.900
THE GEORGIA GOVERNOR'S RACE, IF

10:14.966 --> 10:16.500
STACEY ABRAMS HAD DONE AS WELL

10:16.566 --> 10:17.600
AMONG BLACK VOTERS AS

10:17.666 --> 10:18.500
HILLARY CLINTON DID, SHE WOULD

10:18.566 --> 10:21.566
BE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW.

10:21.633 --> 10:22.466
BUT 2020 WAS A CONTINUATION OF

10:22.533 --> 10:23.200
THAT TREND AND I THINK THAT WAS

10:23.266 --> 10:25.366
THE THING THAT WAS MOST

10:25.433 --> 10:26.166
SURPRISING.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.333
IF IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF

10:27.400 --> 10:29.166
PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE COMING, JUST

10:29.233 --> 10:30.900
TO RUN THROUGH IT, HISPANIC

10:30.966 --> 10:33.100
VOTERS SWUNG SOMETHING LIKE NINE

10:33.166 --> 10:33.633
PERCENTAGE POINTS AGAINST

10:33.700 --> 10:35.300
DEMOCRATS AND THAT IS PERCENTAGE

10:35.366 --> 10:38.200
POINTS, THAT MEANS ROUGHLY

10:38.266 --> 10:39.200
ONE IN TEN HISPANIC VOTERS

10:39.266 --> 10:40.166
SWITCH THEIR VOTE.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.366
>> Bill: THAT'S A GROUP THAT

10:41.433 --> 10:42.066
DEMOCRATS COUNT ON.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.800
>> HISTORICALLY YES AND WITH

10:43.866 --> 10:44.700
BLACK VOTERS IT WASN'T AS LARGE

10:44.766 --> 10:48.433
BUT STILL THERE WAS OF 2-3%

10:48.500 --> 10:50.933
SHIFT, AMONG ASIAN VOTERS, A

10:51.000 --> 10:55.266
FIVE OR 6% SHIFT.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.000
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

10:56.066 --> 10:57.333
>> Bill: I'VE READ YOU'VE SAID

10:57.400 --> 10:58.766
MOST VOTERS ARE NOT LIBERAL.

10:58.833 --> 11:03.033
>> YEAH -- DOMINIC --

11:03.100 --> 11:04.366
>> Bill: EVEN MOST DEMOCRATS.

11:04.433 --> 11:05.433
>> AMONG DEMOCRATS IT'S ROUGHLY

11:05.500 --> 11:09.866
50/50 BUT I THINK AMONG WHITE

11:09.933 --> 11:12.066
PEOPLE, ABOUT 90% OF WHITE

11:12.133 --> 11:14.233
LIBERALS VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND

11:14.300 --> 11:15.000
80% OF WHITE CONSERVATIVES VOTE

11:15.066 --> 11:15.533
FOR REPUBLICANS BUT WITH

11:15.600 --> 11:17.500
NONWHITE VOTERS IT'S NOT LIKE

11:17.566 --> 11:22.366
THAT AND THIS IS JUST

11:22.433 --> 11:23.200
ARITHMETICALLY, IDEOLOGY DOESN'T

11:23.266 --> 11:25.533
VARY MUCH BY RACE, ROUGHLY THE

11:25.600 --> 11:28.666
SAME NUMBER BLACK, WHITE,

11:28.733 --> 11:30.366
HISPANIC VOTERS IDENTIFY AS

11:30.433 --> 11:31.766
LIBERAL, MODERATE AND

11:31.833 --> 11:32.366
CONSERVATIVE BUT PARTISANSHIP

11:32.433 --> 11:34.166
VARIES A LOT AND THE REASON FOR

11:34.233 --> 11:35.633
WHY IS DEMOCRATS HISTORICALLY

11:35.700 --> 11:38.400
HAVE DONE REALLY WELL WITH

11:38.466 --> 11:39.166
NONWHITE CONSERVATIVES.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.700
THE STORY OF 2020 IS THAT

11:41.766 --> 11:43.400
DEMOCRATS USED TO WIN HISPANIC

11:43.466 --> 11:45.066
CONSERVATIVES BY DOUBLE DIGITS

11:45.133 --> 11:47.566
AND THIS TIME TRUMP WON THEM BY

11:47.633 --> 11:48.033
DOUBLE DIGITS.

11:48.100 --> 11:48.600
>> Bill: WOULD YOU SAY THERE

11:48.666 --> 11:52.300
IS A WOKE AND LIBERAL ARE NOW

11:52.366 --> 11:56.466
TWO DIFFERENT WINGS OF THE

11:56.533 --> 11:57.033
PARTY?

11:57.100 --> 11:57.700
PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES

11:57.766 --> 12:01.100
CLASSIC LIBERALS LIKE I DO --

12:01.166 --> 12:03.933
THAT'S WHY I THINK THEY LOSE,

12:04.000 --> 12:04.566
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN LOSING

12:04.633 --> 12:06.500
VOTES THAT THEY SHOULD BE

12:06.566 --> 12:09.666
WINNING.

12:09.733 --> 12:10.900
"DEFUND THE POLICE" COULD YOU

12:10.966 --> 12:12.300
COME UP WITH A MORE DRIVE AWAY

12:12.366 --> 12:16.500
THE VOTERS PHRASE THEM THAT FOR

12:16.566 --> 12:17.366
EXAMPLE?

12:17.433 --> 12:18.200
JUST TO TAKE ONE.

12:18.266 --> 12:20.400
>> CRIME IS REALLY UNPOPULAR.

12:20.466 --> 12:22.966
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE

12:23.033 --> 12:23.366
POLITICAL ADVICE.

12:23.433 --> 12:26.100
I THINK THE CORE PROBLEM HERE IS

12:26.166 --> 12:30.033
AS THE PARTY HAS BECOME MORE

12:30.100 --> 12:31.600
EDUCATED AND EDUCATED PEOPLE ARE

12:31.666 --> 12:34.266
INCREASINGLY DEFINED THE BAND OF

12:34.333 --> 12:35.033
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ONE

12:35.100 --> 12:36.466
THING I LIKE TO SAY IS A LOT OF

12:36.533 --> 12:39.200
PEOPLE WILL SAY IT'S A TRUISM IN

12:39.266 --> 12:40.866
POLITICS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE TOO

12:40.933 --> 12:42.900
WONKY, WE ARE EGGHEADS, WE TALK

12:42.966 --> 12:43.433
ABOUT ISSUES AND NEED TO

12:43.500 --> 12:48.833
COMMUNICATE OUR VALUES BUT THE

12:48.900 --> 12:50.666
MEDIAN VOTER DOESN'T SHARE OUR

12:50.733 --> 12:51.966
VALUES, IF THEY HAD OUR VALUES

12:52.033 --> 12:53.000
THEY WOULD BE LIBERALS BUT ARE

12:53.066 --> 12:54.833
THE ONLY WAY DEMOCRATS HAVE

12:54.900 --> 12:55.833
HISTORICALLY WON ELECTIONS IS

12:55.900 --> 12:57.133
TALKING ABOUT CONCRETE ISSUES

12:57.200 --> 12:58.966
THAT PEOPLE AGREED WITH US ON.

12:59.033 --> 13:00.033
IT'S HOW BILL CLINTON WON, IT'S

13:00.100 --> 13:03.233
HOW BARACK OBAMA WON AND THAT

13:03.300 --> 13:03.700
WAS ONE OF JOE BIDEN'S

13:03.766 --> 13:03.966
STRENGTHS.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.000
>> Bill: WHAT ARE THESE VALUES

13:05.066 --> 13:07.066
THAT YOU THINK THE AVERAGE VOTER

13:07.133 --> 13:07.400
DOESN'T SHARE?

13:07.466 --> 13:09.233
>> TO GO BACK TO THE POLLING

13:09.300 --> 13:11.266
THING, SOCIAL TRUST IS A BIG

13:11.333 --> 13:11.600
ONE.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.566
LIBERALS TRUST GOVERNMENT, THEY

13:13.633 --> 13:14.900
TRUST SOCIETY, THEY REALLY

13:14.966 --> 13:18.300
BELIEVE IN POSITIVE CHANGE AND

13:18.366 --> 13:22.366
THE POTENTIAL FOR POSITIVE

13:22.433 --> 13:23.266
INTERACTION.

13:23.333 --> 13:23.766
ALSO RACIAL RESENTMENT,

13:23.833 --> 13:24.566
ATTITUDES TOWARDS GENDER, WHAT

13:24.633 --> 13:25.533
KIND OF SOCIETY PEOPLE WANT TO

13:25.600 --> 13:27.233
LIVE IN, WHAT KIND OF

13:27.300 --> 13:28.833
NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE WANT TO

13:28.900 --> 13:31.233
LIVE IN, LIBERAL LIKE TO LIVE AN

13:31.300 --> 13:33.000
EXCITING, TIGHTLY PACKED CITIES,

13:33.066 --> 13:33.600
FROM A PERSONALITY PERSPECTIVE

13:33.666 --> 13:36.600
SCIENTISTS LIKE TO STUDY THE

13:36.666 --> 13:37.533
PERSONALITY MODEL, OPENNESS TO

13:37.600 --> 13:39.966
NEW EXPERIENCES, USEFUL WORD TO

13:40.033 --> 13:42.566
KNOW AND JUST THE IDEA OF HOW

13:42.633 --> 13:43.800
PEOPLE RESPOND TO NOVEL STIMULI.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.800
IT'S HIGHLY CORRELATED TO

13:44.866 --> 13:45.533
LIBERALISM.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.000
AT SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE

13:47.066 --> 13:48.833
SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING, NEW

13:48.900 --> 13:49.366
ETHNIC RESTAURANT THEY GET

13:49.433 --> 13:51.233
REALLY EXCITED AND ENERGIZED.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.300
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE, THE

13:53.366 --> 13:55.433
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SEE NOVEL

13:55.500 --> 13:57.100
STIMULI AND IT DRAINS THEM, IT

13:57.166 --> 13:59.566
FREAKS THEM OUT AND THAT'S WHY

13:59.633 --> 14:00.433
THERE'S ALL THIS GEOGRAPHIC

14:00.500 --> 14:01.000
SORTING.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.633
>> Bill: WE SEEM TO BE

14:02.700 --> 14:03.266
ENTERING AN ERA OF RESEGREGATION

14:03.333 --> 14:05.666
THAT'S COMING FROM THE LEFT.

14:05.733 --> 14:09.666
ON MANY COLLEGE CAMPUSES, THERE

14:09.733 --> 14:11.566
ARE SEPARATE DORMS, SEPARATE

14:11.633 --> 14:13.766
BLACK DORMS, GRADUATION

14:13.833 --> 14:14.700
CEREMONIES, STUFF LIKE THAT.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.333
HOW WILL THAT AFFECT ELECTIONS

14:15.400 --> 14:19.233
IN THE FUTURE?

14:19.300 --> 14:22.166
>> THERE'S A GREAT STUDY IN

14:22.233 --> 14:22.700
NORTH CAROLINA THAT SHOWED

14:22.766 --> 14:23.433
RACIALLY INTEGRATED SCHOOLS MAKE

14:23.500 --> 14:25.866
PEOPLE MORE LIBERAL BUT I THINK

14:25.933 --> 14:30.766
JUST TO GO BACK, I THINK THE

14:30.833 --> 14:33.833
IMPORTANT THING IS TO REALIZE

14:33.900 --> 14:34.866
THAT MOST NONWHITE VOTERS ARE

14:34.933 --> 14:36.666
NOT LIBERAL, THEY DON'T IDENTIFY

14:36.733 --> 14:38.833
AS LIBERAL, WE SHOULD TAKE IT

14:38.900 --> 14:41.366
SERIOUSLY.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.266
I THINK REALIZING THAT MOST

14:43.333 --> 14:44.966
VOTERS DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES

14:45.033 --> 14:46.300
MEANS THAT WE SHOULD INSTEAD

14:46.366 --> 14:47.533
MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WITH

14:47.600 --> 14:48.966
THE VALUES THAT THEY HOLD AND WE

14:49.033 --> 14:49.833
SHOULD TALK TO THEM ABOUT ISSUES

14:49.900 --> 14:52.900
THEY CARE ABOUT.

14:52.966 --> 14:53.166
[APPLAUSE]

14:53.233 --> 14:54.600
>> Bill: THANKS FOR COMING ON,

14:54.666 --> 14:55.533
VERY ENLIGHTENING.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.733
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN

14:58.800 --> 14:59.266
YOU'RE 40.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.533
THANKS, DAVID, LET'S MEET OUR

15:01.600 --> 15:06.700
PANEL!

15:06.766 --> 15:06.900
OKAY!

15:06.966 --> 15:07.966
HERE THEY ARE.

15:08.033 --> 15:08.733
HE'S EDITOR-AT-LARGE AT REASON

15:08.800 --> 15:09.500
AND HOST OF "THE REASON

15:09.566 --> 15:10.700
INTERVIEW" PODCAST: NICK

15:10.766 --> 15:14.866
GILLESPIE.

15:14.933 --> 15:16.600
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.566
SHE'S THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC

15:17.633 --> 15:19.333
SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA AND

15:19.400 --> 15:23.366
CO-FOUNDER OF THE ONE COUNTRY

15:23.433 --> 15:27.733
PROJECT:

15:27.800 --> 15:29.233
OUR RETURNING CHAMPION, HEIDI

15:29.300 --> 15:29.566
HEITKAMP.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.833
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.066
LET'S GET TO THE TRAGEDY OF THE

15:34.133 --> 15:34.700
WEEK, JOE BIDEN JUST BEFORE HE

15:34.766 --> 15:37.100
WENT ON WAS SPEAKING IN ATLANTA,

15:37.166 --> 15:40.866
HE SAID WHATEVER MOTIVATION, WE

15:40.933 --> 15:42.000
KNOW THIS TOO MANY

15:42.066 --> 15:42.533
ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN

15:42.600 --> 15:43.266
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS

15:43.333 --> 15:44.933
AND WORRYING WAKING UP EACH

15:45.000 --> 15:45.666
MORNING AND FEELING THEIR SAFETY

15:45.733 --> 15:47.100
AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR LOVED

15:47.166 --> 15:47.766
ONES ARE AT STAKE, I THOUGHT

15:47.833 --> 15:52.600
THAT WAS A GREAT STATEMENT.

15:52.666 --> 15:55.333
TRUE STATEMENT, LET'S NOT BURY

15:55.400 --> 15:56.066
THE LEDE.

15:56.133 --> 15:59.266
THIS IS A BIG VIOLENT CRIME,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.133
AGAINST ASIANS OF 150%.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.966
THIS IS INTOLERABLE, WE HAVE TO

16:03.033 --> 16:04.500
ADDRESS IT, HOWEVER THIS STORY

16:04.566 --> 16:05.833
IS INSTRUCTIVE AND I THINK IT

16:05.900 --> 16:08.733
SAYS A LOT ABOUT OUR TRIBALISM

16:08.800 --> 16:10.533
AND INABILITY TO SEE EVIDENCE AS

16:10.600 --> 16:12.200
OPPOSED TO WHAT WOULD FIT THE

16:12.266 --> 16:13.866
NARRATIVE THAT WE ALREADY

16:13.933 --> 16:14.166
BELIEVE.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.333
CHRISTOPHER WRAY SAYS "IT DOES

16:16.400 --> 16:17.000
NOT APPEAR" -- THAT'S THE HEAD

16:17.066 --> 16:20.666
OF THE FBI "IT DOES NOT APPEAR

16:20.733 --> 16:22.166
THE MOTIVE WAS RACIALLY

16:22.233 --> 16:23.266
MOTIVATED."

16:23.333 --> 16:24.766
YET MARILYN STRICKLAND, SHE IS

16:24.833 --> 16:28.100
FROM WASHINGTON STATE "RACIALLY

16:28.166 --> 16:29.133
MOTIVATED VIOLENCE SHOULD BE

16:29.200 --> 16:31.200
CALLED EXACTLY FOR WHAT IT IS,

16:31.266 --> 16:33.333
WE MUST STOP MAKING EXCUSES OR

16:33.400 --> 16:34.566
REBRANDING IT AS ECONOMIC

16:34.633 --> 16:38.366
ANXIETY OR SEXUAL ADDICTION."

16:38.433 --> 16:40.266
BUT WHAT IF IT IS THAT?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.366
EVERYTHING I'VE READ ABOUT THIS

16:42.433 --> 16:47.433
GUY, CONSERVATIVE BAPTIST, HE IS

16:47.500 --> 16:48.833
AN ALBINO ASSASSIN, HE'S

16:48.900 --> 16:50.566
FLAGELLATING HIMSELF BECAUSE HE

16:50.633 --> 16:54.400
FEELS BAD ABOUT SEX.

16:54.466 --> 16:55.466
PORN ADDICTION, SEEKS TREATMENT

16:55.533 --> 16:59.033
FOR SEXUAL ADDICTION, THE

16:59.100 --> 17:00.633
ROOMMATE SAID WHENEVER WE TALK

17:00.700 --> 17:02.200
ABOUT VISITING A MASSAGE PARLORS

17:02.266 --> 17:04.166
IT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF GOD AND

17:04.233 --> 17:05.200
HIS PARENTS, WOULDN'T THE

17:05.266 --> 17:07.233
ROOMMATE TO KNOW IF IT WAS ABOUT

17:07.300 --> 17:08.600
RACE?

17:08.666 --> 17:09.200
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT SOMETHING

17:09.266 --> 17:10.333
THAT'S NOT THERE BUT IT SEEMS

17:10.400 --> 17:13.233
LIKE PEOPLE INSIST -- THIS IS

17:13.300 --> 17:13.933
WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS I'M JUST

17:14.000 --> 17:17.366
GOING TO INSIST.

17:17.433 --> 17:18.500
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO LOOK

17:18.566 --> 17:21.000
AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF OUR

17:21.066 --> 17:22.566
BIAS BUT MY CRITICISM THERE IS

17:22.633 --> 17:23.166
HOW DOES CHRISTOPHER WRAY KNOW

17:23.233 --> 17:25.933
IT WASN'T ABOUT RACE?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.433
HE CRITICIZES JUMPING THE GUN

17:29.500 --> 17:30.933
BUT HE HASN'T FINISHED HIS

17:31.000 --> 17:31.266
INVESTIGATION.

17:31.333 --> 17:31.800
WE DON'T KNOW, HE SAID IT

17:31.866 --> 17:33.766
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE, WILL SHUT

17:33.833 --> 17:35.733
YOUR MOUTH AND SAY I DON'T KNOW

17:35.800 --> 17:37.133
YET, CAN YOU JUST GIVE US SOME

17:37.200 --> 17:40.133
TIME TO FINISH THE INVESTIGATIO

17:40.200 --> 17:40.466
INVESTIGATION?

17:40.533 --> 17:42.700
[APPLAUSE]

17:42.766 --> 17:44.066
>> I THINK THAT IS BASICALLY

17:44.133 --> 17:47.033
WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND I THINK

17:47.100 --> 17:49.466
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE IN

17:49.533 --> 17:50.633
A SUPERCHARGED ENVIRONMENT WHERE

17:50.700 --> 17:51.200
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT

17:51.266 --> 17:55.000
RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY, THE

17:55.066 --> 17:58.500
SAME SURVEY THAT SHOWED 150%

17:58.566 --> 17:59.100
INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES IN 16

17:59.166 --> 18:01.800
MAJOR CITIES, OVERALL

18:01.866 --> 18:04.433
HATE CRIMES LAST YEAR WENT DOWN

18:04.500 --> 18:05.433
BY 7%.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.933
WE SHOULDN'T BE RUSHING TO TRY

18:07.000 --> 18:08.766
TO FIT EVERYTHING INTO A

18:08.833 --> 18:10.733
HATE CRIME.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.966
THE HISTORY OF ASIANS IN

18:12.033 --> 18:14.400
AMERICA, THEY WERE THE FIRST

18:14.466 --> 18:15.400
PEOPLE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM

18:15.466 --> 18:17.966
IMMIGRATION -- AS A MATTER OF

18:18.033 --> 18:20.733
FACT, SALVATION, INDIANS, THERE

18:20.800 --> 18:22.333
WAS A 1943 SUPREME COURT CASE

18:22.400 --> 18:23.266
WHERE AN INDIAN TRIED TO SAY WHY

18:23.333 --> 18:25.166
HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED CITIZENSHIP

18:25.233 --> 18:27.266
AND NOT ONLY DID HE LOSE, THEY

18:27.333 --> 18:28.233
ENDED UP KICKING OUT OTHER

18:28.300 --> 18:30.500
INDIANS WHO HAD MANAGED TO GET

18:30.566 --> 18:31.466
HERE.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.400
THEY HAVE A HORRIBLE HISTORY IN

18:32.466 --> 18:35.266
THIS COUNTRY BUT IT'S ALSO A

18:35.333 --> 18:37.100
GREAT IMMIGRANT STORY IN THAT

18:37.166 --> 18:37.733
ASIAN-AMERICANS NOW MAKE FAR

18:37.800 --> 18:41.333
MORE THAN THE MEDIAN AVERAGE

18:41.400 --> 18:43.466
FAMILY HOUSEHOLD IN TERMS OF

18:43.533 --> 18:45.933
INCOME AND EDUCATION AND

18:46.000 --> 18:47.566
OPPORTUNITY.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.933
AS WE TALK AND TRY TO FIX RACISM

18:51.000 --> 18:55.166
IN OUR SOCIETY, THE ASIANS ARE

18:55.233 --> 18:59.366
LIKE JEWS IN AMERICA, THEY FACE

18:59.433 --> 19:00.666
A LOT OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS BUT

19:00.733 --> 19:03.200
THEY SUCCEED VERY WELL AND THEY

19:03.266 --> 19:03.766
ULTIMATELY ARE ACCEPTED TO.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.466
>> THE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY

19:05.533 --> 19:08.600
IS WE DON'T CONFRONT ISSUES LIKE

19:08.666 --> 19:09.933
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH

19:10.000 --> 19:12.433
THE ASIANS UNTIL WE HAVE A MASS

19:12.500 --> 19:14.600
SHOOTING AT A MASSAGE PARLOR,

19:14.666 --> 19:17.000
BUT WHY NOT?

19:17.066 --> 19:20.200
>> YOUR INSISTING IT IS RACIAL.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.466
>> Bill: I REALLY FEEL LIKE IF

19:21.533 --> 19:25.200
IT WAS ARMENIANS WHO WERE

19:25.266 --> 19:26.366
MANNING THE MASSAGE PARLORS, HE

19:26.433 --> 19:28.733
WOULD HAVE KILLED ARMENIANS.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.166
>> WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

19:30.233 --> 19:30.700
>> Bill: WE DON'T KNOW BUT

19:30.766 --> 19:34.366
WHAT WE DO KNOW, THE ROOMMATE,

19:34.433 --> 19:35.366
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING IN THE

19:35.433 --> 19:38.966
PRIVACY OF HIS HOME.

19:39.033 --> 19:41.400
WOULDN'T HE HAVE SET IT THERE?

19:41.466 --> 19:44.366
>> I DO THINK IT'S RIGHT TO SAY

19:44.433 --> 19:46.266
OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THIS IS

19:46.333 --> 19:47.800
SOMETHING THAT TRUMP AND A

19:47.866 --> 19:49.700
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE PUSHING

19:49.766 --> 19:50.900
THE WUHAN FLU TYPE OF THING,

19:50.966 --> 19:55.233
THIS IS ODIOUS, AWFUL, RACIAL,

19:55.300 --> 19:56.933
RACIST LANGUAGE THAT SHOULD BE

19:57.000 --> 19:57.966
CONFRONTED AND THAT'S SOMETHING

19:58.033 --> 19:59.366
THAT BIDEN SAID IF YOU HEAR

19:59.433 --> 20:00.500
SOMETHING, DON'T PUT UP WITH AND

20:00.566 --> 20:03.433
PUT IT DOWN, THAT'S TRUE.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.033
I THINK TURNING THIS PARTICULAR

20:05.100 --> 20:06.833
INSTANCE INTO SOMETHING WHICH IT

20:06.900 --> 20:08.800
MAY NOT, THAT DOES NOT HELP YOU

20:08.866 --> 20:11.266
REACH PEOPLE WHO ARE RACIST.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.133
IT CONFIRMS THEIR IDEA.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.366
>> MY POINT IS IN TILL THERE IS

20:14.433 --> 20:15.366
SOMETHING SO HEINOUS, WE DON'T

20:15.433 --> 20:18.633
CONFRONT REAL PROBLEMS.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.500
>> Bill: SEXUAL GUILT FROM

20:20.566 --> 20:26.900
RELIGION IS ALSO A BIG THING.

20:26.966 --> 20:28.200
IT'S BEEN A BIG THING FOR

20:28.266 --> 20:28.466
MILLENNIA.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.600
[APPLAUSE]

20:30.666 --> 20:32.166
EXACTLY.

20:32.233 --> 20:35.333
JESUS DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE WE

20:35.400 --> 20:37.666
ARE SEXUAL BEINGS AND RELIGION

20:37.733 --> 20:40.933
MAKES YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.266
>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT

20:43.333 --> 20:44.333
MASSAGE PARLORS, WHAT ABOUT

20:44.400 --> 20:46.266
LEGALIZING SEX WORK, THERE ARE

20:46.333 --> 20:48.166
WAYS THAT WE CAN CHANGE HOW

20:48.233 --> 20:50.966
PEOPLE INTERACT AND HOW THEY

20:51.033 --> 20:53.200
MEET BASIC NEEDS IN AN OPEN WAY

20:53.266 --> 20:54.166
AND A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.333
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE CAN BE

20:56.400 --> 20:57.733
TALKING ABOUT COMING OUT OF THIS

20:57.800 --> 20:58.333
AND I DO THINK IT'S RIGHT TO

20:58.400 --> 21:03.100
TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THE

21:03.166 --> 21:04.266
RESIDUE OF ANTI-ASIAN RACISM IN

21:04.333 --> 21:05.633
AMERICA AND DEAL WITH THAT, BUT

21:05.700 --> 21:07.566
NOT NECESSARILY TO TURN THIS

21:07.633 --> 21:08.100
INTO SOMETHING IT'S NOT.

21:08.166 --> 21:14.400
>> Bill: IS IT THAT HARD TO

21:14.466 --> 21:15.333
KEEP TWO THOUGHTS IN HER MIND AT

21:15.400 --> 21:17.233
THE SAME TIME, THIS EPIDEMIC OF

21:17.300 --> 21:17.766
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIANS IS

21:17.833 --> 21:18.533
HORRIBLE AND WE NEED TO DO

21:18.600 --> 21:21.233
SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THIS

21:21.300 --> 21:21.766
PROBABLY ISN'T PART OF IT.

21:21.833 --> 21:22.866
>> PEOPLE GET SO FRUSTRATED THAT

21:22.933 --> 21:24.400
THAT NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION

21:24.466 --> 21:25.566
THAT EVERYBODY JUMPS ON

21:25.633 --> 21:26.966
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND SAYS

21:27.033 --> 21:28.533
THERE IT IS AND THEN YOU GET THE

21:28.600 --> 21:29.933
ATTENTION AND THAT IS THE

21:30.000 --> 21:30.766
PROBLEM.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.066
WE DON'T GIVE ATTENTION TO

21:32.133 --> 21:36.400
PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T CATASTROPHE

21:36.466 --> 21:36.766
CATASTROPHE.

21:36.833 --> 21:38.200
>> Bill: THAT'S A GOOD SEGUE

21:38.266 --> 21:41.233
TO MY ISSUE ABOUT THE BORDER.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.333
"CRISIS AT THE BORDER" HEADLINE

21:44.400 --> 21:46.333
ON THE NEWS SEASON, EVERY YEAR.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
IF I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

21:48.466 --> 21:50.633
BECAUSE I ALSO READ TODAY ALONG

21:50.700 --> 21:51.800
WITH THE BORDER STORIES THAT

21:51.866 --> 21:53.300
OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY

21:53.366 --> 21:54.200
PUT PEOPLE ON LEAVE AND FIRE TO

21:54.266 --> 21:57.733
SOME WERE SMOKING POT.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.433
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE NEW

21:59.500 --> 22:00.400
WHITE HOUSE.

22:00.466 --> 22:08.466
I THOUGHT, KAMALA HARRIS HAD A

22:08.533 --> 22:09.933
COME-TO-JESUS MOMENT ON POT TO.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.266
>> AS LONG AS SHE WAS HIGH AND

22:11.333 --> 22:14.266
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO BEING A

22:14.333 --> 22:14.433
COP.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.466
>> Bill: NOT COOL, I'M

22:16.533 --> 22:17.100
CONNECTING THESE TWO ISSUES AND

22:17.166 --> 22:20.766
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

22:20.833 --> 22:23.566
THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING FORTH

22:23.633 --> 22:25.100
LEGISLATION IN PIECES BECAUSE

22:25.166 --> 22:26.933
IMMIGRATION IS THE ISSUE THAT

22:27.000 --> 22:27.666
KEEPS HAUNTING THEM AND WE AS A

22:27.733 --> 22:32.166
COUNTRY HAVE TO SOLVE.

22:32.233 --> 22:33.666
DREAMERS, STUFF ABOUT THAT,

22:33.733 --> 22:34.766
HUMANITARIAN AID, FARMWORKERS,

22:34.833 --> 22:38.400
THESE THESE ARE THE EASY ONES.

22:38.466 --> 22:39.866
BIDEN ALSO SAID WE SHOULD

22:39.933 --> 22:42.633
ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE AND HE

22:42.700 --> 22:44.766
MENTIONED AID THE

22:44.833 --> 22:46.166
CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMIES.

22:46.233 --> 22:48.566
EXCUSE ME, THE ROOT CAUSE IS

22:48.633 --> 22:50.900
DRUGS.

22:50.966 --> 22:51.833
DRUGS.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.600
WE LIKE DRUGS, THEY GROW DRUGS,

22:54.666 --> 22:55.300
IT'S ILLEGAL, THOSE COUNTRIES

22:55.366 --> 22:59.133
ARE GOING TO BE RUN BY NARCO

22:59.200 --> 23:00.933
TERRORISTS.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.300
>> CAN I GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER

23:02.366 --> 23:04.333
AND SAY THE PROBLEM ISN'T DRUGS,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.900
THE PROBLEM IS THE WAR ON DRUGS.

23:06.966 --> 23:09.566
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

23:09.633 --> 23:10.333
TRUST ME, I DON'T THINK THE

23:10.400 --> 23:16.666
PROBLEM IS DRUGS.

23:16.733 --> 23:17.266
>> THE CARTELS AREN'T MOVING

23:17.333 --> 23:17.866
AVOCADOS, THEY ARE MOVING WEED

23:17.933 --> 23:21.866
AND COCAINE AND OTHER SUBSTANCE

23:21.933 --> 23:22.200
SUBSTANCES.

23:22.266 --> 23:22.700
THIS IS WHERE JOE BIDEN

23:22.766 --> 23:23.733
UNFORTUNATELY IS THE MOST

23:23.800 --> 23:24.900
CLUELESS PERSON, HE'S THE WORST

23:24.966 --> 23:27.233
PERSON TO HAVE IN THE

23:27.300 --> 23:27.800
WHITE HOUSE.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.366
THIS IS A GUY OVER THE PAST 50

23:30.433 --> 23:33.800
YEARS HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN EVERY

23:33.866 --> 23:35.933
MAJOR INCREASE IN THE WAR ON

23:36.000 --> 23:36.700
DRUGS.

23:36.766 --> 23:38.266
IF DRUGS IS THE ISSUE, THIS IS

23:38.333 --> 23:38.966
NOT THE GUY YOU WANT IN THE

23:39.033 --> 23:41.466
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW AS IT

23:41.533 --> 23:43.866
INTERSECTS WITH IMMIGRATION.

23:43.933 --> 23:46.166
>> THE PROBLEM IS WE CAN ALL SAY

23:46.233 --> 23:48.200
LET'S LEGALIZE IT BUT IT LEADS

23:48.266 --> 23:49.900
TO SOME PRETTY SERIOUS

23:49.966 --> 23:50.233
CONSEQUENCES.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.866
>> LIKE WHAT?

23:51.933 --> 23:53.733
>> ADDICTION, EXPANSION OF

23:53.800 --> 23:54.433
ADDICTION.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.066
I'M NOT SAYING ABOUT MARIJUANA

23:55.133 --> 23:57.300
COME ON TALKING ABOUT --

23:57.366 --> 23:59.433
>> Bill: NO.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.633
PORTUGAL DID IT, PORTUGAL DID

24:01.700 --> 24:04.533
THAT, THEY LEGALIZED EVERYTHING.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.733
>> DECRIMINALIZED AND SAW A

24:05.800 --> 24:09.166
LOWER USE RATES, LOWER ADDICTION

24:09.233 --> 24:10.800
RATES.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.666
>> LET'S TAKE A DIFFERENT RUN ON

24:12.733 --> 24:14.066
THIS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF

24:14.133 --> 24:15.233
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY DON'T

24:15.300 --> 24:15.966
WANT TO LEGALIZE DRUGS BUT THEY

24:16.033 --> 24:18.933
ALSO DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH

24:19.000 --> 24:19.566
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT LEGALIZING.

24:19.633 --> 24:20.666
>> THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

24:20.733 --> 24:26.100
WANT TO LEGALIZE WEED.

24:26.166 --> 24:26.566
>> THAT'S WHERE BIDEN

24:26.633 --> 24:29.366
ADMINISTRATION IS WAY BEHIND.

24:29.433 --> 24:33.400
>> IN NOVEMBER, PEOPLE IN OREGON

24:33.466 --> 24:34.866
DECRIMINALIZED ALL DRUGS FOR

24:34.933 --> 24:36.133
PERSONAL POSSESSION.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.000
PEOPLE IN D.C. LEGALIZED

24:37.066 --> 24:40.166
MUSHROOMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.200
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK PEOPLE ARE

24:41.266 --> 24:42.800
SAYING WE CAN HAVE THE WAR ON

24:42.866 --> 24:44.400
DRUGS OR WE CAN HAVE DRUGS IT'S

24:44.466 --> 24:44.966
NOT A TOUGH CHOICE.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.766
>> Bill: ALL THE BAD, ILLEGAL

24:47.833 --> 24:50.700
DRUGS, THEY HAVE PHARMACEUTICAL

24:50.766 --> 24:50.966
VERSIONS.

24:51.033 --> 24:51.600
YOU CAN GET COCAINE, THEY JUST

24:51.666 --> 24:55.166
CALL IT ADDERALL.

24:55.233 --> 24:57.500
YOU CAN GET HEROIN, THEY JUST

24:57.566 --> 24:59.266
CALL IT METHADONE OR OPIOIDS.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.966
>> THIS IS THE CRAZIEST STORY

25:01.033 --> 25:03.400
ABOUT POT BECAUSE IT'S SCHEDULED

25:03.466 --> 25:05.400
HIGHER THAN THOSE DRUGS BECAUSE

25:05.466 --> 25:06.533
I HAVE A PHARMACEUTICAL REASON.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.400
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE BIDEN

25:07.466 --> 25:09.166
ADMINISTRATION WOULD STEP INTO

25:09.233 --> 25:13.533
THIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THE

25:13.600 --> 25:16.166
TREND NATIONALLY WHICH IS A

25:16.233 --> 25:16.633
SOUTH DAKOTA LEGALIZE

25:16.700 --> 25:17.400
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA,

25:17.466 --> 25:21.166
SOUTH DAKOTA, RIGHT?

25:21.233 --> 25:21.966
SOUTH DAKOTA --

25:22.033 --> 25:22.666
>> Bill: YOUR STATE?

25:22.733 --> 25:24.000
>> MY STATE HAS NOT YET BUT

25:24.066 --> 25:29.133
EVERYONE WILL EVENTUALLY.

25:29.200 --> 25:29.766
>> Bill: THE NEXT TIME YOU

25:29.833 --> 25:32.466
COME ON THIS SHOW, THERE WON'T

25:32.533 --> 25:36.533
BE ALL THIS --

25:36.600 --> 25:36.800
[LAUGHTER]

25:36.866 --> 25:38.866
[APPLAUSE]

25:38.933 --> 25:40.700
ALL THIS ARGUING!

25:40.766 --> 25:42.566
>> THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE

25:42.633 --> 25:43.666
WITH THE BORDER IS THAT NO ONE

25:43.733 --> 25:46.133
WANTS TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT

25:46.200 --> 25:48.266
WHAT'S GOING ON, WHICH IS THE

25:48.333 --> 25:49.966
CARTELS ARE DOING VERY, VERY

25:50.033 --> 25:51.266
DANGEROUS, HORRIBLE THINGS,

25:51.333 --> 25:54.233
THESE KIDS ARE COMING TO THE

25:54.300 --> 25:55.233
BORDER.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.166
>> Bill: BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL

25:56.233 --> 25:56.366
DRUGS.

25:56.433 --> 25:58.466
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE ECONOMIC

25:58.533 --> 26:00.100
MIGRANTS AND THEIR GOING TO COME

26:00.166 --> 26:01.233
INTO THIS COUNTRY AND TO WORK

26:01.300 --> 26:03.033
AND TO SEND REMITTANCES HOME

26:03.100 --> 26:03.633
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS CANNOT

26:03.700 --> 26:06.100
AFFORD TO LIVE --

26:06.166 --> 26:10.166
>> THEY WILL BE LIKE MY

26:10.233 --> 26:11.666
GRANDPARENTS FROM ITALY EXCEPT

26:11.733 --> 26:12.366
BETTER WORKERS.

26:12.433 --> 26:13.766
>> IF YOU RETURN THESE KIDS,

26:13.833 --> 26:14.666
THEY WON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

26:14.733 --> 26:18.000
PAY AND THEIR FAMILIES -- THIS

26:18.066 --> 26:20.066
STUFF WITH THE KIDS IS REALLY

26:20.133 --> 26:20.433
BAD.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.533
>> Bill: THE PRESIDENT IS

26:22.600 --> 26:23.433
FINDING OUT THAT KIDS IN CAGES

26:23.500 --> 26:24.700
WAS HORRIBLE BUT WHEN KIDS SHOW

26:24.766 --> 26:26.533
UP AT THE BORDER, YOU PUT THEM

26:26.600 --> 26:27.766
IN SOME SORT OF THING THAT

26:27.833 --> 26:30.133
SOMEONE CAN CALL A CAGE.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.233
>> THERE IS THAT LARGER

26:32.300 --> 26:35.233
QUESTION, THEY NEED TO HAVE --

26:35.300 --> 26:36.500
FIRST SURGE IS COMMITTING TO

26:36.566 --> 26:37.833
HAVE MORE FACILITIES, THEY NEED

26:37.900 --> 26:38.900
TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO DEAL

26:38.966 --> 26:46.266
WITH PEOPLE HUMANELY.

26:46.333 --> 26:46.866
MOST ASYLUM-SEEKERS DON'T GET

26:46.933 --> 26:49.100
ACCEPTED AND GO BACK HOME BUT WE

26:49.166 --> 26:51.366
NEED A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT

26:51.433 --> 26:52.766
IMMIGRATION.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.033
TRUMP'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WAS

26:54.100 --> 26:56.333
TO TURN EVERYBODY IN FAVOR OF

26:56.400 --> 26:57.433
IMMIGRANTS, 85% OF DEMOCRATS,

26:57.500 --> 26:59.700
SICKLY 5% OF REPUBLICANS

26:59.766 --> 27:01.900
ACCORDING TO GALLUP, JOE BIDEN

27:01.966 --> 27:02.366
SHOULD RUN WITH THAT.

27:02.433 --> 27:04.200
>> Bill: HOW DID HE GET

27:04.266 --> 27:06.200
ELECTED ON "I'M GOING TO BUILD A

27:06.266 --> 27:06.866
WALL."

27:06.933 --> 27:09.100
>> HE GOT ELECTED BY GETTING THE

27:09.166 --> 27:09.666
SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF VOTES

27:09.733 --> 27:12.900
THAT YOU CAN GET.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.700
>> HE GOT ELECTED BECAUSE

27:14.766 --> 27:15.433
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF

27:15.500 --> 27:16.766
IMMIGRANTS, THE ONES WHO HAVE

27:16.833 --> 27:18.200
BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND ARE YOUR

27:18.266 --> 27:19.166
NEIGHBORS AND EVERYONE IS IN

27:19.233 --> 27:20.200
FAVOR OF THEM AND THE ONES

27:20.266 --> 27:21.166
COMING TO THE BORDER THAT

27:21.233 --> 27:22.400
THEY'VE BEEN TOLD ARE MEMBERS OF

27:22.466 --> 27:25.233
THE CARTEL AND THEY ARE GOING TO

27:25.300 --> 27:32.233
RRAPE YOUR CHILDREN.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.666
WHEN YOU ABANDON THE BORDER AS A

27:34.733 --> 27:35.266
PART OF IMMIGRATION, YOU LOSE.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.500
YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT BORDER

27:37.566 --> 27:38.200
SECURITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH

27:38.266 --> 27:39.700
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER.

27:39.766 --> 27:41.666
>> THE WAY TO SECURE THE BORDER

27:41.733 --> 27:43.300
IT'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE PASS

27:43.366 --> 27:44.933
THROUGH LEGALLY, LET ANYONE WHO

27:45.000 --> 27:48.100
WANTS TO COME HERE WHO'S NOT

27:48.166 --> 27:48.700
INFECTED WITH A COMMUNICABLE

27:48.766 --> 27:50.033
DISEASE OR HAS A VIOLENT

27:50.100 --> 27:51.600
CRIMINAL RECORD, LET THEM COME

27:51.666 --> 27:53.100
THROUGH AND LET THEM WORK, LET

27:53.166 --> 27:57.566
THEM WORK AND LIVE AND PAY TAXES

27:57.633 --> 27:57.800
LEGALLY.

27:57.866 --> 28:00.000
THE BAD PEOPLE WILL START COMING

28:00.066 --> 28:00.533
IN OTHER PLACES.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.800
>> IF THAT WAS JOE BIDEN'S

28:02.866 --> 28:03.733
POSITION, HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT

28:03.800 --> 28:04.533
OF THE UNITED STATES.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.933
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S RIGHT OR

28:07.000 --> 28:07.233
WRONG.

28:07.300 --> 28:10.133
>> HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP PRETTY

28:10.200 --> 28:10.833
HANDILY AND UNLIKE MOST

28:10.900 --> 28:12.733
DEMOCRATS HE WAS VERY

28:12.800 --> 28:14.166
PRO-IMMIGRANT BECAUSE THE

28:14.233 --> 28:16.133
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN

28:16.200 --> 28:17.100
OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO

28:17.166 --> 28:17.400
IMMIGRANTS.

28:17.466 --> 28:18.300
>> HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE

28:18.366 --> 28:20.700
UNITED STATES BY 45,000 VOTES,

28:20.766 --> 28:21.166
NEVER FORGET THAT.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.200
>> Bill: WHAT?

28:24.266 --> 28:26.833
>> IF THE 45,000 VOTES HAD

28:26.900 --> 28:29.166
SWITCHED IN THREE STATES,

28:29.233 --> 28:29.700
DONALD TRUMP WOULD'VE BEEN

28:29.766 --> 28:30.033
REELECTED TO.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.833
>> Bill: THAT'S HOW HE GOT

28:31.900 --> 28:32.166
ELECTED.

28:32.233 --> 28:35.100
>> TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY.

28:35.166 --> 28:35.766
>> Bill: THAT'S CLOSER THAN

28:35.833 --> 28:39.900
WHAT HE WON.

28:39.966 --> 28:41.833
>> YOU AND I HAVE HAD THIS

28:41.900 --> 28:44.366
DISCUSSION.

28:44.433 --> 28:45.566
IF >> Bill: IT'S ABOUT YOUR

28:45.633 --> 28:45.766
STATE!

28:45.833 --> 28:50.833
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THAT UP!

28:50.900 --> 28:51.766
>> WE GET THREE ELECTORAL VOTES.

28:51.833 --> 28:56.500
>> Bill: YOU GET FOUR

28:56.566 --> 28:58.166
SENATORS, IF THE DAKOTA

28:58.233 --> 28:59.500
TERRITORY, CALIFORNIA WITH

28:59.566 --> 29:01.266
40 MILLION PEOPLE GETS THE SAME

29:01.333 --> 29:03.333
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.200
>> THE DAM CONSTITUTION, WANT TO

29:05.266 --> 29:06.600
BE GOING TO DO?

29:06.666 --> 29:07.800
>> Bill: NOW WITH THE

29:07.866 --> 29:08.133
CONSTITUTION!

29:08.200 --> 29:11.266
I WANT TO BRING IN A LITTLE

29:11.333 --> 29:13.133
ECONOMICS HERE, WE JUST PASSED

29:13.200 --> 29:14.000
THIS GIANT BILL, NICE THINGS ARE

29:14.066 --> 29:16.066
HAPPENING HERE THAT WE ARE ALL

29:16.133 --> 29:17.366
HAPPY ABOUT, CHILD POVERTY HAS

29:17.433 --> 29:18.666
BEEN CUT IN HALF.

29:18.733 --> 29:20.300
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S FOR

29:20.366 --> 29:22.100
CHILD POVERTY BUT LET ME GIVE

29:22.166 --> 29:22.733
YOU THE ECONOMIC RECAP BECAUSE

29:22.800 --> 29:31.366
PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW.

29:31.433 --> 29:32.000
I HEAR THE ECONOMY IS READY TO

29:32.066 --> 29:32.633
SIZZLE AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO

29:32.700 --> 29:33.233
HAVE THE ROARING '20s AGAIN --

29:33.300 --> 29:33.866
MAY BE, OR MAYBE THE DEPRESSION

29:33.933 --> 29:36.100
30s, I DON'T KNOW.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.566
MARKET VALUE IS AT 32 TIMES

29:38.633 --> 29:41.133
EARNINGS, THE NORM IS 16 TIMES,

29:41.200 --> 29:42.600
32 TIMES WHAT A COMPANY IS

29:42.666 --> 29:43.933
REALLY WORTH IS WHAT THE MARKET

29:44.000 --> 29:45.066
IS VALUED AT AND THAT'S TWICE

29:45.133 --> 29:47.566
WHAT IT NORMALLY IS.

29:47.633 --> 29:50.333
OKAY.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.366
FEDERAL DEBT STANDS AT 100% OF

29:53.433 --> 29:54.700
GDP.

29:54.766 --> 29:55.233
ONLY THE SECOND TIME SINCE

29:55.300 --> 29:56.066
WORLD WAR II, THE FEDERAL DEBT

29:56.133 --> 29:57.500
IS BIGGER THAN THE SIZE OF THE

29:57.566 --> 29:58.300
ECONOMY, THE DEBT IS BIGGER THAN

29:58.366 --> 30:01.933
THE ECONOMY ITSELF.

30:02.033 --> 30:05.400
OKAY.

30:05.466 --> 30:06.000
BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940 WHEN WE

30:06.066 --> 30:08.666
HAD -- THAT'S THE DEPRESSION,

30:08.733 --> 30:11.733
THEY SPENT 6% OF GDP ON THE

30:11.800 --> 30:13.300
DEPRESSION.

30:13.366 --> 30:17.133
IN RECESSIONS BETWEEN 1945 AND

30:17.200 --> 30:19.266
2008, 1% OF GDP TO GET OUT OF

30:19.333 --> 30:19.733
SHIT.

30:19.800 --> 30:25.300
NOW, WE SPEND 26% OF GDP IN 12

30:25.366 --> 30:26.766
MONTHS.

30:26.833 --> 30:27.733
IT'S $5 TRILLION TO FIGHT THE

30:27.800 --> 30:35.233
PANDEMIC PROBLEMS, $4 TRILLION

30:35.300 --> 30:36.733
TO WIN WORLD WAR II, WE SPENT A

30:36.800 --> 30:39.266
TRILLION MORE ON THIS THAN

30:39.333 --> 30:40.166
WORLD WAR II.

30:40.233 --> 30:42.566
MAYBE THIS WILL WORK OUT, I

30:42.633 --> 30:44.133
DON'T KNOW.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.433
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS NEW

30:45.500 --> 30:46.866
IDEOLOGY BROUGHT ON BY THE

30:46.933 --> 30:48.766
PANDEMIC THAT YOU CAN DREAM UP

30:48.833 --> 30:49.800
ANY NUMBER.

30:49.866 --> 30:51.266
I REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA WAS

30:51.333 --> 30:52.366
BAILING US OUT OF THE GREAT

30:52.433 --> 30:55.733
RECESSION AND IT WAS 780 BILLION

30:55.800 --> 30:57.100
AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE HOLY FUCK,

30:57.166 --> 31:00.533
HE SIGNED A PAPER FOR 780 -- AND

31:00.600 --> 31:02.833
NOW THEY SIGN THIS LIKE IT'S THE

31:02.900 --> 31:07.200
DINNER CHECK.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.000
[LAUGHTER]

31:08.066 --> 31:10.400
THOUGHTS?

31:10.466 --> 31:13.300
>> THE FIRST THING IS THE

31:13.366 --> 31:13.866
DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAW WHAT

31:13.933 --> 31:16.500
HAPPENED DURING THE TRUMP YEARS.

31:16.566 --> 31:18.166
TRUMP SPENT LIKE A DRUNKEN

31:18.233 --> 31:20.266
SAILOR, HE GAVE AWAY BILLIONS OF

31:20.333 --> 31:21.166
DOLLARS TO MAJOR CORPORATIONS

31:21.233 --> 31:30.566
WHO WE BAILED OUT.

31:30.633 --> 31:31.066
>> Bill: THE REPUBLICANS

31:31.133 --> 31:31.700
DEFTLY PUT US IN DEBT WAY MORE

31:31.766 --> 31:32.133
THAN THE DEMOCRATS.

31:32.200 --> 31:32.400
>> RIGHT.

31:32.466 --> 31:34.500
>> Bill: THEY ALWAYS DO.

31:34.566 --> 31:35.966
AND IN THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO PUT

31:36.033 --> 31:36.933
IN AN REPUBLICANS ACT LIKE I

31:37.000 --> 31:40.500
DON'T KNOW WHO SPENT ALL THIS

31:40.566 --> 31:42.466
MONEY LIKE I BLACKOUT DRUNK.

31:42.533 --> 31:43.800
>> THE POINT IS WHEN IS IT THE

31:43.866 --> 31:45.133
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE, THE

31:45.200 --> 31:46.566
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE PLANS

31:46.633 --> 31:48.966
AND THE ONE THAT WAS JUST PASSED

31:49.033 --> 31:51.233
IS I THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATELY

31:51.300 --> 31:52.300
TARGETED TO THE LOWER QUARTILE

31:52.366 --> 31:54.766
AND IT WILL IN FACT ENCOURAGE

31:54.833 --> 31:56.733
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND YOU COULD

31:56.800 --> 31:57.333
SEE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WOULD

31:57.400 --> 31:57.933
HELP PAY FOR IT, I'M NOT GOING

31:58.000 --> 32:00.333
TO SAY IT WILL PAY FOR ITSELF

32:00.400 --> 32:02.066
BUT IT'S LIKE WHEN IS IT THE

32:02.133 --> 32:03.500
TURN OF THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS

32:03.566 --> 32:05.533
TO ACTUALLY GET A BREAK FROM

32:05.600 --> 32:06.300
GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF SEEING IT

32:06.366 --> 32:09.933
ALWAYS GO TO THE RICHEST?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.066
>> I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE

32:11.133 --> 32:12.300
WITH YOU BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT

32:12.366 --> 32:14.400
IF MOST OF THIS WAS GOING TO

32:14.466 --> 32:17.766
DEAL WITH COVID, 5% ACCORDING TO

32:17.833 --> 32:19.266
THE COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE

32:19.333 --> 32:22.366
FEDERAL BUDGET, IT'S NOT GOING

32:22.433 --> 32:24.766
TO LOWER QUARTILE PEOPLE.

32:24.833 --> 32:25.866
IN THIS OUR EXPANDED OBAMACARE

32:25.933 --> 32:29.233
SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO HOUSEHOLDS

32:29.300 --> 32:30.800
MAKING 585,000.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.900
THERE ARE CHILD TAX CREDITS THAT

32:32.966 --> 32:35.233
MAX OUT AT HOUSEHOLDS MAKING

32:35.300 --> 32:35.533
$400,000.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.466
ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCAMS THAT

32:36.533 --> 32:39.333
HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THE ENTIRE

32:39.400 --> 32:41.166
21ST CENTURY AND I THINK IT

32:41.233 --> 32:42.900
STARTED WITH GEORGE W. BUSH

32:42.966 --> 32:44.300
GIVING FREE AND REDUCED PRICED

32:44.366 --> 32:46.200
DRUGS TO SENIORS WHO ARE

32:46.266 --> 32:48.566
WEALTHY, BACK IN MEDICARE PART

32:48.633 --> 32:50.533
D, NOW YOU ARE SHOVELING MONEY

32:50.600 --> 32:51.333
AT PEOPLE LIKE EVERYONE AT THIS

32:51.400 --> 32:53.633
TABLE WHO DON'T NEED IT, WHO

32:53.700 --> 32:54.966
HAVEN'T BEEN HURT ECONOMICALLY

32:55.033 --> 32:56.333
BY THE PANDEMIC AND WE ARE

32:56.400 --> 32:58.333
SAYING WE ARE HELPING THOSE POOR

32:58.400 --> 32:58.533
KIDS.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.533
CHECK BACK AND SEE.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.366
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE WE GOT TO

33:04.433 --> 33:05.233
THIS MENTAL PLACE WHERE --

33:05.300 --> 33:05.900
[APPLAUSE]

33:05.966 --> 33:08.700
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE

33:08.766 --> 33:09.866
DEBT IS OUT OF CONTROL SINCE

33:09.933 --> 33:11.300
ROSS PEROT FOR 30 YEARS, OH, MY

33:11.366 --> 33:13.033
GOD, THIS DEBT.

33:13.100 --> 33:13.666
WE GOT TO A POINT WHERE IT WAS

33:13.733 --> 33:15.400
SO OUT OF CONTROL AND TRUMP JUST

33:15.466 --> 33:17.000
WENT FUCK AT AND HE MADE IT WAY

33:17.066 --> 33:18.600
WORSE IN A QUICK AMOUNT OF TIME

33:18.666 --> 33:20.100
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THIS

33:20.166 --> 33:22.933
PLACE NOW WHERE IT'S LIKE --

33:23.033 --> 33:24.333
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE AT 4:00 A.M.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.700
AND YOU'RE DRUNK OUT OF YOUR

33:25.766 --> 33:28.733
MIND, I MIGHT AS WELL JUST STAY

33:28.800 --> 33:29.066
UP.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.266
WHY TRY TO GET TO SLEEP AT ALL?

33:31.333 --> 33:33.533
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO PULL

33:33.600 --> 33:34.266
THIS OFF.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.900
>> TWO IS TOO MANY AND FIVE IS

33:35.966 --> 33:36.200
NOT ENOUGH.

33:36.266 --> 33:40.100
>> Bill: IT IS APPARENTLY

33:40.166 --> 33:41.200
FUNNY MONEY ANYWAY.

33:41.266 --> 33:43.033
>> THE RECKONING IS GOING TO BE

33:43.100 --> 33:45.100
BRUTAL BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

33:45.166 --> 33:46.766
GROWING SOMETHING LIKE 4%

33:46.833 --> 33:47.600
ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND IT'S GOING

33:47.666 --> 33:48.333
TO DO WELL WITHOUT THIS.

33:48.400 --> 33:53.400
IT'S GOING TO BE SUPE SUPERCHARD

33:53.466 --> 33:56.233
BUT IT'S A COKE BINGE, EVEN

33:56.300 --> 33:59.300
MARXIST ECONOMISTS AT UMASS

33:59.366 --> 34:00.933
AMHERST SAID WHEN YOU RUN THIS

34:01.000 --> 34:03.266
LEVEL OF DEBT WITH NO SIGN OF

34:03.333 --> 34:03.900
STOPPING IT REDUCES LONG-TERM

34:03.966 --> 34:04.900
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THAT'S ONE

34:04.966 --> 34:06.466
OF THE REASONS WHY FOR THE PAST

34:06.533 --> 34:08.600
20 YEARS WE HAD LITTLE ECONOMIC

34:08.666 --> 34:08.833
GROWTH.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.533
>> Bill: SO MUCH OF THE BUDGET

34:10.600 --> 34:11.900
IS THE PAY OFF THE DEBT, JUST A

34:11.966 --> 34:14.566
PAID BANKERS WHO ARE LENDING YOU

34:14.633 --> 34:14.866
THIS MONEY.

34:14.933 --> 34:16.500
>> IF INTEREST RATES GO UP FROM

34:16.566 --> 34:17.666
WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW WHICH

34:17.733 --> 34:20.833
IS ZERO, WE WILL SPEND -- WE MAY

34:20.900 --> 34:22.266
EXCEED IN OUR INTEREST PAYMENTS

34:22.333 --> 34:24.133
WHAT WE SPEND ON NATIONAL

34:24.200 --> 34:24.366
DEFENSE.

34:24.433 --> 34:28.133
I'M NOT DEFENDING THE DEBT, I AM

34:28.200 --> 34:28.600
DEFENDING THAT THE

34:28.666 --> 34:29.466
PRIORITIZATION THAT WE'VE SEEN

34:29.533 --> 34:31.566
IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN

34:31.633 --> 34:32.300
WAY OFF THE MARK IN TERMS OF

34:32.366 --> 34:34.033
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED.

34:34.100 --> 34:37.633
>> THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

34:37.700 --> 34:39.366
THIS.

34:39.433 --> 34:41.366
>> IT DOES, TO TRY AND BALANCE

34:41.433 --> 34:43.000
THIS AND TO SET IT RIGHT AT SOME

34:43.066 --> 34:43.533
POINT INTO THE FUTURE.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.933
BUT YOU'RE SAYING I'LL BAIL YOU

34:48.000 --> 34:49.700
UP TO THE TROUGH WHEN TRUMP WAS

34:49.766 --> 34:51.500
THERE AND NOW BIDEN HAS TO HAVE

34:51.566 --> 34:54.333
THE POLICY OF AUSTERITY, GIVE ME

34:54.400 --> 34:55.233
A BREAK.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.766
>> IS NOT AUSTERITY, GIVE POOR

34:56.833 --> 34:57.666
PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING MONEY,

34:57.733 --> 34:59.966
LET PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING WELL

35:00.033 --> 35:05.066
PAY THEIR OWN WAY.

35:05.133 --> 35:06.800
>> Bill: THAT SHOULD BE THE

35:06.866 --> 35:07.233
DEMOCRATIC POSITION.

35:07.300 --> 35:10.766
>> I WAS NOT A FAN OF THE

35:10.833 --> 35:11.766
$2,000, I THOUGHT THAT WASN'T

35:11.833 --> 35:12.800
TARGETED ENOUGH, I THOUGHT WE

35:12.866 --> 35:14.100
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE

35:14.166 --> 35:16.100
CLEVER ABOUT HOW WE DID IT AND

35:16.166 --> 35:16.900
WHERE WE MADE THE INVESTMENTS,

35:16.966 --> 35:18.633
WE COULD HAVE DONE GREAT

35:18.700 --> 35:19.266
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WITH

35:19.333 --> 35:21.933
THAT MONEY.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.300
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

35:23.366 --> 35:26.066
BUT I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE SITTING

35:26.133 --> 35:27.233
AROUND AND CRITICIZING DEMOCRATS

35:27.300 --> 35:28.866
FOR TAX AND SPEND WHEN EVERY

35:28.933 --> 35:30.533
TIME WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN

35:30.600 --> 35:31.933
PRESIDENT, WE GO INTO THE DEBT

35:32.000 --> 35:36.500
AND DEFICIT.

35:36.566 --> 35:38.033
>> Bill: SOMEHOW, EVEN THOUGH

35:38.100 --> 35:39.966
IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME, THIS

35:40.033 --> 35:41.166
PATTERN EVERY TIME OF THE

35:41.233 --> 35:42.766
DEMOCRATS COME IN AND CLEAN UP

35:42.833 --> 35:45.133
THE ROOM THAT LED ZEPPELIN JUST

35:45.200 --> 35:51.100
TRASHED AND THEN THEY ASK WHO'S

35:51.166 --> 35:52.566
THE PARTY OF FISCAL

35:52.633 --> 35:53.066
RESPONSIBILITY?

35:53.133 --> 35:55.233
IT'S THE REPUBLICANS, WHAT FUCK

35:55.300 --> 35:56.233
MOVIE ARE YOU WATCHING?

35:56.300 --> 35:58.100
>> DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, WE

35:58.166 --> 36:00.533
HAVE TAPES AND WE HAVE NUMBERS

36:00.600 --> 36:01.800
AND WE HAVE HISTORY.

36:01.866 --> 36:03.233
>> Bill: REAGAN DID IT,

36:03.300 --> 36:04.366
BUSH -- ALL RIGHT.

36:04.433 --> 36:08.500
THE CHANGE THAT SUBJECT

36:08.566 --> 36:09.600
COMPLETELY, TURNER CLASSICS, I

36:09.666 --> 36:11.800
LIKE TURNER CLASSICS, I ONCE DID

36:11.866 --> 36:14.100
A THING FOR THEM BUT IN THIS NEW

36:14.166 --> 36:16.266
ERA, THEY HAD TO REFRAME THE

36:16.333 --> 36:17.466
CLASSICS, THEY HAD TO HAVE A GUY

36:17.533 --> 36:18.933
COME ON AT THE BEGINNING --

36:19.000 --> 36:19.266
THERE IT IS.

36:19.333 --> 36:22.933
I'M NOT LYING.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.933
AND GIVE A LITTLE SPEECH ABOUT

36:25.000 --> 36:26.133
WHY MOVIES YOU USED TO JUST

36:26.200 --> 36:29.033
ENJOY BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTOOD

36:29.100 --> 36:31.233
THAT TIMES CHANGE, PEOPLE CHANGE

36:31.300 --> 36:33.000
AND MORAYS CHANGE, IT'S CALLED

36:33.066 --> 36:35.033
EVOLUTION, BUT NOW IT'S CALLED

36:35.100 --> 36:38.300
PROBLEMATIC.

36:38.366 --> 36:38.566
[APPLAUSE]

36:38.633 --> 36:41.266
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.966
GONE WITH THE WIND IS ON THE

36:44.033 --> 36:46.200
LIST, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, MY

36:46.266 --> 36:47.500
FAIR LADY.

36:47.566 --> 36:49.933
MY FAIR LADY IS TOO ROUGH FOR

36:50.000 --> 36:50.900
THEM?

36:50.966 --> 36:52.766
IT WAS TOO CORNY FOR ME WHEN I

36:52.833 --> 36:53.000
WAS TEN.

36:53.066 --> 36:54.100
MY FATHER WANTED ME TO GO SEE

36:54.166 --> 36:56.733
IT, I WOULDN'T.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.166
THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY MOVIES,

36:58.233 --> 36:58.800
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE SOME OF

36:58.866 --> 36:59.866
THE OTHER ONES THAT THEY HAVE TO

36:59.933 --> 37:02.900
GIVE WARNINGS TO NOW, THE

37:02.966 --> 37:03.166
CLASSICS?

37:03.233 --> 37:05.500
I'M SURE YOU WOULD.

37:05.566 --> 37:07.666
THESE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER

37:07.733 --> 37:08.633
ONES, I DON'T THINK THESE NEED

37:08.700 --> 37:12.766
WARNINGS BUT THEY HAVE IT.

37:12.833 --> 37:13.933
SLEEPING BEAUTY: A PRINCE KISSES

37:14.000 --> 37:14.200

37:43.533 --> 37:44.566

37:44.633 --> 37:48.766
VICTIMS.

37:48.833 --> 37:49.933

[LAUGHTER]

38:03.133 --> 38:05.966
[APPLAUSE]

38:06.033 --> 38:07.333

PORTRAYS IN A POSITIVE LIGHT A

38:08.133 --> 38:10.300
POWER IMBALANCE, BETWEEN MARY A

38:34.933 --> 38:37.266
I SWEAR TO GOD, I DON'T WANT TO

38:37.333 --> 38:38.533
TALK ABOUT COUNCIL CULTURE AND

38:38.600 --> 38:40.833
THIS NONSENSE EVERY WEEK BUT I

38:40.900 --> 38:43.233
JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE

38:43.300 --> 38:44.733
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS IS A

38:44.800 --> 38:46.666
TSUNAMI AND HOW FAST THE

38:46.733 --> 38:47.300
GOALPOSTS CHANGE COME ALMOST ON

38:47.366 --> 38:49.500
A WEEKLY BASIS.

38:49.566 --> 38:50.700
LITERALLY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

38:50.766 --> 38:52.233
BEFORE I CAME OUT, I WROTE DOWN

38:52.300 --> 38:55.200
THREE THINGS I COULD THINK OF.

38:55.266 --> 38:56.800
NOT JUST WHAT YOU DO NOW, WHAT

38:56.866 --> 38:57.733
YOU DO NOW, IT'S EVERYTHING

38:57.800 --> 38:59.766
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

38:59.833 --> 39:02.133
I'LL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF THAT.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.666
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY, WHAT

39:05.733 --> 39:07.033
YOU SAY, NOW IT'S WHAT YOU

39:07.100 --> 39:08.700
LISTEN TO, THEY CAN GET YOU FOR

39:08.766 --> 39:08.900
THAT.

39:08.966 --> 39:12.866
WHAT YOU ORDER, WHO YOU SAY YOU

39:12.933 --> 39:16.200
WOULD LIKE, SORT OF ASSOCIATION,

39:16.266 --> 39:16.800
IF YOU RETWEET SOMETHING -- I

39:16.866 --> 39:20.633
LIKE THIS PICTURE -- WHO WAS THE

39:20.700 --> 39:30.666
WOMAN IN THE MAND MANDALORIAN.

39:30.733 --> 39:35.600
>> SHE WAS A NAZI.

39:35.666 --> 39:41.800
>> Bill: SHE IS A!

39:41.866 --> 39:45.100
>> SHE DOES HANG WITH WHITE

39:45.166 --> 39:46.766
SUPREMACISTS, I SUPPOSE I'M NOW

39:46.833 --> 39:47.366
SUBJECT TO DEFAMATION.

39:47.433 --> 39:48.833
>> Bill: IT DEPENDS WHAT YOUR

39:48.900 --> 39:50.200
DEFINITION OF WHITE SUPREMACIST

39:50.266 --> 39:51.166
IS, THE GOAL POST THEIR CHANGE A

39:51.233 --> 39:52.466
LOT, IT USED TO BE A GUY IN A

39:52.533 --> 39:54.900
CLAN HOOD.

39:54.966 --> 39:56.866
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

39:56.933 --> 39:58.866
CAREFUL, THERE'S TWO THINGS

39:58.933 --> 40:00.033
REPUBLICANS THINK THEY ARE GOING

40:00.100 --> 40:03.200
TO GET BY ON, CANCEL CULTURE IN

40:03.266 --> 40:05.166
THIS WHOLE DR. SEUSS STUFF WHERE

40:05.233 --> 40:06.566
THEY ARE READING GREEN EGGS AND

40:06.633 --> 40:07.200
HAM PROVING THESE CENTERS CAN

40:07.266 --> 40:10.800
ACTUALLY READ.

40:10.866 --> 40:11.066
[LAUGHTER]

40:11.133 --> 40:12.633
[APPLAUSE]

40:12.700 --> 40:14.966
AND IMMIGRATION.

40:15.033 --> 40:17.600
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT WE

40:17.666 --> 40:21.400
GOT DONALD TRUMP IN PART BECAUE

40:21.466 --> 40:23.700
OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

40:23.766 --> 40:25.600
WHEN PEOPLE SAY TELLS IT THE WAY

40:25.666 --> 40:27.233
IT IS, THE GUY LIED EVERY DAY,

40:27.300 --> 40:28.466
REPEATEDLY AND THE REASON WHY

40:28.533 --> 40:29.466
THEY THOUGHT HE TOLD IT THE WAY

40:29.533 --> 40:31.700
IT IS BECAUSE HE WASN'T

40:31.766 --> 40:33.100
POLITICALLY CORRECT.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.466
WHEN PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE TO

40:34.533 --> 40:35.533
PARSE EVERY WORD AND I CAN'T

40:35.600 --> 40:37.700
THINK ABOUT THIS, THAT IS WHAT

40:37.766 --> 40:39.566
IS GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZY,

40:39.633 --> 40:40.866
IT'S GOING TO FURTHER DIVIDE

40:40.933 --> 40:41.966
CULTURALLY THIS COUNTRY.

40:42.033 --> 40:44.466
BUT I AM SO SICK OF THE

40:44.533 --> 40:46.766
REPUBLICANS USING THE PHRASE

40:46.833 --> 40:47.333
"CANCEL CULTURE" TO SOMEHOW

40:47.400 --> 40:50.700
VICTIMIZE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

40:50.766 --> 40:52.500
>> Bill: OF COURSE THEY ARE

40:52.566 --> 40:53.333
GOING TO.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.333
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM AND I

40:54.400 --> 40:57.933
REALIZE YOU ARE A RECOVERING

40:58.000 --> 40:59.466
SENATOR BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT

40:59.533 --> 41:00.833
THIS IN TERMS OF REPUBLICANS AND

41:00.900 --> 41:02.033
DEMOCRATS AND WHO'S GOING TO WIN

41:02.100 --> 41:03.700
A SEAT IN THE SENATE OR THE

41:03.766 --> 41:04.466
HOUSE, LET'S TALK ABOUT

41:04.533 --> 41:06.533
DIFFERENT -- AND DAVID SURE YOUR

41:06.600 --> 41:08.900
PREVIOUS GUESTS, HE WAS CANCELED

41:08.966 --> 41:11.566

41:11.633 --> 41:12.800
LINK TO A PRINCETON POLITICAL

41:12.866 --> 41:13.466
SCIENTIST WHO HAPPENS TO BE

41:19.433 --> 41:20.733
1960s ON ELECTION, DAVID SURE

41:20.800 --> 41:22.966
GOT FIRED BECAUSE OF THAT.

41:23.033 --> 41:25.100
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING

41:25.166 --> 41:26.700
ABOUT.

41:26.766 --> 41:27.366
WE NEED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND

41:27.433 --> 41:30.900
OF CONVERSATION AND IT NOT

41:30.966 --> 41:32.366
LOOKING TO BOUNCE PEOPLE ALL THE

41:32.433 --> 41:32.566
TIME.

41:32.633 --> 41:35.166
>> WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE WRONG

41:35.233 --> 41:35.966
PERPETRATOR.

41:36.033 --> 41:39.333
YOU TAKE "TEEN VOGUE," THEY

41:39.400 --> 41:41.200
SHOULDN'T HAVE FIRED HER, BUCK

41:41.266 --> 41:41.366
UP.

41:41.433 --> 41:42.566
>> Bill: PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO

41:42.633 --> 41:44.000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.366
>> THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO LOST HER

41:46.433 --> 41:46.533
JOB.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.466
>> Bill: I'VE SEEN HER MANY

41:48.533 --> 41:50.866
TIMES ON MSNBC.

41:50.933 --> 41:51.133
SHE'S 27.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.333
SHE JUST GOT A GREAT JOB -- LOST

41:54.400 --> 41:57.900
A GREAT JOB.

41:57.966 --> 41:59.200
EDITOR OF "TEEN VOGUE" BECAUSE

41:59.266 --> 42:01.033
SHE TWEETED IN HIGH SCHOOL, THIS

42:01.100 --> 42:03.866
IS HIGH SCHOOL, I HAVE A LIST OF

42:03.933 --> 42:05.866
SOME OF THE TWEETS.

42:05.933 --> 42:13.100
SOME OF THEM "YOU BANDWAGON AND

42:13.166 --> 42:17.733
HOMO" YOU'RE SO GAY, LEFT MY ASS

42:17.800 --> 42:20.333
OFF.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.433
IF CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

42:21.500 --> 42:26.733
PEOPLE TALK SHIFT IN PRIVATE.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.333
WE CAN'T LEGISLATE THAT AWAY, I

42:28.400 --> 42:30.566
DON'T THINK THIS WOMAN IS A

42:30.633 --> 42:30.833
HOMOPHOBE.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.000
FOR FUCK SAKE.

42:34.066 --> 42:34.966
PEOPLE TALK SHIT ABOUT EACH

42:35.033 --> 42:39.766
OTHER IN PRIVATE.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.166
>> I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT,

42:41.233 --> 42:42.433
EVERYBODY IS LIKE THE PEOPLE OUT

42:42.500 --> 42:44.666
THERE WHO ARE EXERCISING THEIR

42:44.733 --> 42:45.466
ECONOMIC RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO

42:45.533 --> 42:46.700
SUPPORT THAT PRODUCT BECAUSE I

42:46.766 --> 42:47.333
DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU STAND

42:47.400 --> 42:49.866
FOR, THE ECONOMIC RIGHT

42:49.933 --> 42:51.366
"TEEN VOGUE" IT SHOULD HAVE SAID

42:51.433 --> 42:52.600
LOOK, THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME

42:52.666 --> 42:55.466
AGO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

42:55.533 --> 42:56.133
>> Bill: HIGH SCHOOL!

42:56.200 --> 42:59.600
>> THEY WERE SO AFRAID, IT'S

42:59.666 --> 43:00.933
LIKE BUCK UP.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.033
IF CORPORATE AMERICA NEEDS TO

43:03.100 --> 43:07.533
STOP BUYING INTO THIS STUFF AND

43:07.600 --> 43:08.633
EXCEPT.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.900
>> Bill: SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE

43:10.966 --> 43:11.200
SOME BALLS.

43:11.266 --> 43:12.433
>> CORPORATE AMERICA IS NOT

43:12.500 --> 43:13.666
INTERESTED IN DOING THAT BUT WE

43:13.733 --> 43:17.366
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE KIND OF

43:17.433 --> 43:18.866
IDEOLOGY OF WOKENESS AND ALL OF

43:18.933 --> 43:21.600
THE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, ALL THE

43:21.666 --> 43:23.233
DAMNATION OF CHRISTIANITY

43:23.300 --> 43:24.733
WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF

43:24.800 --> 43:25.933
FORGIVENESS OR SALVATION.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.166
IT IS A WORK IDEOLOGY AND IT HAS

43:28.233 --> 43:29.833
TAKEN THE PLACE OF RELIGION AND

43:29.900 --> 43:33.033
MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE IT'S

43:33.100 --> 43:34.500
THIS TOTAL PICTURE.

43:34.566 --> 43:38.700
IT IS STARKLY RIGHT AND WRONG

43:38.766 --> 43:39.500
AND IT'S DELUSIONAL.

43:39.566 --> 43:41.400
IT NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED AT THE

43:41.466 --> 43:43.233
CORPORATE LEVEL AND AT THE

43:43.300 --> 43:45.300
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, THIS IS THE

43:45.366 --> 43:47.300
FLIP SIDE AND IF YOU HEAR PEOPLE

43:47.366 --> 43:48.866
MAKING REALLY STUPID, SHITTY

43:48.933 --> 43:49.566
ASIAN-AMERICAN JOKES, YOU ALSO

43:49.633 --> 43:51.933
HAVE TO CALL OUT TO PEOPLE WHO

43:52.000 --> 43:53.433
ARE SAYING EVERYBODY IS A RACIST

43:53.500 --> 43:55.133
OR WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU WERE

43:55.200 --> 43:58.766
IN HIGH SCHOOL DEFINES YOU.

43:58.833 --> 44:00.533
>> IF YOU LEARNED ANYTHING FROM

44:00.600 --> 44:05.066
THE PREVIOUS GUESTS C, THE SMALL

44:05.133 --> 44:06.300
SLIVER OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER

44:06.366 --> 44:07.500
CAUSING THIS TROUBLE, WOKENESS

44:07.566 --> 44:10.633
IS NOT A BIG POLITICAL MOVEMENT.

44:10.700 --> 44:11.600
>> IT'S BIG AND PUBLISHING BIG

44:11.666 --> 44:13.900
IN UNIVERSITIES.

44:13.966 --> 44:15.200
IT'S BIG IN CORPORATE AMERICA.

44:15.266 --> 44:15.766
>> THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE

44:15.833 --> 44:19.700
CHICKEN SHIT, THEY DON'T WANT TO

44:19.766 --> 44:20.966
TAKE A RISK TO PUBLISH

44:21.033 --> 44:21.766
SOMETHING, UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS

44:21.833 --> 44:23.833
ARE THE WORST, THEY DON'T WANT

44:23.900 --> 44:24.266
ANY CONTROVERSY ON

44:24.333 --> 44:25.600
UNIVERSITIES -- WE CAN'T HAVE

44:25.666 --> 44:27.966
THAT PERSON, YOU KNOW WHAT?

44:28.033 --> 44:30.400
YOUR UNIVERSITY, HE SHOULD HAVE

44:30.466 --> 44:31.466
ALL VIEWS PRESENTED AND PROTECT

44:31.533 --> 44:34.066
PEOPLE AND THEY COME ON YOUR

44:34.133 --> 44:34.300
CAMPUS.

44:34.366 --> 44:38.133
[APPLAUSE]

44:38.200 --> 44:39.833
>> THIS IS LIKE THE

44:39.900 --> 44:40.466
UNITED NATIONS IN THE WORLD

44:40.533 --> 44:42.233
OUTSIDE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.866
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO

44:44.933 --> 44:45.800
ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE "I AM

44:45.866 --> 44:49.000
HURT WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING" OR

44:49.066 --> 44:49.900
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING

44:49.966 --> 44:52.266
THAT OFFENDS ME, THAT IS THE

44:52.333 --> 44:52.766
EQUIVALENT OF VIOLENCE.

44:52.833 --> 44:55.066
THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.

44:55.133 --> 44:56.633
WORDS ARE NOT THE EQUIVALENT OF

44:56.700 --> 44:57.566
VIOLENCE AND WE NEED TO GET BACK

44:57.633 --> 45:00.133
TO A ROBUST UNDERSTANDING.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.733
>> I'M SAYING THE NUMBER OF

45:01.800 --> 45:02.933
PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THAT SPACE ARE

45:03.033 --> 45:07.100
VERY MINIMAL AND THOSE PEOPLE

45:07.166 --> 45:12.433
ARE EXPLOITED IN THE ERA OF WE

45:12.500 --> 45:13.166
WANT TO NOT POLITICIZE HOW YOU

45:13.233 --> 45:16.300
FEEL KIND OF ERA.

45:16.366 --> 45:18.466
>> YOU'RE NOT SAYING THIS IS

45:18.533 --> 45:19.566
REPUBLICANS ARE JUST RUNNING

45:19.633 --> 45:19.766
THIS.

45:19.833 --> 45:22.233
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT HAPPENS ON

45:22.300 --> 45:24.266
BOTH SIDES, THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS

45:24.333 --> 45:25.433
IS JUST LIKE WOKENESS LIKE

45:25.500 --> 45:25.700
WOKENESS.

45:25.766 --> 45:28.033
>> Bill: THEY ARE SNOWFLAKES

45:28.100 --> 45:29.600
TOO.

45:29.666 --> 45:33.600
BUT THEY DON'T CONTROL THE MEDIA

45:33.666 --> 45:35.233
THE WAY THESE BRATS DO.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.033
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

45:36.100 --> 45:40.533
I DON'T THINK IT WAS REPUBLICAN

45:40.600 --> 45:40.833
REPUBLICANS.

45:40.900 --> 45:42.533
>> THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

45:42.600 --> 45:43.800
REPUBLICANS AT "TEEN VOGUE" OR

45:43.866 --> 45:44.100
CONDE NAST.

45:44.166 --> 45:44.900
>> Bill: I NEVER THOUGHT I

45:44.966 --> 45:47.900
WOULD LIVE IN AN ERA, I REMEMBER

45:47.966 --> 45:48.866
WATCHING MOVIES ABOUT THE 50s

45:48.933 --> 45:50.700
AND THE BLACKLIST ERA WHEN

45:50.766 --> 45:51.233
PEOPLE WOULD WHISPER YOUR

45:51.300 --> 45:53.466
COMMUNIST AND ALL IT TOOK WAS

45:53.533 --> 45:55.033
SOMEONE INFORMING ON YOU AND US

45:55.100 --> 45:57.333
SAYING THEY SAW YOU AT A RALLY

45:57.400 --> 45:59.266
OR A PEACE MARCH AND YOU ARE

45:59.333 --> 46:00.100
BRANDED IN YOUR CAREER WAS OVER

46:00.166 --> 46:03.133
OR YOU WERE ON THE BLACKLIST --

46:03.200 --> 46:03.700
PEOPLE GO TO PARTIES NOW AND

46:03.766 --> 46:05.333
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK, THEY

46:05.400 --> 46:06.333
ARE LIKE CAN I TALK?

46:06.400 --> 46:08.133
I DON'T KNOW YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

46:08.200 --> 46:12.033
SHE MIGHT BE WOKE.

46:12.100 --> 46:16.700
REALLY, I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

46:16.766 --> 46:18.333
THIS INFORMANT THING, IT'S NOT

46:18.400 --> 46:20.933
JUST WHAT YOU DO, IT'S WHAT YOU

46:21.000 --> 46:22.533
DON'T REPORT.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.700
THAT'S ANOTHER WAY THE GOALPOST

46:24.766 --> 46:24.900
MOVED.

46:24.966 --> 46:26.966
I WAS READING ABOUT THIS GUY

46:27.033 --> 46:28.000
WINSTON MARSHALL, THE BANJO

46:28.066 --> 46:33.733
PLAYER IN MUMFORD & SONS.

46:33.800 --> 46:34.400
OKAY.

46:34.466 --> 46:34.666
[LAUGHTER]

46:34.733 --> 46:35.466
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE A

46:35.533 --> 46:36.900
THING FOR ABOUT THE TIME IT TOOK

46:36.966 --> 46:42.833
TO TAKE A PISS.

46:42.900 --> 46:44.933
HE TWEETED OUT HE LIKED A BOOK,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.733
IT'S A BOOK CALLED "UNMASKED"

46:46.800 --> 46:48.933
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT, YOU'VE

46:49.000 --> 46:49.433
NEVER HEARD OF IT, IT'S

46:49.500 --> 46:52.133
APPARENTLY NOT FAVORABLE TO

46:52.200 --> 46:53.266
ANTIFA BECAUSE IT'S CRITICIZING

46:53.333 --> 46:56.666
AND TEA FOR, OKAY, PEOPLE WRITE

46:56.733 --> 46:56.866
BOOKS.

46:56.933 --> 46:58.600
HE TWEETED OUT "FINALLY HAD THE

46:58.666 --> 46:59.800
TIME TO READ YOUR IMPORTANT

46:59.866 --> 47:04.633
BOOK, YOU'RE A BRAVE MAN" TO THE

47:04.700 --> 47:05.166
AUTHOR.

47:05.233 --> 47:06.333
NOW HE HAS TO STEP AWAY,

47:06.400 --> 47:07.200
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS STEPPING AWAY

47:07.266 --> 47:09.633
FROM THE BAND.

47:09.700 --> 47:10.833
OH, MY GOD.

47:10.900 --> 47:13.833
THIS IS HIS APOLOGY, SO SOVIET.

47:13.900 --> 47:15.933
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, I HAVE

47:16.000 --> 47:17.133
COME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

47:17.200 --> 47:19.300
PAIN CAUSED BY THE BOOK I

47:19.366 --> 47:20.500
ENDORSED, WHAT?

47:20.566 --> 47:23.200
DID YOU HIT SOMEBODY OVER THE

47:23.266 --> 47:24.133
HEAD WITH ITS?

47:24.200 --> 47:24.733
[LAUGHTER]

47:24.800 --> 47:26.300
I HAVE OFFENDED NOT ONLY A LOT

47:26.366 --> 47:27.866
OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW BUT ALSO

47:27.933 --> 47:30.133
THOSE CLOSEST TO ME INCLUDING MY

47:30.200 --> 47:34.000
BANDMATES, WHAT A BUNCH OF

47:34.066 --> 47:34.700
PUSSIES THEY MUST BE, AND FOR

47:34.766 --> 47:36.433
THAT I'M TRULY SORRY.

47:36.500 --> 47:41.466
IT'S SO STALIN.

47:41.533 --> 47:42.866
HOW ABOUT I CAN READ WHAT I

47:42.933 --> 47:45.300
WANT, I'M A MUSICIAN, IT WON'T

47:45.366 --> 47:46.866
HAPPEN AGAIN.

47:46.933 --> 47:49.866
>> THIS IS ALSO CREEPING INTO

47:49.933 --> 47:50.966
LEGISLATION.

47:51.033 --> 47:53.000
IN TEXAS, THE GOVERNOR AND THE

47:53.066 --> 47:55.300
SENATE ARE POISED TO PASS A LAW

47:55.366 --> 47:59.366
THAT WOULD BASICALLY MAKE SOCIAL

47:59.433 --> 48:00.766
CONTENT MODERATION ON

48:00.833 --> 48:01.633
SOCIAL MEDIA ILLEGAL BECAUSE

48:01.700 --> 48:02.866
THEY ARE SAYING RELIGIOUS PEOPLE

48:02.933 --> 48:04.966
ARE BEING BANNED FROM TWITTER

48:05.033 --> 48:06.033
AND FACEBOOK.

48:06.100 --> 48:09.300
IN COLORADO, PEOPLE ARE BANNING

48:09.366 --> 48:10.200
HATE SPEECH ON LEGISLATORS, IT

48:10.266 --> 48:10.900
ALL CREEPS IN.

48:10.966 --> 48:12.466
IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE PRIVATE

48:12.533 --> 48:14.700
SECTOR AND WE ARE IN A

48:14.766 --> 48:15.300
PEROXISOME OF A CONTRACTION OF

48:15.366 --> 48:17.500
FREE SPEECH AND THIS IS

48:17.566 --> 48:18.166
SOMETHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

48:18.233 --> 48:20.333
BEING A CLASSIC LIBERAL, I THINK

48:20.400 --> 48:22.266
THIS IS SOMETHING LIBERTARIANS,

48:22.333 --> 48:22.866
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES CAN

48:22.933 --> 48:25.000
ALL AGREE ON, YOU NEED FREE

48:25.066 --> 48:25.233
SPEECH.

48:25.300 --> 48:32.733
>> THINK ABOUT THIS.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.500
SOUTH DAKOTA [LAUGHTER]

48:35.566 --> 48:36.600
THE GOVERNOR CHRISTIE GNOME WAS

48:36.666 --> 48:39.500
GOING TO SIGN A TRANSGENDER

48:39.566 --> 48:40.266
BILL.

48:40.333 --> 48:41.933
BY THE WAY, SAYING THEY CAN'T

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
PLAY IN GIRLS SPORTS, THAT'S THE

48:44.066 --> 48:44.466
BIGGEST ISSUE EVER IN

48:44.533 --> 48:46.733
SOUTH DAKOTA APPARENTLY, IT'S

48:46.800 --> 48:48.233
GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION

48:48.300 --> 48:49.300
ACROSS THE BOARD.

48:49.366 --> 48:50.900
GUESS WHAT?

48:50.966 --> 48:52.466
AMAZON CAME IN AND THEY SAID WE

48:52.533 --> 48:55.300
MIGHT NOT -- ALL OF A SUDDEN

48:55.366 --> 48:56.700
KRISTI NOEM GETS RELIGION AND

48:56.766 --> 48:57.533
MAYBE THAT ISN'T THE RIGHT THING

48:57.600 --> 48:58.600
TO DO SO LET'S SEE IF SHE SIGNS

48:58.666 --> 49:01.300
THE BILL.

49:01.366 --> 49:02.866
THIS IS WHERE THE USE OF

49:02.933 --> 49:03.466
ECONOMIC POWER CAN ACTUALLY BE

49:03.533 --> 49:06.166
USED TO THE GOOD.

49:06.233 --> 49:07.833
>> Bill: I WISH WE HAD TIME TO

49:07.900 --> 49:09.066

49:29.433 --> 49:31.766

49:34.066 --> 49:35.566
Q-ANON FOLLOWERS HAVE TO ADMIT

49:35.633 --> 49:35.833

49:35.900 --> 49:36.433
THEY SPENT THAT LAST TWO YEARS

49:36.500 --> 49:37.633

[LAUGHTER]

49:47.333 --> 49:52.933
[APPLAUSE]

49:53.000 --> 49:53.533
CONGRATULATIONS, GENIUSES, YOU

49:53.600 --> 49:55.233
MADE A GOD OUT OF THE GRUBHUB

49:55.300 --> 49:56.200
DELIVERY GUY.

49:56.266 --> 49:56.866
NEW RULE: THIS COMPANY THAT

49:56.933 --> 49:57.733
PROMISES TO DELIVER VIAGRA

49:57.800 --> 49:58.866
"DISCREETLY TO YOUR DOOR" HAS TO

49:58.933 --> 49:59.466
TELL ME: WHAT IS THE

49:59.533 --> 50:02.100
ALTERNATIVE?

50:02.166 --> 50:03.500
A MARCHING BAND FORMS INTO THE

50:03.566 --> 50:07.300
SHAPE OF A PENIS AND SHOWS UP

50:07.366 --> 50:08.133
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE?

50:08.200 --> 50:09.400
IT'S A BOX IN THE MAIL.

50:09.466 --> 50:10.966
WHAT'S NOT DISCREET?

50:11.033 --> 50:12.766
THE PHARMACIST AT CVS SHOUTING

50:12.833 --> 50:13.800
AFTER YOU, "REMEMBER, IF THERE'S

50:13.866 --> 50:14.766
ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR ERECTION,

50:14.833 --> 50:26.333
CALL ME!"

50:26.400 --> 50:26.800
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:26.866 --> 50:27.333
NEW RULE: MAKE SURE YOUR

50:27.400 --> 50:28.966
SYMBOLIC GESTURE DOESN'T JUST

50:29.033 --> 50:29.766
CONFUSE EVERYBODY.

50:29.833 --> 50:30.933
I'M SURE THE RED FACE PAINT OF

50:31.000 --> 50:31.866
THESE PROTESTORS IN CHILE HAS A

50:31.933 --> 50:33.400
DEEP MEANING, BUT I CAN'T HELP

50:33.466 --> 50:34.766
BUT THINK OF MY GRANDMOTHER

50:34.833 --> 50:35.666
TRYING TO PUT ON LIPSTICK IN THE

50:35.733 --> 50:45.133
CAR.

50:45.200 --> 50:45.600
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:45.666 --> 50:47.266
NEW RULE: STOP USING THE PHRASE

50:47.333 --> 50:47.800
"PLAIN VANILLA."

50:47.866 --> 50:49.600
VANILLA IS A FLAVOR JUST LIKE

50:49.666 --> 50:49.866
ANY OTHER.

50:49.933 --> 50:51.033
IT COMES FROM THE VANILLA BEAN.

50:51.100 --> 50:51.700
YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER FLAVOR COMES

50:51.766 --> 50:52.700
FROM A BEAN?

50:52.766 --> 50:53.800
CHOCOLATE.

50:53.866 --> 50:55.000
BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THE

50:55.066 --> 50:55.766
MAINSTREAM MEDIA USING THE TERM

50:55.833 --> 50:57.900
"PLAIN CHOCOLATE."

50:57.966 --> 50:58.466
BUT "PLAIN VANILLA" - THAT'S

50:58.533 --> 50:59.066
SOMEHOW OKAY.

50:59.133 --> 51:00.000
WELL, IT ISN'T OKAY.

51:00.066 --> 51:01.433
I'M TUCKER CARLSON.

51:01.500 --> 51:11.333
GOOD NIGHT.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.900
[LAUGHTER]

51:13.966 --> 51:15.566
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

51:15.633 --> 51:22.533
TRYING TO GET MY TUCKER FACE.

51:22.600 --> 51:23.266
[LAUGHTER]

51:23.333 --> 51:23.866
NEW RULE: SOMEONE HAS TO TELL

51:23.933 --> 51:24.966
LEXA VOSS, WHO TEACHES

51:25.033 --> 51:25.866
SHEEP-CUDDLING SEMINARS ON HER

51:25.933 --> 51:27.233
FARM, IT ALL MIGHT SEEM MORE

51:27.300 --> 51:28.266
APPEALING IF THIS SHEEP DIDN'T

51:28.333 --> 51:29.766
HAVE A LOOK ON HER FACE THAT

51:29.833 --> 51:31.333
SAYS "OH BOY, I KNOW WHERE THIS

51:31.400 --> 51:38.600
IS HEADED."

51:38.666 --> 51:38.866
[LAUGHTER]

51:38.933 --> 51:40.300
[APPLAUSE]

51:40.366 --> 51:41.900
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

51:41.966 --> 51:43.366
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE WOKE

51:43.433 --> 51:44.300
PHILOSOPHY OF "EQUALITY OF

51:44.366 --> 51:45.766
OUTCOMES," THEN YOU REALLY

51:45.833 --> 51:46.633
SHOULDN'T HAVE WATCHED THE

51:46.700 --> 51:50.300
GRAMMYS LAST SUNDAY.

51:50.366 --> 51:50.933
BECAUSE THE GRAMMYS, ASIDE FROM

51:51.000 --> 51:52.166
THE USUAL AWARD SHOW VIRTUE

51:52.233 --> 51:53.833
SIGNALING, ARE STILL LARGELY

51:53.900 --> 51:55.633
ABOUT THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN

51:55.700 --> 51:56.966
PEOPLE DO MUSIC BETTER THAN

51:57.033 --> 51:58.133
OTHERS, AND IT'S OKAY TO REWARD

51:58.200 --> 52:00.500
THEM FOR IT.

52:00.566 --> 52:02.533
THAT'S CALLED MERITOCRACY - AND

52:02.600 --> 52:03.500
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF GUARANTEED

52:03.566 --> 52:04.800
OUTCOMES.

52:04.866 --> 52:11.400
EQUALITY OF OUTCOMES?

52:11.466 --> 52:13.866
AS OPPOSED TO EQUALITY OF

52:13.933 --> 52:15.000
OPPORTUNITY?

52:15.066 --> 52:16.166
WE USED TO CALL THAT BY ANOTHER

52:16.233 --> 52:19.300
NAME: TROPHY SYNDROME.

52:19.366 --> 52:19.633
[APPLAUSE]

52:19.700 --> 52:20.900
A WORLD THAT WAS CREATED BACK IN

52:20.966 --> 52:21.933
THE '90S WHERE EVERY KID GETS A

52:22.000 --> 52:23.333
TROPHY, NO MATTER HOW GOOD OR

52:23.400 --> 52:25.900
BAD THEY ARE AT SOMETHING.

52:25.966 --> 52:27.666
WELL, THE RESULT OF THAT KIND OF

52:27.733 --> 52:29.833
THINKING IS THAT AMERICAN KIDS

52:29.900 --> 52:31.066
HAVE A TOTALLY DELUDED AND

52:31.133 --> 52:31.966
UNEARNED BELIEF IN THEIR CHARM,

52:32.033 --> 52:38.500
BRAINS AND TALENT.

52:38.566 --> 52:41.000
[APPLAUSE]

52:41.066 --> 52:43.300
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT THE ENTIRE

52:43.366 --> 52:43.900
GENERATION WANTS TO BE FAMOUS,

52:43.966 --> 52:44.500
IT'S THAT THEY THINK NOT BEING

52:44.566 --> 52:48.566
FAMOUS ISN'T FAIR.

52:48.633 --> 52:48.833
[LAUGHTER]

52:48.900 --> 52:51.400
IF YOU THINK I'M EXAGGERATING,

52:51.466 --> 52:52.233
LET ME QUOTE FROM THIS ARTICLE

52:52.300 --> 52:54.033
IN ROLLING STONE LAST YEAR

52:54.100 --> 52:56.466
LAMENTING HOW STREAMING HAS NOT

52:56.533 --> 52:59.333
GIVEN US EQUALITY OF OUTCOMES IN

52:59.400 --> 52:59.766
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

52:59.833 --> 53:00.866
OH, THE GRAMMYS WOULD LOOK QUITE

53:00.933 --> 53:03.666
DIFFERENT IF WE FOLLOWED THIS

53:03.733 --> 53:04.933
TEMPLATE: THE ARTICLE TELLS US

53:05.000 --> 53:08.433
THAT MORE THAN 1.6 MILLION

53:08.500 --> 53:13.000
ARTISTS RELEASED SONGS BETWEEN

53:13.066 --> 53:16.666
JANUARY 2019 AND JULY 2020 -

53:16.733 --> 53:19.200
40,000 TRACKS A DAY ON SPOTIFY -

53:19.266 --> 53:20.966
AND YET, ROLLING STONE COMPLAINS

53:21.033 --> 53:22.766
"TODAY'S STREAMING LANDSCAPE

53:22.833 --> 53:24.166
LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE MUSIC

53:24.233 --> 53:25.600
INDUSTRY USED TO.

53:25.666 --> 53:27.666
A SMALL CLASS OF ARTISTS.

53:27.733 --> 53:29.033
SEE NOT JUST THE MAJORITY OF

53:29.100 --> 53:29.866
ACTIVITY, BUT DAMN NEAR ALL OF

53:29.933 --> 53:31.633
IT."

53:31.700 --> 53:33.300
YES, THESE ARE CALLED THE GOOD

53:33.366 --> 53:41.900
ONES.

53:41.966 --> 53:43.466
[LAUGHTER]

53:43.533 --> 53:43.933
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

53:44.000 --> 53:45.433
OF COURSE, AN OCCASIONAL BIG

53:45.500 --> 53:46.633
TALENT CAN FALL THROUGH THE

53:46.700 --> 53:47.633
CRACKS, BUT IN GENERAL, IT'S

53:47.700 --> 53:49.666
SIMPLY A CASE THAT MOST PEOPLE

53:49.733 --> 53:50.866
WHO TRY THEIR HAND AT MUSIC

53:50.933 --> 53:52.433
WRITE THE SONGS THAT DON'T MAKE

53:52.500 --> 53:58.033
THE WHOLE WORLD SING.

53:58.100 --> 53:58.300
[LAUGHTER]

53:58.366 --> 53:59.500
ROLLING STONE COMPLAINS THAT

53:59.566 --> 54:00.533
"NEARLY ALL THE STREAMS WENT TO

54:00.600 --> 54:02.200
ARTISTS IN THE TOP TEN PERCENT

54:02.266 --> 54:04.933
WITH THE BOTTOM 90% PULLING IN

54:05.000 --> 54:07.266
JUST .6% OF STREAMS."

54:07.333 --> 54:08.866
WHOA, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT -

54:08.933 --> 54:10.933
TALENTED ARTISTS PEOPLE LIKE ARE

54:11.000 --> 54:12.633
LISTENED TO MORE THAN UNTALENTED

54:12.700 --> 54:19.200
ONES THAT THEY DON'T?

54:19.266 --> 54:21.766
[LAUGHTER]

54:21.833 --> 54:23.600
STOP THE PRESSES.

54:23.666 --> 54:24.300
YES, MERITOCRACY!

54:24.366 --> 54:25.700
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOUR SONG,

54:25.766 --> 54:27.266
YOUR MOMMY CAN'T MAKE THEM

54:27.333 --> 54:32.533
LISTEN TO IT.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.633
[LAUGHTER]

54:34.700 --> 54:36.033
YOU KNOW WHY 99% OF ARTISTS

54:36.100 --> 54:38.133
AREN'T GETTING HEARD?

54:38.200 --> 54:39.466
BECAUSE MUSIC IS HARD AND MOST

54:39.533 --> 54:42.066
PEOPLE SUCK AT IT.

54:42.133 --> 54:43.433
FOR MORE DETAILS, GOOGLE

54:43.500 --> 54:46.100
"REALITY."

54:46.166 --> 54:48.166
ROLLING STONE ACTUALLY WRITES

54:48.233 --> 54:50.333
THE SENTENCE "IN A PERFECT

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
WORLD, THE BOTTOM ONE PERCENT OF

54:51.466 --> 54:52.933
ARTISTS WOULD GET ONE PERCENT OF

54:53.000 --> 54:55.233
ACTIVITY."

54:55.300 --> 54:56.633
NO, THEY WOULDN'T, THAT'S A

54:56.700 --> 54:57.700
STUPID WORLD I DON'T WANT TO

54:57.766 --> 54:59.500
LIVE IN - WHO TAUGHT YOU THIS

54:59.566 --> 55:01.200
NONSENSE?

55:01.266 --> 55:02.800
AND WHEN YOU WHINE THAT

55:02.866 --> 55:04.000
"STREAMING HASN'T JUST UPHELD

55:04.066 --> 55:05.966
THE GAP BETWEEN MUSIC'S HAVES

55:06.033 --> 55:08.433
AND HAVE-NOTS, IT'S WIDENED IT,"

55:08.500 --> 55:09.800
YOU'RE MAKING MY CASE FOR ME,

55:09.866 --> 55:11.033
BECAUSE STREAMING ALLOWS THE

55:11.100 --> 55:12.666
PUBLIC TO SAMPLE EVERYBODY -

55:12.733 --> 55:15.033
THERE'S NO MORE GATEKEEPERS, YOU

55:15.100 --> 55:15.833
CAN'T COMPLAIN NO ONE HEARD YOUR

55:15.900 --> 55:17.566
SONG BECAUSE NO LABEL WOULD SIGN

55:17.633 --> 55:18.400
YOU.

55:18.466 --> 55:20.800
WE TORE THAT WALL DOWN, AND THE

55:20.866 --> 55:22.366
RESULT WAS THE SAME: SOME

55:22.433 --> 55:24.466
MUSICIANS ARE HAVE NOTS BECAUSE,

55:24.533 --> 55:25.866
YES, THEY MAY HAVE A VOICE, BUT

55:25.933 --> 55:37.266
WE HAVE EARS.

[LAUGHTER]

55:37.766 --> 55:38.000
[APPLAUSE]

55:38.066 --> 55:39.000
IT REMINDS ME OF THE EARLY

55:39.066 --> 55:40.300
AUDITION ROUNDS OF THE OLD

55:40.366 --> 55:41.866
AMERICAN IDOL WHERE CONTESTANTS

55:41.933 --> 55:43.966
ARE ALL ATTITUDE AND IMAGE, AS

55:44.033 --> 55:45.733
IF TO SAY, "CAN WE NOT FOCUS SO

55:45.800 --> 55:48.600
MUCH ON THE TALENT AND JUST SKIP

55:48.666 --> 55:53.066
TO THE PART WHERE I'M AN IDOL?"

55:53.133 --> 55:55.833
72% OF GEN Z SAY THEY'D LIKE TO

55:55.900 --> 55:59.200
BE AN ONLINE CELEBRITY, AND 54%

55:59.266 --> 56:00.066
OF GEN Z AND MILLENNIALS SAY

56:00.133 --> 56:01.433
THEY WOULD BECOME AN INFLUENCER

56:01.500 --> 56:11.766
"GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY."

56:12.400 --> 56:13.300
YOU KNOW, IF IT WASN'T TOO MUCH

56:13.366 --> 56:17.266
WORK, LIKE MAKING A SEX TAPE.

56:17.333 --> 56:21.733
SPEAKING OF WHICH PARIS HILTON

56:21.800 --> 56:27.433
JUST MADE A RETURN TO THE

56:27.500 --> 56:27.700
[LAUGHTER]

56:27.766 --> 56:28.666
JUST MADE A RETURN TO THE

56:29.733 --> 56:30.333
DITZY PARTY GIRL WE KNEW BACK IN

56:30.400 --> 56:32.100
THE DAY WAS JUST HER PLAYING "A

56:32.166 --> 56:33.833
CHARACTER," AND THAT THERE WAS

56:33.900 --> 56:35.066
REALLY MORE TO HER THAN SEX

56:35.133 --> 56:36.100
TAPES DRIVING DRUNK CARRYING

56:36.166 --> 56:39.233
AROUND A LITTLE DOG AND SAYING

56:39.300 --> 56:40.433
"THAT'S HOT."

56:40.500 --> 56:41.800
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT HER WORK ON

56:41.866 --> 56:47.433
THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT?

56:47.500 --> 56:47.700
[LAUGHTER]

56:47.766 --> 56:48.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?

56:48.500 --> 56:49.733
ANY JOKES I DID ABOUT PARIS - I

56:49.800 --> 56:50.666
DON'T FEEL BAD.

56:50.733 --> 56:52.233
SORRY, NOT SORRY.

56:52.300 --> 56:55.266
I JUST CAN'T - I CAN'T BE LIVING

56:55.333 --> 56:56.200
IN THIS TIME WHEN WE'RE MADLY ON

56:56.266 --> 56:57.700
THE HUNT FOR ANYTHING WITH THE

56:57.766 --> 57:04.066
SLIGHTEST WHIFF OF WHITE

57:04.133 --> 57:05.733
PRIVILEGE AND THEN FEEL BAD FOR

57:05.800 --> 57:06.566
PARIS HILTON.

57:06.633 --> 57:07.733
QUITE THE REVERSE, MAYBE PARIS

57:07.800 --> 57:14.800
IS THE ONE WHO OWES US AN

57:22.466 --> 57:23.566
FAMOUS-FOR NOTHING CULTURE.

57:23.633 --> 57:25.066
SHE KIND OF BIRTHED THE WORLD

57:25.133 --> 57:26.466
WHERE EVERY 15-YEAR-OLD WITH A

57:26.533 --> 57:27.500
PHONE ASPIRES TO BE AN

57:27.566 --> 57:29.433

57:29.500 --> 57:30.866

HOUSEWIVES AND TEEN MOMS AND

57:50.500 --> 57:52.400
AND SNARKY

57:52.466 --> 57:53.100
A GENERATION

57:53.166 --> 57:53.800

57:53.866 --> 57:55.033
THE "ROLE MODELS" WHO MANAGED TO

TURN AN UNENTHUSIASTIC BLOWJOB

57:55.766 --> 58:04.900
INTO AN EMPIRE.

YOUNG PEOPLE WHO THINK, "TALENT?

58:06.266 --> 58:07.233
MY TALENT IS BEING ME, AND YOU
