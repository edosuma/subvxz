00:10.177 --> 00:12.471
‐New song for Gigi?
‐Nope. You.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.431
I think it's gonna be like
a big, dramatic rocker.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.891
Like a lot of emotional drive.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.518
It could be a great showcase
tune for you.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.186
Oh, cool.
I need one of those.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.729

Micki maracas and where
is my lyrics notebook? Oh.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.859
You know, we, uh,
we could work on

00:25.859 --> 00:27.527
this tune together
right now, honey.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.446
Oh, but I am this close
to finishing

00:29.446 --> 00:32.157
a new tune that Flash and me
came up with.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.534
It's a blues ballad.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.619
He's got a bridge idea
last night

00:35.619 --> 00:37.329
that I am dying to listen to.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.206
Mm‐hmm.
(thunder rumbles)

00:39.206 --> 00:41.416
Oh, awesome.
And he's got a beat

00:41.416 --> 00:44.836
on the second verse.
Okay, I gotta go.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.547
So you have a customized
sound effect

00:46.547 --> 00:48.507
for when Flash texts you,
huh?

00:48.507 --> 00:51.468
Oh, we're going back and forth
with so many ideas these days

00:51.468 --> 00:53.053

thunder and lightning

00:53.053 --> 00:54.763

Long story.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.234
So I had some ideas too.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.653
I was thinking
in this B section

01:51.653 --> 01:54.156
that if we just change

This is the shit

02:40.827 --> 02:42.871
Oh, it's‐‐it's over.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.416
Right? I mean, we‐‐
we lucked out actually.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.168
Stumbled upon the perfect
little ending

02:48.168 --> 02:49.544
we should have had
25 years ago

02:49.544 --> 02:51.463
and nobody had to get hurt.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.758
Nobody got hurt.
Closure. It's nice now.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.052
Yeah.
What we had was great,

02:57.052 --> 02:59.054
but I am with Johnny.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.514
I'm with Gigi.

I gonna take Johnny out to
dinner tonight after rehearsal.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.313

03:08.313 --> 03:12.067
See? We're with the people
that we were meant to be with.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.486
We are with the people
we're meant to be with.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.530
And you and I,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
we're good now, right?

03:18.490 --> 03:20.492
Yeah.
We're good.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.674
Hey, what's with that property
out in New Jersey

03:35.674 --> 03:38.385
Gigi was telling me about?

03:38.385 --> 03:41.221
‐Oh, it's nice.
‐Yeah?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.140
It's right up your alley.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.933
Can I see it?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.310
Sure.

‐You gotta be shitting me.
‐It's great, right?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.481
And you can tell it's gonna be
a classy event

03:51.481 --> 03:53.108
because they didn't skimp
on the tee.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.068
This is really tender cotton.
You want to feel it?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.653
No, I don't want to feel it.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.447
She had no permission
to record the song, Noah.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.301
She did a couple
of interviews with local press

04:19.301 --> 04:21.761
and she mentioned your name
as a co‐writer.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.221
Okay, co‐writer?
What did she come up with,

04:23.221 --> 04:24.765
like, two lines
for that song?

04:24.765 --> 04:25.932
On a song that you didn't
want anybody to hear.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.350
A funny song.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.895
I wrote almost all
of a funny song, okay?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.730
God.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.273
Well, it's not that funny
anymore, man.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.066
It's a huge deal in Jersey.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.735
It's a major outdoor concert

04:36.735 --> 04:38.653
with Southside Johnny
and the Asbury Jukes,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.071
Blues Traveler,
and Jon Bon Jovi.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.615
Oh, Jon Bon Jovi.
Ooh.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.450
It's to cure a disease, Dad.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.118
Okay, it's not like
it's cancer, for Christ's sake.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.120
All right?
They can't eat hot dogs,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.330
they can't eat ice cream, and
they can't go out in the sun.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.664
They're better off.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.958
They'll probably outlive
all of us.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.919
Will you stop
touching the shirt?

04:53.919 --> 04:58.131
It's not just that it's soft,
it smells really good too.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.549
It's not the shirt.
It's you.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.926
You smell very good.
You smell better than I do.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.302
You know what it is?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.720
It's a new fragrance
that my wife got me.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.472
It's called Pure Lavender
by Azzaro.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.140
I totally forgot
that I was wearing it.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.059
You know what's great?
My career's in the hands

05:09.059 --> 05:10.393
of Heidi Klum, okay?
Heidi.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.895
You need to put a stop
to the song.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.480
I can't, dude.
It can't be stopped.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.106
It's a train
that is leaving the station.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.608
Please, can you just
jump on the train?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.693
Ah, not getting on the train.
Not doing it.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.612
They want us to sing
on the record today

05:20.612 --> 05:22.322
with Tanika, Little Steven,
and Southside Johnny.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.157
Oh, great,
a glorified bar band

05:24.157 --> 05:25.784
and a pirate from Paramus.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.619
Not a chance.
I'm not doing it.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.871
It doesn't matter if you think
the song sucks, Dad.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.582
20,000 music fans think
the song is great and touching.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.959
And memorable.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.669
Plus I'm getting
great feedback on it.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.629
I got a call today
from the Parkinson's people.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.381

05:42.676 --> 05:45.220
And hear me out,
I also got some calls

05:45.220 --> 05:46.513
from some ad exec friends
of mine that I know...

05:46.513 --> 05:48.265
‐No.
‐And they want to offer you

05:48.265 --> 05:49.474
some jingle writing jobs.
Please.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.809
Dude, I'm never writing
jingles.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.018
‐Why not?
‐Because I'm a real

05:52.018 --> 05:53.645
goddamn songwriter.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.647
I'm not some Madison Avenue
hack jingle writing bitch.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.400
Oh, my God. There are real
goddamn songwriters

05:58.400 --> 06:00.151
all over TV right now,

06:00.151 --> 06:01.862
including, by the way,
some of your heroes.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.572
Yeah, that's right.
Iggy Pop is selling Audis‐‐

06:03.572 --> 06:05.240
That's different.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.658
"Should I Stay Or Should I Go
Now" is the theme song

06:06.658 --> 06:08.493
‐for Comfort Inns.
‐Completely different.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.954
Dude, the Rolling Stones sold
"Satisfaction" to Hilton Hotels.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.706
Because they're
the Rolling Stones.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.583
Right, that's the point.
They're all doing it.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.167
They're all doing it.
They're taking their catalogs

06:16.167 --> 06:17.878
and they're turning that
into a whole bunch of money.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.379
Except the problem is
you don't have a catalog.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.089
Yeah, and you don't
have money either

06:21.089 --> 06:22.883
because the 200 grand that
my mom gave me to move out here,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.301
between the band stuff
and the rent,

06:24.301 --> 06:28.096
‐I'm down to, like, 50,000.
‐Really?

06:28.096 --> 06:31.349

Listen, everything you guys
are saying

makes complete and total sense,
but it's never gonna happen.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.772
Because there's two people
in rock and roll

06:37.772 --> 06:41.276
who will never sell their souls:
The Boss and <i>moi.</i>

What the‐‐

08:55.410 --> 08:58.079
‐What does that say?
‐It says additional material

08:58.079 --> 09:00.915
supplied by you.

09:00.915 --> 09:04.502
That's a very important
box office info block too.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.964
Because everybody who, you know,
wants to buy tickets, that's‐‐

09:07.964 --> 09:10.383
they read that first.
Right, Spence?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.968
‐Totally.
‐Yeah, it's very important.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.513
Hey, this is happening,
you guys, right?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.015
Oh, look at the time.
Right.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.184
Do me a favor,
just initial the back of this,

09:19.184 --> 09:20.518
and then we can get these
into print, okay?

09:20.518 --> 09:21.561
‐All right, buddy.
‐Cool.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.562
Thanks, Spence.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.360
‐Wow.
‐Yeah?

09:29.360 --> 09:32.655
(chuckles)
Yeah.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.365
It's silly I'll probably never
even live here.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.202
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.497
I'm seeing the main house
goes right here

09:40.497 --> 09:42.665
where we're standing,
okay?

09:42.665 --> 09:46.252
And then you gotta have a stable
over there in that corner.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.629
Think it's big enough
for a horse?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.214
Oh, yeah.
At least four of 'em.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.174
Maybe more because you're gonna
have party guests.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.926
‐Yeah.
‐Yes.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.386
And you're gonna need
an outdoor entertaining area

09:55.386 --> 09:57.847
right over there
centered around a fire pit

09:57.847 --> 10:00.225
that also doubles
as a barbecue pit.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.644
‐I like it.
‐Yes.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.104
And then a barn over there.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.730
I like that too.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.528
Something is coming to me.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.279
A wrought iron chandelier

10:13.279 --> 10:15.865
over a big‐ass redwood
slab table.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.285
‐Oh, we're doing decor now?
‐Rustic, but not too rustic.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.912
Rustic chic.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
I call it
sophisticated cowboy.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.541
What about some antlers?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.709
Antlers,
but check this.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.628
They're guitar holders.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.713
Old‐timey saloon piano.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.382
Reclaimed wood bar stools.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.218
Funky vintage candelabra.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.887
Whiskey barrels
full of flowers.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.515
One of those old pumps
that's actually a beer tap.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.142
Chesterfield sofa.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.643
Chesterfield daybed.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.270
Navajo rocks.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.606
Navajo shit everywhere.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.983
Roaring fire.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.235
God damn.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.821
God damn.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.781
Yeah.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.741
Yeah.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.495
"Additional material
supplied by."

11:02.495 --> 11:04.581
‐Okay, listen.
‐Additional materials.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.416
I came up with
the original idea.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.709
That's not really
"additional."

11:07.709 --> 11:09.627
That's sort of
"original materials."

11:09.627 --> 11:11.337
‐Listen.
‐What?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.089
‐They wrote new songs, okay?
‐I know.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.674
They wrote all new
story points.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.094
‐I heard what they‐‐
‐It's a whole new show.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.722
Babe, "additional material
supplied by"

11:20.722 --> 11:22.557
sounds like I work
at Home Depot!

11:22.557 --> 11:24.350
I want to take that poster,
roll it up,

11:24.350 --> 11:25.810
and I want to smoke it.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.729
Who gives a crap
about the poster?

11:27.729 --> 11:30.481
Nobody reads the credits
on a show poster.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.984
Oh, really?
Okay, then do me a favor...

11:32.984 --> 11:34.444
‐Yeah.
‐And just switch credits

11:34.444 --> 11:36.112
‐with me.
‐Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.364
Exactly!
Spence?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.908
‐What?
‐Come here for a second.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.451
A second, I'll be right back
with you, okay?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.161
What do you want?
What's up?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.954
‐What is this bullshit, Spence?
‐What?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.624
Where's my credit?
I told‐‐I created this thing.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.791
I want to have the same credit

11:48.791 --> 11:50.043
as the composer has
on the thing.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.461
I want the same size,
the same placement‐‐

11:51.461 --> 11:53.338
No, no, no, absolutely not.
Hell, no.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.215
We're not doing that.
It's never gonna happen, okay?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.842
Look, you know why?
Because that guy wrote 15 songs

11:57.842 --> 11:59.260
all by himself.
And what did you do?

11:59.260 --> 12:01.012
You wrote parts of three.
Three songs.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.430
‐Look‐‐
‐You know what?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.057
We're not even
contractually obligated

12:04.057 --> 12:07.560
to give you anything bigger.
I'm sorry.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.020
You know what?
This is just reality, sonny.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.396
‐Forget it.
‐Hey, Spence.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:18.029 --> 12:21.032
(laughing)

12:21.032 --> 12:23.826
‐Is he (...) with me?
‐I'm (...) with you.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.371
I'm so glad to be involved
in this, are you kidding?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.997
I love it so much.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.375
I mean, look,
I realize I sold my soul,

12:30.375 --> 12:31.834
but I didn't sell my soul
to the devil.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.254
We got one of the great actors
on the American stage.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.048
I mean, Campbell Scott,
he's the son of George C. Scott.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.216
I mean,
if we were in England,

12:38.216 --> 12:39.884
he would have been knighted
by now.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.262
Dude, I bask
in his glorious light.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.514
Mm‐hmm.
Okay, so, can we print now?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.349
Are we cool with that?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.142
Go to print, baby.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.352
Okay, awesome.
Thank you.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.854
‐Babe‐‐
‐I love that poster!

12:51.854 --> 12:54.774
(chuckles)

12:54.774 --> 12:57.151
‐What's going on?
‐What?

12:57.151 --> 12:59.195
Well, ten seconds ago
you were about to light

12:59.195 --> 13:01.364
the poster on fire
and flip out.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.074
And now you do a 180.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.326
What gives?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.204
I had a...revelation.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.456
Oh, your Xanax kicked in?

13:10.456 --> 13:15.044
Well, the two are not
mutually exclusive,

13:15.044 --> 13:17.088
so...

13:26.639 --> 13:30.226
(sighs)

13:30.226 --> 13:32.812
‐We're gonna have to tell them.
‐I know.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.064
I'm not looking forward
to that.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.317
‐You want me to do it?
‐Yes.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.278
‐All by myself?
‐No. I'll be there.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.155
Totally supporting you
all the way.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.573
But what?
You're not gonna say nothing?

13:43.573 --> 13:45.366
You just said
you were gonna tell them.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.410
I know, but I thought
you'd say, "No, I'll tell them,"

13:47.410 --> 13:48.828
'cause I was just being
chivalrous.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.163
(chuckles)

13:50.163 --> 13:51.831
Oh, that's what I love
about you.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.751
Such a strong cowboy.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.836
I think this blanket would
look nice in the new house.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.173
Mm, I was just thinking
the same thing.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.091
Only maybe not this blanket.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.844
No, this is officially
an outdoor blanket.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.180
(chuckles)

14:07.180 --> 14:09.599

14:09.599 --> 14:14.687

14:14.687 --> 14:18.566

14:18.566 --> 14:20.485
Hey, what's up?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.945
Dad, you need to get down
to Reservoir Studios now.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.239
GIGI: Bruce Springsteen is here.
‐He is?

14:25.239 --> 14:27.158
Yes, he's recording his
background vocals for the song.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.868
He totally digs the tune,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.495
and he wants to meet
Tanika's songwriting partner.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.622
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.248
He's so nice,
and he's so cute.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.292
GIGI: He looks half his age,
and he smells awesome.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.752
Right.
What does he smell like?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.045
He smells musky.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.506
Like a musky,
muscular lumberjack.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.382
‐So dreamy.
‐Okay, okay.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.759
Wait, wait, wait,
one more thing.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.803
‐What?
JOHNNY: Um,

14:46.803 --> 14:49.639
what should I wear?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.390

14:51.390 --> 14:52.725

JOHNNY: Hey.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.689
What took you so long?

15:39.689 --> 15:42.233
Traffic sucked.
So is he here?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.568
Yeah, he's almost done.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.944
Where is he?
Down there?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.112
‐Is Patti here?
‐What do you smell like?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.738
‐You smell like Noah.
‐Huh?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.323
You smell like‐‐
are you wearing Ava's perfume?

15:49.323 --> 15:50.950
Oh, my God.
Is it that obvious?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.577
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.203
‐It's fine. Just sit down.
‐Ah, Jesus.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.955
No, I don't want to sit down.
I'm too nervous.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.623
I can't believe it.
I'm gonna finally meet Bruce

15:57.623 --> 15:59.417
and I smell like Beyoncé.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.460
Okay, so smoke a cigarette
to get rid of the dainty smell.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.087
‐I smell dainty?
‐A little bit.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.630
(exhales sharply)
No, I don't want to smoke.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.507
Because I heard that
he hates people that smoke.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.302
What's he like? Is he nice?
Is he cool? How tall is he?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.012
Why did you bring
your guitar?

16:11.012 --> 16:13.347
Oh, because I remembered
that I wrote this song years ago

16:13.347 --> 16:15.057
‐with him in mind, right?
‐Uh‐‐huh.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.475
And I was gonna bring
the demo, then I'm like,

16:16.475 --> 16:18.311
"No, the demo's, like,
20 years old,"

16:18.311 --> 16:19.770
but if I play the song live,
he'll get the full live effect.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.189
It'll only take a few minutes.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.440
It's called
"West To West Orange."

16:22.440 --> 16:23.733
‐It won't take that long.
‐Okay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.359
‐He's gonna dig it.
‐Yeah.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.445
Is it about a working class guy
and his muscle car

16:27.445 --> 16:29.655
and the girl he wants to rescue
from the shitty New Jersey town

16:29.655 --> 16:32.074
‐they both were born in?
‐It has other layers to it.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.075
‐I'm sure it does.
‐Yeah.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.702
What's in the bag?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.245
Well, he likes to sign stuff.
I heard about that.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.788
So like, I just thought
I'd bring some albums

16:37.788 --> 16:39.624
and a couple of cassettes
and a box set

16:39.624 --> 16:42.418
and two books and one hat.
Nothing, you know.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.170
‐Yeah.
‐How's my hair?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.421
Is it hot in here?

16:45.421 --> 16:47.798
'Cause it really feels hot.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.717
‐(exhales sharply)
‐Oh, my God.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.177
‐What?
‐You sound like me

16:51.177 --> 16:52.803
when I thought
I was gonna meet Gaga.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.597
I was all freaked out
about my hair and my outfit.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.598
And I thought
I was gonna faint.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.142
It's Bruce.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.186
What?
Does my stuff not look good?

17:00.186 --> 17:03.105
I picked this out for him.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.359
He is not here.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.319
What do you mean? Is he
getting coffee or something?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.905
No. I needed to make sure
that you came here

17:10.905 --> 17:12.406
to sing with Tanika
on the track

17:12.406 --> 17:13.658
and to take pictures
and do the interview

17:13.658 --> 17:15.159
for the "Newark Star‐Ledger"
article.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.869
And I need you to start acting
like an adult

17:16.869 --> 17:19.121
in this little father/daughter
thing we got going on.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.040
‐Can you do that for me?
‐Yes.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.042
Okay.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.752
So he's not here?
I'm not meeting him.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.129
‐Definitely not.
‐Great.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.883
(sighs)

17:30.883 --> 17:32.260
Southside Johnny here?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.511
‐He's not.
‐Thank God.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.475
I really want to thank you.
I know you wanted to get

17:39.475 --> 17:41.269
that song finished for Ava
before today's rehearsal,

17:41.269 --> 17:43.229
but you really did me a solid,
even if it was under duress.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.689
‐It was cool of you.
‐I know. You were right.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.274
And you know what?
I have a first verse

17:46.274 --> 17:48.234
and I have the chorus,
so she's gonna get the idea,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.611
you know?
Ahem.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.949
Hey.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.661
(clears throat)

17:58.661 --> 18:01.747
What's going on?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.040
We gotta talk, brother.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.878
Where's your gear
and all your guitars?

18:07.878 --> 18:10.548
No offense, Johnny,
but you can get violent

18:10.548 --> 18:12.758
in emotionally charged
situations.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.885
(scoffs)

18:14.885 --> 18:16.304
You guys
are leaving the band.

18:16.304 --> 18:20.182
Well, let's hope not.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.853
‐John?
‐Yeah?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.771
‐Gigi?
‐Yes?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.648
Um,

18:27.648 --> 18:31.485
Flash and Ava
have discovered a, um,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.487
a nascent desire

18:33.487 --> 18:36.490
that has blossomed into

18:36.490 --> 18:40.494
a living, breathing,
uh, love

18:40.494 --> 18:44.999
for each other.

18:44.999 --> 18:48.252
Now, John,
it is not your fault.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.797
Gigi, it's not your fault
either.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.884
And it's not Ava
and Flash's fault.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.886
It's, uh, well,

18:56.886 --> 19:01.641
it's a natural, organic love.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.436
And it's‐‐it's real.
It's here.

19:05.436 --> 19:09.231
And it's‐‐
it's all around us.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.817
Feel it?

19:11.817 --> 19:16.364
Now, John,
I know that, uh,

19:16.364 --> 19:18.783
it's perfectly natural
for you to be angry

19:18.783 --> 19:22.119
and wish to express your anger
through confrontation

19:22.119 --> 19:23.621
and physical means.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.415
‐(scoffs)
‐I'm hoping to diffuse

19:26.415 --> 19:27.667
that desire

19:27.667 --> 19:30.294
and help you understand

19:30.294 --> 19:33.005
how strong,

19:33.005 --> 19:37.802
how powerful and possibly
permanent the‐‐the feelings

19:37.802 --> 19:40.054
between these two...

19:40.054 --> 19:43.724
rays of love are.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.852
And to fight to keep
this family,

19:46.852 --> 19:51.315
this band family together,
to find that greatness,

19:51.315 --> 19:55.319
that is still inside

19:55.319 --> 19:58.155
four very talented brains.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.124
You remember my eggs?

20:08.124 --> 20:10.209
I'm not doing
the goddamn eggs right now.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.837
It's okay, I got this.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.505
(chuckles)

20:14.505 --> 20:16.757
(inhales deeply)

20:16.757 --> 20:19.260
So here's what
we're gonna do.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.847
First of all, you're gonna
take off your glasses.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.607
Thanks.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.360
We're all gonna handle this
in a very professional manner.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.155
Like professional musicians.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.032
We are all gonna continue
to go to rehearsals.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.827
We're gonna give 110%
while doing so

20:44.827 --> 20:47.204
because this isn't
The Heathens.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
This is The Assassins,
Gigi's band,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.459
and I don't want any
of this personal stuff

20:51.459 --> 20:55.504
to get in the way
of where she's going.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.091
All right?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.844
How's that sound?
Good?

21:01.844 --> 21:05.306
Amazing.
Great.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.265
Understood?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.730
‐Okay.
‐Yeah.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.399
Great.
All right, honey.

21:15.399 --> 21:19.653
I need to go to your apartment
and pick up some of my stuff.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.697
‐Sure. When?
‐I'm gonna do that now.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.450
And I'll leave my key.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.701
Bye, guys.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.996
‐Thanks.
‐Thank you?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.881
I don't know.
Maybe she got to Johnny.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.300
‐Maybe he's grown up.
‐That girl has her eyes

21:41.300 --> 21:44.512
on the prize.
(gasps)

21:44.512 --> 21:47.515
Oh, my God.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.724

22:03.447 --> 22:05.783
Shit.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.036
‐Oh, my God.
‐Goddamn Johnny.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.496
Oh,

22:10.496 --> 22:13.332
I don't think
it was Johnny.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.417
Yeah, those aren't his lips.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.253
Those aren't his lips.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.672
Son of a bitch,
look at this.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.590
What?

22:21.590 --> 22:23.926
Oh.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.555
She left behind the one ax
that supports her vocals

22:27.555 --> 22:30.975
better than any other
in my arsenal.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.936
Like I said,
eyes on the prize.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.155
Where'd you get
a chainsaw?

22:45.155 --> 22:47.283
Found it in one
of his closets.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.703
Probably bought it to start
using on his stupid farm.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.788
I hope you learned
a good lesson from all this.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.123
I did.

22:54.123 --> 22:57.418
Chainsaws are cool as shit.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.254
That's my girl.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.840
‐I'm in love...
‐Love this part.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.427
So very much in love, I feel
my chest will explode.
