00:03.568 --> 00:05.135
Previously, on "The Village"...

00:05.179 --> 00:06.832
Are you fine
with us just being friends?

00:06.876 --> 00:08.443
- Yes.
- Did he tell you the sex?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.706
- She's having a boy.
- Don't tell Katie.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.142
She asked not to know.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.970
But if what you want
is to cut me out,

00:14.014 --> 00:15.624
I'll give you that, too.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.863
Heard you found a new friend.
You invite her to our party?

00:17.887 --> 00:19.149
It feels like Rosemary's turf.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.151
I took this pro-bono thing.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.694
It's about a woman who might
be deported to Iran.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.850
It's about the little boy
she'd have to leave behind.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.417
I'm not asking you
to take the case,

00:26.461 --> 00:28.202
I'm just asking you to help me.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.987
I want to talk about Sami.
Your trial's in two weeks.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.704
I haven't decided
what I'll do if I'm deported.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.947
Of all the things you could
have said to keep me.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.993
I quit.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.345
If you're really
in love with us, or...

00:41.389 --> 00:44.174
does it just feels good
to have a family again?

00:44.218 --> 00:46.872
I'll be advising
we forgo further chemo

00:46.916 --> 00:49.136
and move forward
with a full hysterectomy.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.702
It was a drip that triggered me.

00:50.746 --> 00:53.401
The guy who I keep seeing
in these PTSD episodes?

00:53.444 --> 00:54.532
Rashad.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.099
He's not a soldier.
He's a fireman.

00:56.143 --> 00:59.102
I thought leaving Afghanistan
was causing my PTSD,

00:59.146 --> 01:01.670
I think it's coming back
to New York.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.150
9/11?

01:10.505 --> 01:12.594
- Six benches.
- What about them?

01:12.637 --> 01:14.161
Well, that's the finish line.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.008
Yeah, but you were just
getting used to this thing.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.425
- Go!
- Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.213 --> 02:07.518
My Gabie's first trial.

02:07.562 --> 02:11.305
This may be the most
important meal I ever make.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.308
We'll roll up our sleeves
together.

02:14.351 --> 02:17.398
I can't imagine the...
The pressure he's under.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.356
Sweet how worried you are
for him.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.967
And if Ava gets
deported today, what then?

02:22.011 --> 02:24.013
Aa boy needs his mother.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.233
We'll make enough for everyone.

02:26.276 --> 02:29.192
Sometimes a warm meal
is the best comfort there is.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.412
Rosemary's bolognese.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.805
I should have started the gravy
two days ago.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.508
Who bought the pig foot?

02:40.551 --> 02:42.597
I did.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.902
For the sauce.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.469
That's unnecessary.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.864
If by "unnecessary"
you mean "essential."

02:48.907 --> 02:51.823
That foot is not going
in my pot.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.912
Little friendly competition?

02:53.956 --> 02:56.480
Prepare to be destroyed.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.222
I look forward to consoling you.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.835
I don't know why we're packing.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.533
You're coming right back here.

03:05.576 --> 03:08.449
Hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.017
What about the dishes?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.845
Only what's most important.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.761
Shipping to Iran is expensive.

03:16.805 --> 03:20.983
Maybe whoever moves in next
would want the rest.

03:23.377 --> 03:27.207
If it comes to that,
I'll get you a good price.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.601
You will give it
to Hamid's parents for Sami?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
Of course.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.220
The Summer Olympics
are in Tokyo.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.352
I think you got a really
good shot with that thing.

03:42.396 --> 03:45.355
I don't even wear
the medals I've got.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.184
At some point, it's just stuff
you lug around with you.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.621
Yeah.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.276
How's life at the veteran hotel?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.539
Communal.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.541
Nice guys.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.935
Lot of people
still fighting their own war.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.503
Make any progress with yours?

04:02.546 --> 04:05.767
Well, at least I know
which one I'm fighting.

04:06.942 --> 04:09.901
That firefighter I kept seeing
is Rashad Cole.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.381
Different ladder company
than me.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.470
Any idea how you're connected?

04:13.514 --> 04:16.778
I got some calls out to guys
I knew from Ground Zero.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.259
Nobody remembers
where the hell I was that day.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.087
Yeah, somebody will.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.698
Somebody will.

04:23.741 --> 04:27.136
And then,
maybe you can let him go.

04:27.179 --> 04:30.182
One less dead hero
to carry with me.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.126
You're putting
too much pressure on yourself.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.586
It's my first trial,

04:42.630 --> 04:46.286
and this is Ava's one shot
to plead her case.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.984
And her defense is what it is.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.682
You think it'll be good enough?

04:52.814 --> 04:55.556
I think you should manage
your expectations.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.604
Is there a sink down here,
or...?

05:00.648 --> 05:02.258
Um...

05:02.302 --> 05:04.260
portable.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.783
I'm going up
to your grandfather's.

05:05.827 --> 05:09.047
You used to think I was fancy.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.184
My lawyer says
these adoption agreements

05:15.227 --> 05:16.751
are pretty boilerplate.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.841
If you don't mind, I might
have my neighbor take a look.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.625
He's in law school.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.932
Of course,
I just wanted you to see it

05:23.975 --> 05:27.152
before I gave it to Katie.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.286
Have you two talked at all?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.375
Not for 13 days.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
New record, yay.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.553
She'll come around.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.512
Well, I don't know.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.036
Once I left home...

05:41.079 --> 05:43.038
I was gone.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.607
I appreciate
you looking in on her.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.698
Anything you'd like me to say?

05:51.699 --> 05:54.397
I think it's best
you're neutral territory.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.928
I wanted to talk to you
about that page.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.672
Does Katie know?

06:08.716 --> 06:10.761
Not yet.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.039
Ava Behzadi, you have been
cordially invited

06:28.083 --> 06:29.780
to a pancake breakfast.

06:29.824 --> 06:30.955
Waffles.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.218
To a waffle breakfast
with your boys

06:33.262 --> 06:34.698
down on the corner.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.396
What do you say?
Old time's sake.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.355
You've packed him a bag
for his grandparents?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.879
He'll be all set if he needs it.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.534
Maybe you could take him
and bring something back.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.015
It will give me a chance to go
through the rest of his room.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.451
Yeah, of course.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.888
We'll be quick,
right, little man?

06:50.932 --> 06:53.891
Come on, start thinking
of toppings.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.971
The bill's paid,

07:30.014 --> 07:32.147
but the furnace
does go out occasionally.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.931
What do I do if that happens?

07:33.975 --> 07:35.648
Throw a brick in the oven,
stick it under your covers,

07:35.672 --> 07:37.108
and try not to move much.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.546
Or I could kill a grizzly,
climb inside.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.983
Yeah, as long as the neighbors

07:42.026 --> 07:43.245
don't see you wearing fur.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.507
They are very opposed.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.988
Okay, you win.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.122
I'm sorry, is this a tie?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.951
I'm not sure where
the Berlin gallery crowd stands

07:53.995 --> 07:55.344
on torn black tees.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.911
They want you.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.130
Be you.

08:01.437 --> 08:05.180
Now, I officially have 24 hours.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.442
What are we doing?

08:06.486 --> 08:10.315
Um, I signed up
for a childbirth class,

08:10.359 --> 08:12.317
and then Claire's coming over.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.928
That's not exactly
on my bucket list.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.104
No?
I'm pretty thrilled about it.

08:16.147 --> 08:20.543
Sidelong glances and sad smiles
from age-appropriate mothers

08:20.587 --> 08:22.371
make me feel awesome.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.547
Well, then, birth class it is.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.071
- What is?
- We is.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.856
Going.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.684
With my final hours,
we shall brave

08:30.727 --> 08:33.424
these sidelong glances
together, Katie Campbell.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.996
Your English seems excellent.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.322
You didn't know there were lies
in your paperwork?

08:41.346 --> 08:43.566
It's been 13 years,
and they weren't lies.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.395
Ithe letter said
I was protesting in Tehran,

08:46.438 --> 08:49.093
and that I received
death threats.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.269
That was true.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.359
We'll make that distinction.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.971
You don't want to look defiant.
I am defiant.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.842
Let us be defiant for you.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.149
Stick to the question.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.326
I didn't know English
when I arrived,

09:04.369 --> 09:08.286
but I took ESL classes
and volunteered in a preschool.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.811
The other women helped me learn.

09:10.854 --> 09:11.986
That's good.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.075
That establishes roots
in the community.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.033
All right.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.601
- Am I interrupting?
- No, we were just finishing.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.211
Well, we still have
several hours.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.562
And I'd like
to spend them with Sami.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.564
Of course.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.869
I'll see you in court.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.132
Wait, I...

09:28.176 --> 09:30.874
I have a little, small thank-you

09:30.918 --> 09:33.442
if we don't have
enough time after.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.314
It's to ward off evil spirits.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.883
You're my hero.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.407
You know that?

09:48.588 --> 09:52.287
If you make me cry,
I'm kicking you out.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.289
How's Katie?

09:55.595 --> 09:59.163
On a collision course
for heartbreak.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.470
And anything I say
will seem like

10:01.513 --> 10:04.255
a desperate and selfish attempt
to get her back,

10:04.299 --> 10:05.779
which I said I wouldn't do.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.824
What would you say if you could?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.086
I don't know.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.958
I don't think
I even speak her language.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.351
As I just discussed
with my lawyer,

10:13.395 --> 10:16.441
you can always learn it.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.708
Ava...

10:21.751 --> 10:23.623
this is so messed up.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.103
I broke the law.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.452
You made up for that.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.629
Maybe the judge will agree.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.545
I know you said you don't
want anyone at the hearing,

10:33.589 --> 10:36.853
but being there would make me
feel far less helpless.

10:39.073 --> 10:42.685
Consider it one last gift.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.253
If things don't go my way,

10:45.296 --> 10:47.777
I'd like to be remembered here,

10:47.821 --> 10:50.214
in a place I was your equal.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.870
You are my equal.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.788
My better.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.095
My boat-mate.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.967
What did I tell you?

11:04.011 --> 11:06.622
I'm a terrible listener.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.416
Little early for a garnish.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.767
Your taste buds
will beg to differ.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.865
That's a lot of wine.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.744
Maybe you can serve it
in a glass.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.887
Morning.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.672
Grab the secret bottle.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.196
Maybe you missed
the "morning" part.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.285
Desperate times.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.857
I know Ava's hearing is today.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.772
There something else?

12:11.774 --> 12:14.777
Patricia's
having surgery tomorrow.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.998
You think that means
"stop pouring"?

12:19.564 --> 12:23.133
It was decided a few weeks ago.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.963
She kept it to herself.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.792
Didn't wanna take away from Ava.

12:29.836 --> 12:30.924
But wasn't she supposed

12:30.967 --> 12:32.249
to have a few more rounds
of chemo?

12:32.273 --> 12:35.406
Her tumor's causing
complications.

12:35.450 --> 12:39.062
Once they start...

12:39.106 --> 12:41.064
I guess they don't stop.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.500
The problem is,

12:42.544 --> 12:46.026
her white blood cell count's
still low.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.942
That means they worry more
about an infection, right?

12:48.985 --> 12:51.727
Yeah, also means...

12:51.771 --> 12:54.295
she could bleed out
on the table.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.437
Hello?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.918
Yeah, this is Nick.
Sorry, who's this?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.749
No, no, no,
you got the right guy.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.621
Um, yeah,
I've been looking for you.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.365
If birth is
the everyday miracle,

13:21.409 --> 13:23.933
then you are
the miracle workers.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.587
Which is an apt name,

13:25.630 --> 13:28.198
because this miracle
actually takes some work.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.635
After today,
you'll know how to do it.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.247
So, let's start
by introducing ourselves.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.336
Hi. I'm Craig,

13:35.379 --> 13:37.817
this is my wife Randi,
who used to be my boss.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.645
Terrible employee,
excellent husband.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.083
We're having twins.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.736
Elle and Arthur.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.303
Congratulations.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.305
The rest of you
already have it easier

13:48.349 --> 13:49.654
than Craig and Randi.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.007
How about you guys?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.618
Um, Katie.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.838
And Liam.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.277
We met on Halloween.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.714
Tell them
what you were dressed as.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.847
Um...

14:09.065 --> 14:10.719
Aa pirate.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.330
And I, a cheap dockside harlot

14:13.374 --> 14:15.680
gone half-mad
with mercury poisoning.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.797
Now, I want you to gaze

14:45.841 --> 14:48.931
and accept your partner's gaze.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.411
I know it's uncomfortable,

14:50.454 --> 14:54.284
but the challenge is
to push past that.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.766
See where your partner holds
their beauty.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.902
- Very funny.
- Look down.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.037
See where your partner holds
their courage.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.347
Now smile.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.393
When you give birth,

15:16.437 --> 15:19.744
this person
is gonna be your rock.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.181
Your support.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.374
Don't be weird.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.811
- You're serious?
- Just do it.

15:42.854 --> 15:46.119
Okay, scoot all the way forward.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.251
Put your hands like this.

15:48.295 --> 15:51.167
There you go. And press.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.995
That is going to feel amazing

15:53.039 --> 15:56.085
when her hips are expanding
during labor.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.958
And hold that for as long
as you're comfortable.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.637
Most taggers do this at night.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.336
Yeah, well, my message
is kind of time sensitive.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.426
- "Yo"?
- There's still a lot left.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.664
Here's hoping you finish
before the owner

16:33.688 --> 16:35.429
of the building shows up.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.258
Yeah, thanks.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.393
You're the owner
of the building, aren't you?

16:50.183 --> 16:52.402
Look, I...
I don't normally do this.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.814
I'm trying to send a message
to my daughter.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.729
She's not talking to me,
and she's been living here

16:55.753 --> 16:58.800
with this guy, and I think
she's about to feel very alone.

17:03.413 --> 17:06.938
In that case,
we'd better finish up.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.202
You wanna help me
deface your property?

17:09.244 --> 17:11.508
I wanna ask for your number.

17:11.551 --> 17:12.901
Defacing my property
just gives me

17:12.944 --> 17:15.208
a clever way to earn it.

17:21.779 --> 17:26.175
So, one number for every letter
we paint together?

17:26.219 --> 17:28.263
I think you're gonna be
one number short.

17:28.308 --> 17:31.398
I'll add an exclamation point.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.897
- Both Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.682
I'm sorry your coffee's cold.

17:54.725 --> 17:58.077
And that your hands
have been dipped in blood.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.513
I was painting.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.602
New hobby?

18:01.645 --> 18:05.432
Desperate ploy
to subliminally comfort Katie.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.130
Mostly a reminder
I have no discernable talent.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.219
Come on.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.613
Is everything okay?

18:12.656 --> 18:16.791
Well, I got a call
from Rashad's daughter.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.140
She wants to meet.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.228
How'd she find you?

18:19.272 --> 18:21.012
I put out some feelers

18:21.056 --> 18:22.642
and assumed somebody
would get me a number,

18:22.666 --> 18:25.626
but didn't expect it
to go the other way around.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.150
What are you gonna do?

18:28.194 --> 18:30.631
I said I'd meet her.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.023
Here.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.986
I was kind of hoping
you could do it with me.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.509
Sure.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.297
Nick, of course.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.996
I hope you enjoyed your lunch.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.564
Okay, grab your seats.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.828
We are spending the final hour
on infant care.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.178
My friend Candace
brought her daughter Jill in

18:56.222 --> 18:59.225
to be our very cute guinea pig.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.577
We can go.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.753
Candace is one
of thousands of women

19:05.796 --> 19:07.929
for whom breast feeding
didn't come easy.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.235
Katie, are you sure?

19:09.278 --> 19:12.194
I don't need to know this part.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.024
Of course, I'm sorry.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.113
Katie, are you guys joining us?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.205
Looks like we'll be leaving.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
I have a touch

19:24.728 --> 19:27.470
of the old irritable bowel,
I'm afraid.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.429
I'm crowning as we speak.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.257
Ring of fire, indeed.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.612
Ms. Behzadi
is a taxpayer and mother

19:38.655 --> 19:41.397
whose career benefits
the children of Brooklyn.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.270
Whatever wrong was committed
without her knowledge,

19:44.313 --> 19:47.055
we have the opportunity here
to do what's right.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.449
- Deport her.
- Come on, that was great.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.625
I was unmoved.
It's too polished.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.453
You gotta speak
from the heart, Gabie.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.368
I thought it was beautiful.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.326
- Thank you.
- She's lucky to have you.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.936
She's buttering you up.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.375
- What is this?
- It's a power lunch.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.594
In one bowl
is your Nonna's bolognese,

20:04.638 --> 20:06.030
and in the other
is an abomination

20:06.074 --> 20:07.162
to our heritage.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.251
Your grandfather and I
are having a bit

20:09.295 --> 20:12.080
of a blind taste test.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.560
You are the judge.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.344
I don't think I'm that hungry.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.390
Sit down.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.059
Ava, I think we should
get going soon.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.891
Hamid, how you doing?

20:42.632 --> 20:43.957
Could you please
give us a moment?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.287
Of course.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.985
Sami-Joon, come show me
what you have packed.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.078
Didn't realize he was coming.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.732
He wants to accompany me
and Sami

20:55.776 --> 20:58.169
to Shirin and Abbas' home
before the hearing.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.606
What do you want?

20:59.649 --> 21:02.130
I think if the hearing
doesn't go my way

21:02.173 --> 21:04.959
he's the only parent Sami has.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.004
Well, he's got me.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.790
Ava, whatever happens,

21:09.833 --> 21:12.009
I wanna be with you.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.926
Across the world?

21:15.970 --> 21:17.319
You don't?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.366
I think we've been forced
to act like a couple

21:20.409 --> 21:23.020
that is so much further along.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.632
It's only been a few months.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.025
Which is long enough to know

21:28.069 --> 21:30.158
I'm not saying goodbye here.

21:30.201 --> 21:33.074
I wish you would.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.559
I'll see you in court.

21:46.174 --> 21:49.482
It's kind like I can
only remember bits and pieces.

21:49.525 --> 21:52.963
But, um, one of the pieces
was your dad...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.750
Asking me to tell you
that he loved you.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.276
Sorry the message took so long
to get here.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.366
No, no, it came
when I needed it.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.499
I wish I had more.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.283
You don't remember anything?

22:08.327 --> 22:11.504
No, not for lack of trying.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.681
Youyou pulled him
from the rubble

22:14.724 --> 22:16.683
and you dragged him
into the basement

22:16.726 --> 22:18.249
of this little souvenir shop

22:18.293 --> 22:20.643
right as the second tower
was coming down.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.387
How do you know that?

22:25.431 --> 22:28.172
The first responders
who found my dad told my mom.

22:28.216 --> 22:31.524
Said that he was covered in ash
and that he was laying

22:31.567 --> 22:35.049
in the arms
of another firefighter.

22:37.791 --> 22:41.011
My mom tried
to track you down for years

22:41.055 --> 22:43.362
and finally she decided that...

22:43.405 --> 22:45.078
there was a reason
why we couldn't find you.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.409
Well, I was in Afghanistan.

22:49.237 --> 22:52.240
She believed you were an angel.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.633
I'm not.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.638
You are to her.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.380
And I'd like to think
maybe he thought so too.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.950
Do you remember where
the souvenir shop was?

23:06.994 --> 23:09.039
Yeah, I do.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.874
Hello, Sami-Joon.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.660
I don't wanna go anywhere.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.708
My sweet boy.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.235
Can you keep a secret?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.770
He's nervous.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.294
He's focused.

23:46.337 --> 23:49.297
Enzo, he's gonna be great.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.474
You do realize
he was being polite?

23:52.518 --> 23:53.823
Here we go.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
You're the guest.
He had to pick yours.

23:55.695 --> 24:00.134
That would require him
to know which one was mine.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.050
Well, maybe he found
a piece of hoof.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.967
Are all Napolitano's
this graceless in defeat?

24:07.010 --> 24:10.100
If so, it's because
we don't have much practice.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.502
About to get started.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.852
Where is she?
Hamid didn't bring her?

24:22.896 --> 24:25.376
She told me
she was coming with you.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.513
Ava?

24:34.516 --> 24:36.344
Patricia.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.525
What does it say?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.309
She's gone where?

24:45.353 --> 24:47.747
Why would she do that?

24:47.790 --> 24:49.313
What the hell's going on?

24:49.357 --> 24:51.533
She left a note. She's running.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.364
I gotta go.

24:56.407 --> 25:00.499
Ms. Lopez, are you able
to produce your client?

25:00.542 --> 25:03.110
Your Honor, I'd like
to file for a continuance.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.851
On what grounds?

25:04.894 --> 25:07.027
Our client has had
a sudden hardship.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.942
Illuminate me.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.509
I'm afraid we're not able

25:10.552 --> 25:12.162
to do that at this time,
Your Honor.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.034
If you could give us 24 hours.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.036
This court date
has been set for weeks.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.690
Your client failed to appear

25:17.733 --> 25:20.431
and is officially in violation
of her bond agreement.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.000
Any of that sound incorrect?

25:24.044 --> 25:25.219
No, Your Honor.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.829
I have no choice but to issue

25:26.873 --> 25:29.310
an Order of Deportation
in Absentia.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.358
This Ava, leave a message.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.491
It's me. Ava, don't do this.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.189
If you run now you will never
be able to come back,

25:39.233 --> 25:41.583
and I need you to come back.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.846
Ava, please.

25:43.890 --> 25:47.894
Do not let these people
make you into a criminal.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.385
I don'tl don't understand.

26:01.429 --> 26:04.171
We can totally discuss it.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.955
You don't want to be my friend?

26:05.999 --> 26:08.262
I would love to be your friend.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.786
I am your friend.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.266
Just not once you have the baby.

26:12.309 --> 26:16.052
It would aa clean break
at that point, yes.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.750
So you can start your life

26:17.793 --> 26:20.840
and the baby isn't confused.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.933
One of Max's friends
tried an open adoption

26:26.976 --> 26:29.283
and itit got pretty complicated.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.112
He already thinks
I have boundary issues.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.636
So I would never see the baby?

26:34.680 --> 26:37.813
It would be his decision
when he's old enough.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.556
His...

26:41.600 --> 26:43.297
I'm sorry.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.866
Um, I think maybe you should go.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.433
- Katie...
- Please?

26:53.176 --> 26:56.440
- Nothing is set in stone.
- Please, go.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.924
We'll talk after the holidays?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.932
Merry Christmas.

27:19.202 --> 27:22.118
- That was brief.
- I'm gonna go for a walk.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.598
- I'll join you.
- I'm fine.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.562
Actually, you look like
you could use a friend.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.516
Don't bother.

27:28.559 --> 27:29.691
Wait, what?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.824
Hey!

27:31.867 --> 27:34.000
Katie, wait! Hey!

27:40.833 --> 27:42.269
Was it something I said?

27:42.312 --> 27:44.010
It's everything you say.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.402
How's that even possible?

27:45.446 --> 27:47.491
It's all pretend!
You don't mean any of it!

27:47.535 --> 27:48.841
What are you talking about?

27:48.884 --> 27:50.669
What are we?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.672
- Exactly.
- Katie!

27:55.761 --> 27:58.677
Hey, Katie, are you okay?
Talk to me!

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
You okay?

28:08.338 --> 28:09.862
Yeah.

28:11.254 --> 28:14.127
You wanna just stand here
for a minute?

28:24.877 --> 28:25.878
We can do that.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.583
I need some help!

28:40.196 --> 28:43.286
I don't know
what she was thinking.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.767
The note said
that she didn't want us

28:45.811 --> 28:48.291
to have to lie
if we were questioned.

28:48.335 --> 28:52.513
Yeah, well, it didn't say
where she thinks she can hide.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.516
How she's gonna work
and enroll Sami in school.

28:55.559 --> 28:59.085
However she has this figured,
I think the point is...

29:00.913 --> 29:02.610
They're together.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.221
Illegally.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.272
That's your heartbeat.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.802
Where is it?

29:25.154 --> 29:27.287
Well, why can't you find it?

29:27.330 --> 29:30.507
- We're still looking.
- It's all right, Katie.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.683
Maybe you're doing it wrong.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.774
You need to find his heartbeat!
You need to find it right now!

29:35.817 --> 29:37.732
Katie, Katie, hey.
Hey, look at me.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.865
- No, no!
- Look at me, hey.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.736
Look at me, look at me.
That's it, okay?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.085
Okay, okay?

29:43.129 --> 29:45.784
Now, show me
where you hold your courage.

30:00.407 --> 30:03.105
There it is.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.803
See?

30:04.846 --> 30:07.631
There it is.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.637
There it is.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.171
All right, easy does it.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.415
Take your time.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.548
Thank you.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.767
Thank you.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.310
Does it look familiar?

32:04.705 --> 32:06.837
What is it?

32:09.318 --> 32:12.017
It was dripping on us.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.973
I honestly thought we could win.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.281
Well, then you're
in good company.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.208
To Ava and Sami.

33:13.252 --> 33:17.038
May they be safe
and taken care of.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.171
And to my Gabie.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.476
A real lawyer.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.696
My client didn't show up.

33:22.739 --> 33:25.568
You did, and it made me proud.

33:25.612 --> 33:28.397
To the future.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.422
Got a job offer a few weeks ago.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.731
A private security company.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.562
Like a mall cop?

34:02.605 --> 34:04.651
No, training soldiers.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.263
In New York?

34:08.306 --> 34:10.960
- South Carolina.
- Yeah.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.400
The Veteran's hotel,
it's getting a little crowded.

34:15.444 --> 34:18.404
Technically,
I'm not supposed to have pets.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.406
You already accepted it.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.237
A week.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.766
I think it's time to start
figuring out my new life.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.469
Well, um...

34:41.514 --> 34:45.126
You should come back
to the Village until you go.

34:45.170 --> 34:48.216
Katie won't even know, and...

34:48.260 --> 34:51.132
there's no point paying rent.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.007
You do have a talent, you know.

34:58.792 --> 35:02.143
It's making people feel
like they're not alone.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.155
Enzo?

35:23.382 --> 35:25.340
Yours was better.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.954
Not better, just different.

35:36.351 --> 35:39.572
She's a hard woman
to live up to,

35:39.615 --> 35:41.878
your Rosemary.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.881
And, I, um...

35:47.188 --> 35:49.451
I can be a little stubborn.

35:49.495 --> 35:52.062
The more I fall for you,

35:52.106 --> 35:55.065
the more I feel like
I'm letting her go.

35:55.109 --> 35:58.243
You're falling for me?

35:58.286 --> 36:00.854
Like a Steinway out a window.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.597
Maybe I'm a fool,

36:04.640 --> 36:07.730
but I refuse
to step out of the way.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.488
Ava?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.534
Ben.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.146
Where are you?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.583
Near Canada.

36:34.627 --> 36:38.413
Hamid has family
we can stay with.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.894
They arrange a lawyer for us.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.245
Ava, if you do this
you can't come back.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.768
It's already done.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.006
But you're breaking the law.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.510
They want me
to leave the country.

36:48.554 --> 36:51.426
What difference does it make
where I go?

36:53.385 --> 36:55.778
For what it's worth...

36:55.822 --> 36:58.955
Hamid wanted
to leave yesterday...

36:58.999 --> 37:00.957
but I...

37:02.307 --> 37:05.875
I couldn't pass up
one more night with you.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.141
Is Sami okay?

37:11.185 --> 37:12.795
He's asleep.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.540
Well, can you make sure...

37:18.584 --> 37:20.455
that he knows I love him?

37:20.499 --> 37:23.153
He already does.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.068
We both do.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.464
Ava-Joon, we're all set.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.383
I have to go.

37:54.881 --> 37:57.927
Big day tomorrow.

37:57.971 --> 38:01.279
This one went by so fast.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.370
How you feeling?

38:06.936 --> 38:09.852
Wanted to get my house in order.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.856
Feels like everyone's in chaos.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.993
Well, I guess
you're just gonna have

38:20.036 --> 38:23.083
to pull through for them.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.043
Guess so.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.220
And for me.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.971
I'll do my best.

40:36.216 --> 40:38.087
You should keep
that wrist elevated,

40:38.131 --> 40:40.829
and I set my phone
to wake you every few hours.

40:40.873 --> 40:42.744
He said there was no concussion.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.485
Well, it's better safe
than sorry.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.401
- I can set my phone.
- It's no trouble.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.496
I'm in love with you.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.807
And...

41:01.850 --> 41:05.201
and you've been
very kind, but...

41:05.245 --> 41:08.553
it was never fair of me
to show up at your doorstep.

41:08.596 --> 41:11.730
I took advantage.

41:11.773 --> 41:12.818
Katie...

41:12.861 --> 41:14.733
I'm gonna leave in the morning.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.214
It's...

41:19.738 --> 41:22.697
It's too hard to pretend
that we're something we're not.

41:24.438 --> 41:27.528
But right now, I...
I'm gonna take a shower.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.748
Katie.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.794
I don't want you to go!

41:32.838 --> 41:35.536
Are you listening?

41:35.580 --> 41:37.146
I'm in love with you, too.

41:39.801 --> 41:42.151
It's just hard to know

41:42.195 --> 41:45.198
what's appropriate
in this situation.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.812
But whatever you want...

41:50.856 --> 41:54.555
If it's me, if it's not me...

41:54.599 --> 41:56.426
Whatever you want, it's yours.

42:12.965 --> 42:15.271
- Something's wrong.
- Okay.

42:15.315 --> 42:18.274
It's okay.
