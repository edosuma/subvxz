00:56.189 --> 01:00.182
"If I am fancy-free
And love to wander

01:02.128 --> 01:05.894
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

01:12.305 --> 01:16.571
"If I am fancy-free
And love to wander

01:17.811 --> 01:20.109
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

01:35.161 --> 01:37.152
'Bye, Lenny. You look nice.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.363
Don't go near the barrow.

01:42.569 --> 01:43.900
Lenny, leave it.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.869
I'll do it. Your clothes.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.008
Put your coat on.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.794
See you whenever, lads.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.152
- See you, Dad.
- Take it easy, Dad.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.523
Here, Vic, don't forget this.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.121
'Bye, Kath.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.679
I'm sorry, Vince.

02:39.425 --> 02:42.338
Leave it out.
I'm doing you a favor, Dad, ain't I?

02:42.362 --> 02:44.660
Don't work here anymore, remember?

02:48.801 --> 02:50.601
Won't be the same, will it?

02:52.572 --> 02:54.096
Won't be the same.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.174
You ain't seen the
last of him yet, Bern.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.702
You what?

02:58.778 --> 03:01.712
I said, you ain't seen
the last of Jack yet.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.644
'Course, Ray.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.034
It's on me, Lenny.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.161
Pint?

03:24.804 --> 03:26.499
This is a turn-up.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.006
New timetable, is it?

03:28.074 --> 03:29.336
'Morning, Bern.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.854
Retired now, are we, Lenny?

03:31.878 --> 03:36.392
No, I'm past the age for it, ain't I?
Not like Raysy here, man of leisure.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.543
Fruit and veg trade needs me.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.017
But not today?

03:46.492 --> 03:48.016
You haven't told him?

03:48.661 --> 03:49.958
No.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.498
So, we're going to Tucker's, yeah?

03:53.900 --> 03:57.199
- No, Vic's coming here.
- Eh?

03:57.270 --> 03:59.500
Vic's coming here. With Jack.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.468
Drink up.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.517
'Morning. Fresh out.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.887
Is that it? Is that him?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.051
That's him.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.727
- What are we drinking?
- What's inside?

04:23.796 --> 04:25.263
What do you think?

04:29.335 --> 04:31.747
Mine's a whisky. I think
it's a whisky day.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.305
I mean, he's not just in a box, is he?

04:34.374 --> 04:37.468
No, Lenny, he's not just in a box.

04:41.547 --> 04:42.844
Here you go.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.678
Doesn't seem possible, does it?

04:48.755 --> 04:51.033
- It's heavy, isn't it?
- Packed solid.

04:51.057 --> 04:54.618
Is this just him? I mean,
is this all of him?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.019
Where's Bernie got to?

04:57.096 --> 05:00.430
Jesus, Lucky,
and they reckoned you was pint-sized.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.195
Bern?

05:07.640 --> 05:08.902
What's that?

05:09.108 --> 05:11.099
It's Jack. Jack's ashes.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.776
- That's Jack?
- Yeah.

05:14.881 --> 05:19.147
Jesus God, what's he doing here?

05:19.218 --> 05:20.708
Last orders, Bernie.

05:21.654 --> 05:26.321
- Not like the ones you're used to, eh?
- Yeah, you know what they are.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.704
Didn't anyone tell you, Bern?

05:28.728 --> 05:32.262
Jack wanted to go to Margate.
Be scattered in the sea.

05:32.965 --> 05:36.699
So we thought we should have
a last look-in at the Coach.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.195
I see.

05:39.405 --> 05:43.398
Get me a large scotch, Bernie,
and one for yourself.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.234
I will. Thanks, Vic.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.547
No, no.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.014
It's on the house.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.962
- On the house.
- Cheers, cheers.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.186
- It ain't every day, is it?
- No.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.555
Yeah, Jesus God.

06:02.095 --> 06:06.225
To think he was just sitting there,
six weeks ago.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.658
Well, here's to him.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.331
Jack.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.342
Right, lads, whose shout?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.373
As if you didn't know.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.941
Just testing.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.793
You blokes would die of thirst
without me, wouldn't you?

06:24.817 --> 06:26.375
Same again, Bernie.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.244
Here, look at the form on this one.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.482
Cheers, darling.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.335
Don't you go coming on to us.
We're all married men here.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.160
- Some of us happily.
- Speak for yourself.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.341
Come on, Gunner.
Where would you be without your Joaney?

06:39.365 --> 06:41.697
"Always pissed and always late."

06:41.801 --> 06:45.464
No, where would any of us be
without our better halves?

06:47.707 --> 06:49.004
All right, darling?

06:49.075 --> 06:52.054
Listen, if you fancy little
fellas like Lucky here...

06:52.078 --> 06:55.023
...that is a different matter.
There is no Mrs. Raysy.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.725
You'd be doing us all a favor.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.062
He's been on his own too long.
Got set in his ways.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.577
All right, Raysy, all right.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.889
I think you could be
in there with a show, Luck?

07:11.464 --> 07:12.624
Well...

07:15.168 --> 07:16.658
Point taken, Bernie.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.782
Not much good for business, is it?

07:19.806 --> 07:22.406
Not doing yours any favors either, Vic.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.075
Here's to you, Vic.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.989
You did a really good job on Thursday.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.324
Yeah, the funeral went a treat, Vic.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.373
- Don't mention it.
- Yeah.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.747
How's Amy?

07:34.320 --> 07:35.446
Managing.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.100
- She ain't changed her mind about coming?
- No.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.058
She'll be with June as usual.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.005
Her decision, ain't it?

07:43.029 --> 07:44.223
Oh, yeah.

07:59.445 --> 08:00.571
Hi.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.051
- I'm going upstairs.
- Right.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.717
All we need now is our chauffeur.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.713
Well, they're playing his song.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.967
Wonder what he'll bring.
Seems to drive...

08:44.991 --> 08:47.536
...a different car every week,
as far as I can see.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.084
Same again all round?

08:49.562 --> 08:51.829
That'll be him. That'll be Vincey.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.765
Ain't he coming in?

08:53.933 --> 08:57.200
No, I think young Master Dodds
wants us out there.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.300
Jesus Christ.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.568
It's a Merc.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.470
Trust Big Boy.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.644
Jesus, it's a Merc.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.659
I just wanted to do Jack proud.
You know, give him a treat.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.729
This has been stuck in my showroom
for the past week, anyhow.

09:13.753 --> 09:17.287
I just thought the old man, Jack,
should get the best.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.304
I mean, look at it. Goes along
as sweet as a nut, doesn't it?

09:22.328 --> 09:25.161
About as sweet as your aftershave,
Big Boy.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.660
Don't put a dent in it!

09:30.069 --> 09:34.403
- Don't want to lose you a sale, do we?
- All right, relax, Lenny.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.921
What do you do
when you're out in the hearse, Vic?

09:38.945 --> 09:40.722
When you're going on a motorway?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.058
- You step on it.
- Don't encourage him, Vic.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.395
A hearse is different. Everyone
makes way for a hearse, don't they?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.286
You mean they don't make way
for Vince here?

09:51.490 --> 09:53.219
Busman's holiday, Vic?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.084
Oh, babe.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.517
Where's my kiss then?

10:24.624 --> 10:28.003
No, you got to throw a bucket of water
over them first, Jack.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.517
It's young love.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.592
Mandy, how about a kiss for me, darling?

10:33.032 --> 10:36.024
'Course, Jack. Come here then.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.781
Come on, let the dog
see the rabbit here.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.805
And get out of here.
Take this clown with you.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.972
I'm sorry, chaps. I've got to bail out.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.842
Because needs must.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.127
Well, you ain't 40 every
day, are you, Jack?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.415
Only comes once, eh, Lenny?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.131
Come on then, birthday boy.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.533
- You want a promise.
- Yeah, give us a minute.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.754
Happy birthday, Son. Good to see you.

11:03.763 --> 11:04.991
'Night, chaps.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.062
'Night, Jack.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.637
- Last orders.
- Coach is leaving.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.220
You dropped some money.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.989
- Last orders.
- But it ain't going anywhere as usual.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.844
Never does, does it?

11:23.115 --> 11:25.827
- What are you on about, Raysy?
- Here. Come here.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.014
Well, I'm saying
it's the Coach & Horses, but...

11:29.588 --> 11:32.580
...it's never gone anywhere, has it?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.929
Still ain't a car built yet
that can beat a jam, is there, Big Boy?

11:41.934 --> 11:44.601
Did Amy say why she ain't going and all?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.382
Makes no difference, does it?
Jack's none the wiser.

11:47.406 --> 11:51.753
I told Amy, if she wanted to scatter
the ashes in the cemetery garden...

11:51.777 --> 11:53.622
...he'd be none the wiser, either.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.547
- You an undertaker!
- You shouldn't judge.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.995
- Ashes is ashes.
- And best to do things prompt.

12:00.019 --> 12:04.166
- And wishes is wishes.
- How do we know he'll be none the wiser?

12:04.190 --> 12:07.669
Not that I would have been such a fool
as to make such a wish myself.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.760
Well, it weren't that specific.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.529
What wasn't specific?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.895
What he wrote. About his wishes.

12:14.800 --> 12:19.214
He didn't say that Amy had to do it,
he just said what he wanted done.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.038
Well, how do you know that?

12:21.107 --> 12:21.171
"To whom it may concern.

12:21.172 --> 12:22.772
"To whom it may concern.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.977
"Last orders.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.914
"...and my ashes taken forthwith..."

12:31.784 --> 12:34.984
This is all a bit formal
for old Jack, ain't it?

12:35.888 --> 12:37.955
"From the end of Margate pier"?

12:38.724 --> 12:39.884
Margate?

12:40.860 --> 12:44.172
Suppose he thought he'd get there
in the end. One way or the other.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.720
When did he write it?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.833
It was a couple of days before.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.812
Well, why didn't he just tell you?

12:50.836 --> 12:53.482
I suppose he thought
that I'd think he was joking.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.840
I mean that way he makes it proper.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.523
Well, if you want to do it, Amy,
I'll take you.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.414
- What, in the old camper?
- Yeah, 'course.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.544
No.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.919
I can't do it, Ray.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.817
I mean, thank you, but...

13:14.059 --> 13:15.526
...I don't want to.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.229
It's a dying man's request, Amy.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.522
Would you do it, Ray?

13:20.633 --> 13:24.379
That way it gets done, doesn't it?
That way his last wish gets carried out.

13:24.403 --> 13:27.403
It only says,
"To whom it may concern" anyway.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.336
All right, I'll do it.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.276
Yeah, 'course I'll do it.
What about Vince?

13:34.613 --> 13:37.241
I haven't told Vincey. Not about this.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.183
Well, I mean, I will, but...

13:39.318 --> 13:41.252
...maybe you and him could...

13:41.487 --> 13:42.977
I'll talk to Vince.

13:43.756 --> 13:47.283
And maybe Lenny and Vic
will want to go as well.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.628
It's not even like his writing, is it?

13:52.031 --> 13:53.589
Moment's come, Ray.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.862
Time to sell up the shop.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.836
Well, there's more to life than bacon,
ain't there?

14:00.039 --> 14:01.597
It's only fair on Amy.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.086
I never made my mind up till about,
well, five minutes ago.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.244
I was swabbing down those trays.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.212
You know what today is?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.322
June's 50th birthday.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.918
June 1, 1939.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.064
And it's Amy's day for seeing her.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.377
She asked me to go, of course.

14:29.401 --> 14:33.315
Well, she never said nothing,
but I knew what she was thinking.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.673
Fifty years is special or it ain't.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.976
So, you know, I said to her:

14:39.144 --> 14:42.411
"I'll close up early
and I'll see you down there."

14:42.514 --> 14:45.448
I mean, I wasn't saying
anything definite...

14:45.584 --> 14:48.052
...but it was still like a promise.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.984
But when the time came...

14:51.557 --> 14:53.357
...a couple of hours ago...

14:54.526 --> 14:56.526
- ...I couldn't change.
- Yeah.

14:57.429 --> 14:58.828
Not like that.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.467
So, I thought I could change
in another way.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.736
I can tell her something.
Something to compensate.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.369
I can tell her I'm packing it in.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.966
Look who it ain't.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.573
- It's Mr. Rest In Peace.
- At your disposal.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.578
- Business slow?
- By no means lively.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.931
- No lodgers?
- Just the one. We going down the Coach?

15:22.955 --> 15:25.400
I hope so. There's
something to celebrate.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.891
- What's that?
- Guess.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.121
No, you can't say that.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.128
I've got to tell Amy first.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.242
When he told me, he looked at
me as if I'd be dead chuffed...

15:34.266 --> 15:37.846
...as if he wasn't looking at the woman
he'd been looking at for 50 years.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.749
See what I'm saying, girl?
I'm jacking it in.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.537
You get it? Jacking it in?

15:44.643 --> 15:48.010
I thought maybe we'd get a bungalow
by the seaside.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.249
Margate, maybe.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.343
<i>Margate, where it all went wrong.</i>

15:54.586 --> 15:58.833
<i>Because he couldn't stand that his
daughter, that our June, wasn't normal.</i>

15:58.857 --> 16:00.950
- Margate.
- Yeah, Margate.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.438
Yeah, well, what about June?

16:03.462 --> 16:06.808
That's my point. If I can give up
being Jack Dodds, family butcher...

16:06.832 --> 16:10.632
...you can give up going on
this fool's errand every week.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.802
<i>Fool's errand.</i>

16:14.039 --> 16:16.840
That's what he called
it, "Fool's errand."

16:19.411 --> 16:20.922
So we were going to be...

16:20.946 --> 16:23.312
New people. Happy days.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.380
New people.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.153
In Margate?

16:31.790 --> 16:35.003
I don't think we could've done it.
Not when you totted it all up.

16:35.027 --> 16:38.258
Not when you took away
what he owed on the shop.

16:39.865 --> 16:44.112
We would've been a fair bit short.
Don't know where that leaves me.

16:44.136 --> 16:47.003
- How much short, Amy?
- It's about £20,000.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.583
Next stop, Fairfax Park.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.588
Fairfax Park.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.284
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
Stop, stop, stop.</i>

17:33.285 --> 17:35.997
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
Stop, stop, stop.</i>

17:36.021 --> 17:38.216
<i>This is getting very silly.</i>

17:46.065 --> 17:47.430
Hello, June.

17:47.566 --> 17:51.764
<i>Well, it doesn't look like
a serious sort of shoe to me.</i>

17:52.371 --> 17:56.371
<i>I'm sure there are lots of things
one can use one's shoe for.</i>

18:02.047 --> 18:03.810
<i>I can think of one.</i>

18:04.016 --> 18:05.506
<i>Can you, Charlie?</i>

18:05.584 --> 18:08.329
Amy's seeing June.
It's her day for seeing June.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.998
She could leave one day off.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.622
I mean, it's not like it's a normal day,
is it, really?

18:14.326 --> 18:17.005
Raysy here is a mine
of information, isn't he?

18:17.029 --> 18:19.974
It's like the horses.
Have to prise it out of him these days.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.911
Is that getting heavy, Vic?
You want me to take it for a bit?

18:22.935 --> 18:25.713
- No, it's fine, Ray.
- But even then he gives you duff tips.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.967
Here, last tip I gave came good.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.285
Well, it weren't for any of us.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.606
Who, Raysy?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.844
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.960
<i>And the whole world thought
that Jack Dodds...</i>

18:38.984 --> 18:41.118
...had finally seen the light...

18:41.453 --> 18:43.787
...and decided to start a new life.

18:43.889 --> 18:44.022
What the world didn't know...

18:44.023 --> 18:45.957
What the world didn't know...

18:45.991 --> 18:50.325
...was that I'd taken out a loan
to save the shop, five years ago.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.990
And it comes up. In a month.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.013
That wouldn't be a problem.
I sell the house, I sell the shop...

18:59.037 --> 19:04.037
...I buy a small tin-pot bungalow in
Margate and scrape by on the remainder.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.106
Except that's all off now, isn't it?

19:10.516 --> 19:12.516
All bets are off, aren't they?

19:15.454 --> 19:16.887
How much?

19:17.990 --> 19:22.324
Well, it was seven large
when I took it on...

19:23.662 --> 19:25.907
- ...but now they want £20,000.
- You're joking?

19:25.931 --> 19:29.332
No, we're not talking bank managers,
you know, here.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.504
It's a special loan. Private loan.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.362
Not Vince?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.643
No, no.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.945
Vince wouldn't lend me money
if I was dying.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.060
Well, if you can't see
what is right under your nose...

19:46.084 --> 19:48.997
There's a new supermarket
just down the road...

19:49.021 --> 19:52.433
...and they've offered you first refusal
to be their new meat manager.

19:52.457 --> 19:55.036
- You've got no choice, have you?
- Haven't I?

19:55.060 --> 19:57.572
Well, that's down to you, Dad.
That's your funeral.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.875
Don't come running back to me.
Don't expect me to lay out any money.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.699
At least I'd be my own man.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.268
Your own man?

20:05.837 --> 20:10.304
You never was your own man.
You was your old man's man, weren't you?

20:10.576 --> 20:12.710
That cuts both ways, doesn't it?

20:12.844 --> 20:14.522
That should have been our shop.

20:14.546 --> 20:18.073
Dad, just don't expect
me to bail you out.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.750
I ain't got it.

20:21.253 --> 20:25.987
Bit of a dry argument over here, Jack.
Wouldn't be your shout, would it?

20:37.636 --> 20:38.933
There's a tenner.

20:39.004 --> 20:43.218
Buy your mates a drink, a couple of
drinks. Buy yourself one. I'm going home.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.436
So who?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.108
Some of Vince's pals from the old days.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.941
Business pals.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.285
Rough stuff. Understand?

20:56.989 --> 21:00.034
You look like you're begging
with that bowl there.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.389
Yeah.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.196
It's Amy I'm thinking about, Raysy.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.227
When I, you know...

21:10.936 --> 21:15.803
She might want to stay put or want to
go through with the bungalow anyway.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.674
It ain't been kiboshed yet.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.479
She might have other plans.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.283
Either way...

21:28.754 --> 21:33.154
...I don't want to see a debt collector
knocking at her front door.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.495
Hello, Nurse.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.031
Do you know my friend Ray, Kelly?

21:42.434 --> 21:43.560
Yeah.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.169
Take his pulse, it's faster than mine.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.841
You'd be all right there.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.571
You don't change, do you?

21:55.580 --> 21:57.207
I need a winner, Raysy.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.150
I need a winner.

22:01.086 --> 22:04.286
I need it
like I've never needed anything before.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.887
Here.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.896
Feel in there. Get that out.
Yeah, in there. There, look.

22:14.066 --> 22:17.593
- What, this?
- Yeah. It's got 1,000 smackers in it.

22:18.603 --> 22:22.369
Eight hundred in fifties,
and the rest in twenties.

22:23.475 --> 22:27.088
You got £1,000 in readies in a place
like this? What are you doing?

22:27.112 --> 22:30.512
Who's going to nick it in here?
These poor bastards?

22:31.049 --> 22:34.495
- Well, where did you get it?
- Well, that'd be telling, wouldn't it?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.384
Open it. Count it.

22:37.255 --> 22:40.418
- No, I trust you.
- No, open it. Open it.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.091
It's a thick 'un, Jack.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.794
£1,000 to get £20,000.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.034
It's a thick 'un.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.405
What if I put it on the wrong nag?

22:55.574 --> 22:57.235
You can't, can you?

22:58.310 --> 22:59.834
Amy needs it.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.078
Think of it...

23:04.783 --> 23:06.375
...as buying a camper.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.588
£1,000. Remember?

23:14.092 --> 23:16.893
You didn't want to sell
it to me, did you?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.595
The camper.

23:28.373 --> 23:31.433
Can anyone tell me, why Margate?

23:31.943 --> 23:34.922
That's where we used to go
on our Sunday outings.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.546
Here, Lenny, remember the old meat van?

23:39.418 --> 23:43.685
You think I don't remember, Big Boy?
What with our Sally and all.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.591
Yeah, she used to love her Sunday
outings to Margate, while they lasted.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.581
<i>Hello, Sally.</i>

23:49.194 --> 23:51.806
- See you tonight, Lenny.
- Sal, don't forget your basket.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.775
Sally, behave yourself.
Have a good time.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.643
- We'll have a beer, Len.
- Ta-ta, Sally.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.446
They are getting like brother
and sister, aren't they?

23:58.470 --> 24:02.270
Yeah, one big happy family.
Or so Amy would like to think.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.185
Sally, wave to Mummy. Wave.

24:04.209 --> 24:07.609
As if we wouldn't take her to the beach
if we could.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.442
See you, Lenny. Joan.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.220
Poor Lenny.

24:19.758 --> 24:24.359
I know what it's like not to be able
to take your daughter to the sea.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.836
<i>Vincey. Sally.</i>

24:38.176 --> 24:39.871
Sal, come on, come here.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.123
What is that? What is that?

24:42.147 --> 24:46.547
<i>It's not the same as having your own
daughter there, but it helped.</i>

24:48.053 --> 24:50.164
- There's a swan. See it?
- Yeah.

24:50.188 --> 24:52.213
<i>It was good while it lasted.</i>

24:52.591 --> 24:56.858
Little Sally got too big though.
Too big for our little meat van.

25:05.103 --> 25:07.748
<i>Vincey's little playmate
was growing up fast.</i>

25:07.772 --> 25:10.639
<i>And don't think
that Vincey wasn't noticing.</i>

25:11.376 --> 25:12.866
<i>Little beggar.</i>

25:15.947 --> 25:17.947
<i>No more front seat for Vincey.</i>

25:23.555 --> 25:25.045
You got too big, lad.

25:37.569 --> 25:41.369
Then Vincey goes and throws up
all over the picnic things.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.216
You all right, lad?

25:53.051 --> 25:53.983
Come on.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.386
<i>And no more Margate for Sally Tate.</i>

25:57.322 --> 26:01.258
It's a long way from a
meat van to a Merc.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.062
And this ain't no Sunday outing.

26:08.967 --> 26:11.501
Do you think he was just trying it on?

26:12.003 --> 26:13.737
Just to see if we'd do it?

26:14.172 --> 26:15.867
So you think he knows.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.643
You think he can still
see us, don't you?

26:21.012 --> 26:24.012
'Course he can't see us.
He can't see nothing.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.646
Mind you, Big Boy...

26:27.719 --> 26:32.700
...if he can't see us, if he can't see
nothing, why did you go and bring a Merc?

26:32.724 --> 26:34.302
It's the gesture, Lenny.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.318
It's a nice gesture.
It's a beautiful car.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.223
It ain't no meat van.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.836
Margate.

26:48.807 --> 26:52.987
Uncle Bert hocked his grandfather clock
so Jack and I could go to Margate.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.273
First time.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.746
Margate. For the weekend.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.245
No! Don't ask, all fixed.

26:59.684 --> 27:03.598
Just get your old man to give you
the time off. Say it's your honeymoon.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.647
Steamer from Tower Bridge.

27:07.692 --> 27:08.954
What do you think?

27:09.027 --> 27:12.740
Well, it's easy to believe when you're
18 that you can make a fresh start.

27:12.764 --> 27:16.431
The world doesn't have to come to an end
just because...

27:19.104 --> 27:23.905
I think I came as close as I ever did
to ditching June then.

27:25.443 --> 27:26.921
I wanted to know that...

27:26.945 --> 27:30.079
<i>...if he didn't want her,
at least he wanted me.</i>

27:34.452 --> 27:36.852
<i>It's where they had their honeymoon.</i>

27:37.856 --> 27:39.118
Margate.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.891
That's why.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.137
I didn't think they had no honeymoon.

27:43.161 --> 27:46.040
I thought they were saving up
for a pram at the time.

27:46.064 --> 27:50.057
Yeah, they had a honeymoon later,
after June was born.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.566
Yeah, he's right.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.035
Summer of '39.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.104
<i>Must have been some honeymoon.</i>

28:06.384 --> 28:10.480
You can pick your chocolate, your china,
or your teddy bear.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.113
<i>You'd think they could do something
these days.</i>

28:59.137 --> 29:01.804
Think they could come up with something.

29:01.873 --> 29:04.285
<i>It was the only time
he ever talked about her.</i>

29:04.309 --> 29:08.089
<i>Couldn't face the fact that his daughter
"didn't have all her marbles"...</i>

29:08.113 --> 29:09.913
<i>...as he so bluntly put it.</i>

29:10.915 --> 29:12.542
I had this idea once...

29:13.485 --> 29:16.019
...this stupid idea of being a doctor.

29:17.956 --> 29:19.583
But I ain't, am I?

29:20.558 --> 29:23.692
No more than you is
bloody Florence Nightingale.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.230
The best thing we can do, Amy...

29:27.665 --> 29:29.530
...is forget all about her.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.326
<i>Put her away.</i>

29:32.637 --> 29:34.371
<i>Out of sight, out of mind.</i>

29:35.106 --> 29:36.698
<i>It's what you did then.</i>

29:39.844 --> 29:43.911
And that was where he wanted us
to spend the rest of our days.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.341
Happy days.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.122
<i>Well, June...</i>

29:57.462 --> 29:58.929
...your dad, Jack...

30:00.265 --> 30:02.799
...they're scattering his ashes today.

30:03.334 --> 30:06.668
In the sea, off the pier,
at Margate of all places.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.043
Your brother Vince is going.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.542
Uncle Ray. Lenny.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.547
Vic, of course.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.119
Yeah, well...

30:25.089 --> 30:27.601
...let them go, June.
The whole bunch of them.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.359
Let them do it without me
and without you.

30:33.398 --> 30:35.195
The living come first.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.302
Even the living
who were as good as dead to him.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.436
There's no more. Here.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.343
Here you go.

30:59.924 --> 31:01.721
Jack in a box, eh, Vic?

31:01.793 --> 31:05.873
- Do you want to hand him over here, Vic?
- Sorry, Raysy. I was forgetting.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.764
- Do you want to hold him for a bit?
- Yeah.

31:15.773 --> 31:18.118
- Are you quite comfy there, Vic?
- Sure am.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.439
Good, isn't it?

31:19.577 --> 31:22.623
All seats are power adjustable.
Upholstery's all customized.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.459
- Yeah, but Vic ain't a customer, is he?
- Who says?

31:25.483 --> 31:27.917
- How much you asking, Vince?
- What?

31:27.986 --> 31:29.830
Bit of respect, please, Lenny.

31:29.854 --> 31:33.119
Well, it's a nice motor, Vic.
I mean, it's a...

31:33.224 --> 31:37.691
...bit heavy on the petrol,
but 65K on the clock and it's genuine...

31:38.897 --> 31:40.262
Just testing.

31:44.035 --> 31:46.347
So when are you going to retire, Vic?

31:46.371 --> 31:48.382
No rush. There's a few customers...

31:48.406 --> 31:50.473
...I shall hang around for yet.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.487
Why do you think my name's Vic?

31:53.511 --> 31:57.711
- Why is your name Vic?
- Well, I'm halfway to a vicar, ain't I?

31:58.716 --> 32:00.547
You could swan it, Vic.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.313
Better than Margate.

32:02.387 --> 32:05.699
- Big Boy here is aiming for the Bahamas.
- Being a grand a throw.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.281
Is that what Jack cost?

32:07.358 --> 32:09.737
Bloody hell, Joan had
better start saving.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.038
That's what I heard.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.796
- Very comfy seats these. I could nod off.
- Bloody hell.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.598
Jack.

32:18.236 --> 32:19.794
It's me, Vince.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.904
Jack.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.833
It's me. Jack.

32:28.212 --> 32:30.339
I ain't lost my marbles, Vince.

32:31.816 --> 32:33.306
I know it's you.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.184
I know it's me.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.790
- Want to swap?
- Nah.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.253
Her name's Joy.

32:47.765 --> 32:51.378
I bet she can give you bundles of
it and all by the way she looks.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.869
You fell right on your feet in here,
ain't you, Jack?

32:55.173 --> 32:56.650
- Here. Come here.
- What?

32:56.674 --> 32:58.301
- Sit down.
- Why?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.491
Amy doesn't know what's happening,
does she, Son?

33:04.515 --> 33:05.777
No.

33:05.950 --> 33:09.284
She doesn't know
whether she's coming or going, eh?

33:09.787 --> 33:11.482
She's all right.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.790
She's managing.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.491
Oh, Mum.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.021
Come here, come here.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.589
Come here. Come here.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.401
It's all right. Come here.

33:25.269 --> 33:26.759
She'll manage.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.464
I got the easier part.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.939
It don't seem much of a doddle to me.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.806
People panic.

33:44.655 --> 33:47.988
What do you want
to talk to me about, Jack?

33:51.729 --> 33:53.863
I want you to lend me some cash.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.810
- Cash?
- Yeah, I need some cash, Son.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.597
- You need cash?
- Yeah.

33:58.669 --> 34:01.736
- What, you need cash in here?
- Yeah, in here.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.705
No, no.

34:08.913 --> 34:10.471
I need £1,000.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.645
- £1,000?
- Yeah.

34:17.021 --> 34:18.488
You need £1,000?

34:18.556 --> 34:21.923
Yeah. By Friday, let's say.
And not a dickey-bird.

34:22.794 --> 34:25.627
- Yeah, but...
- Don't ask, Vince.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.221
Don't ask.

34:29.033 --> 34:30.523
It's a request, Son.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.764
Not an order.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.606
- Lend?
- Yeah.

34:38.676 --> 34:39.700
Well...

34:41.546 --> 34:45.613
If Vincey's young Kath can retire, Vic,
I reckon you can, too.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.784
I'll have to think about it.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.152
She didn't retire.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.101
She's still working for you
at the garage, is she?

34:54.125 --> 34:55.636
It's called a showroom, Lenny.

34:55.660 --> 34:58.185
I'm sorry. Showroom.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.530
We all know what's on show, don't we?

35:03.968 --> 35:06.235
Nah, she packed it in, didn't she?

35:06.771 --> 35:09.416
<i>Reckon you lost an asset there, Big Boy.</i>

35:09.440 --> 35:15.307
<i>I mean, I think one of her skirts was worth
six of your ties for bringing the punters in.</i>

35:15.646 --> 35:19.626
What do you say we all stop somewhere
for lunch? Have a break?

35:19.650 --> 35:23.130
Good idea, Vic. Jack would've reckoned
on us having a break for lunch.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.165
Anyway, I hear she ain't out of a job.

35:25.189 --> 35:27.885
- You hungry, Lenny?
- No, I'm thirsty.

35:28.092 --> 35:32.188
What I hear is that she's pulling
in punters of her own now.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.662
Hark who's talking.

35:33.731 --> 35:36.710
I've heard your Sally
is taking in paying lodgers, as it were.

35:36.734 --> 35:39.012
Is that why the two
of you ain't talking?

35:39.036 --> 35:44.084
No, the blokes she picks ain't too handy.
They like leaving her in the lurch.

35:44.108 --> 35:48.021
Like the one she's married to, who's
in jail. Thanks to you, Big Boy.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.657
A hot car's a hot car.
Two wrongs don't make a right.

35:50.681 --> 35:55.345
Yes, and her childhood sweetheart
who buggered off to the Army.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.111
<i>Vincey Dodds.</i>

35:57.722 --> 36:01.589
I ain't no Dodds, and I ain't
going to be no butcher's boy.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.495
It's easy for men.
They can go and be soldiers.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.399
- Go off to sea.
- Yeah, sure, Sally.

36:13.070 --> 36:17.004
So, what are you going to be, Vince?
What do you want to be?

36:17.074 --> 36:18.701
Come on, you know, Sal.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.813
- Motors.
- Motors.

36:23.414 --> 36:24.608
Yeah.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.114
See that '59 Mark IX?

36:31.088 --> 36:34.888
It's a start, ain't it?
Ain't any old jam jar, it's a Jag.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.927
And I'll make it like new again.

36:38.496 --> 36:42.430
One of these days Jack will come
crawling to me. You'll see.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.471
Five years. Vincey signed
up for five years.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.017
Couldn't wait to get away.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.553
You can't say he ain't following
in your footsteps.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.888
You was a soldier once
as well as a butcher.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.646
I was a butcher by choice.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.359
Soldier? Bleeding
defaulter, I'd call him.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.929
A bleeding deserter,
that's what I'd call him.

37:01.953 --> 37:06.887
It's supposed to be "Dodds & Son."
That's what the sign over the shop says.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.018
Wasn't the only reason.

37:09.660 --> 37:13.127
What you think was his reason
wasn't his only reason.

37:13.497 --> 37:15.192
You don't own him, Jack.

37:15.533 --> 37:18.400
- We don't own them, do we?
- Make sense.

37:19.003 --> 37:22.549
We don't own them, do we?
Even when we own them, we don't.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.268
You're talking bollocks.

37:25.476 --> 37:27.810
No, the other reason was our Sally.

37:28.479 --> 37:31.380
He left her a little leaving present.

37:31.549 --> 37:32.641
Sally?

37:32.717 --> 37:36.463
- I'd say she's going to have to get rid of it.
- Vincey got her pregnant?

37:36.487 --> 37:40.287
So, I reckon I'm going to need
one of your winners, Raysy.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.422
Real quick.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.321
Sally?

37:46.364 --> 37:49.176
I thought they'd finish up together,
Vincey and Sally.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.334
They nearly had to, didn't they?

37:54.805 --> 37:57.072
Daughters, who'd have them, Raysy?

38:00.011 --> 38:02.522
I reckon you got the right idea,
you know, Vic.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.692
You get yourself a couple of sons,
put them into the firm...

38:05.716 --> 38:07.980
...and then you can bow out easy.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.131
- Passing on the torch and all that.
- Can't complain.

38:11.155 --> 38:12.747
"Tucker & Sons."

38:13.491 --> 38:15.425
Sounds good, don't it, Vince?

38:15.693 --> 38:19.339
"Tuckers," that's what we're called
and what we do: we tuck them up.

38:19.363 --> 38:21.275
- Don't it, Vince?
- I'm here! I came!

38:21.299 --> 38:23.699
Gents, just remember who's on board.

38:23.734 --> 38:24.962
Okay.

38:25.736 --> 38:26.570
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>

38:26.571 --> 38:27.948
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>

38:27.972 --> 38:31.084
...letting me use the yard
to mess around with motors.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.442
Your kindness to an ex-soldier boy.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.446
But I can't expect that to go on indef,
can I?

38:40.284 --> 38:42.479
I ain't ungrateful, Uncle Ray.

38:45.289 --> 38:48.725
So what are you suggesting?
That you pay rent?

38:49.427 --> 38:50.485
What with?

38:50.928 --> 38:53.795
I'm talking ownership.
We're talking buying.

38:54.065 --> 38:57.000
It's the same question twice over.
What with?

38:58.102 --> 39:01.214
I'm asking you to make an investment,
Raysy, in Dodds Motors.

39:01.238 --> 39:05.285
It don't exist yet, but it will in five
years. You don't have to fork out a penny.

39:05.309 --> 39:08.955
You sell me the yard as premises, you
loan me out the asking for five years.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.892
Come five years,
I pay your price plus a percentage.

39:11.916 --> 39:16.163
If I can't stump up, the yard's yours
again. Plain and simple. You can't lose.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.798
Once I've another car on the go...

39:17.822 --> 39:20.300
...and I have the margin,
I'll give you a deposit.

39:20.324 --> 39:22.858
You can keep that and all.
Another one?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.659
Before we go any further...

39:26.230 --> 39:27.788
...there's one thing.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.277
- What's that?
- It's called a butcher's shop.

39:30.301 --> 39:34.601
Yeah, "Dodds and Son." He ain't
still going on about that, is he?

39:35.272 --> 39:37.502
His old man put that sign up.

39:52.256 --> 39:54.390
I'd want to keep my camper here.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.560
I still need my own
space for the camper.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.160
'Course you can. No charge.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.779
I'll even give it a regular
once-over for you.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.549
And if you ever want to trade it in,
I'll see you get a good deal.

40:09.573 --> 40:14.307
How could you sell him the yard?
Vince is supposed to be working for me.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.190
What does it say on the shop?
You've seen the sign?

40:17.214 --> 40:19.793
"Next generation. Like
father, like son."

40:19.817 --> 40:23.630
Don't you think it's time to forget
about that? He's got his own mind.

40:23.654 --> 40:26.767
You can't kid yourself no more.
Motors ain't just his hobby.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.170
- He's not doing it for the love of it.
- No thanks to Ray.

40:30.194 --> 40:33.974
I'm just returning the favor. Looking
after him like you looked after me.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.943
He should be cutting up meat,
not mucking about with motors.

40:36.967 --> 40:40.903
And in case you haven't noticed,
Vince is your lad, Jack.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.899
Chip off the old block.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.268
Have a drink.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.474
<i>"Dodds & Son."</i>

40:47.545 --> 40:51.691
That's all Jack ever wanted from Vince.
I mean, even if he had to pretend.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.182
Fathers and sons.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.546
What did you want from June?

40:58.222 --> 40:59.553
Just a sign.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.636
Not once in 50 years
did she give me a sign.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.605
Not even a flicker that she knew me,
who I was.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.359
Fifty years. Every week.

41:08.833 --> 41:12.701
- Except for a few weeks, 20 years ago.
- Yeah.

41:15.940 --> 41:20.807
We should've had our fights, June and
me. You know, mothers and daughters.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.206
Where's the luck, Amy?

41:25.182 --> 41:26.774
It's all down to luck.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.487
You hear much from your Susie
in Australia these days, Raysy?

41:35.125 --> 41:36.217
Not really.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.227
I mean,
do you think she'd come if you was...

41:39.864 --> 41:41.559
Do you mean dead, Lenny?

41:43.100 --> 41:45.434
I mean, do you think she'd show up?

41:45.469 --> 41:48.233
- What a question.
- It's a fair one.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.606
I've never thought about it.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.336
Australia's a long way.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.911
It's not as far
as from here to the next world.

41:57.114 --> 41:58.479
What next world?

41:58.816 --> 42:01.842
It's a manner of speaking, Big Boy.

42:01.919 --> 42:04.581
Sydney is further than Sydenham.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.187
That's very clever.

42:06.257 --> 42:08.768
Raysy, we'll pop in to Sydenham
on the way back.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.938
Slide round the South Circular,
surprise your ex, Carol.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.273
Like we'd be welcome.

42:13.297 --> 42:16.528
You think she'd come?
I mean, if it was your...

42:17.001 --> 42:19.526
Funeral, Lenny. The word's "funeral."

42:20.771 --> 42:22.705
Only to make sure I was dead.

42:43.594 --> 42:44.788
Cup of tea?

42:46.864 --> 42:48.931
- Thanks, Dad.
- Turn that down.

42:50.134 --> 42:51.499
Thanks.

42:52.002 --> 42:54.402
Nice having you back for a few days.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.506
- The trip was great. Andy was great.
- Yeah?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.842
You know he found out where they lived.

43:00.878 --> 43:04.345
- Where who lived?
- Andy's family. Back in the past.

43:04.848 --> 43:08.382
- Before they went to Australia.
- Yeah. Nice for you.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.620
You going down to the Coach?

43:12.122 --> 43:14.923
Yeah. The Coach ain't
coming to me, is it?

43:17.895 --> 43:19.260
Yeah.

43:25.235 --> 43:27.226
Are you sure about Australia?

43:28.472 --> 43:30.206
Ain't you got a home here?

43:31.542 --> 43:34.136
And what about college? And teaching?

43:34.712 --> 43:37.991
There's colleges in Australia.
And teachers in Australia.

43:38.015 --> 43:40.260
But you don't know nothing
about Australia.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.447
I'll find out, won't I?
Andy will show me.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.010
Yeah, I bet he will.

43:45.589 --> 43:48.056
I could show him the back of my hand.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.716
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:58.369 --> 43:59.768
There's your fare.

44:03.073 --> 44:05.974
And don't you breathe a word about that.

44:08.879 --> 44:11.473
Fifth at Chepstow. Silver Lord.

44:14.051 --> 44:15.746
Came in by half a length.

44:20.257 --> 44:21.622
Sue...

44:21.925 --> 44:23.916
I know, Dad. I know.

44:25.095 --> 44:26.357
Thank you.

44:27.631 --> 44:29.428
You're the best dad.

44:29.733 --> 44:32.467
And don't you worry,
I'll look after Sue.

44:34.071 --> 44:38.151
I tell you, I'm feeling really in tune
now that I've been here to England.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.919
You know, tapped into my roots.

44:39.943 --> 44:42.956
I'm feeling so much more together now
because of...

44:42.980 --> 44:45.647
...everything, you know, because of Sue.

44:47.384 --> 44:48.908
Cheers, Mr. Johnson.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.854
I can't thank you enough.
That was some horse, eh?

45:03.734 --> 45:05.292
Good night, everyone.

45:12.042 --> 45:13.839
Carol, listen.

45:14.912 --> 45:19.781
If she goes, I don't want to see her
ever again. Understand that?

45:20.184 --> 45:24.484
- Carol, you can't stop her. She's 18.
- And I'm not.

45:25.389 --> 45:26.686
Come here.

46:07.898 --> 46:08.956
Come here.

46:09.032 --> 46:12.299
I've got something to show you.
Out in the street.

46:18.642 --> 46:21.338
Rockabilly. Newmarket. 100-to-8.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.072
What is it?

46:25.215 --> 46:26.580
It's a Dormobile.

46:26.817 --> 46:29.684
It's a camper van.
A traveling home for two.

46:29.887 --> 46:31.980
As we're a couple again.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.416
It's a deluxe model.

46:38.328 --> 46:39.920
That's the last straw.

46:43.801 --> 46:49.001
<i>I guess she decided she wanted more out
of life than trips in my little camper.</i>

46:49.239 --> 46:53.239
<i>But the sub-manager of a bleeding
domestic appliance store...</i>

46:54.111 --> 46:56.739
...Barry bleeding Stokes.

46:58.749 --> 46:59.716
Yeah.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.785
She couldn't tell me to my face.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.254
No, it was over the phone.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.189
"Goodbye, Ray."

47:09.359 --> 47:11.426
I never said, "Goodbye, Carol."

47:11.695 --> 47:12.992
Nah.

47:13.730 --> 47:15.925
That was my one cheap comeback.

47:16.466 --> 47:20.666
I didn't say goodbye. I just hung
up and sat there not moving...

47:21.738 --> 47:25.105
...not budging till 6:00 in the morning.

47:26.877 --> 47:28.606
She got me thinking.

47:30.214 --> 47:31.948
I ought to go and see Sue.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.315
You know?

47:34.618 --> 47:36.485
While I'm still... Before...

47:38.188 --> 47:41.487
Mind you, I haven't spoken to Sue for...

47:42.092 --> 47:44.226
...I can't think how many years.

47:44.361 --> 47:47.524
You can't blame her for that though.
Not really.

47:48.398 --> 47:51.911
That was more me, I think.
I just stopped writing one day.

47:51.935 --> 47:54.870
You know how it is. Things just stop.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.406
Then it seems too long
to start them again.

47:59.443 --> 48:00.910
So, what...

48:01.111 --> 48:04.311
What do you think, Amy?
About going to Australia?

48:05.983 --> 48:07.416
Seeing Sue?

48:08.218 --> 48:09.947
It's not too late, is it?

48:13.023 --> 48:15.824
I might have grandchildren.
You never know.

48:19.630 --> 48:22.297
- You ain't said yet, Raysy?
- Said what?

48:22.366 --> 48:25.366
If you think Sue would show up
to see you off.

48:26.336 --> 48:28.536
Yeah, but Australia's a long way.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.303
Well, if not Sue, then who?

48:33.677 --> 48:37.807
I mean, if you had some special,
daft request like Jack here.

48:37.881 --> 48:41.615
- I ain't going to have no daft request.
- But who knows?

48:42.419 --> 48:43.852
There's you.

48:44.855 --> 48:47.189
You want to think twice about that?

48:48.058 --> 48:52.192
Unless you're thinking of,
you know, planning something sooner.

48:53.030 --> 48:55.408
You'll be all right, Raysy.
I'll be about.

48:55.432 --> 48:59.232
I reckon they should chuck you
over the straight at Epsom.

48:59.803 --> 49:02.482
What about you, Lenny,
where do you want to be chucked?

49:02.506 --> 49:06.408
I'm with Raysy. I'm not choosy.
It ain't material.

49:06.910 --> 49:09.255
- Ashes is material.
- Yeah, come on, Lenny.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.091
- But what about you, Vic?
- That's all arranged.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.446
What's arranged?

49:13.517 --> 49:16.729
I bought a plot years ago for Pam and me
when plots was cheap.

49:16.753 --> 49:18.448
Camberwell New Cemetery.

49:21.058 --> 49:23.903
- You can go there now, can't you, Raysy?
- Camberwell?

49:23.927 --> 49:27.907
Australia. See Sue. See the
grandchildren you are supposed to have.

49:27.931 --> 49:31.711
- What's stopping you? You're a free man.
- He's right, Raysy.

49:31.735 --> 49:36.449
I mean, travel a little bit, see the world.
Stop off at Bangkok, spend a few quid.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.251
Small matter of the fare, Vic.

49:38.275 --> 49:42.209
Put one of your bets on.
I seem to recall it working before.

49:42.913 --> 49:46.041
Yeah. Should be a nice pub
down here, Vic.

49:46.950 --> 49:50.017
You know,
for that lunch you was talking about.

49:57.561 --> 50:00.189
"It's just the gypsy in my soul

50:01.698 --> 50:04.929
"If I am fancy-free

50:09.439 --> 50:10.667
"Fancy-free"

50:23.920 --> 50:27.378
<i>Doncaster. 15:30. Fancy Free.</i>

50:27.924 --> 50:30.620
<i>33-to-1. Trust me.</i>

50:31.895 --> 50:33.095
I trust you, Luck.

50:34.131 --> 50:35.931
I've got no choice, have I?

50:36.600 --> 50:38.745
- Here.
- Mr. Dodds, what have you done here?

50:38.769 --> 50:41.714
Remember that nurse Kelly
I introduced you to?

50:41.738 --> 50:43.916
- She reckons she fancies you.
- Mr. Dodds.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.452
- Would I lie to you, Lucky?
- Come on, come on.

50:46.476 --> 50:48.239
- 'Bye, Luck.
<i>- 'Bye, Jack.</i>

50:49.079 --> 50:51.257
- My mate Raysy fancies you.
- Oh, yeah?

50:51.281 --> 50:52.270
Yeah.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.697
Got something running in this?

50:57.721 --> 51:01.521
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't.
It's just, you know...

51:02.092 --> 51:04.137
...doesn't seem right, what with...

51:04.161 --> 51:06.186
Must fancy one or two though.

51:06.630 --> 51:08.697
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?

51:10.400 --> 51:13.494
Make the next one a short. Long short.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.349
- Is that all right for you?
- Thank you.

51:16.373 --> 51:19.786
Don't you get too excited, do you
hear me? It's a special favor.

51:19.810 --> 51:22.622
<i>...into the barrier alongside
number five, Fancy Free...</i>

51:22.646 --> 51:26.046
<i>...the inside runner
in the black and yellow colors.</i>

51:27.451 --> 51:28.461
<i>They're under...</i>

51:28.485 --> 51:31.784
- Caning it a bit, ain't we, Raysy?
- Yeah.

51:32.189 --> 51:33.349
<i>And they're off.</i>

51:33.890 --> 51:37.837
<i>Out of the barriers together. An even
start. Bunching up quickly over the rail.</i>

51:37.861 --> 51:40.206
<i>Saffron Street at the front
by a neck from Katchum.</i>

51:40.230 --> 51:41.908
<i>Western Ocean close on their heels.</i>

51:41.932 --> 51:45.211
<i>My goodness, Fancy Free hard up
against the back of the field...</i>

51:45.235 --> 51:47.480
<i>...clips the heels of Rebellion,
almost tripping.</i>

51:47.504 --> 51:50.049
<i>Fights for her footing.
By no means out of the race.</i>

51:50.073 --> 51:52.418
<i>Still looking to make it smooth
in a bunched field.</i>

51:52.442 --> 51:53.431
Go on.

51:53.510 --> 51:56.989
<i>There's no more than two lengths in it
as they head for the last bend...</i>

51:57.013 --> 51:58.691
<i>...with Saffron Street challenged...</i>

51:58.715 --> 52:01.027
<i>...by Western Ocean,
Katchum and Paco's Boy.</i>

52:01.051 --> 52:04.363
<i>Not far behind them Parting Moment,
Victory Art and Rebellion...</i>

52:04.387 --> 52:06.833
<i>...with the rest of the field
dropping back slightly.</i>

52:06.857 --> 52:08.668
<i>Falling away at the rear, Fancy Free.</i>

52:08.692 --> 52:10.970
<i>That early stumble
may have cost her dearly.</i>

52:10.994 --> 52:15.608
<i>It's a neck-and-neck battle between
Katchum, Paco's Boy and Saffron Street...</i>

52:15.632 --> 52:18.478
<i>...then Parting Moment,
Victory Art and Western Ocean.</i>

52:18.502 --> 52:21.180
<i>Then it's Rebellion, followed by...
Wait, what's this?</i>

52:21.204 --> 52:23.116
<i>Coming up with a late run, Fancy Free...</i>

52:23.140 --> 52:25.785
<i>...from being out of contention,
is flying into seventh place.</i>

52:25.809 --> 52:27.120
<i>Still a way from the leaders.</i>

52:27.144 --> 52:28.133
Go on.

52:28.211 --> 52:29.355
<i>Giving all she's got.</i>

52:29.379 --> 52:30.471
Do it for Amy.

52:32.349 --> 52:35.394
<i>Fancy Free is gathering in the leaders
as Victory Art and...</i>

52:35.418 --> 52:37.010
Come on, my son, go on.

52:37.087 --> 52:39.954
<i>Fancy Free is pulling
back the leaders now.</i>

52:44.027 --> 52:47.140
<i>It's a three-horse race
with Fancy Free looking the stronger.</i>

52:47.164 --> 52:49.976
<i>Fancy Free finds the extra, kicks away.
And clearly...</i>

52:50.000 --> 52:50.932
Come on.

53:00.744 --> 53:04.223
<i>Fancy Free, then Paco's Boy,
by half a length from Saffron Street...</i>

53:04.247 --> 53:05.725
<i>...a length from Katchum.</i>

53:05.749 --> 53:09.083
<i>What an incredible win
for the outsider Fancy Free!</i>

53:22.432 --> 53:23.833
Somebody's lucky day.

53:25.168 --> 53:29.798
Put the mortgage money on that,
treat yourself to a nice long holiday.

53:30.707 --> 53:34.754
<i>The official starting price for the
winner, 33-to-1, a fitting reward...</i>

53:34.778 --> 53:38.691
<i>...for the backers of Fancy Free for
their faith in the long shot which...</i>

53:38.715 --> 53:39.704
Yeah.

53:39.783 --> 53:42.061
<i>...came in impressively from nowhere...</i>

53:42.085 --> 53:43.329
<i>...with a miracle run...</i>

53:43.353 --> 53:44.253
It's Amy.

53:44.321 --> 53:47.188
<i>...to take out the
Doncaster Rémy Martin...</i>

53:49.059 --> 53:49.959
Ray?

53:51.061 --> 53:52.119
Jack's...

53:56.333 --> 53:57.265
Yeah.

54:01.972 --> 54:02.872
Yeah.

54:04.608 --> 54:05.508
Okay.

54:06.943 --> 54:08.943
It don't seem right somehow...

54:11.781 --> 54:14.215
...just to leave him here. I mean...

54:15.485 --> 54:19.966
...it don't seem right for us to go
and just leave him here on his own.

54:19.990 --> 54:21.724
Alone while we have lunch.

54:23.126 --> 54:24.593
It's up to you, Vince.

54:26.463 --> 54:30.397
No, you're right, Ray.
He should come with us, shouldn't he?

54:36.439 --> 54:39.966
Coffee. My Mandy said
she needed some coffee.

54:42.979 --> 54:47.159
Mandy doesn't know what a lucky girl
she is, having such a good husband.

54:47.183 --> 54:49.250
Mandy knows she's a lucky girl.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.055
That's Rochester Castle, yeah.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.371
Here you are, you take
care of Jack, Raysy.

54:58.395 --> 55:00.973
Three pints of best, please,
gorgeous, and...

55:00.997 --> 55:02.742
Want a drop of scotch, Vic?

55:02.766 --> 55:06.900
And a drop of scotch for him, please.
Any grub on the go, babe?

55:12.475 --> 55:16.989
- It's a crying shame that Jack ain't here.
- Yeah, he'd have appreciated it.

55:17.013 --> 55:21.894
- He shouldn't have rushed off like he did.
- No, daft of him. Still, it's a crying shame.

55:21.918 --> 55:26.866
If he was here, we wouldn't be, would
we? It's because he's not that we are.

55:26.890 --> 55:28.757
- Yeah, all the same.
- Yeah.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.659
He'd have appreciated it.

55:32.729 --> 55:35.396
And it's because of him that we're here.

55:36.800 --> 55:40.000
I mean, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

55:42.906 --> 55:44.669
I'm going to take a leak.

55:59.356 --> 56:00.966
<i>- Thanks, darling.
- All right, love.</i>

56:00.990 --> 56:01.890
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>

56:01.891 --> 56:03.269
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>

56:03.293 --> 56:04.317
My wife Amy.

56:04.527 --> 56:05.459
- Pam.
- Vic.

56:05.528 --> 56:06.528
Lenny. My wife.

56:06.596 --> 56:07.707
- Joan.
- Nice to meet you.

56:07.731 --> 56:10.910
If it wasn't for Lucky here,
I wouldn't be here, would I, Lucky?

56:10.934 --> 56:12.978
We call him Lucky, but
his real name's...

56:13.002 --> 56:15.027
Ray. Ray Johnson.

56:17.374 --> 56:20.308
Jack Dodds.
Small fellows have the advantage.

56:20.677 --> 56:23.956
Small fellows have the luck.
I hope you understand that.

56:23.980 --> 56:25.958
Less of a target for the enemy.

56:25.982 --> 56:29.228
Less weight to carry around
in this fucking frying pan. Mind you...

56:29.252 --> 56:31.263
...doesn't take away from my advantage.

56:31.287 --> 56:33.866
'Cause I could knock your block off
anytime I like.

56:33.890 --> 56:36.222
I hope you understand that.

56:37.494 --> 56:39.257
Hello, Ray.

56:39.796 --> 56:42.875
Hello, Lucky.
How did you get to be so small, anyway?

56:42.899 --> 56:46.299
- Did someone shrink you in the wash?
- Yeah, funny.

56:47.637 --> 56:48.681
Who'd have believed it?

56:48.705 --> 56:51.851
I meet Ray in Egypt,
and he comes from 'round the corner.

56:51.875 --> 56:52.933
You never!

56:54.210 --> 56:56.355
- You know Valetta Street?
- Yeah.

56:56.379 --> 56:58.624
You know the scrap merchants,
Frank Johnson's?

56:58.648 --> 57:00.240
- Yeah.
- My dad.

57:00.316 --> 57:03.028
- You know Dodds butcher's shop, Spring Road?
- Of course.

57:03.052 --> 57:07.252
Bet your ma buys her meat there, eh?
Best bangers in Bermondsey.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.867
Jack, get down!

57:20.003 --> 57:22.270
I owe him my life. Don't I, Lucky?

57:23.006 --> 57:24.166
Jack, get down!

57:25.475 --> 57:26.840
Oh, Jesus, Lucky...

57:27.477 --> 57:29.321
...if you hadn't have pulled me down...

57:29.345 --> 57:32.358
...I'd have copped that smack
in the wife's best friend.

57:32.382 --> 57:34.577
So the wife must be thankful?

57:35.151 --> 57:36.379
I am, Ray.

57:37.086 --> 57:37.986
I am.

57:38.655 --> 57:39.883
Least I could do.

57:40.457 --> 57:43.324
Least he could do.
Save my bollocks for me.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.272
Excuse my friend, won't you, Carol?

57:46.296 --> 57:48.355
What are the odds?

57:48.465 --> 57:51.877
Lucky here is the one to ask about that.
He's got a head for figures.

57:51.901 --> 57:55.514
You shouldn't be going into insurance,
Ray. You should've been a jockey.

57:55.538 --> 57:57.805
Too big for a jockey. Otherwise...

57:58.374 --> 58:01.400
So I've heard, Ray. So I've heard.

58:02.312 --> 58:03.506
Oh, yeah?

58:04.280 --> 58:05.180
To Jack.

58:05.748 --> 58:06.737
Jack.

58:09.085 --> 58:10.396
Can we have the same again?

58:10.420 --> 58:13.866
Not for me, Raysy. Unless you want
to find yourself another driver.

58:13.890 --> 58:17.986
I'll have a nice cup of coffee, darling.
And half a Corona.

58:18.928 --> 58:21.528
Oh, yeah, and I'll have a large cognac.

58:21.998 --> 58:26.045
Just as well Amy didn't come.
She wouldn't have planned on a piss-up.

58:26.069 --> 58:28.647
Is that tea or whisky
you're drinking there?

58:28.671 --> 58:29.660
Tea.

58:30.773 --> 58:33.040
He wouldn't begrudge us, would he?

58:33.910 --> 58:35.710
It's a long way to Margate.

58:47.690 --> 58:48.679
<i>I thought:</i>

58:48.758 --> 58:51.770
<i>"You ain't been nowhere,
and you ain't going nowhere."</i>

58:51.794 --> 58:54.139
Yeah, I saw his glove
where his face had been.

58:54.163 --> 58:57.409
And I saw stars. I actually saw
them like they say you do.

58:57.433 --> 59:00.212
Isn't it time to pack it in then?
Hang up the gloves.

59:00.236 --> 59:01.614
I could've won 50 smackers.

59:01.638 --> 59:04.383
You're seven years older
than when you last fought.

59:04.407 --> 59:05.533
Yeah, well.

59:06.910 --> 59:09.970
Gunner Tate,
middleweight, always pissed...

59:10.280 --> 59:12.414
"Always pissed and always late."

59:23.259 --> 59:23.393
- I was wondering, Vince...
- What was you wondering, Vic?

59:23.394 --> 59:26.505
- I was wondering, Vince...
- What was you wondering, Vic?

59:26.529 --> 59:30.943
I was wondering if we could pop over
to Chatham. See the war memorial.

59:30.967 --> 59:33.479
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Do you, Raysy?

59:33.503 --> 59:36.081
I'd have thought a man
in your line of business...

59:36.105 --> 59:38.505
...would've had enough of memorials.

59:38.675 --> 59:42.542
Nah, that's why we're here, ain't it?
To remember the dead.

59:42.612 --> 59:45.206
Yeah. That's what we're doing, Vince.

59:45.982 --> 59:48.473
- Mean a detour?
- We can do detours.

59:51.154 --> 59:54.021
It's my round, ain't it?
Same again, chaps?

59:55.291 --> 59:58.852
Vince, want another coffee?
Something to go with it?

1:00:00.396 --> 1:00:02.530
I don't know about you, Lenny...

1:00:03.333 --> 1:00:06.145
...but I'm driving down to Margate
to deliver something.

1:00:06.169 --> 1:00:07.880
That's why we're all here.

1:00:07.904 --> 1:00:10.950
Vic here wants a little stop on the way,
which I ain't against.

1:00:10.974 --> 1:00:13.686
Considering we're here
to remember the dead.

1:00:13.710 --> 1:00:17.823
It's just gone 14:15. If you want
to sit here all day drinking...

1:00:17.847 --> 1:00:21.594
...that's your business.
I'm going to the car, then to Margate.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:25.018
So if you ain't coming,
you'd better find a station.

1:00:31.194 --> 1:00:32.252
Tosshead.

1:00:32.328 --> 1:00:36.788
My old dad used to say, "You don't
dilly-dally with the deceased."

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:38.122
Shit.

1:00:42.772 --> 1:00:43.672
Hey!

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:47.003
Big Boy!

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:51.512
You forgot something, didn't you?

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:53.304
You forgot something.

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:00.520
You forgot this, didn't you?
You forgot your coffee.

1:01:01.190 --> 1:01:03.335
You may think you can do without us...

1:01:03.359 --> 1:01:07.426
...but you'd look a bloody fool
going to Margate without this.

1:01:21.811 --> 1:01:25.078
- He didn't say it was up no bleeding hill.
- Nah.

1:01:29.485 --> 1:01:30.713
Hold up, Vic.

1:01:33.189 --> 1:01:35.123
Come on then!

1:01:46.102 --> 1:01:47.433
The old buggers.

1:02:33.216 --> 1:02:34.808
Exalted company, Vince.

1:02:42.391 --> 1:02:45.237
<i>They used to think I
was bad luck at first.</i>

1:02:45.261 --> 1:02:46.455
Kept well away.

1:02:48.297 --> 1:02:52.164
It weren't long before they realized
how much I was needed.

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:54.536
<i>How important what I did was.</i>

1:02:58.274 --> 1:03:00.008
Helped me realize it, too.

1:03:01.177 --> 1:03:02.235
Accept it.

1:03:04.514 --> 1:03:06.648
Something to be proud of really.

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:27.536
Pam.

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:29.069
Vic.

1:03:29.772 --> 1:03:33.652
So what do you do then, Vic,
when you're not mucking about in boats?

1:03:33.676 --> 1:03:35.337
Ships, not boats.

1:03:39.549 --> 1:03:42.848
I'm in the undertaking trade.

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:46.451
Family business.

1:03:47.056 --> 1:03:50.219
Well, I never would have guessed, Vic.

1:03:51.460 --> 1:03:54.394
You'll never be out of
a job then, will you?

1:03:56.632 --> 1:03:59.965
So you'll be used to
handling bodies then.

1:04:03.139 --> 1:04:05.984
- You got yourself a winner here, Vic.
- Yeah, spoils of war.

1:04:06.008 --> 1:04:07.275
She's a lively one.

1:04:14.717 --> 1:04:19.451
- Bleeding hill nearly finished me.
- That's it, I'm packing up smoking.

1:04:28.698 --> 1:04:31.132
"Heligoland," where the hell's that?

1:04:33.369 --> 1:04:36.463
"Jutland, Doggerbank."

1:04:39.475 --> 1:04:40.806
Fucking Navy.

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.412
Fucking Army.

1:04:52.855 --> 1:04:53.844
Get down!

1:05:04.333 --> 1:05:06.130
Fucking tourists.

1:05:19.081 --> 1:05:20.948
<i>I fancy seeing the pyramids.</i>

1:05:22.151 --> 1:05:25.751
I fancy seeing the inside
of the nearest knocking shop.

1:05:26.088 --> 1:05:29.735
Pyramids are tombs, ain't they, Lucky?
Pyramids are for dead people.

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:32.455
Whereas, a tart's tackle...

1:05:34.030 --> 1:05:36.964
A mate gave me that.
Personal recommendation.

1:05:37.300 --> 1:05:42.167
- Maybe I could just stay here and...
- it's "Be-kind-to-your-pecker" Day.

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.584
- Yeah, maybe it's best if I...
- What's up?

1:05:45.608 --> 1:05:48.854
- Not so long since you seen the missus?
- I don't have no missus.

1:05:48.878 --> 1:05:50.004
Well, so, then?

1:05:50.846 --> 1:05:51.835
I have.

1:05:56.886 --> 1:05:59.687
Different place, different
rules, eh, Ray?

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:02.849
Lucky man.

1:06:05.061 --> 1:06:07.256
No, that's you, remember?

1:06:07.697 --> 1:06:09.164
<i>Please, come, come.</i>

1:06:09.231 --> 1:06:13.361
Please, look at it. Look at the girls.
Take your pick.

1:06:17.139 --> 1:06:18.806
Your first choice, Raysy.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:23.175
Just don't pick the one
with the big bristols on the right.

1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:25.490
They're laughing, Jack.

1:06:25.514 --> 1:06:27.714
What do you want them to do, cry?

1:06:30.252 --> 1:06:33.312
Good choice, Lucky. Your size.

1:06:36.792 --> 1:06:39.488
Take your pick. Come on, take your pick.

1:06:40.863 --> 1:06:42.524
No. No.

1:06:44.066 --> 1:06:45.863
Oh, no. Jesus.

1:06:47.803 --> 1:06:49.395
Oh, blimey.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:53.475
You lick me.

1:06:53.976 --> 1:06:55.000
"Lick"?

1:06:56.112 --> 1:06:58.910
Oh, like. Yeah.

1:06:59.548 --> 1:07:01.760
- Yeah, yeah.
- You've got ten minutes.

1:07:01.784 --> 1:07:02.808
Look at clock.

1:07:03.052 --> 1:07:05.319
What your friend think you go now?

1:07:05.488 --> 1:07:07.388
Oh, right. Yeah.

1:07:09.291 --> 1:07:10.191
Ray.

1:07:10.626 --> 1:07:11.718
Ray Johnson.

1:07:12.628 --> 1:07:13.528
Ray.

1:07:14.530 --> 1:07:15.622
How was it?

1:07:15.698 --> 1:07:18.944
Madame Yashmak here was just about
to come and prise you two apart.

1:07:18.968 --> 1:07:20.312
Very good. Very good.

1:07:20.336 --> 1:07:22.395
Little man, big "cuck."

1:07:26.776 --> 1:07:27.765
"Cuck"?

1:07:31.947 --> 1:07:34.426
- Go on then.
- You sure about this, Raysy?

1:07:34.450 --> 1:07:37.429
It's all right. I used to drive
the old man's horse and cart.

1:07:37.453 --> 1:07:39.765
But this ain't a horse and cart.
It's a camel.

1:07:39.789 --> 1:07:40.721
Trust me.

1:07:40.790 --> 1:07:43.657
I trust you, Raysy. I
ain't got no choice.

1:07:43.859 --> 1:07:46.487
Second ride of the day, Raysy!

1:08:04.814 --> 1:08:06.247
I'll catch you up.

1:08:06.515 --> 1:08:08.849
You go on, I'll catch you up there.

1:08:09.285 --> 1:08:10.309
Go on.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:17.392
What's all that about?

1:08:28.904 --> 1:08:29.734
Vincey.

1:08:29.805 --> 1:08:31.033
Let's go, lad.

1:08:35.311 --> 1:08:36.710
Come on, Vincey.

1:08:41.650 --> 1:08:44.930
If a butcher can get cost
on what he chucks in his wastage bin...

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:47.566
...and in his fat drawer,
he'd be happy, wouldn't he?

1:08:47.590 --> 1:08:48.633
He'd be laughing.

1:08:48.657 --> 1:08:50.535
What you must understand is that...

1:08:50.559 --> 1:08:53.805
...what comes into the shop
ain't what goes out of the shop.

1:08:53.829 --> 1:08:55.629
- Is fat wastage?
- Exactly.

1:08:56.265 --> 1:08:59.444
If you take away the weight of
the wastage from what you buy...

1:08:59.468 --> 1:09:02.180
...and you divide what's left
into what you paid for it...

1:09:02.204 --> 1:09:03.882
...that'll give you your real cost...

1:09:03.906 --> 1:09:06.818
...which is set against your takings.
Don't forget that...

1:09:06.842 --> 1:09:10.021
...because bone will cost you,
fat and shrinkage will cost you...

1:09:10.045 --> 1:09:12.424
...and not keeping your knife sharp
will cost you.

1:09:12.448 --> 1:09:16.027
You'll end up with measly scraps of meat
that ain't fit to sell to no one.

1:09:16.051 --> 1:09:18.530
And that'll cost you more than anything.

1:09:18.554 --> 1:09:21.566
You got to keep a constant eye
on wastage. Constant.

1:09:21.590 --> 1:09:23.590
- It's all about waste.
- Yeah.

1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:26.294
You're a good boy, Vincey.

1:09:26.595 --> 1:09:27.823
Good boy.

1:09:27.963 --> 1:09:29.089
Vincey.

1:09:29.265 --> 1:09:30.391
Uncle Ray!

1:09:34.570 --> 1:09:37.282
This is Uncle Ray's
favorite breakfast spot.

1:09:37.306 --> 1:09:39.618
Because he likes hanging
'round real men.

1:09:39.642 --> 1:09:41.200
My secret's out.

1:09:41.277 --> 1:09:43.811
And he also fancies the likes of that.

1:09:43.846 --> 1:09:45.924
It's a love from afar, eh, Lucky?

1:09:45.948 --> 1:09:49.682
- What are you looking at, you little rascal?
- Stop him.

1:10:10.306 --> 1:10:14.306
I don't know what you want to be doing
with all this in here.

1:10:16.178 --> 1:10:17.873
You're a good boy, Vince.

1:10:33.262 --> 1:10:34.929
What are you doing there?

1:10:35.030 --> 1:10:36.054
Keys.

1:10:36.265 --> 1:10:38.062
Sorry.

1:10:42.972 --> 1:10:44.735
- Raysy.
- What?

1:10:45.874 --> 1:10:46.966
I was wondering.

1:10:47.042 --> 1:10:48.153
- Wondering?
- Yeah.

1:10:48.177 --> 1:10:50.755
Jack never said nothing to you
about no money, did he?

1:10:50.779 --> 1:10:52.090
When he was... Before...

1:10:52.114 --> 1:10:54.693
He didn't say nothing
about no sum of money?

1:10:54.717 --> 1:10:57.518
- What sum of money?
- No, it don't matter.

1:10:59.989 --> 1:11:01.957
Say about £1,000.

1:11:02.024 --> 1:11:04.993
No, he never mentioned no money.

1:11:08.697 --> 1:11:10.775
Only we got to see Amy right, ain't we?

1:11:10.799 --> 1:11:11.699
Yes.

1:11:11.734 --> 1:11:14.268
- We got to see Amy right.
- Of course.

1:11:59.381 --> 1:12:00.473
Detour.

1:12:27.076 --> 1:12:29.044
Raysy, where's Jack?

1:12:53.068 --> 1:12:56.196
Jesus, what now?

1:12:56.505 --> 1:12:57.767
Search me.

1:13:04.179 --> 1:13:05.578
<i>Wicks' Farm.</i>

1:13:07.750 --> 1:13:10.350
That's where we first met, Jack and me.

1:13:11.019 --> 1:13:14.432
We weren't much more than kids
scratching for a few shillings.

1:13:14.456 --> 1:13:15.980
<i>Whatever we could get.</i>

1:13:19.795 --> 1:13:21.228
Like picking flowers.

1:13:22.331 --> 1:13:24.822
"He loves me. He loves me not.

1:13:25.434 --> 1:13:27.925
"He loves me. He loves me not."

1:13:28.003 --> 1:13:29.971
So what did you come for?

1:13:30.305 --> 1:13:33.365
Need the shillings. Same as everyone.

1:13:38.180 --> 1:13:41.247
So what do you do
when you're not picking hops?

1:13:43.285 --> 1:13:46.219
Well, that would be telling now,
wouldn't it?

1:13:46.622 --> 1:13:49.182
Picking up girls is what I remember.

1:13:49.558 --> 1:13:51.336
It was our holiday, weren't it?

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:53.385
Well, near as we could get.

1:13:53.729 --> 1:13:57.129
Felt like it.
Well, something different, weren't it?

1:13:57.232 --> 1:13:58.221
Yeah.

1:13:58.300 --> 1:13:59.978
Music and singing every night.

1:14:00.002 --> 1:14:03.448
Uncles, aunts, cousins...
Pickers from every which where.

1:14:03.472 --> 1:14:04.803
And the gypsies.

1:14:06.575 --> 1:14:08.099
The gypsies.

1:14:12.014 --> 1:14:14.281
You can put the spuds on here now.

1:14:14.483 --> 1:14:15.415
Cheryl...

1:14:15.584 --> 1:14:19.097
...quickly, can you go and see
if you can find the children?

1:14:19.121 --> 1:14:22.784
I got these from one of Wicks' hands.
You want them?

1:14:23.358 --> 1:14:24.325
Yeah.

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:28.560
If you want to help me top and tail
and string them.

1:14:30.566 --> 1:14:31.965
Yeah, all right.

1:14:37.673 --> 1:14:42.873
- There's a chair in here if you want it.
- No, I'll be all right on the grass.

1:14:49.051 --> 1:14:50.814
Chuck them in here.

1:14:52.321 --> 1:14:53.921
See if we can't fill it.

1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:39.500
Jack.

1:15:46.808 --> 1:15:47.934
Mummy.

1:15:55.884 --> 1:15:57.283
You're beautiful.

1:15:59.555 --> 1:16:00.749
Do you know that?

1:16:02.891 --> 1:16:04.324
You are beautiful.

1:16:05.894 --> 1:16:08.894
It's not what you expect
from a butcher's boy.

1:16:10.198 --> 1:16:13.065
And to know from his smile
that he means it.

1:16:15.237 --> 1:16:16.568
It turns you over.

1:16:19.274 --> 1:16:20.332
Yeah.

1:16:26.281 --> 1:16:27.748
Well, wait here then.

1:16:28.850 --> 1:16:30.650
You can take me for a walk.

1:17:03.852 --> 1:17:05.547
And that was our June.

1:17:13.195 --> 1:17:16.195
This ain't Margate.
It ain't what Jack wanted.

1:17:16.698 --> 1:17:18.165
What's he doing?

1:17:18.934 --> 1:17:20.333
You toerag!

1:17:21.069 --> 1:17:23.594
Last orders have to be respected.

1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:25.864
Pillock!

1:17:29.311 --> 1:17:32.109
No respect for Jack's wishes ever.

1:17:32.314 --> 1:17:35.977
I mean, he doesn't have any prior claim,
does he?

1:17:36.852 --> 1:17:39.548
I mean, he has no special rights.

1:17:39.621 --> 1:17:42.215
He's not kin, is he? He never was.

1:17:42.891 --> 1:17:44.256
Tosshead!

1:17:44.326 --> 1:17:47.386
You fucking toerag. Give me that.

1:17:47.462 --> 1:17:49.589
What are you doing? Get off!

1:17:54.302 --> 1:17:58.932
Always what Vincey wants, eh?
Some son you were, Big Boy.

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:01.075
Some son.

1:18:01.309 --> 1:18:04.403
There was no love lost, was there?

1:18:05.881 --> 1:18:06.870
Lenny...

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:08.826
...what are you doing?

1:18:08.850 --> 1:18:09.646
Come on.

1:18:09.751 --> 1:18:13.018
Too good for your old man?
Too good for all of us?

1:18:13.155 --> 1:18:14.645
That's for Sally.

1:18:14.723 --> 1:18:16.452
And that's for Jack.

1:18:17.693 --> 1:18:18.853
Yeah, you...

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:21.552
Lenny.

1:18:32.374 --> 1:18:34.706
Come on, Lenny. Come on.

1:18:37.012 --> 1:18:38.877
Fists. Come on, tosser.

1:18:38.947 --> 1:18:40.244
Fists, you pillock.

1:18:40.649 --> 1:18:41.616
Fists?

1:18:42.084 --> 1:18:44.075
Calm down, Lenny. Calm down.

1:18:48.957 --> 1:18:51.425
Just stop, Lenny.

1:18:53.228 --> 1:18:54.962
Come on. Got you, got you.

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:58.664
- Let me back at him.
- Leave it, Lenny, leave it!

1:19:04.706 --> 1:19:06.773
I wasn't going to throw it all.

1:19:07.642 --> 1:19:09.520
I was only going to throw a bit.

1:19:09.544 --> 1:19:10.875
It was only a bit.

1:19:11.513 --> 1:19:13.291
What are we going to do then?

1:19:13.315 --> 1:19:16.861
Was you going to stop every 10 minutes
so you can chuck a bit?

1:19:16.885 --> 1:19:19.263
You know, handful here, handful there.

1:19:19.287 --> 1:19:23.189
What does scatter mean?
What does the word "scatter" mean?

1:19:23.258 --> 1:19:25.158
What does it fucking mean?

1:19:28.063 --> 1:19:30.041
Should be ashamed of yourself.

1:19:30.065 --> 1:19:31.498
You pillock.

1:19:33.769 --> 1:19:35.259
This is where...

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:38.433
This is where...

1:19:44.513 --> 1:19:45.639
<i>See down there?</i>

1:19:45.714 --> 1:19:45.947
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.

1:19:45.948 --> 1:19:48.292
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.

1:19:48.316 --> 1:19:49.715
What's hop picking?

1:19:49.785 --> 1:19:53.785
It's what me and your mum did.
What we used to do down there.

1:19:54.456 --> 1:19:57.220
They say Kent is the garden of England.

1:19:59.261 --> 1:20:02.540
But it's like you've got to have
the country to have the town.

1:20:02.564 --> 1:20:03.764
See them orchards?

1:20:03.832 --> 1:20:06.577
Uncle Lenny couldn't have
no apples to sell, could he?

1:20:06.601 --> 1:20:08.068
See them sheep?

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:13.102
Come with me.

1:20:19.314 --> 1:20:20.406
You see...

1:20:21.316 --> 1:20:25.316
...with hops, it's not the hops
or how you pick them, it's...

1:20:25.887 --> 1:20:27.320
...who picks them.

1:20:27.722 --> 1:20:29.883
What I'm meaning to say is...

1:20:29.958 --> 1:20:33.621
...it wasn't your mum or me
who picked your hops.

1:20:35.730 --> 1:20:37.960
We picked someone else's hops.

1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:40.590
Her name's June.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:42.868
She's your sister.

1:20:44.039 --> 1:20:45.817
You have a sister called June.

1:20:45.841 --> 1:20:47.218
I ain't got a sister.

1:20:47.242 --> 1:20:50.376
- I ain't got a sister.
- Your sister's a loony!

1:20:50.445 --> 1:20:55.645
- Ain't got a sister. Ain't got a sister.
- Sister's a loony! Sister's a loony!

1:20:55.884 --> 1:20:58.352
Where is she? In a nuthouse?

1:21:11.833 --> 1:21:15.166
No, she's in a home.

1:21:16.171 --> 1:21:17.297
But, well...

1:21:18.373 --> 1:21:21.831
...actually, she's not
really your sister...

1:21:23.011 --> 1:21:24.945
...she's sort of your sister.

1:21:28.183 --> 1:21:29.514
Because, you see...

1:21:29.651 --> 1:21:32.997
...during the war,
the Jerries sent over these things...

1:21:33.021 --> 1:21:35.166
<i>...and when they ran out of fuel...</i>

1:21:35.190 --> 1:21:39.057
...they came down on the house.
They was called doodlebugs.

1:21:39.194 --> 1:21:40.491
"Doodlebug"?

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:43.922
<i>Yeah. A flying bomb.</i>

1:21:44.966 --> 1:21:45.955
<i>A B1...</i>

1:21:46.468 --> 1:21:49.269
<i>...and it flattened the
Pritchett's house.</i>

1:21:50.505 --> 1:21:53.804
Killed them all except you.

1:21:54.042 --> 1:21:55.270
It's a baby!

1:21:56.111 --> 1:21:57.601
Is it alive still?

1:21:58.046 --> 1:22:00.606
Amy rescued you. Otherwise...

1:22:02.250 --> 1:22:04.128
- Will you take it then?
- Yeah.

1:22:04.152 --> 1:22:06.019
Thanks, love. Right, got it?

1:22:07.956 --> 1:22:09.690
<i>You were born a Pritchett.</i>

1:22:10.859 --> 1:22:14.056
Vincent lan Pritchett.

1:22:18.033 --> 1:22:20.511
I came home from the war
and there you were.

1:22:20.535 --> 1:22:22.335
The son I never knew I had.

1:22:23.905 --> 1:22:26.396
So you're not really my dad?

1:23:24.866 --> 1:23:28.097
I've got a cloth in the car, Lenny.
And a brush.

1:23:28.570 --> 1:23:30.231
Here, hold Jack, Raysy.

1:23:31.339 --> 1:23:34.069
Now, we need the Canterbury road.

1:23:34.476 --> 1:23:36.476
Look for signs for Canterbury.

1:23:36.544 --> 1:23:37.875
- A28.
- Yeah.

1:23:38.546 --> 1:23:39.945
Canterbury?

1:23:40.115 --> 1:23:44.862
We might as well call in there as well.
Pop in to the bleeding cathedral.

1:23:44.886 --> 1:23:46.430
No, you're right, Lenny.

1:23:46.454 --> 1:23:49.166
Why shouldn't we take him
'round Canterbury Cathedral?

1:23:49.190 --> 1:23:50.968
Jack'd have loved that, wouldn't he?

1:23:50.992 --> 1:23:54.105
Yeah, good idea, Lenny. Nice gesture.
He'd be honored.

1:23:54.129 --> 1:23:57.274
I've never been to Canterbury Cathedral.
Not, you know, inside.

1:23:57.298 --> 1:23:58.230
Nah.

1:23:58.299 --> 1:24:01.299
Canterbury doesn't have a racecourse,
does it?

1:24:28.029 --> 1:24:29.553
Fourteen centuries.

1:24:30.031 --> 1:24:33.165
I mean, I have a think about that,
14 centuries.

1:24:35.437 --> 1:24:37.735
They got kings and queens in here.

1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:41.641
Makes me feel humble. My line of work.

1:24:41.810 --> 1:24:42.902
Yeah.

1:24:43.878 --> 1:24:45.812
Got saints and cardinals.

1:24:46.714 --> 1:24:49.493
That's where Becket got done.
Up there on them steps.

1:24:49.517 --> 1:24:52.997
"...full-length view
from behind Saint Augustine's chair...

1:24:53.021 --> 1:24:58.235
"...from the thirteenth century, and a copy
of Augustine's original Saxon cathedral...

1:24:58.259 --> 1:25:02.860
"...of sins completed behind the
transepts by William the Englishman."

1:25:03.531 --> 1:25:05.598
Well, this is lovely, isn't it?

1:25:06.534 --> 1:25:09.731
- You all right, Lucky?
- Yeah, give me a mo.

1:25:10.972 --> 1:25:13.106
What, was I rabbiting on, was I?

1:25:13.441 --> 1:25:14.840
No, it's not that.

1:25:15.043 --> 1:25:18.206
Here, take Jack for a bit.
I'll catch you up.

1:25:18.279 --> 1:25:20.958
- All right. Sit there and take it easy.
- Yeah.

1:25:20.982 --> 1:25:24.382
Come on. I think the Black Prince
is here somewhere.

1:25:24.486 --> 1:25:26.454
Whatever you say, Big Boy.

1:25:26.521 --> 1:25:30.150
<i>I mean, there's only me to consider now,
ain't there?</i>

1:25:30.291 --> 1:25:34.972
Yeah, now all your women have run off to
places named "Syd" something or other.

1:25:34.996 --> 1:25:38.008
Well, with them gone,
I don't need it, do I? So...

1:25:38.032 --> 1:25:41.011
...when Henderson offered me
the promotion, I told him:

1:25:41.035 --> 1:25:43.469
"I don't need a leg up, thanks.

1:25:43.538 --> 1:25:48.237
"I'd prefer two days less work
for a quarter less wages."

1:25:48.977 --> 1:25:51.722
- Are you having a cup of tea or not?
- Yeah.

1:25:51.746 --> 1:25:56.080
It's all right for some. Some of
us have to make an honest living.

1:26:01.523 --> 1:26:02.956
All right, darling?

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.252
So...

1:26:07.896 --> 1:26:10.163
...I'll have many a free Thursday.

1:26:11.366 --> 1:26:13.566
If ever you want me to drive you.

1:26:14.536 --> 1:26:15.833
To see June.

1:26:16.437 --> 1:26:19.571
Well, that's a long old bus ride
you have to do.

1:26:19.974 --> 1:26:22.574
The Horses can do without me for a day.

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:26.279
And besides, it's right near Epsom.

1:26:31.386 --> 1:26:33.120
And maybe I could come in.

1:26:35.857 --> 1:26:37.256
And see June.

1:26:44.532 --> 1:26:45.876
Yeah, all right, Ray.

1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:47.595
Here you are, hold Jack.

1:26:47.702 --> 1:26:49.103
"Fought at Cressi..."

1:26:49.137 --> 1:26:51.081
He sounds like a proper soldier boy.

1:26:51.105 --> 1:26:55.064
"Married to Joan, the
Fair Maid of Kent."

1:26:55.410 --> 1:26:58.088
Here, Lenny, look,
someone else got spliced to a Joan.

1:26:58.112 --> 1:27:00.913
Doesn't look like he
smiled much, does it?

1:27:01.716 --> 1:27:03.377
"Fought at Cressi...

1:27:03.685 --> 1:27:06.153
"...and Poitiers..."

1:27:07.622 --> 1:27:10.634
Good afternoon, Vic Tucker,
funeral director...

1:27:10.658 --> 1:27:12.303
...for the late Mr. Adams.

1:27:12.327 --> 1:27:13.885
Oh, yes, Mr. Tucker.

1:27:15.330 --> 1:27:16.592
One moment.

1:27:17.899 --> 1:27:20.766
Do you have a June Dodds here
by any chance?

1:27:20.969 --> 1:27:23.164
Been with us almost 30 years.

1:27:25.940 --> 1:27:27.100
Down there...

1:27:27.408 --> 1:27:30.075
...out the door, third door on the left.

1:27:30.278 --> 1:27:31.267
Thank you.

1:28:09.851 --> 1:28:13.831
Right. I say we take a quick gander
at the cloisters and make a move.

1:28:13.855 --> 1:28:16.656
- Eh, Lenny?
- All right, Big Boy. Lead on.

1:28:30.705 --> 1:28:32.570
<i>"If I am fancy-free</i>

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:32.674
"And love to wander

1:28:32.675 --> 1:28:34.642
"And love to wander

1:28:34.709 --> 1:28:36.843
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

1:28:38.713 --> 1:28:42.293
I met you the same time as I met Jack.
Did you know that?

1:28:42.317 --> 1:28:45.717
- What, in the desert?
- Yeah, in the desert. Egypt.

1:28:47.588 --> 1:28:48.953
I saw your photo.

1:28:53.428 --> 1:28:55.962
<i>I knew the first time we actually met.</i>

1:28:56.431 --> 1:28:58.765
In the stationary Coach and Horses?

1:28:59.434 --> 1:29:00.958
- I could tell.
- Yeah?

1:29:01.035 --> 1:29:03.235
Just by the way you looked at me.

1:29:04.372 --> 1:29:06.972
We're not going to see June today, Amy.

1:29:08.309 --> 1:29:10.509
I've packed a picnic in the back.

1:29:14.248 --> 1:29:15.943
Whatever you say, Ray.

1:29:18.753 --> 1:29:20.744
<i>And it's Blackbird leading...</i>

1:29:21.255 --> 1:29:23.122
Can't see which one's ahead.

1:29:24.258 --> 1:29:25.953
Oh, I can't see.

1:29:26.027 --> 1:29:29.827
Come on, Malfi. Come on, Malfi!

1:29:29.897 --> 1:29:31.057
Come on!

1:29:31.366 --> 1:29:32.424
Oh, my God!

1:29:32.500 --> 1:29:34.058
Come on, Malfi!

1:29:34.135 --> 1:29:36.729
Come on! Go on, Malfi!

1:29:36.804 --> 1:29:40.433
- Come on!
- Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

1:29:41.843 --> 1:29:42.901
She's won!

1:29:47.115 --> 1:29:48.047
Ray!

1:29:49.016 --> 1:29:50.074
We won!

1:29:50.318 --> 1:29:52.377
Come on, picnic time.

1:29:54.655 --> 1:29:57.668
- When do we get the money?
- Honest Harry's over there.

1:29:57.692 --> 1:30:00.571
That was so exciting.
I've never won anything before, Ray.

1:30:00.595 --> 1:30:03.396
Oh, my God.
Come on, get in the van. Quick.

1:30:04.132 --> 1:30:05.463
Come on, in you go.

1:30:12.340 --> 1:30:13.739
You took me places.

1:30:15.576 --> 1:30:17.476
I loved traveling about.

1:30:19.046 --> 1:30:20.274
Our picnics.

1:30:23.451 --> 1:30:25.262
It's just like home, isn't it?

1:30:25.286 --> 1:30:26.617
Home from home.

1:30:26.754 --> 1:30:29.655
Ray, you're such a lovely man.

1:30:31.793 --> 1:30:33.488
You're a lucky man.

1:30:34.629 --> 1:30:36.763
You're a little ray of sunshine.

1:30:39.734 --> 1:30:41.601
You're a little ray of hope.

1:31:08.029 --> 1:31:08.961
Here.

1:31:14.368 --> 1:31:16.836
<i>I still cherish those weeks, Ray.</i>

1:31:17.605 --> 1:31:18.936
Six, wasn't it?

1:31:20.041 --> 1:31:21.099
Yeah.

1:31:24.111 --> 1:31:26.089
Was a pity they had to stop, wasn't it?

1:31:26.113 --> 1:31:29.276
- Well, I couldn't not see June, could I?
- No.

1:31:30.017 --> 1:31:32.596
Then with Vincey coming home
from the Army and...

1:31:32.620 --> 1:31:36.283
Yeah. It meant a lot to you,
Vincey coming home.

1:31:36.891 --> 1:31:38.859
And seeing June.

1:31:41.963 --> 1:31:43.963
And we couldn't do it to Jack.

1:31:45.132 --> 1:31:46.258
Could we?

1:31:49.971 --> 1:31:51.438
He loved me, Ray.

1:31:53.207 --> 1:31:55.341
No one else for him, I swear it.

1:31:57.144 --> 1:31:59.704
- So, how was it?
- All right.

1:32:00.515 --> 1:32:01.916
<i>Couldn't love June...</i>

1:32:02.517 --> 1:32:04.178
<i>...but he did love me.</i>

1:32:08.756 --> 1:32:10.223
You're beautiful, Amy.

1:32:11.659 --> 1:32:13.251
Still beautiful.

1:32:14.996 --> 1:32:18.432
Vince is bloody 40,
and you're still beautiful.

1:32:20.902 --> 1:32:23.046
What do you say I take you dancing?

1:32:23.070 --> 1:32:26.737
- Dancing?
- Yeah, I want to be the envy of one and all.

1:32:29.443 --> 1:32:30.501
Good luck.

1:32:30.578 --> 1:32:32.890
We haven't been dancing in a long while,
have we?

1:32:32.914 --> 1:32:35.926
Well, I don't have enough fingers
and toes to count the years.

1:32:35.950 --> 1:32:37.144
Thirty years.

1:32:44.358 --> 1:32:46.952
- Oh, Jack.
- Come here. Come here.

1:32:51.866 --> 1:32:52.958
You all right?

1:33:02.577 --> 1:33:03.942
Butchery Lane?

1:33:04.278 --> 1:33:06.356
Now that's got to be worth a look,
don't it?

1:33:06.380 --> 1:33:08.007
Be bloody rude not to.

1:33:08.082 --> 1:33:11.813
There you are. Thought we'd lost you.

1:33:12.353 --> 1:33:15.288
I think a pint wouldn't hurt, would it?

1:33:22.296 --> 1:33:24.963
<i>Yeah, he's a lovely man, your Uncle Ray.</i>

1:33:27.201 --> 1:33:29.192
Little ray of sunshine.

1:33:33.507 --> 1:33:34.974
Did you miss me, June?

1:33:37.812 --> 1:33:42.079
Did you even know I weren't here
for those six weeks that summer?

1:33:43.117 --> 1:33:45.347
Out of how many in 50 years?

1:33:49.490 --> 1:33:53.187
If you tot up the hours
we've actually spent together...

1:33:56.797 --> 1:33:59.131
...probably only been about a year.

1:34:00.067 --> 1:34:03.001
It's not much
for mother and daughter, is it?

1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:08.035
Maybe he was right, Jack.

1:34:10.311 --> 1:34:11.471
Your dad.

1:34:13.414 --> 1:34:14.813
I did choose you.

1:34:17.885 --> 1:34:21.219
He couldn't choose you.
He couldn't choose his own.

1:34:22.690 --> 1:34:26.290
Not even at the end, did he
want to know, "How's June?"

1:34:27.294 --> 1:34:29.421
<i>Not even, "Send June my love."</i>

1:34:34.402 --> 1:34:38.602
<i>You would have loved him though, June.
You would have loved him.</i>

1:34:45.179 --> 1:34:46.942
Still beautiful, Amy.

1:34:52.787 --> 1:34:53.947
Still.

1:35:00.127 --> 1:35:01.424
<i>Journey's end.</i>

1:35:01.962 --> 1:35:05.420
Hallelujah. Gasping for a pee.

1:35:06.701 --> 1:35:08.293
This is Marine Terrace.

1:35:10.137 --> 1:35:14.198
Marine Terrace, Margate.
The Golden Mile.

1:35:16.444 --> 1:35:18.435
'Course it's out of season.

1:35:20.614 --> 1:35:22.214
Dreamland's still there.

1:35:39.867 --> 1:35:41.129
Where's the pier?

1:35:41.268 --> 1:35:43.046
You're looking at it, Raysy.

1:35:43.070 --> 1:35:47.284
- What, that thing? Well, that ain't a pier.
- Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."

1:35:47.308 --> 1:35:50.420
- No, that's a harbor wall.
- Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."

1:35:50.444 --> 1:35:53.223
There used to be the jetty
that looked like a pier.

1:35:53.247 --> 1:35:54.558
Where the steamboats came in.

1:35:54.582 --> 1:35:55.674
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:35:55.783 --> 1:35:57.461
Well, it sounds reasonable.

1:35:57.485 --> 1:36:00.318
So where's the other thing, the jetty?

1:36:00.387 --> 1:36:02.833
Well, that got swept away in about...

1:36:02.857 --> 1:36:05.621
The storms, 1970, something, yeah.

1:36:05.693 --> 1:36:06.717
Yeah.

1:36:06.794 --> 1:36:11.026
I remember Amy saying,
"Did you hear about Margate Jetty?"

1:36:14.502 --> 1:36:15.560
Yeah.

1:36:28.949 --> 1:36:32.329
- Not good scattering weather.
- Well, that depends how you look at it.

1:36:32.353 --> 1:36:34.344
- Fair old wind.
- Yeah.

1:36:35.689 --> 1:36:37.884
Vic, we don't need the bag now.

1:36:43.697 --> 1:36:45.665
Here, you hold him, Ray.

1:36:48.736 --> 1:36:50.101
Well, where's Lenny?

1:36:50.171 --> 1:36:51.982
Has he gone for a paddle and all?

1:36:52.006 --> 1:36:55.418
Oh, God, look at him.
He ain't even done his trousers up.

1:36:55.442 --> 1:36:56.500
All right?

1:36:56.811 --> 1:36:58.142
Come on.

1:36:58.412 --> 1:36:59.709
He's off.

1:37:04.185 --> 1:37:06.016
Come on, you soppy sod.

1:37:11.692 --> 1:37:14.559
It ain't weather for
the beach, I tell you.

1:37:14.695 --> 1:37:16.595
Mad Gunner Tate.

1:37:16.664 --> 1:37:20.760
Mad Jack Dodds. You think he whisked
this up special, do you?

1:37:23.270 --> 1:37:25.465
- Well.
- Well.

1:37:25.906 --> 1:37:27.396
<i>Well, June...</i>

1:37:27.842 --> 1:37:28.409
...they must be there by now.

1:37:28.410 --> 1:37:30.344
...they must be there by now.

1:37:31.212 --> 1:37:32.372
Margate.

1:37:34.014 --> 1:37:35.447
Jack in the sea.

1:37:37.251 --> 1:37:38.684
Or about to be.

1:37:41.889 --> 1:37:43.186
Goodbye, Jack.

1:37:47.695 --> 1:37:48.992
Goodbye, June.

1:37:52.766 --> 1:37:53.858
Oh, June.

1:38:01.442 --> 1:38:03.920
We've got to make our own lives now,
June...

1:38:03.944 --> 1:38:07.724
...without each other.
We've got to go our own separate ways.

1:38:07.748 --> 1:38:10.082
I've got to think of my own future.

1:38:11.151 --> 1:38:14.618
Now 50 years is beyond the call
for bringing up baby.

1:38:18.025 --> 1:38:21.204
Most I've ever wanted,
the most I've ever hoped for...

1:38:21.228 --> 1:38:24.407
...in those 50 years, I haven't
asked for the earth, believe me...

1:38:24.431 --> 1:38:28.165
...is that you should've looked at me
just once and said:

1:38:28.235 --> 1:38:29.259
"Mom."

1:38:33.874 --> 1:38:38.408
I couldn't have just stopped coming
without saying this to your face.

1:38:41.615 --> 1:38:43.082
Goodbye, June.

1:39:19.153 --> 1:39:20.897
<i>If there was anything other than...</i>

1:39:20.921 --> 1:39:22.988
...blind chance in the world...

1:39:23.290 --> 1:39:26.624
...if we could see
and choose in the first place...

1:39:27.428 --> 1:39:29.762
...you'd be riding Derby winners...

1:39:29.797 --> 1:39:34.234
...Lenny'd be the middleweight champion
and I'd be Doctor Kildare.

1:39:35.869 --> 1:39:36.893
And Vic?

1:39:36.971 --> 1:39:40.463
Well, I reckon Vic's
where he wants to be.

1:39:40.708 --> 1:39:42.938
I reckon Vic's got it sorted out.

1:39:43.010 --> 1:39:44.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:39:45.679 --> 1:39:48.045
If you ever get the chance...

1:39:48.115 --> 1:39:50.948
...Raysy. If you ever get the option...

1:39:52.419 --> 1:39:53.886
...you go first.

1:39:54.755 --> 1:39:56.985
It's the carrying on that's hard.

1:39:58.559 --> 1:39:59.821
Ending...

1:40:00.561 --> 1:40:01.895
...it ain't nothing.

1:40:03.897 --> 1:40:06.364
That ain't an option I've got, is it?

1:40:06.633 --> 1:40:08.328
I mean, if anyone has.

1:40:08.402 --> 1:40:10.870
Seeing as it's just me.

1:40:11.972 --> 1:40:13.269
You never know.

1:40:15.509 --> 1:40:18.672
Still, I reckon I'm lucky.

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:21.371
Nah. I'm Lucky.

1:40:24.218 --> 1:40:26.413
It'll be harder for Amy.

1:40:26.987 --> 1:40:27.954
Yeah.

1:40:28.022 --> 1:40:30.222
She'll need looking after, Raysy.

1:40:30.257 --> 1:40:31.157
Yeah.

1:40:32.659 --> 1:40:34.786
We've got to see Amy right.

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.367
It's all a gamble, isn't it?

1:40:41.402 --> 1:40:42.460
Yeah.

1:40:43.837 --> 1:40:45.134
Yeah, it is.

1:40:47.708 --> 1:40:48.970
Just a gamble.

1:40:57.184 --> 1:40:59.318
<i>It's going to be all right, Amy.</i>

1:41:01.622 --> 1:41:04.622
Jack's made sure
you're going to be all right.

1:41:05.359 --> 1:41:09.826
That 20 grand. There's no problem.
There's nothing hanging over you.

1:41:11.265 --> 1:41:14.865
You can have that bungalow in Margate
if you wanted it.

1:41:16.837 --> 1:41:18.896
Or... Maybe...

1:41:20.774 --> 1:41:24.471
...you might go on a
little trip down under.

1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:29.749
Think you'd fancy that, down under?

1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:35.287
Australia's a long way, Ray.

1:41:35.355 --> 1:41:36.413
Oh, yeah.

1:41:37.991 --> 1:41:40.325
But then I do like traveling about.

1:41:41.995 --> 1:41:43.019
Well...

1:41:49.069 --> 1:41:50.559
Come here.

1:41:54.541 --> 1:41:57.305
- Here, Vince. Come here.
- What?

1:41:59.446 --> 1:42:01.175
About your £1,000.

1:42:01.515 --> 1:42:02.504
I've got it.

1:42:02.583 --> 1:42:03.709
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:42:04.551 --> 1:42:06.610
I'll explain when we get home.

1:42:08.355 --> 1:42:09.322
Yeah.

1:42:10.557 --> 1:42:12.388
See Amy all right, too.

1:42:14.128 --> 1:42:15.117
Yeah.

1:42:17.865 --> 1:42:21.211
I think Amy made the right decision
after all, don't you?

1:42:21.235 --> 1:42:22.224
Yeah.

1:42:25.606 --> 1:42:26.698
God help us.

1:42:26.773 --> 1:42:29.173
- Not far.
- Nearly there now, Jack.

1:42:40.521 --> 1:42:41.715
Here we are.

1:42:44.424 --> 1:42:45.618
Over here.

1:42:48.762 --> 1:42:51.641
Not too near the edge.
The wind will take him.

1:42:51.665 --> 1:42:53.223
Let the wind take him.

1:42:53.300 --> 1:42:55.967
Here, keep your hands as dry as you can.

1:43:00.841 --> 1:43:02.638
Right. Come on then.

1:43:12.653 --> 1:43:14.416
Go on, Vince. Come on.

1:43:18.825 --> 1:43:19.849
Goodbye, Jack.

1:43:19.927 --> 1:43:20.827
Yeah.

1:43:21.328 --> 1:43:22.420
'Bye, Jack.

1:43:22.496 --> 1:43:23.428
'Bye, Jack.

1:43:34.841 --> 1:43:36.570
- 'Bye, Jack.
- 'Bye, Dad.

1:43:36.643 --> 1:43:38.008
Bye-bye, Jack.

1:43:42.382 --> 1:43:43.474
Go on, Ray.

1:43:44.051 --> 1:43:45.313
Goodbye, Jack.

1:43:45.686 --> 1:43:46.880
'Bye, Jack.

1:43:48.021 --> 1:43:49.318
Ta-ta, mate.

1:44:34.501 --> 1:44:36.025
Dry work, eh, lads?

1:44:37.037 --> 1:44:40.200
Yeah, a pint wouldn't be out of place,
would it?

1:44:40.274 --> 1:44:43.072
Jack'd expect nothing less.

1:44:43.543 --> 1:44:44.373
Here.

1:44:44.444 --> 1:44:47.190
Drinks are on me.
If that's all right with you, Lenny.

1:44:47.214 --> 1:44:48.340
Well done, Vic.

1:44:48.415 --> 1:44:51.350
If you're shouting, Big Boy, I'm there.

1:44:51.418 --> 1:44:53.682
Till the last bell rings.

1:44:53.754 --> 1:44:56.699
Be my pleasure, Gunner.
Jack would expect nothing less.

1:44:56.723 --> 1:44:57.849
Yeah.
