Of course.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.421
I'll be there, okay?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.622
Thanks, Mr. Lewis.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.563
What can I do
for you, Daniella?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.497

04:10.417 --> 04:11.967
I-I didn't see anything.

You don't have
to worry about him.

me write you a pass, okay?

04:27.534 --> 04:28.967
We'll talk later.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.401
Let's go, now. Get your stuff.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.539

are the place

I guess you want a
six-month summer vacation.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.281
Get suspended?

04:42.283 --> 04:43.866
No sir.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.450
I could expel you
for this, young man.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.686
But if you can grow
up for five seconds,

04:47.688 --> 04:50.055
apologize and shake hands,

04:50.057 --> 04:52.457
I'll talk it over
with your parents.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.625
It's your decision.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.697
Sorry.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.699
It's cool.

05:02.069 --> 05:05.470
Alright. Get a
pass from the desk.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.715
Don't quote me, but
paddles were invented

05:16.717 --> 05:18.583
for kids like that.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.485
Maybe you shut
them up for a while.

05:22.723 --> 05:26.425
Harold, can I ask how
things are looking for me?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.328
Enjoy the uncertainty.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.331
After tenure, you'll
be stuck here forever.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.405
TODD: Are you sure Tim
threw the first punch?

05:40.407 --> 05:42.741
Yeah, one of my
student witnessed it.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.243
He's honest.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.745
Tim actually picks
on him a little bit.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.747
Well that's great, it just
turned scouting season, too.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.715
Idiot.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.350
Straight at him, Tim!

05:58.759 --> 05:59.758
I've got to get back to work.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.393
Yeah.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.732
You can come inside, you know.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.367
I didn't want
to bother anyone.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.135
We're not wildlife.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.504
Well, except for Tim Cooper.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.877
You should go sit
next to Daniella.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.514
Come on, give her some
pointers on her homework.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.727
Hey, um. Mr. Lewis said it
would be okay if I came up here

06:35.729 --> 06:37.396
to take some pictures?

06:37.698 --> 06:38.830
Yeah, that's fine.

That's a really cool camera.

but I'm the only one

06:58.585 --> 07:00.202
who knows how to use it.

07:00.203 --> 07:01.820
Because you're
like a genius, right?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.922
You're probably
smarter than me.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.758
That's so stupid.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.793
No it's not.

saying that we were

okay, but it's not like

07:36.223 --> 07:37.472
I ever touched you.

07:37.473 --> 07:38.724
God, no, you just
punched holes in walls.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.175
That happened one time.

07:40.176 --> 07:41.626
I was terrified and you...

I am, I'm done, I'm done.

planning on cutting out

13:10.924 --> 13:14.058
then he is a murderer, right?

Absolutely.

A murderer.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.566

13:22.202 --> 13:24.202
Isn't Shylock also a victim?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.855
What do you guys think?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.730
Anyone?

13:51.731 --> 13:53.232
Claims of obsolescence
have been levied against

13:53.233 --> 13:55.534
English teachers for years.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.836
We need to prove that we
have practical utility.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.171
There are many discussions
in the department about that,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.105
as you know.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.842
Many discussions.

James is also
working on a novel.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.614
Really?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.217
Yeah, it's about a man
who's going to lose his tether

14:11.218 --> 14:13.284
on reality after his
wife passes away.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.921
Not autobiographical, I hope.

14:16.923 --> 14:17.956
No, not at all.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.259
I understand you
witnessed an altercation

14:21.261 --> 14:24.128
between Tim Cooper and
another boy earlier this week?

14:24.130 --> 14:27.165
Yeah, just outside
of my classroom.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.301
WARREN: You reported
that Tim instigated?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.271
Another student
witnessed the start of it.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.273
You didn't
witness it yourself?

14:36.142 --> 14:39.444
No, but I assure you
the student's trustworthy.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.279
It's Preston Walsh.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.982
I'm sure he is.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.069
Thank you, James.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.987
I think that about
does it for this round.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.190
Okay, thank you.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.994
Oh no, it's okay.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.905
What was that?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.906
Juan's parents called
Warren out of the blue

15:08.909 --> 15:10.909
and asked him to
show mercy on Tim.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.211
I have a hard
time picturing that.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.479
No suspension, no detention.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.897
Warren's call.

15:15.898 --> 15:17.314
So now I'm in
Warren's crosshairs?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.919
Everything's fine.
This isn't Kafka.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.435
I should say hi.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.708

of studying to do?

15:43.710 --> 15:44.943
Hi.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.378
Hey. How are you?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.347
Good.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.516
Oh, these are my parents.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.151

15:54.087 --> 15:54.986

16:04.297 --> 16:06.331

to rain on his lawn.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.500
He probably paid
that family off.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.237

think about that.

with you and Sarah?

I'll open a wine bar,

16:36.196 --> 16:38.096

16:39.065 --> 16:40.131
I don't get it.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.299
Oh, because you age the wine.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.001
That's very funny.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.105
You know her?

16:47.106 --> 16:48.205

make you feel loved,

17:02.921 --> 17:04.087

17:04.089 --> 17:05.123
Oh!

17:07.027 --> 17:10.028
Do you know James Lewis,
from the English department?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.346
No, hi.

17:11.347 --> 17:12.663
Hi, it's so good to meet you.

17:12.664 --> 17:13.980
Oh, what happened
to your hand?

17:13.981 --> 17:15.300
Oh, just bumped
it moving furniture.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.434
It's stupid.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.336
Weak bones.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.271
We've known each other
since college, actually.

17:20.272 --> 17:23.273
I actually brought James
here from the city.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.042
Got him a job.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.810
And now he's facing
judgment soon.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.945
Tenure.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.080
Oh, wow! Congratulations!

17:29.082 --> 17:31.066
That's great.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.052
Yeah, we'll see. I feel like
Warren's got it out for me.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.353
Well, he wouldn't have
kept you around this long

17:34.354 --> 17:36.087
if he didn't want
you here, right?

17:36.088 --> 17:37.823
That's what people said
about my ex-wife, and...

17:37.824 --> 17:41.359
Ah, I would not have
said that out loud.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.629
Anyways, there's a,

17:44.631 --> 17:45.931
I've got to get back to work.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.232
It was great to
meet you, thanks.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.533
Yeah, it was a
fun conversation.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.835
Go get them.
It was nice meeting you.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.069
You too!

17:51.071 --> 17:52.437
Charmer.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.804
He, he's sweet.

17:53.805 --> 17:55.171
I mean, he
mentioned his ex-wife

17:55.175 --> 17:56.408
within ten seconds
of us meeting.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.209
I think that's an
Olympic record.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.178
He's bitter-sweet.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.347
Hey, Mr. Lewis.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.399
Hi Tim.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.451
Good to see you again James.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.484
Mr. Cooper.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.386
Bernie, please.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.855
We don't want to
take much of your time,

18:09.856 --> 18:11.656
but Tim would like
to apologize to you

18:11.658 --> 18:13.257
for his behavior.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.393
Yeah, I'm really
sorry about that.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.262
Won't happen again.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.397
I appreciate that, Tim.

18:19.399 --> 18:23.234
Feel like you still
owe an apology to Juan.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.503
Definitely Preston, for
what you said to him.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.272
Yeah, I'll talk to them.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.441
That's great.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.977
Alright Tim, thanks.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.512
Give us a minute, will you?

18:35.515 --> 18:39.150
So, about our pain
in the ass kid.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.486
Julie and I are deeply
concerned about his grades.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.354
Especially in your class.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.388
Just stay on him.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.125
And then call me, anytime.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.910
Well we certainly
appreciate that.

18:48.911 --> 18:50.694
Yes. Oh, and congratulations
on your tenure.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.430
I hear it's almost complete.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.367
You certainly
do your homework.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.634
No, it's nothing.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.903

kid's in your class.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.763
You know.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.623
We would love to put
in a good word for you,

19:01.624 --> 19:03.483
and you know, if
there's any attention

19:03.484 --> 19:05.724
that you could pay to Tim, to
help him keep his grade up?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.246
It would mean the world to us.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.149

20:06.573 --> 20:08.606

here the other day,

20:08.608 --> 20:09.608
and I thought,

20:10.476 --> 20:12.276
just saying hello.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.246
Hey.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.418

20:32.498 --> 20:33.498

20:36.502 --> 20:38.636

leave him alone.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.639
Maybe you should tell me
what his cum tastes like.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.247
I'm so sorry.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.248
He's a jerk.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.283
It's not your fault.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.651
No, for what he said.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.621

20:56.623 --> 20:58.656
Well no, but, sorry.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.361
Okay, uh.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.895
You're parked over here too?

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:49.930
No, I'm a floor
up, where are you at?

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.699
This is me right here.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:56.671
Drive safe, okay, Tim.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:57.738
Yeah.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.773
Thanks.

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:11.686
Hey, it looks like someone
was having some fun out here.

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.220
You should come and have a look.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:23.831
What the fuck,
are you kidding me?

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.967
Security's terrible here.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:28.736
You have a spare?

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:31.839
I don't have two!
Right, yes,

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.108
I guess that's why I'm
an English teacher.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.877
You know where I can
get a tow around here?

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.280
JAMES: Yeah, I know
a couple of places,

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:40.081
it's gonna really
cost you though.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.116
I'll just put it on my card.

01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:46.087
You know what, I know a place,

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:48.789
auto parts, tires,
10 minutes from here,

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:50.424
I'll take you, we could
change the tire together,

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.060
that way you don't have to
sit around waiting for a tow.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.227
Come on.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.264
No, I'll just wait, I'm fine.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.852
Tim, if you wait
here for a tow,

01:19:00.853 --> 01:19:02.837
you're not gonna be on
the road until rush hour.

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.506
I tell you what,

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:08.008
I can give you some tips
about the final exam.

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:16.817
TIM: Okay.

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:18.153
Thanks.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.925
I'm just gonna
take a short cut

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.861
through the nature preserve.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:28.530
Cool.

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.044
I used to come
here on field trips,

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.946
when I was a little
bit younger than you,

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.916
I always liked it, but the other
kids thought it was boring.

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.985
Yeah, there's no
service out here.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:56.924
Preston's blind in one eye.

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:04.799
Probably hard to take pictures
without any depth perception,

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:06.867
he may even have a limp,

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:11.005
but his brain's okay, so
he can remember all of it.

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:17.912
Are we lost?

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:19.346
No,

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:24.852
it just goes around and
around in circles back here.

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:30.958
I remember when I was your age,

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.197
Colin Dalton and his friends.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.337
Why are you stopping?

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.210
What are you doing?

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.697
When I was 12,

01:20:52.698 --> 01:20:55.216
I found my father with one
of these stuck in his mouth,

01:20:55.218 --> 01:21:00.120
he's drunk and he beat me to a
pulp for walking in on him,

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:03.190
then he finished the job
a couple of years later

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.125
in a motel room somewhere.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:09.029
I'd say that my aim is pretty
foolproof from this range,

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.197
wouldn't you, Tim?

I don't wanna
hurt you, Tim, okay,

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.071
you just do what I say.

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:19.206
We're gonna be driving
home soon, I promise.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.108
Do you understand?

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.343
Okay.
Okay.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:25.145

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.670
the nearest police
station's 10 miles from here

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:51.305

which way to go, okay.

Confess what,
what do you want?

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:27.341
You got Bill and Scott
to destroy Preston's life.

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:32.713
You tormented Daniela, you're
the ringleader of all of it.

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:34.448
I didn't make them do shit.

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:40.054
You set an example,

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:43.123
you drove that poor girl
to try and kill herself.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.358

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:48.362

bottom of my feet,

so that no one can see.

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:29.063
He calls it training.

When I've done something wrong,

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:34.068
or he just had a bad day,

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:39.473
he uses his belt or sometimes
the grip of his putter.

out of the game,

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:53.187
he made me run on the treadmill

till I threw up all over myself

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:57.491
and then he made me clean it up.
