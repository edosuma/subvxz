05:14.417 --> 05:19.425
15 gingerbread houses? Some things never change.

05:19.702 --> 05:22.576

06:10.171 --> 06:15.241
Can I see my dream in the sky. - I think it's very nice.

06:16.841 --> 06:22.373
It's a miracle. Like an angel It would be down from heaven.

06:22.732 --> 06:27.025
Really! I lost a "miracle"? - You can not without cynicism?

06:27.146 --> 06:30.949
I can, but I did not bother. What I have lost?

06:31.049 --> 06:34.928
Remember how important trip to Florida for me and Daddy?

07:06.916 --> 07:09.228
All right, see you later.

07:09.784 --> 07:12.041
Good night baby. - Good night.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.762
Sorry I did not come for a long time, but now I'm here.

07:17.882 --> 07:22.426
We understand, baby. You saved the world the financial criminals.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.731
The way things are, I'm surprised you came now.

07:25.832 --> 07:31.334
Sorry to take so to sell the house. I know what's important to you.

07:47.873 --> 07:52.672
I wanted to surprise everyone, but you know how much we invested in this place.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.810
Then I should have sell it to anyone.

07:55.921 --> 08:01.533
Well ... it's sold. I think the guy will take good care of it.

08:01.669 --> 08:05.227
I have a good feeling about him. You do not? - It's nice.

08:05.368 --> 08:08.972
- Rely on feelings? - No, on his generous offer ...

08:09.073 --> 08:11.725
You have not rushed a little? Mom?

08:11.826 --> 08:14.901
Not at all. I tried Monday days to sell.

08:15.003 --> 08:17.556

08:23.712 --> 08:27.785
But now, no longer have to talk about it.

08:27.886 --> 08:32.696
I think I need to talk. - Do not have to!

08:32.811 --> 08:37.390
Except your mother's choice, I have never been safer.

08:38.599 --> 08:40.607
What a joke!

08:41.767 --> 08:46.792
Good night baby. - We love you. Welcome home.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.935
- How are you? - Everything's wrong.

09:16.249 --> 09:18.879
- What's wrong? - Tree.

09:19.777 --> 09:21.146
Not only it is artificial ...

09:21.597 --> 09:26.645
but color sequence, the mother has taught us, it's totally bogus.

09:27.357 --> 09:33.355
Yes. Normal e "Red - Green - small sweets"!

09:33.493 --> 09:36.615
Who are you, "Rainbow Man"? - It was always so.

09:36.742 --> 09:40.268
- At least all good holidays. - Oh yes.

09:40.444 --> 09:47.498
Actually, it's a direct correlation between Christmas tree kinds and arrangement.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.788
- Tea? - Nothing.

09:50.939 --> 09:53.825
- Come on... - Nothing.

09:57.349 --> 10:02.190
Well ... I was planning to buy the house.

10:02.925 --> 10:07.450
What?! Already sold it. They knew?

10:08.381 --> 10:12.454
- Not quite. - Wait. I did not know you're thinking of moving.

10:12.782 --> 10:16.031
Go home? That's awesome! - It sucks. - Why?

10:16.181 --> 10:19.430
They sold my house a stranger.

10:19.568 --> 10:25.406
In their defense: I assume that "not even" means they had no idea?

10:25.528 --> 10:27.857
Good. They did not know.

10:30.370 --> 10:37.380
Why do not you buy it yourself? - I am home. It's full of them in the city.

10:37.559 --> 10:42.594
Yes, but this is my house. - First, it was never yours.

10:42.724 --> 10:46.225
It was ours. I you're a little selfish.

10:46.335 --> 10:50.354
Selfish? I offer I buy my house!

10:50.889 --> 10:52.921
Good...

10:54.233 --> 10:58.605
I do not want to be hard on yourself. - But in a way, you are.

10:58.706 --> 11:04.405
Yes. I ... It's great to have you here. In particular Christmas.

11:04.606 --> 11:10.119
And I know ... I do not like to force things. I do not like!

11:10.445 --> 11:17.312
And I know you could not be here in recent years, because it was very hard.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.905
And understanding. But, you know. Some people...

11:22.197 --> 11:27.776
even want to be with their families, when it's hard. - I was at work.

11:29.650 --> 11:33.199
Safe! In court, Christmas.

11:36.723 --> 11:38.787
Hey...

11:40.318 --> 11:42.319
Look at me!

11:46.404 --> 11:52.915
Glad you're here. And I'm excited to move back.

11:53.204 --> 11:58.752
But you can not shut to all, and then expect to read your thoughts.

11:59.002 --> 12:06.059
You have to express your feelings, not too close to the cell phone mailbox.

12:11.310 --> 12:14.159
Have finished? - Not.

12:14.317 --> 12:19.606
And did not you say anything about moving Until a few seconds.

12:19.747 --> 12:23.556
Did you know that dreams Florida always...

12:24.065 --> 12:28.651
Selling the house was difficult. You should be happy for them.

12:28.752 --> 12:33.476
But I'm glad. - And there are other houses for sale.

12:33.576 --> 12:37.281
Why should you buy necessarily house?

12:39.764 --> 12:41.825
What is that?

12:43.278 --> 12:46.289
I do not remember it. Where did?

12:48.137 --> 12:53.006
Out of nowhere. - O, was "materialized" somewhere.

12:58.531 --> 13:00.548
It's from a guy.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.218
I'm the little sister, I know things like that. Confess!

13:07.095 --> 13:11.301
Remember the summer when I was here, Before my dad build the house?

You did it in the woods? - I was 9 years old. So talk with patients?

13:17.092 --> 13:21.629
I did not know. - Not. We played together.

13:21.925 --> 13:23.928
All that summer ... and ...

13:26.563 --> 13:30.372
Then he ... - He did what?

13:33.002 --> 13:40.523

14:32.425 --> 14:35.507
Want to fall in love again.

14:35.637 --> 14:42.692
Wow, that's a big step. - There's something wrong. - This is ridiculous. That's not why I came here.

22:23.685 --> 22:28.714
We did not come here after I I did 10 years. - She lived here?

22:28.823 --> 22:32.142
I do not believe. I guess it was family on vacation.

22:32.691 --> 22:35.771
Perhaps he had forgotten.

22:36.556 --> 22:40.765
But it was my first ... - A good friend.

22:42.132 --> 22:46.001
Yes. It was my first a good friend.

22:50.754 --> 22:55.106
Michael is a very nice guy. When you It was last on a date?

22:55.228 --> 22:59.836
It is none of your business. - I'm your mother, and so it's my job.

23:00.099 --> 23:04.601
It seems to me fine. It felt judged with "admiration".

23:04.934 --> 23:09.935
Maybe it's married. I do not know. I have not questioned about privacy.

23:10.036 --> 23:13.890
- Are you interested in this guy? - Who? - Not!

23:14.243 --> 23:18.915
The guy who bought the house. Your mom likes him. - Not true.

23:19.059 --> 23:21.459
I do not know him. And none of us know him.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.285
It would not hurt to try to know him.

23:23.663 --> 23:28.416
That would make sense only if it were free. Should we invite him for Christmas?

23:28.527 --> 23:30.556
I already asked.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.962
I want the house.

23:36.848 --> 23:42.906
How? - I want the house. It's clear We do not really know this guy.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.679
I want the house! - What...?

23:46.956 --> 23:51.781
I want a dog. I thought. I want a dog last night.

23:51.902 --> 23:56.445
Wait. Would our house? - Henry, can we talk later?

23:56.545 --> 24:00.617
Santa arrived early. - Not. Santa is not coming sooner. - Safe?

24:00.747 --> 24:05.021
Stati. Why do you want our house? - If you do not keep your fingers, not at all.

24:05.122 --> 24:09.971
You live in the city. Or do you want to resell? - Not.

24:10.106 --> 24:14.943
Henry and I go back home. - Now? When we move?

24:15.094 --> 24:18.648
That's not the reason. Mom, would you like to remain in the family home,

24:18.793 --> 24:21.807
and father have built the house with your own hands.

24:21.942 --> 24:26.454
I told the House a year ago. Why did not you say anything? - Do not have a price, then.

24:26.590 --> 24:31.148
I had a price from you! - OK. Settle down, everyone!

24:31.508 --> 24:36.715
Easy, Rod. It has now been solved. - No solve anything.

24:36.816 --> 24:41.868
Look, sweetheart. I signed a deal.

24:42.251 --> 24:44.702
The situation breaks my heart, but ...

24:44.835 --> 24:49.692
I do business, we signed The preliminary, and understanding is understanding.

24:49.833 --> 24:55.706
You should know these things. - Just, I know I have to be a loophole.

24:55.895 --> 24:59.707
Rod, sorry to interrupt. No offense, but ...

24:59.830 --> 25:05.635
Do not conditioning contract sale house of Michael?

25:05.810 --> 25:09.505
Yes, but it seems to indicate that ... - What? - Do not do this!

25:09.632 --> 25:13.727
So the contract is conditioned the actual sale of the property?

25:13.827 --> 25:18.667
It communicated that's just a formality. As it has several offers.

25:18.768 --> 25:22.282
Adult stuff ... - Why did not you say right away?

25:22.424 --> 25:25.964
Because of the way of understanding. - Wait ...

25:26.073 --> 25:30.612
For those who are "great disappointment" of the family, and no lawyers ...

25:30.722 --> 25:36.232
You are not "great disappointment" honey. - Thanks, Mom. That's cute.

25:36.420 --> 25:41.245
What are you talking about? - It is a set range, the need to sell the house,

25:41.369 --> 25:45.581
and if he does not, Dad can terminate the contract. That's right?

25:45.691 --> 25:49.891
Yes, but it's a nice guy. What ... What are you trying to do?

25:50.079 --> 25:55.315
I am your daughter, I'm nice! - Oh, listen to this. Now begins!

25:55.924 --> 25:58.431
So how many days has available?

25:59.227 --> 26:02.475
Until Christmas Eve. - Really?

26:02.613 --> 26:06.841
Take it slowly. Okay ... You take little crazy. - Do not take.

26:06.962 --> 26:11.337
Is true. Remember when you held submission that, in the "eleven"

26:11.460 --> 26:16.759
and you dressed in a suit starched white shirt business?

26:16.909 --> 26:20.431
Since then he began to wear clothes too pedantic?

26:20.532 --> 26:23.807
No, that was in the fifth. That was later, in high school.

26:23.957 --> 26:30.241
And your poor innocent partner, Missie Hamler, shed ...

26:30.405 --> 26:33.466
Cherry juice. And it was innocent.

26:33.604 --> 26:39.845
Did it shed on your blouse white and you erupt like a volcano.

26:39.953 --> 26:45.473
Seriously. As if i would have opened the skull, and flames coming out of your head them.

26:46.944 --> 26:52.151
And what's your idea? - I see Miss Hamler in your eyes.

27:39.286 --> 27:43.322
Well, hello. Even you We are looking for you.

27:44.046 --> 27:48.069
Well, you're very pretty. That's right?

27:49.297 --> 27:51.682
Take me to your master.

28:12.038 --> 28:15.704
Strolling around. - I noticed that do that often.

28:15.826 --> 28:21.382
I have a name? - Deliberate between Cody, Betsy or Blitzen.

28:21.844 --> 28:26.372
You did this? - Dad has done all, even "interiomul".

28:26.510 --> 28:30.766
Inside, baby. - Wow, what type capable.

28:30.921 --> 28:34.752
Yeah, I was a little ... - Withheld.

28:35.858 --> 28:38.352
- Yes. - Withheld?

28:38.382 --> 28:41.611
Yes. For 15 years I was an architect in the city.

28:41.950 --> 28:46.456
Mainly commercial stuff. It was a good job, but ...

28:46.566 --> 28:50.607
I do not know. I felt somehow away from it all. Do you understand?

28:51.741 --> 28:57.773
But you live in town? - Not yet. - But the plan to move here?

28:58.880 --> 29:02.125
What else? - It's funny that you ask that.

29:02.540 --> 29:06.203
In my parents' house ... - It's a fantastic place.

29:06.304 --> 29:10.363
Do you like our new home? - Yes. Finally we have a swing.

29:10.510 --> 29:15.043
We put back the rope swing. - That's not a good idea.

29:15.158 --> 29:19.019
Why? - Well, between us ...

29:19.157 --> 29:24.682
My parents had ... problems with bears.

29:27.905 --> 29:32.791
Bears? - Yes. Did not they tell you? It's weird.

29:32.903 --> 29:37.769
My father does not like guns, but He had to buy a large rifle.

29:38.151 --> 29:43.229
Rifle? - Yes. Do you get one? - No, I do not have.

29:45.352 --> 29:50.945
Think buy your one. Shotgun is needed to kill the bears.

29:52.335 --> 29:57.404
Incredible. - Yes. It's the big problem with bears.

29:57.619 --> 30:03.170
I know you signed the contract, but this information can change something?

30:03.295 --> 30:08.693
The place could not be more perfect, but now I have to build a fence.

30:08.843 --> 30:13.355
You have to build a fence? Yes, to keep the bears at bay.

30:13.804 --> 30:19.820
I am and general contractor. Do not the works of these blocks in the city.

30:19.940 --> 30:23.001
But it's okay anyway intend to renovate the living room.

30:23.139 --> 30:26.967
What's wrong with her? - Nothing. I was thinking to increase.

30:27.088 --> 30:30.093
Was it bigger? - No extensions?

30:30.237 --> 30:36.485
My house is very good as it is. - I know you're tied to it, but it's my house.

30:36.852 --> 30:39.885
Those bears were they scared? - What?

30:39.997 --> 30:43.883
There is of course a reason You do not want the house. - Yes, I want the house.

30:43.995 --> 30:49.473
Now I understand. - There were misunderstandings between me and my father.

30:49.582 --> 30:53.880
But they are linked soulful house. - And I.

30:53.992 --> 30:59.898
How can you be tied to my house? - Not home, but this place.

31:00.036 --> 31:02.114
See, when I was a kid ...

31:06.440 --> 31:11.326
Look, it was a mistake. We want to cancel the contract.

31:11.487 --> 31:19.061
I bought the house. The house is mine. - Not. It is mine. I have a contract.

31:19.323 --> 31:23.321
Look, if you search a house, mine is still for sale.

31:25.629 --> 31:31.217
Oh, you like that, huh? I'm not idiot. There are federal prosecutor.

31:31.370 --> 31:34.913
And I know that there is a stipulation in your contract.

31:35.019 --> 31:40.047
I began to think that they're not problems with bears. - Are you smart.

31:41.264 --> 31:45.787
I have three offers for my home. I gave her the sense.

31:45.978 --> 31:51.348
What did you do that for? - For even slightly ago, I thought you were a nice girl.

31:51.564 --> 31:53.648
Even?

31:54.975 --> 31:56.995
I think so.

31:58.307 --> 32:05.325
My real estate agency is around the corner. Surely you will find a nice place.

32:08.766 --> 32:10.820
I'm not finished.

32:14.756 --> 32:16.812
Goodbye, see you soon.

32:17.969 --> 32:22.967
I think he likes you, Dad. - I think not, baby.

32:28.985 --> 32:32.489
Jessica Wright? - Jet Marley?

32:33.174 --> 32:37.986
I have not seen for years. How are you? - I ...

32:38.659 --> 32:41.506
Good question. But what do you do?

32:41.650 --> 32:46.705
Very good. Your father says that live in the city. - And here I am.

32:47.306 --> 32:52.542
Federal prosecutor says you're. - I'm actually thinking about a change.

32:52.642 --> 32:56.510
Do not tell me. Veterinarian. - How do you remember that?

32:58.145 --> 33:02.360
How could I forget? In high school long wanted to become a veterinarian.

33:02.390 --> 33:08.454
You had those cats. - Yes. There I wanted to sign ...

33:08.569 --> 33:15.090
but ... high school? It was very old. - It seems to me like it was yesterday.

33:16.629 --> 33:20.160
Sometimes I think of prom graduation. - Oh God.

33:20.289 --> 33:24.823
It's been a wonderful night. I've never satisfied.

33:25.116 --> 33:30.149
For what? - Because you came with me. - Please. - You were Jessica Wright.

33:30.285 --> 33:32.285
And still are.

33:33.285 --> 33:38.288
And you're the same sweet Jet. - You were very kind to me.

33:38.389 --> 33:44.273
I ... I told the wife ... - Congratulations. - Thanks.

33:44.468 --> 33:46.700
I was a nerd. - You were not.

33:46.831 --> 33:50.879
Of course I was. But you've treated never so. You...

33:50.980 --> 33:55.052
You have to know my wife While you're in town. - I would like.

33:55.735 --> 33:57.778
You, you get married?

33:59.277 --> 34:01.277
Yes, I married.

34:03.739 --> 34:06.818
I opened an agency the estate.

34:07.540 --> 34:13.262
It's all right, is not it? I sold your father's house. Sure told ...

34:13.373 --> 34:16.074
It was you? - Yes.

34:16.176 --> 34:22.234
Well, Jet. Is it still you sell Bill and Michael's home? - That's right.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.938
I'll buy you a coffee. - I would like.

34:42.705 --> 34:47.764
Do not tell me. Your dog ran away again? - No, I came specially.

34:47.926 --> 34:50.925
I can help you with this? - Not.

34:51.126 --> 34:54.145
Are you sure? - Absolute.

34:54.455 --> 34:58.261
Definitive? - Definitive. What are you doing here?

34:58.411 --> 35:02.660
Masor court. - For what? - To fence.

35:02.810 --> 35:08.835
Look, there are bears. - I know, you already told me. Begin to repeat.

35:09.158 --> 35:14.705
You were very sweet day before. - Do not try to be sweet. - But you were.

35:16.044 --> 35:20.935
I'm done talking to you. Why measure, though?

35:21.074 --> 35:24.122
It would be nice fence. - To close the yard?

35:24.253 --> 35:26.850
Not if you put a pool. - A pool?

35:27.003 --> 35:29.284
Summer is very hot here.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.980
No swimming is not a good idea?

35:34.801 --> 35:40.082
Frankly, all your ideas about this house are bad ideas.

35:40.299 --> 35:44.798
Get inside. -Jessica! Can I call you that?

35:45.023 --> 35:50.861
Sure you can. It's my name. - Wonderful. Well, Jessica ...

35:51.831 --> 35:56.385
Look, I know the problem house it's a touchy subject, and ...

35:57.248 --> 35:59.340
I just wanted ...

36:01.793 --> 36:05.304
I do not know, to be friends.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.139
Sure you do not need help?

36:31.076 --> 36:34.651
Hey, I just saw on Michael yard.

36:34.784 --> 36:38.832
To be about what what I think? - Of course.

36:39.132 --> 36:41.132
Really?

36:42.281 --> 36:48.130
What say you? - I am just glad you initiative.

36:48.829 --> 36:52.828
Wait, that we are on the same side? - Absolute.

36:56.078 --> 36:59.189
I met with Jet Marley. You know it's the real estate agent?

36:59.219 --> 37:04.115
I knew. He sold this house. I think that has a lot to offer.

37:04.226 --> 37:07.068
It has everything I need.

37:07.887 --> 37:13.428
He's married. - Yes. And? - So...

37:15.884 --> 37:21.770
Good. Do not get me wrong. I think you should have fun, ...

37:21.882 --> 37:25.419
But I think that's an idea very bad.

37:25.842 --> 37:29.716
What are you talking about? I think I speak about different things.

37:29.818 --> 37:33.917
A flirt with Jet. - A flirt with Jet?

37:34.067 --> 37:38.130
Are you crazy? Talk about home, too? - Again the house?

37:38.265 --> 37:42.514
I can not believe you thought I an affair with a married man.

37:46.363 --> 37:51.928
I think I know Michael. If you are a spark.

37:52.030 --> 37:55.836
Oh, sparks are. But not the best.

37:57.872 --> 38:03.386
Maybe you have to go into the woods, as first boyfriend.

38:05.020 --> 38:11.555
Maybe you should shut up. - I'm just saying. Even Dad keeps talking about it.

38:11.756 --> 38:18.326
What? - I think my dad likes him. They became very close.

38:18.585 --> 38:23.615
And he still comes around. Maybe interested.

38:23.864 --> 38:27.101
Well, sure it is interested something.

38:27.751 --> 38:32.558
He wants to put a pool in the garden. Yes.

38:33.699 --> 38:40.547
What terrible man, and nothing despicable. Come on!

38:40.670 --> 38:46.054
I always wanted my pool. - I can not believe you're on his side.

38:46.159 --> 38:50.195
I want nothing to him. I only wish his house.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.336
This is a big step.

38:52.663 --> 38:57.681
Which? - As admit his house.

38:58.605 --> 39:04.191
I do not want to talk about it. - Jessica, you do not want to talk about anything.

39:04.353 --> 39:06.592
I think we should.

39:06.859 --> 39:13.211
Any Bring forward, you do not want let's talk. - Maybe because I do not want!

39:13.338 --> 39:19.527
Look, I'm fine. But if it comes meetings, I did not feel like it.

39:19.628 --> 39:25.152
Not so, Opra? - Yes. Even? You said "Opra"?

39:26.649 --> 39:30.276
Not yet ready meetings.

39:30.384 --> 39:35.735
Good. But if you are ... You are not registered. But if you are ...

39:36.183 --> 39:38.426
How would you like to be?

39:38.688 --> 39:44.080
Good. If I had, but be clearly I am not. Meaning?

39:45.342 --> 39:50.374
Then I want to be warm, cute and funny ...

39:51.228 --> 39:54.782
Cute kids ... And concessions.

39:57.575 --> 39:59.575
Valid?

40:00.504 --> 40:06.320
Yes. Well, if you ask me or my father, it's like you have described Michael.

40:07.766 --> 40:13.386
My father asked him not as he did not asked me to sell the house.

40:13.488 --> 40:18.541
Jessica, how may ask, when thou hast isolate us?

40:18.642 --> 40:22.035
For years you were away, and now you're back and ...

40:22.136 --> 40:24.675
whole story house, you ...

40:26.786 --> 40:31.615
I think you should follow some mandatory steps.

40:31.717 --> 40:34.800
If you want to stop being ever happy.

40:38.791 --> 40:41.601
I totally agree with you.

40:43.325 --> 40:47.879
Where you go? - To follow some mandatory steps.

40:58.479 --> 41:04.570
Mr. and Mrs. Robington. - Jill and Kevin. Please, Mr. Marley. - Jet, please.

41:04.708 --> 41:08.064
So this is ... - Jet! Jet!

41:08.206 --> 41:14.255
Jessica. Hey. - We always meet. - Yes...

41:14.870 --> 41:17.734
They are Kevin and Jill. - Hey.

41:18.053 --> 41:24.274
I wanted to show them the house of Bill. - Michael? Good luck.

41:24.571 --> 41:26.605
Cam demolished, huh?

41:28.312 --> 41:31.811
I enjoyed, as always, Jess.

41:31.949 --> 41:35.521
We should enter. - You think it's a good idea?

41:35.648 --> 41:40.691
Why not show them Kirkwood house? To me, it's more beautiful.

41:40.797 --> 41:45.309
Here lighting is perfect. - Really? Why do you say that?

41:46.012 --> 41:49.051
Have you seen the cellar here? - Not.

41:49.307 --> 41:55.702
Sounds like garbage landfill. - I said, he used as a studio.

41:55.803 --> 42:01.870
I only say what I think: Kirkwood house It is more suited to a pair so young.

42:02.532 --> 42:05.069
I could decide I this?

42:06.540 --> 42:10.435
Kirkwood House is available? - Oh, I do not ...

42:15.972 --> 42:18.040
Yes it is.

42:19.701 --> 42:25.575
It's a beautiful place? - No, it's ... - Wonderful.

42:25.853 --> 42:28.892
She is pretty... Like this.

42:29.433 --> 42:34.175
Good! - Yes, you will like. - Is that so. - It's great.

42:34.293 --> 42:42.129
Well ... Is it far from here? - At the end of the street. You can go now.

42:44.078 --> 42:46.955
Good. Honey, I found a home.

43:00.286 --> 43:03.523
Mom will not go mad, it is not like that?

43:04.285 --> 43:09.172
Not. Why do you say that? - Well you said this morning.

43:09.753 --> 43:13.183
Oh, I ... Just kidding.

43:14.320 --> 43:21.344
I'm a little worried mother. - Why? Why are you worried?

43:21.545 --> 43:27.616
You cry? - Safe. All complain sometimes.

43:28.667 --> 43:31.209
Well, do not cry mother.

43:31.816 --> 43:37.799
How? - She did not cry. I mean, I do not want to cry, but ...

43:37.914 --> 43:45.162
so do not cry, do not believe yet not sorry after his father.

43:45.579 --> 43:52.160
He sometimes would like to cry, but she thinks she can not.

43:54.409 --> 44:01.616
Honey, your mother is a person mightiest know.

44:01.757 --> 44:08.822
It's really fixed on this house. - It was always self-possessed.

44:09.404 --> 44:14.291
But sometimes when people is fixed on something,

44:14.404 --> 44:18.494
it's perhaps because they do not want to think of something else.

44:20.844 --> 44:24.413
... I just want to help.

44:25.050 --> 44:27.050
Oh, come here.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.073
Tell me what you want for Christmas?

44:35.397 --> 44:38.967
I want to see my mother smiling again.

46:56.457 --> 46:59.706
Hey, that's the tree? - Henry?

47:01.684 --> 47:06.724
You're right, Mom? - No ... I mean yes.

47:09.434 --> 47:13.991
Not quite. - You found it. You play.

47:15.101 --> 47:17.101
Hey.

47:17.756 --> 47:21.800
Wait. It is impossible. - What?

47:21.950 --> 47:26.448
This dog looks enormous as in summer, but ...

47:28.949 --> 47:31.192
Not. - No, it's the same dog.

47:31.293 --> 47:36.840
Henry, how to be? It was many years ago. - See?

47:42.692 --> 47:47.543
Time to go. - But, Mom, How to find the tree?

47:47.643 --> 47:52.203
You believe in it that much. We know he likes to walk.

47:52.341 --> 47:56.183
Time Capsule. Where is?

47:57.340 --> 48:01.339
I think it sit. - Want to dig?

48:01.589 --> 48:04.404
I do not think it's a good idea.

48:06.087 --> 48:08.337
She wants to dig.

48:08.842 --> 48:13.885
Well, it's welcome to unearth. Have fun.

48:14.036 --> 48:19.284
But I think it's better to stays buried. Time to go.

48:19.434 --> 48:21.712
But mom ... - Come on.

48:24.194 --> 48:26.194
Come on.

48:31.730 --> 48:36.293
I know it's the same dog. - How can you know that?

48:36.429 --> 48:40.685
I have a feeling, do not you? - Honey, it's impossible.

48:40.828 --> 48:43.859
Jump up. - I think not.

48:45.326 --> 48:47.875
And you know what I think? - What?

48:48.917 --> 48:54.744
I think your friend is somewhere around here. - I know. Somewhere in this world.

48:54.873 --> 48:59.222
No, mother. I think you'll see soon again.

48:59.459 --> 49:07.014
Honey, what's wrong with you? - I just... I do not want to be alone.

49:07.653 --> 49:10.055
Oh, dear, not the only one.

49:10.834 --> 49:16.418
I got you. Do you understand? And mom and dad and Anna and Mitch.

49:16.861 --> 49:20.125
Do you understand? - Yes. But it's different.

49:20.226 --> 49:24.792
Darling, do not be worried about me. I'm great. - Safe?

49:25.015 --> 49:27.015
Absolutely safe.

49:27.414 --> 49:34.412
You know, I have a plan. We bought this house we move here and everything will be fine.

49:35.412 --> 49:37.482
Agree? - Agree.

49:39.761 --> 49:43.997
And you ... to bed. Good? - Mom.

49:45.728 --> 49:48.258
You know you see him again?

49:51.301 --> 49:56.169
Close your eyes and dream at this. Good?

49:57.806 --> 50:01.832
Good. Good night, Mom. - Good night, honey.

50:04.504 --> 50:11.087
And here I presented the story of two naive children a home block

50:11.252 --> 50:14.757
who sacrificed for each other supreme treasure of the house.

50:14.787 --> 50:19.496
And my last word of wisdom is that of all who give,

50:19.649 --> 50:22.017
these two were the wisest.

50:23.149 --> 50:29.476
Everywhere are wisest. They are the magi.

50:29.601 --> 50:34.144
Beautiful, right? - Yes. I think. I'm a little confused.

50:34.245 --> 50:39.053
I know. That's the Christmas spirit. Sacrifice for the beloved.

50:39.183 --> 50:41.692
I love Christmas. - And I.

50:41.833 --> 50:47.389
There's nothing wrong with a little love, joy and forgiveness. - And gifts?

50:47.741 --> 50:50.554
And gifts.

50:52.153 --> 50:56.282
Dad, are you single?

50:57.327 --> 51:03.843
Single? I? I got you, huh?

51:03.944 --> 51:09.771
Yes, but Bryan's mother. And seemed much happier.

51:11.292 --> 51:15.808
Agree. - I mean ... - I know what you mean, honey.

51:16.033 --> 51:18.583
And do not worry about me, I can handle.

51:19.587 --> 51:22.827
I'd like to meet someone as Della. From the story.

51:22.932 --> 51:26.220
You know, Della would have a bad name for a dog.

51:26.381 --> 51:31.651
No, it does not resemble Della. And I do not speak dog, Dad.

51:31.752 --> 51:33.966
I'm talking about that woman.

51:36.663 --> 51:38.931
Oh, well.

51:40.295 --> 51:42.317
Sweet Dreams.

51:43.907 --> 51:47.418
You need someone to take care of yourself.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.498
You deserve it.

51:51.886 --> 51:54.904
Thank you, Maddie. - You dreamed it.

51:56.807 --> 51:58.828
Good.

52:04.667 --> 52:11.876
Once, my world was smaller Room in my hand ...

52:12.703 --> 52:20.655
my cup was full of diamonds What I have lost as sand

52:21.348 --> 52:29.100
And even though I'm empty cup Memories remain

52:29.577 --> 52:33.568
... in my heart.

52:34.374 --> 52:41.877
Ever hear our laughter I share secrets

52:42.457 --> 52:49.828
Echo wind that blows I hear that a prayer

52:50.829 --> 52:58.801
For friendship lives forever A treasure that remained ...

52:58.831 --> 53:02.485
my heart ...

53:04.527 --> 53:12.185
Where's the baby What used to hide

53:12.854 --> 53:18.825
Here in, in my heart ...

53:34.944 --> 53:39.987
What are you two? -Jessie, They still you know Michael? - How could I forget him?

53:41.942 --> 53:45.815
This is Jet. - I do not think he is.

53:46.991 --> 53:52.497
I'm sure it's Jet. - It's upset. Do you know why?

53:53.436 --> 53:57.323
I have no idea. I have to go.

54:00.274 --> 54:03.136
What did you do yesterday? - I have...

54:03.286 --> 54:07.835
I try to do my job. I have not seen for many years ...

54:07.935 --> 54:11.215
I know people change, What happened to you?

54:11.334 --> 54:15.834
You say you want to see Michael's home and you want to move back,

54:15.935 --> 54:19.188
and then say you do not like. It's not for you.

54:19.289 --> 54:21.896
And when you find a pair which is suitable ...

54:21.997 --> 54:25.312
I just thought the house Kirkwood it's right for them.

54:25.430 --> 54:29.428
I mean, I am interested in career real estate? Not looking for a house?

54:29.528 --> 54:34.030
If you want to work my agency, There is a better way.

54:34.131 --> 54:37.171
It was a disaster. - Wait.

54:37.327 --> 54:41.876
If I know you well, I would say that sabotage me.

54:41.976 --> 54:46.011
Sabotage you? No no. Do not try this.

54:46.124 --> 54:49.182
You know I try to help Michael to sell the house, otherwise ...

54:49.283 --> 54:53.803
Otherwise I will not be able to Buy her father's house.

54:54.221 --> 54:56.221
Hey.

54:58.299 --> 55:03.819
What was that? I'm not like you. - I wanted to see another house.

55:03.969 --> 55:08.817
Not. You liar substituted. No house is worth your honor.

55:08.917 --> 55:13.346
Now back to hell? I do not know why I came back here.

55:13.466 --> 55:17.515
Let's go over ... - Wonderful. It is like in the past 3 years.

55:21.076 --> 55:25.901
It seems that this house want more Now, when my mother and me leave.

55:28.627 --> 55:34.452

I miss you.

55:52.904 --> 55:54.904
I find their place here.

55:56.066 --> 55:59.065
Why do not you want to be your family?

56:01.638 --> 56:05.887
I do not find my place here, Christmas without Carter.

56:08.300 --> 56:10.815
It seems there's a reason.

56:21.059 --> 56:23.103
I was in awe.

56:26.058 --> 56:28.111
After the death of Carter ...

56:29.742 --> 56:35.260
I did the only thing it I knew. And that you've said.

56:35.443 --> 56:37.476
Keep yourself occupied?

56:39.392 --> 56:42.712
Yes. I was always working.

56:47.052 --> 56:50.051
Dad, I wanted to see ...

56:51.188 --> 56:53.222

56:54.187 --> 56:59.700

57:17.935 --> 57:21.271
Sorry, Dad. - Give me too.

57:23.760 --> 57:27.630
I wanted to say earlier, I think ...

57:28.040 --> 57:32.427
But now we have to separate From home. It's too late.

57:33.465 --> 57:38.777
How much we cared for it Mom and I remain just a house ...

57:40.036 --> 57:42.574
You can build your a home anywhere.

57:46.073 --> 57:50.377
And using a box ujina as the capsule of time. - What?

57:50.513 --> 57:56.361
Time Capsule. It was like a collection of memories all summer.

57:56.470 --> 57:59.747
You know, small memories.

58:00.347 --> 58:04.245
What kind of memories? - I do not know ... Let's see ...

58:05.360 --> 58:09.615
A stone ... a leaf ...

58:13.336 --> 58:18.837
A game piece. - Why have you kept stuff? They were valuable?

58:20.925 --> 58:23.262
For me were priceless.

59:58.835 --> 01:00:01.654

Who's the lucky guy? - Nobody is lucky ... he's too excited.

01:01:01.418 --> 01:01:04.480
Then why are you smiling? - Do not smile.

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:08.848
It's a nervous smile, but the corners of the mouth are up.

01:01:08.977 --> 01:01:10.977
Almost did not recognize you.

01:01:15.214 --> 01:01:18.905

01:07:07.714 --> 01:07:10.975
Daddy, why did you call "old waste"?

01:07:11.113 --> 01:07:16.185
Time Capsule is very important. I thought you were mad at her.

01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:21.759
I was not angry capsule rather her. - The best friend?

01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:27.999
Not. Jessica. - I'm trying to apologize.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:35.811
All I want for Christmas Are you ...

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:42.959
Nothing "old" or "new" Nothing "borrowed" or "blue"

01:07:43.389 --> 01:07:48.472
I'm afraid nothing I have

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:53.238
For all I want for Christmas Are you ...

01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:08.671
If I could follow you Wherever you go

01:08:09.174 --> 01:08:13.412
One day I'll surprise Under the mistletoe

01:08:14.711 --> 01:08:19.265

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:24.895
How could you resist me In this cold season ...

01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:28.631
When all I want for Christmas Are you ...

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:44.386
What hot year, huh?

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:49.385
It would be nice snow. Do you remember how much it was in the first year?

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:55.395
Onions help me with this? - Safe. - I can not find the other end.

01:08:58.745 --> 01:09:02.545
Thank you. - Is everything okay?

01:09:04.031 --> 01:09:07.085
There are terrible. - Jess?

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:12.944
I am a horrible human being. A destroyer of dreams.

01:09:13.305 --> 01:09:17.502
And a saboteur. - That's life a federal prosecutor.

01:09:17.602 --> 01:09:22.586
No, mother. I was completely withdrawn in myself. And still are.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:29.929
A little secret, Jess. Life go only one way.

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:33.935
Before. It is time to forget the past.

01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:41.180
Every moment You make a choice.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.594
In what sense? - To believe.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:48.707
Tomorrow will be better.

01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:54.095
That's hard. - If it were easy, everyone would do it.

01:09:54.216 --> 01:09:57.431
The difficulties are distinguished the strongest.

01:09:59.899 --> 01:10:05.954
Look, yesterday went, "tomorrow" it is not yet here, you just this.

01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:09.062
It depends on you, how you want to end.

01:10:09.212 --> 01:10:16.260
What you think and feel, even now, will determine tomorrow.

01:10:19.659 --> 01:10:22.509
It's about Michael, huh?

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:28.062
How did you know? - I knew you like.

01:10:28.219 --> 01:10:31.595
I did not know that I like. - Who?

01:10:32.655 --> 01:10:35.865
He's "Han". - What?

01:10:36.262 --> 01:10:40.518
What this means? - What... Michael? That's awesome!

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:45.494
That's incredible! He had a little romance secret with him when they were children, and ...

01:10:45.595 --> 01:10:50.411
He met a boy, spent all summer in the woods ... And it was Michael?

01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:55.250
It's so romantic, Jess! - That's incredible. - It's terrible.

01:10:55.392 --> 01:10:59.428
Folks, he hates me. - Because He saw only what's worse to you.

01:10:59.548 --> 01:11:04.200
Just yet. - Your sister is right. It's so cute.

01:11:04.307 --> 01:11:10.130
Yes. Pretty, and is kind to children but I do not want to talk.

01:11:10.245 --> 01:11:12.338
But you can change that.

01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:17.743
Jess does not have guarantees you will not suffer. That's life.

01:11:18.493 --> 01:11:21.239
But what if ...

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:25.600
What would it not be anything? - But if there's anything?

01:13:03.014 --> 01:13:10.067
Yeah, no, that's ... Wow. Thanks, Jet. These are fantastic news.

01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:18.009
Not sure that I get. But, Again, thank you. And Merry Christmas!

01:13:18.359 --> 01:13:23.196
Well, hello. I sold the house. - That's awesome!

01:13:24.342 --> 01:13:27.539
We have much work ... - We can now go to the Christmas party?

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:30.150
Take it soft!

01:13:30.355 --> 01:13:33.604
You sold the house, Why are you angry?

01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:37.303
It's complicated.

01:13:44.201 --> 01:13:48.553
Are you trying to tell me something? - I think you should give him a chance.

01:13:48.701 --> 01:13:51.254
It strives father. - Dog?

01:13:51.865 --> 01:13:56.390

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.140
Not bad. - Thanks.

01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:33.487
I wonder if she will remember. - Do not worry, sure will remember.

01:14:33.638 --> 01:14:38.180
Only he dug up the capsule time. - Not what I meant.

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:42.500
When he gave me this, He whispered something.

01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:47.005
I know, you told me you forgot. - I lied.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:54.370
Liar. Liar true. Confess! - Good.

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:22.343

I agree with you.

01:16:07.687 --> 01:16:09.753
"Force be with you"!

01:16:14.459 --> 01:16:17.309

So how was it? - It's so sweet. Henry I built a plane.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:03.905
Oh, how cute. - I know. - See? Have you been worried for nothing.

01:17:04.045 --> 01:17:07.734
Did you look? - What? - The medallion.

01:17:08.044 --> 01:17:12.112

01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:30.232
It's fine? - I do not know. It was acting strange all night.

01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:45.541
Not crazy all the time. Jessica. Do not always nonsense.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:50.190
I mean, to be clear, it's crazy. It's a woman. But it's not always the case ...

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:54.108
To lie, to deceive, to try to take my house. - Yes, things like that.

01:17:54.281 --> 01:17:59.967
As a woman. In fact, she's a frightened little girl. - Scared of what?

01:18:00.079 --> 01:18:03.095
Suffering again. - And then I got hit on me?

01:18:03.228 --> 01:18:08.027
Yes, it's basic stuff. When you were little, You fucked a girl hair? - Not.

01:18:08.171 --> 01:18:12.425
You have not thrown in the mud? - Not. - Do not you beat? - Not.

01:18:12.525 --> 01:18:17.024
You have not got ... - You had a childhood violence, Mitch?

01:18:17.174 --> 01:18:22.974
I'm just say ... As a child, You have not done anything girls?

01:18:24.422 --> 01:18:28.998
I got scared and ran. - But how you hooked one?

01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:34.891
Usually the girl follow me into the woods and found me. - I do not know what this means...

It's Christmas Eve. - Sure it is.

01:18:42.567 --> 01:18:45.416
Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

01:18:46.544 --> 01:18:51.437
What were talking about you two? - I have no idea.

01:18:51.565 --> 01:18:56.808
It's very common with Mitch. - About your attempt to take my house, it would be ...

01:18:56.913 --> 01:19:02.001
as pushing a girl in mud. At least I think so.

01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:06.100
Look, everything went. OK?

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:11.098

01:19:16.096 --> 01:19:22.132
It's Christmas, right? And Jet me He said he sold the house. - Congratulations!

01:19:22.256 --> 01:19:28.275
Did he say who bought it? - Not yet we met, but I think her name Leia.

01:19:29.666 --> 01:19:32.665
Like "Princess Leia"? - So she said.

01:19:32.818 --> 01:19:36.617
Weird, huh? - Why is that weird?

01:19:37.061 --> 01:19:41.900
I do not know. Only... - What?

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:53.447
There is nothing. - Nothing? Oh, you Princess Leia in love, right?

01:19:53.897 --> 01:19:57.127
Yes. You like that slave role.

01:19:57.795 --> 01:20:02.294
Yeah, right, but no, no ... Not what I meant.

01:20:03.838 --> 01:20:07.392
When I was a kid, very young...

01:20:09.079 --> 01:20:13.891
Remember that camp He was here? - Yes.

01:20:15.491 --> 01:20:19.512
And you meet a girl. In the camp.

01:20:20.039 --> 01:20:22.039
It's cute.

01:20:26.995 --> 01:20:32.073
It's stupid. - I do not seem something silly. - Really, it's nothing ...

01:20:32.647 --> 01:20:34.647
Nothing?

01:20:35.985 --> 01:20:40.828
I was 9 years It was madness ...

01:20:41.533 --> 01:20:47.781
I had a breakfast box ... You I saw her at the store. - That "waste"?

01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:54.967
Yes, I called it so. I buried and then ... - Did you say something?

01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:59.679
You made promises?

01:21:02.528 --> 01:21:05.577
I do not know. Probable.

01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.382
It's been a long time. It's hard to remember.

01:21:13.074 --> 01:21:18.573
I guess it was not so important. - You know how it is when you're young ...

01:21:19.047 --> 01:21:22.296
You can imagine as always You will think the same.

01:21:24.632 --> 01:21:26.632
But do not do that.

01:21:27.388 --> 01:21:30.890
You know how kids are. They like talking.

01:21:32.069 --> 01:21:34.318
Yes, things that do not.

01:21:42.828 --> 01:21:46.365
Something to drink? - Yes.

01:21:51.864 --> 01:21:55.911
Maybe we should take it out outside. - Yes.

01:21:58.624 --> 01:22:04.185
Hey. So? - Where was I thinking? We are no longer children.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:10.908
What are you saying? I've shown the locket? - Believe me, it would not be interested.

01:22:11.147 --> 01:22:16.680
It was stupid. - Mama dog He came out. Looks sick.

01:22:18.617 --> 01:22:23.616
Do not worry, honey. We'll find. - Stay here. We will come back.

01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:33.501

Oh yes. You'll be fine.

01:24:10.416 --> 01:24:15.253
You're very good with dogs. - It's a special dog.
