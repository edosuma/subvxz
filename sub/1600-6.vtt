00:02.988 --> 00:04.522
Look, I know that
you have spent your life

00:04.623 --> 00:06.323
taking care of other people.

00:06.391 --> 00:08.759
Now I am gonna take care of you,
Norma Bates.

00:08.827 --> 00:10.693
Look, I really like your mom.

00:10.762 --> 00:16.400
She's a good woman,
and I care for her.

00:16.501 --> 00:18.269
- This is all Dylan's fault.
- Don't blame him, mom.

00:18.370 --> 00:19.870
He's just worried about me!

00:19.938 --> 00:21.405
No, he's just trying
to turn you against me!

00:21.473 --> 00:22.394
No one could do that!

00:22.403 --> 00:24.083
These girls were brought here
from China.

00:24.201 --> 00:28.112
Then guys came to the motel
to try them out.

00:28.213 --> 00:29.914
So, you know the girl from
the manga book, right?

00:30.015 --> 00:32.049
- Of course.
- Help me.

00:32.116 --> 00:35.052
I found her.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.120
She was being held prisoner
in Shelby's basement.

00:37.189 --> 00:38.956
I think he was running
some kind of Asian sex slave

00:39.057 --> 00:40.791
business with Keith Summers.

00:40.859 --> 00:44.261
Sometimes you hear and see
things that aren't there.

00:44.329 --> 00:47.965
- That's not true.
- It's true.

00:48.066 --> 00:50.100
This is the girl.
The girl I told you about.

00:50.202 --> 00:52.636
The girl from the basement.
Tell her!

00:52.704 --> 00:56.640
Tell her you were locked
in that cop's basement.

00:56.708 --> 01:00.544
This is not the man, right?

01:00.612 --> 01:02.613
He is the man.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.793
Mom?

01:18.063 --> 01:21.632
Mom, are you okay?

01:21.700 --> 01:23.701
Mother.

01:32.444 --> 01:34.111
Should we get her some water?

01:34.179 --> 01:35.513
I think we should
get her some water.

01:35.614 --> 01:37.147
I've never seen her like this.

01:37.249 --> 01:39.617
Maybe she just needs
to calm down a little.

01:39.718 --> 01:41.318
She's pretty calm.

01:41.419 --> 01:44.822
Yeah, I think we should
get her some water.

01:44.923 --> 01:47.124
Well, maybe she just needs
to absorb the information

01:47.192 --> 01:48.792
for a minute.

01:48.894 --> 01:51.161
I can't imagine what a shock.

01:51.263 --> 01:52.584
I mean, a guy
you were really into

01:52.631 --> 01:54.732
turning out to be
a monster like that.

01:56.368 --> 01:57.601
Yeah, it's horrible.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.537
She's been through
so much already.

02:01.206 --> 02:03.040
Wait, where'd she go?

02:03.108 --> 02:05.476
Oh, hell.

02:14.185 --> 02:16.887
Mom!

02:16.988 --> 02:19.056
Mom, stop it!

02:19.124 --> 02:21.191
Hands off the wheel, Norman!

02:23.662 --> 02:25.996
Mom! Mom!

02:26.097 --> 02:27.231
Stop!

02:27.299 --> 02:30.568
Stop the car!

02:32.571 --> 02:34.505
Don't do this, mom!
This isn't the way to handle it!

02:34.573 --> 02:36.974
- Son of a bitch!
- Stop the car!

02:37.042 --> 02:40.210
- Damn lying dirtbag!
- Take your foot off the gas!

02:40.312 --> 02:42.746
- You're gonna kill us!
- Well, I don't care!

02:44.049 --> 02:46.083
- Stop the car!
- Shit.

02:46.151 --> 02:48.652
Stop it! Let me go!
Stop!

02:48.753 --> 02:51.255
Don't do this, mom!
This isn't the way to handle it!

02:54.659 --> 02:58.329
Oh! Stop!
I've gotta talk to him!

03:04.769 --> 03:06.704
I have to talk to him.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.972
You're not gonna just talk
to him, mom, let's be honest.

03:08.974 --> 03:10.174
I don't know what I'm gonna do,

03:10.208 --> 03:11.875
but he can't get away with it!

03:11.977 --> 03:13.110
- He's not going to!
- 'Cause everybody always

03:13.211 --> 03:14.612
gets away with everything!

03:14.713 --> 03:16.981
- He's not going to!
- It's not fair!

03:21.353 --> 03:23.988
I promise you, mother.
We will get him.

03:27.359 --> 03:28.759
He's a bad guy,
and we will get him.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.794
We just have to do it
the right way.

03:37.636 --> 03:38.969
Okay.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.805
Yeah, we will.
You're right.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.576
Okay.

03:45.644 --> 03:48.812
Now go find the damn keys.

04:00.558 --> 04:02.292
What is it, Dylan?

04:02.360 --> 04:05.362
Something happened.
I need to talk to you.

04:06.998 --> 04:08.732
Ethan was bleeding like hell.

04:08.833 --> 04:13.771
It--it was a--
it was a real mess.

04:13.838 --> 04:17.741
So, I dragged him into
the passenger seat and--

04:17.841 --> 04:21.345
and got behind the wheel.

04:21.446 --> 04:23.480
And I drove him to the hospital.

04:26.217 --> 04:29.753
I had to leave him there
because the cops showed up.

04:35.493 --> 04:38.262
He was already gone.

04:41.266 --> 04:43.567
I'm sorry.

04:47.038 --> 04:49.506
That's a loss.

04:52.777 --> 04:56.380
Would you recognize
this son of a bitch?

05:01.753 --> 05:05.856
Uh... he's dead.

05:07.425 --> 05:10.227
I ran over him.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.734
You killed him?

05:16.835 --> 05:20.137
I-I happened to see him as
I drove back from the hospital,

05:20.238 --> 05:24.775
and I chased him down an alley
in Ethan's truck...

05:26.478 --> 05:30.013
and I smacked him with it.

05:30.081 --> 05:32.249
I-I know that I should have
talked to you first.

05:32.350 --> 05:36.420
And I hope that--that I
didn't screw anything up for you

05:36.521 --> 05:38.756
or get anyone pissed off at us.

05:38.857 --> 05:42.259
I-I don't know how all the
politics work and everything.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.328
It just, um--

05:48.433 --> 05:52.169
I just knew that piece of shit
killed Ethan.

05:52.270 --> 05:54.238
You stepped up.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.039
You handled things
in the moment.

05:56.141 --> 05:57.274
That's good work.

05:57.342 --> 05:59.343
That means something to me.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.281
Thanks.

06:07.886 --> 06:10.921
Where's Ethan's truck?

06:10.989 --> 06:12.956
I have it.

06:13.057 --> 06:14.925
It's covered in blood.

06:14.993 --> 06:18.395
I'm gonna explain to you
how you're gonna dump it.

06:18.463 --> 06:19.963
There's a gap in the fence

06:20.064 --> 06:22.366
about 3 miles up
the mountain road.

06:22.467 --> 06:25.202
You're gonna drive it through
there and into the woods.

06:25.270 --> 06:27.971
No one's gonna look
for a truck up there.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.941
You make sure the tank's full.

06:31.009 --> 06:34.044
You cover the truck in gasoline,
inside and out.

06:34.112 --> 06:37.047
You're gonna burn away
all the DNA evidence.

06:37.115 --> 06:41.718
Then you put a rag
in the tank...

06:41.820 --> 06:44.021
you light a match, and you get
the hell out of the way.

07:13.685 --> 07:24.375

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

07:37.075 --> 07:39.343
Soon as you're done
admiring your handiwork,

07:39.410 --> 07:41.345
we can get the hell out of here.

07:43.414 --> 07:46.550
Gil sent me to pick you up.
Let's go.

07:46.618 --> 07:50.888
Oh, yeah.
Right.

07:50.989 --> 07:52.990
Let's just go.

07:55.493 --> 07:57.995
So, uh... we gonna
be working together?

07:58.062 --> 08:02.299
Yeah.
Name's Remo.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.067
So, Remo...

08:04.168 --> 08:05.489
how long you been working
for Gil?

08:05.536 --> 08:08.005
A lot longer than you.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.173
23 years.

08:10.275 --> 08:12.509
That's a long time, man.
You must know everything.

08:12.610 --> 08:14.177
Look, spare me the crap,
all right?

08:14.279 --> 08:16.213
I don't need it.
Let's just say it out loud--

08:16.281 --> 08:18.849
I'm a lot older than you.

08:18.917 --> 08:21.051
Okay.
You're older than me.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.253
- A seasoned professional.
- Yeah.

08:23.354 --> 08:24.521
No, you're totally seasoned.

08:24.622 --> 08:26.256
Don't mock me, boy.

08:26.357 --> 08:27.491
I'm not mocking you.

08:27.558 --> 08:28.759
Why do you think
I'm mocking you?

08:28.826 --> 08:31.561
How old are you anyway?
12?

08:32.931 --> 08:35.599
- I'm 21.
- 21.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.568
20-freaking-1.
Unbelievable.

08:38.635 --> 08:41.438
I'm pretty good at this, okay?
I helped Ethan a lot.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.674
I pick stuff up fast.

08:43.741 --> 08:47.244
You're not gonna be sorry
that I'm working for you.

08:47.345 --> 08:50.714
You're not working for me,
dick-head.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.816
I'm working for you.

09:49.674 --> 09:51.174
Oh.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.277
She's completely asleep.
I couldn't wake her.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.279
It's okay.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.115
She needs to sleep right now,
poor thing.

09:58.216 --> 09:59.916
She has to go
to the police with us,

09:59.984 --> 10:01.284
whether she wants to or not.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.020
I mean, I feel bad saying that.

10:03.121 --> 10:04.621
I want to respect
what she's been through,

10:04.689 --> 10:06.623
that she
just wants it all to end,

10:06.691 --> 10:08.291
but she has to participate.

10:08.359 --> 10:10.160
No one will believe us--

10:10.261 --> 10:12.796
that there was an Asian sex
slave ring--without her.

10:12.864 --> 10:15.365
Regardless, we can't go now.
I mean, she's not even awake.

10:15.433 --> 10:16.867
Later, then.

10:16.968 --> 10:18.468
I mean, she's been through
a lot, you know.

10:18.536 --> 10:19.970
- Mm-hmm.
- We have to give her

10:20.071 --> 10:21.705
- some time to recover, and--
- We can't.

10:21.806 --> 10:23.673
That guy's gonna realize
she's gone, and then what?

10:23.775 --> 10:25.275
He's totally dangerous.
He needs to be locked up.

10:25.343 --> 10:27.477
You know, I say we call
the FBI right this second.

10:27.545 --> 10:29.713
We're not gonna do that, Emma.

10:32.350 --> 10:33.750
But don't we have
to move quickly?

10:33.818 --> 10:36.720
Yes, and--
and we will, honey, we will.

10:36.821 --> 10:38.955
Just not right now.

10:39.057 --> 10:40.891
You know, I think Norman's
absolutely right,

10:40.992 --> 10:42.492
let cooler heads prevail,
you know?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.294
We've been through a lot,
all of us.

10:44.362 --> 10:46.663
We're all exhausted,
especially that poor girl.

10:46.731 --> 10:49.666
I don't want to traumatize
her further.

10:49.734 --> 10:53.236
I'll let her sleep today.
I'll go down later and--and--

10:53.337 --> 10:55.072
I'll make a case
to her as to why

10:55.173 --> 10:57.808
it's the right thing to do
to talk to the police, okay?

11:00.078 --> 11:02.145
But later, Emma.
Later.

11:02.213 --> 11:04.281
Okay.

11:09.187 --> 11:10.987
You're okay to drive, right?

11:11.089 --> 11:13.824
Should I call your mom and tell
her that you're leaving now?

11:13.925 --> 11:16.093
Sure, if you can find her.

11:16.194 --> 11:19.196
Actually, I haven't heard
from my mom in eight years.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.868
I'm sorry, Emma.
I didn't know that.

11:24.936 --> 11:27.504
I guess taking care of
a kid with C.F. isn't the--

11:27.572 --> 11:29.706
the good time
it's cracked up to be.

11:29.774 --> 11:32.109
But I have my dad.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.211
I'm sorry.

11:34.312 --> 11:37.214
You deserve better.
You deserve so much better.

12:03.608 --> 12:06.610
You're very brave.

12:06.711 --> 12:08.145
Had I been lucky enough
to have a daughter,

12:08.246 --> 12:11.882
I would have wanted her
to be exactly like you.

12:11.983 --> 12:13.304
I just want to do
the right thing.

12:13.351 --> 12:15.752
I just want to get Jiao
to go to the police.

12:15.853 --> 12:18.555
I know, honey, and I will.
I promise.

12:18.623 --> 12:22.225
Tomorrow, yeah?
Tomorrow.

12:23.494 --> 12:24.794
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:39.277 --> 12:42.746
That was really good,
how you were with her.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.916
There's no way in hell we're
going to the police tomorrow...

12:45.983 --> 12:48.422
or any day,
until we get that belt.

12:54.129 --> 12:55.763
Mom, don't do this.
He's dangerous.

12:55.864 --> 12:57.899
I have to get back
in that house.

12:57.966 --> 13:00.161
You know, I'll wait till he's
asleep, and then I'll find it.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.369
I already looked there.

13:01.470 --> 13:04.472
Well, it's gotta be there.
It's gotta be somewhere.

13:04.573 --> 13:06.073
Well, let me go with you.
You can sneak me in

13:06.141 --> 13:08.476
when he's asleep.
I'll help you.

13:12.147 --> 13:13.481
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you

13:13.582 --> 13:14.862
when you told me about the girl.

13:14.883 --> 13:17.485
I should have trusted you.

13:17.586 --> 13:20.588
You mean more to me
than anyone in the world.

13:24.493 --> 13:27.428
Is there something wrong
with me?

13:27.529 --> 13:30.131
No, honey.
No, I just said that.

13:30.232 --> 13:31.799
I didn't believe you,
and I had--

13:31.867 --> 13:33.234
I had to give you a reason
in the moment.

13:33.335 --> 13:34.735
So there's nothing wrong
with you.

13:34.803 --> 13:37.171
- Do you promise?
- Stop being so dramatic.

13:37.239 --> 13:39.407
We have to--we have to focus
on getting that belt back.

13:39.508 --> 13:41.542
The one that Shelby has?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.515
Girl in the basement
I told you about?

13:47.616 --> 13:48.950
We found her.

13:49.051 --> 13:50.685
He moved her.
Had her hidden on a boat.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.487
She's in the motel.

13:52.588 --> 13:54.021
Does Shelby know she's missing?

13:54.089 --> 13:56.624
No way of knowing.
But Emma's hell-bent

13:56.725 --> 13:58.359
on taking her to the cops
in the morning.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.630
If you turn him in,
then he's gonna turn in Norma.

14:02.731 --> 14:04.665
Where's this boat?

14:04.733 --> 14:06.733
Down in the harbor.
It belonged to Keith Summers.

14:06.735 --> 14:09.537
And that's where Shelby
was hiding her?

14:11.907 --> 14:14.208
Take me to the boat.

14:14.276 --> 14:16.844
Don't go anywhere,
don't talk to anybody, and--

14:16.912 --> 14:18.179
and don't do anything
until we get back.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.115
We're gonna get that belt.

14:21.183 --> 14:23.618
And you can wipe
that lipstick off.

14:33.996 --> 14:37.064
I put down first and last month
on a--on a place today.

14:37.165 --> 14:40.968
Beach bungalow.
It's--it's frickin' awesome.

14:41.036 --> 14:43.671
So you're really gonna do it?
You're really gonna move out?

14:43.739 --> 14:45.139
Already got the keys, yeah.

14:45.207 --> 14:47.475
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
And so are you.

14:47.576 --> 14:50.811
Ocean views.
Two bedrooms.

14:50.913 --> 14:53.714
Got plenty of money coming in,
you know?

14:53.815 --> 14:57.752
Um... no crazy people allowed.

15:01.223 --> 15:03.090
Just, uh--
just live life

15:03.191 --> 15:05.259
the way it's meant to be lived,
you know?

15:05.327 --> 15:08.396
Just peaceful and easy.
Normal.

15:10.332 --> 15:12.600
But what about mom?

15:16.138 --> 15:18.372
You gotta let her go.

15:21.944 --> 15:24.312
She's just gonna bring you down
with her.

15:26.381 --> 15:29.784
Turn here.
The boat's down there.

15:36.391 --> 15:38.392
This is it.

15:57.713 --> 15:59.714
It's down here.

16:01.817 --> 16:04.452
- Where do we look?
- Everywhere.

16:20.268 --> 16:23.270
There's a room downstairs.

16:23.372 --> 16:25.006
Let's go.

16:53.468 --> 16:56.137
Norman, how do you think
your father died?

16:56.204 --> 16:57.772
You know.

16:57.839 --> 16:59.874
This huge shelf in the garage
fell over on him.

16:59.941 --> 17:02.276
You really believe that?

17:02.377 --> 17:04.045
Yeah.

17:04.112 --> 17:06.446
Why?

17:06.548 --> 17:09.583
Pretty freak accident.

17:16.491 --> 17:18.559
Hey, do--

17:18.660 --> 17:20.728
you see a screwdriver anywhere?

17:20.829 --> 17:23.130
There are some tools over here.

17:29.237 --> 17:30.938
Thanks.

17:36.144 --> 17:39.413
I think she killed him,
if you ask me.

17:39.514 --> 17:41.882
- No, she wouldn't do that.
- Look...

17:41.950 --> 17:45.086
you can't see her, okay?
You're--you're too close.

17:45.153 --> 17:47.054
She hated him.
She was miserable.

17:47.155 --> 17:49.924
It wasn't her fault.
He was impossible.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.559
I think she killed him,
took the insurance money,

17:51.660 --> 17:53.160
and got the hell out of there.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.664
No, he was my dad.

17:56.765 --> 17:59.233
She wouldn't have killed
my own dad.

17:59.334 --> 18:00.901
He was just unhappy!
He didn't know

18:00.969 --> 18:03.003
how to deal with anything.
It wasn't his fault.

18:03.071 --> 18:06.674
You can't keep making excuses
for people all the time.

18:06.775 --> 18:08.743
It is their fault, okay?

18:08.810 --> 18:10.444
They--they shouldn't act
the way they do.

18:10.512 --> 18:13.914
He was a bastard,
and she's insane.

18:13.982 --> 18:16.217
Dangerous, even.

18:16.318 --> 18:18.319
You need to see that.

18:29.698 --> 18:31.699
Stick with me, kid.

19:02.931 --> 19:04.465
I had to see you.
I had to see you.

19:04.566 --> 19:06.500
I know, I know,
I know we're not supposed to.

19:06.568 --> 19:08.636
- This is a bad idea.
- I know--no, it's perfect.

19:08.737 --> 19:10.805
We--we were supposed
to be playing it safe.

19:10.906 --> 19:13.941
Not tonight.
I need you so bad.

19:19.381 --> 19:22.750
Eh, oh, but you know what?
I--the boys are gonna be back.

19:22.851 --> 19:24.685
I can't be making out
on my front porch.

19:24.753 --> 19:26.554
Well, that's fine.
We'll go down to the motel.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.189
Come on.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.758
I'm starting to love
that stupid motel.

19:32.594 --> 19:35.095
Yeah.

19:35.197 --> 19:37.464
- What?
- What?

19:37.566 --> 19:38.699
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

19:38.767 --> 19:41.869
No, nothing happened.
Why?

19:41.970 --> 19:45.940
I don't know.
I don't know.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.709
Come on.
Come on, baby.

19:48.777 --> 19:49.977
You're not gonna
turn me away tonight.

19:50.045 --> 19:51.879
- No. Okay.
- Hmm?

19:53.582 --> 19:55.249
- Let's go.
- Okay.

20:02.866 --> 20:04.800
What if it washes up, like the hand?

20:04.868 --> 20:06.969
It's not a hand.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.972
Okay, it's not decomposing,
or gonna get bit off by a fish.

20:10.073 --> 20:12.875
All right? I promise no one's
ever gonna see this thing again.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.519
There.

20:24.587 --> 20:26.588
Now she's safe.

20:31.694 --> 20:33.595
Thanks.

20:33.696 --> 20:36.598
My pleasure.

20:36.699 --> 20:39.902
All right, now let's go home
and pack up your stuff.

20:59.189 --> 21:01.690
What's the matter?

21:01.791 --> 21:03.926
Nothing.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.161
This is nothing like what
we've been doing.

21:06.262 --> 21:08.597
What's wrong?

21:08.665 --> 21:12.534
I, uh--I don't know, uh...

21:15.738 --> 21:19.508
um--I get, um--
I'm just--

21:19.576 --> 21:22.477
I'm just worried about Norman.

21:28.585 --> 21:31.920
You're entitled to ten minutes
off from Norman duty.

21:35.592 --> 21:36.725
I know.

21:36.826 --> 21:39.962
I'm sorry.

21:40.029 --> 21:43.765
- Can we start again?
- Absolutely.

21:52.141 --> 21:54.743
What?

21:54.844 --> 21:57.546
What is that?

21:57.647 --> 21:59.381
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

21:59.482 --> 22:03.151
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

22:07.790 --> 22:11.126
- Who else is staying here?
- Nobody's staying here.

22:14.163 --> 22:16.999
Then there sure as hell
should not be water

22:17.066 --> 22:19.434
running through these pipes.

22:19.502 --> 22:21.770
Well, this place
is 50 years old, Zack.

22:21.871 --> 22:23.872
It's probably some weird
plumbing thing.

22:24.974 --> 22:27.276
No.

22:27.343 --> 22:30.145
No, there's somebody here.

23:18.995 --> 23:20.896
Police!

23:20.997 --> 23:23.265
Open up!

23:26.302 --> 23:27.803
Oh, you know, I forgot.

23:27.904 --> 23:30.439
One of the painters,
he drove up from Sacramento

23:30.540 --> 23:33.108
and I told him that he could--
he could stay over.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.481
Why are you lying to me?

23:39.582 --> 23:42.150
I'm not lying, I just forgot.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.754
No!

23:52.862 --> 23:54.296
Unh!

23:54.397 --> 23:55.564
- Bitch!
- Ugh!

24:31.134 --> 24:33.068
We found the belt, Norma.

24:33.136 --> 24:36.238
We ditched it in the harbor,
so you're home free.

24:38.241 --> 24:41.576
Norman and I are gonna go up to
the house and pack up his stuff.

24:41.677 --> 24:43.678
He's leaving with me tonight.

24:49.352 --> 24:52.154
He's not living
with you anymore.

24:52.255 --> 24:54.623
Well, I mean,
we'll talk about it later.

24:58.995 --> 25:01.263
Shelby's here.

25:01.364 --> 25:03.932
He--he found the girl
in the motel room,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.434
and she ran off into the woods.

25:05.535 --> 25:07.502
He's there right now
chasing after her.

25:07.603 --> 25:08.924
Norman, is what
he just said true?

25:08.971 --> 25:10.839
We need to get the hell
out of here.

25:10.907 --> 25:13.108
- Is what he just said true?
- Yeah, I mean, if Shelby's here

25:13.176 --> 25:16.711
- don't we need to do something?
- Answer me.

25:16.813 --> 25:18.947
Why would you do that, Norman?

25:19.015 --> 25:20.535
We need to go, okay?
Norman, come on.

25:20.550 --> 25:22.417
Let's get in the truck.
Let's go.

25:22.518 --> 25:24.519
- I'm not getting in the truck.
- Mom, let's get in the truck.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.121
I'm not gonna get in the truck.

25:26.189 --> 25:28.390
I don't care if Shelby
comes back and kills me!

25:28.458 --> 25:32.394
- Why would you do that?
- Please, mother.

25:32.462 --> 25:35.564
Norman, why?
Why?

25:38.634 --> 25:40.635
Did you kill my father?

25:45.641 --> 25:49.244
No, honey.
I didn't.

25:49.312 --> 25:51.213
Let's get in the truck now.
We can talk about this later.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.114
- Both of you, we need to go.
- Hold on.

25:53.216 --> 25:56.084
That's not gonna happen.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.322
I know who you work for.

26:00.389 --> 26:02.824
Why don't you take your gun out,
right now.

26:02.925 --> 26:05.727
Two fingers on the handle.

26:05.828 --> 26:07.829
Nice and slow.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.767
You step up,
set that on the ground.

26:19.842 --> 26:21.877
All right,
everybody take a step back.

26:32.388 --> 26:34.556
All right.

26:34.657 --> 26:37.025
Now we're gonna take
a little walk up to the house.

26:37.126 --> 26:39.995
Have a little chat.

26:40.062 --> 26:42.063
Let's go.

26:43.599 --> 26:45.767
Let's go!

26:48.916 --> 26:51.918
What are we gonna do?

26:52.019 --> 26:54.120
What are we gonna do?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.522
God, I cannot believe
that this is happening.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.990
Zack, it's okay.
No one's gonna say anything.

26:58.058 --> 27:00.593
Stop, just--just shut up!

27:17.611 --> 27:20.847
This is all your fault.

27:24.618 --> 27:26.452
I loved your mother,

27:26.520 --> 27:29.288
and I would have
taken care of her...

27:29.356 --> 27:31.457
and you, for the rest
of my life.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.459
Everything would have been fine,
but no, you had to go

27:33.527 --> 27:35.895
and stick your little nose in
places that it doesn't belong.

27:35.996 --> 27:37.630
Let me tell you something!

27:37.698 --> 27:39.799
That is not how things work
around here, you hear me?

27:39.900 --> 27:41.400
No--Zack.

27:41.502 --> 27:43.236
That is how you get
into trouble.

27:43.337 --> 27:45.138
- Guess what?
- No, don't.

27:45.239 --> 27:47.974
- Now you've gotten in trouble.
- Zack, what are you doing?

27:48.075 --> 27:51.911
Zack, just stop.

27:52.012 --> 27:53.746
What are you doing?

27:53.814 --> 27:56.415
This is a nightmare, what
you're making me do here, Norma.

27:56.517 --> 27:58.551
Zack, no one is making you
do anything.

27:58.652 --> 28:01.354
No one's gonna say a word,
I promise. Right?

28:01.455 --> 28:03.556
Isn't that right?
Tell him.

28:06.093 --> 28:07.260
Dylan, tell him.

28:07.361 --> 28:09.028
She--she's right, man.

28:09.096 --> 28:11.430
We're cool, man.

28:11.532 --> 28:12.999
God, you're just a lying bitch!

28:13.100 --> 28:15.902
Oh! Unh!

28:16.003 --> 28:17.570
I loved you!

28:17.638 --> 28:19.572
Then why are you doing this?
Nothing's changed!

28:19.640 --> 28:20.840
No, everything has changed,
Norma!

28:20.908 --> 28:22.441
- No, it hasn't.
- Everything!

28:22.543 --> 28:24.410
- You lied to me!
- I didn't lie to you!

28:24.478 --> 28:26.679
I--it wasn't my fault!
I had no idea the girl was--

28:33.353 --> 28:35.855
How disgusting that is...

28:35.923 --> 28:38.057
- How much of an animal I am?
- I'm so sorry.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.459
- You're sorry?
- Oh!

28:40.561 --> 28:43.129
Oh!

28:46.867 --> 28:49.602
Norman!

28:49.670 --> 28:51.771
Norman!

29:02.015 --> 29:04.951
Are you okay?

29:09.790 --> 29:12.225
Are you okay?

29:12.326 --> 29:15.595
Aah! Unh!

29:21.602 --> 29:24.971
Norman--

29:25.072 --> 29:27.573
Norman, damn it, wake up.

29:32.713 --> 29:35.681
Oh! Ow, unh.

29:35.782 --> 29:37.950
Norman!

30:07.881 --> 30:10.716
Honey, you have to wake up!

30:17.891 --> 30:20.893
Please, Norman, come on.
We have to get out of here.

31:04.271 --> 31:07.773
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Somebody's trying to kill us.

31:07.841 --> 31:09.675
The Bates Motel,
4019 Highway 88.

31:09.776 --> 31:11.243
Please hurry.
Send the police.

31:11.311 --> 31:12.551
Who's trying to kill you?
Ma'am?

31:12.579 --> 31:14.513
- I need you to tell me--
- Okay.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.881
- Norman.
- Mother?

31:15.949 --> 31:18.951
You've gotta walk, okay?
<i>Now.</i>

31:20.120 --> 31:21.754
- What?
- Stand up. Come on.

31:21.855 --> 31:23.723
Nothing's ever been more
important in your entire life.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.691
Come on.
Stand up.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.194
Okay, okay.

31:28.295 --> 31:29.628
Now we gotta walk.

31:29.696 --> 31:32.698
Come on, Norman.
Go this way, this way.

31:41.241 --> 31:44.310
Come on. Come on.

31:44.411 --> 31:46.879
Okay.

31:57.157 --> 31:59.658
What's happened?
My head hurts.

31:59.726 --> 32:03.129
I'll tell you as soon
as I find my car keys.

32:03.230 --> 32:04.730
Where are we going?

32:04.798 --> 32:07.066
No.

32:08.068 --> 32:11.070
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

32:11.171 --> 32:13.906
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I'm an idiot!

32:13.974 --> 32:16.542
Oh, I'm a total idiot!

32:18.345 --> 32:22.615
They're probably in my bedroom.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

32:22.716 --> 32:26.285
Okay, we're gonna walk.
Get out of the car, Norman!

33:36.223 --> 33:39.058
We're safe.

33:55.646 --> 33:59.482
Your boyfriend, Norma.
He was quite the prize.

34:04.689 --> 34:07.190
You need to go to the hospital.

34:07.291 --> 34:09.659
Honestly, I-I was so amped up

34:09.760 --> 34:12.661
that it didn't even really hurt
until just about now.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.130
What's the matter with him?

34:17.250 --> 34:19.835
He'll be fine.

34:19.937 --> 34:21.737
I called the cops.

34:21.806 --> 34:23.840
- Really?
- Mm.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.311
God, what are
we gonna tell them?

34:29.641 --> 34:32.277
We're gonna tell them
the truth, Norma.

34:34.446 --> 34:36.681
I'm done with this.

34:36.782 --> 34:39.784
I'm--I'm done with the craziness
and the stories.

34:41.152 --> 34:42.714
I'm gonna tell them everything
I know.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.355
You don't know.
You don't.

34:44.456 --> 34:46.257
You--you think you do,

34:46.358 --> 34:48.192
but you don't know
the whole truth.

34:48.293 --> 34:50.295
You don't.

34:52.264 --> 34:55.632
What?
What don't--what don't I know?

35:06.478 --> 35:09.647
Let me tell you what happened
that night that Sam died.

35:14.286 --> 35:18.623
We were fighting...

35:21.460 --> 35:23.261
How is it, month after month,

35:23.362 --> 35:28.199
you spend money we don't have
on shit we don't need.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.135
Is this for more clothes?

35:31.203 --> 35:32.704
For the woman
who has more clothes

35:32.771 --> 35:35.039
than a Park Avenue whore?

35:35.140 --> 35:37.408
Yeah, and you know
so much about clothes.

35:37.509 --> 35:39.777
Whores, I'll give that to you,
but--

35:39.845 --> 35:43.214
What's this $300?
You need to refresh your memory.

35:45.584 --> 35:47.251
I bought some curtains.

35:47.319 --> 35:49.420
Oh, good, 'cause it's not like
we have curtains.

35:49.488 --> 35:50.655
Oh, wait a minute.
What are those things

35:50.756 --> 35:52.290
hanging down next to
the windows?

35:52.391 --> 35:53.791
They're ugly, is what it is.

35:53.859 --> 35:56.060
Ugly and old and make
the house look cheap.

35:58.664 --> 36:00.398
You saying
the house looks cheap?

36:00.499 --> 36:02.859
Yes I'm saying the house looks
cheap, because it is cheap!

36:02.935 --> 36:05.636
It reeks of cheap!
I'm trying to brighten it up.

36:05.704 --> 36:07.605
Well, I'm not paying for it.
Take them back.

36:07.706 --> 36:09.987
I'm not taking them back!
You can't just take them back!

36:11.810 --> 36:13.611
Three nights a week

36:13.712 --> 36:15.346
- at the Holiday Inn?
- Oh, I know, it's not

36:15.414 --> 36:17.682
as glamorous as collecting
disability, but--

36:17.783 --> 36:18.950
unh!

36:19.051 --> 36:20.518
Oh! Get off of me!

36:20.619 --> 36:22.120
You'll take that back!

36:22.221 --> 36:23.921
Say it!

36:23.989 --> 36:27.358
You will take that back!

36:27.426 --> 36:29.694
- Who's gonna pay for food?
- Aah!

36:29.795 --> 36:31.362
Who's gonna pay
for electricity?

36:31.430 --> 36:33.698
Say you'll take it back!

36:33.799 --> 36:34.966
- Let go of me!
- Say it!

36:42.775 --> 36:44.909
Oh, God.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.785
Oh, my God.

36:53.886 --> 36:57.688
Oh, my God!

36:57.790 --> 37:01.292
Norman.
Norman, look at me.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.561
Look at me.

37:04.930 --> 37:07.632
Oh, my God.

37:22.214 --> 37:24.382
Oh, jeez.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.152
Norman.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.688
Come on, answer me.

37:30.756 --> 37:32.824
Oh, God.

37:36.628 --> 37:39.197
Oh, God--oh, God.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.304
Okay, come with me.

37:50.008 --> 37:53.411
Norman, sweetheart,
why don't you just rest, okay?

37:53.479 --> 37:55.046
You just lie down.

37:55.147 --> 37:56.681
Hello there,
how have things been?

37:56.782 --> 37:58.416
- Oh, I can't complain.
- I can. I'm hungry.

37:58.484 --> 38:00.885
Get me a roast beef sandwich,
rare, on white toast.

38:00.953 --> 38:03.120
On white bread.
We've gone over this.

38:41.059 --> 38:43.060
Oh!

39:25.904 --> 39:27.438
- Where you gonna live?
- Albany.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.473
Albany, huh?
Got family up there, do you?

39:29.575 --> 39:31.576
No, just my mother.

39:34.012 --> 39:35.613
Mom?

39:45.757 --> 39:48.392
Dad?

39:48.493 --> 39:51.295
Mom!
Mom, open the door!

39:52.564 --> 39:54.632
Mom!

39:54.733 --> 39:56.567
What is it, Norman?

39:56.668 --> 40:00.271
It's dad.
He's--hurry!

40:18.423 --> 40:20.424
Norman?

40:22.861 --> 40:24.929
Norman.

40:34.506 --> 40:37.942
Honey...
I'm so sorry.

40:39.411 --> 40:41.412
Dad.

40:46.985 --> 40:49.987
Sam's death was an accident.
That's what he believes.

40:53.692 --> 40:56.627
What's wrong with him?

40:56.695 --> 40:59.030
I don't know.

40:59.131 --> 41:01.565
Maybe it was
an isolated incident, you know?

41:01.633 --> 41:05.202
All I know is that
he's innocent of it.

41:05.270 --> 41:06.904
He doesn't know what
he was doing,

41:06.972 --> 41:09.340
so he needs to be protected.

41:11.710 --> 41:14.545
So you can either get out
of my way...

41:15.981 --> 41:19.316
or you can help me.
