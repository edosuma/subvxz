DAVID:
In the name of the Father,

00:05.179 --> 00:07.007
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.878
WOMAN: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.054
It's been one day
since my last confession.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.751
These are my sins.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.362
I've been angry at my sister.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.190
I failed to pray the rosary.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.192
I got really mad

00:18.322 --> 00:20.368
in line at the drug store.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.326
...Son, the Holy Spirit.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.502
WOMAN 2: It's been a month
since my last confession.

00:24.633 --> 00:25.938
These are my sins.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.244
I hate my husband.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.811
He puts dishes in the sink

00:28.941 --> 00:30.595
even when I've told
him 100 times

00:30.726 --> 00:32.728
to put them in the dishwasher.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.904
Then he doesn't
take out the garbage.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.645
He thinks it's women's work.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.908
Well, what isn't women's work?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.520
Welcome to the 6:00 a.m. mass.

00:42.651 --> 00:43.913
[churchgoer blows nose]

00:44.044 --> 00:46.263
Let us begin as we always do.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.352
In the name of the Father,

00:48.483 --> 00:50.267
the Son, Holy Spirit.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.747

Amen.

[exhales]

01:18.382 --> 01:19.731
Hello?

01:19.862 --> 01:22.386
Hello.

01:24.606 --> 01:26.173
May I help you?

01:30.264 --> 01:32.396
Do you recognize me?

01:32.527 --> 01:34.311
Victor LeConte?

01:34.442 --> 01:36.226
Do you know what I do?

01:38.489 --> 01:40.752
You work
with the Vatican Secret Service.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.754
The Entity.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.194
There is no Entity, David.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.719
There are merely...
friends of the Vatican.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.852
Some are ambassadors,
some parish priests.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.594
Some work in intelligence--
the CIA,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.988
MI6, DGSE.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.512
They offer
information and assistance.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.211
That's all. There's nothing
mysterious about it.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.083
Is this about RSM Fertility?

02:07.214 --> 02:08.606
[chuckles]

02:08.737 --> 02:10.391
I have a question
for you, David.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.436
You're not going
to answer my question.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.830
Your question is irrelevant.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.615
Why are you a priest?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
To serve God.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.708
What is that?

02:23.839 --> 02:25.754
Your profile.

02:25.884 --> 02:29.627
And do you believe
that you are serving God here?

02:31.847 --> 02:33.892
I don't know.

02:35.242 --> 02:38.027
I don't know what God wants.

02:41.335 --> 02:45.121
Would it surprise you to learn
that I do know what God wants?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.081
Yes.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.519
God wants you to be
a friend of the Vatican.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.654
And... how do I do that?

02:58.090 --> 02:59.701
Say yes.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.139
To?

03:03.270 --> 03:05.489
You want to do good
in the world.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.622
You want to fight evil.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.407
And yet you're bored here.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.454
And you're angry at yourself
for being bored.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.543
But you can't see the connection

03:15.673 --> 03:18.372
between all of these
poorly-attended masses,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
all these confessions

03:20.374 --> 03:22.202
and the evil in the world.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.681
You're watching me?

03:25.030 --> 03:27.032
We don't need to watch you.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.996
There's something happening
in New York that is evil.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.346
As an assessor, you see it.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.435
But it is not just supernatural.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.481
It is also corporeal.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.093
You will receive a call
sometime in the next week,

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
asking you to perform a task.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.445
-What task?
-You will know

03:48.576 --> 03:50.534
that it is from the Vatican
because it will be preceded

03:50.665 --> 03:51.927
by this phrase:

03:52.057 --> 03:53.929
"Is est a Deo habetur."

03:54.973 --> 03:57.280
-"And it is deemed by God."
-You must perform

03:57.411 --> 04:00.152
this task without question--
do you understand?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.026
You're recruiting me?

04:05.288 --> 04:07.551
I need you to say yes.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.559
I need to tell the Monsignor.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.083
No.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.175
It was good to talk to you.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.309
Wait.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.050
You want a yes?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.791
Yes.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.663
And if you say yes,
you cannot tell anyone.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.230
Not the Monsignor,

04:34.361 --> 04:36.058
not your nun friend,
none of your secular associates.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.800
If you say yes, you will be
a friend of the Vatican.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.890
And that is a burden.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.241
But no one is
forcing you to respond.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.112
That is up to you.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.304
KRISTEN: So I did
a little research, and to add

05:04.434 --> 05:07.568
one more bedroom,
it would be 80,000, all in.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.613
-And the bathroom?
-Mm-mmm.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.659
Separate, 90,000.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.487
-Another 90?
-Uh-huh.

05:13.617 --> 05:14.836
We're supposed to be selling
the trekking business

05:14.966 --> 05:16.011
for $85,000.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.142
And we still owe...

05:17.273 --> 05:19.231
80,000 on the mortgage.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.321
Okay, so...

05:21.451 --> 05:23.018
well, I just have
to try and get a job that pays

05:23.148 --> 05:24.498
what, in the range of 75,000?

05:24.628 --> 05:27.414
My job pays 60,000, but...

05:27.544 --> 05:29.154
it also pays
for half the kids' tuition

05:29.285 --> 05:30.852
and our health care.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.202
We could save by sending
the kids to public school.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.247
KRISTEN:
Laura, please!

05:35.378 --> 05:36.858
Mom, they have bomb threats

05:36.988 --> 05:38.338
-at the public school.
-Don't be melodramatic.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.427
-She's not. It's true.
-Mom, the sink is clogged

05:40.557 --> 05:41.950
-again.
-Don't touch it.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.343
-Mom, I want my own room.
-You want your own room?

05:43.473 --> 05:45.040
-[overlapping shouting]
-Guys, guys,

05:45.170 --> 05:46.476
guys, guys!

05:46.607 --> 05:49.000
Unless you girls get jobs
in the coal mines,

05:49.131 --> 05:50.741
this is one for your parents.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.352
-Okay? Okay.
-I'm gonna pass on that.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.875
-Okay, go upstairs.
-You say no to everything.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.920
[overlapping chatter]

05:56.051 --> 05:57.922
-Good night.
-Good night, now.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.533
So I don't... do we just...

05:59.663 --> 06:01.622
do we just hire a contractor
and start in?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.624
Yeah, we got
to get the loans first.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.495
-What about these earnings?
-Oh, that's my mom

06:05.626 --> 06:07.149
-paying 2,000 in the garage.
-No.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.716
-Oh, God, no.
-No, I'm not advocating for it.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.545
I'm saying that's, you know...
strike that.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.329
[sighs]

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
Okay, so I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna try

06:15.331 --> 06:17.289
get a higher price
for the business.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.385
Don't worry, I'm not asking you

07:53.516 --> 07:55.431
to break the seal of confession.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.955
I heard it
from outside the oratory.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.175
There was
another youth filming it.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.786
-Why?
-The usual: social media.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.049
It's not just our parish.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.442
I've been hearing
from other pastors

08:06.573 --> 08:08.923
that are dealing
with the same thing.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.795
Consecrated hosts being stolen.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.841
And this.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.455
DAVID:
"Praise Wandering Jack."

08:19.586 --> 08:21.501
-What's that?
-No idea.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.329
I can't find anything about it
online, and some parents

08:24.460 --> 08:26.723
are calling the school,
worried about it.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.902
Just have your assessors
look into it.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.338
-Look into what?
-This meme.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.602
This... blasphemy.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.212
It's just kids.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.822
It dies out on its own.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.433
Or it's Slender Man.

08:44.654 --> 08:48.136
A freshman committed suicide
last week at St. Andre's.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.792
His parents think he got
caught up in something online.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.578
Okay.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.627
I heard Victor LeConte was here.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.368
Really?

09:04.587 --> 09:06.110
Did he approach you?

09:06.241 --> 09:08.025
Me?

09:08.156 --> 09:09.766
No. [chuckles]

09:09.897 --> 09:12.029
What did he want?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.555
No idea.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.948
Tell me if he approaches you.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.212
Certainly.

09:23.867 --> 09:24.955
KRISTEN: It's called what?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.522
DAVID: Wandering Jack.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.306
It's supposedly
some Internet meme.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.004
-[toilet flushes]
-BEN: Well, there's no blood.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.440
Mom, it was all blood before.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.833
Well, it's gone now.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.312
-What are you two doing?
-Oh, um,

09:34.443 --> 09:36.576
we're working on my toilet.
So,

-this is a possession or...
-[line clicks]

09:38.708 --> 09:40.536
I don't know, uh...

09:43.887 --> 09:45.933
I-I'll call you back.
I got to get this.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.371
Hello?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.331
Hello?

09:53.462 --> 09:55.290
[line clicks]

09:59.468 --> 10:01.165
I'll take a look at the pipes.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.863
You might have something
clogged up there.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.691
That's okay,
I can just call a plumber.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.693
Wait, but I thought you said
you couldn't afford a plumber,

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
-because we...
-Oh, Laura.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.957
I'll take a look tomorrow.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.220
What did, uh, David call about?

10:12.350 --> 10:14.352
Um, this thing online called...

10:14.483 --> 10:16.833
Wandering Jack,
Whistling Jack...

10:16.964 --> 10:19.270
-Visiting Jack?
-What?

10:19.401 --> 10:21.272
The meme's called Visiting Jack.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.100
[girls chattering indistinctly]

10:23.231 --> 10:25.537
Wait, wait, what is this?

10:25.668 --> 10:26.974
It's this thing on the Internet

10:27.104 --> 10:28.366
where you say his name
three times...

10:28.497 --> 10:29.803
No, no, if when
you see him at night

10:29.933 --> 10:31.500
-if there's a full moon.
-LAURA: Yeah.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.457
I thought
your friend saw it, Ren.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.458
Shut up.

10:33.589 --> 10:34.503
Hey, don't say shut up.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.809
Who's Ren?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.419
-Someone from St. Andre's!
-Ooh!

10:37.549 --> 10:39.769
It's a boy that Lynn's dating.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.423
LYNN: I'm not...
I'm not dating anyone.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.946
No, I'm not! Stop! I'm not...

10:43.077 --> 10:44.556
Okay, okay, hey,
hold on, hold on!

10:44.687 --> 10:46.210
What did this boy see?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.778
What's Visiting Jack?

10:48.909 --> 10:51.215
NARRATOR [on video]: Death
is a source of dread for some.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.697
For others, it is perceived as
a release from one's emotional

10:54.828 --> 10:56.917
or physical suffering.

10:57.047 --> 11:00.224
In many religions,
death is not the end of life

11:00.355 --> 11:03.227
at all, but rather
a gateway to something new.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.360
Perhaps leading to the ultimate
judgement of one's

11:05.490 --> 11:07.318
character and moral choices.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.017
However you interpret death,
the fact is,

11:10.147 --> 11:12.149
it is
an inevitable part of life.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.803
Because of this...

11:13.934 --> 11:15.413
Hi, Renold.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.154
I'm Kristen Bouchard.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.287
I've been sent
by the parish to

23:46.250 --> 23:48.427
And I have
to be on time with the food.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.429
This your handwriting?

23:50.559 --> 23:52.213
Yeah, but he told me
to write them down...

23:52.343 --> 23:53.823
Yeah, bullshit!
You're Visiting Jack.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.564
-I'm not.
-You know, someone

23:55.695 --> 23:57.523
committed suicide because
of your bullshit, asshole?

23:57.653 --> 24:00.264
Not mine. I'm not.
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

24:00.395 --> 24:01.265
What are you gonna do,
call Visiting Jack?

24:01.396 --> 24:03.616
Get out! Get out! Get out!

24:03.746 --> 24:04.747
Get out!

24:04.878 --> 24:06.793
[car horns honking]

24:09.578 --> 24:11.580
[tires screeching]

24:18.108 --> 24:20.110
[organ music playing faintly]

24:33.428 --> 24:35.778
[organ music grows louder]

24:43.482 --> 24:45.266
You're not wearing your collar.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.137
-What?
-Keep your voice low.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.400
You'll have to lean in.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.055
You're not wearing your collar.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.971
I-I don't, uh, usually.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.669
It, uh, draws attention.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.540
Wear it.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.281
You will receive a call
telling you

25:00.411 --> 25:02.849
where to deliver this.

25:02.979 --> 25:05.199
-A Bible?
-Yes.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.463
Don't open it.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.119
Is this legal?

25:12.249 --> 25:13.947
According to the laws
of which country?

25:15.035 --> 25:16.427
This one.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.908
Do you have
a sick call traveling case?

25:19.039 --> 25:21.345
-Yes.
-Carry it.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.391
Within a few days,
you'll receive a call

25:23.522 --> 25:25.480
telling you
where to deliver that Bible.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.308
It might be a hotel room.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.440
It might be a bus stop.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.573
Keep it with you at all times.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.227
Wear a collar.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.968
And deliver it.

25:42.628 --> 25:43.977
I-I-I don't understand.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.109
I saw him.
I-I saw Visiting Jack.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.024
LYNN:
No. It was, it was a guy dressed

25:48.155 --> 25:50.287
in a demon outfit
to scare people away.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.855
-Well, how do you know that?
-My mom went to the guy.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.596
He's a college student
who's homeless

25:54.727 --> 25:56.424
and just staying at this house.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.426
-But the licks?
-He made them all up.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.080
He's just trying to get upvotes.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.257
Look.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.085
Here he is.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.869
See?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.002
He's just some college kid.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.918
You're scared of nothing, Ren.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.876
-Come on out.
-Did you look at the picture?

26:14.007 --> 26:15.486
-What picture?
-Of Visiting Jack.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.010
Yeah. It's just a costume.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.315
Well, what about
the other houses?

26:18.446 --> 26:20.404
What houses?

26:20.535 --> 26:21.754
The other six.
Was he there, too?

26:21.884 --> 26:23.233
I don't know what you're
talking about.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.757
REN:
There were six other places.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.628
Visiting Jack was
at all of them.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.325
And he killed every family
that didn't do the tasks.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.156
Your mom is there, too,
isn't she?

26:33.287 --> 26:35.115
Let me see her.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.073
Ren, this guy's a scam artist.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.814
He's just trying
to manipulate kids online.

26:38.945 --> 26:39.815
Listen,

26:39.946 --> 26:42.601
Visiting Jack is real.

26:42.731 --> 26:45.516
And you let Lynn see him.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.258
Now she has five days. Help her.

26:48.389 --> 26:49.999
-Ren, he's not real
-Yes, it is real.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.610
Look at the other six homes.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.437
Where are they?
How can I find them?

26:54.917 --> 26:56.963
Ren, if you want to help
my daughter, you got

26:57.093 --> 26:59.313
to convince me.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.664
BEN:
How did he find these?

27:02.795 --> 27:04.840
I don't know.
He's on the Internet a lot.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.102
-BEN: Hmm.
-Mom?

27:06.233 --> 27:08.061
Maybe I'll wait in the car.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.932
Okay, sure.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.760
-I'll be out in a minute.
-Okay.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.284
[keys jingling]

27:14.415 --> 27:16.417
BEN:
Hmm.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.593
[door creaks open]

27:20.682 --> 27:22.641
[door closes]

27:23.729 --> 27:25.252
There.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.735
Is somebody else doing this?

27:29.865 --> 27:31.954
-ROSA: Or...?
-Or what?

27:32.085 --> 27:33.608
I don't know. Is it real?

27:33.739 --> 27:35.741
Try the next one.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.443
Hmm.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.360
KRISTEN:
I mean, it could be Photoshop.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.189
Or, you know,
some kind of deepfake.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.321
BEN:
Maybe.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.303
ROSA:
How do you explain that?

28:30.447 --> 28:32.536
Here we go.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.495
-You don't have a beer?
-[laughs]

28:34.625 --> 28:36.366
Kristen buys these by the case.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.673
But now
that I'm here permanently,

28:38.804 --> 28:40.414
I'm gonna replace it with beer.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.590
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.812
Oh, my God.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.857
Yeah, I know, no.
You get used to it.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.294
So, what's going on?

28:51.425 --> 28:53.470
Well...

28:53.601 --> 28:55.429
I need more money
for the business.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.824
-We decided on $85,000.
-No.

28:58.954 --> 29:02.044
We decided that was a good
starting point for negotiation.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.830
I'm gonna need
$110,000 at least.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.702
Well, what if I told you...

29:07.833 --> 29:09.486
that there's somebody
who wanted to pay

29:09.617 --> 29:10.749
full freight for the business?

29:10.879 --> 29:12.098
What is full freight?

29:12.228 --> 29:14.448
$800,000.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.493
-You're kidding.
-No.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.452
Why would they pay that?

29:18.582 --> 29:20.889
That... it's the new economy.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.848
-What?
-Okay, some billionaire

29:22.978 --> 29:24.501
wants to scale our business.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.112
It's like
those spaceship billionaires.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.504
Everybody's into adventure
these days.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.158
-Who? Who is this person?
-Some VC.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.421
He-he wants to meet you.
He's got some questions.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.772
[sighs]

29:33.902 --> 29:35.817
-[chuckles]
-BEN: Wow.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.645
I have the sudden urge to bow.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.169
Father Acosta.

29:41.954 --> 29:45.044
I'm sorry
I abandoned you guys yesterday.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.524
-Was somebody dying?
-No. Just the job.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.658
So... sounded like
you guys solved it.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.920
BEN: Yeah, but then
we ran into a snag.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.052
Yeah.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.923
DAVID:
Hmm.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.969
Yeah, these are pretty spooky.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.797
BEN: Yeah, so we just
discovered something else.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.016
Yeah, we're only four houses in,
but, so far,

30:01.147 --> 30:02.801
these four are
all connected to a murder.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.628
Or suicide. This was a couple

30:04.759 --> 30:06.195
that was, uh, killed
in a home invasion.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.328
This is arson-- three dead.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.721
Suicide. Two hangings.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.898
So the kids that did this
just cherry-picked the houses

30:13.028 --> 30:14.508
that had violent deaths
to make it look

30:14.638 --> 30:16.075
like Visiting Jack was culpable.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.599
Yeah, probably,
but the question remains...

30:18.729 --> 30:21.384
how did they put
Visiting Jack in each

30:21.515 --> 30:23.212
-of these street-view pictures?
-BEN: Mm-hmm.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.388
-DAVID: How about this one?
-BEN: What about it?

30:25.519 --> 30:27.173
KRISTEN:
Kind of hard to see the house.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.783
DAVID: Yeah, but there's
someone in the driveway. Look.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.219
Mm.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.569
Maybe we should ask her
what she saw.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.143
BEN:
Okay.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.580
So the address is...

30:43.711 --> 30:45.278
on Frost.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.280
What?

30:47.410 --> 30:49.108
The violent crime occurred
a few months ago.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.631
-It was...
-Orson LeRoux.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.157
Yeah, it was, uh...

30:55.288 --> 30:57.420
where he was killed.

30:58.421 --> 31:01.685
Well, we should look
at the other houses.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.731
This is Emily in the picture.
It's his widow.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.342
She inherited the house.
We should go talk to her.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.171
-We can do that, Kristen...
-We can do... You don't ha...

31:09.302 --> 31:10.607
No. Let's go.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.308
LILA: I mean, do you have to
take a picture or something...

31:15.438 --> 31:17.223
[girls talking over one another]

31:17.353 --> 31:18.877
LAURA:
How long till you're,

31:19.007 --> 31:20.661
-like, done with it, like...?
-Uh, until Monday.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.445
And you do you really think
you'll be dead if you don't?

31:22.576 --> 31:24.317
No, I just think
it's a challenge,

31:24.447 --> 31:26.362
so it's better
to do it than not.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.147
Then go to the church
after school.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.279
And shout
"Captain Kirk is Christ"?

31:30.410 --> 31:32.238
-[laughter]
-They'll know it's me.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.675
[toilet flushing]

31:36.807 --> 31:40.028
Just, like, go to the Christian
church, the ugly one.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.769
They never said
it had to be Catholic.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.250
What are the other tasks?

31:44.380 --> 31:46.513
LYNN:
I have to hit a teacher.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.384
[scoffs]

31:49.516 --> 31:51.779
-LAURA: What if it's a joke?
-What do you mean?

31:57.263 --> 31:59.047
-[loud grunt]
-Hit a teacher with this.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.701
You just, like, punch...

32:00.831 --> 32:02.572
LILA: Oh, yeah, hit
the old one and then laugh.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.618
-It'll be like a joke.
-Can I see the list?

32:04.748 --> 32:06.576
-No, no, no, no.
-Why?

32:06.707 --> 32:07.926
They're not all for kids.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.840
Like what?

32:09.971 --> 32:12.756
Like, I have to steal alcohol
from Mom and Dad and drink it.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.454
That's not so bad.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.499
Mom won't miss a margarita.
Come on, let's go.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.024
-I mean, if it's that easy...
-Come on, let's go, Lynn.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.416
-He's late.
-[laughs]

32:20.547 --> 32:22.244
He has $800,000.
He can afford to be late.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.724
-Hey, no, no, no, no.
-Guys.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.639
-[overlapping chatter]
-Do you have to be here?

32:25.769 --> 32:27.597
We're getting
some milk, come on!

32:27.728 --> 32:28.598
Okay, real quick,
but drink it upstairs. Okay.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.165
No, Dad, Mom says

32:30.296 --> 32:31.471
-no drinks upstairs.
-BASH: He's coming on!

32:31.601 --> 32:33.516
Okay, stay in there.
Just be quiet.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.996
LAURA:
It's fine, just do it.

32:35.127 --> 32:35.910
-Lynn, just do it.
-I'll open it for you.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.085
No, I got it.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.608
Come on, chug it like Mom.

32:38.739 --> 32:39.827
She won't even notice it.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.829
[sighs]

32:41.960 --> 32:43.483
[pops tab]

32:43.613 --> 32:45.528
Okay. [slurping]

32:45.659 --> 32:47.400
-You're doing it.
-Oh, my gosh.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.054
-You're crazy.
-[laughter, clamoring]

32:49.184 --> 32:51.143
-I can't believe you did it.
-Oh, my God.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.144
-You did it!
-[banging on door]

32:52.274 --> 32:53.667
-Shh!
-Um...

32:53.797 --> 32:55.538
sorry, Eddie,
I didn't quite catch that.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.279
I said, in my other businesses,

32:57.410 --> 32:59.760
there has always been one key.

32:59.890 --> 33:03.285
To learn hands-on
from the originator.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.374
I'm sorry, I don't quite follow.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.898
I need you to go
with me to Nepal.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.422
Show me the ins and outs
of your business.

33:09.552 --> 33:12.164
Oh, sir, no,
um, Bash can do that.

33:12.294 --> 33:14.166
I have taken
my last trip to Nepal.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.951
[chuckles] Why? Why, should
I not be investing in Nepal?

33:17.082 --> 33:18.909
No, no. It's just
that I have a family, sir.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.000
And, um... I've already been
away for so long.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.176
Well, as much
as I sympathize, sir.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.656
I am offering
to buy your business

33:26.787 --> 33:29.094
for $800,000.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.270
-Say yes, fucker, say yes.
-And all I require is for you

33:31.400 --> 33:33.750
-to show me the ropes.
-Uh, sir, with respect,

We'll be in touch.

48:10.583 --> 48:13.586
Dad said you drank
one of my margaritas.

48:16.154 --> 48:18.156
I don't want you doing that.

48:19.157 --> 48:21.681
I'm sorry.

48:24.727 --> 48:26.904
I read the seven tasks.

48:27.034 --> 48:28.601
The Visiting Jack tasks.

48:28.731 --> 48:29.994
I know it's one of them.

48:30.124 --> 48:31.430
I don't believe in that anymore.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.040
Task number four

48:33.171 --> 48:35.347
was "have sex with a virgin."

48:35.477 --> 48:37.697
I didn't get that far, Mom.

48:39.307 --> 48:40.700
Did Ren?

48:42.310 --> 48:44.530
We didn't have sex.

48:46.140 --> 48:47.576
We didn't.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.845
I want to believe you, Lynn.

48:55.976 --> 48:58.848
But you cannot lie to me.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.590
I won't.

49:03.288 --> 49:05.725
[pipes rumbling]

49:05.855 --> 49:07.118
[toilet flushes]

49:07.248 --> 49:08.728
That's the toilet.

49:09.729 --> 49:12.471
-I'll get on it.
-[chuckles softly]

49:20.783 --> 49:22.002
Have you thought about it?

49:24.439 --> 49:25.875
And?

49:28.443 --> 49:30.619
This is your last trek?

49:30.750 --> 49:33.535
[breathes deeply]
Yeah.

49:33.666 --> 49:35.320
And for how long?

49:35.450 --> 49:36.451
Three months.

49:36.582 --> 49:37.626
Oh, boy.

49:39.019 --> 49:40.455
[sighs]

49:41.761 --> 49:43.241
Well,

49:43.371 --> 49:46.374
it's an insane amount of money,
and...

49:47.593 --> 49:50.161
...we need money, so I don't...

49:51.597 --> 49:53.381
I don't really see
how we can say no.

49:53.512 --> 49:54.948
ANDY:
Mm-hmm.

49:57.516 --> 50:00.214
-I don't want to go.
-I know you don't.

50:00.345 --> 50:02.564
Just don't die.

50:02.695 --> 50:05.872
-Okay.
-[chuckles softly]

50:06.003 --> 50:07.656
And get half the money up front.

50:07.787 --> 50:09.093
We have to start
on that bathroom.

50:09.223 --> 50:10.703
I will.

50:11.747 --> 50:14.315
I love you so much.

50:14.446 --> 50:16.448
[whispers]:
I love you, too.

50:18.711 --> 50:20.539
-[Kristen sighs]
-Oh.

50:20.669 --> 50:22.367
[crying]: Being a single mom
just really sucks.

50:22.497 --> 50:23.933
I know. I know.

50:24.064 --> 50:25.239
[Kristen sniffles]

50:25.370 --> 50:27.372
It's almost over.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.725
