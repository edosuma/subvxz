00:01.730 --> 00:04.070
Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:04.100 --> 00:05.730
Halima Nair made that film

00:05.770 --> 00:07.980
to introduce
our cultural treasures

00:08.010 --> 00:10.380
to your great nation.
[applause]

00:13.910 --> 00:15.310
[hatch clatters]

00:15.310 --> 00:18.180
<i>You spent four months
in a dangerous country</i>

00:18.210 --> 00:19.510
pleading for our dad's life.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.200
Arif switched you with
another enemy of the State.

00:23.580 --> 00:27.080
<i>Your blood won't be
on my hands.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:29.180
James Timmons, I'm an attorney.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.270
If I can be of help...

00:30.300 --> 00:32.430
I think the reward for an
escaped prisoner is the same

00:32.450 --> 00:33.570
whether he is alive or dead.

00:34.420 --> 00:36.060
We will develop
these fields

00:36.250 --> 00:38.650
<i>with our new friends
from China.</i>

00:38.730 --> 00:41.230
You want to assassinate
the president. Boom.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.040
An oil reserve is a gift of...

00:43.040 --> 00:45.650
[gunshot]
[bullet cuts through air]

00:45.650 --> 00:48.150
<i>The man who did
this is a terrorist.</i>

00:48.430 --> 00:49.710
By the time
you wake up tomorrow,

00:49.740 --> 00:52.440
we will have this man's
head on a stick.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.890
Where are the figs?
[people chattering in background]

01:01.890 --> 01:03.740
[people chattering in background]

01:03.740 --> 01:05.110
I told you to buy figs.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.240
Or did I just imagine
having that conversation?

01:07.280 --> 01:08.380
I was about to.

01:08.410 --> 01:09.680
You're always "about to",

01:09.710 --> 01:10.910
because I'm always
reminding you.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.780
Okay, so we have a system.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.190
Why is everything
a joke with you?

01:15.220 --> 01:16.390
What's wrong with jokes?

01:16.420 --> 01:18.350
They're not figs... Now
go back and get them.

01:18.390 --> 01:20.110
But they're on the
other side of the market.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.430
You should have thought
of that before. Go.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.190
We'll be in the cafÃ©
across the street.

01:24.230 --> 01:25.890
Okay, I'll go.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.930
[low hum of chattering]
[items clattering]

01:28.930 --> 01:30.610
I worry about
my sister sometimes.

01:30.630 --> 01:32.340
Check out hashtag
"IhabRocks."

01:32.370 --> 01:34.170
It's trending like crazy.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.070
Going after Al Fayeed
like that is a mistake.

01:36.110 --> 01:37.860
Is it?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.570
[scoffs] Because I'm thinking of
putting down my paint can

01:39.600 --> 01:41.040
and picking up a gun.

01:41.070 --> 01:42.320
Shut up, Marwan.

01:43.450 --> 01:44.910
The one thing
we've always said

01:44.950 --> 01:46.180
is that violence won't
bring down the regime.

01:46.220 --> 01:49.080
But graffiti and anonymous
chat rooms will?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.490
Eventually, yes.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.100
Eventually, enough people
will speak up

01:52.120 --> 01:54.090
until we're too loud
for them to ignore.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.760
All violence brings
is more violence.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.040
I'm not so sure anymore.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.250
I'm getting coffee.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.400
Jamal can shut down Twitter

02:04.430 --> 02:06.400
a... and paint
over graffiti,

02:06.440 --> 02:08.400
but he can't stop
a bullet.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.560
[soldier] Copy that.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.060
Open the checkpoint,
we're moving out.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.590
We're moving out!
Everybody to move out!

02:13.590 --> 02:16.590
[soldiers continue talking to each other]

02:16.590 --> 02:18.590
[engine revving]

02:18.590 --> 02:22.590
[vehicles approaching]

02:26.320 --> 02:29.270
Your son, he was
our bravest fighter.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.330
[sighs deeply]

02:33.330 --> 02:36.830
Malik grew up hearing my
stories about uncles and cousins

02:36.860 --> 02:40.550
he never met because of
the Al Fayeeds.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.570
His hatred, it came from me.

02:45.370 --> 02:47.370
It's my fault he's dead.

02:47.410 --> 02:49.040
No, no.

02:50.190 --> 02:54.060
Because of your son's sacrifice,
our numbers are already growing.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.580
[cell phone ringing]

02:57.580 --> 02:59.250
Please.

02:59.290 --> 03:00.850
Excuse me.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.420
[ringing continues]
[cell phone beeps]

03:02.420 --> 03:03.220
Namir.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.950
I'm at the Hamsa checkpoint.

03:04.970 --> 03:07.710
All the soldiers just piled
into their trucks and drove off.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.940
Why?

03:09.100 --> 03:11.360
No idea. I was
too far away to hear.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.640
[static sound]

03:12.640 --> 03:14.330
Namir?
[static sound]

03:14.370 --> 03:15.540
N...

03:15.570 --> 03:17.140
Give me your phone.

03:19.110 --> 03:21.410
[engine roaring]

03:21.410 --> 03:23.040
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

03:23.080 --> 03:23.920
What?

03:23.940 --> 03:25.230
It's the military.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.630
They're jamming our phones.
They're getting out of Ma'an.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.050
I don't understand, Ihab.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.180
Listen up, everyone!

03:30.220 --> 03:31.820
We need to get
to shelter right now.

03:31.850 --> 03:33.630
Don't ask me
any questions, just go.

03:33.650 --> 03:34.790
Now!

03:35.090 --> 03:36.090
Come.

[panicked shouting]

03:45.330 --> 03:46.370
Wait.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.070
I have to find my sister.

<i>Jada!</i>

04:02.150 --> 04:04.050
Jada!

04:04.080 --> 04:06.420
- My eyes, they're burning.
- I have you.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.750
Come.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.360
[Jada coughing]
[panicked shouting continues]

04:09.360 --> 04:11.230
Help!

04:11.260 --> 04:12.890
Someone help! Jada.

Help, please!

Gianluca Belfiglio

05:17.320 --> 05:20.320
[footsteps tapping]

05:28.860 --> 05:31.830
I said there was
to be no gas.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.700
No, Mr. President, you
instructed me to destroy Ihab

05:36.720 --> 05:39.020
and his insurgency
by any means necessary.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.300
Don't play word
games with me.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.350
You knew what I meant.

05:43.780 --> 05:45.180
I knew what you wanted,
and I gave it to you.

05:45.180 --> 05:47.080
Behind my back.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.350
I'm the President.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.220
And when they ask you if
you ordered the attack,

05:50.260 --> 05:53.000
and you say no, you'll
be telling the truth.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.400
I'm doing for you now what I
did for your father 25 years ago.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.400
[Tariq gasping and chocking]

06:00.700 --> 06:03.570
You are going to hell, Uncle.

06:04.370 --> 06:05.670
Of course I am.

06:06.590 --> 06:08.800
I promised your father
I'd always look after you.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.310
You have two choices, Jamal.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.180
Kill me now and tell the world

06:14.210 --> 06:16.180
your general made war
without you knowing,

06:16.430 --> 06:20.160
or you deny complicity
to the world

06:20.190 --> 06:21.760
and blame it on the enemy.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.190
Some will believe you,
others won't.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.420
But eventually
no one will care anymore.

06:28.790 --> 06:32.060
Then you can rule this
country however you want,

06:32.100 --> 06:34.060
as your father did before you.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.580
But as of this morning,

06:37.100 --> 06:40.270
you have no more
opposition in Abuddin.

No...

07:20.210 --> 07:21.110
Ah, shit.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.710
Kasim!

08:03.140 --> 08:05.910
- When did you get back?
- Last night. It was late.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.310
But you and Munir weren't
home when I woke up.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.420
We, uh...
We slept outside.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.570
How come?

08:11.600 --> 08:12.860
It was a beautiful night.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.550
I have to get to work,
okay? [chuckles]

08:15.280 --> 08:16.450
Kasim?

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Your backpack,

08:19.540 --> 08:21.300
it's leaking.
What's in there?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
Nothing.

08:23.710 --> 08:24.710
Show me.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.510
You're not my mother.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.650
I'm your father's wife,
and I asked you a question.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.150
It's just some stuff, okay?
Work stuff.

08:33.659 --> 08:35.830
You're a bad liar, Kasim.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.830
[zipping sound]

08:42.720 --> 08:44.550
He's still not holding down
any water.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.260
You said not to tell anyone!

08:47.300 --> 08:49.060
I didn't tell her, you ass.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.560
[Bassam sighs]

08:52.440 --> 08:54.070
You found him
in the desert?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.300
Without identification
or food?

08:57.340 --> 08:59.410
Just that smelly
prison uniform.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.640
He says he escaped.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.670
We figured the government
would pay for him.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.320
[sighs]

Fluids.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.720
He told us what
to get from the clinic.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.990
Says he was an army medic.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.590
Get your father.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.450
And don't talk
about this to anyone.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.580
[Bassam sighs]

09:19.580 --> 09:21.310
Here, let me.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.280
[Bassam] It needs to be...

10:40.740 --> 10:42.120

10:42.150 --> 10:43.420
This is a vicious
trick by the Rashids,

10:43.440 --> 10:45.840
and the media's
falling right into it.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.620
I understand.

10:53.310 --> 10:55.550
You're a curator,
not a politician.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.490
The Santa Croce Marbles?

11:03.110 --> 11:04.690
No, I've never heard of them.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.300
How exciting.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.160
Of course not.

11:15.490 --> 11:16.840
The treasures of
Abuddin have survived

11:16.870 --> 11:18.070
a thousand years.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.810
One more year
won't make a difference.

11:25.020 --> 11:27.070
[quietly] French,
righteous bitch.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.190
Excuse us, Nabila.

11:36.370 --> 11:38.300
And can you
stop using plastic, please?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.940
[Jamal clears throat]

11:42.940 --> 11:45.420
That was the French
curator of the Louvre.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.530
I assumed.

11:48.110 --> 11:49.620
I'm very sorry, Leila.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.110
Have you ever heard of
the Santa Croce Marbles?

11:53.140 --> 11:55.110
- No.
- Me neither.

11:55.150 --> 11:57.940
Apparently getting them was
a real coup for the museum,

11:58.750 --> 12:00.740
so they've postponed
our exhibition.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.250
Not a political decision at all.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.870
It's not easy,
sometimes, is it?

12:11.060 --> 12:12.690
I have to cancel
all the other events

12:12.730 --> 12:14.570
I've planned around
the opening:

12:15.170 --> 12:16.800
the Cultural Diplomacy Conference,

12:16.830 --> 12:18.330
the interviews,
the photo shoots.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.390
The students are going
to be very disappointed.

12:22.370 --> 12:23.600
And what about you?

12:24.230 --> 12:26.440
Do you want to talk about
what happened?

12:26.470 --> 12:28.030
What's there to talk about?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.210
[sighs deeply]

12:32.210 --> 12:34.270
You were asleep
when I went to see Tariq,

12:34.290 --> 12:37.080
and you were gone
when I got back.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.360
Nabila said you're meeting
the Chinese ambassador.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.130
Don't be late.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.130
[footsteps departing]

12:52.330 --> 12:54.670
If I'm going to be a minister
in my father's government,

12:54.920 --> 12:56.170
I need to look the part.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.040
Especially with
all that's happening.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.420
Make me look
respectable, Sharif.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.810
[Jamal] <i>My mandate</i>

13:03.840 --> 13:05.010
to my generals

13:05.050 --> 13:06.510
has always been the same:

13:06.820 --> 13:08.050
a precise, punishing,

13:08.080 --> 13:10.240
but proportionate response.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.850
The photos and videos
on social media...

13:11.850 --> 13:12.990
I'm sure you've seen them.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.460
Well, I... I don't need
to look at pictures.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.300
Mr. Ambassador,

13:17.860 --> 13:20.490
our intelligence
is investigating

13:20.530 --> 13:22.460
whether Ihab Rashid
was storing

13:22.500 --> 13:25.180
chemical weapons
among his munitions.

13:25.270 --> 13:28.490
So your mortars hit
<i>their</i> chemical weapons?

13:28.490 --> 13:30.190
[clears throat]

13:30.190 --> 13:31.710
Mr. Ambassador,

13:32.740 --> 13:34.730
our intelligence

13:35.600 --> 13:37.100
has confirmed

13:37.910 --> 13:40.550
the insurgency is broken.

13:40.580 --> 13:43.500
Which means
our oil fields are secure.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.090
My government will insist

13:54.130 --> 13:56.530
on a full and fair
U.N. investigation

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
before we resume
developing the oil fields.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.730
Of course.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.220
But once that happens,

14:03.500 --> 14:05.600
I anticipate
we'll continue on schedule.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.590
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

14:11.660 --> 14:12.700
Mr. President.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.700
[footsteps departing]

14:17.700 --> 14:20.670
[door opens, hinges squeak]
[door closes]

14:20.670 --> 14:21.900
Is that really
what happened?

14:22.430 --> 14:24.330
We hit their
chemical weapons?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.270
You heard what I told him.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.710
If you had gassed them,

14:33.390 --> 14:34.870
just so you know,

14:34.900 --> 14:36.920
I would have said it was
the right thing to do.

14:38.910 --> 14:40.060
It's what
I would have done.

14:40.060 --> 14:43.330
[Jamal sighs deeply]

14:43.330 --> 14:45.240
After what
they did yesterday...

14:47.210 --> 14:48.660
I think they deserved it.

14:50.270 --> 14:52.240
We don't gloat, Ahmed.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.390
Not over the death
of innocents.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.250
Not even when
they are the enemy.

14:57.450 --> 14:58.810
Whatever.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.540
The point is, it's over.

15:03.490 --> 15:04.790
You took care of it.

15:05.730 --> 15:06.810
Yes.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.190
I took care of it.

15:12.190 --> 15:15.190
[footsteps departing]

15:15.190 --> 15:18.190
[door opens]

15:20.190 --> 15:22.190
[door closes]

15:26.290 --> 15:29.290
[people chatting indistinctly in distance]

15:29.290 --> 15:32.290
[chewing food]

15:38.880 --> 15:40.850
Careful, or you'll choke.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.800
You told my sons you
were a medic in the army.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.060
You didn't tell them
why you were in prison.

16:00.730 --> 16:01.990
I was, um...

16:02.790 --> 16:04.400
uh, I was a deserter.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.280
A deserter.

16:08.650 --> 16:11.720
I disagreed with the government.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.990
Challenged their authority.

16:18.690 --> 16:21.160
I was arrogant enough to
think I could get away with it.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.680
And arrogant enough to escape.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.050
I had help

16:29.070 --> 16:30.790
- from a guard.
- Ahmos, you're asking him questions

16:30.820 --> 16:32.190
as if the answer mattered.

16:32.230 --> 16:33.860
We should be calling the
government to take him back.

16:34.130 --> 16:36.130
Yes, so we can get our reward.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.800
Has it never occurred
to either of you the trouble

16:38.830 --> 16:40.100
you've caused
by bringing him here?

16:40.130 --> 16:42.810
Nasrin, please.
You're not being helpful.

16:45.970 --> 16:47.870
You didn't tell us your name.

16:53.830 --> 16:54.900
Khalil.

16:55.950 --> 16:57.220
Khalil.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.430
Once he's finished eating,
bring him home.

17:05.980 --> 17:08.480
Give him something to wear
that won't draw attention.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.970
What if the government
finds out

17:10.000 --> 17:11.329
that we are harboring
a fugitive?

17:11.369 --> 17:12.470
They won't.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.640
Because no one in this room

17:14.670 --> 17:16.030
will say anything.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.510
If anyone asks,

17:19.540 --> 17:22.750
tell them Khalil is our cousin.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.750
[woman sobbing]

17:34.750 --> 17:37.750
[bereaved sobbing and crying]

17:54.030 --> 17:56.840
[Jamal] It is no secret that
the Western powers

17:56.880 --> 17:58.480
and their media outlets

17:58.510 --> 18:01.850
have been waging
a crusade against us,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.480
trying to undermine
our government

18:05.500 --> 18:07.170
and divide this country

18:07.190 --> 18:09.390
by supporting Ihab Rashid.

18:09.390 --> 18:12.900
- [Ihab coughs]
- Our government holds

18:12.900 --> 18:15.800
no chemical
or biological weapons

18:15.800 --> 18:19.500
or any other weapons
of mass destruction.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.100
Those weapons were destroyed

18:22.140 --> 18:26.210
25 years ago by President Khaled Al Fayeed,
[door opens]

18:26.210 --> 18:29.840
under the supervision of the United Nations.
[door closes]

18:31.100 --> 18:33.130
Did you get into the mosque?

18:35.380 --> 18:36.440
Mm-hmm.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.150
There are hundreds of them.

18:43.870 --> 18:46.390
Women and children.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
[shivering]

18:48.400 --> 18:51.360
Some of them I recognized.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.760
And...

18:54.110 --> 18:57.450
I think at least
30 of your fighters.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.910
Namir?

19:06.590 --> 19:08.270
Yeah.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.320
- Hey.
- Mm.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.240
I'm sorry.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.200
Ooh.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.200
[pounding on the door]

19:23.810 --> 19:27.580
Zaher. Zaher. Come, come, come,
come, come, come, come. Come.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.880
[door creaks and closes]

19:33.450 --> 19:34.690
You need to leave.

19:34.690 --> 19:36.240
- Both of you.
- No, Zaher, Zaher,

19:36.280 --> 19:37.610
you are in shock.
I understand.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
We are all in shock.
Those of us

19:39.680 --> 19:41.650
unlucky enough
to have survived

19:41.920 --> 19:44.220
because we were working
at the refinery.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.570
But our wives,

19:46.610 --> 19:49.140
our children, they're dead

19:49.170 --> 19:51.450
- because of you.
- No. Jamal Al Fayeed did this.

19:51.470 --> 19:52.970
Because of Ihab.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.420
Because we were foolish
enough to support you.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.300
It's over.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.220
So pack your things

20:01.730 --> 20:02.870
and leave.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.300
May, uh...

20:07.560 --> 20:09.490
may Allah allow your wives

20:10.160 --> 20:11.890
and children into paradise.

20:15.890 --> 20:17.890
[footsteps departing fast]

20:17.890 --> 20:20.890
[door opens]

20:20.890 --> 20:22.890
[door closes]

20:24.220 --> 20:27.230
[Jamal] We are currently
investigating

20:27.230 --> 20:30.600
the source of the
terrorist weapons cache

20:30.630 --> 20:32.600
containing chemical agents.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.670
We will, of course,
make results public

20:35.700 --> 20:37.500
once the inquiry is complete.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.240
Until then, we will continue to
provide emergency medical care

20:42.280 --> 20:45.000
in Ma'an. Finally,

20:45.880 --> 20:48.980
to the victims of
this terrible tragedy

20:49.020 --> 20:50.850
and to their families,

20:50.880 --> 20:55.660
our hearts and prayers are
with you during this dark time

20:55.680 --> 20:56.970
of our nation.

21:01.430 --> 21:03.600
That was excellent, Father.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.730
The ambassador has asked
me to expedite visas

21:05.770 --> 21:08.670
for the guest workers from China
who will be living in Ma'an.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.600
We'll deal with this later.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.810
What did Tariq give you?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.640
Security protocols.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.980
I'm visiting a hospital
tomorrow in Ma'an.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.210
Well, maybe you should
wait a bit with this,

21:22.230 --> 21:23.730
let some time pass.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.390
Now is the time to show the
people we stand with them.

21:27.150 --> 21:28.740
Like you promised
in your speech.

21:30.130 --> 21:31.460
Yes, but...

21:32.350 --> 21:33.640
It was good, by the way.

21:33.670 --> 21:34.780
Your speech.

21:35.510 --> 21:36.530
Sincere.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.390
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.500
You said what
you needed to say.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.380
Come on, Wafiq.
Come on. Check again.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.070
I want the reward money.
Come on.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.260
You're high.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.380
[Kasim] Don't insult me,
man.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.380
It's not an insult. It's a fact.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.370
[Wafiq] You're always high. I get you
in with the army recruiter,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.200
and you get wasted
before your physical.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.860
Okay, just check again,
all right?

22:09.700 --> 22:10.790
I did.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.280
There's no record of an
escaped prisoner named Khalil.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.400
Of course he's not gonna tell us
his real name... he's a fugitive.

22:16.550 --> 22:20.490
Look, there must be a reward for
an escaped prisoner, all right?

22:20.510 --> 22:21.990
Look, we'll split it with you, all right?

22:22.010 --> 22:23.050
Don't you get it?

22:23.070 --> 22:24.540
There's no money to be split.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.560
Our system's not showing
any escaped prisoners.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.110
Whatever game you're playing,

22:29.150 --> 22:31.850
just leave me out of it.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.250
[line signal clicks]
[cell phone beeps]

22:37.890 --> 22:39.660
That guy in our house,

22:41.600 --> 22:43.620
he's not who he says he is.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.230
Khalil?

22:46.260 --> 22:47.460
Hello?

22:50.670 --> 22:52.030
Hello.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.660
Thank you. Um...

22:55.900 --> 22:57.900
you should probably burn those.

22:59.230 --> 23:00.580
I didn't get a chance

23:00.610 --> 23:03.190
to thank your father
for letting me stay.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.910
He seems like a good man.

23:06.290 --> 23:08.200
Ahmos is my husband.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.880
[drawing curtain]

23:12.880 --> 23:14.650
I'm sorry.
I assumed, um...

23:14.670 --> 23:17.840
I shouldn't have assumed.
I'm... I'm sorry.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.890
This is our son, Ghani.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.300
The other woman, Nasrin,

23:22.630 --> 23:24.190
she is his first wife.

23:24.210 --> 23:26.910
I'm his second.
But you're right.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.900
Ahmos is a good man,
a good Bedu.

23:30.430 --> 23:31.250
He said

23:31.270 --> 23:33.750
you should use this
to contact your wife.

23:35.050 --> 23:36.050
Thank you.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.690
Sleep well.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.970
You, too.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.820
Sammy, can you help me
out with some stuff?

23:50.820 --> 23:53.820
[bags rustling]

23:54.440 --> 23:55.580
Sam?

23:55.580 --> 23:57.400
[laughing]

23:57.400 --> 23:59.630
[TV playing]
[Sammy] Yeah.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.630
[dialogue continues from TV]

24:01.630 --> 24:03.630
[Sammy and his friend chuckle]

24:06.630 --> 24:09.630
[both laughing softly]

24:12.000 --> 24:13.880
[Sammy] <i>You know, you weren't
supposed to be home...</i>

24:13.880 --> 24:16.170
- Okay, that's not...
- Well, I...

24:22.060 --> 24:25.760
I wasn't having sex with
him to hurt you, okay?

24:26.710 --> 24:28.130
I... I like him.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.260
Good.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.940
I hope so.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.770
Even if I...
I don't love him, it...

24:37.070 --> 24:39.870
felt better to be with him
than to be alone, you know?

24:39.910 --> 24:41.200
Of course.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.810
And that's natural. I...

24:45.180 --> 24:46.390
I just think...

24:49.280 --> 24:51.170
if we had just talked
about it.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.990
Well, yeah, that...

24:54.420 --> 24:55.610
would have been nice.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.700
But I tried.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.590
Like, three times
on the phone.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.580
"Mom, I met this guy
named Bernard."

25:05.620 --> 25:07.570
But you were always
distracted, and then...

25:08.430 --> 25:11.060
when you came home, you had
enough shit to deal with.

25:12.930 --> 25:14.320
I'm so sorry.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.490
I'm not very good at this,
I know that.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.510
I mean, I... I feel like

25:22.550 --> 25:24.550
I can deal with
the details of life.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.340
I can get things done, but...

25:28.490 --> 25:30.620
the emotional stuff, I'm just

25:30.660 --> 25:32.460
having a hard time
figuring that out.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.770
Yeah. Me, too.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.560
Of course you are.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.240
I went to that class. Um...

25:46.240 --> 25:47.830
the one where
I met Bernard.

25:49.230 --> 25:51.070
And I used
your maiden name

25:51.110 --> 25:52.910
so that no one
would know who I was.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.150
And then one day
the teacher started

25:56.180 --> 25:57.650
talking about Abuddin.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.260
About Dad.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.410
Calling him this great
champion of democracy.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.580
And they all agreed.

26:10.010 --> 26:12.020
All talked like they knew him.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.080
I was the only one
who didn't say anything.

26:18.850 --> 26:21.190
You know, just 'cause
I... I didn't feel that way.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.560
Sammy...

26:22.590 --> 26:24.290
I don't think he liked me.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.110
He loved you.

26:27.950 --> 26:29.410
That's a trick answer.

26:32.370 --> 26:34.170
I don't think I liked him.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.580
He never seemed particularly
interested in me.

26:41.990 --> 26:45.350
I mean, shouldn't your son
matter more than your job

26:45.350 --> 26:46.960
or some insane country

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
- on the other side of the world?
- Okay, you're angry,

26:49.030 --> 26:50.900
- but that's not the same thing...
- Well, he's gone

26:50.930 --> 26:53.340
and the whole world thinks he
left this great legacy, but...

26:54.100 --> 26:56.200
I mean, wh... what did...
what did I get from him?

26:56.260 --> 26:57.680
I'm... I'm his son.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.720
Come here. [sniffles]

27:14.320 --> 27:17.320
[indistinct chatting in distance]

27:23.420 --> 27:25.420
[phone beeps]

27:25.420 --> 27:27.420
[phone thuds]

27:27.420 --> 27:31.420
[inhales and exhales deeply]

27:33.920 --> 27:37.920
[call to prayer over P.A.]

27:42.920 --> 27:44.920
[engine roaring]

27:44.920 --> 27:47.920
[praying continues]

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
[vehicle door closes]

27:53.920 --> 27:56.920
[call to prayer continues]

28:12.720 --> 28:14.590
If you don't tell Father, I will.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.010
He'll kill us for disobeying him.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.510
Unless Khalil... or whoever
he really is... kills us first.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.330
Fine.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.790
After <i>salat.</i>

28:24.830 --> 28:27.030
[all] Allahu Akbar.

28:27.230 --> 28:30.230
[doorbell rings]

28:30.750 --> 28:32.750
[crickets chirping]

28:32.750 --> 28:34.580
You must be Sammy.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.280
- Who are you?
- James. I'm so sorry,

28:37.310 --> 28:39.670
I totally forgot to tell my
kids you were coming over.

28:39.670 --> 28:42.010
Uh, Sammy,
this is James Timmons.

28:42.010 --> 28:44.320
He's an attorney. He's
helping me with Dad's estate.

28:44.350 --> 28:45.350
Come on in.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.860
Your mother
told you that your father

28:50.860 --> 28:52.900
left a more
substantial estate

28:52.900 --> 28:55.950
- than she had suspected?
- Yeah. The Al Fayeed Trust Fund or something?

28:55.980 --> 28:57.100
Yeah, yeah, she...
she told us.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.970
I've been in contact
with the lawyers in Dubai

28:59.990 --> 29:02.550
to get an accounting
of the trust's assets.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.330
- And how much is it?
- Not that we were expecting anything.

29:05.350 --> 29:07.190
I... I always assumed Barry
had been disinherited.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.150
$100 million.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.060
What?

29:11.240 --> 29:12.490
That's how much.

29:12.630 --> 29:13.630
What?

29:13.800 --> 29:15.760
We've inherited $100 million?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.440
Not exactly.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.240
Uh, the terms of the trust

29:20.270 --> 29:23.740
specify that the money
passes along the male line.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.350
Samuel...

29:25.380 --> 29:28.210
Al Fayeed has
inherited $100 million.

29:30.610 --> 29:31.680
[Emma] No...

29:31.910 --> 29:35.010
- He gets all the money?
- [Sammy giggling]

29:35.010 --> 29:37.160
- [Emma] This is 2015, it's the modern world...
- [Sammy] James...

29:37.180 --> 29:38.240
How does he get
all of the money?

29:38.270 --> 29:39.530
Ja... James... [stammering]
I... I have a lot of questions.

29:39.530 --> 29:41.350
- Wait, Mom... Doesn't he have to share it?
- [James] Naturally.

29:41.370 --> 29:42.670
- [Emma] Is this even legal?
- Of course, of course I'm gonna share it. I mean,

29:43.020 --> 29:46.490
uh, Mom, anything you need,
you know, anytime, anywhere, I...

29:46.520 --> 29:47.640
- [Emma] Mom.
- [Sammy] I got you.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.050
Wait, what about me?

29:49.750 --> 29:52.920
You're... smart. I'm sure
 you'll find someone nice,

29:52.950 --> 29:54.380
have a good job, live a...

29:54.400 --> 29:56.180
comfortable life. [laughs]

29:56.200 --> 29:57.910
Um...

29:58.330 --> 29:59.460
This is not funny.

30:00.770 --> 30:03.250
Well, $100 million
says you're wrong. [chuckles]

30:03.250 --> 30:05.250
[Sammy exhales]

30:22.770 --> 30:24.770
Ghani

30:28.970 --> 30:30.640
You look better.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.730
Sometimes a good night's
sleep is the best medicine.

30:36.810 --> 30:39.800
Go ahead with Ghani. I
will walk with Khalil.

30:44.820 --> 30:47.200
It's good you found us.

30:48.730 --> 30:50.800
You can choose
a goat from the herd.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.530
For the feast we are having
tonight in your honor.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.810
Oh... [chuckles]
that's not necessary.

30:57.430 --> 30:58.810
You are our guest.

31:00.370 --> 31:04.270
I asked Daliyah to
convey my gratitude to you

31:04.310 --> 31:07.170
for your hospitality, but
I want to thank you myself.

31:07.210 --> 31:09.090
I admire your courage.

31:09.130 --> 31:12.860
Standing up against a tyrant
who gasses his own people.

31:13.530 --> 31:16.280
The least we can do is
to extend our hospitality.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.620
Gasses his own people?

31:20.340 --> 31:21.790
You don't know.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.650
Of course, how would you?

31:25.310 --> 31:26.990
Yesterday, in Ma'an.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.350
A thousand people dead.

31:30.330 --> 31:33.350
Al Fayeed is denying it,
of course,

31:33.380 --> 31:35.450
blaming Ihab Rashid, but...

31:35.850 --> 31:37.480
everyone knows the truth.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.770
The son doomed

31:42.130 --> 31:43.940
to repeat the sins
of the father.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.100
Whatever you did
to oppose the regime,

31:49.370 --> 31:51.160
I admire your courage.

31:51.570 --> 31:53.570
But...

31:53.600 --> 31:55.970
this is not your fight anymore.

31:57.970 --> 32:00.210
[retching]

32:00.210 --> 32:02.580
[woman] He's not like his
brothers. He likes school.

32:02.610 --> 32:04.510
He wants to study
and be a doctor.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.880
What will he do
if he can't see?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.140
[people coughing]

32:09.140 --> 32:12.220
I've given Dr. Mahfoud
my personal assurance

32:12.250 --> 32:14.260
that he will get whatever
he needs to give your son

32:14.290 --> 32:16.520
and all the victims of
this terrible tragedy

32:16.710 --> 32:18.690
the best available medical care.

32:18.690 --> 32:20.610
[patients coughing continues]

32:20.610 --> 32:22.910
We're also setting a
hotline for the relatives

32:22.910 --> 32:25.130
- to be with their families.
- [Halima] Mrs. Al Fayeed.

32:25.170 --> 32:27.610
- So it will be in different parts of Ma'an.
- [Halima] Mrs. Al Fayeed!

32:27.970 --> 32:29.440
Mrs. Al Fayeed! She knows me.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.640
- Mrs. Al Fayeed.
- It's all right,

32:30.670 --> 32:32.040
it's all right, let her through.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.870
Please. Halima.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.410
[camera shutter clicks]

32:37.410 --> 32:39.340
My little sister.

32:39.950 --> 32:41.730
Her name was Jada.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.790
I'm so sorry.

32:44.820 --> 32:47.720
How can you be sorry and
guilty at the same time?

32:47.720 --> 32:49.720
[camera shutters click]

32:50.400 --> 32:51.870
Tell me, because I'm curious.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.090
Or does repeating
a lie often enough

32:54.130 --> 32:55.240
make it the truth,
even to you?

32:55.270 --> 32:57.280
You're smarter
than that, Halima.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.300
You shouldn't listen
to propaganda,

32:59.630 --> 33:01.340
allowing outsiders
poison your mind.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.120
They're not the ones
poisoning my mind.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.670
I'm sorry for your loss.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.200
I am.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.910
But I'm here to help.

33:10.950 --> 33:14.030
- And if you're not willing to accept that help...
- You're only helping yourself.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.180
I smiled and went along with
your charade, but not anymore.

33:17.490 --> 33:20.590
Not when my sister's blood is on you.
[liquid splashing]

33:20.620 --> 33:22.790
- [Leila gasping]
- I'll get justice for my sister.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.190
Maybe not today or tomorrow,

33:24.220 --> 33:26.080
but sooner than you think.
There are more

33:26.130 --> 33:29.190
of us in Abuddin than you can
ever kill or put in prison!

33:30.190 --> 33:32.190
[door opens]

33:32.190 --> 33:33.470
[door closes]

33:33.470 --> 33:35.470
Dr. Mahfoud, thank you.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.260
Let's go.

33:47.260 --> 33:49.260
[soldier speaks in Arabic]

34:03.460 --> 34:07.460
[pipe organ playing]

34:07.460 --> 34:12.460
[buzzing in background]

34:19.010 --> 34:20.719
Uh, no kids?

34:20.750 --> 34:23.170
Uh, Emma's got
debate practice and... [sighs]

34:23.170 --> 34:25.909
Sammy's at the Ferrari
dealership with Bernard.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.409
That sounds fun.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.719
To be honest, I haven't told
them I've been coming here.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.000
Why not?

34:36.040 --> 34:38.340
Barry and I sort of took
religion off the table

34:38.370 --> 34:39.790
when we raised them.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.190
Which was fine,

34:41.679 --> 34:43.750
till Sammy was born.

34:44.380 --> 34:47.989
I found myself wanting
to baptize him, but...

34:48.489 --> 34:49.920
I couldn't.

34:49.940 --> 34:52.179
Not without betraying
our agreement.

34:52.179 --> 34:54.449
Is that how Barry felt?

34:55.139 --> 34:57.510
I never brought it up.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.570
Probably sounds crazy.

35:00.570 --> 35:02.630
Especially considering
my great-grandmother

35:02.660 --> 35:04.060
- was married in this church.
- [both laugh]

35:04.100 --> 35:05.420
No kidding?

35:05.640 --> 35:07.940
Five generations of
Callaghans in this town.

35:08.910 --> 35:11.720
This conservative, boring town.

35:12.740 --> 35:17.480
No palaces or servants
or calls to prayer.

35:19.980 --> 35:22.480
No coups or chemical
attacks either.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.460
I never got to share
any of this with my kids.

35:30.910 --> 35:32.860
Well, it's not too late.

35:33.310 --> 35:35.090
Yeah, but I... I'm not sure
how that works

35:35.130 --> 35:37.810
after somebody
hands you $100 million.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.600
There's no simple
 answer for that.

35:41.050 --> 35:44.270
Before you got here,
I went to confession.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.050
As if inheriting a shitload...

35:46.070 --> 35:47.600
Sorry.

35:47.630 --> 35:49.650
[sighs] of money is a sin.

35:50.410 --> 35:52.380
Those people
that you worry about...

35:52.900 --> 35:54.380
the gas attack victims...

35:54.410 --> 35:56.300
the money was never
going to them.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.930
It was either Sammy

35:59.080 --> 36:01.080
or your
brother-in-law.

36:01.270 --> 36:03.170
Better that it was Sammy.

36:05.370 --> 36:09.370
[people speak indistinctly in background]

36:21.530 --> 36:22.910
[Ahmos] Kasim.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.560
Give me a knife.

36:30.310 --> 36:31.980
Father.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.230
Please don't be mad at me.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.470
Khalil?

36:42.530 --> 36:44.030
Are you Muslim?

36:45.940 --> 36:46.940
Mm-hmm.

36:48.330 --> 36:50.120
But you don't pray.

36:50.470 --> 36:51.690
I'm, uh...

36:52.870 --> 36:55.390
I'm kind of out of practice.

36:55.420 --> 36:58.550
You can't be a good
Muslim and not pray.

36:58.830 --> 36:59.830
That's true.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.450
If you want, I can teach you.

37:05.350 --> 37:06.950
Ghani,

37:06.980 --> 37:08.530
go bring the milk
to your brothers.

37:08.710 --> 37:09.910
I'm not finished.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.420
Go, <i>habibi.</i>

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
[Ghani sighs deeply]

37:19.820 --> 37:22.820
[wood gate creaks and closes]

37:26.240 --> 37:29.500
My son called someone
he knows in the army

37:29.540 --> 37:33.240
about an escaped prisoner
named Khalil.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.910
You were wearing
prison clothes,

37:38.950 --> 37:41.920
so explain why
there's no records,

37:41.950 --> 37:43.610
why no one's
looking for you.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.830
Because
they think I'm dead.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.090
Ahmos,

37:51.130 --> 37:53.050
I am not a dangerous man.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.440
So you expect me
to trust a liar.

37:59.450 --> 38:02.640
I told you the essence
of who I am,

38:02.670 --> 38:04.880
of why I was in prison.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.410
Still not the same
 as the truth.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.180
It was as close as I could
get and keep us both safe.

38:13.740 --> 38:15.980
So now you're protecting
my family.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.250
If no one here
makes any calls,

38:20.290 --> 38:23.060
then no one on the outside
is gonna come looking for me.

38:25.590 --> 38:27.120
And once I can leave,

38:27.810 --> 38:28.990
I will leave.

38:29.990 --> 38:33.990
[engine revving]
[vehicle approaching]

38:33.990 --> 38:35.990
[engine roaring]

38:37.340 --> 38:39.310
Go inside.

38:40.770 --> 38:42.770
[engine shuts off]

38:42.770 --> 38:46.170
[vehicle door opens]
Hey, Kasim! Kasim!

38:48.710 --> 38:50.610
I am Kasim's father, Ahmos.

38:50.780 --> 38:52.890
Sir, I'm Salam Wafiq.

38:52.890 --> 38:56.170
I worked with Kasim at Souk
Al Tawila, before the army.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.070
How can I help you?

39:00.630 --> 39:02.390
Kasim called last night.

39:02.430 --> 39:05.020
Something about
an escaped prisoner.

39:05.530 --> 39:07.050
An escaped prisoner.

39:09.420 --> 39:10.860
Nothing came up
in our database,

39:11.240 --> 39:12.830
but we were
patrolling nearby.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.270
I thought
we should come by.

39:14.310 --> 39:18.000
In reality, we don't have
the most reliable system.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.550
You say you are Kasim's friend.

39:23.580 --> 39:24.780
Yes, sir.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.750
So you know
 he has problems.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.550
Drugs and things.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.650
Don't worry.

39:30.690 --> 39:31.980
You won't be betraying him.

39:33.460 --> 39:35.730
So, this prisoner
 he mentioned,

39:36.250 --> 39:37.760
uh, Khalil...

39:38.570 --> 39:39.930
He's my cousin.

39:40.230 --> 39:42.040
Visiting from Asima.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.940
I'm sorry my son has
wasted your time.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.940
[engine starts]

40:00.940 --> 40:03.940
[engine revving and roaring]

40:21.140 --> 40:23.940
[scrubbing sound]

40:23.940 --> 40:25.940
[sobbing, sighing]

40:25.940 --> 40:27.940
[sniffles, exhales]

40:29.010 --> 40:31.260
I'm sorry.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.050
That girl, Halima,

40:36.440 --> 40:38.130
[sobbing] you know
what she called me?

40:39.450 --> 40:40.980
It's okay. [sighs]

40:42.050 --> 40:45.550
It was, uh, probably
too early to go there,

40:45.590 --> 40:46.990
to Ma'an,

40:47.020 --> 40:49.180
official stories aside.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.600
[Jamal sniffs]

40:53.600 --> 40:56.000
What does that mean,
"official story"?

40:56.840 --> 41:00.940
It means we can't expect
the people to go along

41:00.940 --> 41:03.700
with what we are telling
the rest of the world.

41:03.870 --> 41:05.870
What we're telling about
the gas attack?

41:06.150 --> 41:08.480
Yes. About the gas attack.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.940
No, you went on television

41:09.980 --> 41:12.010
and told everyone
the gas was theirs.

41:12.850 --> 41:14.650
And you believed me?

41:17.150 --> 41:18.390
Yes.

41:19.980 --> 41:21.650
You never asked me
any questions.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.120
- You never wanted to talk about it.
- No.

41:24.170 --> 41:27.470
- Not one word, you and me...
- No. No!

41:27.490 --> 41:29.090
It's not true, Jamal!

41:32.110 --> 41:34.700
I wanted to believe you.

41:34.740 --> 41:37.450
I wanted us to be different.

41:38.350 --> 41:40.610
[voice breaking] Not like
your father.

41:41.970 --> 41:43.240
[sobbing] This is...

41:43.280 --> 41:45.780
this is not how it was
supposed to be for us.

41:47.730 --> 41:50.050
I wanted to be loved

41:51.530 --> 41:52.780
by my people.

41:52.820 --> 41:55.020
I wanted to be
the mother of a country.

41:55.050 --> 41:56.800
Now look what you have done.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.920
We can never make it right.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.830
- We can never put it back, Jamal.
- Of course we can.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.590
- Listen to me.
- [Leila sniffles]

42:05.710 --> 42:07.230
It will pass.

42:07.230 --> 42:10.080
[sighing]

42:10.080 --> 42:11.750
People forget.

42:12.140 --> 42:15.740
Eventually, all they'll remember

42:15.770 --> 42:18.790
is how much they love
you as their first lady.

42:22.990 --> 42:24.780
We've turned the corner.

42:24.820 --> 42:28.420
15 months of my brother
and the elections

42:28.450 --> 42:31.370
and Ihab and the sheik.

42:34.620 --> 42:38.460
Tariq tells me
the insurgency is broken.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.960
Abuddin is safe.

42:44.050 --> 42:47.600
It's just a small bump
on the road, that's all.

42:51.190 --> 42:55.050
Let's just do something to
take our minds off all of this.

42:55.050 --> 42:59.050
[inhales and exhales]

42:59.250 --> 43:02.250
[low hum of chat]
[pouring liquid]

43:03.420 --> 43:04.490
Thanks for, uh,

43:04.520 --> 43:06.790
letting me use this.

43:08.030 --> 43:10.010
You spoke with your wife?

43:10.110 --> 43:11.830
Actually...

43:11.860 --> 43:14.030
no, I...
I didn't call her.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.520
Thank you.

43:15.540 --> 43:17.380
She should know
you're alive.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.310
I'm an enemy of the State.

43:23.660 --> 43:27.280
Even contacting her
could put her in danger.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.510
She's safer not knowing.

43:31.990 --> 43:33.880
My kids are safer not knowing.

43:35.020 --> 43:37.230
Perhaps you are right
to be careful.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.060
Especially with
this government.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.970
When you are strong enough,

43:45.430 --> 43:48.140
my sons will take you to
Souk Al Tawila,

43:48.140 --> 43:51.030
where we sell our
meat and skins.

43:51.530 --> 43:53.840
It's near the Lebanese border.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.590
My cousin
 will get you across.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.790
You will be safe there.

44:02.230 --> 44:03.070
Thank you.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.280
That's, um...

44:06.390 --> 44:07.680
Thank you.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.980
You don't seem...

44:10.710 --> 44:11.890
convinced.

44:11.920 --> 44:14.910
[scoffs] Sorry.
I'm just, um...

44:15.720 --> 44:18.830
I'm just coming
to terms with the fact

44:18.860 --> 44:21.180
that I don't have
a home anymore.

44:23.180 --> 44:27.180
[call to prayer over P.A.]

44:30.240 --> 44:32.530
If you want...

44:34.190 --> 44:36.380
you'd be very welcome
to stay here

44:36.410 --> 44:38.110
as long as you'd like.

44:38.450 --> 44:42.020
No, I... I can't impose
on your family any more.

44:42.050 --> 44:44.680
Don't feel obligated to stay.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.740
But don't feel obligated
to leave either.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
[footsteps approaching]

44:55.600 --> 44:56.660
Wow, Mom.

44:56.700 --> 44:58.100
This looks amazing.

44:58.140 --> 45:01.030
- [Sammy] Tch. Yeah.
- [Emma] Good.

45:02.040 --> 45:05.680
[utensils clinck] Wait, wait. 
 Hold on. Um...

45:05.680 --> 45:10.140
Do you guys mind if we
say grace before we start?

45:10.140 --> 45:11.540
Grace? Like, uh,

45:11.580 --> 45:13.150
- grace-grace?
- Yeah.

45:13.180 --> 45:14.640
I know we've never...

45:14.640 --> 45:17.350
It's just something my family
did when I was growing up.

45:17.380 --> 45:19.380
Kind of
a tradition. [inhales deeply]

45:19.380 --> 45:21.500
Thought we could use a
few of those around here. [exhales]

45:21.500 --> 45:23.030
But if...

45:23.060 --> 45:24.720
- you're uncomfortable...
- [Emma] No.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.660
Fine.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.840
Yeah.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Okay.

45:37.270 --> 45:41.130
For the blessings
of food and family,

45:41.130 --> 45:44.360
for the little things we
used to take for granted,

45:45.290 --> 45:47.210
and for just being home...

45:47.510 --> 45:51.510
[praying in Arabic]

46:17.510 --> 46:21.510
[prayers respond]

46:21.510 --> 46:26.510
[man praying resumes and others respond]

46:29.510 --> 46:32.510
[Ihab prays in Arabic]

46:48.910 --> 46:50.910
[Nusrat and Leila laughing]

46:50.910 --> 46:54.140
- [Nusrat] Okay.
- Blow. W... Wave, wave, octopus...

46:54.180 --> 46:56.890
- [Leila] Moving.
- [Nusrat] Running. Cyclone!

46:56.890 --> 46:57.970
- [Leila] Blow. Tornado.
- [Nusrat] Hurricane! Hurricane.

46:57.990 --> 46:59.870
- [Leila] You're helpless at this, Jamal.
- [Nusrat] Natural disaster.

46:59.870 --> 47:01.490
- [Ahmed] Hula dancer.
- [Leila] Walking. Walking.

47:01.490 --> 47:03.200
[Jamal] What? Hula dancer.
No, what?!

47:03.200 --> 47:04.730
Pay attention.

47:04.730 --> 47:08.040
- [Jamal blowing out air]
- [Leila] Tornado. Moving forward. Uh, blow, blow.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.440
- [Ahmed] Jellyfish.
- [Leila] Desert?

47:09.440 --> 47:11.410
- What? Jellyfish?
- "Ocean's Eleven"

47:11.410 --> 47:13.410
[laughing]

47:13.410 --> 47:15.940
Come on. Going. Walking.
"Staying Alive."

47:15.980 --> 47:18.910
- Huh? <i>"Gone with the Wind"!</i>
<i>- [Leila] Going? Going. Gone...</i>

47:18.940 --> 47:20.240
- "Gone with the Wind".
- What?

47:20.270 --> 47:21.970
- The book.
- What?

47:21.970 --> 47:27.300
- [Leila] No, that...
- [Leila and Ahmed laugh]
