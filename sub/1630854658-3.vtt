01:38.223 --> 01:41.142
<i>You have now reached</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.686
What'd you do wrong? Answer!

01:43.770 --> 01:45.939
What'd you do wrong?
Answer, you fucking bitch!

01:46.022 --> 01:47.690
Fucking disrespect me again…

01:47.774 --> 01:49.859
<i>What if somebody, anybody,</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:52.320
<i>had tried to come and help me?</i>

01:52.403 --> 01:53.488
God damn woman.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.244
-Where're you going?
-No!

02:00.495 --> 02:03.790
Think anyone's going to help you?
Think you can get away from me?

02:03.873 --> 02:06.126
That's it. You're gonna die now!

02:07.043 --> 02:08.128
Don't hit her!

02:08.711 --> 02:10.880
Please! I'm going to fucking kill you
if you don't stop!

02:10.964 --> 02:13.508
Seon-a, please don't. Don't do it.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.386
Please. Your mom…
Your mom's taking care of it.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.889
-Seon-a, I'm begging you.
-No, Mom, I have to! I have to, Mom!

02:19.973 --> 02:22.725
You'll get arrested if you do it,
but I'll be fine cause I'm a minor.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.062
-So move, please!
-Please don't do this! Don't!

02:27.063 --> 02:29.899
If I have to… I'll do it.
You shouldn't have to!

02:29.983 --> 02:30.942
Seon-a…

02:31.442 --> 02:32.652
Please, stop.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.988
You two bitches
have lost your god damn mind!

02:35.071 --> 02:37.740
Such a good role model, aren't you?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.410
Such a good role model!
The greatest role model!

02:40.994 --> 02:43.746
Fucking whore. I think you need
another beating, don't you?

02:44.831 --> 02:47.876
Are you going to stab me with that, huh?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.336
Huh?! Then stab me.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.547
Stab me! You stupid bitch.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.341
You guys are out of you fucking minds.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.720
All right. Let's do this now then, huh?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.889
You want this, right? Huh?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.432
So, where're you going to stab me?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.163
Yeah, you're right. So don't start now.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.415
Come back every three days.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.793

Got it.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.298
Hey, Ms. Kim.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.927
Can I have a tiny sip
of what you're drinking?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.637
-My coffee, you mean?
-Don't give him any.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.181
Make sure he doesn't
go near the vending machine.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.808
Yeah.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.521

it's better to eat while you're alive?

Thank you so much for helping me.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.467
You're going to be a great doctor.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.303
Am I not seeing you again?

05:04.929 --> 05:06.014
Wait, why?

05:06.514 --> 05:08.766
I need to keep tutoring you.
You haven't beaten me yet.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.938
You're not the person
I'm actually trying to beat.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.986
I have to get going.
I should go tutor now.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.366
Are you tutoring to save up for a house?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.618
Tutoring isn't enough for that.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.371
You're right.
You almost have to inherit one.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.707
But even still,

05:32.790 --> 05:36.085
how can you be
okay with goodbye after all this?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.131
Just let me know, okay?
Whatever direction you're going.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.885
I know.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.387
You're trying to run away.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.890
Even as we stand here,
you're still running away.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.851
But I don't know
the place you're running to.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.355
If I'm being honest, I also want to…

05:57.023 --> 05:57.982
go run somewhere.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.068
But I'm terrible at directions.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.739
Isn't your mother the hospital chief?

06:05.239 --> 06:06.991
Over at Seoul Joo General Hospital?

06:07.575 --> 06:09.869
Haven't you arrived?

06:10.995 --> 06:12.413
Ever since you were born,

06:12.497 --> 06:15.917
the people around you would tell
this is what you're destined to be,

06:16.959 --> 06:18.461
more times than you can count.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.467
Every single morning,
I watch the weather channel.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.220
When they refer to a winter
that's warmer than usual,

06:27.303 --> 06:28.888
they call it a disturbance.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.641
But thick fog is created

06:32.767 --> 06:35.103
if the disturbance follows
a cold wave during the winter.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.565
Since they stay where it's warm,

06:41.609 --> 06:43.736
they don't realize how cold it is outside.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.408
Life is peaceful and wonderful.

Some basic info is written
on the back of the photo.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.448
I've included everything
I've collected so far.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.409
What I want is
any information that's not there.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.954
That includes anything
regarding Chairman Kim Sin-tae.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.289
Sure…

08:21.000 --> 08:22.335
I'll work eight hours a day.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.295
You can also just pay me minimum wage.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.423
Anything other than that
should be paid to me separately.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.217
Fine.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.553
But be aware,
not everything we do will be legal.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.431
And my business will always come first.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.600
Yeah…

08:38.518 --> 08:41.062
This sort of thing will take some time,

08:41.145 --> 08:43.356
but this way,
we won't get any blood on our hands.

08:45.733 --> 08:46.567
Yeah.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.404
Also, do you know how to drive?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.573
I don't.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.243
Then first, learn how to drive.

08:56.160 --> 08:56.994
Right.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.374
Your daughter.
Tell me, what grade is she in?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.878
Ah, my daughter isn't
going to be any trouble at all.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.089
She can handle herself. She's so grown up.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.258
You don't have to worry about her. I'll--

09:10.341 --> 09:12.760
On the weekends,
send her to the Seoul Station

09:12.843 --> 09:13.970
on a two-hour train ride.

09:14.053 --> 09:14.887
I will tutor her.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.183
And you should also pay me
the same wage for tutoring her.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.104
Thank you, ma'am.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.482
I'll bring back some good news for you.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.924
Isn't it illegal a teacher to get paid
for tutoring outside of school?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.259
It is illegal.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.762

11:21.263 --> 11:23.683
This rectangular thing
is called an SD card.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.726
I'll give you several of these things.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.644
It goes in…

11:28.688 --> 11:29.772
with a click.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.065
Then you take a picture.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.111
To get it out, press on this and click.
It'll come out.

11:35.194 --> 11:39.198
Then you can leave it right in here
and I'll just come and get it.

11:39.990 --> 11:40.991
Do you understand?

11:42.284 --> 11:43.744
When should I give you the pictures?

11:46.497 --> 11:47.581
They're all in here.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.084
-Oh!
-Here. Try it.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.005
There's so much I have to learn.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.759
Oh, I feel like
I'm going to break it this thing.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.178
Yeah, if you try
to put it in there like that.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.182
Make sure that the gold part
goes in first.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.359
Got it.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.160
I can't see what…

12:25.911 --> 12:26.912
Oh!

12:30.458 --> 12:32.460
<i>Sometimes I wonder, Yeon-jin.</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:36.046
<i>Which of the two is stronger?</i>

12:37.631 --> 12:39.467
<i>The solidarity between victims?</i>

12:40.843 --> 12:43.929
<i>Or the solidarity</i>
<i>between the perpetrators?</i>

13:56.669 --> 14:00.089
<i>My pictures</i>
<i>don't look that great yet. Sorry.</i>

You couldn't shut up about it before,
so why're you quiet now?

15:07.823 --> 15:10.993
What'd you say about my eyes?
The hell you say, fucker?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.214
What color is this, then?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.967
Tell me what color it is right now!

15:31.972 --> 15:33.557
He's knocked out. You can stop.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.146
You fucking pussy.
I'm colorblind, but I'm not blind!

15:39.229 --> 15:41.023
I know that I knocked him out!

<i>you weren't a very loyal wife, Yeon-jin.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:52.159
<i>However, you try your best to hide it.</i>

15:56.872 --> 15:59.124
I told her it was
too dangerous to play with those.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.209
Oh, it's fine.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.337
Wow, Ye-sol! You've gotten so tall!

16:03.420 --> 16:06.840
Yeah! I'm going to be
a forecaster like you!

16:07.341 --> 16:09.843
This has been Ha Ye-sol
reporting the weather.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.263
Hey, Mommy, are these heels green?

16:15.849 --> 16:18.060
Oh… they're actually red.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.022
Ha Ye-sol, look at Mommy.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.859
The color of these heels
does not matter at all.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.947
What's important is that they cost a lot,
and they're real hard to get.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.742
And what's even more important
is that no matter how rare,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.786
you can own each and every one of them.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.790
The true value of something is
the number written on its price tag.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.041
Not its colors, honey.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.835
Do you understand me?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.714
And I shouldn't tell Daddy, right?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
Oh! Jae-jun, hey!

16:59.810 --> 17:01.478
Here comes the owner of the club.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.649
Wow! Look who we have over here!
It's been too long.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.818
-Hola!
-Hola.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.781
Ah, senorita. As beautiful as always.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.785
If you would've called before,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.704
Ah, sure you would.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.083
When we were in Spain, we were
next door neighbors to Jae-jun here.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.171
Ah, I'd like my friend to meet you.
I want her to be a member.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.214
-Mmm.
-Consider it for me? Please?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.424
Dramatic much?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.011
Do I need to be considered
if we know I can afford it?

17:34.928 --> 17:36.138
Have you enjoyed yourself?

17:36.638 --> 17:39.058
Our country club has the best
golfing greens in the country.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.226
There are some people
who have never been here,

17:41.310 --> 17:42.561
but none only come once.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.730
Exercise anywhere is great.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.607
I did like the dumplings here.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.651
It's really hard to get a spot in here.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.405

-Huh.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.661
Her son is the CEO
of Jaepyeong Construction.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.923
If you give it to me,
I'll personally review it.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.759
Sorry. I've gotta get going.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.178
-I'll call you later.
-Sure, thanks!

18:19.473 --> 18:22.392
Don't accept any applications.
I'm not accepting new members.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.477
Oh, and…

18:28.357 --> 18:29.775
…don't sell dumplings there.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.652
Throw that fucking shit out.

Yes. Got it, sir.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.477
Mr. Choi is waiting for you.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.813
Hmm. Thank you.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.780
For the Jeongbok-dong development,
I've secured the land-use rights for you.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.702
And I've reached
an agreement with the city,

19:21.785 --> 19:24.496
to open the Go square as soon as possible.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.915
I guess changing the company
slowed us down.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.967
You know, most young people

19:37.050 --> 19:39.720
aren't very interested in things like Go.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.805
You don't see that often.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.058
If you look over there, Mr. Park,

19:45.142 --> 19:49.062
the owner of the ribs restaurant
is absolutely fuming

19:49.146 --> 19:51.190
because he's lost two rounds in a row.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.735
They're betting 20,000 won per round.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.236
Really?

20:01.491 --> 20:04.036
How'd you even catch that?
He went down by…

20:15.214 --> 20:17.424
You have to get
the group there first.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.846
You won't find any help over there.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.848
Give up and you'll only lose
by ten territories.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.857
-Hmm.
-Wow, she's good.

20:36.818 --> 20:37.903
God damn.

20:37.986 --> 20:38.987
Got him good here.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.199
Ugh, I can't believe it.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.203
Wow, that's impressive.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.085
Wow, she's very good. incredible.

21:29.079 --> 21:29.913
JAE-JUN

21:29.997 --> 21:32.958
<i>I'm in Seoul right now.</i>
<i>Tomorrow, I'm off and I'm bored.</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:42.592
Oops. Wrong number.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.438
Is he insane?

22:06.658 --> 22:08.493
You smiling because
you thought I was Jae-jun?

22:08.577 --> 22:11.288
Shit… that's fucking funny.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.831
Just open the door now!

22:22.758 --> 22:24.676
You picked
a good one this time.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.512
iPad's in the back.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.312
Are you allowed
to drive Jae-jun's car whenever?

22:35.395 --> 22:37.397
I bet you say it's yours to pick up women.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.941
Without some perks,
this job would be shit.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.235
Six. Nine.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.364
Six. Nine. Six. Nine.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.240
The password.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.329
-What a number, huh?
-Ugh. So gross.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.956
He just got a divorce,

22:55.457 --> 22:57.793
and he owns a ton of property and shit.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.461
He even owns horses in Jeju.

22:59.544 --> 23:03.423
Oh! Oh, my God, I thought he was joking.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.883
Fuck me.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.263
Can you find out a little bit more
about this guy's ex-wife?

23:10.764 --> 23:13.266
What she looks like. Family. Anything.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.727
For 300,000 won, how long would it take?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.437
What's the rush here?

23:17.521 --> 23:20.732
Four hundred fifty thousand won.
I'm a busy man nowadays.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.151
He wants to go to Jeju with me soon.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.112
I have to decide
if I'm sleeping with him or not.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.114
Ah!

23:27.197 --> 23:30.367
Of course you have to.
I'm sorry, all right?

23:30.450 --> 23:33.370
Gotta make sure.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.122
What a slut. Oh God.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.623
Shit.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.208
You're not worth cussing out.

23:38.291 --> 23:42.295
Do you know the one place
where class distinction is crystal clear?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.214
It's in a plane.

23:44.297 --> 23:47.217
First class, business, economy.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.428
While the only thing
dividing them is a curtain,

23:49.511 --> 23:50.679
no one's allowed to cross it.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.180
The hell you saying?

23:52.973 --> 23:55.600
I'm saying people like yourself
will never be allowed to cross it.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.311
You're not getting paid enough
to buy a proper meal.

23:58.812 --> 23:59.813
But I will.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.024
Stop the car.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.026
Well, Jae-jun's car.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.275
Still playing with that?

24:46.234 --> 24:49.946
The match was already over,
but she dragged it out.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.156
Why, though?

24:51.740 --> 24:52.657
Who did?

24:53.241 --> 24:54.201
At the Go house.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.287
What?

24:58.371 --> 25:00.832
I'm going to rest for a bit,
then I'm off to work.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.170
That thing gives me such a headache.
How can you play it?

25:05.253 --> 25:07.005
It ca be a pretty compelling game.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.091
Why do you smoke
even though it's not good for you?

25:10.175 --> 25:11.092
Got it.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.638
Then, why did you marry a woman who smokes

25:14.721 --> 25:16.056
when you yourself don't smoke?

25:16.139 --> 25:18.225
Aside from smoking, you're compelling.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.603
Both for fun, and to look at.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.482
That's what I like about you, sweetie.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.817
You answer every question I ask you.

25:28.902 --> 25:33.156
I wonder, you went on blind dates
with at least three women, including me.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.741
Why was I picked?

25:34.824 --> 25:36.952
You had the least amount of clothing on.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.789
And though you were
wearing the least, it was all Dior.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.084
You're so out of your mind.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.171
For such a nice boy,
you sure can act like a real bad guy.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.092
Hurry up, Do-yeong.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.887
There's very, very little
I'm wearing tonight.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.514
Five minutes.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.944
<i>May I have your attention?</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:12.821
<i>In the interest of safety,</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:15.949
<i>please stand behind the platform</i>
<i>as the train approaches.</i>

26:16.032 --> 26:17.617
<i>The train will now be approaching.</i>

26:49.024 --> 26:49.941
Are you real?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.194
What do you mean?

26:54.738 --> 26:55.655
I dressed up.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.206
<i>We'll start in ten minutes.</i>

27:08.918 --> 27:11.004
Did you pass your exam?

27:12.088 --> 27:14.424
-Yeah.
-Ah. Of course, you did.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.718
Congrats.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.721
Ah, I might be too late.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.765
Thank you.

27:28.813 --> 27:32.150
Semyeong was hosting a conference,
and I went with some professors.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.239
Have you been well?

27:39.115 --> 27:39.949
Kind of.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.370
I heard you went into the military
as a medic.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.164
Yeah, but it's been forever
since I've been discharged.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.333
But how did you know?

27:49.584 --> 27:51.211
From those old guys at the park.

27:52.295 --> 27:54.881
They said the lazy kid went to go serve,

27:54.964 --> 27:56.841
and that he'd come back a new man.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.889
So you kept going to the park, then?

28:05.892 --> 28:08.144
Did you want me
to write you a letter or something?

28:08.228 --> 28:09.813
Are medics even allowed to get letters?

28:11.189 --> 28:14.192
-They usually get a lot of love letters.
-Did you get a lot then?

28:20.365 --> 28:21.491
TO JOO YEO-JEONG

28:21.574 --> 28:23.493
FROM CHEONGSONG PRISON

28:24.202 --> 28:25.203
Not big on letters.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.332
So, what brings you to Semyeong?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.167
Are you working there now?

28:31.918 --> 28:32.752
Not yet, no.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.505
I had some business there.

28:38.091 --> 28:38.925
Is she with you?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.386
She's been staring at you for a while now.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.223
I probably should get going now.

28:49.102 --> 28:49.936
Me too.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.063
And by the way…

28:54.065 --> 28:54.941
back then,

28:55.859 --> 28:58.236
when we were
playing Go together at the park,

28:59.362 --> 29:03.616
I was going through
the coldest season in my whole life.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.954
But when we were playing Go,

29:10.707 --> 29:14.210
that was the only thing
in my life that kept me warm.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.214
So if you think
that I might have a kind heart,

29:19.591 --> 29:21.176
then you're the one to thank.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.222
Just wanted you to know.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.193
That's where I work now.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.904
Just in case you're ready one day.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.825
Have a safe trip.

29:56.586 --> 30:01.174
SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL
PLASTIC SURGEON JOO YEO-JEONG

30:12.185 --> 30:13.269
Excuse me.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.607
EDEN APARTMENTS

30:17.690 --> 30:19.859
Is this your main residence?

30:19.943 --> 30:21.653
You live in 301, right?

30:21.736 --> 30:24.239
You should know I own this building.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.658
I'm aware of that, ma'am.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.244
Do you not live in your apartment?

30:29.327 --> 30:31.996
Your utility bills are
always the lowest here.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.251
-I always pay my rent on time though.
-And I know that, dear.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.296
I was just wondering
what was going on in there.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.340
You were so desperate to live here,

30:42.423 --> 30:45.051
but you've been
leaving it empty for months now.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.721
I haven't been sent to Semyeong just yet.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.306
But I'm trying my best.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.231
<i>I know</i>
<i>we're not supposed to meet in person,</i>

30:58.314 --> 30:59.816
<i>but I have a video to show you.</i>

30:59.899 --> 31:01.317
<i>So I'll meet you in the car.</i>

31:05.530 --> 31:07.365
I thought you were
coming in from the front.

31:07.448 --> 31:10.618
Ah! I'm so sorry. Got it.
I'll remember this next time.

31:12.495 --> 31:15.415
I had to zoom in a ton to get it,
so the quality isn't great.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.958
You'll need to look closely.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.668
-Here.
-Thanks.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.724
There. There. There, you see?
You see? Just look.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.980
Here.

31:43.443 --> 31:47.113
"Hey, sir. Why don't you
sit up front with me today?"

31:50.992 --> 31:52.744
I'm not sure what this is.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.919
"Hey, baby.
Sit up front with me. Come on."

32:07.216 --> 32:09.052
Wait, was the driver's name Jo Su-hyeon?

32:09.135 --> 32:10.637
How did you know?

32:11.220 --> 32:12.972
It was never a woman.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.057
Uh-huh.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.477
There was a box
of erectile dysfunction medication.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.064
I guess gender doesn't matter
as long as you last.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.192
So we should have focused on the age.

32:26.986 --> 32:30.239
Sorry You get so serious
at the weirdest times.

32:35.578 --> 32:36.788
What's wrong?

32:36.871 --> 32:39.874
Did you think I couldn't laugh
because my husband beats me?

32:41.125 --> 32:43.336
I might get hit, but I'm a happy person.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.004
Oh, Jesus.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.553
You should have
told me about that earlier.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.390
-Tell what?
-That you're a happy person.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.393
You see, I don't want to laugh with you.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.353
Why… Why not?

33:03.523 --> 33:06.192
I'm afraid I'll forget
what I'm supposed to be doing

33:06.275 --> 33:07.527
if I let myself laugh.

33:09.737 --> 33:13.032
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.451
I'll be careful.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.997
Maybe this is why I get beaten up.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.456
Don't say that.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.843
Well, I guess I just really love
working with you.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.263
I'm a happy person
who never gets to be happy.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.016
I can breathe now, so I can't stop now.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.565
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll make sure not to bother you.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.900
Well, let's go!

33:51.696 --> 33:53.781
<i>How come she and I…</i>

33:53.865 --> 33:58.411
<i>No, how come we have to</i>
<i>work so hard every day?</i>

33:59.495 --> 34:01.998
<i>Working hard is so tiring.</i>

34:03.207 --> 34:05.293
<i>I'm so sick of working hard, Yeon-jin.</i>

34:05.376 --> 34:06.377
It's ready, miss.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.188
How have you been, Mr. Kim?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.190
I'm Moon Dong-eun.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.068
You're who?

34:30.651 --> 34:31.986
From Seonghan High School.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.531
The Dong-eun who dropped out
back then in 2004.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.949
Don't you remember me?

34:39.702 --> 34:41.704
Who are you?

34:47.168 --> 34:48.795
Oh, hi, Su-han.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.923
It's nice seeing you.
What brings you to this neighborhood?

34:52.507 --> 34:54.550
Dong-eun? What are you doing here?

34:54.634 --> 34:57.095
This is my dad's house. He's my father.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.679
Oh, is that so?

34:59.263 --> 35:02.016
Wow This must be fate, then.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.393
I used to be
a student of your father's, long ago.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.315
Right? Don't you remember me now?

35:10.399 --> 35:14.779
Oh, almost forgot, Mr. Kim.
Now, I'm a teacher like you.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.994
What'd you say about…

35:23.121 --> 35:24.455
my son?!

35:24.539 --> 35:27.166
Say it again? What?!

35:47.353 --> 35:50.523
Why'd you wanna meet here?
Siesta would've been better.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.820
Did you know that even in high school,
this building was abandoned?

35:56.320 --> 35:57.446
And it still is today.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.240
Enough with the small talk.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.578
You're trying to get revenge here,
aren't you?

36:04.162 --> 36:04.996
Yeah. I am.

36:05.079 --> 36:05.997
Wow.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.999
You don't even seem scared of me, huh?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.418
Why aren't you after me, then?

36:12.211 --> 36:14.630
I can't get revenge on you
if you have nothing.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.674
All the others have something to lose.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.885
You have nothing to lose.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.345
Wow, you'd say that to my face?

36:22.096 --> 36:25.725
This is the perfect height
to fall and die. Watch your mouth.

36:27.935 --> 36:28.769
I know.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.731
I stood on that ledge once myself.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.651
-Because of you guys.
-Shit, are you threatening me?

36:38.029 --> 36:41.240
-At least you can get scared.
-You really are asking for it, aren't you?

36:45.828 --> 36:48.247
-Remember Yoon So-hee?
-What?

36:48.331 --> 36:50.499
So many rumors were
going around about her.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.919
About how she killed herself
after she left.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.754
You should remember that at least.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.714
You used to say "Dong-eun's here,"

36:56.797 --> 37:01.052
but you probably said "So-hee's here"
before that.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.102
So-hee fell from this exact place.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.355
But she was pushed.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.868
What the hell? No! No! Not me, huh?

37:25.952 --> 37:27.119
I wasn't the one!

37:27.203 --> 37:28.204
I know.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.166
So go get some money
from the person who actually killed her.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.168
I have info you want.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.092
Well, who was it, then?

37:42.510 --> 37:45.179
I told you. My business
comes first and foremost.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.188
There was so much fucking dog hair,
but I got them.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.400
Ten, with the roots attached, right?

37:57.483 --> 37:58.317
So, hey,

37:59.360 --> 38:03.322
did you… have Jae-jun's kid or something?

38:05.324 --> 38:06.826
You'd have his kid before me.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.954
I'll call when I've confirmed this.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.420
<i>I didn't forget you, Myeong-o.</i>

38:17.962 --> 38:20.381
<i>Of course you also have something to lose</i>.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.465
<i>Just one thing.</i>

38:22.508 --> 38:23.509
<i>Your life.</i>

38:59.962 --> 39:02.798
Do it on her arm, not her hand.
She says it hurts if it's there.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.051
Come on, Sa-ra.
Hurry and wake up to detox.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.427
You need to go to the exhibition.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.388
It's too bright.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.183
Are you an angel?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.185
Enough. Now hurry and get up.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.854
You have a special exhibition today.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.317
If you're gonna smoke, at least
smoke something with a weaker smell.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.987
There are slim cigarettes you, know.
What? Your dealer can't do that?

39:26.530 --> 39:32.411
LEE SA-RA SPECIAL EXHIBITION
GAZING AT AN IDEAL INSIDE A DREAM

39:35.998 --> 39:38.250
Hey. I want that one.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.252
Send it straight to the club.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.797
You know shipping's separate,
dear customer?

39:42.880 --> 39:46.717
-Rich ones are always greediest.
-After taxes, I pretty much pay it back.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.511
My talent's basically used for charity.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.679
Since you only pay income tax,

39:50.763 --> 39:54.058
you don't know there are
other people in a different tax bracket.

39:58.062 --> 39:58.979
Sa-ra?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.482
Hey, hide my drink.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.362
This is Mrs. Jang,
the wife of Buil's chairman.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.280
Oh, hello!

40:08.364 --> 40:10.741
These paintings
are stunning, dear.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.618
I wonder how Ms. Lee was blessed

40:12.701 --> 40:15.746
with such incredible talent
from our wonderful Lord.

40:15.830 --> 40:16.664
Amen.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.833
She bought three pieces already.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.376
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.003
-Please come with me.
-Oh, sure.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.133
Wow.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.511
How the hell can you bare
to put up with that? Tell me, Ms. Lee.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.140
So, I'm getting
a fucking funny award next month.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.768
You should come
and get embarrassed with me.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.103
You should come too, Ms. Lee.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.938
Stop it right now.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.943
So what award are you getting, hmm?

40:46.026 --> 40:47.528
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

40:51.031 --> 40:54.076
Incredible.
This place has hardly changed.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.661
My first time back.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.414
Really? You never saw
the gym teacher again?

40:58.497 --> 41:01.041
Hye-jeong broke up with him.
He was pissed.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.335
-Were you not back in Korea yet?
-Mmm.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.546
Paris, watching <i>Lovers in Paris</i>.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.799
Each episode took four days to download.
Still watched it all though.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.134
Loved it all.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.887
Why isn't this asshole answering?

41:12.970 --> 41:14.346
He has something I need.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.264
Myeong-o?

41:16.265 --> 41:17.850
You can't reach him, also?

41:17.933 --> 41:21.020
Ah, shit I need something from him, too.
No idea where he is?

41:21.103 --> 41:23.272
He probably got drunk
and passed out somewhere.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.358
I should've fired that idiot already.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.681
Wow. It's been far too long, you guys.

41:58.390 --> 42:00.059
How's everyone been?

42:00.976 --> 42:02.728
I swear I've seen her before.

42:03.521 --> 42:08.025
Wow, it's been forever since the six of us
were all together, huh?

42:08.609 --> 42:11.111
Don't you mean the five of us?
Myeong-o's not here.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.988
Ha! Moon So-hui? That's it.

42:13.822 --> 42:16.283
It's not her.
Moon Dong-eun and Yun So-hui.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.954
I heard after she dropped out,
she went to work in a factory.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.289
What're you doing here now?

42:22.373 --> 42:24.542
You're not an alum, like we are.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.628
Sorry, but I feel bad I can't recall
our fond times with you.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.588
Anyway, it's good seeing you, So-hee!

42:29.672 --> 42:31.257
I told you, it's Dong-eun.

42:33.008 --> 42:35.511
I actually come to this gym
every once in a while.

42:36.512 --> 42:40.349
But it seems today I've got
all my friends together again.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.143
How have you been, Yeon-jin?

42:43.644 --> 42:45.479
I love watching your weather reports.

42:46.689 --> 42:50.693
Whenever I watch it,
I think, "You just look so good."

42:55.781 --> 42:56.949
And you?

43:00.035 --> 43:01.620
How have you been doing lately?

43:01.704 --> 43:05.124
I just got a new job,
so I've been pretty busy with that.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.712
Got some new clothes. Ate sashimi, too.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.214
You're chairman
for the Semyeong school district?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.132
WILL - KIM SHIN-TAE

43:13.215 --> 43:14.508
Congratulations.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.973
And who are you?

43:21.056 --> 43:23.142
Did you dig through my trash to find this?

43:23.225 --> 43:24.852
I'm sorry, but there was no other way.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.397
The name of your driver is
Jo Soo-hyeon, right?

43:29.648 --> 43:33.694
Do your son
and future daughter-in-law know

43:33.777 --> 43:37.656
that their inheritance will be divided
and shared with Jo Su-hyeon as well?

43:38.490 --> 43:41.744
Are you trying
to threaten me right now, woman?

43:43.287 --> 43:44.204
I apologize.

43:44.955 --> 43:47.374
What I need is something
you can do quite easily.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.961
All you have to do is bring me on-board
your first grade's class two.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.547
I'm more than qualified for the position.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.883
Currently, I have
an apartment in Semyeong,

43:55.966 --> 43:58.802
and I have already
submitted my resignation to my school.

43:59.887 --> 44:00.888
Transfer school?

44:01.472 --> 44:02.473
Yeah.

44:03.515 --> 44:07.102
May I start at the beginning
of the new school year?

44:25.245 --> 44:28.624
HA YE-SOL

44:31.126 --> 44:33.212
<i>Now, we will begin</i>
<i>the award ceremony.</i>

44:33.295 --> 44:38.342
<i>Our first award goes to Park Yeon-jin,</i>
<i>an alumni from the 23rd graduating class.</i>

44:42.137 --> 44:44.431
2022 PROUD ALUMNI AWARDS CEREMONY

44:49.103 --> 44:52.690
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>every single day will be a nightmare.</i>

44:53.399 --> 44:56.110
<i>Each day will be</i>
<i>disturbing and terrifying.</i>

44:56.610 --> 44:59.988
<i>You won't be able to stop me</i>
<i>or make me disappear.</i>

45:00.823 --> 45:06.578
<i>I plan on becoming</i>
<i>a very old rumor of yours, Yeon-jin.</i>

45:20.134 --> 45:21.885
Let's give it up for Yeon-jin!

45:22.761 --> 45:24.054
Bravo!

45:24.555 --> 45:26.974
You're so incredible, Yeon-jin! Ah!

45:27.057 --> 45:28.308
Whoo!
