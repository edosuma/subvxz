- Ah.

44:26.193 --> 44:28.428
Deceptively simple.

44:28.461 --> 44:30.530
I tested it at Mount Vernon once,

44:30.563 --> 44:33.967
but our soil has an
understratum of hard clay,

44:34.001 --> 44:35.698
impervious to water.

44:36.236 --> 44:38.238
Yeah, water isn't my problem.

guarding our coasts.

50:45.004 --> 50:46.806
- A smuggler turned lawman."
- (no audible dialogue)

50:46.839 --> 50:49.909
(whoops)

50:49.942 --> 50:52.279
This man is no hero! I know for a...

50:52.312 --> 50:53.846
Abe: "And Congressman Tallmadge,

50:53.880 --> 50:57.517
well, you know I never stop
talking about him.

50:57.550 --> 51:01.288
Ben was always the most
well-known patriot of our ring

51:01.321 --> 51:02.955
and a true believer in the cause.

51:02.989 --> 51:05.258
And yet, when Congress sought to reward

51:05.292 --> 51:07.827
the man that would capture John André,

51:07.860 --> 51:10.330
Tallmadge rose to denounce them

51:10.363 --> 51:12.365
as criminals and scoundrels,

51:12.399 --> 51:15.034
claiming that when
they removed André's boots,

51:15.067 --> 51:17.304
it was to search for plunder

51:17.337 --> 51:19.472
and not to detect treason.

51:19.506 --> 51:23.676
Tallmadge broke our vow of
silence this one time only

51:23.710 --> 51:26.150
to defend his enemy in the war.

51:26.713 --> 51:29.653
For if we spies don't stand
for one another,

51:30.550 --> 51:31.951
who will?

51:36.856 --> 51:38.991
Of course, the British
held André as a hero

51:39.025 --> 51:42.329
and quickly forgot
about Benedict Arnold.

51:47.967 --> 51:50.803
None of his future endeavors
came to fruition,

51:50.837 --> 51:53.719
and he died in his bed in 1801.

51:54.641 --> 51:57.477
His wife, long rumored
to be André's lover,

51:57.510 --> 51:59.512
returned to her family in Philadelphia.

52:02.349 --> 52:04.451
She passed in 1804.

52:04.484 --> 52:05.985
And among her personal things,

52:06.018 --> 52:08.488
they discovered a lock of André's hair,

52:08.521 --> 52:12.725
given to her when she
was young and in love."

52:12.759 --> 52:14.727
(bird warbling)

52:16.095 --> 52:19.699
"Love is something easy to conceal...

52:21.501 --> 52:23.207
but hard to kill.

52:27.607 --> 52:29.776
Though I love your mother,

52:29.809 --> 52:32.612
I also never stopped loving
a woman named Anna Strong."

53:06.413 --> 53:09.449
But I never told you everything
I did during the war.

Perhaps, someday, somehow,

you'll get this letter.

But if not...

53:22.662 --> 53:25.269
I'll tell you myself when I see you.

53:26.566 --> 53:29.536
And you can share with me
all you've learned...

53:31.838 --> 53:33.406
from heaven.
