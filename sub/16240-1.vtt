02:16.921 --> 02:18.338
When I was a lad,

02:18.422 --> 02:23.801
a journey down the rivers of England
was a truly blithe experience.

02:23.886 --> 02:29.307
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive," as Wordsworth has it.

02:29.391 --> 02:31.851
Brooklime and flag iris,

02:31.936 --> 02:36.022
plantain and marsh marigolds
rioted on the banks.

02:36.273 --> 02:40.360
And kingfishers
swooped and darted about,

02:40.444 --> 02:43.488
their shadows racing
over the brown trout.

02:44.073 --> 02:45.990
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

02:46.075 --> 02:47.909
I'm happy to be
able to tell you

02:47.993 --> 02:50.119
that these ravishing sights

02:50.204 --> 02:53.206
will be restored to us again
in the near future,

02:53.332 --> 02:57.710
thanks to the diligent efforts of your
government and your local authority.

02:57.795 --> 03:02.465
All the water above this point
will soon be clear.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.968
Clear of industrial effluent.

03:05.135 --> 03:07.220
Clear of detergents.

03:07.304 --> 03:10.181
Clear of the waste products
of our society,

03:10.266 --> 03:13.977
with which for so long we have
poisoned our rivers and canals.

03:18.065 --> 03:21.901
Let us rejoice that pollution
will soon be banished

03:21.986 --> 03:23.319
from the waters
of this river,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.572
and that there will
soon be no foreign...

03:25.656 --> 03:27.156
Look!

03:28.117 --> 03:29.158
What is it?

03:30.869 --> 03:32.078
It's a woman!

03:42.673 --> 03:43.840
What's that
'round her neck?

03:45.968 --> 03:47.343
She's been strangled!

03:47.553 --> 03:49.053
Looks like a tie.

03:49.138 --> 03:51.222
Yes, it's a tie,
all right.

03:51.348 --> 03:52.974
Another necktie murder.

03:54.351 --> 03:55.852
Come on.
Move out of the way.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.521
Please come away
from here, Sir George.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.067
It's another
necktie murder.

04:03.152 --> 04:05.153
What are the police doing about it?
That's what I'd like to know.

04:05.237 --> 04:06.362
Why can't they
find him?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.905
He's a regular
Jack the Ripper.

04:07.990 --> 04:10.658
Not on your life.
He used to carve 'em up.

04:10.743 --> 04:12.785
Sent a bird's kidney
to Scotland Yard once,

04:12.870 --> 04:13.995
wrapped in a bit of
violet writing paper.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.788
That'll do, Herb.
I'm quite sure the lady

04:15.873 --> 04:17.040
doesn't want to hear
any more about it.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.374
Or was it
a bit of a liver?

04:20.418 --> 04:23.421
I say, it's not
my club tie, is it?

04:58.248 --> 05:00.375
Cheers,
Squadron Leader.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.460
Chin chin.

05:02.586 --> 05:03.836
Good morning.

05:04.797 --> 05:07.048
Look, it may come as something
of a surprise to you, Blaney,

05:07.132 --> 05:10.176
but in this pub we sell liquor,
we don't give it away.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.679
Still less do we expect
our employees to steal it.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.097
I was going to pay for it.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.264
Oh, yeah,
I'm sure you were.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.725
Well, that's the last drink you're
gettin' on this house. Go on. Get out.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.143
I told you I was
going to pay for it.

05:19.228 --> 05:21.104
I always pay for my drinks.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.147
Even for your
watered-down gin.

05:23.232 --> 05:25.942
Now, don't come the innocent
with me, you bastard!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.777
My stocks have been
well down this past month.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.028
Now, you watch
what you're saying!

05:29.113 --> 05:30.321
What, to a thief?

05:30.406 --> 05:32.240
What's going on?

05:32.324 --> 05:35.576
Our friend here says that
I've been pinching his booze.

05:35.661 --> 05:37.286
Ridiculous!
He always pays.

05:37.329 --> 05:39.247
- How would you know?
- Well, I work with him, don't I?

05:39.331 --> 05:40.498
And what else?

05:40.624 --> 05:41.833
What's that
supposed to mean?

05:41.917 --> 05:44.377
Look, just keep out of this, will you,
Babs? Come on, Blaney, outside.

05:44.461 --> 05:45.586
- You're fired.
- You can't do that.

05:45.671 --> 05:47.088
He never stole
nothing in his life.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.631
He puts the money in the till.
I've seen him.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.883
A thief or a boozer,
it's all the same to me.

05:50.968 --> 05:53.052
I don't need
either one as a barman,

05:53.137 --> 05:54.512
quite apart from
the fact that half the time

05:54.596 --> 05:56.264
he's pulling your tits
instead of pulling pints.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.015
- Now, look here...
- He can't keep his hands off you.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.517
The customers are
always talking about it.

05:59.601 --> 06:01.894
And what about you?
Always fingering me.

06:01.979 --> 06:04.689
You keep your lying mouth shut,
Babs, or you can get out as well.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.065
I'm off.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.526
Keep the change!

06:14.408 --> 06:15.992
I'll send for
my things later.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.244
Just a minute!

06:18.328 --> 06:21.539
There's a little matter of £10
I advanced you on your salary.

06:21.623 --> 06:23.833
Are you planning to
steal that as well?

06:27.796 --> 06:30.506
There you are. You know
what to do with them.

06:36.847 --> 06:38.931
You shouldn't let him
talk to you like that.

06:39.016 --> 06:40.016
I know.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.601
What are you
gonna do, love?

06:42.227 --> 06:43.561
I don't know.

06:43.645 --> 06:44.896
Another pub perhaps.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.397
Are you all right?

06:46.482 --> 06:48.858
You just gave him back
the 10 quid you borrowed.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.612
I had to.
He didn't think I had it.

06:52.696 --> 06:53.780
Don't worry,
I've got a bit left.

06:53.864 --> 06:55.782
Well, this is Covent Garden,
not the garden of love.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.700
How 'bout starting work?

06:58.035 --> 06:59.535
Oh, get stuffed.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.415
Look after yourself.

07:04.541 --> 07:05.708
I'll call you.

07:16.053 --> 07:17.804
Thanks, guv.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.641
- Hello, Dick.
- Hello, Bob.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.810
I was just coming over
for a quick one.

08:05.894 --> 08:08.688
Why aren't you back there polishing
the sausages or watering the gin,

08:08.772 --> 08:11.732
or whatever it is you do
there before opening time?

08:11.817 --> 08:14.277
I have just been
given the push.

08:15.279 --> 08:16.571
What for?

08:16.655 --> 08:18.990
You weren't pissing
in the beer again?

08:19.074 --> 08:20.783
Forsythe and I had
a set-to.

08:20.909 --> 08:22.618
Oh, him.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.996
You duffed him up, I hope.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.789
He's a bastard.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.543
He was on my back
right from the start.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.712
From squadron leader to barman
in one easy lesson!

08:32.796 --> 08:33.796
He wouldn't leave it alone.

08:34.506 --> 08:35.923
He's the boss'
brother-in-law, isn't he?

08:36.008 --> 08:37.924
- Forsythe?
- Yeah, I think so.

08:38.302 --> 08:40.553
Brother-in-laws
are the worst.

08:40.636 --> 08:42.763
Or should I say,
"Brothers-in-law"?

08:45.267 --> 08:46.267
What are you gonna do now?

08:47.811 --> 08:48.978
I haven't decided yet.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.606
Well, if you're in schtuk,
you know where to come.

08:52.524 --> 08:53.566
Thanks.

08:54.109 --> 08:55.234
George!

08:56.028 --> 08:57.320
That's the last one.

08:57.487 --> 08:58.821
Thanks, Mr. Rusk.

09:02.492 --> 09:04.035
Why don't you go and have
a chat with your ex?

09:04.119 --> 09:06.037
She's doin' all right,
isn't she?

09:06.121 --> 09:07.914
I haven't seen her
for ages, as you know.

09:07.998 --> 09:09.749
There's no use
opening all that up again.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.709
No, I suppose not.

09:11.793 --> 09:14.837
Well, as I say,
you can always rely on me.

09:16.673 --> 09:17.882
You're all right
for a few quid?

09:18.008 --> 09:19.216
Yes. Thanks all the same.

09:19.301 --> 09:20.384
'Cause if you're not...

09:20.469 --> 09:22.178
No, no. Really.
I just got paid.

09:22.888 --> 09:24.722
Well...

09:24.806 --> 09:25.890
Have some grapes.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.516
Here you are.
I'll get you a box.

09:32.189 --> 09:34.982
Finest muscats,
fresh in this morning.

09:35.067 --> 09:38.194
Here you are. Take one of these
back to your girlfriend, Babs.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.948
Get her to peel you one.
"Beulah, peel me a grape."

09:42.032 --> 09:44.450
That's what my ol' mum used
to say when I was a kid.

09:44.534 --> 09:45.826
Well, at least you
won't starve to death.

09:49.247 --> 09:51.958
Are you sure you don't
need a few bob?

09:52.042 --> 09:53.459
No, I'm okay.

09:53.543 --> 09:56.087
Well, you don't look okay.
Anything else the matter?

09:58.048 --> 10:00.132
No. What should be?

10:00.217 --> 10:01.634
I don't know.

10:02.552 --> 10:05.137
Well, remember, anything I can
do, anytime, it's a pleasure.

10:05.222 --> 10:06.222
Ta.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.724
It won't be the same
in the Old Globe now.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.934
Well, Babs
is still there.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.185
Yeah, that's true.

10:11.269 --> 10:12.436
And she's
prettier than you.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.272
A matter of opinion.
Bye, now.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.775
Hey, wait a minute.
Here, give us your paper.

10:17.859 --> 10:20.111
Here you are. This will
make you a fortune.

10:20.195 --> 10:23.197
This afternoon in the 3:00,
Coming Up.

10:23.281 --> 10:25.825
Never been out before, but
very well-fancied at home.

10:26.076 --> 10:27.576
Now, this is
a four-horse race,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.161
and the other three
have all won before.

10:29.246 --> 10:31.497
So she'll start about
20-to-1, maybe more.

10:31.581 --> 10:32.707
20-to-1?

10:32.791 --> 10:34.250
Put your word on it.
She can't lose.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.128
A little birdie told me, and my
little birdies are reliable.

10:37.212 --> 10:38.170
Well, thanks again, Bob.

10:38.255 --> 10:39.255
Anytime.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.673
Don't forget,
Bob's your uncle.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.675
Good morning, Mr. Rusk.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.885
Hello, Sergeant.
What's new?

10:44.970 --> 10:46.012
Not much.

10:46.096 --> 10:48.472
This necktie fellow's giving them
a bit of a headache, though.

10:48.557 --> 10:50.516
Can't seem to get
a line on him.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.976
Have you tried
advertising?

10:52.060 --> 10:53.769
Oh, very funny.

10:54.229 --> 10:55.604
Look, you're one
for the birds.

10:55.731 --> 10:57.231
Ask 'em all if they've
ever had a near miss

10:57.315 --> 10:58.816
with a bloke like that,
would you?

10:58.984 --> 11:00.401
Or if any of their
girlfriends have.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.485
Sure.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.321
Mind you, half of them haven't got
their heads screwed on right,

11:04.406 --> 11:06.741
let alone knowing when
they've been screwed off.

11:06.825 --> 11:08.534
Have you met
my friend Dick B...

11:12.581 --> 11:14.623
Funny fella.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.417
Well, don't worry, Sergeant.
I'll put the word about.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.002
Thanks, Mr. Rusk.

11:31.475 --> 11:33.142
A large brandy.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.061
What're you
gonna have, Doctor?

11:35.145 --> 11:37.063
A pint and a morsel of
cheese'll do me fine.

11:37.147 --> 11:39.356
Let me order us a hot lunch.
We have plenty of time.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.691
Hello, Mr. Usher.

11:40.776 --> 11:42.109
What's good
today, Maisie?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.611
Stick to the shepherd's.
I would.

11:44.654 --> 11:47.073
Right. That's two shepherd's
pies, then, please.

11:47.157 --> 11:48.908
And two pints.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.745
I see our necktie murderer's
been up to it again.

11:52.829 --> 11:55.456
I saw the newspaper headlines
as we came away from the court.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.540
Hmm.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.753
I wouldn't envy the lot of any medical
man giving evidence at that trial.

12:00.837 --> 12:02.379
Why not?

12:02.464 --> 12:04.882
Why, surely
it's easier in these days

12:05.008 --> 12:07.468
of legally diminished
responsibility.

12:08.011 --> 12:10.221
In many cases
you may be right.

12:10.305 --> 12:12.139
But not here.

12:12.224 --> 12:13.724
The man who's
killing these women

12:13.809 --> 12:15.976
is a criminal,
sexual psychopath.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.188
And the legal profession has never
really known how to treat them.

12:19.815 --> 12:23.484
I suppose you could
call them social misfits.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.821
We were just talking about
the tie murderer, Maisie.

12:26.905 --> 12:28.239
You better watch out.

12:28.323 --> 12:30.241
He rapes 'em first,
doesn't he?

12:31.660 --> 12:33.244
Yes, I believe he does.

12:33.328 --> 12:34.787
Well, I suppose
it's nice to know

12:34.871 --> 12:36.372
that every cloud
has a silver lining.

12:36.873 --> 12:37.873
Oh.

12:39.668 --> 12:42.503
On the surface,
in casual conversation,

12:42.587 --> 12:46.715
they appear as ordinary,
likable adult fellows.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.303
But emotionally they remain
as dangerous children,

12:51.388 --> 12:55.975
whose conduct may revert to a primitive,
subhuman level at any moment.

12:56.059 --> 12:57.017
Large brandy.

12:57.102 --> 12:59.019
You mean they'll
kill at any time,

12:59.104 --> 13:00.187
just as the mood
takes them?

13:00.272 --> 13:01.689
Exactly.

13:01.773 --> 13:04.150
And, being governed
by the pleasure principle,

13:04.234 --> 13:05.693
they're particularly
dangerous

13:05.777 --> 13:07.570
when their desires
are being frustrated.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.991
Are you deaf? I distinctly
said a large brandy.

13:12.075 --> 13:13.868
There's scarcely enough
in that to cover the bottom.

13:13.952 --> 13:16.412
Actually, you can
make it a triple.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.914
I wonder if the police have got
any sort of line on this fellow.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.167
Oh, I shouldn't think so.

13:21.251 --> 13:24.378
With psychopaths there's
usually no linking motive.

13:24.462 --> 13:26.130
Let's hope
he slips up soon.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.716
In one way,
I rather hope he doesn't.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.969
Well, we haven't had
a good, juicy series

13:32.053 --> 13:33.762
of sex murders
since Christie.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.765
And they're so good
for the tourist trade.

13:36.850 --> 13:40.060
Foreigners somehow expect the squares
of London to be fog-wreathed,

13:40.145 --> 13:44.106
full of hansom cabs and littered
with ripped whores, don't you think?

13:48.403 --> 13:50.070
Hey, Dick!

13:51.406 --> 13:52.531
What about
Coming Up then?

13:53.283 --> 13:55.701
No, I'm afraid I haven't any time.
Thanks all the same.

13:55.785 --> 13:58.662
No, Coming Up, the horse.
It won by a mile.

13:59.122 --> 14:01.498
20-to-1!
What did I tell you?

14:04.461 --> 14:06.295
Made a fortune.
Thanks a lot.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.713
Anytime.

14:07.797 --> 14:09.131
Hey, wait a minute!

14:11.176 --> 14:14.553
This is my ma.
Ma, meet Dick Blaney,

14:14.638 --> 14:16.805
the best pilot who ever
pulled a pint of beer.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.224
Hello, Mrs. Rusk.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.309
Pleased to meet you,
I'm sure.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.812
She lives down in Kent,
in the Garden of England!

14:25.190 --> 14:26.398
Still got the grapes then?

14:26.483 --> 14:28.150
Oh, yeah. Keep 'em for later.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.487
You tell her to take the pips out.
They're bad for the appendix.

14:31.780 --> 14:32.738
Ta-ta.

14:32.822 --> 14:33.989
Bye. Thanks again for the tip.

14:34.282 --> 14:36.325
I told you,
Bob's your uncle.

14:38.828 --> 14:40.913
20-to-1!

14:40.997 --> 14:45.125
20-to-bloody-1!
Christ! Damn it to hell!

15:16.199 --> 15:17.157
Well, my dears,

15:17.242 --> 15:20.286
I'm sure I can say on behalf of
Mrs. Blaney as well as myself,

15:20.370 --> 15:21.829
that it's moments
like this that make

15:21.913 --> 15:23.747
all our little efforts
here so worthwhile.

15:23.832 --> 15:25.791
You mean, you just don't
do it for the money?

15:27.544 --> 15:29.545
Of course, Mrs. Davisson,
this is a business,

15:29.629 --> 15:31.714
and financial
considerations prevail.

15:32.716 --> 15:36.552
But our ultimate satisfaction is the
making happy of two lonely people.

15:36.928 --> 15:39.888
Nice of you, Miss Barling.
Keep up the good work!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.975
Well, it's up to us now,
I guess, eh?

15:43.059 --> 15:45.019
Yeah. And good-bye,
Mr. Salt.

15:45.687 --> 15:47.563
Bye, Miss Barling.
Thank you.

15:47.856 --> 15:51.150
It's been our pleasure. And I
know you'll both be very happy.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.069
After all, I know you're
both mad about beekeeping.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.612
And there's nothing
like a shared interest.

15:55.739 --> 16:00.534
I'm sure we will be. Come on, Neville.
Best foot forward.

16:00.618 --> 16:02.202
I suppose
we should go straight

16:02.287 --> 16:03.871
and get the marriage
license, my dear.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.998
What's your rush?

16:06.499 --> 16:09.043
Let's go to my place first.

16:09.127 --> 16:11.837
Did you know, Neville, that my
late husband, Mr. Davisson,

16:11.921 --> 16:14.923
was up at 5:30 every
morning of his life?

16:15.008 --> 16:17.176
And by the time he brought
me my cup of tea,

16:17.260 --> 16:19.345
which he did
punctually at 9: 15,

16:19.429 --> 16:22.765
he would've cleaned the whole house,
and he was so quiet about it,

16:23.058 --> 16:25.434
that in 14 years,
he never woke me once.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.353
Not once!

16:27.437 --> 16:29.855
Oh, a neat man,
was he, then?

16:29.939 --> 16:31.857
He liked a tidy place.

16:31.941 --> 16:33.650
So do I,
come to that.

16:34.611 --> 16:36.779
Dandruff. We'll have to get
you something for that.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.163
Afternoon.

16:47.957 --> 16:49.958
You're new here,
aren't you?

16:51.419 --> 16:55.047
I've been here for over a year now.
What can I do for you, sir?

16:55.131 --> 16:56.340
You can inform Mrs. Blaney

16:56.424 --> 16:58.634
that one of her less
successful exercises

16:58.718 --> 17:00.177
in matrimony has
come to see her.

17:00.261 --> 17:02.054
And who shall
I say is calling?

17:02.138 --> 17:03.430
Mr. Blaney.

17:03.681 --> 17:06.141
Or if you preferred it,
ex-Squadron Leader Blaney,

17:06.226 --> 17:09.103
late of the RAF and
Mrs. Blaney's matrimonial bed.

17:09.186 --> 17:12.897
I see. Is Mrs. Blaney
expecting you?

17:12.982 --> 17:14.191
She must be.

17:14.275 --> 17:17.736
Everybody expects a bad penny
to turn up sooner or later.

17:19.656 --> 17:23.409
Mrs. Blaney, there's a
Mr. Blaney to see you.

17:23.492 --> 17:27.329
<i>Mr. Blaney? Send
him in, will you please, Monica?</i>

17:33.002 --> 17:34.002
Hello, Brenda.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.587
Hello, Richard.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.507
What are you doing here?

17:39.134 --> 17:41.135
I just thought
I'd call around.

17:42.387 --> 17:44.304
Well, come in.
Take a seat.

17:44.389 --> 17:45.431
Thanks.

17:48.309 --> 17:49.351
It's good to see you.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.813
You too. You look fine.

17:54.023 --> 17:56.817
I'll be with you in a minute. I've got
to finish writing up a few notes.

18:00.530 --> 18:02.030
How is everything
then, Brenda?

18:02.407 --> 18:03.532
You making a fortune?

18:03.616 --> 18:04.867
Things are going very well.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.412
Streets of London
thronged with lonely hearts

18:08.496 --> 18:09.746
beating a path
to your door?

18:09.831 --> 18:10.998
That's it.

18:12.667 --> 18:13.792
I'm amazed that in an age

18:13.877 --> 18:16.712
where practically everybody
considers marriage is hell

18:16.796 --> 18:18.297
that you can find
any clients.

18:18.381 --> 18:20.466
Okay, Richard, if you've just
come around here to insult me,

18:20.550 --> 18:21.550
I think, perhaps you...

18:21.634 --> 18:22.968
I'm not insulting you,
for Christ's sake!

18:23.052 --> 18:24.803
Will you please
lower your voice.

18:24.888 --> 18:25.971
Why?

18:26.055 --> 18:29.141
I don't care if Vinegar Joe
out there does hear me.

18:29.225 --> 18:31.310
Why don't you get her
married off, by the way?

18:31.394 --> 18:34.313
Preferably to a 700-pound
Japanese wrestler.

18:34.397 --> 18:36.982
That should iron out some
of her creases a little.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.903
Monica, dear,
it's nearly 4:30.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.446
Why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon off?

18:42.530 --> 18:44.823
I'm sure there's some
shopping you'd like to do.

18:44.908 --> 18:46.825
Well, thank you, Mrs. Blaney,

18:46.910 --> 18:48.410
if you're sure
you don't need me.

18:48.745 --> 18:50.996
I'm quite sure, thank you.
Good night.

18:56.044 --> 18:57.628
Why do you
always come to see me

18:57.712 --> 18:59.254
when you've had
too much to drink?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.965
I don't always come to see
you when I've had too much to drink.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.842
As a matter of fact, I don't
always come to see you.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.802
I haven't seen you
for over a year.

19:05.887 --> 19:09.056
You were half seas
over then, and violent.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.933
I do hope we're not going
to have a repeat of that.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.184
Me violent?

19:12.268 --> 19:13.810
Don't be bloody ridiculous.

19:13.895 --> 19:16.188
Would I raise a hand
to the goddess of love?

19:16.272 --> 19:20.234
What Brenda Blaney brings
together let no man put asunder!

19:21.444 --> 19:24.279
I didn't say
you were violent to me.

19:25.114 --> 19:27.199
But you certainly
acted the fool

19:27.283 --> 19:29.409
and threw the furniture
about a bit.

19:36.834 --> 19:39.670
Just look at
the state you're in.

19:39.754 --> 19:40.837
Really!

19:40.922 --> 19:42.214
Oh, leave me alone.

19:42.298 --> 19:44.174
Bachelors are supposed
to be untidy, aren't they?

19:44.259 --> 19:48.887
I thought tidiness was most women's
dowry, or don't you preach that here?

19:48.972 --> 19:51.557
Oh, we are bitter today.

19:52.475 --> 19:53.892
What's the matter?

19:53.977 --> 19:55.269
I'm sorry.

19:56.145 --> 19:59.356
I had a bad day, that's all.
I lost my job.

20:00.483 --> 20:01.483
How?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.527
Well, I got fired, that's how.

20:03.611 --> 20:04.945
What do you think,
I mislaid it?

20:06.155 --> 20:07.990
For pinching
a glass of brandy.

20:09.325 --> 20:11.743
My employer thought I wasn't going
to put the money in the till.

20:12.161 --> 20:13.161
Till?

20:14.414 --> 20:17.207
I was working, until this
morning that is, as a barman.

20:18.501 --> 20:20.794
And another thing. I was
given a very good horse

20:20.878 --> 20:23.880
by a great friend of mine,
one Bob Rusk.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.215
And it came in at 20-to-1,

20:25.300 --> 20:27.301
and I didn't have enough
cash on me to back it.

20:29.012 --> 20:30.512
I'm sorry.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.309
Well, these things
always go in threes.

20:35.393 --> 20:37.561
I wonder what the rest
of the day has in store.

20:38.688 --> 20:39.896
Dinner with me, I hope.

20:44.319 --> 20:46.778
Well, that, of course,
would be delightful, but...

20:46.863 --> 20:48.071
I mean, of course, on me.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.365
We'll go to my club.

20:51.659 --> 20:54.286
But I must finish
these letters first.

20:54.370 --> 20:57.414
Here's the address,
in case you've forgotten it.

20:57.498 --> 21:01.460
How will it be if we meet
there 'round about 7:30?

21:01.544 --> 21:02.711
Fine.

21:04.047 --> 21:07.466
Thanks for a lovely evening.
It was great. I mean that.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.635
Thanks for joining me.

21:09.719 --> 21:12.763
It was a damn sight better than
the leftovers at the Globe,

21:12.847 --> 21:14.931
not that I'm in for any
more of those, of course.

21:15.016 --> 21:16.600
You ought to get
married again, Richard.

21:17.018 --> 21:18.226
Oh, no.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.438
You ought to know I'm no good at it.
How long did we have?

21:22.023 --> 21:24.149
Nine years, was it?

21:24.233 --> 21:25.484
- Ten.
- Ah.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.611
Ten years.

21:27.695 --> 21:29.196
It was a good job
you got out when you did.

21:29.405 --> 21:31.615
I don't know.

21:31.699 --> 21:34.076
I suppose I was lucky the
agency worked out for me.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.285
What you mean is,
that you're lucky

21:35.370 --> 21:37.329
you haven't had to rely on me
these past two years.

21:37.413 --> 21:38.372
I didn't say that.

21:38.456 --> 21:39.581
But you meant it.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.917
Look, Richard,
I suppose some people

21:42.001 --> 21:44.044
are good at organization
and others aren't.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.837
That's all I meant.

21:45.922 --> 21:47.339
And I'm not, I suppose.

21:47.423 --> 21:50.676
Rubbish! You know
what filthy luck I had.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.552
Was it my fault that
the roadhouse didn't go?

21:52.637 --> 21:53.637
It was going fine

21:53.721 --> 21:55.389
- till they opened the bloody motorway.
- I know.

21:55.473 --> 21:57.641
Was it my fault the council
tore down the riding stables?

21:57.725 --> 22:00.185
I know. I know life
can be very unfair.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.938
But you never used to
be sorry for yourself.

22:03.606 --> 22:06.191
Where's the Richard Blaney
I married?

22:06.275 --> 22:09.403
Richard Blaney, EFC. Do you
remember the citation?

22:10.238 --> 22:15.242
"For inspiring leadership,
skill, and tenacity of purpose."

22:15.326 --> 22:17.494
You divorced him.
That's what happened to him.

22:17.578 --> 22:18.620
Now, you tell me,
what sort of skill

22:18.705 --> 22:21.373
do you need to deal with shopkeepers
and interfering bureaucrats?

22:21.457 --> 22:23.125
Everyone's listening.

22:23.459 --> 22:24.710
Well, let them.

22:24.794 --> 22:26.169
I'll bet they've
never had to tear down

22:26.254 --> 22:27.796
their own livelihood
with their own hands.

22:28.506 --> 22:29.715
It's all right for you.

22:29.799 --> 22:31.717
You just go and build
it up somewhere else.

22:31.801 --> 22:33.927
You're like that.
You're good at business.

22:34.011 --> 22:36.430
I'll bet they're all
good at business here.

22:36.514 --> 22:38.890
I'll bet you're making a
fortune out of that agency.

22:38.975 --> 22:41.810
And why not? If you
can't make love, sell it.

22:42.437 --> 22:44.855
The respectable kind, of course.
The married kind!

22:46.816 --> 22:48.108
Now look what you've done.

22:48.192 --> 22:50.193
Oh, sir.
Let me help you.

22:50.278 --> 22:51.903
Leave me alone!

22:58.244 --> 23:01.705
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.459
Come on. We'd better go.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.794
Will you be all right?

23:08.337 --> 23:11.465
You did say you hadn't enough
money to put on that horse.

23:11.549 --> 23:14.593
Don't worry. You've done
enough for one day.

23:31.194 --> 23:32.611
You had a coat too,
didn't you?

23:32.695 --> 23:34.362
Yeah. That one there.

23:34.739 --> 23:36.531
Mine's the pink one.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.285
No, no, no.
That's not allowed.

23:40.369 --> 23:42.329
Rules of the club.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.293
Thank you.

24:00.848 --> 24:04.226
It's all right, Richard. I've got it.
Here. Thank you.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.645
So, this is it, huh?

24:07.563 --> 24:09.439
Can I come in?

24:09.524 --> 24:11.691
I'd like to see
where you live.

24:11.776 --> 24:15.028
Go along now. Run along home.
It's late.

24:15.112 --> 24:16.488
You call this late?

24:16.572 --> 24:18.406
It's late enough
for a working girl.

24:18.908 --> 24:22.828
Come on, Brenda. I won't
be long, I promise.

24:22.912 --> 24:27.040
All right, but only
for a few minutes, mind.

24:27.124 --> 24:29.084
Okay, thanks.
I won't need you.

25:02.493 --> 25:05.203
It just fell out of your pocket,
guvnor, onto the floor.

25:05.288 --> 25:08.874
And I was just putting it
back when you were asleep.

25:08.958 --> 25:12.168
It sort of jerked out,
like, on the floor.

25:12.253 --> 25:15.255
I was putting 'em in a bit quiet,
like, so as not to waken you.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.216
You keep your hands out of my
pockets, or I'll break your arms!

25:18.301 --> 25:20.927
Honestly, there's
nothing I detest

25:21.012 --> 25:23.263
more than someone
taking liberties

25:23.347 --> 25:25.807
with a fine gentleman
like yourself.

25:38.821 --> 25:40.697
Oh, it's you again,
Mr. Robinson.

25:40.823 --> 25:43.408
Yes, I'm afraid so.

25:43.951 --> 25:46.244
Well, I'm having
my lunch just now.

25:46.329 --> 25:47.287
If you want
an appointment,

25:47.371 --> 25:49.080
perhaps you'll be good
enough to see my secretary.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.250
By the way,
how did you get in?

25:52.335 --> 25:54.210
Oh, no problem, really.

25:54.962 --> 25:56.755
Just a question
of using your head.

25:58.883 --> 26:02.427
I waited in the courtyard till
I saw her go out to lunch.

26:03.512 --> 26:04.930
It all seems
a bit elaborate.

26:05.014 --> 26:07.349
Yeah, perhaps, but...

26:09.810 --> 26:12.020
You're the one
I wanted to see.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.608
I thought I'd already explained
to you that we cannot help you.

26:16.692 --> 26:19.110
Oh, come on now.

26:19.195 --> 26:22.822
I know that you can be
most helpful when you try.

26:22.907 --> 26:26.076
Look, Mr. Robinson, you want
women of a specific type.

26:27.370 --> 26:28.536
How shall I put it?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.039
Certain peculiarities
appeal to you,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.708
and you need women
to submit to them.

26:34.543 --> 26:37.545
Here we have, I'm afraid,
a very normal clientele.

26:38.005 --> 26:39.673
As I say,
we can do nothing for you.

26:40.257 --> 26:42.092
And now if you'll kindly let
me get on with my lunch.

26:42.176 --> 26:45.011
I don't think you're really
trying your best for me.

26:46.389 --> 26:50.225
I mean, if you can fix up a lot
of idiots, then why not me? Hmm?

26:51.686 --> 26:54.020
I've explained.
You're different.

26:54.397 --> 26:55.522
How so?

26:56.565 --> 26:57.899
I have my good points.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.403
I like flowers and...

27:03.364 --> 27:04.990
Fruit.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.742
People like me.

27:09.078 --> 27:10.578
I've got things to give.

27:10.871 --> 27:12.497
I'm sorry.

27:13.374 --> 27:16.751
I thought matrimonial agencies were
supposed to bring people together?

27:17.420 --> 27:18.753
Not people like you.

27:20.089 --> 27:22.090
Somehow I don't think
our clients would appreciate

27:22.174 --> 27:24.134
your conception of
a loving relationship.

27:24.218 --> 27:26.219
I get on with
all sorts of people.

27:26.595 --> 27:28.555
Good. Then you don't need us.

27:29.557 --> 27:32.017
You're not the only
matrimonial agency, you know.

27:32.101 --> 27:33.184
Then go elsewhere.

27:33.769 --> 27:35.770
Not that any reputable
agency would service you.

27:35.855 --> 27:36.938
I've been elsewhere.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.191
But...

27:40.276 --> 27:43.486
This one, for me, is the best,

27:43.571 --> 27:47.032
because...

27:47.116 --> 27:48.408
I like you.

27:52.913 --> 27:55.957
You're my type of woman.

27:59.003 --> 28:00.420
Don't be ridiculous.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.088
I'm serious.

28:03.841 --> 28:08.136
I respect a woman like you, and I
know how to treat you as well.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.477
You know, in my trade...

28:15.561 --> 28:16.728
We have a saying.

28:16.812 --> 28:18.605
We put it on the fruit.

28:19.398 --> 28:22.317
"Don't squeeze the goods
till they're yours."

28:22.985 --> 28:25.153
Now, that's me.

28:26.197 --> 28:28.698
I would never do that.

28:29.784 --> 28:30.992
You know that, don't you?

28:36.332 --> 28:39.167
Excuse me. I've just remembered
a call I've got to make.

28:40.669 --> 28:42.670
There's no need
to call the police.

28:47.468 --> 28:50.261
What made you think I was
going to call the police?

28:51.180 --> 28:52.931
Just intuition, I suppose.

28:54.391 --> 28:57.268
Oh, English?

28:57.353 --> 28:58.686
Yeah, of course it is.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.194
That's a very frugal
lunch you've got there.

29:07.071 --> 29:09.114
Frugal...

29:09.198 --> 29:11.449
And mean.

29:11.534 --> 29:14.536
Certainly not enough to support a
lady with your opulent figure.

29:17.540 --> 29:21.543
Rather too opulent, I'm afraid,
these days, hence the frugality.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.878
Why don't you come out and
have a slap-up lunch with me?

29:23.963 --> 29:26.089
No, I really can't leave
the office just now.

29:26.173 --> 29:28.174
I'd buy you
the best lunch in town.

29:28.259 --> 29:30.593
No, I c...

29:32.763 --> 29:34.305
All right.

29:35.099 --> 29:37.100
It's a deal.

29:37.184 --> 29:39.394
You mean it? You'll come
and have lunch with me?

29:39.728 --> 29:41.062
Of course.

29:42.731 --> 29:44.649
Just let me wash my hands.

29:47.570 --> 29:49.320
I thought we were
going to lunch.

29:49.405 --> 29:51.281
Yes, of course
we're going to lunch.

29:51.574 --> 29:52.657
Afterwards.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.493
Ah!

29:57.037 --> 30:01.082
All right. I know what
you want, but not here.

30:01.709 --> 30:03.459
Let's go back to my place.

30:03.544 --> 30:06.421
But this is your place. You've
got nothing to worry about here.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.007
No, my secretary may
come back any minute.

30:09.091 --> 30:10.175
Really?

30:10.259 --> 30:12.677
How long do you give her
to eat her frugal lunch?

30:12.761 --> 30:15.847
Fifteen minutes.
She may be here any minute.

30:15.931 --> 30:18.224
The outside door
is locked.

30:18.309 --> 30:20.435
She's got her own key.

30:22.605 --> 30:24.480
I don't believe you.

30:25.816 --> 30:31.279
Do you know what happens to wicked
girls who tell wicked lies?

30:33.407 --> 30:34.407
Oh.

30:40.164 --> 30:42.081
Don't worry.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.209
Don't worry.

30:44.293 --> 30:45.752
You've got nothing
to worry about.

31:04.647 --> 31:06.481
Leave me alone. Please!

31:07.691 --> 31:12.779
Take the money out of my bag,
but please, leave me alone.

31:15.324 --> 31:17.784
In my bag there's,
there's enough money there

31:17.868 --> 31:20.411
to buy any woman you want.
It's yours.

31:20.496 --> 31:22.580
Take it! Just take it!

31:22.665 --> 31:26.376
I don't buy women.
It's you I want.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.002
You're my type.

31:28.337 --> 31:31.214
You are. Yes.

31:31.298 --> 31:33.341
You are my type of woman.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.971
Please, let me answer
the telephone.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.349
If you don't, the caller will
come around here in person.

31:41.433 --> 31:45.186
I told you, I locked the outer door.
We won't be disturbed.

31:46.355 --> 31:48.064
Oh, God!

31:49.233 --> 31:50.441
Leave me alone.

31:51.193 --> 31:54.279
All right. All right,
I won't struggle.

31:54.363 --> 31:56.572
But I like you to struggle.

31:56.657 --> 31:58.783
A lot of women
like to struggle.

32:01.036 --> 32:05.123
Please, don't
tear my dress.

32:05.541 --> 32:08.960
I'll take it off
if you like.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.591
Lovely.

32:16.844 --> 32:18.720
Lovely.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.098
Lovely.

32:22.182 --> 32:24.976
"Thou shall not be afraid
for the terror by night..."

32:25.060 --> 32:26.477
Lovely.

32:26.562 --> 32:28.563
"Nor for the arrow
which flieth by day..."

32:28.897 --> 32:29.897
Lovely.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.276
"Nor for the pestilence which
walketh in darkness..."

32:33.360 --> 32:34.319
Lovely!

32:34.403 --> 32:37.655
"Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday..."

32:37.740 --> 32:39.115
Lovely.

32:39.199 --> 32:41.200
"He shall give his
angels charge over thee

32:41.285 --> 32:43.244
"to guard thee
in all thy ways."

32:43.329 --> 32:44.871
Lovely!

32:45.831 --> 32:47.290
Lovely!

32:49.084 --> 32:51.044
Lovely!

32:51.837 --> 32:53.713
Lovely!

32:55.174 --> 32:57.008
Lovely.

33:03.640 --> 33:08.019
You bitch!

33:08.103 --> 33:10.563
Women!

33:10.647 --> 33:11.647
They're all the same.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.695
They are.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.697
I'll show you.

33:33.504 --> 33:36.255
My God! The tie!

33:43.472 --> 33:46.641
Dear Jesus,
help me. Help me.

36:19.628 --> 36:21.420
Hello?

36:22.130 --> 36:24.173
Anyone there?

36:24.258 --> 36:26.175
Brenda, it's Richard.

37:33.577 --> 37:34.619
Hello.

37:36.538 --> 37:38.039
Hello, Globe?

37:39.041 --> 37:40.374
May I speak to
Barbara Milligan?

37:40.459 --> 37:41.500
Is that you, Blaney?

37:42.628 --> 37:43.711
Listen, you've got
a bloody nerve

37:43.795 --> 37:45.338
ringin' up here
in my busiest time.

37:46.256 --> 37:48.674
I don't know where she is. She's
probably in the other bar.

37:48.759 --> 37:50.468
I most certainly will not
nip 'round and fetch her.

37:50.552 --> 37:52.261
She's busy and so am I...

37:52.346 --> 37:53.346
Hello, Dickie.
Is that you?

37:53.430 --> 37:55.056
Get a move on. It's not
a lonely hearts club.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.349
Here, guv.
Give us a pint.

37:56.433 --> 37:57.433
Yeah?

37:57.893 --> 37:59.352
I'm fine. How are you?

37:59.686 --> 38:02.688
I'm okay.
Look, I need my things,

38:02.773 --> 38:06.484
but I don't particularly
fancy meeting Forsythe.

38:06.568 --> 38:07.818
Do you think
you could pack 'em up,

38:07.903 --> 38:10.404
and put 'em in my bag
and meet me this afternoon?

38:11.031 --> 38:12.156
Are you sure?

38:12.240 --> 38:14.533
It'd be great if you could, but I
don't want to mess things up for you.

38:14.743 --> 38:17.411
Don't worry. It's my half-day today, silly.
Where shall I meet you?

38:17.954 --> 38:21.123
I'll be opposite the Leicester
Square Odeon, 4:00. Okay?

38:21.458 --> 38:24.752
Okay, at 4:00.
I've gotta run now. Bye.

38:25.212 --> 38:27.004
Don't start lending him money.
You'll never get it back.

38:27.089 --> 38:28.506
Why don't you mind
your own business.

38:28.590 --> 38:30.424
- He's no good for you, Babs.
- And you are?

38:30.509 --> 38:33.511
Hey, guv!
Take a whiff of this!

38:38.433 --> 38:41.977
How far from here was the place
you had lunch, Miss Barling?

38:42.062 --> 38:43.854
About five
or 10 minutes.

38:45.565 --> 38:47.400
Good afternoon, sir.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.235
Good afternoon,
one and all.

38:49.319 --> 38:52.196
This is Miss Barling, sir.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.739
Sergeant Spearman,
would you do the honors?

38:53.824 --> 38:54.907
Certainly, sir.

38:54.991 --> 38:57.201
The murdered woman
is a Mrs. Brenda Blaney.

38:57.285 --> 38:59.537
She ran this
business here, sir,

38:59.621 --> 39:01.956
and was found by her
secretary, Miss Barling,

39:02.040 --> 39:05.084
on her return from lunch
at approximately 2:00, sir.

39:08.213 --> 39:09.213
Afternoon.

39:09.297 --> 39:10.423
Afternoon, sir.

39:12.676 --> 39:14.051
Has Miss Barling
any ideas?

39:14.136 --> 39:15.469
She certainly has, sir.

39:15.637 --> 39:17.888
She says she saw the
murdered woman's ex-husband

39:17.973 --> 39:21.100
leaving the building
just as she came back, sir.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.728
I saw him clear as day.
It was Blaney, all right.

39:24.604 --> 39:27.857
He came out of the door downstairs
and walked down the alley.

39:27.941 --> 39:29.316
The beast!

39:30.485 --> 39:32.570
I'm sorry, Miss Barling.
I must press you.

39:32.654 --> 39:35.322
Are you sure
it was Mr. Blaney?

39:35.407 --> 39:38.075
Absolutely!
I'd know him anywhere.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.870
You see, he came here yesterday
afternoon, and was perfectly horrid.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.498
He'd been drinking and insisted
on seeing Mrs. Blaney.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.916
And did he see her?

39:46.001 --> 39:49.044
Yes. She'd never turn
anyone away, not even him.

39:49.129 --> 39:50.296
What happened?

39:50.380 --> 39:51.714
Oh, I don't know.

39:52.007 --> 39:53.924
They started having a row
almost immediately,

39:54.009 --> 39:56.594
and Mrs. Blaney came out
and said I might go.

39:56.678 --> 39:59.889
Well, quite naturally I didn't
want to embarrass her, so I left.

40:00.348 --> 40:02.433
As I did so,
I couldn't help overhearing

40:02.517 --> 40:04.643
that Mr. Blaney was
becoming very violent,

40:05.395 --> 40:08.105
both in his language
and his behavior.

40:08.190 --> 40:09.690
Did he strike Mrs. Blaney?

40:10.859 --> 40:12.193
Yes, I think so.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.069
There was the sound of a blow.

40:14.613 --> 40:15.696
I see.

40:17.491 --> 40:19.700
Miss Barling, could you
describe Mr. Blaney for us?

40:20.035 --> 40:22.203
What he looked like,
what he was wearing and so on.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.371
Well, yes, I think I can.

40:24.456 --> 40:28.125
He was a man in his 30s, about
an inch or so under 6' tall.

40:28.210 --> 40:30.586
He had dark hair,
green eyes and a mustache.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.214
I estimate his weight
at about 155 pounds.

40:34.216 --> 40:35.674
He was wearing a rather
old-fashioned jacket

40:35.759 --> 40:38.469
with leather patches on the
shoulders and at the elbows.

40:38.553 --> 40:40.971
In my opinion, it was
quite unsuitable for London.

40:41.056 --> 40:42.973
He was also
carrying a raincoat.

40:43.934 --> 40:46.227
That's an extraordinarily precise
description, Miss Barling.

40:47.020 --> 40:50.356
In my job I've learned to keep
a sharp eye on men, Inspector.

40:52.609 --> 40:53.818
Excuse me.

40:53.902 --> 40:55.110
I found this handbag
on the desk,

40:55.195 --> 40:56.529
and there's no
sign of any money.

40:56.738 --> 40:58.030
That doesn't make sense.

40:58.114 --> 41:01.283
I cashed a check for £50 for her at
the bank only yesterday lunchtime.

41:01.368 --> 41:04.119
It makes perfect sense to me. Where
does she keep her money in this bag?

41:04.204 --> 41:06.956
Sometimes she zips it
in the pocket.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.835
Have this face powder
identified, will you, Sergeant?

41:10.919 --> 41:13.504
There might be some on the stolen money.
We might be lucky.

41:13.588 --> 41:15.506
All right, sir.

41:15.590 --> 41:17.132
What about fingerprints?

41:17.217 --> 41:20.761
With all the clowns who come in
here, sir, there'll be dozens.

41:35.443 --> 41:36.777
Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.864
Hey, wait a moment.
How can you afford a hotel?

41:39.948 --> 41:41.407
I'll tell you later.

41:41.491 --> 41:43.075
Okay.

41:43.285 --> 41:45.077
So, what you been
up to, Dick?

41:45.161 --> 41:46.954
Well, last night...

41:47.038 --> 41:48.122
I allowed myself
to be pampered

41:48.206 --> 41:51.000
by the handmaidens
of a Salvation Army hostel.

41:51.084 --> 41:53.294
I tell you, after mixing with
some of the types in there,

41:53.378 --> 41:55.087
one's clothing
needs fumigation.

41:55.171 --> 41:56.380
Smell that.

41:56.464 --> 41:57.464
Phew!

41:57.632 --> 41:58.757
You mean you slept there?

41:58.842 --> 42:00.134
Yeah. Spasmodically.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.886
What? With all the old men?

42:02.304 --> 42:03.304
Yes, that's it.

42:03.388 --> 42:06.473
We had a high old time.
The conversation was mature,

42:06.558 --> 42:08.225
the Red Biddy flowed
down the odd throats,

42:08.310 --> 42:10.728
and the good fellowship
of the open road prevailed.

42:10.812 --> 42:12.313
Red Biddy.
What's that?

42:12.397 --> 42:16.066
Blended red wine. Half <i>vino,
</i> half mentholated spirits.

42:16.151 --> 42:17.610
But why, Dick?

42:17.694 --> 42:19.820
Reasonable terms for
bachelors, that's why.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.113
30 pence a night, in fact.

42:21.197 --> 42:22.907
I don't understand.
I mean...

42:22.991 --> 42:25.701
How can you afford
the Coburg?

42:25.785 --> 42:28.245
Well, I managed
to get some money.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.205
- Since last night?
- Yeah.

42:30.290 --> 42:32.207
I collected an old debt.

42:32.542 --> 42:34.168
Oh. That was lucky.

42:35.003 --> 42:36.503
Yeah.

42:37.797 --> 42:39.715
Okay.

43:04.449 --> 43:05.991
Thank you.

43:19.881 --> 43:21.382
Double room, please.

43:21.466 --> 43:23.092
What are you up to?
Not here!

43:23.718 --> 43:28.180
Would that be with two singles,
or the matrimonial-size bed?

43:28.431 --> 43:30.975
The mat...
Double bed. Please.

43:31.059 --> 43:33.143
Yes. I see.

43:35.313 --> 43:38.607
322 should suit you.
The Cupid Room.

43:38.858 --> 43:39.900
Really?

43:39.985 --> 43:41.986
Yes. It's very cozy.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.238
If you'll just
sign the register.

43:44.364 --> 43:45.823
Yes, of course.

43:47.742 --> 43:50.494
"Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wilde."

43:50.578 --> 43:51.829
Now, look here, Dick Blaney!

43:51.913 --> 43:53.038
Oscar, if you don't mind.

43:53.123 --> 43:55.541
Dick, will you stop playing games?
I can't possibly...

43:55.625 --> 44:01.255
Excuse me. That'll be £10,
plus service charge of £2.

44:02.549 --> 44:04.925
Perhaps you'd
care to settle now?

44:09.097 --> 44:10.681
- There we are.
- Thank you.

44:10.765 --> 44:11.765
Room, please?

44:11.850 --> 44:13.225
322, Bertie.

44:19.441 --> 44:21.066
Follow me, please.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.701
You've got 322.
That's nice.

44:30.785 --> 44:33.370
Yes. The Cupid Room,
I think she called it.

44:33.455 --> 44:34.580
Love's little arrows
have struck

44:34.664 --> 44:36.498
quite a few hearts in there,
sir, I can tell you.

44:36.583 --> 44:37.624
Oh, yeah.

44:39.294 --> 44:41.503
Can I get you anything
from the pharmacy, sir?

44:41.588 --> 44:42.671
No, thank you.

44:52.932 --> 44:54.725
- Ta.
- Thank you, sir.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.439
- Hey!
- Sir?

45:01.399 --> 45:04.068
Hang on. Can you send this
to the cleaners for me?

45:04.152 --> 45:05.486
- Certainly, sir.
- And this.

45:05.945 --> 45:07.821
Tell them that it's urgent.

45:08.364 --> 45:12.117
And might as well take
the other half as well.

45:12.202 --> 45:14.244
Tell them that
I want them sprayed.

45:14.329 --> 45:16.413
Sprayed, sir? With what?

45:16.498 --> 45:18.082
DDT, my good man.
What else?

45:18.166 --> 45:19.249
Sir?

45:19.334 --> 45:21.460
Death to the lurking
roach, porter.

45:21.544 --> 45:23.837
Confusion to
the insidious louse.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.339
Get 'em cleaned
and pressed, eh?

45:25.423 --> 45:26.423
Yes, sir.

46:22.147 --> 46:23.730
Oh, dear!

46:25.900 --> 46:28.235
Hey, Glad,
take a look at this.

46:33.950 --> 46:36.869
Oh! Oh, that poor woman.

46:36.953 --> 46:40.914
It's the jacket, Glad, I'm talkin' about.
The jacket! See what it says?

46:40.999 --> 46:42.833
"The police are
anxious to interview a man

46:42.917 --> 46:44.668
"seen leaving
the matrimonial agency

46:44.752 --> 46:46.461
"about the time
of the murder.

46:46.546 --> 46:48.714
"When last seen
he was wearing a tweed jacket

46:48.798 --> 46:52.009
"with leather patches
on the shoulders and elbows

46:52.093 --> 46:53.677
"and carrying a raincoat."

46:53.761 --> 46:55.596
That's a funny way
to patch a jacket.

46:55.722 --> 46:57.514
It's meant to be
like that, Glad.

46:57.599 --> 47:00.225
The party in 322
was wearin' it.

47:00.810 --> 47:04.188
Do you mean... Do you
mean Mr. Oscar Wilde?

47:04.272 --> 47:08.066
That's not his real name, silly.
Oscar Wilde, indeed!

47:08.151 --> 47:10.402
He's the fellow
the police are looking for.

47:10.486 --> 47:12.446
Don't you see?
He's the necktie murderer.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.698
And we've got him upstairs
at this very minute!

47:15.325 --> 47:17.242
Oh, dear!
I only hope that girl

47:17.327 --> 47:19.494
isn't wearing a necktie
at this very moment.

47:19.829 --> 47:23.498
I can't believe it!
Not in the Cupid Room!

47:23.583 --> 47:26.335
You know, Glad, sometimes just
thinkin' about the lusts of men

47:26.419 --> 47:28.378
makes me want to heave.

47:28.463 --> 47:30.839
Hello. Will you give me
the police, please?

47:34.469 --> 47:36.511
Hello, police?

47:36.596 --> 47:39.389
I'm the porter of
the Coburg Hotel, Bayswater.

47:39.474 --> 47:42.100
Could you come at once? I've got
this fellow you're looking for here.

47:42.185 --> 47:44.686
You know,
the necktie murderer.

47:44.771 --> 47:46.563
He came here with a girl.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.153
Come away, Glad. You're not
to do anything suspicious.

48:48.668 --> 48:50.127
Open up!

48:52.171 --> 48:53.755
Open up! Police!

49:09.272 --> 49:11.315
They must've gone
down the back stairs.

49:15.945 --> 49:17.946
But I ask you,
in all conscience,

49:18.031 --> 49:19.656
is it likely I would
murder a woman

49:19.741 --> 49:21.658
I'd been married
to for 10 years?

49:21.743 --> 49:23.243
If it was true,
it would be horrible.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.830
And rape her, after 10 years of marriage?
Violently rape her?

49:26.914 --> 49:28.915
I don't know. I'm always
hearing of kinky things.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.167
Perhaps you was
jealous of her.

49:30.251 --> 49:31.668
Of Brenda?
Oh, come off it.

49:31.753 --> 49:33.253
I didn't know Brenda.
It's possible.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.880
Maybe you just wanted
to get rid of her.

49:34.964 --> 49:36.673
But I had got rid of her.

49:36.758 --> 49:39.551
We were divorced, remember.
We had been for two years.

49:39.635 --> 49:42.429
There was no question of alimony.
She earned far more than me.

49:43.306 --> 49:46.266
You got that money from her, didn't you?
You never collected a debt.

49:47.352 --> 49:48.977
Well, yes, I did.

49:49.062 --> 49:51.730
But she gave it to me the night
before when we had dinner.

49:51.814 --> 49:53.065
20 pounds.

49:53.149 --> 49:54.649
Why lie about it, then?

49:55.777 --> 49:58.195
I suppose I was ashamed
to admit it, that's all.

49:58.279 --> 50:00.739
That makes sense,
I suppose.

50:00.823 --> 50:01.823
But here, wait a mo.

50:01.908 --> 50:03.158
If Brenda gave you
the money at dinner,

50:03.242 --> 50:04.618
why'd you sleep
in the doss-house?

50:04.702 --> 50:06.203
You could've
afforded a hotel.

50:06.287 --> 50:08.372
I didn't realize
that I had it.

50:08.456 --> 50:10.415
She slipped it into the
pocket of my raincoat.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.833
Oh, go on, Dick.

50:11.918 --> 50:13.585
Why don't you pull the other one?
It's got bells on it.

50:13.669 --> 50:14.669
But it's true!

50:15.797 --> 50:17.339
I suppose she didn't
want to embarrass me.

50:18.007 --> 50:20.258
You've got to admit
it is pretty tall.

50:20.343 --> 50:22.469
Well, it's not as tall
as me sleeping

50:22.553 --> 50:24.638
in a doss-house with
20 quid in my pocket!

50:24.722 --> 50:27.432
If I knew I had it, I'd never
have gone there, would I?

50:27.517 --> 50:28.558
Maybe.

50:28.643 --> 50:30.102
Maybe!
You smelled that jacket!

50:30.186 --> 50:31.895
Would you sleep there
if you didn't have to?

50:31.979 --> 50:33.980
It wasn't that bad,
that jacket.

50:34.065 --> 50:35.399
I still think
it's a bit suspicious,

50:35.483 --> 50:36.817
your sending it
to the cleaners.

50:36.984 --> 50:38.110
Suspicious of what?

50:38.194 --> 50:40.695
In them sex cases, they always
do a lab test on the clothes.

50:40.780 --> 50:42.823
It stank to high heaven!

50:42.907 --> 50:44.908
That's why.
You know it did.

50:48.121 --> 50:51.498
Barbara, I swear
I'm telling the truth.

50:51.749 --> 50:54.835
Now, do I look like
a sex murderer to you?

50:54.919 --> 50:57.087
Can you imagine me
creeping around London,

50:57.171 --> 50:59.923
strangling all
those women with ties?

51:00.007 --> 51:01.591
That's ridiculous.

51:01.676 --> 51:03.427
For a start,
I only own two.

51:05.012 --> 51:08.432
Well, it's true. That jacket
was a bit smelly and...

51:08.516 --> 51:10.058
I suppose if you had
known about the money,

51:10.143 --> 51:13.395
you wouldn't have stayed with
a lot of old men like that.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.605
Then you believe me?

51:16.023 --> 51:17.899
Thousands wouldn't.

51:17.984 --> 51:19.901
Thanks.

51:22.029 --> 51:24.614
I must be soft in the head
lettin' a suspected strangler

51:24.699 --> 51:27.033
put his arms around me.

51:27.535 --> 51:28.702
Shows you trust me.

51:28.828 --> 51:30.036
I suppose so.

51:34.500 --> 51:37.544
Hey, what we gonna do? The
police will be looking for you!

51:38.129 --> 51:39.588
I don't know.
I haven't thought yet.

51:39.672 --> 51:40.797
Well, there's only
one thing you can do.

51:40.882 --> 51:42.883
Go and see 'em. Tell them what
happened, like you told me.

51:42.967 --> 51:44.134
No, I can't do that.

51:44.218 --> 51:45.302
You've got to!

51:45.386 --> 51:46.470
They'd never believe me.

51:46.554 --> 51:47.804
Why not? I did.

51:47.889 --> 51:51.308
You're not the law. I'm
probably their only suspect.

51:51.392 --> 51:54.978
You just have to go along and persuade
them to search for someone else.

51:55.062 --> 51:59.608
I mean, one look at you and they'd
know you wasn't a sadistic killer.

51:59.692 --> 52:00.817
Blaney!

52:00.902 --> 52:01.902
Come on!

52:04.447 --> 52:05.447
Dicko!

52:49.450 --> 52:53.328
Haven't done any of this cloak-and-dagger
stuff since the Suez business.

52:53.412 --> 52:56.248
That's when I first met Dicko,
in the squadron, you know.

52:56.332 --> 52:59.292
He was a bit of
a split-assed type then too.

53:13.099 --> 53:15.475
Hetty, you
remember Dicko, don't you?

53:15.560 --> 53:16.810
Of course. Come in.

53:16.894 --> 53:18.103
And...
This is Miss Milligan.

53:18.312 --> 53:19.396
Hello, Miss Milligan.

53:19.605 --> 53:21.189
Pleased to meet you.

53:21.274 --> 53:22.816
I bumped into them
in the park.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.401
How fortunate!

53:24.485 --> 53:26.069
We haven't seen you
in ages, Dick.

53:26.153 --> 53:29.197
How's Brenda?
Do you still hear from her?

53:31.450 --> 53:34.160
Well, she's dead,
I'm afraid.

53:34.328 --> 53:36.621
Yes.

53:36.706 --> 53:38.373
And you killed her!

53:38.457 --> 53:40.917
Steady on, Hetty.
He didn't do it.

53:41.002 --> 53:42.085
He's just been
telling me all about it.

53:42.169 --> 53:43.169
Has he, now?

53:46.048 --> 53:49.384
You see, he was seen near the
place where Brenda was murdered.

53:49.468 --> 53:53.430
So the police think he's the strangler
chap. But he's not, of course.

53:53.514 --> 53:55.724
All he wants is
a place to hide out.

53:56.392 --> 53:59.436
And you suggested
he should stay here.

54:00.605 --> 54:02.606
Well, yes.
It seemed a good idea.

54:02.690 --> 54:04.566
Nobody ever knows
who's staying here.

54:04.650 --> 54:07.944
You're a bloody fool, Johnny, getting
yourself involved like this.

54:08.571 --> 54:09.738
But he didn't do it.

54:09.989 --> 54:11.197
Of course he did it!

54:11.532 --> 54:12.699
What, old Dicko?

54:12.783 --> 54:16.578
Yes, old Dicko, the chivalrous
knight of the skies!

54:16.704 --> 54:18.663
He always treated her
like a shit!

54:18.748 --> 54:20.707
Really, Hetty, I think
you're absolutely wrong.

54:21.667 --> 54:24.294
Don't you remember that
disgusting divorce petition?

54:25.504 --> 54:27.255
The things you did to her!

54:27.423 --> 54:28.673
Divorce petition?

54:28.883 --> 54:30.342
Oh, didn't he tell you?

54:30.426 --> 54:32.636
Did he forget to mention
he was divorced from his wife

54:32.720 --> 54:34.929
on the grounds of
extreme cruelty?

54:35.681 --> 54:37.057
Thank you very much.

54:38.559 --> 54:39.934
Well, is it true?

54:41.228 --> 54:42.479
Yes!

54:42.688 --> 54:45.607
Both extreme mental
and physical cruelty.

54:46.442 --> 54:48.526
Depravity was
mentioned, I think.

54:48.611 --> 54:51.863
It had to read that way, but there
wasn't a word of truth in it!

54:51.947 --> 54:54.074
The lawyers made
the whole thing up.

54:54.158 --> 54:55.825
You see neither of us
wanted to wait three years

54:55.910 --> 54:58.036
until I could get a divorce
on the grounds of desertion,

54:58.120 --> 55:00.330
so I allowed her to divorce me
on the grounds of cruelty.

55:00.414 --> 55:02.082
Extreme cruelty.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.377
I wonder if the police
have read a copy of it.

55:08.589 --> 55:09.839
My God!

55:11.175 --> 55:13.593
Yes, I'm sure
they'll be fascinated.

55:13.761 --> 55:15.345
He's innocent,
Mrs. Porter, I know he is.

55:15.429 --> 55:17.514
You know it?
How do you know it?

55:17.598 --> 55:19.182
Well, as you say,
they'd been divorced.

55:19.266 --> 55:20.975
There was no call
for him to do her in.

55:21.060 --> 55:23.978
There's no spiteful act
I'd put past old Dicko here,

55:24.689 --> 55:26.815
especially
if he were drunk.

55:26.899 --> 55:29.359
Were you drunk when you did it?
Was that it?

55:29.443 --> 55:31.027
I didn't do it, Hetty.

55:31.112 --> 55:33.238
I didn't do it! I swear!

55:33.322 --> 55:34.864
Then why don't you
go to the police

55:34.949 --> 55:36.825
and explain to them
instead of involving Johnny?

55:37.284 --> 55:39.703
I didn't want to involve him.
He insisted.

55:39.787 --> 55:42.372
That's right, I did. Can't
abandon a chap in trouble.

55:42.456 --> 55:46.167
I still say, why don't you go
to the police and inform them?

55:46.252 --> 55:47.919
They'd never believe
him, that's why.

55:48.003 --> 55:51.089
He's the only suspect
they've got, poor lamb,

55:51.173 --> 55:52.632
and with all the
evidence against him,

55:52.717 --> 55:55.719
they'd lock him up without
so much as a by-your-leave.

55:55.803 --> 55:59.389
Oh, please hide him,
Mrs. Porter, just for tonight,

55:59.473 --> 56:01.725
until we can think
what's best to do.

56:01.809 --> 56:05.812
Of course we'll hide him. Can't
throw an old comrade to the cops.

56:05.896 --> 56:09.065
Well, if you want to be arrested
for harboring a wanted man

56:09.150 --> 56:12.026
or subverting the course
of justice or whatever,

56:12.111 --> 56:14.028
on your own
head be it, Johnny.

56:14.113 --> 56:16.364
But I wash my hands
of the matter.

56:16.449 --> 56:18.116
Thank God we're off to
Paris tomorrow morning.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.743
That's all I can say.

56:19.827 --> 56:23.329
That is, if we're not all in jail!
I'm going shopping.

56:30.755 --> 56:31.963
Perhaps I'd better go.

56:32.089 --> 56:33.256
Nonsense, old chap.

56:33.340 --> 56:36.885
Don't worry about Hetty. I'll calm her
down. You can use the sofa tonight.

56:36.969 --> 56:38.928
I must be off.
I'm ever so late already.

56:39.013 --> 56:40.346
What do you do,
Miss Milligan?

56:40.431 --> 56:41.431
I work in a pub.

56:41.515 --> 56:42.766
Same place he used to be.

56:42.850 --> 56:44.100
Really?

56:44.185 --> 56:46.519
Why don't both of you
slip out of the country

56:46.604 --> 56:48.021
till this whole
thing's blown over?

56:48.105 --> 56:49.355
Come and give me
a hand at the Bulldog.

56:49.774 --> 56:50.857
Bulldog?

56:50.941 --> 56:54.944
It's an English pub I've opened in Paris.
They're the new thing there.

56:55.029 --> 56:57.655
That's a great idea.
Why don't we?

56:57.740 --> 57:00.033
Not likely. I never was
any good at French.

57:00.117 --> 57:01.993
Well, you don't have to be.
It's an English pub.

57:02.077 --> 57:04.120
As long as you can say non,
you'll be all right.

57:06.207 --> 57:07.207
Well...

57:07.291 --> 57:08.374
Come on, Babs.

57:08.459 --> 57:10.335
You don't like the Globe
any more than I did.

57:10.419 --> 57:12.337
Look, meet me
at Victoria Station

57:12.421 --> 57:14.422
tomorrow morning, 11:00,
by the flower stall.

57:14.632 --> 57:16.466
We can shoot down to the coast
and get a day trip to France.

57:16.550 --> 57:18.051
You don't need a passport.

57:19.845 --> 57:20.845
Okay.

57:20.930 --> 57:22.096
Splendid!

57:22.348 --> 57:23.807
Froggies will
roll over and die

57:23.891 --> 57:25.266
at the sight of
a real English barmaid.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.187
I must go now, really.
You know Forsythe.

57:32.149 --> 57:35.401
Mum's the word, eh?
Don't tell a soul I'm here.

57:35.486 --> 57:37.570
Cross me heart
and hope to die.

57:39.740 --> 57:40.907
Thanks for
lookin' after him.

57:40.991 --> 57:41.991
Not at all, my dear.

57:42.076 --> 57:43.743
I'll come see you
to the lift.

58:34.837 --> 58:37.797
Enjoying that,
are you, sir?

58:37.882 --> 58:41.384
Sergeant, my wife is
currently taking a course

58:41.468 --> 58:44.178
at the Continental School
of Gourmet Cooking.

58:44.263 --> 58:45.597
Apparently they've never
heard of the principle,

58:45.681 --> 58:49.267
"To eat well in this country, one must
have breakfast three times a day."

58:49.351 --> 58:50.727
And an English
breakfast at that.

58:50.811 --> 58:52.437
I don't mean
your café complet.

58:52.771 --> 58:54.188
Beg pardon, sir?

58:54.273 --> 58:55.732
It's a cup of coffee
half an inch deep

58:55.816 --> 58:59.319
in floating bits of boiled milk,
and a sweet bun full of air.

58:59.403 --> 59:00.486
That's what I had
this morning.

59:00.571 --> 59:01.738
I see what you mean, sir.

59:01.947 --> 59:04.908
I'm a...
A Quaker Oats man, myself.

59:07.578 --> 59:09.662
Excuse me, sir.

59:09.747 --> 59:10.997
This has just come in.

59:11.081 --> 59:12.874
It's the lab report
on the £10 note

59:12.958 --> 59:14.667
that Blaney used to pay
the hotel bill with.

59:14.752 --> 59:15.752
Yes.

59:15.836 --> 59:19.088
Well, as you'll see, the note
bore traces of face powder

59:19.173 --> 59:21.341
identical to that which we found
in Mrs. Blaney's handbag.

59:21.425 --> 59:22.425
Thank you.

59:22.509 --> 59:23.551
Thank you, sir.

59:24.803 --> 59:27.055
Well, Sergeant,
we were in luck after all.

59:27.139 --> 59:29.766
Yes, sir. That just about
does it for him, I'd say.

59:29.850 --> 59:31.184
Looks very much like it.

59:31.268 --> 59:34.646
I've never run into any of
these jokers before, sir.

59:34.730 --> 59:36.439
What are they like?

59:36.523 --> 59:39.150
Oh, they vary,
but not a lot.

59:39.234 --> 59:40.693
The important thing
to remember is

59:40.778 --> 59:42.195
they hate women,
and are mostly impotent.

59:42.279 --> 59:43.696
Impotent?

59:44.198 --> 59:47.700
Don't mistake rape
for potency, Sergeant.

59:48.369 --> 59:49.494
In the latter stage
of the disease,

59:49.578 --> 59:51.871
it's the strangling, not the
sex, that brings them on.

59:53.290 --> 59:55.416
Above all, of course,
they're sadists.

59:55.501 --> 59:57.043
You know what they are,
Sergeant, I'm sure.

59:57.127 --> 59:58.127
Oh, yes, sir.

59:58.212 --> 01:00:00.296
And if you don't, you can
read all about it in there,

01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:02.465
Mrs. Blaney's
divorce petition.

01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:04.968
It tells you a great deal
about the habits of our hero.

01:00:07.721 --> 01:00:09.389
Yeah?

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:11.808
Right. Put him on.

01:00:11.892 --> 01:00:13.309
Yes, Chief Inspector
Oxford speaking.

01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:17.105
My name is Forsythe, Inspector.
Felix Forsythe.

01:00:17.189 --> 01:00:19.607
I run the Globe Public House,
Covent Garden.

01:00:19.692 --> 01:00:23.236
Now, I see from the newspaper you're
in charge of these strangling cases.

01:00:23.404 --> 01:00:24.737
Yes, Mr. Forsythe,
that is so.

01:00:25.072 --> 01:00:27.657
Good, because I've got
some information to impart.

01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:29.993
Now, this man
you're looking for,

01:00:30.077 --> 01:00:32.578
the one with the patches
on his suit.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:35.999
I know him. He worked
here as a barman.

01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:39.335
His name is Richard Blaney.
He's a right bastard.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.504
Are you quite certain
it's the same man?

01:00:44.425 --> 01:00:46.592
Gone off with your barmaid? What
exactly do you mean by "gone off"?

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:49.721
Well, she's been out all night
with him and hasn't yet returned.

01:00:49.805 --> 01:00:51.597
And I felt it
my duty to tell you

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.766
that I consider her
to be in great danger.

01:00:54.101 --> 01:00:56.019
That is, of course, if she's
still alive and kicking.

01:00:56.603 --> 01:00:58.354
Well, thank you for your
information, Mr. Forsythe.

01:00:58.439 --> 01:01:00.815
Tell me, what does this
barmaid of yours look like?

01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:09.323
Well, then, I can set your mind
at rest on one point at least.

01:01:09.408 --> 01:01:11.701
She was alive and running
at 8:00 this morning.

01:01:11.785 --> 01:01:13.453
8:00 this morning?

01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:16.456
Well, where is she now?
We opened at 11:00!

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.667
What I want to know is, is
she coming back here or not?

01:01:19.752 --> 01:01:21.252
She's left
all her clothes here.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:23.296
I expect she'll turn up
sooner or later.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.006
These days,
ladies abandon their honor

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:26.632
far more readily
than their clothes.

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:28.468
Thank you for your
information, Mr. Forsythe.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:29.927
I'll send someone over.

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:32.096
That was Forsythe,

01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:34.307
manager of the Globe Public
House, Covent Garden.

01:01:40.355 --> 01:01:43.232
Well, I tell you what, Jim, I'm glad
I'm not in the potato business.

01:01:43.317 --> 01:01:45.026
Got enough troubles
of me own.

01:01:45.152 --> 01:01:46.861
Yeah, you're not
a bad judge, Bob.

01:01:46.945 --> 01:01:49.572
The potato business
is poison, always was.

01:01:49.656 --> 01:01:51.324
It costs a fortune
to dig 'em up,

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.992
another fortune
to transport them.

01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:56.662
And what do you have at the end?
Hardly any money for them.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:58.414
Mostly you can't sell them.

01:01:58.499 --> 01:02:01.751
I've got to send a truckload
back up to Lincolnshire tonight.

01:02:01.835 --> 01:02:03.252
And what will they
do with them?

01:02:03.337 --> 01:02:05.129
They'll plow them back in.

01:02:05.214 --> 01:02:07.090
Can you beat it?

01:02:07.174 --> 01:02:08.925
And they say there's people
hungry in this world.

01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:10.426
True, Jim.

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:12.011
And there are
a few thirsty as well.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.971
Come on, have one
with your Uncle Bob.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.267
Good afternoon!

01:02:18.352 --> 01:02:19.936
Just a minute. Where do
you think you've been?

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.022
Your half-day was yesterday
afternoon, not this morning.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:24.607
You took a hell of
a chance, didn't you,

01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:26.109
spending the night
with a murderer?

01:02:26.193 --> 01:02:27.693
How do you know I spent
the night with anyone?

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:28.903
Now come off it.

01:02:28.987 --> 01:02:31.280
You took his clothes to him. You didn't
come home. It stands to reason.

01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:32.824
Why don't you mind
your own bleeding business?

01:02:32.908 --> 01:02:34.242
Don't talk to me
like that, girl.

01:02:34.326 --> 01:02:36.744
I was worried about you.
I thought you might be next.

01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:38.621
I even phoned the police.

01:02:38.705 --> 01:02:39.956
- Police?
- Yeah. They wanna talk to you.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.541
They're sending a fella
over from Scotland Yard.

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:42.625
Why?

01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:44.627
Why? Because they want
your lover. That's why.

01:02:44.711 --> 01:02:45.670
They wanna
pick him up and put him

01:02:45.754 --> 01:02:47.004
where he can't strangle
any more women!

01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:48.131
And you'd better help 'em.

01:02:48.215 --> 01:02:50.133
The sooner that madman's
behind bars the better.

01:02:50.217 --> 01:02:51.676
Don't you talk
about him like that!

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.470
You don't realize how lucky
you are to be alive!

01:02:54.555 --> 01:02:55.763
Christ Almighty, Babs,

01:02:55.848 --> 01:02:58.391
if I wasn't shorthanded, I'd take
you down to Scotland Yard myself!

01:02:58.475 --> 01:02:59.934
As it is, right after
closing time...

01:03:00.018 --> 01:03:01.185
I won't be here!

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.062
And you can stuff your rotten
job right up your jacksy!

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:04.147
Come back, you!

01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:05.231
Oh, balls!

01:03:12.364 --> 01:03:14.240
Got a place to stay?

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:15.658
Oh, it's you, Bob.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.326
Yeah.

01:03:17.536 --> 01:03:19.162
I heard that ding-dong
you had with Forsythe.

01:03:19.246 --> 01:03:20.830
Oh, he's a right bastard.

01:03:20.914 --> 01:03:22.415
Well, of course he is.

01:03:29.548 --> 01:03:30.673
You can stay
at my place

01:03:30.757 --> 01:03:33.301
till you get something
sorted out, if you want.

01:03:33.886 --> 01:03:36.470
I won't be in your way. I'm
going up north for a few days.

01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:37.680
No strings?

01:03:37.764 --> 01:03:39.640
Now, do I look like
that sort of a bloke?

01:03:39.725 --> 01:03:43.186
All blokes are
that sort of a bloke.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.437
Are you really
goin' away?

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:45.897
Sure! Tonight.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:49.108
You can have the place to yourself.
I'll take you there now.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:50.651
And if you like,
I'll go back to the Globe

01:03:50.736 --> 01:03:52.111
and pick up
your stuff for you.

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.363
Now, I can't say
fairer than that, can I?

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:55.740
Oh, thanks, Bob.

01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:57.366
I'll just stay the one
night if you don't mind.

01:03:57.451 --> 01:03:58.451
Suit yourself.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.119
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to...

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:03.122
I'm going to
my sister in Southall.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:05.666
Leaving your boyfriend in the
lurch a bit, aren't you?

01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:07.835
He has to make up
his own mind what to do.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.380
Well, you know, I'd like to help him
if I could. Where's he hiding out?

01:04:11.465 --> 01:04:13.591
- I can't tell you, Bob. I promised.
- Oh.

01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:14.884
Come on, Babs.

01:04:14.968 --> 01:04:17.220
Dick and me have always been mates.
You know that.

01:04:17.304 --> 01:04:19.222
I can't.

01:04:19.306 --> 01:04:22.141
All right.
Keep your little secret.

01:04:23.352 --> 01:04:25.895
You know, changing jobs can
be a blessing in disguise.

01:04:25.979 --> 01:04:27.897
It gets you
out of a rut.

01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:31.192
A girl like you ought to
travel, see the world a bit.

01:04:31.276 --> 01:04:34.612
The Cape, California, Jaffa.
Where the fruit comes from,

01:04:34.696 --> 01:04:37.323
that's where I'd like to go
if I wasn't tied down here.

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.742
But you, you can do
as you please!

01:04:39.826 --> 01:04:42.787
You've got the whole
of your life ahead of you.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.501
Here we are.
I'm on the second floor.

01:05:07.688 --> 01:05:10.564
I don't know
if you know it, Babs,

01:05:10.649 --> 01:05:12.858
but you're
my type of woman.

01:06:17.299 --> 01:06:18.799
Is that you, Tim?

01:06:18.884 --> 01:06:20.593
Hello, dear.

01:06:20.927 --> 01:06:22.720
Hungry?

01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:24.513
- Yes.
- Good.

01:06:24.598 --> 01:06:26.349
I'll bring it right in.

01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:32.021
It's a soupe de poisson, dear.

01:06:32.105 --> 01:06:33.773
I know you'll enjoy it.

01:06:33.899 --> 01:06:35.566
Say, I have
no doubt of it.

01:06:36.276 --> 01:06:39.445
Don't wait for me. I'm just going
to see to the next course.

01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:44.533
Well...

01:06:44.618 --> 01:06:47.870
What's new in the case?
Any sensational breaks?

01:06:47.954 --> 01:06:53.042
No. I'll be glad when we get
Mr. Richard Blaney inside, though.

01:06:53.126 --> 01:06:55.044
Any idea where he is?

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:01.467
No, our only lead to him
left her job this morning.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.136
What's more, I don't know
where she is either.

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:06.013
You're certain
he's the one?

01:07:06.098 --> 01:07:08.682
Oh, yes,
he's the one, all right.

01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:10.684
There's not even the
complication of another suspect.

01:07:10.769 --> 01:07:12.812
It has to be him.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:21.070
We have him identified as
leaving the matrimonial agency

01:07:21.154 --> 01:07:23.155
at the time his ex was killed.

01:07:24.116 --> 01:07:25.866
We have the clothes
which he found necessary

01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:27.993
to send to the cleaners
in a hurry.

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.998
And we have the evidence of the face
powder in the Salvation Army hostel.

01:07:33.834 --> 01:07:35.709
I don't follow you,
my dear.

01:07:35.794 --> 01:07:38.671
I didn't think the Salvation
Army girls used makeup.

01:07:39.714 --> 01:07:44.093
No, Blaney slept in a Salvation
Army hostel the night before last.

01:07:44.177 --> 01:07:45.553
Did he, dear?

01:07:45.637 --> 01:07:47.304
Yes.

01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:53.060
He was incautious enough
to tell them his name.

01:07:53.145 --> 01:07:55.688
I don't think an ex-RAF officer
would sleep in such a place

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.273
unless he was broke, do you?

01:07:57.357 --> 01:07:58.732
No, I don't.

01:07:59.151 --> 01:08:01.569
So, let's assume he was.

01:08:03.155 --> 01:08:06.282
Last night, however,
he slept in the...

01:08:06.366 --> 01:08:07.867
Coburg Hotel in Bayswater

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:12.037
and paid for his extremely
expensive room with a £10 note.

01:08:13.498 --> 01:08:15.416
The note bore traces
of the same face powder

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.750
we found in
Mrs. Blaney's handbag.

01:08:16.835 --> 01:08:20.379
I mean, the murderer not
only strangled Mrs. Blaney,

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.131
he stole money from
her handbag as well.

01:08:22.215 --> 01:08:23.215
Ergo...

01:08:24.426 --> 01:08:27.219
Blaney is the thief
and also the murderer.

01:08:28.388 --> 01:08:30.430
That ties it up then.

01:08:30.765 --> 01:08:33.058
Well, I think so.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:36.812
And furthermore,
there is a waitress

01:08:36.897 --> 01:08:39.564
at Mrs. Blaney's club
who can also testify

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:40.983
to Blaney's
aggressive behavior

01:08:41.067 --> 01:08:42.401
towards his wife
the previous night.

01:08:43.737 --> 01:08:45.821
He doesn't seem to have been
very discreet, does he?

01:08:46.198 --> 01:08:48.323
No. Discretion is
not traditionally

01:08:48.408 --> 01:08:50.451
the strong suit of
the psychopath, dear.

01:08:50.535 --> 01:08:52.203
Believe me, that's
what we're dealing with.

01:08:52.578 --> 01:08:55.456
You ought to read his
wife's divorce petition.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.124
What exactly is in this soup?

01:08:57.959 --> 01:08:59.502
Why? Don't you like it?

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:00.836
Mmm.

01:09:01.587 --> 01:09:03.171
It's delicious.

01:09:04.424 --> 01:09:05.966
But I find the...

01:09:06.259 --> 01:09:08.928
Ingredients are
somewhat mystifying.

01:09:09.763 --> 01:09:12.515
They're smelts, ling,

01:09:12.599 --> 01:09:14.934
conger eel, John Dory,

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:19.354
pilchards and frogfish.

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:21.857
And now, since that must've
been fairly satisfying,

01:09:21.942 --> 01:09:25.361
I thought a simple roast
bird would be enough.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.826
Caille aux raisins.

01:09:33.787 --> 01:09:34.787
Hmm?

01:09:34.912 --> 01:09:37.081
Quail with...

01:09:37.165 --> 01:09:39.082
Grapes.

01:09:45.256 --> 01:09:47.299
I must say,
I'm very worried.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:49.009
- About Mr. Blaney?
- Yes.

01:09:49.469 --> 01:09:52.388
He's gone off with a barmaid
he used to work with.

01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:55.891
I think she's in
very great danger.

01:09:55.976 --> 01:09:59.061
You're wrong, Tim.
Absolutely wrong.

01:09:59.312 --> 01:10:01.021
It can't be this fellow.

01:10:01.523 --> 01:10:03.482
How long did you say
he was married?

01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:05.276
Ten years.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.820
Well, there you are.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:12.116
A <i>crime de passion</i>
after all that time?

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.703
Look at us. We've only
been married eight years,

01:10:15.787 --> 01:10:19.081
and you can hardly keep
your eyes open at night.

01:10:19.165 --> 01:10:20.124
Well, that as may be.

01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:24.587
But I don't knock you about or
make you do degrading things.

01:10:24.671 --> 01:10:27.089
No, the evidence
speaks for itself.

01:10:27.173 --> 01:10:31.302
Besides, you can't make normal
judgments about psychopathic killers.

01:10:31.386 --> 01:10:33.262
They can be triggered
off at any time.

01:10:33.638 --> 01:10:36.307
We've got to find him
before his...

01:10:36.391 --> 01:10:38.642
Appetite is whetted again.

01:14:52.063 --> 01:14:54.314
Christ all-bloody-mighty!

01:15:45.158 --> 01:15:46.950
See you, mate.

01:18:20.313 --> 01:18:23.148
You bitch!
Where's that bloody pin?

01:18:45.296 --> 01:18:47.798
Hey, you're
spilling your load!

01:18:47.882 --> 01:18:48.882
What?

01:18:48.966 --> 01:18:51.301
The potatoes. They're
falling on the road.

01:20:44.498 --> 01:20:45.707
Argh!

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:45.720
Hey, do you see
what I see?

01:24:19.171 --> 01:24:21.047
Here, what's wrong...

01:24:21.215 --> 01:24:22.757
Who is it?

01:24:22.842 --> 01:24:25.176
Perhaps
you can tell us.

01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:27.262
- Wake up!
- What?

01:24:27.346 --> 01:24:28.388
Get out of here.

01:24:28.514 --> 01:24:29.597
What is it?

01:24:29.682 --> 01:24:31.266
Brenda wasn't
enough for you.

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:33.059
You had to kill
another girl too!

01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:34.602
- What girl?
- You know, all right.

01:24:34.687 --> 01:24:36.771
That girl you
brought here yesterday.

01:24:36.856 --> 01:24:38.064
Babs?

01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:40.108
As if you didn't know.

01:24:40.192 --> 01:24:43.278
You strangled her
like all the others!

01:24:43.362 --> 01:24:45.405
She's been strangled?

01:24:45.489 --> 01:24:49.742
Don't you play act with me.
Get up and get out of here.

01:24:49.827 --> 01:24:51.035
I'd call the police
myself if I knew

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.537
how to do it
without getting involved.

01:24:52.872 --> 01:24:55.707
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.793
It's true, Dicko. It just
came over on the radio.

01:24:58.878 --> 01:25:01.629
They found her in a potato
truck in Lincolnshire.

01:25:01.714 --> 01:25:03.631
The fellow at the pub where
you worked identified her.

01:25:03.716 --> 01:25:06.634
He knows where they found her.
He put her there!

01:25:06.719 --> 01:25:08.887
What are you talking about? I
haven't left this room all night.

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:10.763
Liar. I don't
believe you.

01:25:10.848 --> 01:25:13.141
Hetty, it doesn't matter whether
you believe him or not,

01:25:13.225 --> 01:25:15.059
because it said on the
radio that Miss Milligan

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:16.811
had been dead for
at least 12 hours

01:25:16.896 --> 01:25:18.605
when they found her
at 3:00 this morning.

01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:20.523
Now, that means that
she must've been killed

01:25:20.608 --> 01:25:22.275
before 3:00
yesterday afternoon.

01:25:22.359 --> 01:25:24.194
And Dick was here with us
from the time she left

01:25:24.278 --> 01:25:25.320
to the time
we went to bed.

01:25:25.404 --> 01:25:26.654
So he couldn't have
done it.

01:25:27.698 --> 01:25:28.907
Poor kid.

01:25:29.033 --> 01:25:30.241
I still
don't believe it.

01:25:30.618 --> 01:25:32.827
They're only guessing
when she was killed.

01:25:32.912 --> 01:25:34.454
We didn't go to
bed till 11:00,

01:25:34.538 --> 01:25:35.705
and Dick was
here with us then.

01:25:35.789 --> 01:25:37.499
They can't be
eight hours adrift.

01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.250
Hey, Dicko?

01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:43.588
Don't you see what this means? You're
in the clear! We can give you an alibi.

01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.674
Yes. Yes,
I suppose you can.

01:25:46.759 --> 01:25:47.717
But there's no supposing.

01:25:47.801 --> 01:25:50.094
Yeah, and we'll simply tell the
police you were here with us.

01:25:50.429 --> 01:25:52.680
Would you do that? Would you
do it now before you go away?

01:25:52.973 --> 01:25:54.432
Of course, old boy.
Delighted.

01:25:54.517 --> 01:25:56.017
You'll do no such thing!

01:25:56.101 --> 01:25:57.143
What?

01:25:57.228 --> 01:26:00.063
Not unless you want to go to
jail for harboring a wanted man.

01:26:00.272 --> 01:26:01.439
But he's
not a criminal.

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:02.649
Well, the police
think he is!

01:26:02.733 --> 01:26:04.317
And they have a lot of
evidence against him.

01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:06.361
Yes, but we know he didn't
kill Miss Milligan.

01:26:06.445 --> 01:26:07.946
We've got to tell them
he was here with us.

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.490
But we don't know he
didn't kill Miss Milligan!

01:26:10.574 --> 01:26:11.824
For all we know
the time given out

01:26:11.909 --> 01:26:13.117
on the radio
might've been a trap.

01:26:13.452 --> 01:26:16.079
But what is certain,
if you go to the police,

01:26:16.163 --> 01:26:19.374
they will probably charge you with
being an accessory after the fact.

01:26:19.458 --> 01:26:21.084
And they certainly
won't allow us to go abroad,

01:26:21.168 --> 01:26:23.336
and they will
probably put us in jail.

01:26:30.844 --> 01:26:35.139
Well, Hetty's right,
damn it.

01:26:35.224 --> 01:26:36.808
I mean, you can see that,
Dicko, can't you?

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:38.309
You mean you won't come
to the police with me?

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:40.687
Well, I don't see how I can.
I mean, you heard Hetty.

01:26:40.771 --> 01:26:41.980
But you're my only alibi!

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:43.064
Well, I'm sorry, old chap.

01:26:43.148 --> 01:26:44.482
You see, I've got to
get to Paris today.

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:45.900
I can't afford
to be kept here.

01:26:45.985 --> 01:26:47.902
But you can afford to stand by
and see me go to jail for life!

01:26:47.987 --> 01:26:48.987
Is that it?

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:50.488
Well, it's not as bad
as all that, old chap.

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:52.365
They'll find this strangler chappie
pretty soon and they'll...

01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:53.908
Of all the cowardly shits!

01:26:54.702 --> 01:26:56.911
It's "I'm all right, Jack, and
haul up the ladder," isn't it?

01:26:56.996 --> 01:26:58.788
You pair of bastards!

01:26:58.872 --> 01:27:00.957
Well, if that's how you feel
after all we've done for you,

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.584
I think you better had go!

01:27:02.668 --> 01:27:04.669
I'll call the manager.

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:06.671
And involve yourself?

01:27:06.755 --> 01:27:08.298
Don't worry, I'm going.

01:27:08.382 --> 01:27:11.593
I'm a little choosy with whom I
spend my last hours of freedom.

01:27:13.012 --> 01:27:14.596
Look, Dick,
I'm sorry about all this.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.640
I'd suggest that you came to
Paris and worked in the pub,

01:27:17.725 --> 01:27:19.225
but they're watching
all the ports and stations.

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:21.019
It said so on the news.

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:23.271
Well, that lets you
out then, doesn't it?

01:27:23.355 --> 01:27:25.440
Your responsibility
for me ends here.

01:27:30.195 --> 01:27:32.238
Clear this area,
please. Thank you, madam.

01:27:32.323 --> 01:27:33.448
Stand back, please.

01:27:36.243 --> 01:27:37.619
Looks as though we've got
half the law in London

01:27:37.703 --> 01:27:38.745
in the market this morning.

01:27:38.829 --> 01:27:42.790
Yeah. It makes it very difficult
to give short weight.

01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:43.958
I suppose they're
trying to find out

01:27:44.043 --> 01:27:47.337
if anybody saw Blaney put in poor,
old Babs on that potato truck.

01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:48.588
You think he did it, do you?

01:27:48.672 --> 01:27:50.089
It stands to reason,
doesn't it?

01:27:50.758 --> 01:27:52.508
Why? Don't you?

01:27:52.593 --> 01:27:54.969
I'm not as eager as some
to turn on my old mates.

01:27:55.054 --> 01:27:57.847
What are you talkin' about?
Blaney wasn't a mate of mine.

01:27:57.931 --> 01:27:59.641
I suppose you know I had
to sack him for stealin'.

01:27:59.725 --> 01:28:00.725
Get off.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.393
Yeah, Blaney was a thief,
right bastard.

01:28:03.103 --> 01:28:04.354
I even told that
Chief Inspector,

01:28:04.438 --> 01:28:06.064
but he didn't
believe a word, did he?

01:28:06.523 --> 01:28:08.483
Well, I expect he's laughing on
the other side of his face now.

01:28:08.567 --> 01:28:09.567
You reckon?

01:28:09.652 --> 01:28:10.902
Yeah, definitely,
definitely.

01:28:11.403 --> 01:28:14.739
He wasn't so cocky when I saw
him at 7:00 this morning.

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:17.659
I've just been down to
Scotland Yard to identify her.

01:28:17.743 --> 01:28:19.911
From photos, you know.
They took 'em, and they...

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:21.954
Rushed 'em down special.

01:28:22.748 --> 01:28:24.582
She wasn't a pretty
sight, I can tell you.

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:26.584
Some people have
all the luck.

01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:28.294
Yeah. I better get
a move on, I suppose.

01:28:28.379 --> 01:28:30.046
Business will be
pretty brisk today.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:31.839
You know how morbid
some people are.

01:28:31.924 --> 01:28:35.259
Absolutely! Jumping up to identify dead
girls at all hours of the morning.

01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:36.761
See you later.

01:28:42.935 --> 01:28:45.144
My God, Dick!

01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:49.816
Whatcha doin' here?

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.527
Look, I'm sorry, Bob,
but I had nowhere else to go.

01:28:52.611 --> 01:28:54.904
The people I was staying with
left for Paris this morning.

01:28:54.988 --> 01:28:56.030
I wouldn't have
come now,

01:28:56.115 --> 01:28:58.533
except that you did say if I
needed anything, anytime...

01:28:58.617 --> 01:28:59.867
Yes, yes, of course!

01:28:59.952 --> 01:29:02.412
But you took a hell of a chance
coming here this morning.

01:29:02.496 --> 01:29:05.415
The whole place is teeming with coppers.
Wait a minute.

01:29:09.962 --> 01:29:12.880
Well, you'd better hole up
in my place for a day or two

01:29:12.965 --> 01:29:14.298
till we get
something sorted.

01:29:14.383 --> 01:29:16.884
Yes. I thought maybe
if you had the room.

01:29:16.969 --> 01:29:18.386
I know it's
a hell of an imposition

01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:19.971
getting you involved
and everything, but...

01:29:20.222 --> 01:29:21.431
Well, you've got
to believe me.

01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:23.683
I haven't murdered anyone!

01:29:23.767 --> 01:29:26.728
This whole business is insane!
I mean, you know me.

01:29:26.979 --> 01:29:28.604
I wouldn't get involved
in anything like this.

01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:31.274
Of course
you wouldn't, Dick. No.

01:29:31.358 --> 01:29:36.028
The police, as usual, have got
the whole thing arse about face.

01:29:36.113 --> 01:29:39.240
I mean, these sort of killings
always boggle the mind.

01:29:39.324 --> 01:29:43.870
That man must be
a sexual maniac.

01:29:43.954 --> 01:29:48.750
Mind you, there are some women
who ask for everything they get.

01:29:48.834 --> 01:29:52.211
But you? Don't make me laugh.
You're not the type.

01:29:52.296 --> 01:29:54.297
Now, don't worry.

01:29:55.174 --> 01:29:58.426
You've done the right thing
coming to your Uncle Bob.

01:29:58.552 --> 01:30:00.136
Right. Well, let's get
over to my place now.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.429
You know where
it is, don't you?

01:30:01.513 --> 01:30:02.597
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:30:02.681 --> 01:30:04.182
I'll go first,
and I'll take the bag.

01:30:04.224 --> 01:30:06.017
- You'll be less conspicuous that way.
- Okay.

01:30:06.101 --> 01:30:07.894
You follow,
but take the long way around.

01:30:07.978 --> 01:30:09.103
Go down to the Strand,
you know.

01:30:09.188 --> 01:30:11.272
And then work your way up
Southampton Street.

01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:13.149
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:36.275 --> 01:31:38.693
Well done, boy! Come in.

01:31:38.777 --> 01:31:41.654
Make yourself comfortable.

01:31:41.738 --> 01:31:43.281
Very cozy.

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:45.283
Yes, well,
it's my little nest.

01:31:45.742 --> 01:31:47.660
You know, my home.

01:31:47.744 --> 01:31:50.454
Home is the place where when you have
to go there, they have to take you in.

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:53.374
That's what my ol' mum used to say.
You met my mum, didn't you?

01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:54.584
Yes.

01:31:54.668 --> 01:31:56.002
Great old lady.

01:31:57.379 --> 01:31:59.839
I better get back to the shop.
See you later, eh?

01:31:59.923 --> 01:32:00.882
Yeah, sure.

01:32:00.966 --> 01:32:02.925
There's something to eat in the kitchen.
The booze is here.

01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:04.802
So get on with it, right?

01:32:05.304 --> 01:32:09.181
Bob, I'm really grateful for all this.
You know that.

01:32:09.641 --> 01:32:11.726
I told you,
think nothing of it.

01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:13.895
Hey, do me a favor,
will you?

01:32:13.979 --> 01:32:16.063
Keep away
from the windows.

01:32:16.148 --> 01:32:17.398
Yes, of course. Sorry.

01:32:17.691 --> 01:32:19.442
Ta-ta.

01:32:19.526 --> 01:32:21.319
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

01:32:53.977 --> 01:32:55.561
Are you
Richard Ian Blaney?

01:32:55.646 --> 01:32:56.771
Yes. What is this?

01:32:56.855 --> 01:32:58.731
You're under arrest. Come
quietly, and you won't get hurt.

01:32:58.815 --> 01:32:59.815
Is this necessary?

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.900
We take no chances
with bastards like you.

01:33:00.984 --> 01:33:02.109
- He's clean, sir.
- Is this your bag?

01:33:02.194 --> 01:33:03.402
- Come on, you.
- Yes.

01:33:20.545 --> 01:33:22.171
Thank you, Mr. Rusk.
You've been very helpful.

01:33:22.255 --> 01:33:24.298
Anything to oblige, Sarge.

01:33:24.383 --> 01:33:26.968
No reward, I'm afraid.
Better luck next time, eh?

01:33:27.052 --> 01:33:30.304
Well, you know what they say,
Sarge, "Virtue is its own reward."

01:33:32.724 --> 01:33:34.433
Well, if you want any more
help, I'll be in my shop.

01:33:34.518 --> 01:33:36.519
All right.
We know where you are.

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:43.734
How's that kid of yours
gettin' on with the violin?

01:33:52.327 --> 01:33:53.911
Richard Ian Blaney?

01:33:54.705 --> 01:33:55.663
Yes.

01:33:55.747 --> 01:33:58.499
As the result of my inquiries,
you'll be detained in connection

01:33:58.583 --> 01:34:01.127
with the willful murders
of Brenda Margaret Blaney,

01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:03.504
Barbara Jane Milligan
and others.

01:34:03.588 --> 01:34:05.756
You're not obliged to say
anything unless you wish.

01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:07.717
But anything you do say will
be taken down in writing

01:34:07.801 --> 01:34:09.635
and may be used
in evidence.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.055
Mr. Oxford, could you
spare a second over here?

01:34:20.272 --> 01:34:22.898
Rusk. It's Rusk!

01:34:22.983 --> 01:34:25.568
Hold him back.
Where was this found?

01:34:25.652 --> 01:34:27.361
Over at Henrietta Street
where we picked him up, sir.

01:34:27.446 --> 01:34:29.488
Any identification?

01:34:33.493 --> 01:34:37.913
"Miss Barbara Milligan, Globe Public House.
Covent Garden, London, WC2."

01:34:47.549 --> 01:34:49.967
Are you agreed
upon your verdict?

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:51.135
We are.

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:53.721
Do you find the prisoner,
Richard Ian Blaney,

01:34:53.805 --> 01:34:56.307
guilty or not guilty of
the murder of Brenda...

01:35:14.367 --> 01:35:15.409
JUDGE:... Ian Blaney,

01:35:15.494 --> 01:35:18.496
you have been found guilty
of a terrible crime.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.041
On its ghastly and wicked
nature I will not dwell.

01:35:22.125 --> 01:35:25.753
I only tell you that you must
entertain no expectation or hope

01:35:25.837 --> 01:35:28.923
that you will escape
the consequences of it.

01:35:29.007 --> 01:35:30.633
The sentence of
this court is that

01:35:30.717 --> 01:35:34.011
you serve a term
of life imprisonment

01:35:34.096 --> 01:35:36.555
for not less
than 25 years...

01:35:41.019 --> 01:35:44.271
Rusk did it!
I told you all along!

01:35:44.356 --> 01:35:45.481
Rusk!

01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:50.402
I keep telling you.
Rusk, where are you?

01:35:50.987 --> 01:35:53.697
One of these days,
you bastard! Rusk...

01:35:54.032 --> 01:35:56.659
Where are you? Rusk?

01:35:56.743 --> 01:35:59.995
One of these days, I'm gonna get
out and kill you, you bastard!

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.914
I've got nothing to lose now!

01:36:01.998 --> 01:36:04.500
I might as well do what
I'm being locked away for!

01:36:04.584 --> 01:36:08.420
You remember that!
You remember that!

01:36:33.947 --> 01:36:35.990
<i>Rusk did it.</i>

01:36:36.992 --> 01:36:40.494
<i>Rusk did it!
I told you all along!</i>

01:36:40.579 --> 01:36:43.581
<i>Rusk? Rusk, where are you?</i>

01:36:43.665 --> 01:36:47.084
<i>One of these days, I'm gonna get
out and kill you, you bastard!</i>

01:36:47.169 --> 01:36:48.794
<i>I've got nothing to lose now!</i>

01:36:48.879 --> 01:36:51.714
<i>I might as well do
what I'm being put away for.</i>

01:36:51.798 --> 01:36:54.758
<i>You remember that!
You remember that!</i>

01:37:07.397 --> 01:37:09.064
- Do you see the sign, Hartletts?
- Yes, sir.

01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:10.441
Well, it's the
fair-haired chap

01:37:10.525 --> 01:37:12.193
in the brown suit standing
right underneath it.

01:37:12.277 --> 01:37:13.903
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I did.

01:37:13.987 --> 01:37:15.946
Right. We'll go around
once again,

01:37:16.031 --> 01:37:18.115
and I want a good,
close mug shot.

01:37:19.075 --> 01:37:20.701
Yes, Inspector,
I remember him well.

01:37:20.785 --> 01:37:22.578
He came here on two
or three occasions.

01:37:23.413 --> 01:37:26.707
Every business has its own special
cross to bear, I suppose.

01:37:26.791 --> 01:37:28.125
And yours is
men like this?

01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:29.543
That is so.

01:37:29.628 --> 01:37:32.004
Most of them are easy enough
to get rid of, but...

01:37:32.088 --> 01:37:34.757
Mr. Robinson here was
particularly insistent.

01:37:34.841 --> 01:37:36.717
He simply wouldn't
take no for an answer.

01:37:36.801 --> 01:37:38.302
Mr. Robinson?

01:37:38.386 --> 01:37:40.804
Yes, that is the man's name.

01:37:47.479 --> 01:37:48.729
Here we are.

01:37:48.813 --> 01:37:50.814
Mr. William Robinson.

01:37:52.275 --> 01:37:53.400
You see, Inspector,

01:37:53.485 --> 01:37:55.778
he wanted us to find women
for him who enjoyed...

01:37:56.988 --> 01:37:59.990
Well, certain peculiarities.

01:38:00.283 --> 01:38:03.577
You mean, who were sexual masochists?
Who enjoyed being hurt?

01:38:03.662 --> 01:38:05.037
That sort of thing?

01:38:05.205 --> 01:38:06.538
Quite.

01:38:06.623 --> 01:38:08.916
Perhaps you'd better
see it for yourself.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.793
Naturally we told him
we couldn't oblige,

01:38:10.877 --> 01:38:12.544
but as I say,
he kept coming back.

01:38:14.256 --> 01:38:15.256
Is it likely, do you think,

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:18.801
that if Mr. Robinson couldn't get
what he wanted from your agency,

01:38:18.885 --> 01:38:20.261
he would go to others?

01:38:20.345 --> 01:38:22.513
Oh, yes, very likely.

01:38:22.597 --> 01:38:24.765
Men like this leave
no stone unturned

01:38:24.849 --> 01:38:27.685
in their search for their
disgusting gratifications.

01:38:32.148 --> 01:38:34.233
Excuse me, Inspector.

01:38:34.317 --> 01:38:37.569
Do you have any special reason
for seeing Mr. Robinson?

01:38:37.946 --> 01:38:40.364
Yes, Miss Barling, we do.

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:42.533
And I'd like you to
keep my visit confidential.

01:38:43.618 --> 01:38:44.785
Of course.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.096
Get the doctor quick.

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.889
It looks like
an ambulance job.

01:39:31.916 --> 01:39:35.210
I told you it wasn't
Blaney, didn't I?

01:39:35.295 --> 01:39:38.339
I told you you were
on the wrong track.

01:39:38.423 --> 01:39:42.426
A woman's intuition is worth more
than all those laboratories.

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:45.596
I can't think why you don't
teach it in police colleges.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.474
So you think it's Rusk, do you?
You think he's our man?

01:39:48.558 --> 01:39:51.352
Well, of course.
Anyone can see that.

01:39:51.436 --> 01:39:56.106
He knew both Mrs. Blaney and that
Barbara what's-her-name, didn't he?

01:39:56.191 --> 01:39:57.232
Yes.

01:39:57.317 --> 01:39:58.609
Well, there you are.

01:39:58.943 --> 01:40:01.362
You told me the man's
a sexual pervert.

01:40:01.446 --> 01:40:04.865
That's why he kept the clothes and
put them in poor Mr. Blaney's case.

01:40:04.949 --> 01:40:07.034
We have no
proof of that.

01:40:07.118 --> 01:40:09.661
It stands to reason.

01:40:09.746 --> 01:40:11.830
Don't you mean intuition?

01:40:12.999 --> 01:40:16.418
What does your intuition tell
you I want for dinner tonight?

01:40:16.503 --> 01:40:19.213
Steak and a baked potato.

01:40:19.297 --> 01:40:25.636
But you're getting
<i>pied de porc à la mode de Caens.</i>

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.221
It looks like
a pig's foot!

01:40:27.305 --> 01:40:28.555
That's what it is.

01:40:28.723 --> 01:40:32.726
I put it in the same sauce
the French use for tripe.

01:40:32.811 --> 01:40:34.603
That's comforting.

01:40:34.687 --> 01:40:36.230
Well...

01:40:36.314 --> 01:40:39.650
When are you going to arrest
this Mr. Robinson, or Rusk,

01:40:39.734 --> 01:40:40.776
or whatever he's called?

01:40:41.152 --> 01:40:42.653
When I have
the proof I need.

01:40:42.737 --> 01:40:46.073
It takes a little longer to
acquire than intuitive insights.

01:40:46.157 --> 01:40:48.325
How much longer?
When will you have it?

01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:50.869
In a few minutes
I hope, dear.

01:40:50.954 --> 01:40:52.996
Really?

01:40:53.081 --> 01:40:55.916
You old slyboots. Tell.

01:40:58.128 --> 01:41:00.254
Well...

01:41:06.052 --> 01:41:09.304
We know that if
Rusk is the murderer,

01:41:09.389 --> 01:41:11.515
he traveled up in the potato
truck with his victim.

01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:14.268
How do we know that?

01:41:14.352 --> 01:41:18.105
Did you ever hear of a corpse that
cut itself out of a tied sack?

01:41:18.565 --> 01:41:22.067
What would he want to take the
corpse out of the sack for?

01:41:22.152 --> 01:41:24.153
Well, obviously, he was
looking for something.

01:41:24.654 --> 01:41:26.864
How do we know that?

01:41:26.948 --> 01:41:29.199
Well, the corpse was
deep in rigor mortis.

01:41:29.284 --> 01:41:32.870
He had to break the fingers of the
right hand to retrieve what they held.

01:41:37.167 --> 01:41:40.127
You know, it would be so nice to get
back to plain bread in this house.

01:41:40.587 --> 01:41:42.129
What do you think they held?

01:41:42.213 --> 01:41:46.049
A locket? A broach? A cross!

01:41:46.551 --> 01:41:49.303
It had to be something
that would incriminate him.

01:41:49.387 --> 01:41:52.639
Something that he missed when
he put the body on the truck.

01:41:52.724 --> 01:41:54.975
A monogrammed
handkerchief, perhaps.

01:41:55.059 --> 01:41:57.144
Not a cross, I think.

01:41:57.228 --> 01:41:59.980
Well...

01:42:00.064 --> 01:42:02.441
I don't see why not.

01:42:02.525 --> 01:42:05.903
Religious and sexual mania
are closely linked.

01:42:09.032 --> 01:42:12.451
Anyway, whatever it
was, he found it,

01:42:12.535 --> 01:42:15.245
which was unlucky for us.

01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:18.081
But we did have one
piece of good fortune.

01:42:19.417 --> 01:42:23.462
The truck driver told us that he
stopped at one place on his journey,

01:42:24.255 --> 01:42:27.758
and that was at a pull-in
somewhere out of London.

01:42:27.842 --> 01:42:30.177
- A pull-in?
- Mmm.

01:42:30.261 --> 01:42:35.390
It's a cafe frequented
by truck drivers, dear.

01:42:35.475 --> 01:42:39.102
They serve humble foods like
bacon and egg sandwiches,

01:42:39.187 --> 01:42:43.482
sausages and mashed potatoes
and cups of tea and coffee.

01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:47.861
How is it so fortunate that
this driver stopped there?

01:42:49.572 --> 01:42:51.365
Well, it's not so much
that he stopped,

01:42:51.449 --> 01:42:54.034
but that he stopped
only once that is important.

01:42:54.994 --> 01:42:56.995
The only place our man
could've escaped

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.539
from that truck
was at that cafe.

01:42:58.623 --> 01:43:00.541
I sent Sergeant Spearman
out there earlier today

01:43:00.625 --> 01:43:03.293
to see if he could find anyone who
could remember Rusk being there.

01:43:03.545 --> 01:43:05.921
I'm expecting him
back at any minute.

01:43:06.005 --> 01:43:09.550
Well, eat up, dear. You'll want to
be finished by the time he arrives.

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:13.220
Tasty, very tasty.

01:43:13.304 --> 01:43:15.973
Not a lot of
meat on it, mind.

01:43:16.057 --> 01:43:17.766
No sense in gorging, dear.

01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:19.560
I'll take mine
and eat it

01:43:19.644 --> 01:43:21.853
while I'm beating my
egg whites for the soufflé.

01:43:28.027 --> 01:43:29.570
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Good evening, sir.

01:43:29.654 --> 01:43:31.071
I hope I'm not
interrupting your dinner.

01:43:31.155 --> 01:43:32.239
No, not at all.
Come in.

01:43:32.323 --> 01:43:33.323
Thank you, sir.

01:43:33.992 --> 01:43:35.117
Put your hat and
coat on the sofa.

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:41.707
Good evening, Sergeant Spearman.
What would you like to drink?

01:43:41.791 --> 01:43:44.167
Good evening, madam.
Well, I don't know that I...

01:43:44.252 --> 01:43:46.336
Oh, that's all right, Spearman.
You're off duty, now.

01:43:46.421 --> 01:43:49.423
How about a margarita?

01:43:49.507 --> 01:43:50.632
It's delicious.

01:43:50.717 --> 01:43:52.843
Tequila, triple sec,

01:43:53.136 --> 01:43:58.599
fresh lemon juice and salt pressed
'round the rim of the glass.

01:43:58.683 --> 01:43:59.850
You'll love it.

01:43:59.976 --> 01:44:01.143
Thank you, madam.

01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:06.732
Sergeant Spearman,
you are positively

01:44:06.816 --> 01:44:08.567
glutinous with
self-approbation.

01:44:08.651 --> 01:44:09.776
You might as well speak out.

01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:10.944
Yes, sir.

01:44:11.029 --> 01:44:12.946
The woman behind
the counter at the cafe

01:44:13.031 --> 01:44:16.199
positively identified Rusk
from the photo I showed her

01:44:16.284 --> 01:44:17.784
as being a man who
called at the café

01:44:17.869 --> 01:44:19.494
the night the body
was discovered.

01:44:19.704 --> 01:44:21.413
And that's not all.

01:44:21.497 --> 01:44:23.957
What are you waiting for, Sergeant?
A roll of drums?

01:44:24.042 --> 01:44:25.751
No, sir. Sorry, sir.

01:44:25.835 --> 01:44:29.296
The woman also said that Rusk
was disheveled and very dusty

01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.715
and asked to borrow
a clothes brush.

01:44:40.266 --> 01:44:42.643
This is the brush
she lent him, sir.

01:44:42.727 --> 01:44:44.311
You see there?

01:44:47.065 --> 01:44:50.776
What do you say, Spearman?
Potato dust?

01:44:51.861 --> 01:44:54.237
Here you are, Sergeant.

01:44:55.323 --> 01:44:57.240
Cheers.

01:44:57.325 --> 01:44:58.492
Cheers, madam.

01:44:58.951 --> 01:45:00.494
Did you hear all that?

01:45:00.578 --> 01:45:03.080
Yes, I told you.
I knew all the time.

01:45:03.539 --> 01:45:04.831
Quite.

01:45:04.916 --> 01:45:06.792
Get this down to the lab
as soon as possible, will you?

01:45:06.876 --> 01:45:08.251
Very good, sir.

01:45:09.754 --> 01:45:12.673
It rather looks like we put
the wrong man away this time.

01:45:12.757 --> 01:45:16.593
What do you mean "we"?
You put him away.

01:45:16.844 --> 01:45:18.095
All right, Spearman,
you can get along now.

01:45:18.262 --> 01:45:19.513
Good night, madam.

01:45:19.597 --> 01:45:21.098
You haven't
finished your drink.

01:45:21.182 --> 01:45:24.685
I'm sorry, madam. I have to get
down to the lab in a hurry.

01:45:24.769 --> 01:45:27.396
Good night, Spearman.
Good work. Very good work.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.314
Thank you, sir.

01:45:34.696 --> 01:45:36.446
Poor Mr. Blaney.

01:45:36.531 --> 01:45:39.616
You've got to get him out,
Tim, immediately.

01:45:39.701 --> 01:45:41.868
He's in hospital
at the moment.

01:45:41.953 --> 01:45:44.037
But I'll talk to the assistant
commissioner in the morning

01:45:44.122 --> 01:45:46.123
and get the case
reopened.

01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:49.376
He won't like it, but there's quite
enough evidence for a pardon.

01:45:49.961 --> 01:45:51.586
Will they give him
any compensation?

01:45:52.463 --> 01:45:53.839
I expect they'll
give him some money,

01:45:53.923 --> 01:45:56.883
but there's no real way to
compensate in cases like these.

01:45:58.052 --> 01:45:59.469
Poor man.

01:46:01.723 --> 01:46:06.226
I think the least you can do is ask
him 'round for a really good dinner.

01:46:07.145 --> 01:46:08.520
Let's see.

01:46:08.604 --> 01:46:11.815
It will obviously have
to be something substantial.

01:46:12.525 --> 01:46:17.738
I think
a Caneton aux cerises.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.740
What's that?

01:46:19.824 --> 01:46:20.907
Duckling...

01:46:20.992 --> 01:46:23.994
With heavy sweet cherry sauce.

01:46:25.663 --> 01:46:27.414
Well, after that jail
food he's been having,

01:46:27.498 --> 01:46:28.749
I expect
he'll eat anything.

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:38.258
Excuse me.

01:46:38.342 --> 01:46:41.261
I must see if my soufflé's
started to rise.

01:47:09.957 --> 01:47:11.875
Hey!

01:47:11.959 --> 01:47:13.919
Are the pills working?

01:47:22.136 --> 01:47:23.845
He's sleeping like a baby.

01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:25.764
Do you think
we gave him enough?

01:47:25.973 --> 01:47:28.558
Christ, mate,
he's had half a dozen.

01:47:29.185 --> 01:47:31.853
Good. Now I'm off to
get that bastard, Rusk!

01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:33.939
All right, all right.
Let's make sure.

01:47:34.398 --> 01:47:37.317
It's now or never! I'm due
back inside tomorrow.

01:47:37.902 --> 01:47:39.236
George? George!

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.695
All right, George.

01:48:08.683 --> 01:48:12.018
Right, son, better be going.
Mind you, do him up good.

01:48:12.103 --> 01:48:14.145
Here, take this
strip of mica.

01:48:14.230 --> 01:48:16.940
You may need it to open his door.
It might be locked.

01:48:35.459 --> 01:48:38.128
Doctor? Sister?

01:48:50.474 --> 01:48:52.225
Get a trolley, nurse.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.567
Well, Sister,
there seems to be

01:49:00.651 --> 01:49:02.903
no evidence of
a cerebral accident.

01:49:02.987 --> 01:49:05.655
We'll have to admit him for
observation and then sort it out.

01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.991
Could he be an
epileptic or a diabetic?

01:49:08.075 --> 01:49:10.160
Not very likely
in his sort of job.

01:49:10.244 --> 01:49:12.078
We're certainly going
to need blood samples.

01:49:20.796 --> 01:49:24.466
Sleeping pills! They've given
him all their sleeping pills.

01:49:33.351 --> 01:49:35.268
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

01:50:57.601 --> 01:50:59.853
Hello?

01:50:59.937 --> 01:51:02.355
Good God! When was this?

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.733
Right. What's that?

01:51:04.817 --> 01:51:08.361
Yes. Five minutes.
I'll wait outside.

01:51:08.446 --> 01:51:11.656
I'm off! Blaney's escaped, and
I bet I know where he's gone.

01:51:14.827 --> 01:51:17.579
I often wondered whether Blaney
threw himself down those stairs

01:51:17.663 --> 01:51:21.041
in a suicide attempt or just as a
means to get into the hospital.

01:51:21.125 --> 01:51:23.168
And now, of course,
we have our answer.

01:54:17.092 --> 01:54:19.552
No. No! It's not...

01:54:52.044 --> 01:54:54.087
Mr. Rusk.

01:54:55.256 --> 01:54:57.507
You're not
wearing your tie.

01:54:58.968 --> 01:55:00.593
I...
