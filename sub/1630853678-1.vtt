WEBVTT

00:05.540 --> 00:09.083
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

00:10.647 --> 00:14.253
<i>I'll dry the tears</i>
<i>from your eyes</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:20.292
<i>Let's don't let</i>
<i>a good thing die</i>

00:36.244 --> 00:38.838
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

00:39.815 --> 00:42.706
<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

00:42.842 --> 00:47.513
<i>He'll take you by the hand</i>

00:47.649 --> 00:50.250
<i>He'll say one, two, three</i>

00:51.750 --> 00:53.820
<i>And you will be...</i>

00:54.864 --> 00:59.926
<i>In cotton candy land</i>

01:00.061 --> 01:02.032
<i> For those of you</i>
<i>who are wondering,</i>

01:02.168 --> 01:05.272
<i>who this fella here is,</i>

01:05.407 --> 01:10.903
<i>I am the legendary</i>
<i>Colonel Tom Parker.</i>

01:23.550 --> 01:25.624
<i>Colonel Tom Parker,</i>
<i>legendary manager</i>

01:25.760 --> 01:29.629
<i>of Elvis Presley, has been</i>
<i>rushed to Valley Hospital.</i>

01:29.764 --> 01:34.227
<i> I am the man who</i>
<i>gave the world Elvis Presley.</i>

01:36.604 --> 01:42.171
<i>Without me, there would be</i>
<i>no Elvis Presley.</i>

01:42.307 --> 01:44.101
<i>And yet, there are some</i>

01:44.237 --> 01:47.572
<i>who'd make me out</i>
<i>to be the villain</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:49.348
<i>of this here story.</i>

02:04.461 --> 02:09.029
<i>Colonel Tom Parker</i>
<i>was a liar, a cheat, a con man.</i>

02:09.165 --> 02:12.503
<i>A shocking new book</i>
<i>accuses Colonel Tom Parker</i>

02:12.639 --> 02:15.132
<i>of massive fraud</i>
<i>and mis-management.</i>

02:17.842 --> 02:21.674
Parker received as much
as 50% of Elvis' income.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.548
<i>He worked Elvis like a mule,</i>

02:23.683 --> 02:25.442
<i>to support his own</i>
<i>gambling addiction.</i>

02:25.578 --> 02:27.220
<i> The court finds</i>
<i>that the compensation received</i>

02:27.355 --> 02:29.289
<i>by Colonel Parker</i>
<i>was excessive,</i>

02:29.425 --> 02:31.118
<i>and shocked the conscience</i>
<i>of the court.</i>

02:31.253 --> 02:32.888
<i> Many believe</i>
<i>that Colonel Tom Parker</i>

02:33.024 --> 02:35.856
<i>was responsible for the death</i>
<i>of Elvis Presley.</i>

02:37.627 --> 02:39.156
Now, you listen to me.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.331
The only thing that matters
is that that man

02:42.467 --> 02:44.832
gets up on that stage tonight.

03:34.716 --> 03:41.625
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

03:42.790 --> 03:49.732
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

03:53.867 --> 04:00.776
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

04:07.348 --> 04:10.252
<i>Tom Parker killed him!</i>

04:10.388 --> 04:13.452
No! That's not true.

04:26.273 --> 04:30.608
No, no, I didn't kill him.

04:33.279 --> 04:35.514
I made Elvis Presley.

04:38.151 --> 04:41.648
<i>Nothing all those muckrakers</i>
<i>said in their books was true.</i>

04:41.784 --> 04:44.249
Me and Elvis, we was partners.

04:44.384 --> 04:50.288
It was Elvis the Showman
and the Colonel the Snowman.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.192
<i>This is the lying Dutchman.</i>

04:52.328 --> 04:55.458
<i> I always knew I was</i>
<i>destined for greatness.</i>

04:55.594 --> 04:58.329
<i>As an orphan,</i>
<i>I ran away to the carnival,</i>

04:58.464 --> 05:01.368
<i>where I learned the art</i>
<i>of the "snow job,"</i>

05:01.503 --> 05:04.576
<i>of emptying a rube's wallet</i>
<i>while leaving them with nothing</i>

05:04.712 --> 05:07.205
<i>-but a smile on their face.</i>

05:07.341 --> 05:09.048
<i>But a carnival act</i>
<i>that would get you</i>

05:09.184 --> 05:11.749
<i>the most money, the most snow,</i>

05:11.884 --> 05:15.319
<i>had great costumes</i>
<i>and a unique trick,</i>

05:15.454 --> 05:17.248
<i>that gave the audience feelings</i>

05:17.384 --> 05:20.652
<i>they weren't sure</i>
<i>they should enjoy.</i>

05:20.787 --> 05:22.727
<i>But they do.</i>

05:22.862 --> 05:27.924
<i>And I knew if I could</i>
<i>find such an act,</i>

05:28.060 --> 05:31.903
<i>I could create the greatest...</i>

05:32.039 --> 05:33.367
<i>show...</i>

05:33.502 --> 05:34.507
<i>on...</i>

05:35.404 --> 05:38.042
<i>earth.</i>

05:38.177 --> 05:41.511
<i>After the carnival, I moved</i>
<i>into the music business...</i>

05:41.646 --> 05:44.246
<i>the country music business.</i>

05:44.381 --> 05:48.718
<i>I partnered with one of its</i>
<i>biggest stars, Hank Snow.</i>

05:48.853 --> 05:54.390
<i>Pardon me</i>
<i>if I'm sentimental</i>

05:54.526 --> 05:56.828
<i>When we say goodbye</i>

05:56.964 --> 06:01.198
<i> And his hapless son,</i>
<i>Jimmie Rodgers Snow.</i>

06:01.334 --> 06:02.267
Hot-diggity-dog, Billy.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.504
-I got one.
-Oh, yeah.

06:04.639 --> 06:07.239
Can't believe it.
Blow their socks off.

06:07.374 --> 06:09.600
Security. Security, Diskin!

06:09.735 --> 06:12.507
Tell the mayors of these towns
that we need a police escort

06:12.643 --> 06:14.207
for Hank when he arrives.

06:14.342 --> 06:17.349
In Baton Rouge, we are going
to have a carny wedding

06:17.484 --> 06:18.946
at the top of the Ferris Wheel,

06:19.081 --> 06:21.214
so, Zina, pick out
your next husband.

06:21.349 --> 06:23.753
In New Orleans, we're gonna
use the loudspeaker

06:23.889 --> 06:25.783
-to announce you, Hank.
-Oh, sure.

06:28.424 --> 06:29.622
...you are going to march
in the parade.

06:31.226 --> 06:33.091
Am I gonna be riding
on an elephant, too?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.264
A man on an elephant
looks important.

06:35.399 --> 06:36.600
And taller.

06:36.736 --> 06:38.065
We still need to get
a novelty act

06:38.200 --> 06:40.138
-to bring in the young folk.
-Well, yes, yes,

06:40.273 --> 06:42.939
that's why you have
a meeting with
the Duke of Paducah tonight.

06:43.074 --> 06:45.270
If we can book "the Funniest
Mouth in the South,"

06:45.405 --> 06:46.643
we'll have the greatest show
of the season.

06:46.779 --> 06:47.871
Hey, Jimmie,
turn that record off.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.506
Y'all have to hear this.

06:49.641 --> 06:51.408
Kids all over town
are playing it everywhere I go.

06:59.227 --> 07:00.654
I hear Negro rhythms.

07:00.790 --> 07:02.463
But with a country flavor.

07:02.598 --> 07:04.923
Sun Records?
That's Sam Phillips' label.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.656
Oh, yeah, Phillips.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.535
He makes all those race records
with the colored singers.

07:09.671 --> 07:11.435
Well, this fella's
on the Hayride tonight,

07:11.571 --> 07:13.005
after me in the newcomer spot.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.664
In Shreveport?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.309
No, they are not putting
a colored boy on the Hayride.

07:17.445 --> 07:20.514
That's the thing. He's white.

07:21.147 --> 07:22.582
He's...

07:24.679 --> 07:26.147
He's white?

07:26.282 --> 07:27.653
<i> What do you think,</i>
<i>Texarkana?</i>

07:27.788 --> 07:29.514
<i>Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

07:29.649 --> 07:31.257
<i>Well, that's all right,</i>
<i>mama</i>

07:31.392 --> 07:32.957
<i>That's all right for you</i>

07:33.092 --> 07:34.761
<i> Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

07:34.897 --> 07:37.629
<i>Everybody's talkin' 'bout</i>
<i>this new Presley kid</i>

07:37.764 --> 07:39.965
<i>That's all right...</i>

07:40.100 --> 07:44.395
<i> That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right...</i>

07:47.636 --> 07:49.136
He's white?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.880
<i> But it don't matter</i>
<i>if you do ten stupid things,</i>

07:58.015 --> 08:00.917
<i>as long as you do</i>
<i>one smart one.</i>

08:05.786 --> 08:08.487
<i> Welcome y'all</i>
<i>to the Louisiana Hayride,</i>

08:08.623 --> 08:12.693
<i>broadcasting live</i>
<i>to 26 of these United States.</i>

08:12.829 --> 08:15.333
<i>How do you think I feel</i>

08:16.570 --> 08:20.102
<i>I know your love's not real</i>

08:20.237 --> 08:23.209
Well, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

08:23.344 --> 08:24.910
Where is the Colonel?

08:25.046 --> 08:28.076
You have the fella that's
singing the "All Right, Mama,"

08:28.212 --> 08:30.682
that new record that's
on the Sun label, eh?

08:30.818 --> 08:32.712
-The pop jocks
keep playing him.
-Yeah.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.347
Country DJs, too.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.889
Even the colored kids,
they're buyin' his record.

08:37.025 --> 08:40.687
The colored ki-- Well, where
would I find such an act?

08:40.822 --> 08:42.189
The dressing room.

08:45.701 --> 08:48.498
-Oh. Howdy.
-Hey, Elvis Presley?

08:48.634 --> 08:49.599
-Blue Moon Boys?
-Yeah.

08:49.735 --> 08:51.231
-You're up next.
-Oh, sh--

08:53.540 --> 08:54.999
Excuse me. Bill, go time!

08:55.134 --> 08:57.235
I know, I know.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.807
-Hi!
-How's his stomach?

08:58.942 --> 09:00.306
I thought I'd grab him a Pepsi,

09:00.441 --> 09:02.341
but poor thing's still shaking
like a leaf.

09:02.477 --> 09:05.080
I'll get him on the stage.
Come on. Let's go.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.881
-Here.

09:09.017 --> 09:10.349
It'll settle your stomach.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.189
What if I forget
the words on live radio?

09:12.324 --> 09:14.586
All we gotta do out there's
just a bit of clownin' around.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.288
That's how we got this thing
started in the first place.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.059
Scotty and Bill are right,
Elvis.

09:19.195 --> 09:20.634
You're not out there
on your own.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.429
-You boys are a band.
-That's right.

09:22.565 --> 09:24.093
The Lord gave us music
to bring people together.

09:24.229 --> 09:25.704
We're like a family,

09:25.840 --> 09:27.601
and family is the most
important thing of all.

09:27.737 --> 09:29.303
Amen.

09:29.438 --> 09:33.041
Come on now, Booby.
Jesse's shining bright tonight.

09:33.176 --> 09:35.777
Shining down his strength
upon you.

09:40.788 --> 09:46.092
<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>

09:46.227 --> 09:50.964
<i> Jesse, Elvis's twin</i>
<i>brother, who died at birth.</i>

09:51.100 --> 09:52.756
<i>Tragic.</i>

09:52.892 --> 09:54.960
<i> Vernon, come quick!</i>
<i>It's another child!</i>

09:55.096 --> 09:58.467
<i> My darling,</i>
<i>you'll have</i>
<i>the strength of two men.</i>

09:58.602 --> 10:01.201
<i> But when</i>
<i>my boy's daddy</i>
<i>passed a bad check</i>

10:01.337 --> 10:02.539
<i>and got carted off</i>
<i>to prison...</i>

10:04.608 --> 10:06.142
<i>...the boy and his mama had</i>
<i>to take one of the houses</i>

10:06.278 --> 10:08.505
<i>for white folks</i>
<i>in a colored neighborhood.</i>

10:08.641 --> 10:10.113
<i>New boy! Come over!</i>

10:10.248 --> 10:12.142
<i> But that boy</i>
<i>had a big imagination.</i>

10:13.879 --> 10:15.515
<i> He really believed</i>
<i>he was the hero</i>

10:15.650 --> 10:17.519
<i>-in one of them comic books.</i>

10:17.655 --> 10:20.254
<i> He was going to bust</i>
<i>his daddy out of the hoosegow</i>

10:20.390 --> 10:24.193
<i>and fly him</i>
<i>to the Rock of Eternity!</i>

10:24.328 --> 10:26.856
Then he buys
his mama a pink Cadillac.

10:26.992 --> 10:29.169
Pink Cadillac?
What are you talking about?

10:29.304 --> 10:31.029
Hey, fools! Whoo!

10:31.164 --> 10:35.940
<i> Ohh</i>

10:36.075 --> 10:39.069
<i>Black snake</i>
<i>crawlin' in my room</i>

10:39.205 --> 10:41.081
Come on, Doc, let's go.

10:41.216 --> 10:44.678
<i> Them comic book heroes</i>
<i>all have them super powers.</i>

10:44.814 --> 10:48.383
<i>His was music.</i>

10:48.518 --> 10:56.663
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

10:56.798 --> 11:03.660
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

11:05.469 --> 11:12.240
<i>Ohh...</i>
<i>Black snake crawlin'</i>
<i>in my room</i>

11:12.375 --> 11:14.847
Move, man. Hey, it's my turn.

11:24.349 --> 11:27.387
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

11:32.390 --> 11:35.098
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

11:51.249 --> 11:55.783
<i> Oh, I'll fly away</i>
<i>Oh, Glory</i>

11:55.918 --> 11:58.554
<i>I'll fly away</i>

11:58.690 --> 11:59.991
<i>When I die</i>

12:00.126 --> 12:04.024
<i>When I die</i>
<i>Hallelujah, by and by</i>

12:04.160 --> 12:05.227
What you doin'?

12:07.699 --> 12:09.133
<i>I'll fly away</i>

12:09.268 --> 12:10.528
<i>-No more preachin', no more</i>
<i>-I'll fly away</i>

12:10.663 --> 12:13.430
<i>-No more pain, no more</i>
<i>-I'll fly away</i>

12:13.565 --> 12:14.973
<i>I'll fly away</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:16.134
<i>No more preachin', I'll fly</i>

12:16.269 --> 12:17.402
<i>No more pain, I'll fly</i>

12:17.537 --> 12:18.876
<i>I'll fly away</i>

12:19.012 --> 12:20.605
Hey, fool, come back.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.916
No. He's with the spirit!

12:24.847 --> 12:25.977
It's all right.

12:30.886 --> 12:33.959
<i>Ohh</i>

12:34.094 --> 12:36.790
<i>Black snake</i>
<i>crawlin' in my room</i>

12:36.926 --> 12:38.526
Whoo!

12:38.661 --> 12:42.569
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

12:42.704 --> 12:44.470
<i> That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>Anyway you choose</i>

12:46.601 --> 12:50.409
<i>I'll fly away, oh, Glory</i>

12:50.544 --> 12:53.543
<i>I'll fly away</i>

12:53.678 --> 12:55.644
<i>Oh, away</i>

12:55.780 --> 12:58.279
<i>-Black snake crawling</i>
<i>in my room</i>
<i>-Hallelujah, by and by</i>

12:58.414 --> 13:01.611
<i>-Ohhh</i>
-<i> I'll fly away</i>

13:01.747 --> 13:04.022
Elvis. Come on,
you gotta get on in.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.281
They've already announced you
on the radio.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.952
Folks are real excited.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.657
<i> At Sun Records,</i>
<i>Sam Phillips was on a mission</i>

13:10.792 --> 13:13.961
<i>to save the world</i>
<i>by recording Black music.</i>

13:14.097 --> 13:16.161
<i>But it didn't sell.</i>

13:16.297 --> 13:17.829
<i>So to pay his bills,</i>

13:17.965 --> 13:21.501
<i>he needed to find a new singer</i>
<i>for his country act.</i>

13:21.636 --> 13:24.401
I don't know what it is
you see in this boy.

13:24.536 --> 13:26.979
I just think he's different.

13:31.314 --> 13:34.085
How do you know
"Big Boy" Crudup?

13:36.587 --> 13:40.255
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right for you</i>

13:40.390 --> 13:43.864
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

13:43.999 --> 13:47.725
<i>That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

13:47.861 --> 13:52.628
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

13:56.671 --> 13:58.871
He's a young singer
from Memphis, Tennessee.

13:59.007 --> 14:03.445
Got a song out
on the Sun label.
It's all over the radio.

14:03.580 --> 14:07.987
Give him a warm Hayride welcome
to a Mr. Elvis Presley.

14:27.272 --> 14:29.266
Elvis,
how are you this evening?

14:29.402 --> 14:30.910
Just fine, how you, sir?

14:31.046 --> 14:35.608
<i> Greasy hair,</i>
<i>girly makeup.</i>

14:35.744 --> 14:38.910
<i>I cannot overstate</i>
<i>how strange he looked.</i>

14:39.046 --> 14:41.054
Are you all geared up
with your band there to...

14:41.189 --> 14:43.322
-I'm all geared up.
-...let us hear your songs?

14:43.457 --> 14:46.056
Uh... well, I'd like to say how
happy we are to be down here.

14:46.191 --> 14:48.027
It's a real honor
for us to be...

14:48.163 --> 14:50.229
Get a chance to appear
on the Louisiana Hayride.

14:50.365 --> 14:52.793
We're gonna do a song for you
we got out on Sun Records.

14:52.928 --> 14:55.362
Uh...

14:55.498 --> 14:56.732
You got anything else
to say, sir?

14:56.868 --> 14:59.005
No. I'm ready.

15:04.776 --> 15:06.646
It goes...

15:06.781 --> 15:08.542
It goes something like this.

15:12.587 --> 15:13.618
<i>Oh, baby, baby,</i>

15:13.754 --> 15:16.049
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

15:16.185 --> 15:18.084
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

15:19.386 --> 15:21.489
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

15:22.554 --> 15:23.826
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

15:25.596 --> 15:28.529
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

15:29.429 --> 15:31.063
Get a haircut, fairy!

15:36.608 --> 15:39.178
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i>in a flash of lightning,</i>

15:39.314 --> 15:41.979
<i>I watched that skinny boy</i>
<i>in the pink suit</i>

15:42.114 --> 15:46.010
<i>transform into a superhero.</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:51.481
<i>Well, you may go to college</i>
<i>You may go to school</i>

15:51.616 --> 15:55.094
<i>You may have a pink Cadillac</i>
<i>But don't you be</i>
<i>nobody's fool</i>

15:55.229 --> 15:57.927
<i>Now, baby</i>
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

15:58.063 --> 15:59.792
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

15:59.927 --> 16:03.993
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:06.034
<i>Well, listen and</i>
<i>I'll tell you, baby</i>

16:06.169 --> 16:07.572
<i>What I'm talking about</i>

16:09.976 --> 16:12.302
<i>Come on back to me,</i>
<i>little girl</i>
<i>So we can play some house</i>

16:13.574 --> 16:15.010
<i>Baby, come back, baby, come</i>

16:15.146 --> 16:16.339
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

16:18.110 --> 16:19.619
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

16:19.754 --> 16:21.879
<i>Wanna play house!</i>

16:22.014 --> 16:24.314
-What are they hollerin' at?
-The wiggle!

16:24.449 --> 16:25.617
The what?

16:25.753 --> 16:26.822
Them girls
wanna see you wiggle.

16:26.957 --> 16:27.991
Move, man!

16:28.127 --> 16:30.021
-Do more!
-Much more!

16:30.157 --> 16:31.189
Man!

16:31.324 --> 16:32.664
Do it again.

16:34.634 --> 16:38.864
<i>Well, this is one thing, baby</i>
<i>That I want you to know</i>

16:38.999 --> 16:40.732
<i>Come on back</i>
<i>Let's play a little house</i>

16:40.867 --> 16:42.167
<i>And we can do</i>
<i>what we did before</i>

16:42.303 --> 16:43.168
<i>Now, baby</i>

16:43.303 --> 16:44.171
Sit down!

16:44.307 --> 16:45.672
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

16:45.807 --> 16:48.178
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>
<i>Come back, baby</i>

16:48.314 --> 16:49.876
What in God's sweet name
am I looking at?

16:50.012 --> 16:51.007
Hit it!

17:21.081 --> 17:22.709
What were you thinking,
Jimmie?

17:25.118 --> 17:26.317
I don't know what I'm thinking.

17:28.421 --> 17:31.551
Please, Lord,
don't let 'em hurt my baby.

17:31.686 --> 17:33.753
Hurt him?
Looks like they wanna--

17:37.059 --> 17:41.257
<i>Baby, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>baby</i>

17:41.393 --> 17:44.902
<i> Now, I don't</i>
<i>know nothin' about music...</i>

17:46.803 --> 17:50.074
<i>...but I could see</i>
<i>in that girl's eyes,</i>

17:50.209 --> 17:51.935
<i>that she was having feelings</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:54.908
<i>she wasn't sure</i>
<i>she should enjoy.</i>

17:55.043 --> 17:57.980
<i>Black snake crawlin' in my room</i>

17:58.115 --> 17:59.647
<i> Yes.</i>

18:02.719 --> 18:06.390
<i>He was a taste</i>
<i>of forbidden fruit.</i>

18:07.754 --> 18:11.296
<i>She could've eaten him alive.</i>

18:25.773 --> 18:29.140
Why are you trying
to kill my son?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.210
<i> It was the greatest</i>
<i>carnival attraction</i>

18:31.346 --> 18:33.181
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

18:33.316 --> 18:35.814
<i>He was my destiny.</i>

18:35.950 --> 18:40.622
<i>Right under my nose...</i>
<i>In Memphis.</i>

18:43.091 --> 18:44.694
<i> Top of the morning</i>
<i>to you, friends,</i>

18:44.829 --> 18:46.993
<i>from the home of colorful,</i>
<i>old Beale Street.</i>

18:47.129 --> 18:50.295
<i>The place where the blues began</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

18:50.430 --> 18:52.701
<i>Where you see pretty browns</i>
<i>dressed in beautiful gowns,</i>

18:52.836 --> 18:55.441
<i>along with tailor-mades</i>
<i>and hand-me-downs.</i>

18:55.577 --> 18:58.005
<i>Where you see honest men</i>
<i>and pickpockets skilled,</i>

18:58.141 --> 19:00.747
<i>and business never closes</i>
<i>till somebody gets killed.</i>

19:00.882 --> 19:02.647
<i>Now, just kidding.</i>

19:02.783 --> 19:05.076
<i>But there's a lot goin' down</i>
<i>on Beale Street tonight,</i>

19:05.211 --> 19:07.343
<i>and nowhere more-so</i>
<i>than at the Club Handy.</i>

19:07.479 --> 19:09.219
<i>Come around if you wanna see</i>
<i>Big Mama Thornton,</i>

19:09.354 --> 19:11.816
<i>layin' down her newest hit.</i>

19:11.952 --> 19:13.024
<i>Get it, get it</i>

19:13.160 --> 19:14.023
Get it! Come on!

19:14.158 --> 19:15.991
<i>Oh, let's do it</i>

19:16.126 --> 19:19.430
<i> Now, listen up,</i>
<i>while Brown America speaks.</i>

19:19.565 --> 19:23.960
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

19:24.096 --> 19:25.568
<i>Quit snoopin'</i>
<i>'round my door</i>

19:34.376 --> 19:38.880
<i> Just why</i>
<i>a truck driver</i>
<i>from Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

19:39.016 --> 19:42.646
<i>liked to hang out</i>
<i>on Beale Street, I do not know.</i>

19:42.782 --> 19:46.455
<i>You told me</i>
<i>you was high class</i>
<i>But I could see through that...</i>

19:46.591 --> 19:48.856
<i>But it did him no favors,</i>

19:48.991 --> 19:52.755
<i>fitting into them</i>
<i>white housing projects.</i>

19:52.891 --> 19:55.668
Hey, squirrel. Nice shoes.

19:55.803 --> 20:02.308
<i>And, Daddy, I know</i>
<i>That you ain't</i>
<i>no real cool cat</i>

20:03.173 --> 20:04.702
Hey, Elvis!

20:11.843 --> 20:13.620
<i> Hey, Tommy.</i>

20:13.755 --> 20:15.585
<i>That's that boy whose record</i>
<i>everybody's talkin' about.</i>

20:22.397 --> 20:24.726
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

20:43.246 --> 20:47.619
<i> Hey, sideburns.</i>
<i>Where's the Negro suit today?</i>

20:47.755 --> 20:52.188
<i> He was crazy</i>
<i>for that Beale Street music.</i>

20:52.324 --> 20:54.988
<i>Beale Street style.</i>

20:55.123 --> 20:58.393
<i>He had Beale Street stars</i>
<i>in his eyes.</i>

20:58.529 --> 21:00.392
What do you think, Tony? Huh?

21:00.527 --> 21:02.161
B.B. King.

21:02.296 --> 21:06.801
<i>No, I didn't take my boy away</i>
<i>from nothin'.</i>

21:06.937 --> 21:10.409
<i>He was runnin'</i>
<i>from the day he was born.</i>

21:10.544 --> 21:14.978
<i>I just opened the door</i>
<i>to our destiny.</i>

21:15.114 --> 21:17.976
<i> So without so much as</i>
<i>a word to your daddy and me,</i>

21:18.112 --> 21:19.650
<i>you quit your job</i>
<i>to go traveling</i>

21:19.786 --> 21:22.020
<i>all the way to Florida</i>
<i>with this Colonel fellow</i>

21:22.156 --> 21:23.879
<i>that we have never met.</i>

21:24.015 --> 21:25.388
Mama, it's only four days.

21:25.523 --> 21:27.988
Yeah, four days.
And then what?

21:28.123 --> 21:31.525
I knew a fella once,
got his record on the radio.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.863
It was all over in a flash.

21:33.998 --> 21:36.995
Mama, I'm just trying
to take care of you and Daddy.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.000
That's all I have
ever cared about.

21:39.135 --> 21:40.703
I ain't ever gonna let us
get back to a place again

21:40.838 --> 21:42.098
where Daddy gets in trouble
with the law

21:42.233 --> 21:43.772
-to put food on the table.
-Elvis!

21:44.913 --> 21:46.137
How dare you?

21:47.115 --> 21:48.346
As the good Lord warns us,

21:48.482 --> 21:50.845
do not wear yourself out
to get rich.

21:50.980 --> 21:54.818
Do not trust your own
goddamn cleverness!

21:57.621 --> 22:00.558
Elvis, you've upset your mama.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.804
You know, Mama,
I was thinkin',

22:15.940 --> 22:17.874
maybe I'll buy you one of them
pink Cadillacs

22:18.010 --> 22:20.072
like you saw back when
you was working
at the hospital.

22:21.249 --> 22:23.108
I don't need no pink Cadillac.

22:24.681 --> 22:27.044
Satnin, I just gotta be making

22:27.180 --> 22:28.852
the most of this thing
while I can.

22:28.988 --> 22:31.719
It's like Daddy says, this
could all be over in a flash.

22:31.855 --> 22:34.556
I'm not fearful
of it being over, Booby.

22:34.691 --> 22:37.560
I don't know how to explain it.

22:37.696 --> 22:41.458
But I saw it
in that girl's eyes.

22:41.594 --> 22:45.730
It's something beyond us,
but I know that whatever it is,

22:45.865 --> 22:48.440
it's something that...

22:48.575 --> 22:51.168
It's something
that can come between us.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.577
-Oh, no, Mama, no. Hey.

22:54.713 --> 22:56.642
Ain't nothing ever
gonna do that.

22:56.778 --> 22:59.845
You're my girl. My Satnin.

22:59.980 --> 23:02.248
You'll always be
my bestest girl.

23:02.384 --> 23:04.121
Hey.

23:04.257 --> 23:07.120
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

23:07.255 --> 23:10.320
-I will call you every night.

23:13.399 --> 23:15.292
Will you promise me, Booby?

23:16.234 --> 23:18.227
I promise.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.768
I promise. I promise,
I promise.

23:20.904 --> 23:22.901
-All right. I love you.
-Bye, baby.

23:23.036 --> 23:24.569
<i> Nothing but nothing...</i>

23:24.704 --> 23:25.673
I love you.

23:25.808 --> 23:27.271
<i>...is gonna come between us.</i>

23:27.406 --> 23:29.409
-Let's go!
-Bye, Booby!

23:29.545 --> 23:30.945
See you soon!

23:31.779 --> 23:34.753
Wanna bet?

23:34.888 --> 23:38.051
<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

23:38.186 --> 23:40.153
<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

23:40.289 --> 23:45.021
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

23:45.157 --> 23:46.565
<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

23:46.700 --> 23:49.998
<i>But stay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

23:50.133 --> 23:52.835
<i>Well, you can knock me down</i>
<i>Step in my face</i>

23:52.970 --> 23:54.634
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

23:54.769 --> 23:56.267
<i>I have some good news.</i>

23:56.403 --> 23:59.502
<i>Our next four nights</i>
<i>are sold out...</i>

23:59.637 --> 24:01.272
<i>...thanks to the dazzling</i>
<i>performances</i>

24:01.408 --> 24:05.410
<i>of our tremendous showman,</i>
<i>Hank Snow.</i>

24:05.546 --> 24:12.515
<i>Pardon me if I'm sentimental</i>
<i>When we say goodbye</i>

24:12.650 --> 24:14.218
<i> And I've noticed</i>
<i>a mild interest</i>

24:14.353 --> 24:16.787
<i>in our newest act,</i>
<i>Elvis Presley.</i>

24:23.566 --> 24:24.767
Hi.

24:24.903 --> 24:26.468
Yeah, Dixie, I'll be back
before prom.

24:31.174 --> 24:33.942
<i>Well you can burn my house</i>
<i>Steal my car</i>

24:34.077 --> 24:36.549
<i>Drink my liquor</i>
<i>From an old fruit jar</i>

24:36.684 --> 24:38.607
<i>Do anything</i>
<i>that you want to do</i>

24:38.743 --> 24:41.014
Colonel,
what is that boy
doing on our tour?

24:41.149 --> 24:42.654
Well, I told you
all about him.

24:42.789 --> 24:44.748
And he wants to record
one of your songs.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.255
Oh? Which one?

24:46.390 --> 24:47.390
All of them.

24:47.526 --> 24:49.487
Well, you warn him plenty.

24:49.623 --> 24:53.790
None of those lewd gyrations
or sudden, jerky movements.

24:57.236 --> 24:58.538
Let's go!

24:59.634 --> 25:00.870
Let's rock!

25:09.112 --> 25:10.974
Is that a pair
of young ladies' intimates

25:11.109 --> 25:12.350
I see upon the stage?

25:12.485 --> 25:14.543
Yes, I believe it is, Hank.

25:14.678 --> 25:17.518
Best not happen
when he sings one of my songs.

25:17.653 --> 25:19.186
I'm sure it won't.

25:19.322 --> 25:20.592
<i> Elvis, the papers say</i>
<i>there are girls</i>

25:20.728 --> 25:22.155
<i>around your hotel</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

25:22.291 --> 25:23.890
<i>I don't even go out, Mama.</i>
<i>I stay in.</i>

25:24.025 --> 25:25.998
<i>You know, it gets lonesome.</i>

25:26.133 --> 25:28.459
<i> I tell you, this</i>
<i>new sensation, Elvis Presley,</i>

25:28.594 --> 25:30.436
<i>he's breaking hearts</i>
<i>all over the South.</i>

25:30.571 --> 25:32.033
Quit knocking at my door,
Scotty.

25:37.408 --> 25:43.583
<i>Are you sorry</i>
<i>We drifted apart?</i>

25:45.445 --> 25:48.544
<i>Never know</i>
<i>How much I love you</i>

25:49.721 --> 25:53.691
<i>Never know how much I care</i>

25:53.826 --> 25:56.919
<i>When you put your arms</i>
<i>around me</i>

26:00.765 --> 26:02.460
<i> Oh, come on, E.P.</i>

26:02.595 --> 26:05.061
Life on the road ain't
the concern of folks back home.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.395
<i> Fever</i>

26:06.531 --> 26:08.231
Why don't you try
one of these?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.533
Put the pep back
into your step.

26:10.668 --> 26:13.206
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

26:15.081 --> 26:17.241
<i>Well, shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

26:17.377 --> 26:19.580
<i>I said shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

26:19.715 --> 26:22.486
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>

26:22.621 --> 26:23.747
<i>Well, you won't do right</i>

26:23.882 --> 26:24.818
Whoo!

26:24.954 --> 26:26.318
<i>To save your doggone soul</i>

26:26.453 --> 26:27.625
You're really
something else, man!

26:27.761 --> 26:29.090
I promise,
I'll put my heart in--

26:29.226 --> 26:30.461
-I wanna be just like you!

26:30.597 --> 26:32.158
Okay. Yeah, thank you.

26:32.293 --> 26:33.925
I can no longer,
in good conscience,

26:34.061 --> 26:35.290
go on stage with that boy.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.397
Yes, a conundrum. A conundrum.

26:38.532 --> 26:41.906
Please welcome
to the stage, Hank Snow!

26:42.041 --> 26:45.710
After I perform, I shall
spend the night in prayer.

26:45.845 --> 26:48.505
And I will do
what needs to be done.

26:57.554 --> 26:58.955
Come on, Jimmie!

27:01.322 --> 27:04.859
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

27:04.994 --> 27:07.490
<i>Oh, baby</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

27:07.625 --> 27:10.703
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

27:22.279 --> 27:24.541
<i> That night,</i>
<i>I happened to see him.</i>

27:25.284 --> 27:26.686
<i>Alone.</i>

27:27.650 --> 27:28.688
<i>Lost.</i>

27:31.757 --> 27:36.152
<i>A snowman is only as good...</i>

27:36.287 --> 27:38.394
<i>as his attraction.</i>

27:38.530 --> 27:40.194
Elvis!

27:40.329 --> 27:42.031
-Come on, man.
-Elvis, come on! Hurry up!

27:46.764 --> 27:49.237
<i> It was all,</i>
<i>or nothing.</i>

27:49.372 --> 27:50.769
Elvis, we're going
to the hall of mirrors!

27:50.904 --> 27:52.438
Wait up!

27:52.573 --> 27:54.412
Screw the hall
of mirrors. That's boring.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.517
Right, hang on.
Here we go.

28:04.588 --> 28:05.417
Hold on.

28:07.154 --> 28:08.893
All right, fellas. Come on.

28:12.325 --> 28:14.690
-Oh.
-Lost, my boy?

28:16.536 --> 28:18.232
Colonel Parker, sir.

28:20.905 --> 28:23.707
-You look lost.

28:23.842 --> 28:26.108
-I guess I am.
-Ah, yes.

28:26.244 --> 28:29.914
The roar of the crowd.
The life on the road.

28:30.049 --> 28:32.177
And then calling home
to your loved ones,

28:32.312 --> 28:34.319
pretending nothing has changed,

28:34.455 --> 28:36.888
when everything has.

28:37.786 --> 28:40.122
Yeah. Lost.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.455
I'm sorry, sir. I... I meant
I don't know the way out.

28:44.591 --> 28:49.130
Yeah, that is precisely
what I am saying.

28:49.266 --> 28:54.096
I... I saw you.
Apart from all the others.

28:54.231 --> 28:56.468
Burdened.

28:56.603 --> 28:59.273
Like you don't know
how to get out of this.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.737
But I do.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.043
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

29:05.178 --> 29:06.417
Allow me to show you.

29:06.553 --> 29:09.421
<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

29:09.557 --> 29:13.989
<i>Take his magic hand</i>

29:14.124 --> 29:15.960
Creatures of the carnival.

29:16.095 --> 29:18.259
-And I am one myself.

29:18.394 --> 29:21.524
It's where I learned the art
of the snow job.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.034
-Snow job?
-Yes.

29:23.169 --> 29:24.802
It's like the trick
you do with the wiggling,

29:24.938 --> 29:26.496
getting all the girls
hyped up,

29:26.631 --> 29:28.203
empty their wallets
and leave them

29:28.338 --> 29:30.771
with nothing but the smiles
on their faces.

29:30.906 --> 29:31.970
I'm no trickster.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.906
Oh, yes, you are.

29:34.042 --> 29:36.238
All showmen are snowmen.

29:36.374 --> 29:38.108
It's a wonderful place.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.643
Nobody on the aerio.

29:43.519 --> 29:47.454
Your future, Mr. Presley,
blazing before you.

29:47.589 --> 29:50.830
Recording contracts,
television, even Hollywood.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.001
You're great, Colonel.

29:56.136 --> 29:59.234
You are the best person
I could ever hope to work with.

29:59.369 --> 30:00.867
You know, this is something
I ain't never

30:01.003 --> 30:02.840
said to nobody before...

30:02.976 --> 30:04.804
But I believe
I can be great, too.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.536
Oh, no doubt.

30:06.672 --> 30:09.643
But we could be
even greater together.

30:09.778 --> 30:14.853
But to achieve this, I need
to represent you exclusively.

30:14.989 --> 30:17.285
Exclusively?
Sir, I... I don't follow.

30:18.823 --> 30:20.050
What about Hank Snow?

30:20.185 --> 30:21.989
Hank. Yes...

30:22.124 --> 30:24.061
He sent me here to fire you.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.491
Hank wants you off the tour.

30:29.627 --> 30:33.070
So I will have to leave Hank.

30:34.370 --> 30:36.339
We will both have to
make sacrifices.

30:36.475 --> 30:39.703
We will need a record label
with national distribution.

30:41.546 --> 30:43.080
RCA?

30:44.912 --> 30:46.750
RCA.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.482
Sam Phillips... discovered me.

30:49.618 --> 30:52.882
I know, but we have a way
to help Sam understand

30:53.017 --> 30:56.054
that it would be foolish of him
to hold you back.

30:56.190 --> 30:58.259
Every man has his price.

30:58.395 --> 31:00.295
RCA does have
the distribution.

31:00.430 --> 31:01.424
I just need to know
that you'll

31:01.559 --> 31:02.825
still be with me as friends.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.996
Don't doubt that,
we're not going anywhere.

31:05.131 --> 31:08.664
Marion and I just don't want to
stand in your way, that's all.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.069
The world needs
to hear you sing, Elvis.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.475
<i> Elvis Presley's</i>
<i>contract sold to RCA today</i>

31:14.610 --> 31:16.575
<i>for the highest price</i>
<i>in music history.</i>

31:16.710 --> 31:19.180
<i>Quite the payday</i>
<i>for Sun Records.</i>

31:19.315 --> 31:22.247
It's just business.
Show business.

31:22.383 --> 31:23.679
To achieve truly great things,

31:23.815 --> 31:26.090
one must make
truly great sacrifices.

31:26.225 --> 31:29.786
You will have to be free
of any entanglements.

31:29.922 --> 31:33.596
You see, my boy,
show business is snow business.

31:33.731 --> 31:37.598
<i>And the fans need to believe</i>
<i>that you are always available.</i>

31:37.733 --> 31:39.295
The Colonel says
that with all the publicity

31:39.431 --> 31:40.806
that's gonna be coming,

31:40.942 --> 31:42.966
he might have to
put it out there that...

31:43.102 --> 31:44.432
That...

31:44.568 --> 31:46.609
I don't have a girl.

31:50.109 --> 31:53.547
Then we will need
your parents' legal commitment.

31:53.682 --> 31:57.155
They may need a bit
of convincing themselves.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.157
Sam Phillips
is a good man we can trust.

31:59.292 --> 32:02.489
We don't know this Colonel
from a nail in a wall.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.453
Is there a lawyer
representing the family?

32:04.589 --> 32:05.728
Oh, unnecessary.

32:05.864 --> 32:07.462
I am of the firm opinion

32:07.598 --> 32:10.902
that family is the most
important thing in the world.

32:11.038 --> 32:13.628
In mind of that,
I have taken the liberty

32:13.764 --> 32:15.469
of making these contracts out

32:15.604 --> 32:18.675
in the name
of Elvis Presley Enterprises.

32:18.810 --> 32:20.043
A family business.

32:20.179 --> 32:22.844
And I was thinking,
Vernon -

32:22.979 --> 32:24.445
Business Manager.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.720
What do you think,
Daddy?

32:29.856 --> 32:32.123
Uh... Well, uh...

32:32.258 --> 32:33.986
-I like it very much, son.
-Ah!

32:35.987 --> 32:39.293
Mrs. Presley,
your son has a unique gift.

32:39.428 --> 32:40.863
It's as though
he has the strength

32:40.999 --> 32:43.325
of two men inside of him.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.700
<i> You know, Colonel,</i>
<i>I would do anything</i>

32:46.835 --> 32:48.399
<i>to make sure my mama and daddy</i>
<i>never have to live</i>

32:48.535 --> 32:50.371
<i>in no poverty ever again.</i>

32:50.507 --> 32:53.971
Mama, it's gonna turn out
so, so good.

32:54.107 --> 32:55.311
Mm.

32:58.650 --> 33:00.019
Colonel, I wasn't fooling
when I told those other kids

33:00.154 --> 33:01.582
I was gonna buy 'em
a Cadillac one day.

33:01.717 --> 33:04.146
My boy, with me, you will
buy them two Cadillacs.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.552
Two?

33:06.956 --> 33:07.991
A hundred?

33:08.126 --> 33:09.223
-Two hundred.

33:09.358 --> 33:11.188
-A thousand.
-A million.

33:11.324 --> 33:12.559
An aeroplane.

33:12.694 --> 33:14.630
-How about a rocket ship?

33:14.766 --> 33:19.038
Well, maybe not a rocket ship.
My mama don't like me to fly.

33:19.173 --> 33:23.241
But me, I've always
wanted to fly. Fast.

33:23.377 --> 33:27.009
Faster than the speed of light
to the Rock of Eternity.

33:27.145 --> 33:29.240
What? To the Rock of Eternity?

33:29.376 --> 33:30.874
Captain Marvel, Jr.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.712
He's my favorite
comic book hero.

33:34.852 --> 33:36.581
He flies.

33:36.717 --> 33:38.552
Well, what about you,
Mr. Presley?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.522
Are you ready to fly?

33:42.455 --> 33:44.822
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

33:45.699 --> 33:47.022
Ready to fly.

33:55.232 --> 33:56.836
<i>Uh, Mr. Presley,</i>

33:56.971 --> 33:58.900
<i>try not to move around</i>
<i>so much during the takes.</i>

33:59.036 --> 34:01.278
If I can't move,
I can't sing.

34:01.413 --> 34:04.209
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

34:06.011 --> 34:09.211
<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

34:09.347 --> 34:10.948
<i> What is he doing?</i>
<i>We paid for this?</i>

34:11.083 --> 34:12.849
<i>It's down at the end of</i>
<i>Lonely Street at...</i>

34:12.984 --> 34:14.693
<i>It's a suicide song.</i>

34:14.829 --> 34:17.388
<i>...Heartbreak Hotel</i>

34:17.523 --> 34:20.260
<i> Them know-it-alls</i>
<i>said I'd backed</i>
<i>the wrong horse.</i>

34:20.396 --> 34:22.597
<i>But my boy knew teenagers.</i>

34:22.733 --> 34:26.934
<i>And that first record</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

34:27.069 --> 34:31.672
<i>Well, it's so very hard to have</i>
<i>To leave the one you love</i>

34:31.808 --> 34:35.037
<i>And you get more lonely</i>
<i>With each passing day</i>

34:36.781 --> 34:41.250
<i>It's so lonely just sitting</i>
<i>And dreaming of...</i>

34:41.386 --> 34:42.782
<i>In a few short months,</i>

34:42.917 --> 34:44.618
<i>Elvis Presley has popped</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

34:44.754 --> 34:46.885
<i>Everywhere he goes,</i>
<i>he causes riots,</i>

34:47.020 --> 34:49.625
<i>mountains of press</i>
<i>and rivers of money.</i>

34:49.761 --> 34:52.121
<i> It's another</i>
<i>gold record for Elvis Presley.</i>

34:52.256 --> 34:54.958
<i>This one giving him his first</i>
<i>worldwide hit.</i>

34:59.401 --> 35:02.473
Mrs. Presley, look!

35:02.609 --> 35:05.803
Come on, Mrs. Presley,
let me show you
how to use this.

35:05.939 --> 35:08.112
Come on, hens! Come on, hens!
Come on!

35:08.248 --> 35:11.808
Come on! Outside!
Out of my house!

35:11.943 --> 35:14.450
Come on, this way!
Come on, babies!

35:15.314 --> 35:16.619
Dodger!

35:21.118 --> 35:23.018
-Go, Billy boy!
-Ya-hoo-hoo!

35:23.153 --> 35:24.962
<i> I took</i>
<i>my boy's wiggling</i>

35:25.098 --> 35:27.657
<i>and put it in the movies.</i>

35:27.793 --> 35:29.659
<i>I took his name and face,</i>

35:29.794 --> 35:31.500
<i>and put it on all sorts of toys</i>

35:31.635 --> 35:33.671
<i>and knick-knacks,</i>
<i>and called it...</i>

35:33.807 --> 35:35.096
"Merchandise."

35:35.232 --> 35:37.605
Your face on every
conceivable object,

35:37.740 --> 35:41.142
including teddy bear, perfume,
plaster busts...

35:41.278 --> 35:42.473
Of questionable likeness.

35:42.609 --> 35:44.139
"The Elvis Presley Game."

35:44.274 --> 35:47.384
Something so everyone
can show their love.

35:47.519 --> 35:51.883
Grandma Dodger,
what is that behind your ear?

35:53.025 --> 35:55.051
"I hate Elvis."

35:57.059 --> 35:58.389
Huh?

35:58.524 --> 36:00.054
Yes. I hate Elvis.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.733
In my way of thinking,
"I love Elvis,"

36:01.869 --> 36:03.068
that's an easy sell.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.894
Those who hate your son
will do so

36:05.029 --> 36:07.635
whether we profit
from it or not.

36:07.771 --> 36:12.409
After all, what is hate worth
if it's free?

36:13.771 --> 36:15.379
Oh, yeah. I get it.

36:19.150 --> 36:20.652
Snowman strikes again.

36:23.087 --> 36:25.719
Merchandise,
promotion.
Diskin, what else do we have?

36:25.854 --> 36:27.359
-Necklaces.
-Necklaces.

36:27.494 --> 36:30.427
-Scarves.
-Oh, scarves. Yes...

36:30.562 --> 36:33.095
<i> Mr. Presley</i>
<i>and Mr. King...</i>

36:33.230 --> 36:34.429
regular peas in a pod,

36:34.565 --> 36:36.296
relieving me
of my finest threads.

36:36.431 --> 36:37.529
Must be some occasion.

36:37.665 --> 36:38.895
Mr. Lansky, it's Milton Berle.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.828
The whole of America'll
be watching.

36:40.964 --> 36:42.907
I don't watch television.

36:43.042 --> 36:44.241
So what's it gonna be?

36:44.377 --> 36:46.101
How you gonna
blow their wigs off?

36:46.237 --> 36:49.612
Well, the network
wants me to do a ballad.

36:49.747 --> 36:51.616
But I'm thinking about
cuttin' it up with "Hound Dog."

36:51.751 --> 36:53.110
Whoo!

36:53.245 --> 36:59.113
Elvis Presley, "Hound Dog,"
and Uncle Miltie.

36:59.249 --> 37:01.152
Strange things
are happening every day.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.060
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog, hound dog</i>

37:04.196 --> 37:06.298
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

37:06.433 --> 37:08.790
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

37:08.926 --> 37:11.369
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

37:11.504 --> 37:13.129
<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

37:13.264 --> 37:15.801
<i>And you ain't</i>
<i>no friend of mine</i>

37:15.937 --> 37:18.537
<i>When they said</i>
<i>You was high classed</i>

37:18.673 --> 37:20.906
<i>Well, that was just a lie</i>

37:21.041 --> 37:23.708
<i>Yeah, they said</i>
<i>You were high classed</i>

37:23.844 --> 37:26.107
Behold, tomorrow,
all of America

37:26.243 --> 37:28.413
will be talking
about Elvis Presley.

37:28.549 --> 37:29.515
<i>My wiggling boy.</i>

37:31.986 --> 37:34.187
Even as a little one,
he made me laugh so.

37:34.323 --> 37:36.123
He's so funny!

37:36.258 --> 37:38.297
<i>You never caught a rabbit</i>
<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

37:42.364 --> 37:44.831
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog,</i>
<i>a hound dog</i>

37:46.436 --> 37:47.766
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

37:47.902 --> 37:49.238
And, Senator,
for the next leg

37:49.374 --> 37:50.804
of your racial integrity tour,

37:50.940 --> 37:53.935
we booked the Overton
Park Shell in Memphis.

37:54.071 --> 37:55.803
What are they laughing about?

37:58.751 --> 38:01.980
<i> You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

38:03.321 --> 38:05.781
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

38:05.916 --> 38:07.993
Who the hell is that?

38:08.128 --> 38:10.291
It's that boy from Memphis.

38:10.427 --> 38:12.590
Elvis Presley.

38:12.726 --> 38:14.829
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

38:14.964 --> 38:19.329
A white boy from Memphis,
moving like a goddamn--

38:19.465 --> 38:25.344
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain</i>

38:26.806 --> 38:29.374
<i>Shall I come back...</i>

38:29.509 --> 38:34.345
<i>The obscenity and vulgarity</i>
<i>of this rock and roll music</i>

38:34.481 --> 38:38.214
<i>is obviously a means by which</i>
<i>the white man and his children</i>

38:38.350 --> 38:40.484
<i>can be driven to the level</i>
<i>of the Negro.</i>

38:40.620 --> 38:42.520
<i> The colored folks have</i>
<i>been singing and playing it</i>

38:42.655 --> 38:45.021
<i>just like</i>
<i>I'm doing it now, man,</i>
<i>more years than I know.</i>

38:45.157 --> 38:46.528
Colonel Parker,
we called you in here

38:46.664 --> 38:48.324
to talk about this act
of yours.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.962
<i> A petition</i>
<i>has begun circulating</i>

38:50.098 --> 38:52.535
<i>to bar Elvis Presley</i>
<i>from television.</i>

38:52.671 --> 38:54.232
<i>We've set up a committee</i>

38:54.367 --> 38:56.905
<i>to keep an eye on this vulgar,</i>
<i>animalistic rock and roll bum.</i>

38:57.041 --> 38:58.736
<i> Your style</i>
<i>of gyrating while you sing</i>

38:58.871 --> 39:00.168
<i>has been bitterly criticized...</i>

39:00.304 --> 39:02.010
I don't feel I'm doing
anything wrong.

39:02.145 --> 39:04.075
<i> We simply will not</i>
<i>advertise on any station</i>

39:04.211 --> 39:05.847
<i>that puts this delinquent</i>
<i>on television.</i>

39:05.983 --> 39:08.678
Colonel, you put an end
to your boy's animal behavior,

39:08.813 --> 39:10.679
<i>or we will.</i>

39:10.815 --> 39:13.356
<i> Don't worry, Senator,</i>
<i>my boy does what he's told.</i>

39:13.491 --> 39:16.050
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

39:16.186 --> 39:21.697
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

39:25.864 --> 39:27.837
"Elvis the Pelvis."

39:27.973 --> 39:30.899
That's one of the most childish
expressions I've ever heard

39:31.034 --> 39:33.038
coming from an adult.

39:33.173 --> 39:35.106
Is Mr. Allen gonna cancel me
from the show?

39:35.849 --> 39:37.079
Yes.

39:37.214 --> 39:39.279
Yes, he is.

39:39.414 --> 39:43.422
He is replacing you with one of
the country's greatest singers.

39:44.848 --> 39:46.253
Mario Lanza?

39:46.388 --> 39:47.619
Someone greater.

39:47.754 --> 39:50.561
The new Elvis Presley!

39:52.528 --> 39:54.697
Yeah, I snowed 'em!

39:54.833 --> 39:57.365
You just have to put on
one of these tails here,

39:57.501 --> 39:58.966
can sing the "Hound Dog,"

39:59.101 --> 40:02.239
and it's a light-hearted,
sophisticated family show.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.602
I can't move in one of these.

40:03.737 --> 40:04.670
And that is the point.

40:04.806 --> 40:06.839
Mr. Allen agreed only as long

40:06.974 --> 40:09.308
as there is no wiggling
of those hips.

40:09.444 --> 40:11.749
I can't figure it out. My own
mother approves of what I do.

40:11.885 --> 40:13.483
Mmm.

40:13.618 --> 40:16.317
You have read the papers,
my boy?

40:16.453 --> 40:18.118
Yeah, I read the papers.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.591
The papers say that I shot
my mother and smoke marijuana.

40:20.726 --> 40:23.660
Your movement's
in the style of a Black man,

40:23.795 --> 40:26.124
and you have broken
the segregation laws.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.258
So let's follow the plan.
It's a good plan.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.425
You do the<i> Allen Show,</i>
family style,

40:30.561 --> 40:33.002
and then tomorrow
we go back to Memphis and

40:33.137 --> 40:36.807
we snow them on the July 4th
Children's Charitable Concert.

40:36.942 --> 40:40.037
And we put this whole
unfortunate misstep behind us.

40:40.173 --> 40:42.545
Now, do you want
to go into politics?

40:42.681 --> 40:45.550
Or shall we stay
in show business?

40:48.285 --> 40:49.753
<i> We want to do</i>
<i>a show the whole family</i>

40:49.888 --> 40:51.781
<i>can watch and enjoy,</i>
<i>and we always do.</i>

40:51.916 --> 40:53.157
<i>And at this time, it gives me</i>
<i>extreme pleasure to introduce</i>

40:53.292 --> 40:54.992
<i>the new Elvis Presley!</i>

40:59.292 --> 41:00.663
<i>He used to be so hip.</i>

41:00.798 --> 41:02.526
<i>He looked so silly.</i>

41:02.662 --> 41:04.529
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he looked like a butler.</i>

41:04.665 --> 41:05.899
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i>he agreed to sing to a dog.</i>

41:06.034 --> 41:07.198
-God damn it!

41:09.642 --> 41:11.005
He could've given us
some warning.

41:11.141 --> 41:12.877
I know how to do a skit,
I could've made it funny!

41:13.013 --> 41:16.505
The most stupid, embarrassing,
humiliating thing I ever did.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.147
Well, what the hell
do you want me to do about it?

41:18.282 --> 41:19.550
We're musicians!

41:19.686 --> 41:21.014
<i>It's just embarrassing.</i>

41:21.149 --> 41:22.310
<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

41:40.699 --> 41:43.598
<i> She just went on</i>
<i>and on about the damn dog.</i>

41:43.733 --> 41:45.901
And I said, "Neighbors
shouldn't speak like that."

41:46.037 --> 41:47.509
And then she said...

41:47.644 --> 41:49.408
I like the bit with the dog.

41:49.543 --> 41:51.713
It was the most embarrassing
performance of my life, Daddy.

41:51.849 --> 41:53.913
She wasn't the only one
who said it.

41:54.048 --> 41:55.717
-All the neighbors did.
-Oh, God.

41:55.853 --> 41:57.355
Those New York people
were using you

41:57.490 --> 41:59.054
to poke fun at the whole South.

41:59.190 --> 42:02.825
Getting a laugh out of putting
a hillbilly in a tailcoat

42:02.960 --> 42:05.291
-and singing to a dog.

42:05.427 --> 42:08.057
God damn it, Mama, it was
either that or I get canceled.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.099
Then that's it for television.

42:10.234 --> 42:12.868
Colonel says I'm running out
of states that I'm welcome in.

42:13.003 --> 42:15.532
And they don't pay
unless I can perform.

42:15.668 --> 42:18.208
So Colonel says I play the
charity concert tomorrow night,

42:18.344 --> 42:20.702
as the new family style,

42:20.837 --> 42:23.574
then everybody calms down
and we get back on track.

42:23.709 --> 42:26.348
Someone's got to think about
keeping a roof over our heads.

42:26.484 --> 42:28.183
Roof over our head?

42:28.318 --> 42:30.953
We've always managed to keep
a roof over our head, Vernon.

42:31.089 --> 42:32.784
Mama, Daddy is
business manager.
It's his job.

42:32.919 --> 42:34.451
That's right.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.757
We was doing just fine
before that man came along.

42:36.892 --> 42:38.254
Colonel has got us all of this.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.826
I don't want all this!
You're unhappy!

42:40.962 --> 42:42.733
-I am not!

42:43.965 --> 42:45.829
You're losing yourself, Booby!

42:45.965 --> 42:47.632
Oh, hell, Mama, I--

42:47.768 --> 42:49.137
Satnin knows.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.776
The way you sing
and move...

42:59.911 --> 43:01.543
it's God-given.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.146
So there can't be nothing
wrong with it.

43:07.827 --> 43:09.753
Hey, I'm gonna ask cousin
about the movie.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.254
Hey, E.P., E.P.!

43:11.389 --> 43:12.694
Can we close down
the movie house

43:12.829 --> 43:14.092
and watch<i> Godzilla</i> tonight?

43:14.228 --> 43:16.526
Don't tramp mud
in the house, Billy!

43:16.661 --> 43:17.932
But you said
we could watch the movie!

43:18.067 --> 43:19.763
Get out! Get out of my
goddamn house!

43:19.898 --> 43:21.338
-You said
you'd take us!
-Tramping mud in my house

43:21.474 --> 43:22.767
and doing my damn head in.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.173
Mama, you ain't never happy.

43:26.309 --> 43:28.840
No matter what I do,
no matter how much I give you,

43:28.975 --> 43:30.407
it ain't never enough.

43:30.543 --> 43:32.976
And, I wish you would not drink
so goddamn much.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.579
It's not good for you.

43:34.714 --> 43:36.083
Baby!

43:36.218 --> 43:37.612
-Put that back in the shed!
-Elvis, wait!

43:41.419 --> 43:45.158
Elvis! Elvis, come on!
Elvis!

43:48.131 --> 43:49.459
<i>Here's Elvis Presley.</i>

44:06.746 --> 44:09.216
<i> This is</i>
<i>Rufus Thomas here from WDIA.</i>

44:09.351 --> 44:11.984
<i>You can catch B.B. King tonight</i>
<i>at Club Handy,</i>

44:12.119 --> 44:13.857
<i>with Sister Rosetta Tharpe.</i>

44:43.917 --> 44:45.218
Hello.

44:48.988 --> 44:50.729
E.P.!

44:52.722 --> 44:54.733
-B.B.! Hey!
-Get over here!

44:58.503 --> 44:59.738
Have a good night.

45:07.713 --> 45:09.275
Thank you. Have a good night.

45:14.187 --> 45:15.149
Hello.

45:22.118 --> 45:23.091
Hey!

45:30.002 --> 45:34.102
Get him! Get him in here!
E.P.! E.P.!

45:36.337 --> 45:38.810
All right, all right.
Thank you.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.274
<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop</i>
<i>Ba-lop, bom, bom</i>

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

45:46.218 --> 45:48.479
Got my mama going on
about the "Hound Dog,"

45:48.614 --> 45:49.953
and the Colonel's
got me wearing tails,

45:50.088 --> 45:50.750
and everybody wants
something different.

45:50.885 --> 45:52.151
Hey, listen, man.

45:52.287 --> 45:53.347
If you're sad
and you want to be sad,

45:53.483 --> 45:54.992
you're at the right place.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.790
If you're happy and you want
to be happy, guess what?

45:56.926 --> 45:58.428
You're at the right place.

45:58.564 --> 46:00.793
So just do me a favor...

46:00.929 --> 46:01.960
Let it all hang out.

46:02.096 --> 46:04.230
Let it all hang out, E.P.!

46:04.366 --> 46:08.171
-Let it all hang out, baby.

46:08.306 --> 46:10.732
<i>She rocks to the east</i>
<i>She rocks to the west</i>

46:10.867 --> 46:13.006

<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty, uh!</i>

46:28.760 --> 46:31.093
Whoo! Man, he's cuttin' it!

46:33.465 --> 46:36.692
Sister Rosetta found this kid
in the backwaters of Georgia.

46:46.774 --> 46:48.913
They should get the Colonel
to book him on Steve Allen.

46:53.147 --> 46:55.150
They would love his moves.

46:57.788 --> 47:00.316
<i>Got a girl named Daisy</i>

47:00.452 --> 47:02.526
<i>She almost drives me crazy</i>

47:02.661 --> 47:04.294
<i>Got a girl named Daisy</i>

47:04.429 --> 47:05.354
Whoo!

47:05.490 --> 47:07.855
<i>She almost drives me crazy</i>

47:07.991 --> 47:10.133
<i>She knows how to love me</i>
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

47:10.268 --> 47:12.536
<i>Boy, you don't know</i>
<i>What she do to me</i>

47:12.671 --> 47:14.664
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

47:14.799 --> 47:17.168
Man, he sings the hell
out of that song!

47:17.303 --> 47:18.899
I would love to record that.

47:19.035 --> 47:21.207
If you do, you'll make
a whole lot more money

47:21.343 --> 47:22.876
than that kid
could ever dream of.

47:23.011 --> 47:25.411
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

47:25.547 --> 47:27.685
<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop,</i>

<i> Workin'</i>

47:48.600 --> 47:51.600
<i>It's the new foundation</i>

47:51.736 --> 47:54.976
<i>The new foundation</i>

47:55.112 --> 47:57.414
<i>I'm goin' to heaven</i>

47:57.549 --> 47:58.439
Yeah!

47:58.575 --> 47:59.742
<i> Goin' to heaven</i>

48:00.851 --> 48:03.180
<i>To get my reward</i>

48:03.316 --> 48:07.017
<i> Get my reward</i>

48:07.153 --> 48:08.359
Whoo!

48:09.829 --> 48:12.688
Ha-ha! That's all right.

48:12.824 --> 48:15.461
That's a nice ride
you rode up in tonight.

48:15.596 --> 48:18.193
It ain't like your ol'
big B.B. King bus.

48:19.801 --> 48:22.073
Big Red.

48:22.208 --> 48:25.505
Yeah, well, I can go where
I want, play what I want,

48:25.640 --> 48:27.737
and if they don't like it,
I can go someplace else.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.838
You've got to be
in control, man.

48:30.973 --> 48:32.908
You should have your own label,
like me.

48:33.043 --> 48:35.546
You don't do the business,
the business will do you.

48:35.682 --> 48:37.912
Man, I just leave all that
to the Colonel.

48:40.054 --> 48:42.220
So it's, um...

48:42.356 --> 48:44.424
It's his idea, this new Elvis?

48:45.523 --> 48:47.088
Listen, I don't get it, man.

48:47.223 --> 48:49.663
Cats buy your records
because they like what you do,

48:49.799 --> 48:53.501
not because you're dressed up
like some... like some butler.

48:53.637 --> 48:55.972
You really think those kids
want to see Elvis the butler

48:56.108 --> 48:57.334
at the Russwood Park
gig tomorrow?

48:57.470 --> 48:58.966
Man, I ain't wearing no tails.

48:59.101 --> 49:02.873
I just...
gotta lay off the moves,
is all.

49:03.009 --> 49:05.480
Colonel says if I don't,
they're gonna put me in jail.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.317
Come on, man.

49:11.453 --> 49:13.015
They're not gonna
put you in jail.

49:13.151 --> 49:14.648
They might put me in jail
for walking across the street,

49:14.784 --> 49:16.292
but you're a famous white boy.

49:16.427 --> 49:18.628
Too many people are making
too much money off of you

49:18.764 --> 49:20.288
to put you in jail.

49:20.424 --> 49:21.190
You think so?

49:21.325 --> 49:23.498
I know so.

49:23.634 --> 49:28.700
Colonel's a smart man.
There's gotta be
another reason.

49:31.677 --> 49:34.575
<i>Every day, yes</i>

49:34.710 --> 49:38.641
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

49:38.777 --> 49:41.481
Hey, Elvis, B.B.!
Give us a smile.

49:44.316 --> 49:46.356
<i>Every day</i>

49:46.492 --> 49:48.852
<i> You promised us</i>
<i>a new Elvis, Colonel.</i>

49:48.988 --> 49:52.889
Yet, here he is with this
B.B. King at Club Handy,

49:53.024 --> 49:56.056
jiggling and wiggling
with Billy Ward, and here,

49:56.192 --> 49:59.400
on Colored Night
at the Memphis Fairgrounds.

49:59.535 --> 50:01.101
We've been poking
into your background,

50:01.237 --> 50:02.772
and we've found your records.

50:02.908 --> 50:05.072
"Unfit for military duty."

50:05.207 --> 50:07.673
"Acute psychopathic state."

50:07.808 --> 50:12.512
Well... I was pretending
to be crazy. I wanted out.

50:12.648 --> 50:15.044
I was just a boy
from Huntington, West Virginia.

50:15.179 --> 50:18.383
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

50:18.519 --> 50:21.754
<i>Every day, yeah</i>

50:21.889 --> 50:26.955
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

50:28.529 --> 50:31.597
<i>Every day</i>
<i>Are so strange</i>

50:31.733 --> 50:34.469
<i>Every day</i>
<i>People are stealing the planes</i>

50:34.604 --> 50:37.903
<i>Oh! There are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

50:38.038 --> 50:42.374
<i>Every day</i>
<i>Oh, ain't that</i>
<i>strange, every day</i>

50:44.313 --> 50:47.285
<i>Every day, yes</i>

50:47.420 --> 50:51.947
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

50:53.888 --> 50:56.756
<i> While 10,000 screaming</i>
<i>fans were cramming in</i>

50:56.891 --> 50:59.262
<i>to see our show,</i>
<i>Senator Eastland was holding</i>

50:59.398 --> 51:02.463
<i>a segregationist rally</i>
<i>just three miles away.</i>

51:05.734 --> 51:08.333
The mayor loved you
on the<i> Steve Allen Show.</i>

51:08.469 --> 51:11.042
All the important people did.

51:11.177 --> 51:13.243
What song are you going
to sing tonight?

51:14.110 --> 51:15.806
I've made no decision.

51:18.443 --> 51:19.876
I'll feel it.

51:26.787 --> 51:28.126
Pay no mind
to all the cameras.

51:28.261 --> 51:31.019
Those are our friends
in the vice squad.

51:31.154 --> 51:34.188
They don't mean nothing.
Ain't that right, chief?

51:34.323 --> 51:36.794
As long as you don't
so much as wiggle a finger.

51:52.383 --> 51:54.185
Oh, yes, sir,
good people!

51:54.320 --> 51:57.549
A big thank you
to Shorty Morgan's Dixie Dolls!

51:57.684 --> 51:59.716
But I know some of
the young people

51:59.852 --> 52:02.452
are very excited
about this next act!

52:04.690 --> 52:06.787
Jesse's with us tonight, baby.

52:06.923 --> 52:10.361
Play it smart out there, yeah?

52:10.497 --> 52:13.761
<i>Well, stop talking about it</i>
<i>We're talking</i>
<i>about everything</i>

52:13.897 --> 52:15.837
<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

52:15.973 --> 52:17.703
Elvis Presley!

52:17.838 --> 52:21.212
<i>Strange things happening</i>
<i>Every day</i>

52:23.646 --> 52:26.144
Just sing the nice song.
Smile the nice smile.

52:26.279 --> 52:27.647
No wiggling.

52:27.782 --> 52:29.677
Then we can get back
to our show business.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.080
And have fun, my boy! Fun!

52:35.361 --> 52:37.661
<i>Oh, we want peace!</i>

52:37.797 --> 52:39.763
<i>We want peace!</i>

52:39.899 --> 52:42.058
<i>We oughta stop</i>
<i>talkin' about it</i>
<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

52:42.193 --> 52:46.835
<i>Oh, there are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

52:46.971 --> 52:52.903
<i>Every day</i>

53:11.497 --> 53:13.631
There's been a lot of talk
about the new Elvis.

53:21.536 --> 53:23.604
And of course, that other guy.

53:27.812 --> 53:30.445
<i> You ain't</i>
<i>Nothin' but a hound dog</i>

53:30.580 --> 53:32.074
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

53:35.017 --> 53:37.248
<i> ...at his</i>
<i>command, both civil and other,</i>

53:37.383 --> 53:41.255
<i>to maintain public order,</i>
<i>and prevent crime and riots.</i>

53:41.391 --> 53:43.052
<i>He can use those forces...</i>

53:43.187 --> 53:46.730
to prevent the racial
integration of schools,

53:46.865 --> 53:50.796
if this is necessary, under the
police powers of that state...

53:50.931 --> 53:53.403
There's a lot of people
saying a lot of things.

53:53.539 --> 53:55.132
<i>...in fact, it is his duty...</i>

53:55.268 --> 53:57.568
Of course you gotta listen
to the people that you love.

53:57.703 --> 54:00.608
<i> ...and prevent</i>
<i>turmoil</i>
<i>and strife within the state.</i>

54:02.613 --> 54:04.407
But in the end,
you gotta listen to yourself.

54:06.717 --> 54:08.678
So I want you to know,
those New York people

54:08.813 --> 54:10.414
ain't gonna change me none.

54:12.382 --> 54:14.084
<i>...the subversives who own...</i>

54:14.220 --> 54:17.958
...control and dominate
the entertainment industry...

54:18.093 --> 54:19.592
-"Trouble."
<i>... are determined...</i>

54:19.728 --> 54:22.059
...to spread
Africanized culture...

54:22.194 --> 54:26.403
I'm gonna show you what
the real Elvis is like tonight!

54:26.538 --> 54:28.400
<i>...influencing your children...</i>

54:28.535 --> 54:29.807
to accept the Negroes.

54:31.367 --> 54:32.240
<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

54:32.376 --> 54:33.704
-No.
-What's going on?

54:33.839 --> 54:35.269
<i>You came to the right place</i>

54:36.812 --> 54:38.547
<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

54:40.153 --> 54:41.352
<i>Just look right in my face</i>

54:43.154 --> 54:44.784
<i>I was born standing up</i>

54:46.421 --> 54:48.525
<i>And talking back</i>

54:48.660 --> 54:54.590
<i>My daddy was a green-eyed</i>
<i>Mountain jack</i>

54:54.726 --> 54:58.926
<i>Because I'm evil</i>

54:59.061 --> 55:03.000
<i>My middle name is misery</i>

55:07.144 --> 55:10.205
<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

55:11.846 --> 55:15.353
<i>So don't you mess</i>
<i>around with me</i>

55:21.857 --> 55:22.991
<i>I've never looked</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

55:24.964 --> 55:26.496
<i>But I never ran</i>

55:28.199 --> 55:29.664
<i>I don't take no orders</i>

55:31.104 --> 55:32.403
<i>From no kind of man</i>

55:34.601 --> 55:35.769
<i>I'm only made out</i>

55:37.671 --> 55:38.936
<i>Of flesh, blood and bone</i>

55:39.072 --> 55:42.607
<i>But if you're gonna</i>
<i>Start a rumble</i>

55:42.743 --> 55:45.872
<i>Don't you try it on alone</i>

55:46.008 --> 55:49.244
<i>Because I'm evil</i>

55:50.321 --> 55:53.549
<i>My middle name is misery</i>

55:57.324 --> 55:58.356
Elvis!

55:58.492 --> 56:02.928
<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

56:03.063 --> 56:05.668
<i>So don't you</i>
<i>mess around with me</i>

56:09.606 --> 56:12.201
<i>I'm evil, evil</i>
<i>evil as can be</i>

56:13.545 --> 56:16.144
<i>I'm evil</i>
<i>evil, evil as can be</i>

56:17.381 --> 56:18.610
<i>So don't mess around</i>

56:18.746 --> 56:20.649
<i>Don't mess around with me</i>

56:21.547 --> 56:23.118
<i>I'm evil</i>

56:24.187 --> 56:25.346
<i>I'm evil</i>

56:26.490 --> 56:30.056
<i> Evil, evil</i>

56:30.192 --> 56:33.897
Uh, now would be a good time
to get back into the car.

56:34.032 --> 56:36.129
<i>I'm evil</i>

56:36.265 --> 56:37.501
<i>Evil</i>

56:38.135 --> 56:39.965
<i>Evil</i>

56:42.965 --> 56:46.103
Our friends at RCA
are not gonna
be happy when they see this.

57:01.450 --> 57:03.494
<i> He didn't listen</i>
<i>to me.</i>

57:04.891 --> 57:06.296
<i>-Why?</i>

57:06.431 --> 57:09.594
<i>Why didn't he listen to me?</i>

57:09.730 --> 57:12.129
<i> I'm evil</i>

57:13.965 --> 57:15.671
Get my boy off that stage!

57:16.999 --> 57:18.040
<i>...with me</i>

57:21.811 --> 57:24.806
Get your hands
off him. Hey!

57:24.941 --> 57:26.946
Hey, Elvis!

57:41.266 --> 57:43.295
Elvis!

57:43.430 --> 57:45.959
Go look after the merchandise.
Look after the merchandise!

57:48.537 --> 57:49.803
Elvis, come on!

57:49.938 --> 57:51.403
Get off of me!
Mama, you get in the car!

57:51.538 --> 57:53.207
Get in the car!

58:02.586 --> 58:04.313
You're gonna get us in trouble.

58:05.488 --> 58:07.050
He's all right, come on.

58:07.186 --> 58:09.190
-Elvis!
-Scotty, come on.

58:09.325 --> 58:10.352
Let's go.

58:23.632 --> 58:27.069
<i> My dear boy</i>
<i>had chosen.</i>

58:27.204 --> 58:32.013
<i>You, his audience, his fans.</i>

58:32.149 --> 58:36.585
<i>He had no idea</i>
<i>what he had done</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

58:36.721 --> 58:38.249
<i>We warned you, Colonel.</i>

58:38.385 --> 58:40.014
<i>You've lost control</i>
<i>of this act of yours.</i>

58:40.150 --> 58:41.926
<i>And he's dividing this nation.</i>

58:42.061 --> 58:46.355
<i>There are a lot of people</i>
<i>who want to see him in jail.</i>

58:46.490 --> 58:48.599
<i> I had to find</i>
<i>a way out.</i>

58:49.730 --> 58:51.602
<i>A way to save him.</i>

58:55.264 --> 58:59.709
<i> Crawfish</i>

59:01.410 --> 59:04.714
<i>Crawfish</i>

59:07.547 --> 59:12.212
No. There's no way my baby's
going to Germany for two years.

59:12.348 --> 59:16.154
It is either the army or jail.

59:17.296 --> 59:19.223
There is something else.

59:19.358 --> 59:23.062
Vernon, they are poking
into your background.

59:23.197 --> 59:24.796
We don't have nothin'
to be ashamed of!

59:24.931 --> 59:26.561
Now, my daddy is a good man.

59:26.696 --> 59:29.804
Yes, yes.
But your papa did go to jail.

59:29.940 --> 59:32.909
You know them,
and their flashy headlines.

59:33.044 --> 59:36.972
"Elvis, The Draft Dodger."
"A Family of Delinquents."

59:37.107 --> 59:40.206
<i>There was no moon</i>

59:40.342 --> 59:44.044
We may never
book another date,
or sell another record again.

59:44.180 --> 59:45.779
And my way of thinking,

59:45.915 --> 59:48.258
the army could be
a brand new start
for all of us.

59:48.394 --> 59:50.159
<i>Let them cut your hair.</i>

59:50.294 --> 59:53.426
Prove to the world that you are
a clean-cut, all-American boy.

59:53.561 --> 59:56.491
<i>You do your two years, and when</i>
<i>you come back, I promise you</i>

59:56.626 --> 59:58.131
<i>I will have done</i>
<i>everything I can</i>

59:58.266 --> 1:00:00.966
<i>to make you the biggest</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood.</i>

1:00:01.101 --> 1:00:02.739
You will choose
your own pictures.

1:00:04.776 --> 1:00:06.238
-It's gonna be okay, Mama.

1:00:06.373 --> 1:00:10.742
<i>And I pulled Mr. Crawfish</i>
<i>out of his hole</i>

1:00:10.877 --> 1:00:12.608
<i>Young Mr. Presley,</i>
<i>a rock and roller no more.</i>

1:00:12.744 --> 1:00:15.979
<i>He'll do six months'</i>
<i>basic training at Fort Chaffee</i>

1:00:16.114 --> 1:00:18.048
<i>before shipping off to Germany.</i>

1:00:19.957 --> 1:00:21.548
<i> Since the day</i>
<i>he was born,</i>

1:00:21.683 --> 1:00:24.288
<i>she had feared</i>
<i>losing her second son.</i>

1:00:27.866 --> 1:00:30.030
<i>While he was</i>
<i>in basic training...</i>

1:00:31.096 --> 1:00:33.429
<i>she worried and drank...</i>

1:00:34.933 --> 1:00:36.366
<i>Worried...</i>

1:00:37.342 --> 1:00:39.004
<i>and drank.</i>

1:00:47.110 --> 1:00:48.413
Hey...

1:00:48.549 --> 1:00:49.753
Alberta!

1:01:13.511 --> 1:01:15.803
Oh, no...

1:01:15.939 --> 1:01:17.407
No!

1:01:21.252 --> 1:01:25.879
There are some fine folks
from the press waiting outside.

1:01:26.015 --> 1:01:30.857
A few questions, pictures,
and they will leave us alone.

1:01:30.992 --> 1:01:33.863
I can't get him to do anything.

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:38.098
He trusted her
like nobody else,

1:01:38.234 --> 1:01:41.838
and now she's gone
and who does he have now?

1:01:43.869 --> 1:01:44.742
Well...

1:01:46.338 --> 1:01:48.102
He trusts you.

1:01:48.238 --> 1:01:50.242
Can you talk to him?

1:01:51.381 --> 1:01:53.212
Oh, no.

1:01:54.376 --> 1:01:56.242
It's not my place...

1:01:56.378 --> 1:01:58.080
Can you do it, Colonel?

1:01:58.215 --> 1:02:00.054
We need your help now.

1:02:10.496 --> 1:02:13.095
Your daddy is doing
the best he knows how,

1:02:13.230 --> 1:02:16.264
but he is overwhelmed.

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.571
He needs your help out there.

1:02:18.706 --> 1:02:22.402
I can't go out there.
I just wanna stay here forever.

1:02:22.538 --> 1:02:24.648
-Oh, my boy.

1:02:24.783 --> 1:02:27.846
No one could never
replace her.

1:02:27.981 --> 1:02:30.085
But you listen to me.

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:33.285
From this moment on,
anything she would have done...

1:02:34.319 --> 1:02:37.256
I will carry out, in her name.

1:02:37.392 --> 1:02:42.622
When you are overseas,
I will stay here at home.

1:02:42.758 --> 1:02:46.100
And I will work,
and I will worry.

1:02:48.131 --> 1:02:49.763
Trust me.

1:02:52.076 --> 1:02:56.169
Now, you go and you stand
by your papa.

1:02:56.304 --> 1:02:57.540
You comfort him.

1:02:58.449 --> 1:03:00.343
You comfort him.

1:03:00.479 --> 1:03:02.550
Comfort your friends
and your family,

1:03:02.686 --> 1:03:04.720
and even your fans. Hmm?

1:03:04.855 --> 1:03:08.188
Because if you don't do that...

1:03:08.323 --> 1:03:11.152
all that your mama
has sacrificed for you

1:03:11.288 --> 1:03:13.028
will be for nothing.

1:03:17.131 --> 1:03:18.496
No matter what happens,

1:03:18.631 --> 1:03:21.166
you stay with me
through thick and thin, okay?

1:03:21.302 --> 1:03:24.470
You're like a...
like a father to me.

1:03:59.572 --> 1:04:02.440
<i> I needed</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:07.577
<i>Even from himself.</i>

1:04:12.948 --> 1:04:16.922
<i>My plan, Elvis Presley</i>
<i>would return</i>

1:04:17.058 --> 1:04:21.327
<i>a clean-cut, all-American boy.</i>

1:04:22.829 --> 1:04:23.901
<i>But...</i>

1:04:26.397 --> 1:04:27.696
<i>...I did not consider</i>

1:04:27.831 --> 1:04:30.237
<i>the most dangerous thing</i>
<i>of all.</i>

1:04:32.774 --> 1:04:34.704
<i>Love.</i>

1:04:44.752 --> 1:04:47.188
<i> Priscilla,</i>
<i>the pretty teenage daughter</i>

1:04:47.324 --> 1:04:50.719
<i>of a United States</i>
<i>Air Force officer.</i>

1:04:53.193 --> 1:04:55.123
And then he said to me...

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:58.295
"You know what, Priscilla?

1:04:58.431 --> 1:05:00.126
You gotta listen to me,
sweetie,

1:05:00.262 --> 1:05:02.731
because this guy, he's got
girls all over the world, okay?

1:05:02.866 --> 1:05:04.403
He's got girls waiting
outside of his house

1:05:04.538 --> 1:05:06.333
and girls writing him
endless fan mail."

1:05:06.468 --> 1:05:08.672
And then Mommy decides
to pitch in and go,

1:05:08.807 --> 1:05:10.980
"Ooh, what could he possibly
see in you, okay?

1:05:11.116 --> 1:05:12.878
What do you two do
up there all night?"

1:05:13.013 --> 1:05:14.380
-And--

1:05:16.349 --> 1:05:19.045
And I just said, "Mom, Dad...

1:05:19.181 --> 1:05:22.391
we talk and we listen
to music, okay? That's all."

1:05:22.526 --> 1:05:24.820
And then they were going on
and on about that photo of you

1:05:24.956 --> 1:05:27.424
and Natalie Wood riding around
on that bike in Memphis,

1:05:27.559 --> 1:05:29.925
and...
and then what I said...

1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:33.301
And I said this really calmly,
I said, "Listen, okay?

1:05:33.436 --> 1:05:37.634
He's just really lonely.
And quite frankly, so am I."

1:05:39.774 --> 1:05:42.275
And then
they didn't really know
what to say after that,

1:05:42.410 --> 1:05:45.747
so I went upstairs
and I went to bed.

1:05:45.883 --> 1:05:48.309
Never met anyone like you.

1:05:48.444 --> 1:05:49.613
Well, I hope not.

1:05:51.991 --> 1:05:54.992
So... what
is Natalie Wood like?

1:05:56.288 --> 1:05:57.785
She's nice, you know.

1:05:57.920 --> 1:05:59.522
She's been writing me
about acting.

1:05:59.658 --> 1:06:01.830
I've been asking her
stories about...

1:06:01.966 --> 1:06:04.025
working with James Dean and...

1:06:04.161 --> 1:06:06.302
God, I just hope to one day
be as good as him, you know?

1:06:06.438 --> 1:06:07.367
Mmm.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.774
Colonel's promised me
that when I get back

1:06:14.909 --> 1:06:17.278
he's gonna set me up
in Hollywood
to be a serious actor.

1:06:20.446 --> 1:06:23.879
That's really what I dream of.

1:06:24.014 --> 1:06:27.219
Hey, E.P., E.P.,
now, you promised the captain

1:06:27.355 --> 1:06:29.816
that you'd get her home
by- 00.

1:06:29.952 --> 1:06:31.758
Hey, Charlie.
What's that behind you?

1:06:31.893 --> 1:06:33.393
What? No...

1:06:34.623 --> 1:06:36.429
He don't boss me around.

1:06:51.349 --> 1:06:53.743
You know, I think
if you dream it, you'll do it.

1:06:55.278 --> 1:06:56.383
You do?

1:06:57.819 --> 1:07:00.357
Yeah.

1:07:02.221 --> 1:07:06.360
<i>Shall I stay?</i>

1:07:08.162 --> 1:07:13.532
<i>Would it be a sin</i>

1:07:16.037 --> 1:07:21.701
<i>If I can't help</i>

1:07:21.837 --> 1:07:28.118
<i>Falling in love with you?</i>

1:07:32.580 --> 1:07:34.281
<i> You no longer</i>
<i>want to sing in your films,</i>

1:07:34.416 --> 1:07:36.491
<i>is that right?</i>
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>a dramatic actor.</i>

1:07:36.627 --> 1:07:38.624
<i> Well, sir, that's</i>
<i>my big ambition now.</i>

1:07:38.759 --> 1:07:41.790
<i>It takes a lot of time,</i>
<i>a lot of experience.</i>

1:07:41.925 --> 1:07:45.797
<i> He was</i>
<i>as good as Brando.</i>

1:07:45.933 --> 1:07:50.140
<i>But you didn't want to see him</i>
<i>in movies where he didn't sing.</i>

1:07:50.275 --> 1:07:51.774
<i>A little less conversation</i>

1:07:51.910 --> 1:07:54.443
<i>A little more action</i>

1:07:54.578 --> 1:07:58.581
<i>All this aggravation</i>
<i>Ain't satisfactioning me</i>

1:07:58.716 --> 1:08:04.781
<i> Thanks to me, his life</i>
<i>became one big Hollywood movie!</i>

1:08:05.957 --> 1:08:07.588
<i>Starring Priscilla...</i>

1:08:07.724 --> 1:08:09.826
<i> Bright light city</i>
<i>gonna set my soul</i>

1:08:09.962 --> 1:08:12.362
<i>Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

1:08:12.498 --> 1:08:15.798
<i> And a cast</i>
<i>of his "buddies" and "cousins."</i>

1:08:15.933 --> 1:08:17.793
<i>His Memphis Mafia.</i>

1:08:17.929 --> 1:08:19.966
<i>So get those stakes</i>
<i>up higher</i>

1:08:20.101 --> 1:08:23.899
<i>There's a thousand</i>
<i>pretty women</i>
<i>Waitin' out there</i>

1:08:24.035 --> 1:08:27.001
<i>And they're all livin'</i>
<i>The devil may care</i>

1:08:27.137 --> 1:08:30.405
<i>And I'm just the devil</i>
<i>With love to spare, so</i>

1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:33.150
<i>Viva, Las Vegas</i>

1:08:34.782 --> 1:08:36.979
<i> There was that</i>
<i>fairytale wedding.</i>

1:08:37.114 --> 1:08:39.848
<i>And the honeymoon</i>
<i>on Frank Sinatra's jet.</i>

1:08:39.983 --> 1:08:44.154
<i>And introducing</i>
<i>Baby Lisa Marie.</i>

1:08:44.289 --> 1:08:49.062
<i>I made him the highest paid</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood history.</i>

1:08:49.198 --> 1:08:50.662
<i>We had a lot of fun!</i>

1:08:52.169 --> 1:08:54.368
<i>But Elvis was a young man,</i>

1:08:54.503 --> 1:08:56.865
<i>and of course,</i>
<i>he got distracted.</i>

1:08:57.001 --> 1:09:02.003
<i>So we made them faster</i>
<i>and cheaper.</i>

1:09:02.139 --> 1:09:03.843
<i>Beatlemania sweeps America,</i>

1:09:03.978 --> 1:09:06.711
<i>as teens turn their attention</i>
<i>to the teenage rockers.</i>

1:09:08.783 --> 1:09:11.214
<i> Is it my fault</i>
<i>the world changed?</i>

1:09:14.989 --> 1:09:17.451
<i> Good evening.</i>
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,</i>

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:20.527
<i>the apostle of non-violence</i>
<i>in the Civil Rights movement,</i>

1:09:20.663 --> 1:09:22.957
<i>has been shot to death</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

1:09:39.541 --> 1:09:42.275
<i> New Elvis stinker</i>
<i>bombs, another flop.</i>

1:09:42.411 --> 1:09:45.784
<i>There's no more appetite</i>
<i>for Presley pictures.</i>

1:09:45.919 --> 1:09:48.423
<i> It don't matter</i>
<i>how hard I worked,</i>

1:09:48.558 --> 1:09:51.290
<i>how many snow jobs</i>
<i>I came up with,</i>

1:09:51.426 --> 1:09:53.390
<i>how much snow I made them.</i>

1:09:53.525 --> 1:09:55.761
<i>My boy loved to spend.</i>

1:09:55.896 --> 1:09:58.396
<i>And with them hillbillies</i>
<i>around him,</i>

1:09:58.531 --> 1:10:01.600
<i>the money would just melt away.</i>

1:10:01.736 --> 1:10:04.304
With the sale of the ranch
and the horses,

1:10:04.439 --> 1:10:05.801
that's gonna cover the payroll,

1:10:05.937 --> 1:10:08.168
but as for the security
at Graceland...

1:10:08.304 --> 1:10:10.071
<i>Officers also reportedly chased</i>

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:11.838
<i>and fired on</i>
<i>a radio-equipped car</i>

1:10:11.974 --> 1:10:13.778
<i>containing two white men.</i>

1:10:13.913 --> 1:10:16.078
<i>Dr. King was standing</i>
<i>on the balcony</i>

1:10:16.213 --> 1:10:18.383
<i>of his second floor</i>
<i>hotel room tonight,</i>

1:10:18.518 --> 1:10:20.356
<i>when, according to a companion,</i>

1:10:20.492 --> 1:10:22.787
<i>a shot was fired</i>
<i>from across the street.</i>

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:24.721
Dr. King.

1:10:24.857 --> 1:10:25.719
Uncle Vernon,
come quick!

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:27.060
He always spoke the truth.

1:10:27.196 --> 1:10:29.028
What happened?

1:10:29.163 --> 1:10:30.961
<i>They rushed the 39-year-old</i>
<i>Negro leader to a hospital,</i>

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:33.632
<i>where he died of a bullet wound</i>
<i>in the neck.</i>

1:10:33.768 --> 1:10:35.195
<i>Jingle, jingles...</i>

1:10:35.331 --> 1:10:37.535
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1:10:37.670 --> 1:10:39.937
<i>Right down Santa Claus Lane</i>

1:10:40.072 --> 1:10:41.977
<i>Vixen and Blitzen</i>
<i>And all the reindeer</i>

1:10:42.113 --> 1:10:43.644
<i>Pulling on the rein</i>

1:10:43.779 --> 1:10:45.848
Elvis Presley's
<i>Wonderful World of Christmas.</i>

1:10:45.983 --> 1:10:47.007
Brought to you by

1:10:47.143 --> 1:10:48.943
the Singer Sewing Machine
Company,

1:10:49.079 --> 1:10:51.153
to every television set
in America.

1:10:51.288 --> 1:10:53.185
It only takes three days
to tape,

1:10:53.321 --> 1:10:54.287
and there's no audience.

1:10:54.423 --> 1:10:56.153
<i>Violence breeds violence,</i>

1:10:56.289 --> 1:10:57.921
<i>-repression breeds retaliation.</i>
-...Christmas sweater.

1:10:58.057 --> 1:11:01.256
Made on the new Singer,
home knitting apparatus.

1:11:01.391 --> 1:11:04.432
-Memphis is burning.
<i>-...and to fear his brother.</i>

1:11:04.568 --> 1:11:06.997
<i>When you teach</i>
<i>that he is a lesser man</i>

1:11:07.132 --> 1:11:09.669
<i>because of his color</i>
<i>or his beliefs...</i>

1:11:09.804 --> 1:11:11.572
...dreaming
of a white Christmas,

1:11:11.707 --> 1:11:14.801
because, oh,
it's definitely going to snow.

1:11:14.937 --> 1:11:16.609
Christmas special.

1:11:16.744 --> 1:11:18.677
Is this the best we can do,
Admiral?

1:11:18.812 --> 1:11:20.774
Well, we took
the Hollywood phonies

1:11:20.910 --> 1:11:22.342
for every nickel they had

1:11:22.477 --> 1:11:24.749
and now it is time
for us to pack up our tents

1:11:24.885 --> 1:11:26.781
and move on
to even greener pastures.

1:11:26.917 --> 1:11:28.455
We've seen "Elvis the Rebel,"

1:11:28.590 --> 1:11:30.327
we've seen
"Elvis the Movie Star."

1:11:30.462 --> 1:11:33.962
Now we will see
"Elvis the Family Entertainer."

1:11:34.098 --> 1:11:35.530
And appliance salesman?

1:11:37.826 --> 1:11:39.764
What did you say?

1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:42.298
Listen, Jerry,
I don't need you to question me

1:11:42.434 --> 1:11:45.501
about how I support my family
and every goddamn person here.

1:11:45.636 --> 1:11:47.169
You understand me?

1:11:47.305 --> 1:11:49.038
If you don't like it,
you can go back to Memphis.

1:11:51.346 --> 1:11:52.910
Laugh it up, assholes.

1:12:09.193 --> 1:12:10.665
<i> What</i>
<i>a beautiful rendition</i>

1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:13.032
<i>of "Here Comes Santa Claus"</i>
<i>that was,</i>

1:12:13.167 --> 1:12:16.473
<i>with all the sparkle and magic</i>
<i>that the season brings.</i>

1:12:16.608 --> 1:12:18.508
<i>And you'll be even warmer</i>
<i>this season</i>

1:12:18.643 --> 1:12:21.075
<i>in a 12 gauge</i>
<i>cable-knit woolen sweater...</i>

1:12:21.210 --> 1:12:23.409
-Satnin?
-Hi.

1:12:23.545 --> 1:12:25.575
<i>...made right at home</i>
<i>on the Singer Sewer</i>
<i>SK155 home knitter.</i>

1:12:25.710 --> 1:12:28.213
<i>And now, here's Elvis!</i>

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.219
Can I watch the memorial
with you?

1:12:34.354 --> 1:12:35.689
Yeah, baby.

1:12:43.126 --> 1:12:46.201
I'm so tired of playing
Elvis Presley.

1:12:46.336 --> 1:12:48.696
Too many people rely on me.

1:12:52.075 --> 1:12:53.703
I love you.

1:12:53.838 --> 1:12:55.610
And your daughter loves you.

1:12:58.276 --> 1:13:00.380
We don't care about the money
or anything else.

1:13:00.516 --> 1:13:02.209
We just want you to be happy.

1:13:02.344 --> 1:13:04.053
<i>Lord, hold my hand</i>

1:13:04.189 --> 1:13:05.887
<i>And don't let me fall</i>

1:13:06.022 --> 1:13:09.453
You're only really happy when
you sing the music you love.

1:13:09.588 --> 1:13:13.490
<i> Oh</i>

1:13:13.625 --> 1:13:16.889
<i>Take my hand</i>

1:13:17.025 --> 1:13:19.798
Mahalia Jackson.

1:13:19.934 --> 1:13:22.605
I used to hear her sing
at East Street Church.

1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:25.968
<i>Got a feelin' in my body</i>

1:13:26.104 --> 1:13:28.100
That's the music
that makes me happy.

1:13:28.236 --> 1:13:33.714
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1:13:33.850 --> 1:13:38.311
So when things are too
dangerous to say... sing!

1:13:43.795 --> 1:13:48.832
<i>When Moses walked the children</i>
<i>out of Egypt land</i>

1:13:48.967 --> 1:13:53.334
<i>He said "Now don't you worry</i>
<i>we're in the lord's hands"</i>

1:13:53.470 --> 1:13:57.305
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

1:13:57.441 --> 1:14:00.510
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1:14:04.012 --> 1:14:07.976
<i>We'll be released</i>
<i>from all our sorrow</i>

1:14:08.111 --> 1:14:11.213
<i>Leave it layin' along the way</i>

1:14:19.492 --> 1:14:22.357
<i> You gotta meet these</i>
<i>Binder and Bones guys, E.P.</i>

1:14:22.492 --> 1:14:23.662
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>that put James Brown,</i>

1:14:23.797 --> 1:14:26.295
<i>the Rolling Stones onstage.</i>

1:14:26.430 --> 1:14:28.097
<i>They're doing some</i>
<i>cutting edge stuff.</i>

1:14:28.233 --> 1:14:32.366
Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe...
thanks for coming.

1:14:48.685 --> 1:14:50.884
When I first came
to Hollywood, I'd come up here

1:14:51.019 --> 1:14:53.253
and sit for hours.

1:14:53.389 --> 1:14:55.059
Right over there,
the observatory...

1:14:55.195 --> 1:14:57.900
that's where they shot
<i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

1:14:58.036 --> 1:15:02.997
Man, I used to dream of being
a great actor like Jimmy Dean.

1:15:03.133 --> 1:15:05.201
This sign was beautiful then.

1:15:07.474 --> 1:15:09.339
And now...

1:15:09.475 --> 1:15:12.345
Feels as though lots of things
are like that these days.

1:15:12.481 --> 1:15:15.409
Broke down, beat up.

1:15:16.251 --> 1:15:17.246
Rotten.

1:15:19.415 --> 1:15:21.349
I really like
what you guys did,

1:15:21.484 --> 1:15:23.921
putting James Brown
and the Stones together.

1:15:24.057 --> 1:15:27.488
We're, uh...
big fans of yours, too.

1:15:27.623 --> 1:15:30.032
It's just that, Mr. Presley,
we don't usually--

1:15:30.167 --> 1:15:31.429
Oh, Elvis.

1:15:31.564 --> 1:15:32.998
Elvis, uh...

1:15:34.629 --> 1:15:37.268
Christmas specials
aren't really our thing.

1:15:37.404 --> 1:15:38.608
I know.

1:15:40.509 --> 1:15:42.778
Tell me, honestly...

1:15:42.913 --> 1:15:45.274
where do you boys
think my career's at right now?

1:15:47.218 --> 1:15:48.910
Well, it's...

1:15:49.046 --> 1:15:51.753
It's in the toilet, Elvis.

1:15:57.394 --> 1:15:59.928
You hear that, Jerry?

1:16:00.064 --> 1:16:03.259
Oh, Lord. I knew you were
the right guys for this job.

1:16:03.394 --> 1:16:05.733
You know,
back when I was starting out,

1:16:05.868 --> 1:16:08.264
some people wanted
to put me in jail,

1:16:08.399 --> 1:16:11.564
even kill me,
'cause of the way I was moving.

1:16:13.773 --> 1:16:15.337
So they cut my hair,

1:16:15.473 --> 1:16:18.340
they put me in uniform
and they sent me away.

1:16:21.319 --> 1:16:22.982
That killed my mother.

1:16:26.181 --> 1:16:27.954
And ever since then...

1:16:29.754 --> 1:16:30.990
I've been lost.

1:16:33.425 --> 1:16:36.160
And when you're lost,
people take advantage.

1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:42.595
I need you fellas to help me
get back to who I really am.

1:16:43.869 --> 1:16:45.103
And who are you, Elvis?

1:16:47.804 --> 1:16:49.840
I sure as hell ain't somebody
who sings Christmas songs

1:16:49.975 --> 1:16:52.780
by a fireplace for an hour.

1:16:52.915 --> 1:16:55.377
And what
does the Colonel think?

1:16:55.512 --> 1:16:57.786
I don't give a damn
what the Colonel thinks.

1:17:13.001 --> 1:17:14.662
For this television special,

1:17:14.798 --> 1:17:17.468
we've got this Bindle fella,
number one hotshot director.

1:17:17.603 --> 1:17:20.373
Elvis will be humoring him by
doing a few of his fresh ideas.

1:17:20.508 --> 1:17:22.072
Ah, the sweater!

1:17:22.208 --> 1:17:24.804
To Mr. Presley's
dressing room, please.

1:17:24.940 --> 1:17:28.309
We are going to sing three
spectacular Christmas songs

1:17:28.445 --> 1:17:30.511
-in that very sweater.

1:17:32.450 --> 1:17:35.481
Now, when that sign lights up,
what do you do?

1:17:35.616 --> 1:17:37.056
-Applause.

1:17:40.965 --> 1:17:43.324
"Silent is the Night"
and "Deck the Halls,"

1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:46.802
and, uh...
"Whose Child Is This?"

1:17:46.938 --> 1:17:48.836
<i> You think</i>
<i>we can do some gospel?</i>

1:17:48.971 --> 1:17:50.505
Well, if you want
to find yourself,

1:17:50.641 --> 1:17:52.238
first thing you do is go home.

1:17:52.374 --> 1:17:55.773
Metaphorically, you know.
Get back to who you really are.

1:17:55.909 --> 1:17:57.873
And what is the boy that--

1:17:58.008 --> 1:17:59.546
-Oh, "The Little Drummer Boy"?
-Yes, "The Little
Drumming Boy."

1:17:59.681 --> 1:18:01.246
Oh, the... with the...

1:18:01.381 --> 1:18:03.282
<i> We get your old band</i>
<i>back together.</i>

1:18:03.418 --> 1:18:07.181
But we are going to start with
"Here Comes Santa Claus,"

1:18:07.317 --> 1:18:09.089
isn't that right, Mr. Bindle?

1:18:09.224 --> 1:18:10.623
Uh, the Christmas specials
come later in the show.

1:18:10.758 --> 1:18:12.125
Can you bring up two?

1:18:12.260 --> 1:18:14.196
<i> A leather jacket.</i>
<i>Raw, dirty.</i>

1:18:14.331 --> 1:18:17.358
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
this is television, not radio,

1:18:17.494 --> 1:18:18.964
so when that goes up
and you clap,

1:18:19.100 --> 1:18:20.225
let's see it
on your faces as well.

1:18:21.829 --> 1:18:23.031
<i> But you need</i>
<i>an audience.</i>

1:18:23.166 --> 1:18:24.731
<i> Audience?</i>

1:18:24.866 --> 1:18:26.669
-Bring it over to one.
-<i> At any second now,</i>

1:18:26.804 --> 1:18:28.672
Elvis is gonna walk onto this
stage and perform just for you.

1:18:28.807 --> 1:18:30.874
<i> I ain't sang in front</i>
<i>of an audience in a long time.</i>

1:18:31.010 --> 1:18:32.408
<i> That's my point.</i>

1:18:32.544 --> 1:18:35.548
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Elvis Presley!

1:19:13.581 --> 1:19:16.254
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

1:19:16.389 --> 1:19:18.917
<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

1:19:19.053 --> 1:19:20.957
<i>Well, it's down at the end</i>
<i>Of Lonely Street</i>

1:19:21.093 --> 1:19:23.426
<i>At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

1:19:23.561 --> 1:19:27.029
<i>Where I'll be</i>
<i>I'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1:19:27.164 --> 1:19:29.464
<i>I'll be so lonely</i>

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:33.437
<i>I'll be so lonely</i>
<i>I could die</i>

1:19:33.572 --> 1:19:36.637
<i>Well, the bellhop's tears</i>
<i>Keep flowin'</i>

1:19:36.773 --> 1:19:39.311
<i>And the desk clerk's</i>
<i>Dressed in black</i>

1:19:39.447 --> 1:19:41.808
<i>Well, they've been so long</i>
<i>On Lonely Street</i>

1:19:41.943 --> 1:19:45.587
<i>Well, they'll never</i>
<i>They'll never look back</i>

1:19:45.723 --> 1:19:47.753
<i>They'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1:19:47.889 --> 1:19:50.353
<i>They'll be so lonely</i>

1:19:50.489 --> 1:19:52.758
<i>They'll be so lonely</i>
<i>They could die</i>

1:19:56.161 --> 1:19:59.528
Well, that was... energetic.

1:20:01.698 --> 1:20:04.330
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

1:20:04.466 --> 1:20:06.402
<i>Snoopin' at my door</i>

1:20:06.538 --> 1:20:09.038
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

1:20:09.174 --> 1:20:11.705
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:13.473
<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

1:20:13.608 --> 1:20:16.215
<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

1:20:16.947 --> 1:20:17.920
Come on!

1:20:19.357 --> 1:20:21.350
Colonel...

1:20:21.486 --> 1:20:23.556
Is "Here Comes
Santa Claus" next?

1:20:23.691 --> 1:20:25.251
Absolutely.

1:20:25.387 --> 1:20:27.888
I see no reason why not.

1:20:28.024 --> 1:20:31.628
He's not in the swe-- he's not
even wearing the sweater.

1:20:31.763 --> 1:20:34.728
<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

1:20:34.863 --> 1:20:36.830
<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

1:20:36.966 --> 1:20:41.337
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

1:20:41.473 --> 1:20:43.544
I do not know
what is going on.

1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:44.979
Singing "Hound Dog"?

1:20:45.115 --> 1:20:46.916
What does that have to do
with Christmas?

1:20:47.051 --> 1:20:49.512
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

1:20:49.647 --> 1:20:52.053
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Baby</i>

1:20:52.188 --> 1:20:54.020
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

1:20:54.156 --> 1:20:56.020
<i>Blue, blue</i>
<i>blue suede shoes</i>

1:20:56.156 --> 1:20:57.586
<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

1:20:57.721 --> 1:21:00.028
<i>But lay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

1:21:04.393 --> 1:21:06.091
Young man, you tell them

1:21:06.227 --> 1:21:07.933
it's time for "Here Comes
Santa Claus." I said so. Now!

1:21:08.068 --> 1:21:09.862
All right. First positions!

1:21:12.671 --> 1:21:15.067
<i>Warden threw a party</i>
<i>In the county jail</i>

1:21:15.202 --> 1:21:17.575
<i>The prison band was there</i>
<i>And they began to wail</i>

1:21:17.711 --> 1:21:20.613
<i>The band was jumping</i>
<i>And the joint began to swing</i>

1:21:20.749 --> 1:21:22.714
<i>You shoulda heard</i>
<i>Those knocked out</i>
<i>jailbirds sing</i>

1:21:22.849 --> 1:21:27.219
<i>Let's rock</i>
<i>All right, everybody,</i>
<i>let's rock</i>

1:21:27.354 --> 1:21:30.156
<i>Everybody in the whole</i>
<i>Cell block</i>

1:21:30.291 --> 1:21:32.758
<i>Was dancing to the</i>
<i>Jailhouse Rock</i>

1:21:32.893 --> 1:21:37.763
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1:21:37.898 --> 1:21:41.733
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1:21:43.036 --> 1:21:45.739
<i>They were dancin'</i>

1:21:45.875 --> 1:21:47.972
<i>Well, they were dancin'</i>

1:21:48.108 --> 1:21:50.938
<i>To the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1:21:51.074 --> 1:21:52.575
Hah!

1:21:53.275 --> 1:21:54.742
All right.

1:22:00.857 --> 1:22:03.788
It's been a long time, baby.

1:22:03.923 --> 1:22:05.489
A long time.

1:22:21.939 --> 1:22:23.475
<i> Well, I like a lot</i>
<i>of the new groups,</i>

1:22:23.611 --> 1:22:26.846
<i>you know, the Beatles</i>
<i>and the Byrds, but,</i>

1:22:26.982 --> 1:22:29.843
a lot of it is basically--

1:22:29.978 --> 1:22:31.984
rock and roll music
is basically, uh...

1:22:32.119 --> 1:22:34.289
gospel or rhythm and blues.

1:22:34.425 --> 1:22:38.325
Well, that's one thing about
this TV special that I'm doing,

1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:41.159
<i>they're gonna let me do</i>
<i>what I want to do.</i>

1:22:41.294 --> 1:22:43.356
<i>Sing the music that I want.</i>

1:22:43.491 --> 1:22:45.034
Music that I love.

1:22:47.563 --> 1:22:49.533
Music that makes me happy.

1:22:55.744 --> 1:23:00.149
<i> Those know-it-all</i>
<i>hippies had brainwashed Elvis,</i>

1:23:00.284 --> 1:23:02.811
<i>acting like he was</i>
<i>one of them radicals,</i>

1:23:02.947 --> 1:23:05.677
<i>throwing his career away</i>
<i>to sing spirituals</i>

1:23:05.813 --> 1:23:07.320
<i>with a bunch of longhairs.</i>

1:23:15.357 --> 1:23:17.057
Bindle...

1:23:17.193 --> 1:23:18.600
-Cue the gospel number now. Go.
-"Here Comes Santa Claus."

1:23:18.736 --> 1:23:20.593
<i>Up above my head</i>

1:23:22.973 --> 1:23:25.604
<i>There is music in the air</i>

1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:26.839
No.

1:23:26.975 --> 1:23:28.737
<i>Up above my head</i>

1:23:31.039 --> 1:23:33.380
All right, none of this
will be in the special.

1:23:33.516 --> 1:23:35.612
Can you make a note that
that should be in the special?

1:23:37.754 --> 1:23:41.380
Okay, now let's segue straight
into the whorehouse dancers.
Go!

1:23:41.515 --> 1:23:43.686
Whorehouse? No.

1:23:46.361 --> 1:23:48.597
Now bring in
the kung fu spectacular.

1:23:48.733 --> 1:23:51.928
What? Kung fu?

1:23:52.063 --> 1:23:54.036
<i>If you ever take a trip</i>
<i>Down to the ocean</i>

1:23:54.171 --> 1:23:56.931
<i>Find yourself down</i>
<i>around Mobile</i>

1:23:57.067 --> 1:23:59.404
This has nothing
to do with Christmas!

1:23:59.539 --> 1:24:01.671
You'll be hearing
from our lawyers.

1:24:01.807 --> 1:24:03.375
But, we still have
"Here Comes Santa Claus"!

1:24:03.511 --> 1:24:05.610
Santa Claus is bringing you
a lawsuit!

1:24:05.745 --> 1:24:06.938
<i>Digging the finest</i>
<i>Little five-piece group</i>

1:24:07.074 --> 1:24:09.042
<i>Up and down the</i>
<i>Gulf of Mexico</i>

1:24:09.177 --> 1:24:10.917
<i>Guess who's leading</i>
<i>That five-piece band</i>

1:24:11.053 --> 1:24:12.451
<i>Well, wouldn't you know</i>

1:24:12.587 --> 1:24:14.313
<i>It's that swinging little</i>
<i>Guitar man</i>

1:24:14.449 --> 1:24:18.953
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1:24:19.088 --> 1:24:22.660
<i>Just put your arms around me</i>
<i>Real tight</i>

1:24:22.795 --> 1:24:25.726
<i>We'll be released</i>
<i>From all our sorrow</i>

1:24:25.862 --> 1:24:27.967
<i>Leave it layin'</i>
<i>along the way</i>

1:24:28.102 --> 1:24:31.800
<i>Well, I'm the king</i>
<i>of the jungle</i>
<i>They call me the Tiger Man</i>

1:24:31.936 --> 1:24:35.668
<i>I got a--</i>
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

1:24:35.804 --> 1:24:37.646
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1:24:40.943 --> 1:24:42.714
Bobby Kennedy been shot!

1:24:42.849 --> 1:24:44.715
Bobby Kennedy's
been shot, everybody!

1:24:44.850 --> 1:24:47.146
<i> Senator Kennedy</i>
<i>has been shot.</i>

1:24:47.281 --> 1:24:50.586
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Senator Kennedy has been shot.</i>

1:24:52.693 --> 1:24:54.628
<i>Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

1:24:54.764 --> 1:24:57.094
<i>Take a hold of his thumb</i>
<i>and break it if you have to!</i>

1:24:57.229 --> 1:24:58.458
<i>Get his gun!</i>

1:24:58.594 --> 1:24:59.960
We're ready on set.

1:25:02.035 --> 1:25:03.233
Oh, my God.

1:25:13.247 --> 1:25:16.809
<i>...Senator Kennedy</i>
<i>was involved in a shooting,</i>

1:25:16.944 --> 1:25:18.978
<i>that a newsman was involved,</i>

1:25:19.113 --> 1:25:20.952
<i>and that one other man</i>
<i>was involved.</i>

1:25:21.087 --> 1:25:24.051
<i>There are now three doctors</i>
<i>back there caring for them.</i>

1:25:24.187 --> 1:25:26.056
Steve, we gotta
get back to work.

1:25:26.192 --> 1:25:28.192
Work?

1:25:28.328 --> 1:25:29.491
<i>...amount of blood on the floor</i>
<i>of this anteroom.</i>

1:25:29.626 --> 1:25:32.459
<i>Ice is now being, uh, brought--</i>

1:25:35.665 --> 1:25:38.240
Listen, I, uh...

1:25:39.768 --> 1:25:41.038
I just want to say that...

1:25:42.607 --> 1:25:44.846
...that this nation is hurting.

1:25:44.982 --> 1:25:47.314
It's lost. You know? It...

1:25:47.450 --> 1:25:51.319
It needs a voice right now
to help it heal.

1:25:53.485 --> 1:25:55.114
We have to say something.

1:25:56.253 --> 1:25:57.785
You...

1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.788
have to make
a statement, E.P.

1:26:00.924 --> 1:26:04.494
Mr. Presley does not
make statements.

1:26:04.629 --> 1:26:08.462
He sings
"Here Comes Santa Claus"

1:26:08.598 --> 1:26:10.170
and wishes everyone,

1:26:10.305 --> 1:26:12.835
"Merry Christmas
and good night."

1:26:15.039 --> 1:26:16.510
<i>...Senator Kennedy's</i>
<i>press secretary</i>

1:26:16.645 --> 1:26:18.744
<i>was made roughly an hour</i>
<i>and a half ago.</i>

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:21.745
<i>Some five to ten minutes later,</i>
<i>the operation began.</i>

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:24.253
<i>The six-man team</i>
<i>of neurosurgeons</i>

1:26:24.388 --> 1:26:25.746
<i>probing for the bullet</i>
<i>that had lodged</i>

1:26:25.881 --> 1:26:27.554
<i>in Senator Kennedy's brain.</i>

1:26:27.690 --> 1:26:29.925
<i>No report yet</i>
<i>as to how that operation...</i>

1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:32.085
Poor Mrs. Kennedy.

1:26:32.862 --> 1:26:33.889
This tragedy...

1:26:34.864 --> 1:26:36.890
A tragedy.

1:26:37.026 --> 1:26:39.360
But it has nothing
to do with us.

1:26:39.495 --> 1:26:42.961
<i> The White House</i>
<i>has reacted to the shooting...</i>

1:26:43.097 --> 1:26:45.235
It has everything
to do with us.

1:26:45.371 --> 1:26:48.774
No, I just do not think

1:26:48.910 --> 1:26:52.039
we should be making speeches
about politics and religion.

1:26:52.175 --> 1:26:54.712
Dr. King was shot
eight miles from Graceland

1:26:54.847 --> 1:26:58.420
while I was out here
singing to turtles.

1:26:58.556 --> 1:27:00.681
And now this, and all you can
think about is how many

1:27:00.816 --> 1:27:02.883
goddamn sweaters I can sell?

1:27:03.018 --> 1:27:04.854
I am a promoter.
That is what I do.

1:27:04.989 --> 1:27:07.286
And I'm Elvis Presley.
That's what I do.

1:27:07.421 --> 1:27:10.065
Well, Mr. Bindle has really
gotten inside your head

1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.060
with all of his hippie friends.

1:27:12.195 --> 1:27:14.298
You actually think that
you singing your old songs

1:27:14.434 --> 1:27:16.096
dressed in black leather,

1:27:16.231 --> 1:27:19.070
sweating, mumbling incoherently
to the audience

1:27:19.205 --> 1:27:20.640
was a good show?

1:27:20.775 --> 1:27:22.672
Colonel, I know when
I've excited an audience.

1:27:22.808 --> 1:27:25.247
That was not a real audience,
my boy.

1:27:25.382 --> 1:27:27.281
There was a sign
flashing "applaud,"

1:27:27.417 --> 1:27:29.076
telling them
when to clap for you.

1:27:29.211 --> 1:27:32.013
This entire jamboree
is an embarrassment.

1:27:33.423 --> 1:27:34.649
You have embarrassed
the sponsors,

1:27:34.785 --> 1:27:35.984
you have embarrassed yourself,

1:27:36.119 --> 1:27:37.455
-you have embarrassed me.

1:27:37.591 --> 1:27:40.119
Now, you can sing
whatever songs

1:27:40.255 --> 1:27:43.422
you and Mr. Bindle choose
for 55 minutes,

1:27:43.558 --> 1:27:46.863
but at the end of the show,
there will be a Christmas song.

1:27:48.269 --> 1:27:51.164
Or else we will be sued.

1:27:51.299 --> 1:27:54.576
No, you will be sued
for breach of contract,

1:27:54.712 --> 1:27:58.012
because I will no longer be
the promoter of your career.

1:27:58.148 --> 1:27:59.777
I will have to leave you.

1:28:01.917 --> 1:28:02.813
Hmm.

1:28:05.481 --> 1:28:06.850
Mmm-hmm.

1:28:15.762 --> 1:28:17.356
Now, I have convinced
our friends

1:28:17.491 --> 1:28:19.859
at Singer Sewing Machines
to come back tomorrow

1:28:19.995 --> 1:28:22.327
for "Here Comes Santa Claus."

1:28:22.462 --> 1:28:25.797
I will see you in the morning,
Mr. Presley.

1:28:25.933 --> 1:28:27.473
Oh, and as I recall,

1:28:27.609 --> 1:28:30.036
Dr. King said
rock and roll music

1:28:30.172 --> 1:28:32.843
contributed
to juvenile delinquency.

1:28:32.979 --> 1:28:34.214
<i>It would be wrong,</i>

1:28:34.350 --> 1:28:35.710
<i>it would be self-deceptive</i>

1:28:35.845 --> 1:28:37.518
<i>to ignore the connection</i>

1:28:37.653 --> 1:28:39.846
<i>between that lawlessness</i>
<i>and hatred</i>

1:28:39.982 --> 1:28:42.090
<i>and this act of violence.</i>

1:28:42.226 --> 1:28:43.989
<i>It would be just as wrong</i>

1:28:44.125 --> 1:28:47.329
<i>and just as self-deceptive</i>
<i>to conclude from this act</i>

1:28:47.464 --> 1:28:49.824
<i>that our country</i>
<i>itself is sick,</i>

1:28:49.959 --> 1:28:51.565
<i>that it's lost its balance,</i>

1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:54.168
<i>that it's lost its sense</i>
<i>of direction,</i>

1:28:54.303 --> 1:28:56.400
<i>even its common decency.</i>

1:28:56.536 --> 1:28:58.167
<i>200 million Americans</i>

1:28:58.303 --> 1:29:01.504
<i>did not strike down</i>
<i>Robert Kennedy last night,</i>

1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:03.005
<i>any more than they struck down</i>

1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:07.143
<i>President John F. Kennedy</i>
<i>in 1963,</i>

1:29:07.278 --> 1:29:10.513
<i>or Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>in April of this year.</i>

1:29:10.649 --> 1:29:13.048
<i>My fellow citizens, we cannot,</i>

1:29:13.183 --> 1:29:15.651
<i>we just must not tolerate</i>
<i>the sway</i>

1:29:15.786 --> 1:29:17.890
<i>of violent men among us.</i>

1:29:18.026 --> 1:29:21.859
<i>We must not permit men</i>
<i>that are filled with hate--</i>

1:29:30.903 --> 1:29:35.202
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:42.979
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1:29:44.354 --> 1:29:48.655
<i>Right down Santa Claus...</i>

1:29:56.194 --> 1:29:59.467
We're pretty set for the number
tomorrow, right, E.P.?

1:29:59.603 --> 1:30:02.537
<i>It's pretty familiar territory,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1:30:04.934 --> 1:30:07.102
A reverend once told me...

1:30:09.239 --> 1:30:12.107
"When things are too dangerous
to say...

1:30:14.775 --> 1:30:16.452
sing."

1:30:39.638 --> 1:30:45.338
<i>There must be lights</i>
<i>Burning brighter somewhere</i>

1:30:46.847 --> 1:30:51.152
<i>Got to be birds</i>
<i>flying higher</i>

1:30:51.287 --> 1:30:54.749
<i>In a sky more blue</i>

1:30:56.993 --> 1:30:59.327
Standing by.
We're seconds away, folks.

1:30:59.462 --> 1:31:00.959
We're just waiting on upstairs.

1:31:01.094 --> 1:31:03.488
We're gonna get a rehearsal
going very shortly.

1:31:03.624 --> 1:31:06.266
Let's go, let's go, people!
First positions!

1:31:06.402 --> 1:31:07.933
Here we go, from the top.

1:31:08.069 --> 1:31:11.197
Mrs. Presley is quite
the homemaker, Priscilla is,

1:31:11.333 --> 1:31:12.774
and I'm sure
she would love to have

1:31:12.909 --> 1:31:16.039
one of the SK551 machines
so she can knit Elvis's--

1:31:16.174 --> 1:31:18.340
-They were in there all night.
-Doing what?

1:31:18.475 --> 1:31:20.378
He's working on a new song.
He says he's singing it.

1:31:20.514 --> 1:31:22.145
New song? Whoa, hey!

1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:24.714
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas. Yes!

1:31:24.849 --> 1:31:26.687
Gentlemen, take your seats.

1:31:29.318 --> 1:31:32.059
Now, that's
a winter wonderland.

1:31:32.194 --> 1:31:33.727
Mr. Bindle.

1:31:33.862 --> 1:31:38.895
You and I are
on the same page at last.

1:31:39.031 --> 1:31:40.762
Bring up the lights
on the sign.

1:31:40.897 --> 1:31:43.397
Okay, yeah. Let's go.

1:31:43.533 --> 1:31:45.937
Dancers, stop.
Dancers, stop. Stop!

1:31:46.903 --> 1:31:49.668
Turn about. Turn about.

1:31:49.804 --> 1:31:51.703
You've got to get some roll.
I got action on the right side.

1:31:51.838 --> 1:31:54.275
<i>Turn around. Come on,</i>
<i>through, through, through!</i>

1:31:57.684 --> 1:32:00.017
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

1:32:01.390 --> 1:32:03.889
<i>With too much rain</i>

1:32:05.285 --> 1:32:07.728
<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

1:32:09.059 --> 1:32:12.834
<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

1:32:12.970 --> 1:32:18.902
<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

1:32:19.038 --> 1:32:25.911
<i>He can redeem</i>
<i>his soul and fly</i>

1:32:30.382 --> 1:32:37.923
<i>Deep in my heart</i>
<i>There's a trembling question</i>

1:32:38.058 --> 1:32:41.958
<i>Still, I am sure</i>
<i>That the answer's</i>

1:32:42.094 --> 1:32:45.497
<i>Answer's gonna come</i>
<i>somehow</i>

1:32:45.633 --> 1:32:49.165
<i>Out there in the dark</i>

1:32:49.300 --> 1:32:53.434
<i>There's a beckoning candle,</i>
<i>yeah</i>

1:32:53.569 --> 1:32:57.173
<i>And while I can think</i>
<i>While I can talk</i>

1:32:57.308 --> 1:33:01.282
<i>While I can stand</i>
<i>While I can walk</i>

1:33:01.417 --> 1:33:04.912
<i>While I can dream</i>

1:33:05.048 --> 1:33:09.080
<i>Oh, please let my dream</i>

1:33:09.215 --> 1:33:12.793
<i>Come true, oh</i>

1:33:16.563 --> 1:33:20.225
<i>Right now</i>

1:33:20.361 --> 1:33:22.902
<i>Let it come true right now</i>

1:33:35.610 --> 1:33:37.512
<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

1:33:37.647 --> 1:33:40.013
<i> I was always said,</i>
<i>when it came to music,</i>

1:33:40.148 --> 1:33:41.880
<i>my boy knows best.</i>

1:33:42.016 --> 1:33:46.618
<i>But the special was my idea.</i>
<i>It was a tremendous hit.</i>

1:33:47.662 --> 1:33:49.326
<i>We was back on top.</i>

1:33:49.462 --> 1:33:53.159
<i>But some people were</i>
<i>putting ideas into his head</i>

1:33:53.294 --> 1:33:56.967
<i>that he didn't need me no more.</i>

1:34:02.643 --> 1:34:03.811
Whoo-hoo!

1:34:05.271 --> 1:34:06.505
<i>It's working.</i>

1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:07.979
<i> London, Germany,</i>
<i>Japan...</i>

1:34:08.114 --> 1:34:09.514
<i>Hulett here has got it</i>
<i>all lined up.</i>

1:34:09.650 --> 1:34:11.447
Air Presley's new wings.

1:34:11.583 --> 1:34:13.513
You know, when you
play stadiums, it's like...

1:34:13.648 --> 1:34:15.449
you do a week of shows
in just one night.

1:34:15.584 --> 1:34:17.891
And when it's done,
you get on the plane...

1:34:18.026 --> 1:34:20.026
You go where you want,
you play where you want,

1:34:20.161 --> 1:34:22.554
and if they don't like it,
you go someplace else.

1:34:22.689 --> 1:34:24.565
You know who told me that?
B.B. King.

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.497
Well, B.B. knows, man.

1:34:26.632 --> 1:34:28.730
And the someplace else
you should be going
is overseas.

1:34:28.865 --> 1:34:30.499
I like that.

1:34:30.635 --> 1:34:32.570
You know, I heard last year
alone, you had two offers.

1:34:32.705 --> 1:34:34.103
Germany and Japan,

1:34:34.238 --> 1:34:37.108
for a million bucks
for one night.

1:34:37.243 --> 1:34:39.379
I mean, why the Colonel
would turn that down,

1:34:39.515 --> 1:34:41.014
I have no idea, man.

1:34:41.149 --> 1:34:43.447
Well, if you figure it out,
can you let us know?

1:34:43.582 --> 1:34:45.019
Yeah.

1:34:45.154 --> 1:34:45.913
Well, screw him.
You've got the plane now.

1:34:46.048 --> 1:34:47.422
You should use it.

1:34:47.557 --> 1:34:49.449
Yeah, come to Daddy.

1:34:49.585 --> 1:34:51.559
Maybe we should call it
the "Lisa Marie."

1:34:51.694 --> 1:34:52.854
That's a beautiful name.

1:34:52.989 --> 1:34:54.059
Right?

1:34:56.499 --> 1:34:59.724
Hit me. Hit me.

1:34:59.859 --> 1:35:04.228
Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn
would like to see you.

1:35:04.364 --> 1:35:06.698
Colonel Parker. Hit me.

1:35:08.841 --> 1:35:10.845
I can't, sorry.

1:35:13.908 --> 1:35:16.378
<i> You've run up</i>
<i>quite a tab, Colonel.</i>

1:35:16.513 --> 1:35:19.755
And we hear your boy's working
with new people.

1:35:20.855 --> 1:35:23.522
You've lost your meal ticket.

1:35:23.658 --> 1:35:25.890
It's time to settle up,

1:35:26.026 --> 1:35:28.427
before we have
to make things...

1:35:28.563 --> 1:35:30.592
Uncomfortable.

1:35:30.727 --> 1:35:33.698
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

1:35:33.834 --> 1:35:36.496
No passport, no residency.

1:35:36.632 --> 1:35:39.473
You were never a colonel.
Never a Tom.

1:35:39.609 --> 1:35:41.337
You weren't even a Parker.

1:35:41.473 --> 1:35:46.980
Why did you flee Holland,
Andreas van Kuijk?

1:35:50.779 --> 1:35:52.514
-I don't know why

1:35:52.649 --> 1:35:54.316
you can't just let
the lawyers take care of it.

1:35:54.451 --> 1:35:56.089
I have to see him
in Vegas.

1:35:56.225 --> 1:35:58.419
He's in the hospital.
It's the right thing to do.

1:35:58.554 --> 1:35:59.794
-Yeah, well...
-He's frail right now.

1:35:59.929 --> 1:36:01.123
-You know what he's like, baby.

1:36:01.259 --> 1:36:03.262
-Hey! Watch it.

1:36:03.397 --> 1:36:05.133
You know what he's like.
The second that
you're near him,

1:36:05.269 --> 1:36:07.562
you'll be under ten feet
of snow before you know
what's happened.

1:36:07.697 --> 1:36:10.668
My mind's made up.
Business is business.

1:36:10.803 --> 1:36:12.137
He and I are done.

1:36:12.272 --> 1:36:14.107
But I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

1:36:14.242 --> 1:36:17.609
Well, just make sure he
doesn't clip your wings, honey.

1:36:17.744 --> 1:36:19.439
He won't!

1:36:19.575 --> 1:36:22.182
I am gonna go
see him in Vegas.

1:36:22.318 --> 1:36:26.913
I'm gonna look him in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell him...

1:36:27.048 --> 1:36:28.952
-Watch my hair.
-I'm gonna tell him...

1:36:29.087 --> 1:36:30.423
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:36:31.957 --> 1:36:32.828
...it's over.

1:36:38.262 --> 1:36:40.666
<i>You break it, you burn it</i>

1:36:40.801 --> 1:36:43.536
<i>Drag it all around</i>

1:36:43.672 --> 1:36:46.001
You twist it and turn it

1:36:46.137 --> 1:36:48.538
<i>You cannot tear it down</i>

1:36:48.674 --> 1:36:51.342
<i>'Cause every minute,</i>
<i>every hour you'll be shaken</i>

1:36:51.477 --> 1:36:53.979
<i>By the strength</i>
<i>and mighty power of my love</i>

1:36:54.115 --> 1:36:55.741
Colonel doesn't want you
making a fuss.

1:37:02.791 --> 1:37:03.852
-Colonel?
-Mmm?

1:37:03.988 --> 1:37:04.984
Elvis is here.

1:37:05.119 --> 1:37:06.261
Oh...

1:37:06.396 --> 1:37:09.354
Oh. My boy.

1:37:09.489 --> 1:37:11.626
Admiral. How are you?

1:37:11.761 --> 1:37:15.036
Oh, my boy, I should have
come down to see you.

1:37:15.171 --> 1:37:17.334
But I'm a little
laid up, you know.

1:37:17.469 --> 1:37:18.564
You've just
had a heart attack.

1:37:18.699 --> 1:37:20.139
You're not meant
to get out of bed.

1:37:20.275 --> 1:37:22.670
Heart attack?
Colonel, you said your back--

1:37:22.805 --> 1:37:26.513
My heart just stopped is all,
and I fell. It's--

1:37:26.648 --> 1:37:28.646
I put my back out.

1:37:30.851 --> 1:37:32.683
There you go.

1:37:32.818 --> 1:37:35.557
It was all the excitement about
the Christmas special, you see.

1:37:35.692 --> 1:37:37.024
I should never have worried,

1:37:37.159 --> 1:37:40.852
because you came through
like you always do.

1:37:40.987 --> 1:37:45.356
Nobody can sell "show"
to an audience like you.

1:37:45.492 --> 1:37:47.727
I admit it. I was wrong.

1:37:49.670 --> 1:37:51.038
Colonel, I--

1:37:52.237 --> 1:37:53.975
I wanted to tell you in person.

1:37:54.773 --> 1:37:57.042
Um...

1:37:57.177 --> 1:38:00.443
As far as business
is concerned...

1:38:00.578 --> 1:38:02.775
I think we need to go
our separate ways.

1:38:07.921 --> 1:38:09.923
Well, you may be right.

1:38:10.058 --> 1:38:12.586
Maybe it is time for me
to retire.

1:38:12.722 --> 1:38:14.627
Oh, come on, Colonel,
quit snowin' me.

1:38:14.763 --> 1:38:16.192
You ain't retiring.

1:38:16.327 --> 1:38:20.430
I will miss the circus. I will.

1:38:20.565 --> 1:38:22.801
But I cannot keep up
with these young fellas,

1:38:22.936 --> 1:38:24.532
like your Mr. Hulett,

1:38:24.667 --> 1:38:27.432
who wants to put together
a new show

1:38:27.568 --> 1:38:30.138
for an international tour,

1:38:30.274 --> 1:38:32.708
for you to play stadiums.

1:38:32.843 --> 1:38:38.151
These international tours
are very, very expensive.

1:38:38.287 --> 1:38:41.756
And the costs
cut into the artist's profits.

1:38:41.891 --> 1:38:43.825
I worry that the financial risk

1:38:43.961 --> 1:38:46.760
would put a strain
on your daddy.

1:38:46.895 --> 1:38:48.455
But I cannot help but think,

1:38:48.591 --> 1:38:50.425
as your former
technical advisor

1:38:50.561 --> 1:38:53.663
and as an old friend,
what if...

1:38:53.799 --> 1:38:58.501
the next Elvis Presley show
did not cost you a red cent?

1:39:01.444 --> 1:39:06.509
I wonder if your daddy would
not like the sound of that.

1:39:08.018 --> 1:39:11.316
The brand-new
International Hotel.

1:39:30.974 --> 1:39:33.597
It's a mighty big stage.

1:39:33.733 --> 1:39:35.670
The biggest in Las Vegas.

1:39:35.805 --> 1:39:37.870
You could get lost
in a place like this.

1:39:38.006 --> 1:39:40.772
My boy, you performed
that comeback special

1:39:40.908 --> 1:39:43.717
on a tiny square,
inside a studio,

1:39:43.852 --> 1:39:45.509
and the fans loved it.

1:39:45.645 --> 1:39:47.155
In a room this size,

1:39:47.290 --> 1:39:51.849
you could give them
the greatest show on earth.

1:39:51.985 --> 1:39:55.590
Nothing less
than Elvis Presley.

1:39:55.726 --> 1:39:58.665
I've been experimenting
with a new, big sound.

1:39:58.801 --> 1:40:00.067
Good. Good, my boy.

1:40:00.203 --> 1:40:02.236
Because you can fill up
this entire stage

1:40:02.371 --> 1:40:04.996
with every musical idea
that is inside that head.

1:40:06.203 --> 1:40:07.570
No, it would cost.

1:40:07.705 --> 1:40:10.078
Yes, that's the beauty of it.

1:40:10.213 --> 1:40:12.012
You see, this here
International Hotel--

1:40:18.287 --> 1:40:19.883
This International Hotel...

1:40:20.018 --> 1:40:20.986
Mmm-hmm.

1:40:21.122 --> 1:40:23.817
...needs a major drawing card

1:40:23.952 --> 1:40:27.654
to pull in all the rubes
and put it on the map.

1:40:27.789 --> 1:40:30.424
So they will cover
all of the costs

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:32.594
of putting together your show.

1:40:32.729 --> 1:40:34.393
And you just play here
for six weeks,

1:40:34.529 --> 1:40:36.329
and then off you go,

1:40:36.465 --> 1:40:39.163
to tour around the world

1:40:39.298 --> 1:40:43.103
with no financial risk
to Elvis Presley Enterprises.

1:40:43.238 --> 1:40:44.508
None.

1:40:49.279 --> 1:40:51.284
Well, goddamn.

1:40:57.953 --> 1:41:00.788
-Snowman strikes again.
-Oh, yeah.

1:41:00.923 --> 1:41:05.062
We're going to make it snow.
It will snow.

1:41:05.198 --> 1:41:07.427
<i> First of all,</i>
<i>we're gonna need</i>
<i>the Sweet Inspirations.</i>

1:41:07.563 --> 1:41:09.760
<i> Yeah, yeah</i>

1:41:09.896 --> 1:41:11.804
<i> And the Imperials.</i>

1:41:11.939 --> 1:41:14.107
<i> We're caught</i>
<i>in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:41:14.243 --> 1:41:16.172
<i>And a 30-piece orchestra.</i>

1:41:23.919 --> 1:41:26.446
<i> You know,</i>
<i>the first thing</i>
<i>that I ever recorded,</i>

1:41:26.582 --> 1:41:28.047
<i>the very first thing,</i>

1:41:28.182 --> 1:41:31.050
<i>was an old, uh, rhythm</i>
<i>and blues-type song</i>

1:41:31.185 --> 1:41:33.285
<i>called "That's All Right,</i>
<i>Little Mama."</i>

1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:35.823
<i>-And back then we only had</i>

1:41:35.959 --> 1:41:39.067
<i>two or three instruments</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

1:41:39.202 --> 1:41:41.092
<i>But this ain't</i>
<i>no nostalgia show.</i>

1:41:41.227 --> 1:41:43.100
<i>We're gonna do something</i>
<i>different.</i>

1:41:47.209 --> 1:41:51.477
I, uh...
I wanna try something new.

1:41:51.613 --> 1:41:55.177
All right, Glen, you're gonna
start us off, okay?

1:41:55.313 --> 1:41:56.547
Take the intro here.

1:42:13.830 --> 1:42:15.401
All right, bring that
bass up, Jerry.

1:42:19.809 --> 1:42:20.967
Keep playing.

1:42:23.341 --> 1:42:24.678
Whoo!

1:42:24.813 --> 1:42:27.545
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1:42:27.681 --> 1:42:29.206
<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

1:42:29.342 --> 1:42:30.781
<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

1:42:30.917 --> 1:42:32.153
Boys...

1:42:32.288 --> 1:42:32.851
<i>That's all right</i>

1:42:32.986 --> 1:42:33.821
With me.

1:42:33.957 --> 1:42:35.514
<i> Any way you do</i>

1:42:35.649 --> 1:42:36.488
All right.

1:42:41.625 --> 1:42:43.163
<i> James, you ready?</i>

1:42:43.299 --> 1:42:45.156
-Oh!

1:42:51.807 --> 1:42:52.998
Flames, man!

1:42:53.134 --> 1:42:55.072
Flames are coming
out of that guitar.

1:42:55.208 --> 1:42:57.878
I got that. Ronnie.

1:42:58.013 --> 1:42:59.104
I'll get back to that.

1:42:59.882 --> 1:43:02.674
Horns, you ready?

1:43:02.810 --> 1:43:06.216
<i>Ba-da-bom! Ba-da-bom!</i>

1:43:09.024 --> 1:43:10.190
Let's up the octave!

1:43:11.756 --> 1:43:14.459
-Yeah! Goddamn!

1:43:14.595 --> 1:43:17.791
All right, 'bones.
On a one, three, four...

1:43:25.166 --> 1:43:27.604
Ronnie,
you know what to do, man.

1:43:27.739 --> 1:43:29.767
Do it to me, come on.
Take us home.

1:43:31.809 --> 1:43:34.708
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Hah! Hah! Hah!

1:43:34.844 --> 1:43:36.850

Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1:43:36.986 --> 1:43:38.543
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1:43:55.201 --> 1:43:57.728
-Colonel,

-Oh, here you are.

1:43:57.863 --> 1:43:59.406
Yeah. Here you go.

1:44:02.112 --> 1:44:03.409
-How 'bout a hound dog?
-Cool.

1:44:03.545 --> 1:44:04.569
I'll fix you with
some food and drink.

1:44:04.704 --> 1:44:05.769
Thank you.

1:44:08.909 --> 1:44:10.443
All right, let's go.

1:44:45.954 --> 1:44:49.281
<i>Well, that's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

1:44:49.416 --> 1:44:52.120
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Just any way you do</i>

1:44:52.255 --> 1:44:53.825
<i>-That's all right</i>

1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:55.695
<i>-That's all right</i>
-<i> That's all right</i>

1:44:55.831 --> 1:45:02.198
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do, yeah</i>

1:45:02.333 --> 1:45:06.370
<i>Well, my mama,</i>
<i>she done told me</i>
<i>Papa told me too</i>

1:45:06.505 --> 1:45:08.866
<i>"The life you're livin, son</i>
<i>Now, women be</i>
<i>the death of you"</i>

1:45:09.002 --> 1:45:10.669
<i>Now, that's all right</i>

1:45:10.805 --> 1:45:12.237
<i>That's all right</i>

1:45:12.373 --> 1:45:17.044
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

1:45:26.492 --> 1:45:28.126
<i> That's all right</i>

1:45:28.262 --> 1:45:29.963
<i>That's all right</i>

1:45:30.099 --> 1:45:31.656
<i>That's all right</i>

1:45:31.792 --> 1:45:33.797
<i>Any way you do</i>

1:45:35.771 --> 1:45:39.068
<i>Da, da-da, dee, dee, dee</i>
<i>Dee, dee, dee-dee</i>

1:45:39.204 --> 1:45:42.368

<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

1:46:09.528 --> 1:46:12.368
Ain't nobody gonna do
a better show than that.

1:46:12.504 --> 1:46:13.901
I tell ya, if I was you,

1:46:14.037 --> 1:46:16.202
I would book him
for a hundred years.

1:46:17.613 --> 1:46:20.581
Well, no better time
than the present.

1:46:20.716 --> 1:46:23.909
But we hear Hulett has him
doing a world tour.

1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:28.722
Well, well, well, uh,
I think Mr. Presley

1:46:28.858 --> 1:46:32.425
could be persuaded to make
the International his home,

1:46:32.561 --> 1:46:36.063
provided he was paid
pretty well.

1:46:36.199 --> 1:46:37.863
What did you have in mind?

1:46:37.999 --> 1:46:40.095
I'd like to introduce to you
a couple of people tonight,

1:46:40.230 --> 1:46:42.861
one of which being
my beautiful wife, Priscilla.

1:46:44.768 --> 1:46:46.233
Would you stand up, honey?

1:46:46.368 --> 1:46:49.942
For an attraction as tremendous
as Mr. Presley...

1:46:50.077 --> 1:46:53.747
-We love you,
Priscilla!

1:46:53.883 --> 1:46:57.243
Also, this man over here,
I wouldn't be here without,

1:46:57.378 --> 1:47:00.551
my manager of many years,
Colonel Sanders.

1:47:00.686 --> 1:47:04.316
-Parker. Parker.

1:47:04.452 --> 1:47:06.524
Well, we're gonna do a new song
for you tonight.

1:47:06.659 --> 1:47:08.787
It's called "Suspicious Minds."

1:47:08.923 --> 1:47:10.130
"Suspicious Minds."

1:47:14.599 --> 1:47:16.427
<i>We're caught in a trap</i>

1:47:18.174 --> 1:47:20.266
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:47:21.808 --> 1:47:27.306
<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

1:47:29.581 --> 1:47:31.175
<i>Why can't you see</i>

1:47:31.310 --> 1:47:35.349
<i>Oh, what you're doin' to me</i>

1:47:35.484 --> 1:47:41.452
<i>Oh, when you don't believe</i>
<i>A word I'm sayin'?</i>

1:47:44.262 --> 1:47:50.667
<i>We can't go on together</i>
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

1:47:50.802 --> 1:47:53.800
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

1:47:53.936 --> 1:47:57.702
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

1:47:57.837 --> 1:48:01.379
<i>So, if an old friend I know</i>
<i>Shove it up your nose</i>

1:48:01.515 --> 1:48:03.578
<i>Stops by to say hello</i>

1:48:05.481 --> 1:48:12.591
<i>Would I still see suspicion</i>
<i>in your eyes?</i>

1:48:12.727 --> 1:48:16.025
That is what my boy
would expect.

1:48:18.023 --> 1:48:20.696
Now...

1:48:20.832 --> 1:48:23.267
What are you going to pay me?

1:48:28.476 --> 1:48:32.446
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

1:48:32.582 --> 1:48:37.510
Colonel, your sideshow
is the jackpot.

1:48:39.183 --> 1:48:41.585
If you bring him back
every year,

1:48:41.721 --> 1:48:44.148
I'll make it worth your while.

1:48:44.284 --> 1:48:46.561
<i> Oh, I've never...</i>

1:48:49.022 --> 1:48:51.566
<i>Lied to you</i>

1:48:52.796 --> 1:48:54.162
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1:48:55.865 --> 1:48:58.667
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:48:58.802 --> 1:49:00.399
<i>...good thing die</i>

1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.905
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Now, don't you know</i>

1:49:07.041 --> 1:49:08.048
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1:49:10.253 --> 1:49:11.916
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:49:13.522 --> 1:49:16.591
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1:49:20.455 --> 1:49:25.061
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:49:26.535 --> 1:49:29.296
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1:49:33.402 --> 1:49:38.074
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:49:39.515 --> 1:49:42.276
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1:49:46.382 --> 1:49:50.581
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1:49:52.354 --> 1:49:57.489
<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

1:49:57.624 --> 1:50:00.591
<i>Oh, don't you know</i>
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1:50:02.764 --> 1:50:06.063
Of course, I will reserve
the right to sell calendars,

1:50:06.198 --> 1:50:07.338
pictures and such?

1:50:10.604 --> 1:50:12.504
You do whatever
you want, Colonel,

1:50:12.639 --> 1:50:16.508
as long as that boy
stays on that stage.

1:50:30.965 --> 1:50:33.158
<i> My boy's light</i>
<i>burned brighter</i>

1:50:33.294 --> 1:50:36.027
<i>than even 15 years before.</i>

1:50:36.163 --> 1:50:37.364
Hi, darlin'.

1:51:05.198 --> 1:51:08.193
<i> I saw in her face</i>
<i>that night</i>

1:51:08.328 --> 1:51:11.169
<i>what I had always known.</i>

1:51:11.305 --> 1:51:16.711
<i>She could never compete</i>
<i>with the love he felt from you.</i>

1:51:24.810 --> 1:51:26.545
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it up there, man.

1:51:28.216 --> 1:51:32.516
<i>Take my... take my hand</i>

1:51:32.652 --> 1:51:37.390
<i>Take my whole...</i>
<i>whole life too</i>

1:51:37.526 --> 1:51:39.862
<i>For I... for I...</i>
<i>I can't help</i>

1:51:39.997 --> 1:51:41.501
Hey, guys. Time to go back.

1:51:41.636 --> 1:51:45.399
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1:51:45.534 --> 1:51:51.003
<i>Oh, oh, for I...</i>
<i>For I can't help</i>

1:51:51.138 --> 1:51:54.511
<i>Falling in love</i>

1:51:54.646 --> 1:51:59.886
<i>With you</i>

1:52:20.036 --> 1:52:21.600
Thank you very much.

1:52:25.745 --> 1:52:27.738
Thank you! Thank you.

1:52:42.387 --> 1:52:44.223
Such a fine show.

1:52:49.803 --> 1:52:51.633
Yeah, baby! Yeah.

1:52:51.768 --> 1:52:54.105
-Wow, great show.
-Thank you. Thank you, all.

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.600
Goddamn, Elvis.
That was great.

1:52:56.736 --> 1:52:57.807
That was fantastic.

1:52:57.942 --> 1:52:58.936
There she is.

1:53:08.991 --> 1:53:11.325
Oh, God. I don't know
who that was out there.

1:53:11.460 --> 1:53:13.617
You were... You...

1:53:13.753 --> 1:53:15.219
You were incredible.
You were...

1:53:15.355 --> 1:53:16.497
You were everything.

1:53:16.632 --> 1:53:19.966
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

1:53:21.866 --> 1:53:23.795
Mr. Elvis Presley,

1:53:23.930 --> 1:53:26.539
I guess that's your
new manager over there, hmm?

1:53:26.675 --> 1:53:28.336
-Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:53:28.472 --> 1:53:30.667
Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to him,
all right?

1:53:30.803 --> 1:53:32.510
-Okay.
-You okay to get upstairs?

1:53:32.646 --> 1:53:33.705
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1:53:49.030 --> 1:53:51.994
Tremendous...
tremendous triumph.

1:53:52.129 --> 1:53:54.892
The greatest show on earth.

1:53:55.028 --> 1:53:59.703
My dear boy, this brainchild
came from you and me,

1:53:59.838 --> 1:54:03.470
but you alone
rose above it all,
and it worked with your talent,

1:54:03.606 --> 1:54:06.909
and your dedication.

1:54:07.044 --> 1:54:08.572
We did it. We did it!

1:54:08.707 --> 1:54:10.478
-We did it.
-We did.

1:54:12.117 --> 1:54:14.882
Come on.

1:54:16.885 --> 1:54:19.685
I can't wait to show the world
what you and I can do.

1:54:22.490 --> 1:54:24.765
The world will see this show.

1:54:24.900 --> 1:54:26.896
Whatever it takes,
I guarantee it.

1:54:27.031 --> 1:54:28.364
Whatever I have to do.

1:54:32.504 --> 1:54:33.798
<i> Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>of the press,</i>

1:54:33.933 --> 1:54:36.708
the King of Rock and Roll,
Elvis Presley!

1:54:38.572 --> 1:54:40.113
No, I'm not the king.

1:54:40.249 --> 1:54:42.917
Hey, Fats. Mr. Fats Domino,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:54:43.052 --> 1:54:44.782
This is the real king
of rock and roll.

1:54:44.918 --> 1:54:46.383
Yeah, I'm somethin' else.

1:54:46.518 --> 1:54:48.517
Any plans
to take this show on tour?

1:54:48.652 --> 1:54:50.684
There's so many places
I haven't been yet, you know.

1:54:50.820 --> 1:54:54.619
I'd like to go to Europe.
I'd like to go to Japan.

1:54:54.755 --> 1:54:56.629
I've never been
out of the country,

1:54:56.764 --> 1:54:58.126
<i>except in the service.</i>

1:55:04.336 --> 1:55:05.863
What are you lookin' at
back there?

1:55:06.739 --> 1:55:07.764
Oh, Mr. Diskin.

1:55:07.900 --> 1:55:09.436
Have we discussed
with Mr. Hulett,

1:55:09.572 --> 1:55:11.203
pertaining
to the death threats?

1:55:11.338 --> 1:55:13.239
The death threats?

1:55:13.375 --> 1:55:15.976
Precisely. Death threats!

1:55:17.719 --> 1:55:19.745
<i>Down in Louisiana</i>

1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:23.684
<i>Where the alligators</i>
<i>Grow so mean</i>

1:55:23.819 --> 1:55:27.092
<i>Lived a girl that I swear</i>
<i>To the world</i>

1:55:27.228 --> 1:55:29.353
<i>Made the alligators</i>
<i>look tame</i>

1:55:29.489 --> 1:55:30.331
<i>Polk salad Annie</i>

1:55:33.434 --> 1:55:34.959
<i> Colonel,</i>
<i>once we finish the season,</i>

1:55:35.094 --> 1:55:36.961
<i>Elvis wants</i>
<i>to take the tour overseas.</i>

1:55:37.096 --> 1:55:40.201
Overseas? Have you thought
about security, Jerry?

1:55:40.337 --> 1:55:42.270
<i> Of course I have.</i>

1:55:42.405 --> 1:55:44.307
<i> This is Elvis Presley,</i>

1:55:44.443 --> 1:55:47.473
<i>the most famous man</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

1:55:47.608 --> 1:55:50.044
<i>Straight-razor totin' woman</i>

1:55:50.180 --> 1:55:51.745
<i>Lord, have mercy</i>

1:55:51.881 --> 1:55:53.183
<i> The crazies</i>
<i>in those countries...</i>

1:55:53.319 --> 1:55:55.517
They're a hundred times
more dangerous.

1:55:55.653 --> 1:55:58.351
Am I the only one
who thinks about security?

1:55:58.486 --> 1:56:01.419
<i>Sock a little polk salad</i>

1:56:01.554 --> 1:56:02.854
<i>You know I need it</i>

1:56:04.661 --> 1:56:07.698
There is nothing more important
than security!

1:56:21.813 --> 1:56:25.910
Am I the only one who ever
thinks about Elvis' security!

1:56:32.794 --> 1:56:33.984
Get him out of here!

1:56:40.631 --> 1:56:42.266
<i> Those guys</i>
<i>turned out to be</i>

1:56:42.401 --> 1:56:44.698
<i>some over-excited fans</i>
<i>from Peru.</i>

1:56:44.833 --> 1:56:47.236
<i>But the death threats</i>
<i>were real.</i>

1:56:47.372 --> 1:56:49.769
I'm going back on.

1:56:49.904 --> 1:56:52.068
I'll rip his goddamn tongue out
by the roots.

1:56:52.204 --> 1:56:55.974
<i> It started</i>
<i>to take its toll.</i>

1:56:56.109 --> 1:56:59.078
Here at Baptist Memorial
Hospital in Midtown Memphis,

1:56:59.213 --> 1:57:02.216
Elvis Presley has apparently
checked in to a private suite,

1:57:02.352 --> 1:57:04.056
suffering from exhaustion.

1:57:04.191 --> 1:57:06.318
A sign that Elvis
is in fact here

1:57:06.453 --> 1:57:10.329
is the aluminum foil
that covers his windows
to deflect the sun.

1:57:10.464 --> 1:57:11.990
<i>Shock around the nation today</i>

1:57:12.126 --> 1:57:14.332
<i>as a free rock concert</i>
<i>at the Altamont Speedway</i>

1:57:14.467 --> 1:57:16.769
<i>by English band</i>
<i>The Rolling Stones,</i>

1:57:16.905 --> 1:57:18.701
<i>ended with four deaths.</i>

1:57:18.836 --> 1:57:21.237
<i>One resulting from a stabbing,</i>
<i>allegedly committed...</i>

1:57:21.373 --> 1:57:23.506
Elvis,
Dr. Nick is here.

1:57:25.511 --> 1:57:27.412
Such a lovely girl,
Ms. Tate.

1:57:27.547 --> 1:57:30.079
What has happened to law
and order in this country?

1:57:30.214 --> 1:57:31.943
Hippies and radicals,

1:57:32.078 --> 1:57:35.388
threatening and killing
popular entertainers.

1:57:35.524 --> 1:57:39.659
The IRA blowing up England?
Planes exploding in mid-air?

1:57:39.795 --> 1:57:41.151
Has the world gone mad?

1:57:41.286 --> 1:57:44.058
Hulett's security
is not what it needs to be.

1:57:44.193 --> 1:57:45.628
And he knows it.

1:57:45.763 --> 1:57:47.925
An international tour now
is out of the question.

1:57:48.060 --> 1:57:49.833
What are you talking about,
Colonel?

1:57:49.968 --> 1:57:51.835
I ain't gonna let these sons of
bitches push me off the stage.

1:57:51.970 --> 1:57:53.471
Precisely.

1:57:53.606 --> 1:57:55.236
You are not one of Hulett's
long-hair Zeppelins,

1:57:55.371 --> 1:57:57.302
you are Elvis Presley.

1:57:57.437 --> 1:57:59.246
You are beloved.

1:57:59.381 --> 1:58:02.107
And I told him I have to
look Priscilla in the eye,

1:58:02.243 --> 1:58:06.977
and I have to promise her
that little Lisa Marie's daddy

1:58:07.113 --> 1:58:10.113
will be safe while
he's away from home.

1:58:10.249 --> 1:58:11.915
We're taking the show
to the world, Colonel.

1:58:12.051 --> 1:58:14.227
I ain't gonna disappoint
those fans.

1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:20.665
Well...

1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:25.629
If you want to book more dates,
we could do an American tour,

1:58:25.764 --> 1:58:28.036
15 cities in 15 days,

1:58:28.172 --> 1:58:31.604
while Mr. Hulett
straightens out his security
problems overseas.

1:58:31.739 --> 1:58:33.804
I'd like that
very much, son.

1:58:33.939 --> 1:58:35.345
How is that gonna be any safer?

1:58:35.481 --> 1:58:37.546
Because staying
in this country,

1:58:37.682 --> 1:58:41.448
I can handle every aspect
of security.

1:58:41.584 --> 1:58:43.048
And then we go international?

1:58:43.183 --> 1:58:46.125
Yeah, sure, around the world.
Wherever you want.

1:58:46.261 --> 1:58:47.551
But in the meantime,
here in America,

1:58:47.687 --> 1:58:50.193
we put on a great show.

1:58:50.329 --> 1:58:51.622
And what will we do, Charlie?

1:58:51.757 --> 1:58:53.398
And have a lot of fun.

1:58:54.331 --> 1:58:56.797
Taking care of business.

1:58:58.566 --> 1:59:00.997
Taking care of business.

1:59:07.616 --> 1:59:10.943
<i> I'll get guarantees</i>
<i>from every mayor.</i>

1:59:11.078 --> 1:59:13.145
<i>We'll double</i>
<i>the police presence.</i>

1:59:13.281 --> 1:59:15.981
<i>You'll have more security</i>
<i>than the President.</i>

1:59:18.922 --> 1:59:22.790
<i>Lord Almighty</i>
<i>I feel my temperature rising</i>

1:59:24.799 --> 1:59:28.697
<i>Higher, higher</i>
<i>It's burning through</i>
<i>to my soul</i>

1:59:30.869 --> 1:59:36.575
<i>Girl, girl, girl</i>
<i>You're gonna set me on fire</i>

1:59:36.711 --> 1:59:39.410
<i>My brain is flaming</i>
<i>I don't know which way to go</i>

1:59:39.546 --> 1:59:41.073
<i> And when</i>
<i>the show is done,</i>

1:59:41.209 --> 1:59:44.082
<i>the boys will hustle you</i>
<i>to the motorcade.</i>

1:59:44.217 --> 1:59:46.442
Elvis has left the building.

1:59:46.578 --> 1:59:50.290
<i>Once you're in the air,</i>
<i>Dr. Nick will ensure your rest.</i>

1:59:51.321 --> 1:59:53.087
<i>Burnin' love</i>

1:59:53.222 --> 1:59:55.585
<i> Land in the next city,</i>
<i>then we do it all again.</i>

1:59:55.721 --> 1:59:57.088
<i>Fifteen times!</i>

1:59:57.223 --> 2:00:00.025
<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:02.164
<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

2:00:02.300 --> 2:00:04.867
<i> It was life</i>
<i>on the road,</i>
<i>just like the old days.</i>

2:00:05.002 --> 2:00:09.034
<i>We were making so much snow,</i>
<i>we did it again.</i>

2:00:11.242 --> 2:00:12.675
<i>And again.</i>

2:00:13.541 --> 2:00:15.512
<i>And again.</i>

2:00:15.648 --> 2:00:18.846
<i>All in the safety</i>
<i>of the US of A.</i>

2:00:22.581 --> 2:00:25.890
<i>Eventually, he lost interest</i>
<i>in going overseas.</i>

2:00:26.026 --> 2:00:27.859
<i>Why would you?</i>

2:00:27.994 --> 2:00:32.323
<i>But I still kept my promise.</i>
<i>I brought the world to him.</i>

2:00:32.459 --> 2:00:36.434
<i>I invented the world's</i>
<i>first ever satellite concert.</i>

2:00:39.534 --> 2:00:44.741
<i> 1.5 billion people in</i>
<i>one night, for a single artist.</i>

2:00:44.876 --> 2:00:48.073
<i>Nothing like it before,</i>
<i>nothing like it since.</i>

2:00:57.786 --> 2:01:00.353
<i> But it wasn't enough.</i>

2:01:00.488 --> 2:01:06.398
<i>He was addicted to the love</i>
<i>he felt from you onstage.</i>

2:01:06.534 --> 2:01:09.798
<i>Ordinary love</i>
<i>just didn't compare.</i>

2:01:11.298 --> 2:01:15.976
<i>So, in the lonely moments</i>
<i>between shows,</i>

2:01:16.111 --> 2:01:19.435
<i>he turned to them pills.</i>

2:01:19.571 --> 2:01:21.810
Priscilla, I want you to
do something for me, will you?

2:01:21.945 --> 2:01:25.352
You give my baby girl
a big hug for me, okay?

2:01:27.487 --> 2:01:29.318
<i>The roar of the crowd.</i>

2:01:29.454 --> 2:01:31.519
<i>The life on the road.</i>

2:01:31.654 --> 2:01:34.851
<i>Calling home</i>
<i>to your loved ones,</i>
<i>pretending nothing has changed,</i>

2:01:34.987 --> 2:01:36.853
<i>when everything has.</i>

2:01:36.989 --> 2:01:38.893
<i>-Lost.</i>

2:01:39.825 --> 2:01:41.192
What was that?

2:01:45.098 --> 2:01:47.240
Ain't no one
gonna walk around

2:01:47.376 --> 2:01:48.736
sayin' they killed
Elvis Presley.

2:01:48.871 --> 2:01:51.011
-What did you say?
-Nothing, baby.

2:01:54.211 --> 2:01:56.977
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>has been shot</i>

2:01:57.112 --> 2:01:58.348
<i>in downtown Memphis,</i>
<i>Tennessee...</i>

2:02:01.824 --> 2:02:03.647
<i>Sharon Tate was the last</i>
<i>to die.</i>

2:02:12.858 --> 2:02:14.698
Is that you, doll?

2:02:14.833 --> 2:02:18.396
I'm leaving you,
and I'm taking Lisa with me.

2:02:18.531 --> 2:02:21.302
Uh, 'Cilla, is this about
what happens on the road?

2:02:21.437 --> 2:02:22.705
About the what?

2:02:22.841 --> 2:02:24.368
Is this about what happens
on the road?

2:02:24.504 --> 2:02:25.841
The girls? You think
I give a shit about the girls

2:02:25.976 --> 2:02:27.304
that you sneak in
through the side door?

2:02:27.439 --> 2:02:29.314
No. I couldn't care less
about whoever it is

2:02:29.450 --> 2:02:30.917
you sneak through
the side door.

2:02:31.053 --> 2:02:32.316
It's about this, Elvis.

2:02:32.452 --> 2:02:33.913
-And this.
-Hey. Whoa.

2:02:34.049 --> 2:02:36.047
And these goddamn pills
those leeches

2:02:36.183 --> 2:02:37.516
and has-beens feed
down your throat!

2:02:37.651 --> 2:02:38.786
God damn it.

2:02:38.922 --> 2:02:40.118
-Like you're strung out.
-Strung out?

2:02:40.254 --> 2:02:41.587
Goddamn, I'm in the best
shape of my life.

2:02:41.723 --> 2:02:43.388
Best shape of your life.

2:02:43.524 --> 2:02:44.759
The only time you're happy
is when you're on that stage.

2:02:44.895 --> 2:02:46.356
And in between that,
you're a ghost.

2:02:46.491 --> 2:02:48.232
'Cilla, I give you everything
you could want.

2:02:48.368 --> 2:02:50.060
What I want is a husband.

2:02:50.195 --> 2:02:52.803
I am your wife.
I am your wife!

2:02:52.938 --> 2:02:56.140
And Lisa is your daughter.
She needs a father.

2:02:56.276 --> 2:02:58.236
I am her father!

2:03:04.883 --> 2:03:06.052
Do you remember the last time

2:03:06.188 --> 2:03:07.917
that we laughed together?

2:03:08.053 --> 2:03:09.783
Do you remember the last time
that the three of us

2:03:09.918 --> 2:03:11.682
sat down and had
dinner together?

2:03:13.154 --> 2:03:17.028
You won't even make love
to me anymore.

2:03:17.163 --> 2:03:21.127
I gift you my life, and I have
nothing left in me to give you.

2:03:25.833 --> 2:03:27.298
Do you still love me?

2:03:47.091 --> 2:03:51.355
When you're 40 and I'm 50,
we'll be back together.

2:03:53.661 --> 2:03:55.095
You'll see.

2:04:12.153 --> 2:04:13.747
I have to go.

2:04:13.883 --> 2:04:15.413
Will you please stay?

2:04:15.548 --> 2:04:19.282
I have to go. Okay?
If I stay, I'll never leave.

2:04:19.417 --> 2:04:20.824
-Please...
-You have to let me go.

2:04:20.959 --> 2:04:22.760
-Please, Priscilla.
-You have to let me go.

2:04:45.513 --> 2:04:47.182
<i> Fifty thousand</i>
<i>people gathered</i>

2:04:47.318 --> 2:04:49.182
<i>in New Orleans earlier today</i>
<i>to mourn the passing</i>

2:04:49.317 --> 2:04:51.856
<i>of gospel legend,</i>
<i>Mahalia Jackson.</i>

2:04:51.991 --> 2:04:53.159
<i> Will you</i>
<i>come to Mississippi</i>

2:04:53.295 --> 2:04:55.226
<i>and sing with us, Mr. Presley?</i>

2:04:55.361 --> 2:04:59.431
Why, B.B. King will be there.
Perhaps even
the Rolling Stones.

2:04:59.567 --> 2:05:01.425
<i> I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.</i>

2:05:01.561 --> 2:05:04.769
<i>The Colonel, he...</i>
<i>he won't allow it.</i>

2:05:04.904 --> 2:05:07.363
<i> You are a man,</i>
<i>Mr. Presley.</i>

2:05:07.499 --> 2:05:08.868
And a man don't
make up his own mind

2:05:09.003 --> 2:05:11.403
about matters of conscience.

2:05:11.538 --> 2:05:13.641
<i> Come on, Diskin.</i>
<i>Elvis needs a challenge</i>

2:05:13.777 --> 2:05:15.142
<i>to get back on track.</i>

2:05:15.277 --> 2:05:17.684
Why won't the Colonel
let him go overseas?

2:05:17.819 --> 2:05:19.579
-Security, Jerry.
You know that.
-Bullshit!

2:05:19.715 --> 2:05:21.847
The Colonel's killing
his greatest asset
without a reason.

2:05:21.982 --> 2:05:23.719
So what is the reason?

2:05:23.854 --> 2:05:26.425
Colonel always has his reasons.

2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:28.420
<i>I'm not at liberty to divulge</i>

2:05:28.555 --> 2:05:30.256
<i>personal information</i>
<i>about Mr. Parker.</i>

2:05:30.391 --> 2:05:32.390
-<i> He lied.</i>

2:05:32.526 --> 2:05:33.862
There wasn't gonna be
an international tour

2:05:33.998 --> 2:05:35.360
'cause he can't leave
the country.

2:05:35.495 --> 2:05:37.598
He's got no citizenship,
no official identity.

2:05:37.733 --> 2:05:39.032
He doesn't exist.

2:05:39.168 --> 2:05:42.334
There never was
a Colonel Tom Parker.

2:05:42.469 --> 2:05:44.204
What are you
talking about, Jerry?

2:05:45.604 --> 2:05:46.874
-Hey, whoa, whoa!

2:05:47.010 --> 2:05:47.940
Get him
an ice bucket!

2:05:52.553 --> 2:05:53.882
Colonel's a smart man.

2:05:54.017 --> 2:05:55.320
There's got to be
another reason.

2:05:55.455 --> 2:05:56.654
Come on, man!

2:05:56.789 --> 2:05:58.216
I will
stay here at home,

2:05:58.351 --> 2:06:00.422
and I will work
and I will worry.

2:06:00.557 --> 2:06:02.887
<i> I mean,</i>
<i>why the Colonel</i>
<i>kept turning them down,</i>

2:06:03.023 --> 2:06:03.894
I have no idea, man.

2:06:05.631 --> 2:06:07.062
Get out of the way!

2:06:09.102 --> 2:06:12.903
Now, you listen to me.
The only thing that matters...

2:06:13.038 --> 2:06:16.066
is that that man
gets up on that stage tonight.

2:06:17.736 --> 2:06:20.647
If he was my son,
I'd put him in a hospital.

2:06:25.184 --> 2:06:28.281
Well, of course, this is
a Presley Enterprises decision.

2:06:29.222 --> 2:06:30.547
Vernon?

2:06:31.952 --> 2:06:34.485
Well... um...

2:06:35.528 --> 2:06:37.794
Well, what can you...

2:06:37.929 --> 2:06:40.128
What can you do for him,
Dr. Nick?

2:06:42.430 --> 2:06:49.203
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2:06:54.449 --> 2:07:00.049
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2:07:14.534 --> 2:07:16.660
Thank you. Thank you.

2:07:16.795 --> 2:07:18.802
Now he's gonna ask the house
lights to be brought up,

2:07:18.937 --> 2:07:20.299
'cause we've been
looking at him.

2:07:20.435 --> 2:07:22.267
He wants to look at us now.
He loves this.

2:07:22.403 --> 2:07:23.773
I'd like to turn
the house lights up,

2:07:23.908 --> 2:07:25.705
-ladies and gentlemen.
-Eh?

2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:28.643
'Cause now that you've seen me,
I'd like to take a look at you.

2:07:31.412 --> 2:07:33.620
Oh, you're beautiful.
Thank you.

2:07:33.755 --> 2:07:35.348
He'll mention the VIPs
that are here.

2:07:35.484 --> 2:07:37.555
We've got some high-rollers
in here tonight.

2:07:37.690 --> 2:07:38.986
Get ready for the spotlight.

2:07:39.122 --> 2:07:42.485
Mr. International Hotel
himself.

2:07:42.620 --> 2:07:44.858
-Thank you.
-Ah, there you go.

2:07:44.993 --> 2:07:47.426
And right next to him,

2:07:47.561 --> 2:07:52.364
is my so-called manager,
Colonel Tom Parker.

2:07:52.499 --> 2:07:55.940
-There he is.
-Come on.

2:07:56.076 --> 2:08:01.279
But I hear rumors
that Colonel is an alien.

2:08:04.178 --> 2:08:05.779
Got here on my rocket ship.

2:08:08.387 --> 2:08:09.415
Oh.

2:08:13.318 --> 2:08:15.387
Somebody call the FBI

2:08:15.523 --> 2:08:17.962
and tell 'em that
he has abducted me,

2:08:18.097 --> 2:08:22.429
that he has locked me
in this golden cage,

2:08:22.564 --> 2:08:26.568
to keep me here forever
with you, ladies and gentlemen.

2:08:29.801 --> 2:08:32.410
<i>So I'm caught in a trap</i>

2:08:32.545 --> 2:08:35.078
<i>I can't get out</i>

2:08:36.577 --> 2:08:40.116
'Cause Colonel's got some
big debts, baby.

2:08:44.182 --> 2:08:46.288
Excuse me.

2:08:46.423 --> 2:08:49.790
Well, this is the last show
I'm ever playing here.

2:08:51.461 --> 2:08:56.595
I'm gonna get on my jet plane,
the Lisa Marie...

2:08:56.730 --> 2:09:01.164
It's named after my, uh...
my beautiful daughter.

2:09:01.300 --> 2:09:03.304
And I'm gonna fly away.

2:09:05.105 --> 2:09:07.172
No, no, no...

2:09:07.308 --> 2:09:10.244
You know, I'm gonna fly away.

2:09:10.380 --> 2:09:12.277
Stop the show.
Stop this show!

2:09:12.412 --> 2:09:13.517
Come on,
get this curtain down.

2:09:13.653 --> 2:09:15.581
Fuck the International.

2:09:15.716 --> 2:09:18.950
Mr. Schilling, what the devil
is happening here?

2:09:19.086 --> 2:09:20.485
And Las Vegas.

2:09:20.621 --> 2:09:21.793
That's what
he wants to know.

2:09:21.929 --> 2:09:24.292
Ain't no one
gonna stop me, man.

2:09:25.961 --> 2:09:28.729
Oh! Security.

2:09:28.864 --> 2:09:30.269
Security!

2:09:31.871 --> 2:09:35.472
Security, security! Security!

2:09:35.607 --> 2:09:37.770
800 shows!

2:09:37.905 --> 2:09:40.770
You don't have
a goddamn passport,
you son of a bitch!

2:09:41.548 --> 2:09:43.146
You are fired!

2:09:43.946 --> 2:09:45.951
You are fired!

2:09:46.817 --> 2:09:49.185
You're fired!

2:09:59.027 --> 2:10:00.559
You're fired.

2:10:06.540 --> 2:10:08.006
E., I--

2:10:10.209 --> 2:10:12.637
Colonel, I gotta--
I'll talk him down.

2:10:21.156 --> 2:10:23.285
This is Colonel Tom Parker.
I wish it to be known

2:10:23.421 --> 2:10:26.556
that Dr. Nick's services
are no longer required.

2:10:26.691 --> 2:10:28.026
Thank you.

2:10:29.462 --> 2:10:31.022
Hmm.

2:10:31.157 --> 2:10:32.965
Well, Diskin...

2:10:33.100 --> 2:10:35.495
if the boy wants to set out
on his own,

2:10:35.630 --> 2:10:38.562
it's all right by me,
but Presley Enterprises

2:10:38.698 --> 2:10:41.034
is going to cough up
what it owes.

2:10:41.170 --> 2:10:43.141
-Are you ready?
-Ready.

2:10:43.276 --> 2:10:45.675
Gasoline for the first trip
to the Hayride...

2:10:45.811 --> 2:10:47.536
one dollar and 25 cents.

2:10:47.672 --> 2:10:49.540
Un-recouped promotional costs

2:10:49.676 --> 2:10:52.411
pertaining to souvenir
calendars, $100.

2:10:52.547 --> 2:10:54.920
Collectible trading cards,
$100.

2:10:55.055 --> 2:10:58.182
Posters, flyers and programs,
$100.

2:10:58.318 --> 2:11:00.349
<i>Balloons, $50...</i>

2:11:14.071 --> 2:11:15.269
What's the hold-up?

2:11:15.405 --> 2:11:18.208
Sorry, E.P. Your daddy
won't come down.

2:11:23.076 --> 2:11:24.082
Daddy.

2:11:42.329 --> 2:11:44.266
What is this?

2:11:44.402 --> 2:11:48.073
Well, that is what we owe
the Colonel.

2:11:50.940 --> 2:11:52.572
We're broke.

2:11:55.516 --> 2:11:58.243
Daddy, I've been playing this
mausoleum for a hundred years.

2:11:58.378 --> 2:11:59.852
How could we be broke?

2:11:59.988 --> 2:12:01.649
You spend
so much money.

2:12:01.785 --> 2:12:05.319
You know, you got the cars
and the girls and the clothes,

2:12:05.454 --> 2:12:07.486
and all the...
you know, new airplane.

2:12:07.622 --> 2:12:09.094
Daddy, you are
my business manager.

2:12:09.229 --> 2:12:10.624
You're supposed
to be taking care of business.

2:12:10.759 --> 2:12:13.422
I don't know what to tell you,
son, we're broke!

2:12:13.557 --> 2:12:15.162
We're plain broke.

2:12:15.297 --> 2:12:17.163
Gotta take the Colonel back.

2:12:17.299 --> 2:12:19.463
I am not taking him back.

2:12:19.598 --> 2:12:21.205
We're gonna lose Graceland.

2:12:33.788 --> 2:12:35.681
I am not taking him back!

2:12:38.826 --> 2:12:40.124
He takes everything from me.

2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:42.520
He takes 50%
of everything that I make!

2:12:42.655 --> 2:12:43.925
And now he wants
to take the home

2:12:44.061 --> 2:12:45.526
that we bought for Mama!

2:12:46.767 --> 2:12:47.933
Listen to me, Daddy.

2:12:48.069 --> 2:12:50.933
That old bastard
can sue if he wants,

2:12:51.068 --> 2:12:52.863
but I am flying away.

2:12:53.972 --> 2:12:55.503
With or without you.

2:13:05.515 --> 2:13:08.888
Oh, you bloodsucking,
old vampire.

2:13:09.024 --> 2:13:12.254
You bled me dry
and you still want more?

2:13:12.390 --> 2:13:14.653
I'm not an uncaring man,
Mr. Presley.

2:13:14.789 --> 2:13:17.757
Don't you "Mr. Presley" me,
you toad.

2:13:17.892 --> 2:13:20.933
If you are so determined
to get out of our contract--

2:13:21.069 --> 2:13:22.430
You're goddamn right
I want out.

2:13:22.566 --> 2:13:24.398
Well, I will personally
loan you the money

2:13:24.534 --> 2:13:26.434
that you owe
to Jamboree Attractions.

2:13:26.570 --> 2:13:28.237
Yeah, you'll still have
your claws in me.

2:13:28.373 --> 2:13:29.601
You'll still have me
working here

2:13:29.737 --> 2:13:31.570
like a goddamn slave
in a salt mine,

2:13:31.705 --> 2:13:34.036
you phony, no-good
piece of trash!

2:13:34.171 --> 2:13:37.743
I oughta shoot you in your fat,
goddamn face!

2:13:38.883 --> 2:13:40.147
Who are you?

2:13:40.283 --> 2:13:42.346
I am you. And you are me.

2:13:42.481 --> 2:13:43.981
Cut the horseshit!

2:13:44.116 --> 2:13:46.154
Everything I've ever known
about you has been a lie.

2:13:46.289 --> 2:13:47.887
E.P., you all good?

2:13:48.023 --> 2:13:52.488
My past is the least
of your problems, my boy.

2:13:52.623 --> 2:13:58.031
Everyone else
you associate with
lives from you, Mr. Presley.

2:13:58.166 --> 2:14:00.071
Even Vernon.

2:14:00.207 --> 2:14:03.199
That's right,
even your own daddy

2:14:03.335 --> 2:14:06.808
has looked after himself
before he's looked after you.

2:14:06.943 --> 2:14:09.881
Yes, I have lived
from you, too,
but the difference is

2:14:10.016 --> 2:14:11.779
you have also lived from me.

2:14:11.915 --> 2:14:16.613
We have supported each other.
Because we shared a dream.

2:14:16.748 --> 2:14:20.051
We are the same, you and I.

2:14:20.187 --> 2:14:25.626
We are two odd,
lonely children,
reaching for eternity.

2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:31.066
Maybe you should fly away,
my boy.

2:14:31.201 --> 2:14:35.040
Away from all of this.

2:14:35.176 --> 2:14:39.035
But if you do choose
to leave...

2:14:40.742 --> 2:14:44.112
then I, for one,
will be very lonely.

2:14:44.247 --> 2:14:46.810
So would your father.

2:14:46.946 --> 2:14:50.613
But I think you may
be lonely, too.

2:14:53.521 --> 2:14:56.556
Oh, you see, my boy, the...

2:14:56.692 --> 2:15:00.056
truth about
the Rock of Eternity...

2:15:03.369 --> 2:15:08.306
It is forever
just beyond our reach.

2:15:36.635 --> 2:15:41.339
<i>Do the chairs</i>
<i>in your parlor</i>

2:15:43.076 --> 2:15:46.773
<i>Seem empty and bare?</i>

2:15:49.074 --> 2:15:53.384
<i>Do you gaze</i>
<i>at your doorstep</i>

2:15:55.186 --> 2:15:58.653
<i>Picture me there?</i>

2:16:00.988 --> 2:16:05.396
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

2:16:06.726 --> 2:16:10.995
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:15.567
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2:16:15.703 --> 2:16:20.873
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2:16:22.878 --> 2:16:27.286
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

2:16:28.583 --> 2:16:32.885
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2:16:34.862 --> 2:16:37.358
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2:16:37.494 --> 2:16:43.434
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2:16:51.409 --> 2:16:54.511
Son, I know...
I know, I...

2:16:57.214 --> 2:16:59.208
I wanna try and...

2:17:00.883 --> 2:17:04.213
I wanna try and fix this.
You know...

2:17:08.256 --> 2:17:09.460
Daddy...

2:17:15.025 --> 2:17:17.259
Tell that son of a bitch...

2:17:17.394 --> 2:17:19.767
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

2:17:28.278 --> 2:17:29.282
And, Daddy...

2:17:31.979 --> 2:17:36.245
Tell the Colonel
to send up Dr. Nick.

2:17:54.465 --> 2:17:56.165
<i> It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>in Las Vegas,</i>

2:17:56.300 --> 2:17:57.705
<i>with lots going on</i>
<i>this weekend.</i>

2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:00.111
<i>Those teen sensations,</i>
<i>The Jacksons,</i>

2:18:00.246 --> 2:18:01.810
<i>are causing a lot of excitement</i>

2:18:01.945 --> 2:18:04.177
<i>with their residency</i>
<i>at the MGM Grand.</i>

2:18:04.313 --> 2:18:07.216
<i>And for the older crowd,</i>
<i>Elvis is back for a fifth year.</i>

2:18:07.351 --> 2:18:08.717
<i>And don't we love him.</i>

2:18:08.852 --> 2:18:10.547
<i>In Entertainment News today,</i>

2:18:10.682 --> 2:18:12.952
<i>Elvis Presley is in talks to</i>

2:18:13.087 --> 2:18:14.857
<i>in a remake</i>
<i>of</i> A Star is Born.

2:18:14.993 --> 2:18:16.425
<i> These days,</i>

2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:18.156
<i>on stage in Vegas or playing</i>

2:18:18.291 --> 2:18:20.456

<i>the singer spends weeks</i>

2:18:22.899 --> 2:18:24.801
<i>tormented by his</i>

2:18:24.937 --> 2:18:26.867
<i>Sounds like it won't be</i>
<i>much of a stretch for him</i>

2:18:27.002 --> 2:18:29.166
<i>to play the role</i>
<i>of a washed-up singer.</i>

2:18:32.806 --> 2:18:34.875
Oh, look, here they come.

2:18:37.309 --> 2:18:38.776
-Are you all right?
-Yep.

2:18:38.911 --> 2:18:40.516
All right, Daddy loves you.

2:18:40.652 --> 2:18:43.012
-Bye, baby.
-Come on, baby.

2:18:43.147 --> 2:18:44.489
-Bye, Papa.
-Good girl.

2:18:44.624 --> 2:18:46.656
-Bye, baby.
-Give me your hand.

2:18:47.828 --> 2:18:49.219
Hi!

2:18:49.355 --> 2:18:51.991
-Here she is.
-Hi, baby. How you doing?

2:18:54.829 --> 2:18:56.360
Want to say goodbye to Daddy?

2:18:56.496 --> 2:18:59.504
-Bye, Daddy.
-You're so good.

2:19:01.198 --> 2:19:03.667
Hi. How are you?
How you doing?

2:19:03.803 --> 2:19:05.169
We're okay.

2:19:24.524 --> 2:19:25.728
Hey.

2:19:27.032 --> 2:19:28.192
Hi.

2:19:30.762 --> 2:19:31.965
Hmm.

2:19:37.539 --> 2:19:39.071
How are you doing?

2:19:54.254 --> 2:19:57.424
Honey, there's this place
in San Diego

2:19:57.560 --> 2:19:59.157
that you can go to rest.

2:20:00.230 --> 2:20:01.898
To heal.

2:20:02.034 --> 2:20:03.892
After the show, you can fly
directly and be in a clinic

2:20:04.028 --> 2:20:05.069
before anyone knows.

2:20:05.205 --> 2:20:06.395
It's all been arranged.

2:20:08.804 --> 2:20:11.070
I'm gonna be 40 soon, 'Cilla.

2:20:13.905 --> 2:20:16.105
Forty.

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:18.583
And nobody's gonna remember me.

2:20:21.113 --> 2:20:23.115
I never did anything lasting.

2:20:25.618 --> 2:20:28.656
I never made that classic film
that I could be proud of.

2:20:28.791 --> 2:20:30.925
But what about<i> A Star is Born?</i>

2:20:32.925 --> 2:20:35.226
Uh...

2:20:37.270 --> 2:20:40.396
Barbra... the Colonel...

2:20:46.973 --> 2:20:49.981
Please go.

2:20:50.116 --> 2:20:52.274
For Lisa?

2:20:52.410 --> 2:20:54.817
If you dream it,
you can do it, baby.

2:20:57.048 --> 2:20:58.755
I'm all out of dreams.

2:21:01.325 --> 2:21:02.990
Promise me.

2:21:37.027 --> 2:21:40.698
I... will always... love you.

2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:01.719
-Hi, baby.

2:22:47.164 --> 2:22:49.533
<i> Did you know</i>
<i>there's a kind of bird</i>

2:22:49.668 --> 2:22:51.865
<i>that doesn't have any legs?</i>

2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:53.903
<i>So it can't land on nothing.</i>

2:22:56.205 --> 2:22:58.303
<i>It lives its whole life</i>
<i>on the wing.</i>

2:23:00.881 --> 2:23:04.644
When it gets tired,
it just spreads its wings

2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:07.147
and sleeps on the wind.

2:23:10.089 --> 2:23:13.450
<i>If it ever does land,</i>
<i>even but one time...</i>

2:23:16.186 --> 2:23:17.795
<i>so it dies.</i>

2:23:21.260 --> 2:23:22.657
<i> Good evening.</i>

2:23:22.793 --> 2:23:25.934
<i>Elvis Presley died today.</i>
<i>He was 42.</i>

2:23:26.070 --> 2:23:27.838
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>it was a heart attack.</i>

2:23:27.973 --> 2:23:29.833
<i>He was found in his home</i>
<i>in Memphis...</i>

2:23:29.968 --> 2:23:32.040
<i> President Carter</i>
<i>has just made a statement...</i>

2:23:32.176 --> 2:23:33.669
<i>Elvis Presley's death</i>

2:23:33.804 --> 2:23:36.109
<i>deprives our country</i>
<i>of a part of itself.</i>

2:23:36.244 --> 2:23:37.872
<i>He was unique</i>
<i>and irreplaceable.</i>

2:23:38.008 --> 2:23:39.475
<i> Thousands</i>
<i>of mourners have gathered</i>

2:23:39.611 --> 2:23:41.017
<i>outside the gates</i>
<i>of Graceland...</i>

2:23:41.152 --> 2:23:42.685
<i> Using the styles</i>
<i>of white country</i>

2:23:42.820 --> 2:23:44.650
<i>and Black rhythm and blues,</i>

2:23:44.785 --> 2:23:47.391
<i>permanently changed the face</i>
<i>of American popular culture.</i>

2:23:47.527 --> 2:23:49.785
<i> The outpouring</i>
<i>of grief can be seen</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

2:23:49.921 --> 2:23:52.621
<i> He was a symbol</i>
<i>to people the world over,</i>

2:23:52.756 --> 2:23:55.665
<i>of the vitality,</i>
<i>rebelliousness...</i>

2:23:55.800 --> 2:23:58.836
<i> What killed my boy?</i>

2:23:58.971 --> 2:24:02.065
<i>Them doctors say</i>
<i>it was his heart.</i>

2:24:02.200 --> 2:24:04.540
<i>Others, the pills.</i>

2:24:04.676 --> 2:24:08.076
<i>Some say it was me.</i>

2:24:08.211 --> 2:24:11.849
<i>No. I'll tell you</i>
<i>what killed him.</i>

2:24:13.144 --> 2:24:16.178
<i>It was love.</i>

2:24:16.313 --> 2:24:18.587
<i>His love for you.</i>

2:24:21.125 --> 2:24:23.662
<i>You know, a few weeks</i>
<i>before he died,</i>

2:24:23.798 --> 2:24:27.696
<i>I saw him sing</i>
<i>for the very last time.</i>

2:24:27.832 --> 2:24:29.999
<i>He could barely stand up.</i>

2:24:31.295 --> 2:24:33.970
"Unchained Melody."

2:24:34.105 --> 2:24:37.369
From an album called
<i>Unchained Melody.</i>

2:24:37.504 --> 2:24:41.375
Makes a lot of sense. Okay.

2:24:41.511 --> 2:24:45.979
<i> But that night,</i>
<i>he sang as he always did.</i>

2:24:46.114 --> 2:24:48.319
<i>With all his heart and soul.</i>

2:24:48.455 --> 2:24:49.913
How you like it so far?

2:24:53.024 --> 2:24:56.389
<i> That old voice</i>
<i>rang out,</i>

2:24:56.524 --> 2:25:01.057
<i>-and he sang with all his life.</i>

2:25:01.192 --> 2:25:06.534
<i>Oh, my love</i>

2:25:06.670 --> 2:25:08.870
<i>My darling</i>

2:25:09.006 --> 2:25:13.169
<i>I've hungered</i>
<i>for your touch</i>

2:25:13.305 --> 2:25:19.015
<i>A long, lonely time</i>

2:25:21.883 --> 2:25:27.390
<i>Time goes by</i>

2:25:27.526 --> 2:25:30.054
<i>So slowly</i>

2:25:30.190 --> 2:25:34.330
<i>And time can do so much</i>

2:25:34.466 --> 2:25:36.730
<i>Are you</i>

2:25:36.865 --> 2:25:41.230
<i>Still mine?</i>

2:25:41.366 --> 2:25:48.275
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2:25:49.549 --> 2:25:54.452
<i>I need your love</i>

2:25:54.588 --> 2:26:00.016
<i>God speed your love</i>

2:26:00.151 --> 2:26:04.588
<i>To me</i>

2:26:06.297 --> 2:26:13.363
<i>Lonely rivers flow to the sea</i>
<i>To the sea</i>

2:26:13.498 --> 2:26:19.607
<i>To the open arms of the sea</i>

2:26:22.074 --> 2:26:28.986
<i>Lonely rivers cry</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>

2:26:29.986 --> 2:26:33.292
<i>I'll be coming home</i>

2:26:33.427 --> 2:26:38.496
<i>Wait for me</i>

2:26:38.632 --> 2:26:43.965
<i>My love, my darling</i>

2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:48.632
<i>I've hungered for your kiss</i>

2:26:49.676 --> 2:26:55.875
<i>A long, lonely time</i>

2:26:56.010 --> 2:26:57.443
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2:26:57.578 --> 2:26:59.775
<i>I was a dreamer.</i>
<i>I read comic books</i>

2:26:59.911 --> 2:27:02.514
<i>and I was the hero</i>
<i>of the comic book.</i>

2:27:02.650 --> 2:27:05.956
<i>I saw movies and I was</i>
<i>the hero in the movie.</i>

2:27:06.092 --> 2:27:08.055
<i>So every dream</i>
<i>that I ever dreamed</i>

2:27:08.190 --> 2:27:10.456
has come true
a hundred times.

2:27:12.127 --> 2:27:18.794
<i>Are you still mine?</i>

2:27:20.366 --> 2:27:27.308
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2:27:30.544 --> 2:27:32.916
I learned very early
in life that...

2:27:33.052 --> 2:27:36.019
"Without a song,
the day would never end,

2:27:36.155 --> 2:27:38.780
without a song,
a man ain't got a friend,

2:27:38.916 --> 2:27:42.019
without a song,
the road would never bend,

2:27:42.154 --> 2:27:43.187
without a song."

2:27:43.323 --> 2:27:45.088
So I keep singing a song.

2:27:45.223 --> 2:27:47.892
<i>To...</i>

2:27:48.028 --> 2:27:51.093
<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

2:27:51.229 --> 2:27:55.072
<i>Ooh</i>

2:27:55.771 --> 2:27:57.100
<i>Me</i>

2:28:37.350 --> 2:28:40.084
<i>Elvis has left the building.</i>

2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:00.335
<i>As the snow flies</i>

2:29:02.274 --> 2:29:05.175
<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

2:29:05.310 --> 2:29:07.512
<i>A poor little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

2:29:07.647 --> 2:29:09.311
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2:29:12.818 --> 2:29:16.285
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2:29:18.425 --> 2:29:21.420
<i>'Cause if there's one thing</i>
<i>that she don't need</i>

2:29:21.556 --> 2:29:24.155
<i>Is another hungry mouth</i>
<i>to feed</i>

2:29:24.290 --> 2:29:26.361
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2:29:29.232 --> 2:29:31.702
<i>People, don't you understand</i>

2:29:31.838 --> 2:29:35.163
<i>The child needs a helping hand</i>

2:29:35.299 --> 2:29:39.843
<i>Or he'll grow to be</i>
<i>an angry young man some day</i>

2:29:39.979 --> 2:29:42.307
<i>Take a look at you and me</i>

2:29:42.442 --> 2:29:45.877
<i>Are we too blind to see?</i>

2:29:46.013 --> 2:29:51.815
<i>Do we simply turn our heads</i>
<i>And look the other way</i>

2:29:53.519 --> 2:29:57.557
<i>Well, the world turns...</i>

2:30:06.804 --> 2:30:09.498
<i> "You never</i>
<i>stood in that man's shoes</i>

2:30:09.634 --> 2:30:12.034
<i>Or saw things through his eyes</i>

2:30:12.169 --> 2:30:14.603
<i>Or stood and watched</i>
<i>with helpless hands</i>

2:30:14.738 --> 2:30:17.543
<i>While the heart inside you dies</i>

2:30:17.679 --> 2:30:20.345
<i>So help your brother</i>
<i>along the way</i>

2:30:20.481 --> 2:30:23.220
<i>No matter where he starts</i>

2:30:23.356 --> 2:30:28.717
<i>For the same God that made you</i>
<i>Made him, too</i>

2:30:28.852 --> 2:30:31.261
<i>These men with broken hearts"</i>

2:30:32.865 --> 2:30:36.134
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2:30:38.504 --> 2:30:41.272
<i>And a hungry, little boy</i>
<i>with a runny nose</i>

2:30:41.407 --> 2:30:43.773
<i>Plays in the street</i>
<i>as the cold wind blows</i>

2:30:43.908 --> 2:30:45.539
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2:30:49.014 --> 2:30:52.711
<i>And his hunger burns</i>

2:30:54.354 --> 2:30:57.378
<i>So he starts to roam</i>
<i>the streets at night</i>

2:30:57.514 --> 2:30:59.855
<i>And he learns how to steal</i>
<i>And he learns how to fight</i>

2:30:59.990 --> 2:31:01.918
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2:31:05.731 --> 2:31:10.935
<i>Then one night in desperation</i>
<i>The young man breaks away</i>

2:31:11.070 --> 2:31:13.632
<i>He buys a gun, steals a car</i>

2:31:13.768 --> 2:31:16.906
<i>Tries to run,</i>
<i>but he don't get far</i>

2:31:17.041 --> 2:31:20.772
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2:31:45.162 --> 2:31:48.029
<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

2:31:48.165 --> 2:31:51.676
<i>Another little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

2:31:51.811 --> 2:31:53.640
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2:32:04.088 --> 2:32:07.192
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2:32:21.932 --> 2:32:25.870
<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2:32:30.809 --> 2:32:35.184
<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2:32:35.319 --> 2:32:39.685
<i>That was what she gave to me</i>

2:32:39.821 --> 2:32:43.685
<i>Never thought</i>
<i>I'd travel all alone</i>

2:32:43.821 --> 2:32:49.993
<i>The trail of memories</i>

2:35:23.817 --> 2:35:26.016
<i>Don't tiptoe, stomp my ground</i>

2:35:26.152 --> 2:35:28.553
<i>Gotta let 'em know</i>
<i>we're comin'</i>

2:35:28.688 --> 2:35:30.456
<i>Just stay there, woman</i>

2:35:30.592 --> 2:35:32.397
<i>Engine still runnin'</i>

2:35:32.532 --> 2:35:36.466
<i>Get dressed</i>
<i>Like the whole world watchin'</i>

2:35:36.602 --> 2:35:39.829
<i>God bless</i>
<i>Gotta leave 'em shooken</i>

2:35:39.965 --> 2:35:42.039
<i>Girls goin' wild, too cray</i>

2:35:42.175 --> 2:35:44.201
<i>Look at what you made</i>

2:35:44.336 --> 2:35:47.979
<i>Always come correct</i>
<i>There's no turnin' back</i>

2:35:48.115 --> 2:35:50.080
<i>Takin' bigger steps</i>

2:35:50.216 --> 2:35:52.047
<i>That's all I can do</i>

2:35:52.182 --> 2:35:55.679
<i>That's all for the moment</i>
<i>If that's all right with you</i>

2:35:55.814 --> 2:35:57.880
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

2:35:58.016 --> 2:36:00.057
<i>That's all right with you</i>

2:36:00.192 --> 2:36:01.884
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

2:36:02.019 --> 2:36:04.693
<i>Anyway you do, that's all right</i>

2:36:05.527 --> 2:36:07.421
<i>That's all right</i>

2:36:07.557 --> 2:36:12.762
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

2:36:12.898 --> 2:36:16.535
<i>We can't go on together</i>

2:36:16.671 --> 2:36:19.103
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

2:36:21.105 --> 2:36:25.049
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

2:36:25.185 --> 2:36:28.145
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

2:36:48.204 --> 2:36:54.402
<i>There must be peace</i>
<i>and understanding sometime</i>

2:36:55.875 --> 2:36:57.912
<i>Strong winds of promise</i>

2:36:58.047 --> 2:37:03.483
<i>That will blow away</i>
<i>the doubt and fear</i>

2:37:03.619 --> 2:37:07.888
<i>If I can dream of a warmer sun</i>

2:37:08.024 --> 2:37:11.458
<i>Where hope keeps shining</i>
<i>on everyone</i>

2:37:11.594 --> 2:37:15.090
<i>Tell me why, oh, why,</i>

2:37:15.225 --> 2:37:22.067
<i>Oh, why won't that sun appear</i>

2:37:28.105 --> 2:37:30.812
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

2:37:31.910 --> 2:37:35.747
<i>With too much rain</i>

2:37:35.882 --> 2:37:39.421
<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

2:37:39.557 --> 2:37:43.288
<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

2:37:43.424 --> 2:37:49.331
<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

2:37:49.467 --> 2:37:56.365
<i>He can redeem his soul and fly</i>

2:37:58.275 --> 2:38:01.141
<i>Oh...</i>

2:38:01.277 --> 2:38:07.046
<i>Deep in my heart,</i>
<i>there's a trembling question</i>

2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:12.321
<i>Still I am sure</i>
<i>that the answers</i>

2:38:12.457 --> 2:38:15.826
<i>The answers gonna come somehow</i>

2:38:15.961 --> 2:38:23.568
<i>Out there in the dark,</i>
<i>there's a beckoning candle</i>

2:38:23.703 --> 2:38:27.528
<i>And while I can think,</i>
<i>while I can talk</i>

2:38:27.663 --> 2:38:31.736
<i>While I can stand,</i>
<i>while I can walk</i>

2:38:31.871 --> 2:38:34.403
<i>While I can dream</i>

2:38:35.414 --> 2:38:38.110
<i>Please let my dream</i>

2:38:39.317 --> 2:38:43.687
<i>Come true</i>

2:38:46.885 --> 2:38:50.723
<i>Right now</i>

2:38:50.859 --> 2:38:53.191
<i>Let it come true right now</i>

2:38:54.232 --> 2:38:58.196
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

2:39:03.370 --> 2:39:04.841
-<i> Thank you.</i>

2:39:04.976 --> 2:39:06.435
<i>You're fantastic.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
