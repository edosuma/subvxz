WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.966
Lupe, Max will be here soon.

00:08.049 --> 00:12.262
Have you finished packing
for your romantic  vacación?

00:12.345 --> 00:14.514
Almost. But we're gonna have to stop
at the outlet mall

00:14.597 --> 00:18.184
on the way to Palm Springs because
the only desert wear I have is this.

00:20.645 --> 00:24.232
You need clothing?
What kind of romantic  vacación  is this?

00:24.941 --> 00:29.029
-The kind that won't get us arrested.
-That happened one time.

00:30.822 --> 00:36.036
Ay,  Elena, your homecoming dance
is only 36 hours away.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.831
If I pluck your eyebrows
with both hands...

00:40.957 --> 00:43.501
I may be able to separate them in time.

00:46.171 --> 00:50.717
School dances are barbaric events designed
to make less popular kids feel bad.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.635
They're for total narcissists.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.803
Okay, eyes on me.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.434
How fly are my vintage threads
for the dance?

00:59.517 --> 01:00.351
[Penelope] Ooh.

01:00.435 --> 01:05.231
Papito,  you look so handsome
in your  abuelo's  outfit.

01:05.315 --> 01:10.236
-Who did you decide to go with?
-This older girl, Emma. She's older.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.281
By two months.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.408
Okay. Well, she had an epic big ask.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.744
It is not polite to talk about
your girlfriend's  fondillo,

01:17.827 --> 01:19.621
no matter how big it is.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.499
No,  Abuelita.  "Big ask."

01:22.582 --> 01:24.918
It's the way kids invite each other
to dances now.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.629
It's a whole obnoxious performance.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.632
I am so glad Syd is home-schooled
and not into this stuff.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.549
[knocking on door]

01:32.050 --> 01:35.178
Oh, hey, Syd. What's happening?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.681
I don't know, but I think Syd is wearing
their grandpa's outfit too.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.830

-Shut up!

02:44.831 --> 02:46.166
[theme song playing]

03:34.881 --> 03:36.257
I am ready.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.053
I thought we were going away
for the weekend,

03:40.136 --> 03:42.305
but are we moving to Palm Springs?

03:42.388 --> 03:45.433
No. This one's empty. Yeah.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.978
It's for the mini shampoos and soaps
we're gonna snag from the hotel.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.857
And this is for the free breakfast
we're gonna swipe

03:52.941 --> 03:54.859
so we don't have to spend money on lunch.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.906
I'll pay for lunch.
Maybe even splurge for Quiznos.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.825
Damn, I didn't know
I was dating a rich guy.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.743
[scoffs]

04:04.244 --> 04:07.789
Plus he is charming, he's sexy, he's tan.

04:07.872 --> 04:12.585
He claims to be a  gringo,
but all signs point to  cubano.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.629
-[chuckles]
-[knocking on door]

04:14.712 --> 04:16.923
Don't answer,
it's probably another bad singer.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.007
[laughs]

04:25.556 --> 04:27.058
Little privacy here?

04:28.226 --> 04:29.060
You knocked!

04:29.143 --> 04:32.397
Oh, yeah. Nikki has some stuff
she wants to tell you.

"Don't be picky, vote for Nikki."

04:45.243 --> 04:47.287
It is my duty to inform you

04:47.370 --> 04:50.832
you failed to complete
your mandatory family volunteer hours.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.792
-You done? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

04:52.875 --> 04:53.835
Oh, stop that!

04:53.918 --> 04:56.587
I'm sorry.
I'll make the hours up soon, okay?

04:56.671 --> 04:58.965
Okay, but... Uh-uh.
The deadline is Sunday.

04:59.048 --> 05:03.094
But lucky you! I'm short on chaperones
for homecoming tomorrow.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.680
Come get your salsa on,  chica.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.141
That's not convincing me.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.184
But I can't,
because we're going to Palm Springs.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.978
So you can just pay the fine.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.023
It's $50 an hour.
And you're behind 20 hours.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.607
So it's $1,000, no bigs.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.735
What? I don't have that kind of money.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.196
I packed these so we could
soft boil them in the Jacuzzi.

05:26.367 --> 05:31.039
I guess I'll see you at homecoming then.
It counts for five hours. Bye! [chuckles]

05:34.584 --> 05:35.960
I'm not voting for her.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.297
-[pop song playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

05:40.173 --> 05:43.176
Whoa!

05:43.259 --> 05:47.388
School-schools are way bigger
than home schools.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.726
I can't believe it has its own ballroom.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.520
This is a gym.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.273
What?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.567
I'm gonna hit the restroom.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.571
I cannot wait to meet all of your friends.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.157
All of your friends?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.576
Yeah, so, um...

06:09.577 --> 06:12.830
Syd kinda thinks I'm really popular.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.540
[chuckles] Oh...

06:17.126 --> 06:19.837
Wow! Love really is blind.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.717
Why would Syd think you're popular?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.887
-You're only friends with the teachers.
-And the principal!

06:29.597 --> 06:30.681
I just...

06:30.765 --> 06:33.810
I maybe didn't correct
some false assumptions.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.187
Syd knows I'm president of a lot of clubs

06:36.270 --> 06:39.232
and it's not my fault
people hate powerful women.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.025
The same thing happened to Hillary.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.112
You can't say that about everything.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.825
-Okay, how will you pull this off?
-With this.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.536
I can skim Facebook,
Instagram and Snapchat

06:51.619 --> 06:53.871
and find a few facts
about these ding-dongs

06:53.955 --> 06:55.331
to make it seem like we're friends.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.919
I'm gonna talk to my actual friends,
but I'm gonna leave you with this thought.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.213
Maybe you're the ding-dong.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.721
I'm sorry we're not sippin' margaritas
by a pool right now.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.890
I had my blender packed and everything.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.145
So that was the buzzing
coming from your suitcase.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.315
-I was worried slash excited.
-Oh!

07:22.233 --> 07:23.568
Well, thank you for doing this.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.071
With your five hours, my mom's five hours,
I'm almost caught up.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.281
Happy to be here.

07:29.031 --> 07:29.907
[grunts]

07:29.991 --> 07:32.702
God! This place takes me back.

07:32.785 --> 07:38.332
My first homecoming dance, Sister Barbara
caught me hiding boxed wine in my top.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.751
She did not buy "My boobs are square."

07:40.835 --> 07:42.086
[laughs]

07:42.170 --> 07:45.882
It's like she had a way of sneaking up
and yelling at me with her demonic voice.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.842
-Hello, Penelope.
-[exclaims in Spanish]

07:49.469 --> 07:51.679
Hi. Hi.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.975
Hi, Sister Barbara.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.896
That's a very red dress.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.858
And also, I see your bosoms
have rounded out.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.651
[laughs] Oh...

08:05.735 --> 08:08.237
We had our fun, didn't we, Sister Barbara?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.282
I know I was a bad girl,
but I'm a nurse now.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.160
And I was in the army.
I turned out pretty okay.

08:14.243 --> 08:18.414
Oh, that's nice. Pride is a sin.

08:22.335 --> 08:27.006
You know, all chaperones
are required to wear black.

08:27.089 --> 08:31.969
Did you receive my e-mail?
I sent it through the Internet.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.973
Oh, I don't use e-mail.
That's the devil's work. [chuckles]

08:37.266 --> 08:40.394
No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.064
Anyway. I... This is Max.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.400
Thank you for helping out today, Max.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.407
Oh, bless. Is he simple?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.870
Well, the Lord made you strong.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.083
[scoffs] What the hell was that?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.460
Sorry, I have a thing for nuns.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.714
-You do?
-Yeah.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.093
Small women that boss you around,
make you do stuff. Hot.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.805
Why do you think I like you so much?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.098
[chuckles]

09:18.224 --> 09:21.519
Hello, Sister Barbara.
Blessed be the fruit.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.902
I'd like to introduce you to Schneider,
my boyfriend.

09:34.073 --> 09:38.494
Yep, I'm her boyfriend,
which is not news to me.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.458
We're not married yet, but we've promised
ourselves to each other.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.423
Wonderful.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.925
Is everyone ready for their assignments?

09:53.009 --> 09:56.137
Oh, yeah, yeah. Hey.
How about if Max and I do dance patrol?

09:56.220 --> 09:58.931
We all know what goes on
in the middle of a dance floor.

09:59.849 --> 10:04.687
The farther you are from the chaperones,
the freakier the freakin' gets.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.941
We have a strict anti-freaking policy.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.654
I don't think the situation
would be helped by you in that dress.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.951
Well, I don't have another dress,
so what do we do?

10:24.373 --> 10:25.207
Hey, Mom.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.794
This is Emma.

10:30.296 --> 10:34.300
Emma? Your teenage date?

10:34.967 --> 10:35.968
Nice to meet you.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.097
How is she in ninth grade?

10:40.181 --> 10:43.851
Was she held back? Like, nine times?

10:45.269 --> 10:46.562
Seems like it, right?

10:48.356 --> 10:49.774

Hey, Connor.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.755
Remember when you had so much fun
in Cancun in 2007? [chuckles]

11:12.838 --> 11:16.092
I mean, you pet a stingray? Crazy!

11:16.175 --> 11:18.386
Elena, how come I never met these guys?

11:18.469 --> 11:20.638
You don't know my life.
Just take the picture.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.431
[camera shutter clicks]

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
-Got it.
-Hi, I'm Syd--

11:24.183 --> 11:27.311
Okay. Tag me when you post it.
Jay-Z is your favorite artist.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.648
You guys want one without her?

[cell phone ringing]

11:36.737 --> 11:38.447
Oh. Hello?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.117
I cannot stop looking at you
in that nun outfit.

11:45.788 --> 11:49.083
-It is a choir robe.
-Eh, I can make it work.

11:50.167 --> 11:54.672
See, this sucks. I like to be near you
when you're being pervy. Oh, I gotta go.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.257
Okay. I love you.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.885
You what? Hello? What? What? What?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.054
Oh, hi, Penelope.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.641
Hey, Doc. Thanks for coming on such
short notice. You're my last five hours.

12:05.724 --> 12:10.020
Of course. I have never been
to a school dance before.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.982
My mother was afraid
I'd contract mononucleosis.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.484
I never did.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.987
Aw... [chuckles]

12:18.070 --> 12:19.989
Could you take over the photo booth
for a minute?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.907
-I need to talk to Max.
-Sure.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.993
Finally, I get to hang with the cool kids.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.911
Like this guy.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.375
-Lupe?
-What?

12:31.459 --> 12:34.170
Why is Leslie here?
Is he stalking me?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.965
I asked him to come help finish my hours.
I didn't think you'd mind.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.092
You said you were okay
with him dating someone new.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.345
Of course I'm okay.
It's him I am worried about.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.098
I mean, seeing me look this fabulous?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.518
It is so cruel.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.271
Where are you going?

12:52.354 --> 12:55.399
Mami,  I think I just heard
Max say he loves me.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.818
-Why are you still standing here? Run!
-[chuckles]

12:59.111 --> 13:00.029
-Pen!
-What?

13:00.112 --> 13:03.365
Oh, thank God. Did you hear
what Nikki said to Sister Barbara?

13:03.449 --> 13:06.827
-She thinks I'm her boyfriend?
-I can't stress how little I care.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.787
I know!
I can't stop thinking about it either.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.583
On one hand, Nikki is a terrible person.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.711
On the other hand,
is it time for me to get married?

13:16.587 --> 13:17.546
[sighs]

13:17.630 --> 13:20.591
Excited to see this next chapter
of your life unfold. Bye!

13:22.218 --> 13:23.469
Hello, you.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.806
Hey. I'm just keeping an eye
on Alex and his date.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.188
He got pulled
into the booty-dancing jungle

13:34.271 --> 13:37.525
and a loose woman told me
that's where the freaking takes place.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.028
Hey, good looking out.
