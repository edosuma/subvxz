00:00.028 --> 00:01.534
Callie: Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.577 --> 00:04.171
Arbiter is responsible
for the death of Jack.

00:04.216 --> 00:06.149
Justina Marks works for Arbiter.

00:06.184 --> 00:07.839
You were having sex
with your foster brother.

00:07.873 --> 00:10.502
- We're gonna fight this.
- We can't because it's true.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.394
Is Nick Stratos in school today?

00:12.416 --> 00:14.890
I saw Nick, and he seemed really weird.

00:14.929 --> 00:17.158
You said you weren't going to surprise me.

00:17.164 --> 00:19.344
Nick's got a gun. We've got
to lock down this school now.

00:19.359 --> 00:20.407
Let's get everyone in the office.

00:20.443 --> 00:22.259
Get those blinds. I need this table

00:22.288 --> 00:23.632
in front of this door right now.

00:23.653 --> 00:25.312
Let me in please. It... it's Mariana.

00:25.431 --> 00:27.676
- (gunshot, screaming)
- Get down! Get down!

00:27.704 --> 00:29.265
Officer: We swept the entire school.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.931
No sign of the Stratos kid anywhere.

00:30.969 --> 00:32.198
Lena: So, where the hell is he?

00:35.162 --> 00:37.320
How do you know Nick had a gun?

00:37.354 --> 00:39.036
We don't know that.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.991
His father owns one,
and it's missing, so...

00:42.046 --> 00:43.862
But that doesn't mean that Nick took it.

00:43.981 --> 00:45.356
He burned down the warehouse.

00:45.384 --> 00:46.823
Yeah, but do we know that for sure?

00:46.942 --> 00:48.128
Why are you defending him?

00:48.149 --> 00:50.384
Let... Everybody, let's just please be

00:50.618 --> 00:52.304
nice to each other, shall we?

00:52.359 --> 00:53.671
So, did you talk to Nick?

00:53.682 --> 00:55.613
I mean, he said he was looking for you.

00:55.911 --> 00:57.101
Yeah.

00:57.323 --> 01:00.204
So, what did he say? Was he
upset about something, or...

01:00.325 --> 01:03.221
He saw me and Mat in
the garage last night.

01:03.579 --> 01:04.686
Doing what?

01:06.069 --> 01:08.959
Mat told me that he wanted to
get back together with me, but

01:09.710 --> 01:11.471
I told him no because I
didn't want to hurt Nick.

01:11.498 --> 01:12.971
So, why'd he freak out?

01:14.459 --> 01:16.185
Because he saw us kiss goodbye.

01:17.408 --> 01:19.427
Who kisses goodbye, Mariana?

01:19.438 --> 01:22.409
I... I told Nick that I wasn't
getting back together with Mat,

01:22.420 --> 01:25.138
- but he didn't believe me.
- Yeah, I don't believe you either.

01:25.156 --> 01:26.093
Stef: Jesus, enough.

01:26.126 --> 01:28.340
No, did you see the way they
ran into each other's arms?

01:28.367 --> 01:30.662
- Whose side are you on?
- We're all on your side, honey.

01:30.728 --> 01:32.134
Why did that teacher have a gun?

01:32.421 --> 01:34.264
'Cause he's an idiot, that's why.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.625
Jude: What happened to him?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.522
He was... he was arrested.

01:38.093 --> 01:40.145
Why were you in a 7th grade classroom?

01:40.969 --> 01:44.218
Uh, well we... we were
just in the hallway talking

01:44.240 --> 01:45.942
when everything went down.

01:46.063 --> 01:48.384
You don't think he'd come here...

01:48.433 --> 01:50.635
- Nick, do you?
- Stef: No, no. Absolutely not.

01:50.674 --> 01:53.528
We've got the entire San Diego
P.D. out there looking for him.

01:53.557 --> 01:55.421
They're gonna find him very soon, okay?

01:55.454 --> 01:58.006
So, in the meantime, we'll just stay put.

01:58.390 --> 02:00.379
All right? Sit tight.

02:00.793 --> 02:02.724
Keep all the doors locked
just so we feel safe,

02:02.742 --> 02:05.016
and I really don't want any of you guys

02:05.033 --> 02:06.533
on your phones or computers, please.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.161
- Why not?
- Because there's gonna be a lot of gossip

02:09.193 --> 02:11.074
and misinformation out there,

02:11.103 --> 02:12.912
and I don't want any of
you to be a part of it.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.318
And you know what? Just
so you're not tempted,

02:14.356 --> 02:15.516
why don't you give me your phones

02:15.533 --> 02:16.911
and go upstairs and get
your computers, please.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.947
No, what are we gonna
do without our phones?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.112
- Read a book.
- Yeah, we read books on our phones.

02:21.131 --> 02:22.228
Stef: Jesus, let's go.

02:22.246 --> 02:24.322
- Can we play computer games?
- If you can somehow manage

02:24.350 --> 02:26.021
to play them without
computers, knock yourself out.

02:26.069 --> 02:28.712
Mine's broken anyway. I
dropped it in the toilet.

02:29.643 --> 02:30.877
Post-flush.

02:30.903 --> 02:33.348
- You're supposed to put it in a bag of rice.
- Got it. Thank you.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.496
You guys, before you all
head up to your rooms,

02:35.539 --> 02:37.920
we're probably all still in some shock,

02:37.965 --> 02:40.081
so if feelings come up later, which I'm

02:40.115 --> 02:41.474
sure they probably will,

02:41.704 --> 02:42.989
I want us to talk about it, okay?

02:43.015 --> 02:44.472
No... no shutting down.

02:45.153 --> 02:47.079
And to that end, no closed doors.

02:47.122 --> 02:48.722
All right? I want all door open, please.

02:48.841 --> 02:50.036
Even the bathroom doors?

02:50.067 --> 02:52.058
No, Mariana, you can
close those for privacy.

02:52.094 --> 02:54.161
Now go ahead upstairs.
Bring down your computers.

- So, do you want to...
- No.

03:00.937 --> 03:02.572
No, not right now, please.

03:02.743 --> 03:04.090
Talk later.

03:04.770 --> 03:06.834
Well, can I get my
keyboard from the garage?

03:06.842 --> 03:09.348
Yes, B, but I locked it,

03:09.361 --> 03:11.361
so please make sure that
you re-lock it behind you.

03:15.367 --> 03:16.688
- You okay?
- Yeah.

03:16.754 --> 03:18.322
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

03:20.509 --> 03:21.849
You really think it's necessary

03:21.862 --> 03:23.801
to take their phones and computers?

03:23.828 --> 03:24.885
(sighs)

03:24.921 --> 03:26.141
What if Nick tries to get in touch

03:26.170 --> 03:27.560
with Mariana or Jesus?

03:27.586 --> 03:29.215
You don't think they would tell us?

03:29.335 --> 03:30.675
I'm not gonna risk it.

03:31.048 --> 03:33.879
Plus, with everything that's
going around on Fost and Found.

03:33.929 --> 03:36.026
- How did Justina even find out about...
- She didn't.

03:36.072 --> 03:39.692
She posted it, and just assumed
correctly, unfortunately.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.656
Oh, what are we gonna do?

03:43.312 --> 03:44.975
There's not much we can do

03:45.025 --> 03:47.224
with everyone in the
house right now, so...

03:48.365 --> 03:50.447
I do want to let you
know that I... I asked

03:50.468 --> 03:53.539
for a car to be stationed
outside tonight, okay?

03:54.522 --> 03:56.007
So, you do think that
he's gonna show up here...

03:56.014 --> 03:56.949
Probably not.

03:57.493 --> 03:58.945
But he is unstable,

03:58.980 --> 04:01.747
and I want us to be prepared for anything.

- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:05.244 --> 06:07.187
Look, Stef... Stef said I could come up.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.596
- I hope... I hope it's okay.
- Yeah.

06:10.175 --> 06:12.812
I heard about the lockdown.

06:15.394 --> 06:17.060
How you doing?

06:21.418 --> 06:23.271
Fine.

06:24.661 --> 06:27.442
- You been on Fost and Found lately?
- Yeah.

06:27.718 --> 06:29.723
So, you know what people have been sayin'?

06:30.685 --> 06:32.552
What have people been saying?

06:37.975 --> 06:40.278
Y'all do know there's a
drought going on, right?

06:41.031 --> 06:42.271
Callie: We shouldn't be doing this.

06:42.305 --> 06:44.151
We're not even supposed
to be on our computers.

06:44.656 --> 06:48.346
Our computers. They didn't
say anything about AJ's.

06:50.399 --> 06:51.731
Hey!

06:52.064 --> 06:53.308
Sorry.

06:53.428 --> 06:55.591
- I can't get in.
- I figured.

06:56.269 --> 06:58.629
Mariana: (sighs) This is not fair.

06:58.677 --> 07:00.012
We created Fost and Found.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.706
Justina has no right to lock us out.

07:01.826 --> 07:03.843
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

07:04.036 --> 07:06.507
People are saying that you slept
with your brother. It's disgusting.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.966
And Justina's monitors aren't
letting anyone on to defend you.

07:10.086 --> 07:11.370
I should head back.

07:12.353 --> 07:14.836
- She's trying to destroy your reputation.
- It's over, okay?

07:15.168 --> 07:17.567
We lost Fost and Found. There's
nothing we can do about it.

07:19.379 --> 07:20.961
Fine.

07:21.014 --> 07:22.906
If you don't care.

07:26.336 --> 07:27.927
Do you mind?

07:31.793 --> 07:34.290
Look, it's none of my business

07:34.547 --> 07:36.228
or anyone else's,

07:36.891 --> 07:38.682
but whatever went down...

07:43.067 --> 07:46.319
I saw how Brandon was with
Cortney at his birthday.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.762
And I know nothing's goin' on anymore.

07:51.831 --> 07:53.228
I should've believed you.

07:53.497 --> 07:54.985
I'm sorry.

07:57.031 --> 08:00.387
Um, I just can't really
think straight right now.

08:02.461 --> 08:03.781
I know.

08:04.995 --> 08:06.428
But, when you can...

08:11.877 --> 08:14.334
(wind howling)

08:15.281 --> 08:17.317
(music plays from television)

08:17.437 --> 08:21.893
Jesus: I can't believe you guys
are making us watch a G-rated film

08:22.012 --> 08:25.343
- starring a worm.
- It's hard to find a movie without guns.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.968
- Yes, or sex.
- I love this movie.

08:26.981 --> 08:28.593
Yeah, you would.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.066
Okay, just because I didn't cut
class to have sex in a car...

08:32.072 --> 08:34.086
- Mariana.
- You're grounded, by the way.

08:34.086 --> 08:35.243
And that's different from this, how?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.256
So, am I, like, the only one
in this house not having sex?

08:37.278 --> 08:39.889
- You're 14.
- Can we please watch the movie?

08:39.903 --> 08:41.203
Yeah, who ate all the popcorn?

08:41.238 --> 08:42.248
- You did!
- You did!

08:42.283 --> 08:44.095
- I will make more.
- No, no, don't...

08:44.096 --> 08:45.019
- don't leave me alone with them please!
- No, no, no,

08:45.042 --> 08:46.923
you're on your own. I'll be right back.

08:48.139 --> 08:49.673
(sighs)

08:54.658 --> 08:56.423
(microwave beeping)

08:59.633 --> 09:00.860
(door creaks)

09:00.897 --> 09:02.488
(door banging)

09:02.542 --> 09:03.808
Brandon!

09:03.928 --> 09:05.065
Brandon: What?

09:27.933 --> 09:30.197
(loud thud)

10:13.876 --> 10:15.001
(sighs)

10:35.809 --> 10:37.519
(lock turns)

10:42.118 --> 10:43.783
(door slams)

10:51.158 --> 10:53.073
So, it true that you, you know,

10:53.193 --> 10:55.447
cut class to have sex?

10:57.350 --> 10:58.469
Maybe.

10:58.588 --> 11:00.376
And why do you assume
that I'm not a virgin?

11:00.376 --> 11:02.390
- (coughs) Wyatt.
- Shut up!

11:02.413 --> 11:03.908
Okay, if you guys aren't gonna watch this,

11:03.934 --> 11:04.908
we can all just go up to bed.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.202
It's up to you.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.585
(clattering sounds)

11:15.967 --> 11:17.644
- (wind blowing)
- (sighs)

11:28.462 --> 11:29.884
(gasps)

11:31.206 --> 11:33.231
(metronome clicking)

12:13.138 --> 12:14.104
(gasps)

12:14.155 --> 12:15.255
Shh.

12:39.620 --> 12:40.937
Jack?

12:41.662 --> 12:43.116
I'm still in the system.

12:45.287 --> 12:46.658
Nobody wants me.

12:48.029 --> 12:49.255
Aren't you dead?

12:49.258 --> 12:50.996
(gasps)

13:00.794 --> 13:03.125
Have Moms said anything to you?

13:03.506 --> 13:04.735
No, you?

13:08.210 --> 13:10.091
I wish they'd just get this over with.

13:11.413 --> 13:12.597
And then what?

13:12.850 --> 13:15.193
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Yes, we did.

13:15.511 --> 13:17.774
We didn't tell them, we
didn't give them a chance.

13:18.653 --> 13:20.370
Chance to what?

13:20.836 --> 13:22.338
Not adopt me.

13:22.374 --> 13:24.616
- Callie, they wouldn't have...
- We don't know that.

13:24.639 --> 13:27.019
They still can. They
can reverse my adoption.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.562
I looked into it. They can do it.

13:28.618 --> 13:31.318
You have to stop thinking
that nobody wants you.

13:31.438 --> 13:33.316
- This is different.
- No, it's not.

13:33.368 --> 13:35.323
Callie, they're not gonna un-adopt you.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.030
They're not.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.057
Stef: What's going on?

13:43.552 --> 13:44.857
We were just talking.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.356
Callie, go back to your room now.

13:46.665 --> 13:48.148
(sighs)

13:57.290 --> 13:58.778
Are we gonna talk about this?

13:59.061 --> 14:01.130
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- No, no,

14:01.197 --> 14:03.671
- Cortney's moving tomorrow. I'm helping her.
- I don't care.

14:03.682 --> 14:05.654
- You are not helping her.
- She needs me.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.967
- She doesn't have anyone else.
- No one's leaving this house

14:08.000 --> 14:09.163
until Nick is found.

14:09.206 --> 14:10.606
You can't keep us locked up in here.

14:10.624 --> 14:13.080
You do not want to push
me on this, Brandon.

14:19.509 --> 14:22.096
Hey, what's... Hey, what's going on?

14:22.636 --> 14:24.585
I'm sorry, nothing. Nothing, honey, okay?

14:24.705 --> 14:25.890
Go back to bed.

14:35.279 --> 14:36.261
Okay?

14:37.926 --> 14:39.778
Did you ever dream about your dad,

14:40.736 --> 14:42.264
after he died?

14:42.945 --> 14:46.078
Yeah. I remember this one where, um...

14:46.664 --> 14:48.755
I was over at his house
sitting in his living room,

14:48.794 --> 14:50.304
we were watching a Padres game.

14:50.355 --> 14:53.652
And he asked me if I remembered
the first time I saw snow,

14:53.663 --> 14:56.572
which was at a Padres/Cubs game in Chicago

14:56.595 --> 14:58.211
he took me to when I was six.

14:59.327 --> 15:01.347
And I had said to him,

15:01.619 --> 15:04.158
"Why is there so much
dust in the sky, Daddy?"

15:08.363 --> 15:09.769
Yeah.

15:14.351 --> 15:16.318
I had a dream about Jack.

15:18.322 --> 15:20.049
He said that he was still in the system

15:20.082 --> 15:21.841
and that nobody wanted him.

15:26.298 --> 15:28.013
Do you ever think that dreams

15:28.051 --> 15:30.216
are a way they try to talk to us?

15:30.268 --> 15:32.049
(inhales deeply)

15:32.169 --> 15:34.076
No, no, I don't know what I think.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.721
You know, that day that we buried Frank,

15:36.760 --> 15:38.841
I went outside into the car and sat...

15:39.610 --> 15:43.224
sat in it to be alone and talk
to him and tell him I loved him

15:43.245 --> 15:45.048
and that I forgave him.

15:46.743 --> 15:49.101
And it started snow outside for real.

15:49.136 --> 15:50.721
San Diego, California.

15:52.663 --> 15:54.129
You think it was like a sign?

15:55.965 --> 15:57.475
I, uh...

15:57.741 --> 15:59.063
I like to think it was Frank

15:59.081 --> 16:01.847
telling me that he loved me
and forgave me, too, you know?

16:05.687 --> 16:08.974
I'm sorry you've had so
much loss in your young life.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.325
I really am.

16:14.457 --> 16:16.554
I love you, you know that.

16:17.115 --> 16:18.469
And I love you, too.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.297
Okay, get some sleep, baby.

16:38.003 --> 16:39.942
(scurrying sounds)

17:00.926 --> 17:01.980
Everything okay?

17:02.100 --> 17:04.414
Yeah, I think the rats
are up in the attic again.

17:04.425 --> 17:06.905
- Oh, great.
- I'll have to check the traps tomorrow.

17:06.939 --> 17:08.443
Come to bed.

17:11.443 --> 17:12.921
Is that really necessary?

17:13.750 --> 17:15.608
I certainly hope not.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.203
(clears throat)

17:18.226 --> 17:19.637
I, um...

17:21.298 --> 17:23.538
I found Callie in Brandon's room.

17:24.199 --> 17:25.382
Doing what?

17:25.501 --> 17:27.272
Talking, or so they say.

17:27.528 --> 17:29.692
- You think something else was going on?
- No.

17:30.154 --> 17:31.472
How are we ever going to be sure?

17:31.494 --> 17:32.866
You know, from now on,
every time they're alone,

17:32.890 --> 17:35.097
are we gonna wonder and worry?

17:36.111 --> 17:37.244
You think we're partly to blame

17:37.267 --> 17:38.944
for leaving them alone in Idyllwild?

17:38.947 --> 17:40.295
No, Mariana was with them,

17:40.320 --> 17:41.738
had no reason not to trust them.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.752
Sure as hell won't ever do that again.

17:45.124 --> 17:48.357
- Is that fair?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:48.579 --> 17:50.355
Honey, we're still a family.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.038
I mean, honestly, what...

17:52.445 --> 17:54.326
what are we gonna do? What can we do?

17:54.328 --> 17:57.246
Well, we can't pretend
like it didn't happen, yeah?

17:57.265 --> 17:58.525
Honey, it's not happening now.

17:58.531 --> 18:01.561
- Are you sure about that?
- I am, yes. I am.

18:04.894 --> 18:06.205
(sighs) Well...

18:08.878 --> 18:10.828
things are never gonna be the same.

18:10.949 --> 18:12.244
So it's different.

18:12.571 --> 18:15.234
We'll figure it out like
we do everything else.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.640
But none of the other kids need to know.

18:20.035 --> 18:22.561
In fact, I think it's
important that they don't ever.

18:22.682 --> 18:25.057
Well, I agree with you on that.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.381
Mariana: Are you awake?

18:38.323 --> 18:39.404
Yeah.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.203
Is it true?

19:05.099 --> 19:06.356
When?

19:07.845 --> 19:09.428
Up in Idyllwild.

19:10.644 --> 19:12.604
You and Brandon...

19:14.384 --> 19:15.641
Yeah.

19:27.665 --> 19:28.664
Anything?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.108
I've had a few calls from people who think

19:30.134 --> 19:31.962
that they've spotted Nick in Escondido.

19:31.970 --> 19:32.984
Oh, that's good.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.614
You think we maybe can relax a little now?

19:34.663 --> 19:36.894
Well, I think if he
hasn't shown up by now,

19:36.909 --> 19:37.907
he's not going to.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.152
- Especially in broad daylight.
- (safe beeps)

19:40.271 --> 19:41.359
But until they find him,

19:41.377 --> 19:43.577
I want to keep a car stationed out front.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.249
What are you doing?

19:48.368 --> 19:50.177
Uh, I'm gonna check the rat traps.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.258
You haven't heard them scratching
around up there again, have you?

19:52.288 --> 19:54.858
No. Hey, why does Brandon
get to leave the house?

19:54.859 --> 19:55.701
He doesn't.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.551
Well, the Mini's gone.
Does someone else have it?

19:57.846 --> 19:59.813
(sighs) The hell?

20:15.012 --> 20:16.577
- Hey, Momma?
- Yeah.

20:16.698 --> 20:18.818
Do you think we could find
out where Jack's buried?

20:19.471 --> 20:21.392
I'm sure we could.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.085
Do you want to visit his grave?

20:23.622 --> 20:24.770
I think so.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.113
I remember Mom saying something
about him having an aunt.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.252
- I can try to find her phone number.
- Thanks.

20:29.285 --> 20:30.789
So, apparently Brandon got up this morning

20:30.807 --> 20:33.786
to go help Cortney move after I
distinctly forbade him from doing so.

20:33.813 --> 20:35.596
Wait, forbade?

20:35.609 --> 20:36.633
What are you doing?

20:36.681 --> 20:38.948
I am texting him to get his ass back home.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.036
You took our phones.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.189
I'm just sayin'.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.449
Can I go to volleyball practice?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.781
It's at Mission Beach, so
it's nowhere near school.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.839
Yeah, just one of us is
gonna have to drive you.

20:55.871 --> 20:56.885
I can do it.

20:57.044 --> 20:57.921
Awesome.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.688
So we're safe now?

20:59.881 --> 21:01.757
We all just have to stay alert, please.

21:01.771 --> 21:03.025
No one goes out alone

21:03.041 --> 21:05.184
and make sure that the
doors are locked always.

21:05.713 --> 21:06.614
Jude: Okay, but...

21:06.733 --> 21:09.027
you know, when can we have
our phones and computers back?

21:10.630 --> 21:12.113
Soon, love. Soon.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.082
(gasps)

21:33.131 --> 21:35.451
Sorry, um, just grabbing my toothbrush.

21:35.477 --> 21:36.576
I can go downstairs.

21:36.695 --> 21:37.894
It's okay.

21:40.554 --> 21:42.949
So, you haven't said two
words to me since I told you.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.792
I mean, I don't really know what to say.

21:49.311 --> 21:52.099
Kind of makes me sick
to think you and Brandon

21:52.115 --> 21:53.910
in the cabin, when I was asleep.

21:54.766 --> 21:56.670
But I have no room to talk.

21:56.719 --> 21:59.723
I had sex on a beach with
Wyatt at a school party.

22:00.481 --> 22:02.669
At least you didn't cheat on anyone,

22:03.204 --> 22:04.792
except maybe the family in a way.

22:04.819 --> 22:06.329
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

22:06.775 --> 22:08.411
And it's totally over.

22:08.692 --> 22:11.282
- What did Moms say?
- Haven't yet.

22:12.847 --> 22:14.763
Well, at least we don't
have to keep anymore secrets.

22:14.816 --> 22:17.490
Some secrets should be kept.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.295
Justina can't get away
with what she's done.

22:22.321 --> 22:23.705
We have to fight back.

22:23.741 --> 22:25.115
How?

22:25.824 --> 22:27.626
There's got to be something.

22:29.884 --> 22:32.353
I, um... I took a picture of a check

22:32.472 --> 22:34.584
Arbiter made out to Justina.

22:34.635 --> 22:37.154
Well, that proves that she works for them.

22:37.558 --> 22:40.574
I mean, and it makes her
liable for Jack's death.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.671
I mean, at least ethically.
This could really hurt her.

22:43.704 --> 22:44.760
But how do we get it out there?

22:44.778 --> 22:46.863
It's not like we can just
post it on Fost and Found.

22:48.032 --> 22:49.602
Well, we can't, but...

22:50.726 --> 22:51.942
Justina can.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.294
(line ringing)

22:54.365 --> 22:55.323
Woman: Hello?

22:55.442 --> 22:57.759
Hi, is this Linda Dawson?

22:58.029 --> 22:59.157
Yes.

22:59.573 --> 23:02.544
Hi, my name is Lena Adams Foster, um,

23:02.663 --> 23:05.858
and my son, Jude, was friends
with your nephew, Jack.

23:08.049 --> 23:09.345
Hello?

23:09.770 --> 23:12.028
- I'm here.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

23:13.240 --> 23:14.955
anyway,

23:15.759 --> 23:19.369
my son would like to visit Jack's grave

23:19.642 --> 23:21.500
if... if you would be kind enough

23:21.517 --> 23:23.204
to tell us know where he's buried.

23:24.256 --> 23:25.666
(Linda sighs)

23:25.838 --> 23:28.549
Look, they called me to
say they cremated the body

23:28.588 --> 23:30.165
and I could pick up the ashes,

23:30.336 --> 23:32.025
but it would cost me $400

23:32.076 --> 23:34.425
and, well, I hardly knew the kid.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.469
I ain't seen him since he was a baby

23:37.501 --> 23:39.078
and I wasn't close to my sister.

23:39.134 --> 23:40.484
I just don't know.

23:40.605 --> 23:42.834
I don't got that kind of money right now.

23:42.953 --> 23:45.265
I don't know what they
done with him. I'm sorry.

23:45.529 --> 23:47.289
(dial tone)

23:53.932 --> 23:55.223
Honey?

24:00.536 --> 24:02.113
Honey, are you up there?

24:02.184 --> 24:03.496
- Yeah!
- Oh!

24:03.546 --> 24:05.371
Sorry, sorry.

24:05.490 --> 24:08.083
- Did you find anything?
- No.

24:09.765 --> 24:11.252
The rat traps are empty.

24:11.373 --> 24:12.586
There aren't any droppings.

24:12.608 --> 24:14.915
I mean, I guess it
could have been the wind.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.776
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.525
Do you know what the coroner does

24:18.583 --> 24:20.006
with remains that aren't claimed?

24:20.040 --> 24:22.659
Well, after a certain time, they bury 'em.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.479
Where?

24:23.491 --> 24:25.028
Uh, I don't know,

24:25.483 --> 24:26.926
a mass grave somewhere.

24:27.598 --> 24:28.405
Why?

24:28.605 --> 24:30.866
Well, I was talking to
Jude about, you know,

24:30.919 --> 24:32.585
trying to find some place where...

24:34.625 --> 24:36.378
And here I thought moving wasn't fun.

24:36.410 --> 24:37.617
(chuckling)

24:38.993 --> 24:40.663
Well, now that we don't
have to worry about

24:40.676 --> 24:42.340
Eddie walking in on us.

24:42.461 --> 24:45.055
Yeah, now all we have to
do is worry about Mason.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.167
I... I didn't mean that in a bad way.

24:49.326 --> 24:50.282
I know.

24:50.535 --> 24:51.642
He's a great kid.

24:52.372 --> 24:54.731
So what's, uh, going on with you?

24:55.635 --> 24:56.790
What do you mean?

24:57.459 --> 24:59.469
Well, when we were having sex,

24:59.500 --> 25:01.974
you seemed a little bit distracted.

25:04.028 --> 25:06.617
Oh, so you didn't, uh...

25:06.640 --> 25:07.821
Did you not...

25:08.789 --> 25:09.929
No, I did.

25:09.987 --> 25:14.005
You just, um, didn't
really seem as with me.

25:16.298 --> 25:17.498
I'm sorry.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.615
I... I just think that, um...

25:20.641 --> 25:21.866
Is it Nick?

25:23.446 --> 25:25.686
You must be worried
with him still out there.

25:26.779 --> 25:29.940
Oh, no, I mean, they
probably found him by now.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.878
That must've been scary,
the whole lockdown.

25:36.801 --> 25:37.983
Yeah.

25:55.739 --> 25:57.451
- There you are.
- (chuckles)

26:01.298 --> 26:02.498
Oh, my god.

26:06.708 --> 26:08.145
So where is everyone?

26:09.034 --> 26:11.324
Um, Lena and Jude went to

26:11.364 --> 26:14.643
drop Jesus at practice
and Stef's out somewhere.

26:14.718 --> 26:15.307
(line beeps)

26:15.355 --> 26:17.347
Hello, my name's Andrew.
How can I help you?

26:17.468 --> 26:19.941
Hi, my name's Justina Marks.

26:19.944 --> 26:23.030
I'm the chief admin
officer on Fost and Found,

26:23.421 --> 26:28.028
and I was hacked and I lost all
my info, including my passwords,

26:28.059 --> 26:29.919
so I can't get into my domain.

26:29.941 --> 26:31.171
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.223
Uh, I can send a link
to reset your password,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.090
I just need to ask you
a few security questions.

26:35.141 --> 26:35.875
Great.

26:36.288 --> 26:37.482
Mother's maiden name?

26:37.603 --> 26:38.711
Wimberley.

26:38.830 --> 26:39.859
Place of birth?

26:39.980 --> 26:41.130
Evanston, Illinois.

26:41.165 --> 26:42.780
- No.
- No?

26:43.516 --> 26:44.445
Um...

26:45.820 --> 26:47.127
Are you sure? I mean,

26:47.248 --> 26:48.503
that's where I was born.

26:48.548 --> 26:50.488
Oh, not you, your mother's place of birth.

26:50.537 --> 26:52.532
Oh, right, sorry.

26:52.573 --> 26:54.614
Uh, yeah, it's Piggot, Arkansas.

26:54.648 --> 26:57.442
Great. Last question, favorite pet's name?

26:59.040 --> 27:00.294
Um...

27:00.917 --> 27:03.250
uh, sorry, I have so many pets.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.544
Oh yeah, what do you have?

27:04.627 --> 27:07.354
Um, I have a cat

27:07.912 --> 27:09.143
and a dog,

27:09.461 --> 27:10.452
um...

27:11.250 --> 27:14.185
I have a bird, um, a fish.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.182
Uh-huh.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.147
Um, and a snake.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.401
- You have a snake?
- Yep.

27:20.905 --> 27:22.060
(phone chimes)

27:23.299 --> 27:24.184
Buttons.

27:24.229 --> 27:25.773
Sorry, not the snake.

27:25.782 --> 27:28.061
The schnoodle.

27:28.097 --> 27:30.425
Aww. What's your snake's name?

27:31.440 --> 27:32.683
Snakey.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.967
So cute.

27:34.050 --> 27:37.751
Okay, I'll send the link to
your email, Jmarks@JMI.vox.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.182
Actually, um, no,

27:40.224 --> 27:41.223
just 'cause I was hacked,

27:41.226 --> 27:43.988
could you send it to my assistant's email?

27:44.006 --> 27:48.122
It's JP123@mymail.vox.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.148
Okay, will do.

27:49.362 --> 27:51.278
- Great, thank you so much.
- Uh-huh.

27:53.204 --> 27:54.677
Snakey the snake?

27:55.089 --> 27:56.780
I don't know what you name a snake, okay?

27:57.419 --> 27:59.888
You are pretty adorable
when you're under pressure.

28:00.009 --> 28:02.864
Okay, try to control
yourselves until I do this,

28:03.270 --> 28:04.771
then I'll leave you alone.

28:04.803 --> 28:06.250
What exactly are you doing,

28:06.701 --> 28:07.878
and am I gonna get arrested

28:07.892 --> 28:09.445
for letting you hack
somebody on my computer?

28:09.459 --> 28:10.787
We're not hacking anyone.

28:10.788 --> 28:13.079
We're simply re-routing all of
the traffic from Fost and Found

28:13.092 --> 28:14.922
to a website called Justice4Jack.

28:15.325 --> 28:16.834
I made up the name.

28:16.993 --> 28:19.028
Of course, it's not as
good as Snakey the snake.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.717
And what's on Justice4Jack?

28:20.907 --> 28:24.432
A copy of the check that
Arbiter wrote to Justina.

28:25.353 --> 28:27.884
You know, the for-profit organization that

28:27.929 --> 28:30.097
had Jack placed with
Pearson and got him killed.

28:30.097 --> 28:31.421
Uh-huh.

28:31.674 --> 28:33.056
And how'd you get this check?

28:33.929 --> 28:35.516
I would rather not say.

28:35.556 --> 28:37.336
What if they trace this back to you guys?

28:37.849 --> 28:40.013
They won't. I'm using an anonymizer.

28:40.275 --> 28:41.376
And we're gonna send the link

28:41.425 --> 28:44.484
to every lawmaker in San
Diego County and Sacramento

28:44.528 --> 28:46.848
- to kill Justina's bill.
- All right.

28:47.313 --> 28:49.209
All I have to do is press "Return".

28:49.460 --> 28:50.644
Do it.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.423
(computer beeps)

28:53.542 --> 28:55.558
(both sigh)

28:55.979 --> 28:57.307
So now what?

28:57.634 --> 29:00.001
Now we wait and see.

29:01.972 --> 29:04.363
Well, I'm exhausted.

29:04.401 --> 29:07.215
- I'm gonna try to take a nap.
- Hey, thank you.

29:07.336 --> 29:08.978
No problem.

29:14.540 --> 29:16.483
(groans)

29:20.892 --> 29:22.336
How'd you find me?

29:22.377 --> 29:23.858
The address from your desk.

29:23.861 --> 29:25.601
I can't believe you
went through my things.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.619
I can't believe that you
blatantly disobeyed me.

29:27.636 --> 29:29.878
Disobeyed? I'm not a kid anymore.

29:29.950 --> 29:31.605
18 does not make you an adult, Brandon.

29:31.637 --> 29:32.835
I can vote.

29:33.551 --> 29:35.311
Any idiot can vote.

29:35.756 --> 29:38.282
And as long as you are
eating my food under my roof,

29:38.333 --> 29:40.873
- you will obey my rules.
- She wasn't adopted yet.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.240
- Okay, I'm gonna not talking about this here.
- No, Mom, I'm sorry.

29:44.359 --> 29:45.681
We made a mistake.

29:46.029 --> 29:48.875
But we are not real brother and sister.

29:48.902 --> 29:50.391
Oh, well, what about Jesus and Mariana?

29:50.423 --> 29:51.663
Are they not your real brother and sister?

29:51.672 --> 29:52.930
No, no, that's different.
We grew up together.

29:52.970 --> 29:54.806
Callie's only been living
with us for like a year.

29:54.815 --> 29:56.195
Okay, I'm not gonna listen to this, B.

29:56.227 --> 29:57.910
- Right, 'cause you never listen.
- Okay.

29:57.967 --> 30:00.623
Just like when I try to tell you
that I was in love with Callie,

30:00.647 --> 30:01.734
you took out a restraining order.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.801
Yes, which you apparently
violated several times.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.878
- Did you not?
- This is why we don't tell you anything,

30:06.127 --> 30:08.003
because we knew you
would never understand.

30:08.124 --> 30:10.205
What's to understand, Brandon?

30:10.326 --> 30:12.540
That you had sex with your foster sister?

30:12.568 --> 30:14.394
Doesn't matter that
she wasn't adopted yet.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.340
It was wrong.

30:15.461 --> 30:17.255
That's why you didn't come
to us, because it was wrong.

30:17.294 --> 30:18.842
You knew it and you were scared.

30:18.864 --> 30:20.224
- Yeah, we were scared.
- Yeah.

30:20.269 --> 30:23.102
- We were scared to hurt the family.
- Oh, come on.

30:23.136 --> 30:25.950
We gave up everything we felt
for each other to protect you.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.618
You deceived us. You deceived us, Brandon.

30:28.673 --> 30:30.258
There is no excuse for that.

30:30.377 --> 30:31.786
And I hold you mostly responsible

30:31.807 --> 30:34.339
because Callie was vulnerable
and you, of all people,

30:34.356 --> 30:37.039
should have known better. Now,
go get the rest of your stuff

30:37.075 --> 30:39.452
-  and get home, please.
- (scoffs)

30:41.307 --> 30:43.601
You know, okay.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.605
I take full responsibility.

30:47.176 --> 30:48.988
For everything.

30:49.814 --> 30:51.431
But I'm not coming home.

30:52.816 --> 30:54.171
Okay.

30:54.844 --> 30:57.232
Well, that's great. Then
what are you gonna do, B?

30:57.313 --> 30:58.760
Are you gonna go live with your dad again?

30:58.788 --> 31:01.810
- That went really well the first time.
- No, Mom, I'm gonna live here

31:02.133 --> 31:03.278
with Cortney.

31:06.780 --> 31:08.644
You might not think I'm an adult yet,

31:08.648 --> 31:10.520
but legally, I can live wherever I want.

31:17.657 --> 31:19.040
Okay.

31:21.376 --> 31:23.146
Well, good luck with that.

31:39.232 --> 31:40.362
Shh-shh.

31:40.893 --> 31:42.304
Don't scream, don't scream.

31:42.314 --> 31:44.201
Don't scream. Okay? Just don't be scared.

31:44.233 --> 31:46.248
Don't be scared. I just wanna talk to you.

31:46.413 --> 31:48.844
I've been waiting to talk to you,

31:48.963 --> 31:50.905
so, uh, just, um...

31:50.941 --> 31:52.772
Shh.

31:55.689 --> 31:56.645
Lena: Hey.

31:57.526 --> 31:59.732
AJ, is Mike here?

31:59.853 --> 32:01.670
Uh, no.

32:02.059 --> 32:03.623
Uh, I just... I borrowed his car.

32:03.932 --> 32:05.713
And I should be going

32:05.752 --> 32:08.645
because he actually has
to get to work tonight.

32:08.811 --> 32:10.781
So I'll talk to you later?

32:12.502 --> 32:14.487
I hope you weren't on Fost and Found.

32:14.521 --> 32:15.855
Why?

32:16.751 --> 32:19.590
Because we took your
computers away for a reason.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.684
What's in there?

32:25.066 --> 32:26.365
Jack's ashes.

32:27.906 --> 32:31.636
I need you to understand why.

32:31.757 --> 32:34.592
Okay? Why... why I can't,
um... why I can't because...

32:34.618 --> 32:36.876
there's too many voices in my head.

32:36.903 --> 32:40.988
I can't, uh, think straight
because they won't stop talking.

32:41.026 --> 32:42.759
And I hate it, and I hate everything.

32:42.769 --> 32:45.200
I hate myself, and I... I hate you.

32:45.453 --> 32:48.923
You know? I hate you.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.045
What are you going to do with them?

32:54.151 --> 32:56.194
I... I don't know.

32:56.230 --> 32:59.855
Do you think we could bury
them under Frankie's tree?

33:00.167 --> 33:03.601
- Jude...
- Oh, no, that's okay.

33:03.673 --> 33:06.557
Um, I think that would
be a lovely idea, honey.

33:07.498 --> 33:08.886
(door opens)

33:09.007 --> 33:10.092
(footsteps approaching)

33:10.303 --> 33:11.460
Hey, where have you been?

33:11.464 --> 33:14.262
Uh, do you think you guys could
give us a minute alone, please?

33:14.762 --> 33:16.074
- Sure.
- Okay.

33:18.086 --> 33:19.288
(sighs)

33:19.980 --> 33:21.170
What's the matter?

33:21.221 --> 33:22.508
Apparently, Brandon has decided

33:22.525 --> 33:24.356
that he's moving in with Cortney.

33:25.784 --> 33:27.058
Did you go over there?

33:28.496 --> 33:29.785
Stef?

33:29.955 --> 33:34.046
I need to do something
to make the hurt go away.

33:35.298 --> 33:38.338
You know, I can still hear
the snap of his belt. Snap.

33:38.361 --> 33:40.895
I would beg him not to hit me,

33:40.917 --> 33:42.567
and you know what he would say?

33:42.633 --> 33:44.597
He would say, "This is gonna hurt me

33:44.625 --> 33:47.104
a lot more than it's gonna hurt you."

33:47.132 --> 33:49.688
I mean, what?

33:52.086 --> 33:53.964
He humiliated me...

33:55.730 --> 33:57.373
like you did.

34:00.183 --> 34:02.294
Please, don't hurt me.

34:04.298 --> 34:06.104
I'm not gonna hurt you.

34:10.405 --> 34:11.777
No, Nick, don't.

34:12.369 --> 34:13.791
Were you scared

34:14.985 --> 34:16.224
during the lockdown?

34:16.844 --> 34:18.344
Yeah.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.525
Were you?

34:23.251 --> 34:24.690
I texted Connor.

34:26.577 --> 34:28.204
I mean, that's okay.

34:29.045 --> 34:30.501
I miss him.

34:32.659 --> 34:33.927
I know.

34:35.295 --> 34:37.108
I miss Jack, too.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.931
Why do bad things keep happening?

34:42.170 --> 34:45.469
Nick, don't. Please, don't hurt yourself.

34:45.496 --> 34:47.045
Why? Why, huh?

34:47.056 --> 34:49.503
- I'm all alone, I have no one.
- You have me.

34:49.518 --> 34:51.190
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

34:51.217 --> 34:52.784
You have me.

34:53.143 --> 34:54.693
No, I can't. I can't.

34:55.224 --> 34:56.846
Yes, you can. You can.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.152
You just have to put the gun down.

34:58.206 --> 34:59.170
What did you expect?

34:59.237 --> 35:01.161
You practically dragged him
out of his girlfriend's bed.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.057
- He was embarrassed.
- He should have been.

35:03.074 --> 35:05.324
- (knock on door)
- I hope it's Brandon.

35:05.351 --> 35:06.762
He has a key.

35:10.675 --> 35:11.887
Hey, look, look, look,

35:12.358 --> 35:13.713
I'm still wearing your necklace.

35:13.719 --> 35:16.204
Why I be wearing it if I
didn't want to be with you?

35:16.608 --> 35:19.054
What about Mat, huh? You don't love him?

35:19.684 --> 35:21.474
No, I... I don't.

35:21.797 --> 35:22.992
I love you.

35:27.994 --> 35:29.273
- Hey
- Hi, Stef.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.695
Is Mariana home?

35:31.077 --> 35:33.074
Uh, yeah, she is.

35:33.108 --> 35:34.934
I just want to check in after yesterday,

35:35.182 --> 35:36.405
see if she's okay.

35:37.019 --> 35:40.259
Um, sure. She's, uh...
she's upstairs in her room.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.911
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

35:52.085 --> 35:54.161
At least he's not in the system anymore.

36:00.119 --> 36:01.967
I'm sorry about what I said,

36:03.211 --> 36:04.972
that you lie about a lot of things.

36:05.092 --> 36:06.523
I know it's not true.

36:09.594 --> 36:11.025
No, it's okay.

36:23.592 --> 36:26.679
(Nick sobbing)

36:27.260 --> 36:28.411
Mariana: It's not too late.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.161
Okay? I promise, we can still be together.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.349
Please, don't hurt yourself.

36:33.469 --> 36:37.884
(whispers) Mat, don't go in
there. Go get Stef. Go get Stef.

36:39.824 --> 36:41.507
Well, I burned down the warehouse,

36:41.527 --> 36:43.798
so, they're gonna send me to jail anyway.

36:44.563 --> 36:46.764
Your dad wouldn't let that happen.

36:46.798 --> 36:48.092
He doesn't care about me!

36:48.121 --> 36:50.007
He doesn't... he doesn't care about me.

36:50.277 --> 36:52.878
Okay? I... I can't...

36:52.998 --> 36:54.737
I need it to stop.

36:54.909 --> 36:57.958
It will stop if we're together.

36:57.985 --> 37:00.061
But we can't be together
if you hurt yourself.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.639
So please...

37:04.034 --> 37:05.750
don't leave me alone.

37:07.128 --> 37:08.637
Don't break my heart.

37:08.757 --> 37:10.704
(breathing heavily)

37:12.128 --> 37:13.673
I need you.

37:15.918 --> 37:18.896
Please, just... just...
just come sit with me.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.211
(whispers) Nick's in there.

37:23.559 --> 37:24.887
Go in there.

37:34.268 --> 37:36.614
(Nick sobbing)

37:41.963 --> 37:43.226
(whispers) Mariana.

38:00.186 --> 38:02.371
Stef: Okay, it's okay
now, Nick, it's all over.

38:02.490 --> 38:04.641
Mariana, come with me. No, no, no, let

38:04.668 --> 38:07.090
her come with me and you're gonna be fine.

38:07.512 --> 38:10.077
Just let her come with
me. It's gonna be all over.

38:10.682 --> 38:12.568
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

38:12.601 --> 38:13.742
Go find Momma. Go.

38:13.775 --> 38:15.523
- Okay.
- You go find Momma.

38:17.311 --> 38:18.688
Gonna be okay now, Nick.

38:18.722 --> 38:22.507
It's all over, okay? It's all over.

38:23.208 --> 38:30.920
â™ª Say I'm okay in my ear â™ª

38:36.760 --> 38:38.731
â™ª Say â™ª

38:38.851 --> 38:41.012
- â™ª I'm afraid â™ª
- Nick!

38:42.465 --> 38:44.898
â™ª In the New Year â™ª

38:51.081 --> 38:56.409
â™ª Raise the white flag â™ª

38:56.922 --> 39:01.981
â™ª And never cross paths â™ª

39:04.996 --> 39:09.789
â™ª Once you go back â™ª

39:10.197 --> 39:14.844
â™ª You never go back â™ª

39:15.139 --> 39:16.590
Hey.

39:17.668 --> 39:19.333
Are you okay?

39:22.251 --> 39:23.889
I thought he was gonna shoot me.

39:24.231 --> 39:25.969
And then he put the gun to his head.

39:28.411 --> 39:30.500
I'm so sorry.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.608
What... what if he shot himself, like,

39:37.045 --> 39:38.577
right here my room?

39:41.356 --> 39:42.994
I mean, how did you...

39:43.840 --> 39:46.413
What did you say to him?

39:48.277 --> 39:50.418
I... I don't know. I...

39:51.072 --> 39:53.007
I just kept talking.

39:54.836 --> 39:57.202
And then he cried in my arms.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.152
He's so sad.

40:02.181 --> 40:03.400
Come here.

40:05.856 --> 40:08.539
- â™ª In the New Year â™ª
- You're okay.

40:10.226 --> 40:12.041
(whispers) It's okay.

40:14.722 --> 40:19.708
â™ª Raise the white flag â™ª

40:20.161 --> 40:24.353
â™ª And never cross paths â™ª

40:24.474 --> 40:26.505
I want to get an alarm.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.038
I want to get bars on the windows.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.574
Whatever it takes to make us safe.

40:30.693 --> 40:32.807
Honey, we are fine. Okay? We're fine.

40:34.384 --> 40:38.762
â™ª You never go back â™ª

40:39.717 --> 40:41.554
What are we gonna to do about Callie?

40:42.768 --> 40:46.224
â™ª Sit at home, sit in here â™ª

40:46.344 --> 40:50.527
â™ª Sit at home, sit in here â™ª

40:52.744 --> 40:54.239
Now you have a home.

40:56.235 --> 41:00.103
â™ª Sit at home, sit in here â™ª
