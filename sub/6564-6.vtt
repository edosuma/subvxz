00:09.930 --> 00:13.010
Well! It took forever to be finally full.

00:13.050 --> 00:14.580
What do you guys think? Pretty nice, huh?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.050
Yeah, it's a giant tank of awesome!

00:17.800 --> 00:20.680
Yeah, but I had to pee three
times watching you fill it.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.780
Oh, great, four.
Wait. False alarm.

00:26.030 --> 00:27.620
You know, I'm a little torn.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.860
It's beautiful to look at,

00:29.890 --> 00:31.020
but I just can't get over the fact

00:31.060 --> 00:33.630
that they're swimming around
in their own bathroom.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.700
So were you in Nana's pool last summer.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.670
So, where'd you get it?

00:41.700 --> 00:44.040
I got it from Jimmy One Eye.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.610
It was either that or his massage chair.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.740
And I happen to know that he's
used that one in the buff.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.710
Solid choice on the fish tank.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.650
Be right back, Uncle Frank.
I'm gonna go deliver to Vainglorious.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.710
All right.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.720
Wait. Vainglorious?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.690
Theodore Vainglorious?

01:00.720 --> 01:01.790
Yeah, why?

01:01.820 --> 01:04.620
He's the hottest choreographer of the 9os,

01:04.660 --> 01:06.630
who began his career as a
young dancer on Broadway

01:06.660 --> 01:08.790
in the short-lived adaptation
of <i>Jaws: The Musical.</i>

01:08.830 --> 01:11.500
One night he met Madonna and
she said, "I love your moves,"

01:11.530 --> 01:13.630
and the next thing you know,
she was doing his moves

01:13.670 --> 01:15.570
and he went on to choreograph every
major music video of the decade.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.800
How do you know all that?

01:18.840 --> 01:22.710
Well, remember that one time I
got an A on a research report?

01:22.740 --> 01:24.540
Oh, right, "Theodore Vainglorious:

01:24.580 --> 01:26.750
"An Exploration of Modern
and Supercool Dance."

01:27.580 --> 01:28.810
Yeah. My mom
had it framed.

01:28.850 --> 01:33.750
It's on the wall right next to
all my participant ribbons.

01:33.790 --> 01:36.520
I still have no idea
why he's such a big deal.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.590
Because he's the guy who came up with this.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.630
The Double Pegasus!
I know that move.

01:44.660 --> 01:45.660
See?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.540
Wow!

01:49.570 --> 01:52.640
Deuce, we are delivering this pizza.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.710
What?
Uh, excuse me,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.640
we're not just gonna show up at
Theodore's apartment with a pizza.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.580
We're not?
No.

01:59.610 --> 02:00.550
Not until we figure out what dance
moves we're gonna show him.

02:03.580 --> 02:04.650
Ooh, guys, check it out.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.520
A triggerfish, a clown
fish, African cichlids,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.560
oh, gouramis, oh, and gobies!

02:12.730 --> 02:14.790
What?

02:14.830 --> 02:16.800
You think you're the only one who's
ever gotten an A on a research report?

We are about to meet
choreographers of our time.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.480
Plus, I've seen pictures. He was two ** back in the 9os.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.770
Yeah, but that was a long time ago.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.940
I bet now he's got
distinguished older guy vibe

03:29.970 --> 03:31.700
like Usher or Justin Timberlake.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.740
Come in!

03:40.810 --> 03:42.820
Are you sure this is the right place?

03:43.880 --> 03:45.790
Well, if not,

03:45.820 --> 03:48.050
I think we found Theodore's than we are.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.960
New delivery girls.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.900
Hey, what happened
to the kid with the eyebrow?

04:00.930 --> 04:02.970
Yeah, more important, what
happened to the guy on the horse?

04:05.740 --> 04:07.670
Um, are you the same Theodore Vainglorious

04:07.710 --> 04:08.940
who invented the Double Pegasus?

04:08.980 --> 04:12.810
Oh, oh, I understand the confusion.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.820
I've had my teeth whitened since
the portrait was commissioned.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.690
Right, I knew there
was something different.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
It's me.

04:27.730 --> 04:31.760
I got tired of my penthouse
overlooking the city.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.700
I'm really into the urban scene now.

04:35.740 --> 04:36.800
Drink in my view.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.040
Gorgeous!

04:40.740 --> 04:44.010
Now, run along, girls,

04:44.040 --> 04:45.950
Got a big show to get ready for.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.850
Oh, you're choreographing something new?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.850
No, I'm watching
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

04:49.880 --> 04:50.780
It's college week.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.660
Unbelievable.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.730
Unbelievable.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.760
Run out of your favorite
color of spray tan, Gary?

05:04.870 --> 05:06.700
No.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.770
My bosses want something
promotable on the show,

05:08.800 --> 05:09.970
something that'll grab viewers

05:10.000 --> 05:11.840
and slap the remote
right out of their hands,

05:11.870 --> 05:12.940
but I got nothing.

05:14.740 --> 05:15.840
Ooh! Ooh!
Wait a minute.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.610
We can get Theodore Vainglorious!

05:17.640 --> 05:18.880
You can?
We can?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.850
The Theodore Vainglorious?

05:22.880 --> 05:24.880
Theodore "Double Pegasus" Vainglorious?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.950
Theodore...

05:26.990 --> 05:30.660
Vainglorious?
You know him?

05:30.690 --> 05:32.990
Sure, the three of us are like this.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.930
I mean, this.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.770
Do it.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
I'm gonna call corporate
and take all the credit.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.870
I mean sing your praises.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.940
No, I mean take all the credit.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.710
Okay, one, what are you doing?

05:50.740 --> 05:53.680
And, two, what are you doing?

05:53.710 --> 05:55.780
Look, we are going to help
Theodore Vainglorious.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.020
Rocky, if we really wanted to help him,

05:58.050 --> 06:01.720
we'd get him a couch that's not held
together by duct tape and willpower.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.690
Come on, let's not get involved.

06:04.730 --> 06:07.690
CeCe, Theodore's fallen on some hard times.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.600
And I know he's not what he once was,

06:09.630 --> 06:12.700
but we could help pick him back up.

06:12.730 --> 06:16.700
Unfortunately, I'm a little busy
doing absolutely anything else.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.770
Come on.
CeCe, if I fell,

06:20.810 --> 06:22.780
wouldn't you be there to pick me back up?

06:22.810 --> 06:24.610
Wait.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.750
Don't answer that.

06:27.710 --> 06:29.650
I want to believe the answer is yes.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.790
Deuce!

06:39.830 --> 06:41.830
I got something for ya.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.730
Let me guess, another insult?

06:43.760 --> 06:44.630
What are you gonna make fun of now?

06:44.670 --> 06:47.670
My hair? My hygiene?

06:47.700 --> 06:50.800
Or you're gonna go with a
classic, like my eyebrows.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.810
You are so sensitive, you furry,
stinky, caterpillar-eyed guy.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.740
No, I need someone to hold the
key to the cash register.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.950
Me?
Yeah.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.680
You trust me the most?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.750
No, you're just the first one I saw.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.720
Ah.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.750
Well, you can count on me, Uncle Frank.

07:08.790 --> 07:10.820
I swear I'll put that key in a place
where no one can ever find it.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.660
Oh, you're gonna put it
next to your deodorant?

07:14.930 --> 07:16.800
Hey, I do insult you a lot.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.770
Don't lose that key.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.970
Wow, that's a big responsibility.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.810
Are you sure you can handle it?

07:26.840 --> 07:29.680
Please. How hard is it
to hold onto a key?

07:29.710 --> 07:30.980
And where exactly is the key right now?

07:31.010 --> 07:32.980
It's right...

07:35.780 --> 07:36.750
I lost it!

07:37.650 --> 07:38.950
Not good.

07:38.990 --> 07:43.660
All bad. Life ruined.
Game over.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.930
Dude, he hasn't given it to you yet.

07:46.960 --> 07:47.860
I knew that.

07:53.930 --> 07:57.670
I'll have the rent check tomorrow, I swear!

07:57.700 --> 07:58.940
Uh, it's not your landlord.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.940
It's opportunity knocking.

08:00.970 --> 08:04.940
What are you girls doing here?
I didn't order a pizza.

08:04.980 --> 08:08.850
We want you to choreograph the next
episode of <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

08:08.880 --> 08:10.880
You mean the local teen TV dance show?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.620
Yeah!
No thanks.

08:12.650 --> 08:13.820
Wait, no, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

08:13.850 --> 08:17.790
Wait. This could be a very
great opportunity for you.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.930
But that's not where my head is at.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.900
I prefer the world of teaching now.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.970
You teach dance?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.900
I teach the senior citizens
aqua aerobics class at the Y.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.800
You're a little young,
but feel free to stop by.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.840
It's never too early to battle arthritis.

08:37.940 --> 08:39.710
You're a genius, and we
really, really need you.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.850
You have my attention.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.720
Go on.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.790
Well, we just think that this
would be a great opportunity

08:47.820 --> 08:50.920
to expose a whole new generation
to your amazing talent.

08:51.930 --> 08:52.760
Still listening.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.730
It pays 500 bucks.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.700
I am in!

09:04.600 --> 09:07.610
Lake Superior whitefish.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.710
Let's rock, ladies!

09:14.920 --> 09:17.720
So, there we were on top
of Madison Square Garden.

09:17.750 --> 09:21.720
Me, Madonna, a young Lady Gaga,

09:21.760 --> 09:23.660
who back then was called Baby Gaga,

09:25.630 --> 09:27.690
to those of us who really
knew her, Goo-Goo Gaga.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.700
Can I talk to you for a second?

09:32.730 --> 09:34.800
Dude, helping Theodore was a great idea.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.970
He's amazing!
Yes,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.740
but the show is in two days,

09:37.770 --> 09:38.770
and he hasn't shown us any moves.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.670
We've learned nothing.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.710
Um, excuse me, I believe we've learned

09:42.740 --> 09:43.740
that Madonna's not a morning person,

09:43.780 --> 09:45.950
and Usher was once an usher.

09:47.810 --> 09:50.620
So, we all jump out
and yell, "Surprise!"

09:50.650 --> 09:53.920
Michael was so shocked, one of
his sequined gloves fell off.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.690
I said, "Now, that is
an interesting look."

09:56.720 --> 09:57.820
And the rest is history.

10:00.830 --> 10:01.990
Great story, great story.

10:02.030 --> 10:05.000
Hey, how about we learn that dance?

10:05.030 --> 10:07.770
Okay. Uh, good idea.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.870
I guess it's time.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.840
Okay, kids, the maestro
will begin conducting.

10:14.010 --> 10:18.740
Okay, hands up, clap, turn,

10:18.780 --> 10:19.710
shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy,

10:19.750 --> 10:23.980
girls face forward, one step up,

10:24.020 --> 10:25.920
shake, shake, shake,

10:25.950 --> 10:29.790
guys turn back, hands up, clap,

10:29.820 --> 10:32.760
everybody jump to the right.

10:32.790 --> 10:34.060
Whoa, whoa!

10:35.860 --> 10:37.700
Interesting.

10:37.730 --> 10:38.860
Worked in the pool.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.940
Theodore, how do we put this gently...

10:46.770 --> 10:48.040
You don't seem to know
what the heck you're doing.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.680
I'm sorry?
Excuse me?

10:53.710 --> 10:56.680
Rocky, you know you can't
talk to him like that.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.820
He's Theodore "Double
Pegasus" Vainglorious.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.020
Born in Ohio to Marge and
Chester Vainglorious.

11:01.050 --> 11:05.690
My mother was in labor for two
days and I came out kicking!

11:07.890 --> 11:09.930
So, you're kind of late for everything.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.870
You really gotta start
teaching us that dance.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.640
You're absolutely right.

11:16.670 --> 11:17.700
But there's one
teeny-tiny problem.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.710
It's just a little hiccup.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.710
I'm a fraud!

11:22.740 --> 11:23.780
A fraud!

11:23.810 --> 11:25.780
I'm creatively bankrupt.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.680
I haven't come up with a
new move in 15 years.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.720
I even stole my water aerobics routine

11:32.750 --> 11:34.950
from another teacher at the Y.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.730
Now I'm wondering if he
really did know 50 Cent

11:40.760 --> 11:42.240
back when he was just a quarter.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.050
The show is in a couple of days

11:51.080 --> 11:53.750
and our choreographer is nothing
but tears and leg warmers.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.860
Come on, we've got to tell Gary.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.830
Oh, just give him a few minutes.
He'll pull it together.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.960
See? He's fine!

12:08.000 --> 12:10.640
All right, we'll tell Gary.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.670
Oh, good, 'cause here he is.

12:12.710 --> 12:13.740
What?
No, no, no, no!

12:13.770 --> 12:14.840
Gary!

12:14.870 --> 12:15.840
We need to talk to you about Theodore.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.810
I know what you're gonna say.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.980
I've already taken care of it.

12:19.010 --> 12:20.750
Oh, you did?
Yeah.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.880
It was wrong for taking all the
credit about bringing in Theodore,

12:23.920 --> 12:25.820
so I did the right thing.

12:25.850 --> 12:28.790
I told my bosses it was all
Rocky and CeCe's idea.

12:28.820 --> 12:29.720
What?

12:34.760 --> 12:35.760
Maybe you should call them back

12:35.800 --> 12:37.830
and tell them it wasn't all our idea.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.670
Not our idea.
No!

12:39.700 --> 12:41.870
Oh, yes it was.
It was all you, you, you!

12:41.900 --> 12:43.640
You thought of it, you got
him, you "rought him.

12:43.670 --> 12:45.000
But you approved it.
It was you!

12:45.040 --> 12:46.070
Yeah, you did!

12:46.110 --> 12:49.710
Stop being so modest!
And here's the best part.

12:49.740 --> 12:51.810
They're promoting
the heck out of this episode.

12:51.850 --> 12:53.910
Spending tons of money
on billboards and radio,

12:53.950 --> 12:55.850
and it is all because of the two of you!

12:57.000 --> 13:03.074

13:20.010 --> 13:20.710
What ya doing?

13:22.840 --> 13:25.810
What? Oh, nothing.

13:25.850 --> 13:27.880
Just... Just thought I'd
straighten up the trash can.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.620
So you're not looking for the key?

13:32.650 --> 13:35.920
"Looking for the key."
That's rich. Okay.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.990
So you know where the key is.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.930
Of course, okay?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.960
For your information, much like
America's nuclear arsenal,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I have devised a plan
where every 15 minutes,

13:45.030 --> 13:46.700
I move the key to a new,
safe, secret location

13:46.730 --> 13:48.970
where no one will ever find it.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.810
So this cash register key
is just a decoy key

13:54.840 --> 13:58.940
that you made to look like the real key?

13:58.980 --> 14:01.850
If that'll make me look less
stupid, then yes. Yes, it is.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.780
You know what, dude?
Just let me hold it.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.950
It's my responsibility.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.720
I can handle it. Okay?

14:13.690 --> 14:14.730
Nicely handled.

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
Oh, no!

14:17.860 --> 14:23.770
Key in the tank!
Key in the tank!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.700
Hey, at least one of
the fish didn't eat it.

14:26.710 --> 14:27.810
Oh, wait...

14:27.840 --> 14:28.870
Spoke too soon.

14:34.910 --> 14:37.920
So annoying!

14:37.950 --> 14:41.820
How long does it take
to build a 20-story building?

14:41.860 --> 14:43.890
I'm guessing longer than two hours, CeCe.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.760
Okay, so what do we do now?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.700
The show is tomorrow
and we have no choreographer.

14:51.730 --> 14:55.000
Wait, this is your area of expertise.

14:55.030 --> 14:57.700
What do you do when you
have a test the next day,

14:57.740 --> 14:58.040
but you haven't studied at all?

14:58.070 --> 14:59.910
I fail.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.610
You know what? We're just gonna
have to call Gary and tell him.

15:05.650 --> 15:06.850
I give up.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.820
Really, Rocky?

15:09.850 --> 15:12.820
You're just going to give up 'cause
there's a little obstacle in the way?

15:12.850 --> 15:14.690
"Ooh, there's a tree in the road.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.950
"I better turn around and go back home.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.960
"I'll discover America
another time."

15:22.800 --> 15:24.930
What are you talking about?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.770
Columbus came here on a boat.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.870
Yes. Because
he didn't give up.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.940
Look, we're dancers.
Why can't we just choreograph it?

15:36.980 --> 15:39.850
Wait, that's actually a great idea.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.910
Okay, let's come up with a dance.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.560
But who can concentrate
with all that noise?

15:54.590 --> 15:57.560
I know!

15:57.600 --> 15:58.830
Those stupid construction
workers with their little

15:58.870 --> 16:01.930
and their bang! Bang!

16:01.970 --> 16:05.500
Oh, I wish they would go build
a building somewhere else.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.770
No, it's a good thing.

16:07.810 --> 16:10.880
Yes, I know, it stimulates the
economy and creates jobs.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.520
One, I am very impressed that
that just came out of your mouth.

16:16.550 --> 16:17.620
And, two, no.

16:19.850 --> 16:23.560
Do you remember your paper?

16:23.590 --> 16:26.660
It said that Theodore got his
inspiration from everyday things

16:26.690 --> 16:27.890
that occurred around him.

16:27.930 --> 16:31.800
So, do that, uh, jackhammer thing again.

16:31.830 --> 16:33.770
Okay.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.670
Boom! Boom!

16:36.700 --> 16:38.670
Boom!

16:38.710 --> 16:41.670
Boom! Boom! Boom!

16:41.710 --> 16:42.770
I got it, I got it!
You got it?

16:42.810 --> 16:44.710
Okay, ready?

16:44.740 --> 16:47.850
Boom! Boom! Boom!

16:47.880 --> 16:51.720
Boom! Boom! Boom!

16:51.750 --> 16:52.580
Boom!

17:16.540 --> 17:18.609
Did you find the key yet?

17:21.810 --> 17:22.710
Yeah. I found it
10 minutes ago.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.849
Now I'm just looking for buried treasure.

17:25.650 --> 17:27.589
Well, if you're gonna be like that,

17:27.619 --> 17:29.590
I'm not gonna help you at all.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.790
You're not helping at all!

17:30.890 --> 17:33.830
Beg to differ.

17:33.860 --> 17:36.530
If it wasn't for me, the key
wouldn't even be in there.

17:37.830 --> 17:38.860
Deuce!

17:41.800 --> 17:45.540
Hey, Uncle Frank.
What're you doing here?

17:45.570 --> 17:47.770
Thought I'd stop by and check out
how your restaurant's doing.

17:47.810 --> 17:49.540
Oh, wait, it's mine.

17:49.740 --> 17:51.880
That's a good one, Uncle Frank.

17:51.910 --> 17:53.650
You should write that one down.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.680
In your office.
At home.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.620
Hey, have you seen, uh, Deuce?

17:59.650 --> 18:01.750
Uh, he's floating around here somewhere.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.560
Hey, have you checked out
the eel in the fish tank?

18:06.590 --> 18:08.730
Eel? What eel?

18:08.760 --> 18:12.730
Apparently there's this rare
electric Mexican eel in there.

18:12.770 --> 18:14.630
How do you think Jimmy
One Eye got his name?

18:20.510 --> 18:22.510
Quick, get out!
There's an electric eel in there!

18:23.610 --> 18:25.810
Eel? Help me! Help me!

18:25.850 --> 18:29.820
Wait, wait.
There's no eel, you big galoot.

18:29.850 --> 18:32.820
Wait, if you knew he was in there,
why didn't you say anything?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.650
Well, I would've.

18:34.690 --> 18:35.550
I was just so thrilled
that he finally took a bath.

18:37.860 --> 18:39.790
Now get out of there.
I need that key I gave you.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.630
Key? Uh-oh.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.840
I'd like to thank you girls
for dragging me down here

18:51.870 --> 18:56.580
so I can witness my failure firsthand.

18:56.610 --> 18:58.640
Perhaps later on, you can
give me a paper cut,

18:58.680 --> 18:59.810
we'll pour lemon juice on it!

19:00.810 --> 19:03.720
Um, actually, I think
you'll be pretty happy

19:03.750 --> 19:04.780
with how your dance turned out.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.520
What do you mean?

19:06.550 --> 19:07.550
Just watch.

19:08.590 --> 19:09.720
Welcome back, Chicago.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.490
You've heard about it all week,

19:11.520 --> 19:12.460
now get ready to scrape the skies

19:12.490 --> 19:14.530
