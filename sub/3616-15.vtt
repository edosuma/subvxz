03:25.120 --> 03:26.646

SO THAT WHEN SHE DOES
DISCOVER THE TRUTH,

03:31.829 --> 03:34.022
SHE WILL BEND
TO YOUR WILL.

12:02.248 --> 12:03.190
COLE, WE HAVE TO, UH...

12:03.290 --> 12:05.023
OH, UH, THIS IS MIKE,
MY LAW CLERK.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.401
HE WAS JUST LEAVING.
THANKS.

12:08.501 --> 12:10.899
YOU CAN, UH, CATCH ME UP
ON THOSE CASES TOMORROW.

12:10.999 --> 12:13.900
RIGHT.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.169
SURE.

12:15.711 --> 12:16.419
EXCUSE ME.

12:20.796 --> 12:24.197
<i>COLE, THIS IS KAREN YOUNG.</i>

12:24.297 --> 12:26.072
<i>PLEASED TO MEET YOU.</i>

12:26.172 --> 12:27.173
<i>SHE UHH... SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.</i>

12:36.218 --> 12:39.661
I WAS GOING IN EARLY.

12:39.761 --> 12:40.909
IT WAS STILL DARK.

12:41.009 --> 12:42.910
I SAID GOOD-BYE
TO MY HUSBAND.

12:43.010 --> 12:46.496
AND THEN
I DON'T REMEMBER.

12:46.596 --> 12:47.913
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

12:48.013 --> 12:50.913
KAREN, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU.

12:51.013 --> 12:54.014
I PROMISE.

12:57.308 --> 13:00.793
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

13:00.893 --> 13:01.916
I DON'T KNOW.

13:02.016 --> 13:03.555
I HAD A PREMONITION
THAT SHE WAS BEING
ATTACKED BY DEMONS,

13:03.565 --> 13:05.918
ONLY I DON'T THINK
IT WAS A PREMONITION,

13:06.018 --> 13:07.586
I THINK
IT ALREADY HAPPENED.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.254
BUT SHE WAS HIT
BY SOME KIND OF LIGHT BALL.

13:09.354 --> 13:13.255
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO POSTPONE
THIS EVENING, BABY.

13:13.355 --> 13:16.589
NO, WE CAN'T!

13:16.689 --> 13:19.022
WELL...COLE,
INNOCENTS COME FIRST.

13:20.106 --> 13:23.466
OF COURSE THEY DO.

13:23.566 --> 13:25.592
I JUST--

13:25.692 --> 13:27.401
I JUST CAN'T WAIT
TO BE ALONE WITH YOU.

13:28.652 --> 13:31.194
I'LL DO WHATEVER
I CAN TO HELP. AHEM.

13:39.279 --> 13:42.615
FORGIVE ME?

13:52.451 --> 13:55.644
MMM.
MMM.

13:55.744 --> 13:58.662
YUMMY?

14:03.329 --> 14:06.938
UH...HI.
HI, HI, HI, HI.

14:07.038 --> 14:10.232
INNOCENT AFOOT, REMEMBER?

14:10.332 --> 14:12.940
RIGHT.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.024
[CHUCKLES]

14:14.124 --> 14:15.442
SO, SHE'S CALMER NOW,

14:15.542 --> 14:17.526
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
HANG OUT WITH HER

14:17.626 --> 14:19.110
WHILE WE GO
CHECK THE BOOK?

14:19.210 --> 14:20.961
ABSOLUTELY.
AHEM.

14:23.086 --> 14:24.043
UH...PIPER!

14:26.420 --> 14:28.071
WHAT?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.838
UH, NOTHING. IT'S OK.

14:31.046 --> 14:34.282
[Piper] HMM.

14:34.382 --> 14:36.947
SUDDENLY I CAN'T WAIT
TO GO ON MY HONEYMOON.

14:37.047 --> 14:38.949
ME, EITHER.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.384
[Phoebe] MUST BE
THE FULL MOON.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.218
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.161
I DON'T KNOW.

14:48.261 --> 14:50.971
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

14:51.136 --> 14:52.429
WHO ATTACKED YOU?

14:54.638 --> 14:56.205
DON'T TOUCH ME!

14:56.305 --> 14:57.997
DON'T TOUCH ME!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

14:58.097 --> 14:59.848
HE WAS TOUCHING ME.

15:09.726 --> 15:13.143
I DIDN'T HEAR
YOU COME IN.

15:16.060 --> 15:19.254
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:19.354 --> 15:20.438
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU SAW A GHOST.

15:20.730 --> 15:22.188
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I SAW.

15:24.106 --> 15:26.883
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:26.983 --> 15:28.190
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING TO HER?

15:30.065 --> 15:31.233
I WAS COMFORTING HER.

15:33.568 --> 15:35.067
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
SHE'S HYSTERICAL.

15:36.318 --> 15:37.902
GOT IT!

15:39.570 --> 15:40.968
THAT WAS QUICK.

15:41.069 --> 15:42.304
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE THAT GOOD.

15:42.404 --> 15:43.637
THANKS FOR COMING.

15:43.737 --> 15:45.970
UH, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.197
YEAH?

15:48.031 --> 15:48.864
I MEAN, WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM WITH HER?

15:53.115 --> 15:55.073
[Paige] POWER-BROKERS?

15:56.659 --> 15:58.058
OF COURSE.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.975
APPARENTLY,
THE LIGHT BALL

16:00.075 --> 16:01.351
THAT WAS THROWN
AT KAREN WAS
A DEMONIC POWER.

16:01.451 --> 16:03.976
[Cole] YEAH, BROKERS'LL
SOMETIMES USE PEOPLE

16:04.076 --> 16:06.145
TO STORE POWERS
UNTIL THEY FIND A BUYER.

16:06.245 --> 16:08.978
THAT WAY,
THIEVES CAN'T GET TO THEM.

16:09.078 --> 16:11.078
"A HUMAN BEING
POSSESSED OF A DEMONIC POWER

16:12.998 --> 16:14.980
"WILL BECOME CONFUSED,

16:15.080 --> 16:16.148
"THEN FRIGHTENED,
PARANOID, VIOLENT

16:16.248 --> 16:17.816
"AND DEMONIC
AND WILL ULTIMATELY

16:17.916 --> 16:19.149
DIE IF THE POWER
ISN'T WITHDRAWN."

16:19.249 --> 16:22.775
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THERE IS A POTION

16:22.875 --> 16:24.776
TO PULL THE POWER
OUT OF HER.

16:24.876 --> 16:25.818
[PAGER BEEPS]

16:25.918 --> 16:27.127
OH.

16:28.294 --> 16:28.752
THAT'S WORK.

16:31.628 --> 16:33.154
THEY PROBABLY WANT ME
TO FILL OUT MORE FORMS.

16:33.254 --> 16:34.986
OK, BABY,
WELL, YOU GO,
AND WE'LL CALL YOU

16:35.086 --> 16:37.155
IF WE NEED YOU.

16:37.255 --> 16:38.505
[Phoebe] MMM.

16:42.549 --> 16:45.991
[Karen] I GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE!

16:46.091 --> 16:47.533
I HAVE A FAMILY
TO TAKE CARE OF.

16:47.633 --> 16:48.991
KAREN,
YOUR FAMILY IS OK.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.367
BUT I HAVE A JOB!
I HAVE A DEADLINE!

16:50.467 --> 16:52.992
ELISE WILL--
SHE'LL FIRE ME!

16:53.092 --> 16:54.786
IT'S OK. WE'LL TALK
TO ELISE FOR YOU,

16:54.886 --> 16:56.620
WE'LL TELL HER
YOU'RE WITH US.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.721
WE'LL MAKE IT ALL OK.

17:00.013 --> 17:02.995
I'LL GO.

17:03.095 --> 17:04.122
NO, UH...
PHOEBE SHOULD GO.

17:04.222 --> 17:06.122
YOU'RE THE BEST
WITH POTIONS.

17:06.223 --> 17:07.915
HERE, HONEY,
TAKE MY CAR.

17:08.016 --> 17:10.974
CALL ME
IF THINGS GET WORSE.

17:11.516 --> 17:13.183
PIPER--

17:14.767 --> 17:16.960
THIS POTION TAKES
A WHILE TO BREW,AND WE'RE ALL
OUT OF HYSSOP.

17:17.060 --> 17:18.305
SO WHY DON'T YOU
STAY WITH KAREN
AND START COOKING,

17:18.315 --> 17:20.169
AND I'LL GO
TO THE HERB STORE.

17:20.269 --> 17:22.002
NO. I HAVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

17:22.102 --> 17:24.002
YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME
FOR SAYING THIS,

17:24.103 --> 17:25.421
BUT I THINK
I SAW COLE USE--

17:25.521 --> 17:27.046
NO!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.464
PAIGE, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

17:28.564 --> 17:30.047
NO. THIS IS DIFFERENT.

17:30.147 --> 17:32.005
I THINK I SAW COLE
USE DEMONIC POW--

17:32.105 --> 17:33.215
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:33.315 --> 17:34.341
THERE IS NOTHING
DEMONIC ABOUT COLE,

17:34.441 --> 17:37.008
AND WHETHER
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

17:37.108 --> 17:38.008
HE'S
YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

17:38.108 --> 17:39.175
SO WHATEVER ISSUES
YOU HAVE WITH HIM,

17:39.275 --> 17:41.151
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF.

17:45.109 --> 17:49.071
KAREN, CAN I ASK YOU
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS?

18:15.621 --> 18:19.021
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST FELT HIM

18:19.121 --> 18:20.981
DO SOMETHING
BEHIND ME.

18:21.081 --> 18:23.022
SOMETHING LIKE WHAT?

18:23.122 --> 18:24.457
DID YOU SEE HIM
DO ANYTHING?

18:24.999 --> 18:28.023
WHO ARE YOU?

18:28.123 --> 18:29.275
WHY DID YOU
BRING ME HERE?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.275
PAIGE, HAVE YOU
SEEN PIPER AROUND?

18:31.376 --> 18:34.193
YEAH,
SHE'S ALREADY LEFT.

18:34.293 --> 18:37.026
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ON CLUB DUTY?

18:37.126 --> 18:38.654
WELL, I'D MUCH RATHER
BE ON MY HONEYMOON.

18:38.754 --> 18:41.028
WHO IS SHE? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

18:41.128 --> 18:43.989
NO. SHE'S AN INNOCENT.
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.030
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

18:47.130 --> 18:49.281
I THINK I SAW COLE
USING MAGICAL POWERS.

18:49.381 --> 18:52.617
WHAT?

18:52.717 --> 18:53.617
YES.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.032
NOW, I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

18:55.132 --> 18:56.993
BUT I THINK
I SAW HIS HAND GLOW.

18:57.093 --> 18:59.827
PAIGE--

18:59.927 --> 19:01.244
NO, LOOK.

19:01.344 --> 19:02.370
THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON.

19:02.470 --> 19:04.035
THERE'S ALL
THE ELABORATE GIFTS,

19:04.135 --> 19:05.579
AND THEN HE'S
GOT THE $50,000 CAR.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.371
WHAT KIND OF JOB
COMES WITH PERKS LIKE THAT?

19:07.471 --> 19:10.288
SO COLE GETS
A COMPANY CAR

19:10.388 --> 19:12.038
AND THAT
AUTOMATICALLY
MAKES HIM

19:12.138 --> 19:13.039
A DEMON
IN YOUR EYES?

19:13.139 --> 19:14.290
NO!

19:14.390 --> 19:16.039
NO, IT'S JUST THAT...

19:16.139 --> 19:18.291
SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT
WITH HIM LATELY,

19:18.391 --> 19:20.543
AND IT'S NOT GOOD.

19:20.643 --> 19:22.709
AM I THE ONLY ONE
SEEING THIS?

19:22.809 --> 19:24.252
WELL, MAYBE
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

19:24.352 --> 19:27.043
WHO WANTS TO SEE IT.

19:27.143 --> 19:28.143
MEANING?

19:30.063 --> 19:30.963
MEANING THAT NO ONE

19:31.063 --> 19:32.421
WANTS TO BE
THE FIFTH WHEEL.

19:32.521 --> 19:34.964
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

19:35.064 --> 19:36.464
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NOT FAIR

19:36.564 --> 19:38.757
IS YOU JUDGING COLE
FOR HIS PAST.

19:38.857 --> 19:41.424
HE'S NOT A DEMON
ANYMORE,

19:41.524 --> 19:43.983
AND HE'S PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

20:02.155 --> 20:05.699
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

20:08.867 --> 20:12.058
THANK YOU.

20:12.158 --> 20:13.158
PAIGE SAW ME
USING MY POWERS.

20:14.869 --> 20:16.727
WHAT? YOU'VE
BEEN EXPOSED?

20:16.827 --> 20:18.937
NOT NECESSARILY.

20:19.037 --> 20:19.979
SHE'S NOT CERTAIN
WHAT SHE SAW.

20:20.079 --> 20:21.371
NEVERTHELESS,
SHE MUST DIE.

20:22.161 --> 20:23.412
A LITTLE SUBTLETY.

20:25.455 --> 20:27.163
THAT WOULD HARDLY PUT
PHOEBE IN AN AMOROUS MOOD,

20:28.790 --> 20:31.399
AND I'M TOO CLOSE NOW
TO ABANDON MY PLAN.

20:31.499 --> 20:33.233
IF ONE OF THE WITCHES
IS ON TO YOU,

20:33.333 --> 20:35.065
MORE THAN YOUR PLAN
IS AT RISK.

20:35.165 --> 20:38.066
STILL, SHE'S NOT SURE
SHE CAN TRUST HER OWN EYES.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.986
AND I THINK
I KNOW A WAY

20:41.086 --> 20:42.361
TO MAKE SURE
NO ONE TRUSTS

20:42.461 --> 20:43.861
WHAT PAIGE SAYS
SHE SAW.

20:43.961 --> 20:45.320
HOW?

20:45.420 --> 20:47.404
THE INNOCENT
THE GIRLS BROUGHT HOME

20:47.504 --> 20:49.446
WAS INFECTED
BY A POWER-BROKER.

20:49.546 --> 20:51.906
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

20:52.006 --> 20:53.573
IF I COULD
GET A POWER-BROKER

20:53.673 --> 20:54.824
TO DO THE SAME TO PAIGE,

20:54.924 --> 20:56.072
SHE'LL BECOME
UNSTABLE AS WELL.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.491
BUT BY THE TIME
SHE REACHED BREAKING POINT,

20:57.591 --> 21:00.199
HER SISTERS WILL
BE ON THEIR HONEYMOONS.

21:00.299 --> 21:02.634
SHE COULD ALERT THEM.

21:04.301 --> 21:07.995
NOT IF I ACCELERATE
HER SLIDE,

21:08.095 --> 21:10.495
PUSH HER PAST FEAR
AND INTO PARANOIA.

21:10.595 --> 21:13.830
THEN SHE WON'T
TRUST THEM ENOUGH

21:13.930 --> 21:15.388
TO ALERT THEM.

21:20.598 --> 21:23.916
WHO DID THIS?!

21:24.016 --> 21:24.917
WHO PULLED ME HERE?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.960
I DID.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.459
THE SOURCE?

21:29.559 --> 21:31.852
YOU LIVE.

21:33.184 --> 21:36.838
LET'S JUST KEEP THAT
BETWEEN US FOR NOW.

21:36.938 --> 21:40.087
I HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR YOU.

21:40.187 --> 21:43.088
IF YOU SUCCEED,
YOU'LL BE REWARDED

21:43.188 --> 21:44.731
WITH MORE POWER THAN
YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

21:52.651 --> 21:56.111
WOW. HI. YOU ARE?

21:57.192 --> 22:00.303
MARRIED.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.094
HONEYMOONING
TONIGHT.

22:02.194 --> 22:03.904
YEAH,
CANNOT WAIT.

22:04.194 --> 22:07.389
UM, EXCUSE ME.

22:07.489 --> 22:09.806
I'M ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

22:09.906 --> 22:11.407
A BOSS-TYPE SOMEONE.
HER NAME IS ELISE.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.269
WHAT?!

22:24.369 --> 22:26.202
HI. I'M HERE ON BEHALF
OF KAREN YOUNG.

22:26.954 --> 22:30.104
SHE HAS FALLEN ILL--

22:30.204 --> 22:31.313
TELL HER SHE'S FIRED.

22:31.413 --> 22:32.439
WHAT? NO, NO!

22:32.539 --> 22:34.104
WHEN SHE'S LATE,
I'M LATE.

22:34.204 --> 22:35.857
I'M AN EDITOR
WITH BETTER THINGS TO DO

22:35.957 --> 22:37.189
THAN TO WAIT
AROUND FOR HER.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.566
NO, BUT SHE'S
NOT GONNA BE LATE.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.691
IS SHE LATE ALREADY?

22:40.792 --> 22:42.150
DEADLINE'S 8:00 TONIGHT.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.108
AND I THOUGHT
YOU SAID SHE WAS SICK.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.776
WELL,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

22:45.876 --> 22:47.402
TO PICK UP
HER ASSIGNMENT

22:47.502 --> 22:49.069
AND BRING IT TO HER.

22:49.169 --> 22:50.248
BELIEVE ME, NOTHING IS
MORE IMPORTANT TO KAREN

22:50.258 --> 22:52.110
THAN REPORTING THE NEWS.

22:52.210 --> 22:55.211
I WOULD HARDLY CALL
THE ADVICE COLUMN NEWS.

23:00.423 --> 23:04.114
THIS WEEK'S LETTERS
ARE PROBABLY

23:04.214 --> 23:05.241
ON THIS TRAIN WRECK
OF A DESK.

23:05.341 --> 23:08.117
WOW, THAT'S
A LOT OF MAIL.

23:08.217 --> 23:10.035
YEAH, SHE'S
GOT A FOLLOWING,

23:10.135 --> 23:11.493
SO SHE MUST BE
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

23:11.593 --> 23:13.118
UM...

23:13.218 --> 23:14.339
SINCE THERE'S
SO MUCH TRAFFIC RIGHT NOW

23:14.349 --> 23:17.287

34:29.565 --> 34:31.108
IT'S BROKEN.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.300
OH.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.635
OK, WELL, THERE'S
MORE AT THE MANOR.NO, UH, THERE'S
NOT, ACTUALLY.

34:35.735 --> 34:37.342
PAIGE BROKE THAT ONE TOO.

34:37.442 --> 34:38.342
WHAT--WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

34:38.443 --> 34:40.094
THAT TOOK FOREVER TO MAKE.
SHE COULD DIE IF
WE HAVE TO MAKE MORE.

34:40.195 --> 34:43.344
[Phoebe] HOW DID
WE NOT NOTICE?

34:43.444 --> 34:44.847
OH...

34:44.947 --> 34:46.054
SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT NOT TRUSTING COLE.

34:46.155 --> 34:48.056
IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME
THAT SHE MIGHT BE INFECTED.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

34:48.156 --> 34:51.239
NO,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT.

34:52.447 --> 34:53.114
LEO.
SHE'S BURNING UP.

34:55.949 --> 34:57.934
I TRIED TO HEAL HER.
I CAN'T.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.349
[Piper] WELL, WHAT
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,

34:59.449 --> 35:00.445
JUST STAND HERE
AND WATCH HER DIE?

35:00.455 --> 35:02.350
OH, NO, NO, NO.

35:02.450 --> 35:04.244
THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING.
NOT AGAIN.

35:09.205 --> 35:12.354
THERE IS A WAY.

35:12.454 --> 35:13.956
WE NEED
TO FIND A POWER-BROKER
TO PULL IT OUT OF HER.

35:16.165 --> 35:19.356
I BLEW HIM UP!

35:19.456 --> 35:21.357
THERE'S OTHERS.

35:21.457 --> 35:22.959
YOU'LL HAVE TO ORB ME
UNDERGROUND.

35:23.457 --> 35:25.085
WE'LL ALL GO.

35:26.668 --> 35:27.610
NO. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.360
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND
OF POWERS THEY MIGHT HAVE.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.195
BESIDES, YOUR POWERS
MIGHT NOT WORK TOO WELL
DOWN THERE.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.404
COLE, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY POWERS!

35:33.504 --> 35:36.322
[Piper] COLE, THERE'S
NO TIME TO ARGUE.

35:36.422 --> 35:37.797
WE'RE GOING.

35:39.005 --> 35:42.131
LET ME
GET DRESSED.

35:46.633 --> 35:50.717
SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN ENERGY BALL
FOR A LIGHTNING BOLT.

35:52.468 --> 35:56.036
[Leo] WHAT ARE
THEY DOING?

35:56.136 --> 35:57.203
[Cole] TRADING POWERS.

35:57.303 --> 35:58.369
SO WHAT
DO WE DO?

35:58.469 --> 35:59.787
WELL--

35:59.887 --> 36:01.580
WE BARGE IN.
GET PAIGE.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.705
[Cole] WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT!

36:02.805 --> 36:03.831
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

36:03.931 --> 36:05.581
BUT I THINK ONE OF YOU
MAY HAVE MISPLACED A POWER.

36:05.681 --> 36:08.372
I'LL GET HER.

36:08.472 --> 36:09.708
YOU GET READY
TO ORB THEM OUT OF HERE.

36:09.808 --> 36:11.541
WHO ARE YOU?

36:11.641 --> 36:12.583
WE'RE
THE CHARMED ONES,

36:12.683 --> 36:14.209
AND ONE
OF YOU JACKASSES
INFECTED OUR SISTER.

36:14.309 --> 36:17.375
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY HARD
TO TELL WHICH JACKASS,
THOUGH, HUH?

36:17.475 --> 36:20.586
[Piper] SO,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

36:20.686 --> 36:22.503
WE'LL SPARE
YOUR LIVES

36:22.603 --> 36:24.170
IF YOU PULL YOUR
SKANKY LITTLE POWER
OUT OF HER.

36:24.270 --> 36:27.964
THE POWER OF
THE CHARMED ONES LIES
IN THE POWER OF THREE.

36:28.064 --> 36:31.257
YOU'RE ONE WITCH DOWN.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.107
UM, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO TEST
THAT THEORY?

36:37.482 --> 36:40.776
TOO BAD. YOU LOSE.

36:42.526 --> 36:45.844
TOLD YOU ABOUT
YOUR POWERS DOWN HERE.

36:45.944 --> 36:47.928
SHH.

36:48.028 --> 36:48.928
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

36:49.028 --> 36:50.113
KEEP IN MIND

36:51.321 --> 36:52.388
THAT THAT WAS
JUST A WARNING.

36:52.488 --> 36:54.487
NEXT TIME, I'LL
USE FULL FORCE.

36:55.197 --> 36:56.488
FORGIVE US. WE'LL
DO WHATEVER YOU ASK.

36:58.949 --> 37:01.490
SEE, NOW, THAT'S MORE
LIKE IT RIGHT THERE.

37:02.533 --> 37:04.491
MM-HMM.

37:05.617 --> 37:08.810
WELL?

37:08.910 --> 37:10.476
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

37:10.577 --> 37:11.869
AHEM.

37:13.787 --> 37:14.954
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

37:35.877 --> 37:39.112
WHERE AM I?

37:39.212 --> 37:40.402
[Phoebe] YOU'RE
GONNA BE OK, SWEETIE.

37:40.502 --> 37:41.905
ALL RIGHT, NOW CAN
WE GET OUT OF HERE?

37:42.005 --> 37:43.503
[Piper] WAIT.

37:45.423 --> 37:48.405
[SNORTS]

37:48.505 --> 37:50.299
HAD ENOUGH POWER
TO DO THAT.

37:53.591 --> 37:56.759
SHH.

38:06.179 --> 38:10.512
WHY WOULD YOU SAVE PAIGE
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU DID
TO DESTROY HER?

38:11.973 --> 38:15.749
THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND
A WAY TO SAVE HER ANYWAY.

38:15.849 --> 38:18.416
THIS WAY
I GET THE CREDIT.

38:18.516 --> 38:20.083
DID YOU DO IT
FOR CREDIT?

38:20.183 --> 38:21.834
OR LOVE?

38:21.934 --> 38:24.517
I SUPPOSE
THERE'S SOME THINGS EVEN
THE SOURCE CAN'T DEFEAT.

38:27.518 --> 38:28.769
CAREFUL.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.921
I AM, BUT ARE YOU?

38:32.021 --> 38:34.297
WE HAVE WORKED TOO HARD

38:34.397 --> 38:35.646
TO LET A NUGGET OF HUMANITY
DESTROY A LEGACY OF EVIL.

38:37.521 --> 38:40.715
PAIGE HAS NO MEMORY.

38:40.815 --> 38:42.507
SHE'S NOT A THREAT
TO US ANYMORE.

38:42.607 --> 38:44.216
I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT HER.

38:44.316 --> 38:45.842
I'M TALKING ABOUT COLE.

38:45.942 --> 38:48.052
HE'S THE ONE THREAT
NEITHER ONE OF US
CAN CONTROL.

38:48.152 --> 38:51.069
HE SAVED PAIGE, NOT YOU.

38:51.652 --> 38:55.012
I'M NOT CONCERNED.

38:55.112 --> 38:57.280
THERE WILL BE
NOTHING HE CAN DO
ONCE PHOEBE'S PREGNANT.

38:59.528 --> 39:00.114
IS SHE?

39:11.325 --> 39:14.433
WELL?

39:14.533 --> 39:15.744
I SEE
CONFLICTING FUTURES.

39:17.827 --> 39:20.535
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

39:27.122 --> 39:30.539
âª HEY, YEAH âª

39:31.665 --> 39:35.150
âª I'M BIG TROUBLE âª

39:35.250 --> 39:38.441
âª LOTS OF FUN âª

39:38.541 --> 39:39.652
âª MAKE THAT
A DOUBLE, YEAH âª

39:39.752 --> 39:41.735
âª NOT A SINGLE ONE âª

39:41.835 --> 39:43.819
âª DON'T TAKE ME HOME âª

39:43.919 --> 39:45.737
âª TO YOUR MOTHER, YEAH âª

39:45.837 --> 39:48.337
âª WHEN IT'S OVER
AND I SET YOU FREE âª

39:48.796 --> 39:52.446
âª I PROMISE
YOU'LL REMEMBER ME âª

39:52.546 --> 39:55.115
âª YEAH âª

39:55.215 --> 39:56.115
âª AS BIG TROUBLE âª

39:56.215 --> 39:58.658
âª OH âª

39:58.758 --> 40:00.241
âª LOTS OF FUN âª

40:00.341 --> 40:02.509
[AUDIENCE
CHEERS AND APPLAUDS]

40:04.634 --> 40:08.286
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DESTROYED THE HOUSE.

40:08.386 --> 40:10.245
[Phoebe] MMM.

40:10.345 --> 40:11.547
WHAT I CAN'T BELIEVE
IS WHAT YOU ALMOST SAW

40:11.557 --> 40:12.996
IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

40:13.096 --> 40:14.453
IF YOU HAD GOTTEN THERE
5 MINUTES EARLIER--
[LAUGHS]

40:14.553 --> 40:17.454
OH, LA LA LA LA!

40:17.554 --> 40:18.538
OVERSHARING!

40:18.638 --> 40:19.973
HEY, KAREN!

40:21.057 --> 40:22.456
OH, I HOPED
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

40:22.556 --> 40:24.874
DO WE KNOW HER?

40:24.974 --> 40:25.959
WOW, YOUR MEMORY
REALLY IS SHOT.

40:26.059 --> 40:28.751
UM, YOU TOLD
"FEARFUL IN MARIN"
TO GET A DOG.

40:28.851 --> 40:31.502
YEAH! OH.

40:31.602 --> 40:32.710
I KNOW, I KNOW.

40:32.810 --> 40:34.169
IT JUST--IT SEEMED
RIGHT AT THE TIME,

40:34.270 --> 40:35.753
YOU KNOW, SO SHE
DIDN'T HAVE TO--

40:35.853 --> 40:37.128
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER
TO GET A THERAPIST

40:37.228 --> 40:38.921
AND GET A LIFE.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.046
OH, YEAH--
YOU SEE?

40:40.146 --> 40:41.462
THIS IS
WHAT I SAID.

40:41.562 --> 40:42.980
HERS WAS BETTER.

40:43.230 --> 40:46.464
WOW, REALLY?

40:46.564 --> 40:47.257
YEAH. IT WAS PRO-ACTIVE,

40:47.357 --> 40:48.548
IT WAS NONJUDGMENTAL.

40:48.648 --> 40:50.465
THE WHOLE COLUMN
HAD A FRESHNESS

40:50.565 --> 40:51.978
AND A PASSION
THAT IT HASN'T HAD
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

40:51.988 --> 40:54.842
OH, W-W-

40:54.942 --> 40:56.467
THANK YOU.

40:56.567 --> 40:57.927
AND I'M GOING TO TELL
ELISE THAT YOU WROTE IT.

40:58.027 --> 41:00.053
OH, NO! KAREN,
DON'T DO THAT.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.469
I MEAN, SHE'LL
FIRE YOU, THEN.

41:02.569 --> 41:04.470
AND MY GUESS
IS SHE'LL HIRE YOU

41:04.570 --> 41:06.805
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
WORKING FOR THAT WITCH.

41:06.905 --> 41:09.471
[Piper] HMM.

41:09.571 --> 41:10.471
I THOUGHT OF HER
MORE AS A DEMON.

41:10.571 --> 41:12.140
WELL, EITHER WAY,
I HATE HER.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.433
AND EVEN THROUGH I'M NOT
SURE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

41:15.533 --> 41:17.867
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I WANNA SPEND MORE TIME
AT HOME WITH MY KID.

41:19.284 --> 41:22.518
SO I WANNA
SAY THANKS.

41:22.618 --> 41:24.576
FOR EVERYTHING.

41:26.577 --> 41:29.579
THAT IS VERY SWEET.

41:31.788 --> 41:35.190
WHAT JUST
HAPPENED THERE?

41:35.290 --> 41:36.773
I THINK...

41:36.873 --> 41:38.524
THAT PHOEBE
JUST GOT A JOB.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.983
[LAUGHS]

41:41.083 --> 41:43.875
NO, I CAN'T.
[LAUGHS]

41:44.583 --> 41:46.583
CAN I?

41:47.668 --> 41:48.652
PHOEBE, SOMEBODY'S
GOING TO PAY YOU

41:48.752 --> 41:50.485
TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT TO DO.

41:50.585 --> 41:52.486
SHUT UP
AND BE HAPPY.

41:52.586 --> 41:53.737
HMM.

41:53.837 --> 41:55.154
TO PHOEBE.
MAY YOU NEVER GIVE
ANY LETHAL ADVICE.

41:55.254 --> 41:57.989
MMM. AND TO PIPER.

41:58.089 --> 42:00.281
MAY YOU ACTUALLY
GET TO GO ON YOUR
HONEYMOON TOMORROW.

42:00.381 --> 42:02.407
[SIGHS]

42:02.508 --> 42:04.091
AND TO PAIGE--

42:05.007 --> 42:05.992
MAY I NEVER TRY
TO KILL YOU AGAIN.

42:06.092 --> 42:08.490
OH, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY A HALLIWELL

42:08.591 --> 42:10.201
UNTIL
YOU'VE GONE DEMONIC

42:10.301 --> 42:11.368
ON YOUR SISTERS
AT LEAST TWICE.

42:11.468 --> 42:13.177
ACTUALLY...

42:14.260 --> 42:15.744
SHE DIDN'T GO
DEMONIC ON US.

42:15.844 --> 42:18.413
SHE WENT DEMONIC
ON COLE.

42:18.513 --> 42:20.537
YOU SAY TOMATO,
AND I SAY--

42:20.637 --> 42:23.122
KAREN ALREADY
HATED ELISE.

42:23.222 --> 42:26.348
THAT'S WHY ELISE
BECAME THE OBJECT
OF KAREN'S DEMONIC RAGE.

42:28.598 --> 42:31.475
WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT
YOU ALREADY HATED COLE.

42:34.476 --> 42:36.601
NO, I DON'T
HATE COLE, PHOEBE.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.601
I JUST
DON'T TRUST HIM.

42:41.977 --> 42:43.962
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I FEEL THAT WAY,

42:44.062 --> 42:46.271
I JUST--I DON'T.

42:47.146 --> 42:50.523
I'M SORRY.

42:51.815 --> 42:54.882
YEAH.

42:54.982 --> 42:57.024
SO AM I.
