12:22.018 --> 12:24.002
We're sorry,
everyone.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.029
We just
wanted a normal
birthday party.

12:27.001 --> 12:29.010
But everything
went wrong.

12:29.012 --> 12:31.025
Our birthday
was a disaster.

12:31.027 --> 12:33.008
Ha! Are you kidding?

12:33.010 --> 12:35.028
That was the greatest
birthday party ever!

12:36.000 --> 12:38.002
Yes! It was super--

12:38.004 --> 12:40.005
super heroic!

12:40.007 --> 12:41.006
You see, girls?

12:41.008 --> 12:43.026
Everything turned
out all right.

a doozy of a toothache.

your own normal powers.

to take a bath,

20:12.010 --> 20:13.020
then he will
get shocked!

to find a bathtub
to fit the monster?

get a toaster?

your toaster.
