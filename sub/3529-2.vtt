WEBVTT

00:00.955 --> 00:02.555
Previously on "The Tudors"

00:02.556 --> 00:04.955
We are come here together to join
Henry the Eight

00:05.057 --> 00:06.957
and the Lady Jane Seymour

00:06.958 --> 00:08.758
If the new Queen favours the Catholic religion

00:08.759 --> 00:10.659
As she's rumoured to do

00:10.660 --> 00:12.660
The our whole reformation
is surely in jeopardy

00:12.661 --> 00:14.961
We must press ahead with the
dissolution of the monastery

00:15.962 --> 00:18.762
Mr Lust.. before our lands are taken
from us by the church commissioners,

00:19.063 --> 00:20.863
We will fight!

00:20.864 --> 00:21.864
And we will die!

00:21.865 --> 00:23.865
What am I supposed to do John?

00:23.866 --> 00:25.666
I need Captains,

00:25.667 --> 00:27.667
clever, educated men
to lead them

00:27.668 --> 00:29.568
Majesty, why will you not speak to me?

00:29.569 --> 00:31.569
I'm disappointed because
you're not yet with child

00:31.570 --> 00:33.170
That's all

00:33.171 --> 00:35.171
What's your name?

00:35.172 --> 00:36.872
Lady Ursula Misseldon

00:36.873 --> 00:38.373
You know who I am?

00:38.374 --> 00:40.174
You're Sir Francis Bright

00:40.175 --> 00:41.875
I've heard about you

00:41.876 --> 00:43.876
I was wondering if you'd like
to become my mistress

00:43.877 --> 00:46.677
I promise you that I will continue to
show favour to the Lady Mary

00:46.678 --> 00:48.178
I would give more pleasure than I can say

00:48.179 --> 00:50.479
to see you reconciled with your father

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Mary?

00:51.481 --> 00:54.181
The great part of the North has risen
in sudden rebellion against his Majesty

00:54.182 --> 00:56.182
They want the monasteries restored

00:56.183 --> 00:58.083
And their churches unmolested

00:58.084 --> 01:00.184
Some say, that not hundreds but thousands

01:00.185 --> 01:01.985
Are risen

01:01.986 --> 01:03.786
You told me that there was little opposition

01:03.787 --> 01:06.487
You told me that most people were glad
to see such places dissolved

01:07.488 --> 01:09.588
You were wrong!

01:09.589 --> 01:11.589
I'm appointing you commander
of the royal forces

01:11.590 --> 01:13.190
These rebels are traitors Charles

01:13.191 --> 01:14.691
They must be punished

01:14.692 --> 01:16.692
Cromwell is being blamed for everything

01:16.693 --> 01:18.293
And the rebels are demanding his head

01:19.294 --> 01:21.594
with God's help, I may well
be able to deliver it

01:22.278 --> 01:24.878
Now is the time to arise!

01:24.879 --> 01:26.679
Forward to York. Forward!

01:26.680 --> 01:28.180
In God's name!

01:28.181 --> 01:29.681
Forward!

~ Season 3 - Episode 2 ~
"The Northern Uprising"

02:53.236 --> 02:56.071
Sir Thomas.

02:56.072 --> 02:59.875
- What's the news?
- This matter hangs like a fever

02:59.876 --> 03:01.977
one day good, another bad.

03:01.978 --> 03:05.581
With the promise of a pardon,
and the threat of an advancing

03:05.582 --> 03:08.334
royal army, the rebels in
Lincolnshire have dispersed

03:08.335 --> 03:11.937
- and gone home.
- And in Yorkshire?

03:19.646 --> 03:22.565
In Yorkshire and the
whole North we are facing

03:22.566 --> 03:26.569
the most dangerous insurrection
that has ever been seen.

03:26.570 --> 03:29.522
The rebels entered the
town of York three days ago

03:29.523 --> 03:32.007
and celebrated mass in the
cathedral; some say they intend

03:32.008 --> 03:35.578
to march South.

03:55.682 --> 03:58.467
- "Your Majesty, I write
to you on an urgent matter.

03:58.468 --> 04:02.238
"We've had word that a
pilgrim army is marching

04:02.239 --> 04:04.390
"on to Pontefract Castle,
which is under my command.

04:04.391 --> 04:10.062
"I am compelled to tell you
that I can't defend this castle

04:10.063 --> 04:12.648
"without more soldiers and arms.

04:12.649 --> 04:17.303
"As the warden of the East
Marches and a loyal member

04:17.303 --> 04:19.305
"of Your Majesty's council

04:19.305 --> 04:23.309
"I beg Your Majesty to consider
negotiating with these pilgrims.

04:23.310 --> 04:28.964
I remain your humble and
obedient servant. Darcy."

04:42.679 --> 04:45.831
What is it? What have you found?

04:45.832 --> 04:47.683
A splinter of bone, Your Majesty.

04:47.684 --> 04:51.587
You told me before it was an
ulcer. That it was easily cured!

04:51.588 --> 04:53.589
A wound like this, Your Majesty...

04:53.590 --> 04:58.444
Jesus Christ! You don't know
what it is, do you? Do you?

04:58.445 --> 05:01.697
Your Majesty must not be
alarmed. We shall apply

05:01.698 --> 05:03.599
a poultice to draw any more
splinters to the surface.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.602
Then we shall look to other remedies

05:06.603 --> 05:09.254
to heal permanently
Your Majesty's wound.

05:09.255 --> 05:12.257
You treat me like a fool.

05:12.258 --> 05:15.761
Everyone here treats me like a fool.

05:15.762 --> 05:18.047
Get out.

05:18.048 --> 05:22.217
Get out!
- Majesty...

05:22.218 --> 05:24.620
You're quacks and charlatans.

05:24.621 --> 05:27.389
I will find my own remedies.

05:47.043 --> 05:50.145
- Your Grace.
- My Lord,

05:50.146 --> 05:52.498
I was promised artillery
when I arrived here.

05:52.499 --> 05:55.150
But I don't see any guns.

05:55.151 --> 05:58.804
Your Grace, we have guns but
we have not been unable to find

05:58.805 --> 06:00.656
any horses or drays to transport them.

06:00.657 --> 06:04.309
Perhaps you don't understand.

06:04.310 --> 06:07.312
I am about the King's
most urgent business.

06:07.313 --> 06:10.315
And if you cannot commandeer
some horses for his Majesty's

06:10.316 --> 06:13.419
use then how can you call
yourself Mayor of London?

06:13.420 --> 06:16.422
Your Grace, I did not want to
produce panic by forcing people

06:16.423 --> 06:18.574
to part with their horses or drays.

06:18.575 --> 06:20.693
IDIOT!

06:20.694 --> 06:22.528
I charge you

06:22.529 --> 06:25.431
personally to find enough
horses within two days and bring

06:25.432 --> 06:29.435
the guns on after our army
- or God help me I will hold you

06:29.436 --> 06:33.439
to account. With any luck, Mr.
Mayor, I will afterwards get

06:33.440 --> 06:36.792
the chance to see you
disemboweled at Tyburn!

06:48.104 --> 06:50.456
- Lady Rochford?
- Madam,

06:50.457 --> 06:54.059
the King is still confined to his
chambers by his physicians' orders,

06:54.060 --> 06:57.112
but sends his regrets
and hopes you are well.

06:57.113 --> 07:03.118
I worry for him so much.
Especially at such a time.

07:03.119 --> 07:05.070
Your Majesty is right to do so.

07:05.071 --> 07:08.323
These rebels are nothing but villains;

07:08.324 --> 07:12.077
they are totally alienated
from true religion.

07:12.078 --> 07:14.079
They want to take us
back to the dark days

07:14.080 --> 07:18.550
of ignorance and
superstition. And by force!

07:18.551 --> 07:21.553
I hope to God they
will soon be overcome.

07:21.554 --> 07:24.556
- Yes. Lady Rochford,

07:24.557 --> 07:26.258
I have something I wish
you to arrange for me.

07:26.259 --> 07:31.396
I'm sure it will give the
King a great deal of pleasure.

07:54.921 --> 07:58.524
My God, Lord Darcy.
What a sight is there!

07:58.525 --> 08:02.528
Arrant rebels against the King's Majesty

08:02.529 --> 08:05.531
brazenly bearing their badges of shame!

08:05.532 --> 08:07.533
Indeed so, Your Grace.

08:07.534 --> 08:12.538
I never thought in all my
long days to see such a sight.

08:12.539 --> 08:15.541
What are you going to do? Fire on them?

08:15.542 --> 08:18.894
You know very well I have
almost no useful guns.

08:18.895 --> 08:21.547
You could resist them all the
same, and close your gates.

08:21.548 --> 08:25.551
After all those are the King's orders.

08:25.552 --> 08:29.905
As to that, I think it
better to talk to them first,

08:29.906 --> 08:33.659
as fellow Englishmen
and fellow Christians.

08:33.659 --> 08:38.212
I'll meet their leaders
outside the castle walls.

08:38.214 --> 08:40.082
Guards!

08:57.934 --> 09:04.189
- My Lord Darcy, Your Grace, we come here in peace.
- Mr. Aske.

09:04.190 --> 09:07.092
As the King's representative
I have the means here

09:07.093 --> 09:12.097
to hinder you and to do
some injury to your cause.

09:12.098 --> 09:14.099
My Lord, we have embarked
upon this Pilgrimage of Grace

09:14.100 --> 09:17.502
for the common good, for the
love we bear to God's faith,

09:17.503 --> 09:19.621
our Holy Church and
the maintenance of it,

09:19.622 --> 09:23.108
for the preservation
of our sovereign King

09:23.109 --> 09:27.112
and the expulsion of villain's
blood and evil councilors.

09:27.113 --> 09:29.965
We mean to petition the King's highness

09:29.966 --> 09:34.870
to stop the woeful destruction
of our monasteries and abbeys.

09:34.871 --> 09:38.523
Master Aske, you claim
to be loyal to the King

09:38.524 --> 09:43.528
but your very actions defy
and deny the King's supremacy!

09:43.529 --> 09:47.532
Lord Archbishop, there is
no man now alive in England

09:47.533 --> 09:51.403
more loyal to the King than I
am. I trust in time to prove it.

09:51.404 --> 09:54.640
Our quarrel lies not with him, but only

09:54.641 --> 09:56.658
with those close to him.
- It's very well for you

09:56.659 --> 09:59.995
to sound so high and
mighty, but you and your kind

09:59.996 --> 10:03.899
are also to blame for not
advising the King honestly

10:03.900 --> 10:08.503
about the spread of heresy and
abuse throughout his kingdom.

10:08.504 --> 10:12.658
For what are Cromwell
and Cranmer but heretics

10:12.659 --> 10:14.309
and manifest abusers
of this commonwealth?

10:14.310 --> 10:18.814
Lord Darcy, as I told you

10:18.815 --> 10:21.016
we mean no displeasure to any person.

10:21.017 --> 10:23.568
We ask for shelter and free passage.

10:23.569 --> 10:26.772
All our pilgrims have taken an oath

10:26.773 --> 10:34.029
not to slay or murder out
of envy, but to put away fear

10:34.030 --> 10:38.083
for the commonwealth and
march with the cross of Christ

10:38.084 --> 10:41.286
and their heart's faith before them.

10:41.287 --> 10:48.844
But we will fight and die
if you seek to stop us.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.102
I am putting you in charge
of the defenses here the city.

10:57.103 --> 11:01.456
We shall need to organize new
levies. Send word to every lords

11:01.457 --> 11:04.109
and gentlemen to be ready with
his power. Take all the weapons,

11:04.110 --> 11:06.461
harness and ordnance
you need from the Tower.

11:06.462 --> 11:09.564
Buy more if you need to from
the merchants in the city.

11:09.565 --> 11:12.484
Then it's true. We are in trouble.

11:14.070 --> 11:17.572
Mr. Cromwell, His Majesty
will receive you now.

11:31.487 --> 11:35.490
I've just received a
letter from Lord Darcy.

11:35.491 --> 11:38.143
He says that he is in
great danger from the rebels

11:38.144 --> 11:41.997
and cannot maintain his resistance.

11:41.998 --> 11:45.350
And yet he holds a
castle. A great stronghold.

11:45.351 --> 11:49.254
Does he not mean to stand
firm against these traitors?

11:49.255 --> 11:51.907
Your Majesty, I've just been told

11:51.908 --> 11:55.610
that the rebels have already
entered the town of Pontefract

11:55.611 --> 11:57.412
with overwhelming numbers.

12:00.416 --> 12:01.917
Mr. Cromwell...

12:06.372 --> 12:09.925
Pontefract is the gateway to the South.

12:09.926 --> 12:12.544
It has great strategic importance.

12:14.781 --> 12:18.133
You will write a letter
to Lord Darcy at once.

12:18.134 --> 12:21.686
You will tell him that I expect him

12:21.687 --> 12:23.789
to hold that castle at all costs!

12:23.790 --> 12:25.440
Yes, Your Majesty.

12:25.441 --> 12:28.393
And what of the royal army?

12:28.394 --> 12:30.195
What are they doing to
crush this rebellion?

12:30.196 --> 12:32.647
Where is his Grace the Duke of Suffolk?

12:32.648 --> 12:36.451
And that bastard
Shrewsbury! I told him too!

12:38.805 --> 12:42.157
What in God's name are these men doing?

13:02.145 --> 13:04.579
Lord Darcy.

13:04.580 --> 13:07.232
My Lord!

13:09.435 --> 13:10.986
Darcy and York have betrayed me?

13:10.987 --> 13:13.989
Well, we shall see
what end they come to!

13:13.990 --> 13:15.991
And why haven't Shrewsbury
and Suffolk attacked yet?

13:15.992 --> 13:20.695
All I hear are their
complaints and their excuses!

13:20.696 --> 13:22.864
You know what I think?

13:22.865 --> 13:25.750
I think they have become
afraid of their own shadows!

13:25.751 --> 13:28.670
I have a mind to go North myself.

13:28.671 --> 13:32.858
I'll lead the army! I'll
teach these bastard ingrates

13:32.859 --> 13:37.512
and rebels a fearful
bloody lesson in slaughter!

13:47.123 --> 13:49.474
I wish Your Majesty would
not consider doing so.

13:49.475 --> 13:52.277
Why? Do you suppose I'm too feeble?

13:52.278 --> 13:54.980
I meant that Your Majesty's
life is far too precious

13:54.981 --> 13:57.983
to be put at risk against
such a common rabble.

13:57.984 --> 14:00.886
Of course if you chose to go, you
would be like a lion among wolves.

14:00.887 --> 14:04.656
Sir Francis, I don't
require you to flatter me.

14:04.657 --> 14:06.291
No, Your Majesty.

14:06.292 --> 14:09.644
Send a plain message to Suffolk.

14:09.645 --> 14:12.647
Ask him why he refuses
to obey my commands

14:12.648 --> 14:14.499
and ask him if he is a coward.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.152
- Majesty.
- And Mr. Cromwell!

14:17.153 --> 14:20.305
If things go badly, I know
well enough who to blame.

14:28.664 --> 14:31.066
Can I get Your Majesty
anything for your pain?

14:31.067 --> 14:36.421
Yes, I believe you can.

15:00.346 --> 15:02.714
- Your Grace, the Earl
of Shrewsbury is here.

15:07.270 --> 15:09.354
- My Lord.
- Your Grace.

15:09.355 --> 15:11.456
Men dismissed.

15:11.457 --> 15:13.108
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.368
We meet at a desperate moment, my Lord.

15:23.369 --> 15:25.370
Not only are the rebel forces

15:25.371 --> 15:27.572
overwhelmingly strong against us,

15:27.573 --> 15:30.825
but those men I do have I cannot
altogether trust. Many of them

15:30.826 --> 15:33.378
I swear think the rebels'
quarrels to be good and godly.

15:36.382 --> 15:41.736
Still, the King has urged us
to attack as soon as possible.

15:41.737 --> 15:44.389
His Majesty would not do
so if he saw our plight

15:44.390 --> 15:46.391
with his own eyes. I
have almost no horsemen,

15:46.392 --> 15:49.494
and those I do have are
rather the flower of the North.

15:49.495 --> 15:51.896
It is not possible your lordship

15:51.897 --> 15:53.748
to give battle knowing
defeat to be a certainty.

15:53.749 --> 15:56.751
- Do you have some other plan?
- I intend to parley with them.

15:56.752 --> 15:58.403
- Parley?
- My Lord,

15:58.404 --> 16:02.757
it's our first duty to stop
them escaping and marching South.

16:02.758 --> 16:05.360
If they are talking
they are not marching.

16:05.361 --> 16:08.763
Then you must tell the King.

16:17.273 --> 16:19.274
Shrewsbury's forces are here...

16:19.275 --> 16:21.126
Suffolk's here, not far from Newark.

16:21.127 --> 16:23.678
It seems likely that they
had originally planned

16:23.679 --> 16:26.381
to hold a line here,
along the River Trent,

16:26.382 --> 16:28.883
to block our advance southwards.

16:28.884 --> 16:31.136
How strong are they?

16:31.137 --> 16:35.440
- We think that Shrewsbury's men
are 6000; Suffolk's a lot less.

16:35.441 --> 16:38.443
They also lack horse and cannon.

16:38.444 --> 16:42.797
- And how many are we?
- By my reckoning,

16:42.798 --> 16:47.652
- somewhere over thirty thousand.
- Thirty Thousand?

16:47.653 --> 16:55.560
We have kept large forces here
at Doncaster, at Jervaux Abbey

16:55.561 --> 16:57.212
and we are presently laying siege

16:57.213 --> 17:00.565
to the Earl of Cumberland's
castle at Skipton.

17:00.566 --> 17:02.817
North of the River Don

17:02.818 --> 17:05.470
we have almost complete
control of the country.

17:09.474 --> 17:12.176
Let them come on to us!

17:12.178 --> 17:16.848
With God on our side, Mr.
Aske, we shall prevail.

17:22.738 --> 17:24.589
Poor you, Your Majesty.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.492
Pour the ointment over it.

17:31.247 --> 17:35.116
I smell sorrel and... linseed?

17:35.117 --> 17:40.004
Meadowplant, crushed pearls,
herb of grace, other things.

17:40.005 --> 17:42.707
I concocted it myself. I
don't trust my physicians.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.460
Hold still!

17:45.461 --> 17:47.512
You're very brave, Lady Misseldon.

17:47.513 --> 17:51.383
Braver, I think, than my Captains.

17:51.384 --> 17:54.886
And much more beautiful.

17:58.774 --> 18:04.896
There, it's done. I trust Your
Majesty is more comfortable.

18:12.288 --> 18:14.906
Does Your Majesty wish me to stay?

18:33.509 --> 18:37.061
It seems we were wrong to
suppose that the King of England

18:37.062 --> 18:41.416
would realize his mistakes
and the dangers to his soul.

18:41.417 --> 18:44.269
Instead he continues
to encourage Cromwel

18:44.270 --> 18:48.173
to vandalize and defile
the houses of God and steal

18:48.174 --> 18:52.827
their treasures, all for
his own use and pleasure.

18:52.828 --> 18:57.582
And yet, even in the
darkness there is a light.

18:57.583 --> 19:02.454
I mean, this great
uprising of the faithful.

19:02.455 --> 19:07.292
This Pilgrimage of Grace.
- I have heard of it too.

19:07.293 --> 19:10.445
The pilgrims who marched
beneath the banner of Christ.

19:10.446 --> 19:14.449
The Holy Father asks you to
write a pamphlet in English

19:14.450 --> 19:18.803
denouncing the King and
his advisors as heretics.

19:18.804 --> 19:21.956
Of course. I will start
work on it straight away.

19:21.957 --> 19:24.309
No, No. Wait, wait.

19:24.310 --> 19:28.213
His Holiness needs more from
you than just your signature.

19:28.214 --> 19:32.217
With my encouragement, he
has decided to appoint you

19:32.218 --> 19:34.869
an official legate.

19:34.870 --> 19:38.473
You will travel to France and
to the Low Countries and meet

19:38.474 --> 19:41.476
representatives of the
King and the Emperor.

19:41.477 --> 19:44.629
- Eminence...?
- You will persuade them

19:44.630 --> 19:48.983
to provide monies, arms and mercenaries

19:48.984 --> 19:53.588
to support this most
Holy Crusade in England.

19:53.589 --> 19:58.142
If that is what His Holiness
asks me to do, then of course

19:58.143 --> 20:03.097
I will do it, like an
obedient son to a father.

20:03.098 --> 20:06.000
His Holiness has agreed

20:06.001 --> 20:08.653
to make you a Cardinal.

20:10.356 --> 20:14.509
And here is your biretta.
- I cannot accept.

20:16.161 --> 20:20.765
- Why not?
- I'm not worthy.

20:20.766 --> 20:23.418
In other words, you
prefer your own judgment

20:23.419 --> 20:26.120
to that of the Pope, your Holy Father.

20:26.121 --> 20:29.123
No doubt you suppose that
makes you seem humble.

20:29.124 --> 20:35.029
But actually it is the
sin of pride for the Pope.

20:42.538 --> 20:46.808
His Grace informs Your Majesty
he has no choice in the matter

20:46.809 --> 20:51.446
but to treat with them...
- In so doing, he hopes to bring

20:51.447 --> 20:53.548
the nobles and the gentry to treachery

20:53.549 --> 20:55.199
and for their own sakes
and their own interests

20:55.200 --> 20:57.552
they will disown the
commons, if promised a pardon

20:57.553 --> 21:00.154
as in fact happened in Lincolnshire.

21:00.155 --> 21:03.308
They are not all to be pardoned.

21:03.309 --> 21:06.961
Not the leaders. Never the leaders.

21:06.962 --> 21:09.314
But what terms does
my Lord Suffolk intend

21:09.315 --> 21:11.566
to offer the commons
to make them go home?

21:11.567 --> 21:18.222
Huh... His Grace does not
go into details, but...

21:18.223 --> 21:21.225
to allay Your Majesty's fears,
he writes, in his own hand:

21:21.226 --> 21:24.228
"I beseech Your Majesty to take
in good part whatever promises

21:24.229 --> 21:26.581
"I shall make to these rebels,

21:26.582 --> 21:30.585
for surely I shall
never keep any of them."

22:02.868 --> 22:06.020
Alas, you unhappy men.

22:06.021 --> 22:09.724
What fancy, what folly
has led and seduced you

22:09.725 --> 22:13.277
to make this most shameful
rebellion against our most noble

22:13.278 --> 22:16.147
and righteous king and sovereign?

22:26.141 --> 22:28.159
Are you not ashamed?

22:28.160 --> 22:30.745
How can you do this,

22:30.746 --> 22:35.299
not only giving offence to
your natural sovereign Lord

22:35.300 --> 22:37.552
but giving us occasion
to fight with you,

22:37.553 --> 22:39.554
that have loved you more than
any other part of the realm,

22:39.555 --> 22:43.007
and have always taken
you for our best friends?

22:43.008 --> 22:48.162
Your Grace, we mean no
offence to His Majesty.

22:48.163 --> 22:53.918
But we have a petition which we
desire humbly to submit to him,

22:53.919 --> 22:57.922
for the restoration of many things

22:57.923 --> 23:00.675
which have gone amiss in this realm.

23:00.676 --> 23:03.327
We demand the restoration of our abbeys

23:03.328 --> 23:07.331
and our ancient rights.
- And a new Parliament

23:07.332 --> 23:10.585
be summoned to address the
people's sincere grievances.

23:16.942 --> 23:19.944
I can decide nothing here.

23:19.945 --> 23:25.149
But I propose a truce, during
which time two of your captains

23:25.150 --> 23:28.803
can take your petition and
present it to His Majesty.

23:28.804 --> 23:33.057
The truce to be maintained
until they return.

23:37.913 --> 23:40.865
My Lord Darcy, can we talk a moment?

23:57.833 --> 24:01.135
My Lord Darcy, you more
than anyone here has cause

24:01.136 --> 24:03.237
to be grateful to the
King for his bounty,

24:03.238 --> 24:05.890
for the trust he reposes in you

24:05.891 --> 24:10.745
and would like to repose in you still.

24:10.746 --> 24:13.397
And yet here I find you

24:13.398 --> 24:16.501
consorting with rebels and traitors.

24:16.502 --> 24:21.155
For my part I have been and
always will be true to the King

24:21.156 --> 24:25.710
our sovereign Lord, as I
was to his father before him.

24:25.711 --> 24:29.580
If you are as true and loyal as you say,

24:29.581 --> 24:32.867
then you can prove it
to us by giving over

24:32.868 --> 24:35.419
your Captain Mr. Aske into our hands.

24:35.420 --> 24:39.423
Sir, that I cannot and will
not do. For a man who promises

24:39.424 --> 24:43.127
to be true to someone then
betrays him may truly be called

24:43.128 --> 24:45.930
a traitor.

24:48.183 --> 24:51.052
His Majesty, the King!

24:53.889 --> 24:55.439
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

25:03.065 --> 25:04.899
Madam.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.552
Your Majesty.

25:07.553 --> 25:10.621
It makes me happy to
see you so much improved.

25:10.622 --> 25:12.657
I have a good physician.

25:12.658 --> 25:14.458
Nevertheless, I intend
we shall visit the shrine

25:14.459 --> 25:18.162
of Sir Thomas Becket
and give our thanks.

25:18.163 --> 25:21.415
I have arranged for
something else which I hope,

25:21.416 --> 25:23.718
with all my heart, will
make you very happy.

25:28.974 --> 25:31.342
Your Majesty, the Lady Mary Tudor.

25:45.157 --> 25:48.609
I ask Your Majesty for His blessing.

25:48.610 --> 25:50.745
My own daughter.

25:52.748 --> 25:56.751
May I present you to
Her Majesty Queen Jane?

25:59.104 --> 26:02.106
I remember, some of you were desirous

26:02.107 --> 26:03.875
that I should put this jewel to death!

26:13.118 --> 26:15.019
I've got you, your safe.

26:17.022 --> 26:19.023
Be of good cheer, Mary.

26:19.024 --> 26:22.376
For I swear nothing
now will go against you.

26:31.153 --> 26:33.070
Continue!

26:35.390 --> 26:38.492
- Are you happy?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

26:38.493 --> 26:42.046
His Majesty has agreed to give
you lodgings at Hampton Court

26:42.047 --> 26:44.048
and others at Greenwich Palace.

26:44.049 --> 26:47.401
I've seen them both; they're beautiful.

26:47.402 --> 26:52.306
I am very grateful to
His Majesty and to you.

26:54.309 --> 26:56.661
Everyone says my daughter is
innocent, that she doesn't know

26:56.662 --> 27:00.314
any unclean or foul speech.

27:00.315 --> 27:02.733
Do you believe that? Do you believe

27:02.734 --> 27:05.319
that anybody could be that innocent?

27:05.320 --> 27:08.623
Go and find out.

27:18.433 --> 27:20.001
Lady Mary.

27:23.005 --> 27:26.007
I wanted to apologize for my behavior.

27:26.008 --> 27:28.009
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

27:28.010 --> 27:30.127
I will try, Sir Francis.

27:30.128 --> 27:33.297
Jesus asks us to forgive everyone.

27:33.298 --> 27:36.651
- Do you like games, Lady Mary?
- Yes.

27:36.652 --> 27:38.853
There is a new game at
court that you might enjoy.

27:38.854 --> 27:40.454
What is it?

27:40.455 --> 27:44.308
It's called cunnilingus.
It's an old country practice.

27:44.309 --> 27:46.610
How do you play it?

27:46.611 --> 27:48.813
Well you...

27:48.814 --> 27:49.814
You...

27:52.718 --> 27:56.320
I think you're making
fun of me, Sir Francis.

28:08.500 --> 28:14.939
No! No le me tangere...
you can't touch me.

28:14.940 --> 28:18.009
For Caesar's I am.

28:32.524 --> 28:36.761
Your Majesty, Sir Ralph
Ellerker and Mr. John Constable.

29:16.001 --> 29:18.052
Gentlemen, I ask you this:

29:18.053 --> 29:21.572
what King has kept his subjects
so long in wealth and peace?

29:21.573 --> 29:25.459
So ministered justice
equally to high and low,

29:25.460 --> 29:29.463
and protected you from
all outward enemies?

29:31.466 --> 29:34.468
I have read your submission.

29:34.469 --> 29:36.837
Your first pretence is that
you seek to maintain the faith.

29:36.838 --> 29:39.173
But I tell you now gentlemen,

29:39.174 --> 29:41.425
that nothing is more
contrary to God's commandment

29:41.426 --> 29:45.980
than rebellion. Rising like
madmen against your prince,

29:45.981 --> 29:50.334
leaving lands untilled and
corn unsown is not the behavior

29:50.335 --> 29:53.838
of the proper commonwealth you claim to be!
- Your Majesty I feel compelled.

29:53.839 --> 29:56.941
Hush! You are before the King's Majesty.

29:56.942 --> 30:00.845
You make false claims about our
intentions towards the church.

30:00.846 --> 30:03.497
We have done nothing but
what the clergy in York

30:03.498 --> 30:06.500
and Canterbury agreed was in
accordance with God's holy word.

30:06.501 --> 30:09.236
God's holy word, gentlemen!

30:10.922 --> 30:14.375
So how can the simple
people say the contrary?

30:14.376 --> 30:17.278
What presumption and madness
is it of them to claim

30:17.279 --> 30:20.381
the knowledge of God's
law when they are ignorant

30:20.382 --> 30:23.934
and less knowledgeable and
should rather know their duty?

30:37.149 --> 30:39.049
You have seen before, in
Lincolnshire and elsewhere,

30:39.050 --> 30:40.818
how temperate and forgiving
is our inclination.

30:40.819 --> 30:44.071
Though rebellion is against God's will,

30:44.072 --> 30:46.307
I declare my intention through the pity

30:46.308 --> 30:49.410
and compassion of our
princely heart to pardon

30:49.411 --> 30:52.630
all of you who have transgressed,

30:52.631 --> 30:55.216
on condition that you
now lay down your arms.

30:55.217 --> 30:57.418
His Grace the Duke of Suffolk

30:57.419 --> 31:00.721
will come North again to Yorkshire
to moderate with you and make peace

31:00.722 --> 31:03.140
and see you disbanded.

31:03.141 --> 31:06.343
Good day, gentlemen.

31:27.866 --> 31:31.752
Your Grace?

31:31.753 --> 31:34.755
Your Grace should know
our army of pilgrims

31:34.756 --> 31:40.311
will not disperse just for
the promise of a pardon.

31:40.312 --> 31:44.715
Our pilgrimage is not over.
- I do know.

31:44.716 --> 31:48.269
And I have told the King.
That is why he has given me

31:48.270 --> 31:51.388
permission to negotiate with
you further in good faith.

31:51.389 --> 31:56.126
- On the basis of our petition?
- Yes.

31:56.127 --> 31:59.129
Does Your Grace have some
token of this "good faith"?

31:59.130 --> 32:01.131
You don't trust my word?

32:01.132 --> 32:06.036
Not for me, for our Captain
Mr. Aske. He's a lawyer.

32:06.037 --> 32:08.389
Here is a promise.

32:08.390 --> 32:10.391
in his Majesty's own hand,

32:10.392 --> 32:12.293
to deal with you openly,
fairly and reasonably,

32:12.294 --> 32:14.912
as his loving subjects.

32:19.401 --> 32:24.555
We are grateful and
bounden to His Majesty.

32:24.556 --> 32:27.558
Good night, gentlemen.

32:34.816 --> 32:37.167
This is for the Lancashire Herald.

32:37.168 --> 32:39.820
See that it is dispatched immediately.

33:14.706 --> 33:19.610
Mr. Constable... I beg
you, do not put your trust

33:19.611 --> 33:22.112
in Mr. Cromwell.

33:27.535 --> 33:31.538
I thank God and Your Majesty
for your great mercy today.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.976
I think you are the kindest of rulers,

33:35.977 --> 33:39.980
and I wish with all my
heart the world knew it.

33:39.981 --> 33:41.999
The world chooses what
it wants to know, Jane.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.885
But you can change its mind!

33:44.886 --> 33:47.237
I beg you to restore

33:47.238 --> 33:49.590
- and keep the abbeys.
- Jane...

33:49.591 --> 33:51.592
Think what the world will think.

33:51.593 --> 33:54.845
That you listened to your
people and to your heart.

33:54.846 --> 33:57.748
- Jane...
- I've told you once before:

33:57.749 --> 34:00.401
don't to meddle with my affairs.

34:04.406 --> 34:07.024
Do you remember what
happened to the late Queen?

34:08.909 --> 34:11.161
Yes...

34:11.161 --> 34:14.514
- I love you more than her.

34:14.516 --> 34:17.518
More even than Catherine.

34:21.172 --> 34:23.172
Don't spoil it.

34:42.944 --> 34:45.562
Cardinal Pole.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.199
My name is Diego Hurtado de Mendoza

34:50.201 --> 34:52.202
and these gentlemen are all advisers

34:52.203 --> 34:54.905
to His Imperial Majesty, King Charles V.

34:54.906 --> 34:58.208
Sirs, I carry this letter

34:58.209 --> 35:00.327
of legatine authority from
his Holiness Pope Paul.

35:00.328 --> 35:04.081
Shall we be seated?

35:10.472 --> 35:13.824
We were aware, Eminence, that
you were on your way here.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.826
But, forgive me, we remain

35:15.827 --> 35:18.829
a little unsure as to the
exact nature of your mission.

35:18.830 --> 35:20.481
I am sure you are aware

35:20.482 --> 35:23.484
of the risings which have
taken place across England

35:23.485 --> 35:26.837
against the King, that heretic
Cromwell and all his sect.

35:26.838 --> 35:28.489
We have heard

35:28.490 --> 35:32.860
some information, certainly.
And naturally we are intrigued.

35:34.746 --> 35:38.749
These popular risings
are the greatest chance

35:38.750 --> 35:41.502
that we may ever have to restore
the true religion to England,

35:41.503 --> 35:46.557
but the faithful people
of my country need support.

35:46.558 --> 35:54.264
Each of us, senor Mendoza,
in our own way must encourage

35:54.265 --> 35:57.217
the risings to continue
and to grow in strength.

36:01.973 --> 36:05.392
Even if that means the
overthrow of the King himself,

36:05.393 --> 36:08.695
not just his wicked council?

36:08.696 --> 36:09.897
Yes.

36:12.233 --> 36:15.786
We can imagine such
an outcome without fear

36:15.787 --> 36:18.789
for there is another,
close to the throne,

36:18.790 --> 36:21.141
with a legitimate
claim and a true faith:

36:21.142 --> 36:23.544
the Lady Mary.

36:25.797 --> 36:29.166
If not her,

36:29.167 --> 36:32.402
there is still another Catholic
with a legitimate claim.

36:32.403 --> 36:35.472
A scion of the Plantagenets,

36:35.473 --> 36:37.558
who ruled before the Tudors,
and would gladly rule after them.

36:37.559 --> 36:41.929
Of whom do you speak, Your Eminence?

36:44.816 --> 36:48.168
I speak of myself, senor Mendoza.

36:55.827 --> 36:57.361
Ralph...

36:57.362 --> 37:00.497
John! We have waited and
prayed for your safe return.

37:00.498 --> 37:04.251
Thank God! Thank God!
- The King in his mercy

37:04.252 --> 37:07.955
has offered us a general
pardon! He is also sending

37:07.956 --> 37:09.540
the Duke of Suffolk to
negotiate and treat with us,

37:09.541 --> 37:12.843
without preconditions and
on the basis of our demands.

37:15.947 --> 37:19.950
- Is it true?
- I trust the King's good faith

37:19.951 --> 37:21.602
and mercy and here's the proof of it.

37:21.603 --> 37:24.271
We are to meet again here.

37:31.062 --> 37:33.363
You have not said anything yet, John.

37:33.364 --> 37:36.717
Is it because you do
not agree with Sir Ralph?

37:36.718 --> 37:39.236
No, I cannot agree with him.

37:39.237 --> 37:41.872
How should I agree when I think

37:41.873 --> 37:43.874
that devil Cromwell has
such a hold over the King

37:43.875 --> 37:47.377
that I account these promises
to be utterly worthless!

37:47.378 --> 37:49.980
You don't think we
should meet with them?

37:49.981 --> 37:52.082
No, I don't. We should
expose their lies.

37:52.083 --> 37:55.986
Call a general muster,
take over all of the North

37:55.987 --> 37:58.755
and only then condescend to a meeting.

37:58.756 --> 38:02.593
Why are you so sure that their
word is not to be trusted?

38:02.594 --> 38:06.346
- Because of this.
- What's that?

38:06.347 --> 38:08.899
A copy of a letter from Cromwell

38:08.900 --> 38:11.018
to the Yorkshire gentry.

38:11.019 --> 38:14.021
I'll read some of it to you.

38:14.022 --> 38:17.274
"There is hope they
may disperse peacefully,

38:17.275 --> 38:21.778
"but if these rebels continue
with their illegal assemblies

38:21.779 --> 38:25.666
"and their defiance then
their rebellion will be crushed

38:25.667 --> 38:30.170
"so forcibly that their example
shall be fearful to all subjects

38:30.171 --> 38:34.041
so long as the world does endure."

38:36.878 --> 38:40.597
"So long as the world
does endure", gentlemen.

38:43.051 --> 38:46.286
But the truth is they cannot crush us.

38:46.287 --> 38:48.639
And that is why the Duke
is forced to negotiate.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.442
This sure sign of their deviousness
does not impress you then?

38:56.864 --> 38:59.800
I say we do not stop our vigilance.

38:59.801 --> 39:03.453
But prepare for our meeting,
clarify our positions

39:03.454 --> 39:06.456
and strengthen our arguments and have

39:06.457 --> 39:08.375
our Church leaders endorse them.

39:13.164 --> 39:17.417
Why should we fear, John,
when we are about God's work?

39:17.418 --> 39:19.970
I know we are but...

39:24.976 --> 39:29.680
I only hope that none of
us - nor our grandchildren -

39:29.681 --> 39:32.833
ever live to regret this moment.

39:32.834 --> 39:35.836
I wanted to wish you every
success for your journey

39:35.837 --> 39:40.490
and conference with the rebels.
- I am grateful to Your Majesty.

39:40.491 --> 39:43.844
You know I desire more than
anything else a peaceful remedy.

39:43.845 --> 39:46.196
You have my permission to
prolong the truce for as long

39:46.197 --> 39:49.499
as necessary. You may also
affirm my general pardon

39:49.500 --> 39:52.352
to all the rebels. Except their leaders.

39:52.353 --> 39:54.871
I want them brought to you still,

39:54.872 --> 39:57.457
with halters around their necks!

40:02.764 --> 40:08.385
Your Majesty knows the rebels,
no doubt unjustly, blame

40:08.386 --> 40:11.071
Master Cromwell for
many of their actions.

40:11.072 --> 40:14.891
Repeatedly they ask for
his removal and punishment.

40:14.892 --> 40:17.144
What should I tell them?

40:31.893 --> 40:33.994
You know what this is, Charles?

40:33.995 --> 40:38.799
Fruit from the New
World. New things come in.

40:38.800 --> 40:45.505
Everything changes. I have
a great appetite for novelty.

40:45.506 --> 40:48.558
Tell them what you like.

41:03.574 --> 41:06.676
Gentlemen, I have
read your new petition.

41:06.677 --> 41:09.029
Among other articles,
you ask for the setting up

41:09.030 --> 41:11.448
of a special convocation or Parliament

41:11.449 --> 41:13.683
to debate without fear

41:13.684 --> 41:16.953
or his Majesty's displeasure
questions of heresy,

41:16.954 --> 41:21.041
the royal supremacy, and
maintenance of the faith.

41:21.042 --> 41:24.945
I can tell you now that the King has
graciously conceded to your request.

41:24.946 --> 41:28.698
A special parliament

41:28.699 --> 41:33.470
will be summoned to be held
not far away at Westminster

41:33.471 --> 41:38.358
but here in York, to debate and
decide on all these questions.

41:38.359 --> 41:45.966
Thank you. We have asked for the
heresies of Luther, Wycliffe and Tyndale

41:45.967 --> 41:48.318
to be annulled and destroyed.

41:48.319 --> 41:51.872
We have asked that the heretics,

41:51.873 --> 41:54.074
bishops and temporal, be punished.

41:54.075 --> 41:57.744
That Cromwell, Audley, Sir Richard Rich

41:57.745 --> 42:01.882
be punished as subverters of
the good laws of this realm

42:01.883 --> 42:04.751
and maintainers of false sects.

42:04.752 --> 42:08.338
That is not for me to decide

42:08.339 --> 42:12.993
whatever my true feelings.
But such questions are exactly

42:12.994 --> 42:16.646
what the special Parliament
will be constituted to decide.

42:16.647 --> 42:19.399
Is it possible that this
Parliament can also debate

42:19.400 --> 42:22.402
the question of papal obedience,
touching the cure of souls,

42:22.403 --> 42:24.404
and the legitimacy of the Lady Mary?

42:24.405 --> 42:26.156
Yes, Mr. Aske.

42:26.157 --> 42:28.508
I can guarantee that all
these great matters can be put

42:28.509 --> 42:32.112
before the Parliament
without fear or favor.

42:32.113 --> 42:34.664
And the King is still willing
to offer a general pardon?

42:34.665 --> 42:39.019
Yes. I say that with hesitation.

42:39.020 --> 42:42.672
The more His Majesty understands
the causes of this uprising,

42:42.673 --> 42:46.126
and the loyalty of the
pilgrims to his person and rule,

42:46.127 --> 42:48.678
the more is he persuaded
to show clemency.

42:50.681 --> 42:54.684
- There is one other great
matter. Your Grace knows

42:54.685 --> 43:00.290
that we demand that the suppressed
abbeys should stand or be restored.

43:00.291 --> 43:02.559
This is our sticking point.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.795
We were always determined
to fight and die

43:05.796 --> 43:08.648
for the maintenance of
our religious houses.

43:08.649 --> 43:10.550
What I can say about that is that

43:10.551 --> 43:12.819
all further destruction
of the abbeys will cease

43:12.820 --> 43:15.305
until Parliament meets.

43:15.306 --> 43:18.558
It will then be up to
Parliament to decide if and when

43:18.559 --> 43:21.711
the others will be restored.

43:21.712 --> 43:26.716
Go home and put aside your arms.

43:26.717 --> 43:31.721
By standing together
and by standing strong,

43:31.722 --> 43:35.725
I believe we have achieved as
much as we could have gained

43:35.726 --> 43:39.579
when we first took up this
great pilgrimage of ours.

43:39.580 --> 43:44.484
It is almost Christmas. Go
home and celebrate the birth

43:44.485 --> 43:47.087
of our Lord Jesus Christ

43:47.088 --> 43:52.108
We thank God as we
thank the King's Majesty

43:52.109 --> 43:56.112
that all this has been
achieved without bloodshed.

43:56.113 --> 44:01.001
Please listen to the King's herald.

44:06.107 --> 44:10.260
"His Gracious Majesty King Henry VIII

44:10.261 --> 44:14.180
"hereby pardons by royal
command all those subjects

44:14.181 --> 44:19.769
who have transgressed and
risen in unlawful rebellion."

44:19.770 --> 44:22.372
I therefore ask everyone of you

44:22.373 --> 44:28.278
to disperse, go home
and put aside your arms.

44:28.279 --> 44:33.633
Firm in the knowledge that
our faith is to be maintained

44:33.634 --> 44:36.569
and not destroyed!

44:50.751 --> 44:52.802
- What is it, husband?
- I believe it's from the King.

45:03.164 --> 45:05.181
What does it say?

45:05.182 --> 45:07.067
Father?!

45:09.270 --> 45:13.823
"My trusty and well-beloved
Aske. I am informed that,

45:13.824 --> 45:16.693
"notwithstanding your
offences committed against us

45:16.694 --> 45:18.928
"in the late rebellion
attempted in those parts,

45:18.929 --> 45:21.281
"you are now at heart repentant.

45:21.282 --> 45:24.184
"And since you are determined
to be a faithful subject,

45:24.185 --> 45:28.538
we have conceived a great
desire to speak with you..."

45:28.539 --> 45:33.393
- Father!
- Hush, children, hush! Listen to your father..

45:33.394 --> 45:37.347
"... and to hear from your mouth the whole
circumstance and beginning of that matter."

45:37.348 --> 45:39.599
The King wants to speak
with me. Can you believe it?

45:39.600 --> 45:43.186
"I therefore order you, as
our true and faithful subject,

45:43.187 --> 45:47.157
"as we now repute you, to come
to court for Christmastide.

45:47.158 --> 45:49.726
"You are not to let anyone know,
but you will use such plainness

45:49.727 --> 45:52.979
"and frankness in all things
we shall demand of you,

45:52.980 --> 45:55.732
that we may have cause to
reward you even further."

45:55.733 --> 45:59.069
There is a credence attached saying

45:59.070 --> 46:02.038
that "You shall safe come
and safe go from court,

46:02.039 --> 46:04.541
returning before the
twelfth day of Christmas."

46:04.542 --> 46:09.215
Just make sure that he
means to honor the promises

46:09.747 --> 46:11.331
Lord Suffolk made on his behalf.

46:11.332 --> 46:13.333
Is it not obvious that the
King has taken this matter

46:13.334 --> 46:15.135
to his heart? This is a
letter written in his own hand.

46:15.136 --> 46:17.754
- You are still too trusting.
- I would not go now.

46:17.755 --> 46:20.990
But there is a promise of safe return.

46:20.991 --> 46:24.644
- Promises can be broken.
- Mr. Constable, the promises

46:24.645 --> 46:27.347
of a King are worth a great
deal more than the promises

46:27.348 --> 46:29.999
- of ordinary folk.
- Here's what we shall do:

46:30.000 --> 46:33.653
I will arrange to lay post
horses all the way between here

46:33.654 --> 46:37.657
and London, so that if
God forbid, Mr. Aske,

46:37.658 --> 46:42.112
you were imprisoned or
otherwise badly treated,

46:42.113 --> 46:43.903
I will hear about it straight away,

46:44.315 --> 46:46.961
and raise the people
again for your deliverance.

46:48.499 --> 46:50.014
Thank you Lord, that's it.
