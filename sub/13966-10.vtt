04:33.905 --> 04:36.032
On this day we gather

04:36.115 --> 04:39.743
all princes of the blood
and chieftains of the hordes,

04:39.828 --> 04:43.331
and all descendants of Lord Genghis Khan.

04:43.915 --> 04:49.087
We pray to the Blue Sky
and seek blessings for the decision

04:49.170 --> 04:51.714
that will be made this day.

04:51.798 --> 04:55.634
Bless the sacred spirit banner
of Lord Genghis

04:55.718 --> 04:59.680
that stands before
the white banners of peace.

04:59.763 --> 05:02.600
- The white banners of peace?
- Watch over us, Tengri...

05:02.683 --> 05:04.352
You've taken a piss on peace.

05:05.269 --> 05:09.816
Bring out the black banners, I say.
The war banners. Finish what you started.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.525
You're disrespecting the proceedings.

05:11.609 --> 05:14.612
You've disgraced these proceedings
with your acts of war.

05:14.695 --> 05:17.198
...Khan of all Khans.

05:17.281 --> 05:20.576
Thus we begin the Kurultai.

05:26.582 --> 05:29.127
It's a shame Nayan couldn't be here.

05:32.046 --> 05:34.465
I'm very sorry about your brother.

05:38.052 --> 05:41.430
It was you who snatched
your father from our camp.

05:45.643 --> 05:47.853
Why sneak off to the hills?

05:47.937 --> 05:49.981
Why not take your father back to the Khan?

05:54.318 --> 05:56.195
I'd be delivering him to death.

05:59.532 --> 06:01.910
The most significant day
in the Khan's life...

06:02.535 --> 06:05.329
and the only son by his side
is the pale flower.

06:06.205 --> 06:08.041
Where could the others be?

06:12.378 --> 06:14.838
Archers are stationed at every parapet.

06:14.923 --> 06:17.133
No one in and no one out.

06:17.216 --> 06:19.802
- As ordered.
- Excellent, Sukh.

06:22.388 --> 06:23.431
Kneel before me.

06:35.359 --> 06:39.072
In light of your dedication to service
in these times of great unrest,

06:39.155 --> 06:43.367
and by the powers bestowed
upon me by the Khan of Khans,

06:43.451 --> 06:46.495
as Vice Regent and Left Chancellor,

06:46.579 --> 06:50.583
I confer upon you the title of Orlok.

06:54.378 --> 06:57.256
You will command the Khan's generals
and their armies.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.674
Hurrah!

07:03.887 --> 07:05.098
Dismiss your men.

07:10.937 --> 07:12.688
Return to your posts.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.566
Vice Regent...

07:20.404 --> 07:22.281
You were given an order, General.

07:22.365 --> 07:24.575
This is highly unusual.

07:24.658 --> 07:26.285
Hold your tongue.

07:26.369 --> 07:30.498
A non-Mongol installing
a non-Mongol as Orlok...

07:31.249 --> 07:32.833
it's so unusual.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.461
It's unprecedented.

07:36.087 --> 07:38.714
Sukh...

07:38.797 --> 07:40.216
sheathe your blade.

07:53.354 --> 07:54.688
General...

07:55.564 --> 07:57.233
what is your name?

07:59.318 --> 08:00.486
Kasar.

08:03.322 --> 08:04.490
Kasar.

08:04.573 --> 08:06.993
General Kasar is clearly unnerved

08:07.076 --> 08:10.454
at these highly unusual times
we find ourselves living in.

08:18.004 --> 08:20.631
I am not unnerved.

08:20.714 --> 08:21.924
I am skeptical.

08:24.635 --> 08:27.138
Sukh is correct to draw his weapon.

08:27.221 --> 08:31.309
Under typical circumstances,
such skepticism would lose you your head.

08:33.644 --> 08:35.895
As you pointed out,

08:35.979 --> 08:39.025
these aren't typical circumstances,
Vice Regent.

08:39.107 --> 08:41.485
So you can appreciate my concern.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.323
Of course.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.742
What can I do to alleviate
your misgivings?

08:49.827 --> 08:51.870
Show us the Khan's orders.

08:54.748 --> 09:00.213
Return to your post, defend your position,
and I will produce the orders promptly.

09:00.296 --> 09:02.298
Will that appease you, Kasar?

09:29.533 --> 09:32.620
- Move back.
- I request to petition the Vice Regent.

09:32.703 --> 09:34.247
Move back.

09:39.585 --> 09:41.379
Open the gates. Now!

09:46.175 --> 09:48.552
Stay back!
Move back!

09:52.556 --> 09:54.057
Move back!

10:02.316 --> 10:03.609
Drink.

10:05.361 --> 10:06.445
What is it?

10:06.529 --> 10:07.905
Water.

10:21.877 --> 10:23.212
Thank you.

10:26.465 --> 10:29.177
There's honor in seeing it through.

10:29.260 --> 10:33.472
And when they count the votes,
and none have been cast for me...

10:34.848 --> 10:36.600
where is the honor in that?

10:39.102 --> 10:42.315
If all the votes were for you, Father,

10:42.398 --> 10:43.857
what then?

10:44.817 --> 10:46.444
Would that bring Orus back?

10:58.664 --> 11:00.499
May I be of service, Sire?

11:07.798 --> 11:09.717
Inclusivity.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.303
That's their assault against me.

11:13.887 --> 11:16.181
Number one in their complaints.

11:17.558 --> 11:20.185
If you wish to be
of service to me, Latin...

11:20.978 --> 11:22.438
make yourself disappear.

11:41.457 --> 11:44.752
He's rubbing my son's defeat in his face.

11:46.044 --> 11:48.171
His defeat?

11:48.256 --> 11:49.923
I thought this was your house.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.514
This is your defeat, your fault.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.516
You're to blame for all of it.

11:58.599 --> 12:02.311
I'm fully to blame, and wear it proudly.

12:02.395 --> 12:04.605
Did the sky of the wolf ever speak to you,

12:04.688 --> 12:07.983
or was it always Ahmad
whispering in your ear?

12:08.066 --> 12:09.277
If it weren't for the Arab,

12:09.360 --> 12:13.447
I never would've forced your father
to challenge Kublai in the first place.

12:16.158 --> 12:18.411
You were never going to fight fair.

12:20.371 --> 12:21.789
From the beginning.

12:22.498 --> 12:24.500
Why start a fight you can't win?

12:24.583 --> 12:26.460
Because Orus is dead...

12:27.044 --> 12:28.754
and father, destroyed.

12:29.505 --> 12:31.048
Because of you.

12:42.435 --> 12:45.604
Your body will settle in time.

12:45.688 --> 12:48.607
It will relax,
and then the milk will flow.

12:49.858 --> 12:51.360
Too late for that.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.654
Every woman is different.

12:58.116 --> 13:00.077
We're beyond lies, Mother.

13:00.786 --> 13:03.038
My body speaks.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.874
It says I am not a mother.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.751
It says for all to hear.

13:07.835 --> 13:10.963
Any swollen sow can feed your children.

13:12.297 --> 13:13.966
You must raise them.

13:14.049 --> 13:17.970
You must nurture their minds
to grow into a Khan and a Queen

13:18.053 --> 13:19.805
of unassailable character.

13:23.892 --> 13:24.935
Go, Mother.

13:26.269 --> 13:27.646
To your Khan.

13:29.147 --> 13:31.359
He needs you now more than I.

13:33.151 --> 13:35.654
It will be entirely for nothing
if he doesn't win.

13:45.956 --> 13:47.500
They need you.

13:49.251 --> 13:52.129
They are yours, Kokachin.
Your flesh and blood.

13:52.796 --> 13:54.798
It could never be for nothing.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.314
<i>I am here.</i>

14:12.566 --> 14:13.984
Do you see me?

14:15.653 --> 14:19.698
I was challenged to this Kurultai,
and I have come.

14:22.200 --> 14:26.622
I have traveled far,
in good honor and faith...

14:27.498 --> 14:31.460
but I was met by rebellion and war.

14:33.671 --> 14:38.551
"An action committed in anger
is an action doomed to failure."

14:39.552 --> 14:42.304
So said our grandfather, Genghis Khan.

14:55.568 --> 14:56.860
We are nomads.

14:59.071 --> 15:03.576
Have we not gall in our livers?
Fire in our blood?

15:04.702 --> 15:08.581
When our people, and our land...

15:09.665 --> 15:12.585
and our way of life are threatened...

15:12.668 --> 15:15.128
we are not afraid to incite war.

15:22.511 --> 15:26.474
"If my body dies, let my body die.

15:27.516 --> 15:30.436
But do not let Mongolia die."

15:30.519 --> 15:33.230
I wondered whether we should speak again.

15:33.313 --> 15:36.191
And the Blue Sky
has not grown thick with ice.

15:36.274 --> 15:38.569
- So said Genghis Khan.
- As last you predicted.

15:42.948 --> 15:46.076
"Victory does not come
to he who lives by the rules.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.872
It comes to he who makes the rules...

15:51.039 --> 15:53.542
he who imposes the rules on his enemies."

15:54.126 --> 15:57.630
So said the one born
with a blood clot in his fist,

15:57.713 --> 16:01.800
one with fire in his eyes,
light on his face!

16:01.884 --> 16:05.012
He, born of the blue wolf and red deer.

16:05.804 --> 16:08.807
Ancestors of the nomads.

16:14.647 --> 16:17.065
Kaidu speaks of a way of life.

16:17.733 --> 16:22.445
He speaks of nomads
as if I've surrendered my blood.

16:23.781 --> 16:26.033
Did I not ride here on a horse?

16:27.618 --> 16:31.163
"Conquering the world
on horseback is easy.

16:31.246 --> 16:35.083
It's dismounting
and governing that is hard."

16:35.167 --> 16:37.920
So said Genghis Khan
in the Year of the Ram.

16:39.838 --> 16:42.465
Your son does not seem to know
when he has lost.

16:42.550 --> 16:44.342
- ...is less an art...
- A family trait.

16:44.426 --> 16:46.887
- ...than conquering a man.
- And your husband is fat.

16:46.970 --> 16:48.931
Also a family trait.

16:49.014 --> 16:53.018
Conquering a man is no match
to conquering oneself.

16:53.727 --> 16:57.731
Did not Genghis say,
"Find me a man who abstains from drink,

16:57.815 --> 17:01.401
and that is the man
who will lead my armies"?

17:02.402 --> 17:03.486
So said Genghis.

17:05.113 --> 17:08.200
But did not Genghis also say,

17:08.282 --> 17:11.704
"Be of one mind and one faith"?

17:12.954 --> 17:15.332
I have seen with my own eyes

17:15.415 --> 17:19.127
that every faith has a temple
in the city of the Khan.

17:19.211 --> 17:23.298
Down there, in China,
the word is "capitulation."

17:23.381 --> 17:25.508
No, Kaidu, the word is "jealousy."

17:26.218 --> 17:27.970
From our own relations.

17:28.053 --> 17:29.930
From inside our golden family.

17:30.013 --> 17:32.766
We were destined.
We were chosen.

17:32.850 --> 17:36.061
You were pushed aside, forgotten.

17:36.144 --> 17:39.982
And you are common.
Your blood is not royal.

17:40.065 --> 17:42.943
A thousand stolen elections
cannot change that.

17:43.026 --> 17:45.613
...by the fangs of a black snake,
let us not be bitten.

17:45.696 --> 17:50.367
And yet, my son will be Khan,
and his son after him.

17:50.450 --> 17:52.578
Let us always trust one another.

17:52.661 --> 17:57.791
My bloodline is certain,
and yours will end this night.

17:57.875 --> 18:01.419
I say this, not just as Mongols,

18:01.503 --> 18:05.298
but as people under the Mongol Empire!

18:07.926 --> 18:11.096
Open the gates to outsiders,
secrets will spill!

18:42.377 --> 18:43.420
Brother.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.312
I should've left you there
to bleed out in that cave.

19:00.979 --> 19:02.981
Probably...

19:03.065 --> 19:04.399
but you didn't.

19:14.201 --> 19:15.577
Where are they?

19:16.870 --> 19:19.915
Which of the Khan's toys have come for me?

19:19.998 --> 19:21.124
Marco?

19:22.250 --> 19:23.460
Byamba?

19:24.795 --> 19:26.088
Hundred Eyes?

19:26.964 --> 19:29.675
Any? All?

19:33.095 --> 19:35.097
Send search parties into the slums.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.141
Find his co-conspirators
and bring them to me.

19:38.225 --> 19:39.559
You want me to leave you alone...

19:40.560 --> 19:41.770
with him?

19:46.358 --> 19:47.943
He's not going to kill me.

19:49.194 --> 19:51.947
He's going to try and compel me
to surrender.

20:36.241 --> 20:39.077
Spread out! Find them!

20:39.912 --> 20:41.955
They're looking for us.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.581
Let's go!

20:43.665 --> 20:45.458
Your turn, monk.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.044
Search the village!

20:48.045 --> 20:49.838
Look at their faces!

21:31.129 --> 21:32.339
Stand aside.

21:34.299 --> 21:36.301
I said stand aside.

21:36.384 --> 21:39.012
Do not chide them for following my orders.

21:42.515 --> 21:44.101
You should not be here.

21:45.477 --> 21:49.689
Not if you care for her
as she does for you.

21:50.732 --> 21:53.693
It's true... what she told me?

21:54.277 --> 21:55.403
Don't lie.

21:57.572 --> 21:58.656
Why?

21:58.740 --> 22:02.327
Because this is some
youthful moment of portent for you?

22:02.410 --> 22:04.621
This is my life.

22:04.704 --> 22:06.789
You did a terrible thing.

22:06.874 --> 22:11.044
And now let me welcome you
into the fellowship of almost all of us.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.134
I betrayed my father for the Khan.

22:18.385 --> 22:22.555
And Kublai is ignorant... at best...

22:22.639 --> 22:26.809
when it comes to acknowledging
the sacrifices of those in his service.

22:26.894 --> 22:28.311
But I am not.

22:29.646 --> 22:30.688
Go home.

22:30.772 --> 22:31.899
Home?

22:33.108 --> 22:36.569
You forget, my Empress, I cannot leave.

22:36.653 --> 22:40.240
- My Khan would not let me.
- You cannot help who you are.

22:40.323 --> 22:45.412
He will hold you close until he realizes
that who you are can only hurt him.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.414
You do not want to be here
when that day comes.

22:48.790 --> 22:51.418
In the morning,
when the Khan is looking for you,

22:51.501 --> 22:54.504
I will ensure our scouts
report you rode east.

22:57.340 --> 23:01.886
I will protect your secret...
so long as you protect mine.

23:18.361 --> 23:20.238
Will you tell her I said goodbye?

23:40.008 --> 23:42.469
While your father is alive...

23:42.552 --> 23:44.929
make as many friends as you can...

23:45.013 --> 23:47.224
see as many lands as you can.

23:48.850 --> 23:52.729
Do you remember these words?
Do you remember?

24:04.907 --> 24:07.119
The games are done.

24:07.202 --> 24:10.747
The drink and dinner consumed.

24:10.830 --> 24:13.541
There are no prayers left to pray.

24:22.050 --> 24:25.137
I have been given the honor
of asking one question of each of you

24:25.220 --> 24:28.140
on behalf of these noble chieftains.

24:28.223 --> 24:29.891
Lord Kaidu...

24:29.974 --> 24:32.769
you claim to want no allegiances
with outside forces,

24:32.852 --> 24:35.480
yet you mustered an army
with the Christians

24:35.563 --> 24:39.484
and conspired with the Vice Regent
to overthrow your Khan.

24:40.610 --> 24:44.364
And now this same Vice Regent
occupies and locks down

24:44.447 --> 24:47.325
the capital city of our great empire.

24:49.494 --> 24:50.537
I did.

24:51.829 --> 24:53.706
Has anyone heard a question?

24:58.878 --> 25:03.258
These are facts. Undisputed.

25:06.344 --> 25:07.929
This is the question.

25:09.222 --> 25:13.810
Amongst this treachery, did you hide
behind the banner of Kublai Khan

25:13.893 --> 25:15.770
and slaughter my people beneath it?

25:19.649 --> 25:21.359
Everything I've done...

25:23.236 --> 25:25.822
was to secure the Khanate,

25:25.905 --> 25:29.367
in order to protect ourselves
from his wayward vision.

25:29.451 --> 25:31.286
Answer the question.

25:35.082 --> 25:38.000
One that you know in your hearts
to be blurred.

25:38.085 --> 25:39.794
Answer.

25:39.877 --> 25:45.467
The Vice Regent has not
taken over our capital... our home.

25:46.218 --> 25:51.556
The birthright we leave our children
is not out there as Kublai claims.

25:52.807 --> 25:55.185
It is here on this soil.

25:55.810 --> 25:59.522
Beneath the Blue Sky,
where we stand together this day!

25:59.606 --> 26:02.775
Answer... the question.

26:20.585 --> 26:21.753
I did.

26:37.977 --> 26:39.854
Lord Kublai...

26:39.937 --> 26:41.981
you will remain the Khan of Khans.

26:44.359 --> 26:47.445
When elected, what will you do with him?

26:54.702 --> 26:57.164
I will take Kaidu...

26:57.747 --> 26:59.291
and all of his kin...

27:00.875 --> 27:05.547
and every sympathizer
who remains in the House of Ögödei...

27:06.964 --> 27:08.925
and I will bury them here...

27:10.343 --> 27:12.262
in his beloved dirt.

27:48.798 --> 27:52.176
So this is how the blind monk
passed through walls?

27:56.055 --> 27:58.391
Every legend must come to an end.

28:13.656 --> 28:14.907
Put your weapons down.

28:17.827 --> 28:19.246
We don't want to hurt you or your men.

28:19.329 --> 28:21.664
Put them down or I take them from you.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.000
You are serving a traitor.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.587
I am serving the Vice Regent, monk,
at my Khan's orders.

28:27.670 --> 28:29.964
And my father sent us to stop him.

28:30.047 --> 28:33.092
Neither of you holds any authority.

28:33.175 --> 28:37.054
Put your weapons down, and I'll bring you
to the Prince and the Vice Regent.

28:37.138 --> 28:38.848
We traveled with the Prince.

28:39.891 --> 28:43.395
He gave himself up
so that we could gain entry unseen.

28:43.478 --> 28:44.521
He's a prisoner.

28:45.146 --> 28:47.315
You think it's coincidence we're here?

28:48.190 --> 28:50.360
He's my brother.
Does that mean nothing?

28:51.653 --> 28:53.488
Kaidu or the Khan.

28:54.531 --> 28:56.699
I don't know who you serve, bastard.

28:56.783 --> 29:00.578
And the monk?
Do you question his loyalty to our Khan?

29:10.004 --> 29:11.839
You know it, in your heart.

29:15.468 --> 29:18.555
My heart knows nothing
but duty to the empire.

29:23.142 --> 29:24.686
Take their weapons.

30:54.191 --> 30:57.404
I have in my hand a letter
that could save this family.

30:59.364 --> 31:01.533
A missive from Ahmad.

31:02.617 --> 31:04.452
No doubt intended for you.

31:05.370 --> 31:06.413
Well...

31:07.372 --> 31:09.666
you certainly have my attention now.

31:10.583 --> 31:14.336
If father reads this to the chieftains,
it may be just enough.

31:14.421 --> 31:16.297
Enough to what?

31:17.549 --> 31:19.341
To destroy the Khan.

31:21.803 --> 31:23.888
The Arab saved us again.

31:25.264 --> 31:26.933
He does...

31:27.016 --> 31:28.393
or he doesn't.

31:30.437 --> 31:32.772
You wish to burn our salvation?

31:32.855 --> 31:35.525
I wish the lying and deceit to end.

31:36.568 --> 31:38.277
Which will not happen.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.363
If Kublai's reign of terror
is allowed to continue,

31:41.448 --> 31:43.866
there'll be more lies and more deceit,

31:43.950 --> 31:45.785
until we drown in a melting pot

31:45.868 --> 31:50.415
of backbiting outsiders
and malfeasance of all kinds.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.502
No good can come
from so much pain and anguish.

31:57.004 --> 31:59.090
I made him do it, you know?

31:59.173 --> 32:00.341
What?

32:01.258 --> 32:02.677
Your father.

32:02.760 --> 32:06.681
I made him cut you out of her,
cut you from your mother.

32:09.559 --> 32:14.313
And your father never wanted you to know
he killed her to save you.

32:15.732 --> 32:18.234
Will you be a good thing for him?

32:18.317 --> 32:21.488
Or was all that pain
and anguish for nothing?

32:23.990 --> 32:28.410
The future of the House of Ögödei,
of our family...

32:28.495 --> 32:29.912
is yours.

32:34.542 --> 32:36.503
Burn it...

32:36.586 --> 32:38.004
or don't.

32:38.505 --> 32:40.757
It's entirely up to you.

32:56.397 --> 33:00.109
Do you expect the army to defend you
when faced with their Khan's return?

33:00.192 --> 33:02.987
If he returns,
he will no longer be the Khan.

33:03.863 --> 33:07.241
Did your scouts not report
our victory at the twin rivers?

33:08.618 --> 33:10.036
They did.

33:11.078 --> 33:14.040
And how do you reconcile that reality
with your fantasy?

33:15.374 --> 33:18.503
How do you reconcile
I was able to maneuver undetected

33:18.586 --> 33:19.962
all these years?

33:21.506 --> 33:26.177
Do you truly believe I don't have
a plan in place should Kublai win?

33:28.805 --> 33:31.307
Look where I sit
and where you stand.

33:33.309 --> 33:34.602
Ahmad...

33:36.312 --> 33:38.439
there is time for you to stop this.

33:40.817 --> 33:43.611
Come with me,
tell father you were manipulated...

33:43.695 --> 33:45.947
I was manipulated by no one.

33:46.948 --> 33:47.990
Ever.

33:48.741 --> 33:50.451
But that can be the truth.

33:50.535 --> 33:53.037
It is the word of traitors
over the word of his son.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.956
I don't want that to be the truth.

33:55.873 --> 33:57.458
Don't you understand?

33:57.542 --> 34:01.671
I want the record to state,
unequivocally...

34:02.672 --> 34:06.008
that a boy ripped from his parents...

34:07.343 --> 34:09.887
from his miserly birthright, rose up...

34:10.888 --> 34:15.351
and quietly laid waste to
the most powerful man in all of history.

34:15.434 --> 34:20.607
Which would make me
the most powerful man in all of history.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.775
And do not fool yourself.

34:23.860 --> 34:27.154
This... This is not a parley.

34:29.114 --> 34:31.784
There are no terms for my surrender.

34:34.996 --> 34:37.373
And you, my brother...

34:37.456 --> 34:39.458
will not be leaving here alive.

34:44.088 --> 34:46.924
You summon me, hmm?

34:51.344 --> 34:53.806
Before I lay them down to sleep at night,

34:53.889 --> 34:57.393
I tell my children
stories of our ancestors.

34:58.060 --> 34:59.812
Stories of war...

35:01.272 --> 35:02.732
of treason...

35:04.609 --> 35:05.943
of honor.

35:06.527 --> 35:09.530
These stories were lessons to be imparted,
warnings heeded.

35:09.614 --> 35:11.658
A map of how to live and how to lead.

35:13.492 --> 35:15.494
The story of Börte was a favorite.

35:17.413 --> 35:19.832
The first wife and first mother of Khans.

35:19.916 --> 35:21.333
How she married Temüjin,

35:21.417 --> 35:24.211
the man who would one day
reign as Genghis Khan.

35:24.295 --> 35:27.506
How she was abducted by the three Merkits
in the middle of the night.

35:29.175 --> 35:31.886
How she watched as her husband
appeared to abandon her

35:31.969 --> 35:33.680
as he fled into the woods.

35:33.763 --> 35:38.142
How that husband hunted her down,
fought for her freedom

35:38.225 --> 35:41.520
and slaughtered to win her back
eight months later.

35:42.563 --> 35:44.481
Eight months.

35:46.651 --> 35:52.031
And she returned to Temüjin's house,
pregnant with their first child.

35:54.241 --> 35:57.619
Is the point of these stories
to put me to sleep?

35:59.706 --> 36:01.290
The whispers began.

36:01.916 --> 36:05.211
Whispers that not even
the mighty Genghis could silence.

36:05.294 --> 36:09.048
Whispers that the child
could not possibly be their own.

36:09.131 --> 36:12.009
Whispers that would destroy
that boy's chances

36:12.093 --> 36:14.303
of rising to the throne in his own right.

36:17.181 --> 36:19.726
For all the blood spilling...

36:19.809 --> 36:21.728
all the backstabbing...

36:22.937 --> 36:24.646
all the deal-making...

36:27.108 --> 36:30.611
Whispers can subvert it all.

36:33.781 --> 36:37.326
My daughter received this dispatch
from your Vice Regent

36:37.409 --> 36:40.537
concerning Princess Kokachin
and your heirs to the House of Tolui.

36:40.621 --> 36:42.248
Should I read it to you?

36:45.626 --> 36:48.212
Better I let the Empress
explain it to you.

36:52.466 --> 36:56.012
You have until the sound of the horn
for the start of the vote.

36:56.095 --> 36:59.724
If the people of Mongolia have not
received your abdication of the throne,

36:59.807 --> 37:04.645
I will walk into the pavilion...
and whisper it for all to hear.

37:06.563 --> 37:09.650
What fucking madness
has infected your head?

37:18.910 --> 37:20.912
You can protect your throne...

37:22.413 --> 37:24.456
or you can protect your family.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.211
It's your choice.

38:23.975 --> 38:25.392
Kokachin.

38:32.942 --> 38:36.028
You've come to say goodbye.

38:40.407 --> 38:42.034
Why did you tell me?

38:46.455 --> 38:48.875
- It should have been you.
- No.

38:48.958 --> 38:51.460
Babies with eyes color of the sea.

38:51.543 --> 38:54.213
No.

38:55.589 --> 38:57.049
The Prince...

38:58.092 --> 39:00.386
Jingim has real affection
in his heart for you.

39:00.469 --> 39:02.554
Tell me you love me, Marco.

39:05.099 --> 39:07.184
Tell me you love Nergüi.

39:14.775 --> 39:16.027
Kokachin...

39:23.409 --> 39:25.286
Go now.

39:45.389 --> 39:46.723
I won.

39:47.934 --> 39:49.226
I did it.

39:50.644 --> 39:52.521
How you wanted me to.

39:56.025 --> 39:58.319
Begged, bartered...

39:58.402 --> 40:00.071
I played by the rules.

40:00.988 --> 40:03.699
And now I must go out there,
give it all away.

40:04.616 --> 40:07.536
Give it to him.
All because of you!

40:07.619 --> 40:09.914
We deny it.

40:11.457 --> 40:15.044
Four wives. Nothing to show for it
until just the right time!

40:17.379 --> 40:22.218
Tell me, whose son is it
that would ascend to my throne?

40:24.595 --> 40:25.887
Who?

40:34.855 --> 40:38.150
No one.

40:39.735 --> 40:41.903
It... was no one.

40:56.543 --> 41:00.464
I have destroyed our family.

41:42.839 --> 41:44.466
You did what was necessary.

41:44.550 --> 41:46.760
- No.
- Yes. Yes.

41:48.095 --> 41:49.846
You did the hard thing.

41:51.140 --> 41:52.766
For our family.

41:52.849 --> 41:54.726
And our kingdom.

41:54.810 --> 41:56.437
- I deserve your anger.
- No.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.397
- I deserve your blows.
- No, Chabi.

41:59.398 --> 42:01.275
No.

42:02.984 --> 42:05.321
You did it for me.

42:11.035 --> 42:12.953
I was wrong, my wife...

42:14.663 --> 42:16.873
to think I could be without you.

42:27.176 --> 42:28.760
And now...

42:30.054 --> 42:31.888
it's over.

42:45.111 --> 42:46.570
Who else knows?

42:47.946 --> 42:49.490
- Who else...
- Knows?

42:52.784 --> 42:54.703
- Kokachin...
- Uh-huh.

42:54.786 --> 42:56.622
Marco.

42:56.705 --> 42:57.748
Who?

42:57.831 --> 43:01.252
I sent him away to Venice,
where he belongs.

43:04.296 --> 43:06.340
With the secret that could destroy us all?

43:06.423 --> 43:07.883
It doesn't matter.

43:07.966 --> 43:11.928
Who will he tell?
Who will care in the West?

43:15.266 --> 43:17.101
No one else, hmm?

43:21.897 --> 43:23.315
Well...

43:25.234 --> 43:27.403
now Khutulun...

43:28.862 --> 43:29.988
Kaidu.

43:35.911 --> 43:37.078
Hmm.

44:02.479 --> 44:04.356
Wine from the silver tree.

44:07.484 --> 44:08.944
I hate that thing.

44:11.029 --> 44:13.073
It does stand out, doesn't it?

44:14.741 --> 44:18.036
Möngke always had... flair.

44:19.455 --> 44:21.957
That's one way
of describing your brother.

44:22.958 --> 44:24.125
Where's Khutulun?

44:28.672 --> 44:30.341
This is between you and me.

44:31.508 --> 44:33.927
Oh, well.

44:56.367 --> 44:59.620
I've always known,
or hoped to know,

44:59.703 --> 45:01.372
if I'm being forthright...

45:02.498 --> 45:05.959
that a price existed I could not pay

45:06.042 --> 45:08.962
to satisfy my attainment and influence.

45:10.506 --> 45:12.924
That price, it seems, is my son.

45:14.926 --> 45:17.763
He will not be bought and sold here today.

45:22.518 --> 45:24.144
So...

45:24.227 --> 45:26.647
how do I inform the public?

45:30.567 --> 45:32.152
You walk out there...

45:33.904 --> 45:37.699
and tell them that I am to be
the next Khan of Khans.

45:39.285 --> 45:40.786
And you make them believe it.

45:43.664 --> 45:44.915
Hmm.

45:52.589 --> 45:54.675
Leave. Do not return.

46:52.148 --> 46:54.025
To a peaceful transition.

47:12.753 --> 47:15.046
I didn't wanna win this way.

47:15.130 --> 47:16.339
Really?

47:17.340 --> 47:20.469
I was prepared to destroy you
right from the start.

47:21.887 --> 47:24.890
But I was led off that course
by those around me.

47:26.767 --> 47:29.603
Advice, I realize now...

47:29.686 --> 47:31.897
was warped and craven...

47:33.565 --> 47:36.652
and working for the other side.

47:36.735 --> 47:38.069
Your side.

47:41.072 --> 47:42.908
You won, Kaidu...

47:43.909 --> 47:45.744
the old-fashioned way.

47:46.745 --> 47:48.622
By any means necessary.

48:31.457 --> 48:32.666
Kokachin!

48:37.170 --> 48:38.630
I'm coming to you.

48:58.024 --> 48:59.526
Kokachin...

49:07.325 --> 49:10.411
I am sorry.

49:19.087 --> 49:21.715
It's all right...

49:21.798 --> 49:23.341
Mother.

50:55.601 --> 50:58.436
Prisoners for you, Vice Regent.

51:00.063 --> 51:01.732
Well done, General.

51:06.612 --> 51:08.363
You will be richly rewarded

51:08.446 --> 51:11.532
for your dedication to the Khan
and his cause.

51:14.202 --> 51:17.038
Sukh, take our prisoners to a cell.

51:27.132 --> 51:29.300
I can do it differently
from now on.

51:33.429 --> 51:35.598
I can do it differently, can't I?

51:41.604 --> 51:44.190
Tomorrow, the Khanate is yours.

51:46.526 --> 51:48.820
You can do it any way you please.

51:51.657 --> 51:52.949
Drink with me.

52:02.417 --> 52:04.627
You were prepared to destroy me...

52:06.838 --> 52:08.423
right from the start.

52:16.181 --> 52:18.349
Poison from the Goyo plant.

54:37.948 --> 54:39.449
We have to go.

54:41.576 --> 54:44.079
We have to go right now.

55:11.189 --> 55:13.024
You may want to hold on to that.

55:29.790 --> 55:31.709
I thought I'd never see you again.

55:31.792 --> 55:34.462
Thought or hoped?

55:34.545 --> 55:35.796
Thought.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.425
I hoped you'd return.

55:44.097 --> 55:45.473
I need you.

55:46.474 --> 55:48.268
You need me?

56:05.868 --> 56:08.329
Do you know
how concubines are trained?

56:09.580 --> 56:10.748
Tell me.

56:11.874 --> 56:13.209
Mirrors.

56:14.335 --> 56:15.628
Mirrors?

56:15.711 --> 56:18.339
They put you in a room of mirrors.

56:20.383 --> 56:21.759
For days...

56:22.677 --> 56:24.054
weeks.

56:24.679 --> 56:27.307
After a while, time stops making sense.

56:31.852 --> 56:33.063
Why mirrors?

56:34.897 --> 56:36.357
To practice emotions.

56:40.611 --> 56:42.072
Cheerful.

56:44.449 --> 56:45.533
Coy.

56:47.118 --> 56:48.494
Heartbroken.

56:49.870 --> 56:51.164
Lonesome.

56:53.749 --> 56:57.628
But there was one... emotion...

56:58.629 --> 57:01.382
we were taught never to display.

57:02.717 --> 57:04.094
Anger.

57:05.595 --> 57:10.225
Because no man...
wants a woman who threatens him.

57:11.851 --> 57:13.394
For survival...

57:14.520 --> 57:16.689
we learn to suppress it...

57:17.607 --> 57:19.859
to bide our time.

57:25.240 --> 57:27.325
I never would have loved you.

57:30.036 --> 57:32.747
But I would have supported you.

57:34.457 --> 57:36.001
Fought for you.

57:37.918 --> 57:40.588
Maybe even died in your service.

57:44.384 --> 57:47.428
It was a momentary lapse in judgment.

57:48.138 --> 57:52.683
Selling my daughter
was always part of your plan.

57:55.478 --> 57:57.730
Had I known it would end this way...

58:00.566 --> 58:03.361
I would've eviscerated her
in front of you, instead.

58:03.444 --> 58:06.864
Then I am glad it ends this way.

59:14.474 --> 59:17.352
I could have continued
to run with my daughter.

59:24.275 --> 59:26.361
You never would have found me.

59:27.237 --> 59:28.696
Where is she?

59:28.779 --> 59:32.117
Headed south...
with a protector.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.085
Never return.

59:45.213 --> 59:49.384
I'll escort the concubine to her daughter
and ensure she stays there.

59:54.097 --> 59:56.557
Once I've confirmed my father's victory,

59:56.641 --> 59:58.101
we meet here.

59:59.144 --> 01:00:00.520
At home.
