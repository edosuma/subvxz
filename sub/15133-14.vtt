it's a little strange for me.

Um, 'cause she's better?

37:29.008 --> 37:31.577
- Karen, I'm kidding.
- No, you're not.

- [Laughing]
- That's so rude.

37:33.913 --> 37:37.483
Hey, um,
did Jimmy talk to you?

37:37.517 --> 37:38.784
I told him not to.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.318
I thought it might

One minute, we were hanging out,
and then you were gone.

Derek, I don't think
right now...

I need to know.

The night
of my birthday...

38:53.260 --> 38:55.394
I know the only reason
you came to see me

38:55.429 --> 38:57.530
is because Karen
rejected you.

38:57.564 --> 38:59.031
Karen?
Wow, okay.

38:59.066 --> 39:02.168
Um, well, there's nothing
going on there.

39:03.903 --> 39:06.004

the whole of last night,

39:06.039 --> 39:09.641
and I slept on the couch

39:09.676 --> 39:13.079
because of you.

39:13.113 --> 39:15.581
I just came as a friend.
That's it.

39:15.615 --> 39:18.084
Don't walk away from me
because of Karen.

39:18.118 --> 39:21.653
It's not Karen.

39:21.688 --> 39:24.056
It's you.

39:24.091 --> 39:26.425
You'll always have
a Karen.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.962
It's just who you are.

39:29.996 --> 39:33.099
I know that now.

39:33.133 --> 39:35.367
You should too.

39:37.971 --> 39:40.906
- Two minutes.
- This was a great idea, Tom.

39:40.940 --> 39:44.943
You are definitely
not a monster.

39:44.978 --> 39:47.980
Not today, at least.

Jerry!

39:50.917 --> 39:52.485

it's a great story.

40:01.194 --> 40:02.428
So do I.

40:02.462 --> 40:06.132
And also, I was thinking
what a lovely gesture that was,

40:06.166 --> 40:08.167
putting the ad
in the paper.

40:08.201 --> 40:09.568
Thank you.

40:09.603 --> 40:12.804
You, thanking me?

40:12.839 --> 40:14.740
To what do I owe this?

40:14.774 --> 40:16.308
Well, the reminder
that life

40:16.343 --> 40:18.310
is shorter
than we think it is.

40:18.378 --> 40:20.479
Does this mean
we're friends again?

40:20.514 --> 40:22.648
[Scoffs] No.

40:22.682 --> 40:25.017
But you can be a friend
to <i>Bombshell...</i>

on the table.

no longer available.

to something else.

- To <i>Hit List.</i>

40:36.996 --> 40:38.564

at the end of the month.

40:42.869 --> 40:45.103
It's good we're not friends.

away from you
