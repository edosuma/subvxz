00:00.900 --> 00:02.201
Adult adam:
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:04.737
<i> This is what</i>
<i> gaming looked like.</i>

00:04.739 --> 00:08.974
<i> Just a fold-out board,</i>
<i> assorted plastic pieces,</i>

00:08.976 --> 00:11.310
<i> And a pop-o-matic bubble.</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:12.211
<i> The competition was fierce,</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:15.014
<i> And there were</i>
<i> no bigger rivals than</i>
<i> my brother and sister.</i>

00:15.016 --> 00:18.650
<i> Board games gave</i>
<i> them an outlet to</i>
<i> channel their anger.</i>

00:18.652 --> 00:19.485
Don't mess up!
(buzzer)

00:19.487 --> 00:23.355
Oh! Paging dr. Sucks
at operation.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.290
Come in,
dr. Sucks at operation.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.493
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, winning felt good.</i>

00:27.495 --> 00:27.893
F-1.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.597
<i> But the real prize was</i>
<i> gloating as you crushed</i>
<i> the loser's fragile spirit.</i>

00:31.599 --> 00:33.298
(quietly) you sank
my battleship.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.600
I can't hear you.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.801
You sank my battleship.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.736
Look at me in the eye
when you say it!

00:37.738 --> 00:39.138
Adult adam: <i> Erica had smarts</i>
<i> and strategy.</i>

00:39.140 --> 00:44.043
<i> Barry had trash talk</i>
<i> and a psychotic desire</i>
<i> to win no matter the game,</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:45.077
<i> Even girl talk.</i>

00:45.079 --> 00:46.412
"the last digit
of your phone number

00:46.414 --> 00:49.415
"indicates how many boys
you will kiss."

00:49.417 --> 00:51.450
Six! Yes!
Girl talk!

00:51.452 --> 00:53.052
Adult adam:
<i> They were worthy adversaries</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:55.354
<i> Until a new board game</i>
<i> changed everything.</i>

00:55.356 --> 00:59.391
Check it out!
It's called
trivial pursuit.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.461
Yes! A new game
to dominate.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.197
Okay.
"sports and leisure.

01:05.199 --> 01:09.301
"what team has won the most
stanley cup championships?"

01:09.303 --> 01:11.136
(scoffs)
montreal canadians.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.673
Swish, baby.
This game is too easy.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.909
"arts and literature.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.544
"whose autobiographical
masterpiece

01:18.546 --> 01:22.181
"was entitled
<i> long day's journey</i>
<i> into night?"</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:23.749
Pass!
Sports again.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.885
Not how it works, dummy.
My turn.

01:26.887 --> 01:33.125
"what sailor's disease
resulted from a deficiency
of vitamin c?"

01:33.127 --> 01:34.626
Mmm, scurvy?

01:34.628 --> 01:35.394
Correct!

01:35.396 --> 01:38.097
Looks like someone's
gonna be tough to beat.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.298
Adult adam:
<i> The game was simple.</i>

01:39.300 --> 01:41.633
<i> You either knew the answer</i>
<i> or you didn't,</i>

01:41.635 --> 01:42.434
<i> And barry didn't.</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:46.572
<i> For the first time ever,</i>
<i> the scales were tipped</i>
<i> firmly to erica.</i>

01:46.574 --> 01:48.073
(exhales sharply)

01:48.075 --> 01:49.374
Oh, this one's super easy.

01:49.376 --> 01:52.244
"who wrote <i> the diary</i>
<i> of anne frank?"</i>

01:52.246 --> 01:53.812
Uh...

01:53.814 --> 01:54.480
Uh...

01:54.482 --> 01:57.716
Seriously? It's called
<i> "the diary of anne frank."</i>

01:57.718 --> 02:01.086
Don't help me!
I know what the answer is!

02:01.521 --> 02:02.821
It's...

02:02.823 --> 02:04.490
It's...

02:04.958 --> 02:07.392
Ahhh! I hate this!

02:09.762 --> 02:12.064
Who's up for girl talk?

02:12.332 --> 02:13.499
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:13.501 --> 02:18.470
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:19.772 --> 02:20.706
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:20.708 --> 02:24.109
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:24.111 --> 02:27.513
Adult adam:
<i> It was November 12,</i>
<i> 1980 something.</i>

02:27.515 --> 02:28.280
<i> I was in gym class,</i>

02:28.282 --> 02:31.683
<i> And today's lesson to</i>
<i> nurture the young</i>
<i> blossoming athlete,</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:33.218
<i> Scooter ball.</i>

02:33.220 --> 02:33.919
<i> It was a lot like soccer</i>

02:33.921 --> 02:37.489
<i> Except with an 80% better</i>
<i> chance of injury.</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:38.724
Ahhh.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.391
My fingers!

02:39.393 --> 02:41.527
I'm so sorry!
He's hurt!

02:41.529 --> 02:42.227
Scoot it off!

02:42.229 --> 02:44.396
Adult adam:
<i> The overlord of this</i>
<i> insanity was mr. Mellor,</i>

02:44.398 --> 02:48.667
<i> A gung-ho ex-jock filled</i>
<i> with stupid sports cliches.</i>

02:48.669 --> 02:50.569
No pain, no gain!

02:50.571 --> 02:51.570
There is no "I" in team!

02:51.572 --> 02:53.906
Winners never quit!
Quitters never win!

02:53.908 --> 02:56.675
Adult adam:
<i> And some of his sayings</i>
<i> we just found confusing.</i>

02:56.677 --> 02:59.845
It is never okay
to put butter on a doughnut!

02:59.847 --> 03:01.480
Dance like
no one's watching!

03:01.482 --> 03:03.849
Love like
you've never been hurt!

03:03.851 --> 03:06.652
Don't trust your cousin on
a road trip with your wife.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.686
(whistle chirps)
all right!

03:07.688 --> 03:12.858
Think you guys are
ready for the apex
of rubber-ball-based sports.

03:13.993 --> 03:14.593
Dodgeball.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.761
(bell tolls)
adult adam:
<i> For kids like me,</i>

03:15.763 --> 03:19.531
<i> This was our waking</i>
<i> nightmare from which</i>
<i> there was no escape.</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:21.333
Grab a ball!

03:21.335 --> 03:24.036
Same teams.
On my whistle.

03:24.038 --> 03:24.703
This is bad.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.705
I want the <i> star wars</i> theme
played at my funeral.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.440
What are you guys doing?
Posing for a trophy?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.776
Let's go!
Adult adam:
<i> It wasn't pretty,</i>

03:30.778 --> 03:32.411
<i> But as much as dodgeball</i>
<i> hurt me,</i>

03:32.413 --> 03:34.746
<i> It hurt someone else</i>
<i> even more.</i>

03:34.748 --> 03:35.347
Oh!

03:35.349 --> 03:36.715
My schmoopies
are home.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.483
(kisses)
okay.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.751
(kisses) hmm.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.385
(exclaims) oh!

03:40.387 --> 03:42.821
Who did this to
your kissable face?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.957
Mom, please don't.
I'm fine.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.258
Who?
I want names.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.861
It's from dodgeball.
Mr. Mellor lives for it.
It's like his air.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.931
It's like a violation
of human rights.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.465
Here we go.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.201
Bevy, it's not
a rights violation.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.336
It's gym class.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.404
Well, I think
he's an animal.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.505
How much does it
hurt, schmoo?

04:00.507 --> 04:03.108
On a pain scale
from 1 to 10, how much?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.844
Um...
I'd say fi...

04:06.312 --> 04:07.913
Three...

04:08.648 --> 04:09.681
One? One.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.449
It should be zero.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.918
I also would have accepted
the word "nothing."

04:12.920 --> 04:14.686
I'm marching down there
first thing.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.254
Bevy, no.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.389
They don't need
your angry rants
on how to educate.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.391
Mom, please don't
make a thing of this.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.726
You got to let
teachers teach.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.427
I don't want to be
on his bad side.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.295
Don't worry about him.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.198
He doesn't want to be
on my bad side,

04:26.200 --> 04:28.567
'cause it's much badder.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.435
Adult adam:
<i> It really was.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:32.537
<i> My mom marched down</i>
<i> to school so often</i>
<i> that the teachers</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:35.407
<i> Could almost sense</i>
<i> she was coming.</i>

04:35.409 --> 04:36.942
(door opens)

04:37.343 --> 04:38.510
Whoop!

04:38.512 --> 04:40.412
(door closes)

04:40.613 --> 04:42.514
(keys jingling)

04:45.718 --> 04:50.355
Don't worry, cinoman.
Today's not your day.
I'm here for mellor.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.024
Third door on the left.

04:52.392 --> 04:52.991
Cute top.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.228
You want me
to cancel dodgeball,

04:56.230 --> 04:59.097
One of the seven pillars
of fitness?

04:59.099 --> 04:59.831
What are the other six?

04:59.833 --> 05:04.670
Look, canceling dodgeball
would be like
canceling science.

05:04.672 --> 05:08.173
Is that what you want?
A world with no science?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.642
Why do you hate nasa?
Why?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.978
I don't hate it.
They gave us tang.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.447
What I do hate
is dodgeball.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.682
Dodgeball
is an essential part

05:16.684 --> 05:19.017
Of strengthening
a young man's character,

05:19.019 --> 05:22.321
And nobody needs that
more than your son.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.955
(sternly)
how dare you?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.692
My son has the strength
and character

05:26.694 --> 05:28.493
Of three lou ferrignos!

05:28.495 --> 05:31.596
How dare you invoke
lou ferrigno?

05:31.598 --> 05:32.397
How dare you?

05:32.399 --> 05:35.600
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you push me around!

05:35.602 --> 05:36.802
I'm not scared of you.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.736
Well, you should be.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.538
I'd think twice about this
if I were you.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.074
No. I will not
think at all.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.609
If there's any more dodgeball
in this school,

05:44.611 --> 05:47.412
You will regret it.
Mark my words.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.214
I will mark no words.
Mark them!

05:49.216 --> 05:51.750
Adult adam: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was putting a stop to</i>
<i> the game she hated,</i>

05:51.752 --> 05:54.953
<i> Barry was ready to give</i>
<i> the game he sucked</i>
<i> at another try.</i>

05:54.955 --> 05:58.924
Oh, hello.
I did not see you
sitting there.

05:58.926 --> 05:59.758
We're not sitting.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.060
What you're doing
is called sitting.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.595
Potato, potato.

06:03.930 --> 06:04.796
Care for a rematch, erica?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.766
And crush your fragile
spirit again?

06:07.768 --> 06:08.600
Gladly.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.069
Um, I don't think I want
to be here for this.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.506
You shall witness
the battle, old man!

06:14.607 --> 06:15.841
I mean...

06:15.843 --> 06:17.576
I cherish
our time together.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.777
Please, sit.

06:18.779 --> 06:22.514
Ooh. Science and nature.
Challenging.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.350
"what animal does
a hippophobe fear?"

06:25.352 --> 06:26.518
Horses.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.186
The answer is horses.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.454
That's right.

06:29.456 --> 06:32.424
Yellow. Ooh.
History.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.093
"how many children
does queen elizabeth..."

06:35.095 --> 06:36.128
Four.

06:36.130 --> 06:36.661
(chuckles) wow.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.097
You sure seem to know a lot
of stuff all of a sudden.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.600
There's no reason
to be patronibing.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.168
Okay, next card.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.173
"what city was called
the paris of the south?"

06:48.175 --> 06:48.874
Maya angelou.

06:48.876 --> 06:52.077
That's the answer
on the card you wanted me
to choose, you knob.

06:52.079 --> 06:52.944
You're clearly cheating.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.648
How dare you?
I am a sportsman!

06:56.650 --> 06:58.483
You insult my honor!
Pops: Hey, bar,

06:58.485 --> 07:00.552
It's kind of
obvious you're cheating.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.121
I am not.
I simply memorized
the answers

07:03.123 --> 07:06.158
And put the cards
in a particular order
so I can win!

07:06.160 --> 07:08.059
That's cheating!
That's preparation!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.094
Preparation
for cheating.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.597
Don't blame me!
This game is impossible
and has no point!

07:12.599 --> 07:14.266
What's the point
of mouse trap?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.534
To boot a marble down
a flight of stairs

07:15.536 --> 07:18.437
Onto a slide
and into a bathtub,
which, in turn,

07:18.439 --> 07:19.971
Another balls falls onto
a see-saw,

07:19.973 --> 07:21.873
Back flipping an old man
into a kiddie pool,

07:21.875 --> 07:25.010
Causing a trap to fall
on a mouse! Duh!

07:25.012 --> 07:25.577
That he knows.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.246
Face it, this is one game
you can't win.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.281
Say I'm better than you.
Say it.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.984
Never! I will do
everything in my power
to learn knowledge.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.655
I will go to school,
and I will read books,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.223
And I will study art,

07:38.225 --> 07:39.558
And I will drink in life

07:39.560 --> 07:42.928
Just so I can beat you
at this board game!

07:43.129 --> 07:44.229
Oh!

07:44.231 --> 07:48.700
He should probably
do all that stuff
regardless.

07:48.868 --> 07:49.901
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:49.903 --> 07:52.337
Due to aggressive
parental interference,

07:52.339 --> 07:55.240
There's been a change
in the phys-ed curriculum.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.675
(indistinct conversations)

07:56.677 --> 07:58.677
What?
Could be any of our moms.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.377
Effective immediately,

07:59.379 --> 08:02.481
There will no longer
be dodgeball in my class.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.281
(sighs)
instead,

08:03.283 --> 08:06.618
We'll play an
all-new safer,
kinder game

08:06.620 --> 08:07.986
Called big baby ball.

08:07.988 --> 08:12.324
We'll choose teams
by counting off
ones and twos.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.092
Goldfarb, begin.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.594
One.
Everybody else is a two.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.063
Let's get the ones
on that side,

08:18.065 --> 08:19.698
Twos on the other.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.100
Mr. Mellor,
is it too late to switch
my number to two?

08:22.102 --> 08:25.537
Well, your mother
demanded that we play
something else,

08:25.539 --> 08:28.673
So you can let
her know that her voice
was heard today.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.576
Good luck
and cover your nards.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.282
Adult adam:
<i> I was in a tight spot,</i>

08:37.284 --> 08:42.220
<i> So I decided my only choice</i>
<i> was to fight my way out.</i>

08:42.222 --> 08:43.922
(whistle blows)

08:44.891 --> 08:47.526
Why?
I don't know!

08:49.495 --> 08:51.596
(grunts)
sorry.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.099
Beverly: I don't understand.
Mellor didn't cower?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.300
Why didn't he cower?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.968
It's on you, bev.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.538
The boy was singled out
because you mixed in.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.339
He's right, mom.
You made it worse.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.774
Why can't you
ever listen?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.975
You want to
protect the boy,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.578
And you always
end up making it
a million times worse.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.914
No, you're
completely right.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.249
I know it in my heart.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.553
Good. It's nice to finally
be on the same page.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.754
Definitely.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.455
What's with the coat?

09:18.090 --> 09:19.558
Are you marching down
to school again?

09:19.560 --> 09:22.994
I want to say no,
but that would be a lie.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.563
But I thought
we're on the same page.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.864
We are, and yet,
here I go.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.700
Just stop!
Just tell your body
to stop!

09:28.702 --> 09:33.772
I want to.
I really want to.
But I can't.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.241
I thought
we're on the same page!

09:36.243 --> 09:36.875
(door closes)

09:36.877 --> 09:41.279
And the next item
of business is scheduling
teacher conferences.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.814
(door opens)

09:43.616 --> 09:45.684
Blonde monster.
(man coughs)

09:45.686 --> 09:46.318
Nothing.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.853
Mrs. Goldberg,
this is a private meeting.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.822
Not anymore.
Got to go, people!

09:50.824 --> 09:53.124
Don't care where.
Just not here.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.460
Don't leave.
She looks really mad.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.629
I'm sorry, earl.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.034
Mr. Mellor is no longer with
william penn academy

10:03.036 --> 10:06.671
Due to a concern
raised by a parent...

10:07.073 --> 10:08.873
Who shall remain nameless.

10:10.309 --> 10:11.142
This one's tough to deny.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.278
Adult adam:
<i> Thanks to my mother,</i>
<i> I got out of dodgeball.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:16.982
<i> All it took</i>
<i> was ruining a man's life.</i>

10:19.785 --> 10:22.554
Oh. Hello, again.

10:22.556 --> 10:23.922
I did not see you
sitting there.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.358
Again,
you're the one sitting.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.192
Potato, tomato.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.493
Come sit.
I've been thinking.

10:28.495 --> 10:33.531
We've completely lost
track of what board games
are all about...

10:33.533 --> 10:34.232
Family fun.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.668
That's why I invented
a new gaming experience

10:36.670 --> 10:41.106
For the whole family
to enjoy. I call it...

10:41.207 --> 10:42.240
Barry-nopoly.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.943
"do a freestyle rap
as good as big tasty

10:44.945 --> 10:46.511
"or nun chuck better
than barry?"

10:46.513 --> 10:49.247
I've made sure it caters
to all our strengths.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.751
For you, trivia.
Physical challenges
for myself.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.487
And for pops,
frequent bathroom breaks.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.121
I like this game.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.257
You actually created
a board game that
only you can win.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.225
Do you realize
how sad that is?

11:00.227 --> 11:03.695
Does this mean you forfeit
and I'm reigning champion
forever?

11:03.697 --> 11:04.529
No. I'll play.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.398
And I'll literally beat you
at your own game.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.633
Let's do this!
What'll it be, pops?

11:08.635 --> 11:11.169
Rap or an elaborate
nun chuck routine?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.737
I have to go
to the bathroom.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.973
(bell dings)
40 bonus points
for pops!

11:14.975 --> 11:17.609
I really like this game.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.444
Okay, your turn.

11:19.812 --> 11:20.712
Ooh.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.947
"arm wrestle barry."

11:22.949 --> 11:23.915
Easy.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.383
You're so hosed.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.017
Am I, now?

11:26.019 --> 11:30.321
Have you ever heard of
a little sylvester stallone
arm-wrestling drama called,

11:30.323 --> 11:31.022
"over the top?"

11:31.024 --> 11:33.725
No.
Well, you're about to
live it.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.727
Go.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.362
Ha!

11:37.364 --> 11:40.699
Oh, no!
He's losing!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.333
Or is he?
Over the top!

11:42.335 --> 11:45.270
What are you doing?
Going over the top!

11:45.571 --> 11:47.439
What are you doing?
I'm going over the top!

11:47.441 --> 11:49.474
You can't go over the top!
I'm going over the top!

11:49.476 --> 11:51.509
I'm going over your top!
(grunts)

11:51.511 --> 11:54.879
Yes! Yes!
In your face!

11:54.881 --> 11:55.680
This game is rigged!

11:55.682 --> 11:58.049
It's your game,
and I still beat you!

11:58.051 --> 12:00.185
Say it.
I'm better than you
in every way.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.253
Fine!
You're better than me.

12:02.255 --> 12:06.925
You're smart and you're cool
and everyone likes you.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.526
And I'm nothing.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.195
Congrats.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.196
Adult adam:
<i> For the first time ever,</i>

12:11.198 --> 12:13.598
<i> Crushing barry didn't feel</i>
<i> like such a triumph.</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:18.303
<i> Meanwhile, my dad</i>
<i> stumbled upon another man</i>
<i> down on his luck,</i>

12:18.305 --> 12:20.438
<i> Coach mellor.</i>

12:20.873 --> 12:21.639
Oh, god.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.374
You need a curb
painted, hoss?

12:23.376 --> 12:24.242
Suggested donation $5.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.146
Yeah, actually,
I'm adam goldberg's
father.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.148
Oh.
So your wife is...

12:30.150 --> 12:31.616
Yeah,
blonde monster.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.451
Love her dearly.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.621
So, is this what
you're doing for money?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.356
For now.
Turns out there's
not a great demand

12:38.358 --> 12:41.559
For a phys-ed specialist
in the middle
of the school year.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.228
I don't mean to tell you
your business,

12:43.230 --> 12:46.264
But I don't think
that's the right address.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.799
It is not.
I lost my 3.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.268
You know, I know my
wife can get carried
away with things,

12:50.270 --> 12:55.073
And I just want to
let you know, I'm really
sorry about all this.

12:55.075 --> 12:55.573
Don't be.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.309
Your wife plays hard.
I respect a winner.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.379
She's a good woman
who does not know
the word "quit,"

13:01.381 --> 13:02.514
Although she does know
the word "fired."

13:02.516 --> 13:04.549
Can I give you
a ride somewhere?
Maybe a hot meal?

13:04.551 --> 13:07.752
That's very kind of you,
but I only got about
10 more blocks to go,

13:07.754 --> 13:10.321
And I got a fanny pack
full of turkey jerky, so...

13:10.323 --> 13:12.624
I told you,
I don't want the numbers!

13:12.626 --> 13:15.960
It's donation only!
Just pay what's fair!

13:16.929 --> 13:19.931
You know what?
He's getting the hose.
You better open up.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.933
Those are fresh numbers!

13:23.969 --> 13:25.637
Where's the three?

13:25.639 --> 13:26.271
I got to tell you,

13:26.273 --> 13:29.507
He's not the same guy
without the whistle
and the short-shorts.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.411
A guy like that belongs
in a gym yelling at kids.
It's in his blood.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.447
Look, I never intended
for mellor to get fired,

13:36.449 --> 13:39.150
But this is on him.
He singled out my boy.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.720
Okay, he was wrong,
but you took it too far.

13:42.722 --> 13:46.191
Now do the right thing
and put that loose cannon

13:46.193 --> 13:46.991
Back in charge of children.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.261
I go easy on one teacher,
then the rest won't fear me.

13:50.263 --> 13:54.499
Fine. You won't help
the poor bastard, I will.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.100
What's that
supposed to mean?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.670
Mr. G, I really appreciate
this opportunity.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.738
You got my word,
I will give you 110%.

14:00.740 --> 14:04.609
Call me murray.
110%, that is not necessary.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.579
On a good day, the best vic
gives me is what? 50%?

14:07.581 --> 14:10.481
(laughs) there he goes,
busting balls.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.549
It's what we do.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.952
No. What we do
is sell furniture.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.987
Bring it in.
"furniture" on three.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.991
Yeah, okay,
what vic and I do is
we sell the furniture,

14:19.993 --> 14:24.662
And what I need you to do
is to move the coffee table

14:24.664 --> 14:25.997
Over by the sofa set.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.066
Sir, yes, sir!
Time me.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.234
Whoa, whoa.
It's not a race.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.637
Take your time.
One, two, three.
(grunts)

14:32.639 --> 14:33.638
Oh, whoa.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.675
That's oak. That's heavy.
I thought it was pine.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.478
Excuse me, sir.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.180
Excuse me.
Woman:
Is this in stock?

14:42.182 --> 14:45.950
Yes, it is.
And you can have that
in your house today.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.453
I don't know.
It's kind of pricey.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.821
Tell you what.

14:49.823 --> 14:53.091
You pay cash,
I'll take off 5%.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.692
I'll just come back
another time.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.060
There is no other time.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.263
Clock's winding down.
Ball's in your hands.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.031
You gonna put
the ball in the hole,

15:00.033 --> 15:01.199
Or you gonna
go home a loser?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.668
I don't really understand
what's happening right now.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.371
He's new.
We're team players
in this store.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.672
We don't sell to anybody
who doesn't pass the ball.

15:07.674 --> 15:11.776
You keep
referencing a ball.
Is it the same ball?

15:11.778 --> 15:13.478
Let me make it simple.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.213
There's no "I" in team,
man.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.182
We only sell to winners,
so get the (bleep) out!

15:18.184 --> 15:20.318
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Ho, ho.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.719
I am sorry!

15:21.721 --> 15:23.354
What? (panting)

15:23.356 --> 15:24.756
Okay. We need to talk.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.058
Sure thing, boss.
What are you doing?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.527
Taking a knee.
Just take
an early lunch.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.162
You got it, boss.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.400
Mellor: Juice time.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.673
Mmm.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.076
So many bananas
and beets.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.145
(sniffs) ahh.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.314
Let's go.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.517
(grunts)

15:52.785 --> 15:53.251
Yeah!

15:53.253 --> 15:56.688
Finally got some energy!
Let's go!

15:57.523 --> 16:01.025
So, before, that was him
without energy?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.562
Adult adam: <i> After my dad's</i>
<i> horrible day at work,</i>

16:04.564 --> 16:08.099
<i> He had to face</i>
<i> an even worse night</i>
<i> at home.</i>

16:08.101 --> 16:11.936
Hey, could I, uh,
have some ranch dressing
for my salad?

16:11.938 --> 16:13.972
Oh, of course, honey.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.509
When.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.180
That's what you get
for hiring the enemy
to work in our store.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.214
Don't worry
about mellor.

16:23.216 --> 16:27.919
You're not gonna
see him. He's working
all the way across town.

16:28.020 --> 16:28.853
Hey, boss!

16:28.855 --> 16:32.156
Sorry to interrupt!
It's me, rick mellor!
I work for you!

16:32.158 --> 16:34.525
I can see
you're eating dinner.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.661
Oh, is that lamb?

16:36.762 --> 16:38.596
That looks like lamb.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.667
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be
out making deliveries.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.901
Yeah, well,
here's the thing.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.703
I decided to do
all this week's drop-offs
in one day.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.374
I told you, you can't load
that much furniture
on the truck at once.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.243
I thought you said that
because you believed
I couldn't do it!

16:52.245 --> 16:54.612
And I proved you wrong.
(chuckles)

16:54.614 --> 16:56.214
But I broke the truck.

16:56.216 --> 16:56.848
Fine. Where is it?

16:56.850 --> 16:59.517
It's a couple blocks down.
Address is 466.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.620
Although the actual address
is 366.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.088
Haven't been my best
this week.

17:04.090 --> 17:07.859
Balls!
He's come for me!
He's seeking vengeance!

17:07.861 --> 17:08.493
No vengeance. No.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.629
I just came to apologize
to your old man for
breaking his truck.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.797
But while
I got you here,

17:12.799 --> 17:16.401
I guess I owe you both
an apology myself.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.604
Mrs. G,
you're a strong woman,

17:19.606 --> 17:21.406
And I respect the hell
out of you.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.242
Do you? Do you?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.544
Thanks.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.612
And, adam,

17:27.614 --> 17:30.048
I was dead wrong
to single you out.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.016
The truth is,
I'm only hard on you

17:32.018 --> 17:33.217
'cause I'm rooting
for you.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.119
Really?
You know,
as you get older,

17:35.121 --> 17:37.555
You'll realize that
life ain't easy

17:37.557 --> 17:39.891
And things fly at you
that are a lot harder

17:39.893 --> 17:42.026
Than a stupid
red rubber ball.

17:42.028 --> 17:46.097
And I just want you
to learn that you're
strong enough to face it

17:46.099 --> 17:49.267
And there's nothing
you can't overcome.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.134
Adult adam:
<i> In that moment,</i>

17:50.136 --> 17:54.505
<i> I realized my biggest foe</i>
<i> was really my</i>
<i> biggest advocate.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:56.374
Well, enjoy your dinner.

17:56.376 --> 18:00.378
Wait. Are you hungry?
I could fix you a plate.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.746
A plate? Ha.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.782
Hell, just point me
to the blender.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.388
Oh, hello.
I did not see you
sitting there.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.355
I agree.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.190
So, I was thinking,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.159
How about one more game
of trivial pursuit,
winner takes all?

18:15.161 --> 18:18.596
So you can take all?
No, thanks.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.398
Okay, how about this?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.065
If you can beat me,

18:21.067 --> 18:24.469
Then trivial pursuit
is banned forever
from this house.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.937
Sounds awesome.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.639
The only problem is,
I can't win.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.909
"who had an encounter
with the three bears?"

18:32.644 --> 18:33.711
Goldilocks.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.812
That's right.
Game on!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.647
Adult adam:
<i> As fate would have it,</i>
<i> that game,</i>

18:36.649 --> 18:40.284
<i> Barry knew every question</i>
<i> my sister threw at him.</i>

18:40.286 --> 18:42.120
<i> It was as if he was suddenly</i>

18:42.122 --> 18:43.788
<i> The smartest man</i>
<i> on the planet.</i>

18:43.790 --> 18:46.691
<i> Or erica was picking cards</i>
<i> from the little kid's edition,</i>

18:46.693 --> 18:48.860
<i> Suggested ages</i>
<i> eight through 12.</i>

18:48.862 --> 18:50.962
Cookie monster! Pigeons!

18:50.964 --> 18:52.864
The number four. Trees.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.532
Purple. Turtles.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.133
That's the one.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.169
Barry: Clouds. Beanstalk.
Unicorn. Butterflies.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.005
Santa.
Can I get a full name
on that?

19:01.007 --> 19:02.807
Santa claus.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.610
Okay.
This one's for the win.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.214
"what has the
scientific formula h2o?"

19:10.382 --> 19:12.116
Water! It's water!

19:12.118 --> 19:15.486
I'm the smartest man alive!
Say I'm better than you.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.888
You're better than me.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.724
Yes! (exhaling sharply)

19:19.726 --> 19:21.259
Ugh. (grunts)

19:21.261 --> 19:22.059
Pops: Oh!

19:22.061 --> 19:25.163
I'm all right!
Yes!

19:25.165 --> 19:26.931
Way to go, kiddo.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.200
Yeah, well,
he needed the win.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.801
Adult adam:
<i> Sometimes the best way</i>

19:30.803 --> 19:31.736
<i> To get the win is to lose,</i>

19:31.738 --> 19:34.238
<i> And other times,</i>
<i> you just have to</i>
<i> admit defeat.</i>

19:34.240 --> 19:38.943
Well, I would consider
bringing mr. Mellor back

19:38.945 --> 19:40.478
On one condition.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.614
You don't step foot
in this school ever again.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.550
One year.
Deal.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.218
Adult adam: <i> My mom wasn't</i>
<i> many things,</i>

19:47.220 --> 19:49.086
<i> But she was a woman</i>
<i> of her word.</i>

19:49.088 --> 19:51.455
<i> That year,</i>
<i> she never went back</i>

19:51.457 --> 19:53.024
<i> To school to complain.</i>

19:53.026 --> 19:54.325
Yoo-hoo!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.526
Sorry to interrupt,
earl.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.628
But technically
this isn't school

19:57.630 --> 19:59.730
And I do have bones to pick.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.831
Oh, is that brisket?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.134
Adult adam: <i> Although winning</i>
<i> never came easy to me,</i>

20:03.136 --> 20:05.603
<i> Mr. Mellor actually did</i>
<i> end up teaching me</i>

20:05.605 --> 20:08.372
<i> How to duck anything</i>
<i> life might throw at me.</i>

20:08.374 --> 20:10.841
<i> ¶ victory is mine</i>

20:10.843 --> 20:12.510
<i> ¶ shooting at the walls</i>
<i> of heartache</i>

20:12.512 --> 20:15.313
<i> ¶ the warrior ¶</i>
(grunts)

20:23.155 --> 20:24.789
(bell dings)

20:25.324 --> 20:26.857
(bell dings)

20:28.560 --> 20:30.795
Okay.
You rolled a two.
Uh-huh.

20:30.797 --> 20:35.499
Now cruise down
the big tasty river
and draw a barry card.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.134
Oh. Your face
is on these.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.904
I love this game.
(chuckles)

20:39.906 --> 20:42.840
"roundhouse kick
better than barry."

20:42.842 --> 20:46.711
Better than my
kara-te master?
It can't be done.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.812
Right answer!

20:47.814 --> 20:49.013
Ooh!
50 points!

20:49.015 --> 20:50.648
(laughs)

20:51.483 --> 20:53.484
Challenge card.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.153
"arm wrestle barry."

20:56.255 --> 20:58.155
Oh, we get to hold hands.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.691
Oh, you're even turning
your hat backwards.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.460
How macho.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.929
Go!

21:05.063 --> 21:06.497
(grunting)

21:07.699 --> 21:08.799
Over the top!
Ow!

21:08.801 --> 21:10.768
That's how you do it!
Oh! Oh!

21:10.770 --> 21:12.403
Let's go! Let's go!

21:12.405 --> 21:14.572
Whoo!
You're so strong,
honey.

21:14.574 --> 21:18.109
(robotic voice)
I know I am so strong.

21:18.111 --> 21:18.709
Let's go, barry!

21:18.711 --> 21:20.711
Oh, I'm so proud
of you, honey,

21:20.713 --> 21:22.713
The way you beat mommy
like that.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.615
I'm the best!

21:24.617 --> 21:26.117
Let him win, huh?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.618
He needs it.
