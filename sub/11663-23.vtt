(serene music playing)

01:09.400 --> 01:11.133
Ma, what's wrong with you?

01:11.200 --> 01:14.500
You've been leaving
the toilet seat up all week.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.100
Thank God.
I thought I was losing weight.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.233
Oh, girls,
I have great news.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.800
I just talked to my daughter Janet.

01:23.867 --> 01:27.300
She and my granddaughter
Sarah are coming to visit.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.166
I've never been so happy.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.700
Janet? Isn't she the daughter
who hates you?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.967
Well, that didn't last long.

01:35.433 --> 01:36.600
She doesn't really hate me.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.700
We just don't see eye-to-eye.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.100
Now this is my big chance, girls.
You've got to help me.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.533
What is something the
three of us could do together?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.867
Well, we could
sneak into Rose's room

01:45.934 --> 01:48.200
put on some of her hayseed dresses
then do imitations of her--

01:48.266 --> 01:52.066
No, no, no, not the three of us.
I mean, Janet and Sarah and I.

01:52.133 --> 01:53.800
Oh, the three of you.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.500
I don't care.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.533
You're no help at all, Sophia.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.233
-Dorothy, do you have any ideas?
-My idea of a good time--

02:03.300 --> 02:05.333
Oh, God. I'm dead.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.533
I am so mad.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.000
I got a letter from home
all about my high school reunion.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.867
I didn't know
I'd miss such a good time.

02:15.934 --> 02:17.000
Listen to this.

02:17.066 --> 02:21.200
"Dear Rose,
you sure did miss a good time.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.800
The precision drill team
wasn't the same without you.

02:25.867 --> 02:28.066
We could only
spell out St. Oaf."

02:30.233 --> 02:33.033
Rose, you didn't get
to go to your reunion

02:33.100 --> 02:35.133
because you weren't feeling well.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.033
Maybe if you'd seen a doctor,
you could've gone.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.467
You don't understand.

02:39.533 --> 02:43.667
I'm from St. Olaf.
St. Olaf is farm country.

02:43.734 --> 02:47.200
We're rough and rugged.
We never see doctors. Never.

02:47.266 --> 02:51.266
In fact, my great-grandfather once
removed his neighbor's appendix,

02:51.333 --> 02:53.600
and he wasn't even sick.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.600
Why would he do that?

02:55.667 --> 02:59.734
They were playing poker
and the stakes got a little high.

03:01.266 --> 03:05.700
Rose, you've been looking pale.
You ought to see a doctor.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.533
Blanche's right. See a doctor.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.667
It's just indigestion,
and I'm tired from working hard.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.900
Rose, you're playing
with your health here.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.500
You're crazy.

03:16.567 --> 03:18.133
Oh, I'm crazy, am I?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.734
You think I'm crazy?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.367
Well, I'll tell you something else.

03:21.433 --> 03:24.934
In St. Olaf, we don't believe
in psychiatrists either.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.633
Ha-ha-ha!

03:31.867 --> 03:35.367
(mellow music playing)

03:35.867 --> 03:37.300
Good. You're all here.

03:37.367 --> 03:40.433
Saturday night.
Of course, you're all here.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.166
Listen to what I found
in the personals.

03:45.233 --> 03:50.400
"Last call for those who graduated
from east Miami high, class of '52.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.100
Don't miss our
40th reunion party."

03:53.166 --> 03:55.266
What's that have to do with us?

03:55.333 --> 03:58.967
You missed your reunion
because you didn't feel well.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.333
Here's your chance to go to one...

04:02.934 --> 04:05.934
and for Dorothy and me
to meet some men.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.133
Me too! Me too!

04:10.300 --> 04:12.967
Let's say you, Rose, and I do go.

04:13.033 --> 04:15.467
Won't they know we haven't
been to that school?

04:15.533 --> 04:17.667
Yeah. How do we stop
that from happening?

04:17.734 --> 04:20.500
These people went to
school 40 years ago.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.200
They won't know
each other anymore.

04:23.266 --> 04:25.467
We'll blend right in.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.967
We'll just blend right in. Smooth.

04:29.033 --> 04:32.967
I did feel bad about missing
my high school reunion,

04:33.033 --> 04:34.900
and Miles is out of town.

04:34.967 --> 04:37.166
With you guys there,
I'd have fun.

04:37.233 --> 04:41.767
This is ridiculous, but let's do it.
It'll be a lark.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.633
We'll be like the three musketeers.
All for one...

04:44.700 --> 04:45.834
And one for all.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.767
Wait a minute.
What about ma?

04:49.834 --> 04:50.967
Thank you, pussycat.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.900
We'll have to get a sitter.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.367
No more sitters.

04:56.433 --> 04:59.633
We're still in litigation
with the last one.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.333
She bit me first.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.667
You're gonna come with us
but you have to be prepared.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.333
Now, I'm gonna go by
the school library

05:08.400 --> 05:09.800
and pick up some old yearbooks.

05:09.867 --> 05:11.800
We have to know all the basics,
you know, like,

05:11.867 --> 05:13.800
oh, senior class president,

05:13.867 --> 05:17.867
quarterback of the football team,
class slut.

05:17.934 --> 05:20.467
Blanche, how do you tell a slut
from a yearbook?

05:20.533 --> 05:23.367
Oh, how do you tell a slut
from a yearbook?

05:25.233 --> 05:28.266
You don't have to buy
a yearbook dinner.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.333
Rose.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.333
You can take a yearbook
home to your parents.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.700
Rose.

05:34.767 --> 05:38.900
There's nothing wrong with having
a yearbook on the coffee table.

05:38.967 --> 05:41.500
Rose, this isn't a riddle.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.767
Well, make it one.
I had three good answers.

05:46.667 --> 05:51.567
(calm music playing)

05:51.633 --> 05:54.300
Well, I'm ready for the reunion.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.700
What do you think?

05:55.767 --> 05:58.934
I think you haven't changed
a bit since your prom.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.400
Really?

06:00.467 --> 06:03.900
No, I'm lying. Why do you
press me on these things?

06:05.066 --> 06:07.133
You're not spoiling this for me.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.633
Tonight I'll be the person
I want to be.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.100
No baggage. I am free.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.367
Nobody has to know that
I haven't fulfilled my dreams,

06:15.433 --> 06:18.133
or that I got pregnant
in high school,

06:18.200 --> 06:21.133
or that I stay home
on Saturday nights.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.867
Then what the hell am I
supposed to talk about?

06:25.133 --> 06:28.533
Rose, I just want to
make sure you're prepared.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.133
I studied that yearbook
as hard as you.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
Ask me anything.
Anything.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.133
Ok. What were the school colors?

06:36.633 --> 06:40.266
Brick and a kind of a cementy color
between the bricks.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.433
Rose, be serious.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.166
Ask me something else.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.567
How many fingers
did the shop teacher have?

06:50.633 --> 06:52.200
-Nine.
-That's too easy.

06:52.266 --> 06:55.166
All shop teachers have nine.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.967
Rose Nylund, you haven't memorized
anything, have you?

06:58.033 --> 07:00.767
You'll walk in there tonight
totally unprepared,

07:00.834 --> 07:02.800
and whatever you say
will be wrong,

07:02.867 --> 07:04.567
and we'll be kicked out.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.100
I'm feeling tired.
Maybe I shouldn't go.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.166
Wait. You're deliberately
trying to get out of going.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.867
I think I'm a little afraid.

07:12.934 --> 07:13.934
Afraid of what?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.600
Afraid of looking stupid.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.800
Oh!

07:18.800 --> 07:21.433
I think this whole thing is wrong.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.367
We're going to this reunion
and deceiving people

07:24.433 --> 07:26.567
and changing our past histories.

07:26.633 --> 07:29.767
To me,
that's almost like lying,

07:29.834 --> 07:32.200
and that's against
everything I am.

07:32.266 --> 07:35.133
Rose, what's the natural
color of your hair?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.600
I'll get the car.

07:41.600 --> 07:47.133
(serene music playing)

07:47.200 --> 07:48.066
Where have you been?

07:48.133 --> 07:52.400
I went by the no-show table
and got name tags.

07:52.467 --> 07:54.533
Blanche,
you'll be Susan Armstrong.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.033
Dorothy,
you'll be Cindy Lou Peoples.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.633
And Sophia, you're Myron Zucker.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.066
There's no way
I'm ever going to pass for a man.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.433
Dorothy, trade with me.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.433
Go to hell, Myron.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.967
I don't want to wear this.

08:17.033 --> 08:18.633
I looked in the yearbook.

08:18.700 --> 08:21.467
You're a dead ringer
for Cindy Lou Peoples.

08:21.533 --> 08:22.600
I don't know.

08:22.667 --> 08:26.667
Trust me. It'll work,
or my name isn't "Kim Fung-Toi".

08:29.800 --> 08:34.000
I'll stand with those women
so I'll be less conspicuous.

08:34.066 --> 08:35.000
Why do you say that?

08:35.066 --> 08:36.300
Well, Dorothy, you remember.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.900
The pretty girls
always travel in packs.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.934
Rose, you all right?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.633
I just feel faint.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.133
Getting together with my old friends
is starting to get to me.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.133
Rose, you don't
know anybody here.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.233
So the snubbing
isn't race-oriented?

08:59.300 --> 09:01.900
You know,
I really hate reunions.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.700
I mean, everybody
is so plastic and fake.

09:04.767 --> 09:07.166
Everybody pretending to
be something they're not.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.633
Why can't people
just be themselves?

09:10.734 --> 09:13.033
-"Cindy Lou Peoples"?
-"Tommy Lunt"?

09:13.100 --> 09:14.533
-Aah!
-Aah!

09:23.367 --> 09:25.900
Excuse me,
aren't you Mrs. Gonzales?

09:25.967 --> 09:27.433
Spanish 101?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.533
<i>Si.</i>

09:30.166 --> 09:32.700
Hi. Larry Tucker.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.700
I was always afraid to tell you this
when I was in your class,

09:35.767 --> 09:38.800
but I had a huge crush on you.

09:38.867 --> 09:41.133
Why didn't you ever
do anything about it?

09:41.200 --> 09:44.133
Mrs. Gonzales,
you were my teacher.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.567
And you were my favorite student,

09:46.633 --> 09:51.200
but I'm not your teacher any more,
and Mr. Gonzales is dead.

09:51.266 --> 09:52.000
Let's mambo.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.734
-Susan? Susan Armstrong?
-Ted. Ted O'Brien.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.066
My, my.
You would not believe

10:02.133 --> 10:05.100
how often I've thought about you
over the years.

10:05.166 --> 10:09.500
I remember our one date
when I told you I didn't like girls,

10:09.567 --> 10:11.133
and you told everyone.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.533
Everyone!

10:12.600 --> 10:13.834
Well, guess what?

10:13.900 --> 10:16.700
I still don't like girls,
and I don't like you.

10:16.767 --> 10:20.133
Ted. Ted!

10:20.200 --> 10:21.667
Oh, who cares?

10:22.834 --> 10:25.767
The most interesting thing
about the tar business,

10:25.834 --> 10:29.533
actually, I have to pick two things.
It's impossible to pick one.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.233
The two most interesting things
about the tar business are

10:33.300 --> 10:39.734
the tar itself and the number
of shoes you go through.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.667
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm probably boring you.

10:42.734 --> 10:45.333
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.967
So, where do you get your tar?

10:52.467 --> 10:56.200
I lost my first husband
in a tar pit. Excuse me.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.667
Well, if it isn't Susan Armstrong.

11:01.734 --> 11:05.867
Oh, and don't you
look handsome, Bill.

11:05.934 --> 11:09.367
Wow. You haven't aged a bit.
I've missed you.

11:09.433 --> 11:12.367
Really, Susan?
How about our baby?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.600
The one my parents raised?

11:16.667 --> 11:18.100
Do you ever miss him?

11:19.600 --> 11:23.300
You know, it isn't really good
to dwell on the past.

11:23.367 --> 11:26.767
So, what do you
do for a living?

11:26.834 --> 11:30.600
Bill? Bill! Oh, who cares?

11:32.700 --> 11:35.967
May I have your attention, please.
Let's get started.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.166
Cindy Lou Peoples?

11:39.233 --> 11:42.467
-You look incredible.
-Well, thank you.

11:42.533 --> 11:46.300
You remember our Korean
exchange student,

11:46.367 --> 11:47.867
Kim Fung-Toi.

11:47.934 --> 11:49.800
Oh, sure.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.433
You look... different.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.600
Different on outside,
same on inside.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.734
Hi, I'm Pete Fielder.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.500
Senior class president.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.600
Oh, my God, he's the president.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.800
-Rose...
-I'm gonna try something.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.433
Look, there's a Tar salesman.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.934
Oh, my God, it's a Tar salesman.

12:10.533 --> 12:12.767
Hello and welcome,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves,

12:12.834 --> 12:16.000
but it's now the moment
we've been waiting for.

12:16.066 --> 12:18.333
I'm tired of being Cindy Peoples.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.600
Her life is almost
as boring as mine.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.166
Let's go home, Dorothy.
Rose?

12:23.233 --> 12:25.934
And now the king and queen
of the prom,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.300
Danny Farrell
and Cindy Lou Peoples!

12:37.433 --> 12:39.033
I'm queen.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.600
I'm queen!

12:40.667 --> 12:41.667
Oh, Ma.

12:41.734 --> 12:44.367
Ma, I'm queen of the prom.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.166
I'm proud of you, Cindy Lou.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.700
I'm queen!

12:51.266 --> 12:53.800
This is sad.
This is so sad.

12:54.934 --> 12:57.066
Hold it.
You're not Cindy Lou Peoples.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.967
What are you
talking about?

12:59.033 --> 13:01.066
I brought my mother.
She'll vouch for me.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.533
That's Mrs. Gonzales.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.900
<i>Si.</i>

13:05.967 --> 13:07.266
They're both impostors.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.867
Run, Ma, run!

13:09.867 --> 13:11.367
Dorothy?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
-Rose?
-You see what you've done?

13:14.567 --> 13:16.800
You've upset Kim Fung-Toi.

13:18.266 --> 13:20.700
-Rose?
-Dorothy, she's not kidding.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.100
Oh, my God.
Somebody get help!

13:23.166 --> 13:24.834
Rose. Rose.

13:26.166 --> 13:29.200
(siren wails)

13:29.700 --> 13:31.533
Why won't they say how she is?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.133
Blanche, be patient.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.133
We've been here over an hour.
What if she's already dead,

13:37.200 --> 13:38.934
and they're trying to figure out
how to tell us?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.333
She is not dead.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.700
I remember when people
used to die at Shady Pines.

13:42.767 --> 13:45.266
I hated the way the nurses
used to break the news.

13:45.333 --> 13:50.600
"Guess who's getting two desserts
tonight," it was so transparent.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.166
Oh, my God, Dorothy, I just had
another horrible thought.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.233
What if Rose had a major stroke?

13:57.300 --> 14:00.800
What if she is left completely
unable to care for herself?

14:00.867 --> 14:02.533
What would we do?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.266
We would bring her home.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.800
That's what we would do.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.300
If she had a stroke,
we'd take care of her.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.467
She's family.

14:09.533 --> 14:11.266
Ahem.

14:12.734 --> 14:16.500
Right, and then
we'd send her to Shady Pines.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.233
Thank you.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.300
This is all my fault.

14:21.367 --> 14:22.633
What are you talking about?

14:22.700 --> 14:25.266
I knew she wasn't feeling well,

14:25.333 --> 14:27.900
yet I insisted
she go to that reunion.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.367
How can I be
so self-centered?

14:31.433 --> 14:33.133
All I'll ever think about is me.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.066
Me, me, me, me.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.800
Blanche, we all knew
she wasn't feeling well.

14:37.867 --> 14:40.600
Do you mind?
I'm talking about me.

14:41.734 --> 14:45.066
All we can do for Rose
is say a prayer.

14:45.133 --> 14:49.066
Been a long time since
I've said a prayer.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.834
I don't think God knows
who I am any more.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.467
God, Blanche.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.533
Blanche, God.
Go ahead.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.867
Dear God...

15:02.800 --> 15:07.533
it's been an awful long time
since I've done this, and I'm sorry.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.700
You have given me a lot
to be thankful for,

15:11.767 --> 15:16.834
my wonderful children,
my health, a beautiful body,

15:16.900 --> 15:19.033
legs to die for...

15:20.767 --> 15:25.533
a face that is stunningly sexy, and
yet has the innocence of a child,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.767
with luscious lips that defy--

15:27.834 --> 15:30.767
He knows what you
look like, Blanche.

15:30.834 --> 15:35.734
Yes, you know, and
I just wanted to say good job.

15:36.700 --> 15:40.533
Oh, but dear God,
I do have a favor to ask.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.967
Could you please spare
my friend Rose?

15:43.033 --> 15:46.467
I know I haven't been perfect,
but if you let her live,

15:46.533 --> 15:48.834
I'll try to be a better person.

15:48.900 --> 15:53.166
If in your infinite wisdom
you decide to...

15:54.200 --> 15:56.533
start the aging process on me...

15:59.800 --> 16:01.734
I will understand.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.900
And I promise...

16:04.734 --> 16:07.867
I will not have sex with anyone...

16:09.567 --> 16:12.266
unless they really, really need it.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.834
Amen.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.633
Hi. Are you waiting for news
on Rose Nylund?

16:19.700 --> 16:21.333
Yes, doctor. How is she?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.133
I've just seen her,
and she's fine.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.900
Thank God.
We were so worried.

16:26.967 --> 16:30.166
A very mild cardiac episode.
No permanent damage.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.700
You can see her
when we get her into a room.

16:33.767 --> 16:37.033
Did you hear that?
Rose is fine.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.834
My prayer was answered.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.467
Who knows?
Maybe that's what did it.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.734
I know I was doing some praying.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.567
All I know is Rose will be ok,

16:46.633 --> 16:48.433
and I'm going to
stick by my promise.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.600
You'll see a new, improved Blanche.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.967
I've talked to the nurse.

16:53.033 --> 16:56.300
Mrs. Nylund's in her room
and wants to see you.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.700
Room 114.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.400
By the way, I don't think
I caught your name.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.500
I'm Blanche.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.533
Blanche, can I see you
outside the hospital?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.600
Maybe we can
have dinner some night?

17:08.667 --> 17:11.967
Oh, well, do you really need to?

17:12.033 --> 17:15.433
I mean, do you really,
really need to?

17:16.967 --> 17:19.633
Well, I don't really need to.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.867
Then I'm sorry, but I can't.

17:25.967 --> 17:28.467
Oh, you are a vengeful God.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.400
(soft music playing)

17:33.467 --> 17:35.533
Oh, girls, thank God you're here.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.700
I'm sorry I scared you.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.467
The doctor wants me
to stay overnight for observation.

17:40.533 --> 17:44.133
Don't be sorry. We're just
so happy you're feeling better.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.333
She's right. Now, you just
take it easy, Rose.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.800
This scare really
touched all of us.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.667
I've been bargaining with God.

17:51.734 --> 17:55.166
I promised
him there'd be a lot less sex

17:55.233 --> 17:56.767
and a lot more church.

18:01.767 --> 18:06.767
I'm sorry. I thought you were
joking to raise my spirits.

18:06.834 --> 18:10.600
We all got a second chance.
I wasn't living up to my potential.

18:10.667 --> 18:14.300
I'm going to take an aptitude test.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.767
Maybe go to law school.

18:15.834 --> 18:19.233
Ma, come on.
You'll be 96 when you get out.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.967
I'll be 96 anyway.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.133
Well, since everyone
is making promises

18:25.200 --> 18:30.367
in celebration of Rose's
miraculous recovery,

18:30.433 --> 18:33.266
I've decided...
I'm going to go out more.

18:34.533 --> 18:37.367
She's going to be a lawyer,
and I can't go out?

18:39.100 --> 18:42.633
You know, I've never
been afraid of dying.

18:42.700 --> 18:46.000
That's 'cause
I'm not going to stay dead.

18:46.066 --> 18:48.000
I'm going to get frozen.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.233
I read a magazine article
on cryogenics.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.834
They freeze you, and
when they find a cure for you,

18:55.900 --> 18:57.367
they bring you back.

18:57.433 --> 19:00.033
There's no proof of that working.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.900
They've had great success
with the Arctic beetle.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.367
You have nothing in common
with beetles.

19:05.433 --> 19:08.100
Think that one through.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.166
Well,
I've heard it's really expensive.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.400
Not if you just do your head.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.967
What?
I want to preserve my brain.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.667
Oh. We're sorry.

19:27.734 --> 19:31.000
We thought you were joking
to raise our spirits.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.066
No. I want to get
my head frozen.

19:34.133 --> 19:37.633
I want you to promise
you'll help me with this.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.834
All right. If it'll make you happy,

19:39.900 --> 19:43.567
I'll see that your head
gets to the cryogenics people.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.600
Blanche will help me too.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.600
Well, I do have George's
old bowling ball bag.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.567
I need your solemn promises

19:53.633 --> 19:55.800
that you'll have
your heads frozen too.

19:55.867 --> 19:57.800
No, Rose. I don't think so.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.033
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.166
I thought we were friends,

20:02.233 --> 20:04.433
and friends do little things
for each other,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.567
like get their heads frozen.

20:07.066 --> 20:11.500
Ok, we'll be good friends
and have our heads frozen too.

20:14.567 --> 20:15.700
What?

20:15.767 --> 20:19.033
I was just thinking about what
Dorothy said about getting out more.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.567
-(mellow music playing)
-(doorbell rings)

20:27.000 --> 20:30.200
-Granny!
-Oh, sweetie pie! Janet.

20:30.266 --> 20:32.633
-How was the trip?
-Fine. Fine.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.467
Sit down next to grandma.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.000
Give me a hug. You, too.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.467
You're so beautiful.
You're so sweet.

20:40.533 --> 20:42.533
Can we go to monkey village?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.033
Yes, darling.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.166
We can go anywhere
and do anything you want

20:46.233 --> 20:47.934
on God's magnificent earth.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.367
You're sure in a good mood
for a Sunday morning.

20:51.433 --> 20:53.934
Uh-oh.
We can wait in the kitchen

20:54.000 --> 20:58.133
if you need time to say goodbye
to uncle whoever.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.734
No, no, nothing like that.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.367
I thought we could go
to church together,

21:03.433 --> 21:04.900
just like good people.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.967
You know how I feel
about organized religion.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.166
It makes me crazy.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.200
I don't want Sarah's head
filled with stories

21:10.266 --> 21:12.700
about a God who may not exist.

21:12.767 --> 21:15.066
Honey, of course, he exists.

21:15.133 --> 21:18.767
Just look at the beautiful sky,
the majestic trees.

21:18.834 --> 21:22.266
God created man
and gave him a heart and a mind

21:22.333 --> 21:25.633
and thighs that could crack walnuts.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.500
Mother...

21:27.567 --> 21:29.667
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:29.734 --> 21:32.100
I came to religion late.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.166
I'd say.

21:33.233 --> 21:35.100
But it's never too late.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.066
It's my fervent hope
that the three of us,

21:38.133 --> 21:40.533
you and I and dear little Sarah,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.800
may walk the path of
righteousness together.

21:43.867 --> 21:48.000
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have Gideon bibles for everyone.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.333
I miss sexy grandma.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.233
I'm sure a lot of people do.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.200
(soft music playing)

22:02.266 --> 22:05.934
Rose?

22:06.433 --> 22:08.133
Look at this.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.633
Vaseline...

22:11.834 --> 22:16.767
ben gay... ooh, wow, look at this
wonderful thermometer.

22:16.834 --> 22:20.033
Ouch! Stop me. I'm like
a kid in a candy store.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.600
Ma, don't take that stuff.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.934
They expect us to take it.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.166
It's like hotel soap.

22:27.266 --> 22:29.467
Oh, excuse me.
We're here to pick up our friend.

22:29.533 --> 22:32.633
Are they doing some tests first?

22:32.700 --> 22:34.200
Rose Nylund?

22:34.266 --> 22:38.333
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but she went into cardiac arrest.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.367
They're prepping her for surgery.

22:40.433 --> 22:43.133
Sur--

22:43.200 --> 22:45.734
(sad music playing)

22:52.600 --> 22:56.934
(theme music playing)
