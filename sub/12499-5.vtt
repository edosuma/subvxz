00:14.175 --> 00:16.576
- Man, we run this bitch.
- Yeah.

00:16.577 --> 00:20.147
And when you work with your best
friend, it's not even like work.

00:20.148 --> 00:23.383
I feel the same way, bro.
When working is hard work, I stop working.

00:23.384 --> 00:24.524
You know what we should do?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.821
Come up with a catchphrase, so we can say
it when we do something cool like that.

00:27.822 --> 00:30.991
It should be, like, a
combination of our names or...

00:30.992 --> 00:33.026
- Ste-Zel.
- That's it.

00:33.027 --> 00:34.494
How did you just come up with that?

00:34.495 --> 00:36.863
- I'm black.
- Man, you are cool.

00:36.864 --> 00:39.204
Help! Help!

00:39.533 --> 00:41.902
No, no, no, no! Please, no!

00:45.173 --> 00:48.081
Get out of here! Go on! What happened here?

00:48.082 --> 00:51.712
I was just minding my business when
this moose sexually assaulted me.

00:51.713 --> 00:54.708
I'm gonna report this to the
National Park service, congress.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.622
- I'll sue your... - [Makes moose call]

00:57.623 --> 00:59.920
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no. Not again, no.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.485
Now we're gonna ask you one more time.
What happened here?

01:02.486 --> 01:04.798
Nothing. Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

01:04.799 --> 01:05.826
And whose fault was it?

01:05.827 --> 01:07.476
It was mine. All my fault.

01:07.477 --> 01:09.192
You were asking for it, weren't you?

01:09.193 --> 01:11.020
Walking around dressed like a whore.

01:11.021 --> 01:12.566
- Ain't that right?
- Whatever you say.

01:12.567 --> 01:13.889
I should have never worn this outfit.

Woody hasn't used the siren in years.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.556
It's got to be something major.

01:37.557 --> 01:40.906
It better be. I was having a good dream.

The Secretary of the Interior is coming
for a surprise inspection today!

02:01.223 --> 02:04.139
Actually, it's not a surprise.
I put it on his calendar six months ago.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.927
Did you write "check calendar"
on the goddamn calendar?

02:06.928 --> 02:08.895
- Yes.
- Oh, you did, huh?

02:08.896 --> 02:12.121
Okay, we only got a few hours to
get this crap hole into shape

02:24.913 --> 02:26.972
Steve, I want you to start a forest fire.

02:26.973 --> 02:28.515
I'll do it without question, Sir.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.228
Quick question. Why am I doing this?

02:30.229 --> 02:33.750
Because, stupid, when I put
the fire out, I'll be a hero.

02:33.751 --> 02:35.023
I'll get a promotion.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.990

- Since when do you want a job?

02:45.681 --> 02:47.540
If this place shuts down, I don't get paid.

02:47.541 --> 02:49.319
I didn't want to tax you, Denzel.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.047
Just smile and try to be articulate.

02:51.048 --> 02:53.899
- What do you mean "articulate"?
- I'm sorry. Way over your head.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.500
It means well-spoken.

I know what it means, you ignorant bastard.

02:57.603 --> 03:00.605
I want something important to do.
I'll be in charge of starting that fire.

Okay, okay.
I'm sure you can do the job, Denzel.

03:03.910 --> 03:06.531

dinner in your footlocker?

Sir, I eat when I get nervous, Sir.

05:35.861 --> 05:38.397

I don't know what it's like to
be in your shoes. We okay now?

06:36.991 --> 06:39.924
- Yeah, we cool.
- Oh, and I got you this.

06:39.925 --> 06:43.061
It's a pimp cup. It seemed weird
that you didn't already have one.

- You did not just give me a pimp cup.
- What? You don't like it?

06:46.232 --> 06:50.297

Secretary of the Interior,

you'll see that the
mountains are still there.

- Feel free to count them.
- Hmm.

06:56.818 --> 06:59.077
Does that bear have a pilot's license?

06:59.078 --> 07:01.000
No, but don't worry.
I'm not as drunk as he is.

07:01.001 --> 07:02.571
Ooh, a fire.

07:02.572 --> 07:06.384
Can you believe the luck?
Hold onto your hat. This might be heroic.

07:10.089 --> 07:13.091
- That was the fuel dump button!
- Whoops.

07:13.092 --> 07:15.393
You think all black people
walk around with pimp cups?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.895
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- That's unfair!

07:17.896 --> 07:20.376
What have I ever done to make you
think I'm smarter than that?

07:20.377 --> 07:23.835
- [Sniffs] Wait, is that gas?
- You're right. Holy cow!

[Both screaming]

07:32.879 --> 07:34.979
Man. What happened?

07:34.980 --> 07:39.090
Just relax now. You've both suffered
fourth- and fifth-degree burns.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.266
You did very well in surgery,
but I'm afraid there

07:41.267 --> 07:44.081
was a teensy, tiny mistake
with the skin grafts.

07:44.082 --> 07:47.459
Mistake? Wait, wait, wait.
What kind of mistake?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.257
[Both screaming]

07:49.258 --> 07:51.657
I went ahead and took 3% off your bill.

Whenever you're ready.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.248
White? Why the hell am I white?

07:55.249 --> 07:58.234
Hey, honest mix-up.
You were both burnt to a crisp.

07:58.235 --> 08:00.238
We knew that one of you
was African-American,

08:00.239 --> 08:02.238
and your friend was the
one holding the pimp cup.

08:02.239 --> 08:04.106
That was all the evidence we needed.

08:04.107 --> 08:05.708
Isn't this great, Denzel?

08:05.709 --> 08:08.131
I get a chance to experience
life the way you do,

08:08.132 --> 08:11.051
and you get to discover how
lame it is to be white.

08:11.052 --> 08:13.396
I already know it's lame
to be white, Steve!

08:13.397 --> 08:16.398
Ah, from now on, I'm black Steve.

08:16.399 --> 08:19.680
- I'm not gonna call you black Steve.
- Ah, you just did.

08:19.681 --> 08:21.851
- Holler.
- Ugh.

08:21.852 --> 08:25.072
Doc, look. You got to get me back into
some beautiful black skin, right now.

08:25.073 --> 08:27.199
Ooh, smallish problem. We're all out.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.441
Your friend, black Steve, is very fat.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.804
Aw, man, I can't be white.
Anything but white.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.506
Tell you what, I've got a roll of
Mexican I've been trying to get rid of.

08:35.508 --> 08:38.544
No, no, no. White is fine. Thank you.

08:38.544 --> 08:42.730
As any numb nuts can see, the cause
of the fire was not natural.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.234
I'm certain we are dealing with
something far more sinister.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.401
Arson. [Taps fuel tank]

08:47.402 --> 08:50.605
What kind of depraved monster
would do something like this?

08:50.606 --> 08:54.842
Hmm, for some reason, I have
the feeling he has a mustache.

08:54.843 --> 08:56.810
Most arsonists have a mustache.

08:56.811 --> 08:58.178
[Laughs loudly]

- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

09:16.632 --> 09:20.064
You are that man hooker in
Hanoi that I went down on.

09:20.065 --> 09:22.970
That's right.
I'm a male prostitute from Hanoi.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.806
- Thanks for going down on me.
- You're welcome.

09:25.807 --> 09:28.909
Woo, you put on a couple pounds,
didn't you, Phuong Kim?

09:28.910 --> 09:31.545
Wait. You're not vietnamese.

09:31.546 --> 09:33.514
Now I remember you!

09:33.515 --> 09:37.184
You are that waste of space
that washed out of my program.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.621
I knew that you would wind up
in a garbage dump like this.

Malloy, I know he looks like a lame,
white douche, but it's Denzel.

Hey, no matter what color
I am on the outside,

09:52.901 --> 09:55.836

be a dignified black man.

- What? Niggers?

10:18.860 --> 10:20.461
Oh, hell no.

10:20.462 --> 10:23.297
You ain't allowed to say our
word, you white bread cracker.

10:23.298 --> 10:26.667
See, Denzel, when Steve says
it, it's empowering and cool,

10:26.668 --> 10:28.235
when we say it, it's a slur.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.237
We? Are you crazy? I'm black!

10:30.238 --> 10:31.868
- No, not really.
- Not so much.

10:31.869 --> 10:34.143
- You watch your mouth, white boy.
- Hey!

10:34.144 --> 10:36.711
See? Don't make black
Steve have to pop off!

10:36.712 --> 10:38.056
Stop talking like that.

10:38.057 --> 10:41.920
- Back up, back up! Back that ass up!
- Fellas! We don't need a race riot here.

10:41.921 --> 10:44.133
But if we have one, I'd
like you to know right now

10:44.134 --> 10:45.847
that I'm siding with the blacks.

10:45.848 --> 10:49.166
I'm sure baby powder over here didn't
mean anything by it, black Steve.

Listen, Woodrow, black

10:57.732 --> 10:59.798
I need to adjust to the
dubious ramifications,

10:59.799 --> 11:02.435
of my unexpected color-ification.

11:02.436 --> 11:05.405
- Malloy, translation.
- He wants the day off because he's black.

11:05.406 --> 11:07.874
- Sounds fair.
- A day off sounds like a good idea.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.669
I think I need some
counseling or some shit.

If the FBI traces it back
to Denzel and Steve,

13:06.527 --> 13:09.443

- Well, I'm lost.

didn't think there was racism,

now you're mad that he does.

ourselves in his shoes.

- He's only been black for a week.

It might have been a tough week.
We don't know.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just because we talk like Morons,

15:59.776 --> 16:02.979
don't mean we ain't got a nuanced
understanding of social justice.

It doesn't mean anything.

19:50.452 --> 19:53.221
Looks like this is it, bro.
At least we're going out together.

19:53.222 --> 19:55.225
Ste-Zel to the end.

19:55.226 --> 19:58.964
I feel the same way, brother, but I
don't care much for your KKK friends.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.505
Ready? On three. One, two...

20:03.198 --> 20:04.645
Hold on.

20:04.646 --> 20:06.611
It's raining gas, boys!

20:06.612 --> 20:09.672
We're gonna be rich!

20:14.010 --> 20:17.090
Ah, damn it, I meant to
hit the body dump button!

20:17.091 --> 20:20.211
Ah, here we go. Poom!

20:21.350 --> 20:24.770
[Electricity crackles, thud]

20:24.820 --> 20:27.340
Ah, it's gonna be great being black again.

20:27.341 --> 20:31.159
And although I'll be white Steve,
I won't be the same Steve.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.617
I'll be more mature and sensitive.

20:33.618 --> 20:36.264
Well, friends, there's
something I need to tell you.

20:36.265 --> 20:39.148
- We both Mexican, ain't we?
- [Laughs] How'd you guess?

20:39.149 --> 20:43.164
Andale, andale! A-yi, yi, yi, yi, ya!

20:43.165 --> 20:47.245
Would you like to buy some oranges?

20:47.246 --> 20:53.146
