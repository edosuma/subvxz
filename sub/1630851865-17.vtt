00:59.640 --> 01:01.279
It's from my pen pal in India!

01:01.559 --> 01:02.879
That's great!

01:03.599 --> 01:04.440
What's a pen pal?

01:04.560 --> 01:07.080
A pen pal is someone who lives far away,

01:07.200 --> 01:10.039
and you get to be friends by
sending letters back and forth.

01:10.759 --> 01:12.920
-Sounds fun.
-It is fun.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.720
My pen pal, Sukanya, is amazing!

01:15.880 --> 01:17.520
She's an expert Rollerblader,

01:17.679 --> 01:20.160
and lives in a cool neighbourhood
near the Taj Mahal.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.119
Oh!

01:21.280 --> 01:23.479
The Taj Mahal is a famous building

01:23.600 --> 01:25.600
I've always wanted to see.

01:29.039 --> 01:31.640
Sukanya wants us
to come visit her in India sometime.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.320
I'm having a brainstorm!

01:34.440 --> 01:35.759
Already?

01:35.920 --> 01:39.039
But I just unpacked
from your last brainstorm.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.479
Let's go to India today!

01:41.600 --> 01:43.800
We can meet Sukanya together!

01:44.119 --> 01:46.399
I'll tell her the good news on the way!

01:46.560 --> 01:47.880
But I...

01:48.000 --> 01:49.280
Come on, Ollie!

01:49.440 --> 01:52.759
You just said you wanted
to see the Taj Mahal!

01:52.920 --> 01:54.559
Did I say that out loud?

01:54.679 --> 01:56.199
Yup. You did.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.520
Whoo!

02:05.280 --> 02:06.720
Whee!

02:27.239 --> 02:28.040
Whoa!

02:28.160 --> 02:29.880
The Taj Mahal is amazing!

02:30.880 --> 02:33.600
I love the dome, the gardens,

02:33.720 --> 02:38.720
and making another check mark
on my "list of cool stuff to do".

02:58.160 --> 03:00.600
And this is Ollie!

03:01.600 --> 03:04.440
-Hi, Ollie!
-Hi.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.280
Ugh!

03:06.519 --> 03:08.519
Ollie and I just saw the Taj Mahal.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.679
So beautiful!

03:10.799 --> 03:12.679
What else should we do today?

03:12.840 --> 03:16.040
Today, we are going to...

03:16.160 --> 03:19.560
Hoop! Just like you talked about
in your letters!

03:20.239 --> 03:21.840
Uh... hoop?

03:21.959 --> 03:24.120
Yes! Will you teach me?

03:24.239 --> 03:28.280
You know, since you're so amazing at it!

03:28.440 --> 03:29.560
Right.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.320
I forgot I wrote you that.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.600
You're amazing at hooping?
I've never seen you hoop.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.600
I may have exaggerated how good
I am just an eensy-teensy bit.

03:41.079 --> 03:42.640
So... ready?

03:42.760 --> 03:45.720
Um... You know what? I like to...

03:47.679 --> 03:49.359
warm up before I hoop.

03:50.399 --> 03:52.679
For an hour. In private.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.320
You do?

03:54.440 --> 03:56.160
But you can use that time

03:56.320 --> 03:58.720
to get your Rollerblades,
so you can teach us!

03:59.079 --> 04:01.959
You know, since you're
a champion Rollerblader.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.320
Right... I forgot I wrote you that.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.239
Sure. Meet you back here in an hour.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.600
Great!

04:10.200 --> 04:11.359
Great!

04:12.760 --> 04:14.119
OK. Bye!

04:14.239 --> 04:15.720
Bye!

04:16.719 --> 04:17.839
Let's get out of here.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.240
I have to learn
how to use this thing, fast!

04:25.159 --> 04:28.360
This is a good spot.
Just us and some laundry.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.159
Get ready to be wowed, Ollie.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.599
I just need to...

04:41.240 --> 04:42.680
Maybe this way?

04:43.520 --> 04:45.039
That doesn't...

04:45.159 --> 04:46.440
Oh, come on!

04:46.560 --> 04:48.719
Moon, I have to ask.

04:48.919 --> 04:51.360
Why would you tell Sukanya
you're so good at this

04:51.479 --> 04:52.440
when you aren't?

04:52.560 --> 04:55.120
Because... she's so good at Rollerblading,

04:55.320 --> 04:58.479
I wanted her to think I'm really
good at something too.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.840
But you're good at lots of things!

05:01.960 --> 05:04.640
Not this, other things.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.680
Besides, she just wants
to spend time with you.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.840
No, I can't disappoint her now!

05:14.520 --> 05:16.479
Come on, Moon, you got this.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.240
You know, Moon,
I just so happened to pack

05:22.400 --> 05:25.159
a few how-to books and one of them is...

05:26.200 --> 05:29.520
<i>How to Hoop in 45 Easy Steps!</i>

05:29.640 --> 05:32.880
45 steps? There's no time for that!

Oh, no! Help me, Ollie!

05:34.719 --> 05:35.520

05:43.520 --> 05:45.719
Don't worry! I'm on it!

05:45.840 --> 05:47.560
No! It's getting away!

05:48.800 --> 05:52.080
Moon, let's call Sukanya
and tell her what happened.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.560
She'll still like you.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.520
After all, I still like you,
and you just got me all wet!

05:58.159 --> 06:00.120
No, I'm not giving up.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.719
I can do this!

06:07.039 --> 06:09.200

06:09.320 --> 06:10.880
Let's ride in that thing!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.440
Um, Moon? That's called a tuk-tuk

06:13.560 --> 06:15.680
and they are super-duper...

06:16.120 --> 06:16.960
small!

06:18.080 --> 06:19.000

06:57.640 --> 06:59.159
I know she'll still like you.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.919
After all, I still like you,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.599
and you squished me into a tuk-tuk
that made me feel yuck-yuck!

07:04.719 --> 07:05.680
No, Ollie!

07:05.840 --> 07:07.640

07:20.960 --> 07:23.440
It's gone forever!

I'm not doing it.

07:41.039 --> 07:42.159
Will you try?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.320
