WEBVTT

00:05.418 --> 00:07.720
Hey, hey.

00:07.753 --> 00:10.390
Just a fun thought.

00:10.423 --> 00:12.692
If it doesn't sound,
like, too out there,

00:12.725 --> 00:15.995
and if you can get over
your fear of hurting me,

00:16.027 --> 00:18.364
do you think it'd be weird
if I asked you to slap me?

00:18.398 --> 00:20.032
Ow!

00:20.066 --> 00:21.701
Jesus Christ!

00:21.734 --> 00:22.944
What? You asked me to.

00:22.968 --> 00:24.370
Ow!

00:24.404 --> 00:27.107
Ow!

00:56.969 --> 00:59.472
What in God's name...?

01:01.507 --> 01:04.043
Heathrow to I.A.X."

01:04.075 --> 01:05.978
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:06.011 --> 01:07.280
This cannot be happening.

01:07.313 --> 01:09.315
Why would my family
be flying here?

01:09.349 --> 01:10.416
They can't do that.

01:10.450 --> 01:11.951
So tell 'em to suck your dick.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.387
Well, I can't tell them
to suck my dick, Gretchen,

01:14.420 --> 01:15.888
because they're
already in the air!

01:15.921 --> 01:17.290
They arrive in the morning.

01:17.323 --> 01:19.259
For four days?!

01:19.292 --> 01:20.760
Why the hell are they...?

01:22.528 --> 01:26.399
Gretchen, the, uh, the-the...
the letters that I gave you,

01:26.432 --> 01:27.633
you-you didn't...?

01:27.667 --> 01:28.468
Yeah, I mailed them
like you asked.

01:28.501 --> 01:29.502
No!

01:29.535 --> 01:31.237
Why would you do that?!

01:31.271 --> 01:32.472
They were just threats,

01:32.505 --> 01:34.474
so if I didn't hit
the page count,

01:34.507 --> 01:36.909
you were to mail the letters!
I don't get it.

01:36.942 --> 01:38.744
Oh, my God,
and the love letter to Becca.

01:38.778 --> 01:39.845
And there was a third one.

01:39.879 --> 01:41.581
What was it?

01:41.614 --> 01:44.850
Oh, yeah, it was bad.
I remember that.

01:44.884 --> 01:47.119
I'm already regretting
not slapping you harder.

01:47.153 --> 01:49.822
I cannot have these lunatics
in my house.

01:49.855 --> 01:51.533
Gretch, you got to help me.
Promise you'll help me, please.

01:51.557 --> 01:54.194
Can't. Jesus, I thought
you said you were better.

01:54.227 --> 01:55.161
I lied.

01:55.195 --> 01:56.929
Well, fake it and help me!

01:56.962 --> 01:59.031
I don't wanna.
Do you think I "wanna"?

01:59.064 --> 02:00.666
Nobody "wanna"!

02:00.700 --> 02:03.336
But I need your help! Come on!

02:06.206 --> 02:09.209
See? We can do this,
we can do this.

02:09.241 --> 02:10.842
No, you know what?

02:10.876 --> 02:13.513
I shan't be cowed
by a visiting group

02:13.546 --> 02:16.182
of soccer hooligans,
feebs and psychotics

02:16.216 --> 02:18.184
with congenital lead aggression.

02:18.218 --> 02:20.186
Except for my younger sister;
She's all right.

02:20.220 --> 02:24.056
Yes, one look at how
inconceivably far I've come,

02:24.089 --> 02:27.360
and they will see
how together I have it all.

02:27.393 --> 02:28.994
This came for you.

02:31.731 --> 02:33.499
"Dear Jimmy.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.701
"It's donations
like yours that ensure

02:35.735 --> 02:39.572
every young boy gets
the hugs he needs."

02:39.605 --> 02:41.241
Oh, yeah, I knew it was bad.

02:42.575 --> 02:44.744
Yo, can I get this lollipop?

03:27.152 --> 03:29.121
No, no, you promised.

03:32.658 --> 03:34.694
Oh, come on!

03:38.831 --> 03:40.433
Family!

03:40.466 --> 03:41.967
Welcome to America.

03:42.001 --> 03:43.569
Shut up.

03:49.842 --> 03:51.811
I've forgotten what
soft hands you have.

03:51.844 --> 03:54.547
It's like shaking hands
with the royal baby.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.081
Royal girl baby!

03:58.117 --> 03:59.885
Jimmy!

03:59.919 --> 04:02.788
Lilly, oh, my God, look at you!

04:02.822 --> 04:05.425
Uh, you must be
in university by now.

04:05.458 --> 04:08.394
Oh, I was going to go,
but they pointed out

04:08.428 --> 04:10.763
that university is
just a place wankers go

04:10.796 --> 04:12.998
to study poetry and
fist themselves.

04:13.032 --> 04:15.167
Ah, well, that's...

04:18.803 --> 04:20.339
So, Fiona, what have you
been up to?

04:20.373 --> 04:21.741
Work at the Tesco.

04:21.774 --> 04:23.743
You know, the good one
on the north side.

04:23.776 --> 04:24.977
Promoted straight away.

04:25.010 --> 04:27.347
Cashier... free apron
and everything.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.082
Uh, where's Mum?

04:30.115 --> 04:31.984
In Barcelona with Tony.

04:32.017 --> 04:33.486
Who's Tony? Exactly.

04:33.519 --> 04:35.688
I don't know why she married
the bloody tosser.

04:35.721 --> 04:37.122
Wait, what, married?

04:37.156 --> 04:39.124
I don't understand. Me neither.

04:39.158 --> 04:40.793
He smokes those
skinny cigarettes

04:40.826 --> 04:42.962
and doesn't wear socks,
if you know what I mean.

04:42.995 --> 04:44.964
Wait, you got divorced?

04:44.997 --> 04:46.666
Why did nobody tell me?!

04:46.699 --> 04:49.469
Why, look at Jimmy's
fancy little salt dish.

04:49.502 --> 04:52.304
"Oh, I can only have
a little bit of salt,

04:52.338 --> 04:56.342
otherwise me mouth gets too dry
for gobbling knobs."

04:58.811 --> 05:00.012
Uh, just, ah!

05:00.045 --> 05:01.947
Just gonna move my book there.

05:01.981 --> 05:03.649
It's-it's not a coaster.

05:03.683 --> 05:07.520
Although "CoolBookGirl14"
on GoodReads called it

05:07.553 --> 05:10.623
"an emotional roller coaster."

05:10.656 --> 05:12.958
Hello, Shive-Overlys.

05:12.992 --> 05:15.294
I'm Edgar, and, uh,
welcome to our home.

05:15.327 --> 05:16.328
Who's the Paki?

05:16.362 --> 05:18.063
Wow.

05:18.097 --> 05:19.999
Di, that is quite offensive.

05:20.032 --> 05:22.668
First of all, he's my roommate.
"Roommate."

05:22.702 --> 05:25.004
And secondly, he's not
Pakistani, he's Mexican.

05:25.037 --> 05:27.640
Ah, Mexicans... America's Pakis.

05:27.673 --> 05:29.375
I'll be right back.

05:29.409 --> 05:30.876
Gretchen!

05:32.678 --> 05:35.314
Gretchen?

05:35.347 --> 05:37.983
Ladies and gentlemen...

05:38.017 --> 05:42.221
Guys, this is my
girlfriend, Gretchen.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.556
Jimmy, where's your gun?

05:43.589 --> 05:45.357
Why would I have a gun?

05:45.391 --> 05:48.728
Just like Shitty Jimmy to move
to America and not own a gun.

05:48.761 --> 05:50.195
Wait, what did you
just call him?

05:50.229 --> 05:52.565
What's it to you?!
No, I was genuinely asking.

05:52.598 --> 05:55.768
Shitty Jimmy. You don't know
the story of Shitty Jimmy?

05:57.803 --> 05:59.071
It's a good story.

05:59.104 --> 06:00.406
So what happened was, right?

06:00.440 --> 06:02.107
One day, he slipped in shit.

06:02.141 --> 06:05.210
So from then on, we called him
Shitty Jimmy.

06:07.079 --> 06:09.715
We also called him Cock Bandit,

06:09.749 --> 06:12.384
Crybaby Fartface
and Little Jizz Man.

06:12.418 --> 06:14.854
Ah, goddamn it.
Well, my job here is done.

06:14.887 --> 06:17.356
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:17.389 --> 06:19.792
Lilly! Tea!

06:19.825 --> 06:22.027
So...

06:22.061 --> 06:26.031
I thought today we could go see
the giant boulder at LACMA,

06:26.065 --> 06:28.701
then there's a screening of
Vertigo at the cemetery...

06:28.734 --> 06:31.403
Well, obviously we
can't do any of that.

06:31.437 --> 06:35.240
The Eurotune Song
Contest is on all week.

06:35.274 --> 06:37.977
Wait, so you flew
all the way to Los Angeles

06:38.010 --> 06:39.579
just to sit in front
of the telly?

06:39.612 --> 06:41.481
Was it hard to write
a book, Jimmy?

06:41.514 --> 06:43.883
I'm so proud of you.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.586
I always tell the other girls
at Fancy Dames

06:46.619 --> 06:48.721
about my famous brother
in America.

06:48.754 --> 06:51.891
Fancy Dames, the strip club?

06:51.924 --> 06:55.260
Last time I saw you,
you were reading Harry Potter.

06:55.294 --> 06:57.963
Well, I did get a tattoo
of Dobby the House Elf on my...

06:57.997 --> 06:59.765
It's okay. Lilly!

06:59.799 --> 07:01.601
Biscuits!

07:08.641 --> 07:10.976
Then we had to move
the half-price section.

07:11.010 --> 07:12.845
And that was a big to-do,
of course.

07:12.878 --> 07:16.682
Davey said the half-price was
too close to the posh cheeses,

07:16.716 --> 07:19.919
and it didn't make sense,
customer-wise, of course.

07:19.952 --> 07:23.756
Well, I told Davey, "You have
to move the signs then",

07:23.789 --> 07:26.291
'cause obviously
Carrie can't carry 'em."

07:26.325 --> 07:29.161
Why can't Carrie carry them?

07:29.194 --> 07:32.131
Because she's got no arms;
That's why we call her Carrie.

07:32.164 --> 07:33.799
Her real name's Beth.

07:33.833 --> 07:36.168
Did I tell you
what Regina said the other day?

07:36.201 --> 07:38.938
I don't know who Regina is.

07:38.971 --> 07:41.607
Or Davey or Carrie.

07:41.641 --> 07:44.810
You provide literally no
context to your stories.

07:44.844 --> 07:46.612
Regina is Giancarlo's girl.

07:46.646 --> 07:49.615
Anyway, Regina said
that Davey said

07:49.649 --> 07:51.350
that in American grocery stores,

07:51.383 --> 07:54.019
they play a rain
and thunder sound,

07:54.053 --> 07:58.057
and then a machine
spritzes the vegetables.

07:58.090 --> 07:59.391
What a lie.

07:59.424 --> 08:00.693
Can you imagine?

08:00.726 --> 08:02.027
Will you two shut up?

08:02.061 --> 08:04.029
The bleeding Belgians
are cheating again.

08:07.867 --> 08:11.470
Hey, everyone, this is Lindsay.

08:11.503 --> 08:13.305
She's, uh, Gretchen's
best friend.

08:13.338 --> 08:14.583
Come and sit
on my lap, luv.

08:14.607 --> 08:15.975
Oh, don't mind these stains.

08:16.008 --> 08:17.376
Just a bit of bean juice.

08:18.944 --> 08:20.922
Right, I need you to find
Gretchen and get her up here.

08:20.946 --> 08:22.648
And check the closets.

08:22.682 --> 08:23.916
Now, go.

08:25.017 --> 08:26.852
Do gun shows have bazookas?

08:26.886 --> 08:28.888
- Always wanted me own bazooka.
- No idea.

08:28.921 --> 08:31.323
Dad, what happened
with you and Mum?

08:31.356 --> 08:33.225
I don't know.

08:33.258 --> 08:35.327
She just wanted
a bloke like Tony

08:35.360 --> 08:37.996
with his floppy hair
and tight pants.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.364
Bit like you.

08:39.398 --> 08:41.533
How'd you get
your hair so floppy?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.568
You, uh, have a special cream?

08:43.602 --> 08:45.270
Does it come out of a tube?

08:45.304 --> 08:47.206
A flesh-colored tube?

08:49.074 --> 08:50.910
Hey, look who I found.

08:58.483 --> 08:59.919
Who's winning the thing?

08:59.952 --> 09:01.721
Maybe I'd know

09:01.754 --> 09:03.431
if you weren't constantly
yapping in my face

09:03.455 --> 09:04.590
like a goddamn Belgian.

09:07.326 --> 09:08.861
Ugh.

09:08.894 --> 09:13.365
Linds, can you go help Sam
with a wardrobe crisis?

09:13.398 --> 09:15.601
No problem.

09:15.635 --> 09:18.938
I thought all English
people were fancy,

09:18.971 --> 09:23.242
but these are like
Alabama English people.

09:43.095 --> 09:44.830
Jesus.

09:44.864 --> 09:47.432
I have to look extra dope!

09:47.466 --> 09:49.835
Those assholes'
latest track dissed

09:49.869 --> 09:52.104
my wardrobe so thoroughly,

09:52.137 --> 09:54.139
they have me doubting
my signature style

09:54.173 --> 09:57.509
that GQ magazine once called
"courageously headache-y."

09:57.542 --> 09:59.812
Okay, leave it to me.

09:59.845 --> 10:01.280
I'm really good at clothes.

10:01.313 --> 10:03.448
Okay, thanks, Linds.

10:07.286 --> 10:09.154
Have to drop a response track

10:09.188 --> 10:12.624
on they disturbingly
prolific asses right quick.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.794
But I have no ideas for a hook.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.602
Nah, nah.

10:29.008 --> 10:30.676
Nah.

10:44.189 --> 10:45.958
What you singing?

10:45.991 --> 10:47.960
Oh, sorry.

10:47.993 --> 10:49.528
"New phone. Who dis?"

10:49.561 --> 10:51.196
It's the ultimate blow-off.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.733
See, you pretend
not to know who "dis" is.

10:53.766 --> 10:55.067
Huh.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.401
"New phone.

10:56.435 --> 10:58.403
Who dis?"

10:58.437 --> 10:59.404
"New phone.

10:59.438 --> 11:00.740
Who dis?"

11:14.619 --> 11:16.021
Sorry about that.

11:16.055 --> 11:18.357
Just had to take an
important work call.

11:18.390 --> 11:19.658
It's my agent.

11:19.691 --> 11:22.161
Anyway, he loves
my book proposal!

11:22.194 --> 11:24.163
But I have to do a few tweaks.

11:24.196 --> 11:25.765
Thus, unfortunately,

11:25.798 --> 11:27.566
we won't be spending
the whole day together.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.768
Ah.

11:28.801 --> 11:31.003
Time to put on my hard hat...

11:31.036 --> 11:32.838
It's time for you
to drive us to the store

11:32.872 --> 11:34.907
for cigarettes and booze,
you bloody bell end.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.842
We're going outside?

11:36.876 --> 11:38.944
I'll get ready.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.247
Please take them.

11:42.281 --> 11:44.083
I really do have to write.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.518
And stretch it out, yeah?

11:46.551 --> 11:48.229
Show them some important
Los Angeles landmarks,

11:48.253 --> 11:50.122
like where Hugh Grant
got a slob job

11:50.155 --> 11:52.892
or where Mel Gibson called
that lady cop "sugar tits."

11:52.925 --> 11:55.260
Fine.

11:55.294 --> 11:56.762
All right, English people.

11:56.796 --> 11:58.063
Cover your skin.

11:58.097 --> 11:59.264
We're going outside.

11:59.298 --> 12:02.301
Go ahead without me.

12:02.334 --> 12:05.304
I'm, uh... gonna take a walk.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.944
Oh, man.

12:11.977 --> 12:13.813
I'm ready!

12:16.782 --> 12:18.550
Oh, well...

12:18.583 --> 12:20.419
Hey, Lilly?

12:20.452 --> 12:23.055
Uh...

12:23.088 --> 12:25.424
What do you say
to a little tour of the city?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.593
Oh!

12:28.627 --> 12:30.662
Attention, shoppers.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.464
There's a special
on kale in produce.

12:32.497 --> 12:36.435
Cashier to check stand two,
please.

12:36.468 --> 12:37.669
I knew it!

12:37.702 --> 12:39.571
Right.

12:39.604 --> 12:43.642
Let's see what else
about this place is bollocks!

12:52.117 --> 12:54.119
Eh... Hi. Can I help you?

12:54.153 --> 12:56.688
Why aren't the eggs near
the cheeses and all that?

12:56.721 --> 12:58.623
Oh, the eggs have their own case
on aisle four.

12:58.657 --> 12:59.992
What were you looking for?

13:00.025 --> 13:01.026
Organic?

13:01.060 --> 13:02.194
Cage free?

13:02.227 --> 13:04.463
Locally sourced flamingo eggs?

13:06.331 --> 13:08.267
Sorry, ma'am?

13:08.300 --> 13:11.003
We're not allowed to let
you drink that in here.

13:25.184 --> 13:27.920
Move, twat!

13:32.424 --> 13:34.693
Are these all real?

14:01.686 --> 14:04.356
We need immediate cleanup
on aisle 15, please.

14:04.389 --> 14:06.525
An immediate cleanup
on aisle 15.

14:06.558 --> 14:08.027
I can't believe it.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.162
Davey wasn't lying!

14:10.195 --> 14:13.198
I can't go back to Tesco now!

14:13.232 --> 14:14.599
It's shit!

14:14.633 --> 14:16.401
My whole life is shit!

14:16.435 --> 14:18.037
Oh, God.

14:18.070 --> 14:19.738
What have I done?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.773
I've ruined my body!

14:21.806 --> 14:23.775
I'm only 36!

14:29.114 --> 14:30.749
Wow!

14:30.782 --> 14:33.953
It's so big and gray.

14:33.986 --> 14:37.957
Don't tell Jimmy, but I did want

14:37.990 --> 14:39.624
to go to university.

14:39.658 --> 14:42.494
But helping my family was
more important than education.

14:45.497 --> 14:47.432
Have you ever been
horseback riding?

14:47.466 --> 14:49.368
No.

14:49.401 --> 14:51.603
The last horse in our town
was used years ago

14:51.636 --> 14:54.006
to make gelatin for
the lunatic asylum.

15:04.316 --> 15:06.251
What the hell?

15:06.285 --> 15:08.087
You were only gone
for, like, an hour?

15:08.120 --> 15:10.255
Where did you go?

15:11.856 --> 15:14.226
What, did we interrupt
your shitty little writing?

15:14.259 --> 15:15.927
Uh...

15:15.961 --> 15:18.930
This "shitty little writing"
is my second novel

15:18.964 --> 15:20.932
that will probably
spark a bidding war.

15:20.966 --> 15:24.069
Shitty Jimmy moves to America,

15:24.103 --> 15:26.638
and suddenly, he thinks
he's hot fancy shit

15:26.671 --> 15:28.907
and that we'd all be impressed

15:28.940 --> 15:31.510
and somehow forget
that underneath it all,

15:31.543 --> 15:34.980
he's still our little crybaby
wanker brother, Shitty Jimmy.

15:35.014 --> 15:37.983
With your stupid house
and your lump of a girlfriend,

15:38.017 --> 15:39.684
who's clearly miserable

15:39.718 --> 15:42.988
'cause she has to live this
shitty life with Shitty Jimmy!

15:43.822 --> 15:46.158
All right, that's it!

15:48.393 --> 15:50.038
You don't get to tell me
what do to in my house!

15:50.062 --> 15:52.007
Turn that back on
or I'll light your dick on fire!

15:52.031 --> 15:53.999
Everybody, shut up!

15:57.502 --> 15:59.671
You bought a gun?!

15:59.704 --> 16:00.872
Yeah, of course.

16:00.905 --> 16:02.183
The dealer came right up
to the door.

16:02.207 --> 16:03.908
Thought it come
with bullets though.

16:05.077 --> 16:06.945
Did you know my entire childhood

16:06.978 --> 16:08.647
was spent with the lot of you

16:08.680 --> 16:10.315
incessantly mocking me.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.217
The first time I learned
to ride a bicycle

16:12.251 --> 16:14.053
and fell into
that pile of loose lead.

16:15.387 --> 16:17.456
My phase of wearing
mum's high heels.

16:17.489 --> 16:18.723
And, yeah,

16:18.757 --> 16:20.692
the famous
Shitty Jimmy incident,

16:20.725 --> 16:22.194
which, if you remember,

16:22.227 --> 16:24.463
only happened
because Fi pushed me!

16:24.496 --> 16:27.666
In my defense, I only pushed you
so you'd fall in shit!

16:27.699 --> 16:31.002
And now you've come
to cow me again?

16:31.036 --> 16:33.538
Well, it will not work.

16:33.572 --> 16:34.739
Do you know why?

16:34.773 --> 16:36.017
Because I understand
that you're not

16:36.041 --> 16:38.877
the sisters I looked up to,

16:38.910 --> 16:40.045
or the father whose...

16:40.079 --> 16:42.581
or the father whose approval

16:42.614 --> 16:44.216
I desperately wanted.

16:44.249 --> 16:46.518
You are just unhappy,

16:46.551 --> 16:50.021
uneducated garbage!

16:50.055 --> 16:52.857
And I want you out of my house!

16:55.594 --> 16:57.729
It's not funny!

17:01.300 --> 17:03.034
Oh, come on.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.002
Let's go for a drink.

17:05.036 --> 17:06.905
What? We need to talk.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.574
And maybe stop by the bullet
store on the way home.

17:30.329 --> 17:31.530
What?

18:07.031 --> 18:09.434
Look, Jimmy,
I know I've never really been

18:09.468 --> 18:11.336
that good at... you know...

18:11.370 --> 18:13.138
Staying sober past lunch?

18:13.172 --> 18:14.339
Not being racist?

18:14.373 --> 18:16.608
Gastrointestinal control?
Talking.

18:16.641 --> 18:19.010
Well, maybe that's because
whenever I tried to talk to you,

18:19.043 --> 18:21.012
you'd just turn
on a football match.

18:21.045 --> 18:22.847
Well, I didn't know
what to do with you.

18:22.881 --> 18:24.483
I put a ball
down in front of you,

18:24.516 --> 18:25.993
and you'd sit on the ball
and read a book.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.752
Well, you've flown
all the way out here.

18:27.786 --> 18:28.929
What do you want to talk about?

18:28.953 --> 18:30.855
You know...

18:30.889 --> 18:32.424
How are you?

18:32.457 --> 18:33.958
I'm great, Dad.

18:33.992 --> 18:35.960
Thanks.

18:35.994 --> 18:37.529
How's that girlfriend of yours?

18:37.562 --> 18:39.097
She's fine, yeah.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.799
I mean,

18:40.832 --> 18:43.134
recently she's been going
through a bit of a rough patch,

18:43.168 --> 18:44.336
but it'll pass.

18:44.369 --> 18:46.905
It doesn't pass, Jimmy. What?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.876
When we first got married,
it was nice...

18:51.910 --> 18:53.678
for a little while.

18:53.712 --> 18:56.515
And then she started getting
dead moody all the time.

18:56.548 --> 18:59.551
But then ten years went by,
then 20.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.787
And then suddenly, our marriage
was one long rough patch.

19:02.821 --> 19:05.824
You've got a career,
a nice house,

19:05.857 --> 19:07.125
got your own Paki.

19:07.158 --> 19:08.693
Don't do what I did

19:08.727 --> 19:10.662
and let some black cloud
of a bird screw it up.

19:10.695 --> 19:12.497
But I really
like Gretchen, so...

19:12.531 --> 19:13.998
No, there's always more girls.

19:14.032 --> 19:15.600
Hey.

19:17.369 --> 19:18.570
This is my son, Jimmy.

19:18.603 --> 19:19.671
He wrote a novel.

19:19.704 --> 19:20.739
Published and all.

19:20.772 --> 19:21.840
It's quite good.

19:21.873 --> 19:23.908
You'd date him, right?

19:23.942 --> 19:25.844
Eh, I'd snog him.

19:25.877 --> 19:28.980
But I wouldn't
tell anyone about it.

19:29.013 --> 19:30.249
You read my book?

19:30.282 --> 19:32.251
Yeah, I read it, you asshole.

19:32.284 --> 19:34.853
I just didn't want you
to get a big head about it.

19:34.886 --> 19:38.590
But it seemed like
a right proper story.

19:38.623 --> 19:40.091
Just not for me.

19:40.124 --> 19:42.160
So, yeah.

19:42.193 --> 19:45.630
I'm proud of you and all that.

19:50.369 --> 19:52.070
Isn't there a football match on?

19:56.241 --> 19:58.343
I've actually been meaning

19:58.377 --> 19:59.944
to take an online course.

19:59.978 --> 20:03.181
And I was thinking maybe
we could do it together.

20:03.214 --> 20:04.916
I would love to!

20:04.949 --> 20:06.785
Can we sit next to each other?

20:06.818 --> 20:08.787
You understand it's online?

20:08.820 --> 20:11.256
Oh, right.

20:19.063 --> 20:21.132
Got you a little present.

20:21.165 --> 20:22.767
What?

20:22.801 --> 20:24.536
Ah!

20:24.569 --> 20:27.238
It made me feel like God.

20:27.272 --> 20:29.608
I don't want to be God.

20:30.575 --> 20:31.943
I paid 250 yesterday,

20:31.976 --> 20:34.546
so I was thinking maybe 225.

20:34.579 --> 20:36.881
I'm not paying you for that gun.

20:36.915 --> 20:38.550
Fine!

20:38.583 --> 20:41.019
Stick with your pepper spray
and your rape whistle then!

20:46.858 --> 20:48.226
Bye!

20:48.259 --> 20:50.329
Bye, Shitty Jimmy!

20:53.164 --> 20:55.033
Oh, my God!

20:58.937 --> 21:00.238
Really?

21:00.271 --> 21:02.073
Nothing to say about my family?

21:02.106 --> 21:03.775
Well, how about this?

21:03.808 --> 21:07.145
I'm requesting that my
girlfriend let me vent,

21:07.178 --> 21:09.089
because she's interested in
what's going on with me.

21:09.113 --> 21:12.016
I can't.

21:13.885 --> 21:16.821
You mean you won't.

21:30.802 --> 21:33.071
Rough day?

21:33.972 --> 21:37.308
It was a rough four days.

21:37.342 --> 21:39.043
My dad bought a gun.

21:39.077 --> 21:41.245
Wait, what?

21:45.584 --> 21:47.619
Back up.

21:47.652 --> 21:49.754
Start from the beginning.

21:52.357 --> 21:53.892
Okay.

21:53.925 --> 21:57.161
So my oldest sister, Fiona,

21:57.195 --> 21:58.463
she's obsessed with her job.

21:58.497 --> 21:59.864
Kept talking about
all these people

21:59.898 --> 22:01.332
that she was working with.

22:01.366 --> 22:03.001
She works in a supermarket.

22:03.034 --> 22:06.304
And then my youngest
sister Lilly...

22:31.796 --> 22:33.932
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

22:42.106 --> 22:45.343

endurance...

22:54.419 --> 22:55.954
may produce champions,

22:55.987 --> 22:58.790
but legends
really come to life...

Sunny is back...

23:45.036 --> 23:46.771
Ha-ha-ha!

23:46.805 --> 23:50.408
For an all new season.

23:52.677 --> 23:54.913
It's Sunny. Premieres January.

24:00.151 --> 24:02.286
- Hey, lock up your daughters.
- Ugh.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.627
And that was the last time
I ate Indian food before a date.

24:11.162 --> 24:14.165
What do I do-do?
Currently I am...

24:15.199 --> 24:17.969
a temp.

24:18.002 --> 24:20.038
And you must be from Tennessee

24:20.071 --> 24:22.273
because you're the only
"10 I see." -

24:22.306 --> 24:24.042

24:29.714 --> 24:31.215
So this is where you live?

24:31.249 --> 24:32.617
Yeah. It's only permanent.

24:32.651 --> 24:34.786
Thanks for everything.

24:39.057 --> 24:41.292
You left all your stuff!

24:41.325 --> 24:43.061
Right. Right. Sorry.

24:43.094 --> 24:44.495
Knee-jerk reaction.
