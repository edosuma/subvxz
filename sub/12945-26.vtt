WEBVTT

00:02.734 --> 00:03.734
Ooh!

00:12.934 --> 00:14.400
Ooh! Nice one, Gordo. [CHUCKLES]

00:14.467 --> 00:15.834
This is Gordo's house.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.133
Who talks like that?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.667
-Give me the rock.
-Ethan does.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.367
I'm not a big fan of gym.
Especially basketball.

00:22.433 --> 00:24.967
But when the opportunity
to guard Ethan Craft comes up,

00:25.033 --> 00:26.133
[CHUCKLES] you take it.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.300
Oh! Miranda's got game.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.400
I want game!

00:34.467 --> 00:36.133
Our game is busy guarding Ethan.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.400
True, but it's worth every second.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.900
All right, watch
and see how it's done.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.266
[BUZZES]

01:00.033 --> 01:01.800
Uh, is that how it's done, Gordo?

01:02.166 --> 01:03.333
How did he do that?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.200
Maybe next time, little man.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.734
Is there anything Ethan can't do?

01:08.800 --> 01:11.300
Yeah, count past ten
without taking his shoes off.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.033
But if he was cute and smart,

01:14.100 --> 01:15.400
he'd be Super Ethan,

01:15.467 --> 01:18.200
and I don't think
the universe is ready for that.

01:18.266 --> 01:19.266
But I am.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.000
Can we talk about something else?

01:21.066 --> 01:23.600
How about who Ethan's gonna ask
to the dance Friday?

01:23.667 --> 01:24.700
Ooh.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.934
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

01:27.100 --> 01:29.867
I mean, I-I don't care. Oh, whatever.

01:29.934 --> 01:32.433
Oh, I doubt he's gonna ask you guys.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.800
BOTH: [SCOFFS] Gordo!

01:34.066 --> 01:36.767
It's probably true,
but he doesn't have to say it.

01:36.834 --> 01:39.367
You're just saying that 'cause you
don't have a date for the dance.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.834
Look, middle school's hard enough
without the added pressure

01:41.900 --> 01:43.433
of who I'm taking to the dance.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.734
So I guess
we're all three going together? Cool?

01:46.266 --> 01:48.767
I guess it's just
the Three Amigos, flying solo.

01:49.633 --> 01:51.033
Uh, hey, guys.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.100
-Hey, Parker.
-Hi.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.667
-Hey.
-So, Gordo,

01:53.734 --> 01:55.166
you're a pretty good
basketball player.

01:55.233 --> 01:58.333
I am? Oh! [CHUCKLES]
Yeah, I [STUTTERS] am.

02:00.433 --> 02:03.233
Parker complimenting Gordo
on basketball?

02:03.300 --> 02:05.467
You don't think... Nah.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.700
Yeah, you were totally robbed
of that last basket.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.767
Thanks, uh, I was.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.133
Yep. See you around.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.266
Later.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.500
What was that?

02:15.567 --> 02:18.200
Apparently, Gordo's
new best friend, Parker.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.967
Think I'm gonna ask her to the dance.

02:22.066 --> 02:24.066
One compliment, and Parker's in?

02:24.133 --> 02:27.800
I compliment Ethan every day
and he's never asked me to a dance.

02:27.867 --> 02:30.400
But what about
our no-dates-to-the-dance policy?

02:30.467 --> 02:32.200
What, I [STUTTERS] can change my mind.

02:32.266 --> 02:34.166
Maybe it's time to take a chance.

02:34.233 --> 02:35.233
Live a little.

02:37.200 --> 02:42.133
[SIGHS] Well, I guess
it's just the two amigos.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.567
[SIGHS] Yeah, well,

02:43.633 --> 02:45.600
you're a better dancer
than Gordo, anyway. [CHUCKLES]

02:46.700 --> 02:48.734
[THEME SONG PLAYING]

03:31.333 --> 03:33.033
-Hey, Matt.
-How was your day?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.233
I need to talk to you guys.

03:35.667 --> 03:40.033
One day. Could we have one day without
him getting into trouble? [SIGHS]

03:40.100 --> 03:41.066
What's up?

03:41.133 --> 03:44.433
Um, we have to kinda
give a report at school

03:44.500 --> 03:47.200
about our ancestors,
and I was wondering,

03:47.266 --> 03:49.300
do we have any ancestors?

03:49.667 --> 03:52.200
Of course we do.
What kinda stuff do you need to know?

03:52.266 --> 03:54.767
Not much.
Just where we came from and stuff.

03:55.333 --> 04:00.033
Oh, uh, my grandparents came here
from Poland during World War II.

04:00.100 --> 04:03.934
My grandfather worked on
an assembly line in a candy factory,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.033
and my grandmother
worked in a hospital making beds.

04:08.734 --> 04:09.734
Interesting.

04:12.066 --> 04:14.767
Please tell me you've got
something better than that!

04:14.834 --> 04:16.100
Please!

04:16.500 --> 04:19.133
How about
William "Braveheart" Wallace?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.667
The guy who freed Scotland
from English rule.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.367
That's pretty good.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.767
If it were true.
Which it's not.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.800
Your father came from dairy farmers
in Kalamazoo.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.834
I'm just tryin'
to spice it up a little.

04:31.900 --> 04:35.133
He doesn't need spice. He needs
to know about his family history.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.000
I was just hoping we were related
to someone famous.

04:39.066 --> 04:41.533
I mean, Lanny's related
to Crispus Attucks.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.967
He was the first American
to be killed in the Revolutionary War.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.066
Really? That's pretty cool.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.100
But, I guess we're just
the "boring" McGuires.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.734
I'll just go upstairs and write
my "boring" report.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.433
Dairy farmers?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.033
So, did you ask her yet?

05:08.233 --> 05:09.734
Uh, no. [CHUCKLES]

05:09.800 --> 05:12.000
So, what, you changed your mind?

05:12.066 --> 05:13.233
Well, no.

05:14.333 --> 05:18.066
He's so nervous.
It's like alternate universe Gordo.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.767
Aw, it's so cute.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.767
Well, go ask her.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.867
Yeah, it's not that hard.

05:23.934 --> 05:26.834
Have either of you
ever asked Ethan Craft out to a dance?

05:27.166 --> 05:28.166
BOTH: No.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.467
-And why not?
-Because it'd be so embarrassing.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.533
Mortifying.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
Exactly.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.200
I guess being a guy is harder
than I thought.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.066
Come on, Gordo, you can do this.

05:37.133 --> 05:40.033
Yeah, the worst she can say is,
um, [SMACKS LIPS] "no."

05:40.934 --> 05:43.166
But if she did, then you'd just
be stuck with us.

05:44.233 --> 05:45.400
But she won't. [CHUCKLES]

05:45.867 --> 05:48.767
Uh, okay. Wish me luck.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.633

Hey, Parker. [CHUCKLES]

05:59.133 --> 06:00.133
Hey.

06:04.934 --> 06:05.934
Oh...

06:07.233 --> 06:09.033
So, uh, math homework, huh?

06:09.700 --> 06:11.233
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.800
Lots of math homework.

06:12.867 --> 06:14.700
Yeah. It is.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.667
So, uh, did you hear
the one about the King of Norway?

06:18.734 --> 06:20.567
-[LIZZIE SIGHS]
-So, what's going on?

06:20.633 --> 06:22.000
It doesn't look good.

06:22.066 --> 06:24.500
I hope he didn't tell
the King of Norway joke.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.467
Ooh, I-I think he's gonna ask.

06:27.767 --> 06:31.000
He's the one doing the asking,
and I'm the one who's nervous.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.066
Well, it was great talking to you,
Gordo, but I gotta motor.

06:34.133 --> 06:38.133
Oh, um, okay.
Uh, Parker, I was wondering...

06:38.467 --> 06:39.633
Uh-huh?

06:39.700 --> 06:43.133
Do you think you'd, maybe,
like to go to the dance with me?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.567
Oh. Wow.

06:46.633 --> 06:49.400
Um, I'm sorry, I can't.

06:56.367 --> 06:57.767
Looks like a "no."

07:04.066 --> 07:07.834
Maybe I'm related to Mark McGwire.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.400
It could happen.

07:11.266 --> 07:14.400
I can't believe you're related
to Crispus Attucks.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.867
I mean, he's an American patriot.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.967
And I have to follow it up
with a report that says

07:21.033 --> 07:24.066
I'm related
to Kalamazoo dairy farmers.

07:24.633 --> 07:25.967
[COW MOOING]

07:26.767 --> 07:29.533
Okay, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow, Lanny.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.533
This is hard. I mean,
there's so much out there.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.734
I could be related
to George Washington

07:39.800 --> 07:41.166
and not even know it.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.233
[DING]

07:44.600 --> 07:46.834
And no one else would know it either.

07:49.266 --> 07:52.533
Or maybe I could remember the Alamo.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.300
Or maybe Elvis.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.233
Yeah. That's it.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.467
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.433
Okay, so tell me
exactly what Parker said.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.934
She said, "Sorry, I can't."

08:12.000 --> 08:13.667
But it looked like
everything was going great.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.967
Yeah, I know.
I... I guess I'm just the guy

08:16.033 --> 08:17.467
you say "hi" to in the hallway,

08:17.533 --> 08:19.233
and not the guy
you actually go out with.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.367
No, uh, Gordo, [SIGHS]
that doesn't make any sense.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.667
It's Parker. She's weird.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.266
[MOUTHING]

08:28.066 --> 08:30.700
That girl's got some 'splaining to do.

08:32.266 --> 08:33.700
I'm gonna be right back. [SIGHS]

08:35.433 --> 08:36.433
Uh, Parker?

08:36.867 --> 08:38.166
Oh, hi, Lizzie.

08:38.233 --> 08:39.800
Hey. So, um,

08:40.333 --> 08:42.266
it looked like you and Gordo
were having a good time. [CHUCKLES]

08:42.333 --> 08:43.867
Yeah. He's pretty cool.

08:43.934 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, he is.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.600
So why'd you turn him down
for the dance?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.033
Because he's short.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.333
That's not a reason.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.867
"I can't go because my cat died"
is a reason.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.800
Parker, you are short.

08:58.867 --> 09:01.000
Listen, Lizzie,
I know he's your friend.

09:01.066 --> 09:04.100
Well, he's a great guy
to hang out with and all,

but I don't wanna go out
with a short guy.

what other people think.

Or maybe not. [SIGHS]

09:21.867 --> 09:23.266

09:39.333 --> 09:40.333
[SIGHS]

09:41.266 --> 09:43.834
So, have you talked to Gordo
since yesterday?

09:43.900 --> 09:46.400
[SIGHS] I tried calling him,
but his parents said

09:46.467 --> 09:47.467
he was doing homework.

09:47.533 --> 09:50.567
He's doing homework? See?
I told you he'd get over it.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.600
I don't know. I've never seen Gordo
take anything so personally.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.400
I mean, it's Gordo.

09:55.467 --> 09:58.500
Yeah, I know. He's usually the one
telling us not to care

09:58.567 --> 10:00.066
what other people think.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.667
It's like we've switched identities.

to a rodeo or something?

10:21.066 --> 10:24.667
What, these? I've had 'em forever.
I've worn 'em, like, a million times.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.533
Hold it right there, partner.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.200
I don't think
you're telling the truth.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.967
The price tag is still on them.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.300
Uh, Gordo, about yesterday...

10:34.367 --> 10:37.367
I'm fine. Did you know that
the average 14-year-old male

10:37.433 --> 10:40.066
is 5'6", which makes me
only four inches shorter

10:40.133 --> 10:41.567
than the average 14-year-old male.

10:41.633 --> 10:44.367
Well, good for
the average 14-year-old male, then.

10:44.433 --> 10:47.266
But, Gordo,
you've always been above average.

10:47.333 --> 10:50.734
Exactly, and most males
hit their growth spurt by 15.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.834
Which means I still have a year
to grow. Everything's cool.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.700
Oh, so, you're cool
with Ethan and Parker

10:55.767 --> 10:58.734
going to the dance together.
[CHUCKLES]

11:00.100 --> 11:02.700
And the award
for bad timing goes to...

Tall guys get everything.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.100
Since when is Parker "everything"?

11:09.166 --> 11:12.066
With the way she treated Gordo,
she's not anything.

11:12.133 --> 11:16.567
I know. [SMACKS LIPS]
Ethan could do so much better.

11:16.633 --> 11:17.900
That's not what I meant.

11:17.967 --> 11:18.967
What did you mean, then?

11:19.033 --> 11:20.700
You guys are a part
of the problem, you know?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.333
You buy into the whole tall-guy thing.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.467
Look at who you have a crush on,
Ethan Craft.

11:25.533 --> 11:27.867
[SCOFFS] We don't like him
'cause he's tall.

11:27.934 --> 11:29.867
Why, then? Because he's smart?

11:30.266 --> 11:33.133
You know what? Just...
Just leave me alone. Forget it.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.834
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen Gordo... this way.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.934
What do you do
when the person with all the answers

11:39.000 --> 11:40.567
is the person with the problem?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.333
I'm gonna go talk to him.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.300
No. Just give him some time.
