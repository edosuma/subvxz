00:17.485 --> 00:20.325
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome your host</i>

00:20.405 --> 00:24.445
-<i>and founder, Mrs Ivy Mittelfart!</i>

00:24.845 --> 00:26.525
Well, howdy, y'all!

00:27.525 --> 00:33.405
May I say how wonderful it is
to be here among so many old,

00:33.485 --> 00:35.405
old friends.

00:35.485 --> 00:38.125
And what do all these old friends
have in common?

00:38.205 --> 00:41.365
Well, here's a hint -
it's green, it folds

00:41.445 --> 00:44.405
and it rhymes with
"truck roads of honey"!

00:44.485 --> 00:47.165
-Seriously, give generously.

00:49.405 --> 00:51.125
Oh, hey, over here.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.685
Well...?

00:57.765 --> 00:59.445
-We found him.
-Oh!

00:59.525 --> 01:01.085
Ken Thompson.

01:01.165 --> 01:03.685
He's an attorney,
lives in Litchfield, England.

01:03.765 --> 01:06.725
My, my! Ken Thompson.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.005
Wife, Lorna.

01:08.085 --> 01:10.165
Kids, Rachel, Dylan, Sid.

01:10.245 --> 01:13.565
Funny story. Seven years ago,
Rachel, the daughter,

01:13.645 --> 01:16.765
married this eccentric hippy,
a guy named Cuckoo.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.925
-They--
-How long does this story last?

01:19.005 --> 01:20.405
It's fairly convoluted.

01:20.485 --> 01:22.845
Just give me the file.
I'll catch up on the plane.

01:25.325 --> 01:27.085
My, my!

01:27.165 --> 01:29.005
I have a brother.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.805
So, tell us about your trip, love.

01:37.885 --> 01:41.085
Sierra Leone was so intense,
it made me realise

01:41.165 --> 01:44.605
I need to get my shit together,
start working for what I believe in.

01:44.685 --> 01:49.765
Otherwise, the world is forever going to
be run by boring, white, middle-aged men.

01:49.845 --> 01:52.725
-Sorry, Dad.
-No, <i>I'm </i>sorry for all injustice ever.

01:52.805 --> 01:55.205
Point is, I'm an independent woman.

01:55.765 --> 01:58.405
-The world needs to feel my power.
-You still staying with us?

01:58.485 --> 02:00.565
-Yeah, is that all right?
-Where's Dale?

02:01.125 --> 02:02.685
Yeah, I'm sorry, Sid, er...

02:03.685 --> 02:06.285
-He's gone.
-Did you make him leave?

02:09.045 --> 02:11.365
-Speak.
-Hi, am I speaking with Ken Thompson?

02:11.445 --> 02:12.965
-Yep.
-Great.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.765
-Ken, how's it going today?
-Yes, it's great, thank you.

02:15.845 --> 02:16.885
<i>So great that it's going great.</i>

02:16.965 --> 02:18.445
<i>I'm just reaching out</i>

02:18.525 --> 02:20.325
about your meeting
with Ivy Mittelfart next week.

02:20.405 --> 02:22.165
-She's super-excited.
-Never heard of her.

02:22.245 --> 02:25.205
<i>You're saying you're not going to meet her</i>
<i>when she comes to the UK next Wednesday?</i>

02:25.285 --> 02:28.445
Yes, as I've already said.
Look, can you go through my secretary?

02:28.525 --> 02:32.205
It's the weekend over here, and in England
we have this thing called not working.

02:32.285 --> 02:35.085
<i>OK, I'll talk to your assistant</i>
<i>and we can arrange another time</i>

02:35.165 --> 02:36.965
<i>for you and your sister to meet.</i>

02:37.045 --> 02:38.485
Sorry?

02:38.565 --> 02:40.085
My sister?

02:41.925 --> 02:42.845
A sister!

02:42.925 --> 02:44.965
I've got a sister
and she's coming to see us!

02:45.045 --> 02:48.725
It's exciting!
I always felt sorry for you, Ken.

02:48.805 --> 02:51.925
An only child, huge and isolated.

02:52.005 --> 02:56.285
So, your biological dad, Big Jack,
had another kid in America?

02:56.365 --> 02:57.885
Yeah, before he had his fling
with my mum.

02:57.965 --> 02:59.765
I don't know why
she's coming to see us now.

02:59.845 --> 03:01.685
-She obviously wants something.
-I'd say that's unlikely.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.365
"The Mittelfart Foundation
is a charitable endeavour

03:04.445 --> 03:06.805
dedicated to the improvement
of human life,

03:06.885 --> 03:10.685
founded by billionaire Ron Mittelfart
and wife Ivy."

03:12.325 --> 03:14.965
-I'm sorry, did you say billionaire?
-Yeah!

03:15.045 --> 03:17.045
Bloody hell!
We should probably tidy up.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.965
He's a financier. Yeah, that's the sort
that prey on developing economies.

03:22.045 --> 03:24.645
-Uhhhh.
-She's probably got a blinking yacht!

03:24.725 --> 03:26.045
-Mum!
-Oh, my God.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.845
She probably knows Barack Obama.
We'd get on, me and him.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.565
Yeah, he'd like me, Barack.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.485
Not so worried about having a sister now,
are you?

03:32.565 --> 03:34.005
I'm getting used to it, gradually!

03:38.125 --> 03:40.405
Tonight, we shall be eating
à la gourmand!

03:40.485 --> 03:42.925
To start, your guilty pleasure,
scallops.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.805
Ooh, and a bacon cream!

03:44.885 --> 03:47.325
I love that stuff. Like pork toothpaste!

03:48.005 --> 03:51.765
What a fantastic summer evening!

03:51.845 --> 03:54.245
God, Mum, I like this outfit!

03:54.325 --> 03:56.165
-Aw, thanks, Dyl!

03:56.245 --> 03:57.765
Smells glorious, big guy,

03:57.845 --> 04:01.205
and I have got the perfect Malbec.

04:01.285 --> 04:03.605
High country, stuffed with blackcurrants.

04:03.685 --> 04:06.125
It's like Ribena grew up and got naughty.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.565
Hm!

04:07.645 --> 04:11.165
Wow! I have always wanted a child
from the shit bit of the '80s.

04:11.245 --> 04:12.645
So, what time's this aunt arriving?

04:12.725 --> 04:14.885
I'm struggling to shift that converted
windmill out by Fradley.

04:14.965 --> 04:16.805
-Need a high-worth purchaser.
-Er...

04:17.445 --> 04:19.645
-Rachel, you're back!
-Dylan!

04:19.725 --> 04:22.365
Yeah, I'd heard you'd become
an estate agent. No surprise.

04:22.445 --> 04:24.285
Yeah, well, it's a job, isn't it?

04:24.365 --> 04:28.085
Beats being the kind of loser that's 27
and still living at home with their par--

04:28.165 --> 04:29.925
That's exactly your situation, isn't it?

04:30.005 --> 04:31.365
-Funny.

04:31.445 --> 04:35.685
OK, all right. Now, remember,
my sister is a pretty classy customer,

04:35.765 --> 04:39.125
so, everyone, just pretend to be better
than you actually are.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.365
-Ill met by moonlight, proud Ken.
-Oh, God.

04:45.445 --> 04:48.205
Saw candles in the kitchen,
looked like a party.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.645
So, flagon of home-brew

04:50.725 --> 04:52.605
and a brace of pheasant
I clipped on the morning drive.

04:52.685 --> 04:54.965
The tyre tracks will wash off.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.725
It's a family dinner, Steve.

04:56.805 --> 05:02.005
-Really? Ain't no room for Uncle Steve?
-You and I are not related.

05:02.645 --> 05:05.805
-Now, beat it, you creepy fraggle.

05:07.725 --> 05:08.765
She's here!

05:21.205 --> 05:24.045
Oh, bajambas. Sweet bajambas!

05:24.125 --> 05:26.285
Do I <i>like </i>that coconut?

05:26.845 --> 05:28.645
Ah! Ken!

05:29.205 --> 05:32.045
The image, the image of Daddy!

05:32.125 --> 05:34.565
It's like he's been born again,
brought up in England

05:34.645 --> 05:36.325
and strapped on a belly!

05:36.405 --> 05:38.205
-Oh!

05:38.285 --> 05:41.045
Ken, brother, can we hug?

05:41.125 --> 05:42.725
I don't see why not? Ah!

05:43.285 --> 05:45.085
Ah!

05:46.325 --> 05:47.765
Well, this is my family.

05:47.845 --> 05:49.725
-Um... This is my wife, Lorna.
-Hello.

05:49.805 --> 05:51.285
-My daughter, Rachel.
-Hello.

05:51.365 --> 05:53.925
Look at you, tiny, tiny girls!

05:55.125 --> 05:58.805
And your son, mmm, quite the young stud!

05:58.885 --> 06:00.525
Oh, no, he's only four.

06:02.325 --> 06:03.765
Oh, no, that's Dylan.

06:03.845 --> 06:05.525
-Oh.

06:05.605 --> 06:08.605
This is Steve,
he is <i>not </i>a member of the family.

06:08.685 --> 06:10.365
Steve Chance.

06:10.445 --> 06:13.685
Uber driver, unlicensed medic,
aspirant warlock.

06:13.765 --> 06:15.605
I have many girlfriends.

06:15.685 --> 06:17.805
OK. My turn!

06:19.645 --> 06:22.445
This is Tigran, my PA.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.565
-Oh!
-All right?

06:24.645 --> 06:28.565
-And this is Miss Tigglytopps.

06:28.645 --> 06:30.005
Massive!

06:30.085 --> 06:32.205
We are best friends!

06:32.285 --> 06:35.165
-Aren't we, precious?
-Well, look, let's, erm...

06:35.805 --> 06:39.725
-Let's all go inside.
-Well, I do have a few bags.

06:39.805 --> 06:42.365
-Not a problem. We'll help, won't we?
-Absolutely!

06:42.445 --> 06:43.925
Thank you!

06:44.005 --> 06:45.645
Aw!

06:45.725 --> 06:48.045
Sweet, sweet bajambas!

06:52.125 --> 06:53.165
Here you are.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.525
Welcome, sis.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.205
Oh, wow!

06:56.285 --> 06:58.085
Would you look at this?

06:58.165 --> 06:59.605
Modest!

06:59.685 --> 07:04.485
But I bet, to you guys,
it feels like a palace, am I right?

07:04.565 --> 07:07.565
Yes! I'm right!

07:07.645 --> 07:09.485
Munchkinland!

07:15.205 --> 07:20.205
When I was 18, I dreamed of doing
something really good for the world.

07:20.285 --> 07:24.125
But then I realised I was extremely
good-looking, so I decided to model.

07:24.805 --> 07:27.165
Modelling? Oh, I bet that was exciting.

07:27.245 --> 07:29.725
Oh, Lorna, modelling is so superficial,

07:29.805 --> 07:32.365
but you do meet a lot of rich men.

07:32.445 --> 07:34.645
I remember the day that I met Ron.

07:34.725 --> 07:37.925
Then I found out he was a billionaire.
It was love!

07:38.005 --> 07:38.885
Oh!

07:38.965 --> 07:42.525
Two weeks later, Whitney Houston was
singing at our wedding for crack money!

07:43.085 --> 07:45.285
- Oh!
-But enough about me.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.845
Tell me about you.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.205
Oh! OK, well...

07:49.285 --> 07:53.245
Um, I grew up round here
and I headed up a law firm round here.

07:53.325 --> 07:55.845
Um, then I changed job,

07:55.925 --> 07:58.925
and now I'm at a new place... round here.

08:00.405 --> 08:01.325
Doing law.

08:01.405 --> 08:02.925
Erm, yeah.

08:04.325 --> 08:05.725
Isn't it fascinating?

08:05.805 --> 08:08.845
Here, my life has been
so extraordinary,

08:08.925 --> 08:12.285
and you, with half the same genes,
are so ordinary!

08:12.365 --> 08:14.885
I find that sort of beautiful!

08:15.925 --> 08:17.125
Oh. Yes!

08:19.165 --> 08:22.125
Yeah, I suppose it is. It is.
It's sort of beautiful, isn't it?

08:22.205 --> 08:24.605
-Yeah!

08:24.685 --> 08:27.845
Don't worry, I'll get her down.
She just gets very upset when we fly.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.165
I'll give her some Xanax.

08:32.565 --> 08:35.125
-She's all right, isn't she?
-She seems nice.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.085
-Yes, gorgeous.

08:41.165 --> 08:43.845
I know Ron hasn't called us.

08:43.925 --> 08:47.085
But trust me, honey,
he would not abandon us like this.

08:47.165 --> 08:49.445
-Now, what about your mindfulness?

08:49.525 --> 08:51.845
Close your eyes, feel your breath.

08:51.925 --> 08:54.285
-Deep breath in...

08:54.365 --> 08:55.565
Deep breath out.

08:55.645 --> 08:57.525
That's right!

08:57.605 --> 09:00.285
Just notice your breath. Rachel!

09:00.885 --> 09:02.485
Talking to your dog there?

09:02.565 --> 09:04.005
Oh, yes.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.245
We talk all the time,
but usually not in public

09:07.325 --> 09:11.085
because when you tell people
that your dog is your best friend

09:11.165 --> 09:14.805
and most trusted adviser,
they think you're kind of crazy!

09:16.405 --> 09:18.485
Would you look at you?

09:18.565 --> 09:22.325
Huh! You know, I think you have a touch
of the family's good looks.

09:22.405 --> 09:23.765
Just a touch,

09:23.845 --> 09:25.525
but it's there.

09:26.685 --> 09:31.245
Oh, honey, come on in
and tell Aunt Ivy all about the boys.

09:34.845 --> 09:37.445
Um, well, I'm just focusing
on my career at the moment.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.885
-I work in charity.
-Oh! I've done charity all my life.

09:41.965 --> 09:44.445
-Yeah?
-You know, sometimes it's not the system.

09:44.525 --> 09:47.045
Sometimes, they are just lazy.

09:48.845 --> 09:50.165
Are they?

09:50.245 --> 09:52.205
Now, you may think this sounds shallow,

09:52.285 --> 09:56.085
but it seems to me
that you are trying to sell this,

09:56.165 --> 09:58.365
when you should be selling <i>this</i>!

09:58.445 --> 10:02.685
Because this seems like
a Grade C commodity.

10:02.765 --> 10:05.325
While this - wooh! - solid B.

10:06.765 --> 10:08.005
Great chat, Aunt Ivy.

10:09.645 --> 10:10.805
I'm just going to...

10:13.325 --> 10:16.965
Come on, Miss Tigglytopps, let's
snuggle! Yes, you're a snuggle bunny!

10:22.125 --> 10:23.845
-To us!
-To us.

10:27.845 --> 10:29.885
I must say, it is...
pretty cool to have a sister!

10:33.245 --> 10:34.925
I know, look at us!

10:35.005 --> 10:36.365
To Daddy.

10:36.445 --> 10:38.445
Oh! To Big Jack.

10:38.525 --> 10:41.365
May he be in heaven playing his harp,

10:41.445 --> 10:43.645
impregnating all the angels.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.405
-You're funny!
-Oh.

10:48.085 --> 10:50.325
We should probably get down to business.

10:50.405 --> 10:52.565
Oh, absolutely! What business?

10:52.645 --> 10:54.605
You must be wondering why I'm here.

10:55.365 --> 10:56.405
Well...

10:57.405 --> 10:59.245
you came to see me, I presumed.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.525
Of course, that. Mostly that!

11:02.605 --> 11:06.285
There is another thing,
a little proposition I have for you.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.925
Oh! OK.

11:08.485 --> 11:09.965
I'm listening.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.405
Ken, how do you feel about death?

11:14.085 --> 11:15.525
I would say...

11:16.125 --> 11:18.405
-I'm not a fan!
-Me, too.

11:18.485 --> 11:20.285
Life good, death bad.

11:20.365 --> 11:22.005
That is my unique take on it.

11:22.085 --> 11:23.965
-Right.
-So, what if I were to tell you

11:24.045 --> 11:25.845
you don't have to die?

11:25.925 --> 11:27.285
Well, I'd say,

11:27.365 --> 11:30.765
"Someone get this woman away
from me! She's insane! Aah!"

11:30.845 --> 11:34.685
Ken, I'm serious. Mine and Ron's
foundation studies genes in ageing.

11:34.765 --> 11:38.085
Now, our shared father possessed
a fascinating genotype.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.045
Our scientists discovered
that for people with his genes,

11:41.125 --> 11:45.325
there is a chance, in time, they could
wholly eliminate the effects of ageing.

11:45.845 --> 11:46.965
What?

11:48.125 --> 11:52.405
-So we could live forever?
- No! You've got me all wrong.

11:52.485 --> 11:54.765
-Oh, well, good bec--
-I could live forever.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.405
Me, Ivy Mittelfart.

11:56.485 --> 12:00.565
I could be young and beautiful
and alive forever.

12:00.645 --> 12:02.805
All I need from my brand-new brother

12:02.885 --> 12:05.405
is the chance to do research
on his dead body.

12:06.605 --> 12:07.645
But I'm not dead!

12:07.725 --> 12:08.885
Not yet!

12:08.965 --> 12:11.965
But I'm saying,
I give you a fat load of cash now

12:12.045 --> 12:14.805
and then when you croak,
my foundation gets in there

12:14.885 --> 12:17.285
and does experiments on your corpse.

12:17.365 --> 12:18.565
Simple!

12:20.645 --> 12:22.405
I'm sorry, are you...?

12:22.485 --> 12:26.165
Are you offering to pay
to acquire my flesh?

12:26.765 --> 12:28.565
When you're dead. Jeez!

12:28.645 --> 12:31.125
You're making it sound so strange!

12:31.205 --> 12:34.485
It <i>is </i>strange! It's very strange!

12:34.565 --> 12:36.565
Anyway, who says I'm going to die first?

12:36.645 --> 12:37.725
Oof.

12:37.805 --> 12:38.845
Oh.

12:38.925 --> 12:43.525
Now, what figure would you put
on your corpse?

12:45.005 --> 12:47.445
And don't try to stiff me,
I'm not paying by the pound.

12:47.525 --> 12:50.125
Wow! You are cold!

12:50.205 --> 12:53.125
I'm going to make you an offer.
We'll go by the bank in the morning.

12:53.205 --> 12:56.605
I'll pay you in gold.
That'll be fun, won't it?

12:56.685 --> 12:58.925
Plus, it's good for me, no paper trail.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.765
Well, you don't have to worry
about a paper trail,

13:03.845 --> 13:06.325
because my answer is no!

13:07.565 --> 13:11.245
Ken Thompson's cadaver
is not for sale.

13:23.565 --> 13:24.565
Jesus!

13:25.725 --> 13:27.805
- How much?
-200 grand!

13:28.965 --> 13:31.205
And... run it by me again, you said...?

13:31.285 --> 13:33.965
It's an insult, thinking she can just
turn up here and buy me.

13:34.045 --> 13:35.605
Absolutely. It's terrible.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.725
I mean... you <i>would </i>be dead.

13:40.805 --> 13:43.885
I thought I was going to have a sister.
I thought we'd have a relationship.

13:43.965 --> 13:47.485
-Well, do you still want a relationship?
-Not after this!

13:47.565 --> 13:49.805
So what's the difference?
We'd just have to burn you anyway.

13:49.885 --> 13:52.605
I'm sorry, I hadn't stopped
to consider how inconvenient

13:52.685 --> 13:56.285
-not selling my corpse would be for you.
-Ken, think what we could do!

13:57.045 --> 14:00.765
We could take a year off, travel,

14:00.845 --> 14:02.485
build that conservatory.

14:03.165 --> 14:05.005
You would sell my body for a conservatory?

14:06.085 --> 14:07.365
Well...

14:08.045 --> 14:09.045
Really, Lorn.

14:12.045 --> 14:13.765
You could get a barge.

14:17.485 --> 14:18.925
A barge.

14:21.765 --> 14:23.445
So glad you saw sense.

14:23.525 --> 14:26.605
Well, you help me out, I help you out.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.645
It's just families
helping each other out, isn't it?

14:28.725 --> 14:30.965
Just admit it, you're greedy for the cash.

14:31.045 --> 14:33.245
Free money, you love it, don't you?

14:33.325 --> 14:35.965
No, I just know a good deal
when I see one.

14:37.205 --> 14:39.445
I bet I could get you to do anything.

14:40.285 --> 14:42.805
I'll give you £100
if you howl like a wolf.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.445
Well, that shows how much you know.

14:47.525 --> 14:48.805
Keep it.

14:50.965 --> 14:51.965
200.

14:53.245 --> 14:54.445
I'm fine, thanks.

14:55.245 --> 14:57.885
-300.
- No, thank you.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.925
-400.

15:00.005 --> 15:05.645
And that is my final offer,
and it better be one hell of a howl.

15:05.725 --> 15:06.645
Heh.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.285
Hello.

15:17.365 --> 15:21.165
Mrs Mittelfart, I have 400,000, in gold.

15:21.245 --> 15:23.765
-That's two each, I believe.

15:23.845 --> 15:26.605
Ah, I'm sorry.
I should just get this.

15:28.325 --> 15:29.645
-Go on, touch it.
-Hello.

15:29.725 --> 15:31.925
Touch your lovely gold.

15:36.725 --> 15:38.605
- So shiny.
-Mm.

15:38.685 --> 15:41.765
Well, I'll fetch the paperwork.
You make yourselves comfortable.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.925
-So, where are you headed to next?
-I don't know.

15:48.005 --> 15:50.645
Miami, Monaco, Dubai...

15:50.725 --> 15:53.005
-All of the places for twats.
-Oh, please!

15:53.085 --> 15:55.405
-I don't need your approval.

15:56.725 --> 15:58.925
Hello? Hi, David!

15:59.005 --> 16:00.245
Right.

16:00.845 --> 16:03.125
Got it! I'm going.

16:03.205 --> 16:04.925
-Grab the gold.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.165
-What?
-Grab the gold, man, and hurry!

16:09.325 --> 16:10.565
Um...

16:17.165 --> 16:19.605
-What the hell is going on?
-Nothing's going on.

16:19.685 --> 16:22.405
It's just that that room
was a little claustrophobic.

16:22.485 --> 16:23.685
Get in there.

16:28.205 --> 16:31.205
- What are you doing?
-OK, just don't overreact.

16:32.165 --> 16:35.525
That was our attorney on the phone,
and Ron's been arrested for fraud.

16:35.605 --> 16:37.485
Fraud? What kind of fraud?

16:37.565 --> 16:39.645
Some kind of bond scheme
he's been running for years

16:39.725 --> 16:42.125
involving certain
Ponzi-like accumulators.

16:42.205 --> 16:44.165
I just found out about it
for the first time.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.565
It was not that long a phone call.

16:46.645 --> 16:50.245
Quiet! They've frozen my assets
and I need that cash.

16:50.325 --> 16:52.765
You walk out with the gold,
I'll distract them.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.805
Absolutely not! That's theft!

16:54.885 --> 16:55.805
No, it's not.

16:55.885 --> 16:59.005
As far as they know,
we think the gold's still mine.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.805
And until they know we know it's not,
it's all innocent.

17:01.885 --> 17:04.485
I am not walking out of the bank.
They've got metal detectors.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.165
Didn't you take chemistry?

17:06.245 --> 17:09.845
Gold is a non-magnetic metal.
They can't detect it!

17:10.445 --> 17:11.765
Really?

17:11.845 --> 17:14.245
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I do remember that.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.165
Just think of the moolah, brother.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.445
Oh!
Hi, guys!

17:25.525 --> 17:26.685
What's up?

17:26.765 --> 17:30.285
You were gone so long, I thought
I would just take a look around!

17:30.365 --> 17:33.605
Mrs Mittelfart,
there's been an... irregularity.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.805
Might we step back into my office?

17:35.885 --> 17:37.765
It would be my pleasure, sir.

18:08.165 --> 18:09.205
I, um...

18:10.405 --> 18:12.805
I was just thinking one day,
I'd, erm,

18:12.885 --> 18:15.365
I'd really like to go
and look for some metal.

18:15.445 --> 18:17.805
You know,
with one of those metal detectors?

18:17.885 --> 18:19.525
Yeah. Sounds fun.

18:19.605 --> 18:21.005
-Yeah.
-Like searching for riches.

18:21.085 --> 18:23.125
Yeah, yeah, like buried treasure, yeah.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.325
Nice.

18:24.405 --> 18:25.605
But then...

18:26.325 --> 18:29.125
there'd be no point looking
for gold, would there? Cos...

18:29.725 --> 18:32.325
-it's not magnetic, is it?
-No.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.165
If it's not magnetic, no.
That makes sense. Yeah.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.685
OK, so I'd be wasting my time
looking for gold, wouldn't I?

18:38.765 --> 18:40.685
-Oh, God, yeah, wasting your time.
-Yeah.

18:43.845 --> 18:48.165
Although, right, they <i>must </i>have
found a way of detecting gold.

18:48.245 --> 18:49.565
Do you think?

18:50.645 --> 18:51.485
Yeah.

18:53.885 --> 18:56.565
This has been a wonderful conversation.

18:56.645 --> 18:58.445
We should talk again. I'd like that.

18:58.525 --> 19:00.485
Oh. No, no thanks.

19:00.565 --> 19:01.765
-Just...
-No, thanks.

19:17.045 --> 19:20.125
-Leave any bags here, sir?
- No, thank you, no bags.

19:20.205 --> 19:21.485
No bags.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.605
Thank you.

19:31.205 --> 19:32.685
What's going on?

19:34.205 --> 19:36.805
Oh, God, no! Help!

19:39.805 --> 19:42.125
I thought gold couldn't be detected
by these things.

19:43.405 --> 19:44.845
With it...

19:44.925 --> 19:46.325
not being magnetic.

19:47.405 --> 19:48.565
Right.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.645
Well, the machines detect gold.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.125
Right.

19:52.205 --> 19:53.765
Because we're a bank.

19:53.845 --> 19:55.325
With loads of gold in.

19:55.405 --> 19:57.285
No, that does make sense.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.965
I wasn't stealing, though.

20:01.045 --> 20:03.565
I genuinely, genuinely
thought it was mine.

20:04.205 --> 20:05.845
Genuinely.

20:09.445 --> 20:12.885
For some reason, my brother tried
to walk out of the bank with some gold.

20:13.565 --> 20:14.725
Yeah, they let him go.

20:15.325 --> 20:17.285
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?

20:18.285 --> 20:19.325
Ah!

20:21.525 --> 20:22.885
What am I gonna do?

20:22.965 --> 20:24.765
I have no money.

20:24.845 --> 20:28.045
I have <i>no money</i>!

20:30.365 --> 20:32.525
Oh, my God.

20:32.605 --> 20:35.445
-I am going to have to be ordinary.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.405
Like you.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.845
Waking up in the morning.
Making breakfast.

20:39.925 --> 20:42.845
-Listening to radio DJs.

20:42.925 --> 20:45.885
Smiling like it's not
the worst thing in the world.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.765
Ken, brother...

20:53.445 --> 20:56.125
Do you think I could stay with you
for a few months,

20:56.205 --> 20:58.085
just till I get back on my feet?

20:58.165 --> 21:01.325
Yeah, that's tempting
because, on one hand,

21:01.405 --> 21:03.565
you're a vain, fraudulent,
rude woman

21:03.645 --> 21:07.605
with no interest in me or my family
beyond what you can buy,

21:07.685 --> 21:10.645
and on the other hand,
I find you really annoying.

21:10.725 --> 21:11.925
Oh!

21:12.005 --> 21:15.485
-No, that is the same hand, isn't it?
-You could just say no.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.845
No.

21:16.925 --> 21:18.365
Fine.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.485
Tigran?

21:21.245 --> 21:22.365
Shit.

21:27.245 --> 21:30.085
-I was never sure about that conservatory.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.765
No? You were sure enough
to sell my body for it.

21:32.845 --> 21:34.445
Don't be like that.

21:34.525 --> 21:39.565
Just, if I ever DID lose you,
it would be nice to have somewhere to sit.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.285
I'm ready.

21:44.365 --> 21:45.325
Ah.

21:47.885 --> 21:50.205
I called the Uber, like you said.

21:51.525 --> 21:54.605
-So this is goodbye.
-OK, toodle-oo.

21:55.445 --> 21:59.045
The FBI will be waiting for me at JFK,
so...

22:00.645 --> 22:01.845
that'll be nice.

22:01.925 --> 22:05.085
Well, enjoy the interrogation.
Good luck with the waterboarding.

22:05.165 --> 22:06.685
It's meant to be horrible.

22:06.765 --> 22:07.605
Just so you know...

22:09.885 --> 22:12.885
I really did like meeting you all,

22:12.965 --> 22:15.205
even though it was for only one night.

22:15.285 --> 22:18.605
Ah! And that ploy failed entirely.

22:29.085 --> 22:31.485
Hey there. Airport, please.

22:32.725 --> 22:35.285
The airport it is, Ms Mittelfart.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.605
If you're thirsty,
there's my self-bottled spring water.

22:42.685 --> 22:46.205
-Anything else I can offer, please ask.

22:46.285 --> 22:47.445
And I mean

22:47.525 --> 22:48.565
anything.

22:51.925 --> 22:55.285
- Well, there she goes.
-I'm glad to see the back of her, frankly.

22:55.365 --> 22:57.485
The last thing we need
is another eccentric American
creating havoc in our lives.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.565
Come on.

23:03.845 --> 23:04.845
Huh?

23:19.925 --> 23:20.845
Of course.
