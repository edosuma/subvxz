00:02.250 --> 00:04.019

to be you.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.820
- It's just not right.

00:07.820 --> 00:09.260
To me, that's not love.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.900
- You wanna just crack
the door open a little?

00:13.900 --> 00:16.800
You'd be better off if you
just don't think about it

00:42.430 --> 00:44.330
Hi, Nev, how are you
this morning?

00:44.330 --> 00:45.290

- Yes!

00:46.430 --> 00:48.300
I have so many feelings

Thank you for asking.

- I am also he/him.

01:26.570 --> 01:27.970
- Oh, cool.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.310

Whoa, Daddy Nev,

You look more like a man.
- You do look older.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.480
Yeah, the baby has aged you.
<i> - Hold on, wait, let me--</i>

<i> We would say, like,</i>
<i> "I love you,"</i>

<i> so it was pretty serious.</i>

05:21.400 --> 05:24.240
- You spoke to Ryan
on the phone, though.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.440
<i> - Yes.</i>
- When did Tanner emerge?

05:26.440 --> 05:28.740

<i> "I wanna know, who are you?"</i>

Taylor's probably not real.

- You're going to college
next year.

07:36.170 --> 07:37.840
- Yes.
- How old is Tanner?

07:37.840 --> 07:39.940
- He's, like, 19 years old.
- You're not sure.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.710
- They told me 19.
- Who's they?

07:41.710 --> 07:44.080
- Well, him.
- "They" meaning Tanner/Ryan.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.150
- They, "Ryan," yeah.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.650
- iO gets hung up on pronouns.

07:46.650 --> 07:48.880
If Tanner identified
as a "they," then we'd be

07:48.890 --> 07:51.020
in a whole other universe.
- No.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.890
- Let's go back in time
five years ago.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.520
You were 13.

07:55.530 --> 07:57.460
- Yep, that's when me and him
started talking.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.030
- Okay.
- We were just texting

07:59.030 --> 08:01.030
all the time,
calling each other all the time.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.600
Like, we just
connected very well.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.930
I was getting bullied a lot.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.670
He understood
what I was going through.

08:06.670 --> 08:09.000
He was just able to,
like, comfort me

08:09.010 --> 08:12.240
in all of this and make me feel
a thousand times better.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.680
Like, it was just like my way
of escaping from the real world

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
by talking to him on the phone.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.810
Once we got to, like,
the two-year mark,

08:19.820 --> 08:23.680
it started getting, like, crazy
because he started to tell me

08:23.690 --> 08:25.790
almost every week
there was a new death

08:25.790 --> 08:27.690
in the family
or death of friends.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.290
<i> And it started getting</i>
<i> to the point where it was just,</i>

08:29.290 --> 08:30.660
<i> like, it's really weird.</i>

08:30.660 --> 08:33.929
- Okay, so then you asked
to video chat.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.760
- Yes.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.130
<i> It was pretty dark in the room.</i>

08:36.130 --> 08:38.700
<i> He had a hoodie on, long hair.</i>

08:38.700 --> 08:40.270
He kind of turned his face
a little bit,

08:40.270 --> 08:41.600
and I knew it wasn't Ryan.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.140
And so I panicked and hung up.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.870
He calls me right after
and was like, "Hey, I've been

08:46.880 --> 08:48.840
trying to get a hold of you,"
and I was like,

08:48.850 --> 08:50.480
"No, you haven't.
I have no missed calls.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.110
I just got off
of video chat with you."

08:52.120 --> 08:54.080
He's like, "Maybe someone, like,
hacked my account."

08:54.080 --> 08:57.420
And I said, "Look, I know you're
not the person in the pictures."

08:57.420 --> 09:00.150
- This is where Ryan
turns into Tanner?

09:00.160 --> 09:01.620
- [screeches]
- Yes.

09:01.620 --> 09:05.290
I was angry, confused,
but I also was scared

09:05.300 --> 09:08.800
to know the truth because
I was deeply in love with him.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.030
Like, for the remaining time
of us dating,

09:11.030 --> 09:13.330
I didn't want to think about it
myself even though it was

09:13.340 --> 09:15.640
in the back of my mind that he's
not the person he says he is.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.000
I still love the person.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.610
Who he looks like
doesn't have anything

09:19.610 --> 09:21.110
to do with his personality.

09:21.110 --> 09:24.450
- Okay, so I kind of wanna see
everything you got.

09:24.450 --> 09:26.810
Let's look at it
on a computer.

09:26.820 --> 09:27.620
All right.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.480
- You can sit down, sweetheart.

09:29.490 --> 09:31.050
- Oh, well, thank you, honey.

09:31.050 --> 09:33.190
- I'm a little older than you.
- All that gray.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.520
- Yep.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.790
- You wanna see
the pictures of Ryan first?

09:35.790 --> 09:37.290
- Yes, so that's Ryan.
- Yes.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.690
- So you've already been told
that that's not

09:39.700 --> 09:40.900
who you're talking to.
- Yeah.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.560
- Okay.
- Show us Tanner.

09:42.570 --> 09:44.470
- I have--This is a picture,
and that's supposedly him.

09:44.470 --> 09:48.470
- So he's holding a giant fish.
- He's holding a catfish!

09:48.470 --> 09:50.170
- Is that a catfish?
- That is a catfish.

09:50.170 --> 09:52.510
- He's telling you what's
going on right there.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.340
- Are you kidding me?
- He sent you a picture

09:54.340 --> 09:58.780
of a catfish!
- He's holding a catfish.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.350
Yeah, I don't know.
He looks like he's

10:00.350 --> 10:02.220
in his late teens, early 20s.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.880
What--What else do you have
to show us?

10:03.890 --> 10:07.360
Does Tanner have a page?
- Not from what I know of.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.560
Um, I have Ryan's older profile.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.230
- We know that Ryan is a fake.
- Yeah.

10:12.230 --> 10:15.000
- He said in 2012,
"I hope that my baby knows

10:15.000 --> 10:16.600
"that I love her
with all my heart.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.670
I love you, Mecca."

10:18.670 --> 10:21.740
Every single post is about you.
- Is dedicated to you.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.300
- [exclaiming]

10:23.310 --> 10:26.110
GBLTQ Support Group.
- Okay, I've never seen that.

10:26.110 --> 10:27.440
- Nice, nice find.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.380
What 14-year-old straight male
from Texas is part of

10:31.380 --> 10:33.610
a GBLTQ Support Group?
- Yeah.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.750
- Let's go to this chat group.

10:35.750 --> 10:40.350
- "GBLTQ Support Group."
People...

10:40.360 --> 10:42.760
- Oh, snap, you wrote something!

10:42.760 --> 10:45.130
"I love hot emo/scene guys!"

10:45.130 --> 10:48.630
- No, I actually never
wrote that, and that's weird.

10:48.630 --> 10:51.170
- "I'm sexy and I know it."
By you.

10:51.170 --> 10:52.230
- No.
- What?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.770
- Here.
- And you posted another one.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.400
Someone's been pretending
to be you.

10:55.410 --> 10:56.970
- Is that a picture of you?
- That's me.

10:56.970 --> 10:59.270
- And you didn't post that?
- No.

11:02.110 --> 11:03.640
- Someone's been
pretending to be you.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.910
- That a picture of you?
- That's me.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.880
- And you didn't post that?
- No.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.850
That's creepy.
- Is it--This is the first time

11:08.850 --> 11:10.150
you're seeing this?
- Yeah.

11:10.150 --> 11:12.620
- That four years ago,
he posted as you.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.820
- He did have my info, though,
on my Facebook.

11:15.830 --> 11:17.490
- You gave him your password.
- Yeah.

11:17.490 --> 11:18.790
- What?
- 'Cause we were like,

11:18.800 --> 11:20.230
"Oh, trust, blah, blah, blah."

11:20.230 --> 11:21.830
- Why give him your password
in the first place?

11:21.830 --> 11:23.900
- I was young.
- So he signed in

11:23.900 --> 11:25.830
to her account and wrote it
from your account.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.400
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.840
- Why would he go on and pretend
to be you on a gay group?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.470
- That's--There's another one.
- Whoa.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.110
- This is really disturbing.
- Yeah, this is trippy.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.950
- All right, there's a lot...
- Wow.

11:38.950 --> 11:41.980
- Of weird stuff going on.
- I know, my head's spinning.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.650
- Put this all in an email,
send it to us,

11:44.650 --> 11:46.820
and we'll do our work,
and we'll get back to you.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.920
- All right.
- Oy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy.

11:48.930 --> 11:51.130
- Ah.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.360
- Oh, boy.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.930
- That was weird.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.060
- She's smart, but she does not
want to see the truth.

11:56.070 --> 11:58.570
- Right, this guy
is pretending to be Mecca

11:58.570 --> 12:03.470
in a gay, lesbian Facebook
group, so that would say,

12:03.470 --> 12:06.410
"Oh, well, maybe he's a gay guy
who's in the closet

12:06.410 --> 12:08.040
who wants to explore--"
- Why then wouldn't he

12:08.040 --> 12:10.310
just create a Facebook account
as a girl

12:10.310 --> 12:12.950
and go live on the Internet?
- Right.

12:12.950 --> 12:14.550
<i> We'll get the answers.</i>

12:14.550 --> 12:17.520
<i> [ominous music]</i>

12:17.520 --> 12:19.150
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

12:19.160 --> 12:21.520
- I feel like we're
Sherlock and Watson.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.860
- Welcome to my life.

12:22.860 --> 12:25.160
- Table for two, please.
- Two.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.890
- Cool, thank you.
- Cool, thank you so much.

12:26.900 --> 12:30.000
- All right, so I get to be
at the control today,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.330
and you get to film.
- Max, you've been waiting

12:32.340 --> 12:34.170
a long time for this moment.
- I have been.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.640
I'm breaking through
the glass ceiling.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.100
- Through a hairy,
black glass ceiling.

12:37.110 --> 12:39.070
- Uh-huh, you're on film detail.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.640
So we've got info here.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.780
"Hey, Max and iO, thank you
so much for meeting/helping me.

12:43.780 --> 12:47.150
Below is the information I have
for Ryan, Tanner, and Taylor."

12:47.150 --> 12:50.020
We have a phone number,
a Facebook page for Taylor,

12:50.020 --> 12:51.250
and then we have photos.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.590
Why don't we do
the photos first.

12:52.590 --> 12:53.620
- Okay.
- So let's run

12:53.620 --> 12:55.290
these Ryan images.
- Okay.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.790
- Here we go.
We're gonna get something.

12:57.790 --> 13:00.360
Oh, nothing's coming up.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.730
Let me try this one.

13:02.730 --> 13:05.030
- Wait...
- No, nothing.

13:05.030 --> 13:08.770
- Here's the picture of Tanner.
Are we gonna get something?

13:08.770 --> 13:09.940
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

13:09.940 --> 13:11.270
- Nothing for Tanner.
- Okay.

13:11.270 --> 13:13.040
- So we struck out
on the pictures.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.780
Let's go to Ryan's page.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.340
- We looked yesterday.

13:16.350 --> 13:18.980
All right, this is
clearly a fake.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.950
Whoever this person is admitted
this Ryan Wilson is a fake.

13:21.950 --> 13:24.490
- Right, so this
will do nothing.

13:24.490 --> 13:27.990
- Okay, I'm gonna say also
this is a crazy thing.

13:27.990 --> 13:30.830
Like, she said that she gave
her Facebook login info

13:30.830 --> 13:33.630
to her boyfriend
who she's never met.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.960
Okay, sorry, I know,
I'm in the "Catfish" universe.

13:35.970 --> 13:38.170
- This is what the kids do.
- The kids need--

13:38.170 --> 13:40.230
Stop doing that!
- Instead of exchanging

13:40.240 --> 13:42.300
bodily fluids, you exchange--
- You exchange passwords?

13:42.310 --> 13:45.170
- Facebook passwords.
- Well, that's really gross.

13:45.170 --> 13:48.540
- All right, so Taylor
was the person who originally

13:48.540 --> 13:51.210
reached out to Mecca...
- And connected her with Ryan.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.510
- And connected her,
so it all started with Taylor.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.120
- Mm-hmm, we don't even know
if Taylor is a real person.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.890
- So let's go to Taylor's
Facebook page.

13:58.890 --> 14:01.120
All right, let's
look at her photos.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.320
- That's it?
- All right, so she hasn't

14:02.330 --> 14:04.260
posted any other
pictures of herself,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.160
which would either lead me
to believe that she's

14:06.160 --> 14:10.000
just really private or is
maybe a little insecure.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.170
- I'm gonna go with the latter.

14:12.170 --> 14:14.170
"Hey, I just got a call.
I need you to replace

14:14.170 --> 14:15.370
a shift at work.
Call me when you can."

14:15.370 --> 14:17.200
That's from somebody else
to her.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.740
- To her, it's posted
as of yesterday.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.040
- So that means
she's a real person.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.240
- So--That she knows her
in real life.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.740
- Yeah.
- Where is this person?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.910
Lakeisha.
- Lives in Abilene, Texas.

14:24.910 --> 14:29.020
- Abilene, so let's send
Lakeisha a message.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.460
So I just sent that to her.
- Cool.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.730
- What we haven't done yet
is run the phone number.

14:43.730 --> 14:44.730
- Ooh.
- Phone number's

14:44.730 --> 14:46.300
always the clincher.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.340
So let's go to--
Why aren't you filming?

14:49.340 --> 14:51.310
- Oh, my God, sorry.
I forgot.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.040
- You're blanking on your job.
- Sorry, I forgot I was you.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.210
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- That's strike one.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.650
- [laughs]
- Let's run it.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.550
- Run it, run it.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.020
- All right, here we go.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.620
Oh, no name, but look at this,
Brownwood, Texas.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.920
[phone ringing]

15:04.920 --> 15:07.790
Wait, we're getting a call.
Oh, boy.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.790
Hello?

15:09.790 --> 15:11.860
- Yes, who is this?

15:11.860 --> 15:13.590
- Hey, Lakeisha.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.900
I'm here with my substitution
for Nev on this episode, iO.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.500
- Hi.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.740
- We're doing an episode
right now, and we've been

15:21.740 --> 15:26.110
kind of doing some research
on Taylor [bleep], and...

15:29.680 --> 15:31.510
- How old is she?

15:31.510 --> 15:34.450
- 19, does Taylor
have a boyfriend?

15:40.960 --> 15:42.660
- One more question,
have you ever heard

15:42.660 --> 15:45.830
of Ryan or Tanner Wilson?

15:51.670 --> 15:54.770
- Well, look, you've been
very helpful, and I hope

15:54.770 --> 15:57.540
you have a lovely day.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.440
- Bye.

15:59.440 --> 16:05.380
- Okay, I feel like maybe we
should just reach out to Taylor.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.210
- Let's do it.
- Surprise!

16:07.220 --> 16:12.150
- We are helping Mecca meet up--
- With your cousin.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.460
Sent.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.460
- I feel like Taylor's not gonna
call us because Taylor's

16:17.460 --> 16:19.630
phone number's gonna be the same
as Tanner's phone number,

16:19.630 --> 16:21.100
so we should save
his phone number.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.560
- Unless she blocks it.
You're right.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.800
That's Tanner Wilson.
- The other--

16:24.800 --> 16:27.770
- Oh, my God, I just had a
really frightening realization.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.300
- What?
- I'm gonna have to

16:29.310 --> 16:32.240
call the catfish.
I don't wanna call that person.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.640
- Nev is really good at that.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.740
- I can do it.
- Great.

16:34.740 --> 16:35.980
[phone ringing]

16:35.980 --> 16:38.210
- Oh, oh, boy.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.210
- Tanner Wilson is calling,
and the only way

16:40.220 --> 16:42.020
that Tanner Wilson would call
is if Tanner Wilson

16:42.020 --> 16:43.580
is Taylor and the catfish.

16:43.590 --> 16:44.550
Hello?
- Hello?

16:47.320 --> 16:48.720
- Oh!
- Tanner Wilson is calling

16:48.720 --> 16:50.360
and the only way
that Tanner Wilson would call

16:50.360 --> 16:53.130
is if Tanner Wilson
is Taylor and the catfish.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.430
Hello?
- Hello?

16:55.430 --> 16:56.830
- Hi, who's this?

16:58.800 --> 17:02.300
- Hey, Tanner, how did you
get our number?

17:03.710 --> 17:07.810
- Your cousin Taylor
gave you our number.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.079
Cool.

17:18.119 --> 17:23.390
- Okay, okay, that's--
I think that she might be

17:23.390 --> 17:25.290
expecting that,
and she might be

17:25.290 --> 17:29.200
more understanding about that
than you think.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.500
- Look, Mecca knows
that something is up, and,

17:33.500 --> 17:35.870
after years of sending her
pictures of the people

17:35.870 --> 17:38.470
that are not necessarily you,
you owe it to her

17:38.470 --> 17:40.870
to tell her the truth in person.

17:48.380 --> 17:51.620
- Sure, you have our number,
let us know what you think.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.660
- Thanks, Tanner.
- All right.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.890
Tanner's a girl.
- Uh, I think Tanner is trans.

17:58.890 --> 18:04.000
I think Tanner is Taylor,
and then identifies as Tanner.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.870
And that's why Tanner is such
a similar name to Taylor.

18:06.870 --> 18:08.070
- To Taylor.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.570
- I call somebody,
I have a girl's voice,

18:10.570 --> 18:12.840
and I say that I'm a he.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.170
- You could be right.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.980
- I think we just have to
go over and prepare Mecca

18:16.980 --> 18:20.280
for the possibility that this
is a girl or that this

18:20.280 --> 18:22.850
is a trans person
and see what she says.

18:22.850 --> 18:24.350
- All right.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.990
<i> [phone ringing]</i>

18:25.990 --> 18:27.650
- Hey, Mecca, it's iO and Max.

18:27.660 --> 18:30.320
We're wondering if you
wanted to meet up.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.030
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

18:37.030 --> 18:39.470
- I know that you've been doing
this for six seasons,

18:39.470 --> 18:42.840
but, for me, being inside
of "Catfish" for the first time,

18:42.840 --> 18:46.370
it just breaks my heart
that people have to resort

18:46.380 --> 18:48.640
to creating multiple identities
for themselves

18:48.640 --> 18:50.510
because they've been told
who they really are

18:50.510 --> 18:53.050
is not enough
and that sucks.

18:53.050 --> 18:55.250
- Yeah, oh, there's truck!
- Oh, there's the truck!

18:55.250 --> 18:57.220
- There it is.
Get the--film that!

18:57.220 --> 18:58.550
- God!

18:58.550 --> 19:01.050
- When things happen,
you gotta film it.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.920
All right, let's get some food.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.330
Look at this Hot Mess
in front of us.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.460
- Ay-o!
- Mecca and family.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.660
- How you doing?
- Wow.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.430
Your hair matches the truck!
- Hi!

19:09.430 --> 19:11.000
- Right, I'm that girl.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.670
- You are that girl.
- Oh, yeah, you're that girl.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.100
- Hi, I'm Max.
- How you doing?

19:14.100 --> 19:15.540
Max, Heather.
- Hey, Heather,

19:15.540 --> 19:16.940
nice to meet you.
- Hey, iO, nice to meet you.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.140
- iO.
- Hey, Damion.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.340
- Hey, Damion.
- Um, can we eat?

19:19.340 --> 19:20.770
- Yeah, get in there.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.980
- Okay, here's some Mexi.
- Yeah!

19:22.980 --> 19:24.680
- What are we working with here?
- That's the Mexi Tots.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.080
- How is it, Max?
- Wow, that is good.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.920
So we did some investigation.
We found some things.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.190
- Okay.
- Mom, if you want to join...

19:35.190 --> 19:37.690
- 100%.
- Dad, someone has to...

19:37.690 --> 19:39.490
- Clean the truck.
- Hold down the fort.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.430
- Right?
- Let's do it.

19:43.430 --> 19:47.570
- So, Heather, what do you know?

19:47.570 --> 19:50.870
- Well, five years ago,
she was 13 years old.

19:50.870 --> 19:54.640
I felt like to have
a boyfriend so far away,

19:54.640 --> 19:56.380
that it was less of a threat,
you know?

19:56.380 --> 20:00.380
Like, he lives in Texas, or,
you know, like, it'll be good.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.550
But I felt honestly like
this person has lied

20:02.550 --> 20:04.250
about so many things.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.050
- I've trusted him,
and he could be just like

20:06.060 --> 20:08.790
catfishing other people
using my profile.

20:08.790 --> 20:13.160
That is way bigger to me,
honestly, that you used me

20:13.160 --> 20:14.700
to do this to other people.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.660
- It's one thing to kind of
be lied to, and then

20:16.670 --> 20:19.130
it's another thing to be used.
- Yeah.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.100
- Honestly, I just want her
to get her answers.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.870
This is my job, right here.

20:24.870 --> 20:26.670
- So come over here.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.210
We did a bunch of research.

20:28.210 --> 20:31.650
The first thing we did
was we searched pictures.

20:31.650 --> 20:33.680
- Okay.
- And we found nothing,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.620
which doesn't mean anything.
We know that Ryan

20:36.620 --> 20:38.290
is not the person
you've been talking to.

20:38.290 --> 20:39.550
- Yeah.
- Now the question is,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.020
is Tanner <i> Tanner?</i>
- Yeah.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.720
- So then, we looked
into Taylor [bleep].

20:43.730 --> 20:47.490
We went down her timeline.
We saw this from two days ago.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.500
"Hey, just got a call.
I need you to replace

20:49.500 --> 20:51.370
a shift at work."
But this person,

20:51.370 --> 20:53.130
Lakeisha, seems to know her.

20:53.140 --> 20:58.910
We spoke to Lakeisha.
She said she works with Taylor.

20:58.910 --> 21:01.240
- Okay.
- In Brownwood, Texas.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.080
So Taylor's a real girl.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.080
Taylor talks a lot
about her cousins.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.780
- Who are boys.
- Okay.

21:09.790 --> 21:13.420
- But, we decided
to message Taylor, just thought,

21:13.420 --> 21:15.720
"Oh, well, maybe Taylor
will reach out to us."

21:15.720 --> 21:18.690
The phone rang, it was Tanner.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.860
- We spoke to Tanner,
and we heard his voice.

21:21.860 --> 21:28.200
It sounded unisex,
but we don't know at this point.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.570
- We tried to encourage Tanner
to meet up with you,

21:32.570 --> 21:35.910
and he said that he was scared.

21:35.910 --> 21:40.650
So I asked him why, and he said,
"Well, because the person

21:40.650 --> 21:43.620
in the pictures is not me."

21:43.620 --> 21:46.290
<i> - ♪ We're starting over ♪</i>

21:46.290 --> 21:50.960
- "But I am Tanner," he said.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.490
- I really hope that there
is a Tanner

21:53.500 --> 21:55.100
that I've been talking to.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.660
- As in, there's a guy
that you've been talking to

21:57.670 --> 22:00.300
or that there's
a guy named Tanner, person?

22:00.300 --> 22:03.400
- A guy named Tanner
that I've been talking to.

22:03.410 --> 22:05.310
<i> - ♪ Do you love me? ♪</i>

22:05.310 --> 22:07.470
- 'Cause if I can't get this,
then I can't talk to him

22:07.480 --> 22:09.480
because it hurts me even more.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.280
<i> - ♪ Because you'll never know ♪</i>

22:11.280 --> 22:15.750
<i> ♪ You'll never know, </i>
<i> oh, what you really mean ♪</i>

22:15.750 --> 22:17.520
- She needs her answers.
She deserves it.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.020
This person has a lot
of explaining to do.

22:20.020 --> 22:25.830
<i> - ♪ 'Cause who you love's me ♪</i>

22:29.570 --> 22:31.830
- All right, I think
there's a possibility

22:31.830 --> 22:36.070
that Tanner is Taylor
and was born a girl

22:36.070 --> 22:39.970
but is transgender
and has to live as Taylor.

22:39.980 --> 22:44.210
Another possibility is that
Tanner is a complete fabrication

22:44.210 --> 22:47.750
and Taylor is a lesbian
and is scared to tell you that.

22:47.750 --> 22:52.290
- Or Tanner is Taylor's cousin
and is insecure

22:52.290 --> 22:54.320
because of how he looks.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.330
We don't know at this point,
but we at least have narrowed

22:58.330 --> 23:01.230
our search down
to Brownwood, Texas.

23:01.230 --> 23:02.760
We know where Taylor works.

23:02.770 --> 23:04.300
We know the address
that the phone number

23:04.300 --> 23:05.830
is connected to.

23:05.830 --> 23:09.640
- We could go to Brownwood
and show up at this place.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.740
- We could probably figure out
who this person is.

23:13.740 --> 23:16.340
- I just--I feel like I really
need to meet this person.

23:16.350 --> 23:20.010
I need to see who the person is
and get the answers that I need.

23:20.020 --> 23:23.380
- Pack a bag, and tomorrow
we leave for Dallas.

23:23.390 --> 23:25.790
- Can she go with?
- Do you wanna come?

23:25.790 --> 23:27.620
- Most definitely, I wanna
be there for my daughter.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.420
- Mom wants to come.
- Sean, do we have room?

23:30.430 --> 23:31.530
- Great.
You ready?

23:31.530 --> 23:32.890
I'm ready.
- All right.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.360
Let's do it.
- We're gonna get you

23:34.360 --> 23:37.030
some answers.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.470
[phone pings]

23:38.470 --> 23:41.740
- Oh, okay, so I just got
a text from Tanner.

23:41.740 --> 23:43.470
I'm gonna write back.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.080
Okay.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.080
[phone pings]

23:54.080 --> 23:55.250
Oh.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.720
Got something, what'd they say?

23:56.720 --> 23:57.680
"Okay."

23:57.690 --> 23:59.090
They said, "Okay."

23:59.090 --> 24:00.750
All right, so I'm gonna
go downstairs so we can

24:00.760 --> 24:02.060
have this phone call.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.390
All right, so heading
to the PO now.

24:04.390 --> 24:05.760
That's the production office.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.530
We always have
a production office

24:07.530 --> 24:09.160
in every hotel we stay in.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.360
That's where the crew
is gonna be.

24:11.370 --> 24:12.500
That's where they are now.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.100
Just joking around
and not working.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.640
- Aww, man.
- Aww.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.210
- Okay.
- Is he calling us,

24:18.210 --> 24:20.110
or are we calling him?
- No, we're gonna call him.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.140
I think I'm more nervous
than he is.

24:22.140 --> 24:25.580
<i> - You have reached the</i>
<i> voicemail box of--</i>

24:26.820 --> 24:30.550

24:30.550 --> 24:32.050

Oh, I'm ready.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.330

- This has never happened
on our show.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.670
- You ready?
- FaceTime, yes,

24:48.670 --> 24:52.070
oh, I'm ready, oh, my God.

24:52.070 --> 24:53.910
- Hello?

24:53.910 --> 24:56.010
- Can you see us?

24:56.010 --> 24:59.610
- We can only see
your nose and mouth.

24:59.620 --> 25:03.280
- Can we see your face?

25:03.290 --> 25:09.760
- Look, we've gone over certain
possibilities with Mecca.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.320
We've talked about
the strong possibility

25:11.330 --> 25:15.730
that you're a girl
or that you could even be--

25:19.870 --> 25:22.440
- Okay, well,
that conversation's over.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.440
- Look, Mecca's
ready for anything.

25:24.440 --> 25:29.610
She's ready for you to be a boy,
a girl, Donald Trump, whoever,

25:29.610 --> 25:31.580
as long as it is the truth.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.920
- Right on, Tanner.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.290
- I think that's probably
the best way to look at this,

25:42.290 --> 25:45.360
and the way that you'll be able
to actually face

25:45.360 --> 25:46.690
the moment and do it.

25:46.700 --> 25:50.830
Where should I tell her
we're going?

25:50.830 --> 25:56.570
- Will you text us a place
to meet tomorrow afternoon?

25:56.570 --> 25:58.410
- Well, Tanner, thank you
for doing this.

25:58.410 --> 26:00.410
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

26:00.410 --> 26:01.680
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.010
- All right.

26:05.450 --> 26:07.350
- Yeah, I've never been--

26:07.350 --> 26:10.350
- But I think this catfish
wants to get caught.

26:10.350 --> 26:12.120
That person was female for sure.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.820
- We don't know.
It could be someone

26:13.820 --> 26:15.790
who's confused.
It could be someone--

26:15.790 --> 26:20.430
Whatever it is, they are down

37:21.060 --> 37:25.190
- I'm sorry, I just--
I was scared,

37:25.190 --> 37:29.230
but most of everything
that I told you is true.

37:29.230 --> 37:32.600
- Okay, but here's the thing,
right, you used Mecca

37:32.600 --> 37:34.500
to go on to this group
and post as her.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.540
- I know, there's no excuse
for me to do that, you know?

37:36.540 --> 37:38.500
Like, I shouldn't have done that
and that was wrong of me.

37:38.510 --> 37:41.340
I was scared that people were
gonna find out that I was gay,

37:41.340 --> 37:46.080
and where I come from, it's--
people don't really accept that.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.080
Going on Facebook, and then
just talking to other people

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
as Mecca was, like,
so much easier.

37:51.090 --> 37:54.050
- But, like,
you portrayed me as gay.

37:54.060 --> 37:57.720
- Yeah.
- And, like, that--

37:57.730 --> 38:00.530
that's not right.

38:00.530 --> 38:02.360
I would've helped you
through some of that,

38:02.360 --> 38:05.200
and I wish that you could've
just been honest with me.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.070
- It's just, you know,
being scared, you know,

38:07.070 --> 38:08.830
like, "What will she do?
What will she say?

38:08.840 --> 38:11.400
What will her expression be?"
You know?

38:11.410 --> 38:14.170
'Cause there's something in you,
it's like a spark.

38:14.180 --> 38:17.840
There's something in you
that I can't get away from.

38:22.020 --> 38:24.950
- There is going to be
somebody in your life

38:24.950 --> 38:29.220
who is going to love you as you,
who is gay, who wants

38:29.220 --> 38:31.490
to be with you in that way,
who's gonna make you feel

38:31.490 --> 38:33.260
many of the things
that Mecca made you feel--

38:33.260 --> 38:35.490
- I know.
- Because your job

38:35.500 --> 38:38.630
is to take the risk
of being your authentic self

38:38.630 --> 38:41.430
with people,
but you've gotta let them decide

38:41.440 --> 38:43.570
if they wanna love you.

38:43.570 --> 38:47.910
- We're gonna step away,
so get what you need.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.110
- I'm willing to work with it.

38:51.110 --> 38:54.480
I'm willing to work with you
to earn your trust back.

38:54.480 --> 38:59.220
You know, I've had many people
come and go throughout my life,

38:59.220 --> 39:01.190
but one thing
that I would hate to see

39:01.190 --> 39:03.520
is for you to come and go.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.360
I would love for you
to come and stay.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.900
- But, like, obviously, you know
that, like, I'm straight.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.970
I don't like girls,
but I would like

39:12.970 --> 39:15.600
something positive out of this.

39:15.600 --> 39:19.570
- I just don't want us
to, like, lose contact.

39:19.570 --> 39:24.410
- Hey, we decided that
we're gonna take some time

39:24.410 --> 39:27.010
for ourselves
and maybe reconnect

39:27.010 --> 39:29.150
sometime in the future.

39:29.150 --> 39:32.050
- All right, thank you for--
- Thank you.

39:32.050 --> 39:35.550
- Coming out and being honest.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.690
- I'm gonna go.
