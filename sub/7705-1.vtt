<i> (Willie)</i>
<i> This is the way it began</i>
<i> that extraordinary night.</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:08.607
<i> The night he came.</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:11.810
I'm gonna be in the garage,
calling Bochev.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.812
Me too!
Who's Bochev?

00:13.814 --> 00:15.748
Bochev is my friend
in Yugoslavia.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.687
Dad, can I look
through the telescope?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.423
Of course, my son,
enjoy the cosmos.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.997
Dad, can I talk to Natalie,
after you're through?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.298
Sure.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.700
I wanna tell her
about my new boyfriend.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.636
New boyfriend?
What's his name?

00:37.638 --> 00:40.806
- Lash.
- "Lash?"

00:40.808 --> 00:43.475
That's not his real name, is it?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.311
You don't approve, do you?

00:46.313 --> 00:48.747
I don't even know...Lash.

00:50.151 --> 00:55.087
This is K-7-2-6-X-A-A,
Los Angeles calling Belgrade.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.258
- How are you guys doing?
- Fine, dad hates Lash.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.026
And I'm looking for Venus.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.394
Did you find it?

01:02.396 --> 01:05.998
No, but the neighbors are
watching "Body Heat" again.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.667
Brian.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.669
Stop spying on people.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.207
- Just get ready for bed.
- I'm hungry.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.543
Well, that's because you didn't
eat your mash potatoes.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.545
I don't like mash potatoes.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.113
Come on.
Did anyone feed the cat?

01:21.115 --> 01:25.084
- 'Oh, I'll feed him.'
- Feed him my mash<i> potatoes.</i>

01:25.086 --> 01:26.552
Lucky eats cat food.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.455
Now, I know
why we named him Lucky.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.293
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.527
Sure.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.895
- Oh!
- Hoo!

01:36.897 --> 01:39.031
- Darn!
- You alright?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.433
Yeah, I guess the CB
must've crossed circuits

01:41.435 --> 01:42.801
with the short wave.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.804
You know, it's not easy
being a 16-year-old.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.373
[sighs]
I know, I'm immature
sometimes..

01:48.375 --> 01:50.909
- You know, you put so much--
- I was talking about Lynn.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.578
Lynn! Right.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.580
[sighs]
Was there a problem there?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.482
She thinks
you hate her boyfriend.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.684
Such-such a bright girl.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.588
I-I'll talk to her.
Right away.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.056
We will get this thing
straightened out.

02:04.058 --> 02:06.091
Let me just, let me just
shut this thing off.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.160
[machine beeping]

02:08.162 --> 02:09.428
What's that noise?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.996
[beeping continues]

02:13.167 --> 02:14.600
Oh, my gosh.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.802
It's the infrared radio band.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.937
I've locked into
something in space

02:18.939 --> 02:21.440
a pulsar or a, or a satellite.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.308
[beeping continues]

02:23.310 --> 02:28.580
Hello? Hello? This is
K-7-2-6-X-A-A. Can you read me?

02:28.582 --> 02:31.116
[speaking in alien language]

02:31.118 --> 02:33.652
They're answering, but I don't
recognize the language.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.088
Why don't you
just shut it off?

02:36.090 --> 02:38.624
I, I can't.
I, I can't control it.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.125
It's locked in on a signal.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.161
[beeping continues]

02:42.163 --> 02:45.264
Willie, Willie, what's that?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.632
Oh, my gosh!

02:46.634 --> 02:49.134
It can't be.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.870
The lights! What happened
to the lights?

02:51.872 --> 02:54.473
Daddy, daddy,
what's that thing in the sky?

02:54.475 --> 02:57.176
- What's going on?
- It's closing in fast.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.944
I think maybe we better..

02:58.946 --> 03:00.279
[crash]

03:09.056 --> 03:11.623
[engine humming]

03:11.625 --> 03:14.059
We...we have a visitor.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.265
[theme music]

03:51.198 --> 03:54.166
[music continues]

04:20.728 --> 04:23.061
- Here he comes! Here he comes!
- Brian, stay with me.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.064
Oh, my gosh!
It's hairy!

04:26.066 --> 04:29.034
- Let's put it over here.
- Not on the couch!

04:29.036 --> 04:31.637
Lynn, clear off
the coffee table.

04:31.639 --> 04:35.340
- Quick! It's heavy.
- Heavy and hairy!

04:40.080 --> 04:41.647
[gasps]

04:49.423 --> 04:51.556
I can't believe it.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.492
What do you think it is?

04:53.494 --> 04:56.128
A real<i> alien.</i>

04:56.130 --> 04:57.763
Willie..

04:57.765 --> 05:00.332
Willie, what is it?

05:00.334 --> 05:02.301
I don't know.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.936
Brian's right. It's an ALF.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.972
- What?
- An ALF.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.108
An A-L-F. That's short
for "Alien life form."

05:10.110 --> 05:13.845
- Can ALF stay in my room?
-<i> No!</i>

05:13.847 --> 05:15.747
No, this thing is
not staying in anyone's..

05:15.749 --> 05:16.982
It's not<i> staying! </i>

05:16.984 --> 05:19.685
Why not? E.T. got to stay.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.754
E.T. was a movie.
This is real.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.823
This is on our coffee table.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.261
This is incredible.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.129
Truly amazing.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.031
After all those
years of wondering

05:33.033 --> 05:35.300
and hoping
that it might be possible

05:35.302 --> 05:37.102
to contact alien life

05:37.104 --> 05:40.105
to have this happen,
it's a miracle.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.207
It's the fulfillment
of a lifelong dream.

05:42.209 --> 05:45.811
- We've got to get rid of it.
- Absolutely.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.279
We don't know
anything about it.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.848
It could be dangerous.
It could be diseased.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.950
It could be hostile
or have hostile friends

05:51.952 --> 05:54.486
'or acquaintances.
It could be anything.'

05:54.488 --> 05:57.956
'You mother's right. We'd better
report it to the authorities.'

05:57.958 --> 06:01.059
But what if the authorities
do something to it?

06:01.061 --> 06:04.296
Yeah, what if they
poke needles in it?

06:04.298 --> 06:07.866
No, they wouldn't
poke needles in it.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.501
Would they, Willie?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.903
Well, they could.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.640
I don't think they would
but they could.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.776
And...they might.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.847
I know this's very exciting,
but I don't see any alternative.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.849
We've got to report this!

06:23.851 --> 06:25.183
What other choice
do we have?

06:25.185 --> 06:28.587
Argh! Ah, can I make
a suggestion?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.389
Yeah, sure, why not..

06:31.425 --> 06:34.359
Well, if it's not
too much trouble..

06:34.361 --> 06:36.828
[grunts]

06:36.830 --> 06:39.231
...how about fixing
my spaceship?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.770
<i> Hello!</i> Read my lips.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.873
It talks.

06:47.875 --> 06:52.444
It's heavy, it's hairy
and it talks.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.280
Good, now,
how about fixing my spaceship

06:55.282 --> 07:00.018
so I can get my heavy,
hairy body<i> out</i> of here?

07:02.556 --> 07:06.792
Uh, I-I'm not sure
I can fix your spaceship.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.060
I mean, not tonight,
not-not in the dark.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.696
Yeah, you could use
a light in that driveway.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.399
You know, I've been meaning
the put one out there, but..

07:14.401 --> 07:16.802
You know how it is, you get busy
with one thing and another.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.236
- Willie!
- I'm sorry.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.739
- It just seems so<i> human! </i>
- Hey!

07:20.741 --> 07:22.507
There's no need
for name-calling.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.878
I don't think we should
get too friendly, Willie.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.447
She's right.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.648
Let's have a snack now.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.716
We'll get friendly later.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.085
Snack?
What-what kind of a snack?

07:34.087 --> 07:37.255
- You got a cat?
- You eat cats?

07:37.257 --> 07:39.925
- You can't eat Lucky.
- No, no cat eating.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.760
- Not in this house.
- Alright, alright.

07:41.762 --> 07:45.597
How about a cat-food can?
I could use the roughage.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.899
Can we give ALF a can, mom?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.168
- Please?
-<i> Please?</i>

07:51.605 --> 07:53.638
Alright.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.973
A dented one.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.043
Come on, ALF.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.946
We're going with you.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.114
Trusts me about
as far as she can throw me.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.418
That is amazing.
Isn't that<i> amazing?</i>

08:06.420 --> 08:08.987
Willie, will you come down
to Earth for a minute?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.790
An alien being has come
to live with us

08:11.792 --> 08:14.459
and eat our cans
and snack on our cat.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.661
(ALF)
'Yeah, this will do fine.'

08:16.663 --> 08:18.997
[munching]

08:20.868 --> 08:24.302
Alright. Alright.
Just give me one day, okay?

08:24.304 --> 08:27.439
If I can't get ALF going,
we'll tell somebody.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.374
Just<i> one</i> day.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.609
[Kate sighs]

08:31.645 --> 08:32.978
Okay.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.546
[Lucky snarls]

08:36.016 --> 08:38.517
He's quick!
I'll give him that.

[alarm buzzing]

08:54.301 --> 08:56.167
Mm. Morning.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.836
Morning.

[screaming]

09:00.007 --> 09:02.941
- Willie!
- Willie!

09:05.846 --> 09:09.481
- What's going on out there?
- Nothin'. Just screaming.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.385
- Move out of the way.
- No problem.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.523
[sighs]
Let me put it this way, Willie.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.026
I don't think
this is going to work out.

09:21.028 --> 09:24.029
I'll take care of this.
Everything's fine.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.964
Everything's under control.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.669
[toilet flushing]

09:33.740 --> 09:35.707
Interesting concept.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.176
Please, come away
from there. Come, come on.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.045
Come on!
Over, over here by me.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.713
We've a little problem
we have to discuss.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.716
Yeah, Lynn and I got
to gabbing last night

09:44.718 --> 09:46.184
and she sort of feels..

09:47.588 --> 09:49.454
Boy, you're blind as a bat,
aren't you?

09:49.456 --> 09:50.889
Would you give those
to me, please?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.490
No problem.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.194
You must understand

09:56.196 --> 09:58.597
that Kate is very nervous

09:58.599 --> 09:59.698
about this whole thing.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.867
Absolutely. Who's Kate?

10:02.869 --> 10:06.571
- My wife.
- Oh, yeah. She snores.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.940
- She doesn't snore.
- You calling me a liar?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.376
You just keep
your distance, alright?

10:11.378 --> 10:14.346
- And try to be considerate.
- No problem.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.715
That is not considerate.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.117
That is...the<i> opposite</i>
of considerate.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.653
That is<i> inconsiderate!</i>

10:21.655 --> 10:23.822
Look, look,
let's just, uh..

10:23.824 --> 10:25.290
Let's just settle down here.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.258
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.294
No, there's no need
for you to shave.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.964
- You look fine.
- I wanna do everything you do.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.499
You're my idol.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.672
I'm.. I'm going to
take a shower now.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.474
Count me in.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.643
I'd like to take it alone.
Thank you.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.046
Okay. Just don't use
all the hot water.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.185
- Do you mind?
- Never saw a thing.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.088
And stay away from the window.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.624
We've got a very nosy
neighbor, Mrs. Ochmonek.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.794
"Ochmonek."
Sounds like a typo.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.664
Just don't let her see you.
She might turn you in.

a thing as a cross

and an aardvark?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.813
(Trevor)
'Ah, stop putting
yourself down.'

11:21.815 --> 11:23.314
I'm not talking about me.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.316
I'm talking about
that thing staring at me

11:25.318 --> 11:27.118
'from that bathroom window.'

11:27.120 --> 11:28.687
(Trevor)
'What?'

11:30.991 --> 11:34.125
- I don't see nothing.
- It was there a second ago.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.994
And I think it was shaving.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.530
Yeah, right,
and I'm Sean Penn.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.102
[screams]

11:46.406 --> 11:48.306
- Towel.
- You talking to me?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.375
Yeah, would you hand me
something to dry off with

11:50.377 --> 11:51.509
please?

11:51.511 --> 11:52.811
You got it.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.587
Will this do the trick?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.127
No problem.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.351

¶ Proud Mary keep on burnin' ¶¶

12:34.755 --> 12:36.354
- ALF!
- Yaow!

12:36.356 --> 12:38.690
Yeah, how you doing
up there, William?

12:38.692 --> 12:41.292
Frankly, I could use
a little help.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.294
I don't know much
about this thing.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.765
Me either. I just turn the key
and it goes.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.135
I'll get the wrench, dad.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.238
Hey, Lynn, you don't happen to
have a phone in here, do you?

12:53.240 --> 12:57.075
- No, why?
- K-L-V-Z, Bonus tune.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.544
Fifteenth caller

12:59.546 --> 13:02.580
Oh, wait, forget it.
Must be a licensed driver.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.415
- Wrench, please.
- I'm a licensed driver.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.950
Quick, what's the name
of the tune?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.385
Wrench, please.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.321
"Born In The USA."

13:10.323 --> 13:11.956
No wonder I didn't know it.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.258
I'll call.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.793
- 'Wrench!'
- What's the phone number?

13:14.795 --> 13:18.730
Area code, 3-1-1 5-5-5 9-8..

13:18.732 --> 13:22.901

13:22.903 --> 13:24.469
...4-5.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.439
- Sorry, dad.
- Thank you.

13:28.441 --> 13:32.110
ALF.. I think
you'd better try to make

13:32.112 --> 13:34.612
contact with your...people.

13:34.614 --> 13:38.449
I have tried.
I've tried again and again.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.319
It's-it's an exercise
in futility.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.289
Uh. Uh, let's face it.
I'm trapped here!

13:44.291 --> 13:47.959
I'll never see the-the
purple side of my planet again!

13:47.961 --> 13:50.929
[ALF sobbing]

13:56.303 --> 13:57.635
Too dramatic?

13:57.637 --> 14:00.205
[chuckling]
Oh, ALF.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.608
What are we gonna
do with you?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.310
I guess, you'll just
have to love me

14:05.312 --> 14:07.378
for as long as it lasts.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.215
We will.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.998
Look, if you're not gonna help--

14:27.000 --> 14:29.567
I'm out of here. Look, if you
need me, I'll be in the house.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.470
- We won't need you.
- I'll still be in the house.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.342
Yo! Lucky, my man.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.352
Do you get "Sesame Street,"
where you live?

14:47.354 --> 14:50.021
No. And, frankly,
I don't get it here either.

(women on TV)
'If you said, "It was the cow,
riding on the subway."'

14:53.426 --> 14:55.493
'You're absolutely right.'

14:55.495 --> 14:59.330
Brilliant. This and the letter
"I," in one day.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.165
I got to get
something to drink.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.734
Me too.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.273
Where are you two going?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.041
We got to get
something to drink.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.776
We're parched.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.411
Okay, but..

15:13.413 --> 15:16.214
...no soda pop, and nothing
to eat before dinner.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.483
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.419
Jeez, what's with the warden?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.658
[pops]

15:30.096 --> 15:32.363
I said no soda pop.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.232
It's not soda pop. It's beer.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.467
[burps]
You're about out of Coors.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.404
What?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.372
[sighs]
Give those to me!

15:41.374 --> 15:43.608
Hey, careful.
His is still full.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.809
[sighs]

15:47.547 --> 15:49.147
Now you just listen to me, ALF.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.950
I will not allow this
kind of behavior in my house.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.820
This boy is only six years old,
he is<i> not</i> to drink beer

15:55.822 --> 15:57.755
and<i> you</i> are not
to drink beer.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.590
And I don't know
what it's like on Mork

15:59.592 --> 16:01.592
or whatever planet
you come from but--

16:01.594 --> 16:03.127
Melmac.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.430
- What?
- Melmac.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.565
That was the name
of my planet.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.667
It's also
what it was made out of.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.937
What do you mean, "was?"

16:12.939 --> 16:17.108
Well, you see that's
the thing, Kate, uh...ma'am.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.576
Melmac's history.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.811
[chuckling]
Wait a minute.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.447
Um, are you trying
to tell me that..

16:22.449 --> 16:24.649
...you can't go
back to Melmac?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.417
It exploded.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.422
This was my street.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.426
Now, now, if Willie
fixes my ship

16:35.428 --> 16:37.795
I suppose I could
start a new life

16:37.797 --> 16:43.134
somewhere else, on some desolate
crater-filled asteroid.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.771
Spend the rest of my life
fending off gamma rays.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.773
No, ALF. No.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.609
We want you to stay here
with us, don't we, mom?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.644
Brian, please try
to understand.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.080
Hey, the kid wants me
to stay.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.518
- ALF, do you mind?
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.889
Honey, we can't
hide ALF forever

17:04.891 --> 17:07.125
and I can't go on
like this.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.493
Watching him every moment

17:08.495 --> 17:10.895
wondering what he's going
to do next.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.874
But he'll be good. He won't
break the rules anymore.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.810
Will you, ALF?

17:25.812 --> 17:27.445
Cross my heart!

17:28.848 --> 17:30.181
[Lucky meows]

17:30.183 --> 17:32.383
How you doing, Lucky?

17:32.385 --> 17:35.153
See? No problem.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.621
[ALF growls]

17:37.557 --> 17:38.689
[knock on door]

17:38.691 --> 17:40.892
Oh, no! Who could that be?

17:40.894 --> 17:44.095
- I don't know.
- Don't answer it, mom, please.

17:44.097 --> 17:47.198
(Kate)
'Brian, I, I am going
to answer the door.'

17:47.200 --> 17:48.599
- No!
- Yes!

17:48.601 --> 17:50.868
It's probably just Mrs. Ochmonek
but even if it's not--

17:50.870 --> 17:53.171
- It's not!
- What?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.872
It's not Mrs. Ochmonek

17:54.874 --> 17:57.175
unless she's just
joined the army.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.382
It is a military man.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.717
What if he wants
to take ALF away?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.219
I don't know, Brian.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.455
But if that's why he's here for
and if I decide

18:10.457 --> 18:11.722
that's the right thing to do

18:11.724 --> 18:14.425
you'll just have
to understand, okay?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.893
Yes, mom.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.061
[knock on door]

18:17.063 --> 18:18.563
We gave at the office.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.932
Shh!
ALF.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.069
[sighs]
Did you fix the spaceship?

18:25.071 --> 18:26.637
I'm sorry. I couldn't do it.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.973
I just, I don't
have the right parts.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.041
[knocking continues]

18:31.211 --> 18:32.710
Ball's in your court.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.847
[knocking continues]

18:38.751 --> 18:40.718
- Mrs. Tanner?
- Yes.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.088
I'm Darnell Valentine
with the Alien Task Force

18:44.090 --> 18:45.490
stationed at Edwards.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.259
- 'Mind if I come in?
- Yes, I do.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.727
Fine with me.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.929
Mrs. Tanner, we've received
an anonymous tip

18:51.931 --> 18:54.765
that you might be harboring
a space creature.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.635
- Uh, a space creature?
- Yes.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.138
Hairy. About three feet tall.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.809
Is, uh...is he considered
dangerous?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.577
Hard to tell
until we get in the lab.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.680
Uh-huh and, um,
what would you do with him

19:09.682 --> 19:11.582
if you did get him,
you know, in the lab?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.784
Oh, the usual battery of tests.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.454
We'll see how he responds
to intense heat

19:16.456 --> 19:19.624
freezing cold, high voltage

19:19.626 --> 19:24.295
toxic substances, pain,
sleep deprivation

19:24.297 --> 19:27.598
inoculation, that's needles

19:27.600 --> 19:29.967
and of course,
dissection.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.002
[gulps]

19:31.004 --> 19:34.472
Why don't you just
pull it's toenails out?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.007
You didn't let me finish.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.946
Don't bother.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.849
We are not harboring
any space creatures.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.218
Fine. Thank you.
Have a nice day.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.221
Uh, excuse me, sir,
could you, just tell us..

19:50.223 --> 19:51.856
who gave you our name?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.791
As I told Mrs. Tanner,
that information is

19:53.793 --> 19:55.893
strictly Ochmonek,
uh, anonymous.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.596
Goodbye.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.503
- Thanks, mom.
- Thanks, mom.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.139
Yeah, thanks..

20:08.141 --> 20:09.307

20:34.234 --> 20:36.801
Let see if I can get
this thing going.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.770
Pull these here.

Melmac touch.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.677
Hello!

Anybody there? Yo!

Calling anybody from
Melmac.<i> Hello?</i>

20:52.185 --> 20:54.352
Skip? Larry?

20:54.354 --> 20:57.054
Muffy? It's Gordon.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.690
Look, I don't know,
if you can hear me

20:59.692 --> 21:03.227
but I just wanted to
let you know, I'm okay.

21:03.229 --> 21:06.230
I-I'm living with what
they call a family.

21:06.232 --> 21:10.735
Yeah. They're-they're sort of
like a herd, only smaller.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.903
Yeah, there's this
guy named, Willie

21:12.905 --> 21:15.740
and he's got a good heart
and lots of smarts

21:15.742 --> 21:17.908
for someone without fur.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.810
'Then there's his wife, Kate.'

21:19.812 --> 21:22.480
'Well, she pretends
she doesn't like me, but, uh..'

21:22.482 --> 21:23.748
...she'll come around.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.883
Yeah, oh, oh,
and hey, dig this

21:25.885 --> 21:28.085
her hair is the
same color as mine.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.421
Yeah, only hers is natural.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.157
Haa! Haa! Ha! Yeah!

21:33.159 --> 21:35.893
Yeah and they've got
these two terrific kids

21:35.895 --> 21:38.429
who-who both idolize me.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.765
So, so you know they're okay.

21:40.767 --> 21:44.568
But, uh, I wanted to
tell you something.

21:44.570 --> 21:48.072
I, uh, I really miss all of you.

21:48.074 --> 21:52.109
And the thought of
never seeing you again..

21:52.111 --> 21:54.912
[sniffles]
...sort of breaks my heart.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.748
'So, uh..'

21:57.750 --> 22:00.117
...you know, if you could..

22:00.119 --> 22:02.753
...try to get in touch with me..

22:02.755 --> 22:07.158
...uh, or better yet, come by.

22:07.160 --> 22:11.829
And, uh, I'll introduce you
to these lovely people.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.767
And then we could eat their cat.

22:21.307 --> 22:25.009
So, the droid says to the
cranble, "To tell you the truth

22:25.011 --> 22:26.677
"I'd feel even better
if she lived

22:26.679 --> 22:28.779
another six light years away."

22:28.781 --> 22:30.715
[all laughing]

22:32.652 --> 22:34.452
(ALF)
Yeah. Yeah.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.956
I...I think that
really was amusing

22:38.958 --> 22:41.058
six, six light years away.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.329
I guess you had to be there.
I<i> was!</i>

22:45.331 --> 22:47.865
[all laughing]

22:50.737 --> 22:52.536
More mash potatoes, please.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.505
Hey, lob 'em over here
when you're done with them.

22:54.507 --> 22:57.074
I'm getting kinda
used to this mushy stuff.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.845
I like mash potatoes
too now, mom.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.114
He likes mash potatoes now too.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.416
You know, I hate
to be a black cloud

23:05.418 --> 23:07.351
but what are we gonna do
with ALF when Lynn has her

23:07.353 --> 23:08.486
pajama party next week?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.855
- Oh, that's right.
- Hey, no problem.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.690
I wear a size five

23:12.692 --> 23:14.392
but nothing with feet in it.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.993
[all laughing]

23:17.063 --> 23:18.863
Oh, I've got a zillion of 'em.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.498
Here's another one
you won't like.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.068
