WEBVTT

00:08.933 --> 00:10.800
- Snack attack!

00:10.900 --> 00:12.133
Broccoli?

00:12.233 --> 00:15.367
Don't waste my time.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.567
- MONITOR: Alert, alert.

00:17.667 --> 00:20.533
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.500
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
Phoebe, we have a problem.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.367
- I know.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.233
Dad taught Chloe snack attack.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.533
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
Not that.

00:27.633 --> 00:30.133
It seems you've missed
your power assessment test

00:30.233 --> 00:31.367
when you were in fifth grade

00:31.467 --> 00:33.833
at the secret academy
of super power studies?

00:33.933 --> 00:36.000
You know, SASS.

00:37.067 --> 00:38.200
That's impossible.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.567
I've never missed
a day of school in my life.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.800
Phoebe, remember that surprise
three-day weekend

00:44.900 --> 00:46.200
we had in fifth grade?

00:46.300 --> 00:47.900
- Sure. When they closed
the school on Friday

00:48.000 --> 00:49.300
for locker waxing...

00:49.400 --> 00:52.700
And now that I'm hearing it,
I realize is not a thing.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.933
- I hacked into SASS mail
and sent you a message

00:55.033 --> 00:56.400
saying there was no school,

00:56.500 --> 00:59.033
ruining your stupid
perfect attendance.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.067
- With a computer and a dream.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.233
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT: Phoebe,
I'm afraid I have to suspend you

01:05.333 --> 01:07.933
from hero duties
until you go back to fifth grade

01:08.067 --> 01:09.400
and pass that test.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.433
- I can't go back
to fifth grade.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.333
That's when I had a retainer
and my  lisp.

01:14.433 --> 01:17.700
Gosh. Just thinking about it
brings it back.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.800
Wish I could be
there to see that.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.067
- You will be.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.733
Say what?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.767
- You missed the test, too.

01:25.867 --> 01:29.333
Pass this one or I'll throw you
in Hero League Junior Jail

01:29.433 --> 01:31.867
for hacking
into school computers.

01:31.967 --> 01:36.600
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's time for my super snack.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.100
- Snack attack!

01:38.200 --> 01:40.233
Now that's a snack, baby.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.467
- * What you see
is not what you get *

01:48.567 --> 01:51.733
* Living our lives
with a secret *

01:51.833 --> 01:54.867
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

01:54.967 --> 01:58.400
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

01:58.500 --> 02:02.200
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:02.300 --> 02:05.167
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

02:05.267 --> 02:06.867
* This isn't make-believe

02:06.967 --> 02:08.367
* It's our reality

02:08.467 --> 02:11.333
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:11.433 --> 02:13.200
* And stay out of trouble

02:13.300 --> 02:16.500
* Living a double life *

02:20.667 --> 02:23.533
- Ah! There's my two
little fifth graders.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.533
- You guys have to repeat
the fifth grade?

02:25.633 --> 02:27.067
- Join the club.

02:27.167 --> 02:29.967
Seriously, we meet on Thursdays.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.700
- We are not repeating
the fifth grade.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.667
We're just going back
to Metroburg for a day

02:33.767 --> 02:34.767
to take a test.

02:34.867 --> 02:37.833
- I packed my little kiddies
some lunch.

02:37.933 --> 02:40.467
Now does anyone
have to tinkle before you go?

02:40.567 --> 02:43.967
- Mom, we're not little kids.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.200
Aww, I got chocolate chip.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.933
Tradesies?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.067
- No tradesies backsies.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.400
- Okay, Thundermans, line up.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.233
As this family's president
of important stuff,

02:54.333 --> 02:56.400
it's time for me to assign
our weekly chores.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.200
Billy, you are on dishwashing.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.733
- Yes!

03:04.467 --> 03:07.800
- Did you say dishwashing
or fishwashing?

03:07.900 --> 03:10.433
I'll just do both.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.133
- Right, Nora, you're up next.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.533
Your chore
is weeding the garden.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.233
But that's
the fourth time in a row.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.500
- Well doing math
and your chores

03:18.600 --> 03:19.900
at the exact same time?

03:20.067 --> 03:23.833
You just earned a presidential
seal of approval.

03:23.933 --> 03:25.733
- *

03:42.333 --> 03:45.467
- Whoa! It feels so weird
to be back at SASS.

03:45.567 --> 03:49.233
- Yep. This is where
the Max legend was born.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.900
I thought
it was born in your mind?

03:53.933 --> 03:55.633
I owned this place.

03:55.733 --> 03:56.867
Watch.

03:56.967 --> 04:00.367
Excuse me, have you ever heard
of Max Thunderman?

04:00.467 --> 04:03.333
- No. But I've heard
of Phoebe Thunderman.

04:03.433 --> 04:05.300
OMG! You're her!

04:05.400 --> 04:06.700
- That's enough.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.500
- Scram!

04:10.600 --> 04:11.467
I don't care what she says.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.767
My pranks were legendary.

04:13.867 --> 04:18.300
In fact, I once magnetized
this very wall

04:18.400 --> 04:21.067
and stuck this kid
named Metalbutt to it.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.067
- That was mean.

04:22.167 --> 04:24.100
- You're right. I am great.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.767
- HALL MONITOR: Warning!

04:25.867 --> 04:28.567
You are in violation
of school uniform.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.367
- Oh, hall monitor, we don't
actually go here. We're just--

04:31.467 --> 04:33.400
- Prepare
for clothing enhancement.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.367
- And the legend continues.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.067
- Hey! You get back here!

04:44.167 --> 04:45.700
I'm a boy! I'm Max Thunderman.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.833
- HALL MONITOR:
Never heard of you.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.200
- Dad, this is so unfair.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.833
We're supposed to rotate chores.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.067
When was the last time
you weeded the garden?

04:56.167 --> 04:57.333
- Now, Nora.

04:57.433 --> 05:01.333
You know your father
gets...gardener's calf.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.400
- Sorry, sweetie.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.100
As president of important stuff,

05:04.200 --> 05:05.967
I've already assigned
the chores.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.400
My hands are tied.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.933
Yours should be weeding.

05:10.067 --> 05:13.400
- You know, I don't remember
anyone electing you president.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.633
- Honey, that's not
how we do it in this house.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.733
- Well that's how
the country does it.

05:17.833 --> 05:20.633
Are you saying the country
is wrong?

05:20.733 --> 05:21.667
- No.

05:21.767 --> 05:24.600
- Then I'd like to run
for president.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.467
- Hank, can I talk to you
for a sec?

05:30.533 --> 05:33.300
Oh, you need to shut this down.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.367
If there's an election
and Nora wins,

05:35.467 --> 05:37.333
she's going to be in charge
of assigning chores.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.600
- Barb, relax.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.300
There's no way
I'm going to allow an election.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.300
Afraid I'll beat you.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.500
- Oh!
You got yourself an election.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.067
- And remember,
when fighting a villain,

05:54.167 --> 05:58.533
it's make him cower,
zap his power and take a shower.

05:58.633 --> 05:59.567
That's right, kid.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.600
Hip to hygiene, yo.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.567
Oh, visitors.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.200
You must be Max and Phoebe.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.567
These kids also missed the test
and will be taking it with you.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.133
Names and powers.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.833
- Chester, porcupine powers.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.700
- Rodney, force fields.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.600
- Jocelyn, glow in the dark.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.733
- Keely, control of the weather.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.967
- My lunch!

06:38.067 --> 06:39.500
- Still working on my aim.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.467
- Well, I'm Max Thunderman.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.933
Guessing you already know
what my powers are, right?

06:51.167 --> 06:54.300
- Go make a rainbow.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.333
- So, erm,
a couple of questions.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.367
Do you grade on a curve?
Is there a time limit?

06:58.467 --> 07:00.600
What about extra credit?

07:00.700 --> 07:02.367
- I'll give you an extra point
right now

07:02.467 --> 07:05.833
if you take your seat
and stop talking.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.800
- You're down a point already,
Max.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.233
- Hi. So you're not going to ask
Chester to the super dance,

07:19.333 --> 07:22.200
are you?

07:22.300 --> 07:27.733
- Gee. He seems very nice,
but he's a little too...ten.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.667
- Good. 'Cause I, kind of,
have a crush on him,

07:29.767 --> 07:31.200
but he likes Jocelyn.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.433
And she doesn't even like him.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.133
Can you believe that?

07:34.233 --> 07:36.667
- Well, no way.

07:36.767 --> 07:39.233
- Let's get our test on.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.067
Leonard.

07:42.133 --> 07:45.367
- Phoebe, does that assistant
look familiar to you?

07:45.467 --> 07:48.600
- Quiet.
I'm arranging my test pencils.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.333
- Today's test
will be in three parts.

07:50.433 --> 07:55.067
Each team will have to pass
two of them to pass fifth grade.

07:55.133 --> 07:56.900
Release the robot.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.867
For this first test,

08:02.967 --> 08:05.200
each team will need to combine
the items on the table,

08:05.300 --> 08:10.800
into a weapon to disable
the robot before it zaps you.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.233
Jocelyn and Keely, you're up.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.800
And go.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.800
- If I knew fifth grade
was this easy,

08:20.900 --> 08:22.800
I would have gone to class more.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.567
We'll be out of here in no time.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.167
- Don't be so sure, Max.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.133
Remember me?

08:31.367 --> 08:34.067
- Metalbutt!

08:34.100 --> 08:35.467
Is that the same Metalbutt--

08:35.567 --> 08:38.467
- Who your brother
stuck to a wall?

08:38.567 --> 08:40.800
The same.
- Oh.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.767
- Dude, you're still angry
about that?

08:42.867 --> 08:45.300
It's dude now?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.067
Not tin tush, or rust rump?

08:48.167 --> 08:51.633
Because that's what
you used to call me.

08:51.733 --> 08:53.900
- Tin tush.
That's pretty good.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.700
- Not as good as the revenge
I'm gonna get on both of you.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.167
What did I do?

08:58.267 --> 09:01.167
- It's because of what you wrote
in my fifth grade yearbook.

09:01.267 --> 09:03.567
Which was nothing!

09:03.667 --> 09:05.267
- Twenty seconds girls.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.333
- ROBOT: Acquiring target.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.867
Right. I happen to know that
if you don't pass today's test,

09:24.967 --> 09:26.600
Phoebe won't be
a superhero anymore

09:26.700 --> 09:29.133
and Max goes to junior jail.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.700
And I'm going to make sure
that happens.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.533
What can you do?

09:33.633 --> 09:34.867
That guy's in charge.

09:40.067 --> 09:44.267
- Argh! Aah!

09:44.367 --> 09:46.167
Leonard, you're in charge!

09:57.533 --> 09:59.233
- *

10:02.967 --> 10:04.833
- All right, I'm just gonna call
Super President Kickbutt

10:04.933 --> 10:06.933
and tell her that
this creepy assistant hates us

10:07.033 --> 10:08.633
and plans to fail us
to get his revenge.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.667
- No cellphones during the exam!

10:11.767 --> 10:15.033
I'll just put this right here.

10:15.133 --> 10:16.133
And sit on it.

10:19.733 --> 10:21.133
- You're up, Thunder-germs.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.700
You have exactly one minute
to defeat the robot

10:23.800 --> 10:28.500
using only the items
in front of you.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.133
- A mop, a roller skate,
a clock radio, and some hay?

10:32.233 --> 10:35.367
- The other kids got fuses and
power crystals and blast powder.

10:35.467 --> 10:41.200
- Oh, well in that case...go!

10:41.300 --> 10:43.667
- Uh...ah, okay,

10:43.767 --> 10:46.667
what if I walk over to the robot
and hit it with the mop?

10:50.433 --> 10:53.767
- Give me that,
I've got a better idea.

10:53.867 --> 10:58.067
- ROBOT: 30 seconds
to laser annihilation.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.833
Acquiring target.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.833
- Max, hurry up,
it's gonna zap up.

11:02.933 --> 11:04.600
- Done!

11:06.267 --> 11:11.433
Hey, now you have a date
to the super dance.

11:11.533 --> 11:16.433
Pathetic.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.433
- X280 robots can't withstand
high frequency,

11:28.533 --> 11:30.667
so I rewired the clock's alarm.

11:45.900 --> 11:46.900
- No!

11:51.633 --> 11:54.300
- Very well.
You passed test number one.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.867
Now, onto number two.

11:55.967 --> 11:58.733
- Speaking of number two,
I've always wondered

11:58.833 --> 12:00.767
with your metal butt,
how do you--

12:00.867 --> 12:05.300
- I could tell you,
but you'll never un-hear it.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.300
- Please--
- We're good.

12:12.233 --> 12:16.633
- Welcome to the thriller
in Hiddenvilla!

12:19.633 --> 12:22.367
- This is where
Nora and Daddy Doofus

12:22.467 --> 12:23.867
try to convince you
to vote for them

12:23.967 --> 12:25.967
to be president
of important stuff.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.900
- Why do you get to ask
the questions?

12:30.367 --> 12:31.300
- Check it out.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.500
I'm that lady on the dollar.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.067
- Carry on.

12:37.133 --> 12:40.900
- Hank, you're old,
so you get the first question.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.967
Why would anyone
in their right mind

12:43.067 --> 12:44.900
vote for you to be president?

12:45.067 --> 12:47.167
- That is an excellent question.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.700
Let me respond by saying,
who wants chocolate?

12:53.733 --> 12:57.567
- What's more American
than Swiss chocolate?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.533
- Yay, America!

12:59.633 --> 13:03.233
- *

13:05.133 --> 13:06.333
- Moving on.

13:06.433 --> 13:07.500
Nora!

13:07.600 --> 13:09.900
Why should you be president?

13:10.067 --> 13:13.133
- Well, if you vote for me
I will listen to you

13:13.233 --> 13:15.367
and give out chores
in a fair manner,

13:15.467 --> 13:18.600
because, one day, dad's
chocolate fountain will run out

13:18.700 --> 13:19.700
and when it does--

13:19.800 --> 13:21.333
- I'll bring in the carnival!

13:21.433 --> 13:22.767
Come on in, guys!

13:38.800 --> 13:41.300
- Alright, guys, it's time
for test number two.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.067
Chester and Rodney, you're up.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.733
- This one's for you, Jocelyn.

13:48.833 --> 13:52.533
- Don't care.
Don't like you.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.567
Chester's completely crushed out
on Jocelyn.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.667
Barely knows I exist.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.067
- Hey, look, Keely.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.633
Do you want some advice
from someone

13:59.733 --> 14:02.867
who's had crushes on boys
that did not notice her?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.500
- I'd prefer to get advice
from a teenager

14:04.600 --> 14:07.500
who isn't repeating fifth grade.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.667
But go ahead.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.433
- Stop worrying so much
about being noticed.

14:12.533 --> 14:17.133
You're smart, you're sweet,
and you can control the weather.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.400
If Chester has half a brain,
he'll notice you.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.967
- Yes.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.900
And if he doesn't,
you can make it hail ice balls

14:25.067 --> 14:26.633
on his big, dumb head.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.067
- Thanks.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.300
- Done!
- Done!

14:35.333 --> 14:39.633
- Okay, that means
it's Max and Phoebe's turn.

14:39.733 --> 14:40.967
Come on up, guys.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.433
And since you're so great
and super,

14:49.533 --> 14:52.667
why don't we switch things up
a bit to keep it interesting.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.067
- Switch it up all you want.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.133
Nothing can keep us
from winning.

14:56.233 --> 14:59.533
- Three, two, one.

14:59.633 --> 15:03.767
- Ha, ha, you lost.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.900
- Maybe that's because...we're
in straitjackets!

15:08.767 --> 15:10.200
- Yeah.
This is totally unfair.

15:10.300 --> 15:14.133
- So is needing a screwdriver
to go to the bathroom!

15:14.233 --> 15:16.867
You're just making excuses,
because everyone else passed.

15:16.967 --> 15:18.267
- We haven't even gone yet.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.500
- I said you passed!

15:22.633 --> 15:23.733
- The voting started, Hank.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.933
Please tell me
you have this under control.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.300
- The kids love me.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.567
I'm, for sure, going to get
Billy and Chloe's votes.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.933
- It's okay. With our two votes,
all I really need is Billy's.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.933
I gave them chocolate,
jugglers, a tap dancing clown.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.967
- You can go home now, Tapsy.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.067
- I guess Nora was right.

15:58.167 --> 16:01.800
The kids want a president
who will listen and be fair.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.200
- Well, that hasn't been me
at all.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.067
All I've really done is
mess things up with my daughter.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.233
Nora, can I talk to you?

16:12.333 --> 16:16.533
- Sure,
President Fudge Fountain.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.400
- I owe you an apology.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.533
You were right.

16:19.633 --> 16:22.067
I did not listen to you,
and a good president

16:22.167 --> 16:27.800
listens to the people
he or she leads.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.933
I'd be proud
to call you my president.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.900
Okay, Barb,
time to read the votes.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.567
- Oh wait! Don't forget mine.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.700
- Listen, when you win this,

16:42.800 --> 16:44.100
I'll let you eat cake
for breakfast

16:44.200 --> 16:47.333
if you don't make me
clean the toilets.

16:47.433 --> 16:50.400
Alright, here we go!

16:50.500 --> 16:51.767
One vote for Hank.

16:51.867 --> 16:53.900
- Thank you, sweetie.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.833
- Two votes for Hank.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.333
- Thank you, self.

16:58.433 --> 17:02.533
- One vote for Nora.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.300
Two votes for Nora.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.400
This vote must be Nora's,

17:09.500 --> 17:10.833
I guess
we don't have to read it.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.467
- Oh you read it nice and loud.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.733
- Three votes for Hank.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.300
You're father wins!

17:22.067 --> 17:24.933
He was my second choice!

17:25.067 --> 17:28.733
- Sweetie, after all that
you voted for me?

17:28.833 --> 17:30.167
How come?

17:30.267 --> 17:32.267
- You admitted that you should
have listened to us more,

17:32.367 --> 17:35.900
and that's all I really wanted.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.733
- Help!

17:37.833 --> 17:39.900
This might have been a mistake.

17:49.133 --> 17:50.367
- All right, Max, this is it.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.200
If we don't pass this test,
I'm no longer a superhero

17:52.300 --> 17:55.767
and you go to jail a lot sooner
than everyone expected.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.167
- Okay. For our last test,

17:58.267 --> 18:00.667
you have to cross the room,
save the dummy,

18:00.767 --> 18:05.067
and get back all while dodging
burning hot lasers.

18:09.733 --> 18:12.767
Ooh, they look lethal.

18:12.867 --> 18:15.567
Let's start with Max and Phoebe.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.567
- Mr. Silver Eagle
says students should always

18:17.667 --> 18:19.933
wear protective gear
when they use lasers.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.267
- Well, Mr. Silver Eagle
isn't here,

18:22.367 --> 18:24.733
so shut your hero hole!

18:24.833 --> 18:27.633
You two! Go!

18:40.067 --> 18:41.433
- He cranked it up to extreme!

18:41.533 --> 18:44.300
- Then we need to crank it up
to extreme.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.867
- Yep.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.133
- *

18:58.600 --> 18:59.700
- We have to help them!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.200
- I know!

19:01.300 --> 19:03.233
Maybe I can take out the lasers
with the blaster

19:03.333 --> 19:04.833
we used on the robot.

19:15.933 --> 19:18.500
Ah!

19:18.600 --> 19:21.533
- The blast
must have magnetized the logo.

19:21.633 --> 19:23.367
- Hilarious.

19:23.467 --> 19:24.733
Let's grab the dummy and run.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.600
- No, Max.
We have to save Leonard.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.733
That Leonard?

19:30.833 --> 19:32.467
The Leonard that wants you
to lose your cape?

19:32.567 --> 19:34.167
The Leonard who wants
to send me to junior jail?

19:34.267 --> 19:36.667
The Leonard who--
- Yes, stop describing him.

19:36.767 --> 19:37.833
- But we'll fail.

19:40.700 --> 19:41.633
Fine.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.567
- Get away from me.
Don't touch me.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.900
We're mortal enemies.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.100
- We're not mortal enemies,
calm down.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.400
Let us save you.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.167
- Trickery!

19:55.267 --> 19:56.400
- We're not tricking you.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.733
Max, I'll buy us some time.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.167
- Look, I'm sorry I called you
names at school

20:04.267 --> 20:05.867
and, also today...

20:05.967 --> 20:07.433
and just a second ago
under my breath.

20:07.533 --> 20:09.400
But it's just because
I was a jerk

20:09.500 --> 20:11.100
and trying to make a name
for myself.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.533
So will you let us save you?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.400
Phoebe, the magnetism's
too strong.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.433
- We need to neutralize
the magnetic field.

20:21.533 --> 20:22.833
Keely!

20:22.933 --> 20:25.500
Use your weather powers to form
a rain cloud over Leonard.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.667
- On it.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.367
- Good. Now hit the logo
with a lightning bolt.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.600
- My aim isn't good enough.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.800
I might hit one of you.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.033
- No you won't.
I believe in you.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.233
Now do it!

20:54.000 --> 20:57.200
- Sorry, looks like you failed.

21:00.267 --> 21:03.067
J-K! That was amaze balls!

21:03.133 --> 21:04.333
Best save ever!

21:04.433 --> 21:06.533
Real sixth grade stuff.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.367
Yeah.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.567
Leonard,
I know you're behind this.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.600
I'm bumping you down
to the third graders.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.967
No!

21:15.067 --> 21:16.167
They're monsters!

21:16.267 --> 21:17.767
- Let's go, brass booty!

21:20.767 --> 21:23.733
- Keely, you were awesome.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.467
Maybe we can go
to the super dance together?

21:26.567 --> 21:29.633
- Erm, maybe, I'll let you know.

21:29.733 --> 21:33.400
Excuse me a sec.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.533
Chester says he wants to go
to the super dance with me.

21:36.633 --> 21:38.067
- Congratulations.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.867
- Thanks for believing in me.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.067
- Maybe I'll see you round.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.700
- Hey, Max!

21:43.800 --> 21:45.833
That was so cool!

21:45.933 --> 21:47.067
Will you sign my notebook?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.067
- Uh, sure.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.200
Look at that, Phoebe.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.433
Looks like I will be remembered
after all.

21:52.533 --> 21:53.500
- You bet!

21:53.600 --> 21:55.733
The big-hearted hero
who saved Leonard,

21:55.833 --> 21:58.500
and loves his sister.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.267
No, that's--that's not how
I want to be remembered.

22:02.367 --> 22:03.333
Get back here, kid.

22:03.433 --> 22:04.667
Stop remembering me!

22:11.233 --> 22:16.533
- *
