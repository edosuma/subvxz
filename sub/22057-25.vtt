My name is Commander
Steve McGarrett.

12:51.335 --> 12:53.468
I run a law enforcement
task force on this island.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.731
You're not military?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.690
I was. I figured they'd
be involved soon enough,

12:58.734 --> 13:00.910
but I thought maybe
before that happens,

13:00.954 --> 13:02.912
we could talk without
rattling sabers,

13:02.956 --> 13:05.697
you tell me what
all this is about.

13:05.741 --> 13:09.701
I am Officer Vasili Shirokov,

13:09.745 --> 13:11.399
acting commander of this vessel.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.835
Good to meet you.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.184
Where's the captain?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.805
Where's the man
who shot him?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.510
Hey, it's Steve.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.818
Hey. I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone.

13:38.861 --> 13:39.949
You all right?

13:39.993 --> 13:41.429
Yeah, I am.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.822
I'm good. I'm good.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.475
TANI: For real?For real.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.390
Sir, what's going on?All right,

13:46.434 --> 13:49.132
here's the situation-- four days
ago, there was a mutiny at sea.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.569
Okay, 33 of the 61 crew members

13:51.613 --> 13:54.529
participated with the intent
on defecting to the U.S.

13:54.572 --> 13:55.965
It all started

13:56.009 --> 13:58.489
when a senior officer
by the name of Yuri Petrov

13:58.533 --> 13:59.882
murdered the captain.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.624
Now, the mutiny
was put down hours ago,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.669
but nobody could find Petrov.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.934
It's believed that once the sub
reached our shoreline,

14:07.977 --> 14:10.414
Petrov escaped
through the torpedo bay.

14:12.721 --> 14:13.983
Okay.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.159
A] What?!

14:16.203 --> 14:17.682
And B]

14:17.726 --> 14:19.902
If somebody's trying to defect,

14:19.946 --> 14:22.165
this guy sure did go through
a whole lot of trouble.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.515
Right. Which makes me think
this is about something else.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.169
But even if it's not,
we now have a killer

14:26.213 --> 14:27.388
loose on the island.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.962
MAN:
My government is

14:36.005 --> 14:38.312
terribly sorry for these,
uh, unfortunate circumstances

14:38.355 --> 14:40.444
in which we currently
find ourselves.

14:40.488 --> 14:43.665
Well, we appreciate that.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.407
Can you tell us what
Petrov's agenda might be?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.843
I'm afraid we don't know.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.150
Is that the Kremlin's
official position?

14:50.193 --> 14:51.934
It is.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.893
Okay.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.330
Do you know if he has
any contacts on the island,

14:56.373 --> 14:58.462
anybody he might go to?

14:58.506 --> 15:01.901
This, gentleman,
is what we have on Petrov.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.998
Are you kidding with this?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.564
DANNY: Yeah,
we're gonna need

15:13.608 --> 15:15.001
a little more intel than this.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.525
My apologies,
but, uh, this is all

15:17.568 --> 15:19.005
that I am authorized
to give you.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.094
Look...

15:21.137 --> 15:23.009
Petrov committed mutiny,

15:23.052 --> 15:25.663
he murdered his skipper,
now he's at large, all right?

15:25.707 --> 15:28.014
We have to work together if
we're gonna catch this guy.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.146
I will do everything
in my power to help you,

15:30.190 --> 15:33.323
but you must understand
that to some degree,

15:33.367 --> 15:35.456
my hands,
they are tied by Moscow.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.026
Mr. Malkin, you should know
that we did our homework on you

15:40.069 --> 15:41.375
on the way over.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.204
Okay, we know you like
it here in Hawaii.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.728
According to our source,
you're dating a local woman,

15:46.771 --> 15:47.729
is that right?

15:47.772 --> 15:48.948
Who is not your wife.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.558
Or am I mistaken?

15:52.168 --> 15:55.389
And I suppose you will tell her
if I don't do what you say?

15:55.432 --> 15:56.999
No, no, no, I wouldn't do that.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.567
I'm just trying to point out
the fact that you're a scumbag.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.743
What I will do is stop by
the State Department

16:01.786 --> 16:04.572
and have your
diplomatic credentials revoked,

16:04.615 --> 16:07.967
have your ass sent
home-- that I'll do.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.969
Or you can help us out, right?

16:11.883 --> 16:14.060
What kind of policemen are you?

16:14.103 --> 16:16.497
The kind that don't like
to be stonewalled.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.764
Petrov...

16:22.807 --> 16:25.114
has no contacts
that we are aware of.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.116
All right.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.944
Uh, again,
do you have any idea

16:28.988 --> 16:30.946
what he's doing here?

16:32.556 --> 16:35.298
Well, this could be
something, but, uh,

16:35.342 --> 16:38.432
I heard that Officer Petrov
suffered horrific tragedy

16:38.475 --> 16:40.086
when he was young boy,

16:40.129 --> 16:42.218
but I could not tell you
the nature of it.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.699
So what are you thinking?

16:44.742 --> 16:46.962
Perhaps he just snapped.You think Petrov

16:47.006 --> 16:48.529
had some kind of
mental breakdown?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.096
It is possible.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.796
Okay. Come on, Danny.
This is a waste of time.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.104
Commander McGarrett.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.931
What?

16:59.975 --> 17:02.673
My government did wish for me
to relay message to you.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.414
What's that?You are not

17:04.458 --> 17:05.807
to board the Gorshkovagain.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.852
Excuse me?That vessel

17:07.896 --> 17:10.768
may very well be in American
territorial waters, but...

17:10.812 --> 17:14.250
my government did not formally
give you permission to go in.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.991
There is proprietary
technology on board

17:16.035 --> 17:18.254
that we do not wish to share.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.648
Should you attempt
to board again,

17:20.691 --> 17:23.129
this could be considered
a hostile act.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.916
Is that it?

17:27.959 --> 17:29.657
Yes.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.355
Really good time, guys.
Thank you. Very helpful.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.965
Complete and total
waste of time.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.011
How'd you know that
guy had a sidepiece?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.144
Just a guess-- Malkin's
a Russian bureaucrat,

17:38.187 --> 17:40.842
far away from home,
on an island filled
with beautiful women.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.670
I was playing the odds.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.933
Wow.Hold up.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.891
Yeah, Lou, what do you got?

17:46.935 --> 17:49.981
GROVER: I think our boy Petrov
just left us a bread crumb.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.857
This poor cop was out
driving on patrol,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.338
and then pow,
bullet right in the head.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.383
His cruiser's
missing, too.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.690
We tried to track it down,
but the GPS has been disabled.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.126
Anybody see anything?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.997
Yeah, two witnesses say
they saw a guy in uniform

18:06.041 --> 18:07.869
get into the cruiser
and speed off.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.218
What kind of uniform?

18:09.262 --> 18:11.177
They said it was black
with yellow trim,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.570
kind of like a Navy uniform--
patches on the arms,

18:13.614 --> 18:14.963
stars on the
shoulders.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.356
That's Russian Navy.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.359
It's obviously our guy.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.403
Wait, where you going?

18:20.447 --> 18:22.492
I'm going back to that sub,

18:22.536 --> 18:23.972
make sure it doesn't leave.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.280
We want to catch Petrov,
we need somebody to talk. Danny.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.457
Hey, hey. You know,
you don't have to talk to me

18:30.500 --> 18:32.111
like I'm a dog.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.590
What are you talking about?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.375
You're doing it a lot lately--
here, sit, stay, heel.

18:35.418 --> 18:36.419
I don't like it.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.681
Really?Yeah, really.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.161
Oh. I'm sorry.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.685
You being sarcastic?No, I'm being sincere.

18:41.729 --> 18:44.210
It's just, I-- you don't...

18:44.253 --> 18:46.037
uh, you've never
apologized...

18:46.081 --> 18:48.475
that quickly-- or ever,
for that matter.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.912
Huh.Thank you.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.404
Well...

19:04.447 --> 19:06.014
here we go again.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.650
First he kills your skipper,
then he murders a policeman.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.348
Petrov didn't care
about the mutiny,

19:35.391 --> 19:37.132
he didn't care about
defecting to the U.S.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.004
He has another agenda--
I need to know what it is.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.571
What makes you
think I know?

19:41.615 --> 19:43.138
You served together.
Come on, you're inside

19:43.182 --> 19:45.445
this metal tube 24/7
for three months.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.099
You got to know him
as well as anybody does.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.579
You must have a theory.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.364
I assure you, I do not.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.064
Okay, look, all due respect,

19:56.107 --> 19:57.935
I know that your English
isn't perfect, okay,

19:57.979 --> 20:00.416
so I'm gonna repeat something.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.244
While my team and I were
getting the runaround

20:02.288 --> 20:04.464
from the consul general,
your boy, he killed a cop.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.466
Okay? Killed a
man with a wife,

20:06.509 --> 20:09.251
a man with children--
now, that may not mean
anything to you,

20:09.295 --> 20:12.254
but if you want to get back
to Russia and save face,

20:12.298 --> 20:13.647
you need to help me.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.649
Otherwise, you and
your fellow officers

20:15.692 --> 20:17.607
are gonna be in prison for
the rest of your lives.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.219
But we had nothing to do
with the mutiny.It doesn't matter.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.395
I'm not talking about
a Russian prison.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.006
The President of
the United States

20:25.049 --> 20:26.921
is looking at this
submarine in our harbor

20:26.964 --> 20:28.052
as an act of aggression.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.272
You understand me?

20:30.316 --> 20:34.320
Now, look, if you were forced
to our shores under duress,

20:34.363 --> 20:36.626
I promise you that will
be taken into account,

20:36.670 --> 20:39.455
but only if you cooperate
with this investigation.

20:42.545 --> 20:45.287
JUNIOR:
So I've been trying to track
this cruiser from the moment

20:45.331 --> 20:46.854
it left the crime scene,

20:46.897 --> 20:48.986
but there are so many blind
spots in this neighborhood.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.554
Okay, what about closed-circuit,
ATM cameras, you get those?

20:51.598 --> 20:53.208
Yeah, HPD's on that right now.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.514
All right, good.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.255
Good.Uh, hey, Cap.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.170
I heard, uh, Sergeant Lukela's
hearing was today.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.737
Yeah, the panel's
meeting right now.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.783
I actually wanted to go down
there and give him some support,

21:02.826 --> 21:04.393
but then, you know,
all this happened.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.186
Ah. Thanks.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.579
How long you been there?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.755
Uh, little while.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.192
Didn't you just
get out of the h...

21:21.236 --> 21:23.064
...the hospital?
You're not even cleared

21:23.107 --> 21:24.631
to come back to work
till next week.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.111
What the hell are you
doing here, Jerry

21:27.155 --> 21:29.766
We got a Russian nuclear-powered
attack sub parked on the beach.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.594
Think I'm gonna
sit this one out?

21:31.638 --> 21:32.900
By the way...

21:32.943 --> 21:35.119
you know I totally
predicted this, right?

21:35.163 --> 21:36.599
What, you predicted a guy
launching himself

21:36.643 --> 21:38.949
out of a torpedo tube
to get himself on the island?

21:38.993 --> 21:40.908
No. A Russian invasion
of Hawaii.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.388
Would you stop with that?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.041
There's no Russian invasion.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.434
We don't know that yet.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.480
But I guarantee you
the Pentagon's at DEFCON 3.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.918
Guys. I think I got something.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.137
Oh, hey, Jer. Welcome back.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.314
Mahalo.
All right, so you
know that patrol car

21:55.357 --> 21:56.532
that Petrov stole?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.534
Seems like he accessed
the onboard computer

21:58.578 --> 22:01.320
before it went offline,
and he looked up two names:

22:01.363 --> 22:02.886
Lee and Nancy Sterling.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.714
Okay, here they are.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.369
No records, but
they live in Manoa.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.458
All right, scooter,
take the wheel.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.808
See if you can dig us up
something else. You two with me.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.693
Are you okay?

22:26.736 --> 22:29.391
Yeah, considering
the circumstances, I'm good.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.002
Yeah, I'm not talking
about this submarine thing.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.091
To be honest, you seem
off your game today.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.006
Mm-hmm, yup, I agree, Cap.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.573
Oh, you do, do you?

22:37.617 --> 22:40.620
Yeah, I like to think of myself
as a body language expert.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.796
Yeah? You study other people's
bodies, or just mine?

22:42.839 --> 22:44.363
No, I just, um...

22:44.406 --> 22:46.365
Uh, yeah, yes.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.670
Uh, a phone call.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.759
Saved by the bell, yeah.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.195
Go, Jerry.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.414
JERRY:
Background on the Sterlings.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.720
Lee works as a civilian mechanic

22:53.763 --> 22:55.678
at Hickam Air Force Base,
and Nancy teaches

22:55.722 --> 22:56.853
at a school nearby.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.333
They moved here eight years ago

22:58.377 --> 23:00.596
from the mainland.
No children.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.250
A quick look
at social media suggests

23:02.293 --> 23:03.817
they lead
a pretty uneventful life.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.645
All right, how about financials
and cell phone records?

23:05.688 --> 23:06.646
I ran both.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.125
No apparent ties to our suspect,

23:08.169 --> 23:09.300
or Russia, for that matter.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.432
This doesn't make sense.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.607
JUNIOR:
Yeah, they sound

23:11.651 --> 23:13.043
like a regular couple.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.045
Why would Petrov be interested
in them?

23:15.089 --> 23:18.005
Well, there's a squad car
up ahead.

23:23.576 --> 23:27.014
It's Officer Shannon's car,
the one Petrov stole.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.873
Tani?

24:20.415 --> 24:22.373
What's your name?

24:31.948 --> 24:33.384
He said you don't
look Hawaiian.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.519
You don't look like a murderer.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.130
You look like a man
who wanted a better life.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.188
What you got
for us, Doc?

24:54.231 --> 24:55.885
Well, it appears
both victims were tortured

24:55.929 --> 24:57.191
before they were drowned.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.020
I found contact burns
on their hands and feet.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.282
So, they were electrocuted?

25:01.325 --> 25:02.675
It would appear so.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.546
We need to get an autopsy
on 'em right away.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.069
See if that tells us
anything else.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.723
I'm on it.
TANI:
All right, so, Petrov--

25:07.767 --> 25:10.247
he breaks in here, he tortures
these people, and then he bails?

25:10.291 --> 25:12.206
Why? That doesn't make sense.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.730
It's weird, but it
damn sure ain't random.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.210
These people are
all connected.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.559
Hey?
Yeah.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.430
I found Petrov's
uniform inside.

25:19.474 --> 25:20.867
I'm guessing he changed

25:20.910 --> 25:22.912
into some of Mr. Sterling's
clothes before he left.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.567
Does it look like anything
else is missing?
No.

25:25.611 --> 25:26.786
There's a safe in there,

25:26.829 --> 25:27.917
but it don't look
like it's been touched.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.224
Hang on.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.966
It's McGarrett.
McGarrett,

25:33.009 --> 25:34.445
you okay?STEVE: Yeah, I am.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.925
And I might have some answers.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.623
Listen, I just interviewed
a crew member

25:37.666 --> 25:40.582
who attended the Moscow Naval
Institute with our suspect.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.105
Now according to the XO,

25:42.149 --> 25:44.238
he was a trusted confidant.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.631
This guy seems to think

25:45.674 --> 25:48.111
that Petrov could be here
on a revenge mission.

25:48.155 --> 25:49.504
Revenge for what?

25:49.548 --> 25:50.940
When Petrov was nine years old,

25:50.984 --> 25:54.465
both of his parents
were murdered in front of him.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.598
Now, apparently, the killer

25:56.642 --> 25:59.340
went on to become
a deep cover spy for the GRU.

25:59.383 --> 26:02.082
Petrov has been hunting
this person for years.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.910
Well, it looks like
he found them.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.803
Uncle, you might

27:10.846 --> 27:12.805
want to come see this.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.635
Oh, you talking to me?

27:16.678 --> 27:18.680
I know you ain't just
call me "uncle."

27:18.724 --> 27:20.682
Locals use it
as a sign of respect.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.379
How long have you lived
on this island?

27:22.423 --> 27:23.598
Long enough to know

27:23.642 --> 27:25.469
when somebody's using it
to call you "old."

27:25.513 --> 27:28.734
Well, you areold,
but I was being respectful.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.693
Youth is truly
wasted on the young.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.391
Age before beauty.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.264
Beauty before the beast.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.147
TANI:
Wow.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.062
Some straight-up
James Bond stuff in here.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.986
TANI: Oh...

28:04.030 --> 28:06.249
That's my bad.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.338
At least my old ass knew
not to touch nothin'.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.690
We probably should go.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.740
GROVER: Well, the FBI's here.
They've taken jurisdiction

28:18.784 --> 28:20.133
over the crime scene.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.223
They got a team in the house
right now, scrubbing it.

28:23.266 --> 28:26.052
Sounds like Lee and Nancy were
a real-life Boris and Natasha.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.271
I don't get the reference.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.100
Rocky & Bullwinkle. Like Rocky?
Like Stallone Rocky?

28:31.144 --> 28:32.536
Oh.DANNY: No, not... No.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.842
STEVE:
What?

28:33.886 --> 28:35.278
Can we stay on point
here, please?

28:35.322 --> 28:36.932
If the Sterlings were,

28:36.976 --> 28:39.456
in fact,
deep cover Russian spooks,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.067
do we know if they
were part of a cell?

28:41.110 --> 28:43.112
Yeah, the Feds are
looking into it.

28:43.156 --> 28:44.418
All right, what about Petrov?
Any leads?

28:44.461 --> 28:45.549
GROVER:
No, not yet.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.551
The Sterlings' cars are
both still here,

28:47.595 --> 28:49.118
along with the police unit,

28:49.162 --> 28:50.903
so he must have stolen a car
right here in the neighborhood.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.861
HPD is going door to door
trying to figure out

28:52.905 --> 28:55.037
which one it was.
We'll get an alert out.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.170
All right. I got Noelani
on the other line.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.214
Let me hit you back.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.608
Hi, Noelani.
Go ahead.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.566
I'm in the middle
of my autopsy on Lee Sterling

29:02.610 --> 29:03.959
and came across
something curious.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.352
STEVE:
Okay, what's that?

29:05.395 --> 29:06.745
Well, before he died,
Mr. Sterling went

29:06.788 --> 29:08.137
into cardiac arrest.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.878
It probably happened while
he was being tortured.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.271
But what's interesting is

29:11.314 --> 29:13.273
is that he also had
two broken ribs.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.144
Plus, I found some blood
in his chest wall.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.712
Both injuries are consistent
with CPR.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.670
Right, okay.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.064
So, why would he
torture this guy,

29:22.108 --> 29:23.979
bring him back to life
and then-- just to, what,

29:24.023 --> 29:25.154
torture him some more?

29:25.198 --> 29:26.416
Wait a minute--
unless he wasn't

29:26.460 --> 29:28.070
torturing them
out of revenge.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.898
Maybe he was
interrogatingthem.Which would mean

29:29.942 --> 29:31.900
that the Sterlings
were not his target.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.989
Right, but they had
information about whoever was.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.296
All right, Noelani, thank you.
That's really good work.

29:36.339 --> 29:37.514
Thank you.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.125
We got to head back
to the consulate.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.301
Why
He's not gonna say anything.

29:41.344 --> 29:42.389
Well, then we press him harder.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.607
Now that we know
about the Sterlings,

29:43.651 --> 29:45.305
maybe he'll be
a little more forthcoming.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.481
Captain Grover.
Yeah?

29:47.524 --> 29:49.135
Thought you should know,
our evidence team just found

29:49.178 --> 29:52.094
a listening device
hidden inside the house.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.009
Someone bugged the place?AGENT: Yes, ma'am.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.315
The tech makes me
think foreign.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.316
JUNIOR: Well,
I guess the Russians

29:56.359 --> 29:57.796
didn't trust
their own spies.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.058
AGENT: The thing is,
if this house is

29:59.101 --> 30:00.146
currently being monitored,

30:00.189 --> 30:01.495
we have to assume
the Russians are

30:01.538 --> 30:03.802
now aware that two of their
operatives are dead.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.412
They're gonna want
to clean up this mess.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.979
Which means we're gonna see
a few more bodies

30:07.022 --> 30:08.458
before this thing is over.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.069
Great.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.461
STEVE:
Jerry, what do you got?

30:11.505 --> 30:12.985
JERRY: So, I took
another look at the Sterlings'

30:13.028 --> 30:15.074
cell phone records.
It seems a call was placed

30:15.117 --> 30:17.119
from Nancy's cell
after T.O.D.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.338
So it had to have been Petrov.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.643
Okay, who'd he call?

30:19.687 --> 30:21.167
JERRY:
A woman named Monica Shore.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.821
Okay, who is she?

30:22.864 --> 30:24.300
JERRY: A deep background search
says she may be

30:24.344 --> 30:26.172
a Russian sleeper spy
waiting to be activated.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.348
I mean, she's single,
one child--

30:28.391 --> 30:29.828
a teenage daughter.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.133
She seems to be doing a pretty
good job of blending in.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.134
STEVE: All right, Jerry,
what about the call?

30:32.178 --> 30:34.093
Focus on the call.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.529
It lasted only
a few seconds,

30:35.572 --> 30:37.618
so it probably went
to voice mail, but get this.

30:37.661 --> 30:39.272
I pulled up Monica's record,

30:39.315 --> 30:41.404
and it seems 40 minutes
before she got that call,

30:41.448 --> 30:43.276
she got a call from someone
at the Russian consulate.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.409
Aha. So, maybe...
maybe they were calling her

30:46.453 --> 30:47.846
trying to warn her?

30:47.889 --> 30:49.935
Jerry, do me a favor.
Ping Monica's cell, please.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.414
I'm on it.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.856
Okay, got her. She's at
the Russian consulate now.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.901
That's it. She's with her
daughter, probably.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.860
Figures it's the safest
place to be.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.426
Unless Petrov has, in fact,
tracked 'em down.

31:03.470 --> 31:06.429
If that's the case, they're not
gonna be safe for long.

31:30.714 --> 31:31.890
Where'd everybody go?

31:36.242 --> 31:38.026
Blood spatter on the window.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.531
Well, it looks like Petrov's
already been here.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.970
The grounds are empty.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.581
He's got to be inside.Let's move.

32:25.987 --> 32:29.425
All right, we got three floors
to clear-- stay sharp.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.017
PETROV: Where
is Monica Shore?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.149
WOMAN :
I don't know.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.716
PETROV: Tell me
where she went!

32:59.760 --> 33:01.153
You know.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.023
No, I don't.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.372
I-I don't know.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.895
You know her.I don't know.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.593
Yuri, drop it!

33:09.770 --> 33:11.728
GROVER:
Suspect on the move.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.991
East side, second floor.

33:13.034 --> 33:13.992
You okay?

35:25.079 --> 35:26.472
Steve?

35:28.474 --> 35:29.997
You good?

35:36.264 --> 35:40.616
GROVER: All right.
We got the rest of them.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.445
They're in a safe room
in the basement.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.447
Got a headcount of 22.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.449
One of them's got to be the
woman we're looking for.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.594
STEVE:
Monica Shore.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.946
Monica Shore.

36:05.989 --> 36:09.428
Who's Monica Shore?
Step out.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.908
TANI:
Monica Shore,

36:11.952 --> 36:12.822
you're under arrest.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.041
No.
Let's go, let's go.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.129
You can't do this.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.000
She's a spy,
we're taking her with us.

36:18.001 --> 36:18.872
Uh-uh-uh.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.484
Local law enforcement
has no jurisdiction here.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.182
You and I, we've both
been doing things

36:24.225 --> 36:25.487
that we shouldn't
have been doing.

36:25.531 --> 36:26.575
All right?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.490
Let's just call this even.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.202
NEWSMAN: An arrest
at the Russian consulate today

36:44.245 --> 36:45.638
brought to light
the double life

36:45.681 --> 36:47.857
of Honolulu citizen
Monica Shore.

36:47.901 --> 36:52.688
Reports suggest she may have
been a longtime Russian agent

36:52.732 --> 36:54.690
with a deadly past.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.360
♪

37:28.115 --> 37:29.551
NEWSMAN 2:
Breaking news.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.901
A local murder investigation
has lead FBI

37:31.945 --> 37:34.556
to arrest more than a half
dozen deep cover spies.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.906
NEWSWOMAN: Russian sleeper cells
that, up until today,

37:36.950 --> 37:38.734
have only existed
in spy novels...

NEWSMAN 3: Over decades,

local military bases,
government contractors...

of this undercover network.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.777
Hey, yo.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.040
What's, uh,
what's going on?

38:24.084 --> 38:25.781
What does it look like?

38:25.825 --> 38:28.349
It's me putting the project
back on track.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.873
Actually, I'm glad
you two are here.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.136
I tweaked the plan a little.

38:33.180 --> 38:37.010
Nothing big, but you should
have a look at it.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.709
"Tweak the plan a little"?

38:40.753 --> 38:43.451
This is, this is major changes
to the entire lighting concept.

38:43.495 --> 38:46.149
Yeah, mood and ambience
is the key.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.543
You eat with your eyes first.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.416
This is actually
not bad, I like it.

38:51.459 --> 38:54.244
I like it, too, it's good.

38:54.288 --> 38:57.291
That's because, unlike you two
amateurs, I know what I'm doing.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.640
All right.I also got us

38:58.684 --> 39:00.599
a liquor license.
Wait.

39:00.642 --> 39:01.469
How did you do that?
What?

39:01.513 --> 39:02.601
Restaurants go under

39:02.644 --> 39:04.603
all the time,
and when that happens,

39:04.646 --> 39:06.387
their liquor license
just don't go away.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.215
They become inactive.

39:08.258 --> 39:11.523
A smart businessman
can swoop right in,

39:11.566 --> 39:14.526
buy them from them
for pennies on the dollar.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.397
That's what I did.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.094
That is smart.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.400
Why didn't Vito do that?

39:19.444 --> 39:21.184
I don't know, you want
to call him and ask him?

39:21.228 --> 39:23.361
I got one more surprise
for you guys.

39:23.404 --> 39:24.492
Follow me.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.451
This is good.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.500
All right.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.810
Ready?
Yeah.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.594
Hey!

39:39.638 --> 39:41.770
Wow.
:
Hey, man.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.293
DANNY: Very nice.STEVE: That's great.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.469
That's cool.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.426
Look, it's the Italian flag.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.862
I can see that.Come on, man.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.039
I love it, man.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.301
I love it.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.912
Look at that.It's good, it's good.

39:52.955 --> 39:54.957
I got to admit, I was,
I was skeptical at first,

39:55.001 --> 39:58.308
and now, I-I'm happy that
we're doing this with you.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.527
Me, too, brother.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.268
With your tutu's recipes,

40:01.311 --> 40:02.661
McGarrett's
front-of-the-house charm

40:02.704 --> 40:06.273
and my brilliant business
acumen, this could go.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.014
Just do
everything I say,

40:08.057 --> 40:10.930
Kamekona's Italian Bistro
is gonna be a hit.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.889
"Kamekona's Italian Bistro,"
huh?

40:13.933 --> 40:15.891
That's right.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.284
What happened to being
a silent partner?

40:17.327 --> 40:18.981
Not-- we're not gonna...
not going with "Steve's"?

40:19.025 --> 40:20.592
I really love the name
"Steve's." You don't like it?

40:20.635 --> 40:21.941
Branding, brah.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.899
I got name recognition.

40:23.943 --> 40:25.901
On this rock,
"Kamekona" is synonymous

40:25.945 --> 40:27.816
with good, quality food.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.297
Trust me,
we'll slay this.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.431
Flippa, document
this historic occasion, please.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.258
Hey, what'd I tell you? I tell
you, this is gonna be fun.

40:35.302 --> 40:36.434
Fun? I don't know.
Yeah.

40:36.477 --> 40:37.522
I don't know
if "fun" is the word

40:37.565 --> 40:38.958
I would choose, but okay.Okay?

40:39.001 --> 40:40.089
Three Amigos.STEVE: Yeah.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.308
Let's see some smiles.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.702
Say "money!"

40:43.745 --> 40:45.617
Money.
Bankrupt.

40:51.710 --> 40:52.667
Hey.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.016
Hi.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.148
You okay?

40:55.191 --> 40:56.366
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Um...

40:56.410 --> 40:59.457
Come in, I-I want
to show you something.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.419
Does this have something to do

41:05.463 --> 41:08.161
with what you wanted
to talk about?

41:10.032 --> 41:11.425
Okay, so you
ain't smiling.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.340
Can't be good.All right,

41:13.383 --> 41:14.863
you know I came over here
the other day,

41:14.907 --> 41:16.735
I was watering the plants,
I checked the mail for Adam.

41:16.778 --> 41:18.301
When the smoke detector
was going off,

41:18.345 --> 41:19.651
I was looking for batteries.

41:22.175 --> 41:24.003
And I-I found something.

41:28.050 --> 41:32.925
The caliber of the gun matches
the slug found in Noriko.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.927
Adam's sister.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.798
Mm-hmm.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.321
Y-You don't think...

41:40.193 --> 41:41.368
Tani, come on.

41:41.411 --> 41:43.370
There has to be an
explanation; I-I mean,

41:43.413 --> 41:45.154
Noriko, she had
a lot of enemies.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.982
Uh, this-this is Adam

41:47.026 --> 41:48.854
we're talking about; there's
no way he's gonna take the law

41:48.897 --> 41:50.508
into his own hands,
and go on a vendetta.

41:50.551 --> 41:51.639
Sure.

41:51.683 --> 41:53.467
But the day that Noriko
was murdered,

41:53.511 --> 41:54.903
I saw Adam at the M.E.'s office.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.950
Hey. And he told me...

41:57.993 --> 41:59.517
Hey. ...that as far as
he was concerned,

41:59.560 --> 42:01.431
sending her to jail
is letting her off easy.

42:01.475 --> 42:04.739
He said that he thought that
she deserved worse than that.

42:04.783 --> 42:07.002
Look what she got.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.963
What am I
supposed to do?

42:11.006 --> 42:12.312
What do you mean?

42:12.355 --> 42:14.575
I mean, do I tell McGarrett?

42:14.619 --> 42:17.535
Yeah. Yeah, I think you have to.

42:17.578 --> 42:18.840
All right, but...

42:21.451 --> 42:23.541
Adam just saved
my brother's life.

42:23.584 --> 42:25.586
I'm supposed
to repay him

42:25.630 --> 42:26.718
by turning him in?

42:26.761 --> 42:27.675
Look, Tani,

42:27.719 --> 42:29.416
I get it, okay, he's our friend.

42:29.459 --> 42:33.028
But you're a cop,
and you took an oath.

42:33.072 --> 42:36.205
If Adam killed his sister,
you need to do the right thing.
