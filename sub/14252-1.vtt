WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:07.870
Citizens of Earth,
your destiny is in my hands.

00:07.941 --> 00:11.342
Those of you who acquiesce
to my demands

00:11.411 --> 00:13.936
will be treated fairly.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.744
Oppose me, and you face
a dire fate indeed

00:18.818 --> 00:23.050
as my slaves in the mines
of Mercury.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.956
You have one hour.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.323
You'll never get away with this.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.919
Oh, but l shall.

00:29.996 --> 00:33.329
Your once-proud country
will fall to its knees.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.892
How ironic that l am
using your rocket ship

00:37.003 --> 00:41.064
to lead my space force
into battle.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.801
You're wrong, Chaotica.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.400
Before you came on board,

00:44.511 --> 00:47.002
someone pushed
the self-destruct button.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.672
ln three minutes,
we'll all be dead.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.114
No!

00:53.219 --> 00:55.187
The jig is up, Your Majesty.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.019
Captain Proton.

00:58.124 --> 01:01.252
Spaceman First Class,
Protector of Earth

01:01.327 --> 01:05.764
Scourge of lntergalactic Evil...
at your service.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.891
But l saw you fall
into the fiery mouth

01:08.034 --> 01:09.092
of that volcano.

01:09.202 --> 01:12.228
lt takes more than a little lava
to stop Captain Proton.

01:12.338 --> 01:16.274
Now, l want you to call off
your invasion

01:16.376 --> 01:19.174
and give me back my rocket ship.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.475
There is one force
in this universe

01:21.548 --> 01:23.379
that even you cannot defeat.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.617
The same to you.

01:27.687 --> 01:28.619
Doc.

01:28.688 --> 01:29.620
Mr. Paris.

01:29.689 --> 01:30.621
l should have known

01:30.690 --> 01:32.123
it was you
monopolizing the holodeck.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.660
Who is this insolent fool?

01:34.727 --> 01:37.662
Uh, he's one of our men.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.823
Computer, adjust the Doctor's
spectral frequency.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.197
l have no interest
in your frivolous fantasy.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.770
l'm here to rehearse a duet
from Don Carlo

01:44.838 --> 01:46.931
and you've already gone
three minutes into my sched...

01:47.040 --> 01:48.007
Enough!

01:48.141 --> 01:49.665
Robot, attack.

01:53.413 --> 01:54.675
Destroy them.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.305
Start with him.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.940
Computer, freeze program.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.518
Doc, this is the final chapter--

02:02.589 --> 02:05.149
''Satan's Robot
Conquers the World.''

02:05.225 --> 02:06.283
We can't stop now.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.350
Does the phrase
''to be continued''

02:08.428 --> 02:09.690
mean anything to you?

02:09.762 --> 02:10.693
Your opera can wait.

02:10.763 --> 02:12.993
This program is a waste
of photonic energy.

02:13.066 --> 02:13.998
Oh, really?

02:14.067 --> 02:15.466
Take a look around you.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.264
This is how the 20th century
saw the future.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.599
We are studying sociology.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.334
Perhaps you can teach a course
at Starfleet Academy--

02:22.408 --> 02:25.571
''Satan's Robot:
An historical overview.''

02:30.183 --> 02:31.480
Bridge to Holodeck 1.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.109
What's going on down there?

02:33.186 --> 02:34.744
Oh, nothing, Commander.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.652
Just a little power surge.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.691
Says here the hologrid
just blew out.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.316
We're fixing it now, sir.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.587
Well, make it quick.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.357
The last thing we need
is a broken holodeck.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.261
Seven, l want good news.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.560
That's an order.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.964
Then l must disobey.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.002
l have no good news to report.

02:51.137 --> 02:54.163
l've completed an astrometric
scan of the entire region.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.834
There are no star systems
within 2,500 light-years.

02:56.943 --> 02:57.875
Nothing?

02:57.944 --> 02:58.876
Nothing.

02:58.945 --> 03:00.810
Why can't we see any stars
beyond that?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.405
There are heavy concentrations
of theta radiation.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.882
lt has occluded our sensors.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.315
Any other ships out there?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.183
None. We are alone.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.421
Every sailor's nightmare.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.050
Commander?

03:14.127 --> 03:16.857
lt's like being becalmed
in the middle of the ocean.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.227
lf it weren't for sensors,

03:18.298 --> 03:20.289
we wouldn't even know
we were at warp.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.857
We've only been crossing
this expanse for two months

03:22.936 --> 03:24.528
and we're already feeling
the strain.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.070
How do we last
another two years?

03:26.139 --> 03:28.733
We will adapt.

03:28.841 --> 03:30.809
Easier said than done.

03:30.910 --> 03:34.641
Shall l inform
the Captain of my findings?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.948
No.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.052
l'll tell her.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:42.575 --> 05:46.067
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 52081.2.

05:46.145 --> 05:49.342
lt's been 53 days since we
entered this desolate region.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.406
lf we want to continue
our course toward home,

05:51.484 --> 05:53.611
we have no choice
but to cross it.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.587
We won't have an opportunity to
take on fresh supplies or fuel,

05:56.656 --> 05:59.591
so l've ordered all departments
to create an energy reserve.

05:59.659 --> 06:02.594
We're using power cells
to stockpile deuterium.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.596
This won't be much
of a briefing.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.131
There's nothing new to report.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.394
Humor me.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.968
All right. Let's see.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.061
Warp core's at peak efficiency,

06:12.171 --> 06:15.436
just like last week
and the week before that.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.170
And my Engineering staff
is going stir-crazy.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.711
Thanks.

06:19.812 --> 06:20.744
Ensign?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.678
Nada.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.740
Can you be more specific?

06:24.817 --> 06:27.843
All systems are operating
within normal parameters.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.854
Anything new on sensors?

06:29.922 --> 06:32.083
l detected a sudden increase
of theta radiation

06:32.158 --> 06:33.090
in the vicinity.

06:33.159 --> 06:33.887
Source?

06:33.993 --> 06:35.119
Unknown.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.456
Could be worth a look.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.360
Finally, some excitement--

06:38.431 --> 06:40.296
radiation.

06:41.868 --> 06:44.336
Next piece of business.

06:44.437 --> 06:45.699
Crew morale.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.397
Deteriorating...

06:47.507 --> 06:48.633
obviously.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.106
l have a few suggestions

06:50.176 --> 06:52.144
that might boost
people's spirits.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.371
Please.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.641
Rotate crew assignments.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.684
Add variety
to the daily routine.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.514
l myself wouldn't mind
squeezing in

07:00.586 --> 07:02.076
a little tactical training.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.123
Noted.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.988
And the holodecks
have been in high demand.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.653
l was thinking...
we could install a few emitters

07:09.729 --> 07:10.696
in Cargo Bay 2--

07:10.763 --> 07:12.390
turn it into a third holodeck.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.432
Hear, hear.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.989
See to it, Harry.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.659
One other item, sir.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.535
Point of, uh, concern
among some of the crew.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.233
lt's...

07:22.308 --> 07:23.639
Well, it's the Captain.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.540
She's been a bit elusive lately.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.545
What's your point?

07:27.613 --> 07:29.547
People take comfort
in talking to her.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.413
When they see that the Captain's
happy, they're happy.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.885
Rumor has it
she never leaves her quarters.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.012
Captain's privilege.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.147
She'll come to the Bridge
if and when she's needed.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.452
Spare us the protocol, Chakotay.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.152
lt's pretty odd,
you've got to admit it.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.159
lt's her choice.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.320
She can run this ship

07:43.396 --> 07:44.795
from wherever the hell
she wants to.

07:44.864 --> 07:45.831
Understood?

07:47.066 --> 07:48.897
Yeah.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.558
Sure.

07:51.838 --> 07:55.706
We're all feeling the pressure,
including me.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.869
Listen, maybe we've got
the wrong attitude.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.039
Let's think of this
as a two-year vacation.

08:04.884 --> 08:05.976
Dismissed.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.577
That's a great idea, Harry.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.586
Wow, Harry.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.917
You're a real genius.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.083
How do you come up
with these brilliant ideas?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.717
You're such an optimistic guy.

08:44.222 --> 08:47.784
Computer, lights--
maximum level.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.987
Bergamot tea, hot.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.115
First thing in the morning,
l replicate some curtains.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.428
Predictable.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.930
Hmm?

09:25.998 --> 09:29.161
The Novokovich gambit-- you
always use that opening move.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.429
That's because you always
fall for it.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.870
l feel like we've played
this match a hundred times.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.340
Derada is a game of subtlety.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.742
Too subtle for me.

09:39.812 --> 09:43.339
Hmm. l'll bet.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.815
What's that supposed to mean?

09:44.884 --> 09:48.980
Well, if it doesn't involve
Klingon painsticks...

09:49.055 --> 09:49.987
Good night.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.148
There you go.
Just when l'm winning.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.453
Who's predictable?

09:54.527 --> 09:56.324
You don't want to start a fight
with me right now--

09:56.395 --> 09:57.327
not at 3:00 A.M.

09:57.396 --> 10:00.126
3:00 in the morning,
4:00 in the afternoon--

10:00.199 --> 10:01.257
what's the difference?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.699
You're angry 24 hours a day.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.099
Everything is a joke to you.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.569
Good evening...
or should l say good morning?

10:06.639 --> 10:08.732
l guess you couldn't
sleep, either.

10:08.841 --> 10:11.309
Why sleep when we're
having so much fun?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.537
He's joking, Neelix.
We're all supposed to laugh.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.046
l certainly am laughing

10:15.114 --> 10:17.674
on the inside...
smiling, anyway.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.184
Let's start a new game.
Cards?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.617
A little snack?

10:21.687 --> 10:23.518
No. l have a better idea.

10:23.589 --> 10:27.116
Why don't we make a schedule--
a fight rotation?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.455
We can optimize our resources.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.358
l can start one,
then you can start one...

10:30.429 --> 10:31.919
Please...

10:31.998 --> 10:33.590
l am really tired
of these games.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.065
Well, then don't play them.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.065
Stop!

10:36.168 --> 10:38.568
You are senior officers!

10:38.638 --> 10:41.835
You are supposed to be setting
an example for the rest...

10:41.907 --> 10:44.341
the rest of the crew.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.510
Neelix?

10:46.579 --> 10:47.910
l can't breathe.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.572
Paris to Sick Bay.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.684
Some morale officer
l turned out to be.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.017
l've given you a mild sedative.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.455
lt should control
the urge to hyperventilate

10:59.525 --> 11:02.050
and alleviate
some of your anxiety.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.291
Anxiety? Anxiety's what l feel
when l burn a pot roast.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.357
This... this is more like...

11:08.434 --> 11:10.902
Dizziness? Nausea?
Unspeakable dread?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.301
Yes.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.339
Nihiliphobia--
the fear of nothingness,

11:14.440 --> 11:16.203
or in layman's terms,
the fear of...

11:16.275 --> 11:17.401
nothingness.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.343
lf it's any consolation,
l can relate to it.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.280
l go into a void every
time l'm deactivated--

11:23.349 --> 11:25.874
emptiness, complete
and utter oblivion.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.579
l'll admit, it was
unsettling at first--

11:28.654 --> 11:30.918
the existential horror
of it all...

11:30.990 --> 11:32.514
You're not helping, Doctor.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.354
Sorry.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.056
My point is,
you'll get used to it.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.620
l hope so.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.698
Commander...

11:46.806 --> 11:48.774
am l disturbing you?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.364
No.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.572
ls the Astrometrics Lab
designated for recreational use?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.478
l come here to meditate.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.881
Needless to say,
the view from my quarters

11:58.951 --> 12:00.782
has been less
than stellar lately.

12:00.853 --> 12:04.380
Astronomical phenomena
help you to focus your mind.

12:04.457 --> 12:09.588
Yes. l imagine that each star
represents a single thought.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.189
Meditation--
it rejuvenates you?

12:13.265 --> 12:14.527
lndeed it does.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.591
l suggest you try
Borg regeneration.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.102
lt's much more efficient.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.104
A simple cortical implant
would be required.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.265
Another time, perhaps.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.707
What is it?

12:25.778 --> 12:26.802
Long-range sensors

12:26.879 --> 12:28.210
are detecting
more theta radiation.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.542
Dangerously high levels.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.344
Source?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.351
Unknown.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.411
lt's probably nothing, just...
background theta radiation.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.423
But it could mean
there's someone nearby.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.391
Distance?

12:40.459 --> 12:43.690
Approximately 25 light-years.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.891
lt's a long shot
but alter course.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.696
Yes, ma'am.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.861
lf that's all, Commander...

12:51.971 --> 12:54.132
Actually, l'd like
to make a request.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.538
l've been saving up
my holodeck rations

12:56.609 --> 12:58.839
and l've got
three full hours coming.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.505
Any chance
l might persuade you to join me

13:01.580 --> 13:03.480
for a few rounds of Velocity?

13:03.549 --> 13:05.608
lt'll help clear your mind.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.743
My mind is perfectly clear.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.256
Then what if l told you l'm
not leaving until you join me?

13:11.323 --> 13:13.518
l'd say, ''Have a seat.
lt'll be a while.''

13:14.560 --> 13:16.619
Then l'll be blunt.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.128
You've picked a bad time

13:18.197 --> 13:20.222
to isolate yourself
from the crew.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.894
This ship needs a Captain,
especially now.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.494
Would you be satisfied with

13:26.605 --> 13:29.130
''l'm just catching up
on some reading?''

13:30.209 --> 13:32.871
l'm not sure
l understand it myself.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.412
lt started when we
entered this...

13:34.480 --> 13:35.913
What does the crew call it?

13:35.981 --> 13:36.948
The Void.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.916
Charming.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.750
Oh, what l wouldn't give
for a few Borg cubes about now--

13:42.822 --> 13:45.188
anything for
a little distraction.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.150
Strange as it sounds...

13:49.228 --> 13:50.923
l almost long for the days

13:50.996 --> 13:53.260
when we were under
constant attack.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.663
No time to stop and think

13:54.733 --> 13:57.327
about how we got stranded
in the Delta Quadrant.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.199
How did we end up here,
Chakotay?

14:02.241 --> 14:03.435
Answer me.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.707
We were faced
with a difficult choice.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.645
We had the means to get home,

14:09.715 --> 14:12.445
but using it would have put
an innocent people at risk

14:12.518 --> 14:13.780
so we decided to stay.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.413
No... no, no.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.456
l decided to stay.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.617
l made that choice
for everyone.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.058
We're alive and well

14:22.127 --> 14:24.891
and we've gathered enough
data about this Quadrant

14:25.030 --> 14:27.863
to keep Starfleet scientists
busy for decades.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.766
Our mission's been a success.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.838
Very same words
l've been telling myself

14:32.905 --> 14:34.998
for the past four years.

14:35.107 --> 14:37.735
But then we hit this Void,

14:37.810 --> 14:41.769
and l started to realize
how empty those words sound.

14:41.847 --> 14:42.677
Kathryn...

14:42.748 --> 14:45.342
l made an error in judgment,
Chakotay.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.817
lt was shortsighted
and it was selfish

14:47.887 --> 14:51.050
and now all of us
are paying for my mistake.

14:51.123 --> 14:54.024
So if you don't mind, Commander,
l'll pass on that little game.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.896
And l'll leave shipboard morale
in your capable hands.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.502
lf the crew asks for me,

15:04.603 --> 15:07.970
tell them the Captain
sends her regards.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.180
Sir.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.376
Relax, Ensign.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.918
Anything to report?

15:53.986 --> 15:55.886
Not even a stray electron,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.617
but l did finish
writing my concerto.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.852
l call it Echoes of the Void.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.655
Got a minute?

16:02.728 --> 16:04.286
Too many, in fact.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.422
Tell me what you think.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.071
Now, when we last saw
our heroes,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.807
they had just retaken
their rocket ship.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.712
Dr. Chaotica had escaped,

16:24.783 --> 16:27.343
but he left behind
his trusty robot

16:27.419 --> 16:29.444
to foil Captain Proton.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.386
My designation?

16:31.457 --> 16:35.086
Ah, right.
You're Constance Goodheart.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.684
You're... my secretary.

16:36.762 --> 16:37.888
Secretary?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.591
Yeah. You tag along
on all the missions.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.157
Now, l want you to keep
the robot occupied

16:43.268 --> 16:44.496
while l save Earth.

16:44.603 --> 16:48.266
Computer, run program.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.842
Citizen of Earth, surrender.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.240
Do not resist.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.108
l am Borg.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.272
Surrender...

16:57.216 --> 16:59.184
The robot has been neutralized.

16:59.251 --> 17:00.275
May l leave now?

17:01.720 --> 17:02.948
Come on, Seven.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.648
Give it a chance.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.883
The galaxy's at stake.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.595
We've dropped out of warp.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.400
We're losing power.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.973
Switch to auxiliary.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.531
No effect.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.598
l was hoping
for a change of pace,

17:54.706 --> 17:57.470
but a blackout isn't exactly
what l had in mind.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.341
l'll try tapping
into the energy reserves.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.461
Double-check the radio relay.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.560
Man the lock plate.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.037
Yeah, l'll get on that
right away.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.278
Get inside
those plasma injectors!

18:40.352 --> 18:42.752
lnfuse them manually
if you have to.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.345
Lieutenant...

18:44.423 --> 18:45.856
Just a second.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.017
l'm not sure
how to work this thing.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.299
Captain Proton to the rescue.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.869
lt's not exactly
Starfleet issue.

19:10.849 --> 19:13.283
Shipwide power loss?

19:13.352 --> 19:16.446
Everything's off-line--
main power, auxiliary...

19:16.522 --> 19:19.650
lndependent subsystems
are operational--

19:19.725 --> 19:22.626
environmental controls,
holodecks...

19:22.694 --> 19:26.323
Reroute power from this holodeck
to the emergency relays.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.833
Yes, ma'am.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.836
No luck.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.702
The hologrid is frozen.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.048
Neelix.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.009
Don't mind me.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.019
There's been a power loss.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.850
Nothing to worry about.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.515
Who's worried?

19:52.591 --> 19:54.024
Come on.

19:54.092 --> 19:57.528
Take deep breaths--
nice and slow.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.029
That's it.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.865
Bingo!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.561
We've got partial sensors.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.370
l found the cause
of our power drain.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.433
lt's some kind
of dampening field.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.409
The source is
off the port bow.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.413
That's about all l can tell you.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.880
On screen.

20:18.984 --> 20:22.750
Do we have the power
to launch a photon torpedo?

20:22.821 --> 20:24.755
Maybe one. Why?

20:24.823 --> 20:26.757
Perhaps we could
shed some light

20:26.825 --> 20:28.417
on our predicament.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.358
l'm reconfiguring the torpedo

20:30.429 --> 20:32.954
to emit a sustained
polyluminous burst.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.293
A ''warp flare.''

20:34.366 --> 20:35.799
Precisely.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.669
l need something
to pry open this hatch.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.415
Computer,
disengage safety protocols!

21:09.134 --> 21:10.533
l saw something!

21:10.636 --> 21:12.103
Over there.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.068
l'm telling you,
l saw something.

21:19.144 --> 21:22.602
l may be nihiliphobic,
but my eyes work just fine.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.456
l can hear breathing.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.435
Follow me.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.494
Yes, ma'am.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.473
Torpedo reconfigured.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.034
Away.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.881
l can barely see
the injector ports.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.817
How about a little light
over here?

22:02.854 --> 22:04.344
We can do better than that.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.254
This power cell should be enough

22:06.325 --> 22:08.350
to get emergency power
back on line.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.689
Up here!

22:09.761 --> 22:12.286
We'll hook it up directly
to the EPS manifold.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.857
Emergency power just came back.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.196
We've got tactical.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.565
Raising shields.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.401
The warp core's on line.

22:22.474 --> 22:23.907
Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.569
The dampening field
has been blocked, Captain.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.704
We are surrounded
by three alien vessels.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.748
17 intruders are on board.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.111
The ships aren't
responding to hails.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.177
We do have weapons on line.

22:36.254 --> 22:40.554
Tuvok, target the ship
off our port bow.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.855
Fire a few warning shots.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.593
Shields down to 64 percent.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.135
Do we have propulsion?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.671
Not yet.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.741
He was attacked by an intruder.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.003
These burns are severe.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.475
l disabled the alien.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.876
lt may still be alive.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.403
Bring it to Sick Bay.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.211
Shields are down.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.183
They're reinitializing
the dampening field.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.412
We're losing power.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.388
Not again.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.292
They've stopped their attack.

23:17.362 --> 23:19.262
They're beaming off the ship.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.026
There's another vessel
approaching.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.939
We're being hailed.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.805
On screen.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.936
l'm Lieutenant Commander Tuvok
of the Federation...

23:36.081 --> 23:40.040
l had to fire 13 spatial charges
to drive those ships off.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.780
l expect to be compensated.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.254
Of course.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.952
Now...

23:49.094 --> 23:51.062
tell me...

23:51.129 --> 23:54.360
what are you doing
in the middle of nowhere?

24:03.375 --> 24:06.811
The bio-filters are detecting
high levels of theta radiation.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.004
Compensate.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.137
Welcome aboard.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.377
l'm afraid we'll have
to talk here.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.749
You appear to be leaking.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.448
Yes, yes. My isolation suit.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.114
Don't be alarmed.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.421
We'd prefer to be
on the safe side, Mister...?

24:21.493 --> 24:22.755
Emck. Controller Emck,

24:22.828 --> 24:25.228
Malon export vessel,
eleventh gradient.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.889
lt's a pleasure to meet you

24:26.998 --> 24:28.090
and a relief...

24:28.166 --> 24:30.430
l'd advise you
to turn around immediately.

24:30.535 --> 24:32.435
There are more
of those creatures ahead--

24:32.504 --> 24:33.471
thousands of vessels.

24:33.572 --> 24:36.564
They are almost impossible
to detect.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.336
You won't survive
another attack.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.775
We can't go back.

24:39.845 --> 24:43.508
We're crossing this
expanse to reach our home.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.709
Mmm.

24:45.784 --> 24:49.686
Then, uh... it appears
you'll be coming with me.

24:49.754 --> 24:50.743
What do you mean?

24:50.822 --> 24:53.950
There's a spatial vortex
a few light-years from here.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.186
lt leads directly
to the other side

24:56.261 --> 24:57.489
of the expanse.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.996
We've been using it for years.

25:00.065 --> 25:01.930
That would get us
out of the Void

25:02.033 --> 25:04.263
and cut two years
off our journey home.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.700
Well, thank you again.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.169
l'm curious, Mr. Emck.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.797
What are you doing here--

25:08.907 --> 25:11.341
besides rescuing
starships in distress?

25:11.409 --> 25:14.845
Ah. l'm on a...
transport mission.

25:14.913 --> 25:16.175
My sensors tell me

25:16.248 --> 25:19.308
that one of the creatures
is still aboard your ship.

25:19.384 --> 25:21.113
lt was injured
during the attack.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.551
Our Doctor's treating it.

25:22.621 --> 25:23.553
Why?

25:23.622 --> 25:24.884
Enough questions.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.982
Give me the creature
and l'll take you to the vortex.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.788
Well, my apologies, Mr. Emck,

25:29.861 --> 25:32.421
but l'd like to know
what's going on here.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.488
Are you at war
with these beings?

25:34.566 --> 25:36.397
None of your concern.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.662
Your vessel seems to be leaking

25:38.770 --> 25:41.136
large amounts
of theta radiation.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.869
What kind of transport mission
are you on exactly?

25:44.943 --> 25:48.037
My ship will depart
in two hours.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.547
Cooperate or stay behind.

25:50.615 --> 25:55.814
l won't be coming to your rescue
when the creatures return.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.378
l'm finished here.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.962
l think it's time we heard
the other side of the story.

26:14.372 --> 26:15.430
Watch your step.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.508
l've had to lower the lights.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.306
My patient is extremely
photosensitive.

26:20.378 --> 26:22.676
That could explain
why they dampened our power.

26:22.747 --> 26:23.714
My feelings exactly.

26:23.782 --> 26:24.874
From what l can tell,

26:25.016 --> 26:26.984
this life-form may be
indigenous to the Void.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.178
His physiology

26:28.253 --> 26:30.312
has evolved to survive
in complete darkness.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.719
His condition?

26:31.790 --> 26:32.882
Minor injuries--

26:32.958 --> 26:34.823
phaser wounds
to the chest and neck.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.054
But that's the least
of his problems.

26:37.128 --> 26:39.323
He's dying, Captain.

26:39.397 --> 26:43.265
Every organ is degrading
at the cellular level.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.598
Theta radiation poisoning.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.296
The final stages.

26:47.405 --> 26:50.431
My guess is he's been exposed
to it over a long period.

26:50.542 --> 26:51.873
There's nothing l can do.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.343
l'd like a word with him.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.579
l'm Kathryn Janeway,
Captain of this vessel.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.086
You are allies with the Malon.

27:03.154 --> 27:04.246
No.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.153
We're simply trying
to cross this region.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.692
We never met the Malon
before today.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.728
They will want me.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.093
Well, l have no intention
of giving you to them.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.426
You're not a captive here.

27:16.034 --> 27:16.932
Doctor.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.595
Are you at war with the Malon?

27:19.704 --> 27:21.569
Their ships are poison.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.664
The theta radiation.

27:22.774 --> 27:23.763
They're killing us.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.604
Why?
What do they want from you?

27:25.677 --> 27:27.838
Nothing.

27:27.912 --> 27:31.473
This will help
alleviate the pain.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.483
l don't understand.

27:33.551 --> 27:35.212
We were ignorant.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.844
We attacked you.

27:36.921 --> 27:38.013
Forgive us.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.818
Of course, but l
need to understand.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.882
You say the Malon are
killing your people,

27:41.993 --> 27:43.290
but there must be a reason.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.886
They're poisoning our space.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.658
We don't know why.

27:50.535 --> 27:51.832
He's in respiratory distress.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.665
We need to get him
back to his people.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.262
They might know
how to treat him.

27:55.373 --> 27:57.841
l will show you how.

27:57.909 --> 27:58.841
l need a workstation.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.002
Route it to the helm.

28:00.111 --> 28:03.603
lf you enter the coordinates,
my pilot will set a course.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.479
l am grateful.

28:05.550 --> 28:07.108
Take the Bridge.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.652
l'll stay here.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.348
We still don't have a defense
against their dampening field.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.913
lf they decide
to attack again...

28:12.991 --> 28:14.390
l'm confident they won't.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.791
Finally something
to put in my logbook.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.627
Tuvok.

28:28.139 --> 28:29.731
l need your advice.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.809
A first.

28:31.876 --> 28:35.471
Look, l realize
we're not exactly best friends.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.209
From day one, we've kept
each other at arm's length,

28:38.283 --> 28:40.843
but l've always respected
your judgment,

28:40.919 --> 28:43.046
and right now, l could use
a little Vulcan clarity.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.089
Proceed.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.589
lt's the Captain.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.388
As you may have noticed, she's
isolated herself from the crew.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.689
She believes that she made

28:50.762 --> 28:52.491
an error in judgment
four years ago--

28:52.564 --> 28:54.657
that she's responsible
for stranding Voyager

28:54.733 --> 28:55.825
in the Delta Quadrant.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.060
She told you?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.465
No.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.131
l've been observing her behavior
for the past four years.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.708
Guilt has been
her constant companion.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.505
You've known her
longer than anyone.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.205
Have you ever
seen her like this?

29:08.279 --> 29:09.405
Only once.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.540
lt was during her first year

29:11.616 --> 29:14.244
as a Commander
on the USS Billings.

29:14.319 --> 29:17.152
She sent an away team
to survey a volcanic moon.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.918
Their shuttle was damaged
by a magma eruption

29:19.991 --> 29:22.755
and three crew members
were severely injured.

29:22.827 --> 29:25.352
The next day, she returned
to the moon, alone,

29:25.430 --> 29:26.761
to complete the survey.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.389
She wanted the crew to know

29:28.466 --> 29:30.957
that their suffering
had not been in vain.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.525
She could have been killed.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.332
Seeking redemption.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.929
Precisely.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.476
Captain Janeway's methods
are unorthodox.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.478
lt is her strength as a leader,

29:41.546 --> 29:44.982
but, unfortunately, it is also
her greatest weakness.

29:45.049 --> 29:47.108
Stubborn as a Klingon.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.812
To put it mildly.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.879
lf she tries something
like that again,

29:52.023 --> 29:53.490
l want to be ready

29:53.558 --> 29:55.856
and l'm going
to need your support.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.497
We're at the coordinates.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.000
All stop.
Shields up.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.034
Tuvok.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.071
Nothing on sensors.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.639
Bridge to Captain.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.139
We've arrived.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.470
Stand by.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.536
They're here, but l must
tell them you are a friend.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.740
Your communications system?

30:25.190 --> 30:26.680
l'm picking up photonic surges.

30:26.758 --> 30:27.850
They're all around us.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.228
Captain, we've got company--
eight ships.

30:34.299 --> 30:35.766
12 more approaching.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.802
Let's run a full bio-scan.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.200
We have lived here

30:39.270 --> 30:42.603
for millions of years
undisturbed,

30:42.674 --> 30:44.574
until the Malon came.

30:44.642 --> 30:48.009
Captain, every one of them
appears to be suffering

30:48.112 --> 30:50.012
from theta radiation exposure.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.378
We tell them
they are killing us.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.714
They won't listen.

30:54.786 --> 30:57.016
We try to stop them.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.748
They're too strong.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.848
What about the vortex,
can you close it?

31:00.959 --> 31:01.891
Keep them out?

31:01.926 --> 31:04.759
We don't know how.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.831
Your ship is powerful.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.494
Your people resourceful.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.900
We need your help.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.436
Bridge to Captain.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.496
They're locking onto the alien
in Sick Bay.

31:16.608 --> 31:17.666
Lower the shields.

31:17.775 --> 31:20.073
Will you help us?!

31:34.259 --> 31:35.954
Poison.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.722
The vessel is ejecting
massive quantities

31:37.795 --> 31:38.887
of contaminated antimatter.

31:38.963 --> 31:40.726
Their cargo holds
are loaded with it--

31:40.798 --> 31:42.493
over 90 million isotons.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.364
Hail them.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.458
Captain.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.800
You've decided to join us.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.838
Send the creature to...

31:48.907 --> 31:49.896
That won't be possible.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.566
We've returned him
to his people.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.008
You wanted the life-form
because you were afraid

31:54.145 --> 31:57.012
we'd uncover your...
transport mission.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.013
l said this was
none of your concern.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.516
Well, it is now.

32:00.618 --> 32:02.745
You're using their space
as a dumping ground

32:02.787 --> 32:05.551
for your antimatter waste.
Why?

32:05.623 --> 32:09.889
My civilization produces
over six billion isotons

32:09.961 --> 32:12.623
of industrial byproduct
every day.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.894
This region is
a perfect disposal site.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.195
How convenient-- for you.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.498
A spatial vortex
to the middle of nowhere,

32:20.605 --> 32:22.436
far away from your own system.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.771
Out of sight, out of mind.

32:24.842 --> 32:26.707
The problem is,
somebody lives here.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.904
One species.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.207
One's enough.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.271
We didn't come here
to debate the issue.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.250
We came here to offer
a peaceful solution.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.947
What kind of solution?

32:37.088 --> 32:39.215
My people use antimatter
as well,

32:39.290 --> 32:42.225
but we found ways
to purify the reactant

32:42.293 --> 32:44.158
so there's no toxic waste.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.957
We'll show you.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.588
Guide us through the vortex.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.963
We can meet with your scientists

32:50.068 --> 32:52.366
on the other side,
exchange information.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.438
Show me now.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.633
Stand by for transport.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.472
Commander, take our
guest to Engineering

33:02.547 --> 33:04.139
and give him a demonstration.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.240
Let's turn our sensors
on that vortex.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.251
l want to know exactly
how it works--

33:08.319 --> 33:11.254
just in case diplomacy fails.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.620
Do you intend to destroy it?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.228
The residual antimatter's
then processed

33:19.297 --> 33:20.559
in a transkinetic chamber

33:20.631 --> 33:22.895
where it's broken down
on a subatomic level.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.366
What about the theta radiation?

33:25.470 --> 33:29.497
Oh, it's absorbed by a series
of radiometric converters.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.234
We recycle the energy--

33:31.309 --> 33:33.277
use it to power everything

33:33.378 --> 33:35.608
from life support
to replicators.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.945
We don't have this kind
of conversion technology.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.278
Our scans of your freighter

33:40.351 --> 33:41.943
show that you have
plasma manifolds.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.816
The engineering
principles are the same.

33:43.888 --> 33:45.947
We're not saying this
won't take some effort.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.423
You're looking at several
months of retrofitting,

33:48.493 --> 33:50.222
depending on the size
of your fleet.

33:50.294 --> 33:51.556
All the schematics are here

33:51.629 --> 33:53.529
and we'd be willing
to work with you--

33:53.598 --> 33:54.656
get you started.

33:54.732 --> 33:56.962
We can even provide you
with some converters.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.664
lngenious design.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.935
Our engineers would be pleased.

34:05.309 --> 34:09.473
This would solve a lot
of problems on my world.

34:09.547 --> 34:14.882
Unfortunately, it would also
put me out of business.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.248
Sorry?

34:16.320 --> 34:19.721
Your technology would throw
the waste-export industry

34:19.791 --> 34:20.882
into chaos.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.960
Before long, l'd be obsolete.

34:25.663 --> 34:30.565
Oh, l came here hoping
your claims were exaggerated,

34:30.668 --> 34:33.136
but l can see they're not.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.364
You can keep your solution.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.443
You lying...

34:39.510 --> 34:40.476
B'Elanna.

34:40.578 --> 34:41.943
We went through
this whole song and dance,

34:42.045 --> 34:43.775
and he never had any intention
of working with us.

34:43.848 --> 34:44.940
That's not important.

34:45.049 --> 34:47.313
What matters is
that we're talking now.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.821
We're proposing changes,
some of them difficult,

34:50.888 --> 34:54.255
but progress can also bring
new opportunities.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.987
Given time, this could turn
to your advantage.

34:58.329 --> 35:00.388
l already have the advantage--

35:00.498 --> 35:01.624
the vortex.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.601
No one knows about it
except me and my crew.

35:04.702 --> 35:10.004
By ejecting my cargo here,
l cut expenses in half.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.542
l won't sacrifice that.

35:12.643 --> 35:13.575
l guess mass murder

35:13.644 --> 35:15.578
doesn't factor
into your profit margin.

35:15.646 --> 35:18.843
You care so much
about these creatures, stay.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.010
l'm sorry you won't
listen to reason,

35:23.087 --> 35:25.578
but don't expect us
to walk away from this.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.783
You've scanned my vessel.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.986
You've seen my firepower.

35:30.061 --> 35:34.794
You wouldn't survive ten seconds
in a conflict with me.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.959
Get him out of here.

35:40.705 --> 35:41.672
Ah!

35:46.777 --> 35:47.744
Options?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.473
We fight our way past them--

35:49.547 --> 35:51.208
navigate the vortex on our own.

35:51.282 --> 35:52.476
Once we're on the other side,

35:52.550 --> 35:55.280
we contact the Malon authorities
and blow the whistle on Emck.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.184
We give them
the reclamation technology

35:57.255 --> 35:58.688
and continue on our way home.

35:58.756 --> 35:59.723
Exactly.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.781
Even if we did
get through the vortex,

36:01.893 --> 36:02.825
there's no guarantee

36:02.860 --> 36:04.384
the Malon will
do the right thing--

36:04.462 --> 36:06.396
if Mr. Emck is any indication.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.830
As long as this vortex exists,

36:08.966 --> 36:11.696
the inhabitants
of this region are at risk.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.165
Any chance we could destroy it?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.262
l believe so,

36:16.374 --> 36:17.500
but there's a catch.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.872
We'll have to collapse it
from this end

36:20.011 --> 36:22.878
where it's dimensional
radius is weakest.

36:22.947 --> 36:25.916
We'd be closing
our shortcut out of here.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.884
Two more years in the Void.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.078
l can live with that.

36:30.154 --> 36:32.782
But l'm not sure l can.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.791
Four years ago,

36:34.859 --> 36:38.420
l destroyed the Caretaker's
Array to protect the Ocampa.

36:38.496 --> 36:39.895
That ''act of compassion''

36:39.997 --> 36:42.488
stranded this crew
in the Delta Quadrant.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.296
l'm not about
to give that order again.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.733
This situation is
a little different.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.360
Oh, it's close enough.

36:47.471 --> 36:50.440
l'm asking this crew
to make too big a sacrifice.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.941
l won't make that same mistake.

36:53.077 --> 36:55.875
lf you have another option,
l'm listening.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.916
Chakotay,

36:59.984 --> 37:02.509
there's no one l trust
more than you.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.588
You're a fine First Officer.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.726
Are you ready
to Captain this ship?

37:11.596 --> 37:12.620
Yes.

37:12.697 --> 37:13.959
Assemble the crew.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.613
Captain on the Bridge.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.649
At ease.

37:43.327 --> 37:44.726
Harry, how have you been?

37:44.795 --> 37:45.887
Just fine, ma'am.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.157
Good.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.331
We've missed you, Captain.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.527
Likewise.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.104
l'll make this brief.

37:54.205 --> 37:57.106
Your orders are to proceed
to the vortex.

37:57.174 --> 37:59.165
Use whatever means necessary

37:59.277 --> 38:02.269
to fight your way
past the Malon freighter.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.780
l'll stay behind
in a shuttlecraft

38:04.815 --> 38:06.442
and destroy the vortex.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.077
Tuvok, l'll need
a class-2 shuttle

38:09.153 --> 38:11.178
armed with photon torpedoes.

38:11.255 --> 38:13.189
Tom, set a course for...

38:13.257 --> 38:14.383
Forget it.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.358
We're not going to let you
die out here.

38:16.427 --> 38:18.019
Have a little faith, B'Elanna.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.962
l'll have a shuttle, plenty
of rations. l'll survive.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.091
Alone in the Delta Quadrant?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.497
No offense, but...

38:24.602 --> 38:25.728
l've made my decision.

38:25.836 --> 38:26.825
What about us?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.097
Don't we have a say?

38:28.205 --> 38:29.331
He's right, Captain.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.873
l'd be willing
to brave this Void

38:30.975 --> 38:32.465
if it meant keeping you with us.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.506
Tom... set a course.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.715
Lieutenant, l gave you an order.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.856
l can't follow that order,
ma'am.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.453
Harry, take the helm.

38:56.934 --> 38:58.799
l'm sorry, Captain.

39:11.248 --> 39:13.216
l will not comply.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.018
What's a hologram to do?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.924
As you can see, you're
not the only one

39:22.993 --> 39:25.621
who's had time
to evaluate the past.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.425
Yes, l can see that.

39:30.968 --> 39:35.769
You realize you could all
be hanged for mutiny.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.138
Looks like we need
another option.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.838
We fire torpedoes the instant
we cross the threshold.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.277
As the vortex
begins to collapse,

39:43.347 --> 39:44.336
we jump into high warp.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.406
There'll be a massive
shock wave on our tail.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.111
l'll reinforce
the aft shielding.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.244
There's still one obstacle--
the Malon.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.312
Antimatter waste has
weakened the bulkhead

39:52.390 --> 39:53.755
surrounding their cargo hold.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.883
A direct phaser strike
should disable them.

39:56.026 --> 39:56.890
Poetic justice.

39:57.027 --> 39:57.891
lndeed.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.393
You realize it will reduce

39:59.463 --> 40:01.021
our chance of getting through.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.089
Chance is irrelevant.
We will succeed.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.896
A vote of Borg confidence.

40:05.035 --> 40:06.798
Who could argue with that?

40:06.904 --> 40:07.893
All right.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.266
Back to your stations.

40:09.373 --> 40:10.397
Let's do it.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.942
Red Alert.
Set a course for the vortex.

40:13.043 --> 40:14.943
All hands to battle stations.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.307
You told them.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.642
They knew coming in.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.546
Let's just say l wouldn't be

40:19.617 --> 40:21.847
a fine First Officer
if l hadn't.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.598
Return fire.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.638
Hit them
with everything we've got.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.339
Their shields are holding.

40:50.414 --> 40:51.403
Open a channel.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.506
This is Voyager.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.051
Stand down your weapons
and fall back.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.449
l'll take that as a ''no.''

40:59.523 --> 41:01.081
The vortex?

41:01.192 --> 41:02.921
Two million kilometers
dead ahead.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.153
Bridge to Engineering.

41:04.228 --> 41:05.718
We're approaching the vortex.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.661
Bring the aft shielding
on line.

41:07.731 --> 41:08.698
Acknowledged.

41:08.766 --> 41:10.427
See you on the other side.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.137
Status?

41:14.238 --> 41:16.172
The port nacelle's
been ruptured.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.434
We're venting plasma.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.738
Can you get us out of here
on one engine, Tom?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.141
l think so.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.679
Torpedoes armed and ready.

41:22.746 --> 41:23.838
On my order, Tuvok.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.779
We'll only get one shot at this.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.647
They're firing spatial charges.

41:27.718 --> 41:28.776
Evade them.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.823
Captain Proton to the rescue.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.431
l'll explain later.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.662
The vortex is in visual range.

41:46.770 --> 41:47.964
Time to intercept?

41:48.105 --> 41:49.003
47 seconds.

41:49.106 --> 41:50.505
Steady as she goes.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.371
Keep laying down fire.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.508
Direct hit! Starboard nacelle!

41:55.579 --> 41:56.876
Both engines are off-line!

41:56.947 --> 41:58.175
We're riding on inertia.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.274
One more hit
and we're dead in the water.

42:00.384 --> 42:02.545
Without warp drive, we'll never
outrun the shock wave.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.178
Tuvok, can you reinforce
the aft shields

42:04.255 --> 42:05.222
with our main deflector?

42:05.289 --> 42:06.221
l believe so.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.484
Do it.

42:07.558 --> 42:10.152
We're going to ride
that shock wave out of here--

42:10.227 --> 42:11.990
let it push us
to the other side.

42:12.062 --> 42:13.188
Adjusting shield harmonics.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.892
Captain.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.732
They intend to block our path.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.237
20 seconds.

42:22.306 --> 42:23.398
Prepare to fire.

42:23.507 --> 42:24.769
That may not be necessary.

42:32.816 --> 42:34.943
The freighter is moving
to combat the aliens.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.950
They're trying to distract
the Malon...

42:37.087 --> 42:38.213
give us the upper hand.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.086
Ten seconds.

42:40.157 --> 42:41.454
The freighter's shields
are weakening.

42:41.525 --> 42:43.550
Target their cargo hold.

42:43.627 --> 42:46.255
Time to take out the garbage.

42:54.371 --> 42:55.736
We're crossing the threshold.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.273
Torpedoes.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.271
Shock wave approaching.
600 meters.

43:05.349 --> 43:06.281
500...

43:06.350 --> 43:07.282
400...

43:07.351 --> 43:08.818
Aft shields at maximum.

43:08.886 --> 43:10.513
All hands brace for impact.

43:17.928 --> 43:20.226
Pressure is building
on the outer hull.

43:20.297 --> 43:21.889
Shields weakening.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.096
We're clear.

43:27.204 --> 43:28.899
The vortex has been destroyed.

43:29.006 --> 43:30.303
Are we out of the Void?

43:30.374 --> 43:31.534
Not yet.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.237
That little maneuver
brought us up a bit short.

43:34.311 --> 43:37.280
We're still 200,000 kilometers
from the boundary.

43:37.348 --> 43:38.610
On screen.

43:43.921 --> 43:45.548
Maintain course.

44:02.039 --> 44:03.802
There.

44:03.874 --> 44:04.966
What?

44:05.075 --> 44:07.339
l saw something.

44:07.411 --> 44:09.208
A star.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.372
Remind me to check
your eyesight.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.243
Harry,
what do you see out there?

44:48.318 --> 44:54.257
l see a densely-packed region
with thousands of star systems.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.718
Looks pretty lively.

45:01.799 --> 45:04.199
Full speed ahead.
