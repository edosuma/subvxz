WEBVTT

00:15.549 --> 00:17.251
Good night, ladies.
Good night.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.819
Get home safe.
Thanks.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.388
Okay. We'll see
you tomorrow.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.423
(keys jingling)

00:25.393 --> 00:27.395
(cell phone ringing)

00:29.630 --> 00:31.732
Hey, kid.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.135
I'll be there in 15.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.204
No, no, you're buying.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.173
You got a big boy job now
and a big boy paycheck.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.808
Uh-huh.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.279
Hey, let me go, son.
I'm locking up.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.650
No, we'll talk
when I get there.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.686
I love you, too.
And, hey, I'm proud of you.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.491
(groans)

01:00.761 --> 01:02.363
(grunts)

01:05.599 --> 01:06.734
(grunts)

01:08.469 --> 01:10.371
MAN: Come on,
hurry up, come on!

01:10.404 --> 01:11.805
Hurry up! Get it!

01:13.407 --> 01:15.075
(gunshot)

01:21.882 --> 01:24.285
(tires screeching)

01:26.187 --> 01:26.854
(camera clicking)

01:26.887 --> 01:29.423
That's it.

01:29.457 --> 01:33.161
Shots went off, I saw the dude
get hit, and I ran.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.862
Got around the block

01:34.895 --> 01:37.831
and I felt this...
burning feeling in my shoulder.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.367
That's all I saw.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.602
That "dude" was an
off-duty police officer,

01:41.635 --> 01:43.771
moonlighting at the
check cashing store.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.573
Did it occur to you,
did it cross your mind

01:45.606 --> 01:47.275
for one second to
go back and help him?!

01:48.309 --> 01:50.878
I mean, I was shot, too.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.247
And you knew you had an active
bench warrant on a drug case,

01:53.281 --> 01:54.482
so you didn't
want to stick around.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.517
You'd rather leave a man die
in the street than go to court.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.887
Hey, please, I can't
go back inside on that warrant.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.189
I got a kid.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.292
I wanted to call, okay?
I really did.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.627
I was scared.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.229
Maybe I wasn't thinking
about the cop, all right?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.600
Good night.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.637
You know what?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.407
There's no law that says
I have to help you guys.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.275
So, you know what'd be nice?
Just a little, maybe,

02:21.309 --> 02:24.545
"Hey, thank you for
cooperating, Mr. Lombardo."

02:24.578 --> 02:26.280
You wouldn't even be
talking to us if the hospital

02:26.314 --> 02:29.617
hadn't called to report you
coming in with a gunshot wound.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.386
Hey, how's that
cop doing, anyway?

02:32.420 --> 02:34.922
He's down the hall,
fighting for his life.

02:34.955 --> 02:35.923
Get up.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.258
What?
Turn around.
Turn around.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.359
Ow. Ow!

02:38.392 --> 02:39.793
Hey, okay. Relax, relax!

02:39.827 --> 02:40.994
What the hell's going on?!

02:41.028 --> 02:43.631
You weren't across the street
running when you got shot.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.699
You were standing
right over the officer

02:45.733 --> 02:47.235
when the bullet went
through your shoulder.

02:47.268 --> 02:51.772
You're no innocent
bystander, you're a liar.

03:12.426 --> 03:16.797
* Out here in the fields

03:16.830 --> 03:20.701
* I fight for my meals

03:20.734 --> 03:25.306
* I get my back into my living

03:27.708 --> 03:29.810
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.555
(man grunting over video)

03:44.392 --> 03:46.360
(typing, computer beeping)

03:49.363 --> 03:50.498
Oh, snap!

03:50.531 --> 03:52.466
I got all y'all! What?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.473
Looks like they all
go to the same barber.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.042
ROSS: Uh-huh, no kidding.
They could be brothers.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.412
What about the rest
of the video?
(sighs)

04:04.445 --> 04:05.879
I see the car,
just not really clear.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.047
Witness took
down the plate.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.816
Car was reported
stolen yesterday.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.919
Okay, I went through the
entire video, open to closing,

04:11.952 --> 04:14.455
and no one resembling
Lombardo came in and out.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.524
If he's involved,
he's not in this video.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.426
All the witnesses
have the same story:

04:18.459 --> 04:20.361
all right, three bald,
African-American males.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
No one puts Lombardo
at the scene.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.664
But the science does.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.499
I examined
those gunshot wounds.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.436
Lombardo was standing
directly over Riley,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.538
facing him,
when Riley shot him.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.939
Bullet travelled
through his shoulder,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.774
ended up on
the other side of the street.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.644
Riley's .38 was recovered
right near his body.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.712
Lombardo was not
shot with that gun

04:38.746 --> 04:39.947
somewhere else later on.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.549
Unless Lombardo
had some sort of

04:41.582 --> 04:45.419
magical cloaking device,
how did he end up

04:45.453 --> 04:48.088
in the crime scene, get shot,
without anybody seeing him?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.458
(sighs)

04:52.092 --> 04:53.193
Mark Riley was the first officer

04:53.226 --> 04:55.763
at one of the first crime scenes
I worked in the city.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.332
He really made
an impression on me.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.569
He was so nice,
very professional...

05:01.602 --> 05:02.570
really knew his stuff.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.606
I bumped into him
at the courthouse a few times.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.408
Always talking
about his family.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.442
Mm.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.081
Looks like he's got someone
following in his footsteps.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.617
Hi, I'm Jason Riley.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.419
Hi. Jo Danville,
detective.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.720
We're from
the crime lab.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.122
Hi, I'm Detective
Lindsay Messer.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.624
Uh, my dad's...
We know.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.858
We're pulling
for him.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.595
Do you have any idea
who did this?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.629
Not yet, but we
have a whole team

05:28.662 --> 05:29.730
of detectives
working on it.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.832
No one's going
home till we do.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.735
So, what? You're, um...
(clears throat)

05:34.768 --> 05:37.871
here to process his body if...

05:37.905 --> 05:39.573
No. No, we're here
to collect evidence

05:39.607 --> 05:41.709
in his clothing once he
pulls through surgery.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.144
I was, I was talking to him

05:44.177 --> 05:45.946
on the phone
just before he got shot.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.515
We both got off at midnight,

05:47.548 --> 05:49.483
and we were gonna
go to the diner,

05:49.517 --> 05:51.885
have coffee
and a midnight snack.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.722
Did he sound worried
or concerned about anything?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.790
No. I mean, he kind of
hurried off the phone

05:56.824 --> 06:00.127
like he was distracted,
but he-he gets that way

06:00.160 --> 06:03.531
when he's trying to do
three things at one time.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.504
He said, um, "I love you
and I'm proud of you," though.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.574
That's pretty good,
right?

06:13.607 --> 06:17.044
If it's the last thing
your father ever says to you?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.579
Don't think like that.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.615
From what I know about
your dad, he's a fighter.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.883
Yeah, he is.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.688
Excuse me.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.593
(talking quietly)

06:32.626 --> 06:34.728
(crying loudly)

06:57.485 --> 06:59.487
(crying continues)

07:06.159 --> 07:08.662
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:08.696 --> 07:10.731
(over TV): last night,
an off-duty NYPD officer

07:10.764 --> 07:13.601
was shot during
a burglary in Queens.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.869
But I'm happy to say that
the officer is out of surgery

07:15.903 --> 07:17.871
and his family is by his side.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.640
(cheering)
Yes!

07:21.609 --> 07:25.178
But I will caution you,
we are not out of the woods yet.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.816
The next 24 to 48 hours
will be crucial in determining

07:28.849 --> 07:30.551
his condition going forward.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.553
I want to thank
my trauma team...

07:32.586 --> 07:34.087
That's good
news for you.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.023
Looks like he's
going to make it.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.535
Well played.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.670
What are you doing?

07:49.703 --> 07:50.971
That press conference
is golden.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.072
It's two years old.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.607
We need an upgrade.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.842
You have a point.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.510
Mac wants us to
wait for him.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.011
So, what do
you think?

07:58.045 --> 07:59.212
Tough nut to crack?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.649
He's scared.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.617
But my gut tells me,
as long as he thinks

08:03.651 --> 08:05.753
Officer Riley is still alive,
he'll keep talking.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.323
(camera clicking)

08:14.194 --> 08:16.196
*

08:46.694 --> 08:49.830
*

09:15.723 --> 09:17.725
*

09:27.901 --> 09:31.772
TAYLOR: I'm gonna make it
real simple for you.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.974
The hole in the front of your
shoulder is an entrance wound.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.709
The hole in the back
is an exit wound.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.945
The bullet entered
at an upward angle

09:37.978 --> 09:39.212
within six feet
of the shooter.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.048
That means you had to
be standing directly

09:41.081 --> 09:43.250
over and facing Officer Riley
when he shot you.

09:43.283 --> 09:47.187
I was across the street,
running away.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.756
Like I told you.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.791
What? That's the truth.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.760
I mean, I could lie
if you want me to.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.695
You know, just tell me
what you want me to say.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.930
I want you to say the names
of the three men you were with.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.965
(scoffs)

09:57.998 --> 09:59.599
Look at me.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.736
The names! Now!

10:02.770 --> 10:04.638
Come on, get up.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.074
Give me an excuse.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.313
(sighs)

10:13.346 --> 10:15.783
I didn't think so.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.055
I'm done with this
piece of garbage.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.157
Do whatever you
want with him.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.103
(door closes)

10:36.136 --> 10:39.740
Damn. I would not want
to get on your bad side.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.848
What, now you gonna
play good cop?

10:47.881 --> 10:50.884
Be honest with you,
I don't know what to do.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.820
He's usually the good cop.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.825
He's also the boss.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.993
And the last guy

11:00.027 --> 11:02.062
in this building you
want to piss off.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.764
Look, man,
you got a witness

11:03.797 --> 11:07.034
who can I.D. me,
bring him in.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.470
You got any of that DNA crap,
bring it on.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.906
Otherwise, take me to court
on that warrant,

11:12.940 --> 11:15.275
because I told you what I saw.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.810
(sniffs)

11:39.767 --> 11:41.835
Look...

11:41.869 --> 11:44.404
you seem like a smart guy.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.008
So you know if we had a witness,
you'd be standing in a lineup.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.843
I'm not gonna lie.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.980
All I got you on is
that warrant right now.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.484
So what makes you so sure
that I'm lying?

11:57.517 --> 12:01.321
Because your story
makes no sense.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.991
It couldn't have happened
the way you said.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.827
He's being too soft.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.061
Mm.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.763
He's being patient.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.767
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather have in that room.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.136
You got hit with a bullet from
Officer Riley's five-shot .38.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.771
That thing's
a pea-shooter.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.240
It wouldn't barely break
the skin from across the street.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.310
It definitely would not go
clean through you shoulder

12:23.343 --> 12:24.945
from that distance.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.847
Impossible.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.251
I've been doing this
for a long time.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.954
I've heard a
lot of stories.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.989
This one's bad.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.195
Anthony, listen to me.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.932
Being six feet away
from a cop getting robbed

12:44.965 --> 12:47.034
does not make you
guilty of anything.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.402
It just means that maybe
you got a little too close

12:49.436 --> 12:51.972
to a bad situation.

12:52.005 --> 12:56.043
All of our witnesses say that
three bald black guys did this.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.947
You got a full head of hair,
and you look pretty white to me.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.049
What are you hiding?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.188
Maybe you think no
one will believe you

13:08.221 --> 13:10.323
because of your record?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.592
If that's it,
you got to tell me,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.295
because the people out there are
looking to put this on someone,

13:15.328 --> 13:17.097
and right now, that
someone is you.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.908
(groans):
Oh, man.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.848
All right.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.884
(scoffs)

13:39.086 --> 13:41.054
I wasn't
across the street, okay?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.556
I was passing by
on the same side

13:43.590 --> 13:45.258
that they shot that cop on.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.061
I didn't know what was up
till the shots went off.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.162
I got hit.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.998
I just ran.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.100
I mean, that's it.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.103
I had nothing to do
with that cop getting shot.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.571
What the hell is wrong with you?

13:58.605 --> 13:59.940
What?

13:59.973 --> 14:02.876
Why did we have to
waste all of that time

14:02.910 --> 14:04.344
to get to the truth?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.446
(sighs)

14:06.479 --> 14:07.514
I don't know.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.182
I'm coming back with
a pen and a pad.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.583
I want you to write
down your statement.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.119
Yeah, hey,
but I'm no good with spelling.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.087
Neither am I.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.089
Fish on, the
hook is in,

14:16.123 --> 14:17.958
and we reeled him
into the crime scene.

14:17.991 --> 14:21.028
I'm not buying he was scared
because of the warrant.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.630
He's involved.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.099
Nice work.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.436
I nearly messed myself when
you spun his chair around.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.109
I know that look.
What are you thinking?

14:36.143 --> 14:38.078
He puts himself at
the crime scene,

14:38.111 --> 14:40.513
but we don't evidence
that proves he was involved

14:40.547 --> 14:42.015
in the robbery.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.483
He's not
on the surveillance tape,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.618
and we don't have a
witness who can place him

14:45.652 --> 14:47.154
with other three perps.

14:49.022 --> 14:52.192
Something's not right.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.671
*

15:13.746 --> 15:15.615
(shutter clicks)

15:35.568 --> 15:37.637
*

16:02.429 --> 16:04.231
(beeping)

16:10.703 --> 16:14.041
Lunch at Lawson's says
my results come up first.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.176
Dinner, Grimaldi's.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.511
You're on.
Yeah, all right.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.613
All the blood samples I got
from Officer Riley's clothing

16:20.647 --> 16:22.415
came back to him;
no foreign DNA.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.617
And I did find two hairs
on his shirt.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.186
They were both synthetic.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.256
Some kind
of polyester-acrylic blend.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.391
They also had epoxy
on the ends.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
Two guys did have facial hair.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.395
Could be from a fake beard
or mustache.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.230
(beeping)

16:38.731 --> 16:40.700
(snaps fingers)

16:40.733 --> 16:42.369
We're going to Grimaldi's.
(groans)

16:44.304 --> 16:46.106
Wait, hold up,
latex and silicone

16:46.139 --> 16:47.740
under Riley's fingernails

16:47.774 --> 16:49.109
and also on
the bullet

16:49.142 --> 16:52.112
that went through
Lombardo's shoulder.

16:52.145 --> 16:55.048
And synthetic hairs.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.583
Think I know
what we're looking for.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.151
(dialing)

17:02.722 --> 17:04.656
Spelling's pretty bad, right?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.159
FLACK:
It's terrible.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.428
There no such word as "runned."
It's "ran."

17:08.461 --> 17:10.762
But the important thing is
that the story makes sense

17:10.797 --> 17:12.464
and I believe it.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.169
I just got to run it up the
flagpole, check with the bosses.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.209
We executed a search
warrant at your apartment,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.477
found some
interesting stuff.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.346
Look familiar?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.151
How about this?

17:32.885 --> 17:36.723
That's you, wearing this mask.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.859
You didn't witness

17:39.892 --> 17:41.861
three guys committing a robbery.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.730
You were one of them.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.334
(sighs)

17:55.175 --> 17:56.609
FLACK:
Four.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.678
They say it's a great age.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.580
Gonna be honest with you.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.615
I don't remember it.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.755
She'll be going to kindergarten
next year, won't she?

18:08.788 --> 18:12.625
That first day of school
is always a big one.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.662
Let's figure this out.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.697
Attempted murder
of a police officer,

18:17.730 --> 18:20.667
that's, like,
ten years minimum.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.269
Robbery one,

18:22.302 --> 18:23.803
possession of a loaded firearm,

18:23.836 --> 18:26.539
criminal possession
of stolen property,

18:26.573 --> 18:30.777
all the other little charges,
add another seven or eight.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.113
My guess,
you're looking at 15 minimum.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.883
(snaps fingers)

18:36.916 --> 18:38.551
Damn, you'll probably
just miss the prom

18:38.585 --> 18:40.420
and high school graduation.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.354
But no big deal.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.356
She probably won't even
know you by then.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.893
And your girl will promise,
and she might even mean it,

18:46.926 --> 18:48.695
but I'm telling you this
right now,

18:48.728 --> 18:50.663
there is no way
she's gonna schlep up

18:50.697 --> 18:52.299
to some maxi max prison

18:52.332 --> 18:54.167
on the US-Canadian border
to come and see you.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.735
Not gonna happen.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.670
You getting your rocks off?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.672
Messing with my heart.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.774
Disrespecting my family.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.910
No more than you've been
getting your rocks off

19:03.943 --> 19:05.712
disrespecting me,
sitting in that chair,

19:05.745 --> 19:08.748
lying to my face
for the last couple hours!

19:08.781 --> 19:12.419
You made me look like a jackass
in front of my bosses,

19:12.452 --> 19:14.587
and I was trying
to help you out!

19:14.621 --> 19:16.256
I believed you, man.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.890
I really did!

19:17.924 --> 19:20.293
I'm sorry about that.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.698
Is there people
watching us?

19:25.732 --> 19:26.866
Well, there was.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.568
There was a whole crowd
of people.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.736
It was standing room only.

19:29.769 --> 19:30.937
But there's nothing
to watch anymore.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.739
It's a ghost town
in there now.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.209
Everyone's out in front
of the precinct right now

19:36.243 --> 19:38.878
at a press conference
announcing your arrest.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.613
The case is cleared.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.614
They got their man.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.882
Yeah, they'll say
something brave

19:42.915 --> 19:44.517
about going after
the other two guys,

19:44.551 --> 19:46.419
but at the end of he day,
the cop didn't die.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.489
They are happy putting
all of this on you.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.891
And you might be good with that,
but I'm not.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.926
I want the truth.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.566
Anthony,

19:59.599 --> 20:01.568
I'm pretty sure
you didn't pull the trigger

20:01.601 --> 20:03.636
and shoot that cop.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.694
I got to give it to you.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.563
You're a stand-up guy.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.700
I don't think
I could do it.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.936
Those guys drove off
and left you in the street,

20:36.969 --> 20:39.372
knowing you were shot.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.574
That's messed up.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.016
Who are they?

20:51.651 --> 20:53.653
What are their names?

21:01.394 --> 21:03.262
All right.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.037
You think of those names,
you give me a shout.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.972
I'll be around for a bit.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.441
(groans softly)

21:14.474 --> 21:16.743
If not, I'll see
you in court.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.679
He's protecting someone.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.981
Someone he's afraid of
or someone he cares about.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.688
He never took
his sergeant's test.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.323
Had no interest
in being a boss.

21:30.357 --> 21:33.826
He worked that second job
to make up for the money.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.629
I never thought
that's how he'd die.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.867
Jason...

21:40.900 --> 21:43.536
is there any way
I can talk you out of this?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.372
No.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.806
My father

21:46.839 --> 21:49.642
was invincible in my eyes.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.711
I need to know
how it went down

21:51.744 --> 21:53.613
and how he died.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.830
The first round entered
your father's abdomen,

22:10.863 --> 22:11.898
perforating the bowel

22:11.931 --> 22:14.567
and coming to rest
near the spine.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.438
It was nonfatal.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.874
The next round
entered here,

22:21.908 --> 22:23.810
struck a rib,

22:23.843 --> 22:25.712
shattering it.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.480
There was significant damage
to the right lung,

22:27.514 --> 22:30.650
but again,
it was nonfatal.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.819
These first two rounds
were fired from a distance

22:32.852 --> 22:34.086
of three to six feet.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.725
This one was close contact.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.728
The gun was pressed
against his face.

22:43.796 --> 22:44.564
(gunshot)

22:44.597 --> 22:46.766
So he was...

22:46.799 --> 22:48.935
he was executed.

22:48.968 --> 22:49.636
Um...

22:49.669 --> 22:52.472
Lying helpless on the ground?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.724
(sniffles)

23:13.660 --> 23:15.828
What kind of human being
does that?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.145
TAYLOR: You all have
your assignments.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.548
I want every family
member, every friend,

23:35.582 --> 23:37.750
every past associate,
every codefendant

23:37.784 --> 23:39.452
of Anthony Lombardo
spoken to.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.887
If they aren't home,
track them down.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.922
If they have a warrant,
drag them in.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.090
If they don't, coax them in.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.959
Somebody on that list was
running with Lombardo last night

23:46.993 --> 23:47.794
or knows who was.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.896
You all have the year,
make, model

23:49.929 --> 23:51.831
of the stolen car
used in the robbery.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.032
Keep your eyes open.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.233
It's probably dumped
somewhere nearby.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.903
TAYLOR: I know some of you
have worked through the night.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.873
If you start feeling tired,
think of Mark Riley's family.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.809
Now get out there. Be safe.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.915
DANVILLE: Lombardo's always
been a property thief--

24:08.948 --> 24:10.717
burglary, grand larceny,

24:10.750 --> 24:11.651
drugs.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.020
Seems so out of character
to shoot a cop.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.988
LOVATO: They came at Riley
with pepper spray.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.558
And the only guns we know of
belonged to him.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.527
Maybe shooting a cop
wasn't part of the plan.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.696
Half these cases are
always inside jobs.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.897
Lindsay's working with
the owner of Bright-Star,

24:24.931 --> 24:27.867
putting a list together of
current and former employees.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.202
So, a sector from the Bronx
just called the desk downstairs.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.270
They found the car.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.906
Dumped under
the Deegan Expressway.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.486
*

25:16.816 --> 25:17.950
Hey, get up.

25:19.318 --> 25:20.587
What's going on?

25:20.620 --> 25:22.121
Officer Riley passed away.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.023
(sighs):
Oh, God.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.592
TAYLOR: We have
the car, Anthony.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.994
Your friends' prints
were all over it.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.729
It's just a matter of time

25:29.762 --> 25:32.031
before your pals are sitting
in the room next door

25:32.064 --> 25:33.666
in the same situation
that you are.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.034
FLACK:
What do you think?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.669
They gonna be stand-up like you?

25:36.703 --> 25:38.304
(sighs)

25:38.337 --> 25:40.607
You're here. We're here.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.109
You want to make a deal,
now's the time to do it.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.076
When they come
through that door,

25:44.110 --> 25:46.779
all bets are off.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.850
Don't do it for us.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.119
Do it for her.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.658
What's it gonna be, Anthony?

26:02.194 --> 26:04.697
(sighs)

26:04.731 --> 26:06.265
I got nothing to tell you.

26:11.037 --> 26:14.006
You're making
a very bad decision.

26:14.040 --> 26:18.010
And I'm gonna do my best
to make sure that you regret it

26:18.044 --> 26:20.179
for the rest of your life.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.685
I'm gonna brief
the mayor and the D.A.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.754
I'll be back in an hour.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.794
You still don't get it.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.329
No, you don't get it.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.165
I snitch, I'm dead.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.201
My girl is dead,
my daughter is dead.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.770
Do you understand that?

26:46.072 --> 26:48.140
We can protect your family.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.042
(scoffs)

26:52.178 --> 26:54.180
No, you can't.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.184
(door opens)

26:58.217 --> 26:59.986
You were right.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.153
He is afraid of someone.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.388
Yeah.

27:02.421 --> 27:07.126
So afraid, he's willing to take
the fall for killing a cop.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.169
Here you go.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.341
(sighs) I'll get
you over to booking

27:22.374 --> 27:24.076
when you're
done eating.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.212
Unless you've had
a change of heart.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.214
I didn't.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.149
And I won't.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.699
Who's that?
What's going on?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.935
The guy in the suit,
he's the D.A.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.138
You know who
the other guy is.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.173
Roland Benitez.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.276
You probably call him Mookie.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.083
We got his prints on the car;
he wants to make a deal.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.785
(scoffs)

28:05.818 --> 28:07.253
No way.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.188
No way. Mookie's no snitch.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.790
You don't think so?

28:10.823 --> 28:13.059
'Cause they didn't bring
the D.A. and the camera in

28:13.092 --> 28:14.126
to make a YouTube video.

28:16.863 --> 28:20.466
He might be in the room
with all that...

28:20.499 --> 28:23.069
no, no way he's rolling on me.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.171
(knock on door)

28:29.041 --> 28:30.977
(whispering)

28:46.125 --> 28:47.827
(sighs)

28:47.860 --> 28:50.329
Mookie's definitely
a better speller.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.899
What is that?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.300
They make you write
a confession

28:54.333 --> 28:56.168
before you do a video.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.207
Looks like he's putting the gun
in your hands.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.975
Let me see that.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.343
That would be unprofessional.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.213
(chuckles)

29:07.246 --> 29:09.415
That ain't real, man.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.051
What, you think I'm stupid?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.920
I know
what you're doing.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.923
Yeah, you're trying to fool me.

29:16.956 --> 29:20.126
You give me too much credit,
Anthony.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.895
You said you're gonna
take me to court.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.196
What are you waiting for?

29:24.230 --> 29:25.464
Do you really think

29:25.497 --> 29:27.967
that I'm playing
some kind of trick on you?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.438
Yeah, I do.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.374
You ever heard the expression
"seeing is believing"?

29:35.407 --> 29:38.577
What if I let you see Mookie
talking to the D.A.?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.412
Would you believe me then?

29:43.916 --> 29:46.886
(sighs)

29:46.919 --> 29:50.022
D.A.: You can't tell me the
truths you want to tell me.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.191
You can't just tell me
what I want to hear.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.126
In order for us
to make this deal,

29:54.160 --> 29:55.261
you have to tell me
everything.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.896
Don, he can't be in here.

29:56.929 --> 29:57.763
Two seconds.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.531
I want him to see
this for himself.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.134
MOOKIE:
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.070
D.A.:
Let's start with the car.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.204
Were you worried about alarms?

30:05.237 --> 30:09.308
By the time you hear the alarm
and you get to the window

30:09.341 --> 30:11.277
in your boxer shorts,
I'm halfway down the block...

30:11.310 --> 30:12.945
Where is he?
Relax.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.446
TAYLOR: He's about
to put the final nail

30:14.480 --> 30:16.482
in your coffin, my
friend. You're done.

30:16.515 --> 30:20.019
D.A.: Okay, I'm gonna be
very specific.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.921
I want to talk about the car
you stole yesterday.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.156
I want the names of the people
who were with you.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.391
Where is he?
I want to talk to him right now!

30:25.424 --> 30:26.525
Calm down.
No, I want to talk to him!

30:26.558 --> 30:28.127
I didn't shoot
that cop!
Hey!

30:28.160 --> 30:30.897
I didn't shoot
that cop!

30:30.930 --> 30:33.032
Calm down!
I'm not going
down for this.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.901
I want to talk
to the D.A.!

30:34.934 --> 30:35.902
Right now, man!

30:35.935 --> 30:37.336
I want to make
a deal, okay?

30:37.369 --> 30:39.071
I want to
make a deal.
Okay.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.207
You'll have a chance
to tell your story. Let's go.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.641
I am not going down

30:42.674 --> 30:44.043
for this, man!

30:44.076 --> 30:45.177
I didn't do this!

30:45.211 --> 30:47.313
He's lying to you!

30:47.346 --> 30:48.447
I didn't do this!

30:48.480 --> 30:50.249
Nice job everybody.
We got him.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.418
Now we need to
find the third guy

30:52.451 --> 30:54.954
and determine
who actually pulled the trigger.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.522
Looks like I missed all the fun.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.323
LOVATO:
You did.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.191
I think we just
flipped Lombardo.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.292
I've got more
good news.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.460
Guess whose name
showed up

31:01.493 --> 31:03.195
on a list of former
Bright-Star employees.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.396
Lombardo.
Yep.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.398
He worked there as a messenger
for three months

31:06.432 --> 31:08.300
during the same time
that Mark Riley was there.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.401
They knew each other.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.903
They fired Anthony
six months ago

31:10.937 --> 31:12.138
when he stopped
showing up for work.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.040
He's our inside man.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.679
We been homeboys
since we were 12, man.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.416
I can't believe that bitch
turned on me like that.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.419
Anthony, when you're in here,

31:27.453 --> 31:29.355
it's every man for himself.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.490
So, right now,

31:31.523 --> 31:34.660
it's about saving yourself.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.977
TAYLOR:
You knew Mark Riley.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.112
You worked with him
at Bright-Star.

31:53.145 --> 31:56.482
Look, him getting shot...

31:58.617 --> 32:01.620
...that was
never supposed to happen.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.025
I believe you.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.227
But no more lies, Anthony.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.695
You tell me the
truth here and now,

32:09.728 --> 32:12.064
I'll do everything
I can to help you.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.067
But you lie to me just
once about anything,

32:15.101 --> 32:17.236
I'll make sure you never live
to see the outside

32:17.269 --> 32:18.404
of a prison ever again.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.439
You understand?

32:22.608 --> 32:24.576
(sniffs)

32:24.610 --> 32:27.279
Me and Roland...

32:27.313 --> 32:30.416
we owed Eric money for this
stash of weed we had to ditch

32:30.449 --> 32:32.618
when the cops came at us
a few weeks ago.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.387
It was a lot.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.456
Like, ten grand worth.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.091
What's Eric's last name?

32:39.125 --> 32:40.226
Mookie didn't know.

32:40.259 --> 32:43.429
He knows.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.698
He didn't tell you
'cause he was scared.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.700
Eric, man...

32:48.734 --> 32:52.271
he's a stone-cold killer.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.440
He's got bodies on him.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.442
You got to promise me

32:56.475 --> 32:58.477
that you're gonna
protect my family.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.015
You have my word.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.186
(sighs)

33:10.556 --> 33:12.558
(quietly):
Oh, man.

33:17.063 --> 33:20.232
Blaylock.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.467
Eric Blaylock.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.239
Eric, Eric, Eric.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.178
Eric Blaylock.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.213
Got him.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.582
(door opens, closes)

33:40.486 --> 33:44.590
So you decide to rob Bright-Star
as a way of paying Eric back.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.093
(sniffs)
I told him

33:47.126 --> 33:48.760
that me and Roland
could do the job.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.729
He says he's got to come with

33:50.762 --> 33:52.764
to make sure I don't skim
any money from the top

33:52.798 --> 33:55.134
before he gets paid
what he's owed.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.736
But Eric's crazy.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.539
I told him I wasn't gonna do it

34:00.572 --> 34:02.308
unless there was no guns.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.610
That's pretty ballsy.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.512
Robbing a cop with no gun.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.580
Nah, I knew the routine
from working there.

34:08.614 --> 34:12.618
I knew Mark carried a gun
on his right side in his pants.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.621
I knew that if we came at him
with pepper spray, masks,

34:15.654 --> 34:20.058
we could beat him down,
get the gun and the cash.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.163
(groans)

34:24.196 --> 34:26.498
(grunting)

34:26.532 --> 34:29.135
We did it.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.371
It worked, man. We had it.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.643
I didn't know...

34:37.676 --> 34:39.678
that he had another gun.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.848
(gunshot)

34:47.418 --> 34:48.620
(two gunshots)

34:50.156 --> 34:51.657
(gunshot)

34:51.690 --> 34:53.592
Get in!

34:56.295 --> 34:57.796
(chuckles softly)

35:02.201 --> 35:03.802
(sirens wailing)

35:03.835 --> 35:06.805
LINDSAY:
Blaylock! NYPD, stop!

35:09.175 --> 35:10.676
(gun clicking empty)

35:11.743 --> 35:13.679
DANNY:
Stop right there!

35:13.712 --> 35:15.247
Hands up!

35:15.281 --> 35:16.315
Put your hands
in the air!

35:16.348 --> 35:17.649
You want to live,
put your hands

35:17.683 --> 35:19.351
in the air, get
on your knees!

35:19.385 --> 35:20.652
On your knees!

35:20.686 --> 35:22.621
(tires screeching)

35:22.654 --> 35:24.290
See these cuffs?

35:25.691 --> 35:27.626
They belong
to the man you murdered.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.571
Go ahead.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.673
Take a peek.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.742
I'm sure you recognize
these guys.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.212
I've never seen them before
in my life.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.546
FLACK:
Come on.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.847
You know this guy?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.482
Nope.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.487
How 'bout him?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.523
You know him?

36:04.630 --> 36:06.732
Yeah, I know him.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.535
I know him real good.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.740
And no matter what you say,

36:14.773 --> 36:17.909
what you do to him,
what you promise him,

36:17.943 --> 36:20.779
he ain't writing nothing,
and he ain't saying nothing.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.848
Matter of fact,

36:22.881 --> 36:25.417
I think he wants a lawyer.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.754
(sighs)

36:33.024 --> 36:35.727
Smug son of a bitch.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.396
He's lucky
he didn't catch a bullet.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.231
All right,
at least we have him

36:39.265 --> 36:40.666
for two counts
of attempted murder

36:40.699 --> 36:42.734
on Lindsay and Lovato,
so he's not going anywhere.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.803
The gun we recovered in the
alley wasn't Mark Riley's.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.672
We're working on a search
warrant for Eric's place.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.307
Don't expect it
to turn up there.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.775
And the car was wiped clean.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.711
He did a good job of covering
his tracks up on that.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.614
So, as it stands right now,
we have no forensic evidence

36:55.647 --> 36:57.783
that links him
to Mark Riley's murder.

36:57.816 --> 36:58.850
We need a confession.

36:58.884 --> 36:59.985
That's not likely.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.953
He just lawyered up.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.761
Well...

37:09.795 --> 37:13.632
that just means
we can't talk to him.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.635
But maybe somebody else can.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.917
(cell door slides open)

37:59.545 --> 38:02.280
*

38:14.860 --> 38:16.995
I didn't give you up.

38:17.028 --> 38:19.998
I swear to God, man.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.701
I swear to God,
Mookie flipped on us.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.370
Man, he gave up the whole thing.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.704
You stupid bastard.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.738
Listen to me.

38:26.772 --> 38:27.773
Listen to me.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.640
Dude wrote a confession.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.842
I saw it;
he flipped on both of us.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.678
Shut up!

38:32.711 --> 38:33.812
Eric...

38:33.845 --> 38:37.349
Mookie didn't
give anything up.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.921
Mookie's dead.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.725
No, man, he isn't.
He can't be. I saw him.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.993
And I saw him, too.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.696
I saw that cop
shoot him in the leg

38:50.729 --> 38:52.030
while he was
running away.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.732
(gunshot)

38:53.765 --> 38:54.866
(groans)

38:54.900 --> 38:57.736
ERIC:
He bled out in the front seat

38:57.769 --> 38:59.605
of the car right
in front of me.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.373
I watched him die.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.676
Then I shoved him in the trunk
of the car.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.785
No, that's not possible.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.721
I'm telling you, man,
I saw it with my own eyes.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.923
He was making the video, man.
He was talking to the D.A.!

39:17.956 --> 39:19.791
There is no video!

39:19.825 --> 39:21.493
He didn't confess!

39:37.509 --> 39:40.579
They played you,
Anthony.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.815
Those cops played you.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.722
D.A.: Were you worried
about alarms, Mr. Benitez?

39:50.756 --> 39:51.823
Alarms?

39:51.857 --> 39:53.124
By the time

39:53.158 --> 39:54.960
you hear the alarm,
I'm halfway down the block

39:54.993 --> 39:56.828
listening to
your satellite radio.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.430
(computer beeping)

40:06.572 --> 40:08.607
*

40:33.231 --> 40:35.634
Alarms?

40:35.667 --> 40:38.970
By the time you hear the alarm,
I'm halfway down the block

40:39.004 --> 40:40.038
listening to
your satellite radio.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.874
Did you tell them
I shot the cop?

40:47.646 --> 40:48.847
Did you?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.882
They already knew, man.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.017
I swear it, Mookie told them.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.019
There is no Mookie!

40:55.020 --> 40:57.656
(yelling)

41:04.930 --> 41:06.798
I'm gonna kill you.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.634
Come on, man.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.570
The first chance I get,
I'm gonna kill you!

41:13.038 --> 41:16.107
You got played,
you stupid bitch!

41:16.141 --> 41:17.876
You got played.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.911
(yelling)

41:44.035 --> 41:45.837
Done. Done!
(laughs)

41:45.871 --> 41:46.972
In the boat.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.908
Filleted, pan-fried,
on the plate.

41:49.941 --> 41:50.942
Oh, that was perfect.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.744
Anthony's statement
plus Blaylock's

41:52.778 --> 41:54.045
corroborating statement
gives us

41:54.079 --> 41:56.247
a rock-solid felony murder case
against both guys.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.216
Yeah, thank God
for civilized lies.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.019
It's moments like
these remind me

42:01.052 --> 42:02.253
how much I love
this job.
(sighs)

42:02.287 --> 42:05.624
I'm only gonna
say this once.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.058
Did an amazing job
in that room.

42:07.092 --> 42:07.793
Thank you.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.194
Yeah, our work
is done here.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.929
Let's wrap it
up and go home.

42:19.605 --> 42:21.607
(kids giggling)

42:26.612 --> 42:28.614
(people chattering)

42:35.153 --> 42:36.287
Detective Messer,

42:36.321 --> 42:37.889
thank you for coming.
Oh, not at all.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.024
This is my
husband, Danny.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.058
Hey. How you doing?

42:40.091 --> 42:41.727
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.728
You should know, every cop

42:42.761 --> 42:44.996
that worked in Manhattan
for the past 20 years--

42:45.030 --> 42:46.097
they knew your father.

42:46.131 --> 42:49.067
He was something special.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.001
Thank you, guys.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.070
Uh, can you, you know,
come in for a second?

42:52.103 --> 42:54.139
Have a bite to eat?
Oh, no. Thank you.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.907
We just wanted
to pay our respects.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.143
And, uh, I wanted
to give you something.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.179
I made a few
phone calls.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.115
It's yours.

43:04.149 --> 43:07.185
Course, you don't get to
wear it till you graduate

43:07.218 --> 43:09.154
from the
academy, but...

43:09.187 --> 43:10.221
every time you pin it
on your uniform,

43:10.255 --> 43:12.023
you can think of your dad
and what he represented.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.826
I'd say make him proud,

43:14.860 --> 43:17.195
but... he already was.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.032
Thank you for everything.

43:23.669 --> 43:25.103
Excuse me.

43:28.173 --> 43:31.109
(quietly):
They, uh, gave me Dad's badge.
