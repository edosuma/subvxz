WEBVTT

00:39.445 --> 00:41.412
I really like him.

00:41.447 --> 00:43.348
I just...

00:43.383 --> 00:46.483
I don't know,
sometimes he just...

00:46.518 --> 00:50.355
he just makes these jokes
that are kind of...

00:50.390 --> 00:52.159
cutting.

00:52.194 --> 00:53.853
Like...

00:53.888 --> 00:56.163
kind of like he's
making fun of me.

00:57.628 --> 01:00.695
He makes jokes at your expense.

01:00.730 --> 01:04.171
Um... well, I think
he's just trying to be funny.

01:04.206 --> 01:07.207
But, um, yeah, I don't know
if I'm supposed to...

01:07.242 --> 01:10.243
joke back or just...

01:10.278 --> 01:12.608
Have you asked him
to stop?

01:12.643 --> 01:14.544
Yeah. Sort of.

01:14.579 --> 01:17.547
And what did he say?

01:17.582 --> 01:19.219
Um...

01:19.254 --> 01:24.191
well, he said that I was
being overly sensitive

01:24.226 --> 01:26.358
and that they're just jokes.

01:26.393 --> 01:29.262
So he continues even
though he knows it hurts you.

01:32.432 --> 01:35.268
Well, nobody else
seems to mind, I guess.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.831
But if he cares
about you, he would stop.

01:37.866 --> 01:40.570
You should tell him to stop.

01:40.605 --> 01:43.705
I think he'd just say that...

01:43.740 --> 01:45.839
it's my problem
and I should just get over it.

01:45.874 --> 01:47.511
Well, then tell him
to fuck off.

01:47.546 --> 01:49.777
This guy's a sadist,
he likes to cut people down.

01:49.812 --> 01:52.186
You can tell him that.

01:52.221 --> 01:55.420
He'd just say
I'm not getting the joke.

01:55.455 --> 01:57.917
A sadist never understands
why others

01:57.952 --> 02:00.656
aren't enjoying his sadism
as much as he is.

02:04.332 --> 02:08.466
You should find someone
who makes you feel good.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.435
Can you do that?

02:10.470 --> 02:11.733
Yeah.

02:12.835 --> 02:14.571
Okay, yeah.

02:16.377 --> 02:17.508
Okay.

02:17.543 --> 02:18.707
See you tomorrow.

02:18.742 --> 02:21.743
-Um, Margaret.
-Hmm?

02:21.778 --> 02:24.944
Can you just promise not to...

02:24.979 --> 02:28.288
to say anything about this
to anyone?

02:28.323 --> 02:30.851
Of course not.

02:30.886 --> 02:32.292
Fort Knox.

02:40.533 --> 02:42.434
-Good night.
-Good night.

03:00.982 --> 03:02.751
-Good night.
-Good night.

04:42.886 --> 04:45.491
Abbie is out for the night.

04:53.930 --> 04:55.699
How's the wife?

04:56.999 --> 04:58.097
Fair.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.539
I'm gonna go with "fair."

05:00.574 --> 05:02.640
Mm-hmm. Could be worse.

05:04.776 --> 05:06.776
Yeah, that's our motto.

05:06.811 --> 05:09.581
We had that inscribed
in our wedding bands.

05:09.616 --> 05:11.110
Hmm.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.848
Peter.

05:12.883 --> 05:14.014
Mm-hmm.

05:14.049 --> 05:16.115
Do you ever draw?

05:18.658 --> 05:20.658
-Do I draw?
-Yeah.

05:20.693 --> 05:23.793
You know, drawing.

05:26.963 --> 05:28.699
I mean, yeah.

05:28.734 --> 05:32.065
Uh... Chloe likes me
to draw with her sometimes.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.001
Yeah?

05:34.036 --> 05:38.071
The other day, she made me
draw Peppa Pig, 47 times.

05:39.646 --> 05:42.812
Yeah. I...

05:42.847 --> 05:45.947
I made a drawing the other day.

05:45.982 --> 05:47.982
A nude? Of me? A nude of me?

05:48.017 --> 05:49.621
No, it was abstract,

05:49.656 --> 05:51.051
a geometric thing.

05:52.593 --> 05:53.724
Can I see it?

05:55.629 --> 05:56.793
No.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.062
I hadn't drawn anything

06:02.097 --> 06:03.569
in 22 years.

06:05.672 --> 06:07.441
I used to do it all the time.

06:07.476 --> 06:09.905
Constantly, hours and hours.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.809
Forget to eat,

06:12.844 --> 06:14.679
forget where I was.

06:18.619 --> 06:19.948
Never told me that.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.654
Well, it's not really

06:22.689 --> 06:23.886
very important.

06:23.921 --> 06:25.855
So, what do you think,
further sex,

06:25.890 --> 06:27.626
or you got to get home?

06:46.581 --> 06:48.515
Hey, wakey, wakey.

06:48.550 --> 06:50.451
-Time to get up.

06:51.982 --> 06:54.081
If you get up,
I'll make you breakfast.

06:54.116 --> 06:55.621
Hell no.

06:55.656 --> 06:57.887
Oh, thank you.

06:57.922 --> 06:59.658
Steamroller?

06:59.693 --> 07:00.824
No.

07:02.058 --> 07:03.530
Hmm.

07:03.565 --> 07:06.929
No! Mom, please stop!

07:06.964 --> 07:09.129
Mom!

07:23.145 --> 07:24.584
Good morning.

07:25.785 --> 07:27.752
Through cell membrane
reorganization,

07:27.787 --> 07:31.217
1037 can play
a significant part

07:31.252 --> 07:34.594
in inhibiting metastasis
and tumor cell proliferation,

07:34.629 --> 07:39.027
so, in short, it's potentially
pretty fucking great.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.734
Interns, you guys
didn't hear that.

08:00.787 --> 08:02.523
Hi, smidgen.

08:15.967 --> 08:18.132
Seriously, Abbie?

08:23.810 --> 08:25.073
Are you hungry?

08:25.108 --> 08:26.206
I was gonna cook.

08:26.241 --> 08:27.944
No need.

08:27.979 --> 08:30.914
Well, you should eat something.

08:30.949 --> 08:32.751
Are you having cereal?

08:32.786 --> 08:33.884
Maybe.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.589
Yeah, well, it's not a meal.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.888
It's fine, I'm going to Lucy's
in a little bit anyway.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.593
You are?

08:39.628 --> 08:41.793
Were you planning on telling me
that you're going out?

08:41.828 --> 08:44.059
I'm telling you now.

08:44.094 --> 08:46.996
Yeah, but it would have been
nice to know in advance.

08:47.031 --> 08:49.603
You know,
just a one-sentence text.

08:49.638 --> 08:51.297
Is that too much of an ask?

08:53.169 --> 08:57.875
I'll take it into serious
consideration for next time.

08:57.910 --> 09:00.647
-Come on, let me
make you something.
-Mom! It's fine!

09:00.682 --> 09:02.880
I'll just get something
with Lucy.

09:03.982 --> 09:05.784
They always have...

09:05.819 --> 09:08.688
snack bars at these orgies,
anyway.

09:13.992 --> 09:15.662
Wanna see something?

09:15.697 --> 09:17.829
Um... I don't know.

09:17.864 --> 09:19.028
Do I?

09:28.303 --> 09:29.907
What the...? Oh, my God.

09:29.942 --> 09:31.139
Abbie, is that your tooth?

09:32.846 --> 09:34.978
No, it is, in fact,
not my tooth.

09:35.013 --> 09:36.683
What on Earth is it?

09:36.718 --> 09:38.245
I don't know,
I found it in my wallet.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.148
You found it--
What are you talking about?

09:40.183 --> 09:43.118
Seriously, just like appeared
in the change pouch today.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.252
Look, it's got like...

09:45.287 --> 09:46.924
tartar on it and shit.

09:46.959 --> 09:49.025
Well, where the hell
did it come from?

09:54.934 --> 09:56.131
Smidge.

09:59.202 --> 10:03.105
Promise me that you'll be
careful on your own at school.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.844
Gonna be reckless, ma.

10:05.879 --> 10:08.748
Some frat guy hands me a pill,
I'm just gonna take it.

10:08.783 --> 10:09.980
No questions asked.

10:10.015 --> 10:11.883
That's not funny.

10:11.918 --> 10:13.918
Sorry it's not funny.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.812
<i>Now, let's get busy.</i>
<i>Come on, Jean-Louis.</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:41.814
<i>-Come along. Oh, that's fine.</i>

10:41.849 --> 10:44.080
<i>-Who gets your vote?</i>
-<i> Scobie.</i>

10:44.115 --> 10:46.346
<i>-He's the one who objected.</i>
-Hello.

10:46.381 --> 10:48.249
<i> I'll take Tex's room</i>
<i>here and Gideon's.</i>

10:48.284 --> 10:50.152
<i>You take Jean-Louis with you...</i>

10:50.187 --> 10:52.891
Oh, really?

10:52.926 --> 10:55.993
Well, my friend,
you're in luck.

11:07.006 --> 11:09.303
They've got these, uh...

11:09.338 --> 11:12.372
rustic individual bungalows
in the middle of the woods.

11:12.407 --> 11:14.242
-I'll send you a link.

11:14.277 --> 11:15.749
What, in New Hampshire?

11:15.784 --> 11:17.179
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

11:17.214 --> 11:19.214
It's quaint,
it's maximum quaintness.

11:19.249 --> 11:20.787
I'm listening.

11:20.822 --> 11:22.789
I figure we can go up on...

11:22.824 --> 11:24.417
-Mm-hmm.
-...uh...

11:24.452 --> 11:25.924
on Friday night.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.839
Hi, Mom.

11:39.874 --> 11:41.302
Oh, smidge.

11:41.337 --> 11:43.843
Hey. Hey.

11:45.242 --> 11:46.307
Honey.

11:46.342 --> 11:47.946
It's no big deal.

11:47.981 --> 11:51.180
Yeah. How'd it happen?

11:51.215 --> 11:53.413
Riding bikes with Lucy.

11:53.448 --> 11:56.020
You don't know how
to ride a bike.

11:56.055 --> 11:57.923
Yeah, you never let me.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.518
I let you. It's just...

11:59.553 --> 12:01.927
it's dangerous, that's all.

12:01.962 --> 12:03.489
Evidently.

12:07.165 --> 12:08.527
Had you been drinking?

12:11.202 --> 12:12.432
A little bit.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.908
Okay.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.976
All done.

12:27.185 --> 12:30.087
Mom, can you please stop
tucking me in?

12:30.122 --> 12:32.892
You have nothing,
nothing to be scared of.

12:32.927 --> 12:34.487
-I'm not scared.
-No, I know.

12:34.522 --> 12:37.589
It's just, everything
is going to be all right.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.261
I know.

12:42.035 --> 12:44.563
Look, I'm...

12:44.598 --> 12:47.940
I'm sorry that I didn't
respond to your text sooner.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.604
I was at work and my phone
was in the other room.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.276
I know. It's fine.

12:54.311 --> 12:57.015
No, it's not fine.
It's stupid, it's just stupid.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.984
Jesus, Mom, if you're gonna
eat shit about this,

12:59.019 --> 13:00.480
can you please do it
in the other room?

13:00.515 --> 13:03.087
I'm kind of sleepy
from bleeding all evening.

13:03.122 --> 13:05.386
Abbie, what the hell?

13:06.455 --> 13:07.861
Sorry.

13:08.963 --> 13:12.195
Don't curse, please.

13:12.230 --> 13:17.134
So I said, "Can't you just
do this one thing for me?"

13:17.169 --> 13:20.907
And, uh, he asked
what he'd get in return.

13:20.942 --> 13:22.942
And then what happened?

13:22.977 --> 13:26.077
I said he'd be happier

13:26.112 --> 13:29.410
knowing that I'm happy.

13:31.447 --> 13:32.578
Was that enough?

13:32.613 --> 13:34.382
No.

13:35.517 --> 13:37.154
He wanted me to...

13:37.189 --> 13:39.354
to do something for him.

13:41.094 --> 13:43.259
Things for him.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.196
What did you say?

13:46.231 --> 13:49.331
I told him
that he's a piece of shit.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.072
And I told him
that he didn't deserve me.

13:54.107 --> 13:55.304
And I left.

13:55.339 --> 13:57.504
-You said that?
-Yeah.

14:01.312 --> 14:04.115
You did good, hear me?

14:04.150 --> 14:06.414
You're tougher than leather.

14:09.023 --> 14:10.418
Just don't tell anyone I...

14:10.453 --> 14:13.025
Of course I won't.
I would never.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.290
I promise.

14:15.997 --> 14:18.030
It's gonna be
a happy ending for you.

14:20.562 --> 14:23.937
...typically
with replacement therapies,

14:23.972 --> 14:28.469
such as different types
of therapeutic enzymes.

14:28.504 --> 14:31.241
We have also benefited

14:31.276 --> 14:34.475
from novel biologic platforms,

14:34.510 --> 14:37.445
such as gene therapies,

14:37.480 --> 14:39.678
which have proven successful

14:39.713 --> 14:43.022
as part of
our development pipeline.

14:43.057 --> 14:46.487
The overall goal is to develop

14:46.522 --> 14:49.490
a robust manufacturing process

14:49.525 --> 14:52.427
that aligns
with our recent focus

14:52.462 --> 14:54.968
on product attributes

14:55.003 --> 14:57.366
and is critical in generating

14:57.401 --> 15:00.204
quality target product profiles

15:00.239 --> 15:04.241
for novel candidate compounds
in development.

15:04.276 --> 15:07.079
Of course this requires

15:07.114 --> 15:09.642
a tremendous effort...

15:29.796 --> 15:32.203
-Sorry, sorry.

15:32.238 --> 15:33.633
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:33.668 --> 15:35.635
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:14.775 --> 16:16.346
Abbie!

16:16.381 --> 16:17.743
Abbie!

16:17.778 --> 16:19.514
What the fuck?

16:21.452 --> 16:24.123
It's okay. It's okay.

16:24.158 --> 16:25.421
Um...

16:25.456 --> 16:27.192
Are you okay?

16:27.227 --> 16:28.688
Yeah, are<i> you</i> okay?

16:28.723 --> 16:30.459
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

16:30.494 --> 16:31.823
I just...

16:31.858 --> 16:34.562
I just thought something
might have, um...

16:37.237 --> 16:39.204
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, honey, it's fine.

16:39.239 --> 16:41.239
-What happened?
-Nothing.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.374
I just feel a bit off.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.477
I'm going to go take a shower.

16:48.512 --> 16:50.743
Don't go anywhere, okay?

16:50.778 --> 16:52.448
I love you.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.595
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:42.731 --> 17:44.698
Are you sure you're all right?

17:46.603 --> 17:48.240
I threw up.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.374
Must have been something I ate.

17:51.575 --> 17:53.245
I'm feeling much better now.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.742
Do you wanna, like,
lie down or something?

17:55.777 --> 17:57.579
Hmm-mm. What do you want
for dinner?

17:57.614 --> 17:59.284
Don't wanna cook.

17:59.319 --> 18:01.715
I was gonna go to Lucy's.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.487
I'm gonna need you to stay here.

18:04.522 --> 18:07.391
I'm not gonna go biking. Okay?

18:07.426 --> 18:09.228
You go out too much.

18:09.263 --> 18:11.857
I go to Lucy's.
We play Elder Scrolls.

18:11.892 --> 18:13.595
No, you get drunk
and then you carve up--

18:13.630 --> 18:16.466
-Mom, I am 18 years old.
-In two weeks.

18:17.898 --> 18:20.272
Stay home.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.604
-<i> This used</i>
<i>to be quite a place.</i>

18:22.639 --> 18:24.804
<i>It's been deserted</i>
<i>for a long time now.</i>

18:24.839 --> 18:27.774
-<i> Will you take me in?</i>
-<i> Goodness no.</i>

18:27.809 --> 18:30.249
<i>-It isn't safe</i>
<i>out there anymore.</i>

18:30.284 --> 18:31.844
<i>That's why they put up</i>
<i>this barrier.</i>

18:31.879 --> 18:35.947
<i> It would be very easy</i>
<i>to step around it.</i>

18:35.982 --> 18:39.588
<i> What attraction could</i>
<i>there be for you out there?</i>

18:39.623 --> 18:41.491
-<i> I'm not sure.</i>

18:41.526 --> 18:44.494
<i>I'm a reasonable person,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:44.529 --> 18:46.694
<i>Maybe I wanna</i>
<i>satisfy myself...</i>

21:12.908 --> 21:14.875
-Margaret?
-Yes.

21:16.010 --> 21:17.581
Um, I was just wondering

21:17.616 --> 21:19.583
if you could sign off
on my hours--

21:19.618 --> 21:23.081
It's not a good time.
I'm not available
every second, okay?

21:25.591 --> 21:26.887
Okay.

21:39.869 --> 21:41.935
What are you doing?

21:45.006 --> 21:46.511
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

21:46.546 --> 21:48.942
That's fine, keep going,
keep going. Keep going.

21:50.451 --> 21:52.077
-Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
-What is it?

21:52.112 --> 21:53.584
Just, just, just...

21:53.619 --> 21:55.080
Here, here, here.

21:55.115 --> 21:56.587
Come on, come on.

21:56.622 --> 21:58.083
-No, no, stop, stop, stop!
-What?

21:58.118 --> 22:00.690
Okay, just stop.
I'm just not...

22:00.725 --> 22:03.495
into this whole... thing.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.398
-Okay?
-It happens.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.829
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's not that.

22:07.864 --> 22:10.568
I mean, you know me.
It's just...

22:12.165 --> 22:14.473
Since when do we fuck
in the bathroom?

22:14.508 --> 22:15.738
What's with the urgency?

22:15.773 --> 22:16.937
I just felt like it.

22:16.972 --> 22:18.136
Well...

22:18.171 --> 22:19.907
it's not my thing.

22:22.175 --> 22:26.012
If it's not your thing, you
shouldn't have agreed to do it.

22:29.985 --> 22:33.052
Do you wanna go for a crawl
and get some loot?

22:33.087 --> 22:34.119
I'm low.

22:35.859 --> 22:37.859
You wouldn't.

22:37.894 --> 22:39.091
What the fuck?

22:39.126 --> 22:40.862
Hold on.

22:42.162 --> 22:44.965
Okay, now you're just
being creepy.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.133
It's not creepy
to want to look at your child.

22:48.168 --> 22:50.839
No, but you're doing it
in a creepy way.

22:50.874 --> 22:53.446
Sorry.

22:53.481 --> 22:55.008
Mom, what is going on?

22:55.043 --> 22:59.012
You're being like... even more
suffocating than usual.

22:59.047 --> 23:01.113
Just gonna miss you.

23:01.148 --> 23:04.655
I'm... only gonna be
like two hours away.

23:04.690 --> 23:05.788
I know, but...

23:08.023 --> 23:09.792
who's going to protect you?

23:09.827 --> 23:11.992
I don't need protection.

23:12.027 --> 23:15.930
No. You're very strong.

23:15.965 --> 23:17.536
But know that if anyone

23:17.571 --> 23:20.671
so much as touches
a hair on your head,

23:20.706 --> 23:23.542
I will find them
and I will hurt them.

23:23.577 --> 23:27.546
Mom, when you say things
like that,

23:27.581 --> 23:29.581
I mean...

23:29.616 --> 23:32.782
that's for you, not me.

23:32.817 --> 23:35.521
I don't need to hear that.

23:35.556 --> 23:39.756
But you seem to need
to say it an awful lot.

23:40.792 --> 23:42.088
Yeah, well, I'm...

23:42.123 --> 23:44.255
I'm just trying
to tell you that I love you.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.026
Then just say "I love you."

23:48.261 --> 23:49.832
I love you.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.100
There you go.

23:54.135 --> 23:56.003
It's that easy.

23:56.038 --> 23:58.170
Hey, hey, hey.

23:58.205 --> 24:00.645
What?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.779
You wanna drink whiskey?

24:04.079 --> 24:05.749
What?

24:05.784 --> 24:09.588
I figure if you're gonna drink,
I better show you how.

24:13.693 --> 24:14.890
There.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.531
Ready?

24:18.566 --> 24:19.994
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

24:26.002 --> 24:27.298
What the hell is that?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.707
Nothing.

24:29.742 --> 24:31.544
1, 2, 3...

24:35.814 --> 24:37.913
Come on, I raised you
tougher than that.

24:37.948 --> 24:39.178
Again.

25:01.070 --> 25:04.335
Nope. No.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.679
-Nnn...no.
-Abbie, I haven't even
picked out anything yet.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.044
-Can you stop, please?
-It doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna wear it.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.244
Yeah, well, you can't wear
a sweat shirt every single day.

25:12.279 --> 25:14.587
-Apparently I can.
-No, you can't.

25:14.622 --> 25:17.183
If you go to school
dressed like that, people
will think you're weak,

25:17.218 --> 25:19.592
and that is not something
that you want to project.

25:19.627 --> 25:22.628
Oh, is it not something
I want to project, huh, Mom?

25:22.663 --> 25:26.962
Well, then maybe a cracking new
jumper would do just the trick.

25:26.997 --> 25:29.030
It would be just my ticket.

25:32.134 --> 25:33.573
What?

25:39.977 --> 25:41.614
Stay here.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.351
-Abbie.
-Are you okay?

26:26.386 --> 26:27.957
-Come on, let's go.
-Why?

26:27.992 --> 26:29.222
Mom!

26:29.257 --> 26:30.960
You're hurting me, stop!

26:30.995 --> 26:33.798
What are you... Why?
What's going on?

26:33.833 --> 26:35.866
Why are you being weird?

26:35.901 --> 26:39.232
Come on. Just come with me.
Come on, hurry up. Quick!

26:39.267 --> 26:41.069
-No.
-Move it, Abbie, now!

26:41.104 --> 26:43.940
-You're being fucking crazy.
-Abbie, just... just trust me.

26:43.975 --> 26:45.777
Just get in the fucking car.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.009
Ow!

26:51.147 --> 26:52.410
Abbie!

26:54.722 --> 26:56.887
Stop being fucking crazy!

27:02.125 --> 27:03.322
-Go away!

27:03.357 --> 27:04.862
Abbie.

27:04.897 --> 27:07.766
Look... this is just a...

27:09.231 --> 27:11.297
it's a challenging time
for me right now.

27:11.332 --> 27:15.070
There are factors
creating stress in me.

27:15.105 --> 27:19.074
Your going away,
and work, and...

27:20.748 --> 27:22.308
Don't be scared.

27:24.213 --> 27:25.916
I'm on top of it.

27:28.151 --> 27:29.755
Can you hear me?

28:04.121 --> 28:06.517
...a clean data profile
showing anti-amnesic properties

28:06.552 --> 28:08.827
and some neuroprotection
in some models.

28:08.862 --> 28:11.522
I'll kick it to Margaret to
break down the trials for you.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.227
Margaret?

28:15.561 --> 28:17.363
-Margaret?
-Hmm?

28:19.070 --> 28:20.333
The trials.

28:21.875 --> 28:24.172
Right. Right.

28:24.207 --> 28:25.844
It's, um...

28:29.311 --> 28:31.542
Uh, if the phase,
the phase...

28:31.577 --> 28:35.249
a phase-one single
ascending dose, um...

28:37.121 --> 28:38.318
phase...

28:38.353 --> 28:39.517
It's, um, it's in the packet.

28:39.552 --> 28:40.859
It's, uh...

28:42.456 --> 28:44.423
It's, uh, it's in the packet.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.194
Margaret, are you okay?

28:46.229 --> 28:48.031
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

28:48.066 --> 28:49.164
-Fuck!
-Oh!

28:49.199 --> 28:51.133
I'm sorry. Sorry.

28:51.168 --> 28:54.037
I mean, I... I apologize.

28:54.072 --> 28:55.302
I should go.

28:55.337 --> 28:56.435
I...

29:00.210 --> 29:02.309
So sorry for that,
everybody.

29:02.344 --> 29:05.983
Andrew, could you please
get someone to help us clean
this up? Thanks so much.

30:26.934 --> 30:28.230
Go away.

30:30.564 --> 30:32.531
Please, David.

30:32.566 --> 30:34.874
Go away.

30:37.175 --> 30:39.505
You heard me.

30:39.540 --> 30:41.276
Are you speaking to me?

30:41.311 --> 30:45.313
Of course I'm speaking to you.
Why are you here?

30:45.348 --> 30:46.644
What, in the park?

30:48.483 --> 30:51.550
Stay away from me and my kid.

30:51.585 --> 30:53.486
Well...

30:53.521 --> 30:55.455
you approached me, madam.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.193
I don't know who you are.

30:57.228 --> 30:59.129
Don't play fucking games.

30:59.164 --> 31:00.933
Why are you here? Why now?

31:00.968 --> 31:04.134
Okay, you are mistaking me
for someone else.

31:04.169 --> 31:05.630
You piece of shit.

31:05.665 --> 31:09.337
You mother fucking
goddamn piece of shit.

31:09.372 --> 31:11.141
Ben is with me.

31:14.113 --> 31:17.444
Right now, here.

31:20.218 --> 31:21.646
That is a lie!

31:21.681 --> 31:24.286
Madam, if you're
going to raise your voice,

31:24.321 --> 31:26.222
we're going to go...

31:26.257 --> 31:29.555
we're going to go
back to the Boulevard.

31:29.590 --> 31:31.997
Don't walk away from me.
What do you intend to do?

31:32.032 --> 31:34.659
I intend to go home, Margaret.

31:34.694 --> 31:37.101
So you do know who I am.

31:37.136 --> 31:39.202
You introduced yourself to me.

31:39.237 --> 31:41.171
You came up to me,
you shook my hand.

31:41.206 --> 31:43.470
You told me about Abbie.

31:46.013 --> 31:47.639
Don't you remember?

31:58.652 --> 32:00.586
Stay away from my daughter!

32:06.132 --> 32:08.495
"You introduced yourself to me."

32:08.530 --> 32:10.662
"You told me about Abbie."

32:13.799 --> 32:16.239
"We shook hands."

32:16.274 --> 32:17.735
"Shook hands."

32:25.778 --> 32:27.118
Do you know this man?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.647
Yes.

32:28.682 --> 32:30.550
We were...

32:30.585 --> 32:33.520
involved once.

32:33.555 --> 32:36.292
Uh, when did you split up?

32:36.327 --> 32:38.063
Twenty-two years ago.

32:39.627 --> 32:41.231
-Twenty-two years?
-Mm-hmm.

32:41.266 --> 32:43.299
I haven't seen him
since I was 19,

32:43.334 --> 32:46.665
and then about a week ago,
he just, uh, he just appeared.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.667
At your home?

32:48.702 --> 32:50.669
Or a place...?

32:52.079 --> 32:53.507
No, at a conference,

32:53.542 --> 32:55.311
and then in a store,

32:55.346 --> 32:56.609
and then again in a park.

32:56.644 --> 32:57.808
Public places.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.547
Yes, but places
where I happened to be.

33:00.582 --> 33:02.384
-It's not a coincidence.
-I understand.

33:02.419 --> 33:04.716
I'm just trying
to get the facts.

33:04.751 --> 33:09.325
Has this man accosted you,
harassed you?

33:09.360 --> 33:12.130
Not exactly, no.

33:12.165 --> 33:16.035
Okay, has he
initiated contact at all?

33:17.731 --> 33:19.236
No.

33:22.307 --> 33:23.603
But I know him.

33:25.277 --> 33:28.278
I know what he's capable of.

33:28.313 --> 33:29.345
Well, um...

33:29.380 --> 33:31.380
what would you like us to do?

33:31.415 --> 33:34.251
I want you to issue
a protection order.

33:34.286 --> 33:36.616
At the very least,
I want you to contact him

33:36.651 --> 33:38.255
so that he knows
that the police--

33:38.290 --> 33:40.653
Those aren't really
options at the moment.

33:40.688 --> 33:44.261
You're free to file a complaint,
and I can provide you guidelines

33:44.296 --> 33:47.363
on how to deal
with a potential stalker,

33:47.398 --> 33:51.169
but unless you have
something concrete to show
this man's harassing you--

33:51.204 --> 33:54.337
Officer, I can't do nothing.
I can't just sit around
and wait for him to--

33:54.372 --> 33:56.273
There's nothing we can do.

33:56.308 --> 33:58.209
So just...

33:58.244 --> 34:01.773
be smart, be careful,

34:01.808 --> 34:03.841
and don't hesitate
to contact us

34:03.876 --> 34:06.382
if the situation
escalates, okay?

35:06.411 --> 35:08.444
Hey.

35:08.479 --> 35:10.314
It's dark in here.

35:12.351 --> 35:15.253
Yeah. Yeah.

35:15.288 --> 35:18.817
There's only nine days left.

35:18.852 --> 35:21.292
It all went so fast.

35:22.790 --> 35:24.460
Um... I was wondering

35:24.495 --> 35:27.397
if you're going to be doing
my recommendation

35:27.432 --> 35:28.926
or maybe somebody else?

35:28.961 --> 35:31.632
-Me.
-Okay. Cool.

35:33.570 --> 35:36.340
Um... good night.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.343
Gwyn.

35:39.378 --> 35:41.378
Yeah?

35:43.349 --> 35:45.448
Do you think you could
kill someone?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.585
Um...

35:50.620 --> 35:52.422
I mean if you had to.

35:52.457 --> 35:54.424
Them or you?

35:57.660 --> 35:59.957
Uh...

35:59.992 --> 36:02.399
No, I don't think I could.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.402
Why?

36:07.340 --> 36:10.902
-It's nothing.
-Are you okay?

36:10.937 --> 36:14.345
You know, if you need
to talk to somebody, I'm...

36:14.380 --> 36:17.414
I'm actually,
I'm a really good listener.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.880
Have you ever done anything bad?

36:21.915 --> 36:25.422
Like... like bad?

36:27.019 --> 36:28.986
Yeah.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.988
I have.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.792
Why?

36:34.697 --> 36:36.994
I did something bad.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.897
When I was young.

36:40.703 --> 36:42.373
Unforgiveable.

36:43.574 --> 36:45.310
Well, what was it?

36:46.874 --> 36:48.643
I won't tell anyone.

36:48.678 --> 36:50.546
I promise.

36:52.484 --> 36:53.945
Fort Knox.

36:59.359 --> 37:01.689
I was 18.

37:01.724 --> 37:03.724
And I, well...

37:05.024 --> 37:07.695
...my parents,
they were biologists.

37:07.730 --> 37:10.698
They're dead now.

37:10.733 --> 37:14.339
But after school,
I took a gap year

37:14.374 --> 37:16.539
and traveled with them
from London

37:16.574 --> 37:19.938
to a research facility
on the Queen Charlotte Islands,

37:19.973 --> 37:22.512
off the western coast
of Canada.

37:24.351 --> 37:25.944
I drew a lot back then.

37:27.717 --> 37:30.454
I wanted to be an artist.

37:30.489 --> 37:33.985
Thought that being in nature
would inspire me creatively.

37:35.890 --> 37:37.659
It didn't.

37:37.694 --> 37:39.430
It was cold and boring

37:39.465 --> 37:41.333
and there was hardly
anybody there.

37:43.700 --> 37:44.996
But there was this...

37:45.031 --> 37:47.933
man.

37:47.968 --> 37:53.345
Another biologist
from some university up north.

37:53.380 --> 37:55.809
David was his name.

37:58.011 --> 38:01.881
And he was handsome
and charismatic.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.917
And he noticed me.

38:07.394 --> 38:08.690
Of course he noticed me,

38:08.725 --> 38:11.022
an 18-year-old
in that remote place.

38:13.862 --> 38:15.763
And he went about it right.

38:17.701 --> 38:19.998
Charmed mom and dad first.

38:21.804 --> 38:24.475
Oh, they just fell
in love with him.

38:26.072 --> 38:29.909
Before you knew it, it was
the four of us all the time.

38:29.944 --> 38:33.484
He'd entertain us,
tell us stories.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.684
Give me wine.

38:35.719 --> 38:37.521
Pills.

38:41.593 --> 38:44.462
After a few weeks,
I moved in with him.

38:45.993 --> 38:49.401
My parents, they were...
they were hippies.

38:49.436 --> 38:52.096
Naive, stupid.

38:52.131 --> 38:55.506
I told them I was grown up,
and they believed me.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.511
At first it was wonderful.

39:00.546 --> 39:03.481
I was his muse, I inspired him.

39:03.516 --> 39:05.681
He said he was on the verge
of a breakthrough.

39:05.716 --> 39:06.979
I didn't question it.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.179
All I knew was
that for the first time,

39:09.214 --> 39:12.754
I felt important
and appreciated.

39:14.989 --> 39:17.759
So I didn't object
when he started asking me

39:17.794 --> 39:20.465
to do things.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.468
"Kindnesses," he called them.

39:23.503 --> 39:25.866
They were little things
at first.

39:25.901 --> 39:27.967
Cooking, cleaning.

39:28.002 --> 39:29.870
He told me not to draw.

39:29.905 --> 39:32.037
Told me not to wear shoes.

39:32.072 --> 39:34.006
Even outside.

39:36.714 --> 39:39.044
But the kindnesses,
they evolved.

39:39.079 --> 39:41.618
Became tests.

39:41.653 --> 39:43.587
Endurance tests.

39:44.722 --> 39:46.953
Meditation for hours.

39:46.988 --> 39:48.592
Fasting for days.

39:48.627 --> 39:50.088
Poses.

39:50.123 --> 39:52.189
Stress positions.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.830
After a kindness,

39:55.865 --> 40:00.098
he would shower me
with praise and affection.

40:00.133 --> 40:04.905
The more I did,
the more inspired he became.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.545
Said he could see the future.

40:07.580 --> 40:10.581
Said he could hear God
whispering his name.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.783
And I believed him.

40:17.150 --> 40:19.953
I believed every
goddamn thing he said.

40:22.254 --> 40:26.223
And whatever he requested,
I could hack it.

40:27.963 --> 40:29.259
And if I couldn't,

40:29.294 --> 40:32.999
he'd tell me to burn myself
with cigarettes.

40:33.034 --> 40:35.067
But I could hack that, too.

40:38.644 --> 40:42.547
Winter came and my parents left.

40:42.582 --> 40:43.878
But I stayed.

40:45.618 --> 40:47.211
I was so stupid and fucked up.

40:47.246 --> 40:51.116
It was five months before I even
realized that I was pregnant.

40:53.989 --> 40:57.254
David told me
not to tell anyone.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.993
He forbade me from giving birth.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.568
I tried to stop it.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.165
It kept growing.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.641
And whatever I did,

41:10.676 --> 41:12.775
no matter how much
I could take...

41:14.306 --> 41:17.142
David wasn't inspired anymore.

41:22.116 --> 41:24.050
I gave birth on the bed.

41:24.085 --> 41:25.623
No drugs.

41:25.658 --> 41:27.086
No doctors.

41:29.860 --> 41:32.795
I looked at my baby and...

41:32.830 --> 41:36.700
immediately I realized
why I'd been put on this Earth.

41:38.737 --> 41:40.836
I named him Benjamin.

41:44.941 --> 41:46.809
For a few weeks
it was all right.

41:46.844 --> 41:49.911
David didn't pay much attention,
but I cared for him.

41:51.882 --> 41:55.884
I didn't think
I could love anything
more than I loved David.

41:55.919 --> 41:58.051
But Ben proved me wrong.

42:00.957 --> 42:02.825
David, David knew that.

42:06.732 --> 42:10.602
One day he asked me
to go into town for supplies.

42:10.637 --> 42:13.704
I'd never let my baby
out of my sight until then.

42:16.973 --> 42:20.139
When I came back, two of Ben's
fingers were on the counter.

42:20.174 --> 42:22.075
That's all that was left.

42:24.277 --> 42:27.817
I begged David to tell me
what he'd done with him, but...

42:29.854 --> 42:32.591
all he'd say was
that he'd eaten him up.

42:34.793 --> 42:37.255
"He's in my belly now, Maggie."

42:38.764 --> 42:40.698
That's what he'd say.

42:40.733 --> 42:43.866
Over and over.

42:45.969 --> 42:47.969
So I went to bed
and stayed there.

42:48.004 --> 42:50.774
I stopped eating,
my baby was dead.

42:52.778 --> 42:55.647
But David, David just kept
saying he wasn't.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.815
He was...

43:00.115 --> 43:01.983
inside.

43:04.724 --> 43:06.119
Said he could feel him moving,

43:06.154 --> 43:08.792
said he could hear him crying.

43:08.827 --> 43:10.860
Crying out for me.

43:12.930 --> 43:15.766
And after a while...

43:18.067 --> 43:20.001
I could hear him, too.

43:22.709 --> 43:25.138
Suffering.

43:25.173 --> 43:26.678
Trapped.

43:28.946 --> 43:30.176
But alive.

43:33.951 --> 43:35.280
It went on for weeks.

43:35.315 --> 43:38.184
David wouldn't let me
come near him unless...

43:38.219 --> 43:43.090
The kindnesses,
they became very hard.

43:44.390 --> 43:46.423
And I did my best.

43:49.197 --> 43:52.462
But I guess I wasn't
as tough as we thought.

43:54.499 --> 43:55.971
So I ran.

43:56.006 --> 43:58.809
Stole some money,
the truck, and ran east,

43:58.844 --> 44:01.713
to America, where I thought
he'd never find me.

44:07.182 --> 44:09.446
I've never told anyone that
in my whole life.

44:09.481 --> 44:11.151
You should be honored.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.965
I don't understand.

44:24.804 --> 44:26.034
I let it happen.

44:26.069 --> 44:27.772
I let him hurt me.

44:27.807 --> 44:30.236
I let him poison
my brain with lies

44:30.271 --> 44:32.436
and then I let him
kill my child,

44:32.471 --> 44:34.339
and then I ran.

44:39.082 --> 44:41.181
I don't get it.

44:41.216 --> 44:42.952
Is this...

44:42.987 --> 44:44.415
Is this some kind of joke,

44:44.450 --> 44:46.824
or is this a test for me?

44:46.859 --> 44:49.024
Because that's horrible.

44:49.059 --> 44:50.421
I'm sorry.

44:52.997 --> 44:54.931
I'm sorry, I...

44:54.966 --> 44:58.033
I shouldn't have said anything.

44:58.068 --> 45:01.102
Just go home
and forget it ever happened.

45:03.073 --> 45:04.402
Okay.

45:06.076 --> 45:07.504
Feel better.

45:15.019 --> 45:16.755
"We shook hands."

45:17.956 --> 45:19.318
"Shook hands."

45:19.353 --> 45:20.891
"Then we went to..."

45:20.926 --> 45:23.520
"I went to the Boulevard."

45:23.555 --> 45:25.764
Boulevard.

45:27.394 --> 45:28.767
Boulevard.

46:59.651 --> 47:02.322
-Thanks, hon.
-You're welcome.

47:02.357 --> 47:04.192
Good morning, Maggie.

47:06.394 --> 47:08.229
Take a seat, darling.

47:20.672 --> 47:22.474
You're beautiful.

47:22.509 --> 47:24.674
Still beautiful.

47:24.709 --> 47:26.379
You look like shit.

47:26.414 --> 47:29.250
I know.

47:29.285 --> 47:31.252
Distinguished shit, all right?

47:31.287 --> 47:33.683
Get out of town. Now.

47:33.718 --> 47:38.127
If you don't go, I will do
whatever I have to do.

47:38.162 --> 47:39.326
I will.

47:39.361 --> 47:40.690
Relax.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.362
We'll be fine.

47:42.397 --> 47:43.627
All of us.

47:43.662 --> 47:45.464
Me, you...

47:45.499 --> 47:46.938
Abbie.

47:46.973 --> 47:49.303
Are you threatening my daughter?

47:49.338 --> 47:52.471
Threaten? God no.
I don't make threats.

47:52.506 --> 47:54.605
Seems to me, you're the one
making threats at this table.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.113
You're goddamn right I am.

47:59.678 --> 48:01.612
So where's the father?

48:01.647 --> 48:03.317
She doesn't have one.

48:03.352 --> 48:04.483
Oh.

48:04.518 --> 48:06.122
Well, that's quite a trick.

48:06.157 --> 48:07.519
No, it's not.

48:07.554 --> 48:11.193
I went to bars, I met men.
It was easy.

48:11.228 --> 48:13.063
Does she have your magic?

48:13.098 --> 48:16.000
Your gifts?

48:16.035 --> 48:19.267
She's certainly not
a gifted cyclist, right?

48:19.302 --> 48:22.501
I went to the police.
I can have you arrested
at any time.

48:22.536 --> 48:24.074
Arrested? For what?

48:24.109 --> 48:26.208
Drinking tea in a diner
or sitting in a park?

48:26.243 --> 48:28.309
-What?
-Why are you here?

48:28.344 --> 48:32.511
Because he's still inside me.

48:32.546 --> 48:34.249
Here.

48:34.284 --> 48:36.185
-Suffering.
-Don't.

48:36.220 --> 48:38.220
-Every day he cries...
-Just stop it now.

48:38.255 --> 48:39.683
...he screams,
"Where is Mother?"

48:39.718 --> 48:41.388
-"Why did she abandon me?"
-Shut up.

48:41.423 --> 48:43.720
I tell him to let go,
I say, "Your mother ran."

48:43.755 --> 48:45.722
-"She ran from her baby."
-No, lies!

48:45.757 --> 48:48.065
But he refuses,
he just hangs on.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.627
-He should hate you...
-You lying...

48:49.662 --> 48:52.069
-...but he yearns for you.
-...insane, fucking pig!

48:52.104 --> 48:54.434
You protest too much.

48:54.469 --> 48:56.238
I know you know.

48:56.273 --> 48:57.470
He's alive.

48:57.505 --> 48:59.274
I've kept him so.

48:59.309 --> 49:01.441
I took good care.

49:01.476 --> 49:05.478
He's here, thanks to my charity.

49:05.513 --> 49:07.744
Any minute,
I could change my mind.

49:07.779 --> 49:09.713
I could purge the boy,

49:09.748 --> 49:12.353
put him out
of his fucking misery.

49:14.357 --> 49:17.160
Thought you didn't make threats.

49:17.195 --> 49:19.657
Well, if the boy's dead,
where is the threat?

49:22.431 --> 49:24.332
What do you want?

49:24.367 --> 49:26.136
I want...

49:27.238 --> 49:28.567
a kindness.

49:30.175 --> 49:32.538
It would be, I think,

49:32.573 --> 49:37.411
right if, from now on,
you didn't drive to work.

49:37.446 --> 49:39.512
Instead you walk.

49:39.547 --> 49:42.746
Barefoot, no shoes, no socks,

49:42.781 --> 49:45.188
you know, every day.

49:45.223 --> 49:47.652
And then what, hmm? Then what?

49:47.687 --> 49:49.720
I'm giving you a gift.

49:49.755 --> 49:51.161
You see that, right?

49:51.196 --> 49:54.131
Do this simple thing

49:54.166 --> 49:56.694
and life goes on undisturbed.

49:56.729 --> 49:59.466
Till the next thing,
and then the next.
I know how this works.

49:59.501 --> 50:01.072
No, no, no, no, no.
I promise.

50:01.107 --> 50:02.634
You just do as I ask.

50:02.669 --> 50:04.834
You don't follow me,
you don't meddle in my affairs.

50:04.869 --> 50:07.837
You just do this and I vanish.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.410
You arrogant, fucking...

50:09.445 --> 50:12.446
I don't do what you say anymore,
you understand?

50:12.481 --> 50:13.744
I don't negotiate.

50:13.779 --> 50:16.450
I don't take orders,
I don't look away.

50:16.485 --> 50:17.682
So whatever you think

50:17.717 --> 50:18.848
that you're doing,

50:18.883 --> 50:20.553
it'll fail,

50:20.588 --> 50:23.292
because I'll be there ready.

50:23.327 --> 50:24.524
Come after me,

50:24.559 --> 50:26.295
come after my child,

50:26.330 --> 50:28.264
I swear to God,

50:28.299 --> 50:30.464
I will kill you.

50:33.535 --> 50:36.239
You kill me, you kill him.

50:36.274 --> 50:40.243
There is no him.

50:42.544 --> 50:45.842
I just want you to be happy.

50:49.419 --> 50:51.188
That's why I'm here.

50:55.227 --> 50:57.392
Barefoot, every morning.

50:59.429 --> 51:01.330
We wouldn't want
any more accidents.

51:30.790 --> 51:32.130
Oh, fuck.

52:12.832 --> 52:14.865
Happy now, you piece of shit?!

52:14.900 --> 52:16.801
Now, you disappear.

52:16.836 --> 52:18.902
Now, you fucking disappear!

52:28.485 --> 52:30.485
Naan?

52:30.520 --> 52:32.322
I think you need
to see somebody.

52:32.357 --> 52:33.488
Oh?

52:36.757 --> 52:39.527
I think you're having
an episode.

52:39.562 --> 52:42.266
What? Oh, no.
Everything's fine.

52:42.301 --> 52:44.334
You've got nothing
to worry about, I promise.

52:44.369 --> 52:45.797
There.

52:45.832 --> 52:47.304
There you go.

52:49.572 --> 52:50.835
That said...

52:50.870 --> 52:52.903
I'm gonna need you
to help me out

52:52.938 --> 52:54.872
by being extra careful
for a little bit.

52:54.907 --> 52:56.412
Okay?

52:56.447 --> 52:58.447
If anyone approaches you
that you don't know,

52:58.482 --> 53:00.482
tries to talk to you,
you don't engage,

53:00.517 --> 53:02.352
you go away immediately.

53:03.586 --> 53:04.849
Why?

53:08.360 --> 53:12.329
Because someone is
behaving erratically.

53:13.563 --> 53:14.595
Who?

53:14.630 --> 53:16.267
Someone from work.

53:16.302 --> 53:18.797
Okay? Someone I had to let go.

53:18.832 --> 53:20.766
Is making trouble.

53:20.801 --> 53:22.735
What's his name?

53:22.770 --> 53:24.704
This guy?

53:27.577 --> 53:29.709
David Moore.

53:29.744 --> 53:32.008
David Moore?

53:32.043 --> 53:34.043
Yeah. British guy.

53:34.078 --> 53:35.616
About 60.

53:36.883 --> 53:38.289
You never mentioned

53:38.324 --> 53:40.291
any other British people
at your work.

53:40.326 --> 53:42.788
I did, I'm sure I did.

53:44.495 --> 53:46.627
Okay, then I'll...

53:46.662 --> 53:49.366
stay away
from old Brit David Moore.

53:49.401 --> 53:50.961
Stay away from anyone
you don't know

53:50.996 --> 53:53.370
until I say "all clear."

53:55.605 --> 53:58.034
Here. That's chicken.

54:33.511 --> 54:36.039
<i> ...who was killed</i>
<i>in an invasion of his own home</i>

54:36.074 --> 54:38.778
<i>by a high-powered rifle shot</i>
<i>from some distance away.</i>

54:38.813 --> 54:41.550
<i>Seems to have come to some</i>
<i>sort of a conclusion here.</i>

54:41.585 --> 54:43.684
<i>The fugitive, wanted</i>
<i>for two and a half years,</i>

54:43.719 --> 54:45.983
<i>James Cobb,</i>
<i>in part wanted because...</i>

54:46.018 --> 54:48.953
Why are you here?

54:48.988 --> 54:51.923
I'm visiting a friend.

54:54.400 --> 54:55.531
Come here.

55:03.167 --> 55:04.573
What friend?

55:06.005 --> 55:09.908
His name is, uh, David Moore.

55:11.582 --> 55:12.680
No David.

55:13.716 --> 55:14.748
No, there is.

55:14.783 --> 55:16.552
No David here.

55:16.587 --> 55:18.048
I know that he's staying here.

55:18.083 --> 55:20.490
Rent room or get out.

55:24.496 --> 55:27.365
Rent room or get out!

55:30.062 --> 55:31.534
How much?

58:19.099 --> 58:21.165
Get out! Get out!

58:21.200 --> 58:23.970
Now! Now, now, now, now, now!

58:24.005 --> 58:26.940
Get out! Get out!

59:09.314 --> 59:11.985
Text me, on the hour,
every hour.

59:12.020 --> 59:13.921
Just to let me know
that you're okay.

59:13.956 --> 59:17.793
Just, just write "okay."
Can you do that?

59:17.828 --> 59:21.357
How about I, uh,
I'll make it worth your while?

59:21.392 --> 59:24.360
$20 a text, hmm?

59:24.395 --> 59:27.231
That's a pretty good way
to make some pocket money.

59:27.266 --> 59:28.903
Don't you think, smidge?

59:30.038 --> 59:31.136
Smidgen?

1:01:17.948 --> 1:01:19.178
-Pow.

1:01:47.274 --> 1:01:48.746
What is this?

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:52.277
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:01:52.312 --> 1:01:53.982
-Margaret.
-What is he doing here?

1:01:54.017 --> 1:01:56.116
Relax. Why don't you
take a seat?

1:01:56.151 --> 1:01:58.019
Can you answer
the question, Abbie?

1:01:58.054 --> 1:01:59.955
-I called him.
-You did... did what?

1:01:59.990 --> 1:02:02.122
She's concerned.
All right, I'm concerned.

1:02:02.157 --> 1:02:05.059
You haven't been to work
in a week, and Abbie says
you're out...

1:02:05.094 --> 1:02:07.963
-You let a total stranger
into our house.
-...every night, all night.

1:02:07.998 --> 1:02:10.196
-He's your boyfriend, isn't he?
-I don't have a boyfriend.

1:02:10.231 --> 1:02:13.331
Don't treat me like
I'm a fucking infant,
I know what you two do.

1:02:13.366 --> 1:02:15.872
-Don't cuss.
-The point is,
we're here to help.

1:02:15.907 --> 1:02:17.104
I'm fine.

1:02:17.139 --> 1:02:21.075
You are not fine!

1:02:21.110 --> 1:02:22.813
I need to talk to you
on our own.

1:02:22.848 --> 1:02:24.474
Abbie, can you give us a minute?

1:02:24.509 --> 1:02:26.982
-I'm just trying to help you.
-Can you go to your room now?

1:02:27.017 --> 1:02:28.049
-Please!
-Now.

1:02:28.084 --> 1:02:29.215
-Please?
-Abbie.

1:02:29.250 --> 1:02:30.986
Go to your fucking room.

1:02:43.231 --> 1:02:45.231
How dare you come
to my house uninvited?

1:02:45.266 --> 1:02:47.563
It's important that I know
that you're all right.

1:02:47.598 --> 1:02:50.335
Well, I am all right.
As far as you're concerned,
I'm always all right.

1:02:50.370 --> 1:02:53.437
Look, we're friends.
Okay, no, we are friends,

1:02:53.472 --> 1:02:55.604
and when I see a friend
that's in trouble...

1:02:55.639 --> 1:02:57.243
I am handling it, okay?

1:02:57.278 --> 1:03:00.015
I'm doing what I have to do
to protect myself

1:03:00.050 --> 1:03:01.412
and my daughter from harm!

1:03:01.447 --> 1:03:03.348
What harm? Margaret?

1:03:04.582 --> 1:03:06.417
It's none of your business.

1:03:06.452 --> 1:03:07.957
Look...

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:10.190
I, uh...

1:03:10.225 --> 1:03:13.160
I have a number here.

1:03:13.195 --> 1:03:15.096
It's for a good woman, okay?

1:03:15.131 --> 1:03:16.526
-A psychiatrist.
-What the fuck?

1:03:16.561 --> 1:03:18.902
No, just stop.
You are overstepping.

1:03:18.937 --> 1:03:20.629
I owe you nothing!

1:03:20.664 --> 1:03:22.939
If I don't return your calls,
you suck it up.

1:03:22.974 --> 1:03:25.601
You don't pop in and you
certainly don't discuss me

1:03:25.636 --> 1:03:28.076
or anything else
with my goddamn daughter.

1:03:28.111 --> 1:03:30.914
-What harm, Margaret?
-If you think that I
would let anything

1:03:30.949 --> 1:03:32.509
happen to her,
you are mistaken!

1:03:32.544 --> 1:03:34.412
I would do anything,

1:03:34.447 --> 1:03:36.953
sacrifice anything
for my children.

1:03:36.988 --> 1:03:40.286
For them, I'm unstoppable.
I'm a goddamn champion!

1:03:40.321 --> 1:03:42.552
Children?

1:03:42.587 --> 1:03:45.489
When was the last time
you slept?

1:03:48.296 --> 1:03:51.099
You need to get out.

1:03:51.134 --> 1:03:52.199
Oh, come on.

1:03:53.268 --> 1:03:54.498
-Get out.
-All right.

1:03:54.533 --> 1:03:55.906
All right.

1:03:58.570 --> 1:04:02.011
-This is the person
I was talking about.
-Get the fuck out!

1:04:10.549 --> 1:04:13.616
If that buzzer rings,
you don't answer for anyone.

1:04:13.651 --> 1:04:15.288
Do not open that door.

1:04:15.323 --> 1:04:18.225
Do not leave this apartment,
ever, for anything,

1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:19.996
unless I'm with you,
do you understand?

1:04:20.031 --> 1:04:22.460
You can't keep me as a prisoner,
I'm an adult.

1:04:22.495 --> 1:04:24.462
No, you're a child, and you'll
do what I fucking say!

1:04:35.981 --> 1:04:38.146
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.

1:04:38.181 --> 1:04:39.378
Hey, I'm sorry.

1:04:39.413 --> 1:04:40.643
Mommy, you lied to me.

1:04:42.746 --> 1:04:44.218
I called your office.

1:04:44.253 --> 1:04:46.924
Nobody named David Moore
ever worked there.

1:04:48.389 --> 1:04:50.224
Yeah.

1:04:50.259 --> 1:04:52.061
He's not from work.

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:55.394
He's from when I was young,
and he wants to hurt us.

1:04:55.429 --> 1:04:57.528
But I won't let that happen.

1:04:57.563 --> 1:05:00.069
And I'm sorry
that I couldn't tell you.

1:05:02.601 --> 1:05:04.601
You're lying to me again.

1:05:04.636 --> 1:05:05.976
I'm not.

1:05:06.011 --> 1:05:07.538
Mom, there's no guy.

1:05:07.573 --> 1:05:09.441
You're just...

1:05:11.148 --> 1:05:12.411
You're just saying all this.

1:05:12.446 --> 1:05:14.545
You're just making this up
to keep me here,

1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:15.645
to control me.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:17.020
No, no, I'm not.

1:05:17.055 --> 1:05:19.682
Mom, I'm... I'm all grown up,

1:05:19.717 --> 1:05:22.388
and I'm gonna go away
and you can't take it.

1:05:22.423 --> 1:05:25.490
No, smidge, that's...
that's not right.

1:05:25.525 --> 1:05:27.162
You have to stop.

1:05:28.429 --> 1:05:29.692
It'll all be over soon...

1:05:29.727 --> 1:05:32.002
Whatever this is, Mom...

1:05:32.037 --> 1:05:34.400
you have to stop,
it has to stop.

1:05:34.435 --> 1:05:35.698
I can't take it.

1:05:35.733 --> 1:05:38.470
It'll all be over,
it'll all be over soon.

1:05:40.672 --> 1:05:42.573
It has to be over now.

1:05:44.709 --> 1:05:46.313
Or I'm gonna leave.

1:05:48.812 --> 1:05:50.746
I'll go.

1:05:50.781 --> 1:05:52.715
I will.

1:05:52.750 --> 1:05:54.783
And you won't be able
to stop me.

1:05:54.818 --> 1:05:56.785
No, no.

1:05:56.820 --> 1:05:58.556
Shh! It's all right.

1:05:58.591 --> 1:06:00.525
You're safe here.

1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:02.626
I don't feel safe with you.

1:06:08.601 --> 1:06:10.436
Come here. Come here.

1:06:10.471 --> 1:06:11.701
Come here.

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:17.773
It'll all be over.

1:06:19.546 --> 1:06:20.743
Tomorrow.

1:06:22.450 --> 1:06:23.680
I promise.

1:07:29.781 --> 1:07:31.649
You kill me,
you kill him.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:13.889
Don't move.

1:08:13.924 --> 1:08:15.495
I have a gun.

1:08:18.929 --> 1:08:20.929
You know he's here?

1:08:20.964 --> 1:08:23.536
He's right here.

1:08:23.571 --> 1:08:25.307
That's why you couldn't fire.

1:08:25.342 --> 1:08:27.903
He's dead,
and you fucking killed him.

1:08:27.938 --> 1:08:31.181
You know, he's very upset
that we're arguing.

1:08:31.216 --> 1:08:32.545
Listen.

1:08:33.647 --> 1:08:34.778
Listen.

1:08:34.813 --> 1:08:36.351
You hear him cry?

1:08:37.453 --> 1:08:39.783
Shh!

1:08:39.818 --> 1:08:41.587
Listen.

1:08:41.622 --> 1:08:43.259
Can you hear?

1:08:44.757 --> 1:08:46.196
Can you hear?

1:08:47.991 --> 1:08:49.595
Get the fuck off me, you fuck!

1:08:49.630 --> 1:08:51.729
Listen. Listen!

1:08:53.997 --> 1:08:55.238
Listen.

1:08:55.273 --> 1:08:57.471
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

1:08:57.506 --> 1:08:59.638
-Shh-shh-shh-shh!
-He's dead.

1:08:59.673 --> 1:09:01.508
Listen to your son.

1:09:16.921 --> 1:09:20.956
He can't understand why
you allowed this to happen,

1:09:20.991 --> 1:09:25.367
why you let him get hurt,

1:09:25.402 --> 1:09:27.897
why you ran.

1:09:27.932 --> 1:09:29.998
What kind of a mother

1:09:30.033 --> 1:09:33.639
abandons her child
when he needs her most?

1:09:35.511 --> 1:09:39.810
Are you going to fail him,
Maggie, again?

1:09:41.649 --> 1:09:43.814
Is Ben inside me?

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.991
Stay away from my daughter.

1:09:58.699 --> 1:10:00.732
She's just a substitute.

1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:04.274
I held up my end.

1:10:04.309 --> 1:10:07.343
But you, you followed me,
you tried to kill me,

1:10:07.378 --> 1:10:08.806
in breach of our deal.

1:10:08.841 --> 1:10:10.676
I think...

1:10:10.711 --> 1:10:12.843
I think this calls
for a kindness.

1:10:12.878 --> 1:10:14.977
Assume the position.

1:10:15.012 --> 1:10:17.914
In the park, Washington Park,
two o'clock till dawn,

1:10:17.949 --> 1:10:20.521
every night
until further notice.

1:10:20.556 --> 1:10:21.621
Right?

1:10:21.656 --> 1:10:23.392
Go near her, I'll kill you.

1:10:23.427 --> 1:10:26.428
If you want to keep her safe,
then you do as I ask.

1:10:26.463 --> 1:10:27.726
It's that simple.

1:10:27.761 --> 1:10:30.927
I hold up my end, Maggie,
always have.

1:10:30.962 --> 1:10:33.699
This is not the time
for recklessness.

1:10:33.734 --> 1:10:36.636
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.

1:10:36.671 --> 1:10:38.033
I'll fucking kill you...

1:10:51.488 --> 1:10:52.685
Mom.

1:11:00.398 --> 1:11:01.826
Happy birthday.

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:04.928
Don't come after me.

1:11:06.129 --> 1:11:07.766
Don't call me.

1:11:09.066 --> 1:11:10.967
Baby, I fucked up.

1:11:12.905 --> 1:11:15.378
I just left him there...

1:11:15.413 --> 1:11:17.776
with that man.

1:11:17.811 --> 1:11:21.109
I should burn in hell
for what I did.

1:11:21.144 --> 1:11:23.045
Go to the doctor.

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:25.322
You'll be okay.

1:11:28.426 --> 1:11:29.689
What?

1:11:29.724 --> 1:11:31.889
-Abbie.

1:11:31.924 --> 1:11:33.627
-Abbie, no!

1:11:33.662 --> 1:11:35.057
No!

1:11:36.896 --> 1:11:40.799
Abbie! Abbie, talk to me.
Come on, please don't do this.

1:11:40.834 --> 1:11:41.965
Just talk to me!

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.100
Abbie? Abbie!

1:11:45.135 --> 1:11:47.839
Abbie, stop!

1:11:47.874 --> 1:11:50.578
He wants to hurt you!

1:11:50.613 --> 1:11:52.008
Abbie, don't!

1:11:52.043 --> 1:11:53.812
Abbie! Abbie, open the door.

1:11:53.847 --> 1:11:56.650
-Drive! Now, please!
Drive the car!
-You Abigail?

1:11:56.685 --> 1:11:58.553
-Yes, I'm Abigail.
Start the car!
-Please!

1:11:58.588 --> 1:12:00.621
-Look at me!
Abbie, don't go!
-Drive! Drive!

1:12:00.656 --> 1:12:01.820
Abbie, don't go!

1:12:01.855 --> 1:12:03.789
Abbie!

1:12:37.055 --> 1:12:39.121
Motherfucker.

1:12:40.795 --> 1:12:42.960
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:12:42.995 --> 1:12:45.028
You fucking piece of shit.

1:12:45.063 --> 1:12:46.436
-Margaret? Hey!
-Shit!

1:12:47.604 --> 1:12:48.801
Were you fucking spying on me?

1:12:48.836 --> 1:12:50.132
-Huh?
-Stop it!

1:12:50.167 --> 1:12:52.607
-Were you fucking spying on me?
-Fuck! Margaret!

1:12:52.642 --> 1:12:54.004
Goddamn it.

1:12:54.039 --> 1:12:57.513
-Why are you here?
-I was worried about you.

1:12:57.548 --> 1:12:59.713
What did I tell you? Huh?

1:12:59.748 --> 1:13:02.782
What did I tell you?
Stay away from me.
My children are in danger.

1:13:02.817 --> 1:13:04.212
I don't have time
for your bullshit.

1:13:04.247 --> 1:13:05.752
You are sick, all right?

1:13:05.787 --> 1:13:07.556
You're sick
and you need help and...

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:08.689
And what?

1:13:08.724 --> 1:13:10.625
And I am in love with you.

1:13:12.024 --> 1:13:13.661
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:13:13.696 --> 1:13:14.992
Didn't you know?

1:13:15.027 --> 1:13:16.631
Fucking men.

1:13:16.666 --> 1:13:18.468
You can't stick your dick
in anything

1:13:18.503 --> 1:13:20.800
without deciding that you
love it or you hate it.

1:13:20.835 --> 1:13:24.067
You don't love me,
you just annoy me.

1:13:24.102 --> 1:13:27.741
Impede my mission once more and
I'll beat you till you're dead.

1:13:34.651 --> 1:13:36.013
Okay.

1:13:36.048 --> 1:13:37.718
Okay.

1:13:37.753 --> 1:13:39.489
Fuck.

1:13:42.725 --> 1:13:44.153
Don't worry!

1:13:44.188 --> 1:13:45.957
They're coming.
They're coming for you.

1:13:45.992 --> 1:13:47.761
They're...

1:13:47.796 --> 1:13:49.664
They're coming for you.

1:13:53.934 --> 1:13:55.164
No, no, no.

1:13:55.199 --> 1:13:56.572
No.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:09.519
Abbie? Abbie, it's nearly- 30,
and I don't know where you are.

1:14:09.554 --> 1:14:10.718
Will you call me?

1:14:12.051 --> 1:14:13.182
Please, call me.

1:14:13.217 --> 1:14:14.920
Just, when you get this,
just call.

1:14:14.955 --> 1:14:17.087
<i>Just, please, just...</i>

1:14:17.122 --> 1:14:18.792
<i>just let me know</i>
<i>that you're okay.</i>

1:14:18.827 --> 1:14:22.191
Shh! I can protect you.

1:14:22.226 --> 1:14:24.666
I will keep you safe.

1:14:24.701 --> 1:14:27.097
I will not fail you again.

1:15:58.256 --> 1:15:59.860
Yes?

1:15:59.895 --> 1:16:01.961
<i> Uh, there's</i>
<i>a man here to see you.</i>

1:16:07.738 --> 1:16:09.199
All right.

1:16:17.176 --> 1:16:18.879
Ballion.

1:16:18.914 --> 1:16:21.915
The girl at the desk
said your name was Ballion.

1:16:21.950 --> 1:16:26.051
Ballion. What is that,
French or something?

1:16:26.086 --> 1:16:28.350
I mean, what's wrong
with "Walsh"?

1:16:28.385 --> 1:16:30.022
Maggie Mary Walsh.

1:16:30.057 --> 1:16:31.661
It's a fine name.

1:16:33.863 --> 1:16:37.128
So tell me,
how was it last night?

1:16:37.163 --> 1:16:40.769
They still work, don't they,
the kindnesses?

1:16:40.804 --> 1:16:44.168
Ease the pain, quiet the noise.

1:16:44.203 --> 1:16:46.269
Make you proud.

1:16:52.717 --> 1:16:53.749
Look at them.

1:16:53.784 --> 1:16:57.280
They have no idea.

1:16:59.383 --> 1:17:01.218
You do realize that I'm

1:17:01.253 --> 1:17:04.188
the only person
that can see you,

1:17:04.223 --> 1:17:06.993
who really knows who you are.

1:17:07.028 --> 1:17:10.128
These people, they don't
have the first inkling

1:17:10.163 --> 1:17:11.965
of what you're capable of.

1:17:13.804 --> 1:17:16.134
You're a warrior.

1:17:16.169 --> 1:17:18.004
You're a champion.

1:17:21.911 --> 1:17:23.042
Well...

1:17:28.819 --> 1:17:31.182
I'm the only one that knows.

1:17:31.217 --> 1:17:34.757
I'm the only one that can
see the hole right there

1:17:34.792 --> 1:17:37.859
in the center of your heart.

1:17:37.894 --> 1:17:40.862
This... life,

1:17:40.897 --> 1:17:42.732
this...

1:17:42.767 --> 1:17:45.097
character that you've created,

1:17:45.132 --> 1:17:47.869
Ballion, did you think
that she would fill it?

1:17:47.904 --> 1:17:51.774
Did you... did you think
that this job would fill it?

1:17:51.809 --> 1:17:54.271
You made a daughter
to fill the hole,

1:17:54.306 --> 1:17:56.405
but even that didn't work,

1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:00.409
because nothing will heal you.

1:18:02.083 --> 1:18:04.853
Nothing except him.

1:18:11.356 --> 1:18:13.257
Come to this room tonight.

1:18:14.997 --> 1:18:16.359
Ten o'clock.

1:18:18.902 --> 1:18:21.837
It's been 22 years.

1:18:21.872 --> 1:18:23.773
Maggie.

1:18:23.808 --> 1:18:25.742
Be with your son.

1:18:32.476 --> 1:18:33.750
Fine.

1:18:39.351 --> 1:18:40.856
Hey, boss.

1:18:43.861 --> 1:18:45.322
Hey.

1:18:45.357 --> 1:18:47.357
I... I just wanted
to say, I'm...

1:18:47.392 --> 1:18:49.557
I'm glad you're feeling better.

1:18:49.592 --> 1:18:51.163
Thank you.

1:18:53.035 --> 1:18:54.364
Tomorrow's my last day.

1:18:56.874 --> 1:18:59.567
You haven't seen
that guy again, have you?

1:18:59.602 --> 1:19:01.272
What?

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.077
You know, the asshole.

1:19:06.180 --> 1:19:08.081
Oh.

1:19:08.116 --> 1:19:11.953
-No.
-Good. You're very strong.

1:19:11.988 --> 1:19:13.416
Thanks.

1:19:16.190 --> 1:19:18.388
All right, see you tomorrow.

1:19:18.423 --> 1:19:20.390
I helped.

1:19:20.425 --> 1:19:22.029
Excuse me?

1:19:23.461 --> 1:19:25.395
I helped, right?

1:19:25.430 --> 1:19:30.037
I helped you with...
with things.

1:19:31.601 --> 1:19:33.007
Yeah.

1:19:34.571 --> 1:19:36.142
Of course.

1:19:37.211 --> 1:19:38.980
A lot of things.

1:19:42.150 --> 1:19:43.281
Good.

1:19:44.922 --> 1:19:47.054
I'll make sure
your letter is glowing.

1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:53.555
Abbie, if you're watching this,
it means...

1:20:08.077 --> 1:20:10.275
Abbie, smidge.

1:20:10.310 --> 1:20:11.947
If you're watching this,

1:20:11.982 --> 1:20:14.081
it means that
something went wrong.

1:20:16.316 --> 1:20:20.417
I... I wrote everything down
in a letter a long time ago.

1:20:20.452 --> 1:20:23.420
I hoped I'd never have
to give it to you.

1:20:23.455 --> 1:20:26.258
<i>It is what happened to me.</i>

1:20:26.293 --> 1:20:28.359
<i>Every word is true.</i>

1:20:28.394 --> 1:20:31.934
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.</i>

1:20:33.333 --> 1:20:36.169
<i>I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

1:20:37.667 --> 1:20:40.635
I thought that I
could make it all okay, but...

1:20:40.670 --> 1:20:43.572
I was unlucky in what happened.

1:20:45.444 --> 1:20:48.577
<i>But, Abbie, I was...</i>
<i>I was so lucky,</i>

1:20:48.612 --> 1:20:53.923
<i>so, so, so very lucky</i>
<i>to have you.</i>

1:20:57.291 --> 1:20:59.060
A million deaths

1:20:59.095 --> 1:21:02.690
would be worth the 18 years
that I spent with you.

1:21:02.725 --> 1:21:05.264
I love you.

1:21:05.299 --> 1:21:08.432
<i>I admire you.</i>

1:21:08.467 --> 1:21:12.139
<i>I hope that you understand</i>
<i>why I needed to do what I did.</i>

1:21:12.174 --> 1:21:14.537
<i>And if you don't...</i>

1:21:14.572 --> 1:21:16.308
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:21:16.343 --> 1:21:20.345
But I know that when you have
children of your own...

1:21:22.514 --> 1:21:25.350
you'll understand.

1:21:26.716 --> 1:21:28.386
<i>When you become a mother,</i>

1:21:28.421 --> 1:21:30.553
<i>your own life doesn't mean</i>
<i>so much anymore.</i>

1:21:34.361 --> 1:21:36.966
You become disposable.

1:21:39.432 --> 1:21:42.202
<i>Gloriously disposable.</i>

1:22:05.260 --> 1:22:06.655
Maggie.

1:22:06.690 --> 1:22:08.558
So glad you could come.

1:22:26.545 --> 1:22:28.776
You look wonderful.

1:22:28.811 --> 1:22:31.515
I tried to find
something elegant,

1:22:31.550 --> 1:22:32.747
but, you know...

1:22:32.782 --> 1:22:35.057
there's a view.

1:22:36.555 --> 1:22:38.555
And I got some wine.
Do you want a glass?

1:22:38.590 --> 1:22:40.722
-Where is it?
-Hmm?

1:22:40.757 --> 1:22:42.427
The gun, show it to me.

1:22:42.462 --> 1:22:43.791
It's in the river.

1:22:43.826 --> 1:22:45.727
No more of that now.

1:22:48.369 --> 1:22:51.304
I got you a little something.

1:22:51.339 --> 1:22:52.569
Here.

1:23:11.854 --> 1:23:13.623
I saved it for you.

1:23:25.241 --> 1:23:30.541
I remember you drawing it
when I first laid eyes on you,

1:23:30.576 --> 1:23:32.609
on the beach.

1:23:32.644 --> 1:23:35.678
Every morning,
there you'd be on that beach

1:23:35.713 --> 1:23:38.384
with your pad,
no matter the weather,

1:23:38.419 --> 1:23:42.487
working for hours
on that same drawing.

1:23:42.522 --> 1:23:45.226
You didn't know
but I was watching you.

1:23:45.261 --> 1:23:47.195
I knew.

1:23:47.230 --> 1:23:49.131
I always knew.

1:23:49.166 --> 1:23:51.298
Of course, you always
saw right through me.

1:23:51.333 --> 1:23:53.795
You just watched and watched.

1:23:53.830 --> 1:23:55.764
Never said anything.

1:23:55.799 --> 1:23:58.173
And then there you were
at our place,

1:23:58.208 --> 1:23:59.636
getting my parents shit-faced

1:23:59.671 --> 1:24:01.704
on that disgusting
homemade wine.

1:24:01.739 --> 1:24:04.608
-Oh, yeah.
-It was very clever
what you did.

1:24:04.643 --> 1:24:07.281
You knew exactly
what you wanted.

1:24:07.316 --> 1:24:09.844
Yeah. But so did you.

1:24:09.879 --> 1:24:11.780
I was a child.

1:24:11.815 --> 1:24:14.387
A stupid child.

1:24:14.422 --> 1:24:16.554
And you just kept coming
over and over.

1:24:16.589 --> 1:24:20.822
But then one night,
there you were, at my door,

1:24:20.857 --> 1:24:24.430
and within minutes,

1:24:24.465 --> 1:24:29.369
a world that had seemed
so cruel, so disordered,

1:24:29.404 --> 1:24:31.437
became...

1:24:31.472 --> 1:24:34.275
immaculate.

1:24:35.674 --> 1:24:38.576
Do you remember
how stunned we were

1:24:38.611 --> 1:24:41.348
when the sun came up
and we realized

1:24:41.383 --> 1:24:43.416
it had all been real?

1:24:43.451 --> 1:24:45.781
Of course I remember.

1:24:45.816 --> 1:24:50.621
That time,
the life we made was

1:24:50.656 --> 1:24:52.590
holy.

1:24:52.625 --> 1:24:54.526
It was perfect.

1:24:57.663 --> 1:25:01.500
God, Maggie,
I've missed you so much.

1:25:08.212 --> 1:25:09.838
It's too bright.

1:25:22.589 --> 1:25:24.754
We both missed you, Maggie.

1:25:28.958 --> 1:25:30.430
Yeah.

1:25:31.664 --> 1:25:33.268
He's awake.

1:25:33.303 --> 1:25:35.798
He's moving.

1:25:35.833 --> 1:25:37.503
Would you like to feel?

1:25:40.904 --> 1:25:42.442
Come here.

1:25:43.445 --> 1:25:44.708
It's okay.

1:25:54.918 --> 1:25:56.456
There.

1:25:56.491 --> 1:25:59.591
Feel the little hand
reaching out for you?

1:25:59.626 --> 1:26:01.230
Hmm?

1:26:06.633 --> 1:26:08.303
You wanna talk to him?

1:26:09.669 --> 1:26:11.240
Talk to him.

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:14.705
He can hear you.

1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:16.311
It's all right.

1:26:17.677 --> 1:26:19.644
Nothing will happen,
I promise.

1:26:25.685 --> 1:26:27.916
Ben?

1:26:27.951 --> 1:26:30.655
-Whoa, whoa.

1:26:30.690 --> 1:26:32.921
It's okay. It's okay.

1:26:34.331 --> 1:26:35.726
Yeah?

1:26:35.761 --> 1:26:37.827
He says hello.

1:26:37.862 --> 1:26:39.829
Put your hand right here.

1:26:41.767 --> 1:26:43.371
He needs you, Maggie.

1:26:44.572 --> 1:26:46.275
It's okay.

1:26:49.445 --> 1:26:51.808
Do you want to say hello?

1:26:51.843 --> 1:26:53.744
To your son?

1:26:53.779 --> 1:26:55.251
Hmm?

1:26:56.716 --> 1:26:58.551
Say hello to your boy.

1:27:02.557 --> 1:27:03.820
Hi...

1:27:06.022 --> 1:27:08.022
baby.

1:27:08.057 --> 1:27:09.892
My baby.

1:27:12.864 --> 1:27:14.699
Tell him how you feel.

1:27:16.604 --> 1:27:18.901
An-an-anything you want,
he's here.

1:27:22.104 --> 1:27:23.675
Ben.

1:27:25.580 --> 1:27:26.843
Ben, I...

1:27:28.814 --> 1:27:30.044
I'm sorry.

1:27:32.719 --> 1:27:34.884
I'm sorry for...

1:27:36.492 --> 1:27:38.492
for being a bad mom.

1:27:40.089 --> 1:27:41.726
It's all right.

1:27:41.761 --> 1:27:43.662
He forgives you.

1:27:43.697 --> 1:27:44.894
Maggie.

1:27:44.929 --> 1:27:46.467
No, no, no.

1:27:47.701 --> 1:27:49.635
You're forgiven.
You're forgiven.

1:27:49.670 --> 1:27:50.834
You're forgiven.

1:27:50.869 --> 1:27:53.606
-He loves you.

1:28:11.824 --> 1:28:12.955
No, no...

1:28:14.497 --> 1:28:15.859
No, no!

1:28:20.437 --> 1:28:21.568
Oh, David.

1:28:23.539 --> 1:28:25.440
David, he's alive?

1:28:27.103 --> 1:28:29.972
My son is alive.

1:28:30.007 --> 1:28:33.415
He is, yes. He's...

1:28:33.450 --> 1:28:34.878
He's inside you?

1:28:34.913 --> 1:28:36.077
Yes.

1:28:38.983 --> 1:28:40.752
-Suffering.
-No, no, no.

1:28:40.787 --> 1:28:42.985
He's happy now.
He's happy now. You're here.

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:44.624
He knows that you love him.

1:28:44.659 --> 1:28:46.725
-He needs to be fed.
-No.

1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:48.727
-He needs to be held.
-No.

1:28:48.762 --> 1:28:51.400
-He needs his mother.
-He has his mother.

1:28:51.435 --> 1:28:52.929
You're right here with him.

1:28:58.574 --> 1:29:01.036
You just... you need to relax.

1:29:01.071 --> 1:29:02.774
-I failed him.
-No.

1:29:02.809 --> 1:29:05.040
No, he loves you.

1:29:05.075 --> 1:29:08.109
I left him,
and you put him inside.

1:29:08.144 --> 1:29:10.144
I had no choice,
you know that.

1:29:10.179 --> 1:29:12.850
But I brought him back
here to you.

1:29:14.689 --> 1:29:15.919
Thank you.

1:29:15.954 --> 1:29:18.152
Thank you for bringing him back.

1:29:19.595 --> 1:29:21.958
I have him now.

1:29:21.993 --> 1:29:23.696
And he has me.

1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:27.029
And I think...

1:29:29.935 --> 1:29:32.771
I think that we don't
need you anymore.

1:29:35.644 --> 1:29:37.446
What are you doing?
Maggie. Maggie.

1:29:37.481 --> 1:29:40.207
Just... come and sit
and we'll talk.

1:29:40.242 --> 1:29:43.650
I will do anything
for my children.

1:29:46.523 --> 1:29:48.116
Shit!

1:29:51.759 --> 1:29:52.890
Ah...

1:29:52.925 --> 1:29:54.595
Maggie.

1:29:55.994 --> 1:29:57.664
You need to calm down.

1:29:57.699 --> 1:30:01.569
Baby's crying. He doesn't
like that we're arguing.

1:30:01.604 --> 1:30:03.098
No, no, please!

1:30:03.133 --> 1:30:05.100
Let's just talk,
let's just talk.

1:30:16.586 --> 1:30:19.917
Don't move or I'll stab you
in the fucking neck.

1:30:31.194 --> 1:30:32.699
Why?!

1:30:32.734 --> 1:30:34.536
Why did you do that?

1:30:35.704 --> 1:30:37.704
I can't fathom this.

1:30:37.739 --> 1:30:39.904
I came to you
with the greatest gift,

1:30:39.939 --> 1:30:42.137
and this is what you do.

1:30:42.172 --> 1:30:45.745
Without me, there is no him.
Can't you see that?

1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:48.583
We're one, and we love you!

1:30:50.246 --> 1:30:52.246
Stop that, Maggie!

1:30:52.281 --> 1:30:54.182
Just... no more.

1:30:54.217 --> 1:30:56.822
Just stay where you are!

1:31:03.897 --> 1:31:05.732
Drop it! Just...

1:31:05.767 --> 1:31:08.229
Just drop it! Yaaah!

1:31:29.923 --> 1:31:31.285
No, Maggie.

1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:32.990
Please, no more.

1:31:36.028 --> 1:31:37.665
No more, Maggie.

1:31:39.702 --> 1:31:41.900
We need to go to a hospital.

1:31:41.935 --> 1:31:44.100
Together, we can do it.

1:31:44.135 --> 1:31:46.773
We can... fix this.

1:31:46.808 --> 1:31:48.808
We can fix this, Maggie.

1:31:57.819 --> 1:32:00.281
Oh, God, someone's hurt you.

1:32:01.383 --> 1:32:03.691
But I'll save you.

1:32:03.726 --> 1:32:05.154
I'll save you.

1:32:08.731 --> 1:32:10.863
We can be family.

1:32:47.198 --> 1:32:48.835
No. No, Maggie, please.

1:32:48.870 --> 1:32:50.034
Don't.

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:53.037
You're killing him.

1:32:55.437 --> 1:32:57.173
You're murdering your own son.

1:32:59.210 --> 1:33:02.981
God, it stinks!
It stinks in here!

1:33:05.282 --> 1:33:08.151
He was wrong, yes, so wrong.

1:33:10.089 --> 1:33:11.990
You're a terrible mother.

1:33:13.730 --> 1:33:17.699
I am a good mother.

1:33:19.428 --> 1:33:21.802
You're a murderer.

1:33:25.170 --> 1:33:28.072
You kill me, you kill him.

1:33:28.107 --> 1:33:30.877
Then I'll have to do it
while you're alive.

1:33:39.723 --> 1:33:41.316
Don't do it, Maggie.

1:33:41.351 --> 1:33:43.219
Please, please don't do it.

1:33:43.254 --> 1:33:45.353
Don't do it, Maggie.

1:33:47.489 --> 1:33:49.357
Don't do it, Maggie.
Don't do it.

1:33:49.392 --> 1:33:51.799
Don't do it, don't.
Don't, Maggie, don't do it.

1:33:51.834 --> 1:33:52.932
Don't do it!

1:33:52.967 --> 1:33:54.428
Please don't do it!

1:33:54.463 --> 1:33:56.705
-Arggh!

1:33:59.171 --> 1:34:01.369
It's not my fault.

1:34:02.438 --> 1:34:04.713
I just did what you wanted.

1:34:06.277 --> 1:34:07.683
I would have done anything.

1:34:09.049 --> 1:34:11.951
I came back, I came back.

1:34:17.959 --> 1:34:20.091
Because I see you,
Maggie.

1:34:21.226 --> 1:34:22.764
I see you.

1:34:28.299 --> 1:34:29.837
I see you.

1:35:45.013 --> 1:35:46.078
Hey.

1:35:49.919 --> 1:35:51.314
Hey, you.

1:36:07.530 --> 1:36:09.530
It's good to see you again.

1:36:16.374 --> 1:36:17.945
I saved you.

1:36:37.395 --> 1:36:39.032
I saved you.

1:36:40.233 --> 1:36:41.595
I saved you.

1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:53.442
Oh, shh, shh, shh!

1:36:53.477 --> 1:36:56.445
Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:58.249
Oh!

1:37:41.195 --> 1:37:42.293
I'm all packed.

1:37:47.333 --> 1:37:49.135
You want to hold him?

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.536
Okay.

1:37:56.639 --> 1:37:58.980
Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

1:37:59.015 --> 1:38:00.212
You got the head?

1:38:00.247 --> 1:38:01.576
There you go.

1:38:03.283 --> 1:38:05.250
Shh, shh, shh!

1:38:18.661 --> 1:38:20.001
Thanks, Mom.

1:38:27.769 --> 1:38:30.077
Hey, little fat-ass.

1:38:30.112 --> 1:38:31.980
Hey, you.

1:38:33.709 --> 1:38:35.346
Shh!

1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:38.052
Abbie-pooh.

1:38:38.087 --> 1:38:39.713
And the claw!

1:38:39.748 --> 1:38:42.386
The claw!

1:38:43.455 --> 1:38:45.026
Mom.

1:38:45.061 --> 1:38:48.128
What? What is it?

1:38:53.564 --> 1:38:58.171
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not scared anymore.

1:39:01.374 --> 1:39:03.110
You made everything okay.

1:39:04.707 --> 1:39:06.443
So I'm not scared.

1:39:11.450 --> 1:39:12.713
Oh, shh!

1:39:12.748 --> 1:39:15.518
It's okay, huh?

1:39:15.553 --> 1:39:18.422
It's okay.

1:39:18.457 --> 1:39:20.259
It's okay.
