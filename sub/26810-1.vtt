01:13.307 --> 01:17.211
- Angelina Foxworth,
what can I do for you?

01:18.846 --> 01:21.548
- Well, I'm tired
of being in limbo,

01:21.549 --> 01:23.983
and I wanna go home back
to Earth for the holiday.

01:23.984 --> 01:24.984
I miss my family.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.154
- Hm, interesting.

01:28.322 --> 01:32.192
How about some caviar, some
oysters, some champagne,

01:32.193 --> 01:34.127
maybe a yacht thrown
into that list too, huh?

01:34.128 --> 01:35.362
How would that be?

01:35.363 --> 01:37.830
- Actually, that
sounds pretty good.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.099
- Apparently you're not
really qualified for much

01:40.100 --> 01:42.869
of anything right now, least
of all another Earth visit.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.104
I heard somewhere
that you violated

01:45.105 --> 01:48.941
several major rules
last time, hm?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.743
Based on that I can't
really help you, I'm sorry.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.579
- Oh, God.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.382
- Who used my name in vain?

01:56.384 --> 02:01.421
- Angelina Foxworth, 9021080...

02:01.422 --> 02:04.657
- You may never use my
name in vain again.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.859
- Yes, sir.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.740
- Place her on probation
and do the right thing.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.132
- Probation?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.901
- Look on the bright side.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.036
At least you get to go back to
Earth and see your family for

02:17.037 --> 02:20.708
the holidays, but you must
make a very significant change

02:22.142 --> 02:24.511
in your family, but
please remember

02:24.512 --> 02:27.980
what I'm about to tell you now.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.318
This is your last
opportunity to leave limbo.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.820
Please don't disregard it.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.623
If you do you will go back
into limbo and you will never

02:36.624 --> 02:39.459
have a chance to see
your family every again.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.394
Are we clear on all these
points that I brought up?

02:40.395 --> 02:41.661
Are we clear?

02:41.662 --> 02:42.396
- Hell yes.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.364
- Excuse me?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.298
- Heck yes.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.298
- That's better.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.735
You have yourself a
very merry Christmas.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.769
- Thank you.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.770
You too.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.141
- Don't forget to keep
that scarf on you.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.310
- I won't.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.766
- This tree is so beautiful.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.468
We've only been
here for six months

04:28.469 --> 04:29.969
and it already feels like home.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.705
- Yes, but the mansion
was way bigger.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.308
I mean, I can't even fit my
usual size Douglas fir here.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.009
- Honey, it's the holidays.

04:37.010 --> 04:37.978
Be happy.

04:37.979 --> 04:40.046
Lucille, Raven.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.581
- Leave it, James.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.815
She'd just be sitting here
on her phone anyways.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.984
- Give her a break, she's 16.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.986
- Here, I found some
more old ornaments.

04:46.987 --> 04:47.987
- Thank you, Lucille.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.024
- Aunt Maggie?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.660
- She has a bakery
on the east side.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.462
- I remember you
telling me about her.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.696
- I heard she's not
doing that well though.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.665
- Too much sugar
will do that to you.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.633
- I think we should
pay her a visit.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.154
- You and Raven should
pay her a visit.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.405
- Dad?

05:04.405 --> 05:05.405
- We're in here.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.141
Raven, do you remember
your Aunt Maggie?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.345
- You mean Auntie Coocoo?

05:12.346 --> 05:14.381
Yeah, she's been sending
me Christmas books

05:14.382 --> 05:16.516
every Christmas
since I was nine.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.519
- If you don't want
them, I'll take them.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.120
- Your dad thinks he
should go visit her.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.490
- Well, nevermind about that.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.791
Why are you both out of breath?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.158
- There was a major pipe break

05:26.159 --> 05:27.326
across the street from
the soup kitchen.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.128
- Was there any damages?

05:29.129 --> 05:31.731
- No, not on the inside,
but the city said

05:31.732 --> 05:34.133
it could take up to two
weeks to repair the pipe.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.102
- And meanwhile, the
soup kitchen's closed.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.470
- Well that's too
bad with Christmas

05:37.471 --> 05:39.271
right around the corner.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.273
- Deacon Scott is hopeless.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.175
Dad, you have to do something.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.911
- I'm sorry honey, but
pushing the water department

05:44.912 --> 05:47.113
to fix a leak
during the holidays

05:47.114 --> 05:49.148
is a little bit out of the
realm of what I can do.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.483
- Dad, really?

05:50.484 --> 05:53.052
You know the mayor.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.754
- I know the mayor, but
he's a very busy gentleman.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.755
- I bet if Mom was
here she could

05:55.756 --> 05:57.036
certainly do something about it.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.359
- Raven dear, your
father's right.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.194
Something like this unfortunately
is out of his hands.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.764
- Raven, I was thinking,

06:04.765 --> 06:05.965
how do you feel about helping
your Great Aunt Maggie?

06:05.966 --> 06:06.966
- What?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.803
No, go to the mountains?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.071
- She doesn't live
in the mountains.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.040
We just visited the one
Christmas in Big Bear.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.442
She has a bakery
on the east side.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.410
- No, I'm not going there.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.546
- Excuse us, you're going.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.847
- I am not going anywhere.

06:20.848 --> 06:21.848
- Raven.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.952
- I am made as hell and I'm
not gonna take this anymore.

06:25.953 --> 06:26.953
Come on, Jerry.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.857
- What was that?

06:30.858 --> 06:32.859
I mean, are you okay with that?

06:32.860 --> 06:33.661
'Cause I'm not.

06:33.662 --> 06:34.961
- Don't worry, darling.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.763
It's a classic quote
from the movie network.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.631
- So, if I get married
and start dancing

06:38.632 --> 06:40.867
in the fountain that's okay,
because I'm just quoting.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.736
Fellini's la dolce vita scene
in the Trevi Fountain, right?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.705
- I think that would
be kinda funny.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.405
- I think we should
find her something

06:45.406 --> 06:47.507
else to do for the holidays.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.575
- I agree with you.
- I just don't want

06:48.576 --> 06:50.810
the neighbors to hear
all that screaming.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.745
- They won't hear us,
just live a little.

06:51.746 --> 06:53.345
- Enough of this nonsense.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.315
- Listen, I organized a
reunion with Aunt Maggie,

06:56.316 --> 06:57.650
don't worry, I have a plan set.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.651
- You better.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.188
- Oh my, look what time it is.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.623
I have an appointment at
the Chamber of Commerce.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.757
Okay, sweetheart, love you.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.793
- Love you.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.096
- Molly's really starting
to get on my nerves.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.799
- She's just trying
to be your mom.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.067
- No she's not, she's just
trying to get rid of me.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.202
- You think?

07:16.203 --> 07:17.443
- I don't wanna talk about her.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.940
- So, why don't you tell
me more about Aunt Cookie?

07:23.343 --> 07:24.343
- Aunt Maggie.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.881
I don't know, her and my
mom were best friends,

07:28.882 --> 07:30.882
then all of a sudden they
just didn't talk anymore.

07:32.419 --> 07:36.856
- Well, you know I haven't
seen snow in quite some time,

07:36.857 --> 07:38.424
I could turn it into a little
vacation for you and I.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.425
- Nope.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.597
Bunny, do you wanna
go see Aunt Maggie?

07:47.034 --> 07:50.870
Don't bark if you wanna
go see Aunt Maggie.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.339
- Looks like he wants us
to go see Aunt Maggie.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.980
- Do you wanna stay
here and play instead?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.137
- At least somebody
agrees with me.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.253
- Yeah, I agree, we should look

08:07.254 --> 08:08.894
at the easements on
both those properties.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.791
- Well, we'll have the
opportunity of presenting

08:11.792 --> 08:13.926
our plans at next week's
city commission meeting.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.062
- I'm not sure the
city of Beverly Hills

08:16.063 --> 08:17.530
needs more mixed-used
development.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.799
- Wait, what?

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
I can't believe you'd be
opposed to this, James.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.834
- It's not that I'm
opposed it it...

08:21.835 --> 08:23.102
- Then what is it?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.004
I mean, it's the
wave of the future.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.206
- I live for days just
like this, fellas.

08:27.207 --> 08:27.608
That's why we got
into the business.

08:27.609 --> 08:29.041
- That's right.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.943
- Did you see the
expression on her face?

08:30.944 --> 08:34.547
- The expression of I just lost
seven figures to these guys.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.815
Woo! - I'll be dreaming

08:35.816 --> 08:36.849
about it tonight.
- Dreaming, that's my queue.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.184
- What?
- Yeah, I'm tired.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.153
And you guys are celebrating
and talking business

08:41.154 --> 08:42.755
and I want you to be able to
do that and I feel like...

08:42.756 --> 08:43.789
- It's the biggest deal
in the firms history.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.791
One last cheers before you go?

08:44.792 --> 08:45.792
- Yeah.
- One cheers.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.127
To you guys.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.848
No, you guys deserve it,
honestly, congrats.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.633
Okay, my Uber's here.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.603
- Okay.
- Love you forever.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.604
- Love you forever.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.740
- Okay guys, have fun.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.642
- Thank you.
- Don't be too naughty.

09:01.643 --> 09:03.003
- Lucille will see
you to the door.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.778
Nathan, you're one lucky guy.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.513
- You are lucky.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.615
You're lucky and
we're rich, fellas.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.549
What a great day.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.319
What a great day,
ready to go again?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.988
- Let's review the
other proposals first.

09:15.989 --> 09:16.989
- Oh, I agree with James.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.625
- Welcome back to Earth, Nate.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.395
- Perry, can you get
me Betford file?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.798
- Sure, I'll get right on that.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.601
Nate, do you have a minute?

09:28.602 --> 09:29.602
- Yeah.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.605
- What's up, buddy?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.127
- Oh, look I'm sorry I just,

09:37.210 --> 09:38.810
I just haven't been
in the game, I guess.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.282
- It's about Laura, right?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.003
- Yeah, I should've been
driving that night.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.756
- Nate, it's not your fault.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.837
None of this is your fault.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.299
She would want you to be happy.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.633
- I just wish I could
see her again.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.002
- I know the feeling.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.604
It's been several years
since I lost my first wife,

10:05.605 --> 10:09.276
and not a day goes by that I
don't wish she was with me.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.682
- I see her in the light.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.889
I miss her smile,
I miss her laugh.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.846
- Look, let's go
look at the plans.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.623
- Hey, hey...

10:57.624 --> 10:58.758
- What the heck.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.659
- Have you seen my reindeer?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.560
- No.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.630
- I can't find them and Santa
doesn't like it when I'm late.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.865
- How can you see me?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.867
- I'm an elf, duh.

11:07.868 --> 11:08.902
I can see you.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.531
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.744
- How does Nathan feel?

11:19.980 --> 11:22.381
- Not so good, he feels guilty.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.350
- Enough with the pity party,
he needs to move on already.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.484
- Aren't you being a bit harsh?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.353
He lot his wife.

11:26.354 --> 11:27.586
- Mrs. Foxworth.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.587
- Yes?

11:30.623 --> 11:33.192
Lucille?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.728
- I'm sorry, I
think I heard your

11:35.729 --> 11:37.997
cell phone ringing in the
other room, Mrs. Foxworth.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.299
- Okay, let me go check.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.341
- Lucille can you remind me
of my schedule tomorrow with

11:49.342 --> 11:51.643
the Chamber of Commerce
in Beverly Hills

11:51.644 --> 11:53.345
and my medical appointment

11:53.346 --> 11:57.817
and also do I have that
meeting over at BucksBees?

11:57.818 --> 12:01.353
- And since when I was
promoted to a secretary?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.623
I thought I was just
a housekeeper here?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.007
- Yvonne is here.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.543
- Ding dong the witch is here.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.512
- Ding dong the witch is here.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.014
- I heard you, Uncle James.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.916
- I wasn't trying to whisper.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.417
- That's nice.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.952
- So, give me the
bad news first.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.320
- No bad news, I just came by

12:34.321 --> 12:36.856
to take Aunt Molly
Christmas shopping.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.458
- So then I should block
all my credit cards?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.627
Once again, how did you get
that new Bentley outside?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.595
- I got it at a charity auction.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.596
- A charity auction.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.200
- Yvonne.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.569
- Hey, how's my favorite cousin?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.404
Busy?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.306
- Yeah, I'm just trying to buy
something on Net-a-Porter,

12:54.307 --> 12:56.943
but it won't let me, my credit
card number won't work.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.878
- You mean my
credit card number?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.612
So, what are you
buying now, Raven?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.493
A new FREDDY yacht for
your trip to South Beach?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.951
- Just doing some early
holiday shopping.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.067
Christmas is in a few days.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.523
Let me guess, you
haven't even started

13:11.524 --> 13:12.524
Christmas shopping yet?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.725
- Ah, James.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.061
- And what's wrong with that?

13:15.062 --> 13:17.729
- Every year you spend panicking
up and down Rodeo just

13:17.730 --> 13:19.331
to buy Molly another
useless piece of jewelry.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.933
Surprise her.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.035
Send her to a retreat in Mexico.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.370
- I beg your pardon, Raven?

13:24.371 --> 13:25.972
- Duh.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.706
- Raven, I always buy
everyone's gifts first.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.341
- Lies.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.410
- Pardon me?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.780
- What is it?

13:34.781 --> 13:35.781
- Hi, Aunt Molly.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.683
- Thanks for coming.

13:36.683 --> 13:37.584
How's your boyfriend.

13:37.585 --> 13:38.784
- Ugh, I got rid of him.

13:38.785 --> 13:39.986
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.487
- I'm not.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.089
- So, what's everybody
talking about?

13:43.090 --> 13:44.490
- Nothing that concerns you.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.892
- About life.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.194
- Yeah, life sucks
and then you die.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.229
- Raven, please behave.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.332
- I really don't know what to
get my nieces and nephews.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.067
- Maybe because you
never see them.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.435
- Maybe because I
work hard everyday.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.436
- Saint Molly.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.508
- Raven, since we have you
here, we decided that you're

14:02.509 --> 14:03.943
gonna visit your Aunt
Maggie for the holiday.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.411
- I'm what?

14:05.412 --> 14:06.079
- You're going to
visit with your Aunt.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.980
- For my entire break?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.081
- Lucille will be
packing your bag.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.083
- I can pack my own case.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.618
Is this a joke? - No joke?

14:12.619 --> 14:15.187
- What about Jerry?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.389
- They'll appreciate
another set of hands.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.870
Get ready, you're
leaving in one hour.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.592
- No.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.629
- She okay?

14:23.630 --> 14:24.897
- Oh, she'll live.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.598
The girl needs a
kick in the butt.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.639
Come on, Yvonne, let's go.

14:39.246 --> 14:43.315

14:44.651 --> 14:47.454

14:50.423 --> 14:51.423
I hate it here.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.693
I miss you so much.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.965
- Love, life is beautiful.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.669
I want you to go see my sister.

- Really?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.740
Mom?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.287
- That is absolutely beautiful.

15:55.288 --> 15:55.922
- Yeah, they are.
- Look at these.

15:55.923 --> 15:57.523
Aren't they pretty?

15:57.524 --> 15:58.524
They turned out really well.
- They did.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.226
- Maggie.

16:00.227 --> 16:03.062
- Oh, not Kevin, I
told you last week

16:03.063 --> 16:04.797
that I will call you
when I am ready to pay.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.001
- I'm afraid it's a bit more
complicated than that, Maggie.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.171
- But, look Kevin, I have been
in this shop for 30 years.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.141
I am an institution
in this town.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.308
- Well, I guess the
collectors don't like

16:16.309 --> 16:17.443
your sugar cookies
anymore, Maggie.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.211
- What?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.412
- I have a bitter one for you.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.949
You have one week left,

16:23.950 --> 16:26.352
which means your deadline's
the day after Christmas.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.020
So you better start collecting
your money or you can start

16:28.021 --> 16:29.555
selling cookies off a van in
Griffith Park for all I care.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.556
- How dare you.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.859
- The day after
Christmas, Maggie.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.980
- Don't you dare walk out...

16:36.496 --> 16:37.397
- Maggie?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.397
Maggie, are you okay?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.367
- Oh, I'm fine.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.302
- You don't look fine.

16:42.303 --> 16:43.935
- Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.737
Um, I tell ya what, Doll,

16:45.738 --> 16:47.273
go outside to see who's
there, why don't you?

16:47.274 --> 16:48.274
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

17:08.027 --> 17:12.098
- Right this way.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.169
- Aunt Maggie.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.450
- Well, this is a
great surprise.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.339
Just look at y'all.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.876
Oh, my goodness James,
it's just giving me

17:24.877 --> 17:26.178
the chills to see y'all here.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.779
- It's been a very long time.

17:27.780 --> 17:28.814
How have you been?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.382
- I couldn't be better.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.452
I couldn't be better.

17:33.453 --> 17:37.756
Oh, my goodness, I would
know this child anywhere.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.126
There's a very big
family resemblance.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.127
- Hi, Aunt Maggie.
- Hi.

17:43.663 --> 17:47.299
So, to what do I owe
this pleasant surprise?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.368
- First, we'd like to
place a family order.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.137
- What are y'all gonna have?

17:50.138 --> 17:52.139
Whoa, all this, huh?

17:54.474 --> 17:57.343
- You know how the Foxworths
love to entertain.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.278
- I am thankin' the
Lord for that.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.714
This is gonna keep
me mighty busy.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.275
- Not to worry, I
brought you some help.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.952
- Oh, really?

18:06.953 --> 18:08.354
- Ready for duty.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.490
- Well, that would be great.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.860
We have an event
up in Crows Roost

18:14.861 --> 18:18.029
and to have some extra help
would really be great.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.165
- Crows Roost?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.932
Like in the Big Bear Mountains?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.334
- Yes, that's the one.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.069
It's lovely up there.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.938
- Raven, it's gonna be fine.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.574
Aunt Maggie, thank you
for taking care of her.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.910
- Well, it is my
pleasure to do so.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.979
Well, come on in, y'all.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.781
Come on in to the shop and
take a look at the place.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.782
Come on in.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.290
- Hey.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.057
- Hey, do you mind if I sit.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.058
- Oh, not at all.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.199
What's your name?
- Raven, what's yours?

18:53.200 --> 18:53.966
- Nice to meet you, Raven.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.867
I'm Nina.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.769
- So how long have
you been baking?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.906
- Uh, I've been baking
for a few years now.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.574
Yeah, it's been really
great working for Maggie.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.809
- Yeah, she's pretty cool.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.077
- Yeah.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.438
Do you have any
interest in baking?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.550
- Yeah, my Mom loved baking.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.791
- Oh, does your mom still bake?

19:13.986 --> 19:17.323
- No, she died.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.125
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.126
- It's okay.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.465
- I could teach you how to bake.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.533
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.335
- That'd be great, sure.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.869
- All right, let's go for it.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.272
Let's five.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.275
Do you wanna start
with pies or cookies.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.309
- Cookies, they're my favorite.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.778
- Yeah, they're
so much more fun.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.922
- Thanks for helping
with this, Yvonne.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.158
I can't believe how hard
it is to shop for James.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.227
- Have you tried Stefano Ricci?

19:55.228 --> 19:57.329
- I did, but then I realized
I needed him there with me.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.366
- Oh, what is Raven getting him?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.334
- Who knows, the
girl doesn't think

20:01.335 --> 20:02.375
about anybody but herself.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.837
Do you think I'm being
too harsh with her?

20:05.838 --> 20:08.139
- Yeah, I think you are.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.842
That girl has been through a
lot, she just lost her mom.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.044
- You're right, I need
to bond with her more.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.914
I just wanted to spend
more times with James.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.916
- What about if you guys planned
a trip together somewhere?

20:17.917 --> 20:18.718
- That's a great idea.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.619
We haven't traveled for a while.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.789
Maybe Dubai or Paris.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.925
Maybe something simple like
a road trip up the coast.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.660
- That's good.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.796
- Oh, no, that's not a good
idea because that gets me one

20:30.797 --> 20:33.078
step closer to sleeping under
the stars in a sleeping bag.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.467
Can you imagine us cooking
chow under the fire?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.769
- No, I cannot.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.373
What about if you drive up
to Joshua Tree and camp?

20:41.808 --> 20:42.808
- Camping?

20:44.043 --> 20:45.312
No, you've lost your mind.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.709
- Wow.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.012
We're here.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.315
Welcome to the
mountain, city girl.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.750
- It's freezing.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.218
- Oh, see I'm glad
it's not just me.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.588
Okay kids, I tell you what,

21:29.589 --> 21:33.725
why don't you all
help unload the car?

21:33.726 --> 21:35.494
There you go, see that'll
warm you right up.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.495
- Great.
- This way.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.412
Here we are.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.413
Careful.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.517
Whoops, here we go.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.222
Ah.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.694
Kids, I tell you what, why
don't you leave your boxes out

22:08.695 --> 22:10.195
here and we can just
get them later, okay?

22:10.196 --> 22:10.830
- Okay.
- All right.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.830
- Perfect.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.135
Oh, my goodness.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.306
Well kids, welcome to Apples.

22:21.307 --> 22:22.307
Isn't it beautiful?

22:23.776 --> 22:24.976
I love it, it's so Christmasy.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.014
I tell you what, y'all
sit down, you rest,

22:29.015 --> 22:29.882
I'm gonna go check
in and I'm gonna

22:29.883 --> 22:31.216
get y'all some hot
chocolate, okay?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.297
- Okay, Aunt Maggie.
- Okay.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.862
- Hey, so thanks
for coming with me

22:43.863 --> 22:45.296
and always being there for me.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.932
- Yeah, of course.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.093
I mean, you know I like you,
so I'd do anything for ya.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.357
- This might sound
a little weird,

22:54.140 --> 22:56.274
but you know how when
you died and came back?

22:56.275 --> 22:57.275
- Mm hm.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.958
- Recharging.
- Recharging, charged.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.359
- Jerry, don't you
give up on me.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.194
One more time, Jerry.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.194
Come on, come on, clear.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.081
- I feel like my mom came
back with you or in you.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.087
- Well, I mean I guess souls
don't really have a gender.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.290
But, I get what you mean.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
- I love you.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.964
- I love me, too.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.369
I do love you, though.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.572
Just so you know.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.699
- Come on, whoa!

24:40.279 --> 24:42.013
- I think he's cuter that you.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.254
- I mean, honestly, our scarves
are pretty much the same.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.118
- Take it off this for me.
- Okay.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.119
- Just take it.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.023
- Get, ah no, it's
caught in the back.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.491
Oh, it's stapled in the back.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.527
Crap, go, go.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.108
- Face first, is a
whole lot easier.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.460
About that height, it just
goes a little bit longer.

25:26.425 --> 25:28.059
You get to show them, right?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.060
- Keep warm.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.763
Did you see that?

25:31.764 --> 25:34.265
The old 97s are comin' to town.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.333
- We should go see them.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.935
- Maybe.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.670
We should go see The Bad Seeds.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.706
That would be a good one, right?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.041
Look at what I got you.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.010
- It's so...

25:45.011 --> 25:46.778
- No, that's for
Christmas, though.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.779
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.880
It's for, look I'll
let you look at it,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.381
but it's for
Christmas, all right?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.850
- It's so cute.
- I know.

25:51.851 --> 25:52.851
That's why I got it.

26:27.787 --> 26:28.187
- Aren't those beautiful, honey?

26:28.188 --> 26:30.021
- Yes.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.122
- I know, I made that apple
crumble just for you,

26:31.123 --> 26:31.958
'cause I know it
is your favorite.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.158
- It's gonna be so good.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.793
- I know, I love it,
I love it, too.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.063
Well hey there, Lenoir, how
you doin' this morning?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.464
- I'm just okay, it's
'cause of the arthritis.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.565
- Oh no.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.668
- All the baking
I've been doing,

26:42.669 --> 26:43.636
but I see you made
fruit tarts today.

26:43.637 --> 26:45.637
- You know, I sure did.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.772
There was a beautiful
crop of apples

26:46.773 --> 26:47.973
I had to take advantage of it.

26:49.876 --> 26:50.743
Well, I tell you what,
try yourself a sample.

26:50.744 --> 26:52.210
- All right?
- All right.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.531
You just go right
ahead, go ahead.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.649
What do you think?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.417
- Mm, what's in your crust?

26:59.418 --> 27:01.252
- Oh, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.688
- Mm hm.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.089
- I tell you what,

27:04.090 --> 27:05.156
why don't I give you a
copy of the recipe.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.058
- That would be fabulous.

27:07.059 --> 27:09.160
- Absolutely, you know what,
I've got it right here.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.029
Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.164
- Oh, you are so welcome
and you make sure

27:13.165 --> 27:14.532
to tell me how those turn
out when you make 'em.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.234
- I will.
- Okay.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.395
- Thanks.
- Your welcome, bye.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.637
I am good.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.875
Jerry, sweetheart,
could you lay off

27:23.876 --> 27:25.010
the snowballs for a little bit?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.878
Just leave us some snow.

27:26.879 --> 27:27.879
- All right.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.541
This is great, isn't it?

27:56.542 --> 27:59.144
This place it kinda reminds
me of Aspen a bit.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.412
- When were you in Aspen?

28:01.413 --> 28:02.981
- Never, but I mean
you don't have

28:02.982 --> 28:04.462
to go to Aspen to
know what it's like.

28:05.251 --> 28:05.885
- It's freezing.

28:05.886 --> 28:07.585
- Are you okay?

28:07.586 --> 28:10.555
You seem a little strange.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.490
- I'm okay, it's just cold.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.492
- Gotcha.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.728
Well, you wanna know my trick?

28:16.729 --> 28:18.196
I pretend that I'm in Miami...

28:18.197 --> 28:19.799
- Wait, when were you in Miami?

28:21.801 --> 28:24.102
- Never, but I mean
you don't have go...

28:24.103 --> 28:25.336
- To go to Miami to
know what it's like.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.405
- Bingo, you got it.
- Right, got it.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.406
- Come on, let's go.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.514
- See, I made this one for you.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.783
Got cream coconut 'cause I
know it's your favorite,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.084
you were in my head.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.118
Oh hey, there you are. - Thanks.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.686
- Hey.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.054
- Good to see that you didn't

28:43.055 --> 28:45.556
get lost in this
booming metropolis.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.858
- Oh no, not at all.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.760
This one here, she
is smart and pretty.

28:48.761 --> 28:49.895
Just like her mother.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.229
- Her mother?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.298
- Angelina.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.134
- Oh, we were good
friends with your mom.

28:56.769 --> 28:57.936
Herb Bessa.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.037
- Raven Foxworth.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.407
- So why haven't we met before?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.142
- My parents are probably too
busy with their own careers.

29:04.143 --> 29:09.114
- Oh, you know in an avalanche,
each unique and beautiful

29:09.115 --> 29:12.785
snowflake pleads not guilty
and I'll accept that answer.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.788
My oldest son lives
three blocks from here

29:16.789 --> 29:18.623
and I haven't seen
him in two months.

29:18.624 --> 29:20.558
- Well that's a darn shame.

29:20.559 --> 29:24.363
- Yeah, but I get to see
pictures from Hawaii, right?

29:26.432 --> 29:30.102
And the grandkids, they send me
sporting events on Facebook.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.570
- You're on Facebook?

29:32.571 --> 29:36.142
- To tell you the truth, Raven,
these wrinkles on my face,

29:38.577 --> 29:39.657
this is a mask I'm wearing.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.548
I'm only 55.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.750
- Aunt Maggie, you
should join Facebook.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.185
- Oh, honey, what on Earth for?

29:47.186 --> 29:48.686
I don't even have a computer.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.355
- You have one at the bakery
and to keep in touch.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.223
- You give me a call
or you stop by,

29:52.224 --> 29:53.925
that is how you stay in touch.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.126
- Hey you guys, you know what,

29:55.127 --> 29:57.195
I'm gonna go unload the
last load, all right?

29:57.196 --> 29:58.696
- Well thank you, sir.
- Yeah, you know, on that note

29:58.697 --> 30:02.667
I'm gonna go home and raise
my cholesterol levels.

30:02.668 --> 30:03.935
- All right.

30:03.936 --> 30:04.837
- Bye sweetie.

30:04.837 --> 30:05.837
- By Uncle Herb.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.107
- I like this girl.
- I do too.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.641
And I'll see you
next week, Herb.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.911
- Next week?

30:12.912 --> 30:14.612
Honey, I'll see you
in my dreams, love.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.214
- Aw, thank you.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.748
- Bye sweetie.

30:17.749 --> 30:18.884
- Bye Herb, drive safe.
- Bye.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.119
- Bye.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.855
That man was really
almost your uncle.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.390
- Really?

30:25.391 --> 30:27.025
- Oh yeah, he wanted
to put buns in my oven

30:27.026 --> 30:31.297
and I only wanted to bake pies.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.166
You know what, I'll tell you
what, it's lovely out here.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.834
I want you to go
find your sweetie

30:36.835 --> 30:37.869
and I want you to
go take a walk.

30:37.870 --> 30:38.770
- Seriously?

30:38.771 --> 30:39.871
- Yes, really.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.672
I can take of this, I got this.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.541
You go, you go have a good time.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.676
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.860
- Dad!

31:17.109 --> 31:18.944
- Are you all right,
are you all right?

31:18.945 --> 31:20.111
- Actually I think I've fallen

31:20.112 --> 31:22.147
for you quite literally
in this way.

31:22.148 --> 31:22.949
- Don't hurt yourself.

31:22.949 --> 31:23.949
- All right.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.089
Thanks for the advice.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.398
Do you even know how
to throw snowballs?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.513
- Oh, hey.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.715
- Hi, Aunt Maggie.
- You're back, how was it?

31:57.716 --> 31:59.250
- Awesome.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.651
Thanks for bringing us here.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.132
- Oh honey, you are
more than welcome.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.523
- Are you busy?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.658
- Oh, just writing
down a recipe.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.760
- Do you ever give
away your recipes.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.031
- Well, I may leave out
an ingredient or two.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.765
- No way.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.933
- Karma?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.903
- Oh, karma nothing.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.406
Somebody's gonna take this
thing, they are gonna make it

32:21.407 --> 32:22.773
and then they are gonna
claim it for their own.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.542
- Mm hm.
- Mm hm.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.477
- So, you do this
every Christmas?

32:26.478 --> 32:27.478
- I do.

32:29.448 --> 32:33.219
I know, it's pretty exhausting,
but I love it up here.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.523
And I love seeing my friends.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.425
- Why don't you
just live up here?

32:40.426 --> 32:41.027
- Are you trying to get
rid of me already?

32:41.028 --> 32:42.760
- No, no.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.996
- Oh, honey, honey, honey,
I know what you mean.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.117
Why haven't I sold the farm?

32:47.699 --> 32:50.435
Or in this case, the bakery.

32:50.436 --> 32:55.273
And the truth is I really
haven't put together

32:55.274 --> 32:56.675
the whole nest egg
I need to retire.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.514
Unfortunately I'm
missin' the yolk.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.252
But that's okay.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.821
That's okay, you know
what, I tell you what,

33:10.822 --> 33:12.890
let's pack up the car.

33:12.891 --> 33:15.726
Let's do that because
those roads out there

33:15.727 --> 33:17.567
they get very dangerous
when it starts snowin'.

33:18.964 --> 33:19.831
- All right, yeah.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.799
We're on it.

33:20.799 --> 33:21.567
Yeah, we're on it.

33:21.568 --> 33:22.700
- Okay perfect.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.635
Here sweetheart,
could you hold that?

33:23.636 --> 33:25.870
And could you take
this one as well?

33:25.871 --> 33:29.674
Wonderful, terrific, and
I will get our santa.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.675
- Awesome.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.092
- All right, here you go.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.759
- Wow, these look
absolutely spectacular.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.860
- Aw, thank you.
- Thank you, so much.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.296
- Sure thing, Merry Christmas.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.563
- Merry Christmas to you too.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.700
You know, there's an awful
lot of cookies here.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.102
I was wondering if you
wouldn't mind helping

33:57.103 --> 33:58.736
me eat these later on tonight.

33:58.737 --> 33:59.937
I could come by around 7:00,
pick you up for dinner,

33:59.938 --> 34:02.173
we already have dessert.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.242
The cookies are no doubt as
delicious as they look given,

34:04.243 --> 34:05.610
not to mention you would know.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.512
What do you say?

34:07.513 --> 34:11.181
- I am very, very flattered,
but I have a boyfriend.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.451
- He's a very lucky guy, thank
you so much for the cookies.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.719
Merry Christmas to you.
- Merry Christmas to you.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.853
- Take care.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.888
- Mr. Foxworth, hi.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.889
- Hello, Nina, what a
lovely Christmas tree.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.291
- Oh, thank you.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.159
- Have you seen Raven around?

34:21.161 --> 34:23.893
- Um, she's not back yet.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.896
Maybe there's something I
could help you with, though?

34:25.897 --> 34:27.931
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

34:27.933 --> 34:28.966
Have you been busy?

34:28.967 --> 34:32.270
- Um, not really.

34:32.271 --> 34:35.340
Maggie hasn't been doing
very well financially.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.775
So, you know, it's been hard.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.511
Yeah.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.112
Is there anything I can
get for you though,

34:41.114 --> 34:43.148
while you're here?

34:43.149 --> 34:44.382
- Would you have
any ideas on what

34:44.382 --> 34:45.703
I could get my wife
for Christmas?

34:46.885 --> 34:48.152
- Cookies.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.221
- Cookies?
- Cookies.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.322
- Cookies it is, then.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.524
- All right, I'm gettin' some.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.296
There you go.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.997
- These are great
and how much...

34:59.998 --> 35:01.366
- Oh, they're on the house.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.867
- Thank you, Nina.

35:02.868 --> 35:03.702
- Yeah, no problem.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.470
- Merry Christmas.

35:04.471 --> 35:05.970
- Merry Christmas to you.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.939
- Take care.
- Drive safe.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.760
♪ Come December ♪

35:29.761 --> 35:32.898
♪ Where all your
dreams come true ♪

35:40.539 --> 35:43.174
♪ Come December ♪

35:43.175 --> 35:44.609
- Hey there, we're back.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.344
- Hey, you're back
sooner than I thought.

35:46.345 --> 35:47.978
- That's right.
- Raven, your dad just left.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.880
- Oh.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.517
- So, tell me how
was business today?

35:52.518 --> 35:55.320
- Well, it wasn't very busy,

35:55.321 --> 35:56.954
but I did just power
clean everything.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.356
- Well, that's fantastic.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.024
It's fantastic.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.025
Oh dear.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.159
- Hm, yeah.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.362
- I see the dreaded mail carrier

36:04.363 --> 36:05.996
dared to show his face
here again today.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.165
Oh my. - Yeah.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.868
- See y'all, I was really
hoping that that coupon in the.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.937
West Side Penny Saver was
gonna bring some people in.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.672
- Isn't that the free paper

36:14.673 --> 36:15.973
that everybody gets
tossed in their driveway?

36:15.974 --> 36:17.208
- It sure is.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.409
- And then the
gardener runs it over?

36:18.410 --> 36:20.778
- Well, I guess
that could happen.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.814
- Actually, it's usually the
sprinkler systems that soak it.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.516
- Well, if you're a big water
waster, then all right then.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.353
- Aw, so, how was
the Crows Roost?

36:28.354 --> 36:28.820
- It was awesome.
- Thrilling.

36:28.821 --> 36:29.920
- Cool.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.201
- There you see, it was awesome.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.044
All right, I'm gonna go
make up the supply order.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.963
Oh, put a ad in the
Penny Saver, Maggie.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.533
There's a big circulation, yeah.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.572
- You know this place could
use a few finishing touches.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.073
- Well then, I think you're the
perfect person for the job.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.341
- Great idea.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.377
- But I must
forewarn you ladies,

36:52.378 --> 36:54.312
I'm the Duke of Decorations.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.046
- Oh.
- Okay, I mean I'm the master

36:56.047 --> 36:57.548
of crate paper.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.351
In fact, streamer,
it's my middle name.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.519
- Aw, let's get you a ladder.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.153
- Yeah, why not.
- Yeah.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.154
- Oh!

37:04.856 --> 37:06.358
- Aunt Maggie.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.895
- Oh, oh kids.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.764
Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry,
this is so embarrassing.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.032
- Aunt Maggie, you
need to take it slow.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.834
- Yeah, no, no, Aunt Maggie,

37:16.835 --> 37:19.069
why don't you just go home,
get some rest, okay?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.838
We'll look after the
bakery, don't worry.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.939
- You know, honey,
I probably should.

37:21.940 --> 37:22.674
- Should I call a cab?

37:22.675 --> 37:24.375
- No, honey, darling, no.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.443
I'll call Herb to
come pick me up.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.511
It's fine.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.178
Here, okay, here we go.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.447
Up. - Okay.

37:29.448 --> 37:29.948
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

37:29.949 --> 37:31.015
There we go.

37:31.016 --> 37:31.783
- Okay.
- All right.

37:31.784 --> 37:32.883
- Kids, could y'all make sure

37:32.884 --> 37:34.685
that everything's
locked up here?

37:34.686 --> 37:35.487
- Of course.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

37:35.488 --> 37:36.654
- All right, it's okay.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.389
Do you wanna rest
on my shoulder.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.590
- Oh, honey, I don't
wanna hurt you.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.958
- I'll do all right,
just go slow.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.160
- Okay, whoa.
- Just put one foot in front

37:43.161 --> 37:45.463
of the other, you got this.
- Thank you, darling.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.464
- We should go home.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.368
- I'll get the lights.
- All right.

38:12.391 --> 38:15.326
- So, are you ready
to get started?

38:15.327 --> 38:16.327
- Get started?

38:17.863 --> 38:19.330
- Yeah, I mean, I
don't know about you,

38:19.331 --> 38:20.411
but I really need this job.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.535
Also, I'm sure that your Aunt
Maggie doesn't wanna lose

38:24.536 --> 38:26.036
the customers that
she does have...

38:26.037 --> 38:26.972
- To the cupcake people?

38:26.972 --> 38:27.972
- Exactly.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.876
- If my Mom was still here,

38:31.877 --> 38:33.917
she coulda taught me how to
make Aunt Maggie's pies.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.651
May I help you?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.132
- Yeah, I just came
by to order a pie.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.822
No eviction notice this time.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.823
- A what?

38:46.291 --> 38:47.425
- A pie.

38:47.426 --> 38:50.428
This is a bakery, right?

38:50.429 --> 38:51.796
It's for my daughter.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.964
It's her birthday tomorrow.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.300
- Are you serious.
- Raven, let me handle this.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.235
What kinda pie would you like?

38:57.236 --> 38:58.404
- A crumble pie.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.307
- A crumble pie, yeah,
she'd love that.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.075
- That's great.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.178
- Good, so, tomorrow, same time?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.147
- Yeah.
- I'll pick it up.

39:09.148 --> 39:10.581
- Sounds perfect.

39:10.582 --> 39:11.817
- Great, ladies.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.658
- So, why did he say
eviction notice.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.400
- You should talk to
your Aunt about that.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.200
Pretty tree though, huh?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.201
- Nathan.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.406
I'm gonna surprise them
and have the pipes fixed.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.542
Ah, you sweetheart, how are you?

39:37.543 --> 39:39.063
Thank you, I very
much appreciate that.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.759
I would love for
you to be there.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.982
How are you?

39:44.983 --> 39:47.885
Nathan, before you answer, I
want you to spend Christmas

39:47.886 --> 39:49.726
with our family, so come
over around 6:00 p.m..

39:55.360 --> 39:56.961
- Oh, Mrs. Foxworth.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.162
- Well, hello.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.798
- Hi, what can I get for you?

40:00.799 --> 40:04.702
- Well, I'm here to order
Maggie's famous apple crust pie.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.704
- Oh, unfortunately, we
don't have any of those

40:06.705 --> 40:08.573
ready just yet, but I do
have some chocolate cream.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.240
- Oh, I don't really like that.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.042
- Oh.

40:12.043 --> 40:15.880
- You know, I always order
Maggie's famous apple crust pie.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.848
Well, she knows I
always order it once

40:17.849 --> 40:19.449
a week when my boys
come home for dinner.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.720
Is she here?

40:22.721 --> 40:24.455
- She's not in today.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.123
- Oh, I'm really out of luck.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.658
- But the pies
should be out soon.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.659
- How soon?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.396
- Maybe five minutes?
- Oh, I don't know.

40:32.397 --> 40:33.864
- I'll tell you what.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.399
Why don't you have
a seat over there

40:35.400 --> 40:38.102
and I'll give you a cookie
on the house while you wait.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.204
- What kind of a cookie?

40:40.205 --> 40:42.507
- Macadamia nut?

40:42.508 --> 40:44.374
- With that, you have a deal.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.276
- All right, I had a feeling.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.078
- Oh, and two.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.747
Thank you so much. - Absolutely.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.516
- You know, the bakery
looks just beautiful.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.417
- Aw.
- So Christmasy.

40:52.418 --> 40:54.084
- Aw, thank you.

40:54.085 --> 40:54.986
- I'll really enjoy
this, thank you, again.

40:54.987 --> 40:57.254
- Please do.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.689
I'll let you know
when the pies are up.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.010
- Oh, I'll let you
know how it is.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.265
Mm, delicious.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.266
Certainly worth the wait.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.176
- This is so why I
quit spin class.

41:21.913 --> 41:22.913
Grandma?

41:23.448 --> 41:24.448
- Raven.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.417
What are you doing here?

41:27.418 --> 41:28.686
What a surprise.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.787
- I work here.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.689
- Well, I didn't know that.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.791
Raven, I don't see
enough of you.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.660
You have to come
over more often.

41:35.661 --> 41:36.961
- Yes, Grandma.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.863
Do you need anything else?

41:38.864 --> 41:41.265
- No, I'm just waiting
for my apple crust pies.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.499
Now you go ahead, I don't
wanna make you late.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.101
- Okay.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.136
- Today we're taking up
a collection for the

41:46.137 --> 41:49.674
children's hospital and Santa
knows you'll give generously,

41:49.675 --> 41:52.009
because it's Christmas
right here.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.477
Right here.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.478
Oh.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.382
- Do you work here?

41:58.383 --> 42:00.184
Can we get cake?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.052
- Excuse me?

42:01.053 --> 42:02.452
- Are you deaf?

42:02.453 --> 42:03.988
- I, I'm.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.656
- Oh, you know what,
I'm happy to help you.

42:05.657 --> 42:06.657
What can we got for you?

42:06.658 --> 42:08.325
- Cake, we want cake.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.094
- Okay, cool, what kind
of cake would you like?

42:10.095 --> 42:11.562
- Our cake?

42:11.563 --> 42:13.030
- Okay, and what kind of cake

42:13.031 --> 42:15.333
would you like your cake to be?

42:21.873 --> 42:24.508
- Where is our cake?

42:24.509 --> 42:27.745
- Ah, you know what, I
have your cake right here,

42:27.746 --> 42:29.346
it's a German Chocolate.

42:29.347 --> 42:30.347
- Was it so difficult?

42:31.617 --> 42:33.051
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

42:35.721 --> 42:36.721
Oh, all right.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.058
Let me go check on my pies.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.266
- Merry Christmas.

42:50.535 --> 42:52.503
Merry Christmas.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.573
Merry Christmas.

42:58.109 --> 43:00.679
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.210
- So, are they
always so charming?

43:14.893 --> 43:16.927
- They're regulars, so
we tend to overlook

43:16.928 --> 43:19.563
their more eccentric qualities.

43:19.564 --> 43:20.564
- Qualities?

43:22.901 --> 43:24.821
- In the most exaggerated
definition of the word.

43:26.672 --> 43:28.105
- When my dad
stopped by earlier,

43:28.106 --> 43:29.907
did he ask you for any
suggestions for Christmas?

43:29.908 --> 43:32.176
- Yeah, it was lame.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.417
Like I have any idea what rich
people get for each other.

43:35.914 --> 43:38.382
Also, since he did ask,

43:38.383 --> 43:40.517
I told him about our
financial troubles.

43:40.518 --> 43:43.553
I thought maybe he could help.

43:43.554 --> 43:44.554
- What did he say?

43:45.590 --> 43:47.192
- He didn't say anything.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.459
That's my cookies.

43:52.497 --> 43:53.497
Good job.

44:05.677 --> 44:06.611
- Those look and
smell amazing, Nina.

44:06.611 --> 44:07.611
- Thank you.

44:09.114 --> 44:10.114
All right.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.218
Comin' out.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.421
- You know, keeping
the displays filled

44:17.422 --> 44:18.989
isn't gonna bring
in new customers.

44:18.990 --> 44:19.958
- You're absolutely right.

44:19.959 --> 44:21.926
You know what, I'm on it.

44:21.927 --> 44:22.694
- Where are you going with that?

44:22.695 --> 44:23.961
- Uh, to captivate an audience.

44:23.962 --> 44:24.962
- That is a great idea.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.664
- Bring some flyers with you.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.499
- Way ahead of ya.

44:28.499 --> 44:29.499
- Thanks, Jerry.

44:30.301 --> 44:31.369
I've got it.

44:49.855 --> 44:50.855
Not again.

44:53.424 --> 44:54.424
- Is my pie ready?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.160
- Not yet.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.429
- Where's Maggie?

44:59.430 --> 45:00.430
- Not here at the moment.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.736
- This space right here, you'd
say it's what, 12 by 20?

45:06.437 --> 45:07.717
It's a lot of really good space.

45:09.841 --> 45:11.441
- What an opportunist.

45:11.442 --> 45:13.377
- I stink at math.

45:13.378 --> 45:16.882
- Uh huh, but you
can read, right?

45:21.619 --> 45:24.789
You tell Maggie, that this needs
to be taken care of right

45:24.790 --> 45:26.990
away or I'll be forced to take
another course of action.

45:28.326 --> 45:29.326
Soon.

45:31.362 --> 45:32.802
I'll be back later
to pick up my pie.

45:38.103 --> 45:39.170
- Go ahead, open it.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.275
- Ouch.

45:45.276 --> 45:46.276
- Ouch is right.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.498
- Oh look, it's Jerry.

46:08.499 --> 46:10.067
- Aw, you workin', Jerry?

46:10.068 --> 46:12.136
- Yes, I am, what gave it away?

46:12.137 --> 46:13.971
- Are these samples?

46:13.972 --> 46:16.006
- Yeah, they're for
potential customers.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.274
- Are they low carb?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.275
Gluten free?

46:19.077 --> 46:21.812
- No, they're from a bakery.

46:21.813 --> 46:22.880
Raven's working at the bakery.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.314
- Raven?

46:24.315 --> 46:25.315
Raven Foxworth?

46:26.484 --> 46:28.819
Where's this bakery?

46:28.820 --> 46:30.454
- I don't see why
that's important.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.335
- You know what, we'll
find it ourselves, moron.

46:34.392 --> 46:35.392
- Where did that come...

46:38.629 --> 46:39.629
So rude.

46:41.799 --> 46:42.968
Steppin' all over Jerry.

46:45.871 --> 46:46.871
Whatever.

46:47.939 --> 46:48.939
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

46:51.109 --> 46:54.044
Hey girls, you guys should
enter this contest.

46:54.045 --> 46:56.313
I'm one of the judges and
you could win $10,000.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.248
- The Out of the Box
Holiday Bake Off?

46:58.249 --> 46:59.569
- Yes, I hear your
pies are great.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.519
Anyway, I hope to see you there.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.720
Merry Christmas.

47:03.721 --> 47:04.721
- Bye.
- Merry Christmas.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.526
- What's this about anyways?

47:09.527 --> 47:12.196
- Oh, it's a contest they do
once a year in Crows Roost.

47:12.197 --> 47:14.531
- $10,000 is sure
a lot of money.

47:14.532 --> 47:17.501
- Yeah, it would be
really great right now

47:17.502 --> 47:18.936
because my dad's
been out of work.

47:18.937 --> 47:21.638
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

47:21.639 --> 47:23.407
But speaking of baking desserts,

47:23.408 --> 47:25.248
I think that pie is gotta
come out of the oven.

47:33.251 --> 47:35.285
- It's my understanding that
your interest lies in a much

47:35.286 --> 47:37.206
bigger project than just
repossessing the bakery.

47:39.257 --> 47:41.191
- And where'd you get
that information from?

47:41.192 --> 47:42.192
- I have my sources.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.630
- What do you want,
Mr. Foxworth?

47:46.631 --> 47:47.999
- Well, I think I can help you.

47:50.135 --> 47:51.135
I'll be able to
implement a plan that

47:51.136 --> 47:52.403
is far more profitable for you.

47:54.139 --> 47:55.672
- Like where?

47:55.673 --> 47:58.108
- Like here.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.776
Beverly Hills is one of
the most desirable places

47:59.777 --> 48:01.379
to be in the entire world.

48:03.982 --> 48:05.302
- Is that why you
brought me here?

48:06.751 --> 48:08.352
- Yes, indeed it is.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.353
Wouldn't you rather
build your resort

48:09.354 --> 48:11.721
here than up in the woods?

48:11.722 --> 48:15.892
- Well, is it a guaranteed deal?

48:15.893 --> 48:17.253
- Let's just say
it's a sure thing.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.465
Look, I could pay rent and you'll
never hear from us again...

48:21.466 --> 48:22.367
- Why would you do that?

48:22.368 --> 48:23.567
- Do what?

48:23.568 --> 48:24.568
- Waste money?

48:26.504 --> 48:30.274
That bakery has been at a
loss for the past two years.

48:30.275 --> 48:33.344
- Because I'm a benefactor
and Maggie, she's family.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.016
- Doesn't sound like a
business man I'm talking to.

48:39.017 --> 48:41.319
- Mr. Turner, it's not
always about money.

48:42.687 --> 48:43.687
- Is that right?

48:45.223 --> 48:47.224
- My recommendation is for you

48:47.225 --> 48:49.961
to review these plans
and reconsider.

48:52.830 --> 48:55.099
- Well, you've certainly spiked
my interest, Mr. Foxworth,

48:55.100 --> 48:56.933
but I can't guarantee anything.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.070
But I will look at these prints.

49:00.638 --> 49:01.638
- Very good.

49:01.639 --> 49:03.173
- Wonderful.

49:03.174 --> 49:05.642
- Join me for lunch.

49:05.643 --> 49:08.003
We have a wonderful restaurant
that's not too far from here.

49:12.683 --> 49:14.019
- Raven, we have a problem.

49:16.587 --> 49:17.988
- Oh, no.

49:17.989 --> 49:19.323
- I'll get the mop.

49:19.324 --> 49:21.058
- It's not you,
it's the same leak

49:21.059 --> 49:22.326
that keeps happening
over and over again.

49:22.327 --> 49:24.628
- This place needs a renovation.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.164
- Maggie just used to wrap
the pipe in duck tape

49:27.165 --> 49:29.899
until she had time for
the plumber to come.

49:29.900 --> 49:31.901
- We could always call the
plumber from the soup kitchen.

49:31.902 --> 49:32.902
What was his name?

49:34.239 --> 49:35.573
Anthony, he works for cheap.

49:37.742 --> 49:39.110
- It's worth a shot.

50:04.769 --> 50:07.089
- How about you guys go get me
a coffee instead of staring?

50:11.276 --> 50:13.009
Hey, I'm workin' here.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.279
Would you guys please
get outa here?

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
- So are we plum?

50:18.116 --> 50:19.116
- We are not plum.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.687
- Great.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.655
- Oh yeah, that's a
good flavor, too.

50:25.656 --> 50:27.091
Plum?

50:27.092 --> 50:28.092
No one, Bueller?

50:29.260 --> 50:30.260
Tough crowd.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.280
- Gonna need a few more
pieces to fix this.

50:39.237 --> 50:40.837
- Really?

50:40.838 --> 50:42.838
- Should only take a piece
of drywall and some mud.

50:43.808 --> 50:45.075
- Right.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.443
Why don't you give it a try?

50:46.444 --> 50:47.811
- Since when do you know
anything about drywall?

50:47.812 --> 50:50.147
- I watch the home
improvement channel.

50:50.148 --> 50:51.715
- So who's gonna pay for this?

50:51.716 --> 50:53.417
- I guess we can put I
on the bakery's account.

50:53.418 --> 50:54.219
- I'm gonna have to
get full payment

50:54.220 --> 50:55.719
for that while I'm here today.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.487
- I'll get my card.

50:56.487 --> 50:57.487
- I'll need cash, please.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.677
- This has been a nightmare.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.441
- Hi, Mrs. Hawkins.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.476
What can I do for you?

51:19.477 --> 51:21.545
- Well, I'm here to
pickup my pecan pies.

51:21.546 --> 51:24.414
- Oh, well we're actually having
a bit of a plumbing issue

51:24.415 --> 51:27.251
right now, so unfortunately
we don't have any pies.

51:27.252 --> 51:29.253
- What kind of plumbing problem.

51:29.254 --> 51:30.221
Maybe I can help? - Help?

51:30.222 --> 51:31.721
I'm afraid you can't,

51:31.722 --> 51:33.957
but that's really
nice of you to offer.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.592
- I was really hoping
to have those today.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.594
I have a big family dinner.

51:37.595 --> 51:38.728
- Well, what about some
of Maggie's cookies?

51:38.729 --> 51:40.630
They're delicious.

51:40.631 --> 51:43.900
- No, my nephews love
their pecan pies.

51:43.901 --> 51:45.935
- When would you need them by?

51:45.936 --> 51:47.472
- Well, tonight, I guess.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.241
- Great, we'll see you then.

51:51.242 --> 51:53.777
- Well, that sounds marvelous.

51:53.778 --> 51:54.778
I'll stop by later then.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.182
- Why did you promise her pies?

51:58.183 --> 52:00.417
Our kitchen is down.

52:00.418 --> 52:02.952
- Look, Maggie's having
some financial troubles.

52:02.953 --> 52:06.323
- Yeah, well, 10 pecan pies
is not gonna change that.

52:06.324 --> 52:07.484
- We have to start somewhere.

52:09.494 --> 52:10.094
I know where we can
bake in the meantime.

52:10.095 --> 52:11.095
- Where?

52:11.095 --> 52:12.095
- The soup kitchen.

52:14.432 --> 52:15.965
- Well, who's gonna look
after the shop, then?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.567
- Jerry.

52:17.568 --> 52:19.269
- All right, I'll go
look for the recipe.

52:19.270 --> 52:20.270
Excuse me.

52:21.306 --> 52:22.273
- Jerry, what?

52:22.274 --> 52:23.640
- You have to stay here.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.209
We're gonna go bake some pies.

52:25.210 --> 52:26.376
- Oh, where at?

52:26.377 --> 52:27.278
- The soup kitchen.

52:27.279 --> 52:28.312
- All right, I got it.

52:28.313 --> 52:30.414
Let's go. - Awesome.

52:30.415 --> 52:33.383
- We'll be back.
- Hey, guys, for how long?

52:33.384 --> 52:34.384
Wait, guys?

52:36.254 --> 52:37.614
- Hey buddy, so
who's gonna pay me?

52:44.529 --> 52:45.529
- Oh.

52:52.803 --> 52:54.123
- I think it's ready.
- You think?

52:55.340 --> 52:56.841
- Oh, I hope this works.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.210
Sorry I brought
the wrong recipe.

53:00.211 --> 53:00.845
Can you get that?

53:00.845 --> 53:01.845
Thanks.

53:03.581 --> 53:04.848
- If it sucks we can
just start over.

53:04.849 --> 53:06.783
- I like that attitude.

53:06.784 --> 53:08.352
- Now we just have to
wait until it's not

53:08.353 --> 53:10.119
the temperature of
liquid lava anymore.

53:10.120 --> 53:10.721
- A while, I guess?

53:10.721 --> 53:11.721
- Mm hm.

53:13.358 --> 53:15.925
You know, I think
my mom had a copy

53:15.926 --> 53:17.994
of Maggie's pumpkin
pecan pie recipe.

53:17.995 --> 53:19.963
What?

53:19.964 --> 53:21.798
- I know how Aunt Maggie
shares her recipes.

53:21.799 --> 53:24.601
- Oh, the missing
ingredient thing?

53:24.602 --> 53:26.936
Yeah, well, she never leaves
out anything that's important.

53:26.937 --> 53:28.472
- Like pumpkin pecans.

53:28.473 --> 53:29.793
- Right, like
pumpkins and pecans.

53:34.645 --> 53:37.548
I don't know, I feel like
it doesn't' smell right.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.653
- Oh mom, what would you do?

53:48.993 --> 53:51.561
Hey Nina, is this the
wrong recipe you took?

53:51.562 --> 53:53.363
- Yeah, that's the one.

53:53.364 --> 53:54.364
- Apple crumble?
- Mm hm.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.635
- My mom used to make
this all the time.

53:58.636 --> 54:00.003
I remember her saying it was
Aunt Maggie's best recipe.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.005
- Oh, but so what?

54:03.441 --> 54:05.842
- It's the best pie
I've ever had.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.777
How would you feel about
joining forces and making.

54:07.778 --> 54:09.498
Aunt Maggie's apple
crumble for the contest?

54:11.616 --> 54:14.217
We can split the prize money.

54:14.218 --> 54:16.378
- I really wanted the prize
money to give to my family.

54:17.855 --> 54:19.656
- I'll give my half
to Aunt Maggie

54:19.657 --> 54:21.857
so she can keep open her shop
and you can keep your job.

54:22.627 --> 54:24.394
- All right, it's a deal.

54:24.395 --> 54:25.762
High five.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.731
Yes, all right.

54:27.732 --> 54:28.852
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

54:31.502 --> 54:32.702
What are we gonna do with you?

54:34.104 --> 54:35.104
Ow.

54:36.541 --> 54:38.208
I forgot the cinnamon.

54:48.753 --> 54:53.056
- It's been a very
different Christmas.

54:53.057 --> 54:54.358
Usually at this time
of the year we're

54:54.359 --> 54:56.760
all very excited with the
Christmas dinner preparation.

54:56.761 --> 54:59.062
- No, I understand.

54:59.063 --> 55:00.423
- My main concern
are the children.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.468
They won't have a place
to celebrate Christmas

55:04.469 --> 55:07.337
if we don't find a
solution very soon.

55:07.338 --> 55:10.039
- Well, Deacon Scott, as I
told you, I called the mayors

55:10.040 --> 55:12.200
office and he's going to do
everything today to fix it.

55:13.711 --> 55:15.231
His office will be
calling you shortly.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.514
- Sounds marvelous, and
I'll add some prayers.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.722
So, what exactly is bothering
you, Mr. Foxworth?

55:25.723 --> 55:28.592
- My daughter, Raven,

55:28.593 --> 55:31.027
she's been difficult
to deal with lately.

55:31.028 --> 55:32.730
- Well, she's at that age.

55:35.933 --> 55:37.693
I wouldn't worry your
mind too much about it.

55:39.236 --> 55:41.170
- Has she been visiting you?

55:41.171 --> 55:42.406
- Yes, she's actually
at the soup kitchen

55:42.407 --> 55:44.508
in the church right now.

55:44.509 --> 55:45.509
- Really?

55:46.511 --> 55:48.978
I thought it was closed.

55:48.979 --> 55:51.147
- Well, I had them open
the kitchen for her.

55:51.148 --> 55:52.549
She said something about she had

55:52.550 --> 55:55.419
to make some pies for
her Aunt's bakery.

55:55.420 --> 55:57.500
Apparently they're having a
plumbing problem as well.

55:59.524 --> 56:00.524
What's wrong now?

56:01.492 --> 56:02.492
- Nothing.

56:04.328 --> 56:06.496
I think I'm gonna pay a little
visit to the soup kitchen

56:06.497 --> 56:07.497
and speak to her.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.366
- Well, Amen.

56:11.569 --> 56:12.609
I can be there if need be.

56:13.871 --> 56:14.871
- That's great.

56:16.273 --> 56:18.008
♪ Amen, Amen ♪

56:23.047 --> 56:25.449
- Is there anything else that
I can do for the church?

56:25.450 --> 56:27.617
- Oh, Mr. Foxworth, you've done
quite enough for the church.

56:27.618 --> 56:29.786
- It's my pleasure.

56:29.787 --> 56:32.422
- By the way, Dad, what
are you doing here?

56:32.423 --> 56:35.324
- Well, I decided to place an
order for the soup kitchen.

56:35.325 --> 56:37.427
- Dad, really?

56:37.428 --> 56:38.762
- I gave a lot of thought to
what you said to me, Raven,

56:38.763 --> 56:40.830
and I pulled a few strings

56:40.831 --> 56:43.500
at City Hall, and
Christmas dinner is on.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.568
- Great.

56:44.569 --> 56:45.569
More baking.

56:46.971 --> 56:49.673
- What's wrong, Raven,
you look concerned?

56:49.674 --> 56:51.594
- It's just Aunt Maggie,
she's not doing so well.

56:52.443 --> 56:53.877
- Hm.

56:53.878 --> 56:54.878
Well...

56:59.316 --> 57:00.316
We're all in God's hands.

57:20.170 --> 57:21.170
- Nathan.

57:23.508 --> 57:24.508
Nathan.

57:31.882 --> 57:34.584
- So, once you have it
rolled you wanna kinda use

57:34.585 --> 57:37.253
the rolling pin to fill
in all the cracks.

57:37.254 --> 57:39.756
It's really important
to keep the pie, hey.

57:39.757 --> 57:41.991
- Ingredients for two
pies, did you get it?

57:41.992 --> 57:43.927
- Yup, got one bag
of flour right here.

57:43.928 --> 57:46.195
- Awesome.
- It's on.

57:46.196 --> 57:48.966
- And you know your assistant
is ready, willing and able.

57:49.834 --> 57:50.535
- Bam, let's do this.

57:50.536 --> 57:51.701
- Let's do it.

57:51.702 --> 57:52.302
- All right.
- All right.

57:52.302 --> 57:53.137
- Let's do it.

57:53.138 --> 57:54.638
- Let's do it.

57:54.639 --> 57:56.139
- Have you ever used a peeler?

57:56.140 --> 57:57.473
I think I'm gonna put
you on apple duty

57:57.474 --> 57:58.942
so grab that knife. - All right.

57:58.943 --> 58:00.443
- I'm gonna give the cutting
board in just a second.

58:00.444 --> 58:01.278
And you've got this.

58:01.279 --> 58:03.446
Ready.

58:03.447 --> 58:05.148
- There we go.

58:05.149 --> 58:06.149
- Step one.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.184
Looks good.

58:19.463 --> 58:20.897
See how much fun this is?

58:20.898 --> 58:22.018
Don't forget this bowl, too.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.238
- What?

58:32.743 --> 58:33.743
- Bakin' a pie.

58:37.214 --> 58:38.214
- We did it.
- Phew.

58:40.417 --> 58:42.218
- Well, we did it.

58:42.219 --> 58:44.453
We made a pie.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.890
- Hey, so, any word
on Aunt Maggie?

58:46.891 --> 58:48.324
- She feels much better.

58:48.325 --> 58:49.593
She'll be at the shop tomorrow.

58:49.594 --> 58:53.229
- Good, and this pie
smells amazing.

58:53.230 --> 58:55.632
- I just hope that it tastes
as good as it smells.

58:55.633 --> 58:57.100
- Yeah.
- Try some.

58:57.101 --> 58:58.735
- Yeah, yeah?

58:58.736 --> 58:59.936
- Try a bite.

58:59.937 --> 59:00.937
- Okay.

59:05.676 --> 59:06.543
That's amazing.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.577
- Is it?

59:07.578 --> 59:08.478
- Mm hm, try it.

59:08.478 --> 59:09.478
- No, I'll just.

59:13.651 --> 59:14.951
Oh, wow.

59:14.952 --> 59:16.953
Oh, wow.

59:16.954 --> 59:18.454
Okay. - Like, how good?

59:18.455 --> 59:20.156
- Like, really, really good.

59:20.157 --> 59:21.257
Raven, try some.

59:21.258 --> 59:22.192
- It is so good.

59:22.193 --> 59:23.273
- I told you.
- Oh, my gosh.

59:24.662 --> 59:26.195
We made that.

59:26.196 --> 59:27.031
- We did.

59:27.032 --> 59:28.998
- We're a pretty good team.

59:28.999 --> 59:30.333
- I'm pretty proud of us, yeah?

59:30.334 --> 59:32.168
- I think we're gonna win.

59:32.169 --> 59:34.537
- Yeah, that's amazing.

59:34.538 --> 59:36.906
- Oh, it's so.

59:36.907 --> 59:37.907
Well, don't eat it all.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.711
This is a winning pie.

59:41.712 --> 59:42.479
- Well, don't eat all of it.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.547
- I know, don't.

59:44.548 --> 59:45.382
Save some for the rest of us.
- I mean, come on.

59:45.382 --> 59:46.382
Yeah, exactly.

59:48.552 --> 59:49.585
- Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.188
That's amazing.

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:03.733
- Morning.
- Oh.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:04.568
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:00:04.569 --> 01:00:05.601
- Morning.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.070
Here you go, sweetheart.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.571
- Oh, Aunt Maggie has
a rule about there

01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:11.007
being no pets in the shop.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.942
- I told you I have
to go to work today.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.511
- Well, he can't stay here.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:17.013
- Well, you have to keep him.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.683
I can't take him and I can't
leave him in the car.

01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:20.684
Gotta go, bye sweetheart.

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:23.887
- Bye Uncle Steve.

01:00:23.888 --> 01:00:25.221
- It's all right, Raven,
we'll work it out.

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:26.222
- Okay.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.458
- He's really cute.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:34.931
- Bunny, stay here.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:36.572
- All right, let's go
check on those pies.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.106
- Raven, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.208
Bunny.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.277
Don't even think
about it, Bunny.

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.278
No.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.782
Bunny, no!

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:53.783
Bunny!

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.319
Ugh, Bunny!

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.387
Bunny, stop!

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:01.858
No, Bunny, Bunny, stop!

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:03.927
Bunny, stop!

01:01:03.928 --> 01:01:05.594
What's happening to my powers.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.363
Oh, no.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.999
Bunny, stop!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.701
Bunny, you're ruining
everything there.

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:13.269
Please, God, help.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.537
Help, God.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:16.339
God, help.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340
Raven.

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:19.844
- Oh, my gosh, Bunny!

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.781
- My pie.

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:26.983
Oh, no, my pie!

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:27.351
What are we gonna do?
- I don't think

01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:28.684
he looks right.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:29.586
- Of course, he
doesn't look right.

01:01:29.587 --> 01:01:30.954
He just ate an entire pie
that is bigger than him.

01:01:30.955 --> 01:01:32.521
- Somebody call 911.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.857
Somebody call 911, Jerry please.

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.825
- You don't call 911 for a dog.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:36.761
- Quick, please, call the vet.

01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:37.627
- You call the vet.

01:01:37.628 --> 01:01:38.762
Get him out of here.

01:01:38.763 --> 01:01:40.697
He's a little monster.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:42.565
- Oh, God.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:45.434
- It's gonna be all right.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.570
It's gonna be all right.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.756
- Hey there.

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:07.591
- Hey Aunt Maggie.
- Hey Aunt Maggie.

01:02:07.592 --> 01:02:08.825
- Morning.

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:09.827
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:14.964
- So, how is Bunny?

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.732
- He's okay.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.133
The vet said he was
pooping nonstop.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.316
- Oh, that's great to hear.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.974
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:27.710
I am gonna miss this place.

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:28.778
- I'm sorry, Aunt Maggie.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:30.447
- No, sweetheart, no.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:36.285
What you two girls tried
to do for me was so nice.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.954
But saving this
bakery is something

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.889
you couldn't have done anyway.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.125
It's been a longtime coming.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:44.227
- I guess I'm gonna
have to find a new job.

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:46.595
- Oh, honey, no.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.836
- Only a miracle could save us.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:53.037
- God, can you please help them?

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.679
Hey there, good morning.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.048
- Morning.

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:05.449
- How are you doin'
this morning?

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:06.682
- Wonderful, thank you.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:09.153
- Lovely, well, how may
we help you this morning?

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.956
- Last week a young
man was passing out

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:14.290
samples from your bakery.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.758
- Oh.
- That was Jerry.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.493
- Jerry, yes.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.762
- Well, I have found I have not
been able to get the thought

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:22.265
of that delicious crumble
out of my mind ever since.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:23.632
- Oh.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.537
- It had a tangy cherry
filling with a buttery,

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.375
crunchy oatmeal topping.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:34.978
It was delicious.

01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:37.013
- Oh.
- Pardon my distraction.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:37.948
- No worries.

01:03:37.949 --> 01:03:39.548
- Oh, well thank you.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:40.549
That's lovely.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:44.420
And how may we help
you today, Mr...

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.654
- Thomas.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.756
Martin Thomas.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.525
And I'm here to buy your recipe.

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:50.526
- What?

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.764
The Rich and Flour Company?

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.466
- Really?

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.002
- Young lady, there's two
things I never joke about:

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:01.304
money and baked goods.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:03.073
And in this case, your
baked goods are money.

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:07.310
- How much money?

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:08.777
- Well, I can't really discuss
exact figures at the moment.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.180
- Ballpark?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.550
- Well, let's just say it's
a very, very nice ballpark.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:16.453
- Oh.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:22.059
Sweetheart, why don't you give
your father a quick call.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.860
- You got it.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:31.000
- And, Mr. Thomas, why don't
we bring out some lemon filled

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:33.436
cookies for you to enjoy
until he gets here.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:34.703
- Sounds lovely.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:35.871
- Oh absolutely, you
just go have a seat

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:36.940
and we'll be them right on out.

01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:38.074
- Thank you very much.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:38.742
- Of course.
- I'm right on it.

01:04:38.743 --> 01:04:40.210
- There you go and girls.

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:44.914
Just one moment.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.894
- They sure have been
talking for a long time.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.055
- Yeah, and no one's smiling.

01:05:01.065 --> 01:05:03.066
- Poker faces.

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:04.900
- It's freezing out there.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.670
- Well, at least you have that
elf cap to keep you warm.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.911
- And it's Southern California.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:13.309
- Yes, it's a good deal.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.310
Do it.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:21.185
- So, what do you think?

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.655
- You got yourself a deal.

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.724
- A tentative deal.

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:31.227
Of course, until Maggie's
lawyer reviews the proposal.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.562
- Why, of course.

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:35.631
- This is exactly what I
wished for for Christmas.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:36.966
A true miracle.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:38.901
- We aim to please.

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:41.304
- It really is one, isn't it?

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:43.306
- Well, it was very
nice meeting you,

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:45.008
but I've got another
appointment tonight.

01:05:45.009 --> 01:05:46.475
- Oh, you're gonna buy yourself

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:49.145
a few more recipes
tonight, are ya?

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:51.214
- No, actually I'm
playing Santa Claus

01:05:51.215 --> 01:05:51.915
again this year at the
Children's Hospital.

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:52.915
- Aw.

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:55.584
- That is wonderful.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:56.719
- I love the kids, I
do it every year.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.754
- Well, look at you.

01:05:58.755 --> 01:05:59.689
- I'll be in touch.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.157
- Yes, absolutely.

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:01.891
- Take care of yourself, Martin.

01:06:01.892 --> 01:06:03.259
- Bye now.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.695
- Goodbye and thank you.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:12.568
Merry Christmas.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:14.571
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:18.374
Was that too obvious?

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.451
- So, do we have a deal?

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:32.389
- Well, darlin', it
sure looks like it.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:37.626
- Oh, look at the time.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.395
I have to get to the jewelry
store before they close.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:40.996
- What?

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:41.997
- Just kidding.
- Oh.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200
- Oh, that's cute.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.602
- Aunt Maggie.
- Yes?

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:49.472
- This year instead
of buying gifts,

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:50.806
Molly and I decided
to give you this.

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:53.542
- What is this?

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:54.543
Oh, my goodness.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:07:00.349
Oh, my.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.153
Thank you, thank
you all so much.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.989
You all have been so kind to me.

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.990
You've been so kind.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:10.294
Thank you, James.

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:11.294
- You're welcome.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.696
Merry Christmas.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:14.697
- Merry Christmas.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.168
Nina, darlin', we gotta
go finish those pies.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:21.571
- Pie.
- I'll come with you guys.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.243
- I love you, Dad.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:29.645
- I love you too, Raven.

01:07:31.615 --> 01:07:32.935
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.552
I'll see you tonight.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:42.425
- Thanks for the
baking lesson, Mom.

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:43.586
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.163
- Mom?

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:48.164
- I love you.

- Hello, everyone and
Merry Christmas.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:58.234
- Merry Christmas.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:01.304
- The holidays are such a very
special time for everyone,

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.772
and for me it is so dear.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.332
I get to reunite with
family and friends

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:09.877
and to celebrate each
and every one of you,

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.999
for you have played such an
important part in my life.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.651
I'm so blessed for Molly

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.292
and for the joy you've
brought in my life.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:21.843
And I'm also very blessed for
my first wife, Angelina.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.761
For as without her I
would not have blessed

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.243
with such a beautiful
daughter, Raven.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.466
She would've been so proud

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:33.028
of the young lady
you've developed into.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:38.274
- Uh, James, if you don't mind
I'd like to say something.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.142
- Yes, Maggie.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:40.142
- Well, oh my.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:46.515
It isn't everyday that you go
from the edge of bankruptcy,

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:49.819
on your way to becoming
a household brand.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.691
Oh, city mouse.

01:09:57.461 --> 01:09:59.396
I know I haven't seen you
since you were four,

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.934
but I'm sure glad you reentered
my life when you did.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.037
Thank you, honey.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.038
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.276
- And Merry Christmas again.

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:15.279
- Merry Christmas.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.123
- So, are you having fun?

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:29.324
- Yes, it's a beautiful party.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:31.894
Lucille. - Yes?

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.230
- Thank you so much for taking
care of me all these years.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.833
- Oh, honey, it's my pleasure.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.268
You know you can
always count on me.

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:40.470
You're like a daughter to me.

01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:47.610
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:48.777
- Hey.
- I don't even know, yeah.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:49.812
- Kevin.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.580
- Hey, Maggie.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.350
- I am really glad that
we could work things out.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.652
Thank you so much
for your patience.

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.653
- Well, thank you and thank
you for paying in full.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:01.558
You know, thank you
for this invitation.

01:11:01.559 --> 01:11:03.859
It's just so lovely.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.329
- So, Aunt Maggie wanted
me to give you this

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:07.330
for the soup kitchen.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:18.307
- This is an awfully
nice donation.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.376
It's very generous.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.610
- We gave Aunt Maggie the money

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.612
and she wanted you to have it.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.949
- Oh, well, are you sure
she doesn't need it?

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.117
I mean, I know she's been
having some troubles.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.118
- No, she's fine now.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:36.291
- Oh, well thank you.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.427
- Merry Christmas, Herb.

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:40.295
- Merry Christmas to
you too, sweetheart.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.630
- You look good.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.698
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:45.734
This is, it's nice,
a nice party.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.415
Everything's decorated
really, really nice.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:06.288
- Laura?

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:07.856
- Nathan.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:08.857
You can see me?

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.128
Merry Christmas, my love.

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:14.530
- I think about you every day.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:15.531
- I know.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:18.333
But our spirits must separate.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.102
- Don't.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:21.103
- I've gotta go.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440
Love you forever.

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:30.112
- I love you forever.

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.156
Mrs. Foxworth I...

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.461
- Are you all right?

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:46.782
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:51.667
- I guess you could say I have.

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:55.103
- Now everything comes
to the man who waits.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.840
Ever since I lost my husband

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.401
I've always believed
in guardian angels.

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:04.847
So I'm certain that
one, maybe even two,

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.568
might be watching over
our family right now.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:10.886
- Yeah.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:11.755
It's gettin' chilly
out here, come on.

01:13:11.756 --> 01:13:14.490
- You know, I made a
wonderful souffle.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.491
A surprise... - You did?

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:16.959
- Oh, I haven't
done it in years,

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.627
'cause you know
how private I am.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:19.862
- Right.
- I never go out much,

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.597
but I thought it would
be a wonderful Christmas

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:23.532
surprise to all of you.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.300
- Okay, well I can't
wait to try it.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:26.602
- This is lovely.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:27.670
- It's gorgeous, but
I tell you what,

01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:28.938
I need the name of your tailor.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:31.707
- That's Louis Bion,
he's out in Milan.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.842
- Okay, okay, I like it.

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:36.144
- By the way, have
you seen Nathan?

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:39.147
- Yeah, I think he walked
outside for some fresh air.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.984
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.527
- It's all right Lucille.

01:13:51.528 --> 01:13:53.829
I'll handle this.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:56.499
Nice to see unusual
visitors here.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.400
May I help you?

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:00.836
- Yes, I'm missing
my pet Rudolph,

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:02.270
and my old friend here believes

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.606
he may be in your back garden.

01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:04.873
- Oh, really?

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:06.709
- Do you mind if
we go take a look?

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.177
- No, I suppose not.

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:09.946
- Aw, thank you ma'am.

01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:12.548
- Lucille will show you the way.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:15.283
Lucille, Lucille we have
very special guests.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.284
It's Santa.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.688
Now you be nice to Santa.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:21.324
Hurry up, we don't
have all day Santa.

01:14:24.528 --> 01:14:26.028
- Who's that at the
door, grandma?

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:27.309
- Well, it was
Santa and his elf.

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:30.966
- That's a bit odd.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.635
- Well, you see,
he thinks he lost

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:35.504
one of his pets in our backyard.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.239
- Really, and what
is his pet's name?

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.474
- Well, Rudolph of course.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.777
- And you let him in?

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:45.814
- Well, they seem legit,
and they were so nice.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.583
You should've seen
his elf shoes.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:49.351
They were fabulous.

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:50.553
I'd love to own a pair.

01:14:50.554 --> 01:14:52.387
- Well...

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:55.290
- You know, I have decided
that I'm not gonna

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:56.560
be so private in the new year.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:00.696
Do you think he bought those
shoes at the North Pole?

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:01.697
- I'm not sure.

01:15:02.566 --> 01:15:04.432
Let's go find out.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:07.236
- This is so exciting to
have Santa in our backyard.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:27.857
- Now, do you see what I see?

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.794
- If you do, then I do.

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.433
- Hey, you made it back.

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:13.035
Just in time I might add.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:14.703
- I didn't think I had a choice.

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:17.139
- You don't.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.742
But apparently you were very
successful in your mission.

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:22.210
- Does that mean I don't
have to go back to limbo?

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.211
- Only a pardons.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080
- Thank you.

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:31.453
Say, do you ever take
time to go down there?

01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:33.221
- Me?

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:34.222
No, not anymore.

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:36.759
Everyone I love is here.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.429
- I can't wait till
that day comes.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.666
Wait a minute, I can wait.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.731
- You get there by taking
one step at a time.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:51.707
- Thank you.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.610
- You're welcome.
