‐One lamb, one beef, two pork.

‐Halibut, halibut.
‐Oh, halibut...

‐Two scallops?

‐Seven minutes, Chef.

34:18.747 --> 34:20.551
He is lost.

on there is the wool.

34:24.491 --> 34:26.596

34:26.596 --> 34:29.836
I'd rather cook on my own

34:29.836 --> 34:31.438
[bleep] off to your dorm.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.679

two individuals

34:34.679 --> 34:36.448
that you could do without.

34:36.448 --> 34:38.185
Now [bleep] off,

that the final straw

35:11.619 --> 35:15.828
But so much more [bleep]

<i>that lamb.</i>

35:17.464 --> 35:19.434
I'm not blaming myself
for it.

Nicely cooked, the duck.

35:36.736 --> 35:38.607
Service, please.

35:38.607 --> 35:41.980
That was the best piece of meat
I've literally ever had.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.351
‐Are you good? Okay.
‐I am fantastic, thank you.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.257
The Blue Team took the W
tonight.

35:47.257 --> 35:49.762
<i>We finished service,</i>
<i>and I'm not surprised.</i>

35:49.762 --> 35:51.599
<i>Like, we're All‐Stars.</i>

35:51.599 --> 35:53.169
And I think it's finally
starting to sink in

35:53.169 --> 35:55.507
to the Red Team where
the [bleep] they actually are.

35:55.507 --> 35:57.310
‐(indistinct), yes?
‐Yes, Chef.

35:57.310 --> 35:58.179
Yes, Chef.

36:04.024 --> 36:06.763
Everybody [bleep] up
in some way our rhythm.

36:06.763 --> 36:08.633
I mean, you see
how much [bleep] fish‐‐

36:08.633 --> 36:11.438
I fillet fish [bleep]
more than anything.

36:11.438 --> 36:13.710
Scott, you were lost.
You know what I mean?

36:13.710 --> 36:16.649
<i>From the jump, Scott,</i>
<i>he was in the twilight zone.</i>

36:16.649 --> 36:18.587
Man, I don't know where
his head was at.

36:18.587 --> 36:22.227
I let the team down.
I know it.

36:22.227 --> 36:24.665
Damn, you don't even sound
like you wanna be here.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.803
No, I...I‐I let the team down.

36:26.803 --> 36:28.138
‐He's honest.
‐I know.

36:28.138 --> 36:29.709
<i>SCOTT: Own up to your mistakes.</i>

36:29.709 --> 36:31.913
<i>I own up to mine.</i>

36:31.913 --> 36:33.249
<i>But I am gonna</i>
<i>prove that</i>

36:33.249 --> 36:34.986
there is a reason
why I'm here.

36:34.986 --> 36:36.623
So Scott is number one.

36:36.623 --> 36:38.727
We have to pick
one more person.

36:41.131 --> 36:42.601
Fish station was
the biggest problem.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.004
Let's go fish dish.

36:45.206 --> 36:47.912
Clearly, fish station is the
weakest station tonight.

36:47.912 --> 36:50.249
<i>Scott and Jose, they had</i>
<i>the most problems,</i>

36:50.249 --> 36:51.786
and they were
all over the place.

36:51.786 --> 36:54.190
I think Jose is extremely
strong.

36:54.190 --> 36:56.996
However, he did mess up
on a lot of the fish.

36:56.996 --> 36:59.367
‐I agree, unfortunately.
‐I did [bleep] up tonight.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.204
And listen, I apologize.

37:01.204 --> 37:02.741
It was very confusing
in the beginning.

37:02.741 --> 37:04.845
At the end of the day,
two stations were the ones

37:04.845 --> 37:06.849
who [bleep] up:
Fish and me.

37:08.218 --> 37:10.857
Yeah, so, like,
whoever was in charge of meat

37:10.857 --> 37:12.895
needs to step up and own it
because that was

37:12.895 --> 37:14.966
the communication
that broke down.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.070
Chris, I nominate you.

37:17.070 --> 37:20.276
I‐I must have asked,
like, ten times‐‐

37:20.276 --> 37:22.681
‐Yes, three solid times.
‐I need an all day.

37:22.681 --> 37:24.585
I forgot, Mia, your only job
is to cook the meat,

37:24.585 --> 37:26.254
<i>not even listen to the order,</i>
<i>right?</i>

37:26.254 --> 37:28.626
Are you kidding me?
Like, [bleep] you.

37:28.626 --> 37:31.098
I don't think he had to keep up
all the tickets solely.

37:31.098 --> 37:32.735
I think both of y'all should
have.

37:32.735 --> 37:35.640
Man, we gotta cut the [bleep],
man.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.443
The reality is if we don't
pick two people, it's gon'

37:37.443 --> 37:39.247
get real [bleep] ugly.
‐Yeah.

37:39.247 --> 37:40.951
So who's going up?

37:40.951 --> 37:42.554
Roll the dice.

37:42.554 --> 37:44.190
Yeah.

37:44.190 --> 37:45.761
One of us is going home.

first nomination and why.

38:07.470 --> 38:10.009
Scott is the first nominee,
Chef.

38:11.746 --> 38:13.983
He just couldn't handle it.

38:13.983 --> 38:16.388
And that was one of our
downfalls.

38:16.388 --> 38:17.591
One of many.

38:19.127 --> 38:22.500
Red Team's second nominee
and why.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.672
Our second nominee is...

38:28.112 --> 38:30.416
Chris, Chef.

38:30.416 --> 38:34.124
He wasn't doing enough
at the meat station,

38:34.124 --> 38:36.762
and once the meat started
dragging,

38:36.762 --> 38:39.134
then it was hard for Jose.

38:39.134 --> 38:40.670
[sighs]

38:40.670 --> 38:41.739
Wow.

Today, I started off slow.

39:38.987 --> 39:40.322
I was working with a team
on communication,

39:40.322 --> 39:41.726
trying to, like, see
where we'll all at.

39:41.726 --> 39:43.262

got mixed up,

40:08.546 --> 40:11.484

got in an accident last year.

40:11.484 --> 40:13.322
‐My mind is not the same‐‐
‐You got a what?

40:13.322 --> 40:15.994
I got into an accident, I broke
90% of my face last April.

40:15.994 --> 40:17.496
And I got a concussion.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.706
And so that's my biggest
struggle,

40:21.706 --> 40:23.308
is trying
to, like, remember things.

40:23.308 --> 40:25.379
You know, it's something that‐‐
it's a challenge.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.483
‐Do you have fire in your belly?
‐Yes, Chef.

40:27.483 --> 40:28.986
I feel like I'm behind the curve
on some things,

40:28.986 --> 40:30.824
but I have so much fire
in my [bleep] soul.

40:30.824 --> 40:32.828
I got so much fire left in me.

40:32.828 --> 40:37.069
Right, so, I'm sorry about the
accident, but fight back.

40:37.069 --> 40:38.506
Yes, Chef.

40:40.744 --> 40:42.113
My decision is...

40:46.221 --> 40:48.893
Jose and Chris.

40:50.362 --> 40:52.199
[bleep] off back in line.

Scott, come here.

40:57.878 --> 40:59.815
Let me tell you something.

40:59.815 --> 41:01.752
You did something tonight

41:01.752 --> 41:03.488
I've never seen before.

41:03.488 --> 41:08.365
You were cooking the tableside
dish in the kitchen.

41:08.365 --> 41:09.868
