00:00.501 --> 00:03.125
Previously on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht..."

00:03.125 --> 00:05.000
You want to set up
like the bar station?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.959
Gabriella is
not my boss. Sit down.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.167
Yeah, I don't like
this either.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.000
I've gotten better food
at the ballpark.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.375
The tip comes to
6500 dollars.

00:15.375 --> 00:19.584
They can take that tip
and shove it up their hole.

00:19.584 --> 00:29.918
-Oh, sh--.
-Oh, sh--.

00:29.918 --> 00:32.250
-You.
-No. [bleep] no.

00:32.250 --> 00:37.083
Get the hell away from me!

00:37.083 --> 00:38.918
-Mwah.
-Aw...

00:38.918 --> 00:41.626
Gary's signals are telling me
that he's not really interested.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.083
Oh!

00:43.083 --> 00:44.792
I'm going to have a good
time no matter what.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.709
Yes.

00:46.709 --> 01:19.834
The Master?

01:19.834 --> 01:23.417
[moaning]

01:23.417 --> 01:39.250
[bleep]

01:39.250 --> 01:45.250
What the hell
is going on here?

01:45.250 --> 01:52.667
What kind of bizarre
universe am I in right now?

01:52.667 --> 01:55.667
This is either going to improve
Gary and Daisy's relationship

01:55.667 --> 02:12.250
or the rest of this charter
season is going to sh--.

02:12.250 --> 02:24.459
Good night, good night,
good night, have fun.

02:24.459 --> 02:44.709
How the [bleep]
did that happen? Jesus.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.375
Tom isn't so bad.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.083
I wrote him off
in the beginning,

02:48.083 --> 03:00.667
but I gotta say he doesn't act
like a 23 year old in bed.

03:00.667 --> 03:23.709
Oh, dear! [bleep] Bro!

03:23.709 --> 03:24.792
[alarm sounds]

03:24.792 --> 03:39.334
Oh, sh--.

03:39.334 --> 03:41.083
The hairs are starting
to grow back.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.792
Yeah? Oh, nice.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.167
Good morning, Glenn.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.584
Hey, dude, did you
have fun last night?

03:45.584 --> 03:48.792
-Yeah, it was a good night.
-Oh... [bleep]

03:48.792 --> 03:49.792
How was your night?

03:49.792 --> 03:53.334
Everyone was pretty wasted.

03:53.334 --> 03:57.834
[bleep] off,
you're such a liar.

03:57.834 --> 04:01.042
We... everyone was there.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.000
It was just me and him?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.667
That's a lie.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.167
I swear to God you guys were
like making out in the jacuzzi.

04:07.167 --> 04:08.834
And then I came back
down the stairs.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.167
Stop.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.792
What time did you get
to bed last night?

04:12.792 --> 04:13.959
Snuck into the master.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.375
So you got lucky last night.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.584
Hope you're not annoyed.

04:16.584 --> 04:17.417
No, [bleep] it.

04:17.417 --> 04:19.250
I ended up kissing Daisy
in the Jacuzzi.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.417
-Did you enjoy it?
-It was pretty passionate.

04:21.417 --> 04:25.459
We're like crawling around
the Jacuzzi.

04:25.459 --> 04:26.751
[clicks tongue]

04:26.751 --> 04:29.459
Gary and Daisy.
Gaisy.

04:29.459 --> 04:32.083
That is ----ing funny, though.
Oh my Lord.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.834
My goal is to have
the whole boat done today,

04:34.834 --> 04:35.959
Got to make the beds downstairs.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.375
And then the main saloon
is all.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.375
Should we get stuff ready
for this wash down?

04:39.375 --> 04:42.292
Yay.

04:42.292 --> 04:48.167
-How's it going?
-I don't know.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.375
I think you shouldn't worry.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.876
Gary and Daisy
had a little smooch.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.501
Oh God.

04:54.501 --> 04:55.167
What?

04:55.167 --> 04:58.125
-Morning, Dais.
-Morning.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.167
Ha, there she is!

05:00.167 --> 05:02.751
What are you asking
if he's seen me?

05:02.751 --> 05:05.167
Dais, we were like rolling
around in the Jacuzzi.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.375
No, stop.
No, we didn't.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.876
Dais, you were on top of me.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.167
No! Stop!

05:10.167 --> 05:11.834
I thought it was
quite passionate, to be honest.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.250
I ----ing told you!

05:13.250 --> 05:15.209
I'm not going to lie
about kissing someone.

05:15.209 --> 05:16.792
We definitely kissed.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.626
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.125
I want to die.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.209
Was it long?
No, it can't have been.

05:23.209 --> 05:24.959
It was like a second.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.125
Well, you obviously
kissed me.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.083
No, other way around.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.125
Stop, I don't want to hear!

05:30.125 --> 05:31.209
I was like, hold my hands,

05:31.209 --> 05:34.125
I was like, Daisy, heal me!

05:34.125 --> 05:35.542
Oh my God.

05:35.542 --> 05:38.375
I'm never drinking
like that again.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.834
-How was your night?
-We just ----ing banged.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.959
-That was about it.
-You did?

05:42.959 --> 05:45.918
How did I miss
all of these fun times?

05:45.918 --> 05:47.876
Well, not that I wanted to join.

05:47.876 --> 05:50.083
I just mean...

05:50.083 --> 05:52.584
Yeah.
Come on in next time.

05:52.584 --> 05:56.209
Gary, Daisy and Marcos,
can you guys meet me

05:56.209 --> 05:58.501
in the crew mess for a
preference sheet meeting?

05:58.501 --> 05:59.292
Copy.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.709
Gary kissed daisy
in the hot tub.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.000
Geez, did I kiss anyone?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.709
Okay, number three.
Here we go!

06:06.709 --> 06:09.959
James Cox, Jr. from New Jersey,
Primary Charter guest.

06:09.959 --> 06:13.375
James is a luxury real estate
broker in the Manhattan area.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.751
He has sailed all over the world

06:14.751 --> 06:16.584
and eaten at some of
the best restaurants,

06:16.584 --> 06:19.834
so is excited to see what a
yacht chef and crew can do.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.167
Okay, that's a challenge,
I think we're up to.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.959
Joining James Jr. are
his sister Kimber

06:25.959 --> 06:27.542
and her BFF Bunny.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.584
James Jr.'s
little brother, Tyler

06:29.584 --> 06:31.626
and James Sr.
will be joining as well.

06:31.626 --> 06:33.042
For dinner on night one,

06:33.042 --> 06:35.167
James Jr. would like the
yacht crew to organize

06:35.167 --> 06:42.167
a 007 75th birthday dinner
for his father, Jim.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.876
I'm going to have to make
a birthday cake.

06:43.876 --> 06:45.375
-Yeah.
-On day two,

06:45.375 --> 06:48.375
they want a beach picnic
where they can play badminton

06:48.375 --> 06:49.209
Game on.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.459
For dinner, they would
like to have

06:50.459 --> 06:52.209
an authentic Spanish dinner.

06:52.209 --> 06:54.375
I'm going to try to impress
them a little bit more,

06:54.375 --> 06:57.250
you know, trying to
work with local dishes.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.250
So usually
Spanish dishes are made

06:59.250 --> 07:02.834
by seafood, spices and
the flavors are incredible.

07:02.834 --> 07:05.459
But there's so many prep,
so many cuts,

07:05.459 --> 07:08.375
you know, so many hours
cooking on the same pot.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.542
That means a lot of time
in the kitchen.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.501
You know, I'm going to make
a feast. Spanish feast.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.667
-Cool.
-Yeah, that sounds fun.

07:16.667 --> 07:27.542
All righty.

07:27.542 --> 07:28.751
Are we're ready to move on?

07:28.751 --> 07:30.375
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.792
This is Daisy calling
from Sailing Yacht Parsifal.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.375
So for this charter,

07:35.375 --> 07:38.250
I need black and
silver decorations,

07:38.250 --> 07:43.042
flamenco and lots of red dÃ©cor.

07:43.042 --> 07:48.626
Okay, appreciate it.

07:48.626 --> 07:49.584
Come on.

07:49.584 --> 07:52.542
If one twin cabin has
the hospital corners

07:52.542 --> 07:54.584
angle facing away
from the door

07:54.584 --> 07:56.459
and then across the hall,
the other cabin

07:56.459 --> 07:58.167
has them facing
towards the door,

07:58.167 --> 08:00.167
it's not going to look like
we know what we're doing.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.584
It's not going to be uniform.
This should be common sense.

08:02.584 --> 08:06.667
If you have some experience,
this is a no brainer.

08:06.667 --> 08:10.083
[phone vibrates]

08:10.083 --> 08:13.375
I'm alright, how are you?

08:13.375 --> 08:15.959
Sh--.

08:15.959 --> 08:19.751
So what are they saying,
is he going to be all right?

08:19.751 --> 08:22.334
My best friend's dad,
he collapsed

08:22.334 --> 08:25.292
the other day and is on life
support in the hospital.

08:25.292 --> 08:27.167
It's shocking and devastating.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.542
Obviously,
I'm really close to them

08:28.542 --> 08:30.959
and it's like a second
family to me.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.667
There's still some hope.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.918
But when you put it all
together, you know, it's not...

08:35.918 --> 08:36.959
It's not good.

08:36.959 --> 08:36.959
Cheers, mate.
Bye-bye.

08:36.959 --> 08:54.375
Previously on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht..."

08:54.375 --> 08:58.834
Do you need help?

08:58.834 --> 09:03.959
Sweet.

09:03.959 --> 09:07.042
I think that's us pretty
much good for the day.

09:07.042 --> 09:09.584
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:09.584 --> 09:10.751
Are you okay?

09:10.751 --> 09:17.792
It's just, uh, my best mate's
dad is in a coma.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.125
-The dad?
-Yeah.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.125
I'm sorry.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.959
Before I came to the boat,

09:22.959 --> 09:25.626
I dropped my car off
at their house.

09:25.626 --> 09:47.250
You know, he wished me
luck, and that--

09:47.250 --> 09:51.584
All right, I'm going to bed.

09:51.584 --> 09:55.959
Good night.

09:55.959 --> 10:11.667
[bleep]

10:11.667 --> 10:26.584
[alarm sounds]

10:26.584 --> 10:28.792
-Captain?
-How you doing, mate?

10:28.792 --> 10:30.292
No, I've had better days.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.042
What's going on?

10:32.042 --> 10:35.125
My best friend's dad, he's got
blood clots in his brain,

10:35.125 --> 10:36.834
and it's not looking good.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.584
-How old?
-Early '50s.

10:38.584 --> 10:40.834
Do you think you need
to go there,

10:40.834 --> 10:41.959
or do you need some time to--

10:41.959 --> 10:43.626
I'm--no, I need
to be here now.

10:43.626 --> 10:45.792
I'm gonna have a good charter,
I'm gonna smash it out.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.459
-Hope for the best.
-Yeah.

10:47.459 --> 10:49.834
-Just keep me posted.
-I will do.

10:49.834 --> 10:50.959
All right?

10:50.959 --> 10:53.584
Okay, so, plan for the day.

10:53.584 --> 10:55.709
You know, final vacuum,
make the master,

10:55.709 --> 10:57.876
all the little things
you had on your list.

10:57.876 --> 11:00.626
I'm gonna crack on with laundry.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.083
Deck team, deck team...

11:03.083 --> 11:06.876
Copy from the deck team.

11:06.876 --> 11:20.167
-What's that?
-An awning.

11:20.167 --> 11:27.167
No, not yet.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.375
How's this thing working?

11:28.375 --> 11:29.959
This will cool
the whole boat down.

11:29.959 --> 11:36.167
[bleep] yeah.

11:36.167 --> 11:40.626
Why, what's going on?

11:40.626 --> 11:41.959
It's like, I get it.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.209
I have no problem
respecting you at all.

11:43.209 --> 11:47.209
You lead the way
I wanna be lead.

11:47.209 --> 11:54.959
It's the way, like,
it's conveyed.

11:54.959 --> 11:58.375
The second stew is entitled
to delegate the third stew.

11:58.375 --> 12:02.792
That's just
a normal thing to do.

12:02.792 --> 12:04.792
You know when you have
a 12-year-old kid

12:04.792 --> 12:06.751
and they think they're 18
and they wanna wear

12:06.751 --> 12:08.792
the short dress and they
wanna wear the heels,

12:08.792 --> 12:10.751
and you're trying
to explain you're 12,

12:10.751 --> 12:13.125
and they keep coming back going,
I'm an adult--

12:13.125 --> 12:17.334
it's exactly what
Ashley reminds me of.

12:17.334 --> 12:22.125
I'll speak to you
both after the charter.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.876
All crew, all crew,
provisions are here.

12:24.876 --> 12:25.876
Copy.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.918
Langosta.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.209
-Cheese.
-Yep.

12:29.209 --> 12:33.792
I'm not ready for this
hot Spanish sun.

12:33.792 --> 12:34.834
-Oh!
-Ooh, you all right?

12:34.834 --> 12:36.709
Yeah.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.584
-Is that everything?
-That's it!

12:38.584 --> 12:41.751
All crew, all crew, guests are
gonna be here in half an hour.

12:41.751 --> 12:43.709
It's a race against
the clock now.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.626
I'm gonna go for
a little quick walkaround.

12:45.626 --> 12:52.709
Cockpit, scuppers.

12:52.709 --> 12:55.417
Okay, Well, it looks good.

12:55.417 --> 13:04.709
Whew, it's nice and cool
in here, actually, [bleep].

13:04.709 --> 13:09.209
All crew, let's get everybody
in the cockpit in three minutes.

13:09.209 --> 13:10.959
Ready to rock and roll,
charter number three.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.959
Okay.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.042
This is what we're going on.

13:15.042 --> 13:16.959
It's beautiful.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.167
No, I'm not.

13:18.167 --> 13:20.083
You floss your hair
with your teeth?

13:20.083 --> 13:21.292
-You're--you're--wait--
-Oh, my God, no, you didn't.

13:21.292 --> 13:22.834
--your teeth with your hair?

13:22.834 --> 13:28.709
-Wait, your hair with your--
-Kelsie, that is so nasty.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.167
-You like that?
-Yeah.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.375
How you doing?

13:31.375 --> 13:32.459
-Good, how you guys doing?
-Hi.

13:32.459 --> 13:33.667
Good, it's nice to see you.

13:33.667 --> 13:34.375
I'm Captain Glenn.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.959
I'm James Cox, nice to meet you.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.667
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Daisy.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.167
Hi, Daisy, it's a pleasure to
meet you, thank you so much.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.375
James Sr., how you know doing?

13:40.375 --> 13:41.584
Just kick your shoes
off at the top.

13:41.584 --> 13:42.834
Action.

13:42.834 --> 13:44.167
-How you doing?
-Ashley.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.334
-Thank you so much.
-Tom, nice to meet you.

13:45.334 --> 13:46.584
I'm James, nice to meet you.

13:46.584 --> 13:48.584
Hayden, nice to meet you--
thank you.

13:48.584 --> 13:50.792
-Colin, nice to meet you.
-Hi, Bunny, nice to meet you.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.959
-Hello, I'm Kelsie.
-Tyler, nice to meet you.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.334
Nice to meet you as well.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.918
Welcome to Parsifal III.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.876
We've got a lot of fun stuff
planned for you guys.

13:57.876 --> 14:00.709
Daisy's gonna take you guys on
a little tour around the boat,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.375
and we'll get ready
to get outta here.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.584
-Awesome.
-Great, thank you so much.

14:03.584 --> 14:05.918
-Welcome aboard.
-This is the cockpit.

14:05.918 --> 14:07.959
So, this is where you'll be
eating most of your meals.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.834
Follow me up the stairs.

14:09.834 --> 14:17.167
Up here, we have flybridge.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.167
Here we've got main saloon,

14:19.167 --> 14:20.959
nice to come down here,
get out of the sun.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.334
Obviously, behind you
we have the bar.

14:23.334 --> 14:25.792
I want my wine for sure.

14:25.792 --> 14:28.167
If we go down here,
so, this is the master.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.792
Oh, this is lovely!

14:29.792 --> 14:32.250
And then in here we've
got the two twins as well.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.459
-They're identical.
-We'll let Bunny decide.

14:34.459 --> 14:36.167
You'll find some
difference between the two

14:36.167 --> 14:38.209
that makes a difference to you.

14:38.209 --> 14:39.959
Okay, guys, we're ready to go.

14:39.959 --> 14:44.584
You can get the lines off
in whatever order you like.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.250
Do it...

14:46.250 --> 14:47.584
That's all lines off, yeah?

14:47.584 --> 14:53.542
All lines clear.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.292
Go to bed, Tom.

14:55.292 --> 14:57.125
That's adorable.
Thank you.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.876
-"Adorable?" Come on, Kim.
-I don't know.

14:58.876 --> 15:01.375
-Daddy's not adorable.
-That's not adorable.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.542
-That's good.
-That is adorable!

15:04.542 --> 15:06.501
Have you decided on
your menu for dinner?

15:06.501 --> 15:10.250
Yeah, lobster bisque,
beef tenderloin.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.542
You're working nights
or mornings?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.083
-I'm working nights.
-Nights?

15:13.083 --> 15:15.083
Yeah.
We're alternating.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.125
I work days and nights.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.959
Twenty-four-seven.

15:20.959 --> 15:22.876
You know, right now it's,
like, five knots.

15:22.876 --> 15:25.083
We need more, like,
eight, nine, 10.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.250
Got it.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.334
So, I have to ask
you a question:

15:27.334 --> 15:28.959
what's your favorite animal?

15:28.959 --> 15:30.334
Well, I'm a dog guy.

15:30.334 --> 15:31.959
-What about cougars?
-Cougars?

15:31.959 --> 15:33.667
Yeah.

15:33.667 --> 15:34.959
-Yeah, I don't mind cougars.
-You don't mind 'em?

15:34.959 --> 15:37.167
-No.
-Seriously?

15:37.167 --> 15:39.501
James! Stop!

15:39.501 --> 15:43.167
They run fast, and...
and they're old.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.792
Gary, Gary, Glenn, all right,
I'm gonna slow right down.

15:45.792 --> 15:49.959
-You gonna do the anchor?
-I'll do the anchor, yeah.

15:49.959 --> 15:56.209
Let it go.

15:56.209 --> 15:57.417
That looks good.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.375
Oh, my, look at this water.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.626
[bleep] this is like
a swimming pool.

16:02.626 --> 16:04.000
Down on the frame.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.542
Swim platform down.

16:05.542 --> 16:06.876
Were you doing laundry
or something?

16:06.876 --> 16:07.918
Yeah.

16:07.918 --> 16:10.584
I already flipped the laundry.

16:10.584 --> 16:15.000
Let's focus on putting
all this stuff back.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.501
Come on.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.584
How's... did you talk to them?

16:18.584 --> 16:20.501
-Ashley and Gabriela?
-Yeah.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.501
Well, I thought I made it
obvious at the tip meeting.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.209
I was like, ee!

16:25.209 --> 16:29.584
I want to remind everyone
that we're a team...

16:29.584 --> 16:31.209
Yes.

16:31.209 --> 16:32.959
...and to work with each
other respectfully.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.751
They were at it again today.

16:34.751 --> 16:36.667
I think the egos are getting...

16:36.667 --> 16:38.834
Exactly, that's all
that it is.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.792
Daisy, you need
to control this.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.542
It's not right, because it
will affect everyone else.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.334
I mean, they're ----ing good
at their jobs.

16:46.334 --> 16:49.667
Glad that I'm busy
in the galley, right?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.167
I have my own problems.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.751
I'm gonna sit down with
them after the charter?

16:53.751 --> 16:54.959
-After?
-Yeah.

16:54.959 --> 16:57.167
Oh, God.

16:57.167 --> 16:58.501
Coming up...

16:58.501 --> 17:00.584
We also have a small
surprise for Bunny.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.792
The cougar really wants some
dad bods to deliver her cake?

17:03.792 --> 17:05.542
Who are we to let her down?

17:05.542 --> 17:07.083
Here we go.

17:07.083 --> 17:18.125
Oh, my God!

17:18.125 --> 17:20.959
Remember there's seven
of them, yeah?

17:20.959 --> 17:21.918
Glenn's sitting with them.

17:21.918 --> 17:23.042
For sure.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.959
See, I forget what I'm doing.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.334
Would you like some more wine?

17:26.334 --> 17:28.042
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

17:28.042 --> 17:30.709
Ah, bitch, leave me alone!

17:30.709 --> 17:32.751
Ah! Ah!

17:32.751 --> 17:34.876
The guests are asking
for local flavors,

17:34.876 --> 17:38.042
and that's what
they're gonna get.

17:38.042 --> 17:40.792
The reason why I'm making
the lobster bisque so early

17:40.792 --> 17:44.459
is because I want those flavors
to intensify in the broth.

17:44.459 --> 17:48.292
I make it look easy,
but definitely it's not.

17:48.292 --> 17:56.792
Payback, I got it.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.584
Yeah, man.

17:59.584 --> 18:00.792
Yeah, it's a little bit of wine.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.250
Just shut your mouth, you minor.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.542
-Gabriela?
-Yeah.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.459
Ashley can do dinner service
with me tonight,

18:05.459 --> 18:06.501
and then you can do
tomorrow night.

18:06.501 --> 18:08.959
You can go down and do cabins.

18:08.959 --> 18:12.959
Sweet.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.709
Do you need a hand there?

18:15.709 --> 18:17.250
You're looking at him
like you're ready

18:17.250 --> 18:18.792
to make out with him again.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.584
Oh [bleep] off, Kelsie.

18:20.584 --> 18:24.167
Honey, you were in bed,
you don't even know.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.167
I think Daisy's
got a crush on me.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.042
A little one.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.751
[laughing]

18:29.751 --> 18:31.042
Oh, my gosh.

18:31.042 --> 18:32.834
I was pretty much drowning,

18:32.834 --> 18:34.375
and you, like,
grabbed me up...

18:34.375 --> 18:35.876
That's such a lie.

18:35.876 --> 18:37.709
I did.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.375
Come here.

18:39.375 --> 18:42.083
I'm greasy, and there's
glitter on my face.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.751
Yeah.

18:44.751 --> 18:47.918
Yeah, I just feel bad
for them, but I'm fine.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.751
-Yeah.
-Sucks.

18:49.751 --> 18:52.292
I really just need
to be supportive.

18:52.292 --> 18:54.083
When something like
this happens,

18:54.083 --> 18:57.501
it's gonna be there constantly
in the back of your mind,

18:57.501 --> 19:01.542
which is gonna make your job
harder than it already is.

19:01.542 --> 19:04.751
I'm sorry.
Want some ice cream?

19:04.751 --> 19:07.959
[laughing]

19:07.959 --> 19:10.501
I think...

19:10.501 --> 19:15.501
you should all serve
dessert topless for Bunny.

19:15.501 --> 19:18.042
-To Bunny?
-We're out of shape.

19:18.042 --> 19:19.834
I'm very out of shape.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.417
Do you want me to
show you my body first,

19:21.417 --> 19:22.959
and then you be the judge?

19:22.959 --> 19:24.292
[laughing]

19:24.292 --> 19:26.000
Because I think
it's gonna be a hard no.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.918
-All right, are you ready?
-Me, I've been ready.

19:27.918 --> 19:33.292
-You were born ready?
-Yeah.

19:33.292 --> 19:34.709
Do you like the wine?

19:34.709 --> 19:35.501
Yes.

19:35.501 --> 19:38.083
-Yeah, red, white, blue?
-Anything.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.209
I'm king of the world!
[laughs]

19:40.209 --> 19:41.834
That all looks very nice.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.626
Oh, my God, I love this dÃ©cor.

19:44.626 --> 19:46.042
You're welcome.

19:46.042 --> 19:49.584
-Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
-Hey, Glenn.

19:49.584 --> 19:51.167
-Thanks for inviting me.
-Appreciate it.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.792
I hope it's good.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.209
Me too.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.292
We're ready whenever you are.

19:57.292 --> 20:00.375
You can go. Careful.

20:00.375 --> 20:04.792
-Happy birthday.
-So, happy birthday, Dad.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.626
We have a lobster bisque
with Majorcan lobster,

20:07.626 --> 20:11.167
and I put a toast point on
top with a Sriracha aioli.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.375
Very nice.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.626
Wow.

20:13.626 --> 20:16.959
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

20:16.959 --> 20:17.959
That's awesome.

20:17.959 --> 20:19.000
Okay, what next, Chef?

20:19.000 --> 20:23.167
Beef tenderloin.

20:23.167 --> 20:24.709
Are you all finished?

20:24.709 --> 20:26.584
Yeah, thank you.

20:26.584 --> 20:29.083
-Do you want a glass of water?
-Mm-mmm.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.792
-He's fine.
-All right.

20:31.792 --> 20:36.751
Okay, the starter's cleared.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.751
So, do you think we'll
have some wind tomorrow?

20:38.751 --> 20:40.125
Yeah, we'll have
a good sail tomorrow.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.292
Yeah? Cool.

20:41.292 --> 20:42.667
I wanna go as long as we can,

20:42.667 --> 20:46.250
and I wanna make Marcos,
like, tip sideways.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.584
-Why are you being nice?
-I'm very nice.

20:48.584 --> 20:49.751
Okay.

20:49.751 --> 20:51.542
Daisy, just because you
kissed me once doesn't mean

20:51.542 --> 20:54.584
you can't ----ing...
"why am I being nice?"

20:54.584 --> 20:59.959
Let's go!

20:59.959 --> 21:04.209
So, this one
is a beef tenderloin.

21:04.209 --> 21:06.209
And then I put the potatoes
from Mallorca

21:06.209 --> 21:09.125
with eggplant, very famous
here on the island.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.667
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you so much.

21:11.667 --> 21:12.876
This is delicious.

21:12.876 --> 21:14.834
It's so tasty.

21:14.834 --> 21:17.501
How's your steak, buddy?

21:17.501 --> 21:22.667
-He's taking a nap.
-He is taking a nap.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.918
He's snoring.

21:24.918 --> 21:27.375
All right--
My baby brother.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.709
What do you think, Captain?

21:28.709 --> 21:32.375
-I think he's fine.
-He's snoring.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.709
-No.
-We'll prop you up.

21:34.709 --> 21:40.501
What is this, like,
Weekend at Parsifal?

21:40.501 --> 21:42.042
Tyler loved his.

21:42.042 --> 21:44.584
Baby brother.

21:44.584 --> 21:49.125
Okay, we're ready
for the cake.

21:49.125 --> 21:50.959
âª Happy birthday to you

21:50.959 --> 21:53.375
Oh, Marcos!

21:53.375 --> 21:57.584
âª Happy birthday to you

21:57.584 --> 22:02.375
âª Happy birthday, dear James

22:02.375 --> 22:06.959
âª Happy birthday to you

22:06.959 --> 22:10.125
-Woo!
-Yay!

22:10.125 --> 22:12.292
Happy birthday, Dad.

22:12.292 --> 22:13.667
Thank you, James.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.501
So, our T-shirts are
coming off now, correct?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.959
Yeah, but you're only
serving Bunny.

22:16.959 --> 22:18.876
Don't be a creep
to anything else.

22:18.876 --> 22:21.751
I need to do some push-ups.

22:21.751 --> 22:23.000
-Okay.
-Right.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.542
Can I put smiley faces
on my nipples?

22:25.542 --> 22:28.626
We also have a small surprise
for Bunny as well.

22:28.626 --> 22:30.167
Oh, God!

22:30.167 --> 22:31.709
Here we go!

22:31.709 --> 22:35.000
Oh, my God!

22:35.000 --> 22:37.334
Oh, my [bleep]

22:37.334 --> 22:39.626
I want a picture with them.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.542
Look, if the cougar really
wants some dad bods

22:42.542 --> 22:45.375
to deliver her cake,
who are we to let her down?

22:45.375 --> 22:48.083
-Thank you, guys!
-Thank you!

22:48.083 --> 22:50.918
That's hilarious.

22:50.918 --> 22:54.209
[snoring]

22:54.209 --> 22:55.584
Coming up...

22:55.584 --> 22:56.918
Just put your foot
on the bottom...

22:56.918 --> 22:58.375
-Yeah.
-...and then push up.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.167
-They're right there.
-Oh, sh--.

23:00.167 --> 23:01.250
I'm so embarrassed.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.876
There can at least
be a tablecloth.

23:02.876 --> 23:04.375
Our little bar could
have been set up.

23:04.375 --> 23:05.959
You guys don't move fast enough.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.375
Tom did this by himself.

23:07.375 --> 23:07.375
All right, we don't
need attitude.

23:07.375 --> 23:14.459
Remember there's seven
of them, yeah?

23:14.459 --> 23:16.167
Thank you all for doing that.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.584
Thank you very much for dinner.

23:17.584 --> 23:22.876
-Thank you.
-That was a lot of fun.

23:22.876 --> 23:25.375
Hello!

23:25.375 --> 23:26.792
-Come here.
-Stop!

23:26.792 --> 23:28.501
When you talk to Gary
and Daisy individually,

23:28.501 --> 23:30.792
they'll tell you they basically
hate the other person.

23:30.792 --> 23:32.501
Mm!

23:32.501 --> 23:34.209
But then when they're together,

23:34.209 --> 23:38.250
there's this connection between
them that they can't resist.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.083
'Cause I can overhear her
talking about you boys.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.959
That's why I knew
she'd like it.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.334
It's getting wild.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.584
She's obviously single.

23:45.584 --> 23:47.209
I'm trying to get him going.

23:47.209 --> 23:50.167
Whoa, don't let him
slide under that table.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.292
Come on, Ty.

23:51.292 --> 23:52.792
-[snoring]
-Tyler.

23:52.792 --> 23:54.751
Second wind, let's go.
We're gonna go.

23:54.751 --> 23:56.334
He can lay down
there for a little.

23:56.334 --> 23:57.834
We're not gonna leave
him here, are we?

23:57.834 --> 24:00.459
I'll have the boys help
him down in a little bit.

24:00.459 --> 24:03.501
That was a fun date, Tyler.

24:03.501 --> 24:05.167
Glad you had so much fun.

24:05.167 --> 24:07.083
It's hilarious.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.918
Jesus.

24:09.918 --> 24:11.083
Oh, it's so good.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.250
You can go to bed.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.584
Yes, Mom.

24:13.584 --> 24:16.000
Can we help you set
the table for breakfast?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.959
I would be happy to.

24:17.959 --> 24:19.959
My sister's really good
with table dÃ©cor.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.042
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.417
Yeah.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.083
You should come over for
Thanksgiving some year.

24:25.083 --> 24:31.834
I will.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.626
Pulse checked, he is...

24:33.626 --> 24:35.083
he's very drunk.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.501
Hey, buddy.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.375
Tyler.

24:38.375 --> 24:40.584
-Hey, buddy.
-Tyler.

24:40.584 --> 24:42.334
We need to get you down
to your cabin.

24:42.334 --> 24:46.042
This guy is ----ing
wasted right now.

24:46.042 --> 24:49.375
Tyler.

24:49.375 --> 24:50.375
Tyler, you gotta get up.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.709
That's how you do it.

24:51.709 --> 24:54.417
Tyler, get up, buddy.

24:54.417 --> 24:55.709
It's kinda hilarious.

24:55.709 --> 24:59.083
-Get under there.
-Come on.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.375
Tyler, you gotta stand up.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.167
But such a bad idea.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.042
Next thing you know,
he's in the water, overboard.

25:05.042 --> 25:06.501
-Night-night.
-Mwah.

25:06.501 --> 25:07.626
We'll see you in
the morning, honey.

25:07.626 --> 25:11.083
-Okay.
-Okay. See you then.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.375
What a wanker.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.584
Gotta go to the bathroom
before you sleep?

25:14.584 --> 25:17.542
-Didn't I just go?
-Nope.

25:17.542 --> 25:18.876
-Thank you.
-No problem.

25:18.876 --> 25:20.250
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.042
Good night, sleep well.

25:22.042 --> 25:25.042
You, too.

25:25.042 --> 25:26.417
Thanks, guys, good night.

25:26.417 --> 25:27.459
You're very welcome,
good night, good night.

25:27.459 --> 25:32.083
Good night, have a nice sleep.

25:32.083 --> 25:35.083
[speaking Spanish]

25:35.083 --> 25:49.834
[laughing]

25:49.834 --> 25:52.125
Night-night.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.959
-Marcos.
-Yo.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.167
Yeah, sure.

25:56.167 --> 25:57.584
Morning, Dais.

25:57.584 --> 25:59.667
-Here's your apple juice.
-Thank you.

25:59.667 --> 26:03.000
I'm making cheese plate,
cold cuts,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.083
fruit plate, crepes, apple tart.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.542
What time we
planning on leaving?

26:07.542 --> 26:08.334
About 9:30.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.125
Set up the beach picnic.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.209
I don't think we're gonna get
any sailing in this morning.

26:12.209 --> 26:13.626
No current, no breeze.

26:13.626 --> 26:15.250
There's some wind
around this afternoon.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.667
So, maybe after lunch.

26:16.667 --> 26:18.584
I think we'll just
let Dad and Tyler

26:18.584 --> 26:21.959
-sleep until they wanna wake up.
-Absolutely.

26:21.959 --> 26:23.292
-Good morning.
-Morning.

26:23.292 --> 26:24.459
-How is everyone?
-Good.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.918
What's our schedule for the day,

26:25.918 --> 26:27.792
can we sail for at
least some portion of it?

26:27.792 --> 26:29.584
At the moment, there's not
a lot of wind, unfortunately.

26:29.584 --> 26:30.834
Yeah.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.918
But we were planning on doing
a beach picnic for you today,

26:32.918 --> 26:34.959
and playing some badminton.

26:34.959 --> 26:37.584
When the guests can't get a
good sail in,

26:37.584 --> 26:40.125
it's imperative that
the interior team

26:40.125 --> 26:42.250
go above and beyond
to keep them happy

26:42.250 --> 26:45.834
and make sure that
everything goes perfectly.

26:45.834 --> 26:48.459
I ----ing hate that, ugh.

26:48.459 --> 26:51.334
And then this afternoon,
hopefully, the wind can pick up.

26:51.334 --> 26:53.042
-Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

26:53.042 --> 26:55.125
It's too bad we're not
sailing right now

26:55.125 --> 26:57.250
so Tyler would
fall out of his bed.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.918
Gary, Gary, Glenn.
Start picking up.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.459
Do you wanna take this,
and I'll get the tender.

27:01.459 --> 27:02.501
Yeah.

27:02.501 --> 27:03.959
Hey.

27:03.959 --> 27:05.626
Ashley's just down doing cabins,

27:05.626 --> 27:07.959
the rest of them are
awake except the master.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.375
Okay.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.125
Go ahead, anchor's
at the waterline.

27:11.125 --> 27:13.501
Copy that, thanks, mate.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.542
Come into the crew mess
for a second.

27:15.542 --> 27:19.000
So, as soon as
the deck are ready,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.042
we're gonna go ashore.

27:21.042 --> 27:24.250
You're doing lunch, and...

27:24.250 --> 27:25.667
I'm just bringing
over table stuff.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.209
-Just table stuff...
-Yeah.

27:27.209 --> 27:28.959
...for the moment, and set up.

27:28.959 --> 27:31.417
Then come back, get the
guests with all their drinks,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.792
and then lunch at 1:30.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.792
Okay.

27:36.792 --> 27:38.792
Perfect.

27:38.792 --> 27:42.417
Perfecto, thank you
for the communication.

27:42.417 --> 27:45.083
I need you...
yeah, you two wait... okay.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.375
Babe, babe?

27:46.375 --> 27:48.000
-She's hot, eh?
-She is hot.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.959
-No, she's pretty.
-Yeah, she's very pretty.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.501
Seeing as I can't get action
with the girls on board...

27:51.501 --> 27:52.584
And she's funny,
she's funny, too.

27:52.584 --> 27:54.000
...let me go with the guests.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.209
[bleep] how come you can't
get any action

27:55.209 --> 27:56.250
with the girls on board?

27:56.250 --> 27:57.250
Well, because Daisy kissed me.

27:57.250 --> 27:58.375
What?
What the hell?

27:58.375 --> 28:00.042
She attacked me.

28:00.042 --> 28:02.751
I like chicks that's got spunk
and that's full of life.

28:02.751 --> 28:10.959
And who's that?

28:10.959 --> 28:12.292
What?

28:12.292 --> 28:13.542
No, I'm kidding.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.167
He lives!

28:15.167 --> 28:16.417
Good morning, sunshine.

28:16.417 --> 28:17.709
How'd you sleep?

28:17.709 --> 28:19.959
Oh, my gosh, like a baby.
Apparently.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.292
So funny.

28:21.292 --> 28:22.501
I don't know what
you were drinking,

28:22.501 --> 28:24.584
you were just... [snores].

28:24.584 --> 28:25.876
Oh, I'll be having
a nap before dinner.

28:25.876 --> 28:27.125
Let go port, let go port.

28:27.125 --> 28:31.501
Watch your hands on that.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.167
That's one
and a bit shots in the water.

28:33.167 --> 28:34.417
We should be good.

28:34.417 --> 28:35.584
You guys need
some help up there?

28:35.584 --> 28:37.209
I think we got it,
thanks, though.

28:37.209 --> 28:43.250
Are you sure? I'll come and
help you, if you need it.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.876
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

28:44.876 --> 28:50.083
A little bit heavier.

28:50.083 --> 28:54.751
Yes.

28:54.751 --> 28:57.209
In case you're missing anything
in your cabin, I stowed it.

28:57.209 --> 28:59.709
What was that?

28:59.709 --> 29:01.876
Oh, my God, you weren't
supposed to see me like this.

29:01.876 --> 29:04.000
Everybody's clothes
are completely mixed up.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.626
That's it, I think.

29:06.626 --> 29:08.167
So, sandwiches for lunch, no?

29:08.167 --> 29:10.626
Three different types
for the beach.

29:10.626 --> 29:11.792
Okay. Okay.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.250
Today I'm gonna make
a light lunch,

29:13.250 --> 29:14.959
like sandwiches and salads.

29:14.959 --> 29:18.584
For me, it's a smart move
to dedicate more time

29:18.584 --> 29:20.959
to the feast
I'm gonna deliver tonight.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.501
It's like always one step ahead.

29:23.501 --> 29:24.792
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

29:24.792 --> 29:25.792
Good morning.

29:25.792 --> 29:29.959
This might be a two-person job.

29:29.959 --> 29:32.167
Ugh!

29:32.167 --> 29:35.209
Ooh, it's hot.

29:35.209 --> 29:38.667
My ass better be
----ing peachy after this.

29:38.667 --> 29:42.250
Okay, I think we're gonna need
to tag-team this tarp, too.

29:42.250 --> 29:46.250
Maybe we just walk it over?

29:46.250 --> 29:49.751
Okay, Gary's here with the
tender, if you're ready to go.

29:49.751 --> 29:50.918
Ah!

29:50.918 --> 29:52.334
I'm so sandy.

29:52.334 --> 29:54.501
Gary, Gary, some of the
guests are on their way

29:54.501 --> 29:55.959
down to the swim platform now.

29:55.959 --> 29:57.334
Is your radio up all the way,

29:57.334 --> 29:59.042
because mine's
somewhere in this mess.

29:59.042 --> 30:00.584
Oh.

30:00.584 --> 30:02.083
Well, I may take that off
you,

30:02.083 --> 30:06.125
because that's glass.

30:06.125 --> 30:08.792
Oh, it is hot as hell.

30:08.792 --> 30:09.834
Thanks, man.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.209
Can you just do a hitch on it?

30:11.209 --> 30:13.042
Yeah, but I think
we're gonna need

30:13.042 --> 30:14.959
a bit more slack
for when it raises.

30:14.959 --> 30:18.751
Bye, guys, have fun.

30:18.751 --> 30:21.918
Okay, tied right here.

30:21.918 --> 30:23.375
-Watch the road.
-I am, I am.

30:23.375 --> 30:26.209
-Keep your eyes on the road.
-Yes, boss.

30:26.209 --> 30:27.542
This thing
looks freaking silly.

30:27.542 --> 30:30.751
And how does this attach, then?

30:30.751 --> 30:32.792
Do you have more rope?

30:32.792 --> 30:36.417
Yeah, you want this, like,
in individual wrapping,

30:36.417 --> 30:38.125
or you want it on a plate?

30:38.125 --> 30:39.792
I mean, on a plate looks nicer,

30:39.792 --> 30:42.792
but maybe individually
wrapped is better.

30:42.792 --> 30:44.792
I mean, this is why
I hate beach picnics...

30:44.792 --> 30:46.792
it's never gonna
look as good as...

30:46.792 --> 30:49.542
-Yeah.
-...if you were on the boat.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.000
Just put your foot
on the bottom...

30:51.000 --> 30:52.626
-Yeah.
-...and then push up.

30:52.626 --> 30:53.792
Okay.

30:53.792 --> 30:55.083
This is insane.

30:55.083 --> 30:56.584
Whew, it was sweaty down there.

30:56.584 --> 30:58.417
It's probably gonna be
the easiest to get off

30:58.417 --> 30:59.959
the front of the boat,
off the bow.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.417
They're right there.

31:01.417 --> 31:02.584
Oh sh--.

31:02.584 --> 31:15.000
Maybe we just set up...
give 'em badminton to play?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.334
Got it?

31:17.334 --> 31:20.292
----ing cluster[bleep].

31:20.292 --> 31:21.501
I'm so embarrassed.

31:21.501 --> 31:23.375
There could at least
be a tablecloth,

31:23.375 --> 31:26.167
our little bar could have been
set up, and the chairs.

31:26.167 --> 31:27.584
You guys don't move fast enough.

31:27.584 --> 31:29.918
Okay, well, someone
needs to keep them

31:29.918 --> 31:31.417
distracted from this whole area.

31:31.417 --> 31:32.167
Yeah.

31:32.167 --> 31:33.459
Badminton'll be fun in the wind.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.709
Face away from the debauchery.

31:36.709 --> 31:40.959
Maybe we should play it under
the tent that they can't erect.

31:40.959 --> 31:48.375
If anyone wants to sit, you may.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.292
Can you just try to help us
get this tent up first?

31:50.292 --> 31:52.375
What happened?
Tom did this by himself.

31:52.375 --> 31:54.375
All right, we don't
need attitude.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.876
I just wanna be in the shade.

31:55.876 --> 31:55.876
[bleep]

31:55.876 --> 32:01.918
Thank you all for doing that.

32:01.918 --> 32:06.626
I just wanna be in the shade.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.417
All right, we don't
need attitude.

32:08.417 --> 32:10.584
Where's Tom when you need him?

32:10.584 --> 32:13.626
[grunts]

32:13.626 --> 32:15.417
-How's it going?
-It's going swimmingly.

32:15.417 --> 32:17.792
This looks awful.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.792
Pull this down.

32:20.792 --> 32:21.959
So embarrassing.

32:21.959 --> 32:23.918
Ah...

32:23.918 --> 32:27.501
Yeah.

32:27.501 --> 32:29.459
See, now, just make this neat.

32:29.459 --> 32:30.792
-Thank you.
-Can I get you a beverage?

32:30.792 --> 32:32.501
Yeah, I'll have a
bottle of wine, please.

32:32.501 --> 32:34.584
I brought an extra-large
straw for you today.

32:34.584 --> 32:35.667
Yeah, perfect.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.792
I'm mortified.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.417
Guests are standing
right there.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.083
Did you just wanna
give me a half-pour?

32:42.083 --> 32:44.250
-No, I'm just kidding.
-I didn't want it to get warm.

32:44.250 --> 32:46.375
That's what makes
me good at my job.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.501
Sorry you guys had to see
that... so, where were we?

32:48.501 --> 32:49.959
Here's some more wine.

32:49.959 --> 32:52.334
Oh, wow, guys, good job.

32:52.334 --> 32:55.667
-Okay, let's go.
-Food is on its way.

32:55.667 --> 32:56.834
Whew.

32:56.834 --> 32:58.250
So, how come
we're taking this down?

32:58.250 --> 33:00.000
Because you can't sail with it.

33:00.000 --> 33:08.375
Oh, yeah, I suppose it's like
a bit of a parachute, isn't it?

33:08.375 --> 33:09.459
-Hey.
-Yo.

33:09.459 --> 33:11.292
How is it going at the beach?

33:11.292 --> 33:13.042
Not well.

33:13.042 --> 33:18.959
Why?

33:18.959 --> 33:20.459
I thought that's what
you were supposed

33:20.459 --> 33:24.292
to be doing for this last hour.

33:24.292 --> 33:28.542
Why didn't you radio
us for help?

33:28.542 --> 33:29.375
Okay.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.709
What the [bleep]?

33:30.709 --> 33:35.501
Did they say they
needed anything else?

33:35.501 --> 33:38.209
I can't be everywhere
at the same time.

33:38.209 --> 33:39.834
I don't get paid enough
for this sh--.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.584
When you go over with this,
can you send Gabriela back?

33:42.584 --> 33:43.918
Yes.

33:43.918 --> 33:45.709
You'll help Ashley, yeah?

33:45.709 --> 33:47.167
Yeah.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.792
Gary, do you want me
to go, or...

33:48.792 --> 33:50.042
-FYI.
-Yes?

33:50.042 --> 33:51.459
As soon as the guests are back
on board, we're gonna pick up

33:51.459 --> 33:52.709
-and go, so...
-Okay.

33:52.709 --> 33:54.375
This is so nice in
the shade here.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.834
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.834
Not sitting and baking
in the sun.

33:57.834 --> 33:59.375
This is what you think
it's gonna look like,

33:59.375 --> 34:00.834
and then this is, like, reality.

34:00.834 --> 34:02.334
That's why I try
not to look at it.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.083
Look over here.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.417
Oh!

34:06.417 --> 34:08.542
-She won me over.
-Oh, yeah, you did.

34:08.542 --> 34:11.375
Welcome, Tom,
how was your morning?

34:11.375 --> 34:12.959
Ow [bleep].

34:12.959 --> 34:15.000
-Beach party.
-Ah.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.209
Next...

34:17.209 --> 34:19.626
And the food is on that boat.

34:19.626 --> 34:22.250
This is awesome,
this is beautiful.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.417
Do you take breaks?

34:23.417 --> 34:24.792
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

34:24.792 --> 34:28.792
Like, me, no, it's like
all day, din, din, din.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.959
We have roast beef, tuna,
or Caprese.

34:30.959 --> 34:32.959
Oh, I'll have the Caprese.

34:32.959 --> 34:34.417
Sure.

34:34.417 --> 34:36.834
I love tomatoes and cucumber
and feta, so good.

34:36.834 --> 34:38.501
This is really good.

34:38.501 --> 34:42.459
I feel like I'm at sixth grade
camp, opening my sandwich.

34:42.459 --> 34:45.751
-Oh, you're back.
-Yep.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.209
I heard the beach was
a sh---show.

34:47.209 --> 34:49.375
Mm-hmm. They had to watch us
struggle,

34:49.375 --> 34:51.083
trying to set up the tent.

34:51.083 --> 34:54.375
But it's done, guests are happy
and they said it looks nice.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.834
-Okay.
-We made it work.

34:55.834 --> 34:58.125
-Are you all finished?
-Oh, I am, thanks.

34:58.125 --> 34:59.626
I didn't think you were
gonna make it this morning,

34:59.626 --> 35:01.334
-I'm not gonna lie.
-Ah!

35:01.334 --> 35:04.334
Well, I thought the same of you.

35:04.334 --> 35:07.042
What's going on, bro?

35:07.042 --> 35:08.167
[bleep] these are fresh.

35:08.167 --> 35:09.167
They're still moving.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.334
Super fresh.

35:10.334 --> 35:12.751
I'm doing paella, tapas.

35:12.751 --> 35:15.375
For the main event, we're
gonna make a seafood paella

35:15.375 --> 35:18.459
with scallops,
lobster, calamari,

35:18.459 --> 35:20.000
and traditional bomba rice.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.042
It's gonna be flamenco inside
their mouth, like...

35:24.042 --> 35:26.042
-Finish it strong.
-Yeah, man.

35:26.042 --> 35:29.417
Excited to get you guys sailing.

35:29.417 --> 35:36.542
Get in, Gary,
get in, yeah, woo!

35:36.542 --> 35:39.792
Take your time, take your time.

35:39.792 --> 35:43.959
Oh, I'm so wet.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.792
Could I get a beer,
when anybody has a chance?

35:46.792 --> 35:48.792
Yeah, of course.

35:48.792 --> 35:50.083
You might make it to
the end of the night

35:50.083 --> 35:51.584
if you just drink beer.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.334
There's a little bit of breeze,

35:53.334 --> 35:54.584
so we'll get these
NautiBuoys away

35:54.584 --> 35:55.834
and we'll we're going sailing.

35:55.834 --> 36:00.584
That thing can
go straight on tow.

36:00.584 --> 36:02.959
I feel like I just
returned from war.

36:02.959 --> 36:05.334
Where is Ashley disappeared...
she keeps running off.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.751
No, she's with Tom
in the cabin?

36:06.751 --> 36:09.000
-Why?
-I'm in the laundry.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.375
[laughing]

36:10.375 --> 36:12.751
Tom, I gotta go do
the anchor and stuff.

36:12.751 --> 36:14.834
I'll get these.

36:14.834 --> 36:16.375
Are you ready for
your break, Ashley?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.542
I am very ready for my break.

36:18.542 --> 36:23.125
See you in two hours,
back in your blacks.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.584
Colin, Colin, Colin, Glenn.

36:24.584 --> 36:27.250
You can start picking
up whenever you like.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.250
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Daisy.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.250
You're welcome.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.459
Seven knots.

36:30.459 --> 36:32.792
Like, seriously,
I just wanna be sailing.

36:32.792 --> 36:35.334
So, I'm just going
to see what happens here.

36:35.334 --> 36:38.459
Listen, people come
on a sailboat to sail.

36:38.459 --> 36:43.792
You gotta try everything.

36:43.792 --> 36:45.250
Anchor's off the bottom,
anchor's off the bottom.

36:45.250 --> 36:48.292
Copy, off the bottom, thank you.

36:48.292 --> 36:51.167
Let's pair away and
get the gennie up.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.751
Showing at six knots.

36:52.751 --> 36:53.501
Sh--.

36:53.501 --> 36:56.959
We're gonna do the mizzen now.

36:56.959 --> 36:58.584
Going up.

36:58.584 --> 37:02.083
If you don't try, then you're
just a motorboat, right?

37:02.083 --> 37:03.584
You're just a motorboat.

37:03.584 --> 37:04.375
Wow.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.709
There she goes.

37:05.709 --> 37:06.751
Oh, my gosh.

37:06.751 --> 37:08.250
Okay, that's good,
let's go to the main.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.834
Going up.

37:10.834 --> 37:12.501
They're giant.

37:12.501 --> 37:14.626
Okay, that's half a wrap,
and hold.

37:14.626 --> 37:23.042
-Excellent.
-Okay, let's go.

37:23.042 --> 37:24.542
Is the motor off now?

37:24.542 --> 37:26.417
All right, so,
are you feathering?

37:26.417 --> 37:28.959
It's done, yeah.

37:28.959 --> 37:30.751
Colin, catch some wind.

37:30.751 --> 37:32.626
-I'm trying.
-The wind's died off.

37:32.626 --> 37:35.167
There was more when we were
trying to play badminton.

37:35.167 --> 37:36.375
Yeah.

37:36.375 --> 37:37.876
[blows air]

37:37.876 --> 37:39.250
It's not working.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.375
Sh--, five knots.

37:40.375 --> 37:41.959
There's no wind.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.584
[blows air]

37:43.584 --> 37:45.626
[bleep]

37:45.626 --> 37:47.709
[bleep] me.

37:47.709 --> 37:53.542
Coming up...

37:53.542 --> 37:55.083
-[alarm beeping]
-Thirty-one knots.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.375
What happened?

37:56.375 --> 37:59.042
Let me get this
engine started.

37:59.042 --> 38:03.417
Are we gonna run aground?

38:03.417 --> 38:04.959
Seven knots...

38:04.959 --> 38:06.792
no whitecaps, nothing.

38:06.792 --> 38:09.125
Sh-- we're, like, going
the opposite direction.

38:09.125 --> 38:11.209
Hey, Bunny, you have
a lotta hot air.

38:11.209 --> 38:12.375
Make these sails go.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.709
[exhales]

38:13.709 --> 38:15.667
-Oh, my God.
-I don't know about that.

38:15.667 --> 38:19.083
Sorry there's no wind, but
I promise dinner'll be amazing.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.375
Okay, we're gonna
put these sails down.

38:20.375 --> 38:21.375
All right.

38:21.375 --> 38:22.542
You wanna steer while we do it?

38:22.542 --> 38:23.542
Sure.

38:23.542 --> 38:26.042
So, Gabriela, you're
doing dinner service,

38:26.042 --> 38:27.667
she's doing turn-downs.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.250
And the theme tonight is...

38:29.250 --> 38:30.876
Yeah, is the Spanish flamenco.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.334
Flamenco, so the fans,
the roses, the red...

38:33.334 --> 38:35.918
-Exactly.
-Yeah, okay.

38:35.918 --> 38:36.959
Looks good, Glenn.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.584
-Good?
-Yeah.

38:38.584 --> 38:41.125
Colin, you can let her go.
Let's go to one and a half.

38:41.125 --> 38:44.626
Copy, one and a half.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.167
Right now we probably have
about 18 feet underneath us.

38:47.167 --> 38:48.334
Okay.

38:48.334 --> 38:49.792
But we are 15 feet
under the water.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.083
Wow.

38:51.083 --> 38:54.000
That's one and a half, mate.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.042
That's something we
try not to do.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.167
[knocks on wood]

38:58.167 --> 38:59.542
Oh!

38:59.542 --> 39:01.751
[bleep] Yes, that's a rose.

39:01.751 --> 39:04.209
She did it, that's what
we're doing tonight.

39:04.209 --> 39:08.209
Oh, look at you, coming to
give me your dirty laundry.

39:08.209 --> 39:17.459
Yep, wet.
Everything's wet.

39:17.459 --> 39:19.876
All right, almost ready.

39:19.876 --> 39:21.000
Do you wanna go get changed?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.667
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

39:24.667 --> 39:30.626
-I think that's good.
-All right, cool.

39:30.626 --> 39:33.292
I'm really excited to
see what dinner's about.

39:33.292 --> 39:35.042
I'm excited that I'm up for it.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.375
We are ready.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.250
Would you care
for some Rioja, Tyler?

39:38.250 --> 39:39.876
-You know what, no.
-Okay.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.375
Yes, I'll have some.

39:41.375 --> 39:43.709
-Okay.
-Light pour, light pour.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.375
Heavy pour.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.918
Okay.
That's pretty hot.

39:47.918 --> 39:49.792
Thank you.

39:49.792 --> 39:51.501
Oh, the food, okay.

39:51.501 --> 39:53.209
I am so relaxed right now,
I can't even.

39:53.209 --> 39:54.959
What do you think that could be?

39:54.959 --> 39:57.584
I can hear them sizzling.

39:57.584 --> 39:59.876
Whoa.
You've outdone yourself!

39:59.876 --> 40:01.167
Here he is!

40:01.167 --> 40:02.959
Typical Spanish food tonight.

40:02.959 --> 40:05.959
Octopus a la Gallega,
calamaris en su tinta,

40:05.959 --> 40:09.667
shrimp al ajillo, and
some oysters with caviar.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.834
-Nice, amazing.
-Oh, my God.

40:11.834 --> 40:13.292
This is delicious.

40:13.292 --> 40:18.959
Just go like this.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.167
Hey.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.167
-Okay?
-Yeah, I'm done.

40:21.167 --> 40:23.167
Good job.

40:23.167 --> 40:25.375
Holy guacamole.

40:25.375 --> 40:28.459
That paella is prettier than me.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.000
Ready whenever you are.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.792
All right.

40:32.792 --> 40:33.417
Holy moly.
