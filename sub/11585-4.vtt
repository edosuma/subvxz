(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.071 --> 00:06.774
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.510
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.543 --> 00:11.379
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:11.412 --> 00:12.746
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.780 --> 00:14.782
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.218
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.253
BEAUTIFUL, HUH?

00:19.287 --> 00:20.821
EVERYTHING'S BEAUTIFUL
TO YOU TODAY.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.823
THE WAITRESS, THE HOSTESS.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.624
AH, DON'T START.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.459
YOUR EYEBALLS
GOT QUITE A WORKOUT.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.561
SO DID YOUR MOUTH,
GUZZLING ALL THOSE MIMOSAS.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.497
AND IN THE BUFFET LINE, YOU--

00:29.530 --> 00:31.165
NO. NO, NO.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.567
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

00:33.601 --> 00:34.702
NOT TODAY.

00:36.570 --> 00:40.074
JANICE...

00:40.108 --> 00:42.343
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:42.376 --> 00:46.214
I SAID WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:56.590 --> 00:58.192
WHO'S OUR FLOATER?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.328
FEMALE, 30s.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.431
I'D SAY SHE'S BEEN
IN THE WATER ABOUT 36 HOURS.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.334
BRUISING AROUND THE NECK
INDICATES MANUAL STRANGULATION.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.236
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH US.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.603
PELVIC REGION DOES.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.538
PANTIES TORN,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.673
GENITALS MUTILATED
FROM BITING OR CUTTING.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.542
HARD TO SAY
TILL I DRY HER OUT.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.144
AND THERE'S ANOTHER TWIST.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.279
HANDS AMPUTATED, MID-ULNA.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.880
THE KILLER DOESN'T
WANT US TO I.D. HER.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.382
HE'S ANGRY AND HE'S SMART.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.416
THAT'S A BAD COMBINATION.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.352
LOOK UP ON THE ROOF THERE.
I THINK WE GOT COMPANY.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.853
THINK IT'S OUR PERP
HANGING AROUND

01:25.886 --> 01:27.255
TO WATCH US
SCRATCH OUR HEADS?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.689
SOME CREEPS REALLY GET OFF
ON THE ATTENTION.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.857
LET'S GIVE HIM SOME.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.693
[woman screaming]

01:32.726 --> 01:34.828
BASTARD'S ATTACKING
SOMEONE ELSE!

01:36.530 --> 01:37.498
GET AWAY FROM THE GIRL!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.633
[screams]

01:39.667 --> 01:40.768
GET AWAY FROM THE GIRL!

01:40.801 --> 01:42.536
DOWN TO THE GROUND!
GET ON YOUR KNEES!

01:42.570 --> 01:43.637
ON YOUR KNEES!
ON YOUR KNEES!

01:43.671 --> 01:44.772
COME WITH ME.
COME WITH ME.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.340
GET DOWN!
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

01:46.374 --> 01:47.575
(man)
WHOA! WAIT,
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.609
POLICE!

01:48.642 --> 01:50.511
DON'T SHOOT ME.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.545
DROP IT!
DROP IT!

01:53.281 --> 01:55.249
RELAX!
WE'RE JUST MAKIN' A MOVIE.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.473
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
HE WASN'T ATTACKING ME.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.807
YOUR SCREAMS SURE FOOLED US.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.943
IT'S CALLED ACTING.
WE'RE ACTORS.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.945
ACTORS?
YEAH.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.813
ACTORS.
AND I'M THE DIRECTOR.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.914
AND I'M A JAMAICAN
JET PILOT.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.618
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN THESE
RAPE-AND-TAPE SCAMS BEFORE.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.919
YOU LURE THE ARAB GIRL
OFF THE STREET.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.456
MARTIN "SCORSLEAZY" HERE
FILMS THE ATTACK.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.258
SHOWS WHAT HE KNOWS.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.326
ROSIE ISN'T ARAB.
SHE'S DOMINICAN.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.761
PRETTY GOOD ACCENT, HUH?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.696
I TOTALLY
RESEARCHED THE PART.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.465
GOT THE CLOTHES
ON ATLANTIC AVENUE.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.666
YOU WANNA HEAR ME
ULULATE?

03:18.699 --> 03:19.733
NO.
[ululating]

03:19.767 --> 03:21.635
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANNA HEAR?

03:21.669 --> 03:26.240
HOW YOU CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT
MAKING ANTI-MUSLIM RAPE PORN.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.308
PORN?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.842
IT'S ART.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.311
SEX IS DANGEROUS.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.280
I MEAN, AT ITS CORE
ITS A POWER STRUGGLE

03:32.313 --> 03:33.947
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.316
NOT IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.784
[scoffs]

03:36.817 --> 03:38.719
PEOPLE LOOK TO PORN
FOR PROVOCATIVE IMAGERY.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.788
SO...WE PROVOKE.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.822
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.357
YOU--PLEASE TELL ME

03:43.391 --> 03:44.558
YOU'RE NOT AS BIG A CLOWN
AS YOUR FRIEND THERE.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.760
WELL, HEY,
EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR KINK.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.329
OUR AUDIENCE POPS WOOD
FOR A LITTLE FAUX RAPE.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.330
SO WHAT?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.531
FAUX RAPE, MM-HMM.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.899
EITHER ONE OF YOU GENIUSES
NOTICE A REAL RAPE AND MURDER

03:51.932 --> 03:53.601
GOING DOWN ON THE STREET?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.568
MURDER?

03:54.602 --> 03:55.869
WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.605
NOT A CAR, NOT A PERSON,
NOTHING?

03:57.638 --> 03:58.606
THERE WAS A CAB.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.574
IT WAS PARKED DOWN THERE
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.310
KIND OF WEIRD,
JUST HANGING OUT.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.512
JERK ALMOST RAN US OVER ON
SATURDAY WHEN WE WERE UNLOADING.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.679
GET A CAB NUMBER?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.715
MIGHT BE ON MY CAMERA.
IF IT STILL WORKS.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.622
IT'S TOO FAR TO SEE
THE CAB NUMBER FROM HERE.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.857
BUT...

04:16.890 --> 04:18.292
HE GETS A LOT CLOSER.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.693
COME ON.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.794
[tires screech]

04:20.828 --> 04:22.930
(Stabler)
FREEZE IT AND ZOOM IN.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.666
CAB 2X89.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.903
(Benson)
EDWARD DEPABLO.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.672
DROP THE SPONGE,
STEP AWAY FROM THE BUCKET.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.975
WHAT? WASHING A CAR
IS A CRIME NOW?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.176
DESTROYING EVIDENCE IS.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.912
[chuckles]
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
DESTROYING EVIDENCE?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.581
(Benson)
WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY NIGHT,
AROUND MIDNIGHT?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.483
SAME PLACE I WAS
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.017
FLAT ON MY BACK INSIDE.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.619
DAMN SUMMER FLU.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.621
EDDIE!
WHO YOU TALKIN' TO?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.856
AH, IT'S THE COPS,
HONEY.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.558
MRS. DEPABLO?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.093
CAN YOU VERIFY YOUR HUSBAND'S
WHEREABOUTS THIS WEEKEND?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.763
HE WAS ON HIS FAT ASS
ON MY COUCH,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.931
BITCHIN'
HOW HIS HEAD HURTS.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
WHERE WAS THE CAB
THIS WEEKEND?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.402
NOBODY DRIVES THIS RIG
'CEPT ME.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.803
I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.505
EVERY MINUTE
HE'S LYING AROUND

05:04.538 --> 05:06.774
IS ANOTHER MINUTE WE AIN'T
PAYIN' OUR PHONE--

05:06.807 --> 05:08.376
WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE

05:08.409 --> 05:09.810
IF YOU WASN'T ON THAT DAMN
INTERWEB ALL THE TIME.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.413
ELLIOT, CAB 2X89.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.415
IT'S THE SAME MAKE,
IT'S THE SAME MODEL.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.784
BUT THE CAB IN THE VIDEO
HAS NO DAMAGE.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.653
THIS ONE HAS A RUSTY FENDER.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.890
(Stabler)
WE'VE GOT TWO CABS
WITH THE SAME NUMBER.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.693
STRING OF RAPES IN BROOKLYN,
QUEENS, AND THE BRONX

05:25.726 --> 05:27.661
LAST 18 MONTHS BY A GUY
DRIVING WHAT APPEARS TO BE

05:27.695 --> 05:29.663
THE SAME CAB.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.631
NO VICTIM DESCRIPTIONS,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.601
NO FLUID OR FIBERS
LEFT BEHIND.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.668
SO HE BOUNCES FROM
BOROUGH TO BOROUGH

05:34.702 --> 05:35.803
BEFORE THE COPS
CATCH HIM.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.405
GUY KNOWS HOW
TO BE A GHOST.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.872
BATTERY PARK'S THE PERFECT
PLACE TO BUST HIS CHERRY

05:38.906 --> 05:40.040
IN MANHATTAN.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.409
IT'S A LONG WALK
TO THE NEAREST SUBWAY.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.043
THERE'S A LOT OF SHOPS
AND BARS NEARBY.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.546
IN OTHER WORDS,
LOTS OF TIPSY VICTIMS.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.681
YOU TWO CANVASS AROUND
WHERE THE CAB WAS PARKED.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.549
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND:

05:48.582 --> 05:50.518
CIGARETTE BUTT,
FOOD, TRASH--ANYTHING.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.985
LIV, ELLIOT,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.954
SEE IF THE LAST
LIVING VICTIM

05:53.987 --> 05:57.725
CAN GIVE US ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT HOW THIS SCUMBAG OPERATES.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.595
(woman)
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.564
THE BAR'S ONLY
FOUR BLOCKS FROM HERE,

06:03.597 --> 06:07.701
SO...AROUND MIDNIGHT I...

06:07.735 --> 06:08.702
SAID GOOD NIGHT
TO EVERYONE

06:08.736 --> 06:11.539
AND STARTED
WALKING HOME.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.607
THE POLICE REPORT SAID THAT
YOU WERE CARRYING SOME BAGS.

06:13.641 --> 06:16.510
JUST A FEW PRESENTS.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.679
BUT THEN IT STARTED RAINING.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.815
AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
THIS CAB SHOWS UP.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.617
I WAS CROSSING THE STREET,

06:23.651 --> 06:24.652
AND SUDDENLY
I WAS IN HIS HEADLIGHTS.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.153
COULDN'T SEE HIS FACE?

06:26.186 --> 06:27.855
I WAS BLINDED.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.857
SAID HE'D GIVE ME
A HALF FARE.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.895
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,
HE GRABBED MY BAGS

06:34.928 --> 06:36.697
AND I WAS IN HIS CAR.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.733
AND YOU CAN'T
DESCRIBE HIM AT ALL?

06:39.767 --> 06:41.669
HAIR COLOR,
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.504
NO.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.205
[crying]

06:45.238 --> 06:47.741
HE TOLD ME TO...
LIE DOWN IN THE BACK SEAT

06:47.775 --> 06:53.614
AND TURN OVER.

06:53.647 --> 06:57.785
THEN HE WAS IN THE BACK.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.952
ON TOP OF ME.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.892
IN ME.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.229
AND THE WHOLE TIME,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.064
HE HAD HIS...

07:11.098 --> 07:12.633
HAND AROUND MY NECK.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.968
SAYING IF I EVEN
LOOKED AT HIM,

07:15.002 --> 07:17.705
HE WOULD CHOKE THE LIFE
OUT OF ME.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.947
AND I WISH HE HAD.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.082
[cell phone ringing]

07:31.852 --> 07:33.220
IT'S THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.522
EXCUSE ME.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.223
DID THIS GUY KILL SOMEONE?

07:36.256 --> 07:39.793
WE BELIEVE
THAT HE'S ESCALATED.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.829
[crying]

07:43.697 --> 07:45.799
OH, MY GOD!

07:45.833 --> 07:48.536
LISTEN, YOU'RE HERE.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.738
AND YOU'RE ALIVE.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.511
GOOD NEWS.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.646
SOMEWHAT.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.180
WE'LL TAKE
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.815
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN RAPED,

08:01.849 --> 08:02.983
BUT THE GENITAL MUTILATION

08:03.016 --> 08:05.218
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
MARINE ORGANISMS

08:05.252 --> 08:06.720
FEEDING ON SOFT TISSUE.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.923
SEVERAL SPECIES, PROBABLY,
INCLUDING

08:09.957 --> 08:12.526
A JUVENILE ANGUILLA ROSTRADA.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.629
(Benson)
YOU SURE?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.631
IT WAS STILL ON THE JOB.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.733
ALSO...I DON'T THINK

08:19.767 --> 08:22.536
THE PERP AMPUTATED
HER HANDS.

08:22.570 --> 08:26.039
THESE BREAKS DON'T INDICATE
A STRAIGHT, FINE-EDGED BLADE.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.875
WHATEVER DID THAT
IS BLUNTER.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.309
AND MORE CURVED.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.079
AND DELIVERED A HELL OF A LOT
MORE FORCE THAN A HUMAN CAN.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.080
LIKE A BOAT PROPELLER.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.748
EXACTLY.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.651
MAYBE SHE FELL OFF
ONE OF THOSE BOOZE CRUISES

08:37.685 --> 08:38.886
THAT DEPART
FROM THE MARINA.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.754
(Benson)
OR SHE WAS DUMPED.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.322
THAT ALL YOU GOT?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.125
WOULD I HAVE DRAGGED YOU
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE IF IT WAS?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.895
THE CARBON-14 LEVELS
IN THE LENS OF HER EYE

08:47.928 --> 08:49.930
GAVE ME A PRECISE FIX
ON HER AGE.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.199
35 YEARS, FOUR MONTHS.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.234
SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.869
ONLY THAT SHE HAS THE BONES

08:55.903 --> 08:57.671
OF A 60-YEAR-OLD.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.239
THE FRACTURES
ALONG HER ULNA

08:59.272 --> 09:01.108
SHOW A LOT MORE SHATTER
THAN YOU'D EXPECT

09:01.141 --> 09:02.810
EVEN FROM A PROPELLER.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.611
STILL DOESN'T TELL US
WHO SHE IS.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.979
HER TEETH MAY BE
GETTING US CLOSER.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.916
I'M SEEING SEVERAL AREAS
OF UNCORRECTED

09:08.949 --> 09:11.151
MAXILLARY MALOCCLUSION.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.220
ANY AMERICAN DENTIST
WORTH HIS SALT

09:13.253 --> 09:15.055
WOULD HAVE LOBBIED
FOR BRACES.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.857
A LACK OF FLUORIDATED WATER
WOULD EXPLAIN

09:16.890 --> 09:18.859
THE NUMBER OF OLD CAVITIES.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.294
MY BET: SHE'S EUROPEAN.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.529
WELL, IF SHE ENTERED
THE COUNTRY LEGALLY,

09:22.562 --> 09:24.932
STATE SHOULD HAVE HER THUMBPRINT
AND HER RETINAL SCAN ON FILE.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.733
THINK WE MISSED THE BOAT
WITH THE THUMB.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.835
SHE STILL HAS
ONE GOOD EYEBALL.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.770
CALL US WHEN
YOU GOT A NAME.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.205
HEY, YOU FIND ANYTHING
WHERE THE CAB WAS PARKED?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.907
JUST THE USUAL
HUMAN DETRITUS

09:33.941 --> 09:35.943
SEARCHING FOR MEANING
IN A MEANINGLESS UNIVERSE.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.379
OH, YEAH, FIN FOUND WHAT MIGHT
BE OUR BAD GUY'S WHIZ.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.380
CABBIE'S GOTTA GO
SOMETIME.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.782
THERE'S NO DNA
IN URINE.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.350
THERE IS IF SKIN CELLS
ARE FLOATING IN IT.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.985
YOU EVER TRY TO TAKE A LEAK
IN ONE OF THESE THINGS?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.086
GOTTA WORK HARD.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.889
IT'S A TIGHT FIT.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.625
WARNER GOT A HIT
OFF THE URINE SAMPLE.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.893
CREDIT WHERE
CREDIT IS DUE.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.228
IT WAS FIN AND HIS EXHAUSTIVE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN PENIS.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.765
I WANT YOU TO MEET
ORLANDO MCTEER.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.033
FORMER DRIVER
FOR MIDTOWN CAB.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.835
DID TIME UPSTATE
FOR AGGRAVATED RAPE.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.937
PAROLED A YEAR
AND A HALF AGO.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.338
THAT'S THE SAME TIME
THE CABBIE RAPIST

10:05.372 --> 10:06.774
BEGAN STRIKING.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.341
SO WE GOT THE CREEP'S
DNA FROM HIS PEE,

10:08.375 --> 10:11.111
BUT WE DON'T HAVE DNA
FROM ANY VICTIM TO MATCH IT TO.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.213
SO, IN LEGAL PARLANCE,
WE GOT SQUAT.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.748
WELL, WE KNOW WHERE
HE HANGS OUT.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.650
WE KNOW THAT HE PREFERS
BLONDES CARRYING PACKAGES.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.951
LET'S SAY WE CATCH HIM
IN THE ACT,

10:17.985 --> 10:19.920
TURN THE CASE FROM
CIRCUMSTANTIAL TO SOLID.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.955
LET'S GO DANGLE SOME BAIT.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.370
NEED A CAB, MISS?

10:37.404 --> 10:40.107
NO, THANK YOU.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.009
OH, A PRETTY LADY LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WALK.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.043
TELL YOU WHAT--HALF FARE.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.012
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THOSE BAGS.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.281
[handcuffs snap]

10:48.315 --> 10:50.150
WHAT THE HELL?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.351
JUST NEVER KNOW WHO
YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP,

10:51.384 --> 10:52.652
HUH, MCTEER?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.357
(man)
YOU EVEN LOOK AT ME,

10:57.390 --> 10:59.893
I'LL CHOKE THE LIFE OF YOU.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.895
(second man)
YOU EVEN LOOK AT ME,
I'LL CHOKE THE LIFE OUT OF YOU.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.463
THAT'S HIM!

11:03.496 --> 11:07.067
YOU SURE?
THERE ARE THERE MORE IN THERE.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.870
HE'S THE ONE WHO RAPED ME.
I KNOW HIS VOICE.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.740
I'LL ALWAYS KNOW IT.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.042
I'M TELLING YOU,
I DIDN'T RAPE ANYONE.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.010
HMM, WHO DO WE BELIEVE--

11:17.044 --> 11:18.478
THE WOMAN
WHO JUST ID'D HIM--

11:18.511 --> 11:20.981
OR A CONVICTED RAPIST
DRIVING AN ILLEGAL CAB?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.750
YEAH, OKAY,
I FAKED A MEDALLION,

11:22.783 --> 11:24.885
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
NO REAL COMPANY WOULD HIRE ME.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.386
BUT, LADY, I DIDN'T MEAN YOU
NO HARM, I SWEAR.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.955
WELL, YOU CAN SWEAR
ALL YOU WANT.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.257
THE JURY'S GONNA CONVICT YOU
BASED ON YOUR RECORD.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.892
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
BE A NICKEL LIKE BEFORE.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.394
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT 25 TO LIFE, SO...

11:34.427 --> 11:35.996
BYE-BYE, PAL.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.901
OKAY!

11:40.934 --> 11:42.002
OKAY....

11:45.372 --> 11:46.740
I RAPED THAT GIRL.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.842
THE OTHER ONES TOO.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.244
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.815
PROVE IT.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.149
YOU SAID THAT GIRL
DIED ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

11:56.183 --> 11:57.484
I WASN'T IN THE CITY
FRIDAY NIGHT.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.753
I WASN'T EVEN
IN THE STATE.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.254
I WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA
VISITING MY OLD MAN.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.523
LIKE THE FATHER'S NOT GONNA
ALIBI HIS SON.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.093
HE WENT TO BED EARLY,

12:06.126 --> 12:07.928
AND I WENT OUT.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.163
IN MY CAB.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.872
I PICKED A GIRL UP
OUTSIDE THE MALL.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.509
I HELPED HER WITH HER BAGS,
AND THEN...

12:22.542 --> 12:24.411
I DID THINGS TO HER.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.181
SAID THAT IF
SHE TOLD ANYONE,

12:28.215 --> 12:31.118
I WOULD COME TO HER HOME
AND GET HER.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.254
I TOOK HER LICENSE.
I STILL HAVE IT.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.755
GO FIND HER.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.760
SHE'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I DID TO HER.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.530
BUSHKILL P.D.
FOUND THE VICTIM.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.332
SHE CONFIRMS IT ALL.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.934
THE MALL PICKUP,
THE THREAT.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.035
EVEN SAYS SHE SCRATCHED HIM.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.469
SO HE'S A RAPIST,
BUT NOT A KILLER.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.905
GREAT, SO BROOKLYN,
QUEENS, THE BRONX,

12:51.939 --> 12:55.342
AND, UH, PENNSYLVANIA
ALL CLEAR THEIR CASES.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.476
YEAH, WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.544
NOT EXACTLY.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.212
THAT RETINAL SCAN
PANNED OUT.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.149
OUR DEAD WOMAN'S NAME
IS MARGA JANTZEN.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.852
AND THE REASON SHE HAD
SUCH LOW BONE DENSITY--

13:04.885 --> 13:07.454
PROLONGED EXPOSURE
TO MICROGRAVITY.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.989
WHERE'D SHE GET
EXPOSED TO THAT?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.223
IN OUTER SPACE.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.325
MS. JANTZEN
WAS AN ASTRONAUT.

13:18.598 --> 13:23.070
AND OUR EXPERIMENTS IN LONG-TERM
SPACE EXPOSURE UP HERE

13:23.103 --> 13:26.974
WILL HELP US TO LIVE MORE SAFELY
WHEN WE GO BACK TO THE MOON.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
MARGA JANTZEN,
NATIVE OF BELGIUM.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.211
LUNAR SCIENTISTS FOR
THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.981
MARGA GAVE WEEKLY
SCIENCE LESSONS

13:34.014 --> 13:35.348
TO SCHOOL KIDS
AROUND THE GLOBE.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.517
THIS IS LAST JUNE
ABOARD THE I.S.S.,

13:37.550 --> 13:39.152
WHERE SHE LIVED
FOR 207 DAYS

13:39.186 --> 13:41.188
BEFORE RETURNING
ON THE ATLANTA SHUTTLE.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.123
FROM OUTER SPACE
TO OUR MORGUE.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.958
THAT'S ABOUT AS HARD
A LANDING AS YOU CAN GET.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.359
THOSE KIDS ARE GONNA
BE DEVASTATED.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.361
(Hagen)
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.064
BELGIAN CONSULATE IS ASKING
FOR THE RELEASE OF HER BODY

13:51.098 --> 13:52.866
SO IT CAN LIE IN STATE
IN BRUSSELS.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.002
THEY MAKING ANY NOISE ABOUT US
DOING THE INVESTIGATION?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.905
I REMINDED THEM
NYPD HAS JURISDICTION.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.006
BUT IF WE DON'T
CLOSE THIS FAST,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.942
THEY CAN MAKE A FORMAL REQUEST
TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.077
THE WOMAN SPENT SIX MONTHS
LOCKED IN A TIN CAN

14:04.111 --> 14:05.278
IN OUTER SPACE,

14:05.312 --> 14:06.646
AND THEN SHE DOESN'T
GO HOME TO BELGIUM.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.915
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

14:07.948 --> 14:08.949
SHE WAS GIVING A SPEECH

14:08.982 --> 14:10.450
AT A WEEK-LONG
SPACE SYMPOSIUM

14:10.483 --> 14:12.986
AT THE NEW YORK
HALL OF SCIENCE.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.925
(Stabler)
BACK TO THE MOON.
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.093
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AMBIVALENT
ABOUT THE SPACE PROGRAM.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.495
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT,
AND WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF IT?

14:22.529 --> 14:25.032
TANG?
SATELLITE NETWORK.
HEART PUMP TECHNOLOGY.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.200
BESIDES, EVERY KID
NEEDS A REAL HERO.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.602
I KNOW I ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.604
HI, EXCUSE ME--
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

14:31.638 --> 14:34.074
THE ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR
FOR SPACE FLIGHT.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.475
WE UNDERSTAND HE'S
AT THE CONFERENCE TODAY.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.010
ADMINISTRATOR HARKIN'S
ON THE DAIS AT THE MOMENT.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.111
IT'S IMPORTANT.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.983
WELL, IF THAT ISN'T
THE SORRIEST DAMN EXCUSE

14:43.016 --> 14:45.452
FOR A MARINE I EVER SAW.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.388
LIKE I CAME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

14:48.421 --> 14:49.656
TO HAVE SOME DEVIL DOG
PISS ON MY LEG.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.424
COLONEL, HOW ARE YOU?
ELLIOT STABLER.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.426
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU?
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.028
HUH?
TOO DAMN LONG, HUH?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.563
WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH ABOUT US.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.431
WHO IS THIS GORGEOUS WOMAN?

14:58.465 --> 15:00.333
THIS IS DETECTIVE
OLIVIA BENSON.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.936
COLONEL RICHARD FINLEY,
MARINE CORPS TEST PILOT.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.238
LEGENDARY ASTRONAUT
FOR APOLLO,

15:05.272 --> 15:06.940
SKYLAB, HALF A DOZEN
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.077
JEEZ, KID, DON'T
LAY IT ON SO THICK, HUH?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.444
IT IS A PLEASURE,
OLIVIA.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.980
THE PLEASURE IS MINE.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.147
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN MY PARTNER
FOR, WHAT TEN YEARS,

15:14.181 --> 15:16.083
AND YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME
THAT YOU KNOW AN ASTRONAUT.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.951
OH, LIKE I NEED
THE COMPETITION.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.054
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE TO ME.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.455
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO
OUT HERE?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.091
UH, BAD NEWS.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.392
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS
ON THE I.S.S.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.460
WAS FOUND DEAD YESTERDAY,
MARGARET JANTZEN.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.462
OH, NO.
HOW DID SHE--

15:29.496 --> 15:32.265
SHE WAS MURDERED.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.600
GOOD LORD.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.003
ADMINISTRATOR HARKIN
IS COMING OVER NOW

15:36.036 --> 15:37.204
TO TALK TO US.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.505
YEAH, ED'S A GOOD MAN.
HE'LL HELP YOU OUT.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.140
THE WHOLE AGENCY WILL.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.176
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, I'D BE GLAD
TO RUN POINT FOR YOU.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.544
GREASE SOME WHEELS.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.213
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO,
WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.048
LIKE IF YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY
WHO'D WANT TO HARM MS. JANTZEN.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.416
NOT A SOUL.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.251
MARGARET
WAS A HELL OF A GAL.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.154
ALTHOUGH I DID HEAR
ABOUT AN ARGUMENT

15:54.187 --> 15:56.089
BETWEEN HER AND ANDY
IN THE HOTEL BAR

15:56.123 --> 15:57.124
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.125
ANDY'S MARGARET'S HUSBAND?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.560
WELL, GIRLFRIEND, ACTUALLY.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.062
SHE'S A SEGMENT PRODUCER

16:02.095 --> 16:04.531
AT THE NBC AFFILIATE
IN HOUSTON.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.634
[gasps]

16:07.667 --> 16:09.069
IT'S HER.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.337
WAIT!

16:10.370 --> 16:11.771
WHERE'S HER NECKLACE?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.040
SHE HAD ONE
JUST LIKE MINE.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.408
UM...

16:15.442 --> 16:17.410
WE ONLY RECOVERED EARRINGS.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.712
NO, I HAD
MATCHING NECKLACES MADE

16:19.746 --> 16:22.082
WHILE SHE WAS IN SPACE.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.285
I GAVE MARGA HERS
THE MOMENT SHE LANDED.

16:25.318 --> 16:30.123
SHE SAID SHE'D
NEVER TAKE IT OFF.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.392
WE HEARD YOU TWO
ARGUED AT THE HOTEL.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.228
NO, NOT REALLY.
I--I ARGUED.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.463
SHE JUST APOLOGIZED.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.731
(Benson)
FOR WHAT?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.700
LAST APRIL, BEFORE LAUNCH,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.702
MARGA SAID WE'D
GO ON VACATION TOGETHER

16:42.735 --> 16:44.271
WHEN SHE GOT BACK.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.139
I--GOT A RENTAL CAR

16:46.173 --> 16:48.741
AND BOOKED A LODGE UPSTATE.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.344
WE WERE GONNA LEAVE
FIRST THING SATURDAY.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.613
FRIDAY NIGHT,
SHE CHANGED HER MIND?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.815
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO BE ALONE.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.186
I TRIED TO CONVINCE HER.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.454
SHE JUST LEFT ME
THERE IN THE LOBBY.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.124
SAID SHE WAS GOING OUTSIDE
FOR A WALK.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.159
AT MIDNIGHT?

17:06.193 --> 17:08.328
[crying]

17:08.361 --> 17:10.263
THAT WAS MARGA.

17:10.297 --> 17:14.101
NIGHTTIME WALKS ALWAYS
HELPED HER TO CLEAR HER HEAD.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.136
BUT WHY WOULD
SHE SUDDENLY BAIL?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.737
[sighs]

17:17.770 --> 17:20.540
MARGA WAS FREAKED OUT
ABOUT SOME KIND OF...

17:20.573 --> 17:22.209
INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED
ON ORBIT

17:22.242 --> 17:24.311
WITH ANOTHER ASTRONAUT.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.180
SHE RAN INTO THE GUY
AT THE SYMPOSIUM.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.283
(Stabler)
COLONEL.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.252
COLONEL.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.521
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT A NECKLACE
THAT MARGA JANTZEN WORE?

17:34.554 --> 17:38.191
NECKLACE? NO.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.493
BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT
ON THE SPACE STATION?

17:40.527 --> 17:41.828
THAT YOU FORGOT
TO TELL US ABOUT.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.134
EXCUSE ME.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.835
THE AGENCY DOESN'T
NEED ANOTHER

17:48.868 --> 17:51.171
ASTRONAUT-IN-A-DIAPER STORY.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.440
YEAH, THERE WAS A SCARE
ON ORBIT LAST MONTH

17:53.473 --> 17:55.242
WITH A FELLOW NAMED
LANCE CORLISS,

17:55.275 --> 17:56.309
A PAYLOAD SPECIALIST.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.577
THIS IS HIM.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.545
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.514
WELL, CORLISS WAS ON HIS ASS
FROM THE GET-GO.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.715
SPACE SICKNESS.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.850
HE GOT DEHYDRATED,

18:03.883 --> 18:05.485
STARTED BEHAVING
ERRATICALLY.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.320
WELL, THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING
200 MILES ABOVE EARTH

18:07.354 --> 18:08.388
IN A SMALL TUBE.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.157
YEAH, AND THE DOCS
IN HOUSTON

18:10.190 --> 18:12.225
OKAYED MARGA
TO GIVE HIM A SEDATIVE.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.860
BUT THEN THERE WAS
A FAILURE

18:13.893 --> 18:15.495
IN ONE OF THE SOLAR ARRAYS,

18:15.528 --> 18:17.530
AND THEY LOST POWER
IN SEVERAL MODULES.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.865
SO CORLISS FLIPPED OUT.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.133
HE HAD A TOTAL BREAKDOWN.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.634
DELUSIONS, PARANOIA.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.437
ACCUSING MARGA
OF TRYING TO KILL HIM.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.239
WELL, CORLISS
WILL NEVER FLY AGAIN.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.575
HE'S BEEN BANNED
FROM THE POST-FLIGHT JUNKET

18:28.608 --> 18:30.877
AND THE SYMPOSIUM THING,
ALL OF IT.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.445
WE THINK
THAT HE CAME ANYWAY

18:32.479 --> 18:33.680
AND FOUND MARGA
HERE FRIDAY.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.847
OH, JEEZ.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.484
COLONEL, WE NEED
TO FIND CORLISS--NOW.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.322
(man)
DICK, I DIDN'T KILL MARGA.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.358
SO WHY ARE THEY
ACCUSING ME?

18:45.392 --> 18:48.361
JUST ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS,
CORLISS.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.764
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.401
YOU CAME BACK TO NEW YORK
AFTER YOU WERE ORDERED NOT TO.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.337
YOU TRACKED MARGA DOWN
AT THE SYMPOSIUM.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.272
I HAD THE CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME...

18:59.306 --> 19:00.407
TO FLY IN SPACE.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.209
AND I BLEW IT.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.810
I RUINED EVERYTHING.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.912
THAT'S WHY
I CAME BACK HERE...

19:05.945 --> 19:07.414
TO TELL HER
I WAS SORRY.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.915
WELL, YOU FREAKED HER OUT.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.250
I KNOW.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.186
BUT SHE KEPT COOL,
JUST LIKE ON ORBIT.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.488
NO WONDER NASA WAS TRYING
TO POACH HER FROM THE ESA,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.457
GET HER TO HOUSTON
FULL TIME.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.692
SO YOU WEREN'T AT THE HOTEL
FRIDAY NIGHT AROUND MIDNIGHT?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.328
I WAS RIGHT HERE.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.329
FROM 9:00 ON.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.298
EVERY DAY SINCE.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.401
I GOT NOTHING TO GO BACK
TO HOUSTON FOR.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.403
YOU THINK I WANT
MY WIFE AND KIDS

19:30.437 --> 19:33.673
TO HAVE A SCREW-UP
LIKE ME AROUND?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.774
ASK EDDIE.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.577
HE'LL TELL YOU
I WAS HERE.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.479
YEAH, HE WAS HERE.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.619
ANOTHER SUSPECT
BITES THE DUST.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.755
I GOTTA SAY, I'M GLAD
IT WASN'T ONE OF MINE.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.756
SO WHAT NOW?

19:49.789 --> 19:50.923
WELL, I WAS THINKING

19:50.957 --> 19:52.392
YOU SHOULD READ
SOME OF THE MAIL WE GET.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.327
YOU KNOW,
MOSTLY FAN LETTERS.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.797
SOME OF IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
LIKE THREATS AND STUFF.

19:57.830 --> 19:58.931
WHERE'S THE MAIL?

19:58.965 --> 19:59.932
IT'S IN HOUSTON.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.669
BUT I CAN HAVE IT
ON A T-38 AT ELLINGTON FIELD

20:02.702 --> 20:05.272
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
AND BE HERE TOMORROW.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.006
SO, IN THE MEANTIME...

20:07.039 --> 20:08.408
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
ABOUT YOU TWO,

20:08.441 --> 20:10.343
BUT, UH,
I'M WITH CORLISS.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.280
I COULD USE A DRINK.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.448
SO I'M AT THE MOUSETRAP
IN COCO BEACH,

20:15.482 --> 20:17.016
HAVIN' A BEER
WITH PETE CONRAD,

20:17.049 --> 20:19.452
WHEN ONE OF THE LITTLE
BAR GALS COMES UP TO US

20:19.486 --> 20:22.021
AND IS CRYIN',
AND SHE SAYS NIXON

20:22.054 --> 20:24.324
JUST CANCELED THE LAST THREE
APOLLO FLIGHTS.

20:24.357 --> 20:28.328
WHICH MEANS I JUST
LOST MY RIDE TO THE MOON.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.962
SO WHAT'D YOU DO?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.931
WELL, I...ORDERED
ANOTHER BEER.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.366
[chuckles]

20:33.400 --> 20:35.735
BUT YOU STILL GOT
TO FLY IN SPACE.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.638
OLIVIA, YOU'RE TALKING TO
THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE PROGRAM.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.040
YOU KNOW,
I FLEW SKYLAB, A.L.T.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.809
I'M TIED FOR THE MOST
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.278
BUT, YOU KNOW, STILL...

20:45.312 --> 20:46.646
EVERY TIME I LOOK UP
AT THE NIGHT SKY,

20:46.679 --> 20:49.549
I THINK...WHAT I REALLY
WANTED TO DO BACK THEN

20:49.582 --> 20:51.318
WAS GO TO THE MOON.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.320
COLONEL FINLEY IS HEADING UP
NASA'S LUNAR RETURN

20:53.353 --> 20:54.454
IN 2018.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.323
AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE YOUNGEST GUY

20:56.356 --> 20:57.657
BACK IN '74--
NOW I'M THE OLDEST.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.459
BUT, YOU KNOW,

20:59.492 --> 21:01.294
AS LONG AS I GET THERE,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.262
SO HOW'D YOU TWO MEET,
ANYWAY?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.366
COLONEL, UH, DICK,

21:06.399 --> 21:09.336
WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL
I DID OUT IN BAYSIDE.

21:09.369 --> 21:13.406
I REMEMBER...
THIS HUGE PICTURE OF HIM--

21:13.440 --> 21:16.776
IT'S STILL THERE--
IN THE SCHOOL TROPHY CASE.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.511
HE'S GOT A SILVER
FLIGHT SUIT ON,

21:18.545 --> 21:19.746
AND IT'S WHEN YOU FLEW
THE X-15.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.348
IT'S ALL ANCIENT HISTORY.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.582
SO MY SENIOR YEAR,
DICK'S COMING BY

21:22.615 --> 21:24.016
TO GIVE A SPEECH
TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.752
AND THE STUDENT CLASS
PRESIDENT'S GONNA GO OUT

21:25.785 --> 21:27.987
AND PICK HIM UP
AT THE AIRPORT.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.622
[chuckles]

21:29.656 --> 21:31.491
AND I PAID HIM OFF
TO GET SICK THAT DAY,

21:31.524 --> 21:34.327
AND I WENT OUT INSTEAD
AND PICKED HIM UP.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.928
SO, DICK, YOU GOT EL
INTO THE MARINES.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.498
NOT THE TATTOO, THOUGH.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.533
BACK THEN,
THIS WAS A CRAZY KID.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.469
LIV, YOU GOT A SECOND?

21:42.502 --> 21:43.636
UH, YEAH.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.771
EXCUSE ME.

21:48.107 --> 21:48.941
WHAT'S UP?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.610
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
HITTING ATMs IN MIDTOWN.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.380
SO...
HMM?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.881
DICK, I'M MARRIED.

21:54.914 --> 21:55.948
NEVER STOPPED ME.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.584
YOU GOT THE FOUR DIVORCES
TO PROVE IT.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.352
[laughs]

21:59.386 --> 22:01.354
EL, SOMEBODY'S
HITTING ATMs

22:01.388 --> 22:02.489
IN MIDTOWN USING
MARGA'S CREDIT CARD.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.824
JUST SHOWED UP AT A GAS STATION
THREE BLOCKS FROM HERE.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.526
YOU MIND IF AN OLD MARINE
TAGS ALONG?

22:06.559 --> 22:08.861
UH...YOUR CALL.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.465
YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TOO MANY.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.637
LOOK, THE STUPID PUMP
WON'T TAKE IT,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.439
SO JUST RUN IT
ON THE REGISTER

22:19.472 --> 22:20.707
AND GIVE ME THE CASH BACK.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.376
I TOLD YOU,
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A MUGGER

22:23.410 --> 22:24.511
AND YOU DON'T HAVE I.D.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.445
DAMN IT!

22:25.478 --> 22:28.948
PUT TWO BUCKS ON PUMP THREE
AND GO TO HELL.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.550
HEY, POLICE.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.486
PUT THAT DOWN.
GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.487
WHAT'D I DO?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.022
SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR HANDS
AGAINST THE POST.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.990
[coughs]

22:38.024 --> 22:39.492
STAY RIGHT THERE.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.093
MATCHES.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.595
AND METH.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.130
SURPRISE OF ALL SURPRISES.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.632
KID'S A WALKIN' PHARMACY.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.534
HEY, NONE OF THAT
BELONGS TO ME.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.635
I'M SURE IT DOESN'T.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.808
ELLIOT!

22:57.143 --> 22:58.611
ELLIOT!

23:00.547 --> 23:01.548
UHH!

23:05.518 --> 23:08.588
ONCE A MARINE,
ALWAYS A MARINE.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.801
HELLOOO.

23:21.834 --> 23:22.602
[sniffles]

23:22.635 --> 23:26.839
SOMEONE GONNA COME
AND TALK TO ME?

23:26.873 --> 23:30.042
I CAN HEAR YOU WATCHING ME!

23:30.076 --> 23:34.547
YOOHOO!
COME IN, CALCUTTA!

23:34.581 --> 23:36.683
WHERE'D THIS GUY
BEAM DOWN FROM?

23:36.716 --> 23:37.850
PLANET METHAMPHETAMINE,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.486
ALONG WITH
MARGA'S CREDIT CARD.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.987
WE SURE HE UNDERSTOOD
MIRANDA?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.221
HE SEEMED TO.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.591
I WANT ANYTHING
WE GET FROM HIM

23:44.624 --> 23:46.058
ABOUT HER MURDER
TO STICK.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.694
WELL, IT'D ALSO BE NICE
TO KNOW WHO HE IS

23:47.727 --> 23:48.861
SINCE HE WON'T
GIVE US HIS NAME.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.530
HIS PRINTS
SPEAK LOUD AND CLEAR.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.531
VINCENT BECKWITH.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.065
12 ARRESTS
OVER THREE YEARS.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.803
POSSESSION, BURGLARY,
SELLING STOLEN GOODS.

23:56.836 --> 23:57.937
ALL A FAR CRY
FROM MURDER.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.105
WELL, HOW ABOUT
A RESTRAINING ORDER,

23:59.138 --> 24:00.873
A CONVICTION
FOR SECOND-DEGREE MENACING,

24:00.907 --> 24:02.108
TWO SEPARATE VICTIMS.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.711
OKAY, SO IT SOUNDS LIKE VINCE
HAS A PROBLEM FIXATING ON WOMEN.

24:04.744 --> 24:05.712
AND IF HE'S
LOCKED ONTO MARGA,

24:05.745 --> 24:07.013
MAYBE WE CAN FIND
SOME LOVE LETTERS FROM HIM

24:07.046 --> 24:08.515
IN DICK'S BATCH OF MAIL.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.882
(Cragen)
MUNCH, GO THROUGH IT.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.017
HUANG'S ALREADY ON HIS WAY
HERE TO HELP.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.852
COLONEL, IF YOU COULD
LEND A HAND,

24:12.885 --> 24:14.253
SEE IF YOU
RECOGNIZE ANYBODY.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.888
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.990
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A RUN AT ROCKET MAN.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.994
VINCE, YOU READY
TO JOIN US HERE ON EARTH

24:22.028 --> 24:23.029
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.931
WELL, HOW 'BOUT YOU
ANSWER FOR THIS!

24:24.964 --> 24:26.866
ONE OF YOU PIGS SLUGGED ME,
AND I WANT HIS NAME

24:26.899 --> 24:27.900
AND BADGE NUMBER.

24:27.934 --> 24:28.935
WHO SAYS IT WAS A HE?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.937
ACTUALLY, VINCE,
IT WASN'T A COP.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.038
AND HE DOESN'T
HAVE A BADGE,

24:32.071 --> 24:34.507
SO, IN A WAY,
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.243
SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS?

24:37.276 --> 24:40.547
NOW TELL US ABOUT THE WOMAN
YOU STOLE THE CREDIT CARD FROM.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.516
WOMAN?
I DON'T KNOW ANY WOMAN.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.885
EROTOMANIA IS DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER STALKING DISORDERS.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.887
INSTEAD OF FIXATING
ON AN EX-LOVER

24:47.920 --> 24:49.021
OR A WORK ACQUAINTANCE,

24:49.055 --> 24:51.624
THE EROTOMANIAC
BECOMES CONVINCED

24:51.658 --> 24:53.626
THAT HE'S LOVED
BY A CELEBRITY.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.127
IT'S RARELY SEXUAL.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.696
IT'S MORE OF AN OBSESSION

24:56.729 --> 24:58.197
WITH AN IMAGINARY
SHARED DESTINY.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.732
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR

24:59.766 --> 25:01.267
BESIDES THE NAME
VINCE BECKWITH?

25:01.300 --> 25:02.802
UH, THREAT LANGUAGE.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.036
ANYTHING WITH
A SPECIFIC DATE,

25:04.070 --> 25:05.672
OR OWNING A WEAPON.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.039
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
SURPRISED YOU JET JOCKEYS

25:07.073 --> 25:08.608
GET ALL THIS.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.043
THE MOON HAS LONG BEEN
THOUGHT TO INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.312
THE WORD LUNACY COMES
FROM THE LATIN LUNATICUS.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.681
LITERALLY: MOON SICK.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.082
WELL, ME,
I'LL TAKE THE OBVIOUS NUT

25:16.115 --> 25:17.850
OVER THE JOKER WHO THINKS
WE NEVER WENT THERE.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.019
WELL, THERE'S
A LOT OF PEOPLE

25:20.052 --> 25:21.921
WHO THINK THOSE JOKERS
ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.290
YEAH, WELL, BUZZ ALDRIN
HAD THE RIGHT IDEA, YOU KNOW.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.325
WHEN SOME JOKER TRIED
TO LAY THAT CRAP ON HIM,

25:26.358 --> 25:29.261
BUZZ JUST PUNCHED HIM
RIGHT IN THE NOSE.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.867
HERE'S ONE.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.703
TO MARGA.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.037
MARGA WHO?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.005
JANTZEN.
SHE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.039
MY CABLE'S OUT.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.074
MAYBE YOU REMEMBER
STRANGLING HER FRIDAY NIGHT

25:42.108 --> 25:43.009
OUTSIDE THE ARGUS HOTEL.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.177
WELL, I AIN'T BEEN
ANYWHERE NEAR THE ARGUS.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.579
SO YOU DIDN'T
STEAL HER CREDIT CARD

25:46.613 --> 25:48.047
AND TOSS HER PURSE
INTO A DUMPSTER?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.281
PURSE?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.918
I FOUND THAT CARD
ON THE STREET IN MIDTOWN!

25:51.951 --> 25:53.920
FINDERS KEEPERS,
RIGHT?

25:53.953 --> 25:56.355
THAT'S ENOUGH, VINCENT.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.757
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.891
WHO SENT YOU, MS. WALSH?

25:58.925 --> 26:00.026
MY FRIGGIN' DAD.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.128
I'M COUNSEL
FOR BECKWITH AND SONS.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.964
VINCENT'S FATHER RECOGNIZED HIM
ON LAST NIGHT'S NEWS,

26:04.997 --> 26:07.066
AND HE HOPES THAT WE CAN
CLEAR THIS UP

26:07.099 --> 26:08.901
AND FORESTALL
ANY FURTHER PUBLICITY.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.102
BECKWITH AND SONS,
THE AUCTION HOUSE?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.204
I'M THE FAMILY
EMBARRASSMENT.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.906
WHO'S BEING HELD
ON SUSPICION OF MURDER.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.742
FOR WHICH YOU HAVE
PRECISELY ZERO EVIDENCE,

26:15.775 --> 26:16.943
AND FROM WHAT I OVERHEARD,

26:16.976 --> 26:18.177
YOU CAN'T EVEN LINK HIM
TO THE VICTIM.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.947
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING
TO LINK HIM TO REALITY FIRST.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.949
GO SCREW YOURSELF!
VINCENT, BE QUIET.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.216
YOU TOO, BITCH!

26:24.250 --> 26:25.818
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
OR MY DAD'S, ALL RIGHT?

26:25.852 --> 26:26.819
TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD, FIN.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.856
HOW 'BOUT I FOUND MARGA'S
MISSING NECKLACE.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.792
PRETTY DECENT PRINT
ON IT TOO.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.794
ANYONE THERE
RECALL WHO PAWNED IT?

26:34.827 --> 26:36.162
YEAH, THE OWNER SAYS HE DOES.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.329
CAN YOU SEND ME A PIC?

26:37.363 --> 26:38.330
OH, YEAH.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.331
THE ONLY PERSON

26:39.365 --> 26:40.933
MY OLD MAN CARES ABOUT
IS HIMSELF!

26:40.967 --> 26:43.736
SO PULL YOUR HEAD
OUT OF HIS ASS, LADY!

26:43.770 --> 26:44.737
HEY, VINCE.
WHAT?!

26:44.771 --> 26:46.005
SAY CHEESE.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.206
VINCE...

26:47.239 --> 26:49.108
WILL YOU SHUT UP?

26:54.080 --> 26:56.148
LIV, HE SAYS IT'S HIM.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.283
THANKS, FIN.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.052
GET IT TO CSU
TO VERIFY THE PRINT.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.658
WELL, WELL, VINCE.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.727
SO YOU'RE STILL SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW OUR VICTIM?

27:07.760 --> 27:10.062
BECAUSE WE FOUND
THE NECKLACE

27:10.096 --> 27:13.299
THAT YOU SNATCHED OFF HER NECK
WITH YOUR FINGERPRINT ON IT.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.068
[clears throat]

27:16.102 --> 27:18.938
MY CLIENT
WILL FULLY COOPERATE

27:18.971 --> 27:21.140
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION
IN EXCHANGE

27:21.173 --> 27:22.775
FOR CERTAIN CONCESSIONS.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.010
SO YOU ADMIT
TO PAWNING THE NECKLACE?

27:24.043 --> 27:26.713
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
STEAL IT.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.182
I FOUND IT WITH THE PURSE
THAT WAS IN THAT DUMPSTER.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.151
AND I SURE AS HELL
AIN'T A KILLER.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.220
YOU'RE A STALKER.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.989
AN UNFORTUNATE
MISUNDERSTANDING

27:37.023 --> 27:39.158
WITH A GIRLFRIEND
AND A FORMER COUNSELOR.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.327
VINCENT'S ACTIONS
WEREN'T PRUDENT.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.063
BUT HE HARBORS NO ANIMOSITY
TOWARD WOMEN.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.097
I CAN HELP.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.866
YOU CAN HELP?
HOW?

27:46.899 --> 27:49.135
JUST BEFORE I DOVE
THE DUMPSTER,

27:49.168 --> 27:52.271
SOMEONE RAN PAST
AND THREW THE PURSE IN.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.073
A GUY WEARING
A BASEBALL HAT.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.176
AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION THIS
BEFORE BECAUSE...

27:57.209 --> 27:58.244
HE'S MENTIONING IT NOW,

27:58.277 --> 27:59.445
SO IF YOU BRING IN
A REAL SUSPECT,

27:59.478 --> 28:01.180
HE CAN IDENTIFY HIM.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.249
DICK FOUND
AN INTERESTING NEW CANDIDATE.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.818
ANTON THIBODEAUX,
MARGA'S NUMBER ONE FAN.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.887
THE GUY'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN
AROUND J.S.C.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.023
HE GOT BUSTED LAST YEAR
FOR TRESPASSING IN FLORIDA

28:11.057 --> 28:12.792
OUTSIDE THE ASTRONAUT
HALL OF FAME.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.894
THIS ONE SAYS,
"SEE YOU IN NEW YORK, MARGA.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.428
LOVE, ANTON."

28:16.462 --> 28:18.264
SAW HIM OUTSIDE OUR HOTEL
ON FRIDAY.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.265
THINK HE'S STILL THERE?

28:19.298 --> 28:22.401
NOT SINCE HER DEATH,
BUT I KNOW WHERE HE WILL BE.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.773
(Stabler)
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE GUY?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.207
SIX-FOOT-PLUS, BEARD,

28:28.240 --> 28:29.742
DEFINITE WEIRDO VIBE.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.744
LET ME TAKE
A WILD GUESS.

28:31.778 --> 28:35.014
YEAH, THAT'S THIBODEAUX.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.182
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO LEFT,
I'LL GO RIGHT.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.752
AND THIS TIME, IF HE BOLTS,
DON'T PUNCH HIM.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.292
HEY, YOU GUYS SEEN THIS?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.794
THOSE ARE THE THREE
ASTRONAUTS.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.495
THE APOLLO ONES.
I GOT ALL THREE OF 'EM.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.063
I GOT 'EM.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.264
THAT'S WORTH A LOT OF MONEY,
YOU KNOW.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.966
HEY, HEY, YOU GUYS.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.434
YOU EVER SEEN THESE GUYS?

28:55.467 --> 28:56.769
THIS IS--
THAT'S GUS GRISHAM.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.170
HE WENT UP IN FLAMES.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.107
I GOT NEIL ARMSTRONG.
HE SPELLED IT N-I-E.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.141
BUT I THINK
HE SPELLED IT WRONG.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.882
UH...WELL.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.150
COLONEL FINLEY.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.252
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.123
OH, I KNEW YOU PEOPLE
WOULD FIND ME

29:17.156 --> 29:20.026
THE MOMENT I HEARD
THE AWFUL NEWS.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.061
YOU DO KNOW THAT...

29:22.094 --> 29:24.063
I SAW MARGA THE NIGHT
THAT SHE WAS KILLED.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.165
YOU--YOU ADMIT
YOU WERE AT THE HOTEL.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.802
WELL, OF COURSE.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.004
PLEASE. SIT.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.339
SIT.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.846
WE TALKED.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.580
SHE SIGNED MY BOOK.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.316
LOOK, I HAVE IT
RIGHT HERE.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.418
I HAVE ALL
THE ASTRONAUTS.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.955
I HAVE MANY
OF THE COSMONAUTS TOO.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.423
RIGHT HERE.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.425
BUT MARGA AND I...

29:53.459 --> 29:54.861
WELL, WE CORRESPONDED
REGULARLY.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.296
WELL, I-I KNOW THAT YOU...
WROTE TO HER.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.530
DID SHE WRITE YOU BACK?

29:58.564 --> 30:00.599
WELL, NO.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.868
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.936
NO, NO, SHE WAS
VERY, VERY BUSY.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.072
SHE WAS ALWAYS UP THERE
DOING VERY IMPORTANT WORK.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.874
WORK THAT I OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT

30:07.907 --> 30:09.141
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
THE PROPER CLEARANCES.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.877
NO OFFENSE.
OH, NONE TAKEN.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.479
WELL...MARGA AND I WERE...

30:13.512 --> 30:16.415
WE WERE VERY, VERY CLOSE.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.852
I WROTE HER 33 LETTERS
THIS LAST YEAR.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.588
I DON'T--I DON'T WRITE
ON THE EMAIL.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.391
'CAUSE I DON'T TRUST
THE EMAIL.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.059
SHE WAS...

30:27.093 --> 30:29.295
SHE WAS MY GOOD FRIEND.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.030
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK, DOC?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.298
HE FITS THE DESCRIPTION

30:32.331 --> 30:35.001
OF A MALE
IN A BALL CAP.

30:35.034 --> 30:38.004
STALKERS BECOME VIOLENT
WHEN THEY'RE REJECTED.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.405
THE WAY THAT HE TELLS IT,

30:39.438 --> 30:42.008
MARGA TREATED HIM
WITH RESPECT.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.943
HE'S OBSESSIVE, CLEARLY.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.345
BUT I'M NOT SEEING
THE NECESSARY VOLATILITY.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.348
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE
SUSPICIOUS AT THE HOTEL?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.020
NO.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.424
BUT WHOEVER DID THIS,

30:58.457 --> 31:00.459
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.995
HE TOOK MARGA
AWAY FROM ME.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.064
AND THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE
TO DO THAT.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.366
THAT'S A BIG,
BIG MISTAKE TO DO THAT.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.400
ANTON, LET'S SIT DOWN.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.302
MARGA AND I,

31:10.336 --> 31:12.905
WE WERE DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER!

31:12.939 --> 31:15.975
I DON'T LIKE
WHOEVER DID THIS!

31:16.008 --> 31:16.943
I COULD REALLY HURT--

31:16.976 --> 31:20.179
I COULD REALLY HURT
THE PERSON WHO HURT HER!

31:20.212 --> 31:21.914
IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.951
I UNDERSTAND.
THAT ENOUGH
VOLATILITY, DOC?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.352
WE'LL RUN A LINEUP

31:26.385 --> 31:28.921
AND SEE IF BECKWITH
CAN I.D.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.694
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME,
VINCE.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.597
LOOK AT EACH ONE.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.940
I DON'T SEE HIM.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.308
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
RECOGNIZE THE GUY

31:49.341 --> 31:50.476
WHO THREW THE PURSE
INTO THE DUMPSTER.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.677
AND I WOULD!

31:51.710 --> 31:53.512
VINCE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.681
HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA SAY IT?!

31:55.714 --> 31:58.384
NONE OF THEM IS THE GUY!

31:58.417 --> 32:01.053
MAY I HAVE A MOMENT
WITH MY CLIENT?

32:05.124 --> 32:06.392
HE'S PLAYING US.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.726
HE KILLED HER
IN A ROBBERY GONE WRONG.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.661
MAYBE, BUT WE CAN'T
HOLD THIBODEAUX.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.030
YOU SURE?

32:11.063 --> 32:12.698
HE'S A PRETTY ODD DUCK.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.433
WHO WE'VE GOT NOTHING

32:14.466 --> 32:16.402
BUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE ON.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.070
CUT HIM LOOSE.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.009
I-I DON'T WANNA LEAVE.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.044
LOOK, WE APPRECIATE YOUR
COOPERATION, MR. THIBODEAUX.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.512
BUT WE CAN HANDLE IT
FROM HERE, SO--

32:26.545 --> 32:28.247
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MARGA WAS MY GOOD FRIEND.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.649
I CAN HELP YOU FIND
THE MONSTER THAT DID THIS!

32:30.682 --> 32:32.084
LOOK, TELL HIM
TO KEEP AN EYE

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
ON THE FOLKS AT
THE HALL OF SCIENCE FOR US.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.354
OKAY.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.489
HEY, ANTON.
MY FRIEND.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.159
LET ME BEND YOUR EAR
DOWN THE HALL FOR A SEC, HUH?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.995
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW
YOU CAN HELP US OUT.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.030
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

32:44.063 --> 32:46.465
TAKE ANOTHER SHOT
AT BECKWITH?

32:46.498 --> 32:48.000
HEY, OLIVIA.

32:48.034 --> 32:51.103
DICKIE?

32:51.137 --> 32:53.039
LOOK HOW TALL YOU ARE!

32:53.072 --> 32:54.006
RIGHT?
YEAH.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.741
AND I KIND OF
GO BY DICK.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.109
COURSE YOU DO.

32:57.143 --> 32:57.743
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.378
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

32:59.411 --> 33:00.579
I WANTED HIM TO DROP BY.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.148
SO HE COULD MEET THE MAN
THAT HE'S NAMED AFTER.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.582
COLONEL!

33:03.615 --> 33:05.617
COLONEL, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

33:05.651 --> 33:07.219
OH, LET ME GUESS.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.621
KID AS HANDSOME AS THIS
GOTTA BE NAMED DICK.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.258
DICK STABLER,
MEET COLONEL DICK FINLEY.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.259
IT'S AN HONOR, SIR.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.693
AH, IT'S ALL MINE.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.029
YOUR DAD TOLD ME
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.498
SO ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO THE MOON?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.600
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HERE'S THE LAUNCH VEHICLE

33:21.633 --> 33:22.734
THAT'S TAKING ME.

33:22.768 --> 33:23.769
NOW, WHEN YOUR TEACHER'S

33:23.802 --> 33:24.870
TALKING ABOUT THAT
IN CLASS,

33:24.903 --> 33:27.473
YOU TELL 'EM YOU KNOW
THE GOOD-LOOKIN' SON OF A BITCH

33:27.506 --> 33:29.175
THAT'S GONNA FLY THAT THING.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.509
YOU!

33:30.542 --> 33:32.544
YOU KILLED MY FRIEND!

33:35.314 --> 33:36.782
GET OUT!
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN!

33:36.815 --> 33:39.085
ANTON, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

33:39.118 --> 33:40.252
I DID IT!
I GOT HIM!

33:40.286 --> 33:42.088
THIBODEAUX, DROP THE GUN!

33:42.121 --> 33:43.189
NOW!

33:43.222 --> 33:46.058
DROP YOUR WEAPON NOW!

33:46.092 --> 33:48.060
[struggling]

33:48.094 --> 33:49.195
[gunshot]

33:54.633 --> 33:56.702
SOMEBODY CALL A BUS.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.752
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START ON MY REPORT.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.754
I'M GONNA DO MINE TOMORROW.
I GOTTA GET MY BOY HOME.

34:15.787 --> 34:16.755
GO.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.291
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

34:19.325 --> 34:22.328
YOU KEPT A BLOOD BATH
FROM GETTING A LOT WORSE.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.463
I JUST SAW THE GUN
AND REACTED.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.398
WE'D ALL BE LUCKY
TO REACT THAT FAST.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.767
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW
THE HELL YOU GUYS DO THIS.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.802
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO SOMETHING SAFE,

34:30.836 --> 34:33.105
LIKE FLYING ROCKETS.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.507
(Munch)
NOT SO FAST, COLONEL.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.876
AUTOGRAPH FOR A FAN?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.778
YEAH, YOU BET, JOHN.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.713
THANK YOU.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.582
APPRECIATE IT.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.156
IN CASE I'M WRONG.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.424
I THINK IT JUST
STARTED SNOWING IN HELL.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.593
[bell dings]

34:54.626 --> 34:56.162
WELL, DETECTIVE.

34:56.195 --> 34:56.962
OHH.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.364
IT WAS REAL NICE
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.500
YOU HAVE A CUT
ON YOUR HEAD.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.136
YOU KNOW WHAT, LIV?

35:04.170 --> 35:07.673
I GOT A MARINE CORPS FUNCTION
I GOTTA GO TO TONIGHT.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.775
BE A LOT MORE FUN
IF YOU WERE THERE.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.377
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.380
YOU'RE DOUBTING THE WORD
OF A LEGENDARY ASTRONAUT?

35:16.448 --> 35:18.784
I WOULD LOVE TO GO.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.354
SHOULD I CALL ELLIOT
AND SEE IF HE CAN JOIN US?

35:22.388 --> 35:26.425
OH, I THINK YOU AND ME
CAN HANDLE THIS.

35:26.458 --> 35:30.762
MEET YOU AT THE HOTEL
AROUND 8:00?

35:30.796 --> 35:31.763
OKAY.

35:31.797 --> 35:32.831
OKAY.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.272
(Stabler)
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE
ALL THAT.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.740
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

35:41.773 --> 35:43.575
YEAH.
IT WAS KIND OF SCARY.

35:43.609 --> 35:44.743
BUT I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING GROSS.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.445
AND I GOT
TO MEET THE COLONEL.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.513
YEAH, HE'S A PRETTY
COOL GUY, HUH?

35:47.546 --> 35:48.747
HOW MANY
OF YOUR FRIENDS CAN SAY

35:48.780 --> 35:50.216
THEY WERE NAMED
AFTER AN ASTRONAUT?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.517
HE'S LIKE YOUR HERO,
ISN'T HE?

35:51.550 --> 35:53.785
MM, TILL YOU CAME ALONG.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.321
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TRY TO BE LIKE HIM?

35:55.354 --> 35:58.357
GO INTO SPACE TOO?

35:58.390 --> 35:59.525
I DID TRY.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.327
YOU KNOW,
YOUR GRANDPA AND ME,

36:01.360 --> 36:04.663
WE, UM...
BUTTED HEADS A LOT.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.298
YOU KNOW, DICK KIND OF
TOOK ME UNDER HIS WINGS.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.699
HE'S THE REASON WHY
I JOINED THE CORPS.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.302
YOU KNOW,
APPLIED TO O.C.S.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.338
HE EVEN PULLED SOME STRINGS
TO GET ME INTO FLIGHT TRAINING.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.472
BUT I, UH...

36:13.505 --> 36:14.773
CHICKENED OUT?

36:14.806 --> 36:16.708
NO, IT'S MORE LIKE
I SAW WHAT I ALREADY HAD.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.377
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM...

36:18.410 --> 36:20.246
MAUREEN ON THE WAY.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.313
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
GOT MARRIED

36:21.347 --> 36:23.815
AFTER YOU GOT OUT
OF THE MARINES.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.752
DUDE, YOU KNOCKED UP MOM?

36:26.785 --> 36:29.388
MY POINT IS THAT...

36:29.421 --> 36:32.291
IT WASN'T ABOUT ME
BEING A FIGHTER PILOT ANYMORE.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.360
I MEAN, I HAD A WIFE
AND NEW BABY ON THE WAY.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.761
I WASN'T EVEN 20 YEARS OLD.

36:35.794 --> 36:39.598
SO IT WAS EITHER...
FOLLOW MY DREAM

36:39.631 --> 36:40.699
OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.434
YOU KNOW, UH...

36:42.468 --> 36:44.002
YEAH, I WANTED
TO BE LIKE DICK.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.438
BUT, UH...

36:46.472 --> 36:49.441
NOT AS MUCH AS I WANTED
TO DO RIGHT BY OUR FAMILY.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.009
THAT MAKE SENSE?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.010
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.545
FLYING JETS
WOULD BE TOO COOL.

36:53.579 --> 36:54.980
AND GOING TO THE MOON.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.415
YOU'D GIVE UP YOUR FAMILY
FOR THAT?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.449
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO GET THERE.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.450
OH, REALLY?
ANYTHING?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.452
DAD, ANYBODY WOULD.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.633
[knock on door]

37:14.666 --> 37:15.901
HEY, ELLIOT.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.636
WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.271
BET YOU WEREN'T.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.439
HEY, DO YOU MIND?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.573
HUH?

37:21.607 --> 37:23.309
YOU! TIME TO LEAVE.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.310
[grunting]

37:24.343 --> 37:25.311
ALL RIGHT, HERE.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.712
WHOA! HEY!

37:26.745 --> 37:27.913
THIS YOURS?
HERE.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.448
DICK...
BYE-BYE.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.982
HON, I'M SORRY.
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.322
WELL...

37:36.355 --> 37:37.689
THAT WAS,
UH, AWKWARD, HUH?

37:37.723 --> 37:40.492
OKAY, OKAY.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.527
I'M SORRY ABOUT OLIVIA.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.528
YOU KNOW,

37:42.561 --> 37:43.929
I SHOULD HAVE
CHECKED WITH YOU

37:43.962 --> 37:46.398
BEFORE ASKING HER
OUT TO DINNER.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.600
I MEAN...IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA MAKE A MOVE.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.669
DINNER WITH OLIVIA'S OFF.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.004
I THINK THAT'S UP TO HER
TO DECIDE.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.474
DON'T YOU?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.409
SO EXCUSE ME.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.378
I GOTTA GET DRESSED.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.746
DICK, I KNOW.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.714
KNOW WHAT?

38:02.748 --> 38:04.783
YOUR GAME.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.787
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:08.820 --> 38:10.556
YOU RAN POINT
FOR US, ALL RIGHT.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.790
YOU POINTED US
TO MARGA'S GIRLFRIEND

38:11.823 --> 38:13.525
AND HER CREWMATE...

38:13.559 --> 38:17.963
AND WHEN THAT JUNKIE SAID
HE SAW A GUY WITH A BALL CAP...

38:17.996 --> 38:19.565
YOU POINTED US
TO THIBODEAUX,

38:19.598 --> 38:21.600
KNOWING YOU COULD WIND
THAT NUT JOB UP

38:21.633 --> 38:23.435
AND PULL THE PIN.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.337
LOOK, IF YOU GOT SOMETHIN'
TO SAY, MARINE,

38:25.371 --> 38:27.406
SAY IT...OR GET OUT.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.675
TELL ME WHY
YOU MURDERED HER.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.877
I NEVER MURDERED ANYBODY.

38:31.910 --> 38:32.878
NO, NO MORE LIES.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.112
YOU OWE ME
AT LEAST THAT MUCH!

38:34.145 --> 38:35.714
I OWE YOU SOMETHING?

38:35.747 --> 38:38.350
I LOOKED UP TO YOU.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.619
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.892
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE JUST
CALM DOWN!

38:46.925 --> 38:48.660
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL NUTS.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.462
I'M YOUR FRIEND, ELLIOT.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.063
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.400
THEN YOU COME AND BARGE
IN HERE WITH ALL THESE

38:54.433 --> 38:56.802
WILD ACCUSATIONS.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.871
COME ON,
HAVE A DRINK, HUH?

38:59.905 --> 39:02.374
WHAT WAS IT?

39:02.408 --> 39:05.644
AFRAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA
BE THE HOTSHOT ANYMORE?

39:05.677 --> 39:07.479
WAIT.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.080
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO WASHED OUT.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.115
YOU KNEW YOU WERE
ABOUT TO,

39:10.148 --> 39:11.182
HEADING UP
THAT LUNAR RETURN.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.385
YOU KNOW THAT WAS JUST
A BONE THEY WERE THROWING YOU.

39:13.419 --> 39:14.453
THAT WAS AN EMPTY TITLE.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.656
I MEAN, 2018.
THAT'S A LONG WAY AWAY.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.424
IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS
TO COPS?

39:18.457 --> 39:19.891
EVERYBODY
BECOMES SUSPICIOUS?

39:19.925 --> 39:21.560
MARGA JANTZEN,
LUNAR EXPERT--

39:21.593 --> 39:22.694
AH, SHE'S A ROOKIE.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.397
SHE'S NASA'S NEW HOTSHOT.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.666
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T TRY TO BECOME ME!

39:27.699 --> 39:29.535
BECAUSE YOU NEVER
WOULD HAVE MADE IT!

39:29.568 --> 39:31.437
THAT NIGHT
AT MARGA'S HOTEL--

39:31.470 --> 39:33.038
WHAT PISSED YOU OFF SO MUCH?

39:33.071 --> 39:36.174
WAS IT BECAUSE SHE WAS YOUNG?

39:36.207 --> 39:38.477
SHE WAS GONNA TAKE
YOUR JOB IN HOUSTON?

39:38.510 --> 39:40.011
OR WAS IT WHEN
YOU SWEET-TALKED HER,

39:40.045 --> 39:42.448
IT WAS JUST FALLING FLAT
'CAUSE SHE WAS A LESBIAN?

39:42.481 --> 39:43.782
GET THE HELL OUT.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.083
SO YOU GRABBED HER,

39:45.116 --> 39:46.752
BUT YOUR REFLEXES
AREN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.687
AND ALL YOU GOT
WAS A NECKLACE.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.622
DAMN IT, STABLER,
I'M GONNA THROW YOU THROUGH--

39:50.656 --> 39:53.425
WHY ARE YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ON THE NECKLACE?!

39:57.496 --> 39:58.964
IT'S A PERFECT MATCH
TO THE ONE THAT YOU LEFT

39:58.997 --> 40:01.567
ON THE MODEL ROCKET.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.035
THE LAB JUST
CONFIRMED IT FOR ME.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.737
IT'S NOT THE JUNKIE'S.
IT'S YOURS.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.808
WELL, IF YOU AREN'T
SOME KIND OF LITTLE PISS-ANT!

40:09.841 --> 40:11.743
YOU KNOW, I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE LIFTED A FINGER FOR YOU!

40:11.777 --> 40:12.811
ARGH!

40:13.845 --> 40:15.914
SHE WAS GONNA TAKE
THE MOON FROM ME.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.749
OHH!

40:17.783 --> 40:19.117
HYUH!

40:19.150 --> 40:20.586
UHH!

40:23.655 --> 40:25.156
ARGH!

40:31.029 --> 40:34.733
GET UP.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.602
I SAID GET UP.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.638
[grunting]

40:39.671 --> 40:40.772
OHH.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.708
COME ON, ELLIOT.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.744
HEY, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO GO DOWN THIS WAY.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.213
WE CAN SOLVE THIS.

40:48.246 --> 40:49.715
TWO MARINES, HUH?

40:49.748 --> 40:50.882
WORKIN' TOGETHER.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.083
YOU MURDERED THAT WOMAN.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.752
YOU DUMPED HER BODY
IN THE RIVER.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.890
YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO SHAKE MY BOY'S HAND!

41:07.198 --> 41:09.234
[groans]

41:41.833 --> 41:43.501
(Benson)
ELLIOT.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.681
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

41:59.685 --> 42:00.952
NO.
