00:20.806 --> 00:24.350
[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:11.457 --> 02:14.127
[man] Why do you keep
looking out the window, Will?

02:15.754 --> 02:17.214
You like the snow?

02:20.175 --> 02:24.971
You know, for some people,
snow brings on a very specific feeling.

02:25.055 --> 02:26.556
Uh, some love it.

02:27.432 --> 02:33.479
It feels clean and pure, like a...
fresh start or a beginning.

02:35.232 --> 02:36.942
For others, it's frightening.

02:38.902 --> 02:42.447
Cold and silent and... isolating.

02:44.741 --> 02:47.452
What are you thinking about
when you look at the snow?

02:48.369 --> 02:50.205
That I'm gonna have to shovel it.

02:50.289 --> 02:51.539
[soft chuckle]

02:57.587 --> 03:01.174
Will, I'm gonna talk to you...
like I would talk to an adult,

03:01.258 --> 03:03.343
because I think
you're a very intelligent young man

03:03.426 --> 03:07.347
and you are capable
of understanding what I'm saying.

03:09.141 --> 03:13.353
In group dynamics, there's something
psychologists call "savior behavior."

03:13.436 --> 03:15.438
Often one person in the group feels...

03:16.439 --> 03:19.859
like they need to save the others
from a threat or an emotion

03:19.943 --> 03:21.903
that he or she believes is dangerous.

03:23.363 --> 03:29.535
Sometimes those people... are children
of parents with drug and alcohol problems.

03:30.662 --> 03:33.039
These people have had to...
save themselves

03:33.123 --> 03:36.459
from the emotional consequences
of their parents' addiction.

03:41.298 --> 03:43.549
Your father was unable
to find Sara Patrell

03:43.633 --> 03:45.510
and you wanted to help him, didn't you?

03:46.636 --> 03:50.390
And that's a perfectly
normal response, Will.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.476
You wanted to help,
that's a good thing.

03:55.478 --> 03:59.732
But sometimes when we try to help
one person, another person gets hurt.

04:00.775 --> 04:04.487
Sometimes that person's ourselves,
sometimes it's someone else.

04:04.570 --> 04:08.741
And I know your intentions...
weren't to hurt anyone,

04:08.825 --> 04:11.203
but when you say you can see Sara...

04:12.996 --> 04:15.123
or her ghost and talk to her,

04:15.207 --> 04:17.376
it causes people a lot of pain.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.920
Especially Sara's parents,

04:21.004 --> 04:25.758
who are dealing with the worst thing
a parent can go through.

04:31.390 --> 04:34.226
Now, I've been as honest
as I can with you, Will.

04:36.853 --> 04:38.563
Can you do the same for me?

04:44.569 --> 04:46.154
Are you still seeing Sara?

04:54.204 --> 04:55.580
Shh.

04:59.542 --> 05:00.877
No.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.837
- [intercom dings]
- [woman] Welcome to Iceland.

05:02.921 --> 05:06.216
Please remain seated with your seat belts
fastened until we reach the gate,

05:06.299 --> 05:09.261
and the captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

05:13.306 --> 05:15.225
[Riley panting]

05:20.355 --> 05:23.108
Oh... I'm so cold.

05:24.443 --> 05:25.360
Mm.

05:27.153 --> 05:29.655
- It's as high as it'll go.
- [exhales]

05:30.449 --> 05:31.616
[Magnus] Here...

05:32.992 --> 05:33.910
take my coat.

05:33.993 --> 05:37.538
[gasps, exhales]
No, no, no, no, no, you need that.

05:37.622 --> 05:40.833
I'm hot-blooded.
Don't worry.

05:41.751 --> 05:43.128
I want to keep you both warm.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.670
Here.

05:46.339 --> 05:48.467
[gasps, cries out]

05:48.549 --> 05:51.177
- Oh, it hurts! A lot.
- I know.

05:51.261 --> 05:54.306
[sighs] They're coming faster. Oh...

05:54.389 --> 05:58.518
Don't worry, sweetie, I'll get us there.
Just-- Just hang on.

06:00.937 --> 06:03.689
[wind howling]

06:08.320 --> 06:10.989
[groaning, inhales sharply]

06:11.072 --> 06:12.407
[groans]

06:12.491 --> 06:14.909
What were we thinking with that midwife?

06:14.993 --> 06:16.702
It was a stupid mistake.

06:16.786 --> 06:21.040
No, it's not her.
It's me. It's the hex.

06:21.124 --> 06:25.044
- I'm hexed. [panting]
- I've told you, it's not the hex.

06:25.128 --> 06:26.587
You're magic.

06:26.671 --> 06:29.090
You're the most magical thing

06:29.174 --> 06:30.967
- that has ever happened to me.
- [laughs]

06:32.885 --> 06:35.596
I'll get us there, I promise.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.390
[cries out]

06:37.474 --> 06:38.933
[both gasp]

06:40.143 --> 06:41.144
[Riley gasps]

06:43.855 --> 06:45.190
[Riley cries out]

06:48.276 --> 06:49.319
[Riley screams]

06:55.116 --> 06:57.702
[wind howling]

07:07.462 --> 07:08.629
[Magnus whispers] Riley.

07:09.714 --> 07:11.132
Magnus.

07:11.216 --> 07:15.470
Riley... come with me.

07:15.554 --> 07:17.430
[gasps softly]

07:22.519 --> 07:25.063
Magnus? [panting]

07:26.565 --> 07:27.732
[moans]

07:28.483 --> 07:30.443
[gasps, panting]

07:38.535 --> 07:40.161
[groans]

07:40.245 --> 07:42.414
[gasps, panting]

07:44.707 --> 07:45.708
Magnus...

07:46.834 --> 07:47.960
Magnus.

07:49.754 --> 07:51.797
[whimpers, sobs]

07:51.881 --> 07:54.300
Magnus... no.

08:00.973 --> 08:02.434
Magnus...

08:07.480 --> 08:09.023
Oh, no.

08:10.483 --> 08:11.568
[sniffling]

08:11.651 --> 08:13.319
[screams]

08:13.403 --> 08:15.113

09:13.463 --> 09:17.175
[crying]

09:48.456 --> 09:49.832
[sniffling]

09:51.376 --> 09:52.752
Oh, my Lúna.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.046
My Lúna.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.301
[sniffling] Someone's coming for us.

10:02.679 --> 10:03.846
It'll be OK.

10:03.929 --> 10:05.682
[whispers] Someone's coming.

10:09.435 --> 10:11.187
[sighs] Will.

10:12.689 --> 10:14.482
[whispers] I'm coming for you.

10:23.658 --> 10:25.535
I have bad news and worse news.

10:25.618 --> 10:27.828
- Start with the bad.
- I found out where they're taking her.

10:27.912 --> 10:30.498
A research facility
controlled by BPO up the coast.

10:30.582 --> 10:31.874
- That's good.
- Not really.

10:31.957 --> 10:34.877
It's very heavily secured,
but I'm working on a way in.

10:37.129 --> 10:38.130
OK, give me the worse news.

10:38.214 --> 10:40.174
A private plane
was just cleared for landing

10:40.258 --> 10:42.968
with a single passenger on board,
Dr. Ellison.

10:43.052 --> 10:44.470
- Whispers.
- It's gotta be him.

10:44.554 --> 10:46.138
- I'm ahead of him.
- Not for long.

10:46.222 --> 10:48.600
A helicopter is there
waiting to pick him up.

10:48.683 --> 10:51.811
- I'm gonna need some transportation.
- Car's just confirmed.

10:52.395 --> 10:53.229
It's there.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.277
- Are you Will Gorski?
- Yes, I am.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.528
Welcome to Iceland.

11:01.404 --> 11:02.280
Please, sign here.

11:03.155 --> 11:04.865
When did I get expensive taste?

11:04.949 --> 11:07.076
When I got access
to Metzger's credit cards.

11:07.159 --> 11:08.035
Ha!

11:08.119 --> 11:09.454
Enjoy the stay.

11:12.248 --> 11:13.916
The facility isn't on any map,

11:13.999 --> 11:16.669
but I've loaded the coordinates
into the GPS.

11:16.753 --> 11:18.421
It says that you can be there in 20.

11:18.504 --> 11:20.131
- I'll be there in ten.
- [engine revs]

13:45.818 --> 13:47.111
[stops singing]

13:52.241 --> 13:53.868
[gasping]

14:05.087 --> 14:06.714
[whispers] I'm sorry.

14:10.259 --> 14:11.886
I'm sorry.

14:15.556 --> 14:17.767
I'm so sorry.

14:20.979 --> 14:22.605
[whispers] I won't leave you.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.485
[sniffling]

14:28.193 --> 14:30.446
I promise I won't leave you.

15:28.212 --> 15:30.923
My baby... where is she?

15:34.052 --> 15:36.345
[Yrsa]
You would have done anything for her.

15:37.889 --> 15:41.726
You would have
given your life for your baby.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.062
[whispers] Yes.

15:45.479 --> 15:49.233
This... is your last chance.

15:50.568 --> 15:52.277
Take it.

15:52.361 --> 15:54.279
Protect them.

16:01.913 --> 16:03.497
[overlapping shouts]

16:05.083 --> 16:05.917
Riley.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.501
[panting]

16:19.597 --> 16:21.099
[Yrsa, echoing] Protect them.

16:33.611 --> 16:34.695
[Will] Riley...

16:36.655 --> 16:37.907
please don't do it.

16:39.742 --> 16:41.119
I'm coming for you.

16:49.794 --> 16:51.420
Don't give up.

17:05.476 --> 17:07.352
[gasping]

17:10.397 --> 17:12.191
[groaning]

17:16.862 --> 17:18.322
[exhales]

17:24.745 --> 17:26.747
[Jonas] It might be the best thing
that could've happened.

17:26.831 --> 17:28.248
Why?

17:28.332 --> 17:30.918
She'll be unconscious
when Whispers arrives.

17:31.002 --> 17:32.003
Where is he now?

17:32.920 --> 17:35.547
He just climbed into the helicopter.
He knows you're here.

17:36.174 --> 17:37.508
Do you have a plan for getting in?

17:37.591 --> 17:40.260
I'm going with a nine-millimeter
tucked under my arm.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.909
[Sergei] Buffie doesn't trust you.

18:03.993 --> 18:06.537
He believes you know
what happened to Steiner.

18:07.955 --> 18:11.876
I've been trying to call my son
since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.

18:22.678 --> 18:24.638
Do you know where Steiner is?

18:26.431 --> 18:27.391
I do.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.060
Where?

18:29.935 --> 18:33.480
You told me you didn't
want to choose between him or me.

18:33.564 --> 18:35.440
Now you don't have to.

18:35.524 --> 18:37.442
Where is my son?!

18:37.526 --> 18:43.615
I'd give you details...
but you can ask him yourself very shortly.

18:43.699 --> 18:44.867
What?

18:46.827 --> 18:47.912
You fuck! [grunts]

19:21.695 --> 19:22.613
Careful.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.240
I heard the shots.

19:24.323 --> 19:27.285
I know the way a bullet sounds
when it hits Kevlar.

19:28.493 --> 19:30.370
The bodyguard's gun is gone.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.296
You son of a bitch!

19:38.378 --> 19:40.589
- [gunshots]
- Did you kill my son?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.469
[gunfire continues]

19:52.268 --> 19:55.062
[screaming]

19:55.146 --> 19:57.648
Kill that fucking cunt!

20:02.153 --> 20:03.362
[gunfire stops]

20:18.043 --> 20:18.877

[banging against door]

20:30.097 --> 20:31.807
[clicking]

20:45.529 --> 20:47.031
What is happening?

20:48.949 --> 20:50.575
I guess I've come to say goodbye.

20:50.659 --> 20:53.329
[rapid gunfire]

20:53.412 --> 20:54.705
This was your plan?

20:54.788 --> 20:57.208
How was I supposed to know
he'd be wearing a bulletproof vest?

20:57.291 --> 20:59.126
Who wears a bulletproof vest in real life?

21:01.920 --> 21:04.423
[banging against door]

21:05.465 --> 21:06.842
What are you doing?

21:07.718 --> 21:10.637
I'm not like Sun.
I do not know how to use my fists,

21:10.721 --> 21:13.932
but... that doesn't mean
I don't know how to fight.

21:14.766 --> 21:16.727
[bottles clattering]

21:16.810 --> 21:19.188
[banging continues]

21:43.379 --> 21:45.381
I am not ready to say goodbye.

21:57.393 --> 21:59.311
Oh, fuck!

22:27.756 --> 22:28.882
[groans]

22:34.138 --> 22:35.973
[wood creaking]

22:38.558 --> 22:40.311
[clicking]

22:49.611 --> 22:50.904
[slams gun down]

22:53.657 --> 22:55.159
Why, Wolfgang?

22:56.201 --> 22:57.661
Why?

22:58.578 --> 22:59.830
You're family.

23:00.872 --> 23:02.249
We raised you.

23:04.543 --> 23:08.464
What kind of man
betrays his own fucking family?

23:12.676 --> 23:17.556
You said that you would have given
everything to know who killed my father.

23:21.852 --> 23:23.187
I give you that gift.

23:34.532 --> 23:36.408

23:54.218 --> 23:56.845
- [Wolfgang grunts]
- [neck cracks]

24:26.791 --> 24:28.460
Oh, God.

24:31.505 --> 24:32.381
Why?

24:33.465 --> 24:34.799
You know why.

24:36.176 --> 24:37.469
You always knew.

24:39.555 --> 24:42.015
And still, you did nothing.

24:43.350 --> 24:45.977
Wolfgang, I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

24:46.061 --> 24:48.230
I'm so sor-- sorry. I--

24:48.313 --> 24:49.648
Please...

24:51.149 --> 24:52.443
forgive me.

24:53.985 --> 24:59.074
You said... your blood is in my blood.

25:00.992 --> 25:02.702
So is his.

25:06.331 --> 25:10.335
My father... was a monster.

25:12.463 --> 25:14.131
And so are you.

25:14.798 --> 25:15.924
And so am I.

25:22.847 --> 25:24.308
[sighs]

25:32.816 --> 25:35.026
That's why you have to marry Rajan.

25:40.157 --> 25:41.366
[gun clatters]

26:34.127 --> 26:35.546
- Damn it!
- [Nomi] Stop the car.

26:35.629 --> 26:36.755
What?

26:36.838 --> 26:38.382
- No, no, no. That's him.
- I know.

26:38.465 --> 26:39.966
Whispers is going to get there first.

26:40.050 --> 26:43.721
He's already told security to be
looking for you. You need a distraction.

26:43.803 --> 26:44.929
Stop the car.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.602
Engine's in the back.
Oil line's along the driver's side.

26:51.853 --> 26:54.314
Pop the trunk.
Find the oil line.

26:54.398 --> 26:55.399
Break it.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.568
- It'll destroy the car.
- I know.

26:57.651 --> 27:00.362
It was Amanita's idea.
It's why we picked this car.

27:00.862 --> 27:03.114
Men cannot stand
to see a beautiful car in trouble.

27:03.198 --> 27:06.451
It's some kind of primal instinct.
Look at you, you're hesitating.

27:06.535 --> 27:08.579
- It's a really nice car.
- See?

27:09.371 --> 27:10.539
[sighs]

27:12.957 --> 27:14.543
[hissing]

27:14.626 --> 27:16.169
[tires squealing]

27:16.253 --> 27:17.962
[Will]
What am I supposed to use to get away?

27:18.046 --> 27:21.216
You're the one that jumped on
the first plane to Iceland without a plan.

27:21.299 --> 27:23.427
We're working on an exit strategy.

27:23.510 --> 27:26.388
How about this guy?
He's on vacation.

27:26.471 --> 27:28.306
In the meantime,
I think we found a way inside.

27:28.390 --> 27:30.975
We've been combing through
the employee records, looking for a shell.

27:31.059 --> 27:33.562
- I'm cooking the ID now.
- [Nomi] We'll send it when it's crispy.

27:33.645 --> 27:36.356
You should be able to wave your phone
and just walk right in.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.441
Seriously?

27:37.524 --> 27:39.067
It's a square-cube law thing.

27:39.150 --> 27:43.530
Bigger and more high tech a company is,
the easier it is to use the front door.

27:49.369 --> 27:50.995
What about Riley?

27:51.079 --> 27:52.456
I assume since none of us can reach her

27:52.539 --> 27:54.833
that she's still unconscious,
which means that she's safe.

27:54.916 --> 27:56.710
Safe? Here?

28:01.172 --> 28:04.509
Could you explain the whole "don't look
him in the eye" bad guy thing again?

28:05.176 --> 28:06.303
I--

28:06.386 --> 28:08.012
I mean, 'cause I saw him.

28:08.096 --> 28:11.642
I was afraid to look at him at first,
but... then I did.

28:12.142 --> 28:14.519
Does that mean
he can see inside my mind now, too?

28:14.603 --> 28:16.229
No, no, no. Jonas explained it.

28:16.313 --> 28:18.064
- No, he's like us.
- He's sensate.

28:18.148 --> 28:20.984
- He can only connect with other sensate.
- So she's safe.

28:22.527 --> 28:26.824
Except for the fact that a man that uses
zombies to murder people knows who she is,

28:26.906 --> 28:28.325
the police are looking for her,

28:28.408 --> 28:30.744
she's using equipment
that could get her 20 years in prison,

28:30.828 --> 28:33.371
all while aiding and abetting
her fugitive lover.

28:33.455 --> 28:34.748
Is that what you mean by "safe"?

28:34.832 --> 28:36.834
Hey, Nom, it's OK.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.877
You love her a lot.

28:40.796 --> 28:44.966
In my book...
safety's always been highly overrated.

28:47.803 --> 28:51.181
- [sighs] Such a shame.
- It's a '14.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.767
It's only a year old, man.

29:04.277 --> 29:06.446
Oh, hey, man. You've gotta see it.
It's totally fucked up.

29:06.530 --> 29:07.531
[man] Oh, my God!

29:09.574 --> 29:11.576
- I still got nothing here.
- It's on its way.

29:13.495 --> 29:15.580
- You sure this is gonna work?
- [Nomi] It'll work.

29:16.748 --> 29:18.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:18.834 --> 29:20.878
Your name is Fred Sloughman.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.003
Fred Sloughman.

29:22.086 --> 29:23.714
Consolidated Medical Waste.

29:23.797 --> 29:27.258
Consolidated Medical Waste,
here to check out your... medical waste.

29:27.342 --> 29:29.093
- You been cleared?
- Yeah, right here.

29:32.222 --> 29:33.181
[rapid beeping]

29:33.264 --> 29:34.516
- It's not working.
- Step over here.

29:34.599 --> 29:35.975
- [Will] I don't understand.
- Um...

29:36.059 --> 29:37.602
Step to the side.

29:38.186 --> 29:39.062
It's not working.

29:39.938 --> 29:42.649
- It should.
- Um...

29:42.733 --> 29:44.526
- Turn up the brightness.
- Just a second.

29:45.402 --> 29:46.403
Try it again?

29:50.782 --> 29:51.616
[beeps]

29:52.242 --> 29:54.536
- Sorry.
- Technology, huh?

29:57.915 --> 29:59.332
[exhales]

30:00.166 --> 30:02.920
Her blood pressure's dropping.
I can barely read her heartbeat.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.714
Riley, open your eyes.

30:07.549 --> 30:10.093
When I give instructions,
I expect them to be followed.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.430
She went berserk. She grabbed a gun.
I had to use Rocuronium to put her down.

30:13.513 --> 30:15.265
I want this woman conscious
as soon as possible.

30:15.348 --> 30:17.350
She's no use to me in this condition.

30:17.434 --> 30:19.519
If we're not careful,
she could go into anaphylactic shock.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.606
You didn't expect this, did you?

30:22.689 --> 30:24.315
Have you made a mistake?

30:28.737 --> 30:30.113
Wake her up, now.

30:35.076 --> 30:36.411
[Will] This place is huge.

30:36.494 --> 30:38.622
- Know where she's being held?
- No.

30:38.705 --> 30:41.082
- Why not?
- I'm not the Wizard of Oz.

30:41.165 --> 30:44.002
I only have access to what's in their
computer system and she's not in here.

30:44.085 --> 30:45.545
- How do I find her?
- [Lito] I'll find her.

30:45.629 --> 30:46.755
Lito.

30:48.465 --> 30:49.299
Don't worry.

30:49.382 --> 30:50.884
- Do I know you?
- Yeah.

30:52.469 --> 30:53.553
We had sex.

30:55.013 --> 30:58.016
Wha-- Oh. Uh...

30:59.142 --> 31:02.395
- [stammers] Eh... It-- That was--
- Very special.

31:02.479 --> 31:05.941
Oh, hey... Uh...

31:07.651 --> 31:08.986
We're on a clock here, fellas.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.111
Follow me.

31:11.446 --> 31:13.573
- How will you find her?
- It's a secret.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.241
I'm very good at secrets.

31:17.201 --> 31:19.955
[Lito] Oh, my God... what a day.

31:22.666 --> 31:24.001
What a day.

31:25.627 --> 31:27.462
[sighs]

31:27.545 --> 31:30.089
- He can be difficult, can't he?
- [scoffs]

31:31.090 --> 31:32.884
You mean Dr. Ellison?

31:33.760 --> 31:35.386
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:36.471 --> 31:38.932
He told me that I should
pay attention to you because...

31:39.975 --> 31:41.643
he says you are very good.

31:41.726 --> 31:43.478
He has a lot of respect for you.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.356
Really?

31:47.357 --> 31:48.358
[chuckles]

31:49.567 --> 31:51.903
I thought he was about to fire me.

31:51.987 --> 31:54.405
- Welcome to my daily life.
- [chuckling]

31:55.699 --> 31:57.951
I don't know how you could stand it.

31:58.035 --> 32:00.954
Well... the work is important.

32:01.038 --> 32:02.998
Yeah, of course.

32:03.081 --> 32:07.460
Once in a while, I get to meet someone
who understands... how hard this job is.

32:07.544 --> 32:09.295
- Mm. Yeah, yeah.
- You know?

32:09.379 --> 32:11.089
And who happens to be very...

32:13.466 --> 32:14.592
very attractive.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.348
[laughing]

32:24.561 --> 32:26.063
[sighs]

32:26.897 --> 32:28.606
- I have to get back to work.
- Yeah.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.067
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:30.817 --> 32:33.111
- What room was she in again?
- Um...

32:33.194 --> 32:35.572
- Sixth floor, 620.
- Oh, yeah.

32:40.744 --> 32:42.286
Clever, Mr. Gorski.

32:43.246 --> 32:45.082
We don't know how he got clearance.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.833
Ms. Marks, no doubt.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.501
How's that exit strategy coming?

32:49.127 --> 32:51.170
- We're going to need some help.
- Whose help?

32:51.838 --> 32:52.672
Mine.

32:54.091 --> 32:56.927
What can you do to help us
without him knowing?

32:57.010 --> 32:59.763
In 12 minutes,
an ambulance is going to arrive,

32:59.846 --> 33:02.390
because someone who works here
is on our side...

33:02.473 --> 33:05.102
and is right now
pretending to have a heart attack.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.729
Where is Mr. Gorski?

33:09.147 --> 33:11.274
Sneaking away behind you.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.818
Double the security
around Ms. Gunnarsdóttir.

33:14.569 --> 33:17.321
- Sweep the facility.
- Done.

33:17.405 --> 33:19.365
I don't like games.

33:20.992 --> 33:24.203
That's a pity. I love them.

33:28.499 --> 33:31.377
- She's definitely on this floor.
- Got it.

33:31.461 --> 33:34.172
- The ambulance just arrived.
- Shit! Four guards.

33:34.255 --> 33:35.506
Is that all?

33:41.012 --> 33:42.680
Whispers knows where you are.

33:42.764 --> 33:44.057
Give him a message.

33:44.141 --> 33:48.227
If he thinks he can stop us,
he's going to need a lot more men.

33:48.311 --> 33:49.562
This area is off-limits.

33:51.148 --> 33:52.816
- [Sun grunts]
- [man screams]

33:57.570 --> 33:58.780
- [man shouts]
- Aah!

33:58.863 --> 34:01.365
- [all grunting]
- [man yells]

34:05.536 --> 34:06.370
[shouts, gasps]

34:25.932 --> 34:27.475
[Riley gasping]

35:01.968 --> 35:03.427
[gasping]

35:36.294 --> 35:37.921
Riley.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.381
It's me.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.052
[singing in Icelandic]

35:46.179 --> 35:47.638
[whispers] Will...

36:06.657 --> 36:07.909
Are you real?

36:17.043 --> 36:18.128
Left. Go left.

36:24.759 --> 36:27.262
I'm not gonna be able
to carry her out of here.

36:27.345 --> 36:28.972
- We have to wake her up.
- How?

36:29.055 --> 36:30.265
I don't know.

36:30.348 --> 36:31.308
[Kala] I do.

36:32.142 --> 36:33.392
[voice quavering] Set her down.

36:50.243 --> 36:54.580
Sugammadex is the only
safe recovery agent for Rocuronium.

36:57.667 --> 37:00.170
Combined with a little adrenaline...

37:03.298 --> 37:07.093
This will be very violent,
but it'll wake her.

37:15.559 --> 37:18.062
[gasping]

37:20.231 --> 37:21.440
[whispers] Will.

37:21.524 --> 37:23.401
- I'm here.
- [panting]

37:23.484 --> 37:25.903
- You shouldn't have come.
- Why?

37:25.987 --> 37:28.198
Because everyone around me dies.

37:30.908 --> 37:34.078
- [electricity surging]
- [groaning]

37:36.789 --> 37:40.710
- [whimpering]
- Now... Shh.

37:40.793 --> 37:44.255
- How are they planning on leaving?
- [grunts]

37:45.840 --> 37:46.966
Ah.

37:47.050 --> 37:49.135
The ambulance.

37:49.219 --> 37:50.928
Ambulance is parked in the garage.

37:51.012 --> 37:52.055
Take the elevator.

37:53.973 --> 37:55.892
No guns.
I want them alive.

38:05.318 --> 38:06.819
[elevator beeps]

38:26.547 --> 38:28.549
What is it? What's wrong?

38:30.051 --> 38:31.469
Hello, Will.

38:34.264 --> 38:35.973
Oh, no.

38:36.057 --> 38:37.350
[elevator beeps]

38:37.434 --> 38:40.270
Hey! No one can leave this building. Stop!

38:40.853 --> 38:41.979
[grunts]

38:45.108 --> 38:46.276
[man moans]

38:57.495 --> 38:58.662
Shit.

38:58.746 --> 39:01.165
Keys. Keys, keys, keys, keys.
There's no keys.

39:01.958 --> 39:03.167
This is not a problem.

39:04.585 --> 39:06.837
The Van Damn has been stolen many times...

39:07.838 --> 39:11.092
and you learn many tricks...
in order to steal it back.

39:12.218 --> 39:14.887
OK. Ah...

39:18.933 --> 39:20.684
[engine starts]

39:20.768 --> 39:21.936
Whoo!

39:22.019 --> 39:23.146
Easy.

39:34.824 --> 39:36.493
[helicopter blades whirring]

39:59.849 --> 40:02.059
Will, this is foolish.

40:02.143 --> 40:05.104
I see and hear
everything you see and hear.

40:05.188 --> 40:11.402
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
whatever you think... I will be with you.

40:20.995 --> 40:25.124
- Will... it's over. He's won.
- No.

40:27.751 --> 40:28.794
You're afraid.

40:28.878 --> 40:30.463
We're gonna get out of here.

40:31.881 --> 40:33.757
There is absolutely nowhere to hide.

40:33.841 --> 40:35.676
How are you supposed
to get away from a helicopter

40:35.759 --> 40:37.387
when there's just one long road?

40:39.930 --> 40:42.141
Oh, yeah, I got it. I got it!

40:43.059 --> 40:45.186
- A weather map?
- Helicopters fly by sight.

40:45.269 --> 40:46.479
They're not good in fog or rain.

40:46.563 --> 40:49.482
The weather changes drastically
with altitude, to lose these guys,

40:49.566 --> 40:52.360
- all they gotta do is head here.
- Oh, my God, I love you!

40:52.443 --> 40:55.572
Will, up ahead there's a road to the left.
Take it.

40:58.616 --> 41:00.326
[tires squealing]

41:09.877 --> 41:11.128
Will?

41:26.310 --> 41:27.853
Enough.

41:27.937 --> 41:29.522
I know you.

41:31.774 --> 41:33.443
You are a police officer.

41:33.526 --> 41:35.445
You are sworn to protect people.

41:39.949 --> 41:41.200
It's in your blood.

41:41.284 --> 41:42.535
It's in your heart.

41:45.663 --> 41:48.374
I know you won't kill us all.

41:51.669 --> 41:53.379
You can't do it.

41:54.838 --> 41:56.132
Maybe I can't...

41:57.133 --> 41:58.301
but I know who can.

42:07.101 --> 42:08.561
- [gasps]
- Pull up!

42:19.656 --> 42:21.532
- Oh, no.
- What?

42:21.616 --> 42:23.618
- We can't go this way.
- Why not?

42:24.952 --> 42:26.912
Please, don't take me there,
not to those mountains.

42:26.996 --> 42:29.290
- It's the only way.
- [gasping]

42:32.126 --> 42:33.377
- Will, please go back.
- Why?

42:33.461 --> 42:34.878
- Go back!
- We can't!

42:34.962 --> 42:36.088
Please!

42:41.511 --> 42:43.680
- [gasps, screams]
- [tires squealing]

42:45.764 --> 42:47.725
[gasping] Oh, no.

42:52.229 --> 42:54.940
- Oh, no, no, please don't take me back!
- Riley, what--

42:55.065 --> 42:56.734
- [moaning]
- [Will] What is it? What's wrong?

42:56.817 --> 42:58.569
[cries out]

42:58.653 --> 43:00.446
[Riley yelling]

43:00.530 --> 43:02.948
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

43:03.032 --> 43:05.326
[Will gasping]

43:05.409 --> 43:07.995
Oh, hurry up. [exhales sharply]

43:08.078 --> 43:09.830
[groaning]

43:13.792 --> 43:16.128
What? What's happening?

43:16.212 --> 43:17.880
I don't know.
I can't reach either one of them.

43:17.963 --> 43:21.133
They were there heading into the mountains
and... now they're gone.

43:28.391 --> 43:29.559
[door opening]

43:31.352 --> 43:32.645
[Will] Riley!

43:37.858 --> 43:39.193
Riley!

43:40.653 --> 43:41.987
[gasps]

43:45.324 --> 43:46.325
Riley!

43:57.461 --> 44:01.924
- [panting] Riley... are you OK?
- [sings softly in Icelandic]

44:02.007 --> 44:04.677
Stay with me.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

44:04.761 --> 44:06.637
We're gonna be all right.

44:08.931 --> 44:10.767
I wish that were true.

44:13.770 --> 44:15.854
But we both know it's not.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.902
Listen to me, Will.
You have very little time.

44:21.985 --> 44:24.905
Whispers is getting into a car.
He'll find you shortly.

44:24.988 --> 44:29.285
Once he has you, it won't be long
until he finds the rest of your cluster.

44:29.368 --> 44:31.537
There's only one way.

44:31.621 --> 44:32.996
[echoes] Protect them.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.959
It's the only way.

44:43.299 --> 44:45.676
[Will sobs]

44:45.760 --> 44:49.972
It's OK, Will.
I was supposed to die here.

45:14.330 --> 45:16.332
No. No.

45:16.999 --> 45:17.834
No.

45:18.835 --> 45:19.877
[gun thuds]

46:32.449 --> 46:33.492
Riley...

46:34.410 --> 46:36.286
Whispers saw me.

46:36.370 --> 46:37.955
He's in my head.

46:38.873 --> 46:39.957
As long as I'm unconscious,

46:40.040 --> 46:43.920
he can't see what I see.
That's why I shot up with all those drugs.

46:44.002 --> 46:45.922
In a minute,
I'm gonna be unconscious.

46:47.297 --> 46:51.385
Our only chance is if you get
in that ambulance and drive us outta here.

46:53.095 --> 46:54.012
Riley...

46:55.472 --> 46:56.640
if you don't...

46:58.267 --> 47:00.185
we're all gonna die.

47:00.937 --> 47:02.271
[whispers] I can't.

47:03.397 --> 47:04.607
I can't.

47:08.318 --> 47:10.153
I can't leave her.

47:11.989 --> 47:13.449
Riley, please.

47:14.491 --> 47:17.787
I'm so sorry, Will. I can't do it.

47:17.870 --> 47:19.663
[sobbing]

47:28.965 --> 47:30.716
I know how much it hurts.

47:32.969 --> 47:35.846
I know you want to lay down here
and never get up again.

47:35.930 --> 47:37.306
I know it, 'cause I feel it.

47:39.642 --> 47:41.685
[sobs] I can feel it.

47:45.439 --> 47:49.359
And that means that somehow,
somewhere...

47:53.363 --> 47:55.658
you can feel what I'm feeling, too.

48:00.329 --> 48:01.538
I love you.

48:04.333 --> 48:06.710
That's why you can't give up.

48:10.130 --> 48:11.715
I love you.

48:23.226 --> 48:24.812
[whispers] I love you.

48:25.479 --> 48:26.897
[softly] I love you.

48:28.357 --> 48:31.861
[fading] I love you... I love you...

48:44.623 --> 48:48.044
[sings softly in Icelandic]

48:59.972 --> 49:03.308
[acoustic rock song plays]

49:10.399 --> 49:11.316
Is he sick?

49:13.193 --> 49:14.444
No, he's OK.

49:23.453 --> 49:25.163
Everything's OK.

49:28.876 --> 49:30.377
[exhales]

49:37.676 --> 49:39.136
[whispers] You did it.

49:41.013 --> 49:42.514
You saved us.
