WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.634
Narrator: Now...

00:02.636 --> 00:04.036
Lisa: Woo!

00:04.038 --> 00:05.437
Narrator: On "ice road
truckers"...

00:05.439 --> 00:06.872
(hard thud)

00:06.874 --> 00:09.174
lisa: (bleep)! I can't stop
or I will be stuck.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.610
Darrell: Whoa!

00:11.612 --> 00:12.778
Narrator: As the season races
towards the finish line...

00:12.780 --> 00:15.214
Darrell: This ain't gonna
last long.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.116
Narrator: The trails fall
to pieces...

00:17.118 --> 00:19.118
Todd: What in the hell?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.619
That sucks.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.889
(ice cracks)
steph: Oh my god!

00:23.891 --> 00:25.324
Narrator: And the drivers...

00:25.326 --> 00:26.892
- This is (bleep)!

00:28.229 --> 00:30.262
Narrator: Are feeling the heat.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.897
Lisa: Oh (bleep)!

00:33.601 --> 00:48.380
♪ ♪

00:48.382 --> 01:02.461
♪ ♪

01:04.565 --> 01:07.099
narrator: Throughout the winter
road system,

01:07.101 --> 01:09.101
an early spring is looming.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.006
Opportunities for the drivers
are quickly becoming scarce...

01:15.342 --> 01:18.510
(truck rumbles,)
horn blasts)

01:22.683 --> 01:25.317
narrator: ...And at polar
headquarters in winnipeg...

01:25.319 --> 01:27.786
Mark: Hey, guys. Yeah,
just checking on that road.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.988
Do you know when we're going to
be able to get up in that area?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.125
Narrator: ...Owner mark
kohaykewych is scrambling.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.128
Mark: When you're faced
with an el nino year,

01:36.130 --> 01:39.298
I mean the challenges
are exponential.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.933
Drivers need to step up,

01:40.935 --> 01:43.469
you know, we can't afford
an, an extra minute

01:43.471 --> 01:45.337
never mind an extra day.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.705
(metallic clang)

01:46.707 --> 01:48.140
- I'm hooked in, baby.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.942
Narrator: The boss has gotta
capitalize

01:49.944 --> 01:52.010
on every open route
he can find.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.980
- It's good to go.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.648
Narrator: So, today,
he's taking a chance

01:56.650 --> 01:59.718
on the greenest driver he's got.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.887
- It's my first, uh,
my first solo trip.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.124
Mark: I got loads stacking up,
I got roads closing.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.292
Steph's gotta step up
and get out there on her own.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.264
Narrator: On her first
mission...

02:12.266 --> 02:14.299
(clanging thud)
- holy (bleep)!

02:16.137 --> 02:17.936
That knocked me
right out of gear.

02:17.938 --> 02:21.039
Narrator: ...Steph custance
was mentored by todd dewey.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.508
- Welcome to the ice road,
baby!

02:24.845 --> 02:26.378
Narrator: But even with the
company top dog at her side...

02:26.380 --> 02:27.813
(ice cracking)

02:29.216 --> 02:31.016
- you can hear the ice flexing.
Now I wanna get off.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.752
Narrator: ...Driving on ice

02:33.754 --> 02:35.954
was like nothing
she'd experienced before.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.023
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.491
(truck rumbles)

02:41.028 --> 02:42.427
I got lights here.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.197
Narrator: But now,

02:45.199 --> 02:47.766
with time running out
and loads piling up,

02:47.768 --> 02:51.370
mark's sending the 22-year-old
out on her own.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.771
- So I think it's really cool

02:52.773 --> 02:54.206
that mark trusts me enough
already and...

02:54.208 --> 02:55.574
And that he's letting me go out

02:55.576 --> 02:56.975
and giving me another
opportunity

02:56.977 --> 02:58.710
to prove myself even more.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.846
Yeah, my biggest concern
is just lack of knowledge.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.015
I mean, it's, I'm still new,
I'm still a green horn,

03:03.017 --> 03:04.483
so I have to be on my game.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.151
So let's hope I learned enough
from todd.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.155
Narrator: With only one
training run under her belt,

03:10.157 --> 03:12.991
it's time for the rookie
to earn her stripes.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.760
(door shuts,
engine rumbles)

03:14.762 --> 03:16.862
narrator: But this one
won't be easy.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.297
Steph: We're wheels up.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.066
Narrator: Steph will have
to haul

03:21.068 --> 03:23.635
a heavy 28-ton load
of building materials

03:23.637 --> 03:26.338
200 hundred miles
to pikangikum.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.208
But to get there
she'll have to battle

03:29.210 --> 03:32.444
one of the longest ice
crossings in ontario,

03:32.446 --> 03:34.813
stretching nearly ten miles.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.585
Steph: Finally on my way,
so we're gonna...

03:39.587 --> 03:41.053
Pray the good lord's with us

03:41.055 --> 03:42.554
and that we're good to go.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.989
Hammer down.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.427
Narrator: While polar hits
the trail with a newcomer,

03:49.863 --> 03:51.897
600 miles to the north...

03:53.367 --> 03:57.636
Darrell: All right,
I am in south indian lake.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.306
Narrator: ...The competition's
already banking a delivery.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.076
Darrell ward isn't backing away

04:04.078 --> 04:06.111
from the challenge
of a short winter.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.213
Darrell: You know, with the way
the weather is this year,

04:08.215 --> 04:11.350
I gotta get in as fast as I can
and get back out of there.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.452
I don't know when the road
will close.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.356
It's pretty heavy.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.424
Narrator: And today
he's attempting a mission
unlike any before

04:19.426 --> 04:23.228
by trying to complete three
deliveries in a single day.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.798
- I got one load going
to three destinations.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.667
This could be huge for me.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.335
(squeaking)

04:30.337 --> 04:31.870
one piece down.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.639
(door shuts)
all right.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.743
Narrator: The epic journey
starts in south indian lake

04:37.745 --> 04:40.712
then moves northwest
a hundred miles to lac brochet,

04:42.082 --> 04:43.482
and if successful,

04:43.484 --> 04:46.818
caps off with a 50 mile sprint
to brochet.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.491
(truck rumbles,
chains clink)

04:52.493 --> 04:55.727
- I've got school supplies
for three different communities.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.796
I've got two left to deliver,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.799
and I have another drop
in brochet

05:02.169 --> 05:04.803
and another drop
in lac brochet.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.606
So hopefully,

05:07.608 --> 05:10.175
by the time I'm done up here
in northern manitoba,

05:10.177 --> 05:11.743
I've scored three loads -

05:11.745 --> 05:13.545
got three more loads
under my belt.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.050
Narrator: For the small company
it's an ambitious undertaking,

05:18.052 --> 05:21.053
but it could be the best way
to utilize their two-man fleet.

05:22.389 --> 05:25.424
- Could be a new adventure
or a new disaster.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.028
As of tomorrow, they're gonna
start closing a lot of roads.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.132
It's a long ways in
and a long ways out,

05:34.134 --> 05:37.135
so no room for error today.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.806
Narrator: 400 miles
to the southeast,

05:42.142 --> 05:45.610
darrell's business partner's
got a big-money haul.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.214
- My truck's been taking
quite a beating.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.216
Narrator: Lisa kelly's nabbed
the last load

05:51.218 --> 05:52.617
into sandy lake for the season:

05:54.955 --> 05:57.823
A lucrative contract that could
be a windfall for the company.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.992
Lisa: I've got a vanload
of trap supplies

06:00.994 --> 06:04.062
and it's the last one that's
gonna be able to get into
sandy lake.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.464
So it needs to get there

06:05.466 --> 06:07.199
because this road
is falling apart.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.003
Narrator: But there's a good
reason for that high price tag.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.474
Warm weather's destroying
the road,

06:15.476 --> 06:17.843
turning it into
a 300 mile trail

06:17.845 --> 06:20.412
of nothing but mud and slush.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.914
Lisa: I need to get out before
they close down for good,

06:22.916 --> 06:24.983
so I'm gonna have to keep
the pace up.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.152
It's gonna be trying not
to get stuck in mud

06:27.154 --> 06:30.155
and trying not to get stuck
in snow and slush

06:31.525 --> 06:33.692
because there's no one else
out here to pull me out.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.696
It's really warm out,

06:37.698 --> 06:40.999
tundra showing through,
it's really slippery.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.235
We'll be mud-road trucking.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.471
Narrator: The muskeg's almost
completely melted down...

06:46.473 --> 06:48.507
- The farther I go
the softer it's getting.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.410
Narrator: ...And it's taking
everything lisa's got

06:51.412 --> 06:54.379
just to keep the big rig
plowing forward.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.814
(truck rumbles)

06:57.184 --> 06:59.851
lisa: Ugh! This is just rough.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.822
It's rough on your body,
it's rough on your freight,

07:03.824 --> 07:05.223
it breaks your truck.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.560
(hard clanging thud)
woo!

07:08.562 --> 07:10.829
See how wide this road is?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.598
I gotta be dead center
to not go in the ditch.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.401
This thing is going
so out of control everywhere.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.907
This road is just muck and
tundra and rocks and slush.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.842
There's not much ice left.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.310
(water splashes)

07:29.383 --> 07:31.116
(hard thuds)

07:32.453 --> 07:34.453
(truck rattles)

07:36.824 --> 07:38.223
pretty much a nightmare road.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.893
I don't even think this road's
gonna last another day.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.331
(truck rumbles,
water splashes)

07:51.538 --> 07:53.305
narrator: As the sun breaks
from the clouds...

07:54.708 --> 07:57.375
(truck groans, loud crunch)
lisa: Agh! Woo!

07:57.377 --> 08:00.645
I'm gonna feel like I've been
through a war when I get there.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.648
Narrator: ...The road goes
from bad to worse.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.517
(clang)
lisa: Woo! Ow!

08:06.920 --> 08:08.320
(thudding)

08:09.690 --> 08:11.790
this is why I look older
than I am.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.827
(grunts)

08:15.829 --> 08:17.863
oh man, oh man.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.898
Ah! (bleep)!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.168
(tires spin)

08:23.170 --> 08:24.536
I gotta keep going.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.338
I can't stop
or I will be stuck.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.975
(clanging and thudding)

08:29.977 --> 08:31.843
pretty hard going.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.748
Something smells really hot.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.818
Narrator: But the temperature's
not the only thing

08:39.820 --> 08:41.720
starting to heat up.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.088
Lisa: Okay. Yeah, something
smells really hot.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.923
I don't know what it is.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.395
I see like-- oh, I see like
tons of smoke in my mirrors.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.531
(coughing)
I can't stop.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.867
See that?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.903
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh!

08:57.905 --> 09:00.305
(coughing) holy crap.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.210
Oh (bleep).

09:10.150 --> 09:12.183
Narrator: Throughout the north,

09:12.185 --> 09:15.153
the winter roads season
is entering the home stretch,

09:16.490 --> 09:18.156
so both companies are trying
to squeeze in

09:18.158 --> 09:20.725
as many loads as they can.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.795
For polar, that means sending
out rookie steph custance

09:23.797 --> 09:26.331
on her very first solo
mission...

09:26.333 --> 09:29.000
- This is the iciest,
the most dangerous

09:29.002 --> 09:30.435
I have been on yet.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.405
Narrator: In manitoba,

09:33.407 --> 09:36.474
darrell ward's trying to give
his small company a leg up

09:36.476 --> 09:39.444
by delivering three loads
in a single day.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.179
Darrell: I've got two left
to deliver.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.849
So moving out,
expanding the company.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.120
Narrator: And deep
in northern ontario...

09:50.457 --> 09:51.823
Lisa: I gotta keep going.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.358
I can't stop
or I will be stuck.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.759
(clanging and thudding)

09:54.761 --> 09:56.194
ah! (bleep)!

09:58.599 --> 10:00.432
Narrator: Darrell's business
partner lisa kelly's trying

10:00.434 --> 10:03.768
to get her haul across the
mud-filled trail to sandy lake.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.670
Lisa: Okay. Yeah, something
smells really hot.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.205
I don't know what it is.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.642
Narrator: But her plan may be
going up in smoke.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.612
- I see like-- oh, I see like
tons of smoke in my mirrors.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.180
(coughing)

10:15.182 --> 10:16.615
I can't stop.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.417
See that?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.553
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh!

10:21.555 --> 10:24.155
(coughing)
holy crap!

10:26.627 --> 10:28.126
Oh (bleep)!

10:28.128 --> 10:30.795
(coughing)
oh (bleep)!

10:30.797 --> 10:32.330
The truck's burning.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.965
There's a little bit of flames,
stuff's on fire.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.333
I don't know what it is.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.968
Fire extinguisher.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.471
(flames crackle,
smoke hisses)

10:43.010 --> 10:45.043
(fire extinguisher hisses)

10:46.413 --> 10:47.846
the, uh, tundra dried out

10:47.848 --> 10:49.981
and caught on fire
on the exhaust.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.517
(fire extinguisher hisses)

10:52.519 --> 10:54.352
narrator: Throughout the rough
journey,

10:54.354 --> 10:58.323
thawing muskeg got kicked up
and packed under lisa's hood,

10:58.325 --> 11:01.259
eventually igniting
from the heat.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.627
(steam hisses)

11:08.235 --> 11:10.301
lisa: Cool that off and
clean that out a little bit.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.674
I got my cleaning tool.
(chuckles)

11:15.676 --> 11:17.375
(snow crunches underfoot)

11:17.377 --> 11:18.843
phew!

11:18.845 --> 11:20.945
Narrator: First step,
clear out the soot and debris

11:20.947 --> 11:23.114
remaining around the exhaust.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.052
- It's really packed in there.

11:27.054 --> 11:31.156
It's all leaning right up
against this turbo.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.925
I don't see any damage
to the truck.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.927
I just caught it smoldering
before it...

11:35.929 --> 11:38.296
I don't know, it could've
melted some of these...

11:38.298 --> 11:39.731
Rubber lines.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.134
I had some great kindling,
fire starter.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.104
A bird could live
in this thing.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.908
(objects clatter lightly)

11:51.978 --> 11:54.012
I got the fire put out,

11:54.014 --> 11:55.814
cleaned the grass out
a little bit.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.018
Oh, all right.
(hood clangs shut)

12:00.020 --> 12:01.453
ungh!
(grill clanks)

12:02.856 --> 12:05.090
okay. That's that
all wrapped up.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.591
Let's hope that doesn't
happen again.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.461
(door shuts,
engine roars)

12:09.463 --> 12:10.862
narrator: The fire's out,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.565
but lisa's still not out
of the woods.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.433
- I would have hated my truck
to burn down

12:15.435 --> 12:16.801
out here in the middle
of nowhere.

12:16.803 --> 12:20.105
There'd be no one to help,
that's for sure.

12:21.475 --> 12:24.209
All right, onwards
to the next obstacle.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.813
Narrator: She's still got over
a hundred slush-filled miles
to go

12:28.815 --> 12:31.716
before she can call
the contract complete.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.386
- Really slushy right here.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.522
(slush splatters)

12:37.524 --> 12:39.023
keep her going.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.560
(truck rumbles,
chains clink)

12:42.562 --> 12:44.028
the plan now,
if I smell something,

12:44.030 --> 12:46.097
I'm gonna find a puddle
and splash through it hard.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.932
Other than that,
I'm gonna go forward

12:47.934 --> 12:49.701
and just keep driving.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.271
Narrator: While lisa's
in the thick of it,

12:53.273 --> 12:56.007
500 miles to the northwest...

12:57.844 --> 13:00.211
(truck rumbles)

13:00.213 --> 13:01.546
narrator: ...Her business
partner's already closing in

13:01.548 --> 13:03.214
on another delivery.

13:05.018 --> 13:08.086
- I got 35 kilometers
left to go

13:08.088 --> 13:10.288
to get into lac brochet.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.591
The road's still rough,
but I'll get there.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.426
I'll get this load dropped off,

13:15.428 --> 13:17.495
get turned around
and go get the third--

13:17.497 --> 13:19.564
my third leg of this adventure,

13:19.566 --> 13:21.966
finish up this journey.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.468
Narrator: Darrell ward's trying
to pull off

13:23.470 --> 13:25.503
a nearly impossible feat:

13:25.505 --> 13:28.573
Delivering three loads
in a single day

13:28.575 --> 13:32.143
to three communities stretching
well over 200 hundred miles.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.447
- I need the loads,
this company needs the loads,

13:36.449 --> 13:40.084
these communities
they need their freight

13:40.086 --> 13:43.054
and I got it on my back.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.991
Narrator: Up ahead,
it's time for the next stop.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.328
- Well, it looks like
I'm coming into lac brochet.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.799
(airbrakes hiss)

13:56.169 --> 13:58.002
- so we made it.
All right.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.372
Thank you, sir.
- My name is steve.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.907
- I'm darrell.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.477
Narrator: The pro quickly
offloads supplies

14:06.479 --> 14:08.213
for the local school...

14:12.853 --> 14:15.019
Darrell: Onto my next
destination.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.222
Narrator:...But there's no time
to rest.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.692
He's still got 50 miles to go

14:20.694 --> 14:23.895
to complete the third and
final stretch of the mission.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.099
- I know absolutely nothing
about brochet

14:28.101 --> 14:30.635
other than it's one of
the farthest north points

14:30.637 --> 14:32.837
you can drive to in manitoba.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.707
Narrator: The far north trails
are legendary

14:35.709 --> 14:37.742
for being the rockiest
and least maintained...

14:39.145 --> 14:40.812
(clanging thud)

14:40.814 --> 14:42.614
- little rough and nasty.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.852
Narrator: ...And this one's
living up to its reputation.

14:47.854 --> 14:51.155
- It's always a gamble when
you hit unfamiliar territory.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.790
You never know
until you take the load

14:52.792 --> 14:54.659
what you're gonna encounter.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.060
(clanging thud)

14:56.062 --> 14:57.495
oh (bleep)!

14:58.865 --> 15:00.365
(clanging thuds)

15:02.235 --> 15:03.701
whoa!

15:05.038 --> 15:07.005
(engine rumbles)

15:07.007 --> 15:10.608
from what I can see,
I played my cards wrong.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.344
Narrator: While darrell rocks
and rolls

15:13.346 --> 15:15.346
toward delivery number three,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.217
600 miles to the southeast...

15:21.655 --> 15:23.054
Todd: Crazy-(bleep) season.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.455
My stress level is clear up
over my--

15:24.457 --> 15:26.357
top of my head right now.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.459
Narrator: ...The competition's
got their top dog

15:28.461 --> 15:30.428
on his most challenging mission
of the year.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.531
Todd: This ain't a short run.
This is a long run.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.899
I got a big challenge
ahead of me.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.068
I got a big job ahead of me
to get this load in.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.503
(engine hums)

15:40.874 --> 15:42.707
narrator: Todd dewey's headed
to the remote community
of big trout,

15:42.709 --> 15:48.046
a 500 mile road that's been
closed all season until now.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.183
Todd: I've gotta get
this load in,

15:52.185 --> 15:53.985
get it to delivered
to those communities

15:53.987 --> 15:55.553
and get the hell out of here.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.989
Narrator: The town's desperate
for the 20-ton load

15:57.991 --> 15:59.457
of building materials

15:59.459 --> 16:03.261
needed for a giant
construction project.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.662
- It sucks and
it's a lot of stress,

16:04.664 --> 16:06.464
and it's not just five minutes
of it.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.399
You're talking (bleep)
15 hours

16:08.401 --> 16:10.435
of nothing but stressful
(bleep) driving.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.139
And on top of all of that
it's my birthday.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.845
I have a family at home,
a wife and kids,

16:20.847 --> 16:23.848
that I miss with all my heart
every day I'm up here.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.852
I know what the feeling is
to come home with a pay check

16:27.854 --> 16:30.922
or be able to, you know,
give my kids what they need.

16:30.924 --> 16:33.424
So imagine what it's like
for these communities up here

16:33.426 --> 16:35.793
when we come rolling in
with all their supplies.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.629
Pretty awesome feeling,

16:38.631 --> 16:41.399
and that's why I continue
to do it year after year.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.203
(truck rumbles)

16:48.008 --> 16:49.440
there's a road coming off
to the side right here.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.242
This might be the one
right here.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.977
Here we go, baby.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.546
Narrator: As todd reaches
the turn off to big trout...

16:56.916 --> 16:58.349
- What in the hell?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.053
Narrator: ...He's hit with
an unwelcome surprise.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.288
- This road is closed.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.757
(gearshift squeaks)

17:05.759 --> 17:08.092
that sucks.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.002
Narrator: On the road
to big trout lake...

17:18.004 --> 17:20.271
(engine rumbles loudly)

17:20.273 --> 17:22.440
- there's a road coming off
to the side right here.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.175
This might be the one
right here.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.743
Here we go, baby.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.712
Narrator: ...Todd dewey's
birthday...

17:27.714 --> 17:29.147
- What in the hell?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.550
Narrator: ...Is turning into
a nightmare.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.519
- This road is closed.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.321
That sucks.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.091
Narrator: The road
that just opened

17:40.093 --> 17:42.760
for the first time this morning

17:42.762 --> 17:44.796
is already getting shut down.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.598
Todd: This is gonna be one hell
of a (bleep) show.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.233
I have a bad feeling.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.374
- The road's closed, uh?
- Yeah.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.443
- Just too warm
of temperatures, uh?

18:00.113 --> 18:03.147
- Ohhh... All right, buddy.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.418
So he's the, uh, head road guy

18:07.420 --> 18:08.853
for this road
going into big trout.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.254
He's kind of the boss.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.823
I was gonna hit the road
with everything I had

18:11.825 --> 18:15.059
and he just informed me
that this road is closed.

18:15.061 --> 18:18.229
There's nobody coming in
and there's no one going out.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.198
Narrator: All todd can do
is wait

18:21.568 --> 18:23.067
and hope temperatures cool down
enough

18:23.069 --> 18:25.303
that the trail's reopened.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.705
- We don't got no time to waste.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.107
And when you get up there

18:29.109 --> 18:30.508
and you can't get onto the road

18:30.510 --> 18:31.976
'cause it ain't cold enough,

18:31.978 --> 18:33.911
there's nothing more
frustrating than that.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.647
Narrator: If the road remains
shut down

18:36.649 --> 18:38.516
and the load goes undelivered,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.185
the community would take
a financial hit

18:41.187 --> 18:43.254
that could be crippling.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.655
- I don't think I'm gonna be
able to move anywhere

18:44.657 --> 18:46.157
or do anything, so...

18:48.294 --> 18:50.795
That's not a good situation.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.397
It's turning out to be
an absolute (bleep) disaster
of a trip.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.667
Narrator: While polar's yet
to deliver

18:56.669 --> 18:59.103
a single load on the day,

19:00.773 --> 19:02.640
a hundred miles to the north...

19:02.642 --> 19:06.043
(engine roars,
mud splatters)

19:09.082 --> 19:12.250
- you don't normally go for a
Sunday drive through the woods.

19:12.252 --> 19:16.020
Narrator: ...The competition's
already chalking up
their third.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.891
- I'm just getting into
sandy lake now.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.292
All right, I'm here.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.694
I just gotta wait for someone
to offload me now.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.197
Narrator: Lisa kelly
secures a huge payday...

19:27.700 --> 19:29.967
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.904
- So how was the road?
- Um, falling apart.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.906
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.208
Narrator: Scoring big
for the small company

19:37.210 --> 19:39.443
and for the community
of sandy lake.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.947
- When it's all said and done,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.783
the communities having their
supplies is what really counts.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.151
It is actually a concern

19:47.153 --> 19:48.586
that we get these loads
to these people

19:48.588 --> 19:50.521
because it just might not be
a big enough window.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.356
This year more so than ever.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.493
- Well, thank you
for bringing our supplies.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.128
- Yeah, you're welcome.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.800
Narrator: While the veteran
locks in the big contract,

20:04.804 --> 20:08.606
100 miles to the south,
on the trail to pikangikum...

20:11.010 --> 20:12.443
(chains clink)

20:16.015 --> 20:18.916
steph: Going out on my first
run solo.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.885
Narrator: Polar's rookie,
steph custance,

20:20.887 --> 20:23.054
is trying to pull off
an ice roads mission

20:23.056 --> 20:25.289
all on her own.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.824
Steph: Being out on my own
on this road,

20:28.428 --> 20:30.528
it's a lot more nerve wracking
than uh,

20:30.530 --> 20:31.996
than I imagined.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.535
This is a very washboard bumpy

20:37.537 --> 20:38.936
uh-uh-uh-uh,

20:38.938 --> 20:40.538
dodgy road.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.106
(rattling)

20:44.410 --> 20:46.143
she's icy.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.812
There's lots of curves
and winds.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.256
I brought my sons school picture

20:58.258 --> 20:59.690
on the winter roads for me.

20:59.692 --> 21:03.794
I uh, I didn't have it last
trip which I regret,

21:03.796 --> 21:07.198
but it's a good reminder on
what I have to get home for,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.933
what's keeping my-my
drive going,

21:08.935 --> 21:10.668
what's making me out here
doing this.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.436
(engine hums)

21:12.438 --> 21:13.904
(truck rattles)

21:15.275 --> 21:17.908
remind me why I'm out here
on these awful roads.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.612
Narrator: Just ahead...

21:26.052 --> 21:27.451
Narrator: ...The new ice road
trucker

21:27.453 --> 21:30.254
is about to face her
ultimate test.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.889
Steph: Uh, makes me really
nervous

21:31.891 --> 21:35.426
'cause I know for a fact
I'm pretty much max weight.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.296
(creaking)

21:38.298 --> 21:40.898
and then we got snow,
it's snowing on top of it.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.367
And with the snow, snow acts
as an insulation on the ice

21:43.369 --> 21:45.169
so it, it doesn't get the cold
wind,

21:45.171 --> 21:47.705
it doesn't get the, you know,
that wind chill

21:47.707 --> 21:50.074
and then and that weather
with it like the snow

21:50.076 --> 21:54.111
just acts almost like a blanket
for, for the ice.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.549
It's gonna be the most
dangerous one period as is.
