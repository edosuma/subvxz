JT?

00:04.679 --> 00:06.547
How bad is it, Cat?
He's not gonna die, is he?

00:06.648 --> 00:07.748
Code Blue! Code Blue!

00:07.849 --> 00:09.550
Hey, guys. What's up?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.618
I thought I lost you.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.851
Not a chance.

00:11.852 --> 00:13.420
We're the people that just saved
your friend's life.

00:13.520 --> 00:14.753
How and why?

00:14.854 --> 00:16.687
That's all you get to know
unless you agree to help us.

00:16.789 --> 00:17.485
Help you do what?

00:17.509 --> 00:19.533
In a world where science
can create beasts,

00:19.625 --> 00:21.359
you shouldn't be surprised to learn that
there's a lot worse things

00:21.460 --> 00:24.095
out there. And now that we know
what you can do and who you are,

00:24.196 --> 00:26.398
we're gonna need your help to figure
out exactly what we're up against.

00:26.498 --> 00:28.733
What do you want to do
about Agent Thomas' offer?

00:28.834 --> 00:31.369
I don't want to think
about it. I just

00:31.470 --> 00:33.404
want to be here
with you right now.

00:33.505 --> 00:34.505

Oh.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.215
What's this?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.556
It's a stethoscope. Did you...
did you miss that chapter?

03:04.585 --> 03:08.154
It's-it's a gift.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.190
To remind you not
to use your beast senses

03:10.291 --> 03:12.525
to check heartbeats.
Ah.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.561
Better not to be outed
on your first day back to work,

03:14.661 --> 03:17.930
Dr. Keller.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.528
God, that sounds weird,
doesn't it? Dr. Keller?

03:20.529 --> 03:23.403
No. It sounds perfect.
It sounds normal.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.771
You worked really hard
to get reinstated.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.874
You deserve to have your life
back after being sidetracked.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.243
We deserve it.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.679
It's almost too good to be true.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.181
I keep waiting for
the other shoe to drop.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.682
Come on. It's been

03:37.783 --> 03:39.951
over two months since Gabe.
I know.

03:40.052 --> 03:42.554
You're still worried about what
those agents said, aren't you?

03:42.655 --> 03:44.389
About there being worse threats.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.890
No.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.759
I don't know. Maybe.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.195
Catherine, come on,
if what they said was true,

03:50.296 --> 03:52.063
we would've known
about it by now, right?

03:52.164 --> 03:55.366
Besides, we've sacrificed
enough, okay? We don't

03:55.467 --> 03:57.535
have to sacrifice anything more.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.971
We got each other,
we got our future.

04:00.072 --> 04:02.741
A normal future,
okay? And I do not

04:02.842 --> 04:04.375
want to risk losing that
ever again.

04:04.476 --> 04:06.410
Neither do I.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.746
I love this, Vincent.
I love our life together.

04:08.847 --> 04:11.482
Okay. Well, then stop worrying
that something's gonna come along

04:11.583 --> 04:13.551
and mess it up, okay?
We won't let it.

04:13.652 --> 04:15.753
I-I will definitely not let it.

04:15.854 --> 04:18.289
Mwah. Okay, now, don't forget,

04:18.390 --> 04:21.625
9:00. Ciel Magnifique.
We got a lot to celebrate.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.394
I'll go there right
from the precinct.

04:23.495 --> 04:25.529
Oh, and tell JT
that I'm thinking about him!

04:36.440 --> 04:39.342
Sorry.

04:47.385 --> 04:50.287
Welcome back, Professor.

04:50.388 --> 04:53.623
Thank you. Uh...

04:53.724 --> 04:56.560
uh, it's, uh...

05:00.064 --> 05:03.532
...it's-it's good to be back.

05:16.646 --> 05:19.515
Sorry.

05:22.652 --> 05:25.554
It was your first day back.
Of course you were nervous.

05:25.655 --> 05:27.122
JT, Gabe's attack

05:27.224 --> 05:28.944
was incredibly traumatic
for you, all right?

05:28.991 --> 05:30.826
It's only been a couple
of months.

05:30.927 --> 05:32.861
You have to be patient with yourself.
You have got to stop calling me.

05:32.962 --> 05:36.464
But, still, even the doctors say you need
to start getting your strength back...

05:36.565 --> 05:37.972
I told you before, I don't want
to get involved unless you have

05:37.996 --> 05:38.800
...and your life back.

05:38.801 --> 05:40.802
something specific to show me.
Who is that?

05:40.903 --> 05:42.838
Agent Thomas.
All right. Okay. All right, all right.

05:42.939 --> 05:45.807
Maybe you're not ready
for teaching. How about lunch?

05:45.908 --> 05:47.181
That's what you said last time
I came down, but you didn't have squat.

05:47.205 --> 05:48.476
It'll be good for you.

05:48.477 --> 05:49.477
It'll be good for us.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.678
No, no, you can't keep trying
to guilt me into this

05:50.679 --> 05:52.714
just because you saved JT. No.
Attaboy. All right, Il Cantuccio.

05:52.814 --> 05:54.614
I'll decide if
and when Vincent needs to know.

05:54.650 --> 05:55.883
You keep him out of this.

05:59.121 --> 06:00.388
How's JT?

06:00.489 --> 06:03.490
Better than he thinks he is.

06:03.591 --> 06:07.828
I'm doing everything I can to
help him, but there's a limit.

06:07.929 --> 06:08.863
You know, I'm not good
with neurotic.

06:08.964 --> 06:10.330
I don't have the patience.

06:10.431 --> 06:11.431
Still,

06:11.432 --> 06:12.833
he almost died.

06:12.934 --> 06:15.402
I know that. But he didn't.

06:15.503 --> 06:16.871
You know,
he lost

06:16.972 --> 06:18.705
a lot of blood,
he got really weak,

06:18.807 --> 06:21.007
but he should be better by now.

06:21.108 --> 06:22.509
There's something holding him
back. I just don't know

06:22.610 --> 06:24.010
what it is. And...

06:24.111 --> 06:25.779
it'd be nice
to get my life back, too.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.946
Trust me,

06:27.047 --> 06:28.047
it's worth the wait.

06:28.115 --> 06:29.015
Excuse me. Where are you going?

06:29.116 --> 06:30.183
Don't we have
a case?

06:30.285 --> 06:32.185
Yeah, but those DHS agents

06:32.287 --> 06:33.588
think they actually
might have something.

06:33.589 --> 06:34.721
All right, you know what,

06:34.722 --> 06:36.956
you keep saying you don't want
to get involved,

06:37.057 --> 06:38.491
yet you keep getting involved.

06:39.794 --> 06:41.360
You almost act like you, uh,

06:41.461 --> 06:42.862
miss fighting beasts sometimes.

06:42.963 --> 06:44.030
That's ridiculous.

06:44.131 --> 06:46.565
Oh?
Okay.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.601
Maybe I do. A little.

06:48.702 --> 06:51.604
I mean, it's not like I miss the
danger or-or how much of my life

06:51.705 --> 06:53.773
I had to give up for the
last two years, but...

06:53.873 --> 06:55.541
on the other
hand, I...

06:55.642 --> 06:58.444
I do sort of miss being part
of something, I don't know,

06:58.545 --> 07:00.446
bigger, important.

07:00.547 --> 07:02.381
I guess that's harder
to let go of than I thought.

07:02.482 --> 07:05.484
Well, it's not harder
for Vincent. He'll hit the roof

07:05.585 --> 07:08.145
if he finds out you're cheating on him.
I am not cheating on him.

07:08.221 --> 07:11.389
You know what I mean.
Believe me, the last thing I want to do

07:11.490 --> 07:13.058
is risk what we have

07:13.159 --> 07:15.260
or, worse, risk
Vincent's life.

07:16.996 --> 07:20.098
But I can't escape
this feeling that...

07:20.200 --> 07:22.500
we're still meant
to do something bigger,

07:22.601 --> 07:25.537
that-that maybe I'm supposed to
be a part of something bigger.

07:31.544 --> 07:33.445
<i>Where's Keller?</i>

07:33.546 --> 07:35.279
Same answer
as before. I'm not

07:35.381 --> 07:37.415
bothering him with this
unless there's a reason to.

07:37.516 --> 07:39.617
She just wants to see what we've
got before they get involved.

07:39.719 --> 07:41.353
If we decide
to get involved.

07:41.454 --> 07:43.254
Lady, you're
already involved.

07:43.355 --> 07:45.289
You think we saved your friend's
ass because we're nice?

07:45.390 --> 07:46.950
You owe us.
Whatever you did to save JT,

07:46.959 --> 07:49.160
you did before
you asked us to help you.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.162
And Vincent and I, we only
agreed to think about it.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.629
People are dying, Detective,

07:52.731 --> 07:54.498
innocent people,
all over the city.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.399
And someone or something's
responsible for it.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.935
And you want to think about it?

07:58.036 --> 08:00.003
Yes, I do. Because I've been
down this road before

08:00.104 --> 08:01.839
with the Feds, and it hasn't
always ended pretty.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.440
We've paid
our dues.

08:03.541 --> 08:06.276
We've risked our lives enough,
especially Vincent.

08:06.378 --> 08:08.512
We've risked something,
too, Detective,

08:08.613 --> 08:10.781
our jobs,
our reputation.

08:10.882 --> 08:12.983
The only person who knows about
this is the deputy secretary,

08:13.084 --> 08:14.985
and he's only allowing us
to keep doing this

08:15.086 --> 08:17.487
as long as no one on the inside
or outside these walls

08:17.588 --> 08:19.655
finds out
about it.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.524
Check this out.

08:24.328 --> 08:26.662
Amsterdam, 145th Street.

08:26.764 --> 08:29.632
Construction worker gets
into a fight, falls ten floors,

08:29.733 --> 08:32.635
but somehow only breaks his arm.
Morningside, a pissed-off driver

08:32.736 --> 08:35.371
rolls a car with his bare hands.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.807
Rikers, a prisoner
goes crazy,

08:37.908 --> 08:39.674
kicks open a fortified cell door

08:39.777 --> 08:41.342
and beats two guards to death.
Okay,

08:41.445 --> 08:43.845
this could be anything. This
could be the latest street drug.

08:43.847 --> 08:45.347
This is no street
drug, Chandler.

08:45.449 --> 08:47.349
You've seen enough with
your beast buddy to know that.

08:47.451 --> 08:50.519
Somehow, somebody's getting
ordinary people, innocents,

08:50.620 --> 08:53.488
to do extraordinary things, things
that nobody should be able to do.

08:53.589 --> 08:56.258
Experimenting on them, turning
them into guinea pigs, pushing

08:56.359 --> 08:57.927
the limits of their body
and mind.

08:58.028 --> 09:01.363
And who's behind it and why,
we don't know.

09:01.464 --> 09:04.225
But what we do know is that
this pattern is increasing. It's happening

09:04.301 --> 09:06.517
more often. More and more
people are being targeted.

09:06.518 --> 09:09.806
And they're hurting other people
or dying because of it.

09:11.206 --> 09:13.241
I don't know
what you want me to say.

09:13.342 --> 09:15.477
Say you'll help.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.347
Say Vincent will help

09:19.449 --> 09:21.349
because we're gonna
need him to stop this.

09:21.450 --> 09:25.686
I need more. I need proof
before I take this to him.

09:25.787 --> 09:27.021
Because I'm the only person
in this room

09:27.122 --> 09:29.490
who cares about saving his life.

09:40.802 --> 09:42.703
Hey.

09:42.804 --> 09:43.904
Hey.

09:45.406 --> 09:47.741
What are you doing here,
McBeastie?

09:47.843 --> 09:50.277
Aren't you supposed to be, like,
playing doctor or something?

09:50.378 --> 09:53.146
Yeah. I don't want to be late
on my first day. So...

09:53.247 --> 09:55.415
remember that box of things
I asked you to hold onto for me

09:55.516 --> 09:56.950
before I left for Afghanistan?

09:57.051 --> 09:58.986
Your mom's stuff? Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

09:59.087 --> 10:00.087
C-Can I see it?

10:00.154 --> 10:01.654
Of course. Uh...

10:01.755 --> 10:04.157
if I can remember
where I put it.

10:04.258 --> 10:07.727
Come on.
You still need that thing?

10:07.828 --> 10:09.729
What, the cane? Yeah.

10:09.830 --> 10:11.664
You don't want me to fall down

10:11.765 --> 10:14.901
and break my neck, right?
Uh-huh.

10:15.002 --> 10:18.004
So how did your first day back
at class go?

10:22.510 --> 10:24.443
Oh. Here it is.

10:26.113 --> 10:27.279
Here you go.

10:27.381 --> 10:29.215
That's it, right?
Yeah.

10:35.422 --> 10:38.324
What are you
looking for?

10:39.426 --> 10:41.793
Mom's engagement ring.

10:45.398 --> 10:48.466
I am gonna ask Catherine
to marry me.

Well, you should be--
especially after everything

11:22.983 --> 11:24.418
you and Vincent have been through.
Calm down.

11:24.519 --> 11:26.686
We're just getting
used to being normal.

11:26.788 --> 11:29.688
Don't push it.
Oh, Heather, you look beautiful.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.609
Do you like it?

11:30.633 --> 11:32.125
Yeah, I like it even better
than the last one.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.846
Oh, the last one
I just tried on, or the one

11:33.928 --> 11:35.608
I wore when I found out
Vincent was a beast

11:35.662 --> 11:36.782
and nearly got blown up?
Hey.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.398
Shh. Just because

11:38.498 --> 11:40.533
you know now doesn't mean
everyone needs to know.

11:40.634 --> 11:42.902
Oh, right. Sorry.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.570
I guess I'm still
getting used to this.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.772
But I'm glad I know now, Cat.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.874
I mean, it might still creep
me out, like, a little bit.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.777
But at least you don't have to keep it
a secret from me anymore.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.345
Well, I'm glad
you know, too.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.548
But you do have to
keep it a secret,

11:55.649 --> 11:57.583
even from your fiancé--
you know that, right?

11:57.684 --> 11:59.952
Yeah. No, I know.
Okay.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.920
But, I mean,
at some point in time,

12:02.021 --> 12:03.755
I'll eventually
have to tell him.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.758
Otherwise, I'm lying to him, right?
I can't wait for you

12:06.859 --> 12:09.194
to finally meet him.
As long as he treats you right,

12:09.295 --> 12:10.795
that's all that matters.
And if he doesn't,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.630
I can always just sic
your boyfriend on him.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.451
Heather!
What? That's not a sisterly perk?

12:21.540 --> 12:22.607
Everything okay?

12:22.708 --> 12:24.108
Yeah.

12:24.209 --> 12:25.743
It's just this case
I'm working on.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.211
I might have a lead.

12:27.312 --> 12:29.447
Can you find your way
back to the hotel?

12:29.548 --> 12:31.082
Sure.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.984
That's fine.
Thank you.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.452
I will call you.

12:34.552 --> 12:36.988
And for the record, he
is my perk, not yours.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.100
Hey, get Dr. Martin
on that head wound

12:50.201 --> 12:52.569
in E.R. 4; call Ortho,
tell 'em we're sending them

12:52.670 --> 12:54.104
a compound fracture;
and have Shannon prep triage--

12:54.205 --> 12:55.472
we got inbound
multiples.

12:55.573 --> 12:56.907
Uh, excuse me.
Yo,

12:57.008 --> 12:58.368
are you ob-gyn?
No. No, you're not.

12:58.442 --> 12:59.442
You're in E.R. 3.

12:59.443 --> 13:01.277
Jackson is 5.
Come on, people.

13:01.379 --> 13:02.513
Excuse me. Hi. Hi.

13:02.614 --> 13:03.847
I'm-I'm Dr. Keller.

13:03.948 --> 13:05.849
I believe I'm the
new E.R. doctor.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.750
I'm supposed to report here.
Oh, right. I heard something about that.

13:07.851 --> 13:09.819
Yeah.
Wait.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.201
Aren't you the war hero
everybody was after, the fugitive?

13:12.256 --> 13:13.956
I, uh, I was
exonerated.

13:14.058 --> 13:15.658
Someone was trying
to frame me.

13:15.759 --> 13:17.427
Welcome to New York Gen.

13:17.528 --> 13:19.528
You're gonna work your ass off here--
it's nonstop.

13:19.563 --> 13:20.863
We got an incoming
construction accident.

13:20.964 --> 13:21.998
Scaffolding fell or something.

13:22.099 --> 13:23.666
So just dive right in.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.100
Okay.
Discharge 'em or admit 'em, people.

13:25.201 --> 13:26.702
We need the beds.

13:26.803 --> 13:28.638
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Uh, do shifts

13:28.739 --> 13:31.040
usually finish
on time here?

13:31.141 --> 13:33.676
Well, I-I got dinner
with my, my girl tonight.

13:33.777 --> 13:36.445
I'm finally... finally gonna
ask her to marry me, so...

13:36.547 --> 13:37.813
Don't do it, hero.

13:37.915 --> 13:39.714
Nobody stays married
around here for long.

13:39.815 --> 13:41.050
By the way,

13:41.151 --> 13:44.086
nice stethoscope--
it's very shiny.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.127
♪ Summering in

13:52.228 --> 13:55.897
♪ The Catskills, baby...

13:55.998 --> 13:57.398
Hey.

13:57.499 --> 13:59.067
Hey.
No, no, it's all right,

13:59.168 --> 14:00.835
it's all right,
don't get up.

14:00.937 --> 14:03.071
You okay here?

14:03.172 --> 14:04.539
Me? Yeah.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.407
Sure. Fine.
Great.

14:06.508 --> 14:08.309
Yep.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.144
It's all good.

14:10.245 --> 14:12.680
Breathe, JT.

14:12.781 --> 14:14.982
Baby steps, remember?

14:15.084 --> 14:18.419
I know. It's just... hard.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.820
I... I mean, let's face it,

14:19.921 --> 14:21.389
I shouldn't even be here.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.296
Yeah, but you got to start
getting out sometime.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.425
No.

14:24.426 --> 14:26.494
I mean here as in alive, at all.

14:26.595 --> 14:28.329
JT, don't start.
Tess, I've gone over

14:28.430 --> 14:29.710
my medical records
a dozen times,

14:29.798 --> 14:31.231
I'm telling you,
there's no way

14:31.332 --> 14:33.533
I should have survived that,
I should be dead.

14:33.635 --> 14:34.501
But you're not dead.

14:34.603 --> 14:36.036
But only 'cause of

14:36.137 --> 14:37.905
whatever crazy medicine
those DHS agents gave me,

14:38.006 --> 14:39.339
and I still can't
figure it out.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.240
And you're spinning again.

14:40.341 --> 14:41.441
Well, what if I'm right?

14:41.542 --> 14:42.776
What if I'm not really supposed
to be here?

14:42.877 --> 14:43.877
What am I
supposed to do?

14:43.945 --> 14:45.345
You know what you're
supposed to do?

14:45.446 --> 14:47.247
You're supposed to get off your
damn pity pot and grow a pair.

14:47.348 --> 14:50.217
Look, a terrible thing
happened to you, all right?

14:50.318 --> 14:51.918
You almost died,
that sucks.

14:52.019 --> 14:54.354
But you didn't,
you're alive.

14:54.455 --> 14:56.289
It's a blessing, and you
just want to waste it

14:56.390 --> 14:58.525
by looking over your shoulder
for the Grim Freakin' Reaper.

14:58.626 --> 14:59.726
Tess, people
are watching.

14:59.827 --> 15:01.361
I don't care, JT.
I've had it.

15:01.462 --> 15:03.195
Look, I care
about you,

15:03.296 --> 15:06.398
and I've been taking care
of you, but no more.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.101
You have to get over this.

15:08.201 --> 15:09.769
You have to figure it out,
all right?

15:09.870 --> 15:12.538
Because God doesn't make
mistakes, you're here.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.708
So, figure out
the hell why, already.

15:19.412 --> 15:21.113
Ugh.

15:34.894 --> 15:36.795
<i>Nobody beats Tyler.</i>

15:36.896 --> 15:37.896
At anything.

15:37.997 --> 15:39.397
He's not the
fastest rising

15:39.498 --> 15:41.133
stock analyst on the
Street for nothing.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.068
It's how we got all of this.

15:43.169 --> 15:44.936
But you said he changed.

15:45.038 --> 15:46.038
How?

15:46.039 --> 15:48.640
I don't know.

15:48.741 --> 15:51.643
He just suddenly became more...

15:51.743 --> 15:53.144
aggressive.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.912
More ambitious.

15:55.013 --> 15:56.314
Like, overnight.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.250
I mean, he was
always driven.

15:59.351 --> 16:00.851
He always wanted to do

16:00.952 --> 16:03.087
whatever it took to get
to the top, but...

16:03.189 --> 16:04.189
But what?

16:04.256 --> 16:05.856
It's like he became

16:05.957 --> 16:07.325
a different person
all of a sudden.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.326
Somebody I didn't even
recognize anymore.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.662
First, he started
working nonstop.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.165
And then he started fighting.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.201
With anybody and everybody
that got in his way.

16:17.302 --> 16:18.602
Then he got arrested,

16:18.704 --> 16:20.544
threatening to blow up
his own office building.

16:20.638 --> 16:22.606
He knocked out two guards
and broke out of jail.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.841
How could he do that?

16:24.942 --> 16:27.844
I don't... I don't understand.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.479
That's not Tyler.

16:29.581 --> 16:31.515
What is happening to him?

16:36.921 --> 16:39.122
We've been scouring the city,
looking for an innocent

16:39.224 --> 16:40.990
that fits the MO
before they end up dead,

16:41.092 --> 16:42.859
and now we've got one.
It's a sad story,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.861
and I feel bad for her,
but it's New York.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.462
There are any number

16:46.563 --> 16:48.563
of stressed out workaholics
losing it in this town.

16:48.565 --> 16:50.233
They're not losing it
like this guy is losing it.

16:50.334 --> 16:52.001
Want to know how
he got out of jail?

16:52.103 --> 16:53.369
Yeah, he knocked
out two guards.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.537
He jumped 60 feet,
from one rooftop

16:54.638 --> 16:55.705
to the other,
and then got away.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.406
60 feet, Detective.

16:57.507 --> 17:00.343
Which means what Tyler Zane
did was impossible.

17:00.444 --> 17:01.873
Do you get it?

17:01.897 --> 17:03.346
Somehow,
somebody did this to Tyler.

17:03.347 --> 17:05.180
Just like they did it
to those other people

17:05.281 --> 17:06.549
that we showed
you before.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.251
You said that you would help
if we found proof.

17:08.352 --> 17:10.185
Well, help us find Tyler.

17:10.287 --> 17:12.186
Help us find who's behind this
so that nobody else gets hurt.

17:12.289 --> 17:14.021
And get your boyfriend's ass
out here to help, too.

17:14.124 --> 17:16.258
Because God only knows
what we're up against.

17:19.162 --> 17:21.096
Tyler!

17:34.644 --> 17:37.111
She's not here yet, is she?

17:37.212 --> 17:38.412
No, no, don't worry.

17:38.481 --> 17:39.881
You're early,
and she'll be late.

17:39.982 --> 17:40.982
Oh, traffic.

17:40.983 --> 17:42.083
Women.

17:42.184 --> 17:44.085
Voilà, your table.

17:44.186 --> 17:45.587
Dozen red roses,
candles, champagne.

17:45.688 --> 17:46.921
Perfect.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.923
Would you like to order
appetizers, or wait?

17:49.024 --> 17:50.792
Uh... No, no, I-I'll wait.

17:50.893 --> 17:52.393
Very good.
Oh, one more thing.

17:52.494 --> 17:53.961
Do you know how I would, uh,

17:54.062 --> 17:56.063
place the ring
in her champagne glass,

17:56.165 --> 17:57.445
just so, you know,
she doesn't...

17:57.465 --> 17:59.366
well, swallow
the thing before...

17:59.467 --> 18:01.602
Place it in a strawberry,
then pour.

18:01.703 --> 18:03.537
That way, the ring
will float to the top...

18:03.638 --> 18:05.138
I'm sorry,
please hold that thought.

18:06.974 --> 18:08.609
Damn it.

18:08.710 --> 18:11.578
Uh, is there any chance you
could hold the table for me?

18:11.680 --> 18:13.947
I got to get back to the hospital.
Of course.

18:14.048 --> 18:16.082
Thank you, much appreciated.

18:16.184 --> 18:18.752
I will be back
as soon as I can.

18:21.488 --> 18:23.256
Hey, babe, I was just
about to call you.

18:23.357 --> 18:24.724
Can we push dinner
just a little?

18:24.826 --> 18:26.392
I got to go back
for some emergency.

18:26.493 --> 18:28.394
I know.

18:28.495 --> 18:30.197
I think I'm the emergency.

18:36.856 --> 18:38.924
You recognize the assailant, Detective?
No.

18:39.025 --> 18:40.702
You see which direction
he went after the attack?

18:40.726 --> 18:42.006
No.

18:42.284 --> 18:44.485
Vincent, I am so sorry.

18:44.686 --> 18:45.886
You okay?

18:45.987 --> 18:47.421
Yeah, I'm fine,
just a little sore.

18:47.522 --> 18:49.122
Look, uh, I'm Dr. Keller,

18:49.223 --> 18:50.958
I'm one of the doctors here.

18:51.059 --> 18:52.759
Do you mind holding off on
the questions for a few minutes?

18:52.860 --> 18:53.860
Sure, no problem.

18:53.962 --> 18:55.729
You're lucky.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.632
Could have been
a lot worse.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.400
Is that Agent Thomas?

19:00.501 --> 19:02.535
Yeah.
Okay, Catherine,

19:02.637 --> 19:04.071
what is going on? What
are you doing with him?

19:04.171 --> 19:06.706
I wasn't planning
on doing anything with him.

19:06.807 --> 19:09.242
But I just... ow.

19:09.343 --> 19:10.710
All right, let me take a look.

19:10.811 --> 19:11.811
Where does it hurt?

19:11.912 --> 19:14.280
Just the back
of my neck.

19:14.381 --> 19:16.048
They've been calling
ever since they saved JT.

19:16.150 --> 19:17.717
I didn't want to
bother you with it,

19:17.818 --> 19:20.052
I didn't want to
upset our lives.

19:20.154 --> 19:22.254
Well, it's a little too late
for that now, isn't it?

19:22.355 --> 19:24.323
Where's Barnett?

19:26.727 --> 19:27.827
He's dead.

19:29.863 --> 19:30.897
What?

19:30.898 --> 19:33.933
We were attacked by
I don't know what.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.037
It was fast.

19:40.906 --> 19:42.141
It was violent.

19:44.377 --> 19:46.145
It was unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

19:46.246 --> 19:47.779
<i>Unlike anything</i> we've <i>ever</i>
<i>seen before.</i>

19:50.950 --> 19:52.451
Catherine, why didn't you talk
to me about this?

19:52.552 --> 19:54.285
You know, for a lot of reasons,
the least of which--

19:54.386 --> 19:55.654
you can't handle this stuff
on your own.

19:55.755 --> 19:57.155
You could have got
yourself killed.

19:57.256 --> 19:58.976
I know, and I only
didn't bother you with it

19:59.025 --> 20:00.358
because I-I wanted
to protect you.

20:00.459 --> 20:02.360
I didn't expect...

20:02.461 --> 20:04.129
Coding, he's coding.

20:04.229 --> 20:05.130
Who's the on-call
cardiologist?

20:05.230 --> 20:06.665
Don't move, okay?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.868
Page neurovascular. I need
a cardiologist in here, stat.

20:10.969 --> 20:13.003
Where's RT? I need an RT here
five minutes ago.

20:13.104 --> 20:15.640
What do we know, Ian?
Multiple sharp force entries.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.476
We got them all, but he's still
tachy, and he's hemorrhaging,

20:18.577 --> 20:20.645
and I can't figure out why.
All right, get the paddles ready.

20:20.745 --> 20:23.181
Administer 10cc's
of Lidocaine immediately.

20:23.282 --> 20:25.949
And then I need
everybody quiet, okay?

20:26.051 --> 20:27.718
Pushing Lidocaine.

20:48.906 --> 20:50.666
Okay, we've got
an ascending aortic puncture.

20:50.741 --> 20:52.676
His heart must've gotten
nicked somehow.

20:52.776 --> 20:54.644
Get up to O.R., stat.
Call cardio, tell them

20:54.745 --> 20:56.646
to prep for valvuloplasty,
let's go, come on.

20:56.747 --> 20:58.481
Go.
Move it. Come on. Get him there fast.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.450
How the hell did he know that?

21:10.293 --> 21:11.928
Someone is experimenting
on innocents,

21:12.029 --> 21:14.731
making them do things that
they shouldn't be able to do.

21:14.832 --> 21:16.199
No. Sounds familiar.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.066
Exactly, except
in this guy's case,

21:18.167 --> 21:20.936
they've been able to somehow
amplify his ambitious nature,

21:21.037 --> 21:23.171
and turn him into an
adrenaline-charged psychopath,

21:23.273 --> 21:25.841
willing to destroy anyone or
anything that gets in his way.

21:25.942 --> 21:27.509
You thought you could
handle that all on your own?

21:27.611 --> 21:29.077
I went to help
interview Zane's wife,

21:29.178 --> 21:30.879
see if there was something
that we needed to worry about.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.181
Yeah, well, congratulations,
Cat, 'cause there's a hell

21:33.282 --> 21:35.583
of a lot to worry
about now, isn't there?

21:35.684 --> 21:37.052
I know you're upset.
Yeah, damn right, I'm upset.

21:37.153 --> 21:38.453
I thought we
talked about this,

21:38.554 --> 21:40.355
I thought we agreed

21:40.456 --> 21:42.557
that we wouldn't risk losing
everything that we already have.

21:42.658 --> 21:45.627
This doesn't have to.
The hell it doesn't, okay?

21:45.728 --> 21:48.096
We were supposed to celebrate
tonight-- just you and me--

21:48.197 --> 21:50.531
not get dragged back
into all this crap again.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.532
I am sorry about tonight, I am.

21:52.634 --> 21:54.969
And I know how much it was...
No, you got no idea.

21:56.404 --> 21:57.905
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

21:58.006 --> 21:59.974
I'm upset,
it's a lot to process. I just...

22:00.075 --> 22:02.376
You know, I thought
we were past all this.

22:02.477 --> 22:04.211
Listen to me.

22:04.312 --> 22:07.281
The last thing I want to do is
put us at risk, you know that.

22:07.382 --> 22:12.085
I love what we have,
I love what our future holds,

22:12.186 --> 22:13.720
but there has got to be a reason

22:13.821 --> 22:15.121
why this keeps
coming back to us,

22:15.222 --> 22:16.623
whether we like it or not.

22:16.724 --> 22:18.458
If we've learned anything,

22:18.559 --> 22:20.761
it's that we are a part
of something bigger,

22:20.861 --> 22:23.630
you and me, just like Alistair
and Rebecca before us.

22:23.731 --> 22:25.631
Can you really just
walk away from that?

22:25.732 --> 22:27.600
Look, Catherine, we
have been through hell

22:27.701 --> 22:30.303
and back again for,
what, over two years now.

22:30.404 --> 22:32.305
How long are we supposed
to keep doing this for?

22:32.406 --> 22:33.940
What? When we're 50 or
60? When does it end?

22:34.041 --> 22:35.341
When do we just
get to be normal?

22:35.442 --> 22:37.277
'Cause every time I have

22:37.377 --> 22:40.146
to transform back into that
thing, I risk crossing the line,

22:40.247 --> 22:42.481
I risk losing any inch
of humanity I have left.

22:42.582 --> 22:45.451
You know this. You know what
that means? We risk losing us.

22:45.552 --> 22:47.420
I can't...
I can't do it.

22:47.521 --> 22:49.188
I won't do it anymore.

22:49.289 --> 22:53.025
I can't believe
that you would.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.937
Vincent. Hey.

23:05.038 --> 23:06.972
How'd it go? Did
she like the ring?

23:07.073 --> 23:10.642
I don't know.

23:10.743 --> 23:13.378
I didn't ask.

23:23.461 --> 23:24.924
Hey.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.859
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.440
Hey, Heather,
what are you doing here?

23:28.529 --> 23:29.929
I'm saying good-bye.

23:30.030 --> 23:32.098
I'm going back to Miami, remember?
Right.

23:32.199 --> 23:33.519
I'm sorry. I got
a lot on my mind.

23:33.601 --> 23:35.468
Well, so what
else is new?

23:35.569 --> 23:38.104
I hope it's okay, I left a few
things at the apartment. Whoa.

23:38.205 --> 23:40.440
Hey, is that you?

23:40.541 --> 23:42.942
What happened?
It's nothing.

23:43.043 --> 23:44.844
It does not look like
nothing. Are you all right?

23:44.945 --> 23:47.613
Yes, I'm fine. I just...
I have a couple bruises.

23:47.714 --> 23:48.981
Does Vincent know?

23:49.082 --> 23:50.817
Yeah, he knows.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.952
Oh. Oh, is...?

23:53.053 --> 23:54.453
Is this a beast case?

23:54.554 --> 23:58.857
No. I mean, yes,
it is, sort of.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.125
It's complicated.

24:00.226 --> 24:02.628
Complicated how?

24:02.729 --> 24:05.096
No more secrets, remember?
You can talk to me.

24:06.433 --> 24:09.635
I don't know what to do.

24:09.736 --> 24:12.170
You know how much
I love Vincent.

24:12.271 --> 24:13.972
I would do
anything for him.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.473
Are you guys fighting
or something?

24:15.574 --> 24:16.875
Yeah. Big-time fighting.

24:16.976 --> 24:19.744
Problem is,
I don't blame him.

24:19.846 --> 24:23.882
He wants us to have
a normal life, and so do I, but

24:23.983 --> 24:26.584
when stuff like that happens,
I can't just put up blinders

24:26.685 --> 24:28.005
and pretend like
everything's fine

24:28.087 --> 24:30.155
because it isn't.

24:30.256 --> 24:31.922
On the other hand,
if I do something about it,

24:32.023 --> 24:33.691
that gets Vincent involved,

24:33.792 --> 24:36.260
and aside from the fact that
he doesn't want to be involved,

24:36.362 --> 24:39.564
it also puts his life at risk,
and I don't want that either.

24:39.665 --> 24:41.666
You mean, at risk because
of the humanity thing?

24:41.767 --> 24:43.033
No, because of every thing.

24:43.134 --> 24:45.336
I saw firsthand

24:45.437 --> 24:49.039
what he'd be up against, and
it scares the hell out of me.

24:50.641 --> 24:53.610
But it's my life, too,

24:53.711 --> 24:56.280
and I can't help feeling like
I'm supposed to do something,

24:56.381 --> 24:58.182
that <i>we</i> are supposed to.

24:58.283 --> 25:03.920
Yeah, well... you can't make
this decision on your own, Cat.

25:04.021 --> 25:06.890
It's a couple's problem.

25:06.991 --> 25:09.693
An admittedly unique
couple's problem,

25:09.794 --> 25:13.263
but it's a
couple's problem.

25:13.364 --> 25:16.232
Which means you guys got
to get in sync about it,

25:16.333 --> 25:18.368
make sure you're
on the same page.

25:18.469 --> 25:20.703
And the only way you're ever
going to be able to do that

25:20.804 --> 25:22.638
is if you talk
to each other.

25:22.739 --> 25:24.941
So go find Vincent.

25:25.042 --> 25:27.343
Finish your fight.

25:35.419 --> 25:37.486
Yes! All right!

25:42.158 --> 25:45.428
I don't want a pep talk.

25:47.931 --> 25:50.566
Well, too bad, 'cause
you're gonna get one anyway.

25:52.235 --> 25:54.069
Besides, considering
all the pep talks

25:54.170 --> 25:57.005
I've had to suffer through
lately, it's only fair.

25:57.106 --> 25:59.975
All right, take a seat, but
there's nothing to talk about.

26:00.076 --> 26:02.077
Really?

26:02.178 --> 26:03.979
You go to propose
to your girl

26:04.080 --> 26:05.948
and you come back
all pissed off.

26:08.084 --> 26:09.984
What happened?

26:11.119 --> 26:12.520
I don't know.

26:12.621 --> 26:14.689
We just don't see
eye-to-eye, that's all.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.123
Since when?

26:16.224 --> 26:17.692
Since Catherine decided

26:17.793 --> 26:19.093
to become a beast hunter again,
or whatever the hell

26:19.194 --> 26:20.795
is out there now.

26:20.896 --> 26:22.530
Man.

26:22.631 --> 26:25.800
Apparently, those DHS agents
have been trying to recruit her,

26:25.901 --> 26:27.634
and-and now they're telling her
that they found something.

26:27.735 --> 26:28.970
So, that's it?
That's why you didn't propose?

26:29.071 --> 26:31.439
JT, something attacked them,
okay,

26:31.539 --> 26:33.139
killed one of the
agents. One's critical.

26:33.208 --> 26:34.528
And Catherine's
sure as hell lucky

26:34.609 --> 26:35.909
she wasn't killed, too.

26:38.246 --> 26:40.281
I don't know, man. It's...

26:40.382 --> 26:41.849
I just... I can't believe

26:41.950 --> 26:43.684
that she would put herself
in that position.

26:43.785 --> 26:46.487
You know, I-I can't believe
that she would even want to.

26:46.588 --> 26:49.255
Maybe she didn't think
she had a choice.

26:50.792 --> 26:52.626
I'm just saying,
if there are still things

26:52.727 --> 26:54.127
that go bump
in the night out there,

26:54.128 --> 26:55.395
what's she supposed to do?

26:55.497 --> 26:57.030
She can't just ignore it.

26:58.933 --> 27:01.968
Vincent, I know how much
you want a normal life,

27:02.069 --> 27:04.837
and God knows nobody deserves it
more than you do,

27:04.938 --> 27:07.140
but let's get real.

27:07.241 --> 27:09.142
You're not normal.
You're a beast.

27:09.243 --> 27:11.844
Is this your idea of a pep talk?

27:11.945 --> 27:16.215
Look, Muirfield may have only
cared about turning you

27:16.316 --> 27:18.518
into a super soldier originally,

27:18.619 --> 27:21.020
but it's become
much more than that.

27:21.121 --> 27:24.256
I mean, look at all the good
you've done since. Plus,

27:24.357 --> 27:27.059
with Rebecca and Alistair,
ancient protobeasts,

27:27.160 --> 27:29.328
you can't deny you're part
of something bigger,

27:29.429 --> 27:30.863
which means
you can't just put your head

27:30.964 --> 27:33.232
in the sand and wish it all away.
So what?

27:33.333 --> 27:36.001
I just got to give up everything
that I've ever wanted?

27:36.102 --> 27:38.570
Risk my life, Catherine's life,
hell, even your life?

27:40.106 --> 27:43.175
Who says
we got to keep doing this?

27:43.276 --> 27:46.878
Destiny?

27:48.981 --> 27:51.182
The agents saved my life
for a reason, Vincent,

27:51.283 --> 27:52.617
but it wasn't for me.

27:52.718 --> 27:55.353
They knew
there was something out there,

27:55.454 --> 27:58.690
and they knew they'd need yours
and Cat's help to stop it.

27:58.791 --> 28:02.126
Believe me,
I'm not thrilled

28:02.227 --> 28:05.163
any of this happened,
either, but it has.

28:07.299 --> 28:10.801
The only question left is, what
are we going to do about it?

28:20.546 --> 28:23.413
Hey. Excuse me.

28:23.514 --> 28:25.248
Could you please
find out what room

28:25.349 --> 28:27.051
Agent Jack Thomas
has moved to?

28:27.151 --> 28:28.418
I think, fifth floor ICU.

28:28.519 --> 28:29.954
Yeah, room 526.

28:30.055 --> 28:31.321
How's he doing?

28:31.422 --> 28:32.790
He's listed as critical
but stable.

28:32.891 --> 28:35.826
Good, thanks.

28:40.498 --> 28:42.031
Hey!

28:50.340 --> 28:52.841
Agent Thomas.

28:55.512 --> 28:57.813
If you don't stop this...

28:57.914 --> 28:59.448
who will?

29:08.758 --> 29:10.358
Nurse!

29:10.459 --> 29:12.628
Nurse!

29:17.566 --> 29:19.033
Vincent!

29:21.537 --> 29:23.338
Vincent, wait! Don't!

29:31.280 --> 29:33.682
Give me a break.
You can't park there!

29:33.783 --> 29:35.384
So you don't
know for sure

29:35.485 --> 29:37.052
whether Zane's even in here or not?
I remember

29:37.153 --> 29:38.887
his wife said he threatened
to blow up his building.

29:38.988 --> 29:41.089
It's all I've got.
This is all my fault.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.658
W-Wait. Maybe you ought to
try calling Vincent again.

29:42.759 --> 29:44.492
He's not answering
and he's not going to.

29:44.593 --> 29:46.928
I know that look. He's on a
mission, he's out for blood,

29:47.029 --> 29:49.231
which means I have to stop
him before he stops Zane.

29:49.332 --> 29:51.666
Wait. I'm confused. Don't
we want Vincent to stop him?

29:51.767 --> 29:54.369
He may not be able to, and
if he does, he'll kill him.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.604
Either way, I lose Vincent.
I'm not following.

29:56.705 --> 29:58.439
When DHS told us
about a worse threat,

29:58.540 --> 30:00.342
they weren't kidding.

30:00.442 --> 30:03.010
Vincent's never been up against
anything like this before,

30:03.111 --> 30:04.345
and he might have
to cross the line.

30:04.446 --> 30:06.347
And he risks
losing his humanity.

30:06.448 --> 30:08.850
Unless I can stop him.
Plus, despite everything

30:08.950 --> 30:10.585
Zane's done,
he's still an innocent,

30:10.686 --> 30:13.521
which means we have to
save him, not kill him.

30:13.622 --> 30:15.462
Yeah, along with everyone else
in the building.

30:15.524 --> 30:18.525
All right, I'll look for bombs,
you look for Vincent.

31:44.877 --> 31:47.378
All right, hurry,
but don't panic. Everybody out.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.213
Come on, let's go.

31:49.314 --> 31:50.782
Hey, can you check floors?

31:50.883 --> 31:52.316
Yeah.
Thanks.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.656
Roof. Hurry.

32:22.146 --> 32:23.346
Vincent,

32:23.447 --> 32:25.048
no!

32:28.419 --> 32:30.753
Vincent!

32:38.829 --> 32:40.330
Aah!

32:40.431 --> 32:42.265
Vincent...

32:42.366 --> 32:44.634
Listen to me,
you-you cannot kill him.

32:46.302 --> 32:47.670
He is an
innocent.

32:47.771 --> 32:50.205
Someone did this to him.
Someone experimented

32:50.306 --> 32:53.275
on him, just like Muirfield
experimented on you.

32:53.376 --> 32:56.679
Vincent,
please don't.

32:56.780 --> 32:59.615
If you do this, you will cross
a line that you can never

32:59.716 --> 33:01.584
come back from,
and I will lose you.

33:03.453 --> 33:05.387
We will lose
each other.

33:07.323 --> 33:09.724
Vincent, we will
lose everything.

33:35.838 --> 33:37.606
Hope I'm not interrupting.

33:40.509 --> 33:43.645
No, just working out.

33:47.382 --> 33:48.650
Do you want me to leave?

33:48.751 --> 33:51.086
No.

33:51.186 --> 33:53.588
I... You know what,
I don't know, I just...

33:53.689 --> 33:55.623
I don't know
what I want anymore.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.628
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
Of course...

34:00.729 --> 34:03.431
Of course I want you,
okay? That is never

34:03.532 --> 34:05.166
gonna change,
you know that.

34:05.267 --> 34:07.201
It's just, uh...

34:10.572 --> 34:12.005
How's Zane?

34:14.574 --> 34:17.011
He's alive, thanks to you.

34:17.112 --> 34:18.679
No, you mean thanks to you.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.147
I was gonna kill the guy.

34:20.248 --> 34:21.815
But you didn't--
you saved him.

34:21.916 --> 34:23.550
And you saved yourself.

34:23.652 --> 34:26.053
Again, thanks to you.

34:30.424 --> 34:32.292
So what are they
gonna do with him?

34:32.393 --> 34:33.793
Agent Thomas got him

34:33.893 --> 34:35.862
into a secure
medical facility until they

34:35.963 --> 34:38.532
can figure out how to help him.
Well, if they can.

34:38.632 --> 34:40.500
I mean, I don't know what they
did to the guy, but whatever

34:40.601 --> 34:42.802
it was, they sure as hell turned
him into something...

34:42.902 --> 34:44.436
Extraordinary?

34:46.139 --> 34:48.306
That's how Thomas
described it.

34:48.408 --> 34:50.009
He said they're trying
to push the limits

34:50.110 --> 34:51.409
of what's possible.

34:51.511 --> 34:52.844
Yeah, well, they sure
as hell did that.

34:52.946 --> 34:54.647
And they're gonna
keep doing it, too.

34:54.748 --> 34:56.549
That's the point.

34:56.650 --> 34:58.250
According to what they
told me before,

34:58.351 --> 34:59.819
it's only just begun.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.321
They're gonna keep
using New York as their own

35:02.422 --> 35:04.089
private petri dish, using

35:04.191 --> 35:06.258
and killing
innocent people until...

35:06.359 --> 35:07.893
until God knows what.

35:07.994 --> 35:10.062
And what-- I'm-I'm
supposed to stop them?

35:10.163 --> 35:11.697
No, <i>we're</i> supposed to.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.168
We're in this together,
Vincent, or not at all.

35:16.269 --> 35:19.671
I don't want to... I don't want
to force you into anything,

35:19.772 --> 35:21.406
and the last thing
I want to do

35:21.507 --> 35:23.875
is put you in harm's way again.

35:23.976 --> 35:26.178
But what choice do we have?

35:26.278 --> 35:28.113
Okay, and what about us?

35:29.615 --> 35:31.717
About our future-- does
it... does it count?

35:31.818 --> 35:33.118
Of course it counts.

35:34.786 --> 35:37.422
I love you, Vincent.

35:37.523 --> 35:39.857
More than anything.

35:39.958 --> 35:42.660
But I believe
that we can have both.

35:42.662 --> 35:46.063
That-That we can overcom

35:46.164 --> 35:47.565
ready proven that.
But I believe that we can have both.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.667
How many lives did we
save today in that building?

35:49.768 --> 35:52.002
I don't know.
And what would have happened to them

35:52.104 --> 35:53.904
if you hadn't stopped Zane?

35:55.807 --> 35:58.909
We're here for a reason,
Vincent, I know that.

35:59.010 --> 36:01.478
We're together
for a reason.

36:03.348 --> 36:05.950
But it's not just
to love each other.

36:17.228 --> 36:18.729
Hey.

36:18.829 --> 36:20.230
I need a drink.

36:20.331 --> 36:21.732
Okay.

36:21.832 --> 36:23.133
What do you want?

36:23.234 --> 36:24.934
Mm... Can you make a cosmo?

36:25.035 --> 36:26.302
No.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.637
Fine.

36:27.738 --> 36:28.872
Scotch, rocks.

36:28.973 --> 36:30.807
Make it a double.

36:30.908 --> 36:32.441
What happened?

36:32.542 --> 36:35.544
Oh, you know--
same old, same old.

36:35.646 --> 36:37.981
Stopping crazies
from blowing up buildings,

36:38.082 --> 36:39.982
protecting a beast,
covering for Cat.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.652
Just another day at the office.

36:42.753 --> 36:45.288
Yeah, but it's a day
I thought was behind me.

36:45.389 --> 36:46.789
I should have known
our little beast hiatus

36:46.890 --> 36:48.157
was too good
to be true.

36:48.258 --> 36:50.926
Hey, where's
the cane?

36:51.027 --> 36:52.428
Goodwill.

36:52.529 --> 36:54.397
I decided somebody else
probably needs it

36:54.498 --> 36:55.631
a little more than I do.

36:55.732 --> 36:56.999
Really?

36:58.367 --> 37:00.269
It's about time. Cheers.

37:00.369 --> 37:01.603
Don't be so thrilled.

37:03.372 --> 37:05.841
Did you get rid of the
medical supplies, too?

37:05.942 --> 37:08.143
No, I kept those.
I mean, let's face it--

37:08.244 --> 37:10.404
I may be getting better,
but I'm still a hypochondriac.

37:11.915 --> 37:13.315
Good for you, JT.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.650
You just made my
day suck less.

37:15.751 --> 37:17.185
Thanks. I think.

37:18.587 --> 37:19.987
Seriously, though,
what changed?

37:20.088 --> 37:21.623
Besides you kicking my ass?

37:21.724 --> 37:23.692
I don't know.
I guess

37:23.793 --> 37:25.660
I heard you.

37:25.761 --> 37:29.030
And maybe I found the reason
I'm still around.

37:29.131 --> 37:30.698
An old reason, anyway.

37:32.267 --> 37:33.835
You know that crappy day
you had

37:33.936 --> 37:35.803
where you saved
all those people?

37:35.904 --> 37:37.471
Yeah?

37:37.572 --> 37:39.807
It wouldn't have happened
without me.

37:39.908 --> 37:42.509
I mean, not directly because

37:42.610 --> 37:44.678
of me, obviously, but...

37:44.779 --> 37:48.349
on some level,
I helped Vincent realize

37:48.450 --> 37:50.551
he needed
to do something to help.

37:52.387 --> 37:53.887
Batman needs a Robin.

37:53.988 --> 37:57.123
Something like that, yeah.

37:57.225 --> 38:00.794
Still doesn't explain
how that medicine saved me,

38:00.895 --> 38:02.395
but that's a tomorrow problem.

38:02.496 --> 38:04.030
Come on.
No.

38:04.131 --> 38:05.131
Where are we going?

38:05.166 --> 38:06.532
I don't know. Out.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.236
Where someone can
make you a real cosmo.

38:09.337 --> 38:11.271
All right.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.363
Hey.

38:37.463 --> 38:39.999
Hey.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.834
I didn't know when I was
gonna see you again.

38:42.936 --> 38:44.836
I was giving you some space.

38:44.938 --> 38:47.539
Yeah, uh, thanks.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.909
Although part of
me was just hoping

38:50.010 --> 38:52.544
you'd jump across the street
and sweep me off my feet again.

38:52.645 --> 38:55.614
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint.

38:55.715 --> 38:58.283
Never.

39:01.554 --> 39:03.388
You okay?

39:03.489 --> 39:05.189
Yeah.

39:05.291 --> 39:06.792
Yeah, I just, I don't know.

39:06.893 --> 39:08.453
My head's still spinning,
it's been a...

39:08.527 --> 39:10.929
it's been a rough
couple of days.

39:11.030 --> 39:12.163
You think?

39:15.968 --> 39:18.970
Look, uh...

39:19.071 --> 39:22.573
Catherine.

39:22.674 --> 39:24.575
You're right.

39:24.676 --> 39:28.078
I know as much as I want
a normal life, I can't have it.

39:28.179 --> 39:30.080
I'm not normal.

39:30.181 --> 39:32.750
And like it or not,

39:32.851 --> 39:35.152
and for the record
I don't like it,

39:35.253 --> 39:36.787
I don't really have a choice.

39:36.888 --> 39:38.789
<i>We</i> don't have a choice.

39:38.890 --> 39:41.758
Vincent, you've
been given a gift.

39:41.859 --> 39:45.262
It might not have
started out that way,

39:45.363 --> 39:47.897
but it has become that.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.466
And if you
think about it,

39:49.567 --> 39:50.834
it's really not
much different

39:50.935 --> 39:52.502
from why you wanted
to join the army

39:52.603 --> 39:54.571
or why you wanted
to become a doctor.

39:54.672 --> 39:56.239
Or why you wanted
to become a cop.

39:56.341 --> 39:59.342
I keep saying,

39:59.443 --> 40:03.112
I really believe that we're
in this together for a reason,

40:03.213 --> 40:05.114
not just for love.

40:05.215 --> 40:08.952
Except, without that,

40:09.052 --> 40:12.722
I'd be lost.

40:21.764 --> 40:24.100
What are you doing?

40:24.201 --> 40:26.668
Just-- I'm making sure
you don't fall.

40:34.110 --> 40:36.812
