WEBVTT

00:08.928 --> 00:11.621
REGINA: Reginald
told me your news.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.861
You're having a baby.

00:15.763 --> 00:16.832
OLIVIA: Oh.

00:18.702 --> 00:19.738
Yes.

00:20.373 --> 00:21.976
God has blessed you then.

00:22.844 --> 00:24.047
Suppose so.

00:26.251 --> 00:27.921
He's a good boy.

00:28.422 --> 00:31.762
Going to provide a good home
for you and my grandson.

00:32.731 --> 00:35.069
OLIVIA: Well, we don't know
if it's a boy just yet.

00:35.570 --> 00:38.509
Well, I have
a sense of these things.

00:43.819 --> 00:47.094
When Reginald and I
first got married,
we had talked about waiting

00:47.127 --> 00:48.562
before having a baby.

00:49.197 --> 00:51.702
At least until
he was out of med school

00:51.735 --> 00:54.240
or after I figured out exactly
what I wanted to do too.

00:56.078 --> 00:57.680
But now that
I'm pregnant, it's like--

01:00.052 --> 01:02.991
-it's like there
was never another path.
-You should stop there.

01:05.830 --> 01:08.035
Reginald never deceived you.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.840
He's a father, Olivia.

01:10.873 --> 01:12.110
And you're a mother.

01:12.912 --> 01:16.785
This is what you do.
You make sacrifices.

01:18.088 --> 01:19.691
Both of you.

01:19.724 --> 01:23.031
(TV talking in the background)

01:24.801 --> 01:29.677
You know, your problem is
you're too wild.

01:30.513 --> 01:32.884
You oughta watch
that tendency in yourself.

01:34.688 --> 01:38.062
And I say this as someone
who actually knew your mother.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.105
You didn't have it
easy growing up.

01:45.877 --> 01:50.052
I don't know what kind
of mother just ups
and runs out on their children.

01:54.227 --> 01:57.935
But you now have
the chance to do better.

02:01.642 --> 02:02.710
A child...

02:04.648 --> 02:06.785
(chuckles softly)

02:07.554 --> 02:12.830
a child is an opportunity
to think outside yourself.

02:15.670 --> 02:19.878
There is no better,
more mysterious love.

02:23.385 --> 02:26.825
And I suggest you humble
yourself before that fact.

02:36.078 --> 02:38.749
You know, why don't you run
down to the corner store

02:38.782 --> 02:41.087
and grab us a
couple of boxes of candy?

02:41.621 --> 02:43.792
-Would you? Hmm?
-OLIVIA: Yes, ma'am.

02:46.798 --> 02:48.736
Olivia...

02:48.769 --> 02:53.378
This baby,
it might just save your life.

02:54.381 --> 02:57.854
(ominous music playing)

03:03.165 --> 03:07.274
Hold on, Dana.
I'm coming. Come on, Bonnie!

03:07.307 --> 03:09.210
(smacks lips)

03:09.945 --> 03:15.757
KEVIN: Fuck. Winnie?
Winnie! Fuck!

03:15.790 --> 03:20.065
Winnie! Winnie!

03:21.936 --> 03:24.874
Winnie! Oh, shit!

03:35.600 --> 03:37.129
Master Tom own you now.

03:39.457 --> 03:40.525
You his.

03:44.032 --> 03:45.101
That's a lie.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.241
SARAH: I know it is.

03:49.944 --> 03:51.614
I suppose they got into
some sort of argument.

03:52.048 --> 03:54.887
Your Master Kevin
came out on the wrong end of it.

03:55.255 --> 03:56.558
What?

03:56.591 --> 03:57.993
What?
Where is he?

03:58.462 --> 04:00.599
SARAH: How should I know?

04:00.632 --> 04:04.139
Tom only had me come up
here with this here food
to break the news to you.

04:07.212 --> 04:10.017
I suggest that you figure out
how to take yourself on off

04:10.050 --> 04:11.353
to wherever you took Winnie.

04:14.260 --> 04:15.328
Tonight.

04:20.205 --> 04:22.509
I imagine this been
your plan all the time.

04:24.413 --> 04:26.015
And I don't have
a problem with it.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.260
(Sarah sighing)

04:32.329 --> 04:36.170
It's gonna be interesting
around here with you
and Luke gone. Mmm-mmm.

04:40.545 --> 04:42.549
See, this used to be
Marse William's room.

04:45.087 --> 04:46.157
(Sarah hums)

04:48.361 --> 04:49.530
And these walls...

04:54.673 --> 04:56.644
they hold some
powerful memories from it.

05:00.218 --> 05:01.921
I hope you enjoyed
your time here.

05:07.699 --> 05:10.004
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

05:10.037 --> 05:11.608
(fire crackling)

05:11.641 --> 05:13.978
(crickets chirping)

05:16.651 --> 05:20.458
(ominous, tense music playing)

05:28.073 --> 05:30.278
(objects rustling)

05:35.655 --> 05:38.060
KEVIN: Winnie, please.

05:38.093 --> 05:40.132
(heavy breathing)

05:40.165 --> 05:42.469
We can work this out. Whoa!

05:43.003 --> 05:44.306
What you want from me? Huh?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.613
The same as the rest?
The same as Tom?

05:47.646 --> 05:50.385
No, no, no, no.
I-- I don't want
anything from you.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.289
Why you follow me then?

05:52.322 --> 05:57.065
I-- I just-- I just-- just
wanna make sure you're safe.

05:57.099 --> 05:58.501
That-- that--
that everyone was safe.

05:58.802 --> 06:00.572
After the way
that woman treated me,

06:00.605 --> 06:03.712
I don't need nobody else
to worry about my safety but me.

06:03.745 --> 06:07.219
Winnie, you cannot
go back to Tom.

06:07.252 --> 06:10.459
Tom? I ain't going back to Tom.

06:10.492 --> 06:14.032
Five days in a hole in
the ground made me realize that.

06:14.065 --> 06:17.038
I'm running, and I don't need
nobody permission.

06:17.071 --> 06:21.414
I'm running. And if you
really cared about my safety,
you let me go on my own way.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.419
No, that's fine.
That's-- that's fine by me.

06:25.053 --> 06:27.057
If that's what
you think is best.

06:28.594 --> 06:30.165
Give me your clothes.

06:30.198 --> 06:32.102
KEVIN: What?

06:32.135 --> 06:34.240
They cut my hair off
to make me look like a boy.

06:34.273 --> 06:36.611
But I-- I left them
shirt and pants at the house.

06:36.644 --> 06:39.349
Give me your clothes
so I can get out of here.

06:40.318 --> 06:41.487
-Winnie, I--
-WINNIE: Now!

06:45.161 --> 06:47.333
(footsteps thudding)

06:47.366 --> 06:52.409
♪ ♪

06:57.586 --> 06:59.256
NIGEL: Dana?

07:03.364 --> 07:04.666
Where you going?

07:06.304 --> 07:07.406
I'm leaving.

07:07.439 --> 07:09.041
I gotta go get Kevin.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.513
Is he not coming back?

07:14.553 --> 07:15.622
I don't think so.

07:18.594 --> 07:20.565
Listen, I think he's in trouble.

07:20.598 --> 07:22.770
Okay, so it's very important
I go right now. I gotta go.

07:22.803 --> 07:24.071
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:25.073 --> 07:28.114
You think my father's with him?
He hasn't come home yet.

07:30.819 --> 07:32.122
I don't--

07:33.424 --> 07:34.493
I don't think so.

07:35.662 --> 07:37.533
You should go to bed. Okay?

07:37.566 --> 07:39.736
I-- I-- I'm sure
I'll be home soon.

07:41.173 --> 07:42.576
You're lying to me.

07:42.609 --> 07:45.482
(crickets chirping)

07:45.515 --> 07:47.385
-No.
-You are.

07:47.752 --> 07:49.824
You know something.
Something's wrong.

07:49.857 --> 07:51.527
He's never
not came home before, Dana.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.331
-Never!
-(shushes)

07:54.767 --> 07:57.339
I can't wake up Marse Tom.
Okay?

07:58.841 --> 08:00.746
You know what?
Let's go somewhere else.

08:00.779 --> 08:02.282
Yeah? Let's go somewhere else.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.920
Okay...

08:04.953 --> 08:06.223
ALICE: What happened?

08:06.924 --> 08:10.365
She, uh, stole my clothes.

08:10.398 --> 08:11.867
ALICE: Where is she?

08:13.171 --> 08:14.373
She escaped.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.675
Oh, no.

08:19.717 --> 08:21.287
Could, um--

08:21.320 --> 08:23.291
(door creaks)

08:23.324 --> 08:25.629
Winnie mentioned
that there were, uh,

08:25.662 --> 08:28.234
some clothes here,
some boy clothes...

08:29.470 --> 08:31.307
when she stole my clothes?

08:31.340 --> 08:32.409
There.

08:34.279 --> 08:36.817
(footsteps)

08:48.975 --> 08:50.912
-Whoa!
-What?

08:51.414 --> 08:54.319
Uh, what are we doing?

08:54.953 --> 08:57.759
We're staying like this
until Mama Olivia comes home.

08:58.294 --> 09:01.200
Until then, nobody gets in
and nobody gets out.

09:03.337 --> 09:04.673
You can sit down.

09:04.706 --> 09:07.645
(tensed music playing)

09:24.780 --> 09:27.586
(birds chirping)

09:27.619 --> 09:30.725
(low music playing)

09:48.995 --> 09:50.631
-Sarah.
-SARAH: Olivia?

09:51.065 --> 09:52.602
What you
doing out here so early?

09:53.171 --> 09:55.575
It is early.
(chuckles) I'm sorry.

09:55.608 --> 10:00.351
Um, I need you to wake up Carrie
and have her fetch Dana
from the house for me.

10:01.187 --> 10:05.862
I have a message to give
to her and it's very important.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.298
There's not much time.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.569
It's from her white man,
ain't it?

10:11.540 --> 10:13.244
You know,
I never really liked her.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.917
I certainly never liked
how much you seem
to be out here helping her.

10:18.855 --> 10:19.923
Troublemaker.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.533
In fact, the two of you
always struck me as being
sort of similar in that way.

10:26.035 --> 10:28.775
Could just as well be kin.

10:28.808 --> 10:30.411
Should have seen that earlier.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.549
What are you talking about?

10:33.684 --> 10:36.390
If you hadn't shown up
when you did,

10:36.423 --> 10:38.427
folks around here might
actually have had a chance.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.536
Ain't nobody tell you to swoop
in here however many years ago

10:42.569 --> 10:44.707
and start saving
that redheaded heifer's babies.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.310
You and that Dana of yours.

10:46.343 --> 10:48.448
Sarah, what are you saying?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.883
Stop playing dumb with me.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.925
What you think, Margaret lost
all five of them babies

10:53.958 --> 10:55.394
in a row for nothing?

10:56.062 --> 10:57.799
Huh? For no reason?

11:00.371 --> 11:02.909
I was taking care of them
long before they could
make it out of her.

11:03.644 --> 11:05.849
And if you would've
just left well enough alone,

11:05.882 --> 11:07.418
Rufus would've died
in that crib.

11:09.523 --> 11:11.058
Why'd you save him, Olivia?

11:13.096 --> 11:16.571
If you would've just let the boy
alone, Tom would've gotten rid

11:16.604 --> 11:18.707
of that bitch and this place
would be a whole lot different.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.851
But see, that's all sorted now.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.086
'Cause that child gone...

11:26.757 --> 11:28.561
and his damn mother gone,

11:28.594 --> 11:31.300
and Luke gone,
and now Dana gone too.

11:34.539 --> 11:36.811
Now finally folks
gonna have a chance again.

11:36.844 --> 11:37.912
Gone?

11:39.616 --> 11:40.918
Where did Dana go?

11:42.054 --> 11:46.364
I told her to take herself
on off to wherever it is
the two of you took Winnie.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.567
-Oh.
-SARAH: Oh, yes.

11:49.302 --> 11:51.006
I know you had
something to do with that.

11:51.039 --> 11:53.477
Something to do with what?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.619
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

11:57.652 --> 11:58.954
Oh, Master Tom.

11:59.890 --> 12:03.965
I'm just telling Miss Olivia
here about some idle chatter.

12:03.998 --> 12:05.902
What are you
doing here so early?

12:05.935 --> 12:10.579
Oh, I just came
through to get
a few packets of Sarah's crisps.

12:10.612 --> 12:13.049
(chicken clucking)

12:15.521 --> 12:16.623
Where's Dana?

12:19.529 --> 12:21.901
Last I saw
she was in the guest bedroom.

12:21.934 --> 12:24.139
TOM: I just checked
the house and she's gone.

12:24.172 --> 12:28.480
Well, perhaps she lurking
around Winnie's old cabin, sir.

12:29.649 --> 12:33.858
I noticed she liked
to hide out sometimes there
when she avoiding chores.

12:33.891 --> 12:37.031
Hmm. Did you tell her?

12:37.064 --> 12:38.701
I did.

12:38.734 --> 12:40.605
And she was awful distraught.

12:40.638 --> 12:43.611
But I told her,
just-- just give it thought.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.004
-You snake!
-Hush.

12:57.873 --> 13:00.645
That Dana
on her way to your place by now.

13:00.678 --> 13:02.649
Now that he up,
I don't think there's much time.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.920
So if I was you, I'd figure
out how to get on home,

13:04.953 --> 13:06.523
grab her,
and get outta Maryland.

13:08.627 --> 13:10.732
Don't look at me like that.

13:10.765 --> 13:12.034
You ought to be ashamed.

13:13.471 --> 13:14.539
Shame?

13:15.508 --> 13:18.448
What I'm gonna do with shame
when my life is confined

13:18.481 --> 13:20.151
to this cookhouse
day in and day out?

13:21.887 --> 13:22.956
You free.

13:23.924 --> 13:25.594
You always been free.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.070
You ain't got no idea
what it's like.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.479
You can keep that shame.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.485
You were right, Nigel.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.860
I don't think
your father's coming home.

13:43.764 --> 13:44.933
I think he's gone.

13:44.966 --> 13:46.570
Gone where?

13:48.607 --> 13:50.678
I don't know.
I wish I did.

13:53.784 --> 13:55.822
Let me go with you
and Marse Kevin.

13:55.855 --> 13:57.559
-We can find 'em together.
-I can't do that.

13:57.592 --> 13:58.761
Why?

13:59.697 --> 14:02.735
Because Kevin and I are from
a place I-- I can't bring you.

14:03.304 --> 14:05.108
But-- but everyone's gone.

14:05.141 --> 14:08.647
My father, Rufus, and you're
leaving, Mr. Franklin.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.753
What am I gonna do
with everyone gone?

14:21.874 --> 14:23.009
You're gonna be strong.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.681
Okay?

14:27.017 --> 14:28.687
Because that's what
your father would've wanted.

14:30.056 --> 14:32.094
You're gonna learn
to write and read.

14:32.563 --> 14:34.099
Okay? That's what
you're gonna do.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.639
You already know
all the letters and all
the sounds that they make.

14:37.672 --> 14:38.741
That's half of it.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.616
But you have to practice.
You have to practice
every day, okay?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.717
And you have to teach Carrie.

28:59.462 --> 29:02.435
I have to get back,
but I don't know how.

29:02.468 --> 29:03.937
I don't know how.

29:05.741 --> 29:09.682
I have to save him
because I promised him I'd sa--

29:09.715 --> 29:13.123
if something happens to him,
I know it's my fault.

29:13.156 --> 29:14.458
Oh, Dana.

29:16.863 --> 29:18.567
Dana, it's gonna be okay.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.570
No! No, it's not, Niecy.

29:26.716 --> 29:28.386
(Dana sniffles)

29:31.626 --> 29:33.463
It's not...

29:35.767 --> 29:37.069
It's not.

29:40.944 --> 29:43.850
He's the only person who--
who believed me.

29:47.524 --> 29:52.100
He's the only person who
understood what was happening.

29:55.774 --> 29:57.577
-NIECY: How do you go back?
-(Dana sniffles)

30:01.919 --> 30:03.589
I can't control it.

30:06.496 --> 30:08.866
It just happens or not.

30:10.670 --> 30:11.739
Okay.

30:14.945 --> 30:16.749
We're gonna figure this out.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.154
Okay?

30:20.724 --> 30:21.926
We'll get him back.

30:24.665 --> 30:27.104
And then we're gonna figure out
how to make it stop.

30:28.206 --> 30:29.575
Okay?

30:36.054 --> 30:37.457
I think--

30:42.801 --> 30:44.138
I think if...

30:46.242 --> 30:48.078
I make sure
that Rufus stays alive...

30:49.849 --> 30:50.917
and I--

30:52.955 --> 30:56.095
I make sure
our next ancestor is born,

30:56.129 --> 30:57.664
then that'll make it stop.

31:00.737 --> 31:03.876
But I don't even know.
I don't even know
when that would be.

31:08.286 --> 31:10.055
Well, have you checked
the Bible?

31:12.261 --> 31:13.663
What Bible?

31:14.899 --> 31:16.102
The family Bible.

31:18.840 --> 31:23.216
It has the name of every
James ancestor going back...

31:24.785 --> 31:28.693
I don't know how far,
and their birth years.

31:28.726 --> 31:29.795
What?

31:31.599 --> 31:33.903
Wait, Denise.
Where-- where is that?

31:35.440 --> 31:39.681
Well, last time I saw it,
it was-- it was on the mantle
back in Brooklyn.

31:40.517 --> 31:42.755
Mama used to bring it out
on special occasions.

31:42.788 --> 31:43.956
Grandma's?

31:49.902 --> 31:51.672
(objects shuffling)

31:55.079 --> 31:56.148
NIECY: That's it.

32:06.335 --> 32:08.740
(box shuffling)

32:11.746 --> 32:13.850
(paper rustling)

32:15.287 --> 32:17.056
What are you looking for, Dana?

32:17.089 --> 32:19.328
Carrie. If I'm right, her
and Rufus have a child together.

32:19.361 --> 32:23.736
But right before I left
they were separated
for who knows how long.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.043
-NIECY: Right there.
-DANA: Where?

32:27.076 --> 32:30.750
Carrie Ann Blake born 1849.
Is that right?

32:33.389 --> 32:34.858
No, that can't be right.

32:35.260 --> 32:36.762
She was born before that.

32:50.357 --> 32:51.625
Alice.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.671
I was wrong. I was wrong.

32:57.704 --> 32:59.608
-Wrong about what?
-It wasn't Carrie, it was Alice.

33:00.977 --> 33:02.914
Rufus and Alice
have a child together.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.090
That's how it happened.

33:07.124 --> 33:10.062
(pensive music playing)

33:10.095 --> 33:11.298
(birds chirping)

33:14.070 --> 33:16.142
MAN: See anything
you fancy, sir?

33:18.246 --> 33:19.348
I do not.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.919
(horse nickers)

33:32.274 --> 33:33.676
Alice, keep up.

33:34.378 --> 33:36.215
We gotta get back
before sundown.

33:38.987 --> 33:41.259
DANA: Three hours
since I last got here.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.263
NIECY: Okay, wait,
what are you doing?

33:43.296 --> 33:45.968
-DANA: I might still have time.
-NIECY: Time? Before what?

33:46.001 --> 33:47.938
Before I get sent back.

33:47.971 --> 33:49.408
Well, Dana, there's gotta
be something I can do.

33:49.441 --> 33:51.346
No, no, no, don't touch!
Don't touch me.

33:51.379 --> 33:53.717
Don't touch me, please.
I don't wanna send you back.

33:53.750 --> 33:57.824
Please, please.
Just let me focus. Let me focus.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.236
-It's 1880... 1890...
I don't know.
-When is it gonna happen?

34:04.204 --> 34:06.242
(Dana muttering dates)

34:06.275 --> 34:07.878
Maybe it won't happen.

34:07.911 --> 34:09.080
It will.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.385
Should I get help? I--

34:11.886 --> 34:15.226
Gotta see her.
I'll probably be right back.

34:17.230 --> 34:19.702
(phone vibrating)

34:19.735 --> 34:22.741
(Dana muttering dates)

34:22.774 --> 34:24.211
(Niecy sighing)

34:25.045 --> 34:26.849
Alan.

34:26.882 --> 34:28.886
ALAN: Denise, where the
hell have you been?

34:30.190 --> 34:33.763
The NYPD, they called the house.

34:33.796 --> 34:35.266
I just got off
the phone with them.

34:36.202 --> 34:37.737
They found Olivia.

34:38.773 --> 34:40.008
Olivia?

34:43.816 --> 34:45.052
(phone thuds)

34:45.085 --> 34:46.855
ALAN: Hello?

34:48.259 --> 34:49.861
Denise?

34:52.934 --> 34:56.842
(pensive music playing)

36:17.437 --> 36:19.508
Captioned by LADB.
