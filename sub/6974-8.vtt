00:04.104 --> 00:08.871
l always say there's
three kinds of people in the world.

00:08.942 --> 00:12.434
Them who make things happen,
them who watch things happen,

00:12.512 --> 00:16.277
and them who wonder what happened.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.544
l made things happen.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.711
The wrong things.

00:20.787 --> 00:24.746
l caused pain to anyone who came near me.

00:24.824 --> 00:29.318
This tattoo,
it used to be my badge of honor.

00:29.396 --> 00:34.800
But l'm a different man
since l joined group. A better man.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.565
l never thought words like that
would come out of my mouth.

00:38.671 --> 00:44.803
lt's all because of the help and the love
that l found in this room.

00:45.912 --> 00:51.680
- You're new here. ls it Ed?
- Yeah, l'm new to this BS.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.844
Why do you think it's BS?

00:53.920 --> 00:57.651
Listen, l turned my life around.
A lot of us here have.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.386
Our kind of lives go one way.

01:00.493 --> 01:05.055
And you can't change, any more than
you can undo the crimes you've done.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.862
l feel sorry for you.

01:09.335 --> 01:13.931
Don't feel sorry.
You're going to hell just like l am.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.843
Why are you here, Ed?

01:19.913 --> 01:23.940
l drove Victor. He knows l'm right.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.851
- Victor's been doin' good.
- Yeah. Just look at him.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.761
Victor, you wanna talk about it?

01:41.734 --> 01:44.794
l've just been having bad dreams.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.963
Really bad dreams.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.703
What kind of dreams?

01:55.782 --> 01:59.309
Seeing people skinned alive.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.924
lt's a hard road, Victor.

02:07.994 --> 02:12.761
lt's a shock to the system, changing
the way we think, taking charge of our lives.

02:12.832 --> 02:18.327
We're all afraid,
and that fear preys on us night and day.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.802
ln our minds and in our dreams.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.879
You ever get enough of that crap?

02:30.984 --> 02:35.944
The ''shock to the system'' crap?
This ''fear preying on us night and day'' crap?

02:36.022 --> 02:39.753
Those boys are afraid of one thing:
themselves, their true natures.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.989
- You know what l'm saying, Victor?
- Sorta.

02:43.062 --> 02:46.498
What do you mean?
Don't tell me that bull does you any good.

02:46.566 --> 02:50.332
And don't tell me you feel any better
about yourself coming here,

02:50.403 --> 02:53.861
that it makes these nightmares go away.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.704
No, it don't.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.541
Hey.

04:07.614 --> 04:12.244
- Thanks for coming. Sorry about the hour.
- Sounded like it couldn't wait.

04:12.318 --> 04:16.220
No. l needed another set of eyes on it.
l called Scully in, too.

04:16.289 --> 04:21.522
lt's a little late to be looking for a sitter.
What's so pressing?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.961
Victor Dale Potts.

04:28.067 --> 04:31.901
Ex-con. Three-time loser. Career criminal.

04:31.971 --> 04:36.670
He was murdered five days ago.
Scully's got the crime report.

04:36.776 --> 04:41.611
- l'm sorry, what am l missing?
- lt's the way he was killed.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.784
Agent Doggett.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.952
Agent Scully.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.429
l'd like him to see the body.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.501
Damn.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.947
l seen a bunch of these when l was a cop.
lt's a favorite of Pan-Asian gangs.

05:19.018 --> 05:23.011
The difference is, Victor Potts
had a premonition of his death.

05:23.122 --> 05:26.216
- And?
- That was my question.

05:26.326 --> 05:32.162
What l'm saying is, this man was skinned
alive just hours after describing it in detail.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.961
Maybe somebody had threatened him.

05:35.034 --> 05:39.300
He said it came in a dream, according to
the woman who last spoke to him.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.738
- Who's that?
- Dr Lisa Holland.

05:41.841 --> 05:46.369
She's a therapist who runs an
anger management group for ex-cons.

05:48.381 --> 05:53.182
A lifelong criminal's bound to have
some bad enemies, people capable of this.

05:53.252 --> 05:57.382
Unless there's something here
that l'm just not seeing.

05:57.490 --> 06:02.086
From my visual exam, the skin
was removed with considerable skill,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.686
by someone using a hunting-type knife.

06:05.098 --> 06:10.536
Arteries and veins were left intact so as
to prolong the period the victim would suffer.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.163
Terrible way to die, for sure.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.732
l know.

06:18.745 --> 06:22.545
ls there anything else, Agent Reyes?

06:24.584 --> 06:30.887
Something special that brought this case
to your attention as a possible X-File?

06:30.957 --> 06:32.117
No.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.192
l just know l need to solve this,
and l'd appreciate your help.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.942
- Are you Reyes?
- l'm Doggett. She's Reyes.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.544
- Detective Van Allen?
- That's right.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.956
- l appreciate your help on this.
- What help is that?

07:07.059 --> 07:10.551
- On this investigation.
- There isn't a lot to investigate.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.463
Victor Potts wasn't one of
the FBl's Ten Most Wanted.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.797
l think she means your insight
into the way he died.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.235
Don't have any.

07:19.305 --> 07:25.574
But l'm sure you'd rather talk to somebody
who actually gives a damn, right?

07:28.614 --> 07:33.813
l hate to say it, but he probably sums up
most people's feelings.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.980
lt's hard for the Victor Pottses of the world.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.856
Nobody cares much about them
in life or in death.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.658
Victor told the group a story,
about a dream he'd had.

07:45.765 --> 07:49.599
These men are haunted by their pasts.
That's why they're here.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.796
But this dream came true.

07:51.871 --> 07:56.501
Sometimes the past they want to escape
won't let them.

07:58.144 --> 08:02.877
There was a man - Ed.
He drove Victor to group that night.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.974
He was all over Victor's case.

08:05.051 --> 08:08.418
You think he could have killed him?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.150
l try to help these men.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.627
Some have been violent, some still are.
lt's not my place to judge them.

08:15.695 --> 08:19.631
Dr Holland, there's justice to be served here.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.864
You can't forget that.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.494
l'm sure Agent Reyes won't let me.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.563
Probably won't let anybody.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.571
Thank you for your help.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.182
She contacted you with this case?

08:45.258 --> 08:50.992
l think the police would have given up
on who murdered Potts if it wasn't for her.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.265
You know something, Agent Reyes?

09:02.341 --> 09:04.571
You seem real familiar to me.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.406
Excuse me?

09:06.512 --> 09:09.276
You ever visited Novi before?

09:10.616 --> 09:13.346
No, l never have.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.910
You eyeballin' me? You got
some kind of problem or somethin'?

09:45.985 --> 09:49.614
Problem? Your friend is dead.

09:49.722 --> 09:53.818
Yeah. l guess the good news is
l get to move up the ladder here now.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.724
You know how it happened.

09:59.465 --> 10:02.161
Why don't you just back off?

10:02.268 --> 10:06.295
The FBl wants to talk to me now
because of the way he died.

10:06.405 --> 10:10.637
- They wanna talk to you, too.
- l got nothin' to tell nobody.

10:10.743 --> 10:14.509
- You were messing with his head.
- l'd watch what you go sayin'.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.175
Or what? You're gonna do me, too?

10:22.288 --> 10:25.189
l got a ride to catch.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.487
That's right, walk away.

10:31.597 --> 10:35.124
But, just like you said,
you can't run from what you are.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.465
Yeah?

10:37.536 --> 10:40.027
And l'll see you in hell.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.777
Here you go, Dr Scully.

11:28.854 --> 11:34.383
Everything you ever wanted to know about
skinning people but were afraid to ask.

11:34.493 --> 11:39.590
This is every case of removal of the human
dermis l could find within the last 12 years.

11:39.665 --> 11:43.431
- Most of these are postmortem skinnings.
- That's all l could find.

11:43.502 --> 11:46.699
Most of it's Asian-gang related,
like you mentioned.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.503
Wait a minute. What's this?

11:54.447 --> 11:59.282
l probably shouldn't have included that one.
lt's pretty much ancient history.

11:59.385 --> 12:04.846
There's a pattern. The way the skin's
been stripped off, it's identical.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.018
How could it be?
Did you notice the date?

12:09.862 --> 12:11.727
1960.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.979
Excuse me?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.921
Dr Muehler?

12:40.126 --> 12:43.061
Dr Bertram Muehler?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.260
Yes?

12:45.331 --> 12:48.425
My name is Dana Scully.
l'm with the FBl.

12:48.501 --> 12:53.495
l want to ask you some questions about
a John Doe you did an autopsy on in 1960.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.942
You honestly expect me to recall
some case from way back when?

12:59.011 --> 13:01.411
l'm 84 years old.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.280
This particular victim was skinned alive.

13:15.995 --> 13:21.126
ln all my days, l never saw
anything as inhuman as this.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.999
l haven't located police records
from the investigation.

13:26.105 --> 13:31.133
Was there ever a suspect who was charged
or arrested in this case as far as you know?

13:31.944 --> 13:34.970
No suspects.
No investigation, for that matter.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.674
l don't understand.

13:36.782 --> 13:41.310
The victim was a John Doe, a nobody.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.948
Carl Hobart, the county sheriff,
figured he was a drifter.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.221
Hobart said he didn't want
to stir up the community.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.659
And no one called him on that?

13:50.729 --> 13:54.961
l tried. The sheriff had other things
on his mind, l suppose.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.729
Why do you say that?

13:56.836 --> 14:01.637
lt wasn't long after that
he put a bullet through his head.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.003
What are you thinking, Doctor?

14:06.078 --> 14:11.015
This is some copycat murder,
40-odd years later?

14:11.817 --> 14:15.981
lf so, it's the most perfectly executed
that l've ever seen.

14:16.055 --> 14:20.219
And why copy an obscure murder
that nobody's ever even heard of?

14:20.326 --> 14:23.227
A string of murders.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.263
l'm sorry?

14:25.364 --> 14:30.563
l thought you knew.
John Doe was only the first.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.406
l'm workin' in here.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.472
That you, Ed?

15:18.217 --> 15:20.048
Come see what l got for ya.

15:49.248 --> 15:54.345
Tell you what, you best
clear the hell out, whoever you are.

16:39.498 --> 16:43.059
Oh God, no! Let me go. Let me down.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.164
Dr Holland?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.099
Lisa?

17:38.457 --> 17:40.789
Dr Holland?

17:55.607 --> 17:57.404
Monica?

17:57.943 --> 18:01.140
What the hell are you dreamin' about?

18:02.314 --> 18:06.751
Nothing. lt was a nightmare.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.049
How did you know?
To come in here?

18:09.121 --> 18:14.058
l was on the phone. l could hear you
through the wall, calling out.

18:15.794 --> 18:19.127
- Who were you on the phone to?
- Dr Lisa Holland.

18:19.231 --> 18:24.396
That anger management group she runs,
it's getting smaller.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.606
l'm gonna need to see some identification.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.802
- lt's OK, let 'em through.
- Go ahead.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.748
- What happened to the lights?
- Somebody cut 'em.

18:36.815 --> 18:40.945
You might wanna watch your step.
We got some blood on the floor.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.915
Not as much as you'd expect.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.422
- Oh, my God.
- You OK?

18:53.432 --> 18:55.297
Monica?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.144
Agent Reyes.

19:10.215 --> 19:14.549
l got a call from Agent Doggett.
He said there's another victim.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.281
Monica? You OK?

19:18.891 --> 19:22.952
- l'm just catching my breath.
- l've got something to show you.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.526
Case files from crimes back in 1960.

19:28.133 --> 19:31.500
- What are they?
- More skinned bodies.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.136
Cut with the same precision
as the body l examined.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.138
Can l see that light a second?

19:52.057 --> 19:55.151
He's still alive.
Somebody get in here and get him down.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.218
We need a medic in here.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.923
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

20:00.032 --> 20:03.490
Who did this to you?
Do you know who did this to you?

20:18.283 --> 20:21.514
- Are we goin' somewhere?
- You're not. Get out.

20:21.587 --> 20:24.215
- Eddie?
- What did l just say?

20:25.424 --> 20:29.258
- l'm not even dressed.
- What else is new?

20:29.361 --> 20:31.420
Get out.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.434
Why are you such ajerk?

20:51.950 --> 20:54.316
Get her outta here.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.966
FBl. Stop right there.

21:24.816 --> 21:28.775
What part of ''Stop right there''
did you not understand?

21:45.203 --> 21:47.967
He's just waiting for his lawyer?

21:48.040 --> 21:51.134
He's in a bad place.
l've been there myself,

21:51.209 --> 21:55.543
sitting right where he is now,
not thinking you have a chance.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.638
You ever murder two men?

21:57.716 --> 22:02.050
He's four years out of prison, holding down
ajob, showing up to work sober.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.351
Why do it? Kill a friend, then a coworker?

22:05.457 --> 22:09.450
You're the one that said he was a hothead.
Why run if you're not guilty?

22:09.528 --> 22:13.521
Bag packed to hit the road.
Packed with knives.

22:14.399 --> 22:18.665
l don't think we're gonna find
the murder weapon on him.

22:19.237 --> 22:25.335
- What makes you say that?
- l think he's running from something else.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.070
l wanna talk to him.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.163
Hi. My name is Monica.

22:47.833 --> 22:51.929
l know what you're thinking.
That l must be the good cop.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.673
No such thing.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.875
You didn't do it, did you?

23:06.184 --> 23:11.383
Your friend Victor,
he said he had bad dreams.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.225
Seeing things.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.396
l think you're seeing them now.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.231
How would you know?

23:29.941 --> 23:32.102
Maybe l see them, too.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.377
Can l talk to you for a second?

23:50.295 --> 23:53.389
You wanna explain to me
what you're doing in there?

23:53.465 --> 23:56.923
- l'm trying to make a connection.
- Hell of a way to do it.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.334
l can see this guy's defense already.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.498
''Your Honor, l was having bad dreams.
Seeing things.''

24:02.607 --> 24:06.099
''Ask Agent Reyes.
She's seeing 'em, too.''

24:07.979 --> 24:10.948
Something you're not telling me?

24:11.016 --> 24:13.450
You two about finished?

24:13.518 --> 24:15.452
With what?

24:15.520 --> 24:18.512
The suspect. He's not our man.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.786
- What are you talking about?
- Girlfriend vouched for him.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.921
Said they were getting hammered
at the Bent Oak from six till closing.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.591
Bartender confirms it.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.339
l don't believe this.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.644
l know where you live, partner.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.510
You're always welcome at group.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.190
Agent Reyes.

24:59.297 --> 25:03.324
l need you to come to Quantico right away.

25:03.401 --> 25:04.834
Why?

25:04.903 --> 25:08.202
l have something to show you.

25:10.575 --> 25:13.043
- Agent Scully?
- Agent Reyes.

25:13.812 --> 25:17.908
- What are these?
- l showed you files of men killed in 1960.

25:18.016 --> 25:23.579
Skinned alive. l had two bodies exhumed,
looking for crossover forensic details.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.349
- Are there any?
- Yes.

25:25.423 --> 25:29.917
There are cuts in the bone,
on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles,

25:30.028 --> 25:34.021
that match the cutting patterns
l found on Victor Potts -

25:34.099 --> 25:39.162
using the exact same knife,
which left a signature pattern of grooves.

25:40.405 --> 25:43.499
Same knife, same killer.
That's what you're saying?

25:43.575 --> 25:47.033
lt's even weirder than that.

25:49.114 --> 25:54.177
l ran bios and backgrounds
from the victims from 1960.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.188
They were both ex-convicts?

25:58.256 --> 26:00.781
But look at the date that they died.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.917
March 8, 1960.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.053
June 21, 1960.

26:05.130 --> 26:10.568
Birth dates of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit.

26:11.736 --> 26:17.868
Potts and Pruit were born on the exact same
dates that the previous victims died.

26:18.877 --> 26:23.211
You knew that we'd find something like this,
didn't you, Agent Reyes?

26:23.281 --> 26:24.748
How?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.921
- John Doggett.
- Where are you?

26:40.999 --> 26:44.730
Outside the suspect's house,
wondering where the surveillance is.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.567
- l need a birth date on him.
- Who?

26:47.639 --> 26:52.303
The suspect, Ed Kelso.
lt's important. He may be in danger.

26:52.410 --> 26:56.244
And he may be gone. l'll call ya.

27:08.093 --> 27:12.462
Yeah. This is John Doggett.
l need to speak with Detective Van Allen.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.590
l'll hang on. Just get him.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.298
l'm still holding.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.086
l said this house
was supposed to be under 24-hour watch.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.558
The patrolman wasn't gone five minutes.

28:16.661 --> 28:21.325
You see that man in there? You think it takes
five minutes to do that to somebody?

28:21.399 --> 28:24.027
l don't know how long it takes,
Agent Doggett.

28:24.102 --> 28:27.094
l only know you said
watch him so he don't run.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.239
Agent Doggett.

28:37.782 --> 28:40.273
l have something to tell you.

28:47.792 --> 28:53.628
This thing with the birthdays is weird,
no doubt about it.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.565
Looks to me like we're dealing with
a real sick puppy.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.625
l don't think so.

28:58.737 --> 29:04.141
Choosing your victims because of their
birth dates - it's the definition of a serial killer.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.870
We should get the boys
from Behavioral Science out.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.640
No.

29:10.715 --> 29:13.411
That's not what's happening here.

29:13.485 --> 29:17.285
- lt's the only thing that makes sense.
- To you.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.422
What do you think it is?

29:29.234 --> 29:32.135
He knew he was going to die.

29:34.939 --> 29:38.067
He had a premonition of his death.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.473
Just like the first victim did.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.411
So how do you figure that?

29:45.483 --> 29:48.680
l'm involved in this some way.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.915
l have some kind of memory of it.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.519
lt's all happened before,
and now it's happening again.

29:56.628 --> 30:01.361
You mean that it's a copycat
and you have some kind of recall.

30:02.433 --> 30:08.429
These men... were born to die this way,

30:08.506 --> 30:10.633
the same way they died before.

30:10.708 --> 30:13.040
The same way they died before?

30:13.144 --> 30:16.602
Not the men, but their souls.

30:18.650 --> 30:25.021
Their souls are murdered over and over again
from one lifetime to the next,

30:25.123 --> 30:27.353
by someone who won't let them rest.

30:27.458 --> 30:33.863
How's this happening, their souls
coming back? Reincarnation?

30:34.732 --> 30:37.064
lt doesn't strike you

30:37.168 --> 30:41.332
that these men were all born on the dates
of the previous victims' deaths?

30:41.406 --> 30:43.499
lt strikes me.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.744
lt strikes me that the killer is clever.

30:58.823 --> 31:01.383
A rag is stuffed in his mouth.

31:04.095 --> 31:09.226
A dirty rag... black with soot.

31:23.514 --> 31:28.076
Coal dust... from a coal mine.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.217
How the hell did you know that?

31:34.592 --> 31:36.560
l don't know.

32:07.892 --> 32:11.419
- What are we looking for?
- l don't know exactly.

32:11.496 --> 32:15.592
But if the old files are correct,
there's gonna be a fourth victim.

32:25.843 --> 32:29.506
Looks like Housekeeping
hasn't been here in a while.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.673
You or me?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.979
l'll check out the mine.

36:07.031 --> 36:09.625
You shouldn't have come here.

36:10.635 --> 36:13.695
l'm a federal agent. l'm armed.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.929
Let go of the gun now.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.434
You can't stop it.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.504
You never do.

36:50.174 --> 36:52.233
You always fail.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.937
lt's your lot.

37:01.919 --> 37:04.012
Agent Reyes?

37:11.295 --> 37:13.422
Monica?

37:13.531 --> 37:16.432
Agent Reyes.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.899
Are you hurt? Talk to me.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.905
- He was here.
- Who?

37:21.973 --> 37:25.374
Van Allen. He's who's killing these men.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.070
Van Allen?

37:27.144 --> 37:34.550
He was skinned himself, back in 1868,
by four men in a mining dispute.

37:34.619 --> 37:37.247
His killers were never punished.

37:37.321 --> 37:42.156
Now he's born to keep avenging
that injustice. Again and again.

37:42.260 --> 37:46.754
- Van Allen's the cop here.
- That's why these cases never get solved.

37:46.831 --> 37:51.598
Every time, four murders.
Every time, four bodies.

37:51.669 --> 37:56.629
Then he takes his own life
so he can just start it up all over again.

37:56.741 --> 38:01.337
There's still a fourth victim
and l think l know who it is.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.782
- Lisa Holland.
- Dr Holland, it's Monica Reyes.

38:09.854 --> 38:15.986
You've seen the visions, like the others in
your group. Visions of people skinned alive.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.591
lt's true, isn't it?

38:19.997 --> 38:22.124
How did you know?

38:24.368 --> 38:28.600
- Where are you now?
- Just finishing a session.

38:28.673 --> 38:30.698
ls there anybody with you?

38:30.808 --> 38:33.436
No, they've all left.
What's this about?

38:33.511 --> 38:38.278
Get out of there. You're in danger. lt's
Detective Van Allen, he's coming after you.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.375
Dr Holland?

38:42.653 --> 38:45.019
Dr Holland?

38:58.536 --> 39:00.629
Time's come.

39:01.972 --> 39:04.031
You're the last.

39:23.728 --> 39:27.391
No use running.
lt always ends the same.

39:40.444 --> 39:43.345
Get the paramedics out here.

39:43.414 --> 39:47.544
You always fail.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.914
You're not dying on me.

39:52.022 --> 39:55.014
Not until you tell me what you mean.

40:20.718 --> 40:24.711
Doc says it's gonna be touch and go tonight,
that we should go home.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.758
Go on, Monica. Go on home.

40:27.825 --> 40:31.283
There's nothing you're gonna learn here now.

40:31.395 --> 40:34.125
You still won't believe it, will you?

40:34.231 --> 40:36.597
My connection to this man.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.266
However you did it,
however you knew what you know,

40:42.339 --> 40:44.967
what matters here is
you saved a woman's life.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.615
He's trying.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.985
We all are.

41:04.862 --> 41:12.530
lt's just a long way to go from...
this to this.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.975
Do you believe in second chances?

41:20.044 --> 41:23.946
A chance to correct
the mistakes we make in our lives?

41:24.014 --> 41:26.107
You mean in a future life?

41:27.318 --> 41:30.879
That's what these people were trying to do,

41:30.988 --> 41:38.690
all the victims, trying to atone for their sins,
from what happened in that photo.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.163
Only this man wouldn't let them.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.396
And Lisa Holland?
What about her?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.972
She was one of them.

41:49.039 --> 41:52.236
One of the men you see standing there.

41:56.046 --> 41:58.378
And you?

41:58.482 --> 42:01.076
Whoever l was, l failed.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.517
ln 1868,

42:03.587 --> 42:05.384
in 1909,

42:05.489 --> 42:08.219
in 1960 l failed.

42:08.325 --> 42:13.888
l was always there but l couldn't stop
the killings. And he knew that.

42:14.665 --> 42:17.600
Just like he knows l'm here right now.

42:17.701 --> 42:25.073
He feels me, the way l felt him when
l saw that picture of the first victim.

42:27.444 --> 42:32.780
And somehow he knows my deepest fear:
that l'll fail.

42:32.850 --> 42:36.047
Maybe in this life you succeed.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.383
Maybe.

42:45.262 --> 42:47.355
Ready, team?

42:57.041 --> 42:59.305
Clear.

43:00.444 --> 43:03.106
100 joules. Clear.

43:03.213 --> 43:05.272
200 joules. Clear.

43:06.650 --> 43:08.743
200 joules. Clear.
