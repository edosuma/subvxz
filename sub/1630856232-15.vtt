00:05.588 --> 00:07.924
How you doing?
Good to see you.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.217
How's everybody?

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
Gwen: Hi, guys.
Oh, my gosh.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.263
The boots with the tee.
I want to go shopping
with you someday.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.639
Niall's here.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.850
God, you're cute.
Look at those pants.
Saunter.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.226
It's almost like a --

00:18.268 --> 00:21.146
You look almost like
a sailor guy. I love it.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.856
I just want
Gwen's boots.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.316
I'm giving you the fishnets
and the boots.
And the boots!

00:25.358 --> 00:27.694
Oh, my God.
Get a shot of them, guys.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.447
John: Her boots might bite you,
so don't cross her.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.657
You know, I've been
trying to use my steal,

00:32.699 --> 00:35.035
and it seems no one
wants me to use it.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.704
Because every time I try,
I fail.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.831
We love when you fail.
It's so fun.
Yeah.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.834
I'm glad you guys
are enjoying yourselves...
[ Laughter ]

00:42.876 --> 00:45.045
...because I am frustrated!
[ Laughs ]

00:45.086 --> 00:46.546
John, you've got
such a great team.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.548
We're just doing
everything we can to keep up.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.468
I got the revenge steal
coming at you, John.

00:51.509 --> 00:54.429
Well, Niall's already stolen
somebody from Team Legend.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.847
**

00:55.889 --> 00:57.140
I'm gonna go with Niall.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.725
John: Oh!

00:58.767 --> 00:59.893
What do you have left?

00:59.934 --> 01:01.561
I have both.
Both?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.521
I'm just happy you guys
are using up your saves

01:03.563 --> 01:05.398
'cause maybe I can finally
get my steal.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.858
This is your time, John.
This is your time.
Finally.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.111
I'm for sure getting one.
Let's let John get one.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.947
Wynonna, are you
having a good time?

01:12.989 --> 01:16.701
I am. Being here has been
so good for my spirit.
Good.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.537
We get to sit here and be
inspired by some great artists.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.914
I know.
We're gonna have fun today.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.624
You're gonna be great.
You're gonna be great.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.584
You're gonna -- We are gonna be
great. It's gonna be fun.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.086
And we're gonna be sitting there
watching each other.
Of course.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.587
We've got Deejay,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.297
Lila, and Stee.
Mm-hmm. Lila, Stee.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.341
Deejay is from Florida.
He's a performer.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.385
He can dance.
He can do anything.
Wow.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.346
Lila is
such a great musician.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.014
She's from
the Pacific Northwest.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.767
And then Stee --
he's gregarious.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.144
He also has
an amazing voice.
Oh, wow.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.938
And he's from
South Carolina.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.358
John: Each of these artists
have real individuality,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.111
and I'm excited to see
what songs they chose.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.487
Hey!
Oh, snap.
John: Look who's here!

01:52.529 --> 01:54.447
We got two legends
in the building.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.282
The legend herself.
Lila: Oh, my gosh!

01:56.324 --> 01:58.952
Deejay: Seeing
Wynonna Judd there...

01:58.993 --> 02:00.620
I want Wynonna
to be my auntie.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.499
Wynonna, please adopt me as your
nephew 'cause you're so sweet.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.959
Lila: I was so excited.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.169
She's a crazy celebrity
that you dream about

02:08.211 --> 02:12.173
and a strong woman
with years of experience.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.300
It's pretty surreal.
[ Chuckles ]

02:14.342 --> 02:17.262
This is exciting.
It's the three-way knockouts.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.430
Wow.
Yeah.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.639
You get to pick
your own song

02:19.681 --> 02:21.641
and really show America
who you are.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.644
It's rough because only
one of you can win the knockout.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.439
We do have a save,
and we do have a steal.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.274
Be save-worthy,
be steal-worthy.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.650
So, who's gonna go first?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.402
I'll be the first victim.
I'll be the first victim.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.988
Deejay!
Take one for the team, Deejay!

02:35.030 --> 02:36.197
You mean victor.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.657
Yeah, victor!

02:37.699 --> 02:39.868
Deejay,
what song did you choose?

02:39.909 --> 02:42.620
I chose "Breakin' My Heart
(Pretty Brown Eyes)"

02:42.662 --> 02:44.539
by Mint Condition.
Oh! Mint Condition.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.125
Oh, you're going
back to my youth.
Me, too.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.960
Yeah, my era of R&B.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.172
* Pretty brown eyes *

02:52.213 --> 02:55.508
I was in a singing group
back in Tampa.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.843
Everywhere we went,
people would say,

02:56.885 --> 02:58.511
"You guys remind me
of Mint Condition."

02:58.553 --> 03:00.638
And I thought
that was really cool.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.684
It's in the era of R&B soul
music that I grew up singing

03:04.726 --> 03:07.562
and a genre that I definitely
would like to be in.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.441
Also, this was the last song
I sang on a stage

03:11.483 --> 03:13.943
before I left on tour
with "Hamilton."

03:13.985 --> 03:17.405
To come back and sing the song
again in front of coaches

03:17.447 --> 03:20.367
that have been in this industry
for a long time,

03:20.408 --> 03:21.618
I'm excited about that.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.495
* Here comes my darling *

03:23.536 --> 03:25.538
Sing that song!
What the heck?

03:25.580 --> 03:27.499
Wynonna:
Deejay gave it so truthfully,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.710
and I'm just so invested
in this show now.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.545
It has brought me
to a new place

03:32.587 --> 03:35.256
of appreciation
of all these gifts

03:35.298 --> 03:37.092
from the next generation
of greatness.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.552
Mm!
Good Lord.
Alright.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.805
Instead of doing the
"Here comes my darling" twice,

03:41.846 --> 03:44.516
I would do
* breakin' my heart *

03:44.557 --> 03:48.019
* Girl got me cryin'
all inside *

03:48.061 --> 03:49.229
Okay.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.730
That's like a money part.
Yeah.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.065
Like, we need
to hear that.
Yeah, I agree.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.484
It's too much of a good thing,
and I like it.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.028
[ Laughter ]
She got quotes.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.739
I feel like a lot of your lines
are actual songs.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.366
[ Laughter ]
They are, kinda.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.992
Your voice
sounds crazy good,

04:03.034 --> 04:05.787
but I don't like
when it's too ad-libby

04:05.829 --> 04:07.497
without having
a purpose.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.249
It should be,
this is intentional melody.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.500
Deliberate --
get out of your head

04:10.542 --> 04:11.960
and into your heart
kind of thing.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.797
So, enjoy yourself because
I'm a Judd, not a judge.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.590
[ Laughter ]

04:17.632 --> 04:19.801
You know what to do.
Thank you.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.388
Deejay sings
with such precision and power.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.681
It's insane.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.726
I want to win this knockout
so badly.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.145
I definitely have my work
cut out for me.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.813
* Just yesterday morning *

04:31.855 --> 04:34.190
I'm singing "Fire and Rain"
by James Taylor.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.943
It definitely brings out
the artist that I want to be.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.945
The old school
singer-songwriter,

04:38.987 --> 04:41.948
folksy, soulful
rock 'n' roll thing.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.533
**

04:43.575 --> 04:44.951
Mic check time.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.786
In the months
leading up to blinds,

04:46.828 --> 04:49.080
I was just hustling, playing
my gigs, working on my record,

04:49.122 --> 04:52.334
and I've clocked so many hours
playing those gigs

04:52.375 --> 04:54.127
in bars, in hotel lobbies,

04:54.169 --> 04:58.923
and now I get to show it
to these mega-celebrities.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.133
It's pretty wild.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.552
* But I always thought
I'd see you *

05:02.594 --> 05:05.638
Wynonna: Lila brings me back
to watching James Taylor

05:05.680 --> 05:10.185
sing that song and weeping,
and I just felt her honesty.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.644
She's got a classic voice,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.897
and it's really easy
on the ears.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.649
It's wonderful.
We need it.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.610
So good.
Yeah.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.820
I need your voice
in my life.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.155
[ Laughs ]

05:22.197 --> 05:23.490
I got my eyes closed.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.824
I'm sitting on my porch,

05:24.866 --> 05:26.785
which is one of my favorite
things to do.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.328
And you would be
what I play.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.913
Thank you.
It's gorgeous.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.166
I love that you do some very,
like, unexpected riffs, too.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.709
That's what's so exciting.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.379
It honors the classic,
but it shows me who you are.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.047
And if you could time
your last vocal

05:39.089 --> 05:41.966
so it's kind of landing right
when the end of that note is,

05:42.008 --> 05:43.426
that'd be lovely.
Yeah. Cool.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.719
I'm always
about sticking the landing

05:44.761 --> 05:46.763
so the audience
can be like, "Aaaah!"

05:46.805 --> 05:48.640
You know, tell them
when to cheer, basically.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.142
I love that, Lila.
Fantastic.
Aaah! Thanks.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.436
Lila is one of a kind.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.939
She tells a story
with her voice.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.816
You tore that up.
Lila: Come on, Stee.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.236
To go up against these two,
it definitely makes me nervous,

06:01.277 --> 06:03.029
and I've got to bring it.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.449
I decided I was gonna do
Maxwell, "Pretty Wings."

06:06.491 --> 06:08.034
Ooh,
I love "Pretty Wings."

06:08.076 --> 06:10.286
* Time will bring the real... *

06:10.328 --> 06:14.416
I've had a great relationship
where I knew what love was

06:14.457 --> 06:16.001
way too early in my life.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.836
I just wasn't
really ready for it.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.339
And I had to let her go
and let her move on.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.882
* Remember me *

06:22.924 --> 06:25.343
With this performance,
I have to make sure

06:25.385 --> 06:28.221
that I'm conveying
these emotions

06:28.263 --> 06:29.556
and making them feel it,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.349
because that's what
it's really all about.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.892
* Pretty wings *

06:32.934 --> 06:35.645
My first two songs were showing
the performer in me.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.896
I wanted people to see

06:36.938 --> 06:38.732
that I could have
a great time on stage,

06:38.773 --> 06:40.734
but with this song,
I really want people

06:40.775 --> 06:44.279
to get a deeper view into
who I am here in the knockouts.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.825
I just was leaning forward,
going, "What?" the whole time.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.244
Like buttah.
Like buttah.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.954
It's so freaking good.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.540
You really sound great
in every aspect of your voice.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.836
My only concern is the last
two-thirds of the performance

06:59.878 --> 07:03.089
feels like it's ad-libbing,
but it needs some structure.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.425
You're the lead singer,
and I want the lead singer

07:05.467 --> 07:10.430
to still carry the song
so that people can focus on you,

07:10.472 --> 07:12.974
and not just
this mass of sound

07:13.016 --> 07:15.393
that's coming from the band,
the backup singers.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
I got you.
You want to be
the focus of attention.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.440
Wynonna:
I loved every minute of Stee.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.692
He chose a very
challenging song.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.445
He is just the package deal.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.947
He is the full meal.
He's got it.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.784
You got a great team.
I love them.
I'm so proud of them.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.786
Our team is crazy.
Aww!
Thank you.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.245
This is gonna be
a tough decision.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.539
All of these artists
are remarkable singers.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.458
Think about,
"How do I go out there

07:38.500 --> 07:41.086
and just be awesome
in who I am?"

07:41.127 --> 07:42.295
Yeah.
That's it.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.463
Thank you.
Give me hugs.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.507
I think the key for each
of these artists

07:45.548 --> 07:47.342
is to have their best moment
on stage.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.470
It's going to be a matter
of when the pressure is on,

07:50.512 --> 07:51.971
who delivers in the moment.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.473
That's who's gonna win
the knockout.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.060
the most, I think, original
person that's on the show.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.354
* 'Cause I know you *

20:29.396 --> 20:31.606
* And you know me *

20:31.648 --> 20:32.899
I think
on those big notes,

20:32.941 --> 20:34.609
maybe just open up
a little bit more.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.736
Well, it's easy to get tight.
Yeah, like a compression.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.488
You feel like you have
to go harder.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.281
You don't have to go harder.
Yes, ma'am.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.492
It's not about
level of 10.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.829
It's sometimes a 2 or 3
can pull me in.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.207
Conway Twitty used
to sing "Hello Darlin'."

20:49.249 --> 20:52.335
Oh, yeah.
And the women were crazy.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.504
I'm excited.
I want to believe it.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.798
You just shock me
every time I'm around you.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.133
That's what I'm here to do,
Gwen.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.677
Yes! [ Laughs ]
You got to keep me around.

21:00.719 --> 21:05.265
* Oh, man, it's getting
kind of hard for me *

21:05.306 --> 21:09.144
* To do the right thing here *

21:09.185 --> 21:17.736
* I want to do the right thing,
baby, yeah *

21:17.777 --> 21:22.073
* Sun on your skin, 6:00 a.m. *

21:22.115 --> 21:25.493
* And I've been
watchin' you sleep *

21:25.535 --> 21:27.454
* Ooh *

21:27.495 --> 21:32.500
* Honey, I'm so afraid
you're gonna wake up and say *

21:32.542 --> 21:36.504
* That you should
probably leave *

21:38.048 --> 21:41.092
[ Laughs ]
* Oh, I know you *

21:41.134 --> 21:43.178
* And you know me *

21:43.219 --> 21:49.517
* And we both know
where this is gonna lead *

21:49.559 --> 21:51.728
Bias, it's really rare
to have someone

21:51.770 --> 21:54.189
that just has
this kind of "it" factor.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.648
Your vocal is so great,

21:55.690 --> 21:56.858
but you don't even
really pay attention to it.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.360
You're just paying
attention to you.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.362
And that's what
an artist is.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.031
The winner of this knockout
is Bias.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.241
Bias,
congratulations!

22:05.283 --> 22:06.534
[ Cheers and applause ]

22:06.576 --> 22:08.495
He's great. He's great.
I love him.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.163
What I like about Bias' voice

22:10.205 --> 22:13.208
is that he has
this soulful quality to it,

22:13.249 --> 22:14.709
and he can do runs.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.753
He's country,
and he kind of surprises you

22:16.795 --> 22:18.672
with some of the choices
that he makes.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.382
I love you.
Thank you, Gwen.

22:20.423 --> 22:23.051
It's really gonna be hard to
compete against his star power.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.761
See you, guys.
Appreciate y'all.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.763
Bias won my heart.
I thought, "Man.

22:26.805 --> 22:30.100
That is somebody
who I-I would like to watch

22:30.141 --> 22:31.768
every night on stage."

22:31.810 --> 22:33.520
Where he gets his energy,
I have no idea,

22:33.561 --> 22:36.731
but [chuckles]
it's just incredible.

22:36.773 --> 22:37.899
Daly: Still to come...

22:37.941 --> 22:40.985
* I'm wanted *
* Wanted *

22:41.027 --> 22:42.821
Daly:
...a knockout so incredible

22:42.862 --> 22:44.364
that Wynonna joined in.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.574
I heard Wynonna singing
the answers over there.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.577
* And I'm wanted *

22:49.619 --> 22:51.830
That just gave me
chills and tears.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.624
* Get out right now *
Yes!

22:54.666 --> 22:56.668
* It's the end of you and me *

22:56.710 --> 22:58.003
Daly: And later...

22:58.044 --> 22:59.337
Oh, shoot.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.839
That's the best knockout
I've ever seen on this show.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.674
...more impossible decisions...

23:02.716 --> 23:04.759
Oh, my God, I hope
I don't regret any of this.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.846
...and the most steals
and saves ever.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.097
A save!

23:09.139 --> 23:10.306
Another steal!

23:10.348 --> 23:13.518
Aaah, come on!
[ Laughs ]

23:20.316 --> 23:21.776
* This is "The Voice" *

23:21.818 --> 23:23.778
Daly:
Welcome back to the knockouts.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.530
Niall: Hello, Team Niall.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.992
Congratulations, everybody,
on making it to the knockouts.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.827
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.871
It's gonna get exciting now.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.415
The next grouping is...

23:35.457 --> 23:37.167
**

23:37.208 --> 23:38.752
...Noah...

23:40.211 --> 23:42.422
...Huntley...

23:42.464 --> 23:43.798
and Claudia.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.383
Ooh!

23:45.425 --> 23:46.676
Noah: Let's go, guys.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.136
Let's put on a show.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.847
I was not expecting
to hear my name after that.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.767
I truly was not expecting
this pairing at all,

23:53.808 --> 23:56.019
which scares the crap out of me.

23:56.061 --> 23:59.564
I'm gonna go start practicing
right now. [ Laughs ]

23:59.606 --> 24:01.399
Shay:
Alright, guys, Team Niall.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.860
This is a taste of what we're
gonna have to do next season.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.278
We love "The Voice."
We're huge fans.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.238
We love working with
the next generation of artists.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.991
There's so much talent out there
that comes through this show.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.910
We love it so much that we're
coming through to be coaches

24:11.951 --> 24:14.871
on Season 25 of "The Voice"
in the first-ever double chair.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.414
I just love how Niall
looks out for us,

24:16.456 --> 24:18.541
even though he's out on tour
and he's doing his thing,

24:18.583 --> 24:20.251
that he left us in good hands.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.544
So, we've been
on a group text with Niall,

24:21.586 --> 24:23.088
we've FaceTimed with Niall,

24:23.129 --> 24:24.881
we've talked about what we're
looking for in the knockouts,

24:24.923 --> 24:27.884
and, man, he was not lying when
he said his team is incredible.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.469
Team Niall is stacked.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.180
The playoffs are up next.
The pressure's on. It's crazy.

24:32.222 --> 24:36.226
Come on down!
The big doors
are opening...

24:36.267 --> 24:39.020
No way!
Let's go.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.439
Wynonna, what is up, dude?
Oh, my God!

24:42.399 --> 24:44.943
Huntley: Having Dan + Shay there
standing next to Wynonna,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.361
it just blew my mind.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.071
Oh, my God.
It is so nice to meet you.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.448
Noah: Wynonna --
she's a legend in country music.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.908
I've been to see her in concert.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.326
I've played Dan + Shay songs

24:53.368 --> 24:55.120
at gigs and weddings
and stuff like that.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.080
So, I mean, it was really cool
to sit in there with them.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.165
Niall speaks very highly
of all of you,

24:59.207 --> 25:00.792
and I cannot wait to hear
what you guys got.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.043
I'm fired up.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.920
Having three people
in this round,

25:03.962 --> 25:06.923
it's feeling much more real
that a big chunk of people

25:06.965 --> 25:09.551
are unfortunately
gonna be sent home.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.429
Daly: We've got a steal!

25:12.470 --> 25:13.930
[ Cheers and applause ]

25:13.972 --> 25:15.348
In this performance,
I really want to show Niall

25:15.390 --> 25:17.392
that he made the right choice
stealing me.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.560
Alrighty.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.811
Just imagine
that it's Christmas time.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.980
Snow is falling,
and Wynonna's there.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.857
[ Laughs ] I know.
No big deal.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.942
No pressure at all.
No pressure at all.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.153
I'm singing "Don't Know Why"
by Norah Jones.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.114
* I waited till I saw the sun *

25:31.156 --> 25:33.742
This song was actually
the very first song

25:33.783 --> 25:35.952
that I played by ear
on the piano.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.955
* Don't know why
I didn't come *

25:38.997 --> 25:40.665
Norah Jones
is absolutely brilliant.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.167
Why did you choose
this song?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.960
I gig in Nashville,
and every time someone's like,

25:44.002 --> 25:45.420
"Play your favorite song,"
it's this one, so...

25:45.462 --> 25:47.380
This is one of my favorite
albums of all time.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.798
I know.
When my wife and I
first met,

25:48.840 --> 25:50.133
we listened
to this album on repeat.

25:50.175 --> 25:51.217
I still do.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.762
I want to show
my jazzy ballad side,

25:53.803 --> 25:55.930
so I'm hoping
to showcase something

25:55.972 --> 25:58.391
that the coaches haven't heard
from me so far,

25:58.433 --> 26:03.355
and I'm hoping John regrets
letting me go [laughs]

26:03.396 --> 26:05.357
when he hears me play the piano.

26:05.398 --> 26:08.109
Wow.
Whoo!

26:08.151 --> 26:11.237
Every goosebump
that can be goosed is goosed.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.072
It's bumping.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.157
You are a singer's singer.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.785
Mm.
I could genuinely
listen to you sing...

26:16.826 --> 26:17.994
Oh, my God.
...all day.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.288
One more song!
One more song!

26:20.330 --> 26:23.124
You've got something
that's rare -- that breathiness.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.336
You are what I listen to
when I'm not singing.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.296
I'm in love with you.
I don't have any notes.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.924
That's the greatest
compliment ever.
Thank you so much.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.592
My only suggestion,
only note...

26:32.634 --> 26:34.844
Yeah.
...is when you get
to that stage,

26:34.886 --> 26:36.471
try to stay
super locked into the band

26:36.513 --> 26:39.307
'cause your pitch, everything
you're playing is perfect,

26:39.349 --> 26:41.726
but it's just about making it
sound like a cohesive unit

26:41.768 --> 26:43.019
for the folks
watching back home.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.354
They're gonna close
their eyes

26:44.396 --> 26:45.772
and feel like
they're listening to a record

26:45.814 --> 26:47.148
if you get
locked in like that.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.692
Do you live in Nashville?
Yeah.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.110
We're gonna come see you.
We're gonna get that schedule,

26:50.151 --> 26:51.486
and we're gonna come.
Please do!

26:51.528 --> 26:53.613
You're incredible.
Don't go changing anything.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.948
You're a phenomenal talent.
Amen.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.283
I was completely blown away
by Claudia B.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.743
Her tone was so pure,

26:58.785 --> 27:00.078
and her piano chops
were incredible.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.871
It was the perfect
song choice for her.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.373
She's gonna go far
in this show.

27:03.415 --> 27:05.291
You're not ready for what's
next. I'll tell you that.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.835
Huntley:
Claudia, she's a contender.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.336
At this point of the show,

27:08.378 --> 27:11.047
everyone's such good singers,
it's nerve-wracking.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.549
I'm sorry, Wynonna.
I might scream.

27:12.590 --> 27:13.883
I like loud.
Are you kidding me?

27:13.925 --> 27:15.218
Making it to the playoffs

27:15.260 --> 27:17.387
would definitely give me
a lot of validation.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.806
Huntley, you just look
like a badass dude.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.057
You do music full time?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.308
I'm a full-time dad
and musician.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.102
I play gigs three to five
times a week.

27:24.144 --> 27:26.271
I love being a dad more
than anything in the world,

27:26.312 --> 27:29.024
so it's pretty cool
to maybe get an opportunity

27:29.065 --> 27:30.358
to make everything work.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.068
Dude, you're here.
Team Niall.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.403
Meant to be, man.
This is awesome.

27:33.445 --> 27:35.488
And I'm doing "Dead or Alive"
by Bon Jovi.

27:35.530 --> 27:36.865
Let's freakin' go.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.951
* And I walk these streets *

27:39.993 --> 27:41.995
This song is about an artist
that has nothing

27:42.037 --> 27:43.246
but a half tank of gas

27:43.288 --> 27:44.664
and his guitar
strapped to his back,

27:44.706 --> 27:45.999
just chasing his dream.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.209
I'll be playing gigs
until 2:00 a.m. at night

27:48.251 --> 27:51.004
and have to drive home an hour
just to make ends meet.

27:51.046 --> 27:53.757
* 'Cause I'm a cowboy *

27:53.798 --> 27:56.926
* On a steel horse I ride *

27:56.968 --> 28:00.597
* I'm wanted *
* Wanted *

28:00.638 --> 28:02.223
* Dead or alive *

28:02.265 --> 28:03.767
Noah: When you hear Huntley,
you know it's Huntley.

28:03.808 --> 28:04.976
It's loud.
It's in your face.

28:05.018 --> 28:06.436
He's the opposite of me.

28:06.478 --> 28:07.687
He is an extrovert,
and I'm an introvert.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.439
It can be
a little intimidating.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.774
That was so sick, dude.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.776
I have one note for you.
Yes?

28:12.817 --> 28:14.110
I need you
to give a little more.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.737
Okay.
That was a joke.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.490
If you give more,
my head's gonna explode.
[ Laughter ]

28:18.531 --> 28:20.450
I heard Wynonna
singing the answers over there.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.702
Oh, I was singing the answers
like I'm in the band.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.121
If you ever need somebody
to do harmony, you call me,

28:25.163 --> 28:26.498
and I'm very serious
about that.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.708
Thank you. It'd be an honor
to sing with you.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.918
Well, duh.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.586
[ Laughter ]

28:31.628 --> 28:33.004
I love Huntley.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.340
I think we can all agree
that he's fire.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.925
[ Mouths words ]

28:36.966 --> 28:38.593
The answer at the end there,
the "wanted,"

28:38.635 --> 28:40.887
I wonder if he could grab that,
like you just did it.

28:40.929 --> 28:44.140
Yeah.
* And I'm wanted, wanted *

28:44.182 --> 28:45.642
Yes!
Okay.

28:45.684 --> 28:47.394
I think that's
the big moment.
Just give us one.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.104
Okay.
'Cause we're
all singing it.
Yep.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.522
When I would listen
to this song as a kid,

28:50.563 --> 28:53.149
there's a line in this song
that inspired me.

28:53.191 --> 28:55.110
"I've seen a million faces,
and I've rocked them all."

28:55.151 --> 28:57.028
That line still moves me
to this day.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.405
What I want you
to do on that line,

28:58.446 --> 29:00.281
I want you to look dead eyes
into that camera,

29:00.323 --> 29:02.450
'cause there's gonna be some
kid at home watching that line,

29:02.492 --> 29:04.452
and you're gonna inspire them
to want to pick up a guitar.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.496
That's so cool to think
about it like that, bro.

29:06.538 --> 29:07.956
Shay:
When you get in that moment,

29:07.997 --> 29:09.457
your braids are, like,
just looking sick,

29:09.499 --> 29:11.209
you're gonna look like
a video game character.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.669
Just -- It's gonna be
so fire.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.337
I'm trying to bring Vikings
here to "The Voice."

29:14.379 --> 29:16.214
Huntley was unbelievable,
dude.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.883
I feel like he had such
a unique tone to his voice.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.593
Bon Jovi fits him
so good.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.345
Good stuff, dude.
Thank you, buddy.
You got this.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.014
He's gonna do great
in this show.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.557
Just a good dude.
You root for him.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.434
What are you gonna
sing for us today?

29:27.475 --> 29:29.686
I'll be doing "Where Rainbows
Never Die," The SteelDrivers.

29:29.728 --> 29:30.854
Love it.
Love it.

29:30.895 --> 29:31.980
I picked this one
because it tugs

29:32.022 --> 29:33.523
on the heartstrings every time.

29:33.565 --> 29:34.941
Huntley: You guys are
going to be blown away, dude.

29:34.983 --> 29:36.276
Thank you.
This dude's amazing.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.194
I love all the friendships
on Team Niall.

29:38.236 --> 29:40.071
We're pretty tight.
That's what
it's all about, man.

* I'm an old man now *

29:42.115 --> 29:43.950
* I can't do nothing *

29:43.992 --> 29:45.869
My dad introduced me
to this song.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.203
When I started playing gigs,

29:47.245 --> 29:49.039
I couldn't drive yet
'cause I was 15.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.623
So, we've spent
a whole lot of time together

29:50.665 --> 29:52.417
throughout the years,
sitting in the car,

29:52.459 --> 29:54.336
listening
to music on long rides.

29:54.377 --> 29:57.213
My dad's been there for me,
always set me up for success,

29:57.255 --> 30:00.091
and it's a really cool
relationship to have with him.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.885
This song connects
with the type of music

30:01.926 --> 30:04.346
that I want to put out there --
country, bluegrass.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.056
It hits close to home for me.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.557
I'm from a close-knit community,
small town,

30:07.599 --> 30:09.392
and I'm hoping to go out there
and make them proud.

30:09.434 --> 30:15.106
* I will make my way
across the fields of cotton *

30:15.148 --> 30:17.150
Man, he's so good.
I love his tone.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.651
Wynonna: If I were Noah

30:18.693 --> 30:21.071
and I was walking
into a group like this,

30:21.112 --> 30:22.822
I would be really nervous.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.575
There's loud and powerful
and drama,

30:25.617 --> 30:28.453
but his voice,
it cuts right through.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.871
We need you.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.247
Means a lot
coming from you.

30:31.289 --> 30:33.166
And I'm gonna cry
because the world

30:33.208 --> 30:36.127
is so full
of noise and chaos.

30:36.169 --> 30:39.130
We need this
to break through the BS.

30:39.172 --> 30:41.091
And that's
what you do to me.

30:41.132 --> 30:42.842
Well, thank you.
[ Chuckles ]

30:42.884 --> 30:45.720
My best advice to you is don't
be anything that you're not.
Yes.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.681
Be the guy that you are because
it's awesome, it's infectious.

30:47.722 --> 30:50.475
You have this moment
a-and thinking of these lyrics.

30:50.517 --> 30:52.602
"But in my day,
I sure was something."

30:52.644 --> 30:55.397
Like, I'd love to see,
like, a little bit of
a smile right there.
Yeah.

30:55.438 --> 30:59.234
As you're thinking
of these lyrics, just react.
Yeah, for sure.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.945
Noah was the silent killer.
He's from Virginia.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.780
He's, like, big
into Appalachian music.

31:03.822 --> 31:06.032
And there's just such
a great scene of country music

31:06.074 --> 31:07.492
coming out of there
right now.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.494
I love the way that he was
connecting with that song.

31:09.536 --> 31:12.080
I feel like he could be
a sleeper in this one.
I agree.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.998
Couldn't be more different.
It's awesome.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.917
And that's what's so great
about this show.

31:15.959 --> 31:19.713
It reestablishes my faith
in the music business.
Shay: It's a beautiful thing.

31:19.754 --> 31:22.841
Well, I'm excited for you guys,
man, and I feel very confident

31:22.882 --> 31:24.259
in y'all's performances.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.428
All three of these artists
are unbelievably talented.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.471
And I think they're all gonna go
far in the music industry.

31:28.513 --> 31:31.099
I know this is gonna be
a really tough decision.

31:31.141 --> 31:33.476
I'm trying to put myself
in Niall's shoes, literally.

31:33.518 --> 31:35.562
I've actually been staying
at his house in L.A.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.022

Horan's hooves.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.066
All: Team Niall!

31:40.108 --> 31:41.317
Honestly, I would not want to be
in his position right now.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.736
There's just
too many good people.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.279
But he does have a save.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.322
So, there's life to maybe
save somebody on his team.

31:46.364 --> 31:48.199
But I still do not envy
that choice.

31:48.241 --> 31:51.077

48:02.132 --> 48:03.717
Ms. Monét:
This is crazy.
How are y'all doing?

48:03.758 --> 48:05.427
Ruby:
But working with two icons

48:05.468 --> 48:07.012
is something I never thought
would happen.

48:07.053 --> 48:10.265
The amount of knowledge that
they have, it's just incredible.

48:10.306 --> 48:11.641
So, it was really, really cool.

48:11.683 --> 48:14.561
I'm singing "Best of My Love"
by The Emotions.

48:14.602 --> 48:15.937
Love that.
Why did you pick it?

48:15.979 --> 48:18.481
It's a good personality song
to show who I am,

48:18.523 --> 48:20.442
and you can't help but smile
when you sing it.

48:20.483 --> 48:24.446
* Doesn't take much
to make me happy *

48:24.487 --> 48:27.365
I sing gospel and R&B
and pop music.

48:27.407 --> 48:31.077
This song is a representation
of who I am as an artist.

48:31.119 --> 48:32.495
My mother was a vocalist,

48:32.537 --> 48:34.330
and she actually had
a record deal

48:34.372 --> 48:35.707
when she was 19 years old,

48:35.749 --> 48:37.834
but she wasn't able
to do that record deal

48:37.876 --> 48:39.210
because of my grandfather.

48:39.252 --> 48:40.462
He was like,
"If you're not singing gospel,

48:40.503 --> 48:41.671
you're not singing anything."

48:41.713 --> 48:43.923
So, she lives vicariously
through me.

48:43.965 --> 48:45.216
* Whoa, whoa *

48:45.258 --> 48:47.093
My mother allowed me
to be the artist

48:47.135 --> 48:48.303
and the woman that I am.

48:48.345 --> 48:49.304
That's why I haven't given up.

48:49.346 --> 48:50.638
That's why I haven't stopped.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.974
* You've got the best
of my love *

48:53.016 --> 48:54.351
* Goin' in and out... *

48:54.392 --> 48:56.394
Reba:
Ms. Monét is a powerhouse,

48:56.436 --> 48:58.646
and I think
she picked a great song.

48:58.688 --> 49:01.649
She knows how
to command attention.

49:01.691 --> 49:04.319
She did a really good job.
I was very proud of her.

49:04.361 --> 49:07.655
Yes, that was so good.
Ow!

49:07.697 --> 49:10.617
We need your womanness.
Uh-huh!

49:10.658 --> 49:13.370
The only note I have
is we're your audience.

49:13.411 --> 49:14.996
Just bring it to us.

49:15.038 --> 49:16.373
Yes.
Yes, I'm with you.

49:16.414 --> 49:18.500
Sometimes I get back here,
and I close my eyes,

49:18.541 --> 49:21.378
and I'm stuck
trying to get it right.
Yeah.

49:21.419 --> 49:23.505
Joy, just let it come.
Yeah, have fun.

49:23.546 --> 49:25.882
And make sure
your breath is deep,

49:25.924 --> 49:27.217
coming from down in here,

49:27.258 --> 49:29.260
because the more
you give me of the "unh"...

49:29.302 --> 49:31.388
Yeah.
...the more I love it.

49:31.429 --> 49:35.850
When Ms. Monét sings,
Ms. Judd listens.

49:35.892 --> 49:37.644
What a velvety voice.

49:37.686 --> 49:39.729
She's seasoned,
and I connected with her

49:39.771 --> 49:41.690
'cause I think
as we get older, as women,

49:41.731 --> 49:43.858
we think maybe
are we not as relevant?

49:43.900 --> 49:47.278
But I think
this could be her time.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.822
Rachele: Watching Ms. Monét,
I was like,

49:48.863 --> 49:50.532
how am I gonna compete
with that?

49:50.573 --> 49:52.325
What am I gonna do?
Just sing!

49:52.367 --> 49:53.702
Rachele: There's two people
going home,

49:53.743 --> 49:55.078
and even though
there are steals,

49:55.120 --> 49:57.038
I do want to try
and actually win this knockout.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.874
I could have never done
a show like this at that age.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.209
I was too shy.
No.

50:01.251 --> 50:02.377
I just admire you already.

50:02.419 --> 50:04.170
Thank you so much.

50:04.212 --> 50:05.547
What you singing
for us today?

50:05.588 --> 50:07.757
"Die From a Broken Heart"
by Maddie & Tae.
Ooh.

50:07.799 --> 50:09.843
I listen to every type
of genre of music,

50:09.884 --> 50:11.845
and I really enjoy
country pop.

50:11.886 --> 50:14.389
It's a new, like,
experience for me,

50:14.431 --> 50:15.598
just to sing a country song.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.975
* Mama, can I come... *

50:17.017 --> 50:19.227
But every round,
I kind of want to up my game.

50:19.269 --> 50:20.645
* This weekend or next *

50:20.687 --> 50:23.106
And this song,
I can relate to it so much.

50:23.148 --> 50:24.190
* How does he sleep... *

50:24.232 --> 50:25.734
At my age, we call it girlhood.

50:25.775 --> 50:28.319
We're all just, like,
trying to figure out ourselves

50:28.361 --> 50:30.447
and going through
a phase of heartbreak.

50:30.488 --> 50:33.491
* Mama, can you die
from a broken heart? *

50:33.533 --> 50:34.743
In this song, it talks about

50:34.784 --> 50:36.202
"Can you die
from a broken heart?"

50:36.244 --> 50:37.412
She feels like her life is over.

50:37.454 --> 50:38.913
And I've been
through that before.

50:38.955 --> 50:41.332
Oh.
Very good.

50:41.374 --> 50:44.044
I just want to hug you.
Just wow.

50:44.085 --> 50:46.713
Thank you.
Oh, you sweet,
sweet spirit.

50:46.755 --> 50:49.466
The only part I heard
was the high note.

50:49.507 --> 50:51.259
Squeeze your butt.

50:51.301 --> 50:52.594
Do whatever it takes
to help

50:52.635 --> 50:53.970
just a little bit
more of an execution.

50:54.012 --> 50:55.764
I didn't know about
squenching your butt.

50:55.805 --> 50:58.099
Yeah, it helps a lot.
I'm gonna try that.
[ Laughs ]

50:58.141 --> 50:59.517
Let me try it right now.

50:59.559 --> 51:01.061
Alright.
Now, here's one more thing.

51:01.102 --> 51:03.813
Whenever you take a deep breath
before your next line...

51:03.855 --> 51:05.273
Yes.
...I saw that on your face.

51:05.315 --> 51:07.650
Yes.
You got to be an actress.

51:07.692 --> 51:11.154
You got to...still get
into it.

51:11.196 --> 51:15.450
Reba: Rachele, I was surprised
by her picking a country song

51:15.492 --> 51:16.785
'cause she's a little more pop,

51:16.826 --> 51:18.661
but I think it just
fit her really well.

51:18.703 --> 51:22.248
She's 17, and already
I've seen her grow so much.

51:22.290 --> 51:24.417
She needs to keep
that confidence,

51:24.459 --> 51:25.627
and she'll do well.

51:25.669 --> 51:27.295
* How does he sleep at night? *

51:27.337 --> 51:29.255
Ruby: Rachele got up there
and sang this country song

51:29.297 --> 51:30.674
and absolutely killed it.

51:30.715 --> 51:32.175
It was like, okay,
now I got some competition.

51:32.217 --> 51:34.678
I'm putting my gloves on,
and I'm walking in the ring.

51:34.719 --> 51:36.638
I'm singing "Blue"
by LeAnn Rimes.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.640
Love that song.
Me, too.

51:38.682 --> 51:41.142
Gosh. What was she,
12, when she did that?

51:41.184 --> 51:42.686
I think she was 11.
Wow.

51:42.727 --> 51:48.650
* Bluuuue *
This song shows off my yodeling.

51:48.692 --> 51:51.611
But it shows that I can also
sing high and low.

51:51.653 --> 51:53.154
* ...for you *

51:53.196 --> 51:54.739
I was 11
when I learned the song.

51:54.781 --> 51:57.158
I'm like, she was 11.
I can do it, too. [ Laughs ]

51:57.200 --> 51:58.785
So, it's like I have to try it.

51:58.827 --> 52:00.453
I played it for my dad
all the time.

52:00.495 --> 52:01.663
Like, I'd sing it
like seven times in a row,

52:01.705 --> 52:03.206
and I'd be like,
was that one good?

52:03.248 --> 52:04.249
This one, this one?

52:04.290 --> 52:06.418
* Bluuuue *

52:06.459 --> 52:09.004
Ruby is 16.
Oh, my gosh.

52:09.045 --> 52:10.296
[ Laughs ]

52:10.338 --> 52:12.674
She obviously reminds me
of a Patsy Cline.

52:12.716 --> 52:15.885
Something there
is very spectacular.

52:15.927 --> 52:18.638
And I think
she's got such a future.

52:18.680 --> 52:21.891
She's unique in a way
that country music needs.

52:21.933 --> 52:23.852
* Me *

52:23.893 --> 52:26.062
[ Laughter ]

52:26.104 --> 52:29.274
That is so gutsy.
I admire you so much.

52:29.315 --> 52:30.650
I got goosebumps.
Thank you.

52:30.692 --> 52:33.194
As the mega mentor...
Yes, ma'am.

52:33.236 --> 52:36.281
...I say amen because we need
this kind of music.
Double amen.

52:36.322 --> 52:37.991
Make sure
that your low notes

52:38.033 --> 52:40.160
are just as healthy
as your high ones.

52:40.201 --> 52:42.704
* Over you *

52:42.746 --> 52:44.080
She's the master of that.

52:44.122 --> 52:46.708
When the band starts,
you get in character.

52:46.750 --> 52:50.337
Don't do anything that makes us
think that you're happy.

52:50.378 --> 52:52.130
I'm sorry.
You make me happy, Reba.

52:52.172 --> 52:53.423
[ Laughter ]

52:53.465 --> 52:55.383
I mean, this was good
on another song.

52:55.425 --> 52:56.551
I liked it, actually.

52:56.593 --> 52:58.720
But it took her
out of the song.

52:58.762 --> 53:00.597
Mom used to get mad at me
for doing stuff like that,

53:00.638 --> 53:02.849
and that's why I did it.
See?

53:02.891 --> 53:05.018
She's an ornery kid.
Nuh-uh.

53:05.060 --> 53:07.062
I tell you what,
can we do it again?

53:07.103 --> 53:08.855
And I want to see
the difference.

53:08.897 --> 53:10.065
Okay, Mom.

53:10.106 --> 53:11.691
[ Laughter ]

53:11.733 --> 53:14.027
Reba: Ruby is bringing back
old-school country.

53:14.069 --> 53:18.114
* Now that it's over *
So much better.
Love it.

53:18.156 --> 53:19.824
Wynonna and I were
just thrilled to death

53:19.866 --> 53:22.869
to hear that she's got
a great break in her voice.

53:22.911 --> 53:26.581
And she's totally different
from anybody in the competition.

53:26.623 --> 53:29.918
[ Laughter ]
You are so proud of yourself.

53:29.959 --> 53:31.252
[ Laughter ]

53:31.294 --> 53:32.504
It's gonna be
real interesting

53:32.545 --> 53:34.798
to see who rises above

53:34.839 --> 53:37.509
because they're all three
very great singers.

53:37.550 --> 53:39.636
They're different
in their own right.

53:39.678 --> 53:41.846
I got the best team ever.

53:41.888 --> 53:44.849
That's gonna be hard to decide
between those three ladies.

I can tell when somebody's
really, really wanting it.

01:06:41.459 --> 01:06:43.211
Like, it means
everything to her.

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:47.674
* In the real world *

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:48.883

01:06:49.884 --> 01:06:51.094
Wow!

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:55.682
I'm blown away by your voice
and your conviction.

01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:58.518
But I would just say,
just try to relax a little bit

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.855
because it's just too much
of a good thing all at once.

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:04.524
And as a mom, I know
we're giving it all we've got

01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:06.985
in that two minutes,
'cause that's what we do.

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:08.945
We show up
and we show out.
Yeah.

01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:12.574
But then there's also a time
to relax and enjoy your journey.

01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:13.700
Yeah, have fun.

01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:15.952
Paramore is
so alternative,

01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:18.955
and you're singing it
in a pop way, right?

01:07:18.997 --> 01:07:20.415
With the runs
and everything.

01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:22.584
It's distracting me
from the lyric.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:25.045
To me, I would be like
* Ain't it fun? *

01:07:25.086 --> 01:07:28.089
Like it's sarcastic.
"This sucks, actually."

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.215
You know what I mean?

01:07:29.257 --> 01:07:30.383
You got this.

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:32.469
CORii -- she's a powerhouse,

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.554
and she's going to push me

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:37.307
to come swinging even harder,
you know?

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:40.852
Well, what did you choose
to sing for us?

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:43.688
I chose "Leave (Get Out)"
by JoJo.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:47.233
I'm R&B, but it has, like,
a pop flair to it, as well.

01:07:47.275 --> 01:07:50.320
* I've been waiting all day
for ya, bae *

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:51.738
This song is about

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.406
telling somebody
to get out of your life.

01:07:53.448 --> 01:07:56.159
They're not treating you the way
that you deserve to be treated.

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.452
I can relate to it

01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.496
because I've been through
the same thing.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:01.748
* You said that you would
treat me right *

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:05.585
* But you was
just a waste of time *

01:08:05.627 --> 01:08:07.754
I was in that relationship
four years.

01:08:07.796 --> 01:08:10.298
I wanted what I saw
for us so bad,

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.718
but it was breaking me,
so I had to let go.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.595
It was tough,
but look at me now.

But it wasn't
until the chorus

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:29.943
that you really started
to lock in.
Okay.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:32.821
Get real in a way
that's not about performing,

01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:34.322
and let me hear it.
Yeah.

01:08:34.364 --> 01:08:36.950
I want it to be so believable
that I feel every word

01:08:36.991 --> 01:08:39.494
that you're saying
because you're honest.

01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:41.162
What if you weren't
on "The Voice"

01:08:41.204 --> 01:08:43.081
and you were singing it
in your bedroom?

* Won't you come and sit
and talk to me? *
Whoo!

She technically can do
so much with her voice.

01:09:02.017 --> 01:09:05.562
She has a big range,
she has this realness to her,

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:07.147

a really cool performance.

Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Well done.

01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:18.158
CORii and Kara,
they're nailing it.

01:09:18.199 --> 01:09:19.701
I mean, they're up
in the rafters.

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:21.119
They're doing all the runs,

01:09:21.161 --> 01:09:22.996
so there is an intimidating
factor in that.

01:09:23.038 --> 01:09:25.123
But I really want
to get to playoffs.

01:09:25.165 --> 01:09:28.585

sing my booty off.

This one was always one
that I loved.

Just looking at the verse
with being 13 and everything.

01:09:36.092 --> 01:09:38.928
I was the 13-year-old
with the bad haircut,

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.848
but I'm also,
when I'm not here,

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:45.393
I'm a singing teacher back home,
and I teach a lot of girls.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.854
My youngest student's
4 years old...
I love that.

01:09:47.896 --> 01:09:50.482
...and my oldest
female student's in her 50s.

Oh, my goodness.

* This is for all... *

01:09:52.817 --> 01:09:54.027
From the time they're kids,

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:55.820
I grow these relationships
with them.

01:09:55.862 --> 01:09:57.822
They come with --
they're wanting advice,

01:09:57.864 --> 01:09:59.949
and I'm trying to help them
accomplish their dreams.

of them every single time.

I really hope they can hear
my heart when I'm singing it

for us to connect.

the full-deal package.

She really turns into a star
when she's singing.

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:30.897
Performance-wise,
she's really learned a lot

01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:33.108
about not taking it too far,

01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:35.610
and she feels it
when she's singing it.

01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:38.238
I think she has
so much potential.

So, there's not a girl
on the planet

01:10:46.162 --> 01:10:49.374
that doesn't feel like
she's still 13, in a way.

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:51.751
I'm going to ask you to
at least once or twice

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:52.919
look into the camera,

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:54.295
because you're
singing an anthem,

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.923
so you're singing
to every girl out there.

are going to relate

in the way
that she writes her songs.

01:11:04.973 --> 01:11:07.225
It shows with stadiums
full of girls that are like,

01:11:07.267 --> 01:11:09.519
"I relate to you
and how you're saying this,

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:10.979
your view," right?
Mm-hmm.

towards talking to the women

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:15.775

She just has such great
instincts and stuff,

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:19.779

and this is a country song.

CORii, you have
such a powerful voice.

01:19:07.706 --> 01:19:10.375
I was a little bit concerned
about that song

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:13.169
not matching
your voice perfectly,

01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:14.963
but you still sounded great.

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:17.215
It was so good.
Thank you.

01:19:17.257 --> 01:19:20.343
Kara, you really look
like a star up there.

And I just believe you
as an artist.

on this stage.

And, Kristen,
you're so good.

Even just the little twang
you had in your voice,

01:19:31.062 --> 01:19:32.313
it sounded amazing.

01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:33.523
There was a moment
where it felt like

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:34.691
you lost your way
a little bit.

like...

I got a little emotional.

[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Yeah.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.489
Whatever the case, like, you're
clearly such a good singer.

Y'all look great

was perfect for your voice,

and I'm very proud of you.

you're a great singer.

You look wonderful.
Your stage presence is great.

And, Kristen,
I loved your song.

01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:06.806
I just think it's hard
to sing soft after singing loud.

01:20:06.848 --> 01:20:10.894
So, that was a very gutsy choice
on your part.

01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:12.312
I think I'd pick CORii.

The way you told the story,
as well, it was brilliant.

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:21.237
And the way you played around
the backing vocals

01:20:21.279 --> 01:20:22.614
on the track
were phenomenal.

01:20:22.655 --> 01:20:24.199
And, Kristen, I've really
felt that emotion.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.909
I could see you singing to
this little girl down the front,

01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:28.411
and it was really like,
"This one's for the girls."

01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:30.038
It was a proper message.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.415
I honestly didn't care that
you lost the plot afterwards.

I've always been
a fan of Kristen,

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.335

with Kristen.

in a bad way.

in a good way.

your attitude.

that second half vocally

01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:10.120
wasn't your sweet,
sweet spot,

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.872
but I didn't care,
because if I were a girl,

01:21:12.914 --> 01:21:14.624
like, I would relate
to you right there.

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:16.501
So, this makes it
really difficult,

01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:20.296

are so good at being you.

how do I choose one you?
