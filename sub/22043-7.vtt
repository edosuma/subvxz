WEBVTT

00:00.190 --> 00:02.730
(dramatic music)

00:02.730 --> 00:04.760
- [Gordon] I'm in the beautiful
lakeside town of Chelan,

00:04.760 --> 00:06.480
Washington, to help a husband

00:06.480 --> 00:08.610
and wife repair their bad reputation.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.580
- They have built walls around themselves.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.620
They are absolutely no
part of this community.

00:12.620 --> 00:13.670
- [Gordon] They don't know the difference

00:13.670 --> 00:14.840
between right and wrong.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.911
- [Brent] There's no such
thing as a fresh burger.

00:16.911 --> 00:17.744
- What?

00:17.744 --> 00:18.690
- [Gordon] And they are so stubborn.

00:18.690 --> 00:21.110
- You don't even know the fucking story.

00:21.110 --> 00:23.110
- It'll be a challenge
to get through to them.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.287
All you've done since I've
arrived here is lie to me.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.683
- And I totally fucking
disagree with that.

00:33.503 --> 00:36.086
(gentle music)

00:45.900 --> 00:47.010
- [Gordon] Chelan, Washington,

00:47.010 --> 00:49.280
surrounded by the gorgeous
Cascade Mountains,

00:49.280 --> 00:50.890
situated on Lake Chelan.

00:50.890 --> 00:53.680
This small town is home
to the Lakeview Hotel

00:53.680 --> 00:55.930
and B.C. MacDonald's restaurant.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.740
Owners Brent and Afni Macdonald

00:57.740 --> 01:00.720
have been in business
here for over 15 years.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.580
- We bought the hotel in 2000.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.850
We came into town and a lot of the locals,

01:05.850 --> 01:07.860
they really didn't want to see us make it.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.460
They figured, they won't be here long.

01:10.460 --> 01:13.220
Well, I let them know
that we are going nowhere.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.623
You're stuck with us.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.330
The Lakeview Hotel is adults only.

01:17.330 --> 01:20.070
We think that it's the
nicest hotel probably

01:20.070 --> 01:21.310
in the state of Washington.

01:21.310 --> 01:22.780
- We have a great place here,

01:22.780 --> 01:24.560
B.C. MacDonald's, Lakeview Hotel.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.660
But business is really slow.

01:26.660 --> 01:30.473
We're losing probably
30,000 a month, easy.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.877
- The financial situation
here at the hotel

01:33.877 --> 01:35.970
and the restaurant, it is tough.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.760
And this year, it's extremely tough,

01:38.760 --> 01:42.430
because we had wildfires in
the area, and quite honestly,

01:42.430 --> 01:44.380
that's what kind of has broke the bank.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.070
- The majority of the reason

01:49.070 --> 01:50.970
why there's no consistent business here

01:50.970 --> 01:53.460
is Brent and Afni's reputation.

01:53.460 --> 01:55.620
- I'm talking, I am talking!

01:55.620 --> 01:57.930
- Customers come in and
she'll say, you hurry up,

01:57.930 --> 01:59.020
you go sit down!

01:59.020 --> 02:00.760
I training, you sit down.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.898
We'll be with you in a minute!

02:01.898 --> 02:03.340
(bell dinging)

02:03.340 --> 02:05.930
- I'm the best employer in town.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.530
I think I'm easy to work with.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.650
Just be quiet, will you, please?

02:10.650 --> 02:13.110
You know, I don't know why
people don't like to be here.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.170
- If you wanna keep money flowing through,

02:15.170 --> 02:16.430
the locals need to like you.

02:16.430 --> 02:19.130
And, you know, if you have a
bad attitude towards the locals

02:19.130 --> 02:21.530
or other customers, they're
not gonna come back.

02:24.430 --> 02:26.210
- Get out there and do a little dance.

02:26.210 --> 02:27.340
Come on.

02:27.340 --> 02:29.050
I know you used to pole dance.

02:29.050 --> 02:30.230
Get your ass out there.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.700
- I definitely get very embarrassed

02:31.700 --> 02:33.010
by some of the things he says.

02:33.010 --> 02:34.670
- I hope you got a lot of energy tonight,

02:34.670 --> 02:37.413
'cause, baby, this is Friday night.

02:37.413 --> 02:38.940
Friday night!

02:38.940 --> 02:40.570
- People are coming to a nice restaurant,

02:40.570 --> 02:42.630
they don't wanna hear dirty jokes

02:42.630 --> 02:45.230
and cussing and everything like that.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.380
- Brent does not like to be told anything.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.610
You could tell him the sky's
blue, and it's gonna upset him.

02:50.610 --> 02:52.580
- I think the people are
lucky to work for us.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.563
I think I got a great management style.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.340
- Chelan is a beautiful town.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.913
The opportunity is there.

03:02.990 --> 03:04.580
We just get overlooked

03:04.580 --> 03:06.853
because of Brent and Afni's reputation.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.410
- All of our money that we
have made in the last 30 years

03:11.410 --> 03:14.610
has been sunk into this business,

03:14.610 --> 03:18.770
and we have so much
invested, we cannot stop.

03:18.770 --> 03:20.873
Because otherwise, we're done.

03:24.424 --> 03:27.007
(lively music)

03:30.266 --> 03:33.099
(engine rumbling)

03:34.785 --> 03:36.117
- Valet parking.

03:36.117 --> 03:37.455
Where's the valet guy?

03:37.455 --> 03:40.186
(playful music)

03:40.186 --> 03:42.197
- Think that's Mr. Ramsey?

03:42.197 --> 03:43.780
- Could be.
- Okay.

03:46.357 --> 03:47.949
- So.

03:47.949 --> 03:49.032
- That's him.

03:49.883 --> 03:52.917
- [Gordon] That did say
valet parking there, right?

03:52.917 --> 03:54.540
Yeah, it's not my eyesight.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.016
- Maybe he thinks he has the wrong place.

03:57.016 --> 03:59.599
(horn hooting)

04:05.880 --> 04:08.029
- [Gordon] Valet park it is not.

04:08.029 --> 04:09.589
Oh, wow.

04:09.589 --> 04:10.689
- Rock and roll, baby.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.870
- The best breakfast,
lunch and dinner in town.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.178
- Come on in!
- Hello.

04:16.178 --> 04:17.012
- Come on in.

04:17.012 --> 04:18.170
- How are you both?
- Good afternoon,

04:18.170 --> 04:19.390
Chef Ramsey.
- Wow,

04:19.390 --> 04:20.740
what a gorgeous drive that was.

04:20.740 --> 04:21.857
- Oh, thank you.

04:21.857 --> 04:22.690
- How are you?

04:22.690 --> 04:24.240
Oh, ladies first, I'm so sorry.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.440
- I totally understand that.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.273
- Good to see you.

04:26.273 --> 04:28.940
The valet parking on strike?

04:28.940 --> 04:30.480
- It is this time of year.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.710
- So it's temporary valet parking?

04:31.710 --> 04:32.930
And what do I do with my car?

04:32.930 --> 04:34.020
'Cause you kept the sign there.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.980
- I'll park it for you, how about that?

04:35.980 --> 04:37.374
- Wow.

04:37.374 --> 04:38.207
When was the last time we dusted in here?

04:38.207 --> 04:39.563
It's a bit dusty up there.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.460
What's that up there?

04:42.460 --> 04:44.360
Something is growing up there.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.090
Can you see that, or is it me?

04:46.090 --> 04:46.923
- I can see it.

04:46.923 --> 04:47.950
- [Gordon] Wow.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.704
- Yeah, it's right there.

04:49.704 --> 04:50.584
- I know you're both wearing glasses.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.252
I just wanna make sure you can see it.

04:52.252 --> 04:53.180
Wow.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.800
- It's not real easy to see for me.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.144
- [Gordon] How do you get that down?

04:56.144 --> 04:57.415
- Well, usually we use that-

04:57.415 --> 04:58.248
- We have a long pole.

04:58.248 --> 04:59.081
- Long pole.
- Duster.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.414
- And where is the pole?

05:00.414 --> 05:01.533
- [Brent] It's right in the back here.

05:01.533 --> 05:02.963
- I'll be right back.

05:05.130 --> 05:05.963
- [Gordon] Wow.

05:05.963 --> 05:07.820
- Well, now you've made
everything dusty down here.

05:07.820 --> 05:08.850
- I've made it dusty?

05:08.850 --> 05:10.223
No, you haven't cleaned it.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.600
Supposing that falls on a customer's head,

05:13.600 --> 05:14.500
what would you do?

05:15.710 --> 05:17.532
- I don't think that it will, actually.

05:17.532 --> 05:18.365
- Oh, you don't think it will?

05:18.365 --> 05:20.230
- No, no, it's been up
there for about six months,

05:20.230 --> 05:22.210
it seems to be growing, actually.

05:22.210 --> 05:24.140
- That is disgusting.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.360
Brent, shame on you.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.220
- [Brent] I know.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.420
- Wow, and what's in here?

05:30.101 --> 05:31.817
More dust over here, Brent.

05:31.817 --> 05:33.470
- [Brent] Oh, is there more?

05:33.470 --> 05:35.370
- You must have missed that spot too.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.150
There's a big, long creepy
crawly hanging down there.

05:38.150 --> 05:39.020
- [Brent] Yes, I see that.

05:39.020 --> 05:39.853
- [Gordon] Wow.

05:39.853 --> 05:40.970
- [Brent] We've been closed
for the last three weeks.

05:40.970 --> 05:43.060
When it's so slow this time of
the year, we go on a holiday.

05:43.060 --> 05:45.160
- And when you close,
do you normally clean

05:45.160 --> 05:45.993
before you close?

05:45.993 --> 05:47.093
Or do you come back dirty?

05:48.450 --> 05:50.800
- Come back the way it is and...

05:50.800 --> 05:52.550
- [Gordon] Wow, look at that up there.

05:52.550 --> 05:55.550
- [Brent] We're living in a
very dusty environment here.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.590
- That's bullshit.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.570
- Yeah, okay.

05:57.570 --> 05:58.880
- Come on, seriously?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.600
This is the mountain, clean air, I mean-

06:00.600 --> 06:02.676
- Well, that's all true, yeah.

06:02.676 --> 06:03.509
- For you.

06:03.509 --> 06:04.379
- Oh, there you go.

06:04.379 --> 06:05.709
Thank you for that.

06:05.709 --> 06:06.542
- [Afni] No problem.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.660
- I didn't expect to clean
as I checked in, you know?

06:08.660 --> 06:09.830
Oh, my God, there you go.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.580
They are gross, right?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.070
- Don't mess it up too much.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.620
It's all gonna come down.

06:14.620 --> 06:18.211
- Well, how long are you
thinking of keeping it up there?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.310
Oh, shit.

06:19.310 --> 06:20.850
- We might as well do them
all while we're at it.

06:20.850 --> 06:22.029
- [Gordon] We might as well do them all.

06:22.029 --> 06:22.862
- Yeah.

06:22.862 --> 06:25.178
- It's not funny, I've gotta
get this thing out of here.

06:25.178 --> 06:27.550
(dramatic music)

06:27.550 --> 06:29.850
Holy shit, look at that.

06:31.298 --> 06:32.730
- Jesus.
- God dammit, Afni!

06:32.730 --> 06:35.370
- Why didn't you get to that?
- Well, I'm trying.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.320
- And how long have you had this place?

06:38.509 --> 06:39.342
- 15.

06:39.342 --> 06:40.310
- 15 years?
- 15 years.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.690
- Was that the last time it was cleaned?

06:42.690 --> 06:44.650
- It was clean, you're just good.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.444
- You've got a great
eye, I can tell you that.

06:46.444 --> 06:48.760
- I've done lots of things on arrival,

06:48.760 --> 06:51.860
but I've never quite cleaned
shit like that from a ceiling.

06:51.860 --> 06:52.693
Can I give that back to you?

06:52.693 --> 06:53.613
- [Afni] Yeah, I'll do that, okay?

06:53.613 --> 06:54.690
- Right.
- Yes, thank you.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.310
- What's going on here?

06:56.310 --> 06:58.510
On the front door, you've got 40 flavours.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.343
- [Brent] Yes.

06:59.343 --> 07:00.176
- Sorry, no samples.

07:00.176 --> 07:02.540
- Yes, when we're really, really busy,

07:02.540 --> 07:06.183
we have a line that goes out
the door, and if one person

07:07.563 --> 07:11.490
asks for a sample, they
will all ask for a sample.

07:11.490 --> 07:12.600
- And how do you think

07:12.600 --> 07:16.070
all those yoghourt
franchises entice business?

07:16.070 --> 07:17.760
They offer samples.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.360
So they speculate to accumulate.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.660
Sorry, no samples, sorry, no samples.

07:22.660 --> 07:25.200
Who comes up with all these stupid rules?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.033
- [Brent] Probably myself.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.200
- Man, you like kicking
the crap out of the locals,

07:28.200 --> 07:29.033
don't you?

07:29.033 --> 07:30.450
- [Brent] Yes.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.510
- So I take it we're not gonna
get, oh, there's another one.

07:34.510 --> 07:35.343
- [Brent] Yes.

07:35.343 --> 07:36.640
- There's me thinking that's a flavour.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.220
So how long ago did this close?

07:38.220 --> 07:39.720
Oh, my God, look how dusty that it.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.750
- It's not closed.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.720
- This is not closed?

07:41.720 --> 07:42.710
- [Brent] No, it's not.

07:42.710 --> 07:43.624
- Stop.

07:43.624 --> 07:44.457
- It is not.

07:44.457 --> 07:45.813
It looks like it's closed, oh, no.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.220
Bloody hell.

07:48.220 --> 07:51.000
Where's the stick gone, please?

07:51.000 --> 07:51.833
Oh, my God.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.370
This is monstrous.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.100
This is like a cobweb on steroids.

07:55.100 --> 07:55.990
Where's the stick gone?

07:55.990 --> 07:56.890
- She's getting it.

07:56.890 --> 07:59.500
- So why did you close for three weeks?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.820
- I went on a holiday.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.610
- Wow, and where did you go?

08:02.610 --> 08:04.200
- Mexico.
- Wow.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.193
- Did you enjoy Mexico?

08:05.193 --> 08:08.230
- Yeah, we really enjoyed being together.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.410
- She only came for a week.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.933
She gives me a week by myself.

08:13.542 --> 08:16.210
- Say that again, you go
on holiday on your own.

08:16.210 --> 08:17.043
- I do.

08:17.043 --> 08:17.876
- Rest for a week,

08:17.876 --> 08:18.709
and then your wife comes
for the second week.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.260
- My wife and daughter meet
me for the second week.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.750
- Would you not like to
go for two weeks holiday?

08:21.750 --> 08:23.560
- Well, I would love
to, if I have a chance.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.713
- Oh, I see.

08:26.780 --> 08:27.613
Right.

08:28.670 --> 08:29.813
I just wanna get this thing down here.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.720
Have you seen the size of this one?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.360
- Yup.
- Holy crap!

08:33.360 --> 08:34.600
- Is that a keeper?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.332
- That, look at that.

08:37.190 --> 08:40.110
This is above an ice cream parlour.

08:40.110 --> 08:42.299
If we turn that on, it's gonna spin dust.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.133
- [Brent] Hopefully it won't.

08:43.133 --> 08:44.562
- Look at that.

08:44.562 --> 08:45.629
- Yeah, that is...

08:45.629 --> 08:46.797
- [Gordon] Fucking hell.

08:46.797 --> 08:48.776
(stick tapping)

08:48.776 --> 08:49.980
What?

08:49.980 --> 08:52.260
- I think you're doing awesome, actually.

08:52.260 --> 08:56.140
I think that we should possibly
hire him, really, you know?

08:56.140 --> 08:58.343
- I'm glad that I'm hired to clean.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.730
- Yeah, that's...

09:00.730 --> 09:02.500
- [Gordon] Wow, do I have
to take this to my room?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.600
- [Brent] It may be a good idea.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.980
- Are you serious?
- No.

09:04.980 --> 09:07.320
- Let's go, no dust, right?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.153
Oh, shit.

09:08.153 --> 09:09.220
Whilst I'm up here, look.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.053
- Oh, come on.

09:10.053 --> 09:11.440
- No, but look at these ones
here on the top of that.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.273
- [Brent] We'll get it.

09:12.273 --> 09:14.040
- Oh, now you'll get it.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.020
Well, it's obvious that
you haven't done it before,

09:16.020 --> 09:17.820
let's go.
- Well, you know?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.280
- [Gordon] How many
rooms do you have here?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.113
- [Brent] 12.

09:20.113 --> 09:20.950
- [Gordon] 12, wow.

09:20.950 --> 09:22.957
- [Brent] This room
probably isn't for you.

09:22.957 --> 09:24.830
But we're gonna give it to you anyway.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.690
- What do you mean by that?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.350
- [Brent] It's for people
that haven't been laid

09:27.350 --> 09:28.880
for a while, quite honestly.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.790
- Say that again, sorry?

09:30.790 --> 09:32.140
People that haven't been laid?

09:32.140 --> 09:34.090
- [Brent] Laid, laid.

09:34.090 --> 09:34.930
- As in?

09:34.930 --> 09:36.440
- [Brent] As in.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.753
- What's that got to do with
me checking into this room?

09:40.250 --> 09:41.811
Wow,

09:41.811 --> 09:45.360
and this is a room for those
who haven't been laid recently?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.030
You don't talk like that to guests.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.370
- Well, this is an awesome room.

09:48.370 --> 09:51.070
It offers the best view that we have

09:51.070 --> 09:52.783
of the river part of Lake Chelan.

09:52.783 --> 09:53.616
- [Gordon] Wow, wow.

09:53.616 --> 09:55.770
- [Brent] It has a
stacked stone fireplace.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.040
Awesome ceiling.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.097
I think they're 15 feet, and...

09:59.097 --> 10:01.370
- [Gordon] That's an
awesome, dusty ceiling,

10:01.370 --> 10:02.682
see those beams?

10:02.682 --> 10:03.810
- [Brent] Yeah, I see those.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.010
- [Gordon] Wow, man, what
is it with dust around here?

10:06.010 --> 10:08.790
- Well, as I said, we're in a dusty area.

10:08.790 --> 10:11.490
- [Gordon] Apart from the
dust, the rooms are gorgeous.

10:11.490 --> 10:14.880
- Yes, these are the
air conditioning units.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.713
- Where's that?

10:15.713 --> 10:17.070
- So you don't have that
funky thing down here

10:17.070 --> 10:18.230
that cries motel.

10:18.230 --> 10:19.597
- I thought it was the TV.

10:19.597 --> 10:21.730
- No, it's air conditioning.

10:21.730 --> 10:23.180
We programme it for both AC

10:23.180 --> 10:24.403
or heat.
- Right,

10:24.403 --> 10:26.550
so how do I adjust the temperature?

10:26.550 --> 10:28.203
- [Brent] You don't, they're pre-set.

10:28.203 --> 10:30.300
It's set at 68 degrees.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.050
- [Gordon] Wow, why's it set like that?

10:32.050 --> 10:34.200
- [Brent] I keep the remote controls,

10:34.200 --> 10:37.210
because I absolutely know
that they will get screwed up

10:37.210 --> 10:38.810
if I leave them up here in the room.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.390
- You don't give samples, you
don't let me keep the remotes,

10:41.390 --> 10:43.647
and you don't let me bring
the temperature up or down.

10:43.647 --> 10:46.010
It's not really the get laid room, is it?

10:46.010 --> 10:47.210
- That's up to you.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.670
- Wow, you're setting the bar.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.520
You're telling me what I
can and what I can't do.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.353
Weird, very weird.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.880
Look how dusty this is as well.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.980
How do I open that up?

10:57.303 --> 10:58.136
I see you got all these fancy gadgets.

10:58.136 --> 10:59.010
- [Brent] Would you like me to open it?

10:59.010 --> 11:00.363
- Yes, please, thank you.

11:01.630 --> 11:04.550
Wow, when was the last
time they were cleaned?

11:04.550 --> 11:06.663
- [Brent] That gets
cleaned about twice a year.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.940
- Would you mind if I just
make it three times this year?

11:11.940 --> 11:14.153
- [Brent] Yeah, I think
that sounds great, actually.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.940
- So the air conditioning
unit you control,

11:17.940 --> 11:20.850
they have to breathe in
this shit at the night.

11:20.850 --> 11:21.890
Are you bullshitting me?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.680
- No, I'm not bullshitting you.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.060
- Right, can you-

11:25.060 --> 11:25.893
- [Brent] I will take that.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.110
- You mind, I've got no
interest in breathing your dust.

11:29.110 --> 11:30.960
Okay, I'm gonna unpack and
I'll be down in five minutes.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.793
- Okay.
- Please.

11:31.793 --> 11:33.033
- All right.
- Wow.

11:35.509 --> 11:36.342
(Gordon sighing)

11:36.342 --> 11:37.580
- Honestly, look at that.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.873
It's terrible.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.258
Disgusting.

11:42.258 --> 11:45.341
(lighthearted music)

11:46.520 --> 11:47.560
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.178
- Man, the dust when I walked in.

11:50.178 --> 11:51.250
What the hell's going on there?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.280
- That's bizarre.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.200
- How long have you been here?

11:54.200 --> 11:55.033
- [Shelli] A month.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.610
- [Gordon] So you're a
new kid on the block?

11:56.610 --> 11:57.570
- I am, yes.

11:57.570 --> 11:59.750
- Wow, do they go through a lot of staff?

11:59.750 --> 12:00.583
- I think so.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.350
There is some that have been
here for years, but actually,

12:03.350 --> 12:04.680
the ones that were here, the cooks,

12:04.680 --> 12:07.540
they have recently left and...

12:07.540 --> 12:09.940
- I mean, how would you
describe them as bosses?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.770
- Different than any I've ever had.

12:13.770 --> 12:16.525
- Yeah, I'll say, anyway, let's order.

12:16.525 --> 12:17.710
Obviously, I was gonna
have a glass of wine.

12:17.710 --> 12:18.950
Hoping to get something local

12:18.950 --> 12:21.060
having just driven through
those amazing vineyards,

12:21.060 --> 12:23.270
but there's nothing local here.

12:23.270 --> 12:24.103
- No.

12:24.103 --> 12:26.950
- I mean, New Zealand sauvignon blanc.

12:26.950 --> 12:27.790
How weird.

12:27.790 --> 12:28.880
What would you recommend for lunch?

12:28.880 --> 12:29.980
What's the soup today?

12:29.980 --> 12:31.220
- The soup is a minestrone.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.430
- Oh, that's good.

12:32.430 --> 12:34.030
B.C.'s Bacon Burger,

12:34.030 --> 12:34.950
yeah?
- Okay.

12:34.950 --> 12:37.205
- Let's do a pizza, as well.

12:37.205 --> 12:38.038
Homemade, right?

12:38.038 --> 12:40.560
- Sorry, actually we don't
do the pizzas any longer.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.900
I don't know why the
page is not taken out.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.290
- Wow, okay, anything else that's not on?

12:45.290 --> 12:49.380
- We are out of the pork stir
fry, and we do not have chilli.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.830
- No chilli.

12:50.830 --> 12:51.980
Wow.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.203
Let's do a prime rib with
that, as well, shall we?

12:55.670 --> 12:57.363
- I believe we're out of prime rib.

12:58.474 --> 12:59.560
- We're out of a lot of things.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.460
- I believe so, yeah.

13:00.460 --> 13:04.440
The turkey ciabatta dip
is usually a good one.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.620
- Let's do a turkey dip.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.240
- Okay.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.730
- Hold on a minute, breaking news.

13:08.730 --> 13:11.773
B.C.'s "Soon To Be Famous" Teriyaki Steak.

13:11.773 --> 13:13.470
What the fuck does that mean?

13:13.470 --> 13:15.020
When someone says soon to be famous,

13:15.020 --> 13:16.450
who writes this shit on the menu?

13:16.450 --> 13:18.543
Soon to be famous, why
would that be on the menu?

13:18.543 --> 13:20.640
- I think we should try it.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.085
- Let's go, I think we're done.

13:22.085 --> 13:23.510
- Okay.
- Yeah.

13:23.510 --> 13:24.533
- Sure, be right back.

13:24.533 --> 13:27.033
- [Gordon] Thank you, darling.

13:27.983 --> 13:29.950
- Hey, do you need help?

13:29.950 --> 13:31.420
- [Gordon] Minestrone soup, right?

13:31.420 --> 13:32.260
- Correct.

13:32.260 --> 13:36.733
- [Gordon] Excellent, oh, wow.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.240
Wow, that doesn't even taste homemade.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.223
- It's frozen.

13:41.381 --> 13:42.548
- It's frozen?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.960
- Yes.
- Frozen minestrone soup?

13:44.960 --> 13:46.381
- [Shelli] Yeah, okay.

13:46.381 --> 13:48.309
- [Gordon] This is terrible.

13:48.309 --> 13:50.220
(dramatic music)

13:50.220 --> 13:52.710
- [Shelli] We've got
the B.C. Bacon Burger.

13:52.710 --> 13:53.720
- Wow.

13:53.720 --> 13:54.988
Jeez.

13:54.988 --> 13:56.080
Look how thin that is.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.980
My onion ring's thicker than my patty.

13:59.810 --> 14:01.580
Where are they from?

14:01.580 --> 14:03.400
- I'll find out that answer.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.790
On the hamburgers,

14:04.790 --> 14:07.070
it says on the menu certified Angus beef.

14:07.070 --> 14:07.903
Where do we get that?

14:07.903 --> 14:09.537
Are they fresh or frozen?

14:09.537 --> 14:11.410
- No, we always come packaged frozen.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.963
- 12.95.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.860
That's overcooked and the patty's bland.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.417
It actually tastes frozen.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.491
But please tell me-

14:20.491 --> 14:22.403
- It does come frozen.

14:23.770 --> 14:26.050
- So it says fresh,

14:26.050 --> 14:27.817
and it's not anywhere near.

14:27.817 --> 14:29.033
$13 for that?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.230
- He's brutal.

14:32.230 --> 14:34.200
- [Brent] I think the food
coming out is very good.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.260
- [Shelli] This is the turkey melt.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.270
- [Gordon] Thank you,
and what's this here?

14:38.270 --> 14:40.430
- [Shelli] That is the
broth for the turkey.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.480
- [Gordon] The broth?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.390
(plate clinking)

14:44.390 --> 14:46.790
- [Shelli] If you wanna
dip your sandwich in it.

14:47.773 --> 14:49.837
- Holy shit, what is that in there?

14:49.837 --> 14:50.987
Just have a little sip.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.787
- Wow.

14:55.787 --> 14:56.620
- It's so salty.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.510
- Yes, it is.
- It's so bad.

14:58.510 --> 14:59.830
- [Shelli] It's salty and bitter.

14:59.830 --> 15:00.663
- Jesus.

15:00.663 --> 15:02.780
- Here, you wanna taste this, actually.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.140
He had me taste it.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.650
- Oh, yeah, it's really salty.

15:05.650 --> 15:06.850
- Really salty?
- Yeah.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.158
- Holy shit.

15:09.158 --> 15:09.991
(Gordon coughing)

15:09.991 --> 15:11.680
- This here is the
teriyaki chicken burger.

15:12.710 --> 15:16.853
- The nearly famous burger, what the fuck?

15:16.853 --> 15:18.450
What is that?

15:18.450 --> 15:19.873
What's he doused in?

15:20.780 --> 15:22.653
Teriyaki over cheese.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.260
Nearly famous.

15:26.260 --> 15:30.296
This is about to be famous
to send me to the bathroom.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.129
- Yeah.

15:31.129 --> 15:32.600
- I mean, I'm not even gonna go there.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.520
Nope, I'll just have a coffee, thank you.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.710
- You bet.

15:36.710 --> 15:39.393
- Right, let's get reviewing.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.650
Wow, headline, do not go here.

15:43.650 --> 15:45.870
If you want mediocre, over-priced food,

15:45.870 --> 15:47.010
this is the place for you.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.530
Unfortunately, not my dig.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.802
Bloody hell.

15:49.802 --> 15:51.880
Wow, this is terrible.

15:51.880 --> 15:52.713
This is terrible.

15:52.713 --> 15:53.953
- [Shelli] Oh, it's awful.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.260
- I mean, look at the headlines.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.430
What an odd place.

15:56.430 --> 15:59.520
The owner bad-mouthed another
local place at our table.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.330
Do not go here, run, run, run far away.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.730
Horrible service, terrible
food and stupid expensive.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.130
The owners are jerks who are rude

16:06.130 --> 16:07.720
and don't support their staff.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.750
They don't welcome kids, no
wonder this place is empty.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.293
They're that bad?

16:12.293 --> 16:13.126
- It is.

16:13.126 --> 16:14.160
It's very awkward.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.770
You know, Afni says they
don't listen to this.

16:16.770 --> 16:19.000
- These are customers,
they're all negative.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.133
And psst, FYI, no samples allowed.

16:23.120 --> 16:23.953
- [Shelli] That's right.

16:23.953 --> 16:25.402
- Tight bastard.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.960
Is he really stingy?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.394
- Absolutely.
- Is he?

16:28.394 --> 16:29.233
- Yeah.

16:29.233 --> 16:31.510
- And the lack of, you know, children.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.093
- And they do have a teenage daughter.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.750
- So they have a teenage daughter,

16:34.750 --> 16:35.790
but they don't welcome kids?

16:35.790 --> 16:36.623
- Yes.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.610
- He goes on holiday for a
week on his own, suns himself,

16:40.610 --> 16:41.900
gets nice and bronzed,

16:41.900 --> 16:43.570
then she joins him for the second week.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.093
But he wants a week on his own?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.760
It's just like, what
are you talking about?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.351
- I had not heard that.

16:49.351 --> 16:50.380
(Gordon whistling)

16:50.380 --> 16:51.420
- What a creep.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.820
- Yeah.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.540
- If I did that to my wife,
she would kick me in the nuts.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.730
- Yes.

16:56.730 --> 16:57.780
- I'm at a loss.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.053
This place is depressing,

17:00.130 --> 17:02.556
and I'd like to get the owners down here.

17:02.556 --> 17:03.670
Let's just have a little
debrief, shall we?

17:03.670 --> 17:05.180
- Okay, you bet.
- Thank you.

17:05.180 --> 17:06.960
- [Gordon] Wow, Jesus Christ.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.260
- He want us?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.290
- [Shelli] He does, yeah.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.740
- Let's go.
- It's okay.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.750
- It's fine with me.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.891
- Don't say anything, don't make like fun.

17:14.891 --> 17:15.723
- [Brent] No, no, no.

17:15.723 --> 17:16.557
- He thinks that it's

17:16.557 --> 17:17.390
not funny.
- Stop it.

17:21.829 --> 17:22.930
- I'm at a loss.

17:22.930 --> 17:26.520
The biggest kick in the balls
for me is that on the menu,

17:26.520 --> 17:31.520
it states, homemade, fresh
daily changing soup of the day.

17:31.670 --> 17:35.720
Your soup of the day, Brent, is frozen.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.200
Can you make minestrone soup?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.033
- Yes.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.400
- How much does it cost to make a litre?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.370
- A couple bucks.

17:41.370 --> 17:42.850
- Tell the owner.

17:42.850 --> 17:45.140
And you have the nearly famous burger.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.840
I'd like to congratulate you,

17:46.840 --> 17:50.630
because it's now famous as the
most disgusting bit of shit

17:50.630 --> 17:52.660
between a bun I've ever seen.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.190
You have a slice of red onion

17:54.190 --> 17:55.540
that's thicker than your patty.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.620
It was frozen.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.270
And you're charging 13.95 for it.

17:59.270 --> 18:01.453
I don't know how low we can go.

18:02.550 --> 18:04.830
The list, everything's from New Zealand.

18:04.830 --> 18:07.000
There's not even a local wine on here.

18:07.000 --> 18:07.990
- Well...

18:07.990 --> 18:09.110
- Give it to me, then.

18:09.110 --> 18:10.810
- Oh, I'll give it you.

18:10.810 --> 18:14.430
Most of these wineries
all opened up restaurants.

18:14.430 --> 18:15.740
They're our competitors.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.340
- [Gordon] So you can't
support the local vineyards?

18:17.340 --> 18:18.360
- Yeah, well...

18:20.260 --> 18:21.513
- I came in here to help.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.770
I'm laughed at, lied to.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.373
I'm fed frozen food.

18:28.450 --> 18:31.723
As an owner, you two can't be that gone.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.200
Otherwise, I'm gonna go.

18:36.205 --> 18:39.122
(orchestral music)

18:42.110 --> 18:44.320
Right before dinner, I had a
chance to catch up with Teddy,

18:44.320 --> 18:47.370
the manager, so I could
understand his perspective

18:47.370 --> 18:49.560
of what Afni and Brent are like as owners.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.410
- Inappropriate things are commonly said.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.530
His personality has a lot to do with it.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.840
It's, you know, really common
that he'll make you feel

18:55.840 --> 18:59.060
that this is the best place
and you're lucky to be here.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.630
- Their behaviour as
bosses is unacceptable.

19:01.630 --> 19:02.650
Wow, wow, wow.

19:02.650 --> 19:03.830
Clearly in denial.

19:03.830 --> 19:04.860
I appreciate the insight.

19:04.860 --> 19:05.718
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well done.

19:05.718 --> 19:06.560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.517
- I'll see you in there, yes?

19:07.517 --> 19:08.350
- [Teddy] Definitely.

19:08.350 --> 19:09.760
- [Gordon] And I want to
observe what they're like

19:09.760 --> 19:11.851
during an evening at the Lakeview.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.601
(dramatic music)

19:15.850 --> 19:17.441
- So you have a key to the room.

19:17.441 --> 19:18.274
- I can't wait.
- But let's hope

19:18.274 --> 19:19.130
that it's ready.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.970
- Couple things that we're not offering,

19:20.970 --> 19:23.593
no Chilean sea bass, and no pizza.

19:23.593 --> 19:24.550
- Did you say no pizza?

19:24.550 --> 19:27.060
- [Teddy] No pizza, no sea bass.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.403
- [Customer] Very disappointing.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.790
- Fucking hell.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.483
Frozen, frozen, frozen.

19:34.150 --> 19:35.880
Wow, not even wrapped.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.110
Where are the burgers?

19:37.110 --> 19:39.010
I mean, it just doesn't
look anything like a burger.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.680
And when it's processed like
that, it's stamped and pressed.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.220
You can just tell.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.290
Frozen food.

19:44.290 --> 19:45.490
Wow.

19:45.490 --> 19:47.220
Brent, come with me.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.270
How's the fettuccine?

19:49.134 --> 19:51.190
- [Customer] It's okay, not the best.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.090
- Damn, I'm sorry.

19:53.034 --> 19:54.220
The burgers?

19:54.220 --> 19:56.610
A burger cooked here locally,

19:56.610 --> 19:59.350
would you expect that
to be frozen or fresh?

19:59.350 --> 20:00.600
- Fresh.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.050
- The burger is not frozen.

20:02.050 --> 20:04.460
It's the patties and
everything come in frozen

20:04.460 --> 20:05.610
and then they're thawed out

20:05.610 --> 20:07.250
like most people do it.
- Oh, you thawed it it out?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.150
So it's not frozen then?

20:09.150 --> 20:10.600
- [Brent] It comes in frozen.

20:12.130 --> 20:12.963
Yeah.

20:12.963 --> 20:13.796
- [Gordon] You thaw it out and that,

20:13.796 --> 20:15.720
to your customers, is not a frozen burger?

20:17.461 --> 20:18.294
- What?
- Well.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.680
- Stay there, let me
just show you something.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.347
(playful music)

20:27.730 --> 20:28.680
- We're waiting for him to come back.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.330
He's gonna ream me on something.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.163
Oh boy,

20:32.163 --> 20:33.157
here we go.
- Sorry.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.960
- So there's your burgers.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.220
- [Afni] It's frozen.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.030
- Thank you, now, your
husband said it wasn't.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.800
- No, what do you mean?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.680
No, it's frozen.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.619
Of course, I never said that it wasn't.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.360
We thaw it out here, it comes in frozen.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.470
- Yeah.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.330
- It's still a frozen burger.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.290
- There's no such thing as a fresh burger,

20:53.290 --> 20:55.539
at least here in Eastern Washington.

20:55.539 --> 20:56.372
- What?

20:56.372 --> 20:58.020
- [Brent] We cannot get
fresh, there's no fresh.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.740
You find me the burger.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.000
- Come with me.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.270
Good evening, welcome.

21:02.270 --> 21:03.240
Please come in out of the cold.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.073
Are you joining for-
- Dinner?

21:04.073 --> 21:04.906
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:04.906 --> 21:06.240
- Quick question, do you love a burger?

21:06.240 --> 21:07.180
- Yeah, I love a burger.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.660
- Madam?
- Yes.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.390
- Would you expect them to
be made fresh here or frozen?

21:11.390 --> 21:12.990
- Fresh.
- Fresh.

21:12.990 --> 21:14.960
- [Gordon] You gonna tell
them, or should I tell them?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.150
- Fresh all the way!

21:16.150 --> 21:17.460
- No, should we tell them the truth?

21:17.460 --> 21:18.881
I mean, that's what we want to do.

21:18.881 --> 21:23.130
- Well, our burgers come in
frozen and we thaw them out.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.790
- But thawing them out doesn't make them

21:25.790 --> 21:27.272
fresh.
- Fresh.

21:27.272 --> 21:28.562
- [Gordon] Thank you, appreciate it.

21:28.562 --> 21:29.590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.360
- Thanks for coming, you guys.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.912
- Welcome, ladies.
- Hey, folks.

21:32.912 --> 21:34.340
- How are you?

21:34.340 --> 21:35.640
- Quick question.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.390
Coming out for dinner, would
you expect a frozen burger

21:37.390 --> 21:39.027
to be served here tonight, or a fresh one?

21:39.027 --> 21:40.297
- Fresh.
- Fresh.

21:40.297 --> 21:42.368
- Are you gonna tell them
or should I tell them?

21:42.368 --> 21:43.539
- I'll let you tell them.

21:43.539 --> 21:44.500
- [Gordon] Oh, come on, you own the place.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.070
- Well, all of our beef
that we get in, burgers,

21:48.070 --> 21:49.730
it comes in frozen.

21:49.730 --> 21:51.890
Our burgers, and we thaw them out.

21:51.890 --> 21:54.539
- Which in his mind,
convinces him, it's fresh.

21:54.539 --> 21:56.410
Does that make it sound any better?

21:56.410 --> 21:57.490
- No.
- No.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.050
- Thank you.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.710
- We're still glad to have
you, thank you, you bet.

22:01.710 --> 22:02.633
- Oh, my God.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.040
After Brent tried to convince me

22:05.040 --> 22:07.330
that there were no fresh burgers in town.

22:07.330 --> 22:08.210
- I almost cry.

22:08.210 --> 22:10.060
- It's okay, you did good, honey.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.270
I'm proud of you.

22:11.270 --> 22:12.970
- [Gordon] I walked
directly across the street

22:12.970 --> 22:14.120
and ordered one.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.174
So that's the lamb burger?
- This is the burger.

22:16.174 --> 22:18.841
(intense music)

22:21.370 --> 22:22.445
- Nice to see you.

22:22.445 --> 22:23.390
Coming into a restaurant like this,

22:23.390 --> 22:26.320
would you expect your burgers
to be fresh or frozen?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.153
- Fresh.

22:27.153 --> 22:29.967
- The burgers come in
frozen and we thaw them out.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.020
That's the story.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.210
- Thank you.

22:34.210 --> 22:36.283
So that is a lamb burger.

22:37.350 --> 22:38.550
Fresh.

22:38.550 --> 22:41.530
I'm getting sick to death of
this denial, denial, denial.

22:41.530 --> 22:42.660
You've been making up bullshit

22:42.660 --> 22:43.585
all fucking day.
- Oh, that's bullshit,

22:43.585 --> 22:44.902
I have not.
- Yes, you have.

22:44.902 --> 22:45.735
- No.

22:45.735 --> 22:47.960
- All your staff have
the same thing to say.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.830
Passive-aggressive, condescending,

22:49.830 --> 22:51.513
inappropriate, and stubborn.

22:52.450 --> 22:53.660
- No, absolutely not.

22:53.660 --> 22:55.821
- [Gordon] The staff,
the way you treat them.

22:55.821 --> 22:56.654
- What?

22:56.654 --> 22:57.767
- There you go again,

22:57.767 --> 23:00.070
denial, denial, denial.
- No, no, no, no no.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.870
- You're just scared
about employing a team

23:01.870 --> 23:03.160
who's gonna tell you the truth.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.520
- That is bullshit.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.353
That is not true.

23:05.353 --> 23:06.240
- [Gordon] 'Cause you don't
like them confronting you

23:06.240 --> 23:07.380
with the truth.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.277
You'll fire them.

23:08.277 --> 23:09.770
- No, I haven't fired anybody.

23:09.770 --> 23:12.410
- I heard that you fired your son.

23:12.410 --> 23:13.423
- Oh, shit.

23:15.950 --> 23:18.020
You don't even know the fucking story.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.169
He was having some issues,
Gordon and I told him-

23:20.169 --> 23:21.440
- I was aware of the alcohol
problem, I was aware of that.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.730
- Right, I was trying to save his life.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.050
- Yeah, my brother's a drug addict.

23:25.050 --> 23:28.010
We put him in rehab seven
times unsuccessfully.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.160
I don't give up on him.

23:30.090 --> 23:31.390
But what I'm more concerned about

23:31.390 --> 23:33.880
is that nothing's affecting you.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.770
It's like, we're doing great.

23:35.770 --> 23:38.113
- And generally, the
place runs quite well.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.083
- Oh, my God.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.723
Come with me, just you and I.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.590
Is this a joke for you?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.510
Can you give us two minutes, please?

23:46.510 --> 23:47.490
Are you fucking around?

23:47.490 --> 23:48.323
- [Brent] No, I'm not fucking around.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.710
- Are you trying to pull
the wool over my eyes?

23:50.710 --> 23:51.610
- Oh, hell no.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.090
- You know the business is dwindling.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.820
So you've got all these rules.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.920
No fucking samples.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.030
No fucking kids.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.140
This place is thriving with families.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.460
- We really don't wanna
have crying kids here.

24:04.460 --> 24:07.180
I just would like to have a quiet getaway

24:07.180 --> 24:11.710
for our honeymooners and
birthdays and anniversaries.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.040
- A honeymoon venture, they come down

24:13.040 --> 24:16.190
and have a romantic dinner
and eat a frozen burger?

24:16.190 --> 24:17.460
Come on.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.360
This place is haemorrhaging money.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.990
'Cause you're caught in a web.

24:20.990 --> 24:24.233
Delusional, stubborn, old-fashioned,

24:25.432 --> 24:26.823
and fucking pompous.

24:27.830 --> 24:28.733
- Anything else?

24:30.140 --> 24:31.200
- It's just a joke for you, isn't it?

24:31.200 --> 24:35.293
- No, next time I'm gonna
know to do a little dusting.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.420
- Wow, a little dusting.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.913
Fuck me, how deluded.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.665
(dramatic music)

24:48.240 --> 24:49.510
During dinner service,

24:49.510 --> 24:51.950
I decided to do some
investigating in the rooms.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.560
Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.880
And after what I found,

24:54.880 --> 24:58.000
I gathered the hotel guests
along with Afni and Brent.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.830
Hey, guys, come through, please.

24:59.830 --> 25:02.223
Just very quickly, glasses on.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.560
There we are, come through.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.290
If you could just stand over here.

25:06.290 --> 25:09.123
Pillow left-hand side, pillow number one.

25:11.070 --> 25:11.980
Can you see that?

25:11.980 --> 25:13.010
- [Brent] I can't see a darn thing.

25:13.010 --> 25:13.843
- [Gordon] You can't see?

25:13.843 --> 25:15.540
Maybe Afni.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.373
- Yeah.

25:16.373 --> 25:18.820
- [Gordon] Explain to Brent what this is.

25:18.820 --> 25:20.040
- [Afni] Spot.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.480
- [Gordon] Spot, you don't know?

25:21.480 --> 25:22.808
- [Afni] Yeah, spot.

25:22.808 --> 25:25.250
- [Gordon] Maybe this one
will be a little bit clearer.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.083
Blood.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.260
- [Afni] There we go.

25:29.260 --> 25:30.310
- [Guest] Well, that's disgusting.

25:30.310 --> 25:31.980
- Right, Afni?
- Yes?

25:31.980 --> 25:34.348
- [Gordon] Brent can't see anything.

25:34.348 --> 25:36.990
- [Brent] Go ahead, well,
I see that, of course.

25:36.990 --> 25:37.823
- [Gordon] Okay.

25:37.823 --> 25:39.960
- Do you see that right here?
- I see it.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.590
- This is the worrying bit.

25:42.590 --> 25:43.423
These are the

25:44.420 --> 25:47.300
duvets that have been on these beds.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.510
- [Brent] That was just
washed one week ago.

25:49.510 --> 25:50.343
Every single one of them.

25:50.343 --> 25:51.230
- Absolute rubbish.

25:51.230 --> 25:53.210
And look at this!

25:53.210 --> 25:54.290
I mean, these customers,

25:54.290 --> 25:55.990
they're the ones you're
taking the money from.

25:55.990 --> 25:58.270
Don't you dare tell me
that was washed a week ago.

25:58.270 --> 25:59.160
- [Brent] One week ago,

25:59.160 --> 26:00.200
I have the bill.
- Stop!

26:00.200 --> 26:01.033
- We have-

26:01.033 --> 26:02.040
- You cannot be serious!

26:02.040 --> 26:04.550
- We are serious, it
was done and that's it.

26:04.550 --> 26:05.383
We're not gonna

26:05.383 --> 26:06.261
sit here and-
- I swear, I got the receipt.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.240
- [Gordon] Right, but that is not clean.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.650
- Oh, that's bullshit.
- Yeah, it is bullshit!

26:10.650 --> 26:12.200
- And this...

26:12.200 --> 26:13.440
Go on.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.280
- [Brent] I see that, but one
week ago, that was cleaned.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.970
- I'm done with this bullshit.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.440
This is from years!

26:19.440 --> 26:20.670
- We did 13 of them

26:20.670 --> 26:21.653
one week ago.
- Stop lying!

26:21.653 --> 26:23.480
- [Brent] Then they're not
cleaning them properly.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.693
- Stop, just for once
today, fucking lying!

26:28.216 --> 26:30.883
(intense music)

26:34.250 --> 26:36.300
And look at this.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.150
I mean, that is not cleaned.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.020
- [Brent] That was just
washed one week ago.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.080
- Stop, just for once today, lying!

26:43.080 --> 26:44.290
Just stay there two seconds.

26:44.290 --> 26:45.583
What the fuck.

26:47.403 --> 26:50.810
Did you have any idea
you're sleeping in that?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.830
- No, not at all.

26:52.830 --> 26:53.663
- I wish you can't see

26:53.663 --> 26:55.730
that kind of stuff.
- I don't wanna sleep in that.

26:55.730 --> 26:56.580
- [Gordon] Brent?

26:59.400 --> 27:00.370
- I see that.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.210
- I want an explanation,

27:02.210 --> 27:05.910
'cause all you've done since
I've arrived here is lie to me.

27:05.910 --> 27:07.990
Lied to me, lied to your staff,

27:07.990 --> 27:11.410
and I am not gonna allow
you to lie to the customers.

27:11.410 --> 27:14.000
- And I totally fucking
disagree with that too.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.502
I have not said one lie to you.

27:16.502 --> 27:17.980
- Yes, you fucking well have.
- I'm not gonna go for that.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.312
- Yes, you have.
- No.

27:19.312 --> 27:20.145
- That is fucking bullshit
- You've been fucking lying

27:20.145 --> 27:21.230
to me all day.

27:21.230 --> 27:22.300
- It's not true.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.750
- You're convinced that
thawed food is fresh food.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.570
You're robbing them of their cash.

27:28.570 --> 27:31.090
You're telling me this
was cleaned a week ago.

27:31.090 --> 27:33.760
Let me ask you question in
front of your customers,

27:33.760 --> 27:34.910
would you sleep on that?

27:34.910 --> 27:35.880
- No.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.040
- So why do you expect them to?

27:38.040 --> 27:39.100
Would you sleep on that?

27:39.100 --> 27:40.150
- No.

27:40.150 --> 27:41.810
- Not an apology.

27:41.810 --> 27:42.643
Nothing.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.323
I'd like to apologise, I'm appalled.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.433
I'm disgusted.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.363
I've had enough.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.570
Anything you'd like to say?

27:54.570 --> 27:57.650
- The pillows like this, I apologise.

27:57.650 --> 28:00.223
- Can I have a word with him
on my own, would you mind?

28:03.810 --> 28:05.520
These guests are hours away

28:05.520 --> 28:08.210
from putting their heads on your pillows.

28:08.210 --> 28:09.823
Blood-stained pillows.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.810
Semen-stained duvet covers,

28:13.810 --> 28:15.530
and sweat

28:15.530 --> 28:17.710
accumulated over years.

28:17.710 --> 28:19.360
- [Brent] I can see that, Gordon.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.210
- I am struggling.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.710
I'm struggling with your
husband that's in denial.

28:26.710 --> 28:28.400
I'm struggling with his arrogance.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.370
And I'm struggling with his blatant lies.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.470
I'm not here to butt heads with a liar.

28:32.470 --> 28:35.323
I'm here to help turn
this business around.

28:36.938 --> 28:37.771
(Afni sighing)

28:37.771 --> 28:39.770
Afni, you can talk to me.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.283
Are you worried about Brent?

28:42.740 --> 28:45.470
- He's my husband, yes, I am.

28:45.470 --> 28:46.653
He's my life.

28:48.150 --> 28:49.783
We have a daughter together.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.640
- Does your daughter feel this at home?

28:54.930 --> 28:56.000
- Yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.250
- And he fell out with his son.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.673
He fired his son.

29:01.658 --> 29:02.491
- Yeah.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.823
- Does that still bother him?

29:04.830 --> 29:06.083
Is that what it is?

29:07.240 --> 29:08.290
- He's still his son.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.327
- Of course he's still his son.

29:12.327 --> 29:13.450
- He still care about him.

29:13.450 --> 29:16.050
- It doesn't sound like
he's caring about him.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.253
The guy was drinking.

29:18.360 --> 29:21.363
He needed help, and
then he got rid of him.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.830
Is that what's bothering him?

29:25.830 --> 29:27.670
Is that why he's in denial?

29:27.670 --> 29:30.510
I need Brent to take his guard down.

29:30.510 --> 29:33.283
Something inside here is bothering him.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.210
I don't know if it's the
financial debt, the pressure.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.210
Is it his son?

29:38.210 --> 29:39.450
I don't know.

29:39.450 --> 29:40.723
I can't get in.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.543
I wanna talk to his son.

29:46.330 --> 29:47.423
How can I get a hold of him?

29:47.423 --> 29:48.940
- I've got his number.

29:48.940 --> 29:50.378
- Thank you.

29:50.378 --> 29:53.960
Afni, you're the only hope I've got.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.315
Can we work together?

29:55.315 --> 29:56.148
- Yeah.

29:56.148 --> 29:58.794
- And can we get him to open up?

29:58.794 --> 29:59.710
- Okay.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.140
- And tomorrow morning, I want the truth

30:02.140 --> 30:03.693
and nothing but the truth.

30:04.556 --> 30:05.389
- Okay.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.940
- I really needed to
break through to Brent

30:16.940 --> 30:18.890
and to see why he is so stubborn.

30:18.890 --> 30:21.300
So my team and I attempted
to get a hold of his son

30:21.300 --> 30:22.950
to meet me at the hotel.

30:22.950 --> 30:24.510
But we were unsuccessful.

30:24.510 --> 30:27.993
Now, it's up to me to try
to get through to Brent.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.890
Let's take a seat at the bar.

30:31.890 --> 30:34.580
I've gotta get through to
you why you're so stubborn.

30:34.580 --> 30:37.503
You got fucked off last night
'cause I mentioned your son.

30:39.370 --> 30:40.833
Why did that hit a nerve?

30:41.740 --> 30:44.480
- You know, we just had a
breakdown in the relationship

30:44.480 --> 30:46.573
when his mom remarried.

30:47.890 --> 30:50.610
She remarried the same
day the divorce was final.

30:50.610 --> 30:53.230
- So parting company with your son.

30:53.230 --> 30:55.823
You weren't even present
at your daughter's wedding.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.163
- I was not invited, I didn't
even know she got married.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.300
I was destroyed.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.150
Everybody want to see their daughter.

31:08.687 --> 31:10.487
- [Gordon] I've got three daughters.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.743
That's painful.

31:14.040 --> 31:18.080
- You know, when your kids tell you...

31:21.037 --> 31:21.870
I don't know, Gordon.

31:21.870 --> 31:23.173
- [Gordon] Tell you what?

31:23.173 --> 31:24.006
- Well...

31:25.700 --> 31:27.573
I have three grandkids.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.087
I haven't even seen two of 'em.

31:35.076 --> 31:35.909
You know what?

31:35.909 --> 31:37.750
You know, I am stubborn.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.800
Maybe I'm stubborn, but
when you get shut off

31:40.800 --> 31:42.740
and then their mom died.

31:42.740 --> 31:44.710
I thought, wow, maybe this
is gonna be my chance.

31:44.710 --> 31:46.870
Maybe they're gonna come to me.

31:46.870 --> 31:50.770
But my son just drinks too God damn much.

31:50.770 --> 31:54.400
- But, but, hey, you're
still their father.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.340
You are still their dad.

31:56.340 --> 31:57.671
- I know it.

31:57.671 --> 31:59.570
- You can't go around with

32:02.160 --> 32:03.553
that anger.

32:03.553 --> 32:05.823
- I've been waiting
for them to come to me.

32:06.940 --> 32:07.830
Instead of the other.

32:07.830 --> 32:09.240
- That's never gonna happen.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.218
There's not enough time.

32:10.218 --> 32:13.560
- Well, that's my proudness
and my stubbornness, you know?

32:13.560 --> 32:14.500
- You have to change your ways,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.460
and you have to start
becoming a lot more generous

32:17.460 --> 32:20.987
as an owner, as a father
responsible for three kids.

32:20.987 --> 32:23.330
And I'm not here to fix your family.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.163
I'd love you to.

32:24.163 --> 32:25.763
I would so fucking love you to.

32:26.910 --> 32:29.400
And just you calling
them, making an effort,

32:29.400 --> 32:30.580
they need to see the change.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.540
But you need to embrace that.

32:32.540 --> 32:33.373
- [Brent] I agree.

32:33.373 --> 32:34.810
- There's too much at stake.

32:34.810 --> 32:36.490
Reach out to those kids.

32:36.490 --> 32:39.290
You've got to bring those barriers down

32:39.290 --> 32:40.240
and you've gotta open up.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.280
And somewhere in there,
there's the friendly,

32:43.280 --> 32:46.815
comforting, supportive,
you know, astute Brent.

32:46.815 --> 32:47.648
We've gotta get back there.

32:47.648 --> 32:48.481
- Okay.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.570
- Brent and Afni's bad reputation

32:53.570 --> 32:56.190
within the town comes as no surprise.

32:56.190 --> 32:57.730
You got a picture there?

32:57.730 --> 33:00.050
Great, give me two minutes, please, okay?

33:00.050 --> 33:02.480
I've gathered local business
owners to show Brent

33:02.480 --> 33:05.760
and Afni the issues that
they don't realise they have.

33:05.760 --> 33:06.593
Good morning.

33:06.593 --> 33:07.426
- [Business Owners] Good morning!

33:07.426 --> 33:08.259
- How are we?

33:08.259 --> 33:09.092
- Good!
- Great!

33:09.092 --> 33:10.870
- First of all, I just wanna
say a big thank you for coming.

33:10.870 --> 33:13.680
You guys are the pillars of the community.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.140
You have businesses and you are very proud

33:17.140 --> 33:18.630
of what you've built here.

33:18.630 --> 33:19.740
And I've been struggling

33:19.740 --> 33:22.520
trying to get through to Brent.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.760
He's in denial.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.060
- I feel like Brent is an undertaker.

33:27.060 --> 33:28.900
Those people that are working for him,

33:28.900 --> 33:32.153
there aren't many that have
very good things to say.

33:33.753 --> 33:35.970
- That's ridiculous.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.730
- I had a friend that used
to work here, at B.C.'s,

33:38.730 --> 33:41.157
and she had a customer
that had a steak dinner

33:41.157 --> 33:43.260
and a baked potato, it was all great.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.630
And he wanted to take it with him,

33:44.630 --> 33:46.790
so she took it in the back
and set it on the counter

33:46.790 --> 33:50.640
and went to get a to-go
container, and Afni

33:51.650 --> 33:53.160
scraped it into the garbage.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.380
And she said, my customer
kind of wanted to take that.

33:56.380 --> 34:00.150
And she watched Afni
grab the baked potato,

34:00.150 --> 34:02.622
wipe it off, and grab the steak.

34:02.622 --> 34:03.455
- Out of the trash?

34:03.455 --> 34:05.412
- [Woman] And she made her
give that to the customer.

34:05.412 --> 34:06.245
- No!

34:06.245 --> 34:08.670
(business owners groaning)

34:08.670 --> 34:10.719
- No free samples on the ice creams.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.918
How hard is it to give somebody
a little plastic spoon?

34:13.918 --> 34:16.139
(business owners laughing)

34:16.139 --> 34:17.530
- What do they give back to the town?

34:17.530 --> 34:20.010
- They are absolutely no
part of this community.

34:20.010 --> 34:22.080
They have built walls around themselves

34:22.080 --> 34:25.850
and you need to take care of
each other in the off season.

34:25.850 --> 34:27.570
It's locals taking care of locals.

34:27.570 --> 34:29.980
- You know, I will say,
with the fires, you know,

34:29.980 --> 34:31.540
this whole town came together

34:31.540 --> 34:35.000
and I don't think I can
remember them offering help

34:35.000 --> 34:36.350
in any way.

34:36.350 --> 34:39.380
It was a crisis that
everybody found a need,

34:39.380 --> 34:40.880
and everybody helped.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.949
- [Gordon] Yeah, except them.

34:41.949 --> 34:42.783
- Except them.

34:42.783 --> 34:44.213
- But that's the spirit
of Chelan, I think,

34:44.213 --> 34:45.739
is what we're getting at.

34:45.739 --> 34:49.210
We share tractors, we share,
you know, from vineyard work,

34:49.210 --> 34:51.650
some of us have restaurants,
so we share employees.

34:51.650 --> 34:52.713
- He's oblivious.

34:54.949 --> 34:56.179
How come there's no wine

34:57.030 --> 34:59.350
from this amazing region on their list?

34:59.350 --> 35:01.320
- When we first started our winery,

35:01.320 --> 35:05.110
his excuse was that the
wineries have restaurants

35:05.110 --> 35:07.990
that compete with his restaurant.

35:07.990 --> 35:08.823
- In addition to that,

35:08.823 --> 35:11.570
it would be a shame if there
was just one good place

35:11.570 --> 35:12.830
in town to go to.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.570
We want tourists to come here

35:14.570 --> 35:16.820
and have a great time everywhere they go.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.423
So if he does well, we'll all do well.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.650
- I really appreciate the feedback.

35:22.650 --> 35:25.540
But I want you to help me get through

35:25.540 --> 35:28.540
to them on another level now,
because I'm gonna go get them.

35:30.946 --> 35:32.746
And we're gonna tackle this head on.

35:33.790 --> 35:36.082
Give me two minutes, thank you so much.

35:36.082 --> 35:37.120
- You wanna go?

35:37.120 --> 35:39.060
It's really, really hard to take it.

35:39.060 --> 35:39.893
- Let's go.

35:39.893 --> 35:42.180
- Because we try really hard.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.320
It just shocked me.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.153
Wow.

35:45.983 --> 35:47.460
- Hi.
- Hi, folks.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.313
- These are, in my mind,

35:50.570 --> 35:51.840
even more important than the customers,

35:51.840 --> 35:53.743
because you guys should be bonding.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.210
Clearly, you're not.

35:57.660 --> 35:59.910
Why's it taken so long?

35:59.910 --> 36:03.433
- Sometimes you need somebody
just to slap your face.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.793
- We were in a comfort zone somewhat.

36:10.220 --> 36:13.780
And used to the way we
did everything, you know,

36:13.780 --> 36:16.990
for a lot of years, and
it needs to be changed.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.443
Maybe we banked on the location too much.

36:20.570 --> 36:22.560
There's a lot of things we've done wrong.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.140
- [Gordon] They're desperate
to see you do well.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.110
Anything to say?

36:25.110 --> 36:27.793
- There can never be too many fun,

36:28.680 --> 36:30.440
good places in town.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.510
We always want somewhere to go and relax

36:33.510 --> 36:34.900
and enjoy ourselves.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.983
- I think we all want
you back on our radar.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.570
- All of this has been
a wake-up call for us.

36:40.570 --> 36:44.330
This is part of the reason why
we asked Chef Ramsey to come,

36:44.330 --> 36:45.610
to help us.

36:45.610 --> 36:48.595
We're listening, we heard
everything that you had to say,

36:48.595 --> 36:52.350
and we are gonna try to
do much, much better.

36:52.350 --> 36:53.660
We're hearing you.

36:53.660 --> 36:57.290
I don't think that I knew
how the business community

36:57.290 --> 36:58.670
was connected.

36:58.670 --> 37:01.570
That everybody is feeding
off of each other.

37:01.570 --> 37:04.810
We have to realise that, to
be a part of this connection,

37:04.810 --> 37:05.883
we have to change.

37:07.965 --> 37:10.510
(upbeat music)

37:10.510 --> 37:12.550
- [Gordon] With Brent and
Afni committing to change,

37:12.550 --> 37:15.020
my team moved forward,
getting rid of all the dust

37:15.020 --> 37:16.430
and cobwebs.

37:16.430 --> 37:19.110
We furnished all the rooms
with brand new bedding,

37:19.110 --> 37:22.890
but the biggest change was
overhauling the ice cream parlour.

37:22.890 --> 37:23.723
Off you go.

37:23.723 --> 37:24.701
Ladies, welcome.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.785
(Afni gasping)

37:26.785 --> 37:27.765
- [Afni] My

37:27.765 --> 37:28.598
God!

37:29.624 --> 37:30.980
Holy

37:30.980 --> 37:31.813
moly!

37:31.813 --> 37:32.912
- Wow!

37:32.912 --> 37:34.310
Unbelievable.

37:34.310 --> 37:35.890
- Unbelievable!

37:35.890 --> 37:37.720
- [Gordon] This is what I call a parlour.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.440
You had a dreadful space here.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.820
- [Afni] Yes, oh, my God.

37:40.820 --> 37:44.120
- [Gordon] Now, it's turned
into something magical.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.130
- You think that there's any chance

37:45.130 --> 37:47.130
that I could get a sample?

37:47.130 --> 37:50.003
- We will be throwing
samples out everywhere.

37:51.249 --> 37:54.332
- [Brent] This is way
beyond our expectation.

37:54.332 --> 37:57.020
(gentle music)

37:57.020 --> 37:59.430
- Given the importance
of the local wineries,

37:59.430 --> 38:00.900
I brought in sommelier, Dave Foss.

38:00.900 --> 38:01.840
- How are you?

38:01.840 --> 38:04.080
- [Gordon] Who repaired the
bad reputations with the locals

38:04.080 --> 38:05.860
that Brent and Afni had.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.061
- You're gonna need to
nurture those relationships.

38:08.061 --> 38:08.894
- Right.

38:08.894 --> 38:10.300
- [Gordon] And he created a brand new menu

38:10.300 --> 38:12.310
featuring all Washington wine.

38:12.310 --> 38:14.540
- You're no longer gonna have to say,

38:14.540 --> 38:16.882
sorry, I don't have any local wines.

38:16.882 --> 38:18.650
- And finally, to accompany all of this,

38:18.650 --> 38:20.550
I created a smaller, more exciting menu

38:20.550 --> 38:22.960
that features all fresh food.

38:22.960 --> 38:23.793
Dig in.

38:23.793 --> 38:24.940
Have a little taste.

38:24.940 --> 38:26.630
- [Afni] Oh, my God, this is so good.

38:26.630 --> 38:27.620
- [Shelli] It's delicious.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.320
- [Teddy] Oh, my gosh!

38:29.320 --> 38:31.270
- [Afni] Everything fresh and better.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.520
- [Brent] It's fantastic.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.640
- [Gordon] What I have
learned from this community

38:35.640 --> 38:37.720
is that local support is everything.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.610
And this town is willing to give Brent

38:39.610 --> 38:41.640
and Afni a second chance.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.780
- Hi, everybody, how are you today?

38:43.780 --> 38:44.613
- Good to see you guys.

38:44.613 --> 38:48.010
- Would you like to see my
new ice cream parlour here?

38:48.010 --> 38:49.660
- [Gordon] With all the new improvements,

38:49.660 --> 38:51.950
I'm hoping Brent and Afni
make a good impression

38:51.950 --> 38:53.861
for the people of Chelan.

38:53.861 --> 38:54.694
- [Woman] I actually brought you a list

38:54.694 --> 38:56.620
of a lot of the purveyors
that we work with.

38:56.620 --> 38:57.453
- [Brent] Cool.

38:57.453 --> 38:59.780
- [Afni] Oh, you wanna check in!

38:59.780 --> 39:01.363
How are you, guys?

39:02.570 --> 39:03.693
- [Gordon] The hotel is booked up.

39:03.693 --> 39:05.410
- [Guest] This is just gorgeous.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.110
- [Gordon] And the guests
will sleep well tonight

39:07.110 --> 39:10.460
in the brand new bedding
we've added to all the rooms.

39:10.460 --> 39:11.933
- All right.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.330
- I'm gonna try the farro salad.

39:13.330 --> 39:15.030
- [Gordon] There's a real
buzz about the new menu.

39:15.030 --> 39:15.863
- [Waitress] Order up!

39:15.863 --> 39:18.030
- [Gordon] And the kitchen is
easily executing the dishes.

39:18.030 --> 39:19.450
- A quiche,

39:19.450 --> 39:21.593
a chicken sandwich, and I got the salmon.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.113
- What we're trying to do

39:24.113 --> 39:26.770
is just focus on the local wineries.

39:26.770 --> 39:28.810
- [Gordon] With the help
of sommelier, Dave Foss,

39:28.810 --> 39:30.600
the customers are pleased
with the local selection

39:30.600 --> 39:33.270
of wines that they're
offering at B.C. MacDonald's.

39:33.270 --> 39:34.966
- You like that?
- It's really good.

39:34.966 --> 39:36.133
- [Dave] Yeah?

39:37.190 --> 39:39.040
- I'm always making a mess.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.070
That's the idea.

39:40.070 --> 39:41.610
- [Brent] I'm the official scooper.

39:41.610 --> 39:43.740
- [Gordon] The ice cream shop is a hit.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.620
And Brent is even happy
giving away samples.

39:46.620 --> 39:48.720
- If you drop it on the floor, you own it.

39:49.730 --> 39:50.690
- Brent.

39:50.690 --> 39:52.290
With everything a success,

39:52.290 --> 39:54.680
I'm hoping Brent makes
one important rule change

39:54.680 --> 39:55.780
with his hotel.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.870
Have you thought about what I
mentioned about the children?

39:57.870 --> 39:59.970
Regarding children in the hotel

39:59.970 --> 40:01.490
or are you still sticking
with no children?

40:01.490 --> 40:02.323
- You know what?

40:02.323 --> 40:03.893
I'm gonna stick to the adults only.

40:03.893 --> 40:04.726
- Adults only?

40:05.990 --> 40:07.090
Why?

40:07.090 --> 40:08.093
- Well, look,

40:08.988 --> 40:10.880
when you take two or three
or four children up there,

40:10.880 --> 40:12.010
and I'm gonna tell you,

40:12.010 --> 40:14.370
they'd wipe out the whole damn place.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.640
- What, the noise?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.523
- Noise, crying, whatever.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.460
Gum and

40:20.460 --> 40:23.900
pop, and, God forbid, samples
of ice cream, they will-

40:23.900 --> 40:25.820
- You have a young daughter.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.510
- I know, I'm talking three,
four, eight year olds.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.193
- Have you asked yourself
the consequences,

40:30.193 --> 40:31.340
what am I missing on turnover?

40:31.340 --> 40:32.173
Revenue?

40:32.173 --> 40:33.290
- We may miss a few,

40:33.290 --> 40:35.050
but I think we'd miss
a few on the other end

40:35.050 --> 40:38.070
if there were two or three
kids running down the hall.

40:38.070 --> 40:40.400
- But not every kid

40:40.400 --> 40:42.130
is that noisy.

40:42.130 --> 40:44.810
I mean, just try to be open
with maybe a couple rooms.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.610
- I will give it thought.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.560
That's a tough one.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.550
- I'm disappointed Brent
won't alter his rules

40:52.550 --> 40:54.750
about allowing kids at the hotel.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.860
But hopefully, after seeing
the success of the relaunch,

40:57.860 --> 40:59.140
he'll change his mind.

40:59.140 --> 41:00.560
Keep up the good work, yes?

41:00.560 --> 41:02.320
Brian, do not let him go back.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.153
- Absolutely not.

41:03.153 --> 41:04.670
- Okay, well done.

41:04.670 --> 41:05.503
Thank you.

41:06.710 --> 41:07.543
- [Afni] Are you leaving?

41:07.543 --> 41:08.580
- Yes, I am.

41:08.580 --> 41:11.530
Everybody now in this
town is rallying around

41:11.530 --> 41:12.640
for your success.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.473
- Yes.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.540
- So embrace it.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.830
Watching you stand behind that counter

41:16.830 --> 41:18.000
just giving samples out

41:18.000 --> 41:19.600
and seeing the delight on the kids' face,

41:19.600 --> 41:20.730
that was extraordinary.
- It's awesome.

41:20.730 --> 41:22.310
- [Gordon] Please, don't go back.

41:22.310 --> 41:23.233
Stay strong.

41:23.233 --> 41:24.066
- We will.
- Oh, yeah.

41:24.066 --> 41:26.438
- There's an amazing guy
underneath all those layers.

41:26.438 --> 41:27.271
- There is?

41:27.271 --> 41:28.770
- Yes, there is, there is.

41:28.770 --> 41:29.640
- Thank you.
- There is.

41:29.640 --> 41:30.870
- You can do this, okay?

41:30.870 --> 41:31.703
- [Brent] I can do it.

41:31.703 --> 41:32.933
- Yeah, take care.
- Thank you so much.

41:32.933 --> 41:34.766
- [Gordon] All right, look after him.

41:34.766 --> 41:35.599
- Thank you so much.

41:35.599 --> 41:37.420
- And he's gonna think about
getting some kids in here.

41:37.420 --> 41:38.783
- Okay.

41:38.783 --> 41:39.881
- They're not that bad.
- We're working on it.

41:39.881 --> 41:41.332
- [Afni] I'm serious.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.160
- Mr. Stubborn.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.190
Couple scoops of ice
cream goes a long way.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.630
- Oh, boy, it's really
gone down, hasn't it?

41:46.630 --> 41:48.305
Got any money in the till yet?

41:48.305 --> 41:49.345
Thank you!

41:49.345 --> 41:50.178
- Take care.

41:50.178 --> 41:51.343
- Good night.
- Okay, bye, bye.

41:57.439 --> 42:00.700
(bouncy music)

42:00.700 --> 42:02.140
- [Gordon] Despite my
help with the outreach

42:02.140 --> 42:02.990
or the community,

42:03.910 --> 42:06.193
Brent quickly reverted
back to his old ways,

42:07.160 --> 42:09.023
distancing himself from the locals.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.980
Much of the staff have left or been fired,

42:12.980 --> 42:15.410
and the hotel's reputation within the town

42:15.410 --> 42:17.160
has only gotten worse.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.787
- Fuck.

42:18.787 --> 42:19.720
I don't know.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.663
I don't know where in
the hell everybody's at.

42:56.967 --> 42:59.717
- [Child] One potato, two potato.
