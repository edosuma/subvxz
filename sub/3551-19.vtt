WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.073
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.073 --> 00:04.075
PAUL WAS SHOCKED
TO FIND FELICIA

00:04.075 --> 00:06.077
WAS BACK ON THE LANE.

00:06.077 --> 00:08.079
WELL, HELLO, PAUL.

00:08.079 --> 00:11.112
TOM'S NEW JOB CAME WITH PERKS.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.115
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO
ON A PRIVATE JET?

00:14.115 --> 00:15.686
(gasps) ANYTHING.

00:15.686 --> 00:17.688
A RELATIONSHIP WAS FORCED
TO END.

00:17.688 --> 00:20.191
WE ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS,
NOT YOU AND ME,

00:20.191 --> 00:22.523
AND NOT YOU AND GABY.
 YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR ME.

00:22.523 --> 00:27.128
I JUST DID.
 AND SUSAN GOT HER TRANSPLANT,
THANKS TO PAUL.

00:27.128 --> 00:30.201
I'M SURE AS I SIGN THE PAPERS,
THEY'LL BE CONTACTING YOU.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.707
(Mary Alice)
AFTER SUSAN DELFINO'S

00:36.707 --> 00:39.340
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT,
HER DOCTOR ORDERED HER

00:39.340 --> 00:41.342
TO ABSTAIN FROM SEX...

00:41.342 --> 00:43.043
FOR SIX WEEKS.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.045
(sighs)

00:45.045 --> 00:49.820
BUT WHAT THE DOCTOR COULDN'T
PREVENT SUSAN FROM DOING...

00:49.820 --> 00:52.683
WAS DREAMING ABOUT IT.

00:55.356 --> 01:00.591
THESE DREAMS WERE FILLED
WITH TORRID CARESSES...

01:02.093 --> 01:04.665
WITH PASSIONATE KISSES...

01:06.137 --> 01:10.101
(gasping)
 AND WITH SOFT CRIES OF ECSTASY.

01:10.101 --> 01:12.243
AHH.

01:12.243 --> 01:17.348
THE ONLY THING MISSING
FROM THESE DREAMS...

01:17.348 --> 01:19.079
WAS HER HUSBAND.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.581
(gasps)

01:20.581 --> 01:25.786
(breathes deeply)

01:25.786 --> 01:27.288
(gasps)

01:27.288 --> 01:29.120
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:29.120 --> 01:32.163
UH... YEAH, I JUST...

01:32.163 --> 01:33.464
HAD A DREAM.

01:33.464 --> 01:35.526
YEAH, I KNOW.

01:35.526 --> 01:38.199
YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

01:38.199 --> 01:41.402
WAS I SAYING SOMETHING?
WAS I TALKING?
 MORE LIKE MOANING.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.475
OH, MOANING! OH, GOD.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.877
YEAH, YOU MENTIONED HIM, TOO.
 (cries)

01:46.877 --> 01:49.580
OH, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
SO YOU HAD A SEX DREAM.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.613
IT'S NOT SURPRISING GIVEN
HOW LONG WE'VE HAD TO LAY OFF.
 (groans)

01:52.613 --> 01:54.815
TELL ME...
WHAT WERE WE DOING?

01:54.815 --> 01:55.816
UH... WE...

01:55.816 --> 01:58.149
HEY, MAYBE WE COULD
RECREATE IT

01:58.149 --> 02:00.751
WHEN WE END OUR DROUGHT
IN 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS,

02:00.751 --> 02:03.654
AND 35 MINUTES.
 WELL, UH...

02:03.654 --> 02:06.157
NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT WAS
SOME PRETTY KINKY STUFF.

02:06.157 --> 02:08.158
LIKE, DID WE--
DID WE DO THAT THING--

02:08.158 --> 02:11.232
THAT THING WE TALKED ABOUT?
 MIKE, IT WAS MY DREAM,
NOT YOURS.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.835
OH, GOD, I'M DESPERATE.
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME DETAILS?

02:14.835 --> 02:21.872
UH... OR I COULD SHOW YOU
IN 2 DAYS, 17 HOURS,

02:21.872 --> 02:24.745
AND 34 MINUTES.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.717
(sighs) THAT'LL WORK.

02:26.717 --> 02:29.220
I CAN'T WAIT. WE'LL SEND M.J.
TO MRS. McCLUSKEY'S,

02:29.220 --> 02:31.222
AND HAVE
THE WHOLE NIGHT TOGETHER.

02:31.222 --> 02:35.556
YES, SUSAN WAS HAVING DREAMS
ABOUT SEX.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.728
JUST THE TWO OF US.

02:37.728 --> 02:41.462
UH-HUH. JUST ME AND...

02:41.462 --> 02:42.893
YOU.

02:42.893 --> 02:56.907
AND THEY WERE BECOMING
A NIGHTMARE.

02:56.907 --> 03:01.912
THE RESIDENTS OF WISTERIA LANE
ARE NOTHING IF NOT LOYAL.

03:01.912 --> 03:06.287
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.620
THEY ROOT FOR THE HOME TEAM...

03:12.723 --> 03:16.897
THEY SUPPORT
THEIR FAVORITE BRAND.

03:16.897 --> 03:20.901
BUT THE FIERCEST LOYALTY
ON WISTERIA LANE

03:20.901 --> 03:22.903
IS THE ONE BETWEEN FRIENDS.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.237
ALL RIGHT. I GOTTA RUN. I'M
MEETING THE GIRLS FOR COFFEE.

03:26.237 --> 03:27.978
STOP.

03:27.978 --> 03:30.311
WHICH GIRLS?
WILL BREE BE THERE?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.882
SHE BETTER BE. SHE'S BUYING.

03:31.882 --> 03:33.914
THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.647
WAIT. YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT US
NEVER SPEAKING TO BREE AGAIN?

03:36.647 --> 03:39.290
THAT WOMAN SAT AT OUR TABLE,
SPENT THE HOLIDAYS WITH US,

03:39.290 --> 03:41.552
ALL THE WHILE KNOWING
HER SON RAN OVER MY MOTHER.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.894
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.
 FINE, THEN YOU
STOP TALKING TO HER.

03:43.894 --> 03:46.927
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA CONTROL ME,
'CAUSE I HAVE THE SECRET WEAPON.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.601
YOU'LL WITHHOLD SEX? PLEASE.
YOU ALWAYS FOLD BEFORE I DO.

03:50.601 --> 03:52.833
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.336
THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED,
YOU GOT SO TURNED ON

03:55.336 --> 03:58.008
TELLING ME WHAT YOU WEREN'T
GONNA DO TO ME,

03:58.008 --> 04:00.571
YOU WOUND UP DOING IT
TO ME RIGHT THEN.
 (whispers) DAMN IT.

04:00.571 --> 04:03.243
(normal voice) WELL,
YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA STOP ME

04:03.243 --> 04:05.876
FROM SEEING BREE.
 YES, I AM.

04:05.876 --> 04:07.878
OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THAT WOMAN IS OVER,

04:07.878 --> 04:11.652
AND I FORBID YOU
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

04:11.652 --> 04:15.025
HE FORBID ME.
 WHO IS HE TO FORBID ME?

04:15.025 --> 04:17.387
I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS, 19...

04:17.387 --> 04:20.391
WHENEVER IT WAS THAT HUSBANDS
GOT TO FORBID THEIR WIVES?

04:20.391 --> 04:22.833
GABY, HE HAS EVERY REASON
TO BE UPSET.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.335
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

04:24.335 --> 04:27.298
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP
OUR DISTANCE FOR A WHILE.

04:27.298 --> 04:31.602
What? I'm not giving in
to this.
 I've already caused Carlos
so much pain.

04:31.602 --> 04:33.544
I think it's the only thing
we can do.

04:33.544 --> 04:35.776
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.978
NO MORE POKER?
NO MORE LUNCHES?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.980
(voice breaking)
NO MORE SHOPPING?

04:39.980 --> 04:42.513
I'LL MISS IT
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.915
OH, REALLY?
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT.

04:44.915 --> 04:47.588
I THINK THIS IS EASY
FOR YOU.
 Easy?

04:47.588 --> 04:49.289
I WANNA COME OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.592
SO YOU CAN DRAG ME TO THE MALL
KICKING AND SCREAMING,

04:51.592 --> 04:53.293
BUT WE CAN'T.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.996
(whispers) I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE SCONES IN THE OVEN.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.899
I LOVE YOUR SCONES.
 Stop.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.071
GOOD-BYE, GABY.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.537
YOU'RE NOT HANGING UP.

05:06.537 --> 05:08.439
BUT I HAVE TO.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.012
(beep)

05:13.384 --> 05:14.385
(beep)

05:17.518 --> 05:20.320
HEY, LYNETTE! YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS. I--
 SHH!

05:20.320 --> 05:23.053
(lowered voice) I HAD TO
WALK PAIGE AROUND THE BLOCK

05:23.053 --> 05:26.457
EIGHT TIMES TO GET HER DOWN.

05:26.457 --> 05:28.098
(sighs)

05:28.098 --> 05:32.062
NOTHING IS SO IMPORTANT THAT
YOU NEED TO RAISE YOUR VOICE.

05:32.062 --> 05:35.065
NOT EVEN THIS?

05:36.967 --> 05:39.640
WEISMAN
LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.612
(whispers) SERIOUSLY?

05:41.612 --> 05:43.043
(gasps) YOU'RE INVITED?!

05:43.043 --> 05:47.448
(whispers) AND SO ARE YOU.
 (muffled voice) OH, MY GOD!

05:47.448 --> 05:50.120
WARREN BUFFETT GOES
TO THIS CONFERENCE,

05:50.120 --> 05:53.053
AND BILL GATES AND OPRAH--

05:53.053 --> 05:55.826
IT'S ONE
OF HER FAVORITE THINGS.

05:55.826 --> 06:00.391
OH! LOOK AT THIS!
ALL THE GREAT SPEAKERS.

06:00.391 --> 06:04.064
PLUS THEY'VE GOT THE SPA,
AND--
 AND NO KIDS, RIGHT? NO KIDS?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.736
NO KIDS.

06:05.736 --> 06:07.868
(normal voice) YES! YES!
 (laughs)

06:07.868 --> 06:10.641
(crying)

06:10.641 --> 06:14.745
YOU TAKE HER. I GOTTA
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO WEAR.

06:14.745 --> 06:18.679
(continues crying)

06:18.679 --> 06:20.380
(door creaks)

06:20.380 --> 06:22.483
HEY, YOU TWO!
THANKS FOR WATCHING HIM.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.816
(chuckles)
 HEY, CAN YOU WATCH HIM AGAIN
ON WEDNESDAY? MIKE AND I ARE--

06:25.816 --> 06:27.988
YEAH, I KNOW. YOUR BIG NIGHT,
HUH? (clicks tongue)

06:27.988 --> 06:29.990
MIKE TOLD YOU?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.993
DIDN'T HAVE TO. I CAUGHT HIM
STARING AT MY CLEAVAGE.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.927
SO... POST-TRANSPLANT SEX,
HUH?

06:36.927 --> 06:39.430
IF IT'S AS GOOD
AS MY POST-CANCER SEX,

06:39.430 --> 06:41.432
YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.504
FINGERS CROSSED.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.006
HEY, HAVE YOU LOOKED
AT YOUR OLD HOUSE LATELY?

06:46.006 --> 06:47.978
IT'S KIND OF A WRECK.

06:47.978 --> 06:51.942
DOES LOOK A LITTLE NEGLECTED.

06:51.942 --> 06:54.485
YOU SHOULD GO OVER AND TALK
TO PAUL. I'LL WATCH M.J.

06:54.485 --> 06:57.117
OH. I... CAN'T DO THAT.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.750
UM, I MEAN, HE MIGHT BE
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.122
OR HE MIGHT BE HANGING
FROM THE SHOWERHEAD.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.855
DO ME A FAVOR AND CHECK.

07:04.855 --> 07:07.898
'CAUSE IF HE'S DEAD IN THERE,
I LIVE DOWNWIND.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.565
(sighs)

07:18.509 --> 07:20.110
(gasps)

07:20.110 --> 07:21.942
SUSAN?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.644
PAUL?

07:23.644 --> 07:26.517
PAUL. UH... HI THERE.

07:26.517 --> 07:29.079
UM... I-I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

07:29.079 --> 07:31.582
AND IT--AND IT LOOKED LIKE
THINGS WERE PILING UP,

07:31.582 --> 07:33.624
AND WOULD YOU MIND
CLOSING THAT ROBE, PLEASE?

07:33.624 --> 07:36.587
OH, SORRY.
AND SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

07:36.587 --> 07:39.790
I HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING
OUT OF THE HOUSE MUCH.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.993
YOU LOOK THIN.
ARE YOU EATING?

07:42.993 --> 07:44.565
YES.

07:44.565 --> 07:48.799
I'M FINE. I'M A LITTLE
BEHIND ON MY CHORES.

07:48.799 --> 07:51.071
SO IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE...

07:51.071 --> 07:54.945
PAUL, UM...
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

07:54.945 --> 07:58.148
YES, SUSAN.
FIT AS A FIDDLE.

07:58.148 --> 07:59.850
GOOD-BYE.

08:00.951 --> 08:03.614
(sighs)

08:15.125 --> 08:17.127
(indistinct conversations)

08:17.127 --> 08:19.830
(Tom, lowered voice) I'VE
ALREADY SPOTTED TWO EX-SENATORS

08:19.830 --> 08:21.832
AND THREE COVERS OF "FORBES."

08:21.832 --> 08:23.834
EVERYBODY HERE
IS DEFINITELY A-LIST.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.136
(chuckles)

08:26.136 --> 08:28.208
OH! BOB! LEE!

08:28.208 --> 08:30.210
HEY, HEY, YOU FANCY HOTSHOTS.
 HI!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.182
MWAH.
 MWAH.

08:32.182 --> 08:33.583
HIYA.
 HI.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.946
GLAD YOU'VE DONE
THIS CONFERENCE BEFORE,

08:35.946 --> 08:38.948
'CAUSE I'M DEFINITELY GONNA NEED
SOMEBODY TO SHOW ME THE ROPES.
 NOTHING TO IT.
JUST DON'T TALK POLITICS.

08:38.948 --> 08:41.251
AND DON'T PUSH WARREN BUFFETT
IN THE POOL.

08:41.251 --> 08:43.523
I DIDN'T PUSH HIM.
HE GOT BETWEEN ME

08:43.523 --> 08:45.025
AND THE MARGARITA BAR.
(mouths words)

08:45.025 --> 08:47.858
OH, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO BARRY WEISMAN.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.160
PREPARE TO ENDURE THE SINGLE
MOST BONE-CRUSHING HANDSHAKE

08:50.160 --> 08:52.262
OF YOUR LIFE.

08:52.262 --> 08:53.864
BYE.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.165
COME ON.

08:55.165 --> 08:58.839
WELL, WITH THIS LINE, IT'S GONNA
BE HARD TO GET DRUNK.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.842
LESSON ONE--
THE POWER OF THE WORDS

09:01.842 --> 09:03.714
"THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL
OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS

09:03.714 --> 09:05.015
WANT THEIR MARTINIS NOW."

09:05.015 --> 09:06.717
(chuckles)

09:14.184 --> 09:15.686
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

09:15.686 --> 09:17.688
THAT'S A LITTLE TRICK
I LEARNED

09:17.688 --> 09:20.691
WHEN I WAS TOO CHEAP
TO BUY MY OWN NEWSPAPERS.
 (laughs)

09:20.691 --> 09:23.994
HOW FANTASTIC IS IT THAT
CHRIS CAVANAUGH IS SPEAKING?

09:23.994 --> 09:26.066
I THOUGHT "FLASHPOINT" WAS
THE BEST BUSINESS BOOK

09:26.066 --> 09:27.137
OF THE YEAR.
 I AGREE.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.840
I'VE HEARD HIM SPEAK BEFORE.
HE'S EVEN BETTER IN PERSON.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.172
WE'RE IN FOR A TREAT TOMORROW.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.845
MEG BUTLER,
PRESIDENT OF AMTech.

09:34.845 --> 09:36.146
OH, UM...

09:36.146 --> 09:37.848
UH, LYNETTE SCAVO.

09:37.848 --> 09:40.681
MY HUSBAND IS THE C.F.O.
OF MORRIS TECHNOLOGIES.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.953
OH. YOU'RE A PLUS ONE.

09:42.953 --> 09:44.615
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

09:44.615 --> 09:47.618
UNFORTUNATELY, IT MEANS YOU
WON'T BE SEEING CHRIS CAVANAUGH.

09:47.618 --> 09:49.760
THE SEMINARS
ARE ONLY FOR PARTICIPANTS.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.692
WHA--

09:51.692 --> 09:55.726
WHAT AM I GONNA BE DOING?
 I WILL TELL YOU WHAT--
JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGING.

09:55.726 --> 09:59.069
DID I WEEP AT THE SIMPLE BEAUTY
OF MY DESIGN LAST YEAR? YES.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.672
YES, I DID.
 I DON'T WANT TO
ARRANGE FLOWERS.

10:01.672 --> 10:03.774
WHY ARE THEY DIVIDING US UP
LIKE THIS?

10:03.774 --> 10:06.036
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
SOME OF US SPENT OUR LIVES

10:06.036 --> 10:08.739
WORKING OUR WAY UP
THE CORPORATE LADDER,

10:08.739 --> 10:11.181
AND OTHERS JUST MARRIED
SOMEONE WHO DID.

10:11.181 --> 10:13.043
EXCUSE ME.

10:14.685 --> 10:16.616
OH, NO.
 THAT'S--

10:16.616 --> 10:19.149
WOW. THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

10:19.149 --> 10:21.151
I REALLY WANT
TO SEE THOSE SEMINARS.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.653
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

10:22.653 --> 10:26.256
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE
 WHAT THEY HAVE PLANNED FOR US.

10:26.256 --> 10:29.159
(blows whistle) ATTENTION!

10:29.159 --> 10:32.162
IF I COULD HAVE ALL
OF MY PLUS ONES FIND A BUDDY,

10:32.162 --> 10:35.035
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER WITH A SCAVENGER HUNT.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.037
(excited murmuring)

10:37.037 --> 10:38.338
(mouths words)

10:38.338 --> 10:41.341
(lively
indistinct conversations)

10:43.944 --> 10:45.175
(mouths words)

10:50.350 --> 10:52.052
(door opens)

10:53.724 --> 10:54.885
BREE.

10:54.885 --> 10:57.127
GABY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:57.127 --> 10:59.359
I JUST CAME BY
TO TALK TO LYNETTE.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.361
OH, SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.264
SHE ASKED ME TO WATER THE PLANTS
AND COLLECT THE MAIL.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.237
OH.

11:07.237 --> 11:09.039
YOU LOOK GOOD.

11:09.039 --> 11:12.042
YOU, TOO.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.844
NEW COAT?

11:13.844 --> 11:16.046
YOU NOTICED.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.378
I SHOULD GO.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.081
CAN'T YOU JUST STAY AND TALK?

11:21.081 --> 11:24.154
MAYBE HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE?
 GABY, WE SHOULDN'T.

11:24.154 --> 11:26.957
IT'S JUST COFFEE, BREE.
 BUT YOUR HUSBAND...

11:26.957 --> 11:29.219
HE'D NEVER LOOK
FOR US HERE.

11:29.219 --> 11:31.391
OH, COME ON.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.965
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD FOR ME
NOT SEEING YOU.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.696
AW, IT'S BEEN HARD
FOR ME, TOO,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.698
ESPECIALLY WITH LYNETTE
OUT OF TOWN.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.400
I MEAN, THERE'S SUSAN,
OF COURSE,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.402
BUT LATELY WHATEVER TOPIC
YOU BRING UP,

11:42.402 --> 11:44.434
SHE MANAGES TO STEER IT
RIGHT BACK TO KIDNEYS.

11:44.434 --> 11:47.477
TELL ME ABOUT IT. (chuckles)
 (chuckles)

11:51.041 --> 11:54.384
WELL, I GUESS I...
COULD PUT ON A POT.

11:54.384 --> 11:57.247
I LIKE MINE WITH CREAM.

11:57.247 --> 12:00.450
I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE IT.

12:02.753 --> 12:03.894
(whoosh)

12:03.894 --> 12:05.896
(doorbell rings)

12:09.129 --> 12:11.061
HELLO, KAREN.

12:11.061 --> 12:15.165
FELICIA. HI.

12:15.165 --> 12:17.167
WHEN DID THEY LET YOU OUT?

12:17.167 --> 12:19.870
ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

12:19.870 --> 12:24.975
I JUST STOPPED BY BECAUSE
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS.

12:24.975 --> 12:27.778
IT BELONGED TO MY SISTER,
AND...

12:27.778 --> 12:29.980
SHE WAS ALWAYS
SO FOND OF YOU.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.322
THAT'S SWEET.

12:32.322 --> 12:35.125
IT'S MY SMALL WAY
OF SAYING THANKS

12:35.125 --> 12:37.257
FOR KEEPING MY SECRET
ALL THOSE YEARS.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.462
YEAH, NOT MUCH A SECRET
ANYMORE.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.434
DON'T I KNOW IT.

12:44.434 --> 12:46.436
BUT I'VE KEPT YOUR SECRET.

12:46.436 --> 12:49.499
I NEVER TOLD A SOUL
ABOUT YOUR ROLE THAT NIGHT,

12:49.499 --> 12:51.902
AND I NEVER WILL.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.077
(lowers voice) UM...

12:57.077 --> 13:01.211
IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

13:01.211 --> 13:03.453
I UNDERSTAND.

13:03.453 --> 13:06.386
BUT I HOPE YOU'LL STOP BY
MY PLACE SOMETIME.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.089
WE HAVE SO MUCH
CATCHING UP TO DO.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.091
SURE. (chuckles)
I'LL DO THAT.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.262
(chuckles)

13:14.094 --> 13:16.096
UH, WH-WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.930
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?
I'M MOVING IN NEXT DOOR.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.833
WE'RE GOING TO BE NEIGHBORS.

13:27.277 --> 13:29.339
WHO WAS THAT?

13:29.339 --> 13:32.442
JUST AN OLD FRIEND.

13:32.442 --> 13:36.186
OLD FRIEND? YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.150
MAKE ME A DRINK,
WILL YOU, SWEETIE?

13:47.257 --> 13:49.960
(Karen) TOBY!
 (toy squeaks)

13:49.960 --> 13:51.261
HERE, KITTY, KITTY.
 (squeak)

13:51.261 --> 13:53.964
TOBY! WHERE ARE YOU?
 (squeak)

13:53.964 --> 13:56.236
HERE, KITTY, KITTY!

13:56.236 --> 13:57.938
(squeak)
 TOBY!

13:57.938 --> 14:00.110
OH, FELICIA, HELP ME OUT.

14:00.110 --> 14:04.214
(squeak)
 IDA GREENBERG'S LOST
HER STUPID CAT AGAIN.

14:04.214 --> 14:06.216
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
IS THAT BLOOD?

14:06.216 --> 14:08.018
YOU NEVER SAW ME.

14:08.018 --> 14:11.521
I HAVE TO GO.
 YOUR HAND! LET ME CALL YOU
AN AMBULANCE.

14:15.986 --> 14:18.128
YOU LOVE MY SISTER, RIGHT?

14:18.128 --> 14:20.230
MARTHA? Y-YEAH.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.132
AND YOU KNOW
PAUL YOUNG MURDERED HER?

14:22.132 --> 14:24.434
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.170
OH, MY GOD.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.871
DID YOU KILL PAUL?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.173
NO!

14:33.173 --> 14:36.176
HE KILLED ME.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.507
WHAT?

14:37.507 --> 14:40.510
THEY'LL FIND MY BLOOD IN HIS
HOUSE AND MY FINGERS IN THE CAR,

14:40.510 --> 14:43.914
AND HE'LL SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON

14:43.914 --> 14:47.417
IF YOU SAY
YOU NEVER SAW ME.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.290
DON'T ASK ME TO DO THIS.
 PLEASE, KAREN!

14:50.290 --> 14:53.623
PAUL GOT AWAY
WITH MARTHA'S MURDER,

14:53.623 --> 14:58.128
BUT... HE WON'T
GET AWAY WITH MINE.

15:09.179 --> 15:12.542
TOBY.
 (squeaking)

15:12.542 --> 15:15.215
HERE, KITTY, KITTY!

15:15.215 --> 15:16.646
(squeak)

15:26.926 --> 15:31.701
IKEBANA IS ALL ABOUT BRINGING
TOGETHER NATURE AND HUMANITY.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.203
THE THREE MAIN BRANCHES,

15:33.203 --> 15:36.936
OR SHUSHI, REPRESENT CHI--
 EARTH,

15:36.936 --> 15:41.511
TEN-- HEAVEN, AND JIN-- MAN.

15:41.511 --> 15:44.344
INTERESTING.
NOTHING TO REPRESENT WOMAN.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.317
HOW ABOUT THIS
INSIGNIFICANT CLUMP OF MOSS?

15:47.317 --> 15:49.619
WE COULD STUFF IT
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM,

15:49.619 --> 15:51.621
WHERE IT WILL ONLY SPEAK
WHEN SPOKEN TO.

15:51.621 --> 15:54.624
DOES MY CHI
 LOOK A LITTLE DROOPY?
 DID YOU HEAR ME?

15:54.624 --> 15:56.286
YES.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.288
YES, LYNETTE, I HEARD YOU.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.630
I HEARD YOU DURING YOGA,
DURING THE FASHION SHOW,

16:00.630 --> 16:03.193
ALL THROUGH SALSA DANCING--
"LIFE IS UNFAIR."

16:03.193 --> 16:05.195
OLé!
 WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAME HERE

16:05.195 --> 16:07.697
TO LEARN NEW THINGS
AND MEET INTERESTING PEOPLE,

16:07.697 --> 16:11.701
NOT TO PRETEND THAT PUTTING
STICKS IN A VASE IS ART.

16:11.701 --> 16:14.174
ARE WE STILL
HAVING A PROBLEM?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.046
YES, WE STILL ARE.

16:16.046 --> 16:18.708
DOESN'T IT PISS YOU ALL OFF

16:18.708 --> 16:21.151
THAT WE'RE STUCK
IN OUR GILDED CAGE,

16:21.151 --> 16:23.453
FORBIDDEN TO GO
TO INTERESTING SEMINARS

16:23.453 --> 16:26.316
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE PLUS ONES?
 NO.

16:26.316 --> 16:29.519
THIS IS FUN. I REALLY
FEEL LIKE I'M IN JAPAN.

16:29.519 --> 16:32.222
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA IN THE 21st CENTURY,

16:32.222 --> 16:35.295
NOT SOME OPPRESSIVE
PATRIARCHAL REGIME.

16:35.295 --> 16:39.299
IT MAY BE SMALL AND RED,

16:39.299 --> 16:42.372
BUT THIS LANYARD
IS NO BETTER THAN A BURKA!

16:42.372 --> 16:47.037
OH, DEAR.
 WE NEED TO STORM THE GATES
AND DEMAND TO BE LET INSIDE!

16:47.037 --> 16:49.339
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE THE REST
OF YOUR FLOWERS, CAN I--

16:49.339 --> 16:51.641
COME ON! RISE UP!
IF WE DO IT TOGETHER,

16:51.641 --> 16:55.145
WE WILL NOT BE DENIED!
 (whistle blows)

16:55.145 --> 16:56.446
(singsongy) 4:00, PEOPLE!

16:56.446 --> 16:58.718
I THINK YOU'VE ALL EARNED
A COCKTAIL.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.251
(excited murmuring)

17:01.251 --> 17:02.652
NO. NO!

17:02.652 --> 17:05.724
NO, DO NOT DRINK THOSE!

17:05.724 --> 17:09.028
THOSE ARE THE--THE COCKTAILS
OF OPPRESSION,

17:09.028 --> 17:13.303
MAKE FROM EQUAL PARTS TYRANNY
AND BLIND OBEDIENCE, AND...

17:13.303 --> 17:17.767
OH, SCREW IT.

17:17.767 --> 17:21.340
MMM. THIS IS THE BEST
PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE

17:21.340 --> 17:24.144
YOU HAVE EVER MADE.
 YOU KNOW WHY?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.816
IT HAS AN INGREDIENT MY CAKES
HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE...

17:26.816 --> 17:29.149
(whispers) DANGER. (laughs)

17:29.149 --> 17:31.451
I KNOW! SNEAKING AROUND
MAKES EVERYTHING TASTE BETTER.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.822
(fork clatters)

17:32.822 --> 17:36.256
WHEN I WAS WITH JOHN ROWLAND,
EVERY SENSE WAS HEIGHTENED.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.789
IT WAS LIKE THIS...

17:39.789 --> 17:42.592
SKIP IT.
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
 (clatter)

17:42.592 --> 17:45.465
OH, REALLY? WOULDN'T I?

17:45.465 --> 17:48.138
(silverware clatters)
 WHAT? YOU? NO WAY.

17:48.138 --> 17:51.141
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T TRUMPET
MY INDISCRETIONS LIKE YOU DO,

17:51.141 --> 17:54.073
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVEN'T HAD
A LITTLE WALK ON THE WILD SIDE.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.106
YOU CHEATED ON REX?
 OF COURSE NOT.

17:56.106 --> 17:59.078
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?
I CHEATED ON ORSON.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.079
WITH WHO?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.482
(whispers) KARL MAYER.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.184
OH, MY GOD!

18:04.184 --> 18:06.286
HE WAS A SLIMEBALL,
BUT HE WAS HOT.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.718
MM. WE'D MEET
AT THIS CHEAP HOTEL,

18:08.718 --> 18:12.662
AND AS GUILTY AS IT MADE ME,
I STILL FELT THIS... TINGLE,

18:12.662 --> 18:15.525
THIS FRISSON
I'D NEVER FELT BEFORE.

18:15.525 --> 18:19.369
AND NOW THIS WEEK WITH YOU...
(whispers) IT'S BACK.

18:19.369 --> 18:20.830
HMM.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.303
JUST WISH LYNETTE DIDN'T
HAVE TO COME HOME TOMORROW.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.678
ACTUALLY, THAT MOTEL STORY
GIVES ME AN IDEA.

18:28.678 --> 18:31.841
GABY, I'M FLATTERED, BUT I
REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD--
 NOT THAT.

18:31.841 --> 18:35.245
THERE'S A GREAT NEW SPA
THAT JUST OPENED ON FOSTER LAKE.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.287
WE SHOULD GO NEXT WEEKEND.

18:37.287 --> 18:38.718
DO WE DARE?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.321
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.322
(giggles)

18:42.322 --> 18:45.595
I WENT BY OUR HOUSE TODAY.

18:45.595 --> 18:47.627
IT'S LOOKING
A LITTLE RUN-DOWN.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.629
YEAH? YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO PAUL?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.202
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
KEEPING THE PLACE UP.

18:52.202 --> 18:54.634
UH, ACTUALLY, I ALREADY DID.
UH...

18:54.634 --> 18:57.467
HE SEEMS
KIND OF RUN-DOWN, TOO.

18:57.467 --> 19:00.910
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TALKING TO PAUL?

19:00.910 --> 19:05.675
WELL, I WAS PICKING UP M.J.,
AND HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE,

19:05.675 --> 19:08.548
AND...
KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.520
WHY? WHO CARES?

19:10.520 --> 19:13.152
MIKE, HE GAVE ME A KIDNEY.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.924
NO, BETH GAVE YOU A KIDNEY.

19:14.924 --> 19:17.427
PAUL DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO BLOCK IT.

19:17.427 --> 19:20.360
YEAH, BUT WE TALKED,
AND AFTER, HE SEEMED SO SAD.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.362
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!

19:22.362 --> 19:26.866
I KNOW YOU FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY,
BUT I DON'T TRUST HIM.
 (sighs)

19:26.866 --> 19:30.500
PLEASE...
JUST DO ME A FAVOR

19:30.500 --> 19:32.942
AND STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

19:32.942 --> 19:35.275
OKAY.

19:35.275 --> 19:39.509
NOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE FUN?

19:39.509 --> 19:42.552
LIKE OUR PLAN FOR SEX NIGHT?

19:42.552 --> 19:43.713
(both chuckle)

19:43.713 --> 19:47.857
OKAY, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.

19:47.857 --> 19:51.321
(shower running)

20:01.731 --> 20:03.773
(curtain rings rattle)

20:03.773 --> 20:05.405
MAY I COME IN?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.879
PLEASE.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.915
(gasps)

20:15.915 --> 20:18.918
(breathing deeply)

20:32.932 --> 20:35.935
(piano playing,
indistinct conversations)

20:40.009 --> 20:42.011
LYNETTE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:42.011 --> 20:44.314
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A SPA THING.

20:44.314 --> 20:46.616
OH, PLEASE.
I CAN GET A FACE FULL OF STEAM

20:46.616 --> 20:49.979
STANDING OVER A POT OF SPAGHETTI
ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK.

20:49.979 --> 20:52.982
I WANNA SEE CHRIS CAVANAUGH.
 I KNOW, AND I ASKED,
AND THEY SAID NO.

20:52.982 --> 20:54.984
THE KEYNOTE SPEECH
ISN'T FOR SPOUSES.

20:54.984 --> 20:57.657
THEY SAID THEY'VE GOT OTHER
ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR YOU.

20:57.657 --> 21:01.361
ACTIVITIES THAT THEY PLAN
FOR ME? TOM, I'M NOT A CHILD.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.862
OH!

21:05.264 --> 21:08.568
(lowered voice) I'M A GROWN-UP.
I'LL DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO DO.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.571
COME ON. DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I WANNA SEE THIS GUY?

21:11.571 --> 21:16.045
CAN'T YOU PULL SOME STRINGS?
 I DON'T HAVE ANY STRINGS. WHEN
I'VE BEEN FIVE OR SIX TIMES,

21:16.045 --> 21:19.048
THEN MAYBE I CAN ASK
FOR A FAVOR, BUT NOT NOW.

21:19.048 --> 21:21.050
THERE YOU ARE.
SOMEONE'S BEEN NAUGHTY.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.913
LET'S GO, MRS. SCAVO. I THINK
IT'S SOMEBODY'S SPA TIME.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.415
(ice cubes clink)

21:25.415 --> 21:29.689
THIS IS WHY YOU KEEP US DRUNK,
HUH? SO WE DON'T FIGHT BACK.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.665
THIS HITS THE SPOT.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.667
I REMEMBERED YOU LIKE
YOUR COFFEE

21:37.667 --> 21:41.030
SAME WAY YOU LIKE YOUR MEN--
STRONG... AND IRISH.

21:41.030 --> 21:42.532
(both chuckle)

21:42.532 --> 21:45.034
SO HOW DID YOU GET OUT
OF JAIL SO SOON?

21:45.034 --> 21:46.706
WAS IT GOOD BEHAVIOR

21:46.706 --> 21:49.679
OR BAD BEHAVIOR
WITH THE WARDEN?

21:49.679 --> 21:51.441
OH, KAREN.

21:51.441 --> 21:56.786
HOW I'VE MISSED YOUR FRANK
AND SALTY QUESTIONS.

21:56.786 --> 21:58.848
ACTUALLY, IT WAS, UH,

21:58.848 --> 22:01.991
WHAT THEY CALL
HUMANITARIAN RELEASE.

22:01.991 --> 22:04.724
YOU SEE...

22:04.724 --> 22:07.927
MY ONLY DAUGHTER
PASSED AWAY JUST RECENTLY.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.100
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.962
SUCH A SWEET GIRL.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.334
SO YOUNG.

22:16.466 --> 22:19.539
SHE WAS BARELY 30
WHEN SHE DIED.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.641
I WISH I COULD HAVE MET HER.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.643
ACTUALLY,
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DID.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.446
HER NAME WAS BETH.
BETH YOUNG.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.752
CAN I... FRESHEN THAT?

22:36.786 --> 22:39.829
SO WE'LL CUT YOU BACK
TO TEN EVERY OTHER DAY

22:39.829 --> 22:42.832
ON THE PREDNISONE AND TAKE IT
FROM THERE. ANY QUESTIONS?

22:42.832 --> 22:45.134
I DO HAVE ONE.

22:45.134 --> 22:47.066
SHOOT.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.569
IS IT COMMON FOR PATIENTS
TO HAVE SEX DREAMS

22:49.569 --> 22:52.602
ABOUT THE HUSBANDS
OF THEIR DEAD DONORS?

22:52.602 --> 22:56.375
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.378
UNDERSTAND--AWAKE, I HAVE NO
 CONSCIOUS DESIRE FOR THIS MAN.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.850
BUT IN MY DREAMS...

23:00.850 --> 23:04.414
SUSAN, I'M NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.
 BUT YOU WENT TO MED SCHOOL.

23:04.414 --> 23:06.716
YOU MUST HAVE LEARNED
SOMETHING ABOUT DREAMS--

23:06.716 --> 23:08.718
A COURSE, A BOOK.

23:08.718 --> 23:12.522
OKAY. WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT
BEFORE YOU WENT TO SLEEP?

23:12.522 --> 23:15.465
I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM.
 OH.

23:15.465 --> 23:17.767
I MEAN, HE'S NOT DOING
VERY WELL, AND I GOT

23:17.767 --> 23:21.000
IN AN ARGUMENT WITH MY HUSBAND
ABOUT WHETHER I SHOULD HELP HIM.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.534
WELL, MAYBE THE DREAM IS TELLING
YOU TO FOLLOW THAT IMPULSE.

23:24.534 --> 23:27.036
THE MAN'S WIFE DIED.
YOU'RE ALIVE BECAUSE OF IT.

23:27.036 --> 23:29.609
IT'S NATURAL
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM

23:29.609 --> 23:32.512
AND WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE'S OKAY.
 MIKE REALLY DOESN'T WANT ME
TO TALK TO HIM.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.013
IT'S YOUR CALL,

23:34.013 --> 23:39.048
BUT MY GUESS IS YOUR DREAMS
WON'T STOP UNTIL YOU DO.

23:39.048 --> 23:41.050
WHEN PAUL WENT TO JAIL,

23:41.050 --> 23:44.053
HIS ONE GOAL WAS TO MAKE ME
PAY FOR PUTTING HIM THERE,

23:44.053 --> 23:47.597
SO HE WROTE TO BETH,
BEGGING HER TO COME SEE HIM.

23:47.597 --> 23:51.430
HE SAID HE WAS INNOCENT,
THAT HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.204
PAUL'S VERY CHARMING WHEN
HE WANTS TO BE, AND BETH...

23:55.204 --> 23:57.507
SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM,

23:57.507 --> 24:00.039
JUST LIKE HE KNEW
SHE WOULD.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.041
WELL, DIDN'T YOU TRY
TO WARN HER?

24:02.041 --> 24:06.445
OF COURSE. SHE JUST SAID
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM LIKE SHE DID.

24:06.445 --> 24:10.219
WHEN HE WAS RELEASED,
WHEN HE HAD DEFILED HER,

24:10.219 --> 24:12.482
THE REAL PAUL CAME OUT.

24:12.482 --> 24:16.656
HE SAID HE'D NEVER LOVED HER,
THAT SHE WAS STUPID

24:16.656 --> 24:19.689
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T
DESERVE TO LIVE.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.064
S-SO SHE KILLED HERSELF...

24:25.064 --> 24:28.237
JUST LIKE HE KNEW
SHE WOULD.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.469
BASTARD.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.772
I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP
THIS STORY BETWEEN US

24:32.772 --> 24:34.473
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.776
BETH WOULD HATE
FOR ALL HER FRIENDS TO KNOW

24:36.776 --> 24:38.778
WHAT A FOOL SHE WAS.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.780
OKAY, BUT THE ONE THING
I DON'T GET

24:40.780 --> 24:44.013
IS WHY DO YOU WANNA LIVE ON
THE SAME STREET AS THAT MONSTER?

24:44.013 --> 24:46.015
(whispers)
SO I CAN WATCH HIM!

24:46.015 --> 24:50.019
(normal voice) IT'S TOO LATE
FOR BETH AND MY SISTER,

24:50.019 --> 24:52.562
BUT I WON'T LET HIM
DESTROY ANOTHER WOMAN

24:52.562 --> 24:54.764
THE WAY HE DESTROYED THEM.

24:54.764 --> 24:56.766
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
WATCHING HIM ALONE,

24:56.766 --> 24:58.898
BECAUSE I'LL KEEP MY EYE
ON THAT S.O.B., TOO.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.200
NOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING--
ANYTHING AT ALL--

25:01.200 --> 25:03.202
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.775
OH, KAREN.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.010
I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

25:13.883 --> 25:16.515
(New Age music playing)
 (sighs)

25:16.515 --> 25:19.518
(moans)

25:19.518 --> 25:22.592
WONDERFUL WHAT
A 4-HANDED MASSAGE CAN DO.

25:22.592 --> 25:25.054
ONE MORE HAND,
AND IT WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT,

25:25.054 --> 25:28.097
BUT THIS AIN'T
THAT KIND OF SPA.

25:28.097 --> 25:29.829
YEAH.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.602
NO, NO,
TELL HIM HE HAS A CHOICE.

25:32.602 --> 25:35.234
HE CAN SIGN THOSE PAPERS BEFORE
I SHOVE THEM DOWN HIS THROAT

25:35.234 --> 25:38.608
OR AFTER THEY COME OUT
THE OTHER END.

25:38.608 --> 25:42.842
I GUESS SOMEONE DIDN'T SEE
THE "NO CELL PHONES" SIGN.
 NO.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.845
I GUESS THAT RULE ONLY APPLIES
TO PLUS ONES.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.847
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.850
I WANNA GRAB A SOAK
BEFORE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH. BYE.
 (cell phone beeps)

26:15.204 --> 26:19.609
(indistinct conversations)

26:19.609 --> 26:21.110
OH, MS. BUTLER?

26:21.110 --> 26:22.612
HUH? OH, HI.

26:22.612 --> 26:26.085
YES, I'M HER. SHE'S ME.
MEG BUTLER. MEG.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.788
OH, WE HAVE A SEAT FOR YOU
UP FRONT.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.160
OH, UH...

26:31.160 --> 26:34.363
UH... GREAT.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.004
(amplified voice)
WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

26:45.004 --> 26:49.138
NOW TO INTRODUCE
OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER--

26:49.138 --> 26:51.340
THE PRESIDENT OF AMTech,
MS. MEG BUTLER.

26:54.143 --> 26:55.344
COME UP.

26:58.247 --> 27:00.920
COME ON. (mouths words)

27:15.634 --> 27:18.107
(amplified voice) HI.

27:20.269 --> 27:26.015
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW MEG
KNOW... I'M NOT MEG.

27:26.015 --> 27:28.317
NUTMEG. (chuckles) THAT'S FUNNY.

27:28.317 --> 27:34.283
UH, ANYWAY... MEG ASKED ME
TO INTRODUCE CHRIS CAVANAUGH

27:34.283 --> 27:38.157
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
WHAT A HUGE, HUGE FAN I AM.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.031
WHERE ARE YA,
YA BIG-BRAINED RASCAL?

27:42.031 --> 27:43.793
OH, THERE HE IS.

27:43.793 --> 27:46.335
ALMOST AS HOT
AS HIS AUTHOR PHOTO.

27:46.335 --> 27:48.297
(chuckles)

27:48.297 --> 27:50.369
ANYWAY...

27:50.369 --> 27:54.673
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T READ
"FLASHPOINT," DO IT IMMEDIATELY.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.675
PUT IT IN YOUR KINDLE,
YOUR iPad.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.809
I DON'T KNOW. BUY THE BOOK.
IT WILL MAKE YOU SMARTER,

27:59.809 --> 28:05.384
BECAUSE WHAT CHRIS CAVANAUGH
HAS TO SAY ABOUT HUMAN NATURE,

28:05.384 --> 28:08.287
ABOUT CREATIVITY,

28:08.287 --> 28:10.920
IS ABSOLUTELY--
 THERE SHE IS!

28:10.920 --> 28:14.994
THAT'S THE BITCH WHO STOLE
MY LANYARD AND MY CLOTHES!

28:14.994 --> 28:16.265
(audience murmuring)

28:16.265 --> 28:18.327
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
CHRIS CAVANAUGH.

28:18.327 --> 28:19.969
(microphone feedback)

28:19.969 --> 28:23.072
(murmuring continues)

28:23.072 --> 28:24.373
(exhales deeply)

28:32.181 --> 28:34.313
(sighs)
 HI. I CALLED YOU
A BUNCH OF TIMES.

28:34.313 --> 28:38.317
YOUR PHONE MUST BE BROKEN.
 IT IS NOW.
PLEASE RESPECT MY PRIVACY.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.850
PAUL, YOU HAVE TO LET ME
TALK TO YOU.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.321
WHY?

28:42.321 --> 28:45.424
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MESS,
AND SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.127
AND OKAY, I'M HAVING DREAMS
ABOUT US.

28:48.127 --> 28:51.901
DREAMS?
WHAT KIND OF DREAMS?

28:51.901 --> 28:53.402
REGULAR DREAMS--

28:53.402 --> 28:55.504
LOTS OF DAYLIGHT,
LOTS OF CLOTHES.

28:55.504 --> 28:58.467
LOOK, I'M YOUR LANDLORD.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO COME IN.

28:58.467 --> 29:01.270
BUT I'D LIKE YOU
TO INVITE ME IN.

29:07.276 --> 29:10.049
(door closes)

29:10.049 --> 29:12.381
GETTING READY
TO COOK SOMETHING?

29:12.381 --> 29:14.924
I SEE ONIONS, POTATOES,

29:14.924 --> 29:16.926
THIS LONG GREEN AND WHITE THING

29:16.926 --> 29:19.058
WITH SCARY LITTLE HAIRS
ON THE BOTTOM.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.359
THIS IS FOOD, RIGHT?

29:20.359 --> 29:22.061
IT'S CALLED A LEEK.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.434
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
POTATO LEEK SOUP.

29:25.434 --> 29:27.436
I LOVE POTATO LEEK SOUP.

29:27.436 --> 29:30.199
OF COURSE, THAT WAS
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT A LEEK WAS.

29:30.199 --> 29:32.401
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

29:32.401 --> 29:34.904
COME ON. SOUP I CAN DO.

29:34.904 --> 29:38.247
MAKING SOUP? IS THAT WHAT
WE WERE DOING IN YOUR DREAM?

29:38.247 --> 29:41.250
NO. NO, WE WEREN'T.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.813
THAT REMINDS ME.
I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.088
(door closes)

29:49.088 --> 29:51.220
HEY. HOW WAS THE BIG CONFERENCE?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.364
OKAY.

29:55.364 --> 29:57.897
YOU MEET ANY GUYS FOR ME?
I'M NOT PICKY.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.899
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.071
(singsongy) UGLY PLUS MONEY
EQUALS HANDSOME.

30:02.071 --> 30:03.372
(chuckles) WELL, APPARENTLY,

30:03.372 --> 30:07.406
CRAZY PLUS WIFE
EQUALS LAUGHINGSTOCK.

30:07.406 --> 30:10.409
UH, YOU TWO HAVING A FIGHT?

30:10.409 --> 30:12.441
YEAH, KINDA.

30:12.441 --> 30:16.345
WELL, YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
I'M HERE.

30:18.047 --> 30:20.049
TOM, WHY DON'T
WE FINISH THIS LATER?

30:20.049 --> 30:21.550
(bottle cap clatters)
 OH, I'M SORRY.

30:21.550 --> 30:24.553
DO YOU NOT WANNA BE EMBARRASSED
IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIEND?

30:24.553 --> 30:26.555
WELL, SHE JUST
EMBARRASSED ME IN FRONT

30:26.555 --> 30:29.558
OF THE WHOLE FORTUNE 500.
 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS I CAN APOLOGIZE.

30:29.558 --> 30:32.231
AT SOME POINT, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LET IT GO.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.104
I KINDA DON'T FEEL LIKE
LETTING IT GO, LYNETTE.

30:35.104 --> 30:38.167
IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT
THAT YOU HUMILIATED ME.

30:38.167 --> 30:41.170
IT'S THAT AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
THAT I SUPPORTED YOU,

30:41.170 --> 30:44.443
TOOK A BACKSEAT TO YOUR CAREER,
YOU COULDN'T DO THE SAME FOR ME.

30:55.384 --> 30:57.456
(sighs) WHAT HAPPENED?

30:57.456 --> 30:59.558
IT WAS AWFUL.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.361
ALL WEEKEND, I WAS TREATED
LIKE A PLUS ONE,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.233
A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN, A--

31:04.233 --> 31:05.434
A WIFE!

31:05.434 --> 31:09.498
LYNETTE, IN TOM'S WORLD,
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

31:09.498 --> 31:12.201
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET USED TO IT.

31:12.201 --> 31:14.503
WHAT IF I DON'T WANNA
GET USED TO IT?

31:14.503 --> 31:17.206
WELL, TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WHO SPENT EIGHT YEARS

31:17.206 --> 31:19.608
BEING "MRS. THIRD BASEMAN,"

31:19.608 --> 31:22.081
YOU CAN BE A WIFE...

31:22.081 --> 31:24.914
OR YOU CAN BE A FIRST WIFE.

31:28.617 --> 31:29.888
I'M HOME.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
HI, HONEY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.393
WORKED STRAIGHT THROUGH LUNCH
AND I'M STARVING. (sighs)

31:34.393 --> 31:35.394
WHAT'S THIS?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.396
IT'S A PINEAPPLE
UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.198
WOW.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.302
REMINDS ME OF THE CAKE
YOUR OLD FRIEND BREE

31:43.302 --> 31:45.304
BROUGHT TO DINNER
LAST MONTH.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.076
(sniffs)

31:47.076 --> 31:51.340
HUH.
I-I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.682
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY BREE
DIDN'T MAKE THIS ONE,

31:53.682 --> 31:56.045
SINCE I DON'T SEE HER ANYMORE

31:56.045 --> 31:58.487
BECAUSE I KNOW...
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.

31:58.487 --> 32:00.419
SO... WHERE'D THIS
COME FROM?

32:00.419 --> 32:05.624
I... M-MADE IT.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.526
REALLY?
 (dish clatters)

32:07.526 --> 32:08.627
HMM.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.629
THE WOMAN WHO ORDERED IN
CHINESE FOOD

32:10.629 --> 32:13.532
FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER MADE
A PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.365
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

32:16.365 --> 32:21.270
IT'S JUST SOME PINEAPPLES
AND... UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.113
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:24.113 --> 32:27.216
THIS LOOKS... SO GOOD.

32:27.216 --> 32:30.379
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO MAKE ME ONE...

32:30.379 --> 32:31.680
JUST LIKE IT.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.052
RIGHT NOW?

32:33.052 --> 32:37.987
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA SIT HERE
AND WATCH YOU...

32:37.987 --> 32:40.389
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

32:40.389 --> 32:44.433
SURE. (scoffs)
(nasal voice) NO PROBLEM.

32:44.433 --> 32:47.096
(normal voice) UH...

32:47.096 --> 32:49.398
FIRST,
I'M GONNA GET SOME FLOUR,

32:49.398 --> 32:52.071
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE A CAKE
WITHOUT FLOUR, RIGHT?

32:52.071 --> 32:55.174
(chuckles nervously)

32:56.545 --> 33:00.449
OH, NO!
GOT IT ALL OVER ME.

33:00.449 --> 33:05.354
MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE MY TOP OFF.

33:05.354 --> 33:06.485
IN FACT...

33:06.485 --> 33:10.619
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO UP TO THE BEDROOM AND--

33:10.619 --> 33:13.022
MAKE THE CAKE.

33:13.022 --> 33:15.024
WELL,
YOU REALLY ARE HUNGRY.

33:15.024 --> 33:19.368
WELL,
LET ME FRESHEN UP FIRST.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.103
HE WANTS YOU TO MAKE
A PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE--

33:24.103 --> 33:26.375
THE WOMAN WHO ORDERED IN CHINESE
FOR CHRISTMAS?

33:26.375 --> 33:29.378
YES, WE'VE ALREADY COVERED THAT.
NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

33:29.378 --> 33:31.380
IF I CAN'T MAKE THIS,

33:31.380 --> 33:33.642
HE'S GONNA KNOW
I'VE BEEN SEEING YOU.

33:33.642 --> 33:36.485
JUST STALL HIM. I'LL MAKE ONE
AND SLIP IT TO YOU.

33:36.485 --> 33:39.448
(lowered voice) NO, HE WANTS
TO WATCH ME MAKE IT.

33:39.448 --> 33:41.390
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.
WE CAN DO THIS.

33:41.390 --> 33:44.093
HOW? (breathing deeply)

33:44.093 --> 33:45.624
OKAY!

33:45.624 --> 33:50.299
ONE PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE
COMING RIGHT UP.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.665
FIRST, PREHEAT YOUR OVEN TO 300.
 (beeping)

33:56.665 --> 34:00.239
FIRST, I'M GONNA PREHEAT
MY OVEN TO 300.

34:00.239 --> 34:04.073
THEN WE'RE GONNA START
WITH THE CARAMEL TOPPING.

34:04.073 --> 34:06.375
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA START
WITH THE CARAMEL TOPPING...

34:06.375 --> 34:11.080
FOR WHICH I WILL NEED...

34:11.080 --> 34:12.681
SUGAR. (chuckles)

34:14.422 --> 34:18.786
BROWN SUGAR. (chuckles)

34:18.786 --> 34:21.489
AND BUTTER.
HOW MUCH BUTTER?

34:21.489 --> 34:24.132
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

34:24.132 --> 34:26.435
UH... MY... GRANDMOTHER.

34:26.435 --> 34:28.797
SEE, THIS WAS HER RECIPE,
AND TALKING TO HER

34:28.797 --> 34:31.469
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
WE'RE MAKING IT TOGETHER.

34:33.242 --> 34:36.844
HOW MUCH BUTTER, GRANDMA?

34:36.844 --> 34:39.178
QUARTER CUP. GOT IT.

34:43.752 --> 34:46.185
AND?

34:46.185 --> 34:47.656
IT'S VERY GOOD.

34:47.656 --> 34:49.558
IT IS? HOT DAMN.

34:49.558 --> 34:52.491
YOU KNOW, TRUTHFULLY,
I WAS JUST KINDA WINGING IT.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.493
OH, AND IF YOU DON'T TASTE
THE WINE,

34:54.493 --> 34:56.495
IT'S 'CAUSE I DRANK IT.

34:58.327 --> 34:59.568
AHH.

35:05.804 --> 35:10.209
SO LAST TIME YOU AND I
HAD A MEAL TOGETHER,

35:10.209 --> 35:13.542
HAD TO BE...
BEFORE MARY ALICE DIED.

35:13.542 --> 35:16.615
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

35:16.615 --> 35:20.219
MAYBE WE SHOULD
START DOING THAT AGAIN.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.892
SUSAN...
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

35:23.892 --> 35:25.824
WHY DO YOU CARE?

35:25.824 --> 35:28.857
M.J.! NO RUNNING.

35:28.857 --> 35:30.559
AH, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

35:30.559 --> 35:32.861
IT'S NICE TO SEE SOMETHING
MOVING FAST IN HERE.

35:32.861 --> 35:34.863
THANKS. AND JUST TO WARN YOU,

35:34.863 --> 35:38.337
WE... MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE
PICKING HIM UP.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.638
YEAH? LOOKS LIKE

35:39.638 --> 35:42.341
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A LITTLE LATE GETTING STARTED.

35:46.315 --> 35:48.277
(door closes)

35:48.277 --> 35:51.750
I REMEMBER A GUY THAT USED
TO LIVE ON THIS STREET.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.453
HE TAUGHT MY DAUGHTER
TO SWIM.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.925
HE MADE
A KILLER BARBECUE TRI-TIP.

35:56.925 --> 35:59.658
HE HAD A LAUGH YOU COULD HEAR
THREE HOUSES AWAY.

35:59.658 --> 36:03.292
I LIKED THAT GUY.
 I'M NOT THAT MAN ANYMORE.
(sighs)

36:03.292 --> 36:07.296
I THINK YOU CAN BE.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.903
(spoon clatters)

36:14.903 --> 36:17.406
OH, YOU KNOW,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.810
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
I ASKED YOU NOT TO COME HERE.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.812
I KNOW,
BUT PAUL IS SUFFERING,

36:23.812 --> 36:26.485
AND EVERYONE ELSE
HAS TURNED THEIR BACK ON HIM.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.787
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE HE'S A BAD GUY!

36:28.787 --> 36:30.889
LOOK, YOU MIGHT HAVE FALLEN
FOR HIS ACT,

36:30.889 --> 36:34.192
BUT I HAVEN'T, AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.194
GET IN THE CAR.
WE'RE GOING.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.267
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

36:38.267 --> 36:41.270
MIKE, I--BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I AM NOT AN IDIOT.

36:41.270 --> 36:44.273
I DON'T NEED TO BE RESCUED
FROM WHATEVER TROUBLE IT IS

36:44.273 --> 36:46.375
YOU THINK
I'M GETTING MYSELF INTO.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.837
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS GUY
LIKE I DO.

36:48.837 --> 36:51.840
I KNOW THE LOOK IN SOMEBODY'S
EYES WHEN THEY'RE HURTING,

36:51.840 --> 36:55.514
AND I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL
I KNOW THAT PAUL'S OKAY.
 SO YOU'RE GOING BACK IN THERE.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.487
YEAH. SUPPORT ME OR NOT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

36:58.487 --> 37:00.589
(sighs)

37:02.451 --> 37:04.453
UGH!

37:08.427 --> 37:10.799
(bell dings)

37:10.799 --> 37:13.532
(beeps, clank)

37:15.464 --> 37:17.806
(oven door shuts)
 (sighs)

37:17.806 --> 37:19.668
OOH.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.875
(gasps)

37:26.875 --> 37:29.978
OH!

37:29.978 --> 37:33.582
I HEARD AN OVEN TIMER GO OFF.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

37:33.582 --> 37:35.754
NO! AAH! NOT YET!

37:37.526 --> 37:40.529
SECRET'S ALL IN THE COOLING,
AND IN FACT, IT'LL PROBABLY

37:40.529 --> 37:41.990
COOL FASTER
ON THE WINDOWSILL.

37:46.034 --> 37:47.766
(gasps)
 HI. WE'RE COLLECTING
FOR JUVENILE--

37:47.766 --> 37:51.570
OUT OF MY WAY! HOT CAKE!

37:51.570 --> 37:53.672
OKAY,
BUT WHILE WE ARE WAITING,

37:53.672 --> 37:56.545
THERE'S JUST ONE THING
I HAVE TO SAY.

37:56.545 --> 38:00.749
HEY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A CAKE.
THIS IS ABOUT TRUST.

38:00.749 --> 38:03.652
IT IS A SAD DAY WHEN A HUSBAND
FORCES A WIFE TO BAKE FOR HIM

38:03.652 --> 38:05.784
JUST TO PROVE
SHE'S NOT A LIAR.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.487
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW OFFENSIVE THAT IS?

38:08.487 --> 38:09.788
CAKE'S READY.

38:13.962 --> 38:20.729
AHH. THERE. ONE PERFECT
PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE.

38:20.729 --> 38:24.433
IF ONLY TRUST WERE SO EASY
TO MAKE.

38:34.583 --> 38:35.944
(door squeaks)

38:35.944 --> 38:38.947
(crickets chirping in distance)

38:41.350 --> 38:43.392
(exhales deeply)

38:53.632 --> 38:54.933
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

38:57.506 --> 38:59.708
I AM. (chuckles)

38:59.708 --> 39:01.710
AFTER THE WAY
I TALKED TO YOU,

39:01.710 --> 39:04.413
I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING
THE FIRING SQUAD.

39:04.413 --> 39:06.575
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

39:06.575 --> 39:09.848
BUT I DECIDED TO GO
FOR THE ROMANTIC DINNER.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.820
FIGURED, LESS CLEANUP.

39:13.882 --> 39:17.586
HONEY, I... I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PAUL.

39:17.586 --> 39:20.589
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

39:20.589 --> 39:23.762
AND YOU'RE JUST BEING YOU--
THE WOMAN THAT MAKES ME

39:23.762 --> 39:26.765
PULL OVER TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD IN A RAINSTORM

39:26.765 --> 39:28.767
TO PICK UP A SICK RACCOON.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.840
IT MY DEFENSE,
I DID THINK IT WAS A CAT.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.043
(chuckles) THE POINT IS...

39:35.043 --> 39:37.706
I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU

39:37.706 --> 39:42.451
FOR BEING THE KIND,
COMPASSIONATE WOMAN YOU ARE.

39:42.451 --> 39:45.914
ESPECIALLY SINCE
IT'S BEEN SIX WEEKS

39:45.914 --> 39:47.686
SINCE WE'VE HAD SEX.

39:49.658 --> 39:50.719
THAT, TOO.

39:50.719 --> 39:55.664
(laughing)

39:57.596 --> 40:00.098
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY WATCHING
THE GIRLS ALL WEEKEND?

40:00.098 --> 40:03.171
HEY, CAN'T MISS YOUR OLD
MODELING FRIEND'S FUNERAL.

40:03.171 --> 40:06.004
YEAH. WE WERE REALLY CLOSE.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.176
WELL, YOU GET TO SEE
SOME OLD FRIENDS,

40:08.176 --> 40:10.739
MAYBE EVEN RECONNECT
WITH A FEW.
 MAYBE.

40:10.739 --> 40:14.783
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN HARD
FOR YOU TO NOT SEE BREE,

40:14.783 --> 40:16.845
BUT IT HAS MEANT A LOT TO ME.

40:16.845 --> 40:19.588
(sighs) MM.

40:19.588 --> 40:22.991
NICE COAT. IS IT NEW?
 YEAH. I JUST BOUGHT IT
THIS WEEK.

40:27.596 --> 40:30.599
SO THEN THIS LONG RED HAIR MUST
HAVE GOT ON IT PRETTY RECENTLY.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.606
(chuckles)
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

40:37.606 --> 40:39.608
I... TOOK JUANITA
TO A KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,

40:39.608 --> 40:42.440
AND I HUGGED A CLOWN.
 YOU HUGGED A CLOWN?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.213
HIS MONKEY DIED.
HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.616
SO YOU'RE OFF TO A FUNERAL,
HUH?

40:47.616 --> 40:48.617
(thud)

40:48.617 --> 40:50.579
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:50.579 --> 40:53.181
(unzips suitcase)
 DON'T--DON'T OPEN THAT!
I PACKED IT VERY CAREFULLY!

40:53.181 --> 40:55.554
I CAN SEE THAT.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.957
ONE, TWO, THREE BIKINIS.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.829
IS YOUR FRIEND
BEING BURIED AT SEA?

41:00.829 --> 41:03.692
STOP IT.
I'M GONNA BE LATE.

41:03.692 --> 41:05.694
LATE FOR WHAT?
WEEKEND GETAWAY WITH BREE?

41:05.694 --> 41:07.766
DAMN IT, GABY.
I FORBADE YOU TO SEE HER.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.699
WELL, THAT WAS YOUR FIRST
MISTAKE. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

41:10.699 --> 41:13.171
I EXPECTED YOU TO CHOOSE ME!

41:13.171 --> 41:16.545
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
WE MOVED TO THIS STREET,

41:16.545 --> 41:20.478
AND--AND YOU GOT SO TIGHT
WITH THOSE WOMEN,

41:20.478 --> 41:22.781
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
YOU PUT THEM FIRST.

41:22.781 --> 41:25.614
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

41:25.614 --> 41:28.016
PROVE IT.

41:28.016 --> 41:29.688
CHOOSE.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.791
WHO DO YOU WANT
IN YOUR LIFE--ME OR BREE?

41:32.791 --> 41:34.663
DON'T DO THIS.

41:34.663 --> 41:37.265
I AM DOING IT, GABY.

41:39.868 --> 41:42.500
CHOOSE.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.705
YES, THE RESIDENTS
OF WISTERIA LANE

41:46.705 --> 41:49.538
ARE NOTHING IF NOT LOYAL,

41:49.538 --> 41:52.210
BUT THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THAT LOYALTY

41:52.210 --> 41:54.212
IS PUT TO THE TEST...

41:56.214 --> 41:59.588
BY THE DESIRE TO HELP
A STRICKEN FRIEND...

42:01.720 --> 42:06.655
BY THE NEED TO PROTECT
A LONG-BURIED SECRET.

42:08.757 --> 42:14.232
BY THE MOVEMENT OF TWO LIVES
IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

42:16.735 --> 42:22.540
AND SOMETIMES JUST AS ONE TEST
OF LOYALTY ENDS...

42:22.540 --> 42:23.672
ANOTHER BEGINS.

42:23.672 --> 42:26.675
GABY, I THOUGHT WE SAID
WE'D MEET AT THE SPA.

42:26.675 --> 42:30.078
LITTLE CHANGE OF PLANS.
CARLOS KNOWS.

42:30.078 --> 42:31.720
ABOUT US?

42:31.720 --> 42:35.123
YEAH. CAN I STAY WITH YOU
FOR A WHILE?

42:35.123 --> 42:36.785
OF COURSE.

42:36.785 --> 42:39.958
(whispers) THANK YOU.

42:39.958 --> 42:42.560
GIRLS, COME ON. GO ON IN.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.563
(sighs)
