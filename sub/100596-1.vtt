00:06.320 --> 00:08.560
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:35.800 --> 01:39.160
<i>There are three types of person:</i>

01:39.840 --> 01:42.040
<i>Those at the top,</i>

01:42.120 --> 01:43.640
<i>those at the bottom,</i>

01:44.320 --> 01:45.520
<i>and those who fall.</i>

02:26.000 --> 02:28.160
Level 48.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.440
-The hole.
-Yes.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.320
The hole.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.000
And it's the start of the month.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.280
So the question is:

02:46.360 --> 02:47.800
What are we going to eat?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.880
What are we going to eat?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.800
Obvious. The people above's left-overs.

02:56.880 --> 03:02.160
-Who are the people up above?
-The people on Level 47. Obviously.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.360
My name's Goreng.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.120
Please stay on your side of the hole.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.280
Goreng.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.480
What name have they given you?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
Yes.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.320
We should know each other's names.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.520
We'll be together for a long time.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.320
Or maybe not.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.680
Who knows?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
My name is Trimagasi.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.200
Mr. Trimagasi, do you know
what the hole entails?

04:54.280 --> 04:56.880
It's obvious: eating.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.080
At times, it's easy,

05:00.160 --> 05:01.960
others, difficult...

05:02.040 --> 05:03.960
It depends where you're assigned.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.200
Fortunately, No. 48 is a good level.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.680
Are there many more people below?
Don't tell me...

05:14.720 --> 05:16.080
It's obvious.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.160
Soon, there will be fewer of them.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.440
-You, down there! Can you hear me?
-Don't speak to the people below.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.440
-Why?
-Because they're down below.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.800
The people above won't answer you.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.960
-Why?
-Because they're above, obviously.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.720
You think it's all very obvious.
You must have been here a long time.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.880
Months. Many, many months.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.640
And I repeat, 48 is a good level,

05:48.720 --> 05:51.160
and you've been very lucky.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.760
And how long are we going to spend
on this wonderful level?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.160
We'll be here for exactly a month.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.720
Then, we will see.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.440
That's the last question I'll answer.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.280
Speaking tires me out.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.440
Especially when I have to give
more information than I get.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.080
That's not fair, obviously.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.080
From now on,

06:12.160 --> 06:15.480
I will give you as much information
as you give me.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.320
The red light went off
and the green one came on.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.080
I've just given you information.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.160
Now, it's only fair for you
to give me some, right?

06:38.400 --> 06:40.880
Why did the red light go off
and the green one come on?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.120
This food has already been eaten.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.560
That's so obvious,
I won't even say "obviously."

07:14.640 --> 07:16.360
It's disgusting.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.680
Let's see.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.120
If there are 47 levels above us
and two people per level,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.440
are we eating 94 people's left-overs?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.160
Don't worry.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.520
As the month goes by,
there'll be fewer people up above.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.280
-Aren't you going to eat?
-I'm not hungry.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.720
You will be.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.880
Why did you say there'd be
fewer people next month?

07:45.960 --> 07:48.880
I won't say it's obvious,
because it's not.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.800
I didn't understand myself
till I was on Level 8.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.520
Wine!

07:54.080 --> 07:58.640
There must be quite a few Muslims
and teetotalers up there.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.840
Normally, the drink's all gone by now.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.440
Are you really not going to eat?

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
For later.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.040
Why did you do that?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.520
For the people down there to eat.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.360
What if the people above did the same?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.760
They probably do.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.160
Bastards.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.600
-Isn't it very hot in here?
-And it'll get even hotter.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.200
Hotter?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.640
We'll be burned to a cinder.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.440
Really? Why?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.120
It's your fault.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.760
The temperature will keep rising
unchecked unless...

09:06.600 --> 09:09.720
-Unless what?
-Unless you get rid of that apple.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.680
The food only belongs to us
while the platform is on our level.

09:13.760 --> 09:18.280
If you keep anything,
the temperature rises till we're cooked.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.400
Or falls till we freeze.

09:21.000 --> 09:21.840
It depends.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.760
Shit.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.880
Do you understand?

09:37.720 --> 09:39.560
I said, do you understand?

09:39.960 --> 09:40.880
What?

09:42.440 --> 09:46.600
Once you're inside, you can't get out
till the agreed period is over.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.800
So, I've been accepted?

09:50.520 --> 09:51.640
Not yet.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.480
Can my item be a book?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.120
It can be whatever you want.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.680
THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN
DON QUIXOTE

10:20.000 --> 10:21.920
I'd like to tell you why I'm here.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.000
What for?

10:24.560 --> 10:27.080
So that then you'll tell me
why you're here.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
It's obvious.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.160
I wanted to quit smoking
and read <i>Don Quixote.</i>

10:33.960 --> 10:37.080
They said I could bring an item.
So, I thought I've never...

10:37.160 --> 10:38.800
You came here voluntarily?

10:42.800 --> 10:45.520
Six months in exchange
for an accredited diploma.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.040
An accredited diploma?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.600
An accredited diploma?

10:53.760 --> 10:56.040
I should get two.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.480
I came for a year.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.840
Why are you here?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.440
They give this guy one, and not me.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.360
I'd stand back if I were you.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.360
-Aren't you going to eat today either?
-Obviously not.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.200
What a waste!

12:06.920 --> 12:08.680
You don't deserve to be on this level.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.760
You haven't told me why you're here.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.120
Come on. Tell me.

12:26.040 --> 12:31.400
Only if you promise
not to borrow the word "obviously" again.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.560
I was at home, and an ad came on TV.
A bearded chap with a knife-sharpener.

12:42.640 --> 12:48.080
"The Samurai-Max sharpens any blade,
straight or serrated," he said.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.720
"Look at this knife.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.320
It's so blunt, it wouldn't cut a sponge.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.480
But just apply the Samurai-Max,

12:56.560 --> 13:00.000
and you can cut even the hardest surfaces,
like this brick.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.560
And it was true. He cut it.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.880
Then, a few housewives came on,

13:12.960 --> 13:16.960
saying how the Samurai-Max
had changed their lives.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.600
"We could never cut tomatoes,

13:20.680 --> 13:23.320
bread fell to pieces when we cut it.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.680
The Samurai-Max changed our lives,"
they all said.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.960
Honestly, I've never peeled a tomato,

13:31.040 --> 13:33.120
and I always buy sliced bread.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.080
And I've never known why you'd want
to cut a brick with a kitchen knife.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.120
But I started to think...

13:41.840 --> 13:44.160
Why don't I sharpen my knives?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.440
Maybe my life is such crap
because I don't sharpen my knives,

13:47.520 --> 13:49.160
don't look after the little things.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.520
-The little things, Goreng.
-Did you buy it?

13:53.600 --> 13:56.360
-Obviously.
-And what did you do?

13:56.440 --> 13:59.760
Sharpen your knives and slice open
someone's throat, or what?

14:03.680 --> 14:07.240
After I bought it,
I watched the next advertisement.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.160
The same guy with the beard
came on with the same housewives.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.240
Know what they were advertising?

14:13.960 --> 14:18.920
A knife that didn't go blunt
even if you cut a brick with it.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.320
The knife sharpened itself, as it cut.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.360
Know what the knife was called?

14:27.080 --> 14:29.840
-The Samurai-Plus.
-You bought it too?

14:30.240 --> 14:33.200
-No, no...
-Obviously, they were taking the piss.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.200
The little things...

14:36.400 --> 14:39.080
Because of the little things,
I couldn't take it anymore.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.960
I took my television set...

14:43.040 --> 14:44.640
and threw it out the window.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.840
It fell on some bloody illegal immigrant
on his bicycle.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.320
Tell me, was that guy's death my fault?

14:52.120 --> 14:54.080
He shouldn't even have been there.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.680
You killed a man, and they took you here?

15:01.760 --> 15:05.160
They gave me a choice between
a psychiatric hospital and the hole.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.040
And I came here.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.000
They never offered me
an accredited diploma, though.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.360
How many levels are there?

15:17.440 --> 15:21.960
I don't know. But I know there are
more than 132, because I was there.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.520
One hundred and thirty two?

15:23.600 --> 15:25.360
And there were more below.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.640
-How much food gets to that level?
-None.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.080
You can't go without food for 30 days.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.760
I didn't say I didn't eat anything,

15:32.840 --> 15:34.720
just that no food got down there.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.120
And you can go without food
for more than 30 days.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.520
The problem is when you get assigned
to two lower levels consecutively.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.480
We need to tell the people up there.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.440
-What for?
-What do you mean?

15:46.520 --> 15:50.080
We can tell them to ration the food
and pass the message up to Level 46,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.120
and from there to Level 45...

15:53.640 --> 15:55.120
Are you a communist?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.160
It's fairer to ration out the food.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.920
Up there, they won't heed a communist.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.240
Then I'll start with down below.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.560
Hey! You in 49, can you hear me?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
Leave more wine next time, bastards!

16:11.680 --> 16:14.240
There's your wine, fuckers!

16:17.840 --> 16:20.880
The people below us are below us.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.200
-Next month they might be above us.
-Yes, and they'll piss on us.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.680
The bastards.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.920
I chose a book.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.960
What did you choose?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.320
It's obvious.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.960
The Samurai-Plus.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.840
Do you never get tired of doing that?

17:51.920 --> 17:53.280
It's incredible.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.840
The more I use it, the sharper it gets.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.360
-Was that a person?
-Of course it was a person.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.080
I hope he wasn't a teetotaler,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.640
because we're low on wine.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.960
On the upper levels,
you can eat anything you like.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.080
But you've nothing to look forward to.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.920
And a lot to think about.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.680
Is no one going to do anything?

18:50.040 --> 18:53.200
If I were you, I'd pray they keep us
on the middle levels.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.560
You look like the sort who'd jump
when they're up above

18:57.640 --> 19:00.440
and lack the guts when they're below.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.040
The guts to do what?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.280
Will you read your book to me tonight?

19:17.160 --> 19:19.120
These days, I can't get to sleep.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.120
I miss my television.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.160
What levels have you been on?

19:27.880 --> 19:29.760
I first woke up on Level 72.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.880
Then I was on 26,

19:33.960 --> 19:36.560
seventy-eight, 43,

19:37.280 --> 19:40.880
eleven, 79,

19:40.960 --> 19:44.280
thirty-two, 8...

19:45.440 --> 19:48.000
Last month, I was on Level 132,

19:48.880 --> 19:51.440
-and now, I'm here.
-Okay, and who were you with?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.280
because I gather you always wake up
with the same person.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.400
-Who were you with?
-Why do you gather that?

19:57.480 --> 20:00.920
Because you said we'd be together
next month. Who were you with?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.720
It doesn't matter. What matters is
that you have a self-sharpening knife,

20:06.800 --> 20:07.920
and your cellmate disappeared

20:08.000 --> 20:10.320
after you were on a level
that gets hardly any food.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.040
And you don't look like
you spent a month without food.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.600
The conclusion is obvious, isn't it?

20:15.680 --> 20:18.080
You promised not to use that word again.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.120
Obviously, you forgot
the fifth commandment.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.200
Obviously, you dined on your cellmate.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.560
Don't worry about her. Eat.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
-Is she injured?
-Nothing serious.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.360
Isn't that right, Miharu?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.320
You know her?

20:52.240 --> 20:53.880
She comes down every month.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.400
-Why does she do that?
-She's looking for her little boy.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.360
There are children in the hole?

21:13.480 --> 21:17.480
Well, well... So, you'd like to keep her
for a couple of days?

21:18.920 --> 21:21.000
I took you for a man of principles.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.240
I want to help her.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.440
I am helping her.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.920
In the hole, everyone's free to decide
what they want.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.320
She wants to go down.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.680
Know what she does each month?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.960
Before coming down on the platform,
she kills her cellmate.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.440
That way, there's a chance she might be
with her son the next month.

21:42.240 --> 21:46.440
I wouldn't be surprised
if that body you saw was her cellmate.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.040
I didn't kill anyone on Level 132.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.760
Quite simply, my cellmate
completed his time in the hole.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.320
He'll be out there now,
making it big with his accredited diploma.

22:02.040 --> 22:06.120
After eight days, a body fell
just when the platform was at our level.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.360
We ate human flesh.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.720
But we didn't kill anybody.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.040
Hey!

22:30.320 --> 22:31.920
Hey! Hey!

22:32.360 --> 22:34.040
Leave her alone, you bastards!

22:34.120 --> 22:36.960
They'll only keep her a couple of days.
Don't meddle.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.000
-Will you read from your book tonight--
-Hey!

22:41.920 --> 22:44.720
Go ahead! Jump!

22:44.800 --> 22:47.120
It's only six or seven meters down.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.320
What chapter do you want me to read?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.280
Chapter One, obviously.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.720
Jesus!

23:24.400 --> 23:27.520
"Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place
whose name I do not care to remember,

23:27.600 --> 23:30.800
a gentleman lived not long ago,
one of those who has a lance

23:30.880 --> 23:33.640
an old shield, a nag and a racing dog."

24:42.760 --> 24:44.440
Do you believe in God?

24:48.280 --> 24:49.720
Why do you ask?

24:51.000 --> 24:54.480
If you do, I want you to pray for us.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.720
Smell that?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.240
It's gas.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.440
In a moment, they'll put us to sleep.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.240
Tomorrow, we'll wake on another level.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.640
I'm fond of you, Goreng.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.360
I don't think you'll survive long.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.680
But I'm fond of you.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.280
You've got a good heart.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.120
Next month will be my second-to-last.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.600
When I get out,
I should have an accredited diploma.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.960
And that's no small matter.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.040
Do you believe in God?

25:40.360 --> 25:43.840
This month, yes.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.160
You sleep very soundly, Goreng.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.720
Don't worry, don't worry.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.440
Calm down.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.640
This is not a good place.
Do you understand now?

26:29.480 --> 26:32.240
You're younger and stronger than me.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.120
You might not attack me immediately,

26:36.640 --> 26:39.560
but over time,
you'd start to look at me differently.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.080
Hunger unleashes that madman in us.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.840
It's better to eat than be eaten.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.760
Obviously, I don't want to kill you.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.840
Your flesh would soon rot,

26:53.920 --> 26:56.120
and we'd have nothing to eat.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.720
Nor will I mutilate you right away.

27:00.200 --> 27:04.120
For the first week, fasting is bearable.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.800
Have you ever eaten snails?

27:11.280 --> 27:13.440
Refined people call them escargots.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.120
They're highly prized in some places.

27:16.640 --> 27:20.040
Before you eat them, you have
to purge them for seven to ten days.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.080
So, there's no need to be scared. Yet.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.600
Can you hear that?

27:33.160 --> 27:35.040
The screams of people waking

27:35.760 --> 27:38.000
to discover what level they're on.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.440
You don't have to do this, Trimagasi.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.840
As time goes by,
our friendship would deteriorate.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.720
And it would end in mutual mistrust,

27:56.800 --> 27:59.640
ultimately leading to conflict and crime.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.200
I know, because I've experienced it.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.920
You're a fucking murderer.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.440
No. I'm someone who's frightened.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.520
I don't enjoy this, my little snail.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.160
I'm not a fucking snail.

28:17.240 --> 28:20.960
I'm sorry. It's easier for me
to think of you as a snail

28:21.040 --> 28:23.400
purging its impurities.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.800
You see, I'm really quite sentimental.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.520
See that?

28:39.200 --> 28:42.400
They haven't even left us any bones!

28:46.120 --> 28:47.560
Let's see, my little snail,

28:47.640 --> 28:50.240
you're tied down. I'm not.

28:50.320 --> 28:54.440
You have a book. I have my Samurai-Plus.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.760
Obviously, you're in no position
to make demands.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.440
But if you cooperate,

28:59.520 --> 29:02.040
I can offer you a chance to live.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.920
You can't mutilate someone here
without killing them, you bastard.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.200
I promise, I'll do what I can.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.360
After eight days, I'll start cutting off
little strips of flesh.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.800
Each time, I'll do my best
to treat your wounds.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.000
And I'll give you your share.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.480
A share of myself?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.280
Think of your own survival and help me.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
I hope you'll see reason,

29:28.040 --> 29:31.200
and we can go on reading <i>Don Quixote.</i>

29:31.280 --> 29:34.960
Let's see. That person's death
might have been an accident,

29:35.400 --> 29:37.000
but this isn't.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.560
You will be solely responsible
for my death, you bastard.

29:40.640 --> 29:44.320
No. The people above make me do it.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.800
Three hundred and forty people
are to blame before me.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.680
We can survive
just by drinking water, Trimagasi.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.080
You might last out,

29:53.840 --> 29:56.040
but I'm an old man.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.520
I need to remember that next month
will be my last one here.

29:59.600 --> 30:04.720
And if I survive... what happens
if we're sent to another bad level?

30:04.800 --> 30:07.840
-Now you get it, don't you?
-Obviously not.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.080
-Will you read <i>Don Quixote</i> to me tonight?
-Obviously not.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.760
In that case, that's an end to it.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.600
Speaking tires me out.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.240
Keeping quiet tires you out!

30:17.320 --> 30:18.720
Keeping quiet tires you out!

31:06.000 --> 31:08.160
The time has come, my little snail.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.200
I was trying to read...

31:12.040 --> 31:13.600
but I can't.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.080
The words get mixed up.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.840
My mind clouds over.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.240
Better for you if we start today.

31:26.360 --> 31:30.040
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
to make a clean job of it.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.400
I want you to know
that I hold you responsible.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.200
Not the people up above.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.560
Not the circumstances.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.000
Not even the Administration.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.720
You.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.760
You're well purged, my little snail.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.880
Inside and out.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.400
You don't even feel any resentment.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.360
Don't worry, just a few morsels of flesh.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.360
I won't touch your genitals.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.640
Are you ready?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.200
Thank you.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.280
What's your boy called?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.240
Eat...

37:15.760 --> 37:17.280
or be eaten?

37:21.440 --> 37:23.160
You made me.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.560
No.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.560
I was helpless and you showed no mercy.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.720
You didn't treat me with the same respect
I would have shown you.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.800
Obviously.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.400
Still using that word when you're dead.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.200
It smells of gas.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.640
And you're an illusion.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.480
Perhaps.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.080
What does it matter? We're the same now.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.680
Both murderers.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.640
The difference is that I'm more civilized.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.520
-Go.
-No. I'll never go.

38:08.360 --> 38:12.200
I belong to you now. I am in your body.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.800
But you belong to me too,

38:17.880 --> 38:19.360
my snail.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.080
Speaking tires me out.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.800
See? I was right.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.720
Ramesses II! Come here, honey.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.000
Animal! He was only being friendly.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.120
I'm Imoguiri. This is Ramesses II.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.600
Can you bring animals into the hole?

39:41.680 --> 39:44.080
There was no way
I was coming without him, Goreng.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.480
It's not a great idea
to bring a sausage dog in here.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.880
In here, he's more sausage than dog.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.200
I thought someone who chose a book
would be more sensitive with animals.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.600
No one ever brought a book before.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.560
People have asked for everything:
guns, crossbows,

40:00.200 --> 40:01.960
knives, torches,

40:02.040 --> 40:04.720
golf clubs, baseball bats...

40:04.800 --> 40:07.280
-even an exercise bike.
-How do you know my name?

40:09.400 --> 40:11.200
<i>You can smoke if you want.</i>

40:17.560 --> 40:20.400
-Shall we continue?
-Yes.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.360
Any gluten or lactose intolerance?

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
No.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.880
Any allergy to shellfish, peanuts,
or any type of fruit?

40:36.960 --> 40:39.200
Not that I know of.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.640
You know that once you go in,
you won't be able to smoke?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.320
Yes, I know.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.800
Are these pauses part of the interview?

41:20.680 --> 41:22.000
Do they make you uncomfortable?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.400
No.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.120
Your favorite food?

41:41.320 --> 41:42.400
I don't know.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.440
Think hard, please.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.360
Why do you want to know?

41:51.040 --> 41:52.760
We'll include it on the menu.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.080
So, I've been accepted?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.920
Not yet.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.600
Escargots à la Bourguignonne.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.440
Snails?

42:09.240 --> 42:11.440
-Yes.
-Okay.

42:12.360 --> 42:16.120
<i>-Can you get me out of here?</i>
<i>-You know I can't.</i>

42:17.080 --> 42:20.760
How many did you send to this pigsty
before they sent you?

42:21.480 --> 42:24.440
If I remember correctly,
you came here voluntarily.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.840
No one sent me. I asked to be sent too.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.160
So, you don't know
there are people dying in the hole?

42:31.240 --> 42:34.520
We prefer to call it
a Vertical Self-Management Center.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.640
How many levels are there?

42:43.040 --> 42:44.560
Two hundred levels.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.520
Two hundred?

42:53.160 --> 42:56.040
There isn't enough food for 200 levels.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.120
If everyone ate only what they needed,

42:59.800 --> 43:01.640
the food would reach the lowest levels.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.320
-No, it's not that easy in here.
-No, it isn't.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.680
Or on the outside.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.720
But eventually,
something has to happen in the VSC.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.440
Something that fosters
a spontaneous sense of solidarity.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.600
The VSC? Spontaneous solidarity?

43:16.680 --> 43:19.280
Is that why they created this pit?

43:25.280 --> 43:28.240
Change never happens spontaneously.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.600
Perhaps, that's why you're here.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.200
I'll be glad just to get out alive.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.440
That's it. Isn't that delicious?

44:22.520 --> 44:25.520
You know that what you're doing
could cause the death of a human?

44:25.600 --> 44:26.760
That's it.

44:27.960 --> 44:31.240
One day, I eat, and the next, he does.
It's my ration.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.400
Maybe the death of a child.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.120
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

44:41.240 --> 44:42.960
There's at least one child.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.480
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.600
The VSC Administration
is very strict about that.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.000
Good morning.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.080
Please listen carefully.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.400
I've left two helpings to one side

45:07.480 --> 45:09.000
so you can each eat your share.

45:09.080 --> 45:12.120
Please prepare two similar rations
for the people on the next level.

45:12.200 --> 45:16.840
What? We've just been in Level 88.
It's a miracle we're alive!

45:16.920 --> 45:19.280
I understand, but we have
a responsibility to those

45:19.360 --> 45:20.960
less fortunate that us this month.

45:21.040 --> 45:24.000
Your rations contain enough calories
to ensure your survival.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.800
Please, gentlemen!

45:34.840 --> 45:36.480
Spontaneous solidarity.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.600
Perhaps this place exists precisely
for the opposite of what you think.

45:42.680 --> 45:48.000
If that solidarity emerged, they'd know
to prevent it happening on the outside.

45:48.080 --> 45:50.520
-Who's "they"?
-Who do you think?

45:53.640 --> 45:55.040
The Administration.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.920
You're one of those people who thinks
all the Administration does is bad.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.040
I've worked for them for 25 years.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.600
And you enjoy special privileges.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.840
-What are you saying?
-You got to choose your cellmate.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.720
Not me.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.040
Gentlemen, I understand
you were hungry yesterday,

46:38.120 --> 46:39.840
and you didn't pay any notice to me.

46:39.920 --> 46:43.880
But it's important you only eat
the helpings I've prepared.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.960
And make two more for Level 35.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.120
Leave us alone!

46:49.200 --> 46:51.200
We'll eat what we fucking like!

46:56.640 --> 46:58.360
Sooner or later, you will see reason.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.600
Are you real?

47:00.680 --> 47:04.200
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations</i>
<i>and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

47:07.160 --> 47:08.480
<i>Gentlemen, please,</i>

47:09.240 --> 47:12.040
<i>eat your rations</i>
<i>and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

47:14.280 --> 47:16.440
<i>Gentlemen, please.</i>

47:16.960 --> 47:20.440
<i>Eat your share</i>
<i>and prepare two similar rations...</i>

47:21.840 --> 47:25.760
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations</i>
<i>and prepare two similar ones...</i>

47:28.560 --> 47:30.880
<i>Gentlemen, I have prepared your rations</i>

47:30.960 --> 47:35.200
<i>and the rations for Level 35</i>
<i>to make things easier for you.</i>

47:35.280 --> 47:37.040
Please prepare two--

47:39.400 --> 47:42.240
Please, it's been two weeks.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.840
This time, please follow my instructions

47:44.920 --> 47:47.760
because there are people dying
beneath your feet.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.360
Do you understand me? People are dying!

47:51.160 --> 47:52.760
Okay, bastards.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.160
You do exactly what the lady says,

47:55.240 --> 47:57.640
or I'm going to shit
in your food every day.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.880
I'll mix it all up till there isn't
a grain of rice left untouched.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.080
Do you hear?

48:02.200 --> 48:03.840
You're going to eat shit every day.

48:03.920 --> 48:07.000
And now, go and say the same
to the bastards beneath you.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.000
Is that clear?

48:12.040 --> 48:13.120
Right.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.440
It seems to be working.

48:21.520 --> 48:22.600
Obviously.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.120
But it's not what I thought.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.000
I thought I'd persuade them.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.200
They're persuaded.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.320
With shit?

48:30.400 --> 48:32.960
Much more effective
than your spontaneous solidarity.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.600
Let's see if now we can persuade
the people up above.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.960
The people above won't listen to me.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.000
Why not?

48:42.080 --> 48:44.160
I can't shit upwards.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.560
Help me! Help me!

49:08.760 --> 49:11.120
Okay, calm down, calm down.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.880
It's the mother of the boy.

49:16.280 --> 49:18.280
The pillow, the pillow!

49:25.240 --> 49:26.560
Don't worry.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.440
Don't worry. It's okay.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.120
-What?
-So cold.

49:44.200 --> 49:45.840
It's cold.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.760
That's it.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.720
I'm cold, too.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.720
What's happening?

49:56.400 --> 49:58.800
Fucking dog. Come here!

49:58.880 --> 50:01.680
Bastard, come here! Let go!

50:49.800 --> 50:52.040
I hate you.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.800
You vile bitch!

50:53.880 --> 50:55.520
-I hate you!
-Hey!

50:57.000 --> 50:59.880
What? What?

51:18.600 --> 51:20.000
It's because of her son.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.040
Seriously? I don't know.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.800
I've never been a mother.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.360
Hey! Is this our helping for today?

51:31.440 --> 51:33.280
That's fucking ace, man.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.400
I selected that woman ten months ago,
and she came here alone.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.280
She has no father and no children.

51:40.360 --> 51:42.280
Her favorite dish is bibimbap.

51:43.120 --> 51:46.400
She's a movie actress.
She brought a ukulele.

51:46.480 --> 51:49.400
She wanted to look like Marilyn Monroe
in the film.

51:49.480 --> 51:51.160
She came into the hole on her own.

51:51.840 --> 51:53.440
You hear, Goreng?

51:54.200 --> 51:57.480
Completely alone.

52:01.640 --> 52:05.480
The bitch wanted to be
the Asian Marilyn Monroe.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.760
With her slit eyes, playing the ukulele...

52:08.840 --> 52:12.080
And now she's a crazed killer
looking for a non-existent child.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.920
A spontaneous act of solidarity.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.040
Solidarity covered in shit.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.680
This isn't a great place
for someone who likes books.

52:29.240 --> 52:32.000
I've worked for them for 25 years.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.680
For eight years,
I've sent people to this hell.

52:34.760 --> 52:37.760
I didn't know what I was doing,
because I didn't know.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.760
I swear I didn't know.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.800
Do you believe me, Goreng?

52:47.880 --> 52:49.840
You don't believe me, do you?

52:50.920 --> 52:53.680
Right now, I need you to believe me.

52:58.680 --> 53:03.640
Look at me, Goreng.
I fought cancer for three years.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.400
And the day I found out
I'd lost the fight...

53:08.760 --> 53:11.160
I applied to come here, to help.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.800
But you know something?

53:22.280 --> 53:24.280
That doesn't matter anymore.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.600
I don't care anymore.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.160
I don't care about anything anymore.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.560
Who the hell would bring a book here?

53:35.560 --> 53:39.760
Who the hell would bring
a fucking book here?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.240
Look, it's a miracle
nobody's touched the snails.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.080
Don't you want to eat something?

55:20.560 --> 55:22.400
I'll put a couple in each helping, okay?

55:30.360 --> 55:32.680
Imoguiri, why don't you eat a bit?

55:34.120 --> 55:36.800
It's Ramesses II's turn today.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.080
It's the last day, you should eat.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.320
We don't know where we'll be tomorrow.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.960
Aren't you going to take her down?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.960
You were her friend.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.040
Are you going to eat her?

56:55.120 --> 56:57.760
Of course you are, Goreng.
Why do you think I hung myself?

56:57.840 --> 57:01.160
It would have been much easier to jump,
like most people do.

57:01.240 --> 57:03.080
But I wanted to leave you a gift.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.400
My body.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.720
I want you to feed off my body, Goreng.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.760
I want you to digest it,
then flush it out like redeeming shit.

57:11.840 --> 57:15.040
Remember: solidarity or shit.

57:15.120 --> 57:18.080
Do you think covering your ears
will do any good?

57:18.160 --> 57:20.840
We're inside your head, you idiot!

57:20.920 --> 57:23.280
Did you call him an idiot, idiot?

57:23.360 --> 57:25.080
You're talking to the Messiah.

57:25.160 --> 57:28.240
The Messiah of Shit,
but still the Messiah.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.840
-Eat me, Goreng.
<i>-The madwoman is right.</i>

57:31.920 --> 57:34.480
<i>It's your only chance of survival.</i>

57:34.560 --> 57:38.600
<i>That's right. Cut slices of my flesh</i>
<i>and eat my body.</i>

57:38.680 --> 57:40.000
Oh, Savior!

57:41.360 --> 57:42.800
<i>"Verily I say unto you:</i>

57:42.880 --> 57:46.440
<i>If you eat not the flesh of the Son of Man</i>
<i>nor drink of his blood,</i>

57:46.520 --> 57:48.160
<i>ye have no life.</i>

57:48.240 --> 57:50.360
He that eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood

57:50.440 --> 57:52.280
<i>hath eternal life.</i>

57:52.360 --> 57:54.720
<i>I will raise him up at the last day.</i>

57:55.760 --> 57:57.600
<i>For my flesh is meat indeed,</i>

57:57.680 --> 57:59.880
and my blood is drink indeed.

58:00.440 --> 58:03.000
<i>He that eateth my flesh</i>
<i>and drinketh my blood</i>

58:03.080 --> 58:04.680
<i>dwelleth in me,</i>

58:04.760 --> 58:05.720
and I in him."

58:07.040 --> 58:08.120
Amen.

59:28.240 --> 59:29.480
Here, Goreng.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.920
With a Samurai-Plus,
it was like cutting butter.

59:36.760 --> 59:38.080
Do it.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:03.640
Ears, cheek, jowl...

1:00:03.720 --> 1:00:07.720
breast, ribs, belly...

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:11.000
brisket, trotters, knuckle...

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:13.320
shoulder, ham...

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:15.320
loin, chops.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.880
You, up there! Bastards.

1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.800
Come on! I know you're there!

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:59.880
My name is Baharat, and I'm on fire!
You're here!

1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:02.080
Have you seen what level we're on?

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:03.920
Level six, my friend!

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.200
I'm on fire! I'm on fire! I'm on fire!

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.400
I can get to the top from here! Hey!

1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:11.280
You, in No. 5, answer me!
Come on, answer me!

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:14.360
-What's up? You want to come up?
-Yes, I want to come up.

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:16.640
-What do you want to come up for?
-What for?

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:19.320
To get out of this fucking hell!

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:23.320
-Do you believe in God?
-Yes.

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:25.760
Yes, I believe in God.

1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:29.000
But what God do you believe in?

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:31.800
In the One God.

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.000
In the One True God!

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.760
He says he believes
in the same God as us, darling.

1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:41.360
Come on!
I'm just passing through, I promise.

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.280
God told me to get out of the hole!

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:46.920
He says God has spoken to him.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.120
And what did he say exactly?

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:53.200
That two pious souls
would help me get out of the hole!

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:56.080
Did you hear that, darling?
I think God was talking about us.

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.480
And he will reward you for this!

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:04.320
And how will God reward us?

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.080
With everlasting life!

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:08.960
Everlasting life, no less!

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:11.560
Not a bad exchange
for helping a black man.

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:13.000
Come on, let me up!

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.600
Throw up the rope. We'll help you.

1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:25.360
Thank you, brothers! Praise the Lord!

1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:31.920
See you on the outside. Got it?

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:47.560
Help me!

1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:51.920
Help me!

1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.840
Bastards!

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:03.000
Pigs!

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.480
The bitch shat on me!

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.200
Pray for a rope to your God!

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.320
The rope! My rope!

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:16.280
You're fine. Be optimistic.

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:18.160
You're screwed.

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:21.720
You're screwed!

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:25.320
Five, five...

1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:29.400
You'll never get that close.

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:32.440
Five fucking levels!

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.960
You're adapting very well, my snail.

1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:53.720
I attacked you.

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:56.800
The mad witch committed suicide.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:00.760
Now, you can recover fully in this level,

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:02.640
eating everything.

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.160
You'll have just one more month

1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:10.120
before you get out with your diploma.

1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:13.480
See? It wasn't that difficult.

1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:17.320
It's just up to you now...

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:20.560
just you.

1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:27.280
Change never happens spontaneously, ma'am.

1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:30.760
Maybe that's why you are here.

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.280
Help me down.

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:55.000
We use whatever weapons we can.

1:05:56.200 --> 1:06:00.240
We get onto the platform and hand out food
at every level, just enough to survive.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:03.880
What?

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:06.640
I can't manage it on my own...

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.120
but we can do it together.

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.360
Together, we have a chance, Baharat.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:17.760
I'll try getting up next month.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:22.440
There'll always be some bastard
who won't let you past.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:25.240
Going down is suicide.

1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:29.240
If we can get food to the last level,
we'll have broken the machinery.

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:32.680
The hole doesn't have machinery.

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:35.000
The hole is the hole.

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:37.400
The hole is a prison.

1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:41.240
We don't know how many levels there are.

1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:44.400
When I was at Level 202,
I counted, second by second,

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:47.760
the time the platform took
to come back up.

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:49.240
It's not very exact,

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:52.440
but by calculating the time
the platform stops at each level...

1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:57.720
I reckon there are around 250.

1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:02.720
-Two hundred and fifty?
-Two hundred and fifty.

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.520
What if you're wrong?

1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:11.320
What if we run out of food
and haven't got to the bottom?

1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:15.240
Then we stay on the platform
and go back up on it.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.200
Just like you wanted to.

1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:21.560
-Go down...
-To go up.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:24.720
Only a lunatic would leave Level 6.

1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:27.560
Or two lunatics on fire.

1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:58.160
You're ridiculous up there.

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:00.880
I hope they kill you both, assholes.

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:31.920
You! Get out of here!

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.760
Keep well back from the platform!

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.880
Baharat! What the hell are you doing?

1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:38.320
Relax, we're just passing through.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:42.000
-We'll give you your rations and go.
-No.

1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:45.400
-No?
-No.

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:47.640
The first 50 levels eat every day.

1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:49.400
We start handing out food on Level 51.

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:53.320
These two are friends of mine.
Two months ago, they helped me climb.

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:55.640
These two ate yesterday,
and they'll eat tomorrow.

1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:57.840
A day without food won't kill them.

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:01.240
No way! I'm on Level 7,
and I'm entitled to stuff my face.

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:03.120
I nearly died last month on Level 114.

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:05.200
Where were you then, you bastards?

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:06.880
Then, you should understand.

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:08.880
What are you? Some sort of Messiah?

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.440
A Messiah who has come to save us?

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:14.520
A Messiah would multiply the loaves
and fishes, not take them from our mouths.

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:18.120
This is crap, Baharat. Christ!

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:19.680
I didn't expect this of you.

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:23.960
Who are you?
The black servant of a white man?

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.000
You! Get into the fucking corner!

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:40.640
Hey! I'll kill you!

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:43.080
Into the corner. Don't move!

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:47.360
Into the corner! Don't mess with me!

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:49.800
You! Drop that! Drop that!

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:52.640
On the ground! Don't move!

1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:54.360
Out! Or I'll crush you!

1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:56.720
You! If you come close, you're dead!

1:09:56.800 --> 1:09:57.880
Baharat!

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:04.960
Sorry, sir.

1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:08.080
Get off there right now!

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:11.600
You idiots are standing on the food.

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:15.360
Who the hell is this guy?

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.880
A wise man.

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.120
Did I teach you nothing?

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.600
Sir, we are trying to make sure
that food gets to every level.

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:28.480
That's good.

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:34.040
Very good. But manners come first.

1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:37.040
Win them over before you hit them.

1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:39.840
Sure, but what if we can't?

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:43.920
Then, hit them hard.
But dialogue must come first.

1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:46.480
However...

1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:51.560
who up there will know if you succeed?

1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:55.360
The Administration?

1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:01.720
The Administration has no conscience.

1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:06.120
However, there is a slim chance

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.800
the people working on Level 0 do.

1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:13.000
That's where you must send your message.

1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:15.280
And how do we do that?

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:30.680
With a symbol.

1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:34.040
We need a delicious,

1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:38.520
perfectly presented dish.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:43.400
A luxury dish
that gets back to Level 0 untouched.

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:53.840
<i>Imagine their faces</i>

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.680
<i>when they see the hole send back</i>
<i>a dish like that.</i>

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:03.680
<i>Then they will understand the message.</i>

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.320
<i>The panna cotta.</i>

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:12.240
<i>You must preserve the panna cotta,</i>
<i>as if your life depended on it.</i>

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.880
<i>The panna cotta is the message.</i>

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:20.640
Friends,

1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:24.680
I ask you please not to approach
the platform.

1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:27.080
We want you to join

1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:29.200
a peaceful protest movement

1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.520
that will inexorably change
the course of events

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:34.400
and set an important precedent--

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:36.520
What? Speak properly, asshole!

1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.240
-We want you to go hungry for a day.
-A day without food?

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:40.680
Yes.

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:44.280
Fuck that!

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.120
The important thing is the message.

1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:06.440
Out!

1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:19.600
Another couple of levels,
and we start handing out food.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:20.600
Back!

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:26.720
We don't want trouble, friends.
We're just passing through.

1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:29.680
We'll give you your ration and go.

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:07.760
-He's going to die.
-Not if you look after him.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.680
He's going to die anyway.

1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:13.320
I'll smother him with the pillow.

1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:17.920
Eat up and don't talk nonsense.

1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:21.960
I'll slit open his belly,
and I'll eat what you've given him.

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:37.400
Jesus!

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.520
This must be where Miharu woke up.

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:42.200
-The mother of the child?
-That child that doesn't exist.

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:43.240
Fuck.

1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:45.000
Shit.

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:49.000
Shit! Shit!

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:51.600
The platform didn't stop.

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:55.680
That means there are more levels
than you counted.

1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:02.080
Shit...

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:05.480
If there's nobody alive,
the platform doesn't stop.

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:09.120
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.760
Miharu! Miharu!

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:30.960
She's dead.

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:34.720
No! No!

1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:36.240
She is dead!

1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:39.040
The platform! Let's go!

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:41.360
Let's go!

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:43.360
The platform!

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:11.080
Get back!

1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:58.400
Be strong.

1:17:58.480 --> 1:17:59.680
Be strong.

1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:03.400
Be strong.

1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.120
There's nothing left.

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:15.160
Just the panna cotta.

1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:24.360
We still have the panna cotta.

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:30.360
The panna cotta is the message.

1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:34.760
The panna cotta is the message.

1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:37.600
The panna cotta is the message.

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:42.440
The panna cotta is the message.

1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:08.400
There's nobody here.

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:12.360
The platform's stopped.

1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:16.120
It must be the last level.

1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:19.960
Get ready. We'll go up now.

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.280
The child...

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:38.480
No.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:46.320
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:02.600
No, no, no, no! Fuck! Fuck!

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:18.400
Throw out the panna cotta.

1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:22.120
-Throw out the panna cotta.
-No.

1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:24.080
Throw out the fucking panna cotta.

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.120
No, no, no, no!

1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:28.400
Wait.

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:30.760
Wait.

1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:36.400
It's not hot.

1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.000
Or cold.

1:21:58.320 --> 1:21:59.760
It's a girl.

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:13.000
She's hungry.

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:22.360
Give her a bit.

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:29.960
No.

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:33.320
The panna cotta is the message.

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:35.680
The panna cotta is the message.

1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:37.560
The panna cotta is the message.

1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:39.880
The panna cotta is the message.

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:41.800
The panna cotta is the message.

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:44.160
<i>"A great man who is sin-ridden</i>
<i>can only be a great sinner,</i>

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:47.200
<i>the wealthy man who is not generous...</i>

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:51.280
<i>will be a miserly beggar.</i>
<i>The owner of wealth is not made happy</i>

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.640
<i>by owning it, but by spending it,</i>
<i>and not by spending it capriciously,</i>

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.040
<i>but by knowing how to spend it well."</i>

1:23:57.960 --> 1:23:59.200
What do you want?

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:02.760
I like listening to you read.

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:07.120
"Knowing how to spend it well."

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:12.480
You were very daring to squander
the bounties of Level 6, my little snail.

1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:15.520
-I didn't squander it.
-What now?

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:17.960
Will you eat the black guy?

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:21.640
Why not the girl?

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:25.760
The girl has a gift. Haven't you realized?

1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:33.200
Ramesses is the message.

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:34.960
Ramesses II is the message.

1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:38.800
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:41.760
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.960
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:46.960
Hey! Wake up!

1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:50.120
The girl is the message.

1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:51.960
She is the message.

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:05.040
She's the message.

1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:13.120
Baharat...

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.320
"Together, we parted,
and together, we peregrinate.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.800
One luck and one fortune we shall share."

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:05.480
Your journey is over, little snail.

1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:14.480
Not yet.

1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:18.880
-I've got to go back up with the girl.
<i>-</i>But you are not the message.

1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:22.720
But I'm her bearer.

1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:25.360
The message requires no bearer.

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:42.040
Don't call me little snail again.

1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:44.520
Don't use my word again.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:13.320
She will succeed.

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:17.200
She is the message.

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:19.840
She is the message.
