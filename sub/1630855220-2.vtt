WEBVTT

00:20.320 --> 00:22.280
We'd have reduced
the chances of being caught

00:22.280 --> 00:24.000
by the police
if we'd left him on the road.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.960
Forget the damn police! This is more
than just running someone over, dude.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.280
I know,
it's a fucking punishment from God. Like...

00:35.960 --> 00:38.320
- There's an opportunity here.
- Huh?

00:38.920 --> 00:42.360
Didn't Carlinhos say that the owner
of the drugs would be looking for them?

00:45.520 --> 00:48.160
- You think this guy's capable of looking--
- Sílvia, for fuck's sake.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.800
We killed someone!

00:50.400 --> 00:54.040
Was there a crosswalk there? Was there?
I didn't see one, did you?

00:54.040 --> 00:56.040
Because there was no crosswalk!

00:56.040 --> 00:58.880
Fuck him! This guy was talking on a phone
and threw himself into--

00:58.880 --> 01:00.760
Fuck! Shut the fuck up!
What do you want to do?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.040
What's your brilliant idea, huh?

01:03.040 --> 01:06.840
Go to the police and say we killed a guy,
brought him into a shed full of cocaine?

01:06.840 --> 01:08.560
I can't be arrested. I'm famous.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.520
Rafael, no one will fucking find out!

01:11.520 --> 01:14.080
But I also don't want
to go to hell for it, brother.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.160
You're not going to hell. Calm down,
brother. You're not going to hell.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.480
Look, listen, you're not going to hell.
It isn't your fault.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.960
I really need you, listen to me.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.240
- I don't want to go to hell, brother.
- You won't go to hell, I promise you.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.000
I swear you're not going to hell.
Now please stop. Please stop it, okay?

01:35.080 --> 01:37.800
We cut him into pieces
and feed him to the sharks.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.400
I can't do it! I can't fucking do it!

01:56.560 --> 01:57.680
Ah, I can't do it.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.480
Fuck! I can't do it.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.320
- Fuck, I can't.
- For fuck's sake. Ah, man.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.200
Jesus Christ.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.720
Oh, fuck.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.600
No, no! Stop!

02:22.520 --> 02:23.800
I thought of something.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.200
Huh?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.880
- What the hell? It's not sinking.
- I see that.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.840
We're gonna arrest him right in the act.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.320
What's your deal?

04:26.320 --> 04:28.480
POLICE

04:38.000 --> 04:41.120
On the ground!
On the ground now! On the ground!

04:41.120 --> 04:43.520
- On the ground, now!
- Hands up!

04:43.520 --> 04:46.600
Slowly, show me your hands.
No sudden movements.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.440
Get on the fucking ground!

04:48.440 --> 04:49.840
On your stomach!

04:49.840 --> 04:52.200
- Do it, man!
- Okay, <i>calmo. Calmo.</i>

04:52.200 --> 04:53.840
- Lay down!
<i>- Capite, calmo.</i>

04:58.760 --> 04:59.960
No sudden movements.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.920
I'm here. Sorry I'm late.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.720
Where were you?

05:31.680 --> 05:32.720
Tell you later.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.520
<i>This is the story
of a young man with high hopes</i>

05:45.520 --> 05:47.560
<i>in a place where hope never existed.</i>

05:48.800 --> 05:49.880
<i>And I should know.</i>

05:50.520 --> 05:52.720
<i>I was born here, just like Eduardo.</i>

06:18.600 --> 06:21.480
TURN OF THE TIDE

06:21.480 --> 06:23.640
If you blow here, it makes music.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.600
Here it is, Mr. Arruda.
I can't find any more.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.040
Mmm.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.640
Go over there and get an ice cream.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.360
- Can I take two, Mr. Arruda?
- One brick, one ice cream.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.920
Plus this brick has a hole in it.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.680
You're lucky I don't slap
your silly face, you fucking kid.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
<i>She seems to be
a different person, Father.</i>

07:32.960 --> 07:35.040
As if she has the Devil inside her.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.560
I no longer recognize my Sílvia.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.640
This is everything I found.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.840
I don't want any of this crap in my house.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.880
Take it. It stays here.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.480
Go in peace, my child.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.760
God is looking out for you
and your daughter.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.920
God? God has been
very distracted around here.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.560
That's what I think.

08:08.680 --> 08:13.520
Everything happens for a reason, Eduardo.
God has a plan for each one of us.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.120
When we sin, what happens?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.280
To sin is human.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.920
But forgiving is divine.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.480
Everything that happens, good or bad,

08:29.520 --> 08:30.480
is the will of God.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.760
His mercy is infinite.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.120
Thanks, Father. I mean it.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.680
That's what I had hoped.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.760
<i>God, the Devil.</i>

08:48.760 --> 08:50.960
<i>Could even be Mickey Mouse. Who cares?</i>

08:50.960 --> 08:52.960
<i>If life has always fucked you up,</i>

08:52.960 --> 08:56.960
<i>and suddenly 397 kilos of cocaine
falls in your lap,</i>

08:56.960 --> 08:58.560
<i>are you going to give it back?</i>

08:59.160 --> 09:02.360
<i>My boy Eduardo knew that it was time
to shit or get off the pot.</i>

09:03.640 --> 09:06.200
<i>The others didn't have
the same survival instinct.</i>

09:50.400 --> 09:53.200
<i>Some tried to escape
the guilt as fast as they could.</i>

09:54.840 --> 09:56.440
<i>Others tried to shut it up.</i>

09:58.480 --> 09:59.600
<i>Was it gonna hurt?</i>

10:00.400 --> 10:01.320
<i>You bet.</i>

10:17.160 --> 10:19.960
<i>To move on, Eduardo knew
that he had to send the guilt</i>

10:19.960 --> 10:21.440
<i>to the bottom of the ocean.</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:25.720
What's your problem, man?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.600
- What the fuck do you think?
- It was an accident, Rafael.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.000
We're not to blame for this.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.360
He threw himself on top of the car.
He killed himself, dude. Okay?

10:35.880 --> 10:38.520
And his family's in Italy,
they're not gonna fucking know.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.560
I see that fucking guy's face
every night, man--

10:40.560 --> 10:44.520
Listen, all right. I have nightmares, too.
But think about it for a second.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.040
Would you rather have nightmares
here or in prison? Hmm?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.160
Just trust me.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.760
Do you?

10:50.760 --> 10:53.640
We're in this together. Okay, dude? Okay?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.360
Yes? Come on. Let's go, come on.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.520
Sílvia, let's go.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.800
Come on.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.840
When this car sinks into the water,

11:26.040 --> 11:28.320
it'll also sink everything
that happened that night.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.520
We'll never speak about this again.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.800
Okay?

12:05.560 --> 12:10.120
<i>...Francesco Bonino has already
been apprehended by police forces.</i>

12:10.120 --> 12:14.080
<i>Sources from the judiciary police indicate
that reinforcements from the mainland</i>

12:14.080 --> 12:16.240
<i>have been deployed, based on the belief</i>

12:16.240 --> 12:19.360
<i>that there are other members
that will be apprehended soon.</i>

12:19.360 --> 12:21.720
Do you wanna go someplace? To a café?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.480
I have some stuff to do.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.520
What stuff?

12:26.240 --> 12:27.200
Girl stuff.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.000
- You can be alone for a little bit, right?
- And you?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.160
- I guess you have stuff to do, too?
- Yeah.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.440
And you're coming along.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.800
- Oh!
- It's strong, isn't it, bro?

12:41.400 --> 12:44.160
It's almost as strong as you are.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.760
So if you want to keep the four kilos,
that's the price, 20,000.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.160
Do I look like I eat shit
by the spoonfuls, or what?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.920
Eh, my friend, you know perfectly well
there's plenty of it out here.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.680
Bricks of powder, <i>de Italianos</i>.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.640
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

13:02.640 --> 13:04.080
- Chill, asshole.
- What the fuck?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.760
We can do a special price for you, okay?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.400
- One thousand. A thousand and we're good.
- A thousand?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.840
- A thousand euros?
- Yeah.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.960
- You told me this guy was smart.
- He is.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.440
Come on! Cut it out. Fuck.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.000
100 euros, is that okay?
100 euros, you keep all of it.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.240
Why didn't you
say that sooner, my friend?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.600
Uh...

13:29.280 --> 13:30.640
Ciao to you, Eduardo!

13:30.640 --> 13:31.760
Kiss to Carina.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.560
<i>My boy Eduardo was learning
the basic rules of supply and demand.</i>

13:40.200 --> 13:43.600
<i>What the guys with money
call "a misfit in the market."</i>

13:45.880 --> 13:48.920
<i>Let's look at the classic case
of the lemonade stand.</i>

13:48.920 --> 13:52.760
<i>If there's only one little girl
selling lemonade, it isn't gonna be cheap.</i>

13:52.760 --> 13:56.480
<i>But then her little friend thinks,
"Oh, what a great idea."</i>

13:56.480 --> 13:58.280
<i>So the price comes tumbling down</i>

13:58.280 --> 13:59.800
<i>until it's worth shit!</i>

13:59.800 --> 14:02.120
<i>And if it's like this with lemonade,</i>

14:02.120 --> 14:06.440
<i>it's no different with the most expensive
and addictive powder in the world.</i>

14:07.320 --> 14:08.800
I don't think I can do this.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.400
Mmm.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.680
Relax, babe. Hmm?

14:16.520 --> 14:18.160
I'm going to need something stronger.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.240
Want some?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.240
Let's fly the jacket in, Bruna.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.400
- Fly it in, Bruna. Fly, fly, fly, fly...
- Yeah.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.640
- This.
- Come on. Come on.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.120
- It's just putting on a jacket. Here.
- You've got some here.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.960
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.560
Let's get some clothes here.
Calm down. Wait, wait. Okay, better.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.800
Yeah, like that. Let's move your head
a little bit. Very good.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.240
- Where should I look?
- Oh, it's sea.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.720
- That way.
- It's sea, let's go, let's go. Yeah!

14:51.720 --> 14:54.320
Mmm. Pull up the skirt a little bit.
No, lower it. Like that.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.720
Just until we see a little white.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.000
I don't want to see panties.
Like there's nothing.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.680
In my mind, there aren't any, okay?

14:59.680 --> 15:01.760
Come on, put some music on. Come on!

15:04.920 --> 15:05.960
Over here.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.120
Yes, that's it! Right, turn around.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.480
Bite it!

15:38.280 --> 15:42.480
The first time I snorted,
I was at a Springsteen concert.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.960
1989.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.760
But little did I know...

15:50.280 --> 15:53.400
I started flying,
and I never looked back again.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.480
Never!

15:55.440 --> 15:58.520
Hey, girl, where'd you get
that blow you gave us?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.280
Huh?

16:00.280 --> 16:03.000
Rabo de Peixe, but don't panic.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.360
I'm going to buy all the powder you got.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.600
All the powder you've got.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.280
I'm gonna make you a rich fucking bitch.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.240
Fucking rich! I want it all.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're approaching an area of turbulence.</i>

16:24.040 --> 16:26.600
<i>We ask that you return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.</i>

16:26.600 --> 16:27.840
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
It's only the first three minutes.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.160
94% of airplane crashes happen
in the first three minutes of a flight.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.960
It's a lot more probable
you'll die from an attack by a shark

16:38.960 --> 16:40.600
or being bit by a poisonous insect.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.040
You know a lot, don't you?

16:43.640 --> 16:46.640
But nothing compared
to cardiac diseases and cancer, of course.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.040
One out of seven people die from that.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.840
One out of seven!

16:54.160 --> 16:55.720
Is that your father sleeping?

16:57.000 --> 16:57.960
Yeah?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.680
One, two,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.840
three, four, five,

17:05.440 --> 17:07.200
six, seven.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.680
- You sure we'll be fine?
- Let me do the talking.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.640
Hey, what's up, boys?

17:23.640 --> 17:26.480
Hey, look, my champion!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.520
Hey, get your ass out of there.
Come on, sit here.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.200
Come on, bring it in.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.440
And how are you, huh? Uh, Wednesday.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.120
Wednesday?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.840
Standing there in the middle.
Either come in or go fuck yourself.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.080
Come on, fucking get in here.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.720
Hey, fellas.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.560
I want to use the fact
that we are all here,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.840
and I want to thank you
right now for coming.

17:50.840 --> 17:51.760
Question.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.760
What happens when we get a lot of fish?

17:57.560 --> 17:58.920
- Hmm?
- The prices go down.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.560
The prices go down. Very good.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.320
And can you guess what happens
with a lot of Coca-Cola?

18:04.320 --> 18:07.200
We all get wasted
out of our fucking minds, dude.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.320
Right?

18:11.320 --> 18:12.240
Mmm.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.560
Right now, the streets
are full of white. Right?

18:17.080 --> 18:19.360
And it's just little pigeons
walking around,

18:19.360 --> 18:22.400
and pecking just about everything
like there's no tomorrow,

18:22.400 --> 18:23.560
and showing off.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.680
And who is it that likes little pigeons
a lot? Who is it?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.000
The old lady.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.800
No, pal, it's the fucking cops.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.080
The cops couldn't care less
about Rabo de Peixe.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.840
Ah, there you have it.
Wednesday's absolutely right.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.000
The cops couldn't care less
about Rabo de Peixe.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.560
But what happens if the little pigeons
start dying like flies, you know?

18:43.560 --> 18:44.720
What happens, hmm?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.400
Rabo de Peixe, my friends,

18:48.320 --> 18:49.760
hits the headlines.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.560
We are in the news, my friends,
and the cops come here,

18:53.560 --> 18:56.440
they clean up all this shit,
and we make nothing.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.600
And what do you want us to do?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.760
I assume stop selling it.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.440
Then we keep it at home to make bread?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.120
Shut up and listen to the man.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.520
What I want is for you,
each one of you, every single one of you

19:11.520 --> 19:15.360
to bring whatever you've fucking found
to this location.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.560
We're gonna sell everything from here.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.680
I get a cut,
and each one of you gets his share.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.720
It's the so-called win-win. Hmm?

19:24.720 --> 19:28.160
How do we know you won't keep the stuff
and tell us to go fuck ourselves?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.200
It's not like we can complain
to the police.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.240
Listen, uh, you piece of trash.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.760
How many of you here
have already been in prison?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.000
I was framed.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I was too, okay?

19:44.480 --> 19:47.720
And who at this table is dependent
on the unemployment subsidy?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.000
I thought so.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.320
I have a legitimate business,
no problems with the law.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.800
It's a take it or leave it deal.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.160
In other words, we all fuck...

19:59.120 --> 20:00.720
...or we throw the whore overboard, right?

20:02.760 --> 20:05.280
In this case, the whore
is your mother, you chicken ass!

20:05.960 --> 20:07.240
You leave my mother out of it!

20:07.240 --> 20:09.840
- Fuck you, you scumbag! Fuck you!
- Oh, come on. I was just joking.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.960
- We're just kidding around!
- I'm out of here.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.800
Go fuck your mother, douchebag!

20:29.240 --> 20:31.360
It'd be better for us
if we give the drugs to Arruda.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.600
No way I'm giving drugs
to that motherfucker. I'm not!

20:34.600 --> 20:35.520
I told you.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.440
He's such an asshole.
Call me fucking Wednesday?

20:38.440 --> 20:41.920
- Take it easy!
- He's just a fucking asshole. Fuck.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.760
We just have to find a place
to sell them ourselves.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.160
Somewhere with lots of cash and no drugs.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.560
- Right?
- I know a place where we can do that.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.360
Welcome to Azores.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.560
We've never had a specialist
in drug trafficking.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.200
Nothing ever happens here.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.920
<i>The morning rush.</i>

21:29.480 --> 21:31.920
<i>First thing you think about
when you wake up,</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:34.480
<i>and all you think about during the day</i>.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.480
<i>Rabo de Peixe was like Fifth Avenue
of the junkies and the toothless.</i>

21:39.840 --> 21:42.680
Here. Twenty euros, Skinny. Thanks, man.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.040
Skinny!

21:51.480 --> 21:54.160
Oh! What the fuck's going on?

21:54.160 --> 21:55.880
What are you doing here?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.840
You got this shit out in the open?

21:57.840 --> 22:00.760
How many times have I told you
not to sell that fucking shit here?

22:00.760 --> 22:03.000
Might as well build a shop
that says "The King of Coke,"

22:03.000 --> 22:04.880
so that every-fucking-body knows, dipshit!

22:04.880 --> 22:06.480
- Mr. Arruda--
-"Mr. Arruda," what?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.680
Gimme your hand.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.120
- Gimme your hand, moron.
- I'm sorry.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.120
Stupid fucking baker!
I said I want your hand! Give it here!

22:12.120 --> 22:14.240
- Mr. Arruda, you can take it.
- Not on my street!

22:14.240 --> 22:17.320
Never sell that fucking shit here!

22:17.320 --> 22:18.880
Okay?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.440
You understand?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.560
You hear me?

22:24.920 --> 22:26.160
Dumbass!

22:30.320 --> 22:32.400
I won't warn you again!

22:32.400 --> 22:36.160
I know it's the court's orders,
but I will do the questioning in Italian.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.360
If I need your help,
I'll ask you, huh? <i>Signorina</i> Fasulo.

22:41.840 --> 22:45.800
That's how we spend
the taxpayers' money in this country.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.760
Mmm. Well...

22:52.600 --> 22:55.120
Francesco Bonino, Italian.

22:57.800 --> 23:01.680
Giovanni Speranza,
also Italian.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.040
This is my favorite. Spanish.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.720
Juan del Cristo Guerrero Gómez.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Who are you?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.760
My name is Francesco Bonino.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.560
I was born in Piano di Sotto,

23:25.560 --> 23:27.200
Trapani province, Sicily.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.520
I'm a fisherman and a sailor.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.000
An islander,
just like me, hmm?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.960
I knew
we would understand each other.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.400
Now... So...

23:41.400 --> 23:43.440
In the boat,
besides two kilos of cocaine,

23:43.440 --> 23:45.760
we found passports with different names
and fake documents.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.440
Was he travelling alone?

23:47.440 --> 23:48.680
Yes and no, detective.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.120
Yes or no?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.480
When we questioned him,

23:52.480 --> 23:55.520
he said "<i>da solo</i>" in Italian.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.400
And we couldn't understand
if he meant he was traveling alone,

23:58.960 --> 24:00.720
or whether he liked his coffee black.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.120
But meanwhile, the translator
arrived today, sent by the court.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.720
From all indications,
there was someone else inside the boat.

24:12.720 --> 24:16.920
You questioned an international
drug trafficker without a translator?

24:16.920 --> 24:21.000
Chief Banha speaks a little Italian.
He studied three months in Bologna.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.640
- To the left. Yes.
- In here?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.320
You leave Venezuela

24:26.320 --> 24:28.400
with a sailboat loaded with cocaine,

24:28.400 --> 24:30.080
headed for the Canary Islands.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.920
The weather changes.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.400
The boat breaks down
in the middle of the Atlantic.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.280
You look at the map and think

24:39.280 --> 24:42.240
this would be a good place
to dump your crap.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.760
The question is,
how much crap did you bring,

24:47.760 --> 24:49.080
Mr. Francesco?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.760
Five hundred kilos?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.240
Maybe a little less.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.640
So,
we already found everything.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.920
Only crumbs
left for the fish...

25:21.920 --> 25:23.720
Where's the info on the boat?

25:30.560 --> 25:33.080
Would you risk crossing the Atlantic
on an almost-empty boat

25:33.080 --> 25:35.040
if you could bring 6,000 pounds?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.280
You still up?

25:53.120 --> 25:54.480
Eduardo, you in there?

25:54.480 --> 25:57.200
I'm-- I'm going out.
I'm going into town with Rafael.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.920
You smell like a brothel.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.440
It's to disguise the fish smell.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.360
I'm going to bed.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.320
- Don't waste water.
- Good night.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.280
- Good evening.
- Ah.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.280
- You can't go in.
- Why not?

26:33.280 --> 26:34.640
The flip-flops.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.720
I'll be back, okay?

26:36.480 --> 26:37.320
Okay.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.080
I get it.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.320
Ooh!

26:54.400 --> 26:55.880
Won't find a better deal.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.440
Hey!

27:03.440 --> 27:05.200
Finally, my boy!

27:05.200 --> 27:07.640
Thanks for gracing us with your presence.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.720
Sit here.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.400
What's up?

27:13.360 --> 27:14.880
You like those boots? Huh?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.120
- I appreciate it.
- They were my grandfather's.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
Yeah.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.400
His dead body was warm in the coffin
when I grabbed 'em.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.760
Those boots were his favorite.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.080
- Ian.
- Eduardo.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.840
Do you have more?

27:38.880 --> 27:40.000
Huh?

27:40.920 --> 27:44.400
Do you have more of those little baggies
Sílvia got for me?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.480
Whoa, oh, oh! Come on.
What, are you in pre-school, dude?

27:56.280 --> 27:58.360
Let's go. Inside, come on.

28:05.040 --> 28:08.280
- You have a lot of this one, right?
- Getting more won't be a problem.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.640
How much you got? Huh?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.720
- One hundred? Huh?
- More.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.960
More? Oh, wow!

28:19.520 --> 28:21.120
Five hundred?

28:21.800 --> 28:23.760
If you want, I have more than 500.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.040
-"If you want, I have more."
- Mm-hmm.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.200
Wanna fuck my ass?

28:33.720 --> 28:34.560
Huh?

28:36.160 --> 28:37.080
What?

28:43.360 --> 28:45.880
You don't want to fuck me, right? Huh?

28:45.880 --> 28:48.040
You came here
to fucking fuck me, motherfucker?

28:48.040 --> 28:49.040
- No, no.
- Huh?

28:49.040 --> 28:51.400
No, no, no. I'm not here
to fuck you, all right?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.160
I just-- I just want to sell my fish.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.880
Uh-huh.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.040
Okay.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.720
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

29:02.720 --> 29:04.480
Two. Hmm?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.320
- Two kilos?
- Shhh.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.280
Two what?

29:09.160 --> 29:12.120
- But you wanted two kilos, or...?
- Shhh. Let's go back to the party.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.840
- It's two kilos, right?
- Come on, let's go.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.000
- Two kilos, yeah?
- Party won't start without Ian.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.800
- You have to get tattoos.
- Huh?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.000
Watch and learn, my friend.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.240
- I mean it. Get something tribal.
- Please don't start.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.120
- You wanna get girls or what?
- Shut your mouth.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.760
- I just sold two kilos.
- You sold to Ian?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.120
He held his fingers up like this.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.320
- That's two kilos.
- Two kilos?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.000
Seriously, man, that's awesome!

29:53.880 --> 29:57.240
Hey, girl, pretty face!
So it's two shots of vodka with melon.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.000
The entrepreneur here is paying.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.400
- Here's my address.
- Huh?

30:06.360 --> 30:07.480
For Ian's order?

30:08.120 --> 30:09.120
Yeah, okay.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.920
But you can show up there
whenever you want.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.160
Shut up!

30:26.160 --> 30:27.880
- No bullshit, all right?
- Just some advice.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.240
- Jesus Christ.
- No, let me say it.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.200
Just because you're unloved doesn't mean
you can't get your brains fucked out.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.280
- Stop playing at matchmaker, all right?
- Sorry for trying to help you. Hold on.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.120
How long have you had
that passion for Sílvia?

30:38.120 --> 30:40.240
Hey, no! We're not going
to fucking talk about that.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.560
If you want to continue chasing her,
no problem.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.960
You know I'll support you.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.640
But we need to get some action
in your bed, right?

30:46.640 --> 30:49.240
Okay, man. Stop it, man. Let's drink!

30:49.240 --> 30:51.840
Come on, if you don't want to be happy,
at least have fun, man.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.120
- Or do you want to join a convent?
- Let's go, come on. Let's celebrate.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.280
If I didn't know you,
I'd say you were a virgin.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.760
You should ask your cousin about that.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.520
Wow. Now, since you don't fuck,
at least try dancing.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.040
Come on!

32:53.400 --> 32:55.200
- What?
- It smells like fish.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.920
And you call yourself a fisherman.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.320
I am, but I just wasn't expecting this.
It's going to stain my bag.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.120
- No, no, Rafael. Look, don't start that.
- Just for the road.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.600
No, no, no! Don't start.
I need you sharp, all right?

33:06.600 --> 33:07.680
God damn it.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.440
Oh, fuck.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.800
Okay. Ready?

33:45.240 --> 33:46.080
Oh, fuck!

33:52.280 --> 33:54.400
- Morning. We were looking for Bruna.
- She's here.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.360
She's my daughter. But who--

33:57.080 --> 33:58.520
Wait a minute. You--

34:00.400 --> 34:03.000
Wait a second. You're Rafael Medeiros?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.760
Yes. Yes, I am.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.040
Come in, Rafael!

34:08.040 --> 34:10.360
Rafael Medeiros in my house!

34:11.640 --> 34:15.640
Guys! Look, a celebrity is gracing us
with his presence.

34:15.640 --> 34:18.320
Santa Clara, number nine jersey,
in '97-'98 season.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.320
Excuse me,
is Bruna outside or is she--

34:20.320 --> 34:21.680
Uh, she must be asleep.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.760
Rafael, what do you want to eat?
Pork belly?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.000
I have some linguiça from Flores.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.280
Where's the bathroom?

34:27.280 --> 34:30.320
It seems like I'm not the only one
who doesn't know anyone here.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.520
Yeah.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.120
You gotta be kidding me.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.000
Fuck this.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.480
Fuck me!

35:25.920 --> 35:27.440
It's the only cold drink I could find.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.720
With this heat,
that's not gonna be a problem.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.400
- Can you point me to the bathroom?
- Second door.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
Got it.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.200
Wait a minute, it's busy.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.520
Come on! We have to leave,
Rafael, hurry up!

35:44.520 --> 35:47.360
- Can you fucking wait? Oh, fuck!
- No waiting! We have to leave, man!

35:54.200 --> 35:55.120
Is this the bathroom?

35:55.120 --> 35:56.520
Somebody's already in there.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.600
See if you can get a mop or something?
'Cause I spilled this shit everywhere.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.640
Come on, Rafael,
there are people waiting. Hurry.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.960
- It's all over the place.
- Shit.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.800
Come on,
there are people waiting.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.720
Bro!

36:07.400 --> 36:08.240
Thanks.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.480
You forgot your manners.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.560
Fuck, what a fucking nightmare.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.320
Fucking shit!

36:29.640 --> 36:31.320
Okay, okay.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.200
All yours.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.000
It was a goal
for the ages, right?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.960
For a second, I thought
Luz Stadium was coming down.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.120
- We have to leave, man. Come on.
- You're going? But you haven't eaten yet.

36:58.440 --> 37:00.680
Dad, we're going to the movies
and we're late, so...

37:02.520 --> 37:04.920
- Come on, let's leave.
- What are you doing? Bruna's here!

37:04.920 --> 37:07.600
We're at a cops' barbecue, fuckhead.
Let's go.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.440
- Have you lost your fucking mind?
- Hey, hey, guys!

37:16.240 --> 37:17.960
You're not leaving empty-handed.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.880
Here. Take these linguiças with you.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.800
- Thank you.
- Hold up. I'll need that Tupperware back.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.560
- I'll get it when I'm in Rabo de Peixe.
- Okay, sounds good.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.080
Rafael Medeiros, jersey number nine.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.160
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! I fell asleep.

37:48.160 --> 37:51.280
Save it! Your dad is a cop,
and you didn't think to tell us?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
Led us to the sharks
so we can be ripped apart?

37:53.280 --> 37:54.800
Tell your boyfriend no deal, Bruna.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.400
Oh, come on, Eduardo, wait!

37:56.400 --> 37:57.680
What the fuck?

37:57.680 --> 37:58.880
Fuck!

37:59.520 --> 38:00.440
Fuckers!

38:01.280 --> 38:02.120
Fuck!

38:04.160 --> 38:05.480
Fuck you, asshole!

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
Shit!

38:09.600 --> 38:12.400
Are you feeling
this adrenaline, bro?

38:13.600 --> 38:16.120
Huh? We were in a fucking cop's house,
carrying coke!

38:16.120 --> 38:18.480
- I can't go on with this shit, Rafael.
- What the fuck?

38:18.480 --> 38:20.400
- Those cops are fucking clueless.
- Listen, dude.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.600
We won't sell this shit anymore.
It's fucking over!

38:22.600 --> 38:25.600
Ah, bro, we've just begun.
Fuck! We're going to get rich quick.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.040
Rafael, a kid from Rabo de Peixe died
sniffing this shit. You understand that?

38:29.040 --> 38:32.200
"It's God's will, Rafael." That's what
you said. God's will, remember?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.440
That's what you said.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.520
Lately, there have been
a flood of overdoses.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.200
Tell the unit
we have an early start tomorrow.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.800
Do you have to make so much noise?

39:11.800 --> 39:14.200
Morning walk in Rabo de Peixe.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.760
Exactly what I needed on a Sunday morning.

39:16.760 --> 39:17.680
Right now?

39:17.680 --> 39:19.600
We're going in strong.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.160
Uh, I left you some food in the fridge.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.440
Much of the Italian's drugs
have yet to be seized.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.640
We have search warrants
to get into the houses,

39:36.640 --> 39:40.640
hidden spots underneath the houses,
sheds, attics, basements,

39:40.640 --> 39:43.160
containers, and dollhouses, everything.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.160
I want everywhere searched
with a fine-tooth comb.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.120
- Come on, Banha!
- Fuck.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.000
Hello?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.480
Just a second, please.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.040
Hey, Sílvia!

40:17.960 --> 40:18.880
It's for you.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.800
Come on!

40:22.840 --> 40:23.680
Hello?

40:23.680 --> 40:26.720
<i>Sílvia, the judiciary police
are coming to raid Rabo de Peixe.</i>

40:26.720 --> 40:27.640
Fuck.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.360
- They're on their way here.
- Eduardo, who is it?

40:54.360 --> 40:55.560
The police.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.760
Hands where I can see them!
On the ground, on the ground!

41:03.840 --> 41:05.600
- Police!
- Hey, hey!

41:05.600 --> 41:07.240
- What's going on?
- Turn around!

41:07.240 --> 41:08.320
Fuck!

41:12.720 --> 41:13.760
Get on the floor!

41:14.560 --> 41:15.400
Get down!

41:18.120 --> 41:19.400
Stop!

41:21.400 --> 41:22.960
Fuckers!

41:22.960 --> 41:24.680
You motherfucker!

41:24.680 --> 41:25.600
Ready.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.800
It's not mine, please!

41:38.640 --> 41:39.920
Fuck, come on, let's go!

41:57.240 --> 41:58.400
Eduardo!

42:00.920 --> 42:02.560
We have to stop,
we have to stop!

42:03.080 --> 42:04.600
Stop the boat!

42:27.280 --> 42:29.720
MARITIME POLICE

42:57.760 --> 42:59.680
Detective, nothing.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.280
Detective Banha.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.320
That backpack.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.200
This one?

43:28.600 --> 43:31.960
Sir, it's your container.
It's already been washed.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.120
All clear?

43:47.800 --> 43:49.040
Okay, let's go.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.480
Okay, Rafael, let's go.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.760
Ready to go? Yeah?

44:04.760 --> 44:05.720
Let's go.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.280
What is this, Detective Frias?

44:46.480 --> 44:49.480
Did you come here
to arrest children and senior citizens?

44:49.480 --> 44:52.600
Sir, we have to arrest the culprits,
no matter who they are.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.080
Did you see anyone selling?

44:55.080 --> 44:57.520
These drugs washed up ashore by accident.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.400
In the Azores, we don't make it a practice

45:00.400 --> 45:02.880
to arrest our kids and elderly.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.680
You'll have to release them. Now.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.480
Judge's orders.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.600
Let's go, let's go!

45:22.040 --> 45:22.920
Fuck!

45:22.920 --> 45:23.960
Detective Banha!

45:25.040 --> 45:26.960
We have to let them all go.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.520
Told you!

45:28.520 --> 45:31.280
You heard the lady!
Come on, come on, release me!

45:31.280 --> 45:34.000
Ha! We're free to go, motherfuckers!

45:34.760 --> 45:36.240
Let's get out of here, huh?

45:37.720 --> 45:38.760
Ah...

45:40.720 --> 45:41.960
Fucking little bitch.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.840
That fucking little bitch.
I know who fucking fucked us over.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.720
Yes.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.360
Fucking baker! You fucked us over.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.960
I didn't say anything, Mr. Arruda.

46:36.960 --> 46:37.920
Shh.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.280
I didn't say anything.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.840
I swear, Mr. Arruda, I didn't snitch.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.840
I swear I didn't say anything.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.800
Motherfucker!

46:53.640 --> 46:55.320
- Anyway...
- Fucking rat.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.080
Right here.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.440
Come on.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.280
Pull!

47:18.800 --> 47:21.040
It's there. It's there!

47:25.200 --> 47:26.400
No, like this.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.640
We are the real Ribeira Grande,
ladies and gentlemen!

47:29.640 --> 47:33.160
Fuck yeah, motherfuckers!

47:36.000 --> 47:38.760
It's God's will!
Never forget that, okay, Rafael?

47:39.440 --> 47:40.360
God's will.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.160
<i>After winning
the cocaine lottery,</i>

47:55.680 --> 47:57.680
<i>and the miracle of escaping the police,</i>

47:58.200 --> 47:59.120

48:00.160 --> 48:04.000

48:04.000 --> 48:05.520
