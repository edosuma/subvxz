03:28.142 --> 03:31.012
Well, the Goddess
is dead, too.

03:33.014 --> 03:34.381
Dead, dead,
dead, dead, dead.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.449
But, at least, when you
get to the crime scene,

03:36.483 --> 03:38.152
the Goddess' corpse
is on top.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.089
My chest feels weird,

03:42.123 --> 03:45.226
- feels hyper and weird.
- We can't wait.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.661
All right, if you
subtract the remainder...

03:46.694 --> 03:49.997
- Melanie!
- How are you guys eating so much?

03:50.031 --> 03:51.966
We have a healthy
lifestyle here.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.501
That's why we don't live in L.A.
or Buenos Aires

03:54.534 --> 03:56.369
or wherever people
live these days, so...

03:56.403 --> 03:59.106
Also note that there's
only one holding.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.175
Therefore, reconciliation
should be fairly simple.

04:01.209 --> 04:03.376
- Melanie!
- Simple.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.511
Drink a glass of water.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.047
- You'll feel all better.
- Yeah.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.249
Um, Melanie,
could you get Juana water?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.618
Okay, yes to one.
No to two and three.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.087
Red meat is
good for you.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.755
Cervical bruising
is good for you.

04:14.789 --> 04:17.725
Exactly in that order.
Hi, girls.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.426
Send it back to me
by the 15th.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.228
What the fuck?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.799
...certain sectors,
we're definitely gonna...

04:26.033 --> 04:27.434
He is, isn't he?

04:28.636 --> 04:29.770
Handsome.

04:29.804 --> 04:32.340
Wow, such a long drive.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.708
I wish you lived in L.A.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.575
Oh, no, thank you.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.179
We only leave
old Mexico these days

04:38.212 --> 04:40.748
to buy clothes
or, like...

04:40.781 --> 04:42.582
What do you mean,
"leave Mexico"?

04:42.617 --> 04:44.118
You're in <i>Mjico.</i>

04:44.151 --> 04:45.119
Whatever, dude.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.787
No, not <i>Mjico.</i>

04:46.821 --> 04:49.323
This here is Mexico.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.061
Okay, I don't get your jokes.

04:54.095 --> 04:55.495
What's "Mexico"?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.200
Mexico is a huge
crowded nation

04:59.233 --> 05:01.636
a couple hundred miles
that way.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.470
Mexico...

05:04.839 --> 05:07.474
is an independent
crypto-micro-nation...

05:09.509 --> 05:11.612
surrounded
on all sides by the USA.

05:11.646 --> 05:13.714
And you're in it.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.784
But it's true, though.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.552
That's what people in town
have called our family's land

05:19.586 --> 05:21.554
- for a hundred years.
- Really?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.556
The whole town
calls it that.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.591
That's fucked up.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.296
How long have you
been standing there?

05:28.329 --> 05:30.197
Just got here.

05:30.231 --> 05:31.799
Don't you start at 9:00?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.501
Uh, not on days when your
dad has me on night watch.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.736
Uh, this came for you.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.537
Is it
from Hong Kong?

05:37.570 --> 05:39.273
I don't know.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.376
Hey, you want juice?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.145
He isn't
gonna touch it.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.616
Uh, yeah. O-Okay.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.352
Oh, no.

05:51.385 --> 05:55.423
Baby, no, no, not...
not bottled water.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.291
Bring her
a tall glass.

05:57.325 --> 05:58.793
Yeah, it's fine.

05:58.826 --> 05:59.794
Okay?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.796
No, it's okay.
Go on.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.334
Thanks.

06:34.295 --> 06:35.896
"Why do you have
a thermometer behind your ear?

06:39.934 --> 06:41.602
"Fuck.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.939
Fuck. Some asshole
has my pencil."

07:00.721 --> 07:02.323
Is this expensive wine?

07:02.356 --> 07:03.891
You bet.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.529
How long
you worked here?

07:09.562 --> 07:11.198
35 years.

07:11.232 --> 07:13.401
- Jesus.
- Jesus what?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.771
- Nothing.
- How long have you worked here?

07:16.804 --> 07:17.772
A week.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.806
That's right.

07:20.341 --> 07:23.944
This is a much better
job than it looks like.

07:23.978 --> 07:25.780
Don't assume
I haven't had

07:25.813 --> 07:27.915
more glamorous
opportunities.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.216
I didn't.

07:30.251 --> 07:31.886
Ah...

07:31.919 --> 07:34.587
I could have trained
sled dogs.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.291
Iditarod.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.392
Okay.

07:38.426 --> 07:41.495
I had this one dog,
fast as hell.

07:43.664 --> 07:47.201
Just don't
judge my life again

07:47.234 --> 07:48.769
until you've
figured it.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.704
Figured what?

07:50.738 --> 07:52.873
What's far
from fucking normal

07:52.907 --> 07:56.310
about this place,
the family.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.283
What's that mean?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.286
Ah, you'll know it
when you know it,

08:05.319 --> 08:06.687
if you don't quit.

10:00.602 --> 10:01.702
Need help with anything?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.904
No.

10:08.409 --> 10:09.944
How long
you lived here?

10:10.945 --> 10:12.046
Where?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.415
Here. Wherever.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.950
In Winfield.
In the county.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.555
Oh, yeah, I live in town.

10:21.589 --> 10:22.957
For how long?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.425
About a month.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.493
Work for the Mexicans,
right?

10:29.631 --> 10:31.732
What is this?

10:31.765 --> 10:34.168
Just trying to help you
find everything you need.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.079
I work for
the Arista family.

10:45.112 --> 10:48.650
The Aristas.
Good customers.

10:52.654 --> 10:55.055
Okay, boys, back to work.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.890
Yeah, we'll get
back to work.

10:58.459 --> 11:00.427
Have fun
at the Arista place.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.738
Don't drink the water.

11:13.474 --> 11:15.075
Whatever, man.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.638
Why are you both so bad?

11:43.672 --> 11:46.073
Because
we're just bad.

11:48.743 --> 11:50.878
Because we
lack maturity.

11:52.246 --> 11:53.580
You do, anyway.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.983
I admit it.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.818
Can't do anything
about it.

11:59.654 --> 12:01.488
The thing about
being immature

12:01.522 --> 12:05.526
is that you can't suddenly decide
that you want to be mature.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.561
It's already mature
to want to be mature.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.863
Mm, speak for yourself.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.166
Why don't you tell me one
of your theories, <i>brujita?</i>

12:12.199 --> 12:14.835
- Ah, don't call her that.
- Why not?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.805
Only Papa calls her that.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.138
Look, a double bubble.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.140
Just my education
didn't go to waste.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.475
Don't worry
about that.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.146
Give us a theory.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.948
I like a theory
with my tea.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.885
Really? But it's
so nice out.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.520
Tell us a theory.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.159
Well, in the future,

12:39.193 --> 12:41.595
people will pay
to have the Internet

12:41.629 --> 12:43.832
plastered with
slander about them,

12:43.864 --> 12:48.569
false addresses,
duplicate profiles,

12:48.603 --> 12:53.140
fake news, fake nudes,
fake passwords,

12:53.173 --> 12:58.045
sex with their faces
plastered onto actors' bodies.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.315
This will be
the new privacy...

13:02.784 --> 13:04.853
anonymity
within the overload.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.287
Personal data
will be safe again

13:07.321 --> 13:08.857
once it's buried
under an avalanche

13:08.889 --> 13:11.826
of fake
embarrassments.

13:15.797 --> 13:17.598
That's not a bad idea.

13:17.632 --> 13:19.299
We're just not even
close yet, though.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.036
But once there's
multiple fake sex tapes

13:23.070 --> 13:25.072
of every human being
on social media,

13:25.105 --> 13:28.041
then the release of a real
sex tape will be harmless.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.143
That'll be sad.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.944
I like real sex tapes.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.748
What about you, <i>brujita?</i>

13:33.782 --> 13:36.785
What's your nasty habit
this week?

13:36.818 --> 13:38.118
Uh...

13:39.186 --> 13:42.891
being sad,
but looking happy.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.937
In Tokyo, I had
a painless hard mass

13:56.970 --> 13:59.973
with irregular edges...

14:01.041 --> 14:02.744
in my left breast.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.079
- Really?
- Really?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.949
Disappeared entirely
the few days I've been home.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.722
Well, that's good.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.933
Fuck, man,
these are heavy.

16:38.967 --> 16:41.002
- Yep.
- They're complaining.

16:41.035 --> 16:43.136
They can complain in town until
they're tired of complaining.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.372
This is how it is right now.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.874
I don't care...

16:46.908 --> 16:49.209
What's in these? Bricks?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.477
Don't know.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.212
Bullshit, you don't.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.115
Shit.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.118
Wine, maybe?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.386
Fuck, man.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.389
- She just wants to know...
- Okay.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.257
Come back after it rains
if she wants that.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.460
Tell her, for now,
it's the same as it always is.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.801
- I'll count this in the house.
- Okay.

17:15.903 --> 17:17.204
What'd I say?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.238
Uh...

17:40.594 --> 17:42.030
Shit.

17:58.146 --> 17:59.479
Mm.

18:01.983 --> 18:03.918
Oh. Oh, excuse me.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.557
...fireball. That's right.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.459
He's with you. He's with us.

18:12.492 --> 18:16.097
He knows your life ain't
no less important than theirs.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.132
He knows that
the real purpose there

18:18.166 --> 18:21.069
is to make the honest,
working citizens of our country

18:21.102 --> 18:23.037
look like fools.

18:23.071 --> 18:25.372
They did it with the new
oil pipeline in the Dakotas...

18:25.405 --> 18:28.876
Hey, sorry about that,
man. I, uh...

18:29.877 --> 18:31.946
No harm done.

18:31.979 --> 18:33.981
Thanks.

18:35.650 --> 18:37.250
You work in Mexico?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.486
Yeah.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.555
Good pay?

18:42.924 --> 18:44.192
Not bad.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.194
They let you
drink the water?

18:49.596 --> 18:53.266
Man, is that some sort of,
like, local racist joke or...

18:55.368 --> 18:57.237
You calling me a racist?

18:58.906 --> 19:00.007
Man...

19:01.642 --> 19:03.945
It's okay.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.980
Everyone's racist
subconsciously.

19:06.013 --> 19:08.015
Read that
in "The New York Times."

19:51.626 --> 19:53.261
Where's my straw?

19:53.293 --> 19:54.662
What the fuck?

19:58.633 --> 20:00.134
Hey.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.706
No, no, no, no, no.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.407
- I'm mad at you.
- What the fuck?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.043
The guy can walk me.

20:09.076 --> 20:11.444
I don't want you
waking Papa up.

20:11.478 --> 20:15.950
He says you're a symptom
of imperial decline.

20:15.983 --> 20:17.551
"Symptom" what?

20:17.584 --> 20:21.956
Imperial decline!

20:26.627 --> 20:28.562
W-Walk me
to the house.

20:32.633 --> 20:35.402
Hey. Hey.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.604
How strong are you?

20:39.106 --> 20:40.975
I don't know. Strong.

20:41.008 --> 20:45.246
Good. My feet hurt so badly,
I can barely walk.

20:45.279 --> 20:50.084
Oh. Don't let dirt
get on my dress.

20:50.117 --> 20:52.620
Pick me up.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.456
What, like carry you?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.025
The house is
all the way over...

20:59.593 --> 21:01.428
way down there.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.065
Fucking piggyback.
Get down.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.303
Yeah, okay.

21:20.248 --> 21:22.016
You smell good.

21:22.049 --> 21:25.186
James Dean's
asleep in my barn.

21:29.323 --> 21:31.391
He's my pony.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.827
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

22:15.603 --> 22:16.637
Hey!

22:16.671 --> 22:18.205
Shit. Sorry.
I hurt you?

22:18.239 --> 22:22.610
Don't bump your vertebrae
into my pussy.

22:22.643 --> 22:24.245
What the fuck? How can you...

22:24.278 --> 22:25.680
Shh. Damn.

22:25.713 --> 22:27.615
Don't wake your dad up.

22:27.648 --> 22:29.383
Hey, stop.

22:29.417 --> 22:31.451
No, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna put you down.

22:33.154 --> 22:35.256
If you put me down,
I'll tell my papa

22:35.289 --> 22:37.792
that you slammed
yourself into my pussy.

22:37.825 --> 22:39.327
What the fuck, dude?

22:39.360 --> 22:42.263
You're touching it
right now with your back!

22:42.296 --> 22:44.865
Shh. Stop.
What the fuck?

22:44.899 --> 22:46.867
I'm gonna
put you down, okay?

22:46.901 --> 22:50.104
Don't test me,
Don.

22:50.137 --> 22:53.207
Fuck, man.
Fucking coke brain.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.677
Mm. Carry me
to the house.

22:56.711 --> 22:57.845
That's what I'm doing.

22:57.878 --> 23:01.382
Also, right now,

23:01.415 --> 23:04.352
you're touching my pussy
with your spine,

23:04.385 --> 23:07.722
but, like, that's
socially acceptable

23:07.755 --> 23:09.423
until I mention it.

23:09.457 --> 23:12.660
And also people carry shit
around in their intestines,

23:12.693 --> 23:16.130
so you're, like, always,
like, like, like, a foot away

23:16.163 --> 23:18.132
from someone else's
shit. Then it's...

23:18.165 --> 23:21.602
But, like,
That's cool until you mention it.

23:21.635 --> 23:25.206
Mm. Put me down
on the steps.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.573
That's what I'm doing.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.914
This is a good system

23:33.948 --> 23:36.549
for when I come home
from L.A. at 6 A.M.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.219
and my feet hurt so bad.

23:38.252 --> 23:40.821
Ah, good night, Tania.

24:27.001 --> 24:27.968
You like that?

24:28.002 --> 24:30.438
Ow. Yeah, that's good.

24:32.606 --> 24:34.475
Uh, you wanted
to see me?

24:37.778 --> 24:40.648
- Yes. Um...
- Okay.

24:40.681 --> 24:43.684
Yes. This is a matter
of some delicacy.

24:45.753 --> 24:47.822
Okay.

24:47.855 --> 24:50.458
Well, Don, um...

24:52.393 --> 24:56.263
we'd like to ask you about
the well and the pump system.

24:57.264 --> 24:58.365
The well?

24:59.467 --> 25:01.602
Oh, yeah.

25:01.635 --> 25:04.405
What did you think
we wanted to see you about?

25:05.739 --> 25:06.740
I don't know.

25:09.643 --> 25:14.748
Have you been using
well water for yard work?

25:14.782 --> 25:16.484
No.

25:16.517 --> 25:19.320
Mike told me to use the
county water from the spigot

25:19.353 --> 25:22.723
for the lawns and
pools and groves.

25:22.756 --> 25:23.824
That's right.

25:23.858 --> 25:26.293
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

25:26.327 --> 25:30.764
Well, have you seen Mike or
Melanie use the well taps

25:30.798 --> 25:34.735
or the girls'
fountain for...

25:35.903 --> 25:38.439
I don't know.
Filling containers?

25:38.472 --> 25:40.407
The well taps
are the ones you use

25:40.441 --> 25:42.710
in the master bedroom for
drinking and in the kitchen?

25:42.743 --> 25:44.478
That's right.

25:44.512 --> 25:46.780
Then maybe talk to Melanie
if it's a kitchen problem.

25:46.814 --> 25:48.716
You do know, though,

25:48.749 --> 25:51.485
that we keep our water
separate here.

25:51.519 --> 25:53.387
We only drink well water,

25:53.420 --> 25:55.289
and we use county water
for everything else?

25:55.322 --> 26:00.561
Yeah. Yeah, uh, Mike explained it when...
when he hired me.

26:02.429 --> 26:04.633
Fine. Well, the, uh...

26:04.665 --> 26:07.568
- The well...
- the well is low.

26:10.571 --> 26:12.573
Do you want me
to go down inside it?

26:12.607 --> 26:13.807
I'm not claustrophobic.

26:13.841 --> 26:16.577
I've done, uh,
crawlspace work before.

26:16.611 --> 26:18.679
I did plumbing
back in Florida.

26:18.712 --> 26:20.414
Oh, no.
That's fine.

26:20.447 --> 26:21.849
W-We're sorry
that we bothered you.

26:21.882 --> 26:23.551
Yeah. Um...

26:23.584 --> 26:24.985
- Okay.
- But listen.

26:25.019 --> 26:27.555
Uh, for the next
couple of weeks,

26:27.588 --> 26:32.726
instead of just walking around
all the acres at night...

26:32.760 --> 26:33.827
Mm-hmm.

26:33.861 --> 26:36.530
why not just camp out
by the well.

26:36.564 --> 26:38.766
- But out of sight.
- Yes.

26:40.067 --> 26:44.572
Y-You want me
to hide in the bushes?

26:44.606 --> 26:48.643
Uh, there's the big tree
with the vultures' nest.

26:48.677 --> 26:52.346
Sure, but take a lawn
chair so you're comfortable

26:52.379 --> 26:53.447
and a dark blanket.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.416
Yes, absolutely.

26:55.449 --> 26:57.451
We want you
to be comfortable.

26:57.484 --> 26:58.485
Mm-hmm.

26:59.486 --> 27:00.888
But not obvious.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.996
I'm gonna get back on
untangling Tania's necklaces.

27:09.029 --> 27:10.731
Okay.
Thank you, Don.

27:11.966 --> 27:13.801
We really
appreciate it.

27:17.838 --> 27:18.906
He doesn't
know a thing.

27:18.939 --> 27:19.907
No, I agree.

27:54.441 --> 27:57.811
...and then
you're there for some reason,

27:57.845 --> 28:01.415
but you're eating
virtual vomit off the floor.

28:01.448 --> 28:03.718
And you don't want
to eat too much vomit,

28:03.752 --> 28:05.019
'cause you're on a diet,

28:05.052 --> 28:06.987
but it just tastes
so real, so...

28:07.021 --> 28:10.424
And, luckily for me,
you've already eaten it 9,999 times,

28:10.457 --> 28:11.992
so there's
barely any vomit left.

28:12.026 --> 28:13.827
No, that's not
how simulations work.

28:13.861 --> 28:16.631
The vomit would
obviously reset.

28:16.665 --> 28:18.799
Your simulations always lack
a basic logical consistency.

28:18.832 --> 28:20.200
Oh, mine do?
Yours are idiotic.

28:20.234 --> 28:22.136
If you think about it,

28:22.169 --> 28:24.571
it's the people with
the preexisting conditions

28:24.606 --> 28:26.106
that are the people
that cost the most.

28:28.643 --> 28:31.178
Are you listening to me?

28:31.211 --> 28:32.212
Yeah.

28:34.114 --> 28:36.150
Don't you care
about politics?

28:36.183 --> 28:37.719
I don't know.

28:37.752 --> 28:39.721
Did you vote?

28:39.754 --> 28:41.455
Yeah.

28:41.488 --> 28:43.792
You've known those girls
since they were little kids?

28:44.793 --> 28:46.560
Sorry to say.

28:46.593 --> 28:47.729
You don't like them?

28:49.096 --> 28:51.031
I've known them
since they were in diapers.

28:51.065 --> 28:52.833
They don't even
know my name.

28:53.834 --> 28:55.169
They know your name.

28:55.202 --> 28:58.939
They're godless, arrogant,
sick-minded brats

28:58.972 --> 29:01.676
who waste a lot
of electricity and water,

29:01.710 --> 29:04.878
but I like my job.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.648
They're nice to me.

29:06.681 --> 29:08.182
For a minute.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.626
Cleaning a barbecue.

29:22.096 --> 29:24.898
You're a boring kid, Don.

29:24.932 --> 29:26.867
Educate yourself.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.303
Fuck you, man.

29:31.171 --> 29:33.107
Where are you from, anyway?

29:33.140 --> 29:34.908
Florida.

29:34.942 --> 29:39.714
Then what's with
this Oklahoma horseshit?

29:39.748 --> 29:41.148
What?

29:41.181 --> 29:43.884
Why do you dress like that?

29:46.954 --> 29:48.757
What's wrong with this?

29:56.831 --> 29:58.966
Go read a book.

30:00.267 --> 30:01.902
You go
read a book.

30:01.935 --> 30:03.772
I dress
the same as you.

30:03.805 --> 30:05.807
Fine distinctions.

30:06.841 --> 30:09.744
Get a library card.

30:09.778 --> 30:12.179
Man, why don't you
go get a library... Agh.

30:12.212 --> 30:13.681
Ow!

30:13.715 --> 30:15.249
- Fuck.
- Get a what?

30:17.351 --> 30:20.020
Go get a couple beers tonight?

30:20.053 --> 30:22.589
- Are you buying?
- Yeah.

30:22.624 --> 30:24.358
Just don't ever kick me
in the ass again.

30:25.894 --> 30:27.762
I'm not neurotic, per se.

30:27.796 --> 30:29.596
I'd say that
you're more neurotic.

30:33.668 --> 30:35.969
Neurosis is no longer
in the DSM, though.

30:36.003 --> 30:38.740
It's an extinct condition.

30:41.910 --> 30:46.648
But we're definitely
cut off from something.

30:47.649 --> 30:48.616
We are.

30:48.650 --> 30:51.251
Look at
the groundskeepers.

30:51.285 --> 30:56.223
Those guys enjoy
a solid, authentic,

30:56.256 --> 30:58.592
working-class environment

30:58.626 --> 31:00.327
that we could
never understand.

31:01.395 --> 31:03.263
Who were you
impersonating?

31:03.297 --> 31:04.632
I don't know.

31:05.633 --> 31:06.801
The media.

31:06.835 --> 31:10.204
Mm, Tanita has a theory
about the media.

31:10.237 --> 31:11.873
I don't have a theory.

31:11.906 --> 31:13.741
You have
all the theories.

31:14.943 --> 31:16.343
- Switchy?
- No. I'm not in the mood.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.781
Oh, come on.
Come on. Switchy.

31:19.814 --> 31:21.348
Expand my theory,
genius.

31:21.381 --> 31:22.750
Okay, fine.

31:25.052 --> 31:26.253
Go.

31:29.056 --> 31:31.058
Middle-class people

31:31.091 --> 31:35.295
think working-class
people are...

31:35.329 --> 31:37.632
"salt of the earth,"

31:37.665 --> 31:39.901
more real,

31:39.934 --> 31:42.336
more authentic,

31:42.369 --> 31:45.740
but this is really

31:45.773 --> 31:48.141
condesation... cond...

31:48.175 --> 31:51.411
condescension
masquerading as...

31:51.445 --> 31:53.213
esteem.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.082
Not to mention,

31:55.115 --> 31:59.721
the world presented to us

31:59.754 --> 32:03.825
by our perceptions

32:03.858 --> 32:06.360
is not...

32:06.393 --> 32:09.029
reality, per se.

32:09.062 --> 32:13.033
To get
anywhere close to...

32:13.066 --> 32:16.370
"authentic reality"

32:16.403 --> 32:22.242
means pushing
at the boundaries of...

32:23.277 --> 32:25.713
neuroscience

32:25.747 --> 32:28.917
and fundamental physics.

32:31.118 --> 32:35.723
Careers in these fields
typically require

32:35.757 --> 32:38.325
a privileged childhood

32:38.358 --> 32:44.331
and hundreds of thousands
of tuition dollars.

32:44.364 --> 32:45.867
Conclusion...

32:46.968 --> 32:51.005
the world is authentically

32:51.039 --> 32:55.108
unfair and fucked up.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.823
Nice half-ton. New?

33:08.856 --> 33:10.825
Ah, I had it
since December.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.828
Then why do you drive that
piece of shit to work every day?

33:14.862 --> 33:16.064
So Henry and Monica

33:16.096 --> 33:17.899
don't think
I don't need a raise.

33:17.932 --> 33:20.267
Are they not home?

33:20.300 --> 33:23.370
They went
to Turks and Caicos,

33:23.403 --> 33:25.172
left early
this morning.

33:25.205 --> 33:26.206
Turk's and who?

33:28.009 --> 33:30.277
Some islands
in the Caribbean.

33:32.479 --> 33:34.181
Hey, did the girls
go with 'em?

33:35.215 --> 33:36.784
No.

33:36.818 --> 33:38.786
Then, you don't care
if the girls see your truck?

33:38.820 --> 33:41.421
No. I told you
I'm invisible to them.

33:43.925 --> 33:45.258
Hey, could I get a...

35:04.605 --> 35:06.273
You know,
your door's just open.

35:06.306 --> 35:08.943
Is it cold out there?

35:08.976 --> 35:14.182
Um, you know,
I'm only 28.

35:14.214 --> 35:15.449
I'm only 36.

35:15.482 --> 35:17.018
What? No, you're not.

35:17.051 --> 35:18.986
You wanna see
my passport?

35:20.154 --> 35:22.023
I just mean
that, you know,

35:22.056 --> 35:23.457
I'm not that much older
than you,

35:23.490 --> 35:25.993
and I like to party.

35:26.027 --> 35:27.594
Oh, yeah?

35:27.628 --> 35:28.996
You "like to party?"

35:29.030 --> 35:30.530
Ah, fuck you. Come on.

35:30.564 --> 35:32.499
Aren't you
on the clock?

35:32.532 --> 35:34.267
Are you
gonna tell your dad?

35:35.402 --> 35:37.304
You can come in

35:37.337 --> 35:40.373
if you do
four lines in a row.

35:40.407 --> 35:42.110
Four? How 'bout one?

35:42.143 --> 35:44.478
Four!

35:44.511 --> 35:46.981
Hey, I'll do four if you
stop making that noise.

36:04.165 --> 36:06.366
Ah, I already
told you that one.

36:06.399 --> 36:09.203
You have to do two more.

36:09.237 --> 36:10.638
No, I did... I did the...

36:10.671 --> 36:12.907
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

36:12.940 --> 36:14.474
no, no, no.
Do it. Do it.

36:14.508 --> 36:16.510
Social contract, motherfucker.

36:16.543 --> 36:18.578
You agreed to four lines.

36:19.947 --> 36:21.581
1, 2, 3, 4.
Go, go, go, go.

36:33.728 --> 36:35.062
What?

36:35.096 --> 36:37.165
A Jew taught me
that one.

36:37.198 --> 36:39.133
Shouldn't you
be guarding the well?

36:39.167 --> 36:40.635
Man, I'm out there
all night every night.

36:40.668 --> 36:44.005
Just I don't see nothing
but fucking raccoons.

36:44.038 --> 36:45.505
Come on.

36:45.539 --> 36:47.975
Snort, pig, snort.
Snort, pig, snort.

39:58.632 --> 40:01.836
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

40:01.869 --> 40:02.870
Mother.

40:03.904 --> 40:05.439
Henry, what are
we doing here?

40:05.473 --> 40:06.941
Everyone...

40:08.242 --> 40:10.378
Henry,
I worked here since...

40:10.411 --> 40:12.279
I know. I know
this is demeaning.

40:12.313 --> 40:15.483
Uh, I just need to talk
to everyone at once.

40:16.617 --> 40:17.885
Hey.

40:17.918 --> 40:19.253
It's not a police lineup.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.455
I just need
everyone's attention.

40:21.489 --> 40:22.656
Okay.

40:24.625 --> 40:27.261
The well's at 30%.

40:27.294 --> 40:30.431
Last week, when we left,
it was at 67%.

40:30.464 --> 40:31.832
- 30%?
- That's right.

40:31.866 --> 40:33.367
And when
will it replenish?

40:33.401 --> 40:34.602
When it rains.

40:34.635 --> 40:36.604
But does the rainwater
immediately...

40:36.637 --> 40:37.872
- Shh!
- So you think someone

40:37.905 --> 40:39.740
went in there and
pumped all that water out

40:39.774 --> 40:40.941
without any of us
seeing that?

40:40.975 --> 40:43.377
No small operation
to drain a well.

40:43.411 --> 40:47.547
We just want to know if
anyone has seen anything.

40:49.483 --> 40:50.651
- No.
- No, Mama.

40:53.621 --> 40:54.622
No.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.495
I want you
to install CCTV.

41:01.529 --> 41:02.696
Okay.

41:02.730 --> 41:05.299
No, this is
a serious situation.

41:05.332 --> 41:06.400
Don.

41:06.434 --> 41:09.203
- Don.
- Yeah?

41:09.236 --> 41:10.638
You've been
watching the well?

41:10.671 --> 41:12.440
Yeah.

41:13.441 --> 41:14.475
All night?

41:15.743 --> 41:17.645
Yeah.

41:17.678 --> 41:18.879
Each night?

41:21.682 --> 41:22.750
Yeah.

41:25.453 --> 41:26.887
You don't sleep?

41:26.921 --> 41:29.490
Oh, I...

41:29.523 --> 41:31.425
I sleep at home,

41:31.459 --> 41:33.828
8 A.M. to 4 P.M.

42:01.455 --> 42:03.991
Ah,
changing of the guard.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.459
I liked
your other truck.

42:06.594 --> 42:09.363
Boss is back.
So's the beater.

42:09.396 --> 42:10.531
Mike.

42:10.564 --> 42:12.466
What?
I'm late for dinner.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.335
What's the deal
with the water?

42:15.503 --> 42:17.972
Henry and Monica
are freaks about it.

42:18.005 --> 42:19.740
People in town
are freaks about it.

42:19.773 --> 42:20.941
Ah...

42:20.975 --> 42:22.977
Now the girls are
acting weird about it.

42:23.978 --> 42:25.346
Come on.

42:25.379 --> 42:27.781
What? Tell me what
the fuck is going on.

42:27.815 --> 42:31.318
I-I'm gonna fuck
something up and get fired

42:31.352 --> 42:33.087
if I don't know
what's going on.

42:34.455 --> 42:36.891
Eh, the Aristas
think their well water

42:36.924 --> 42:39.293
is healthier
than other water.

42:39.326 --> 42:41.595
Certain other people
think so, too.

42:43.697 --> 42:45.432
What, like spring water?

42:45.466 --> 42:47.636
Like mineral water?

42:47.668 --> 42:48.669
Sure.

42:51.071 --> 42:52.740
That's it?

42:55.644 --> 42:56.877
They sell it.

42:57.945 --> 43:01.582
I-It has a flavor,
too, unusual,

43:01.616 --> 43:02.651
like...

43:04.418 --> 43:06.353
Ah, I can't describe it.

43:06.387 --> 43:09.123
I only tasted it
the one time 10 years ago.

43:10.891 --> 43:13.861
Oh, so that's what's with
the cases and the vans.

43:13.894 --> 43:16.063
You catch on slow.

43:17.498 --> 43:18.799
I mean, like,
why all the security

43:18.832 --> 43:20.568
if it's
just mineral water?

43:20.602 --> 43:24.338
Do they have their own brand
of mineral water in the stores?

43:24.371 --> 43:26.807
No. Go guard the well.

43:28.075 --> 43:29.043
This job sucks.

43:29.076 --> 43:30.477
You asked for it.

43:30.511 --> 43:33.414
Wasn't night watch
when I signed up.

43:33.447 --> 43:35.783
Evolve or die.

43:36.951 --> 43:39.053
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

43:39.086 --> 43:40.689
What?

43:40.721 --> 43:43.123
Mm, you believe
in evolution?

43:43.157 --> 43:44.491
Hell, no.

44:05.045 --> 44:07.414
It ain't the ghost

44:07.448 --> 44:11.385
If it don't speak in tongues.

44:11.418 --> 44:13.554
It's not a victory

44:13.587 --> 44:16.725
'Til the battle's been won

44:27.736 --> 44:31.872
Something like
mass destruction, fucking...

44:34.141 --> 44:36.477
Ah ah

44:50.858 --> 44:52.226
Hey.

44:53.494 --> 44:54.495
Yes?

44:55.764 --> 44:57.131
You guys not
partying tonight?

44:57.164 --> 44:58.599
It's Friday.

44:58.633 --> 45:01.035
No. No party here.

45:02.503 --> 45:03.772
Just, you know...

45:04.938 --> 45:08.208
you know, last week,
you guys and I...

45:08.242 --> 45:10.077
and it was cool,
you know?

45:10.110 --> 45:11.478
- Just...
- Hmm.

45:14.616 --> 45:15.784
Is Tania here?

45:15.816 --> 45:18.986
Yes. It's...

45:19.019 --> 45:21.790
I'm sorry.
A-Are we not...

45:21.822 --> 45:23.692
we not friends
anymore?

45:23.725 --> 45:26.493
'Cause, you know,
like, um...

45:26.527 --> 45:28.228
what happened
to last week?

45:28.262 --> 45:30.597
Very strange question.

45:30.632 --> 45:33.601
Right.
Uh, it's just...

45:33.635 --> 45:35.502
Okay, do you want
to see her?

45:35.536 --> 45:36.503
Yeah, all right.

45:36.537 --> 45:38.539
- Hey.
- Hi, Don.

45:38.572 --> 45:39.873
Hey.

45:39.907 --> 45:41.676
Hi, Tania.

45:41.710 --> 45:43.177
What's the problem?

45:43.210 --> 45:46.046
Ah, your sister's
just being weird.

45:48.783 --> 45:50.819
I-I mean, you know,
just she needs help

45:50.851 --> 45:54.054
remembering that we
partied last week.

45:55.222 --> 45:58.125
Hey, you should
go watch the well.

45:58.158 --> 45:59.593
Y-Yeah. I mean...

45:59.627 --> 46:00.861
that's what
I was doing. Was...

46:00.894 --> 46:03.063
She's right.

46:05.899 --> 46:08.035
Yeah.

46:09.838 --> 46:11.939
Hey, why you guys treating
me like I'm the...

46:13.006 --> 46:14.875
fucking hired help?

46:14.908 --> 46:16.076
Did I do something?

46:18.946 --> 46:21.649
I mean, you licked my mouth.

46:23.117 --> 46:25.219
I lick
all kinds of things.

46:25.252 --> 46:26.954
She's like a dog.

46:26.987 --> 46:30.023
James, meet Don.

46:30.057 --> 46:31.892
Don, meet James.

46:35.162 --> 46:37.832
Okay, you should
go do your job.

46:37.866 --> 46:40.167
We're all really upset
about the water level.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.636
Good night.

46:41.669 --> 46:43.203
Yeah, good night.
Yeah.

46:59.286 --> 47:00.722
Look at that.

47:00.755 --> 47:02.122
Push it.

47:06.694 --> 47:08.362
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

47:09.363 --> 47:10.665
Oh, shit.

47:38.158 --> 47:39.661
Who the fuck's that?

47:39.694 --> 47:40.695
Is that a gun?

47:40.728 --> 47:42.764
I think so.

47:42.797 --> 47:44.064
Oh, shit. That is a gun.

47:44.097 --> 47:45.265
- Go! Go!
- Wait.

47:46.300 --> 47:47.836
Hey!

47:47.869 --> 47:49.838
Hey! What the fuck?

47:50.939 --> 47:53.273
Fuck sake. Hey! Hey!

47:53.307 --> 47:55.042
No!

48:10.357 --> 48:11.325
What the fuck?

48:13.393 --> 48:15.395
Shit.

48:17.297 --> 48:18.332
Hey!

48:22.670 --> 48:24.137
Pussies!

48:24.171 --> 48:25.974
Ow motherfuck!

48:26.006 --> 48:27.307
Holy shit.

48:28.408 --> 48:30.210
You okay?

48:32.179 --> 48:34.883
I'm 71 years old.
That's all.

48:34.916 --> 48:36.283
71?

48:36.316 --> 48:37.417
Yes.

48:47.962 --> 48:50.932
You know,
Don here can identify one of them.

48:50.965 --> 48:54.002
You can fingerprint those
tanks to get the other two.

48:55.202 --> 48:56.905
We don't do that
for misdemeanors.

48:56.938 --> 48:58.806
Except this isn't
a misdemeanor.

48:58.840 --> 49:02.877
The well's at 29%,
despite the rains,

49:02.911 --> 49:05.112
so this is
grand larceny

49:05.145 --> 49:07.180
on top
of trespassing.

49:07.214 --> 49:10.050
Well, trespassing
is a misdemeanor,

49:10.083 --> 49:13.253
unless you live in Colorado
or, I think, New Hampshire,

49:13.287 --> 49:15.222
if it's multiple
trespasses.

49:15.255 --> 49:17.025
This is multiple.
It takes months

49:17.057 --> 49:18.325
to drain a well
three backpacks...

49:18.358 --> 49:20.294
Like I said,
that's just New Hampshire.

49:20.327 --> 49:23.330
So what are you gonna do?

49:23.363 --> 49:25.399
What's going on here?

49:25.432 --> 49:27.401
Well, you come down to the
station in the morning,

49:27.434 --> 49:29.269
file a report,
and we'll do all we can.

49:29.303 --> 49:31.973
And you're gonna check the
hospitals for buckshot wounds?

49:33.140 --> 49:34.408
You know,
shooting a trespasser

49:34.441 --> 49:36.778
is a felony
in all 50 states.

49:37.845 --> 49:39.279
Texas?

49:39.313 --> 49:41.181
Right, Texas.

49:41.214 --> 49:42.249
Not sure
about Texas.

49:42.282 --> 49:44.986
Bad Papa.
Did you shoot someone?

49:45.019 --> 49:46.955
Let's restart this.

49:46.988 --> 49:49.423
You and your colleagues
down at the station

49:49.456 --> 49:52.259
know exactly
what's going on here,

49:52.292 --> 49:55.228
so let's stop pretending
this is a misdemeanor.

49:55.262 --> 49:58.032
I'm not
pretending anything.

49:58.066 --> 50:00.068
Trespassing
is a misdemeanor.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.169
Stealing water,
this amount,

50:02.202 --> 50:04.906
first offense,
$25 to $250 fine...

50:04.939 --> 50:06.373
Please stop playing games.

50:07.374 --> 50:09.744
I'll lose my temper.

50:09.777 --> 50:11.178
You lose
your temper,

50:11.211 --> 50:12.479
and I'll arrest you
right now

50:12.512 --> 50:13.982
for assault
with a shotgun.

50:17.085 --> 50:19.821
So get some rest,
and, uh,

50:19.854 --> 50:21.188
come on down
in the morning.

50:21.221 --> 50:22.857
How dare
you treat my father

50:22.890 --> 50:25.292
- with such disrespect.
- Miss...

50:25.325 --> 50:27.061
You Bolsheviks think
everyone in town

50:27.095 --> 50:29.363
should share our water
until it's gone, don't you?

50:29.396 --> 50:31.866
Doesn't really matter
what I think.

50:34.068 --> 50:36.904
But sharing's
always nice.

50:36.938 --> 50:39.172
They taught me that
in nursery school.

50:39.206 --> 50:43.243
Good luck asking
them to police themselves.

50:43.276 --> 50:44.912
Why should they?

50:44.946 --> 50:46.446
Nothing in it for them.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.516
Honey, they have
all kinds of problems,

50:49.549 --> 50:52.386
meth labs, illiteracy.

50:53.955 --> 50:56.356
It's evident
what needs to be done.

51:24.217 --> 51:25.620
How old is that
fucking thing...

51:42.003 --> 51:42.970
There we go.

51:43.004 --> 51:44.972
There goes
our view.

51:46.206 --> 51:48.241
Of course, this is
the logical eventuality

51:48.275 --> 51:49.977
of the current pattern.

51:50.011 --> 51:52.446
Wealthier nations
will get wealthier,

51:52.479 --> 51:55.582
live longer,
build walls.

51:56.583 --> 51:57.952
Yes, well, it's ugly,

51:57.985 --> 51:59.854
but what
are you gonna do?

51:59.887 --> 52:02.422
Let 'em all come in
and drain us dry?

52:11.298 --> 52:13.101
Didn't get paid enough?

52:13.134 --> 52:15.235
Don't just bang away
like a monkey.

52:27.615 --> 52:30.450
If you have to wear
a shirt under the thing,

52:30.484 --> 52:32.552
c-can you unbutton it?

52:32.586 --> 52:34.122
No, thanks.

52:42.096 --> 52:44.031
Open!

52:44.065 --> 52:46.399
I want nipples
in the photos!

52:47.602 --> 52:49.637
At least give me
a slash of flesh

52:49.670 --> 52:50.972
down the middle
for contrast.

52:54.976 --> 52:57.277
Can you take
the mask off, <i>brujita?</i>

52:57.310 --> 52:59.213
Absolutely not.

53:01.249 --> 53:03.350
Oh, come on. Why not?

53:03.383 --> 53:04.986
Same reason as before.

53:05.019 --> 53:07.287
What reason is that?

53:07.320 --> 53:09.957
I don't want my face
in photos on the Internet

53:09.991 --> 53:12.425
until you are a world-class
fashion photographer.

53:12.459 --> 53:15.395
How could I become one if you
don't let me build my portfolio?

53:15.428 --> 53:17.330
Take pictures. Here.

53:21.002 --> 53:22.369
You're too curvy, anyway.

53:22.402 --> 53:25.438
Just shoot me
like you'd shoot a man.

53:25.472 --> 53:27.407
How does that
make any sense?

53:27.440 --> 53:30.310
All solutions
are counterintuitive

53:30.343 --> 53:32.180
this late in the story.

53:32.213 --> 53:33.948
But I'm not
going for that.

53:33.981 --> 53:37.417
I'm going for a kind of
Lilith in Eden type of thing,

53:37.450 --> 53:39.954
and your mask
is fucking it up!

53:39.987 --> 53:43.291
The cyborg does not
recognize the Garden of Eden.

53:43.356 --> 53:47.161
That mask
makes you a cyborg?

53:47.195 --> 53:49.297
Actually the ubiquity
and invisibility

53:49.329 --> 53:51.999
of machines in everyday
life make me a cyborg.

53:53.067 --> 53:54.568
That's great, <i>brujita.</i>

53:54.602 --> 53:57.337
Malfunction.
Malfunction.

53:57.370 --> 53:59.006
Malfunction.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.242
Malfunction.
Malfunction.

54:01.275 --> 54:02.276
Malfunction.

54:03.343 --> 54:04.679
Malfunction.
Malfun...

54:20.094 --> 54:22.029
Aren't you
on night watch?

54:23.030 --> 54:24.332
Worked on the wall all day.

54:24.364 --> 54:26.234
I can't work all day
and all night.

54:26.267 --> 54:28.035
When you gonna
automate this gate?

54:28.069 --> 54:30.238
Mike's gonna do it soon.

54:32.539 --> 54:34.507
What?

54:36.644 --> 54:39.379
Do you want to party
with us tonight?

54:42.382 --> 54:44.218
I thought I was
just the hired help.

54:44.252 --> 54:45.720
Thought you don't talk
to me anymore.

54:46.754 --> 54:49.223
The help needs
recreation, too.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.161
Where's your car?

54:54.195 --> 54:55.630
Did you walk
all the way here?

54:55.663 --> 54:58.065
Some assholes left
me on the road up there.

54:58.099 --> 55:00.467
Who? The cokehead guy?

55:00.500 --> 55:01.669
No, he's in Rio.

55:02.703 --> 55:04.605
That's in Brazil.

55:04.639 --> 55:06.807
Just local losers.

55:06.841 --> 55:10.510
But didn't I see you
take your car out earlier?

55:10.543 --> 55:12.813
Some <i>gringitospushed it</i>
into a red zone,

55:12.847 --> 55:14.447
and then it got towed
while I was in town,

55:14.481 --> 55:16.350
and then
some other <i>gringos,</i>

55:16.384 --> 55:18.551
they offered me a ride,
but then they left me on the county road.

55:20.254 --> 55:21.454
What the fuck?

55:21.488 --> 55:23.324
Yep.

55:25.293 --> 55:27.862
So do you wanna come
to the playhouse or not?

55:30.563 --> 55:32.465
Um...

55:33.566 --> 55:34.735
sure.

55:36.337 --> 55:41.508
Just... Just let me hide
my truck outside the ranch.

55:42.542 --> 55:44.378
Change my shirt.

56:17.311 --> 56:20.414
So, uh, what are
we celebrating?

56:21.415 --> 56:22.750
We aren't.

56:22.783 --> 56:26.687
You shouldn't think
about champagne that way.

56:26.721 --> 56:28.488
It's not fair
to champagne.

56:30.825 --> 56:32.893
You know,
I-I like how you guys

56:32.927 --> 56:35.296
made this place,
like, crazy.

56:35.329 --> 56:37.698
Yeah, it was our playhouse
when we were little babies.

56:37.732 --> 56:40.601
Then we had Mike
convert it

56:40.634 --> 56:43.170
to a habitat when we
developed breasts.

56:45.339 --> 56:46.307
Ugh.

56:48.209 --> 56:49.610
What is that?

56:50.778 --> 56:52.579
Cocana negra.

56:55.750 --> 56:56.951
Are you addicted?

57:15.870 --> 57:17.338
Hello, Don.

57:18.639 --> 57:20.741
You kinda say my name
weird when you say it.

57:20.775 --> 57:22.910
- "Weirdly."
- What?

57:25.312 --> 57:26.947
So we're doing drugs
with Don.

57:26.981 --> 57:28.716
Is that... Is that
tonight's event?

57:28.749 --> 57:30.384
We have too much.

57:30.418 --> 57:33.521
Our culture is turning
inwards and devouring itself.

57:34.622 --> 57:36.791
We need fresh blood!

58:24.505 --> 58:25.739
Actually, you were wrong.

58:25.773 --> 58:28.275
I found them exactly
where I said they were.

58:28.309 --> 58:31.045
Now let me see.

58:37.051 --> 58:38.986
The... The problem is

58:39.019 --> 58:41.622
the World Economic Forum
ranks us 48th

58:41.655 --> 58:43.357
in math and
science education.

58:49.029 --> 58:51.799
It doesn't matter
if you're intelligent

58:51.832 --> 58:53.467
if you're not likeable.

58:53.501 --> 58:54.869
Give me the other ones.

58:55.870 --> 58:56.837
Do it on her.

58:56.871 --> 58:57.838
Do it, Don.

58:57.872 --> 58:59.306
Yeah.
Open your mouth.

58:59.340 --> 59:00.741
Open.

59:00.774 --> 59:02.576
- Ucch.
- Yeah.

59:09.917 --> 59:12.386
We know no one person
can succeed

59:12.419 --> 59:16.423
unless everyone else
succeeds. Right? Right?

59:17.958 --> 59:19.560
Say something, Don.

59:19.593 --> 59:21.729
Say something
hilarious.

59:21.762 --> 59:23.964
Say something
not hilarious.

59:23.998 --> 59:25.733
That would be hilarious.

59:25.766 --> 59:27.768
It's more humorous
to be not humorous.

59:27.801 --> 59:30.304
What... What do I do?

59:30.337 --> 59:31.972
Say something
hilarious.

59:32.006 --> 59:33.674
What should I say?

59:33.707 --> 59:35.809
- Say something not funny.
- Say something.

59:35.843 --> 59:37.578
- Just... Just don't look at me.
- What do you want me to say?

59:37.612 --> 59:38.679
- Say something hilarious.
- Come on, Don.

59:38.712 --> 59:39.914
Come on, Don.
Come on, Don.

59:39.947 --> 59:41.448
- Do something. Do something.
- Do something.

59:41.482 --> 59:43.317
- What should I do?
- Just do something funny.

59:43.350 --> 59:45.319
- What should I do?
- Do shit, fucker.

59:45.352 --> 59:46.787
- Come on, Don.
- Speak, Koko. Speak.

59:46.820 --> 59:48.689
- What do you...
- Speak!

59:48.722 --> 59:50.558
- Koko, speak!
- Come on, Don.

59:50.591 --> 59:52.359
- Speak, Koko! Speak!
- Rowwr!

01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.802
Do something!

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.084
There is a God-shaped hole
in the heart of every man.

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:18.852
Amen.

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:35.903
I admire your family
so much, you know?

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:37.571
It's like your mom
and your dad,

01:00:37.606 --> 01:00:39.440
they're both
just kinda perfect.

01:00:39.473 --> 01:00:43.477
A-And they have just great
style, like clothes.

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:46.747
And... And you all have
great vocabularies.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.482
You want to dress like Papa?

01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:49.483
No.

01:00:49.516 --> 01:00:50.884
I'm just...

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:52.753
Let's go get some of
Papa's clothes for Don.

01:00:52.786 --> 01:00:54.088
No. No, I just
mean that... I just...

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:56.790
I like how you...
how you live.

01:00:56.824 --> 01:01:00.695
Here is just...
it's like a dream.

01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:01.996
The American dream.

01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:03.998
The myth of paradise
on the other side.

01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:06.601
Ooh.

01:01:06.635 --> 01:01:08.569
Caligula wasn't
the only good emperor.

01:01:08.603 --> 01:01:09.903
"American dream."

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:12.741
Mm. How about another
spoonful, Donny Donny?

01:01:12.773 --> 01:01:14.709
No, no. I'm not
immune to it like you.

01:01:14.743 --> 01:01:16.810
Oh, don't be so tedious.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:18.178
- What the fu...
- Do a spoonful!

01:01:18.212 --> 01:01:20.749
What's in it that
makes it fucking black?

01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:22.816
Irony.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.184
What, like rust?

01:01:24.218 --> 01:01:26.621
Oh, poor baby doesn't
wanna do another spoon.

01:01:26.655 --> 01:01:28.657
Nah. You two
are freaks.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.693
Oh, he wants his mommy.
He's scared.

01:01:31.726 --> 01:01:33.762
My mom died
when I was 17.

01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:36.430
Ohh. He misses his mommy.

01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:38.132
He wants his milkies.

01:01:38.165 --> 01:01:39.133
What the fuck?

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.702
Mm. Here we go.

01:01:40.735 --> 01:01:42.870
Oh, his mommy died.

01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:44.972
Poor baby.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:46.907
He wants his milkies.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.109
Don't do that!
You don't...

01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:51.613
make fun of
my mother's death.

01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:06.927
Come drink, poor baby.

01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:10.964
Fuck.

01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:14.935
Shit, you two
are freaks.

01:02:14.968 --> 01:02:17.237
You just said that.

01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:19.139
But saying
the same thing twice

01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:22.576
is not inherently
a waste of breath.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.211
Come drink, poor baby.

01:02:26.513 --> 01:02:28.148
Why do you
want me to...

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:30.618
Same speech act
performed a second time

01:02:30.652 --> 01:02:33.688
can radically reorient
the context of both acts.

01:02:33.722 --> 01:02:35.657
Good baby.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:37.091
Good baby.

01:02:41.629 --> 01:02:44.064
I'm tired. I'm drunk.

01:02:44.098 --> 01:02:47.901
I was conceived
in a test tube.

01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:50.571
Mmm. Good baby.

01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:51.840
Good baby.

01:02:53.173 --> 01:02:54.875
Good baby.

01:02:56.543 --> 01:02:58.545
That's a good baby.

01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:00.682
Good baby.

01:03:03.951 --> 01:03:06.286
You can fuck me if...

01:03:07.287 --> 01:03:09.089
brujitawatches.

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:11.558
Who's <i>brujita?</i>

01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:12.993
My other baby.

01:03:15.663 --> 01:03:16.897
You serious?

01:03:18.298 --> 01:03:20.300
Are you really
going to neglect

01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:23.671
your opportunities in life
when you have so few?

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:26.573
You're serious.

01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:29.910
Don't. Don't touch.

01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:34.883
What is sexual
objectification?

01:03:34.915 --> 01:03:38.118
How does it function today
in our particular moment

01:03:38.152 --> 01:03:41.054
when labor gives way
to robotics,

01:03:41.088 --> 01:03:43.991
sex itself gives way
to genetic engineering,

01:03:44.024 --> 01:03:47.928
bourgeois realism gives way
to science fiction?

01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:52.566
Et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera,

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:54.869
et cetera, et cetera.

01:03:59.808 --> 01:04:01.776
Wh-What are
you doing?

01:04:12.687 --> 01:04:14.021
Go.

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:29.938
You, too?

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.306
No,
I'm merely helping.

01:04:33.307 --> 01:04:34.843
Okay.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:37.978
Looks like you're
more than helping.

01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:39.246
Well, she's
my little sister.

01:04:39.279 --> 01:04:40.615
She needs help
with everything.

01:04:40.648 --> 01:04:41.616
Yeah, with this, too...

01:04:41.649 --> 01:04:42.951
Okay, step out.

01:04:42.983 --> 01:04:44.084
Oh, man.

01:04:46.688 --> 01:04:48.222
Just one second.

01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:49.990
I'm going
to put this on you.

01:04:50.023 --> 01:04:52.025
- Please hold still.
- Okay.

01:04:56.363 --> 01:04:58.031
Okay.

01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.067
You're a robot.
Fuck her like a robot.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.703
- What?
- Remember, science fiction.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:02.770
Ooh.

01:05:02.804 --> 01:05:04.104
Don't be
a bourgeois realist,

01:05:04.137 --> 01:05:05.205
not in bed, at least.

01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:09.944
Don't look at her.
Look at me.

01:05:09.978 --> 01:05:12.012
Sorry.
You're both so hot.

01:05:12.045 --> 01:05:13.848
- Go faster.
- Okay.

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:16.116
You're an artificial life form.

01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:17.317
Except you're
an early prototype...

01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:19.219
- Faster!
- so you malfunction a lot.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:20.955
No, just don't
listen to her!

01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:24.124
Machinery has adapted to the
weakness of the human being

01:05:24.157 --> 01:05:26.961
so that the weak human being
will become a machine.

01:05:26.995 --> 01:05:29.764
Faster!

01:05:30.932 --> 01:05:32.099
Faster!

01:05:38.038 --> 01:05:40.274
Ugh. Ow.

01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:43.678
Ohh. Get off me.

01:05:43.711 --> 01:05:45.847
Get off.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.048
Fuck.

01:05:48.081 --> 01:05:49.049
Ohh.

01:05:49.082 --> 01:05:50.919
Ohh.

01:05:58.191 --> 01:05:59.827
Hey.

01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:03.263
Where are you going?

01:06:03.297 --> 01:06:05.232
To the shower
to use her shower-head,

01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:07.401
because her robot
malfunctioned.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.992
I've learned
that love is not a feeling

01:06:34.394 --> 01:06:40.400
And I've learned
that all my heroes bleed

01:06:45.873 --> 01:06:47.174
Where is she?

01:06:47.207 --> 01:06:49.043
How many protestors
are there?

01:06:49.077 --> 01:06:50.778
See for yourself.

01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:00.822
Mr. Arista, please take your
guns back into your house.

01:07:00.855 --> 01:07:02.456
There's no law that says
I can't carry

01:07:02.489 --> 01:07:04.291
a licensed weapon
on my own land.

01:07:04.324 --> 01:07:06.761
This is not
about any laws.

01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.830
This is not Winfield
city limits.

01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:10.765
I have no authority
here whatsoever.

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:12.499
What exactly
are they protesting?

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:15.837
People feel that you've
charged extortionary prices

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.270
for your water
for years,

01:07:17.304 --> 01:07:19.306
and now I understand
that you've

01:07:19.339 --> 01:07:21.809
stopped providing it
entirely.

01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:23.410
That's right.

01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:26.914
People also feel that
this wall is antiprogressive

01:07:26.948 --> 01:07:30.084
and presents a
message of superiority

01:07:30.118 --> 01:07:32.152
and lack
of common decency.

01:07:32.185 --> 01:07:35.389
No, trespassing and theft
have left us no choice.

01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:39.794
So, if we no longer desire
to share or sell our water,

01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:41.428
there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:44.932
But we all know
that the relationship

01:07:44.966 --> 01:07:47.101
between your family
and the town

01:07:47.135 --> 01:07:48.903
is old and
far from simple.

01:07:48.936 --> 01:07:52.372
Look, you employ
citizens of Winfield,

01:07:52.406 --> 01:07:55.109
as did your father
a-and his.

01:07:55.143 --> 01:07:57.879
People have been buying water
from your family for generations.

01:07:57.912 --> 01:07:59.346
I drink your water.

01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:02.116
There are dozens of artesian
sources in these hills.

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.918
Why don't you
just have the county

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:05.352
drill more wells
for public use?

01:08:07.021 --> 01:08:08.856
I think you know
quite well

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:10.424
why people want
your water.

01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:12.359
I'd like to hear you
say it out loud

01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:15.195
so we can all agree
how farcical this is.

01:08:15.228 --> 01:08:18.298
I think you know exactly what
the local superstition is

01:08:18.331 --> 01:08:21.234
and why people are
legitimately concerned.

01:08:21.268 --> 01:08:23.004
You see, here we have
a contradiction.

01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:25.505
You can't have
a legitimate concern

01:08:25.538 --> 01:08:27.008
governed
by superstition.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.843
I want you
to say it out loud,

01:08:28.876 --> 01:08:31.344
and I want to know why you
don't have any police down here.

01:08:31.377 --> 01:08:34.314
Look, just take the guns
back into your house.

01:08:34.346 --> 01:08:36.984
As far as I can tell,
these guns

01:08:37.018 --> 01:08:38.886
are why those illiterates
over there

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.321
are still over there and
not overrunning our land.

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:43.256
- No more wall!
- No more wall!

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:45.591
- No more wall!
- ...wall!

01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:48.629
This wall is for them.
Without it, pretty soon,

01:08:48.662 --> 01:08:50.997
there's no well water
for them or anyone else.

01:08:51.032 --> 01:08:54.167
So maybe, if I
get them to leave,

01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:56.170
you'll start selling
the water again.

01:08:56.203 --> 01:08:57.971
For now, no.

01:08:58.005 --> 01:09:00.041
We're running very low because
of thieves from Winfield,

01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:02.643
some of them probably
right over there.

01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.112
- You can't...
- No more wall!

01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:07.180
No more wall!

01:09:07.215 --> 01:09:09.448
They just crossed
on our private property.

01:09:09.483 --> 01:09:10.885
I'm gonna start
shooting feet.

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.120
You should
probably scram.

01:09:12.153 --> 01:09:13.353
I'll help build
this fucker,

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:14.421
but I won't
defend it.

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:15.555
You should
follow my lead

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:17.256
if you want to keep
living in town.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.060
You might want
to cover your ears.

01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:21.194
The report from a shotgun
can cause tinnitus.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:22.362
This is
no longer safe.

01:09:22.395 --> 01:09:23.563
It's okay.
I can handle it.

01:09:23.596 --> 01:09:26.332
Mr. Arista, please,
I'm begging you,

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:28.568
be civilized.

01:09:30.071 --> 01:09:31.571
...calling
Winfield police...

01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:32.974
Stop!

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:35.274
- ...on County Road 11.
- No more wall!

01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:38.979
- No more wall!
- No more wall!

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.952
Hey, don't leave.

01:09:46.254 --> 01:09:48.388
- Hey, guys, no more wall.
- Hey.

01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:50.224
No more wall!

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.962
- They have 60 seconds.
- You better listen to him.

01:09:54.996 --> 01:09:57.031
He really means it
when he starts counting.

01:09:57.064 --> 01:10:00.333
- 55, 54...
- Yes, sir.

01:10:00.367 --> 01:10:01.568
53...

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:03.570
Don.

01:10:03.604 --> 01:10:05.206
- 52...
- Guys, guys,

01:10:05.239 --> 01:10:07.041
- stop. Stop.
- 51...

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.042
You guys calm...

01:10:08.075 --> 01:10:10.510
50, 49...

01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:12.579
48...

01:10:12.613 --> 01:10:15.415
47, 46...

01:10:15.448 --> 01:10:19.452
45, 44...

01:10:19.486 --> 01:10:22.723
43, 42...

01:10:22.757 --> 01:10:25.259
41...

01:10:25.293 --> 01:10:27.061
Hey, fuck you, Enrique!

01:10:27.094 --> 01:10:29.596
Go back,
and fuck your daughters!

01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:32.066
There's nothing
inherently wrong with it

01:10:32.099 --> 01:10:34.068
if you use contraception.

01:10:42.375 --> 01:10:46.113
All right.
Gotta go back and make some calls.

01:10:47.114 --> 01:10:49.283
Make sure
they all leave.

01:10:49.317 --> 01:10:51.384
Here. Help out Don.

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:52.519
Guns are
so outdated.

01:10:56.257 --> 01:10:58.659
And, uh, see if
you can pick up

01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:00.594
a conducted
electrical weapon.

01:11:00.628 --> 01:11:02.129
A what?

01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:03.530
A stun gun.

01:11:06.734 --> 01:11:09.402
Just trust me.
Just... Just leave.

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.371
He's not...

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.242
You were joking,
right?

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.645
What, the incest thing?

01:11:18.746 --> 01:11:21.182
For me,
there's no attraction.

01:11:21.215 --> 01:11:24.018
Tanita might do it
if Papa would.

01:11:24.051 --> 01:11:25.485
He wouldn't, though.

01:11:27.755 --> 01:11:29.489
- We'll be back!
- Right.

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:32.326
Fuck you!

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.661
What an anticlimax.

01:11:33.694 --> 01:11:36.130
One gunshot, and they all
go back to their cars.

01:11:39.066 --> 01:11:40.567
Then again,
most uprisings in history

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:43.304
end in anticlimax.

01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:45.472
We just only hear
about the ones that don't.

01:12:24.577 --> 01:12:26.247
Hey.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.782
Now's not a good time, okay?

01:12:29.116 --> 01:12:31.285
Who says,
you or Tania?

01:12:31.319 --> 01:12:33.721
"You or Tania?"

01:12:33.754 --> 01:12:35.089
"You or Tania?"

01:12:35.122 --> 01:12:36.223
"You or Tania?"

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:41.162
Just leaving, man.
Just leaving.

01:12:47.268 --> 01:12:49.603
I don't speak Spanish, man.

01:12:58.612 --> 01:13:00.181
Just let me talk to her.

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:04.584
Please go guard
the property.

01:13:04.618 --> 01:13:06.220
Those protestors
might come back.

01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:07.688
Come on.

01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:10.791
Not tonight, okay?

01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:12.592
- Hey...
- Not tonight.

01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:15.129
Yeah.

01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:18.265
Yeah, I guess
tonight's a bad night

01:13:18.299 --> 01:13:20.801
for me to not do my job.

01:13:20.835 --> 01:13:22.336
There you go.

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:23.536
Good night.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.571
Yeah.

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:26.841
Yeah.

01:14:13.387 --> 01:14:14.455
What?

01:14:16.323 --> 01:14:17.858
Raccoons.

01:14:26.767 --> 01:14:29.270
I'm so depressed.

01:14:30.771 --> 01:14:32.973
That's addiction, Tanita.

01:14:33.007 --> 01:14:37.011
Your brain needs more and more
stimulation to feel content.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.617
But I am so, so sad.

01:14:43.651 --> 01:14:45.319
Mm-hmm.

01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:48.823
Sad.

01:14:48.856 --> 01:14:50.558
Not sad.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.460
Sad.

01:14:52.493 --> 01:14:54.528
Not sad.

01:14:54.562 --> 01:14:55.529
Sad.

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:57.264
Not sad.

01:14:57.298 --> 01:14:58.598
- Sad.
- Mm, stop it.

01:14:58.632 --> 01:14:59.967
- Stop it.
- Not sad.

01:15:03.771 --> 01:15:05.573
Well, I'm sad, too.

01:15:06.674 --> 01:15:08.909
Papa's wall
is not working.

01:15:11.846 --> 01:15:14.715
The other night, I was
driving back from Vegas.

01:15:14.748 --> 01:15:16.250
Mm-hmm.

01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:18.252
I put on your echoey
piano playlist.

01:15:18.285 --> 01:15:19.487
Mm-hmm.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.557
And there was
a silent ambulance ahead...

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:27.328
for, like, 50 minutes

01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:31.031
with its light on,
but the highway was empty.

01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:34.502
And that made you sad?

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:35.536
No.

01:15:38.005 --> 01:15:41.475
It made me
the thing before sad

01:15:41.509 --> 01:15:43.410
that there
isn't a name for.

01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:47.047
The foyer of sad.

01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:50.050
The cloakroom of sad.

01:15:50.084 --> 01:15:52.386
The House of Saud.

01:15:52.419 --> 01:15:54.421
The House of Saud.

01:15:54.455 --> 01:15:55.456
S-Saud.

01:15:55.489 --> 01:15:56.457
- Stop it.
- Saud.

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:57.791
Stop saying that.

01:15:59.693 --> 01:16:03.964
It's a nice paradox how human
sadness is no less common

01:16:03.998 --> 01:16:05.933
the more the population
is protected

01:16:05.966 --> 01:16:09.703
from things like war
and starvation

01:16:09.737 --> 01:16:10.738
and disease
and exploitation...

01:16:10.771 --> 01:16:11.906
Are you
listening to me?

01:16:11.939 --> 01:16:13.340
Yes, Tania,
I'm listening to you.

01:16:13.374 --> 01:16:14.909
Okay. Let me finish.

01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:16.010
Okay, go.

01:16:17.044 --> 01:16:19.046
Okay.

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.514
So, with an ambulance,

01:16:20.548 --> 01:16:23.484
there's supposed to be
a siren, right?

01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:24.785
Mm.

01:16:24.818 --> 01:16:28.856
So the lack of that did
something wrong to me.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:31.692
Or to time.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:38.633
And I felt like
I was an echo...

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.038
being dragged for so long
behind a silent ambulance.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.808
I felt certain

01:16:47.841 --> 01:16:50.679
that I was in the
future, dying in it.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.549
Dying in the ambulance
or dying in the future?

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:57.985
Both.

01:18:14.729 --> 01:18:15.996
Seem more dead.

01:18:18.565 --> 01:18:22.436
Your manikin
is tired and cold.

01:18:22.469 --> 01:18:25.472
Just hold still
a few years.

01:18:25.506 --> 01:18:27.541
Global warming.

01:18:27.574 --> 01:18:28.575
You'll be fine.

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:34.014
Maybe that's why
the well's dropping still.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:36.884
Maybe nobody's stealing
much from it at all.

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:44.591
Do you think everyone
here who isn't poor

01:18:44.626 --> 01:18:47.662
will have to move
somewhere north

01:18:47.696 --> 01:18:49.830
in, like, 30 years?

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.232
Not 30, no.

01:18:52.266 --> 01:18:54.769
Papa bought land
in Alaska.

01:18:54.803 --> 01:18:57.137
Really? When?

01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.708
Last year.

01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:03.010
I couldn't live
anywhere but here.

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:11.044
That'll keep
the claim jumpers out.

01:20:11.078 --> 01:20:13.080
Be here
when the world ends.

01:20:14.849 --> 01:20:17.951
She's been driving up the
price per gallon, too.

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:20.554
Henry says
the well's

01:20:20.587 --> 01:20:22.156
still dropping,
though.

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:24.859
Henry's pissed.

01:20:25.993 --> 01:20:27.261
Ah, let him be.

01:20:27.294 --> 01:20:29.563
It's good for him.

01:20:29.596 --> 01:20:30.732
Yeah.

01:20:32.132 --> 01:20:33.934
What's wrong with you?

01:20:33.967 --> 01:20:37.271
You're even poorer company
than your usual worthless self.

01:20:41.241 --> 01:20:43.277
You can tell me,
you dumb kid.

01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:44.712
Huh?

01:20:44.746 --> 01:20:46.380
Ah...

01:20:53.721 --> 01:20:55.222
The girls
won't talk to me.

01:20:55.255 --> 01:20:58.292
Peanut brain.
What did I tell you about that?

01:20:58.325 --> 01:20:59.694
Yeah, but...

01:20:59.727 --> 01:21:01.261
You wanna get laid off?

01:21:02.362 --> 01:21:04.097
You wanna get laid
or laid off?

01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:05.834
What's wrong
with your simple head?

01:21:05.867 --> 01:21:07.669
Yeah, but I
already got laid.

01:21:07.702 --> 01:21:09.303
Bullshit
on a hill of shit.

01:21:09.336 --> 01:21:11.639
Whatever. I did, though.

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:12.807
Which one?

01:21:14.107 --> 01:21:16.043
Both, kinda.

01:21:16.076 --> 01:21:18.780
I-I guess just Tania.

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:21.281
Nah.

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.218
Whatever you want
to believe, man.

01:21:24.251 --> 01:21:27.889
Magic, aliens,

01:21:27.922 --> 01:21:30.057
Jesus Christ,

01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:31.759
Fountain of Youth.

01:21:31.793 --> 01:21:34.394
You name it,
I believe in it.

01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:13.801
<i>Papa!</i>

01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:15.269
Papa!

01:22:16.704 --> 01:22:18.305
Papa!

01:22:18.338 --> 01:22:19.674
Papa!

01:22:19.707 --> 01:22:20.708
Papa!

01:22:24.278 --> 01:22:26.113
- Traitor.
- ...call me?

01:22:26.146 --> 01:22:27.447
- I worked for your grandfather.
- Traitor. Traitor.

01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:29.049
I heard you
filling it up.

01:22:29.082 --> 01:22:30.785
- What were you doing...
- What's going on?

01:22:30.818 --> 01:22:32.219
Fixing the enamel on your
mother's goddamn vanity.

01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:33.287
Oh, with a jug of water?

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.789
With a jug
of whatever I want.

01:22:34.822 --> 01:22:36.290
What's going on?

01:22:36.323 --> 01:22:38.191
He's probably been selling
it in town for years.

01:22:38.225 --> 01:22:40.160
- What's the trouble here?
- Well, the mystery is solved.

01:22:40.193 --> 01:22:42.129
He's why the wall isn't
keeping the well full.

01:22:42.162 --> 01:22:45.365
- Right.
- Oh, and he controls the CCTV computer,

01:22:45.399 --> 01:22:47.334
and he's probably been
working with those thieves.

01:22:47.367 --> 01:22:49.202
That's libel.

01:22:49.236 --> 01:22:51.773
Laws against accusing people
of things like that.

01:22:51.806 --> 01:22:53.473
Let me taste it, Michael.

01:22:53.507 --> 01:22:55.810
No, I won't.

01:22:55.843 --> 01:22:57.879
I won't
stoop myself to it.

01:22:57.912 --> 01:22:58.880
"Stoop myself"?

01:22:58.913 --> 01:23:00.748
Who says,
"Stoop myself"?

01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:02.115
Michael, you have
nothing to hide,

01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:03.383
so let me
just taste the water,

01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:05.787
and my daughters
will apologize.

01:23:07.454 --> 01:23:08.823
I'm going home.

01:23:08.856 --> 01:23:10.892
Not until
I taste that water.

01:23:10.925 --> 01:23:12.760
No, I won't dignify it.

01:23:13.828 --> 01:23:14.929
Well...

01:23:14.963 --> 01:23:16.731
then, we'll have
to let you go.

01:23:19.867 --> 01:23:21.903
You're fucking crazy.

01:23:21.936 --> 01:23:25.405
- I knew he had more money than...
- You're all cabin fever wacko.

01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:27.842
It's very simple
to solve this.

01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:30.410
Hey, Mike,
just let him taste it.

01:23:30.444 --> 01:23:32.145
- Don, please.
- You can taste my ass.

01:23:32.179 --> 01:23:33.781
- Michael.
- I won't do it.

01:23:36.918 --> 01:23:38.820
Then, we'll have
to let you go.

01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:44.025
You hypocrite.

01:23:45.158 --> 01:23:46.828
You ruined your children,
you know?

01:23:47.996 --> 01:23:51.431
Your daughters are wolves,
not people.

01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:53.101
Oh, I like that.

01:23:53.133 --> 01:23:54.534
Scorpions would have
been more poetic.

01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:55.970
No, I don't
like scorpions.

01:23:56.004 --> 01:23:58.438
- Piranhas, I like...
- Stop.

01:23:58.472 --> 01:24:02.977
Okay. I can see we've
finished our arrangement.

01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:05.780
Put the jug down,
and go home,

01:24:05.813 --> 01:24:08.116
and I'll have somebody
drop off your belongings

01:24:08.148 --> 01:24:10.517
and a check for this
and next month's pay.

01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:14.488
Hope your well dries up,

01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:18.026
you all get colon cancer,
something awful.

01:24:18.059 --> 01:24:20.227
Put the jug down.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.461
Fuck you.

01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:24.431
I'll use it
to pay for a lawyer.

01:24:34.942 --> 01:24:35.977
I'm 'a go talk to him,

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:37.045
- if you want.
- No. No, thanks.

01:24:37.078 --> 01:24:39.080
It's okay.

01:24:39.113 --> 01:24:43.851
Please, just make sure
he leaves the property.

01:24:43.885 --> 01:24:45.285
And change
the gate code.

01:24:45.318 --> 01:24:46.319
Okay.

01:24:52.592 --> 01:24:54.594
- Hey.
- Get off of me.

01:25:12.512 --> 01:25:14.949
Does Henry know
you have this many horses?

01:25:14.982 --> 01:25:16.283
Hell, no.

01:25:17.484 --> 01:25:19.453
I'll talk to them
again tomorrow.

01:25:19.486 --> 01:25:21.488
- They don't want...
- They don't want what?

01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:23.891
And why does Henry
have you over here already

01:25:23.925 --> 01:25:25.525
with my fuckin' check?

01:25:25.559 --> 01:25:27.662
They're nuttier than squirrel
shit, all four of 'em.

01:25:30.164 --> 01:25:32.200
So is the water, I mean...

01:25:32.232 --> 01:25:34.035
I mean, what's the...

01:25:34.068 --> 01:25:36.003
You haven't
tried it yet?

01:25:36.037 --> 01:25:37.038
Nope.

01:25:38.371 --> 01:25:40.908
Man, you're
an honest little dope.

01:25:44.377 --> 01:25:46.513
Hey, you know, I'm starting
my own contracting company.

01:25:46.546 --> 01:25:48.182
Why don't you
come work for me?

01:25:48.216 --> 01:25:50.017
You pay
as good as Henry?

01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:51.518
Twice as much respect.

01:25:53.688 --> 01:25:55.223
Rather have
some money.

01:25:58.025 --> 01:25:59.994
Ah, you're
just head over ass

01:26:00.027 --> 01:26:02.362
for those two <i>putas,</i>
aren't you?

01:26:04.165 --> 01:26:07.334
Nah. They won't even
talk to me anymore.

01:26:07.367 --> 01:26:09.237
Told you.

01:26:10.504 --> 01:26:12.405
Someone should
kidnap 'em both

01:26:12.439 --> 01:26:15.076
and sell 'em into
human trafficking.

01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:17.477
Fuck Henry.

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:19.546
I ought to dynamite
that wall.

01:26:23.017 --> 01:26:25.219
Hell'll
break loose soon enough.

01:26:25.253 --> 01:26:27.387
Townies'll be back.

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.124
Something'll snap.

01:26:30.158 --> 01:26:31.324
Me.

01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:34.128
Maybe you.

01:26:35.328 --> 01:26:37.064
Me?

01:26:37.098 --> 01:26:39.366
Yeah. You know...

01:26:39.399 --> 01:26:41.401
everything's got
a breaking point.

01:26:43.004 --> 01:26:46.607
People, can't treat
people like they do.

01:26:50.611 --> 01:26:51.979
Not me.

01:27:01.222 --> 01:27:03.191
Um, so, uh...

01:27:04.192 --> 01:27:05.726
were you?

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.360
- What?
- Stealing?

01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:08.629
The magic water?

01:27:08.663 --> 01:27:10.097
"Magic water."

01:27:10.131 --> 01:27:11.165
Such a dopey kid.

01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:13.167
Well, were you?

01:27:14.168 --> 01:27:16.570
Mm, maybe.

01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:18.538
I mean, yes.

01:27:20.074 --> 01:27:21.374
How the hell else
am I supposed

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:24.078
to feed my kids,
my horses

01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:28.249
a red pussy hair
above the minimum wage?

01:27:28.282 --> 01:27:29.750
I've seen that.

01:27:29.784 --> 01:27:32.119
No benefits and...

01:27:32.153 --> 01:27:33.654
Seen what?

01:27:35.256 --> 01:27:36.523
Red.

01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:40.027
Jesus.

01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:42.330
You don't know the
first thing about women,

01:27:42.362 --> 01:27:44.431
money, politics...

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:48.501
sky being blue...

01:27:48.535 --> 01:27:50.671
what kind of boots to
put on in the morning.

01:27:50.705 --> 01:27:52.306
Fuck you, man.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.643
What kind of boots
am I supposed to?

01:27:59.647 --> 01:28:01.481
This kind.

01:29:49.223 --> 01:29:50.490
Gotcha.

01:29:54.762 --> 01:29:55.863
What?

01:29:55.896 --> 01:29:57.298
I'm only tasting it.

01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:59.532
I just wanted to see
what the big deal was.

01:30:01.534 --> 01:30:03.404
Don't tell your parents.

01:30:04.839 --> 01:30:06.539
Hey. Hey.

01:30:08.943 --> 01:30:10.444
Wh-What the fuck?

01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:14.315
What'd I ever do to you?

01:30:15.383 --> 01:30:17.517
Stop walking!

01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:19.586
Don't be a fucking
bitch, okay?

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.588
Hey! Stop walking.

01:30:21.622 --> 01:30:23.958
Tania! Tania!

01:30:24.959 --> 01:30:26.293
Hey, I-I'll tell your dad

01:30:26.327 --> 01:30:27.628
you snort that fucked-up
black cocaine!

01:30:46.781 --> 01:30:48.215
Look, I know.

01:30:48.249 --> 01:30:49.350
I'm sorry, okay?

01:30:49.383 --> 01:30:51.485
I am sorry.
It was just a small sip.

01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:53.788
I was just curious,
what with firing Mike

01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:55.256
a-and the wall and all.

01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:56.724
I've spoken
to my husband,

01:30:56.757 --> 01:30:58.426
and I've spoken
to my daughters.

01:30:58.459 --> 01:30:59.927
We've decided,
as a family,

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.229
to hire
some new staff.

01:31:02.263 --> 01:31:04.698
Monica, please.
I need this job.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.768
You can't
just fire everyone...

01:31:07.802 --> 01:31:09.470
It's been decided.

01:31:09.503 --> 01:31:12.473
What? All I did is just take
one little sip of water.

01:31:12.506 --> 01:31:14.475
I just wanted to know
what the big deal was.

01:31:14.508 --> 01:31:17.745
You're so rich, you can't afford
just one little sip of water?

01:31:17.778 --> 01:31:19.713
It's not
about the water.

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:23.784
Then what is it, then?

01:31:25.419 --> 01:31:27.587
It's your conduct
towards my daughters.

01:31:29.657 --> 01:31:31.625
What?

01:31:31.659 --> 01:31:34.628
They told me about
your unwelcome advances.

01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:38.365
Unwelcome adv...

01:31:39.967 --> 01:31:41.402
Are you serious?

01:31:42.937 --> 01:31:44.238
Very much so.

01:31:44.271 --> 01:31:46.340
Ah. Okay.

01:31:46.373 --> 01:31:47.608
Yeah, all right.

01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:49.643
Okay, excuse me.

01:31:49.677 --> 01:31:51.445
Bullshit.

01:31:51.479 --> 01:31:53.380
Calm down, please.

01:31:53.414 --> 01:31:54.915
We're... We're happy
to extend

01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.350
some severance pay
for you.

01:31:56.383 --> 01:31:58.619
We're very happy
to do that.

01:32:00.788 --> 01:32:01.889
It was the water.

01:32:01.922 --> 01:32:03.057
It wasn't the water.

01:32:04.058 --> 01:32:05.326
Hmm?

01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:06.794
You could fire me
if you want,

01:32:06.827 --> 01:32:08.462
but at least
be honest about it.

01:32:08.496 --> 01:32:09.830
It's not your daughters.

01:32:09.864 --> 01:32:11.565
It's the fucking water.

01:32:11.599 --> 01:32:13.501
I'm going
to go get Henry.

01:32:13.534 --> 01:32:15.436
Henry can
explain this to you.

01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:17.972
You know,
your cokehead daughters

01:32:18.005 --> 01:32:20.474
practically begged me
to have sex with them,

01:32:20.508 --> 01:32:22.476
and then I just take
one small sip, and...

01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:25.779
And you, you can't treat
people the way you do!

01:32:25.813 --> 01:32:27.414
Stop walking!

01:32:27.448 --> 01:32:28.549
I'll do something!

01:32:28.582 --> 01:32:29.984
Stop walking!

01:32:30.017 --> 01:32:31.620
I'll do something!

01:32:31.652 --> 01:32:33.521
Stop walking!

01:32:33.554 --> 01:32:36.423
I will do something!

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.968
Stop!

01:33:23.837 --> 01:33:24.838
Wait!

01:33:26.407 --> 01:33:28.709
No! No!

01:33:28.742 --> 01:33:30.010
What are you doing?!

01:33:30.044 --> 01:33:31.712
Stop!

01:33:31.745 --> 01:33:33.615
What are you doing?!

01:33:33.648 --> 01:33:35.082
- No!
- Stop!

01:33:35.115 --> 01:33:36.417
Stop!

01:33:44.825 --> 01:33:46.493
Oh, my God.
No, no, no.

01:33:46.527 --> 01:33:47.494
No, no.

01:34:18.559 --> 01:34:23.097
Looking at you
in the cold morning light

01:34:25.634 --> 01:34:30.004
Looking so pale,
and cheeks so, so white

01:34:31.005 --> 01:34:33.440
I never intended

01:34:33.474 --> 01:34:37.578
To kill you last night

01:34:40.114 --> 01:34:42.483
I know about Willie

01:34:42.516 --> 01:34:44.753
And what you have done

01:34:47.054 --> 01:34:51.892
Oh, Emily, I believed
I was the only one

01:34:52.893 --> 01:34:54.862
Today and forever

01:34:54.895 --> 01:34:57.097
You ain't seeing...

01:35:01.001 --> 01:35:02.169
What does it say?

01:35:02.202 --> 01:35:04.471
It says that
my clients agree

01:35:04.505 --> 01:35:07.474
not to get the police
involved in any way,

01:35:07.508 --> 01:35:10.077
not to press charges
for attempted murder.

01:35:10.110 --> 01:35:12.046
- Hmm?
- It also says that you agree

01:35:12.079 --> 01:35:13.615
that you asked
Henry Arista

01:35:13.648 --> 01:35:15.549
to stun-gun you,
and, when he did...

01:35:15.582 --> 01:35:17.217
- Is your dad coming?
- No.

01:35:17.251 --> 01:35:18.919
- Tania?
- No.

01:35:18.952 --> 01:35:21.121
It also says
that he asked you

01:35:21.155 --> 01:35:23.023
to pour insecticide
into his well

01:35:23.057 --> 01:35:25.059
as a part
of an elaborate game

01:35:25.092 --> 01:35:27.662
involving
theatrical elements.

01:35:27.696 --> 01:35:28.862
What?

01:35:28.896 --> 01:35:30.898
It means that you'll
never go to jail

01:35:30.931 --> 01:35:32.767
for attempted murder
of my whole family.

01:35:32.801 --> 01:35:34.835
Just read it all the way
to the bottom, and sign.

01:35:34.868 --> 01:35:35.869
Attempted murder?
Who did...

01:35:35.903 --> 01:35:37.838
Who did I
attempt to murder?

01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:40.608
The Arista family.
You premeditatedly

01:35:40.642 --> 01:35:42.543
poisoned their
drinking water.

01:35:42.576 --> 01:35:44.078
But it says
right there

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:46.914
that they agree
you did no such thing.

01:35:48.015 --> 01:35:49.883
What's "premeditatedly"?

01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:51.218
That you planned it.

01:35:52.219 --> 01:35:53.520
Oh.

01:36:01.962 --> 01:36:04.164
I didn't plan anything.

01:36:04.198 --> 01:36:07.534
I just was freaking out,
just...

01:36:08.737 --> 01:36:10.237
I didn't mean
to ruin anything.

01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:12.873
Your family's so great.

01:36:12.906 --> 01:36:14.241
You did, however,

01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:16.577
so will you
sign it, please?

01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:18.613
I just wanted
a little drink of water.

01:36:18.646 --> 01:36:21.850
I just wanted to be
part of everything.

01:36:21.882 --> 01:36:24.719
Just, uh, read it,
and sign.

01:36:28.723 --> 01:36:30.859
Are you all
gonna get old now?

01:36:37.564 --> 01:36:40.167
It was always
only a wishing well.

01:36:45.939 --> 01:36:47.307
What does that mean?

01:36:48.676 --> 01:36:50.779
There's no such thing
as paradise.

01:36:51.979 --> 01:36:54.281
Then how do you all
look so young, then?

01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:57.951
Money, dermal fillers,
plastic surgery.

01:36:59.654 --> 01:37:02.256
So I-I didn't ruin
your family, then?

01:37:02.289 --> 01:37:08.095
You don't have the power
to ruin my family.

01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:12.266
Why'd we build a wall, then?

01:37:12.299 --> 01:37:16.003
We built a wall
around a myth.

01:37:16.036 --> 01:37:17.906
Most myths
are toxic, anyway.

01:37:17.938 --> 01:37:19.641
You merely added
real poison.

01:37:19.674 --> 01:37:22.610
No. I don't believe you.

01:37:22.644 --> 01:37:24.679
Nobody looks like you do
at your age.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.980
You don't believe me?

01:37:27.014 --> 01:37:28.917
No. Hey, I'm not an idiot.

01:37:28.949 --> 01:37:31.151
I know the water
makes you not get old.

01:37:31.185 --> 01:37:33.621
Does it?

01:37:33.655 --> 01:37:35.122
Well, it probably
gives you cancer now,

01:37:35.155 --> 01:37:36.724
thanks to you
and your stupidity.

01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:38.626
- Ximena.
- My stupidity.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.060
- Good. I'm glad. I'm glad.
- Ximena.

01:37:40.093 --> 01:37:42.897
You know, you don't
deserve to not get old.

01:37:42.931 --> 01:37:44.131
You almost
have my sympathy.

01:37:44.164 --> 01:37:46.066
You're...
You're like a dog.

01:37:46.099 --> 01:37:47.334
Ximena, can we
get back to...

01:37:47.367 --> 01:37:50.304
Okay, let me explain
the 21st century to you.

01:37:50.337 --> 01:37:53.675
My family
has investments,

01:37:53.708 --> 01:37:55.342
real estate,
bitcoin,

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:59.246
commodity futures,
catastrophe bonds, um...

01:38:00.648 --> 01:38:01.749
As the world
gets hotter

01:38:01.783 --> 01:38:03.250
and more populated
and less educated,

01:38:03.283 --> 01:38:06.119
we will be able to afford
whatever unfair technologies

01:38:06.153 --> 01:38:08.355
continue to divide the
wealthy from the poor.

01:38:08.388 --> 01:38:10.357
Our children,
if we have any,

01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:13.160
will be safer
and taller

01:38:13.193 --> 01:38:15.730
and smarter
than your children.

01:38:15.763 --> 01:38:18.766
We will have
well passed 100,

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.400
with or without
well water.

01:38:22.169 --> 01:38:24.071
You're evil.

01:38:24.104 --> 01:38:27.341
In a binary world of black
and white distinctions,

01:38:27.374 --> 01:38:29.711
yes, yes,
I guess I am.

01:38:30.712 --> 01:38:31.880
Somebody should kill you.

01:38:31.913 --> 01:38:32.981
Are you
threatening my client?

01:38:33.013 --> 01:38:34.081
- No, competition...
- No.

01:38:34.114 --> 01:38:35.650
and self-interest,
yes, yes,

01:38:35.683 --> 01:38:37.785
probably
somebody should.

01:38:37.819 --> 01:38:39.954
You know,
if they could get past my wall.

01:38:44.024 --> 01:38:45.392
You're evil.

01:38:46.694 --> 01:38:48.128
I'm just telling you
the truth.

01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:51.833
I'm not condoning it
or celebrating it.

01:38:51.866 --> 01:38:54.201
Enough. Let's get this done.

01:38:55.369 --> 01:38:57.271
I hope
somebody kills you.

01:39:00.975 --> 01:39:03.176
I hope
someone offers you

01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:05.013
a glass of water
from a magic well

01:39:05.045 --> 01:39:07.214
that grants
not longevity,

01:39:07.247 --> 01:39:11.184
but the capacity
to fathom irony

01:39:11.218 --> 01:39:14.221
and complex, insoluble
zero-sum problems.

01:39:14.254 --> 01:39:16.724
I hope somebody kills you.

01:39:20.127 --> 01:39:23.063
Saying the same thing twice is
not inherently a waste of breath.

01:40:41.169 --> 01:40:46.169
