00:05.080 --> 00:06.720
In the spring of 1918,

00:06.920 --> 00:09.680
Nicholas II, deposed Tsar of all the
Russias,

00:09.880 --> 00:13.000
was brought, together with his wife
and five children...

00:15.280 --> 00:17.240
..to the city of Ekaterinburg...

00:19.480 --> 00:22.240
..where they were executed
by their Bolshevik captors.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.400
Jab!

00:45.800 --> 00:48.080
When the dead were examined,

00:48.320 --> 00:53.680
it was found that the women had concealed
about their bodies gold and jewels.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.720
Go ahead, caller.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.160
Commissioned as a 16th birthday
present

01:01.320 --> 01:03.160
for the Grand Duchess Anastasia,

01:03.320 --> 01:04.800
I give you...

01:05.680 --> 01:07.200
Innocence.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.720
Or Nastya's Egg.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.520
Oh, good Lord. Look. You! Up on the
roof!

01:58.800 --> 02:03.800
Five, four, three, two, one.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.160
Thus, after almost 100 years,

02:08.360 --> 02:12.240
the long and distinguished history
of Oxford City Police...

02:13.280 --> 02:14.360
..is ended.

02:21.160 --> 02:26.640
The motto of the new constabulary is
"sit pax in valle tamesis".

02:26.840 --> 02:29.800
For the benefit of the
non-classicists amongst us,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.040
Detective Sergeant Morse has kindly
provided a translation. Morse?

02:34.240 --> 02:36.560
He's on a shout, sir. Handbag
snatch.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.120
Oh.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.440
Found by the beat man just after six.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.920
No ID on him. Car's leased.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.800
Waiting on the firm's offices opening
before we can say who to.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.880
That's Joey Sikes.
Do you know him, sir?

04:28.040 --> 04:29.120
We've had dealings.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.440
Ex-boxer. Decent right but slow on
his feet.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.920
I saw him at the undercard at White City
when Bruce Woodcock beat Freddie Mills.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.520
He lost that night too.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.960
- Who lives here?
- No reply.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.760
Still working door-to-door.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.600
Doctor.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.440
Gentlemen.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.440
Shot. Three times.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.360
Twice in the chest and once in the
back.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.240
From close range.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.600
Somewhere between midnight and four
o'clock.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.360
Someone inside the car, then?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.800
Can't say if those were lethal
until I've had a gander.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.440
Not likely to be anything
else, is it?

05:03.640 --> 05:06.480
Unlikely he'd survive a metal spike
being driven into his ear.

05:06.680 --> 05:11.240
Whether that was insult to injury
remains to be seen.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.360
.38 calibre in the glove compartment.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.120
Recently discharged.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.000
Nobody saw or heard anything?

05:17.200 --> 05:19.360
There was a party in the warehouse
down the end.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.640
Loud music.
Between that and the thunderstorm...

05:22.840 --> 05:25.000
He's had a woman in the car at some
point too.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.040
Cocktail cigarettes ringed with
lipstick. Right.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.600
You press on here with the
door-to-door. I'll brief Mr Bright.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.640
Joey Sikes, sir.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.360
Gunned down on Holywell Lane.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.680
A falling-out amongst the criminal
fraternity?

05:47.840 --> 05:49.600
Certainly looks that way, sir.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.280
I don't want people thinking our reorganisation
is an opportunity for them to make hay.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.280
I'll make that clear, sir.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.760
There was one more thing.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.800
About the Morse situation.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.040
We've got a number at Lonsdale,
looks like.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.840
What kind of number? Attempted
burglary from the sounds of it.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.720
Shirl's on the scene. She'll fill
you in. I can finish up here.

06:25.560 --> 06:29.840
Morning. Intruder spotted on the roof
by the master and one of the dons last night.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.880
Why didn't they call it in then?
Thought it might be a drunken undergrad.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.920
But this morning a scout found this.
Appears he left empty-handed.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.840
I've had a look topside. This was the
only thing up there.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.920
An unusual spot for an auction.
It's an unusual bequest.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.240
Not every day a college is left an
object of virtue.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.080
"Innocence. Also known as Nastya's
Egg."

06:56.240 --> 06:57.680
Faberge's last great masterpiece.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.720
It was lost for 50 years.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.200
And now bequeathed to us by a late
graduate.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.320
Its value to be realised to the
benefit of the college.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.920
DS Morse. Thames Valley CID.
What's it expected to fetch?

07:10.080 --> 07:11.720
A reserve is set at 30,000.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.560
If the provenance is to be believed.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.680
It's reliable. Robin Grey.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.200
Dr Grey is a great authority on
Russian Imperial jewellery.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.680
He's been instrumental in establishing
the veracity of the original designs.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.480
Any news on this burglar?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.040
We found this.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.160
But that's The Shadow's calling
card, isn't it?

07:32.360 --> 07:35.120
The what?
An international art thief.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.360
He leaves a rose at the scene of his
crimes. If he exists.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.200
That's all a bit Simon Templar, don't
you think?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.600
He's real enough to Interpol.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.320
The Lugash Diamond, the Golden
Dagger of Sultan Mahmud.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.880
Or are you saying none of these
things were stolen?

07:50.120 --> 07:54.360
I'm sure they were stolen, but whether or not by
the same person is another matter entirely.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.560
Well, we'll step up the beat patrol
until the auction is concluded.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.480
In the meantime, keep it under lock
and key and not just on display.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.000
Unless you want it lost for another
50 years.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.360
Detective Sergeant Morse.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.560
I never knew you cared. So what was
he after?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.400
The Faberge? Who?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.720
The Shadow!

08:19.960 --> 08:23.720
I think, given the date, we're
looking at something less criminal altogether.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.760
April Fool's.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.600
For a cracksman of international
renown,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.976
it was hardly a case of "now you see
me, now you don't".

08:30.000 --> 08:31.880
What's this other business on
Holywell Lane?

08:32.080 --> 08:35.480
I heard something on the police
band. It sounded serious.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.600
Murder usually is. But before you ask me more,
a full statement will be released in time.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.400
Simon Lake. Art dealer.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.680
He's handling the sale of the
Faberge on behalf of the owners.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.320
So, murder, cat burglary - you're
earning those stripes.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.720
I've earned these stripes many times.
Seriously, how are you finding it?

08:57.160 --> 08:59.120
Just another tick in the box.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.360
I thought there'd be... I don't
know...

09:02.520 --> 09:04.400
Something more. Hm.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.800
How'd you make out at Lonsdale?
Something and nothing.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.520
April Fool, by the look of it.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.680
Hello?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
Is this your desk? Sorry.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.480
Um... I was told to come up and wait.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.040
Fancy, is it?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.440
George Fancy. Detective Constable.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.240
DCI Thursday.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.240
Sergeant Strange. DS Morse'll be
showing you around.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.840
He's a good man, so watch, listen and
learn.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.560
We'll find you a desk, don't worry
about that.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.840
Anything more on this door-to-door?

09:54.040 --> 09:57.720
A neighbour said she saw a woman in
a white raincoat getting out the car

09:57.920 --> 09:59.520
and heading up the mews to the
party.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.320
Looks like you had it right, matey.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.440
Blonde or brunette? Couldn't say.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.480
She had a scarf on.

10:05.720 --> 10:11.120
But I have got a last-known residence for
Joey off his parole officer. The Alhambra.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.800
There we are. Your first job,
Constable.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.840
You can keep Morse company.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.160
Do your work, mind your Ps and Qs
and you won't go far wrong.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.360
I'm used to working alone, sir.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.400
He'd learn more from you.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.000
I expect he would.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.640
But you've got rank now. That brings
responsibilities.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.680
Show him the ropes. Get to know him
a bit. It'll do him good.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.120
Mr Bright had a word about your
situation.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.160
I wasn't aware I had one.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.320
Two Detective Sergeants would,
ordinarily, be surplus in a nick of this size.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.480
But right now, Division's got other
fish to fry.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.920
Thought you'd be pleased.
A reprieve's not a pardon.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.640
I'd as soon not wait another six
months for the other shoe to drop.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.680
Beggars can't.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.960
Look, none of us know how the chips
are gonna land till this reorganisation's done.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.000
Just take it one day at a time.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.960
Want me to drive? No.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.720
Anything? Quiet as the proverbial.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.720
Detective Constable Fancy. WPC
Trewlove.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.720
George. Pleased to meet you.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.680
What's a pretty girl like you doing
in a place like this?

11:28.840 --> 11:30.520
My job.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.720
Hard to get, eh?

11:33.880 --> 11:35.360
Oh, you've no idea.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.200
I like a challenge.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.880
Idiot.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.160
Blimey! She's a bit of all right!

11:47.360 --> 11:49.880
Don't you reckon? Who, Constable
Trewlove?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.920
She's a very capable officer. Doesn't
suffer fools.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.400
So... this is Sikes's place, is it?

12:06.040 --> 12:09.800
Good nick, is it? Decent mates?
If you go in for that sort of thing.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.120
Don't you, then?

12:12.320 --> 12:14.520
It's why I joined the job - the
social life.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.800
And the er... crumpet.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.400
Of course.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.360
Got any hobbies?

12:23.280 --> 12:26.680
Do you like sport? I don't go in for
small talk, Constable.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.840
George. Or first names.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.600
Let's just keep it to work and we'll
get along fine.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.560
Very good.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.280
That's very nice.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.320
Very nice.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.080
What a good boy am I?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.520
Three bullets, .38 calibre.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
Any of which would have proved fatal.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.440
Why bother with the ear business?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.800
Some sort of underworld message?

13:39.960 --> 13:41.160
Hear no evil, perhaps?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.960
Something from the building trade?

13:44.160 --> 13:47.080
Whatever it is, it would have needed
a hammer to drive it into the skull.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.120
Anything else?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.480
A smooch of lipstick.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.360
Rain and the cobbles had got rid of
most of it.

14:13.880 --> 14:18.120
Good afternoon. This is the message
service for 938126. Go ahead, caller.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.520
Good afternoon. It's Dr Grey here.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.360
I'd like to leave a message, please.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.960
So that's eight o'clock at
the club with Dr Grey.

14:35.800 --> 14:35.901
♪♪

14:39.980 --> 14:43.300
Get that lot dusted for prints and
the contents logged and booked in.

14:45.740 --> 14:47.700
Leaving us already, George?

14:47.860 --> 14:49.980
Joey Sikes' worldly possessions.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.420
Mainly prophylactics and contact
mags.

14:52.620 --> 14:56.380
Got a lead on his motor. Registered
to Magdalen Cabs.

14:56.580 --> 14:59.620
Isn't that a front for Eddie Nero's
criminal activities?

14:59.780 --> 15:01.660
One of 'em.

15:10.020 --> 15:12.220
Easy, easy. Hello, Eddie.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.980
Take a breather. Ah, what's this,
then, Fred?

15:16.060 --> 15:17.980
You've come to go a few rounds, have
you?

15:18.140 --> 15:20.940
Maybe later. You know the boys.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.540
Yeah. Looks like you're a man short.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.780
Joey Sikes.

15:25.940 --> 15:27.900
When did you see him last? Joey?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.420
Couldn't say.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.900
But everything was just jake between
you?

15:32.060 --> 15:34.020
Oh, yeah. Are you sure about that?

15:34.260 --> 15:38.060
He was found this morning with three
bullets in him and a spike in his shell-like.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.900
Any idea what he was doing parked up
on Holywell Lane?

15:42.100 --> 15:44.260
Search me.
He was in one of your cars.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.380
I'd give him the lend of a set of
wheels from time to time.

15:47.540 --> 15:49.180
What about lady friends?

15:49.340 --> 15:50.900
Anything like that?

15:52.180 --> 15:53.660
Nah, he was off the birds.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.740
I know you and Joey were tight with
each other but don't get any ideas, Eddie.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.780
Like what? Taking the law.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.460
There's only one law that counts,
Fred.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.340
An eye for an eye.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.700
You're a third division shake-down
artist and fourth-rate ponce.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.460
Always were, always will be. Any
comeback over Joey,

16:12.660 --> 16:14.380
I'll have your cobblers for a key
fob.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.340
Mind how you go.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.980
We'll need to find this woman in the
white raincoat.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.860
I'll see where I can get with this
lipstick. Girlfriend, you think?

16:26.060 --> 16:30.260
Witness, potentially. She's the last
person to have seen him alive.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.660
How did you make out with George?
George?

16:32.820 --> 16:33.940
Fancy.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.380
Hm. Trying.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.660
Oh, well, that's good.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.500
I'm looking for a particular shade
of lipstick.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.020
This is the...

16:46.260 --> 16:50.300
I think we can rule out the new
Revlon unlipstick range.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.020
And it's not gonna be the Max Factor
Frosterinos.

16:53.220 --> 16:58.540
Could be Scarlet Billows or Violent
Crimson.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.500
Excuse me. Can I just...?

17:09.380 --> 17:11.060
Hello, stranger.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.660
So, are you back or are you just
visiting?

17:20.619 --> 17:22.260
Dad didn't say?

17:23.300 --> 17:24.660
I'm back!

17:26.180 --> 17:28.940
Couple of weeks now. But not home.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.980
They must be pleased, all the same,
your parents.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.620
I think so.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.300
Mum definitely.
I'm sure they both are.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.300
It's not the same.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.140
No. No, I imagine not.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.100
Mr Booth, my neighbour in Leamington,
said he called you.

17:50.260 --> 17:51.540
Yes.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.180
A fall, the hospital said.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.460
I slipped.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.660
What about you?

18:03.900 --> 18:07.900
Your sergeant's... I meant to ask last time.
Yes, it came through in the end.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.740
Congratulations.

18:11.620 --> 18:14.060
Detective Sergeant Morse.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.300
Things change. Yes.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.220
Yes, I'm this way.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.500
Are you all right?

18:30.820 --> 18:34.140
I mean... really all right?

18:37.820 --> 18:39.180
Something happens.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.980
You have to look a bad thing in the
eye.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.260
Break the spell.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.020
I'll see you around.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.580
It's a small town.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
I know where you buy your lipstick
now.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.700
Tomorrow's world, Thursday.

19:17.860 --> 19:19.380
Sir.

19:20.860 --> 19:25.220
A new divisional HQ for Thames
Valley, Kidlington.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.260
Very smart, sir.

19:27.420 --> 19:30.620
Clean, modern, spacious. Computers.

19:30.820 --> 19:35.260
And an information room that will be
the envy of any constabulary.

19:35.420 --> 19:36.580
And us, sir?

19:36.820 --> 19:41.180
No final decision has yet been reached
on whether Cowley will remain open.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.220
Or if we'll be absorbed into the new
station on Oxford Road.

19:45.420 --> 19:48.620
Wouldn't have thought there'd be room
for us all in there, sir.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.900
No, well, there we are. Ours is not
to reason why.

19:58.420 --> 20:01.900
George seems a nice lad, don't you
think? He's a cocky little sod.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.980
Course he is. He's young.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.340
Full of piss and vinegar. You were
young once.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.660
I'm still young!

20:08.820 --> 20:12.260
Say so. Some shepherd's pie in the
oven I've left you to warm.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.980
Beans in the pan. I'll get the
cribbage board out once Hughie Green's done.

21:11.820 --> 21:14.740
Joan's got a new flat over in
Parktown.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.780
Ever so nice, she says.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.900
Be needing a lick of paint, I should
think, but...

21:20.980 --> 21:23.140
I'm hoping her dad's gonna do it for
her.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.740
But she's happy. That's the main
thing.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.460
Good.

21:28.740 --> 21:31.100
Sir. I'll go and fetch your
sandwiches.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.740
Much in?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.700
Fancy. Morning, sir.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.740
Body's through there.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.740
Doctor.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.700
Aye-aye.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.580
Right first, then left.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.300
Sometime between eight and midnight.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.980
Any defensive wounds?

22:13.140 --> 22:15.300
He didn't see it coming.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.020
Quite literally.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.420
Who was he? His name is Robin Grey.

22:20.620 --> 22:23.340
He's a history don here. I met him
yesterday.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.580
The attempted break-in.

22:24.780 --> 22:27.940
Last seen by the porter going out
around six o'clock last night.

22:28.100 --> 22:29.300
No-one saw him come back.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.820
Lipstick. Same as Joey Sikes.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.380
I know you're out of practice,
but most women wear it.

22:36.580 --> 22:41.580
Uniform are fetching his wife in.
There is evidence of coitus.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.540
Who found him? Spencer Bell, one of
his students.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.220
I went across just before eight
o'clock.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.900
Knocked. There was no reply.

22:51.100 --> 22:54.740
I checked my watch, knocked again,
then went in.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.100
I thought he might have nipped out
for a moment.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.980
In my day, students didn't just
wander into a don's bedroom.

23:00.220 --> 23:04.660
I thought he might have overslept so
I knocked. I don't know why I went in.

23:04.820 --> 23:06.180
I just did.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.300
What was he like?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.220
I saw him for two hours once a week.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.060
I'm afraid I hardly knew him at all.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.580
Where were you last night?

23:20.620 --> 23:23.220
In my room right up there.
Anyone vouch for you?

23:23.460 --> 23:28.420
You'd have had a good view from there.
You didn't see him come back last night?

23:29.820 --> 23:31.780
Mr Bell. I'm not sure it was him.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.100
But I think I recognised her.

23:35.260 --> 23:36.700
Who?

23:38.060 --> 23:39.820
I'm not even sure it was her.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.620
But this woman had on the same coat
she wears - a white raincoat.

23:44.820 --> 23:47.500
But you don't know her name?
No. She's a life model.

23:48.220 --> 23:52.540
I think she knows the tutor Gerard Pickman.
At least that's the idea I got.

23:56.740 --> 24:00.260
I thought all the way over in the car
that there must be some mistake.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.300
What happened?

24:02.460 --> 24:04.700
Was it his heart? An accident?

24:04.940 --> 24:09.180
I'm sorry to have to tell you, Mrs Grey,
but your husband died by violence.

24:09.220 --> 24:12.260
Perhaps you should sit down. Here.

24:12.420 --> 24:14.020
Trewlove.

24:14.740 --> 24:17.460
Here.

24:18.380 --> 24:19.900
OK.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.060
When did you last see your husband?

24:22.220 --> 24:25.060
Er... yesterday morning.

24:26.420 --> 24:29.420
Did Dr Grey often stay in college?

24:29.620 --> 24:33.140
Once or twice a week if he had an
early tutorial.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.900
I'm sorry.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.780
We will need statements from all
staff and undergrads

24:40.940 --> 24:42.340
as to their whereabouts yesterday.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.260
I don't like to ask but what will
happen about the auction?

24:45.460 --> 24:49.020
It can't go ahead now, surely, out
of respect for Robin?

24:49.220 --> 24:52.060
Exactly why it should proceed. He put
so much work into it.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.060
I'll discuss the situation with the
bursar and Mr Lake...

24:55.260 --> 24:58.420
This Mr Lake. He have much to do with
Grey?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.300
Certainly. They were great friends.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.260
He's an art dealer. He's acting for
the estate.

25:04.180 --> 25:06.740
Did their National Service together,
I believe.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.660
We'll need to speak to him if you let
us know where to find him.

25:09.860 --> 25:12.020
Anything to do with the egg, do you
think?

25:12.060 --> 25:14.660
Wasn't it him and the master saw
The Shadow Sunday night?

25:14.820 --> 25:16.300
So they say.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.980
Is there any doubt about that?
They saw someone.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.940
But that it was this cat burglar, I'm
less convinced.

25:22.140 --> 25:25.140
How come? Nobody sees The Shadow,
that's the point.

25:25.340 --> 25:28.620
He comes and goes and no-one's any
the wiser till after he's struck.

25:28.780 --> 25:30.260
So?

25:30.500 --> 25:34.740
So he doesn't go clattering around
the rooftops drawing attention to himself.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.140
They saw somebody up there.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.580
And now Grey's dead.

25:38.780 --> 25:41.620
The undergrad who found his body
says he saw a man and woman

25:41.820 --> 25:44.020
turning onto Grey's stair around
seven o'clock.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.380
Was it Grey? He's not sure.

25:45.580 --> 25:48.740
But he thinks she's a life model
from a private art class he attends.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.460
He's given me an address to the place.
A bit on the side, do you think?

25:52.620 --> 25:54.500
If it was Grey.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.820
See who else lives on his stair,
start taking statements.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.340
All right.

25:59.540 --> 26:02.900
I'll report back to Mr Bright. Pursue
enquiries as you see fit.

26:13.220 --> 26:16.780
I must say, we were all positively
chartreuse at Robin's good luck,

26:16.940 --> 26:18.540
bagging a Matilda beast.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.500
And a rowing blue to boot.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.260
Nothing in the world quite compares
to a sporty girl.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.100
Strong in the wrist and firm in the
hams.

26:25.340 --> 26:29.060
Do you think that talk's appropriate
about a woman widowed not an hour since?

26:29.300 --> 26:32.580
She'd have to have been a very Messalina
to keep Robin down on the farm.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.860
Is that right?
Quite a dog in his day.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.820
Wet his nib in any ink pot.

26:39.060 --> 26:45.660
Take my word. They'll be queuing
halfway up the High to offer their "condolences".

27:28.900 --> 27:29.017
♪♪

27:47.660 --> 27:51.020
The Master called me. It's bloody
awful news. Poor Robin.

27:51.180 --> 27:53.180
You knew him well? Nearly 20 years.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.220
He was a good friend. We did our
National Service together.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.940
Place called Altdorf, right on the
Eastern border.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.500
Can you think of anyone who would
wish him any harm?

28:02.660 --> 28:03.780
Robin? Not a soul.

28:05.060 --> 28:09.660
He was helping to establish a chain of
provenance with this egg of yours, I believe.

28:09.900 --> 28:13.140
Strictly speaking, it's not mine.
I'm acting for the estate of the previous owner.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.940
But, yes. Robin had done a lot of the
legwork. Who is the owner?

28:16.140 --> 28:18.820
Someone who in life valued their
privacy.

28:19.020 --> 28:22.060
The estate wishes to respect that.
I'm sure you understand.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.100
No, I don't understand. Not at all.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.180
First someone tries to steal the
Faberge,

28:27.380 --> 28:30.260
then someone intimately connected
with its sale is murdered.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.940
There's nothing to say the egg is
anything to do with Robin.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.980
I think we'll determine that.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.620
And knowing who the owner is will
help us form an opinion.

28:39.060 --> 28:43.500
I think if my friend had been brutally murdered,
I might be a little more forthcoming.

28:43.660 --> 28:46.540
I'd like to say more, believe me.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.220
Where were you last night?
Out of town.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.580
To say more would risk revealing the
identity of the owner.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.100
Convenient. Not for me.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.900
Did he have a mistress, Dr Grey?

29:00.220 --> 29:02.380
With Lucy at home? Would you?

29:03.620 --> 29:06.340
He never mentioned anyone called
Delilah? No.

29:07.820 --> 29:12.060
I would love to stay and chit-chat but I've got
to collect the egg and get it to Lonsdale.

29:12.100 --> 29:17.060
Since the attempted burglary I'm only allowing it
to be displayed for a couple of hours each day.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.420
The rest of the time, it's in a safe
in my flat.

29:20.060 --> 29:24.620
Of course, I'll be glad to answer anything you
can think of once the auction's out of theway.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.500
Hello.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.420
I'm Detective Sergeant Morse, Thames
Valley CID.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.260
I'm looking for a Gerard Pickman.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.180
One of his students gave me this
address.

29:48.380 --> 29:51.580
He's gone into town. I'm his wife
Cassie.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.940
What time are you expecting him
back?

29:53.980 --> 29:55.740
When his pockets are empty.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.020
You're welcome to wait.

29:58.980 --> 30:00.620
Don't eat that, Alec.

30:03.380 --> 30:05.180
He's an artist, I understand.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.140
That must be interesting work.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.180
Oh, yes.

30:09.420 --> 30:13.700
He's just finished designing the new labels
for Richardson's own-brand vegetables.

30:22.460 --> 30:25.980
Hello, little bastard.
Don't call him that, please!

30:44.420 --> 30:45.660
Sorry to have kept you.

30:45.820 --> 30:47.260
A bigger slash.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.860
Still life? There's a phrase.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.220
It's for the cover of a Kent Finn
paperback - Just For Jolly.

30:54.460 --> 30:58.820
Dreadful hack but if it goes over well, his
publisher's promising the whole back catalogue.

30:59.020 --> 31:01.020
Thus the rent man doth make cowards
of us all.

31:01.180 --> 31:03.060
The .38. Is that a prop?

31:03.260 --> 31:06.580
No, no, it's real enough. I use it
for foxes, other vermin.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.500
No policemen so far.

31:10.780 --> 31:13.260
I don't suppose you know about art.
I know what I like.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.420
It's after Manet, isn't it? Olympia.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.980
The canvas that scandalised the Paris
salon.

31:21.060 --> 31:23.380
Is that the model that sits at your
life class?

31:23.540 --> 31:25.140
That's right.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.500
Does she have a name? Evie.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.060
With the beautiful red hair.

31:31.540 --> 31:33.300
Eve Thorne.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.780
Have you seen her recently?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.300
Yesterday afternoon. I had a class
here.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.580
What about Sunday night?

31:39.620 --> 31:42.980
A car picked her up about midnight.

31:43.140 --> 31:45.020
Taxi, I think. Right.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.180
Have you got an address for her?

31:48.380 --> 31:50.660
Just a telephone number.
It's a messaging service.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.380
She's er... She's not in any
trouble, is she?

31:57.540 --> 32:00.460
It's just a routine enquiry.

32:00.620 --> 32:02.220
She's a good kid.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.180
Are you sleeping with her?

32:04.340 --> 32:05.340
No.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.460
Not for the want of trying.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.900
I don't think she likes men.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.740
Maybe it's just you she doesn't like.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.500
What happened, do you think?

32:31.660 --> 32:33.620
I don't think, Tancred.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.660
And you shouldn't either.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.980
How you finding Oxford,
then, George?

32:47.180 --> 32:50.180
Got your digs sorted?
Section House at the moment.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.220
But I'm looking for a place of my
own.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.820
What about you?

32:54.020 --> 32:57.900
Yeah. Morse is shacked up with me at
the minute.

32:58.140 --> 33:02.380
Hopefully we'll come out of it after a year with
enough saved to put down for a flat each.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.740
Provided we don't kill one another
first.

33:09.580 --> 33:12.780
Well, the cause was as expected.

33:12.980 --> 33:16.380
Sharp object through the orbit of the
right eye and on into the brain.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.940
Death would have been pretty
instantaneous.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.380
What about the weapon?
Ah. Steak knife.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.580
Traditional hump blade with serrated
edge.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.620
Stag-horn handle. Sheffield steel.
Silver-plated.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.100
Engraving dates it to about 1920.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.540
SC. One of the colleges, maybe?
Something college?

33:33.740 --> 33:35.620
Possibly.
Would it have taken much force?

33:35.820 --> 33:38.780
No great strength required. Nerve,
though.

33:38.940 --> 33:40.780
You're thinking of the lipstick.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.140
The closest match I found was
Violent Crimson.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.340
From the Kiss of Death range,
presumably.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.180
How does it compare to what you
found on Joey Sikes?

33:49.340 --> 33:52.060
Not enough of a trace left to say.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.460
A Lonsdale don and a beat-up
ex-boxer.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.140
Hard to see what they had in common.

33:56.340 --> 33:58.940
A woman in a white raincoat,
presumably.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.980
Cherchez la femme.

34:03.820 --> 34:05.780
Parson's Prime.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.860
It's from a brewery outside
Watlington.

34:08.060 --> 34:11.500
According to the foreman, they
supply just one pub in Oxford.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.340
The Cordwangler's Arms. Delilah.
Did you try the number?

34:14.540 --> 34:19.020
Unobtainable. But there's a Delilah
performing there this afternoon.

34:19.219 --> 34:21.060
I've also got a number for Eve
Thorne,

34:21.260 --> 34:23.260
the life model that Spencer Bell was
talking about.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.900
Pickman said she got a taxi from his
place late on Sunday night.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.739
I've left a message on her answer
service to call me back.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.580
Good.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.540
How's the luncheon meat?
Adjourned.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.380
Win says you ran into Joan.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.659
You knew she was back, then?

34:46.900 --> 34:51.940
Yeah. Well, I would have mentioned it
but... what with one thing and another...

34:52.100 --> 34:53.420
Seem all right, did she?

34:53.580 --> 34:55.179
Why, haven't you seen her?

34:55.340 --> 34:57.060
No. No, not yet.

34:57.260 --> 35:00.020
She's been by the house,
but I've been at work.

35:01.780 --> 35:04.140
Sergeant Strange said you'd probably
be here.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.940
How'd it go at Lonsdale this morning?

35:06.100 --> 35:08.220
Um... there's nothing much to report.

35:08.260 --> 35:10.660
Most of them are alibi'd. Except the
Master,

35:10.900 --> 35:14.340
Dr Adrian Croxley and Tancred Howlett.
He lives on the same stair as Dr Grey.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.100
Go on. Go back to the station and
finish writing them up.

35:17.260 --> 35:19.140
I haven't had lunch yet.

35:19.340 --> 35:22.860
I thought I'd just grab a pint, if
it's all the same.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.580
You're not on piecework.
He's time for a beer.

35:25.740 --> 35:28.340
Do you want topping up? No.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.300
Well, just a half, then, George.
Thanks very much.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.540
Certainly never seen it at home.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.100
Is that what it was done with?

35:38.260 --> 35:39.500
Is that how he died?

35:42.380 --> 35:44.340
How long had you been married?

35:45.380 --> 35:48.260
It would have been a year come April
21st.

35:48.460 --> 35:52.060
All was well between you?
Perfectly well.

35:52.260 --> 35:55.020
That's Simon Lake, isn't it?
He was Robin's best man.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.060
They're very old friends.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.740
How did you meet Dr Grey?

35:59.900 --> 36:03.940
At a drinks party... last February.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.980
Two months later we were married.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.780
You had no reason to doubt his
fidelity?

36:10.900 --> 36:14.860
With his body being found the way it
was, well, we're bound to ask.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.500
How was it found?

36:17.580 --> 36:19.580
There was lipstick around his mouth.

36:20.460 --> 36:25.860
And signs that physical intimacy had
taken place shortly before his death.

36:26.060 --> 36:30.940
I always knew Robin had lived...
a full life.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.220
But from the moment we were married,

36:33.460 --> 36:37.940
he never once gave me any cause to think
of him as anything other than devoted.

36:38.140 --> 36:42.060
She wouldn't be the first wife to not
know her husband was deceiving her.

36:42.260 --> 36:45.460
Unless she did, of course. Just keep
your wits about you.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.500
What does that mean?

36:47.700 --> 36:51.540
Good-looking girl? Tears? Not every
damsel in distress wants saving.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.580
What she looks like's nothing to do
with it.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.660
I wonder if she knew Joey Sikes.

36:55.860 --> 36:59.380
Sikes is gangland. He's no
connection with Dr Grey.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.820
They were both killed by particularly
gruesome means.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.180
Both last seen with a woman wearing
a white raincoat

37:04.380 --> 37:06.420
and both had been kissed by someone
in red lipstick.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.380
That's more than a coincidence.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.220
And a Bathsheba but she got glassed.

gown, would you?

38:25.900 --> 38:28.020
So...

What do you want, then? Do you know
a Robin Grey?

38:30.980 --> 38:34.340
No. Who is he? He's a don at
Lonsdale College.

38:34.540 --> 38:36.820
Found this beer mat with your name on
it.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.820
Any idea how he'd come by that? No.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.500
That is your phone number on the
back?

38:42.700 --> 38:44.660
No. I don't know whose that is.

38:45.700 --> 38:49.940
I can't be the only Delilah on the circuit.
The faces change, the names stay the same.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.740
Has he had an accident? He was found
dead this morning.

38:54.820 --> 38:59.500
Do they ever ask for your telephone
number, the... customers?

39:01.820 --> 39:04.340
They can ask, but ask don't get.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.140
I've got two kids. That's who I do
this for.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.780

I'm surprised he's still going.
You know him?

Oh, yeah. I know Lefty.

All right, Left?

39:31.220 --> 39:33.380
Fred! I'm just going to lunch.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.420
Late lunch.

39:35.580 --> 39:38.100
Spare five minutes? Always.

39:38.260 --> 39:40.140
Got your book?

39:44.780 --> 39:46.740
I just came to offer my condolences.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.300
If there's anything I can do...
Thank you.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.420
That's very kind. Do the police have
any further idea?

39:52.620 --> 39:56.020
They suggested he may have been with
another woman last night.

39:57.300 --> 39:59.780
You lived across the stair. You
didn't see?

39:59.940 --> 40:01.620
I was out.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.140
I'm sure they're mistaken.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.180
Was I a fool, Tancred? Never.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.780
Fooled, then.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.500
There's only one fool here.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.180
And it was never you.

Delilah. Paula?

40:20.020 --> 40:21.900
Lovely little mover.

Just come off a very successful
"Dick" at Eastbourne.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.300
Is that right?

40:26.500 --> 40:29.140
I'm hoping to get her a summer season
with Engelbert at Blackpool.

40:29.340 --> 40:32.460
What about the stripping?
Exotic dancing.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.340
It's all very tasteful. Nothing
smutty. I've seen it.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.220
Doesn't leave much to the
imagination.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.340
That rather depends on your
imagination, doesn't it?

40:43.460 --> 40:45.860
Why all the Biblical names?
Adds mystery.

40:46.100 --> 40:49.780
The girls are hardly likely to use their own,
are they? And the punters like it.

Oh, no. I've had quite a few over the

45:02.440 --> 45:04.720
Anything, Doc? Well...

45:04.920 --> 45:07.160
his head's in this room and his
body's in that room.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.080
So that might have something to do
with it.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.680
Anything as to a time, say?

45:12.840 --> 45:14.720

Saw this woman in the white mac coming out
at around... half four, quarter to five.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.400
Well, he wasn't shot.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.640
Three men slaughtered with such
violence.

46:04.840 --> 46:08.160
You're surely not suggesting a woman
could have done it?

46:08.360 --> 46:11.560
Two of the victims were found in bed,
sir. And with lipstick.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.440
So Joey Sikes was shot, then a skewer
was driven into his ear.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.720
Dr Grey was stabbed in both eyes and
now Lake has been decapitated.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.360
That means something, doesn't it?

46:20.520 --> 46:21.880
The method, do you think?

46:23.280 --> 46:27.520
Oh, SC. Same as was found on the
knife that killed Dr Grey.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.240
And the egg?

46:30.440 --> 46:34.160
There was a single red rose been
left, sir. The Shadow's signature.

46:39.720 --> 46:43.080
How come door-to-door never picked
up Lake was living here?

46:43.240 --> 46:45.120
Not his property, sir.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.240
Looks like he was only staying for
the duration of the auction.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.240
Owner's listed as one Bertram Povey.
Deceased.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.680
Knew each other, didn't
they, Lake and Dr Grey?

46:55.840 --> 46:58.080
Both connected to this egg.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.120
That's the key, isn't it?

47:02.280 --> 47:07.040
What have you got there?
A menu. 1st April last year.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.680
"On the occasion of the passing of
the Mock Turtle."

47:14.320 --> 47:17.760
You were seen leaving Simon Lake's
flat earlier this afternoon.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.640
We can put you in a line-up, have
our witness pick you out.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.800
He'd asked me round for four.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.200
I got held up. In the end I didn't
make it till quarter past, maybe.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.440
The door was open so I went in.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.560
I went into the bedroom.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.320
Next thing I remember, I was on the
bus.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.480
And on Sunday night, when the taxi
dropped you off at the party,

47:47.680 --> 47:49.280
that's who you were seeing... Simon
Lake.

47:50.280 --> 47:53.200
And on Monday morning, you were
inside the flat with Lake

47:53.360 --> 47:54.840
when the driver's body was found.

47:55.040 --> 48:00.240
Yeah. We heard you knocking but Simon
didn't want to answer the door.

48:00.440 --> 48:03.760
Mr Bright would like a word, sir.
In a minute.

48:09.480 --> 48:12.080
Did you notice whether the safe was
open or closed?

48:12.240 --> 48:13.880
No. I don't remember.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.280
And the driver of the taxi, Joey
Sikes.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.720
Do you know him? No.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.640
I advise you to cooperate, Miss
Thorne, in your own best interests.

48:25.680 --> 48:30.920
So... you sleep with Lake on Sunday,
Grey on Monday.

48:31.120 --> 48:33.480
Then come back for another round
with Lake today.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.960
And...?
Your fingerprints have turned up

48:36.120 --> 48:38.440
your previous convictions.

48:38.640 --> 48:41.280
Soliciting. You're a common
prostitute.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.440
You've seen where I live.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.440
There's nothing common about me.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.520
What's your type?

48:50.560 --> 48:52.520
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

48:52.760 --> 48:57.320
Do you go for the mousy sort? Butter wouldn't melt
but get their glasses off and, "Oh, Daddy."

48:57.520 --> 49:00.240
That's quite enough.
Maybe you want a goddess.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.920
Someone you can put on a pedestal.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.280
Unobtainable. Or perhaps you like to
be mothered.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.760
Have someone wash your tinkle.
Take her back to her cell.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.320
You haven't taken your eyes off me.

49:10.480 --> 49:14.040
I've got your number. I know where
you are. You like to watch, right?

49:14.240 --> 49:16.000
Look but don't touch. I know your
kind.

49:16.200 --> 49:19.520
What's that book? The Spy In The
House Of Love, that's you.

49:20.600 --> 49:23.680
Outside looking in at what you want
but daren't ask for.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.280
Take her down.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.960
- You think she killed him?
- She knew all three victims.

49:31.160 --> 49:34.200
Had slept with two of them, both are
connected to this Faberge egg.

49:34.440 --> 49:37.736
For all we know, Lake was still alive when she
arrived. Now he's dead and the egg's gone.

49:37.760 --> 49:42.000
I've known clients get possessive to
the point of obsession in some cases.

49:42.240 --> 49:46.200
The only reason I can think of for her to
lie is if she saw someone she recognised

49:46.440 --> 49:49.760
by Lake's flat, going in or coming out,
someone she was afraid of, maybe.

49:49.960 --> 49:52.880
If she saw him, it's very likely he
saw her.

49:53.120 --> 49:57.360
Which offers the possibility that
whoever it is will try and get to her.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.720
Morse? Reservations?

50:01.800 --> 50:04.240
I think the only thing she's scared
of, sir, is us.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.720
You reckon it's her?

50:05.920 --> 50:08.360
She's lying through her teeth.
There's two options.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.720
She did it or she knows who did.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.080
Either way, I want her under
observation.

50:17.280 --> 50:17.396
♪♪

50:51.852 --> 50:53.289
Stockings are in the shoes.

50:53.314 --> 50:57.354
You'll find the soles are blood-stained.
You've been there. You know what it was like.

51:00.004 --> 51:02.844
This is all you were wearing when
you went to Lake's?

51:02.965 --> 51:04.605
That's all.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.080
Was he a regular customer?

51:07.115 --> 51:09.315
When he was in town.
How often was that?

51:09.680 --> 51:12.720
Till this last week I hadn't seen him
for a year, maybe.

51:13.493 --> 51:16.055
Does he know what you do? Pickman?

51:16.080 --> 51:18.200
He knows what he needs to. Why?

51:18.240 --> 51:21.640
Olympia. The painting he's working
on, the Manet knock-off.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.920
Olympia was a common name used by
Parisian prostitutes.

51:25.080 --> 51:26.760
Except she wasn't a tart, was she?

51:27.000 --> 51:31.560
The model. Her name was Victorine Meurent.
She was an artist in her own right.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.040
Her work was selected for exhibition,
Manet's wasn't.

51:35.360 --> 51:39.360
Pickman tell you that?
I read it. In a book.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.200
Do you think he's any good?

51:41.360 --> 51:43.000
Not particularly.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.720
He can't shake off the draughtsman's
training.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.280
That's what they put him to in the
Army.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.760
He doesn't seem the Army kind.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.240
National Service, wasn't it?

51:53.400 --> 51:54.920
I think that's how he knew Simon.

51:56.760 --> 51:58.080
Simon Lake?

51:58.280 --> 52:00.240
I saw him out at the windmill last
week.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.040
That's when we picked up again.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.800
What was his business with Pickman?

52:03.960 --> 52:05.640
No idea.

52:06.480 --> 52:08.160
First thing you learn in my game...

52:09.720 --> 52:11.240
..you don't open your mouth.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.320
Unless they ask you to.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.520
Right.

52:37.520 --> 52:40.160
Is this your idea of discreet
observation?

52:42.360 --> 52:45.240
It's an unmarked car, not a concert
hall.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.640
Yeah. All right.

52:47.840 --> 52:51.480
Just keep your mind on the job and
make sure she doesn't try to leave.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.320
Is she likely to?

52:53.560 --> 52:56.840
When you're relieved, get these
booked into Forensics at the station.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.280
Did you get the contents of Joey
Sikes's suitcase booked in?

53:00.440 --> 53:01.800
Ohh.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.960
Is this what I've got to look
forward to?

53:08.160 --> 53:11.600
If I want something doing, I've got
to do it myself?

53:11.760 --> 53:13.640
I forgot. Well, don't.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.400
You're not paid to forget. You're
paid to remember.

53:36.040 --> 53:39.000
Was it Miss Thorne? That's right.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.760
Call received today from a Mr Lake
at 13.54.

53:42.960 --> 53:46.640
"If Miss Thorne would care to call
round to Holywell Lane at 16:00."

53:46.840 --> 53:49.280
Can you confirm when that was picked
up, and if so by whom?

53:49.440 --> 53:50.880
Miss Astor?

53:51.640 --> 53:55.960
This call from Mr Lake for Miss Thorne.
Has Miss Thorne picked it up yet?

53:56.120 --> 53:57.440
I believe so.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.280
I'll need the address for that
account.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.640
I'm afraid the manager's gone home
for the evening.

54:01.840 --> 54:03.800
He's the only one with access to
that information.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.880
But from memory it's a temporary
agency, I think.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.920
Thank you, Miss Astor.

54:11.280 --> 54:13.240
Temporary agency?

54:13.400 --> 54:15.520
Yeah. I can imagine what sort.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.160
Home?

54:21.880 --> 54:25.280
I'll walk, if it's all the same,
get a bit of clean air in my lungs.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.840
I had three years on Vice, never
agreed with me.

54:33.080 --> 54:37.520
Bodies bought and sold, lives ruined.
Not much more than kids, half of them - runaways.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.800
You could see the sharks, the pimps
and the ponces,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.760
queued up waiting for them at all
the big stations.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.520
"Stand you a coffee, love?"

54:45.720 --> 54:47.880
Straight off the train, straight on
the game.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.160
The worst of human nature
right there.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.000
It's no work for a family man.

54:59.480 --> 55:01.120
One for the road?

55:01.280 --> 55:02.480
Yes.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.480
Oh, er... no, I can't.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.800
I want to get Joey Sikes's personal
possessions logged into Evidence.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.840
Haven't you done that yet?

55:13.080 --> 55:16.360
No, it slipped my mind. That's not
the example you wanna set Fancy.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.880
You're a sergeant now. You gotta
look sharp.

55:19.040 --> 55:20.760
Yeah.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.720
Night, then.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.240
Good night, sir.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.120
Dad?

55:36.480 --> 55:38.160
Fred?

55:47.640 --> 55:49.600
You've been back ages.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.920
Fred?

56:00.280 --> 56:02.240
Joan's all right, in't she?

56:03.440 --> 56:04.640
Happy?

56:05.800 --> 56:07.280
She says.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.000
I spoke to her earlier.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.680
She rang.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.960
I don't know what it is with you
pair.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.160
She got back.

56:19.200 --> 56:21.040
You've barely spoken to her since
she got back.

56:22.840 --> 56:25.360
I know you were cross with her
going off.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.760
I'd do anything for her.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.800
I know you would.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.840
If anything ever happened...

56:35.000 --> 56:36.880
if she was in a spot...

56:38.240 --> 56:39.520
..you'd say?

56:42.560 --> 56:43.840
Come to bed.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.480
La Traviata Act I

58:19.320 --> 58:21.440
So Lake was The Shadow?

58:21.640 --> 58:24.640
Looks that way. Just off him having
a balaclava?

58:24.840 --> 58:28.600
Roses are sold by the dozen,
traditionally. Yes. Why?

58:28.840 --> 58:32.200
Ten in the vase, one in the safe...
And the 12th on the roof of Lonsdale.

58:32.400 --> 58:35.280
He was trying to pinch his own
jewel?

58:36.520 --> 58:39.040
Or get it in the papers and drive the
price up.

58:39.240 --> 58:42.600
He knew Pickman, or had business
with him, according to Eve Thorne.

58:42.800 --> 58:46.280
There's a student might be able to
shed some light. I'll talk to him.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.920
Word through on Lake's flat, sir.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.560
Gas and electric go through to
a Tancred Howlett.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.600
That's one of the dons at
Lonsdale. I had a statement off him.

58:55.760 --> 58:57.640
He lives on the same stair as Grey.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.280
Where have you been?

59:23.440 --> 59:25.320
With her, I suppose.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.240
An hour, you said.

59:30.120 --> 59:32.800
That was two o'clock yesterday
afternoon.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.160
Is this the woman you saw in the
quad with Grey?

59:36.400 --> 59:40.400
I don't know. She was wearing a headscarf.
It was the white coat I recognised.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.760
But that is Pickman's model?
Yeah. It's her.

59:42.800 --> 59:45.760
And it's life studies she sits for?

59:45.920 --> 59:47.560
Mostly.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.040
Pickman's had us do her as
Botticelli's Venus.

59:50.240 --> 59:54.040
The girl from Dejeuner Sur L'Herbe,
and any number of Gentileschi copies:

59:54.240 --> 59:57.480
Giuditta Con La Sua Ancella, Susanna
E Vecchioni.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.280
Do you ever see her outside of
class?

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.840
No.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.880
But you want to.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.120
She's a model. If she smiles at you
in class, she's being paid for it.
It's art.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.840
Not real life.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.360
Some of us can tell the difference.
Can Pickman?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.160
Is he a good tutor?
Best I can afford.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.920
How was it you know Simon Lake,
Dr Howlett?

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.960
We were up together...

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.560
..at St Alfredus.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.160
But he got sent down.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.040
For what? Conduct unbecoming.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.760
Fleecing tourists at Find the Lady.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.200
Seems a bit stiff.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.760
He also got one of the cleaners
in trouble.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.760
He said it wasn't his but someone had
to carry the can.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.760
We stayed in touch and...

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.840
as he was in town...

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.640
But you don't live there yourself?

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.600
No, no. Er... I inherited the place
a couple of years ago from an uncle.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.440
I wonder if you could shed any light
on this.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.320
It's er... It looks like a menu.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.720
I know what it looks like. I want to
know what it means.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.360
Who's the Mock Turtle?

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.720
I wouldn't know.
Are you sure about that?

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.400
It was found in the pocket of a tailcoat hanging
in the wardrobe in your flat on HolywellLane.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.960
My colleague found an identical
waistcoat in Dr Grey's room.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.920
He said it looks like the order of
service for a dining club.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.840
It was Robin's stag.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.400
Robin was the Mock Turtle, hence...

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.800
The passing of the Mock Turtle, so...
What's this club?

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.040
The Berserkers.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.080
Why so cagey? Why deny it?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.160
I don't want to get involved in this.
Two people known to me have been murdered.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.800
We know that.
Where was it held, the stag?

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.160
I don't know where.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.200
I wasn't there. Adrian was there but
I was ill. I didn't go.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.760
You've got the menu!

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.440
Robin saved one for me.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.320
A souvenir.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.560
What was your business with Simon
Lake?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.480
Just that. Business.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.440
He liked my work. I sold him the odd
piece.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.320
You were in the Army together,
weren't you?

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.880
Altdorf. What is this?

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.000
We've got a Faberge gone missing

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.360
and two men connected with its sale
found dead.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.280
Two men that you did National
Service with.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.080
That's more than a coincidence.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.920
I wouldn't know about that.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.520
"He liked my work.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.320
I sold him a few pieces."

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.760
Past tense. You knew he was dead
before I told you.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.080
Now, look... A neighbour on Holywell
Lane heard a shot.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.880
But I actually think it was your bike backfiring.
I heard it the first time I came here.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.080
You were at Simon Lake's flat yesterday.
Did you kill him and take the egg?

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.120
Or was he dead when you arrived? I
didn't kill Simon or steal the egg!

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.040
I've seen the Cyrillic writing in
your barn.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.480
Tell them, Gerry.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.800
Cass! You tell them or I will.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.720
Cass! She doesn't know what she's
talking about.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.760
It was a con.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.200
That's the kind of artist my husband
is.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.560
You think I didn't know you were up
to something?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.920
Think I didn't notice?

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.640
Your old Army mates just dropping by
out the blue?

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.120
Cass, please! I'm looking out for
the kids, Gerry.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.520
He's an idiot. Easily led.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.360
But he's not a killer.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.000
If someone killed Robin and Simon
over the egg...

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.120
I don't want them coming for him
next.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.160
So Lake never meant to go through
with the sale?

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.040
No, sir. It was intended as an
insurance fraud all along.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.960
Lake planned to give the egg to Pickman
that afternoon and say it had been stolen.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.800
When Pickman arrived to collect the
egg, it had already gone.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.880
And he found Simon Lake murdered.
Three of them were involved in the fraud.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.680
Lake paid Pickman to draft a design,
supposedly by Faberge,

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.800
in order to create false provenance.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.960
Grey, the authority on Russian
Imperial jewellery, signed off on it.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.040
- How did they come by it in the first
place? - Pickman explained.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.640
They were soldiers at a camp for
displaced persons on the East German border.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.280
They transported some refugees to the
West in exchange for the egg.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.280
But without the provenance it's
worthless.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.840
They bided their time until they
could do something with it.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.320
So where does that leave us? Could
Pickman have killed Lake and the rest,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.560
taken the egg for himself?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.840
If that had been his intention, why leave the
papers supporting its provenance behind?

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.240
The materials used in its making notwithstanding,
without them it's worthless.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.560
If he's not got it, who has?

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.880
The killer presumably, sir.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.240
We have got a further lead.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.520
Very well. Carry on.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.320
So, you are a Berserker, Dr Croxley?

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.840
Just a bunch of like-minded fellows,
making merry.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.520
We've got two of your number dead.
Not much to be merry about.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.560
All dons, is it?

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.520
In the main, though not exclusively.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.440
The sole proviso of membership is one
must be a gentleman of quality.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.680
You were at Dr Grey's stag party
last year.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.920
Alas, a young man married.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.040
I take it from that you're a single
man yourself.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.240
Absolutely.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.840
"What passing bells...?" They don't
call it a morning suit for nothing.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.880
Why didn't Tancred Howlett attend?

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.240
It's no great secret, not around
college.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.320
He'd entertained hopes of Lucy
himself.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.360
Was Robin Grey aware of that?

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.400
Oh, yes.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.480
So... Dr Grey was there, Simon Lake.
Who else?

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.760
It's a secret society.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.040
As an officer of rank, I'm sure
that's something you can respect.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.080
Middle-aged academics, prancing
around in waistcoats,

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.840
calling each other daft names? I've
more time for the Tufty Club.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.080
I beg your pardon?
You can beg my fat arse!

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.240
Grow up, Dr Croxley. You're too old
for the dressing-up box.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.760
There are no secrets as far as the
law's concerned.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.440
Well. Since you put it like that...

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.440
..I can give you a list of those
I remember.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.320
Was Joey Sikes there?

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.000
Doesn't ring a bell, I'm afraid. Who
is he?

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.480
Where was the party held?

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.920
I don't recall.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.360
Wouldn't be the Shiplake Chase
Hotel, by any chance?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.240
Really? Was that it?

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.320
Shiplake Chase? Pulled that one out
the bag, didn't you?

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.760
There was a bundle of bar bills in
Joey Sikes' suitcase. SC.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.720
Same as engraved on the knife that killed Grey.
And the silverware at Lake's.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.114
Go ahead, caller.

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:58.450
Good afternoon. I'd like to leave
a message for Miss Thorne.

01:07:00.714 --> 01:07:00.817
♪♪

01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:18.675
They said they were a rugby club
up from Cambridge.

01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:22.515
I've been in the pub and hotel trade
for 30 years.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.580
And I've never seen anything like it.
Played up, did they?

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.940
They looked very respectable in their
evening suits and waistcoats.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.340
But once the wine was in... they went
berserk.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.500
Everything smashed to pieces.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.700
What they did to the pig's head
centrepiece...

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.820
I told them, "If I'd known you would
carry on like that, I'd have put straw down."

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.220
In the end, I threatened them with the police.
They asked to see the owner.

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.820
Gave him a cheque, did they?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.780
I couldn't say, sir.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.820
I refused to serve them.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.540
And threatened to give notice if the
owner insisted.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.620
The rest of the staff did the same.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.940
We closed the bar at 10.30 and left
them to it.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.860
Have you had any thefts lately?

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:06.500
We had some agency staff in for a
wedding about a month ago. Things went missing.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.100
We did ask them to look into it,
but haven't heard back.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.220
So two of the victims were members
of this disgusting dining club?

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.260
The... What is it?

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.620
The Berserkers, sir.
The Berserkers.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.500
Sounds like a collection of
Philistines.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.859
Joey Sikes wasn't a member,
sir.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:31.779
The Philistines... put Samson's eyes
out after he was betrayed by Delilah.

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:34.180
The name on Grey's beer mat.
He was stabbed in the eyes.

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.140
And the rest?

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:38.540
I don't know.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:43.060
That still leaves Eve Thorne as being
the only link between all three of them.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.779
Anything from her answering service?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.500
They're still compiling a list of messages.
Her bills go to 24 Tobacco Yard.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:52.060
Tobacco Yard? That's the address of
Magdalen Cabs.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.460
Call girls. That's what Joey Sikes
was running for you.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.700
That's what he was doing in Holywell
Lane the night he got the hard word.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.060
I don't know what you're talking
about.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.020
I'll spell it out for you. The
client gets the girl's name and
number from a contactbook.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.380
Same kind of contact book I found in
Joey Sikes' flat.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:14.140
He calls and leaves a message for
Eve or Jezebel

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.460
or whichever belle de jour takes his
fancy with an answering service.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.020
The girls ring in as often as needs
be to pick up their messages.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.580
But if it's particularly urgent and can't wait,
the messages relay to Magdalen Cabs.

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:29.740
But you know that because you're
paying the bills.

01:09:29.939 --> 01:09:33.020
Anything you'd like to say?
Can't help you.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.779
Let's see if a night in the cells
can't jog your memory.

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.340
On what charge?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.779
Procurement, conspiracy to corrupt
public morals. Take your pick.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:42.460
Either way, you're nicked.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.220
Afternoon, sir. How may I be of
service?

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.620
A few things my wife asked me to pick
up.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.060
I've er... got a list here, if that's
a help.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.820
Your mum said you were back.

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.820
All right, are you?

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.660
I'm fine.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.700
New flat?

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.460
That's right.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.900
Just me and two girlfriends. No men,
if that's what you're wondering.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.940
I just wanted to see how you were.
Checking up on me? No.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.460
I can let you have my flatmates'
names if you want to run them past Records.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.380
I just want things to be right.

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.740
Right?

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.340
How they were. We always got on.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.860
You can't fix it.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.380
I've seen what happens when you try
to fix things.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:04.180
There are bad things in the world,
Joanie, bad people, wickedness.

I've only tried to keep you safe
from that. Nobody asked you to.

You, your mum and Sam. If I've come
up short...

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.300
It's 1968.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.020

Residents in and out. Florist dropped
off some flowers. That's about it.

She hasn't been in or out?
Not since I've been here.

Fancy said the same.

I think she's a dangerous woman.

the wedding at Shiplake Chase.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.080
So it seems.

01:13:36.171 --> 01:13:39.251
Flowers, chocolates... You should see
the lingerie they send.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.120
"Eve Thorne, RA."

01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:50.053
Well... the Royal Academy would be
thrilled.

01:13:50.155 --> 01:13:52.355
Judgmental prick, aren't you?

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.240
Who did you see when you left
Holywell Lane?

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.280
Nobody. I've told you.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.040
I don't remember anything from
finding Simon...

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.680
To being on the bus. Yes, you said.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.520
You know, if you're in any trouble,
I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.560
I don't need your help.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.440
I've been taking care of myself
since I was old enough to know how.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.640
Looks that way.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.480
You gonna ride in on your white
charger and save me? Is that it?

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.400
There aren't any heroes. Just men
and I know what they're like.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.520
I'm sure you do. Oh, you bet.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.840
I knew a girl once.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.880
Convent educated.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.640
Wanted to be an artist.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.560
Did a bit of modelling, dancing,
just to make ends.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.600
Got in with the wrong crowd.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.880
One night, at some party somewhere,

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.360
they went at her like dogs.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.800
I'm sorry.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.840
I'm sure you are.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.520
You're always sorry after.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.520
I don't need you.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.400
I don't need anyone.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.960
So are you any closer to finding out
who did it?

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.600
Is that why you invited me in?

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.760
Maybe.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.040
You got a girl?

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.320
Didn't think so.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.120
When did you last get your leg over?

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.160
As a matter of interest.
None of your business.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.480
It's exactly my business.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.240
I just don't see why you get to ask
all the questions, that's all.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.440
You know everything about me.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.480
I know nothing about you.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.920
Save it for your clients, Miss
Thorne.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.360
I'm immune.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.280
You've got needs coming off you like
a junkie gouging for a spike.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.400
But you won't do anything about it.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.440
Why? What happened?

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.720
Somebody take your girl?

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.560
I can help you forget her.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.200
Or maybe you don't want to.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.400
I can be her, if you like.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.240
Are you expecting somebody?

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.040
Bed time.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.320
Are you gonna change your mind?

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.600
Why "weibermacht"? What?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.840
The inscription. "Weibermacht... the
power of women."

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.160
The hand that rocks the cradle,
right?

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.080
It's an artistic theme.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.800
Powerful men brought down by women.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.840
Is that what this is about?

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.440
Is that why they've been killed in
such a specific manner?

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.480
How would I know?

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.520
Unless I killed them.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.160
They don't touch me, if that's what
worries you.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.120
They might think they do. They get
her for an hour or two.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.680
They get exactly what they paid for.
They don't get me.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.040
Is that what you tell yourself?
Listen, tiger.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.720
We all do what we have to, even you.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.400
What I do is honest.
You think so?

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.720
How many times have you fitted
someone up, planted evidence,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.240
knocked a confession out of some
poor bastard? Never!

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.760
You will. No.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.920
That's what coppers do. I know.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.240
I've seen it, I've lived it,
so don't tell me.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.040
You might think you're above it all but
you're down in the dirt with the rest of us.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.880
Go to bed! Bastard!

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.880
Why don't you make me?

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.160
You're not Miss Evie.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.960
Eve Thorne was at Shiplake Chase, the
entertainment for Robin Grey's stag night.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.520
She wasn't alone. Ruth Astor, the telephonist,
her name came up on a list of agency staff

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.600
sent to Shiplake Chase. We should
go. Where? Adrian Croxley's.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.040
I was looking forward to a nice
dolly party.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.120
All girls together.
Evie couldn't come.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.800
I suppose you'll do.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.520
Eve Thorne, RA. I thought the RA
stood for Royal Academy.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.920
Only, it was Ruth Astor.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.360
They must've both been hired to be the
entertainment for Robin Grey's stag.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.520
And Joey Sikes was the
driver.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.240
Here.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.960
Put some of this on her. She looks
like death warmed up.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.600
Smile.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.240
I can't. Yes, you can.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.080
And you be nice.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.960
You don't remember me, do you?

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:01.760
Something terrible happened at
Shiplake Chase that night.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.880
I don't think I've had the pleasure.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.000
You have.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.360
Very good. We have some
entertainment for you.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.880
Very pretty. Fantastic wine, this.
Cheers.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.800
What are you doing?
I tried to forget about you.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.520
Believe me, I tried.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.320
Eddie gave her a job at the telephone
message service by way of a pay-off.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.240
He was the one who sent her there
after all.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.480
Make it right, Eddie. You get her
fixed up. You make her right.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.720
Which would leave her perfectly placed
to hunt them all down one by one.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.160
Good afternoon. It's Dr Grey here.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.920
It was Grey's voice
I recognised first.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.120
Then yours.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.560
But Lake's was the hardest to find.

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.360
I had to... I had to wait.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.880
But I had time.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.240
I'd like to leave a message, please.

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.960
So she goes back to Shiplake Chase,
posing as an agency temp.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.200
And steals the silverware she used to
kill Grey and Lake.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.000
I wanted you to know who was coming.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.960
Why drive a skewer into
Joey's ear when she's already shot him?

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.600
Many of these scenes of vengeful
women were painted by Artemisia Gentileschi.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:37.440
She also suffered at the hands of
men, just like Ruth Astor.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.120
Jael, who slew Sisera by driving
a tent peg into his temple.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.600
Samson, undone by Delilah, before being
delivered into the hands of the Philistines

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.640
to be blinded.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.360
Which makes Lake what?

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.240
Holofernes, perhaps?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.160
Being beheaded by Judith.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.520
I wanted you to know what it felt
like...

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:11.280
..to feel powerless and afraid.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.040
So what's she got in store for
Adrian Croxley?

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.920
You're frightened now, right?

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.360
Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is
with thee

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.000
Blessed art thou among women

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.960
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.560
Leave her go! MAN: Ooh!

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.560
You'll pay for this, you bastards.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.280
It was you.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.160
I thought it had to be.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.000
Ruth.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.480
Ruthie.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.040
Darling, you've got to get away from here.
The police are coming, sweetheart.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.080
Let go of the knife, eh?

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.840
Ruth! Oh, Ruthie, what have you done
to yourself?

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.800
I got them.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.960
I know, baby.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.400
I know.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.440
All of them.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.640
I tried... It was too much.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.240
Get away. You don't touch her.
Nobody's gonna touch her!

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.520
She needs an ambulance.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.560
No. No.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.080
No, she doesn't want an ambulance.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.600
She'll die! Nobody touches her!

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.160
Ruth? Come on. Come on.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.640
Ruth... Ruthie?

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.320
Ruthie.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.640
Can we charge her with
anything?

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.680
If she knew this girl was the killer?

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.640
I don't think she was certain, sir.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.400
Not until the end.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.840
It would be the devil to prove
otherwise.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.280
Who was she, this girl?
Ruth Astor, sir.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.320
No family as far as we can make out.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.120
Eve Thorne seems to have been the
only person to show her any kindness.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.680
She helped her out.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.400
Helped her get back on her feet
after... Shiplake Chase.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.680
She did all that?

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.360
They all wanted something they
couldn't have, I suppose.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.160
Doesn't everyone?

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.760
Police are looking for a young
white man, well dressed, medium build,

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.640
driving a white Mustang, who shot and possibly
critically wounded Dr Martin Luther King, Jr

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.360
at his hotel room in Memphis,
Tennessee, this evening.
