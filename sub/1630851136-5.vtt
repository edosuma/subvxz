him down because he's dealing,</i>

Grace's son?</i>

<i>energetic music</i>

15:16.081 --> 15:19.084

15:40.981 --> 15:42.900
I'm a representative

15:42.942 --> 15:46.278
<i>You're about to be handed
union authorization cards</i>

15:46.737 --> 15:48.364
<i>from 51% of your employees.</i>

15:48.781 --> 15:49.448
<i>Gracie, who is this?</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:50.866
<i>She just told you who she is.</i>

15:51.492 --> 15:52.868
<i>Don't try to give those to me.
I'm not taking them.</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:54.828
<i>Whether you take them
or not, they indicate that</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:58.248
<i>51% of your employees would like
to be represented by a union.</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:00.417
<i>Fifty-one percent?</i>

16:00.793 --> 16:01.585
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:02.836
<i>It's what the cards say.</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:04.713
At this point,

16:04.713 --> 16:07.591
<i>you can either voluntarily
recognize the union</i>

16:07.591 --> 16:09.677
<i>as a bargaining representative
for its employees...</i>

16:10.135 --> 16:12.388
<i>Voluntarily? What?</i>

16:12.846 --> 16:13.806
<i>Bethany, what's going on here?</i>

16:13.847 --> 16:15.766
<i>You used to come to me if you
needed something. What happened?</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:17.726
<i>Or you can refuse to recognize
the card check majority,</i>

16:17.726 --> 16:20.729
<i>which will result in
a secret-ballot election</i>

16:21.355 --> 16:24.024

<i>Do you think these women can
afford union fees?</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:37.746
<i>These families are
barely getting by.</i>

16:37.746 --> 16:40.290
<i>They can't even keep
the heat on in winter.</i>

16:40.666 --> 16:42.334
<i>And whose fault is that?</i>

16:45.170 --> 16:46.630
<i>You are gonna be the reason</i>

16:46.672 --> 16:48.590
<i>that all these women lose
their jobs.</i>

16:48.632 --> 16:49.925
<i>-You understand that?
- And you are responsible</i>

16:49.967 --> 16:52.594
<i>for these women not having
any health insurance,</i>

16:53.137 --> 16:54.096
<i>and no benefits,
and no paid leave.</i>

16:55.014 --> 16:57.391
<i>I hope you feel good
about what you're about to do.</i>

16:57.850 --> 16:58.434
<i>There's a system in place.</i>

16:59.018 --> 16:59.727
<i>Companies do this all the time.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:02.396
<i>I am not like other companies.</i>

17:02.855 --> 17:04.690
<i>It's only me here. Just me.</i>

17:05.482 --> 17:09.278
<i>You listed two options,</i>

17:09.570 --> 17:11.780
<i>move or shut down.</i>

it's not hot.</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:35.637
<i>Took it from an old
construction site I was at.</i>

17:35.679 --> 17:37.765
<i>-It's good shit.
- All right, bud, that's good.</i>

17:38.265 --> 17:40.392
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

17:45.230 --> 17:46.815
<i>All right. He bit, man.</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:50.235
<i>Come on, help me get the shit
out of the back.</i>

You're like clockwork.</i>

<i>Normally keeps me calm,
but you just ruined it.</i>

18:21.558 --> 18:23.477
<i>I only have a couple
of questions for you.</i>

18:24.812 --> 18:26.230
<i>See? You ruined it.</i>

18:27.147 --> 18:29.566
<i>What are the charges Sue's
gonna bring against Billy Poe?</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:30.776
<i>I'm not playing this game.</i>

18:31.318 --> 18:32.653
<i>I need to bring Billy in
by tonight.</i>

18:33.153 --> 18:33.946
<i>I just want a little heads-up,</i>

18:34.571 --> 18:36.740
<i>see how far she's planning
to take this.</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.033
<i>You played
the get-out-of-jail-free card</i>

18:38.617 --> 18:39.701
<i>with the D.A. six months ago.</i>

18:40.452 --> 18:42.037
<i>We had the same conversation
about the same kid,</i>

18:42.079 --> 18:44.748
<i>who's managed to do</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:47.584
<i>screw his life again

<i>How am I supposed to know
which one?</i>

19:24.538 --> 19:25.164
<i>I mean, you eat anything.</i>

19:26.165 --> 19:27.875
<i>You mainline high-fruct--
You keep eating like that,</i>

19:31.795 --> 19:32.546
<i>Fine, oatmeal.</i>

19:33.005 --> 19:33.881
That's fucked-up.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.049
<i>Nobody likes no oatmeal cookies.</i>

19:36.550 --> 19:38.677
<i>The kind with the raisins?
I do.</i>

19:39.219 --> 19:40.137
<i>Ooh, that's-that's dark.</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:44.516
<i>That's based in some childhood
trauma shit right there.</i>

19:44.516 --> 19:46.518
<i>Come on.</i>

19:53.692 --> 19:55.903
You still got

19:56.403 --> 19:57.696
<i>-Long underwear.</i>

19:58.238 --> 19:59.781
<i>I don't know
why you keep saying that.</i>

20:00.240 --> 20:01.575
<i>It don't sound better.</i>

20:01.909 --> 20:05.204
<i>Wash the pants, too.</i>

20:17.674 --> 20:18.675
<i>What?</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:20.052
<i>You have the cash, right?</i>

20:20.594 --> 20:21.720
<i>I can go get us change
for the machines.</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:22.971
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

20:22.971 --> 20:26.350
<i>We worked too hard
for this money to spend it.</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:39.905
<i>We just got it fixed.</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:41.782
<i>It ain't supposed to do that
no more.</i>

20:42.282 --> 20:43.659
<i>-Joe?
- Yeah?</i>

20:44.243 --> 20:44.993
<i>The machine ate people's money.</i>

20:45.577 --> 20:47.579
<i>Oops. Crack her open.</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:51.041
<i>What can I get you?</i>

20:59.299 --> 21:01.009
<i>We put in five dollars, so...</i>

21:01.593 --> 21:03.595
<i>And we'll take the rest
in quarters.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:06.265

at Columbia, right?</i>

21:18.652 --> 21:19.653
<i>Yes.</i>

21:20.612 --> 21:23.699
<i>I think you may
already know this,</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:26.201
<i>but your interests are opposed.</i>

21:26.785 --> 21:27.953
<i>I can work to help your brother,</i>

21:27.953 --> 21:30.539
<i>or I can work to help
your friend Mr. Poe.</i>

21:30.914 --> 21:32.040
<i>But I can't do both.</i>

21:32.082 --> 21:36.378
<i>If I help one,
it could mean harming the other.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
<i>Someone's probably gonna have to
take the blame for this.</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:43.802
<i>So I just need to know
who my client is.</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:45.220
<i>Think about it.</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:48.765
<i>Let me know which one
you really want to help.</i>

21:49.683 --> 21:51.852
<i></i>

21:52.352 --> 21:53.687
<i>Yo. Think fast.</i>

21:56.940 --> 21:58.608
<i>This is for me?</i>

21:58.650 --> 22:00.610
<i>Yep.</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:02.821
<i>-Thanks.</i>

22:13.165 --> 22:14.374
<i>Dad, Buell's the other way.</i>

22:15.334 --> 22:17.044
<i>I've been living in this state
46 years.</i>

22:17.627 --> 22:19.046
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

22:19.504 --> 22:21.631
<i>We got another stop?</i>

22:21.882 --> 22:23.258
<i>Canada.</i>

22:23.800 --> 22:26.928
<i>-The country?
- No, the restaurant.</i>

22:27.512 --> 22:30.849
<i>-Okay.
- Yeah, the country.</i>

22:31.391 --> 22:32.225
<i>Oh, we're going to Canada?</i>

22:32.809 --> 22:34.019
<i>No, you're going to Canada.</i>

22:34.519 --> 22:35.270
<i>I'm-a take you as far as Erie.</i>

22:35.312 --> 22:38.273
<i>From there, you can hitch a boat
across to Ontario.</i>

22:39.149 --> 22:41.818
<i>You can wait it out there till
all this bullshit blows over.</i>

22:42.361 --> 22:43.612
<i>Oh, you're for real?</i>

22:43.737 --> 22:44.988
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:46.740
<i>Dad, turn the car around.</i>

22:47.199 --> 22:47.783
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, man.</i>

22:48.158 --> 22:49.242
<i>Let it sink in.</i>

22:49.242 --> 22:51.745
<i>-You're gonna be fine.
- I'm not skipping town.</i>

22:52.204 --> 22:53.121
<i>Listen, I talked to Harris.</i>

22:53.872 --> 22:56.375
<i>He didn't tell me exactly
what you did or did not do,</i>

22:57.376 --> 22:59.127
<i>but if I know anything,
it's that getting mixed up</i>

22:59.753 --> 23:02.172
<i>in the death of a cop is
the fastest way to go down.</i>

23:02.881 --> 23:06.510
<i>And from what I understand,
they're coming to get you.</i>

23:06.718 --> 23:07.344
<i>Soon.</i>

23:07.344 --> 23:09.137
<i>Now, I may not have been
the best dad in the world,</i>

23:09.137 --> 23:11.056
<i>but I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna sit by</i>

23:11.598 --> 23:13.725
<i>and watch
while they lock up my son.</i>

23:14.893 --> 23:15.644
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

23:16.019 --> 23:17.187
<i>You're welcome.</i>

23:17.729 --> 23:19.106
<i>Now let's go home.</i>

23:19.606 --> 23:21.817
<i>They are going to arrest you.</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:23.944
<i>I know that.
I'm not leaving.</i>

23:24.444 --> 23:25.028
<i>What is wrong with you, man?</i>

23:25.612 --> 23:26.863
<i>I'm just not like you.
All right?</i>

23:27.739 --> 23:29.783
<i>I don't run from my problems.</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:34.955
<i>What did you say to me?</i>

23:36.581 --> 23:37.332
<i>Say that again, man.</i>

23:37.332 --> 23:39.251
<i>What the fuck is the matter
with you, big man?</i>

23:40.043 --> 23:42.546
<i>I thought you wanted to
disrespect me to my face, huh?</i>

23:42.754 --> 23:43.338
<i>Come on.</i>

23:43.922 --> 23:45.882
<i>What...? Get the fuck
out of my truck.</i>

<i>Get the fuck out of my truck!</i>

23:49.469 --> 23:51.680
<i>Stupid piece of shit.</i>

23:52.055 --> 23:52.639
<i>I try to help you.</i>

23:53.306 --> 23:55.892
<i>You ain't worth it,
you stupid piece of shit.</i>

24:04.484 --> 24:07.779
<i>Worthless piece of fucking shit!</i>

25:01.791 --> 25:03.877
<i>-Chief, this is Dr. Burke.
- What do we got?</i>

25:04.336 --> 25:05.253
<i>A couple OD'd at Cliffwood.</i>

25:06.004 --> 25:07.005
<i>They were there watching
their son play Little League.</i>

25:07.506 --> 25:08.215
<i>Tom and Melanie Bayer.</i>

Just barely.</i>

25:10.550 --> 25:12.177
<i>Tom's still out, but Melanie's
up and ready to talk.</i>

25:12.886 --> 25:14.012
<i>Their kid is with a grandmother
who was on the scene.</i>

25:14.513 --> 25:15.305
<i>I called it in to CPS.</i>

<i>They're sending someone,
should be here in a few hours.</i>

<i>What'd they OD on?</i>

25:19.226 --> 25:21.102
<i>Fentanyl,
according to the tox screen.</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:24.147
<i>But Melanie insists
they didn't take anything.</i>

25:24.689 --> 25:26.399
<i>Says they did some coke,
that's all.</i>

25:26.441 --> 25:29.361
<i>-So, what, she's lying?
- Not necessarily.</i>

25:29.361 --> 25:31.488
<i>People have been in
saying the same thing.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:34.115
<i>Maybe they're mixing
the drugs together on purpose,</i>

25:34.574 --> 25:35.283
<i>maybe by accident,</i>

25:35.283 --> 25:37.869
<i>or maybe they're just
buying it that way.</i>

25:38.161 --> 25:39.913
<i>Shall we?</i>

25:45.835 --> 25:48.046
<i>Tom and me, we've used before.</i>

25:48.547 --> 25:49.464
<i>A few times.</i>

25:49.506 --> 25:51.132
<i>But nothing like this
ever happened.</i>

25:51.716 --> 25:53.802
<i>When you say "use," you mean?</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:55.053
<i>Coke. Cocaine.</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:56.346
<i>We snort it.</i>

25:56.388 --> 25:59.099
<i>You and your husband
ever use opioids?</i>

25:59.599 --> 26:00.392
<i>No, never.</i>

26:00.392 --> 26:03.311
<i>So the cocaine you were doing
had fentanyl in it.</i>

26:03.853 --> 26:06.940
<i>I-I guess.
We didn't know that.</i>

26:07.399 --> 26:08.233
<i>Where do you usually pick up?</i>

26:08.858 --> 26:11.027
<i>You'll be talking
to Child Services next.</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:12.362
<i>When they call me,</i>

26:13.071 --> 26:15.031
<i>I can either say you cooperated
or I can say you didn't.</i>

26:15.282 --> 26:16.116
<i>Your choice.</i>

26:16.616 --> 26:19.869
<i>Uh, Tom said it was
a new guy...</i>

26:20.078 --> 26:20.620
<i>this time.</i>

26:21.121 --> 26:23.206
<i>He never let me go
with him before,</i>

26:23.790 --> 26:26.293
<i>but we were on our way
to Sam's Club...</i>

26:26.751 --> 26:27.961
<i>And where was this?</i>

26:28.295 --> 26:31.172
<i>Um, uh... Um...</i>

26:31.172 --> 26:34.509
<i>Palm Gardens,
that complex over in Newell,</i>

26:34.551 --> 26:38.680
<i>the one with the white trees
on the sign.</i>

26:39.598 --> 26:41.308
<i>I was watching to make sure
he was all right.</i>

26:41.349 --> 26:44.311
<i>It was an apartment
on the first floor.</i>

26:44.311 --> 26:48.273
<i>I remember P
'cause our boy's name is Paul.</i>

26:48.815 --> 26:50.942
<i>Uh, the guy kind
of looked like God.</i>

26:51.234 --> 26:52.277
<i>Like what?</i>

26:52.902 --> 26:56.990
<i>Like Jesus Christ,
the hair and everything.</i>

27:02.412 --> 27:03.997
<i>Is this him?</i>

27:04.456 --> 27:05.373
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I think it is.</i>

27:05.415 --> 27:08.293
<i>And you only picked up
from him the one time?</i>

27:08.793 --> 27:09.294
<i>Right.</i>

27:09.919 --> 27:11.254
<i>Okay. Who was your dealer
before him?</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:14.215
<i>Like I said,
Tom never let me go before.</i>

27:14.674 --> 27:15.258
<i>Was this him?</i>

27:15.759 --> 27:17.093
<i>I just don't know.</i>

27:17.636 --> 27:19.763
<i>tense music</i>

27:40.033 --> 27:40.992
<i>Police!</i>

<i>Clear.</i>

28:03.973 --> 28:05.183
<i>Yeah?</i>

28:05.725 --> 28:06.351
<i>Hello, ma'am,
Officers Harris and Park,</i>

28:06.893 --> 28:08.520
<i>-here with a few questions.
- Who?</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:11.690
<i>Police officers
with questions, ma'am.</i>

28:12.357 --> 28:14.984
<i>I don't see a badge.</i>

28:16.695 --> 28:20.240
<i>Closer. Closer.</i>

28:29.874 --> 28:30.542
<i>Yeah?</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:32.293
<i>What can you tell us
about the man</i>

28:32.752 --> 28:34.170
<i>who lives in apartment P?</i>

28:34.170 --> 28:35.171
<i>Bobby?</i>

28:35.714 --> 28:37.966
<i>That depends. This Bobby?</i>

28:38.091 --> 28:39.217
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:39.217 --> 28:42.095
<i>And what did you say
his last name was?</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:44.222
<i>I didn't. Jesus.</i>

28:44.764 --> 28:46.141
<i>Can you tell us what it is?</i>

28:46.516 --> 28:48.017
<i>I just said, Jesus.</i>

28:48.393 --> 28:49.561
<i>You're-You're telling us</i>

28:49.602 --> 28:52.439
<i>that-that this man's name
is Bobby Jesus?</i>

28:52.897 --> 28:54.190
<i>-Yeah.
- Is he...</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:55.525
<i>is he, like, Latin?</i>

28:56.025 --> 28:57.610
<i>-Like Bobby Jesús?
- No.</i>

28:57.652 --> 29:00.196
<i>I would've know if I had
one of them living here.</i>

29:00.780 --> 29:01.698
<i>Okay.
Did he leave any paperwork</i>

29:01.698 --> 29:04.284
<i>with his name on it,
ever pay by check?</i>

29:04.784 --> 29:05.869
<i>He paid cash.</i>

29:06.786 --> 29:09.289
<i>Did you ever consider that
that name might not be real?</i>

29:09.789 --> 29:10.540
<i>Cash always was.</i>

29:11.082 --> 29:12.333
<i>Have you seen him around
recently?</i>

29:12.375 --> 29:15.295
<i>He paid for the month,
and he went on a trip.</i>

29:15.795 --> 29:17.088
<i>Did he say where he was off to?</i>

29:17.255 --> 29:18.548
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:20.592
<i>Did Jesus have any family
in the area,</i>

29:21.134 --> 29:23.178
<i>friends who you often
see around?</i>

29:23.470 --> 29:24.345
<i>I don't know.</i>

29:24.387 --> 29:25.513
<i>How about the apostles,
you see any of them?</i>

29:25.972 --> 29:27.307
<i>-Huh?
- Okay, Steve.</i>

29:27.307 --> 29:30.101
<i>How about him,
have you seen him around?</i>

29:30.435 --> 29:33.062
<i>Closer. Closer.</i>

29:36.483 --> 29:37.984
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

29:41.613 --> 29:42.989
<i>You good?</i>

29:44.240 --> 29:45.408
<i>No, I just ran out of time.</i>

29:45.408 --> 29:48.244
<i>Don't worry. We got a name
and a known address.</i>

29:48.787 --> 29:50.121
<i>We'll find the guy.</i>

29:50.413 --> 29:52.123
<i>We always do.</i>

<i>Here, get nice and close.</i>

30:17.941 --> 30:18.399
<i>The sparkle.</i>

30:18.942 --> 30:19.567
<i>You see that?</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:20.485
<i>It's shimmering.</i>

30:21.027 --> 30:24.197
<i>And it's only $69.99.</i>

31:04.195 --> 31:05.196
<i>Grace?</i>

31:05.655 --> 31:07.532
<i>I just wanted to say sorry.</i>

31:07.574 --> 31:10.410
<i>I'm sorry I didn't sign
your petition thing.</i>

31:10.994 --> 31:11.703
<i>I know a lot of people did,</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:13.872
<i>and I talked to Marcus
like I said I would,</i>

31:14.873 --> 31:18.334
<i>but he didn't want me
getting wrapped up in it, so...</i>

31:20.712 --> 31:22.672
<i>You know I love you, right?</i>

31:23.256 --> 31:26.217
<i>-I do love you.
- Jillian, it's okay.</i>

31:27.552 --> 31:29.888
<i>I know that.</i>

32:29.989 --> 32:30.615
<i>Can I get you some water?</i>

32:31.115 --> 32:33.618
<i>Just surprised is all.</i>

32:34.160 --> 32:35.411
<i>Look, I'm looking for Billy.
He here?</i>

32:35.954 --> 32:37.705
<i>Hasn't been around today.</i>

32:38.289 --> 32:39.624
<i>I'm gonna get you some water.</i>

- Really,</i>

33:02.146 --> 33:03.314
<i>Thanks.</i>

33:03.773 --> 33:05.358

- Ran off.</i>

<i>I wasn't planning on it.</i>

<i>Sorry.</i>

33:25.169 --> 33:26.629
<i>You taking this stuff?</i>

33:27.171 --> 33:29.215
<i>Saw a few people
in the hospital today</i>

<i>on account of it.</i>

33:30.842 --> 33:32.343
<i>Be-be careful, all right?</i>

33:32.677 --> 33:34.220
<i>I'm careful.</i>

<i>You mind my asking
where you get this filled?</i>

<i>Jackson.</i>

33:50.153 --> 33:51.654
<i>We're all on something, right?</i>

33:51.696 --> 33:55.491
<i>He's helping me kick
a couple prescriptions, too.</i>

33:55.533 --> 33:58.244
<i>Slowly.</i>

33:59.162 --> 33:59.871
<i>Jackson's a good guy.</i>

34:00.413 --> 34:02.582
<i>He even lets me hand back
the extra pills</i>

34:03.082 --> 34:04.876
<i>so I'm not tempted to take them.</i>

34:04.876 --> 34:08.129
<i>If you're the type
that needs that kind of help...</i>

34:09.047 --> 34:13.051
<i>well, then, I guess it's nice
he does it for you.</i>

<i>Someone took a bat
to the taillights.</i>

34:59.847 --> 35:03.434
<i>You also got a new paint job.
Who did it?</i>

35:03.768 --> 35:04.811
<i>Gelsey, probably.</i>

35:05.311 --> 35:07.021
<i>We handed in the cards today.</i>

35:07.021 --> 35:08.940
<i>He threatened to shut the shop

<i>Lee, I'm not trying
to defend myself.</i>

38:25.970 --> 38:27.847

<i>-Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?</i>

<i>Like you think I don't really
understand what that means.</i>

<i>That's not
what I meant to look like.</i>

38:34.270 --> 38:36.355
<i>I meant to look
like I'm freaked out.</i>

38:37.315 --> 38:39.567
<i>I don't want anything
to happen to you.</i>

38:39.859 --> 38:41.652

<i>I care for you.</i>

38:44.363 --> 38:45.948
<i>I'm scared for you, that's all.</i>

38:46.490 --> 38:47.742
<i>slow, contemplative music</i>

38:56.083 --> 38:59.170
<i>I like hearing that you care
what happens to me.</i>

38:59.712 --> 39:01.630
<i>'Cause you left,
and for a long time,</i>

39:02.006 --> 39:03.507
<i>it felt like you didn't.</i>

39:07.511 --> 39:09.847
<i>You want to come up
to the house?</i>

39:10.389 --> 39:12.808
<i>I need to check on my dad.</i>

39:13.809 --> 39:16.687
<i>Meet me
at the football stands later?</i>

39:17.146 --> 39:18.898
<i>-Just so we can--
- Okay.</i>

39:19.357 --> 39:21.692
<i>-Okay?
- Okay.</i>

40:13.411 --> 40:15.413
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>

40:27.258 --> 40:29.969
<i>-Chief.
Time for a shave.</i>

40:30.594 --> 40:32.638
<i>And your mom
needs to give you a haircut.</i>

40:32.930 --> 40:33.973
<i>Clean you up.</i>

40:34.473 --> 40:36.559
<i>Sheriff's gonna want a mug shot.</i>

40:36.767 --> 40:38.477
<i>Okay.</i>

40:46.986 --> 40:50.781
<i>Can you give me a minute
with my son, please?</i>

41:10.676 --> 41:12.845
<i>tense, dramatic music</i>

41:16.182 --> 41:18.684
<i>Surprise.</i>

41:20.936 --> 41:23.147
You don't have to talk
to me about it. It's okay.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.065
<i>But Del,</i>

41:25.608 --> 41:26.358
<i>he's gonna make sure</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:29.278
<i>you get the best public defender
in the county,</i>

41:29.278 --> 41:32.656
<i>and you're gonna need
to talk to her.</i>

41:37.495 --> 41:39.830
<i>I don't know what it is
with you.</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:44.668
<i>The both of us.</i>

41:45.711 --> 41:48.297
<i>Some fucked-up reason,</i>

41:48.839 --> 41:52.051
<i>we think
we don't deserve good things.</i>

41:55.513 --> 41:57.681
<i>But we do.</i>

41:58.891 --> 42:00.518
<i>We do.</i>

42:01.352 --> 42:03.854
<i>So let's get you out of this,</i>

42:04.355 --> 42:06.023
<i>find a way to make it right,</i>

42:06.065 --> 42:09.151
<i>because you deserve
to live a good life.</i>

42:09.568 --> 42:12.071
<i>We both do.</i>

42:23.249 --> 42:25.668
<i>How do I look?</i>

42:35.094 --> 42:36.387
<i>I believe in you.</i>

42:36.929 --> 42:39.682
<i>And I am with you
every step of the way.</i>

42:39.890 --> 42:40.891
<i>Okay?</i>

42:41.058 --> 42:43.686
<i>Okay.</i>

42:44.562 --> 42:46.689
<i>We're gonna figure this out.</i>

42:52.945 --> 42:55.614
<i>-What's that?
- It's from Dad.</i>

43:50.085 --> 43:51.587
<i>She didn't tell you?</i>

43:51.629 --> 43:54.298
<i>-No, she never did mention--
- Well, okay.</i>

43:54.298 --> 43:56.508
<i>Sh-She marched right up to me
after class.</i>

43:57.009 --> 43:58.177
<i>-And-and she explained</i>

43:58.802 --> 44:02.389
<i>exactly why
the paper I-I just presented</i>

44:02.848 --> 44:06.060
<i>-was wrong.</i>

44:06.435 --> 44:07.311
<i>Sounds like my girl.</i>

44:07.311 --> 44:09.438
<i>Two sentences in, and I knew.</i>

44:09.480 --> 44:11.148
<i>-I-I was looking at her</i>

44:11.690 --> 44:14.068
<i>and seeing my future.</i>

44:14.652 --> 44:15.361
<i>Your future of being told</i>

44:15.402 --> 44:18.280
<i>you're wrong
every time you open your mouth.</i>

44:18.322 --> 44:19.907
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

44:20.199 --> 44:20.783
<i>Yes.</i>

44:21.325 --> 44:22.242
<i>I just accept the fact</i>

44:22.826 --> 44:24.203
<i>that sometimes she's operating</i>

44:24.244 --> 44:27.206
<i>on a whole other level.</i>

44:27.706 --> 44:29.958
<i>somber, dramatic music</i>

44:39.051 --> 44:41.720
<i>You're gonna get charged,
then arraigned.</i>

44:42.680 --> 44:44.473
<i>There's a chance you make bail,
but if you don't,</i>

44:45.015 --> 44:47.226
<i>you could be headed
to Farmington.</i>

44:49.687 --> 44:52.439
<i>It's the tri-county prison.
Holds a whole mix of folks.</i>

44:52.981 --> 44:54.191
<i>Some misdemeanor convictions,</i>

44:54.233 --> 44:56.735
<i>others awaiting trial
for felonies.</i>

44:57.361 --> 44:58.821
<i>Felonies make up a big chunk
of the population,</i>

44:59.863 --> 45:03.117
<i>so keep your head down.
Mind your own business.</i>

45:03.492 --> 45:04.326
<i>You have a quick temper,</i>

45:04.368 --> 45:07.996
<i>which got you into this mess
in the first place.</i>

45:08.372 --> 45:09.289
<i>And you're a big guy.</i>

45:09.832 --> 45:12.126
<i>Someone'll test you.
Do not engage.</i>

45:12.501 --> 45:14.294
<i>Just walk away.</i>

45:14.753 --> 45:16.714
<i>You hear me, Billy?</i>

45:18.716 --> 45:21.885
<i>Billy? You hear me?</i>

45:40.237 --> 45:43.115
I've been in love
with the same guy for six years.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.200
<i>Went to high school together.</i>

45:45.784 --> 45:47.953
<i>Pretty much did
all his homework.</i>

45:49.788 --> 45:50.706
<i>He dated my sister
for a long time,</i>

45:50.748 --> 45:55.002
<i>but then she married
someone else, and...</i>

45:55.419 --> 45:56.420
<i>Figured it was over,</i>

45:56.462 --> 46:00.132
<i>but he still wanted to see me
all the time.</i>

46:00.424 --> 46:02.259
<i>I don't know, I...</i>

46:02.801 --> 46:06.013
<i>made a move, tried to kiss him.</i>

46:06.305 --> 46:09.141
<i>He turned me down.</i>

46:10.392 --> 46:11.351
<i>The day I left,</i>

46:11.935 --> 46:14.021
<i>I walked in on him
fucking my sister.</i>

46:14.062 --> 46:15.230
<i>And?</i>

46:15.773 --> 46:16.482
<i>I don't know. I guess...</i>

46:16.523 --> 46:19.902
<i>-Why are you smiling?
- Because I'm pathetic.</i>

46:20.110 --> 46:21.820
<i>Right?</i>

46:22.321 --> 46:24.573
<i>It's funny. It's kind of funny.</i>

46:25.115 --> 46:26.450
<i>I don't think
your pain is funny.</i>

46:26.950 --> 46:28.410
<i>I'm just trying to say</i>

46:29.161 --> 46:30.662
<i>that you don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.</i>

46:30.704 --> 46:32.289
<i>-I'm someone that--
- Man, the food here</i>

46:32.581 --> 46:33.540
<i>take too long.</i>

46:34.082 --> 46:35.542
<i>It's only been, like,
ten minutes.</i>

46:35.542 --> 46:37.586
<i>Shit we ordered
don't take that long to cook.</i>

46:38.128 --> 46:39.171
<i>And what'd I tell you
about sitting</i>

46:39.630 --> 46:40.339
<i>with your back to the door?</i>

46:40.964 --> 46:42.841
<i>-You took the other seat.
- I got to pee.</i>

47:04.029 --> 47:05.531
<i>-Here you go, sugar.
- Thanks.</i>

47:06.031 --> 47:06.740
<i>Can I get anything else for you?</i>

47:06.782 --> 47:09.785
<i>Um, sh-she's gonna ask
for whipped cream on that.</i>

47:10.369 --> 47:12.871
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

47:26.885 --> 47:28.428
<i>Okay, you tell me when.</i>

47:37.646 --> 47:39.982
<i>When.</i>

47:45.904 --> 47:47.281
<i>suspenseful, dramatic music</i>

49:21.291 --> 49:24.044
<i>somber, plaintive music</i>

50:34.573 --> 50:37.576
<i>Goddamn it. Chuck.</i>

50:38.076 --> 50:39.453
<i>You scared the shit out of me.</i>

50:40.412 --> 50:41.538
<i>-This is what happens</i>

50:42.080 --> 50:44.041
<i>when you don't call me back.</i>

50:44.750 --> 50:45.834
<i>I've been busy. I, uh...</i>

50:45.876 --> 50:47.878
<i>I didn't realize
it was time-sensitive.</i>

50:48.420 --> 50:49.671
<i>In the last ten years,</i>

50:50.213 --> 50:52.674
<i>-how often have I called you?
- Right.</i>

50:53.216 --> 50:54.885
<i>I mean, it's been ten years.</i>

50:55.427 --> 50:58.096
<i>How urgent could it be?</i>

51:01.391 --> 51:05.437
I'm here to collect
on that debt, my friend.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.439
<i>You ready?</i>

51:08.398 --> 51:10.317
<i>intriguing, dramatic music</i>
