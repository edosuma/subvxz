00:38.205 --> 00:40.628
I just had the strangest dream.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.669
It's Friday.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.178
We're at the hospital.

00:45.337 --> 00:49.808
But it's not a hospital,
it's a forest of sorts.

00:50.133 --> 00:56.561
And I know that because
right next to you there's a bear.

00:56.848 --> 01:01.695
A grizzly, cooling his feet in a stream.

01:01.853 --> 01:06.199
And all of a sudden,
you begin to deliver...

01:06.358 --> 01:09.532
...and I can't get to you.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.493
But the bear can.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.913
And next thing I know...

01:15.075 --> 01:20.172
...he is holding our beautiful baby boy.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.293
And here's where it gets odd. Uh ....

01:25.002 --> 01:26.720
He chews the cord.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.341
But, strangely, I'm okay with it.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.685
That's gotta be a good sign.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.487
Theodore. Loved it.

01:44.646 --> 01:48.401
But remember that article I told you about?
Naming kids after famous people?

01:48.567 --> 01:53.118
I don't want Teddy to think he's a failure
if he doesn't wind up on Mount Rushmore.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.703
This was tough, because it's mythological.
Round Table, the whole deal.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.837
But "The Name Game." Remember that?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.088
"The Name Game"?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.716
"Art-Art-bo-Bart, Banana-Fauna-fo-Fart."

02:04.875 --> 02:06.127
Brings us to Casey.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.761
This whole next slew of names:

02:07.919 --> 02:11.469
Casey, Jordan, Dylan, Drew, Taylor,
Tyler and probably mostly Skylar...

02:11.632 --> 02:13.760
...are all names that
could be girls' names.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.519
Why don't we just out to the chase
and call him Cindy?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.814
Yeah, Atlanta.
Trying to get out of this place.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.774
- Denver's where it's at, man.
- Mm-hm.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.190
They got the whole underground
government conspiracy thing going on.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.984
- That so?
- I'm hearing a lot of chatter...

02:31.360 --> 02:33.533
- ...on the message boards.
- Gotcha. I should grab this.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.413
- Sorry. Hey, honey.
- Hey, sweetie.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.745
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.912
I'm about halfway through it.
I thought I'd take a little break.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.924
Ha, ha. I didn't want you to think I was
arbitrarily dismissing those names.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.550
You considered them carefully.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.585
It's just such a big decision, you know?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.756
I know.
Clearly, you're taking it very seriously.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.765
More importantly,
what are you wearing?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.096
Armani Exchange.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.228
I'm talking to my--
No, no, that's just the driver, baby.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.266
Okay, listen, I'm about to be dropped off.
I should go.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.607
- I love you, can't wait to see you.
- I love you too. Safe flying.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.361
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.488
Yep.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.450
What in the eff?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.536
- Goddamn it!
- We done knocked it right off.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.293
Hey, man! You just hit my car!

03:21.451 --> 03:24.125
- You just knocked my door off, man.
- Sorry about that.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.130
First things first,
is everybody okay?

03:26.289 --> 03:28.758
I'm in a Town Car!
Don't you know airport protocol?

03:28.917 --> 03:31.420
Town Cars have the right of way always!

03:50.147 --> 03:52.650
That right there is some serious damage.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.942
That ain't shit!

03:54.985 --> 03:57.363
My brother-in-law
is gonna kill me. I'm through!

03:57.529 --> 03:58.826
You okay?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.991
Sorry about my friend.
He's been drinking.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.661
You smell boozy too.
Drinking and driving together?

04:03.827 --> 04:05.670
Well, we haven't been drinking.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.834
I mean, we split a six-pack.
Of 40s. But ....

04:10.000 --> 04:11.627
You know what?

04:11.835 --> 04:13.929
My father always had a saying:

04:14.087 --> 04:16.930
When a day starts like this,
it's all uphill from here.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.012
That's actually incorrect.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.928
- My dad used to say it.
- No, it's all downhill from here.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.439
Everybody wants to be up.
Nobody wants to be down.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.852
It's easier as you go down.
He didn't know what he was talking about.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.862
- Hey, Shelby? We good?
- We're cool, man. I'll take care of it.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.773
- Okay.
- Go get them, Hollywood!

04:32.939 --> 04:35.362
Excuse me. Sir?
You mind picking these up?

04:35.525 --> 04:39.530
I can't. You're not supposed to touch
other people's luggage at an airport.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.374
Handle your own baggage.

04:58.882 --> 04:59.883
Bag check!

05:01.468 --> 05:04.142
- This your bag, sir?
- Is there a problem?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.399
- I'm gonna have to Search it real quick, sir.
- Yeah. Feel free.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.277
Mad magazine? That's cute.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.528
That's not mine.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.234
- This is your bag?
- That's not--

05:16.191 --> 05:17.238
Jackpot

05:17.400 --> 05:20.074
That's definitely not mine.
My bag got switched with this--

05:20.237 --> 05:22.365
- You packed your bag yourself?
- But not that.

05:22.531 --> 05:26.252
I've never done drugs in my life.
This is absolutely" This is crazy.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.911
Maybe you a drug mule.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.582
- Do I look like a drug mule?
- I don't know, how do drug mules look?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.921
- You're the expert.
- What, like me?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.757
- Who said that?
- Your eyes.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.219
My eyes said something? Did my mouth?
I don't think you look like a--

05:39.756 --> 05:43.135
Do you mind not tossing it up so much?

05:43.552 --> 05:46.055
Whoo! Funky motherfucker, ain't you?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.515
You are so inappropriate, it's crazy.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.060
I been called a lot of things,
but "inappropriate"'?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.069
That's some fucked-up shit, yo.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.050
Oh, my goodness.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.461
Look at this, Sonny.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.799
Fancy.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.971
Died and gone to heaven.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.793
Are you not aware
that there's a person here?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.252
Sorry.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.500
Well, hello!

06:58.501 --> 07:00.003
How you doing?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.172
What brings you up to first class?

07:02.339 --> 07:04.341
The seat that I procured--

07:04.507 --> 07:05.679
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.312
I was in low class, and my seat belt
didn't work, and they bumped me up.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.518
It's called economy.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.024
Lucky day. Nice to see you.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.523
Sorry how we met, but, you know ....

07:19.189 --> 07:20.862
Oh, you know what?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.994
- I think we switched our bags at the curb.
- I know we did.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.872
Your bag was confiscated.
It had paraphernalia in it.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.206
Marijuana pipe.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.540
Well, that's a medical apparatus.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.125
- I have glaucoma.
- Sure, you have glaucoma.

07:35.288 --> 07:39.543
Attention, in preparation for takeoff,
please turn off all electronic devices...

07:39.709 --> 07:43.589
...and if you have a laptop, please stow it.
Thank you and enjoy your flight.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.883
They made the announcement.
You should turn that off.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.348
- Yeah, I get it.
- Just turn it off. You know why?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.479
- I'm gonna turn it off.
- They get uneasy...

07:51.638 --> 07:55.063
...because they know terrorists use their
phones to trigger bombs in their luggage.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.568
Shh. Pst, pst, pst.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.400
- That's not the word you want to say.
- "Terrorist" or "bomb"?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.405
- You said both the words.
- I understand.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.444
- I'm trying to tell you that I read--
- Stop trying to tell me and listen.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.113
Don't say words
that put people on edge.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.498
- I'm trying to be informative.
- It's not cool.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.752
Would you and your friend mind
stepping to the front of the plane?

08:13.910 --> 08:14.911
My friend?

08:15.078 --> 08:17.877
I'm sorry, I need you
to come with me, please.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.919
Listen. This clown,
I've never seen before in my life.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.383
That's not true.
We switched bags at curbside.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.594
- That was an accident. And he had--
- Sir!

08:26.756 --> 08:29.600
Federal air marshal.
Please step to the front of the plane.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.056
What? Why?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.596
Drop the device.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.436
- It's not a device, it's a BlackBerry.
- Drop the device!

08:35.597 --> 08:37.770
What are you gonna do, rent-a-cop?
Shoot me--?

08:40.395 --> 08:42.523
It's okay, everyone. He'll be fine.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.111
It's only a rubber bullet.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.909
Good news, Mr. Highman.
They found your bags on the airplane.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.999
- Oh, good.
- Unfortunately, that plane's over Kansas.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.336
- Figures.
- But I do have your cell phone for you.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.966
Now, if you wouldn't mind just signing this.
It's a simple release.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.254
So I don't sue you.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.765
Just saying we acted in accordance
with state law.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.925
- Sure did.
- Good.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.811
If you put your address there,
I'll have your bags shipped.

09:13.970 --> 09:18.476
Let them land at LAX and I'll pick them up
when I get there. When's the next flight?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.816
- In an hour, but you won't be on it.
- Why's that?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.480
You're on the No-Fly list.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.025
- Why?
- It says right here.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.994
- You and your friend.
- Who?

09:30.153 --> 09:33.874
- The gentlemen I just interviewed.
- I've never seen that dipshit before.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.079
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.962
- He had nice things to say about you.
- I'm on a No-Fly list? This is ridiculous.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.337
- Regardless-
- No.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.297
I have a pregnant wife, I have to get back.
This is a huge misunderstanding.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.342
- What am I supposed to do?
- Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?

09:48.671 --> 09:49.672
Yes.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.139
Well, he ran across country,
and he was pretty stupid.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.349
So I have faith in you.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.852
You're free to leave.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.975
What kind of incident?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.018
I'm probably overstating.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.859
It's the manageable kind.
A micro-incident.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.197
But it unfortunately landed me
on a No-Fly list.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.870
What did you do, Peter?
Did you snap at somebody?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.373
Nope. I did not. I was cool,
calm and collected the whole time.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.661
I was completely in my rights.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.545
You get so carried away sometimes.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.046
How are you gonna get home?

10:22.205 --> 10:24.708
I have a plan.
And the plan is sorting itself out.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.468
- But my wallet is traveling.
- What?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.881
The ID's in it, I've been trying
to rent e car, I had the office fax--

10:31.047 --> 10:33.641
But I am exhausting any
and all opportunities to--

10:36.344 --> 10:39.143
Hey! I've been looking all over for you.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.058
- Stay away from me.
- But I found something of yours.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.650
Honey, this might all be solved.
I'll call you right back.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.488
Peter?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.566
You got my stuff?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.699
- I grabbed it before they zip-tied me.
- Rally Monkey?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.280
- You get my wallet?
- I didn't see it.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.698
Where's my bag?

10:56.865 --> 11:00.085
I saw your bag, but I didn't grab it
because my hands were full.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.245
You know, I had this thing in my hand.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.090
- What kind of car did you get?
- I didn't, because I don't have a license...

11:06.249 --> 11:09.219
...because it's in my wallet
that's on the .... Right?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.671
Oh, shoot. What a bummer.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.381
Yeah, bummer.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.300
Thanks for the doll.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.935
Fucking idiot.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.388
Hey, you wanna ride with us?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.600
No, I'm fine.
I'm not really a big dog person.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.189
Look, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.401
But I have a really great personality
once you get to know me.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.407
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.786
I got 90 friends on Facebook.
Twelve pending, but I got 90 friends.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.122
I'll cover expenses.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.375
You can pay me back
when we get to Hollywood.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.251
- L.A.
- Huh?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.209
It's not called Hollywood.
It's Los Angeles.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.628
Yeah, but I'm going to Hollywood.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.252
What's your name?

11:50.585 --> 11:51.632
Peter.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.717
My name's Ethan. Ethan Trembling.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.803
And this little guy...

11:56.132 --> 11:57.805
...this little butterball...

11:57.967 --> 11:59.514
...this is Sonny.

11:59.677 --> 12:04.478
And we would be honored
to have you ride with us. Come on.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.567
It'll be fun.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.332
JK. LOL.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.617
HI. "Hop in."

12:28.748 --> 12:30.625
Life's weird, isn't it? Buckle up.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.723
- You have any brothers or sisters?
- No.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.135
- You have a dog?
- Nope.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.848
What's your favorite color?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.858
- Blue.
- That's so cool. Mine's green.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.690
Wow.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.527
- Do you like hot dogs?
- Yes, I do.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.488
I'm more of a corn-dog man, myself.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.369
I once ate a foot-long corn dog
on a nude beach.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.950
I'll never do that again.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.201
- At what age did you lose your virginity?
- I'm not gonna discuss that.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.790
- I was 9 years old.
- Boy.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.876
Great gal. Great gal.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.381
Sheila Pimples.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.293
I'm getting a headache,
not because of you.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.507
It's just, I'm under a lot of pressure.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.468
My wife and I are having a baby.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.349
- On Friday. That's who the monkey's for.
- Oh, really?

13:20.508 --> 13:22.055
- Yep. C-section.
- That's sweet.

13:22.719 --> 13:27.316
- So if we could just .... Thanks.
- I understand. God, I totally understand.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.477
I was supposed to meet
a big time agent in Hollywood.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.520
Luckily, he postponed.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.314
- So you're an actor.
- Yep.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.323
Yep. You know what?

13:36.482 --> 13:39.656
In fact, I wouldn't mind having
a fresh pair of eyes--

13:39.819 --> 13:41.071
Hey, hey, hey.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.749
My apologies. Look at this.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.036
- Okay. If you'd just look at the road.
- I got it.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.079
- Oh, your headshots.
- Headshots.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.090
This one, this is a laid-back guy
with a Hawaiian shirt...

13:53.249 --> 13:54.592
...but he packs a piece.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.094
- Interesting.
- Yep.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.963
This one was my father's favorite.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.762
He says it really showed my spirit.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.096
And I agree with him.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.386
What's that, a--'?

14:05.553 --> 14:08.727
That's a gang member,
a construction worker, and ....

14:08.890 --> 14:10.267
And a nerd. A professor.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.686
No. I'm Malcolm X.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.205
He thinks he's human. So stupid.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.327
What brought you to Atlanta?
Business or pleasure?

14:29.494 --> 14:30.791
- Business.
- Business.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.130
What kind of business?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.129
Architecture.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.795
- How'd you get into architecture?
- College. Anything else?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.804
- Because I'm trying to--
- I'm sorry.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.467
We're gonna be traveling.
It wouldn't hurt to get to know each other.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.561
Okay.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.848
Ethan, what brought you to Atlanta?
Business or pleasure?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.311
My daddy died.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.317
I went to Atlanta to go to his funeral.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.320
Gee, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.232
He was a great guy, man.
That's why I'm heading out West.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.652
He's the one that motivated me
to get on the TV.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.161
TV?
Ea h.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.455
Tough business to break into.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.115
So competitive.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.284
I have a friend, he's in that industry.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.204
- Does he work on Two and a Half Men?
- No. He--

15:13.371 --> 15:15.794
That's too bad.
Because Two and a Half Men...

15:15.957 --> 15:18.085
...is the reason I wanted
to become an actor.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.049
- Right.
- Especially the second season.

15:21.712 --> 15:22.964
Here's the plan.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.179
We are just outside Birmingham...

15:25.341 --> 15:29.687
...and we got a late start, so we will
only make it just to inside Louisiana.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.314
Early to bed, early to rise.

15:31.472 --> 15:35.568
Long 16- to 18-hour haul,
which will land us in Phoenix, Arizona.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.229
- Eight hours outside of L.A.
- You know what'd be nice?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.148
If we could stop at the Grand Canyon.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.191
We're not going to the Grand Canyon.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.907
That would be easily 120 miles off
our optimum route.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.241
That's too bad.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.866
Daddy would've loved
the Grand Canyon.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.329
Why do you even have this?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.665
Oh, because this is my daddy.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.042
These are his ashes.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.883
Why are your father's ashes
in a coffee can, Ethan?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.211
Because he's dead, Peter.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.052
- I know. I know that part.
- Don't you listen to anything?

16:05.214 --> 16:08.718
I'm just saying,
normal people put remains in an urn.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.519
This is vacuum-sealed.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.181
You broke the seal
when you poured out the coffee.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.897
You poured your father's remains in
and closed it. That didn't reseal it.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.609
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.072
God. We shouldn't have come here.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.040
I'm allergic to waffles.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.456
Come on, Sonny. Thank you.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.426
We need to make a brief pit stop
in Birmingham.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.429
Actually, our next stop is Shreveport.
That's where we rest.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.091
- It's 10 minutes away.
- Let's see if we can make it.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.136
Why you making a pit stop in Birmingham?
We gotta make time.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.270
I left my glaucoma medication
on the plane.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.272
Wait, wait, wait. Your what?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.933
You mean your weed?

16:57.099 --> 16:59.477
- It's medical marijuana, Peter.
- No, it's weed.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.988
- Why do you make everything so dark?
- It's weed.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.400
I'm saying I really don't want to stop
and buy drugs. Is that okay?

17:05.650 --> 17:08.779
I didn't want to play this card,
certainly not this early.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.789
But guess what. Guess who's got
the Subaru Impreza. Me.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.665
Guess who's got all the money. Me.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.292
Guess who's got
a winning personality. Me.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.251
What do you have?
You have a nice hairline, fine.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.790
You have a strong jaw, fine.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.925
But I gotta tell you something, mister.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.462
Your personality needs some work.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.005
My God.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.594
Now, do you want a ride
to California or not?

17:29.757 --> 17:32.180
- Yes, please.
- Good. Hold Dad.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.971
- Dad!
- I'm sorry. I got it. I got it, I got it.

17:38.641 --> 17:42.271
Okay. God Almighty, holy moly.
It's like I'm traveling with a Child.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.110
- Did you use the restroom?
- I need to take a pee-pee.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.620
- Peter?
- Crisis averted, I'm driving.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.496
- Driving how?
- Let me talk to her.

17:52.655 --> 17:56.159
With a guy- Please don't.
With a guy that I met in a rent-a-car.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.999
You're gonna drive 2000 miles
with a guy you just met?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.287
Say hi to--

18:00.454 --> 18:03.879
Sarah? Hi, this is Ethan Tremblay.
I'm riding with Peter. How are you?

18:04.292 --> 18:06.215
I'm fine. How are you?

18:06.377 --> 18:10.007
Good, good. I wanted to let you know
I have your package, and he is A-okay.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.345
And I will have him
delivered by Thursday.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.681
Thank you so much.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.973
Hey, Sarah? One other thing.
Do you have a hairdresser out West?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.642
I got this killer perm,
and it needs major upkeep.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.231
I'm sorry, did you say
that you have a perm?

18:23.394 --> 18:25.192
Yeah, a perm. Like a permanent.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.027
- It's heinous.
- Do you mind?

18:27.189 --> 18:30.068
- Can I just talk to my husband, please?
- Yeah. Okay, hold on.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.202
- She wants to talk to you.
- I know.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.580
- So that's what I'm dealing with.
- Oh, my God.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.037
Yep. God bless us all.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.749
- Stop worrying.
- I'm not worried.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.960
She's very legitimate.
I found her on Craigslist.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.295
Who is it?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.505
Fantastic.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.253
Hi. It's Ethan. I called you earlier.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.300
Honestly, like two minutes, okay?
Just buy it and then go.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.514
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.724
- That was fast.
- Yeah, we were very close.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.231
I'm Ethan, this is Peter.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.734
- Are you a cop?
- Why? Are you not a licensed pharmacist?

19:03.893 --> 19:06.692
Okay, you just look really official.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.950
And you know if I ask you if you're a cop
and you are a cop, you have to say yes.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.736
That's a myth. That's actually incorrect.
But I'm not.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.702
- No, he's an architect.
- I'm an architect. So ....

19:16.864 --> 19:18.958
- Wait, it's a myth?
- Yeah.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.212
Shit! I did not know that
this whole fucking time.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.215
- That's good news.
- You're fucking scary, is what you are.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.877
- Come in. The pharmacy's in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

19:29.043 --> 19:33.389
Hey, Peter, can you watch my kids just for
five minutes, while we hen" You know.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.017
- Real quick.
- Thanks.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.610
Who are you?

19:50.147 --> 19:51.273
I'm Peter.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.738
I'm Alex. This is Patrick.

19:53.901 --> 19:58.247
Great. Alex. Mommy gave you
a boy's name.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.874
What's that supposed to mean?

20:00.241 --> 20:02.243
Alex is also a name for a boy.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.629
So your mom kind of screwed you.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.344
Sorry, my hand slipped.

20:19.009 --> 20:23.640
That one I just got in. It's an Afghan blend
of Wild Widow and AK-47.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.355
You know, I'm not crazy about blends.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.316
I find that the high is a bit shapeless.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.822
A purist. Well, that's cool.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.949
You'd probably love Northern Lights.

20:34.108 --> 20:38.830
I mean, this has got great body.
It smokes like a fucking dream.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.663
Oh, that's just Barry.
He's renting a room from me.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.169
Hey, Barry. How you doing? I'm Ethan.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.798
Listen, did you remember to TiVo
Judge Mathis?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.709
Yeah. It's on there,
if you just look at the menu.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.130
Nice perm, man. Well done.
Well done on that perm.

20:55.296 --> 20:58.095
Oh, thanks, bro.
It's not a perm, it's natural.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.510
Nobody gets perms anymore.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.687
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. Is that a perm?

21:04.472 --> 21:06.019
Yeah. It's a perm. Yeah.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.228
Oh, my God.
You didn't have your real hair.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.364
- Where do you even get those anymore?
- I know! It's like ....

21:16.025 --> 21:18.699
I was just kidding about--
This isn't a perm.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.489
- Excuse me?
- This isn't a perm. I was joking.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.242
- Oh, my God. Thank God. Because I was--
- Ha, ha!

21:24.408 --> 21:26.661
You got us. You got us both, man.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.876
You know, only, like,
fucking jerk-offs get perms.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.838
- That was good. Very good.
- That was hilarious.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.725
- Where are you from?
- Los Angeles.

21:40.883 --> 21:43.352
- Is that where you're going?
- Mm-hm.

21:43.594 --> 21:44.937
Can you take us with you?

21:47.223 --> 21:50.853
No, but there's an organization
called Child Protective Services.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.942
- What's this?
- It's a tie. You've never seen a tie before?

21:54.563 --> 21:55.610
Why do you wear it?

21:55.773 --> 21:57.195
Because I wear it.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.577
- It looks stupid.
- Well, it's not.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.079
Just take your hands off of me.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.116
Please stop doing that.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.373
Stop. Please stop doing that now.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.083
- Will you please--?
- It's Reggie.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.375
Is that right? Well, maybe Reggie
needs to take a nap.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.595
Hey, quit it. I'm not kidding.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.478
You okay, bubba?

22:34.645 --> 22:36.943
- What?
- Nothing.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.613
"Nothing" is right.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.871
And now, you come to me and you say:

22:44.029 --> 22:48.751
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

22:51.453 --> 22:55.629
But you don't even have the decency
to call me the Godfather.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.927
And you come to my house...

22:59.253 --> 23:02.348
...on the day that my daughter
is to be married...

23:02.506 --> 23:04.929
...and you ask me to kill someone.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.345
For money.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.857
But that is not justice.

23:16.979 --> 23:20.654
That's amazing.
I had chills, like, that second paragraph.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.695
When the line-- The murder.
That is so fucking good, Ethan.

23:23.861 --> 23:27.206
Thank you. I've been
working on the hand gestures to get it right.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.617
Did you write that yourself?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.660
No. The Mafia wrote it.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.707
Ch, that was so--
It was nice meeting you, anyway.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.750
Play it cool, or I'll thump you again.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.840
Sure, sure. You all set?

23:40.002 --> 23:41.174
Yeah. Good to go.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.510
How were they?
They behave themselves?

23:43.672 --> 23:46.016
Pretty much. Pretty much.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.176
- Ch, good.
- Yeah.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.345
I mean, they're great kids.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.347
We good?

23:54.058 --> 23:56.356
- See you. Good luck.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.237
Good luck with your acting stuff.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.058
--Is judging the character.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.890
When an actor is preparing a scene...

24:30.052 --> 24:33.397
...first thing is read the scene over
many times.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.560
First, before you do any work on it,
let it work on you.

24:37.726 --> 24:42.482
Read the material over and over again.
The entire script, if at all possible.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.901
Hey, Hollywood.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.740
Card's been declined.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.247
- What's that?
- Your card? It's no good.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.908
- Oh, gosh.
- It's okay.

24:52.074 --> 24:55.078
You know what? I bet I tapped it out
when I rented this car.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.588
Great. We'll pay cash.
How much you got?

24:57.746 --> 24:58.918
Sixty bucks.

24:59.415 --> 25:03.170
You have 60 bucks entirely?

25:03.585 --> 25:05.804
- Yes.
- How much did you spend on marijuana?

25:05.963 --> 25:08.341
- On your medicine?
- I don't know, around 200 bucks.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.850
- Two hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.307
Sixty bucks for gas, food,
lodging, everything?

25:12.469 --> 25:14.813
She's the only dealer in town.
She names her price.

25:14.972 --> 25:19.227
What were you thinking when you spent
almost all of our money on drugs?

25:19.393 --> 25:21.987
- I don't think in those terms.
- What terms do you think in?

25:22.146 --> 25:24.148
I'm not an accountant.
I'm not even Jewish.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.610
- Are you an adult?
- Of course I'm an adult. I'm 23 years old.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.780
You are the most shot-out
23-year-old I've ever seen.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.916
How have you made it?
How have you not run yourself over?

25:34.533 --> 25:35.580
I've done that.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.462
How have you survived?
That's my question.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.122
- Mostly luck.
- Yeah.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.087
That's what I thought.
Just dumb fucking luck.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.336
- Fuck me.
- Whoa! For heaven's sakes, Peter.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.924
- We're screwed, Ethan.
- How so?

25:47.087 --> 25:50.307
- You spent all our money on weed!
- It's just another speed bump.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.016
You know what? I'm gonna call my wife.
She's gonna wire me money. That's it.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.014
She can't. You don't have an ID.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.859
She'll wire it to you.
See? That's an adult solving a problem.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.938
- Let's go.
- I told you I was lucky.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.651
Get in the car.

26:08.984 --> 26:12.488
Hold on one second. I'm gonna go get
a brochure for my scrapbook, okay?

26:17.367 --> 26:21.543
- How do you spell the last name?
- T-R-E-M-B-L-A-Y.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.843
Here we go.
Five hundred dollars. Ethan Tremblay.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.003
I just need to see an ID.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.887
There you go.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.305
Yeah, this doesn't say Tremblay.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.644
It says Ethan Chase.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.728
Oh, jeepers Creepers.
He's right, he's right.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.521
What do you mean, "he's right"?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.860
Ethan Tremblay is my stage name.
I'm an actor.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.697
- Your stage name. What is your real name?
- Ethan Chase.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.863
- It doesn't sound like an actor's name.
- Ethan Chase does.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.202
Ethan Tremblay doesn't
make any goddamn sense.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.333
It sounds like it was made up.

26:58.492 --> 26:59.744
Yeah, I made it up.

26:59.910 --> 27:03.380
Ethan, I know you made it up.
It's your fucking stage name.

27:03.539 --> 27:06.088
Why did you have my wife wire money
to your stage name?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.877
- I wasn't thinking.
- Right.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.592
Just trying to commit to the new name.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.724
Do you guys wanna discuss this,
perhaps out in the parking lot?

27:13.882 --> 27:16.601
One sec. Do you have anything else
with your name on it?

27:19.012 --> 27:20.559
- Yes. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Good.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.894
What was I thinking?

27:22.558 --> 27:25.562
- He has two names.
- That's fantastic.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.821
But one sec.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.532
- What the fuck is this?
- It's an ID.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.367
It's a photo ID.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.497
- No, I can't accept this either.
- Why?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.751
Because it's a picture of yourself.
Anyone could take a picture...

27:40.909 --> 27:43.753
...in a beautiful turtleneck,
put whatever name they want.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.086
But why go to all that trouble
just for 500 bucks?

27:47.249 --> 27:49.217
I don't know why you would,
but you could.

27:49.376 --> 27:53.381
So I get to call my pregnant wife and have
her drive all the way to Western Union.

27:53.547 --> 27:57.051
Start this whole process all over again,
send it to the correct name...

27:57.217 --> 27:58.264
...and we'll be good.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.225
- Absolutely.
- Great.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.106
We'll have to do that tomorrow.
We close in five minutes.

28:03.265 --> 28:05.267
It's 6:35, sir.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.436
What are you, my boss?
You make the hours?

28:07.603 --> 28:11.449
I say when we close. I got reservations
at Chili's. I'm meeting my boys.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.076
- You have a reservation at Chili's?
- Mm-hm.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.577
That's actually smart. I mean,
it gets busy on a Wednesday night.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.742
Are you gonna stare at me?

28:21.909 --> 28:24.628
Do your fucking job
until your shift is over, hillbilly.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.414
- Keep dreaming, faggot. No way in hell.
- Oh, really?

28:27.581 --> 28:30.255
Excuse me, Peter. Sir.

28:32.002 --> 28:35.802
I'm sorry about my friend. We really just
need the money to get to Los Angeles...

28:35.964 --> 28:38.467
...so he can be there
for the birth of his first child.

28:39.009 --> 28:42.479
That's such a sweet story. You know
where I was when my daughter was born?

28:42.638 --> 28:44.811
- Chili's?
- Iraq.

28:45.015 --> 28:49.020
How about I call my sergeant in Fallujah
and tell him your story, see what he thinks?

28:49.186 --> 28:51.860
Aren't you closing?
Is it gonna take a long time?

28:52.022 --> 28:54.696
He's being sarcastic, Ethan,
and also letting us know...

28:54.858 --> 28:57.202
...that he's a "battle-hardened" veteran...

28:57.361 --> 29:00.365
...who did some half-assed tour
and talks about it all the time.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.032
How dare you.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.873
- Smooth move, that.
- You're sick.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.497
You fucked up. Bigtime.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.173
- I fucked up?
- Yeah.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.883
I fucked up bigtime?

29:12.042 --> 29:14.170
You spit on your own window.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.847
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, sport?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.684
What were you saying about
my half-assed tour of duty?

29:21.843 --> 29:24.392
- I'm sorry. I had no idea.
- No idea what?

29:24.554 --> 29:26.056
- I'm handicapable?
- Handicapable.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.976
- How could you know?
- I couldn't know, and I'm sorry.

29:29.518 --> 29:33.318
Can I tell you something? Honestly,
it's my fault. I'm just having a bad day.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.732
- You had a bad day?
- Yeah.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.151
It's about to get a whole lot worse.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.490
- Okay, now put that away before you--
- Help!

29:40.570 --> 29:42.163
Oh, I know that shit hurt, huh?

29:42.322 --> 29:43.699
- Ah. Fucking hick.
- Oh, God.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.037
The kid's got moves.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.874
You wanna fuck up my dinner plans,
I'll fuck you up.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.339
I call that little move "the wheelbarrow."

29:51.581 --> 29:54.050
- Peter, get up, get up.
- Come on. Come on.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.057
- Courtesy of Western Union, huh?
- Hold on one second.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.723
- Oh, where you going, huh?
- Call the cops.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.516
Fuck the cops.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.931
Here comes the train.
Choo-Choo!

30:11.727 --> 30:14.571
It's closing time

30:14.730 --> 30:16.232
Time to roll to Chili's

30:16.398 --> 30:19.777
And chow down with my fuckin' boys

30:39.588 --> 30:40.589
You okay, buddy?

30:40.756 --> 30:44.761
Don't call me that. Buddies have each
ether's backs when an assault takes place.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.519
Peter, that man was handicapped.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.932
You can call me Peter. Or Mr. Highman.

30:50.098 --> 30:54.194
I'll call you Mr. Chase.
Unless that was a fake ID too.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.283
Why you have a stage name is beyond me.
You're not really an actor.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.321
What does that mean, "really an actor"'?
What is a real actor?

31:03.487 --> 31:05.615
A real actor is someone
who can really act.

31:05.781 --> 31:08.455
Well, go ahead, give me an action to do.
Give me a scene.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.369
- No. I don't want to.
- You should.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.542
Okay. I'm Julia Roberts.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.672
You have terminal cancer.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.754
We're engaged.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.342
Break the news to me.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.047
Julia Roberts...

31:22.214 --> 31:24.558
...as you know, we're engaged.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.807
I have terminal cancer.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.185
Awful.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.225
- What?
- Sorry, that's my feedback.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.394
- I thought that was really good.
- Nope.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.905
I'll give you one more shot.
It's Super Bowl Sunday.

31:39.189 --> 31:41.487
You're a coach with a spotty career.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.199
You're down 31 points.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.580
Bust into the locker room
and fire the guys up.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.536
All or nothing. Action.

31:48.698 --> 31:52.328
- Stupid. That would never be in a movie.
- It's in a movie every two years.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.913
Every two years.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.513
Okay, guys, we need to get out there.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.926
Really need to get going.
Pollard, what are you doing?

32:07.092 --> 32:10.722
You're acting like a girl out there.
What are you, a girl or something?

32:12.055 --> 32:15.059
Jackson, come on, man,
you gotta get yourself together.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.946
- What are you, a girl or something?
- Let's up the stakes. Your wife calls.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.356
She wants a divorce.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.859
- The coach's wife?
- The coach you're playing.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.995
His wife calls. She wants a divorce.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.910
Ring-ring.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.451
Hello?

32:33.743 --> 32:38.715
Hey, fellas, it's gonna be a minute.
It's my wife. She wants a divorce.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.171
Hey, sweetheart.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.886
What's that?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.305
No, don't--

32:50.385 --> 32:52.433
This is not a good time.

33:06.902 --> 33:11.123
Because I lost my dad,
I don't want you to leave me right now.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.464
I don't wanna be left alone.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.423
I miss him so much.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.137
You can't do this.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.128
I got soda. I got water.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.213
Okay. Great.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.630
Thank you.

34:10.507 --> 34:13.260
- Crazy rain.
- Nuts.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.273
I think we're done for today.
We'll sleep in the car.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.317
Okay.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.525
We'll kill it tomorrow. But this is ....

34:32.529 --> 34:35.533
So tell me something about your dad.
What did he do for a living?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.496
He was a toll-booth operator.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.751
Really?

34:38.909 --> 34:42.210
He was a real people person.
He loved his job.

34:42.371 --> 34:46.092
He'd come home every night and he'd laugh
about how long his line was.

34:46.251 --> 34:49.846
Because he enjoyed talking to everybody
that went through the toll booth.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.848
Oh.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.598
What about you? Where's your dad?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.478
Uh ....

34:58.597 --> 35:00.190
No idea.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.860
When's the last time you saw him?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.854
1977.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.651
Ooh.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.566
Ouch.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.496
Yep. Came into my room, said,
"Petey, I got an important job for you.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.954
I need you to wake me up,
5:30 tomorrow morning."

35:18.366 --> 35:22.746
And I was ecstatic because
he never asked me to do anything.

35:22.912 --> 35:27.964
I didn't even know I existed
in his eyes. So ....

35:28.418 --> 35:30.716
It was just a big deal. I was so excited.

35:30.879 --> 35:35.134
I set the alarm clock. I could barely sleep.
I just watched it all night.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.099
When it went off at 5:30,
I snuck into his room...

35:38.762 --> 35:41.140
...I gingerly wake him up.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.897
He smiled at me.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.062
First time I ever saw him...

35:52.025 --> 35:54.824
...uh, smile.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.160
But he had his bags packed
by the front door...

35:58.323 --> 36:01.372
...and he picked them up,
put them in the back of his car...

36:02.619 --> 36:04.747
...and drove away.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.878
Last time I ever saw him.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.805
It's so funny.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.104
Oh, my gosh.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.107
My dad would never do that.
He loved me.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.375
What's that sound?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.295
What sound?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.756
Mm.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.966
No, it stopped.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.344
- Okay, it's back.
- That's me. I'm just masturbating.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.057
What? Why?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.972
This is how I go to sleep.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.062
Oh, don't, don't, don't. Come on, dude.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.897
I'm right here next to you.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.857
Just shut your eyes, Peter.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.989
They're closed. The sound.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.320
Just bear with me.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.491
- How long is this gonna take?
- Ugh!

37:19.988 --> 37:23.037
If you keep interrupting me
it's gonna take a little longer...

37:23.199 --> 37:25.327
...but it usually just takes
about 35 minutes.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.040
Is that all?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.179
Your fucking dog's doing it too.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.848
Sonny! Stop!

37:44.888 --> 37:47.516
Sonny, no. Stop.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.443
Good boy.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.085
I

38:41.236 --> 38:43.238
Come here, garbage face. Come here.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.232
Don't even think about it.
Had to be done.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.192
Please. Don't.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.448
Intolerable. Intolerable.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.204
Son of a bitch.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.465
Goddamn it. No.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.349
Great. This is great.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.010
Fuck.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.804
Don't.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.149
Okay.

39:53.975 --> 39:57.070
We are gathered in the presence
of the Lord and all things holy...

39:57.228 --> 40:01.699
...to celebrate the passing of one Mr.--
I don't remember his fucking name.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.862
Chase. Or a.k.a. Tremblay.

40:05.236 --> 40:10.333
May he forever reside and dwell
in the sunlight of the spirit.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.995
Amen.

40:15.705 --> 40:19.005
You know, I just wanna offer
an explanation, sir...

40:19.167 --> 40:21.920
...as to why you wound up
on the side of Interstate 20.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.839
It's not your fault. It's your kid.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.260
He's an incredibly difficult person
to travel with.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.270
In fact, I don't know how or why...

40:31.429 --> 40:34.854
...you didn't just strangle him
in the fucking Crib.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.885
Hey, buddy.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.473
Forget something?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.225
No. I got ....

41:13.388 --> 41:15.140
I got coffee.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.438
Dunkin' Donuts.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.977
Thought maybe you left me.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.147
I picked up breakfast
so we can eat on the road, make up time.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.446
- Why'd you leave my stuff out here?
- It's your property.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.409
- That makes sense.
- Yep.

41:31.906 --> 41:32.907
Want me to drive?

41:33.074 --> 41:35.247
- It is your shift.
- Okay. Very good.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.333
I'll grab the other items.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.622
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:39.789 --> 41:40.836
Come on, Sonny.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.751
Sonny, come on.

41:43.418 --> 41:46.922
I was thinking, "There's no way
that Peter would have left me here.

41:47.255 --> 41:50.475
We've had our bumps in the road,
but he's not gonna leave me."

41:50.633 --> 41:54.433
- Oh, please, no. It's not my car.
- Right.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.643
Yeah. Come on. Get in, Sonny.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.360
You know, my mind works
in mysterious ways.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.022
And I thought, "God, why would
he wanna travel alone, you know?"

42:04.188 --> 42:05.440
You have a nice shower?

42:05.606 --> 42:06.653
- Yes, excellent.
- Great.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.285
You know, rest areas
have the nicest showers.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.697
The nicest showers.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.418
This coffee's hot.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.541
- It's hot coffee.
- Whoo!

42:25.460 --> 42:28.054
- Have we crossed the Mississippi River?
- We're in Texas.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.387
The Mississippi River was the river
we crossed in Mississippi.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.135
That's too bad.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.725
Would have been a great sendoff
for my papa.

42:36.888 --> 42:41.860
Put his ashes in the old river. Let the ashes
float down to New Orleans, you know?

42:42.185 --> 42:44.233
Spend Mardi Gras there.

42:44.395 --> 42:48.320
- I'm gonna get some shuteye, okay?
- Nothing he loved more than jazz music...

42:48.900 --> 42:50.493
...and women's titties.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.249
- Did I snore last night?
- Mm-hm.

42:56.574 --> 43:00.044
Sorry. I'm a deep sleeper.
It's a condition.

43:00.203 --> 43:03.548
You know when they say, "That guy
could sleep through an earthquake"?

43:03.706 --> 43:05.674
I've actually slept
through an earthquake.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.887
I also fell asleep during a job interview
at Bank of America.

43:09.045 --> 43:12.174
I didn't sleep last night.
I'm gonna try now.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.717
You should have masturbated...

43:13.883 --> 43:16.682
...because I had a glorious orgasm
and I slept like a baby.

43:56.217 --> 43:58.060
- Of a gentle coast

43:58.302 --> 44:01.806
And a sun to maybe dissipate

44:02.390 --> 44:06.520
Shadows of the mess you made

44:18.906 --> 44:20.954
Hey! Get up!

44:21.951 --> 44:23.919
Ethan, wake up! Goddamn it!

44:25.121 --> 44:26.464
Son of a bitch.

44:27.415 --> 44:28.587
NO!

44:51.689 --> 44:53.441
I can't feel my arm.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.876
What happened?

45:06.579 --> 45:09.458
I'll see if the rental agreement's in the ....

45:13.336 --> 45:15.680
You know what? I have coverage.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.215
That's good.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.190
- Stay away from me.
- Jeez Louise, are you okay?

45:26.349 --> 45:28.568
Am I okay? Do I look okay?

45:28.726 --> 45:30.820
I have a broken arm, three cracked ribs.

45:30.978 --> 45:34.323
I have seven stitches in my armpit.
Does that answer your question?

45:34.649 --> 45:36.993
No, not okay.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.488
- Peter, I am terribly sorry.
- Are you?

45:39.654 --> 45:42.658
Sonny's all banged up. I'm a wreck.
You don't have a scratch.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.497
Doctor said I was in such a deep sleep
I didn't tense up.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.503
- I told you I was a deep sleeper.
- Yeah.

45:47.662 --> 45:51.087
Did the doctor say it is not advisable
to fall asleep while driving?

45:51.249 --> 45:53.752
I was just trying to rest my eyes
for a few seconds.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.387
But seriously, next time
try not to tense up. Really.

45:58.381 --> 46:00.383
- One sec.
- Who's that?

46:00.549 --> 46:03.849
My actual friend. He's come to pick me up.
All the way from Dallas.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.855
- Oh, good. Shotgun.
- Nope. Not us.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.857
Just me. We're done.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.360
And by the way,
it's been a fucking pleasure.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.864
But just so my conscience is clear,
let me let you know...

46:15.022 --> 46:17.571
...why you're not coming with us, okay?

46:17.733 --> 46:21.533
It's not because you got me kicked off
a plane and shot by an air marshal.

46:21.696 --> 46:26.543
Not because you stood by as I had my ass
handed to me by a handicapped hillbilly.

46:26.701 --> 46:28.578
I am certainly not leaving you here...

46:28.744 --> 46:32.590
...because you almost got me killed
during the most important week of my life.

46:32.748 --> 46:35.877
I am leaving you here
for a far more fundamental reason:

46:36.043 --> 46:39.092
I despise who you are at a cellular level.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.758
I've heard that before,
and I'm trying to work on it.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.471
- Yes.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.888
Beware. I'm warning you,
don't go to Hollywood.

46:47.054 --> 46:50.399
The streets are not paved with gold.
They are paved with the carcasses...

46:50.558 --> 46:53.402
...of imbeciles like you
who think they're gonna make it.

46:53.561 --> 46:55.108
"Pray you, avoid it."

46:55.271 --> 46:58.115
Did you get that? That was Shakespeare.
Heard of him?

46:58.274 --> 47:00.652
Yes, I've heard of him.
He's a famous pirate.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.820
And by the way, it's Shakesbeard.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.740
Let me give you a little bit
of friendly advice.

47:06.073 --> 47:11.876
Nobody who calls themselves "Hollywood"
has ever made it in Hollywood.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.132
That I've never heard before.

47:15.291 --> 47:19.262
Sonny, you will be sorely missed,
you little bat-faced piece of shit.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.726
- I have never...
- Well, get used to it.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.603
...in all of my 23 years!

47:32.641 --> 47:34.860
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What the fuck?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.771
- We're moving out.
- You all right?

47:36.937 --> 47:38.655
- What's going on?
- Thank you so much.

47:38.814 --> 47:40.612
Who's the dude you yelling at?

47:40.775 --> 47:43.494
He's nobody. A guy I was traveling with.
He's trouble.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.869
He looks sad as shit.

47:47.656 --> 47:50.705
- And you just spit on his dog.
- I spit on his d-- God, I did.

47:50.868 --> 47:54.873
I was seeing red because he has a way of
getting under your skin. I'm fine. Let's go.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.837
- You wanna leave him here?
- Trust me.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.343
- Pete, how long have I known you?
- Twenty years.

47:59.502 --> 48:00.549
- Twenty years.
- Yep.

48:00.711 --> 48:04.557
Your energy's off. You don't wanna mess
your karma up. You have a child coming.

48:04.715 --> 48:08.515
So whatever you need to do to fix between
you and DeBarge, you need to fix it.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.185
Trust me.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.731
Make it right.

48:21.816 --> 48:24.365
Hollywood, come here.

48:30.366 --> 48:32.664
- You see what I'm working with here?
- Oh, wow.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.338
Okay, I've calmed down a bit.

48:36.497 --> 48:38.545
- You ready to apologize?
- What? Fuck you!

48:38.707 --> 48:39.959
- Wait. Oh, no.
- Let's go.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.254
Pete, Pete, relax.

48:42.503 --> 48:43.675
Fix it.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.182
First of all,
I'm sorry that I spat on Sonny.

48:46.340 --> 48:48.342
I have no recollection
of that whatsoever.

48:48.509 --> 48:51.353
Now, if you're gonna travel
with me to Los Angeles...

48:51.512 --> 48:54.015
...I gotta give you a couple guidelines.
Number one:

48:54.181 --> 48:58.186
If you ask me a single question,
I'm going to flip out on you.

48:58.352 --> 49:01.447
- So don't do that. Do you understand?
- Somewhat, yes.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.734
If you fall asleep for any reason...

49:04.900 --> 49:07.904
...other than the fact that
you're in a bed and it's nighttime...

49:08.070 --> 49:09.447
...I will disembowel you.

49:09.613 --> 49:10.785
Make sense?

49:10.948 --> 49:12.074
- Somewhat.
- Great.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.586
If you're allergic to waffles,
don't eat waffles.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.372
- Then don't take me to a Waffle House.
- Shut up!

49:18.539 --> 49:20.587
- Relax.
- Get your stuff and get in back.

49:20.749 --> 49:22.092
- Hold Sonny.
- Nope.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.219
Hand me that dog, I will rip it in half.

49:25.880 --> 49:29.134
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.614
And then, his fault,
we're both put on a No-Fly list.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.778
- A No-Fly list? You?
- Yeah, and it just--

49:49.945 --> 49:54.951
Yeah. Just got worse from there.
Because he's pathological, I think.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.994
He'll just start beating off.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.253
- What?
- Yes.

49:58.412 --> 50:01.461
- No lotion?
- No, no, he was dry-docking.

50:04.084 --> 50:06.007
Is that a drainage ditch coming up?

50:08.047 --> 50:09.094
Yes, it is.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.803
- Would you mind?
- I'm hitting it.

50:10.966 --> 50:14.140
Real hard.

50:20.476 --> 50:21.523
Ethan, you all right?

50:22.770 --> 50:23.817
Yeah, we're good.

50:23.979 --> 50:27.779
Next time, don't tense up your body.
Just stay loose.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.614
- There's another one up here too.
- Want to hit him again?

50:45.543 --> 50:47.341
We can't take your Range Rover, D.

50:47.503 --> 50:49.380
Yes, you can. I prefer my pickup anyway.

50:49.547 --> 50:53.518
- I'll ship it back as soon as I get there.
- No need. I'll be in L.A. on Friday.

50:53.676 --> 50:55.644
You will? What are you doing in L.A.?

50:55.803 --> 50:57.851
I'm not gonna miss
the birth of your baby.

50:58.013 --> 51:01.688
Doesn't it burn you up
that she's getting a C-section?

51:01.850 --> 51:05.571
I mean, that body was so flawless,
just banging.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.322
How did you know we were
getting a C-section?

51:07.481 --> 51:09.483
She told me. Coffee?

51:09.858 --> 51:11.326
Sure.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.584
What is going on?

51:19.034 --> 51:20.502
What are you talking about?

51:20.661 --> 51:23.210
What's with all these stories
he has about your wife?

51:23.372 --> 51:24.874
They used to date in college?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.508
It was like 20 years ago.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.385
Yeah, but come on, you don't see it?

51:28.669 --> 51:31.673
This guy's good-looking.
He's a football player. He's charming.

51:31.839 --> 51:35.264
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- He has beautiful hands.

51:36.051 --> 51:37.803
I think there's something going on.

51:37.970 --> 51:40.519
- Here you go.
- What's this picture from?

51:40.681 --> 51:42.854
- What's that?
- This picture of you and Sarah.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.861
Oh, yeah, that was February.
We was in San Diego.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.192
She didn't tell you?

51:47.354 --> 51:50.699
She mentioned that she bumped into you.
She didn't say that--

51:50.858 --> 51:54.078
That we were throwing them back.
Getting wasted, having a good time.

51:54.236 --> 51:56.705
Just sort of reliving some things,
you know, just ....

51:56.864 --> 51:59.458
- Real good girl. Fantastic.
- She is. Slipped her mind.

51:59.617 --> 52:02.712
February. Isn't that about
nine months ago?

52:03.912 --> 52:06.085
- No questions.
- Nine, 10 months.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.925
Nine.

52:09.251 --> 52:12.846
Where you at with the names?
She said you were being a real hard-ass.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.554
- She said that?
- Yeah, she hit me in a e-mail.

52:15.716 --> 52:18.469
- You and his wife exchange e-mails?
- Yeah.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.263
What else do you exchange?

52:20.429 --> 52:22.227
- Ethan.
- Body fluids?

52:22.973 --> 52:25.817
- What is he talking about?
- I don't even listen to him.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.070
This is not bothering you? The e-mails--

52:28.228 --> 52:29.571
Each ether's ejaculate?

52:29.897 --> 52:30.898
What?

52:31.065 --> 52:32.612
It's when your urine turns white.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.244
Okay, new rule: You can't...

52:36.904 --> 52:38.872
...say a fucking word.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.079
This is horrible. It tastes like cat litter.

52:41.241 --> 52:42.663
I think it tastes delicious.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.705
You should. I was all out,
so I used the coffee you brought.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.464
Oh, boy.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.253
That's his dad, it's his dad.

52:49.416 --> 52:53.262
Fine. I'll buy some other coffee.
I apologize. What's the big deal?

52:53.420 --> 52:54.592
His dad is the coffee.

52:54.755 --> 52:57.975
He passed away and his remains
were in the fucking can.

52:58.425 --> 53:01.554
Get him the fuck out.
The beard, the dog, get him out!

53:01.720 --> 53:03.142
- I get it.
- Get him out!

53:03.305 --> 53:05.023
I know. It took eight minutes, right?

53:10.646 --> 53:13.490
Oh, God! So stupid!

53:18.946 --> 53:21.199
Where are the ashes?
Where are my dad's ashes?

53:21.365 --> 53:22.662
Relax.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.619
- It was an accident.
- Where is it?

53:24.785 --> 53:26.332
- Where?
- Right where I'm pointing.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.543
There's the coffee machine right there.

53:28.706 --> 53:31.459
There's the can, there's the Coffeemaker.

53:31.625 --> 53:35.675
We're gonna retrieve this.
I got it, I got it. Slow down, it's okay.

53:35.838 --> 53:37.340
Can we just calm down?

53:38.465 --> 53:40.058
Let me take it.

53:40.384 --> 53:41.727
Oh, God.

53:41.885 --> 53:42.977
Will you relax?

53:43.137 --> 53:44.480
Oh!

53:52.646 --> 53:54.148
It's okay.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.908
Come here, I'll help you pick it up.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.326
There we go.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.333
Get it back in there.

54:42.571 --> 54:44.039
I'm sorry we drank your father.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.331
It's okay.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.705
Are you all right? Are you sure?

54:51.872 --> 54:54.591
Yeah, there's plenty of him still in here.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.052
Darryl only made three cups of coffee...

54:57.211 --> 55:00.761
...and I think there's about eight cups
of my dad left in here.

55:00.923 --> 55:02.175
Great.

55:06.887 --> 55:08.264
At least he tasted good.

55:08.555 --> 55:09.977
Not bad.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.733
Yeah, strong.

55:11.892 --> 55:14.896
He was full-flavored.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.899
Robust blend.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.239
He really enjoyed coffee.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.406
And in the end,
he was enjoyed as coffee.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.249
Kind of circle of life.

55:28.575 --> 55:30.577
Lion King. All that.

55:33.789 --> 55:37.919
I'll tell you what, the moratorium on
asking questions is officially lifted.

55:38.418 --> 55:39.920
Fire away.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.717
Okay.

55:43.674 --> 55:44.926
- How's your arm?
- Not bad.

55:45.092 --> 55:47.436
Do you think Darryl slept with your wife?

55:48.011 --> 55:50.264
- No.
- I do.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.104
I mean, why would he lend you
this very fancy car...

55:53.267 --> 55:56.111
...and give you all that
walking-around money? It's ....

55:56.270 --> 55:57.943
Because he's my friend.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.940
That's why.

56:00.482 --> 56:02.780
Have you ever been
to the San Diego Zoo?

56:02.943 --> 56:04.616
I have a question for you.

56:04.778 --> 56:07.622
How did those three questions
come into your head?

56:08.282 --> 56:11.957
I was thinking about your wife and Darryl,
Darryl getting your wife pregnant.

56:12.119 --> 56:15.123
What their baby would look like,
maybe like a zebra baby.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.133
Then I thought,
"Well, I've never seen a zebra."

56:18.292 --> 56:21.466
And I thought, "Well, I should maybe
go to the San Diego Zoo...

56:21.628 --> 56:24.723
- ...when we get to California--"
- Nope, I've never been to the zoo.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.555
Next question, please.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.931
Hey, hon.

56:29.136 --> 56:33.357
It's your ever-faithful and adoring husband
calling from West Texas.

56:33.515 --> 56:34.562
Just checking in.

56:34.725 --> 56:38.355
Weird, it went to voicemail.
Are you on the other line with Darryl?

56:40.230 --> 56:41.982
I actually talked to him...

56:42.482 --> 56:45.861
...and he told me about the lovely weekend
you guys spent in San Diego.

56:46.028 --> 56:48.076
Didn't jibe with the way
you recounted it...

56:48.238 --> 56:50.991
...so maybe with all your e-mails
and phone calls...

56:51.158 --> 56:52.910
...you can get your story straight.

56:55.537 --> 56:58.837
If there's something you need to tell me
before we go down this road...

56:58.999 --> 57:01.548
...if I'm gonna have a surprise
in the delivery room...

57:01.710 --> 57:05.055
...I would just appreciate it
that you erase any and all--

57:05.213 --> 57:06.681
Call me.

57:08.759 --> 57:11.512
- Was I right or was I wrong?
- About what?

57:12.346 --> 57:15.190
The Darryl thing, your wife,
and the mystery about the baby.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.226
She's sleeping. I left a message.

57:18.101 --> 57:22.607
And the casual manner with which you
bring up this topic, it makes me edgy.

57:23.398 --> 57:26.993
So if you wouldn't mind not doing that
anymore I'd really appreciate it.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.078
- I got some snacks.
- Yes, I see.

57:29.237 --> 57:31.911
Unfortunately, I need you to drive.
I'm on Vicodin.

57:32.074 --> 57:34.918
I'm not supposed to operate
heavy machinery.

57:35.577 --> 57:36.874
I will tell you this:

57:37.037 --> 57:40.758
If you blink, if you even look like you
might be dozing, let alone fall asleep...

57:40.916 --> 57:45.262
...I'm gonna put hands on you. I'm gonna
choke you out with your own scarf.

57:45.420 --> 57:49.550
Wrap that thing around your neck
and choke you the fuck out. Promise.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.144
Seems a bit drastic.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.600
Take off your glasses.

57:54.763 --> 57:56.686
I bought them,
I wanted to showcase them.

57:56.848 --> 57:58.270
It's night. You're driving.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.937
You act like you've never been
in a fender-bender.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.481
- Remove them.
- Okay.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.909
- Jolt Cola? Drink it.
- Yeah.

58:08.068 --> 58:11.743
- You're not the boss of me, you know.
- I know. Just drink it.

58:12.614 --> 58:13.991
Please.

58:19.579 --> 58:20.922
Attaboy.

58:26.753 --> 58:28.755
By the way, when I fell asleep...

58:28.922 --> 58:30.924
...that was a one-time occurrence.

58:31.425 --> 58:35.100
- I know what I'm doing. I'm a grown man.
- Did you remember to use the restroom?

58:35.262 --> 58:36.684
Oh.

58:53.905 --> 58:57.660
Hey you, out there on your own

58:57.826 --> 58:59.954
Sitting naked by the phone

59:00.120 --> 59:02.168
Would you touch me?

59:04.583 --> 59:08.383
Hey you, with your ear against the wall

59:08.754 --> 59:12.554
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?

59:16.303 --> 59:22.686
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?

59:26.480 --> 59:30.986
Open your heart, I'm coming home

59:37.991 --> 59:40.039
This is some stuff.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.000
This window is not working.

59:46.208 --> 59:50.088
No, I locked them so we could get
a good clambake going on in here.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.343
That way, Sonny could get stoned.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.015
Am I stoned?

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.347
Do you feel stoned?

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.746
But it was only fantasy

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:24.792
No matter how he tried
He could not break free

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.508
And the worms ate into his brain

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:45.939
Hey you
Don 't tell me there 's no hope at all

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.732
Together we stand

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.402
Divided we fall

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.502
Then what? How did it resolve?

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:09.045
Well, it turns out the cheese grater
was underneath the mattress.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:14.513
Ha, ha!
That is so sophisticated. And has heart.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:15.763
The show has heart.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.267
How do you know so much about this?

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:22.646
I run a fan site for the show. Not official,
but I've run a fan site for about six years.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.973
I started it at an internet café.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.517
Used to go in there and wash my feet.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:28.856
What was the site called?

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.567
It'sRainingTwoAndAHalfMen.com.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:33.944
Wow.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:38.196
That is sublime. Can I retract every
derogatory statement I've made about you?

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.831
Thank you, Peter. That's very sweet.

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.287
- Hand me a Bugle.
- Sure.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.499
Thank you.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.789
- Will you feed one to the hound?
- Very well.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.963
Are we on the highway still?

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.177
Relax, Peter, I've got it covered.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.512
Are you certain?

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.644
You're getting paranoid.
That pot got to you.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.973
Okay. All right, you see the flag?

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:09.230
It looks like a border crossing,
it says "Mexico"--

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.316
- Oh, Lord. Gosh.
- What?

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.323
I thought that said Texaco.
We're low on gas.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.325
- Okay, we're fine.
- Yep.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.031
We're good. We're good.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.662
What are you gonna tell them?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.164
All I'm gonna do is say,
"Look, we made a mistake."

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.076
- And we're gonna ask to turn around.
- Perfect.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:30.710
Okay, I need you to be quiet.
Sit straight. Don't say anything.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:33.500
Won't that be suspicious
if they ask me a question?

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.669
- Let me handle everything.
- You handle it.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.008
- Here we go.
- Uh-oh. He's looking right at me.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.515
Peter, please be quiet, okay?

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.511
I'm sorry.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:48.099
Hello. The weirdest thing happened.
We just kind of got shifted--

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.518
Are you guys American citizens?

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.061
Yes. Yes, we are.

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:54.025
- The both of you?
- Yes, absolutely.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.189
Can I see your passports?

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:57.699
We don't have passports.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.573
The thing is,
we didn't mean to end up here.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:05.286
Somehow, I must have taken
the wrong exit, and we're here, so ....

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.122
If we could just maybe turn around
and go back?

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:10.249
You wanna turn around?

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:12.915
Yeah, it was a mistake.
We're trying to get back--

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:16.001
What's wrong with your friend?

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:18.591
Peter, don't do that.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:21.723
Why are your eyes so glassy?
You been partying?

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.717
No, I have glaucoma.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:27.433
What about your friend,
does he have glaucoma too?

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:32.062
Answer the man. Do you have glaucoma?
No, he doesn't have glaucoma.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.819
What about the dog,
does he have glaucoma?

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:37.901
Because his eyes are glassy as fuck.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.868
Shut off the car.
Give me the keys, please.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.907
Wait right here.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.296
- Did I blow it?
- No, we're fine.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.419
You are smooth.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:57.842
- Wow.
- Hand me Sonny, please.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.756
God, my heart was in my throat.
I was flipping out.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:06.510
Could you hand me my father's ashes?
They're on the floorboard.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.764
Wow. What's--? What are you doing?

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.622
We took the wrong exit,
we wound up here by mistake.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.409
No matter how many times you ask,
that's my answer.

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:32.623
You sound like Jason Bourne, man.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.380
You don't know where you're going.
No ID.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.167
I wanna speak to
the American consulate.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.676
I'm American, I have rights.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.461
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.802
Hey, Ramon.
He wants to talk to his consulate.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:52.063
Hello, sir.
Welcome to the American consulate.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.520
- How can I help you?
- That's unacceptable.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:01.156
What are you laughing about?
This is a serious matter. I have rights.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.316
You americanos sneak into our country.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.494
You bring drugs, you party.
You sleep with our women.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:09.076
I've never heard of an American
sneaking into Mexico.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.867
This would be an isolated incident.
It's usually the reverse.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.541
I'm getting tired of your cavalier attitude.

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:17.546
Well, I apologize. I'm sorry.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:21.335
You attempted to transport drugs
across an international border...

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.257
...dude.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.635
This is serious shit.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.425
Okay, Daddy.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.840
There.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.657
Shit!

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:41.630
Son of a bitch!

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.093
Stop!

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:58.644
Help!

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.147
Oh, shoot.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.085
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.263
Pull the car over!

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.058
Hold on, Sonny, it's about to get rough.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.650
Oh, God.

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:14.886
Ethan?

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.014
Hollywood!

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.827
Oh, crud.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.411
Peter? Peter, are you okay?

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.091
How many laws did we just break?

01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:55.426
I don't know, 60?

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.051
I had no idea where I was going.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.845
Then I see you. Remember,
when we jackknifed together?

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.356
- But you didn't look like you.
- We locked eyes.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.358
- God, you looked crazy!
- Yeah. Well, I'm in stealth mode.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.737
- That's why I got the scarf on my head.
- You were like a commando.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.738
- You were a Comanche warrior.
- Thanks.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.899
- It was the greatest ever.
- Thank you.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.319
Don't move. Ready?

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.825
What? Oh.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.332
That's your new headshot.
Ha-ha-ha!

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.203
- Yeah.
- How could it not be?

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.584
God, the pain is extraordinary.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.630
- Will you e-mail that to me, please?
- Yeah.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.054
Okay. All right. Just not too much, Peter.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:39.263
Rescue. A daring rescue.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:42.060
- You came back for me.
- Of course I did.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.642
You're so brave.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.479
I made you a promise.
I told you I was gonna get you home.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.393
I'm getting you home safe, okay?

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:51.441
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- What?

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.106
- I'm gonna give you a smooch.
- No.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.444
- Come on, baby.
- No way!

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.781
- Give me a little smooch.
- Stop, Peter! I'm driving! Oh!

01:09:58.444 --> 01:09:59.661
Sick!

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.073
You got it.

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:04.584
- Everything's up and down with you.
- I owe you bigtime.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.961
No way I'd see my kid
if you hadn't done that.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:08.955
There's no way.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.965
I love you, dude.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.969
I love you too, Peter.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.809
Oh, dear.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:34.315
Sweetheart, I am so sorry.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.485
You know how I get.
I've always been jealous. It's ....

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:41.325
You knew about that.
I told you I ran into him there.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:45.833
I know, and I know it has nothing to do
with you. It's just my shit. It's my shit.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.996
Just listen to me, okay? Don't say anything.
Just listen to me.

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:52.166
I would never betray you,
Peter, you know that.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.759
We're a family now.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.336
Nothing else matters.
Do you understand?

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:02.551
- You're so right.
- Can you just get home safely, please?

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.644
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.871
Wake up. Ethan.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.332
Check it out.

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:54.606
I'm telling you, I wouldn't make it up.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:57.067
You sure? I could've sworn
I read it was man-made.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:00.404
Nope. Not correct. Very old.
Formed over time.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:03.194
Grand Canyon. Known fact.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.035
Peter, I have a photogenic memory.
I have recall for--

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:11.078
Ethan, I promise you. It's old. It's the
Grand Canyon, it's not the Hoover Dam.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.839
Well, I know it's not the Hoover Dam,
that was built by the Pilgrims.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.916
Also incorrect.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.256
It's magnificent though.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:23.848
- You didn't have to stop, you know.
- That's okay. It's the perfect place.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.301
Let's hit the road.
I can do that any time.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:30.221
We've got time.
We don't have to be in L.A. till morning.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:31.765
What are you doing? Relax.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.980
We should just stick with the plan,
you know?

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:37.565
But I thought this was part of the plan.

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.650
What am I missing, Ethan?

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.693
What's really going on?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.739
When I said the Grand Canyon
wasn't on the way, you said:

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.906
"Too bad, it would've been perfect."

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:51.292
When we passed
the Mississippi River you said:

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.202
"Too bad, Dad loved titties and jazz."

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:57.624
I just-- You know, we got stuff to do
and I don't wanna step on it.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.758
I know it's hard to say goodbye.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:04.343
And I didn't know your dad, but from what
you've told me he was a great father.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:06.716
He was a cool guy.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.557
I'm just saying.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.846
I'm just suggesting.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.314
If you got it in you...

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.528
...he deserves a grand gesture.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.074
Okay.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.879
Come on, Sonny.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.177
Come here, sweetheart. Yeah.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:02.021
Dad, you were like a father to me.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.069
And...

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.655
...I don't know how
I'm gonna make it without you.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:20.044
But I know that you'll look after me
from up there.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.588
I'm gonna make you proud, Dad.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.681
Okay.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:31.551
I promise.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:35.805
I love you.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.234
Say hi to Mom.

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:00.462
Bye, Daddy.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:14.435
He was a greet guy. You would've
loved him. He was just like me.

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:19.018
Hey ....

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:26.448
There's something I've been wanting
to tell you I feel pretty awful about.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.859
I kind of want to get it off my chest. I ....

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.956
I ditched you at the rest stop
in Louisiana.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.494
- What?
- I had no intention of coming back.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.129
So wrong.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:44.252
Why would you do that?

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:47.134
Because I'm a pig. I'm an asshole.
I'm working on it.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.973
Well, you know what?
You came back with doughnuts.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.893
I think that says more
about you than leaving does.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.474
So...

01:15:58.179 --> 01:15:59.226
...just--

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.140
You're something else. Thanks.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.818
That's a load off.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:11.902
Well, there's something I've been
wanting to get off my chest too.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.160
Shoot.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:16.990
I'm not really 23 years old.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:20.872
I know.

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:22.666
It's okay.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.040
The other thing is...

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.502
...Peter...

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.847
...I have your wallet
and I've had it this whole time.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:35.474
What?

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.307
What are you talking about?

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.182
Peter...

01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:44.475
...okay,
listen.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.357
Why would you do that?

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.490
I saw it on the plane
and I didn't wanna be alone.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:53.492
I was feeling vulnerable
because of my father's death.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.656
And I just didn't wanna go across country
by myself, you know?

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:01.079
- It's all here.
- Yeah.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:04.587
All my money, all my credit cards.
Everything ....

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:07.540
Everything I needed.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.591
This whole time.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:17.675
- You're okay with it?
- It's in the past.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.886
What are you gonna do?

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:25.307
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:28.193
- Thanks, Peter.
- Yep.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:31.105
Okay. Okay.
Let's just hit the road then, right?

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.242
- You get Sonny, and I'll drive.
- I'll grab him in a minute.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.744
- After I fucking kill you!
- OW!

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.914
You little thief prick.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.915
Die, thief. You thief.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.534
Calm down!

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:47.088
Peter, count to 10. It'll help. Aah!

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:51.550
The phone's ringing!

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:00.343
- Hello, dear.
- Peter, it's happening.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.807
- What?
- You won't believe it. My water broke.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.981
- How?
- Where are you?

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.018
I'm at the Grand Canyon.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.438
What? Did you just say
the Grand Canyon?

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:14.949
Peter?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:18.031
Mom? He's at the Grand Canyon.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.946
Oh, my God.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:22.198
- Who was it?
- My wife has gone into labor.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:25.785
- I thought we were having a C-section.
- Get in the car.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:29.876
You stepped on my Capezios.
Okay, okay, okay!

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.541
Let's go!

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.126
Good God, you maniac.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:52.149
Not gonna make it. That's great.
I'm gonna miss the birth of my child.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.154
We are gonna make it.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.315
There's no "we." Don't say "we."

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.035
- Okay, look-- No. Me first.
- Please, can I--?

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:05.325
No. You can't. I told you I saw red.

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:08.415
I told you I was gonna put hands on you.
I have a problem.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.501
And I'm sorry you were
the recipient of it.

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.337
But I warned you.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.085
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.096
But in the future,
when we're hanging out as buddies...

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.384
...if we get into a fight,
don't go for my face.

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:25.268
- That's how I make a living. Okay?
- Okay.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:27.975
Still bleeding.

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:31.062
Check the glove, there's probably
a first-aid kit or something.

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:33.770
Clean yourself up.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:36.863
Check this thing out.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.035
Oh, shoot.

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:57.376
I can't believe I did that.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.050
Sorry, Peter. I'm so sorry.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.224
I didn't think it was loaded. Pull over.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.306
- No, I wanna keep going.
- No. Pull over.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.811
- I don't want to.
- Pull over.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.393
No, it didn't happen,
it didn't happen! Why'?!

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:13.605
- I'm in shock!
- It burns!

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:17.571
Pull over! Pull over!

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:23.903
Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.335
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.086
It's right there, yep.

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:42.884
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.141
We gotta stop the bleeding.
I need your scarf.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.644
- Turn around?
- No. No, a tourniquet. A tourniquet.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.270
What the fuck are you doing?

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:53.023
Turn around! Stay still. I got it.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:57.028
You're fine. Right here.
I need you to tie it. I only got one hand.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.439
It's deep.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.778
We're going to a hospital.
We're gonna be fine.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.283
Oh, God! What did I do?

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:06.616
- Stop freaking out. It's okay.
- What did I do? What did I do?

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:10.829
Let's do a little acting exercise like we did
at the rest stop in the bathroom, okay?

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.627
You're a sergeant,
I'm just a grunt in your platoon...

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:18.007
...but you promised me that you'd get me
home to my high-school sweetheart.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.968
Okay.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:22.461
Action.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.175
- Peter.
- Yeah?

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:29.844
I puked on the wound.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.637
I know. It's okay, buddy.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.231
I need you to drive, but we gotta go.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.858
Okay?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.948
Come on.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:47.157
Get in the back seat, private.
What are you, a girl or something?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:48.491
- Excellent.
- Like that?

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.156
- Yeah, let's roll.
- Yeah, okay.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.162
- Figured it out yet?
- Figured what out?

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:33.699
Your son's about to be born.
What will you name him?

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.540
- I'll know it when I see him.
- How about "Sonny"?

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:39.455
No. Not naming my son
after a masturbating dog.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.215
Don't listen to him, Sonny. He loves you.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:44.217
Sonny, no!

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.588
Sonny. Sorry.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.681
We're heading home!

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.905
I made it.

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:07.031
- Okay, come on.
- I made it.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.947
Oh, the monkey, the monkey,
the monkey.

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:17.126
Sonny, we'll be right back, okay?

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.790
Got it.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.581
Oh, fuck.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.090
Thank you.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.678
I have an expectant father
and a gunshot victim.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.555
I know where we're going. Right here.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.515
Then we out left.

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.102
- Shoot.
- What?

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.262
I forgot to crack a window for Sonny.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.148
- The door's off the car, Ethan.
- Right. Okay, good.

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:42.981
See? Together we think of everything.

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.153
Okay, here we go.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.655
- Let's get you cleaned up. Right?
- Great. Yeah.

01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:56.664
Give me these guys.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.873
It's all about to go down.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:03.460
Give you a vest, cover up the blood.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.640
Have I told you that I love your perm?

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:14.303
Thank you, Peter.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.470
Look who's come around.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:19.263
Sarah?

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:21.978
No, come on, come on.
This way, this way. Here we go.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.563
Ma'am.
- Here we go.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.070
Put your handcuffs in your pocket.
Hide them.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.152
- Here's the Rally Monkey.
- Boom.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:31.321
- Ohh!
- Just keep pushing.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.031
Sarah?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.328
- Sarah?
- Peter?

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:36.488
- You hear that?
- Go!

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.158
- Peter!
- Sarah!

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:45.581
Darryl. What the fuck?

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.170
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa, hey.
- Who the hell is this guy?

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:49.880
You gotta go, man. You gotta go.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:51.511
- Peter!
- Peter, it's this way.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:53.513
What the fuck?

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.175
Baby! Baby, you made it!

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:59.595
- Jesus, Peter, are you okay?
- Baby?

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.855
No, I just lost a little blood.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:05.184
- Ohh! Oh, my God!
- Everybody relax.

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:07.352
Relax. We need to find a hospital, okay?

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.613
- Who are you?
- My name is Ethan Tremblay.

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:12.365
- I'm your husband's best friend.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:15.528
Nice to meet you too.
Let's get that baby out of your vagina.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:17.196
Okay.

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:19.615
- Breathe.
- Ahh!

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:25.462
Look at the babies.

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:28.750
Look at that baby, right?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:31.711
You see it?

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.879
- Hey. What do we got?
- You little rascal.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:35.548
- Look what you made.
- Show me.

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:40.136
Ohh. He's really cute.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.554
That's a handsome boy.

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.769
- It's a girl, actually.
- Mm-mm.

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:46.229
- Yep.
- No, the--

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.393
Dr. Greene says it happens all the time.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.608
You know, ultrasounds
aren't always reliable.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:51.818
Right.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.779
- Little Rosie.
- Rosie?

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:58.954
Little Rosie Highman.
Does that sound strange to you?

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:00.830
No, it's such a pretty name.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.162
Sarah thought you'd be okay with it.

01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:06.750
- When did you talk to Sarah?
- Right after I cut the umbilical cord.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:12.134
- You out it?
- The tether of life from mother to child.

01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:13.418
I got to cut that.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:14.882
- No.
- Yes.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:16.092
- You?
- I kept some.

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:18.598
I kept a little bit of it
and put it in my wallet.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:22.636
- It's good for sore ankles and stuff.
- Wow.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:26.853
Wow. Oh, my God.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.855
Oh, my God. Ethan, I dreamt this.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.942
- This is crazy. I had this strange dream...
- Yeah?

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:34.448
...that was today.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.654
And there was a bear.

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:38.531
What?

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:40.446
- And the bear chewed the cord.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:43.912
That's spot-on if you think about it.
That's like a one in a ....

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.121
You know what I mean?

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:47.206
- I don't get it. What--?
- Forget it.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.292
It's-- it's....

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.800
It's gotta be a good sign.

01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.883
I guess I'll maybe leave you
with your family...

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.393
...and I got that meeting with that agent.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:04.599
- It's Friday.
- Yeah.

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:05.853
Yeah, good luck.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:09.600
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:12.857
It has all of my information.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.898
- Mm-hm.
- In case you wanna get a soda.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.987
- Or, you know, I could babysit.
- Right.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.827
I'll keep it handy.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.872
We had a crazy few days.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.540
That was nuts.

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:32.001
We should do it again.
Go across country again.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.166
Okay.

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.919
- Sure.
- Call me tomorrow about it.

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:39.763
- If I don't--
- Call me tomorrow about it.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:42.595
I might e-mail you.
Please don't take it personally.

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:43.930
No, no, e-mail's fine.

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:50.065
- Bye, Sonny.
- Do you mind if Sonny and I take the truck?

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.691
Feel free.

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:55.771
- It's been a real pleasure, Peter.
- Been a lot of things.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.200
Thanks.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.205
Hey. Ethan.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:17.379
Welcome to Hollywood.

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:19.795
What? You want me
to come back and talk to you?

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.055
I was just saying
in the most general sense.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.553
The city welcomes you.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.970
Just make sure you call me tomorrow.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:30.393
I'll call you.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:41.484
Be right there.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:47.326
Hello?

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:52.502
Oh, hey. I'm Stu, the tutor.
Are you Jake?

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.288
No, I'm his father.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:56.172
Oh.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.466
I'm Stu, the tutor.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.252
Right.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.921
Have you been smoking pot?

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:05.136
No, sir. Not at all.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:07.931
Perhaps you're smelling my cat.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.098
- Your oat?
- Yes, sir. He's an outdoor cat.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.608
You know what, he's really funny.

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:17.815
Don't get crazy.
I'm telling you, the show's funny.

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:20.356
Come on. You love him.
You know you love him.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.775
I survived him. There's e difference.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:26.536
Um, uh, Charlie, this is Jake 's tutor, Stu.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:29.448
- Hey.
- I'm not high, man, it's my cat.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.118
Relax, Stu. We're not cops.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:35.162
Oh, really? He sure looks like the heat.

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:38.502
Like clockwork. I told him
we'd call him after we watched it.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.338
He's excited.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:43.887
If she says his name, I'll freak out.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.222
Pita bread?

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.632
Hummus?

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.468
Again, no thank you.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.980
You got any more pot?

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.850
Not for $9 an hour I don't.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:30:00.149
I mean, I don't know
what you're talking about.
