00:15.360 --> 00:18.811
[tense orchestral music]

01:30.400 --> 01:33.162
- [Narrator] They are the
most mysterious of beings,

01:33.231 --> 01:37.545
gods, angels, aliens,
or ordinary men

01:37.614 --> 01:39.685
with incredible
knowledge or wisdom.

01:40.514 --> 01:41.515
Nobody's sure.

01:46.589 --> 01:50.834
The culture of Mesopotamia
is rich and complex.

01:50.903 --> 01:54.114
Historians have been slowly
unraveling their secrets.

02:00.534 --> 02:02.191
From the epic of Gilgamesh

02:02.260 --> 02:05.539
to the many references of
them in other cultures,

02:05.608 --> 02:09.508
the mystery of the Anunnaki
is becoming more clear.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.965
To western eyes, their
ways are strange.

02:18.034 --> 02:21.589
Over hundreds of years they
have been called gods and angels

02:21.658 --> 02:24.144
and now in our modern
age, many see them as

02:24.213 --> 02:27.906
aliens visiting earth and
bringing great knowledge.

02:33.739 --> 02:36.915
The truth of their
real origin and purpose

02:36.984 --> 02:39.642
is much more bizarre and amazing

02:39.711 --> 02:41.816
than anything
previously believed.

02:47.477 --> 02:50.377
Prepare to witness
the demystification

02:50.446 --> 02:52.586
of a sacred and ancient past.

02:54.553 --> 02:58.316
Prepare to see the Anunnaki
as they really were,

02:58.385 --> 03:01.146
and in so doing, we
will discover the truth

03:01.215 --> 03:03.562
about so many other things,

03:03.631 --> 03:06.807
from the Garden of Eden
to the great flood,

03:06.876 --> 03:10.569
from the god of the bible
to the secrets of Inuk,

03:10.638 --> 03:12.019
all shall be revealed.

03:19.509 --> 03:22.857
In truth, the Anunnaki
are a group of ancient

03:22.926 --> 03:25.584
Mesopotamian deities.

03:25.653 --> 03:28.484
They are to be found
in Sumerian, Akkadian,

03:28.553 --> 03:31.245
Babylonian, and
Assyrian cultures.

03:35.663 --> 03:39.391
Their exact numbers,
descriptions, and roles

03:39.460 --> 03:41.186
all contradict each other.

03:44.569 --> 03:47.330
According to the
earliest Sumerian texts,

03:47.399 --> 03:50.713
the Anunnaki were the
most powerful of gods

03:50.782 --> 03:54.406
in a rich pantheon and
were descended from An,

03:54.475 --> 03:56.028
the greatest of the gods.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.176
Later, they became
the seven judges

04:06.246 --> 04:09.732
who sit upon the throne
in the underworld.

04:13.011 --> 04:15.013
They remain this
way for some time,

04:15.082 --> 04:17.567
even in the epic of Gilgamesh.

04:18.741 --> 04:21.226
According to old
Babylonian texts,

04:21.295 --> 04:24.194
they were gods of the
underworld, not of heaven.

04:27.474 --> 04:31.685
The name simply means
offspring of Anu or An,

04:31.754 --> 04:34.135
the sky lord and king.

04:37.932 --> 04:40.141
The most prominent and
probably well-known

04:40.210 --> 04:42.282
of the Anunnaki was Enlil,

04:42.351 --> 04:45.319
who cleaved heaven
and earth in two.

04:50.048 --> 04:52.464
Anu decided to take the heavens,

04:52.533 --> 04:55.053
and left the earth
to Enlil and Ki.

04:56.226 --> 04:58.539
Ki is most likely
the Sumerian version

04:58.608 --> 05:00.161
of the mother goddess

05:00.230 --> 05:02.440
seen in cultures
across the globe.

05:12.173 --> 05:16.316
The physical evidence of worship
of the Anunnaki is scarce.

05:17.455 --> 05:20.492
Most of what we know
comes to us from texts.

05:20.561 --> 05:22.667
It appears that
each of the Anunnaki

05:22.736 --> 05:26.395
were worshiped separately
in individual cults.

05:26.464 --> 05:28.673
And because of this, no evidence

05:28.742 --> 05:31.331
of them as a group
has been found,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.885
no image of them all together.

05:35.576 --> 05:39.097
As such, the practices of
worship of the Anunnaki

05:39.166 --> 05:40.512
is thin on the ground.

05:46.449 --> 05:49.210
The first mention of
them is to be found

05:49.279 --> 05:52.317
in the reign of Gudir, of
the third dynasty of Ur.

05:53.732 --> 05:57.184
It is a term used to denote
the most important deities

05:57.253 --> 06:00.601
of the Sumerian pantheon,
the descendants of An.

06:05.779 --> 06:08.575
Exactly which deities
were members of the group

06:08.644 --> 06:11.888
referred to as the Anunnaki
is difficult to know.

06:14.684 --> 06:18.101
There is no complete list
of them that survives.

06:22.209 --> 06:25.730
One of the texts
mentions 50 or so members

06:25.799 --> 06:29.630
of them associated with
the ancient city of Eridu.

06:29.699 --> 06:32.461
And yet, when we read
of the descent of Inanna

06:32.530 --> 06:36.016
into the underworld,
there are only seven.

06:36.085 --> 06:38.846
They are judges who
condemn her to death.

06:49.754 --> 06:52.929
There is a group of
deities known as the Igigi

06:52.998 --> 06:55.449
and they are sometimes
confused with the Anunnaki.

06:56.899 --> 07:00.558
However, in the poem of Ira,
both groups are different.

07:02.007 --> 07:06.391
In one flood myth, the Igigi
are sixth generation gods

07:06.460 --> 07:08.531
who perform labors
for the Anunnaki.

07:10.015 --> 07:13.950
However, after 40 days, they
revolt against their masters

07:14.019 --> 07:18.196
and so Enki, one of
the Anunnaki, replaces
them with humans.

07:20.578 --> 07:23.063
[tense music]

07:27.516 --> 07:29.414
The similarities with
the biblical flood

07:29.483 --> 07:32.728
in Numbers are quite remarkable.

07:32.797 --> 07:35.593
It is obvious that
Mesopotamian myths

07:35.662 --> 07:38.527
heavily influenced
or were the origin

07:38.596 --> 07:40.943
of much of the
biblical Old Testament.

07:51.540 --> 07:55.613
In the Babylonian creation
text known as the Enuma Elish,

07:55.682 --> 07:59.858
the god Marduk divides the
Anunnaki and gives them roles.

08:09.454 --> 08:12.802
300 in heaven and 300 on earth.

08:13.976 --> 08:16.841
As a thank you, the
Anunnaki built Esagila

08:16.910 --> 08:21.017
as an abode for
Marduk, Enlil, and Ea.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.505
When they had finished, they
built themselves shrines.

08:36.654 --> 08:41.072
In later Assyrian texts, they
were offspring of Anu and Ki

08:41.140 --> 08:42.866
who were brother and sister,

08:42.936 --> 08:46.629
and themselves children of the
gods of the celestial poles

08:46.698 --> 08:50.012
and whose heritage stretched
back to the original gods,

08:50.081 --> 08:51.254
Tiamat and Abzu.

08:52.877 --> 08:55.880
[tense string music]

09:06.511 --> 09:10.308
Here we begin to see clues
to the use of these deities

09:10.377 --> 09:13.414
as names for the
bodies in the sky,

09:13.483 --> 09:15.727
the stars that shine above.

09:29.430 --> 09:33.020
This then, is the
brief knowledge we
have of the Anunnaki.

09:33.918 --> 09:35.747
Now we must delve deeper,

09:35.816 --> 09:38.854
and to do so, we must
enter their world.

09:52.143 --> 09:53.765
Appearing out of nowhere

09:53.834 --> 09:57.355
and at least as early as
the fifth millennium BC,

09:57.424 --> 10:01.670
the earliest known civilization,
the Sumerians of Sumer

10:01.739 --> 10:05.881
in Mesopotamia was initially
a non-Semitic culture.

10:07.227 --> 10:10.851
By 3000 BC, and as a
result of its sophisticated

10:10.920 --> 10:15.097
irrigated agriculture,
Sumer flourished as a nation

10:16.236 --> 10:18.479
and developed a
considerable power base

10:18.548 --> 10:21.690
through the development of
its numerous city-states

10:21.759 --> 10:25.901
like Ur, Uruk, Eridu,
Lagash, and Kish.

10:40.674 --> 10:44.402
It is said that the Sumerians
invented cuneiform writing

10:44.471 --> 10:46.818
and were way ahead
of their time,

10:46.887 --> 10:50.235
having advanced knowledge
in music, poetry,

10:50.304 --> 10:54.274
art, mathematics,
astronomy, and science.

10:54.343 --> 10:57.380
[tense string music]

11:07.218 --> 11:09.979
For the ancient Sumerians,
music was a tool

11:10.048 --> 11:12.257
that helped them
describe the cosmos.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.747
The Sumerians were
later conquered

11:18.816 --> 11:22.958
by their long-term rivals,
the Akkadians and Sargon I.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.103
The Akkadians were
a Semitic people

11:30.172 --> 11:32.657
whose city Akkad
was their capital.

11:38.249 --> 11:42.425
After 2000 BC, Sumeria
Akkad declined as a nation

11:43.841 --> 11:46.636
and was later absorbed
by the expanding empires

11:46.706 --> 11:48.777
of Babylonia and Assyria.

11:58.096 --> 11:59.926
In Sumerian creation myth,

11:59.995 --> 12:03.067
the angels known as the Anunaj,

12:03.136 --> 12:06.311
Anunnaki, or Great Sons of Anu

12:06.380 --> 12:08.141
were the founders
of their culture.

12:18.151 --> 12:22.327
The names angel, Anunaj, and
Anukim have much in common.

12:24.226 --> 12:26.815
They are indicative of
the ancient ancestors

12:26.884 --> 12:30.922
who brought the secrets
to the rest of the world.

12:42.658 --> 12:46.075
Interestingly, Anunnaki
is phonetically similar

12:46.144 --> 12:49.699
to the Hebrew Anakim,
the giant race

12:49.769 --> 12:52.081
who appear in the story later

12:52.150 --> 12:56.258
and also anger Kok, the shaman
from Greenland to Alaska.

12:57.466 --> 13:00.020
They were known as
the shining ones.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.898
The earliest accounts
of the shining ones

13:15.967 --> 13:18.970
can be found in four
principal sources.

13:19.039 --> 13:23.319
Firstly, in the Sumerian tablet
from the library of Nikol

13:23.388 --> 13:26.598
where they are named the Anunaj.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.084
Secondly, in the book of Inok,

13:29.153 --> 13:31.914
where they are
referred to as angels,

13:31.983 --> 13:34.710
watchers, or nephilim.

13:34.779 --> 13:37.575
Thirdly, the in the
book of Jubilees,

13:37.644 --> 13:41.510
and fourthly, in the
biblical book of Genesis,

13:41.579 --> 13:43.684
where they are given
the name Elohim.

13:57.664 --> 14:02.186
The Sumerian El is
usually translated as god,

14:02.255 --> 14:06.086
but the feminine Elohim
is the plural of El.

14:07.294 --> 14:11.091
In Genesis, the phrase
A-Elohim is also used,

14:12.334 --> 14:14.784
meaning the Elohim.

14:26.589 --> 14:29.730
El means brightness and shining.

14:29.799 --> 14:31.905
Indeed, the Semitic word El

14:31.974 --> 14:34.666
is found in many
ancient languages.

14:34.735 --> 14:38.878
For instance, the Anglo-Saxon
Aelf means shining being,

14:40.017 --> 14:43.399
so El needs to be
translated not as god,

14:43.468 --> 14:48.370
but as the shining one,
and A-Elohim, being plural,

14:48.439 --> 14:51.235
should read the shining ones.

14:51.304 --> 14:54.376
[tense string music]

15:08.942 --> 15:11.876
We find that this is the
most commonly-used term

15:11.945 --> 15:16.639
in the Old Testament for God,
and indeed, all other gods,

15:16.708 --> 15:20.885
as the scribes even recognized
other gods at that time.

15:29.066 --> 15:32.379
The name Sumer
comes from Shumer,

15:32.448 --> 15:35.969
and means literally the
land of the watchers.

15:36.038 --> 15:40.525
It is none other than the
ancient biblical land of Shinar,

15:40.594 --> 15:44.322
which amazingly means the
place of the shining ones.

15:51.191 --> 15:53.297
The shining ones
are in the bible,

15:53.366 --> 15:56.438
and have been there ever since
they wrote themselves in.

16:07.414 --> 16:12.109
Elohim is usually translated
incorrectly as lord,

16:12.178 --> 16:15.595
and if you read the
bible and replace lord,

16:15.664 --> 16:18.391
and don't forget
about the added words,

16:18.460 --> 16:22.878
with shining ones, you will
see a remarkable difference,

16:22.947 --> 16:26.675
a reading now of how
it was meant to be.

16:26.744 --> 16:29.505
We now have the shining
light of knowledge

16:29.574 --> 16:33.302
spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:6.

16:33.371 --> 16:36.547
The lord God of the
bible is the light

16:36.616 --> 16:40.792
who gives birth to the
divine spark of Christ.

16:40.861 --> 16:43.416
A pure reading of the
global understanding

16:43.485 --> 16:48.248
that god was the basis for
illumination, the fire,

16:48.317 --> 16:52.218
the sun, the light,
and heads of those

16:52.287 --> 16:54.944
that shine from that brilliance,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.326
the source of
intelligence itself.

17:08.441 --> 17:11.339
Anu or An was the
chief sky sun god

17:13.411 --> 17:14.930
and means shining.

17:19.486 --> 17:23.766
The Anunaj therefore means
sons of the shining one,

17:23.835 --> 17:25.596
or sons of light.

17:31.395 --> 17:35.088
In Ireland, the term
for shining was aine.

17:36.503 --> 17:39.748
There may be a connection here
with the Tuatha De Danaan,

17:39.817 --> 17:41.853
the shining ones of Ireland,

17:41.922 --> 17:43.890
and the serpent cult
that Saint Patrick

17:43.959 --> 17:45.857
had removed from
the Emerald Isle.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.217
Also there is an
unusual semi-nomadic
bear worshiping tribe

18:01.218 --> 18:04.359
in Japan known as the Ainu.

18:04.428 --> 18:07.638
The Ainu look Caucasian,
with round heads,

18:07.707 --> 18:11.883
white skin, wavy thick
hair, and gray or blue eyes.

18:13.230 --> 18:15.611
The Ainu are said
to have been living

18:15.680 --> 18:18.545
in many of Japan's
islands like Okinawa

18:18.614 --> 18:22.273
for over 7,000 years,
and it is said that

18:22.342 --> 18:26.519
the Ainu share a language
similarity with the Basque,

18:26.588 --> 18:28.348
who live in the Pyrenees,

18:28.417 --> 18:31.903
the mountains bordering
Spain and France.

18:31.972 --> 18:35.114
[upbeat string music]

18:45.089 --> 18:49.818
Also interesting is the fact
that in these Ainu regions,

18:49.887 --> 18:52.855
a number of stone
circles have been found

18:52.924 --> 18:55.962
with a slender upright
stone in the center,

18:56.031 --> 19:00.173
similar to those found in the
British Isles and elsewhere.

19:13.393 --> 19:16.258
These Anunnaki or shining ones

19:16.327 --> 19:19.848
were a culturally and
technically advanced people

19:19.917 --> 19:22.230
who settled in a mountain valley

19:22.299 --> 19:25.647
in the Middle East
around 8200 BC

19:26.648 --> 19:29.513
and as their primary concern,

19:29.582 --> 19:32.964
established an agricultural
center we now know

19:33.033 --> 19:35.933
as the Garden of
Eden for the teaching

19:36.002 --> 19:37.969
and training of the
local tribesmen.

19:52.812 --> 19:55.470
They were described as
the shining countenance

19:55.539 --> 19:59.646
to lords of cultivation,
elevated to gods.

20:05.342 --> 20:08.414
Anu and his wife,
Antu had two sons.

20:08.483 --> 20:12.659
Enlil the storm god, ruled
the air and atmosphere,

20:13.695 --> 20:15.455
and Enki, the water.

20:22.497 --> 20:26.294
Enki is also the wise
teacher known as Ir

20:26.363 --> 20:31.195
or Oannes, who led the fish
beings that came from the sea,

20:31.264 --> 20:33.749
or indeed from a cross the sea.

20:44.139 --> 20:48.039
Enki was depicted as a
goat with a fish's tail.

20:48.108 --> 20:50.387
It became the sign of Capricorn.

21:02.019 --> 21:06.437
Enki or Ir's consort
was Nimke or Damkina

21:06.506 --> 21:10.648
and their children
were Marduk and Nyach.

21:10.717 --> 21:14.065
Enlil, also known as Bel or Bal

21:14.134 --> 21:16.758
and whose patron
city with Nippur,

21:16.827 --> 21:18.932
later ruled in Anu's name.

21:22.488 --> 21:25.801
Nimil or Ninhursag
ruled the Earth.

21:29.771 --> 21:32.083
The early Sumerians
described themselves

21:32.152 --> 21:35.742
as constantly nourished
by the milk of Ninhursag,

21:35.811 --> 21:37.917
the great mother moon goddess.

21:41.714 --> 21:45.614
The Assyrians knew her as
Atargatis, the mermaid.

21:58.627 --> 22:03.356
The sun of Enlil and Ninmah
was the war god Ninurta,

22:03.425 --> 22:05.151
also known as Nimrod.

22:06.290 --> 22:09.328
And like Horus and as Osiris,

22:09.397 --> 22:12.952
he became associated with the
star constellation of Orion.

22:24.998 --> 22:28.657
We also have Nana, who
was the moon goddess,

22:28.726 --> 22:32.903
and Utu, the sun god, also
known as Ogmash and Shamash.

22:34.422 --> 22:38.564
It was Shamash who later gave
the 29 laws to King Hammurabi.

22:55.201 --> 22:58.100
There is also Inanna or Ishtar

22:58.169 --> 23:00.793
who was associated with Venus,

23:00.862 --> 23:02.657
as symbolized by the pentacle.

23:09.353 --> 23:13.357
The texts that we have on
the Sumerian deities vary.

23:13.426 --> 23:16.015
In fact, they evolve over time,

23:16.084 --> 23:20.502
losing some of their historicity
as the story develops,

23:20.571 --> 23:23.609
making it more and more
difficult to see the origins.

23:40.039 --> 23:42.006
Trying to bring
clarity to the tales

23:42.075 --> 23:45.320
of Sumerian and
Mesopotamian deities is like

23:45.389 --> 23:48.496
trying to learn
Mandarin backwards.

23:48.565 --> 23:51.430
However, due to the
names we are given,

23:51.499 --> 23:53.639
such as Enki, for instance,

23:53.708 --> 23:56.814
who is identified with
Ir and and Oannes,

23:56.883 --> 23:59.886
we are being led to
cross-reference the Anunaj

23:59.955 --> 24:03.234
with the fish beings who
seem to have come ashore

24:03.303 --> 24:07.584
in Sumeria from the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf,

24:07.653 --> 24:11.415
and at a time which is
now lost in antiquity.

24:28.294 --> 24:31.573
Indeed, we find that
both are the same people

24:31.642 --> 24:35.819
and that the fish beings are
also the Anunnaki shining ones,

24:37.027 --> 24:40.202
the gods of Sumeria, and
the Elohim of the bible.

24:48.107 --> 24:51.006
And when we then cross-reference
these fish beings

24:51.075 --> 24:54.838
with the Nita gods and
the Shemsu-hor, or Aku,

24:56.046 --> 24:59.118
and whom it is said
appeared in Egypt

24:59.187 --> 25:01.223
from a submerged island,

25:01.292 --> 25:05.193
we also have to include the
origins of the Hindu Naga,

25:05.262 --> 25:09.024
serpent deities who also
came from a lost island.

25:28.043 --> 25:30.977
It can easily be concluded
that the shining ones

25:31.046 --> 25:34.602
of Sumeria, Egypt,
and India were really

25:34.671 --> 25:38.537
incoming people from a
lost or destroyed land.

25:46.475 --> 25:51.135
These connections allow us
to piece together their story

25:51.204 --> 25:54.414
and see a little more of
the historical territory,

25:54.483 --> 25:58.626
much of which was been lost or
deliberately hidden from us.

26:17.886 --> 26:20.371
We can see then that
these shining ones,

26:20.440 --> 26:22.684
who later became
worshiped as the Sumerian

26:22.753 --> 26:25.169
pantheon of gods and goddesses

26:25.238 --> 26:29.588
seem to have been a dynastic
ruling family or clan.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.211
Anu, the chief authority,

26:32.280 --> 26:35.214
became the universal father god,

26:35.283 --> 26:38.389
as a pictograph from
his founded city of Uruk

26:38.458 --> 26:41.427
dated to 3000 BC depicts.

26:55.752 --> 26:58.720
The lineages of all
these deities are mixed,

26:58.789 --> 27:00.757
with sisters,
wives, and mothers,

27:00.826 --> 27:03.794
fathers, brothers,
and sons intermingling

27:03.863 --> 27:05.589
and confusing the whole thing.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.736
Considering the many
thousands of years

27:14.805 --> 27:17.359
between the composition
of these texts

27:17.428 --> 27:20.777
and the actual existence
of these peculiar peoples

27:20.846 --> 27:23.607
or beliefs, this is no surprise.

27:24.746 --> 27:27.715
What is clear is that
certain deities do

27:27.784 --> 27:30.649
continually stand
out from the crowd.

27:30.718 --> 27:33.824
Namely, Anu, Enlil, Enki,

27:33.893 --> 27:36.827
Ninhursag, Inanna,
and Utu Shamash.

27:38.277 --> 27:41.211
[mysterious music]

27:54.086 --> 27:57.468
And that the form and
structure of these deities

27:57.537 --> 28:01.576
would go on to spawn
Egyptian, Greek, and Roman

28:01.645 --> 28:04.752
pantheons for centuries,
if not thousands of years.

28:12.552 --> 28:15.245
No wonder, then,
that the watchers,

28:15.314 --> 28:17.765
the military arm of
the shining ones,

28:17.834 --> 28:20.595
should in later
myths be doing battle

28:20.664 --> 28:23.805
with the gods of
Greece, Egypt, and Rome,

28:23.874 --> 28:26.981
not to mention the
rest of the world.

28:36.542 --> 28:40.097
Just as the fallen insurgent
nephilim, or watchers,

28:40.166 --> 28:42.479
do battle with their
own ruling family

28:42.548 --> 28:44.688
of shining ones in the bible.

28:51.281 --> 28:54.318
One interesting detail
we should perhaps mention

28:54.387 --> 28:57.080
is that like Osiris
of ancient Egypt,

28:57.149 --> 29:00.566
Enlil was depicted as a bull,

29:00.635 --> 29:02.257
and like Set, his brother,

29:02.326 --> 29:06.503
Enki of the Abzu or abyss,
was depicted as a serpent.

29:08.263 --> 29:11.232
Interestingly, because
the people of Atlantis

29:11.301 --> 29:13.717
were supposed to have
worshiped the bull,

29:13.786 --> 29:15.995
which is a remarkable
coincidence,

29:16.064 --> 29:18.653
taking into the account that
the association with deities

29:18.722 --> 29:19.654
have with the biblical deluge.

29:36.119 --> 29:39.018
It is said that Enlil, who
took over as the leader

29:39.087 --> 29:43.022
of the shining ones lived
for thousands of years,

29:43.091 --> 29:46.267
but those who use this
to show that these

29:46.336 --> 29:49.615
shining ones were special beings

29:49.684 --> 29:52.480
that originally came
from another world,

29:52.549 --> 29:56.967
or even another dimension,
forget one thing,

29:57.036 --> 30:00.315
that Enlil was a term
used for the leader

30:00.384 --> 30:03.871
and was thus passed
on like the term

30:03.940 --> 30:06.356
king or Pharaoh is passed on.

30:11.499 --> 30:14.502
It was also the
title of the sun,

30:14.571 --> 30:17.988
which of course would
seem to be eternal.

30:35.005 --> 30:37.870
Part of the Sumerian
creation myth states

30:37.939 --> 30:41.080
at Karsak, where
heaven and earth met,

30:42.564 --> 30:47.086
the heavenly assembly, the
great sons of Anu, arrived,

30:47.155 --> 30:48.743
the many wise ones.

30:50.296 --> 30:52.678
The Anunnaki seem
to have arrived

30:52.747 --> 30:55.439
from another land
across the sea.

30:55.508 --> 30:57.407
They brought with
them special knowledge

30:57.476 --> 31:00.030
unknown to the
previous inhabitants.

31:07.003 --> 31:11.110
It is said mankind learned
from the shining ones,

31:11.179 --> 31:13.250
they set things in order.

31:29.266 --> 31:33.305
We could ask why they felt they
had to set things in order.

31:33.374 --> 31:35.928
Perhaps this order
has something to do

31:35.997 --> 31:39.552
with the chaotic aftermath
of a global calamity

31:39.621 --> 31:41.830
that had destroyed
their homeland,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.384
according to the accounts.

31:45.455 --> 31:49.631
A flood, for instance, appears
in myths across the world.

32:02.541 --> 32:05.682
In the famous
Sumerian kings list,

32:05.751 --> 32:09.030
we are told that the
Anunnaki ruled in Sumeria

32:09.099 --> 32:11.895
both before and
after the deluge,

32:13.310 --> 32:14.898
and that it was after the deluge

32:14.967 --> 32:17.038
that they then set
kings on the throne

32:17.107 --> 32:20.904
to govern the land and
rule in their stead.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.527
However, if we are to
believe the accounts

32:23.596 --> 32:25.702
given of the fish beings,

32:25.771 --> 32:28.498
we are also told that
these shining ones

32:28.567 --> 32:32.433
had first come ashore
from their submerged land

32:32.502 --> 32:34.814
after a similar catastrophe,

32:34.883 --> 32:37.576
an earlier one than
the deluge related

32:37.645 --> 32:40.234
in the bible and other sources.

32:54.110 --> 32:57.078
Could these great
global flood disasters

32:57.147 --> 33:00.564
in fact be bringing together
tales of a much earlier flood

33:00.633 --> 33:04.672
and so scientists are
searching for the wrong period?

33:04.741 --> 33:06.881
It's possible that
the shining ones knew

33:06.950 --> 33:10.574
when these catastrophic
events were going to happen

33:10.643 --> 33:12.887
and had predicted the deluge,

33:12.956 --> 33:16.891
hence, Noah being born
to prepare for the event.

33:16.960 --> 33:20.032
[tense string music]

33:28.523 --> 33:31.388
This theory is supported
by the information

33:31.457 --> 33:33.425
encoded in various sources

33:33.494 --> 33:37.429
which lead us to the symbol
of the Ouroboros snake

33:37.498 --> 33:38.775
and its deeper meaning.

33:40.156 --> 33:44.056
It is as if again these
people had profound knowledge

33:44.125 --> 33:48.267
of cycles, and in
particular the 25,800 year

33:49.751 --> 33:52.409
processional cycle which
was believed to have begun

33:52.478 --> 33:56.310
with the tilting of the Earth
from its upright position.

34:12.014 --> 34:14.466
It would appear that it
was believed that these

34:14.534 --> 34:17.193
recurring catastrophes
were linked to

34:17.262 --> 34:20.713
the beginning and end point
of the processional cycle,

34:20.782 --> 34:23.475
linked to the very
event that caused

34:23.543 --> 34:25.891
the Earth to incline
in the first place.

34:31.206 --> 34:33.036
This does not necessarily prove

34:33.105 --> 34:35.694
that the Earth's axis
was once upright,

34:35.763 --> 34:38.766
however it does mean
that it was believed

34:38.835 --> 34:40.733
the axis was vertical,

34:40.802 --> 34:43.150
and thus revealing
an amazing knowledge

34:43.219 --> 34:45.773
of the heavens and
Earth's place in it.

34:51.951 --> 34:54.505
There is evidence that
the ecliptic center

34:54.574 --> 34:56.473
was the abode of the father god,

34:56.542 --> 34:59.511
as this was actually named Anu

34:59.580 --> 35:03.653
as well as the Eye of Ra
by the ancient Egyptians.

35:03.722 --> 35:06.897
[somber string music]

35:17.184 --> 35:20.808
Also, the ancient astronomers
of these shining ones

35:20.877 --> 35:24.018
must have believed that
the processional cycle

35:24.087 --> 35:26.710
was linked with the
Earth's own life cycle

35:26.779 --> 35:29.610
or reincarnation cycle,

35:29.679 --> 35:32.613
and so the Earth being
upright would bring

35:32.682 --> 35:35.374
a more harmonious and
balanced existence.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.653
No more global catastrophes,

35:38.722 --> 35:41.656
and no birth, death,
rebirth cycle.

35:43.071 --> 35:46.178
In other words, the Earth,
like the spiritual man

35:46.247 --> 35:49.975
who seeks to come off and out
of the reincarnation cycle

35:50.044 --> 35:52.495
and all cycles, for that matter,

35:52.564 --> 35:55.912
would have been seen to
be in the perfect position

35:55.981 --> 35:59.087
and the perfect
spiritual condition.

36:12.411 --> 36:16.967
We also find that these
people are also termed Igigi,

36:17.036 --> 36:20.557
which was also the name of
the king after the flood.

36:20.626 --> 36:23.008
The Igigi in certain
texts seem to do the work

36:23.077 --> 36:26.632
of the Anunnaki, whereas
in others the are equal

36:26.701 --> 36:28.427
and spoken of in
the same breath.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.547
In the epic on Anzu,
the Igigi are superior

36:44.616 --> 36:48.792
in the sense that the Anunnaki
are of the Abzu or the deep.

36:50.484 --> 36:53.728
This, of course, must
remind us of the Hindu ideas

36:53.797 --> 36:57.284
of the Naga, serpent deities
who reside in the deep

36:57.353 --> 36:59.665
and are no less holy for it.

37:13.023 --> 37:17.235
In the Sumerian account,
Ninlil or Ninkarsak,

37:17.304 --> 37:21.204
lady of Karsak, the wife
of the leader Enlil,

37:21.273 --> 37:25.346
asked the council of seven
to create her an Eden.

37:39.947 --> 37:44.434
This is the very same Eden or
plateau as in the bible myth

37:44.503 --> 37:47.195
and the council of
seven is the same

37:47.265 --> 37:50.820
as the seven archangels
or messengers of the bible

37:50.889 --> 37:54.996
who came down from heaven or
the mountain or cosmic sky.

38:01.762 --> 38:03.936
Sumerians referred to Edin

38:05.352 --> 38:07.285
as the abode of
the righteous ones.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.436
The tree of life and
the tree of knowledge

38:20.505 --> 38:23.231
that stood in this
garden of Eden

38:23.301 --> 38:25.786
are the secrets of
the shining ones,

38:25.855 --> 38:29.168
secrets which will stay with
them for thousands of years

38:29.237 --> 38:31.757
to be told only to
the highest shaman,

38:31.826 --> 38:34.760
adept, priest,
avatar, or prophet.

38:46.841 --> 38:48.878
In their dream-like trances,

38:48.947 --> 38:51.881
the shaman saw and
experienced the tree

38:51.950 --> 38:54.124
which took them to heaven

38:54.193 --> 38:56.264
and which later became
the tree of life

38:56.334 --> 38:58.094
in the Hebrew Kabbalah system,

38:59.233 --> 39:02.754
and as if reflecting
the seven chakra levels

39:02.823 --> 39:06.551
of the human spinal column
and the processes involved

39:06.620 --> 39:10.071
with ones own access to
the knowledge within,

39:10.140 --> 39:13.040
the Sumerians built their
towers, or ziggurats,

39:13.109 --> 39:15.042
with seven levels

39:15.111 --> 39:17.527
as attempts to build
closer to heaven,

39:17.596 --> 39:19.426
to be like the mountains,

39:19.495 --> 39:23.913
and link them with Earth as in
the dream of Jacob's ladder.

39:23.982 --> 39:27.261
[hopeful string music]

39:39.791 --> 39:42.172
It is said that
these shining deities

39:42.241 --> 39:45.866
also lived at the top of
the ziggurat or pyramid,

39:45.935 --> 39:47.971
the great house.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.803
We now know what the
ladder and these temples

39:51.872 --> 39:54.288
really stand for symbolically,

39:54.357 --> 39:57.395
but was Jacob's ladder
a similar construction

39:57.464 --> 39:59.155
somewhere in the near East?

40:07.543 --> 40:10.649
Jacob was, in fact, the
father of the 12 tribes

40:10.718 --> 40:13.894
and as such, the
father of the zodiac.

40:30.462 --> 40:34.501
Reuben, Jacob's first
son, was Aquarius,

40:34.570 --> 40:38.401
hence the reason he
was unstable as water.

40:39.851 --> 40:43.924
Simeon and Levi were the
brothers and hence Gemini.

40:43.993 --> 40:48.169
Judah was the lion, and
Zebulun is Libra, the ship.

40:49.654 --> 40:53.589
Gad is Pisces, in that it
is a reversal of the fish

40:54.693 --> 40:58.007
serpent god Dak,
associated with Dagon,

40:58.076 --> 40:59.767
Oannes, Ea, and Henki.

41:01.182 --> 41:05.048
Dan was of the tribe of
serpents, an adder in the path

41:05.117 --> 41:09.467
who falleth backward
into the winter solstice,

41:09.536 --> 41:11.848
which means he is Capricorn.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.645
This is the same as
the later Daniel,

41:16.853 --> 41:19.718
again the shining
serpent Capricorn

41:19.787 --> 41:21.099
who traverses the heavens.

41:36.804 --> 41:40.256
We can now see that most
of these myths and stories

41:40.325 --> 41:44.778
are mere transiterations of
astrotheological ideologies

41:44.847 --> 41:47.090
associated with the zodiac

41:47.159 --> 41:49.921
and also the processional cycle,

41:49.990 --> 41:52.440
which can be used
as means to find

41:52.510 --> 41:54.650
relevant periods in history.

41:54.719 --> 41:57.791
[tense string music]

42:10.010 --> 42:13.116
Processional cycle
is intimately tied in

42:13.185 --> 42:15.084
with our own life cycle,

42:15.153 --> 42:18.363
and so we find that
many of these epithets

42:18.432 --> 42:20.676
given to individuals in history

42:20.745 --> 42:22.816
who may or may not have existed

42:22.885 --> 42:25.059
are really part of a code.

42:26.474 --> 42:29.754
This shows that the later
leaders and their priesthoods

42:29.823 --> 42:31.963
who were spiritual and god-like

42:32.032 --> 42:34.621
and also knowledgeable
in astronomy,

42:34.690 --> 42:37.209
were related to the
shining ones sect

42:37.278 --> 42:40.247
and even received their
knowledge and authority

42:40.316 --> 42:42.180
from the shining ones.

42:42.249 --> 42:43.906
They associated the shining ones

42:43.975 --> 42:47.081
with the solar and celestial
bodies which they studied.

42:48.048 --> 42:51.120
[tense string music]

43:03.166 --> 43:06.238
The seven shining
ones or seven sages

43:06.307 --> 43:09.932
of different cultures
later became the gods

43:10.001 --> 43:12.175
in men, incarnated as man,

43:13.694 --> 43:18.147
only then to be reunited with
a father god after death.

43:18.216 --> 43:20.839
This is basically
the Christian myth.

43:20.908 --> 43:23.980
It is the celestial
bodies being written down

43:24.049 --> 43:27.605
in human form, a
pantheon of seven

43:27.674 --> 43:30.642
and corresponding with the
seven planets in the heavens.

43:46.693 --> 43:49.799
The phrase "where
heaven and Earth met"

43:49.868 --> 43:52.181
is symbolic of the
sacred mountains,

43:52.250 --> 43:55.805
and this gives us the clue
that this could be somewhere

43:55.874 --> 44:00.120
with impressive heaven-like
mountains, such as Tibet,

44:00.189 --> 44:03.882
perhaps even the
ziggurats of Mesopotamia,

44:03.951 --> 44:05.712
or even the pyramids of Giza,

44:08.128 --> 44:11.200
seeing as these temple
constructions are based

44:11.269 --> 44:13.202
on the shamanic world mountain.

44:29.218 --> 44:31.738
We can see, then, that
many of the details

44:31.807 --> 44:35.155
included in the stories
related to the activities

44:35.224 --> 44:37.985
of these shining
ones are really based

44:38.054 --> 44:40.367
on these astrotheological
movements

44:40.436 --> 44:43.439
which they understood
to a great degree

44:43.508 --> 44:46.442
and have been encoded in
these myths and stories

44:46.511 --> 44:48.616
as a means to preserve
this knowledge

44:48.686 --> 44:50.929
and also convey this process

44:50.998 --> 44:52.690
to those who could
understand it.

44:53.552 --> 44:56.555
[tense string music]

45:11.122 --> 45:13.400
They added encoded information

45:13.469 --> 45:16.334
which also makes these
stories somewhat confusing.

45:17.438 --> 45:20.062
The story of the
Anunnaki is therefore

45:20.131 --> 45:23.444
not one just in the
region of Mesopotamia,

45:23.513 --> 45:25.584
it is in fact a universal system

45:25.653 --> 45:29.416
observed in the sky, and
this is why similarities

45:29.485 --> 45:32.522
can be found across the
world in ancient cultures.

45:48.987 --> 45:51.507
The biblical flood
myth matches that found

45:51.576 --> 45:53.854
in Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh,

45:53.923 --> 45:56.823
and ends with the Tower
of Babel in Babylon,

45:56.892 --> 45:58.997
which was part of
the Sumerian empire.

46:00.136 --> 46:02.069
This shows that the
secret knowledge

46:02.138 --> 46:04.382
associated with the shining ones

46:04.451 --> 46:07.765
ended up at that
time in Babylon,

46:07.834 --> 46:10.215
and then moved on from there.

46:24.816 --> 46:26.576
In the search for
the shining ones,

46:26.645 --> 46:30.235
we have come across numerous
groups, cults, and religions.

46:30.304 --> 46:34.861
In ancient Sumeria, we find
the Egregore, or watchers,

46:34.930 --> 46:38.761
who are thought to be the angels
of the lord from the bible

46:38.830 --> 46:41.384
and again, the numerous
epithets given to them

46:41.453 --> 46:43.766
tells us they too
were the shining ones.

46:44.871 --> 46:47.597
Enoch wrote about them,
in fact, for them,

46:47.666 --> 46:50.773
in the book of Enoch,
which was later suppressed.

46:52.361 --> 46:55.813
[mysterious string music]

47:06.754 --> 47:09.274
In the bible and
the Book of Enoch,

47:09.343 --> 47:11.380
these shining ones
are called angels,

47:11.449 --> 47:13.796
archangels, or cherubim.

47:19.871 --> 47:23.012
Unless the literature
is purely apocryphal,

47:23.081 --> 47:24.842
we find that in the bible,

47:24.911 --> 47:28.052
the angel figures are
simply earthly men.

47:29.260 --> 47:32.711
In the bible, we do not
find angels with wings.

47:32.780 --> 47:36.854
There are no original stories
of them being supernatural.

47:36.923 --> 47:40.305
They are, in fact,
quite ordinary.

47:40.374 --> 47:43.515
It is always Gabriel,
meaning Man of God,

47:43.584 --> 47:47.588
who informs the people
of a coming child birth.

47:47.657 --> 47:49.556
Was he the shaman, the doctor?

47:50.522 --> 47:53.594
[tense string music]

48:06.918 --> 48:09.472
Michael is the
warrior and protector,

48:09.541 --> 48:12.406
accompanied by angels
wielding swords.

48:16.617 --> 48:20.621
Each and every one of them
has their own specific duty,

48:20.690 --> 48:22.071
an Earthly duty.

48:23.210 --> 48:25.764
People with titles,
angelic titles,

48:25.833 --> 48:28.975
as messengers and
ambassadors of God,

48:29.044 --> 48:31.287
just like the early shaman.

48:37.121 --> 48:40.296
The title cherubim means exiles,

48:40.365 --> 48:44.197
and could be an indication
of the origins of the angels.

48:44.266 --> 48:46.406
Maybe they were ordered
to leave somewhere

48:46.475 --> 48:49.443
for not conforming,
perhaps Eden,

48:49.512 --> 48:51.376
where they had previously
been the watchers

48:51.445 --> 48:53.240
or the guardians of the garden.

49:05.908 --> 49:10.050
In Genesis 4:16, the land of Nod

49:10.119 --> 49:12.915
is symbolic also of
the people of Israel,

49:12.984 --> 49:14.813
as Nod means wanderer.

49:16.091 --> 49:18.852
It is not much of an
extrapolation to assume

49:18.921 --> 49:21.337
that the priesthood
were also wanderers.

49:29.138 --> 49:31.761
Another example
of symbolic titles

49:31.830 --> 49:35.282
is that of Enoch, which
means consecrated.

49:35.351 --> 49:38.527
[somber string music]

49:50.332 --> 49:53.059
When Cain and his
wife bore Enoch

49:53.128 --> 49:55.337
and built a city called Enoch,

49:55.406 --> 49:59.168
we have the people of Cain
being consecrated before God.

50:00.583 --> 50:03.310
Enoch, the consecrated
one, would later write up

50:03.379 --> 50:06.141
the history of his
fallen wanderers

50:06.210 --> 50:10.007
who spread across the globe
as the great shining ones,

50:10.076 --> 50:12.871
teaching, measuring,
and building

50:12.940 --> 50:15.288
the world's most mysterious
ancient monuments.

50:30.475 --> 50:33.651
Of course, we must not
forget the seraphim

50:33.720 --> 50:37.103
of Numbers 21:6 and elsewhere.

50:37.172 --> 50:39.622
These are not mystical beings,

50:39.691 --> 50:42.349
they have hands, a face, legs,

50:42.418 --> 50:44.938
but they do have powers from God

50:45.007 --> 50:47.389
because they are in the light

50:47.458 --> 50:50.909
and have the symbolic
wings of the early shaman,

50:50.978 --> 50:52.635
the bird of flight,

50:52.704 --> 50:55.983
the dream time trance
ability to fly.

50:56.053 --> 50:59.090
[tense string music]

51:09.238 --> 51:13.415
The name means shining
ones or fiery serpents.

51:18.213 --> 51:21.354
They are enlightened beings
by the power of the serpent.

51:26.566 --> 51:30.639
Mystical Jewish literature tells
us that the angels can fly,

51:30.708 --> 51:34.229
tell the future, shape
shift, speak Hebrew,

51:34.298 --> 51:38.233
and are emanations of
the divine shining light.

51:49.278 --> 51:52.247
In the Old Testament,
God is indistinguishable

51:52.316 --> 51:56.458
from the angel or
messenger known as Yahweh.

51:56.527 --> 52:00.289
He looks the same and acts
as his representative.

52:00.358 --> 52:02.809
There is no difference
here from the Babylonian,

52:02.878 --> 52:05.881
Egyptian, and shamanic practice.

52:05.950 --> 52:09.126
[somber string music]

52:17.789 --> 52:20.896
In the New Testament, the
angels actually take part

52:20.965 --> 52:23.795
in the judgment
at the end times.

52:23.864 --> 52:26.350
Alternatively, they may be those

52:26.419 --> 52:31.286
who had experienced
enlightenment and
then fell from grace.

52:31.355 --> 52:34.427
[tense string music]

52:45.403 --> 52:48.095
We are told that the
nephilim or watchers

52:48.165 --> 52:51.823
began to mix with the
indigenous people.

52:51.892 --> 52:54.032
These were the angels
who seemed to have been

52:54.101 --> 52:56.276
the military arm of
the shining ones,

52:56.345 --> 53:00.522
and who were initially employed
to guard the garden of Eden.

53:16.469 --> 53:20.093
It came to pass when the
children of men had multiplied,

53:20.162 --> 53:22.371
but in those days
were born unto them

53:22.440 --> 53:24.787
beautiful and comely daughters,

53:24.856 --> 53:27.583
and the angels, the
children of heaven,

53:27.652 --> 53:31.449
saw and lusted after them
and said to one another

53:31.518 --> 53:34.072
"come, let us choose as wives

53:34.141 --> 53:38.284
"from among the children of
men and beget us children."

53:38.353 --> 53:41.839
And Semjaza, who was their
leader, said unto them

53:41.908 --> 53:45.808
"I fear ye will not indeed
agree to do this deed

53:45.877 --> 53:50.641
"and I alone shall have to pay
the penalty of a great sin,"

53:50.710 --> 53:53.437
and they all
answered him and said

53:53.506 --> 53:55.370
"let us all swear an oath

53:55.439 --> 53:58.925
"and all bind ourselves
by mutual implications

53:58.994 --> 54:03.101
"not to abandon this plan,
but to do this thing."

54:04.102 --> 54:06.173
Then swear they all together

54:06.243 --> 54:10.212
and bound themselves by
mutual implications upon it.

54:10.281 --> 54:13.353
[tense string music]

54:24.640 --> 54:28.644
From this union, a
hybrid race was produced,

54:28.713 --> 54:31.268
a race of giants,
so we are told.

54:38.861 --> 54:40.898
And all the others
together with them

54:40.967 --> 54:44.833
took unto them wives and
each chose for himself one

54:44.902 --> 54:47.387
and they began to go into them

54:47.456 --> 54:49.700
and to defile
themselves with them,

54:49.769 --> 54:52.496
and they taught them
charms and enchantments

54:52.565 --> 54:54.083
and the cutting of roots

54:54.152 --> 54:56.534
and made them
acquainted with plants

54:56.603 --> 54:58.364
and they became pregnant

54:58.433 --> 55:02.747
and they bear great giants
whose height was 3,000 ells,

55:02.816 --> 55:05.371
who consumed all the
acquisitions of men

55:05.440 --> 55:08.374
and when men could no
longer sustain them,

55:08.443 --> 55:12.032
the giants turned against
them and devoured mankind.

55:13.137 --> 55:15.208
They began to sin
against birds and beasts

55:15.277 --> 55:18.867
and reptiles and fish, and
to devour one another's flesh

55:18.936 --> 55:21.214
and drink the blood.

55:21.283 --> 55:23.320
And then the Earth
laid accusations

55:23.389 --> 55:25.563
against the lawless ones,

55:25.632 --> 55:29.291
and then Michael, Auriel,
Raphael, and Gabriel

55:29.360 --> 55:31.949
looked down from heaven and saw

55:32.018 --> 55:34.676
much blood being
shed upon the earth

55:34.745 --> 55:37.886
and all lawlessness being
wrought upon the earth.

55:39.266 --> 55:42.408
[somber string music]

55:48.345 --> 55:51.727
These insurgents also
passed on knowledge

55:51.796 --> 55:55.628
and taught them combat
and how to make weapons.

56:00.011 --> 56:02.876
And Azazel taught
men to make swords

56:02.945 --> 56:06.190
and knives and shields
and breastplates,

56:06.259 --> 56:08.779
and made know to them
the metals of the earth

56:08.848 --> 56:10.643
and the art of working them,

56:10.712 --> 56:13.818
and bracelets and ornaments
and the use of antimony

56:13.887 --> 56:16.511
and the beautifying
of the eyelids

56:16.580 --> 56:21.032
and all kinds of costly stones
in all color and tinctures.

56:21.101 --> 56:23.414
And there arose much godlessness

56:23.483 --> 56:25.623
and they committed fornication

56:25.692 --> 56:27.314
and they were led astray

56:27.384 --> 56:30.214
and became corrupt
in all their ways.

56:30.283 --> 56:33.459
Samyaza taught enchantments
and root cuttings,

56:33.528 --> 56:36.876
armorers the resolving
of enchantments.

56:36.945 --> 56:39.396
Barachiel taught astrology,

56:39.465 --> 56:41.190
talked about the constellations,

56:41.259 --> 56:44.470
Ezakiel the knowledge
of the clouds,

56:44.539 --> 56:46.989
Arakiel the signs of the earth,

56:47.058 --> 56:49.613
Shamshiel the signs of the sun,

56:49.682 --> 56:52.270
and Sariel the
course of the moon.

56:52.339 --> 56:55.032
And as men perished, they cried,

56:55.101 --> 56:56.723
and their cry went up to heaven.

57:07.734 --> 57:10.047
And all this was
seen as a violation

57:10.116 --> 57:14.120
against a set of laws laid
down by the shining ones

57:14.189 --> 57:16.260
who were possessive
of their knowledge.

57:22.818 --> 57:25.649
Thou seest that
Azazel hath done,

57:25.718 --> 57:28.548
you hath taught all
unrighteousness on Earth

57:28.617 --> 57:30.930
and revealed the eternal secrets

57:30.999 --> 57:33.035
which were preserved in heaven

57:33.104 --> 57:35.452
which men were
striving to learn.

57:35.521 --> 57:38.696
And Samyaza to whom thou
hast given authority

57:38.765 --> 57:41.285
to bear rule over his associates

57:41.354 --> 57:44.046
and they have gone to the
daughters of men upon the Earth

57:44.115 --> 57:47.533
and have slept with the women
and have defiled themselves

57:47.602 --> 57:49.983
and revealed to them
all kinds of sins,

57:50.052 --> 57:52.986
and the women have born giants

57:53.055 --> 57:55.575
and the whole Earth
has thereby been filled

57:55.644 --> 57:57.474
with blood and unrighteousness.

57:58.785 --> 58:01.892
[tense string music]

58:10.694 --> 58:15.146
Enoch, the scribe who was
taught by the shining ones

58:15.215 --> 58:18.736
was then employed as a
messenger or intermediary

58:18.805 --> 58:22.257
between the shining ones
and these fallen ones

58:22.326 --> 58:25.087
who had decided to
abandon their divinity,

58:25.156 --> 58:27.124
to live amongst
the tribes of man.

58:39.343 --> 58:42.104
Enoch was then sent
to tell the insurgents

58:42.173 --> 58:45.383
that a severe sentence
had been passed on them

58:45.452 --> 58:47.834
and that they were
soon to be punished.

58:47.903 --> 58:51.355
In brief, the punishment
sent is the flood.

58:52.252 --> 58:55.359
[somber string music]

59:04.368 --> 59:06.612
It is as if the
shining ones wanted to

59:06.681 --> 59:09.235
wash away the sins of the Earth

59:09.304 --> 59:13.170
that had been created by their
own kid, the fallen ones.

59:20.142 --> 59:22.697
In the bible, we
are told that God,

59:22.766 --> 59:25.354
or rather the gods
known as Elohim,

59:25.423 --> 59:28.323
spoke to Noah, telling
him that the seasons

59:28.392 --> 59:31.050
of summer and winter
would be more extreme

59:31.119 --> 59:32.810
from the time of
the flood onward.

59:42.786 --> 59:45.512
This both supports and
is supported in turn

59:45.582 --> 59:48.654
by the Book of Enoch,
which states how

59:48.723 --> 59:52.899
in those days, Noah saw
that the Earth had sunk down

59:52.968 --> 59:55.453
and that destruction was nigh,

59:55.522 --> 59:59.906
and he said "tell me, what is
transacting upon the Earth?

59:59.975 --> 01:00:03.979
"For the Earth labors and
is violently shaking."

01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:19.616
In the King James version
of the bible we find this,

01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:23.412
behold, the lord
maketh the Earth empty

01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:27.002
and maketh it waste and
turneth it upside down

01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:30.972
and scatterth abroad
the inhabitants thereof.

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:35.045
The Earth shall reel to
and fro like a drunkard.

01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:48.955
In Psalm 68:8 it is written

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:52.407
the Earth shook, the
heavens also dropped

01:00:52.476 --> 01:00:55.582
at the presence of God,
and even Sinai itself

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.654
was moved at the
presence of God.

01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:07.525
The heavens dropping would mean

01:01:07.594 --> 01:01:10.425
that to the observers
in the Sinai region,

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:12.979
the earth beneath
their feet was tipping

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:15.672
relatively upward and northward.

01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.054
In his written book,
Timaeus and Critias,

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:22.092
Plato describes an
awful catastrophe

01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:25.440
in which the Earth moved
forwards and backwards

01:01:25.509 --> 01:01:29.202
and again to right and left
and upwards and downwards,

01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:32.481
wandering every way
in all six directions.

01:01:34.104 --> 01:01:36.658
But as many scholars
and researchers have
now acknowledged,

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.040
the god of the
bible and his angels

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:42.112
are said to be the
Sumerian Anu and his sons

01:01:42.181 --> 01:01:45.840
and entourage, the
Anunnaki or shining ones

01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:52.605
who are reported to have
landed in Mesopotamia

01:01:52.674 --> 01:01:54.572
and there created
the Garden of Eden.

01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:01.648
And so we must now
draw our conclusion.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.341
When we first started
out in this task

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.446
of discovering the Anunnaki,

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:09.967
we found a complex and
mystifying series of tales

01:02:10.036 --> 01:02:11.797
that seemed to
make little sense.

01:02:17.872 --> 01:02:20.529
Slowly, we have pulled
apart the names,

01:02:20.598 --> 01:02:24.154
places, and myths to reveal
something very simple.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.783
Many thousands of years ago,

01:02:32.852 --> 01:02:35.406
something catastrophic occurred

01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:38.996
and a highly knowledgeable
and wise people fled.

01:02:46.452 --> 01:02:49.662
They eventually landed
somewhere in Mesopotamia

01:02:49.731 --> 01:02:52.078
where they came across
a less-developed people.

01:02:56.531 --> 01:02:59.845
Civilization emerged
as the new people

01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:02.640
taught their new
people how to build,

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:06.852
mathematics, astronomy,
agriculture, and much more.

01:03:12.443 --> 01:03:15.722
Their wisdom was so great
that later generations

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.759
would call them gods and angels.

01:03:24.386 --> 01:03:28.080
They had descended from
the shining heavenly host,

01:03:28.149 --> 01:03:31.773
but division set in as
the two cultures bred

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.706
and made the blood
line less pure.

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:42.094
The watchers, who had gone bad,

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:44.682
and the shining ones,
who were not happy,

01:03:47.927 --> 01:03:50.792
in a simple tale that
has become very complex

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.690
over vast periods of time.

01:03:55.693 --> 01:03:59.283
In our age, it is being
confused yet further

01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:02.114
by the addition of
extraterrestrial origins

01:04:02.183 --> 01:04:03.563
for the Anunnaki.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:10.432
There is, however, no
need for such imaginings.

01:04:11.606 --> 01:04:13.988
There is simply a need
to understand the time,

01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:17.681
culture, belief
systems, and mind

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.821
of our very human ancestors.

01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:26.241
