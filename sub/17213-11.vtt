00:52.260 --> 00:53.511
Hi.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.723
Oh, hello.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.060
Are you just watching me sleep?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.519
Oh, well, you know, just...

01:03.731 --> 01:05.733
patiently waiting for you to wake up.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.195
So, uh...

01:12.197 --> 01:13.490
we could do this?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.392
What's wrong?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.102
I'm fine. It'll pass.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.695
Marcy, you're bleeding.

03:23.036 --> 03:27.332
Oh, hi. It's Grace Day, calling
to confirm my appointment for 11:45.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.378
Great. I'll see you then. Thanks.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.680
Trevor!

03:50.814 --> 03:52.315
David...

03:53.650 --> 03:55.152
I'm scared.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.904
It's okay. I've got you.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.364
You're gonna be fine.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.372
No, no. Marce...

04:07.455 --> 04:08.874
No. Come on, hon.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.751
Marce!

05:23.865 --> 05:25.158
Coffee?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.994
Well, it's the least I could do.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.622
The least you can do is nothing,

05:30.705 --> 05:33.416
and then leave without telling me,
which is what you usually do.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.460
I'm... gonna get better.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.545
Are you?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.506
Mmm-hmm. Here.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.677
Try it.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.849
Is it good?

05:50.893 --> 05:52.019
It's coffee.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.438
Sorry. Just, uh...

05:55.522 --> 05:57.649
-Don't let me stop you.
-MacLaren.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.154
David?
Yeah, of course I remember you.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.864
What?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.575
Okay, I'll be right there.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.620
I'm sorry.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.539
You have your priorities.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.332
And you are one of them.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.117
No! No!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.119
Stay calm. Ms. Day, I can explain.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.829
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.497
I'm trying to help you.
Please, just relax.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.958
-Help me!
-Stop!

06:56.041 --> 06:58.293
-Please, stop yelling. Stop!
-Help!

06:58.376 --> 07:00.003
There's nobody for miles.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.714
This is all happening for a reason.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.842
You drugged and dragged me into the woods?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.677
I sedated you, yes,

07:07.760 --> 07:10.097
but only because
I had to get you out here.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.764
Off the grid.
Away from all technology.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.102
-This was the only way I could be sure.
-Sure of what?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.728
What are you gonna do to me?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.856
In the historical record,
Grace Day dies at 11:27 a.m.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.067
on the corner
of Westlake and Harmon Avenue.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.070
That's by my dentist.
How... how would--

07:25.153 --> 07:28.031
I scouted the location. It was impossible
to determine what would kill you,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.866
and if I had intervened...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.410
Well, the traffic cams would've allowed
the director to take you.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.498
The director?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.251
Look, I know how it sounds,
but I'm not a crazy person.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.586
Well, do you know this director?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.964
-The director sent me here.
-To do what?

07:44.047 --> 07:45.298
Perform missions.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.425
Like this?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.344
No.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.764
No, I'm breaking protocol by doing this.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.603
Our mission...

07:58.686 --> 08:00.981
is to save the world, Ms. Day.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.527
I'm from the future.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.449
- Agent MacLaren. Hey.
- David. Thanks for calling.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.035
-Yeah.
-You mind giving us a moment?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.288
Yeah. No, of course.
I'll... I'll just, uh...

08:17.830 --> 08:19.082
Thanks.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.127
What happened?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.545
I'm sorry.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.713
I told him a thousand times not to...

08:26.548 --> 08:28.841
Not to take me to the hospital.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.678
No, that's okay. It's fine.
This is exactly where you should be.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.929
Have they told you what's wrong?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.347
I mean, do you...
Do you want to check your charts?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.141
I know what's wrong.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.851
There's too much pre-existing damage.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.603
I don't understand.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.232
My host's brain
was congenitally underdeveloped.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.903
I came up with a treatment
that I thought was working.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.489
I'm sorry that I didn't--

08:51.573 --> 08:53.575
It's all right.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.535
We're gonna fix this.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.828
I don't think that it's...

08:57.912 --> 08:59.081
possible.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.418
You just helped to practically
bring me back from the dead.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.129
Anything's possible.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.975
- Hello?
<i>- Carly, hi.</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:20.643
I wasn't sure I'd be able to reach you.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.272
Oh, I've been off the grid
for a day or so. I'm sorry.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.191
<i>Are you in any danger?</i>

09:26.274 --> 09:28.276
<i>It's okay, you can tell me.</i>

09:28.360 --> 09:30.820
Uh, no, I'm fine.
Why? What is it?

09:30.903 --> 09:34.407
Well, to be honest, I was...

09:34.491 --> 09:36.618
hoping you might have reasons
beyond your control

09:36.701 --> 09:39.204
for why you abandoned your son
at his father's.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.373
Abandoned? He's the father.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.708
<i>I'm well aware, but as he tells it,</i>

09:43.791 --> 09:46.836
you asked him to watch Jeffrey
for a couple of hours,

09:46.919 --> 09:49.046
and haven't returned since.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.715
<i>That was two days ago.</i>

09:50.798 --> 09:52.884
I'm... I'm heading there right now.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.844
<i>Your actions indicate</i>

09:54.927 --> 09:57.430
that you trust him as a caregiver,

09:57.514 --> 10:00.683
so I have acted accordingly
and filed a recommendation

10:00.767 --> 10:03.770
<i>for his father to take custody</i>
<i>until the hearing is settled.</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:05.147
Jacqueline, please!

10:05.230 --> 10:06.731
<i>Have a good day, Ms. Shannon.</i>

10:06.814 --> 10:08.108
Wait!

10:16.449 --> 10:18.118
Traveler 3468,

10:18.743 --> 10:21.871
please greet arriving Traveler 0014 today.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.793
Where's my mom?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.255
Uh, excuse me.
This... this boy's looking for his mom.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.301
It's a calculation, really.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.887
The director studies the historical record
and then assesses which actions to take,

10:37.970 --> 10:39.556
some big, some not so big,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.933
that will best mitigate the conditions
we left behind.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.727
-And how's it going?
-That's hard to say.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.439
See, a while ago, we deflected an asteroid

10:47.522 --> 10:50.275
that would've caused
a huge disaster 18 months from now.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.861
-Yeah, well, that's very big.
-That's what we thought!

10:53.945 --> 10:56.614
We expected that it was gonna
impact the future so much so

10:56.698 --> 10:59.492
that we might even cease to exist,
but nothing's changed!

10:59.576 --> 11:02.829
So if... if something doesn't
work out the way you want it to,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.914
why don't you just go back and try again?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.083
That's an excellent question.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.544
We tried that, of course.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.964
But for some pretty complicated reasons
having to do with ripples in space time,

11:13.047 --> 11:14.632
we can only go as far back

11:14.716 --> 11:16.926
as the arrival point
of the most recent traveler.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.053
There's no do-overs.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.433
Anyway, now you know
why I've missed so much school.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.814
I appreciate your honesty, Trevor.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.526
I know you don't believe me.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.571
That's okay.
Neither would I.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.907
I still wanted to tell you
I was doing this to preserve your life,

11:39.991 --> 11:41.868
because you're a good person,

11:41.951 --> 11:44.287
and the director will just
have to find another candidate.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.003
- Philip?
- Over here.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.591
- Anything show up?
- No. Nothing yet.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.885
We've only got two potential hosts
for today.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.887
First one gets hit by a truck
here in about an hour,

12:00.970 --> 12:04.140
and the second one dies
streetside just before that.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.351
-These are the locations.
-Okay.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.644
You take that one, I'll take the other.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.687
Sorry, but what is our mission exactly?

12:09.771 --> 12:12.148
To greet Traveler 0014.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.110
-0014? That's a low number.
-No kidding.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.446
Why is the director sending back
someone so important?

12:18.530 --> 12:19.781
I'm hoping it's to help Marcy!

12:26.371 --> 12:27.455
Hey.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.457
Here you go.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.668
We gotta make sure we keep fluids in you.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.756
Yeah, that apple juice is really gonna
make all the difference.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.430
Sorry, I just...
I know you're trying to help.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.641
- That's okay. Nobody likes hospitals.
- Hey!

12:46.724 --> 12:48.518
That's not a very nice thing to say.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.645
How are you feeling?

12:50.728 --> 12:53.690
Uh, I'm... I'm okay.
I'm just tired.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.693
Can I...
Can I...

12:56.776 --> 12:59.779
- Can I go yet?
- Mmm. Afraid not.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.823
We still have a number of tests
we'd like to run,

13:01.906 --> 13:04.534
and unfortunately,
your MRI didn't turn out.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.160
What do you mean?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.496
Well, it's just that
if the scan was accurate,

13:08.580 --> 13:10.373
you'd barely even be able to communicate
with me right now,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.417
but it's no big deal,
we just need to do it again,

13:12.500 --> 13:15.169
and I'll put a rush on this one for you.
Don't worry.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.546
Everything else appears stable.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.799
So I will let you know as soon
as we get you slotted in, okay?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.635
Thank you, Doctor.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.011
All right.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.787
Look out!

13:53.583 --> 13:55.502
Damn it, Morrison, you were on that!

13:55.585 --> 13:57.712
<i>This is the list</i>
<i>of potential host candidates?</i>

13:57.795 --> 13:59.881
Not all of them, obviously,
but yeah.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.632
Then all these
people are gonna die?

14:01.716 --> 14:04.427
Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.928
I know this person.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.263
Shit.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.308
It wasn't my fault!

14:11.393 --> 14:12.810
Trevor?

14:13.895 --> 14:16.147
Trevor, where are you?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.900
<i>Trevor,</i>
<i>what the hell have you done?</i>

14:22.319 --> 14:23.488
There.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.367
That should do it.
We passed your time of death.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.576
You feel fine?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.579
Other than
the obvious discomfort.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.081
Good.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.208
Then it wasn't anything medical.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.920
Okay...

14:40.171 --> 14:41.923
Uh, what is that?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.759
I'm gonna take you back now.
You can claim a sick day and stay home.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.177
That doesn't answer my question.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.888
See, this is gonna erase the last
24 hours from your memory.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.140
To you, it'll be like you overslept
and none of this happened.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.600
And if I refuse?

14:52.683 --> 14:55.186
I'm afraid this is part of the deal
for saving your life.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.689
Not to mention, I told you a whole lot
of things no one can ever know.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.106
Okay, but so what happens next?

14:59.190 --> 15:01.943
You knock me out and you drag me
back out through the woods?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.987
You've been favoring
your side like it hurts.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.534
Stitches.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.329
I had some surgery the other day.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.414
Organ donor.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.834
Well, ow!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.544
Why don't I just walk back out with you?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.087
You know,
you don't want to tear those stitches,

15:21.170 --> 15:24.215
and it couldn't have been easy
carrying me all the way out here.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.136
Okay.
But I have to keep your hands tied.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.763
I understand.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.862
<i>Boss, you there?</i>

15:45.945 --> 15:47.822
Yeah.
Nothing's happened at my T.E.L.L. yet.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.949
-Any luck with yours?
<i>-No, nothing.</i>

15:51.075 --> 15:52.869
I guess that's one less candidate.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.871
No, I mean nothing happened.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
A crane dropped its load on the sidewalk.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.958
No one died.
No traveler arrived.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.127
You sure you had the time right?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.212
<i>It's possible</i>
<i>the historical record was off.</i>

16:03.295 --> 16:04.797
Some of my bets didn't turn out,

16:04.881 --> 16:07.424
-a few race results I'd memorized changed.
<i>-What?</i>

16:07.509 --> 16:08.968
Why didn't you tell me?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.803
<i>It was just a few races.</i>

16:12.847 --> 16:15.016
Boss, to be honest,
I don't think that's it.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.102
I think Trevor might have intervened.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.980
What makes you think that?

16:21.063 --> 16:24.441
<i>Back when I wrote all those T.E.L.Ls</i>
<i>on the front door of ops,</i>

16:24.526 --> 16:26.778
<i>he said he knew one of them.</i>

16:27.612 --> 16:28.821
Grace Day.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.575
No. No, Trevor wouldn't break protocol.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.203
Oh, shit.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.414
Okay.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.458
You look for Trevor.
I'll work on a backup plan for Marcy.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.047
-We need to talk.
-Carly!

16:46.130 --> 16:48.883
-What a... a pleasant surprise.
-Don't.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.511
Don't? Don't what?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.262
Don't do what you're doing.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.306
-Playing these games. They won't work.
-Okay.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.891
You're not gonna get Jeffrey from me.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.811
I don't have to take him from you
when you straight up hand him over.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.021
Look, you are manipulating
the wrong person!

17:02.104 --> 17:04.899
Jeffrey is my blood!
My son!

17:04.982 --> 17:06.943
And I could not be more serious
when I tell you--

17:07.026 --> 17:08.360
You're trash.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.905
What the fuck you just say to me?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.281
I said you're trash.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.617
And it's only a matter of time
before your son sees it, too.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.036
-You watch your mouth.
-Or what?

17:18.996 --> 17:21.833
You know you don't deserve to be a father.
You're a mess.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.919
And yet I'm the one taking care of him
while you bail for days at a time?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.046
Yeah, well, someone had to
make me feel like a woman.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.465
God knows you never could.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.180
You know,
when you're close to me like this,

17:36.263 --> 17:38.891
I can really smell what a failure you are.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.234
I see what you're doing.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.907
When will you learn
that I am not an idiot?

17:58.452 --> 18:01.998
You come to my work like this again,
and I'll file a restraining order.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.726
David?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.937
Can you get me some more juice?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.480
Yeah, no problem.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.900
Thanks.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.737
Just push that
if anything happens while I'm gone.

18:40.411 --> 18:43.915
Guys, get me out of here.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.667
They want...

18:45.750 --> 18:47.669
to run more tests,

18:47.752 --> 18:50.087
and if my MRI comes back
with the same results,

18:50.171 --> 18:52.173
they'll be doing experiments on me
till I die.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.134
<i>Philip, hack their database</i>
<i>and get my file, okay?</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:57.136
You got it.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.851
Sit tight, Marcy.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.187
Hi. I was called in
to speak with an Agent Forbes.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.439
Uh, Forbes is my partner.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.232
I'll take it from here.
Thanks, man.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.860
-Uh, come on in, Officer...
-Boyd.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.070
Boyd.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.115
You really need to stop making
a habit of this.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.826
Protocol 6. This is an emergency.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.452
Our medic's in the hospital,

19:21.535 --> 19:24.330
and her condition might be
beyond 21st-century medicine.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.623
The director will send help
if the intention is to save her.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.335
Well, help hasn't arrived,
and she's getting worse.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.420
And you're coming to me why?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.297
I just want access to your team's medic.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.882
No.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.593
Could you at least ask your medic,
let them decide for themselves?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.804
I just did.
I'm the medic.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.430
And team leader?

19:42.306 --> 19:43.557
Yeah.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.893
We lost ours along the way.
Someone had to step up.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.020
Well, then you, of all people,
should understand.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.690
We're just trying to do
everything in our power

19:50.773 --> 19:52.316
not to lose one of our own.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.028
Just have a look at her.
That's all I ask.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.914
- Hello?
<i>- David, I need your help.</i>

20:06.998 --> 20:08.708
We gotta get Marcy out of the hospital.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.501
Is that a good idea?

20:10.584 --> 20:13.254
<i>I wouldn't be asking, okay,</i>
<i>if this wasn't serious.</i>

20:13.337 --> 20:17.091
Well, she's... she's got doctors
and nurses coming in every five minutes.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.927
-I have a way around that.
<i>-Okay, look, I wanna help,</i>

20:20.011 --> 20:23.180
but you said so yourself,
this is exactly where she needs to be.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.224
Well, the situation has changed.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.644
If the doctors continue to test Marcy,
her cover will be blown.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.687
I don't care about her cover.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.564
<i>This is important work, David.</i>

20:32.648 --> 20:34.441
She told me she was dying.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.403
And I have no intention
of letting that happen.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.697
I have a plan. But the only way
I can pull it off is with your help.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.538
What do you need me to do?

20:47.621 --> 20:50.833
I need you to be in her room
at exactly 1:07 sharp.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.419
<i>-Can you manage that?</i>
-Yeah, of course, then what?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.837
Stand by.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.768
So why haven't you gone back
and stopped Hitler and Stalin?

21:08.851 --> 21:10.436
I love the way your mind works,

21:10.519 --> 21:14.398
but actually, we're only able to come back
to the modern age of computers

21:14.482 --> 21:17.234
because we need the precise time
and location of the host's death.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.444
Close doesn't work.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.948
-Then you're not really Trevor?
-No.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.991
You remember my concussion?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.035
When my consciousness arrived,
it supplanted his

21:26.118 --> 21:28.162
just before the last punch would have
killed him.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.372
Instead, I conceded the fight,
and here we are.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.791
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Grace, are you okay?

21:34.585 --> 21:36.838
Grace?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.802
Grace!

21:44.386 --> 21:46.430
Grace!

22:02.529 --> 22:05.157
Okay. Oh, God.
All right. Okay.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.287
Grace! Grace!

22:10.371 --> 22:11.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:11.873 --> 22:13.582
Grace! Grace! Grace!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.761
Stop! Grace!

22:40.484 --> 22:43.445
-Grace!
-0115, are you out of your mind?

22:43.529 --> 22:46.282
You do not get to change history
on your own!

22:46.365 --> 22:47.783
But I saved her.
How could you possibly--

22:47.866 --> 22:50.953
She made a phone call.
GPS, voice recognition.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.207
Oh, great, I'm bleeding.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.003
Been here less than a minute,
and already my body's damaged.

23:00.671 --> 23:01.838
Well?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.776
Knock, knock, Marcy.
It's time for you to head into your MRI...

23:24.820 --> 23:26.447
I am so sorry.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.618
-You murdered her.
-Oh, get over yourself.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.537
Historically, Grace Day died today.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.914
Don't get mad at me because
you got caught trying to play God.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.459
Well, candidates shouldn't be taken
after their T.E.L.L. has passed.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.712
It happened. It's forever.
So get over it.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.299
Are you here to deliver the repercussions?

23:45.382 --> 23:48.927
No, I didn't jump here to spank you.
I have a mission to complete.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.721
If I can get this goddamn car started.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.016
Huh.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.768
Now what?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.730
Home lumbar puncture
is pretty unorthodox,

23:59.813 --> 24:03.359
but looks like it helped relieve
some intracranial pressure.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.069
What the hell did you do with the CSF?

24:05.152 --> 24:08.322
She made a serum to help stabilize
the neurotransmitter levels.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.782
Smart.
Kept you alive for this long.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.994
But you know it could only
buy you so much time.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.954
I know.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.790
Of course you do.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.792
You've known the whole time.
It must have been brutal.

24:23.754 --> 24:24.921
Okay, I can give you

24:25.006 --> 24:27.758
a neurotransmitter stimulant
I developed for a mission

24:27.841 --> 24:31.470
-that should help you short-term, but--
-Thank you for the second opinion.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.097
I wish it was a better one.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.059
What? That's it?

24:38.185 --> 24:39.728
That's all you can do?

24:39.811 --> 24:41.313
What about nanites?

24:41.397 --> 24:44.233
There are a number of medical traveler
teams capable of amazing things.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.944
Yeah, we know.
But that takes orders from the director.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.699
That should start working right away.
You okay?

24:52.783 --> 24:53.992
Thank you.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.420
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.423
The shot I gave her should help her feel
more or less normal for a little while,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.426
but... her neurons are still going
like fireworks.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.263
But, hey,
if the director wants her saved...

25:14.346 --> 25:16.807
-Yeah. Thanks.
-You're welcome.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.232
Check in with your team.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.525
Why?

25:26.608 --> 25:30.737
Because I'm also on a mission
to locate 0014,

25:30.821 --> 25:32.406
and by now,
they should have his coordinates.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.950
They were sent a messenger this morning.
So check in and use this

25:35.033 --> 25:36.827
so I can hear both of you.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.833
Trevor, where the hell have you been?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.835
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I felt like I had to do it.</i>

25:44.918 --> 25:46.378
You broke protocol!

25:47.296 --> 25:49.090
But the new traveler showed up anyway.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.634
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.220
Is she 0014?

25:54.303 --> 25:56.388
<i>Oh, for God's sake!</i>
<i>They haven't located him yet?</i>

25:56.472 --> 25:59.433
If he didn't arrive after the messenger,
check the T.E.L.Ls from before.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.686
Why would the director order us
to greet someone who had already arrived?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.355
Who am I talking to now?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.150
Call me Grace.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.612
We share the same mission, Agent MacLaren,
and it involves Marcy.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.824
There's one potential T.E.L.L.
from earlier today.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.826
Uh...

26:17.909 --> 26:20.496
-A farm outside of town.
-Is that it?

26:20.579 --> 26:21.622
Obviously.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.040
<i>Send us the coordinates</i>
<i>and meet us there with your whole team.</i>

26:26.877 --> 26:29.004
Here.

26:32.674 --> 26:34.050
Philip, follow when you can.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.636
Carly?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.012
You're with me.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.335
Come on, 014.
Open the damn door. It's safe!

27:08.419 --> 27:10.086
My name's Ellis!
Get off my property!

27:10.171 --> 27:12.256
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-What about the kid?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.758
He's nobody! Come on.
We don't have much time.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.014
Why should I trust you?

27:21.097 --> 27:24.726
'Cause without me, you'd still be writing
shitty script prompts in a leaky dome

27:24.810 --> 27:28.605
like the grumpy, no imagination,
old bastard you are.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.779
027.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.781
I'd recognize that tone in any century.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.326
-Call me Grace.
-You here to hide, too?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.369
Partly.
Your defenses are up?

27:42.453 --> 27:44.246
With you? Always.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.458
Got 'em up just after feeding the pigs.

27:47.541 --> 27:51.127
- I got pigs!
- Okay. I want your code.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.547
What makes you think
I'm gonna give it to ya?

27:56.633 --> 27:58.260
And you are?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.511
Trevor.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.682
You look like somebody
shot your puppy, Trevor.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.559
Do I?

28:05.642 --> 28:07.311
She's not a real people person,

28:07.394 --> 28:09.480
but her heart's in the right place.
You'll see.

28:10.564 --> 28:11.565
Come on in.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.993
All right. Come on. Get in here.

28:33.879 --> 28:35.631
So, how'd you find me?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.758
My team did.
They'll be here soon.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.175
Your reinforcements.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.844
014 needs protection.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.929
He wrote a backdoor hack
that a faction in the future

28:43.013 --> 28:45.015
is desperate to get their hands on.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.517
What faction?

28:46.600 --> 28:49.895
A group is trying to topple the director,
and they wanna use my code to do it.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.814
-I came here to hide it, so it's useless.
-Not useless.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.401
How's it gonna help you
in the 21st?

28:55.484 --> 28:57.193
I'm trying to save somebody's life.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.403
Hmm.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.696
Is that so hard to believe?

28:59.780 --> 29:01.740
- Yes.
- Definitely!

29:03.367 --> 29:06.453
I made a mistake
that needs to be corrected.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.789
Hacker with a heart of gold.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.166
You're programmers.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.836
-This one's the director's favorite.
-Only when you're not around.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.340
-So how's my code gonna save a life?
-You'll see.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.802
And don't worry.
I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.637
Wait. You need it now?

29:24.596 --> 29:27.474
I was just gonna start on supper.

29:27.558 --> 29:30.561
Oh, he can do that.
Do you know how to prepare food?

29:30.644 --> 29:31.812
Yeah, sure.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.440
Well, hurry up.
I haven't eaten in centuries.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.955
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Special Agent Grant MacLaren.</i>

29:50.038 --> 29:51.748
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

29:51.832 --> 29:54.835
Agent MacLaren, it's, uh, David Mailer.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.463
I really stuck my neck out
back at the hospital,

29:57.546 --> 29:59.965
and I'll probably run into
some of these people again,

30:00.048 --> 30:02.343
and now I'm just waiting
on a Marcy update,

30:02.426 --> 30:03.802
so I'm not gonna lie to you...

30:04.845 --> 30:06.347
Feel a little pissed off.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.226
Which isn't to say that I'm unwilling
to help, obviously I am,

30:11.310 --> 30:15.021
but there's a difference between
helping someone and being used by someone.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.733
So, call me back.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.532
Trevor?

30:26.533 --> 30:27.659
Trevor?

30:51.892 --> 30:53.644
Who is it?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.061
3468.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.231
I received a message
to greet Traveler 0014.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.568
Well, then...

31:01.652 --> 31:02.653
greetings!

31:02.736 --> 31:05.572
- Uh...
- And you! Greetings!

31:08.659 --> 31:09.993
So what's the mission?

31:10.076 --> 31:11.578
You tell me.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.124
We just told you.
Our mission was to greet you.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.126
Then mission accomplished.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.335
You folks hungry?

31:19.420 --> 31:21.463
Your friend's cooking supper,
though I think

31:21.547 --> 31:23.549
he was expecting a couple more.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.051
Yeah, they're on the way.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.678
Finally. Where is she?

31:29.345 --> 31:30.764
You must be Grace.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.198
What's going on?

31:48.281 --> 31:50.366
There's a plan you need to be aware of.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.827
These two are programmers.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.413
They want to try
an experimental procedure on you.

31:55.539 --> 31:56.832
What sort of procedure?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.375
Well, they say it could correct
your condition.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.003
Table isn't gonna
set itself, folks.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.630
Grace wants to talk to you.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.512
Over here, Marcy.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.519
Uh, my team said you think
you can help me?

32:17.603 --> 32:19.605
Well, Marcy, nice to meet you.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.733
Just give me one second here.
I'm almost done.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.069
There we go.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.153
Sit.

32:32.743 --> 32:37.623
How conversant are you
with the theory of quantum entanglement?

32:38.624 --> 32:41.793
Um, I know it's the basis
of how we transfer consciousness.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.881
And in order for that to happen,
an alignment has to occur.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.424
Unforgiving precision.

32:48.509 --> 32:52.303
A misfire will kill
the incoming consciousness.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.891
We need to be 100% locked in.

33:17.453 --> 33:20.206
That's great, Marcy. Thanks.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.332
What was that?

33:21.416 --> 33:24.085
Oh, just a calibration test of sorts.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.546
Now, let's eat!

33:37.015 --> 33:39.726
Not only was I part
of the programming group,

33:39.810 --> 33:42.521
I was the team lead
on the social media research.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.065
You found the host candidates?

33:45.148 --> 33:46.191
Yes.

33:46.274 --> 33:49.110
The early successes made us
overconfident in our analysis,

33:49.194 --> 33:51.530
so when we came to Marcy's host...

33:52.823 --> 33:53.990
What's this one again?

33:54.074 --> 33:55.325
Carrot.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.869
- Carrot.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.080
This is spaghetti squash.

34:01.081 --> 34:04.626
My host has a refrigerator full
of something called bacon.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.504
When I realized what it was,
I cried for a good five minutes.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.006
You would.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.800
Where was I?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.885
You were saying
how you got Marcy's life wrong.

34:13.969 --> 34:17.180
Oh, right. Well, I can't tell you
how much I regret that, Marcy.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.559
Uh, people make mistakes.
I understand.

34:20.642 --> 34:23.436
But you don't understand
how I intend to fix it.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.105
No. I don't.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.192
By repackaging your original upload

34:29.275 --> 34:32.863
in order to bypass the damaged
areas in your host brain.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.615
It really is brilliant.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.825
How does this process
not lose information?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.494
Oh, it does.
Of course it does.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.954
I had to prioritize.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.874
A few memories,
some life experiences will be lost,

34:43.957 --> 34:45.876
but the human mind is full
of useless things.

34:45.959 --> 34:47.919
You won't even be able
to tell the difference.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.255
What about all my memories of the 21st?

34:50.338 --> 34:53.091
Well, obviously none of that.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.260
I didn't have access to it, did I?

34:57.137 --> 35:00.974
Just think about this
as a reboot of the original.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.810
A reboot? What will happen
to her current consciousness?

35:03.894 --> 35:06.396
- Same thing that always happens.
- It'll get overwritten.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.858
- You mean she'll die.
- It will be her.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.694
By any reasonable definition,
she will be Marcy.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.988
Just not... this one.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.696
I should have told you.

35:55.779 --> 35:59.532
Would it have made
a difference?

35:59.616 --> 36:01.284
No.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.662
Was it ever a threat
to the mission?

36:03.745 --> 36:05.288
I don't think so.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.293
Privacy might not exist
where we come from,

36:10.376 --> 36:12.628
but it does in the 21st, so...

36:14.464 --> 36:16.632
Thank you.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.301
And really,
what kind of an asshole would I be

36:18.384 --> 36:20.011
if I started yelling at you now?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.936
We'll brief you after the transition,
in detail.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.688
Philip will remember everything.

36:30.939 --> 36:33.024
No. Not everything.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.612
I'm not the same person today
as when I arrived.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.115
Doesn't matter how long ago it was.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.200
It might as well have been centuries.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.745
In a way, it was.

36:46.788 --> 36:50.250
You can tell her events and missions,

36:50.333 --> 36:54.295
and everything you can think of
in the most minute detail, but...

36:56.798 --> 36:59.217
you can't tell her...

37:01.469 --> 37:02.553
What?

37:05.098 --> 37:07.183
-Doesn't matter.
-Why do you say "her"?

37:07.267 --> 37:10.103
Because she won't be me.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.397
She won't remember...

37:12.480 --> 37:14.775
the most important part of who I am now.

37:18.820 --> 37:23.241
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to know
what makes us who we are.

37:24.993 --> 37:28.413
But I gotta figure it's more
than just the sum of what we remember.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.792
Yeah, you're right.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.628
And I won't lie to you.

37:35.711 --> 37:38.714
You're important to us,
and I don't wanna lose you.

37:38.799 --> 37:40.716
I'm really just...

37:40.801 --> 37:43.261
one person on one team.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.721
That happens to be here to save the world.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.683
So there's that.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.361
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.554
Oh, there she is.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.475
- What if I don't go through with it?
- What?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.854
What if I refuse the procedure?

38:34.645 --> 38:37.565
Why wouldn't you go through with it?
You'll die horribly.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.651
Don't I have the right to die
on my own terms?

38:40.735 --> 38:41.820
No.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.447
Do you have any idea
the trouble I've gone through?

38:44.530 --> 38:47.283
And I'm grateful for that, I'm humbled
by it, but I'm asking the question,

38:47.367 --> 38:48.869
-is it an option?
-No.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.536
I think it is.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.002
You have a responsibility
to the grand plan.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.711
You've taken an oath.

39:02.548 --> 39:04.592
Can I just...

39:04.675 --> 39:08.054
have the time to go home
and think about it?

39:08.847 --> 39:09.973
Home.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.978
It's important to me that I see someone
before I make this decision.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.733
Fine.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.195
Thank you.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.072
Come on.
We'll take you.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.012
Well, that didn't go as planned.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.140
Are you sure we're safe here?

39:52.223 --> 39:55.101
-Uh, I've taken measures.
-Well, will they be enough?

39:55.185 --> 39:56.978
I also got a shotgun.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.886
Thanks for coming in.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.763
I just didn't really want to be
alone right now.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.182
Of course.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.061
David will be home soon,

40:38.144 --> 40:40.730
so I'll just go make some tea
while we wait.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.984
I'll give you a hand.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.492
I'm gonna give her a hand, too.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.754
What the hell did she say to you
to make you consider

41:04.837 --> 41:07.048
not having a medic on our team?

41:07.132 --> 41:09.717
She didn't have to.
I know what she's going through.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.594
Do you?

41:11.677 --> 41:14.139
What happened
to "the mission comes first"?

41:14.222 --> 41:17.142
She just needs a little time.
I'm sure she'll make the right decision.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.477
You shouldn't have given her the choice.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.521
It's a little more complicated
than that, Carly.

41:21.604 --> 41:22.938
Look around.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.191
She has a life in the 21st.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.195
We all do.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.367
Some of us have made sacrifices

41:34.450 --> 41:38.579
in order to do what we came here to do.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.082
This isn't about
any one person's happiness.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.250
Tell me.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.669
What is it about?

41:56.556 --> 41:58.641
I have
a unique perspective on this.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.019
In the early days
of testing the technology,

42:01.102 --> 42:04.730
my much younger consciousness was
transferred out of my body and back again.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.567
That's not really the same thing.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.360
You still had your memories.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.279
It was ages ago.
Who can remember?

42:11.362 --> 42:14.115
My point is,
I was still me when I returned.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.825
I didn't feel any different.

42:17.452 --> 42:18.953
Neither will she.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.831
"She"?

42:21.914 --> 42:23.583
You'll be the same person, Marcy.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.754
So everyone keeps saying.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.257
My perspective
is entirely selfish.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.801
I just don't want to lose you.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.262
All I know is...

42:37.638 --> 42:39.640
I just need to talk to David first.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.185
I didn't realize you had someone
that important to you in your life.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.686
Neither did I.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.151
I mean, obviously I can't tell him
what I have to choose, but I think...

42:50.235 --> 42:52.112
just...

42:52.195 --> 42:54.155
sitting down and...

42:57.742 --> 42:59.410
Marcy?

43:06.876 --> 43:08.586
Marcy!

43:28.481 --> 43:29.690
No!

43:35.488 --> 43:38.073
- Marcy! Stand down.
- We're your team.

43:38.158 --> 43:40.410
This isn't
where I'm supposed to be.

43:40.493 --> 43:42.077
We know. You're safe.

43:42.162 --> 43:43.454
What's going on?

43:43.538 --> 43:45.873
This isn't your original T.E.L.L.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.335
Traveler 3569.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.756
Welcome to the 21st.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.774
Marcy?

44:15.486 --> 44:17.738
-Agent MacLaren?
-Hey, David.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.033
What's happening?

44:25.455 --> 44:26.456
Thank God.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.916
I thought something terrible
had happened to you.

44:31.126 --> 44:32.712
You must be David.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.756
I'm told we're close.
