it's a holiday.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.422

03:24.104 --> 03:27.174
Uh, LAPD just called us in
on a kidnapping.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.243
A 6-year-old girl
and her father

03:29.243 --> 03:30.411
were abducted from their home
this morning,

03:30.411 --> 03:31.879
but the CARD Team
isn't answering.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.113
Jansen is in Boca
with his family.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.382
We can try calling in
his guys.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.450
No. Missing 6-year-old?
Every second is crucial.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.718
We're working it.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.752
Get Carter and Simone
in here right away.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.223
Spill it. Right now.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.458
Mom...

03:46.760 --> 03:48.128
...Billie bombed
her midterms.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.730
That's not
how we rehearsed it.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.365
Whoa, whoa.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.601
Why am I just now
hearing about this?

03:53.601 --> 03:56.103
Well, Mom,
you don't understand--
No, <i>y</i> don't understand!

03:56.103 --> 03:57.905
You got all the time
in the world

03:57.905 --> 04:00.808
to make these ClipTalk videos,
but not enough time to study?

04:00.808 --> 04:03.043
Little girl,
we sacrificed way too much

04:03.043 --> 04:04.812
to get you in that school
for you to flunk out.

04:04.812 --> 04:05.879
No, you're just
not listening--

04:05.879 --> 04:07.047
Because you're not
saying anything

04:07.047 --> 04:08.416
worth listening to!

04:11.719 --> 04:13.020
Hello?

04:14.988 --> 04:17.224
Yes.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.259
Yes, sir.
I'll be right there.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.295
I got to go into the office.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.630
Ma, it's Thanksgiving.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.798
Max, I know that,
but duty calls.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.500
I'll be back,

04:26.500 --> 04:30.003
and we gonna finish this
conversation, Miss Thing.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.975
What do we got?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.811
A kidnapping--
Daryl Young, 37 years old,

04:37.811 --> 04:39.179
and his 6-year old daughter, Lainie.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.181
LAPD is combing
the crime scene now.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.950
In the meantime,
we've issued an Amber Alert

04:42.950 --> 04:44.985
for the little girl.
Who called it in?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.287
Neighbors. Their doorbell cam
caught the whole thing.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.026
Damn.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.195
LAPD has airships
looking for the RV now.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.631
Any idea why this family
was targeted?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.833
No. Daryl's a widower,
works as a paralegal--

04:59.833 --> 05:02.202
LAPD airship spotted the RV
five blocks from here,

05:02.202 --> 05:03.704
parked by
the D.A.'s office.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.838
Get over there
and check it out right away.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.607
So let me guess--

05:06.607 --> 05:08.542
this guy works
for the D.A.'s office?

05:08.542 --> 05:09.977
Yeah, but no one's there.
It's Thanksgiving.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.346
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

05:12.346 --> 05:14.482
At least seven more,
because apparently,

05:14.482 --> 05:17.184
Novak Stepanov is
more important than your family.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.886
Not even close.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.621
I'll be in and out
as fast as I can.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.490
<i>If you make us late
to your mother's,</i>

05:22.490 --> 05:23.691
<i>I'm telling her
it's your fault.</i>

05:23.691 --> 05:25.192
We won't be late.
I promise.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.661
Good morning.
It sure is, boss.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.497
Not when you've got us
working on Thanksgiving.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.065
<i>I'm on Team Nicole.
Why does it have to be today?</i>

05:32.065 --> 05:34.001
<i>The office is closed.</i> Exactly.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.336
This has to fly under the radar.
We can't afford any leaks.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.471
Novak's about to
spill his guts.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.040
Barely in prison a year
and he's already snitching?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.042
They don't make bad guys
like they used to.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.512
In exchange for
sharing his knowledge

05:44.512 --> 05:46.814
of multiple
criminal enterprises,

05:46.814 --> 05:48.816
Mr. Stepanov's sentence
will be reduced

05:48.816 --> 05:50.918
to one year
minus time served.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.654
At that time, he will be placed
in witness protection

05:53.654 --> 05:55.423
in a city
of his choosing,

05:55.423 --> 05:58.526
where he will receive
a generous relocation allowance.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.860
How generous?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.871
That's a lot of zeroes.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.941
A little preview-- you are not
in a position of power here.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.409
Your client is
a violent offender

06:15.409 --> 06:17.277
convicted of a multitude
of serious crimes.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.780
If the information he provides
is helpful to law enforcement,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.682
we will work
on a reduced sentence.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.785
That is all, and I'm not
promising him anything

06:24.785 --> 06:26.286
until I get a taste
of what he's offering.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.456
And it better be good.

06:28.456 --> 06:32.192
Believe me, I'm about
to put on quite a show.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.804
FBI!

06:43.804 --> 06:45.305
It's okay, Daryl.
We're here to help you.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.474
Do you have my daughter?
No.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.308
You have to go now.
J-Just leave.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.577
I-If they see me with you,
they're gonna kill her.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.444
Who will?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.884
I don't know who they are.

06:56.884 --> 07:00.588
I never saw their faces.
Lainie and I got separated.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.623
T-They made me show them
the-- the security entrance.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.057
They took my badge.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.794
Boss, we got a problem
at the D.A.'s office.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.261
We need backup now.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.563

What do you got?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.673
First unit's in position
in the sixth floor lobby.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.675
No visual on the hostages
or clear IDs of the subjects.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.409
Second unit has secured

Sharp shooters
are getting into position.

Good, so, Novak Stepanov,
three masked subjects, huh?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.750
Yes, Novak was here
to turn state evidence,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.518
but clearly,
it was just a ruse.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.020
We don't have an ID on
his crew, but one of them

08:40.020 --> 08:41.488
was shot in the abdomen
in the exchange.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.323
Laura, Brendon, there's still
a missing girl out there,

08:43.323 --> 08:44.858
and if her father did
what their captors asked,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.093
there's a good chance
she's still alive.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.661
So go. Go find her.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.563
I checked the security log in.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.165

His wife is Angela Lopez.
She's a detective.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.172
Mid-Wilshire.
I know. I remember.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.241
We gotta tell her.
That may not be
a good idea.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.510
Too bad.
I already know.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.846
Angie, we are gonna
do everything we can
to get him out of there.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.180
Oh, I know, because
I'm gonna help you.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.448
Oh, absolutely not.
We cannot let that--

09:08.448 --> 09:10.450
Hey, I am not just
some anxious wife here.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.252
I am a cop who knows

09:12.252 --> 09:13.887

09:13.887 --> 09:15.623
Okay, Detective,
I am very sorry

09:15.623 --> 09:17.390
for what you must be
going through right now,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.292
but I'm gonna be very clear
here-- this is <i>our</i> case.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.528
You are only here to advise.
Do you understand?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.096
Yes.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.932
We're making contact in two
minutes. Everyone get ready.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.466
Come on. Go.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.478
Everything
off the hostages.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.813
Good.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.486
Hmm, they have snipers
taking roost as we speak.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.622
Close all the blinds.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.460
What are we
going to do now?

09:53.460 --> 09:57.164
You are gonna sit there, relax.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.900
Hey, try and keep the blood
inside your body.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.234
I'll take care of
the rest.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.936
Okay.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.739
Sorry for the interruption
to your, uh,

10:05.739 --> 10:09.176
holiday festivities, folks,
but we're going to be missing

10:09.176 --> 10:11.611
the turkey, stuffing,
and football.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.681
Hmm.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.316
Uh, take them back in there.
Watch them.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.119
Let's go. Move it.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.126
Please, I'm your lawyer.
I helped you.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.861
I shouldn't be here
with them.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.430
Honestly, you're a hack
that got me a lousy deal.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.765
You're lucky I don't shoot you
right now.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.467
Shoo. Shoo, fly.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.171
I have
an offer for you.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.639
There's a system
of abandoned tunnels

10:39.639 --> 10:40.674
underneath
the courthouse.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.175
That's how
they used to shuttle

10:42.175 --> 10:44.144
notorious criminals like you
to and from jail.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.446
I could give you
the access point.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.849
That's your ticket
out of here.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.284
Come on, buddy.

10:51.284 --> 10:55.255
If you know about the tunnels,
so do the Feds.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.526
Can't blame you for trying, though.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.494
Watch him!

11:15.675 --> 11:17.644
Dial tone. Okay.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.748
Ahh. Huh?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.751
We're dug in.
Feds will call soon.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.218
We'll go back and forth
a little,

11:25.218 --> 11:27.120
pretend to get to know
each other.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.392
How you doing, buddy?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.727
It's no big thing.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.931
Sorry.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.100
I failed you.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.170
No.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.373
Actually, yes,
a little.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.109
But don't worry.
I won't let you die here.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.046
Okay.
Here we go.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.917
Novak's House of Hostages.
How may I direct your call?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.351
Is this Novak Stepanov?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.953
The one and only.
And who are you?

11:59.953 --> 12:02.422
<i>FBI Supervisory Special Agent
Matthew Garza.</i>

12:02.422 --> 12:04.191
What's your end game here,
Novak?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.559
Quite simply, I'm going to
walk out the front door,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.628
and you're going to watch me
fade into the distance.

12:08.628 --> 12:12.532
But first things first.
I need something from you.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.367
You need something from me?
Okay. How can I help?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.569
One of my guys needs a doctor.
He's been shot.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.306
Well, if he's shot,
send him out.
<i>Not gonna happen.</i>

12:19.306 --> 12:21.441
Offer a medic
in exchange for--
My husband.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.476
Not gonna happen. Understood.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.813
I can maybe get you a paramedic,
but what do I get in exchange?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.981
You get
two sweaty deputies.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.219
Why are you
freeing the deputies?

12:32.219 --> 12:34.254
They're our most
high-profile hostages.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.389
Those testosterone twins
are wild cards.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.225
They'll try to be heroes
any chance they get.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.427
And their cop buddies
on the outside

12:40.427 --> 12:43.964
are sure to do something stupid
to save two of their own.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.600
So trust me,
better off without them.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.409
Send the medic up in 10 minutes
or I kill a hostage.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.745
Send me in
with the medic.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.147
You are only here
to advise.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.314
Then send me.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.283
I wasn't a part
of the initial shootout.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.518
They don't know
what I look like. Let me go.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.254
Can you doctor
bullet wounds?

13:07.254 --> 13:11.191
I aced the FBI's Operational
Medical Class, so yeah.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.929
No heroics. Understood?
Got it.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.264
You go in there
with the paramedic,

13:17.264 --> 13:19.132
you assess the situation,
then you come back out.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.700
You sure about this,
Simone?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.036
No,
but I'm going anyway.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.105
If I could get a message
to your husband,

13:25.105 --> 13:26.539
what do you
want me to say?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.775
Tell him he's still got
a pie to make,

13:28.775 --> 13:31.711
and that Jack and I are thankful
for him every single day.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.948
I'm on it.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.483
They promised me
as soon as they did

13:36.483 --> 13:37.851
what they needed,
they'd let us go.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.519
Did they
tell you anything else?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.688
Just that if I jammed them up,
I'd never see her again.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.690
Lainie is all I have.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.558
If I lose her--
Mr. Young,

13:45.558 --> 13:48.061
we are gonna do everything
we can to get her home safe,

13:48.061 --> 13:49.662
but we need your help.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.631
Okay. Okay.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.633
Now, we have the footage
of the kidnapping,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.835
which I know will be difficult
for you to watch,

13:55.835 --> 13:58.605
but maybe it could spark
a memory that could help us?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.474
Alright?

14:08.148 --> 14:10.884
Wait, wait.
That's Flimsy.

14:10.884 --> 14:11.985
What's--
What's a Flimsy?

14:11.985 --> 14:13.320
Lainie's stuffed rabbit.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.421
I didn't think
they'd let her take it.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.989
It has a nanny cam in it.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.324
That-- That that could
help us find her.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.525
Do you have access
to the feed?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.660
No, i-i-it's--
it's set up to connect

14:20.660 --> 14:22.395
to the Wi-Fi router
back at home.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.496
Those things have
a max range of, like,

14:23.496 --> 14:24.932
400 or 500 feet.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.433
But if we could mimic
the home Wi-Fi,

14:26.433 --> 14:27.534
we drive around
the right neighborhood,

14:27.534 --> 14:29.102
we can connect to it.
Okay, yeah.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.339
Um, do you remember
how long you were in the RV

14:32.339 --> 14:34.341
before you got to
the D.A.'s office?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.176
That can help us
determine a search area.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.179
<i>This is Cutty.
You know what to do.</i>

14:39.179 --> 14:41.548
Why is nobody
answering their phones?

14:41.548 --> 14:46.353
Daddy... I don't think I'm gonna
make it home for dinner.

14:46.353 --> 14:51.358
Um, but tell the kids
that I am...

14:51.358 --> 14:54.427
I'm so proud
to be their mother,

14:54.427 --> 14:58.798
and there's nothing they could
ever do that would change that.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.134
I love you, Dad.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.037
Simone,
this is Ricardo.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.073
A little nervous?
You're not?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.041
Nope.
We're gonna be just fine.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.409
Confirm the number
of hostages.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.078
You clock how many are
in Novak's crew,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.212
their weapons,
and ammo supply.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.881
Do you understand?
Good.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.116
Go ahead.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.804
Lower your weapons
or this guy dies.

15:47.614 --> 15:53.987
Why send two medics
for a job that one can do?

15:53.987 --> 16:00.493
Because one of you is
a Fed playing dress-up.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.531
And I know which one.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.637
Piss off, Special Agent.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.939
Piss off!

16:12.939 --> 16:15.608
This is some BS.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.809
Excuse me?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.878
How you just gonna assume
Pretty Boy is the Fed,

16:18.878 --> 16:20.447
no questions asked?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.682
I mean, that's sexist,
racist, and ageist

16:22.682 --> 16:24.284
all at the same time.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.054
I mean, why couldn't
I be an FBI agent?

16:29.622 --> 16:30.857
Are you?

16:30.857 --> 16:33.960
No, but I could be,

16:33.960 --> 16:35.895
and I want that acknowledged.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.566
I like you. You're fun.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.734
Now shut up.
Get inside.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.504
Let the dogs go.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.550
Allow me.
Oh. Okay!

16:57.550 --> 16:59.119
Don't be stupid.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.131
You're welcome.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.604
Alright.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.107
Alright, fix him.

17:21.774 --> 17:25.178
Hey,
my name's Regina.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.514
You mind if I take a look
at that wound?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.782
Let me see.
Let me see, let me see.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.884
Okay, okay.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.620
Hold that. Lean up.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.923
What do you think?

17:36.923 --> 17:39.058
I think he needs to
go to the hospital.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.627
This tourniquet
will stop the bleeding.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.530
I mean, it'll turn the faucet
off for about an hour.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.698
Baby, it's gonna hurt
like hell, okay?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.567
Arm up.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.238
There we go.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.244
You don't seem to be afraid, Regina,

17:57.244 --> 18:02.282
which I find equally
interesting but suspicious.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.816
Fear is a decision.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.418
If I let it control me,

18:05.418 --> 18:08.321
I won't be any help
for your friend here.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.826
So you are afraid?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.795
If I focus on the fact
that you got a gun in my face,

18:15.795 --> 18:17.096
then hell yeah.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.566
But if I focus on helping
this man right now,

18:19.566 --> 18:22.269
make this the most
important thing in the moment,

18:22.269 --> 18:24.103
I can do
what I'm trained to do.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.672
Where were you trained?

18:25.672 --> 18:29.108
I was a Combat Medic Specialist
in the Army.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.644
As a civilian,
I went to EMT school.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.913
L.A. is a battleground
all its own, honey.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.648
Tell me about it.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.917
What's your assessment
of my friend here?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.119
There's no exit wound,
which means the bullet

18:40.119 --> 18:42.455
most likely
mushroomed and fractured,

18:42.455 --> 18:44.491
causing a lot
of internal damage.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.460
If this man don't get
to a hospital, he's gonna die.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.329
Hospital.

18:51.498 --> 18:56.836
I need... hospital.

18:58.371 --> 19:02.209
If you leave,
it's a life sentence.

19:02.209 --> 19:06.379
Just another
kind of death.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.547
You still want to leave?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.549
<i>Da.</i>

19:12.185 --> 19:14.521
Am I driving too fast?
Nope.

19:14.521 --> 19:18.458
This is a Goldilocks pace--
just right.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.493
The router will connect
when the device is in range.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.329
Alright.

19:22.329 --> 19:27.300
So, um... these jaw-dropping
parties you skipped,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.869
are we talking George Clooney
level soirees or...

19:29.869 --> 19:31.170
Better.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.905
Shut up.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.574
If I do, I won't be able
to tell you who invited me.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.347
I'll give you a hint.
They're an EGOT winner.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.683
That is so cool.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.585
What's an EGOT?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.655
Hey, Matt.
What's your status?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.657
We are hunting
a stuffed bunny.
<i>Excuse me?</i>

19:50.657 --> 19:52.659
Lainie took her nanny cam with
her when she was abducted.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.261
We're trying to track it
using the Wi-Fi.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.363
I'll be damned.
You got a location?

19:56.363 --> 19:58.898
Uh, Daryl said the kidnappers
only went 10 minutes or so

19:58.898 --> 20:00.733
before taking Lainie out,
so we have a search grid.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.901
Sounds like a long shot.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.270
Well, right now,
it's all we've got.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.905
Find her, Laura.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.276
How's it going in there?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.378
My injured man
is coming out.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.745
Okay, well, have the medic
bring him out.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.914
Nuh-unh. No.
No, you get one of mine,

20:14.914 --> 20:16.983
I get one of yours.
I keep the medic.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.620
That wasn't the deal, Novak.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.021
It is now.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.425
Nice work.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.794
I thought negotiations were
about getting hostages out,

20:27.794 --> 20:29.596
not sending them in.
I think it's time for you
to go home now.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.431
Fine.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.266
She's not going home,
is she?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.601
I wouldn't.
Neither would you.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.936
You're right.
Go find out what she's up to.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.539
Detective, wait up.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.608
Your boss says go,
you say wait.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.042
Can't you Feds
make up your minds?

20:43.042 --> 20:44.377
Don't do it.
Excuse me?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.778
Whatever
you're gonna do--

20:45.778 --> 20:47.580
go jack up Novak's crew
for information,

20:47.580 --> 20:50.149
lean on his family, whatever
you're thinking, don't do it.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.784
Easy for you to say.
Not really.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.654
I just sent my trainee in there.
Her life's my responsibility.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.123
And my husband's is mine.
I can't sit here and do nothing.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.592
But that's all
we can do right now.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.127
And you running off half-cocked
will only make things worse,

21:01.127 --> 21:02.595
and you know I'm right.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.065
So, please stay.
I'll talk to Garza.

21:06.065 --> 21:09.502
If I do, I go in
when you go in. Got it?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.671
I know better than
to talk you out of it.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.039
Come on.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.849
Hey.
How's everybody doing?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.283
What kind of
stupid question is that?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.818
I'm freaking out!

21:25.818 --> 21:28.120
Well, try and stay calm,
'cause freaking out

21:28.120 --> 21:29.288
is not gonna help us
get out of this.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.923
Are you serious?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.124
None of us are
getting out of this--
Shut up!

21:34.861 --> 21:37.263
All of you.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.499
No problem.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.068
This has got to be stressful
for you, too, sweetie.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.671
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

21:47.474 --> 21:51.010
These folks look thirsty.
I-I know I am.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.512
You think you could
help us out with that?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.120
I'm Wesley.

22:01.120 --> 22:05.024
That's Leonard, Nicole,
and Novak's attorney, Julius.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.259
Hey. Regina.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.564
Julius is not on our team?

22:11.564 --> 22:13.332
Julius is on Team Julius.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.801
If he finds out
you're a Fed,

22:14.801 --> 22:17.169
he might use that
to get out of here.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.138
Your wife told me
to tell you

22:19.138 --> 22:21.908
you still have
a pie to make.

22:21.908 --> 22:26.345
She says that she and Jack
love you very much,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.448
and they are thankful for you
every day.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.522
He's the weak link.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.591
Thank you so much.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.360
What are you guys doing here?
We're still negotiating.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.895
One of my guys rode in
the ambulance

22:42.895 --> 22:44.263
with the subject
who got shot.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.532
He was delirious,
started rambling

22:45.532 --> 22:47.166
about what's going on
in there.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.268
He said all the hostages
are in one room, east side.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.670
My unit is getting ready
to breach.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.271
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, okay?

22:52.271 --> 22:53.440
This is a long game.
One we don't have
time for.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.607
This is our best chance
to breach

22:54.607 --> 22:56.075
with minimal casualties.
Minimal casualties?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.444
We can save them all, Paxton.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.845
Just don't go cowboy on me
right now.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.547
I'm doing it by the book.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.348
Save as many lives as possible,
that's the mandate.

23:02.348 --> 23:04.851
If we wait any longer, the intel
will no longer be useful.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.419
Just--
Matt,
you had your chance,

23:06.419 --> 23:08.254
and I have tactical command
of this operation.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.122
We go in 10 minutes.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.200
B unit's set.
Get ready to breach.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.236
No, still nothing.
Head towards 3rd.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.538
It's at the edge
of the search grid.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.139
Okay.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.808
So, um,
this EGOT person.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.210
Did you really turn
the invite down?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.279
Why are you so interested
in this?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.381
Well, tender age kidnappings
can be tough,

23:35.381 --> 23:37.383
even for the most
seasoned of agents.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.385
Figured we could both use
the distraction.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.820
So who is it?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.722
Oh, uh, nanny cam
feed's buffering.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.090
Wait, wait, wait.
It's connecting.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.625
Oh, my God.
I see her.

23:45.625 --> 23:49.228
<i>We'll be okay, Flimsy.
I promise.</i>

23:49.228 --> 23:51.397
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

23:51.397 --> 23:53.265
She's within 500 feet of us.
Stop!

23:54.601 --> 23:57.504
Two high-rise buildings
on either side.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.638
God, there's got to be
hundreds of units here.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.774
Okay, let's get LAPD to canvass.
We need to be stealth.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.643
If we make a scene,
it could jeopardize

24:03.643 --> 24:05.578
her chance of survival.
God, it's so
dark in there.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.014
I can't see anything.
Is she in the living room or--

24:08.014 --> 24:09.982
Oh, wait.
Someone's coming.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.951
<i>Yes, yes, Novak.
It's no problem.</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:13.753
<i>Anything you need.</i>

24:13.753 --> 24:15.454
Got a screenshot
of his face.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.189
Great.
Send it to Elena.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.526
She can run facial recognition
against Novak's associates.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.260
Maybe we can get an I.D.,
an apartment number.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.029
<i>I'm freaking out.</i>
Take a deep breath.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.296
You'll be fine.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.335
Judging by
your demeanor,

24:29.335 --> 24:31.003
you don't seem like
a hardened criminal.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.772
Yeah, you seem smarter than
Novak and the rest of his guys.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.140
What are you doing?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.341
You're gonna get
all of us killed.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.810
We're just talking. Relax.

24:37.810 --> 24:42.114
I can't see your face,
but your eyes tell a story.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.683
What kind of story?

24:43.683 --> 24:46.218
That you're kind.
And young.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.955
Baby, how old are you?
19, 20?

24:48.955 --> 24:51.123
18.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.059
This is a pivotal moment
for you.

24:53.059 --> 24:56.629
They could charge you with
a plate full of felonies--

24:56.629 --> 25:00.299
uh, kidnapping, extortion,
assault, attempted murder.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.635
Or I could offer you
a deal right now.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
Wait, you could do that?

25:04.537 --> 25:06.739
Man, you don't know
who you're talking to?

25:06.739 --> 25:10.877
This is the Wesley Evers,
the most powerful

25:10.877 --> 25:13.479
Assistant District Attorney
in the city.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.147
Right, y'all?

25:15.147 --> 25:16.348
Yes, yes.
Yeah, he's big time.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.317
Yeah,
I could hook you up.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.954
All you have to do is get us to
the tunnels via the back stairs.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.326
You're trying to
mess with my head.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.895
Maybe I should talk
to Novak.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.497
You do that and you'll be
in prison forever.

25:31.497 --> 25:32.599
Is that what you want?

25:32.599 --> 25:34.366
No!

25:47.513 --> 25:50.349
So if I help you escape,
I get off scot-free?

25:50.349 --> 25:54.053
No, but you get
a reduced sentence--

25:54.053 --> 25:56.022
a cell safe
from Novak's reach.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.362
I also need an apartment
when I get out.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.598
Because I'm so sick of living
with my mom and her boyfriend.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.299
Yeah, I think
I could swing that.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.635
Government housing
is in San Pedro.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.870
Can we get that
in writing?

26:12.138 --> 26:14.774
Oh, ask for
a Maserati, boo.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.043
Once you're free, you want to
ride around in style.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.945
Yes, that. Okay.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.115
I promise that the D.A.
will do everything in his power

26:23.115 --> 26:24.717
to furnish you
with a Maserati.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.520
That is a sweet deal.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.591
Can we conclude
these negotiations?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.103
Good.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.205
Now come
and cut me loose.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.478
There we go.

26:57.516 --> 26:58.484
Good boy.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.258
I want you guys to go
down that stairwell

27:06.258 --> 27:08.194
and SWAT
will meet you.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.996
Hands above your head.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.831
You stay with them, baby.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.065
Okay.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.375
Yeah, come here.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.979
Here. Follow me.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.147
Hands up. Come on.

27:30.416 --> 27:34.086
Hold your nerve.
This isn't a bluff.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.389
Hey!

27:37.389 --> 27:39.325
Take another step,
we start shooting.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.328
FBI!
Don't move.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.631
So the square-jawed guy
really was the medic?

27:45.631 --> 27:48.467
See what happens when
you underestimate a Black woman?

27:48.467 --> 27:51.370
Drop the guns. Now!

27:51.370 --> 27:53.973
You drop yours.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.851

But I will be
after a stiff drink.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.439

Oh, I respect the bravado,
but negotiation time is over.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.564
No, it's not.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.804
Answer the phone.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.479
We walk
or the girl dies.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.823
Matt,
now is not a good time.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.991
Elena identified our
kidnapper, and we're about
to kick the door in.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.993
<i>Yeah, well, be quick.
He's holding her at gunpoint.</i>

29:22.161 --> 29:24.396
LAPD! We are in.
Go, go, go, go, go.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.564
Move, move, move!

29:25.564 --> 29:27.566
Cover left.
Clear!

29:27.566 --> 29:28.801
We're clear!

29:28.801 --> 29:29.936
She's not here.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.775
Stand down.
You can't give that order.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.644
You have tactical command.
The subjects are in custody.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.679
Matt has operational.
This is his call.

29:40.679 --> 29:43.249
And that baby's safety takes
precedence over everything.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.684
They walk.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.024
And the car keys
you took from Milos.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.765
A Prius? Really?

29:59.765 --> 30:01.300
You said
"inconspicuous."

30:04.503 --> 30:08.640
When we first spoke, I told you
I'd walk out the front door

30:08.640 --> 30:10.442
and you would watch me fade
into the distance.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.878
For now.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.779
But don't worry about it.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.182
We will find you,
'cause it's what we do.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.449
Not this time.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.618
If I even sense
that you are following me

30:19.618 --> 30:22.821
or hear a helicopter...

30:22.821 --> 30:25.691
that little girl
gets her angel's wings.

30:25.691 --> 30:29.661
Same thing if I don't call
my associate every two minutes.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.000
You drive.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.843
Doesn't make any sense.
Wi-Fi's still connected.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.178
She should be
within 500 feet of here.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.546
Okay,
just check the feed.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.515
He's on the phone again.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.417
<i>It's too hot.
The cops are everywhere, man.</i>

30:51.417 --> 30:53.352
<i>I need to dump her now.</i>

30:53.352 --> 30:55.021
Damn it.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.923
<i>I know just the place.</i>

30:56.923 --> 30:59.258
<i>Call you when it's done.</i>

30:59.258 --> 31:02.528
<i>Come on, kid.
We gotta go.</i>

31:02.528 --> 31:03.662
<i>No, Flimsy!</i>

31:03.662 --> 31:05.564
<i>Shut up!</i>

31:05.564 --> 31:07.733
Wait, look at where he threw it.
That's a ceiling.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.268
It's all piping,
no fixtures.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.736
They were never
in an apartment.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.438
They were in the basement,
headed to the garage.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.073
With me!
Let's go!
Yeah, let's go.
Come on!

31:22.748 --> 31:24.951
FBI!
Show me your hands!

31:33.759 --> 31:37.129
Oh, hey, hey.
Hands behind your back!

31:37.129 --> 31:38.430

No, I don't.

And it's hella sweet, remember?

31:59.952 --> 32:02.588
Yeah, I know, boo.
But did you read it?

32:02.588 --> 32:05.424

this deal will take effect

32:05.424 --> 32:07.393

that's you--

32:07.393 --> 32:10.462

of Novak Stepanov.

32:10.462 --> 32:15.334

so this... is invalid.

go to get those things?

the most in the world?

32:53.405 --> 32:57.276
Uh, uh, uh,
probably Nikola.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.445

of Novak's lieutenants.

and cover them.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.382
