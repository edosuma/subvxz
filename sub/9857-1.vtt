00:59.505 --> 01:04.420
It is with considerable difficulty
that I remember the original era of my being.

01:05.310 --> 01:09.850
All of the events of that period
appear confused and indistinct.

01:11.517 --> 01:14.621
A strange multiplicity
of sensations seized me.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.492
And I saw, felt, heard
and smelled at the same time.

01:19.591 --> 01:23.063
And it was indeed a long time
before I learned to distinguish

01:23.162 --> 01:25.870
between the operations
of my various senses.

01:26.932 --> 01:30.170
I remember a stronger light
pressed upon my nerves

01:30.269 --> 01:32.271
so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.

01:33.372 --> 01:37.047
Darkness then came over me
and troubled me.

01:37.643 --> 01:42.353
But hardly had I felt this when
by opening my eyes as I now supposed

01:43.048 --> 01:46.119
the light poured in upon me again.

01:51.356 --> 01:53.529
Okay. Hold on.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.277
So beautiful.

02:13.345 --> 02:14.914
You're a miracle.

02:17.249 --> 02:18.922
You're so beautiful.

02:27.326 --> 02:29.772
It's okay. Don't be scared.

02:30.496 --> 02:32.165
I don't think you can see.

02:32.264 --> 02:36.007
Unless it's very close,
it takes a newborn days to master that.

02:38.370 --> 02:39.506
He's alive.

02:39.605 --> 02:42.643
He's conscious. He's conscious.

02:43.609 --> 02:45.311
- Could this be muscle spasms?
- No, no.

02:45.410 --> 02:47.549
Look at the way he looks at me, Victor.

02:47.946 --> 02:50.683
Look at the way he looks at me.

02:50.782 --> 02:52.022
He needs water.

02:52.651 --> 02:55.655
I'm going to get you
a drink of water, yep.

03:03.428 --> 03:04.600
Open. Ah...

03:12.871 --> 03:15.010
Such trauma.

03:20.479 --> 03:21.648
Get him up! Get him up!

03:21.747 --> 03:23.116
He's alive!

03:23.215 --> 03:25.024
He's alive!

03:29.721 --> 03:30.961
It's okay.

03:33.859 --> 03:35.065
Shh...

03:39.198 --> 03:40.268
What?

03:43.969 --> 03:45.209
Let me try him.

03:46.505 --> 03:48.348
Try. Here.

03:48.574 --> 03:50.019
Be careful. Careful.

03:51.443 --> 03:54.447
Trusting that he has
the reflex of a newborn.

03:55.247 --> 03:56.282
Yeah.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.018
- Will you look at that.
- Wow!

04:00.185 --> 04:01.357
Okay.

04:02.387 --> 04:04.594
Very strong.

04:09.628 --> 04:11.869
He's very strong.

04:16.435 --> 04:17.436
Okay.

04:18.937 --> 04:20.874
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Here we go.

04:20.973 --> 04:22.043
I can't...

04:22.474 --> 04:26.445
- It's amazing. He won't let me.
- Okay.

04:27.079 --> 04:28.649
Okay.

04:28.947 --> 04:30.392
Hey, get up.

04:30.782 --> 04:33.987
- Okay, okay.
- This is it.

04:34.086 --> 04:37.067
Treat him like a mama. Like a mama.

04:37.522 --> 04:39.559
Yeah. Yeah.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.865
Okay, you can do it.

04:42.594 --> 04:43.834
Here we go.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.247
Good, good. Yeah.

04:52.104 --> 04:53.276
Yeah.

04:56.241 --> 04:58.016
Oh, my God.

05:01.647 --> 05:02.955
Oh! Oh.

05:09.788 --> 05:11.925
Yes, I know the mechanics.

05:12.024 --> 05:14.594
That doesn't explain
how you finally did it.

05:14.693 --> 05:16.331
I don't know, Dr. Marcus.

05:16.662 --> 05:20.767
Quite honestly, I'm quite overwhelmed
by the immensity of it all.

05:20.866 --> 05:23.904
- Oh, come on, Victor. Don't be so coy.
- I'm not being coy.

05:24.636 --> 05:26.573
I want to know what the breakthrough was.

05:26.672 --> 05:29.409
Well, it must have been something
quite wonderful. Brilliant.

05:29.508 --> 05:31.244
- But this is something far too important...
- Simple.

05:31.343 --> 05:33.046
...for you not to share
with the whole team, Victor.

05:33.145 --> 05:36.182
Now, I already noticed
that some applications are out of control.

05:36.281 --> 05:37.750
And what I was thinking was that maybe...

05:37.849 --> 05:40.453
So what? It just means he'll heal faster.

05:40.552 --> 05:42.488
Not necessarily.
Uncontrolled cell division...

05:42.587 --> 05:44.524
I'm not interested in your analysis.

05:44.623 --> 05:49.495
He's going to be healthier, stronger,
far, far more resilient.

05:49.594 --> 05:50.800
Okay.

06:02.808 --> 06:04.151
Administer the sedative.

06:13.085 --> 06:14.223
Yes.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.253
Look at you.

06:42.013 --> 06:43.253
Well.

06:44.649 --> 06:46.026
It's okay.

06:50.922 --> 06:53.562
There you go. Good.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.000
Yeah?

07:07.105 --> 07:08.516
That's good.

07:11.810 --> 07:12.880
Very good.

07:16.081 --> 07:17.719
Okay, so...

07:20.919 --> 07:22.364
Mmm. Yum, yum.

07:23.088 --> 07:24.089
Okay?

07:25.090 --> 07:26.501
Open your mouth.

07:27.392 --> 07:28.564
Like this. Ah...

07:29.161 --> 07:30.162
Ah...

07:30.662 --> 07:31.936
- Ah.
- Now.

07:33.598 --> 07:34.633
Ah.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.337
Okay.

07:38.770 --> 07:40.443
Ah... Mmm.

07:40.972 --> 07:41.974
Yum, yum.

07:42.073 --> 07:43.076
Okay?

07:43.175 --> 07:44.877
Ready? Ah...

07:44.976 --> 07:45.978
Ah...

07:46.077 --> 07:47.522
Good. That's it.

07:52.317 --> 07:53.387
Okay.

08:03.962 --> 08:05.365
Do you like that? You want it?

08:05.464 --> 08:07.705
Why don't you have that?

08:10.268 --> 08:11.269
Mama.

08:18.276 --> 08:19.277
Mom.

08:31.723 --> 08:33.430
Peekaboo.

08:35.660 --> 08:36.695
Good.

08:37.062 --> 08:39.099
And back.

08:40.599 --> 08:41.600
Brilliant.

08:45.804 --> 08:47.477
- Whoa!
- Oh!

09:00.852 --> 09:02.525
- Good boy.
- That's a good catch.

09:06.925 --> 09:09.132
- Fuck!
- Here. You okay?

09:09.728 --> 09:10.866
Yes.

09:15.534 --> 09:19.038
It's okay. You didn't hurt me.
It's fine. It's okay.

09:20.305 --> 09:21.943
Oh!

09:23.275 --> 09:25.044
Okay. You can let go now.

09:25.143 --> 09:27.647
You can let go. Let go.

09:27.746 --> 09:29.748
Let go. Good boy. Good boy.

09:43.194 --> 09:44.901
Yeah, I can see that, too.

09:45.897 --> 09:47.433
We're going to have to do a biopsy.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.041
Okay.

09:56.875 --> 09:57.876
Okay.

10:00.779 --> 10:01.917
Ready?

10:03.648 --> 10:05.252
That's it. That's it.

10:09.421 --> 10:10.593
I got it.

10:11.423 --> 10:12.959
Yeah. Good.

10:13.058 --> 10:15.538
Good. Good.

10:30.342 --> 10:31.377
Oh, no.

11:08.313 --> 11:10.384
I don't want to talk about it right now.

11:13.284 --> 11:14.456
I'm sorry.

11:17.656 --> 11:18.925
This is not what I intended.

11:19.024 --> 11:20.593
He can hear you.

11:20.692 --> 11:22.828
- He doesn't understand.
- Yes, he does.

11:22.927 --> 11:24.167
Mom.

11:25.664 --> 11:26.665
Look.

11:30.669 --> 11:31.909
Dad.

11:34.639 --> 11:38.610
They're just sounds. Crude sounds.

11:40.545 --> 11:44.317
Babies make them
and we ascribe meaning into them.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.052
Don't kid yourself.

11:46.151 --> 11:47.553
- Dad.
- Don't justify.

11:47.652 --> 11:49.825
He's a conscious entity.

11:51.056 --> 11:52.792
We can't just put him down.

11:52.891 --> 11:54.427
If we accept that he is conscious,

11:54.526 --> 12:01.102
then the concept of
prolonging his agony is unacceptable.

12:01.966 --> 12:03.703
We can't...
I can't have anything to do with this.

12:03.802 --> 12:05.645
I can't. It's...

12:06.538 --> 12:08.279
It'd be murder. I can't do it. I can't.

12:08.406 --> 12:09.544
Murder?

12:10.742 --> 12:12.178
Murder.

12:12.277 --> 12:13.779
What was that?

12:13.878 --> 12:16.916
He was never born. He does not exist.

12:18.249 --> 12:19.922
Look at him, Victor.

12:21.519 --> 12:23.021
Murder.

12:32.597 --> 12:34.873
Do you think that he's in pain, Victor?

12:39.270 --> 12:40.647
I don't know.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.081
Are you in pain?

13:50.508 --> 13:51.509
Okay.

13:57.682 --> 14:00.959
It's okay. You're going to go home now.

14:03.021 --> 14:05.001
I can't find a goddamn vein.

14:05.623 --> 14:07.296
The pain is going to go away.

14:10.328 --> 14:12.198
- Come on, Dr. Marcus.
- Wait a second.

14:12.297 --> 14:13.901
Now then, what have we got here?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.335
- That's all right. Leave it.
- All right.

14:16.434 --> 14:18.072
You're doing really good.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.410
Okay.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.653
It's okay. It's okay. Did you get it?

14:28.279 --> 14:29.682
No, not yet.

14:29.781 --> 14:30.850
- Now.
- Okay.

14:30.949 --> 14:32.053
Come on, Dr. Marcus.

14:36.521 --> 14:37.727
- She is gonna fit.
- That's it.

14:38.089 --> 14:39.291
- You did it.
- Okay.

14:39.390 --> 14:42.064
You did it. This is good medicine.

14:42.961 --> 14:45.441
Good. Good.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.032
- Good.
- Rest, baby.

14:48.299 --> 14:50.703
- Close your eyes. Just go to sleep.
- Start it.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.076
Close your eyes.

14:55.406 --> 14:59.479
That's good medicine.
Just relax and go to sleep.

15:02.513 --> 15:03.821
Go to sleep.

15:07.385 --> 15:08.921
Very good.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.626
And go.

15:25.803 --> 15:26.804
You ready?

15:27.405 --> 15:28.509
Uh-huh.

15:28.773 --> 15:30.548
- Yeah.
- Go.

15:31.809 --> 15:37.350
One, two, three, four, five.

15:46.224 --> 15:48.427
- Oh, my God.
- I'll do the rest. Hang on.

15:48.526 --> 15:51.507
- Okay. Okay. Please!
- Clear out.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.602
Oh, my God.

15:57.902 --> 15:59.506
Okay.

16:00.805 --> 16:02.512
Please, stop.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.480
Stop! Do something!

16:08.579 --> 16:09.815
I'm trying.

16:13.151 --> 16:15.153
Yeah, fine.

16:22.727 --> 16:23.696
Wait, wait.

16:23.795 --> 16:24.899
Wait.

16:27.432 --> 16:28.433
That's it.

17:10.775 --> 17:13.016
- You checked his pulse?
- Yeah, he's good.

17:56.921 --> 17:57.991
Oh.

18:00.658 --> 18:03.935
See? Victor fucked up.

18:04.395 --> 18:05.601
I'll say.

18:06.130 --> 18:08.567
Yeah. You can see
the cell replication issues.

18:08.666 --> 18:12.204
And I think the circuitry issues as well.

18:12.303 --> 18:14.010
Maybe next time he'll listen.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.146
I want you there more. Seriously.

18:18.910 --> 18:20.719
You know I want to be there.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.987
Here we go. All right.

18:24.382 --> 18:25.584
Hold on a second.

18:25.683 --> 18:26.923
You got him?

18:34.092 --> 18:36.495
Hey, give me a scalpel.
There's something wonderful going on.

18:36.594 --> 18:38.164
These eyes, look at them.

18:39.797 --> 18:43.267
Each one took six months to print.

18:44.902 --> 18:47.212
Billions of microlayers.

18:49.273 --> 18:52.186
I'm keeping these. Give me the scalpel.

18:52.710 --> 18:53.950
Scalpel.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.320
Wait, wait, wait.

19:01.419 --> 19:03.355
Let me section the cranium.

19:03.454 --> 19:05.657
That way you'll have
easier access to the eyeballs.

19:05.756 --> 19:07.326
Good idea. Yes.

19:28.117 --> 19:29.729
Get off.

19:36.254 --> 19:39.627
Get the fuck off him! Fuck off!

19:54.539 --> 19:55.609
Okay. All right.

19:56.807 --> 19:58.243
No, no. That's dangerous.

19:58.342 --> 20:00.012
That's... It's not a toy.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.513
No, no, no.

20:01.612 --> 20:04.821
No, no, no. Put it down.
Put that down. Put it down.

20:13.691 --> 20:14.860
No, no. You don't want to do this.

20:14.959 --> 20:17.906
No. I'm a doctor.
I can help you. Trust me.

20:18.996 --> 20:20.907
No, no. Stop! Help!

20:24.969 --> 20:26.880
Stop! Stop!

20:39.317 --> 20:40.352
You...

20:43.120 --> 20:45.191
You are magnificent.

20:47.425 --> 20:49.871
You have the strength of 10 men.

20:51.963 --> 20:54.034
You are the future, my child.

20:56.567 --> 20:58.240
You're the future.

21:30.167 --> 21:33.410
Dr. Marcus, please report
to Level 5 security. Thank you.

22:28.726 --> 22:29.727
Hey!

22:30.528 --> 22:31.802
Hey, you! Stop!

22:33.230 --> 22:34.937
What the fuck is that?

22:36.100 --> 22:38.239
Hey, stop! I said stop!

22:40.237 --> 22:43.241
Stop! You! Get down!

22:51.716 --> 22:53.919
Get down! Get down!

22:54.018 --> 22:55.622
Lie down! Lie down!

23:08.332 --> 23:09.572
Down.

23:10.368 --> 23:12.939
Get down.

24:03.454 --> 24:04.623
God damn it!

25:12.957 --> 25:14.061
Hey, stop!

26:39.443 --> 26:42.913
Here I lay, resting from my fatigue.

26:43.614 --> 26:46.618
Until I felt tormented
by hunger and thirst.

26:47.618 --> 26:50.599
This roused me
from my nearly dormant state.

26:53.257 --> 26:55.327
I staked my thirst at the brook.

26:55.426 --> 26:59.397
And then, lying down,
was overcome by sleep.

27:04.301 --> 27:06.247
It was dark when I awoke.

27:07.004 --> 27:08.881
I felt cold also.

27:09.673 --> 27:14.816
And half frightened, as it were,
instinctively, finding myself so desolate.

27:16.747 --> 27:19.853
I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch.

27:32.896 --> 27:35.934
I began to distinguish my sensations
from each other.

27:37.234 --> 27:41.273
I gradually saw plainly
the clear stream that supplied me with drink.

27:42.006 --> 27:44.577
And the trees,
they shaded me with their foliage.

28:40.230 --> 28:45.509
I began also to observe with greater
accuracy the forms that surrounded me.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.841
And to perceive the boundaries
of the radiant roof of the light

28:49.940 --> 28:51.351
which canopied me.

31:26.830 --> 31:30.101
One day, when I was pressed by cold

31:30.200 --> 31:32.646
I found a fire
which had been left by someone.

31:33.036 --> 31:36.347
I was overcome with delight
at the warmth I experienced from it.

31:37.007 --> 31:40.113
In my joy, I thrust my hand
into the live embers,

31:40.544 --> 31:42.751
but quickly drew it out again
with a cry of pain.

31:44.448 --> 31:46.484
How strange, I thought.

31:46.583 --> 31:50.497
That the same cause
should produce such opposite effects.

32:03.233 --> 32:04.869
Hey, Tom. You see that?

32:04.968 --> 32:06.379
Oh, yeah. Oh.

32:25.255 --> 32:26.461
Come back.

32:28.425 --> 32:29.870
Puppy, come here.

32:33.964 --> 32:35.102
Down, boy.

32:41.672 --> 32:43.276
Is this your dog, mister?

32:45.242 --> 32:46.653
Can I pet him?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.252
What's his name?

32:57.854 --> 32:59.424
Are you hurt?

33:03.694 --> 33:05.605
You should see a doctor.

33:09.433 --> 33:11.135
Will you play sticks with me?

33:17.708 --> 33:18.812
Come on.

33:20.844 --> 33:22.517
Puppy's so cute.

33:38.161 --> 33:39.469
Do you know how to play?

33:41.999 --> 33:44.809
Now grab your stick and throw it in
when I count to three.

33:45.335 --> 33:47.941
One, two, three.

34:07.724 --> 34:10.261
See, I win. Again.

34:14.898 --> 34:16.639
Okay, throw it in.

34:19.803 --> 34:21.874
Grab your stick and throw.

34:24.408 --> 34:25.580
No.

34:30.313 --> 34:31.485
Help!

34:35.585 --> 34:36.825
Help!

34:37.621 --> 34:39.794
Just jump in there! Go get her!

34:50.967 --> 34:53.470
Get out of the water.
Get out of the water now.

34:54.704 --> 34:57.844
Hey, Officer. We saw it.
He throw her in there.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.683
He's trying to drown her.

35:00.844 --> 35:02.482
Sir, put the girl down.

35:03.313 --> 35:04.849
Sir, I said put the girl down.

35:04.948 --> 35:07.952
Stop right there and put the girl down, sir.
I'm not going to ask again.

35:08.051 --> 35:09.654
- Hold it. Hold it, sir.
- Put the girl down.

35:09.753 --> 35:11.255
- Sir!
- Step away with your hands up.

35:11.354 --> 35:12.824
Sir, is this your dog?

35:12.923 --> 35:14.527
Hang on. Hold.

35:15.759 --> 35:17.568
Sir, is this your dog? Call your dog.

35:18.462 --> 35:21.136
Sir. Sir, control your dog.

35:22.199 --> 35:23.767
Control your dog!

35:25.068 --> 35:27.705
All right, let's take him in, okay.

35:29.172 --> 35:32.110
Sir, you're going to need to turn around
and put your hands behind your back.

35:32.209 --> 35:35.146
- Easy does it. It's okay. That's it, that's it.
- Nice and easy.

35:35.245 --> 35:37.851
- Nice and easy.
- Nice and calm. Here we go. Here we go.

35:41.785 --> 35:43.458
Jesus. Get off him.

35:59.035 --> 36:00.537
Stop it. You're hurting him.

36:02.672 --> 36:04.542
Jesus, help me.

36:04.641 --> 36:07.747
Mom, help me.

36:10.147 --> 36:11.616
Mom.

36:13.517 --> 36:15.155
Mom. Mom.

36:15.619 --> 36:17.621
Mom. Mom.

36:49.786 --> 36:51.459
- Come get it!
- Fuck you!

36:53.256 --> 36:54.633
- Kill the guy.
- Yeah.

37:25.622 --> 37:29.560
Fucking monster! You're a fucking monster!

38:01.725 --> 38:03.033
Who are you?

38:10.800 --> 38:11.801
I...

38:13.436 --> 38:15.347
You must have a name.

38:20.443 --> 38:21.820
Name.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.520
Name.

38:27.517 --> 38:29.758
Name. What's your name?

38:33.590 --> 38:34.933
Name.

38:36.926 --> 38:40.169
He seems to have
the mental capacity of a one-year-old.

38:45.135 --> 38:46.443
Name.

38:52.042 --> 38:53.282
Name.

38:54.477 --> 38:55.979
What's your name?

39:02.419 --> 39:03.898
Monster.

39:05.689 --> 39:07.168
Monster.

39:07.891 --> 39:09.097
Monster?

39:12.462 --> 39:14.464
Your mom and dad call you monster?

39:17.901 --> 39:19.505
Who is your mom?

39:25.108 --> 39:28.089
We found this on you. Is this your mom?

39:29.312 --> 39:31.115
- Mom!
- Easy... Hey, hey, hey

39:31.214 --> 39:32.249
Okay.

39:33.616 --> 39:34.959
Mom!

40:31.574 --> 40:32.746
Mmm.

40:45.722 --> 40:46.891
Mom!

40:46.990 --> 40:48.196
Mom. Mom.

40:48.691 --> 40:49.927
What's wrong with him?

40:50.026 --> 40:51.198
Mom!

40:51.828 --> 40:53.698
We'd rather hoped you'd tell us that.

40:53.797 --> 40:56.710
I'm sorry. I'm not a medical doctor.
I'm a research scientist.

40:57.233 --> 41:01.908
- You've never seen this man before.
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

41:03.206 --> 41:05.186
It would be very hard to forget him.

41:05.608 --> 41:10.079
Mom! Mom! Mom!

41:10.914 --> 41:12.650
Mom! Mom!

41:12.749 --> 41:15.923
Mom! Mom!

41:18.121 --> 41:21.534
Mom! Mom! Mom!

41:21.791 --> 41:23.928
Seriously, shut the fuck up.

41:24.027 --> 41:26.837
Mom! Mom. Mom.

41:31.768 --> 41:33.179
It's a fucking shame.

41:33.937 --> 41:36.440
Yeah, man. Bob just bought
a house in Calabasas.

41:38.007 --> 41:39.111
No shit.

41:41.044 --> 41:44.615
Yo, what happens to the mortgage
in this kind of situation?

41:44.714 --> 41:46.717
They give her
some sort of bereavement pay, right?

41:46.816 --> 41:48.052
Yeah.

41:48.151 --> 41:49.720
That ain't fucking shit, dude.

41:49.819 --> 41:51.922
They act like they give a fuck about us.

41:52.021 --> 41:53.466
They don't give a fuck.

41:54.390 --> 41:55.767
You listening to this?

41:56.593 --> 41:57.867
Fucking animal.

41:58.528 --> 42:00.007
Oh... Does that hurt?

42:01.297 --> 42:03.167
You fucking piece of shit!

42:03.266 --> 42:04.535
Fuck you, animal!

42:04.634 --> 42:06.837
- Yo, take it easy, Lenny.
- Fuck off, man.

42:06.936 --> 42:10.145
You know Bob's face
was completely fucking smashed in?

42:10.540 --> 42:11.542
Nothing left, man.

42:11.641 --> 42:14.378
His fucking missus had to go down there
and identify that.

42:14.477 --> 42:17.281
What the fuck is wrong with this thing?
A fucking freak show.

42:17.380 --> 42:20.361
He's a fucking Mongoloid, man.
He's a freakin' Elephant Man.

42:21.284 --> 42:22.922
But he doesn't know what's going on.

42:23.486 --> 42:24.789
Fuck you!

42:24.888 --> 42:26.526
God damn it. Would you relax?

42:28.258 --> 42:30.431
I'm fine. I'm fine.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.229
Just take a fucking breath.

42:32.328 --> 42:35.366
Just calm down. It's all...
Everything's gonna be all right.

42:35.465 --> 42:36.569
All right.

42:38.034 --> 42:39.672
Let's just get this done.

43:10.433 --> 43:12.470
He's a heavy motherfucker.

43:12.569 --> 43:14.505
- Put him on his knees.
- Why?

43:14.604 --> 43:16.140
I want him to see what's coming.

43:19.075 --> 43:21.419
Now, come on. Get up. Get up.

43:25.648 --> 43:28.185
Fuck you, you fucking scumbag.

43:28.751 --> 43:31.664
Fuck you! Deserve to die.

43:36.159 --> 43:37.297
Die.

43:39.495 --> 43:42.499
What'd you say? You want to die?

43:43.967 --> 43:46.379
- Die.
- You want to fucking die.

43:49.739 --> 43:51.082
Shut the fuck up.

43:54.911 --> 43:56.514
Come here. Come on.

44:11.761 --> 44:16.301
Mom. Mom. Mom.

44:16.599 --> 44:18.772
Mom? What the fuck are you saying?

44:19.268 --> 44:20.611
Mom.

44:21.337 --> 44:23.078
You want your mommy.

44:23.406 --> 44:24.475
Oh.

44:24.574 --> 44:26.010
Is that your mommy?

44:26.109 --> 44:28.012
Is that your mommy? Is that what you want?

44:28.111 --> 44:31.558
Here you go. Here you go.
There's your mommy. There's your mommy.

44:33.315 --> 44:35.785
Fuck you, motherfucker.

45:31.340 --> 45:32.580
You wanna go out?

45:33.810 --> 45:35.380
Do you wanna go out, honey?

45:49.759 --> 45:51.500
That's fucked up.

46:30.500 --> 46:34.346
Everything, everything

46:35.304 --> 46:37.511
Everything gonna be all right

46:39.142 --> 46:41.053
This morning

46:44.313 --> 46:49.387
When I was a young boy
About the age of five

46:50.920 --> 46:55.926
My mama told me
I was gonna be the greatest man alive

46:57.460 --> 46:59.667
I guess I am

47:02.465 --> 47:04.274
A child

47:09.305 --> 47:11.342
That represents man

47:12.642 --> 47:14.280
No B

47:15.711 --> 47:17.349
O Child

47:35.031 --> 47:37.375
I need my soul

47:57.854 --> 47:59.060

48:01.023 --> 48:02.161
Who that?

48:03.893 --> 48:05.497
What's your name?

48:08.831 --> 48:09.832
Huh?

48:10.066 --> 48:11.545
Welcome, friend.

48:14.770 --> 48:17.649

48:18.507 --> 48:19.476

48:19.575 --> 48:21.748
Well, it's nice
to meet you there, Monster.

48:25.648 --> 48:29.027
Yeah. Are you a friend?

48:31.120 --> 48:33.557
Hey, what is this? Oh, I see.

48:33.656 --> 48:38.028
They done fitted you for one of them suits
down at the funny farm, huh?

48:38.727 --> 48:41.802
Help. Mom. Jesus.

48:42.198 --> 48:45.202
No, no, no. Hey now.
I ain't none of those, okay?

48:45.301 --> 48:50.307
I mean, it seems like I've been fitted for
one of those suits once or twice in my life.

48:50.973 --> 48:52.111
Yeah.

48:53.042 --> 48:54.077
Huh?

48:54.443 --> 48:56.116

49:07.657 --> 49:09.364

Huh?

49:27.109 --> 49:32.320
Oh, yo, I see. You can't...
You can't talk.

49:34.650 --> 49:36.459
Well, I can't see.

49:37.820 --> 49:39.390
It don't matter.

49:40.556 --> 49:43.833
It seemed to me that you needed a friend.

49:45.261 --> 49:47.673
Friend.

49:48.731 --> 49:50.005
Friend.

49:50.499 --> 49:52.501
You're a friend to me, my brother.

49:53.602 --> 49:54.672
Yeah.

50:00.209 --> 50:02.314
A child

50:06.015 --> 50:08.723
That means maker

50:09.685 --> 50:12.990
No B-O child

50:14.256 --> 50:15.633
Y

50:16.559 --> 50:18.800
That represent mannish boy

50:29.872 --> 50:33.513
I led a miserable life in the strange
place where I found myself.

50:34.510 --> 50:37.354
Endeavoring to cure the wound
which I'd received.

50:38.381 --> 50:40.584
A bullet had entered my head

50:40.683 --> 50:44.529
and I knew not whether it had
remained there or passed through.

50:45.688 --> 50:48.760
At any rate, I had no means
of extracting it.

50:49.191 --> 50:51.967
Monster. Monster.

50:52.895 --> 50:55.466
Hey, hey. Is this red?

50:57.767 --> 51:00.907
- Red.
- Red. It's yours.

51:01.971 --> 51:03.314
Try it on.

51:05.041 --> 51:06.418
Here we go.

51:07.843 --> 51:10.483
Hey, hey, hey. Be careful. Be careful.

51:11.380 --> 51:13.360
Okay, put it on.

51:14.216 --> 51:17.129
Okay? Yeah. Huh?

51:17.553 --> 51:20.295
You're not going to
scare away any customers, huh?

51:20.756 --> 51:22.895
Yeah, a coat.

51:25.327 --> 51:26.465
Coat.

51:26.729 --> 51:27.799
Ah!

51:28.531 --> 51:29.976
Shoes.

51:32.068 --> 51:33.206
Shoes.

51:52.455 --> 51:54.662
Music good, huh? Awesome.

51:55.691 --> 51:57.432
I love the life

51:58.627 --> 52:03.235
I love waking up
and smelling what I can't see

52:04.567 --> 52:06.376
I can't see

52:07.670 --> 52:09.239
How you feel about me?

52:09.338 --> 52:13.150
I smell some perfume
so you must be going home soon

52:14.643 --> 52:16.680
Let me know
when something pretty comes by.

52:16.779 --> 52:19.089
Let me know when them tourists come by.

52:19.682 --> 52:22.595
...in my mouth is ringing right back there

52:28.324 --> 52:31.237
'Cause it's no joke to be a joke

52:32.161 --> 52:34.368
Watch out for the scallywags.

52:35.898 --> 52:37.801
Scallywags.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.277
Scallywag.

52:40.169 --> 52:43.006
Okay, are we okay?
I smell something. I smell something.

52:43.105 --> 52:45.745
I improved rapidly
in the knowledge of language.

52:46.442 --> 52:48.245
So that in a short while,

52:48.344 --> 52:51.723
I began to comprehend most of the words
uttered by my protector.

52:51.914 --> 52:53.083
Okay.

52:53.182 --> 52:55.652
Check it, check, it, check it.
I smell a dumpster.

52:57.186 --> 53:00.167
I smell a dumpster. Food. Food.
I smell a dumpster.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.862
I smell it. I smell it.

53:07.796 --> 53:13.576
Okay. Sometimes the restaurants, see,
they put out their leftovers and their waste.

53:14.069 --> 53:16.310
- Dumpster.
- Dumpster. Dumpster.

53:16.639 --> 53:17.640
Dumpster.

53:24.079 --> 53:26.389
Yeah. Get anything good?

53:27.082 --> 53:28.351
Huh?

53:28.450 --> 53:29.986
Anything good?

53:30.085 --> 53:32.689
Look for a box of food.

53:32.788 --> 53:34.927
What? Anything good? Huh?

53:36.091 --> 53:39.396
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?

53:39.495 --> 53:42.806
No. No. No. It's not good.

53:43.232 --> 53:47.112
It's bad. It's very fucking bad.

53:48.270 --> 53:51.144
One more. Yeah, vibrate good. Come on.

53:55.077 --> 53:57.182
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

54:01.483 --> 54:02.655
Ah!

54:09.258 --> 54:10.362
Mmm.

54:12.895 --> 54:14.533
Now this is good.

54:15.864 --> 54:17.601
- That's good.
- Good.

54:17.700 --> 54:18.872
Good.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.409
- Bad.
- You are the craziest motherfucker.

54:26.508 --> 54:28.112
- Very fucking bad.
- Huh?

54:29.945 --> 54:31.151
Hey, you smoke?

54:32.815 --> 54:33.885
Smoke.

54:37.586 --> 54:39.964
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

54:40.422 --> 54:42.698
It's a lighter for fire.

54:43.993 --> 54:45.370
Careful. Careful.

54:52.101 --> 54:53.205
Fire.

55:01.910 --> 55:06.683
When I could see... I used to be...

55:06.782 --> 55:10.662
I used to be, I used to be kind.

55:12.821 --> 55:14.596
And then I was blind.

55:17.826 --> 55:19.169
Sleep.

55:26.602 --> 55:27.774
Sleep.

55:55.898 --> 55:57.673
You want to go, motherfucker?

55:58.434 --> 56:00.436
You want to break, bitch?

56:08.377 --> 56:09.754
That boy's fucked up.

56:11.213 --> 56:13.159
Oh, friend, friend.

56:14.650 --> 56:17.754
I have available cars near 219
to transfer to Highland.

56:19.488 --> 56:20.831
How's his state?

56:23.759 --> 56:24.999
Stick an IV on him.

56:26.628 --> 56:27.732
Yeah.

56:35.471 --> 56:37.382
All right, what the fuck's going on here?

56:37.906 --> 56:39.743
Looks like they were flung right across.

56:39.842 --> 56:42.584
These aren't choirboys. Let's go.

56:53.255 --> 56:56.759
The strange system
of human society was explained to me.

56:57.860 --> 56:59.897
I saw the division of property

57:00.996 --> 57:03.442
of immense wealth and squalid poverty,

57:04.466 --> 57:07.242
of rank, descent, and noble blood.

57:08.270 --> 57:09.239
Hey, Monster.

57:09.338 --> 57:11.741
A man might be respected
with only one of these advantages.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.643
I hope you're checking out them ladies.

57:13.742 --> 57:17.918
But without either, he was considered
as a vagabond and a slave,

57:18.881 --> 57:22.192
doomed to waste his powers
for the profits of the chosen few.

57:23.619 --> 57:24.927
And what was I?

57:25.587 --> 57:28.830
Of my creation and creator,
I was absolutely ignorant.

57:30.125 --> 57:34.130
But I knew that I possessed no money,
no friends, no kind of property.

57:35.164 --> 57:39.369
I was, besides, endued with a figure
hideously deformed and loathsome.

57:39.468 --> 57:40.913
Hey, Eddie.

57:41.203 --> 57:43.073
Hey, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda.

57:43.172 --> 57:46.244
Was I then a monster?

57:46.809 --> 57:48.378
A blot upon the Earth?

57:48.477 --> 57:51.014
Hey, hey, hey. Monster? Monster?

57:51.113 --> 57:52.649
Tell me the truth.

57:53.115 --> 57:58.861
Is Wanda as fine as she sounds
or is she butt ugly like a dog?

57:59.488 --> 58:02.092
He's fucking with you. We're old friends.

58:02.191 --> 58:05.528
Yeah, but I ain't never
had nobody to ask before.

58:05.627 --> 58:08.938
Monster, tell me the truth, Monster.
Is she pretty?

58:11.400 --> 58:12.402
Huh?

58:12.501 --> 58:13.803
- Pretty.
- Hey.

58:13.902 --> 58:15.905
Hey, your friend has good taste, Eddie.

58:16.004 --> 58:19.142
Yeah, but is she prettier
than that girl across the street?

58:22.478 --> 58:24.881
How do you know there is a girl
crossing the street, Eddie?

58:24.980 --> 58:28.551
'Cause I can hear her heels
clickety, click, click, click.

58:28.650 --> 58:31.961
You know I'm prettier.
She's a nasty ass bitch.

58:33.655 --> 58:36.226
Prettier.

58:37.326 --> 58:39.028
- Prettier.
- Yeah.

58:39.127 --> 58:40.997
I'm teaching him how to talk.

58:41.096 --> 58:43.736
But he can't talk much. He's learning.

58:44.066 --> 58:45.238
Really?

58:46.935 --> 58:48.243
What's your name?

58:49.605 --> 58:50.974
Monster.

58:51.073 --> 58:54.885
Monster? Why are you hiding
in that hoodie?

58:57.913 --> 59:00.283
He's shy. I've seen some
scary-looking creeps around here.

59:00.382 --> 59:02.118
You can't look worse than that.

59:02.217 --> 59:03.252
Come on.

59:03.452 --> 59:05.363
Oh, yeah, he does.

59:06.088 --> 59:07.999
He certainly does.

59:13.929 --> 59:15.306
Honey...

59:16.698 --> 59:18.075
Are you sick?

59:19.768 --> 59:20.870
Is he contagious?

59:20.969 --> 59:25.076
No, no, it ain't catching.
I've been hanging around him long enough.

59:27.643 --> 59:29.122
Were you born that way?

59:30.379 --> 59:31.514
Born?

59:31.613 --> 59:34.253
Yeah. You know, when you were a baby.

59:34.983 --> 59:36.189
Baby.

59:37.185 --> 59:41.724
You know, like,
goo-goo, mama, itty-bitty baby shit.

59:41.823 --> 59:43.200
- Mom?
- Yeah.

59:45.627 --> 59:47.368
Monster, do you know
where babies come from?

59:51.433 --> 59:52.776
Does he know anything?

59:53.802 --> 59:55.782
He does. He does.

1:00:01.243 --> 1:00:02.517
Monster.

1:00:05.647 --> 1:00:07.126
Have you seen this shit before?

1:00:10.352 --> 1:00:11.854
That's fucking.

1:00:13.021 --> 1:00:15.023
Well, that's how babies are made.

1:00:15.657 --> 1:00:17.864
All my past life was now a blot,

1:00:19.328 --> 1:00:22.999
a blind vacancy
in which I distinguished nothing.

1:00:23.098 --> 1:00:26.978
From my earliest remembrance
I had been as I then was

1:00:27.803 --> 1:00:29.205
in height and proportion.

1:00:29.304 --> 1:00:31.944
I don't think he's ever been with a woman.

1:00:32.708 --> 1:00:35.945
Okay, well, I ain't giving no mercy fuck.

1:00:36.044 --> 1:00:37.881
I mean, he's sweet and all
but he's got some serious problems.

1:00:37.980 --> 1:00:39.254
What did this mean?

1:00:40.382 --> 1:00:43.219
Who was I? What was I?

1:00:43.318 --> 1:00:45.889
You don't have that kind of money, Eddie.

1:00:45.988 --> 1:00:47.467
Whence did I come?

1:00:50.459 --> 1:00:52.562
What was my destination?

1:00:52.661 --> 1:00:55.232
Monster, is that shit all over your body?

1:00:57.966 --> 1:01:00.173
When did you last take a bath?

1:01:01.003 --> 1:01:04.908
Wanda, Wanda, all you got to do is take him
to a room and scrub him down.

1:01:05.007 --> 1:01:07.180
A room? You got money for that, too?

1:01:08.110 --> 1:01:11.347
I'll tell you what. I've got $100.

1:01:11.446 --> 1:01:13.323
And that includes room and everything.

1:01:15.283 --> 1:01:16.455
Thank you.

1:01:17.786 --> 1:01:19.129
All right.

1:01:21.089 --> 1:01:23.660
- Don't forget. Yeah.
- Here you go.

1:01:23.759 --> 1:01:25.862
Don't you worry about a thing, okay?

1:01:25.961 --> 1:01:29.032
Wanda's going to walk you
through the ropes, up and down.

1:01:29.131 --> 1:01:31.577
- It's all right. Monster.
- Come on.

1:01:34.236 --> 1:01:35.238
Come on.

1:01:35.337 --> 1:01:37.774
- Take him by the hand, into the water.
- There you go.

1:01:37.873 --> 1:01:39.352
Take him to the water.

1:01:39.641 --> 1:01:40.643
Whoa!

1:01:40.742 --> 1:01:42.812
What color dress you got there, Monster?

1:01:42.911 --> 1:01:43.981
Red.

1:01:44.813 --> 1:01:47.157
Monster, have fun.

1:02:06.001 --> 1:02:07.002
What's this?

1:02:10.939 --> 1:02:13.476
- Pretty.
- Yeah, she is.

1:02:14.009 --> 1:02:15.478
Ugly.

1:02:15.577 --> 1:02:17.147
You are. Yeah.

1:02:24.219 --> 1:02:25.289
What?

1:02:28.857 --> 1:02:30.359
Fucking.

1:02:31.059 --> 1:02:32.470
Oh, honey, I'll fuck you.

1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:40.407
Oh, you want to fuck her?

1:02:44.072 --> 1:02:45.676
Yes.

1:02:46.274 --> 1:02:50.552
Well, she ain't here and I am.

1:02:51.313 --> 1:02:55.921
Well, she ain't putting out and I am,
so what do you say?

1:03:08.864 --> 1:03:10.275
Do you love her?

1:03:12.234 --> 1:03:14.145
- Love?
- Yeah.

1:03:16.238 --> 1:03:19.014
Like, do you think about her all the time?

1:03:20.342 --> 1:03:21.912
You know, dream about her?

1:03:22.978 --> 1:03:23.946
Dream.

1:03:24.045 --> 1:03:25.786
Like, pictures in your head?

1:03:29.885 --> 1:03:32.488
Like this. See?

1:03:32.587 --> 1:03:34.965
Pictures in your head when you sleep.

1:03:38.593 --> 1:03:39.799
Dream.

1:03:43.165 --> 1:03:45.042
- Dream.
- Yeah.

1:03:53.542 --> 1:03:54.677
Love.

1:03:56.311 --> 1:03:57.654
Yeah.

1:04:00.248 --> 1:04:02.418
You're so sweet, Monster.

1:04:04.386 --> 1:04:05.456
Do you want me to Google her?

1:04:15.197 --> 1:04:16.540
Is that her?

1:04:25.006 --> 1:04:26.417
You know her?

1:04:55.070 --> 1:04:57.550
Okay. No, no, no. Okay.

1:04:59.641 --> 1:05:00.710
You are sweet and all,

1:05:00.809 --> 1:05:05.656
but you really, really got to take a shower
before we can do anything, okay?

1:05:39.948 --> 1:05:41.154
Come on.

1:05:47.989 --> 1:05:48.990
My...

1:05:54.396 --> 1:05:56.398
Eddie doesn't know, does he?

1:05:59.567 --> 1:06:01.444
He can't see how bad it is.

1:06:03.538 --> 1:06:04.744
Bad.

1:06:07.375 --> 1:06:08.820
Sorry, honey...

1:06:10.612 --> 1:06:11.955
But I can't.

1:06:14.349 --> 1:06:16.852
I knew you were a bum,
but I thought you were a man.

1:06:20.422 --> 1:06:22.325
You don't even look human.

1:06:22.424 --> 1:06:23.698
Love.

1:06:24.559 --> 1:06:28.664
I will personally cover the hotel room.
I'll refund the money, okay?

1:06:28.763 --> 1:06:29.932
Love.

1:06:30.031 --> 1:06:32.235
Get the fuck off me! Stay away from me!

1:06:32.334 --> 1:06:34.503
Get... Stop. Stop!

1:06:34.602 --> 1:06:37.840
Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me!

1:06:39.140 --> 1:06:40.141
No!

1:06:53.621 --> 1:06:56.329
No. No. No.

1:07:03.531 --> 1:07:05.340
What's going on in there?

1:07:06.334 --> 1:07:07.369
Lay it off!

1:07:07.936 --> 1:07:09.574
Hey, Wanda, are you all right?

1:07:10.105 --> 1:07:11.550
What's the problem?

1:07:15.310 --> 1:07:16.516
Monster?

1:07:18.313 --> 1:07:19.553
Monster!

1:07:20.615 --> 1:07:21.584
Hey, yo!

1:07:23.018 --> 1:07:26.090
Open up the damn door!
Open up the damn door!

1:07:26.988 --> 1:07:27.989
Damn it!

1:07:29.624 --> 1:07:30.830
Wanda?

1:07:39.234 --> 1:07:40.736
What's happening, huh?

1:07:44.272 --> 1:07:45.410
Wanda?

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:50.252
Monster, how come
you didn't open the door?

1:07:53.181 --> 1:07:55.991
I hear you. I hear you.

1:07:56.217 --> 1:07:57.253
Wanda?

1:07:57.352 --> 1:07:59.127
Eddie. Eddie.

1:08:00.855 --> 1:08:02.334
What did you do?

1:08:03.792 --> 1:08:05.135
Move. Move.

1:08:12.934 --> 1:08:14.607
Are you fucking nuts?

1:08:15.203 --> 1:08:17.139
You weren't supposed to do that to her.

1:08:18.473 --> 1:08:21.010
You weren't supposed to hurt her!

1:08:21.509 --> 1:08:25.082
You weren't supposed to hurt her.
Mannish boy!

1:08:25.814 --> 1:08:29.557
Are you a man or are you an animal?

1:08:31.219 --> 1:08:33.290
You fucking animal!

1:08:42.363 --> 1:08:43.467
Eddie.

1:08:50.004 --> 1:08:52.211
Eddie. Love.

1:08:54.342 --> 1:08:56.083
Eddie. Love.

1:09:22.737 --> 1:09:24.978
Eddie!

1:09:26.207 --> 1:09:27.811
Eddie!

1:09:29.644 --> 1:09:31.380
Eddie!

1:09:31.479 --> 1:09:34.016
Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings

1:09:34.115 --> 1:09:38.689
who, pardoning my outward form,
would love me for the qualities in my heart.

1:09:40.355 --> 1:09:42.224
I cannot believe
that I'm the same creature

1:09:42.323 --> 1:09:45.202
whose thoughts were once
filled with beauty and love.

1:09:59.674 --> 1:10:03.145
Starting route to 26800
Mulholland Highway.

1:10:03.244 --> 1:10:05.314
Tum left onto West 7th Street.

1:10:05.413 --> 1:10:06.382
Hey!

1:10:17.158 --> 1:10:20.264
In 400 feet, turn left
onto South Broadway.

1:10:26.201 --> 1:10:29.472
Keep right to merge onto CA 110 North.

1:10:32.006 --> 1:10:34.710
Hey, you can't walk here. Stop.

1:10:39.581 --> 1:10:41.217
- Stop. Stop right there.
- In 500 feet,

1:10:41.316 --> 1:10:44.786
keep right to merge onto CA 110 North.

1:10:46.621 --> 1:10:49.258
Stop. You can't walk here.

1:10:49.357 --> 1:10:51.026
Stop right there.

1:10:51.125 --> 1:10:53.366
Sir, stop! I said stop.

1:10:53.928 --> 1:10:54.929
Stop.

1:11:02.036 --> 1:11:03.515
What the fuck?

1:11:07.275 --> 1:11:09.778
How the fuck? What the fuck?

1:11:11.479 --> 1:11:12.583
Fuck you!

1:11:13.014 --> 1:11:15.688
Fuck you, freak show! Fuck yourself!

1:11:16.284 --> 1:11:18.764
Shoot! You don't even
have the balls to shoot me.

1:11:19.153 --> 1:11:20.456
Shoot me!

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:34.840
The fallen angel becomes
a malignant devil.

1:11:36.037 --> 1:11:40.442
Yet even that enemy of God and man had
friends and associates in his desolation.

1:11:40.541 --> 1:11:41.986
Proceed to the route.

1:11:42.410 --> 1:11:43.787
I am alone.

1:11:47.949 --> 1:11:50.119
In 9.8 miles, keep right

1:11:50.218 --> 1:11:54.098
to merge onto US 101 North
towards Ventura.

1:11:54.489 --> 1:11:56.526
I will revenge my injuries.

1:11:57.959 --> 1:12:00.098
If I cannot inspire love,

1:12:01.129 --> 1:12:02.831
I will cause fear.

1:12:02.930 --> 1:12:07.879
In 19.6 miles, take exit 32
onto Las Virgenes Road.

1:12:22.417 --> 1:12:24.260
You have reached your destination.

1:13:52.707 --> 1:13:54.576
I don't know what's wrong with that guy.

1:14:07.688 --> 1:14:09.224
Sit on the bed.

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:15.164
Now here comes Dr. Feelgood.

1:14:21.402 --> 1:14:22.972
I love you so much.

1:14:53.468 --> 1:14:54.913
Oh, what's happened?

1:14:56.370 --> 1:14:57.439
Don't hurt him.

1:14:57.538 --> 1:14:58.573
No!

1:14:59.674 --> 1:15:01.517
No! No!

1:15:04.345 --> 1:15:06.484
- Let him go. Let him go.
- Mine!

1:15:06.981 --> 1:15:08.016
Why?

1:15:12.186 --> 1:15:16.498
You said you did not know me.

1:15:17.091 --> 1:15:18.661
I ugly.

1:15:19.627 --> 1:15:20.662
Stop!

1:15:20.761 --> 1:15:22.206
- No.
- Stop. Leave her.

1:15:22.830 --> 1:15:23.831
No.

1:15:24.899 --> 1:15:26.268
It's okay.

1:15:26.367 --> 1:15:28.278
It's okay, Adam.

1:15:29.170 --> 1:15:30.478
I'm sorry.

1:15:30.805 --> 1:15:33.046
- Adam?
- Yes.

1:15:33.841 --> 1:15:36.651
Your name is Adam.

1:16:27.094 --> 1:16:29.404
See? That's how we made you.

1:16:31.432 --> 1:16:33.535
- And we'll make you again.
- No.

1:16:33.634 --> 1:16:34.840
Oh, no, yes.

1:16:36.337 --> 1:16:37.372
Yes.

1:16:38.739 --> 1:16:41.879
And this time you'll be beautiful.

1:16:43.744 --> 1:16:45.246
Beautiful.

1:16:55.323 --> 1:16:56.393
Oh.

1:16:58.459 --> 1:17:01.963
You make me

1:17:04.165 --> 1:17:05.303
ugly.

1:17:09.003 --> 1:17:10.209
Why?

1:17:11.272 --> 1:17:14.109
I don't know. It was a mistake.

1:17:14.208 --> 1:17:16.711
The cells didn't replicate correctly,

1:17:17.645 --> 1:17:20.082
and God only knows
what turned you into such a vicious beast.

1:17:20.181 --> 1:17:21.182
Victor.

1:17:22.984 --> 1:17:26.693
He is not me.

1:17:28.022 --> 1:17:29.958
Not me.

1:17:30.057 --> 1:17:32.037
He is...

1:17:35.863 --> 1:17:36.832
Other.

1:17:36.931 --> 1:17:39.036
- He is exactly like you.
- No.

1:17:40.267 --> 1:17:42.873
I am

1:17:49.176 --> 1:17:50.479
I.

1:17:50.578 --> 1:17:52.080
Yes.

1:17:52.179 --> 1:17:54.352
And you will be you again.

1:17:56.550 --> 1:18:00.794
My boy, I understand your unhappiness.

1:18:01.989 --> 1:18:03.866
I understand your pain.

1:18:04.859 --> 1:18:07.465
And I can make it go away.

1:18:09.630 --> 1:18:13.077
You will close your eyes
and you will sleep.

1:18:14.335 --> 1:18:16.772
And when you wake up,

1:18:16.871 --> 1:18:19.044
you'll be just fine.

1:18:30.184 --> 1:18:33.631
He is dead?

1:18:34.355 --> 1:18:36.335
He's nothing but clay.

1:18:37.525 --> 1:18:40.768
But we can all breathe life into him.

1:18:43.197 --> 1:18:47.043
You see, that is the secret
that God is so jealous of.

1:18:48.302 --> 1:18:49.679
The formula for life.

1:18:50.471 --> 1:18:53.816
And I, me, Dr. Frankenstein,

1:18:55.543 --> 1:18:56.945
discovered it,

1:18:57.044 --> 1:18:58.648
and I will do it again.

1:19:25.106 --> 1:19:26.585
No!

1:19:28.375 --> 1:19:30.582
I am!

1:19:42.957 --> 1:19:45.198
I am.

1:19:45.626 --> 1:19:48.072
I am.

1:19:48.562 --> 1:19:50.735
I am. I am.

1:19:51.232 --> 1:19:54.702
I am.

1:19:56.670 --> 1:19:57.910
You.

1:19:58.706 --> 1:20:00.777
You made me.

1:20:04.478 --> 1:20:06.115
You

1:20:07.509 --> 1:20:09.598
hate me.

1:20:09.898 --> 1:20:11.088
No.

1:20:16.857 --> 1:20:20.828
I'm alone.

1:20:24.465 --> 1:20:27.049
I'm

1:20:28.146 --> 1:20:30.046
alone.

1:20:50.658 --> 1:20:52.961
I'll decapitate him
and then incinerate his head.

1:20:53.060 --> 1:20:54.329
- Get off.
- No.

1:20:54.428 --> 1:20:55.430
- Move.
- I can't.

1:20:55.529 --> 1:20:56.765
Don't be ridiculous.

1:21:08.475 --> 1:21:10.284
No. Oh.

1:21:11.579 --> 1:21:14.059
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

1:22:36.263 --> 1:22:42.077
I shall collect my funeral pile and consume
to ashes this miserable frame.

1:22:43.637 --> 1:22:47.909
That its remains may afford no light
to any curious and unhallowed wretch

1:22:48.008 --> 1:22:50.454
who would create such another
as I have been.

1:22:57.584 --> 1:22:59.962
She is dead, who called me into being.

1:23:01.088 --> 1:23:03.625
When I shall be no more,

1:23:03.724 --> 1:23:06.898
the very remembrance of us both
will speedily vanish.

1:23:07.494 --> 1:23:10.737
I will no longer see the sun nor stars,

1:23:11.565 --> 1:23:13.909
or feel the winds play upon my cheeks.

1:23:14.668 --> 1:23:17.512
I shall ascend
my funeral pile triumphantly

1:23:19.473 --> 1:23:22.181
and exalt in the agony
of the torturing flames.

1:23:24.311 --> 1:23:26.951
The light of that conflagration
will fade away.

1:23:28.082 --> 1:23:31.086
My ashes will be swept into the sea
by the winds.

1:23:32.152 --> 1:23:34.359
My spirit will sleep in peace.

1:23:35.489 --> 1:23:39.232
Or if it thinks,
it will not surely think thus.

1:23:41.862 --> 1:23:43.068
Farewell.

1:24:31.078 --> 1:24:36.050
I am Adam!
