fisherman because the shots protected

15:45.370 --> 15:47.948
him

15:47.948 --> 15:51.909
eaten by a shark mana would never accept

15:50.139 --> 15:53.049
that because he knew the Sharks would

21:59.839 --> 22:05.058
that you and Nick before the

22:02.329 --> 22:05.928
relationship actually begins you just

22:05.058 --> 22:08.329
met

22:05.929 --> 22:12.290
everything is possible the better they

22:08.329 --> 22:14.389
start the worst day and sometimes I

22:12.289 --> 22:17.450
think we don't see the person not at

22:14.390 --> 22:20.179
first always see is the image that we

22:17.450 --> 22:23.450
create its that illusion that we fall in

22:20.179 --> 22:26.030
love with not the reality at all then

22:23.450 --> 22:28.700
the illusion falls away and were left

22:26.029 --> 22:35.240
with the only disappointment

22:28.700 --> 22:38.090
I've lived that then I think I'll maybe

22:35.240 --> 22:41.058
this time this guy might be different

22:38.089 --> 23:06.579
that's what I mean in the beginning

work you

29:21.819 --> 29:25.119
that's why I didn't tell you in the

29:23.259 --> 29:28.690
beginning yeah

29:25.119 --> 29:30.849
don't you worry about me okay we're

29:28.690 --> 29:32.920
gonna get through this together as long

29:30.849 --> 29:34.149
as we're honest with each other and

29:32.920 --> 29:42.340
trust each other

29:34.150 --> 29:53.330
alright okay alright okay listen up

29:42.339 --> 29:55.099
in order Jason do you mind

29:53.329 --> 29:59.619
in order for this team to be fully

29:55.099 --> 30:01.659
prepared

29:59.619 --> 30:04.029
we have to understand every aspect of

30:01.660 --> 30:06.759
the rescue especially the victim's point

30:04.029 --> 30:10.029
of view it's an interesting idea to feel

30:06.759 --> 30:11.920
what they feel the fear the terror are

30:10.029 --> 30:13.690
you gonna do it yeah how do you plan on

30:11.920 --> 30:15.850
making us feel like the victim you put

30:13.690 --> 30:18.789
any one of us in the water was starving

30:15.849 --> 30:22.149
we drowned my gonna put you in the water

30:18.789 --> 30:24.490
the victim is usually in a situation of

30:22.150 --> 30:25.540
life or debt which they've never faced

30:24.490 --> 30:31.808
before and that's what makes it so

30:25.539 --> 30:34.359
terrifying to reflect out we take away

30:31.808 --> 30:36.609
the sense that you depend on most site

30:34.359 --> 30:38.889
put you in a position of jeopardy which

30:36.609 --> 30:41.169
you've never experienced before leaving

30:38.890 --> 30:46.360
you vulnerable gone

30:41.170 --> 30:52.450
Jason it's time you learn with the

30:46.359 --> 30:57.719
victim fields you take those off on the

30:52.450 --> 31:00.299
next plane home

30:57.720 --> 31:02.160
why me because you're too self-reliant

31:00.299 --> 31:04.680
you have to learn that each one of us

31:02.160 --> 31:06.390
depends on the other but if you don't

31:04.680 --> 31:09.870
want to do it you can give it to someone

31:06.390 --> 31:13.250
else

31:09.869 --> 31:31.859
it's fine I'll do it

31:13.250 --> 31:36.750
come on now

31:31.859 --> 31:39.479
let's go purpose of this training

31:36.750 --> 31:41.940
exercises books you're gonna have to

31:39.480 --> 31:44.849
learn to trust whoever comes to rescue

31:41.940 --> 31:47.929
put your life in their hands why are you

31:44.849 --> 31:50.538
making me do this i start with me

31:47.929 --> 31:52.190
if you don't have a trust Jason maybe

31:50.538 --> 31:55.548
it's because you never need to trust

31:52.190 --> 31:57.919
before here we have two trips each and

31:55.548 --> 31:59.720
every one of us must trust the others as

31:57.919 --> 32:02.389
light bars and its members of a

31:59.720 --> 32:04.669
life-saving team being an individual

32:02.388 --> 32:08.628
even a hero is fine on the sand at home

32:04.669 --> 32:12.200
but here we r IC so that's about

32:08.628 --> 32:15.678
teaching you to know what it feels like

32:12.200 --> 32:16.909
I mean really feels like to be alone to

32:15.679 --> 32:22.140
be dependent

32:16.909 --> 32:27.370
trust your life

32:22.140 --> 32:31.030
