00:00.822 --> 00:02.451
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.452 --> 00:05.141
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!

00:05.142 --> 00:06.615
Ruben: A witch named
Eva Sinclair

00:06.616 --> 00:09.232
was stealing children
to channel their power.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.656
It doesn't matter
what she's done.

00:10.657 --> 00:12.547
I've still appropriated
her body without her consent.

00:12.548 --> 00:14.679
The wolves need a new leader.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.205
I can help you become the leader
your pack deserves.

00:19.206 --> 00:22.509
Josephine: The treme coven wants
Vincent Griffith returned.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.886
Agh!

00:26.887 --> 00:28.399
Who are you?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.035
Elijah: Vincent Griffith
is alive and free

00:30.036 --> 00:32.058
from the influence
of my brother Finn.

00:32.058 --> 00:35.245
If I have woken from my slumber,
then Dahlia has, as well.

00:35.246 --> 00:37.129
Once she's sensed
your child's magic,

00:37.130 --> 00:38.690
she will come for her.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.261 --> 01:00.932
Eat, Freya,
or you'll waste away.

01:06.271 --> 01:07.934
Stubborn child!

01:07.959 --> 01:09.141
You need your strength

01:09.142 --> 01:10.637
so that I may teach you
to use the power

01:10.638 --> 01:13.231
that runs strong
in our bloodline,

01:13.256 --> 01:14.814
that will keep us warm
in the cold,

01:14.815 --> 01:17.483
give us good health
when others fall ill.

01:17.484 --> 01:21.614
With that power,
we will defeat our enemies.

01:24.007 --> 01:28.872
We can stay young
and beautiful.

01:28.897 --> 01:31.958
You need not be afraid.

01:31.983 --> 01:36.756
Together... We will be
the strongest witches

01:36.757 --> 01:39.924
this world has ever seen.

01:39.949 --> 01:42.029
I want my mama!

01:42.030 --> 01:44.797
Your mother didn't want you.

01:44.798 --> 01:46.998
She gave you away.

01:46.999 --> 01:49.870
This is your home now.

01:49.871 --> 01:52.687
I am your only family...

01:56.478 --> 02:01.362
And there is no greater
strength than family.

02:30.853 --> 02:32.788
Aah!

02:32.789 --> 02:34.755
No, no!

02:46.670 --> 02:50.141
Stay away from the window
what's all that bloody racket?

02:50.142 --> 02:51.541
Just stay put.
I'll handle it.

02:51.542 --> 02:54.958
Handle it?
Handle what?

02:58.903 --> 03:00.551
Marcel: Whatever the problem is,

03:00.552 --> 03:03.466
you don't back up, I guarantee
you, it's gonna get worse.

03:03.491 --> 03:06.054
Marcel Gerard, do you realize

03:06.055 --> 03:09.021
you're harboring
a renegade witch?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.989
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.059
Is that a fact?

03:18.006 --> 03:20.306
I thought I told you
to stay put.

03:20.307 --> 03:24.882
Well, I hate being told
what to do, so I ignored you.

03:24.883 --> 03:26.810
Beg pardon, luv,
but I think this is all

03:26.811 --> 03:28.649
a simple misunderstanding.

03:28.650 --> 03:30.848
No. This is retaliation

03:30.849 --> 03:34.855
for the evil you
unleashed last night.

03:34.856 --> 03:40.920
Two of our children attacked
unmercifully, one dead,

03:40.945 --> 03:43.256
the other missing.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.318
All signs lead to you, Eva.

03:46.319 --> 03:47.886
Wait. Hold on.
The witch that you knew

03:47.887 --> 03:49.893
as Eva Sinclair
is gone, all right?

03:49.894 --> 03:52.724
Her body was taken over
by Rebekah Mikaelson.

03:52.749 --> 03:57.094
Is that your version
of an alibi?

03:57.095 --> 03:59.324
Take her.

03:59.325 --> 04:00.836
Elijah: That won't be necessary.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.896
Miss Larue...

04:07.897 --> 04:10.533
It would be a great shame
to soil the goodwill

04:10.558 --> 04:12.869
of our recent agreement.

04:12.894 --> 04:15.105
Now I am sorry for your loss,

04:15.106 --> 04:16.937
but Marcel is telling the truth.

04:16.938 --> 04:19.474
Rebekah now occupies
the body of Eva Sinclair,

04:19.475 --> 04:22.945
and my sister is
innocent of this crime.

04:22.946 --> 04:26.511
Now you have my word I will find
whoever is responsible

04:26.512 --> 04:29.148
and make certain
that justice is served.

04:31.246 --> 04:35.249
And now I would encourage
you all to leave.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.152
You have till tomorrow.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.782
After that, it won't
matter what I say.

04:39.783 --> 04:44.083
Witches will stop at nothing
to protect their children.

04:44.084 --> 04:48.071
It's an impulse I
know you can respect.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.194
Klaus: There you are finally.

04:54.195 --> 04:55.593
I was delayed.

04:55.594 --> 04:57.495
Our guest of honor
will be here momentarily.

04:57.496 --> 05:00.335
Strange. The house is
conspicuously absent

05:00.336 --> 05:02.168
of our lupine guests.

05:02.193 --> 05:03.838
I do hope it wasn't
on my account.

05:03.839 --> 05:06.173
I sent Hayley and her
poorly groomed husband off

05:06.174 --> 05:07.740
to spend the day
with their werewolf brethren

05:07.741 --> 05:10.005
to test the limits of
their new abilities,

05:10.006 --> 05:14.343
leaving me to deal with
family business as I see fit.

05:14.344 --> 05:16.677
Niklaus, Rebekah's
situation has taken a turn.

05:16.678 --> 05:18.147
We may need Freya's assistance,

05:18.148 --> 05:20.979
so whatever you are
planning here, don't.

05:21.004 --> 05:23.951
All I'm planning is
a simple chat

05:23.952 --> 05:25.479
with a long lost relative.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.319
You yourself said
to hear her out.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.991
And you yourself said
that would be idiocy.

05:29.992 --> 05:31.191
Did I?

05:31.192 --> 05:33.127
Well, that does sound like me.

05:33.128 --> 05:34.391
Regardless on the off chance,

05:34.392 --> 05:37.399
Freya has some information
that could protect my daughter,

05:37.400 --> 05:40.166
I prefer she share
it on my terms.

05:40.167 --> 05:43.069
Ah. I think I hear her now!

05:43.070 --> 05:45.378
Sister!

05:45.403 --> 05:46.573
Well, come in, come in.

05:46.574 --> 05:48.381
Make yourself comfortable.

05:54.079 --> 05:56.431
Morning.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.446
How you feeling?

05:57.447 --> 05:59.215
Nauseous.

05:59.216 --> 06:01.623
I can't concentrate.

06:01.624 --> 06:02.823
I can't really do any magic,

06:02.824 --> 06:06.493
but I suppose that was the point,
seeing as how I can smell

06:06.494 --> 06:08.756
the lobelia flower you've
been putting in my food, man.

06:08.757 --> 06:11.571
Can't be too careful
with witches, hmm?

06:11.596 --> 06:13.529
Hmm. That something you learned

06:13.530 --> 06:15.729
from experience, Marcel Gerard,

06:15.730 --> 06:17.497
back when you controlled
the quarter witches

06:17.498 --> 06:19.620
with all your rules and, uh...

06:19.645 --> 06:22.165
Clk clk...
Public executions?

06:22.190 --> 06:23.997
You know who I am.

06:23.998 --> 06:28.003
That's good because I got some
questions that need answers,

06:28.004 --> 06:30.370
and you seem to know
what happens to people

06:30.371 --> 06:32.035
who don't give me what I want.

06:32.036 --> 06:33.707
Mmm. I know you ain't
the king around here no more,

06:33.708 --> 06:34.812
and I know you
can't keep me here.

06:34.813 --> 06:37.547
I'm the treme, Marcel.

06:37.548 --> 06:40.778
Witches from there, they're
a little bit of a harder breed

06:40.779 --> 06:42.314
than what it is you're used to.

06:42.315 --> 06:44.771
Yeah. They're gonna
want me back.

06:44.796 --> 06:46.986
Actually, they already
do want you back.

06:46.987 --> 06:53.289
Yeah. Matter of fact, they wanted
you back for 9 months.

06:53.290 --> 06:56.192
Yeah. Check the date.

06:56.193 --> 06:59.744
You might notice
a little time gap.

07:01.965 --> 07:03.790
Man, what you do to me?

07:03.815 --> 07:06.531
Oh, me? Hey. I can't
make 9 months vanish, no.

07:06.532 --> 07:09.087
Your beef is
with a guy named Finn.

07:09.112 --> 07:10.940
See, he took possession
of your body,

07:10.941 --> 07:12.571
got into all kinds
of trouble, too.

07:12.572 --> 07:15.568
Made some pretty nasty
enemies, I might add.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.100
Whoa!

07:18.101 --> 07:21.043
Look. I'll tell you
all about it, but first,

07:21.044 --> 07:23.643
you got to tell me about a treme
witch that you might know...

07:23.644 --> 07:25.474
Eva Sinclair.

07:27.611 --> 07:29.111
Heh.

07:32.343 --> 07:33.587
Sore subject?

07:33.588 --> 07:35.388
Mmm. Heh.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.091
I'm done talking.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.293
Davina: Are you serious?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.926
I'm supposed to drop all
of my work to help you

07:41.927 --> 07:43.335
figure out your nightmares?

07:43.336 --> 07:44.934
They're more than dreams.

07:44.935 --> 07:46.797
Look. I came here hoping
you'd have some witchy way

07:46.798 --> 07:50.098
to figure out what's wrong
and help me fix it,

07:50.099 --> 07:52.674
though you don't look
so good yourself.

07:52.675 --> 07:54.305
Have you gotten
any sleep lately?

07:54.306 --> 07:56.778
No! I've been here
studying all this stuff

07:56.779 --> 07:58.442
since Kol died, and I thought
you were gonna help me

07:58.443 --> 08:00.388
bring him back
like you promised.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.846
Look. I can't help Kol
if the witch he stuck me in

08:02.847 --> 08:04.140
ends up taking me over.

08:04.141 --> 08:05.443
There's something wrong.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.242
I think the rightful
owner of this body

08:07.243 --> 08:10.231
is waking up inside me,
and she's angry.

08:15.112 --> 08:17.007
These are Kol's spell books.

08:17.008 --> 08:19.094
I'm sure there's something
in here that can help.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.885
This witch hoop, it's Danish.

08:24.886 --> 08:27.884
Is that from when you all lived
in Copenhagen in the 1500s?

08:27.885 --> 08:29.420
Quite the eye.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.652
Forgive me. Are we here to
discuss family heirlooms,

08:30.653 --> 08:32.691
or do we have
more pressing concerns?

08:32.692 --> 08:35.722
Please excuse my brother's
lack of decorum.

08:35.724 --> 08:40.496
He's been in a foul mood
of late, but he is right.

08:40.498 --> 08:42.328
I did ask you here in the hopes

08:42.328 --> 08:45.966
that you would share
some of Dahlia's secrets.

08:45.967 --> 08:49.733
So without further
ado, let's get to it.

08:49.734 --> 08:51.234
Ahem.

08:52.803 --> 08:54.665
The first thing you should know

08:54.666 --> 08:57.768
is that Dahlia's the most powerful
witch I have ever seen.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.935
She craves more power still.

08:59.936 --> 09:02.102
Right now, she is like me,

09:02.103 --> 09:04.006
limited to one year
of life in a century,

09:04.007 --> 09:06.205
but she wants to be free
of that restriction,

09:06.206 --> 09:08.309
to gain true immortality,

09:08.310 --> 09:11.347
and that is why she will come
here, drawn by your daughter

09:11.348 --> 09:14.609
to take the child's
power for herself.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.343
She will kill anyone
who would defy her.

09:17.344 --> 09:19.214
And yet you would defy her.

09:19.215 --> 09:20.518
I don't have a choice.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.518
She will never let me be free.

09:22.519 --> 09:27.058
My one chance is to align
with you and kill her.

09:28.653 --> 09:31.720
Well, now that we're
all suitably motivated,

09:31.721 --> 09:34.106
let's talk specifics.

09:34.131 --> 09:39.465
For you to understand, I need
to start from the beginning.

09:39.466 --> 09:41.781
After taking me from my family,

09:41.806 --> 09:46.376
Dahlia used me to forge a new
brand of connective magic,

09:46.377 --> 09:48.374
one that augmented my power,

09:48.375 --> 09:50.414
even as it allowed her
to draw from me.

09:50.439 --> 09:53.443
Take my hand
and begin your trance.

09:53.444 --> 09:58.297
Both: Med dette seglet,
cum soluta nobis saman.

09:58.322 --> 09:59.447
Med dette seglet,

09:59.448 --> 10:01.151
cum soluta

10:01.152 --> 10:02.519
nobis saman.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.151
Med dette seglet,

10:04.152 --> 10:05.687
cum soluta

10:05.688 --> 10:07.119
nobis saman.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.791
Med dette seglet,

10:08.792 --> 10:10.295
cum soluta

10:10.296 --> 10:12.103
nobis saman.

10:30.569 --> 10:32.438
Freya, voice-over:
Once we were bonded,

10:32.439 --> 10:34.792
Dahlia became unstoppable.

10:37.276 --> 10:40.106
She wasted no time
proving her might.

10:40.107 --> 10:44.515
The chief of a nearby village
threatened to run us off,

10:44.516 --> 10:47.187
accusing Dahlia of witchcraft.

10:47.188 --> 10:51.292
She decided to make an example
out of the entire encampment...

10:51.293 --> 10:56.089
Men, women, children.

10:56.090 --> 11:00.794
She killed them all
with a wave of her hand.

11:00.795 --> 11:04.970
That was my first inkling
of the power that Dahlia had.

11:04.971 --> 11:06.465
Over the course
of a thousand years,

11:06.466 --> 11:08.137
she's only grown stronger,

11:08.138 --> 11:10.273
and she will bring all her
power to bear against you

11:10.274 --> 11:12.622
when she comes for your child.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.645
Excuse me.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.244
Rebekah, how are you feeling?

11:22.245 --> 11:24.713
As if I walked straight
into a brick wall.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.648
Any luck with Freya?

11:26.649 --> 11:28.582
Luck is not the word
that I would use.

11:28.583 --> 11:29.813
You should be here.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.243
Fine. I'm on my way now.

11:36.408 --> 11:38.045
Ok.

11:38.046 --> 11:39.546
Aah!

11:52.132 --> 11:54.053
Oh, ho ho ho!
You're getting faster.

11:54.054 --> 11:55.727
Or maybe you're just
getting slower, huh?

11:57.683 --> 11:59.502
Unh!

12:03.489 --> 12:04.855
Keep your head up.

12:04.856 --> 12:06.894
Low center, guard your face.

12:12.495 --> 12:13.461
Aah!

12:13.462 --> 12:15.660
Ow, ow, ow!
What the hell?

12:15.661 --> 12:17.099
You left yourself wide open.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.434
It was your idea to
come out here and spar.

12:19.435 --> 12:20.529
I'm doing this for you.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.065
Oh. For me?

12:22.066 --> 12:24.273
You're the one leading
a pack of superwolves.

12:24.274 --> 12:25.873
How long before they decide that
they don't want to take orders

12:25.874 --> 12:27.041
from you anymore, huh?

12:27.042 --> 12:28.673
Because the only way
you can stay Alpha

12:28.674 --> 12:31.241
is by always
staying the strongest.

12:31.242 --> 12:32.713
You guys done?

12:32.714 --> 12:34.453
This macho stuff
is cute and all,

12:34.478 --> 12:37.514
but don't make me come out
there and kick both your asses.

12:40.955 --> 12:42.954
Look. If you got a problem
with the way I lead,

12:42.955 --> 12:44.890
now's the time to speak up.

12:44.891 --> 12:46.529
Klaus is acting like
we're on his leash.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.160
You think the guys
don't see that?

12:48.161 --> 12:50.127
Things are changing, Jackson.

12:50.128 --> 12:51.493
Our people aren't
cursed anymore.

12:51.494 --> 12:53.932
We're strong.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.459
If any of them see
you as vulnerable,

12:55.460 --> 12:56.699
then they're gonna
challenge you for Alpha

12:56.700 --> 12:58.731
because that is what wolves do.

12:58.732 --> 13:02.097
Are you putting yourself
in that category?

13:02.098 --> 13:04.471
I'm looking out for you.

13:04.472 --> 13:05.972
That's all.

13:10.836 --> 13:12.875
Your stories are fascinating,

13:12.876 --> 13:15.739
and Dahlia does indeed
sound dreadful,

13:15.740 --> 13:19.440
but Elijah and I have killed
our fair share of evil witches.

13:19.441 --> 13:20.712
Not like her.

13:20.713 --> 13:22.574
What are her weaknesses?

13:22.575 --> 13:25.579
She's paranoid,
obsessed with power.

13:25.580 --> 13:27.874
She hungers constantly
for what's been denied her,

13:27.875 --> 13:30.249
be it love or revenge.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.412
Yes. I think I'm familiar
with the type.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.576
When I was a child,
she would tell me

13:35.577 --> 13:36.974
tales of her own youth,

13:36.999 --> 13:40.412
of being victimized by
those stronger than her.

13:40.413 --> 13:43.242
Dahlia vowed never
to be weak again.

13:43.243 --> 13:46.344
She bargained for the firstborn
of Esther's bloodline,

13:46.345 --> 13:48.047
intending to raise
us in her own image,

13:48.048 --> 13:50.013
forming a coven of
her own from which

13:50.014 --> 13:52.114
she could draw endless power.

13:52.115 --> 13:53.713
That plan was foiled
the day she learned

13:53.714 --> 13:55.910
that Esther had
ended her bloodline

13:55.935 --> 14:00.050
by turning her
children into vampires.

14:00.051 --> 14:02.018
And so the burden fell to me.

14:02.019 --> 14:04.458
Dahlia demanded
I bear the firstborn

14:04.459 --> 14:05.922
that would add to her power,

14:05.923 --> 14:11.263
but I would not allow a child
of mine to live as I did,

14:11.264 --> 14:14.694
as a slave.

14:14.695 --> 14:20.201
So I vowed never to love, never
to have a child of my own.

14:23.504 --> 14:26.868
Of course, the more I resisted,

14:26.869 --> 14:29.898
the harder Dahlia
fought to control me...

14:31.098 --> 14:33.073
Until the day
when she took the last

14:33.074 --> 14:36.935
of what little freedom
I had left.

14:51.437 --> 14:53.634
Take my hand.

14:55.989 --> 14:57.987
No.

14:57.988 --> 14:59.723
This is not right.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.934
You've already taken
everything from me.

15:01.959 --> 15:04.160
I will not follow you
into this madness.

15:04.161 --> 15:07.663
don't be stupid.
I'm offering you eternal life.

15:07.664 --> 15:09.565
We will sleep
for a century and wake

15:09.566 --> 15:12.228
with a power unlike
any that's ever been seen.

15:12.229 --> 15:13.467
It's what we wanted.

15:13.468 --> 15:15.730
What you wanted.

15:15.731 --> 15:19.785
Please do not bind
me with this curse.

15:25.976 --> 15:28.107
Ungrateful child,
you will thank me for this

15:28.108 --> 15:30.442
in one century or the next.

15:30.443 --> 15:34.476
Magi somn et
immortalis, binde oss.

15:34.477 --> 15:38.680
And so we slept, our magic
accruing over time

15:38.681 --> 15:42.244
until we woke, filled
with immense power

15:42.245 --> 15:45.010
and allowed to live
a single year of life.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.416
That has been the existence

15:47.417 --> 15:50.644
I have suffered for
the last 10 centuries.

15:50.645 --> 15:53.378
Ha ha ha! Well...

15:53.379 --> 15:56.786
It's quite the ordeal, isn't it?

15:56.787 --> 16:04.038
But it does beg the question
why not end it yourself?

16:04.063 --> 16:08.326
A high enough bridge,
a tight enough noose.

16:08.327 --> 16:10.262
You must have considered it.

16:12.632 --> 16:16.597
Long ago, I did consider it,

16:16.598 --> 16:20.563
but Dahlia would never
give me even that freedom.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.265
I would later learn
the spell made me like her...

16:23.290 --> 16:25.600
Immortal

16:25.601 --> 16:28.334
and impervious to harm.

16:32.040 --> 16:40.838
So you see, I am like you,
a creature of great power

16:40.839 --> 16:43.273
cursed for all time.

16:49.037 --> 16:51.075
Cami, if you don't
want to do this...

16:51.076 --> 16:52.539
Of course I don't
want to do this.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.306
That guy practically
tried to kill me.

16:54.307 --> 16:55.609
Well, not this guy.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.544
Vincent Griffith is
just another victim.

16:57.545 --> 16:59.174
Yes, but as of yesterday,
he was Finn,

16:59.175 --> 17:01.478
Finn who lied to me,
who used me,

17:01.479 --> 17:03.783
who tried to erase
me from my own body,

17:03.784 --> 17:05.580
and now we're just
gonna hang out.

17:05.582 --> 17:06.813
I mean, it's fine.
I'll do it.

17:06.814 --> 17:09.269
I just need a drink first.

17:10.714 --> 17:12.106
Bring him in.

17:18.392 --> 17:19.991
Vincent: What is this, Marcel?

17:19.992 --> 17:21.654
You're dragging me from
one dump to another

17:21.655 --> 17:23.093
without telling me
what's going on, man.

17:23.094 --> 17:24.229
Dump. Ouch.

17:24.230 --> 17:25.861
And here I thought
a change in venue

17:25.862 --> 17:27.461
might brighten your mood.

17:27.462 --> 17:30.396
Maybe it's me, so
how about I give you a chance

17:30.397 --> 17:32.501
to talk to my friend here?

17:33.867 --> 17:38.536
You be nice,
all right, or I won't.

17:38.537 --> 17:40.071
I'll be right outside.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.074
Would you like to sit down?

17:46.549 --> 17:48.653
Ok.

17:48.654 --> 17:50.102
I'm Cami.

17:50.127 --> 17:53.256
Look. Whoever you are,
you should know

17:53.257 --> 17:55.022
this isn't gonna work.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.861
I do not break, not for vampires

17:57.862 --> 18:00.828
and not for pretty-faced
whatever you are.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.259
Well, that's a relief.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.498
The last time we spoke,
I got the feeling

18:03.499 --> 18:05.865
you were kind of
obsessed with me.

18:05.866 --> 18:08.264
You knew the guy
who did this to me?

18:08.265 --> 18:11.206
I'll tell you about it
if you want.

18:13.564 --> 18:15.666
And what's in it for you?

18:15.667 --> 18:19.367
A little exchange of
information never hurt anyone.

18:19.368 --> 18:21.239
Look. If you want to be
the guy in the room

18:21.240 --> 18:23.669
who doesn't know where
he was last week, that's fine,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.204
but if you want to
know the truth

18:25.205 --> 18:29.707
from someone who had a front
row seat, sit down.

18:53.815 --> 18:55.045
Elijah?

18:55.046 --> 18:56.613
I expected you hours ago.

18:56.614 --> 19:00.964
Yes. Well, I seem to have
lost track of time.

19:00.989 --> 19:03.421
What's wrong?
Where are you?

19:03.422 --> 19:06.754
That's just it.
I don't know.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.902
You still thinking
about what Aiden said?

19:25.903 --> 19:28.277
He's just trying to help.

19:28.278 --> 19:31.612
Being Alpha's
an honor, you know.

19:31.613 --> 19:34.665
It's one you have to
earn every day.

19:34.690 --> 19:36.282
The pack is changing.

19:36.283 --> 19:38.009
You know, we're gonna
face some challenges.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.414
I just want them to know
that I'm here to lead for them,

19:40.415 --> 19:43.077
put them first.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.947
Look. The pack loves you, Jack.

19:45.948 --> 19:47.946
You just have to
remind them of that.

19:47.947 --> 19:49.450
Buy them a round of beers,

19:49.451 --> 19:51.722
turn on that backwoods
bayou charm.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.352
Worked on me.

19:55.090 --> 19:56.793
What about our other problem?

19:56.794 --> 20:00.760
Ahem. You mean,
our evil landlord?

20:00.761 --> 20:02.991
Klaus acts like we're
his personal army.

20:02.992 --> 20:04.766
I don't trust him.

20:04.767 --> 20:07.629
I can handle Klaus.

20:07.630 --> 20:10.100
We're a team, right?

20:10.101 --> 20:12.971
You and I united
the pack together.

20:12.972 --> 20:15.067
Are things changing?
Yes,

20:15.068 --> 20:17.104
but one of those changes
is that we no longer

20:17.105 --> 20:19.331
have to go through this alone.

20:29.898 --> 20:31.799
It was this witch Eva.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.397
The nasty, little cow
is inside me,

20:33.398 --> 20:34.765
trying to bust her way out.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.803
Freya is waiting downstairs.
Perhaps...

20:36.804 --> 20:38.666
Have you lost your mind?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.336
Tell me we're not
considering opening

20:40.337 --> 20:42.334
our sister's head to someone
we barely know.

20:42.335 --> 20:44.932
Nik, for God's sake,
she is our sister.

20:44.933 --> 20:47.036
I've know it since she saved
me from the fauline cottage.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.307
An act no doubt meant
to secure your trust,

20:49.308 --> 20:50.539
perhaps for this very moment,

20:50.540 --> 20:52.980
to strike when
we are vulnerable.

20:52.981 --> 20:56.579
No. We've no way to prove that
anything she said today is true.

20:56.580 --> 20:59.482
Niklaus, I understand
your concern.

20:59.483 --> 21:02.415
Both of us are powerless
to help our sister.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.047
Now either we leave
Rebekah to suffer,

21:04.048 --> 21:06.254
or we place our faith
in the hands of someone

21:06.255 --> 21:08.855
I believe to be our blood.

21:08.856 --> 21:10.927
Right now, I'm inclined to give

21:10.928 --> 21:13.462
the benefit of the doubt
to family.

21:15.432 --> 21:16.968
I woke up last night.

21:16.969 --> 21:18.463
I didn't know where I was

21:18.464 --> 21:20.103
or how long I'd been there,

21:20.104 --> 21:22.638
let alone that I'd lost
9 months of my life.

21:22.639 --> 21:24.838
Marcel said the guy
who possessed me, this Finn,

21:24.839 --> 21:27.006
he made a lot of enemies.

21:27.007 --> 21:28.507
What'd he do?

21:30.808 --> 21:33.511
He...

21:33.512 --> 21:35.327
Terrorized the city.

21:35.352 --> 21:38.352
He threatened
and manipulated his enemies,

21:38.353 --> 21:45.528
tried to steal an innocent
child, and executed his brother.

21:50.324 --> 21:59.800
Mr. Griffith, Vincent, what you
experienced was a violation

21:59.801 --> 22:02.800
of a profoundly personal nature,

22:02.801 --> 22:06.608
and whatever you're feeling,
I am here to listen.

22:06.633 --> 22:09.710
That's just it.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.309
What do I say?

22:11.310 --> 22:12.940
Am... am... am I...
Am I supposed to feel bad

22:12.941 --> 22:14.180
for these people that I hurt,

22:14.181 --> 22:17.251
am I... am I supposed
to feel guilty for this...

22:19.718 --> 22:21.514
For this man I killed?

22:24.556 --> 22:26.381
I...

22:31.228 --> 22:32.564
I'm sorry.

22:32.565 --> 22:36.330
Hey. It's ok.
You're gonna be ok.

22:38.003 --> 22:40.896
Did he...

22:40.897 --> 22:43.670
Did I hurt you?

22:43.671 --> 22:45.499
Listen to me.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.000
You didn't do anything,

22:48.001 --> 22:50.501
and whatever else
may have happened,

22:50.502 --> 22:53.562
the only thing you
can do now is move on.

22:59.106 --> 23:00.606
Rebekah.

23:02.189 --> 23:04.273
It's good to see you again.

23:04.274 --> 23:07.209
And you, though I'd
prefer better circumstances.

23:07.210 --> 23:10.182
You needn't worry.
Elijah explained the problem,

23:10.183 --> 23:11.306
and I can help.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.672
Rather confident, aren't we?

23:18.944 --> 23:21.308
The spirit of
the host body is powerful,

23:21.333 --> 23:24.350
but I can cast a spell,
put you in a deep sleep,

23:24.351 --> 23:26.989
and then suppress
this other essence.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.516
You'll be just fine.

23:28.517 --> 23:30.442
Lovely.
When do we start?

23:30.467 --> 23:31.819
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

23:31.820 --> 23:34.722
She spouts off
some magical diagnosis,

23:34.723 --> 23:36.425
and we are all
supposed to applaud.

23:36.426 --> 23:38.161
Nik, she's trying to help.

23:38.162 --> 23:39.865
Yes, but for the sake of keeping

23:39.866 --> 23:41.666
our options open,
why not write down

23:41.667 --> 23:43.468
your spells and incantations?

23:43.469 --> 23:45.340
That way,
we can have them double-checked

23:45.341 --> 23:47.907
by an impartial third party,
say Davina.

23:47.908 --> 23:49.075
She'd love to prove me wrong.

23:49.076 --> 23:51.610
I doubt she would
understand my magic,

23:51.611 --> 23:53.810
let alone have
the power to execute it.

23:53.811 --> 23:56.576
Oh. So you're
our only hope then?

23:56.577 --> 23:59.012
Seems rather convenient,
doesn't it?

24:00.912 --> 24:04.550
I knew it would be difficult
to win your trust, Niklaus.

24:04.551 --> 24:06.717
Your reputation precedes you...

24:07.996 --> 24:10.085
But if we are to face
Dahlia together,

24:10.086 --> 24:12.060
you will have to trust me.

24:12.061 --> 24:13.891
Given the peril
that Rebekah now faces,

24:13.892 --> 24:15.754
are you truly incapable
of giving me

24:15.755 --> 24:18.528
even a chance to prove myself?

24:21.927 --> 24:28.602
I know I appear as an outsider,
but I have dreamt of you all

24:28.603 --> 24:30.001
for a thousand years.

24:31.811 --> 24:35.476
Elijah, when you were
in Esther's womb,

24:35.477 --> 24:38.221
she would ask me to sing to you.

24:38.222 --> 24:41.318
I would feel her belly as I did.

24:41.319 --> 24:44.494
Heh. How you would kick.

24:44.495 --> 24:46.958
She would say, "it was
as if Thor himself

24:46.959 --> 24:48.293
had raised his hammer"...

24:48.294 --> 24:50.731
"And summoned
thunder and lightning."

24:55.402 --> 24:57.001
Mother rarely mentioned you.

24:57.002 --> 24:58.864
When she did, she would say

24:58.865 --> 25:02.472
how enchanted you were by
the prospect of my birth.

25:02.473 --> 25:08.143
How I wanted more brothers
and a sister more than anything,

25:08.144 --> 25:11.847
but between Esther and Dahlia,
that wish was taken from me.

25:11.848 --> 25:14.381
I was ruined by those
who raised me.

25:14.382 --> 25:17.215
If nothing else,
at least we have that in common.

25:20.988 --> 25:25.154
There is nothing that can
replace what was taken from us,

25:25.155 --> 25:29.121
but I hope we can make
something better in its place.

25:29.122 --> 25:32.814
All you have to do is trust me.

25:35.466 --> 25:37.097
Nik!

25:37.098 --> 25:39.279
Well, that's enough
of that, don't you think?

25:42.766 --> 25:45.670
Right. Now we can have
a proper family meeting.

25:52.412 --> 25:54.336
Who was that absolutely
necessary?

25:54.361 --> 25:56.283
Oh, please.
She was insufferable.

25:56.284 --> 25:58.346
That was ridiculous
even for you.

25:58.347 --> 26:00.017
You've only just met her.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.718
Let's not get sentimental.

26:01.743 --> 26:04.214
Besides, if she was telling
the truth about being immortal,

26:04.215 --> 26:05.452
she'll awaken shortly.

26:05.453 --> 26:07.283
If she was lying, good riddance.

26:07.284 --> 26:09.018
Yes. Of course, of she wakes,

26:09.019 --> 26:11.353
she'll be willing to help us
with unbridled enthusiasm.

26:11.378 --> 26:13.718
She played you both for fools.

26:13.719 --> 26:15.022
Can you not see that?

26:15.023 --> 26:17.148
She spins a sad yarn
about a small child

26:17.149 --> 26:19.554
taken by an evil witch, and you
both fall over yourselves

26:19.555 --> 26:20.954
to mend what's broken!

26:20.955 --> 26:22.364
How can you be so certain?

26:22.389 --> 26:24.424
Simple.

26:24.425 --> 26:26.318
It's exactly what I'd do.

26:27.895 --> 26:30.158
My only question now
is what's in it for her.

26:30.159 --> 26:31.495
Well, whatever the truth may be,

26:31.496 --> 26:33.198
she's in no position
to help us now.

26:33.199 --> 26:35.093
Well, then we should try Marcel.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.700
Perhaps he's had
luck on his end.

26:36.701 --> 26:39.634
Surely he's put in
a better effort.

26:42.805 --> 26:45.204
You know I'm right, Elijah.

26:45.205 --> 26:48.108
We can't have an alliance
with someone we can't trust.

26:48.109 --> 26:51.108
You don't trust her,
and that is your choice.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.514
I only hope that choice comes

26:52.515 --> 26:55.943
from a place
of reason, not fear.

27:07.350 --> 27:11.022
Leave it to Marcel to have
the best view in the city.

27:11.023 --> 27:14.925
Sometimes, I forget what
a beautiful city it is,

27:14.926 --> 27:19.065
especially with all
the ugliness that comes with it.

27:19.066 --> 27:20.672
Have you always lived here?

27:20.697 --> 27:24.399
Mm-hmm.
Born and raised in the treme.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.220
Lived through its ups and downs.

27:27.245 --> 27:30.835
Then came the trouble
with the vampires

27:30.836 --> 27:33.971
and some troubles
that was even worse.

27:33.972 --> 27:38.307
I gave up on being a witch,
walked away from my coven.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.979
I guess that's why I was easy
prey for your friend Finn.

27:40.980 --> 27:43.679
Trust me, not my friend.

27:50.983 --> 27:54.164
Marcel was asking
about Eva Sinclair.

27:54.189 --> 27:56.882
You need to tell him
to get back in here.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.085
There's something
he needs to know.

28:05.582 --> 28:08.220
Ah! You're awake.

28:08.221 --> 28:09.987
Well, clearly,
your restorative powers

28:09.988 --> 28:12.322
are not renowned
for their speed.

28:12.323 --> 28:14.601
You dare lay your hands on me.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.995
Well, immortality
is a bold claim.

28:16.996 --> 28:20.763
I had to make sure you
were telling the truth.

28:20.764 --> 28:22.933
Why did you bring me here?

28:22.934 --> 28:25.070
I couldn't very well
have you stay in my home.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.205
That honor is something
I reserve for those

28:27.206 --> 28:30.005
I consider family.

28:30.006 --> 28:31.709
So you refuse me as your sister.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.308
Well, you had a lovely audition.

28:33.309 --> 28:35.497
It just didn't seem
to be the right fit.

28:35.522 --> 28:38.124
I think Elijah felt otherwise.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.550
Rebekah, too.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.086
Yes, you did a fine job
of convincing them

28:41.087 --> 28:42.886
with all
your melodramatic tales.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.421
However, I suspect you
were not entirely forthcoming.

28:46.422 --> 28:48.757
The truth is Elijah and Rebekah

28:48.758 --> 28:52.013
can be a bit naive when it
comes to family relations.

28:52.038 --> 28:55.027
Case in point,
their unending faith in me.

28:55.028 --> 28:57.794
I repay that loyalty
by guarding them

28:57.795 --> 29:00.466
against treachery
they cannot see,

29:00.467 --> 29:04.241
and I sense that you
are treacherous indeed.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.105
You wish to worm
your way into my family.

29:06.106 --> 29:10.576
I want to know why, so,
sister, I'm going to give you

29:10.577 --> 29:13.409
one last chance
to tell the full truth.

29:13.410 --> 29:16.121
I suggest you don't muck it up.

29:23.236 --> 29:26.295
You want to know why
I hate Dahlia?

29:27.129 --> 29:29.046
It goes back to a man.

29:29.465 --> 29:32.887
His name was Mathias.

29:32.888 --> 29:37.592
We knew each other for one
perfect year in the early 1400s.

29:37.593 --> 29:40.654
I loved him more
than my own life,

29:40.655 --> 29:43.924
and Dahlia allowed
me to love him.

29:43.925 --> 29:47.964
Of course. She wanted you
to bear her another firstborn.

29:47.965 --> 29:51.834
I broke my vow
and gave in to love,

29:51.835 --> 29:55.104
and that led to the darkest
moment of my life,

29:55.105 --> 29:57.302
the day when I tried
to steal from Dahlia

29:57.303 --> 29:59.500
that which she wanted most.

29:59.501 --> 30:01.939
And what precisely was that?

30:04.204 --> 30:06.074
My son.

30:08.338 --> 30:12.342
Freya, voice-over: Mathias only
wanted our child to be born free.

30:12.343 --> 30:16.078
For that, Dahlia
cursed him to death.

30:16.079 --> 30:17.982
I knew I'd never be free of her,

30:17.983 --> 30:21.453
that my child
would be born a slave.

30:21.454 --> 30:25.718
To spare us both from the horrors
of the life I'd known,

30:25.719 --> 30:29.060
I took a bottle
of Dahlia's strongest poison.

30:36.867 --> 30:38.745
I gave you everything.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.867
You dare to take what is mine?

30:43.608 --> 30:46.204
Freya, voice-over:
I wanted to die,

30:46.205 --> 30:48.539
for only death could
finally give me

30:48.540 --> 30:50.673
the release I longed for,

30:50.674 --> 30:54.652
but Dahlia knew that my death
was never an option.

30:54.653 --> 30:58.152
That was the day I learned
that I could never die.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.554
How can this be?

31:05.555 --> 31:08.787
How am I alive?

31:08.788 --> 31:10.155
The spell that sealed
our magic sleep

31:10.156 --> 31:14.490
guards us from all
forms of harm...

31:14.491 --> 31:19.452
But the spell did
not protect everyone.

31:24.030 --> 31:26.067
No.

31:26.068 --> 31:29.429
No!

31:29.430 --> 31:31.291
My baby.

31:35.299 --> 31:40.033
Mmm, mmm.
There, there.

31:40.034 --> 31:42.704
There, there, my dear.

31:44.307 --> 31:48.881
I will forgive you
for this eventually,

31:48.882 --> 31:54.553
but you can never forget
there is no escape from me,

31:54.554 --> 31:59.553
not even death.

32:00.062 --> 32:03.198
It was Dahlia who made
me do what I did.

32:03.199 --> 32:08.235
She turned me into a monster,
and I will destroy her for it.

32:08.236 --> 32:14.171
Tell me, brother, is that the truth
you wanted to hear?

32:14.172 --> 32:17.510
Whether I believe
you or not is no matter.

32:17.535 --> 32:21.146
You told that tale in order
to garner my sympathy,

32:21.147 --> 32:24.346
thinking the shared plight of
a child in danger would bond us,

32:24.347 --> 32:28.585
but I will not be manipulated.

32:28.586 --> 32:33.284
Whatever you choose,
one final truth remains.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.020
Dahlia's coming for us.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.252
With me, you have
a chance to defeat her.

32:37.253 --> 32:39.419
Without me, she will
take your daughter

32:39.420 --> 32:40.722
and make her a slave.

32:40.723 --> 32:42.689
She will suffer as I had,

32:42.690 --> 32:44.256
never knowing
her mother and father

32:44.257 --> 32:46.527
because Dahlia will have
rendered you into ash.

32:46.528 --> 32:48.958
Are you quite finished?

32:48.983 --> 32:51.429
If there is to be
an alliance between us,

32:51.430 --> 32:54.997
it will be one of my design...

32:54.998 --> 32:59.997
And if you ever try to
control me again, sister,

33:00.901 --> 33:03.276
you will spend the rest
of your immortal life

33:03.277 --> 33:05.173
regretting it.

33:05.174 --> 33:07.278
Then leave.

33:07.279 --> 33:09.446
I already have Rebekah
and Elijah's trust,

33:09.447 --> 33:15.150
and I'm not going anywhere,
but if I were you, brother,

33:15.151 --> 33:18.491
I'd rethink your alliances
as you go forward.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.290
Marcel: I filled the guy in,

33:23.291 --> 33:24.890
but he's still a little
freaked out about all this.

33:24.891 --> 33:28.593
Good. That makes us
a perfect pair.

33:28.594 --> 33:30.094
Right.

33:31.666 --> 33:34.033
Well, I can tell from your face

33:34.034 --> 33:35.904
that you knew the previous
occupant of this body.

33:35.905 --> 33:39.040
Rest assured, you're now
speaking to Rebekah Mikaelson.

33:39.041 --> 33:40.505
So who are you?

33:40.506 --> 33:42.610
I mean, now that you're
not my brother Finn.

33:42.611 --> 33:43.930
Vincent Griffith.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.653
I would say, "at your service,"

33:45.654 --> 33:47.952
but, uh, that implies I
had a choice in the matter.

33:47.953 --> 33:51.793
Ooh! He's witty.
Wonderful.

33:51.794 --> 33:54.732
Now I hear you have
some information for me.

33:54.757 --> 33:57.035
Just give me a second.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.410
When they put Eva
in the fauline cottage,

34:07.411 --> 34:09.849
I never thought
I'd see her again.

34:09.850 --> 34:13.478
How exactly is it
that you knew miss Sinclair?

34:17.583 --> 34:19.547
She was my wife.

34:21.820 --> 34:26.848
Well, that is bloody fantastic,
isn't it?

34:32.230 --> 34:33.668
We need to talk.

34:34.766 --> 34:37.533
Do we indeed?

34:37.534 --> 34:39.867
Have you come to
express your gratitude

34:39.868 --> 34:41.938
at the courtesy I've
shown your husband,

34:41.938 --> 34:43.906
or perhaps you want to thank me

34:43.931 --> 34:46.474
for my efforts to protect
you and your pack.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.913
All this tension with you,
Jack, and the wolves,

34:48.914 --> 34:50.976
we need to put it behind us.

34:50.976 --> 34:54.878
Give Jack the space he needs
to run the pack as he sees fit.

34:54.879 --> 34:57.085
No more orders, no more favors.

34:57.110 --> 34:59.453
He's Alpha period.

34:59.454 --> 35:02.387
Heh heh heh.
I'm sorry.

35:02.388 --> 35:04.722
Did you really think
I would ever agree

35:04.723 --> 35:07.891
to let Jackson
control the wolves?

35:07.892 --> 35:09.640
You will show him
respect, Klaus.

35:09.665 --> 35:11.692
He is on our side, and he's
fighting for our daughter.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.500
You know, I've spent
all day with people

35:14.501 --> 35:16.565
who claim to be fighting
for our daughter.

35:16.566 --> 35:20.405
Some I trust, some I do not,
but one thing is for sure,

35:20.406 --> 35:22.207
that there is only one person

35:22.208 --> 35:25.312
that I trust when it comes
to my child's safety,

35:25.313 --> 35:28.826
and that would be me!

35:28.851 --> 35:31.657
You know, you all seem to
think this is a democracy.

35:31.658 --> 35:33.186
I assure you it is not!

35:33.187 --> 35:36.162
If Dahlia is coming, then
she is a threat to my child,

35:36.163 --> 35:40.899
which means I decide how to
protect her, no one else!

35:40.900 --> 35:44.234
And if Jackson or anyone strays
from the course that I set,

35:44.235 --> 35:46.770
then they will answer to me.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.969
Now your husband would
do well to remember that.

35:48.970 --> 35:51.408
In fact, I think I'll leave
it to you to remind him.

35:51.409 --> 35:54.519
That way, when he does
inevitably incur my wrath again,

35:54.544 --> 35:57.938
you'll only have
yourself to blame.

36:14.424 --> 36:19.728
After today, I could
use a drink.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.392
I see Marcel let you out.

36:21.393 --> 36:28.074
Yeah. He's got a sense
of reciprocity for a vampire.

36:28.075 --> 36:31.075
I told him what I knew,
but if Eva's coming back here,

36:31.076 --> 36:32.379
I don't want anything
to do with her.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.183
Too much history.

36:36.815 --> 36:41.917
Ooh. As for you, stay
away from that crowd.

36:41.918 --> 36:44.777
Do like me.
Make it a clean break.

36:44.802 --> 36:48.495
Not the first time
I've heard that advice,

36:48.496 --> 36:52.662
but if there's one thing
I've learned in this town,

36:52.663 --> 36:54.837
we do better
when we're not alone.

37:09.712 --> 37:12.079
I appreciate you
escorting me home.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.280
Given that there's a witch
inside me trying to break out,

37:15.281 --> 37:17.690
I probably shouldn't
be alone right now.

37:17.691 --> 37:20.994
You're gonna be ok, I promise.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.663
Funny, isn't it?

37:25.664 --> 37:27.032
I've lived a thousand years,

37:27.033 --> 37:31.245
and now I'm stuck in a body
that might swallow me whole.

37:31.246 --> 37:33.551
Of course,
if Josephine Larue gets her way,

37:33.552 --> 37:36.579
I'll be heading back
to that witchy asylum.

37:36.604 --> 37:39.361
That's not gonna happen.

37:39.362 --> 37:42.761
The point is,
for the first time in ages,

37:42.762 --> 37:47.800
I'm quite vulnerable,
weak even.

37:47.801 --> 37:49.367
It's an uncomfortable
moment realizing

37:49.368 --> 37:51.668
that you're genuinely afraid.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.873
It's ok to be scared...

38:04.257 --> 38:11.480
And we are all vulnerable,
but weak, no.

38:11.481 --> 38:13.320
Let me tell you something.

38:13.321 --> 38:17.918
Klaus is the smartest
person I've ever met.

38:17.919 --> 38:23.857
Elijah is... The stuffiest.

38:23.858 --> 38:25.711
You're the strongest...

38:27.267 --> 38:29.382
No matter what body you're in.

38:32.843 --> 38:35.010
You need anything?

38:35.011 --> 38:37.056
Perhaps I could use a drink.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.747
Sure.

38:38.748 --> 38:40.915
Be but a moment, milady.

38:49.924 --> 38:51.594
Ohh!

39:01.133 --> 39:02.436
You all right?

39:02.437 --> 39:04.773
I honestly don't know.

39:04.774 --> 39:06.940
I keep having flashes of memory,

39:06.941 --> 39:09.210
but they fade almost
as soon as I've had them.

39:11.011 --> 39:13.347
I don't suppose you'd
mind staying

39:13.348 --> 39:14.884
just to keep an eye on me.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.755
Yeah. I'm not gonna go anywhere,
all right?

39:42.521 --> 39:44.021
Rebekah?

39:55.217 --> 39:58.350
So this is where you live.

39:58.351 --> 40:01.124
It's nicer on the inside.

40:01.125 --> 40:04.421
Can I help you, Niklaus, or did
you cross the river purely

40:04.422 --> 40:06.187
to critique my decor?

40:06.188 --> 40:09.050
I thought you might like to know
I was moved by what you said

40:09.051 --> 40:12.693
about my decision not to
trust our long lost sister,

40:12.718 --> 40:16.113
so I waited until she revived,
and when she did,

40:16.138 --> 40:17.894
we had quite a chat.

40:17.895 --> 40:20.294
And your position
remains unchanged?

40:20.295 --> 40:24.596
I looked in her eyes,
and I saw only anger and fear,

40:24.597 --> 40:26.795
the will to do whatever
it takes to survive

40:26.796 --> 40:28.666
no matter who she hurts.

40:28.667 --> 40:31.568
I can use her to my own ends,

40:31.569 --> 40:33.903
but I could never allow
so damaged a creature

40:33.904 --> 40:36.565
to have a say in my plans.

40:36.566 --> 40:39.902
You may not trust her,
but trust me, brother.

40:39.903 --> 40:41.677
We may have had
our differences of late,

40:41.678 --> 40:43.405
but we shall exercise
the same caution

40:43.406 --> 40:46.978
we have always demonstrated
towards our allies.

40:46.979 --> 40:51.283
Fine. I'll let you pursue it,
but should Freya betray us...

40:51.284 --> 40:52.883
If Freya should even
attempt to betray us,

40:52.884 --> 40:56.484
I shall bury her beneath
a thousand wretched torments.

40:56.485 --> 41:01.092
I don't doubt it,
but what if you're too late?

41:01.093 --> 41:03.164
What if Freya is duplicitous?

41:03.165 --> 41:06.365
What if hope should be
harmed through her actions?

41:06.366 --> 41:08.469
You won't have to worry
that I will never forgive you

41:08.470 --> 41:10.868
because you will never
forgive yourself.

41:10.869 --> 41:14.801
You will suffer a guilt
that will be impossible to endure.

41:18.608 --> 41:22.804
A terrible fate
for one who cannot die.

41:22.805 --> 41:26.609
Nothing will happen
to that child,

41:26.610 --> 41:27.977
but we have to
consider every weapon

41:27.978 --> 41:29.576
at our disposal, brother.

41:29.577 --> 41:32.148
Dahlia is coming.

41:33.966 --> 41:35.646
The only question is when.
