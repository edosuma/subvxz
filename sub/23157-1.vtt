00:45.326 --> 00:48.261
It's funny the things a grown man
will do for a living.

00:48.329 --> 00:52.959
Especially me. Take this morning, I'm
breaking into Robin Masters's estate.

00:53.034 --> 00:56.060
You know, the writer.
The one with all those best sellers.

00:56.137 --> 00:58.367
All that money.

00:58.439 --> 01:02.273
No, that's not Robin.
That's ex-Sergeant Major Higgins.

01:02.343 --> 01:04.777
He's sort of the majordomo
around here.

01:04.846 --> 01:06.973
Robin flies in
once or twice a year.

01:07.048 --> 01:09.346
The rest of the time
the estate is open to his friends.

01:10.418 --> 01:13.751
Higgins's job is to see
that they're well bedded,

01:13.821 --> 01:17.848
fed, watered and protected.

01:17.925 --> 01:21.952
Zeus! Apollo!
At your posts, lads!

01:26.601 --> 01:30.594
Me? I live here too.
So, why am I breaking in?

01:30.671 --> 01:33.834
Well, I made a deal with Robin
to run a series of security checks...

01:33.908 --> 01:36.968
in exchange for living free
in the guesthouse.

01:37.044 --> 01:39.740
First check was to
try and steal the Ferrari.

01:39.814 --> 01:41.941
I thought I made
a pretty good deal.

01:42.016 --> 01:44.382
Then I met Higgins.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.649
He takes his job
much too seriously.

01:50.224 --> 01:52.590
Morning, me beauties.

01:57.732 --> 02:01.896
Like I said, funny the things
a grown man will do for a living.

02:03.104 --> 02:05.334
But I've done funnier.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.817
Go, lads!

03:09.337 --> 03:11.828
Hi, guys.

03:23.718 --> 03:25.982
Zeus? Apollo?

04:12.967 --> 04:14.901
Don't look at the dogs,
work the lock.

04:17.038 --> 04:19.733
Work the lock. Work the lock.
Don't look at the dogs.

04:19.807 --> 04:23.072
You looked at the dogs.

04:25.146 --> 04:28.309
Sometimes everything goes
exactly as planned.

04:29.417 --> 04:32.079
Sometimes it doesn't.

04:32.153 --> 04:34.747
Overnight, Higgins had installed
an alarm system.

04:34.822 --> 04:36.756
It activated the moment
I opened the door,

04:36.824 --> 04:40.453
which meant I had less than a minute
to figure the combination.

04:40.528 --> 04:42.962
After that, a siren would go off,
the fuel pump would lock...

04:43.030 --> 04:46.295
and it would take nitro
to move Robin's Ferrari.

04:48.669 --> 04:51.069
Hi. You here for the weekend?
Hi.

04:51.138 --> 04:53.902
Yeah. It's a great place. You'll love it.
It's got everything.

04:53.975 --> 04:57.001
You wouldn't happen to know the
combination of this alarm, would you?

04:57.078 --> 04:59.012
Are you stealing Robin's car?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.776
Uh, no. Well, sort of,
but it's okay.

05:01.849 --> 05:04.943
It's a security check.
It's just sort of a game.

05:05.019 --> 05:09.456
Higgins would have picked a number that
he was familiar with, like the address.

05:12.059 --> 05:13.993
Or the zip code.

05:14.061 --> 05:16.427
Or maybe
his social security number.

05:16.497 --> 05:19.022
- You know his social security number?
- No.

05:23.671 --> 05:28.836
The phone. He used Robin
Masters's personal phone number.

05:31.045 --> 05:34.037
No!

05:34.115 --> 05:36.049
I'd invite you girls to breakfast,

05:36.117 --> 05:39.177
but I gotta pick up a buddy
flying in from Tokyo.

05:41.522 --> 05:44.320
Don't worry, Higgins.
I'll drive careful.

05:55.236 --> 05:58.069
Higgins, you yo-yo.

06:03.577 --> 06:06.307
Give it up, lads.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.712
If you're wondering
how I could be so sure...

06:08.783 --> 06:10.876
the combination
was the phone number,

06:10.951 --> 06:13.112
if it wasn't,
Higgins would have won.

06:13.187 --> 06:16.315
And fate just wouldn't
do that to me.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.449
Welcome to Oahu.

08:00.528 --> 08:04.055
Although you are military personnel
and Hickam is a military field,

08:04.131 --> 08:06.099
you'll still have to go through
U.S. Customs,

08:06.167 --> 08:10.194
which won't look the other way just
because we're both paid by Uncle Sam.

08:10.271 --> 08:13.035
So, if you're carrying
any illegal souvenirs from Japan,

08:13.107 --> 08:15.940
I suggest you leave them
on the aircraft.

08:17.278 --> 08:19.610
This briefcase
your only luggage, Lieutenant?

08:19.680 --> 08:21.705
That's it.

08:21.782 --> 08:24.444
You have a release for these?
They're photocopies.

08:24.518 --> 08:27.715
But of what, Lieutenant?
I don't read Japanese.

08:29.623 --> 08:31.716
I guess it's okay.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.317
Thanks.

08:37.030 --> 08:38.965
What's he, C.I.A.?

08:39.033 --> 08:41.524
N.I.A. The navy's version.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.935
Might be a few minutes late
picking Dan up,

08:45.005 --> 08:47.701
but, uh, when he saw the Ferrari,
he'd forgive me.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.139
Ski! Lieutenant Magnum.

08:55.216 --> 08:57.150
It's not lieutenant
anymore, Ski.

08:57.218 --> 08:59.243
You know, I haven't seen you
since you beached yourself,

08:59.320 --> 09:01.618
what, uh, four, five months ago?
More like a year.

09:01.689 --> 09:05.056
I heard you're playing like a detective.
Investigator, Ski.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.059
Private investigator.

09:07.127 --> 09:09.254
Look. Lieutenant Cook's comin' in
from Tokyo on a max flight.

09:09.330 --> 09:12.424
I gotta pick him up.
If I go through Hickam's main gate,

09:12.499 --> 09:14.899
I'm gonna be filling out paper
till next Sunday.

09:14.969 --> 09:18.530
No sweat, Lieutenant. This oughta get you
just about anywhere on Pearl or Hickam.

09:18.606 --> 09:21.871
Thanks, Ski. Nice set of wheels you
got here. Where'd you steal her?

09:21.942 --> 09:23.933
What makes you think
she isn't mine?

09:26.680 --> 09:30.013
- No!
- Geez.

09:30.084 --> 09:34.043
Halt. Are you Lieutenant Cook?
Sir.

09:34.121 --> 09:36.055
Captain Cooly would like to
see you right away, sir.

09:36.123 --> 09:38.557
Captain Cooly. What, now?
Yes, sir.

09:38.626 --> 09:41.060
Uh, I have a vehicle
waiting right here, sir.

10:01.482 --> 10:05.384
Magnum. Pull over, driver.
That's the guy that's meeting me.

10:05.452 --> 10:09.320
How did he get that car?
I said pull over, driver.

10:09.390 --> 10:11.483
Can't do that, Lieutenant.

10:11.558 --> 10:13.583
What do you mean
you can't do that?

10:13.661 --> 10:16.824
Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:11.185 --> 11:13.483
Have a nice day, brahda.

11:20.083 --> 11:23.280
Magnum! Mag...

11:35.426 --> 11:38.884
I understand, sir, that the medical examiners
here got all the tough cases from Vietnam.

11:38.963 --> 11:41.659
The ones they couldn't identify
through dog tags and dental records.

11:41.732 --> 11:44.394
You know, they put a name on everybody?
Every single one.

11:44.468 --> 11:47.801
It's probably the first time in the history
of warfare every K.I.A. has been identified.

11:47.871 --> 11:49.930
Too damn bad.
Beg your pardon, sir?

11:50.007 --> 11:52.373
There'll be no monuments erected to
the boys that fought in Vietnam.

11:52.443 --> 11:57.039
Hippies have seen to that. The most we could
expect was to share in a little glory...

11:57.114 --> 12:01.107
to have buried an unidentified body from that war
besides the others at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

12:01.185 --> 12:03.380
These medical examiners
deprived us of that, Ensign.

12:03.454 --> 12:06.252
I see what you mean, sir.

12:06.323 --> 12:08.621
There is evidence of a small
abdominal wall hematoma,

12:08.692 --> 12:11.126
suggesting blunt-force trauma.

12:11.195 --> 12:13.322
He may have been punched
in the stomach.

12:13.397 --> 12:16.560
Almost done, Captain.
Found a cause of death yet?

12:16.934 --> 12:21.837
Massive pulmonary edema and cyanosis,
probably induced by cocaine.

12:21.905 --> 12:23.839
What?

12:23.907 --> 12:26.239
We found a dozen plastic packets
in his stomach.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.403
Some of them burst.
I'm having them analyzed now,

12:28.479 --> 12:31.141
but odds are
they contained cocaine.

12:31.215 --> 12:36.243
How did packets of cocaine
get into Lieutenant Cook's stomach?

12:36.320 --> 12:39.847
It happens all the time, I'm afraid. Swallow
the packets before boarding the plane,

12:39.923 --> 12:43.188
then retrieve the packets
from the digestive system.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.956
Uh, it's a foolproof way
of smuggling everything...

12:46.030 --> 12:49.761
- from dope to diamonds.
- Are you sure it's cocaine?

12:49.833 --> 12:52.734
I'm waiting for the tox screen and
the residue analysis to confirm it.

12:53.737 --> 12:55.864
This is going to be very hard
on Admiral Cook.

12:55.939 --> 12:59.204
- His father is Admiral Raleigh Cook?
- Uh, yes, sir.

13:02.112 --> 13:06.412
Does the admiral have to be informed of...
all the details, sir?

13:06.483 --> 13:09.543
What do you suggest, Ensign?
We tell him his son swallowed...

13:09.620 --> 13:11.850
a dozen cocaine packets
by mistake?

13:11.922 --> 13:14.083
No, sir.
I mean, the lieutenant's dead.

13:14.158 --> 13:17.025
I just thought we could get
around some of the details.

13:17.094 --> 13:21.087
It could be done, Captain, unless Admiral
Cook pushed for more information.

13:21.165 --> 13:25.625
We could release it as an accidental
overdose, which of course it was.

13:25.702 --> 13:28.432
I don't think he planned
on the packets bursting.

13:31.642 --> 13:35.203
Ensign Healy, first thing in the morning, I
wanna draw up a letter of recommendation.

13:35.279 --> 13:37.338
- Sir?
- I'm gonna recommend...

13:37.414 --> 13:40.474
Lieutenant Cook's military rights
and benefits be revoked.

13:40.551 --> 13:43.543
This officer died in the commission of
a felony. He disgraced his uniform.

13:43.620 --> 13:47.420
If he were alive, I'd court-martial
him and I'd deep-six him.

13:48.892 --> 13:52.089
His being dead doesn't change
that, no matter whose son he is.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.096
Good night, gentlemen.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.969
I don't know what you did
to your C.O., son,

14:00.037 --> 14:02.938
but you sure ticked him off.

14:14.051 --> 14:16.315
Hi, guys. Higgins!

14:16.386 --> 14:19.219
Higgins.!

14:20.424 --> 14:22.415
Higgins.!

14:23.594 --> 14:25.789
Zeus! Apollo! Bad dogs!

14:25.863 --> 14:28.195
Let the nice man out of the car.

14:28.265 --> 14:31.496
Oh, it's all right.
The dogs will stay with us.

14:31.568 --> 14:34.594
They seem to like you. ja.

14:34.671 --> 14:36.969
Uh, why don't they like me?

14:37.040 --> 14:40.134
Mr. Higgins doesn't like you,
and they're his dogs.

14:40.210 --> 14:44.647
I think he tells them bad things about you.
I think you're right.

14:45.716 --> 14:50.176
Zeus! Apollo!
Where are you, lads?

14:50.254 --> 14:52.620
It's all right, Higgins.
They're with me.

14:52.689 --> 14:55.055
Right.

14:57.427 --> 15:00.362
Thanks for the escort.
Now that I'm safely home,

15:00.430 --> 15:02.796
you can go back to your swim.

15:02.866 --> 15:05.596
The tidal pool sure looks
good in the moonlight.

15:05.669 --> 15:09.161
Yes, it's going to be nice to get out
of the suits and back in the water.

15:10.574 --> 15:12.405
Yeah, why don't you join us?

15:12.476 --> 15:15.343
Oh, sure, great.
I'll just get my trunks.

15:16.747 --> 15:18.715
If you wish.

16:07.798 --> 16:10.062
Pearl Harbor Naval Base.

16:10.133 --> 16:12.533
Uh, Lieutenant Cook,
Bachelor Officers' Quarters, please.

16:12.603 --> 16:15.538
One moment, please. It's
extension number... No, wait.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.476
Hello?

16:32.656 --> 16:34.590
Hello?

16:44.768 --> 16:47.430
Hello?

16:54.578 --> 16:56.808
Lieutenant Cook's quarters.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.246
You're gonna wish you didn't stand
me up at the airport, old buddy.

16:59.316 --> 17:02.308
Who's this? This is Magnum.
Who are you?

17:02.486 --> 17:05.011
Magnum, this is Ensign Healy.

17:05.088 --> 17:07.454
I came aboard a couple weeks
before you left, remember?

17:07.523 --> 17:09.753
Oh, Healy, yeah.
L.S.U. quarterback, right?

17:09.826 --> 17:12.795
Right. Well, put Lieutenant
Cook on, will ya?

17:14.498 --> 17:18.127
I'm sorry, Magnum, I can't.
He's dead.

17:19.869 --> 17:22.634
Magnum? Did you hear me?

17:22.705 --> 17:25.698
Homeward Angel, do you read me?

17:25.776 --> 17:29.234
Homeward Angel. Homeward
Angel, do you read me?

17:30.247 --> 17:32.511
Homeward Angel. Homeward
Angel, do you read me?

17:34.985 --> 17:36.919
Homeward Angel, do you read me?

17:36.987 --> 17:39.217
Homeward Angel, do you read me?

17:48.832 --> 17:51.494
Hi, guys. Magnum,
you're late again.

17:51.568 --> 17:54.264
You know, Dan,
I've been thinking.

17:54.338 --> 17:57.171
Yeah, I know. You wanna resign.

17:57.240 --> 18:02.906
Well, it's not that I don't appreciate what
the navy's done for me... college education,

18:02.979 --> 18:05.447
foreign travel, nice uniform.

18:05.515 --> 18:09.281
Magnum, every time we get
shot up, you wanna resign.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.287
You think I'm crazy, huh?

18:11.355 --> 18:13.619
Hell, no. The reason I'm here...

18:13.690 --> 18:16.716
is because my old man
expects it out of me.

18:16.793 --> 18:19.557
Phillipe and Pepe
don't know anything else.

18:19.629 --> 18:21.620
They've been fighting Charlie
since they were 10.

18:21.698 --> 18:24.895
Eight. Homeward Angel,
do you read me?

18:24.968 --> 18:26.902
You got nothing holding you.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.904
You put in your tour.
You can get out.

18:28.972 --> 18:31.304
Can't do that. Why not?

18:31.375 --> 18:33.502
We're a team.
Can't split up the team.

18:33.577 --> 18:35.977
Only thing keeping
you guys alive is me.

18:40.588 --> 18:43.250
Wonder if T.C. forgot
to set his alarm again.

18:46.356 --> 18:50.884
For Washington, D.C.
and San Francisco...

18:50.961 --> 18:55.489
is now arriving at Gate 7
on the upper concourse.

18:56.733 --> 19:01.602
All night long, one thought
ran over and over through my head.

19:01.672 --> 19:04.641
If I'd been on time, maybe...

19:04.708 --> 19:08.508
somehow I could have
saved Dan's life.

19:08.578 --> 19:11.911
Made meeting his father
and sister even tougher.

19:11.982 --> 19:15.577
Admiral Cook I could talk to,
but Alice.

19:16.987 --> 19:19.979
What do you say
to your buddy's kid sister?

19:24.428 --> 19:28.592
Nancy Swindell, please report
to Baggage Checkpoint ""A. '"

19:28.665 --> 19:31.532
Nancy Swindell,
to Baggage Check ""A. '"

19:37.708 --> 19:39.642
Alice?

19:42.245 --> 19:44.213
Thomas.

19:44.281 --> 19:47.307
You look terrific.
Doesn't he look terrific?

19:47.384 --> 19:50.182
T-Terrific. And big too.

19:50.253 --> 19:53.984
Oh, yeah.
Tom always was a big'un.

19:54.057 --> 19:58.118
- Where's your father?
- Washington. Senate hearings.

19:59.563 --> 20:03.431
Oh, um, Thomas Magnum,
I'd like you to meet Sam.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.992
Uh, Jones. Sam Jones.
Industrial grommets.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.402
That's right. Sam Jones,
"industrial gommets."

20:09.473 --> 20:12.567
Thomas Magnum, Sam Jones.

20:12.642 --> 20:15.941
Tom.

20:27.157 --> 20:29.148
Oh!

20:29.226 --> 20:31.160
We had just a little
too much to drink.

20:31.228 --> 20:33.162
Let's get your bags
and some air.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.461
Uh, here, listen.
I was going to get her bags.

20:36.533 --> 20:39.331
I didn't know her boyfriend
was meeting her.

20:39.403 --> 20:43.100
Are you my boyfriend, Thomas?

20:43.173 --> 20:46.074
Well, are you?

20:50.414 --> 20:52.780
The first time
we were stationed at Pearl,

20:52.849 --> 20:56.649
I was four and Dan was nine.

20:56.720 --> 21:01.054
That was when Dad
had command of, uh...

21:01.124 --> 21:03.319
I don't even remember.
Which carrier was that, Thomas?

21:03.393 --> 21:07.523
The Princeton.
That's right. The Sweet Pea.

21:07.597 --> 21:11.863
I remember Mom had to... had to
join Dad a little bit before us,

21:11.935 --> 21:14.369
so they could find a place
for us to live and everything.

21:14.438 --> 21:19.501
And that meant that... that Dan and
I got to fly out all by ourselves.

21:19.576 --> 21:22.067
Dan and Alice. Just...

21:22.145 --> 21:24.045
Alice and Dan.

21:24.114 --> 21:26.074
All the way from Aunt Helen's
in Columbus, Ohio...

21:26.116 --> 21:29.176
to Honolulu, O"ahu.

21:32.389 --> 21:34.619
God, I was so scared.

21:37.828 --> 21:41.059
You know what Dan did?
What'd he do, Alice?

21:41.131 --> 21:43.065
He held my hand.

21:45.001 --> 21:48.732
For 14 hours, he held my hand.

21:48.805 --> 21:51.239
Just so that I wouldn't be scared.

21:53.276 --> 21:56.006
All the way
from Columbus to Hawaii.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.183
I don't think
I ever thanked him for that.

22:15.298 --> 22:18.995
Something just went out of Dad
when he got the word.

22:19.069 --> 22:21.867
Something I don't think
will ever come back.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.738
Suddenly he's old.

22:25.809 --> 22:28.403
Come on, Alice.
The admiral will outlive us both.

22:28.478 --> 22:30.946
No. No, he won't, Tom.

22:32.949 --> 22:36.077
It's terrible to say this,
but I think if...

22:36.152 --> 22:38.552
if Dan had died when the two
of you were in Vietnam,

22:38.622 --> 22:40.886
Dad could have handled that.

22:42.526 --> 22:44.460
Not like this.

22:44.528 --> 22:47.497
For God's sake, Alice, you don't believe
what Cooly released to the press?

22:47.564 --> 22:51.557
That's just to let the people who
murdered Dan think they got away with it.

22:51.635 --> 22:53.694
Did Captain Cooly tell you that?

22:53.770 --> 22:57.069
Alice, the navy and I aren't exactly
on speaking terms since I resigned,

22:57.140 --> 22:59.301
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

22:59.376 --> 23:01.571
Tom,

23:01.645 --> 23:04.239
Dad was officially informed
by Captain Cooly...

23:04.314 --> 23:08.808
that Dan died when drugs he was
smuggling in his stomach...

23:08.885 --> 23:11.251
got absorbed into his system.

23:11.321 --> 23:14.916
The navy's not even gonna let us
bury him with military honors.

23:14.991 --> 23:19.087
That's crazy. What did Cooly say
when the admiral called him?

23:21.231 --> 23:23.165
Dad never called.

23:23.233 --> 23:27.829
Alice, your father is a retired war hero.
He's a flag officer to boot.

23:27.904 --> 23:31.203
Now he could get the Seventh Fleet moved here
if that's what it took to find Dan's killers.

23:31.274 --> 23:33.799
Sure he could, but he won't.

23:33.877 --> 23:37.369
For God's sake, why not?
Because what if it's true?

23:37.447 --> 23:39.745
What if Dan was smuggling?

23:39.816 --> 23:41.750
I don't believe you said that.

23:41.818 --> 23:46.881
I did not say it. My father said it.
Tom, look.

23:46.957 --> 23:50.984
Part of Dad knows that Dan
could never do anything like that.

23:51.061 --> 23:54.462
But that other part of him,
that navy part of him,

23:54.531 --> 23:58.365
that military man just cannot
disbelieve an official report...

23:58.435 --> 24:01.836
that is signed by Captain Cooly and a navy
doctor and half a dozen other people.

24:01.905 --> 24:03.839
Now you tell me,
are they all lying?

24:03.907 --> 24:05.841
I don't know. Maybe.

24:05.909 --> 24:08.275
But we'll never find out
if somebody doesn't challenge them.

24:08.345 --> 24:11.337
Well, it is not going to be Dad.

24:11.414 --> 24:13.939
You mean he's just going to
accept that report?

24:15.018 --> 24:16.952
Yes.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.250
But he's hoping you won't.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.798
Excu... Excuse me!

24:28.865 --> 24:32.460
What's this crap
about Dan Cook smuggling coke?

24:32.535 --> 24:35.561
Sorry, sir. He never stopped.
It's all right. It's all right.

24:35.639 --> 24:38.665
It's all right. Now return
to your desk, Bellman.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.946
You know, Magnum,
one of my fondest memories...

24:44.014 --> 24:45.948
will always be the day
you resigned your commission.

24:46.016 --> 24:48.336
Watching the shore patrol
toss your butt off this station...

24:48.351 --> 24:50.410
You want to tell me
why you're writing Dan off,

24:50.487 --> 24:52.978
or do you want the shore patrol
to charge me with assault?

25:09.039 --> 25:12.531
Oh, for God's sakes.
You don't actually believe...

25:12.609 --> 25:17.137
that Dan Cook swallowed a dozen packets of
coke to smuggle it in the Islands, do you?

25:17.213 --> 25:19.738
It's rather disgusting
when you think about it, but yes.

25:19.816 --> 25:22.410
And it's rather stupid,
considering his N.I.A. clearance...

25:22.485 --> 25:25.079
could have got him past any
custom check in the free world.

25:25.155 --> 25:27.453
He wasn't in Tokyo
on an N.I.A. investigation...

25:27.524 --> 25:30.186
because I didn't assign him anything that
would take him beyond the main gate.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.194
It's right in the report there.

25:32.262 --> 25:34.196
I don't give a damn
what's in the report!

25:34.264 --> 25:37.358
Dan Cook was in Tokyo
on a navy investigation,

25:37.434 --> 25:40.528
not to smuggle.
How do you know that?

25:40.603 --> 25:42.798
Because he wired me in Tokyo
to pick him up at the airport.

25:42.872 --> 25:45.500
He said he was on an important case.
He wanted my help.

25:45.575 --> 25:48.976
What case? I don't know.
He never met me.

25:49.045 --> 25:51.104
You don't know?

25:51.181 --> 25:54.412
You barge into this office.
You threaten me.

25:54.484 --> 25:57.749
You accuse me of not doing my duty,
and all you can say is you don't know.

25:57.821 --> 26:01.689
Captain Cooly, look. I realize
that you never liked Dan or me,

26:01.758 --> 26:04.352
but you can't let
a petty jealousy interfere...

26:04.427 --> 26:07.419
Petty jealousy? Petty?

26:10.600 --> 26:14.764
Here. Look. You see this?

26:14.838 --> 26:18.433
It took me three wars
and 30 years to earn this.

26:18.508 --> 26:23.810
That's 30 years of sweating, of bleeding,
laughing at stupid admirals' jokes,

26:23.880 --> 26:26.644
volunteering to serve on the
rust buckets of this navy.

26:26.716 --> 26:29.708
I figured it'd take the two of
you half that to make captain.

26:29.786 --> 26:33.483
What are you? Hmm?
Are you smarter than me?

26:33.556 --> 26:35.524
Are you better sailors?
More dedicated officers?

26:35.592 --> 26:38.220
No. I'll tell you what you were, mister.
You were connected.

26:38.294 --> 26:40.922
Captain Cooly. Who got the two
of you appointed to Annapolis?

26:40.997 --> 26:45.195
Who got your Navy Crosses approved? Who was gonna get you
your scrambled eggs in half the time it takes to earn them?

26:45.268 --> 26:48.066
I'll tell you who... Admiral
Raleigh Cook, that's who.

26:48.138 --> 26:51.266
Now not covering up for his son may seem
like petty jealousy to you, mister,

26:51.341 --> 26:54.401
but to me, it's poetic justice.

26:59.282 --> 27:03.343
Now, since you are no longer a part of this
man's navy, get your butt off this station.

27:03.419 --> 27:06.219
If you ever show it here again,
I'm gonna charge you with everything...

27:06.222 --> 27:08.918
from espionage
to indecent exposure.

27:08.992 --> 27:11.859
You hear me, mister?

27:15.131 --> 27:17.497
Loud and clear.

27:17.567 --> 27:20.832
Dan Cook was murdered,
and I'm gonna prove it.

27:20.904 --> 27:22.895
And when I do,
you can kiss those gold stripes...

27:22.972 --> 27:26.601
you spent 30 years
egg-sucking' for good-bye.

27:43.326 --> 27:45.419
Hey, L.S.U., buy you a beer?

27:45.495 --> 27:50.364
Ah, sorry, late for a date. Maybe
some other time. See y'all later.

28:04.614 --> 28:08.141
Come on, one beer!

28:11.521 --> 28:13.751
Come on, Magnum.
Gimme a break, will ya?

28:13.823 --> 28:17.315
I told you he wasn't on any
official investigation in Tokyo.

28:17.393 --> 28:21.762
Oh, come on. He didn't fly up and
back in 24 hours on an R& R.

28:21.831 --> 28:24.664
Magnum, he was smuggling coke.

28:24.734 --> 28:28.465
Dan Cook and I ate, played, worked
and damn near died together.

28:28.538 --> 28:31.666
He was closer to me than a brother, and
I'm telling you he wasn't a coke runner.

28:31.741 --> 28:34.938
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down.

28:36.012 --> 28:37.940
What do you want from me?

28:37.965 --> 28:40.214
I want Dan's case files.

28:41.551 --> 28:45.544
I don't believe this.

28:48.175 --> 28:51.406
Look, Magnum, I can get my butt
in big trouble just talking to you.

28:51.478 --> 28:53.412
I didn't know Lieutenant Cook
all that well.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.710
We served in the same outfit,
that's all.

28:55.782 --> 28:59.149
He seemed like a real nice guy,
but he wasn't a close friend.

28:59.219 --> 29:02.416
And I'm not gonna risk scuttling my naval
career by hacking off the C.O., okay?

29:02.489 --> 29:04.855
Okay. So he wasn't a buddy.

29:04.925 --> 29:07.018
He was a fellow officer,
and somebody killed him.

29:07.094 --> 29:10.086
I don't know that.
I saw the autopsy report.

29:10.164 --> 29:12.962
How do you explain the fact that he
had bruises on his stomach lining?

29:13.033 --> 29:14.967
Somebody punched him.

29:15.035 --> 29:17.902
Maybe he tripped and fell against
something. On his stomach?

29:17.971 --> 29:20.064
Okay, okay.

29:20.140 --> 29:22.506
Well, I mean, even if he
was punched, so what?

29:22.576 --> 29:25.909
Nobody stuffs 10 ounces of coke
down your gut just to kill ya.

29:25.979 --> 29:27.913
Come on. It's worth too much.

29:29.516 --> 29:33.919
What if 10 ounces is nothing compared
to what you could sell on the market?

29:35.122 --> 29:37.750
Come on, Magnum. That's really reaching.
Don't you think?

29:37.824 --> 29:40.122
Yeah, but it's possible.

29:40.194 --> 29:43.220
Okay, okay, Magnum.
I'll admit. It's possible.

29:43.297 --> 29:46.095
All right then, help me. At least
tell me what Dan was working on.

29:46.166 --> 29:49.624
Nothing.
At least nothing important.

29:49.703 --> 29:53.139
Captain Cooly treated Lieutenant Cook
like some wet-behind-the-ears ensign.

29:53.207 --> 29:57.439
He had him doing all kinds of things.
Checking out footlocker thefts,

29:57.511 --> 30:02.278
penny-ante pilfering,
uh, falsified dependent claims.

30:02.349 --> 30:05.375
I mean, every petty job
except scraping barnacles.

30:06.453 --> 30:08.453
Maybe that's why I never
got to know him that well.

30:08.455 --> 30:11.720
He was always on the old man's list, and I
wasn't about to make it by association,

30:11.792 --> 30:13.760
if you know what I mean.
Yeah, I know.

30:13.827 --> 30:16.990
But I also know that Dan Cook
was in Tokyo on official business,

30:17.064 --> 30:19.089
no matter what Cooly says.

30:19.166 --> 30:22.431
Now there had to be something in
Japan that N.I.A. was investigating.

30:22.502 --> 30:24.697
Nothing. Oh, excuse me.

30:24.771 --> 30:27.763
There was a 30-year-old
Japanese Zero.

30:27.841 --> 30:29.934
What Zero?

30:30.010 --> 30:32.604
A couple months ago, some kids were
skin-diving off one of the islands.

30:32.679 --> 30:36.115
They came across some old aircraft wreckage.
We were called in to investigate.

30:36.183 --> 30:40.176
It turned out to be a Zero shot down
during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

30:40.254 --> 30:44.850
Maybe Lieutenant Cook was in Tokyo to give
the Japanese the details. I don't know.

30:44.925 --> 30:48.088
He wasn't working on any drug cases?
Anything big?

30:48.161 --> 30:51.562
Captain Cooly wouldn't
give him anything big.

30:51.632 --> 30:55.762
Look, Healy, I don't wanna
ruin your career. I just...

30:55.836 --> 30:58.396
Look. If you won't give me
Dan's case files,

30:58.472 --> 31:00.736
will you at least call me
if you hear anything?

31:02.843 --> 31:05.243
Okay, Magnum.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.911
I just hope I don't end up
on the beach.

31:08.982 --> 31:10.916
See you, Magnum.

31:22.730 --> 31:25.221
I understand.

31:25.299 --> 31:27.233
Hmm.

31:31.638 --> 31:33.697
You're making a mess.
Look at that.

31:33.774 --> 31:35.708
What'd he say? Kill him.

31:35.776 --> 31:38.210
Okay. Is that better?

31:38.278 --> 31:41.042
Yeah. Come on.

32:32.433 --> 32:34.367
Hey, he's taking the freeway.

32:34.435 --> 32:37.268
Okay, okay, I'll catch
him at the next on-ramp.

33:05.132 --> 33:07.327
Despite what Ensign Healy said,

33:07.401 --> 33:12.395
Dan's death had to be connected
to some case he was investigating.

33:12.473 --> 33:15.033
It was the only thing
that made sense.

33:15.109 --> 33:18.670
Either that or he had been smuggling
coke, and that was impossible.

33:18.745 --> 33:20.679
I'd known Dan too long,

33:20.747 --> 33:23.181
put my life in his hands
too many times in 'Nam...

33:23.250 --> 33:26.651
not to know exactly
what he could and couldn't do.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.951
He could no more smuggle coke
than breathe underwater.

33:30.023 --> 33:32.253
No, the connection,

33:32.326 --> 33:37.320
the reason for his murder,
was somewhere in his case files.

33:37.397 --> 33:40.924
And if Healy wouldn't give
'em to me, I'd steal 'em.

33:49.743 --> 33:53.406
Alice's flight home with Dan's body
would be taking off about now.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.608
Part of me wished
I was with her.

33:56.683 --> 34:01.177
I didn't know what I could do to help.
Maybe just hold her hand.

34:22.309 --> 34:25.972
About the time my heart started again,
I realized whoever was on my tail,

34:26.045 --> 34:30.210
didn't have enough car to catch me, so I
started worrying about wrecking the Ferrari.

34:30.284 --> 34:32.650
I know it's crazy, but that's
what was going through my head.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.347
How could I pay for
a totaled 60,000 buck Ferrari?

34:38.292 --> 34:40.851
Then I quit worrying.

36:04.711 --> 36:07.236
It would take all night
to explain to 5-O...

36:07.314 --> 36:10.841
why a couple of yo-yos with a
machine gun tried to kill me.

36:10.917 --> 36:13.112
Especially since I didn't know.

36:13.186 --> 36:17.384
And since there was nothing I could do for
them, I decided to do the best thing for me...

36:17.457 --> 36:20.324
get the hell outta there.

36:20.394 --> 36:23.659
I don't want you to think
I was scared or anything.

36:23.730 --> 36:28.360
Of course, I didn't go over 35
the rest of the way home.

37:02.335 --> 37:05.202
After being nearly killed
on the Pali Highway,

37:05.272 --> 37:08.673
tangling with Zeus and Apollo
was gonna seem like child's play.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.240
At least they didn't have guns.

37:16.082 --> 37:19.518
Zeus? Apollo?

37:19.586 --> 37:21.520
Hi, guys.

37:23.056 --> 37:25.524
Zeus?

37:25.592 --> 37:27.526
Apollo?

37:31.398 --> 37:33.389
Zeus?

37:33.466 --> 37:36.162
Apollo? Hi, guys.

37:37.437 --> 37:41.271
Higgins, what are you doing?

37:41.341 --> 37:43.809
I thought we should have
a bit of a chat.

37:43.877 --> 37:47.870
Fine, but I need a drink. What would
you like? Beer? Whiskey? Bones?

37:47.948 --> 37:50.007
Easy, lads.

37:52.953 --> 37:56.150
Since you obviously intend to leech off
Robin Masters for the rest of your...

37:56.222 --> 37:58.486
Now you hold it!

37:58.558 --> 38:02.050
And that goes for you too.

38:02.128 --> 38:05.791
Look. Somebody just tried
to run me off the Pali.

38:05.865 --> 38:08.663
In Robin Masters's Ferrari?

38:08.735 --> 38:11.568
Forget it.
What do you want, Higgins?

38:12.672 --> 38:16.665
Mr. Masters called a while ago
to congratulate me.

38:16.743 --> 38:20.110
He received your cable saying
that I had passed the first test.

38:20.180 --> 38:23.445
That security here
was impenetrable.

38:23.516 --> 38:27.111
Well, I figured it is...
to anyone but me.

38:27.187 --> 38:29.121
Why'd you do it, Magnum?

38:30.457 --> 38:33.688
Hey, so you owe me one.

38:37.464 --> 38:41.161
Since you obviously intend to continue
living here on a permanent basis,

38:41.234 --> 38:43.668
we should set up
our territorial prerogatives.

38:43.737 --> 38:45.671
Our what?

38:45.739 --> 38:49.641
The main house, stables, tennis courts
and grounds will be my territory.

38:49.709 --> 38:52.371
You'll have the guesthouse
and the car.

38:52.445 --> 38:55.539
The tidal pool I think
we could consider a D.M.Z.

38:55.615 --> 38:57.845
You're serious. Quite.

38:57.917 --> 39:01.011
Well, what if I want to use
the stables or the tennis courts?

39:01.087 --> 39:05.285
I would expect to be informed of such
incursions prior to their occurrence.

39:05.358 --> 39:07.383
Agreed?

39:07.460 --> 39:09.394
Why not?

39:09.462 --> 39:13.091
Good. I'll have that drink now.
Whiskey, if you please.

39:15.702 --> 39:19.399
Don't ruin my whiskey with ice.
I'm not a bloody American.

39:21.474 --> 39:24.238
Sorry.

39:30.650 --> 39:33.619
To territorial prerogatives. First
drink's always to the regiment.

39:33.687 --> 39:36.417
To the Prince of Wales's
own West Yorkshire Regiment.

39:36.489 --> 39:38.423
The regiment.

39:42.062 --> 39:44.860
The lads and I
have guests to look after.

39:49.502 --> 39:52.266
It's a pity you couldn't have
been more like your sister.

39:59.913 --> 40:01.847
Come, lads.

40:20.633 --> 40:23.101
Rick's Place.

40:23.169 --> 40:25.103
It's Magnum.
Let me talk to Rick.

40:25.171 --> 40:27.139
Hang on.

40:31.544 --> 40:33.478
Okay, shoot. It's your nickel.

40:33.546 --> 40:37.607
Rick, I need a couple favors.
You name it, buddy.

40:37.684 --> 40:41.620
Two guys tried to run me
off the Pali Highway.

40:41.688 --> 40:45.784
They deep-sixed about a mile past Lani
Lookout. Can you make 'em for me?

40:45.859 --> 40:47.827
Are they dead?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

40:47.894 --> 40:49.828
Okay, no problem. Next.

40:49.896 --> 40:52.831
What's the word on Dan's death?
You're not gonna like it.

40:52.899 --> 40:54.867
Street says that
he was a lone wolf,

40:54.934 --> 40:57.630
muling for some dwarf dicer
who connected on a three slot.

40:57.704 --> 41:01.970
Rick, you don't speak English, I'm gonna
tell all of Honolulu your real name.

41:02.041 --> 41:04.271
Okay, okay.
Take it easy, will you?

41:04.344 --> 41:06.369
He was smuggling
for some small-time dealer...

41:06.446 --> 41:08.744
who made his sales
on a pay phone, okay?

41:08.815 --> 41:11.079
No, it's not okay.
Not Dan. He was one of us.

41:11.151 --> 41:14.746
Look, Magnum. 'Nam was a long time ago.
Guys change, you know.

41:14.821 --> 41:18.257
Rick, he was a pal.
He wasn't muling for anyone.

41:18.324 --> 41:20.383
He was iced
with 10 ounces of coke.

41:20.460 --> 41:23.327
Am I speaking your language?
Next.

41:23.396 --> 41:26.388
Set a meet with Snow White.
Snow White?

41:26.466 --> 41:29.663
What are you, nuts? Where do I get the Seven
Dwarfs to pull you out of the ocean, pal?

41:29.736 --> 41:32.933
You know anyone besides Snow White
who can waste 10 ounces of coke on a hit?

41:34.140 --> 41:37.439
No. All right, you win.
Midnight here.

41:37.510 --> 41:40.343
Great. Thanks, buddy.
I owe you one.

41:40.413 --> 41:43.314
Of all the cheap gin joints
in the world...

41:43.383 --> 41:46.409
Why did you have to go
and pick mine, sweetheart?

42:11.811 --> 42:15.178
- Find the soap?
- Oh.! Oh, Thomas.!

42:15.248 --> 42:18.149
Oh.!

42:23.857 --> 42:26.724
Think you're cute, don't you?
I don't know. Am I, sis?

42:26.793 --> 42:30.160
I just said that to get him
to let me in here.

42:30.230 --> 42:32.164
What'd you do
to that little man, anyway?

42:32.232 --> 42:35.360
That is not what we're going to discuss.
You were supposed to be on a plane.

42:35.435 --> 42:37.369
Okay, now look.
Before you say one word,

42:37.437 --> 42:39.496
I want you to listen to me,
okay, Thomas?

42:39.572 --> 42:42.405
Now we've known each other
since you and Dan were midshipmen.

42:42.475 --> 42:46.070
And you know that when I want something,
I go after it until I get it.

42:46.145 --> 42:50.775
And the only person on this island who wants
to find Dan's killer more than you is me.

42:50.850 --> 42:53.978
And since you're the only one who's doing
anything about it, I'm sticking with you.

42:54.053 --> 42:56.920
Now, I thought it over twice,
and that's it.

42:58.424 --> 43:00.688
Any questions?

43:00.760 --> 43:03.024
Yeah, one. Shoot.

43:08.768 --> 43:10.702
Who sleeps on the couch,

43:16.943 --> 43:19.411
sis?

43:19.479 --> 43:21.947
Oh, Thomas.

43:23.449 --> 43:25.508
What's this?

43:29.822 --> 43:31.949
Dan's dog tags.

43:32.025 --> 43:37.156
The navy gave me all of that. It's the
personal effects he had on him when he died.

43:43.603 --> 43:46.367
I'll let you get some clothes on.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.448
Yeah, I-I didn't find any
hotel receipts from Tokyo.

43:58.518 --> 44:00.952
He wasn't there that long.

44:01.020 --> 44:03.682
There was a receipt for some
photocopies he had done...

44:03.756 --> 44:07.453
at the Imperial War Records section
of the Japanese Navy.

44:07.527 --> 44:09.688
Do you think that could be important?
Well, it could prove...

44:09.762 --> 44:12.162
he was in Tokyo
on an N.I.A. investigation.

44:12.231 --> 44:15.860
Alice, where's the team ring?

44:17.003 --> 44:19.267
In the envelope.

44:41.160 --> 44:44.129
Water Bug Blue, Water Bug Blue,
this is Homeward Angel.

44:44.197 --> 44:46.131
You guys down there?

44:53.439 --> 44:56.135
Water Bug Blue, Water Bug Blue,
this is Homeward Angel.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.684
Water Bug Blue, Water Bug Blue,
this is Homeward Angel.

45:10.757 --> 45:12.691
Where have you been, mon ami?

45:12.759 --> 45:16.593
My alarm didn't go off. Hope you
didn't have any pressing engagements.

45:16.662 --> 45:19.324
No, nothing important.

45:19.399 --> 45:23.460
You sound 2,000 or 3,000 meters
south of us.

45:23.536 --> 45:25.834
Reloading!

45:28.207 --> 45:31.540
You're moving away! Reverse course!
Reverse course!

45:31.611 --> 45:34.102
Understood. Turning north.

45:35.448 --> 45:37.382
You sound hot.

45:38.418 --> 45:40.943
Oui. Charlie got us.

45:44.924 --> 45:47.449
You see 'em, Orville?

45:47.527 --> 45:51.019
Negative. We gotta hope
they're near that river.

45:51.097 --> 45:54.298
Water Bug Blue, Water Bug Blue, if you guys
wanna sleep on your own straw tonight,

45:54.300 --> 45:56.234
you better make
like the Fourth of July.

45:56.302 --> 45:59.430
There's a river wide enough for a pickup.
I'll guide you to her.

46:00.506 --> 46:02.974
There's a river.
He needs a flare!

46:08.181 --> 46:12.550
Gotcha! Gotcha. The river's 500
meters due west of your position.

46:12.618 --> 46:14.552
Due west.

46:29.569 --> 46:31.867
Get goin'. I'll cover.

46:47.086 --> 46:49.247
Did you find the ring?

46:54.060 --> 46:56.460
Are you all right, Tom?

47:01.477 --> 47:03.411
Fine.

47:20.224 --> 47:22.192
Hello. Hey, Moki.

47:22.260 --> 47:26.424
Magnum! Come on, brahda.
This Italian stallion your car?

47:26.497 --> 47:28.857
What do you mean is it mine?
Doesn't it look like it's mine?

47:28.900 --> 47:31.562
Come on, man.

47:44.348 --> 47:46.316
Welcome to the Snow Palace.

47:46.384 --> 47:48.318
Hey, I thought
the sign outside said "" Rick's"?

47:48.386 --> 47:53.380
Well, the tourists call it that, but to the
regulars who score coke, it is the Snow Palace.

48:03.568 --> 48:07.902
- Play it again, Sam.
- Oh, he didn't really say that.

48:07.972 --> 48:10.065
I'm afraid he did.
Rick, Alice Cook.

48:10.141 --> 48:12.769
Oh, Miss Cook, I'm so pleased to meet you,
and I'm sorry about your brother.

48:12.843 --> 48:15.539
He was such a good friend.
Thank you.

48:15.613 --> 48:19.606
Listen, I got a make on that muscle that
tried to wipe you out on the Pali Highway.

48:19.684 --> 48:22.676
- Somebody tried to kill you?
- No.

48:22.753 --> 48:25.449
You know how it is when you drive a
Ferrari? People always wanna race you.

48:25.523 --> 48:28.720
These guys, they just drove it over the edge.
At least, that's how the cops figured it.

48:28.793 --> 48:31.921
Mm-hmm. And what was
the name of this racer?

48:31.996 --> 48:34.521
- Kioki.
- Kioki.

48:34.599 --> 48:37.796
- Kioki.
- Ever work for Snow White?

48:37.868 --> 48:42.032
Yeah, he was freelance.
He worked for a lot of people.

48:42.106 --> 48:44.631
Hey, Thomas, I like her.
She's got it upstairs.

48:44.709 --> 48:47.143
Next to you,
everybody's got it upstairs.

48:48.479 --> 48:52.882
You're probably wondering why Rick didn't give me
the name of the other guy killed in the crash.

48:52.950 --> 48:55.441
Well, he's not stupid.
He didn't want to upset Alice.

48:55.519 --> 48:58.215
I know.
I don't believe that either.

48:58.289 --> 49:01.281
- The meeting set? - I can't
let you go through with it.

49:01.359 --> 49:03.657
Oh, yeah? I can't.

49:03.728 --> 49:06.219
Hey, Sam? Your name really Sam?

49:06.297 --> 49:10.165
- Hell, no. It's Albert. - Well, that's kind
of funny because his name isn't Rick either...

49:10.234 --> 49:13.567
Very funny. Very funny.
Will you wait for me in the office?

49:13.638 --> 49:16.402
Go on. Hit it.
Go in the office. Miss Cook.

49:26.017 --> 49:30.010
Hey, your name ain't Rick? just spin
'em, Sam. just keep on spinning 'em.

49:30.087 --> 49:32.282
It ain't Rick?

49:35.292 --> 49:39.456
Oh, my God.

49:39.530 --> 49:42.363
I don't believe this place.
It's amazing.

49:42.433 --> 49:45.596
Yeah, isn't it? Oh!

49:45.670 --> 49:48.764
Hey, I didn't see
these windows from out there.

49:48.839 --> 49:53.037
It's a one-way mirror. We can
see out, but they can't see in.

49:53.110 --> 49:56.443
Oh. Hey, is Snow White out there?

49:56.514 --> 49:58.448
She's out there.

49:58.516 --> 50:02.008
Where is she? Right there.

50:03.888 --> 50:06.379
Well, she-she's just a child.

50:06.457 --> 50:10.291
That child controls all the coke
dealt between here and Hong Kong.

50:10.361 --> 50:13.353
Oh, but Thomas, she can't be
more than... what... 20.

50:13.431 --> 50:15.365
Nineteen.

50:15.433 --> 50:18.266
Six of those years were under
the tutelage of General Nu Trang.

50:18.335 --> 50:21.827
He was military commander
of Van Dong Province during the war.

50:21.906 --> 50:27.344
That gave him control of all the drugs moving in
the Golden Triangle between Cambodia and Vietnam.

50:27.411 --> 50:29.345
Her father taught her.
Her husband.

50:29.413 --> 50:33.577
She was married at 13?

50:33.651 --> 50:37.883
Eleven. He was killed two years ago in
Singapore. Scuttlebutt has it she did it.

50:41.158 --> 50:44.821
- She's staring at us.
- Not through a one-way mirror she isn't.

50:48.566 --> 50:50.193
Don't bet on it.

51:09.286 --> 51:12.949
How do you know
this navy officer was murdered?

51:13.023 --> 51:16.015
He was a friend.
He wouldn't smuggle cocaine.

51:16.093 --> 51:20.427
He was my brother.
He was not a smuggler.

51:20.498 --> 51:23.490
In any case, why come to me?

51:23.567 --> 51:28.732
You and your people are the only ones on the Islands
with enough coke to burn 10 ounces on a murder.

51:28.806 --> 51:32.970
Just because one has an oasis in the
desert, doesn't mean one drowns people.

51:33.043 --> 51:34.977
Why don't you write that
in the john?

51:35.045 --> 51:38.071
If your friend was murdered,

51:38.149 --> 51:42.643
finding his killer may be of,
uh, mutual benefit.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.883
How? Madame Nu Trang and I are,

51:45.956 --> 51:48.948
uh, shall we say,
loosely affiliated.

51:49.026 --> 51:51.517
Same profession,
different product.

51:51.595 --> 51:55.588
What do you smuggle?
I deal... in gold.

51:58.669 --> 52:00.830
About a month ago,
it was rumored in Hong Kong...

52:00.905 --> 52:04.102
that, uh,
$30 million of gold bullion...

52:04.175 --> 52:07.975
was about to change hands in Hawaii...
at half that price.

52:08.045 --> 52:11.014
Who would sell gold
at half its value?

52:11.081 --> 52:13.811
Someone who doesn't legally own it.
Precisely.

52:13.884 --> 52:17.183
Who? If I knew that, I
would be buying it myself.

52:17.254 --> 52:20.189
What does this have to do
with Dan's death?

52:20.257 --> 52:23.749
If Dan got wind of this gold deal
through one of his investigations,

52:23.828 --> 52:27.161
- and the people who were involved
found out... - They would kill him.

52:27.231 --> 52:29.893
In a manner that would
mislead his associates...

52:29.967 --> 52:33.459
so that others would not
connect his death to his work.

52:33.537 --> 52:35.767
It's like La Bull. Mm.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.809
La Bull?
I don't know his real name.

52:38.876 --> 52:41.868
In fact, I've never met him.

52:41.946 --> 52:45.939
He appeared a few years ago
in the heroin trade.

52:46.016 --> 52:49.008
Became a major force overnight.

52:49.086 --> 52:52.078
Some say
he has Chinese connections.

52:52.156 --> 52:57.150
From heroin, he's expanded
into guns, diamonds,

52:58.796 --> 53:00.388
gold.

53:00.464 --> 53:04.059
He's in your Islands, your territory,
and you haven't stopped him?

53:04.134 --> 53:07.069
He's not here to compete
in my specialty.

53:07.137 --> 53:09.230
But if I nail him
for killing my friend...

53:09.306 --> 53:12.400
That would be karma.

53:12.476 --> 53:17.539
- And you would get the gold.
- And you your brother's killer.

53:22.887 --> 53:26.880
If this La Bull murdered Dan,

53:26.957 --> 53:30.120
you don't have to worry about him
leaving the Islands with any gold.

53:30.194 --> 53:33.493
You have my word on that.
Now where is he?

53:48.679 --> 53:51.944
Kahoolawe? Ain't nothing
on that rock, man.

53:52.016 --> 53:56.009
- That's a naval gunnery range.
- She didn't say...

53:56.086 --> 54:00.420
She didn't say he was on the island. She said
he was cruising somewhere in the vicinity.

54:02.259 --> 54:04.420
Where'd you steal
that camera, boy?

54:04.495 --> 54:06.656
I didn't steal it.
I got it surplus.

54:06.730 --> 54:10.291
Uh-huh. I did.

54:11.702 --> 54:15.695
Hey, man. Are those girls naked? - T.C.,
will you concentrate on the mission?

54:32.523 --> 54:36.254
It's now or never. Come on!
Let's get out of here!

54:45.536 --> 54:47.629
Here they come.
Man, here they come.

55:09.493 --> 55:14.396
Pepe's dead! Dan?

55:14.465 --> 55:17.593
I can make it. I can make it.
Take him. I'll cover.

55:17.668 --> 55:19.898
Don't wait too long.

56:08.619 --> 56:12.783
Come on, man.
You're coming, do it now!

56:12.856 --> 56:16.223
It's too late. I'm hit.

56:17.728 --> 56:20.720
- Phillipe, come on!
- I'll never make it. Go!

56:20.798 --> 56:22.322
No!

56:26.437 --> 56:29.429
Phillipe, no!

56:45.589 --> 56:48.752
Kahoolawe dead ahead.

56:59.603 --> 57:02.595
All right, big fella,
I got us here. Now what?

57:02.673 --> 57:06.666
We find La Bull. Just like that?

57:06.743 --> 57:09.906
I mean, you don't know what the boy look
like. You don't know what ship he's on.

57:09.980 --> 57:13.882
All you know is that Goldilocks said he's
somewhere in the vicinity of Kahoolawe.

57:13.951 --> 57:16.943
It's Snow White, not Goldilocks.

57:17.020 --> 57:20.615
And I'll know La Bull's
ship when I see it. How?

57:20.691 --> 57:22.522
I'll just know, that's all.

57:22.693 --> 57:26.561
Maybe we'll catch him
buying the gold.

57:26.630 --> 57:30.794
Now, look, we got a dozen yachts to check
to the south towards the Big Island.

57:30.868 --> 57:35.771
We got another six or seven in the Maui Channel
and two more off the windward side of Kahoolawe.

57:35.839 --> 57:37.830
Hey, how about the one dead ahead?

57:37.908 --> 57:42.811
That's a navy patrol boat to keep the people off
Kahoolawe when they're using it for gunnery practice.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.542
I don't think we'll find
La Bull in the U.S. Navy.

57:45.616 --> 57:47.743
T.C., I wish you'd get
in the spirit of this case.

57:47.818 --> 57:50.309
Ah, you almost said mission again.

57:50.387 --> 57:53.254
To the south, T.C.
We'll start to the south.

57:53.323 --> 57:56.759
Mm-hmm, long live the south.

58:58.222 --> 59:01.623
I think I'm in love. Did you see
the bazooms on that woman?

59:01.692 --> 59:04.684
It's Sunday. It's a sin to
look at bazooms on Sunday?

59:04.761 --> 59:08.253
The navy doesn't hold gunnery practice
on Sunday... not in peacetime.

59:08.332 --> 59:11.995
Oh, Andy. Well, maybe they done declared
war and done forgot to tell you and me.

59:12.069 --> 59:15.937
And maybe that's not a navy
patrol boat... Off Kahoolawe.

59:29.286 --> 59:32.084
You know, Thomas, if that is navy,
they ain't gonna like this.

59:32.155 --> 59:34.646
I mean, they gonna take my number
and fine my behind.

59:34.725 --> 59:37.216
If that's a navy patrol boat,
I'll pay the fine.

59:39.196 --> 59:41.687
What? You pay the fine?

59:41.765 --> 59:44.097
Just sneak around the island,
will ya, T.C.? Sneak?

59:44.167 --> 59:45.725
Sneak. Okay, we're
officially sneaking.

01:00:04.788 --> 01:00:06.653
Helicopter, sir.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.291
Yeah! She's private.
No markings. No guns.

01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:16.958
But her lines would fool anybody from
a distance. That's gotta be La Bull.

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:19.914
I'll bet a month's pay he's rendezvousing
with whoever's selling the gold.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.133
- Hey, that crew looked Vietnamese.
- Yeah, just like old times.

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:25.140
One more pass.
Come at 'em from over the island.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:29.907
You know, we surprised 'em the first time,
Thomas. Now they might throw rocks.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.811
Where are they gonna get rocks?

01:00:51.068 --> 01:00:53.434
Hey, they're waving us off.
Keep going.

01:00:58.775 --> 01:01:04.111
Man, I got that old feeling.
They're not gonna shoot at us.

01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:12.553
- They're shooting at you.
- No, they're not.

01:01:12.622 --> 01:01:17.525
- Yes, they are. Soviet Kalashnikov
AK-47 assault rifles. - Higgins.

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:20.154
Seven-point-six millimeters. Six
hundred rounds per minute. Higgins.

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:23.199
Effective killing range of 300 meters.
Higgins.

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:27.600
I personally prefer the British Sterling,
but the Kalashnikov is a fine weapon.

01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:32.472
This isn't your usual adultery or divorce
case... is it, Magnum? just develop the photos.

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:36.706
Don't push, Magnum. I'm only doing this
because, as you put it, I owe you one.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.943
You don't take cases like that,
do you, Tom?

01:01:40.016 --> 01:01:43.508
I mean, following someone's husband
or wife just to catch them with a lover.

01:01:43.587 --> 01:01:47.250
What about the blowup
of the guy in the khakis?

01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:51.317
It's developing now, but, quite frankly, it's
a bloody mess. You were quite out of focus.

01:01:51.395 --> 01:01:54.091
Do you take pictures of them? Hmph.
Not good ones, I'll wager.

01:01:54.164 --> 01:01:58.396
- I was in a helicopter. - Oh, I thought
you were flapping your bloody arms.

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:02.063
Of course, you do have to
make a living.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:06.303
Not all my cases are like that, Alice.
Oh, no. I'm sure they're not.

01:02:06.376 --> 01:02:09.868
Once in a while, one comes along.
I am a private investigator.

01:02:09.946 --> 01:02:13.506
I mean, a lawyer doesn't turn down a divorce
case just 'cause it might get sticky, does he?

01:02:13.517 --> 01:02:15.678
Of course not.
Well, neither do I.

01:02:15.752 --> 01:02:17.686
There.

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.684
Higgins, this is awful. I told you
it was too out of focus to enlarge.

01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:28.595
I wouldn't know that man if he were
my own father. Your own father?

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:31.463
Oh, Tom's my stepbrother.

01:02:31.535 --> 01:02:35.062
Oh, that explains it.

01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:38.733
The way he stands. His build.

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:41.141
Something familiar about him.

01:02:51.421 --> 01:02:53.355
Zeus. Apollo.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.360
Yes, sir, Mr. Masters.

01:02:59.429 --> 01:03:01.761
Yeah, baby,
let me talk to Thomas Magnum.

01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:03.993
Magnum!

01:03:05.735 --> 01:03:11.264
This is a private phone. Not for your personal
use. It won't happen again. I promise.

01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:16.335
Magnum here. Well, here's to surviving
another... What did you call it?

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:19.007
Case. T.C., are they still
anchored off Kahoolawe?

01:03:19.082 --> 01:03:22.848
You know, Thomas, it sure is pouring
down rain on this side of the island.

01:03:22.919 --> 01:03:25.911
Uh, T.C.
It's also pouring down rain...

01:03:25.989 --> 01:03:28.321
between here and Kahoolawe.
T.C.?

01:03:28.391 --> 01:03:32.589
- It's also very dark between here
and Kahoolawe. - You want something?

01:03:32.662 --> 01:03:34.425
Gas money, baby. Just gas money.

01:03:34.498 --> 01:03:37.331
Look, T.C., I told you
I would make it up to you.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.565
Why do I even bother asking? Okay, by the time
I got back, they had raised anchor and run.

01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:45.506
But I spotted them
headed south toward the Big Island.

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:49.011
About dark, they rendezvoused
with a speedboat.

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.013
To pick up the gold? Too quick.

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:53.948
Somebody jumped in the speedboat,
and they all headed toward Maui.

01:03:54.017 --> 01:03:56.850
That's La Bull. Probably,
if he was aboard.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.514
Oh, you can bet on it. I got a
shot of him on that last pass.

01:03:59.589 --> 01:04:03.889
Well, that's only fair considering
he got a couple of shots at us.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.521
I will have Higgins take a copy of this
over to Rick's.

01:04:07.597 --> 01:04:09.724
Why don't you stop by,
take a look, see if you know him, okay?

01:04:09.799 --> 01:04:13.895
Yeah, yeah. Sure. I ain't seen Orville
in a couple of weeks anyway.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.530
Hey, Thomas, you sure you don't want
to let the Coast Guard in on this?

01:04:16.606 --> 01:04:19.439
No, I gotta do it my way.
Mm-hmm.

01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:24.537
- No.
- Aw, Higgins.

01:04:24.614 --> 01:04:27.640
I just want you to run a copy
of this photo over to Rick's.

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:32.654
Out of the question.
I've got my lads to feed.

01:04:34.157 --> 01:04:36.990
Poor things are probably starved.
Higgins.

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.893
Higgins!

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:42.557
Higgins.!

01:04:42.632 --> 01:04:46.500
- Higgins!
- Thomas.

01:04:47.837 --> 01:04:51.534
Zeus. Apollo. Come on.
Come here this instant.

01:05:03.353 --> 01:05:08.188
Higgins, I'd take the photo to
Rick's, but Alice and I... The car.

01:05:08.258 --> 01:05:11.557
- The car?
- I want it back.

01:05:11.628 --> 01:05:15.758
- I don't want you driving it.
- Now, wait a minute. I...

01:05:15.832 --> 01:05:17.891
It's a deal. It's a deal.

01:05:17.968 --> 01:05:23.235
- No. - Look, you said we needed my
brother's car to get into Pearl anyway.

01:05:23.306 --> 01:05:28.801
- Your brother?
- Oh, it's my mother's third husband.

01:05:28.878 --> 01:05:33.872
- No relation to Tom.
- Fascinating.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:36.282
Well, Magnum?

01:05:38.054 --> 01:05:39.885
Is it a deal?

01:05:43.727 --> 01:05:46.059
It's a deal.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.333
God, you were all so young.

01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:03.743
What'd you say? Nothing.

01:06:03.813 --> 01:06:08.648
Oh, well, now, that's the Thomas
I fell in love with... as a schoolgirl.

01:06:09.919 --> 01:06:13.082
You think you can fool 'em? Why not?
I did it for 10 years.

01:06:13.156 --> 01:06:17.650
Oh, no, you didn't. You were good.
Dan said maybe the best.

01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:19.922
Look, don't let
the uniform fool you, Alice.

01:06:19.996 --> 01:06:23.022
I'm not the same man I was then.

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:27.092
Why'd you quit, Tom?
It was nothing earth-shattering.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:31.504
One day I woke up age 33
and realized I'd never been 23.

01:06:32.842 --> 01:06:35.072
That's it? That's it.

01:06:35.145 --> 01:06:38.308
I resigned, Alice.
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:44.080
Didn't mean to pry.

01:06:48.758 --> 01:06:53.923
I'm sorry, Alice.
I'm just wound up.

01:06:53.997 --> 01:06:58.161
I-I swore I'd never wear
a uniform again, even on Halloween.

01:07:01.171 --> 01:07:03.662
That's too bad.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.073
Because you look
very handsome in uniform.

01:07:17.554 --> 01:07:20.079
This is no good, Alice.

01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:22.647
Why not?

01:07:22.726 --> 01:07:25.388
Because...

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:30.229
Look, I always knew that someday
if the timing was right, that we'd be...

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.734
We'd be lovers.

01:07:32.802 --> 01:07:36.294
But this timing is lousy.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:41.641
You're still in shock
over Dan's death.

01:07:41.711 --> 01:07:45.238
Hell, the other day at the airport, you were
acting as if it hadn't happened. You're confused.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:48.307
You're hurt. You're... scared.

01:07:48.384 --> 01:07:53.720
You're very vulnerable.
I'm not gonna take advantage of that.

01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:57.021
Who are you trying to convince?
Me or you?

01:07:57.093 --> 01:08:02.429
Yeah, sure I'm-I'm scared
and I'm confused.

01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:04.990
And maybe I'm even vulnerable.

01:08:05.068 --> 01:08:09.095
But, in all the years I've known you, Tom,
I've never asked you to be my big brother.

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:14.401
Haven't you, sis?

01:08:17.613 --> 01:08:23.051
Oh, you're right about one thing.
The timing is really lousy.

01:10:11.662 --> 01:10:14.995
Oh, no, it's Ski.

01:10:25.342 --> 01:10:28.004
That was close.

01:10:29.113 --> 01:10:31.445
Oh, that's all I need.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.814
What if one of the guards
at the N.I.A. knows you?

01:10:35.886 --> 01:10:39.720
Junior people catch Sunday night watch.
Chances are there's no one on duty I know.

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:44.625
And what if there is? I thought you
could entice them away from the desk.

01:10:44.695 --> 01:10:46.856
Entice?

01:10:49.099 --> 01:10:51.431
Entice.

01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:08.646
Okay, the duty officer and the
guard will be in the main entry.

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:12.917
If I don't know 'em, I'm gonna go straight
in. You just sit tight. It may be a while.

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:14.924
What if someone comes by
and asks me what I'm doing here?

01:11:14.992 --> 01:11:19.486
Uh, you tell 'em that you're here
to pick up your brother's personal gear.

01:11:19.563 --> 01:11:23.363
That, um, Ensign Healy,
Captain Cooly's aide brought you.

01:11:40.217 --> 01:11:43.778
- Take care, Thomas.
- You too.

01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:18.318
You always read on duty, seaman?
N-No, sir.

01:12:18.388 --> 01:12:23.223
I mean, yes, sir. I mean, well,
sometimes, sir. Sometimes.

01:12:23.293 --> 01:12:25.227
I've never seen you before.
What's your name?

01:12:25.295 --> 01:12:28.230
Seaman Wolfe, sir. I just reported
from Great Lakes on Wednesday.

01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:31.392
Do you know the temperature today
in Honolulu, Seaman Wolfe?

01:12:31.468 --> 01:12:35.734
No, sir. I mean, well, maybe, sir.

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:37.740
Uh, 72, sir?

01:12:37.808 --> 01:12:42.802
Do you know the temperature today at
Great Lakes, Seaman Wolfe? No, sir.

01:12:42.879 --> 01:12:47.407
Well, neither do I, but I bet you it's cold enough to
raise goose bumps on your butt just thinking about it.

01:12:47.484 --> 01:12:50.817
Yes, sir. Well, unless goose
bumps give you a thrill,

01:12:50.887 --> 01:12:54.880
I suggest you save cheap
Robin Masters novels for off-duty time.

01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:58.291
Yes, sir.
Where's the duty officer?

01:12:58.362 --> 01:13:02.526
Uh, went to get some chow, sir.
He'll be back shortly, sir.

01:13:02.599 --> 01:13:04.760
Who's the duty officer tonight,
Seaman Wolfe?

01:13:04.835 --> 01:13:07.998
Uh, Ensign Healy, sir.

01:13:20.017 --> 01:13:22.178
We all make mistakes.

01:13:22.252 --> 01:13:25.483
Not figuring Ensign Healy to have
the duty was a big one.

01:13:25.555 --> 01:13:29.218
But, I'd be in and out here
before he ever got back.

01:13:29.293 --> 01:13:32.785
I know. I don't believe that either.

01:14:06.596 --> 01:14:10.999
Healy was right.
Captain Cooly had assigned Dan the dregs.

01:14:11.068 --> 01:14:16.404
Everything from petty vandalism in base housing
to finding Admiral Matheson's missing dog.

01:14:16.473 --> 01:14:20.637
Putting Dan on this stuff was like making
McGarrett the meter maid on Waikiki.

01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:24.044
But one of these routine cases
had somehow gotten Dan killed.

01:14:24.114 --> 01:14:27.948
I'd know which one when I saw it.
Don't ask me how. I just knew I would.

01:14:52.576 --> 01:14:56.569
Excuse me, but isn't this
Lieutenant Daniel Cook's MG?

01:14:56.646 --> 01:15:00.639
I'm his sister.
Oh, well, I'm very sorry, Miss Cook.

01:15:00.717 --> 01:15:03.517
Your brother was a fine officer and a
gentleman. He'll be sorely missed.

01:15:04.554 --> 01:15:08.217
I appreciate that.
Aren't you getting wet?

01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:11.385
Yes, I think I am.

01:15:15.749 --> 01:15:20.812
Uh, Miss Cook, uh, may I ask you what
you're doing here at 2:00 in the morning?

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.573
Waiting for Ensign Healy.

01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:33.143
Fate didn't let me down.
Halfway through the files, I found it.

01:15:33.216 --> 01:15:35.446
A letter from the mother
of a navy pilot...

01:15:35.519 --> 01:15:39.182
declared missing in action
on December 7, 1941.

01:15:39.256 --> 01:15:43.090
Her son had been flying secret cargo
from Manila to Hickam.

01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:46.822
Unfortunately, his E. T.A. in Hawaii
was the same as the attacking Japanese.

01:15:46.897 --> 01:15:50.958
He was presumably shot down by Zeroes.
His plane was never found.

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:58.874
She'd read that skin divers had recently discovered
aircraft wreckage dating back to World War II.

01:15:58.942 --> 01:16:00.876
Could it have been her son's plane?

01:16:00.944 --> 01:16:04.846
She included a clipping from the paper
dated a few months ago.

01:16:04.915 --> 01:16:10.251
It showed the wreck had been found
off of... you guessed it... Kahoolawe.

01:16:11.288 --> 01:16:16.749
Dan wrote her a nice letter saying he'd check it
out with the officer investigating the wreckage.

01:16:16.826 --> 01:16:19.317
Captain J. Cooly.

01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:28.695
How did you know I had the duty?
Captain Cooly told me.

01:16:28.772 --> 01:16:32.606
Well, I wish you would've called me. See, I can't
let you take anything until he approves it.

01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:37.340
Oh, well, the admiral only wants his
personal photographs and mementos.

01:16:37.414 --> 01:16:41.407
- The admiral... your father?
- Yes, that's right.

01:16:41.484 --> 01:16:45.580
- You are the duty officer, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:16:45.655 --> 01:16:49.819
Well, then, don't you have the same approval
as the commanding officer when he's not here?

01:16:49.893 --> 01:16:52.259
I mean, that's what
my daddy always told me.

01:16:52.329 --> 01:16:54.889
Technically, yes, I guess I do.

01:16:54.965 --> 01:16:56.933
Well, good, then it's all settled.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.366
Yeah.

01:17:01.871 --> 01:17:06.137
I didn't have all the facts, but I had
enough to figure that La Bull killed Dan.

01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:09.872
And Cooly was tied to La Bull.

01:17:09.946 --> 01:17:14.383
Dan's case file would get me Cooly.
And Cooly would get me La Bull.

01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:17.876
It was my own domino theory.

01:17:21.124 --> 01:17:25.083
There we go, seaman
and, uh, save me some thighs, huh?

01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:28.153
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, this way, Miss Cook.

01:17:28.231 --> 01:17:30.165
Thank you.

01:17:51.655 --> 01:17:55.147
Don't look at the elevator.
Work the lock.

01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:57.159
Work the lock.
Don't look at the elevator.

01:17:57.327 --> 01:18:00.421
You looked at the elevator.

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:07.764
Uh, your brother's office is there.
Right down this way. Let's go.

01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:17.440
Now, if you'll just tell me which items you wanna
take, I'll make a list and you can sign for them.

01:18:17.514 --> 01:18:21.006
How's that sound?
That's just fine.

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:28.418
The second I entered Cooly's office,

01:18:28.491 --> 01:18:31.324
my nose told me my domino theory
wouldn't work.

01:18:45.175 --> 01:18:48.338
From the smell, I'd guess he died
sometime late Friday.

01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:51.903
From the expression,
in a lot of pain.

01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:56.315
I didn't feel sorry for him,
but I did wish he were still alive.

01:18:56.386 --> 01:18:58.547
Alive, he could've led me to La Bull.

01:18:58.621 --> 01:19:03.024
Dead, all he could do
was turn my stomach.

01:19:14.304 --> 01:19:17.501
"Received this date by Miss Alice Cook,
sister of the deceased. '."

01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:20.202
That oughta do it.

01:19:23.613 --> 01:19:26.605
Now if you'll just sign this, Miss Cook,
we'll be finished.

01:19:26.683 --> 01:19:28.617
Okay.

01:19:30.787 --> 01:19:33.449
There you go. Thank you.

01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:36.982
Okay. Let's go.

01:19:39.596 --> 01:19:43.692
Keep your nose out of those pulps when
you're on watch, son. You'll do fine.

01:19:43.767 --> 01:19:46.099
Good night, sir.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.395
Oh. No, no, no.

01:20:19.469 --> 01:20:22.461
No, you've got wet enough
for one night.

01:20:22.539 --> 01:20:24.871
And thanks again, Ensign.

01:20:24.941 --> 01:20:29.105
The admiral will be most grateful.
The pleasure was mine.

01:20:33.082 --> 01:20:37.712
Oh, send my regards to the admiral.
I will.

01:20:45.261 --> 01:20:47.229
You scared the life out of me up there.

01:20:47.297 --> 01:20:51.757
Kind of had the same thing happen to me.
Let's get out of here, Alice.

01:21:07.183 --> 01:21:11.279
Well? I found out
why Dan was killed.

01:21:11.354 --> 01:21:13.754
Why? Six months ago some
kids skin diving...

01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:16.815
where they shouldn't off Kahoolawe,
they found some wreckage.

01:21:16.893 --> 01:21:19.555
Captain Cooly
was called in to investigate.

01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:25.295
Now, he reported that it was an old Japanese Zero
shot down during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

01:21:25.368 --> 01:21:28.860
Well, so then, Dan... Dan was
sent to Tokyo on official business.

01:21:28.938 --> 01:21:31.930
Not really.
Tom, I don't understand.

01:21:32.008 --> 01:21:35.603
Well, Dan got this letter from
the mother of a navy pilot...

01:21:35.678 --> 01:21:39.512
who was reported missing in action
on December 7, 1941.

01:21:39.582 --> 01:21:44.076
Now, she read about the skin divers finding the
wreckage and wondered if it might be her son's plane.

01:21:44.153 --> 01:21:48.556
See, he was carrying a secret cargo from the
Philippines to Hawaii. Guess what it was?

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:52.288
Gold. Yeah. Government gold.

01:21:52.362 --> 01:21:56.059
Only Cooly didn't tell it that way.
Cooly said the wreckage was a Zero.

01:21:56.132 --> 01:22:00.796
Nothing to salvage, covered with coral inside a naval
gunnery range... who was to know the difference?

01:22:03.439 --> 01:22:05.100
Dan. Yeah, Dan.

01:22:05.174 --> 01:22:09.167
Now, he must've gone to Japan
to check the Japanese war records,

01:22:09.245 --> 01:22:12.510
and of course, nothing would match
what Cooly was saying.

01:22:14.183 --> 01:22:17.675
Anyway, it got him killed.

01:22:17.754 --> 01:22:20.518
And if Cooly didn't do it,
he knew it was gonna be done.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:30.422
That bastard!
I'll kill him, Thomas!

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:34.163
I swear it. I'll kill him myself!
I will! I will!

01:22:34.237 --> 01:22:36.569
Alice, somebody already did.

01:22:39.742 --> 01:22:42.905
You killed him? No. He'd been
dead for a couple of days.

01:22:42.979 --> 01:22:46.142
La Bull killed him.

01:22:46.215 --> 01:22:48.376
Or one of his boys.

01:23:02.532 --> 01:23:05.524
I've wasted over an hour on this.
Is there any reply?

01:23:06.836 --> 01:23:11.830
I don't think I know him.
Of course, it's hard to tell from this.

01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:15.742
I didn't take that photograph.
I merely printed and delivered it.

01:23:15.812 --> 01:23:19.304
Now, if you, uh, gentlemen will excuse
me, I'll be returning to Robin's Nest.

01:23:19.382 --> 01:23:23.409
Hey, Higgins, here's a little
something for your trouble.

01:23:25.288 --> 01:23:29.486
- I don't accept tips.
- Yeah, I bet you don't give 'em either.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.830
Mm-mm-mm,
I do love window shopping here.

01:23:39.902 --> 01:23:43.838
You know, I think I'll take that little mama right
over there in them black, sprayed-on pants.

01:23:43.906 --> 01:23:47.637
Or-Or that one in that spangled dress. Do
you see over there, Rick, by the piano?

01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:50.304
No, no. Maybe I'd better take
that one in that orange dress.!

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.679
- Whoo-hoo.! She really looks good.
- Victor Charlie!

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:57.652
Where? That Hawaiian King
Kong trailing Higgins.

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.711
He's a hit man.

01:24:05.061 --> 01:24:07.052
Moki!

01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:11.294
Moki, big, busted-up Hawaiian following
a sourpussed haole. Did you see him?

01:24:11.367 --> 01:24:13.358
No, I didn't see anybody.

01:24:45.235 --> 01:24:47.669
Brahda.

01:24:47.737 --> 01:24:50.729
I beg your pardon.
I'm not your brother.

01:24:50.807 --> 01:24:53.469
You're gonna wish you were.

01:24:53.543 --> 01:24:56.535
Sorry, I should've warned you. I was a
commando instructor during the war.

01:24:56.613 --> 01:24:58.604
Oh, that's all right.
It didn't hurt much.

01:24:58.681 --> 01:25:02.742
What are you doing with Magnum's car?
Magnum's car?

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:05.617
Mm-hmm. This is the
property of Robin Masters,

01:25:05.688 --> 01:25:07.622
and I happen to be
in his employ.

01:25:15.765 --> 01:25:17.699
Rick!

01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:21.800
What is this? What'd you do, re-up?
What's going on?

01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:30.508
Higgins!

01:25:43.326 --> 01:25:46.989
I, uh, don't know what to say.

01:25:47.063 --> 01:25:49.293
So, you owe me one.

01:25:49.365 --> 01:25:52.232
I'd really rather not.

01:25:54.137 --> 01:25:56.469
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:26:05.782 --> 01:26:08.945
I always knew you could shoot,
but where'd you get this gun, Orville?

01:26:10.286 --> 01:26:12.220
Orville?

01:26:14.724 --> 01:26:17.716
Is it him? No. It's not La Bull.

01:26:22.098 --> 01:26:25.590
Maybe I should've told her
it was La Bull. That it was over.

01:26:27.103 --> 01:26:31.096
But I couldn't lie to Alice about that
any more than I could lie to myself.

01:26:31.174 --> 01:26:36.009
I'd know La Bull when I saw him. Call it
fate, premonition, whatever you want.

01:26:36.079 --> 01:26:40.573
This wouldn't end until he and I met
face-to-face, and we both knew it.

01:26:41.818 --> 01:26:45.310
He figured to be on the run,
back to Asia, if Snow White was right.

01:26:45.388 --> 01:26:47.015
And that meant
a flight out of Honolulu.

01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:49.854
By dawn, the police had sent copies
of the blowup to all the airlines.

01:26:49.926 --> 01:26:53.760
But it was so blurred, it would take
a miracle to recognize him.

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:57.493
Still, I felt I knew him.

01:26:58.968 --> 01:27:01.300
Maybe Dan did too.

01:27:22.926 --> 01:27:26.589
- What is it?
- I know who La Bull is.

01:27:26.663 --> 01:27:28.631
Who?

01:27:29.699 --> 01:27:33.692
I'd missed the first flight to Hong Kong
that morning,

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:36.261
but I knew La Bull wasn't on it.

01:27:36.339 --> 01:27:39.331
Don't ask me how.
I just knew it.

01:27:39.409 --> 01:27:44.574
He was here. Close.
I could feel him.

01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:55.080
All standby passengers
for Hong Kong Flight 211...

01:27:55.158 --> 01:27:57.490
please report to Gate 5.

01:27:58.628 --> 01:28:02.428
All standby passengers
for Hong Kong Flight 211,

01:28:02.498 --> 01:28:04.830
please report to Gate 5.

01:28:18.281 --> 01:28:19.873
Magnum!

01:28:21.651 --> 01:28:26.145
- We never got to say good-bye.
- Or go swimming together.

01:28:39.769 --> 01:28:44.797
Global Airlines Flight 81
from Manilla, now arriving at Gate 15.

01:28:46.809 --> 01:28:50.142
Global Airlines Flight 81
from Manilla,

01:28:50.213 --> 01:28:52.773
now arriving at Gate 15.

01:29:04.794 --> 01:29:09.458
As you can see, I survived. So did Dan.
Until last week.

01:29:11.801 --> 01:29:15.669
I didn't know it was him
until it was too late.

01:29:17.373 --> 01:29:19.364
And me?

01:29:23.212 --> 01:29:26.204
There are two kinds of men
in a war, Magnum.

01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:32.454
Those who can end life
and those who can't.

01:29:32.522 --> 01:29:36.822
- But, of course you know that.
- This isn't 'Nam.

01:29:39.495 --> 01:29:41.429
No.

01:29:44.333 --> 01:29:46.267
Why didn't you come back for me?

01:30:29.112 --> 01:30:33.173
We came back, Phillipe,
but you were gone.

01:31:22.698 --> 01:31:25.496
The day after I rolled out of
intensive care,

01:31:25.568 --> 01:31:31.529
Alice joined her father at Arlington
Cemetery to bury her brother... with honors.

01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:36.442
Alice promised she'd come back,
and I promised the timing would be right.

01:31:36.512 --> 01:31:40.505
Anyway, Robin Masters called last night
from Paris.

01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:42.517
Higgins was out, so I answered.

01:31:42.585 --> 01:31:47.579
He said three French stews would be in for the
weekend, and would I ask Higgins to show them Hawaii?

01:31:47.657 --> 01:31:49.591
Naturally, I volunteered.

01:31:49.659 --> 01:31:53.425
T.C. was flying them here in the chopper
and then we were all heading for Rick's.

01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:58.359
When Higgins found out,
he kinda forgot I'd saved his life.
