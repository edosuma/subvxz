00:31.449 --> 00:35.119
Man, what a downpour!

00:35.119 --> 00:39.039
Uh oh, everything's soaked.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.541
Hey, anybody here?

00:40.541 --> 00:43.085
Just follow the
muddy footprints.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.087
Oh, nice weather...

00:45.087 --> 00:46.839
if you're a dolphin.

00:46.839 --> 00:50.175
I wouldn't sit there, unless
you want to go for a swim,

00:50.175 --> 00:52.511
Flipper.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.805
Oh, right.

00:53.805 --> 00:56.975
Try the ground, it's drier.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.980
Hi guys!

01:01.980 --> 01:03.397
It's pretty icky out.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.857
Icky?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.191
Why are you guys
sitting on the ground?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.444
Cuz the furniture is like...
liquid.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.279
I still wouldn't sit there.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.781
Why not?
Duh!

01:11.781 --> 01:14.033
Do you know how many
things live in the ground?

01:14.033 --> 01:16.285
Worms, slugs, bugs...

01:16.285 --> 01:18.245
none of them are pretty.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.790
So?
They won't hurt you.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.167
Ah, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.594
My story's about
that very thing.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.513
It's about what you can't see...

01:35.513 --> 01:38.098
just under the ground.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.018
Who knows what
you're stepping on?

01:40.018 --> 01:43.688
Who knows if the very next step
you take is onto something that

01:43.688 --> 01:45.606
DOESN'T want to be stepped on...

01:45.606 --> 01:48.233
that has the power...

01:48.233 --> 01:52.446
to step BACK on you!

01:52.446 --> 01:56.158
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.203
I call this story...

02:23.310 --> 02:26.064
Look, a full moon!

02:26.064 --> 02:27.523
Not quite.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.774
Probably tomorrow night.

02:28.774 --> 02:34.030
Whatever.
It's still romantic.

02:34.030 --> 02:37.742
Look at how your ring
shines in the moonlight.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.619
Cool.

02:40.619 --> 02:44.623
Did you know John gave Liz
his varsity ring yesterday?

02:44.623 --> 02:46.667
Yeah, I heard.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.587
It seems like
everybody's hooking up.

02:49.587 --> 02:53.007
Well, almost everybody.

02:54.759 --> 02:58.137
Whoa!
Check it out!

03:01.348 --> 03:02.725
Did you see that?

03:02.725 --> 03:05.310
Ah, it was
probably a shooting star.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.521
You should make a wish.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.482
That was no shooting
star, that was a...

03:10.482 --> 03:12.110
I don't know what that was.

03:12.110 --> 03:15.947
Well, if it were
a shooting star,

03:15.947 --> 03:19.158
you know what I'd wish for?

03:19.158 --> 03:20.785
I'm sorry, did
you say something?

03:20.785 --> 03:23.079
Ah, forget it.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.159
Julie...!

03:32.588 --> 03:34.506
What's the problem?
Julie's great!

03:34.506 --> 03:35.758
I know!

03:35.758 --> 03:38.761
But being exclusive is so...
final.

03:38.761 --> 03:41.680
Second only to death.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.854
Don't be a fool, man. It's not
like you've got other girls

03:48.854 --> 03:50.815
throwing themselves at you.

03:50.815 --> 03:53.567
Hi.
Can I sit with you?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.903
Or at least not usually.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.279
You wanna sit here?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.697
I don't bite.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.283
Uhh, yeah, of course.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.827
Um, I'm Jake.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.036
My name's Ellen.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.329
I just transferred in.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.832
Hi Ellen! My name's...

04:07.832 --> 04:10.168
I bet you play football.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.211
Uh, yeah!
I'm varsity quarterback.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.838
Ah, I knew it!

04:13.838 --> 04:16.298
Is there any chance of getting
the varsity quarterback

04:16.298 --> 04:18.176
to show me around
my new school?

04:18.176 --> 04:21.428
I mean, if you're available.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.140
Me?
Well sure I...

04:24.140 --> 04:26.017
He's not available.

04:26.017 --> 04:27.893
Hi, I'm...
Leaving?

04:27.893 --> 04:30.604
Great, thanks for
saving my seat.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.608
Sure. I sort of lost
my appetite anyway.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.944
See ya later Jake.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.144
Bye Ellen!

04:40.656 --> 04:45.870
What rock did she
crawl out from under?

04:45.870 --> 04:48.998
You are not making points here.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.142
Hi!

05:10.435 --> 05:11.603
You scared me.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.981
Sorry.
What are you doing?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.357
Looking up UFOs.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.359
I saw this weird light
in the sky last night.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.196
Nice ring.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.156
Thanks, I found the
stone on the beach.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.283
It's beautiful.

05:24.283 --> 05:27.203
Can I try it on?

05:27.203 --> 05:28.003
Uhh, yeah, sure.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.378
Jake!

05:38.380 --> 05:41.926
Julie, hi, I was just...

05:41.926 --> 05:44.053
We've got Spanish.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.471
Spanish.
Right.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.016
I'm comin'.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.145
I gotta go.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.605
Wait!

05:54.605 --> 05:57.024
I was, huh, hoping that
you could give me a...

05:57.024 --> 05:59.985
a computer lesson,
today, after school.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.114
Because I'm really
lost with all this stuff.

06:03.114 --> 06:07.326
Uh, well sure, I guess but,
school closes up after class.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.660
Oh.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.996
Well, do you have a
computer at home?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.915
Like at my house? Yeah.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.792
Then let's do it there!

06:14.792 --> 06:18.879
Okay.
That'd be cool.

06:18.879 --> 06:24.009
After school, today, you and me.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
Bye.

07:18.105 --> 07:18.855
Hi!

07:20.524 --> 07:22.609
She's totally strange.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.819
Who?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.488
Your new "friend"
whats-her-name.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.241
I watched her on the
football field for over an hour.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.118
She was measuring
and digging like a,

07:31.118 --> 07:32.619
like a...

07:32.619 --> 07:34.663
well I don't know
what it was like,

07:34.663 --> 07:36.081
but it was weird.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.500
You spied on her for an
hour and she's weird?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.170
I don't know...

07:41.170 --> 07:44.798
You and I need to talk.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.384
What are you doing after school?

07:46.384 --> 07:48.927
Nuthin'. We can... uh...

07:48.927 --> 07:52.056
ah, hum...I can't, I've
got way too much homework.

07:52.056 --> 07:55.684
Since when do you do homework?
[bell rings]

07:55.684 --> 07:58.729
I gotta fly.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.812
Aaaaaaah!

09:25.816 --> 09:26.896
Aaaaaaah!

09:29.403 --> 09:32.948
I am so outta here.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.711
Hello!
-Hi!

09:46.711 --> 09:48.213
Ready?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.090
Okay!
Let's go!

09:50.090 --> 09:51.883
I checked registration.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.678
There's no record of
any new transfers.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.849
She's not even a student here.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.113
Break time, I'm starving.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.448
Me too.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.992
My dad made me some sandwiches.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.548
In-coming!

10:33.175 --> 10:35.344
What's a matter?
It's PB and J.

10:35.344 --> 10:39.848
Sorry I'm, uh, allergic.

10:39.848 --> 10:43.018
Could you get rid
of that please?

10:43.018 --> 10:45.979
Sorry.
No problemo.

10:50.568 --> 10:52.361
You, huh, want something else?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.530
No thanks.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.448
Something to drink?

10:56.448 --> 10:57.168
Mmmmm.

11:01.953 --> 11:02.793
You OK?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.458
I'm fine.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.293
But it's getting late.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.587
Can you take me home?

11:09.587 --> 11:10.879
Yeah, okay.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.924
I'll go get my keys.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.913
You huh, live in the woods?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.582
What're you doing?

11:46.582 --> 11:50.377
Jake, I know you have a steady
girlfriend and everything.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.379
Well, she's not
exactly steady...

11:52.379 --> 11:55.840
And I don't want to make you
do anything you don't want to.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.093
Like what?

11:58.093 --> 12:03.599
Well, it's just that you're
so cute I could eat you up.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.309
Yeah?

12:05.309 --> 12:08.353
I mean, I think you're
pretty cute too and all but...

12:08.353 --> 12:12.650
Jake, I'd really love
to be your girlfriend...

12:12.650 --> 12:17.321
and wear your ring.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.739
Will life always be this cool?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.949
Let me try it on.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.199
Wait.

12:24.453 --> 12:29.040
I think you're great,
but I have a girlfriend.

12:29.040 --> 12:34.463
I mean, I like you, but
I couldn't do that to Julie.

12:34.463 --> 12:38.342
I can't change your mind?

12:38.342 --> 12:39.542
I'm sorry.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.431
OK then, here we go.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.018
Hey, the car door just locked!

12:48.018 --> 12:48.858
I know.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.315
But neither of us...?

12:57.277 --> 13:01.323
Now give me that ring.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.866
Aaaaaaaaaahh...

13:04.826 --> 13:06.953
Aaaahhh...

13:13.585 --> 13:15.337
Shhh.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.382
It's OK, I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:18.382 --> 13:21.843
Just promise not to
scream and I'll move my hand.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.093
Okay?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.601
I'm sorry I scared you,
but you left me no choice.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.062
Who are you?
What are you?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.523
You remember that
light you saw in the sky?

13:34.523 --> 13:36.775
Yeah that was...
that was you???

13:36.775 --> 13:38.402
I'm not from here, Jake.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.238
I really don't look like
this, I'm much prettier

13:41.238 --> 13:42.740
in my regular form.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.783
Oh, yeah!
With bug eyes and 6 foot arms?

13:44.783 --> 13:46.326
That is not regular.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.704
For ME it is.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.288
Can I please get up?

13:50.288 --> 13:52.207
Promise not to run away?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.167
I swear.

14:06.555 --> 14:10.517
Please don't try that again.
What do you want from me?

14:10.517 --> 14:13.812
I need your help.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.443
"Flesh eating
bacteria strikes again."

14:19.443 --> 14:21.111
It's not bacteria.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.405
It's a parasite that
travels from planet to planet,

14:23.405 --> 14:26.199
eating everything in it's path.
Like locusts.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.909
This stuff is
from another planet?

14:27.909 --> 14:31.371
My partner and I are the
only survivors from my planet.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.498
Those parasites
they ate everything,

14:33.498 --> 14:35.125
and everyone.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.669
It was horrible.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.755
So why did you follow them here?

14:39.755 --> 14:42.090
To try to stop them
before they destroy earth,

14:42.090 --> 14:45.636
the way they destroyed my home

14:45.636 --> 14:48.722
and... to find a new home.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.740
So you're telling me you're like
a lizard-girl from outer space

15:06.740 --> 15:09.993
on a mission to destroy a band
of intergalactic flesh eating

15:09.993 --> 15:13.831
parasites that wanna earth
and then make this your home?

15:13.831 --> 15:17.167
That's about it.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.920
Cool.
So why'd you pick me?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.173
'Cause I'm like, a
trained athlete?

15:23.173 --> 15:26.301
Well... no.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.685
Whoa!

15:34.685 --> 15:36.144
That was my partner's.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.396
We need them both to
destroy the locusts.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.565
What happened to your partner?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.776
You found that on the beach...

15:42.776 --> 15:45.362
he must have
crashed in the ocean.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.865
I'm sorry.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.409
So the only reason you
wanted to go out with me

15:51.409 --> 15:55.121
was to get my ring,
not because you think I'm cute?

15:55.121 --> 15:58.124
Sorry.
You're not really my type.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.044
You're way too...
human.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.464
That's too bad...
I think.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
Hey!
-Aaah!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.259
It's okay!
I can explain...

16:08.259 --> 16:09.469
I think.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.722
She...
she's a monster!

16:11.722 --> 16:13.223
No! Well... yeah, sorta.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.725
But she needs my help.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.351
Everything is cool.
Trust me.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.645
I... I'm getting the police.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
Julie!
No!

16:20.480 --> 16:23.650
C'mon, we've got to move fast.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.829
The parasites are over there.
I don't see anything.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.288
Because they're underground.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.749
Under the football field?

16:38.749 --> 16:40.584
Yes, that's where the
mother laid her eggs.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.377
Eggs??
Like, they're gonna hatch?

16:42.377 --> 16:44.295
Tonight, unless we stop them.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.590
How?
With the stones.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.633
As soon as the full moon
rises over the school...

16:48.633 --> 16:50.051
There thay are!!!!

16:50.051 --> 16:53.137
Hold it right there kids.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.558
We have to get into the school.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.017
It's locked.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.269
Not for long.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.269
Hey!

17:16.578 --> 17:18.204
No, it's a dead end!

17:18.204 --> 17:19.164
Come on!

17:52.572 --> 17:55.408
How did we... stay... up...?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.827
Suction.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.328
Suction?

17:58.328 --> 17:59.746
I'm really sorry I asked.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.039
I hid my equipment here.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.749
I figured that if
anyone found it,

18:02.749 --> 18:05.752
they'd just think it was
part of a science experiment.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.712
Put these on when I tell you to.

18:07.712 --> 18:08.922
Why?

18:08.922 --> 18:12.592
I'll explain later.
Come on!

18:18.682 --> 18:21.184
We're running out of time.
What's the hurry?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.561
The lunar light will be
strongest when the moon

18:23.561 --> 18:25.480
gets fully over the school.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.901
And if we're not set up by
then, it's gonna be too late.

18:29.901 --> 18:33.030
They're going to stop us.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.907
Not if we get a
little diversion.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.506
Jake?

18:54.843 --> 18:56.219
What's going on??

18:56.219 --> 18:57.888
I don't have time to
explain it all now,

18:57.888 --> 19:00.640
but it's really, really
important that I help Ellen.

19:03.518 --> 19:07.313
But there's something
that you gotta know.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.273
You and I are the best.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.902
I mean, together.

19:11.902 --> 19:17.991
I really see that now, I
don't want to lose you.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.203
You mean that?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.474
What was that?

19:43.474 --> 19:46.103
I felt something move.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.812
There they are!

20:03.787 --> 20:06.790
Come out of there, now!

20:08.708 --> 20:11.294
Is that too loud?

20:11.294 --> 20:12.014
Sorry.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.557
They won't be gone for long!

20:24.557 --> 20:27.060
When I give you the signal
put your glasses on and toss

20:27.060 --> 20:29.771
the stone in the circle.
I'll do the same.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.272
That's it?
What does it do?

20:31.272 --> 20:33.399
You'll see.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.276
Thanks Jake.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.780
I'll never forget this.

20:45.578 --> 20:50.541
Hold it right there young lady.
-Jake!

20:50.541 --> 20:52.752
Let her go!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.002
Jake!

20:55.338 --> 20:58.049
Jake, you're our only hope!

21:07.058 --> 21:08.309
Yes!

21:08.309 --> 21:11.437
Jake!
The other one!

21:30.915 --> 21:32.209
No!!!!!!

21:32.209 --> 21:32.959
No!

21:37.505 --> 21:38.965
Julie!

21:38.965 --> 21:41.300
Throw it in the hoop!

21:41.300 --> 21:43.344
Put your glasses on!

21:43.344 --> 21:47.724
Julie, throw it in the hoop!
Cover your eyes!

22:03.240 --> 22:05.825
We did it!
We did it!

22:05.825 --> 22:07.075
Jake!

22:11.206 --> 22:12.415
You were incredible!

22:12.415 --> 22:14.792
Thanks, but, what did we do?

22:14.792 --> 22:17.879
We killed the flesh
eating alien locust!

22:17.879 --> 22:20.298
Here, read this.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.677
You're kidding right?

22:24.677 --> 22:25.929
No, read it!

22:25.929 --> 22:27.264
I did.

22:27.264 --> 22:29.266
This is about some
bacteria in Brazil

22:29.266 --> 22:31.642
they stopped with antibiotics.
But... but no.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.644
I mean, the mother
alien laid her eggs

22:33.644 --> 22:35.105
in the field and we zapped 'em!

22:35.105 --> 22:37.274
Mother alien?

22:37.274 --> 22:40.235
What mother alien?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.075
Ellen?

22:47.075 --> 22:49.286
We zapped 'em, right?

22:52.247 --> 22:53.207
(laughs)

23:12.558 --> 23:13.518
The end.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.314
Good story.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.774
Now I know why you didn't
want to sit on the ground.

23:19.774 --> 23:22.819
Well yeah...

23:22.819 --> 23:26.030
and I also don't like
getting my bottom wet.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.030
Bye!

23:28.366 --> 23:30.160
Ugh gross!

23:30.160 --> 23:31.369
Ugh man!

23:31.369 --> 23:33.830
I'm soaked!

23:38.542 --> 23:43.256
I really hope nobody
else can see this.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.925
This is definetly
the end.
