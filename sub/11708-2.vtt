24:18.498 --> 24:20.625
- FUCK YOU MEAN,
YOUR DIAMOND CHAIN?

24:20.709 --> 24:21.918
- YEAH.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.044
- COME ON, BRO.
- SWEAR TO GOD.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.548
- YOU BETTER FUCKING
FIND THAT SHIT, BRO.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.215
- WEIRD.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.218
- CHECK EVERYWHERE, BRO.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.556
- I'M FLIPPING OUT,
TRYING TO RETRACE MY STEPS.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.183
- I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE TOOK IT.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.184
I'M THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

24:37.267 --> 24:38.602
THE GIRL
THAT YOU BROUGHT HOME LAST NIGHT

24:38.685 --> 24:40.270
STOLE YOUR CHAIN, OBVI.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.314
- YEAH, BUT SHE LEFT
WITH NOTHING, I SEEN.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.524
- SHE PROBABLY STUFFED IT
IN HER ASSHOLE.

24:48.862 --> 24:53.158
- MAYBE.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.119
- [laughing] WELL,
IT'S NOT UNDER THE BED.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.038
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY DIAMOND CHAIN.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.665
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GIRL
STOLE IT, IF I GAVE IT TO HER,

25:00.749 --> 25:02.918
IF I PUT IT ON HER,
BUT IT'S MISSING

25:03.001 --> 25:04.544
AND IT'S
MY FAVORITE GOLD CHAIN.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.795
- WHAT THE HELL GOES ON
IN THIS HOUSE?

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
HMM.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.132
- I'M TIRED.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.425
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE CLUB,

25:10.508 --> 25:11.927
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE EVERY NIGHT.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.762
- I COULD JUST SEE IT
IN VIN'S FACE THAT HE'S, LIKE,

25:13.845 --> 25:15.180
AT THAT BREAKING POINT.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.474
- I'M DWELLING IN MY PROBLEM.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.059
THAT'S NOT MAKING IT BETTER.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.607
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T FIND MY CHAIN.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.610
I'M TRYING TO THINK,
I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE I PUT IT.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.987
- IT'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT IN HERE.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.616
[knocking at the door]
- MY SNEAKERS WERE STILL

25:34.699 --> 25:37.452
IN THERE, MY SUNGLASSES
WERE STILL IN THERE.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.119
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S
THE BITCH FROM LAST NIGHT.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.081
- MAYBE SHE HAS IT.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.208
- YEAH, SHE GOT IT.
- SHE GOT IT?

25:43.291 --> 25:45.335
- WHAT'S UP, BABE?
- HEY.

25:45.418 --> 25:46.169
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

25:46.253 --> 25:47.337
- WHAT THE HELL?

25:47.420 --> 25:49.297
- I SEE MY DIAMOND CHAIN
GLISTENING IN THE SUN,

25:49.381 --> 25:50.382
LIKE LOOKING ALL PERFECT.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259
I'M LIKE, "PHEW!"
THANK GOD.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.551
- HOLY SHIT!

25:53.635 --> 25:55.136
- YO, WE WAS LIKE--
RIPPED THE WHOLE HOUSE APART.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.763
- [laughing] I--
I HAD YOUR I.D., I'M LIKE,

25:56.846 --> 25:58.723
HONESTLY, I WOKE UP THIS
MORNING, AND I'M LIKE,

25:58.807 --> 26:00.058
"OH, WHAT DO I HAVE?
- [laughs]

26:00.141 --> 26:01.601
- OH, MY GOD.
[laughter]

26:01.685 --> 26:02.310
CONGRATULATIONS.
- SO I WAS LIKE,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.813
"I--I CAN'T KEEP THAT."

26:04.896 --> 26:06.439
- SHE'S LIKE ALL HAPPY,
LIKE, "OH, YEAH, I FORGOT

26:06.523 --> 26:07.983
TO GIVE YOU THIS BACK."
I'M LIKE,

26:08.066 --> 26:09.067
"YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!"

26:09.150 --> 26:10.318
- AND--
- YEAH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING,

26:10.402 --> 26:11.319
OUT TO THE BEACH?
- I WANT MY SHOES.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.946
- WHERE ARE THEY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.572
- LET'S FIND THEM.
- [giggles]

26:14.656 --> 26:15.865
- THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR GOING
INTO THE NASTY-ASS SMOOSH ROOM,

26:15.949 --> 26:18.410
LIKE, I'LL NEVER GO
IN THE SMOOSH ROOM AGAIN.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.327
- THE FUNNIEST THING
JUST HAPPENED.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.870
- WHAT?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.664
- WE GET A KNOCK AT THE DOOR,
IT'S THE GIRL FROM LAST NIGHT,

26:22.747 --> 26:23.707
AND SHE'S WEARING THE CHAIN.
- SHUT UP.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.126
- SHE'S UPSTAIRS
RIGHT NOW WITH HIM.

26:26.209 --> 26:29.587
- I FEEL LIKE THE GIRL
JUST TOOK PAULY'S CHAIN

26:29.671 --> 26:30.839
SO THE NEXT DAY
SHE CAN COME BACK

26:30.922 --> 26:34.843
AND SEE PAULY AGAIN,
AND PROBABLY TRY AND SMASH.

26:34.926 --> 26:35.468
- LIKE THIS?
- NO.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.387
- I WOULD DO THAT.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.972
- WHEN DID YOU TAKE THEM OFF?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.640
- I DON'T KNOW.
- NEITHER DO I.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.351
WE'RE LOOKING AROUND, AND THEY
ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.687
SO SHE LOST HER DIGNITY,
HER SELF-RESPECT,

26:45.770 --> 26:47.147
SO WHAT THE HELL
YOU NEED SHOES FOR?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.523
[laughs]

26:48.606 --> 26:50.191
IF I FIND THE SHOES,
I'LL CALL YOU.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.277
- THEY'RE BLACK
WITH WOOD HEELS.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.653
- SO I'M NOW
COMING UP WITH A NEW PLAN.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.863
WHENEVER A GIRL LEAVES
THE HOUSE, I'M GOING TO HUG HER

26:54.946 --> 26:57.866
AND THEN PAT HER DOWN
AT THE SAME EXACT TIME.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.618
- ...THE HELL?
- WELL?

27:00.702 --> 27:01.953
- I'M NOT DRINKING,
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.914
TILL TONIGHT.
[laughs]

27:08.960 --> 27:10.170
- READY?

27:10.253 --> 27:12.589
- WE HAVE TWO MINUTES
TO GET TO WORK?

27:13.798 --> 27:14.883
- ANYBODY HERE?

27:14.966 --> 27:16.468
HELLO?

27:16.551 --> 27:18.219
ANYBODY HOME?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.472
I'M DEFINITELY NOT FEELING
LIKE MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

27:20.555 --> 27:25.894
I AM REALLY, REALLY ANXIOUS,
AND THE ANXIETY HAS PRETTY MUCH

27:25.977 --> 27:29.773
OVERCOME, YOU KNOW,
MY ENTIRE BEING HERE.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.818
ANYBODY HOME?

27:33.902 --> 27:34.361
- VIN?
- YEAH.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.029
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:36.112 --> 27:37.530
- YEAH.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.281
- WANT TO DO SOMETHING?
GO DOWN TO THE BOARDWALK?

27:38.365 --> 27:40.450
RIDES?
- PUSHING--

27:40.533 --> 27:41.409
NOT RIDES OR PUSHING GAMES.
- YEAH.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.079
- WIN SOME SHIT, VIN.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.622
[laughs]

27:47.582 --> 27:49.000
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY,
GOOD?

27:49.084 --> 27:50.377
- I FEEL SHITTY.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.252
- SORT OF LIKE
EVERY OTHER DAY.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.379
[laughter]

27:52.462 --> 27:55.048
- WITH VIN IT'S LIKE,
I LOVE THE KID.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.467
HE'S BEEN MY FRIEND
SINCE DAY ONE IN THIS HOUSE.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.094
WANT TO GO ON THE FERRIS WHEEL
AND MAKE OUT?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.096
[laughter]

28:01.179 --> 28:03.556
HIM GOING THROUGH STUFF, IT,
LIKE, IT HURTS ME,

28:03.640 --> 28:05.433
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT,

28:05.517 --> 28:07.227
AND I FEEL LIKE HE CAN
SNAP OUT OF IT,

28:07.310 --> 28:09.312
OR, LIKE,
YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.481
- OH!
- [laughs]

28:13.400 --> 28:15.443
- OH, HEY!
- YEAH!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.779
- THERE GOES ANOTHER BIG ONE.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.822
- [laughs]

28:18.905 --> 28:19.322
CAN I TOUCH IT?

28:19.406 --> 28:22.283
[laughter]

28:22.367 --> 28:25.412
- I REALLY APPRECIATE RONNIE
TRYING TO CHEER ME UP,

28:25.495 --> 28:29.040
BUT I'M LIKE A LITTLE BIT
BEYOND THAT POINT RIGHT NOW.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.458
- I'M TIRED.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.918
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE CLUB,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

28:32.001 --> 28:33.545
LIKE EVERY NIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

28:33.628 --> 28:34.879
- YOU DO OR YOU DON'T?
- I DON'T.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.758
THE THING, TOO, IS THAT
I'M DWELLING IN MY PROBLEMS.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.468
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
LIKE, THAT'S NOT

28:40.552 --> 28:42.011
MAKING IT BETTER,
LIKE, YOU KNOW.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.180
I NEED, UM, REST.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.974
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
NOT LIKE SLEEP REST,

28:46.057 --> 28:48.435
I NEED, LIKE, REST.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.686
- I CAN JUST SEE IT
IN VIN'S FACE

28:49.769 --> 28:52.313
THAT HE'S, LIKE,
AT THAT BREAKING POINT.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.065
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I CAN SEE IT IN HIM.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.860
- LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO A CLUB?

28:56.943 --> 28:58.862
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

28:58.945 --> 29:00.864
A LOT OF THINGS
THAT ARE HAPPENING HERE

29:00.947 --> 29:03.324
ARE TRIGGERING
MY ANXIETY PROBLEMS.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.160
NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP,
ALL THE PARTYING,

29:05.243 --> 29:07.829
ALL THE STAYING UP,
ALL THE LOUDNESS,

29:07.912 --> 29:09.581
AND IT'S
A PRETTY SCARY FEELING.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.834
- ♪ SUMMER'S
TURNED ITS BACK ♪

29:12.917 --> 29:15.003
♪ AND LEFT FOR GOOD ♪

29:15.086 --> 29:18.798
- I HAVE A CHOICE: EITHER
NOT REACT TO THE CRAZINESS

29:18.882 --> 29:20.341
THAT HAPPENS AROUND ME...

29:20.425 --> 29:21.593
I GAVE UP DRINKING.

29:21.676 --> 29:22.343
DRINKING'S JUST
NOT GOOD FOR ME.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.054
...OR REMOVE MYSELF.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.514
EITHER WAY,
I HAVE A CHOICE.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.517
- ♪ 'CAUSE THIS IS

29:42.906 --> 29:44.365

REAL QUICK?

29:44.449 --> 29:47.035
I KEEP TRYING TO THINK
WHAT IT IS THAT HE NEEDS.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.120
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

30:03.176 --> 30:04.886
- WHERE'D YOU GO?
- DOWN TO THE BOARDWALK.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.263
- [laughs]
- GOT YOU A BULLDOG.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.057
HERE.
- AW.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.642
[kiss]

30:16.147 --> 30:17.524
- [sighs]

30:19.526 --> 30:20.777
- WHAT YOU DOING?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.445
- NOTHING.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.989
- ARE YOU SAD AGAIN?

30:25.073 --> 30:27.242
- YEAH.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.577
- YOU'RE GONNA STAY ALWAYS,
RIGHT?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.246
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.664
- WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

30:32.747 --> 30:34.582
- ANXIOUS.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.751
NOT MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

30:36.834 --> 30:39.254
- YOU GONNA DRINK TONIGHT,
OR NO?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.256
- NO, I'M NOT DRINKING AT ALL
ANYMORE.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.925
I'M NOT IN THE STATE OF MIND
TO BE DRINKING.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.260
- YEAH, I GET IT.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.887
FOR MY OWN SELFISH WAYS,
I DON'T WANT VINNY TO LEAVE.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.723
I'M LIKE, "JUST STICK IT OUT,
COME ON."

30:50.807 --> 30:52.267
BUT THEN AGAIN,
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF VINNY,

30:52.350 --> 30:55.061
LIKE, HOW HE'S FEELING,
AND IF HE'S NOT COMFORTABLE,

30:55.144 --> 30:56.521
HE NEEDS TO GO.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.815
WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.149
- I KNOW.
I'M SURE NOBODY DOES, BUT--

31:00.233 --> 31:02.527
- MM-MM.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.698
- I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST
DECISION FOR MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

31:06.781 --> 31:08.199
I KNOW THAT MY ROOMMATES

31:08.283 --> 31:10.743
ARE GONNA MAKE IT HARD ON ME
TO LEAVE, BUT ULTIMATELY,

31:10.827 --> 31:14.414
THIS IS MY DECISION, AND
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.457
- I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE
BEST FOR YOU NOW,

31:16.541 --> 31:18.876
AND THEN TWO WEEKS FROM NOW,
YOU'RE, LIKE, AT HOME,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.087
RIGHT BACK IN THE SAME SPOT
BECAUSE OF THE CHOICE YOU MADE.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.923
- LIKE, IF I MAKE
THE DECISION TO GO, LIKE--

31:24.007 --> 31:26.467
- NO.
- I WANT TO DO IT FROM, LIKE,

31:26.551 --> 31:28.720
A CALM STATE OF MIND,
LIKE RIGHT NOW,

31:28.803 --> 31:30.972
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, LIKE,

31:31.055 --> 31:32.974
WHERE I CAN'T SLEEP,
AND I'M NOT THINKING RATIONALLY

31:33.057 --> 31:34.309
AND I'M FLIPPING OUT.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.311
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.979
- [laughs]

31:38.062 --> 31:40.148
- RIGHT, THAT'S THE BEST ADVICE
ANYONE'S EVER GAVE ME

31:40.231 --> 31:43.776
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.994
- HELLO?
- HELLO?

31:53.077 --> 31:53.953
- HI.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.085
- WHAT CLUB
ARE WE GOING TO TONIGHT?

32:01.169 --> 32:02.378
- KARMA.
- OKAY.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.713
- VINNY'S SAD AGAIN.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

32:03.796 --> 32:04.881
- WHY?
- HE'S THINKING

32:04.964 --> 32:06.633
IF HE WANTS TO LEAVE OR NOT.
- NO.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.009
- LIKE, HE DOESN'T
WANT TO DRINK ANYMORE,

32:08.092 --> 32:09.677
SO HE'S LIKE--
- WHY?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.221
- 'CAUSE HE SAID THAT PEOPLE
LOOK TOWARDS THAT TO, LIKE,

32:12.305 --> 32:13.514
FIX THEIR PROBLEMS,
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.515
- IT'S TRUE.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.018
VINNY IS REALLY SAD,

32:17.101 --> 32:19.729
SO USUALLY WHEN ONE OF YOUR
ROOMMATES IS, LIKE, DEPRESSED,

32:19.812 --> 32:20.521
IT KIND OF
RUBS OFF ON ALL OF US.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.024
SO IT'S LIKE...

32:23.107 --> 32:25.109
DUDE, IF HE LEAVES, THIS HOUSE
IS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.694
- WE'RE GONNA BE SO UPSET.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.446
I'M GONNA BE SO UPSET
IF HE LEAVES.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.697
- AND PAULY.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.199
- [sighs]

32:33.409 --> 32:35.370
- I'M NOT GONNA DRINK
AT THE CLUB.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.704
- [laughs]

32:36.788 --> 32:38.539
AH, HA, HA, HA!
