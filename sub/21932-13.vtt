00:48.014 --> 00:51.045
Our contestants are really
in the thick of it now!

00:51.110 --> 00:53.247
Whose dish will be the finest?

00:53.276 --> 00:56.191
Who will make the most
out of the delicious,

00:56.220 --> 00:59.789
nutritious Madison's Fine Beef?

01:00.638 --> 01:04.099
What do you have for
us today, Mrs. Tucker?

01:04.224 --> 01:10.534
Ahh! Another mÃ©lange of 100
unappealing ingredients it seems.

01:10.659 --> 01:12.520
Isn't he great?

01:12.563 --> 01:15.233
He's just insulting all the dishes.

01:15.358 --> 01:17.536
And you assured me the
turnout would be better.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.767
Ah, Miss Cooper.

01:19.803 --> 01:23.695
Yours looks even worse, if
such a thing is possible.

01:24.515 --> 01:27.377
My cream toast is divine, sir.

01:27.797 --> 01:29.265
Thomas!

01:31.548 --> 01:33.041
Thomas!

01:33.116 --> 01:35.165
- Try this!
- What is it?

01:35.177 --> 01:36.709
It's my frizzled beef.

01:36.755 --> 01:39.645
It's the only thing I could make
to disguise this God-awful meat.

01:39.686 --> 01:41.511
- Mm! It's not bad.
- No, Thomas!

01:41.528 --> 01:44.050
More lunch counter
slop, eh, Mr. Douglas?

01:44.850 --> 01:48.340
Loose-meat with stale
Sally Lunn, it appears?

01:49.906 --> 01:51.823
Mr. Crabtree!

01:51.841 --> 01:53.855
Spare your insults, sir.

01:53.884 --> 01:57.793
I promise you, you have never
tried the likes of my aunt Fern's

01:57.841 --> 02:00.610
- apple beef balls.
- How appetizing.

02:00.644 --> 02:02.788
You know, this really
is a wonderful set up.

02:02.837 --> 02:04.990
Much better than I have at
home in my boarding room.

02:05.030 --> 02:06.481
You wouldn't believe how hard it is

02:06.504 --> 02:08.265
to make jiggs dinner on a camping stove.

02:08.318 --> 02:10.787
It's a wonder you find joy in life.

02:10.851 --> 02:12.336
- Ah!
- George!

02:12.388 --> 02:15.773
Finally Mrs. Brackenreid...

02:15.836 --> 02:17.103
Sir.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.722
Achevez, Monsieur Gordon !

02:19.953 --> 02:22.860
A-ha! We have a dish.

02:24.242 --> 02:25.693
Let's see...

02:31.266 --> 02:33.409
Oh my, this looks unappetizing.

02:33.630 --> 02:37.042
Is this the best a
finely-trained chef can conjure?

02:39.330 --> 02:41.951
Mm! This is slop.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.115
Terrible !

02:44.151 --> 02:47.425
Inedible! You really are
just a frog-faced buffoon,

02:47.426 --> 02:49.851
aren't you, Prideaux? You should be a...

02:49.893 --> 02:52.320
ashamed...

02:52.445 --> 02:54.601
ashamed... you should be ashamed of...

02:54.665 --> 02:57.533
you should... I wouldn't pay...

02:59.671 --> 03:02.618
- Oh, dear!
- What's happening?!

03:02.743 --> 03:05.295
- Is he all right?
- Is he all right?!

03:06.202 --> 03:08.836
What have you done to me?!

03:08.961 --> 03:12.088
Non ! Non ! Mon Dieu !

03:12.146 --> 03:14.183
C'est pas moi !

03:21.676 --> 03:25.274
He was fine one moment, sir,
full of his usual acrid vigour.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.685
Then he had one bite of
Monsieur Prideaux's dish...

03:27.810 --> 03:29.527
The Frenchman poisoned him.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.898
It's impossible to say at this
point. I mean, I suppose he could have

03:31.932 --> 03:33.239
had a stroke.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.066
Perhaps we'll have a word
with the Frenchman nonetheless.

03:38.046 --> 03:41.305
The circumstance suggests
a sudden onset of symptoms.

03:41.328 --> 03:43.366
Prussic Acid came to mind.

03:44.143 --> 03:46.424
Well, it wouldn't cause
this level of paralysis.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.463
Can you swallow, Mr. Gordon?

03:49.901 --> 03:52.508
Not easily.

03:52.525 --> 03:56.182
- What about speech?
- Can't...

03:56.552 --> 03:58.594
It must be a neurological toxin

03:58.640 --> 04:01.389
but I've never seen symptoms
quite so devastating.

04:01.423 --> 04:07.086
That bastard tried... to kill me!

04:11.449 --> 04:13.430
One bite of this and he fell ill?

04:13.464 --> 04:15.335
Sir, he positively keeled over.

04:15.364 --> 04:17.471
I mean, the whole contest
had to be cancelled.

04:17.511 --> 04:20.286
A shame. It looks terrific.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.752
I think I'll go out for
lunch, anyone care to join me?

04:24.899 --> 04:28.514
This disappoints me, but I soldier on.

04:30.218 --> 04:31.876
Right. We'll have to test the dish

04:31.899 --> 04:34.185
to ensure that it is indeed
the source of the poison.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.574
I assume you'll want to
get started right away?

04:37.219 --> 04:40.253
That poor man has lost
nearly all of his faculties.

04:40.378 --> 04:41.842
Indeed.

04:42.504 --> 04:45.250
- So you'll test the dish?
- Hmm?

04:46.632 --> 04:49.396
- Yes. Of course.
- Thank you.

04:50.322 --> 04:51.934
George, the chef?

04:51.969 --> 04:53.367
Sir, he's in your office.

04:53.413 --> 04:56.435
A little bit loopy, you
know, he's... very French.

04:56.769 --> 04:59.302
I did nothing, I swear.

04:59.561 --> 05:01.386
Well, I could hardly blame you. I mean,

05:01.403 --> 05:04.127
the man did call you
a frog-faced buffoon.

05:04.340 --> 05:08.698
- I am not a frog-faced buffoon!
- Well, I'm not calling you a frog-faced buffoon.

05:08.744 --> 05:10.385
I'm merely saying that Mr. Gordon

05:10.437 --> 05:11.945
called you a frog-faced buffoon,

05:11.963 --> 05:14.306
and you did not seem
to care for being called

05:14.346 --> 05:16.281
- a frog-faced buffoon...
- Stop saying that!

05:16.327 --> 05:18.596
Du calme, Monsieur Prideaux.

05:19.079 --> 05:20.939
Je m'excuse, Detective.

05:20.968 --> 05:24.405
The fact is, our constables
interviewed the other contestants,

05:24.439 --> 05:28.119
and they claim you called
him a "damnable boor"

05:28.124 --> 05:30.865
with "the heart of a vile despot,"

05:30.923 --> 05:33.657
"unworthy of a swift demise."

05:33.681 --> 05:35.966
I may have said some
of those things, but...

05:36.018 --> 05:38.039
it was only talk. We
are rivals after all.

05:38.079 --> 05:40.394
So then who poisoned your dish? No one!

05:40.423 --> 05:43.715
C'est impossible. I am
always in control of my plate.

05:47.504 --> 05:50.832
The most common neurological
toxins are heavy metals.

05:50.854 --> 05:53.894
Cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury...

05:54.222 --> 05:56.301
But those wouldn't react quickly enough.

05:56.426 --> 06:00.935
No, but some animal toxins
work almost instantaneously.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.250
- Maybe bufotoxin.
- So how do we test for it?

06:04.375 --> 06:08.173
First we need to make sure the
poison came from the dish in question.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.851
I am sorry.

06:14.879 --> 06:17.579
- Detective Watts.
- Oh, you.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.082
- Yes?
- I have a tip for you.

06:19.099 --> 06:21.310
It's on the subject of processed meat.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.860
Let's assume Mr. Prideaux
is telling the truth.

06:27.056 --> 06:30.896
Is it possible that another
contestant interfered with his dish?

06:31.167 --> 06:32.853
I should think it possible, sir.

06:32.916 --> 06:34.891
And Mr. Gordon's not the kindest of men.

06:34.914 --> 06:36.578
Dickie Douglas warned us of that.

06:36.703 --> 06:39.358
- Who is Dickie Douglas?
- One of the contestants.

06:39.392 --> 06:42.012
He works for Madison, the
sponsors of the whole thing.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.693
He's a cook at their lunch counter.

06:43.768 --> 06:45.795
Apparently, Mr. Gordon
ate there every day

06:45.829 --> 06:48.866
- and never failed to hurl a fresh insult at the man.
- Gentlemen...

06:49.116 --> 06:51.886
- I may have broken your case.
- Oh?

06:52.278 --> 06:55.104
- Oh.
- George, William, hear me out.

06:55.346 --> 06:57.534
A few days ago, someone telephoned me.

06:57.747 --> 06:59.526
They refused to divulge their identity,

06:59.537 --> 07:01.858
calling themself "The Good Samaritan."

07:01.886 --> 07:04.534
The last anonymous source
you brought us was a fake.

07:04.659 --> 07:08.291
- This one's real.
- Forgive me if I maintain skepticism.

07:09.051 --> 07:12.102
He had information regarding
Madison's Tinned Goods.

07:12.114 --> 07:15.487
He said their new product
was a hazard to public health.

07:15.516 --> 07:18.130
The tinned beef? What kind of hazard?

07:18.255 --> 07:19.915
Tainted meat.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.934
It was most certainly tainted.

07:24.141 --> 07:26.773
- Botulism.
- Botulism?

07:27.061 --> 07:29.933
- What's botulism?
- A bacteria found in sausages,

07:29.945 --> 07:32.518
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Very good, Detective.

07:32.564 --> 07:35.696
Its defining factor is that it
grows in anaerobic environments,

07:35.725 --> 07:37.341
sausage casing being one.

07:37.382 --> 07:40.163
- A tin can would be another.
- Precisely.

07:40.197 --> 07:43.852
Occurrences have been on the rise
with the popularity of tinned goods.

07:43.916 --> 07:45.891
So we all could have
been cooking with poison.

07:45.919 --> 07:50.513
Not exactly. It takes effect
between 6 and 36 hours.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.554
So our victim wasn't
poisoned by this dish.

07:53.588 --> 07:58.385
Our friends here ate it one hour
ago and remain in perfect health.

07:58.874 --> 08:01.637
Although I did ask Mr. Gordon
to give a list of everything

08:01.638 --> 08:03.286
he'd eaten over the last two days,

08:03.337 --> 08:05.531
and he says he's had
no other tinned goods.

08:05.589 --> 08:07.553
That's not entirely so.

08:07.678 --> 08:09.576
All the contestants and Mr. Gordon

08:09.597 --> 08:11.949
had a publicity photo
taken yesterday afternoon.

08:11.995 --> 08:15.643
And for the camera, he ate a
big spoonful of the tinned beef.

08:15.677 --> 08:17.955
Now, he spat it out
right away afterward.

08:18.007 --> 08:20.442
Well, even a small amount
can have a severe effect.

08:20.494 --> 08:22.302
Well, that timing would make sense.

08:22.854 --> 08:25.128
But he... he'll be all right?

08:25.146 --> 08:26.427
His mind will remain conscious

08:26.436 --> 08:28.394
while his body shuts
down from the inside out.

08:28.656 --> 08:30.948
He will remain aware even
when his lungs stop working,

08:30.983 --> 08:33.821
slowly suffocating him to death.

08:34.558 --> 08:35.980
Everything all right, George?

08:36.030 --> 08:37.869
Sir, Mr. Gordon wasn't the only one

08:37.892 --> 08:40.256
who ate the tinned beef
for the camera yesterday.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.744
We all did.

08:58.570 --> 09:02.238
I suppose there's a chance that
your tin wasn't tainted, George.

09:02.273 --> 09:04.107
Sir, how can that be?

09:04.141 --> 09:06.605
Presumably if one can is
bad, the whole batch is.

09:06.818 --> 09:09.633
- That's likely true.
- So I'll die.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.257
I'll never get to see Egypt.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.783
Or Asia.

09:13.818 --> 09:16.592
Or any of those new provinces we
have now. How many do we have now?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.067
- Nine.
- Nine.

09:18.770 --> 09:20.245
Perhaps in the future,
we'll have even more.

09:20.254 --> 09:21.847
I'll never know. I'll be dead.

09:22.326 --> 09:24.022
It must be difficult

09:24.040 --> 09:27.495
to confront the prospect of
one's own demise, George...

09:28.697 --> 09:30.037
Oh sir, that's wonderful.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.302
I thought you would at least
have some words of reassurance.

09:33.509 --> 09:34.604
Well...

09:35.159 --> 09:38.839
the mortality rate from
botulism is no more than 80%.

09:38.868 --> 09:40.422
80%?!

09:51.141 --> 09:54.728
What is this, some kind of gambit
to knock me out of the contest?

09:54.740 --> 09:56.704
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Brackenreid.

09:56.727 --> 09:58.477
I mean, there are constables rounding up

09:58.494 --> 10:00.806
the other contestants right
now so I can inform them.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.027
What nonsense! I feel just fine.

10:04.045 --> 10:05.242
I feel cold.

10:05.276 --> 10:07.429
I feel we should maybe go
home and talk to the boys.

10:07.453 --> 10:11.316
Oh, Thomas! Stop! Clearly I'm not dying.

10:11.788 --> 10:12.979
However...

10:13.025 --> 10:17.424
if some of the other contestants
have weaker constitutions, so be it.

10:17.549 --> 10:19.538
Crabtree, take your feet off the couch.

10:19.566 --> 10:21.276
Sorry, sir.

10:27.051 --> 10:29.475
I'm afraid a tin of Madison's beef

10:29.521 --> 10:32.129
is the only possible
source of the toxin.

10:32.152 --> 10:33.960
Well, what are we to do?

10:33.977 --> 10:37.800
First you'll surrender any can
that could possibly be tainted.

10:38.082 --> 10:40.028
How do we tell which ones are tainted?

10:40.592 --> 10:44.270
We have to assume that any one
of them could contain the poison.

10:44.395 --> 10:47.045
- But that would mean...
- You'll have every last tin.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.624
- What?
- We'll go to the papers.

10:49.664 --> 10:51.996
Inform everyone. Call
on all of our customers

10:52.042 --> 10:54.250
to return to us every can.

10:54.616 --> 10:56.252
But that would ruin us.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.565
Our competitors will
drum us out of business.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.955
Honesty is our only option here.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.010
We apologize and...

11:03.051 --> 11:05.993
- hope the people forgive us.
- Mr. Madison.

11:06.195 --> 11:07.873
Lives are at stake.

11:09.005 --> 11:10.554
I think that I have a fever.

11:10.679 --> 11:12.684
Do you think I hen a fever Havry?

11:12.809 --> 11:15.494
Oh my goodness, did you hear
that? I'm jumbling my words now...

11:15.619 --> 11:17.504
this is definitely it for me.

11:17.629 --> 11:20.285
I may not even have time to tell Nina.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.042
Maybe you shouldn't.

11:24.090 --> 11:27.912
It could be my last night on earth,
Higgins! I have to tell my lover.

11:27.930 --> 11:29.248
Please don't use that word.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.837
My sweetheart. You know what
I mean. I have to tell her.

11:33.434 --> 11:34.876
I don't think you do.

11:36.180 --> 11:37.750
You'll be dead by morning.

11:38.179 --> 11:41.227
I wouldn't want to spend my
last night watching a girl cry.

11:41.889 --> 11:44.836
You're telling me if it was your
last night, you wouldn't tell Ruth?

11:45.636 --> 11:47.121
Definitely not.

11:47.478 --> 11:50.551
So, what would you do?
Spend your life's savings on

11:50.563 --> 11:52.727
a bottle of whiskey and
a trip to the bordello?

11:53.286 --> 11:55.511
I didn't say I wouldn't
spend it with Ruth.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.114
I'd just...

11:58.548 --> 12:00.650
want one last beautiful night.

12:03.107 --> 12:04.888
That's actually quite thoughtful, Henry.

12:08.473 --> 12:09.859
Well...

12:09.894 --> 12:12.300
if this is really it.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.932
Goodbye, Higgins.

12:30.224 --> 12:32.115
So long, old chum.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.923
And finally, the case that was
opened for the promotional photograph.

12:39.957 --> 12:41.740
We should start there.

12:42.851 --> 12:44.878
I don't think this is a good idea.

12:45.137 --> 12:48.280
- Why not?
- What are we to learn?

12:48.355 --> 12:50.249
It's all just ground up intestines,

12:50.261 --> 12:53.531
barely worthy of feeding to farm
animals. Can't we simply destroy it?

12:53.656 --> 12:56.884
We need to determine how
widespread the problem could be.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.895
The only test we have
takes hours, and...

13:01.096 --> 13:04.067
and we don't know everything
there is to know about this toxin.

13:04.078 --> 13:05.506
It could be airborne.

13:05.631 --> 13:07.654
But it's anaerobic.

13:10.404 --> 13:12.598
So it says in one book!

13:12.628 --> 13:14.600
It's barely been tested.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.882
People are wrong about these
sorts of things all of the time.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.758
We could all die!

13:21.665 --> 13:24.315
Julia, is this because of...

13:24.908 --> 13:26.946
Is what because of what, William?

13:27.252 --> 13:29.911
Nothing. I don't know.

13:33.302 --> 13:35.041
I need some rest.

13:35.421 --> 13:37.631
Perhaps that's for the best.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.216
Don't tell me what's for the best!

13:46.036 --> 13:48.471
I should see her home.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.807
The testing can wait 'til morning.

13:50.198 --> 13:51.425
I could do it.

13:51.453 --> 13:53.273
Yes, but it could take all night.

13:54.119 --> 13:55.927
I never sleep much anyways.

13:56.980 --> 13:58.575
Thank you, Miss Hart.

14:08.488 --> 14:09.956
Higgins!

14:11.228 --> 14:12.495
It's me!

14:12.620 --> 14:13.883
Hi, George.

14:14.084 --> 14:17.786
"Hi, George"? Henry, I'm
alive, for Pete's sake.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.818
You could show a little enthusiasm.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.758
I'm busy picking out a gift for Ruth.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.793
Do you want me to tell the Detective?

14:23.827 --> 14:26.259
The Detective knows. He
called on me this morning,

14:26.282 --> 14:28.412
as did the Inspector,
presumably because they care

14:28.441 --> 14:30.266
about my existence on this earth!

14:30.300 --> 14:32.168
George, I knew you weren't gonna die.

14:32.293 --> 14:34.613
Ruth has a psychic.
He said you'd be fine.

14:35.735 --> 14:38.453
So you're telling me you knew I
wasn't going to die because Ruth

14:38.476 --> 14:39.857
has a psychic?

14:40.318 --> 14:42.160
And you didn't tell me?!

14:46.737 --> 14:50.657
- Come in.
- I've taken at least one tin from each case,

14:50.708 --> 14:53.748
incubating each individually
and examining for botulinum.

14:54.301 --> 14:55.792
Thank you, Miss Hart.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.849
I must say, your work
ethic is remarkable.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.600
Thank you, Detective.

15:01.308 --> 15:04.197
- And your results?
- Nothing.

15:04.663 --> 15:06.972
Every single can tested negative.

15:08.439 --> 15:11.210
Perhaps the tainted tin
was simply an aberration.

15:11.335 --> 15:13.875
But wasn't there one more tainted can?

15:14.168 --> 15:16.085
The one that was sent to the reporter.

15:17.387 --> 15:19.379
Miss Cherry!

15:20.202 --> 15:23.415
- Miss Cherry, a word.
- Detective! Hello.

15:23.443 --> 15:25.988
Is it about George Crabtree?
I hear he's likely dead.

15:26.113 --> 15:27.997
- He is not.
- Oh.

15:28.008 --> 15:30.381
There is no epidemic.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.892
- You think I made it up.
- Not exactly out of character.

15:34.347 --> 15:35.976
The Good Samaritan is real.

15:36.051 --> 15:39.787
He sent me a tin of Madison's beef
that was most certainly deadly.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.618
- Was it sealed?
- It was.

15:41.687 --> 15:43.713
I opened it and it proved lethal.

15:43.754 --> 15:46.069
There's a dead cat behind my house
if you'd like to see for yourself.

15:46.121 --> 15:49.755
That won't be necessary. But I
should like to examine the tin.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.303
Even though no one but
Mr. Gordon has fallen ill,

15:53.428 --> 15:57.209
- I think my caution was wise.
- Oh yes, very wise.

15:57.681 --> 16:00.956
- You're placating me.
- No, I'm not.

16:00.985 --> 16:04.180
I am not some silly child, you
are allowed to disagree with me.

16:04.305 --> 16:06.357
- But I don't.
- Stop it!

16:09.379 --> 16:11.256
Well, Detective...

16:11.273 --> 16:13.761
There is in fact botulinum in this tin.

16:13.801 --> 16:15.404
It appears your friend was right.

16:15.439 --> 16:17.238
Thank you, Miss Hart.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.997
- Only one other tin was poisoned?
- So it would seem.

16:21.122 --> 16:23.294
And none of the others
who consumed the meat

16:23.323 --> 16:25.735
the day of the photography
session have fallen ill.

16:25.758 --> 16:27.450
Well, then they're isolated incidents.

16:27.484 --> 16:29.708
It could be just one man
on the line being reckless.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.094
Or malicious.

16:32.724 --> 16:34.732
There's something odd about this tin.

16:35.064 --> 16:36.731
- How do you mean?
- I'm not quite sure.

16:36.782 --> 16:38.794
It just feels... off.

16:38.829 --> 16:40.034
Hold on...

16:41.834 --> 16:45.329
I swear there's something
different about it.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.426
I don't understand.

16:54.449 --> 16:58.161
- Did that company change cans at some point?
- No, never.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.558
All of our tins are the same,
across all of our products.

17:00.585 --> 17:02.529
Someone has taken a Madison's label

17:02.552 --> 17:04.325
and cut it down by a fraction of an inch

17:04.354 --> 17:06.586
and made it fit on a
different tin altogether.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.063
So it's some other meat?
What does all this mean?

17:11.942 --> 17:13.696
The photograph. Do you have it?

17:13.821 --> 17:16.271
There was a series of pictures taken...

17:22.394 --> 17:24.020
Here's a clear shot.

17:30.881 --> 17:32.020
There.

17:32.628 --> 17:35.166
The stripe at the top
of the can is missing.

17:35.438 --> 17:36.870
It's been tampered with.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.349
Ah!

17:40.920 --> 17:43.522
- So the poison isn't our product?
- No.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.124
This was a deliberate
attempt at sabotage.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.791
Someone set out to kill Mr. Gordon.

17:55.713 --> 17:59.425
So, the poisoning was
intentional. But to what end?

17:59.550 --> 18:02.654
Sir, you do have a handsome office.

18:03.308 --> 18:04.547
I'm sorry?

18:04.744 --> 18:05.993
Oh, well, it's just...

18:06.016 --> 18:09.235
Sir, since my recent brush
with mortality I've found

18:09.401 --> 18:11.441
a new appreciation for
the little things in life.

18:11.446 --> 18:15.479
Like your office for instance.
It's sophisticated yet...

18:15.513 --> 18:18.015
warm, yet officious.

18:18.308 --> 18:20.818
In fact I suppose the root of officious

18:20.852 --> 18:23.259
is office. Ha! Ha!

18:23.384 --> 18:25.171
The wonders of language.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.326
Yes. Well...

18:29.730 --> 18:31.923
We know that the killer
went to great lengths

18:31.950 --> 18:34.465
to disguise the poisoned
meat as Madison's.

18:34.479 --> 18:37.040
- Perhaps to disparage the brand.
- Indeed.

18:37.073 --> 18:40.946
And Mr. Madison did express some
concern over his competitors.

18:41.135 --> 18:43.355
Which could explain
why the "Good Samaritan"

18:43.364 --> 18:45.478
sent a second tin to the press.

18:45.496 --> 18:48.265
Well, perhaps the Good
Samaritan is our killer.

18:48.513 --> 18:50.789
George, find Miss Cherry
and see if she can recall

18:50.817 --> 18:54.137
- any more details about him.
- Sir, do I have to?

18:54.690 --> 18:56.808
- Yes.
- What, the reporter?

18:57.374 --> 18:58.734
She seems fine.

18:58.757 --> 19:01.069
She once called the Detective a bore.

19:02.455 --> 19:03.694
Huh...

19:05.411 --> 19:06.940
The least of her offenses.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.197
She once impersonated
a sequential killer

19:09.220 --> 19:11.504
- simply to sell more newspapers...
- I'll work with her.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.024
People are not to be defined
merely by their words,

19:14.033 --> 19:15.612
thoughts, and actions.

19:16.695 --> 19:19.285
What the... Are they not?

19:20.041 --> 19:22.956
Sir, I can't believe there are
so many types of canned meat.

19:22.977 --> 19:24.635
Do people really eat this stuff?

19:24.675 --> 19:28.808
Henry, you've only had access to
your fiancÃ©e's chef for a few weeks.

19:28.837 --> 19:31.741
Surely you've eaten
canned meat prior to that.

19:31.792 --> 19:34.196
Sir, I try not to think
about that time in my life.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.728
What we're looking for, Henry,

19:37.762 --> 19:40.488
is a can that matches
the size of this one.

19:40.525 --> 19:41.793
The Madison tin.

19:42.037 --> 19:43.649
Yes. But half-an-inch shorter

19:43.672 --> 19:46.403
because this isn't
actually a Madison's tin.

19:46.754 --> 19:48.200
It says it is...

19:49.034 --> 19:50.984
Let's just find a match.

19:51.706 --> 19:55.408
Now, there are plenty
that match the true size

19:55.460 --> 19:58.707
of the Madison's tins, but...

19:59.024 --> 20:00.981
Oh, wait.

20:02.887 --> 20:04.421
What does this mean?

20:05.782 --> 20:08.778
It means I need to have
a word with Mr. King.

20:14.465 --> 20:16.142
Right. Thank you all for coming.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.151
I've just been speaking with Mr. Madison

20:18.168 --> 20:19.955
and I have an important
announcement to make.

20:19.978 --> 20:21.917
What, are we gonna die again?

20:21.968 --> 20:24.712
- No, nobody's going to die.
- Well,

20:25.223 --> 20:26.669
except for Mr. Gordon, I suppose.

20:26.697 --> 20:28.281
- Oh non !
- Mon Dieu !

20:28.314 --> 20:31.658
- My dish has made me a murderer.
- Your dish is not the culprit.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.384
The contest is still going ahead,

20:33.421 --> 20:35.715
with a new judge, and
an even bigger prize.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.082
Whoever wins the contest now

20:38.979 --> 20:40.967
will become the new face of Madison's.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.470
How brilliant!

20:42.645 --> 20:44.920
So the poor man is at death's door

20:44.934 --> 20:47.513
and we're going to be
competing to be his replacement?

20:47.536 --> 20:48.945
Right. In any case,

20:48.977 --> 20:52.219
the competition will be going ahead
this afternoon at four o'clock.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.071
I hope to see you all there.

20:55.230 --> 20:58.109
Will you be re-entering in
the contest, Monsieur Prideaux?

20:58.621 --> 21:00.720
Fate beckons, madam.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.481
Whether I will answer
remains an uncertainty.

21:04.922 --> 21:06.483
I certainly hope you do.

21:06.608 --> 21:10.118
And I'm sure all those nasty
rumours are just nonsense.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.103
- Rumours?
- Hmm-mmm.

21:12.955 --> 21:15.175
- The Frenchman resigned?
- Hmm-mmm.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.842
People are saying whoever
poisoned Mr. Gordon

21:17.862 --> 21:20.497
is trying to kill all
the best chefs in Toronto.

21:20.665 --> 21:22.718
He was worried he might be next.

21:22.843 --> 21:24.750
Exactly which people are saying that?

21:24.796 --> 21:27.439
Oh... people. In any event,

21:27.476 --> 21:30.621
this means my path to
victory is now open.

21:30.746 --> 21:34.463
Imagine, the face of Madison's.

21:34.712 --> 21:36.880
- What, you?
- That's right, Thomas.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.391
You could be married to a celebrity.

21:40.492 --> 21:43.096
Of course, there's still George.

21:43.221 --> 21:45.188
He's my biggest competition now.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.290
If only he'd resign...

21:48.455 --> 21:49.936
But that's just silly!

21:49.952 --> 21:52.448
I'm gonna have to beat
him fair and square.

21:56.289 --> 22:00.669
We commissioned a slightly smaller
can to increase our margins.

22:01.043 --> 22:04.337
I hardly think it's a crime
worthy of a police investigation.

22:06.065 --> 22:10.255
So yours is the only food
cannery to use these smaller tins?

22:11.026 --> 22:12.500
As far as I know, yes.

22:13.438 --> 22:15.229
Well then, Mr. King,

22:15.257 --> 22:17.923
this must be one of yours.

22:31.671 --> 22:32.885
All right.

22:34.739 --> 22:39.131
So someone put a Madison's
label on my tin...

22:40.110 --> 22:41.503
- So what?
- Well, sir,

22:41.520 --> 22:44.624
this particular tin tested
positive for botulism.

22:45.452 --> 22:48.452
It was one of your cans
that poisoned Mr. Gordon.

22:50.547 --> 22:51.842
Dear God!

22:52.245 --> 22:54.116
But those cans were destroyed!

22:54.241 --> 22:56.172
I can assure you, Mr. King,

22:56.207 --> 22:58.729
not all of the tins in
question were destroyed.

22:58.763 --> 23:00.600
I oversaw it myself.

23:01.291 --> 23:03.571
Who first discovered this problem?

23:06.541 --> 23:09.673
My Vice President, Arthur Power.

23:10.416 --> 23:15.957
He happened to sample a tin
from that batch and fell ill.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.373
They paid me off.

23:21.183 --> 23:25.122
I can't work anymore. What
other option did I have?

23:25.156 --> 23:27.066
You promised to keep quiet.

23:27.728 --> 23:29.292
They said they fixed it.

23:29.327 --> 23:31.294
No one else was going to get hurt.

23:31.329 --> 23:34.965
Someone has, Mr. Power. Randall Gordon.

23:34.999 --> 23:38.468
Gordon? That's Madison's beef.

23:38.503 --> 23:41.302
He was poisoned by a can of Mr. King's

23:41.339 --> 23:43.317
disguised to look like Madison's.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.375
He tried to take them
both out in one go.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.646
- Who?
- King.

23:50.513 --> 23:53.316
He wanted Gordon to be his spokesman.

23:54.094 --> 23:56.040
But Madison stole him.

24:01.785 --> 24:04.957
I thought you said you could
contact him via post box.

24:05.746 --> 24:07.664
Well... I feel the fool.

24:07.698 --> 24:09.563
I should have checked
that the post box was real.

24:09.586 --> 24:11.935
I have a notion. Follow me.

24:15.436 --> 24:17.997
Sit down and close your eyes.

24:18.032 --> 24:19.920
- Why?
- For my notion.

24:20.045 --> 24:21.670
- What's your notion?
- You'll see.

24:21.716 --> 24:25.268
- Not if I close my eyes.
- By taking away your sight

24:25.297 --> 24:27.922
and focusing only on sound,
you will place your mind

24:27.934 --> 24:30.058
in the reality of that telephone call,

24:30.087 --> 24:34.524
and unearth a forgotten detail
that will lead us to his identity.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.155
That's stupid.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.923
If I'd heard something,
it would be in my notes.

24:41.974 --> 24:43.201
Nothing of interest...

24:43.326 --> 24:45.625
What about this? "I-N-D."

24:45.700 --> 24:49.073
- Indecipherable.
- Yes, but why was it indecipherable?

24:49.925 --> 24:51.520
There was a noise.

24:51.998 --> 24:54.211
Almost as if it were on top of him,

24:54.245 --> 24:59.294
- a loud grinding noise.
- Grinding? Like...

24:59.419 --> 25:03.888
No, more like...

25:07.592 --> 25:11.028
Yes.

25:11.067 --> 25:15.308
And there was another noise on
top of that. Sharp, metallic...

25:16.579 --> 25:18.635
Eeeeeeeee...

25:30.692 --> 25:32.462
A moleta.

25:37.629 --> 25:40.790
Crabtree! George...

25:42.364 --> 25:44.624
Margaret's winning that contest.

25:45.034 --> 25:46.833
And you're making sure of it.

25:48.985 --> 25:52.512
Sir, I... I have no control
over the other contestants.

25:52.526 --> 25:55.605
No. But you do have
control over one contestant.

25:55.944 --> 25:57.506
You.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.916
You mean...

26:00.327 --> 26:02.335
- Sir, I couldn't.
- Oh yes, you could.

26:02.364 --> 26:03.935
You can, and you will.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.930
Sir, if I don't try my best,

26:07.965 --> 26:09.928
I'll be impugning the whole spirit

26:09.940 --> 26:12.155
of the Madison's Fine
Beef Culinary Challenge.

26:17.258 --> 26:19.629
Let's just say it'll be
in your best interest.

26:20.827 --> 26:23.188
I couldn't take your money, sir.

26:23.527 --> 26:25.663
I'm not offering you any money, George.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.139
But the next time you ask
for a Saturday off work,

26:29.173 --> 26:31.373
you'll already know the answer.

26:31.498 --> 26:35.616
And it won't change for the
rest of your bloody life.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.918
- You're heading out?
- Oh!

26:42.208 --> 26:44.230
Yes. I need to speak with Mr. Gordon

26:44.246 --> 26:46.986
about who was at the
photograph opportunity.

26:47.015 --> 26:51.161
There may have been an agent
of Mr. King's Tinned Foods.

26:51.183 --> 26:54.108
Oh, good! I want to
check on his condition.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.444
I'll join you.

26:57.079 --> 26:59.468
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.518
Why wouldn't I be?

27:01.909 --> 27:03.567
No reason at all.

27:04.644 --> 27:07.595
Oh! I've purchased something for you.

27:07.720 --> 27:12.024
- Oh! What is it?
- Tobacco.

27:13.564 --> 27:15.977
You want me to take up smoking?

27:16.369 --> 27:19.520
- Well, only when you're feeling...
- Feeling what?

27:21.118 --> 27:23.794
I've read that for
women in your condition,

27:23.811 --> 27:26.863
it can have a calming
effect on emotions.

27:27.253 --> 27:29.020
Oh...

27:29.838 --> 27:31.503
Where did you get that tip,

27:31.537 --> 27:33.857
the New England Journal of Quacks?

27:34.300 --> 27:36.349
Nicotine is a stimulant, William.

27:37.047 --> 27:38.641
Or have you forgotten?

27:39.758 --> 27:42.612
I've also read that
you're not to quarrel

27:42.646 --> 27:44.041
in your state.

27:51.485 --> 27:54.124
Let's focus on work, shall we?

27:55.043 --> 27:56.926
Good idea.

28:06.131 --> 28:07.490
Mr. Gordon?

28:08.439 --> 28:10.006
He can't speak.

28:12.136 --> 28:13.696
Is there something you want to tell us?

28:13.711 --> 28:17.414
Mr. Gordon,

28:17.539 --> 28:20.583
if Mr. King was present, blink once.

28:23.045 --> 28:25.291
Do you know who did this?

28:28.089 --> 28:30.760
That's it! That's the sound I heard.

28:30.885 --> 28:32.787
He must have placed the
call somewhere around here...

28:32.792 --> 28:35.508
Unlikely. This is the
only moleta in Toronto,

28:35.539 --> 28:37.843
but he sets up in a
different location each day.

28:37.870 --> 28:40.437
The call came on Tuesday of last week.

28:49.067 --> 28:51.842
I'll read out the rows
by the first letter.

28:51.967 --> 28:54.145
When I read the right one, you blink

28:54.317 --> 28:58.958
Then I'll proceed along that
row and do the same. Yes?

28:59.879 --> 29:01.629
A-F...

29:01.664 --> 29:04.646
- K-P...
- Yes.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.007
- P
- Q...

29:08.132 --> 29:10.777
- R-S.
- Yes.

29:11.035 --> 29:13.396
- S.
- S.

29:14.007 --> 29:16.448
A-F...

29:16.573 --> 29:18.693
- V-W.
- Yes.

29:18.710 --> 29:21.865
- G-H-I...
- I.

29:22.418 --> 29:25.515
- S-W-I.
- Switch.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.434
Mr. Gordon, are you saying
you had a tin in your hand

29:28.486 --> 29:30.409
and it was switched that day?

29:32.947 --> 29:35.382
Who did this? Who was it?

29:35.739 --> 29:37.069
A...

29:37.092 --> 29:38.722
- Yes.
- A...

29:38.750 --> 29:42.251
B-C... C...

29:42.481 --> 29:45.981
- F... K...
- Yes.

29:46.056 --> 29:48.923
- M... N...
- N.

29:49.556 --> 29:51.641
C-O-N.

29:51.675 --> 29:52.827
Contestant?

29:53.852 --> 29:56.742
One of the contestants
switched your tin?

29:57.375 --> 29:58.982
But you don't know which one?

29:59.154 --> 30:02.595
Are you sure?

30:02.643 --> 30:05.107
If you didn't see it
occur, how can you be...

30:06.748 --> 30:08.435
Mr. Gordon?

30:08.676 --> 30:10.306
Mr. Gordon!

30:24.946 --> 30:26.754
Is everyone ready?

30:26.794 --> 30:28.843
We will begin henceforth.

30:29.189 --> 30:30.968
Fine work, Mr. Rhodes.

30:31.382 --> 30:34.272
I may well get out of all this
awfulness with my company intact.

30:34.336 --> 30:36.103
We only did what was right.

30:36.149 --> 30:37.773
The people saw that.

30:39.614 --> 30:41.370
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:41.399 --> 30:44.318
the competition will
commence shortly. But first,

30:44.336 --> 30:46.149
we will prove once and for all

30:46.161 --> 30:50.064
that Madison's Fine
Beef is entirely safe...

30:50.761 --> 30:52.281
Come.

30:52.494 --> 30:53.990
Madam, please.

30:55.251 --> 30:56.730
Watch you step.

30:57.133 --> 30:58.889
Even safe enough...

30:58.935 --> 31:00.668
for this baby!

31:11.423 --> 31:13.979
See, she loves it!

31:17.380 --> 31:19.906
OK. Very well.

31:24.492 --> 31:26.104
- George!
- Sir?

31:26.179 --> 31:29.772
Mr. Gordon believes that his
tin was intentionally switched

31:29.789 --> 31:32.919
- by one of the other contestants.
- I'm inclined to agree, sir.

31:32.953 --> 31:35.646
If I was you, sir, I
would speak to Lolo Tucker.

31:35.657 --> 31:38.518
She said Mr. Gordon
"got what he deserved".

31:38.759 --> 31:42.180
- Right. I'll speak with her.
- One other thing, sir.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.347
Do you think it's...

31:45.472 --> 31:47.932
ethical to let somebody win unfairly?

31:48.755 --> 31:52.477
George, I don't believe anyone
wins in a murder investigation.

31:52.506 --> 31:54.124
No, I don't mean the investigation, sir,

31:54.135 --> 31:57.319
I mean in general competition scenario.

31:57.636 --> 31:59.317
Something like this.

31:59.714 --> 32:02.801
Well, not this. But
let's say like this, yes.

32:03.549 --> 32:06.376
Well, I suppose if you were
to do it for your own gain,

32:06.405 --> 32:07.920
that would be wrong.

32:07.955 --> 32:10.999
But if it's a selfless act,

32:11.039 --> 32:12.663
then I see little harm.

32:19.203 --> 32:22.538
Mr. Gordon certainly
deserved what he got.

32:22.561 --> 32:25.030
God does the right thing
every once in a while.

32:25.155 --> 32:27.857
- Perhaps He had some help.
- Not from me.

32:28.087 --> 32:29.544
But if you...

32:29.669 --> 32:33.379
need to bring me in for
questioning, I won't object.

32:33.413 --> 32:36.487
- That won't be necessary, Mrs. Tucker.
- Oh.

32:36.527 --> 32:38.951
Then perhaps I can help you.

32:39.470 --> 32:41.287
I've heard a thing or two about

32:41.321 --> 32:43.954
little miss sunshine over there.

32:44.079 --> 32:46.269
Miss Cooper? What have you heard?

32:46.286 --> 32:49.729
That she is not "Miss Cooper" at all.

32:50.753 --> 32:52.094
Oh, that!

32:52.134 --> 32:53.781
I simply changed my name.

32:53.850 --> 32:56.545
My real name is Zagorskis. Latvian.

32:56.579 --> 32:58.386
It's too long for a poster.

32:58.427 --> 33:00.973
And I intend to be a star, Detective.

33:01.008 --> 33:04.276
You plan to pursue fame
through a cooking competition?

33:04.339 --> 33:06.625
Once you're famous you can do anything.

33:06.665 --> 33:08.911
No one minds how you got there.

33:13.551 --> 33:15.215
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:15.244 --> 33:17.598
the competition is about to begin!

33:24.087 --> 33:27.345
- Inspector! We found the moleta.
- The what?

33:27.373 --> 33:28.814
When the Good Samaritan called,

33:28.819 --> 33:30.795
there was a grinding
noise in the background.

33:30.830 --> 33:33.885
It was a knife-sharpener or a moleta.

33:34.410 --> 33:36.281
You're saying you know where
the man was calling from?

33:36.317 --> 33:38.684
Precisely. His location
on the day in question

33:38.707 --> 33:40.471
was right beside Madison's cannery.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.515
- The killer called from Madison's.
- He is likely an employee.

33:43.598 --> 33:46.345
And one of our suspects
works at their lunch counter.

33:49.673 --> 33:51.274
Good work!

33:54.774 --> 33:56.529
We know it was you, Douglas.

33:56.563 --> 33:58.170
We know the killer worked for Madison.

33:58.193 --> 34:00.381
I didn't kill anyone.
It was the Frenchman.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.317
Mr. Prideaux's dish
did not kill Mr. Gordon.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.183
What is your relation to Mr. King?

34:05.246 --> 34:08.101
- Do you work for him?
- King? I'd never work for him.

34:08.118 --> 34:09.540
That meat is disgusting.

34:09.603 --> 34:11.041
Aren't they the ones
who tried to pass off

34:11.063 --> 34:12.215
their bad batch as Madison's?

34:12.235 --> 34:14.489
We never told anyone about
King being the culprit.

34:14.522 --> 34:17.664
People knew. I was told
by a customer weeks ago.

34:17.742 --> 34:20.413
- About the fake tins?
- No, no, no, about the bad batch.

34:20.422 --> 34:23.163
- I just put two and two together.
- Who told you this?

34:23.936 --> 34:26.478
He did, him over there. Mr. Rhodes.

34:34.060 --> 34:35.819
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

34:36.681 --> 34:40.464
- Are you fiddling with my salt?
- No, I would never!

34:40.476 --> 34:42.542
It must have been someone else...

34:45.962 --> 34:48.754
Baking soda! You cheat!

34:48.879 --> 34:51.661
Mrs. Brackenreid, I was going
to do you a kindness this day.

34:51.696 --> 34:54.292
But now you can be sure
to see George Crabtree

34:54.310 --> 34:56.838
- at his culinary best!
- Contestants!

34:56.880 --> 34:58.787
Ready your pans!

34:58.851 --> 35:03.328
On your marks, get set, cook!

35:35.727 --> 35:37.205
Please, gentlemen.

35:37.330 --> 35:40.958
Mr. Powers, the man who
was poisoned by King's meat?

35:41.168 --> 35:42.759
He's an old friend of mine.

35:42.884 --> 35:45.385
I telephoned the reporter, nothing more.

35:45.993 --> 35:48.356
Why would you want to
destroy your own company?

35:49.006 --> 35:51.911
"The man who saved Madison's."

35:52.036 --> 35:54.366
Guiding the company through a crisis,

35:54.491 --> 35:58.488
taking responsibility, engendering
the good will of the public.

35:59.253 --> 36:01.998
They'll teach students
about me in business schools.

36:02.022 --> 36:04.826
I'm sure they'll include the fact
that you were hanged for murder.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.000
I don't think so.

36:07.023 --> 36:11.012
I put a few Madison
labels on some bad tins,

36:11.049 --> 36:13.292
I sent one to Miss Cherry.

36:13.310 --> 36:15.738
But I have no idea
who gave one to Gordon.

36:15.863 --> 36:18.069
I'm not sure anyone will believe that.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.390
But it's true, Detective.

36:20.791 --> 36:24.025
I wasn't even at the
photograph opportunity that day.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.552
It's true, sir. Mr. Rhodes wasn't there.

36:35.677 --> 36:36.740
You see?

36:36.966 --> 36:39.463
Now, I appreciate your
diligence, gentlemen,

36:39.490 --> 36:41.913
but I have a contest to judge.

36:43.589 --> 36:45.758
Maybe he switched the tin beforehand.

36:45.883 --> 36:48.973
Mr. Gordon was adamant that the
switch occurred at the scene.

36:49.001 --> 36:51.402
It had to be someone who was there...

36:51.454 --> 36:54.257
Three! Two! One!

36:54.280 --> 36:57.543
Spatulas down, hands off your pans!

36:57.577 --> 37:01.213
It's time to taste
these fine concoctions!

37:11.494 --> 37:13.726
He had to have been involved somehow.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.727
That second mislabelled
tin was no coincidence.

37:16.784 --> 37:19.537
Then we have to presume that
he was working with one of them.

37:19.980 --> 37:21.563
But why kill Gordon?

37:21.603 --> 37:24.804
Sending the tin to Miss Cherry
would have achieved the same result.

37:24.856 --> 37:27.193
An exposÃ© doesn't create
the same splash as a death.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.680
A warm hand for all our contestants!

37:29.974 --> 37:32.621
He had to have another
reason to kill Gordon.

37:40.308 --> 37:43.762
Oh no! It's truly horrible.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.728
Mmmm!

37:56.416 --> 37:59.205
Marvelous work, Constable!

37:59.239 --> 38:02.685
What a unique showcase
for our Fine Beef.

38:02.754 --> 38:04.579
Thank you, sir.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.695
Fabulous. Fabulous!

38:23.082 --> 38:26.496
Fine work, ma'am. Fine work!

38:26.514 --> 38:28.621
Thank you. Thank you.

38:28.746 --> 38:30.325
Thank you!

38:31.269 --> 38:33.923
A very difficult decision, indeed.

38:34.048 --> 38:37.504
But I can award victory only to one.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.589
Miss Kathleen Cooper!

38:43.714 --> 38:45.333
What?!

38:45.546 --> 38:47.532
- What?!
- This is nuts.

38:47.797 --> 38:49.317
No!

38:51.274 --> 38:54.118
I can't have lost. There's
no way that woman won!

38:54.135 --> 38:57.233
There's no benefit from
being a sore loser, Margaret.

38:57.267 --> 39:01.170
I'm telling you she CAN'T have won.

39:01.377 --> 39:03.674
I swapped out her salt.

39:03.731 --> 39:05.741
You what?! You swapped out her salt?!

39:05.781 --> 39:08.491
- I wanted to win! I deserved to win!
- Mr. Madison!

39:08.492 --> 39:11.163
Just a moment. Just a moment.

39:11.226 --> 39:14.358
Mr. Rhodes, perhaps you should taste

39:14.381 --> 39:16.176
this dish one more time.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.070
Why would I need to do that?

39:26.459 --> 39:29.129
Because it's utterly inedible!

39:30.102 --> 39:34.233
You wanted Miss Cooper to be the
new face of Madison's all along.

39:34.358 --> 39:37.005
So the two of you
conspired to kill Mr. Gordon

39:37.057 --> 39:39.305
and set your plan in
motion in the process.

39:39.486 --> 39:41.657
I didn't do anything!

39:41.703 --> 39:44.570
Look out!

39:44.593 --> 39:46.245
Wait!

39:47.282 --> 39:49.688
One question, Mr. Rhodes:

39:49.813 --> 39:51.490
why add murder to your plan?

39:51.513 --> 39:53.620
That part was her idea.

39:53.873 --> 39:56.689
Hmm. You were happy to go along with it.

39:57.926 --> 39:59.745
I wanted to be great,

40:00.494 --> 40:02.376
to be renowned,

40:02.802 --> 40:04.719
for the public to know my name.

40:05.122 --> 40:07.258
The public will know your name.

40:10.787 --> 40:13.551
I'm going to do it. I'm doing it!

40:25.947 --> 40:29.459
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my other to present to you,

40:29.487 --> 40:31.819
the new face of Madison's:

40:31.859 --> 40:34.761
Margaret Brackenreid!

40:34.778 --> 40:37.657
Thank you! Thank you so much.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.626
Yes!

40:42.682 --> 40:46.522
Come on, look at us!

40:46.556 --> 40:48.341
Fine work, Miss Cherry.

40:48.370 --> 40:51.272
- For that, you have my thanks.
- And your apology?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.645
- For what?
- For judging me unfairly.

40:58.830 --> 41:00.845
It may once again be safe,

41:00.897 --> 41:04.328
but I'm not sure I'll ever regard
meat with the same enthusiasm again.

41:04.453 --> 41:06.718
Perhaps you should stick
to freshly butchered cuts.

41:06.796 --> 41:08.380
I thought the same. Then I read up

41:08.392 --> 41:10.798
on the abattoir conditions
in the stockyards.

41:11.334 --> 41:14.137
The Shelleys subscribed
to a Pythagorean diet.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.934
- Da Vinci too.
- Pythagorean? You mean vegetarian?

41:16.963 --> 41:19.334
I do. "My body," said da Vinci,

41:19.355 --> 41:21.628
"will not be a tomb to other creatures."

41:22.019 --> 41:23.116
Yes.

41:23.175 --> 41:25.530
Yes, it's the only
way to live, isn't it?

41:27.386 --> 41:28.500
Join me, Miss Cherry.

41:28.519 --> 41:30.549
From this day forward,
we shall follow the ranks

41:30.567 --> 41:33.114
of all moral men in our strict adherence

41:33.188 --> 41:34.533
to vegetarianism.

41:34.561 --> 41:36.457
Uh, I don't think so.

41:36.476 --> 41:37.986
What are we, cows?

41:46.637 --> 41:49.237
William, are you going to
spend the next seven months

41:49.255 --> 41:53.884
- too afraid to speak?
- I... I was looking for the right thing to say.

41:55.344 --> 41:57.269
It seems I've become quite the burden

41:57.297 --> 42:00.590
now that pregnancy has made
me just a little emotional.

42:00.613 --> 42:02.410
Burden? No, not at all.

42:02.456 --> 42:04.569
It's just that I spend
a great deal of time

42:04.588 --> 42:06.956
trying to figure out
how best to help and I...

42:07.872 --> 42:09.586
I feel useless.

42:13.303 --> 42:14.753
I feel the same.

42:36.183 --> 42:37.505
Let me just say:

42:37.905 --> 42:39.511
Good choice, Crabtree.

42:40.052 --> 42:41.637
Sir, to be entirely honest,

42:41.671 --> 42:43.605
I didn't let Mrs. Brackenreid win.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.948
- Eh?
- I tried my best,

42:45.985 --> 42:47.620
she won fair and square.

42:47.942 --> 42:50.678
I suppose I'm not such a
terrific chef after all.

42:50.803 --> 42:52.272
Few men are.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.437
There's an idea, sir.

42:54.562 --> 42:57.210
What if bachelors like
myself didn't have to cook?

42:57.238 --> 43:00.300
What if you could just
purchase a prepared meal?

43:00.485 --> 43:02.414
- What for?
- For convenience.

43:02.446 --> 43:05.555
It would be ready to heat, ready to eat.

43:05.575 --> 43:07.685
That would be the slogan.
And I would call it...

43:08.598 --> 43:10.421
"Tasty Vittles Dinner."

43:10.614 --> 43:11.812
Bit of a mouthful.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.515
Well, I suppose I could
shorten it. "TV Dinner."

43:14.589 --> 43:16.685
And you could eat it
whenever you're watching

43:17.150 --> 43:19.507
whatever you can see out your
window, I suppose. I mean,

43:19.563 --> 43:22.626
the news of the day, some
copper solving a case,

43:22.649 --> 43:26.158
- perhaps a cooking competition.
- That sounds ridiculous.

43:26.983 --> 43:29.051
Why wouldn't you just
get yourself a wife?
