00:06.006 --> 00:09.509
I've just learned that President Rayburn,

00:09.509 --> 00:12.971
who had pledged his support
in a rather complex mission

00:12.971 --> 00:14.681
rescuing our men and women at sea,

00:14.681 --> 00:16.349
saw fit to revoke that promise.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.310
We are talking
to every intelligence service on the map.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.688
We're not talking to Iranian intelligence.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.399
You need to officially summon
the Iranian ambassador.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.317
- They have intel for us.
- Us?

00:26.317 --> 00:30.071
When you asked for help,
you did realize that I would then help?

00:30.071 --> 00:32.741
- Ambassador Hajjar, this is--
- I know who it is.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.286
- Nobody knows the ambassador's here.
- I was instructed to give you a name.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.706
An individual who appears
to have directed the attack.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.291
Ambassador, are you okay?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.209
Call his guy.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.377
You can't be here.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.755
It's the fucking Russians.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.340
The United Kingdom got attacked by Russia.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.426
- Why is that funny?
- Pour me another.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.888
- Oh. I'm a bloody idiot.
- No, it's fine.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.713
If we go to war with Russia,
we should get a dog.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.924
For protection?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.050
No.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.719
U.S. and the UK go to war with Russia?

01:34.719 --> 01:37.764
That's the kind of thing
where people have babies.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.226
'Cause it's apocalyptic.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.852
Babies are life-affirming.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.107
- Are you asking me to have a--?
- No.

01:48.107 --> 01:49.526
No.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.277
That's the whole point.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.488
We're a new thing.
We are not having a baby.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.573
But a dog?

01:56.741 --> 01:59.494
Are you asking me to move in with you?

01:59.494 --> 02:00.411
No.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.581
The dog can live half-time here,
half-time my place.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.129
I'm getting a fish.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.676
The president wants to come to Chevening.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.219
- What?
- It was Russia.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.304
They don't wanna
leave the planning to Ganon.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.931
No, no, no.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.517
The White House sees this
as an indirect hit on the U.S.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.562
If Rayburn comes, Trowbridge comes.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.940
The whole point is
that we hash out the Russia policy,

02:28.940 --> 02:30.441
secretary to secretary,

02:30.441 --> 02:32.944
and then we send it up the ladder,
fully baked.

02:33.945 --> 02:34.779
Hi, Lindsay.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.531
Can you put Karen on?

02:36.531 --> 02:37.448
Thanks.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.618
You're gonna be a nervous parent.
Even to a fish.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.744
Karen, hi.

02:41.744 --> 02:45.707
Listen, the president should not be
getting on a plane right now.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.293
We have Ganon and the foreign secretary,

02:48.293 --> 02:51.796
that's enough Level 1 targets
in one place at one time.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.131
It's not safe, right?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.424
We can make it safe.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.801
Will you fucking help me out?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.638
Guess who just popped in the office.
Hold on.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.641
Karen?

03:03.641 --> 03:05.310
Hi, it's Eidra Park.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.813
I know, I never see you anymore.
How are you?

03:08.813 --> 03:09.814
Seriously?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.985
Kar, this stays in the vault,

03:13.985 --> 03:17.572
but you know the Iranian ambassador
who died here yesterday?

03:18.197 --> 03:19.741
Tox screen isn't back yet.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.535
Which means we can't rule out poisoning.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.538
No, the foreign secretary
didn't poison him,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.374
but the Russians could have
before he even got to the office.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.584
Wait, really?

03:30.668 --> 03:33.630
I'm just saying
that until we know what's going on,

03:33.630 --> 03:36.758
I think I'd feel better
if the president was in D.C.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.929
Yes.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.477
Hmm.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.110
Did you tell them to do this?

03:56.945 --> 03:57.779
What?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.531
- They packed me.
- Yeah, of course they did.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.033
They--

04:03.159 --> 04:04.702
They packed me tampons.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.912
They think ahead.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.333
Eight supers, four lights, and Advil.

04:10.333 --> 04:14.003
They know where I am
on my fucking moon cycle.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.553
Russia doesn't wanna go to war with us
and the Brits, right?

04:24.138 --> 04:25.974
I have no idea what they want.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.810
They framed Iran.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.728
Did they want us to go to war with Iran?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.189
They're tricky.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.778
I don't love people touching my stuff,

04:38.778 --> 04:40.530
but they do a very nice job.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.532
And so it begins.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.449
What?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.410
You're gonna get used to this.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.828
No, I am not.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.162
Well...

04:48.162 --> 04:51.666
They should pack you while we're gone.
Then you'll just be ready to go.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.043
Look at that. You think ahead too.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.006
What?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.007
Nothing.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.180
Is there a talk we're supposed to have?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.017
No.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.685
- Shit.
- No.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.734
Thank you for fucking me.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.819
No, I don't think it changes

05:19.819 --> 05:22.780
the fundamental non-viability
of our marriage.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.616
At no point did I think it did, okay?

05:25.616 --> 05:26.576
It was selfish.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.662
Well, if that's what selfish looks like...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.999
- You don't have to come to this thing.
- Get over yourself.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.916
We're done.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.420
I'm arm candy
for the first tranche of photo ops,

05:37.420 --> 05:39.172
then I drift off as planned.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.800
Doesn't mean you can't come back
to the trough every now and then.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.636
I just...

05:46.512 --> 05:48.890
I don't want things to be unclear.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.308
Katherine...

05:51.184 --> 05:54.270
only you can ruin
a perfectly good, wordless roll

05:54.270 --> 05:56.272
in the ashes of a dead union.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.067
Okay.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.193
Good.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.298
It's the foreign secretary's
fucking country bunker.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.550
We don't need
another sweep of the property,

06:24.550 --> 06:27.011
we need to get
the ambassador there on time.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.388
Mr. McNabb says
we can't ignore the possibility

06:29.388 --> 06:31.015
of a threat from inside the house.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.351
Is he worried about Dennison?

06:34.852 --> 06:37.730
You tell him if he is worried
about the foreign secretary,

06:37.730 --> 06:39.857
he is way over the fucking line.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.859
We don't frisk our allies.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.903
He says the foreign secretary is our ally.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.404
That is not what I said.

06:46.989 --> 06:50.201
Mr. McNabb reiterates the ambassador's
safety is his area of expertise.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.202
I know that.

06:51.202 --> 06:55.123
He also wishes to remind you the last time
the foreign secretary met with a diplomat,

06:55.123 --> 06:57.500
- that diplomat wound up in a body bag.
- Just tell--

06:57.500 --> 07:00.795
Until we get the chemical tests
back, we'll proceed with every caution.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.255
Give me the phone.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.635
Bert, this is utter bullshit.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.470
Bert?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.224
- I'm calling State.
- Outside.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.239
Dennison was there.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.783
Officially, I was too, at the very end.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.495
So until they find out if it was Novichok
or high blood pressure,

07:34.495 --> 07:36.330
they have every right to be concerned.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.915
Okay. I'm just...

07:37.915 --> 07:38.833
Anxious.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.668
Not at all.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
I'm okay at this part.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
I suck at a garden party.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.048
But real negotiations?

07:46.048 --> 07:49.135
I know. I am completely
confident in your ability--

07:49.135 --> 07:50.219
Really?

07:50.219 --> 07:51.137
Yes.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.555
I don't think you are.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.558
Did you read the agenda?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.601
Of course I did.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.065
It's really long.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.526
I would never give an ambassador
a briefing book

08:05.526 --> 08:07.570
without a one-pager in the front.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.071
It doesn't get read.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.948
- Short enough?
- Better.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.618
- This is tomorrow's agenda.
- Okay.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.412
- The day will consist of three parts.
- Mm-hm.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.582
Today you will strategize
with the British delegation

08:19.582 --> 08:22.084
how to maximize those three parts

08:22.084 --> 08:24.670
so we can make the most
of the foreign secretary's time

08:24.670 --> 08:26.130
with the secretary of state

08:26.130 --> 08:28.049
and walk out with a Russia strategy.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.384
Why don't you just give me the card?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.762
- Can we talk through it?
- Let me see what it says.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.847
It's notes from me to me. It won't help.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.848
Let me see.

08:35.848 --> 08:36.807
Okay.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.144
-"Hug, Pivot, Bear."
- Mm-hm.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.189
You're right.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.650
Number one.

08:46.317 --> 08:50.196
A public demonstration
of the strong U.S.-UK relationship.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.615
So that Russia knows
we are still a united front,

08:52.615 --> 08:55.076
same as we were
when they first invaded Ukraine.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.619
Is that the hug?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.162
- It is.
- It's cute.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.830
- Number two--
- Hey.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.416
What's the holdup?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.168
Security sweep.

09:04.835 --> 09:08.381
They think Dennison's gonna kill you
the way he killed the Iranian ambassador?

09:08.381 --> 09:11.842
I think, even in jest,
that we should avoid suggesting

09:11.842 --> 09:15.429
that the Iranian ambassador's death
had anything to do with our closest ally.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.931
- Or the Russians.
- Don't do that.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.016
- He's already wound up.
- I'm really not.

09:19.016 --> 09:22.186
Wouldn't be the first time the Russians
poisoned someone on British soil.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.646
- I'd love to keep going.
- Please do.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.065
- Wouldn't even be the second time.
- Number two on the agenda.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.733
- Yes.
- What's number one?

09:27.733 --> 09:28.734
Hugging.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.903
- A pivot away from Iran.
- Pivot.

09:30.903 --> 09:31.821
Yes.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.282
- Now that we know it was Russia--
- Ah. The poison?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.325
They treating you as a suspect?
They should.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.661
- Get back in the car.
- Gotta piss.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.622
Are they?

09:41.622 --> 09:43.082
Treating me like a suspect?

09:43.082 --> 09:45.126
No. A witness.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.212
Eidra may need to talk to you later today.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.255
And Met Police.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.549
- Okay. Number two. Pivot.
- Yes.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.468
Now that we know it was Russia,
we need to pivot from Iran.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.012
You mean apologize.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.013
I don't.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.015
State was particular about that.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.893
We can't say sorry to a regime
that chants "Death to America."

10:02.893 --> 10:04.020
Ma'am?

10:04.020 --> 10:04.937
Clear.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.648
Get in the other car.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.900
You want Hal and I
arriving in the same vehicle.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.194
But I'd love to finish the agenda.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.571
- Three is "Bear."
Yeah.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.031
- Which is Russia.
Yes.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.157
It was a gimme.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.116
Hal!

10:17.116 --> 10:19.118
It takes as long as it takes.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.656
Thank you.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.699
Welcome.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.578
Honored to have you here.
Hoope. I cover Iran.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.871
Nice to meet you.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.706
Russia. Kemper-Waithe.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.168
Nice to meet you.
- I understand we owe you our thanks.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.005
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
I thought you would've started.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.799
Nonsense. You're right on time.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.634
Nice bit of country you got.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.720
A thrill to meet you as well, sir.
How proud you must be.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.431
Of my wife? I am.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.683
Kemper-Waithe. Russia.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.769
Hayford. The whole world.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.732
- Shall we?
- Yes.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
What the fuck is going on?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.573
I missed those dulcet tones.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.118
Your Iran guy keeps smiling at me.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.704
You're the woman of the hour.
You put out the conflagration in the Gulf.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.040
They know what happened?

11:48.040 --> 11:51.836
They have no idea what happened.
They know you had something to do with it.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.172
You said it wasn't Iran from the get-go.
Turns out you were right.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.757
You don't get any credit?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.676
We're a formidable team.

11:59.301 --> 12:03.013
But the consensus is
you're the dogcatcher.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.306
What does that mean?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.893
That means you leashed the dogs of war.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.020
I like it.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.648
I think it suits you.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.400
I kind of think it does.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.653
Welcome.
Welcome to our modest monstrosity.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.448
The indispensable Cecilia Dennison.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.909
Of course. Of course.
It's very nice to meet you.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.619
Ambassador Katherine Wyler.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.705
Was he terribly upset?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.124
Was...? Excuse me?

12:30.124 --> 12:32.793
Austin. Was he a prig about it?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.295
About...?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.172
Well, you were tardy.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.132
He makes a fuss when I'm late.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.092
It's double standards.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.094
Can we not do that?

12:42.094 --> 12:44.096
I agree. Let's not stand here.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.139
- Come in.
- Yes.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.349
It's not home but it's much.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.144
Thank you.
I mean, it's very nice to meet you.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.900
You must be the wife.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.360
What gave it away?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.571
Come on. I'll give you the grand tour.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.573
- Okay.
- So sorry to interrupt.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.909
You're needed on the secure line.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.619
I'll be there in a minute.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.371
It's the prime minister.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.249
Excuse me.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.334
Yeah. Mm-hm.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.048
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.596
Apologies.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.722
Anu.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.016
After the secretary of state arrives,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.895
we'll start with a mutual acknowledgment
about the sharp words

13:32.895 --> 13:35.689
regarding President Rayburn
from Prime Minister Trowbridge

13:35.689 --> 13:38.901
were simply a spirited debate
among friends.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.820
Then we'll move onto item two, Iran--

13:41.820 --> 13:43.239
Ambassador. Thank you.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.741
Ah, comments with the placement of Iran
on the agenda?

13:45.741 --> 13:47.993
No. It's not Iran. I was just...

13:48.994 --> 13:50.162
I'm fine.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.207
- Three.
- She's not fine.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.751
- Three.
This is exactly

13:55.751 --> 13:57.836
what we were told by Mrs. Wells.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.256
A woman, slender, like yourself--

14:00.256 --> 14:02.258
- I think we should move on.
We shouldn't.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.135
It's structural inequity
in the plainest sense.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.555
Chairs designed for a man's build.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.723
If we want women at the table,

14:09.723 --> 14:13.310
it is incumbent upon us
to pull up a suitable chair.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.814
Can we get Ambassador Wyler
a suitable chair?

14:16.814 --> 14:19.483
- Can I get you a chair?
- I love my chair.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.986
I'm really curious
about agenda item three.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.153
Perhaps a cushion?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.365
- Perfect. Thank you.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.704
Okay--

14:37.293 --> 14:38.544
Thank you.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.461
So to review,

14:39.461 --> 14:43.674
one, a demonstration of the strong,
healthy U.S.-UK relationship,

14:43.674 --> 14:46.343
two, Iran, and three, Russia.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.846
Thank you, Anu.

14:48.846 --> 14:54.226
If we could move one to three,
and if there are no other changes,

14:54.226 --> 14:57.146
then I think we can continue.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.063
Of course.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.231
Why?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.320
Why are we moving one to three?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.073
Between your late arrival

15:08.073 --> 15:10.367
and the structural inequity
of the furniture,

15:10.367 --> 15:12.453
we're running behind schedule.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.749
Item one might warrant
a longer discussion.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.004
- Anu.
- Our new item one: Iran.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.341
Uh, if we can all turn to page four.
Thank you.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.259
Page number four.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.805
I can do the tour. Got it memorized.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.099
Especially your bit about Lord Earlsby.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.351
Wellsby.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.936
Mm. Not in my version.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.646
It's no problem, madam.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.230
He doesn't trust me.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.774
She seems competent.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.151
Perhaps the list?

15:44.151 --> 15:45.945
You're right, it's wise.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.448
They keep a list of activities I can do.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.866
It's terribly dull,

15:50.866 --> 15:53.619
but I find if I do two at once,
they spring to life.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.331
Tour of the grounds is thing one.
You get to pick thing two.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.252
Hmm. Forehead Detective.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.379
Excellent.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.006
We need to exonerate Iran,

16:06.006 --> 16:09.593
publicly, vocally,
and as soon as possible.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.179
So when we are ready to accuse Russia,

16:12.179 --> 16:14.556
we've laid the groundwork
for a new narrative...

16:14.556 --> 16:17.559
State's position on an apology is no.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.061
He didn't say "apology."

16:19.061 --> 16:21.647
Is an Iranian acquittal wise, do we think?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.940
They're hardly nuns.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.610
If Russia's aim was to ensnare us
in a war in the Gulf,

16:26.610 --> 16:30.948
then anything other than an acquittal
would be a gift to the Kremlin.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.284
Until we make it clear
that Iran is not the culprit,

16:34.284 --> 16:37.830
the rest of the world will believe
Ambassador Hajjar's demise--

16:37.830 --> 16:39.206
In your office.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.042
An apology. To Iran.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.877
- Nope.
- A shell game.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.130
Russia for Iran.

16:46.130 --> 16:50.009
Either way, we can't acquit Iran
till we're ready to name Russia.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.594
Meanwhile, what exactly do we tell Iran?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.471
We can offer other concessions.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.889
Just don't offer tea.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.142
She's right, you know.

16:58.892 --> 16:59.727
I was kidding.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.353
Or coffee, I'd say.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.022
Oh, my God.

17:03.022 --> 17:03.939
Sorry?

17:03.939 --> 17:07.151
You're indulging
hardline Iranian conspiracy theories

17:07.151 --> 17:10.779
and acting like we snuck Hajjar's body
out in a suitcase.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.741
The CIA didn't kill Kennedy,

17:13.741 --> 17:15.617
Q is not the Internet messiah,

17:15.617 --> 17:17.619
and the tea was not poisoned.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.875
I was told the chemical testing
is not yet complete.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.794
If he was poisoned, it wasn't the tea.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.672
He didn't even drink it
until after his symptoms began.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.508
Austin?

17:31.508 --> 17:32.426
Water.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.679
I think we're due for a break.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.265
Okay. Break.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.021
Do you know what you just said?

17:44.021 --> 17:46.356
Did I say you were kind of snippy?
'Cause you are.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.568
You said his symptoms began
before he drank the tea.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.486
Yeah.

17:52.112 --> 17:56.450
The CIA may not have killed Kennedy
but they did sneak you into my office,

17:56.450 --> 17:59.661
shortly after which
the Iranian ambassador left on a gurney.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.121
- Shit.
- You're not supposed to know

18:01.121 --> 18:03.916
when the symptoms began because
you shouldn't have been in the room.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.210
I'm sorry.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.420
It's bad enough

18:08.420 --> 18:10.464
- half the world thinks I killed Hajjar.
- I know.

18:10.464 --> 18:14.218
It's best to have not done it
in concert with the great Satan.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.015
What?

18:20.599 --> 18:21.517
Your...

18:23.018 --> 18:25.145
Your shirt. I think you missed a button.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.149
Damn it.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.029
No.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.825
Thank you.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.789
We can say you told me about the tea.
If anyone asks.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.290
Which I doubt they will.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.546
What's the longer discussion?

18:50.546 --> 18:53.715
Item three, formerly known as item one.
We call it the Hug.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.635
Oh, they'll notice that we're gone.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.346
I think a statement will do the trick.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.389
You love us,

19:00.389 --> 19:03.267
Trowbridge won't call the president
a douchebag again.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.726
As a token of your contrition,

19:04.726 --> 19:06.770
you're declaring it "tomato,"
not "tomahto."

19:06.770 --> 19:09.064
He will not hug.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.608
He wants to end it.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.693
End what?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.529
The entanglement of our two nations.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.700
The assumption
that American might makes right.

19:19.700 --> 19:25.372
That the British military cannot act
without American assistance or approval.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.916
That we suffer the whims
of your elected officials

19:27.916 --> 19:31.587
and are bludgeoned
by your unflagging self-interest.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.049
It might be dangerous
to be America's enemy,

19:36.049 --> 19:39.094
but to be its friend is fatal.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.057
Are you out of your fucking mind?

19:44.057 --> 19:45.309
Please keep your voice--

19:45.309 --> 19:47.019
You're breaking up with us?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.354
- The prime minister--
- You ditched the EU.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.773
Scotland and Northern Ireland want out.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.735
Russia just spent a year
murdering Ukrainians,

19:54.735 --> 19:57.404
now they're turning
their attention to you.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.365
This is when
you wanna rethink the alliance?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.534
You're right, it's a longer discussion.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.078
Let's gin up a non-apology apology

20:05.078 --> 20:08.498
to a nearly nuclear
anti-Western theocracy.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.001
Turns out it's less loaded than the Hug.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.130
Not an apology.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.466
It's beyond the realm of the possible.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.301
- Alistair.
- Beyond the realm.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.761
All right.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.348
I can also think of a few things
they would prefer to an apology.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.307
Such as?

20:25.307 --> 20:27.142
Striking their Revolutionary Guard

20:27.142 --> 20:29.603
from the Foreign Terrorist
Organizations list.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.104
That's not the point.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.358
I think Iran would consider it
directly to the point.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.904
Ambassador Wyler,
we are no longer an empire.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.739
We're not even part of a continent.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.701
We're a small island nation
with a great democracy.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.663
We called Iran the enemy
and they were not,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.373
so now we say something. We apologize.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.250
Even if America prefer we not,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.962
because when the rest of the world
stop believing our word,

20:54.962 --> 20:56.421
our might goes with it.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.006
What exactly's going on?

21:07.516 --> 21:08.850
Some happy tidings.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.271
The prime minister has found himself
in the neighborhood

21:12.271 --> 21:14.439
and is dropping by to say hello.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.423
Prime Minister, what an honor.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.966
The road opened up before me

21:40.966 --> 21:44.678
and I'm afraid it was as if
the whole county of Kent was lying back

21:44.678 --> 21:49.141
and opening her well-bred legs
to be ravished by this beast of an engine.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.852
So I find myself here.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.608
It's quite the car.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.322
It's a loan from a friend.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.240
He's got one of those names
you can't pronounce,

22:05.240 --> 22:07.075
so I thought I'd take it for a spin

22:07.075 --> 22:09.828
before the ethics Nazis
spoil the whole thing.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.209
Good God.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.378
Sniff.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.838
Go on. Everyone.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.799
Tell me, what do you smell?

22:22.799 --> 22:24.009
Julian.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.179
- Nothing in particular?
- Nothing in particular. Yeah.

22:27.971 --> 22:31.892
Whereas Chequers,
which is my grace-and-favor retreat,

22:31.892 --> 22:33.101
has a certain pong.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.936
Lydia won't shut up about it.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.731
It's your office all over again.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.525
I'm the one they elected.
Why do you get all the good toys?

22:41.943 --> 22:44.571
Good to see you, sir.
Good to be seen.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.622
I hear the Great Ganon's a drunk,

22:53.622 --> 22:56.625
so cocktails should come
early and often tomorrow.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.753
You're discussing Russia,
so vodka, clearly, to set the tone.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.922
That's my two cents' worth.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.632
What have you come up with?

23:04.341 --> 23:06.009
Well, we've just begun.

23:07.094 --> 23:11.515
You might prefer a full briefing
after the meeting.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.600
No, I don't prefer. I want it now.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.022
Well, we've finalized the agenda
for tomorrow.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.524
First, Iran.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.775
- Some sort of--
- Pivot.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.193
No. First, Russia.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.574
Big country. Butchered Ukraine.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.535
Blasted our aircraft carrier to bits.

23:33.161 --> 23:36.373
We've not broached
the Russia question just yet.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.336
It's interesting.

23:42.921 --> 23:47.509
I'm being wallpapered by the press
for a certain lack of action.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.470
<i>The Times</i> is calling for a snap election.

23:51.638 --> 23:55.642
Ganon is coming tomorrow
to stand shoulder to shoulder with us,

23:55.642 --> 23:58.728
presumably while we say something
to the world about what happened,

23:58.728 --> 24:02.482
and meanwhile, you haven't
broached the Russia question yet.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.903
Ambassador Wyler, you're clever.
Does that scan for you?

24:08.196 --> 24:09.906
No one's forgotten about Russia.

24:09.906 --> 24:14.744
I'm just merely wondering if there's an
agenda to my foreign secretary's agenda.

24:15.954 --> 24:16.872
Of course not.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.206
I asked the ambassador.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.794
Madam Ambassador, did Iran hit our ship?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.421
No.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.006
So why are we talking about them?

24:26.673 --> 24:30.051
With respect, if Russia framed Iran...

24:30.051 --> 24:31.386
It's always "if."

24:31.386 --> 24:36.558
...you can turn Iran from one of Russia's
only friends to a sworn enemy.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.395
He's setting you up
to be a great statesman.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.481
"To be." Someday.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.361
Meanwhile, I've got 41 widows

24:48.361 --> 24:51.281
wishing that they had
your Second Amendment rights today,

24:51.281 --> 24:52.782
not someday.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.496
The Russians blew up our fucking warship.

24:58.496 --> 25:01.833
Perhaps we should stop wetting the bed
and seize tomorrow, if not today,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.210
to say who's done it.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.504
- Sir, if you would just give us a chance--
- Perhaps you're right.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.009
Well, look at that.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.636
Thank you, Austin.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.764
No, thank you.
This has been really helpful.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.558
Oh, I'm not leaving.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.228
Sleeves up.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.479
Let's muck in.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.194
Am I a man?

25:29.194 --> 25:32.447
Mm... Partly, at best.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.200
Let's say it's subjective.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.577
Trees. Pond.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.828
Am I alive?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.206
From the waist down, maybe.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.582
Do I know me?

25:42.582 --> 25:44.709
Oh, well, I hope not.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.672
Although you'll say you do
if you ever run for higher office.

25:50.590 --> 25:51.466
Will you?

25:52.676 --> 25:53.551
Say I know me?

25:53.551 --> 25:55.178
No. Run for something.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.013
Escape the purgatory.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.848
I'm enjoying the break.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.059
Well, that's bollocks.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.938
- Why, do I know me?
- No.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.732
Maybe. No.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.650
Careful.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.776
I know everyone.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.152
He'd love you.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.029
He. That's interesting.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.908
Ah, the Great Temple.
There's another one around the corner

26:16.908 --> 26:19.703
called something like
the Slightly Less Great Temple.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.787
Temple.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.414
I'm not...

26:24.833 --> 26:25.875
Am I God?

26:27.085 --> 26:28.295
What a thing to say.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.379
Not no.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.423
Am I Jesus?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.174
Ah! Ding, ding, ding.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.468
- And I'm...
- Absolutely not.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.678
Austin!

26:37.178 --> 26:39.472
Hey! You're a conniving little cheat.

26:39.472 --> 26:43.059
No, I'm not. I'm Henry fucking Kissinger.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.938
"Perhaps you're right"?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.607
Do you understand
what we're talking about here?

26:49.607 --> 26:52.235
Accusing Russia
of attacking a British warship.

26:52.235 --> 26:55.280
Tomorrow,
with the U.S. secretary of state.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.490
We're talking about it, that is all.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.409
The meeting will now
become a Russia briefing.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.912
After which, if there is a God,
the prime minister will leave.

27:02.912 --> 27:07.417
I really think we need to tell him
we're not ready for a Russia accusation.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.712
I need you to follow my lead.
Is there any way you might do that?

27:11.963 --> 27:13.506
You're asking for my help?

27:14.632 --> 27:16.384
- I am.
- Because I have a lot going on.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.511
I have to tell Ganon
he's about to be ambushed

27:18.511 --> 27:21.765
with a request that our two nations
start seeing other people.

27:21.765 --> 27:25.352
At times, I have to serve
as the prime minister's voice box.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.313
But I, as me, am asking you, as you,

27:29.064 --> 27:30.023
for your help.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.033
How can I be of service?

27:41.910 --> 27:45.622
He needs a brisk, chatty briefing
on Russia strategy.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.582
Something that makes him feel--

27:47.582 --> 27:49.167
Smart and in control?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.920
- I suppose, yeah.
- He's not a unicorn.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.846
In an unexpected
change to today's schedule,

28:01.846 --> 28:04.641
our agenda now reads thus:

28:05.225 --> 28:07.727
One, Russia.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.145
Two,

28:10.188 --> 28:11.147
Russia.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.233
Three-- Julian?

28:13.233 --> 28:14.484
Russia?

28:15.235 --> 28:16.361
Fast learner.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.363
But it isn't, officially.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.949
Isn't what?

28:20.949 --> 28:22.242
Russia.

28:22.951 --> 28:23.868
Not officially.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.913
I can't fucking believe this.

28:28.581 --> 28:33.294
I thought that the Indians
had tracked the guy

28:33.294 --> 28:35.296
who blew up the boat and shot the shot.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.297
They did.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.883
And after which, Romanian intelligence,

28:38.883 --> 28:41.970
in one of the great triumphs
of mice over men,

28:41.970 --> 28:45.014
- espied him fleeing to Russia...
- Sir, the complicating--

28:45.014 --> 28:48.226
...where he was paid by... What's it?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.811
- Lenkov.
- Who is Russian!

28:49.811 --> 28:50.979
Why is this hard?

28:52.522 --> 28:56.359
You're foreign policy advisors,
armed with the entire Cold War playbook.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.987
You're not flat-earthers
looking for the edge.

29:00.905 --> 29:05.118
Sir, we can't blithely
lob accusations at Russia.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.704
They're a nuclear power
run by an individual

29:07.704 --> 29:12.333
who will happily level sovereign nations
even without provocation.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.254
We call it genocide.
Russia calls it a job well done.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.381
- Okay. Then accuse Lenin.
- Lenkov.

29:18.381 --> 29:22.260
Whoever the fuck he is,
charge him with the slaughter of 41 men!

29:22.260 --> 29:23.553
And women.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.973
Lenkov is a fig leaf for the Kremlin.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.727
The moment we accuse
either Russia or Lenkov

29:30.727 --> 29:34.397
of a direct attack on the United Kingdom,
a NATO ally,

29:34.397 --> 29:36.691
they will preempt our response.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.277
Unable to match us
in conventional warfare,

29:39.277 --> 29:42.363
they may break the seal
of the last remaining taboo:

29:42.363 --> 29:43.990
nuclear weapons.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.159
Tactical warheads, to start,

29:46.159 --> 29:49.120
as if they're somehow less significant,
which they aren't.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.830
He's driving off a cliff here.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.792
And if we follow your bluster
through to its natural end--

29:53.792 --> 29:57.337
- Sorry. My fucking what?
- Sir, I think you're missing the point.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.005
Am I?

30:00.006 --> 30:03.426
The prime minister is well aware
we can't accuse Russia

30:03.426 --> 30:06.012
until we know how we're going to respond.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.056
It would be insane.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.726
But he's looking further down the road
while we're still worried about evidence.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.146
The secretary of state is on his way.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.191
And while we may not need
the prime minister's help

30:18.191 --> 30:20.568
crafting an accusation,

30:20.568 --> 30:24.572
we clearly need his help
in crafting a response.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.204
Ah. Out of the mouths of babes.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.164
I'll make some calls. When I get back,

30:33.164 --> 30:36.584
you're gonna provide me
with some options for a response.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.838
You have 20 minutes.

30:50.139 --> 30:53.852
Who is the Russia guy from the NDI
you worked with in Tallinn?

30:55.186 --> 30:56.145
Schulman?

30:57.272 --> 31:00.066
My morning was delightful,
thank you for asking.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.526
I have 20 minutes to generate

31:01.526 --> 31:04.153
a British-led,
bilateral response to Russia.

31:04.153 --> 31:07.073
- Who was the guy?
- I got a tour of the grounds.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.118
- Turns out she's the sister, not the wife.
- What?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.245
Cecilia Dennison.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.248
Is his sister?

31:15.248 --> 31:16.875
Curveball.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.714
Who brings their sister?

31:22.714 --> 31:26.759
She got dumped
by some vaguely royal asshole.

31:26.759 --> 31:30.805
And Dennison took her lame suicide attempt
way too seriously.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.975
- Oh, shit.
- Now he won't let her out of his sight.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.227
She loves her brother.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.647
Says he can be a bit of a prig
but he has a good heart.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.609
That his wife died a couple of years ago,

31:42.609 --> 31:45.403
and he desperately needs to get laid.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.614
- Jesus.
- Look...

31:50.491 --> 31:53.912
If I'm leaving, you'll need
a little something on the side,

31:53.912 --> 31:57.332
or you'll get surly,
which is bad for America.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.249
Hal.

31:58.249 --> 32:03.755
He is the platonic ideal of all
those fucking handsome, repressed nerds

32:03.755 --> 32:05.131
you dated before you met me.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.216
Don't pretend you didn't notice.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.845
The Russia guy?
With the frozen toilets in Tallinn?

32:12.096 --> 32:12.931
Shellman?

32:13.723 --> 32:15.892
I mean it. You should tap that.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.481
He had an idea about
how to sanction the cobalt oligarch

32:21.481 --> 32:23.733
without tanking the world's cobalt supply.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.276
Yeah.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.446
What's his fucking name?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.199
I don't remember.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.167
Gellman. Gellman!

32:45.129 --> 32:46.381
Ben Gellman.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.636
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- No.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.971
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.181
You were shouting.
- Ben Gellman, from the NDI,

32:55.181 --> 32:58.810
I need to call him,
and I need to get financials,

32:58.810 --> 33:02.897
vice chairman of Gazprom,
and I'm gonna... figure that out.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.367
Hi. You know I work for you, right?

33:14.367 --> 33:15.910
- Yeah.
As does Ronnie.

33:15.910 --> 33:16.828
Thrilled.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.206
You were a DCM, but you're not anymore.

33:20.206 --> 33:23.584
So if you need to figure stuff out,
I am a resource.

33:23.584 --> 33:27.255
As is Ronnie, as are the 800
other folks that work for you.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.843
- By the time I explain it--
- Ma'am, I think you should try.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.138
I think that we are doing
the part of the job you like,

33:35.138 --> 33:37.807
you're great at it, but it is a big job.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.142
So is mine.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.560
You can't handle both.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.311
I've got Ben Gellman.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.569
You can come in.

33:50.319 --> 33:54.949
You, I need 17 plausible
diplomatic retaliations to Russia.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.744
I have two in place. Spitballing for more.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.873
Is that... writing?

34:02.415 --> 34:04.917
The prime minister gives
a speech to Parliament.

34:04.917 --> 34:08.129
The speech doesn't even
mention Russia or Lenkov.

34:08.129 --> 34:12.175
But you invite the widow of the guy that
the Russians poisoned in London in '06,

34:12.175 --> 34:15.178
making it clear
that he's talking about Russia.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.596
- He loves a speech.
- He does.

34:16.596 --> 34:20.349
But like with the cobalt sanctions
and the travel ban, it is insufficient.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.518
Which is why you pitch all of them.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.146
On their own,
they feel like nothingburgers.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.981
But add them all up,

34:26.981 --> 34:29.484
- it'll feel like a fire hose of--
- Nothingburgers.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.653
- It'll feel like a multi-pronged assault.
- I think it won't.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.406
Well, sadly, "no" is not a pitch.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.743
Blow through them all fast,
make him feel like it's a--

34:38.743 --> 34:40.453
- Fire hose.
- Exactly.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.468
There you are.
- Were you looking for me?

34:55.468 --> 34:56.636
I was.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.847
I got this from one of the fine gentlemen
in the stables.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.474
Mm, a naughty stable boy?

35:01.474 --> 35:03.017
I thought he was nice.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.895
You are delicious.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.898
Can you be trusted to nick
a decent bottle from the cellar?

35:08.898 --> 35:11.109
- That's what I was born to do.
- Okay.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.361
You find us some food.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.612
Oh, and take these.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.449
If anyone asks,
you're going to watch the purple martins.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.409
They're small birds. They're not purple,

35:20.409 --> 35:23.246
but, well, somehow everyone thinks
they're worth a trek.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.248
Purple martins. Okay.

35:30.795 --> 35:31.629
A travel ban.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.049
On all Russian citizens.

35:36.676 --> 35:40.680
They kill 41 British sailors,
I spoil their mini-break in Kensington?

35:40.680 --> 35:43.224
If you coordinate the action
with the United States--

35:43.224 --> 35:45.393
I get to spoil their mini-break
in Palm Beach as well?

35:45.393 --> 35:46.310
India.

35:46.310 --> 35:50.648
We may be able to entice India
to join our Russia sanctions.

35:50.648 --> 35:51.816
I'm gonna kill myself.

35:51.816 --> 35:57.655
Well, the cumulative force
of a fire hose of diplomatic--

35:57.655 --> 35:59.740
Bullshit.
A fire hose of diplomatic bullshit.

35:59.740 --> 36:04.245
- What the foreign secretary is trying to--
- Yes, I know. But I cry bullshit!

36:04.871 --> 36:06.581
A month into the Ukraine war,

36:06.581 --> 36:10.084
we'd already crawled
all the way up the diplomatic ladder.

36:10.084 --> 36:13.129
We sanctioned Russian debt,
we embargoed their oil,

36:13.129 --> 36:15.214
and banned them from SWIFT, yes?

36:15.214 --> 36:17.758
We spanked, and we bluffed.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.178
And we smashed the rungs as we climbed.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.138
There are no moves left.

36:24.891 --> 36:28.394
Meanwhile, they've bombed
maternity wards in Mariupol,

36:29.228 --> 36:30.771
and shelled Chernobyl,

36:31.397 --> 36:35.651
and gone in Iranian fancy dress
to blow open our prized vessel.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.778
So why can't we follow suit?

36:39.155 --> 36:43.576
If we do what they do,
if we obliterate the rules-based order--

36:43.576 --> 36:45.703
What, that makes me a hypocrite?

36:45.703 --> 36:47.663
So what? I can think of worse words.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.832
How does "war criminal" suit?

36:49.832 --> 36:53.794
- Might be a good time to break for lunch.
- No, I will break for lunch.

36:53.794 --> 36:57.798
You will stay here, hungry and focused,

36:58.466 --> 37:01.260
until you can find
an in-kind response to Russia

37:01.260 --> 37:04.180
that does not make me
look like a wobbling pussy.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.990
After you, ma'am.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.037
Secretary Dennison,
could we borrow you for a moment?

37:28.037 --> 37:29.163
Of course.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.668
Excuse me?

37:33.668 --> 37:36.295
- Are they eating?
- It wouldn't be right.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.385
Hal Wyler.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.721
- Prime Minister, good to see you again.
- Come and help me make a dent.

37:45.721 --> 37:48.391
Ah. Where's the crew?

37:49.141 --> 37:52.436
I'm taking a leaf
from the book of St. Bonaventure.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.523
It's 1268, the cardinals
can't agree on a new pope,

37:55.523 --> 37:57.733
so, what does Bonnie do?

37:57.733 --> 37:59.026
Makes them a spread?

37:59.026 --> 38:03.406
He locks them up without any food
until they make up their fucking minds.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.325
- Ah.
- Three died, but it worked.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.120
- Jesus Christ.
- That's what the cardinals said.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.873
You've dealt with the Russians.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.418
Uh, yeah, a few times.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.421
Why has this lot gone limp
at the idea of a confrontation?

38:21.549 --> 38:23.092
What would you have me do?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.931
You'd have to ask the ambassador.

38:29.932 --> 38:33.436
I am off to find the purple martins.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.023
Purple what?

38:38.316 --> 38:39.817
The tox screen's still not back,

38:39.817 --> 38:42.778
but the Met Police would like to talk
to you no matter what it says.

38:42.778 --> 38:45.281
- Sir, you've already met with them?
- More than once.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.450
It would be helpful if we could, uh...

38:47.450 --> 38:49.618
- Get our stories straight.
- Exactly.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.120
You should sit.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.255
<i>- Sorry to pull you out.</i>
Not at all.

39:01.255 --> 39:03.883
<i>Just wanted to make sure
everyone's got the same timeline.</i>

39:03.883 --> 39:06.510
Happy to review.
It's been an issue already.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.097
It hasn't been an issue. No one noticed.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.807
Who wants to bring me up to speed?

39:11.807 --> 39:15.644
<i>I vaguely suggested I knew
when the ambassador's symptoms began,</i>

39:15.644 --> 39:17.480
which was before I arrived.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.231
- Nobody noticed.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.650
You noticed.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.194
<i>No.</i>
<i>He noticed.</i>

39:23.194 --> 39:26.030
I wouldn't have put it together
if you hadn't brought it up.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.825
But you noticed,
which means any of them may have.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.744
Well, the coughing fit largely covered.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.246
- Largely?
- It sounded like you swallowed a cat.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.247
<i>Let's move on.</i>

39:35.247 --> 39:38.667
What time did she reach the inside
of the foreign secretary's office?

39:43.714 --> 39:44.548
<i>You don't know?</i>

39:44.548 --> 39:46.550
I do. You don't...

39:47.176 --> 39:50.721
is the issue.
I've already been questioned.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.057
So it doesn't matter when I got there,

39:53.057 --> 39:55.476
what matters is when you said I got there.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.478
- Stuart?
- We haven't had lunch.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.272
<i>The medics arrived in the office at 16:26,</i>

40:00.272 --> 40:03.275
<i>so let's agree on 16:30.</i>

40:04.276 --> 40:07.154
<i>Where exactly did Ambassador Hajjar fall?</i>

40:07.154 --> 40:10.574
He dropped the teacup by the table,
he fell to the floor.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.659
No.

40:11.659 --> 40:15.913
I think I remember the sight
of the man dying in my office.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.290
He toppled to the ground,
you went to his side,

40:18.290 --> 40:20.376
said something encouraging,
I summoned help.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.337
No. He fell to the couch.
I helped him to the floor.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.714
- Oh, she's very helpful.
<i>She's not.</i>

40:25.714 --> 40:27.383
Because she didn't.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.261
She arrived after he was on the floor.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.347
She has no idea how he fell.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.392
<i>- Fuck.
- Yeah, she shouldn't talk to the police.</i>

40:36.392 --> 40:38.310
<i>Can we just kill this?</i>

40:43.023 --> 40:44.984
What's Trowbridge's deal?
Hmm?

40:44.984 --> 40:46.819
Is it an act, all that...?

40:46.819 --> 40:49.572
Some but not all.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.783
I remember the first time I saw him
rush up to the podium

40:52.783 --> 40:55.703
to read his remarks from scribbles
on the back of his hand,

40:55.703 --> 40:58.289
and check the logo behind him to see

40:58.289 --> 41:01.459
exactly what he was
supposed to be remarking on.

41:03.335 --> 41:08.924
I thought he was like a very bright
13-year-old boy with ADHD.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.051
I mean, erudite as fuck.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.053
Clever enough not to have to do the work

41:13.053 --> 41:16.724
but not quite slick enough to hide it.

41:17.516 --> 41:18.517
Mm.

41:19.018 --> 41:19.852
Swap.

41:21.854 --> 41:26.108
Second time I saw him rush to the stage
and check the backdrop,

41:26.984 --> 41:29.028
I realized I'd underestimated him.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.362
Faux casual.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.239
- That's a good trick.
- Mm-hm.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.579
Do you think it'll rain?

41:39.872 --> 41:42.458
Uh, no.
- I wish it would.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.126
Why?

41:46.420 --> 41:50.508
A bit of rain each day makes it easier
that my entire directive

41:50.508 --> 41:55.095
is to leave as little impression
on the skin of this world as is possible.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.732
Are you a moper?

42:08.108 --> 42:10.027
Am I--? A moper?

42:10.819 --> 42:11.737
A brooder.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.532
You know, a sad girl,

42:14.532 --> 42:17.952
a wistful, drifty,

42:17.952 --> 42:20.746
malnourished little fucking waif.

42:20.746 --> 42:24.166
Okay, well, I'm sitting here,
eating your cheese.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.835
- Yeah.
- Nibbling your parmesan.

42:26.835 --> 42:28.963
I'm a magnet for mopey women.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.215
I mean, come on.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.426
This may be one of the epic days
in the life of a man.

42:34.426 --> 42:37.888
I mean, the water's dancing,

42:37.888 --> 42:40.474
the air carries a whiff
of freshly cut hay,

42:40.474 --> 42:42.059
and we're here...

42:43.477 --> 42:47.147
commanded by crown and country
to devour the plunder of kings

42:47.147 --> 42:49.275
and the plenty of the land.

42:49.275 --> 42:52.528
And here I am with yet another woman

42:52.528 --> 42:56.240
who could find that one piece of cloud

42:56.240 --> 42:58.367
in every silver lining.

42:59.076 --> 42:59.994
Yeah.

43:01.161 --> 43:03.581
Your mopey wife is not my remit.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.667
In any case,
I've earned a touch of malaise.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.921
Objectively speaking,
I'm here to tell you,

43:10.921 --> 43:12.298
you fell in a tub of butter.

43:12.298 --> 43:16.594
You should have the good grace to shut
your mouth and rub it all over yourself.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.511
Right?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.098
I thought you were kind.

43:22.891 --> 43:25.227
Do you wind up with men who are unkind?

43:28.314 --> 43:30.107
Were they unkind at the start?

43:31.609 --> 43:33.819
My women weren't mopey at the start.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.867
I think I bring it out in them.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.997
- What are you doing?
- Getting away from you.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.249
I'm eating the world.

43:47.249 --> 43:51.587
I don't wanna waste this epic day
with an anhedonic.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.015
Whoo!

44:03.891 --> 44:05.017
Woo-hoo-hoo!

44:05.726 --> 44:07.144
It's glorious.

44:08.687 --> 44:09.688
Fuck yeah!

44:10.230 --> 44:12.316
Get in the fucking water.

44:14.109 --> 44:16.278
- Get in.
- Yeah.

44:16.278 --> 44:18.155
- Oh, come on.
- It looks cold.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.532
It's not. Get in the fucking water.

44:20.532 --> 44:25.329
Ugh. You are quite cruel, it turns out.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.790
Get in. Immediately.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.376
- It's murky.
- It's murky.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.628
Look, no, I'm not being mopey.

44:32.628 --> 44:35.089
There are fucking things growing out.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.840
- Jesus.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.385
Come on, dive. Dive.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.477
Jesus fucking Christ, it's cold!

44:48.477 --> 44:50.062
- No, it's not.
- Oh!

44:50.979 --> 44:52.481
Oh, fuck.

44:52.481 --> 44:53.565
Christ.

44:55.275 --> 44:57.152
Get over here and warm me up.

44:57.152 --> 45:00.989
Now, that, my wifty little waif, I can do.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.576
It's fucking cold.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.496
- Oh, shit.
- Oh...

45:08.747 --> 45:09.915
- Stay close.

45:24.012 --> 45:26.765
I think you ought to fuck me
for my troubles.

45:28.767 --> 45:29.977
Everything but.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.105
What does that mean?

45:36.400 --> 45:40.821
I'm... tragically devoted to my wife.

45:40.821 --> 45:41.947
Oh?

45:42.614 --> 45:45.325
Is this what tragic devotion looks like?

45:46.034 --> 45:47.870
Um, yeah.

45:49.163 --> 45:52.791
The machinery doesn't really
function with anyone else.

45:52.791 --> 45:55.377
- I don't believe you.
- No?

45:55.878 --> 45:57.546
Okay, feel for yourself.

46:00.716 --> 46:01.717
Ah.

46:02.509 --> 46:05.846
- Well, you know there are drugs for this.
- Mm-hm.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.599
There are. There are also wives for this.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.683
Ah.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.230
You are a bit of a downer, it turns out.

46:15.230 --> 46:18.108
- No wonder we all mope.
- Am I?

46:19.776 --> 46:21.153
Am I a downer?

46:56.396 --> 46:57.397
How's it going?

46:58.440 --> 47:00.817
Slouching toward Bethlehem.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.282
And what kind of therapy
are we trying today?

47:09.409 --> 47:11.119
Yeah, you caught me.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.413
I'm kind of fucked up.

47:14.957 --> 47:18.043
- Great.
- This is what the wives do, right?

47:20.087 --> 47:23.173
Drink a little wine, smoke a little pot.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.508
Take the air.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.136
Playing the part like a pro.

47:29.263 --> 47:32.099
I'm fucking killing myself
trying to prove to you

47:32.099 --> 47:34.518
that I can sit in the back seat
and just stay there.

47:34.518 --> 47:37.396
And it requires actual sedation.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.107
Jesus, Hal.

47:40.107 --> 47:45.654
You know, the PM asked me
how he should handle Russia,

47:45.654 --> 47:50.784
and I talked about
purple fucking bluebirds.

47:50.784 --> 47:53.954
I didn't give him any advice.
I didn't call anyone.

47:53.954 --> 47:57.165
I didn't rally support for you
behind your back. I--

47:57.165 --> 47:59.585
I went for a nice walk.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.169
I took a swim.

48:01.169 --> 48:04.464
I got my dick handled by a nubile thing,

48:04.464 --> 48:09.136
and it behaved the way it always does
when it's not you.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.263
And then I came here.

48:17.811 --> 48:18.687
Yes?

48:23.442 --> 48:26.612
Trowbridge wants to reenact
the Siege of Leningrad.

48:31.116 --> 48:32.159
Thoughts?

48:35.746 --> 48:37.122
It sounds bad.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.877
That's your only thought?
How stoned are you?

48:41.877 --> 48:44.713
I don't wanna get baited
into saying something

48:44.713 --> 48:46.173
that's gonna make you hate me.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.259
That's not what's happening here.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.678
All right, you want my help,
you don't want my help.

48:51.678 --> 48:54.806
I'm the smartest man you've ever met,
I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

48:54.806 --> 48:59.436
Can't we just admit
that I am not the only problem, Kate?

49:00.145 --> 49:01.688
What the fuck is this?

49:01.688 --> 49:06.151
Is this your latest stab
at saving our marriage?

49:06.151 --> 49:09.237
You're the wife? You do everything I ask?

49:09.237 --> 49:13.158
You're so goddamn docile
I'd be psychotic to let you go?

49:17.120 --> 49:17.954
Yeah.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.653
Mario, it's Kate Wyler.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.657
Once more unto the morass. Shall we?

49:59.663 --> 50:00.664
Stuart.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.711
Right, back to our agenda.
- Hold on. One second.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.754
One, Russia. Two, Russia.

50:07.754 --> 50:09.423
- Three-- Julian?
- Russia.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.590
Russia!

50:11.341 --> 50:13.552
Did you get the tox screen results yet?

50:13.552 --> 50:15.762
Yeah, but that's not why I'm calling.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.597
Why don't we start there anyhow?

50:18.223 --> 50:20.267
It wasn't poison. It was a heart attack.

50:20.267 --> 50:21.935
<i>- But that's not--</i>
- Yes!

50:21.935 --> 50:24.104
<i>Oh, I feel like a weight just...</i>

50:24.771 --> 50:27.482
- I feel like I just shat a brick.
<i>- Good for you.</i>

50:28.108 --> 50:29.693
Why is the ambassador calling DoD

50:29.693 --> 50:31.695
for a list of targets
they'd like to paint?

50:32.904 --> 50:34.281
Can you, in English?

50:34.281 --> 50:38.285
She called the Department of Defense
and asked for a list of things

50:38.285 --> 50:40.871
they'd feel comfortable bombing in Russia.

50:40.871 --> 50:44.332
I assume the answer is there's nothing
they'd be comfortable bombing--

50:44.332 --> 50:47.669
If you ask the military for a list
of things they'd like to blow up,

50:48.170 --> 50:49.713
they have answers.

50:55.510 --> 50:57.053
The European Union?

50:57.679 --> 50:58.513
Yes.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.057
And in your vision of this,

51:01.057 --> 51:03.477
do I fellate them
before they ask or during?

51:04.561 --> 51:05.437
I realize this--

51:05.437 --> 51:08.315
The Germans have cocks
small enough to suck while speaking,

51:08.315 --> 51:11.526
but the Belgians, surprisingly, do not.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.070
- Sir--
- We are Great Britain.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.947
We are Global Britain.

51:15.947 --> 51:19.868
We are not begging the EU
for some petty bureaucratic vengeance.

51:19.868 --> 51:22.913
As much as we might wish to shove back,

51:22.913 --> 51:27.209
we cannot poke the bear with the world's
second largest nuclear arsenal.

51:28.043 --> 51:31.421
We do what keeps all of us
away from the nuclear ceiling.

51:31.421 --> 51:34.299
- Sir, I'd like to jump in for a second.
- Ma'am?

51:34.299 --> 51:35.550
I think he'd like a word.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.886
- She's busy.
- If I could I finish my thought?

51:37.886 --> 51:40.222
- I don't think he liked it.
- If I could get a quick word?

51:40.222 --> 51:43.725
So, what, this is where you propose a
strongly-worded condemnation from the UN?

51:43.725 --> 51:46.144
- I don't think you'd like that either.
- I wouldn't.

51:46.144 --> 51:48.480
Forty-one British servicemen are dead.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.983
It is my responsibility
to honor their sacrifice,

51:51.983 --> 51:55.779
give solace to their families,
and demonstrate to this nation

51:55.779 --> 51:58.615
that they will be protected
by their fucking government.

51:58.615 --> 52:01.076
It sounds like you wanna bomb something.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.370
Why don't we do that?

52:06.456 --> 52:11.628
I have a list of Russian targets
provided by the Department of Defense.

52:11.628 --> 52:15.507
Why don't you pick one,
and we'll blow something up?
