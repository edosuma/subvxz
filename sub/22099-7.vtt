(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

00:22.856 --> 00:25.566
HELO: Previously
on Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.651 --> 00:28.820
Some people in the Fleet believe
that the legend of Earth held,

00:28.904 --> 00:31.698
perhaps, the greatest
promise for our survival.

00:31.782 --> 00:32.990
Do you know
how to find it?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.867
Not really, no.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.121
There was a hope, my hope, that
if you knew the way to Earth,

00:38.205 --> 00:40.665
it would justify keeping
you alive a little longer.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.252
Now when I say that I do not
know exactly where Earth is,

00:44.336 --> 00:45.795
that is not to say
that I do not know

00:45.879 --> 00:48.089
a very great deal
about its probable location.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.340
DORAL: A Baseship,

00:49.425 --> 00:52.260
the one we sent to investigate
the pulsars in the Lion nebula,

00:52.344 --> 00:53.428
we've lost contact.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.637
CAPRICA SIX:
The missing Baseship,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.222
it's been infected
by some kind of disease.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.932
If an infected Cylon dies

00:58.016 --> 01:00.226
and carries this disease with
them into a Resurrection ship,

01:00.310 --> 01:03.563
it could rapidly spread, potentially
infecting our entire race.

01:03.647 --> 01:08.359
If one of us is resurrected,
the disease will follow.

01:08.444 --> 01:11.738
Then no Cylon can board that
ship without risking infection.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.657
I'll go.
Yes, I'll go.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.242
I can go to
the Baseship.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.328
I can make observations about the
Cylons, their physical condition,

01:19.413 --> 01:24.292
bring back information about this
disease which now threatens all of you.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.918
BALTAR: Do you know
what this is?

01:26.003 --> 01:28.296
It must be
some kind of beacon.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.591
It must have been left here
by the Thirteenth Tribe.

01:31.675 --> 01:36.471
A beacon carried the disease, left
by some humans like you to destroy us.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.599
You noticed nothing suspicious
on the infected ship?

01:39.683 --> 01:41.768
Nothing whatsoever.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.645
I am just as
baffled as you are.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.528
RACETRACK: Just like
the scriptures say.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.365
There it is, the Lion's Head
nebula and the Blinking Eye.

Holy crap, it's the road to Earth!

dressed and ready, plan A.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.758
We are approaching
the Baseship.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.438
It is just so wrong.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.440
What the hell happened here?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.901
ATHENA: Whatever this is,
it's something new.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.909
Go.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.912
Apollo, Galactica.
You are cleared hot.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.207
APOLLO: Roger that,
Galactica.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.667
We're in pretty close now.

02:47.751 --> 02:51.546
By the look of it, that ship's
in no condition to put up a fight.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.465
I've never seen anything
like this. Shall we proceed?

02:54.550 --> 02:56.092
Hang on, guys!

02:56.176 --> 02:58.636

We're in.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.328

No sign of life.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.831
Ship appears to be
abandoned and powering down.

(COUGHS)

04:40.322 --> 04:42.531

04:42.616 --> 04:46.911
I don't know, but their frakking
Resurrection ship's gonna overheat.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.465
Galactica, Apollo. We've
reached the control center.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.218
Thirty, maybe forty
dead skin jobs.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.554
Mathias,
set a perimeter!

05:05.639 --> 05:10.017
Sharon, Athena, see what you
can pick up in the computers.

each doorway. Go!

05:13.563 --> 05:14.772
MARINE: Yes, sir.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.487
ATHENA: Okay, I'm gonna
try to call up the database.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.782
If I get a connection, put the
SSR leads in the water over there.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.494
Reduce the error correction
levels for highest throughput.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.461

you wanna do that?

05:53.145 --> 05:55.980
Yeah. The data points are
almost completely corroded.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.026
I don't know if I'm gonna get
much out of here, but let's try.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.453
What is going on?

inside all perimeters.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.086
Frak me!

over here!

cover the Major!

got one, two, three, four,

06:30.849 --> 06:32.850
five living skin jobs
down here.

pretty bad shape.

make any threatening moves...

trust me on that one.

Should we take them out?

Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena!

07:15.018 --> 07:17.394
What are you doing?

Save yourself.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.372
Keep away from us.

keep your heads!

08:00.355 --> 08:03.065
Watch the doorways!
Get the doorways!

08:06.403 --> 08:09.738
Galactica, Apollo. We
have a situation down here.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.079
The Cylons have been
infected with a disease.

08:18.415 --> 08:22.751

aboard under quarantine procedures.

Clear a path from the hangar
deck to sickbay and sterilize it,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.237
and the Raptors
after they're in.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.905
I'll handle that.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.740
How long will they have
to stay in quarantine?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.158
I won't know that until
I do the blood work.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.619
Could be days, weeks,
there's no way to tell.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.996
You said they picked up
this disease from a beacon?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.581
According to the Cylons.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.167
Always good to have the
source of the pathogen.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.002
Can you bring it
aboard Galactica?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.922
No, too dangerous. I want
to limit our exposure.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.465
What about
the prisoners?

09:51.549 --> 09:52.591
Prisoners?

09:52.676 --> 09:54.593
The disease is more
advanced in their systems,

09:54.678 --> 09:58.472
so it'll give me at least an idea
of what to expect as it progresses.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.935
And when they die, it'll tell me
how long our people have to live.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.186
How many prisoners?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.813
How many you got?

You all right out there?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.969
Yeah, affirmative.
We're still here.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.262
What the hell
happened?

10:38.346 --> 10:40.431
Baseship exploded.
Must've self-destructed.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.474
You guys are lucky
you got out when you did.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.226
Roger that.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.342
Nothing the matter, I trust?

11:16.426 --> 11:17.843
We have some questions.

to betray us, Gaius?

11:23.475 --> 11:24.892
Funny.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.359
You're joking, of course.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.277
You're only making this
harder on yourself.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.112
Wait a minute.

11:37.197 --> 11:41.200
I have been more than very
accommodating since I arrived here.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.119
I helped you
find Sharon's baby.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.871
I've helped you
with the map towards Earth.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.831
We know about
the beacon, Gaius.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.752
You knew it was out there. You
knew it contained a deadly virus.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.254
No, I didn't.
I didn't.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.174
Was the virus
created by Galactica?

11:57.258 --> 12:00.219
D'ANNA: Have you been in contact with
them since you've been on onboard,

12:00.303 --> 12:03.972
or did you plan this before
the evacuation of New Caprica?

12:09.354 --> 12:12.981
This is a most
profound misunderstanding.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.736
No. I had nothing to do
with the virus or the beacon.

12:17.821 --> 12:22.533
Yes. Yes, I did discover it
on the Baseship

12:22.617 --> 12:26.078
and I should have told you
about it sooner, and I didn't.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.747
Because I thought, you know,
you'd try and link me, you know,

12:28.832 --> 12:31.792
to the virus, which is
what is going on right now.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.419
I was wrong
and it was a mistake,

12:33.503 --> 12:35.379
and I fully admit
my responsibility.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.755
It will never happen again,

12:36.840 --> 12:42.719
and I hope you accept my most,
you know, my most humble apology.

12:48.351 --> 12:53.355
On a brighter note, I have a working
theory as to where this beacon may...

13:01.197 --> 13:03.240
I'm sorry, Gaius.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.453
Things would've been so much
simpler had you only told the truth.

13:10.165 --> 13:14.501
We think you know more about this
virus and we intend to find out.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.069
Relax, have a drink.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.573
I can't.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.829
The pain, the pain...

13:50.914 --> 13:53.040
It's all in
your head, Gaius.

13:53.124 --> 13:57.085
Pain, pleasure, they're just
neural impulses sent to the brain.

to feel this pain.

Yeah. I feel sick.
Sick of you bugging me.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.370
You didn't touch
any infected skin jobs.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.330
It's not my fault
you're clumsy.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.082
You can kiss
my infected ass.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.544
Well, you can kiss it, but it's not
infected. I got your blood work back.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.963

15:23.047 --> 15:24.172

No, no, no, no, no. Please.
Tell me she's okay.

her blood work yet.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.197
What?

I see. She can wait
because of who she isn't.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.374
You're gonna be okay,
I promise.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.698
I can't cure them,
but yes.

How long?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.701
Indefinitely.

17:15.785 --> 17:20.497
I identified the virus. We know
it as "Lymphocytic encephalitis. "

17:20.581 --> 17:22.833
The disease is carried
by rodents, rats, mostly.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.503
But a couple of hundred years
ago, humans developed an immunity.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.714
Now I can create
a simple vaccine

17:28.798 --> 17:32.592
that will dramatically reverse the
effect of the virus on the Cylons.

17:32.677 --> 17:38.098
But they have an antibody in their blood
which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine.

17:38.182 --> 17:43.353
So they will need regular, close-interval
injections of the vaccine or they will die.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.896
Can I ask
the ugly question here?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.899
Is there any reason
to keep them alive?

17:47.984 --> 17:51.194
We could interrogate them
for intelligence.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.740
I agree. We have a lot
of unanswered questions.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.825
Yeah, okay,
but they're not gonna talk.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.410
ROSLIN: Well, they might
if we dangle the vaccine.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.830
They don't need to know
it's a stopgap, not a cure.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.084
They prayed
on the infected ship.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.629
Karl's wife said it was something called,
"The Prayer to the Cloud of Unknowing,"

18:09.714 --> 18:10.797
whatever the hell that is.

18:10.882 --> 18:14.259
Anyway, the point is,
she said they only use it

18:14.343 --> 18:16.636
when they're facing an
imminent death that is final,

18:16.721 --> 18:18.764
no possibility of downloading.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.806
They're ready to die.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.057
They may be ready to die,

18:21.142 --> 18:25.562
but it doesn't mean that one of
them won't jump at a second chance.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.911
It infected everything,

18:42.580 --> 18:48.043
the Baseship,
Centurions, Raiders,

18:49.212 --> 18:54.841
and so we were finally abandoned
by the other Cylon ships.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.301
Why?

18:57.762 --> 19:01.681
Why not just put you under
quarantine until they found a cure?

19:01.766 --> 19:05.310
Fear of spreading
the disease.

19:08.898 --> 19:13.026
They told us that there was a
bio-electric feedback component

19:13.110 --> 19:15.070
to the pathogen.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.616
It corrupts how our brains
manage our immune systems.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.369
(COUGHING)

19:23.704 --> 19:29.709
If one of us dies and is
resurrected, the disease will follow,

19:30.586 --> 19:35.841
infecting the Resurrection
ship and the Fleet.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.010
Why were you in this
area in the first place?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.596
We were sent.

19:41.681 --> 19:46.434
We were sent here
to look for the Lion nebula.

19:48.688 --> 19:53.233
Baltar said it would
point the way to Earth.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.734
What did you just say?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.487
Baltar...
Baltar's alive?

19:57.572 --> 20:00.949
Baltar is on our Baseship.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.413
He's helping us find Earth.

20:06.497 --> 20:12.002
He's using our navigation charts
along with our map of Kobol.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.170
He's leading them to Earth.

20:18.509 --> 20:24.306
We want a new beginning,

20:27.101 --> 20:28.852
much like you.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.483
I gave you information.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.613
She said that
there was a cure.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.743
Doc Cottle will be
giving you the medicine.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.286
Take him back
to the infirmary.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.829
MARINE: Yes, sir.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.353
(APOLLO LAUGHING)

21:13.814 --> 21:15.857
What the hell is so funny?

21:19.362 --> 21:23.531
I think I just thought of a way
to solve all of our problems,

21:24.784 --> 21:28.203
to get rid of the Cylon threat
for once and for all.

21:28.287 --> 21:32.207
We can wipe them out. We can
destroy the entire Cylon race.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.179
APOLLO: We jump to an area we know
the Cylons use as a supply line,

21:46.263 --> 21:47.931
NCD2539.

21:48.015 --> 21:52.394
We stay there, exposed. We look
as if we're spoiling for a fight.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.020
They'll send their fleet.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.481
And where there's a fleet,
there's a Resurrection ship.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.235
Now, once the Resurrection
ship is within our reach,

22:00.319 --> 22:04.489
we execute our infected
prisoners. We bug out.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.908
The executed prisoners download
into the Resurrection ship

22:06.993 --> 22:08.326
and with them, the virus.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.745
You're sure the virus
will download to a new body?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.581
The Cylons are sure of it.

22:13.666 --> 22:18.920
They left their wounded out here to
die alone with no hope of being rescued,

22:19.005 --> 22:20.588
that tells me
all I need to know.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.509
And once the virus
is in the Resurrection ship,

22:24.593 --> 22:25.844
there'll be no stopping it.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.930
Rescuers become carriers
of the plague.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.976
The Cylons themselves don't
believe that they'll develop a cure.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.480
My Gods.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.942
This could be the end
of the Cylons entirely.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.902
Forever.
Genocide?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.531
So that's what
we're about now?

22:46.615 --> 22:50.869
They're not human. They
were built, not born.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.455
No fathers, no mothers,
no sons, no daughters...

22:53.539 --> 22:55.749
I had a daughter.
I held her in my arms.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.333
She was half human.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.878
These are things,
dangerous things.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.671
This is our one chance
to be rid of them.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.840
You can rationalize it
any way you want.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.427
We do this,
we wipe out their race,

23:07.511 --> 23:08.636
then we're no different
than they are.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.140
ROSLIN: Captain,
I respectfully disagree.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.225
The Cylons struck
first in this war.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.520
And not being content with the
annihilation of billions of human beings,

23:17.605 --> 23:20.023
they've pursued us relentlessly
through the galaxies,

23:20.107 --> 23:21.274
determined to wipe us out.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.069
They tried to live
with us on New Caprica.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.195
What did you say?

23:25.279 --> 23:27.739
They tried to live
with us on New Caprica.

23:27.823 --> 23:32.285
You were not on New Caprica. To my
recollection you didn't set foot there.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.746
So out of respect for the hundreds
of men and women on your crew

23:34.830 --> 23:36.748
who suffered
through that snake pit,

23:36.832 --> 23:39.334
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.755
You would serve your fleet well
if you would remember occasionally

23:43.839 --> 23:45.090
that the Cylons
are a mortal threat

23:45.174 --> 23:46.508
to the survival
of the human race.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.844
I'm talking about
right and wrong.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.972
I'm talking about losing
a piece of our souls.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.727
But no one wants to hear that,
right? Let's keep it on me.

23:58.896 --> 24:02.440
Yeah, I'm married to a Cylon

24:02.525 --> 24:05.527
who walked through hell
for all of us how many times?

24:05.611 --> 24:08.279
And she's not half anything.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.949
Okay, how do we know
there aren't others like her?

24:11.033 --> 24:15.912
She made a choice. She's a
person, they're a race of people.

24:15.996 --> 24:20.083
Wiping them out with a biological
weapon is a crime against...

24:20.167 --> 24:22.794
Is a crime against humanity.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.755
But they're not human.
They're programmed.

24:28.551 --> 24:33.221
We will take your input under
advisement. Thank you both.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.056
Thank you, ma'am.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.145
Dismissed.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.185
I can guide you through
the torment and beyond,

25:20.269 --> 25:21.728

to do the work.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.192
I'll do anything.
Anything!

25:27.276 --> 25:29.777
Then tell us
what we want to know.

25:30.779 --> 25:35.241
How was the virus invented?
Did they make a cure?

25:37.745 --> 25:41.080
Look at me.
Look at me.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.458
When you make
love to me, Gaius,

25:43.542 --> 25:45.877
you don't always
think about me.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.463
Your mind wanders,
I know that.

25:48.547 --> 25:52.383
You think of equations,
puzzles, your laundry...

25:54.136 --> 25:58.973
It's the nature of the mind to disconnect
from the body and journey on its own.

26:02.228 --> 26:06.397
Separate your mind from your
body. Keep your mind in that room.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.068
Use your intellect
against her.

26:10.152 --> 26:14.030
Reason. Logic.
Analysis.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.408
Find the holes
in her psyche.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.327
I can't. The pain...

26:19.495 --> 26:24.082
The pain is only in your body,
so keep your body here with me.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.630
Don't worry,
I'll care take of it.

26:35.594 --> 26:40.014
D'ANNA: You see, Gaius, this is
what the absence of pain feels like.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.692
It's easy to forget.

26:50.776 --> 26:55.947
I had nothing to do with the
virus. It was a coincidence.

26:56.031 --> 26:59.325
There's no such thing
as coincidence.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.704
God wills the universe
according to His design.

27:03.914 --> 27:08.543
Now focus on her
as a Cylon, not a woman.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.131
Be a scientist.
Examine her faith.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.968
What's your analysis, Doctor?

27:21.724 --> 27:23.558
I'm a scientist.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.438
And as a scientist,

27:29.732 --> 27:33.109
I believe that if God exists, our
knowledge of him is imperfect. Why?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.320
Because the stories
and myths we have

27:35.404 --> 27:39.032
are the products of men,
the passage of time.

27:39.116 --> 27:43.578
The religion you practice is based
on a theory, impossible to prove,

27:43.662 --> 27:46.581
yet you bestow it
with absolutes like

27:46.665 --> 27:48.666
"there is no such thing
as coincidence. "

27:48.751 --> 27:50.543
It's called faith.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.714
Absolute belief in God's will means
there's a reason for everything.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.632
Everything!

27:56.717 --> 27:59.177
And yet,

27:59.261 --> 28:04.432
you can't help ask yourself how
God can allow death and destruction,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.768
and then despise yourself for asking.

28:06.852 --> 28:10.480
But the truth is, if we knew God's
will, we'd all be Gods, wouldn't we?

28:10.564 --> 28:12.815
I can see it
in your eyes, D'Anna.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.569
You're frustrated. You're
conflicted. Let me help you.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.946
Let me help you change,

28:19.031 --> 28:22.742
find a way to reconcile
your faith with fact,

28:22.826 --> 28:25.203
find a way towards
a rational universe!

I don't know
what your game is,

28:26.747 --> 28:29.040
but it's not going to work.

ships to that beacon, didn't you?

you believe in me.

in my strength.

29:25.973 --> 29:30.268

I love you with all my heart.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.235
How?

30:21.987 --> 30:25.490
Cottle said it had something to do
with carrying a half-human child,

30:25.574 --> 30:28.993
how the fetal blood cells enter
the maternal circulatory system,

30:29.077 --> 30:33.080
causing the mother to create
antibodies, whatever. I'm immune!

30:34.082 --> 30:36.167
Oh, you.

30:44.218 --> 30:47.470
Our baby saved my life.

30:49.473 --> 30:54.519
She's gone forever and she saved
my life. Hera kept us together.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.398
To share this.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.275
"This"?

31:01.360 --> 31:05.530
What, you mean us,
together? You mean us?

31:05.614 --> 31:09.492
Them, them.
I mean them.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.203
Who's "them"?

31:24.007 --> 31:27.635
They're gonna execute
the infected prisoners,

31:27.719 --> 31:31.097
but not until we jump
into a Cylon region,

31:31.181 --> 31:33.891
with a Resurrection
ship present.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.231
The infection's
gonna spread everywhere.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.484
(SOBBING)

31:55.205 --> 31:57.623
There's a point
I'd like to make.

31:59.668 --> 32:03.838
The law forbids me
to use biological weapons

32:03.922 --> 32:05.715
without a direct
presidential order.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.759
Which means
you're passing the buck.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.553
On this one, yes.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.015
Helo's right
on one thing.

32:15.767 --> 32:20.771
We start destroying entire
races, even mechanical races,

32:20.856 --> 32:24.942
we're liable to tear off
a piece of a man's soul.

32:25.027 --> 32:28.029
The Cylons
are coming to Earth.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.240
If they find us,
they are coming for us.

32:31.325 --> 32:34.952
Those are the stakes.
They always have been, Bill.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.169
We're talking about the
genocide of your entire race.

32:47.674 --> 32:51.218
Yeah. You think
I don't know that?

32:53.180 --> 32:56.724
I made a choice
to wear a uniform.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.895
To be a person.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.982
You were a person before you
put on that uniform, okay?

33:05.067 --> 33:07.151
You were a person before
I fell in love with you.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.486
You don't have to prove that.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.238

Let me tell you
something, Helo.

33:16.286 --> 33:21.415
My people may die, my
entire race may be wiped out,

33:27.381 --> 33:30.383
but this Cylon
will keep her word,

33:30.467 --> 33:34.261
even if it means she's the
last Cylon left in the universe.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.726
Can a human being do that?

33:46.942 --> 33:50.361
Posterity really doesn't look
too kindly on genocide.

33:50.445 --> 33:54.490
You're making an assumption that
posterity will define this as genocide.

If they do, at least there'll be
someone alive to hate us for it.

34:01.498 --> 34:04.417
The Cylons are our
mistake, we created them.

34:07.629 --> 34:08.921
All right, Admiral Adama,

34:09.005 --> 34:12.383
as President, I have determined
the Cylons be made extinct.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.803
The use of biological
weapons is authorized.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.891
So say we all.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.476
(SCOFFS)

34:23.812 --> 34:25.646
So say we all.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.579
Jump complete. Dradis
is clear, no Cylons, sir.

34:41.663 --> 34:45.166
They'll be here soon enough.
Get our birds in the air.

34:46.209 --> 34:48.002
Commence Viper
and nav Raptor launch.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.671
CREWMAN: Once more there!
Let's get it closed. Let's go!

34:50.756 --> 34:53.132
Let's do this,
Racetrack.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.675
CREWMAN 1: Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

34:54.760 --> 34:55.843
CREWMAN 2: Prepare the tubes!

34:55.927 --> 34:57.845
CREWMAN 3: Spinning up.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.513
CREWMAN 4: All up!

35:31.546 --> 35:35.257
Let's go! Let's go!
Move them back!

35:36.218 --> 35:37.551
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

35:45.477 --> 35:48.145
Cap is away. Nav Bird
has them on Dradis.

36:05.914 --> 36:09.834
Dradis contact.
Pair of Cylon Raiders.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.335
Keeping their
distance for now.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.297
Didn't take them
that long. It's just scouts.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.551
They'll jump away and
report back to their fleet.

36:18.635 --> 36:19.927
See if they take our bait.

36:24.933 --> 36:28.394
Got it. There's a
Resurrection ship with them.

36:28.478 --> 36:32.940
Then it's time to execute our
Cylon prisoners. Call it in.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.321
Terminate the prisoners.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.120
Head shots, okay?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.246
Yes, sir.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.956
Let's do it.

36:55.088 --> 36:59.884
Let's see if we can't frak up some
toasters on this joyride, people.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.229
HOTDOG: Bogies holding hands,
I'm notching like hell up here!

37:12.314 --> 37:13.939
Hot Dog, Starbuck.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.984
Quit your bitching and
continue to cover us, frak!

37:26.620 --> 37:28.704
All right,
out of the way.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.928
Frak! They're already dead.
They're already dead.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.558
Sir,
you should hear this.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.102
APOLLO: They were dead before the
Resurrection ship was in range.

37:52.187 --> 37:56.231
They didn't download the disease.
We have missed our window.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.987
Galactica, Starbuck.
The Baseship just jumped in.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.198
Call our birds in.
Spool up.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.616
Let's get
the hell out of here.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.951
Commence it, Theo!
Yes, sir!

38:07.035 --> 38:08.744
Sir, we've lost time waiting
to hear from quarantine.

38:08.828 --> 38:12.373
We're going to take significant
fire while we spool up.

38:14.668 --> 38:15.960
Wait a minute.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.053
Continue jump.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.097
Take us back to our fleet.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.223
Yes, sir.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.114
They're coming for me.
You or me.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.788
It seems like they're
always coming for one of us.

38:56.459 --> 39:01.088
I'm not a traitor. I love
my people, I love this ship.

39:04.426 --> 39:09.263
Besides you, the first I want to see on
any morning are the lights in that CIC.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.144
But I did what
I thought was right.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.772
If it was a mistake,
fine, I can live with that.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.240
It's you I can't live without.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.259
I'll always love you, Helo.

39:55.435 --> 39:56.977
No, thanks.

40:03.943 --> 40:04.943
(SIGHS)

40:06.488 --> 40:10.324
The prisoners died
of asphyxiation.

40:10.408 --> 40:15.412
The air purification system was
reversed. Sucked the oxygen out.

40:15.497 --> 40:18.123
When this happens,
the dead bolts

40:18.208 --> 40:20.667
are automatically
activated on the door.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.047
Someone did this manually.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.173
Someone?

40:27.467 --> 40:31.678
Seems to me there's only
one or two likely suspects.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.555
Who will head
the investigation?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.767
No one. I'm closing the book on this.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.602
How convenient.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.240
Cottle's report
on the virus.

40:51.324 --> 40:56.578
He thinks that it was simply
an accidental contamination

40:56.663 --> 41:01.500
of the beacon we abandoned
on the sickbay ship.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.710
Somebody sneezed, maybe?

41:03.795 --> 41:07.214
Yeah, an entire race
almost wiped out

41:07.298 --> 41:10.509
because someone forgot
to wipe their nose.

41:19.144 --> 41:25.649
According to Cottle,
the virus was an exact match

41:25.733 --> 41:29.695
to one reported
over 3,000 years ago,

41:29.779 --> 41:33.365
right around the time that the
Thirteenth Colony left Kobol.

41:33.449 --> 41:38.412
That beacon
was a signpost to Earth.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.123
I think we're on
the right trail, Laura.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.625
Yes, we are
on the right trail, Bill.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.130
So are the Cylons.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.759
