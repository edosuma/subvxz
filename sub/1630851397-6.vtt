WEBVTT

00:42.125 --> 00:44.958
-Hess, we're inside.
-<i>He's not there, right?</i>

00:45.041 --> 00:48.166
No, it's all empty.
Check outdoor areas, the basement,

00:48.250 --> 00:51.333
<i>the roof terrace, and with the neighbors.</i>
<i>Find him now!</i>

00:51.416 --> 00:53.333
And Thulin? Has she been there?

00:53.416 --> 00:56.791
<i>There are no signs of her,</i>
<i>but we'll check the CCTV footage.</i>

00:56.875 --> 00:58.458
When did we last hear from her?

00:59.291 --> 01:02.708
She insisted on seeing Genz
at the forensics centre.

01:02.791 --> 01:07.208
They talked for two hours before
she voluntarily went with him to his car.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.416
Then they left.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.250
<i>We found her cell phone</i>
<i>in his trash bin at the office.</i>

01:12.333 --> 01:14.000
And the APB on his car?

01:14.083 --> 01:19.083
<i>Nothing. Genz told his assistant</i>
<i>he was going to a conference in Esbjerg.</i>

01:19.166 --> 01:21.208
<i>But that</i>
<i>and so many other things were lies.</i>

01:21.291 --> 01:25.208
<i>He changed his name to Simon Genz</i>
<i>when he was 18 years old.</i>

01:25.291 --> 01:28.083
Has Thulin's family heard from her?

01:28.166 --> 01:32.958
<i>No. I spoke to the grandfather.</i>
<i>They were at a school event</i>.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.666
She asked
a lot of questions about chestnuts.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.750
Chestnuts?

01:39.791 --> 01:43.458
Something in the apartment
has got to indicate where he's gone.

01:43.541 --> 01:47.125
Check the apartment,
phone, email, his debit card--

01:47.208 --> 01:49.916
<i>Hess! Everyone's working on it.</i>

01:50.000 --> 01:54.125
<i>We're focusing on the Copenhagen area.</i>
<i>Places which Genz has had access to</i>.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.000
<i>Ferries and airports, of course.</i>
<i>We're doing everything we can.</i>

01:58.416 --> 01:59.250
I know.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.583
I'll drive to Copenhagen now.

02:14.916 --> 02:16.583
No, I don't think it'll be late.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.500
Well, that's good.

02:22.666 --> 02:24.416
I'll see you later then.

02:25.791 --> 02:29.166
Yes, and remember
that today is a good day.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.750
-Yes.
-Genz!

02:33.708 --> 02:35.958
See if you can find
the owner's phone number.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.166
Genz, are you coming?

02:45.583 --> 02:47.208
The owner's not registered.

02:47.291 --> 02:52.416
It's probably the right type of tree,
but I think the place is abandoned.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.291
No, it's not quite abandoned.
The camera looks quite new.

03:00.541 --> 03:02.291
And there's a laptop.

03:43.541 --> 03:47.333
-Where'd you get that?
-It was under the planter over there.

04:20.791 --> 04:21.833
Police!

05:20.500 --> 05:22.958
Genz, this looks
like our tracking equipment.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.416
POLICE

05:28.791 --> 05:30.333
What the hell?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.541
And our photos.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.750
Call Nylander. We need units out here.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.958
There may be traces of Kristine here.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.666
Genz, are you calling?

05:46.375 --> 05:47.958
I'm expecting a guest.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.083
But no more people.
There's already too many.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.458
I knew it was risky
using the chestnuts from the farm, but…

06:02.750 --> 06:04.458
on the other hand, it had to be them.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.083
Genz…

06:16.000 --> 06:18.250
Tell me
you didn't kill all of those people.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.458
-Please tell me you didn't.
-I did.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.458
Sometimes you need to see
the bigger picture.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.750
-Give me your weapon.
-I don't have it. It's in the car.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.000
Lie down.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.041
Show me your hands. Now.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.000
No!

07:03.250 --> 07:05.333
I told you
you should have gone home.

07:06.791 --> 07:07.875
I told you.

07:50.791 --> 07:54.375
THE CHESTNUT MAN

07:58.250 --> 08:00.083
<i>So far, the police offer no comment</i>

08:00.166 --> 08:02.791
<i>on the search</i>
<i>for social minister Rosa Hartung</i>

08:02.875 --> 08:05.541
<i>which was announced a short while ago.</i>

08:05.625 --> 08:07.625
<i>According to anonymous police sources,</i>

08:07.708 --> 08:10.333
<i>the life of the minister</i>
<i>is presumed to be in danger.</i>

08:10.416 --> 08:15.083
<i>Police and intelligence services</i>
<i>are using all of their resources</i>

08:15.166 --> 08:16.916
<i>to find the minister.</i>

08:17.000 --> 08:20.208
<i>The search for Rosa Hartung</i>
<i>comes just a few days</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:22.958
<i>after the so-called "Chestnut Man" case</i>
<i>was finally closed.</i>

08:23.041 --> 08:25.916
<i>The case led to speculation</i>
<i>as to whether the minister's daughter,</i>

08:26.000 --> 08:29.083
<i>12-year-old Kristine Hartung,</i>
<i>was still alive.</i>

08:29.166 --> 08:31.208
I'm sorry, but can I ask you something?

08:36.041 --> 08:38.208
-Sorry.
-A Citroën DS7.

08:40.666 --> 08:41.875
Can I ask you something?

08:43.791 --> 08:47.583
Tell Nylander
that the brass wants a briefing ASAP.

08:47.666 --> 08:49.833
Hello? I need to ask you something.

08:49.916 --> 08:53.291
-Sorry, just a sec.
-No. No "just a sec."

08:53.375 --> 08:56.708
-You were the ones asking us to come.
-I'm so sorry.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.416
Thanks for coming.

08:59.625 --> 09:00.958
Let's go this way.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.125
<i>Did you find anything?</i>

09:06.208 --> 09:08.291
Nothing here of importance to him.

09:08.375 --> 09:11.916
There's the Jessie Kvium action plan
and the trace report,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.041
which he must have used to find
Rasouli and Skans before we did.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.208
<i>There are some images from CCTV footage.</i>

09:17.291 --> 09:18.208
What of?

09:18.291 --> 09:20.750
<i>One of Thulin and one of you and Thulin.</i>

09:20.833 --> 09:22.375
Boss, you need to see this.

09:22.458 --> 09:25.375
They just handed me
a photo of a little girl.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.791
It was used as a bookmark.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.958
<i>-Of Kristine?</i>
-No, it's an old photo.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.708
I'm guessing it's his twin sister Astrid.

09:31.791 --> 09:34.416
We're not the only ones
he's been surveilling.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.291
There's a frozen image here.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.500
We were unable to re-connect.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.291
-Maybe a kitchen in a cottage?
-<i>What do you see?</i>

09:41.916 --> 09:43.791
There are some newspapers on the table.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.208
<i>Which newspapers?</i> <i>Local ones?</i>

09:48.208 --> 09:49.041
German.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.958
-German?
<i>-Yes.</i>

09:53.083 --> 09:56.500
<i>Send me everything you've got.</i>
<i>We need to check if they drove to Germany.</i>

09:56.583 --> 09:58.833
<i>I'm on it. I've got to go.</i>

09:58.916 --> 10:01.625
<i>Steen Hartung is at the station.</i>
<i>I need to talk to him.</i>

10:02.125 --> 10:03.625
Maybe I'll learn something new.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.708
<i>You've reached Naia Thulin.</i>

10:16.791 --> 10:19.000
<i>I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

10:19.666 --> 10:21.083
Is she still not picking up?

10:23.208 --> 10:24.041
No.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.000
But…

10:27.791 --> 10:30.000
She'll call us as soon as she can.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.916
Let's go shopping for dinner.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.791
We're having curried meatballs.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.500
Then we'll go trick or treating
with the others.

10:42.583 --> 10:43.458
Listen up, Le.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.625
I'm sure it's just her case delaying her.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.416
Otherwise, she'd be here with you.

10:51.666 --> 10:52.583
She loves you.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.083
Can we call the man
with the different colored eyes?

11:00.333 --> 11:01.333
Who's that?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.583
Yes, I received them.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.958
<i>Hello.</i>

11:24.041 --> 11:26.875
<i>Sorry to disturb you.</i> <i>My name's Aksel.</i>

11:26.958 --> 11:33.000
<i>I'm Naia's foster dad and Le's grandpa.</i>
<i>I assume you've heard of me.</i>

11:33.083 --> 11:33.916
I have.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.583
I'm here with Le
and we're trying to reach her mom.

11:38.666 --> 11:41.083
We haven't been able to, though, so…

11:41.166 --> 11:44.583
We were wondering if you might
be able to chat with Le for a minute.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.500
<i>I'll assume</i>
<i>you'll think carefully right now.</i>

11:50.791 --> 11:51.916
Great. Thank you.

11:52.541 --> 11:54.291
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.458
-I'm the one who wants to talk to you.
-<i>Hi, Le.</i>

11:58.791 --> 12:03.875
It's just that there's something important
I want to say to my mom.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.083
She's not picking up.
Do you know where she is?

12:06.166 --> 12:08.791
No, not right now, but…

12:10.000 --> 12:12.750
When I see her,
I'll tell her that you'll call, okay?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.250
Just tell her it's okay.

12:15.875 --> 12:16.708
<i>What's okay?</i>

12:17.458 --> 12:19.166
Please just tell her it's okay.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.625
<i>That it's okay?</i>

12:23.583 --> 12:27.583
<i>Grandpa says I need to hang up now,</i>
<i>so would you give her my message?</i>

12:32.166 --> 12:33.000
<i>Hello?</i>

12:34.666 --> 12:36.166
You know what, Le? I…

12:37.875 --> 12:38.958
I'll find your mom.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.416
Then you can tell her yourself.
Is that a deal?

12:43.166 --> 12:44.375
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

13:09.791 --> 13:13.583
THE CHESTNUT FARM

13:26.041 --> 13:28.875
I don't know anything.
The minister's PA, Liv,

13:28.958 --> 13:32.833
said Rosa found the old case and left.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.250
She didn't say a word.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.666
-Where did she go?
-What the hell is going on?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.125
Let me show you a picture.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.250
Have you seen this man?

13:45.916 --> 13:49.333
His name is Simon Genz
and he's head of forensics.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.375
I haven't seen him before.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.875
What's he got to do with it?
Isn't he a policeman?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.291
Does the name Toke Bering mean anything?

13:56.375 --> 14:00.125
-Did Rosa mention a Toke Bering?
-I don't know anything.

14:00.208 --> 14:03.416
All I know is that Gustav
was standing there with chestnut men

14:03.500 --> 14:04.708
in the living room.

14:04.791 --> 14:07.000
She can't be that hard to find.

14:07.083 --> 14:10.583
-You have towers and surveillance--
-Your wife's phone was switched off.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.750
We can't trace the signal from it.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.833
But I promise that we're doing
absolutely everything we can.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.666
I told the Ministry of Justice.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.833
We're working with intelligence services
and everyone's looking.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.708
Do you know what she was wearing today?

14:31.041 --> 14:32.083
-Steen.
-Dad?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.708
He's asking about Mom's clothes.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.958
What was she wearing?

14:39.791 --> 14:41.625
Mom was wearing…

14:44.708 --> 14:46.416
She was wearing gray trousers.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.000
-The ones she wears at home.
-The sweatpants?

14:49.666 --> 14:51.875
-Yes.
-And her top?

14:55.708 --> 14:56.541
Brown.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.958
A brown knitted jumper.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.291
-And sneakers.
-Thank you.

15:04.916 --> 15:06.333
I'll be back in a sec.

15:20.666 --> 15:22.166
Dad, they found me, remember?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.041
Where is she?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.375
Is she alive?

16:25.333 --> 16:26.166
Come on inside.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.041
Kristine, are you here?

16:44.125 --> 16:44.958
It's Mom.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.208
Kristine, are you here?

16:50.375 --> 16:53.958
I bought the place around the time
you popped up in the media.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.125
Kristine, it's Mom.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.000
You'd just been made social minister.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.250
Imagine the irony of that.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.833
There you were, smiling.
Speaking for the children.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.666
The good thing is
the place is still relatively unchanged.

17:25.541 --> 17:29.958
There's the living room
where my foster dad watched sports on TV.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.208
Or whatever he was watching.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.041
The kitchen.

17:37.125 --> 17:41.666
My foster mom spent a lot of time there.
It was the family's favorite room.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.083
They were always in there.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.791
That's the bathroom.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.333
My foster mom took a lot of long baths.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.250
She'd had two children, which was rough.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.916
She needed to relax a lot.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.166
You're right. I lied back then.
I didn't know what I was doing.

18:08.541 --> 18:09.791
Yes, you did.

18:11.083 --> 18:14.333
-You knew exactly what you were doing.
-You're angry at me.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.708
Want to see the dining room?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.666
We hardly ever used it.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.666
Only when we had company.
And we have company today.

18:33.458 --> 18:34.583
Go on and take a seat.

18:36.625 --> 18:37.875
Come on, sit down.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.583
You're sitting there.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.541
I'd have invited my sister,
but sadly, she couldn't make it.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.750
But Naia could, so…

19:01.583 --> 19:02.916
Toke, please.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.083
Please, where is Kristine?

19:05.791 --> 19:07.958
Let's just do what we did back then.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.916
We'll sit and have a nice time.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.291
We'll chat for a bit and…

19:15.458 --> 19:17.666
You wanted to make a family.
Do you remember?

19:19.458 --> 19:20.291
A family.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.458
Here. Have some chestnuts.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.000
Let's see.

19:25.083 --> 19:28.416
That one's nice, and that's nice.

19:30.375 --> 19:34.000
It's important to sort of drill,
don't stab it.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.291
So, you killed all those people?

19:39.375 --> 19:40.291
All because of me?

19:41.291 --> 19:44.375
No, I saved those children.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.833
They're much better off now
without their useless moms.

19:50.125 --> 19:51.291
Come on.

19:56.541 --> 19:57.791
I don't know what you want.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.250
And I don't care.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.375
Tell me where my daughter is. Tell me!

20:03.458 --> 20:05.125
Or you'll stab me with that?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.333
Then you'll never know where she is.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.541
-Will you?
-Tell me!

20:11.958 --> 20:13.666
You're ruining the mood.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.250
Let's sing a song, okay?

20:16.666 --> 20:20.666
You can't sing, of course,
but we could sing "Chestnut Man."

20:20.750 --> 20:21.833
Do you remember it?

20:22.458 --> 20:23.291
Look.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.666
<i>Chestnut man</i>

20:26.750 --> 20:29.833
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Chestnut man</i>

20:30.541 --> 20:32.375
<i>Come on inside…</i>

20:34.208 --> 20:36.583
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>

20:38.208 --> 20:39.041
Louder!

20:39.125 --> 20:40.333
<i>For me today?</i>

20:40.416 --> 20:41.666
That's great. Keep going.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.166
<i>Thank you</i>

20:44.250 --> 20:45.083
Again.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.041
Together.

20:46.125 --> 20:50.000
<i>Chestnut man</i>
<i>Come on inside</i>

20:50.083 --> 20:52.291
<i>Chestnut man</i>

20:52.375 --> 20:54.541
-Sing it louder.
-<i>Inside…</i>

20:54.625 --> 20:56.000
Louder! I can't hear you.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.083
<i>Do you have some chestnuts…</i>

21:03.458 --> 21:04.708
She's good, right?

21:05.208 --> 21:08.333
Surprisingly good.
Where the hell did that go?

21:20.541 --> 21:21.375
Calm down.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.875
Let me show you
where my sister and I lived.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.458
-Nylander.
<i>-What's up?</i>

21:36.541 --> 21:38.166
<i>-Did you find it?</i>
-Find what?

21:38.250 --> 21:40.166
<i>The house. With the German newspapers.</i>

21:40.958 --> 21:43.333
We can't find it.
We have no leads to follow.

21:43.416 --> 21:44.250
<i>Where are you</i>?

21:44.916 --> 21:46.125
I'm still on Møn.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.000
I had an idea,
but now I can't find the bloody place.

21:50.791 --> 21:51.833
<i>What place?</i>

21:53.916 --> 21:55.250
I'll call you in a minute.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.166
<i>Hess.</i>

21:57.083 --> 21:57.916
<i>Hess!</i>

22:34.375 --> 22:36.333
I owe you a great deal of thanks.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.166
If it weren't for you,
I'd never have found my calling.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.000
So,

22:46.083 --> 22:48.000
there's always a silver lining, right?

22:50.541 --> 22:53.708
Don't worry, you're the last one, Rosa.
I'll do my very best with you.

22:54.708 --> 22:58.250
My best piece of advice
is to relax as much as you can.

22:59.333 --> 23:03.000
Remember that all of this
serves a higher purpose.

23:17.458 --> 23:18.666
Yes. Is something wrong?

23:22.666 --> 23:25.375
I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back later.

23:26.208 --> 23:29.250
Well, that sounds great. Sure. Bye.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.583
Let's start on the first one.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.625
Thulin!

25:32.791 --> 25:34.250
How did you find this place?

25:35.583 --> 25:36.416
Tell me!

25:37.833 --> 25:41.041
The bookmark.
Your sister by the chestnut tree.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.833
My bookmark?

25:44.958 --> 25:46.416
Who else knows where you are?

25:47.250 --> 25:48.500
Nobody.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.125
That's right. Nylander knows.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.541
I forgot about that.

26:10.208 --> 26:14.333
<i>-How far away are</i> <i>the local police?</i>
<i>-At least 10-12 minutes.</i>

26:36.666 --> 26:41.166
Genz, you're not getting away with it.
Everybody knows who you are.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.208
Thulin has nothing to do with it.
She's innocent.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.750
And I don't give a shit
what Rosa did back then.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.958
It's not her fault you ended up here.

26:52.041 --> 26:54.166
-Isn't it?
-She was just a kid!

26:54.250 --> 26:56.333
She was… You misunderstand everything.

26:56.416 --> 26:59.083
-It was her fault.
-She was just a child.

26:59.166 --> 27:02.875
Shut your mouth!
You don't understand anything.

27:02.958 --> 27:04.916
She was a kid.

27:05.750 --> 27:06.916
Just a child!

27:15.000 --> 27:17.166
Didn't your wife and daughter
burn to death?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.541
Why don't you join them?

27:33.291 --> 27:34.166
Come on.

27:36.041 --> 27:36.916
Come on.

28:12.916 --> 28:13.750
Fuck!

28:43.916 --> 28:47.541
Kristine… I heard him on the phone.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.833
Genz!

30:04.291 --> 30:05.875
Move to the corner!

30:12.333 --> 30:13.208
Come on!

30:18.208 --> 30:19.458
Come on, goddammit!

30:30.625 --> 30:31.500
Come on!

30:37.625 --> 30:38.791
Come over here!

30:38.875 --> 30:39.875
Rosa, come on.

30:46.708 --> 30:47.583
Come.

31:25.833 --> 31:30.333
Push! Hold it above your heart.
I'll be back.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.750
I'm a bit disappointed in you, Naia.

32:03.833 --> 32:06.583
You should acknowledge what I've done

32:06.666 --> 32:09.291
rather than try to constantly stop me.

32:09.375 --> 32:10.375
Do you hear me?

32:13.791 --> 32:15.000
But now, it's all done.

32:16.625 --> 32:19.833
The story of the Chestnut Man
will live on for years to come.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.666
I just need to figure out
what to do with you first.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.833
You have Le, and she needs a mother.

32:30.375 --> 32:31.458
Shut up!

32:50.833 --> 32:52.541
Calm down.

33:08.583 --> 33:13.333
Forget it. Give me one good reason
not to give Le a much better life.

33:13.416 --> 33:14.291
Genz!

33:17.125 --> 33:18.291
Come on out!

33:18.875 --> 33:20.375
Genz, get out of the car!

33:20.458 --> 33:21.291
Hess!

33:22.416 --> 33:25.291
Try to… You're touching… What the fuck?

33:26.625 --> 33:27.625
Don't move.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.250
Okay. Where's Rosa?

33:38.916 --> 33:41.750
She's safe
and looking forward to finding out

33:41.833 --> 33:43.625
what you did with her daughter.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.500
<i>-No.</i>
-Yes.

33:45.583 --> 33:48.041
Your saw cuts more than bones,
you sick bastard.

33:50.333 --> 33:51.166
Genz, it's over.

33:51.833 --> 33:54.208
-Shut up.
-<i>Come on out with your hands up!</i>

33:54.291 --> 33:55.625
Shut up!

34:36.833 --> 34:38.916
Thulin?

34:43.916 --> 34:45.166
Come here.

34:46.625 --> 34:47.791
Okay.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.875
Come here.

34:51.625 --> 34:53.000
I've got you.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.583
Okay.

34:58.416 --> 34:59.291
Okay.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.000
I've got you.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.208
Where is he?

35:15.125 --> 35:16.041
Where is he?

35:27.125 --> 35:27.958
Genz…

35:32.541 --> 35:33.416
Genz.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.750
Where's Kristine?

35:35.791 --> 35:37.333
Genz, where's Kristine?

35:39.833 --> 35:43.125
-Tell us where she is.
-Genz, come on.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.250
Where's Kristine?

36:13.250 --> 36:14.083
<i>Hello?</i>

36:15.708 --> 36:17.666
Hello, Toke? Are you there?

36:19.375 --> 36:20.333
I don't like this.

36:22.625 --> 36:24.250
You promised you'd call as soon…

36:49.833 --> 36:54.625
<i>The police were shocked to discover</i>
<i>that 44-year-old Simon Genz</i>

36:54.708 --> 36:57.708
<i>was the murderer</i>
<i>and the so-called "Chestnut Man."</i>

36:58.416 --> 37:02.083
<i>Genz, who was killed by the police when</i>
<i>they attempted to arrest him yesterday</i>,

37:02.166 --> 37:05.041
<i>had been head of the forensics centre.</i>

37:05.125 --> 37:09.083
<i>He also investigated the murders</i>
<i>he himself had committed.</i>

37:09.791 --> 37:13.375
<i>Police are now investigating whether Genz</i>
<i>was also behind the presumed murder</i>

37:13.458 --> 37:16.666
<i>of social minister</i>
<i>Rosa Hartung's daughter Kristine,</i>

37:16.750 --> 37:19.375
<i>who disappeared a year ago.</i>

37:19.458 --> 37:22.375
<i>Rosa Hartung was discharged</i>
<i>from the hospital this morning…</i>

37:25.541 --> 37:29.041
Are you cold?
Do you want me to turn up the heat?

37:29.125 --> 37:31.000
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

37:36.750 --> 37:40.083
Nylander will brief us when we get there.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.750
He's speaking to the German police.

37:43.708 --> 37:44.750
So…

37:53.750 --> 37:57.958
You do know that it's highly unlikely
that she's alive.

38:00.791 --> 38:02.541
If we find her at all.

38:26.458 --> 38:27.291
What's the word?

38:28.458 --> 38:31.541
The call made to Genz' phone last night
was linked to a tower

38:31.625 --> 38:34.125
an hour from the ferry,
close to the Polish border.

38:34.208 --> 38:38.541
They've found the house down there
and set up road blocks.

38:38.625 --> 38:42.083
-What kind of place is it?
-We know it's close to a village.

38:42.166 --> 38:45.250
A couple of witnesses
recognized the description of Genz' car.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.958
He visited often this past year.

38:47.041 --> 38:50.916
So, ever since
he bought the house for his sister.

38:57.125 --> 38:57.958
They insisted.

38:58.583 --> 39:01.708
When I refused,
the minister of justice called me.

39:01.791 --> 39:03.125
Do we know if she--

39:03.208 --> 39:06.083
Nobody's seen a child near the house.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.916
Most witnesses say
the sister lives there alone.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.125
We know that Genz was surveilling her.

39:23.041 --> 39:26.583
…<i>and campsite. Here's the weather report.</i>

39:26.666 --> 39:33.166
<i>Tomorrow's weather will be mixed,</i>
<i>clearing up on Wednesday and Thursday</i>

39:33.250 --> 39:37.250
<i>with sunny, dry weather.</i>
<i>The weather is brought to you by…</i>

40:24.500 --> 40:25.333
Hello.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.708
Did you report water damage?

40:29.458 --> 40:31.041
I don't speak German.

40:32.416 --> 40:33.750
Astrid Bering?

40:41.208 --> 40:42.166
Let me go!

40:42.250 --> 40:43.583
Don't move!

40:43.666 --> 40:46.083
-Let me go.
-Don't move!

40:46.166 --> 40:47.375
Let me go.

40:49.666 --> 40:52.208
Let her go. She can't breathe.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.291
Astrid, where's Kristine?

40:55.458 --> 40:57.208
-Is he dead?
-Yes.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.666
Where's Kristine?

41:02.333 --> 41:04.166
Tell her parents I did what I could.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.375
Downstairs.

41:28.958 --> 41:29.875
It's locked.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.666
What's happening?

42:45.875 --> 42:48.625
Steen, I can't take it.
I think we should leave now.

42:51.875 --> 42:53.291
-Unlock the car.
-Honey.

42:53.375 --> 42:55.916
-Honey.
-I can feel something's wrong.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.458
I want to go home.

45:24.125 --> 45:25.916
-Good morning.
-Mom.

45:48.041 --> 45:51.250
The management agreement
is signed, and everything's ready.

45:54.291 --> 45:55.958
So? Do you want me to tear it up?

45:56.833 --> 45:57.666
Yes, please.

45:59.166 --> 46:02.375
Would you look after this for me?

46:02.958 --> 46:03.791
Of course.

46:08.958 --> 46:11.125
<i>I promised Le</i>
<i>not to talk about work at home,</i>

46:11.208 --> 46:14.833
so Aksel ended up taking the phone from me

46:15.500 --> 46:18.416
and telling my new boss
that if it was so goddamn important

46:18.500 --> 46:19.708
he could write an email.

46:19.791 --> 46:20.625
Wow.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.833
How about you?
You're off to Budapest and then what?

46:25.916 --> 46:29.625
It's Bucharest. Straight to a hotel room,

46:29.708 --> 46:31.791
then briefings and meetings
during the week.

46:31.875 --> 46:35.333
We need to close a case,
and then a new case will be waiting.

46:39.250 --> 46:40.625
-Well.
-Yes.

46:44.625 --> 46:46.958
-Safe travels.
-Thanks. We…

46:49.333 --> 46:50.166
See you.

46:50.250 --> 46:52.000
I was wondering if…

46:55.208 --> 46:56.625
What the hell are you doing?

46:58.583 --> 47:00.791
-We…
-See you.

47:01.375 --> 47:02.208
Safe travels.

47:02.291 --> 47:03.125
Thank you.

47:14.708 --> 47:16.333
I forgot to give you something.

47:18.416 --> 47:19.291
It's from Le.

47:21.541 --> 47:22.583
From Le?

47:25.041 --> 47:27.041
-Tell her I said thank you.
-I will.

47:28.125 --> 47:29.166
Bye.

48:04.708 --> 48:08.500
Next week, I'll contact the authorities
about a compensation claim.

48:08.583 --> 48:12.375
In light of all the time you served
for a crime you didn't commit,

48:12.458 --> 48:15.666
we should be looking
at a considerable amount.

48:15.750 --> 48:16.708
Let's wait and see.

48:17.833 --> 48:19.458
Justice will be served.

48:19.541 --> 48:20.375
Congratulations.

48:21.125 --> 48:22.041
You're free to go.
