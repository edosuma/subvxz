WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.045
Crowd control,
before they kill that man.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.547
All right, everybody
back now!
We're not going anywhere.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.925
Back up,
or I'll knock you
on your ass.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.760
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:10.928 --> 00:11.803
Do you talk to
your sister?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.137
It's still hard for her.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.847
Look, I need to turn
the page on this too.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.809
Maybe you should've
thought of that before
you killed Dad.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.436
Nothing excuses
what she did.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.771
I'm not asking
you to forget.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.440
Would you
think about coming
out to visit me?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.401
Yes, I will come
visit you when I can.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.027
Flaco's dead.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.987
Help me!
Please! Please!

00:30.447 --> 00:32.532
We take this
to the grave,
just me and you.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.909
Um... I need help.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.286
I am so damn
proud of you, Kelly.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.371
Listen, uh,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.581
at the Christmas party...
There's some stuff
I'm dealing with,

00:40.749 --> 00:41.749
stuff I got to figure out.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.251
I hope it works out...
Whatever it is.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.037
Good morning.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.249
Morning. Wow.
What time is it?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.542
7:00.

01:26.003 --> 01:26.794
Oh, what do we got
going here?

01:26.962 --> 01:28.838
Uh, just a little
veggie scramble.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.089
Wow.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.885
There's the culprit.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.429
Did we kill this
whole thing last night?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.556
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.809
Wine... I don't know
why I do it.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.478
Ugh. Every time.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.938
Every... Every time what?

01:46.857 --> 01:49.150
I just get... Drunk.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.657
You don't have to worry.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.534
I'm not gonna tell
anybody at work.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.829
Um, it's not like I'm
gonna be embarrassed...

02:01.997 --> 02:04.081
Hey, don't explain.
We're on the same page.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.960
This is our thing.
Nobody else's.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.759
Enjoy your eggs,
and I'll see you
at work, okay?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.386
Okay.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.013
Hey, Peter.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.745
Hey. Yeah,
I know, Chief.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.372
It's just that
the classified ad,

02:44.540 --> 02:46.290
it runs today, and...

02:46.834 --> 02:49.001
I just need to make
back what I put into her.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.753
And I need my driveway.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.089
Okay, yeah.
I'll finish up
on the curb.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.515
She's so damn cold.
It just needs
a little extra.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.441
Could be worse.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.319
How?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.457
Just a little
fender bender,

03:28.625 --> 03:29.625
that's all.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.627
No big deal.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.213
Aw.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.924
How's the noodle?

03:37.092 --> 03:37.925
Hard as ever.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.427
That's...
That's what he said.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.972
Just a little
something from us.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.057
Oh, my... You guys.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.563
What is it?
Oh. Ha, ha!

03:50.731 --> 03:51.814
Added protection.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.900
Oh, I love it.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.027
Welcome back.
Thanks, Chief.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.194
Thanks, guys.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.995
I'm gonna tell him...

04:07.998 --> 04:09.206
Today.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.083
Great.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.058
Hey.
Morning.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.856
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61, police assist,

04:34.316 --> 04:37.151
4000 South Kildare
and West 44th.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.788
Abandoned truck.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.331
And there's something
funky inside.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.666
It's padlocked shut.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.709
Capp, grab the K-12.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.044
Got it.

04:56.004 --> 04:56.963
- Texas?
- Yeah.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.881
Came back stolen
from a minivan in...

04:59.967 --> 05:02.802
San Angelo.
Wherever the hell that is.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.805
Everyone quiet.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.189
Someone in there? Call out.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.276
I didn't hear
that before.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.669
Holy hell.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.771
We have
multiple victims...

05:56.565 --> 05:58.691
Women, men...

05:58.859 --> 06:00.109
Maybe 15 of them.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.695
They all look DOA,
but we need to check vitals.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
Damn it.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.699
There are children.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.372
Hey, Dawson!

06:23.550 --> 06:24.633
I know this is scary,
but if you come with me,

06:24.801 --> 06:25.801
we can help you.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.515
Me Ilamo Gabriela.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.350
Rosa.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.103
Toma.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.239
Dehydrated,
borderline hypothermic.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.741
Warmed her with
blankets, hot packs,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.618
and 200cc bolus
of warm fluids.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.828
No English.
Undocumented?

06:52.996 --> 06:55.039
Yeah, found her
in the back of an
abandoned smuggler's truck.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.582
How old?
Sixteen.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.459
Let's make sure
three is clear.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.752
Prep warm saline,
and heat up
some blankets.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.712
And someone alert ICE.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.547
Wait, do we have to
call immigration
right away?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.257
She's been through enough.
Protocol.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.885
No! No, no, no, no!

07:11.723 --> 07:13.432
Can... Can we have
a quick moment?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.809
Quickly.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.023
No.

07:23.985 --> 07:24.860
Okay?
Okay.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.364
Okay.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.972
You need something?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.142
Nah, I'm all good.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.897
Hey, no one's heard
from Cruz, huh?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.277
Shouldn't you be
at work?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.821
I traded shifts.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.457
I registered for class
today over at Truman.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.318
I'll show it to you
another time.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.614
Hey.
Hey.

09:33.782 --> 09:34.782
How'd it go?

09:34.950 --> 09:35.991
With...

09:36.159 --> 09:37.368
Boden.
Yeah...

09:37.535 --> 09:39.536
Yeah... No...
'Cause here's the deal.

09:39.955 --> 09:40.788
Yeah.
On the last call,

09:40.956 --> 09:41.956
I ripped off that lock

09:42.123 --> 09:43.916
like it was bolted
on with paper clips.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.751
No pain, nothin'.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.088
I moved back in
because you said
you talked to Boden.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.265
What's going on?
Um...

10:00.517 --> 10:03.060
Have you heard from
that Rick character?

10:04.187 --> 10:05.271
No.
Who's he?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.065
This lawyer
who's working with Mom.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.526
He asked me
about Mom's trial

10:10.694 --> 10:13.195
and specifically
about the house key.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.907
Well, what?
What about it?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.701
I don't know where
he was going with it

10:18.868 --> 10:20.953
because I told him
that was

10:21.121 --> 10:23.122
your business
and to talk to you
about it.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.374
I'm just giving you
the heads up
that this guy

10:25.542 --> 10:27.001
might be trying to
contact you,

10:27.168 --> 10:29.003
and it might be
about the key.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.171
Okay.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.215
I appreciate it.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.970
I gotta get going.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.057
Hey, Christie.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.199
The C-5 vertebra.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.202
Fracture.
That's what
the doctor said.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.915
How long ago
was this exam?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.044
You don't want to know.

11:12.547 --> 11:13.672
Okay.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.259
This doctor may be
a little eager

11:17.427 --> 11:18.594
to get you
under the knife.

11:19.220 --> 11:19.970
Yeah?
Yeah.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.349
'Cause they're not
gonna know anything
until they do an MRI.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.559
We are not gonna
go worst-case right now.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.270
Gonna let the CFD medical

11:28.438 --> 11:30.481
give a fully
informed diagnosis.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.110
Chief, I don't ask
for a lot of favors.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.821
But since I feel
fine 90% of the time,

11:37.989 --> 11:39.031
I'd like to stay on squad

11:39.199 --> 11:40.616
while this whole thing
runs its course.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.701
In the meantime,
I'll set up

11:42.869 --> 11:43.827
an appointment
for after shift.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.205
I'll get in there
the next opening they got.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.090
What's going on?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.552
Off duty till
the results come in.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.824
So, when's
the appointment?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.325
Later today.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.620
And then...
How long did
the first doctor

12:26.788 --> 12:27.913
say that you'd be out?

12:28.623 --> 12:29.998
Six months.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.544
You know,

12:33.711 --> 12:35.003
I was a gymnast growing up.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.339
Knew you must have got your
flexibility from somewhere.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.882
And after I placed
in Nationals,

12:39.050 --> 12:41.635
I got invited to
the Olympic trials.
Weekend before

12:42.804 --> 12:44.596
I took my bike

12:45.140 --> 12:46.515
down to the lake,

12:46.683 --> 12:48.058
and this cab door opens up,

12:48.226 --> 12:50.394
and there you go.
Ow.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.439
But, I was up
and walking
two months later.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.691
Were you ever
a gymnast again?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.734
No...

12:58.361 --> 13:00.612
Probably not the best
pep talk

13:00.780 --> 13:02.698
I could have given.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.117
Okay.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.453
Let me ask you this.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.039
Does, um, being on squad

13:11.207 --> 13:13.834
involve having to
stick a full twisting
double layout?

13:14.502 --> 13:15.544
Yes.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.504
Oh!

13:17.672 --> 13:19.673
Well, you're gonna be fine.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.470
When are you
leaving for Madrid?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.264
Hmm.
Tuesday.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.517
I can push it.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.728
No, no, no.
No, do your thing.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.690
Tell me you're gonna
come visit me.
Yes.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.610
Once I get my back
squared away.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.655
I'm calling it
right now.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.575
Two months. Max.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.994
All right.
I'll take that.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.465
Thought you were out
for the shift.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.635
Well, yeah, I resolved
things a little bit early.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.678
Okay if I jump in?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.681
Suit up.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.268
What happened
to your hand?

14:13.728 --> 14:15.020
Nothing.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.859
Yeah. Yeah,
I understand.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.570
And... And I'm so sorry
for your loss.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.906
Well, please let me know
what happens,

14:26.074 --> 14:28.325
and, uh, I'll keep a good
thought for Rosa.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.788
Sí. Okay.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.706
Adiós.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.711
Rosa's uncle...

14:39.879 --> 14:41.922
He hasn't been able
to get to the hospital
to see her.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.674
She getting deported?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.092
I don't know yet.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.593
I can't imagine
they would, though,

14:46.761 --> 14:47.761
with everything
she's been through.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.805
Where are her parents?

14:50.640 --> 14:51.974
They were in the back
of that trailer.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.475
Oh, man.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.893
Well...

14:55.895 --> 14:57.771
Let me know
if I can help
in any way.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.315
Can I talk to you
for a second?

15:00.483 --> 15:03.402
Delivery for a
Gabriela Dawson?

15:04.821 --> 15:07.823
- Oh... Great.
- No card.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.119
Doth milady have a
secret admirer, perchance?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.834
Engine 51, Truck 81,

15:19.002 --> 15:21.878
Squad 3, Ambulance 61,
Battalion 25.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.339
Aircraft down,
Bosworth and Waveland.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.552
This is 81.
We're gonna need

15:28.720 --> 15:31.430
two more ambulances to
north Bosworth and Waveland.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.723
Guys, fan out!

15:32.890 --> 15:33.849
Herrmann, with me.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.058
We'll take that car.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.312
You guys okay?

15:38.479 --> 15:39.896
Yeah, yeah.
We're fine, we're fine.
Check the driver.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.231
My husband!

15:41.399 --> 15:42.608
How's my husband?

15:42.775 --> 15:43.650
Okay, stay right there.
Stay calm.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.695
Hey... He's gone, man.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.459
Sir, just stay
where you are.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.502
We'll take care of you.
No, I don't need
that thing.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.712
Just let me out of here.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.631
Get him out.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.007
All right, let's go.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.675
Nice and easy.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.471
How old are you, sir?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.640
85, and don't blame
this on my age.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.767
The tower fed me
the wrong coordinates.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.102
It's not my fault I
landed short of the runway.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.354
Short of the runway?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.439
You're 5 miles from
the closest airport.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.316
Well, take it up
with the FAA.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.734
I was just following the...

16:26.694 --> 16:28.111
Oh, no. No, no.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.655
I thought I missed
that car.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.615
Don't look that way.
Come with me.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.119
Hey, we gotta pull
her out headfirst.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.245
You have clearance
on her feet?

16:37.413 --> 16:38.580
Nah, I'm just out
of reach.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.499
I gotta hit it from
another angle.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.171
Just put this around
your head to protect you.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.355
Mills! With me!

17:05.983 --> 17:07.192
Ma'am?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.194
This is Casey.
We're gonna need a medic.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.655
61, on our way.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.365
Mills! Let's go!
Yeah.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.795
Weak pulse.

17:26.963 --> 17:27.671
A lot of blood outside.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.839
We got to move him.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.674
Ready?
Nice and smooth.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.342
One, two, three.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.388
Okay, roll him over.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.393
Whoa!

17:41.561 --> 17:43.478
In my bag.
Abdominal trauma pads.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.855
How many?
All of 'em.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.106
Okay.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.482
The glass broke through
his abdominal wall.

17:47.650 --> 17:48.692
We need to pack him
right here

17:48.860 --> 17:49.901
before he bleeds out
all over the place.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.319
Here.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.283
Press down,
not too hard.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.784
There might
still be glass.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.622
Hold the dressing
right here.
Keep the wound covered.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.957
That's good.
A hand here. Pressure.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.794
Let's get him on the board.
All right.

18:08.671 --> 18:09.880
Ready.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.966
Casey, as we lift him,
keep your hand here,

18:13.134 --> 18:14.259
or else this is gonna
be a recovery.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.385
You got it?
Copy.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.678
All right.
Let's get him up.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.430
Lift.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.476
All right, go...
Push, come on.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.810
Go!

18:23.978 --> 18:25.771
Come on! Come on.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.855
For the love of Pete,
my six-year-old's

18:27.023 --> 18:29.191
got more upper
body strength than you two.
Herrmann...

18:29.358 --> 18:30.567
Is the parking brake on?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.116
Okay, guys. Come on,
just push, then.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.451
Go.
Got it?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.744
Yeah.
You sure?

18:40.912 --> 18:41.870
I think I got it.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.163
Okay.
Go.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.584
Sorry it didn't
work out, man.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.044
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
Listen, I want to
thank you
for helping me

18:57.345 --> 18:59.054
get my head straight over
that Flaco thing.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.016
Are you back to work?

19:03.601 --> 19:04.726
I am.
Good.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.269
Welcome back.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.064
But you and me, we never
talk about that again.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.817
Not another word. Clear?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.735
Yeah.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.112
Sorry, Lieutenant.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.706
Hey, you know what's wild?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.250
I just now realized

19:28.417 --> 19:31.378
that your last name
and Tom Cruise's
last name

19:31.546 --> 19:33.463
are pronounced
exactly the same.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.633
People ever misspell
it like his

19:36.801 --> 19:37.968
in the mail or whatever?

19:39.971 --> 19:41.429
Not really.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.019
Are you okay, buddy?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.523
You've really been off
your game lately.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.653
Do you need to talk
to someone?

19:59.407 --> 20:00.824
I'm your friend.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.244
You can tell
me anything.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.005
Hey. Yo, Alfredo sauce.
Made it from scratch.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.299
I thought we had
an agreement about
the other night.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.593
And now, suddenly, flowers?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.970
Delivered to me
in front of everyone?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.847
That is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.265
I don't know,
maybe this is my fault.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.892
Maybe I'm missing
something here.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.894
But what exactly happened
to "This is our thing.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.146
"Nobody else's"?
I didn't send them.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.025
Hey.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.193
Found this out front.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.278
Delivery guy must have
dropped it.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.864
The flowers are actually
for the both of you.

20:41.532 --> 20:44.492
Some lady wanted to
thank you for saving her,

20:44.660 --> 20:46.661
"Even though you had
to drug my dog."

20:48.289 --> 20:50.916
Yeah, great. Thanks.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.709
You're welcome.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.303
Boo.

21:03.846 --> 21:04.804
Royce.

21:05.723 --> 21:06.640
What are you doing here?

21:06.807 --> 21:08.683
Ah, I just cleared some
stuff from my schedule.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.810
Mmm. Hi.
Hi.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.688
Oh. Didn't realize
you had a guest.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.233
Dr. Kessman,
this is my...

21:18.569 --> 21:21.112
Girlfriend, Renee.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.906
It's good that you
could make it.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.908
So today's CT scan shows

21:25.076 --> 21:27.702
that the hairline
fracture on your C-5 here

21:27.870 --> 21:29.871
extends further than
we thought.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.539
So surgery?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.916
Yeah, as soon as possible.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.835
And the recovery time,
that's the same six months?

21:36.671 --> 21:37.545
Unfortunately not.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.297
Um, forget whatever
you were told before.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.465
It's a year
at best.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.760
Look, some guys who
come in here on the job,

21:43.928 --> 21:45.470
they're rolled out in the
chair they're gonna live in

21:45.638 --> 21:47.097
the rest of their lives.
You're lucky.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.475
Everything I see tells me
you should make
a full recovery.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.893
A year?

21:52.853 --> 21:55.855
A year if you hope
to return to squad.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.527
I'll be honest,
I've never seen anyone
return to full duty

22:00.695 --> 22:01.987
after this surgery.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.531
Much sooner, though,
four or five months,

22:04.699 --> 22:07.242
you can come back in an
administrative capacity.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.035
So you may want to
set your sights on that.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.912
That's much more realistic.

22:11.914 --> 22:12.998
I'll give you two a minute.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.639
Uh-oh, looks like someone's

22:29.807 --> 22:31.683
still dropping their
laundry off at Mom's house.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.644
Fluff-and-fold.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.731
Not that
she hasn't offered,
though.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.940
Oh.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.986
Yeah, um...

22:44.321 --> 22:46.406
So that was kind of weird,
what happened earlier.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.658
Which part? Oh!

22:48.826 --> 22:50.744
Oh, you mean
the whole thing.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.331
Look, I was out of line.
I should have known...

22:55.499 --> 22:56.624
Yeah, well, at least now
you know

22:56.792 --> 22:58.418
I mean what I say.
I know.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.919
And I should have
known that.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.713
And I still want
to apologize.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.548
Oh. Hey, Chief.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.803
Briefing room, everybody.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.481
As you can imagine,
Kelly is still processing
all of this.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.234
I'd give him a little
time before you call him.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.197
And there is no reason that,
before or after the surgery,

23:27.990 --> 23:29.783
Kelly shouldn't be
in this house,

23:30.910 --> 23:33.912
feeling at home
and around his family.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.707
So will you all
encourage him
to do that?

23:39.877 --> 23:41.795
Look... There is no denying

23:41.962 --> 23:43.588
we are a good man down.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.424
We do not have
the luxury to act like it.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.635
So the upside of this...

23:48.803 --> 23:50.553
It is a stark reminder.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.890
Injuries do not get swept
under the rug on this job.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.226
Nor do they get
self-diagnosed

23:56.393 --> 23:59.020
or self-medicated,
'cause what is that?

24:00.815 --> 24:01.856
Pride,

24:03.317 --> 24:05.276
friendship, stubbornness,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.571
fear whatever the reason,
it isn't good enough
to hide an injury.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.740
Kelly dodged a bullet
on this one.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.742
So did the people he helped
rescue this past month.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.246
'Cause it could have gone
real bad, for him
and for them,

24:16.831 --> 24:18.289
real quick.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.795
Hey, Ernesto.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.672
I'm sorry to
bother you like this.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.090
No, that's no problem
at all.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.050
I'm so sorry about what you
and Rosa are going through.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.885
They're deporting her.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.638
I don't
even know what to say.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.140
Did they
give you a reason?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.808
They found out she was 16.

24:37.393 --> 24:38.685
A year younger,
she would have been eligible

24:38.853 --> 24:40.311
for refugee status.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.651
What's this?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.069
To help her get home.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.281
Immigration will only
take her to the border.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.868
Can you please
get it to her?

24:59.123 --> 25:02.667
Ambulance 61,
Truck 81. Pulmonary distress.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.336
2500 West Ogden
and Roosevelt.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.469
It usually doesn't take this
long to go back to normal.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.679
Sir, when you're in
this kind of pain,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.639
you can't just ignore
it and hope it goes away.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.433
Yeah, I know, but I hate
going to see the doctor.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.601
My health care
plan's a joke.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.394
Yeah, we work
for the city too, coach.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.520
You're preaching
to the choir.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.316
Travis?
Heart rate's at 185.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.610
He's in V-tach.
BP's 70 over 50.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.486
We don't have time
for the drive.
We gotta do this here.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.821
All right, Travis,
change of plans.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.573
We're gonna need you
to lie down, all right?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.242
All right,
I'm gonna start an IV.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.244
So I just need you to
stay as still as possible,
all right?

25:38.412 --> 25:39.454
Why? What's happening?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.664
Well,
we gotta get you back
into rhythm.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.083
We're just gonna apply some
electricity to your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.668
You're gonna shock me?

25:45.836 --> 25:46.836
I don't know... What,
is that gonna hurt?

25:47.004 --> 25:48.796
A lot less than the full
cardiac arrest

25:48.964 --> 25:51.674
you're about to have.
You just have to
trust us, Travis.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.635
Okay, pushing 5 mils
of Diazepam.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.386
Shocking at 100.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.722
Stand back. Clear.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.811
Oh, God, it's done.
It's done.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.230
Almost. No, no, no.
It's done.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.397
Travis, almost. Almost.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.566
We gotta do it again,
all right? You have
a stubborn heart.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.235
Come on, there's gotta be
something else you can do.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.778
This is it, Travis.
We have to.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.738
You heard coach...
He said he didn't want it!

26:13.906 --> 26:15.490
Shocking at 200.

26:15.658 --> 26:16.824
Stand back.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.660
Clear!

26:20.496 --> 26:22.038
Please no more.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.749
Please... No more.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.209
Please.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.961
All right, one more time.
I'm not gonna hold on.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.420
Just get me
to the hospital.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.923
Travis, I'm sorry.
You just gotta trust us,
okay?

26:33.842 --> 26:36.135
Okay, shocking
at 300.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.387
Stand back.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.055
Clear!

26:42.726 --> 26:44.727
Otis, I need
chest compressions!

26:44.895 --> 26:46.271
Coach! Is he all right?

26:46.438 --> 26:47.814
No.
You're killing him!

26:47.982 --> 26:48.940
Hey, step back, man.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.483
Hey, you hear me? Move back!

26:50.651 --> 26:51.734
Mills! Back off.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.319
Kid just wants to know
what's going on.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.158
Stop compressions.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.286
Damn it! Still in V-tach.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.621
All right,
pushing 150 mils
of amiodarone.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.873
Stand back, shocking at 360.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.458
Clear.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.837
Come on.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.088
We got him.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.133
Okay, we need a lift, guys.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.379
Hi.
Oh, hey.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.589
Hi.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.591
You must be, uh...
Yeah, I'm Renee.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.926
Renee, of course.
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.428
You are Shay.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.680
I have heard
amazing things
about you.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.099
Yeah, you too.
Uh, is he here?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.894
Yeah, he is just up
taking a shower right now.

28:08.771 --> 28:09.771
How's he doing?

28:10.898 --> 28:12.065
Trying to figure it out.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.234
Yeah. I was worried.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.402
I've been trying to
get a hold of him.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.863
He's definitely not up
for taking phone calls.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.533
Okay, yeah,
I'll just have him

28:22.701 --> 28:23.701
download me on it later.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.661
Okay. Um, you know what?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.580
There's some extra coffee
in there, if you'd like.

28:27.748 --> 28:30.917
Thanks. So when do you
leave for Madrid?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.921
In a couple days.
Oh, that sucks.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.840
He's been telling me you
guys have really hit it off.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.135
Who knows
what the future holds?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.722
Well, you shouldn't worry.
I mean...

28:44.890 --> 28:46.557
If you haven't
figured it out already,

28:46.725 --> 28:48.601
he's basically
indestructible, and...

28:50.813 --> 28:53.439
I'll be here to
take care of him, so

28:54.483 --> 28:56.234
don't you worry
about a thing.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.029
It was nice to meet you.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.948
You too.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.290
Idiot.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.335
Hey, I'm Gabriela Dawson.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.838
I'm one of the paramedics
who responded.
Okay.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.507
Uh, do you think I could
talk to her for a second,

29:19.675 --> 29:20.675
just to see how she's doing?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.303
No sweat.
Thank you.

29:33.397 --> 29:34.689
Hola, Rosa.

29:34.857 --> 29:35.940
Gabriela.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.467
Solo usted.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.071
My greatest achievement.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.324
You look so handsome.
I'm so proud of you.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.410
It's good seeing you, Mom.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.370
Rick Savrinn.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.956
I've heard so many good
things about you, Matt.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.625
Rick.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.003
Um...

30:40.881 --> 30:42.465
So what's going on?

30:42.633 --> 30:43.633
How are things?

30:44.092 --> 30:45.009
You tell me.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.137
Looks like there's
something you guys
want to talk about.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.890
I just want to tell you
how grateful I am

30:51.058 --> 30:52.975
that you're gonna
speak up at the hearing.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.811
I'm sure
you understand.
Yeah, I do.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.648
So I was talking to Rick,

30:58.815 --> 31:01.108
and he brought up
a really good point.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.735
I know it's
a difficult subject,

31:02.903 --> 31:04.612
but if we could just
talk it out,

31:05.113 --> 31:06.989
and then we can decide

31:07.157 --> 31:09.784
whether or not to bring
it up in the hearing.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.370
The house key.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.622
That's right.
See, I've talked
to an attorney.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.791
And he said that...
You're not an attorney?

31:17.334 --> 31:18.334
No.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.545
I'm just a friend
and advisor to your mom.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.590
I met Rick through
the pen pal program,

31:25.008 --> 31:27.260
but he has consulted
an attorney.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.769
All right,
so what about it?

31:37.729 --> 31:39.605
Imagine I'm the parole board.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.816
Just tell me what happened.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.035
I left the key
to my dad's house

31:53.203 --> 31:54.787
out on the counter.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.748
My mom took it.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.836
That's how she got into
his house at 3:00 a.m.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.464
And then she shot
and killed him.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.010
And how did
that make you feel?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.223
Well...

32:14.391 --> 32:15.391
Guilty.

32:17.311 --> 32:19.061
Every time
I replay that day,

32:19.229 --> 32:21.063
I wonder if my dad
would still be alive

32:21.231 --> 32:23.899
if I hadn't been
so careless with that key.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.736
I'll ask you what you
were asked 15 years ago.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.906
Is there a part of you
that left that key out
intentionally

32:31.074 --> 32:32.867
because you were angry
at your dad

32:33.035 --> 32:34.410
for the way he was
treating your mom,

32:34.578 --> 32:36.162
and you wanted him
to pay for it?

32:40.125 --> 32:42.585
Is this really what
you want to hear, Mom?
No, this is not about blame.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.253
We're not retrying
the case.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.921
This is about sympathy
for you.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.923
For your mom.
That's enough, Rick.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.133
This could go so...
That's enough!

32:49.301 --> 32:50.343
Sweetheart.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.386
Just forget
I said anything.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.097
You don't have
to say a word.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.351
It's gonna be enough
for me just to look over

32:59.019 --> 33:00.686
and see your face...

33:02.773 --> 33:06.025
The one person who's
never turned his back
on me in this world.

33:06.193 --> 33:06.942
Yeah, I gotta go.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.153
I love you so much.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.452
Yeah, fine.

33:17.954 --> 33:18.871
Hey, Chief.

33:19.039 --> 33:19.997
I just wanted to
let you know

33:20.165 --> 33:21.290
I'm selling that limo
off to a scrapyard.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.542
It'll be off the curb
by end of shift.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.044
How much?

33:27.089 --> 33:28.506
200 clams.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.926
I got another option
for you.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.136
We're due to run
a vehicle drill.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.347
I got a budget of $800.
It's yours,

33:36.890 --> 33:38.974
if you can get it towed
to the academy.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.646
Ah, Chief, man, all right!

33:45.023 --> 33:47.191
All right.
Hey, Mills, um...

33:47.359 --> 33:49.110
My office, real quick.

33:49.653 --> 33:50.611
Now or...

33:50.779 --> 33:52.113
You guys need a minute?

33:53.156 --> 33:54.240
Now.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.453
Doing a good job, Mills.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.205
Thank you, Chief.
But you're still in your

34:01.373 --> 34:03.124
probationary period, right?

34:03.959 --> 34:06.210
Yeah.
Still on the outside
looking in.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.295
Any mistakes,
you can get
dinged anytime.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.631
You know the deal.
Yeah.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.049
Yeah, I do.

34:12.843 --> 34:14.051
Can I give you
a word of advice?

34:16.304 --> 34:19.014
Keep your personal life
on hold.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.225
Devote everything
to your training.

34:21.685 --> 34:22.643
When you get
on the other side,

34:22.811 --> 34:24.937
then you can worry
about complications,
you know...

34:26.356 --> 34:27.982
Yeah. You're right.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.526
Yeah, I am a novice
in this business.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.987
But every time that I
walk through that door,

34:33.155 --> 34:34.155
I am all ears.

34:34.698 --> 34:35.948
Whatever your orders,
I'm on it.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.575
I mean, to the word.
Good.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.243
But...

34:40.120 --> 34:42.121
When it comes to
my personal life.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.206
My personal relationships,

34:45.333 --> 34:46.500
I'm not a novice.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.046
With all due respect,
Chief,

34:51.214 --> 34:52.256
that's my business.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.553
Then let me be
a little more direct.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.432
Sit down.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.061
Yes, sir.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.398
Young man like yourself,

35:09.983 --> 35:11.484
a few months in.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.029
Be real easy for you
to get a reputation

35:15.989 --> 35:17.823
as some kid more concerned
with chasing ass

35:18.658 --> 35:20.367
than he is with
mastering his job.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.537
Kelly Severide...

35:23.705 --> 35:24.747
I'm pretty sure
he's worked his way

35:24.915 --> 35:26.123
halfway through
Chicago right now.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.835
But those first two years
as a candidate,

35:30.003 --> 35:32.922
he did not look sideways

35:34.007 --> 35:35.883
at a woman that
he was working with.

35:41.431 --> 35:42.848
He put in the hours,

35:44.226 --> 35:45.810
mastered his craft.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.145
So what I'm saying is,
Peter Mills,

35:48.313 --> 35:50.022
maybe you should
get there first,

35:50.190 --> 35:52.441
'cause that way, people
in positions of power,

35:52.609 --> 35:55.694
people like me,
can reach down
and pick you up

35:55.862 --> 35:57.196
to the next level.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.739
Yeah, Chief, there...
There has to be...

35:58.907 --> 35:59.990
Dismissed.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.008
Morning.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.927
Good morning.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.596
Can I... Oh. Thanks.

36:22.764 --> 36:23.848
Yeah.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.475
Uh, hey, I might just
take you up on your offer

36:26.643 --> 36:28.853
to help me out with
that Rosa situation.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.771
Sure. Of course.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.481
Thank you.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.900
Actually been meaning
to talk to you.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.069
Oh, okay.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.488
Um...

36:42.200 --> 36:43.325
I've been dealing
with something,

36:43.493 --> 36:45.744
and the whole
situation's a bit...

36:47.122 --> 36:49.164
Well, embarrassing's
not the right word.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.084
But I realize I've been
a bit distant recently

36:52.252 --> 36:54.211
because of what's going on.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.171
And so what's going on is

36:56.339 --> 36:58.382
my mom is up for parole,

36:58.550 --> 37:01.343
and I'm trying to
help her get out.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.305
I just didn't want you
to think I was blowing
you off or anything.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.643
I... I thought that you
were dealing with Hallie
and all that.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.563
No, that's been over
for a while.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.815
Oh.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.819
So, uh...

37:20.196 --> 37:21.697
How can I help
with Rosa?

37:26.161 --> 37:28.078
Well, I've...
I've been written up twice,

37:28.246 --> 37:31.415
so I've got a bit
of a credibility issue

37:31.583 --> 37:32.666
with the Chief, and, uh...

37:36.171 --> 37:38.756
This is really big,
what I'm about to
ask you.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.425
So only if you
really want to do it.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.596
Misspoke?
Yeah, Chief. At the scene.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.306
Rosa told me
she was turning 16,

37:47.474 --> 37:49.475
and when I was
at the hospital,

37:49.643 --> 37:51.143
I mistakenly told
the ER doctor

37:51.311 --> 37:52.645
that she was 16,

37:52.812 --> 37:55.356
and somehow,
that became gospel.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.816
I don't know
a lot of Spanish, Chief,

37:57.984 --> 37:59.443
but I heard
Rosa say it, too.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.613
Me estoy convirtiendo
dieciseis.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.657
This is significant how?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.159
Since Rosa's really 15,

38:07.327 --> 38:09.328
she qualifies for
temporary refugee status

38:09.496 --> 38:11.872
but only if there are
other special circumstances.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.999
If Rosa agrees to
give information

38:14.167 --> 38:15.209
against those who
smuggled her,

38:15.377 --> 38:18.045
that would be enough to
give her a temporary "U" visa

38:18.213 --> 38:19.588
as the smuggling case
is being investigated.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.924
And since her closest
relative, her Uncle Ernesto,

38:22.092 --> 38:23.008
lives here in Chicago,

38:23.760 --> 38:25.302
she could live with him

38:25.470 --> 38:28.681
while she applies
for the I-130
for permanent residence.

38:37.607 --> 38:38.899
Okay, bring her in.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.116
Rosa!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.163
Thank you.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.000
You got it.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.338
Hey.

39:01.798 --> 39:02.923
Kelly.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.093
Tonight?
I'll be there.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.182
Mills!

39:12.892 --> 39:13.809
Unless you want to
get knee-capped,

39:13.977 --> 39:14.935
I'd get away
from that bumper.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.270
That thing goes up,

39:16.438 --> 39:17.354
it's gonna blow
like a cannon.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.731
It's gonna take
you right with it.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.691
Otis, get a hose
in that cab.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.693
Keep that fire from
making it to the back.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.404
Hood's open!

39:25.572 --> 39:27.197
Need CO2 on that block.
We're losing time.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.210
Fire's out.

39:40.628 --> 39:41.670
Come on, let's move!

39:44.007 --> 39:45.382
And... Time.

39:46.676 --> 39:47.885
3:47.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.136
Not bad.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.141
Herrmann!

39:55.143 --> 39:57.728
First time I have
sex in six months,

39:58.980 --> 40:00.064
Cindy's pregnant again.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.066
What's that, like, four?

40:02.984 --> 40:03.984
God.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.070
Carry on.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.840
Hey.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.593
Hell of a day, huh?

40:29.761 --> 40:30.886
Yeah.

40:33.848 --> 40:34.848
Tell you what.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.767
After surgery,

40:37.352 --> 40:38.685
forget rehab.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.979
Park it down at the house.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.898
I'll put you through
truck drills.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.110
We'll make a firefighter
out of you yet.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.904
Yeah, about that. Listen...

40:49.072 --> 40:50.906
Just to let you know first.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.784
The girl I'm dating, Renee,

40:53.952 --> 40:56.078
she's transferring to
Madrid for her job

40:56.913 --> 40:58.330
and found a great
rehab unit.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.041
Oh, great.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.668
How long you staying?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.003
I'm moving there.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.763
You're messing with me.

41:15.557 --> 41:16.765
I'm not.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.143
Bought my plane ticket
an hour ago.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.278
Well...

41:30.989 --> 41:32.489
I guess

41:33.116 --> 41:34.408
cheers to that then.
