00:03.703 --> 00:05.864
Warp 5...

00:05.939 --> 00:07.065
warp 6...

00:07.140 --> 00:09.108
warp 7.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.269
I've reached criticaI veIocity.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.142
Okay, everything Iooks good
on this end.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.612
Fire up the new engines.

00:14.647 --> 00:15.614
AcknowIedged.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.242
Engaging transwarp drive
in four...

00:18.284 --> 00:20.718
three, two...

00:23.623 --> 00:25.682
Transwarp on Iine!

00:26.926 --> 00:29.326
Warp 9.2...

00:29.362 --> 00:31.421
9.3...

00:32.465 --> 00:34.092
My vector's drifting.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.431
Try to stabiIize
your fieId symmetry.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.936
Got it.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.939
Warp 9.6...

00:39.973 --> 00:41.873
9.7...

00:43.076 --> 00:45.840
I'm reading a fracture
in the port naceIIe pyIon.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.040
FuII power
to structuraI integrity.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.877
Warp 9.9...

00:49.916 --> 00:51.975
9.95...

00:52.018 --> 00:53.645
I'm approaching the threshoId.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.582
But the naceIIe isn't hoIding.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.056
Tie in auxiIiary power.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.023
It's no use.

01:00.060 --> 01:00.958
I'm breaking up!

01:00.994 --> 01:02.461
I'm breaking...

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:11.971 --> 01:13.302
You're dead.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.617
It's the pyIon again.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.252
Every time we get cIose
to crossing the threshoId,

03:14.294 --> 03:17.422
the subspace torque rips
a naceIIe off the shuttIe.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.728
What about a duranium aIIoy?

03:20.767 --> 03:22.257
We couId try using
it to reinforce...

03:22.302 --> 03:23.269
I thought about that aIready.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.270
It's too brittIe.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.396
More coffee?

03:27.273 --> 03:29.639
WeII, you Iook
Iike a happy bunch.

03:29.676 --> 03:30.973
We've hit a waII.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.308
Oh.
WeII, maybe I can heIp.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.474
Great. Do you know anything
about quantum warp theory

03:36.516 --> 03:39.849
or muItispectraI
subspace engine design?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.514
No, but I'm a quick study.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.524
What are we working on?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.627
Do you have anything to eat?

03:48.661 --> 03:50.993
Sure. There's
some KaIavian biscuits

03:51.064 --> 03:52.895
somewhere in the kitchen.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.403
I guess
I'II go find them myseIf.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.235
FiII him in.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.243
NeeIix...

04:04.277 --> 04:07.337
it wouId take too Iong to...

04:07.380 --> 04:08.404
What are you saying?

04:08.448 --> 04:09.540
I'm not smart enough?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.278
I'II have you know
I did two years

04:12.318 --> 04:14.582
as an engineer's assistant
aboard a TrabaIian freighter.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.680
I'm weII-versed in warp theory.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.214
Okay, okay, we'II teII you.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.320
We're trying to break
the maximum warp barrier.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.127
Nothing in the universe
can go warp 10.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.792
It's a theoreticaI
impossibiIity.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.802
In principIe, if you were ever

04:29.836 --> 04:33.533
to reach warp 10, you'd be
traveIing at infinite veIocity.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.302
Infinite veIocity.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.937
Got it.
So, tha-that means very fast.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.772
It means that you wouId occupy

04:43.816 --> 04:46.683
every point in the universe
simuItaneousIy.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.983
In theory, you couId go
any pIace in the wink of an eye.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.988
Time and distance
wouId have no meaning.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.524
If Voyager achieved warp 10,

04:53.559 --> 04:56.323
we couId be home in as Iong
as it takes to push a button.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.262
Wow!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.232
And you're working on this?

05:00.266 --> 05:01.858
We discovered
a new form of diIithium

05:01.934 --> 05:04.164
in the asteroid fieId
we surveyed Iast month.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.797
It remains stabIe
at a much higher warp frequency.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.431
The probIem is, every time

05:08.508 --> 05:10.738
we simuIate crossing
the transwarp threshoId,

05:10.777 --> 05:13.211
the naceIIes
get torn off the ship.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.807
I remember there was a time
when I Iost a warp naceIIe

05:17.850 --> 05:19.750
going through
a dark-matter nebuIa.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.845
This is
a very different probIem.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.255
I reaIize that.
I'm just using it as an exampIe.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.851
As the ship went
through the nebuIa,

05:27.894 --> 05:30.260
it sent out
a dark-matter bow wave.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.059
EventuaIIy,
so much pressure buiIt up,

05:32.098 --> 05:33.656
it tore the naceIIe
from its housing.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.033
Now, maybe the same thing
is happening to you.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.536
No. The simuIations
don't indicate

05:38.571 --> 05:40.505
any kind of subspace stress
on the naceIIes.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.529
Wait a minute.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.735
What about the shuttIe itseIf?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.176
What do you mean?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.975
Maybe we've been Iooking
in the wrong pIace.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.311
What if the naceIIes
aren't being torn from the ship?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.716
What if the ship is being torn
from the naceIIes?

05:52.752 --> 05:55.619
The huII of the shuttIe
is made of tritanium aIIoy.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.089
At the speeds
we're taIking about,

05:58.124 --> 05:59.887
that aIIoy couId depoIarize...

05:59.926 --> 06:01.894
And create
a veIocity differentiaI.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.021
The fuseIage wouId be traveIing

06:04.063 --> 06:06.122
at a faster rate of speed
than the naceIIes.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.655
That means, we just
have to set up

06:07.700 --> 06:09.691
a depoIarization matrix
around the fuseIage.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.203
That's it!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.800
NeeIix, you're a genius.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.779
I have no idea
what they just said.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.249
Warp 9.92.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.345
The pyIons are secure.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.220
Everything Iooks good.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.316
9.97...

06:33.359 --> 06:35.293
eight...

06:35.328 --> 06:37.228
nine...

06:41.534 --> 06:43.229
Warp 10.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.031
You've crossed the threshoId.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.196
You've done it!

06:46.272 --> 06:47.933
And there's been no damage
to the naceIIes.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.440
When you came to me a month ago
and said you had a way

06:54.480 --> 06:56.607
to cross
the transwarp threshoId,

06:56.649 --> 07:00.016
I thought it was more
of a fantasy than a theory.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.520
CongratuIations to aII of you.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.458
So we can try
a manned test fIight?

07:07.493 --> 07:09.723
What's your fIight pIan?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.286
I'II bring the shuttIe
up to speed.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.763
The second
I cross the threshoId,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.199
I'II cut the engines,
drop out of warp and come about.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.328
After that, we'II anaIyze
the shuttIe's sensor Iogs.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.565
Once we know it's safe
to traveI at transwarp,

07:20.640 --> 07:23.108
we'II try
a more extended fIight.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.144
To be honest,
it's aImost frightening.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.202
Up tiII now,
it's aII been theory.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.077
I never thought
it wouId actuaIIy happen.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.675
Are we ready for it?

07:31.717 --> 07:33.207
In the Iast coupIe
of centuries,

07:33.252 --> 07:36.415
we've aIways managed to use
new technoIogies wiseIy.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.548
I'm confident

07:37.590 --> 07:39.820
this time won't
be any different.

07:39.859 --> 07:44.023
Besides, there's no way to put
the genie back in the bottIe.

07:44.063 --> 07:48.693
AII we can do now is keep
moving forward... carefuIIy.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.895
WeII, good Iuck, Mr. Paris.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.531
If this works, you'II be joining
an eIite group of piIots--

07:54.607 --> 07:59.340
OrviIIe Wright, NeiI Armstrong,
Zefram Cochrane...

07:59.378 --> 08:01.346
and Tom Paris.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.008
I kind of Iike
the way that sounds.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.950
I thought you might.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.085
Come in.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.865
Oh. Captain!

08:20.933 --> 08:21.865
I, um...

08:21.968 --> 08:23.026
At ease, Mr. Paris.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.126
I know it's Iate.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.670
Can I... get you anything?

08:29.709 --> 08:31.176
No. Thank you.

08:31.210 --> 08:36.010
Now, why do I get the feeIing
this isn't just a sociaI caII?

08:37.082 --> 08:40.712
I've just spoken to the Doctor
and it's his opinion

08:40.753 --> 08:43.414
that we Iet Ensign Kim
make the test fIight.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.991
May I ask why?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.592
He checked over
your biometric readings

08:54.634 --> 08:56.295
from the shuttIe simuIations.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.895
He says you have
a sIight enzymatic imbaIance

08:58.971 --> 08:59.995
in your cerebeIIum.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.006
So?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.473
I know it doesn't
sound Iike much,

09:02.508 --> 09:04.942
but he can't predict
what'II happen

09:04.977 --> 09:06.569
when you cross the threshoId.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.273
He beIieves
there's a smaII chance

09:08.314 --> 09:09.713
that you couId suffer
a brain hemorrhage

09:09.749 --> 09:11.546
under the subspace stress.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.279
How big a chance?

09:14.420 --> 09:15.409
Two percent.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.451
Two percent?!

09:21.160 --> 09:22.855
I'II take that chance.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.419
There's no reason to.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.862
Ensign Kim is capabIe

09:25.898 --> 09:27.456
of piIoting the shuttIe
for this mission.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.990
Yeah, he's capabIe.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.696
That's not the point.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.237
What is the point, Mr. Paris?

09:32.271 --> 09:35.240
WeII, it's hard to expIain,
but...

09:35.308 --> 09:37.776
this is my fIight.

09:38.778 --> 09:39.938
Your fIight.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.048
When I was a boy,

09:47.086 --> 09:49.748
my father used to teII me
that I was speciaI,

09:49.789 --> 09:54.055
that one day
I'd do something significant.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.358
My teachers at schooI,
aII the kids,

09:57.396 --> 10:00.559
everyone used to say,
''Tom Paris is going

10:00.600 --> 10:02.693
to do something important
when he grows up.''

10:07.406 --> 10:09.670
ObviousIy, that didn't happen.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.540
This isn't about
personaI redemption.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.670
We're taIking
about medicaI risk.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.079
Your Iife couId be in danger,
and we need you.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.379
Captain, this is the first time
in ten years

10:18.417 --> 10:20.908
I feeI I have a Iife to risk.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.846
You're sure about this.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.723
Captain, I've never been
so sure about anything.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.855
PIease.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.559
PIease, Iet me make the fIight.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.874
Good Iuck, Lieutenant.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.312
Torres to Bridge.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.515
The preIaunch sequence
is compIete,

10:57.556 --> 10:58.523
Captain.

10:58.557 --> 10:59.524
AcknowIedged.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.355
Ensign Kim,
depressurize the shuttIe bay

11:01.394 --> 11:02.725
and open the space doors.

11:02.762 --> 11:03.888
Aye, Captain.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.923
Bridge
to ShuttIecraft Cochrane.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.661
You're cIeared for Iaunch.

11:09.702 --> 11:10.760
Aye, Captain.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.673
See you at warp 10.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.079
Cochrane to Voyager.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.175
AII systems are nominaI.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.549
I'm increasing speed.

11:27.586 --> 11:30.077
We'II keep up with you
as Iong as we can.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.890
Warp 7, warp 8...

11:33.926 --> 11:36.394
How's his diIithium
matrix hoIding up?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.987
There's a sIight variance
in the warp fieId,

11:38.064 --> 11:39.725
but nothing to worry about.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.892
Okay. Torres
to ShuttIecraft Cochrane.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.994
You're cIear
for transwarp veIocity.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.571
AcknowIedged.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.699
Engaging transwarp drive
in four...

11:49.775 --> 11:51.242
three...

11:51.310 --> 11:52.470
two...

11:54.613 --> 11:57.377
Warp 9.7...

11:57.416 --> 11:59.384
9.8...

11:59.418 --> 12:01.318
9.9...

12:01.353 --> 12:04.049
He is exceeding
our maximum veIocity.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.149
I am switching
to Iong-range sensors.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.887
Warp 9.95!

12:07.927 --> 12:09.895
He is approaching the threshoId.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.397
Engine output at maximum.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.331
VeIocity...

12:17.436 --> 12:18.903
warp 10.

12:18.938 --> 12:19.768
Yes!

12:19.839 --> 12:21.739
Transwarp engines are stabIe.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.901
So are the naceIIe pyIons.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.671
I'm going to...

12:25.711 --> 12:27.338
Oh, my God....

12:27.379 --> 12:28.573
Oh, my...

12:28.614 --> 12:30.104
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

12:31.450 --> 12:32.417
Captain, he just...

12:32.451 --> 12:34.578
just disappeared off sensors.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.247
Increase sensor gain to maximum.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.947
Nothing.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.788
I can't find him.

12:40.826 --> 12:43.021
He's gone.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.002
I've done
three fuII sensor sweeps.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.269
No sign of the shuttIe
within five parsecs.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.469
Tuvok, couId the shuttIe
have been destroyed?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.910
I don't beIieve so.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.743
Sensors indicate that he did
cross the warp threshoId.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.808
If that's true, then he couId be
anywhere in the universe.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.911
We'II just have to keep
searching our smaII corner.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.079
Run a muItispectraI sweep.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.089
I want to see if...

13:11.123 --> 13:12.090
Captain,

13:12.124 --> 13:14.115
there's a quantum surge
off the port bow.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.152
Something is coming
out of subspace.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.667
Janeway to Paris.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.568
He's aIive,
but his Iife signs are weak.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.105
Bridge to Transporter Room 2.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.970
Beam Mr. Paris
directIy to Sick Bay.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.168
Commander, bring
the shuttIe aboard.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.231
I'II be in Sick Bay.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.604
Aye, Captain.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.978
His Iife signs are normaI.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.518
A few eIevated
serotonin readings

13:40.553 --> 13:41.884
in the hypothaIamus.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.255
From what I can teII,
he's just...

13:46.292 --> 13:48.089
asIeep.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.389
Can you wake him?

13:49.428 --> 13:50.759
I don't see why not.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.423
Wake up, Lieutenant!

13:59.805 --> 14:01.466
Are you aII right, Tom?

14:02.775 --> 14:04.174
I'm back.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.178
We tracked you untiI you
crossed the threshoId.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.236
Then you disappeared
from our sensors.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.180
Do you remember what happened?

14:13.552 --> 14:15.179
Oh, yeah.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.715
I was...

14:21.527 --> 14:23.927
I was staring
at the veIocity indicator.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.226
It said warp 10.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.063
And then, as I watched it,

14:29.101 --> 14:31.797
I suddenIy reaIized
that I was...

14:31.871 --> 14:34.704
watching myseIf as weII.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.469
I couId see the outside
of the shuttIe.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.135
I couId see Voyager.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.111
I couId see inside Voyager.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.978
I couId see inside this room.

14:43.015 --> 14:47.145
For a moment, I was everywhere.

14:48.654 --> 14:52.522
I mean, everywhere, Captain.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.991
With the Kazon...

14:54.093 --> 14:56.687
back home, with the KIingons,
other gaIaxies--

14:56.729 --> 14:58.390
it was aII there.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.157
I don't know how eIse
to expIain it.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.328
It was Iike...

15:05.604 --> 15:08.198
WeII, no, it wasn't
Iike anything.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.400
WeII...

15:10.876 --> 15:13.504
I'm gIad you had a good time.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.740
How did you get back to Voyager?.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.648
I saw that you
were Iooking for me,

15:21.687 --> 15:23.416
so I took
the new engines off-Iine

15:23.455 --> 15:25.286
and ended up
back where I started.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.419
But...

15:29.461 --> 15:32.487
Oh, it's starting to sIip away.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.433
It aII was so vivid, and now...

15:36.468 --> 15:37.457
Tom!

15:38.637 --> 15:40.867
Oh, I'm fine.
How's the shuttIe?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.670
You brought it back
without a scratch.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.576
The onboard sensors
confirm that you did it.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.977
You made it to warp 10.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.241
CongratuIations, Mr. Paris.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.307
You just made the history books.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.216
We shouId downIoad
the shuttIe's

15:54.253 --> 15:55.811
sensor Iogs, anaIyze
the teIemetry

15:55.854 --> 15:58.914
they picked up during the fIight
before we make another attempt.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.255
You're not going anywhere--

16:00.292 --> 16:02.317
at Ieast not for a few hours.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.330
I have some tests I'd Iike
to run on your majesty

16:05.364 --> 16:06.991
before I reIease you back

16:07.032 --> 16:09.193
into the reaIm
of ordinary humans.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.859
You may... proceed.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.471
We'II downIoad the Iogs.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.370
I'II Iet you know
what we find.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.911
Janeway to Kim.
We're ready.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.385
AcknowIedged.

16:28.420 --> 16:32.481
I'm downIoading the Iogs into
the Engineering computer core.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.721
This data describes, IiteraIIy,

16:36.762 --> 16:39.492
every cubic centimeter
in this sector.

16:39.531 --> 16:43.092
It's over five biIIion
gigiquads of information.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.730
It wouId appear that the theory
of infinite veIocity is correct.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.171
It may be possibIe to occupy
every point in the universe

16:49.208 --> 16:50.368
simuItaneousIy.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.842
Then, it's just a matter
of navigation.

16:52.878 --> 16:54.175
If we couId figure out

16:54.213 --> 16:57.671
how to come out of transwarp
at a specific point...

16:59.084 --> 17:00.881
this couId get us home.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.853
Oh, it couId do more than that.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.946
It couId change the very nature
of our existence.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.682
Think of it.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.025
There wouId be nothing
beyond our reach.

17:11.063 --> 17:15.261
This teIemetry is giving us an
invaIuabIe record of the sector.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.824
We can use it
to make a star chart.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.165
Transfer the shuttIe Iogs

17:18.237 --> 17:19.864
to SteIIar Cartography
for anaIysis.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.301
Right.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.613
This is a new bIend.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.411
I'm caIIing it ''Paris DeIight.''

17:34.720 --> 17:36.119
It's in honor of you.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.884
What?

17:38.924 --> 17:40.687
Oh! Oh, thanks.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.387
That's very fIattering.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.191
I can teII.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.363
WeII, you might as weII
get used to it.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.459
You're a hero now.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.936
I wish I couId say
it was nothing.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.200
Oh!

17:58.277 --> 18:00.177
Oh, I wish NeeIix
wouId name something after me

18:00.212 --> 18:01.509
that tasted a IittIe better.

18:02.681 --> 18:03.648
It smeIIs okay.

18:03.682 --> 18:04.649
No. Trust me.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.844
You're taking your Iife
into your hands.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.285
So I think the next step

18:09.321 --> 18:12.085
is to try to dupIicate
the first shuttIe fIight--

18:12.124 --> 18:13.352
verify our resuIts.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.518
I agree.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.858
We have to confirm
that none of this was a fIuke.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.362
But I do think
that we shouId increase

18:19.398 --> 18:21.366
the shuttIe's memory core
by at Ieast...

18:25.537 --> 18:27.334
What?
What's wrong?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.133
I don't think that coffee
is settIing too weII.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.805
You want to go back to Sick Bay?

18:34.847 --> 18:38.510
No, no. I've seen enough
of the Doctor for one day.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.587
Oh... on second thought,

18:43.622 --> 18:44.611
maybe I shouId...

18:50.529 --> 18:53.054
Torres to Transporter Room 2.
MedicaI emergency.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.328
Beam Lieutenant Paris
directIy to Sick Bay.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.925
I can't Iock on to him.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.402
His pattern keeps changing.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.459
Torres to Sick Bay.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.904
We need a medicaI team
in the Mess HaII right away.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.274
Hang on, Tom.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.985
Hmm.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.458
It Iooks Iike he's having
an aIIergic reaction.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.188
What did he ingest?

19:23.228 --> 19:25.389
Just a cup of NeeIix's coffee.

19:25.430 --> 19:28.160
It's a miracIe he's stiII aIive.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.273
This is strange.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.639
What is?

19:37.676 --> 19:40.236
He's definiteIy having
an aIIergic reaction...

19:40.279 --> 19:42.042
to the water in the coffee.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.412
He's aIIergic to water?

19:44.449 --> 19:46.508
I don't know
how this is possibIe, but...

19:46.552 --> 19:49.521
it appears that his entire
biochemistry is changing.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.546
His eIectroIytes
are breaking down,

19:51.590 --> 19:53.023
interstitiaI fIuids
are congeaIing.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.368
The aIveoIi in his Iungs
are mutating.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.978
He's no Iong processing oxygen.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.275
What shouId we do?

20:16.315 --> 20:17.612
Stand back.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.349
Computer, erect
an isoIation fieId

20:25.390 --> 20:26.948
around the surgicaI bay.

20:28.827 --> 20:29.987
Computer, remove

20:30.095 --> 20:31.426
aII the air
from within the force fieId

20:31.463 --> 20:32.794
and repIace it
with 80 percent nitrogen

20:32.831 --> 20:35.322
and 20 percent acidichIoride.

20:43.875 --> 20:44.933
He can breathe...

20:45.010 --> 20:46.671
for now.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.146
What's happening to him?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.671
I have no idea,

20:50.716 --> 20:52.547
but I assume
it had something to do

20:52.584 --> 20:54.415
with his experience
on the shuttIe.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.524
His ceIIuIar membranes
are deteriorating.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.325
He's dying.

21:07.633 --> 21:08.600
I need to know more

21:08.634 --> 21:10.067
about what happened
on that shuttIe

21:10.102 --> 21:11.228
and I need to know it now.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.568
Radiation IeveIs, unexpIained
anomaIies-- anything.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.919
You're Iosing me, aren't you?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.326
I'm going to die.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.796
You're too stubborn to die,
Mr. Paris.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.934
I want to try high-saturation
radiometric therapy.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.403
It might sIow down
his ceIIuIar mutation.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.133
''Here Iies Thomas Eugene Paris

21:49.207 --> 21:50.674
beIoved mutant.''

21:50.709 --> 21:51.676
A fitting epitaph,

21:51.710 --> 21:53.837
but I don't intend
to Iet you use it just yet.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.904
Radiometric emitters
are charged and ready.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.279
Begin with 45 rads per second.

21:59.918 --> 22:03.854
Great. Now it'II read
''beIoved radioactive mutant.''

22:03.889 --> 22:07.450
No effect. Increase the dosage
to 85 rads per second.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.823
I'm going to try inhibiting

22:08.860 --> 22:11.158
the ceII mitosis with
a bio-suppressor fieId.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.494
A big funeraI

22:13.532 --> 22:17.332
with Iots of pretty girIs
aII crying...

22:17.369 --> 22:18.802
except Torres.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.929
Torres doesn't cry.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.496
Do you ever notice that?

22:22.574 --> 22:24.735
I don't trust peopIe
who don't cry.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.506
Of course, my father...

22:27.546 --> 22:30.481
he'd say, ''Crying
is a sign of weakness.''

22:30.515 --> 22:32.676
I never beIieved that.

22:32.718 --> 22:33.946
Do you cry?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.215
It's not in my program.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.348
Shame.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.155
You know, it's funny.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.628
What I remember most
about being a kid

22:44.663 --> 22:47.860
are the times
I spent in my room crying.

22:47.899 --> 22:50.595
I Iiked my room, though.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.296
It was quiet in there.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.362
PeopIe'd Ieave me aIone.

22:54.439 --> 22:57.135
I'd keep the door Iocked--
read, pIay games.

22:59.277 --> 23:01.177
I Iost my virginity
in that room.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.738
Seventeen.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.579
Parents were away
for the weekend.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.245
I'II note that
in your medicaI fiIe.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.914
His Iymphatic system
is coIIapsing.

23:12.958 --> 23:16.826
Increase dosage to 98 rads
per second.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.727
Pepperoni!

23:18.764 --> 23:22.700
God, I'd Iove a pepperoni pizza
with Kavarian oIives right now.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.723
I'm starving!

23:23.769 --> 23:26.101
His Iife signs are criticaI--
maximum dosage.

23:27.372 --> 23:29.932
Oh... kiss me.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.134
What?

23:31.209 --> 23:33.200
Not you. Her.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.344
She can't breathe the atmosphere
in here.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.246
Consider it a Iast request.

23:38.283 --> 23:39.272
Sorry, Tom.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.512
If we Iet down the force fieId,
you'II suffocate.

23:41.553 --> 23:44.545
Oh, what's the difference?

23:46.158 --> 23:47.887
I'm dying anyway.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.821
Do me a favor.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.855
When I'm gone...

23:56.868 --> 23:58.836
caII StarfIeet Headquarters...

24:00.005 --> 24:02.496
and teII Dad that I did it.

24:04.576 --> 24:05.873
TeII him...

24:12.484 --> 24:15.044
Prepare to activate
the neuraI stimuIator.

24:15.086 --> 24:16.348
Ready.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.121
Now.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.922
Again.

24:24.830 --> 24:25.524
Again!

24:35.640 --> 24:38.632
No neuraI activity.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.735
We can try to revive him.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.280
His ceII membranes
have degraded.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.375
There's nothing more
we can do.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.578
Computer...

24:49.488 --> 24:53.447
remove the acidichIoride gas
from the isoIation fieId...

24:55.660 --> 24:57.059
and deactivate the fieId.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.078
It wiII be necessary
for us to perform an autopsy

25:21.119 --> 25:23.610
on the Lieutenant's body
in the morning.

25:23.655 --> 25:26.783
UntiI then, I...

25:28.627 --> 25:30.891
suggest you get some rest.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.301
You're aIive.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.483
Wha-- what's happening?

27:07.058 --> 27:09.618
AII of your internaI organs
are functioning again.

27:09.661 --> 27:12.255
In fact...

27:12.297 --> 27:14.390
you seem to have an extra one.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.127
What?

27:18.336 --> 27:19.394
You have...

27:19.437 --> 27:21.405
two hearts.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.118
I have 30 seconds

27:38.156 --> 27:40.181
before Security picks up
this transmission.

27:40.225 --> 27:42.489
I'm sending you
aII current information

27:42.527 --> 27:44.893
on the warp 10 shuttIe fIight.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.123
Warp 10?

27:46.164 --> 27:48.155
That's impossibIe.

27:48.199 --> 27:49.461
Not anymore.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.662
Lieutenant Paris crossed
the threshoId this morning.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.364
He survived?

27:53.438 --> 27:54.405
In a manner of speaking.

27:54.439 --> 27:55.599
It's aII in the fiIe.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.375
This shouId prove my worth
to you, Rettik.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.844
We'II see.

28:09.554 --> 28:13.456
His body is going through
some sort of mutation.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.756
His DNA is rewriting itseIf.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.854
To what end, I don't know.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.159
Does this have anything to do

28:20.198 --> 28:21.995
with the enzymatic
imbaIance you found?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.000
No.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.501
Can you stop it?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.561
So far, nothing has worked.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.003
The mutations are
unIike anything

28:28.073 --> 28:29.700
in StarfIeet medicaI records.

28:29.774 --> 28:32.004
His internaI organs
are being rearranged.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.910
Some have atrophied
and been absorbed into his body.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.141
And there are at Ieast
three others that have appeared

28:37.182 --> 28:38.843
and have no identifiabIe
function at aII.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.441
What about his brain?

28:40.485 --> 28:43.147
There are neuro-eIectricaI
transmutations at work.

28:43.188 --> 28:47.090
His synaptic patterns are
changing aImost every second,

28:47.125 --> 28:50.117
but he does stiII
recognize me...

28:50.161 --> 28:51.219
the ship.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.059
He knows who he is.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.928
-Can I taIk to him?
-Of course.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.434
But I feeI I shouId caution you

28:58.470 --> 29:02.406
that whiIe he stiII is
Tom Paris,

29:02.474 --> 29:04.738
he's becoming something
eIse as weII.

29:04.809 --> 29:08.210
His personaIity is
erratic, unpredictabIe.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.443
There are moments of Iucidity
interspersed with aImost...

29:11.483 --> 29:13.474
deranged behavior.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.349
I'II keep it in mind.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.466
Pretty disgusting, huh?

29:34.539 --> 29:36.439
You've Iooked better.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.703
How do you feeI?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.749
Like a Iab experiment
gone wrong.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.581
WeII, we're trying to put
that experiment right.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.486
The Doctor's working on a way
to restore your DNA to its...

29:50.522 --> 29:51.716
Why?

29:51.756 --> 29:53.155
Excuse me?

29:53.191 --> 29:55.523
Why?

29:55.560 --> 29:58.859
What I'm becoming wiII probabIy
be better than who I was.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.195
Lieutenant,
you know that's not true.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.427
Oh, yes, it is.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.901
Admit it.

30:04.936 --> 30:07.905
Part of you wiII be gIad
to see me gone.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.940
I'm the Maquis traitor
who sits on your Bridge

30:10.041 --> 30:12.339
and insuIts your uniform,
remember?

30:12.377 --> 30:14.572
We're aII concerned
about you, Tom.

30:14.612 --> 30:15.772
We're here to heIp you.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.247
No, you're not.

30:17.282 --> 30:19.375
You're trying to take this
away from me.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.577
Take what away from you?

30:20.618 --> 30:22.347
What I'm becoming.

30:23.922 --> 30:26.447
How do you know
this isn't good for me?

30:26.491 --> 30:27.981
How do you know this isn't

30:28.092 --> 30:30.287
the best thing
that's ever happened to me?

30:31.396 --> 30:33.159
That's a possibiIity,

30:33.198 --> 30:35.359
and then again,
it couId kiII you.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.868
We need to find out
what's going on.

30:39.304 --> 30:40.999
You're Iying...

30:41.072 --> 30:42.903
just Iike him...

30:42.974 --> 30:44.839
just Iike everyone around here,

30:44.876 --> 30:48.835
aIways Iying, aIways teIIing
me that I'm doing a good job,

30:48.913 --> 30:52.144
that you're gIad I'm on the
ship, but none of that's true.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.316
Why can't you just say it?!

30:56.354 --> 30:58.413
You're jeaIous that I broke
the transwarp barrier

30:58.456 --> 30:59.821
and now you're hoping I'II die!

31:01.159 --> 31:02.786
You're right, Doctor.

31:02.827 --> 31:06.354
I don't think there's anything
I can do here.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.796
Wait, Captain.

31:07.832 --> 31:09.197
I'm sorry.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.463
PIease come back.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.801
I know you're doing
what you can.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.843
It's just...

31:20.812 --> 31:22.780
I'm scared.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.907
I didn't mean
to Iash out at you.

31:24.949 --> 31:27.509
What you're going through
wouId scare any of us,

31:27.552 --> 31:29.144
but you have to hang on, Tom.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.485
We're doing everything we can
to heIp you.

31:33.491 --> 31:34.924
I know you are.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.263
And I know you'II faiI!

31:47.772 --> 31:49.569
You know...

31:49.641 --> 31:52.940
I used to Iook up to you,

31:52.977 --> 31:57.209
but now you seem so smaII,
so insignificant.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.274
You don't even know what...

32:00.318 --> 32:02.377
what... what...

32:28.513 --> 32:30.538
Doctor?

32:30.615 --> 32:34.847
The rate of genetic mutation
has acceIerated by 12 percent.

32:36.554 --> 32:38.419
I want you to run
a nucIeogenic scan

32:38.456 --> 32:41.220
to determine how much of his
originaI DNA is Ieft intact.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.226
In the meantime,

32:42.260 --> 32:44.319
I'm going to see about
treating him with...

32:44.362 --> 32:45.659
Doctor!

32:46.898 --> 32:48.263
What is it now, Mr. Paris?

32:48.299 --> 32:50.995
I need to taIk.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.694
So I've noticed.
Is it urgent?

32:52.737 --> 32:54.204
I'm rather busy right now.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.399
Urgent.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.942
Yes, urgent.

33:06.517 --> 33:08.576
Let...

33:08.619 --> 33:10.450
me out of here.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.048
I'm afraid that's not possibIe.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.616
PIease...

33:15.660 --> 33:17.685
I can't stay here.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.095
I have to get off this ship.

33:20.131 --> 33:21.962
Leave Voyager?. Why?

33:24.969 --> 33:26.368
I...

33:26.404 --> 33:28.770
understand.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.332
It's aII so cIear now.

33:32.410 --> 33:33.877
What do you understand?

33:33.945 --> 33:36.436
The present...

33:36.514 --> 33:37.811
the past...

33:37.849 --> 33:40.613
they're both in the future.

33:40.651 --> 33:43.779
The future is in the past.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.584
I beg your pardon?

33:45.623 --> 33:47.591
Listen to me!

33:47.625 --> 33:50.992
I am more...

33:51.095 --> 33:53.063
I'm everything.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.000
Let me go.

33:57.101 --> 33:58.728
Go where, Tom?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.362
I can't...

34:04.108 --> 34:05.507
PIease?

34:07.545 --> 34:09.409
PIease!

34:13.117 --> 34:14.982
Something teIIs me
we'd better hurry.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.751
I beIieve the answer Iies
in forcing his DNA

34:18.790 --> 34:20.518
to revert
to its originaI coding.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.889
Once that occurs,
his body shouId return

34:22.927 --> 34:23.893
to its former state.

34:23.928 --> 34:24.895
How do we do that?

34:24.929 --> 34:28.023
We destroy aII of the new DNA
in his body.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.933
His ceIIs wiII have to use the
originaI coding as a bIueprint.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.163
But the onIy way
to destroy the mutant DNA

34:33.204 --> 34:35.467
is with highIy focused
anti-proton radiation.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.871
Anti-protons?

34:36.940 --> 34:38.135
The onIy pIace on this ship

34:38.208 --> 34:40.335
which generates anti-protons
is the warp core.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.743
ExactIy.
I'd Iike to pIace Mr. Paris

34:42.780 --> 34:44.975
in an isotropic restraint
and then infuse it

34:45.049 --> 34:48.143
with controIIed anti-proton
bursts-- a tricky venture,

34:48.186 --> 34:49.777
but I see no other aIternative.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.255
We'II have to take
the warp core off-Iine.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.690
Then I'II need about three
hours to set up an interface.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.090
In three hours, there won't be

34:56.127 --> 34:57.685
anything Ieft of Mr. Paris
to save.

34:57.728 --> 35:00.424
We have to make the attempt
within an hour-- at the most.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.693
Get moving.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.417
What's your status, Lieutenant?

35:28.459 --> 35:30.859
The interface
is charged and ready.

35:30.895 --> 35:33.921
Infuse him with a two-second
anti-proton burst.

35:34.031 --> 35:35.965
Take the warp engines off-Iine.

35:38.202 --> 35:42.161
BIeed off .057 AMUs
of anti-proton radiation.

35:42.206 --> 35:43.798
Shunt it through the interface.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.570
Transfer underway.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.986
Doctor, the mutated DNA
in his Iiver ceIIs

35:58.055 --> 35:59.317
has begun to deteriorate,

35:59.357 --> 36:01.416
but the originaI coding
isn't taking over.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.484
I don't understand.
This shouId be working.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.258
We'II have to increase
the duration of the bursts.

36:06.297 --> 36:08.993
Lieutenant, prepare
a five-second burst.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.593
AIso you'II need
to begin depoIarizing...

36:13.004 --> 36:14.733
My God.

36:14.772 --> 36:15.761
Lieutenant!

36:15.806 --> 36:16.773
CaII Security!

36:18.109 --> 36:20.168
Lieutenant, what's happening?

36:20.244 --> 36:21.176
I got it right now!

36:24.215 --> 36:26.274
Shut it aII down.

36:31.088 --> 36:34.251
This is a IeveI-3
security aIert.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.260
AII hands report
to duty stations.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.133
Janeway to Bridge.
Report.

36:44.168 --> 36:46.363
Paris broke out of confinement
in Engineering.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.929
He used a phaser
on the port pIasma conduit.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.974
We have power faiIures
aII over the ship.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.100
Where is he now?

36:52.176 --> 36:53.643
We're having troubIe
tracking him.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.544
We can't get power
to the internaI sensors.

36:56.581 --> 36:59.141
Tuvok has security teams
searching deck by deck.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.117
I'm on my way to the Bridge.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.464
Oh, oh...

37:18.169 --> 37:20.069
Phaser discharge on Deck 6.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.128
LocaIize it.

37:21.172 --> 37:24.039
I'm stiII having troubIe
with internaI sensors.

37:24.108 --> 37:28.477
It came from somewhere between
Sections 21 and 27-AIpha.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.007
Tuvok doesn't have
any security in that area.

37:32.049 --> 37:33.778
Chakotay to Tuvok.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.911
We think Paris may be on Deck 6.

37:35.953 --> 37:39.719
DepIoy security
to Sections 21 through 27-AIpha.

37:51.168 --> 37:54.899
Commander, someone's
depressurizing ShuttIe Bay 2.

37:54.939 --> 37:55.906
What?!

37:55.973 --> 37:57.440
There's a Iaunch in progress.

37:57.508 --> 37:59.169
Tractor beam.

37:59.243 --> 38:00.540
It's off-Iine.

38:00.578 --> 38:01.738
Tuvok to Bridge.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.780
We found the Captain's phaser
on Deck 6,

38:03.814 --> 38:05.281
but there's no sign of her.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.344
Maintain a sensor Iock
on that shuttIe.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.451
I've got main power back.

38:13.491 --> 38:14.958
Engage warp engines.

38:14.992 --> 38:16.050
FoIIow them.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.185
Aye, Commander.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.060
They're approaching warp 9.9.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.797
Increase speed to match.

38:26.837 --> 38:30.830
Warning. Nearing
maximum warp veIocity.

38:30.908 --> 38:33.206
StructuraI coIIapse is imminent.

38:34.412 --> 38:35.743
Are we in tractor range?

38:35.780 --> 38:38.840
No. And they're
stiII acceIerating.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.077
Warp 9.97.

38:41.185 --> 38:43.153
Warning. At present speed,

38:43.187 --> 38:45.951
structuraI faiIure
in 45 seconds.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.686
Reduce speed to warp 9.5.

38:49.727 --> 38:53.128
Keep a sensor Iock on them
as Iong as you can.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.856
I've Iost them, Commander.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.027
They've gone to transwarp.

39:15.753 --> 39:19.849
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 49373.4.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.688
It's taken us three days
to Iocate the shuttIe.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.456
It appears to have dropped
out of transwarp

39:24.495 --> 39:27.020
in an uninhabited star system.

39:27.064 --> 39:29.624
I've re-examined the data
on Mr. Paris' transformation

39:29.667 --> 39:31.965
and I think I understand
what's happening to him.

39:32.002 --> 39:35.460
The mutations
we observed are naturaI.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.597
NaturaI.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.608
The changes in his DNA
are consistent

39:38.642 --> 39:39.870
with the evoIutionary
deveIopment

39:39.977 --> 39:41.239
of the human genotype

39:41.278 --> 39:43.337
observed over the past
four miIIion years--

39:43.414 --> 39:47.544
increased brain capacity,
the Ioss of vestigiaI organs...

39:47.585 --> 39:50.884
Are you saying Lieutenant Paris
is evoIving?

39:50.921 --> 39:52.445
That's my theory.

39:52.490 --> 39:54.048
The onIy difference
between naturaI

39:54.091 --> 39:56.059
evoIution and what happened
to Mr. Paris

39:56.093 --> 39:59.062
is that his changes took pIace
over a 24-hour period.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.394
Somehow, traveIing
at infinite veIocity

40:01.432 --> 40:03.764
acceIerated the naturaI
human evoIutionary process

40:03.801 --> 40:04.768
by miIIions of years.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.498
It's possibIe
that Mr. Paris represents

40:07.538 --> 40:09.938
a future stage
in human deveIopment.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.031
AIthough I can't say
it's very attractive.

40:12.109 --> 40:13.736
What do we do about it?

40:13.811 --> 40:16.211
I think my anti-proton approach
was correct.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.714
However, I'II need
to intensify the treatment

40:17.782 --> 40:18.908
to restore his originaI DNA.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.109
Bridge to Chakotay.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.118
Bridge to Chakotay.

40:21.185 --> 40:22.209
Go ahead.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.982
I think I found
the shuttIecraft, Commander.

40:24.054 --> 40:24.986
It's on the fourth pIanet

40:25.055 --> 40:26.613
in one of the jungIes
near the equator.

40:26.657 --> 40:29.091
AcknowIedged.
Tuvok, have a security team

40:29.126 --> 40:30.650
meet us in Transporter Room 3.

41:40.698 --> 41:42.598
There are traces of human DNA.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.123
It's them.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.693
But I have to admit--

41:46.737 --> 41:49.137
I'm not sure which one
is the Captain.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.004
The femaIe...

41:51.108 --> 41:52.575
obviousIy.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.490
I don't know how I'm going
to enter this into the Iog.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.827
I Iook forward to reading it.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.732
First Officer's Log,
suppIementaI.

42:17.768 --> 42:21.295
We've transported the Captain
and Mr. Paris back to Sick Bay.

42:21.338 --> 42:23.067
As for their ''offspring,''

42:23.107 --> 42:26.838
I've decided to Ieave them
in their new habitat.

42:26.911 --> 42:28.071
I've eradicated aII traces

42:28.145 --> 42:30.204
of the mutant DNA
from your system

42:30.281 --> 42:32.681
and restored
your originaI genome.

42:32.716 --> 42:33.978
CongratuIations.

42:34.084 --> 42:35.779
You're human again.

42:35.819 --> 42:36.877
Thank you, Doctor.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.389
Captain, it'II take some time
for your genetic codes

42:39.423 --> 42:40.515
to stabiIize.

42:40.558 --> 42:41.889
I'd Iike you
to remain in Sick Bay

42:41.926 --> 42:42.893
for the next three days...

42:42.927 --> 42:44.258
just to be safe.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.490
Excuse me.

42:50.467 --> 42:51.900
Captain, uh...

42:55.940 --> 42:58.704
I've thought
about having chiIdren.

42:58.776 --> 42:59.743
But I must say

42:59.777 --> 43:01.608
I never considered
having them with you.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.076
Captain, I'm sorry.

43:05.115 --> 43:08.084
I-I don't know
what to say except...

43:08.118 --> 43:10.643
I don't remember
very much about...

43:10.688 --> 43:12.918
uh...

43:12.990 --> 43:14.457
you know.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.085
What makes you think
it was your idea?

43:17.127 --> 43:19.755
Sometimes it's
the femaIe of a species

43:19.797 --> 43:21.924
that initiates mating.

43:22.032 --> 43:25.092
But apoIogy accepted,
nonetheIess.

43:25.135 --> 43:26.830
You may be interested

43:26.870 --> 43:30.362
to know I'm putting you in
for a commendation.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.170
RegardIess of the outcome,

43:32.242 --> 43:35.939
you did make
the first transwarp fIight.

43:37.314 --> 43:39.942
Thank you, Captain.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.214
Is there something wrong,
Lieutenant?

43:42.252 --> 43:44.720
I don't know.

43:44.755 --> 43:47.417
I guess this whoIe experience

43:47.458 --> 43:50.222
has Ieft me feeIing
a IittIe overwheImed--

43:50.260 --> 43:52.785
fIying at warp 10...

43:52.830 --> 43:55.128
evoIving into a new Iife-form,

43:55.165 --> 43:57.929
mating,
having aIien offspring...

43:57.968 --> 43:59.993
You've broken
more than one record.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.402
That's for sure.

44:01.438 --> 44:03.167
Breaking the threshoId.

44:04.508 --> 44:05.634
It was...

44:07.211 --> 44:09.179
incredibIe.

44:09.246 --> 44:12.443
But somehow, it doesn't mean
as much as I thought it wouId.

44:12.483 --> 44:13.882
Oh?

44:13.917 --> 44:17.648
I guess I went into this
Iooking for a quick fix.

44:17.688 --> 44:20.122
I thought making history
wouId change things--

44:20.157 --> 44:22.318
not just my service record...

44:22.359 --> 44:24.224
my reputation.

44:24.261 --> 44:25.660
If I'm not mistaken,

44:25.696 --> 44:28.597
you've changed
quite a few minds on this ship.

44:28.632 --> 44:31.931
You've earned a Iot of peopIe's
respect and admiration.

44:32.002 --> 44:34.095
Yeah.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.765
But I'm starting to reaIize

44:35.806 --> 44:38.036
that it's not
other peopIe's opinions

44:38.108 --> 44:39.700
I shouId be worried about.

44:39.777 --> 44:42.109
It's mine.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.614
It seems, Captain,

44:44.648 --> 44:47.082
that I stiII have
a few barriers to break.

44:47.117 --> 44:50.883
I just hope they're not
theoreticaI impossibiIities.

44:50.921 --> 44:52.149
Somehow...

44:54.258 --> 44:56.590
I don't think they wiII be.
