01:13.766 --> 01:16.686
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

01:16.766 --> 01:18.966
saw deeply into life.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.966
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

01:23.806 --> 01:27.046
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

01:27.886 --> 01:31.846
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

01:32.126 --> 01:36.687
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

01:37.646 --> 01:41.606
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

01:41.646 --> 01:45.086
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

01:49.366 --> 01:50.966
Sorry.

01:56.046 --> 01:57.966
Mr. Townsend.

02:03.126 --> 02:05.086
Just this way.

02:05.846 --> 02:08.326
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

02:08.406 --> 02:11.926
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.966
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.566
Yeah, so I see.

02:15.646 --> 02:18.726
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.526
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

02:20.606 --> 02:23.926
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

02:24.006 --> 02:28.326
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

02:28.406 --> 02:30.206
You have to really want it.

02:30.286 --> 02:32.166
Not that I have their talent.

02:32.646 --> 02:35.326
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.246
And you want to live in London?

02:37.326 --> 02:40.366
Very much. Very much.

02:40.446 --> 02:43.686
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

02:43.766 --> 02:45.606
You can begin this weekend?

02:46.486 --> 02:49.086
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:50.326 --> 02:53.206
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

02:53.286 --> 02:56.086
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

02:56.166 --> 02:58.206
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

02:58.286 --> 03:00.646
You can just open it up, get your kip.

03:00.726 --> 03:02.886
Kitchen just through there.

03:02.966 --> 03:06.366
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

03:06.446 --> 03:07.686
All that stuff.

03:07.766 --> 03:10.246
Lovely view, not overlooked.

03:10.326 --> 03:12.246
So it's all good.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.846
This is 225 a week?

03:14.926 --> 03:18.606
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

03:18.686 --> 03:20.486
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

03:20.566 --> 03:23.366
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

03:23.406 --> 03:25.566
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

03:25.646 --> 03:28.646
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

03:28.726 --> 03:31.486
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.046
Very good.

04:00.726 --> 04:02.206
Chris Wilton.

04:02.246 --> 04:04.046
This is Tom Hewett.

04:04.126 --> 04:06.046
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

04:06.126 --> 04:07.846
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

04:07.926 --> 04:10.646
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

04:10.686 --> 04:13.886
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

04:13.966 --> 04:17.245
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

04:17.326 --> 04:18.846
Don't worry, it comes back.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.526
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

04:21.606 --> 04:22.926
OK.

04:22.966 --> 04:25.046
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

04:25.126 --> 04:27.206
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

04:39.046 --> 04:43.006
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

04:43.086 --> 04:45.366
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

04:45.446 --> 04:47.286
you held your own more than admirably.

04:47.366 --> 04:48.766
For a while.

04:48.846 --> 04:51.366
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

04:51.446 --> 04:53.206
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.766
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:55.846 --> 04:57.726
Get your dirty great forehand off.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.126
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

05:02.046 --> 05:04.006
So, do you need a lift after this?

05:04.046 --> 05:07.646
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

05:07.726 --> 05:11.406
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

05:11.486 --> 05:13.606
And they'll have a decent opera section?

05:13.686 --> 05:15.726
Opera? You like opera, really?

05:15.806 --> 05:17.046
I love opera.

05:17.086 --> 05:20.246
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

05:20.326 --> 05:22.206
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

05:22.286 --> 05:24.606
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.686
To the opera?

05:27.766 --> 05:30.206
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.766
It's La bloody Traviata.

05:32.806 --> 05:35.886
My God. I'd love to.

05:35.966 --> 05:38.806
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

05:38.886 --> 05:41.486
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

05:41.566 --> 05:45.726
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

05:47.846 --> 05:48.806
So?

05:48.886 --> 05:51.886
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

05:51.966 --> 05:54.046
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

05:54.126 --> 05:56.926
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.926
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

05:59.006 --> 06:01.766
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

06:01.846 --> 06:03.046
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

06:03.126 --> 06:05.766
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

06:05.846 --> 06:07.886
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

06:07.966 --> 06:10.526
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

06:10.606 --> 06:12.646
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

07:03.126 --> 07:07.046
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

07:07.126 --> 07:10.246
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

07:10.326 --> 07:14.686
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

07:14.766 --> 07:18.326
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

07:18.406 --> 07:21.046
Frighteningly so at times. But...

07:21.126 --> 07:24.126
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

07:24.206 --> 07:27.086
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

07:27.166 --> 07:30.126
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

07:30.206 --> 07:34.526
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

07:52.886 --> 07:54.766
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

07:54.846 --> 07:56.686
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

07:56.766 --> 07:58.926
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

07:59.006 --> 08:02.006
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

08:02.086 --> 08:04.526
It'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

08:04.606 --> 08:07.326
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

08:07.406 --> 08:10.206
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

08:10.286 --> 08:13.246
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.166
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.086
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.886
OK.

08:39.846 --> 08:41.126
Was I dreadful?

08:41.206 --> 08:43.966
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

08:44.046 --> 08:47.926
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

08:48.006 --> 08:50.326
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

08:50.406 --> 08:53.286
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.326
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

08:57.446 --> 08:59.446
It all came so easy at first.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.086
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

09:02.566 --> 09:04.086
I mean, it's OK for now,

09:04.166 --> 09:06.886
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

09:06.966 --> 09:08.806
I'd like to do something with my life.

09:08.886 --> 09:12.446
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

09:12.526 --> 09:15.766
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

09:16.126 --> 09:17.566
I love it.

09:17.646 --> 09:20.046
It's so exciting and alive.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.446
I've never seen so much art or theater.

09:22.526 --> 09:24.726
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

09:24.766 --> 09:27.446
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

09:27.526 --> 09:31.246
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

09:31.326 --> 09:32.566
That'd be great.

09:32.846 --> 09:36.606
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

09:36.646 --> 09:38.406
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

09:38.486 --> 09:41.246
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

09:41.286 --> 09:44.006
But actually,
I did read something about the...

09:44.086 --> 09:46.366
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

09:46.446 --> 09:50.326
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

09:50.366 --> 09:52.566
You're very kind to offer this.

09:52.646 --> 09:55.046
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

09:55.126 --> 09:56.806
OK, it's a deal.

09:56.886 --> 09:59.286
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

09:59.366 --> 10:00.846
I can do that.

10:00.926 --> 10:04.366
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

10:04.446 --> 10:07.206
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

10:07.246 --> 10:09.166
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

10:09.246 --> 10:12.406
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

11:08.846 --> 11:12.206
So who's my next victim?

11:13.406 --> 11:14.526
You?

11:15.126 --> 11:17.126
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

11:17.966 --> 11:20.686
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

11:22.486 --> 11:24.126
What did I walk into?

11:35.166 --> 11:37.486
What did I walk into?

11:38.806 --> 11:40.806
It's like this.

11:41.566 --> 11:43.606
- May I?
- Please.

11:45.406 --> 11:49.846
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

11:52.806 --> 11:55.686
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

11:55.766 --> 11:57.926
The story of my life.

11:58.006 --> 11:59.446
So, tell me,

11:59.486 --> 12:02.286
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

12:02.366 --> 12:04.606
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

12:09.406 --> 12:13.766
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

12:16.406 --> 12:19.326
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

12:23.526 --> 12:26.726
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

12:27.806 --> 12:29.806
Is it off-putting?

12:31.726 --> 12:34.246
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

12:37.726 --> 12:38.806
There you are.

12:38.886 --> 12:40.926
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

12:41.006 --> 12:44.046
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancée.

12:45.926 --> 12:48.326
So, you're the tennis pro.

12:48.406 --> 12:50.366
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

12:50.446 --> 12:52.806
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

12:52.846 --> 12:55.646
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.766
He's made a living out of hustling.

12:58.126 --> 13:00.846
I'll be ready for you next time.

13:02.686 --> 13:06.246
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.326
She's quite something, isn't she?

13:17.446 --> 13:20.526
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

13:20.606 --> 13:22.726
Jesus, yeah, six months!

13:22.806 --> 13:25.206
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

13:25.286 --> 13:27.366
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

13:27.446 --> 13:30.126
...one thing led to another.

13:30.886 --> 13:33.886
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

13:33.966 --> 13:35.486
that I'm serious about her, but...

13:35.566 --> 13:36.566
To be honest with you,

13:36.646 --> 13:38.926
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

13:39.006 --> 13:42.286
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

13:42.326 --> 13:44.446
Especially an American one.

13:46.046 --> 13:48.406
But I am crazy about her.

13:48.486 --> 13:52.166
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

13:52.366 --> 13:54.246
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

13:54.326 --> 13:57.846
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

13:57.926 --> 14:01.246
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

14:41.086 --> 14:43.726
These afternoons have been great.

14:44.486 --> 14:47.726
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

14:47.806 --> 14:49.406
Yes, it's fun.

14:49.486 --> 14:52.126
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

14:54.366 --> 14:56.366
Do you need money?

14:56.446 --> 14:58.246
God, no.

14:58.526 --> 15:00.126
No, I'm fine.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.886
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

15:09.046 --> 15:12.566
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

15:30.286 --> 15:33.126
Shall we go to your place or mine?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.446
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

15:35.526 --> 15:39.406
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

15:59.206 --> 16:02.726
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

16:02.806 --> 16:06.406
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

16:06.486 --> 16:09.246
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

16:09.326 --> 16:12.206
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

16:12.246 --> 16:14.526
Well, I find him very likeable.

16:14.606 --> 16:18.046
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

16:18.126 --> 16:22.406
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

16:22.486 --> 16:24.446
Can't we do something for him?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.846
A place in one of
your companies or something?

16:26.886 --> 16:28.206
Has he expressed a desire?

16:28.286 --> 16:31.926
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

16:32.006 --> 16:34.246
He really wants
to make something of his life.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.366
Chloe, be careful.

16:36.446 --> 16:40.366
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

16:40.446 --> 16:43.366
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

16:43.406 --> 16:45.286
She's spoilt and temperamental.

16:45.366 --> 16:47.206
She's an actress, they're emotional.

16:47.286 --> 16:50.526
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

16:50.606 --> 16:53.846
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

16:53.886 --> 16:56.246
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

17:09.046 --> 17:11.366
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

17:11.445 --> 17:13.925
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

17:14.006 --> 17:15.886
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

17:15.965 --> 17:17.886
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

17:20.086 --> 17:24.165
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

17:24.246 --> 17:25.806
Did you say anything?

17:25.886 --> 17:30.286
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

17:30.326 --> 17:33.166
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.926
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

17:36.006 --> 17:38.886
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

17:40.446 --> 17:42.446
Thanks.

17:42.526 --> 17:44.486
What do you think?

17:45.566 --> 17:47.566
I'm gonna have to think about it.

17:47.646 --> 17:50.446
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

17:53.006 --> 17:57.286
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

17:58.246 --> 18:00.046
I don't know, really.

18:02.126 --> 18:04.606
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

18:04.686 --> 18:06.406
I think it is.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.846
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

18:09.926 --> 18:13.566
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

18:13.646 --> 18:15.846
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

18:16.886 --> 18:19.766
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

18:19.846 --> 18:21.926
It's not exactly office work.

18:22.006 --> 18:25.486
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

18:25.566 --> 18:26.606
To?

18:26.686 --> 18:30.646
To a bigger job, more responsibility,

18:30.686 --> 18:33.646
greater earning potential, I don't know.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.766
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

18:39.526 --> 18:41.046
Of course.

18:41.126 --> 18:44.286
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

18:44.366 --> 18:47.486
I've always admired
men like your father.

18:47.566 --> 18:50.006
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

18:50.086 --> 18:52.126
Enjoying his fortune.

18:52.166 --> 18:55.366
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

18:55.406 --> 18:58.806
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.686
He's a very generous man.

19:00.766 --> 19:04.526
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

19:07.806 --> 19:11.046
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

19:11.126 --> 19:13.006
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.886
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

19:15.926 --> 19:19.566
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

19:19.646 --> 19:22.086
I will. I promise.

19:23.366 --> 19:25.206
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

19:25.286 --> 19:26.526
Hi, guys.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.926
Hello.

19:32.806 --> 19:35.406
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

19:35.486 --> 19:39.206
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.246
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

19:41.326 --> 19:43.126
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.406
Oh, God. Shut up.

19:44.486 --> 19:46.046
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

19:46.126 --> 19:49.246
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

19:49.326 --> 19:53.206
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

19:53.286 --> 19:55.486
I want an Aston Martin.

19:55.606 --> 19:57.446
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

19:57.526 --> 20:00.926
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.086
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.126
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.926
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

20:11.006 --> 20:14.166
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

20:14.246 --> 20:17.366
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

20:17.446 --> 20:20.046
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.486
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.286
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.686
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

20:28.766 --> 20:30.726
Nothing to start?

20:30.806 --> 20:32.406
Oh, I think the wine list.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.926
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

20:36.006 --> 20:38.806
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

20:38.886 --> 20:41.486
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

20:41.566 --> 20:43.286
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

20:43.366 --> 20:46.286
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

20:46.366 --> 20:47.886
"So-so."

20:47.966 --> 20:51.926
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

20:52.006 --> 20:53.886
He'll have the blinis.

20:54.006 --> 20:57.686
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

20:57.766 --> 20:59.726
He was kind of austere.

20:59.766 --> 21:01.926
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

21:02.006 --> 21:03.006
Oh, Christ.

21:03.086 --> 21:05.006
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

21:06.046 --> 21:09.486
God. Sorry, but it just
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

21:11.086 --> 21:12.846
What were you saying about Hedley?

21:12.926 --> 21:15.606
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

21:15.686 --> 21:17.526
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

21:17.606 --> 21:20.206
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.046
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

21:23.126 --> 21:26.926
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

21:27.006 --> 21:29.566
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

21:29.646 --> 21:32.246
It was a commercial, not a movie.

21:32.326 --> 21:35.126
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.886
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.366
Oh, you just need a break.

21:40.446 --> 21:42.566
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.766
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.606
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

21:46.686 --> 21:49.926
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

21:50.006 --> 21:52.206
I mean, it seems scientists are...

21:52.246 --> 21:56.126
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

21:56.206 --> 21:59.126
No purpose, no design.

21:59.726 --> 22:01.846
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

22:01.926 --> 22:03.806
And I envy you for it.

22:03.886 --> 22:06.886
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

22:06.966 --> 22:09.606
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

22:09.686 --> 22:12.086
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

22:12.166 --> 22:14.446
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

22:14.526 --> 22:15.806
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

22:15.886 --> 22:17.526
Can we change the subject, please?

22:17.606 --> 22:20.886
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.606
No, I was...

22:22.686 --> 22:27.286
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

22:27.366 --> 22:31.806
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

22:31.886 --> 22:34.526
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

22:34.606 --> 22:35.886
Ever.

22:35.966 --> 22:38.446
Have you decided on a wine?

22:39.366 --> 22:42.486
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

22:42.846 --> 22:42.966
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

22:42.966 --> 22:44.646
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

22:44.726 --> 22:45.926
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

22:46.006 --> 22:49.526
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

22:49.606 --> 22:50.846
Hi, Alan. How are you?

22:50.926 --> 22:54.526
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

22:54.606 --> 22:57.766
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

22:57.846 --> 22:59.806
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.566
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

23:02.646 --> 23:04.366
Now, if you're OK with the package,

23:04.446 --> 23:06.606
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.486
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

23:08.526 --> 23:10.606
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

23:10.686 --> 23:11.646
And Rod.

23:11.726 --> 23:12.926
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

23:13.006 --> 23:14.366
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

23:18.566 --> 23:21.566
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken that job.

23:21.646 --> 23:24.206
It's such good news.

23:25.606 --> 23:27.926
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.446
Wow. Thank you.

23:32.046 --> 23:35.006
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

23:35.086 --> 23:38.886
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

23:39.606 --> 23:42.606
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.646
It has some beautiful arias on it.

23:44.726 --> 23:46.446
And his voice expresses

23:46.526 --> 23:48.846
everything that's tragic about life.

23:49.566 --> 23:52.606
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

23:56.406 --> 23:58.366
I love it.

24:00.046 --> 24:04.606
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

24:06.406 --> 24:09.166
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

24:09.846 --> 24:11.806
Puligny-Montrachet.

24:11.886 --> 24:14.206
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.606
Now I'm addicted.

24:15.686 --> 24:18.406
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

24:18.486 --> 24:20.166
but I told them we're busy.

24:22.886 --> 24:24.886
But we have no plans.

24:24.966 --> 24:26.926
Well, no special plans.

24:27.846 --> 24:29.846
I thought we said we'd stay in?

24:30.566 --> 24:33.486
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

24:33.566 --> 24:35.166
We could've joined them.

24:35.246 --> 24:37.686
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

24:39.486 --> 24:43.126
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

24:43.886 --> 24:47.206
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.566
Well, shall I call them?

24:51.726 --> 24:54.286
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

24:55.646 --> 24:57.646
Well...

24:57.726 --> 25:00.606
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

25:00.686 --> 25:03.166
The wine, the opera.

25:04.206 --> 25:06.246
Absolutely.

25:15.726 --> 25:17.606
I just figured...

25:18.486 --> 25:21.246
We can stay in any... any night, and...

25:21.886 --> 25:24.326
...they're free and suggested a film.

25:24.406 --> 25:25.726
What's the film?

25:25.806 --> 25:28.446
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

25:30.286 --> 25:32.406
I am in the mood for a film.

25:37.606 --> 25:39.606
Thank you so much, fella.

25:40.326 --> 25:44.806
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

25:44.886 --> 25:47.046
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

25:48.686 --> 25:50.686
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.126
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

25:53.926 --> 25:55.166
Where is she?

25:55.366 --> 25:58.726
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.886
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.526
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

26:02.606 --> 26:05.726
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

26:05.766 --> 26:08.286
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

26:09.806 --> 26:12.126
Everybody likes you at work.

26:13.726 --> 26:16.766
Papa says he's heard great things.

26:18.926 --> 26:21.526
You're a very clever boy.

26:39.366 --> 26:40.846
Hey!

26:41.206 --> 26:42.566
Hey.

26:42.606 --> 26:44.246
- Hi.
- How are you?

26:44.326 --> 26:47.966
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

26:48.046 --> 26:50.846
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

26:51.326 --> 26:53.326
It's vicuña.

26:53.406 --> 26:54.846
- Vicuña.
- Vicuña?

26:54.886 --> 26:56.166
- Yeah.
- Right.

26:56.246 --> 26:57.286
Where are you going?

26:57.366 --> 27:00.046
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.086
- Why?
- So...

27:01.166 --> 27:03.646
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

27:03.726 --> 27:08.286
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

27:08.366 --> 27:12.006
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

27:12.086 --> 27:14.526
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

27:16.046 --> 27:19.046
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

27:19.126 --> 27:23.406
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

27:23.446 --> 27:26.526
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

27:27.446 --> 27:30.206
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

27:30.286 --> 27:32.366
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

27:32.446 --> 27:33.846
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.446
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

27:38.126 --> 27:39.806
Have you ever tried yoga?

27:40.446 --> 27:42.566
- No.
- No?

28:38.326 --> 28:39.806
Hi.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.846
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.726
- How was it?
- Blew that.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.006
It just works, you know, at home, but...

28:47.086 --> 28:50.686
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

28:51.246 --> 28:53.006
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

28:53.086 --> 28:54.406
Yeah.

28:55.606 --> 28:56.646
You know what,

28:56.726 --> 28:59.606
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

28:59.686 --> 29:01.126
...a little bit.
- Sure.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.166
- OK.
- This way.

29:14.766 --> 29:16.526
What was I saying?

29:20.206 --> 29:23.406
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

29:23.486 --> 29:26.166
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

29:26.566 --> 29:28.566
You should see my sister, she's...

29:28.646 --> 29:33.806
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

29:33.886 --> 29:36.646
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

29:38.366 --> 29:41.286
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

29:41.366 --> 29:43.126
My sister...

29:44.126 --> 29:46.966
...is classically beautiful.

29:49.326 --> 29:52.086
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

29:53.886 --> 29:57.046
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

29:58.766 --> 30:00.726
It's just a joke.

30:01.526 --> 30:03.326
What did your father do?

30:05.286 --> 30:08.126
He... left.

30:09.246 --> 30:11.766
And never sent any money.

30:11.846 --> 30:14.206
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.006
- No?
- No.

30:17.966 --> 30:20.446
Her problem was that she drank.

30:22.726 --> 30:24.726
How did you meet Tom?

30:28.446 --> 30:29.926
We met at a party.

30:30.006 --> 30:31.206
He...

30:31.286 --> 30:33.006
...saw me across the room

30:33.086 --> 30:37.326
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

30:37.806 --> 30:38.806
And I...

30:38.886 --> 30:40.726
I liked him right off, you know.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.606
I thought...

30:43.406 --> 30:45.606
Well, I think he's very handsome.

30:45.686 --> 30:46.926
Don't you?

30:47.006 --> 30:48.846
Very.

30:48.926 --> 30:51.166
And he asked you to marry him?

30:53.726 --> 30:55.446
Well, he...

30:55.526 --> 31:00.326
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

31:00.366 --> 31:02.326
What did I know
about that kind of life?

31:02.366 --> 31:05.526
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

31:05.606 --> 31:07.046
But...

31:07.526 --> 31:11.566
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

31:11.646 --> 31:15.406
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

31:15.566 --> 31:17.886
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

31:17.966 --> 31:20.926
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.446
It's such an inbred family. It's...

31:23.486 --> 31:25.886
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

31:30.446 --> 31:32.846
I thought he was very handsome.

31:32.926 --> 31:35.886
You know, and I told you I was just...

31:36.366 --> 31:39.406
I was overwhelmed with attention.

31:42.206 --> 31:44.686
So, what about you and Chloe?

31:47.726 --> 31:49.726
She's very sweet.

31:52.806 --> 31:54.806
She is very sweet.

31:57.086 --> 31:59.046
And she wants to marry you.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.726
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

32:01.806 --> 32:04.006
No. No, it's different.

32:04.086 --> 32:07.526
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

32:08.566 --> 32:10.566
...are being groomed.

32:10.646 --> 32:12.326
You mark my words.

32:12.366 --> 32:15.766
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

32:15.806 --> 32:18.486
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

32:18.566 --> 32:20.046
But...

32:23.046 --> 32:27.206
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

32:28.366 --> 32:30.406
And how am I going to blow it?

32:34.286 --> 32:36.406
By making a pass at me.

32:38.606 --> 32:40.966
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

32:43.206 --> 32:45.566
Men always seem to wonder.

32:47.406 --> 32:50.686
They think I'd be
something very special.

32:50.766 --> 32:52.726
And are you?

32:55.886 --> 32:58.726
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

33:02.086 --> 33:05.246
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

33:11.926 --> 33:14.046
I've had too much to drink.

33:15.566 --> 33:17.526
Can you get me a cab?

33:17.606 --> 33:19.606
Sure.

33:39.366 --> 33:40.846
Thank you.

33:41.406 --> 33:42.926
You were driving a bit fast,

33:43.006 --> 33:44.486
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

33:44.726 --> 33:47.446
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.486
Oh, hi.

33:48.566 --> 33:49.766
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

33:49.846 --> 33:51.886
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

33:51.966 --> 33:53.366
Oh, he's so sweet.

33:53.446 --> 33:55.366
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

33:55.446 --> 33:57.406
It should have dissipated fully already.

33:57.486 --> 33:59.726
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

33:59.806 --> 34:01.366
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

34:01.446 --> 34:04.326
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

34:04.406 --> 34:07.126
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

34:07.206 --> 34:09.045
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

34:09.126 --> 34:11.126
You're so beautiful.

34:11.206 --> 34:16.446
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

34:16.525 --> 34:18.806
that the company would pay for?

34:18.886 --> 34:20.446
I don't know.

34:24.166 --> 34:27.206
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.366
And the beginning of next year

34:29.446 --> 34:32.366
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

34:32.406 --> 34:36.366
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

34:36.446 --> 34:39.246
Plus, there are a number of perks...

34:39.326 --> 34:43.366
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

34:43.446 --> 34:45.966
We had been focusing on someone else...

34:46.886 --> 34:50.406
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

34:50.485 --> 34:53.846
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.485
I'd hate to disappoint you.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.286
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

34:58.366 --> 35:00.326
We're nearly ready.

35:00.406 --> 35:02.806
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

35:07.726 --> 35:08.766
Never mind, fella.

35:08.846 --> 35:12.446
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

35:12.526 --> 35:15.406
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

35:15.486 --> 35:17.926
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

35:18.006 --> 35:19.966
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

35:20.046 --> 35:22.206
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.246
Come on, Chloe.

35:26.806 --> 35:28.086
Hi, darling.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.766
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

35:29.846 --> 35:31.166
No.

35:31.246 --> 35:33.006
How did your audition go?

35:33.086 --> 35:36.366
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

35:36.406 --> 35:39.286
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

35:39.366 --> 35:42.206
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

35:42.246 --> 35:46.726
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

35:48.766 --> 35:51.046
So, how long do you keep it up?

35:53.366 --> 35:54.926
How long?

35:55.006 --> 35:58.286
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

35:58.366 --> 36:02.886
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

36:02.966 --> 36:05.646
To try something else?

36:05.966 --> 36:08.366
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

36:08.446 --> 36:09.446
I'm not saying that.

36:09.526 --> 36:12.206
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

36:12.286 --> 36:16.006
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

36:16.046 --> 36:20.206
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

36:20.246 --> 36:22.526
Well, I do ask myself that.

36:22.606 --> 36:24.726
See? It's only logical, Tom.

36:24.806 --> 36:27.086
Especially for a woman.

36:27.166 --> 36:30.006
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

36:30.086 --> 36:32.806
and as you get older and time passes,

36:32.886 --> 36:35.126
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

36:35.886 --> 36:38.726
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

36:39.686 --> 36:42.366
I'm not saying now.

36:42.446 --> 36:46.406
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

36:46.566 --> 36:49.486
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

36:49.566 --> 36:52.046
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.286
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

36:54.366 --> 36:56.406
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

36:56.486 --> 37:00.406
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

37:00.486 --> 37:01.846
...innuendos.

37:01.926 --> 37:04.566
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

37:04.646 --> 37:06.686
Those that have it, know it right off.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.286
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

37:09.366 --> 37:12.206
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

37:12.286 --> 37:14.286
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

37:14.886 --> 37:16.206
Excuse me.

37:16.846 --> 37:17.846
Nola.

37:17.926 --> 37:20.126
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

37:20.206 --> 37:23.126
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

37:23.206 --> 37:25.406
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

37:25.446 --> 37:29.006
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

38:44.846 --> 38:46.326
I was looking for you.

38:47.846 --> 38:50.486
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

38:50.566 --> 38:52.526
I don't mean to intrude.

38:53.766 --> 38:55.686
I need a drink.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.526
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

38:58.606 --> 39:00.566
- Do I?
- Yeah.

39:00.646 --> 39:03.006
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

39:03.046 --> 39:04.686
You shouldn't have followed me here.

39:04.766 --> 39:06.766
Do you feel guilty?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.046
Do you?

39:18.046 --> 39:20.046
We can't do this.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.686
I know.

39:29.886 --> 39:31.886
This can't lead anyplace.

40:47.766 --> 40:48.766
Hello.

40:49.846 --> 40:51.806
Darling, I think it's for you.

40:52.806 --> 40:54.686
But take it outside.

41:10.246 --> 41:12.326
Well, there's hope, at least.

41:12.406 --> 41:14.566
When's the callback?

41:16.646 --> 41:18.806
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

41:18.886 --> 41:22.086
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

41:23.246 --> 41:25.966
Yeah. OK.

41:26.046 --> 41:27.126
Bye.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.886
Why have you been so cold to me?

41:29.966 --> 41:32.686
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

41:32.766 --> 41:34.926
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

41:35.006 --> 41:37.406
you've been distant, evasive.

41:37.486 --> 41:39.606
I don't want to encourage anything.

41:39.686 --> 41:42.006
What happened, happened, Chris.

41:42.086 --> 41:45.046
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

41:45.126 --> 41:47.806
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

41:47.886 --> 41:50.606
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

41:50.646 --> 41:54.726
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

41:55.166 --> 41:58.086
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

41:58.686 --> 42:01.806
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

42:01.886 --> 42:04.686
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

42:04.726 --> 42:06.046
We had our moment.

42:06.126 --> 42:08.606
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

42:08.686 --> 42:10.926
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.966
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

42:14.046 --> 42:16.286
Chris, forget it. It's over.

42:29.366 --> 42:31.926
Thanks. Henry!

42:32.006 --> 42:34.646
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.246
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

42:36.326 --> 42:38.606
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

42:38.686 --> 42:40.406
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

42:40.486 --> 42:42.206
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

42:42.286 --> 42:44.646
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

42:44.726 --> 42:47.326
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

42:47.366 --> 42:50.126
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

42:50.206 --> 42:51.926
I just couldn't stand it.

42:52.006 --> 42:54.326
No. No, I heard you went into business.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.606
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

42:56.686 --> 42:59.126
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

42:59.206 --> 43:01.726
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

43:01.806 --> 43:03.406
Family's got nothing but money.

43:03.486 --> 43:06.646
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

43:06.726 --> 43:07.806
Hey, look, I understand.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.566
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

43:10.646 --> 43:13.166
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

43:13.246 --> 43:14.726
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

43:14.806 --> 43:16.726
I always admired
your game though, you know?

43:16.766 --> 43:18.206
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

43:18.286 --> 43:19.886
Cool under pressure, but creative.

43:19.966 --> 43:22.126
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.606
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

43:23.686 --> 43:25.486
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

43:25.566 --> 43:27.566
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

43:27.606 --> 43:29.926
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

43:30.006 --> 43:31.286
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

43:31.366 --> 43:33.046
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

43:33.126 --> 43:34.806
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

43:35.246 --> 43:37.886
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

43:37.966 --> 43:40.286
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

43:40.366 --> 43:41.526
So good to see you, Henry.

43:41.606 --> 43:42.966
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

43:43.046 --> 43:44.406
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

43:44.486 --> 43:46.526
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

43:46.606 --> 43:47.686
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

43:47.726 --> 43:49.606
- All right.
- Bye.

43:49.686 --> 43:51.046
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

43:51.126 --> 43:54.366
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

43:54.446 --> 43:56.446
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

43:56.526 --> 43:59.046
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

43:59.126 --> 44:00.126
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

44:00.206 --> 44:02.446
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

44:02.526 --> 44:04.566
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

44:04.646 --> 44:06.606
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

44:06.646 --> 44:07.646
Stop it.

44:07.726 --> 44:09.806
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

44:09.886 --> 44:11.646
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

44:11.726 --> 44:12.966
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

44:13.046 --> 44:16.446
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

44:16.526 --> 44:18.806
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

44:18.886 --> 44:21.926
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

44:22.006 --> 44:24.246
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

44:24.326 --> 44:25.726
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

44:25.766 --> 44:27.886
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.286
I appreciate that.

45:07.766 --> 45:09.926
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

45:14.246 --> 45:16.646
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

45:16.726 --> 45:18.846
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

45:18.886 --> 45:20.886
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

45:20.966 --> 45:22.326
It was all her fault, you know.

45:22.406 --> 45:25.166
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

45:25.246 --> 45:27.246
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

45:27.326 --> 45:29.726
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

45:29.806 --> 45:31.846
All men who see you want to attack you.

45:33.166 --> 45:35.126
Isn't that right, Christopher?

45:36.286 --> 45:37.766
Oh, God, are you all right?

45:38.646 --> 45:40.166
I'm fine.

45:40.246 --> 45:42.606
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

45:45.326 --> 45:48.566
I now pronounce you man and wife.

45:48.646 --> 45:50.686
You may kiss the bride.

46:06.646 --> 46:08.646
Oh, my God.

46:08.726 --> 46:10.966
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

46:12.006 --> 46:14.006
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

46:14.086 --> 46:16.046
There's another bedroom through there.

46:16.126 --> 46:18.086
The bathroom and a kitchen.

46:18.166 --> 46:20.206
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

46:20.246 --> 46:23.326
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

46:23.406 --> 46:27.046
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

46:27.086 --> 46:29.086
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

46:30.566 --> 46:33.926
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

46:34.006 --> 46:36.166
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

46:36.246 --> 46:38.246
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

46:41.046 --> 46:43.446
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

46:43.526 --> 46:45.526
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

46:47.286 --> 46:49.606
I want you to make me pregnant.

46:50.646 --> 46:54.006
Chloe... We discussed this.

46:54.046 --> 46:55.966
It's very quick.

46:56.046 --> 46:59.126
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

46:59.886 --> 47:02.846
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

47:04.966 --> 47:07.966
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

47:14.806 --> 47:17.406
Hey! Where are you?

47:18.726 --> 47:20.726
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

47:21.806 --> 47:23.486
Not good.

47:25.446 --> 47:27.446
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

47:28.206 --> 47:29.646
What?

47:30.206 --> 47:32.126
Well, Nola and I...

47:32.206 --> 47:34.006
...broke up.

47:34.086 --> 47:36.246
- No!
- Yeah.

47:36.326 --> 47:38.606
Or, I should say, I called it off.

47:40.486 --> 47:42.286
I thought you were gonna get married.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.526
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

47:44.566 --> 47:47.166
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

47:47.246 --> 47:50.366
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

47:50.446 --> 47:52.086
who's her main candidate.

47:52.446 --> 47:54.006
God, no.

47:55.126 --> 47:57.926
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

47:58.926 --> 48:01.406
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

48:01.486 --> 48:03.886
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

48:04.886 --> 48:06.886
...I've met someone else.

48:06.966 --> 48:09.006
- No!
- Yeah.

48:09.086 --> 48:13.286
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

48:13.366 --> 48:16.726
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

48:16.806 --> 48:20.086
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

48:21.166 --> 48:23.126
You know what I mean.

48:41.686 --> 48:44.606
The number you are calling
is not available.

48:46.326 --> 48:48.926
The number you are calling
is not available.

49:05.246 --> 49:06.326
Excuse me.

49:06.406 --> 49:08.846
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

49:08.926 --> 49:12.686
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

49:15.366 --> 49:18.246
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

49:19.566 --> 49:22.086
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

49:29.246 --> 49:31.966
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

49:32.806 --> 49:34.806
Just business.

49:39.166 --> 49:41.926
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

49:42.006 --> 49:44.486
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

49:45.966 --> 49:48.686
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

49:49.566 --> 49:51.806
OK, I can take a hint.

49:56.046 --> 50:00.486
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

50:00.566 --> 50:01.966
Look...

50:02.766 --> 50:04.366
...it'll happen.

50:04.446 --> 50:06.886
I'm just really tired.

50:07.566 --> 50:09.326
Kiss.

50:14.246 --> 50:15.806
Sweet dreams.

50:21.086 --> 50:24.046
I now pronounce you man and wife.

50:24.126 --> 50:26.246
You may kiss the bride.

50:36.526 --> 50:40.406
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

50:43.406 --> 50:43.446
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

50:43.446 --> 50:45.406
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

50:45.446 --> 50:46.646
I know.

50:46.726 --> 50:50.006
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

50:50.086 --> 50:53.086
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

50:53.166 --> 50:55.166
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

50:55.246 --> 50:58.686
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

50:58.726 --> 51:00.726
I want my own children.

51:01.286 --> 51:02.606
This one?

51:04.006 --> 51:05.006
Sort of...

51:05.086 --> 51:07.526
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

51:07.566 --> 51:08.766
Really?

51:08.846 --> 51:10.766
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

51:10.806 --> 51:12.846
Her and her husband
just found each other.

51:12.926 --> 51:15.886
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

51:15.966 --> 51:17.966
and it just works like a charm.

51:18.046 --> 51:22.246
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

51:22.446 --> 51:25.086
- God...
- I know, it's great.

51:25.886 --> 51:28.166
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

51:28.886 --> 51:31.806
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

51:31.886 --> 51:33.966
If I have to work all night.

51:34.046 --> 51:35.046
OK.

51:35.126 --> 51:37.246
Thank you. Thanks.

51:49.766 --> 51:52.006
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

51:59.886 --> 52:01.126
Thanks.

52:02.886 --> 52:04.686
Are you OK, sir?

52:07.126 --> 52:10.566
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

52:11.766 --> 52:14.326
No, not really.

52:17.886 --> 52:18.886
Oh, Christ!

52:18.966 --> 52:20.966
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

52:21.006 --> 52:23.046
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

52:23.126 --> 52:25.406
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

52:25.446 --> 52:27.006
Not before.

52:27.086 --> 52:28.846
Good night.

53:21.086 --> 53:24.086
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

53:24.166 --> 53:25.966
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

53:26.046 --> 53:27.526
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

53:27.606 --> 53:29.846
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

53:29.926 --> 53:30.926
Yeah?

53:31.006 --> 53:32.766
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

53:32.846 --> 53:34.726
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

53:34.806 --> 53:35.806
Why?

53:35.846 --> 53:38.766
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

53:38.846 --> 53:41.526
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

53:41.606 --> 53:42.606
I'm coming.

53:42.686 --> 53:44.246
- OK.
- OK.

54:44.126 --> 54:45.526
Hello.

54:47.086 --> 54:48.766
What a surprise.

54:48.846 --> 54:50.166
I...

54:50.246 --> 54:54.006
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

54:54.086 --> 54:57.766
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

54:57.846 --> 55:00.446
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

55:00.766 --> 55:04.766
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

55:06.246 --> 55:08.006
I looked for you.

55:08.686 --> 55:09.966
For what?

55:11.086 --> 55:13.086
You're still so angry.

55:16.406 --> 55:18.086
Where are you living?

55:18.926 --> 55:21.446
In town. Why?

55:23.086 --> 55:24.406
You live alone?

55:24.486 --> 55:28.006
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

55:29.486 --> 55:31.486
Can I meet you for a drink?

55:31.566 --> 55:33.406
Talk?

55:35.006 --> 55:37.846
Where can I reach you? Come on.

55:37.926 --> 55:41.086
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

55:41.166 --> 55:43.206
Look who I bumped into.

55:43.286 --> 55:45.446
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:45.526 --> 55:48.086
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

55:48.166 --> 55:50.446
- You look great.
- Thanks.

55:51.086 --> 55:53.206
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

55:53.286 --> 55:56.406
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

55:56.486 --> 55:59.086
Yeah. They've got a baby.

55:59.166 --> 56:01.286
You know Tom, all settled down.

56:01.366 --> 56:03.966
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

56:04.046 --> 56:06.366
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:08.286 --> 56:11.246
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.406
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

56:14.486 --> 56:16.806
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

56:16.886 --> 56:19.646
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

56:19.726 --> 56:21.126
Say your phone number.

56:21.206 --> 56:24.566
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

56:24.646 --> 56:26.286
- Chris...
- Please.

56:26.366 --> 56:28.446
Say your phone number.

56:32.566 --> 56:36.646
02079460996.

56:37.886 --> 56:39.606
I'll call you.

56:40.886 --> 56:41.886
Bye.

56:45.446 --> 56:47.446
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

56:47.526 --> 56:49.446
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

56:49.526 --> 56:52.206
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

56:52.246 --> 56:54.406
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

56:54.766 --> 56:55.766
It's OK, John.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.646
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

56:57.686 --> 56:59.446
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

56:59.526 --> 57:02.046
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

57:02.126 --> 57:03.286
- OK.
- See you at home.

57:03.366 --> 57:04.366
Bye.

57:37.926 --> 57:39.966
You have a very charming flat.

57:40.046 --> 57:42.846
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

57:45.006 --> 57:47.726
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

57:49.126 --> 57:50.566
I mean, it's not perfect.

57:50.606 --> 57:53.606
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

57:53.646 --> 57:55.766
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

57:56.606 --> 57:59.646
...you know, the lobby's decent.

58:00.286 --> 58:02.646
The key word is it's cheap.

58:03.966 --> 58:05.566
What time is it?

58:06.166 --> 58:07.766
Time for you to go.

58:09.326 --> 58:11.326
It's so hard to leave you.

58:15.606 --> 58:17.606
Beautiful woman.

58:22.806 --> 58:24.326
How'd you sleep?

58:25.486 --> 58:26.846
Good.

58:30.286 --> 58:32.686
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

58:32.766 --> 58:34.766
about that earthquake in China?

58:36.686 --> 58:38.366
Terrible.

58:40.486 --> 58:42.446
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

58:42.486 --> 58:45.446
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

58:45.526 --> 58:46.926
Yeah.

58:59.606 --> 59:02.686
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

59:02.766 --> 59:05.126
Papa's getting so into the idea.

59:05.406 --> 59:07.366
It should be good for you.

59:09.286 --> 59:11.726
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

59:13.286 --> 59:16.046
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

59:16.086 --> 59:18.086
...before you went to work.

59:18.646 --> 59:21.246
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

59:21.326 --> 59:24.766
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

59:26.646 --> 59:29.766
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

59:30.166 --> 59:32.486
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

59:45.326 --> 59:47.806
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

59:47.886 --> 59:49.326
Let me come up.

59:49.406 --> 59:52.286
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

59:52.326 --> 59:54.726
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

59:58.006 --> 01:00:00.246
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

01:00:03.286 --> 01:00:04.806
Come on.

01:00:10.126 --> 01:00:12.286
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

01:00:12.366 --> 01:00:14.726
Hey, did you get that pest control?

01:00:14.766 --> 01:00:15.966
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.486
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

01:00:18.566 --> 01:00:20.006
It's much better than cheese,

01:00:20.086 --> 01:00:22.406
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.886
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

01:00:24.966 --> 01:00:26.446
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

01:00:26.526 --> 01:00:27.726
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:28.766
Bye.

01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:04.086
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:06.206
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:07.766
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:10.206
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:11.526
Yeah.

01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:14.206
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

01:01:14.286 --> 01:01:16.206
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

01:01:16.286 --> 01:01:17.646
Heths didn't have a problem

01:01:17.726 --> 01:01:19.646
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:21.686
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:23.926
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

01:01:24.006 --> 01:01:25.166
- No.
- Yeah.

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.966
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

01:01:28.366 --> 01:01:30.966
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:33.646
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

01:01:33.726 --> 01:01:37.406
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.606
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

01:01:39.686 --> 01:01:42.046
But she's just such an odd girl.

01:01:42.086 --> 01:01:44.966
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

01:01:45.846 --> 01:01:47.846
But something's just...

01:01:47.926 --> 01:01:50.606
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

01:01:50.686 --> 01:01:52.206
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

01:01:52.286 --> 01:01:55.446
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

01:01:55.526 --> 01:01:57.286
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

01:01:57.366 --> 01:01:59.486
but, I don't know...

01:02:00.246 --> 01:02:02.846
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

01:02:03.606 --> 01:02:07.006
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

01:02:07.046 --> 01:02:09.126
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

01:02:09.206 --> 01:02:10.446
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:13.366
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

01:02:13.446 --> 01:02:16.286
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

01:02:16.326 --> 01:02:18.446
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:19.886
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:20.926
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

01:02:21.006 --> 01:02:23.086
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:24.486
I know Tom's dying to get away.

01:02:24.526 --> 01:02:26.126
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:27.206
Me?

01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:30.366
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:33.526
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

01:02:33.606 --> 01:02:35.366
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

01:02:35.406 --> 01:02:37.606
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:40.726
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

01:02:40.806 --> 01:02:43.206
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

01:02:43.246 --> 01:02:44.406
I'd have sworn it was you.

01:02:44.446 --> 01:02:46.606
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

01:02:46.686 --> 01:02:48.566
He's completely dependant on our driver.

01:02:48.646 --> 01:02:49.886
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:53.726
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

01:02:53.806 --> 01:02:56.966
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

01:02:57.046 --> 01:03:00.566
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:03.846
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

01:03:03.926 --> 01:03:05.286
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:06.726
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

01:03:06.806 --> 01:03:07.926
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

01:03:08.006 --> 01:03:08.966
Nuts.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.686
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

01:03:12.446 --> 01:03:14.606
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

01:03:14.686 --> 01:03:16.886
Just the Sarazin people at two.

01:03:16.966 --> 01:03:18.086
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:21.406
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:27.126
Chris. Where are you off to?

01:03:27.206 --> 01:03:29.286
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

01:03:29.326 --> 01:03:31.526
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

01:03:31.606 --> 01:03:34.526
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

01:03:34.646 --> 01:03:38.486
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

01:03:39.486 --> 01:03:41.326
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

01:03:41.406 --> 01:03:43.246
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:45.806
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

01:03:45.846 --> 01:03:47.366
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

01:03:47.446 --> 01:03:49.566
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

01:03:49.646 --> 01:03:51.526
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

01:03:51.606 --> 01:03:54.006
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

01:03:54.086 --> 01:03:56.446
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

01:03:56.486 --> 01:03:57.566
It's a hard field.

01:03:57.646 --> 01:04:00.126
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

01:04:00.206 --> 01:04:03.046
Tom's mother was right.
It just gets to a point, you know?

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:04.886
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

01:04:04.926 --> 01:04:07.926
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

01:04:09.126 --> 01:04:13.046
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

01:04:14.766 --> 01:04:16.766
Maybe I will.

01:04:18.926 --> 01:04:21.246
Don't say that unless you mean it.

01:04:22.766 --> 01:04:25.366
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

01:04:26.126 --> 01:04:28.486
I mean, it's... mechanical.

01:04:32.686 --> 01:04:34.886
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:39.206
Really. I mean it.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.726
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:46.486
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

01:04:46.566 --> 01:04:48.766
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:50.686
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

01:04:50.766 --> 01:04:51.926
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

01:04:52.006 --> 01:04:54.446
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

01:04:54.646 --> 01:04:56.166
Hi.

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:58.566
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

01:04:59.726 --> 01:05:02.166
I've been thinking about you.

01:05:04.486 --> 01:05:07.886
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:11.806
OK. See you then.

01:05:11.886 --> 01:05:13.446
Bye-bye.

01:05:14.126 --> 01:05:16.006
There you are, Chris.

01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:19.446
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

01:05:19.526 --> 01:05:21.286
over the past few months.

01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:24.286
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

01:05:24.366 --> 01:05:26.166
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

01:05:26.246 --> 01:05:28.046
Well, who could have predicted these?

01:05:28.126 --> 01:05:30.406
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

01:05:30.446 --> 01:05:33.326
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

01:05:33.406 --> 01:05:34.926
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

01:05:35.006 --> 01:05:37.046
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:42.206
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

01:06:42.286 --> 01:06:43.646
Yes.

01:06:43.686 --> 01:06:47.406
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:48.446
- Boat.
- Boat.

01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:49.726
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.166
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:52.486
- What?
- No.

01:06:52.566 --> 01:06:54.086
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:57.006
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

01:06:57.086 --> 01:06:58.086
Oh, that reminds me,

01:06:58.166 --> 01:07:00.606
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

01:07:00.686 --> 01:07:01.686
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

01:07:01.766 --> 01:07:04.286
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

01:07:04.366 --> 01:07:06.206
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

01:07:06.246 --> 01:07:07.246
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:07.326 --> 01:07:09.846
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:10.926
Oh, God.

01:07:11.006 --> 01:07:12.446
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:15.486
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

01:07:15.526 --> 01:07:17.406
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

01:07:17.486 --> 01:07:19.166
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

01:07:19.246 --> 01:07:22.166
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:25.246
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

01:07:25.326 --> 01:07:26.286
Poor thing.

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:28.966
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.046
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

01:07:30.126 --> 01:07:31.806
I miss you.

01:07:32.366 --> 01:07:34.606
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

01:07:34.686 --> 01:07:36.166
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:36.206 --> 01:07:38.366
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

01:07:38.446 --> 01:07:40.526
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

01:07:40.606 --> 01:07:42.206
When can you get here?

01:07:43.406 --> 01:07:45.646
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:47.046
Look...

01:07:47.726 --> 01:07:49.446
It's a three-day weekend.

01:07:49.726 --> 01:07:51.286
Tuesday.

01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:53.846
Chris, I need to see you.

01:07:55.006 --> 01:07:57.686
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

01:07:57.766 --> 01:08:00.206
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:03.246
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

01:08:03.326 --> 01:08:04.886
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

01:08:04.966 --> 01:08:07.366
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

01:08:07.406 --> 01:08:08.406
Jack Garner?

01:08:08.486 --> 01:08:10.526
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

01:08:10.606 --> 01:08:11.886
The traffic'll be terrible.

01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:14.366
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

01:08:14.446 --> 01:08:15.406
I don't mean today.

01:08:15.486 --> 01:08:17.166
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

01:08:17.246 --> 01:08:18.566
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

01:08:18.645 --> 01:08:20.446
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

01:08:20.526 --> 01:08:22.046
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

01:08:22.126 --> 01:08:23.886
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:24.966
That's mean.

01:08:25.526 --> 01:08:28.046
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:29.606
I've some lovely new horses.

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:31.286
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

01:08:31.326 --> 01:08:33.326
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

01:08:33.366 --> 01:08:34.486
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

01:08:34.566 --> 01:08:36.366
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.046
- No.
- Yeah.

01:08:38.126 --> 01:08:39.645
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

01:08:39.725 --> 01:08:40.845
- Where from?
- Anyway...

01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:43.326
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

01:08:43.406 --> 01:08:46.206
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

01:08:49.286 --> 01:08:50.805
Excuse me.

01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:54.126
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

01:08:54.206 --> 01:08:56.886
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.006
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

01:08:59.446 --> 01:09:00.446
Hello?

01:09:00.526 --> 01:09:02.685
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.126
Are you mad calling me here?

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.366
When are you coming over?

01:09:07.446 --> 01:09:09.446
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

01:09:09.526 --> 01:09:11.606
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:14.526
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:22.685
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:09:22.765 --> 01:09:25.246
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.406
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.086
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:34.685
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

01:09:34.765 --> 01:09:36.086
Well, they only had biscuits.

01:09:36.166 --> 01:09:38.526
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

01:09:38.606 --> 01:09:42.366
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

01:09:42.446 --> 01:09:45.566
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:47.926
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:50.246
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:52.486
It's no big deal.

01:09:52.566 --> 01:09:53.725
I'll pop back into town.

01:09:53.845 --> 01:09:57.806
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

01:09:57.886 --> 01:09:59.566
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

01:09:59.646 --> 01:10:01.246
Well, it is a pity because I...

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:03.526
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:04.966
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

01:10:05.046 --> 01:10:07.166
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.886
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

01:10:08.966 --> 01:10:10.446
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

01:10:10.526 --> 01:10:11.526
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:11.686
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

01:10:11.686 --> 01:10:14.366
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

01:10:14.446 --> 01:10:16.246
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

01:10:16.326 --> 01:10:17.886
but you couldn't wait.

01:10:19.806 --> 01:10:21.686
What unbelievable bad luck.

01:10:21.766 --> 01:10:24.566
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:26.446
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:28.326
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

01:10:28.406 --> 01:10:29.406
Is that your interpretation?

01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:31.566
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:34.206
not as part of some fertility project.

01:10:34.286 --> 01:10:36.206
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

01:10:36.286 --> 01:10:38.046
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:40.646
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

01:10:40.726 --> 01:10:43.246
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.126
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:47.166
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

01:10:47.246 --> 01:10:49.246
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

01:10:49.326 --> 01:10:52.246
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

01:10:52.326 --> 01:10:54.286
Why? You hate your job,
you hate your life.

01:10:54.366 --> 01:10:57.046
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

01:10:57.126 --> 01:10:58.806
Look, Nola, I have to go.

01:10:58.886 --> 01:11:00.846
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

01:11:00.926 --> 01:11:03.486
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:06.446
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

01:11:06.526 --> 01:11:07.766
Chris...

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:10.966
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

01:11:11.046 --> 01:11:13.566
I'm not walking away from this.

01:11:15.206 --> 01:11:18.166
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

01:11:20.486 --> 01:11:23.606
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

01:11:24.606 --> 01:11:26.726
Us.

01:11:27.206 --> 01:11:29.166
Is something wrong?

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.406
Yeah. There is.

01:11:34.886 --> 01:11:35.886
What?

01:11:35.966 --> 01:11:39.006
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.566
you know it's not a problem.

01:11:41.086 --> 01:11:43.766
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

01:11:44.886 --> 01:11:48.166
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

01:11:48.246 --> 01:11:51.766
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

01:11:54.766 --> 01:11:56.526
What is it?

01:12:01.046 --> 01:12:04.406
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:08.766
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

01:12:13.126 --> 01:12:15.526
Are you having an affair?

01:12:16.486 --> 01:12:18.726
Am I having an affair?

01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:20.886
Yeah, that's what I asked.

01:12:22.926 --> 01:12:25.286
- No.
- You are.

01:12:25.326 --> 01:12:27.526
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

01:12:38.326 --> 01:12:40.846
Do you not love me anymore?

01:12:43.046 --> 01:12:45.246
Of course I love you.

01:12:46.486 --> 01:12:48.646
Well, what's wrong?

01:12:51.846 --> 01:12:54.086
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

01:12:54.126 --> 01:12:56.166
You're not. How?

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.806
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

01:13:05.126 --> 01:13:07.126
I just...

01:13:07.766 --> 01:13:10.166
...feel so guilty.

01:13:10.966 --> 01:13:13.686
So terribly guilty.

01:13:13.766 --> 01:13:16.086
Listen, Chris.

01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:19.606
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:24.126
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:30.086
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

01:13:30.966 --> 01:13:35.806
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

01:13:37.766 --> 01:13:40.486
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.646
Oh, Chloe.

01:13:51.606 --> 01:13:53.846
Let's get off the subject.

01:13:53.886 --> 01:13:57.886
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

01:13:57.966 --> 01:14:01.726
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

01:14:05.366 --> 01:14:07.366
I had to talk to somebody.

01:14:08.646 --> 01:14:10.006
I'm really suffering.

01:14:10.086 --> 01:14:13.166
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

01:14:14.406 --> 01:14:17.406
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

01:14:18.806 --> 01:14:20.766
But when the time came to tell her...

01:14:21.806 --> 01:14:23.406
...I couldn't do it.

01:14:23.486 --> 01:14:25.966
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

01:14:28.126 --> 01:14:29.806
It's crazy.

01:14:31.086 --> 01:14:33.806
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

01:14:33.966 --> 01:14:36.246
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

01:14:36.326 --> 01:14:39.646
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:42.326
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

01:14:42.366 --> 01:14:44.086
Right.

01:14:44.806 --> 01:14:47.966
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

01:14:48.086 --> 01:14:50.566
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

01:14:52.846 --> 01:14:56.486
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

01:14:56.566 --> 01:14:59.966
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

01:15:00.646 --> 01:15:02.206
Is it for a woman you love?

01:15:02.286 --> 01:15:05.006
To live how? Where?

01:15:05.286 --> 01:15:08.286
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

01:15:08.326 --> 01:15:10.246
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

01:15:10.326 --> 01:15:13.406
There must be another job in another
firm that you can just, you know...

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:16.526
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

01:15:16.606 --> 01:15:18.726
And he loves me.

01:15:19.846 --> 01:15:22.326
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:24.966
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:27.846
We're going away for three weeks.

01:15:27.926 --> 01:15:30.966
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

01:15:32.006 --> 01:15:34.446
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

01:15:34.486 --> 01:15:37.806
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:40.046
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

01:15:40.126 --> 01:15:43.126
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:46.206
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

01:15:46.286 --> 01:15:47.686
which is all you ever tell me...

01:15:47.766 --> 01:15:50.526
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:53.806
It's a big blow.

01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:56.006
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

01:15:56.086 --> 01:15:59.446
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

01:15:59.526 --> 01:16:01.606
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

01:16:01.686 --> 01:16:04.286
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

01:16:04.366 --> 01:16:06.446
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

01:16:06.526 --> 01:16:10.766
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

01:16:10.846 --> 01:16:12.846
Hey, keep your voice down.

01:16:13.846 --> 01:16:16.086
You know I make love to her.

01:16:16.126 --> 01:16:18.646
And you know it's just routine.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:22.126
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

01:16:24.526 --> 01:16:26.126
Yeah.

01:16:27.446 --> 01:16:30.286
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

01:16:30.366 --> 01:16:32.006
It will.

01:16:33.366 --> 01:16:35.566
- It will.
- OK.

01:16:40.246 --> 01:16:42.006
The holiday's off.

01:16:42.086 --> 01:16:43.526
Why? What happened?

01:16:43.606 --> 01:16:45.766
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

01:16:46.766 --> 01:16:48.006
Why?

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:50.486
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

01:16:50.526 --> 01:16:52.326
Anyway, he needs recovery time

01:16:52.406 --> 01:16:55.646
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

01:16:55.726 --> 01:16:57.166
Let me just pack up my stuff.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.806
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

01:16:59.886 --> 01:17:01.566
Yeah.

01:17:17.606 --> 01:17:18.646
Hello?

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.646
Hello?

01:17:49.846 --> 01:17:51.686
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

01:17:51.726 --> 01:17:53.726
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

01:17:53.806 --> 01:17:54.806
Really?

01:17:54.886 --> 01:17:56.886
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

01:17:56.966 --> 01:18:00.086
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

01:18:00.206 --> 01:18:04.566
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.886
assuming our predictions are correct.

01:18:06.966 --> 01:18:08.366
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

01:18:08.406 --> 01:18:11.406
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:14.406
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

01:18:14.446 --> 01:18:16.526
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

01:18:16.606 --> 01:18:18.606
You already are a young grandmother.

01:18:18.646 --> 01:18:20.926
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:23.006
but I'd like you to be a mother.

01:18:23.086 --> 01:18:25.286
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

01:18:25.366 --> 01:18:28.526
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

01:18:28.606 --> 01:18:30.326
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.366
Great. You forgot.

01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:35.086
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:36.846
So my hints worked.

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:40.006
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

01:18:40.086 --> 01:18:41.086
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:43.406
- Hello?
- Chris?

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.726
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

01:18:44.806 --> 01:18:46.286
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

01:18:46.366 --> 01:18:47.966
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

01:18:48.046 --> 01:18:49.606
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.006
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

01:18:51.046 --> 01:18:53.326
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

01:18:53.486 --> 01:18:55.966
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

01:18:56.046 --> 01:18:57.366
I've been waiting a week.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.326
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

01:19:00.806 --> 01:19:02.446
When are you coming home?

01:19:02.606 --> 01:19:04.006
In about two weeks.

01:19:04.086 --> 01:19:06.726
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

01:19:06.806 --> 01:19:08.166
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

01:19:08.246 --> 01:19:10.046
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:12.006
OK. OK...

01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:13.926
Who is that? What country are you in?

01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:16.046
Your mobile's been impossible.

01:19:16.406 --> 01:19:18.566
I told you. I'm in Greece.

01:19:18.606 --> 01:19:21.086
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:23.766
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:26.766
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:28.246
Can you just?

01:19:28.766 --> 01:19:30.886
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.686
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

01:19:34.246 --> 01:19:36.046
Do you miss me?

01:19:36.126 --> 01:19:38.086
OK. Bye, bye.

01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:41.366
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

01:19:41.446 --> 01:19:43.166
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

01:20:09.766 --> 01:20:12.486
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

01:20:12.966 --> 01:20:14.486
Sardinia.

01:20:14.566 --> 01:20:16.846
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

01:20:27.526 --> 01:20:29.806
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

01:20:29.846 --> 01:20:31.646
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

01:20:37.926 --> 01:20:39.006
You lied to me.

01:20:39.086 --> 01:20:40.646
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

01:20:40.726 --> 01:20:42.206
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

01:20:42.286 --> 01:20:44.046
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

01:20:44.126 --> 01:20:45.086
Look, Christ, Christ.

01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:46.366
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

01:20:46.446 --> 01:20:47.686
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

01:20:47.766 --> 01:20:48.926
I can explain. I... Taxi!

01:20:48.966 --> 01:20:50.326
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

01:20:50.366 --> 01:20:52.606
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

01:20:52.686 --> 01:20:55.526
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

01:20:55.606 --> 01:20:57.086
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:59.646
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

01:20:59.726 --> 01:21:02.326
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

01:21:02.406 --> 01:21:06.246
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

01:21:06.846 --> 01:21:08.246
You're a liar!

01:21:12.166 --> 01:21:15.126
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

01:21:15.206 --> 01:21:17.006
I only came back
the day before yesterday

01:21:17.086 --> 01:21:19.246
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

01:21:19.326 --> 01:21:22.126
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:24.166
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

01:21:24.206 --> 01:21:26.006
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

01:21:26.086 --> 01:21:27.406
I was about to when you called.

01:21:27.486 --> 01:21:28.526
What does that have to do with anything?

01:21:28.606 --> 01:21:29.766
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

01:21:29.846 --> 01:21:31.366
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

01:21:31.446 --> 01:21:33.486
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

01:21:33.566 --> 01:21:36.206
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:38.726
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

01:21:38.806 --> 01:21:40.406
Well, she has to know eventually.

01:21:40.726 --> 01:21:42.686
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

01:21:42.766 --> 01:21:43.766
Nola, stop!

01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:46.086
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:47.726
We don't have to have a child together.

01:21:47.806 --> 01:21:49.566
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

01:21:49.646 --> 01:21:51.686
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

01:21:52.766 --> 01:21:55.046
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

01:21:55.126 --> 01:21:57.766
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.766
Nola, be reasonable.

01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:02.846
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

01:22:02.926 --> 01:22:05.086
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.486
So, you're threatening me?

01:22:06.566 --> 01:22:09.166
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

01:22:09.486 --> 01:22:11.086
Were you lying to me?

01:22:11.246 --> 01:22:12.646
All those times we made love,

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:15.726
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:18.326
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

01:22:18.406 --> 01:22:22.246
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

01:22:23.326 --> 01:22:26.966
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

01:24:22.086 --> 01:24:23.446
Have you seen Chris?

01:24:23.526 --> 01:24:25.526
A minute ago. He went that way.

01:24:25.966 --> 01:24:27.646
Chris?

01:24:28.446 --> 01:24:29.606
Chris?

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:32.566
Chris?

01:24:40.006 --> 01:24:42.126
Where are you, Chris?

01:24:43.406 --> 01:24:45.406
Chris?

01:24:48.406 --> 01:24:51.206
Chloe, are you there?

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.766
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

01:24:52.806 --> 01:24:55.126
No. Could you come up for a minute?

01:24:55.206 --> 01:24:57.806
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

01:24:58.446 --> 01:25:00.406
Yeah, OK.

01:25:25.926 --> 01:25:27.926
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

01:25:28.006 --> 01:25:30.726
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

01:25:30.806 --> 01:25:33.806
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

01:25:33.886 --> 01:25:35.886
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

01:25:35.966 --> 01:25:38.846
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:40.926
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:25:41.006 --> 01:25:43.766
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

01:25:43.846 --> 01:25:46.566
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

01:25:46.646 --> 01:25:48.166
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

01:25:48.246 --> 01:25:51.326
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

01:25:51.406 --> 01:25:53.886
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

01:25:53.966 --> 01:25:56.006
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

01:25:56.086 --> 01:25:58.606
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.766
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

01:26:00.846 --> 01:26:04.126
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.166
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

01:26:06.246 --> 01:26:10.446
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

01:26:10.526 --> 01:26:12.046
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

01:26:12.086 --> 01:26:15.646
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

01:26:15.766 --> 01:26:17.926
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

01:26:19.886 --> 01:26:22.406
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

01:26:22.486 --> 01:26:23.686
Did you hate it?

01:26:23.766 --> 01:26:26.406
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

01:26:26.486 --> 01:26:28.366
I thought you were gonna pass out.

01:26:28.406 --> 01:26:30.726
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:36.006
I still can't do it with you tonight.

01:26:36.046 --> 01:26:38.486
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

01:26:42.526 --> 01:26:45.726
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

01:26:45.806 --> 01:26:46.926
No. What are you doing?

01:26:47.006 --> 01:26:48.686
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

01:26:48.726 --> 01:26:50.686
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

01:26:50.726 --> 01:26:54.606
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

01:26:54.686 --> 01:26:56.406
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

01:26:56.486 --> 01:26:59.326
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

01:27:03.446 --> 01:27:04.446
Is this it?

01:27:04.526 --> 01:27:07.086
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:09.086
I've got to have words
with her about it.

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.766
It's really...

01:27:10.846 --> 01:27:12.566
What did you just put in your pocket?

01:27:12.646 --> 01:27:15.246
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

01:27:15.326 --> 01:27:16.686
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

01:27:16.766 --> 01:27:18.446
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

01:27:18.526 --> 01:27:20.086
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

01:27:20.166 --> 01:27:22.766
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

01:27:22.846 --> 01:27:24.046
- Guess what?
- What?

01:27:24.126 --> 01:27:26.526
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

01:27:26.566 --> 01:27:28.566
You haven't. That's not like you.

01:27:28.646 --> 01:27:30.886
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

01:27:30.966 --> 01:27:33.766
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

01:27:33.846 --> 01:27:35.566
No, that's not so.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:39.086
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:41.086
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.526
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

01:27:43.606 --> 01:27:45.326
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

01:27:45.406 --> 01:27:49.006
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

01:27:49.926 --> 01:27:52.046
You're so sweet.

01:27:52.126 --> 01:27:54.606
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

01:27:57.646 --> 01:28:00.446
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:02.326
OK, I will.

01:28:05.286 --> 01:28:07.966
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

01:28:09.286 --> 01:28:11.486
When you get off work today,
come right home.

01:28:11.566 --> 01:28:13.566
I have some good news.

01:28:14.806 --> 01:28:18.006
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

01:28:18.086 --> 01:28:19.966
You've got to meet me
right after work.

01:28:20.046 --> 01:28:22.726
We have... plans to make.

01:28:23.686 --> 01:28:27.006
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

01:28:27.086 --> 01:28:28.806
It's good. This is good.

01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:31.686
I'll see you soon. Bye.

01:28:31.726 --> 01:28:34.126
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:39.726
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

01:28:39.806 --> 01:28:41.966
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

01:28:42.046 --> 01:28:43.046
Yes.

01:28:43.126 --> 01:28:45.766
A half year should do it, maybe less.

01:28:45.806 --> 01:28:48.486
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

01:28:54.886 --> 01:28:56.606
Good.

01:28:57.886 --> 01:29:00.846
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

01:29:00.926 --> 01:29:03.006
for developing their capacity.

01:29:03.086 --> 01:29:05.606
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

01:29:15.486 --> 01:29:18.446
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

01:29:19.406 --> 01:29:22.966
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

01:30:29.566 --> 01:30:32.686
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

01:30:32.766 --> 01:30:35.406
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

01:30:35.486 --> 01:30:36.686
We met here last...

01:30:36.766 --> 01:30:39.166
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

01:30:39.246 --> 01:30:41.246
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

01:30:42.686 --> 01:30:45.886
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

01:30:45.926 --> 01:30:48.526
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

01:30:48.606 --> 01:30:51.606
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

01:30:53.526 --> 01:30:55.566
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

01:30:55.646 --> 01:30:57.046
Well, what's the trouble?

01:30:57.126 --> 01:30:59.966
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

01:31:00.006 --> 01:31:03.966
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

01:31:04.046 --> 01:31:07.526
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:08.606
Yes.

01:31:08.686 --> 01:31:12.646
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

01:31:12.726 --> 01:31:15.926
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

01:31:16.006 --> 01:31:18.006
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

01:31:18.086 --> 01:31:20.086
I have to take my medicine.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:40.046
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:06.086
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

01:35:48.566 --> 01:35:50.526
Mrs. Eastby?

01:35:53.686 --> 01:35:55.686
It's lan.

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:04.686
Mrs. Eastby?

01:36:09.486 --> 01:36:11.686
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

01:36:13.966 --> 01:36:17.446
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

01:36:21.766 --> 01:36:24.446
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

01:36:48.326 --> 01:36:49.286
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

01:36:49.366 --> 01:36:52.046
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

01:36:52.126 --> 01:36:54.166
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

01:36:54.246 --> 01:36:55.246
Excellent.

01:37:12.206 --> 01:37:14.646
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

01:37:45.246 --> 01:37:46.606
Nola.

01:37:56.926 --> 01:37:58.406
Excuse me.

01:38:07.846 --> 01:38:09.366
Hello.

01:38:10.086 --> 01:38:11.406
Where are you?

01:38:12.606 --> 01:38:15.166
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:48.326
- Good evening.
- Hello.

01:38:53.366 --> 01:38:55.406
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

01:38:55.486 --> 01:38:57.006
Two pounds.

01:39:02.126 --> 01:39:04.126
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:39:21.566 --> 01:39:23.166
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

01:39:23.246 --> 01:39:25.286
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

01:39:25.366 --> 01:39:27.366
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

01:39:27.446 --> 01:39:28.766
As he, or they, were running out

01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:31.326
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

01:39:31.406 --> 01:39:32.686
Either out of panic,

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:35.766
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:38.446
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

01:39:38.526 --> 01:39:40.646
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

01:39:40.726 --> 01:39:43.086
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

01:39:43.166 --> 01:39:45.526
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

01:39:45.566 --> 01:39:46.926
Probably cased her.

01:39:46.966 --> 01:39:49.366
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

01:39:49.406 --> 01:39:51.446
She picked the wrong time to come home.

01:39:51.966 --> 01:39:54.166
Some people just don't have any luck.

01:39:55.646 --> 01:39:58.166
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

01:39:58.246 --> 01:40:00.126
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

01:40:00.206 --> 01:40:01.806
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

01:40:01.886 --> 01:40:03.086
Do you need anything from the car?

01:40:03.166 --> 01:40:05.206
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

01:40:05.286 --> 01:40:08.526
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

01:40:08.606 --> 01:40:10.526
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

01:40:10.566 --> 01:40:12.286
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

01:40:12.366 --> 01:40:13.726
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

01:40:13.766 --> 01:40:16.526
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

01:40:16.606 --> 01:40:18.326
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

01:40:18.406 --> 01:40:21.046
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

01:40:21.126 --> 01:40:23.086
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:24.886
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

01:40:24.966 --> 01:40:26.086
No, hang on. If you just wait.

01:40:26.166 --> 01:40:28.526
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

01:40:28.606 --> 01:40:31.846
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

01:40:31.926 --> 01:40:34.406
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

01:40:34.486 --> 01:40:36.886
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

01:40:36.966 --> 01:40:38.846
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

01:40:38.886 --> 01:40:40.206
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

01:40:40.286 --> 01:40:42.446
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

01:40:42.526 --> 01:40:44.406
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

01:40:44.486 --> 01:40:46.926
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

01:40:46.966 --> 01:40:50.326
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

01:40:50.366 --> 01:40:52.406
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

01:40:52.486 --> 01:40:54.566
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

01:40:54.646 --> 01:40:55.926
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

01:40:56.006 --> 01:40:58.846
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

01:40:58.926 --> 01:41:01.006
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

01:41:01.086 --> 01:41:02.486
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

01:41:02.566 --> 01:41:05.926
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

01:41:06.006 --> 01:41:07.286
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

01:41:07.366 --> 01:41:09.046
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

01:41:09.126 --> 01:41:11.246
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

01:41:11.286 --> 01:41:14.286
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

01:41:14.366 --> 01:41:16.566
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

01:41:18.366 --> 01:41:20.606
Did you like the musical last night?

01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:25.246
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

01:41:25.326 --> 01:41:27.726
Yeah, he's very good.

01:41:28.366 --> 01:41:30.486
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

01:41:30.566 --> 01:41:32.606
Good.

01:41:35.406 --> 01:41:38.846
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

01:41:40.166 --> 01:41:43.166
Oh, my God! Nola!

01:41:43.246 --> 01:41:46.006
- Nola Rice.
- What?

01:41:46.326 --> 01:41:50.006
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:53.646
What? Here, let me see that.

01:41:53.726 --> 01:41:55.526
Jesus Christ!

01:41:59.486 --> 01:42:01.526
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

01:42:01.606 --> 01:42:05.566
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

01:42:05.646 --> 01:42:08.166
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

01:42:08.246 --> 01:42:12.206
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

01:42:12.286 --> 01:42:14.566
Oh, my God.

01:42:20.126 --> 01:42:21.646
Hello?

01:42:22.566 --> 01:42:25.286
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

01:42:25.326 --> 01:42:26.926
Isn't it just terrible?

01:42:27.006 --> 01:42:30.286
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

01:42:30.366 --> 01:42:33.366
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

01:42:33.486 --> 01:42:35.646
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

01:42:36.286 --> 01:42:37.966
I know.

01:42:38.006 --> 01:42:40.566
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

01:42:40.646 --> 01:42:42.406
Hello?

01:42:42.446 --> 01:42:44.966
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

01:42:45.046 --> 01:42:47.886
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

01:42:47.966 --> 01:42:49.326
I suppose she must've...

01:42:49.406 --> 01:42:52.046
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

01:42:52.126 --> 01:42:54.406
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

01:42:54.486 --> 01:42:56.206
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

01:42:56.286 --> 01:42:58.486
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

01:42:58.526 --> 01:43:01.806
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

01:43:01.886 --> 01:43:03.766
over the past year.

01:43:03.846 --> 01:43:06.486
Did you hear that? Yeah.

01:43:06.566 --> 01:43:10.926
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

01:43:17.246 --> 01:43:18.646
Mummy.

01:43:20.806 --> 01:43:22.806
I've got something to tell you.

01:43:22.886 --> 01:43:24.886
But I want Chris to be here.

01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:28.086
Chris?

01:43:28.126 --> 01:43:31.126
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

01:43:31.206 --> 01:43:33.206
He was just in here. Chris?

01:43:33.886 --> 01:43:35.886
Chris?

01:43:43.206 --> 01:43:44.566
He was just here.

01:43:44.606 --> 01:43:46.286
Well, what did you want to tell me?

01:43:46.366 --> 01:43:48.806
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

01:44:21.166 --> 01:44:23.326
Where are you? Chris?

01:44:24.846 --> 01:44:26.086
Well, what did you want to tell me?

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:27.846
Well, I just really want him to be here.

01:44:27.926 --> 01:44:30.246
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:32.926
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

01:44:33.006 --> 01:44:35.246
Well, I wanted you to be here.

01:44:35.326 --> 01:44:36.846
Well, what is it?

01:44:36.926 --> 01:44:38.406
Mummy...

01:44:38.486 --> 01:44:41.246
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

01:44:41.326 --> 01:44:43.046
It looks like I'm pregnant.

01:44:43.126 --> 01:44:45.366
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:49.246
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

01:44:49.886 --> 01:44:51.366
Alec?

01:44:51.446 --> 01:44:54.166
Alec? Come here.

01:44:54.366 --> 01:44:56.806
We're both walking on air.

01:44:56.846 --> 01:45:00.006
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:01.966
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:03.286
Chloe's pregnant.

01:45:03.366 --> 01:45:05.846
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

01:45:05.886 --> 01:45:08.286
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

01:45:08.366 --> 01:45:10.006
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

01:45:10.086 --> 01:45:11.046
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

01:45:11.126 --> 01:45:12.686
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

01:45:12.726 --> 01:45:15.126
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

01:45:15.166 --> 01:45:18.966
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:20.486
Thank you, Margaret.

01:45:21.406 --> 01:45:22.886
Sam?

01:45:22.966 --> 01:45:25.526
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

01:45:25.606 --> 01:45:27.486
Detective Mike Banner, called.

01:45:27.566 --> 01:45:30.686
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

01:45:31.166 --> 01:45:34.206
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

01:45:34.326 --> 01:45:36.246
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

01:45:36.286 --> 01:45:37.686
I bet it was that night...

01:45:37.766 --> 01:45:41.046
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

01:45:43.526 --> 01:45:47.006
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

01:45:47.086 --> 01:45:49.246
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

01:45:49.326 --> 01:45:51.526
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

01:45:51.566 --> 01:45:53.166
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:55.806
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

01:45:57.926 --> 01:46:01.126
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

01:46:01.206 --> 01:46:04.366
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

01:46:04.446 --> 01:46:07.246
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

01:46:07.326 --> 01:46:09.086
Detective Banner, please.

01:46:09.166 --> 01:46:11.166
This is Chris Wilton.

01:46:14.846 --> 01:46:15.846
Oh, hello.

01:46:15.926 --> 01:46:18.406
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

01:46:18.526 --> 01:46:21.366
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

01:46:21.446 --> 01:46:23.686
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

01:46:23.766 --> 01:46:27.166
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

01:46:27.246 --> 01:46:30.526
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

01:46:33.406 --> 01:46:35.606
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

01:46:35.686 --> 01:46:37.686
I certainly hope not.

01:47:44.246 --> 01:47:46.806
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

01:47:46.886 --> 01:47:49.886
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

01:47:50.806 --> 01:47:52.806
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

01:47:52.886 --> 01:47:56.926
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

01:47:58.526 --> 01:48:01.246
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

01:48:01.326 --> 01:48:03.686
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

01:48:04.286 --> 01:48:05.526
How?

01:48:06.446 --> 01:48:09.726
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

01:48:09.806 --> 01:48:11.526
That's...

01:48:12.206 --> 01:48:14.326
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

01:48:16.166 --> 01:48:19.406
They broke up. A year ago. More.

01:48:20.846 --> 01:48:22.846
When did you last see her?

01:48:23.766 --> 01:48:26.086
Oh, God, I can't remember.

01:48:29.526 --> 01:48:32.766
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

01:48:32.846 --> 01:48:35.286
But that was a long time ago.

01:48:37.126 --> 01:48:38.766
Have you seen her since?

01:48:39.166 --> 01:48:40.966
Not that I recall.

01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:45.366
Have?

01:48:46.566 --> 01:48:48.006
Have you ever seen this?

01:48:49.006 --> 01:48:50.966
No. What is it?

01:48:52.286 --> 01:48:54.886
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

01:49:04.406 --> 01:49:06.086
No.

01:49:07.086 --> 01:49:09.086
As you can see...

01:49:09.686 --> 01:49:12.086
...you're all over it.

01:49:19.326 --> 01:49:21.686
Yes, I can see that.

01:49:24.926 --> 01:49:27.126
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

01:49:27.206 --> 01:49:29.726
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:36.326
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

01:49:36.966 --> 01:49:39.326
But you people have to protect me here.

01:49:40.246 --> 01:49:43.046
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

01:49:43.126 --> 01:49:45.086
How long did your affair go on?

01:49:50.326 --> 01:49:53.206
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

01:49:54.006 --> 01:49:56.166
They broke up, she moved away.

01:49:57.246 --> 01:50:01.006
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

01:50:03.446 --> 01:50:05.406
God, have a heart.

01:50:06.206 --> 01:50:08.606
My wife is gonna have a baby.

01:50:08.886 --> 01:50:11.126
This will devastate her.

01:50:12.326 --> 01:50:13.726
Did you...

01:50:14.086 --> 01:50:17.966
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

01:50:18.366 --> 01:50:20.446
No, I did not.

01:50:20.806 --> 01:50:23.166
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

01:50:24.126 --> 01:50:27.406
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

01:50:32.846 --> 01:50:35.566
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

01:50:35.646 --> 01:50:37.886
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

01:50:37.966 --> 01:50:40.046
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

01:50:41.766 --> 01:50:44.726
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

01:50:44.766 --> 01:50:48.446
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

01:50:49.526 --> 01:50:53.126
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

01:50:53.206 --> 01:50:55.246
But you did lead her on,

01:50:55.326 --> 01:50:58.126
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

01:50:58.806 --> 01:51:01.086
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:03.926
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

01:51:04.806 --> 01:51:10.246
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

01:51:10.886 --> 01:51:13.726
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

01:51:13.806 --> 01:51:15.886
much less Nola Rice.

01:51:21.246 --> 01:51:24.166
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

01:51:24.206 --> 01:51:26.246
and she walked in when it was happening?

01:51:28.126 --> 01:51:31.646
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

01:51:32.046 --> 01:51:34.046
...wreck people's lives.

01:51:34.126 --> 01:51:37.206
My family, my marriage is at stake.

01:51:38.286 --> 01:51:40.926
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

01:51:41.006 --> 01:51:43.406
OK, but I'm not your man.

01:51:43.886 --> 01:51:47.126
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

01:51:47.206 --> 01:51:49.446
but that does not make me a murderer.

01:51:49.606 --> 01:51:52.526
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

01:51:52.606 --> 01:51:54.606
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

01:51:54.686 --> 01:51:56.286
And if we have to talk to you again,

01:51:56.366 --> 01:51:58.686
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

01:51:58.766 --> 01:52:00.286
Your personal life's your own.

01:52:00.366 --> 01:52:04.206
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

01:52:14.406 --> 01:52:16.486
I understand.

01:52:17.406 --> 01:52:19.046
Look...

01:52:19.126 --> 01:52:21.326
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

01:52:21.406 --> 01:52:23.406
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

01:52:23.486 --> 01:52:25.446
please call me on my mobile.

01:52:25.886 --> 01:52:27.926
This is my number.

01:52:29.806 --> 01:52:31.406
Thanks.

01:52:32.126 --> 01:52:33.086
One other thing.

01:52:33.166 --> 01:52:35.566
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

01:52:37.766 --> 01:52:39.206
Me?

01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:40.606
No.

01:52:40.686 --> 01:52:44.566
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

01:52:44.646 --> 01:52:46.806
You can check it out, but...

01:52:47.806 --> 01:52:51.766
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

01:52:51.846 --> 01:52:53.926
Of course.

01:52:56.926 --> 01:52:58.886
Thank you.

01:53:07.526 --> 01:53:09.526
So, what do you think?

01:53:10.046 --> 01:53:11.846
I think it's what it looks like.

01:53:11.926 --> 01:53:13.966
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

01:53:14.046 --> 01:53:17.606
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

01:53:18.646 --> 01:53:22.206
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

01:53:22.286 --> 01:53:24.286
He's 'specting a baby.

01:53:24.486 --> 01:53:26.886
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

01:53:28.046 --> 01:53:29.646
...we can find out discreetly enough

01:53:29.726 --> 01:53:32.726
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

01:53:34.606 --> 01:53:38.686
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

01:53:38.766 --> 01:53:41.566
never mind sawing one off.

01:53:42.406 --> 01:53:45.366
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

01:53:45.446 --> 01:53:47.166
Not even a speeding ticket.

01:53:47.246 --> 01:53:50.046
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

01:53:50.126 --> 01:53:52.446
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

01:53:52.526 --> 01:53:54.766
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

01:53:54.846 --> 01:53:56.326
Well, come on, Mike.

01:53:56.406 --> 01:53:58.246
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

01:53:58.286 --> 01:54:00.446
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

01:54:00.526 --> 01:54:02.846
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

01:54:02.926 --> 01:54:05.886
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:54:05.966 --> 01:54:10.566
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

01:54:10.646 --> 01:54:13.686
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

01:54:13.766 --> 01:54:15.606
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

01:54:15.686 --> 01:54:19.046
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

01:54:19.126 --> 01:54:21.406
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

01:54:21.486 --> 01:54:24.206
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

01:56:21.966 --> 01:56:23.646
Chris.

01:56:33.606 --> 01:56:35.366
Nola...

01:56:37.446 --> 01:56:39.686
...it wasn't easy.

01:56:40.646 --> 01:56:43.446
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

01:56:45.326 --> 01:56:48.326
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

01:56:49.926 --> 01:56:54.126
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

01:56:55.326 --> 01:56:57.086
You have to.

01:56:57.166 --> 01:56:59.686
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

01:56:59.766 --> 01:57:01.926
And what about me?

01:57:01.966 --> 01:57:04.726
What about the next-door neighbor?

01:57:05.486 --> 01:57:08.486
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

01:57:09.926 --> 01:57:14.846
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

01:57:16.766 --> 01:57:21.166
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

01:57:23.246 --> 01:57:25.486
You were collateral damage.

01:57:25.566 --> 01:57:28.046
So was your own child.

01:57:32.286 --> 01:57:34.286
Sophocles said:

01:57:35.766 --> 01:57:37.966
"To never have been born

01:57:38.566 --> 01:57:41.046
may be the greatest boon of all."

01:57:43.406 --> 01:57:45.726
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

01:57:46.646 --> 01:57:48.806
Your actions were clumsy.

01:57:48.886 --> 01:57:50.566
Full of holes.

01:57:50.646 --> 01:57:53.846
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

01:57:57.326 --> 01:58:00.326
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

01:58:00.366 --> 01:58:02.286
and punished.

01:58:03.406 --> 01:58:07.126
At least there would be
some small sign of justice.

01:58:07.206 --> 01:58:10.206
Some small...

01:58:10.886 --> 01:58:14.326
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

01:58:16.726 --> 01:58:19.886
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

01:58:19.966 --> 01:58:21.726
What?

01:58:22.926 --> 01:58:24.486
It's as we speculated

01:58:24.566 --> 01:58:26.966
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

01:58:27.046 --> 01:58:30.126
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

01:58:30.206 --> 01:58:31.886
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

01:58:31.966 --> 01:58:32.966
He waited in the hall.

01:58:33.046 --> 01:58:34.926
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

01:58:35.006 --> 01:58:38.286
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

01:58:38.366 --> 01:58:40.486
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

01:58:40.566 --> 01:58:42.806
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

01:58:42.886 --> 01:58:45.406
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

01:58:45.486 --> 01:58:46.966
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

01:58:47.006 --> 01:58:49.206
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

01:58:49.286 --> 01:58:51.046
and I am going to break this case.

01:58:51.126 --> 01:58:52.966
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

01:58:53.046 --> 01:58:54.006
What?

01:58:54.086 --> 01:58:56.046
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

01:58:56.086 --> 01:58:57.366
What's the bad news?

01:58:57.446 --> 01:59:00.326
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

01:59:00.406 --> 01:59:03.126
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

01:59:03.206 --> 01:59:06.446
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

01:59:06.526 --> 01:59:08.206
No, he didn't have to.

01:59:08.286 --> 01:59:11.486
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

01:59:12.166 --> 01:59:15.406
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

01:59:16.406 --> 01:59:19.606
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

01:59:19.686 --> 01:59:22.006
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

01:59:22.046 --> 01:59:24.326
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

01:59:24.646 --> 01:59:27.046
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

01:59:27.646 --> 01:59:29.646
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

01:59:29.726 --> 01:59:31.566
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

01:59:31.646 --> 01:59:33.966
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

01:59:34.046 --> 01:59:35.446
No, wait.

01:59:35.486 --> 01:59:39.486
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

01:59:40.926 --> 01:59:44.286
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

01:59:44.366 --> 01:59:47.086
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

01:59:47.166 --> 01:59:49.006
Come on.

01:59:50.366 --> 01:59:51.606
I give up.

01:59:51.686 --> 01:59:53.486
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

01:59:53.566 --> 01:59:55.886
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

01:59:55.966 --> 01:59:59.286
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

02:00:00.006 --> 02:00:02.766
What a world. Am I right?

02:00:03.246 --> 02:00:06.206
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

02:00:06.286 --> 02:00:09.286
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

02:00:09.366 --> 02:00:11.326
Right. Champagne.

02:00:11.366 --> 02:00:13.606
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

02:00:13.686 --> 02:00:16.046
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

02:00:16.126 --> 02:00:19.366
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

02:00:20.726 --> 02:00:22.286
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

02:00:22.366 --> 02:00:25.006
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

02:00:25.086 --> 02:00:28.566
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

02:00:28.646 --> 02:00:31.006
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

02:00:31.086 --> 02:00:32.566
Let's work on number two. Come on.

02:00:32.646 --> 02:00:36.006
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

02:00:36.086 --> 02:00:37.326
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

02:00:37.406 --> 02:00:39.446
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

02:00:39.526 --> 02:00:40.886
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

02:00:40.926 --> 02:00:42.446
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

02:00:42.526 --> 02:00:44.686
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

02:00:44.726 --> 02:00:45.726
Please do.

02:00:45.806 --> 02:00:46.886
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

02:00:46.926 --> 02:00:49.166
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

02:00:49.246 --> 02:00:51.646
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

02:00:51.726 --> 02:00:54.526
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

02:00:54.566 --> 02:00:56.126
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

02:00:56.206 --> 02:00:58.126
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

02:00:58.206 --> 02:00:59.526
I just hope that he's lucky.

02:00:59.606 --> 02:01:01.206
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

02:01:01.286 --> 02:01:02.606
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

02:01:02.686 --> 02:01:04.526
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

02:01:04.606 --> 02:01:07.446
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

02:01:07.486 --> 02:01:08.886
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

02:01:08.966 --> 02:01:10.246
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

02:01:10.326 --> 02:01:12.486
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

02:01:14.646 --> 02:01:16.046
What are you saying about him?

02:01:16.126 --> 02:01:18.126
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

02:01:18.206 --> 02:01:22.166
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

02:01:22.246 --> 02:01:23.526
I wonder what he's thinking.

02:01:23.566 --> 02:01:24.846
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

02:01:24.926 --> 02:01:26.566
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:28.566
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

02:01:28.646 --> 02:01:31.326
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
