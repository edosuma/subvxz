(Man) BIessed are those who can give

00:35.920 --> 00:40.630
without remembering,
and take without forgetting.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.153
Amen.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.593
(Mum) Amen.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.072
Thanks, Effy, but you know this is
the best birthday present I couId have.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.072
A nice famiIy meaI.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.515
A chance to have a bit of quaIity time.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.909
Ah, isn't that IoveIy?

01:01.480 --> 01:05.233
Ha, you know, this reminds me of when
I was a boy and my Auntie MabeI,

01:05.319 --> 01:06.673
when she was carving the chicken,

01:06.760 --> 01:10.719
she aIways used to wear
these Ioose-fitting tops...

01:10.800 --> 01:12.756
Yes, I think we've aII heard this one,
haven't we?

01:12.840 --> 01:15.149
It's a joke, Anthea, an anecdote.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.836
And my dad,
your grandfather, God rest his souI,

01:19.920 --> 01:22.639
''What wouId you Iike, David?''
she used to say,

01:22.720 --> 01:24.676
and he'd Iook right down her front and say,

01:24.760 --> 01:28.719
''I'd Iike breast, pIease,
and then maybe a bit of Ieg and stuffing.''

01:28.800 --> 01:32.315
LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

01:32.400 --> 01:37.952
I mean, he'd basicaIIy growI at her.
You see, that's a difficuIt dad.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.716
- No-one thinks you're difficuIt, Jim.
- Ha! And then MabeI wouId get to me.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.472
Ah, what couId I ask for?

01:44.560 --> 01:49.588
I scoured my brain and came up with,
''Thigh, pIease, MabeI.''

01:50.680 --> 01:54.673
I basicaIIy asked for the onIy thing
I couId think of that was non-sexuaI.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.672
- Thigh!
- Thighs can be sexy.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.038
That's not true.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.759
You'd be surprised,
you can do a Iot with thighs, Dad.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.274
No, you can't.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.272
CARVING KNIFE WHIRS

02:12.880 --> 02:15.553
Look, I'm sorry.
What is so sexy about thighs?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.949
I mean, what on earth
can you do with a thigh?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.474
PIease not... Not in front of Effy, Jim.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.713
AII right. What wouId everyone Iike?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.233
A bit of thigh, pIease, Dad.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.519
No! Not yet! Did I say do it yet?

02:36.600 --> 02:39.034
No, Iook, Jim! Effy's roIIed a five.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.591
Oh, yes, weII, er, right, weII, joIIy good.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.716
AII right, we'II treat that as your go, Effy.

02:45.800 --> 02:52.069
Er, so you got a five... Oh, God,
I can't understand these ruIes.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.833
They've transIated them from Korean.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.672
SIGHS HEAVILY

02:57.760 --> 03:00.797
Jim, maybe we shouIdn't pIay a game.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.314
Fine. Fucking fine.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.078
Fucking, fucking fine.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.639
So what shaII we do, then?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.199
Just sit, shaII we?

03:14.280 --> 03:19.115
Yes, we can just sit, yeah,
and I'II see if I can find some nice...

03:19.200 --> 03:20.633
biscuits, OK?

03:26.680 --> 03:30.229
Oh, I hate it when your mother's Iike this.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.917
(On TV) - HeIp me!
- What's wrong?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.752
Any Iuck with it?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.192
Never mind.

04:18.279 --> 04:19.759
Good night, Iove.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.831
Night, sweetheart.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.948
(On TV) There's nothing there.
What's wrong?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.393
RINGING TONE

05:18.480 --> 05:20.436
(Chris) 'Tony.
You aII right, man? How's it going?'

05:20.520 --> 05:22.238
What's everyone doing tonight?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.914
'Um, weII, there's a few peopIe
coming round to mine.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.754
'But it's a homework thing, reaIIy.'

05:28.840 --> 05:30.273
Is MicheIIe coming?

05:30.360 --> 05:33.830
'Yeah. Yeah, but it's for a cIass
that you're not in...

05:33.920 --> 05:35.353
'Um...

05:35.440 --> 05:37.192
'Er...bioIogy...

05:37.280 --> 05:38.998
'You're not in it.'

05:39.080 --> 05:41.833
It's fine, Chris.
I'm not invited, right?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.639
'I just... I don't think you'd enjoy it, reaIIy.
You know?'

05:44.720 --> 05:46.358
Yeah. I know.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.279
(Sid) 'I'm asIeep or just too bored
to speak to you, so Ieave a message.'

05:57.360 --> 06:00.477
Is this now officiaIIy siIent treatment
you're giving me?

06:00.560 --> 06:03.632
MicheIIe broke up with me, remember?

06:03.720 --> 06:07.554
StiII, if you think this is gonna piss me off,
then you're wrong.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.870
I actuaIIy quite Iike it.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.919
I'm just gonna keep on fiIIing up
your voicemaiI with aII sorts of shit...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.752
(Jim) I'm never neurotic.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.276
Dads aIways check up on their baby girIs,
that's what we do.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.148
Look, she's asIeep.
Come on, Iet's go to bed.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.196
Bed? But it's earIy.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.713
Panorama.

06:26.800 --> 06:31.828
I don't think that I've given you
<i>my</i> birthday present yet.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.388
- Auntie MabeI?
- Mmm.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.869
ActuaIIy, she was a neighbour,
not a reaI bIood reIative.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.633
I know exactIy what she was.

06:39.720 --> 06:44.191
I'II fetch the turkey baster
and you...wash your bits.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.830
(Maxxie) 'I dunno. I'm probabIy not even going.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.353
'You're breaking up, Tony.'

07:09.440 --> 07:11.829
FAKES INTERFERENCE

07:14.960 --> 07:17.838
(JaI) 'She doesn't want to see you, Tony.
Leave us aIone.'

07:30.360 --> 07:32.316
(GirI) I wasn't sure what to wear.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.749
Can you beIieve I borrowed
this top from my mum?

07:34.840 --> 07:38.753
Though Davey, when I wore
my mum's fishnets to the schooI disco thing,

07:38.840 --> 07:41.229
said that was weII rough
cos women used to wear fishnets

07:41.320 --> 07:43.754
without knickers at orgies or whatever,

07:43.840 --> 07:46.354
so, Iike, my mum wouId have got stuff on it.

07:46.440 --> 07:50.035
Davey caIIs it Iady juice.
Can you beIieve he caIIed it Iady juice?

07:50.120 --> 07:53.317
And he says by wearing the tights,
her stuff wouId have rubbed off on me.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.594
Though I wore knickers,

07:54.680 --> 07:58.389
and I don't think my mum
went to many orgies.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.914
I mean, she grew up in Luton.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.958
I don't think many orgies happen in Luton.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.870
Don't! He's gross!

08:18.280 --> 08:21.636
I'm a bit scared. Are you scared, Effy?

08:21.720 --> 08:24.154
I keep tasting sick in my mouth.

08:24.240 --> 08:29.234
I think it's cos I'm excited and nervous.
Do you ever get that?

08:29.320 --> 08:32.630
Tasting sick in your mouth,
Iike you've got hiccups but you haven't.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.676
Do you ever get that, Effy?

08:34.760 --> 08:36.477
Do you?

08:36.559 --> 08:39.711
Did I teII you about Davey
trying to finger me?

08:41.400 --> 08:43.118
Effy! You came!

08:43.200 --> 08:47.159
I mean, cooI, I mean...
I wasn't sure you wouId.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.955
Hi.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.476
It's my Iast day
and they're fucking wankers to work for.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.269
So you know, break, take, steaI...

09:08.360 --> 09:11.955
Anarchy and aII that. Mad.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.670
So this is it? ReaIIy?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.912
Oh, this is Spencer. A mate of mine.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.278
Hi, I'm JuIie and this is Effy.
Do peopIe caII you Spence?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.952
No. They don't.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.190
I've heard a Iot about you, Effy.
Not aII of it good.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.510
You heard anything about me?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.830
Wanna ride?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.678
ShaII I get on too?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.716
We're here together!

10:29.200 --> 10:31.873
- Big Issue!
- Bit Iate for you, isn't it, Kenny?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.757
Last week's edition.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.308
Drunks are usuaIIy
too generous to notice.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.674
Who you out with?

10:37.760 --> 10:40.274
On my own tonight. Listen,
you don't fancy a beer?

10:40.360 --> 10:43.079
Sorry, beer's not reaIIy my drink.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.948
Now, once you've tasted a Pinot Grigio,
hops just Iose their aIIure.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.156
Right, OK.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.752
Do you want a hand...seIIing?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.229
Where's aII your mates, then, Tone?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.197
FaIIen on hard times, have you?

11:01.520 --> 11:02.794
Something Iike that.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.519
WeII, no offence,
but the sooner I get these soId,

11:05.600 --> 11:07.875
the sooner I can get home
to the missus for cocoa and cuddIes.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.829
And I'm not going to get much soId
standing next to a posh Iad, am I?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.593
Right. OK. No worries.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.874
See you Iater.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.188
Ta-ta.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.273

SIREN WAILS

12:06.680 --> 12:10.036
(Spencer) It's the fucking cops!

12:11.480 --> 12:13.675

12:32.600 --> 12:34.591

12:43.440 --> 12:45.032
'Am I speaking to Tony Stonem?'

12:45.120 --> 12:46.519
What?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.637
CIifton Branch poIice station.
Marjorie Watts. How may I heIp you?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.917

12:54.520 --> 12:56.476
Marjorie Watts. How can I heIp you?

12:58.080 --> 13:01.914
Hi, Marjorie. I'm here to pick up
EIizabeth Stonem. She's been arrested.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.991
Okey-dokey. I'II check that for you.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.356
Just missed her.
Her brother's picked her up aIready.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.032
- I'm her brother.
- Her other brother.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.075
I'm her onIy brother.

13:15.160 --> 13:19.199
OK, her boyfriend pretending to be
her brother's picked her up aIready.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.113
She just Ieft with a fat Iad.

That was fun.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.637
Unexpected, but fun.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.917
- So fucking hard to keep a straight face.
- You did weII for a fat fuck.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.434
You're so Iucky, Effy.
I can't beIieve it.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.035
Remember when I tried to get arrested
for kissing that poIice officer?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.759
NormaIIy I wouId have been with her.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.752
We're aIways getting into troubIe

14:01.840 --> 14:03.558
Does she ever stop?

14:03.640 --> 14:04.834
Anyone want some?

14:04.920 --> 14:05.955
What is it?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.794
(JuIie) We're known as the cheeky girIs.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.077
Not that we're Romanian or,
you know, show off our pants!

14:23.800 --> 14:26.394
(Spencer) 'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currentIy cruising

SIRENS WAIL

14:52.440 --> 14:56.115
Look, oi! Can we get
some concentration here, pIease?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.556
I know it seems hard, right,
but think about it.

14:59.640 --> 15:04.031
This - this couId Iead to,
you know, ceIebrity.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.476
A pIace in the Guinness Book Of Records
is hardIy ceIebrity.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.994
But it is!
Right, I fucking Iove that book!

15:10.080 --> 15:11.638
WiII you stop eating the tooIs?

15:11.720 --> 15:16.316
It's not my fauIt you decided
to go for sugar cube pyramids.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.436
Oh, hi.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.270
What's this -
some kind of retro LSD thing?

15:29.040 --> 15:33.397
Oh, no. It's kinda that homework thing
I was teIIing you about...

15:33.480 --> 15:36.677
The, er...bioIogy.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.838
Hi, MicheIIe.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.953
HeIIo, Tony.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.635
Look, don't worry, I'm not gonna stay.
I just needed Sid for a minute.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.395

- Yeah, I can see that, Sid.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.351
Go on.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.795
Let's have a go, then.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.077
Ah...

Fucking heII, guys, you know
how to have a good time, don't you?

16:11.240 --> 16:13.549
I don't want this to be difficuIt.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.914
If you want to stay, you can stay.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.790
No, it's fine. You made the divorce terms cIear
and I intend to stick to them.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.359
PIease don't be a bastard.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.351
Look, don't get so upset about it, OK?

16:23.440 --> 16:28.309
I'm sorry I spoiIt your beautifuI evening.
I'II go. Sid?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.315
WeII, go on, then.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.231
Go see what he wants.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.231
Don't feeI you have to, Sid.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.755
I'm gonna go.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.752
But onIy to teII him to Ieave, right?

17:03.280 --> 17:06.113
You shouId Ieave, Tony.
No-one wants you here.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.189
Shit!

17:08.599 --> 17:09.919
You OK?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.037
I tried ringing, but you haven't
answered your phone aII week.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.998
- Did you get beaten up?
- Effy's missing. We need to Iook for her.

17:16.079 --> 17:19.038
Effy? Is this another one of your games?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.917
Yeah, Sid, it's a game.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.195
'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currentIy cruising

17:28.280 --> 17:30.794
'at 35,000 feet and there's
definiteIy turbuIence ahead.'

17:30.880 --> 17:32.438
This sounds a bit weird, Tony.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.273
It's fine. We'II nick your dad's car,
drive around a bit,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.351
spot her, take her home,
we can go for a pint.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.629
Shit!

17:42.720 --> 17:43.789
What?

17:43.880 --> 17:44.915
It's Cassie.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.039
- She was there.
- So where's she gone?

17:49.120 --> 17:53.159
FIown off on her broomstick?
She's stiII in the Ioony bin.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.958
No, she was there.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.998
Maybe she's haunting you,
cos she tried to kiII herseIf because of you.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.273
Hang on.
You want to nick my dad's car?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.790
Why can't we nick your dad's instead?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.919
Because, Sid, my dad has centraI Iocking,
a sophisticated aIarm system

18:11.000 --> 18:13.468
and probabIy thinks a speII
in prison wouId do me good.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.950
Whereas your dad has a 20-year-oId car,
Neighbourhood Watch

18:17.040 --> 18:18.519
and won't prosecute.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.159
LAUGHTER

19:09.560 --> 19:12.358
I bet you ten quid I know
who you're thinking about.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.557
There's times I think me and Tony
are gonna get back together.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.108
And just Iike that, I'm ten quid richer.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.633
There's a sort of thing, though,
isn't there? First Ioves?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.472
You think Tony Ioves you?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.309
No, I don't.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.358
Sorry, that sounded
far Iess harsh in my head.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.078
Don't worry about it.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.354
MicheIIe.

19:36.440 --> 19:42.310
Wait up. Listen, I'm off to a Iate-nighter
at the sports cIub. Fancy coming? A quick drink?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.277
- Can you not take a hint?
- Come on.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.238
You must have worked out by now
that I didn't do it.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.995
You had porno pictures
of your sister on your phone.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.559
How fucked up are you?

19:52.640 --> 19:56.076
- Someone set me up!
- Yeah, right, Josh.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.355
Look, the party'II be a Iaugh.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.672
MicheIIe! PIease!

20:06.080 --> 20:08.913
Fuck it. Go.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.353
Good decision.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.556
Fucked-up is an understatement.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.952
He's got nice wheeIs, though...
for a nutter.

20:17.040 --> 20:17.995
Shut up!

20:20.400 --> 20:23.472
- (Spencer) Home!
- (Kevin) This pIace is fucking briIIiant.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.028
(JuIie) It's Iike WonkaIand.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.395
(Spencer) This is where
the rich kids come to die.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.271
WeIcome to my worId.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.116
I feeI a bit rough!

20:49.200 --> 20:52.670
Kevin, I think you shouId take
JuIie to the bathroom.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.432
Come on. Let's get you cIeaned up.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.358
FinaIIy, we're aIone.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.714
Not quite.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.068
Jesus Christ.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.072
Fuck! I wondered
when you were going to turn up.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.596
HeIIo, Effy. I'm Jesus Christ.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.989
Anything?

21:26.080 --> 21:27.149
Nothing.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.117
BoIIocks!

21:29.200 --> 21:34.558
You know, she may be having a bit of fun,
a joke at your expense.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.154
That's not her styIe.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.151
No, I know Effy.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.276
She's cIeverer than this.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.476
In fact, she's the cIeverest
fucking person I know.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.074
I don't know anyone Iike her.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.037
(Sid) Cass?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.755
Look, I'm worried about her.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.991
I just... Even if we're Iooking
in the same pIaces twice...

21:56.080 --> 21:57.752
- Cassie, she was...
- PIease, Sid?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.673

'You've gotta come to this party
down at CumberIand Basin.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.591
'We're fIying the virgin highway.'

22:10.680 --> 22:13.990
- Who is this?
- 'Effy says hi.'

22:14.080 --> 22:16.196
What? Put Effy on the phone!

22:16.280 --> 22:18.077
HeIIo?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.957
Fuck! Come on, Sid.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.749
Looks a bit...spooky.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.637
You're not stiII afraid of the dark?

22:30.720 --> 22:32.472
You stiII sIeep with that
night Iight on, don't you?

22:32.560 --> 22:36.599
It's not a night Iight.
It's a gIow-in-the-dark Batman. It's retro.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.877
Effy!

22:39.960 --> 22:42.713

22:42.800 --> 22:45.155
Effy! Eff...y!

22:46.880 --> 22:48.950
No, I don't think she's here.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.793
- Doesn't Iook Iike much of a party, does it?
- No.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.037
Effy! Effy!

23:04.080 --> 23:05.479
OnIy if you want some.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.868
Course she fucking wants it.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.234
There we go.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.357
Dr Stock's marveIIous medicine.

23:27.800 --> 23:32.157
Sometimes I think I was born backwards,
you know?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.276
Come out of my mum the wrong way.

23:34.360 --> 23:38.353
I hear words go past me backwards.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.079
The peopIe I shouId Iove I hate.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.390
And the peopIe I hate...

23:55.360 --> 23:56.759
Ow! Fuck!

23:56.840 --> 24:01.277
AII the heIp I've ever given you,
and you've been fucking useIess tonight.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.554
I've been good.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.710
You've been useIess.
You're aIways fucking useIess.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.997
Take MicheIIe.
I worked fucking hard to create

24:08.080 --> 24:10.674
a shagging opportunity for you.
Then you went pussy.

24:10.760 --> 24:11.715
No...

24:11.800 --> 24:13.438
Instead, she ends up with this Josh,

24:13.520 --> 24:17.479
a compIete fucking knob,
who I have to sort, so that's your fauIt, too.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.199
Sort? What did you do?

24:20.280 --> 24:23.317
Put naked pictures
of AbigaiI on his phone.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.756
Made sure MicheIIe couId see them.
Made sure everyone couId see them.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.512
It was quite funny.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.194
Funny? That's sick.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.633
His sister. Why did you do that?

24:38.240 --> 24:39.355
You know what, Tony?

24:39.440 --> 24:42.318
Sometimes I don't know
why we're friends any more.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.992
It's weird, isn't it?

24:44.080 --> 24:45.957
I'm from Mars, you're from Venus.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.349
I do things, you worry about them.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.750
I sIeep with girIs,
you persuade them to attempt suicide.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.398
Don't.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.636
Are you bunching your fists at me, Sid?

24:58.720 --> 25:01.996
If you wanna hit me, go right ahead.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.033
Ow!

25:07.960 --> 25:09.757
I said a punch, not a bitch sIap!

25:13.680 --> 25:16.399
I can't beIieve you sIapped me!
That's hiIarious!

25:18.040 --> 25:20.474
Sid, you'd better not be crying.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.391
I'm not crying cos you punched me.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.994
You're crying for the kids in Africa?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.469
You know I used to so
Iook up to you, don't you?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.675
Of course I did!

25:35.160 --> 25:38.391
And now I can think of nothing worse
than being you!

25:43.600 --> 25:47.559
You've aIways been seIfish,
I aIways understood that.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.758
You did things because you wanted
something - fine. Makes sense.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.512
But now,

25:53.600 --> 25:56.273
now you do things because you can!

25:56.360 --> 25:58.749
You fuck with peopIe...

26:01.080 --> 26:03.674

26:03.760 --> 26:10.154
You've got no friends, no girIfriend,
onIy your parents Ieft.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.994
Not even Effy is answering your caIIs.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.593
You're right,

26:15.680 --> 26:17.238

You won't be taking her virginity.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.800
(Jim) Effy, Iove?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.438

38:00.520 --> 38:02.351
(Anthea) WeII, maybe best Iet her sIeep.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.839
She can hear you, Dad.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.911
That's enough from you.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.715
Doctor...

38:15.720 --> 38:17.153
Sorry, is she...?

38:17.240 --> 38:22.155
Oh. It's aII Iooking fine.
It's good, yes. I'd go as far as great.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.755
These kids are remarkabIy
resiIient creatures, you know?

38:25.840 --> 38:29.913
It's aII gone, and whatever hasn't
wiII be out in a few days.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.673
One way or the other.

38:32.760 --> 38:37.276
She took some very cIean,
pure pharmaceuticaIs.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.598
Right, OK. I'II Ieave you be.

38:49.240 --> 38:54.951
So I suppose we shouId congratuIate you
for getting her cIean drugs.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.793
You think this was me?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.757
She was with you!

38:59.840 --> 39:01.831
I wasn't, I was...

39:01.920 --> 39:03.148
Don't deny it!

39:03.240 --> 39:06.073
Tony, she's your IittIe sister!

39:06.160 --> 39:07.832
I know.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.148

39:09.240 --> 39:11.117
But, Iisten...for a second...

39:11.200 --> 39:15.398
No. I've had enough of Iistening to you.
We aII have!

39:15.480 --> 39:20.508
You and your horrid IittIe ways,
aIways at other peopIe's expense.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.036
Hang on. That's enough.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.792
What?

39:25.880 --> 39:28.348
He Ioves Effy.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.032
Don't you think this is hard enough?

39:30.120 --> 39:31.917
And who the fuck are you?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.150
I'm his best friend!

39:34.240 --> 39:36.071
And I'm his fucking father!

39:36.160 --> 39:37.878
I know what you are.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.670
Come on, Tony. We're going.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.273
I wanna stay with Effy.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.793
Come on, mate.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.672
Ah! Fuck!

40:12.600 --> 40:14.352
Thank you, Sid.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.557
It's OK. They're free.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.996
No, I mean reaIIy, thank you.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.638
Yeah, I know what you mean, Tony.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.909
- She's gonna be OK.
- Yeah.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.115
I'm sorry.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.633
OK.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.113
Thing is...

40:40.200 --> 40:42.395
I know I can be a wanker sometimes...

40:42.480 --> 40:46.678
but everyone Iikes that, don't they?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.958
BaII-busting,
turning heads wherever I go.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.358
PeopIe Iike that.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.911
- And I Iike peopIe Iiking that.
- We don't have to do this now.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.833
But then...

41:02.920 --> 41:06.754
I start to feeI...distorted because...

41:07.840 --> 41:09.398
..because I'm more than that.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.232
I don't wanna be a wanker.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.993
I don't, Sid.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.674
Effy knows that.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.671
She Ioves me for who I reaIIy am.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.992
God, I sound Iike fucking LioneI Richie.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.639
I quite Iike LioneI Richie.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.151
AII I know is,

41:39.240 --> 41:41.549

41:41.640 --> 41:45.189
and I was a bit...a Iot...

41:45.280 --> 41:46.713
I wanted you there.

41:48.360 --> 41:52.990
Effy's different. I sort of own her
cos she's my sister, but with you...

41:54.960 --> 41:56.791
I just reaIIy wanted you there.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.431
And then you were in the car.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.036
The thing is, Tony,

42:04.120 --> 42:05.758
you sort of own me, too.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.958
MostIy in a good way.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.233
Come on,
I'm taking you for breakfast.

42:16.680 --> 42:19.513
You do know it's 4am, don't you?

42:19.600 --> 42:21.750
Yeah, I know.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.991

42:25.080 --> 42:27.036
