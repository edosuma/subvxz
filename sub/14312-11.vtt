WEBVTT

00:25.614 --> 00:28.992
Montana's not gonna be happy.

00:40.045 --> 00:42.798
So this is why they tell you
not to play with fire.

00:48.136 --> 00:50.264
This is so not going well.

00:52.474 --> 00:53.767
- Hi.
- Right.

00:53.976 --> 00:56.895
Because things
weren't complicated enough.

02:02.669 --> 02:06.423
Listen, Molten Man. There are
innocent girls behind the counter.

02:06.632 --> 02:09.258
Like I'd fall for that old trick.

02:12.179 --> 02:15.474
O, is it all forgot?

02:15.682 --> 02:18.560
All schooldays' innocence,
childhood friendship?

02:18.769 --> 02:20.354
No, I mean:

02:20.562 --> 02:23.815
Schooldays' friendship,
childhood innocence?

02:24.024 --> 02:29.571
And will you rent
our ancient love asunder?

02:29.988 --> 02:31.156
You thief of love!

02:31.365 --> 02:34.951
What, have you come by night
and stolen my love's heart?

02:35.160 --> 02:39.581
Stop! Where is the passion? The pain?

02:39.790 --> 02:45.879
Ladies, your performance is
completely devoid of emotional truth.

02:46.713 --> 02:50.258
And why is my follow-spot
not following my performers?

02:50.467 --> 02:51.760
Where is Mark Allan?

03:02.938 --> 03:05.273
Couldn't spring for a sprinkler system?

03:05.482 --> 03:07.567
Hey, it's Montana's place.

03:07.776 --> 03:10.070
I'm just the manager.

03:27.504 --> 03:30.716
<i>I gotta get them out before they're hurt
or learn the truth.</i>

03:31.800 --> 03:34.177
<i>Okay, Parker, don't blow it.</i>

03:34.386 --> 03:37.764
<i>Time to step up and show Liz
the girl you care about most is...</i>

03:37.973 --> 03:40.392
- Gwen.
- Hi, Pete.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.852
Waiting for Liz?

03:42.185 --> 03:43.729
Yeah.

03:44.104 --> 03:46.273
You're waiting for Harry?

03:47.649 --> 03:50.444
- Maybe we shouldn't wait together.
- Yeah, maybe not.

03:58.201 --> 04:00.537
Liz, wait.

04:00.912 --> 04:04.458
Look, I know I've been
the how-not-to boyfriend lately.

04:04.666 --> 04:08.044
But I really, really wanna make things
right with us.

04:08.545 --> 04:09.796
Please.

04:10.005 --> 04:13.884
I want things right too, Petey.
It'd be nice if something felt right.

04:14.926 --> 04:16.887
Should I know what that means?

04:17.095 --> 04:19.305
I think my brother's in trouble again.

04:19.514 --> 04:23.477
- I noticed Mark hasn't been in school.
- Gambling. He swore he gave it up...

04:23.685 --> 04:26.563
...but I saw him talking to
Blackie Gaxton, his old bookie.

04:26.772 --> 04:29.858
And I found this in his jacket pocket.
It's a betting slip.

04:30.066 --> 04:34.029
Roosevelt Downs Racetrack.
Five thousand on Altierior-Motive.

04:34.237 --> 04:36.531
I looked the horse up online, it lost.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.826
Last time Mark was on a losing streak,
he stole a car...

04:40.035 --> 04:43.413
...to pay off his debts and wound up
doing six months in juvie.

04:43.622 --> 04:44.706
I'm so sorry, Liz.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.502
I wish there was something I could do.

04:49.044 --> 04:51.046
You already did.

04:54.257 --> 04:55.634
Couldn't help overhearing.

04:55.842 --> 04:59.137
Gwen, could you give us a second?

04:59.346 --> 05:01.097
Sure.

05:02.724 --> 05:07.062
Pete, when you're addicted
to gambling or (Bree--

05:07.270 --> 05:10.273
Or whatever, it's easy to backslide.

05:10.941 --> 05:13.276
Too easy. Trust me on this.

05:13.485 --> 05:16.696
No one can help Mark
until he's ready to help himself.

05:18.865 --> 05:20.617
<i>Harry's right. I can't help Mark.</i>

05:22.327 --> 05:24.788
<i>But maybe Spider-Man can.</i>

05:30.085 --> 05:33.964
Grab hold. Now give your friendly
neighbourhood Spidey a big hug.

05:34.172 --> 05:35.882
Whatever you do, don't let go.

05:36.216 --> 05:39.261
The girls, they are here.

05:42.138 --> 05:43.306
Itsy-bitsy.

05:43.515 --> 05:44.641
What about me?

05:50.772 --> 05:53.316
Where's me money, Marky?

05:53.525 --> 05:55.819
I don't have it yet.

05:56.027 --> 05:58.738
But there's this horse, Golden Chance.
It's a lock.

05:58.947 --> 06:02.075
It's always a lock with you, kid--

06:03.535 --> 06:05.036
Good news, low-lives.

06:05.245 --> 06:06.872
The city's gone green.

06:08.331 --> 06:14.462
Say hello to the new Big Man
of crime, the Green Goblin.

06:14.671 --> 06:17.924
Of course,
I can't abide divided loyalties.

06:18.133 --> 06:21.303
Show of hands,
who's still sweet on Tombstone?

06:21.511 --> 06:23.555
Hammerhead? Silvermane?

06:23.763 --> 06:29.227
Oh, don't tell me you like the Master
Planner and his wonderful personality?

06:30.437 --> 06:32.856
Wrong answer.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.734
Get him!

06:45.076 --> 06:46.912
Hold this, won't you?

06:52.375 --> 06:55.754
- You didn't want to play?
- Been a bookie long enough...

06:55.962 --> 06:59.466
-...to know a winner when I see one.
- Oh, good answer.

06:59.674 --> 07:03.136
You've just been promoted
to my first leftenant.

07:03.345 --> 07:05.889
And here's your first assignment.

07:06.097 --> 07:07.974
I need:

07:11.227 --> 07:13.813
Gobby, I got just what you need.

07:16.733 --> 07:19.819
- We can't go here. It's a police station.
- Relax.

07:20.028 --> 07:23.573
Cops haven't come near since getting
their fancy new Midtown digs.

07:24.616 --> 07:28.203
Gotta love the Goblin
for choosing it though.

07:28.411 --> 07:31.414
Take off your jacket and wait here.

07:36.378 --> 07:39.339
I don't appreciate last-minute changes.

07:39.547 --> 07:41.967
- Where's Hammerhead?
- Hammie's out.

07:42.175 --> 07:46.471
There's a new Big Man now,
but the deal's the same.

07:48.264 --> 07:50.058
I reviewed Dr. Octavius' notes...

07:50.266 --> 07:53.186
...on creating super mercenaries
with sub-dermal armour.

07:53.603 --> 07:57.774
The theory's sound, but his method of
introducing the sub-dermal particles...

07:57.983 --> 08:00.610
...led to the lab accident
known as Sandman.

08:00.819 --> 08:02.862
The key is nanotechnology.

08:03.071 --> 08:05.949
One simple infusion
of microscopic nanobots...

08:06.157 --> 08:09.869
...and the particles can be evenly
distributed throughout the subject.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.415
Whatever. Knock yourself out, doc.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.667
All right, Marky, shirt off.

08:17.377 --> 08:20.505
Sure he's a real doctor?
This place doesn't look sanitary.

08:20.714 --> 08:23.675
Don't worry.
The procedure is simple and painless.

08:23.883 --> 08:27.429
And the only way you get out
from under what you owe.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.889
Trust me, kid, it's a lock.

08:30.098 --> 08:32.267
So you all in or what?

08:32.475 --> 08:34.769
Yeah, I'm all in.

08:38.148 --> 08:39.691
Is that it?

08:43.236 --> 08:45.697
What's happening?

08:51.745 --> 08:54.414
The Big Sky is falling.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.294
Let me help.

09:01.963 --> 09:04.424
Stop, you're spreading the fire!

09:24.402 --> 09:27.155
Liz? Mary Jane?

09:27.739 --> 09:29.574
What did you do to me?

09:31.409 --> 09:33.453
How do I get this off? Tell me!

09:33.661 --> 09:38.291
Calm down, son. You can
control the armour with your mind.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.376
Just concentrate.

09:40.877 --> 09:42.337
Okay. Okay, okay.

09:42.545 --> 09:43.671
Go away.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.048
Go away.

09:45.465 --> 09:46.716
Go away.

09:49.761 --> 09:51.721
Very good.

09:51.930 --> 09:55.975
A strong-willed person can turn
the armour on or off at a thought.

09:56.184 --> 09:59.270
It's completely renewable
and virtually indestructible.

09:59.479 --> 10:01.731
Congrats, doc.

10:01.940 --> 10:03.399
What a success.

10:03.608 --> 10:05.777
So we're square now, right, Black?

10:05.985 --> 10:07.987
Sure, kid, we're aces.

10:08.196 --> 10:10.698
Here, take this and bet that horse.

10:10.907 --> 10:12.700
On me.

10:15.954 --> 10:17.872
That's some crazy luck, Allan.

10:18.081 --> 10:20.625
Cleared your debt,
survived the mad scientist...

10:20.834 --> 10:24.212
...and walked away with optional
super-skin and a cool hundred.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.048
Should really quit while you're ahead.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.968
But how do you quit
when you're on this hot streak?

10:30.176 --> 10:31.719
One hundred on Golden Chance.

10:31.928 --> 10:34.139
I'm all in.

10:44.732 --> 10:46.151
Easy, girl.

10:46.359 --> 10:49.696
<i>Mark's betting slip was from this track.
I can't stop him from gambling.</i>

10:49.904 --> 10:52.740
<i>But if I find him,
I can protect him from--</i>

10:53.533 --> 10:56.703
<i>Golden Chance takes an early lead,
trailed by Hopps-to-It.</i>

10:56.911 --> 10:58.204
Yes, Golden Chance!

10:59.581 --> 11:03.543
<i>Nicole-and-Dime has the inside rail,
but Golden Chance is pulling ahead.</i>

11:03.751 --> 11:06.462
<i>Wayne-in-Spain at the back,
joined by Randyman.</i>

11:06.671 --> 11:09.924
<i>Golden Chance leads the pack
by three lengths into the backstretch.</i>

11:10.133 --> 11:13.011
<i>- Go! Go, go!
- But Andy-Can-Cook is coming up fast.</i>

11:13.219 --> 11:15.430
<i>Nicole-and-Dime in third,
and closing in.</i>

11:15.638 --> 11:19.017
<i>Hopps-to-It moves back into second.
Here comes Wayne-in-Spain...</i>

11:19.225 --> 11:21.019
<i>...taking first.</i>

11:22.270 --> 11:24.856
<i>And Golden Chance comes in last.</i>

11:25.064 --> 11:27.442
No! I almost had it!

11:33.323 --> 11:35.617
What? But I didn't turn it on.

11:35.992 --> 11:39.037
Go away. Go away. Go away!

11:39.245 --> 11:40.455
No can do, buddy.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.207
Is it gone?

11:45.543 --> 11:48.338
<i>Okay, not who I was looking for, but...</i>

11:58.806 --> 12:00.767
Is that an Oscar with my name on it?

12:00.975 --> 12:03.645
I was thinking Emmy,
but spiders can't be choosers.

12:10.068 --> 12:11.194
Stay away from me!

12:16.658 --> 12:18.117
I don't have time for this.

12:18.326 --> 12:21.454
I gotta get Blackie
to get this stuff off me.

12:23.081 --> 12:26.334
<i>That voice, it sounds like Mark.</i>

12:43.393 --> 12:46.271
Liz? Mary Jane? Can you hear me?

12:53.569 --> 12:56.114
Don't touch him. He's red-hot.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.540
- Mark's not home.
- Then we can talk.

13:05.748 --> 13:09.252
I haven't seen Mark in three days.
What's going on?

13:09.460 --> 13:10.920
Like I'd confide in you?

13:11.129 --> 13:14.007
I know you're trying to split up
me and Petey for Gwen.

13:14.215 --> 13:17.093
And I'm supposed to believe you care
about my brother?

13:17.302 --> 13:20.096
Or did I misunderstand
your "un-relationship"?

13:20.305 --> 13:25.226
My feelings for Mark haven't been "un"
for a while now.

13:25.435 --> 13:29.814
And I'm really worried about him.
Liz, I think he's gambling again.

13:30.023 --> 13:33.443
He told you about that?

13:34.861 --> 13:37.113
Hands off, hot stuff.

13:41.242 --> 13:45.079
Oh, no, you all go ahead. I'll be fine.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.376
Get out. Get as far away--

13:50.585 --> 13:52.253
- We can't.
- We know him.

13:53.004 --> 13:54.422
- You do?
- No!

13:54.630 --> 13:57.175
You can't know me.
You can't see me like this.

13:58.301 --> 14:00.511
Step away from them, Spider-Man.

14:05.516 --> 14:07.685
Good. They're not a part of this.

14:07.894 --> 14:10.021
This is between me and you!

14:13.524 --> 14:17.195
Wait, now you can throw lava too?
I am so due for a power upgrade.

14:18.905 --> 14:19.947
Mark, stop!

14:20.156 --> 14:21.199
Let us help you.

14:21.407 --> 14:22.867
You don't have to do this.

14:23.076 --> 14:24.744
I'm sorry.

14:24.952 --> 14:26.662
But I do.

14:26.913 --> 14:29.582
What's wrong with this stuff?
I can't turn it off.

14:29.791 --> 14:31.959
Being a freak for life
wasn't part of our deal.

14:32.168 --> 14:35.713
The deal was you play guinea pig,
and you clear your debt.

14:35.922 --> 14:40.885
Not my fault you don't have the
mental focus to control your new skin.

14:41.094 --> 14:43.262
I'll show you mental focus.

14:44.555 --> 14:47.058
Perhaps it's time
we tell the boy the truth.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.187
You never controlled the armour.

14:51.396 --> 14:55.108
But you had to believe, or you wouldn't
have gone out in public.

14:55.316 --> 14:58.152
And then how would I have tested
my remote?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.991
Thank you.

15:04.617 --> 15:05.910
No, wait! Don't!

15:08.579 --> 15:12.041
So if you want to get your shiny
metal hands on this button...

15:12.250 --> 15:15.169
...and regain control of your life...

15:15.378 --> 15:20.425
...you'll need to do Gobby
one eensy-weensy favour.

15:20.633 --> 15:24.971
Eliminate Spider-Man.

15:28.599 --> 15:30.309
Eliminate Spider-Man?

15:30.518 --> 15:35.648
The other crime lords made the mistake
of trying to distract the web-slinger.

15:45.241 --> 15:48.578
I prefer a more direct approach.

15:48.786 --> 15:49.954
Then you take him out.

15:50.163 --> 15:55.001
Nothing would give me more pleasure,
believe me, but we'll stick to the plan.

15:55.751 --> 15:57.628
But I don't wanna mess with Spidey.

15:57.837 --> 15:59.255
He saved my sister's life.

15:59.464 --> 16:01.757
You'll get over those little qualms.

16:01.966 --> 16:06.929
Unless you want to wear
that tres chic fashion choice forever.

16:09.015 --> 16:11.726
Oh, please.
You're lucky I'm offering this deal.

16:11.934 --> 16:14.687
Your armour's unexpected heat
intrigues...

16:14.896 --> 16:18.983
...and I'm tempted to make the change
permanent just to learn the cause.

16:19.192 --> 16:20.735
You're a gambling man.

16:20.943 --> 16:23.654
Would you bet on duration
or frustration?

16:25.448 --> 16:27.325
There's a good flunky.

16:27.533 --> 16:30.244
And don't worry,
you'll get your life back...

16:30.453 --> 16:33.498
...as soon as Spider-Man's toast.

16:34.165 --> 16:36.000
But don't mention my name.

16:36.209 --> 16:39.629
I prefer to give anonymously.

16:48.930 --> 16:52.016
We have got to get us a new hangout.

16:55.770 --> 16:58.064
Just the Spider-Man I needed to see.

16:58.272 --> 17:01.150
Wait. I know you're in trouble,
but we can get you help.

17:01.359 --> 17:04.069
There's a doctor, a scientist,
Curt Connors. He--

17:06.739 --> 17:10.576
Think I've had enough of doctors
and scientists for one day.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.499
Take it easy, kid.

17:16.707 --> 17:21.921
- I just cleaned up the last mess.
- Chill, Blackie, this'll be over soon.

17:23.422 --> 17:26.300
Maybe you told the wrong guy to chill.

17:34.141 --> 17:35.935
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

17:36.143 --> 17:38.271
Feeling's mutual, yet here we are.

17:46.696 --> 17:47.822
Mark, let him go!

17:48.030 --> 17:49.365
Marquito, please.

17:52.535 --> 17:56.581
This isn't your business, Lizzie.
You shouldn't have come here.

17:57.248 --> 17:59.375
Maybe you told the wrong guy to chill.

17:59.584 --> 18:01.210
Is that Mark?

18:01.419 --> 18:03.129
We'd better get in there.

18:05.631 --> 18:08.050
Listen, I know you owe Gaxton money.

18:08.509 --> 18:10.886
No. Not anymore.

18:11.095 --> 18:13.723
I paid in gold.

18:13.931 --> 18:16.392
- That voice.
- Mark.

18:19.979 --> 18:22.565
This is why they tell you
not to play with fire.

18:27.945 --> 18:30.031
This is so not going well.

18:32.325 --> 18:33.951
Hi.

18:39.707 --> 18:42.168
Mark, listen. I know it seems hopeless.

18:42.376 --> 18:43.419
It doesn't.

18:43.628 --> 18:46.505
I get rid of Spidey, I get my life back.
It's a lock.

18:46.964 --> 18:49.008
It's always a lock with you, Mark.

18:49.216 --> 18:51.010
Quit gambling your life away.

18:51.218 --> 18:53.512
Sorry, but I'm all in.

18:53.721 --> 18:55.264
Then you leave me no choice.

19:01.937 --> 19:04.023
Never gonna nail me from a distance.

19:04.231 --> 19:06.942
I'm betting you're afraid
to get those hands dirty.

19:07.151 --> 19:09.195
That's a sucker's bet.

19:10.863 --> 19:13.991
That should cool him off.
And this should keep him that way.

19:35.638 --> 19:39.892
Oh, well, that's what I get
for betting on an amateur.

19:53.030 --> 19:56.534
I've read your notes. You're planning
to test sub-dermal armour...

19:56.742 --> 19:58.619
...on human test subjects?

19:58.828 --> 20:00.454
Planning, yes.

20:00.663 --> 20:04.542
The way you left these out, it's as if you
wanted me to find them so I'd stop you.

20:04.750 --> 20:05.960
Well, it worked.

20:06.168 --> 20:10.339
There is no way you're using my lab for
dangerous and unethical experiments.

20:10.548 --> 20:12.758
Except it's not your lab anymore.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.301
The board backs me.

20:14.510 --> 20:17.847
You think the board will back you
when they learn about this?

20:21.684 --> 20:25.521
Now, if you're smart,
you'll keep your forked tongue quiet.

20:25.730 --> 20:30.568
And slink off with your tail
between your legs.

20:37.074 --> 20:39.785
Montana's really not gonna be happy.

20:49.462 --> 20:51.964
Liz. I heard about Mark at the Bugle.

20:52.173 --> 20:54.759
Perfect. Take all the pictures you want.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.178
That's not why I'm here.

21:05.728 --> 21:07.188
O, is it all forgot?

21:07.396 --> 21:11.233
All schooldays' friendship,
childhood innocence?

21:11.442 --> 21:14.111
And will you rent
our ancient love asunder?

21:14.320 --> 21:16.071
You thief of love!

21:16.280 --> 21:20.367
What, have you come by night
and stolen my love's heart?

21:21.243 --> 21:23.245
Yes. Yes!

21:23.454 --> 21:27.625
Now I truly feel your pain.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.835
Oh, that was lovely.
