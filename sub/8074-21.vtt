00:03.771 --> 00:06.574
[theme music]

00:08.642 --> 00:10.044
Hey, I'm home.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.980
Hey, Darlene.

00:13.013 --> 00:13.947
Hello?

00:13.981 --> 00:16.350
Isn't anybody home?

00:16.384 --> 00:17.285
I'm right here.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.186
Mom?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.220
Dad?

00:19.253 --> 00:21.255
DJ?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.124
What?

00:23.157 --> 00:28.796
Oh, well I guess that means
I get the TV all to myself.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.198
Oh, golf!

00:30.231 --> 00:33.000
I was watching that!

00:33.033 --> 00:35.303
Hmm, that's odd.

00:35.336 --> 00:39.507
I'm all alone yet I
distinctly smell foul breath.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.743
That's cause I'm right here!

00:42.776 --> 00:44.912
Oh sorry DJ.

00:44.945 --> 00:49.016
I didn't see you, but then
I do have troll blindness.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.785
For god's sake, breathe
through your nose.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.821
Mom and dad are
planning something for you

00:53.854 --> 00:55.123
and I know what it is.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.959
Oooh, must be really
important if they told the dog.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.828
I heard mom and dad talking.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.331
Because of the new baby,
they're gonna cut your allowance

01:03.364 --> 01:05.833
from $100 a month to $50.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.868
No way.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.471
That baby's not going
to cost $50 a month.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.806
I mean, it's going to get
all it's food free from Elsie

01:12.840 --> 01:14.542
in there.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.776
Yeah.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.479
You're nailed and you
can't do anything about it.

01:18.512 --> 01:25.052
Oh, DJ, DJ, young, foolish DJ.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.621
You see, Roseanne and
Dan are like a VCR,

01:27.655 --> 01:32.860
they just flash zero
until you program them.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.663
Hey, hi Darlene, welcome home.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.632
Is, uh, Dad here?

01:38.666 --> 01:39.633
Dan?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.534
Dan: What?

01:40.568 --> 01:41.969
Yeah, he's here.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.337
OK, I wanna talk to you guys.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.238
Hey Darlene.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.539
What?

01:45.573 --> 01:49.277
Well, actually we want to
talk to you too, right now.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.812
Well, me first.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.648
Well, we shoulda
knew something bad

01:54.682 --> 01:58.085
like this would happen what with
her moving up to the big city.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.621
Yous tell us the boy's
name and I'll get my shotgun

02:00.654 --> 02:02.122
and your Ma will
rustle up the preacher.

02:04.992 --> 02:05.993
All right.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.761
Well I've been
thinking, I know you

02:07.795 --> 02:09.530
guys have this new
baby on the way

02:09.563 --> 02:12.032
and that's got to
be really expensive.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.636
So I was thinking you could
send me less money every month.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.538
[choking cough]

02:17.571 --> 02:19.607
You'll have to pardon us for
being a little shocked, this

02:19.640 --> 02:21.141
is your first act of kindness.

02:21.175 --> 02:24.978
Oh now Dan, come on she's
always been very generous.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.547
Remember when she
called up Jerry Lewis

02:26.580 --> 02:29.883
and pledged $100,000.

02:29.917 --> 02:34.322
So what do you say we cut
my allowance from $100 a month

02:34.355 --> 02:40.160
to, oh, say $75?

02:40.194 --> 02:41.229
$75, huh?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.463
No no, I don't want
to argue about this.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.732
This is what I want to do.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.235
That'd be good but you
know what'd be even better--

02:47.268 --> 02:50.238
No Dan, this is
so sweet of her.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.941
Well, I just figured the
baby needs it more than I do.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.545
Now what'd you guys
want to ask me?

02:57.578 --> 03:03.784
Well, um, you know that
Berlin Wall coming down?

03:03.817 --> 03:04.985
What was that all about?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.391
See ya.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.227
Like taking candy from
two very big babies

03:13.261 --> 03:15.596
who really like candy.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.197
Except for one thing.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.098
What?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.367
I lied.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.335
They were never gonna
cut your money at all.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.544
Listen, you know I
was just standing there

03:30.578 --> 03:32.580
and now I came in
here and I said that.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.316
I know, and we can't tell
you how much we appreciate it.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.450
But you know Darlene, I--

03:36.484 --> 03:40.654
I'm feeling so, um, I
don't know what it is--

03:40.688 --> 03:44.892
I'm just, uh-- oh my
god, I'm proud of you!

03:49.997 --> 03:53.534
I'll be in the basement,
plotting DJ's death.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.040
She fell right into our trap.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.576
Yeah, she must be slipping.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.211
OK, it worked.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.816
I did everything you said,
now where's my 10 bucks?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.084
You You fell right
into our trap.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.421
Yeah, he must be slipping.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.624
What a jip!

04:16.657 --> 04:18.025
And you wanted smart kids.

04:22.363 --> 04:26.266
[theme music]

05:10.778 --> 05:11.845
[knocking at door]

05:11.879 --> 05:12.680
Come in.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.120
Well someday maybe
they'll invent a receptacle

05:20.153 --> 05:23.657
where you can put garbage in.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.992
How are you doing?

05:25.025 --> 05:29.363
Well I'm right where I belong,
living on failure street,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.732
two blocks south of pathetic.

05:31.765 --> 05:36.670
My zip code-- all zeros.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.572
Now don't start that again.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.807
Fred's going to
come back to you.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.875
I had Dan go over
there and talk to him.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.043
And if that doesn't
work, then I'll

05:43.076 --> 05:44.311
send him back to beat him up.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.946
It's not going to work.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.381
Fred left me because
I lied to him.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.550
I went out dancing
with another man.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.952
Well dancing is not a sin.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.456
Didn't you see "Footloose"?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.291
Well if I just hadn't
have gone, then none of this

05:58.325 --> 05:59.760
would have happened.

05:59.793 --> 06:00.828
Hey come on.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.329
Once something goes
wrong in a marriage,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.532
it's never just one
partner's fault.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.133
You can't just blame yourself.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.936
Well I can't blame Fred.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.804
Well fine, then
blame someone else.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.839
That's what I do.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.141
Just make a list of
all your problems

06:14.174 --> 06:15.776
and then another list
of everybody you know

06:15.809 --> 06:19.012
and then draw lines.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.415
There's nobody
that I can blame.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.751
Well what about the idiot
that knocked to Fred?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.353
We were at the Lobo,
half of Lanford was there.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.555
That could have been anybody.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.190
Well that's all the
better, more to choose from.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.495
You know, Mom did see me
and Pete at the lunchbox.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.263
Oh that's perfect.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.499
Everyone knows she's pure evil.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.400
And she gave me
one of those looks.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.803
You know, like I'm
gonna tell on you.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.742
Well you didn't tell me
that you had hard evidence.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.077
God, I hate that mom.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.884
You know I do feel better.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.653
See, I told you, so now you
need to quit moping around

06:59.687 --> 07:01.489
and get out there
and have some fun.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.690
Although I wouldn't
recommend dancing.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.394
Well I--

07:07.427 --> 07:10.498
I could take Andy
to the bulk store.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.233
That a girl, nothing more
fun than the bulk store.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.837
But no, see, I don't
have any clean clothes.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.075
Could that somehow
be mom's fault?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.177
Damn her!

07:24.211 --> 07:30.083
[music playing]

07:30.117 --> 07:32.419
[knocking at door]

07:32.452 --> 07:33.253
Hold on.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.424
[knocking at door]

07:37.457 --> 07:38.258
Yeah.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.330
Gosh, I told the agency
I wanted a redhead.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.605
Dan what are we doing?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.507
You're checking out of here.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.744
Roseanne was right, this
crap has gone on long enough.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.612
You're going back your
wife and your kid.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.880
Come on, buddy, let's go.

07:59.913 --> 08:00.781
Can't.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.015
Why not?

08:02.049 --> 08:02.850
You packed my pants.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.724
Here.

08:10.758 --> 08:11.992
Dan, I'm not going back.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.426
I'm still too angry.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.728
I know you are
Fred, but it's just

08:14.762 --> 08:16.730
going to get better, trust me.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.832
You just bury that
anger deep down inside

08:18.866 --> 08:21.368
until it becomes a hard ball
in the pit of your stomach,

08:21.401 --> 08:22.469
and then you put food on it.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.676
No, I am staying where I am.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.545
Dammit Fred, what
are you doing here?

08:31.579 --> 08:34.347
I told you to romance her.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.216
With the money you spent
on this motel you could've

08:36.249 --> 08:41.188
bought her a card or something.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.856
Dan, I see what
this is about, OK.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.192
You don't have to worry,
Roseanne's not going to know

08:45.225 --> 08:46.827
it was you who tipped me off.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.596
I told Jackie it wasn't you.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.163
Oh, you don't
have to lie for me.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.398
I'm not afraid of my wife.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.365
Oh?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.802
Have you ever married?

08:54.835 --> 08:57.504
I'm not afraid because
I did nothing wrong.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.272
I'm not the guy that
walked out on his family

08:59.306 --> 09:00.340
to punish his wife.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.275
Hey, I'm not punishing her.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.878
Jackie is a mess.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.379
And she's sitting
home with a kid who

09:06.413 --> 09:07.981
doesn't know what happened
to his father, what

09:08.015 --> 09:08.882
do you call that?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.751
What do you want from me Dan?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.720
Jackie's the only
woman I ever loved,

09:12.753 --> 09:16.957
she's the only person I ever
trusted, and she betrayed me.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.391
But nothing happened.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.694
Something did happen-- she
went out with another man!

09:25.265 --> 09:27.200
I'm losing her.

09:27.234 --> 09:32.139
I lose her, I lose everything.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.474
I don't know what to do.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.444
Jeez Fred, I'm sorry.

09:37.477 --> 09:41.348
I just-- I need some time
to get my head together.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.484
All right buddy, I'll
stay with you for a while.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.793
Fred, does this is TV get
anything besides adult movies?

09:56.664 --> 09:59.066
I don't know.

09:59.099 --> 10:05.739
[music playing]

10:05.773 --> 10:09.109
Hey Roseanne, did I leave
Andy's little hat over here?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.645
Oh yeah, well, I'll
have to buy you a new one.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.982
Uh, see cause I ran
out of coffee filters.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.417
Hey have you had a bath?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.820
Yeah, I've been getting
out, trying to have fun

10:19.853 --> 10:20.721
like you said.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.155
But you still hate mom?

10:22.189 --> 10:25.025
Oh yeah, it's
very invigorating.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.728
You know it's funny, you
hate somebody your whole life

10:27.761 --> 10:30.898
and then you realize
there's so much more.

10:30.931 --> 10:31.999
Who do we hate,
who do we hate?

10:32.032 --> 10:32.900
Mom.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.367
Oh good, I hate
Bev, can I play?

10:34.401 --> 10:35.502
Yeah!

10:35.535 --> 10:38.605
We figured out mom told
Fred about me and Pete.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.074
So what do you think we
should do to her, Dan?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.575
Oh, I dunno.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.044
Who's to say what I think.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.278
Well, I got--

10:45.312 --> 10:47.414
gymboree starts in an hour,
I gotta get him there,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.950
build up his little muscles
cause next time he pulls out

10:49.983 --> 10:52.619
grandma's earrings, we
gonna do some damage,

10:52.652 --> 10:56.556
yes we are, yes we are.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.325
Oh, she's such a good mother.

11:01.729 --> 11:05.465
Listen Roseanne, I didn't want
to say this in front of Jackie,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.568
but I'm the one that
told Fred, not your mom.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.071
Although your mom probably
would have if I hadn't.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.341
Man, does she bug me!

11:14.374 --> 11:16.844
Well I should have seen
your great big barbecue

11:16.877 --> 11:19.179
stained fingerprints
all over this one.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.115
I was right to do it Roseanne,
I was right to tell him.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.383
I don't even want to hear it.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.485
You just go out in the backyard
and dig a great big hole

11:25.518 --> 11:28.088
and wait for me.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.824
Oh that's right, blame
me, blame the messenger,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.425
or no, no-- blame
Fred, you know,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.594
the guy whose wife lied to him.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.696
But whatever you do don't
blame the adulteress.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.365
Hey, she's not
an adulteress Dan.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.767
What-- what happened to you?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.568
You were on her side
before you went over there.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.370
Yeah, and them I saw
how much Fred was hurting.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.005
No, that's not what happened.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.174
You were in a very small
space with another man

11:47.207 --> 11:49.576
and you breathed
all those man fumes.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.711
And then the very tiny
part of your brain

11:51.745 --> 11:55.348
that can think for
itself dissolved.

11:55.382 --> 12:05.793
[music playing]

12:05.826 --> 12:08.161
Hey Fred.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.630
Heya, Mark.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.199
You here to meet Becky?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.967
No, she's eating
with that guy.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.435
Hey Becky, hey Joe.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.269
Hey.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.075
Who's Joe?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.144
Just some guy
friend of Becky's.

12:24.177 --> 12:28.148
They go out all the time, lunch,
dinner, dancing, no biggie.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.652
I see.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.553
And that doesn't bug you?

12:33.586 --> 12:34.521
Course not, man.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.257
I'm secure as a man.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.194
And my male chauvinistic
ego doesn't, uh,

12:41.228 --> 12:42.996
need, uh, something or other.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.735
You know that's
funny, I was recently

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
in a very similar situation.

12:50.804 --> 12:51.839
You were?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.373
I had no idea.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.808
Oh yeah.

12:54.842 --> 12:58.245
Only thing was that Jackie lied
to me about her guy friend.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.213
Does Becky ever lie
to you about this guy?

13:04.184 --> 13:07.821
Yeah, of course, all the time.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.256
Yeah?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.323
How does that make you feel?

13:12.792 --> 13:13.660
Ff-fine.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.296
Uh, Mrs. Conner!

13:16.329 --> 13:18.031
Really, fine?

13:18.065 --> 13:19.967
That is so open minded of you.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.601
I guess it won't bother
you to hear that they

13:21.634 --> 13:22.702
were holding hands too.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.837
What?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.338
Oh yeah, right up until
the minute you came in.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.773
I was a little
concerned about it,

13:26.806 --> 13:30.677
but I guess I'm not as
secure a man as you are.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.813
Hey, get away
from my wife pal!

13:33.847 --> 13:34.848
What are you doing?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.249
Were you holding
hands with this guy?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.150
No!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.485
Well, Fred saw you.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.354
Hey I told you,
if it is written

13:41.388 --> 13:43.423
on your hand don't say it.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.459
Nobody said nothing about
them touching each other.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.595
Why don't you go stick your
head in the freezer Mark.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.429
It's going bad.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.906
You think you and Jackie are
going to get back together?

13:58.939 --> 14:01.975
Roseanne, I can't believe
that you think that I was

14:02.009 --> 14:03.576
dumb enough to fall for that.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.611
I didn't.

14:04.644 --> 14:09.082
I am trying to break
up Becky and Mark.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.383
Hello, hello diner people.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.554
Hi, Bev.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.689
Ugh, I can't talk to Bev
right now with this Jackie

14:16.723 --> 14:17.824
thing going on.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.293
I'll get rid of her.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.129
(WHISPERING) Hi mom,
thank god you're here.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.164
You sure Fred
wants to talk to me?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.532
Yes, absolutely.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.667
I tried to comfort him but he
needs the kind of comforting

14:27.700 --> 14:28.902
that only you can give.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.240
Hello Fred.

14:38.545 --> 14:42.082
I was so sorry to hear
about you and Jackie.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.416
Where are you staying?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.717
The Green Lantern.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.254
Oh my, that place is filthy.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.923
But then, considering the
kind of housekeeper Jackie

14:49.957 --> 14:52.459
is, I suppose you
feel right at home.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.727
I don't know, I guess.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.429
Hey, hey, now's
not the time to bring

14:56.463 --> 14:58.231
up all of Jackie's faults, OK?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.800
Next thing I know you'll start
comparing her to, I don't know,

15:00.833 --> 15:01.701
dad.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.270
Ahaha, and why not?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.272
Jackie's father
was a cheater too

15:05.305 --> 15:07.407
and she always took after him.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.143
You know Bev, cheater is
probably too strong a word.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.580
Oh, really?

15:13.613 --> 15:16.116
Yeah, I mean Jackie
didn't actually

15:16.149 --> 15:17.884
do anything with this guy.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.187
That's right mom,
so there's absolutely

15:20.220 --> 15:24.424
no reason at all to bring up all
the other men she's slept with.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.226
Why waste the time?

15:26.259 --> 15:30.530
The list of men she hasn't
slept with is shorter.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.433
Bev, would you mind not
criticizing Jackie, after all

15:33.466 --> 15:35.435
she is still my wife.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.204
That's right mom
and she has obviously

15:37.237 --> 15:41.441
cut way back on the men
ever since she got married.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.812
In my day that woman would
become known as a runabout.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.547
She's not a runabout

15:47.580 --> 15:50.683
Exactly mom and I don't care
if she was wearing Charlie,

15:50.717 --> 15:54.321
you know, kind of
free, kind of wild.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.224
Goodness knows what sort
of life Jackie is leading.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.892
If you ask me, you're
too good for her.

15:59.926 --> 16:04.764
Will you get off Jackie's
case, she just made a mistake.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.899
Well you two can sit here
and argue about my sister

16:06.933 --> 16:08.235
all you want but
I'll be damned if I'm

16:08.268 --> 16:10.303
going to stand here and listen
to one more minute of it.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.805
And whatever you
do, do not tell Fred

16:12.839 --> 16:14.941
your theory on how
Jackie made ends meet

16:14.974 --> 16:15.975
that time she was unemployed.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.910
Oh!

16:17.944 --> 16:26.286
[music playing]

16:26.319 --> 16:27.287
[knocking at door]

16:27.320 --> 16:28.888
Yeah?

16:28.921 --> 16:29.922
Hi.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.158
Where you going?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.060
We are going to the toy
warehouse and the first toy

16:33.093 --> 16:36.829
he finds that he can't
break, I'm buying it!

16:36.863 --> 16:38.665
Hey, no, you got to
stay here because I just

16:38.698 --> 16:41.301
left Fred with mom and
I think he's caving.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.170
Really?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.504
Yeah, and so you
know, you've got

16:44.537 --> 16:46.839
to be here in case he comes
by or calls or something,

16:46.873 --> 16:50.243
unless mom turns him
off women all together.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.845
I'm all ready to go.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.548
Well come on Jackie, I went to
a lot of trouble catching him.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.617
Now you just got to
claim and cook him.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.253
I know, but its just
that ever since he left

17:00.287 --> 17:02.522
I've just been enjoying myself.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.723
(ANGRILY) What?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.558
Well I'm-- I'm sleeping
in the middle of the bed,

17:05.592 --> 17:08.928
I'm not shaving my legs, and
I get to put pretty clothes

17:08.961 --> 17:11.098
on Andy again. and
if he turns out gay

17:11.131 --> 17:13.133
we don't care because
I'll march in one

17:13.166 --> 17:14.201
of those parades with him.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.506
So, what about Fred?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.941
I mean, he's your husband,
don't you miss him at all?

17:21.974 --> 17:25.578
Not even the, you know, cute
way he does whatever it is

17:25.612 --> 17:26.646
that you thought he did cute.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.484
It's scary
Roseanne, I just think

17:31.518 --> 17:34.521
that I'm happier without him.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.423
Well, don't you
love him anymore?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.228
Huh, don't you?

17:41.261 --> 17:44.564
Ugh, I don't know.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.166
Well great, well you
better think about this

17:46.199 --> 17:47.300
because he's Andy's dad.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.536
I know, I know Andy needs him.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.771
[knocking at door]

17:51.804 --> 17:52.672
Hey.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.142
Hi Fred.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.076
Hiya sport!

17:57.110 --> 17:58.845
How you doing buddy?

17:58.878 --> 18:01.881
Who is that?

18:01.914 --> 18:05.051
Hey Roseanne, can you take
Andy in the back for a second?

18:05.084 --> 18:05.885
Yeah sure.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.656
Can we talk?

18:09.689 --> 18:10.490
Yeah.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.032
I made a mistake, I
shouldn't have left.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.668
No, you didn't
even let me explain.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.702
- I know.
- You know.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.572
I just, I needed
some time to think.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.775
Well I did too.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.444
Look, Jackie, I know
you've got some problems

18:31.478 --> 18:35.114
with the marriage and I do
too, but important thing is we

18:35.148 --> 18:37.217
still love each other, right?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.050
Right.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.326
Hi.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.694
So where were you two off to?

18:47.727 --> 18:48.661
Toy Warehouse.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.331
Oh, sounds like
fun, I'll join you.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.466
Oh I don't know, I have--

18:53.500 --> 18:56.236
let's just-- let's just stay in.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.470
Uh, well I--

18:57.504 --> 19:00.473
I better go because Darlene
hung DJ up by his feet

19:00.507 --> 19:01.408
and I want to get some film.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.979
Hey, um, thanks for
helping out Roseanne.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.215
Yeah, thanks.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.083
Yeah, well you
know, sometimes you--

19:11.117 --> 19:13.686
you go sticking
your nose in places

19:13.720 --> 19:18.157
where it doesn't belong so
things will turn out like this.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.198
[music playing]

19:30.136 --> 19:31.771
Dad, we need to talk.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.340
That's what I used to
think but it turns out,

19:33.373 --> 19:35.107
son, we don't.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.509
I mean it.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.279
I setup Darlene so you and mom
get to pay her less allowance,

19:39.312 --> 19:41.914
but unless you give me
10 more bucks a month,

19:41.948 --> 19:42.949
I'm going to tell her.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.287
My, my with a sly puss.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.857
Look, she'll start a big fight
and ruin our whole time home,

19:50.890 --> 19:54.961
and you don't want to
start a big fight, do you?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.897
Oh gee Dan, they're so
adorable before the horns

19:57.930 --> 20:00.233
and the pointy tail grow in.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.702
Hey Darlene, come on up here.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.904
Well, why do you want
to call her up here?

20:04.937 --> 20:08.775
It's the only fun we get since
they outlawed cockfighting.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.176
What?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.145
Well uh, say you
know that 25 bucks

20:13.179 --> 20:15.114
that DJ scammed you out of?

20:15.147 --> 20:16.015
Yeah.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.884
Well, that was
me and your dad.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.752
That was our scam, we
thought of that ourselves.

20:19.786 --> 20:24.724
And DJ, well he was nothing
but our willing stooge.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.859
So that wasn't
your idea at all?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.429
Nope, it was all mom and dad.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.797
So you were just
playing along?

20:30.830 --> 20:33.132
Yeah, that's right.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.469
You teamed up with them
you little snot factory!

20:36.503 --> 20:37.937
You know DJ,
for years we tried

20:37.970 --> 20:40.840
to get Darlene to help us scam
you, but she'd never do it.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.809
Well, she's got principles.

20:42.842 --> 20:47.647
Bad move DJ, because they're
going to die way before I do.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.950
Looks like the two of you got
a lot of things to talk over.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.319
Winner gets this $20.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.421
Someone get a shoe box,
there's going to be a funeral.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.422
Mom!

20:55.455 --> 20:56.889
Have fun kids!

20:56.923 --> 20:57.890
Dad, I'm scared!

20:57.924 --> 20:58.725
Perfectly natural.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.963
Well, well, what?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.666
We're reaming the kids together
again, does that mean we're OK?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.603
You know Dan, if
you weren't around

21:10.637 --> 21:12.271
here I would really miss you.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.673
Well, of course.

21:13.706 --> 21:17.577
You'd keep sliding down in the
middle where the mattress dips.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.278
No, I mean it.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.114
Um, I'm really glad
that I married you.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.984
And I know I got me
one of the good ones.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.387
Am I dying?

21:27.420 --> 21:28.321
Never mind.
