I love your mustache.
Oh.

09:01.630 --> 09:03.233
Thank you very much.
Be careful, though,

09:03.233 --> 09:04.837
a couple of drinks
and it gets kind of crazy.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.640
That's my kind of mustache.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.109
(chuckles)
Can I get it, or you,

09:08.109 --> 09:10.582
a drink?
Or anything else?

09:10.582 --> 09:12.251
Anything?
Mm‐hmm.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.855
That doesn't really narrow
it down, now does it?

09:13.855 --> 09:15.257
That's the idea
at these parties.

09:15.257 --> 09:17.027
Ah, who's idea is that?

09:17.027 --> 09:18.029
Dylan?

09:18.029 --> 09:19.733
Well, it's Dylan's place,

09:19.733 --> 09:21.537

09:49.058 --> 09:51.664
Detective
Roger Murtaugh, LAPD.

09:51.664 --> 09:53.668
What, are you part of the
security detail for the party?

09:53.668 --> 09:54.469
Talk to Julian.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.205
He handles all that.
No, I'm here

09:56.205 --> 09:58.209
investigating a homicide.

09:58.209 --> 10:00.213
Young lady named
Ms. Nina Clausen.

10:00.213 --> 10:02.151
Does that name
ring a bell?

10:02.151 --> 10:03.621
Nope.

10:03.621 --> 10:05.023
Was she hot?

10:06.125 --> 10:07.294
She was found dead

10:07.294 --> 10:08.898
on the hood of a wrecked Ferrari

10:08.898 --> 10:11.135
that you bought
about six weeks ago.

10:11.135 --> 10:12.706
Is the car okay?

10:12.706 --> 10:14.108
(Dylan chuckles)

10:14.108 --> 10:16.747
I think it would be
in your best interest

10:16.747 --> 10:17.849
if we went somewhere

10:17.849 --> 10:20.320
where we could talk
about this very sensitive matter

10:20.320 --> 10:21.724
in private.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.159
All right.
(groaning)

10:23.159 --> 10:24.195
You're under arrest

10:24.195 --> 10:25.263
for possession of narcotics.

10:25.263 --> 10:26.265
Come on.
Let me go!

10:26.265 --> 10:27.769
Damn it!
Get your ass in there.

10:27.769 --> 10:28.738
Are you kidding me?!

10:31.142 --> 10:32.746
RIGGS:
Rachel!

10:37.889 --> 10:39.693
Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

10:39.693 --> 10:40.895
I do.

10:40.895 --> 10:43.434
Detective Riggs,
meet Dylan Ashworth.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.170
Now he does, too.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.174
Hey.
Hmm?

10:47.174 --> 10:48.844
You all right?

10:48.844 --> 10:50.313
I just saw somebody
I knew.

10:50.313 --> 10:52.485
Doesn't seem like this is
your kind of scene.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.255
No, it was a friend
of Miranda's

10:54.255 --> 10:55.925
Her old roommate.

10:55.925 --> 10:57.796
I'll have both
your badges.

10:57.796 --> 10:58.931
BOTH:
Shut up!

10:58.931 --> 10:59.933
Get out of here.

11:09.193 --> 11:11.824
Hi, everyone. Rachel.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.808
Uh, I hate giving speeches,

11:13.808 --> 11:16.948
but there is one story
I'd like to tell.

11:16.948 --> 11:20.088
So Miranda and I
were living together

11:20.088 --> 11:23.628
when she booked a job
in Texas.

11:23.628 --> 11:25.866
And I get a phone call
from her,

11:25.866 --> 11:29.640
and she says that she's
gonna be staying a little longer

11:29.640 --> 11:31.577
'cause she met a guy...
(chuckles)

11:31.577 --> 11:33.515
... and could I send her
some clothes?

11:33.515 --> 11:36.019
I said, "Sure.
What do you need?"

11:36.019 --> 11:37.856
And she said,
"Cowboy boots."

11:37.856 --> 11:40.061
(scattered laughter)

11:40.061 --> 11:44.002
I knew in that moment
that I lost her forever.

11:44.002 --> 11:47.142
Um, Martin, I don't know what
you did or how you did it...

11:47.142 --> 11:48.278
(acoustic music playing)

11:48.278 --> 11:50.782
... but Miranda is happier
than I have ever seen her.

Enjoy the rest

13:02.492 --> 13:03.828
You know, you nearly
gave your dad

13:03.828 --> 13:05.532
another heart attack
yesterday.

13:05.532 --> 13:07.502
Come on, Mom,
it's no big deal.

13:07.502 --> 13:09.773
Riana, you don't want
pictures like that

13:09.773 --> 13:10.942
floating around
the Internet.

13:10.942 --> 13:13.214
It's not like
I was naked.
It's not like you were

13:13.214 --> 13:15.585
shouting "respect me" either.

13:15.585 --> 13:18.191
Sharing your body,
Riana,

13:18.191 --> 13:20.662
even in a picture,
is a big deal.

13:20.662 --> 13:23.801
So what, I should just
wear a turtleneck every day?

13:23.801 --> 13:26.941
I'm not talking
about your clothes, honey.

13:26.941 --> 13:29.079
I'm talking about
your choices.

13:29.079 --> 13:31.684
If you don't respect
your body,

13:31.684 --> 13:33.087
boys won't either.

13:33.087 --> 13:35.692
I'm just asking
for you to be smart

13:35.692 --> 13:37.963
and think beyond this moment.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.837
I think what we're
talking about here

13:41.837 --> 13:44.843
is personal responsibility.

13:44.843 --> 13:46.781
Have you guys talked
about the male gaze?

13:48.117 --> 13:50.255
Can you see my gaze?

13:50.255 --> 13:52.893
Yeah. Yeah, I see it.
Uh‐huh.

13:52.893 --> 13:54.897
Keep it moving.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.602
MURTAUGH:
<i>You're telling me</i>

13:57.602 --> 14:00.075
you never met
Nina Clausen before?

14:00.075 --> 14:02.212
That she'd never attended
one of your house parties?

14:02.212 --> 14:03.281
No clue.

14:03.281 --> 14:06.019
I meet a lot of people
and have a lot of parties.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.558
She was found dead on the hood
of your car, Dylan!

14:08.558 --> 14:11.097
And like I told you,
it was stolen.

14:11.097 --> 14:13.568
When?
Not sure.
I was busy.

14:13.568 --> 14:14.903
Doing what with who?

14:14.903 --> 14:16.240
"Whom." There were
a few of them.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.109
Don't remember
their names.

14:17.109 --> 14:19.113
I'd need to see
pictures of them.

14:19.113 --> 14:20.915
Naked would
make it easier.
(door opens)

14:22.519 --> 14:24.623
Don't say
anything else, Dylan.

14:24.623 --> 14:26.994
Detective Murtaugh, I'm
the Ashworth family's attorney.

14:26.994 --> 14:28.731
This is over right now.

14:28.731 --> 14:30.268
As I understand it,
Detective,

14:30.268 --> 14:31.937
you entered Dylan's house
without a warrant.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.141
I heard a disturbance...

14:33.141 --> 14:34.610
Please, Detective,

14:34.610 --> 14:35.879
excuse my attorney's tone.

14:35.879 --> 14:36.914
From what I understand,

14:36.914 --> 14:39.153
there's enough blame
to go around in this matter,

14:39.153 --> 14:41.290
the lion's share of it
falling squarely on my son.

14:41.290 --> 14:43.628
But in light
of the circumstances,

14:43.628 --> 14:44.830
at this point we view this

14:44.830 --> 14:46.767
as a family matter.
Captain...

14:46.767 --> 14:48.638
I appreciate
your cooperation, Captain.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.577
And you have my apologies
for the confusion.

14:51.577 --> 14:54.650
Is someone confused
about something here?
That's enough, Detective.

14:58.925 --> 15:00.995
What the hell were you
thinking, Roger?

15:00.995 --> 15:02.265
You may have just
jeopardized any case

15:02.265 --> 15:03.935
we try to make
against the kid on this.

15:03.935 --> 15:06.005
That punk pulled out
a vial of coke

15:06.005 --> 15:07.776
<i>after</i> I told him
I was a cop.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.048
That's why you brought
him in, for possession?

15:10.048 --> 15:11.917
You see that girl
in the morgue?

15:11.917 --> 15:13.154
That's why
I brought him in.

15:13.154 --> 15:15.091
Dylan, all his friends
at the party,

15:15.091 --> 15:16.894
they all think that
they're untouchable.

15:16.894 --> 15:19.299
And he'll remain that way
unless you and Riggs can find

15:19.299 --> 15:21.036
some solid evidence.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.205
Where is Riggs, anyway?

15:22.205 --> 15:24.576
He's running down a lead.

15:24.576 --> 15:25.912
He said he wanted
to go alone.

15:25.912 --> 15:27.082
God help us.

15:31.123 --> 15:34.096
Martin?
Is that you?

15:34.096 --> 15:36.333
Oh, my God, it is you.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.969
Hi.
Hey, Rachel, yeah.

15:37.969 --> 15:40.341
Good to see you.
How are you?

15:40.341 --> 15:41.944
It's been a while.

15:41.944 --> 15:44.683
Well, since yesterday
at the party.

15:44.683 --> 15:46.687
Party? What are you
talking about?

15:46.687 --> 15:48.691
Come on, Rach.

15:48.691 --> 15:50.962
Yesterday,
Dylan Ashworth's house.

15:50.962 --> 15:53.401
I saw you,
you saw me.

15:53.401 --> 15:55.638
No, sorry, you must
be confused.

15:55.638 --> 15:57.309
Here's the deal, Rach.

15:57.309 --> 15:59.313
I'm investigating a homicide.

15:59.313 --> 16:01.317
19‐year‐old Nina Clausen.

16:01.317 --> 16:03.220
I think Ashworth's involved.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.837
Maybe we should
talk inside.

16:20.822 --> 16:22.759
(Riggs clears throat quietly)

16:29.706 --> 16:32.912
So... So why'd you
run away from me yesterday?

16:32.912 --> 16:36.720
(sighs)
I don't know.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.194
I just... that party...
those people.

16:40.194 --> 16:43.134
I didn't want you to think
I was a part of that scene.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.136
Why were you there?

16:44.136 --> 16:47.308
I was invited by the guy
who hosted the party.

16:47.308 --> 16:50.181
Julian?
Yeah.

16:58.164 --> 16:59.766
How are you, Martin?

16:59.766 --> 17:03.107
Oh, hanging in there.
Good.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.778
I assumed you'd be
back in Texas.

17:05.778 --> 17:07.649
Oh, no,
I couldn't stay there,

17:07.649 --> 17:08.784
so, you know,
I came out here,

17:08.784 --> 17:09.986
got a little place
down at the beach.

17:09.986 --> 17:12.192
Down by the cove?

17:15.765 --> 17:17.869
So look, if I, uh...
if I wanted to find

17:17.869 --> 17:20.174
this Julian guy,
where would I look?

17:20.174 --> 17:23.012
I heard he hangs out
at the Amal Hotel.

17:24.416 --> 17:25.918
Okay. Thanks a lot.

17:25.918 --> 17:29.024
Hey... we should

17:29.024 --> 17:32.632
get together sometime,
catch up.

17:33.934 --> 17:35.771
Sure.

17:35.771 --> 17:39.179
Look, um, stay away
from Julian...

17:39.179 --> 17:40.481
and Ashworth.

17:40.481 --> 17:42.719
Okay?

17:49.466 --> 17:52.238
♪ ♪

17:56.947 --> 17:59.486

people to the truth...

17:59.486 --> 18:00.555
JULIAN:
The truth...

18:00.555 --> 18:04.763
The truth of what they want.
What they really want.

18:04.763 --> 18:06.900
What they think
they can't have.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.771
The forbidden fruit.

18:08.771 --> 18:11.176
But forbidden by whom?

18:11.176 --> 18:14.783
Pleasure, pain,
adrenaline, anything.

18:14.783 --> 18:18.057
You tell me, and
I will get it for you.

18:18.057 --> 18:22.098
Oh, feel rest assured
should any complications arise,

18:22.098 --> 18:24.202
I will make them go away.

18:27.475 --> 18:29.011
JULIAN:
Excuse me.

18:34.889 --> 18:36.159
When you're ready.

18:37.829 --> 18:40.368
Man, just hearing
his sales pitch

18:40.368 --> 18:42.305
makes me want
to take a shower.

18:42.305 --> 18:43.841
Makes me want to do something.

18:43.841 --> 18:47.048
I think he's connecting
with someone right now.

18:47.048 --> 18:48.050
All right, give me the keys,
I'm gonna follow him.

18:48.050 --> 18:49.018
You go with the girl.

18:49.018 --> 18:50.554
Look, if you find
anything to charge him with,

18:50.554 --> 18:52.125
call me.
Not a scratch, Riggs.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.195
Yeah, just‐‐
Yeah.

18:54.195 --> 18:55.131
Sir?

18:57.902 --> 18:59.939
$14 for a club soda?

18:59.939 --> 19:01.476
You guys smoking crack?

19:01.476 --> 19:05.084
I should have bought
the crack, it's cheaper.

19:05.084 --> 19:07.755

19:25.391 --> 19:29.065

19:29.065 --> 19:30.434
Uh, Detective.

You know, I haven't
written a traffic summons

19:32.405 --> 19:34.142
in I don't know
how long.

19:34.142 --> 19:37.013
But when I noticed
that you had...

19:37.013 --> 19:38.884
a broken side mirror,

19:38.884 --> 19:39.886
I just couldn't help myself,

19:39.886 --> 19:41.056
right, because broken mirrors

19:41.056 --> 19:42.291
just drive me crazy.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.162
Well, a more accurate assessment
would be "drive me crazier."

19:44.162 --> 19:45.297
So why don't you...

19:45.297 --> 19:47.034
why don't you get out
of the car?

19:47.034 --> 19:48.170
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

19:50.107 --> 19:52.812
There we are.
There we are.

20:00.327 --> 20:02.965
(whipping, moaning)

20:05.204 --> 20:08.544
Oh... what is that?

20:08.544 --> 20:10.281
That's private.
No, no, no.

20:10.281 --> 20:13.420
California statute 1249...

20:13.420 --> 20:15.624
or better known as
the "five‐second rule."

20:15.624 --> 20:16.960
Once something falls
on the ground,

20:16.960 --> 20:18.363
it becomes public knowledge.

20:18.363 --> 20:20.100
What do we got here?

20:20.100 --> 20:24.242
Names and addresses
and phone numbers, oh, my.

20:24.242 --> 20:26.513
(whipping)
Police! Freeze!

20:26.513 --> 20:28.116
Drop it.

20:28.116 --> 20:30.321
You're under arrest
for solicitation.

20:30.321 --> 20:33.126
We're not having sex,
this is a flogging session.

20:33.126 --> 20:34.128
A what?

20:34.128 --> 20:35.698
One I pay good money for.

20:35.698 --> 20:38.203
He's gonna do my nails
afterwards.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.539
And I haven't got all day,

20:39.539 --> 20:42.010
so one of you better
pick up that whip.

20:46.953 --> 20:48.022
Pick up the whip.

20:50.561 --> 20:53.166
(cell phone ringing)

20:53.166 --> 20:54.569
Oh, hey, Rog.

20:54.569 --> 20:56.239
I'm here with
our good buddy Julian.

20:56.239 --> 20:58.710
He's a real dick,
but he smells incredible.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.383
Yeah? Well, cut him loose.
We have nothing.

21:03.987 --> 21:07.128
You know the truth
I wanna be connected with?

21:10.067 --> 21:12.672
Who killed Nina Clausen?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.442
I don't know who
that is, Detective.

21:19.686 --> 21:22.425
I'd get that
side mirror fixed,

21:22.425 --> 21:24.429
because I promise you
you do not want me

21:24.429 --> 21:26.199
pulling you over again.
Hmm.

21:36.626 --> 21:37.818
Murtaugh.
Hmm?

21:37.818 --> 21:39.053
I got that
information for you.

21:39.053 --> 21:40.924
The number on your
daughter's boyfriend.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.261
Belongs to
a Chauncey Perkins,

21:43.261 --> 21:44.798
a surfing instructor

21:44.798 --> 21:46.802

of C‐Dawg.

21:46.802 --> 21:48.205

21:50.008 --> 21:52.814

for pickpocketing.

21:52.814 --> 21:54.350
He's got a <i>record?</i>

21:54.350 --> 21:56.889
Is there anything else?
Yes.

21:56.889 --> 21:58.492
I'm gonna need you
to do your best

21:58.492 --> 22:00.129

27:50.119 --> 27:51.256

you had something to show me.

28:00.039 --> 28:01.041

28:01.041 --> 28:02.645

28:02.645 --> 28:04.649

Nina Clausen's feet.

28:04.649 --> 28:05.517

28:08.924 --> 28:10.794

28:10.794 --> 28:12.831
No. Very rare.

28:12.831 --> 28:14.201

28:14.201 --> 28:16.205

found with similar sap.

28:16.205 --> 28:18.944

28:32.571 --> 28:35.109

genius is rarely understood

28:35.109 --> 28:36.279

28:36.279 --> 28:38.516
(elevator bell dings)

28:38.516 --> 28:41.756
Damn, so there's
four victims?
Yeah.

28:41.756 --> 28:44.027
Okay, get me whatever you can
on each one of the cases.

28:44.027 --> 28:44.996
I got you.

28:46.933 --> 28:47.801
Oh, my God.

28:47.801 --> 28:49.271
Hey, baby!
What brings you to the office?

28:49.271 --> 28:51.275
Chauncey Perkins.

28:51.275 --> 28:52.745
Please tell me you didn't...

28:52.745 --> 28:54.281
It wasn't my idea,
it was Riggs' idea.

28:54.281 --> 28:55.617
I just wanted to scare him,

28:55.617 --> 28:57.020
just rough him up a...

28:57.020 --> 28:58.289
Rough him up? He's 19, Roger!

28:58.289 --> 29:00.293
MURTAUGH:
Exactly! Technically,

29:00.293 --> 29:01.295
he's an adult.

29:01.295 --> 29:02.231
A 19‐year‐old

29:02.231 --> 29:04.702
who you threatened
into committing a crime!

29:04.702 --> 29:06.639
MURTAUGH:
It was a misdemeanor,

29:06.639 --> 29:07.541
not a felony.

29:07.541 --> 29:10.847
Do you know he goes
by the name of C‐Dawg?

29:10.847 --> 29:11.849
His parents called me.

29:11.849 --> 29:13.186
(scoffs):
Snitch.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.855
And he broke up with Ri.

29:14.855 --> 29:16.859
And mind you, she is
less upset about him

29:16.859 --> 29:18.730
than she is ashamed
of her father.

29:18.730 --> 29:20.132
But he really broke up with her?

29:20.132 --> 29:22.136
Roger...
Do you know

29:22.136 --> 29:24.742
that he posted her picture‐‐
<i>the</i> picture‐‐

29:24.742 --> 29:26.746
on his Facebook page?

29:26.746 --> 29:28.883
He did?
Uh‐huh. And when

29:28.883 --> 29:30.754
I told him I'm Riana's dad,

29:30.754 --> 29:33.827
he said, "Which Riana?"

29:33.827 --> 29:35.297
Followed by,

29:35.297 --> 29:38.168
"I got a few."
As <i>if</i>

29:38.168 --> 29:41.642
he's got a whole posse
of girls named...

29:41.642 --> 29:42.644
Okay, listen.

29:42.644 --> 29:44.114
I get it.

29:44.114 --> 29:46.185
I'm gonna have a little chat
with C‐Dawg.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.788
Don't wait up for me.

29:47.788 --> 29:50.059
It's okay, Trish,
I already handled it.

29:50.059 --> 29:51.796
"I got a few."
That's what he said?

29:51.796 --> 29:52.865
Yeah.

29:52.865 --> 29:54.134
Hell to the no!

29:54.134 --> 29:55.604
Hey Trish, don't go do nothing

29:55.604 --> 29:57.674
that I have to arrest you for.

29:57.674 --> 29:59.144
Not that I would ever
arrest you.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.749
You go ahead and
commit crime

30:01.749 --> 30:02.818
at will, baby.

30:06.959 --> 30:09.832
Bailey, what are you working on?

30:09.832 --> 30:11.836
A lead on the Clausen case.

30:11.836 --> 30:13.706
The names in this book are
all in code.

30:13.706 --> 30:15.977
Like "Madison" for a girl
from Wisconsin.

30:15.977 --> 30:18.115
Dylan Ashworth‐‐
"Enzo," for his cars.

30:18.115 --> 30:19.385
So Dylan Ashworth
is in there?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.255
Can you link him
to Nina Clausen?

30:21.255 --> 30:23.393
No. He was with
another girl that night.

30:23.393 --> 30:25.797
But I do think Nina is in here.

30:25.797 --> 30:27.267
This girl's last entry
in the book

30:27.267 --> 30:28.736
was the night of Nina's murder.

30:28.736 --> 30:29.939
Name is Charlotte.

30:29.939 --> 30:31.275
Wasn't Nina
from North Carolina?

30:31.275 --> 30:32.811
Yeah, but the codename
of the guy that she was with

30:32.811 --> 30:33.680
is "Montana."

30:33.680 --> 30:35.417
Okay, so "Montana."
So, he's from

30:35.417 --> 30:36.819
Billings, Bozeman...

30:36.819 --> 30:38.890
Or it could be anywhere else.
Big Sky,

30:38.890 --> 30:40.760
Yellowstone...
Hannah?

30:40.760 --> 30:43.031
Hannah Montana. Joking.

30:43.031 --> 30:44.902
Or Joe Montana.

30:44.902 --> 30:45.971
The quarterback?

30:45.971 --> 30:49.043
I know who Joe Montana is.
He played for the 49ers.

30:51.181 --> 30:53.853
Named for the Gold Rush.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.924
The Ashworths were
the original 49ers.

30:55.924 --> 30:57.261
But Nina wasn't with Dylan
that night.

30:57.261 --> 30:58.263
So what if Montana

30:58.263 --> 31:00.200
is another Ashworth?

31:00.200 --> 31:02.271
The father, Henry?

31:02.271 --> 31:03.273
It's possible.

31:03.273 --> 31:05.009
Julian could have supplied him
with the girls

31:05.009 --> 31:07.314
and he would have access
to his son's Ferrari.

31:07.314 --> 31:08.416
SCORSESE:
As well as his own

31:08.416 --> 31:09.685
oil fields.

31:09.685 --> 31:10.887
Captain. Bailey.

31:10.887 --> 31:12.457
In an effort to impress
that will,

31:12.457 --> 31:14.027
no doubt, go unnoticed,

31:14.027 --> 31:15.230
I looked into the
other dead women.

31:15.230 --> 31:16.766
One body was

31:16.766 --> 31:19.170
on land owned
by an Ashworth oil subsidiary.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.005
And this...

31:20.005 --> 31:22.444
is the Ashworth estate
in Bel‐Air.

31:22.444 --> 31:23.780
Note the front of the house.

31:23.780 --> 31:25.317
Specifically, the trees.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.189
Red Dawn Full Moon
Japanese Maples.

31:28.189 --> 31:29.224
What does that mean?

31:29.224 --> 31:31.195
It means Henry Ashworth
is probably
