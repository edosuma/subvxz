01:46.397 --> 01:48.650
Jiwoo. Did you hear from your dad?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.781
Yoon Jiwoo. You didn't hear from your dad?

01:55.365 --> 01:58.118
You brat. You should answer
when an adult asks you something.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.453
When are you done today?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.831
Answer if your dad calls,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.416
and call me if he does.

02:15.552 --> 02:19.013
Hey! If your dad calls,
tell him to turn himself in!

02:19.681 --> 02:20.598
Okay?

02:23.059 --> 02:25.019
That rude brat doesn't answer after all.

02:28.439 --> 02:32.861
YOON JIWOO, JUNKIE, IDIOT
GET LOST, DRUGGIE, PSYCHO BITCH

02:45.206 --> 02:47.709
She's actually back.

02:47.792 --> 02:52.088
I can't believe this.
What an honor roll student.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.840
Hey, junkie. Why are you still here?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.550
-Leave her alone.
-Transfer already, geez.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.552
Don't. Her dad's going to come after you.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.804
Bullshit. There are cops everywhere.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.807
Your junkie dad
probably kicked the bucket somewhere.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.858
I did well that time.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.192
Whatever.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.193
Hurry up.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.236
Let's try again.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.113
-Run for it!
-My bad!

03:17.822 --> 03:19.449
Watch out!

03:19.532 --> 03:20.742
My ball!

03:20.825 --> 03:22.702
Dammit, she's fucking annoying.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.456
What? What, fucker?

03:26.539 --> 03:28.958
-What? You got a problem with me?
-Hey.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.252
-She's so annoying, damn junkie.
-Let it go.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.809
The school decided to transfer you.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.270
I'll prepare the necessary forms, so--

03:49.354 --> 03:50.939
Why am I being transferred?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.109
Do you want to stay here and keep
making people uncomfortable?

03:56.861 --> 03:59.572
Do you know how many calls
I get from disgruntled parents?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.537
Have you still not heard from your dad?

04:08.122 --> 04:12.502
HAPPY 17TH BIRTHDAY
YOON DONGHOON SENT YOU A CAKE

04:16.464 --> 04:18.007
Hey. Give me that.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.843
What? Get lost.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.846
-Aw, are you sad?
-Are you sad?

04:24.764 --> 04:26.099
Loser.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.267
-So cute.
-What a loser.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.769
-Hey, she's here.
-Give me my phone.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.440
Hey. It's drugs.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.025
Call the cops. I'm so scared.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.821
How could you bring drugs to school?

04:46.244 --> 04:47.328
What?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.746
What, fucker?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.165
-What's she doing?
-What the…

04:51.249 --> 04:53.126
Did she lose her mind?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.419
Shit.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.920
Are you insane?

04:56.504 --> 04:58.089
Are you fucking crazy?

04:59.090 --> 04:59.966
You fucking…

05:07.015 --> 05:08.516
You crazy bitch.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.185
Hey, you bitch.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.859
Hey, junkie!

05:23.072 --> 05:24.365
Have you lost it?.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.827
Hey.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.171
What's gotten into her?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.064
Are you insane?

06:00.568 --> 06:02.820
A gangster's daughter
should do this much. Fuck.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.330
Yoon Jiwoo!

06:15.750 --> 06:17.502
SHIN YOUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
YOON JIWOO

06:17.585 --> 06:18.795
I'll drop out.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.719
SHIN YOUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

06:29.180 --> 06:31.265
Kim Geonyeong, that punk…

06:32.350 --> 06:34.977
-Oh my gosh.
-What the… That…

06:35.061 --> 06:36.395
-Hey.
-Damn, seriously.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.357
-You brat!
-Hey. What's your problem?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.235
-Jiwoo. Hey! Stop right there!
-Damn it.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.653
Hey, you brat!

06:45.029 --> 06:46.072
Hey!

06:46.155 --> 06:48.074
Jiwoo! Damn it…

06:50.660 --> 06:53.371
You're dead if I catch you.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.498
Why you little…

06:56.624 --> 06:57.708
Where are you going?

07:00.169 --> 07:01.045
Hey!

07:01.587 --> 07:02.797
Jiwoo!

07:33.161 --> 07:35.872
PHOTOS

08:01.898 --> 08:04.025
Jiwoo, did you meet your dad?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.444
-Yes?
-He's asking you a question.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.988
-You brat. Hey!
-Come on.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.323
-Are you a thug?
-Just let it slide.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.859
<i>The caller is unavailable.
Please leave a message…</i>

09:23.771 --> 09:25.606
<i>Jiwoo, it's Dad.</i>

09:27.316 --> 09:29.569
<i>Why haven't you been picking up?</i>

09:30.069 --> 09:33.781
Happy birthday, my dear daughter.

09:35.783 --> 09:39.036
Sorry I couldn't
cook you a birthday meal. Gosh.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.039
<i>Did you get the gift I sent?</i>

09:42.123 --> 09:44.041
<i>The iPad. Did you get it?</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:46.043
<i>It's expensive.</i>

09:48.170 --> 09:49.088
<i>Hello?</i>

09:50.339 --> 09:52.216
<i>What did you do today?</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:55.469
<i>I bet you went singing
with your friends again.</i>

09:58.431 --> 09:59.765
Jiwoo.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.434
<i>Hello?</i>

10:01.517 --> 10:04.604
Cops who are after you
have been following me for a month.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.066
Rumors spread I'm a gangster's daughter,
so no one talks to me at school.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.153
WANTED FUGITIVES

10:13.988 --> 10:14.947
What…

10:17.158 --> 10:19.035
What are you talking about?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.119
You're…

10:21.412 --> 10:23.706
<i>You should have told me.</i>

10:23.789 --> 10:27.835
How could I? Your phone's off.
I don't know where you are or anything!

10:28.544 --> 10:30.254
<i>What is it this time?</i>

10:30.338 --> 10:32.423
Why do you do this to me?

10:33.382 --> 10:35.509
It's not like that.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.054
Jiwoo.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.559
<i>I'm going to settle everything
and go back soon.</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:48.189
So just wait a little longer.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.569
I won't wait for you anymore.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.699
I'll consider you dead,
so don't come back.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.735
Sir. You can't use the phone.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.413
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH
BECAUSE OF YOU?

11:45.496 --> 11:48.040
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME?
AM I NOT YOUR DAUGHTER?

11:48.124 --> 11:51.377
THE COPS ARE STILL OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS

11:51.460 --> 11:53.212
DAD, WHERE ARE YOU? PLEASE CALL ME

11:58.509 --> 12:00.553
-Taeju.
-Yes?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.058
Get out.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.861
Here. Here you go.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.488
Gosh.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.823
Cut back on your smoking.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.284
I'm about to burst. Geez.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.998
Shit. You asshole.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.692
Jiwoo. It's Dad.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.062
Dad?

14:38.794 --> 14:39.920
Dad.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.422
Dad. Are you okay?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.716
-What is it?
-Please…

14:44.466 --> 14:45.676
Not my daughter.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.931
Dad!

14:57.855 --> 14:58.772
Dad!

15:00.024 --> 15:01.442
Open the door!

15:01.525 --> 15:03.569
Don't come out!

15:03.652 --> 15:04.612
Jiwoo, don't come out!

15:18.334 --> 15:20.794
Dad, are you okay? Open the door.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.422
Please, I want to come out.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.301
Please let me out. Please.

15:29.053 --> 15:29.887
Jiwoo.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.764
Yes?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.224
I'm sorry

15:35.684 --> 15:37.478
I made your life so hard.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.856
No! No, it's okay!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.609
It's okay! Open the door.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.486
Please, Dad.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.364
How did it end up like this?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.700
It's all my fault.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.118
No.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.496
No, it isn't, Dad.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.914
It's not.

15:56.997 --> 15:57.957
Jiwoo.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.043
-Yes, Dad.
-My dear Jiwoo.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.880
To me…

16:07.925 --> 16:08.884
you were…

16:24.525 --> 16:26.235
Hold on.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.780
Hold on, Dad. No.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.281
No!

16:36.662 --> 16:39.331
Dad! No, Dad! Dad!

16:41.583 --> 16:44.169
Dad…

16:47.715 --> 16:49.133
No!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.309
Dad.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.895
Dad. Wake up.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.981
Wake up, Dad! What's wrong?

17:05.065 --> 17:09.486
Dad. Please, Dad.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.031
Help us!

17:12.114 --> 17:14.283
Somebody, please help my dad!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.701
Please. Help my dad…

18:42.121 --> 18:44.123
Are you the drug ring boss?

18:48.168 --> 18:50.045
What did you make my dad do?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.217
Did you make him…

18:58.971 --> 19:01.140
beat people up, threaten them,
and stab them?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.315
Who killed my dad?

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
Your father…

19:17.239 --> 19:19.741
was my most trusted friend and brother.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.246
And Donghoon was…

19:27.708 --> 19:29.126
a good father.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.257
Just remember that.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.686
Come closer.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.190
Please, come closer.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.526
It'll be the last time you see him,

19:54.610 --> 19:58.280
so say goodbye
and wish him a peaceful afterlife.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.616
Hold his hand and send him off.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.855
<i>What a nice song.</i>

20:32.522 --> 20:34.024
What's it called?

20:34.107 --> 20:35.609
Why is your hand so banged up?

20:37.694 --> 20:39.488
Maybe because I get scared too easily.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.493
Dad.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.994
-Come on.
-Why not?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.496
Stop filming.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.539
Okay, Dad.

20:50.958 --> 20:51.792
Yes?

20:52.417 --> 20:56.255
If you could turn back time…

20:56.797 --> 20:58.382
So, if you could…

20:58.465 --> 21:00.175
-Turn back time?
-Yes.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.761
If you could go back to when you were 17…

21:06.390 --> 21:07.808
would you want to go back?

21:12.938 --> 21:13.855
No.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.651
Because then

21:18.610 --> 21:20.070
I couldn't be your dad.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.780
Whatever.

21:23.824 --> 21:24.658
Jiwoo.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.078
Should we build a house by the sea
and live there?

21:28.578 --> 21:29.621
Let's live in Jeju.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.123
No.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.625
We can build a house on the beach,

21:33.709 --> 21:36.336
hang a hammock in the yard,
and get a dog too.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.546
Sounds great!

21:37.629 --> 21:39.256
Let's do that.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.342
When? When are we going?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.260
Soon.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.972
I'm almost done with my job.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.354
This is nice.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.012
-What is it now?
-What are you doing?

22:28.263 --> 22:29.473
Why did you drop the case?

22:29.556 --> 22:32.350
There's no murder weapon or a witness.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.394
We have no leads.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.896
So that's it?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.319
What about this asshole?

22:42.402 --> 22:44.237
You have to catch this son of a bitch!

22:44.821 --> 22:46.490
Hey. How can we catch him with this?

22:46.573 --> 22:48.200
You go and catch him then.

22:48.283 --> 22:51.078
Fuck! A person has died!

22:52.537 --> 22:53.663
It's okay.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.626
What did you say to your dad?

22:58.502 --> 23:00.170
You were the last to speak to him.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.134
Yoon Donghoon was
on the national wanted list

23:06.218 --> 23:08.470
and had been in hiding for three months.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.306
What did you say
to make him run right over?

23:13.683 --> 23:15.560
I won't wait for you anymore.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.482
I'll consider you dead,
so don't come back.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.028
You should have told him
to turn himself in.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.114
Then he wouldn't have died like that.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.283
-What the fuck is your problem?
-Hey!

23:30.367 --> 23:31.660
-Keep it down.
-Come on!

23:31.743 --> 23:33.829
You assholes!

23:33.912 --> 23:35.580
-God damn assholes!
-Get off!

23:35.664 --> 23:38.458
Let go of me! Fuck!

23:49.052 --> 23:50.846
You might want to look at this.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.523
SECURITY FOOTAGE INVESTIGATION

25:26.358 --> 25:28.360
This is my dad's killer. Please find him.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.949
You said he was
your most trusted friend and brother.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.534
If I find him?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.579
I'll kill him myself.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.087
You'll kill him yourself…

25:56.930 --> 25:58.932
Do you know what it is to kill someone?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.282
Stab me.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.163
Think of me as the killer and stab me.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.751
Stab me.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.629
Stab me.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.507
Stab me!

26:54.029 --> 26:55.113
Get her out of here.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.313
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

30:13.853 --> 30:15.605
Want some drugs? Hey.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.357
Let's hang out.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.084
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES
REWARD: 5 MILLION WON

30:56.563 --> 30:58.690
Goodness. You always
buy so many cigarettes.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.608
Thank you so much.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.659
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES
REWARD: 5 MILLION WON

31:29.137 --> 31:32.265
UNKNOWN NUMBER

31:34.475 --> 31:36.269
<i>I know this asshole.</i>

31:36.352 --> 31:37.562
<i>Bring the money.</i>

31:37.645 --> 31:39.314
<i>I'll text you the location.</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:26.361
Hey!

32:28.988 --> 32:30.365
You're right on time.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.574
Who is he?

32:31.658 --> 32:34.410
I'll tell you if you show me the money.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.120
You need to pay us first.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.635
Tell me who he is.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.519
That asshole's initials are G.R.

33:00.853 --> 33:04.357
Grim Reaper.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.694
He's the grim reaper here to kill you.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.533
-It's really 5 million.
-Shit.

33:13.616 --> 33:17.537
Hey. We kill people for even 1 million.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.124
For 5 million, we'll even
preserve the body parts if you want.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.376
So? Which parts do you want?

33:23.459 --> 33:25.920
-We'll send them to you via parcel.
-Geez, damn.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.922
You're not going anywhere!

33:31.759 --> 33:33.136
Fucking kill him!

33:34.345 --> 33:35.847
-Step aside.
-Fucking asshole.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.689
Fuck, it's a girl.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.817
Hey. She's fucking hot.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.986
-Come here.
-Hey.

33:50.069 --> 33:50.945
Hey.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.656
Shit!

33:57.201 --> 33:58.661
Kill her! Damn it!

34:01.956 --> 34:04.250
-Bitch!
-Wait. Hey!

34:04.834 --> 34:06.044
Don't kick her face.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.296
Damn it!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.200
Hey!

34:39.952 --> 34:42.163
Don't you know how to drive?

34:42.246 --> 34:43.331
-Hey.
-Shit.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.041
Hey, pretend you're hurt.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.710
That fucking bastard.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.464
Hey.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.175
You can't drive for shit.
Are you asking for a fight?

34:54.258 --> 34:55.134
Fuck!

34:56.844 --> 34:58.304
What the hell?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.683
What are you doing, dumbass?

35:03.810 --> 35:04.685
Shit!

35:18.825 --> 35:19.742
Let go!

36:03.327 --> 36:06.330
If you want to die, there are better ways.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.921
It's none of your business.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.057
Did you catch my dad's killer?

36:29.478 --> 36:30.438
I guess not.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.191
Stop acting out and stay low

36:33.900 --> 36:35.651
unless you want to die on the streets.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.531
How can I stay still?

36:42.909 --> 36:45.912
The cops won't investigate,
and you won't do anything!

36:46.996 --> 36:48.080
So how…

36:50.374 --> 36:52.752
How can I live like nothing's happened…

37:00.218 --> 37:02.220
when my dad died because of me?

37:13.481 --> 37:15.441
Must you get revenge?

37:17.693 --> 37:19.487
Regardless of the price?

37:26.994 --> 37:28.663
That's for me to deal with.

37:37.004 --> 37:40.091
If you're really determined
to find and kill him…

37:43.594 --> 37:46.097
you must be someone
capable of killing others.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.472
SEONJIN SHIPPING

38:45.197 --> 38:46.115
Hello, sir.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.283
Hello, sir.

38:53.539 --> 38:54.540
Hello, sir.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.336
Hello, sir.

39:01.756 --> 39:02.923
She's a new recruit.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.134
Introduce yourself.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.274
What the hell is she?

39:22.485 --> 39:24.111
Maybe she's a snack?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.821
For us to feed on when we're bored?

39:26.572 --> 39:27.990
Hey. She's just a kid.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.202
Exactly. So we'll raise her well,
then eat her.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.372
He said she's a member, not a snack.

39:36.248 --> 39:37.750
Whatever, asshole.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.128
-Gosh.
-He must like her. Crazy bastard.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.380
Hey, kid.

39:44.965 --> 39:45.966
Come with me.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.235
What do you

40:05.236 --> 40:06.821
plan to do with her?

40:09.698 --> 40:11.075
She wants to get revenge.

40:15.996 --> 40:16.997
Let her.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.924
You can sleep here.

40:34.515 --> 40:37.476
From now on, cleaning, laundry,
and the dishes

40:37.560 --> 40:38.853
are your duties.

40:40.396 --> 40:41.897
I get to move up now.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.567
I was the youngest until now.

40:45.776 --> 40:46.819
For two whole years.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.910
Once you prove yourself,
you can move there.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.164
You become a real member
of the organization.

40:59.748 --> 41:02.877
I'm going to make it to the top
when I get there.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.761
Why did you come here?

41:14.013 --> 41:14.847
A girl.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.016
To get stronger.

41:23.355 --> 41:24.190
Sure.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.193
I bid you luck.

41:44.502 --> 41:48.255
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

41:51.926 --> 41:53.177
Don't worry.

41:58.557 --> 41:59.767
I can handle it.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.969
Hey, newbie!

42:37.179 --> 42:38.138
Hey!

42:39.390 --> 42:43.018
<i>Oh, you're sexy</i>

42:43.102 --> 42:44.853
<i>Sexy, sexy, sexy!</i>

42:44.937 --> 42:45.896
All together!

42:45.980 --> 42:47.856
<i>Sexy, sexy, sexy!</i>

42:48.774 --> 42:51.610
<i>Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy!</i>

42:52.987 --> 42:55.406
What are you glaring at, fucking bitch?

42:56.782 --> 42:58.492
Give me a piece of that ass.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.161
Me too!

43:01.245 --> 43:03.247
Hey. You're the prettiest one here.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.792
You're absolutely the fucking prettiest!

43:06.875 --> 43:09.461
-A man is declaring his love and--
-Damn it!

43:48.584 --> 43:50.169
She's so fucking annoying.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.089
Are you okay?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.215
Damn it!

43:56.133 --> 43:57.134
How petite.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.889
Look at the fire in her eyes.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.391
Do you want to fight?

44:04.475 --> 44:05.684
Fuck!

44:07.019 --> 44:08.812
You fucking bitch.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.022
Geez.

44:10.939 --> 44:12.524
Give me some ass.

44:14.735 --> 44:15.819
Fucking bitch.

44:15.903 --> 44:17.655
Hey. Stop it.

44:17.738 --> 44:21.033
Why are you here if you're not
going to fuck us, you cunt?

44:21.116 --> 44:23.994
That fucking bitch started it!
Let go of me!

44:24.078 --> 44:24.953
Get off!

45:12.084 --> 45:13.752
Are you thinking of running away?

45:14.920 --> 45:16.422
I'm thinking of winning.

45:20.300 --> 45:21.343
Exactly.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.013
You can't win like that.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.645
It's not "winning"

45:33.814 --> 45:34.898
but "killing."

45:36.942 --> 45:38.193
Kill him.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.990
That's what you should think.

45:44.450 --> 45:46.201
Don't try to use your strength.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.745
No matter how much you train,
they'll be stronger.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.038
Then what do I do?

45:56.795 --> 45:58.130
Attack their vital points.

46:02.009 --> 46:06.513
The temple, upper lip, chin, solar plexus,

46:07.222 --> 46:09.308
and genitals.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.439
Just their vital points.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.318
Then you can incapacitate your opponent.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.034
Let's try it.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.495
What?

46:30.162 --> 46:31.121
Come here.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.493
Upper lip.

47:14.790 --> 47:15.749
Harder!

47:16.375 --> 47:17.251
Chin.

47:18.710 --> 47:19.670
Keep your guard up.

47:37.604 --> 47:38.480
Are you okay?

47:39.648 --> 47:40.983
That one was good.

47:42.484 --> 47:44.611
You've got talent, but not enough power.

47:45.362 --> 47:46.196
Again.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.788
DO NOT ENTER

49:17.871 --> 49:19.873
<i>-We protect the organization!
-We protect the organization!</i>

49:21.041 --> 49:23.627
The organization protects us.

49:23.710 --> 49:26.004
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

50:05.711 --> 50:06.545
Hold on.

50:54.092 --> 50:55.260
Do Gangjae wins!

50:56.261 --> 50:59.973
Your reward is a week's vacation
and a cash prize of 10 million won.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.232
-Do Gangjae!
-Do Gangjae!

51:09.316 --> 51:11.276
I think the rookie's still left.

52:39.573 --> 52:44.578
