l'll be as fast as l can.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.209
Jesus Christ.
l'll never get used to seeing that.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.381
Won't have to
much longer.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.823
Got you scheduled
for surgery tomorrow.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.850
Finally close you up.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.987
- More surgery?
- lt's a good sign.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.463
Dr. Plepler doesn't think
he'll need access anymore.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.969
Watch it with
the morphine, now.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.413
Beautiful thought.
Who put that up?

02:31.451 --> 02:33.351
My sister.
Who else?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.980
Why you keep it up there
if you don't find it inspirational?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.314
My daughter likes it.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.822
Everybody keeps telling me
how lucky l am.

02:42.862 --> 02:46.354
You are. Septic shock?
As long as you were out?

02:46.399 --> 02:48.196
Attending staff
gave you 20 to one.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.702
You read the paper?

02:50.737 --> 02:52.364
My own uncle
puts me through this.

02:55.241 --> 02:58.335
New gunshot.
Rapper. Da Lux.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.711
He's hot. Got shot seven times
coming out of a club.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.475
He's still got
all his pancreas, though.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.050
All done.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.256
Fiona.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.659
Look,
l've been feeling...

03:17.263 --> 03:20.494
l don't know,

03:20.533 --> 03:22.728
not myself,

03:22.769 --> 03:24.566
since l woke up
from the coma.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.841
My thoughts keep
running away with me.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.038
These feelings?
They'll pass.

03:33.079 --> 03:36.071
lt's very common
in post-surgical patients.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.640
Maybe you'd like to talk to someone.
Social worker?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.657
Hey babe, how ya feeling?

03:52.699 --> 03:54.894
Oh, good good.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.367
That candy striper
out there,

03:56.402 --> 03:58.267
there's not much
of a selection.

03:58.304 --> 04:01.762
There was something on ''Sink the
Bismarck,'' but half the pages were gone.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.571
But you like dinosaurs.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.903
Having surgery tomorrow.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.574
They say they're
closing me up.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.501
Gus!

04:32.538 --> 04:35.507
Jason,
my condolences.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.169
Your dad was the best boss
any of us ever had.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.645
We're sad to hear
you're selling the company.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.170
l've been going
over the books.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.376
We're paying
an Anthony Soprano

04:44.417 --> 04:46.908
the second-highest salary
in the company.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.580
He's a consultant.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.589
Where do l reach him?

04:50.623 --> 04:53.592
l want to make some changes,
but his office is full of junk.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.992
There's a 55-horse
Johnson outboard on the desk.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.997
Looks like nobody's
ever there.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.397
He's in the hospital.

05:00.433 --> 05:04.301
You should talk
to his colleague, Mr. Gaultieri.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.805
Paulie?

05:06.839 --> 05:09.899
Oh, Tony Soprano.
Of course.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.672
l knew him when l was a kid.
He was a friend of the family.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.405
l'm having surgery tomorrow.
l'm not supposed to eat!

05:18.418 --> 05:21.012
You fucking
believe this?

05:21.054 --> 05:22.919
Always something.

05:22.955 --> 05:25.924
So anyway, she was crying
the entire night

05:25.958 --> 05:28.119
and l didn't get
any sleep.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.153
Why don't you ride on the fucking
zephyrs and sleep on a cloud?

05:31.197 --> 05:34.030
What, you think
l put that up there?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.160
- l didn't.
- Right.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.432
Who then?

05:41.574 --> 05:44.304
Hello.
l can't hear--

05:44.344 --> 05:47.780
Yeah-- talk louder!

05:47.814 --> 05:49.748
Nanny.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.307
Between the reception
and her language skills...

06:02.995 --> 06:06.089
l suppose you got a little
choo-choo train at home, huh?

06:06.132 --> 06:08.828
Takes your toast right from the kitchen,
delivers it to your bedroom?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.132
Look, Ton'-- l'm sorry
about what happened

06:11.170 --> 06:14.333
with Junior
and the shooting, but--

06:14.374 --> 06:16.774
Don't mention Junior
to me ever again.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.142
l'll tell you this, Bobby--

06:20.179 --> 06:22.443
You can't hide behind
this brother-in-law shit forever.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.280
You're an okay guy,
but each and every man

06:25.318 --> 06:27.343
is judged
on his own merit.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.664
- Have you heard the good news?
- Jesus Christ!

06:41.701 --> 06:43.669
That's right.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.728
Aaron Arkaway,
Jan's friend.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.603
Oh yeah, right.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.043
We're protesting
downstairs and...

06:53.079 --> 06:54.944
l saw Jan in the elevator
this morning.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.414
She told me
you were up here.

06:56.449 --> 06:59.350
That's what all
that yelling and singing is?

06:59.385 --> 07:02.013
The druggist from the hospital
pharmacy was fired

07:02.054 --> 07:04.750
for refusing
to fill birth control prescriptions.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.759
We're trying
to get his job back.

07:06.793 --> 07:09.421
Tony, this is our prayer leader,
Bob Brewster.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.397
Hi, Aaron's told me
a lot about you.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.297
l thought we'd come up
and pray with you.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.234
- Bottom feeding, huh?
- lt's where the big fish are.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.573
Son of a fuckin' bitch!

07:26.078 --> 07:28.546
They cut my morphine,

07:28.581 --> 07:32.210
trying to wean me off.

07:32.251 --> 07:36.654
You know, l've seen people delivered
from unbelievable pain...

07:36.689 --> 07:39.385
myself included.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.484
- Oh yeah?
- l was at rock bottom.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.927
l was addicted
to cocaine and strippers.

07:43.963 --> 07:47.660
Then l lost my wife
and l crashed my car, drunk.

07:47.700 --> 07:52.296
Ended up upside down, hanging
by my seat belt, completely terrified.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.431
Then l prayed
for God to save me.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.941
- And He came in.
- Praise Him.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.772
And in that moment,
l was reborn.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.278
And l see you there
and l know you're hurting.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.305
And the answer is to accept the Lord
as your personal Savior.

08:05.384 --> 08:08.478
Well l got all this covered, you know,
with my parish priest.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.455
That's great,
but what God wants

08:10.490 --> 08:12.617
is for you
to love Him directly,

08:12.658 --> 08:15.286
not necessarily through
the intercession of liturgy

08:15.328 --> 08:17.956
or any human agent.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.625
ls this
Aaron Arkaway?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.464
- Hey.
- What are you fellas doing here?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.095
- Mrs. Soprano.
- Uh-huh.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.866
We were just dialoguing
with your husband.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.204
We were about to pray.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.006
- They were.
- You're having surgery tomorrow.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.706
You know they've done clinical
studies about the power of prayer.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.308
Prayed-for patients
have 11/% fewer complications.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.616
l have read that.
lt does help to pray.

08:41.654 --> 08:44.350
l mean even if it just
takes your mind off it.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.551
Dear Jesus...

08:46.592 --> 08:49.857
hear these words
and bestow Your loving, healing grace

08:49.896 --> 08:53.263
upon our injured friend.
Lord, help heal his wounds

08:53.299 --> 08:55.733
and help him with
Your cleansing love.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.066
Where sin abounds,

08:58.104 --> 09:00.402
grace abounds even more.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.835
Amen.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.436
- Amen.
- Amen.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.174
Amen.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.454
So, Reverend,
let me, uh--

09:18.491 --> 09:21.255
let me ask you about
this guy not selling birth control.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.888
He should be free
to exercise his moral convictions

09:23.930 --> 09:27.024
without suffering
loss of livelihood.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.233
Well here's
what l'm getting at-- l'm-- l'm...

09:31.270 --> 09:33.932
l'm worried
about Viagra.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.907
The way l see it,
l'm gonna need plenty of that,

09:35.942 --> 09:38.775
considering
my condition and...

09:38.811 --> 09:42.372
what if somebody decides that Viagra
is wrong and God don't like it?

09:42.415 --> 09:46.476
Well, God loves
procreation.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.453
No one's saying
anything against Viagra.

09:48.487 --> 09:51.650
Birth control in the name
of the morning-after pill is a sin

09:51.691 --> 09:54.455
because it strikes
at life, at the unborn.

09:54.493 --> 09:56.620
Yeah but what if somebody
goes after Viagra?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.527
l'm not talking
about procreation

09:58.564 --> 10:00.498
and listen up,
'cause this affects you too.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.660
Something like Viagra
will never be an issue.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.330
Excuse me, but at one time
they were going after booze,

10:05.371 --> 10:08.863
and as a proprietor
of a drinking and eating establishment,

10:08.908 --> 10:10.739
l take this stuff
very seriously.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.710
Strip club,
l believe it is.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.770
- Oh, you've been to the Bing?
- No.

10:14.814 --> 10:17.009
He should rest.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.415
Thank you so much
for coming, Pastor, and Aaron.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.249
Thank you so much
for your prayer.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.688
- Sure.
- Yeah, really l...

10:24.724 --> 10:28.660
- l really appreciate it.
- Bye, guys. Praise God.

10:39.171 --> 10:42.140
- What are you, a wiseass?
- What?

10:42.174 --> 10:43.732
What'd l do?

10:53.586 --> 10:56.316
- Oh my God.
- What is it, Doctor?

10:56.355 --> 10:59.756
l just found Jimmy Hoffa.

10:59.792 --> 11:03.751
ln Montana, the fossilized remains
of a Tyrannosaurus rex

11:03.796 --> 11:06.731
yielded soft tissue that indicated
a definite link

11:06.766 --> 11:09.257
between dinosaurs
and modern birds.

11:09.301 --> 11:14.261
- Look who l got here.
- Ho, the sanitation prince.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.866
Hi, Tony. l'm sorry
you're not feeling well.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.400
Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.606
Your father and l
were very close.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.812
Remember my daughter
Meadow? Jason Barone.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.446
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:29.488 --> 11:31.683
Remember
when you were a kid,

11:31.724 --> 11:35.660
at that field box
at Shea, opening day?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.357
Me, you, your dad
and Paulie here?

11:38.397 --> 11:41.093
Oh yeah. Kingman was
just back from the Cubs.

11:41.133 --> 11:44.261
Mookie Wilson hit that foul tip,
beaned that guy in the loge.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.669
l gotta get to the office.
Finn's picking me up.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.871
- l'll be back later.
- Sweetheart,

11:50.910 --> 11:52.878
thank you
for everything.

11:52.912 --> 11:56.211
Okay.
Don't wear him out.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.680
She wants to be a doctor.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.687
Also considering law.

12:05.524 --> 12:08.960
So, you're living
in Deer Valley?

12:08.994 --> 12:10.291
Yeah, ski instructor.

12:10.329 --> 12:13.787
So, Paulie tells me
you're thinking of selling

12:13.833 --> 12:16.461
your father's business
to Chuckie Cinelli.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.300
Yeah, l think it's
the best thing for Mom.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.136
And of course, Tony, there'd be
a severance package for you.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.742
Frankly, Jason,
l don't think

12:24.777 --> 12:26.745
you should sell
the business right now.

12:26.779 --> 12:30.374
There's a lot
of potential buyers out there.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.907
When l get out of the hospital,
run the numbers,

12:32.952 --> 12:34.715
get you
the best price.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.483
No, Cinelli's offer
seemed fair.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.387
There's lots of things
to take into account.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.892
- You even know what your EBlTDA is?
- My what?

12:40.926 --> 12:45.659
Earnings Before lnterest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.724
Gives the true picture
of a company's profitability.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.971
Jas', you let me
handle this.

12:54.006 --> 12:57.032
l don't want
to see you get hurt.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.340
The carting business--

12:59.378 --> 13:02.313
it's a different
corporate culture.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.010
You're tired, T.
We'll leave. Come on.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.012
All right.
Bye, Tony.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.128
We're afraid
she doesn't have long left.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.001
l'm surprised she
didn't call Ma.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.734
Well she asked specifically
to see you.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.453
Ooh, Madonn'.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.513
Paulie.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.617
Aunt Dottie.
Hold on a sec.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.960
- lt's chilly in here.
- l'm burning up. l'm burning up.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.830
l brought you
some pignolis and...

13:54.867 --> 13:59.395
a new pair of those
Speedo skin-diver socks you like.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.838
Look at those.
The treads are all gone.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.037
You slip on the linoleum again,
then where are we?

14:05.077 --> 14:07.841
- Paulie, l gotta tell you--
- Just a sec.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.577
Sister, please
give me a hand here.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.211
Put these
on my aunt, will ya?

14:14.253 --> 14:16.517
Paulie,
you should know...

14:16.555 --> 14:20.218
- Speak up, Aunt Dot.
- l was...

14:20.259 --> 14:23.456
- l was a bad girl.
- How could you be a bad girl?

14:23.495 --> 14:26.658
- You're a nun.
- These are too small.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.691
No they ain't. They're supposed
to be snug so she don't slip.

14:29.735 --> 14:30.997
- Put 'em on.
- Paulie...

14:31.036 --> 14:33.834
During the war,
l was still a novitiate.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.273
l was helping out
at the USO,

14:36.308 --> 14:40.438
and there was
this soldier-- Russ.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.971
And he was
so lonely--

14:44.016 --> 14:46.007
Aunt Dottie,
if this is going where l think,

14:46.051 --> 14:47.780
maybe you should
talk to a priest.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.811
l got pregnant.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.188
- l had a baby.
- A baby?

14:53.225 --> 14:57.161
Listen to her.
The Alzheimer's is gettin' to her.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.495
You didn't have
no baby.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.126
l did.
l did have a baby.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.626
Paulie...
it was you.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.934
You're my son.

15:10.976 --> 15:14.537
But...

15:14.580 --> 15:16.548
But Ma...?

15:16.582 --> 15:20.541
Marianuccia
is your aunt.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.781
l'm your Ma.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.452
l was a bad girl.

15:31.964 --> 15:35.400
Good afternoon, Mr. Soprano.
How are you doing?

15:36.568 --> 15:38.763
- Better now.
- l'm glad to hear that.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.133
Where they been
keepin' you?

15:43.175 --> 15:44.699
The other doctors
around here--

15:44.743 --> 15:46.608
it's like the United Colors
of Benetton.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.738
l'm not a doctor.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.612
l'm a utilization
review specialist.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.412
l represent
your insurance carrier.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.681
lt's my job, together with
your physicians,

15:54.720 --> 15:58.156
to see how fast we can
get you out of this place and back home.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.751
Well this is good.
They've closed your incision

16:01.794 --> 16:05.389
and you're ambulatory
now and l see they got the Foley out.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.957
You wanna kick
me out of here.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.663
Well, a hospital stay
costs a lot of money.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.571
My bowels don't work.
l'm in pain.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.631
l just got operated on,
for Christ's sake.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.939
Perhaps your bowels
would be working better

16:18.978 --> 16:22.004
if you hadn't tried to eat
the sausage sandwich on 3/28.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.572
l don't believe this. With all the money
l've been contributing

16:24.616 --> 16:28.143
over the years,
you wanna put me in the street.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.452
Look, you think we're the enemy,
but if you hadn't had insurance,

16:31.490 --> 16:32.923
you would have ended up
at the County Hospital.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.823
lt's a good thing that you had your
card with you

16:34.860 --> 16:36.122
when they performed
the wallet biopsy.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.288
- The what?
- ln the ambulance.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.854
lf you hadn't had
your card with you,

16:39.898 --> 16:41.490
they would have dropped your butt
at Martin Luther King.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.728
The ''wallet biopsy''?

16:43.769 --> 16:45.760
Get out of my room,
you sick cunt.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.706
You're doing great.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.243
Mrs. Soprano? Doctor Taschlin's
on the phone for you.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.881
Can you sit here
for a minute, Ton'?

17:04.923 --> 17:07.255
Yeah, l'm winded.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.056
He says he's
downhearted.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.064
l tried to explain
to him

17:13.098 --> 17:14.724
there's an upside
to everything.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.394
Yeah, man.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.561
l know it's
a difficult struggle,

17:18.604 --> 17:20.765
but let's lead with some good news
for a change.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.773
Yeah.
''Armor Gettin''' CD

17:22.808 --> 17:25.140
is now charting
number five, arrow up.

17:25.176 --> 17:28.203
Look, frankly the shooting
couldn't have come at a better time.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.805
Yeah,
but it really hurts.

17:29.848 --> 17:33.682
Sure it does, baby boy.
Sure it does, but check it.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.950
Seven caps!
Tupac ain't get near that.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.650
And 50,
he only got two more.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.453
Yeah, but it really hurts.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.824
lt's helping considerably
with the street cred,

17:42.861 --> 17:45.796
which, as you know, has always
been something of a problem

17:45.831 --> 17:49.164
because you had
a job all those years.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.759
l'm gonna
lose my thumb?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.397
Special hand surgeon
coming in.

17:53.439 --> 17:56.966
Come on, man.
You gonna be all right, Lux.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.001
''Don't put on that face.
lt don't make me weep.

18:00.045 --> 18:03.208
Keep your eyes to yourself,
you sexy freak.''

18:03.248 --> 18:05.079
Nah, l like it better.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.143
''Keep your eyes to yourself, bitch.
l'm on a murder streak.''

18:08.187 --> 18:09.449
Word, word.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.750
Yeah, kinda warn her ass,
you know what l mean?

18:10.789 --> 18:13.553
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You writing a song, huh?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.527
l always wondered
how it was done.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.792
Like this here.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.594
Are you a rap star
my son would know?

18:20.632 --> 18:22.793
Da Lux gonna
produce my album.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.860
Then he gets shot.

18:24.903 --> 18:27.064
Make him gangsta
number one.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.767
lt's like he losing
focus on my shit.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.571
My son says he's
more popular than ever 'cause of it.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.204
What l know is
l ain't gonna have...

18:34.246 --> 18:36.146
no major release
this year.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.115
Man.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.623
Dear...

18:58.370 --> 19:01.771
Paulie,
l won $40 at Keno.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.171
Ow!

19:05.210 --> 19:08.008
ls there something
you wanna tell me about?

19:08.046 --> 19:09.980
What?

19:10.015 --> 19:12.984
l just saw
Aunt Dottie, and guess what?

19:13.018 --> 19:14.883
Turns out
she's not my aunt.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.547
Turns out
she's my mother.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.852
No, that's not true.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.826
Don't bullshit me.
You been bullshitting me my entire life.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.057
- Paulie.
- lt's true, isn't it?

19:25.097 --> 19:27.463
lsn't it?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.593
Son of a bitch!

19:30.636 --> 19:32.627
Oh how l dreaded
this day.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.400
l gave you
everything!

19:34.439 --> 19:36.066
l gave you
a son's love,

19:36.108 --> 19:38.133
all under
false pretenses.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.145
- No.
- You're a fraud,

19:40.179 --> 19:41.612
and a phony.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.137
And she's even worse.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.615
She's a whore.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.311
My mother's
a fuckin' whore!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.444
Don't say that.
She was a young girl.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.749
She wanted
to be a nun,

19:49.788 --> 19:51.153
but she got
in trouble.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.125
And you helped her out,
cooked up this little scheme.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.626
Forget who gets
victimized!

19:55.661 --> 19:59.620
l loved you.
l always loved you.

19:59.665 --> 20:02.293
Paulie!

20:13.145 --> 20:16.672
There he is.
l've been thinking about your problem.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.741
Maybe it would help you
if you got shot.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.686
Fuck you talking 'bout?
''Got shot''?

20:22.721 --> 20:26.282
Make you more popular too,
you know raise your profile with Ex Lax.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.021
Something easy.
The fleshy part of the thigh.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.996
- l'm a marksman.
- You's a crazy motherfucker.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.828
Good morning. Welcome to ''Today''
on a Thursday morning.

20:40.872 --> 20:42.430
- l'm Matt Lauer.
- And l'm Katie Couric.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.135
Poll numbers vary--

20:44.176 --> 20:46.371
...somewhat disappointing
for the administration.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.607
Excuse me. Hi.
You're a friend of Anthony's.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.881
l was just about to visit him.
How's he doing?

20:54.920 --> 20:58.583
He's in a lot better shape than those
fuckin' nuns you got up there.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.761
Put away such memories.

21:03.795 --> 21:07.128
Between father and son,
there is a bridge

21:07.165 --> 21:08.427
which neither time
nor death--

21:08.467 --> 21:11.095
Hey, l got
Phil Leotardo downstairs

21:11.136 --> 21:15.436
This show...
used to watch it all the time

21:15.474 --> 21:17.032
- when l was a little kid.
- What about it?

21:17.075 --> 21:20.841
The bridge of which l speak,
Grasshopper.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.611
- You want me to bring him up?
- No.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.348
Help me out of here.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.089
Hold on.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.192
Easy easy.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.867
Ho! Where the fuck
you going?

21:47.906 --> 21:49.897
Sorry, Ton'.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.040
Hope you got
some sleep last night.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.679
l was snoring
like a son of a bitch.

22:02.721 --> 22:07.181
Oh, l hope you got some sleep.
l was cutting farts like sonic booms.

22:07.225 --> 22:09.193
John Schwinn.

22:09.227 --> 22:10.990
Oh, bicycle heir.

22:11.029 --> 22:13.657
Unfortunately no relation.

22:13.699 --> 22:16.361
l was just a foot soldier
at Bell Labs.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.835
Oh, you guys
invented stereo.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.395
- Eh...
- Tony Soprano.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.930
What're you in for?

22:22.974 --> 22:24.965
- Sinus infection.
- Oh.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.343
They were going to enlarge the opening
in my lower right maxillary sinus,

22:28.380 --> 22:30.280
and then they saw
some stuff they didn't like,

22:30.315 --> 22:33.250
so they're running tests.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.980
Another guinea pig.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.547
Thank you
for giving my kid that CD.

22:39.591 --> 22:42.219
Tony Soprano?

22:43.729 --> 22:47.028
- Original G.
- Yeah, whatever.

22:47.065 --> 22:50.193
Why don't you come by
my joint later on tonight?

22:50.235 --> 22:52.999
Gonna have the fight
on satellite.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.348
Not even
a courtesy call,

23:03.382 --> 23:05.748
and you try to poach
my company?

23:05.784 --> 23:08.412
No disrespect, Tony.
You've been in a coma.

23:08.453 --> 23:12.856
That give you carte blanche?
Huh?

23:12.891 --> 23:16.190
lt's that fucking John.
He's sitting in the can.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.128
The feds are trying
to take everything he's got.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.860
- He's in a panic state.
- l'm sensitive to that.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.959
But whatever happens
to Barone Sanitation,

23:24.002 --> 23:27.665
l gotta be kept on.
l need that W-2.

23:27.706 --> 23:32.507
And as you can see,
l'm facing a long convalescence here.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.775
And Barone is my secondary insurance
carrier. l need it.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.544
John's gonna take care of you.
You know that, Tony.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.711
But what you're asking?
25/% of the sale price,

23:41.753 --> 23:44.051
years' salary
till retirement,

23:44.089 --> 23:48.082
plus skim?
Come on.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.526
Look, l don't
wanna argue.

23:50.562 --> 23:55.022
l'm not well, so l'll give John
a break on the skim.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.967
Getting two Gs
a week now.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.870
How many stops
we base that on?

24:03.008 --> 24:06.671
Ho! How many stops?

24:06.711 --> 24:08.736
- 11.
- The fuck you talking about?!

24:08.780 --> 24:12.375
- lt's at least 25.
- 25.

24:12.417 --> 24:15.682
What? Yeah.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.623
All right,
take the skim on 20.

24:19.658 --> 24:23.253
1,500 a week, but l stay on
the payroll as is.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.696
All l can do is deliver
the message, Anthony.

24:26.731 --> 24:31.293
You got your head
up your ass today.

24:31.336 --> 24:34.066
- What's going on?
- My Aunt Dottie's been sick.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.335
Call l got?

24:36.374 --> 24:38.740
She just died.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.837
Oh.

24:44.749 --> 24:47.479
Sorry.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.787
You were close?

24:55.093 --> 24:57.823
Your mom's sister
or your dad's?

24:57.863 --> 25:01.799
Mom's.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.859
She must be
broken up, huh?

25:04.903 --> 25:06.564
Here we are.

25:06.605 --> 25:09.665
Guess your brother
and sister coming in?

25:09.708 --> 25:12.074
Yeah.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.635
Your aunt,
she's the nun.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.341
- Yeah.
- Always wondered.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.509
They got hair
under there?

25:19.551 --> 25:22.281
Yeah, short.

25:25.390 --> 25:27.915
Well maybe you don't
wanna talk about it.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.291
Yeah.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.064
Those wedding rings
they wear...

25:38.103 --> 25:41.504
are they really
married to Jesus?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.531
So l understand.

25:49.748 --> 25:53.707
T, this is the guy,
the paramedic.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.748
''Wallet biopsy''?
Nice.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.656
Very nice.

26:01.693 --> 26:04.594
These people are saying l took money
from your wallet? Fuck that.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.119
Whoa whoa whoa.
What'd you say?

26:06.164 --> 26:08.155
l was looking
for proof of insurance.

26:08.199 --> 26:12.795
- l was only doing my job.
- They heard a lot of that at Nuremberg.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.567
You owe me two K.
lt was gone from my wallet.

26:16.608 --> 26:17.973
l don't have
that kind of money.

26:18.009 --> 26:21.069
One week, Rudy Diaz,

26:21.112 --> 26:22.670
or you'll need
a paramedic.

26:28.553 --> 26:29.918
Oh, nice of you
to come by.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.479
We'll see you
next week, huh?

26:31.523 --> 26:33.491
All this activity, Tony,
are you getting any rest?

26:33.525 --> 26:36.050
Absolutely. The guys
are just leaving.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.119
Carmela.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.765
So, you two came together.
You talking now?

26:46.805 --> 26:49.774
Mom apologized to me.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.867
And he got a job
at Blockbuster.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.676
Good. Well l'm glad
to see you made up.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.274
- Yeah, get 'em, man.
- Know what l'm saying?

26:58.316 --> 27:00.546
Fucker keeps
dropping his hands.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.644
Your boy's
getting tired.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.958
Fool's costing me
50 Gs.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.153
Who you place
your action with?

27:09.194 --> 27:12.186
- Pinnacle.
- Online?

27:12.230 --> 27:13.754
What price they give
you on Alvarez?

27:13.798 --> 27:16.062
350.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.796
- Damn!
- Oh man.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.703
Hold the motherfucker
steady!

27:22.607 --> 27:25.201
My friend here'll
give you 375.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.438
Right, Paulie?

27:27.479 --> 27:31.142
He don't even
wanna fight, man.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.446
Wonder what kind
of health insurance he's got.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.146
lt's a life of abuse.

27:35.186 --> 27:38.121
Yes, well he
is a boxer.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.124
lt's the same
for everybody.

27:40.158 --> 27:43.252
Look at you, T.
You do your uncle a kindness,

27:43.294 --> 27:45.455
you get shot
for your efforts.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.398
You think you got family,
but in the end,

27:48.433 --> 27:51.300
they fuck you too.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.464
He's grieving.
His aunt just died.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.873
l tell ya, we each
and every one of us,

27:57.909 --> 28:00.935
we're alone in the ring,
fighting for our lives,

28:00.979 --> 28:04.107
- just like that poor prick.
- Well, that's one way to look at it.

28:04.149 --> 28:06.515
- You got a better one?
- Don't get me started.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.542
- lt's complicated.
- You think l'm stupid?!

28:08.586 --> 28:13.546
lt's actually an illusion
those two boxers are separate entities.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.253
- What the fuck?
- lllusion?

28:16.294 --> 28:19.991
Their separate entities is simply
the way we choose to perceive them.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.226
- l didn't chose nothing.
- lt's physics.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.758
Schrödinger's equation.

28:24.803 --> 28:28.671
The boxers, you, me-- we're all part
of the same quantum field.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.107
You ever substitute teach
at Carver Middle School?

28:31.142 --> 28:34.805
He's a rocket scientist,
for Christ's sake. Bell Labs.

28:34.846 --> 28:38.304
Shit. Lift it up,
nigga!

28:38.349 --> 28:40.715
You were saying?

28:40.752 --> 28:43.915
Well, think of the two boxers
as ocean waves

28:43.955 --> 28:46.219
or currents of air,
two tornadoes, say.

28:46.257 --> 28:49.556
They appear to be two things, right?
Two separate things.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.461
But they're not.
Tornadoes are just wind,

28:52.497 --> 28:55.091
the wind stirred up
in different directions.

28:55.133 --> 28:58.068
The fact is, nothing is separate--
everything's connected.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.037
Everything is everything.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.869
- l'm down with that.
- Get the fuck out of here.

29:02.907 --> 29:06.138
The universe is just
one big soup of molecules...

29:06.177 --> 29:08.372
...bumping up against
one another.

29:08.413 --> 29:12.509
The shapes we see exist only in our
own consciousness.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.882
Keshawn, don't make me
come over there.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.649
You're so fucking smart,
fix that TV.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.251
Okay okay.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.266
Besides the financial ramifications,

29:31.302 --> 29:34.396
he says there's the issue of his W-2
and health insurance.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.135
That selfish prick.

29:37.175 --> 29:40.008
l'm sitting in here
facing a shitstorm

29:40.044 --> 29:43.104
and all he can think
about is himself?!

29:45.049 --> 29:47.176
As far as
the sale's concerned,

29:47.218 --> 29:49.584
that ship has sailed.
lt's going through,

29:49.621 --> 29:53.853
and as a friend,
l would appreciate Tony's help.

29:53.892 --> 29:57.658
Because he's a friend,
here's what l'm willing to do.

29:57.695 --> 30:01.927
Cinelli will retain him as waste
management consultant for two years.

30:01.966 --> 30:06.926
During that time, he can keep his
fucking W-2 and his health insurance.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.964
Plus 5/%
of the sale price.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.172
And we lease him
a new car.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.646
Are you fuckin'
kidding me?

30:16.681 --> 30:19.775
l told them l need
that W-2 in perpetuity,

30:19.818 --> 30:23.049
and 5/% of the fucking
sale price?!

30:23.087 --> 30:25.647
He thinks 'cause l'm
in this weakened condition,

30:25.690 --> 30:28.056
he can take advantage.
Well, he can go fuck himself.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.424
l'm just telling you
what Phil told me, Ton'.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.190
You tell Jason
before he sells,

30:32.230 --> 30:34.255
he better understand
his obligation!

31:31.556 --> 31:33.023
What's up, Paulie?

31:33.057 --> 31:35.423
Since even with Tony's advice,
you seem determined

31:35.460 --> 31:38.190
to sell your father's company,
there's something you should know.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.426
Whatever happens,
we gotta be taken care of.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.730
Yeah, of course.
l'm going to honor whatever provisions

31:43.768 --> 31:45.360
- are in the contract.
- Fuck the contract.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.701
Tony's given years
of his life to that company,

31:47.739 --> 31:50.139
and he expects
to be duly compensated.

31:50.174 --> 31:52.472
Johnny Sack sure as shit
ain't gonna perform.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.876
- Who?
- Mr. Cinelli's waste management

31:54.913 --> 31:58.644
consultant. And since Johnny Sack
ain't gonna step up,

31:58.683 --> 32:01.379
guess what?
lt's coming out of your ass.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.444
You know, l'm starting to feel
a little intimidated.

32:03.488 --> 32:05.353
As well you should,
my friend.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.756
A man who teaches skiing
for a living

32:07.792 --> 32:10.158
ought to look after
his physical condition,

32:10.194 --> 32:12.958
wouldn't you say?
His knees.

32:12.997 --> 32:14.965
Kid, you wouldn't be in this
situation

32:14.999 --> 32:17.263
if you'd listened to Tony
in the first place.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.396
He's looking out for you.
He doesn't wanna see you get hurt.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.733
l got a lot on my
mind these days.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.745
l don't need
this shit.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.850
Jason, we shook hands.
A deal's a deal.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.653
There's lifetime employees
who expect compensation.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.684
lt's only equitable. Now if you're
willing to take care of that,

32:43.728 --> 32:45.423
maybe we could
still work things out.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.397
Tony Soprano, right?

32:47.432 --> 32:49.366
Fuck that and fuck him.
He's your problem.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.198
- Look, the numbers just don't work.
- Jason!

32:52.236 --> 32:54.397
l'm going
to the buffet table.

32:54.439 --> 32:57.533
Be right there, Mom.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.839
lf l give Tony what he wants,
l lose money on the sale.

32:59.877 --> 33:03.278
- l can't do that to my mom.
- Kid, you work it out any way you want,

33:03.314 --> 33:05.805
- but nobody's backing out of the deal.
- Mr. Cinelli, l'm sorry,

33:05.850 --> 33:07.943
but the bottom line is l'm not selling
the company to you.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.819
There are other buyers out there.
Tony was quite clear about that.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.982
l'll tell you the fuckin' bottom line,
laddy buck.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.151
The Barone routes
are now Cinelli routes.

33:15.193 --> 33:16.751
That's that.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.638
T.

33:36.414 --> 33:39.383
Horrible thing.
They brought this little girl in,

33:39.417 --> 33:42.545
she's got third-degree burns
on 80/% of her body.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.885
You wouldn't believe
the week l've had.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.216
What?

33:49.260 --> 33:52.388
There's a little girl
burned in there.

33:52.430 --> 33:56.230
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, T.

33:56.267 --> 33:59.361
No. Now what the fuck
is with you?

33:59.404 --> 34:02.237
And l want some answers, 'cause you're
starting to drive me fuckin' nuts.

34:03.641 --> 34:05.370
This remains between us?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.844
'Course.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.871
My aunt who died--

34:11.916 --> 34:13.907
she wasn't my aunt.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.545
She was my mother.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.681
What?
Your aunt, the nun...

34:20.725 --> 34:22.192
was your mother?

34:22.226 --> 34:25.422
Some cocksucker G.l.
knocked her up during the war.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.158
Russ.

34:27.197 --> 34:30.099
- So what was your mother?
- My ma's my aunt.

34:30.134 --> 34:33.934
She adopted me
to hide the family shame.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.166
Believe this shit?

34:36.206 --> 34:37.799
All l did for her.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.277
Not only is my ma
not my ma,

34:41.312 --> 34:44.179
who the fuck even knows
who this Russ bastard is?

34:47.018 --> 34:51.045
Worst thing,
l'm not who l am.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.989
lt's like my whole
life is a joke,

34:54.025 --> 34:56.016
a big fuckin'
joke on me.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.573
- What's going on?
- This ain't your route no more.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.168
lt's ours. Cinelli.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.771
What do you mean?
l have this route for five years.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.339
Stupid fuck.

35:52.383 --> 35:54.078
Fuck this.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.918
Papi!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.331
Papi!

36:10.368 --> 36:12.700
Papi!

36:14.071 --> 36:16.938
Papi! Papi!

36:16.974 --> 36:19.067
Papi!

36:19.110 --> 36:21.510
Papi!

36:29.754 --> 36:32.484
Get back in your pajamas,

36:32.523 --> 36:36.323
go to bed, eat nothing but gallons
of ice cream, tons of pizza...

36:38.162 --> 36:40.255
Who's there?

36:41.299 --> 36:43.733
Oh, hi Paulie.

36:43.768 --> 36:47.101
You didn't go to your mother's funeral.
lt's a sin.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.936
Some mother. Even a rat don't
abandon its own children.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.033
No, you should
feel sorry for her.

36:52.076 --> 36:54.442
She's gonna have
to face St. Peter

36:54.478 --> 36:56.776
with this stain
on her.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.282
- l hope she rots in hell!
- Don't say that!

36:59.317 --> 37:01.342
And you.
l was your meal ticket,

37:01.385 --> 37:03.717
the goose
with the golden eggs!

37:03.754 --> 37:06.552
Look at this place.
Who set you up here?

37:06.591 --> 37:09.719
Not that fuckin'
brother of mine or Rose.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.354
They never provided
you with shit!

37:12.396 --> 37:15.126
Well, your real children
can start now.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.367
l went without,
so you could have.

37:20.404 --> 37:24.397
The mink coat, the massage chair
from Sharper's lmage,

37:25.843 --> 37:27.970
the flat-screen TV.

37:28.012 --> 37:31.277
$2,000 bucks
for a woman l don't even know!

37:31.315 --> 37:33.545
Paulie!

37:44.562 --> 37:46.621
Paulie, please.

37:46.664 --> 37:49.827
You're on your own.
l never wanna see you again.

37:59.677 --> 38:01.804
l told you. lt's a different
corporate culture.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.609
l tried to redefine
the deal.

38:03.648 --> 38:06.776
You shouldn't have made the deal without
talking to me in the first place!

38:06.817 --> 38:08.842
Well God damn it,
how was l supposed to know?

38:08.886 --> 38:12.083
l made it perfectly clear:
Give up part of your profits.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.318
Thanks to you,
a man is beaten half to death.

38:14.358 --> 38:15.950
While his little boy
was watching.

38:15.993 --> 38:17.460
And it's
all over the media!

38:17.495 --> 38:21.158
lt's not fair.
The business belongs to my family.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.462
''Fair''?

38:23.501 --> 38:25.731
You fuckin' believe
this shit?

38:25.770 --> 38:27.601
You remind me of my kid.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.402
Talk to the Katrina victims
about fair.

38:30.441 --> 38:32.966
Talk to Paulie here.
He'll tell you about fair!

38:33.010 --> 38:35.410
- Absolutely.
- You're worse than my son!

38:35.446 --> 38:37.710
- Get him the fuck outta here!
- Hey!

38:43.220 --> 38:45.518
How was l supposed to know?
My family kept me in the dark.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.923
What kind of pathetic fuckin' excuse
is that?! Don't you communicate?

38:48.959 --> 38:51.928
You make me sick,
you fucking baby.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.873
Shoot me one time,
one time only, you heard?

39:03.908 --> 39:06.274
Fleshy part of the thigh,
like you said.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.437
There's only 7,000 here.
l said eight.

39:08.479 --> 39:11.642
Hey hey hey, l get my little brother
to do it for less, believe that.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.674
Trust me, you gotta go outside
the family for something like this.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.983
You don't want
people knowing.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.548
That way you can blame it
on Dr. Droop or whoever.

39:20.591 --> 39:23.719
7,000's all l got.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.752
Okay.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.190
l don't wanna know
when it's coming. You decide.

39:33.938 --> 39:36.600
Get this...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.540
lt says here that if the history
of the planet

39:38.576 --> 39:41.568
was represented
by the Empire State Building,

39:41.612 --> 39:44.080
the time that human beings
have been on earth

39:44.115 --> 39:48.074
would only be a postage stamp
at the very top.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.577
You realize how insignificant
that makes us?

39:51.622 --> 39:53.783
l don't feel that way.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.595
There he is.

39:58.629 --> 40:01.928
- Hi, Chris.
- Hesh, how are you?

40:01.966 --> 40:04.025
Great to see you
looking so robust.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.935
- Hey.
- How you doing?

40:06.971 --> 40:08.700
- Beth wanted to come.
- Yeah, sure.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.674
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.370
So how's Eli?

40:13.411 --> 40:16.710
l hear that with the physical therapy,
they got him using a walker.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.977
He's doing better.
Thank you.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.149
Hey, Tony.

40:22.186 --> 40:23.710
Okay to visit?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.619
Yeah yeah, sure.

40:26.891 --> 40:30.520
My nephew Christopher,
Pastor Bob.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.825
Hesh Rabkin,
his daughter Beth.

40:32.863 --> 40:36.196
- Hi.
- How you feeling?

40:36.233 --> 40:38.224
Physically,
a little better than l was.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.829
So maybe you're right.
That prayer business works.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.106
l brought you something.

40:45.142 --> 40:47.269
- ''Born Again.''
- Charles Colson.

40:47.311 --> 40:49.006
The Watergate guy.

40:49.046 --> 40:50.513
Friend of mine
did time with him.

40:50.548 --> 40:54.211
A ruthless, powerful man
who thought he was above the law.

40:54.251 --> 40:56.913
He committed crimes
and then went to prison.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.980
And then he found Jesus,
and everything changed.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.321
Became a different man.

41:04.328 --> 41:06.319
Yeah, so?

41:08.699 --> 41:10.667
Salvation
isn't just about

41:10.701 --> 41:13.135
being saved from hell
after you die.

41:13.170 --> 41:16.731
lt's also about being saved from
yourself while you're still alive.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.543
l hope when you get
out of the hospital

41:21.579 --> 41:24.776
that you'll join us at the Church
of the Open Door of the Redeemer.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.678
Well it must be nice

41:29.720 --> 41:31.847
to have something
to hold onto.

41:33.924 --> 41:35.892
Maybe.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.701
- Hmm.
- What?

41:44.735 --> 41:48.796
Dinosaurs.
My kids can't get enough.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.467
Yeah yeah, me too.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.001
Every since l saw King Kong
kick their ass in the original.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.172
My son loves
dinosaurs too.

41:57.214 --> 41:59.148
- That's interesting.
- What?

41:59.183 --> 42:01.208
Some people would
have you believe

42:01.252 --> 42:03.516
dinosaurs existed
millions of years ago.

42:03.554 --> 42:06.216
lt's just not true.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.385
God created the earth
6,000 years ago.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.360
And l tell my kids,
you have to remember,

42:11.395 --> 42:15.092
dinosaurs and human beings
lived on the earth at the same time.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.159
What, like
''The Flintstones''?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.171
lt's in the Bible.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.867
Yeah but what about all that
carbon-dating stuff?

42:23.908 --> 42:26.376
A lot of scientists
would disagree with you.

42:26.410 --> 42:29.868
Well, l think you'll find
all those people have an agenda, Tony--

42:29.914 --> 42:34.112
evolution, which is
Satan's plan to deny God.

42:34.151 --> 42:38.247
Evolution and salvation
are mutually exclusive.

42:38.289 --> 42:41.918
Guy next door's a scientist.
Think he'd disagree with you big time.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.688
Then that man's
not saved.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.764
Read about Mr. Colson.
We'll talk later.

42:55.706 --> 42:58.368
What's he saying? There were dinosaurs
back with Adam and Eve?

42:58.409 --> 42:59.842
- l guess.
- No way.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.742
T rex in the garden
of Eden?

43:01.779 --> 43:03.542
Adam and Eve
would be running all the time,

43:03.581 --> 43:07.540
scared shitless.
But the Bible says it was paradise.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.450
You can disagree
with Evangelicals,

43:09.486 --> 43:10.783
but they're great friends
of the Jews

43:10.821 --> 43:14.484
because lsrael
is the Holy Land.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.584
You wait.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.836
Hey, how ya doing?

43:28.872 --> 43:31.534
- Hi.
- l'm gonna go to the bathroom.

43:36.013 --> 43:37.674
Your color's better.

43:37.715 --> 43:42.118
So Mr. Wizard, you were talking
about tornados.

43:44.655 --> 43:47.146
You know what
the lndians say about the wind?

43:47.191 --> 43:49.250
- No.
- They say that sometimes

43:49.293 --> 43:51.887
we go around feeling pity
for ourselves,

43:51.929 --> 43:55.160
but behind our back,
a great wind is carrying us.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.759
We don't see we're part
of a much bigger reality.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.668
- Then we die.
- Why are you so interested in all this?

44:05.409 --> 44:10.108
l was in this coma
and, uh...

44:10.147 --> 44:11.978
look, l don't
remember nothing,

44:12.016 --> 44:14.416
but before l woke up,

44:14.451 --> 44:17.943
l felt like l was being pulled
towards something.

44:19.823 --> 44:23.156
And l don't
wanna go back.

44:23.193 --> 44:26.458
And my wife told me
l woke up at one point and said...

44:28.866 --> 44:31.391
''Who am l?

44:31.435 --> 44:35.337
Where am l going?''

44:35.372 --> 44:37.340
Kinda makes you wonder,

44:37.374 --> 44:40.639
about heaven and hell.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.875
That presupposes a duality
of good and evil.

44:43.914 --> 44:45.882
You know it gets us
back to the idea

44:45.916 --> 44:50.114
of separate,
opposing entities.

44:50.154 --> 44:51.746
You know where l go
with that.

44:51.789 --> 44:54.155
But this Bible guy
l know says you're going to hell.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.988
Maybe he's right.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.893
Got my test results back.

44:58.929 --> 45:02.330
Laryngeal cancer.

45:02.366 --> 45:04.994
Jesus, l'm sorry.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.969
You know l was thinking,
maybe you could do me a favor

45:07.004 --> 45:09.438
and, uh, you know
what's the term,

45:09.473 --> 45:12.533
''whack'' me?

45:12.576 --> 45:15.636
Sorry, bad joke.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.794
- Walking alone again.
- What, l'm gonna wait for Vito?

45:32.830 --> 45:35.560
Hour and a half
to take a dump, that guy.

45:35.599 --> 45:38.363
Could build a jetty
with what comes out.

45:46.877 --> 45:50.904
Little Paulie tells me
you didn't go to your aunt's funeral.

45:50.948 --> 45:54.213
And l'll tell you
something else--

45:54.251 --> 45:56.344
l'm done with Nucci.

45:56.386 --> 45:59.412
Four Gs a month
for that nursing home? Fuck that.

45:59.456 --> 46:00.923
What are you gonna do,
throw her out on the street?

46:00.958 --> 46:02.585
Way l see it,

46:02.626 --> 46:04.321
serves her right.

46:04.361 --> 46:06.591
What the fuck, Paulie?

46:06.630 --> 46:08.621
That woman loved you.
She fed you.

46:08.665 --> 46:10.929
How many times she bail you out
of the can when you were a kid?

46:10.968 --> 46:13.402
Huh? Am l right?

46:15.339 --> 46:17.239
l'll tell ya
what really fries me--

46:17.274 --> 46:20.107
lt's not Nucci.
lt's Dottie.

46:20.144 --> 46:22.874
l know to your way of thinking,
you didn't have a great mother--

46:22.913 --> 46:25.006
- Ho!
- All l'm saying,

46:25.048 --> 46:26.948
Livia, with all her faults,
never abandoned you.

46:26.984 --> 46:29.646
For Christ's sake, Paulie.
You know what your problem is?

46:29.686 --> 46:31.415
You go around
in pity for yourself.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.548
You think
you got it bad.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.558
You're not stuck
in some hospital room

46:35.592 --> 46:37.287
with fucking tubes
coming out of you.

46:37.327 --> 46:39.420
You can eat food
like a normal person.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.694
T, l never meant
to trivialize your situation.

46:42.733 --> 46:46.134
Well, you gotta get beyond this petty
bullshit, Paulie.

46:46.170 --> 46:48.468
You're part of
something bigger.

46:48.505 --> 46:50.166
When you gonna
learn that?

46:57.047 --> 46:59.106
- My ass!
- Marvin?!

46:59.149 --> 47:01.640
Ow! They shot me
in my ass!

47:01.685 --> 47:04.119
They shot me in my ass!

47:04.154 --> 47:06.281
Marvin!

47:12.362 --> 47:15.160
Pearl's oyster bar--
the lobster roll.

47:16.834 --> 47:21.032
Listen, Ton', that package,
from Vito and Paulie?

47:21.071 --> 47:24.529
l have to believe
that there was more there.

47:24.575 --> 47:27.373
Sure. So?

47:27.411 --> 47:31.370
Vito especially
is somebody you should watch.

47:34.885 --> 47:37.786
Mr. Soprano?
Good morning, Mrs. Soprano.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.550
Ah, the bird of prey.

47:39.590 --> 47:43.390
Okay, it looks like your last drainage
tube is coming out today.

47:43.427 --> 47:46.021
Dr. Plepler says you're stable
and the pain is manageable

47:46.063 --> 47:48.395
so that's good news.
You're husband's coming home.

47:48.432 --> 47:51.094
- Are you sure he's ready?
- What does she give a shit?

47:51.134 --> 47:52.965
She's trying to save a buck.

47:53.003 --> 47:56.769
Hold on a minute.
Guy next door-- Mr. Schwinn.

47:56.807 --> 48:00.538
Had surgery
this morning, cancer.

48:00.577 --> 48:01.737
You know anything
about it?

48:01.778 --> 48:04.008
l heard they
removed his larynx.

48:15.826 --> 48:17.885
...wrote attorney
Jim Sokoloff--

48:17.928 --> 48:20.123
On the city of 6,000--

48:20.163 --> 48:22.131
''Gitanos.''

48:22.165 --> 48:25.498
That's a Mexican word
for gypsies.

48:25.535 --> 48:27.901
Tony? How are you?

48:27.938 --> 48:30.634
Hey!
All right.

48:30.674 --> 48:32.699
l made you
some stuffed zucchini.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.041
- He can't eat that.
- Oh oh, l'm sorry.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.603
lt was thoughtful
anyways.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.548
Listen, my condolences
regarding Dick.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.982
- You get my flowers?
- Oh yeah.

48:41.018 --> 48:42.212
They were beautiful.

48:42.252 --> 48:44.311
- Have a seat.
- Oh thank you.

48:46.957 --> 48:50.688
Uh, Jas told me
about the conversation you had.

48:50.727 --> 48:53.287
l can only imagine
how upset you must be.

48:53.330 --> 48:55.924
Well it is a very
unfortunate situation.

48:55.966 --> 48:58.992
Jason just doesn't understand
how the business works.

48:59.036 --> 49:01.664
- That's for sure.
- No, it's not his fault.

49:01.705 --> 49:05.539
lt's my fault. Dick and l purposely
kept him in the dark.

49:05.575 --> 49:06.940
Blame me, not him.

49:06.977 --> 49:08.501
You're not involved
in this, Helen.

49:08.545 --> 49:10.206
l was too wrapped up

49:10.247 --> 49:13.876
in my own grief.
l didn't realize...

49:13.917 --> 49:17.011
He's my boy, Tony.
He's my baby.

49:17.054 --> 49:19.614
lt'd kill me
if anything happened to him.

49:19.656 --> 49:21.089
What are you
talkin' about?

49:21.124 --> 49:24.184
Tony, please. You have a son.
l'm begging you.

49:26.430 --> 49:28.364
Helen, believe me,
nothin's gonna happen to him.

49:28.398 --> 49:31.162
l'm his mother, Tony.
l love him.

49:31.201 --> 49:33.965
lf anyone has to pay
for this, let it be me.

49:34.004 --> 49:36.529
How many times l gotta tell you?
lt's gonna be fine.

49:36.573 --> 49:38.234
But, Tony,
do l have your word?

49:38.275 --> 49:41.301
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
you got my word.

50:07.771 --> 50:09.762
Especially good week
this week.

50:13.076 --> 50:15.010
Good.

50:16.079 --> 50:18.104
l know
how good you feel.

50:18.148 --> 50:22.414
l was only in the hospital overnight. l
couldn't wait to get out.

50:22.452 --> 50:24.215
Hold on.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.754
You wanna go in,
say goodbye?

50:33.630 --> 50:36.292
No.

50:50.714 --> 50:52.614
l wanted to make sure
you had this before you checked out.

50:52.649 --> 50:53.775
Whoa whoa.
Not here.

50:53.817 --> 50:56.251
lt's all right.

50:56.286 --> 50:57.719
Let's go.

50:57.754 --> 51:00.120
- Ton'?
- Let's go.

51:17.707 --> 51:21.006
Hey. H-hey!

51:32.189 --> 51:34.589
l'm gonna go get the car.
l'll follow you home.

51:34.624 --> 51:36.615
- Janice.
- What?

51:38.128 --> 51:41.120
Supposed to be dead.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.223
Now l'm alive.

51:45.669 --> 51:47.694
l'm the luckiest guy
in the whole world.

51:49.406 --> 51:51.738
Listen, after this...

51:54.544 --> 51:56.603
from now on,
every day is a gift.

51:56.646 --> 51:58.739
Yeah.

52:00.016 --> 52:02.177
l'm gonna go get the car.

52:13.497 --> 52:16.193
Tony? Phil Leotardo
is here to see you.

52:16.233 --> 52:17.666
- Hmm.
- 10 minutes.

52:17.701 --> 52:19.635
You're supposed
to be resting.

52:19.669 --> 52:21.864
Hey, blondie.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.640
lt's all you, you know.

52:25.675 --> 52:27.165
The reason l'm back here.

52:27.210 --> 52:29.701
No, it's not just me
by any means.

52:31.515 --> 52:33.745
Thank you
for saying that.

52:41.291 --> 52:43.816
- Anthony.
- Hey.

52:47.531 --> 52:49.863
Johnny doesn't want
another unfortunate incident.

52:49.900 --> 52:53.563
He's willing to let you keep
your paycheck and your W-2 for 10 years.

52:53.603 --> 52:55.798
To replace the skim,

52:55.839 --> 52:58.808
he'll jack up your share
of the sale price to 1 2/%.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.171
No more skim.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.887
Truth be told,

53:13.924 --> 53:18.088
there's enough garbage
for everybody.

53:18.128 --> 53:22.064
- Does that mean we got a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

53:22.098 --> 53:23.588
Be well.

54:45.715 --> 54:47.910
Aw, fuck!

54:49.019 --> 54:50.919
Guess what, fuckin'
mama's boy?!

54:50.954 --> 54:52.751
You're kicking up
four grand to me every month.

54:52.789 --> 54:55.451
l don't care if you're in Deer Valley
or Death Valley!

54:55.492 --> 54:57.483
Four grand,
every goddamn month!

54:57.527 --> 55:00.621
And if you ever mention
a word of this to Tony,

55:00.664 --> 55:02.461
l'll stick this
up your ass

55:02.499 --> 55:05.798
and pull the trigger
till the bullets come out your eyes.
