to your house

14:06.250 --> 14:07.790

14:11.790 --> 14:14.460
But I have to ask --

14:14.460 --> 14:15.830
You didn't do that, right?

14:15.830 --> 14:17.080
No.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.120
Great.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.380
Good.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.080

one other thing.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.790
He insists there was
someone else at your house.
