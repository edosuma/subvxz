00:23.756 --> 00:29.087
The first time I made someone
laugh I was in the first grade.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.253
It was a play,
and it was about a farm.

00:32.256 --> 00:33.686
And I was a cow.

00:33.688 --> 00:36.621
Every kid in the play
had one line.

00:36.623 --> 00:38.354
We would march up
to the microphone,

00:38.356 --> 00:39.886
and say our line
and then that was it.

00:39.888 --> 00:41.720
I was such a little try-hard.

00:41.722 --> 00:44.387
I practiced my line over
and over again.

00:44.389 --> 00:47.653
So I could get it right and
everyone would love me.

00:47.655 --> 00:51.522
And by the time it was my turn,
I was so ready.

00:51.524 --> 00:54.388
I just marched right up
to the microphone

00:54.390 --> 00:58.287
and I said my line
really loud and confidently.

00:58.289 --> 00:59.822
What should we do?

01:01.823 --> 01:03.455
They just started laughing.

01:03.457 --> 01:06.722
That was not the reaction
I was expecting.

01:06.724 --> 01:08.755
I thought I had blown my shot,

01:08.757 --> 01:11.187
I thought I had blown
my one line.

01:11.189 --> 01:13.321
I was washed up at age 7,

01:13.323 --> 01:16.554
And I went backstage and
I was beating myself up.

01:16.556 --> 01:18.488
Like, "Emily, you suck...

01:18.490 --> 01:21.258
"Can't you go one day
without fucking something up?"

01:21.524 --> 01:23.623
When my mom came backstage
to congratulate me,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.489
I was just so upset.

01:25.491 --> 01:28.522
I asked her,
"Why were they laughing at me?

01:28.524 --> 01:29.890
"Did I do something wrong?"

01:29.892 --> 01:32.822
And she just smiled
and she said,

01:32.824 --> 01:35.923
"They weren't laughing at you
because you did something wrong.

01:35.925 --> 01:38.724
"They were laughing at you
because you're funny."

01:38.726 --> 01:40.357
It was like a light switch

01:40.359 --> 01:42.356
went off in my brain
and I thought,

01:42.358 --> 01:45.724
"Hey, if I can make people
laugh on accident,

01:45.726 --> 01:47.822
"maybe I could do it on purpose.

01:47.824 --> 01:52.092
"And I've been trying to do it
on purpose ever since."

01:58.826 --> 02:00.693
So, do you have some stuff
prepared for us?

02:01.225 --> 02:03.692
Yes, I have some characters
and some impressions.

02:04.193 --> 02:05.694
Great. You have one minute.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.423
Wait, excuse me,
I thought that we...

02:09.425 --> 02:11.094
I was told I had three minutes.

02:11.292 --> 02:13.727
You did,
but your story took so long.

02:15.894 --> 02:17.359
There's a lot of people waiting.

02:19.659 --> 02:21.424
Right, okay...

02:21.426 --> 02:22.626
Sure...

02:25.694 --> 02:30.261
This first impression is
Holly Hunter at a garage sale.

02:31.161 --> 02:33.625
Hi, excuse me, miss. How much is
this stainless steel serving saucer?

02:33.627 --> 02:35.791
What? It's not for sale?
I don't understand.

02:35.793 --> 02:37.158
This is a garage sale,
is it not?

02:37.160 --> 02:39.259
You listen here, I have 79 cents
and I intend to spend it.

02:39.261 --> 02:40.726
Now tell me,
how much is this children's book

02:40.728 --> 02:42.193
"Sally Sells Seashells
by the Sea Shore"?

02:42.195 --> 02:44.460
A dollar? Shoot. What about
this Scissor Sisters CD?

02:44.462 --> 02:48.661
This is a little boy
trying to be macho in a mirror.

02:51.261 --> 02:52.526
We're divorced.

02:52.528 --> 02:54.029
OK...

02:56.462 --> 02:59.162
This is the girl
who's always cold.

03:00.894 --> 03:02.029
I'm cold.

03:03.063 --> 03:05.296
Brrrrrr...

03:05.830 --> 03:07.030
No, I don't want your jacket.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.594
This is Kristen Wig
discovering a murder scene.

03:09.596 --> 03:12.528
Oh my God, he's dead.
Somebody killed him.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.162
Help, quick. Call 911.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.795
This is a pug
turning into a baby.

03:26.363 --> 03:28.328
This an impression
of a Vine video

03:28.330 --> 03:30.031
of a girl at a BeyoncÃ© concert.

03:32.662 --> 03:34.563
Oh my God, BeyoncÃ©!

03:37.929 --> 03:39.761
Oh my God, BeyoncÃ©!

03:43.596 --> 03:45.064
Oh my God, Beyonce!

03:46.730 --> 03:48.130
Okay.

06:41.171 --> 06:41.903
Hey, guys.

06:41.905 --> 06:43.036
Hey, Emily.

06:43.038 --> 06:44.138
Where the hell
have you been, Emily?

06:44.140 --> 06:45.837
It's two
in the goddamn afternoon.

06:45.839 --> 06:50.938
I had an audition this morning
which I told you about yesterday.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.770
This is a team, Emily.

06:52.772 --> 06:54.638
You want to be
a part of it or not?

06:54.640 --> 06:55.805
It's editing.

06:55.807 --> 06:56.669
You don't do it as a team,
you do it alone.

06:56.671 --> 06:57.904
But we're doing it together.

06:57.906 --> 07:02.303
Okay, I'm sorry.
It ran long and traffic was...

07:02.305 --> 07:03.639
Just show me what you've got.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.837
<i>As Pharmtech pharmaceutical
reps,</i>

07:09.839 --> 07:12.904
<i>we're here to connect patients
with life-altering prescriptions</i>

07:12.906 --> 07:15.073
<i>they didn't even know they
needed.</i>

07:15.274 --> 07:17.937
<i>So talk to your doctor
about talking to their patients</i>

07:17.939 --> 07:20.604
<i>about the benefits of Hupertan
Rx.</i>

07:20.606 --> 07:23.240
<i>Because no one
should feel sleepy.</i>

07:24.240 --> 07:26.237
Fine, export this cut,

07:26.239 --> 07:29.608
and get it to Brinson
by the end of day for approval.

07:32.275 --> 07:33.207
Jesus.

07:34.374 --> 07:35.505
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.

07:35.507 --> 07:36.208
Why?

07:37.073 --> 07:37.838
I got your chart back and...

07:37.840 --> 07:38.771
You don't got a butt.

07:41.906 --> 07:43.373
I just don't understand.
What do you mean, Mr. But Butts?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.640
Hey...

07:44.642 --> 07:46.739
It's Dr. Butt Butts to you!

07:48.808 --> 07:50.940
Thanks so much,
that's our show!

07:56.808 --> 07:58.543
That was perfect...

07:59.408 --> 08:02.806
Hey guys! Great job tonight,
that was so good!

08:02.808 --> 08:05.276
You wanna go in?.

08:07.177 --> 08:09.207
That improv was so good
for being drunk.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.339
I know. I know.

08:10.341 --> 08:12.510
- And like you had...?
- I was drunk.

08:13.876 --> 08:15.473
I haven't seen you
around the theatre.

08:15.475 --> 08:16.675
Are you new in town?

08:16.677 --> 08:19.542
No, I've been around
pretty much constantly.

08:19.544 --> 08:21.177
I moved from Austin
about two years ago.

08:21.442 --> 08:23.243
Dude, I love Austin.

08:23.444 --> 08:25.245
South By Southwest!

08:25.477 --> 08:27.009
Yeah.

08:27.011 --> 08:29.574
Austin, it's pretty great, but
they call it "The Velvet Rut,"

08:29.576 --> 08:33.308
because it's so laid back that
people there lose their ambition.

08:33.309 --> 08:34.841
Velvet Rut, that's a good name
for something.

08:34.842 --> 08:36.177
That's funny.

08:37.977 --> 08:40.511
Did you guys know that Emily's got
over 20 million views on YouTube?

08:40.712 --> 08:41.775
Oh, my God.

08:41.777 --> 08:42.741
She's like a celebrity.

08:42.744 --> 08:45.375
It's exclusively
from perverts,

08:45.377 --> 08:46.708
mostly in the Ukraine.

08:46.710 --> 08:47.909
Oh my God.

08:47.911 --> 08:50.176
It's just this one video
that got out of control.

08:50.178 --> 08:51.377
What's the vid?

08:51.379 --> 08:53.942
Honestly,
it's too stupid to talk about.

08:53.944 --> 08:56.712
Wow, you have
really low self-esteem.

09:02.545 --> 09:04.409
Lucas, you teach a 401, right?

09:04.411 --> 09:05.509
Are you going to take it
for the eighth time?

09:05.511 --> 09:08.309
I'm taking it
for the eighth time.

09:08.311 --> 09:09.677
I'm already enrolled.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.875
You want me to get you
another round of something?

09:12.877 --> 09:14.244
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.

09:14.246 --> 09:17.714
And maybe later, I can
take you home and fuck you?

09:50.613 --> 09:52.347
Emily...

09:55.380 --> 09:57.348
Hey, is this funny?

09:57.748 --> 09:59.346
Is this funny?

09:59.348 --> 09:59.748
What?

10:00.948 --> 10:03.781
Where there's smoke,
there's me smoking weed?

10:04.415 --> 10:05.945
- Sure...
- Yeah?

10:05.947 --> 10:07.479
- Uh-huh.
- That's funny.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.547
Uh-huh.

10:17.815 --> 10:18.449
Woah!

10:19.181 --> 10:20.047
What are you doing?

10:20.049 --> 10:22.512
I'm just gonna tweet it out.

10:22.514 --> 10:24.215
- Dude, I'm...
- I know.

10:24.448 --> 10:26.613
See, I didn't want
to mess up the joke.

10:26.615 --> 10:28.314
I'm putting it away.

10:28.316 --> 10:29.913
Hey, Emily, I'm okay...

10:29.915 --> 10:30.914
We're okay?

10:30.916 --> 10:32.783
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're okay.

10:36.251 --> 10:37.781
What? Seriously?

10:37.783 --> 10:39.213
No, that's not my phone.

10:39.215 --> 10:42.449
Oh, fuck. Give me a minute.

10:46.784 --> 10:47.617
Oh, shit.

10:49.017 --> 10:51.514
It's my ex, I'm sorry.
We haven't talked for a while.

10:51.516 --> 10:52.716
Oh, yeah.

11:00.684 --> 11:03.414
Hey, I'm sorry
I didn't answer earlier

11:03.416 --> 11:06.084
I was swamped all day,
is everything okay?

11:08.950 --> 11:10.451
Oh my God.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.051
Oh...

11:13.383 --> 11:15.317
Oh my God, oh my God.

11:16.518 --> 11:17.619
Ahhh...

11:18.651 --> 11:20.419
How long does he have?

11:21.351 --> 11:22.317
Oh, no!

11:23.485 --> 11:25.052
Oh my God.

11:44.852 --> 11:47.184
- Hi, let me help you here.
- No. I got it.

11:47.186 --> 11:49.418
I've got plenty
of room back here,

11:49.420 --> 11:52.250
- Come on, it's no problem.
- I want to hold on to my bag.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.516
- You sure?
- Yes.

11:53.518 --> 11:56.420
Okay, go ahead
and get in the car.

11:56.885 --> 11:59.451
Right there.
My name is Ida.

11:59.453 --> 12:03.487
<i>â™ª Ida, Sweet as apple cider...</i>

12:03.686 --> 12:05.520
Welcome to Austin!

12:12.519 --> 12:15.687
I hope you enjoy the trip.
Is it business or pleasure?

12:17.687 --> 12:18.620
Neither.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.585
I'm a pretty good driver
most of the time.

12:22.587 --> 12:25.555
I hope you give me five stars.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.953
It would be helpful. Oops!

12:27.955 --> 12:29.055
Oops.

12:41.454 --> 12:43.387
- Hi.
- How can I help you?

12:43.389 --> 12:46.088
I'm here to see a patient,
Mr. Roosevelt.

12:46.322 --> 12:47.685
And you are...?

12:47.687 --> 12:49.121
I'm his...

12:49.388 --> 12:50.522
He's my cat.

12:51.389 --> 12:53.156
I'll let the vet
know you're here.

12:57.456 --> 12:58.322
Have a seat.

13:06.490 --> 13:07.557
Hey.

13:15.323 --> 13:16.424
You look great.

13:17.389 --> 13:18.191
Thank you.

13:18.490 --> 13:19.556
You look...

13:19.924 --> 13:20.590
very thin.

13:23.256 --> 13:24.089
So what happened?

13:25.190 --> 13:27.321
He hasn't been eating
for a week.

13:27.323 --> 13:28.955
Why didn't you call me earlier?

13:28.957 --> 13:31.157
I didn't want to bother you.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.390
The vet says that...

13:33.924 --> 13:35.490
it's kidney failure.

13:48.325 --> 13:49.292
Hello.

13:52.357 --> 13:53.192
Hello.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.258
This is Celeste.

13:56.525 --> 13:57.392
My girlfriend.

13:58.557 --> 14:01.324
Your girlfriend?
I didn't know you had a...

14:02.392 --> 14:03.857
It's so nice to meet you.

14:03.859 --> 14:04.957
I'm Emily.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.623
You've probably heard
a lot about me.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.493
Not much, actually.

14:09.825 --> 14:10.794
Well...

14:11.791 --> 14:13.692
Thank you for being here.

14:14.225 --> 14:15.857
I know that he was my cat,

14:15.859 --> 14:17.957
but Mr. Roosevelt
meant a lot to Eric.

14:17.959 --> 14:19.192
Yeah.

14:20.225 --> 14:22.526
Yeah, he means a lot to me too.

14:24.225 --> 14:26.527
Celeste and I live together.

14:27.425 --> 14:28.460
In our...?

14:29.725 --> 14:31.093
In my house.

14:33.893 --> 14:35.427
That's so nice.

14:46.194 --> 14:49.325
So we put him on fluids,
and he perked up quite a bit.

14:49.327 --> 14:52.295
And then he took a turn
for the worst.

14:52.562 --> 14:53.661
Worse.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.392
Worst.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.794
Which is it, turn for the worse?

14:57.395 --> 14:58.661
I never know.

14:59.228 --> 15:00.559
Turn for the worse...

15:00.561 --> 15:01.393
Right.

15:01.395 --> 15:02.128
Anyway...

15:05.561 --> 15:06.960
I'm sorry.

15:06.962 --> 15:08.858
He passed away.

15:17.962 --> 15:21.329
Who'll be handling
the medical paperwork?

15:23.962 --> 15:27.793
The cremation process can take
24 to 48 hours,

15:27.795 --> 15:29.630
depending on the backlog.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.961
Can I see him...?

15:31.963 --> 15:32.826
Before?

15:32.828 --> 15:34.163
Of course.

15:35.595 --> 15:37.563
Have you decided on an urn?

15:45.396 --> 15:47.230
I'll take the second cheapest.

16:02.497 --> 16:03.597
Oh...

16:04.398 --> 16:05.632
Um...

16:05.965 --> 16:08.197
I guess I'll call you
when he's done.

16:08.463 --> 16:12.497
And we can have a service
to pay our respects and...

16:13.497 --> 16:18.198
Thank you for taking care of him
while I was away.

16:20.464 --> 16:21.599
And...

16:22.398 --> 16:23.730
Sweetie...

16:23.732 --> 16:25.331
Shhh.

16:29.532 --> 16:31.166
It's gonna be okay.

16:36.398 --> 16:38.331
Well, I'll see you later.

16:41.398 --> 16:42.299
Where are you staying?

17:04.265 --> 17:05.696
Who wants some tea?

17:05.699 --> 17:07.400
Eric, Oolong?

17:07.934 --> 17:09.333
Yeah, sure.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.400
The house looks amazing.

17:15.465 --> 17:16.568
Celeste...

17:17.532 --> 17:19.733
You guys put in wood floors?

17:20.267 --> 17:22.398
Actually we had
a contractor come in

17:22.401 --> 17:24.601
and rip out the carpet and...

17:24.898 --> 17:27.632
Apparently these were original
to the house.

17:27.634 --> 17:29.669
I always hated the carpet.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.800
So this is the bathroom,
which you knew,

17:32.802 --> 17:35.434
- but now has extra towels.
- Fancy.

17:35.436 --> 17:36.767
And the guest room.

17:36.769 --> 17:39.469
Oh! Where's
all your band stuff?

17:39.702 --> 17:41.600
Your guitars and your amps?

17:41.602 --> 17:42.370
Out in the shed.

17:43.869 --> 17:46.266
- You practice in the shed?
- No, it's temporary storage.

17:46.268 --> 17:48.401
You know until
I figure out where to put it.

17:54.268 --> 17:56.136
Why didn't you tell me
about Celeste?

17:56.368 --> 17:58.403
Em, we haven't spoken

17:58.802 --> 18:01.668
since you broke up with me
over the phone.

18:06.803 --> 18:07.502
Are you okay?

18:08.869 --> 18:08.935
Oh my God, are you kidding me?
Of course I'm okay.

18:09.769 --> 18:10.933
I'm really happy for you.

18:10.935 --> 18:14.136
We gotta move on.
We've all moved on.

18:14.437 --> 18:17.302
I was talking
about Mr. Rosevelt.

18:18.803 --> 18:20.302
Oh...

18:20.304 --> 18:22.405
Yeah, I'll be okay.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.868
I don't really know what I'm
going to do financially.

18:26.870 --> 18:31.172
Or how I'm gonna get back to LA.
Flights are crazy expensive.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.334
This is good, right?

18:33.336 --> 18:34.770
This is...

18:36.503 --> 18:38.205
This is closure.

18:40.903 --> 18:41.805
Tea time.

18:42.671 --> 18:44.272
I hope I'm not interrupting.

18:45.437 --> 18:47.304
No, in fact I was
just on my way out.

18:48.406 --> 18:50.806
Catch up as much as you need to.

18:51.271 --> 18:53.472
You should drink that
while it's hot.

18:53.838 --> 18:55.236
Yes.

18:55.238 --> 18:56.705
That's usually how tea works.

18:57.406 --> 19:00.437
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.603
Okey dokey!

19:01.605 --> 19:03.105
Okey dokey...

19:03.738 --> 19:05.372
Eric, wait.

19:07.406 --> 19:08.703
Ummm...

19:08.705 --> 19:10.272
What's the WiFi password?

19:11.873 --> 19:13.506
Still the same.

19:13.805 --> 19:14.573
Cool.

20:19.608 --> 20:21.106
<i>...He felt her curves</i>

20:21.108 --> 20:25.807
<i>round his neck
like a yoke he knows</i>

20:25.809 --> 20:28.111
<i>he'll never forget</i>

20:28.642 --> 20:32.341
<i>The way she cut through his bed</i>

20:32.343 --> 20:36.610
<i>Like a snake would bite
through a cave of flesh</i>

20:36.943 --> 20:39.844
<i>But he holds her</i>

20:40.943 --> 20:44.576
<i>though she's broken</i>

20:46.677 --> 20:52.643
<i>He swears he don't care
where she's been</i>

20:55.678 --> 21:02.112
<i>He's tired of being human</i>

21:04.778 --> 21:07.776
<i>He wears her close
to the bone...</i>

22:04.314 --> 22:07.445
<i>KLONOPIN, take one tablet
by mouth twice a day</i>

22:08.614 --> 22:09.047
Emily?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.115
You okay?

22:12.414 --> 22:14.779
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm just urinating.

22:14.781 --> 22:18.681
Eric and I have reservations
at Justine's tonight.

22:18.981 --> 22:21.911
And I'm sure you have other
plans, but if you're not busy,

22:21.913 --> 22:24.681
then we'd love for you
to join us and our friends.

22:25.814 --> 22:26.849
No, I don't have plans,

22:28.148 --> 22:29.512
but I'm sure I can figure
something else out.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.412
Really?

22:30.414 --> 22:32.248
I know Eric wants you to come.

22:33.749 --> 22:34.912
He does?

22:34.914 --> 22:35.848
Yes.

22:39.949 --> 22:42.715
Emily,
you don't have to be alone.

22:54.717 --> 22:56.484
That's a spiffy shirt.

22:58.250 --> 22:58.850
Thanks.

23:02.349 --> 23:03.582
It's a...

23:04.517 --> 23:06.217
breathable cotton.

23:07.617 --> 23:08.717
So...

23:12.749 --> 23:13.851
Everybody ready?

23:14.316 --> 23:15.617
Aye aye, captain.

23:17.484 --> 23:19.151
Do you want to change
before we leave?

23:19.750 --> 23:22.452
Oh, I'm so sorry...

23:22.784 --> 23:25.315
When I took
an emergency flight to Austin,

23:25.317 --> 23:27.683
I didn't exactly think
to pack formal wear.

23:27.685 --> 23:29.549
That makes perfect sense.

23:29.551 --> 23:32.117
I'm sure
I have something you can wear.

23:33.684 --> 23:34.617
Great.

23:35.950 --> 23:39.085
<i>Why me,</i>

23:40.818 --> 23:47.086
<i>Why did you pick
on my heart to break?</i>

23:47.818 --> 23:51.453
<i>Why did you have to fool me?</i>

23:51.685 --> 23:56.318
So I would to propose a toast,
to the memory of Mr. Roosevelt.

23:56.651 --> 23:57.519
Oh, Jess.

24:05.353 --> 24:08.349
I don't know if you guys notice
anything different about me.

24:08.351 --> 24:09.454
I've been meditating.

24:10.985 --> 24:13.583
Yep, using an app
called <i>Mind Time</i>.

24:13.585 --> 24:14.618
Thank you.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.717
It's awesome.

24:15.719 --> 24:17.585
He is so calm, so peaceful.

24:17.587 --> 24:19.483
- Present.
- He's got this glow...

24:19.485 --> 24:20.483
I'm finally here.

24:20.485 --> 24:21.187
I can see it.

24:22.153 --> 24:22.754
- Free app?
- Yeah, free.

24:24.018 --> 24:25.821
I'll send it to you guys.
I get referrals...

24:27.852 --> 24:30.385
- Very cool.
- It's awesome.

24:30.387 --> 24:32.653
It's like, I don't know,
life-changing.

24:34.353 --> 24:36.151
So, Eric, how's your band doing?

24:36.153 --> 24:38.652
I saw you guys got a write-up
in the <i>Chronicle</i> last year.

24:38.654 --> 24:40.719
Eric's taking a break from
right now.

24:40.721 --> 24:42.354
He's getting
his real estate license.

24:42.621 --> 24:44.918
- I love houses.
- I know you do.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.685
Whoa, you're going to become
a real estate agent?

24:47.687 --> 24:51.688
Yeah, they say if you sell one,
you can be set for a year.

24:52.254 --> 24:55.452
I get that. We all do things
we don't want to do for a while,

24:55.454 --> 24:57.786
so we can do the things that
we really want to do.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.455
That's why
I audition for commercials.

24:59.656 --> 25:01.920
It's more of a long-term thing.

25:01.922 --> 25:04.852
You know, music is great,
and he's so good at it, but

25:04.854 --> 25:06.485
you can only do this band thing
for so long

25:06.487 --> 25:09.552
before you have to start thinking
about your future, right?

25:09.554 --> 25:10.222
Right.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.489
So. Emily, you're an actress?

25:14.355 --> 25:17.721
No. I'm actually more
of a comedian.

25:17.723 --> 25:18.757
Which basically means

25:20.021 --> 25:20.520
I'm a less attractive
version of an actress.

25:20.522 --> 25:22.155
Oh...

25:23.355 --> 25:24.720
Why would you say that?
You're so beautiful.

25:24.722 --> 25:25.722
So cute.

25:27.289 --> 25:28.157
I'm joking.

25:29.023 --> 25:30.220
Yeah, but even if you're joking,

25:30.222 --> 25:33.223
it's not healthy
to talk about yourself that way.

25:33.423 --> 25:34.955
So, Emily, you do stand-up?

25:34.957 --> 25:37.253
No, I don't do stand up comedy.

25:37.255 --> 25:40.123
It's hard to explain what I
do...

25:41.424 --> 25:42.523
It's stupid.

25:43.524 --> 25:44.221
It's pretty dumb.

25:44.223 --> 25:46.290
Emily is so funny.

25:46.756 --> 25:49.255
You have over 50,000
YouTube subscribers, right?

25:49.257 --> 25:50.422
Wow!

25:50.424 --> 25:51.588
Really? Wow!

25:51.590 --> 25:52.955
You can really do something
with that.

25:52.957 --> 25:54.289
I was just reading this article

25:54.291 --> 25:56.888
about a girl who was doing
make-up tutorials online,

25:56.890 --> 25:58.821
and she accidentally
got make-up in her eye,

25:58.823 --> 26:00.423
and she had this major
freak-out.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.755
It was so real and so funny.

26:01.757 --> 26:04.256
So the video goes viral,

26:04.258 --> 26:05.890
and then she goes
on the "Today" show,

26:05.892 --> 26:07.255
and based on its success,

26:07.257 --> 26:10.323
she was able to launch her own
beauty tutorial channel,

26:10.325 --> 26:13.591
and she just came out
with this big make-up line.

26:13.593 --> 26:15.890
Have you ever thought of
doing something like that?

26:15.892 --> 26:17.723
No, I haven't.

26:17.725 --> 26:18.793
Why not?

26:21.458 --> 26:23.757
Oh, what about you, Celeste?

26:23.759 --> 26:25.524
I never found out
what you do for a living.

26:25.526 --> 26:27.226
Celeste is an entrepreneur.

26:27.492 --> 26:28.493
Okay.

26:28.825 --> 26:30.223
What's that mean?

26:30.225 --> 26:33.326
Just a fancy French word.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.991
I worked for a social media
firm when I was 25 and...

26:37.993 --> 26:40.991
I realized their client model
wasn't sustainable cause

26:40.993 --> 26:43.225
it was fractured
across too many platforms,

26:43.227 --> 26:44.260
so I quit,

26:45.726 --> 26:47.558
and I took my savings and teamed
up with a fellow Penn grad,

26:47.560 --> 26:48.790
and we developed coding that

26:48.792 --> 26:51.424
integrates business's
various online presences

26:51.426 --> 26:53.325
into one streamlined platform.

26:53.327 --> 26:56.257
It's still in product
development right now but...

26:56.259 --> 26:58.393
There's been a lot of interest.

26:58.593 --> 26:59.426
Don't be humble.

27:00.593 --> 27:03.325
And she also makes
her own greeting cards.

27:03.327 --> 27:04.392
I sent one to my grandma.

27:04.394 --> 27:05.426
- You did not, really?.
- Yeah.

27:05.428 --> 27:07.525
You know they have them
in six stores?

27:07.527 --> 27:08.359
What?

27:08.361 --> 27:09.857
Yeah. That's our Celeste.

27:09.859 --> 27:10.762
Wow!

27:11.961 --> 27:13.828
It's amazing
how much bread you can eat.

27:14.294 --> 27:16.526
They're not charging
for it, are they?

27:16.528 --> 27:19.358
No, it's not that, it's just
I'm so gluten intolerant...

27:19.360 --> 27:21.660
Even a bite can
throw off my diet for a week.

27:21.662 --> 27:23.559
Yeah,
Celeste got me off bread too

27:23.561 --> 27:25.626
and I feel so much better.

27:25.628 --> 27:28.827
I thought I was gonna miss it,
but I don't.

27:28.829 --> 27:30.862
Well, I for one love bread.

27:31.061 --> 27:32.692
Call me old-fashioned, okay?

27:32.694 --> 27:33.729
I'm jealous.

27:34.894 --> 27:36.126
So, Emily,
I'm just a little confused.

27:36.128 --> 27:38.627
If you don't want to be making
internet videos,

27:38.629 --> 27:40.760
and you don't want to be
a standup comic and

27:40.762 --> 27:41.961
you're not an actress...

27:41.963 --> 27:44.130
What do you want to do?

27:44.628 --> 27:46.893
Why move to Los Angeles
in the first place?

27:46.895 --> 27:47.763
Celeste...

27:48.829 --> 27:51.360
That's a really
good question, Celeste.

27:51.362 --> 27:53.795
And the answer is...

27:54.262 --> 27:55.297
I don't know.

27:56.630 --> 27:58.298
I guess it was pretty
fucking stupid of me, huh?

28:02.663 --> 28:05.131
Well, for a comedian,
she's awfully serious.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.595
Shit!

28:13.597 --> 28:15.629
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

28:15.631 --> 28:16.927
No, no, leave it.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.361
Woah, what happened?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.794
Ouch!

28:19.796 --> 28:20.896
- Oh my God, are you okay?
- I'm fine. Leave me alone!

28:20.898 --> 28:21.762
What the f, Jen!

28:21.764 --> 28:24.229
Suck a dick, Dustin, she's hurt.

28:24.231 --> 28:25.528
Come on, I got you.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.264
Wait, Em...

28:27.030 --> 28:28.131
It's okay. I got her.

28:29.564 --> 28:30.464
Okay.

28:31.264 --> 28:32.764
She has a hot mouth.

28:35.331 --> 28:36.229
Hey, let me see it.

28:36.231 --> 28:37.199
I'm so sorry.

28:38.532 --> 28:39.763
I don't know how I'm going
to pay for all that food.

28:39.765 --> 28:41.395
Fuck that food.
Who cares about that food?

28:41.397 --> 28:42.398
Let me see your hand.

28:51.432 --> 28:52.366
Hey...

28:52.732 --> 28:53.766
Are you Emily Martin?

28:55.499 --> 28:56.766
- Yeah?
- Dude!

28:57.466 --> 28:58.467
Jen!

28:58.966 --> 28:59.732
Jen Morales.

29:01.132 --> 29:03.963
We talked for a second
at the party on the East side.

29:03.965 --> 29:05.265
You were with Ravi.

29:06.765 --> 29:09.167
There was that band of girls
that hits pots as instruments.

29:09.366 --> 29:11.334
Ahhh, Manic Pixie Jihad.

29:11.567 --> 29:12.730
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

29:12.732 --> 29:15.997
Dude! Is it weird that
I feel like I know you?

29:15.999 --> 29:18.465
People post your vids
all the time.

29:18.467 --> 29:19.501
- They do?
- Yeah.

29:20.899 --> 29:23.498
My mom's favorite one is
that one of you in the bathtub.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.898
Hey, you're based out of LA?
What are you doing out here?

29:25.900 --> 29:27.102
My cat died.

29:27.302 --> 29:28.634
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:28.934 --> 29:29.868
Was he old?

29:30.068 --> 29:31.434
No, he wasn't.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.931
Oh man...

29:32.933 --> 29:34.598
That guy up there
your boyfriend?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.266
That's my ex-boyfriend.

29:36.534 --> 29:37.498
Oh.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.798
I left my cat with him.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.965
But he wasn't my ex-boyfriend
when I did that.

29:40.967 --> 29:44.167
He was my boyfriend,
and then I moved to Los Angeles.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.632
And we tried long distance,
and then I broke up with him.

29:47.634 --> 29:49.866
But don't worry about him
because he has a new girlfriend

29:49.868 --> 29:51.232
and she's super-cool.

29:51.234 --> 29:53.433
And she lives in our house

29:53.435 --> 29:55.498
that's theirs,
and she ripped up the carpet,

29:55.500 --> 29:56.999
and it looks really pretty.

29:57.001 --> 30:01.000
And she says that
it's her cat too!

30:01.002 --> 30:03.169
And I think that that's fair.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.769
It's okay, it's okay.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.700
I'm sorry, I can't breathe.

30:06.702 --> 30:08.399
- It's okay...
- I'm sorry.

30:08.401 --> 30:09.136
Hold that thought.

30:09.901 --> 30:11.202
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:23.435 --> 30:25.667
I'm sorry.
I don't want to drink.

30:25.669 --> 30:27.435
It's okay,
just tell me what happened.

30:27.437 --> 30:28.435
I already said it.

30:28.437 --> 30:29.368
Say it again.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.205
Which part?

30:30.403 --> 30:31.437
Any of it.

30:32.837 --> 30:33.671
Okay.

30:34.837 --> 30:37.501
I just had all these plans
and these goals.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.100
Right.

30:39.102 --> 30:40.334
And I thought if I did one thing,
then I did another thing...

30:40.336 --> 30:44.969
And this and
that was supposed to happen...

30:44.971 --> 30:45.838
How do you feel?

30:48.903 --> 30:49.601
I don't know.

30:49.603 --> 30:50.435
Exactly.

30:50.437 --> 30:51.070
What?

30:51.072 --> 30:52.603
Just breathe.

30:52.605 --> 30:54.568
How am I supposed to breathe?
You just threw water in my...

30:54.570 --> 30:56.537
Oh my God!

31:06.705 --> 31:08.138
You feel better?

31:10.238 --> 31:10.839
I feel great.

31:31.504 --> 31:33.269
Do you mind passing the butter?

31:33.271 --> 31:34.307
Sure, here.

31:35.306 --> 31:36.474
Thank you.

31:40.672 --> 31:42.773
I'm sorry about your dress.

31:43.838 --> 31:46.339
I can pay
to have it dry-cleaned.

32:28.008 --> 32:31.641
MEOW
It's Jen. see you manana...

32:53.542 --> 32:54.742
Emily?

32:56.010 --> 32:57.709
Emily?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.277
Emily?

33:02.775 --> 33:03.310
Emily?

33:05.277 --> 33:06.244
Did I wake you?

33:07.377 --> 33:08.110
Yes.

33:09.210 --> 33:10.744
I wanted to share some good
news.

33:11.610 --> 33:12.478
Okay?

33:13.845 --> 33:16.241
We were able to get
a flight voucher in your name

33:16.243 --> 33:18.677
because my cousin's a manager
at Delta.

33:19.245 --> 33:20.142
What?

33:20.144 --> 33:22.443
I heard you were worried about

33:22.445 --> 33:24.112
returning to Los Angeles?

33:25.777 --> 33:27.845
You got me a plane ticket?

33:28.410 --> 33:29.610
Un-huh.

33:29.612 --> 33:32.544
It's just coach. We used miles.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.544
- You didn't have to do that.
- I know.

33:36.644 --> 33:37.878
But I wanted to.

33:40.678 --> 33:42.310
My apologies for waking you up.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.545
I just wanted to share the good
news before I went to work.

33:46.311 --> 33:48.613
Have a really beautiful day,
Emily.

34:10.478 --> 34:11.447
Eric?

34:12.846 --> 34:14.146
Celeste?

34:50.715 --> 34:52.547
I'm sorry! I was just
looking for the toothpaste.

34:52.914 --> 34:53.514
It's okay!

34:54.148 --> 34:54.716
It's alright.

34:55.581 --> 34:57.183
Nothing you haven't seen before.

34:58.581 --> 35:00.715
Yeah, that's very true.

35:01.315 --> 35:03.012
Toothpaste is
in the second cabinet

35:03.014 --> 35:04.716
to the right in the bathroom.

35:04.983 --> 35:05.849
Thank you.

35:06.515 --> 35:07.650
Hey, Em?

35:08.881 --> 35:10.282
Have you had breakfast?

35:22.850 --> 35:24.815
I'm surprised you kept the
table.

35:24.817 --> 35:26.914
Celeste, she refinished it.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.551
She's really, really handy.

35:29.350 --> 35:30.948
Oh, Celeste...

35:30.950 --> 35:33.485
Celeste really is the best, huh?

35:34.550 --> 35:35.981
I'm glad
to hear you say that.

35:35.983 --> 35:37.847
Because I was worried
after last night.

35:37.849 --> 35:39.318
You were worried?

35:39.517 --> 35:40.749
Worried about me?

35:40.751 --> 35:43.681
How come? You know me.
New day. New Emily.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.484
Yeah, I do. I know you.

35:49.884 --> 35:52.318
You want me to help?
You want me to make some coffee?

35:53.684 --> 35:54.819
Yeah, that'd be great.

35:55.316 --> 35:56.118
Cool.

36:02.518 --> 36:04.282
I'm sorry, I just need...

36:04.284 --> 36:06.416
Oh yeah. No, sorry.

36:06.418 --> 36:07.352
You're okay.

36:40.254 --> 36:42.687
You know
I like it strong, right?

36:43.620 --> 36:45.187
I'll make it strong.

37:09.822 --> 37:11.885
Yeah, you know what?
We're actually off coffee now.

37:11.887 --> 37:13.918
And I know it sounds crazy but

37:13.920 --> 37:15.188
I have more energy.

37:29.755 --> 37:30.954
I have to head to school.

37:30.956 --> 37:34.257
Are you gonna be okay here
alone all day?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.756
Yeah, I think so.
I still have a key.

37:36.990 --> 37:38.723
Great.
And I can take that back later.

37:39.589 --> 37:40.355
Of course.

37:41.522 --> 37:43.386
Oh, also we moved
a ton of your stuff

37:43.388 --> 37:45.687
in boxes out into the shed.

37:45.689 --> 37:47.287
Maybe you want to go through it,

37:47.289 --> 37:49.021
and take some stuff
back with you?

37:49.023 --> 37:52.021
And your bike.
We both have bikes so...

37:52.023 --> 37:54.788
Maybe you want to figure out
what you want to do with that.

37:54.790 --> 37:57.190
Maybe sell it for money?

37:58.724 --> 38:01.357
Sure, yeah. Really good idea.
Thank you.

38:01.957 --> 38:02.724
Great.

38:04.990 --> 38:05.891
Toodles.

38:07.591 --> 38:08.325
Toodles.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.127
Jesus, fucking Christ...

39:47.928 --> 39:48.828
Crap.

40:05.996 --> 40:09.362
<i>It's Jen. See you manana?</i>

40:29.997 --> 40:31.631
Hi, is Jen home?

40:41.664 --> 40:43.262
Hey, Dude!

40:43.264 --> 40:44.698
- Hey.
- What up?

40:45.997 --> 40:47.396
Hey.

40:47.398 --> 40:48.728
Happy you found me!

40:48.730 --> 40:49.630
Come on in.

40:49.632 --> 40:50.961
It's where the magic happens.

40:50.963 --> 40:52.496
How many people live here?

40:52.498 --> 40:54.496
- Like four to six.
- Really?

40:54.498 --> 40:57.328
Yeah, sometimes
we AirBnB the couch.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.328
Dude, it's so f'd that
you're staying

40:59.330 --> 41:01.596
with your ex-boyfriend
and his new girlfriend.

41:01.598 --> 41:02.299
I know.

41:03.666 --> 41:05.829
What twisted mind would agree
to something like that?

41:05.831 --> 41:08.630
So what are we dealing with?
A jealous psycho-bitch?

41:08.632 --> 41:12.363
No, Celeste is not the type of
girl that gets jealous.

41:12.365 --> 41:16.234
In fact,
she is super, super nice,

41:16.466 --> 41:19.265
and put together, and everything
in her life is beautiful,

41:19.267 --> 41:20.564
and nothing's out of place.

41:20.566 --> 41:23.298
You know, like a
Pinterest board come to life.

41:23.599 --> 41:25.030
Oh, so she's super-fake.

41:25.032 --> 41:27.364
And she has him
on anti-depressants.

41:27.366 --> 41:28.831
She literally has him drugged
up.

41:28.833 --> 41:29.965
Are you fucking serious?

41:29.967 --> 41:31.697
I saw them in their cabinet...

41:31.699 --> 41:33.231
which used to be my cabinet.

41:33.233 --> 41:37.300
It's like they've gotten rid of
every trace that I ever existed.

41:38.532 --> 41:41.299
They put all my stuff
in the shed...

41:41.567 --> 41:44.464
My entire life in Austin,
packed up in two boxes.

41:44.466 --> 41:47.031
Eric said, "You have to
get these out of here."

41:47.033 --> 41:49.332
But what am I supposed to do?
I can't take them to LA with me,

41:49.334 --> 41:51.298
I don't have any space,
I live in a studio.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.765
Why not keep your stuff here,

41:52.767 --> 41:54.599
I'd be happy to hold it for you.

41:54.601 --> 41:55.599
Really?

41:55.601 --> 41:57.565
You barely even know me.

41:57.567 --> 41:59.334
Nobody knows anyone.

41:59.534 --> 42:01.568
Do you even know yourself?

42:01.834 --> 42:03.733
I dunno, I think so.

42:03.735 --> 42:05.167
I look in the mirror a lot.

42:05.867 --> 42:07.466
Well, Emily Martin,

42:07.468 --> 42:08.833
to truly know oneself,

42:08.835 --> 42:11.267
you have to ask yourself
one thing...

42:11.269 --> 42:13.236
And what's that?

42:16.002 --> 42:18.469
Are you willing to be reborn?

42:27.336 --> 42:28.136
Jen!

42:28.935 --> 42:31.436
- Hey, ladies!
- What up?

42:32.536 --> 42:34.302
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:35.303 --> 42:35.736
Art!

42:38.869 --> 42:40.770
Pass that pipe...

42:42.303 --> 42:42.804
Here.

42:44.136 --> 42:45.570
It's so nice to be back
in the Greenbelt, it feels like

42:47.068 --> 42:47.769
it's the only thing in Austin
that hasn't really changed.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.567
Seriously, all the tech douches
coming in, buying property,

42:51.569 --> 42:53.204
building condos on everything.

42:54.669 --> 42:55.770
They're tearin' it all down,
that's all they know how to do.

42:57.070 --> 42:57.800
A normal person
can't afford anything anymore.

42:57.802 --> 42:59.967
I had to move past 183.

42:59.969 --> 43:01.301
I had to move back in
with my parents.

43:01.303 --> 43:03.704
And they had to move back in
with their parents.

43:06.738 --> 43:07.704
You want?

43:08.037 --> 43:10.303
Oh no, I'm good, thank you.

43:13.436 --> 43:15.434
Dude, that bikini top
looks sick on you.

43:15.436 --> 43:15.837
Thanks.

43:56.939 --> 43:59.206
She looks like
she's seen a titty ghost.

44:02.740 --> 44:04.840
I'm sorry, I...

44:05.340 --> 44:06.739
You know it's legal here
in Austin.

44:06.741 --> 44:08.708
It's all right.
Calm down.

44:08.974 --> 44:09.774
I know that.

44:10.639 --> 44:12.006
Come on, free your nipples.

44:12.008 --> 44:13.708
- Shut up!
- Come on, dude.

44:13.940 --> 44:15.272
Don't say that.

44:15.274 --> 44:16.374
What? Girls say it.

44:17.541 --> 44:18.705
Yeah, but it's liberating
when we say it.

44:18.707 --> 44:21.438
And it's creepy as fuck
when guys say it.

44:21.440 --> 44:25.342
Guys, man.
Take it easy, her cat just died.

44:25.874 --> 44:27.509
Oh, no.

44:27.975 --> 44:29.375
I'm sorry.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.575
No, it's not that, I'm...

44:55.341 --> 44:56.242
Alright!

44:58.843 --> 45:00.540
Well, I'm gonna jump in.

45:00.542 --> 45:01.408
Yeah.

45:01.410 --> 45:02.375
Here we go.

45:03.009 --> 45:03.742
Ready?

45:05.008 --> 45:06.773
Oh, no, I'm just gonna
warm up for a little bit.

45:06.775 --> 45:07.809
Alright.

45:27.744 --> 45:28.477
Hey...

45:29.343 --> 45:30.242
If you take a hit of this...

45:30.244 --> 45:32.342
You can put your top back on.

45:32.344 --> 45:32.877
Deal.

45:36.643 --> 45:38.408
- Look that way.
- Okay.

45:38.410 --> 45:41.710
Let me know when your boobs
are safely quarantined.

45:43.378 --> 45:44.445
Okay.

45:44.645 --> 45:45.645
Thanks.

45:54.478 --> 45:56.944
I don't normally smoke.
It makes me tired.

45:56.946 --> 45:58.876
And I don't understand
what funny is.

45:58.878 --> 46:00.279
What is there to understand?

46:03.379 --> 46:04.610
So...

46:04.612 --> 46:05.712
Art...

46:06.678 --> 46:08.776
Is Art short for Arthur?

46:08.778 --> 46:11.443
No, it's short
for Artist, actually.

46:11.445 --> 46:12.547
Really?

46:13.746 --> 46:15.313
My parents had
pretty high expectations.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.677
Oh, well, my name's Emily.

46:17.679 --> 46:20.310
My parents had
very, very low expectations.

46:20.312 --> 46:21.777
They must be pretty hyped,

46:21.779 --> 46:23.348
you turned out pretty creative.

46:23.879 --> 46:25.412
What makes you say that?

46:26.279 --> 46:28.877
You have the whole
quirky girl vibe going.

46:28.879 --> 46:30.248
Oh, Jesus!

46:31.379 --> 46:32.211
- What?
- That is so condescending.

46:32.213 --> 46:33.546
It's not condescending...

46:33.548 --> 46:35.744
Saying you're quirky
means saying you're interesting.

46:35.746 --> 46:36.579
It's a compliment.

46:37.913 --> 46:39.280
No, it's not because
you would never call a guy that.

46:40.648 --> 46:41.548
With a guy you'd use
another word like "eccentric,"

46:43.080 --> 46:44.379
but with a girl, you need a word
that recognizes her uniqueness,

46:44.381 --> 46:47.112
but at the same time
devalues her intelligence.

46:47.114 --> 46:49.711
Like "her delightful whimsy could
never make a cogentargument,"

46:49.713 --> 46:51.878
highlighting
your unconscious sexism.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.711
Well, you're not quirky,

46:53.713 --> 46:56.448
but you're definitely
kind of a bitch.

46:56.880 --> 46:57.747
Thank you.

46:58.381 --> 46:59.482
You're welcome.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.282
- Oh no.
- Sorry.

47:09.381 --> 47:10.182
Thank you.

47:13.649 --> 47:14.516
Alright.

47:14.782 --> 47:16.412
Oh shit, it's my work.

47:16.414 --> 47:18.313
Don't answer it. Hang it up.

47:18.315 --> 47:19.480
Hit reject.

47:19.482 --> 47:20.150
What?

47:21.449 --> 47:21.883
They said it would take
a few days to cremate him,

47:22.982 --> 47:23.048
so I'll probably be here
over the weekend,

47:24.649 --> 47:24.716
but I have my laptop, and can
do all my work from here.

47:25.683 --> 47:25.750
<i>Emily, let's be real.</i>

47:28.082 --> 47:29.315
This isjust not
a priority for you.

47:30.816 --> 47:30.883
<i>Wait.
What are you talking about?</i>

47:31.747 --> 47:32.516
Do you think I planned this?

47:34.250 --> 47:37.582
Listen, I have all the assets, I can
just upload the cuts to Dropbox.

47:37.816 --> 47:40.813
Yeah, sounds like you're working
really really hard over there.

47:40.815 --> 47:42.079
<i>Let's face it, Emily.</i>

47:42.081 --> 47:43.846
You're just not
a right fit with us anymore.

47:43.848 --> 47:47.350
Okay, if this is about the auditions,
I can stop going for a few weeks.

47:47.549 --> 47:48.849
I really need the job.

47:48.851 --> 47:51.814
Hey Todd, my cat died!

47:51.816 --> 47:53.547
I needed to be here for him.

47:53.549 --> 47:54.948
<i>Come on, Emily.</i>

47:54.950 --> 47:56.784
It's just a fucking cat.

47:59.583 --> 48:01.882
"It's just a fucking cat"?

48:01.884 --> 48:02.948
You know what?

48:02.950 --> 48:03.717
Fuck you!

48:04.018 --> 48:04.750
Fuck you!

48:05.484 --> 48:07.151
<i>Fuck Pharmtech!</i>

48:07.351 --> 48:09.715
And fuck the man! I quit!

48:13.817 --> 48:14.652
I quit!

48:17.651 --> 48:18.783
Wooo!

49:37.587 --> 49:39.053
Hey, is this your phone?

49:39.055 --> 49:40.922
I found it in the bushes.

49:41.388 --> 49:43.355
- Yeah, thanks.
- Sure.

49:44.822 --> 49:46.919
<i>This message is for Emily
Martin.</i>

49:46.921 --> 49:50.555
<i>We're calling to let you know that Mr.
Roosevelt is ready.</i>

49:50.821 --> 49:52.656
Oh God... Jen?

49:58.922 --> 50:00.753
Hey, do you want
my roommate to drive you?

50:00.755 --> 50:01.886
No, it's okay.

50:01.888 --> 50:03.855
- Bye!
- Bye!

50:20.491 --> 50:22.790
Hello.

50:22.990 --> 50:24.292
I'm here to pick up my cat.

50:25.591 --> 50:27.725
Okay. What procedure
did you drop him off for?

50:27.923 --> 50:30.524
Oh no, I'm sorry,
I'm here to pick up my dead cat.

50:30.791 --> 50:32.023
Mr. Roosevelt?

50:32.025 --> 50:33.158
Oh...

50:34.291 --> 50:36.191
I'm sorry,
Mr. Roosevelt is not here.

50:36.690 --> 50:38.355
What do you mean he's not here?

50:38.357 --> 50:40.288
Someone already picked him up.

50:40.290 --> 50:42.956
Wait, you just let some stranger
take my cat's ashes home?

50:42.958 --> 50:45.455
Don't you check people's IDs
or something?

50:45.457 --> 50:46.292
Who was it?

50:46.759 --> 50:48.223
It was a woman...

50:48.225 --> 50:51.591
She bought a different urn.
It should be on the invoice.

50:53.792 --> 50:55.858
- Celeste Jones.
- Celeste Jones.

51:07.992 --> 51:09.056
Eric!

51:09.058 --> 51:09.892
Celeste!

51:41.061 --> 51:43.561
- Lean forward, push your back up.
- I'm gonna lean you back...

51:47.428 --> 51:48.326
Oh, Emily.

51:48.826 --> 51:50.394
Emily's home.

51:51.494 --> 51:53.528
Why did you pick up
Mr. Roosevelt?

51:54.761 --> 51:55.528
Pardon me?

51:56.428 --> 51:57.795
Why did you pick up the ashes?

51:58.560 --> 52:00.393
They called me.

52:00.395 --> 52:02.829
Why did they call you?

52:04.494 --> 52:07.026
Well, I called to check in
this morning.

52:07.028 --> 52:10.761
And later today they said
they tried calling you but

52:10.763 --> 52:12.828
couldn't get ahold of you.

52:13.729 --> 52:14.929
And what about the urn?

52:15.428 --> 52:17.359
Oh, yeah...

52:17.361 --> 52:18.994
You should have seen what
they put him in.

52:18.996 --> 52:21.196
It looked like it was
the cheapest one they had.

52:21.395 --> 52:23.362
It was the second cheapest.

52:26.529 --> 52:28.860
I guess that's it. We have
him back. Time to bury him.

52:28.862 --> 52:29.730
Do you have a shovel?

52:31.063 --> 52:31.430
Or do you want to
just put him in your compost?

52:35.361 --> 52:36.163
What?

52:37.264 --> 52:38.264
Celeste and I thought
it might be nice

52:39.497 --> 52:40.526
to have some friends
come over tomorrow...

52:40.528 --> 52:43.530
during the day
and pay their respects.

52:43.731 --> 52:47.531
Just a small gathering
tomorrow early after breakfast.

52:48.031 --> 52:49.395
Like a brunch?

52:49.397 --> 52:50.565
Yes! Exactly.

52:51.764 --> 52:52.496
A few of my friends
are bringing some dishes

52:52.498 --> 52:54.460
and there'll be mimosas.

52:54.462 --> 52:56.631
Oh mimosas...

52:56.997 --> 52:59.727
But don't worry, you don't have
to bring anything. Just yourself.

52:59.729 --> 53:01.164
And your memories.

53:15.730 --> 53:16.899
Here...

53:27.865 --> 53:29.499
I'll keep him safe.

54:18.967 --> 54:19.768
Eric!

54:21.335 --> 54:22.998
Hey, where's Celeste?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.031
She left for book club.

54:24.033 --> 54:27.501
Jesus, Eric! Book club?
Seriously?

54:27.702 --> 54:29.399
- Okay, what's going on?
- Celeste!

54:29.401 --> 54:30.698
How could you let her
do this to me?

54:30.700 --> 54:31.601
Do what?

54:32.802 --> 54:34.099
Em, Celeste has been
nothing but nice to you.

54:34.101 --> 54:36.032
No, I know that's
what she's making it seem like,

54:36.034 --> 54:37.632
but she's trying
to make me look bad.

54:37.634 --> 54:38.633
Calm down!

54:38.635 --> 54:38.903
What?

54:39.736 --> 54:40.634
This is not about Celeste.

54:40.636 --> 54:42.866
Of course it's about Celeste.

54:42.868 --> 54:45.569
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is!

54:46.401 --> 54:49.269
<i>No, it's not.</i>

54:49.569 --> 54:50.403
Don't.

54:50.736 --> 54:52.236
Don't do this.

54:53.668 --> 54:55.833
<i>It's about us...</i>

54:55.835 --> 54:57.669
Come on, give it to me.

55:00.070 --> 55:01.571
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

55:02.969 --> 55:04.467
<i>But what do we do?</i>

55:04.469 --> 55:06.935
<i>I don't know</i>

55:06.937 --> 55:08.571
<i>but can we just talk?</i>

55:22.771 --> 55:23.637
Do you remember

55:25.138 --> 55:26.804
how we were gonna improvise a
whole album based on our fights?

55:27.004 --> 55:28.170
Yeah.

55:32.370 --> 55:34.870
<i>Why didn't that happen?</i>

55:34.872 --> 55:36.703
<i>Because you left.</i>

55:36.705 --> 55:37.772
No...

55:38.039 --> 55:39.669
You should play this.

55:39.671 --> 55:41.002
Is your guitar in the shed?

55:41.004 --> 55:42.469
No, Em what? No.

55:42.471 --> 55:43.705
Play it! No.

55:44.304 --> 55:45.838
This is gonna be great.

56:01.739 --> 56:02.740
You were saying...

56:04.072 --> 56:04.938
<i>Because I...</i>

56:05.972 --> 56:06.939
I'll tune it.

56:08.072 --> 56:09.207
What are you doing?

56:13.638 --> 56:16.370
What do you mean? I thought
we were both doing this.

56:16.372 --> 56:17.574
I'm sorry.

56:19.307 --> 56:21.338
Let's just get out of here.

56:22.507 --> 56:24.840
- You have to try this one.
- Oh yeah?

56:27.640 --> 56:28.507
Fuck!

56:29.373 --> 56:31.174
- Oh, my God.
- It's so hot.

56:31.572 --> 56:33.907
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It is so hot!

56:37.540 --> 56:39.071
Damn, damn!

56:39.073 --> 56:39.972
Good though.

56:39.974 --> 56:42.374
I missed tacos.

56:43.507 --> 56:46.208
Your siblings in LA
do not compare.

56:46.940 --> 56:47.842
What? Really?

56:48.942 --> 56:51.040
I thought LA had
the best Mexican food.

56:51.042 --> 56:52.739
No. That's a myth.

56:52.741 --> 56:54.309
It's really awful.

56:55.674 --> 56:57.906
I think it's because
LA is obsessed with burritos.

56:57.908 --> 56:58.874
Who needs those?

57:00.040 --> 57:00.738
Burritos are just
sleeping bags for rice.

57:00.740 --> 57:02.507
I want the flavor.

57:03.609 --> 57:04.507
Can I try that one?

57:04.509 --> 57:05.376
Yeah.

57:05.000 --> 57:25.000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

57:05.807 --> 57:06.576
It's mild.

57:07.874 --> 57:10.208
I'm a pussy and it feels good
to say out loud.

57:11.475 --> 57:12.576
So...

57:13.675 --> 57:15.006
How's that going?

57:15.008 --> 57:16.642
- You mean LA?
- Yeah.

57:17.743 --> 57:19.210
I'm managing.

57:20.676 --> 57:23.876
How's real estate-ing going?

57:24.376 --> 57:26.473
It's more hypothetical than
real...

57:26.475 --> 57:27.541
so far but...

57:27.543 --> 57:28.773
It's good,
I'm taking courses and

57:28.775 --> 57:32.476
I'm shadowing this guy
that Celeste knows.

57:32.942 --> 57:33.808
It's good.

57:38.877 --> 57:39.375
Em?

57:43.044 --> 57:44.243
I missed you.

57:47.742 --> 57:48.811
Dude!

57:49.377 --> 57:50.675
Emily Martin?

57:50.677 --> 57:51.777
Shut up!

57:52.044 --> 57:53.775
Stacy, hi.

57:53.777 --> 57:57.776
Sean, I literally was just talking
about Emily, my college roommate.

57:57.778 --> 58:00.509
God, what are you doing here?
You're like famous.

58:00.511 --> 58:03.609
She did that spaghetti bath
video I was telling you about.

58:03.611 --> 58:05.408
It has like 10 million views.

58:05.410 --> 58:07.378
You must have made so much
money.

58:07.612 --> 58:09.610
Yeah... no.

58:09.612 --> 58:10.742
I couldn't monetize it.

58:10.744 --> 58:11.876
What the fuck? Why?

58:11.878 --> 58:13.976
Because of
the Michael Jackson song.

58:13.978 --> 58:15.778
Fuck! Fuck that guy.

58:16.577 --> 58:18.811
So, what are you two doing?

58:19.012 --> 58:21.646
- We are just eating tacos.
- Tacos.

58:21.978 --> 58:25.512
Hey, Sean and I are going to
this house party up the street.

58:25.745 --> 58:29.379
You guys should come.
There's gonna be beers and fun.

58:29.612 --> 58:32.310
No, we were kind of
in the middle of something.

58:32.312 --> 58:32.946
I'd do it.

58:34.278 --> 58:36.642
Yeah, he's doing it.
Come on, you should go. Come on!

58:36.644 --> 58:37.179
Please!

58:43.313 --> 58:45.280
BRB, PBR!

58:48.080 --> 58:49.347
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

58:49.578 --> 58:52.214
Oooh! I can't seem to lose you!

58:52.412 --> 58:53.313
Oh my God.

58:54.380 --> 58:55.414
- Oh my God.
- Em, how you doing?

58:56.980 --> 58:57.610
- Jen, what are you doing here?
- I didn't mean to scare you.

58:57.612 --> 58:58.780
No, it's okay.

58:59.980 --> 59:00.045
It's my friend's house.
We're about to play.

59:00.613 --> 59:00.679
Oh, cool.

59:01.714 --> 59:02.813
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good.

59:03.880 --> 59:04.448
- How it is going, bro?
- Good.

59:05.214 --> 59:05.711
Alright, see you guys.

59:05.713 --> 59:06.447
Yeah.

59:08.413 --> 59:09.314
How do I know her?

59:10.781 --> 59:13.544
She's the waitress I ran into
at the French restaurant.

59:13.546 --> 59:15.545
- And just now.
- Yeah.

59:15.547 --> 59:16.578
Again.

59:18.415 --> 59:20.248
We're the Leeks.

59:51.350 --> 59:52.917
Oh my God!

59:53.548 --> 59:54.915
You were so amazing!

59:54.917 --> 59:55.750
Oh, thanks man.

59:56.949 --> 59:58.680
Wait. Why didn't tell me
that you were in a band?

59:58.682 --> 01:00:00.780
- Well, you never asked.
- Oh.

01:00:00.782 --> 01:00:02.581
- You want a cigarette?
- No, I'm good.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:03.384
Okay.

01:00:04.449 --> 01:00:05.949
What the hell,
gimme a cigarette.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.082
- Yeah, you want one too?
- You know what, I'll take one.

01:00:08.084 --> 01:00:08.851
Yeah. Why not?

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:11.650
We're all doing it.
I love peer pressure.

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.947
Yeah, you know,
I was just like, "Fuck guys."

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:26.115
And then I got on Tinder.

01:00:26.117 --> 01:00:28.716
And then I met Sean
three days ago...

01:00:28.718 --> 01:00:30.685
It's been fucking amazing.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:39.618
Wait...

01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:42.348
Do you see celebrities
all the time in LA?

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:44.816
Well, one New Year's Eve,

01:00:44.818 --> 01:00:47.648
I saw Thom York buying
deodorant at a Ralph's.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.652
Wait, what's a Ralph's?

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:54.419
It's a HEB, but it's like HEB.

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.618
But why is it called Ralph's?

01:01:09.519 --> 01:01:10.585
Hey everybody!

01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:12.618
Who wants to see
a really funny video

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.451
with the most famous person
from Austin Texas?

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:14.786
No.

01:01:15.752 --> 01:01:16.384
My friend
Emily Martin right here.

01:01:16.386 --> 01:01:17.187
No, please...

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.754
- Play it.
- Come on, play it!

01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:21.951
I think
it's like "spaghetti balls"?

01:01:21.953 --> 01:01:23.852
Uhh, "meatballs"?

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.017
Uhh... "tub girl"!

01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:25.754
Definitely not "tub girl".

01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:28.754
I can't hear anything!

01:01:29.255 --> 01:01:30.421
Ohhhh!

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.920
Ohhhh!

01:01:51.588 --> 01:01:53.488
OOhhhh!

01:01:53.888 --> 01:01:56.085
More sauce! More sauce!

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:58.254
More sauce! More sauce!

01:01:58.554 --> 01:02:00.355
More sauce! More sauce!

01:02:00.722 --> 01:02:03.322
More sauce! More sauce! More...!

01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:05.756
- OOHHH!
- YEAH!

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:10.954
More sauce! More sauce!
More sauce!

01:02:10.956 --> 01:02:14.723
More sauce! More sauce!
More sauce!

01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:20.087
Dude, how did you get
so many noodles in that tub?

01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:22.890
Did you smell like
tomatoes for weeks?

01:02:23.357 --> 01:02:25.754
Why are you so bummed out?
People loved it.

01:02:25.756 --> 01:02:28.587
I dunno.
It's really hard to explain.

01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:31.322
Dude, turn that sad clown frown
upside down.

01:02:31.324 --> 01:02:33.823
Is this all
I'm gonna be known for?

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:48.324
<i>You always act
like nothing's wrong.</i>

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:52.558
<i>You always tell me
that you're fine.</i>

01:02:53.724 --> 01:02:56.623
<i>Dark clouds
are falling on your head.</i>

01:02:57.724 --> 01:02:59.824
<i>Just like a sad little clown.</i>

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:06.057
<i>You got to turn
that frown upside down</i>

01:03:06.059 --> 01:03:08.626
<i>My sad little clown.</i>

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.622
<i>You're not fooling me, baby.</i>

01:03:12.624 --> 01:03:17.592
<i>I can see
a sad little clown in misery.</i>

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:22.325
<i>You're my sad little clown.</i>

01:03:23.826 --> 01:03:26.493
<i>You're my sad little clown.</i>

01:03:27.893 --> 01:03:30.725
<i>You're my sad little clown.</i>

01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:35.792
<i>Turn your frown upside down.</i>

01:04:07.061 --> 01:04:09.862
WHOA!

01:04:11.529 --> 01:04:14.059
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Whoa, whoa...

01:04:14.061 --> 01:04:16.262
- Man overboard!
- No!

01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:19.025
- Alright.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:19.027 --> 01:04:20.359
I got you.

01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:21.362
I got you.

01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:23.262
You got me!

01:04:23.695 --> 01:04:24.961
I'm a menace to society.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.391
Wow, you're a fucking bad ass.

01:04:27.393 --> 01:04:28.929
- I'm impressed.
- Yeah.

01:04:29.495 --> 01:04:31.796
Just leave these bikes for dead.

01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:40.396
We shouldn't...

01:04:40.696 --> 01:04:41.563
No.

01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:44.597
...do anything.

01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:09.028
- We can't do this.
- No, I know.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.462
This is not a thing that
we should be doing.

01:05:11.464 --> 01:05:13.494
- We should not be doing this.
- No.

01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:15.094
It's not like...

01:05:15.096 --> 01:05:16.198
No, we can't...

01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:19.566
I know. It's not like
I planned on doing this.

01:05:20.596 --> 01:05:21.798
I have a girlfriend.

01:05:23.098 --> 01:05:24.265
Yeah.

01:05:25.396 --> 01:05:27.231
Well, she's more like
a life coach.

01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:28.929
Come on.

01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:31.329
No, Eric...

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:32.364
You come on.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.232
She's trying to change you.

01:05:37.998 --> 01:05:39.330
She sweeps into your life and thinks
she knows what's best for you,

01:05:39.332 --> 01:05:41.929
and wants to take away the
things you care about?

01:05:41.931 --> 01:05:43.698
For what?
So you can have a "real" job?

01:05:43.964 --> 01:05:46.662
Did you see yourself tonight?
You fucking killed it!

01:05:46.664 --> 01:05:48.730
And you loved it!
And you know you did!

01:05:48.732 --> 01:05:51.933
And you're willing to give
that all up for some girl?

01:05:52.133 --> 01:05:54.363
I've tried the thing.
I've been here for 10 years.

01:05:54.365 --> 01:05:55.466
Nothing has happened.

01:05:56.764 --> 01:05:57.963
Okay. So fucking Austin
isn't working out for you.

01:05:57.965 --> 01:05:59.095
Fuck Austin.

01:05:59.097 --> 01:06:00.430
I always said
you should go on tour.

01:06:00.432 --> 01:06:04.030
And just leave everything
and struggle and be alone.

01:06:04.032 --> 01:06:05.897
So you're alone for a little
bit.

01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:08.497
Sometimes you have to give up
things you care about

01:06:08.499 --> 01:06:10.399
to get the things you want.

01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:13.333
Yeah, and how's
that working out for you.

01:06:15.799 --> 01:06:18.498
Okay, Eric,
I just want to know, I just...

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.399
If you could have anything,
any career, any dream...

01:06:22.401 --> 01:06:25.935
What would it really be? Honestly,
just ask yourself that.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.601
Honestly, I just want a family.

01:06:35.335 --> 01:06:37.468
Is that the Klonopin talking?

01:06:38.567 --> 01:06:39.268
What?

01:06:40.734 --> 01:06:45.367
I saw the prescription drugs
in the cabinet in the bathroom.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:46.869
It's fucking Celeste...

01:06:48.236 --> 01:06:50.932
She has you drugged up so
you'll just do whatever she says

01:06:50.934 --> 01:06:53.733
so you'll just be this perfect
little house husband.

01:06:53.735 --> 01:06:56.865
I'm so fucking sad
for you right now.

01:06:56.867 --> 01:06:58.434
Are you a fucking lunatic?

01:06:58.436 --> 01:06:59.435
What?

01:07:00.536 --> 01:07:01.965
Celeste didn't put me
on Klonopin.

01:07:01.967 --> 01:07:03.467
She helped me get off of it.

01:07:03.469 --> 01:07:05.235
I was on it because of you.

01:07:06.103 --> 01:07:08.670
When you left,
I was a fucking wreck.

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:10.600
I loved you...

01:07:10.602 --> 01:07:12.268
And you disappeared.

01:07:12.636 --> 01:07:13.468
No calls.

01:07:13.936 --> 01:07:15.236
Bye.

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:17.970
Do you know how much that hurt?

01:07:18.703 --> 01:07:21.400
I didn't know I hurt you.

01:07:21.402 --> 01:07:23.866
I didn't know that I hurt you.
You never said that.

01:07:23.868 --> 01:07:25.666
What the fuck did you think
was gonna happen?

01:07:25.668 --> 01:07:26.400
I don't know!

01:07:26.402 --> 01:07:27.734
What did you think?

01:07:27.736 --> 01:07:30.504
I don't know. I didn't know
that you needed me.

01:07:31.537 --> 01:07:33.400
Well, I didn't need you.

01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:34.604
Okay, I didn't...

01:07:36.102 --> 01:07:38.034
Eric... I just... I don't know,
I didn't think it was over.

01:07:38.036 --> 01:07:39.503
You thought I was waiting?

01:07:39.704 --> 01:07:41.204
No, of course
I didn't think that.

01:07:43.504 --> 01:07:45.469
I don't know, I think in some way
I thought I was doing it for you.

01:07:45.471 --> 01:07:48.805
I'm struggling out there.
I'm a miserable person.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.569
Can we be very clear?

01:07:50.571 --> 01:07:52.935
You did not do that for me.

01:07:52.937 --> 01:07:54.638
You did that for you.

01:07:55.537 --> 01:07:57.405
Everything that you do...

01:07:57.771 --> 01:07:59.571
is just for yourself.

01:08:12.538 --> 01:08:13.769
Emily, let's just go home.

01:08:13.771 --> 01:08:15.471
I don't have a home!

01:08:32.839 --> 01:08:34.770
Hey girl!

01:08:34.773 --> 01:08:35.907
FUCK YOU!

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.639
Is that an invitation?

01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:00.470
Oh, sorry,
I don't have any cup holders.

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:01.374
It's okay.

01:09:07.441 --> 01:09:08.242
Do you wanna see my gun?

01:09:08.907 --> 01:09:11.207
- Excuse me?
- I have a gun.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:12.274
Let me show you.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.341
- Like a real gun?
- Yeah.

01:09:15.506 --> 01:09:16.706
- Oh! Whoa...
- It's like an antique.

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:17.241
Okay.

01:09:18.008 --> 01:09:20.443
It's a .45 from 1911.

01:09:20.674 --> 01:09:23.006
It's like literally
over a hundred years old.

01:09:23.009 --> 01:09:25.510
Yeah, that's the math there.

01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:28.939
You want to see the bullets too?

01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:31.738
No, I don't. I'm actually
pretty good. Thank you.

01:09:31.741 --> 01:09:33.872
You can put it away now.

01:09:33.874 --> 01:09:35.006
You don't want to hold it?

01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:36.210
Just hold it.

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:39.310
- I'm okay. I'm fine.
- Okay, it's harmless.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.408
It's not gonna bite you.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.874
It's not. It's gonna shoot me.

01:09:52.743 --> 01:09:55.211
You have like...

01:09:55.411 --> 01:09:57.376
I was gonna say
you've got goose bumps.

01:09:57.378 --> 01:09:57.679
Yeah.

01:09:58.243 --> 01:09:59.877
It's cold.

01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:05.942
Huh...

01:10:05.944 --> 01:10:06.910
Tickles.

01:10:08.443 --> 01:10:09.245
You're funny.

01:10:18.977 --> 01:10:20.278
Say it again!

01:10:20.477 --> 01:10:21.711
You're funny.

01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:29.076
I'll do it...

01:10:29.078 --> 01:10:30.609
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:10:30.611 --> 01:10:32.377
Did you wear braces?

01:10:32.379 --> 01:10:32.612
What?

01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:35.844
Did you ever wear braces?
You have like super nice teeth.

01:10:35.846 --> 01:10:36.479
Shhh.

01:10:39.347 --> 01:10:40.244
Okay, love.

01:10:40.246 --> 01:10:41.813
- I got it.
- So sexy.

01:10:42.846 --> 01:10:43.711
Oh. You okay?

01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:46.546
It's okay. I still have a boner.

01:10:48.546 --> 01:10:49.711
I can't get this thing off.

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.877
It's a bralette.

01:10:51.879 --> 01:10:54.614
It's like a training bra,
but for adults.

01:10:55.845 --> 01:10:57.347
Ah! God!

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:58.880
Oh...

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:02.778
Yeah, I like it...

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.480
Oh!

01:11:04.513 --> 01:11:05.713
- Ah!
- Ah, that felt good...

01:11:06.079 --> 01:11:07.711
That's it.

01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:20.447
Ah, shit.

01:11:21.048 --> 01:11:22.615
Oh, my God.

01:11:38.115 --> 01:11:39.582
Oh...

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:35.952
Hi.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.251
What's the occasion?

01:12:46.017 --> 01:12:47.949
Do you wanna get
some breakfast or something?

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:48.685
No.

01:12:49.584 --> 01:12:50.581
You stepped on my shoe, Dude.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:51.351
Go.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:52.916
We can get brunch somewhere
else.

01:12:52.918 --> 01:12:53.518
No.

01:12:54.284 --> 01:12:54.685
You can't smoke here.

01:12:55.152 --> 01:12:55.718
Go.

01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:57.252
Not on your property.

01:12:58.119 --> 01:12:59.483
Come on smart ass, just go!

01:12:59.485 --> 01:13:01.083
Dude, hey, what the hell!

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.416
Do you want to hang out later?

01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:04.285
- No.
- Alright.

01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:06.816
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, great...

01:13:06.818 --> 01:13:07.719
Well, awesome.

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:10.819
- We did just boop, you know.
- Oh God.

01:13:12.285 --> 01:13:13.550
Alright, well, I'll call you.
I don't have your number!

01:13:13.552 --> 01:13:14.751
I'll google you.

01:13:15.586 --> 01:13:17.917
Alright, well, have fun.

01:13:17.919 --> 01:13:20.954
Save a piece of cat cake for me.

01:13:25.753 --> 01:13:29.851
While we all mourn the loss
of a member of our community,

01:13:29.853 --> 01:13:34.351
it's important to think of this
as a celebration of a life.

01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:37.652
- To Mr. Roosevelt.
- To Mr. Roosevelt.

01:13:39.687 --> 01:13:43.955
And thank you to Melanie
for making this beautiful pie.

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.987
I flew the pecans in
from South Carolina.

01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:50.518
But it's nothing compared
to Bethany's cake.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.553
I just found the picture
on Facebook,

01:13:52.555 --> 01:13:54.388
the cake shop did the rest.

01:13:54.588 --> 01:13:56.385
Very thoughtful, Bethany.
Thank you.

01:13:56.387 --> 01:13:59.288
Everybody,
let's take a picture together!

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:02.487
Okay, everybody get in.

01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:03.753
Oh my God.

01:14:05.587 --> 01:14:06.652
Alright.

01:14:06.654 --> 01:14:08.755
Oh, get the pie...

01:14:09.355 --> 01:14:12.418
in the picture and the cake,
it's so beautiful.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.222
Beautiful!

01:14:14.087 --> 01:14:15.655
Resident photographer here.

01:14:16.621 --> 01:14:19.421
Group effort.
Oh and don't forget this!

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:23.656
You hold it.
You were like his aunt.

01:14:25.788 --> 01:14:26.686
Okay.

01:14:26.688 --> 01:14:27.819
Alright, everybody squeeze in.

01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:30.856
One, two, three...
Say Mr. Roosevelt.

01:14:31.357 --> 01:14:33.456
Mr. Roosevelt!

01:14:34.023 --> 01:14:34.891
I got it.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:36.754
Be sure to tag me.

01:14:36.756 --> 01:14:38.220
Of course.

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:41.421
I want to propose a toast,
to all of you who came today.

01:14:41.423 --> 01:14:44.454
It's been tough the past
few days for me and Eric,

01:14:44.456 --> 01:14:46.688
but I think Mr. Roosevelt
would have really appreciated

01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.824
all of us coming together.

01:14:48.024 --> 01:14:49.323
So thank you.

01:14:50.424 --> 01:14:51.690
- We love you.
- We love you, guys.

01:14:52.957 --> 01:14:55.391
And I want to
especially thank Emily Martin.

01:14:57.423 --> 01:15:01.487
If it wasn't for her, I would
never have gotten to know him.

01:15:01.489 --> 01:15:02.425
To Emily.

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:04.490
To Emily.

01:15:08.457 --> 01:15:09.923
Don't you fucking do that.

01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:12.558
Excuse me?

01:15:13.657 --> 01:15:16.258
I know what
you're doing, Celeste.

01:15:16.924 --> 01:15:18.889
I don't know
what you're talking about?

01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:20.688
"If it wasn't for her,

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.488
"I wouldn't have gotten
to know him?"

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:24.325
Okay, we get it.

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:25.955
You're amazing.

01:15:25.957 --> 01:15:27.024
You win!

01:15:27.026 --> 01:15:28.590
You got the guy!

01:15:28.592 --> 01:15:29.857
You got the house!

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:30.423
Emily?

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.626
Sweetie...

01:15:32.526 --> 01:15:34.090
We all understand.

01:15:34.092 --> 01:15:35.925
It's okay. We're hurting too.

01:15:36.525 --> 01:15:38.055
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

01:15:38.057 --> 01:15:39.757
Oh, I'm Bonnie.

01:15:39.759 --> 01:15:42.527
Oh okay, Bonnie,
I have a question.

01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:43.492
Did you know him?

01:15:45.559 --> 01:15:47.392
Did you know Teddy Roosevelt?

01:15:47.892 --> 01:15:49.926
No, but I heard a lot about him.

01:15:50.425 --> 01:15:52.424
Oh, you heard a lot about him.

01:15:52.426 --> 01:15:53.524
That's the thing right there.

01:15:53.525 --> 01:15:55.457
None of you knew him.

01:15:55.459 --> 01:15:57.390
You're not here because
you care about Mr. Roosevelt.

01:15:57.392 --> 01:15:59.358
You're here because
you care about yourselves.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.558
So you can take pictures

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.758
for your Instagrams
and your Facebooks,

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.524
And you can say
"I did something, I was there."

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:07.827
And you, you bought pecans
from another state?

01:16:08.094 --> 01:16:09.393
Did you overnight it?

01:16:10.093 --> 01:16:11.425
What is that?

01:16:11.427 --> 01:16:12.628
That's insanity!

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.661
That's fucking insane!
That's an insane thing to do!

01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:19.629
Emily, maybe you've had
too much to drink.

01:16:20.526 --> 01:16:20.962
You think?

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:22.760
Emily...

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.991
I know why you're acting out,
and it's okay.

01:16:26.993 --> 01:16:28.458
Oh, do you?

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.094
You seem to know
everything else,

01:16:30.096 --> 01:16:31.160
so that's not a surprise,

01:16:31.162 --> 01:16:34.329
so why don't you
tell me Celeste why.

01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:36.826
You just feel guilty.

01:16:36.828 --> 01:16:37.762
Oh do I?

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:40.728
Yes, you feel guilty
for leaving him.

01:16:42.262 --> 01:16:45.361
I'm actually really happy that
you and Eric found each other,

01:16:45.363 --> 01:16:47.726
I think it's really special
what you have so...

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:48.761
Congratulations.

01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:57.363
No Emily, not Eric.

01:16:59.462 --> 01:17:00.597
Mr. Roosevelt.

01:17:02.363 --> 01:17:05.330
IT'S JUST A FUCKING CAT!

01:17:18.863 --> 01:17:19.731
No, no, no.

01:17:20.429 --> 01:17:21.364
Emily...

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.863
Emily, put Mr. Roosevelt down.

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:27.362
You don't have to do this.

01:17:27.364 --> 01:17:28.361
Emily...

01:17:28.363 --> 01:17:30.231
Emily... Please.

01:17:30.529 --> 01:17:31.630
Emily.

01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:34.632
I'm sorry.

01:17:35.963 --> 01:17:37.297
Ohhh!

01:17:37.732 --> 01:17:38.698
Get her!

01:17:45.698 --> 01:17:47.232
Mr. Roosevelt!

01:18:08.632 --> 01:18:09.695
Jen!

01:18:09.697 --> 01:18:11.831
Okay, just calm down,

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.333
just start from the beginning.

01:18:13.533 --> 01:18:14.432
What happened with Eric?

01:18:14.434 --> 01:18:16.796
Okay, after we left the party,

01:18:16.798 --> 01:18:18.696
we kind of, sort of kissed.

01:18:18.698 --> 01:18:19.634
And then we had a fight.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:21.698
And then, I don't...
I'm such a fuck-up.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.298
I don't know why I did it...

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.065
Dude, you kissed him. I don't
see what the big deal is.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.500
No, Jen, I fucked Art.

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:27.233
What?

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.064
And I woke up with him
at Eric's place.

01:18:29.066 --> 01:18:30.164
Emily.

01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:31.831
There were all these people
there,

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.031
and there was a cake with a picture of Mr.
Roosevelt on it.

01:18:33.033 --> 01:18:35.631
And I freaked out
and then I took the ashes.

01:18:35.633 --> 01:18:36.564
You took the ashes?

01:18:36.566 --> 01:18:37.467
I took the ashes.

01:18:37.934 --> 01:18:38.667
Bad ass.

01:18:38.967 --> 01:18:40.332
Yeah?

01:18:40.334 --> 01:18:42.964
So what are you going to do now?
Are you leaving tomorrow?

01:18:42.966 --> 01:18:44.064
I don't know!

01:18:44.066 --> 01:18:45.431
I don't know! I don't know!

01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:46.897
You could stay here.

01:18:46.899 --> 01:18:49.599
No. I can't, I've already
burned every bridge in Austin.

01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:51.797
I'm gonna go back to LA, and
try to get another editing gig.

01:18:51.799 --> 01:18:53.266
And then audition
for commercials and

01:18:53.268 --> 01:18:56.366
be a desperate improv comedian
who never gets a real job,

01:18:56.368 --> 01:18:59.434
and ends up being
some loser fucking waitress?

01:19:00.734 --> 01:19:02.601
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to do that.

01:19:02.935 --> 01:19:04.734
No, Jen...

01:19:05.034 --> 01:19:07.498
Jen, I didn't...
Obviously, I didn't mean...

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.066
Emily, shut up!

01:19:09.068 --> 01:19:11.970
You are amazing.
Jen, I didn't know...

01:19:12.502 --> 01:19:13.733
I even fucked this up.

01:19:13.735 --> 01:19:14.835
No, you didn't!

01:19:15.768 --> 01:19:18.599
Listen, I'm you're friend,
no matter what.

01:19:18.601 --> 01:19:20.533
But you need to grow the fuck
up.

01:19:20.535 --> 01:19:22.667
You're not the only one in
the world with fucking problems.

01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:24.833
You're right.
I don't deserve friends.

01:19:24.835 --> 01:19:27.067
God, you are so self-pitying!

01:19:27.069 --> 01:19:27.900
I'm sorry!

01:19:27.902 --> 01:19:30.869
Stop saying you're sorry!

01:19:48.537 --> 01:19:49.035
Fuck!

01:19:49.037 --> 01:19:49.503
Fuck!

01:19:50.102 --> 01:19:50.837
Where's my bike?

01:19:52.769 --> 01:19:53.769
Where's my bike?

01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:55.338
Shit, shit...

01:19:55.637 --> 01:19:56.504
Oh my God.

01:19:57.403 --> 01:19:59.069
Someone fucking stole my bike!

01:19:59.071 --> 01:20:00.905
It's so fucking obvious!

01:20:02.903 --> 01:20:05.337
Fuck everyone!

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:09.973
No, Jen.

01:20:10.537 --> 01:20:11.703
Hey, buddy.

01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:14.370
Jen, Jen, no, I don't want to.

01:20:14.372 --> 01:20:15.136
I'm just here to help.

01:20:15.138 --> 01:20:16.168
You can't do this to me.

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:17.571
- I'm here to help.
- I don't want it.

01:20:18.637 --> 01:20:19.236
I'll hit you
with a little water.

01:20:19.238 --> 01:20:20.572
No, no, no.

01:20:22.039 --> 01:20:23.803
- Don't do this.
- There's nowhere to go.

01:20:23.805 --> 01:20:24.471
No, no.

01:20:25.639 --> 01:20:27.404
Come on, Em.
You gotta face your fears.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:27.473
No.

01:20:31.105 --> 01:20:32.540
No, no.

01:20:32.872 --> 01:20:33.973
- Just trying to help.
- No!

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:36.405
- Here to help.
- NO!

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.707
Ahhhhhhhhh!

01:21:10.873 --> 01:21:14.275
Mr. Roosevelt!

01:21:15.806 --> 01:21:17.508
I'm sorry!

01:21:21.108 --> 01:21:22.942
I'm so sorry!

01:22:11.877 --> 01:22:13.777
Jen, am I a bad person?

01:22:15.444 --> 01:22:16.277
No...

01:22:17.511 --> 01:22:18.144
There's no way in hell
you're a bad person.

01:22:18.776 --> 01:22:20.641
You're a good person,

01:22:20.643 --> 01:22:22.245
with really bad execution.

01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:33.611
You ready to do this?

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:41.578
Hi.

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:46.879
There's not much of him in here.

01:22:50.379 --> 01:22:51.646
What's up?
I'm Jen.

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.779
Heard a lot about you.

01:22:55.478 --> 01:22:57.413
I'm not sure where Eric is.

01:22:57.645 --> 01:22:59.576
After this morning,
he just disappeared.

01:22:59.578 --> 01:23:00.678
And he left his phone here.

01:23:01.512 --> 01:23:03.311
I'm sure he's alright.

01:23:06.912 --> 01:23:11.246
Emily, I was just trying
to do something nice...

01:23:11.446 --> 01:23:13.745
with the brunch, and with you.

01:23:14.545 --> 01:23:15.547
Okay?

01:23:16.713 --> 01:23:19.780
I don't know how to handle
stuff like this.

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:22.444
Or maybe I went about it
the wrong way.

01:23:22.446 --> 01:23:24.478
And everyone's so upset.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.847
Everyone is so upset.

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:27.413
And you ran away.

01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:30.281
And Eric is gone and I don't
even know who you are.

01:23:31.846 --> 01:23:35.580
And I was just trying
to do something nice.

01:23:37.581 --> 01:23:40.514
And I wanted to do
something right!

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:47.981
What the fuck!

01:23:49.481 --> 01:23:52.379
This is the part where you're
supposed to start laughing.

01:23:52.381 --> 01:23:53.382
What?

01:24:09.782 --> 01:24:11.380
You want some?

01:24:11.382 --> 01:24:12.016
Yeah.

01:24:24.582 --> 01:24:27.683
I never had a pet
before Mr. Roosevelt...

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:30.016
Really? Never?

01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:31.651
No.

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:39.917
Eric.

01:24:40.516 --> 01:24:41.647
Where were you?

01:24:41.649 --> 01:24:43.817
Just walking around, thinking.

01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:45.651
- Are you wet?
- Uh-huh.

01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:49.484
Some stuff happened.

01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:57.385
Shall we do this?

01:25:56.653 --> 01:25:58.283
<i>Dear Eric and Celeste,</i>

01:25:58.285 --> 01:26:00.618
<i>Thank you for taking
such good care of me.</i>

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.784
<i>Now that I'm no longer alive, I
just want to report back and say,</i>

01:26:03.786 --> 01:26:05.721
<i>the tuna in heaven is divine.</i>

01:26:05.922 --> 01:26:07.453
<i>Love, Mr. Roosevelt.</i>

01:26:07.455 --> 01:26:10.052
<i>PS: I know my mom Emily
was kind of a cunt,</i>

01:26:10.054 --> 01:26:11.851
<i>but she's grown up a lot
over this weekend.</i>

01:26:11.853 --> 01:26:13.351
<i>Thank you for showing her
what a family looks like.</i>

01:26:13.353 --> 01:26:16.619
<i>She thinks you guys are building
something great together.</i>

01:26:16.621 --> 01:26:18.821
<i>And the wood floors
look awesome.</i>

01:26:22.954 --> 01:26:24.518
<i>PPS: Sorry I broke your thing.</i>

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.919
<i>I tried to fix it
as best as I could.</i>

<i>PPPS: Hey, just in case you didn't
know, this is Emily writing this.</i>

01:26:38.721 --> 01:26:39.656
Hi, is Jen home?

01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:46.754
I thought you were gone.

01:26:46.756 --> 01:26:48.219
Yeah. I'm going to be leaving

01:26:48.221 --> 01:26:52.457
I just wanted to say goodbye
to you before you left for tour.

01:26:52.789 --> 01:26:54.855
What? I'm not going on tour.

01:26:54.857 --> 01:26:58.491
You say that now,
but maybe this...

01:26:58.888 --> 01:26:59.824
will change your mind.

01:27:01.756 --> 01:27:03.554
"mdotclark79"

01:27:03.556 --> 01:27:06.155
"This drummer is sick.
Come to Cincinnati."

01:27:06.157 --> 01:27:08.555
The people have spoken.
They love you.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.020
Dude, maybe I will go on tour.

01:27:10.022 --> 01:27:13.258
Yeah you will. Guess my YouTube
came in handy for something.

01:27:13.457 --> 01:27:14.690
Fuck yeah!

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:18.358
Well, Jen, I'm gonna miss you.

01:27:19.555 --> 01:27:21.055
I'm gonna miss you, too, man.

01:27:21.057 --> 01:27:22.657
Bring it in. Bring it in.

01:27:23.022 --> 01:27:24.690
- Oh my God.
- Yeah!

01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:29.892
Well, I guess that's it.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:31.491
See you.

01:27:32.391 --> 01:27:33.589
Oh, wait Jen, I almost forgot.

01:27:33.591 --> 01:27:36.655
I am flat broke.
Can I get a ride to the airport?

01:27:36.657 --> 01:27:38.491
- Oh, fuck you.
- Okay.

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:41.659
- I'll get my keys.
- Okay.
