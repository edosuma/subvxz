tonight with broken arms.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.433
Ha ha, no I'm not
looking for Kid Danger.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.436
I am...
a real doctor.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.505
Arms are my specialty.
And I'm...

09:32.571 --> 09:37.443
looking for work.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.979
Hello? Hello?

09:40.046 --> 09:43.482
Ugh, that guy hung up on me
in the middle of my lie.

09:43.549 --> 09:46.018
That is so rude!

09:46.085 --> 09:47.353
- Sorry, honey.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.722
I got my own problems
with this pickle jar.

09:51.557 --> 09:55.127
- Hey, I'm home.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.296
[ yawns ]

09:57.363 --> 09:59.966
Henry-wayyy,
I am tired...

10:00.032 --> 10:02.535
So uh, I'm gonna
hit the sack.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.904
- Wait, Henry!
- Hmm?

10:04.971 --> 10:06.706
- Do you know anyone
about your age,

10:06.772 --> 10:09.175
about your height,
who has a broken arm?

10:09.241 --> 10:11.811
- What? I mean, uh--

10:11.877 --> 10:14.513
I don't know why
you're asking me that--

10:14.580 --> 10:16.615
I was just--
I mean you can't--

10:16.682 --> 10:20.119
This is a new sweater
and it belongs to me.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.722
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing! Okay.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.290
I'm just--I'm tired!
Alright.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.092
Remember me stretching?
Alright, I'm going to bed.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.893
- It's five o'clock.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.330
- Already? Whew!

10:31.397 --> 10:35.167
I am plum-tuckered.

10:35.234 --> 10:36.635
Goodnight everybody.

10:36.702 --> 10:39.438
- Wait, honey...
- Whaaaat?

10:39.505 --> 10:42.308
- Can you open this
pickle jar for me?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.076
- Why can't dad do it?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.512
- He tried. A lot.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.913
But Piper called
him a weakling.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.682
So he's in the kitchen
lifting weights

10:49.749 --> 10:51.884
to prove he's strong.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.522
- Well, maybe that'll
make him stronger

10:56.589 --> 10:58.124
so he can finally
open the pickle jar.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.459
Again, plum-tuckered.
Goodnight.

11:00.526 --> 11:03.362
- Henryyyy...

11:03.429 --> 11:06.265
mamma hungry for pickles.

11:06.332 --> 11:10.403
- Okay...I guess
I'm opening the pickle jar...

11:10.469 --> 11:12.905
with my hands...

11:12.972 --> 11:14.573
- How else would
you open a jar?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.609
- No other way.
Gotta use my hands.

11:16.675 --> 11:20.846
Let's get this done.
Lemme just real quick...

11:20.913 --> 11:23.883
- Why are you doing it that?
- This is what people do.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.451
This is how they open it now.
- Why don't you just now...

11:25.518 --> 11:28.087
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm totally fine...

11:28.154 --> 11:29.755
- Will you stop fooling around.
- Use both hands...

11:29.822 --> 11:31.357
- Just open pickle jar.
- The knees do the trick.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.225
- You know how hands work?
- You are worse than your dad.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.861
- Use the pits.
- What?

11:35.928 --> 11:37.663
- Oh my god, it's
the Playground Pooper!

11:37.730 --> 11:40.533
- What?!
- Really?!

11:40.599 --> 11:44.804
- What did you do?!
- I guess I dropped it.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.073
Sorry. Technically
it is open though.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.775
And also, I'm really tired--
I'm going to bed.

11:49.842 --> 11:52.511
- Hey Henry,
come give me a spot.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.947
- Uhh, Dad,
I'm really tired.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.482
So I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go to bed.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.683
- Henry, give
your father a spot.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.351
- He asked you
for a spot.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.520
You gotta give him a spot.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.090
- I guess I'm
giving him a spot.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.958
- You probably
won't need to,

12:06.025 --> 12:08.461
but if I can't lift this bar up,
just help me a little bit.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.695
- Got it.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.530
- Okay, gonna do ten.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.165
- Great.

by the stairs.

a basketball at you.

in your fake arm

like it's broken.

It'll be a lot funnier
than Charlotte's idea.

- Okay, but what if the
basketball doesn't hit me--

- That's impossible,
it's you.

- No it's not!

- Heya!
- Ahhh!

- How'd you
get in there?!

18:51.630 --> 18:54.266
- Wasn't easy.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.236
I have an idea that will solve
all of Henry's problems.

- So do I!
- Clog it, Pooper.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.073
Whaddaya got, Schwoz?

19:01.139 --> 19:03.041
- We set off a memory wave

and everyone within
a three block radius

19:05.077 --> 19:06.912
has no memory
of any of it.

Or anything else
in their lives.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.984
- I mean maybe.
- It is simple.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.385
- Yeah but what's
funny about it?

Like...when
am I going "haha"?

- Guys! I have a solution
and it's really funny.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.795
Okay there's been
a lot of speculation today

19:23.862 --> 19:25.731
that Henry is Kid Danger.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.333
- He is!
- He's not!

19:28.400 --> 19:29.868
But he does have something
he wants to announce.

19:29.935 --> 19:33.038
- I don't know if I can--
- Henry Hart everyone!

19:36.275 --> 19:38.944
- Thank you. I...

19:39.011 --> 19:41.013
Oh. Right.

19:41.079 --> 19:42.648
My sister's podium.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.650
Glad that's here.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.351
- And a microphone.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.020
Thank you, L'Orange.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.988
And a sign language
interpreter.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.824
Great.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.395
Okay, I know that there's
a lot of speculation

19:56.461 --> 20:00.632
that, due to my broken arm,
I am Kid Danger.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.534
- Ahhh!

20:02.601 --> 20:04.269
- But the fact
of the matter is

20:04.336 --> 20:06.538
I'm NOT Kid Danger

20:06.605 --> 20:10.943
because...

20:11.009 --> 20:14.446
I am, well...

20:14.513 --> 20:17.649
I am the Playground Pooper.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.120
- So you're Kid Danger
AND the Playground Pooper?!

20:22.187 --> 20:26.658
- What?! No no no no
no no no...

20:26.725 --> 20:29.895
No. I'm just...

20:29.962 --> 20:32.297
the Playground Pooper.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.766
- Okay this is funny.

20:34.833 --> 20:39.037
- Prove it! Prove it!

20:39.104 --> 20:41.940
Prove it, prove it!
Prove it...

20:42.007 --> 20:43.709
- As you can see

20:43.775 --> 20:47.245
in this security camera
footage of me...

20:47.312 --> 20:50.515
doin' what I love...

20:50.582 --> 20:53.452
It's time stamped.
Which proves

20:53.518 --> 20:56.221
that at the exact same time
that Kid Danger--

20:56.288 --> 20:58.857
WHOEVER HE IS--

20:58.924 --> 21:01.526
was getting his arm broken
by Doctor Karaté...

21:01.593 --> 21:04.529
I was on the playground--

21:04.596 --> 21:06.465
- Poopin'?

21:06.531 --> 21:09.134
- Yes Melvin, thank you.
I was poopin'.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.504
- Ohh...
- That's disgusting.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.774
- So obviously...
I uh...

21:15.841 --> 21:17.776
I'm not Kid Danger, okay?

21:17.843 --> 21:19.711
Please respect my privacy
as I seek help

21:19.778 --> 21:22.114
during this difficult time,
thank you.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.750
- Wait!

21:24.816 --> 21:27.252
How did you
break your arm then?

21:27.319 --> 21:30.422
- Oooh.
- Ahhhh.

21:30.489 --> 21:34.626
- Yes. How did
I break my arm?

21:34.693 --> 21:38.830
After I...
did my thang...

21:38.897 --> 21:39.965
I slipped.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.768
- On poop?!
- Yes, Melvin.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.404
On poop.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.838
- Henry's
the Playground Pooper

21:46.905 --> 21:48.874
and he slipped on his own
poop and broke his arm!

21:48.940 --> 21:52.644
[ laughter ]

21:52.711 --> 21:55.380
- No one likes you, Melvin.
No one likes you.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.849
- No further questions.
