14:38.661 --> 14:42.247
Well, at least they didn't go to waste.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.252
I'm going to ask the teacher if I can be
Mary in the Christmas play this year.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.713
She's already asked me, sir.

14:49.881 --> 14:51.840
I think I'll be great in the part.

14:52.008 --> 14:53.884
She asked me yesterday.

14:54.052 --> 14:56.720
I like the part
where the angel Gabriel talks to her.

14:56.888 --> 14:59.932
Why would Gabriel talk to you?
You never listen.

15:00.099 --> 15:04.102
I can probably wear these same sandals.

[TEACHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

15:07.148 --> 15:12.027
Yes, ma'am. I'd like to volunteer to play
the part of Mary in our Christmas play.

[TEACHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

15:18.535 --> 15:21.954
That's right, sir. She asked me yesterday.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.581
Mary never wore glasses.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.836
Hey, Chuck, did Mary ever wear glasses?

15:31.130 --> 15:33.090
What do you mean, "Mary who?"

15:33.258 --> 15:38.470
In the Bible. Does it say anything
about Mary wearing glasses?

15:40.682 --> 15:43.559
Then how can Marcie play Mary
instead of me?

15:43.726 --> 15:46.728
And the teacher says
I'm going to be playing a sheep.

15:47.397 --> 15:50.691
Why can't I ever be a wrong number?

15:53.444 --> 15:57.656
Guess what? I've been asked to be in
the Christmas play.

15:57.949 --> 15:59.908
I'm going to be an angel.

16:00.076 --> 16:02.452
All I have to do is say, "Hark."

16:04.622 --> 16:07.165
This is what I have to do
in the Christmas play.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.169
When the sheep are through dancing,
I come out and say, "Hark."

16:11.337 --> 16:14.089
Then Harold Angel starts to sing.

16:14.257 --> 16:16.216
Harold Angel?

16:16.384 --> 16:19.219
It's right here in the script.

16:22.974 --> 16:24.891
Hark! How did that sound?

16:25.059 --> 16:27.894
I'm practicing my line
for the Christmas play.

16:28.062 --> 16:30.772
I live in mortal dread of getting out
on the stage...

16:30.940 --> 16:33.150
...and forgetting what I am to say.

16:33.318 --> 16:37.779
Well, if you did,
you could always make up something.

16:37.947 --> 16:41.575
That's true. How about, "Hey"?

16:41.743 --> 16:44.286
Not very biblical.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.085
Here's the line I have to say
in the Christmas play.

16:52.253 --> 16:54.504
See if I get it right.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.882
Hark.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.884
You got it.

17:00.678 --> 17:04.848
I have always wondered how actors
remember all those lines.

17:08.685 --> 17:12.689
I'm all set for the Christmas play.
Do I look like an angel?

17:12.857 --> 17:14.775
You look fine.

17:16.486 --> 17:18.654
Good luck. Break a leg.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.323
Linus and I will be in the audience.

if it brings joy to the audience.

Every time there's a Christmas play...

17:59.278 --> 18:00.904
...I end up being a sheep.

18:01.072 --> 18:04.116
- Watch out for the curb here, sir.
- What?

18:04.450 --> 18:06.910
Slouching toward Bethlehem, huh, sir?

18:07.078 --> 18:10.122
I can't stand it.

You look cute in your sheep costume, sir.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.922
PEPPERMINT PATTY:
Sure, Marcie, sure.

18:19.257 --> 18:23.176
I was up late last night
memorizing all my lines.

18:23.344 --> 18:26.471
All your lines.

18:27.348 --> 18:29.975
I can't remember my lines, Marcie.

You're a sheep, sir.
All you have to say is, "Baa."

18:33.771 --> 18:36.732
My mind has gone blank. I'm doomed.

18:36.899 --> 18:39.985
I wonder if this happened
to Laurence Olivier?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.158
Hark.

18:46.576 --> 18:48.160
Hark.

18:49.704 --> 18:52.497

if they make you be a sheep?
