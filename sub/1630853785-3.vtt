21:16.609 --> 21:18.978
And I could see you were,
like, so relieved

21:19.079 --> 21:21.181
every time he didn't hit you,
and when it was over

21:21.214 --> 21:22.449
you both were like,

21:22.482 --> 21:25.185
"Yes, we did it
without hitting each other."

21:25.218 --> 21:26.720
- Simon, what do you think?

21:26.753 --> 21:30.156
- What you do...I can only
imagine how scary it is.

21:30.190 --> 21:31.958
- If you want to try,
I invite you.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.594
- Yes, go ahead, Simon, go.
- For sure.

21:34.627 --> 21:39.132
all: [chanting "Simon"]

21:39.165 --> 21:40.734
- Okay.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.169
[cheering]

21:45.638 --> 21:49.009
all: [chanting "Simon"]

21:49.109 --> 21:51.144
- Okay.
- Really?

21:51.177 --> 21:53.146
- Okay, what do I do?
- Okay, you just

21:53.179 --> 21:54.581
stand in the middle...
- Okay.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.516
- Without moving.
- Okay.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.118
Have you watched
the show before?

21:58.118 --> 22:00.286
- [laughs]
Yeah.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.055
- Do you like me?

22:02.088 --> 22:03.923
- Yes, of course.
[laughs]

22:03.957 --> 22:06.059
- Do you like me?
- Yes, of course.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.128
- I guess it's safer
than being on a bike.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.529
- Howie, shut up.
- Okay.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.066
Oh, no.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.373
both: [screams]

22:27.313 --> 22:28.915
- Okay, what do I do?
- Okay, you just

22:28.948 --> 22:30.183
stand in the middle...
- Okay.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.918
- Without moving.
- Okay.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.088
- I guess it's safer

22:35.088 --> 22:36.690
- Howie, shut up.
- Okay.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.358

I can see that.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.555
I'm definitely saying yes.

did that look?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.172
That was scary.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.207
- Hello, sir.
I'm Terry Crews.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.709
Well, what are you
gonna do here on "AGT"?

24:02.742 --> 24:04.744
- I'm gonna be doing
a little ventriloquism.

24:04.778 --> 24:09.315
- Oh, well, you know there is
a huge and wonderful history

24:09.349 --> 24:12.185
of ventriloquism here on "AGT."

24:12.218 --> 24:13.853
<i>Like Terry Fator...</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

24:13.887 --> 24:16.156
<i>Darci Lynne.</i>
<i>Talk to me about that legacy.</i>

24:16.189 --> 24:18.124
- It's always been my dream.

24:18.158 --> 24:19.693
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>

24:19.726 --> 24:21.761
<i>I always really wanted</i>
<i>to make people laugh.</i>

24:21.795 --> 24:23.763
<i>So I randomly asked my dad,</i>

24:23.797 --> 24:25.732
"Do you have
a ventriloquist dummy?"

24:25.765 --> 24:28.601
And he just looked at me
and he was like...

24:28.635 --> 24:29.703
"Yes."

24:29.736 --> 24:31.071
<i>- * Whoo hoo hoo hoo... *</i>

24:31.104 --> 24:34.074
<i>- I just started practicing,</i>
<i>like, every day</i>

24:34.074 --> 24:37.310
and my school had
a third-grade talent show.

24:37.344 --> 24:39.546
- One, two, three and...

24:39.579 --> 24:40.947
[laughter]

24:40.980 --> 24:43.249
The feeling I get when
I make somebody else laugh...

24:43.283 --> 24:44.584
Thank you.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.620
Gives me that same rush
I had when I was a kid.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.290
<i>Currently, what I do</i>
<i>is social media,</i>

24:50.323 --> 24:52.225
<i>and I feel like</i>
<i>everything that I've done</i>

24:52.258 --> 24:54.294
has kind of led up
to this moment.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.829
- Here it is, man.
It's your time.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.863
- Thank you, man.
- Thank so much.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.398
Go right on out.

24:58.431 --> 25:00.233
<i>Being on this show</i>

25:00.266 --> 25:02.669
is kind of,
like, the quintessential

25:02.702 --> 25:04.504
<i>stamp of approval</i>
<i>for a ventriloquist</i>

25:04.537 --> 25:06.306
which has always been my dream.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.641
<i>- * My life *</i>

25:08.675 --> 25:10.643
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.312
- Who are you?
Where you from?

25:12.345 --> 25:14.781
- My name is Jack Williams.
- Yes.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.517
- I am from Indianapolis,
Indiana.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.885
[cheering]

25:18.918 --> 25:22.122
- And I'm guessing
you are a magician.

25:22.155 --> 25:25.158
- Close. I am a ventriloquist.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.460
- Ooh.
- Yes.

25:27.494 --> 25:30.230
- Do you also know who
is a very good ventriloquist?

25:30.263 --> 25:31.297
- Right there.
- Exactly.

25:31.331 --> 25:34.300
- Fellow ventriloquist.
- Yeah.

25:34.334 --> 25:36.603
- We actually had
three winners so far.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.339
- Exactly. It's, honestly,
big shoes to fill.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.409
Terry was one of the first
ventriloquists I ever saw.

25:42.442 --> 25:44.911
And when I saw him on the
stage, I just thought, like,

25:44.944 --> 25:46.846
"I just want to do that.
That's amazing."

25:46.880 --> 25:48.415
And that's why I wanted
to come here today.

25:48.448 --> 25:51.584
I want to do this live,
like, on the Vegas strip.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.219
[cheering]

25:53.253 --> 25:55.455
- Well, good luck to you.
- Thank you.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.657
- And we can't wait
to meet your friend.

26:02.028 --> 26:05.432
- Guys, give it up for
my good buddy, Foster.

26:05.465 --> 26:07.067
Ready, buddy?
- Yeah.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.736
- Here we go.
- Whoo.

26:09.769 --> 26:13.340
- Hello.

26:13.373 --> 26:15.709
- Here we are, buddy, "AGT."

26:15.742 --> 26:20.413
- My plan is working.

26:23.216 --> 26:24.617
- What's your plan?

26:24.651 --> 26:27.887
- Well, basically, I used you
to smuggle me out here,

26:27.921 --> 26:33.326
and now I'm gonna
show my talent.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.327
- He's funny.

26:34.361 --> 26:36.262
- Cute.
- So cute.

26:36.296 --> 26:40.066
- What's your talent?
- Ventriloquism.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.068
- That's what I'm doing
right now.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.571
- Really?
- Yes.

26:44.604 --> 26:45.939
- [laughs]

26:45.972 --> 26:48.074
- You think you're a better
ventriloquist than me?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.076
You think you can talk
without moving your lips?

26:50.076 --> 26:52.078
- Well, I don't have any,
so yeah.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.680
- Okay.
- [laughs]

26:53.713 --> 26:55.081
- Well, let's see
who's the better ventriloquist

26:55.081 --> 26:56.316
by doing some tongue twisters.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.585
I'll start by saying
Sally sells seashells

26:58.618 --> 27:00.086
by the seashore,
and then you go after.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.154
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:04.424 --> 27:06.459
- Sally sells sea...

27:06.493 --> 27:07.527
Sally--
- Come on!

27:07.560 --> 27:09.095
- Okay.
[laughter]

27:09.129 --> 27:11.064
Sally...
- It's like this.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.932
Sally sells seashells
by the seashore.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.567
Sally sells
seashells by the seashore.

27:14.601 --> 27:17.037
Sally sells seashells
by the seashore.

27:17.037 --> 27:18.338
- Whoa.

27:22.342 --> 27:27.681
- Can you do that
without moving your mouth?

27:27.714 --> 27:28.848
- [laughs]

27:28.882 --> 27:31.151
- No. No, I can't.

27:31.184 --> 27:32.352
- I love him.

27:32.385 --> 27:34.688
- I'm gonna do something
I said I would never do.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.123
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.259
- Please.

27:39.292 --> 27:40.794
No.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.563
- I'm gonna throw your voice.
- What?

27:43.596 --> 27:48.301
[gradually fades]
What, what, what, what, what?

27:48.335 --> 27:49.803
- Wow.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.906
[no sound]

27:52.939 --> 27:55.642
- I threw your voice.
It's gone.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.144
It's gone.
It's over there.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.715
- [silence]
[laughter]

28:07.687 --> 28:09.022
Wait, wait, wait,
listen, listen.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.757
I think I hear it coming back.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.760
- [crescendo-ing]
What, what, what, what, what,

28:13.793 --> 28:16.763
what, what, what, what,
what, what, what...

28:16.796 --> 28:18.932
What?

28:19.032 --> 28:20.567
I...

28:20.600 --> 28:22.869
I have your voice.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.474
And that means...

28:27.507 --> 28:30.076

29:12.152 --> 29:15.789

- Thank you very much.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.123
- You're not only
a ventriloquist,

29:17.157 --> 29:18.725
but you're an amazing comedian

29:18.758 --> 29:22.328
and poking fun at the
actual art of ventriloquism,

29:22.362 --> 29:24.164
which I thought was unique
and original.

29:24.197 --> 29:27.500
And here, on "AGT",
we love unique and original.

29:27.534 --> 29:29.936
You're amazing.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.771
- Sofía.

29:31.805 --> 29:33.173
- That was perfection.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.575
I mean, coming from
someone like me,

29:35.608 --> 29:37.143

29:47.520 --> 29:49.823
As you can tell,
we love this kind of act.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.626
I would say, I think in terms
of a first audition,

29:53.660 --> 29:56.930
one of the best we've ever had.
- Thank you.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.099
- Yes, absolutely.

29:59.132 --> 30:02.902

1:09:41.114 --> 1:09:43.616
but part of why
I wanted to come to

1:09:43.650 --> 1:09:46.820
"America's Got Talent" is
watching so many other comics

1:09:46.853 --> 1:09:49.589
with disabilities come here
and succeed before I did.

1:09:49.622 --> 1:09:52.625
Like Drew Lynch,
DJ Demers years ago.

1:09:52.659 --> 1:09:54.327
[cheering]

1:09:54.361 --> 1:09:55.562
Yeah.

1:09:56.963 --> 1:09:59.399
When I see other people
with disability on this stage

1:09:59.432 --> 1:10:02.569
and thriving, I know that
they were given the tools

1:10:02.602 --> 1:10:05.271
to be able to succeed here
which is...

1:10:05.305 --> 1:10:06.539
Yeah.

1:10:06.573 --> 1:10:09.242
- Thank you so much then
for being here tonight.

1:10:09.275 --> 1:10:10.410
We're ready for you.

1:10:12.012 --> 1:10:13.713
- Thank you.
Okay. I'm gonna start.

1:10:17.183 --> 1:10:20.620
So I dual majored in college.

1:10:20.653 --> 1:10:22.555
I studied sign language

1:10:22.589 --> 1:10:26.693
and...Which that felt like
a freebie, right?

1:10:26.726 --> 1:10:30.764
But I also majored
in zoo-keeping,

1:10:30.797 --> 1:10:33.633
which seemed like
a really fun thing at the time,

1:10:33.667 --> 1:10:37.437
but now I have a degree
in American Sign Language

1:10:37.470 --> 1:10:40.440
and zoo-keeping.

1:10:40.473 --> 1:10:42.976
And Koko
the sign language gorilla

1:10:43.009 --> 1:10:45.211
died, like, four years ago.

1:10:45.245 --> 1:10:47.881
[laughter]

1:10:47.914 --> 1:10:52.085
So what I'm saying is that
comedy has to work out for me.

1:10:52.118 --> 1:10:53.653
[laughter]

1:10:53.687 --> 1:10:56.589
Yeah, this has to go, guys.
This has to go good.

1:10:56.623 --> 1:11:00.160
My safety net is dead.
She's gone, so...

1:11:00.193 --> 1:11:01.628
I know, it's very sad.

1:11:01.661 --> 1:11:03.530
So I, actually,
I applied to work

1:11:03.563 --> 1:11:05.632
at the Koko Foundation
when I was in college

1:11:05.665 --> 1:11:08.735
and they rejected me
because I have hearing loss.

1:11:08.768 --> 1:11:10.770
[crowd booing]

1:11:10.804 --> 1:11:15.208
But they...yes,
boo the Koko Foundation.

1:11:15.241 --> 1:11:17.644
They told me
I was a liability issue

1:11:17.677 --> 1:11:20.080
because if the gorilla
were to sneak up on me,

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:22.082
I would not be able to hear it.

1:11:22.082 --> 1:11:26.219
Which I can't say
with any degree of certainty,

1:11:26.252 --> 1:11:28.955
but probably.
That seems true.

1:11:28.988 --> 1:11:30.423
So you guys seem like
a nice crowd

1:11:30.457 --> 1:11:32.092
full of hearing people,

1:11:32.125 --> 1:11:34.994
so I'm just gonna toss this
question out into the room.

1:11:35.095 --> 1:11:38.631
Um...What are
y'all gonna do different

1:11:38.665 --> 1:11:40.300
if a gorilla sneaks up on you?

1:11:40.333 --> 1:11:42.302
[laughter]

1:11:42.335 --> 1:11:44.371
Yeah, thank you.
I would love to know.

1:11:44.404 --> 1:11:49.009
[cheering]

1:11:49.109 --> 1:11:50.944
- That makes a lot of sense.

1:11:50.977 --> 1:11:52.412
- DM me after the show.

1:11:52.445 --> 1:11:55.115
I am just desperate to know
what home field advantage

1:11:55.115 --> 1:11:58.818
y'all have with
your two-second head start.

1:11:58.852 --> 1:12:01.588
Ridiculous.
Nothing. Nothing.

1:12:01.621 --> 1:12:03.690
The only different you're gonna
do different than me

1:12:03.723 --> 1:12:05.325
is die scared--
that's it.

1:12:05.358 --> 1:12:07.394
[laughter]

1:12:07.427 --> 1:12:09.062
That's the only thing.
Yeah.

1:12:09.095 --> 1:12:10.263
Thank you.

1:12:10.296 --> 1:12:14.401
[cheers and applause]

1:12:15.535 --> 1:12:18.772
- Hayden, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

1:12:18.805 --> 1:12:20.774
I had a great time
listening to you.

1:12:20.807 --> 1:12:22.609
I love that you
make fun of yourself.

1:12:22.642 --> 1:12:25.545
I was laughing the whole time.

1:12:25.578 --> 1:12:27.447
Heidi, what do you think?

1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:30.116
- We have amazing comedians
on this show

1:12:30.150 --> 1:12:32.118
and I think that you would be
a great addition

1:12:32.152 --> 1:12:33.853
to what we already have

1:12:33.887 --> 1:12:36.790
so you can really
battle it out with them.

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:41.895
- Simon.
- Was that a true story?

1:12:42.962 --> 1:12:43.997
- Yes.

1:12:44.097 --> 1:12:46.700
- I mean,
it's brilliantly funny.

1:12:48.201 --> 1:12:50.203
So seriously, and the fact
that you can turn that

1:12:50.236 --> 1:12:52.639
into a funny story,
which is so crazy

1:12:52.672 --> 1:12:54.207
that they would do that.

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:57.010
To your point,
what difference does it make?

1:12:57.110 --> 1:12:58.712
You know?
- I, you know...

1:12:58.745 --> 1:13:00.213
- I'm with you.
- I've been trying to start

1:13:00.246 --> 1:13:02.048
Twitter beef with them
for, like, ten years,

1:13:02.048 --> 1:13:03.083
so if you guys want...

1:13:03.116 --> 1:13:06.152
- That's it.
I'll join you.

1:13:06.186 --> 1:13:11.057
I can also see this means
an awful lot to you.

1:13:11.091 --> 1:13:13.827
- Yeah, I...
It's really a privilege

1:13:13.860 --> 1:13:15.261
and an honor
to just be here.

1:13:15.295 --> 1:13:17.230
So thank you.

1:13:18.598 --> 1:13:20.934
- I'm really happy that we met.

1:13:21.801 --> 1:13:23.069
- Thank you so much.

1:13:23.069 --> 1:13:25.505
- I think we're gonna
vote now for you.

1:13:25.538 --> 1:13:27.607
Heidi, what is your vote?

1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.175
- I want to see you more.

1:13:29.209 --> 1:13:30.977
So I'm gonna give you
your first yes.

1:13:31.077 --> 1:13:32.345
<i>- * I am here *</i>

1:13:32.379 --> 1:13:34.514
- [mouthing] Thank you.

1:13:34.547 --> 1:13:36.716
<i>- * I am here *</i>

1:13:36.750 --> 1:13:39.552
- I am going
to give you your second yes.

1:13:39.586 --> 1:13:40.887
<i>- * So there's</i>
<i>nothing to fear *</i>

1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:42.355
- [mouths thank you]

1:13:42.389 --> 1:13:43.423
- Simon.

1:13:43.456 --> 1:13:45.492
- Hayden, I'm saying
yes to you

1:13:45.525 --> 1:13:48.228
and Julie, I'm also saying
yes to you.

1:13:48.261 --> 1:13:49.262
- [laughs]

1:13:49.295 --> 1:13:53.099
[wild cheering]

1:13:55.535 --> 1:13:57.337
- Good luck, Hayden.

1:13:57.370 --> 1:13:58.972
I think Howie
would have loved her.

1:13:59.005 --> 1:14:00.807
- Yeah, she's sweet.

1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:03.710
- Hayden, talk to me.
You seem very emotional.

1:14:03.743 --> 1:14:07.213
Talk to me right now.
What are you feeling?

1:14:07.247 --> 1:14:11.785
- Just validation
from some place that really

1:14:11.818 --> 1:14:13.653
meant a lot to me
in starting this.

1:14:13.687 --> 1:14:16.423
<i>And to be here,</i>
<i>it's unbelievable</i>

1:14:16.456 --> 1:14:19.125
and I felt like I already won
just making it to tonight.

1:14:19.159 --> 1:14:21.861
And that was even better.

1:14:21.895 --> 1:14:23.697
<i>- * So let me ask you *</i>

1:14:29.602 --> 1:14:31.538
- Superbowl ain't got
nothing on this, y'all.

1:14:31.571 --> 1:14:32.806
Let's go.

1:14:32.839 --> 1:14:34.307
<i>- * You can be the greatest *</i>

1:14:34.341 --> 1:14:35.742
<i>* You can be the best *</i>

1:14:35.775 --> 1:14:37.711
<i>- All right, team,</i>
<i>look, we've come a long way,</i>

1:14:37.744 --> 1:14:38.845
<i>we've been practicing.</i>

1:14:38.878 --> 1:14:40.547
- What time is it?
- Game time!

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:42.082
- What time is it?
- Game time!

1:14:42.115 --> 1:14:44.384
<i>- Ready.</i>
<i>Ready for this.</i>

1:14:44.417 --> 1:14:47.120
<i>- One, two, three, "AGT"!</i>

1:14:47.153 --> 1:14:48.922
<i>- * Standing in</i>
<i>the hall of fame *</i>

1:14:48.955 --> 1:14:50.824
<i>* Ooh, yeah *</i>

1:14:50.857 --> 1:14:53.126
- All right, wow, wow, wow.

1:14:53.159 --> 1:14:55.428
I feel like
I'm right at home, man.

1:14:55.462 --> 1:14:57.764
I know that you guys
have played in the NFL.

1:14:57.797 --> 1:14:59.599
Tell me what teams
you played for.

1:14:59.632 --> 1:15:01.701
- Carolina Panthers.
- Atlanta Falcons.

1:15:01.735 --> 1:15:03.870
- Buffalo Bills.
- Chicago Bears.

1:15:03.903 --> 1:15:06.406
- New England Patriots.
And San Francisco 49ers.

1:15:06.439 --> 1:15:10.477
- Talk to me about what are
you guys here to do on "AGT"?

1:15:10.510 --> 1:15:11.778
- We're here for two reasons.

1:15:11.811 --> 1:15:14.881
The first is,
we've spent a lot of our time

1:15:14.914 --> 1:15:16.683
preparing and prepping
to play football

1:15:16.716 --> 1:15:19.352
at a really high level,
but inside all of us,

1:15:19.386 --> 1:15:22.822
there's still this little kid
that always had this dream

1:15:22.856 --> 1:15:25.925
to sing on a big stage,
and that is happening.

1:15:25.959 --> 1:15:28.061
So, you know, that dream
is coming alive.

1:15:28.061 --> 1:15:30.063
And I got to tell you,
we're actively recruiting, sir.

1:15:30.063 --> 1:15:31.064
- Yes.
- And I know...

1:15:31.064 --> 1:15:32.298
- Oh.
[coughs]

1:15:32.332 --> 1:15:33.667
- Come on now.
Let me hear it.

1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:35.602
- I feel like I'm back
in the locker room today.

1:15:35.635 --> 1:15:37.637
[mimics dog bark]
- Break it down for us.

1:15:37.671 --> 1:15:39.706
- All right, fellas, let's go.

1:15:39.739 --> 1:15:41.274
<i>- * You can throw</i>
<i>your hands up *</i>

1:15:41.307 --> 1:15:42.575
<i>* You can beat the clock *</i>

1:15:42.609 --> 1:15:43.877
<i>* You can move the mountain *</i>

1:15:43.910 --> 1:15:45.345
<i>* You can break rocks *</i>

1:15:45.378 --> 1:15:46.880
<i>* You can be a master *</i>

1:15:46.913 --> 1:15:48.281
<i>* Don't wait for luck *</i>

1:15:48.314 --> 1:15:50.216
<i>* Dedicate your... *</i>
- Hello.

1:15:50.250 --> 1:15:51.418
How are you?

1:15:51.451 --> 1:15:53.753
- We are wonderful, Simon.
We are wonderful.

1:15:53.787 --> 1:15:56.156
- Well, I can see that.

1:15:56.189 --> 1:15:57.757
It's very,
very nice to meet you.

1:15:57.791 --> 1:15:59.526
Now, tell me your name.

1:15:59.559 --> 1:16:02.462
- So we're the Players' choir,
Football Players' choir.

1:16:02.495 --> 1:16:04.431
We play professional football,
all of us.

1:16:04.464 --> 1:16:06.032
- Whoa!
- Oh.

1:16:09.035 --> 1:16:11.071
- Do you all play
for different teams?

1:16:11.104 --> 1:16:13.273
- Well, some of played
on the same team.

1:16:13.306 --> 1:16:14.774
- Yeah.
- But majority,

1:16:14.808 --> 1:16:16.142
we all played
on different teams,

1:16:16.176 --> 1:16:18.278
went against each other.
Yeah.

1:16:18.311 --> 1:16:23.249
- Okay, so you were kind of
rivals and now you're friends.

1:16:23.283 --> 1:16:25.051
- Teammates, brothers.
- That's right.

1:16:25.051 --> 1:16:26.186
- Yeah.

1:16:26.219 --> 1:16:27.387
- This is amazing.

1:16:27.420 --> 1:16:30.757
[cheering]

1:16:30.790 --> 1:16:32.292
How did you get started?

1:16:32.325 --> 1:16:35.962
- In 2004, we got on the stage

1:16:36.062 --> 1:16:38.064
with a gospel concert
that we do every year,

1:16:38.064 --> 1:16:40.967
every Superbowl, it's called
Celebration of Gospel.

1:16:41.067 --> 1:16:44.104
And Patti LaBelle got on stage

1:16:44.137 --> 1:16:46.072
and she said,

1:16:46.106 --> 1:16:47.774
"I see all these
good-looking men.

1:16:47.807 --> 1:16:49.242
Let me see who can sing."

1:16:49.275 --> 1:16:51.478
And she started
passing the mic around

1:16:51.511 --> 1:16:54.647
and she found out
some of us got a little talent.

1:16:54.681 --> 1:16:56.149
And so that's
how it all started.

1:16:56.182 --> 1:16:58.084
- Are you serious?
- Yes, Patti LaBelle.

1:16:58.118 --> 1:16:59.586
- That started.
- [laughs]

1:16:59.619 --> 1:17:01.755
- That's so cool.

1:17:01.788 --> 1:17:05.458
- Okay, so from there,
what happened next?

1:17:05.492 --> 1:17:07.827
- Well, we formed
the Players' choir

1:17:07.861 --> 1:17:09.829
and we would go out
in the community

1:17:09.863 --> 1:17:11.798
and actually go to different
fundraising events,

1:17:11.831 --> 1:17:15.101
so St. Jude, we also support
the American Cancer Society,

1:17:15.135 --> 1:17:17.237
and we just kind of
made a point to,

1:17:17.270 --> 1:17:18.872
you know,
spread light and bring joy.

1:17:18.905 --> 1:17:20.607
Sometime--
the world needs it, so...

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:23.043
[cheering]

1:17:23.076 --> 1:17:24.844
- Wow.

1:17:24.878 --> 1:17:27.847
- I feel like
I'm in a movie right now.

1:17:27.881 --> 1:17:30.216
I love this.
I love stories like this.

1:17:30.250 --> 1:17:32.318
So why did you enter "AGT"?

1:17:32.352 --> 1:17:34.054
- Time is fleeting, y'all.

1:17:34.054 --> 1:17:36.189
If you have a dream
that you're holding on to,

1:17:36.222 --> 1:17:37.390
take the shot.

1:17:37.424 --> 1:17:40.393
[cheering]

1:17:40.427 --> 1:17:42.262
- I love these guys, man.

1:17:42.295 --> 1:17:45.565
- I mean, are you guys as
intense with your rehearsal

1:17:45.598 --> 1:17:48.768
as being in the field
and practicing?

1:17:48.802 --> 1:17:51.104
- Yeah, we're probably worse
because...

1:17:51.137 --> 1:17:52.372
- Really?
- Listen,

1:17:52.405 --> 1:17:54.507
we come from a place
that's black or white,

1:17:54.541 --> 1:17:56.343
we got to get it done.
- Yeah.

I'm kind of curious.

I just want to hear

1:20:35.201 --> 1:20:37.437
So can we do this
just a cappella?

1:20:37.470 --> 1:20:41.741
I want to just hear
that chorus without the track.

1:20:46.179 --> 1:20:47.213

All the athletes
got more than one dream.

was so much fun

1:21:48.575 --> 1:21:52.212
and I could see that
you guys were having fun.

1:21:52.245 --> 1:21:55.115
I think this is what
you guys are meant to do,

1:21:55.115 --> 1:21:56.983
and I feel that it's fantastic.

1:22:00.053 --> 1:22:02.756
I love the choir
and to also be using

1:22:02.789 --> 1:22:05.725
all of your fame
and everything for charity,

1:22:05.759 --> 1:22:07.627

that's why Simon is Simon

because he always gets
the best out of everyone.

1:22:15.135 --> 1:22:18.672
Because literally,
you all sounded so much better

1:22:18.705 --> 1:22:20.273
and not that you didn't
sound good before,

1:22:20.306 --> 1:22:23.076
but without the track
and it was just your voices,

1:22:23.076 --> 1:22:25.078
you harmonized
beautifully together.

1:22:25.111 --> 1:22:28.248

was super on point.

1:22:28.281 --> 1:22:29.716

- Yeah, look, this does happen,
you know?

1:22:35.088 --> 1:22:37.190
We do have singers,
choirs, whatever,

1:22:37.223 --> 1:22:41.094
and they come on and
the tracks just don't work.

1:22:41.094 --> 1:22:43.430
And I'm always curious,

1:22:43.463 --> 1:22:45.565
not only to hear
what you sound like

1:22:45.598 --> 1:22:49.569
but also how quickly you just
adapted in, like, five seconds.

1:22:49.602 --> 1:22:51.204
It was, like, yeah. Done.

1:22:54.874 --> 1:22:58.011
You are good singers,
and as importantly,

1:22:58.111 --> 1:23:02.082
your energy and your story
is just amazing.

1:23:02.115 --> 1:23:04.451
I really love you guys.

1:23:04.484 --> 1:23:05.518
I do.

Apart from that I like you

1:23:10.557 --> 1:23:11.658
you're competitive.

1:23:11.691 --> 1:23:13.693

of themselves?

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:08.281

- There are so many

first time you got drafted,

1:24:13.219 --> 1:24:15.755
game you suited up,
put on the uniform?

1:24:15.789 --> 1:24:17.057
You saw your number,

1:24:17.057 --> 1:24:18.591
you saw your name
on the back of that jersey,

1:24:18.625 --> 1:24:20.927
you went out,
and when you came off the field

1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:22.729
you knew you gave it your all
and your one.
