00:01.581 --> 00:03.621
Suzanne's changed.
She's a bloodsucking monster.

00:04.392 --> 00:05.671
She'll suck you dry. 
- Got you.

00:05.672 --> 00:09.672
Tyler says hi. 
- Why does he say hi?

00:11.792 --> 00:13.031
Whoa, easy.

00:13.032 --> 00:14.791
Who the hell are you? 
- I'm Harry.

00:14.792 --> 00:17.431
Just meeting you like this.

00:17.432 --> 00:20.591
I'm glad it happened.

00:20.592 --> 00:23.351
Ah! Arrrgh!

00:23.352 --> 00:27.352
Ever since I was 14, I've been
wasting these pricks.

00:27.472 --> 00:30.111
Now, one of them saved my life.

00:30.112 --> 00:31.311
Why would they do that?

00:31.312 --> 00:33.151
I couldn't let you kill Raquel.

00:33.152 --> 00:36.351
Oh, she doesn't know it yet,
but she's special.

00:36.352 --> 00:40.352
Oh, she's a real game changer.

00:43.392 --> 00:45.151
♫ I'm going to catch you

00:45.152 --> 00:47.911
♫ I'm going to get you
Get you

00:47.912 --> 00:50.231
♫ Oh, ah oh

00:50.232 --> 00:54.232
♫ I want to taste the way
that you bleed

00:54.552 --> 00:58.552
♫ Oh, oh oh-oh

00:58.712 --> 01:02.712
♫ You're my kill of the night. ♫

01:11.272 --> 01:13.511
She knows the pricks
who took Suzanne.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.871
She's going to tell us
where they're holding her.

01:15.872 --> 01:18.351
I need an ice pole.

01:18.352 --> 01:20.391
For her, because she's a demon.

01:20.392 --> 01:22.351
I can't tell who is a demon and
who isn't.

01:22.352 --> 01:26.352
What if you end up shoving something
up someone who's not a demon?

01:27.352 --> 01:28.591
That'd be awkward.

01:28.592 --> 01:30.351
OK, right, you go and wait in
the car

01:30.352 --> 01:31.871
before I shove something in you.

01:31.872 --> 01:34.831
You see someone coming in the house,
you call us.

01:34.832 --> 01:36.831
Oh, you make one joke.

01:36.832 --> 01:38.831
Fine. I'll go and wait in the car

01:38.832 --> 01:42.832
like an obedient, shitty
little puppet.

02:01.392 --> 02:05.071
Nice.

02:05.072 --> 02:08.670
Yeah, I know. You should see the art
he brings home.

02:08.672 --> 02:10.991
I've got no idea what any of it is,

02:10.991 --> 02:14.711
but it looks like he's on acid.

02:14.712 --> 02:17.271
Well, do you want to get
a coffee after drop-off?

02:17.272 --> 02:21.031
Yeah, we could go to the new place
with the cupcakes.

02:21.032 --> 02:24.111
OK, great.

02:24.112 --> 02:26.271
She didn't.

02:26.272 --> 02:30.272
Aw, no, no. No-one's pelvic floor
is what it used to be.

02:30.792 --> 02:33.871
I got hiccups the other day.

02:33.872 --> 02:35.831
Little bit of wee came out.

02:35.832 --> 02:37.951
See you tomorrow.

02:37.952 --> 02:41.952
All right, love, bye-bye.

02:42.792 --> 02:46.792
Bedtime! Yes.

02:46.832 --> 02:49.751
Mum? Who are they?

02:49.752 --> 02:51.791
They're friends of Mummy's.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.391
You say hello.

02:53.392 --> 02:55.111
Hello.

02:55.112 --> 02:56.431
You all right? 
- Hi.

02:56.432 --> 03:00.432
Why don't you let me put him to bed,
and then we can talk?

03:01.912 --> 03:05.912
Let me put him to bed and then you
can do what it is you need to do.

03:06.912 --> 03:08.871
Please?

03:08.872 --> 03:12.872
OK. Thank you.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.591
That's your muffins to take
to school tomorrow.

03:15.592 --> 03:18.391
Don't let them burn.

03:18.392 --> 03:20.711
Do you think one of you could take
his muffins out the oven?

03:20.712 --> 03:23.471
We didn't come round to help out
with your home baking.

03:23.472 --> 03:25.951
You want to hurry this along,
take the muffins out of the oven.

03:25.952 --> 03:29.311
Mum, they're going to burn, Mum.
OK, OK. Fine.

03:29.312 --> 03:33.312
I'll get the muffins. There's
a cooling tray in the oven door.

03:33.352 --> 03:35.351
Yeah, I think we're done with
the muffin talk.

03:35.352 --> 03:39.352
Your muffin days are over.

03:43.112 --> 03:44.431
Amy, you OK?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.191
I'm fine! It's just the muffins!

03:47.192 --> 03:49.191
Are my muffins burned?

03:49.192 --> 03:52.631
No. Say goodnight to Raquel.

03:52.632 --> 03:56.632
Night-night. 
- Night.

03:57.472 --> 03:59.311
Sleep tight.

03:59.312 --> 04:00.991
Mind the bedbugs don't bite,

04:00.992 --> 04:04.992
and if they do, squish them with
a big book.

04:11.432 --> 04:13.791
You listen to me, OK?

04:13.792 --> 04:17.791
No matter what you hear,
you stay in bed.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.271
How did you find me?

04:38.272 --> 04:41.791
You dropped your phone
at the ice rink.

04:41.792 --> 04:44.391
So, I guess I've got it coming
for what I did to Sawyer?

04:44.392 --> 04:46.151
You've more than got it coming.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.671
And I guarantee, it would hurt.

04:48.672 --> 04:52.551
Like... shooting a grapefruit
in reverse.

04:52.552 --> 04:55.671
But there is one way your little boy
gets to keep his mum.

04:55.672 --> 04:59.631
I'll do anything. The pricks you're
with, they took our friend.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.751
Where are they keeping her? I don't
know anything about that.

05:02.752 --> 05:05.751
But I can find out.

05:05.752 --> 05:08.392
I'll make some calls.

05:20.712 --> 05:24.712
Raquel?

05:24.752 --> 05:26.271
Raquel, you OK?

05:26.272 --> 05:27.871
I'm going to need a minute.

05:27.872 --> 05:30.151
OK, maybe more like 30.

05:30.152 --> 05:32.791
Don't you even think about
going up there on your own.

05:32.792 --> 05:35.351
She's the only way
of finding Suzanne.

05:35.352 --> 05:39.352
You don't know...

06:17.952 --> 06:21.952
I'm Sid the Snake.

06:25.672 --> 06:29.672
I'm Sid the Snake.

06:43.632 --> 06:46.791
Good try, cutie-pie.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.791
You come to my home.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.711
Where my son is.

06:50.712 --> 06:53.191
You think this is about getting
your friend back.

06:53.192 --> 06:55.991
You have no idea what's coming down
the track.

06:55.992 --> 06:59.992
A big, nasty-ass train
full of demons!

07:00.392 --> 07:03.791
Ahhh!

07:03.792 --> 07:05.551
Where's my friend?!

07:05.552 --> 07:08.191
I don't know. 
- Where is she?

07:08.192 --> 07:12.192
Where is she?! 
- Mum?

07:22.792 --> 07:29.432
Situation critical.
Over and out.

07:36.733 --> 07:39.692
The kid starts crying or does
anything even vaguely annoying,

07:39.693 --> 07:43.693
you're going to a hotel.

07:54.053 --> 07:56.052
Is he going to piss or shit himself?

07:56.053 --> 07:58.492
Because that's 800 count Egyptian
cotton.

07:58.493 --> 08:02.493
Do you want to stop being a total
dick and pour me a glass of wine?

08:03.373 --> 08:07.373
Hm.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.692
I don't think you should be on your
own.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.012
You can... stay at mine?

08:16.013 --> 08:17.852
We could have a sleepover?

08:17.853 --> 08:19.932
We'll brush each other's hair and
shit.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.972
Will your brother be there?
He's at work.

08:22.973 --> 08:26.973
He'll be back later. OK.

08:27.413 --> 08:31.413
I'll call you.

08:37.493 --> 08:41.493
Amy?

08:43.493 --> 08:47.493
I know you're probably about to go
do some heavy petting

08:48.013 --> 08:50.012
I intimate touching

08:50.013 --> 08:54.013
I oral pleasure / full penetrative
sexual intercourse,

08:55.253 --> 08:58.532
but before you do that, just give me
a chance to set out my stall,

08:58.533 --> 09:01.812
so you can make an informed choice.

09:01.813 --> 09:03.612
An informed choice?

09:03.613 --> 09:05.492
Between me and her dickhead brother.

09:05.493 --> 09:08.492
Yeah, yeah, cos he's the dickhead in
the mix.

09:08.493 --> 09:12.493
Jake... I know sometimes I can be
rude, graphically, vulgar,

09:14.613 --> 09:17.732
cock-mouthed, but my heart is pure.

09:17.733 --> 09:20.412
I'd never hurt you. I'd never shit
on you,

09:20.413 --> 09:24.413
in either the metaphorical or
literal sense of the word.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.733
I love you.

09:32.053 --> 09:35.492
So, there you go.

09:35.493 --> 09:39.452
Just putting that out there. Jake...

09:39.453 --> 09:42.732
I really like you, as a friend.

09:42.733 --> 09:46.292
It's a big decision. It's huge.

09:46.293 --> 09:49.412
Take your time.

09:49.413 --> 09:53.413
I'm sorry.

09:54.093 --> 09:58.093
Night.

09:59.573 --> 10:03.573
Nice try, man.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.972
I'll find you something to sleep in.

10:09.973 --> 10:13.132
I can't stop thinking about Suzanne.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.692
What if they've already killed her?

10:14.693 --> 10:18.212
If they wanted to kill her, they
could've done it in the forest.

10:18.213 --> 10:20.812
I still don't get why they took her
and left me.

10:20.813 --> 10:22.452
The demon single mum said something

10:22.453 --> 10:24.652
about, "big nasty-arse train
full of demons."

10:24.653 --> 10:27.092
I'm pretty sure that's not
an actual train.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.052
Well, they're not usually this
organised.

10:29.053 --> 10:31.172
We need to be ready to kick some
arse,

10:31.173 --> 10:34.932
because shit is about to get
nasty.

10:34.933 --> 10:38.933
Penguin or cow? - Penguin.
- Right.

10:41.213 --> 10:45.213
Ooh! When you went after the
she-prick on your own like that,

10:45.853 --> 10:48.892
that was very definitely kick arse.

10:48.893 --> 10:50.652
So, I'm not just a wet,

10:50.653 --> 10:53.252
delusional, shitty little princess
with a big spoon face?

10:53.253 --> 10:55.892
I think you can do better with spoon
face, but the attitude?

10:55.893 --> 10:58.492
It's a whole new you. Ooh, erm...

10:58.493 --> 11:02.493
I feel like my little girl grew a
set of balls - lady balls.

11:02.813 --> 11:05.372
That's probably the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

11:05.373 --> 11:09.373
Hm.

11:11.173 --> 11:14.372
Shall I make is some tea? Yeah, it'd
be great actually, if you could.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.532
That'd be... lovely.

11:16.533 --> 11:20.092
It's a '98 Petrus.

11:20.093 --> 11:24.093
It's really excellent.

11:26.093 --> 11:28.572
You clearly appreciate fine wine!

11:28.573 --> 11:31.932
Help yourself.

11:31.933 --> 11:34.412
Raquel came to my home.

11:34.413 --> 11:37.652
My boy was there.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.932
Do you see me losing my shit and
showing myself?

11:40.933 --> 11:43.732
No. When I feel it building up
inside,

11:43.733 --> 11:46.892
I find myself an innocent bystander
and beat them to death with my bare

11:46.893 --> 11:48.612
hands and... relax.

11:48.613 --> 11:52.613
I want to suck the life out of her
and spit her into the underworld.

11:53.773 --> 11:57.292
Well, for very obvious reasons, I
can't let that happen.

11:57.293 --> 11:59.812
You know how important she is.

11:59.813 --> 12:03.812
Why can't you just lock her in a
basement until you need her?

12:03.813 --> 12:07.813
Raquel is like a fine wine - she
needs time to develop and mature.

12:08.413 --> 12:10.692
We lock her in a basement shitting
in a bucket,

12:10.693 --> 12:13.652
she won't be in the right place
emotionally.

12:13.653 --> 12:16.412
Just chill out. "Chill out"?

12:16.413 --> 12:19.452
Chill out?!

12:19.453 --> 12:23.132
That blonde bitch tried to strangle
me, with a toy snake!

12:23.133 --> 12:25.612
I think one of your tits is
bleeding.

12:25.613 --> 12:28.052
She stabbed me with an F-15 fighter
jet.

12:28.053 --> 12:32.053
Get her - Little Miss Shit Wouldn't
Melt In My Mouth!

12:32.253 --> 12:35.612
I think it's time we remove her from
this complicated equation.

12:35.613 --> 12:37.212
She's totally ruined this bra.

12:37.213 --> 12:40.452
Well, fortunately for me, you and
your bra,

12:40.453 --> 12:42.852
I have something that she wants.

12:42.853 --> 12:46.853
I've got a lever, I just need to
pull it.

13:14.853 --> 13:17.852
Hi. Hi.

13:17.853 --> 13:20.332
I'm having a sleepover.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.572
I mean, with Raquel, in her bed with
her.

13:23.573 --> 13:26.212
OK.

13:26.213 --> 13:29.292
That's a good look for you.

13:29.293 --> 13:31.412
I didn't have anything to sleep in.

13:31.413 --> 13:32.892
Penguin or cow.

13:32.893 --> 13:35.452
Penguin! Penguin every time.

13:35.453 --> 13:37.572
Less bovine.

13:37.573 --> 13:39.172
Do you want a beer?

13:39.173 --> 13:43.173
Sure.

13:49.773 --> 13:53.773
Thanks.

13:56.373 --> 13:59.692
Should we talk? About the other
night, I mean.

13:59.693 --> 14:01.532
Do we need to?

14:01.533 --> 14:04.812
I'd like to. Really?

14:04.813 --> 14:07.732
Some things are better left unsaid.

14:07.733 --> 14:10.372
Unspoken.

14:10.373 --> 14:12.772
It's OK, I get it.

14:12.773 --> 14:14.452
You're not interested, that's fine.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.292
I wouldn't say I was totally
uninterested.

14:17.293 --> 14:19.692
So, you are interested?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.252
Define, "interested."

14:21.253 --> 14:24.332
You really need me to do that?

14:24.333 --> 14:27.132
No. I'm sorry.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.012
I'm being weird.

14:29.013 --> 14:31.772
I got a lot on my mind.

14:31.773 --> 14:35.412
It's been a weird few days.

14:35.413 --> 14:38.412
What's going on?

14:38.413 --> 14:41.292
I'm sorry, it's OK. I mean, you
don't need to tell me.

14:41.293 --> 14:45.212
It's none of my business.
It's my friend.

14:45.213 --> 14:47.772
She's sick.

14:47.773 --> 14:49.732
I'm really worried about her.

14:49.733 --> 14:53.733
I'm sorry to hear that. I've never
had to worry about her before.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.452
She could always look after herself.

14:56.453 --> 14:58.452
She's always done exactly what she
wanted.

14:58.453 --> 15:00.532
How do you mean?

15:00.533 --> 15:04.533
Well, if she likes a guy, she
makes sure they know about it.

15:07.173 --> 15:11.173
You don't? Not as a general rule,
no.

15:11.253 --> 15:13.732
You just hang around in your penguin
costume,

15:13.733 --> 15:16.052
hoping that the guy figures it out
for himself?

15:16.053 --> 15:20.053
It doesn't usually involve a penguin
onesie.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.852
Suzanne's always saying I need to
make some moves.

15:22.853 --> 15:26.853
Sounds like solid advice.

15:41.173 --> 15:43.773
Hm, they're getting jiggy.

15:55.453 --> 15:58.812
Hi. Hi.

15:58.813 --> 16:01.012
You weren't up the hill today.

16:01.013 --> 16:02.812
Erm, yeah, sorry.

16:02.813 --> 16:06.772
I had to come back to town.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.572
You should see the stars out here.

16:08.573 --> 16:10.972
It's so clear.

16:10.973 --> 16:14.973
When I'm back in town, maybe we
could meet up?

16:15.973 --> 16:19.132
Yeah, I don't know, things are kind
of crazy at the moment.

16:19.133 --> 16:22.892
It... it's just really, really bad
timing.

16:22.893 --> 16:25.852
You shared your hill with me, the
least you could do is

16:25.853 --> 16:28.932
let me buy you a drink.
One drink, a shot.

16:28.933 --> 16:30.892
But if you want to do down it and
go, that's fine.

16:30.893 --> 16:34.893
Hugely disappointing, but I'll get
over it, eventually.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.092
Do you want me to beg?

16:38.093 --> 16:42.093
OK. Really?

16:42.813 --> 16:44.852
You made me a very happy man.

16:44.853 --> 16:48.853
I'll call you. OK, bye.

16:49.973 --> 16:52.652
♫ Tell me I'm a diva

16:52.653 --> 16:54.692
♫ Take away my wings

16:54.693 --> 16:58.693
♫ I know I give you fever tonight

16:58.733 --> 17:01.812
♫ Dancing to my rhythm

17:01.813 --> 17:04.051
♫ It's time for me to shine

17:04.053 --> 17:06.412
♫ Shake it for the living

17:06.413 --> 17:08.092
♫ Shout!

17:08.093 --> 17:12.093
♫ I'm ready for the good life... ♫

17:15.252 --> 17:17.252
Where did you find him?

17:17.252 --> 17:21.252
Burger King.

17:27.772 --> 17:29.892
Sorry.

17:29.893 --> 17:33.893
So, it's OK to kidnap me and keep me
prisoner,

17:34.333 --> 17:37.172
but it's not OK to see me pissing in
a bucket?

17:37.173 --> 17:41.173
That's a fair point. I brought you a
little snack.

17:49.533 --> 17:50.892
Ah, ah!

17:50.893 --> 17:54.893
Before you chow down, there's
something I need you to do for me.

17:54.973 --> 17:58.052
No such thing as a free lunch,
right?

17:58.053 --> 18:01.332
I want you to call your little
blonde friend,

18:01.333 --> 18:02.572
tell her where you are.

18:02.573 --> 18:05.172
So, she'll try and rescue me and
then you'll kill her?

18:05.173 --> 18:08.532
Well, I like to think it's a little
more poetic and complicated than

18:08.533 --> 18:10.772
that. Did you think I was keeping
you alive

18:10.773 --> 18:14.773
for sheer entertainment value?

18:15.253 --> 18:16.812
Screw you!

18:16.813 --> 18:18.772
I won't do it!

18:18.773 --> 18:21.332
We'll see.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.892
Give her a taste.

18:22.893 --> 18:26.893
A little something to whet your
appetite, get your juices flowing.

18:29.293 --> 18:33.293
Let me know when you change your
mind.

18:47.533 --> 18:51.332
Help me!

18:51.333 --> 18:53.572
Oh, please!

18:53.573 --> 18:55.252
Please!

18:55.253 --> 18:58.653
Oh!

20:07.668 --> 20:11.668
You are one slutty little penguin.

20:12.388 --> 20:15.227
You want to tell me what's going on?
Or is this just how you roll

20:15.228 --> 20:17.747
out of bed after having sex
with my brother?

20:17.748 --> 20:19.707
Cos the sneak-out, it's not cool.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.387
I think I can see the future.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.587
You can see the future?
I don't know.

20:23.588 --> 20:25.787
I think so. It made me wet the bed.

20:25.788 --> 20:28.147
You wee-ed on my brother?
Not on him. Next to him.

20:28.148 --> 20:32.148
I couldn't be there when he woke up.
It's beyond embarrassing.

20:32.308 --> 20:36.308
It could be worse. It could have
made you go number two. God!

20:37.428 --> 20:40.267
Wanna fill me in
on what you've been seeing?

20:40.268 --> 20:42.587
I'm curiouser than a cat.

20:42.588 --> 20:45.147
The first time,
I saw Suzanne eating cheese.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.307
You saw visions of cheese?

20:47.308 --> 20:48.587
Not just cheese.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.987
I saw Suzanne running through
the woods and then it happened -

20:50.988 --> 20:52.867
I saw her running through the woods.

20:52.868 --> 20:56.387
And so you saw people eating cheese
and jogging.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.907
She wasn't jogging.
It was the exact same moment.

20:59.908 --> 21:01.627
Last night I saw a guy.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.867
He was attacking you.

21:04.868 --> 21:07.547
Who is he?
I don't know.

21:07.548 --> 21:11.507
It was like I was there but there
was nothing I could do about it.

21:11.508 --> 21:13.987
It's totally freaking me out.

21:13.988 --> 21:15.787
I can't end up like my mum.

21:15.788 --> 21:19.347
What, did she age really badly?
I hear that happens to blonde women.

21:19.348 --> 21:23.348
She said she could see the future.
I must get it from her.

21:23.828 --> 21:27.467
She wasn't as crazy
as I thought she was.

21:27.468 --> 21:31.468
Well, there's one big difference
between you...

21:31.788 --> 21:34.547
and your mum. Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

21:34.548 --> 21:38.107
Your mum never had me, dumb-arse.

21:38.108 --> 21:40.347
Right, come on. Hug it out.

21:40.348 --> 21:42.547
Come on. Come get it.

21:42.548 --> 21:44.707
Come get some Raquel love.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.907
Come get it. Come get it.
Come get it. Come get it.

21:47.908 --> 21:51.908
Come get it.

21:52.268 --> 21:55.827
♫ Got the devil's disease

21:55.828 --> 21:59.587
♫ I've got the jealous in me

21:59.588 --> 22:03.507
♫ So to the jail I plead

22:03.508 --> 22:07.508
♫ He put the devil in me

22:07.788 --> 22:11.627
♫ When he said he would leave

22:11.628 --> 22:13.907
♫ Don't let it end like this

22:13.908 --> 22:16.187
♫ Without my kiss

22:16.188 --> 22:19.027
♫ Oh, and you go

22:19.028 --> 22:21.987
♫ You walk out on me, baby

22:21.988 --> 22:25.387
♫ And leave me for another lady

22:25.388 --> 22:27.307
♫ You are

22:27.308 --> 22:31.308
♫ You are the devil in me. ♫

22:33.628 --> 22:35.707
Seriously?

22:35.708 --> 22:38.427
It looks like they're pouring out
of her lady hole.

22:38.428 --> 22:41.147
I thought that was the obvious
place. You think it should be

22:41.148 --> 22:44.987
her arsehole? No, I do not think
it should be her arsehole!

22:44.988 --> 22:47.147
Does it have to be so...

22:47.148 --> 22:49.107
anatomical?

22:49.108 --> 22:51.147
She's a gateway.

22:51.148 --> 22:53.947
It's a metaphor.
OK.

22:53.948 --> 22:56.547
I'll do it.

22:56.548 --> 22:59.267
We can change the design
of the flyer.

22:59.268 --> 23:03.267
We have already printed the backdrop
at the party venue.

23:03.268 --> 23:07.268
Are you hearing me?
I said I'll do it. I'm coming!

23:07.548 --> 23:09.387
I swear to God,

23:09.388 --> 23:12.467
sometimes I feel like just
fucking off to the Seychelles

23:12.468 --> 23:16.468
and just forgetting
this entire thing!

23:16.748 --> 23:20.748
Right, come on, you, twinkle toes.

23:27.148 --> 23:28.907
Hi.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.387
Hi.

23:31.388 --> 23:33.067
Well, awkward.

23:33.068 --> 23:35.947
I'm going to get changed.
Kind of ridiculous...

23:35.948 --> 23:39.947
walking around... dressed as a cow.

23:39.948 --> 23:42.587
Move, numb nuts.

23:42.588 --> 23:46.588
Thank you.

23:47.228 --> 23:50.107
So I woke up this morning
and you weren't there.

23:50.108 --> 23:51.587
I wasn't sure what to think.

23:51.588 --> 23:53.707
I was just... having a cup of tea.

23:53.708 --> 23:57.708
Right. Well, I just want to say
that...

23:58.468 --> 24:00.987
...it's OK, don't worry about it.

24:00.988 --> 24:03.267
The bedding. 
- Yeah...

24:03.268 --> 24:06.547
I'm sorry about that.

24:06.548 --> 24:08.947
That only happens
when it's really good.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.987
Really? I made you...?

24:10.988 --> 24:12.627
Oh, yeah.

24:12.628 --> 24:15.787
Big-time.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.107
Well, it was good for me, too.

24:19.108 --> 24:20.308
It was great.

24:21.788 --> 24:25.627
Sorry.

24:25.628 --> 24:27.827
Hello?
- Amy?

24:27.828 --> 24:30.067
It's me.
- Suzanne, where are you?

24:30.068 --> 24:33.627
I don't know. They're keeping me
in some old factory.

24:33.628 --> 24:35.547
Can you see anything
with an address on it?

24:35.548 --> 24:39.548
It's a letter.
83 Smith St, top floor.

24:40.068 --> 24:44.068
They're coming. Amy...

24:44.548 --> 24:46.907
Nicely done.

24:46.908 --> 24:48.787
Very convincing.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.107
I'd believe you. Suzanne?

24:51.108 --> 24:55.108
Suzanne?!

24:58.148 --> 25:02.148
Deal's a deal, right?

25:06.268 --> 25:08.467
No! You said I could feed!

25:08.468 --> 25:12.468
You'll feed soon enough.

25:12.668 --> 25:16.668
Cross my heart.

25:19.388 --> 25:22.667
OK, I have to go to the party venue,
see about this backdrop.

25:22.668 --> 25:24.627
Can you believe this shit?

25:24.628 --> 25:26.867
Gates of hell equals vagina.

25:26.868 --> 25:29.547
It says a lot about the guy.

25:29.548 --> 25:33.548
What should I do with him?

25:43.868 --> 25:47.868
Shouldn't have gone to Burger King.

25:53.028 --> 25:55.907
♫ I had me a boy,
turned him into a man

25:55.908 --> 25:58.827
♫ I showed him all the things
that he didn't understand

25:58.828 --> 26:01.787
♫ Whoa-oa

26:01.788 --> 26:05.788
♫ Then I let him go... ♫

26:08.148 --> 26:11.587
You don't have to say anything.
I can tell.

26:11.588 --> 26:15.387
It's all in the eyes.
And between her thighs.

26:15.388 --> 26:18.787
That's fine. It's a woman's right
to choose...

26:18.788 --> 26:20.267
badly.

26:20.268 --> 26:23.267
I respect that.

26:23.268 --> 26:25.867
It's interesting, though.

26:25.868 --> 26:27.507
I said it's very interesting.

26:27.508 --> 26:31.508
What's that? Well...
you spend the night with him

26:31.748 --> 26:35.748
but it's me you call when the shit's
about to start flying.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.907
Hitting fans and splattering faces.

26:38.908 --> 26:40.587
Give it time.

26:40.588 --> 26:44.588
These feelings have to run both ways
otherwise it's just like...

26:45.828 --> 26:49.027
...masturbating into naan bread.

26:49.028 --> 26:52.947
Why naan bread?

26:52.948 --> 26:55.347
Had an Indian takeaway last night.

26:55.348 --> 26:57.027
Some leftovers.

26:57.028 --> 27:01.028
Seemed a shame to waste it.

27:02.988 --> 27:06.427
♫ And the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me

27:06.428 --> 27:09.547
♫ Like gho-o-osts they want me

27:09.548 --> 27:11.827
♫ To make 'em all, all, all

27:11.828 --> 27:14.427
♫ They won't let go

27:14.428 --> 27:18.428
♫ Ex's and oh's... ♫

27:25.188 --> 27:27.707
I saw this building.

27:27.708 --> 27:30.107
You really can see the future?

27:30.108 --> 27:34.108
What? Seriously? She's half-demon
and you can see the future?

27:35.868 --> 27:38.987
Suddenly I'm feeling incredibly
boring and inadequate.

27:38.988 --> 27:42.988
You think I like it? You have
no idea how lucky you are.

27:54.028 --> 27:58.028
Suzanne says they're holding her
on the top floor.

27:58.908 --> 28:02.587
Sorry. Sometimes I wish someone
would just shove something

28:02.588 --> 28:04.827
in my mouth just to shut me up.

28:04.828 --> 28:07.267
Like a dick. 
- No.

28:07.268 --> 28:09.667
Like a banana.
- Something dick-shaped, then.

28:09.668 --> 28:13.668
An apple or a pear is fine.

28:22.748 --> 28:23.947
Bitch.

28:23.948 --> 28:25.148
Raquel!

28:27.668 --> 28:29.227
Suzanne.

28:29.228 --> 28:33.228
Get Raquel. Go!

28:39.228 --> 28:41.507
Are you OK? I was so worried
about you.

28:41.508 --> 28:43.947
You shouldn't have come.
I couldn't leave you here.

28:43.948 --> 28:46.987
You wouldn't leave me. Come on.

28:46.988 --> 28:50.988
Suzanne, we have to go.

28:53.268 --> 28:57.268
Shit. She's gone. Come on!

29:01.148 --> 29:05.148
They're coming. Let's go.

29:05.428 --> 29:07.347
Suzanne, get in.

29:07.348 --> 29:09.307
I can't.
What are you talking about?

29:09.308 --> 29:11.067
I haven't fed.

29:11.068 --> 29:15.068
Suzanne, get in. You'll feed
really soon, I promise.

29:24.948 --> 29:28.948
Just hold on. A few more seconds
and we'll be out of here.

29:41.108 --> 29:45.108
Hit it.

29:52.468 --> 29:56.468
No.

30:01.828 --> 30:05.787
They told me to do it.

30:05.788 --> 30:09.227
They made me call you.

30:09.228 --> 30:13.228
They said they'd feed me.

30:18.628 --> 30:22.628
I'm so sorry.

30:42.628 --> 30:44.148
Amy?

30:47.708 --> 30:50.987
Where are you?
I'm with Suzanne.

30:50.988 --> 30:54.387
We're in the lift.

30:54.388 --> 30:57.027
It's stuck.

30:57.028 --> 31:00.468
Ah...

31:36.059 --> 31:40.059
I don't think I can fight this
any longer.

31:47.259 --> 31:49.618
Hey!

31:49.619 --> 31:52.738
Do you remember when we were eight,

31:52.739 --> 31:56.739
and Matt Lee pulled my knickers down
when we were changing for PE?

31:58.499 --> 32:02.499
You kicked the shit out of that
little pervert!

32:03.539 --> 32:07.539
You said, "I'll never let anyone
hurt you."

32:08.819 --> 32:11.418
And you've never let anyone hurt me.

32:11.419 --> 32:15.419
Ever.

32:20.099 --> 32:23.178
Oh, this isn't me!

32:23.179 --> 32:25.978
Suzanne, Suzanne, Suzanne!

32:25.979 --> 32:27.618
Everything we've done,

32:27.619 --> 32:30.818
everything we've been through
together.

32:30.819 --> 32:34.819
I don't care how hungry you are,
you're my best friend.

32:36.259 --> 32:40.259
I've got you.

32:45.859 --> 32:47.658
Amy!

32:47.659 --> 32:49.098
Raquel, get us out of here!

32:49.099 --> 32:52.818
Amy! Amy!

32:52.819 --> 32:56.819
Amy!

33:07.179 --> 33:11.179
I won't let the pricks
do this to us.

33:11.659 --> 33:15.258
We're better than them.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.019
I have to feed. No.

33:20.179 --> 33:22.578
What we have...

33:22.579 --> 33:26.178
...can't end like this.

33:26.179 --> 33:30.179
I won't let it.

33:42.379 --> 33:44.658
Do it.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.419
Amy?

34:24.379 --> 34:27.458
I love you.

34:27.458 --> 34:29.579
I can't live this way.

34:31.619 --> 34:35.619
No!

34:39.739 --> 34:41.737
My God, Amy!

34:41.739 --> 34:44.138
Oh, my God, I thought you were...
- You're bleeding.

34:44.139 --> 34:46.178
I cut myself so Suzanne could feed.

34:46.179 --> 34:50.179
Well, where is she?

34:56.179 --> 35:00.179
MUSIC: Goodnight Bad Morning
by The Kills

35:02.979 --> 35:06.979
Oh...

35:08.539 --> 35:12.539
Oh.

35:14.499 --> 35:18.499
Oh, my God.

35:23.899 --> 35:27.899
Ah, OK.

35:28.619 --> 35:32.619
Ugh...

35:39.859 --> 35:43.859
Is she dead?

35:44.219 --> 35:46.098
It's horrible.

35:46.099 --> 35:47.578
Did you check for a pulse?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.218
The undead don't die so easily.

35:49.219 --> 35:50.978
A pulse? Yeah.

35:50.979 --> 35:53.498
Her body was here and
her head was somewhere over there,

35:53.499 --> 35:56.338
and she didn't grow
a really long neck.

35:56.339 --> 35:59.218
You are more than welcome to go
check for yourself.

35:59.219 --> 36:03.219
♫ Goodnight another bad morning... ♫

36:15.419 --> 36:19.299
So sorry.

36:22.139 --> 36:25.258
You'd have to say that wasn't
a total success.

36:25.259 --> 36:27.818
Really?

36:27.819 --> 36:31.819
That little blonde bitch could
seriously screw up our plans.

36:31.859 --> 36:35.538
You think opening
the gates of Hell is easy?

36:35.539 --> 36:39.539
You can't just give them a little
push and Bob's your uncle!

36:39.779 --> 36:41.618
I swear to God,

36:41.619 --> 36:44.818
if I make it through Halloween
without having a stroke

36:44.819 --> 36:47.898
it's going to be a miracle.

36:47.899 --> 36:50.018
You clean that mess up

36:50.019 --> 36:53.418
and I will try and get our
incredibly complicated plan

36:53.419 --> 36:57.098
back on track, huh?

36:57.099 --> 36:58.978
You think you can manage that?

36:58.979 --> 37:02.979
We're all over it.

37:17.459 --> 37:19.178
I feel better.

37:19.179 --> 37:23.179
Well, you can't bottle
these things up, you know?

37:23.699 --> 37:27.699
It's not healthy.

37:34.739 --> 37:38.739
We should jet wash these guys off
the pavement.

37:41.059 --> 37:45.058
It was my turn to look out for her.

37:45.059 --> 37:47.338
I screwed it up.

37:47.339 --> 37:48.858
Don't say that.

37:48.859 --> 37:52.458
Sometimes there's nothing
you can do.

37:52.459 --> 37:55.178
I couldn't stop them killing my dad.

37:55.179 --> 37:56.938
This shit isn't on us.

37:56.939 --> 37:58.698
There is something we can do -

37:58.699 --> 38:01.458
we can find them
and we can waste them.

38:01.459 --> 38:02.698
I know you're upset,

38:02.699 --> 38:05.818
but you're not going to go all
psycho on me, are you?

38:05.819 --> 38:07.338
No.

38:07.339 --> 38:11.339
Going to go psycho on them.

38:12.259 --> 38:15.418
Going to all that trouble with
Suzanne, I mean,

38:15.419 --> 38:17.138
they really want to take you out.

38:17.139 --> 38:21.139
Why? Think it's because of me.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.658
My dad tried to warn me.

38:23.659 --> 38:27.659
He said there's a real nasty prick
out there.

38:30.659 --> 38:33.778
♫ We wake up tired

38:33.779 --> 38:37.779
♫ We wake up tired again

38:42.579 --> 38:45.738
♫ We wake up tired

38:45.739 --> 38:49.739
♫ My head is in your hands... ♫

38:58.019 --> 38:59.698
Thanks for letting me stay.

38:59.699 --> 39:02.058
Being in the flat without Suzanne...

39:02.059 --> 39:06.058
It's cool.
You can stay as long as you want.

39:06.059 --> 39:10.059
I always wanted to share my bed with
a crazy seeing-the-future lady.

39:11.219 --> 39:12.898
Not crazy.

39:12.899 --> 39:14.338
Gifted.

39:14.339 --> 39:17.898
And I always wanted to share a bed
with a potty-mouthed half demon.

39:17.899 --> 39:21.898
If we were gay, we'd be the world's
freakiest lesbian couple.

39:21.899 --> 39:24.458
Probably get some kind of prize.

39:24.459 --> 39:27.018
Are you going out?

39:27.019 --> 39:28.938
It's Pilates.

39:28.939 --> 39:31.098
You mind if I go? No, you should.

39:31.099 --> 39:33.738
You sure? I mean, I... Go.

39:33.739 --> 39:37.739
OK. I'll see you later.

39:43.779 --> 39:46.898
♫ Every night you've got to save me

39:46.899 --> 39:49.778
♫ Every night you've got to save me

39:49.779 --> 39:52.938
♫ Every night

39:52.939 --> 39:56.939
♫ Every night... ♫

39:57.899 --> 40:00.818
Hi.

40:00.819 --> 40:04.819
Hi.

40:05.819 --> 40:09.819
Are you turning round, or do I just
talk to your reflection?

40:12.379 --> 40:16.379
I'm turning.

40:17.299 --> 40:19.498
Hi. 
- Hi.

40:19.499 --> 40:23.499
So, I think we've covered hi.

40:23.579 --> 40:25.538
You look great.

40:25.539 --> 40:28.138
Shut your face, idiot.

40:28.139 --> 40:32.058
I did some brawly shit today.

40:32.059 --> 40:34.458
 He's not so good -
his cat got run over.

40:34.459 --> 40:38.459
 Cat-murdering bitch.
It was a girlfriend.

40:55.699 --> 40:59.699
Raquel! Raquel!

41:07.179 --> 41:11.179
Sorry...

41:13.019 --> 41:15.098
He's the guy!
The guy you got in the car with,

41:15.099 --> 41:17.858
he's the guy I saw attacking you!

41:17.859 --> 41:21.859
You have to get away from him!
Just get away from him!

41:22.179 --> 41:26.179
Call me.

41:44.899 --> 41:48.898
Is that Beyonce? It's Raquel.

41:48.899 --> 41:52.899
Guess that makes more sense,
cos she's a local.

42:08.219 --> 42:09.858
♫ I'm gonna catch ya

42:09.859 --> 42:12.698
♫ I'm gonna get ya, get ya

42:12.699 --> 42:15.218
♫ Oh, ah, oh

42:15.219 --> 42:19.219
♫ I wanna taste the way
that you bleed

42:19.339 --> 42:23.339
♫ Oh

42:24.019 --> 42:26.858
♫ You're my kill of the night. ♫
