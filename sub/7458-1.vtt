00:54.920 --> 00:57.070
SAT.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.670
Suck-Ass Test.
That's what that stands for.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.348
This is the SAT1 examination.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.597
For the first section,
you have 30 minutes.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.873
Last year, two million kids
took the Suck-Ass Test

01:11.080 --> 01:13.071
in order to get to college.

01:13.280 --> 01:17.671
Scores ranged from 500, you're going
to community college riding a bus,

01:17.880 --> 01:21.429
to 1600, you're lvy League
driving a Porsche.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.833
It's a standardised test, "standardised"
meaning they see us all the same.

01:28.040 --> 01:33.034
A kid is a kid is a kid.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.033
Take this kid, for instance, Kyle.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.516
He's a good guy who knows
where he wants to go in life,

01:41.720 --> 01:45.554
but for now the SAT's
standing in the way of Kyle's dream.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.149
It's telling him, "You're just..."

01:50.120 --> 01:51.997
Time.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.670
Then there's Anna, the overachiever.
You know the type.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.270
A future PhD with a nice A-S-S.

02:09.639 --> 02:14.760
Good deeds, good grades,
but the SAT doesn't care about that.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.670
You could be the class brain,
a kid in the middle or dumb as a post.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.158
When you walk into this room,
it's not about who you are.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.913
The SAT is about who you'll be.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.718
It's a 1020, Mr Dooling.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.597
Well, I've seen worse.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.917
I need a 1430. I've applied to Cornell.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.119
What are your fallback schools?

02:58.320 --> 03:01.198
I don't have any.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.277
It's kinda risky, isn't it?

03:03.480 --> 03:07.109
I'm looking at your file here,
and while your GPA is strong,

03:07.320 --> 03:11.632
your PSAT score wasn't so great.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.992
Don't you think that 1430 is a little bit...

03:16.200 --> 03:20.591
Mr Dooling, when I was seven,
I built a log cabin out of Popsicle sticks.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.678
Five of the first six kids you talk to

03:23.880 --> 03:28.271
are not gonna have a clue
what they wanna do with their lives.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.677
I've known since I was seven.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.394
I wanna be an architect.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.197
As soon as I realised there's one school
that turns out the greatest architects,

03:41.400 --> 03:44.392
I've wanted to go there.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.592
- Cornell University.
- Cornell?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.316
The guy who designed our bus barn,

03:51.520 --> 03:55.832
he attended a community college
just down the street.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.558
Dooling said you couldn't do it?

04:02.760 --> 04:05.194
That's Matty, Kyle's right-hand man.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.109
They say misery loves company.
Well, it really loves Matty.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.153
He said standardised testing
says I can't do it.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.319
You're down to a 1020? Jesus!
That's almost as bad as me, man.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.432
- What'd you tell your parents?
- What do you think?

04:21.800 --> 04:24.633
We've never been so proud, son.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.477
It's good.

04:30.880 --> 04:35.078
143. That's what I scored.
Remember, Mom?

04:38.040 --> 04:42.795
Well, look at the positives.
At least one of us is going to college.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.758
Hello, Maryland.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.555
Matty's girlfriend Sandy
is a freshman at Maryland,

04:50.760 --> 04:54.639
and he was now moments away
from hooking up with her in the fall.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.196
- Open the letter, Matty.
- Yeah, you're right.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.188
Why should the fact
that you're screwed ruin my big day?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.839
Oh, shit!

05:11.960 --> 05:14.235
SAT score insufficient!

05:14.440 --> 05:17.477
This shit ain't fair.
Sandy's gonna be crushed.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.989
Do you even know what SAT stands for?

05:20.200 --> 05:23.954
- Suck-Ass Test?
- Scholastic Aptitude Test.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.436
Then they got rid of that.
Know what it stands for now?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.433
SAT.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.076
- What?
- SAT stands for SAT. That's it.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.558
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah, I know.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.875
Sever All Ties. SAT.

05:45.080 --> 05:50.791
I may as well sever all ties with Sandy.
There's gotta be somebody to talk to.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.358
- There's no one we can talk to?
- All the kids wanna go up to ETS.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.233
If one goes up, they all go up.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.798
What about her?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.833
Unless your father owns the building...

06:12.160 --> 06:15.072
- We'll take the test again.
- It's in two weeks.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.115
There's no time to get ready, and even
if there was, what's gonna change?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.276
I'd better call Sandy.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.957
She's gonna love this.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.757
Yeah, Sandy's room.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.272
- Some guy answered.
- Room-mate's boyfriend.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.313
- He said, "Sandy's room."
- So?

06:41.520 --> 06:45.752
So, her room-mate's Pam.
He'd say Pam's room, not Sandy's room.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.316
- Pam's room. Pam.
- All right, Matty.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.478
- You're wired. It's the Red Bull.
- No.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.878
The SAT did this.
The SAT is pimping out my girlfriend.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.677
Damn it!

07:03.600 --> 07:06.910
We gotta do something.
They're messing with our lives.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.396
The college board
made millions of dollars last year.

07:10.600 --> 07:15.151
- You think they give a shit about us?
- Hear me out. I'm not a dumb guy.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.399
I know things. Ask me who's got
the best pitching staff in baseball.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.195
Or ask me how to rebuild
a carburettor on a '71 Buick.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.949
- Ask me what icing is, for Christ's sake.
- Make the point.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.597
Where the hell's that on the test?
You learn the rest in college.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.759
I show up for a job interview
with a science geek and a math nerd.

07:35.960 --> 07:41.114
Who's gonna get the job? The guy
who can throw down at the water cooler.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.949
The guy who yakked in your Cutlass
after the Radiohead show.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.597
- Me. That's me. I get the job.
- I'm still seeing no point.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.715
The point is that they are not playing fair.
Why should we?

07:54.920 --> 07:58.629
We know where the answers are. ETS.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.717
Maybe we should borrow them.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.874
You wanna steal the answers
to the SAT?

08:07.080 --> 08:11.710
You have a talent. What you can do
with a pencil and paper, I could never do.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.230
- But you're never gonna pass.
- A lot of kids struggle.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.557
- That doesn't justify thievery.
- No?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.354
Did you see my dad's truck
in the driveway?

08:21.560 --> 08:24.870
It's the one with the large crapper
on top of it.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.799
It doesn't say, "Matthews Septic" on it.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.356
It says, "Matthews & Son Septic" on it.

08:31.560 --> 08:36.270
If I don't get into Maryland,
my life is shit. Literally.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.755
And it's not even my own shit.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.395
Kyle. Dude, check this out.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.909
Listen. This is great. Watch this.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.873
Thank you, Princeton, New Jersey!

09:02.000 --> 09:03.831
Smoke On The Water.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.710
You hear that?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.677
I'm worried about you, Kyle.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.953
You're gonna try to regain this lost
youth and head into a shit-pit.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.914
That what you're doing?
Living at home, jamming with the dryer?

09:20.120 --> 09:24.796
I don't live at home. I live above the
garage. It's a whole separate dwelling.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.878
I've got my own phone line.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.878
Hey, honey.
Wanna help me grade assignments?

09:31.080 --> 09:34.629
- We're teaching the kids to bubble in.
- First graders?

09:35.760 --> 09:38.149
Most of these kids can't even read yet.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.316
Well, I hate to say it,

09:40.520 --> 09:45.435
but there's more money for the school
in bubbling in than reading these days.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.154
Now he gets it.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.237
Just follow the money.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.949
Standardised testing is taking over,

09:54.160 --> 09:56.993
and it starts long before high school.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.469
Test scores go up,
the schools get more cash.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.394
In some cases,
even the teachers get paid.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.955
It's enough to piss you off.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.153
I mean, when you get the feeling
that everything's slipping away,

10:23.360 --> 10:25.351
that you're gonna be left behind,

10:25.560 --> 10:29.348
desperate times
call for desperate measures.

10:35.960 --> 10:41.557
Hey, Matty, if you wanted to borrow
the answers, how would you do it?

10:41.760 --> 10:45.355
The girl at ETS,
the one the guard let pass...

10:46.920 --> 10:48.797
...you recognise her?

10:50.160 --> 10:52.469
Francesca Curtis.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.557
The web-page girl?

10:56.880 --> 10:59.348
Francesca Curtis.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.233
Talk about your forbidden fruit.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.114
Hey.

11:17.320 --> 11:22.235
Do you guys know the name
of that kid with the Percocet addiction?

11:22.440 --> 11:24.158
No? No?

11:25.600 --> 11:30.230
If you have something for my page,
write it down and slip it in my locker.

11:30.440 --> 11:35.992
Get back to you. If you don't know where
it is, you're in way over your heads.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.078
Actually, we had something else in mind.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.957
So you guys are gonna steal
the SAT answers?

11:57.160 --> 12:03.759
You should. It's anti-girl, it's anti... a lot
of shit, but it definitely has girl issues.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.713
It underscores us
on the math and verbal.

12:06.920 --> 12:12.631
The college board settled a complaint
that the PSAT had a testicle bias.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.876
So you'll help us, then?

12:15.920 --> 12:18.354
- No.
- Why not?

12:18.560 --> 12:21.518
You and Dawson can't pull it off.
Do you have a plan?

12:21.720 --> 12:24.029
We're working on it.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.470
OK. You're wasting my time.

12:27.400 --> 12:32.155
Don't you find it ridiculous that they
tell us to be unique, to be individuals,

12:32.360 --> 12:37.275
then they give us a standardised test
that makes us all one faceless herd?

12:39.760 --> 12:41.512
Desmond Rhodes, superstar!

12:43.520 --> 12:49.595
Wait. $100 million a year, probably
60 million of that from girls alone,

12:49.800 --> 12:53.918
to pick up a few stones
to throw at a bully that doesn't fight fair?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.271
How many girls
are gonna get screwed by this test?

12:57.480 --> 13:01.632
What's that gonna do to their
self-esteem, on top of everything else?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.798
- You're preaching to the converted.
- I know.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.072
That's why we approached you.
We need your help.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.838
What the hell? It sounds like fun.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.597
I told you.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.318
Desmond Rhodes, superstar!

13:29.520 --> 13:34.514
Desmond Rhodes, All-City,
but his grades are shitty.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.878
What do you think?

13:40.080 --> 13:44.198
I look good in red. I was thinking
a Philadelphia 76ers red, though.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.188
Is that why you haven't taken
the SATs yet, the pros?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.674
Maybe.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.190
- May I speak honestly?
- Please, I wish you would.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.512
Des, I want you to come to St John's,

13:59.720 --> 14:03.872
because the fact of the matter is,
your game is not ready.

14:04.960 --> 14:10.398
If you come with me, I'll do everything
in my power to get you to the NBA.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.273
But if, God forbid, you don't make it,

14:13.480 --> 14:18.838
you're gonna have a degree in one hand
and be prepared for life after basketball.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.873
Now, you see,
that's what I'm talking about.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.279
- So where do we go from here?
- Well, that's up to you.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.474
You know, your grade point average
is a little bit on the low end for St John's,

14:32.680 --> 14:35.194
but we can work with that.

14:35.400 --> 14:40.235
What you need is 900 or better
on the SATs.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.112
- Hey, Matty, don't freak out, OK?
- About what?

14:51.320 --> 14:53.959
- Just don't.
- I won't. What's up?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.477
What are you doing?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.234
You remember
the photographer at the game,

15:02.440 --> 15:05.637
the girl on the baseline?

15:15.160 --> 15:18.197
- You told Anna Ross?
- You said you wouldn't freak.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.790
- Before I knew you told the class brain.
- Yeah, well...

15:22.000 --> 15:25.675
I'm sorry, Matty. Maybe we're not
the only ones in this boat.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.394
- What boat? It's Anna Ross!
- I know.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.312
What did she say?

15:33.520 --> 15:37.798
You know, I don't even know you,
but even if I did,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.230
what you're talking about is wrong.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.432
- It's cheating.
- It's a victimless crime.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.871
OK. Hypothetical situation.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.676
You're driving. It's late. You get
to a red light in the middle of nowhere.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.075
Do you run the light?

15:54.840 --> 15:57.912
You see? You don't. You wait.

15:58.120 --> 16:02.159
Because a victimless crime
is still a crime. It isn't worth it.

16:02.360 --> 16:06.194
Maybe it is. Maybe I run it. It depends.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.277
On what?

16:09.600 --> 16:12.068
Am I trying to get somewhere important?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.270
- So she's in?
- She said no.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.755
Yeah, but she knows about it.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.716
- You like this girl?
- Matt...

16:22.920 --> 16:25.832
No, if you're trying to get into her pants...

16:26.040 --> 16:29.635
It wasn't like that. I just got the feeling...

16:29.840 --> 16:33.196
Something just tells me
she needs this as bad as we do.

16:33.400 --> 16:38.155
OK. Something tells you
just to walk up to Anna Ross

16:38.360 --> 16:42.831
and invite her to break in to ETS
to steal the answers to the SAT?

16:43.040 --> 16:46.589
- Some inner voice signed off on this?
- Yeah, it did, Matt.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.995
That is great, Kyle.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.271
Hey, that's me.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.717
Just because they keep getting younger
doesn't mean you will.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.712
Here she is. The game ran late, honey?

17:42.920 --> 17:45.718
- Anna's the yearbook photographer.
- A little.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.515
This is Tom, an old friend,
who might be able to help with Brown.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.678
Hi, Anna. It's a pleasure to meet you.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.838
Come on, honey. Sit down.
Let me get that.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.713
- It's just her camera gear.
- Sweetheart.

17:58.920 --> 18:02.435
So, great, great.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.315
So, Anna, what are you interested in
besides photography?

18:08.520 --> 18:11.671
Tell him about the pledge drive
you coordinated.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.555
We asked students to sign a pledge
to refrain from drug use...

18:15.760 --> 18:18.877
- It was very successful.
- That's great.

18:19.080 --> 18:24.791
She's also involved in several other
community-related projects...

18:31.240 --> 18:33.800
Hey, kiddo. That went well.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.435
I guess we won.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.074
Yep, they did.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.513
Your father and I have noticed the effort
you've put in to this re-test.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.553
- What if I mess it up again?
- You won't.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.876
You're gonna do great.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.435
We're really proud of you, honey.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.830
Hi, who's this?

19:09.040 --> 19:13.875
Cleo. I think I dialled the wrong number,
but you sound familiar.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.992
What's your Thursday morning class?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.668
ME lecture? Mine, too.

19:19.880 --> 19:22.030
Yeah.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.800
Listen, I won't keep you any longer.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.675
Before you go, my room-mates and I
are having this discussion.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.757
Maybe you can help.

19:30.960 --> 19:36.671
What's the lowest SAT score you've ever
heard of anyone who's got into Brown?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.277
Thanks.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.516
- ETS has the entire top floor.
- Can you get us up there?

19:57.720 --> 20:00.314
Well, probably, but then what?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.915
We're not talking about a big heist.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.636
It's getting in, finding the answers,
making a copy and getting out.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.310
We just gotta think
of the easiest way to do it.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.955
- You've assembled a crack team.
- What was I supposed to do?

20:26.160 --> 20:28.196
He knows everything. He'd bust us.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.675
So does Anna Ross, but she's not here.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.873
- You told Anna Ross?
- Yeah. He had a feeling about her.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.913
Was the feeling
anywhere near your crotch?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.157
Hey, guys. I have an idea.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.310
The mailroom services the building.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.910
They hire a lot of guys
straight out of high school.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.271
They won't know you.
Just act like you own the place.

20:57.480 --> 21:01.109
- Easy for you to say. You do.
- Wanna know what we're up against?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.197
You'll be fine.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.796
- Cornell still worth it?
- Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.309
- Sandy?
- Yeah.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.034
- Good.
- 'Cause we're in it now.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.277
Can I help you?

21:32.680 --> 21:37.959
These are the new mailroom slaves.
You guys forgot your badges.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.993
Losers! Let's go. Pay attention.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.630
- What are you doing here?
- Other than bailing you out?

21:50.840 --> 21:54.549
- How did you get in here?
- I'm the ghost, man.

21:54.760 --> 21:59.914
By the way, just so you know,
mail pickup was this morning.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.035
- Waiting till the last minute, huh?
- Hey.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.754
Take a look at that.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.318
Nice. Thanks.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.878
- You think you could help me with that?
- Photography?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.957
No, that.

22:47.440 --> 22:51.194
- No, I can't.
- Come on, Anna. For me?

22:51.400 --> 22:54.870
You ever heard of the term
"stereotype vulnerability"?

22:55.080 --> 22:59.756
Some students do badly on the SAT
because they know they're expected to.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.110
I'll tell you something about that.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.756
If you mess up on the SAT test,
you gotta live with it.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.520
If I do, I gotta read about it
in USA Today.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.156
"Desmond Rhodes is a dumb-ass."

23:12.360 --> 23:14.555
You know, just because I play ball,

23:14.760 --> 23:18.309
teachers have been lettin' me
slide through since for ever.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.196
I'm not trying to say it's their fault,
'cause it's not. I did what I did.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.949
If there was some way
I could just get around this thing...

23:29.040 --> 23:33.113
It all means more to me now,
that's all I'm trying to say.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.076
Excuse me.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.995
Who are you?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.873
Who am I? Who are you?

23:48.080 --> 23:50.435
This is my office.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.631
Ah, yeah.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.400
I'm from the mailroom.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.319
Well, do you have something for me?

23:59.560 --> 24:01.790
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.594
Well, could you give it to me?

24:04.800 --> 24:07.155
Yes, I can.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.589
My bad. Let me get that for you.

24:18.600 --> 24:23.037
Anything else I can do for you
while I'm down here?

24:33.160 --> 24:35.230
Hey, you.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.194
- Copy room, right?
- Right.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.551
Great. I need two copies of this on rush.

24:42.760 --> 24:48.517
One comes back to me, one to Ann
Clark and the master to 510 for filing.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.631
- Sure.
- Great.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.677
- What are you doing?
- Casing the joint.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.638
Thank you.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.789
If we take it, they might get suspicious.
They could change it by next Saturday.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.677
Copy it.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.635
Say hello to your future, Matty.

25:40.640 --> 25:45.475
- Septic And Toilets. SAT.
- Come on, man. It was a good run.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.477
What run? There was no run.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.433
Yeah, well, whatever it was, it's over.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.157
Francesca was right. We were screwed.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.713
Well, at least she didn't bring the cops.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.069
Or maybe not.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.833
If I wanted to do what we talked about...

26:13.320 --> 26:15.356
...would you need to know why?

26:15.560 --> 26:19.348
No, but I don't think
it's gonna be possible now.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.396
Can I ask you something?

26:24.600 --> 26:28.354
- Why'd you bail in your exam?
- I didn't.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.552
I saw your answer sheet.
It was practically blank.

26:36.200 --> 26:42.150
I was doing fine at first.
Then I came to a story question.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.158
A woman boards a train
in New York at midnight.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.673
Three hours later a man also boards.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.519
For some reason, I couldn't get past it.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.395
Where was this woman going?
Why was she alone?

26:56.600 --> 27:00.798
I know it probably sounds crazy,
but it just hit home for me.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.074
I wanted to be on that train
and just be gone somewhere.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.993
I guess I just froze.

27:13.040 --> 27:18.558
When I got home, I realised
how disappointed my parents would be.

27:18.760 --> 27:23.117
I need to do great on this test.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.436
Yeah. Well, like I said, it's...

27:25.640 --> 27:30.077
- If it's money you want, we can pay you.
- It's not money. It's...

27:30.280 --> 27:32.430
We?

27:32.640 --> 27:36.189
Yeah, there's someone else besides me.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.358
Please, don't say no.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.233
- No. What in the hell is wrong with you?
- It's one more person.

27:49.440 --> 27:53.035
It's Desmond Rhodes.
Besides, I heard he was going pro.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.631
He's not strong enough to be a four
and not quick enough to be a three.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.594
He's got no left hand
and his mid-range game needs work.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.677
I don't see it.

28:05.160 --> 28:09.631
Anna Ross, that's bad enough, but do
you know how high-profile Desmond is?

28:09.840 --> 28:13.719
He wants in. Anna says he needs it
and we can trust him.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.675
"Anna says he needs it."
What are we, a frickin' soup kitchen?

28:20.360 --> 28:25.992
Which brings me to point number two.
Last I heard we had no way of doing this.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.918
I been thinking about that.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.039
Hey. Was your father suspicious?

28:39.240 --> 28:42.596
No. To be suspicious,
he'd have to be interested.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.271
There are security codes, too.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.951
They gotta supply the building owner
with a copy in case of an emergency.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.391
- Yeah, I can get 'em.
- OK.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.756
- OK.
- I will see you Tuesday.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.797
OK. I'll see you Tuesday.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.192
- Francesca.
- Yeah?

29:04.400 --> 29:06.709
- That bad, huh?
- My father?

29:07.720 --> 29:12.271
No, whatever. "Poor little rich girl" thing
is a little played-out.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.677
It's like the oldest story
in the world, isn't it?

29:15.880 --> 29:18.235
Not if it's your story.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.960
- See you on Tuesday.
- I will see you Tuesday.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.037
Bye.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.313
And sometimes it's that easy.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.317
Shit happens. People join the cause.

29:46.440 --> 29:51.195
You're moving towards something
you didn't plan on approaching.

29:51.400 --> 29:57.270
Only by the time you're aware of it, the
plans of one become the plans of six.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.873
And the plans of six become one.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.151
Hey.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.237
We're eating.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.996
- Yeah.
- Bro, what's up?

30:16.880 --> 30:18.950
- Who is this?
- It's Roy.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.879
From the SAT thing.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.514
- How did you get this number?
- I'm the ghost.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.597
Give it to me.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.477
Who's calling, please?

30:35.240 --> 30:37.629
It's... Roy.

30:37.840 --> 30:43.073
Well, Roy, this is our dinner time. We
don't interrupt your dinner time, do we?

30:43.280 --> 30:46.078
Well, I don't have dinner time.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.909
Well, that's a shame. Do you have
some business with my son?

30:50.120 --> 30:54.272
Well, I am at this time

30:54.480 --> 31:00.669
assisting him
in his SAT exam preparations.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.189
And I was wondering

31:03.400 --> 31:09.111
if he could possibly
pick me up this evening,

31:09.320 --> 31:14.553
as I am currently without transportation.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.389
SAT? There's hope for you yet, Roy.

31:19.760 --> 31:23.833
- Why don't you give me that address?
- I appreciate that, ma'am.

31:24.040 --> 31:27.510
And may I say...

31:27.720 --> 31:31.349
...that you have an attractive voice.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.193
It's very pleasant.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.199
- Young-sounding.
- The address, please?

31:39.400 --> 31:43.871
4207 Triumph Street. With a T.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.719
Triumph. All right. He'll be there.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.956
Thank you, Roy.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.639
Oh, God.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.437
Be on time.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.436
Francesca, Tiffany.
Tiffany, my daughter Francesca.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.518
- Hi.
- Peace.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.277
Peace.

32:12.920 --> 32:17.152
No. P-l-E-C-E.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.639
She's just kidding.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.389
Dog. Cool.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.477
My socks.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.636
Sweet!

32:38.920 --> 32:41.115
What school gave you this?

32:42.800 --> 32:44.631
It's my uncle's ride, man.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.991
Well, what school gave it to your uncle?

32:48.200 --> 32:54.230
- Why you call yourself the ghost?
- At school I hear things and I see things.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.000
But nobody hears or sees me.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.953
- You think?
- I got your cell number, didn't I?

33:00.160 --> 33:02.230
So?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.991
You got mine?

33:07.960 --> 33:09.837
This fool is crazy.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.597
Don't touch my shit.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.518
- Eight o'clock.
- Your brother's not there?

33:21.720 --> 33:25.679
Don't worry. We got the place
to ourselves. He promised.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.117
Oh, shit.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.117
That's my brother.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.477
What's going on?

33:39.680 --> 33:41.671
Sorry, bro. Hope it comes out.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.589
- What's up?
- You said we could have the place.

33:45.800 --> 33:50.920
Was that supposed to be tonight?
'Cause tonight is wine-tasting Tuesday.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.035
What's up?

33:59.240 --> 34:03.028
- What's this?
- Wine-tasting Tuesday.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.276
Nice.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.995
Look, Larry. You promised.

34:09.800 --> 34:14.315
Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can do it next Tuesday.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.590
This is ETS.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.467
This is so cute, this whole thing.

34:24.280 --> 34:28.717
- I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.
- What the hell is she typing?

34:28.920 --> 34:31.672
- I'm just taking notes.
- This is ETS.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.869
- Who took that photo?
- Anna took it.

34:38.760 --> 34:41.911
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.

34:42.120 --> 34:47.353
You look comfortable in your Old Navy
cotton pullover. You gotta get this look.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.710
- Did I do something?
- You got a 4.0 GPA.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.592
Francesca, just stop it, all right?

34:53.800 --> 34:57.156
Do you know what the fatal flaw is
for most heists?

34:57.360 --> 35:02.275
It's trusting the team. So I'd like to know
why the valedictorian is here.

35:02.480 --> 35:06.553
- I'm not the valedictorian. I'm second.
- That explains everything.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.638
Everyone has their reasons.
We don't need to know.

35:09.840 --> 35:14.277
I think we do. In The Breakfast Club
they get stoned and make confessions.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.913
Sweet.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.556
Maybe we should all say
exactly why we're here.

35:19.760 --> 35:25.073
- Kyle said we wouldn't have to.
- Well, I think we do. I'll start.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.193
I'm here to make new friends.
And for the wine, of course.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.996
- How about you, superstar?
- I'm here 'cause the SAT is racist.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.431
- Well, that didn't take long, did it?
- You don't think so?

35:37.640 --> 35:41.679
Who created the test? Rich white guys.
Who scores the highest?

35:41.880 --> 35:46.635
Middle-class Asian girls who watch
less than an hour of TV a day.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.674
They can't drive, but they can
take the shit out of the SAT.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.791
Whatever. Why are you here?

35:53.000 --> 35:58.438
I'm not smart enough, as opposed
to this genius who's being screwed.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.756
It's unfair to certain groups.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.236
- Kiss-ass valedictorians.
- I'm not the valedictorian.

36:04.440 --> 36:08.149
- You're second.
- Enough!

36:08.360 --> 36:11.796
This is the floor plan
of the regional ETS office.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.279
This schedule tells us the specs of
security cameras here, here and here.

36:17.480 --> 36:22.713
- It's fruity and yet woody.
- Roy, pay attention. Please.

36:23.800 --> 36:29.113
Francesca has the codes to the locks
and we know where the answers are...

36:31.840 --> 36:34.308
- Yeah.
- This thing hemp?

36:34.520 --> 36:37.432
- This is never gonna work.
- It'll be OK.

36:37.640 --> 36:42.156
We're gonna be great. All-State's phone
is ringing off the hook and...

36:42.360 --> 36:45.272
Roy's trying to smoke Larry's comforter.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.199
Roy! I'm serious.
You're about outta here.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.871
Shit. It's shit.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.275
- You need some help with that?
- No.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.313
Not unless you can code Visual Basic.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.954
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.118
Some shit with the dynamic variables.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.758
- So are we gonna do this?
- We're gonna do this.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.997
- Turn your phone off.
- You got a problem with me?

37:18.200 --> 37:23.752
- No, with anybody who puts us at risk.
- Me? Fine. I don't need this shit.

37:23.960 --> 37:28.317
- Anna, are you down with this?
- Did you guys see Desmond on TV?

37:30.440 --> 37:32.635
Playing for St John's?

37:33.640 --> 37:35.995
He took 25 and 10 off North Carolina.

37:38.800 --> 37:44.511
Matty, you saw it, right? You were at
your apartment with Sandy in Maryland.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.875
I missed it. I had a date.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.231
But my room-mate at Brown
said it was great.

37:52.440 --> 37:57.195
It was. I saw the whole thing
from my Cornell dorm room.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.238
- Roy, you had money on it.
- I hope you covered the spread.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.989
We can do this. We can get
where each one of us wants to go.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.033
But we have got to trust each other.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.551
You talk a good game, but I think
your mom's gonna come in with snacks.

38:14.760 --> 38:19.754
This is serious.
Some of us have got a lot to lose.

38:19.960 --> 38:24.351
- I think that we all have a lot to lose.
- Fair enough. Hear me out.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.074
Anyone who doesn't
like the plan can walk.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.756
OK. Right.

38:40.520 --> 38:44.308
Friday afternoon
Francesca will enter through the lobby.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.999
The same as any other Friday.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.955
Then she'll make appointments
for me and Matty with her dad's firm.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.235
What if he recognises you?

38:56.440 --> 38:58.874
- He won't recognise me.
- He might.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.195
Down! Freeze!

39:06.280 --> 39:07.554
Hands up!

39:08.960 --> 39:10.871
He won't recognise me.

39:11.080 --> 39:16.791
Once I'm in, Matty's gonna sign in
and join us in Francesca's father's office.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.712
- Where am I gonna be?
- You're waiting in the woods nearby.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.275
With that big-ass crow?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.678
Alone?

39:32.880 --> 39:35.189
No, with Desmond and Anna.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.474
- Roy.
- Yeah, baby. You feel that?

39:48.240 --> 39:50.629
- Give it to me.
- Who's your daddy now?

39:52.600 --> 39:54.556
Maybe we should all go together.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.435
We need you outside for when
the night guard makes his rounds.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.474
Their rotation isn't precise
and we're using flashlights.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.150
We watch out for the guards
to make sure you cut 'em off.

40:06.360 --> 40:10.751
Francesca's gonna ask the guard
to disconnect the alarm on the rear door,

40:10.960 --> 40:15.715
saying she has boxes to unload,
something she's done in the past.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.077
Hold it right there.

40:49.160 --> 40:55.429
Matty and I have 20 seconds to get
to the stairwell before the guard returns.

40:56.920 --> 41:01.357
We'll take the stairs to the roof
and wait for Francesca's key card.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.790
From here we're almost home.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.675
We get in, we get the answers
and we get out.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.917
Shortly after midnight, this is me.

41:14.280 --> 41:19.513
25 minutes into Saturday morning and
a whole lot closer to the rest of my life.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.915
Who's gonna join me?

41:27.280 --> 41:29.111
All right.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.077
You smoke?

41:59.320 --> 42:01.550
Makes kissing kinda nasty.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.637
We won't be kissing, huh?

42:05.600 --> 42:08.319
No, I was just...

42:09.040 --> 42:10.917
Why are you here?

42:11.880 --> 42:15.668
- I need the answers.
- To join Sandy at Maryland.

42:18.040 --> 42:22.113
What's so great about her?
Aside from being smoke-free.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.915
You wouldn't get it.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.315
- Try me.
- All right.

42:29.560 --> 42:34.634
It's, like, I don't get the best grades.
I'm not really great at anything.

42:34.840 --> 42:38.389
But here was something
that I was finally great at.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.830
I was great at being with Sandy.

42:42.280 --> 42:47.593
I could make her laugh.
I could guess what she was thinking.

42:48.520 --> 42:52.798
And it was just... great.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.116
It was great.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.557
And?

43:00.640 --> 43:04.553
And I just can't wait to be great again.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.158
We're here for the bank's money,
not your money.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.989
Think of your families.
Don't risk your life.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.112
Sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.191
And so the day arrived.

43:39.400 --> 43:43.109
We had packed it, rolled it, smoked it.

43:43.320 --> 43:46.551
Now it was time to ride the buzz.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.239
- Yeah.
- It's me.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.715
Set your phone to vibrate. Call me back.

44:18.760 --> 44:22.548
From here on we're gonna use redial.
Tell Roy the same thing.

44:24.880 --> 44:26.757
Thank you.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.638
Shit. I forgot the bolt-cutters.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.876
- What?
- Just kidding.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.593
That's funny.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.678
Here we go. Masks.

45:11.920 --> 45:15.708
- Did you bring your floaties?
- It's all I could find.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.357
All right. We're here.
The answers are here.

45:51.560 --> 45:55.792
Keep your masks on till we get past
the security cameras. Just in case.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.511
- You walk much?
- My mask is fogged.

46:06.320 --> 46:10.393
There's a camera around the corner.
Stay low and tight to the wall.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.795
What do we do if it sees us?

46:13.000 --> 46:16.834
About three to six months
and a lot of community service.

46:22.760 --> 46:25.115
I'm not gonna look at your underwear.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.675
Who says I'm wearing any?

46:41.480 --> 46:43.357
Matty, are you OK?

46:43.560 --> 46:46.711
I can't see...! I can't see
through this stupid mask.

46:46.920 --> 46:49.150
Just come forward.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.236
Two o'clock.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.633
- This way.
- Where am I going?

46:56.840 --> 46:59.035
Grab my hand.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.917
- Thanks.
- This way.

47:12.560 --> 47:16.348
- Nature calls.
- Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

47:16.560 --> 47:19.438
No. Nature calls.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.639
Can I ask you a question?

47:38.240 --> 47:40.629
Why do you smoke pot?

47:44.680 --> 47:46.557
Something to do.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.434
Why do you bite your fingernails?

48:11.360 --> 48:13.920
This is it. Francesca.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.752
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present you with...

48:23.400 --> 48:25.550
...a serious waste of time.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.718
Why would you lock the door to this?

48:28.920 --> 48:30.797
This was it.

48:31.280 --> 48:35.114
Matty, I swear, this was it.
The answers went to 510 for filing.

48:35.320 --> 48:38.153
"Went to" doesn't help us now, does it?

48:39.760 --> 48:43.196
I had the answers in my hands...

48:49.080 --> 48:51.036
"One comes back to me."

48:51.240 --> 48:53.117
Kyle... What?

48:54.040 --> 48:55.712
Shit!

48:56.920 --> 48:58.717
What are you doing?

49:10.680 --> 49:12.591
- You...
- Who the hell was that?

49:12.800 --> 49:15.633
Bernie, the night guard
who hits on everybody.

49:15.840 --> 49:18.400
- He's early.
- Where were you going?

49:18.600 --> 49:20.318
"One comes back to me."

49:20.520 --> 49:25.116
The guy who sent me to copy the
answers said, "One comes back to me."

49:25.320 --> 49:30.235
- So you wanna call him at home?
- I wanna find his office. 545.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.749
Roy, what time do you have?

49:37.960 --> 49:40.554
About that time.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.957
Can you see the far side
of the building from here?

49:46.400 --> 49:49.233
I'm gonna go see
if I can get a better view.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.717
Shit.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.113
My phone. My phone.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.194
Shit.

50:52.360 --> 50:54.749
Roy. Roy, the guard.

50:56.440 --> 50:59.512
- There's a problem with my phone.
- What problem?

51:02.440 --> 51:04.192
Phone.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.435
- Yeah.
- Shut off the lights.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.240
- Yes?
- Sorry.

51:24.440 --> 51:27.989
- All clear.
- Tell Roy I'm kicking his ass.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.831
Hey, I got it. It's office 545.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.480
Hey. Maybe it's in here.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.199
You know what this means.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.197
Hello?

52:07.040 --> 52:09.474
It's for you.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.398
Is it a chick?

52:15.240 --> 52:17.470
- Hello.
- Roy, we need your help.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.316
Who is this?

52:22.520 --> 52:24.795
It's Kyle, Roy.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.398
- Clyde's.
- Dave, it's Matty.

52:30.600 --> 52:33.910
- What's up, man?
- I need some flowers delivered.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.270
- Tell him roses.
- Make it roses.

52:36.480 --> 52:40.598
And you think you could hook me up
with a bottle of champagne?

52:43.400 --> 52:50.397
- Yeah, man, I think I could do that.
- Nice. And I need a card signed.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.318
From your secret admirer.

52:52.520 --> 52:55.751
From your secret admirer.
Here's the name and address.

52:58.520 --> 53:02.399
If you could do anything with your life
and money was no object,

53:02.600 --> 53:04.477
what would you do?

53:04.680 --> 53:07.194
Anything at all?

53:10.880 --> 53:15.715
When I was a kid,
I used to play this video game for hours.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.718
Street Fighter II.

53:18.920 --> 53:23.835
And I remember thinking,
"People get paid to do this,

53:24.040 --> 53:27.476
"to think up the game
and to create the characters."

53:27.680 --> 53:31.195
Like there's this one character, Blanka.

53:31.400 --> 53:36.190
He's half-human and half-lizard,
eats his opponents.

53:38.800 --> 53:45.194
Well, he either zaps them with lightning
or he bites their faces off.

53:46.160 --> 53:51.188
- It's pretty cool.
- So you'd design video games.

53:54.400 --> 53:57.949
No. I'd kinda like to be Blanka.

54:03.880 --> 54:07.839
I was thinking
someday I might wanna be an actor.

54:08.040 --> 54:14.070
As opposed to solving world hunger
or curing a terminal disease?

54:14.280 --> 54:18.671
- See what I mean?
- I would run a no-kill animal shelter.

54:18.880 --> 54:22.873
Or... l'd just be a mom.

54:24.960 --> 54:29.317
Not just a mother.
I would be a real mom.

54:30.760 --> 54:35.993
Who cared more about the title of parent
than the one on her business card.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.795
Or porn.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.396
Hey, guys. Dave's here.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.192
- When she opens the door, haul ass.
- What do I do?

54:56.400 --> 54:59.710
You wait here with me.
They only need Roy.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.677
Flash, you ready?

55:09.720 --> 55:11.551
You need to get off that bong.

55:17.320 --> 55:20.630
- I'm here.
- Wait. Not yet. Wait for me.

55:25.520 --> 55:28.239
- Are you sure they just need Roy?
- Just Roy.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.395
Roy, get ready.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.117
- You Bernie?
- Yeah.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.673
Delivery.

55:51.720 --> 55:53.597
- Go.
- Go.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.718
Go.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.759
Hell, no.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.634
Shit.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.315
- Is he in?
- What the hell was that?

56:32.520 --> 56:34.158
Francesca, is he in?

56:34.360 --> 56:36.874
- He's in. Plus two.
- What?

56:39.880 --> 56:42.553
Oh, man. Not steps.

56:47.720 --> 56:51.156
We think the answers are in here,
but there's a password.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.158
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.355
You're a filthy man, Arnie.

57:25.720 --> 57:28.951
- What do they call this thing?
- Verification master.

57:38.160 --> 57:42.870
"Mercer County SAT exam to be
administered Fall 2004." Print one.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.275
Print one. Let's get outta here.

57:48.800 --> 57:52.713
You need three other passwords
and three other people to print.

57:52.920 --> 57:54.433
Can't you figure it out?

57:54.640 --> 57:57.677
Give me six months
and the CIA mainframe.

57:57.880 --> 58:00.519
- That was fun.
- The exam's right here.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.632
You just need the answers.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.671
Exactly.

58:08.440 --> 58:11.318
I get it. Come on, team.
Makes perfect sense.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.876
We'll take the test now
so we can steal our own answers.

58:15.080 --> 58:19.870
Then we'll take the real test with the
answers we were afraid would be wrong.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.640
It's nice. It's really nice.

58:22.840 --> 58:26.150
- So who wants pancakes?
- Guys, the exam's right here.

58:26.360 --> 58:30.751
It's bigger than us one on one,
but there's no way it'll beat six of us.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.679
- Come on.
- Just try this.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.077
"If it takes 15 people
8 hours to make 100 items,

58:37.280 --> 58:41.114
"how many hours will it take 6 people,
working at the same rate,

58:41.320 --> 58:43.276
"to make half as many items?"

58:43.480 --> 58:44.754
10?

58:46.200 --> 58:48.998
- 10 hours?
- D. 10.

58:51.120 --> 58:54.317
She's second in the class.

58:54.520 --> 59:00.311
"A 10-quart mixture consists by volume
of 1 part juice to 9 parts water."

59:00.520 --> 59:03.353
What lightweight's making this drink?

59:06.880 --> 59:11.271
"If x quarts of juice and y quarts of water
are added to make 27 quarts

59:11.480 --> 59:16.793
"that consists by volume of 1 part juice
to 2 parts water, what is the value of x?"

59:17.600 --> 59:18.874
9.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.033
- C is 9.
- No.

59:23.240 --> 59:27.677
It says, "If x quarts of juice are added,
what is the value of x?"

59:27.880 --> 59:32.749
We already have one part juice,
so 9 minus 1 equals x.

59:32.960 --> 59:34.996
- 8.
- Yeah.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.919
- D is 8.
- He's right. Sorry.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.953
No, guys, don't be sorry.
That's two down.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.913
We could walk away,
but what are we walking to?

59:44.120 --> 59:46.793
I say we take a shot as a group.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.753
- We can do this.
- Unless we run out of time.

59:49.960 --> 59:52.633
Can you access this
from another computer?

59:52.840 --> 59:55.354
- So long as it's in this office.
- Done.

59:55.560 --> 59:58.552
Someone's gotta take a crack
at verbal. Francesca?

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.354
No. Me and words are not so goodly.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.599
OK. Anna, you and I'll do verbal.
Someone's gotta do math.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.677
I'll do it.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.388
- Are you sure? It could be...
- Ever heard the term "Kiss my ass"?

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.832
Math doesn't scare me.
You just take care of the verbal.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.237
- Who's helping Des?
- Well, I guess I can.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.908
But only with quadratic equations,

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.556
coordinate geometry
and algebraic visualisations.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.075
- If you want.
- Yeah.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.669
Hasselhoff, it looks like you and me.
We'll watch the lobby.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.272
You don't have to wait there. The guard's
not due for a couple of hours.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.960
Sandy liked this blue colour.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.109
True Berry Blue.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.675
Not any more.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.633
You said, "Liked."
You said, "Sandy liked."

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.356
Likes. Whatever.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.914
What's wrong?
She doesn't call any more?

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.156
She calls.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.669
Yeah, but not like before.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.837
She's busy.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.677
Matty, it's over.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.993
It's never gonna be like the way it was.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.912
Don't...

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.795
- You don't know anything about it.
- I know it's not healthy.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.599
And folding yourself up into a web page
'cause Daddy doesn't love you is?

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.635
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.996
Then why'd you say it?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.873
Because she doesn't call any more.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.199
Remember when you said you were
great at being Sandy's boyfriend?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.277
Well, you weren't.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.993
That's nice. Why don't you rub it in...

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.829
You weren't great at being
some girl's boyfriend, Matty.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.350
You just found someone
who let you be OK with yourself.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.198
- x is to y...
...as this shit is to boring.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.869
What score do you need on the test?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.038
- A 900.
- And you're taking the math for us?

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.631
I was afraid of the verbal.
I can ace the math and still not get 900.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.833
- So why don't you go pro?
- You don't know my mom, man.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.316
She's all about college degrees.
She works three jobs.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.035
If I blow my knee out in college,
all I got is credits.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.314
If I blow my knee out in the NBA, I got
a four-year guaranteed contract. Millions.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.954
What does she say
when you tell her that?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.518
I can't.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.716
- You just don't know my mom, man.
- All 'cause you can't talk to your mom?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.434
- Can you talk to yours?
- My mom's dead.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.677
But if she wasn't...

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.313
Yeah, I think I could talk to her.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.109
Let me get in there. Here we go.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.508
You know, a lot of people
think these questions are difficult.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.237
- Not me.
- No?

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.552
No. These questions all have answers.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.270
- We good?
- Yeah.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.357
Let's get outta here.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.000
- Roy, what's in your bag?
- Nothing.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.555
I needed some school supplies.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.672
- Roy, you can't take this stuff.
- Why not?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.156
If anything's missing,
Francesca's gonna get busted.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.035
- Why did you take the guy's photo?
- The wife is hot. Look.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.232
- I'll help him take it back.
- We'll wait here.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.795
Anna and I'll be on the roof.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.158
I can't believe it. This is so awesome!

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.590
You got your answers.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.749
Yeah, that too, but it's all of it.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.837
We did it.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.156
We haven't done anything yet.
What's going on with you?

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.920
I don't know. I'm having fun, I guess.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.510
I know how people see me.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.953
Like one of those perfect girls
that everything always works out for.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.119
I just always wanted
to punch one of them in the face.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.149
I'm not a robot.
I just haven't done very much... yet.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.954
There's a lot of stuff I haven't done, too.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.357
Yeah, but I've never really done anything.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.839
I mean, I've never broken curfew
and I've never cut class

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.114
and I've never... made out on a rooftop.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.034
Shit!

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.390
- What happened?
- Someone's here.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.517
- Shit.
- Grab my hand. I'll pull you up.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.597
Francesca first. Hold on.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.116
- What's wrong?
- Francesca's not gonna make it.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.876
- We gotta go.
- We're not gonna leave her like this.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.150
- We don't have a choice.
- No.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.069
- I'll go.
- Rhodes, you're gonna get screwed.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.989
- Francesca knew the risk. So did you.
- He's right. Come on.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.033
- Come on.
- This shit is messed up.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.276
Come on.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.636
Come on, Roy.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.194
Matty.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.634
Matty, come on.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.319
I'm good.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.953
What? Matty, come on.
Give me your hand.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.118
- I'm good, Kyle.
- Matt. What about Sandy?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.956
What about her?

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.595
This one's on me.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:47.671
Hold it right there. Get your hands up.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.394
Kyle, we gotta go.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:18.877
- I can't do this. Guys, I can't do this.
- Kyle. It's done.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:29.711
We use the key card to get out.
Desmond and Roy go right. We go left.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.832
Meet at the car.
I'll bring copies of this in the morning.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.430
So how did it go?

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.995
- Don't you sleep?
- Not tonight.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.430
What happened to you, kid?

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.598
What happened to me?
What happened to you, Larry?

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.075
You were supposed to be
my big brother.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.353
- What am I now, the walking dead?
- Pretty much. I mean...

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.553
- How do you think Mom and Dad feel?
- How do you think they feel?

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.673
- I don't know. Not good, probably.
- Let me ask you a question.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.156
Which do you prefer:
the son who lives above the garage

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.477
or the son who cheats
his way into college?

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.435
Next time you pull off a heist,
don't leave your plans in my bed, idiot!

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.397
Matty got arrested.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.113
So what do you think, fair trade?

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.153
I think that's a shitty thing to ask.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.990
At least you're starting
to sound like my little brother.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.395
Maybe it's in there somewhere.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.836
Is there anything you don't know?

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.075
There's plenty I don't know.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.471
But I will tell you something
that you don't know.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.435
Did you know that every Christmas
after you go to bed,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.395
Dad, Mom and I sit up and we talk about
how proud we are of you?

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.998
How great it is to see this kid,
this whole future in front of him,

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.998
and how he deserves that,

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.397
'cause he's a good guy
and he does the right thing.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.232
Every Christmas for how long?

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.273
I don't know. Ten years or somethin'.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.196
You don't think I would have liked
to sit up with you?

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.233
Yeah, but you'd just stress us out.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.077
Night, little brother.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.239
- Word of advice.
- Why not?

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.876
Never take advice from anyone
who lives above a garage.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.316
How long since
your mother passed, baby?

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.310
Nine years ago. I was eight.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.994
That's a shame.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.591
My son tells me
you encouraged him to talk to me.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.112
You're a smart boy, Roy. So why are you
doing a stupid thing like drugs?

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.196
Something to do.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.190
"Something to do."

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.598
You know how they say, "Thank the Lord
my mother's not alive to see this"?

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.074
No.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.875
Somebody's mother is,
and I am not happy with this.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.991
I'm... sorry.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.273
You get yourself a shower
and some clean clothes. We'll wait.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.995
Fix you some breakfast
before the exam. OK?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:32.311
I've been thinking about that, Mrs...
Desmond's mom.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.628
I'm not taking that exam.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.595
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not going to college.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.558
See, and even if I did,

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.558
I'd just be taking the place of someone

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.799
that really wanted to be there
more than me.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.396
You're a smart boy, Roy.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.230
But, baby, there's a whole lot of dumb
dribbling out of your mouth right now.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.592
Now, did you hear what I said
about a shower and clean clothes?

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.597
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.153
You'll find I don't like to repeat myself.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.237
- Get your ass up!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.954
Not everybody can pull it off, but the
dashing criminal thing looks good on you.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.197
Wait till you smell it.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.917
You know what I was thinking in there?
I need to work on being alone.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.996
Or not.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.872
Anyone ever tell you
you're a hell of a kisser?

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.631
Not as good as my cellmate Ramón,
but it's not bad.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.515
- What about the exam?
- Here's the thing.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.589
Once you've spent the night in jail with
the worst version of who you could be,

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.677
the SAT ain't nothing.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.233
How about you? You gonna be all right?

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.519
Yeah. I think it's gonna be a nice day.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.637
Sick And Twisted. SAT.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.718
Secretly A Tease.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.276
I completely have lost touch
with who you are.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.429
Unacceptable. You're out all night doing
God knows what with God knows whom.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.714
Jeopardising everything we've worked for
on the eve of the biggest day of your life.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.195
This is the real world. Remember that.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.315
You feel pressured, you deal with it.
You do not stay out all night.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.035
Do you hear me? This is
your last chance to get into Brown.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.869
You know what? That reminds me.
I'm not going to Brown.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.637
Now you deal with it.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.917
Check you out.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.753
I just told my mom
I'm not going to Brown.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.989
- The guys at Brown'll be disappointed.
- The girls at Brown'll be disappointed.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.638
- So where are you gonna go?
- I don't know.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.559
Europe, maybe. Then college.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.117
What's up?

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.518
- Nah.
- Really?

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.395
I already nailed the math
and, plus, you don't know my mom.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:35.559
- Roy?
- Shit, man. You don't know D's mom.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.516
I wanted to go back and get you,
but Kyle said screw you.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.919
You look like a slut.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.998
- I like it.
- Thank you.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.998
- I'm sorry, man.
- Shut up. Don't be.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.670
Besides, it's not that bad.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.269
- No, I don't need 'em.
- Come on, man. Take them.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.756
I'm serious. I took the test.
I'm not taking it again.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.791
- You got arrested.
- Hey.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.953
- Unbelievable. Francesca?
- No.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.789
- Guys, what is this?
- I wasn't in it for the answers.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.959
- Besides, I got a 1460 last semester.
- You didn't tell us that.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.515
You didn't ask.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.474
- Wait. Are you out, too?
- Do I look like I need the answers?

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.796
You look like you need a pimp.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.676
After all of this, nobody's gonna
even use these answers?

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.110
You are, aren't you?

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.998
- No.
- Kyle, this is your dream, man.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.797
Yeah, it is, but if they wanna put
a number on that, then to hell with them.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.355
I know who I am.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.792
When did you have
this little moment of clarity?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.117
The same time
my jackass best friend got arrested.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.436
So all this was for nothing?

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.359
I wouldn't call this nothing.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.794
Man, screw this!

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.637
You have 30 minutes.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.680
OK, so I didn't cheat on the test,

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.031
but no way was I gonna let
those answers go to waste.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:58.395
Next year at Harvard,
SAT stands for Stoned And Toasted.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.189
Speaking of college,
Desmond kicked ass on the re-test

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.949
and decided to play ball
at St John's University.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:14.314
His mom was happy and, trust me,
you want D's mom happy.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.917
Matty survived probation
and some serious community service.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.271
He once told me
that he might like to be an actor.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.914
If not, then just happy.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.680
He's working on both.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.474
Francesca sold her first novel.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:37.231
It's about six kids who conspire
to steal the SAT answers.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.638
If they make a movie out of it,
I wonder who'll play me?

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.070
He'd better be hung like a horse.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.389
Kyle did fine on his exam.
Anna crushed him.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.355
He's at Syracuse now, where his dream
of becoming an architect is still alive.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.437
Anna went off to Europe

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.076
and eventually found her way
to college on her own terms.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.671
Every other weekend in New York when
a woman boards a train at midnight

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.394
and a man boards that same train,

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.795
now we know what happens.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.790
Life happens, romance, adventure.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.833
The stuff you won't find on a test.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.829
I had the highest score in the county,

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.079
but that didn't exactly offset
my 0.0 GPA.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:29.479
Eventually, I was forced, I mean
encouraged, to get my GED.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.353
I still spend most of my time
on video games.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:38.475
In fact, the number one selling game
last year was created by me.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.997
That's right, baby. Standardise this!
