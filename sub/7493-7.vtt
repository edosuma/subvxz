WEBVTT

00:10.709 --> 00:14.041
How cool is it that they found the
remains of the feared pirate Longshanks

00:14.125 --> 00:15.625
when they added that new parking lot?

00:15.709 --> 00:17.250
Hey, why'd they call him Longshanks?

00:17.291 --> 00:18.959
Well, have you seen the man's shanks?

00:19.917 --> 00:21.500
Uh, I'm sure they're not that...

00:22.667 --> 00:23.667
Whoa.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.250
Bro, those are some pretty long shanks.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.959
I love Pirate Fest.

00:28.083 --> 00:31.125
A whole week of pirate fun,
and it drums up business for the wharf.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.250
Hey, uh,

00:33.333 --> 00:34.917
don't you think the people
that get so into it

00:35.000 --> 00:36.500
that they dress up are a little weird?

00:36.583 --> 00:38.166
No, I don't, Jack.
I think they're exactly--

00:38.250 --> 00:39.959
There be me scurvy dogs!

00:40.083 --> 00:41.583
Arr!

00:43.208 --> 00:44.291
Yep, little weird.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.417
Yeah, Rudy, I see you're really into
Pirate Fest, huh?

00:47.792 --> 00:49.250
You got the boots, the pantaloons--

00:49.291 --> 00:52.917
Oh yeah, I even had Fred the barber
duct tape a couple of hooks to my hands.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.875
What happens when you have to go
to the bathroom?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.291
I did not think this through.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.000
I'm back, and I got 'em.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.959
Milton, you muzzle Jerry,
I'll get the flea shampoo.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.208
What?

01:05.291 --> 01:07.375
No, I don't have fleas again, guys.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.333
No, I got Mama G's tamales.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.291
I went all the way to Arizona to
get 'em, and it was so worth it.

01:13.375 --> 01:16.625
Why would you go all the way to Arizona
for some ground beef and soggy corn--

01:21.000 --> 01:22.083
Milton, where are you going?

01:22.166 --> 01:23.333
Arizona!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.375
Milton, relax.
You're not going to Arizona.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.542
Ow!

01:26.959 --> 01:29.291
If I have to,
I will take your arm with me.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.417
Okay, okay.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.917
Never, ever...

01:33.000 --> 01:34.792
come between a man and his tamales.

01:36.875 --> 01:38.375
Be warned!

01:38.834 --> 01:40.291
This wharf is cursed!

01:40.917 --> 01:42.917
I hear that, you can't get a date either?

01:43.667 --> 01:47.417
Three hundred years ago,
a lunar eclipse caused Longshanks

01:47.750 --> 01:49.834
to crash into these very shores.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.291
Beware the eclipse.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.166
It returns tonight

01:55.250 --> 01:57.041
and so will Longshanks...

01:57.959 --> 02:00.333
to take revenge on anyone found

02:00.583 --> 02:02.917
on this cursed wharf!

02:03.917 --> 02:05.875
Beware!

02:07.291 --> 02:08.250
Well, that was weird.

02:12.041 --> 02:12.959
Uh-oh.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.542
Hey, Jack, we've been friends
for a long time, haven't we?

02:17.291 --> 02:18.166
Yeah.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.750
- And you know I'd do anything for you--
- Not gonna help you pee, Rudy.

Hey, Rudy,

03:03.625 --> 03:05.917
that old fisherman yapping about
the pirate curse spook you at all?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.208
Please.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.333
I am a grown man. I don't get scared.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.500
Ty, what are you doing here?

03:13.875 --> 03:15.291
I had to take a second job.

03:15.750 --> 03:17.417
Oh, so the rumors are true.

03:17.709 --> 03:20.917
That's right, I had hair removed from
some places and added to others.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.458
Were your eyebrows,
at one time, your pit hair?

03:25.125 --> 03:26.500
No, they were not.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.583
What kind of a freak do you think I am?

03:32.458 --> 03:35.291
I was talking about the rumors
that the Black Dragon Dojo might close.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.750
It's no secret a lot of your students
are now my students.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.291
That's right.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.291
Old Ty has fallen on some hard times.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.667
And if you want to kick me while I'm down
and it makes you feel like bigger men,

03:45.750 --> 03:46.959
then you go right ahead.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.750
Uh, look, Ty, we're not
those types of guys--

03:49.834 --> 03:51.041
Hey, everybody, look at Ty!

03:51.125 --> 03:52.458
He's a pit-browed burger jockey.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.417
Rudy?

03:55.500 --> 03:56.542
He said I could.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.500
Rudy, look.

03:58.583 --> 03:59.959
It's that creepy, old fisherman.

04:00.959 --> 04:03.917
You guys aren't buying into that
dumb ghost story, are you?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.166
- No.
- Little bit.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.625
I mean, no.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.208
I warned you.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.583
Dude, I don't know what's scarier.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.375
Your high-speed vampire travel,
or the booger in your nose.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.458
You got a serious bat in the cave, bro.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.583
Told you to leave before it was too late.

04:25.709 --> 04:27.375
Well, it's too late.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.500
Look, guys. Longshanks, he's gone.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.750
What?

04:35.458 --> 04:36.625
Oh, no, no.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.875
The fisherman said that
Longshanks would return

04:38.959 --> 04:41.959
with the lunar eclipse and take
revenge on anyone on the wharf.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.083
Look, it's happening.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.375
Oh, no.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.667
Rudy, calm down.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.583
There has to be a logical
explanation for this.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.000
No need to freak out.

04:59.542 --> 05:02.917
The spirit locked the door. We can't
get in. We're doomed, we're doomed!

05:04.500 --> 05:05.417
Pull.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.000
We're doomed!

05:15.208 --> 05:17.166
<i>♪ Hey, come on ♪</i>

05:18.250 --> 05:19.792
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

05:20.208 --> 05:23.041
It sure was nice of your cousin to let us
borrow his motor home to get here.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.250
We made great time.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.583
Oh, yeah, it helped not
having to make bathroom stops.

05:26.667 --> 05:27.542
Yeah.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.000
Wait, there's no bathroom in there.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.250
There is now.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.834
Hey, yo, where'd the moon go?

05:36.917 --> 05:38.500
Oh, tonight's the lunar eclipse.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.000
Strange events that you can't
explain are known to happen.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.583
Yeah, sure they are.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, they gave me their phone numbers.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.250
Okay, I can't explain that.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.500
Okay, we're next.

05:56.583 --> 05:59.417
Remember, Mama G is very strict
about how you order,

05:59.583 --> 06:01.917
so watch and do it just the way I do,

06:02.458 --> 06:03.291
okay?

06:07.542 --> 06:08.667
Hello, Mama G.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.208
You're looking lovely today.

06:11.917 --> 06:12.792
Uh...

06:12.875 --> 06:14.917
Can I please have one
of your world-famous tamales?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.417
Hello, Mama G.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.917
May I please have one of
your world-famous tamales?

06:43.083 --> 06:45.458
Oh, thank you. Looks delish.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.166
You know what this could use?
Just a smidge of hot sauce.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.291
No tamales for you!

06:59.792 --> 07:01.542
But it was just a smidge, just a smidge.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.291
Uh, no, no, Mama G, Mama G,
forgive him. He's a friend of mine.

07:04.834 --> 07:08.041
Oh, I'm sorry. I did not know that.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.291
In that case...

07:09.458 --> 07:11.625
- No more tamales for you, either!
- What?

07:12.166 --> 07:13.500
You are both banned.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.291
Who gets banned for a smidge?
It was just a smidge.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
Thanks a lot, Milton.

07:20.375 --> 07:23.041
You realize this is the last
tamale I'll ever get from Mama G?

07:23.125 --> 07:24.458
You can't get this anywhere, man.

07:24.542 --> 07:25.667
It's a secret recipe.

07:27.041 --> 07:27.959
Wait a minute.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.000
No secret is safe from science.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.583
I can deconstruct that tamale
and know everything that's in it.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.000
And then we can make
as many tamales as we want.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.208
Mmm.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.667
That's a great idea.
There's just one problem.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.375
I can't stop eating this thing!

07:41.458 --> 07:43.291
Stop it, just put it...
Get it out of your mouth.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.542
- Will you... Milton!
- No!

07:49.291 --> 07:50.500
They're ready!

08:01.500 --> 08:02.667
Whoo!

08:04.375 --> 08:06.208
Dude, these are even better than Mama G's.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.375
I bet if we sold these, we could
drive Mama G's out of business.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.875
Oh, let's do it.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.250
Bro, what is your secret recipe?

08:13.709 --> 08:17.959
I use the rarest, hottest,
and tastiest chili in the world.

08:18.041 --> 08:19.291
The red dragon.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.792
It only grows on the night
of the lunar eclipse.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.041
Yeah, one holiday my Nana ate
a red dragon chili,

08:25.458 --> 08:28.083
when she bent over to pick up her gifts
she set the Christmas tree on fire.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.709
- Mmm.
- Let's cook.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.417
Man, this whole haunting of the wharf
thing is my fault.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.000
I'm what the paranormal experts
call "ghost candy."

08:44.917 --> 08:46.166
Okay, look Rudy, I'll admit it.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.000
There are some weird things
going on around here,

08:48.083 --> 08:50.333
but I'm sure you're the only one
that's overreacting this way.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.500
The wharf is haunted!

08:53.583 --> 08:55.291
It's all real, and it's all my fault.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.083
I'm what paranormal
experts call "ghost bait."

08:59.041 --> 09:00.000
You?

09:00.083 --> 09:01.709
Please, they're not here for you.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.875
They're here for me.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.917
You mean to tell me, if you were
a tormented spirit from beyond,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.542
you wouldn't be all over...

09:09.291 --> 09:10.250
this?

09:11.709 --> 09:13.542
Not if I had the option of...

09:14.250 --> 09:15.291
this.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.875
Oh, really? Well what about this?

09:18.667 --> 09:21.083
Uh, that's nothing. Have you seen this?

09:21.166 --> 09:23.208
-
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.333
What you two are doing is so much
scarier than any ghost.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.625
You guys are getting crazy
over some stolen bones.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.917
They weren't stolen. Check this out.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.041
I went to tell security
about the missing bones

09:34.125 --> 09:36.083
and they showed me this footage

09:36.166 --> 09:38.125
from the surveillance
camera in the courtyard.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.333
Oh, did you...

09:47.375 --> 09:48.500
Did you see that?

09:48.583 --> 09:50.375
Longshanks turned his
head right at the camera.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.166
Where'd he go?

09:58.166 --> 10:00.250
I've watched that 18
times and it still gets me.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.917
All right, I can't explain that video.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.917
But the one thing that I do
know is that ghosts are not real.

10:14.291 --> 10:17.250
You should start
believing in ghosts, Jack.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.667
Because you're looking at one.

10:23.417 --> 10:24.291
Take the boy!

10:37.625 --> 10:38.500
Okay.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.208
Guys, we have got to get out of here.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.250
I've got a plan.
We'll sneak out the window,

10:42.291 --> 10:45.250
cut through the bowling alley, and go out
the back doors to the parking lot.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.417
Yeah, that's great.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.500
My car is parked out front in a sweet spot
reserved for pregnant women.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.625
Wait a second, didn't I help you
with your groceries this morning?

11:02.291 --> 11:04.250
Yep, you did. And I meant to thank you.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.041
Not one of my eggs was broken.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.041
That's because I did some rearranging.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.667
I made a little nest with the
bread, muffins, and tube socks.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.417
Guys, guys, listen.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.375
I don't hear anything.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.709
I think Longshanks is gone.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.667
He is so not gone.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.291
To the bowling alley.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.792
I can't believe you stole
my night-vision goggles.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.166
What, you think they're gonna help you
see the ghost or something?

11:31.250 --> 11:32.709
No, it's so they don't poke my eyeballs.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.166
That's how they get you.

11:35.709 --> 11:36.625
Give 'em back.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.583
- Absolutely... No, no!
- Give 'em back.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.458
Hey Rudy, there's a strange
mist coming from behind you.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.792
Sorry, ghosts make me nervous.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.917
Uh, no, it's a fog, and seems
to be getting thicker.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.500
Ty!

11:53.709 --> 11:54.834
Oh, no.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.291
Wait, he's gone.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.458
No!

11:57.750 --> 11:58.959
They took Ty.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.375
Ugh!

12:01.458 --> 12:03.291
That means he really is ghost bait.

12:04.041 --> 12:04.959
Rudy, let's go.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.500
This is the last batch today, people.

12:11.583 --> 12:14.500
So, if you'll please form an orderly line,
we can get through all---

12:17.583 --> 12:18.500
Ow!

12:26.750 --> 12:30.750
Oh, I'd love to see the look on Mama G's
face when she realizes how much business

12:30.875 --> 12:32.000
we're taking from her.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.709
Yeah, that's pretty much
how I imagined it.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.083
Word on the street is your
tamales are better than mine.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.291
They are.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.542
If you're not seeing it,

12:43.875 --> 12:46.166
I'm fanning myself with a bunch of money.

12:50.959 --> 12:51.875
Whoo!

12:53.458 --> 12:54.750
You cook for us now.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.208
- I don't think so.
-

12:59.333 --> 13:02.875
Oh, are your big, powerful daughters
supposed to intimidate us?

13:04.041 --> 13:06.291
Well, we will not be intimidated!

13:08.583 --> 13:11.333
All right, sister. We can
do this the easy way...

13:12.625 --> 13:13.875
Or the hard way.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.333
The easy way it is.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.750
All right, all we have to do
is sneak through the bowling alley

13:26.834 --> 13:28.583
and go out the back door
to the parking lot.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.583
Rudy, it's another ghost. This is bad.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.583
I know, if he picks up this
spare he's gonna beat my record.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.583
Hey, no, no, no. That doesn't count.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.083
You stepped over the line.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.041
Oh, and you're dead.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.458
<i>Get off me wharf.</i>

13:55.542 --> 13:57.750
Rudy, it's Longshanks. Dude,
we gotta get out of here.

13:57.834 --> 13:58.750
No.

13:58.834 --> 14:02.208
No, there comes a point in a man's life
when he has to stop running...

14:03.000 --> 14:04.291
And start begging.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.000
Oh...

14:07.083 --> 14:09.083
great, dead pirate.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.041
Will you please...

14:15.083 --> 14:16.208
Back to running.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.333
We're going back to running.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.250
I can't cook anymore, man.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.041
I made a thousand tamales today.
I'm all cooked out, man.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.250
- I'm cooked out!
- Jerry, calm down.

14:32.291 --> 14:33.959
I have a plan to get us out of here.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.834
See that machine over there?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.750
It's an old automatic tamale maker.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.250
Every time I've gone on a bathroom break,
I've worked on it.

14:41.709 --> 14:44.000
I made some adjustments
with some parts of a bicycle

14:44.083 --> 14:45.709
and I linked it to the remote
on my keychain.

14:46.542 --> 14:48.125
- What's it gonna do?
Jerry.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.375
I wanna talk to you.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.417
You become almost
as good a cook as Milton.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.667
We are opening another location in Texas.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.667
You going there.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.375
He's not going anywhere.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.625
Come on, Milton. This could
be a great opportunity for me.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.792
We're done cooking for you.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.583
Oh, is that right?

15:38.333 --> 15:39.625
Let's go home, Jerry.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.083
Uh, hey, so you'll let me know
about the whole Texas thing?

15:43.166 --> 15:44.667
- We're going home, Jerry.
- Okay.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.709
Go! No, quick, this way!

15:53.542 --> 15:54.959
Okay, we were wrong about that way!

15:55.041 --> 15:55.875
Not that way.

15:55.959 --> 15:57.041
- Let's go this way.
- Okay.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.166
Not that way.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.208
Uh, let's go that way.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.291
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

16:01.709 --> 16:02.959
Excuse me.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.625
Ghost pirates, if there's any more of you
coming from this general dire...

16:05.709 --> 16:06.834
Oh, no, okay, here they are.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.041
What are we gonna do, man?

16:10.125 --> 16:11.291
Arr!

16:11.417 --> 16:13.542
I told you to get off me wharf!

16:27.417 --> 16:29.625
Rudy, we can't hit them
but they can hit us.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.834
Oh, that is so not fair.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.542
Wait, this makes no sense.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.000
I can hit some of them but not others.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.500
I bet I can hit this one.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.875
Nope, didn't hit that one.

16:55.125 --> 16:59.041
Go and never return!

17:10.375 --> 17:11.417
Wait, that's it.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.375
That's it, Rudy. They're being projected.

17:13.792 --> 17:16.125
Some of the ghosts aren't real.
They're just holograms.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.917
Of course.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.583
You can't hurt me. You're just a hologram.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.750
That one's not a hologram.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.834
Don't go up there.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.667
It's scary.

17:36.125 --> 17:39.166
No, wait, wait, it's really scary.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.166
Oh, come on, man! Please?

17:46.875 --> 17:48.041
Hey, Jack.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.291
Weirdest thing...

17:49.375 --> 17:53.542
The ghosts locked us in here
and forced us to host a radio show.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.000
- One sec.
-

17:56.125 --> 17:57.166
And we're back.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.709
That was "Lighthouse Love"
going out to Dwight from Wanda.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.542
And now a word from our sponsor.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.583
Pick up some Snappy Cat cat food
and put some snap in your cat.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.083
You were behind this whole thing?

18:15.792 --> 18:19.208
Hey, the two real guys ran away
once the holograms disappeared.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.125
Ty?

18:24.166 --> 18:25.375
Oh.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.834
I see what's going on here.

18:27.667 --> 18:31.417
The pirate ghosts forced you to host
some sort of demonic radio show.

18:33.542 --> 18:34.917
Ty was behind everything.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.709
I told you, Rudy, ghosts aren't real.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.792
He tricked us by using
holograms and real people.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.250
Hmm...

18:41.333 --> 18:43.542
The old projected-hologram-pirate-ghost-

18:43.625 --> 18:46.917
mixed-with-non-projected-living-man-
dressed-like-a-pirate-ghost routine.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.542
I didn't know what else to do.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.917
I thought if I scared you off,
my students might come back.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.583
So, I used the myth of the lunar eclipse

18:55.250 --> 18:58.875
and spent the last of my savings on this
state-of-the-art hologram projector.

19:01.291 --> 19:04.458
Yeah, this is getting a little awkward.
I think I'll just step out.

19:05.709 --> 19:06.792
Oh, uh...

19:06.875 --> 19:09.625
Name's Shecky Gorkman,
demonic voice impersonator.

19:10.625 --> 19:13.250
Oh, I knew you sounded familiar.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.583
Weren't you the voice of that angry
baby in those diaper commercials?

19:17.208 --> 19:19.667
Change me, mommy.

19:22.417 --> 19:23.500
Please don't call the police.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.542
There's gotta be some way
I can make it up to you guys.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.375
Ty, it's not just us.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.375
You ruined Pirate Fest,
and cost people a lot of money.

19:31.709 --> 19:32.917
How are you gonna make it up to 'em?

19:34.792 --> 19:36.083
I think I've got an idea.

19:42.458 --> 19:46.250
Hey, kids. Juts five bucks to play
Blast the Pirate.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.667
Who's next?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.083
This is a great idea, Rudy.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.125
This will make up for the
all the money that was lost.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.458
Nice shot.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.583
There you go.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.250
I don't want the panda.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.542
I want that big banana.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.500
I thought you turned off
the holographic projector?

20:41.166 --> 20:42.333
I did.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.417
I think we learned something
very important today.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.625
What's that?

20:46.709 --> 20:48.458
I really am ghost candy.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

21:00.125 --> 21:01.208
Yo, what is this thing?

21:01.291 --> 21:03.500
It's the latest in hologram
projection technology.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.458
It can generate up to
50 different characters.

21:05.542 --> 21:06.834
Rudy said not to touch the settings.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.291
Oh...

21:09.375 --> 21:10.500
Hey, Julie.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.083
This is my new girlfriend, Tera.

21:12.166 --> 21:15.250
She's a supermodel and 100 percent real.

21:21.166 --> 21:24.583
You know, I'm just gonna leave you
two here for a little girl talk.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.917
Who touched the settings?

21:56.875 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.959 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
