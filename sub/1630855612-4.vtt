WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:10.552
Well that was another
great meal

00:10.552 --> 00:12.887
at the best hedgehog-inspired
drive-in restaurant

00:12.887 --> 00:14.764
on the motherfucking planet.
Sonic!

00:14.764 --> 00:16.725
Even I, the grouchiest shit
of the bunch,

00:16.725 --> 00:19.728
can't resist the oversized Texas
toast grilled cheese and a limeade.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.479
There's nothing sexier
than a chili dog

00:21.479 --> 00:22.564
delivered on roller skates.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.149
And we aren't even
being paid to say this.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.900
Sonic just fucking rules.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.068
Who's a good Benny dog?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.237
Kevin! I thought you were living
in an apartment

00:29.237 --> 00:30.321
by the Costco store.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.614
Hey, Solars. Yeah,

00:31.614 --> 00:33.658
I moved out of Kirkland's
Signature Village

00:33.658 --> 00:35.452
because the wife
and I got back together.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.370
Yeah, I thought I heard
some gentle humps

00:37.370 --> 00:39.622
and wet slurps poppin'
from your bedroom window.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.042
Oh, yeah, I've been
stirring pussy for weeks.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.044
And it's all thanks
to Benedog Cumberwolf here.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.714
This creature has facilitated
your coitus?

00:47.714 --> 00:48.840
He's a cockadoodle.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.550
Half cocker spaniel,
half poodle,

00:50.550 --> 00:52.552
specifically bred
to save marriages.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.305
He can smell when I'm about
to disrespect my wife.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.723
It works because
she's such a dumb bi--

00:57.849 --> 00:58.933
Good boy.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.144
You know how we've been
trying to find something

01:01.144 --> 01:02.395
that will complete
us as a family.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.772
- It's the theme of the season.
- Perhaps

01:03.772 --> 01:05.732
we should get
a Costco pet like Kevin.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.816
Isn't the Pupa a pet?

01:07.150 --> 01:08.234
He's more toddler than pet.
Look, he's watching

01:08.234 --> 01:09.861
Saturday morning cartoons
right now

01:09.861 --> 01:10.945
like a wee baby.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.447
The Pupa's never licked my face,

01:12.447 --> 01:14.532
which is something that all good
pets do to their owners.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.284
If we get a pet,
it needs to lick my face.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.786
Well, we can't get a dog.
They're narcs.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.870
They work for the police.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.872
Then we'll get the Bane
to the dog's Batman.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.956
A cat.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.291
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.501
What about the whole Alf thing?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.795
- Don't aliens eat cats?
- That's an offensive stereotype

01:26.795 --> 01:28.505
perpetuated by Hollywood liberals.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.507
The Solar Opposites
would never eat a cat.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.175
Then let's go get
a pet cat right now.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.928
It'll be a purr-manent
part of the family.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.932
Goddammit, we are like Alf!

01:39.808 --> 01:42.268
<i>Planet Shlorp was
a perfect utopia,</i>

01:42.268 --> 01:44.395
<i>until the asteroid hit.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:47.398
<i>One hundred adults and
their replicants were issued a Pupa</i>

01:47.398 --> 01:49.526
<i>and escaped into the... space,</i>

01:49.526 --> 01:51.986
<i>searching for new homes
on uninhabited worlds.</i>

01:51.986 --> 01:53.279
<i>We crashed on Earth,</i>

01:53.488 --> 01:55.198
<i>stranding us on an already
overpopulated planet.</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:57.158
<i>That's right, I've been talking
this whole time.</i>

01:57.158 --> 01:58.409
<i>I'm the one holding the Pupa.</i>

01:58.409 --> 02:00.078
<i>My name is Korvo.
This is my show.</i>

02:00.078 --> 02:01.371
<i>Bollocks, I just dropped
the Pupa.</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.456
<i>Ugh. This is ridiculous.
I hate Earth.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:04.541
<i>It's a horrible home.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:06.126
<i>People are stupid
and confusing.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:07.627
<i>Why do they dehydrate
so easily?</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:08.795
<i>Oh, you're in a bad mood</i>

02:08.920 --> 02:10.296
<i>because you didn't drink
enough water?</i>

02:10.296 --> 02:12.257
<i>Just sleep in a bowl of water,
you pussy.</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:19.305
Fuck.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.558
I can't believe we ate 22 cats
and a gerbil.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.143
Yeah, they really upsell you
on the gerbils.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.436
We need to think of pets
we won't be tempted to eat.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.981
So obviously nothing with fur
or cat organs.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.233
We need something that's not so cute
that we want to eat it

02:30.233 --> 02:32.527
but is still sorta cute
and will lick our faces.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.529
Getting face licked
is a real priority for me.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.697
MAN
<i>Dabba yabba yabba.</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:41.452
Dabba yabba yabba indeed.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.999
Jaxson, your word
to pronounce is

02:45.999 --> 02:48.751
A-L-U-M-I-N-U-M.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.336
Can you use it in a sentence?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.714
No, because then
I'd be pronouncing it.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.424
Nice fucking try.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.260
Aluminork?

02:58.761 --> 02:59.929
Jaxson, you idiot.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.306
That was so wrong. Jesse,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.933
get this right
and you're going to regionals.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.394
Your word is W-A-T-E--

03:06.394 --> 03:07.478
Watermelon!

03:07.478 --> 03:08.897
No points for early guessing.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.981
But that's correct.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.776
I want my mom.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.238
Listen up, Opposites.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.158
Regionals will be your
toughest competition yet.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.202
You'll be up against
the winners from Philadelphia.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.120
People from Philly famously have

03:24.120 --> 03:25.872
the best pronunciation
in the country.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.956
Take these.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.041
Ooh.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.084
Wait, are these cassette tapes?

03:30.084 --> 03:32.253
I think I saw these
in a museum once.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.713
Don't they sound terrible?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.006
Focus on the competition.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.090
You'll do fine,

03:36.341 --> 03:37.592
as long as your family
has your back.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.010
And for your information,

03:39.135 --> 03:41.304
music sounds better with the
hiss of a magnetic strip.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.598
We will never beat
the sound of a tape.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.183
<i>You want me to what?</i>

03:45.183 --> 03:46.768
- For you to make us a deeno-saur.
- We wanna

03:46.768 --> 03:47.852
- We wanna make-a da deeno.
- Make-a da deeno

03:48.144 --> 03:50.772
with a-spicy a-sauce.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.316
Make-a da deeno,
make-a da deeno, make-a da deeno.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.111
make-a da deeno, make-a da deeno
make-a da deeno!

03:57.111 --> 03:59.197
<i>Shut up.
Why are y'all talking in those</i>

03:59.197 --> 04:01.157
<i>janky Mario Brothers accents?</i>

04:01.157 --> 04:02.242
'Cause it's fun.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.785
Heaven forbid
the Solar Opposites have

04:03.785 --> 04:05.495
a pepperoni of fun for once.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.372
<i>Look, I can't just make
a living creature.</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:09.082
But what if you use
the Quantum Injector?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.751
- You're just making words up now
- The thingy we used to make Funbucket.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.835
Yeah, that shit's canon.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.462
<i>Ooh, I forgot about that.</i>

04:14.462 --> 04:16.005
<i>So what kinda deeno-saur
you want?</i>

04:16.005 --> 04:18.091
A pinch of Hanna
and a dash of Barbera.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.550
It has to lick my face,
no exceptions.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.094
And it should be clever
and get our jokes.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.262
And laugh when we laugh.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.138
And it should know
where the camera is at all times

04:24.138 --> 04:25.682
and give occasional
sly winks to it.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.976
<i>Stand back and let me do
my shit, you dummies.</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:41.030
KORVO/YUMYULACK/TERRY:
Yay, deeno.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.825
Deeno, deeno, deeno.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.413
What the cheese and crackers
is going on here?

04:48.413 --> 04:49.497
And who is that?

04:49.497 --> 04:50.915
That's our new deeno.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.042
You guys got a pet
without asking me?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.295
We assumed you'd, like,
fallen in a sewer or something

04:55.295 --> 04:57.422
and were dealing with,
I don't know, sewer stuff.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.383
I was competing
at the Pronunciation Bee,

05:00.383 --> 05:01.676
which you guys said
you'd come watch.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.386
Lick Jesse's face.
Lick it, lick now.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.723
Ugh. I don't have
time for this.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.474
I have to get ready
for regionals.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.268
Again, how many regions
are there? A thousand?

05:10.268 --> 05:12.812
This deeno better not
interrupt my studying.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.648
I'm sure the deeno will behave
in a completely different way

05:15.648 --> 05:17.692
than the only way
we've seen him behave so far.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.779
You see that shit?
Good boy.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.074
Dandelion.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
Chaperone.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.328
Light saber.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.704
Butt cheek.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.916
Would you please keep it down?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.960
We're doing madcap
race car driving with the deeno.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.962
Look, we even have
our dastardly mustaches.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.465
The deeno's getting away.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.799
Follow him into that
brand new tunnel.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.427
Hey.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.476
Help.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.561
How do I do the thumb thing?

05:53.561 --> 05:55.521
Guys? Guys, come on.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.606
A little help.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.568
Honestly, the string
doesn't help me study,

06:00.568 --> 06:02.070
but it does look nice.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
Oh, cheese nuts.
What is it now?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.492
We're solving
a Scooby-Doo mystery.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.410
That park ranger said
he knew the time,

06:09.410 --> 06:10.912
but why would he say time

06:10.912 --> 06:12.330
unless he's in the clock

06:12.330 --> 06:13.831
that we've
never established before.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.292
Boo!

06:19.128 --> 06:20.380
I suppose you're wondering

06:20.380 --> 06:22.215
why I went through
all this trouble.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.758
Just get the fuck outta here.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.260
One, two.
A one, two, three, four.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.263
<i>♪ The Deeno and the Opposites ♪</i>

06:29.263 --> 06:32.392

06:32.392 --> 06:34.310

06:34.310 --> 06:36.062
Okay, okay. Stop, stop.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814
Just rocking from
the heart isn't working.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.898
We need to write some lyrics.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.191
No! Keep rocking.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.613
Deeno.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.073
Your guys's band practice

06:47.073 --> 06:48.783
ruined my study session
last night,

06:48.783 --> 06:50.910
and now I really have to cram.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.036
Where are my tapes?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.373
<i>♪ The Deeno and the Opposites ♪</i>

06:55.373 --> 06:56.999
You taped over my tapes?

06:56.999 --> 06:59.502
We had to make a demo
if we want to get a record deal

06:59.502 --> 07:01.295
- for our Deenosaur band.
- Yumyulack watched

07:01.295 --> 07:03.423
the bass player from
Fall Out Boy's master class.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.217
These tapes were
the only way I had to starky,

07:06.217 --> 07:07.427
I mean, uh, study.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.846
Oh, no, I'm already

07:10.930 --> 07:12.432
mispro-- mis--

07:12.432 --> 07:13.724
Dammit!

07:13.724 --> 07:15.101
Jesse, you need to
chill out, sit down,

07:15.393 --> 07:17.353
and have one of these
breakfast burritos the deeno made.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.771
Though there aren't
any chairs open now.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.398
The deeno's sitting
where you usually do.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.858
Also, there's no
more burritos.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.068
He only made six for
the six members of the family.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.153
Little buddy.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.279
Guess who forgot about you!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.363
Let's all resume laughing.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.242
Uh-oh, Jesse's mad.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.493
Deeno, give her another
face lick.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.079
No!

07:41.919 --> 07:44.338
Hey, paleontologists,
you got a minute?

07:44.338 --> 07:46.090
Oh, little girl,
you must be lost.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.259
The mummy exhibit is
in the other hall.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.679
I'm actually looking for someone
to answer some deeno questions.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.389
Really?
Kids usually don't care much

07:53.389 --> 07:54.849
about dinosaurs these days.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
They're all obsessed
with ancient Egypt.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.603
"Can I TikTok this hieroglyph?"

07:58.603 --> 08:00.897
"Can I WhatsApp this
sarcophagi?"

08:00.897 --> 08:01.981
Makes me sick.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.691
Dinosaurs are so cool.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.151
God, how I love these bones.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.236
Now it's all about
thirst trap selfies

08:07.236 --> 08:08.404
with fucking Imhotep.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.489
What can we do for you?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.074
Well, I'm actually
from Hollywood.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.576
We're working on a story

08:13.576 --> 08:16.162
and need to know
how could someone get rid

08:16.162 --> 08:18.998
of an annoying deenosaur
without anyone knowing?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.084
Mm, you could always get
another dinosaur to eat it.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.169
That's not gonna work.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.171
Well, the only thing
that was strong enough

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
to kill the dinosaurs
other than bigger dinosaurs

08:27.757 --> 08:29.800
was the asteroid
that destroyed their world.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.888
That is exactly what I require.

08:34.305 --> 08:37.433
Damn, that girl can pronounce.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
Sayonara, you Jurassic fuck.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.423
How have I let things get
so out of control

09:09.423 --> 09:13.010
that I'm about to do a murder
on the deeno with an asteroid?

09:13.010 --> 09:15.096
This isn't me.
I'm sorry, little guy.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.597
The truth is, the only reason

09:16.597 --> 09:18.724
I tried so hard with the
Pronunciation Bee

09:18.724 --> 09:20.810
is to make the family like me.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.520
And it felt like
you were replacing me,

09:22.520 --> 09:25.189
but you're just a friendly
deeno pup.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.109
Enjoy your
cartoonishly large ribs.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.490
Bad move, you stupid bitch.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.992
Deeno, you can talk?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.619
I've been able to talk this
whole time, and you were right.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.205
I was trying to replace you
in the family.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.290
Oh, crap.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.374
When AISHA made me,

09:43.624 --> 09:45.501
the Hanna was all
the sweet friendliness.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.752
She never should've tainted it

09:46.752 --> 09:48.838
with the malevolence of Barbera.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.173
You've been faking being nice?

09:51.173 --> 09:54.677
This plan's been
65 million years in the making.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.554
Welcome to Earth, shit bag.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.264
Sword time, motherfucker.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.765
Terry, what are you doing?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.183
I was coming to kill the deeno
because I thought

10:01.183 --> 10:02.727
he was replacing me
in the family.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.478
What, no way, I did too.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.606
Die, die, die.
Korvo?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.149
Now what are you doing here?

10:08.149 --> 10:11.444
Uh, definitely not getting ready
to smash the deeno

10:11.444 --> 10:12.695
with the holiday hammer
because I thought

10:12.695 --> 10:14.280
he was replacing me
in the family.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.741
Hey, that's how I
was feeling too.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.660
We were all jealous
of the deeno, as a family.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.412
That means we all love
each other and--

10:21.412 --> 10:22.538
Pupa?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.790
Are you bringing Deeno
a nice bowl of chili?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.334
What the shit, Pupa?

10:26.334 --> 10:27.501
You little traitor.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.128
Would you grow
some self-doubt, Pupa?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.212
Wait a second.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.965
It's full of broken glass.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.092
The Pupa was trying to kill
the deeno, too.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.552
There we go.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.429
It doesn't matter,
you stupid twats.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.348
I'm sick of all your
alien bullshit.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.350
Earth belongs to earthlings.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.684
Your whole species is extinct.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.353
We made you with alien science.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.230
Shut up. This time, the asteroid's
gonna help the dinosaurs

10:48.230 --> 10:49.899
by killing you so Little Buddy

10:49.899 --> 10:52.360
and I can have the house
all to ourselves.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.403
You and Little Buddy
have teamed up?

10:54.403 --> 10:56.030
Yeah, buddy.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.490
That is so fucked.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.533
Jesse, pronounce this.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.244
D-I-E.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.954
Hey, neighbors.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.956
Sorry to walk in your backyard
in the middle of night.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.041
But I was wondering--

11:12.171 --> 11:13.839
Good boy.
Run!

11:27.061 --> 11:28.396
How does that gun even work?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.189
Where are all these
asteroids coming from?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.692
I was sure we were dead
after that beam turned

11:32.692 --> 11:34.193
our space station
into cigarettes,

11:34.193 --> 11:36.654
but luckily we had one thing
we needed to stay alive.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.780
Hope.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.785
I can't believe
we all hated the deeno.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.370
I really thought you
guys loved him.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.372
I assumed having a pet
would bring us together,

11:46.372 --> 11:48.874
when what we really needed
was something we all hated.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.960
When did you guys
turn on the deeno?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.837
I knew as soon as he popped
out of the machine.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.922
I was just waiting for my sword
to come in from West Elm.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.343
So how should
we stop-a da deeno?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.428
I've got it.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.596
Everyone hang on to your Tuts.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.723
What?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.316
Come out, come out,
little aliens.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.819
My sight is based on movement,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.447
and I wanna see you
fuckers dance.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.757
Oh, it's okay.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.300
That's just part of the exhibit.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.551
Well, this isn't.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.761
You're trapped.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.970
Come on, Jesse. Little Buddy

12:42.970 --> 12:44.430
and I are gonna turn your room

12:44.430 --> 12:45.723
into a cigar lounge.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.224
- No.
- What about our room?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.976
That'll be our jerk-off zone.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.270
I told you that space would make
a great jerk-off zone.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.521
You say that about every room.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.318
Looks like you're
fresh out of asteroids.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.904
Oh, no problem.
I'll just eat you.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.447
Nice try, but you're
a herbivore.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.782
Fuck, I'm all smart.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.492
Terry, we're plants.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.576
Wait, we are?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.247
Is that supposed
to scare me?

13:10.247 --> 13:11.999
The only reason we're here

13:11.999 --> 13:13.209
is because I remembered

13:13.209 --> 13:15.961
who loves deeno bones
more than anything.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.255
Who is that?
Show yourself.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.842
Oh. Mm, the girl is right.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.636
We love dinosaur bones.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.722
But they're always
so dry and fossilized.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.182
You've got wet bones.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.100
Paleontologists.
Stay back!

13:30.100 --> 13:32.436
Wait, wait, stop. I'm a living dinosaur.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.271
Observe me.
Learn from my behaviors.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.356
We-- we can work together.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.691
If we wanted to study
living things,

13:37.691 --> 13:39.527
we would've been zoologists.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.487
Wet bones. Wet bones.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.988
Wet bones.
Bones!

13:47.201 --> 13:48.410
Everyone, be cool.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.246
Don't do anything
to piss them off.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.330
We've got this.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.665
Oh, an Egypt exhibit.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.291
Run!

13:58.212 --> 14:00.130
I'm so proud that you
took first prize.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.383
You pronounced
the hell out of that shiz.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.469
There it goes.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.804
Aw, thanks, guys.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.807
I'm just glad we were
all there together.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.725
That's what family is for.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.185
Now let us clutch each other
in a manner

14:13.185 --> 14:14.478
that demonstrates affection.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.731
Hey, you can't be
part of the hug.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.024
You teamed up with the deeno.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.901
Little Buddy?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.486
Don't pretend like
it never happened.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.363
We know exactly what
to do with you.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.824
AISHA, prepare the cryo pod.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.325
We're launching Little Buddy
into space.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.661
<i>The cryo pod's gone, dummy.</i>
Fucking what?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.330
<i>Remember, you used it
to shoot that guy into space.</i>

14:33.330 --> 14:35.541
<i>That whole crystal skull
vodka bullet thing?</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:39.086
I, I think I remember
something about that.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.046
Crap. Well, I guess
we'll just toss Little Buddy

14:41.046 --> 14:42.298
down the garbage disposal.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.383
What was that guy's name?
That we shot into space?

14:44.383 --> 14:46.260
Who cares.
We'll never see him again.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.182
Little Buddy?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.263
Looks like an incoming storm.
Time to clear out.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.431
But what about the suspect?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.433
What, the human?
It's been three days.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.560
There's no way he survived
out there in the wild.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.145
This case is closed.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.697
Day three. The last of
the Silvercops have left the planet.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.823
I'm here all alone.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.408
It's cold, I'm hungry,

15:51.408 --> 15:53.577
and I'm already on my fourth
pair of leaf underwear.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.331
I'm scared, and I miss
you so much, baby.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.208
I wish I was inside
you right now.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.585
I love you, Honda S2000.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.671
I would do anything
to run my hands

16:03.671 --> 16:05.047
over your faux leather interior
and listen to the

16:05.047 --> 16:06.507
<i>Fast and Furious</i> soundtrack

16:06.507 --> 16:08.592
while recklessly weaving
through rush hour traffic.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.970
So hungry.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.892
If only I could reach
the flying fish.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.395
What the fuck?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.146
That looks like an evil cloud.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.984
It is an evil cloud.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.443
Shit, shit, shit!

16:27.736 --> 16:29.863
Oh, this is just like that part
in <i>Hobbs and Shaw.</i>

16:29.863 --> 16:32.116
Wait, no, no. Wait, which of
the <i>Fast and Furious</i> movies

16:32.116 --> 16:33.325
was the one where they
were gonna unleash the gas?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.660
Was that <i>Fast Five?</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.334
The fruit.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.915
It worked.
This fruit saved my life.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.208
Mm. Plus it

17:23.208 --> 17:24.960
tastes like
a mango slush from Sonic.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.378
Hey, thanks for the tip,
little bro.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.841
Space monkey shit.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.595
Night four.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.056
Or five or ten or I don't know.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.308
Ever since those silver fucks
tried to frame me,

17:39.308 --> 17:40.601
the only good thing
that's happened

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
is realizing I can eat
the alien leech

17:42.186 --> 17:44.104
I find attached to my scrotum
every morning.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.356
Definitely weird my first
instinct was

17:46.356 --> 17:48.233
to eat this, but

17:48.233 --> 17:49.318
it's worked out.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.324
Oh, hey there, little fella.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.034
Oh.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.161
Nice to see some friendly
faces for once.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.371
Aren't you a bunch
of little cuties.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.956
Ow!

18:11.965 --> 18:13.675
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

18:13.675 --> 18:15.135
I'm now missing two toes,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.554
and hiding in a gross
alien tree.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
This is my rock bottom.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.935
This is my <i>2 Fast 2 Furious.</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:48.335
So that's what that feels like.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.045
Doesn't get any worse than that.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.717
Oh, shit!

19:05.269 --> 19:06.353
Shit, shit, shit.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.333
Fuck me.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.543
This thing's a tomb.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.798
Fuck you.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.550
I can't do this anymore.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.010
It's too fucking much!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.015
My watch, my car.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.976
I just wanna get it
over with and die.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.064
Yo, bro. It's time to sack up.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.149
Dom Toretto?

19:52.149 --> 19:54.443
Glen, are you gonna
die in here

19:54.443 --> 19:56.361
crying like a little bitch

19:56.361 --> 19:59.031
or you gonna go fight
that creature?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.325
There's nothing I can do.
That's a sky shark.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.993
I'm a pathetic ground human.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.788
Don't you remember what I
learned in <i>Fast and Furious 13:</i>

20:06.788 --> 20:08.081
<i>Race to Atlantis?</i>

20:08.081 --> 20:09.875
<i>Familia,</i> Glen.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.710
<i>Familia's</i> inside you.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.337
But also outside.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.923
And sure,
you can forget about <i>familia,</i>

20:15.923 --> 20:19.676
but <i>familia</i> ain't forgetting
about you.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.053
Okay, but what does any
of that mean?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.264
Just go out there and use a car
to fight that shark.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.557
Vroom, vroom.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.517
