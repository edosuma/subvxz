Hey, Luke, over here!

00:44.497 --> 00:45.997
Dude, where the hell
have you been?

00:46.048 --> 00:48.767
Luke, finally.
What took you so long?

00:48.834 --> 00:51.887
I was busy, okay?

00:51.971 --> 00:53.472
Lighten up, man.

00:53.523 --> 00:54.856
Probably fighting
with Emily again.

00:54.941 --> 00:56.725
So where is she anyway?

00:56.809 --> 00:58.193
Grounded.

00:58.277 --> 01:00.395
Seriously? Why?

01:00.480 --> 01:02.397
There is no why.
Her dad's mental.

01:02.482 --> 01:03.448
Something must've

01:03.516 --> 01:05.400
made him go
all Guantanamo on her.

01:05.485 --> 01:07.702
Hey, let's go liberate her.
Come on!

01:07.787 --> 01:08.787
Courtney, leave it alone.

01:08.854 --> 01:09.871
You'll just get her
in more trouble.

01:09.956 --> 01:12.374
Besides, her dad
hates me enough already.

01:36.482 --> 01:37.549
Yeah, I'm gonna wake him up?

01:37.600 --> 01:39.050
I was aiming for her window.

01:39.101 --> 01:40.402
Which one's hers?

01:41.771 --> 01:43.721
Up there. The one
that's kind of open.

01:43.773 --> 01:44.823
That one?

01:48.394 --> 01:49.411
Oh, my God, seriously?

01:49.495 --> 01:51.863
What?

02:06.546 --> 02:08.847
Emily?
Shh!

02:15.855 --> 02:18.523
Okay, "boo" on three.

Hey, Joe.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.626
Thought you might need a ride.

03:52.785 --> 03:57.289
It was your second trip
to Japan in two months.

03:57.356 --> 03:58.573
What can I say?

03:58.658 --> 04:02.410
I'm a sucker for karaoke.

04:02.495 --> 04:03.745
Something on your mind?

04:03.829 --> 04:07.198
Hiro Noshimuri.

04:07.249 --> 04:11.169
HPD has evidence that
he was murdered, Joe.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.754
Now, I'm not
directly involved

04:12.838 --> 04:15.090
with the investigation,
but I'm told

04:15.174 --> 04:16.558
they're starting to look at you.

04:16.642 --> 04:20.644
I did not kill Hiro Noshimuri.

04:20.713 --> 04:21.879
We had a conversation,

04:21.930 --> 04:23.565
and when it was over,
he walked away.

04:23.649 --> 04:25.150
If he's dead,

04:25.217 --> 04:26.718
HPD should be looking at Wo Fat.

04:26.769 --> 04:30.388
Why would Wo Fat want to kill
the head of the Yakuza?

04:30.439 --> 04:32.407
Shelburne.

04:32.491 --> 04:35.577
Did Noshimuri tell you
who Shelburne is?

04:35.661 --> 04:37.729
No, but Wo Fat might think
otherwise.

04:37.780 --> 04:39.397
The problem is,
you were the one

04:39.448 --> 04:41.866
who was seen taking
Noshimuri at gunpoint.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.235
HPD isn't gonna
just let this go.

04:44.286 --> 04:46.121
Apparently, neither is
the Yakuza. We got company.

05:18.437 --> 05:19.788
Hang on!

05:49.518 --> 05:51.936
Hey, what have we got?

05:51.987 --> 05:53.822
Victim's a 17-year-old
girl, Emily Winter.

05:53.906 --> 05:56.741
M.E. thinks that she was smothered
with a pillow from her own bed.

05:56.809 --> 05:58.159
17 years old,
what does that make her,

05:58.244 --> 05:59.911
a junior
in high school?

05:59.978 --> 06:01.145
Yeah. Ala Moana Academy.

06:01.197 --> 06:02.980
I hate this job.

06:03.032 --> 06:04.199
Yeah.

06:04.283 --> 06:05.283
Bruising on her wrists.

06:05.334 --> 06:07.085
Like she was restrained.

06:07.152 --> 06:08.086
Probably pinned down.

06:08.153 --> 06:09.153
What's the time
of death on this?

06:09.205 --> 06:10.839
Emily's dad saw her

06:10.923 --> 06:12.841
at 10:30 p.m. when she came
to her bedroom,

06:12.925 --> 06:14.592
and her friends found her here
at around 1:00 a.m.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.511
Her dad was here?

06:16.595 --> 06:18.713
Yeah, he was here all night.
He didn't hear a thing.

06:18.781 --> 06:20.849
No sign of forced entry,
but we have an open window.

06:21.884 --> 06:24.669
Easy access in and out.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.321
Hopefully,
the killer left evidence.

06:26.388 --> 06:28.106
Yeah, but even
if he did,

06:28.173 --> 06:30.391
it might not still be there;
it turns out

06:30.459 --> 06:32.677
this window was more popular
than the front door.

06:32.728 --> 06:34.896
The kids who found her
snuck in through it.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.365
They also told a uni that Emily
was supposed to be at a party

06:37.450 --> 06:38.700
last night,
but she didn't show

06:38.784 --> 06:40.201
'cause she was grounded,
but they don't know why.

06:40.286 --> 06:41.870
Those kids still here?

06:41.954 --> 06:44.622
They're on the lanai. I was just
about to go talk to them.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.541
Good. What about her dad?

06:46.625 --> 06:50.578
I never thought I'd say this...

06:50.663 --> 06:54.716
I'm glad her mother didn't live
to see this day.

06:54.800 --> 07:00.755
She died of cancer
when Emily was ten.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.724
I'm sorry.

07:02.808 --> 07:06.728
Is there, uh, anyone I can call

07:06.812 --> 07:08.313
or anything
I can do?

07:08.380 --> 07:11.099
My sister's coming over.

07:11.183 --> 07:13.551
She's... on her way.

07:13.602 --> 07:16.321
Emily was
everything to me.

07:19.525 --> 07:25.413
She ways looked at the world
with a smile...

07:25.498 --> 07:27.499
no matter what.

07:28.751 --> 07:30.034
Smart, too.

07:30.085 --> 07:33.872
She had a full academic
scholarship at Ala Moana.

07:33.923 --> 07:36.240
She sounds like
a very special girl.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.792
Excuse me. Sir,

07:37.877 --> 07:40.345
I'm Steve McGarrett,
Five-O.

07:40.412 --> 07:42.297
I'm very sorry for your loss.

07:42.381 --> 07:45.416
I just need to ask you
a couple questions

07:45.467 --> 07:46.551
if that's okay.

07:48.470 --> 07:51.255
Sir, can you think of anybody
who'd want

07:51.307 --> 07:52.974
to do something like this
to your daughter?

07:53.058 --> 07:57.278
No. No, everyone loved Emily.

07:57.363 --> 07:58.429
Everyone.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.783
She'd never been
in any kind of trouble.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.701
Except...

08:03.769 --> 08:05.436
Except what?

08:05.487 --> 08:09.874
She'd never done anything
like this before, ever.

08:09.942 --> 08:15.697
A couple of weeks ago, she-she
stole a check from my wallet.

08:15.764 --> 08:17.782
She made it out to cash:

08:17.833 --> 08:19.717
$5,000.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.387
Did you... did you confront her?

08:22.454 --> 08:23.621
She admitted taking it,

08:23.672 --> 08:26.057
but she refused to say why.

08:26.124 --> 08:28.176
She wouldn't tell you
what the money was for?

08:28.260 --> 08:29.727
She said
she needed it

08:29.795 --> 08:32.897
to help a friend; I'm sure it
had something to do with Luke.

08:32.965 --> 08:35.066
And who is Luke?

08:35.133 --> 08:36.985
Luke is her boyfriend.

08:37.068 --> 08:41.022
He's arrogant,
he's, he's entitled.

08:41.106 --> 08:44.993
I wouldn't put it past him to
convince Emily to steal for him.

08:45.077 --> 08:46.361
<i>All right, we should</i>

08:46.445 --> 08:47.612
really check out
the boyfriend.

08:47.663 --> 08:50.331
Come on. Really, I mean,
what father actually likes

08:50.416 --> 08:51.833
his daughter's high school
boyfriend?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.625
What are you talking about?
My dad did.

08:53.626 --> 08:54.281
No, he didn't.

08:54.286 --> 08:56.070
Yeah, he did.
My mom, too. He's great.

08:56.138 --> 08:57.372
What was he, a eunuch?

08:57.456 --> 09:00.124
Hey, listen. According
to the kids who found Emily,

09:00.175 --> 09:02.176
her and her boyfriend Luke
had been fighting.

09:02.261 --> 09:03.761
About what, they don't know.

09:03.829 --> 09:05.847
What we do know is that
Luke was supposed to be

09:05.931 --> 09:07.131
at a party on the
beach last night,

09:07.182 --> 09:08.600
but he didn't show up
until almost midnight.

09:08.667 --> 09:09.801
Yeah, and he also didn't show up
here with the other kids.

09:09.852 --> 09:11.102
He actually tried to talk them
out of coming.

09:11.169 --> 09:12.854
Okay, we need to check
this guy out.

09:13.672 --> 09:15.106
Kono.

09:15.173 --> 09:17.191
Yeah, got it. Thanks.

09:17.276 --> 09:20.812
Okay, so we got a hit off one of
the prints off Emily's window:

09:20.863 --> 09:22.363
Luke Preston.
Kid's got a record.

09:22.448 --> 09:25.533
Okay, now I <i>do</i> want to talk.

09:29.905 --> 09:33.458
Luke, get out here now!

09:33.525 --> 09:35.326
Is he in trouble?

09:35.377 --> 09:37.695
We just want to ask him
a couple questions.

09:37.746 --> 09:38.713
He'll be right out.

09:38.797 --> 09:40.832
Luke, now!

09:42.468 --> 09:43.718
He's a good boy.

09:43.802 --> 09:46.054
Spirited, but a good boy.

09:46.138 --> 09:48.873
Mrs. Preston, we know
he has a record.

09:48.924 --> 09:53.094
Oh, that?
That was a family thing.

09:53.178 --> 09:57.048
Luke borrowed the Porsche
without permission,

09:57.099 --> 09:59.901
so I called the cops, you know,
just to teach him a lesson.

09:59.985 --> 10:02.737
He's 18,
so it went on his record.

10:02.821 --> 10:05.556
You do realize using
law enforcement

10:05.607 --> 10:08.109
as a disciplinary tool
is a bad idea, right?

10:13.065 --> 10:14.866
Luke!

10:15.784 --> 10:17.702
Hey, Luke!

10:17.753 --> 10:19.420
Luke, open the door!

10:24.426 --> 10:25.793
Call 911!

10:29.131 --> 10:32.600
This is Officer Kalakaua.
I need an ambulance now.

10:32.685 --> 10:34.018
Come on, Luke! Come on!

10:44.138 --> 10:45.715
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:45.716 --> 10:46.982
How's Luke?

10:46.997 --> 10:49.398
Well, he's awake now.
Doc says we can go see him.

10:49.450 --> 10:50.641
He said he OD'd
on a combination

10:50.642 --> 10:52.126
of alcohol and
benzodiazepine.

10:52.177 --> 10:53.460
They pumped his stomach.

10:53.512 --> 10:55.262
Is he gonna be okay?

10:55.313 --> 10:57.481
Yeah. He's a lucky kid.

10:57.566 --> 10:58.916
It was stupid.

10:58.984 --> 11:02.353
I was upset and drunk.

11:02.437 --> 11:03.838
And then this morning, I, uh...

11:03.905 --> 11:05.706
I got a text from Jake.

11:05.774 --> 11:07.374
About Emily.

11:07.442 --> 11:08.976
And I just flipped out, and...

11:09.027 --> 11:10.861
you know, grabbed some pills
from my mom's stash,

11:10.946 --> 11:13.998
and that's when
you showed up.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.818
Is it true?

11:17.869 --> 11:19.820
Is she really dead?

11:19.871 --> 11:21.756
That's why we're here.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.707
I can't believe it.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.042
Would you believe it

11:25.127 --> 11:27.595
if I told you I found your
prints on her windowsill?

11:27.662 --> 11:28.929
I used to sneak into

11:28.997 --> 11:31.098
her bedroom through
that window all the time.

11:31.166 --> 11:34.501
Her dad was
completely oblivious.

11:34.553 --> 11:36.720
- That what happened last night?
- Hey.

11:36.805 --> 11:38.005
Look, man...

11:38.056 --> 11:40.057
Hey, "sir," all right?
You call me sir.

11:40.142 --> 11:41.776
You got that?
Look, it's not what you think.

11:41.843 --> 11:43.677
You fight with
Emily last night?

11:43.728 --> 11:46.147
- Do I need a lawyer?
- Hey!

11:47.365 --> 11:49.867
That girl is dead.
You answer my question.

11:49.951 --> 11:51.351
Did you fight
with her last night?

11:51.403 --> 11:53.287
Yes.

11:53.354 --> 11:54.705
But I didn't hurt her.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.957
I would never hurt her.

11:57.025 --> 12:00.544
You know about the money
Emily stole from her father?

12:00.629 --> 12:01.712
That's what we were
fighting about.

12:01.797 --> 12:03.363
Did she steal the money for you?

12:03.415 --> 12:05.800
No! No.

12:05.867 --> 12:09.003
That's what her dad thought,
but it wasn't true.

12:12.057 --> 12:13.557
I didn't need $5,000.

12:13.642 --> 12:17.711
Okay? And even if I did, I'd
steal it from my own parents.

12:17.762 --> 12:19.880
Trust me, they'd never notice.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.932
All right, so who
was the money for?

12:22.017 --> 12:24.018
She wouldn't tell me.

12:25.437 --> 12:27.771
She wouldn't tell anybody.

12:27.856 --> 12:29.773
<i>Well, you can't blame</i>

12:29.858 --> 12:31.909
Emily's dad for
not liking this kid.

12:31.993 --> 12:33.160
Really?
I kind of liked him.

12:33.228 --> 12:34.495
What, are you kidding me?

12:34.562 --> 12:36.614
He really seemed to
care about Emily.

12:36.698 --> 12:38.332
Anyway, I don't like him
for the murder.

12:38.399 --> 12:41.068
He doesn't strike me as the type
who'd kill with his bare hands.

12:41.119 --> 12:43.087
We need to find out
who that money was for.

12:43.154 --> 12:45.422
<i>Emily's locker 279.</i>

12:45.507 --> 12:47.074
It should be up here
on the left.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.293
Wow, this...
this is high school, right?

12:49.377 --> 12:51.846
I mean, this has me
feeling very nostalgic.

12:51.913 --> 12:53.180
Mm. I hated high school.

12:53.248 --> 12:54.181
You?

12:54.249 --> 12:55.850
You seem like
the smart type, right?

12:55.917 --> 12:57.468
Like the president
of the student council.

12:57.552 --> 12:59.526
What, you think I was
like Tracy Flick?

12:59.527 --> 13:00.250
That was a compliment.

13:00.255 --> 13:02.523
Oh, I'm sure you
were, like, a jock.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.693
No, no, but I, uh, I did chase
all the cheerleaders.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.445
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:10.315 --> 13:12.366
What are we looking for?
Okay.

13:17.272 --> 13:20.440
Looks like a close friend.
If anybody's gonna know what's

13:20.492 --> 13:23.327
going on with Emily, it's this
girl. We gotta get a name.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.162
Mr. Summers is
the headmaster.

13:25.247 --> 13:26.413
We'll go talk to him.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.249
At the front, they said
he's doing an assembly.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.450
Come on.
Okay.

13:30.502 --> 13:34.138
The days and weeks ahead are
going to be very difficult.

13:34.222 --> 13:38.976
Loss is never easy, and, uh...

13:39.060 --> 13:41.128
a loss like this, it's...

13:41.179 --> 13:45.733
it's not something we're ever
fully prepared to accept.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.237
So... we have counselors,
teachers and staff

13:50.305 --> 13:53.473
standing by to help you
through the grieving process

13:53.525 --> 13:55.743
any way that we can.

13:55.810 --> 13:57.795
24/7.

13:59.147 --> 14:01.315
A tragedy has struck
at the heart of our community,

14:01.366 --> 14:03.918
but we will get
through this...

14:03.985 --> 14:06.337
together.

14:06.421 --> 14:08.422
So, if you feel like

14:08.489 --> 14:10.490
you need to speak to
a counselor now, please do.

14:10.542 --> 14:14.044
Otherwise, please proceed
to your class.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.130
That's it, guys.
Dismissed.

14:23.471 --> 14:24.888
Hey.

14:24.973 --> 14:26.890
Mr. Summers.
I'm Danny Williams.

14:26.975 --> 14:29.360
Lori Weston.
We're with Five-O.

14:29.444 --> 14:31.278
We're investigating
Emily's homicide.

14:31.346 --> 14:33.697
She was a great kid.

14:33.782 --> 14:35.199
Had her whole life
ahead of her.

14:35.283 --> 14:37.901
Straight A's, no attitude,
no trouble.

14:37.986 --> 14:39.570
Any idea who did this
to her, or...?

14:39.654 --> 14:42.706
No, but we were, um, hoping
you could help us with this.

14:42.791 --> 14:44.625
Do you know who this girl is?

14:44.692 --> 14:47.211
That's, uh, Karen Sargent.

14:47.295 --> 14:49.196
She and Emily
are inseparable--

14:49.247 --> 14:51.382
BFFs, as the kids say today.

14:51.466 --> 14:53.300
All right. Well, we're
going to need to speak to her,

14:53.368 --> 14:54.868
if that's okay.
Sure.

14:54.919 --> 14:57.838
I'll, uh, pull her out of class
as soon as I call her father.

14:57.889 --> 14:59.039
Actually, we'd, um,
we'd like to

14:59.090 --> 15:00.424
speak to her alone,
if that's okay.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.559
She's not a suspect,

15:02.644 --> 15:04.928
or anything like that;
we just need to talk to her.

15:05.013 --> 15:06.180
But she is a minor.

15:06.231 --> 15:08.015
I am required to
notify a parent.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.433
Okay.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.435
Anything you have to say
to Karen, you can say to me.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.053
So... Go ahead.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.439
Okay. Uh...

15:15.523 --> 15:17.441
So, Karen, we know
about the money that

15:17.525 --> 15:19.326
Emily stole
from her father.

15:19.394 --> 15:21.445
- What money?
- It was $5,000.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.364
Emily wouldn't tell
her father what it was for,

15:23.415 --> 15:24.782
but we're hoping Karen will.

15:26.368 --> 15:29.236
I don't know what
they're talking about.

15:29.287 --> 15:32.456
Karen, Emily was your best
friend, and she was murdered.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.075
Okay? We think
it might have something

15:35.126 --> 15:38.012
to do with who
the money was for.

15:38.079 --> 15:40.681
She just said she doesn't know
anything about it.

15:40.748 --> 15:42.766
Okay, sir, please.
Just give her a second.

15:45.136 --> 15:47.938
I know that you
and Emily were close.

15:48.023 --> 15:50.924
And I know that you want
to do the right thing.

15:50.975 --> 15:53.944
So, please, just tell us
everything you know.

15:59.551 --> 16:02.269
Okay, that's it.
She's been through enough.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.038
Let's go.

16:08.209 --> 16:10.127
<i>- The Yakuza knows</i>
<i>- HPD is circling Joe.</i>

16:10.211 --> 16:11.545
They were sending a message.

16:11.612 --> 16:13.047
Steve, Joe's in real trouble.

16:13.131 --> 16:17.167
Okay. I'll reach out to Adam
Noshimuri. He's in charge now.

16:17.252 --> 16:18.469
Maybe you should
reach out to Joe.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.137
Joe told me he
didn't kill Hiro.

16:20.221 --> 16:24.007
Okay. I know you trust him...
Of course I trust him.

16:24.092 --> 16:25.676
I mean, he's like
a father to me.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.562
When my father wasn't around,
he was. For years.

16:28.629 --> 16:30.848
But that was a long time ago,
Steve. People change.

16:30.932 --> 16:32.683
How much do you
really know

16:32.767 --> 16:34.818
about his life over
the last ten years?

16:34.903 --> 16:36.636
He saved my life, Chin.

16:36.688 --> 16:37.804
More than once.

16:37.856 --> 16:39.857
I get that. I do.

16:39.941 --> 16:41.641
But I'm telling you,
he's hiding something.

16:41.693 --> 16:43.911
Why does he keep
going to Japan?

16:43.978 --> 16:45.913
What does he really know
about Shelburne?

16:45.980 --> 16:49.833
And do you really believe
he didn't kill Hiro Noshimuri?

16:53.955 --> 16:56.156
I'm just saying you might not
know the whole story.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.493
Hey, guys.
You need to see this.

16:59.544 --> 17:01.545
I got something
off Emily's computer.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.348
So...

17:05.433 --> 17:07.518
I know who the $5,000 was for.

17:07.585 --> 17:09.419
Karen Sargent.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.938
She sent a frantic
e-mail to Emily

17:11.005 --> 17:12.723
a couple weeks ago, saying
she was being blackmailed.

17:12.807 --> 17:13.941
Blackmailed for what?

17:14.008 --> 17:16.393
For this.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.346
Wow.

17:19.396 --> 17:20.864
It's a screen grab
from a sex tape.

17:20.949 --> 17:22.782
The blackmailer said that he
would post the video online

17:22.849 --> 17:24.067
if she didn't
pony up $5,000.

17:24.152 --> 17:25.452
Karen was terrified

17:25.520 --> 17:27.488
her parents would
find out.

17:29.524 --> 17:30.741
Yo.

17:30.809 --> 17:32.075
All right, guys.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.195
Emily gave the money to
a friend of hers, Karen Sargent.

17:35.246 --> 17:36.463
Karen's the one
Emily was protecting?

17:36.531 --> 17:37.531
Yeah, she was being

17:37.582 --> 17:39.049
blackmailed over a sex tape.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.135
We just tried to talk to Karen;
she was a brick wall.

17:41.202 --> 17:42.252
Well, now you know why.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.037
We've got eyes on her now.

17:44.088 --> 17:46.857
All right, listen, we have
an ID on the blackmailer yet?

17:46.925 --> 17:48.725
Not yet. It might be the guy
she was having sex with.

17:48.810 --> 17:49.927
Maybe he made the sex tape

17:50.011 --> 17:51.512
without her consent,
and then used it

17:51.563 --> 17:53.380
to try and squeeze
some cash out of her.

17:53.431 --> 17:55.382
Wait a minute. Why would Karen
be protecting this guy?

17:55.433 --> 17:56.817
Especially if he killed
her best friend?

17:56.884 --> 17:58.068
Well, if she's in love
with the guy,

17:58.153 --> 17:59.269
she might be in denial.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.720
Yeah, because he's
such a lovable guy.

18:00.772 --> 18:02.990
You have obviously never
been a 17-year-old girl.

18:03.057 --> 18:04.825
- All right, listen.
- Here's the problem.

18:04.892 --> 18:07.494
If we go back to Karen,
her father's gonna get a lawyer.

18:07.562 --> 18:09.997
Okay, she might not be
talking to us or her dad,

18:10.064 --> 18:11.331
but she's gotta be
talking to somebody.

18:11.399 --> 18:12.899
And I'm thinking
it's the blackmailer.

18:12.951 --> 18:14.618
Okay. She's going
for her phone right now.

18:16.321 --> 18:17.838
Hold up, hold up,
hold up.

18:17.905 --> 18:19.022
What are you doing?

18:20.208 --> 18:22.009
Getting the cell interceptor.

18:22.076 --> 18:23.677
It'll pick up the number
she's dialing.

18:23.744 --> 18:24.845
Where did you get that?

18:24.912 --> 18:26.096
In the trunk.

18:26.181 --> 18:27.848
How'd you know that thing
was in there?

18:27.915 --> 18:29.967
How did you <i>not</i> know
it was in there?

18:30.051 --> 18:32.319
Okay. Number is: 808-

18:32.387 --> 18:34.271
555-0136.

18:34.355 --> 18:37.524
Okay, I'm running it now.

18:37.592 --> 18:39.860
Um... Okay, so it's assigned
to a prepaid cell.

18:39.927 --> 18:41.028
No name.

18:41.095 --> 18:42.813
But I'm activating GPS.

18:44.148 --> 18:46.366
All right, we got a location
on the phone.

18:46.434 --> 18:48.402
Looks like whoever Karen is
talking to is in a vehicle.

18:48.453 --> 18:52.122
The guy's on the move, okay?
So let's go. Let's go, let's go!

18:52.190 --> 18:54.191
♪

19:09.891 --> 19:12.309
Hey. Out of the car
with your hands up.

19:13.344 --> 19:14.978
Out of the car.

19:17.015 --> 19:18.398
What's going on?

19:25.336 --> 19:27.354
- I want a lawyer.
- You do...

19:28.063 --> 19:29.147
want a lawyer?

19:29.198 --> 19:31.182
I want to bound your head
off this cement wall.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.817
How 'bout I get what
I want and you don't?

19:32.868 --> 19:34.118
- What do you think?
- He can't do this.

19:34.186 --> 19:35.236
No?

19:35.320 --> 19:38.373
Looks to me like
he can, actually.

19:38.457 --> 19:40.241
I haven't done anything wrong.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.711
Okay, uh...
this is where we disagree.

19:43.796 --> 19:45.630
Okay, I think that sleeping
with little girls

19:45.697 --> 19:46.631
is definitely wrong.

19:46.698 --> 19:48.416
It's not what you think.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.251
No?
Karen is 17 years old.

19:50.335 --> 19:52.637
Age of consent
in Hawaii is 16.

19:52.704 --> 19:54.756
She's legal.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.874
Can I hit him once?
Please?

19:56.925 --> 19:58.092
Shut your mouth, all right?

19:58.177 --> 19:59.260
What happened?

19:59.344 --> 20:01.133
Emily find out about
your little affair?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.354
Is that what happened?
Is that why you killed her?

20:02.379 --> 20:03.097
No!

20:03.098 --> 20:06.234
- Is that why you killed her?!
- I didn't kill her!

20:08.103 --> 20:09.887
Okay, Emily knew about
my relationship with Karen,

20:09.938 --> 20:11.388
but she wasn't going to
tell anyone.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.573
How do you know that?

20:12.658 --> 20:14.075
Because she came to see me.

20:14.159 --> 20:15.576
She told me I had to

20:15.661 --> 20:18.696
break it off with Karen, but
because somebody else knew.

20:18.747 --> 20:20.898
Wait a minute.
Emily confronted you like that?

20:20.949 --> 20:25.236
Yes. She said... she
had to protect Karen,

20:25.287 --> 20:29.006
that it was something she
felt like she had to do, and...

20:29.074 --> 20:30.758
It was a couple days
later, after that,

20:30.843 --> 20:33.911
I got an e-mail demanding money.

20:33.962 --> 20:36.681
Okay, so you're saying you were
being blackmailed as well.

20:36.748 --> 20:39.100
There was a tape.

20:39.184 --> 20:41.185
At first I thought
Karen made it,

20:41.253 --> 20:43.521
but she was just as
mortified by it as I was.

20:43.588 --> 20:45.523
Okay, so wait a minute.
You didn't make the tape.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.475
Karen didn't make...
Who made the tape?

20:47.559 --> 20:48.759
I don't know.

20:48.811 --> 20:51.479
But I think Emily
figured out who it was.

20:51.563 --> 20:55.149
And I think she confronted him
just like she confronted me...

20:55.234 --> 20:58.536
and then he killed her.

21:01.790 --> 21:02.957
McGarrett.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.158
What?

21:04.243 --> 21:06.244
I'll be right there.

21:08.413 --> 21:10.965
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>you need more evidence?</i>

21:11.049 --> 21:15.086
I'm telling you I saw Joe White
take my father at gunpoint.

21:15.154 --> 21:16.587
Last time I checked,
that's kidnapping.

21:16.655 --> 21:18.589
Guys. Thanks for the call.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.425
Where's he at? He at the back?

21:21.493 --> 21:24.061
Hey. Hey.
Why are you protecting him?

21:24.129 --> 21:25.396
I'm here to see a friend.

21:25.463 --> 21:27.982
Okay?
Well, your friend killed my father.

21:28.066 --> 21:29.183
You got proof of that?

21:30.235 --> 21:32.603
Look, we both know
what happened.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.856
You just don't
want to believe it.

21:42.447 --> 21:43.915
Hey.

21:43.982 --> 21:45.132
Give me a minute?

21:45.134 --> 21:46.701
Yeah, sure.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.878
You gotta come clean
with these guys.?

21:56.962 --> 21:58.495
I mean, you know
that, right?

21:58.547 --> 21:59.663
You gotta tell them everything.

21:59.715 --> 22:02.216
What is it you want
me to tell them?

22:02.301 --> 22:04.835
Why you went to see Noshimuri...

22:04.887 --> 22:06.687
why you were the last person
seen with him

22:06.772 --> 22:07.939
before he disappeared.

22:08.006 --> 22:08.940
You're interfering
with something

22:09.007 --> 22:10.057
that you don't understand.

22:10.142 --> 22:11.893
Then why don't you
explain it to me, Joe?!

22:11.977 --> 22:13.978
Tell me what the hell's
going on!

22:15.814 --> 22:17.064
You gotta wake up.

22:17.149 --> 22:18.900
The walls are closing in on you.

22:19.952 --> 22:23.955
HPD wants answers,
the Yakuza wants blood.

22:24.022 --> 22:26.290
Shelburne--
is he worth this? Huh?

22:26.358 --> 22:29.293
Is he worth going to jail for?
Is he worth dying for, Joe?

22:29.361 --> 22:30.878
People already died, son.

22:30.963 --> 22:32.547
I'm trying to make it stop!

22:38.503 --> 22:40.838
I'm getting out of here.
Cops got nothing on me.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.562
You gonna give me a ride,
or do I have to call a cab?

22:51.716 --> 22:53.985
I figured out how
that sex tape was made,

22:54.052 --> 22:56.070
and how your anonymous
blackmailer accessed it.

22:56.154 --> 22:59.323
Summers' computer was
infected with spyware

22:59.358 --> 23:01.242
that remotely activated
its webcam.

23:01.326 --> 23:02.843
As simple as that?

23:02.911 --> 23:04.912
Pretty much. The spyware
was a Trojan Horse

23:04.997 --> 23:06.397
attached to a file containing

23:06.448 --> 23:07.865
the Ala Moana Academy's
"Lookbook."

23:07.916 --> 23:09.733
It's kind of like
a digital yearbook.

23:09.785 --> 23:12.253
Okay, so Summers
downloaded the Lookbook,

23:12.337 --> 23:14.071
and then...

23:14.122 --> 23:16.424
And then he and Karen
must've had sex

23:16.508 --> 23:18.242
in view of the laptop's camera.

23:18.293 --> 23:21.429
And neither one of them knew
they were being watched,

23:21.513 --> 23:22.579
or recorded.

23:22.631 --> 23:24.265
That's really creepy.

23:24.349 --> 23:25.916
Moral of the story:

23:25.968 --> 23:29.387
resist the urge to have sex
in front of an open laptop.

23:31.139 --> 23:32.640
Sometimes you scare me.

23:32.724 --> 23:34.725
The other thing is...

23:34.776 --> 23:36.727
I got an IP address for
the blackmail e-mails.

23:36.778 --> 23:38.512
They both trace back
to the computer lab

23:38.580 --> 23:41.282
at Ala Moana Academy.
Not sure if that helps.

23:41.366 --> 23:42.533
You know what, it might.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.768
When I was in high school,
we had to sign in

23:44.820 --> 23:46.103
to use the school computers.

23:46.154 --> 23:47.872
Thanks, Fong.

23:47.939 --> 23:49.740
<i>We got your name</i>
<i>from the sign-in sheet,</i>

23:49.791 --> 23:51.442
and we were wondering
if you can remember

23:51.493 --> 23:53.494
who was using that computer
right before you.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.329
Yeah, someone signed in
using a bogus name,

23:55.414 --> 23:56.964
so we just need to talk to him.

23:57.049 --> 23:58.449
Oh, man, that's totally lame.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.501
I have a pretty good memory,
'cause I'm a journalist--

24:00.585 --> 24:02.253
editor of the school
paper and all that--

24:02.304 --> 24:03.971
but that was finals week.

24:04.056 --> 24:05.306
It's all kind of a blur.

24:05.390 --> 24:07.475
I remember I was just glad
to snag a computer at all.

24:07.559 --> 24:09.060
Place was packed.

24:12.064 --> 24:13.648
Oh, yeah. I've, uh...
seen this thing around.

24:13.732 --> 24:14.765
What is this?

24:14.816 --> 24:16.400
It's just this thing
called the Lookbook.

24:16.468 --> 24:18.352
It's nothing... it's just
this thing that has pictures

24:18.437 --> 24:19.403
of all the students on it.

24:19.471 --> 24:21.972
Cool. Where'd you get it?

24:22.991 --> 24:25.493
Made it.

24:25.577 --> 24:27.912
Uh, Jared, we're gonna have to
ask you to come down to HQ...

24:27.979 --> 24:30.147
Oh, come on.
Really? Is he serious?

24:42.494 --> 24:45.763
I knew I shouldn't have upped
my asking price to ten grand.

24:45.830 --> 24:47.831
Who ratted me out?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.686
Exactly how many people
are you blackmailing?

24:51.770 --> 24:53.888
Right now, about seven or eight.
Things pick up around exams.

24:53.972 --> 24:55.806
You'd be surprised
how many cheating,

24:55.857 --> 24:58.275
sex-crazed drug addicts
are at my school.

24:58.343 --> 25:01.068
There was a laptop on the desk
in Emily Winter's bedroom.

25:01.069 --> 25:02.769
Yeah, do you know if she
download the Lookbook?

25:02.794 --> 25:04.194
Yeah, I had a live feed

25:04.349 --> 25:05.983
on her computer,
but I stopped monitoring it.

25:06.034 --> 25:07.568
That chick was
a total snoozefest.

25:07.652 --> 25:09.653
All she ever did in her bedroom
was her homework.

25:09.705 --> 25:10.788
And sleep.

25:10.855 --> 25:12.990
Okay. Emily was murdered
in her bedroom.

25:13.041 --> 25:15.493
She was?

25:15.544 --> 25:18.129
Man, if I'd known that...

25:18.196 --> 25:19.580
Wait, can you pull up
the footage

25:19.664 --> 25:22.049
from the night she was killed?
Yeah.

25:27.806 --> 25:29.807
Fast-forward.
- I'll tell you when to stop.

25:32.894 --> 25:34.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:34.646 --> 25:36.046
Slow down.

25:36.098 --> 25:37.264
Okay.

25:38.316 --> 25:39.984
Oh, my God.

25:49.611 --> 25:51.912
This killer's organized,

25:51.997 --> 25:54.115
cold, efficient...
not the work of a kid.

25:54.199 --> 25:55.899
No. More like
a professional hit.

25:57.819 --> 25:59.837
Okay, stop.

26:08.493 --> 26:10.694
I ran him through every
facial recognition database

26:10.719 --> 26:12.819
I could find, and I got a hit
with Interpol.

26:12.847 --> 26:14.281
Killer's name
is Michael Angelico.

26:14.348 --> 26:15.582
I've heard of this cat.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.067
He's like a hit man for the mob.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.368
No.
Angelico was never affiliated

26:18.436 --> 26:19.686
with any particular
crime family.

26:19.737 --> 26:20.737
He's just a hired gun.

26:20.822 --> 26:22.656
He was on a DOD watch list,

26:22.707 --> 26:26.026
suspected in five or six hits
over the last two decades.

26:26.077 --> 26:27.411
Never been arrested.

26:27.495 --> 26:29.379
We came across
his work in Chechnya.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.547
He's good at what he does.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.332
The best. According
to sources at the time,

26:32.383 --> 26:35.502
his fee started at $250,000
and went up from there.

26:35.553 --> 26:36.870
Okay, none of this makes sense.

26:36.921 --> 26:38.705
Who hires a hit man
to kill a teenage girl?

26:38.756 --> 26:39.856
Well, it doesn't
look like Angelico's

26:39.924 --> 26:41.858
gonna be able to answer
that question for us.

26:41.926 --> 26:43.376
According to TSA,
he's in the wind.

26:43.428 --> 26:47.014
Left two hours after Emily's
murder on a flight to Manila.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.815
I've got the surveillance
footage here.

26:50.018 --> 26:51.118
That's him.

26:51.185 --> 26:52.269
Stop right there.

26:52.353 --> 26:54.187
Stop, stop. Push in
on the boarding pass.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.475
Name on the ticket
is David Savage.

26:58.543 --> 27:00.694
All right,
so homeboy's got an alias.

27:00.745 --> 27:03.113
Okay, let's use this to track
hotel reservations,

27:03.197 --> 27:04.865
car rentals...
anything else we can think of

27:04.916 --> 27:06.399
that will help us
retrace his steps

27:06.451 --> 27:07.868
while he was on
the island, okay?

27:07.919 --> 27:09.836
He may be gone, but this
might help us figure out

27:09.904 --> 27:11.338
who hired him. We've got to
get back to Emily's dad.

27:11.405 --> 27:12.289
Want any help?

27:12.373 --> 27:13.423
No. Uh...

27:13.508 --> 27:15.292
Why don't you just
head back to your place,

27:15.376 --> 27:16.426
keep a low profile.

27:16.511 --> 27:18.462
I'll call you later. Okay?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.751
I've never seen him
before in my life.

27:24.802 --> 27:27.554
You're telling me that this is
the man who killed my daughter?

27:28.556 --> 27:29.523
A hit man?

27:29.590 --> 27:31.641
Yes, sir.

27:31.726 --> 27:33.477
I don't understand.

27:33.561 --> 27:35.729
Mr. Winter, do you, uh...

27:35.780 --> 27:38.482
do you have any enemies that
could do something like this?

27:38.566 --> 27:39.983
Enemies? Guys,
I'm a physical therapist.

27:40.068 --> 27:42.903
Okay, anything, uh,
strange at work lately?

27:42.954 --> 27:44.788
- Anything at all?
- No, nothing.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.290
I haven't even been at work.
I've been on jury duty.

27:47.375 --> 27:51.328
What, uh... what was
the case that you were on?

27:51.412 --> 27:52.996
A small civil case.
It was...

27:53.081 --> 27:55.632
a construction worker who
broke his leg on the job.

27:55.716 --> 27:58.085
He's suing for medical
expenses, lost wages.

27:58.136 --> 27:59.402
And he won the case?

27:59.470 --> 28:02.005
I don't know.
It wasn't over yet.

28:02.090 --> 28:04.958
They were just starting
closing arguments...

28:05.009 --> 28:06.760
when Emily died.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.795
The judge, he just
let you off, or..?

28:08.846 --> 28:11.348
Yeah, he was very...
very understanding.

28:13.101 --> 28:15.068
Excuse me.

28:17.105 --> 28:18.989
Okay, look, I know
what you're thinking,

28:19.073 --> 28:21.141
but... really?
A trial over a broken leg?

28:21.192 --> 28:23.193
I mean, it doesn't seem like
the smoking gun here.

28:23.277 --> 28:26.312
No, you generally don't hire
a hit man for that, but...

28:26.364 --> 28:29.983
what if this entire case was
about forcing a mistrial?

28:33.271 --> 28:34.838
<i>That was so sad,</i>

28:34.906 --> 28:37.707
about Juror Number Seven's
daughter... what was his name?

28:37.792 --> 28:39.292
- Greg Winter.
- Right.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.760
Okay, I was under the impression

28:40.828 --> 28:42.679
that something like this would
probably cause a mistrial. No?

28:42.763 --> 28:45.498
No, we just seated an alternate
juror in his place.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.600
It was pretty straightforward.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.354
Wait a minute,

28:51.439 --> 28:52.689
is that the defense team?

28:52.773 --> 28:54.357
I know, can you believe it?

28:54.442 --> 28:56.476
That's a lot of lawyers.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.478
Hedsten Construction--
that's the defendant--

28:58.529 --> 29:00.313
they pulled out all
the stops on this one.

29:00.364 --> 29:03.400
Flew all the lawyers
in from New York.

29:03.484 --> 29:04.818
Morgan, Frick & Dunne.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.454
Bunch of Ivy League hotshots.

29:07.521 --> 29:09.406
Even sprang for
Owen Sutherland,

29:09.490 --> 29:11.191
the island's most expensive
jury consultant.

29:11.242 --> 29:13.526
Hold on. I thought
this case was no big deal.

29:13.578 --> 29:14.711
It isn't.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.713
It's a $150,000 claim, tops.

29:16.831 --> 29:19.049
But they wouldn't even talk
settlement with my client.

29:19.133 --> 29:22.636
Doug was part of a crew on
a 16-unit apartment building.

29:22.703 --> 29:25.388
He broke his leg when
the balcony gave way, and...

29:25.473 --> 29:27.641
They're claiming he was
negligent, but come on...

29:27.708 --> 29:29.259
the balcony fell off
the building.

29:29.343 --> 29:32.596
Okay. Do you have new
Juror Number Seven's name?

29:32.680 --> 29:35.232
Yeah.

29:35.316 --> 29:36.766
Ray Donovan.

29:36.851 --> 29:38.068
Thank you.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.721
Well, if Angelico rented
this car, he cleaned it out.

29:41.772 --> 29:42.873
It's spotless.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.658
Yeah. Rental agent says
they clean all the cars

29:44.725 --> 29:45.775
within 24 hours of return.

29:45.860 --> 29:49.329
They also wipe the GPS
for customer privacy.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.664
Oh, how considerate.

29:50.731 --> 29:52.616
- Wait a minute.
- I'm sure our killer appreciates it.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.417
Valet stub.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.569
It's date stamped.

29:56.621 --> 29:59.039
There's an address.

30:33.941 --> 30:36.876
Steve, we got something
you need to see.

30:36.944 --> 30:40.330
That's 4225 Kane Street. Now,
according to the valet stub,

30:40.414 --> 30:42.799
we found on his car, Michael
Angelico visited someone

30:42.883 --> 30:44.668
in that building when
he was on the island.

30:44.752 --> 30:46.619
The only problem is,
we don't know who.

30:46.671 --> 30:49.372
Five companies lease
office space in that building.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.559
We've got two shrinks,
an accounting company,

30:52.626 --> 30:54.728
a day spa and a
consulting firm.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.280
Security sent over a photo

30:57.348 --> 30:58.848
of everyone who works
in the building.

30:58.916 --> 31:00.183
Wait a second.

31:00.268 --> 31:02.235
This guy. Blow him up.

31:03.254 --> 31:04.871
Okay, that's
Owen Sutherland.

31:04.939 --> 31:06.323
We saw him in court today.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.158
Yeah, he's the president and
CEO of Sutherland Consulting.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.076
That's right. According to
the plaintiff's attorney,

31:10.144 --> 31:13.330
he's the island's most
expensive jury consultant,

31:13.414 --> 31:15.031
and he's working
for the defense.

31:15.116 --> 31:16.992
That's gotta be who
our killer went to see.

31:16.993 --> 31:18.433
Okay, yeah.
But how do we prove it?

31:18.469 --> 31:19.986
We prove it with Juror
Number Seven, the one that

31:20.037 --> 31:21.321
filled in for Emily's father.

31:21.372 --> 31:23.023
You mean Ray Donovan?
We got something on him?

31:23.024 --> 31:23.552
Yeah.

31:23.557 --> 31:25.425
At first glance, guy seems like
a normal, working class guy.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.344
No record, nothing strange
about his financials.

31:27.428 --> 31:28.928
But his wife, on the other hand,

31:28.996 --> 31:30.597
she's a different story.

31:30.665 --> 31:32.682
She's a part-time dental
hygienist, all right?

31:32.767 --> 31:36.353
All of a sudden, she receives
a $50,000 wire to her

31:36.437 --> 31:37.687
personal checking account.
Let me guess:

31:37.772 --> 31:39.556
the timing of it had
something to do with

31:39.640 --> 31:42.025
Donovan being seated on the jury.
It came in that same day.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.177
And it all leads back
to Owen Sutherland.

31:44.228 --> 31:45.612
Okay. Let's go.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.730
Go where?
Where we going?

31:46.814 --> 31:48.815
Back to court.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.875
Hey, Sutherland.

32:01.045 --> 32:03.079
Five-O. Let's have a chat.

32:03.164 --> 32:05.415
It's been a long day, gentlemen.
Why don't you call my office,

32:05.499 --> 32:07.500
and, uh, we'll see
when we can fit you in.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.202
Well, we're fitting
ourselves in right now.

32:09.253 --> 32:10.387
How's that?

32:10.471 --> 32:13.256
Oh, forgive me, I had no idea
it was this urgent.

32:13.341 --> 32:15.592
Yeah, it's urgent.

32:15.676 --> 32:17.644
- How's the trial going?
- It's in the jury's hands.

32:17.711 --> 32:20.146
They started deliberations
this afternoon.

32:20.214 --> 32:21.314
Must've been a relief...

32:21.382 --> 32:24.317
to get Donovan
on the jury. Right?

32:24.385 --> 32:25.685
Relief?

32:25.736 --> 32:27.354
He was the alternate juror.

32:27.405 --> 32:29.689
We're just glad that
the judicial process

32:29.740 --> 32:31.724
seems to be working
the way it's supposed to.

32:31.776 --> 32:34.060
Oh, by the way, we know that
you, you met with David Savage.

32:34.111 --> 32:36.562
Oh, sorry...
you called him Michael?

32:36.614 --> 32:39.065
Excuse me, I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:39.116 --> 32:41.734
You don't? You know about
the $50,000 that landed in

32:41.786 --> 32:43.169
Donovan's wife's
checking account?

32:43.237 --> 32:45.588
You're lucky I'm in a good mood,

32:45.673 --> 32:47.841
otherwise I might take offense
at that accusation.

32:47.908 --> 32:50.243
There's a money trail, and
it's gonna lead back to you.

32:50.294 --> 32:53.129
If you really believe that,
you're delusional.

32:53.214 --> 32:54.431
How do you sleep at night,

32:54.515 --> 32:56.683
knowing that you murdered
a little girl? Huh?

32:56.750 --> 33:00.753
How much did Hedsten pay you
to deliver that verdict?

33:00.805 --> 33:02.255
Was it worth it,
that blood money?

33:02.306 --> 33:04.774
We're done here.

33:04.859 --> 33:05.975
It's been a pleasure, gentlemen.

33:06.060 --> 33:08.344
See you soon.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.932
We gotta find Donovan.

33:12.983 --> 33:14.818
Donovan's not gonna talk.

33:14.885 --> 33:17.036
That depends how we ask
the questions.

33:28.249 --> 33:28.998
Ray Donovan.

33:38.949 --> 33:41.082
Who are you?
What do you want?

33:41.083 --> 33:42.500
Owen Sutherland
sent us.

33:42.584 --> 33:43.751
He wants to make sure

33:43.819 --> 33:45.420
he's getting his money's
worth out of you.

33:45.487 --> 33:47.622
I don't know anyone named
Sutherland. You got the wrong guy.

33:47.673 --> 33:49.173
Oh, we got
the right guy.

33:49.258 --> 33:50.842
You know where
you are, Ray?

33:50.909 --> 33:52.260
I'll tell you.

33:52.327 --> 33:53.661
You're standing on the edge

33:53.712 --> 33:55.830
of an 80-foot drop
down to a rocky shore.

33:55.881 --> 33:57.215
Stick your foot out.

33:57.299 --> 33:59.217
Please!
Put it out.

33:59.301 --> 34:00.668
You feel anything, huh?

34:00.719 --> 34:01.686
No, please don't push me!

34:01.770 --> 34:03.137
I'm doing everything
Sutherland wanted.

34:03.188 --> 34:04.722
Like what, Ray?
What are you doing?

34:04.807 --> 34:06.724
I'm making sure no one
on the jury's looking at the steel.

34:06.809 --> 34:10.194
No one's even asking
any questions about it.

34:10.279 --> 34:11.396
Yeah? What else?

34:11.480 --> 34:13.063
I'm keeping 'em focused

34:13.148 --> 34:15.065
on Doug's safety violations.
It's working.

34:15.150 --> 34:17.118
I swear it's working.
You'll get your verdict.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.619
That's great, Ray.
Thanks, buddy.

34:18.687 --> 34:20.688
No! No!

34:20.739 --> 34:22.889
You're an animal.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.882
Okay.

34:30.966 --> 34:32.216
Good news is,
you're alive.

34:32.301 --> 34:34.635
Bad news is,
you're under arrest.

34:34.703 --> 34:35.703
Book him, Danno.

34:35.754 --> 34:37.804
Come on.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.376
<i>Ray Donovan was</i>
<i>actually telling</i>

34:42.428 --> 34:44.378
the truth: this case <i>is</i>
all about the steel.

34:44.429 --> 34:46.397
Hedsten is just
a subsidiary

34:46.482 --> 34:48.565
of a much larger company called
DeHavlen Construction.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.485
And DeHavlen
supplied Hedsten

34:50.552 --> 34:52.603
with the steel they used
in that apartment building.

34:52.688 --> 34:54.938
Nothing wrong with that except
the steel was supposed

34:55.023 --> 34:56.440
to come from Pittsburgh.

34:56.525 --> 34:59.127
DeHavlen falsified invoices
and substituted Chinese steel.

34:59.194 --> 35:00.778
Just pocketed
the difference.

35:00.863 --> 35:02.163
You got it.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.781
Chinese steel is not only
cheaper than the American stuff,

35:03.866 --> 35:04.999
it can also be substandard.

35:05.066 --> 35:06.751
So what you're saying is
because of bad steel

35:06.835 --> 35:08.002
that the balcony fell
off the building.

35:08.069 --> 35:09.737
Could mean the whole
building is unsound.

35:09.788 --> 35:10.838
Here's the kicker:

35:10.906 --> 35:12.707
Hedsten only used five percent

35:12.758 --> 35:14.292
of the steel girders
in that load.

35:14.376 --> 35:17.044
Five percent? What'd they do
with the rest of it?

35:27.189 --> 35:29.557
What do you think,
$800 million?

35:29.608 --> 35:31.526
Easy.
What do you think's

35:31.593 --> 35:33.093
going to happen
when it gets out

35:33.145 --> 35:34.295
that DeHavlen's using
substandard steel

35:34.363 --> 35:35.580
to build their city
of tomorrow?

35:35.697 --> 35:37.181
Somebody's gonna take
an $800 million bath

35:37.249 --> 35:38.366
is what's gonna happen.

35:38.433 --> 35:39.450
How you doing, man?

35:39.535 --> 35:41.702
We're looking
for the contractor,

35:41.770 --> 35:43.121
Bob Ledford. Is he around?

35:43.205 --> 35:45.289
He's up on the fifth floor
talking to a sup.

35:45.357 --> 35:48.376
Come on.

35:49.711 --> 35:50.878
You shouldn't be here.

35:50.946 --> 35:51.946
We need to talk.

35:51.997 --> 35:53.381
About what?

35:53.448 --> 35:55.082
You can't keep burying
your head in the sand.

35:55.134 --> 35:57.284
Look, I'm trying
to get a job done here.

35:57.336 --> 35:58.386
It's over, Bob.

35:58.453 --> 35:59.253
You don't know that.

35:59.304 --> 36:00.788
I am telling you it's over!

36:00.839 --> 36:02.306
What are you talking about?

36:02.391 --> 36:03.391
They know about
Donovan.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.675
About the payoff.

36:04.760 --> 36:05.626
That's on you!

36:05.677 --> 36:07.512
I never asked you
to pay anyone off.

36:07.579 --> 36:08.779
You wanted a guarantee!
I gave it to you!

36:08.847 --> 36:10.848
Hey, hey! Five-O!
You're both under arrest.

36:10.933 --> 36:12.266
Let me see both your hands.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.520
You stupid son of a bitch!

36:16.371 --> 36:17.338
Hey!

36:21.026 --> 36:21.976
H-H-Hey! Turn around.

36:22.027 --> 36:24.144
Down on your knees now. Now!

36:24.196 --> 36:26.647
Okay, listen to me.

36:26.698 --> 36:28.816
Give me your other hand.

36:28.867 --> 36:30.535
I can't.

36:35.657 --> 36:38.459
Give me your other hand.
Let me help you.

36:39.428 --> 36:41.212
Come on!

36:44.550 --> 36:46.434
Come on!

36:48.837 --> 36:49.754
No!

36:49.821 --> 36:51.222
No!!

37:25.057 --> 37:26.891
♪

37:53.368 --> 37:56.170
Just tell me what you did.

38:22.864 --> 38:24.231
Admit it!

38:27.769 --> 38:30.488
I did not...

38:30.572 --> 38:33.074
kill your father.

38:40.448 --> 38:43.551
Tell your men to put
their guns down right now, Adam.

38:43.618 --> 38:46.504
This has nothing
to do with you, McGarrett.

38:46.588 --> 38:48.889
Tell your men to put
their guns down,

38:48.957 --> 38:52.510
or I'm gonna put two
in your head right now.

38:52.594 --> 38:54.795
It's your last chance.

39:11.813 --> 39:14.031
Untie Joe.

39:17.285 --> 39:18.786
Do what he says.

39:24.793 --> 39:26.260
Let's go, Joe.

40:03.331 --> 40:05.716
You realize you just started
a war with the Yakuza.

40:05.801 --> 40:07.084
No, Joe, you did that

40:07.169 --> 40:08.586
when you grabbed
Hiro Noshimuri, okay?

40:08.670 --> 40:09.920
They think
you killed him.

40:10.005 --> 40:13.090
Well, I didn't kill him.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.511
I helped him fake his death.

40:19.564 --> 40:20.714
What?

40:24.152 --> 40:25.936
Why?!

40:26.021 --> 40:27.772
I can't tell you that.

40:33.829 --> 40:36.330
I was tortured over Shelburne.

40:36.397 --> 40:38.749
I was tortured!

40:40.168 --> 40:44.789
Joe, Jenna Kaye paid
with her life!

40:44.873 --> 40:46.841
I deserve answers.
I want answers.

40:46.908 --> 40:48.575
I want them right now.

40:50.045 --> 40:51.462
You know, son...

40:51.546 --> 40:54.682
there was a time when I'd have
had you up on charges

40:54.749 --> 40:56.217
of insubordination
for that.

40:56.268 --> 40:59.053
You know, we're not
in the service anymore, Joe,

40:59.104 --> 41:00.638
and you're
not my commanding officer.

41:00.722 --> 41:02.756
You're right.

41:04.359 --> 41:05.643
I'm not.
