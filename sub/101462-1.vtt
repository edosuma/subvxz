00:35.577 --> 00:39.161
Cj entertainment and
Dexter studios present

00:39.623 --> 00:43.161
a Dexter pictures production in association
with perfect storm film and cj entertainment

00:44.253 --> 00:46.209
to remove the remaining
6 icbm nuclear warheads,

00:46.213 --> 00:48.044
executive producers
Cho young-gi, Kim yong-hwa

00:48.131 --> 00:51.623
USS Watson will arrive in
chongjin port of North Korea.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.091
Produced by
Kim yong hwa, park ji sung

00:53.095 --> 00:58.010
this marks the final stage in the
denuclearization of North Korea.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.898
Lee byung hun

01:10.028 --> 01:13.191

01:14.616 --> 01:17.824

bae su zy

01:29.047 --> 01:37.047
ashfall

01:42.227 --> 01:44.434
Restrictions enforced,
public access blocked.

01:48.025 --> 01:51.643
This rusted monster in front of me

01:51.778 --> 01:55.942
is an an-m64 left over from the Korean war.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.692
Turn the trigger using
a pipe wrench then slowly...

01:59.786 --> 02:00.866
Remove it.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.286
Can you keep it down, man?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.659
I'm working here.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.995
An unexploded bomb is called
that because it never exploded,

02:11.089 --> 02:12.204
and I've never heard of a dud going off

02:12.215 --> 02:13.000
"tae-sik is ugly."
And I've never heard of a dud going off

02:13.008 --> 02:14.248
"tae-sik is ugly."
In my entire career at eod.

02:14.259 --> 02:14.668
In my entire career at eod.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.170
What's with him today?

02:16.261 --> 02:19.003
Probably pre-discharge jitters.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.179
I don't know why we even
bother wearing this.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.660
It's thick but it doesn't keep you warm.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.391
Still working.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.761
Of course.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.933
If you think about it,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.811
there's no job safer than ours.

02:31.902 --> 02:35.986
Ji-young just doesn't get that.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.945
Well, you're not coming out
to the field anymore.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.780
I feel like...

02:43.080 --> 02:45.036
I'm forgetting something today.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.488
The team dinner tonight?

02:46.583 --> 02:50.246
Ah, of course! I hope we're not
eating at the great wall again.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.577
We're eating at the great wall.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.292
I'm telling you, professor min
has a share in that place.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.674
But that's not it. There
was something else...

02:57.928 --> 03:00.761
Your husband is running late again?

03:01.264 --> 03:04.256
I don't know. Maybe he got called to a job.

03:05.435 --> 03:09.178
How come you won't tell me?

03:09.272 --> 03:11.809
You're really going to make me
wait until the 32nd week?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.891
That's the law.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.814
You'd think this was a
courthouse, not a hospital.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.562
Not much Patience left now?

03:18.657 --> 03:21.945
So is it a little prince or Princess?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.373
Captain Cho - 12 missed calls

03:34.673 --> 03:35.833
hey, cutie cute!

03:36.049 --> 03:38.005
So tell me, boy or girl?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.375
I'm sorry,

03:39.469 --> 03:40.208
do I know you?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.418
Come on, baby.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.970
I'm almost there, right around the corner.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.173
Did you get called out on a job?

03:46.351 --> 03:47.807
Um... no?

03:47.936 --> 03:51.224
How come you never tell me when
you're called out to the field?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.142
Because it makes you worry.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.435
I knew you got called out.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.690
From now on, they won't
call me even if I want to go.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.359
Now, what did the doctor say? Tell me.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.190
Tell you what?

04:03.452 --> 04:04.908
About our precious little...

04:05.036 --> 04:07.368
Oh, the doctor.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.200
I can't say because you were late again.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.123
- The bastard said that?
- It's a she.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.450
A girl? Really?

04:13.545 --> 04:15.001
No, the doctor is a she.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.954
Oh... well, that sucks...

04:18.550 --> 04:19.959
I'm getting in the elevator.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.696
I'll tell you when you get home.
Over and out.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.960
- But...
- Over and out.

04:24.014 --> 04:28.758
Now, our ytn correspondent
live in Pyongyang.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.343
I'm at the 425 cultural center where

04:31.438 --> 04:33.349
the workers' party
congress is taking place.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.931
High-level officials are present

04:36.026 --> 04:38.108
for the completion of the
denuclearization program,

04:38.195 --> 04:40.652
which will be confirmed and
officially announced foday.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.399
USS Watson will arrive at
chongjin port on the 16th

04:44.493 --> 04:48.577
to collect the last 6 remaining icbms.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.871
This action will showcase
complete denuclearization...

04:57.589 --> 05:01.628
As I speak, we're
experiencing an earthquake!

05:02.803 --> 05:05.761
The cultural center is being destroyed!

05:05.847 --> 05:06.882
I repeat...

05:07.557 --> 05:09.718
Oh, god! The 425 cultural center

05:10.727 --> 05:12.638
has collapsed!

05:24.991 --> 05:27.027
"Warning: 7.8 quake occurred.
Beware aftershocks."

05:52.519 --> 05:53.599
Ji-young!

07:00.587 --> 07:03.078
God...

07:48.176 --> 07:49.086
Breaking news.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.630
Baekdu mountain has erupted.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.257
It's magnitude 8, the
highest eruption class.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.879
"Maximum eruption class is vei-8"
ytn has exclusive footage.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.429
This disaster is estimated
to be of unprecedented scale.

07:58.436 --> 08:02.554
The earthquake has been confirmed as a 7.8.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.972
The entire Korean peninsula falls
within the quake's influence.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.474
Has announced a national disaster.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.526
Evacuation orders have been issued
in Seoul, gyeonggi, gangwon.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.192
Experts warn of more explosions fo come.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.150
With all airways blocked, major
roads have also been destroyed.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.489
The city of Pyongyang has burned fo ashes

08:17.580 --> 08:19.571
and fallen into a state of anarchy.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.603
The Chinese government is mobilizing
military around the Korea-China border

08:22.627 --> 08:24.288
under the tag of risk management.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.662
The white house has issued a strong
warning to China's military movement and,

08:27.757 --> 08:29.372
as of 10am kst, has announced

08:29.467 --> 08:32.424
an evacuation order for
us citizens in Korea.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.059
Professor kang bong-rae?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.480
Robert... I'm Robert...

08:54.242 --> 08:55.857
And no longer a professor.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.905
I just handed in my resignation.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.494
I'm jun yoo-kyung, senior
secretary to the president.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.623
What're you here for?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.163
Your advice.

09:07.255 --> 09:11.043
Took you long enough.

09:11.176 --> 09:16.762
I'm sorry, but I have to
go. The evacuation order.

09:16.848 --> 09:21.012
I'm a us citizen. See the eagle?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.137
Why is this...

09:27.108 --> 09:28.564
Come on...

09:29.152 --> 09:30.642
May 1?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.158
You're strong. Impressive.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.236
Well, have a good day.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.619
I read the thesis you
published 3 years ago.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.456
And haven't I warned you ever since?

09:49.589 --> 09:53.832
Yet all I got was a laugh and
the nickname "professor hot air".

09:53.927 --> 09:55.258
And now you want my advice.

09:55.345 --> 09:59.304
The Dean of this university is being
tried on embezzlement charges.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.119
I can issue an order prohibiting your
departure because you are a key witness.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.601
Are you trying to blackmail me?

10:06.147 --> 10:10.140
Yes, I am, and I'll do more if necessary.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.028
I just need 3 hours of your time. Please.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.195
There are 4 magma chambers under baekdu.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.621
The remaining 3 chambers
will explode consecutively,

10:25.708 --> 10:29.417
following the first, which
has already exploded.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.504
How much time do we have?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.957
This is an estimated
timeline for the eruptions.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.511
The scale of the second and third
explosions may be relatively weak.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.882
The real problem is the last eruption.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.052
Successive eruptions are certain,

10:47.147 --> 10:51.390
but the last will trigger an 8.0
earthquake on the Richter scale,

10:51.484 --> 10:55.898
exerting damage over 48%
of the Korean peninsula.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.155
Professor kang from Princeton university.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.614
Oh, damn.

11:11.713 --> 11:17.674
So, this stems from my simulation of
various rock layers over the last 3 years.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.545
In the case of a 600-kiloton
artificial explosion

11:21.639 --> 11:23.595
within a 5km radius of the chamber,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.344
it's estimated the pressure of the chamber

11:25.351 --> 11:28.889
could be reduced by 45%
with a 3.48% probability.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.471
What does that mean?

11:33.109 --> 11:35.065
Let me...

11:36.988 --> 11:38.819
Can I... thanks...

11:39.240 --> 11:42.027
To put it simply,

11:44.454 --> 11:47.992
such strong explosion can lower
the pressure of the chamber.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.038
You collapse the ground around the chamber

11:50.126 --> 11:53.289
and make a passage for the
pressure to decompress.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.167
It requires an extremely precise
calculation of distance and density,

11:57.300 --> 12:00.337
which is what I've been
working on for the past 3 years.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.672
Of course, it's currently only a theory.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.429
It's not like I can just
dig a tunnel or something.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.288
First deputy director of the
intelligence service will debrief.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.648
There is a total of 12 mines around baekdu.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.129
These underground mines are so complex

12:17.153 --> 12:20.236
even the workers often get lost.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.319
They don't match the ideal conditions
of professor kang's research,

12:23.409 --> 12:26.822
but we should consider if any of
these mines are worth examining.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.246
Mine 9 has a pit estimated at 3.5km deep.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.375
It's a copper mine?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.459
That's correct.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.497
Interesting. See, the
density of copper is...

12:35.588 --> 12:39.297
Did you say an induced explosion
of 600 kilotons? That scale of...

12:39.384 --> 12:43.377
Yeah. You need nuclear fission.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.466
Did you just say 'nuclear'?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.078
Are you suggesting executing a nuclear
explosion at the Korea-China border?

12:49.102 --> 12:53.061
- How can you say such a thing?
- It's throwing gasoline on fire!

12:53.147 --> 12:55.012
Do you even hear yourself?

12:58.569 --> 13:01.026
We've lost all contact with North Korea.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.897
We've got no partner to work on this with.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.575
All we can do is wait for the
disaster to hit then react.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.698
What would you do if you
were me, professor?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.376
Would you play the odds
on a wild plan like yours?

13:17.505 --> 13:20.463
Sir, if I were you, I'd do nothing.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.087
Rather than missing the target point

13:23.177 --> 13:25.168
and disturbing the magma chamber,

13:25.263 --> 13:27.754
it would be wiser to wait
and brace for impact

13:28.474 --> 13:30.055
and face a disaster.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.431
My plan has a 3.48% success probability.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.641
It's practically impossible.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.016
3.48%...

13:42.322 --> 13:44.233
I've heard that number before.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.857
That's what my poll was

13:48.453 --> 13:50.489
when I first announced
I was running for president.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.365
But I thought

13:51.456 --> 13:54.869
1% is already in the realm of possibility.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.625
I got 42.7% of the vote in the end.

14:01.424 --> 14:06.214
Professor kang, work on
getting that success percent up.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.052
Well... um... sir...

14:08.139 --> 14:10.380
It's not exactly something you just get up.

14:10.475 --> 14:15.686
Even if you calculated a
precise target point,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.791
you'd still need a nuclear
explosion of 600 kilotons.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.897
And where could we acquire that?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.560
If we had no other choice,
we could steal it.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.424
The USS Watson is scheduled to arrive

14:25.448 --> 14:26.858
at 4pm on the 16th.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.762
We need to get our hands on those warheads

14:29.786 --> 14:31.492
before the us does.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.411
Mobilize an nsc.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.410
Yes, sir.

14:41.381 --> 14:46.171
3 years in Afghanistan, foal eagle
and key resolve exercises,

14:46.302 --> 14:50.011
12 cycles completed in total... impressive.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.305
We're giving you a mission.
Report to base immediately.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.509
Sorry? I'm awaiting discharge.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.934
Shut up.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.857
You completed a key resolve course
on disarming icbms, correct?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.025
Only in training, sir.

15:05.113 --> 15:08.731
I've never actually seen an icbm.
For that, I'd have to go to...

15:11.327 --> 15:12.612
North Korea?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.118
Captain Cho...

15:15.957 --> 15:19.290
I can put your family on the
us citizen evacuation list.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.334
You know all the railways
and highways are destroyed.

15:22.422 --> 15:27.086
Where will you go with
a pregnant wife? How?

15:34.517 --> 15:36.849
Cutie cute, it's Thursday at 3.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.581
You'll go to the meeting point then
we'll go to incheon port together.

15:39.605 --> 15:44.224
You can't be late for that.
I'll quickly finish the job

15:44.444 --> 15:45.684
then join you.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.900
Are you worried about something?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.778
- Should I be?
- Of course not.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.242
Well, I'm not because you'll
make sure I don't have to be.

15:58.499 --> 16:02.458
You said it's a quick job
and not a dangerous one.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.952
So everything's fine.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.919
Yeah, right.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.456
But...

16:09.802 --> 16:13.294
I have to know something before I go.

16:14.849 --> 16:17.556
Hello? Anybody in there?

16:18.561 --> 16:22.520
I'm dying to know if it's
a boy or girl. Just in case.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.476
In case what?

16:24.609 --> 16:25.940
Just in case what?

16:28.279 --> 16:30.691
Nothing. I mean, you can
tell me after I get back.

16:33.868 --> 16:34.868
In-Chang.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.775
What?

16:35.870 --> 16:36.905
In-Chang!

16:38.164 --> 16:42.032
It makes me nervous when
you call me by my name.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.117
Can't you call me babe or something?

16:44.879 --> 16:46.106
I need you to make me a promise.

16:46.130 --> 16:46.664
Okay.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.413
If you keep it, I'll forgive you
for the promises you didn't keep.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.509
Okay.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.667
- Don't be late.
- Okay.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.753
Be there in time to meet
our baby in person.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.847
Okay.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.797
- Say I promise.
- I promise.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.809
I will be there.

17:07.527 --> 17:12.988
Tens of thousands of refugees are
traveling the broken road on foot.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.148
"Osan air base"

17:17.703 --> 17:21.366
these 6 icbms were the last
negotiation cards for North Korea

17:21.457 --> 17:23.071
and have been kept under the radar.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.625
As you can see, they're kept in
a place undetectable by satellites.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.670
So in order to get a more exact location,

17:29.757 --> 17:33.966
we turned a north informant to our
side before denuclearization began.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.676
Ri jun-pyong,

17:36.764 --> 17:40.006
a secretary at the north
Korean embassy in Beijing.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.758
That's his title by cover.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.969
He is actually a specially
trained operative

17:45.064 --> 17:47.305
under the ministry of
people's armed forces.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.313
Ri managed to locate the warheads,
but his cover was blown.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.237
Now, he's being held in
a detention facility.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.987
A GPS tracker was planted
on ri in case this happened.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.617
The goal of this operation is to
contact ri and secure the warheads.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.080
Gentlemen...

18:07.628 --> 18:09.744
Set your watches to countdown.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.463
This is the time remaining
until the final eruption.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.879
This operation is, in
principle, non-lethal,

18:20.016 --> 18:23.258
but we are violating the non-aggression
pact by crossing the demarcation line

18:23.352 --> 18:25.434
without being invited.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.557
Do you understand?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.387
Yes, sir.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.315
I have a question, sir.
What's the status of the mine?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.142
Is it possible to infiltrate?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.776
The technical team won't enter the mine.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.565
Hey...

18:39.577 --> 18:40.692
You'll only install the uranium

18:40.703 --> 18:41.988
- in the detonator.
- What?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.912
I'm counting on you to do your duty.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.540
This is the detonator.

18:51.839 --> 18:55.068
It's an empty shell now, but once uranium
is installed, it's a whole different thing.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.925
This is the most lightweight
form of a nuclear weapon.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.842
It's only a prototype, so the timer
cannot be stopped once started.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.717
The principals will handle the detonation,
so you technicals don't need to worry.

19:05.895 --> 19:10.059
Let's move on to separating the uranium
and attaching it to the detonator.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.810
Everyone get a protective suit.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.607
Protective suits!

19:28.918 --> 19:31.034
Wow, look at them.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.106
We're both special ops, but
they've got a different aura.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.666
Can you at least keep in step?

19:34.757 --> 19:35.997
Yes, sir!

19:36.425 --> 19:37.710
Sorry.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.019
"Command headquarters"

19:54.151 --> 19:55.231
any problems?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.650
No, sir. All clear.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.536
Alpha one moving to runway.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.489
Delta one moving to runway.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.074
Approve take off.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.037
Alpha one, take off approved. Climb.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.874
Current speed 209, altitude 1,000.

20:26.142 --> 20:29.384
We just crossed the demarcation line.
2200 hours, concentration 2,564.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.968
Levels are higher than anticipated.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.392
The silicone in the volcanic ash
might stop the engine.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.889
Increase altitude.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.020
Yes, sir. Increase altitude.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.536
These rubber bullets cramp my style.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.200
- Tae-sik?
- Yes.

20:54.295 --> 20:58.584
Our job is to fly 300km, dismantle
some missiles, then come back.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.630
Shooting guns and zapping tasers

21:00.718 --> 21:04.176
are for the guys in the other plane.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.094
Don't remind me.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.048
Alpha one - what was that?

21:09.143 --> 21:11.805
One of your engines has quit! Initiate apu!

21:15.900 --> 21:16.935
What the...

21:17.026 --> 21:17.936
Out of the way!

21:18.027 --> 21:19.358
Is that smoke?

21:19.445 --> 21:20.309
Move over.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.439
Get away from me.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.645
What's going on, man?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.860
It's dropping altitude fast.
The remaining engines can't hold.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.863
It can't withstand the weight.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.319
They have to jump now.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.202
2800, 2500, 2100...

21:34.210 --> 21:35.700
Dropping fast!

21:36.420 --> 21:37.284
Prepare to jump.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.585
Get your parachute!

21:38.672 --> 21:42.790
- You mean now?
- What the hell is happening?

21:42.927 --> 21:45.043
Are we even in North Korea?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.877
You guys need to calm down.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.598
My chute! Where's my chute?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.365
You're wearing it! Get your shit together!

21:53.729 --> 21:55.685
Everyone, put your masks on! Go!

22:07.368 --> 22:08.904
What are you doing? Jump!

22:09.370 --> 22:10.610
Go! Jump! Now!

22:24.134 --> 22:27.752
Come in, Alpha one! Alpha one, come in!

22:29.557 --> 22:31.343
It's gone silent, sir.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.923
What about the tech team?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.508
They completed the jump.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.099
Who's the commander there?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.078
You okay, man?

22:58.794 --> 23:00.313
- Captain, you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everyone else?

23:00.337 --> 23:01.827
Captain, it's command.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.254
Captain Cho in-Chang.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.457
Do you have Alpha one's crash point?

23:06.594 --> 23:09.836
I'm not... I'm not sure but...

23:09.930 --> 23:11.386
Yes, I see it!

23:11.515 --> 23:12.925
Locate and retrieve the black bag.

23:13.017 --> 23:13.722
Come back!

23:13.809 --> 23:14.423
Hey, you idiot!

23:14.518 --> 23:15.257
My name's captain Cho, sir!

23:15.352 --> 23:17.684
Then listen up, captain!
Go get the black bag!

23:17.771 --> 23:20.228
There's a map of the mines
and a GPS tracker in it.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.432
Secure the bag no matter what. Understood?

23:22.776 --> 23:24.562
Sir, yes, sir.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.985
What's going on, man?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.856
We're colossally fucked...

23:35.623 --> 23:36.829
Shit...

23:42.212 --> 23:45.830
I think I found it. You get the firearms.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.925
Okay.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.140
Dammitt! Dammitt!

23:56.226 --> 23:57.557
We have to go now!

23:57.645 --> 24:00.352
I mean it! Let's go!

24:02.441 --> 24:05.433
- Come on.
- Okay, okay! I got it!

24:06.153 --> 24:07.734
Hurry!

24:19.416 --> 24:22.078
Captain, did you get the bag?

24:22.211 --> 24:23.792
Yes, sir. Bag retrieved.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.797
Good job. Any survivors on the Alpha team?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.131
No survivors, sir.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.433
Follow the GPS tracker
to the detention center.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.012
Locate and secure ri jun-pyong.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.143
Requesting backup, sir.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.020
We'll stand by until they arrive.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.476
There is no backup.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.149
All air routes have been
blocked due to ash.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.816
Land entry is impossible.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.611
You're the only team that can
carry out this mission now.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.915
Captain Cho, as of right now,
you are in charge of this operation.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.586
Upon securing the nuclear weapons,
move to the final explosion point.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.790
Is this for real?

25:11.885 --> 25:14.001
Are we actually in North Korea?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.679
We can do this... we can do this...

25:18.434 --> 25:21.801
It's not so bad if you think about it, no?

25:21.895 --> 25:22.895
No...

25:23.188 --> 25:26.396
We were going to dismantle
the missile anyway.

25:26.483 --> 25:30.522
Now, we're just going a little
further, entering a mine,

25:30.612 --> 25:32.898
and setting off a detonator. That's all.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.592
You understand what that means,
right? We can do this, right?

25:34.616 --> 25:38.700
Our job is to diffuse bombs,
not detonate them...

25:38.787 --> 25:40.493
Especially nuclear ones...

25:40.581 --> 25:43.664
Be it nuclear or not, we just
have to set off a timer.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.662
It's not like it's a suicide mission.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.714
Shit!

25:50.382 --> 25:51.382
What is it?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.458
It... slipped.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.884
You crazy bastard! What
the hell are you doing?!

25:55.971 --> 25:58.257
Rubber bullets can be
lethal at close range!

25:58.348 --> 25:59.758
What are you, a damn boy scout?

25:59.850 --> 26:02.717
- Sorry...
- Get your act together! All of you!

26:03.520 --> 26:05.135
Put your helmets on.

26:07.441 --> 26:10.478
How long has it been since you shot a gun?

26:11.361 --> 26:14.068
Shooting...

26:14.281 --> 26:16.067
I think... about a year.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.653
Did you expect to just walk in there?

26:19.787 --> 26:24.531
Looks like we can just walk in there.
All those people are fleeing.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.914
It's a riot. All security
seems to have been killed.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.458
G-g-good... it's going as planned.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.713
But something's not right.
Ri isn't showing any movement.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.044
Let me see it.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.724
Ri survived execution by
leaking intel about us.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.181
It's possible he is currently a double spy.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.764
Consider him extremely dangerous
and don't let your guard down.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.863
Ri jun-pyong!

27:00.244 --> 27:01.950
I ain't over there.

27:16.802 --> 27:21.466
Really? Y'all are just a bunch of kids.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.471
Very simple.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.929
Ri has a Southern accent?

27:26.228 --> 27:28.219
Doesn't look like the guy in our picture.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.934
Are you jun-pyong ri?

27:31.024 --> 27:33.231
You judge people by the way they talk?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.563
I say don't judge a person by his words

27:35.696 --> 27:37.482
but by his actions.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.280
If I spoke Russian, would
that make me Russian?

27:40.617 --> 27:43.609
Don't rely on what I say. Just trust
that beeping device you got there.

27:46.373 --> 27:49.456
Ri jun-pyong, first secretary
under mpaf in Beijing...

27:49.751 --> 27:53.164
Our agency has all of your information.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.538
An agent whose code name is...

27:55.299 --> 27:56.414
Whose code name...

27:57.843 --> 28:00.425
The great wall'. You know him, right?

28:00.554 --> 28:04.797
So you better not try anything.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.853
What're you standing round for then?

28:13.275 --> 28:14.355
Open this thing up.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.856
We decide whether we open the door
or not. Sergeant min, open the door.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.732
Officer Kim, open the door.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.313
That's right. Kim, open the door.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.153
Come on, Kim. Hop to it.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.610
Just a moment.

28:31.126 --> 28:35.290
Mr. ri, there's going to be a
small explosion. Please step back.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.457
Officer Kim.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.833
Fire in the hole!

28:39.009 --> 28:40.795
Did you check the batteries?

28:40.969 --> 28:41.969
I did.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.089
Try again.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.428
Fire in the hole!

28:44.765 --> 28:45.629
Why doesn't it work?

28:45.724 --> 28:46.884
Give it to me.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.812
Are you okay?

28:59.279 --> 29:01.941
Wow, the air sure is different out here.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.615
I need a shower.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.068
Shower?

29:14.211 --> 29:16.702
So you wanna find some warheads,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.922
set them off in a mine in yongsuri,

29:20.133 --> 29:20.792
yes.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.670
And try to stop a volcanic eruption?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.297
Exactly.

29:27.224 --> 29:31.763
You gotta be kidding me. You think
you're some kinda... what's it called...

29:32.062 --> 29:33.427
"Science ninja team gatchaman"?

29:33.522 --> 29:37.140
What's that make you, the owl?

29:38.568 --> 29:40.559
How dare you call him an owl?

29:40.696 --> 29:44.405
This is why capitalism is doomed.
It allows too much imagination.

29:44.658 --> 29:48.776
You only have to take us to the warheads.

29:48.954 --> 29:53.038
We'll release you upon
reaching the location.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.912
You'll release me?

30:00.173 --> 30:02.585
Take a seat. Please.

30:02.718 --> 30:03.753
Let's talk this out.

30:03.844 --> 30:11.137
The great wall' must have
told you crazy things about me.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.308
- Ri!
- Freeze!

30:13.395 --> 30:16.728
Mr. ri, if you want, we can help you
become a south Korean citizen.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.103
If you do, the Korean government is sure
to give you an apartment in gangnam.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.808
What do gangnam properties cost now?

30:27.743 --> 30:29.779
It ain't gonna shoot if the safety's on.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.792
So... can I shower or what?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.913
Lower your guns, lower them!

30:43.008 --> 30:44.373
Lower the guns.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.170
Now...

30:46.887 --> 30:48.673
- Lieutenant han.
- Sir.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.504
We switch to plan b.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.807
If we take route 8, we get
10 minutes extra, right?

30:54.019 --> 30:56.726
- Excuse me?
- Let's do this by the books.

30:57.731 --> 30:58.937
Mr. ri,

30:59.024 --> 31:00.355
I'll give you 10 minutes,

31:00.442 --> 31:04.026
but if you behave like that again,
we can't guarantee your safety.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.363
Go on.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.779
What kinda safety is there in hell?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.866
Outta the way, owl.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.536
Bastard...

31:16.917 --> 31:18.532
Everyone, gather around.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.876
You handled that well.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.539
Owl and tae-sik, keep your eyes on him.

31:25.634 --> 31:29.126
- Owl...
- I'll confer with headquarters.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.761
This is good. Everything's
going as planned.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.429
What plan is he talking about?

32:46.882 --> 32:50.374
"Near the city of hamheung"

32:50.594 --> 32:54.178
I ain't used soap in a while. Feels so dry.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.171
Anybody got lotion?

32:56.808 --> 32:59.424
We're headed to hamheung, right?

32:59.436 --> 33:00.926
That's where the icbms are kept?

33:01.021 --> 33:02.477
Would you look at that?

33:02.564 --> 33:04.020
Whatta sight...

33:06.485 --> 33:09.192
The great leader finally on his back.

33:09.279 --> 33:13.864
I always felt bad looking down
on him from my apartment.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.326
Thanks.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.545
What're those?

33:27.297 --> 33:28.662
Gimme one.

33:40.644 --> 33:41.884
Man, it's sour!

33:44.898 --> 33:46.229
Oh, sour and sweet.

33:46.691 --> 33:51.435
I ain't had something like this
in so long it makes my jaw hurt.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.320
Hey.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.533
Yeah?

34:02.791 --> 34:04.031
Wait a minute...

34:04.751 --> 34:06.207
- What is it?
- Where's my wallet?

34:06.294 --> 34:09.001
- Your wallet?
- Check under the seats.

34:09.089 --> 34:12.331
What, lose your kid or something?

34:16.388 --> 34:19.050
You can't let them outta your sight.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.674
That's why parents need eyes
in the back of their heads.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.264
Where's the map?

34:30.360 --> 34:31.725
Was it important?

34:31.820 --> 34:33.105
Because I ate it.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.357
What?

34:36.199 --> 34:39.440
Don't worry. I got it saved up here.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.409
I reckon everybody needs insurance.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.868
You crazy son of a bitch!

34:45.958 --> 34:47.790
Hey, hey!

34:50.547 --> 34:52.003
You gotta hell of a punch.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.295
Shut your hole!

34:53.382 --> 34:54.463
Tae-sik, enough.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.713
You better hope these cuffs stay on

34:57.971 --> 34:59.962
because you're dead if they don't.

35:03.518 --> 35:08.763
If we go through hamheung like
ri suggests, we'll save an hour.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.647
Are you trying to advertise
you're there to steal a nuke?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.191
I'm sorry, sir.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.526
Take a detour.

35:15.614 --> 35:20.074
You must get to the site before
the next eruption, got it?

35:20.160 --> 35:21.491
Yes, sir.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.903
He didn't have to shout...

35:25.290 --> 35:27.997
Be quick and no funny business.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.783
Like what?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.917
I swear, this guy...

35:34.758 --> 35:38.421
I can't believe this...

35:46.227 --> 35:47.763
Jeez.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.097
Gotta light?

35:55.528 --> 35:56.528
You gotta light?

35:56.655 --> 35:57.861
What're you saying?

35:57.947 --> 35:59.653
I asked for a light, shithead.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.908
Here.

36:04.996 --> 36:05.996
Oh, shit!

36:07.248 --> 36:08.704
What an asshole.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.009
Damn, I'm tired.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.631
Let's get going!

36:22.722 --> 36:23.632
Yes, sir.

36:23.723 --> 36:27.136
I want to apologize on
behalf of Mr. park earlier.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.467
Never mind.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.602
I'd rather he say shit to my
face than behind my back.

36:32.273 --> 36:36.186
I knew the Republic would fall

36:36.695 --> 36:38.231
but sure didn't expect this.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.061
For a traitor, you're sentimental.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.566
Didn't you hear?

36:41.658 --> 36:46.243
It takes sentiment to betray.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.196
Will you pinch it off already?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.615
Sure.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.000
Seriously...

37:05.306 --> 37:07.922
Did your dumb-ass forget?

37:09.310 --> 37:11.767
I told you about these cuffs.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.731
What's taking so long?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.403
Wait. You sent tae-sik alone?

37:25.869 --> 37:27.734
He's not back yet?

37:27.871 --> 37:29.111
No, sir.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.241
Where is he at?

37:34.335 --> 37:35.074
Right here.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.003
What about ri? The GPS!

37:38.131 --> 37:39.496
He's stationary.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.376
Shit!

37:42.677 --> 37:44.508
Tae-sik! Tae-sik!

37:44.596 --> 37:45.756
Tae-sik!

37:45.847 --> 37:48.304
Hey! Open your eyes!

37:49.434 --> 37:50.264
Where's ri?

37:50.351 --> 37:51.887
Where did he go?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.850
The GPS...

37:59.778 --> 38:04.647
"Hamheung"

38:15.627 --> 38:16.662
Wait.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.134
Move.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.067
Where the hell is he at?

38:57.460 --> 38:59.621
How are we going to find him?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.786
Been a long time.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.205
Ri jun-pyong?

39:03.299 --> 39:05.631
I had myself some surprise visitors.

39:06.135 --> 39:09.218
You're gonna laugh when I tell you who.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.428
The area is too big. We need to split up.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.135
What if ri passed through here?

39:17.313 --> 39:21.602
No, he wanted to come here.
He must have a reason.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.558
We'll never find him.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.770
Hold on...

39:33.288 --> 39:34.903
Where are you going?

39:48.094 --> 39:50.710
The great leader finally on his back.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.219
I always felt bad looking down
on him from my apartment.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.817
I didn't think I'd see you
again till I was dead.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.027
Where's sun-ok?

40:56.079 --> 40:57.364
Bocheon.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.696
At my brother's.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.031
Bocheon?

41:01.125 --> 41:04.868
That's right in front of baekdu.
How could you send a little girl to...

41:05.254 --> 41:09.213
How cute. You're trying to be a father.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.178
I'm gonna ask you this one last time.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.640
Did you

41:22.230 --> 41:23.561
rat me out?

41:29.153 --> 41:30.359
Yes, I did.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.408
He's close.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.940
10 o'clock, upper level. Let's go.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.362
Yes, sir.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.918
Why?

41:53.302 --> 41:56.339
Where were you gonna go after
abandoning your own daughter?

41:57.557 --> 41:58.888
Did you forget?

42:00.935 --> 42:02.971
You abandoned us first.

42:04.647 --> 42:05.647
Ri jun-pyong.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.530
Put the gun down.

42:13.614 --> 42:14.649
Shoot me.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.818
I don't have long left anyway.

42:19.162 --> 42:20.402
Put the gun down now!

42:23.791 --> 42:25.201
See you in hell.

42:41.142 --> 42:41.927
Nam, the cuffs.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.133
Yes, sir.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.561
Did I scare you good?

42:49.484 --> 42:51.145
I'm done with your bullshit.

42:51.277 --> 42:54.064
Ooh, a tough guy.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.363
Come on then. There ain't much time.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.319
Let's go.

43:10.880 --> 43:16.250
Us citizens in Korea are
gathering at local meeting points.

43:16.636 --> 43:20.595
Included in the evacuation list are
Korea-based us military and their families,

43:20.598 --> 43:22.558
us citizens, and Koreans
who obtained us approval.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.318
Don't worry, sweetie.

43:37.156 --> 43:40.774
Mommy can do this. Mommy
can do this for us.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.657
Let's go see daddy.

43:46.124 --> 43:50.914
"27th machinery complex
kanggye, chagang province"

43:55.299 --> 43:58.541
all security has left save a skeleton crew.

44:00.680 --> 44:04.514
After tae-sik clears with sniping,
get in position and cover the team.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.058
The rest of us will enter...

44:08.187 --> 44:09.518
What's the plan?

44:11.023 --> 44:12.433
I'm telling them now.

44:12.525 --> 44:13.731
So you're making shit up?

44:13.818 --> 44:15.024
For crying out loud...

44:15.611 --> 44:18.398
Cover the enemy's eyes first.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.313
That closed factory is a cover.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.235
The actual facility is underneath.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.971
But what happens if you kill the generator?

44:23.995 --> 44:25.405
Y'all got night vision goggles?

44:25.830 --> 44:30.073
It takes 2 minutes for the
emergency generator to start.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.040
- So you best move fast.
- Yes, sir!

44:37.633 --> 44:40.420
I'll say this only once.
I'm in charge here.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.843
Then make the call.

44:46.851 --> 44:48.216
Gather around, everyone.

44:51.230 --> 44:54.063
Actually, his plan is
pretty similar to mine.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.686
First of all, tae-sik...

44:55.776 --> 44:58.984
You'll find the generator and shut it down.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.108
The rest of you will enter
through the main gate.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
Yes, sir!

45:03.284 --> 45:05.570
Sir, you told me to handle sniping.

45:06.746 --> 45:09.237
You can't do that after you
shut down the generator?

45:09.332 --> 45:14.042
Is sniping even necessary
in this situation?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.914
Sniping would be good to have.

45:16.005 --> 45:17.040
Yeah?

45:17.340 --> 45:19.706
That's some rare leadership.

45:35.524 --> 45:37.810
Unit 2 is inside basement 1.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.738
Tae-sik, the generator! Now!

45:49.705 --> 45:51.320
Nope, that's not it...

45:52.667 --> 45:53.531
Return fire!

45:53.626 --> 45:54.626
Return fire!

45:55.461 --> 45:57.326
Have we located the hostiles?

45:57.421 --> 45:59.787
At your 11 o'clock but
their numbers are unknown!

46:00.508 --> 46:02.419
We're engaging!

46:04.095 --> 46:05.301
Why aren't the lights off yet?

46:05.388 --> 46:06.423
Tae-sik! Tae-sik!

46:06.514 --> 46:09.301
Shut down the goddamn generator!

46:10.142 --> 46:10.847
Dammit...

46:10.935 --> 46:12.175
The circuit breaker!

46:20.736 --> 46:22.852
Captain, basement 2 electricity is down!

46:22.947 --> 46:24.938
Why's it still on here?

46:35.835 --> 46:37.917
Unit 2 has cleared basement 2!
Hostiles contained!

46:38.004 --> 46:38.663
I'm on m y way!

46:38.754 --> 46:39.754
Give me a gun!

46:39.797 --> 46:42.914
What? I can't give you a gun!

46:43.009 --> 46:44.374
You want us both to die here?

46:52.476 --> 46:53.807
Oh, damn it.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.602
You take that side.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.127
What's the kill range for rubber bullets?

47:00.151 --> 47:01.516
How would I...

47:07.325 --> 47:08.656
Comrades!

47:09.285 --> 47:13.745
I'm major ri jun-pyong of mpaf!

47:14.415 --> 47:18.203
I just killed a commander of
the south Korean puppet army!

47:18.461 --> 47:20.622
Come and look!

47:40.691 --> 47:42.773
That went better than I expected.

47:45.029 --> 47:48.362
How can you just shoot me without
warning? What kind of plan is that?

47:48.783 --> 47:50.193
Scared the shit out of me...

48:07.176 --> 48:08.416
Come on in.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.338
No more messing around.

48:14.767 --> 48:15.927
What's the date?

48:16.018 --> 48:17.053
Is that the password?

48:17.436 --> 48:20.143
How could that be password?
I just wanna know.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.770
I got no idea how long I
was in that shit hole.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.457
Hold on.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.167
Gotcha again.

49:05.025 --> 49:05.935
Grab the gear.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.026
Yes, sir.

49:09.697 --> 49:10.697
Let's do this.

49:21.041 --> 49:26.752
Comrades, let me introduce you
to the treasures of the Republic.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.819
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.493
So sleek and beautiful.

50:00.080 --> 50:04.073
But you southies still call them
the mistake of the Republic.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.163
A big one, too.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.540
What's the radioactive reading?

50:09.465 --> 50:11.205
0.128 sievert.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.542
Good, thank you. Let's get to work.

50:16.514 --> 50:17.845
What are y'all doing?

50:18.807 --> 50:22.516
Did you forget about my insurance?

50:22.853 --> 50:25.595
Just stay put for a minute.

50:29.902 --> 50:30.687
Bring it over here.

50:30.778 --> 50:31.813
Perfect fit.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.106
Hang in there.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.312
You promised to release me!

50:35.783 --> 50:37.148
Sneaky sonsabitches!

50:40.913 --> 50:42.403
Begin disassembly.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.659
Extracting warhead from propellant.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.247
Separating uranium casing.

51:01.350 --> 51:02.590
Radioactive reading?

51:02.685 --> 51:06.143
8.6, 8.8... and rising.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.321
Separating the core.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.693
Mounting on 1 and 2, complete.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.161
Mounting on 4, complete.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.600
It's the second eruption! We need to hurry!

52:21.180 --> 52:24.547
Ensure safety then
everyone back to position!

52:24.683 --> 52:25.723
It's sooner than expected!

52:29.980 --> 52:32.562
"Disaster warning: Paldang
dam has collapsed."

52:37.112 --> 52:38.352
Oh my!

53:06.308 --> 53:07.923
Hey! The doors are closing!

53:08.018 --> 53:09.098
Look here!

53:13.357 --> 53:14.357
What's wrong?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.560
This bolt is stuck.

53:15.859 --> 53:18.271
Then force it.

53:20.572 --> 53:21.572
Look!

53:42.886 --> 53:44.126
We have to skip this one!

53:44.221 --> 53:45.301
Yes, let's skip this.

53:45.806 --> 53:47.717
Don't we need all of them?

53:47.850 --> 53:49.681
The plan only works with all 6 nukes!

54:02.740 --> 54:04.696
Assholes!

54:20.466 --> 54:21.651
Are you crazy? We could all die!

54:21.675 --> 54:23.131
It's all we got!

54:29.808 --> 54:30.422
Hello.

54:30.434 --> 54:32.345
We obtained a go ahead from above.

54:32.436 --> 54:35.428
I'll let you cross with your daughter.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.142
Bring the detonator and a technician
who can disassemble it.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.727
Hello? Hello?

54:49.620 --> 54:50.735
Thank god.

54:52.998 --> 54:54.078
Finish it up.

54:54.166 --> 54:55.326
- Yes, captain.
- Hurry.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.503
Where is ri?

55:01.632 --> 55:03.839
We can't wait any longer!

55:12.976 --> 55:14.261
Ri, that bastard!

55:14.353 --> 55:15.388
You cuffed him properly?

55:15.479 --> 55:16.184
Yes!

55:16.271 --> 55:18.478
- You should've double checked!
- I did!

55:25.781 --> 55:26.941
Did I scare you?

55:27.074 --> 55:28.405
What the hell, man?

55:28.492 --> 55:30.528
Funny how fate works.

55:30.619 --> 55:35.329
- Get the gear! Quick!
- If I'd left, you would've been trapped.

55:35.415 --> 55:38.407
- But I jammed a barrel between the doors so...
- Load up and go!

56:23.088 --> 56:24.373
Everyone okay?

56:24.756 --> 56:25.836
Yes, sir!

56:27.050 --> 56:28.290
I'm fine too.

56:29.595 --> 56:30.675
The detonator?

56:30.762 --> 56:31.922
It's fine.

56:35.100 --> 56:35.885
Let's go.

56:35.976 --> 56:39.184
Perfectly fine... you heartless asshole.

56:41.773 --> 56:42.773
It's delta one!

56:42.858 --> 56:44.894
- Connect him.
- Yes, sir!

56:45.235 --> 56:48.227
Captain Cho, how did it go?

56:48.322 --> 56:49.528
We secured them.

56:49.781 --> 56:51.988
We got all 6 installed
in the detonator, sir.

56:57.789 --> 56:58.789
Well done.

56:58.874 --> 57:01.411
But the second eruption
happened during the operation.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.332
Is everything okay on that side?

57:04.254 --> 57:05.414
My wife, ji-young...

57:05.505 --> 57:08.087
The eruption occurred sooner than expected.

57:08.467 --> 57:12.210
We'll update the new estimated time
for the last eruption. You must hurry.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.590
Where...

57:21.563 --> 57:23.224
Are you comfortable down there?

57:23.315 --> 57:25.397
We got it all wrong.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.816
80% of the deposit in mine 7 is iron ore.

57:31.907 --> 57:34.649
It's an iron fortress that
can contain anything.

57:34.826 --> 57:35.565
Your point?

57:35.661 --> 57:37.071
The speed... ouch!

57:41.750 --> 57:46.084
The velocity of the eruption was faster
than estimated. The temperature soared.

57:46.171 --> 57:49.709
At this rate, the third eruption will tip
the temperature over the fusing point.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.506
That iron fortress is softening.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.375
See?

57:54.805 --> 57:56.386
The volcano's changing.

57:56.765 --> 57:58.301
That's her weak point.

57:58.392 --> 58:00.508
If we can hit that point,

58:05.232 --> 58:06.096
53%!

58:06.191 --> 58:08.147
With the 7th mine,

58:09.152 --> 58:11.359
we can stop the final explosion.

58:19.162 --> 58:23.155
Who would've guessed my timely
judgment would save our lives?

58:23.375 --> 58:25.240
Will you please get up?

58:25.419 --> 58:26.625
This thing's very dangerous.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.710
Careful.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.454
Ri.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.175
We go our own ways now. Give me the map.

58:36.972 --> 58:39.213
I ain't ready to cancel my insurance yet.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.222
I told you enough with the bullshit.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.803
Give me the map now.

58:44.312 --> 58:45.927
Did you check your safety?

58:49.234 --> 58:50.474
I'll be damned.

58:51.194 --> 58:52.650
There is some man in you.

58:52.779 --> 58:56.112
Rubber bullets are fatal at this
range, so stop fucking around.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.615
Can you do this without the map?

59:06.251 --> 59:07.411
Take cover!

59:09.713 --> 59:11.920
You can thank me later!

59:12.007 --> 59:13.622
Don't hold your breath!

59:15.969 --> 59:19.712
Lieutenant han, did you load the detonator?

59:19.806 --> 59:21.171
Yes, sir!

59:21.558 --> 59:23.264
Good! Return fire!

59:23.351 --> 59:24.511
Yes, sir!

59:26.480 --> 59:27.686
Come on!

59:27.773 --> 59:28.933
Hurry! Careful!

59:29.983 --> 59:31.189
Dammitt!

59:31.651 --> 59:32.561
This is delta one!

59:32.652 --> 59:33.687
What's going on?

59:33.820 --> 59:35.185
We're taking fire!

59:35.447 --> 59:36.447
From north Koreans?

59:36.615 --> 59:37.821
Can't be sure.

59:39.326 --> 59:42.238
Permission to use live ammo.

59:44.748 --> 59:45.748
Granted.

59:48.085 --> 59:48.995
Tae-sik, secure visual!

59:49.086 --> 59:50.086
Yes, sir!

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:04.965
Take cover!

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.397
Come in, tae-sik!

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.188
Min!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.481
Tae-sik is down!

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:19.404
He's losing a lot of blood!

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.052
Secure retreat and get him out of there!

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.612
- Yes, sir.
- I'll go!

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.576
Direct hits.

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.417
They have heat detectors.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.796
Who are they?

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.381
I don't know, man.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.180
What the...

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.550
I'm going for the truck. Cover me.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:51.971
Don't tell me to cover you or... shit!

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.056
Crazy assholes!

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.293
Dammitt!

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.061
- You hurt?
- I'm okay.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.102
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:40.237
Min, get ready!

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.322
Yes, sir!

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:02.999
Retreat! Retreat!

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.584
Everyone, fall back!

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.295
Over here!

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.264
Get in! Quick!

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.731
Hurry!

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.605
Where's my team?

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.607
This is gonna hurt.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.245
Huh?

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.438
Ambassador...

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:25.333
Do you expect us to sit idly by
and watch this disaster happen?

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:43.768
I need you to calm down
and think of a way...

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.274
Forget it. I'm due to leave,

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.275
and I got nothing keeping me here.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.448
There's nothing keeping you here?

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.873
Well, I've got so much that

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:05.380
I was prepared to do anything,
even beg a us citizen, for help.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.957
I was clearly out of my mind.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:13.347
It all came to this because of an incompetent
government that can't decide its own fate,

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.515
and you're part of that! Okay?

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.220
The damn...

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.937
The doors are locked! Unlock the doors!

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.213
Tae-sik... come on...

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:05.019
Don't worry.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.977
The package is wrapped and en route.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.322
Bocheon, 8 o'clock.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.281
Why bocheon?

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.782
I got business there.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.705
Don't forget the package
is payable on delivery.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.631
You're awake?

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:31.957
You know why you ain't got eyes
in the back of your head?

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:33.922
What are you talking about?

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.594
So you don't look back.

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:42.181
Why did you put these on me?

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.853
Come on, uncuff me.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.521
What are you doing?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.893
Get these off me.

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.818
Ti... coo... ti...

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:51.439
What is cootie coot?

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.771
- What?
- You kept mumbling

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.738
that in your sleep.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:56.862
Having nightmares?

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.409
Cutie cute.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:05.124
Uncuff me, and I'll tell you what it means.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.451
You're such an idiot...

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.080
The border is lined with Chinese military

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.999
ready to charge in at
the first provocation.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:16.882
I have evidence and witness to
a violation of non-aggression.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.806
They're gonna be so happy to see you.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.343
We're going to bocheon

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:30.147
where I'll serve you up
on a silver plate. Got it?

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:31.768
You're out of your damn mind!

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:36.948
You can't do that now!
It'll be the end for everyone!

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.692
It's been the end for a long time.

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:43.029
No, I mean the final hour! There will
be 2 more eruptions in 17 hours!

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.866
If we don't stop them, it's over
for the north and the south!

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.450
So let me out of here!

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:53.131
I don't care about the south, and
it's long been over in the north.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:56.383
Oh, shit.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:58.132
They need to go to mine 7 instead.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:01.176
We need to regain access to
our comms with the team.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.307
What can we possibly do
after violating us alliance?

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.601
They broke our trust too.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.929
Chance of success was low anyway.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.560
It's 53% now.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.476
That's higher than your approval rating.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:17.188
I'm sorry.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:44.640
The shell...

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:57.646
Thank you, tae-sik.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.273
Hey, cookie cooties...

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:01.448
Yeah?

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:02.742
You watch damo?

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:03.829
What?

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:07.113
The south Korean TV show.
I missed the final episode.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:11.327
It was killing me while I was locked up.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.545
Oh! Damo! Of course!

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:19.259
What happens to chae-ok and Bo-yoon?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.505
Do you know?

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.090
I haven't seen that show.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:26.720
But maybe Jewel in the palace
is a better choice for you.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.974
Then again, my love from the star
was pretty popular.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.100
But I don't know because
I only watch am-shows.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.682
What's that?

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.609
It's short for American TV shows.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:41.488
Ah, American TV show, am-show...

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:42.861
Yep!

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.698
You southies contract everything.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:47.823
We call it "con-every".

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.957
Huh?

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.033
That's f-mad.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.087
Fucking mad. I contracted that.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.834
You're catching on!

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:05.304
Impressive, right? I impressed myself!

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.688
- Okay, okay...
- Very clever.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.548
It's not cool to sneak up like that.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:43.546
No, you're the sneaky one.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.845
I'm sorry but

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.928
don't try anything funny.
Just play this right because

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.469
of course, just a sec...

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.140
You know it?

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:59.400
The GPS. My team will come find me.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:01.394
Give it here.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.275
How can I when I'm tied up?

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:04.943
You piece of...

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:07.067
Who has insurance now?

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:10.115
I'll cut you open!

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.473
That hurts!

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:13.808
Look!

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.101
Out front!

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:24.519
Stop!

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:25.820
Stop!

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.779
- The brakes don't work!
- Stop the car!

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:56.009
Where do you think you're going?

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.728
My arm, my arm!

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:13.534
"Evacuation meeting point"

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:15.620
"16 hours to final eruption”

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.733
- You're going to incheon port, right?
- What's going on?

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:25.792
That's right.

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:33.213
You must be ji-young, captain Cho's wife.

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.307
Yes...

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.263
Find yourself a seat.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:20.722
Here.

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:30.648
Thank you.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.736
You're Korean?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.789
So... you are Korean.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.081
Mr. Robert,

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:56.096
when we get to the port,
will the ship leave right away?

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:01.225
I'm supposed to meet my husband.
He won't be late this time.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.684
Do you know when the ship leaves?

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:09.021
Oh, here. Thank you.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.112
Can I help you?

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.869
No, you can't. Look, look...

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.575
You speak very good english.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:53.940
Cutie cute...

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:15.878
Does it hurt?

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:20.095
Hurts me too, dumb-ass.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.260
You've totally lost it.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:31.099
I was scheduled to be discharged
today! I should be a civilian!

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:36.863
But I was dragged here to steal
a nuke and get shot at by Americans!

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:39.611
Along with the rest of my team!

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:41.909
Lieutenant min... tae-sik!

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.325
In fucking North Korea!

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.208
Man, please help me! I beg of you!

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:53.083
We have to get to baekdu! I need your help!

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:56.044
This is too much! Please!

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.458
Crazy ass southie...

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:58.963
What do I do?

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.598
Lift and pull. Put your back into it.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.347
Why are we even doing this?

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.728
Look what you got us into!

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:13.933
This is no treasure, it's a burden.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.770
What now?

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.578
We'll never make it on time.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.924
We need to move faster.
The explosions are coming.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.877
Is it your first kid?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.800
Yeah.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:49.595
When they're young is best.
Kids are beautiful then.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.808
After that is pure hell.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.312
Is that why you abandoned
your wife and child?

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.443
I left to save my family.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:01.318
You picked a name yet?

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.820
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.695
You didn't see? It's right
there in the picture.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:07.657
What?

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:10.990
Look, look. See it?

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.787
See what? In the picture?

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.881
I can see it from here.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.261
- The sex of the baby is...
- Yeah?

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.763
I'll tell you after you
tell me how damo ends.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:33.479
I feel sorry for a kid who
may not never see its father.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:36.773
Let's go.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.487
You're a real piece of work.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.826
Poor kid...

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.872
You're infringing on
United States' sovereignty.

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:52.911
"Incheon port"

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.084
step away from the fence.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.244
I repeat,

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:01.294
you're infringing on
United States' sovereignty.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:26.570
Go on. My husband will come soon.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:29.819
Your husband...

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:47.845
Shit.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.392
How can there be nothing?

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:05.154
Hey, ri! There's something here.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.948
Come look.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:09.285
Come on.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.031
- What is it?
- There's something here.

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:12.327
Get outta the way.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.538
There's something...

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.783
A little more.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:19.743
- No, not like that.
- Will you shut up?

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.578
That's right. Just a little more.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.255
Don't drag it.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:24.881
There, there.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:26.837
Yes, finally!

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.023
That feels so much better.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:53.447
Oh, shit!

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.410
This tastes just like coke.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:58.911
That's because it is coke.

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:02.957
Does so-coke have a different taste?

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:04.462
So-coke?

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.791
Socialist coke!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.969
Oh, come on. You're
supposed to be the expert.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.301
My wife, ji-young, loves coke,

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:22.603
but she hasn't had any
since she got pregnant.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:26.569
I promised I wouldn't be late this time.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.898
What the hell am I doing here?

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:35.073
Some people show up so late others
don't even know who they are.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.330
Your daughter's in bocheon, right?

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:48.294
It's okay if a child forgets a face.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.841
No, not that.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:55.298
I'm worried I won't recognize her.

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:03.688
Hey, cutie kaka.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.692
What does that mean?

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.733
It's a greeting

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:13.065
used between very close people.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.526
Never between you and me.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.411
Shut the hell up.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.494
I should've gutted you when I could.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:26.169
Get these cuffs off me.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.786
- Captain!
- Lieutenant min!

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.166
- Load it!
- Quickly!

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.468
Gimme a gun.

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.395
Crouch down.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:27.139
You okay?

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.228
It's an earthquake. Hold on tight.

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.378
Step on it!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:48.141
You're infringing on
united sates' sovereignty.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.351
Step away from the fence.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:08.744
Dammitt...

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.868
We're people too.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.874
Please save us!

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.590
You okay? We need to go.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:25.891
I have to meet my husband.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.764
He's not coming!

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:29.977
He's in North Korea.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.181
What? Where?

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.279
Min, stop!

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:22.401
No!

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.735
- Stop!
- Stop right now!

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.286
Lift! Come on!

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:53.932
Tae-sik, you okay, man?

01:25:54.274 --> 01:25:56.435
- Come over here, min!
- Yes, sir.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:25:59.772
Ri jun-pyong, lower your weapon.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.023
Get it out before I cut you open!

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:36.107
Hello?

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.227
Ma'am, it's me, kang bong-rae.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:41.902
I'm with captain Cho's wife.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.695
- We didn't evacuate.
- What?

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.113
Listen to me carefully.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.486
The rise in temperature fits

01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:48.942
my estimations exactly.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.574
If there's still time, I
want to give it another go,

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.747
but we have to give new
location coordinates to Cho.

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:56.041
Qur comms are blocked.

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:59.711
If we have no other choice, we can steal.

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:04.542
We need the password for
comms channel access.

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.126
The security system is ccmp.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:07.836
At 126 bits... how do I explain this?

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:12.845
Yes, classified documents.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:50.466
This is nothing. I can do this.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:53.591
First, put the USB in.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.338
We'll escort you from here.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.343
That is all I can do for you.

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:38.718
And this cannot be the
government's official position.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:39.814
"Letter of resignation”

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:41.698
I guess that's why you
gave your resignation.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.273
Yes, Mr. president.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:45.809
I hope the decision you
made was the right one.

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.402
Thank you, sir.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.734
I'll have the resignation processed.

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:03.789
"3 hours 12 mins to final explosion”

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:19.305
To take care of records,
manage schedules and requests,

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:22.430
and handle projects conducted
via surplus budgets...

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:25.061
There's no better server
than a university's.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:26.186
Hey...

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.650
Yeah?

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:30.353
How did you know my
husband's in North Korea?

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.070
Well, that's...

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:39.454
I know because...

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:54.879
You ain't gonna shoot me
because of my insurance.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:00.888
You're right, but what about you?

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.140
Why haven't you shot me?

01:30:07.777 --> 01:30:13.488
You know I'm the only way
you can save your daughter.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:18.444
Even if you find her, you'll
never cross the border.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:22.372
Baekdu will erupt first.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:26.247
I have one question.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:30.372
Why are you so hung up on baekdu?

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:35.044
You really think your
stupid plan's gonna work?

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.267
"Yongsuri / bocheon"

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.067
No,

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.232
I don't.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.989
To be honest... I don't
know anything anymore.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:07.033
I don't know if we can set the thing off

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:10.996
or stop the volcano.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:16.595
Go.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:17.920
Take it with you.

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:20.005
Ji-young will be on board by now.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:24.096
That's the only reason
I'm here. My job is done.

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:28.267
Saving the day and being a hero?

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.144
I'm lucky I made it this far.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:34.399
So take the damn thing.

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.026
I'm tired.

01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:43.740
Yeah...

01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:55.164
How much time we got?

01:31:57.887 --> 01:32:00.674
I'll bet my sun-ok's life on you.

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:05.849
I hope we're not too late.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.899
Wait, ri!

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.655
You gotta give it back.

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:19.825
The map!

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:22.446
You're such a pain in my ass.

01:32:23.913 --> 01:32:25.995
Where'd he... professor?

01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:27.948
How did it go?

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:32.039
Pretty nerve-racking, thanks to you.

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:13.504
Hello?

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:14.588
In-Chang?

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.505
Ji-young?

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:18.592
Where are you?

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.418
What... you're not on the boat?

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:23.049
Where the hell are you?

01:33:23.723 --> 01:33:25.509
How could you go there?

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.965
I'm almost done.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.140
I'm coming. I'm sorry.

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.685
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:32.637
Again!

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:36.308
Captain Cho, I'm the senior
secretary to the president.

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:37.482
Do you have the detonator?

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:39.606
Wait. What's ji-young doing with you?

01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:41.904
Captain Cho, my name is Robert.

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:42.776
Who?

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:47.702
Rob... kang bong-rae.
I came up with the baekdu plan.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:49.825
Captain, can you confirm
you're headed to yongsuri?

01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:52.407
Put my wife on the phone.

01:33:52.502 --> 01:33:53.412
Ji-young?

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:56.001
I thought you were discharged
today. What're you doing there?

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:57.795
Please, miss, you need to calm down...

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:58.712
How can I be calm?

01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.539
Well, I...

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:00.820
Why didn't you get on the boat?

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:02.630
Captain Cho, captain Cho...

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.864
You said you wouldn't be late!

01:34:03.888 --> 01:34:05.950
You should've gotten on the boat.
Why didn't you listen to me?

01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:07.714
Mr. Cho, I mean, captain...

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.765
- Hey, excuse me!
- Can you hear me, captain?

01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:10.763
Put the person in charge on the phone.

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:11.872
Connect me to general choi.

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:15.730
It's not general choi. It's me.
I'm in charge.

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:18.183
I'm the reason you're in North Korea.

01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:19.814
So listen to me.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.608
You sent my husband to North Korea?

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:27.279
Not directly but... yes...

01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:30.324
I'm sorry, but give me a chance.

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:34.787
Calm down and listen to me.
There are new developments.

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:38.203
Your final destination has changed.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:42.958
You need fo go fo mine 7, not 9.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:44.052
What?

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:46.844
Section la-24 of mine 7 is our best shot.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:49.301
Do you understand?

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.473
Section la-24!

01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:54.306
It won't be easy, but you
need to go all the way down.

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:55.603
Something's not right.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.557
If we're going to yongsuri
with the detonator,

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:00.482
why is the us military going to bocheon?

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.607
Let me see that. Captain,
you still have the map?

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.220
Hye-sim!

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.802
Mom?

01:36:17.897 --> 01:36:20.513
Are you sun-ok?

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.855
You are...

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:35.119
What are you doing here?

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:41.876
It's okay. Come here.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:44.214
It's okay.

01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.762
Have some.

01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:01.388
This is...

01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:03.681
Sour and sweet.

01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:08.611
Here.

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:20.073
How come you're so thin?
Are your clothes too big?

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.249
The pant legs are short.

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:29.257
Say something. Why are you so quiet?

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:32.501
She can't talk.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:37.803
After what happened, it
would be strange if she could.

01:37:38.394 --> 01:37:41.386
Half this village is like that.

01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:11.795
You're late.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.008
Where's the package?

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:19.139
There's been a change.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.722
I don't have it with me.

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:32.149
Is that your daughter?

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:40.245
Let her cross the border, and
I'll tell you everything I know.

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:42.742
Please.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:48.544
The air is shit here.

01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:54.217
I confirmed the package,
but you don't have it?

01:38:56.639 --> 01:39:00.803
Do you know how many times
you've screwed me over?

01:39:01.644 --> 01:39:02.644
You want me to kill you?

01:39:02.728 --> 01:39:06.562
I'll tell you everything
once we get out of here.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:10.691
Baekdu's gonna erupt again.
You gotta believe me.

01:39:11.404 --> 01:39:12.735
Believe what I'm saying!

01:39:14.198 --> 01:39:17.941
What's the matter? You're
not acting like yourself.

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:24.374
Get out of the way!

01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:34.332
Come here.

01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:35.427
Run!

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:43.175
What the hell?

01:39:43.769 --> 01:39:45.384
Did you bring them here?

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:54.353
What are you, some rogue spy conning me?

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:20.344
Stop!

01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:31.399
Don't shoot!

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:33.109
Don't shoot!

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:34.646
Don't shoot!

01:40:35.738 --> 01:40:37.228
Everybody! Don't shoot!

01:40:39.825 --> 01:40:41.531
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.539
What's going on?

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:51.413
I have the detonator.

01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:54.083
Translate that I have the detonator.

01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:55.708
What are you doing?

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:57.040
The location's changed.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:40:59.375
Dammit, why'd you swallow the map?

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:02.382
Who the fuck is he?

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:07.642
You speak Korean? Good!
I'm the crazy asshole

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.635
with the detonator.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:11.311
And you want it, don't you?

01:41:11.566 --> 01:41:14.433
Come on. Take it.

01:41:27.123 --> 01:41:28.408
Don't shoot.

01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:32.708
Here.

01:41:49.854 --> 01:41:51.219
What's this?

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.270
Stop the timer!

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:03.109
Now!

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200
Do it!

01:42:14.086 --> 01:42:15.086
Stop it!

01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:22.501
No stop. There's no stop
button. Do you understand?

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:25.048
You sure you wanna be here?

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:28.340
This will go off soon.
If you want to leave, go.

01:42:39.487 --> 01:42:41.694
Bring me the phone!

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:47.546
We have the package, but there's a problem.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.246
What a shitshow.

01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:08.139
Wait! Stop!

01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:09.638
No!

01:43:10.226 --> 01:43:12.387
There's no stop button! No stop!

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:13.927
Wait! Stop!

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:19.148
Stop! Stop!

01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:27.941
The timer is set to the
estimated explosion of baekdu.

01:43:28.285 --> 01:43:30.867
Whether it blows up here
or the mountain erupts,

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:34.789
just leave it to me and get the hell out.

01:43:34.959 --> 01:43:38.872
All of you, go. Get out of here!

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:42.251
Crazy dumb-ass...

01:44:03.779 --> 01:44:04.859
Let's go.

01:44:08.617 --> 01:44:09.527
Let's go.

01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:10.637
We're getting out of here.

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:11.661
Get in the car!

01:44:19.128 --> 01:44:20.993
Min, get tae-sik. We're getting out.

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.088
Yes, sir.

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:30.728
Transfer him to a hospital
and report to base.

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:32.671
What? No, I'm staying with you.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:35.884
Who will drive? Take ri and the kid and go.

01:44:35.978 --> 01:44:38.970
Make sure the 4 of you return
safely. That's an order.

01:44:39.064 --> 01:44:40.224
4 of us?

01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:48.108
I started the timer, I'll see it through.

01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:50.485
Tell me the new route and get out of here.

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:53.568
You hit the timer because of me.

01:44:54.872 --> 01:45:00.913
If this fails, my daughter won't be safe.

01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:05.462
I know the way. You can't do this alone.

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:17.641
We really don't have time for this.
You know what you're doing?

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:19.229
Of course, I do.

01:45:49.677 --> 01:45:54.637
I'm happy I got to see you.

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:04.354
That's enough for me.

01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:23.908
Let's go!

01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:56.111
Ji-young, it's captain Cho.

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:05.658
Hey, cutie cute. This is
taking longer than planned,

01:47:05.836 --> 01:47:07.647
but I'm almost done. I'm
going home right after.

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:08.251
In-Chang...

01:47:08.464 --> 01:47:09.670
Are you okay?

01:47:10.966 --> 01:47:12.126
Our little baby's doing good?

01:47:12.217 --> 01:47:13.957
You're taking your vitamins?

01:47:14.053 --> 01:47:16.669
I know what you're doing.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.677
Sweetie, really...

01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:22.304
Don't be late.

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:27.809
Don't be late so you can
meet our baby in person, okay?

01:47:30.861 --> 01:47:32.021
I'm sorry, ji-young.

01:47:32.905 --> 01:47:35.487
Go home. I'll make sure everything's okay.

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:36.939
I'll make sure.

01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:37.693
In-Chang...

01:47:37.785 --> 01:47:38.865
- I promise.
- In-Chang!

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:40.284
Wait!

01:47:56.595 --> 01:47:57.960
You okay?

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.715
I think we have a problem.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:04.683
I'm going into labor.

01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:05.850
What?

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:40.673
You sure we can do this?

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.348
Shit!

01:48:43.058 --> 01:48:44.343
Hey!

01:49:50.167 --> 01:49:51.748
This way.

01:49:55.214 --> 01:49:56.954
Is this it? Is this right?

01:49:57.716 --> 01:49:58.956
Go straight.

01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:05.721
To the right.

01:50:05.808 --> 01:50:07.048
The right!

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.020
Excuse me.

01:50:11.063 --> 01:50:11.597
Help us!

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:12.688
Inside please.

01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:14.975
Okay. Hurry.

01:50:15.234 --> 01:50:15.973
Hang in there.

01:50:16.068 --> 01:50:18.229
We have a patient here.

01:50:18.779 --> 01:50:19.689
What's happening?

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:22.271
She's having a baby. She's
been in labor for 20 minutes.

01:50:22.366 --> 01:50:23.401
This way.

01:50:23.992 --> 01:50:25.528
She's before her due date.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.485
- Outside!
- Okay, outside.

01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:29.820
Hurry!

01:50:31.208 --> 01:50:33.915
Careful.

01:50:35.921 --> 01:50:37.001
Careful!

01:50:37.089 --> 01:50:38.169
Go on.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:39.298
Go outside.

01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:51.091
I think it's just after this.

01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:13.951
The generator is out. We're screwed.

01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:20.955
Oh, shit!

01:51:23.677 --> 01:51:25.338
What do we do now?

01:51:29.558 --> 01:51:30.889
Wait...

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:32.518
Wait a minute.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.785
What are you doing?

01:51:57.252 --> 01:51:59.288
If we cut the cable, we can still go down.

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:01.248
Are you mad?

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.796
Do you know how deep these shafts go?

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:05.833
Got any other ideas?

01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:15.801
I guess we die either way.

01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:25.777
Hold on.

01:52:36.458 --> 01:52:38.039
They all die.

01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:40.461
What?

01:52:41.129 --> 01:52:43.165
In the TV show damo, they all die.

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:46.423
Min told me.

01:52:49.221 --> 01:52:52.964
So that's how it ends?

01:52:54.768 --> 01:52:57.100
I feel so sorry for chae-ok.

01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:04.641
Get another rope.

01:53:04.736 --> 01:53:05.851
Okay.

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:19.160
Now that I know the ending,
I got something to tell you.

01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:23.501
Wait...

01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:29.125
What are you doing?

01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:38.301
Actually, I don't know if
you're having a boy or a girl,

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:41.182
so go see for yourself.

01:53:42.232 --> 01:53:44.348
Quit fucking around and open this.

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.852
I'll take it from here.

01:53:48.739 --> 01:53:51.481
I got nowhere to go anyway.

01:53:53.702 --> 01:53:56.068
You go keep your promise.

01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:57.660
Goddammitt!

01:53:59.791 --> 01:54:02.077
Open this! Come on!

01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:03.867
Get out of there!

01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:11.004
Can you promise me something?

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:13.551
Sun-ok

01:54:14.389 --> 01:54:16.755
she doesn't have anyone,

01:54:17.434 --> 01:54:21.768
and you're the only person I trust now.

01:54:23.857 --> 01:54:24.937
Will you...

01:54:30.447 --> 01:54:31.778
Take care of her?

01:54:37.412 --> 01:54:40.199
Please don't do this.

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.997
I've never...

01:54:53.804 --> 01:54:55.669
Been a father

01:54:57.766 --> 01:54:59.427
so you go

01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:03.344
and be one.

01:55:03.522 --> 01:55:06.480
No, don't you...

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.103
No!

01:55:09.361 --> 01:55:11.317
Don't do it.

01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:13.566
Don't do this. Come on.

01:55:14.324 --> 01:55:15.780
Get out of there.

01:55:16.827 --> 01:55:18.488
Get out of there now.

01:55:18.954 --> 01:55:20.114
Dammitt!

01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:21.619
Please!

01:55:21.706 --> 01:55:23.412
Hey, cutie kaka...

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:27.205
You know why you ain't got eyes
in the back of your head?

01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:29.916
So you don't look back.

01:55:30.006 --> 01:55:31.086
Dammit!

01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.574
You need to push, okay?

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:46.370
You're doing great! One more time!

01:56:47.292 --> 01:56:48.623
Do we have a doctor here?

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:23.108
"La-24"

01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:35.597
It's sweet...

01:59:24.783 --> 01:59:30.028
"Pyongyang"

01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:40.704
1 'seo ul"

02:00:15.417 --> 02:00:19.626
"1 year later"

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:25.298
the ceremony celebrating the reconstruction
of Korea is attended by leaders of parties,

02:00:25.552 --> 02:00:30.012
guests from abroad, and thousands of
citizens filling gwanghwamun square.

02:00:30.557 --> 02:00:35.301
There are 3 things to note
in the president's speech.

02:00:35.770 --> 02:00:40.309
One, the reconstruction committee will
consist of both south and North Korea.

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:43.187
Shouldn't you be there?

02:00:43.278 --> 02:00:45.234
When did you come out?

02:00:45.321 --> 02:00:47.687
Just now. What's that?

02:00:47.699 --> 02:00:48.779
"Welcome Robert”

02:00:48.783 --> 02:00:50.364
it's a welcome for you.

02:00:50.368 --> 02:00:53.280
Couldn't you at least
write Robert in english?

02:00:54.664 --> 02:00:56.871
How long are you staying this time?

02:00:56.958 --> 02:00:58.728
I was asked to take part
in the reconstruction.

02:00:58.752 --> 02:01:04.668
I'm researching regenerative
energy using volcanic heat.

02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:06.957
That's just an excuse...

02:01:09.137 --> 02:01:12.721
I decided to settle here.

02:01:13.183 --> 02:01:17.426
I've grown attached to this country.

02:01:19.314 --> 02:01:20.804
Welcome back, Rob...

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:23.935
Mr. kang bong-rae.

02:01:30.033 --> 02:01:34.117
Seoul Metro reconstruction has reached 74%.

02:01:34.204 --> 02:01:35.865
Water and electricity are 100% restored,

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.946
daddy made yummy food?

02:01:42.378 --> 02:01:43.709
He did. Let's eat.

02:01:43.713 --> 02:01:45.294
Okay, let's eat.

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:50.125
Dinner time.

02:01:51.805 --> 02:01:54.421
Dinner time.

02:01:55.016 --> 02:01:57.678
Let's have dinner, sun-ok.

02:02:02.857 --> 02:02:03.937
Wait.

02:02:05.276 --> 02:02:06.356
Did you hear that?

02:02:06.444 --> 02:02:07.274
You heard it, sun-ok?

02:02:07.362 --> 02:02:08.647
He just called me dad.

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.270
He did. I swear.

02:02:10.365 --> 02:02:11.605
He said ma.

02:02:14.369 --> 02:02:16.030
Pretty sure it was ma.

02:02:16.913 --> 02:02:18.198
See?

02:02:18.289 --> 02:02:21.781
No, sun-ok. Think again. He said da.

02:02:22.085 --> 02:02:22.870
Ma.

02:02:23.044 --> 02:02:25.581
My daughter is so smart!

02:02:25.713 --> 02:02:28.375
No one is on my side in this family.

02:02:28.842 --> 02:02:30.378
But he clearly said da.

02:02:30.468 --> 02:02:31.468
Ma.

02:02:31.511 --> 02:02:32.921
Let's agree to disagree.

02:02:33.012 --> 02:02:34.012
Da.

02:02:38.434 --> 02:02:40.720
Come here, you.
