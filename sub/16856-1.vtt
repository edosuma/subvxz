Owen: Previously
on "childrens hospital"...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.671
We're gonna have to evacuate
the hospital for 14 weeks.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.073
However, I got us all a job
as a private contractor

00:08.074 --> 00:09.875
At an army base in japan.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.277
But we're ambassadors,
so no betting on the operations.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.847
Are you paying me to keep quiet
while you throw this surgery

00:14.849 --> 00:16.081
Because
you bet money on it?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.616
Uh-huh.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.085
Tripper: You doctors have been
a real asset to the base.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.121
You got the pediatric clinic
on its feet

00:22.123 --> 00:24.056
And provided a lot of laughs
along the way.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.624
It's what we do.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.761
Ha! It's zingers like that
that I'm gonna miss the most.

00:28.763 --> 00:32.064
But now you all have to go back
to childrens hospital.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.299
Owen: It's gonna be nice
to get back to brazil...
Cat: Yeah.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.602
...Which, as we all know,
is where we were based

00:36.604 --> 00:38.537
Before we took this job
in japan...
Yeah.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.373
...Which is, as we also know,
where we've been.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.143
And where we are.
This is japan.
Yeah.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.978
Owen maestro,
you're under arrest!

I love you, cat.

I...

00:55.256 --> 00:56.688
You've been found guilty

00:56.690 --> 00:59.591
Of colluding with
a criminal surgery-fixing ring.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.793
I hereby sentence you

01:00.795 --> 01:03.062
To five years in
a maximum-security penitentiary.

we've found ourselves in.

[ chuckles ] thanks, guys.
Hit the lights!

01:26.987 --> 01:28.387

01:31.192 --> 01:34.460
Hey, before you guys go, listen,
as you all know,

01:34.462 --> 01:36.728
My boyfriend, owen,
gets out of prison today,

01:36.730 --> 01:39.531
And, you know, he's been
locked up for five years,

01:39.533 --> 01:40.732
So make him feel at home.
[ chuckles ]

01:40.734 --> 01:42.668
Aw. Don't worry, cat.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.769
I have him scheduled

01:43.771 --> 01:47.072
For a very difficult
heart surgery today, so...

01:47.074 --> 01:48.373
That'll help.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.109
He hasn't performed surgery
in five years.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.376
I mean,
how's that gonna help?

01:51.378 --> 01:53.378
In ways I couldn't
possibly describe

01:53.380 --> 01:54.713
Without
incriminating myself.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.883
Hey, cat, uh,
you know what val and I do

01:57.885 --> 01:58.917
When we feel out of place?

01:58.919 --> 02:01.653
No.
We look at our award!

02:04.391 --> 02:06.358

what got into us that day.

It's like
time just slowed down.

about that.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.241
Oh, yes!
I missed the backpack so much!

02:22.243 --> 02:24.143
Thanks for
not ratting me out.

I'll make it up to you
somehow.

02:27.882 --> 02:31.783

for almost a minute.

Why aren't you riding this thing
in a supply closet right now?

Because I'm pregnant.

to tell you guys.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.738
Owen, aren't you gonna
say anything?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.741
I don't know
what to say.

02:55.743 --> 02:59.278
How about, "hello,"
to your unborn child, say?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
Cat, I haven't seen you
in five years.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.884

seven months ago?

03:06.519 --> 03:14.126
That never happened,
so I call it...Fiction.

Welcome back!
I'm so sorry.

03:25.139 --> 03:28.740
We had to re-zone your office
as a public fart room.

here at childrens.

your performance drops 4%,

you're out on your ass.

It's corporate policy.

in here?

Smells like broken promises
to me, cat.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.107
Mm. No, it really smells
like a bathroom.

How could you cheat on me
and claim that baby is mine?

inside of me --

"that one
had a baby in it!"

in lockup.

What a coincidence.

I don't believe
in coincidences.

Then what are you
doing here, pippin,

not a coincidence?
