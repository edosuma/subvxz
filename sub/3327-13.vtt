WEBVTT

00:11.409 --> 00:12.875
It's cleanliness
everywhere I look.

00:12.877 --> 00:14.493
It's very
disorientating.

00:14.495 --> 00:17.947
Don't worry, I did not
touch your wall of crazy.

00:17.949 --> 00:19.915
The idea that Irene was murdered

00:19.917 --> 00:22.751
by a shadowy kingpin that no
one's ever seen or heard of

00:22.753 --> 00:24.086
sounded crazy
to me, too.

00:24.088 --> 00:26.589
But there may be
a pattern here.

00:26.591 --> 00:29.542
A trail of bread crumbs that
leads to a great criminal mind.

00:29.544 --> 00:32.293
And how is
Napoleon Bonaparte involved?

00:32.296 --> 00:35.264
By my fifth night without
sleep, I may have been reaching.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.132
What time is it?

00:37.134 --> 00:38.634
Uh, it's 9:30.

00:38.636 --> 00:40.102
Wednesday.

00:40.104 --> 00:42.638
You slept for
two days straight.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.590
That's why I'm so hungry.

00:44.592 --> 00:46.925
I'm supposed to go out
for a little while,

00:46.927 --> 00:49.278
but if you're still
feeling obsessed, I can stay.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.946
No, I'm fine.

00:50.948 --> 00:52.648
I've been
neglecting my hobby.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.284
I'm going to visit
Swirl-Theory.com

00:55.286 --> 00:57.620
and discuss
conspiracy theories.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.271
Your hobby is
conspiracy theories?

00:59.273 --> 01:00.539
No, of course not.

01:00.541 --> 01:01.957
They're pure sophistry.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.108
Large groups of people
cannot keep secrets.

01:04.111 --> 01:06.545
My hobby is
conspiracy <i>theorists.</i>

01:06.547 --> 01:07.630
I adore them.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.049
As one would
a barmy uncle.

01:10.051 --> 01:11.884
Or a pet that can't stop
walking into walls.

01:11.886 --> 01:14.386
Have you ever heard anyone say
the CIA invented crack cocaine?

01:14.388 --> 01:15.638
I have.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.805
I started that.

01:16.807 --> 01:17.890
That's ridiculous.

01:17.892 --> 01:19.291
Mm.

01:19.293 --> 01:21.727
Today, I plan to get
in touch with Zapruder--

01:21.729 --> 01:23.646
that's the moderator's
nom de plume--

01:23.648 --> 01:26.482
and share with him the results
of a secret government study,

01:26.484 --> 01:28.300
which concludes that
rising ocean waters

01:28.302 --> 01:32.137
will soon make a new coastline
in the Appalachian foothills.

01:32.139 --> 01:34.490
Plans are afoot to move
the nation's capital to Omaha,

01:34.492 --> 01:36.158
and a cadre of
elite billionaires

01:36.160 --> 01:38.327
is buying up soon-to-be
beachfront property.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.413
Okay, well, good
luck with that.

01:41.415 --> 01:44.500
Mm. Enjoy your errands.

01:45.585 --> 01:47.753
<i>Sherlock has made progress,</i>

01:47.755 --> 01:49.672
but he's fragile.

01:49.674 --> 01:53.092
Sebastian Moran upset
the balance that we found.

01:53.094 --> 01:56.462
He's finally ready to deal
with his feelings about Irene.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.614
He's only loved one person
in his life,

01:58.616 --> 02:00.833
as far as I can tell,
and she was murdered.

02:00.835 --> 02:03.335
Your contract to work as
Sherlock's sober companion

02:03.337 --> 02:04.836
expired a week ago.

02:04.838 --> 02:06.872
And if Sherlock
finds out,

02:06.874 --> 02:09.091
it could destroy the
trust you've built.

02:10.827 --> 02:12.695
Have you considered
that you yourself

02:12.697 --> 02:15.064
could be the catalyst
for a relapse?

02:15.066 --> 02:16.682
It's not forever.

02:16.684 --> 02:20.035
It may not be forever,
but it does sound indefinite.

02:20.037 --> 02:22.521
In the meantime,
you're not being paid.

02:22.523 --> 02:23.689
I'm not living
paycheck to paycheck.

02:23.691 --> 02:25.040
Nor are you obligated

02:25.042 --> 02:27.910
to spend your savings
on behalf of someone

02:27.912 --> 02:29.712
who's no longer your client.

02:31.365 --> 02:33.799
I should really check to see
if everything's okay.

02:40.257 --> 02:42.675
This thing with-with Sherlock,

02:42.677 --> 02:45.210
there are steps.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.563
Captain Gregson
suspended him from the NYPD.

02:47.565 --> 02:49.881
That relationship
stabilizes him.

02:49.883 --> 02:54.319
I just need to reopen that line
of communication between them.

03:00.243 --> 03:02.077
Watson.

03:02.079 --> 03:03.759
You want to tell me
whose house this is?

03:03.784 --> 03:04.664
Zapruder.

03:04.665 --> 03:07.032
Oh. Is that the guy you were
talking about this morning?

03:07.034 --> 03:08.233
The conspiracy theorist.

03:08.235 --> 03:10.068
His real name is
Len Pontecorvo.

03:10.070 --> 03:11.754
He didn't rise to
my bait earlier.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.355
Most unlike the man.

03:13.357 --> 03:15.090
I e-mailed several of his
colleagues in Swirl Theory.

03:15.092 --> 03:17.242
Turns out, no one has heard
from him since Sunday.

03:17.244 --> 03:19.094
Oh, so you decided to
break into his house?

03:19.096 --> 03:20.763
Well, his compatriots
feared the worst:

03:20.765 --> 03:22.431
black-bagged
by the KGB,

03:22.433 --> 03:24.249
taken to a secret
NASA prison.

03:24.251 --> 03:25.884
Please don't tell
me you agree.

03:25.886 --> 03:27.436
Of course not.
NASA doesn't maintain prisons.

03:27.438 --> 03:29.188
Everyone knows that.

03:29.190 --> 03:32.975
But I did think he may have had
a heart attack or an accident.

03:32.977 --> 03:36.061
Which is why I let myself in
when he didn't answer his door.

03:36.063 --> 03:38.597
This thing we're doing right
now, it's called trespassing.

03:38.599 --> 03:39.815
Well, if you're worried
about Mr. Pontecorvo

03:39.817 --> 03:41.700
pressing charges,
you shouldn't be.

03:41.702 --> 03:44.953
He's got much larger
problems than us.

04:12.421 --> 04:14.505
The department's
taking a break from you.

04:14.507 --> 04:16.671
And you, couldn't take him
to the movies or something?

04:16.771 --> 04:18.521
I tried.

04:18.523 --> 04:20.322
Would you have preferred we left
Mr. Pontecorvo to rot?

04:20.324 --> 04:22.658
I would've preferred
you laid low for a while,

04:22.660 --> 04:26.395
instead of digging up some
autoerotic strangulation case.

04:26.397 --> 04:28.030
Auto? You think he
did this to himself?

04:28.032 --> 04:29.898
You think he didn't?
Well, it's hard to tell

04:29.900 --> 04:31.233
without removing
the belt to examine

04:31.235 --> 04:32.701
the ligature marks
on his neck.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.570
But did notice
the belt itself is a 38.

04:34.572 --> 04:36.338
Rather large for a man
of such narrow proportions,

04:36.340 --> 04:38.340
don't you think?
Could've lost weight.

04:38.342 --> 04:41.243
Or he could've been strangled
by a much larger man

04:41.245 --> 04:43.546
and then hung on the machine
like a Christmas ornament.

04:43.548 --> 04:45.681
Also, notice the index finger
on his right hand.

04:45.683 --> 04:48.767
It appears to be fractured,
just above the finger nail.

04:48.769 --> 04:50.853
Hard to auto-eroticize anything
with a broken bone

04:50.855 --> 04:52.521
in your business hand, no?

04:52.523 --> 04:54.473
I'll tell the M.E.
to take a close look

04:54.475 --> 04:55.724
at the victim's neck and finger.

04:55.726 --> 04:57.259
Not necessary.
I already texted him.

04:57.261 --> 04:58.944
You text him?

04:58.946 --> 05:00.863
Seems like you think you're
a consultant on this case.

05:00.865 --> 05:01.930
You're not.

05:01.932 --> 05:03.482
Which is why I'm leaving.

05:03.484 --> 05:05.734
Right after Watson and I
examine the rest of the house.

05:05.736 --> 05:07.653
Let you know
if we learn anything.

05:08.622 --> 05:10.289
Been through the man's things.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.074
So far, none of
the conventional ways

05:12.076 --> 05:14.043
of getting oneself killed apply.

05:14.045 --> 05:15.777
Pontecorvo didn't owe
anyone money,

05:15.779 --> 05:17.830
he wasn't sleeping with
anyone's wife,

05:17.832 --> 05:18.964
wasn't sleeping with anyone.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.332
Uh, don't you
think the police

05:20.334 --> 05:21.884
are going to be interested
in looking at that?

05:21.886 --> 05:23.719
The police are interested in
finding the killer,

05:23.721 --> 05:26.172
which means they want any and
all evidence in my possession.

05:26.174 --> 05:27.673
Whether they admit it or not.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.642
Well, if all Pontecorvo did
was fill these binders,

05:29.644 --> 05:31.126
maybe we should
look through them, too.

05:31.128 --> 05:32.394
Hmm.

05:32.396 --> 05:34.129
This one says that
North Korea is actually

05:34.131 --> 05:37.233
the world's largest manufacturer
of high school textbooks.

05:37.235 --> 05:39.818
The Supreme Court has been
infiltrated by Scientologists.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.987
It's one of mine.

05:41.989 --> 05:43.572
Yes, we may as well
bring them with us.

05:43.574 --> 05:44.990
Worth a laugh, anyway.

05:44.992 --> 05:46.859
Although, I promise you,
there is a conventional

05:46.861 --> 05:49.111
explanation for Len
Pontecorvo's murder.

05:49.113 --> 05:50.412
Information wants
to get out, Watson.

05:50.414 --> 05:51.813
Which is why...

05:51.815 --> 05:53.365
There is no such thing
as conspiracies.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.533
We've covered this.

05:54.535 --> 05:57.253
Hello, Clyde.

05:57.255 --> 06:00.155
Oh, are you
taking Clyde?

06:00.157 --> 06:01.924
He will starve if we
leave him here.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.459
Oh, I didn't know
you liked tortoises.

06:03.461 --> 06:04.927
I love them.

06:04.929 --> 06:07.496
They make an absolutely
delicious soup stock.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:24.531 --> 06:25.731
What is that?

06:25.733 --> 06:28.867
It appears to be
a listening device.

06:28.869 --> 06:32.755
Someone was bugging
the conspiracy nut.

06:34.891 --> 06:36.542
You brought that
all the way over here

06:36.544 --> 06:38.744
just to smash
it to pieces?

06:38.746 --> 06:40.862
I turned it off.
I can't have it in the house.

06:40.864 --> 06:42.798
Don't know who's on
the other end of that thing.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.117
I've confirmed from
three different sources,

06:45.119 --> 06:46.502
this particular
surveillance device

06:46.504 --> 06:47.886
is not commercially
available.

06:47.888 --> 06:50.923
You cannot buy it
if you are a civilian.

06:50.925 --> 06:52.224
So, what are you saying,

06:52.226 --> 06:54.543
the government was
bugging Len Pontecorvo?

06:54.545 --> 06:56.512
I thought there was
no such thing as conspiracies?

06:56.514 --> 06:59.481
Consistency is the hobgoblin
of little minds, Watson.

06:59.483 --> 07:01.066
The fact of
the matter is,

07:01.068 --> 07:03.218
there was a bug in
Len Pontecorvo's home.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.687
One of my contacts
in London

07:04.689 --> 07:06.822
just helped me find
spyware on his laptop.

07:06.824 --> 07:09.158
Someone was monitoring
his every move.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.192
Why?

07:10.194 --> 07:11.560
Was he on to something?

07:11.562 --> 07:13.729
Len Pontecorvo, rest his soul,

07:13.731 --> 07:16.231
was one of the laziest thinkers
I've ever come across.

07:16.233 --> 07:19.084
His ideas are insane.

07:19.086 --> 07:20.836
Most of them, that is.

07:20.838 --> 07:23.589
There's one that isn't
immediately laughable.

07:23.591 --> 07:26.208
I hadn't read about it
until a short while ago.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.010
"The Red Team."

07:28.012 --> 07:29.128
Yes.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.764
The title refers
to war games.

07:31.766 --> 07:34.249
Every year,

07:34.251 --> 07:37.936
the Army War College
stages a series of them.

07:37.938 --> 07:40.939
Players consist of
military personnel

07:40.941 --> 07:43.425
and civilian experts.

07:43.427 --> 07:45.778
Those representing
the United States and its allies

07:45.780 --> 07:47.646
comprise the Blue Team.

07:47.648 --> 07:48.831
The Red Team are the bad guys.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.733
Hmm. The players
change every year,

07:50.735 --> 07:52.368
as do the scenarios
being tested.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.769
But every year,

07:53.771 --> 07:55.621
the results are published
in trade journals.

07:55.623 --> 07:57.573
Except for 2009.

07:57.575 --> 07:59.124
Those were
immediately classified.

07:59.126 --> 08:01.109
Why?
Nobody knows.

08:01.111 --> 08:04.129
That year's game was designed
to test the military response

08:04.131 --> 08:06.665
to the activation of
a sleeper cell in New York City.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.301
The Red Team's goal was to cause
maximum destruction

08:09.303 --> 08:11.136
and chaos
with minimum resources.

08:11.138 --> 08:12.921
Now, Len Pontecorvo believes

08:12.923 --> 08:15.174
they uncovered a flaw
in national security.

08:15.176 --> 08:17.176
Something so startling,
it was immediately declared

08:17.178 --> 08:18.594
a federal secret.

08:18.596 --> 08:20.262
That sounds scary.

08:20.264 --> 08:23.065
It also doesn't sound as crazy
as the other theories.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.600
Yeah.

08:24.602 --> 08:26.652
The identities of
the Red Teamers are classified.

08:26.654 --> 08:29.154
But Pontecorvo uncovered
one of them.

08:29.156 --> 08:30.572
A counterinsurgency expert

08:30.574 --> 08:32.107
called Martin Nagowski.

08:32.109 --> 08:34.693
But this says he died.

08:34.695 --> 08:36.328
He was killed a year
ago in a mugging.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.780
Pontecorvo believes
the mugging was staged

08:38.783 --> 08:41.316
and Nagowski was assassinated
to prevent him

08:41.318 --> 08:43.150
from revealing
the Red Team's secrets.

08:43.153 --> 08:44.837
Okay, you had me until then.

08:44.839 --> 08:46.655
The government doesn't just
go around killing people.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.841
It's easy enough to test
Pontecorvo's theory.

08:48.843 --> 08:50.676
I'll identify the rest
of the Red Team.

08:50.678 --> 08:52.845
If they're alive and well,
we'll move on.

08:52.847 --> 08:54.463
Oh, it's that easy.

08:54.465 --> 08:56.164
You're just going to find
five classified names?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.317
Why not? It's
my day off.

08:58.319 --> 08:59.885
And-and how does
the head of lettuce fit in?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.136
Oh, thank you.

09:01.138 --> 09:02.638
I nearly forgot.

09:04.858 --> 09:08.944
Can't make soup out of Clyde
until I fatten him up, Watson.

09:11.030 --> 09:13.699
That's sick.

09:16.119 --> 09:18.370
Sherlock feels terribly
about what happened.

09:18.372 --> 09:20.539
He'd tell you himself,
but you know how he is.

09:21.859 --> 09:23.992
What would it take
for him to come back?

09:23.994 --> 09:25.878
Is it just a matter
of sitting it out

09:25.880 --> 09:27.379
or do you want
a formal apology?

09:27.381 --> 09:29.030
You make it sound like he took

09:29.032 --> 09:30.532
my favorite shirt
without asking.

09:30.534 --> 09:33.001
Holmes planned to torture
and murder somebody.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.870
Sherlock thought that Moran
murdered the woman he loved.

09:34.872 --> 09:37.706
Which makes it natural to think
about paying him back.

09:37.708 --> 09:41.059
An employee of this department
does not act on those impulses.

09:41.061 --> 09:44.012
Do you want to know
what Sherlock can do? Nothing.

09:44.014 --> 09:47.065
And if I had to bet,
I'd say he's not even sorry.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.550
Now, I understand,

09:48.552 --> 09:50.102
you're worried
about your client,

09:50.104 --> 09:52.404
you think that he needs
this job to stay sober.

09:52.406 --> 09:53.889
I understand that.

09:53.891 --> 09:55.724
But he's broken,
and he's broken in a way

09:55.726 --> 09:57.159
that has nothing to do

09:57.161 --> 09:58.827
with whether or not
he's getting high.

09:59.864 --> 10:02.414
Oh, speak of the devil.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.416
Hmm.

10:04.418 --> 10:05.868
Writing to say he's sorry?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.788
<i>I'm sorry, I don't</i>

10:09.790 --> 10:11.957
remember him.

10:13.843 --> 10:15.410
You want to tell me why

10:15.412 --> 10:17.179
we're in a long-term
care facility in Queens?

10:17.181 --> 10:19.765
I spent the afternoon with
Len Pontecorvo's notes.

10:19.767 --> 10:21.433
Did a little
research of my own.

10:21.435 --> 10:23.101
Worked up a
list of names,

10:23.103 --> 10:25.086
people that I'm convinced
were on the Red Team.

10:25.088 --> 10:27.272
Carlo Anillo is
one of them.

10:27.274 --> 10:29.691
He booked travel to the town
that houses the War College

10:29.693 --> 10:31.193
on the days of the game.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.779
He has a PhD in
Civil Engineering.

10:33.781 --> 10:35.364
Hmm.

10:35.366 --> 10:36.698
What's his diagnosis?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.433
He was admitted
earlier in the year

10:38.435 --> 10:41.703
with early-onset
Alzheimer's.

10:41.705 --> 10:43.655
By all accounts,
his mind deteriorated

10:43.657 --> 10:45.324
in a matter of weeks.

10:45.326 --> 10:48.293
Curiously, no one in his family
has a history of the disease.

10:48.295 --> 10:49.711
That's strange.

10:49.713 --> 10:51.830
Almost every early-onset
case is familial.

10:51.832 --> 10:54.917
One member of the Red Team
killed in a mugging,

10:54.919 --> 10:57.836
one of them insensate in
a long-term care facility.

10:57.838 --> 11:00.055
It's enough to
make one curious.

11:00.057 --> 11:02.808
Well, you can't give
someone Alzheimer's.

11:02.810 --> 11:04.793
You said you're with the NYPD?

11:04.795 --> 11:06.294
Most of the
time, yes.

11:06.296 --> 11:07.896
You can talk to him now
if you want.

11:07.898 --> 11:10.399
Thank you.

11:12.018 --> 11:13.402
Mr. Anillo.

11:13.404 --> 11:14.469
My name is Sherlock.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.955
This is my
associate, Joan.

11:16.957 --> 11:18.407
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

11:18.409 --> 11:20.158
if that's all right.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.660
Sure, if you want.

11:21.662 --> 11:24.813
Do you remember
anything about the time

11:24.815 --> 11:26.582
just before you came
to the hospital?

11:26.584 --> 11:29.084
I'm sorry, no.

11:29.086 --> 11:31.436
Anything about your
work at Columbia?

11:32.872 --> 11:34.640
How about the Army?

11:34.642 --> 11:36.174
You participated
in a war game.

11:36.176 --> 11:40.229
My father was in the Marines.

11:40.231 --> 11:41.597
Vietnam.

11:44.517 --> 11:45.717
Mr. Anillo.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.686
Mr. Anillo?

11:47.688 --> 11:50.973
I'm sorry, what did you ask me?

11:52.859 --> 11:55.027
Does he do this often?

11:55.029 --> 11:57.779
You mean space out?

11:57.781 --> 11:59.648
Sure.
Well, I don't think he's spacing out.

11:59.650 --> 12:01.733
I think he's having
a micro-seizure.

12:01.735 --> 12:03.368
I don't think so.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.703
I asked the doctor about it.

12:04.705 --> 12:06.738
She said seizures don't happen

12:06.740 --> 12:08.457
to people with that
kind of Alzheimer's

12:08.459 --> 12:10.576
that Carlo has.

12:11.694 --> 12:14.796
You're confident
that was a seizure?

12:18.701 --> 12:20.302
You cannot give
someone Alzheimer's,

12:20.304 --> 12:22.537
but you may be able to mimic
its symptoms.

12:22.539 --> 12:25.223
Alzheimer's patients,
they don't have seizures.

12:25.225 --> 12:28.209
People who've been poisoned
with domoic acid do.

12:28.211 --> 12:30.762
Domoic acid-- that's what you
find in rotten shellfish.

12:30.764 --> 12:32.431
It is also a neurotoxin.

12:32.433 --> 12:35.684
It attacks the hippocampus,
the seat of memory in the brain.

12:35.686 --> 12:37.385
You give someone
a large enough dose,

12:37.387 --> 12:38.904
they'd lose virtually
their entire memory.

12:38.906 --> 12:41.406
They would appear to be
an Alzheimer's patient.

12:41.408 --> 12:43.358
You think someone poisoned
Carlo Anillo?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.910
Why not?

12:44.912 --> 12:47.112
Murder is just one way
to stop someone from talking.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.364
This is much more creative.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.667
The beauty is we can test
to see if I'm right.

12:51.669 --> 12:53.535
If Anillo was dosed,

12:53.537 --> 12:54.953
we'll know that someone
was targeting

12:54.955 --> 12:57.238
the 2009 members
of the Red Team,

12:57.240 --> 12:59.508
and that that person killed
Len Pontecorvo.

13:04.081 --> 13:06.131
We're talking an awful lot
for two guys

13:06.133 --> 13:07.883
who aren't supposed
to be working together.

13:07.885 --> 13:09.818
Shh, listen to me.
It is highly possible

13:09.820 --> 13:11.186
that Len Pontecorvo's murderer

13:11.188 --> 13:13.221
poisoned a man
called Carlo Anillo

13:13.223 --> 13:16.224
and murdered someone named
Martin Nagowski, maybe others.

13:16.226 --> 13:19.277
We need to look into a war game
that was conducted in 2009.

13:19.279 --> 13:21.613
No, Holmes, stop talking.

13:21.615 --> 13:23.649
We just arrested the guy
that killed Pontecorvo.

13:23.651 --> 13:24.983
I beg your pardon?

13:24.985 --> 13:26.535
Yeah, it's a guy
named Gary Sullivan

13:26.537 --> 13:28.436
from the chat room he moderated.

13:28.438 --> 13:29.771
They got into a flame war

13:29.773 --> 13:32.273
over some moon landing
conspiracy theory.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.326
Sullivan confronted him
in person.

13:34.328 --> 13:35.610
Things got out of hand.

13:35.612 --> 13:37.112
They guy felt so bad
about what he did,

13:37.114 --> 13:38.780
he turned himself in.
I don't know where

13:38.782 --> 13:40.782
this poison stuff
is coming from,

13:40.784 --> 13:43.301
but Sullivan didn't mean
to kill Len Pontecorvo.

13:43.303 --> 13:44.836
It was an accident.

13:53.646 --> 13:55.279
Just so
I'm understanding you correctly,

13:55.917 --> 13:57.249
neither of you believe

13:57.251 --> 13:58.801
that Neil Armstrong walked
on the moon?

13:58.803 --> 14:00.103
Of course not.
That's not the issue.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.222
The issue is who staged
the fake landing.

14:05.776 --> 14:07.477
Excuse me.

14:10.782 --> 14:11.948
Well, it's obvious that that man

14:11.950 --> 14:13.282
is not the mastermind
of anything.

14:13.284 --> 14:15.218
What are you doing here?

14:15.220 --> 14:16.953
I'm trying to figure out
what happened.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.437
Now, Pontecorvo's murder
may have been happenstance.

14:18.439 --> 14:19.772
That doesn't mean

14:19.774 --> 14:21.374
that I'm wrong
about the Red Team.

14:21.376 --> 14:23.209
Carlo Anillo was poisoned.

14:23.211 --> 14:24.961
I mean, why are you
in this building

14:24.963 --> 14:26.162
when you're suspended?

14:26.164 --> 14:27.880
Captain, lives may be at stake.

14:27.882 --> 14:30.550
We need to find the members
of the Red Team and warn them.

14:30.552 --> 14:32.251
The department
appreciates your tip

14:32.253 --> 14:34.337
in leading to the arrest
of Gary Sullivan.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.139
Concerned citizens
such as yourself

14:36.141 --> 14:38.290
play an important role
Why are you talking like that?

14:38.292 --> 14:39.725
in keeping this city safe.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.144
Are you listening to me?

14:41.146 --> 14:43.813
Lives are at stake
every day here, Holmes,

14:43.815 --> 14:47.984
and yet we had a department
and a city before you got here.

14:47.986 --> 14:49.819
You talk your way

14:49.821 --> 14:51.487
into that
interrogation room again,

14:51.489 --> 14:54.941
and I will have you
arrested for trespassing.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.948
Are you okay?

15:01.950 --> 15:05.751
Punishment, as if
that accomplishes anything.

15:05.753 --> 15:07.286
Does he really think
that we need

15:07.288 --> 15:09.121
the NYPD's resources
to investigate?

15:09.123 --> 15:11.090
Don't we?
Of course we don't.

15:11.092 --> 15:12.658
We'll just trace
the surveillance device

15:12.660 --> 15:17.046
we found at Pontecorvo's home
back to its source.

15:20.652 --> 15:22.852
It's bad enough you're making
me sit in a rental car.

15:22.854 --> 15:23.853
Okay, I am not gonna

15:23.855 --> 15:25.170
listen to static anymore.

15:25.172 --> 15:26.672
It's my turn to
choose the song.

15:26.674 --> 15:29.475
You chose some abysmal racket;
I choose static.

15:29.477 --> 15:30.860
I find it conducive to thought.

15:30.862 --> 15:33.112
Static is not a song;
it doesn't end.

15:35.783 --> 15:37.867
How can you be sure the person
who bugged Pontecorvo's house

15:37.869 --> 15:39.652
is actually gonna
come back for it?

15:39.654 --> 15:42.488
If there was one bug in there,
the odds are there are others.

15:42.490 --> 15:45.041
Whoever left it there won't want
to risk someone finding it.

15:45.043 --> 15:46.626
The place was in the hands
of the police

15:46.628 --> 15:47.994
until an hour ago,
so they couldn't fetch

15:47.996 --> 15:49.095
their things until now.

15:49.097 --> 15:50.362
The TV satellite truck

15:50.364 --> 15:52.832
that pulled up 20
minutes ago, hmm.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.001
He clearly isn't here
to install anything.

15:55.003 --> 15:57.303
So it seems
that he is posing as a worker.

15:57.305 --> 15:58.838
And when he realizes

15:58.840 --> 16:00.506
there is no surveillance device
in the terrarium,

16:00.508 --> 16:01.757
we'll simply follow him

16:01.759 --> 16:04.894
back to whoever he works for.

16:04.896 --> 16:06.345
Have you thought
about maybe going

16:06.347 --> 16:08.731
and apologizing
to Captain Gregson?

16:08.733 --> 16:11.117
Might go a long way.
The man is a practiced interrogator.

16:11.119 --> 16:12.652
He knows an insincerity
when he hears one.

16:12.654 --> 16:14.770
There's no part
of you that feels

16:14.772 --> 16:16.857
even a little bad
about what you did?

16:16.882 --> 16:17.842
I don't want to discuss this.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.084
Well, sometimes you have
to talk about things that

16:19.085 --> 16:20.145
make you feel uncomfortable.

16:20.194 --> 16:21.744
I won't feel uncomfortable;
you will.

16:21.746 --> 16:22.346
Why?

16:22.371 --> 16:24.331
I'm smarter
than everyone I meet, Watson.

16:24.332 --> 16:26.666
I know it's bad form
to say that,

16:26.668 --> 16:28.501
but in my case, it's a fact.

16:28.503 --> 16:29.902
Allowances have to be made.

16:29.904 --> 16:31.070
Allowances?

16:31.072 --> 16:32.255
It's true

16:32.257 --> 16:33.906
I have wronged Captain Gregson.

16:33.908 --> 16:36.926
It was the cost of revenge,
and I incurred it willingly.

16:36.928 --> 16:38.744
The larger question is

16:38.746 --> 16:40.713
how does my suspension
benefit the city?

16:40.715 --> 16:42.081
If the role
of the public servant

16:42.083 --> 16:43.849
is to keep an eye
on the greater good,

16:43.851 --> 16:45.184
then why keep me from my work?

16:45.186 --> 16:47.136
My work is the greater good.

16:49.523 --> 16:50.806
See, you're uncomfortable.

16:51.558 --> 16:52.775
Oh, fortunately,

16:52.777 --> 16:54.143
we will soon have driving

16:54.145 --> 16:55.695
to distract us.

17:32.733 --> 17:33.849
Your bug?

17:42.826 --> 17:45.477
What is this place?

17:45.479 --> 17:47.446
Howdy.

17:47.448 --> 17:49.648
We mostly do business
by appointment here.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.483
Howdy.

17:51.485 --> 17:54.036
Thought you might
want this back.

17:56.206 --> 17:57.823
What is this place?

17:57.825 --> 17:59.041
NSA? CIA?

17:59.043 --> 18:00.059
Army Intelligence?

18:00.061 --> 18:02.511
We do market research.

18:04.514 --> 18:06.015
It's been slow.

18:06.017 --> 18:08.500
So, who are you guys, anyway?

18:08.502 --> 18:10.002
My name is
Sherlock Holmes.

18:10.004 --> 18:11.771
I am a temporarily
suspended consultant

18:11.773 --> 18:13.222
for the NYPD.

18:13.224 --> 18:14.673
This is Joan Watson.

18:14.675 --> 18:16.525
She keeps me
from doing heroin.

18:16.527 --> 18:17.676
And you would be?

18:17.678 --> 18:19.595
Bill.

18:19.597 --> 18:21.447
Bill.

18:21.449 --> 18:24.650
Well, Bill, we know that the man
who just walked into this office

18:24.652 --> 18:26.702
was surveilling Len Pontecorvo.

18:26.704 --> 18:28.371
Bob? No, his sister works here.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.622
They're going out to lunch.

18:29.624 --> 18:30.856
I also suspect

18:30.858 --> 18:32.241
that this office
is keeping an eye

18:32.243 --> 18:34.210
on the 2009 members
of the Red Team.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.361
Red Team?
Yes.

18:36.363 --> 18:38.047
Those it hasn't
already attacked yet.

18:38.049 --> 18:40.365
If, in fact,
you are engaged

18:40.367 --> 18:42.201
in a plan to eliminate
those citizens,

18:42.203 --> 18:44.837
I would like you to know
that I know who they are.

18:44.839 --> 18:45.805
Veena Mehta,

18:45.807 --> 18:47.223
professor of anthropology,

18:47.225 --> 18:48.924
expert in Middle
Eastern cultures;

18:48.926 --> 18:50.259
Solomon Zyckner,

18:50.261 --> 18:52.311
probability and statistics guru;

18:52.313 --> 18:53.896
Sheldon Frost, the cartographer;

18:53.898 --> 18:55.564
Harold Dresden, mathematician;

18:55.566 --> 18:58.017
Leland Tantowicz,
weapons field expert;

18:58.019 --> 18:59.368
and of course,
Walter McClenahan,

18:59.370 --> 19:01.771
Lieutenant Colonel, retired.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.388
Well, it sounds like
they would make

19:03.390 --> 19:04.490
an interesting dinner party.

19:04.492 --> 19:06.325
Mm.

19:06.327 --> 19:08.444
I'm gonna make quite certain
that nothing happens to them.

19:08.446 --> 19:09.945
Good for you.

19:11.732 --> 19:12.915
I got to ask, though.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.001
If the Army
or the CIA or whoever

19:16.003 --> 19:18.904
wanted to kill a bunch of people
who did something back in 2009,

19:18.906 --> 19:21.573
why would any of them
still be alive today?

19:21.575 --> 19:23.242
It's the Army.

19:23.244 --> 19:25.594
They get some helicopters,
some rocket launchers and stuff,

19:25.596 --> 19:28.631
and take care of it
all in one night.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.852
That'd be my advice, anyway.

19:32.854 --> 19:34.353
And you can keep that.

19:34.355 --> 19:37.807
Never seen it before.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.144
Well, okay.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.863
Well, that was either
a waste of time,

19:43.865 --> 19:46.315
or I'm gonna be audited every
year for the rest of my life.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.700
Wasn't a waste.

19:47.702 --> 19:49.268
I listed the names
of some of the people

19:49.270 --> 19:50.870
I thought <i>might</i> be
on the Red Team.

19:50.872 --> 19:52.771
Our friend, Bill,
ground his teeth

19:52.773 --> 19:54.457
for some names
but not others.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.908
You were testing him?

19:55.910 --> 19:57.793
And now I know
the identities

19:57.795 --> 20:00.162
of all of the
team members.

20:00.164 --> 20:03.115
Detective Bell, how can I help?

20:03.117 --> 20:05.384
So, we just got the results
of the tox screen

20:05.386 --> 20:07.086
we ran on Carlo Anillo.

20:07.088 --> 20:09.555
He was poisoned
with domoic acid.

20:09.557 --> 20:11.390
Gregson wants to hear
everything you know.

20:11.392 --> 20:12.925
Happy to oblige,

20:12.927 --> 20:14.810
as long as you'll get me
a visitor's pass.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.134
Walter McClanahan,
systems analyst

20:22.136 --> 20:23.853
and Lieutenant
Colonel retired.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.404
What do you people want?
You're a hard man to find.

20:25.406 --> 20:27.273
Six addresses
in two years.

20:27.275 --> 20:29.191
Would you come
with me, please?

20:37.483 --> 20:39.251
Something wrong?

20:39.253 --> 20:41.453
Who are these people?

20:41.455 --> 20:43.606
That's Veena Mehta,
Harold Dresden,

20:43.608 --> 20:46.342
Sheldon Frost, but I
suspect you know that.

20:46.344 --> 20:48.711
Gentlemen, Miss Mehta,

20:48.713 --> 20:52.331
I know that I'm addressing the
2009 members of the Red Team.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.301
Those of you who are well enough
to be walking around, anyway.

20:55.303 --> 20:57.686
I'm a free citizen of the United States;
I'd like to leave now.

20:57.688 --> 20:59.722
Nobody's holding you
here, Mr. McClanahan.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.190
Walt,

21:01.192 --> 21:03.392
these people aren't
with the Army.

21:03.394 --> 21:06.028
Let's just, uh,
calm down.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.897
Sit down, huh?

21:07.899 --> 21:10.115
Let's hear what they want.

21:12.185 --> 21:16.155
I believe
that you're all in danger.

21:16.157 --> 21:20.159
Now, some you may know
that Martin Nagowski is dead.

21:20.161 --> 21:21.410
I believe that
his murder

21:21.412 --> 21:23.412
was planned.

21:23.414 --> 21:25.030
I know for a fact

21:25.032 --> 21:27.366
that Carlo Anillo
was poisoned.

21:27.368 --> 21:28.834
You're here
because the four of you

21:28.836 --> 21:30.336
were brilliant enough
to help develop a plan

21:30.338 --> 21:32.871
that paralyzed the Army
with fear.

21:32.873 --> 21:35.474
I'm hoping that you might
be able to provide some insight

21:35.476 --> 21:37.092
as to who's trying to harm you.

21:37.094 --> 21:40.379
We should talk,
but I'm not going first.

21:40.381 --> 21:42.565
We took an oath, Sheldon.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.600
If we all talk, nobody
can report anyone else.

21:44.602 --> 21:46.252
Saying a single
word to these people

21:46.254 --> 21:47.686
is treason.

21:54.361 --> 21:56.078
I'm not comfortable with this.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
This is not something
you can walk away from.

21:58.082 --> 22:00.032
I'm very sorry.

22:06.039 --> 22:08.173
We warned them, at least.

22:08.175 --> 22:10.175
Maybe one of them
will change their mind,

22:10.177 --> 22:11.510
tell us something later.

22:11.512 --> 22:14.430
I think maybe one of them
just did.

22:30.096 --> 22:33.098
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't
use Clyde as a paperweight.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.483
Hardly think he minds.

22:36.269 --> 22:38.537
You shouldn't refer
to it by its name.

22:38.539 --> 22:40.823
It'll just make it harder
to enjoy the soup.

22:40.825 --> 22:43.442
Take a look.

22:43.444 --> 22:46.712
I've been reviewing past
Red Team exercises.

22:46.714 --> 22:48.914
Came across that photograph
quite by accident.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.549
It's the man we met
earlier today.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.101
He introduced
himself as "Bill""

22:52.103 --> 22:54.119
but the caption lists his
name as Todd Clarke.

22:54.121 --> 22:56.922
He was a first lieutenant
when that picture was taken.

22:56.924 --> 22:59.024
Could have been captain by 2009.

22:59.026 --> 23:01.126
You think he had something to do
with the Red Team exercises?

23:01.128 --> 23:02.961
He worked at
the Army War College.

23:02.963 --> 23:05.030
He was surveilling Pontecorvo.

23:05.032 --> 23:07.650
I think we may have already
found our "Yossarian."

23:07.652 --> 23:09.601
What do you think they found?
Haven't thought about it.

23:09.603 --> 23:11.186
It's my job to find
the murderers.

23:11.188 --> 23:12.471
Yeah, but you live in New York.

23:12.473 --> 23:14.223
Their plan to attack it
was so good

23:14.225 --> 23:15.574
they made it a national secret.

23:15.576 --> 23:17.142
The world is balanced

23:17.144 --> 23:18.694
on a knife edge of destruction
every single day.

23:18.696 --> 23:20.779
You accept that, and you can
just get on with things.

23:26.786 --> 23:28.120
Sherlock Holmes?

23:28.122 --> 23:30.039
And you would be?
Curious if you know

23:30.041 --> 23:31.674
a man named
Todd Clarke.

23:31.676 --> 23:32.958
Oh, you mean Bill?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.326
We were just
talking about him.

23:34.328 --> 23:36.045
Are you in
market research, too?

23:36.047 --> 23:37.846
Sir, you did level
a series of accusations

23:37.848 --> 23:39.181
at him earlier
this afternoon.

23:39.183 --> 23:40.632
What's this about?

23:40.634 --> 23:42.034
Colonel Clarke was
shot and killed

23:42.036 --> 23:43.519
outside his home
earlier this evening.

23:43.521 --> 23:45.854
We're going to need you
to come with us.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.343
You accused Todd Clarke
of masterminding some sort

23:57.443 --> 23:59.627
of plot to kill citizens
who allegedly

23:59.681 --> 24:01.981
took part in Army war games.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.382
And by 1900 hours,

24:03.384 --> 24:04.851
he's dead.

24:04.853 --> 24:07.153
You have to admit,
the coincidence is striking.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.756
It's not striking.
It's not even a coincidence.

24:09.758 --> 24:12.525
I suspect that your
Colonel Clarke was killed

24:12.527 --> 24:15.161
by the same person who poisoned
Carlo Anillo.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.012
Question is: why?

24:17.014 --> 24:18.364
Carlo Anillo is
a private citizen.

24:18.366 --> 24:19.899
His poisoning has nothing
to do with this.

24:19.901 --> 24:21.284
Yes, so you've said.

24:21.286 --> 24:23.703
Clarke was not
a member of the Red Team,

24:23.705 --> 24:25.304
but he was Army Intelligence,

24:25.306 --> 24:27.290
and he did teach
at the War College.

24:27.292 --> 24:29.876
Which leads me to believe
that he was "Yossarian,"

24:29.878 --> 24:31.127
their liaison during
the exercise.

24:31.129 --> 24:32.528
That means that

24:32.530 --> 24:34.363
Clarke knew everything
that the Red Team did.

24:34.365 --> 24:36.499
And that makes him dangerous
in the eyes of the killer,

24:36.501 --> 24:38.668
who may or may not have been
affiliated with the government.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.253
Speaking of which,
where were you two

24:40.255 --> 24:41.587
at 1900 hours this evening?

24:41.589 --> 24:43.673
I'm sorry. Do you think
this is funny?

24:43.675 --> 24:46.208
I assure you, I find no levity
in the death of Colonel Clarke.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.844
Then why are you spouting
a bunch of nonsense

24:47.846 --> 24:49.044
about government assassinations?

24:49.046 --> 24:51.063
You know what?
We're taking you

24:51.065 --> 24:52.715
to INSCOM in Virginia
for further questioning.

24:52.717 --> 24:55.434
What about my alibi?
There are half a dozen

24:55.436 --> 24:57.219
security cameras
concealed in my home.

24:57.221 --> 25:00.022
If the two of you would be
kind enough to collect them,

25:00.024 --> 25:02.575
you'll see that I was home
at 7:00 this evening.

25:02.577 --> 25:05.828
You told me you were
getting rid of those cameras.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.330
I thought you'd be glad

25:07.332 --> 25:09.615
I'm not on my way
to a secret prison.

25:09.617 --> 25:12.251
You should have just given them
the tapes at the house.

25:12.253 --> 25:14.670
Then I would not have had
to bring them down here.

25:14.672 --> 25:16.238
We could have avoided
the whole trip.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.590
I wanted to
take the trip.

25:17.592 --> 25:19.041
I wanted them to
interrogate me

25:19.043 --> 25:20.743
so I could
counter-interrogate them.

25:20.745 --> 25:22.762
It worked. Whoever's
killing the Red Team

25:22.764 --> 25:24.764
does not work at
that field office.

25:24.766 --> 25:26.599
They thought that I
killed Todd Clarke.

25:26.601 --> 25:28.801
They obviously haven't got
a clue what's going on.

25:31.088 --> 25:34.056
No cabbie is gonna stop
if you blow a whistle at them.

25:34.058 --> 25:35.725
Cabs have been hailed this way
for decades

25:35.727 --> 25:38.277
because this is the most
efficient way to hail a cab.

25:38.279 --> 25:40.780
The murder of Todd Clarke
makes me more certain than ever

25:40.782 --> 25:42.398
that someone is killing anyone
with knowledge

25:42.400 --> 25:44.099
of the Red Team's plans.

25:44.101 --> 25:46.285
I'm just not certain
it's Army Intelligence anymore.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.790
Who else knew the names
of the Red Team?

25:50.792 --> 25:52.575
See? Not stopping.

25:52.577 --> 25:54.961
The list could have worked
its way up the chain of command.

25:54.963 --> 25:56.612
It could have leaked
to another agency.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.113
Then, of course, there's
the Red Team themselves.

25:58.115 --> 25:59.715
Why would they
pick themselves off?

25:59.717 --> 26:01.250
No obvious reason.

26:01.252 --> 26:03.502
Who are you calling?
It's time for the police

26:03.504 --> 26:06.556
to take the rest of the team
into protective custody.

26:06.558 --> 26:08.674
Taxi!

26:15.983 --> 26:18.517
Mr. McClenahan?

26:28.663 --> 26:31.247
Mr. McClenahan?

26:34.335 --> 26:36.953
Mr. McClenahan?

26:36.955 --> 26:38.671
Are you in there?

26:42.042 --> 26:43.509
Mr. McClenahan?

26:55.973 --> 26:57.807
How's Polk and Mahone?

26:57.809 --> 26:59.859
They're lucky those shells
were filled with rock salt.

26:59.861 --> 27:01.694
They're gonna be
laid up for a while,

27:01.696 --> 27:04.447
but they'll be okay.
Super, too.

27:04.449 --> 27:08.067
That contraption's not the only
weapon we found in the place.

27:09.486 --> 27:13.022
Assault rifles, knives and
a nine-millimeter pistol.

27:13.024 --> 27:15.508
Todd Clarke was
killed with a nine-millimeter.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.960
We're gonna run
a comparison ballistics test,

27:17.962 --> 27:20.496
but I'd say we found
ourselves a suspect.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.133
Holmes says he's on his way.

27:24.135 --> 27:26.035
Now, I didn't call him.

27:26.037 --> 27:28.721
Who's texting him pictures
of the crime scene?

27:28.723 --> 27:31.841
He probably called in a favor
from one of the CSU guys.

27:31.843 --> 27:33.809
I'll figure it out.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.979
We put a BOLO out
on McClenahan. Hopefully...

27:39.716 --> 27:41.067
Hopefully he hasn't
left town yet...

27:42.103 --> 27:43.402
Sorry.

27:43.404 --> 27:44.887
Says he found McClenahan.

27:44.889 --> 27:47.106
What?
Yeah.

27:47.108 --> 27:48.724
How'd you find him so fast?

27:48.726 --> 27:51.110
I didn't. I just needed
you to answer the phone.

27:51.112 --> 27:52.561
Are the others safe?

27:52.563 --> 27:54.613
Yeah. Mehta and Frost are
at the hotel already.

27:54.615 --> 27:56.732
Dresden, I guess,
has taken a while to pack,

27:56.734 --> 27:58.417
but he's got our people
with him.

27:58.419 --> 28:00.953
I'm not coming there any longer.
Don't wait for me.

28:00.955 --> 28:03.039
We're not waiting
for you.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.175
Probably be easier
to fire the guy

28:06.177 --> 28:07.793
if we ever
actually paid him.

28:14.584 --> 28:16.302
Mr. Dresden, I was
surprised to hear

28:16.304 --> 28:18.253
that you hadn't gone
to the hotel.

28:18.255 --> 28:21.357
Oh, I'm-- They said
we're okay for a bit.

28:21.359 --> 28:23.693
There isn't much we can do
quickly these days.

28:23.695 --> 28:27.396
She has
limb-onset A.L.S.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.098
Two years now.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.067
We're here because Walter
McClenahan has emerged

28:31.069 --> 28:33.486
as a suspect in the
Red Team murders.

28:35.489 --> 28:36.939
You think Walt did this?

28:36.941 --> 28:39.442
I noticed that you and
he had a certain...

28:39.444 --> 28:41.877
uh, connection; he
seemed to listen to you.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.455
Yeah, sure,
I got to know Walt.

28:53.457 --> 28:56.675
He's weird,
but he's brilliant.

28:56.677 --> 28:58.627
We stayed in touch.

28:58.629 --> 29:02.481
I guess we became... friends.

29:02.483 --> 29:04.350
I think I may be
his only friend.

29:04.352 --> 29:05.851
Then help us
find him.

29:05.853 --> 29:08.154
If he's not the killer,
he's in danger.

29:08.156 --> 29:10.489
If he is, we need
to get him into custody

29:10.491 --> 29:11.941
before he hurts anyone else.

29:11.943 --> 29:13.576
I noticed you didn't

29:13.578 --> 29:16.829
exactly howl in protest when
I mentioned he was a suspect.

29:16.831 --> 29:18.647
Without going into specifics,

29:18.649 --> 29:23.369
the plan we came up with
back in '09 was...

29:23.371 --> 29:25.421
disturbing.

29:25.423 --> 29:28.407
It's a lot to live with,

29:28.409 --> 29:30.509
and it did different things
to all of us.

29:30.511 --> 29:33.379
I got back in touch
with my brother.

29:33.381 --> 29:35.714
I started going to church again.

29:35.716 --> 29:39.251
Walt went in
a different direction.

29:39.253 --> 29:44.523
See, there are people who want
to know what we found out.

29:46.342 --> 29:48.444
Bad people.

29:48.446 --> 29:50.312
And Walt was convinced that

29:50.314 --> 29:52.114
someone was gonna
sell our secret.

29:52.116 --> 29:56.735
He used to joke that he might
as well be the one to do it.

29:56.737 --> 29:58.854
And after Nagowski got killed,

29:58.856 --> 30:01.523
Walt told me
to look on the bright side.

30:01.525 --> 30:02.875
Every time one of us dies,

30:02.877 --> 30:04.710
there are fewer people
to sell the plan.

30:04.712 --> 30:06.462
That makes it worth
more and more.

30:06.464 --> 30:09.882
I thought he was kidding.

30:09.884 --> 30:11.867
He was trying to
drive up the price.

30:11.869 --> 30:13.552
With the Red Team dead,
any potential buyer

30:13.554 --> 30:16.038
would have to come to him;
he could charge a fortune.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.557
Mm. You have an idea
where he is, don't you?

30:18.559 --> 30:22.678
Yeah. He bought some land
out in New Jersey.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.263
He built a bunker there.

30:28.152 --> 30:31.320
McClenahan may be in
a bunker in New Jersey.

30:31.322 --> 30:33.856
No, he's not.
We just found him.

30:33.858 --> 30:35.741
And he's definitely
not our killer.

30:39.412 --> 30:41.413
A homeless guy found him

30:41.415 --> 30:42.665
a little while ago.

30:42.667 --> 30:44.667
He was shot once
in the back of the head

30:44.669 --> 30:45.901
about 24 hours ago.

30:45.903 --> 30:48.621
Then the killer
dragged him over here.

30:48.623 --> 30:50.923
Left him like that.

30:50.925 --> 30:52.625
Where's your shadow, anyway?

30:52.627 --> 30:54.176
Harold Dresden's wife is sick.

30:54.178 --> 30:56.795
She's helping him
get her ready for travel.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.518
What are these
aquamarine fibers on his shirt?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.253
Oh, yeah.
The killer draped a blanket

31:04.255 --> 31:05.721
over McClenahan's face
and torso.

31:05.723 --> 31:07.606
The patrolman removed it
to check his vitals

31:07.608 --> 31:09.258
when he arrived on the scene.

31:09.260 --> 31:10.752
He covered his face?
You're sure?

31:10.777 --> 31:11.361
Mm-hmm.

31:11.362 --> 31:15.097
That's more care than he took
with any of his other victims.

31:15.099 --> 31:19.151
Suggests an element
of shame here.

31:19.153 --> 31:21.487
McClenahan was killed
by someone he knew.

31:21.489 --> 31:23.322
The guy didn't seem
like a social butterfly.

31:23.324 --> 31:25.207
He had one friend.

31:25.209 --> 31:27.626
We need to get to the hotel
where the Red Team's gathered.

31:27.628 --> 31:29.078
Why?

31:29.080 --> 31:31.330
I think the killer
may already be there.

31:35.118 --> 31:38.337
Well, it ain't much,
I know, but it's safe.

31:38.339 --> 31:41.307
Detective, any word
on whether they found Walt?

31:41.309 --> 31:43.559
I don't know how long
Sheila can stay here.

31:43.561 --> 31:46.795
Nah, I haven't heard anything
yet, but we're on the case.

31:46.797 --> 31:48.964
Are the others already here?

31:48.966 --> 31:51.100
Yeah, the department
took the whole floor.

31:52.686 --> 31:55.187
Ah, that works perfectly.
Thank you.

32:20.963 --> 32:23.398
Mr. Dresden! Freeze!

32:31.891 --> 32:33.891
Is everyone all right?

32:33.893 --> 32:36.126
We think so.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.461
After you called in
the warning,

32:37.463 --> 32:38.896
one of our guys
interrupted Dresden

32:38.898 --> 32:40.964
just as he was about
to shoot Veena Mehta.

32:40.966 --> 32:43.067
We got the rest
of the Red Team out,

32:43.069 --> 32:44.968
but he nabbed
one of our detectives.

32:44.970 --> 32:47.638
Holding him hostage
in the room.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.657
If Harold Dresden intended
to sell the Red Team's plans,

32:49.659 --> 32:51.158
the motive
would be money.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.327
He planned to kill the
other two team members

32:53.329 --> 32:55.362
in a hotel full
of policemen?

32:55.364 --> 32:57.364
That's not something one
typically walks away from.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.166
Doesn't sound like he plans
to go anywhere.

32:59.168 --> 33:00.668
Our negotiator called
the room phone.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.002
Dresden gave us his demands.

33:02.004 --> 33:04.088
Usually a guy wants a helicopter
or a bus.

33:04.090 --> 33:05.506
He just wants the rest

33:05.508 --> 33:07.324
of the surviving Red Team
delivered to him.

33:07.326 --> 33:08.626
Then he'll let our guy out.

33:08.628 --> 33:09.927
He's on a
suicide mission.

33:09.929 --> 33:10.893
I need to speak with him.

33:10.894 --> 33:13.412
That guy is holed up in there
with one of my detectives.

33:13.414 --> 33:17.566
I'm not putting this in the
hands of a suspended consultant.

33:17.568 --> 33:19.418
Captain, I know why Dresden
is doing this,

33:19.420 --> 33:21.587
and I know what to say
to make him stop.

33:21.589 --> 33:22.955
I understand
what's at stake here.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.540
I'll get your man out safely.

33:42.108 --> 33:43.559
Are they here?

33:43.561 --> 33:45.227
I think not.

33:45.229 --> 33:46.762
Why are <i>you</i> calling?

33:46.764 --> 33:48.781
Can you keep a secret,
Mr. Dresden?

33:48.783 --> 33:50.932
Most people say yes
when you ask them that,

33:50.934 --> 33:54.403
but all they really want is
for you to give them the dish.

33:54.405 --> 33:57.439
In your case, though, I'd say
that you'd earned the right

33:57.441 --> 33:58.707
to answer in the affirmative.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.442
I have no idea
what this is about,

34:00.444 --> 34:02.127
but I already told
the police what I want.

34:02.129 --> 34:04.546
Bring me Veena and Frost.

34:04.548 --> 34:05.998
Or I shoot this detective.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.949
I think we both know
that you won't do that.

34:08.952 --> 34:11.085
Just as we both know
the only person

34:11.088 --> 34:13.005
presently in that room
that you intend to harm

34:13.007 --> 34:14.907
is yourself, Mr. Dresden.

34:14.909 --> 34:16.891
How could you
possibly know that?

34:16.893 --> 34:19.143
Let me in. Let's talk about it.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.650
If you hear what I've got to say
and you're still in the mood

34:24.652 --> 34:28.654
for violence, then I'll
leave you to your standoff.

34:30.357 --> 34:33.442
I'm quite unarmed.

34:43.335 --> 34:45.120
That's better.

34:45.121 --> 34:48.623
I prefer a face-to-face,
don't you?

34:48.626 --> 34:50.208
Mind if I get something
from the minibar?

34:50.210 --> 34:52.428
NYPD's buying.

34:59.804 --> 35:03.338
Uh, my sober companion
couldn't make the trip up here.

35:04.859 --> 35:07.393
But I suppose I should forgo
alcohol all the same.

35:07.395 --> 35:09.111
You said you wanted
to talk.

35:09.113 --> 35:10.562
So sit down and talk.

35:17.537 --> 35:20.489
I judge people
by their behavior.

35:20.491 --> 35:22.374
And your behavior can only lead
to one conclusion.

35:22.376 --> 35:24.159
You're clearly not interested
in profit.

35:24.161 --> 35:27.212
You just want to be certain
that no one learns the plan

35:27.214 --> 35:29.197
the six of you
came up with.

35:29.199 --> 35:31.400
You're convinced
it's gonna get out.

35:31.402 --> 35:33.152
And that when it's enacted,
thousands,

35:33.154 --> 35:36.839
maybe hundreds of thousands
of deaths will result.

35:36.841 --> 35:40.876
But if everyone who knows
the plan is dead or stripped

35:40.878 --> 35:43.178
of their memory,
that can never happen.

35:43.180 --> 35:45.514
The math's really
quite straightforward.

35:45.516 --> 35:47.616
Six of you,
plus your Army contact--

35:47.618 --> 35:49.718
seven lives versus thousands.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.521
You worked slowly at first, you
disguised what you were doing.

35:52.523 --> 35:55.908
Then I start asking questions,
you have to speed things up.

35:55.910 --> 35:59.862
Fortunately, for you, after
Todd Clarke was murdered,

35:59.864 --> 36:03.916
we brought all of your remaining
targets to this hotel.

36:03.918 --> 36:06.251
One thing I can't
work out, though,

36:06.253 --> 36:09.788
is why you became so certain
the plan would leak.

36:09.790 --> 36:13.509
You didn't start killing
for two years

36:13.511 --> 36:15.144
after the war game.

36:18.348 --> 36:20.966
Two years ago...

36:23.353 --> 36:26.889
That's when Sheila

36:26.891 --> 36:30.809
woke up one morning and
told me she felt this

36:30.811 --> 36:33.612
twitching in her hand.

36:33.614 --> 36:35.981
You know much about
the progression of A.L.S.?

36:35.983 --> 36:38.150
You lose about two percent
of your body's functions

36:38.152 --> 36:40.219
every month.

36:40.221 --> 36:41.320
Two years in,

36:41.322 --> 36:43.622
all I can do is

36:43.624 --> 36:46.291
try to keep her
from getting bed sores.

36:48.094 --> 36:50.629
I'd been approached before
about selling our plan.

36:50.631 --> 36:53.549
I think we all had
cryptic e-mails,

36:53.551 --> 36:56.668
strangers coming up
to you in the subway.

36:56.670 --> 36:59.221
Who'd they represent?

36:59.223 --> 37:00.589
They never said.

37:00.591 --> 37:04.309
One of them did say
he could help Sheila

37:04.311 --> 37:06.228
if I talked to him.

37:06.230 --> 37:07.780
It was two years ago.

37:07.782 --> 37:10.566
Yeah, right when
she first got sick.

37:12.385 --> 37:14.736
I knew he was lying, of course.

37:14.738 --> 37:16.905
But even so, I spent days

37:16.907 --> 37:19.691
thinking about it.

37:19.693 --> 37:23.278
If he'd been able
to do a thing for her,

37:23.280 --> 37:26.331
I'd have told them
everything I know.

37:29.786 --> 37:33.872
See, everyone's got
that one thing, don't they?

37:33.874 --> 37:37.342
Some weakness that could
lead you to betray

37:37.344 --> 37:39.678
every principle
you ever had.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.881
The thing we created had value.

37:42.883 --> 37:45.050
And I realized it was
only a matter of time

37:45.052 --> 37:46.718
until someone
put a price on it.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.221
So you made arrangements
for your wife's care.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.023
Got down to business.

37:51.025 --> 37:55.027
So, you figured out my plan--
congratulations.

37:55.029 --> 37:57.529
And thank you
for helping me enact it.

37:57.531 --> 38:00.482
When I only had one policeman
in here, I had no leverage.

38:00.484 --> 38:03.318
Now, once I shoot you,
they'll realize

38:03.320 --> 38:05.186
I'm serious about
killing that detective.

38:05.188 --> 38:07.522
They'll give me
what I want.

38:07.524 --> 38:10.626
Eight lives versus thousands.

38:10.628 --> 38:12.878
Math still works.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.013
I'm amazed you still
haven't worked it out.

38:15.015 --> 38:17.716
There really is no such
thing as a secret.

38:17.718 --> 38:19.635
The plan,

38:19.637 --> 38:21.203
it's in a memo.

38:21.205 --> 38:22.921
It's been e-mailed
back and forth.

38:22.923 --> 38:25.040
It was labeled "For eyes only."

38:25.042 --> 38:28.143
No one but the White House
Situation Room has access to it.

38:28.145 --> 38:29.728
I know what it is.
You do not!

38:29.730 --> 38:31.212
I do.

38:31.214 --> 38:33.381
I worked it out
hours after taking the case.

38:33.383 --> 38:37.236
And before you pull that
trigger, you should know,

38:37.238 --> 38:39.922
I told a colleague.

38:39.924 --> 38:42.074
I wrote it down.

38:43.443 --> 38:46.995
Your secret is out.

38:48.665 --> 38:51.166
If you're telling the truth...

38:52.752 --> 38:54.953
...that's checkmate.

38:56.706 --> 38:58.607
So...

39:01.795 --> 39:03.879
What's the plan?

39:13.273 --> 39:15.691
Don't move!
Alright, hands behind your back.

39:17.861 --> 39:19.761
Detective okay?

39:19.763 --> 39:21.647
All good!

39:21.649 --> 39:24.066
You okay?

39:24.068 --> 39:26.618
How did you get
Dresden to come out?

39:26.620 --> 39:31.156
Well, I knew the Red Team's
plan, and I told him that.

39:31.158 --> 39:33.108
How did you figure that out?

39:33.110 --> 39:34.776
I thought very quickly
and very carefully.

39:34.778 --> 39:35.961
You mean you guessed?

39:35.963 --> 39:37.663
Well... I had a notion

39:37.665 --> 39:40.082
as to the Red Team's
strategy, I just...

39:40.084 --> 39:41.633
chose the most likely one.

39:41.635 --> 39:45.170
Gun to one's head,
very powerful stimulus.

39:45.172 --> 39:48.557
Captain, I think that you and I
owe each other a conversation.

39:48.559 --> 39:52.177
I got to deal with this.

39:53.763 --> 39:57.516
There's a place called McNabb's
at 43rd and 12th.

39:57.518 --> 39:59.568
Meet me there in an hour.

40:03.272 --> 40:05.524
♪

40:12.648 --> 40:15.834
I'm not really supposed to be
spending much time in bars.

40:15.836 --> 40:17.336
Well, tonight is
not about you.

40:17.338 --> 40:19.154
If I'm gonna have
this conversation,

40:19.156 --> 40:22.507
I'm gonna have a drink
to go with it.

40:24.344 --> 40:26.345
I regret that
circumstances caused me

40:26.347 --> 40:29.931
to endanger our relationship.

40:29.933 --> 40:32.834
It was a price I was willing
to pay for revenge.

40:32.836 --> 40:35.103
As was the likelihood
of going to prison.

40:35.105 --> 40:37.889
As it turns out,
there's no revenge to be had.

40:37.891 --> 40:40.409
Given that,
it serves no one's interest

40:40.411 --> 40:42.177
for you to keep me
from my work.

40:42.179 --> 40:43.929
Who the hell are you?

40:43.931 --> 40:45.147
I beg your pardon?

40:45.149 --> 40:46.514
'Cause obviously,
you're not

40:46.516 --> 40:47.899
the person I
thought you were.

40:47.901 --> 40:49.518
I don't know how
to answer that question.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.453
You don't let anyone
into your life

40:51.455 --> 40:52.654
that's not constantly
concerned with you.

40:52.656 --> 40:54.656
What kind of
mood you're in,

40:54.658 --> 40:56.324
whether you're
getting high or not,

40:56.326 --> 40:58.960
whether you're gonna
work like an adult

40:58.962 --> 41:01.329
or throw a
temper tantrum.

41:04.700 --> 41:06.701
You know what?

41:06.703 --> 41:08.837
Most of the time,
you're worth it,

41:08.839 --> 41:11.873
because you
are special.

41:11.875 --> 41:13.642
Damned if you
don't know it.

41:13.644 --> 41:16.478
But you are.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.263
You want to
work cases?

41:18.265 --> 41:20.399
You're right.

41:20.401 --> 41:23.902
I can't say no.

41:25.938 --> 41:29.491
Don't think for a minute
that I'm ever gonna forget

41:29.493 --> 41:34.413
that you were planning to
murder someone on my watch.

41:34.415 --> 41:38.083
And don't think that I'm ever
gonna really trust you again.

41:38.085 --> 41:39.835
You don't need
to trust me to benefit

41:39.837 --> 41:41.503
from my intellect, do you?

41:41.505 --> 41:43.255
No, I don't.

41:43.257 --> 41:46.675
But I do need to get
something out of my system.

41:50.913 --> 41:53.515
Welcome back.

41:58.592 --> 42:00.593
WATSON
Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

42:00.595 --> 42:03.762
Um, how'd it go?

42:03.764 --> 42:07.566
Well, I've been reinstated.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.985
Well, you don't
sound too happy.

42:12.606 --> 42:14.823
Are you eating soup?

42:14.825 --> 42:17.392
I was hungry.

42:17.394 --> 42:20.913
Please tell me
you didn't cook Clyde.

42:25.234 --> 42:27.786
The soup is split pea.

42:27.788 --> 42:31.423
These are magnificent creatures.

42:31.425 --> 42:34.710
Clyde will likely
outlive both of us.

42:36.463 --> 42:39.581
You didn't really think
I would eat him, did you?

42:39.583 --> 42:43.519
I don't know. I guess it's hard
to know what you're gonna do.

42:43.521 --> 42:45.938
You want to tell me
what happened with Gregson?

42:48.942 --> 42:50.726
All right. Good night.
