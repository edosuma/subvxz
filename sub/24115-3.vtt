00:02.240 --> 00:03.240
Val of House El,

00:03.440 --> 00:05.591
you are hereby
sentenced to death.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.269
No!

00:07.480 --> 00:09.949
Seg, someone from the future
is coming to destroy Krypton.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.430
Take this.
You have to find the fortress.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.795
<i>Grandfather was no traitor.</i>

00:13.960 --> 00:15.553
<i>He was a hero.</i>

00:16.440 --> 00:18.830
Welcome to your grandfather's
Fortress of Solitude.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.037
Val was determined to prove
that we weren't alone

00:21.200 --> 00:22.270
in the universe.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.635
We have to finish his work.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.792
Who's your accomplice,
Charys?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.150
I love you.
It was me!

00:27.320 --> 00:28.834
No, Val!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.912
No!

00:31.080 --> 00:32.958
- Please, no, please!
- No!

00:33.120 --> 00:36.033
<i>Your parents chose chaos.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:39.272
I need to know if you intend
to follow in their footsteps.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
I don't.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.076
The blood of House El will
forever bind us.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
Hello, Seg.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.990
Grandfather.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.560
I'm a projection
of Val-El.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.234
You've still got me, Seg.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.432
We were never gonna find
a way to be together.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.592
You want me to bind
with your daughter?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.557
Okay.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.394
Even if I never get to bear
the sigil of my own house,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.631
I will not wear yours.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.280
Commander?
What is all this?

01:03.440 --> 01:05.318
The Rankless initiative.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.040
We're going down to the
Rankless to crack some skulls.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.876
You are Lyta of House Zod.
You are a warrior.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.269
Commander Quex-UI.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.592
I challenge you
to a Kandorian duel.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.832
No mercy will be shown.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
<i>Lyta-Zod.</i>

01:21.680 --> 01:25.469
I hereby appoint you Commander
of Fourth Squad, Sagitari.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.839
Here's something
you don't see every day.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.640
The meteor shower reported
in the Outlands.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.591
We're gonna check that out.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
Something crashed here.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.576
This better be
something real, Earth man.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.696
I'm getting tired of being...

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
<i>Val!</i>

01:42.640 --> 01:43.790
Grandfather!

01:48.560 --> 01:49.994
Hello, Seg.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.160
Whoa.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.513
You look super realistic
for a...

01:53.680 --> 01:54.511
Val, Adam.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.080
Adam, Val.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.239
This was found in the Outlands.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.036
- We think it's a...
- I know what it is.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.793
It's one of Brainiac's probes.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.713
He sends these things
out into the universe.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.520
It's how he determines
if a civilization's

02:06.560 --> 02:07.676
worthy of collection.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.039
- Exactly.
- We need you to run

02:09.199 --> 02:10.199
some analysis on this.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.799
See what we can find out.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.474
Well, let's take a look.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.357
Put it there.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.318
The techno-organic material
of this device

02:32.480 --> 02:33.675
is of unknown origin.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.239
But this is only a casing
for another device.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.800
- It's a shell?
- Precisely.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.074
This is used
to contain a Sentry.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.635
Once the shell is opened,

02:44.200 --> 02:45.395
the Sentry's exposed.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.040
But right now...

02:48.960 --> 02:53.079
we can extrapolate from the
interior structure of the shell

02:53.240 --> 02:57.359
the approximate size and shape
of the Sentry.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.760
Right,
I get what it looks like.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.870
But what exactly is it?

03:00.040 --> 03:01.269
It's parasitic.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.350
Once the Sentry
is out of the shell,

03:04.840 --> 03:05.840
it seeks a host.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.474
It takes over the host's body.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.391
It then uses that host
to gather information

03:11.560 --> 03:13.040
about whatever planet it's on.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.911
Defense systems, population,
vulnerabilities, etcetera.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.072
Once it's gathered
all the information required,

03:19.280 --> 03:20.714
it uploads it to Brainiac,

03:21.760 --> 03:24.514
and leaves the host body
for dead.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.920
So we need to extract this
little bastard from its shell

03:28.000 --> 03:29.936
and then deactivate it before
it goes to work, right?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.713
Easier said than done.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.914
Remember,
once we open the probe shell,

03:36.080 --> 03:37.799
the Sentry will activate

03:37.960 --> 03:40.395
and do what parasites do:

03:40.560 --> 03:41.994
seek out a host body.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.436
You do realize I'm a hologram,
don't you?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.678
Do it, Grandpa.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
Shit.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.559
It's not in there, is it?

04:20.720 --> 04:21.915
I'm afraid not.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.270
It appears the Sentry
has already been released.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.035
Oh, Mighty Rao,
before your grace,

05:20.200 --> 05:22.635
we wandered lost
in the darkness.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.833
Until you appeared and led us
into the light.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.514
Beautifully said, Ona.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.915
Thanks, uncle Kem.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.355
My pleasure.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.800
You'd better hurry up and
eat that before it eats you.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.872
- Do you want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.918
What?
Well.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.590
That is unfortunate,
because it would be a shame

05:45.760 --> 05:47.353
for this to go to waste.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.956
Rhom, don't worry, okay?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.753
I know things are
tough for everybody,

05:52.920 --> 05:56.516
but there will always be a meal
here for you and Ona.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.634
I'll pay you back soon.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
I...

06:00.480 --> 06:02.676
I'm starting a glamorous
new job tonight.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.435
Rhom, isn't it?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.632
You having trouble
with the scanner?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.075
Yeah, a little.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.510
Thank you.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.833
No problem.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.316
Your first time
working salvage?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.599
Got any advice?

06:41.760 --> 06:45.993
Just remember, it's up to you
to report what you find.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.274
Some things are worth more
on the black market

06:49.440 --> 06:51.716
than in the hands
of the guilds.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
Okay.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.595
Let's think this through.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.319
If the Sentry isn't here,

07:58.480 --> 08:00.073
it means it's found its host,
right?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.469
I believe so.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.757
And whoever that host is,

08:04.320 --> 08:06.039
I'm afraid they're
in mortal danger now.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.031
You said the Sentry's
a parasite.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.351
Maybe it takes time
to infect its host.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.989
Maybe we can find the person
before that happens.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.833
- Deactivate it.
- Perhaps.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.913
But honestly, Seg, I...
I just don't know.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.436
My research was
interrupted too soon.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.592
I'm sorry.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.798
Okay, well, we at least
have to try, right?

08:25.960 --> 08:27.360
Let's go back to the beginning.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.096
Okay, we found this thing
in the Outlands.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.240
So, who else goes out there?

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
Salvage crews.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.519
So, let's say that some poor
chump found the shell

08:34.679 --> 08:36.120
and somehow got
a hold of the Sentry.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.716
What happens then?

08:37.880 --> 08:41.191
Well, if he reports it,
it goes up to the guild.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.595
And if he doesn't?

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
Might try and sell it.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.440
Keep it for himself.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.016
Look, if we're gonna
find this thing

08:49.040 --> 08:50.456
before it completely
takes over its host,

08:50.480 --> 08:51.696
then we gotta start
working fast.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.074
You find Kem.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.256
Head over to the Labor Index.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.556
Find out if anyone in those
salvage crews saw anything.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.513
I'm gonna head up the Guilds,
find Lyta.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.120
See if anyone turned it in.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.836
Sounds good to me.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.680
Let's go.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.840
<i>Seg, wait up.</i>

09:07.440 --> 09:08.669
<i>I can't.
I'm in a hurry.</i>

09:08.840 --> 09:10.194
<i>Well, I'm sure I can keep up.</i>

09:10.400 --> 09:12.198
Nice to see you walking
amongst the Guilded.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.915
Didn't even have to send
a Sagitari to retrieve you.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.913
Some would call that progress.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.776
One of these days,
we'll work up

09:18.800 --> 09:19.836
to a family dinner.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.040
I'd like that.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.231
Hm, I really need
to teach you how to lie, Seg.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.675
I'm better with the truth.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.677
It means a lot what
you did for me, Nyssa.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.680
Allowing me the chance to give
my parents an honorable burial.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.480
Urgent military business?

09:39.280 --> 09:41.320
I just need to get my
security clearance reinstated.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.480
Better.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.558
That was almost believable.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.037
Have your secrets, Seg.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.790
I most certainly have mine.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.677
Be sure to give
my congratulations to Lyta

09:55.840 --> 09:57.115
on her new promotion.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.560
You could have been killed.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.598
I know,
but I wasn't.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.070
I don't get it.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.616
Was this to earn
your mother's respect,

10:09.640 --> 10:11.279
to... to somehow prove
that you belong?

10:11.440 --> 10:12.556
- No.
- Then why?

10:12.720 --> 10:14.712
Why would you risk your life
like that?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.036
I don't have time for this.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.759
And you shouldn't even be here.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Lyta.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.075
You killed someone.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.080
I challenged Quex
to change things.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.755
To change the way the Sagitari
treat the Rankless.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.712
Then I guess
I should be thanking you.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.279
I appreciate you
checking in on me.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.357
If I'm being honest,

10:40.520 --> 10:42.193
it's not the only
reason I'm here.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.976
I need your help tracking
down any reports

10:44.000 --> 10:47.835
of anything unusual
or suspicious being turned in

10:48.040 --> 10:49.040
to the Guild.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.840
There's something
we need to find.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
What is it?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.917
I found it in the Outlands.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.276
Never seen anything
like it before.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.079
Give you 200 solars.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.919
200?
No.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.470
It must be worth
more than that.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.200
Not to me.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.874
Oh, fine.
Deal.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.520
Pleasure doing business.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
Let's go.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.435
Black Zero has already made
one attempt on my life.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.031
Can you assure me this
Rankless Initiative

11:47.200 --> 11:49.351
will mean it's the last?

11:49.560 --> 11:51.313
When the sun rises tomorrow,

11:51.520 --> 11:53.557
Black Zero and
their sympathizers

11:53.720 --> 11:55.234
shall be brought to justice.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.115
I hope so,

11:57.280 --> 11:59.033
because if this
initiative fails

11:59.200 --> 12:01.760
and they are not made
to suffer the consequences

12:01.960 --> 12:02.960
of their actions,

12:03.240 --> 12:06.119
then perhaps you should be.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.474
Keep me apprised
of the progress.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.880
Of course,
Your Eminence.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.359
The Sagitari will be
comforted to know

12:25.520 --> 12:28.274
the Voice has taken such
interest in the operation.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.840
I do not care
for their comfort.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.793
Only that they succeed.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.392
Black Zero's
leadership hierarchy.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.995
We still don't have
any substantiated images

12:49.200 --> 12:51.431
of Jax-Ur,
but you should all be familiar

12:51.600 --> 12:53.751
with most of these other faces
by now.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.990
Not this one.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.277
- Who's he?
- Unknown.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.716
Intelligence suggests
he's a relatively new player.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.879
Seems to be rising up through
the ranks very quickly.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.952
We've detected a high
concentration

13:05.120 --> 13:08.158
of Black Zero activity which
suggests they have a stronghold

13:08.320 --> 13:09.754
somewhere in this area.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.999
Sector 19.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.879
The council have authorized us
to seal off the entire area,

13:21.120 --> 13:24.670
to go street by street
and root out their operatives.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.670
Their leaders are
our primary targets.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.356
Brief your squads.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.160
We are a go at 4300 hours.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.190
There are thousands
of innocent citizens

13:36.360 --> 13:37.656
- in this sector.
- If they give refuge

13:37.680 --> 13:40.559
to enemies of Kandor,
how innocent can they be?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.440
They know more about the area
than our satellites ever will.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.749
If we take our time to get
to know these people

13:47.080 --> 13:49.231
rather than uprooting them
from their homes,

13:49.400 --> 13:51.471
they will be more willing
to give us information

13:51.680 --> 13:53.096
- about Black Zero.
- If the Rankless choose not

13:53.120 --> 13:56.750
to divulge what they know about
these terrorists,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.389
then they will pay a price
for their silence.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.358
Now, if there are
no more questions...

14:19.080 --> 14:20.296
Nothing unusual reported
to the Guilds.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.073
Any luck with the salvagers?

14:22.240 --> 14:24.800
Do you know how hard it is to
ask someone if they've found

14:24.960 --> 14:26.896
any alien technology without
actually asking them,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.071
"Hey, have you found
any alien technology?"

14:29.720 --> 14:30.995
I'm sure you found a way.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.751
They're the only ones
out there.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.016
They had to have
seen something.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.635
Sure, um,
rusted-out skimmers,

14:36.920 --> 14:38.240
a half-eaten ice wraith,

14:38.400 --> 14:41.040
the carcass of the much bigger,
much scarier thing

14:41.200 --> 14:42.554
that ate the ice wraith.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.677
But listen, don't worry.
I'm sure that our friend

14:44.840 --> 14:47.435
from a distant galaxy has got
it all figured out.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
Kem.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
Lyta.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.120
You just couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.556
I killed a man for the right
to open it.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.720
I deserve to be heard.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.234
You know what I mean.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.749
We both know
who lives in Sector 19.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.429
Seg's not Black Zero,
and neither were his parents.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.593
Their actions at the Tribunal
suggest otherwise.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.872
And I'm sure they had friends
who were Black Zero

15:13.040 --> 15:15.157
who are still
among the Rankless.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.717
Any forewarning puts
every Sagitari in danger.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.198
Your squad needs to know
they can trust you.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.277
Remember, the higher you rise,

15:28.440 --> 15:31.672
the more eyes are eager
to watch you fall.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
This is your locker now.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.636
Dev, I know how much
you cared about Quex.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.912
I care about you, too.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.750
I'm sorry.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.032
Look,
you did what you had to do.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.673
I keep telling myself that.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.994
It's natural to have doubts,
Lyta.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.671
About what you've done,
what you're about to do.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.594
But if you let
your squad see them,

16:24.960 --> 16:26.872
they'll begin
to have doubts about you.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.034
If we go through with this,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.920
I believe we will create more
terrorists than we'll stop.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.276
What do you mean,
"if" we go through with it?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.358
We have our orders.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.239
- But we can't...
- We don't choose

16:40.400 --> 16:42.073
which orders we follow.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.233
I shouldn't have to tell
a Commander that.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.515
- All right.
- Hey, uh, I'm...

17:06.280 --> 17:07.919
I'm looking for something...

17:09.280 --> 17:10.873
a little unusual.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.196
Just...

17:13.359 --> 17:14.555
H'Rakan egg sac.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.398
Very unusual.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.960
And delicious.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.351
No, I think maybe something
a little less unusual.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.672
Maybe something, uh,
more shiny.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.713
I recently acquired
a Daxamite hunting blade.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.030
No.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.515
What about...

17:33.680 --> 17:34.909
Mithenite gemstones?

17:35.080 --> 17:37.515
No, I'm looking
for something...

17:44.120 --> 17:47.591
Maybe, uh, that.
Right there, yeah.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.033
Yeah, how much?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.475
One of the few
remaining relics

17:57.640 --> 17:58.790
of the legendary Tenth City?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.400
Listen, from one bullshitter
to another,

18:02.480 --> 18:03.640
we both know that's not true.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.512
20,000 solars.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.716
Come on, man.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.436
Look, the guy over there
sells them for half that.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.478
I didn't wanna say it, but, uh,

18:13.440 --> 18:14.794
he says yours are fake.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.560
<i>Attention!</i>

18:27.400 --> 18:30.950
Listen up, because I'm only
going to say this once.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.159
The Rankless are not our enemy.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.394
This Initiative is about
targeting Black Zero

18:37.560 --> 18:39.233
and Black Zero only.

18:40.360 --> 18:44.479
They have killed citizens
of Kandor, the Guilded,

18:44.680 --> 18:46.399
and Rankless alike.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.030
It is our job to stop them
from killing more.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.359
And it will be done
with honor and respect.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.638
And without a single shot fired

19:00.800 --> 19:02.837
on innocent people.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.474
Mark my words.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.797
There will be no cracking
of heads or thinning the herd.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.670
Nobody fires unless
I give the order.

19:14.880 --> 19:15.518
Understood?

19:15.680 --> 19:17.353
Yes, Commander.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.672
The ability to divorce
oneself from emotion

19:27.840 --> 19:32.517
is what separates a successful
mission from failure.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.991
And we do not fail.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.556
May Rao's grace be your shield.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.630
And light the way
to victory.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.233
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.520
Did you
did he just shush me?

19:57.640 --> 19:58.640
In your own tavern.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.000
Did anyone follow me in here?

20:03.440 --> 20:04.794
I don't see anyone, no.
Why?

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
What did you do?

20:08.320 --> 20:09.879
What superheroes do.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.000
Is this what I think it is?

20:19.400 --> 20:21.039
Well, it ain't a hot dog.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.593
Yes, it's the Sentry.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.195
And it looks to me like
it hasn't activated yet.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.119
Eh?
Fist bump.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.838
No?
Is that a thing here?

20:33.040 --> 20:34.918
Look, will you just get out
from behind my bar?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.896
And you're paying
for that drink, by the way.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.400
Hey, focus.
Fate of the world.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.976
Let's get this thing
back to the Fortress

20:41.000 --> 20:42.957
and make sure
it never finds a host.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.312
I don't understand you!

20:46.680 --> 20:48.399
And you owe me
for that drink!

20:48.760 --> 20:49.760
Idiot.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.913
So, we get Val to make
absolutely certain

20:52.080 --> 20:53.719
that it hasn't been activated.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.196
Then, all we have to do
is figure out

20:56.400 --> 20:57.834
how to destroy that thing.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.296
Well, maybe there's a way
to reverse engineer it.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.437
We can figure out
how far away Brainiac is.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.271
- You can do that?
- Maybe.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.560
With Val's help.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.073
<i>Attention,
Rankless citizens.</i>

21:12.240 --> 21:14.436
<i>This quadrant is
being evacuated.</i>

21:14.600 --> 21:17.479
<i>Sector 19 residents
are hereby evicted.</i>

21:17.760 --> 21:20.150
<i>Prepare to be scanned
and processed.</i>

21:27.000 --> 21:28.559
<i>Attention,
Rankless citizens.</i>

21:28.760 --> 21:30.911
<i>This quadrant
is being evacuated.</i>

21:31.080 --> 21:34.152
<i>Sector 19 residents
are hereby evicted.</i>

21:34.320 --> 21:36.630
<i>Prepare to be scanned
and processed.</i>

21:41.480 --> 21:42.675
On the ground!

21:42.840 --> 21:44.320
Sect off the perimeter.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.632
<i>Attention,
Rankless citizens...</i>

21:47.440 --> 21:48.635
- Aah!
- Hurry it up.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.039
<i>Prepare to be
scanned and processed.</i>

22:00.480 --> 22:01.960
<i>Attention,
Rankless citizens...</i>

22:04.520 --> 22:07.638
<i>Sector 19 residents
are hereby evicted.</i>

22:07.840 --> 22:09.877
<i>Prepare to be
scanned and processed.</i>

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
Back up!

22:17.160 --> 22:18.719
<i>Attention,
Rankless citizens.</i>

22:18.880 --> 22:21.475
<i>This quadrant
is being evacuated.</i>

22:21.640 --> 22:24.314
<i>Sector 19 residents
are hereby evicted.</i>

22:33.280 --> 22:34.396
You, over here!

22:35.800 --> 22:37.837
<i>All adults older
than 15 cycles...</i>

22:38.040 --> 22:39.633
- Come here right now.
- Stop!

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
Another one.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.176
Turn your face
toward the scanner.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.916
No sudden movements!

22:50.080 --> 22:52.675
<i>All Rankless citizens will
evacuate their homes.</i>

22:52.840 --> 22:55.230
This one's fine.
Move to sector three.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.959
Hey, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.873
Listen to me.
Take this.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.936
We can't risk it falling into
Sagitari hands, all right?

23:00.960 --> 23:03.096
Get it back to the Fortress
and start working with Val.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.395
How am I supposed
to do that?

23:04.560 --> 23:05.630
Look around you, Seg.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
I don't know.
Find a way.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.520
No, hey, hey!

23:08.680 --> 23:09.736
Where do you think
you're going?

23:09.760 --> 23:10.830
To talk to Lyta.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.349
Adam, go!

23:13.280 --> 23:15.192
Please remain calm!

23:15.360 --> 23:17.397
I want squads three and eight
to secure this area.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.279
Once that's done,
move onto the next one.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.272
Is this your idea
of changing things?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.559
I am trying, but we cannot
ignore the intelligence

23:27.720 --> 23:30.280
that Black Zero's operated
out of this area.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.393
Do they look like Black Zero
to you?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.791
This was going to happen
with or without me.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.237
I am doing my best to make it
as safe as possible.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.240
How long have you known
about this?

23:41.480 --> 23:43.039
You chose not to tell me.

23:43.200 --> 23:43.917
You didn't trust me.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.240
I can't talk to you
right now.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.354
Get out of here, Seg.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.440
Go.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.676
Report to
the southern checkpoint.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.117
Come on, I'm dying here,
man.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.081
How long does it take to figure
out if it infected anyone?

24:05.200 --> 24:06.856
Well, if you believe there's
a more efficient method,

24:06.880 --> 24:07.996
you're welcome to try.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.155
No, all good here.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.440
But when you're done there,
I got something else

24:13.520 --> 24:14.556
for you to look at.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.277
It's called a Zeta-Beam Device.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.318
I know,
came up with it myself.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.916
Anyway, it's kind of the horse
I rode in on.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.320
Only she won't
giddy up anymore,

24:25.520 --> 24:27.000
and she's my return trip home.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.514
So, I'd kinda like to get

24:30.280 --> 24:31.794
Uh, that's not good,
is it?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.797
Who else has the Sentry
been in contact with?

24:39.400 --> 24:41.392
Kem?
Kem, are you here?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.199
<i>Seg, we kinda got
a big problem here.</i>

24:44.480 --> 24:45.480
What is it?

24:45.680 --> 24:47.353
I'll let Val explain.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.159
An analysis in the Sentry
shows it to be inactive.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.875
Great, why is that a problem?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.951
Because it means the Sentry's
already found a host.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.756
- Let's go.
- Hey... pig.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.191
Rhom?

25:05.360 --> 25:07.272
- Ah.
- Rhom, Ona?

25:07.760 --> 25:08.760
Why are they doing this?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.720
I don't know, but just come
with me, all right?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.554
- Everything hurts.
- Everything will be fine.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.720
Just trust me.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.720
Mama...

25:19.880 --> 25:21.360
Did the Sagitari hurt her?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.318
No,
she's been sick all day.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.153
Mama, are you okay?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.992
We're scanning this area.
Get out.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.117
No, she needs a doctor.
She needs a doctor.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.536
Children to
the southeastern sector.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.880
- She needs a doctor!
- Mom!

25:43.040 --> 25:44.918
No, don't touch her!

25:45.080 --> 25:46.080
Please, don't hurt her!

25:46.120 --> 25:47.952
- Ona!
- I want my mom!

25:49.280 --> 25:50.280
Where are you taking me?

25:50.360 --> 25:51.635
Get to the checkpoint.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.920
Move, now.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Okay.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
Up, Rankless.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.398
We're evacuating this entire area.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
We need you out.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.511
Hey!

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
Hey!

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
Aah!

26:21.680 --> 26:22.750
We need to go.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.673
We need to go, come on.
Ona, come on.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
Let's go, let's go.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.720
Over here, Rankless.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.870
What are you doing here?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.472
In here.
In here.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.556
Seg's on his way.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.040
We'll figure this out.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.496
You're safe in here, okay?
Don't worry.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.874
I don't understand.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
What's happening?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.236
Why did my mom do that?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.710
Are you guys all right?

27:02.840 --> 27:03.840
Mmhmm.

27:03.880 --> 27:04.880
Yeah, we're fine.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.756
- But Rhom.
- She hurt those men.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.757
I think...
I think she...

27:11.280 --> 27:13.351
It's not her fault.
It's not her fault.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.990
She's sick.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.197
Whatever she did,
whatever happened,

27:17.400 --> 27:18.880
it's because of the sickness.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.360
Understand?

27:20.520 --> 27:21.840
It's not her fault.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.036
It's not her.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.150
You can help her though,
right?

27:30.600 --> 27:34.753
Why don't you
tuck into these,

27:36.440 --> 27:39.399
and we're gonna figure it out,
okay?

27:40.400 --> 27:42.073
Please help her.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.072
We're gonna do
everything we can.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.277
I thought we'd found
the Sentry in time.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.755
What happened?

27:57.920 --> 27:58.956
We were too late.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.115
It was dormant because
it had already found its host.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
In Rhom.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.120
I knew
she was doing it tough,

28:06.240 --> 28:08.960
but I... I had no idea that
she was working salvage

28:09.160 --> 28:10.160
in the Outlands.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.636
I just don't understand
why she didn't tell us.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.836
We could have helped.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.039
She was probably
too embarrassed.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.556
Do you, um...

28:25.080 --> 28:26.992
do you think we can save her?

28:27.920 --> 28:28.920
I dunno.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.270
But if there's a way,
I'm gonna find it.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.240
Did you see which way she went?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.034
Towards the market,
I think.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.396
I don't know.
It all happened so quickly.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.671
Okay.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.876
Hey, hey.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
Be careful.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.795
Seg, you... you haven't seen
what she can do.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.553
Just take care of the kid.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.038
All squads,
lock down your sectors

29:00.200 --> 29:01.200
and form your lines.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.879
All squads,
lock down your sectors

29:03.040 --> 29:04.918
and form your lines.
Now.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.436
Do you think we're going
to let this go unpunished?

29:13.320 --> 29:15.789
You think
we can't make you talk?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.674
You think you can protect
the bastards that did this?

29:31.320 --> 29:34.279
Tell us where
Black Zero's hiding.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.750
I don't know.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.398
I didn't see anything.

29:43.640 --> 29:44.640
How about now?

29:45.120 --> 29:46.120
This jog your memory?

29:46.240 --> 29:48.311
I can't breathe.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.517
If you can talk,
you can breathe.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.176
Got no right to be here.
You've got no right!

29:52.200 --> 29:53.680
He's not Black Zero.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.194
Now tell me where
Black Zero is.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.396
Let him go!

29:57.200 --> 29:59.271
Shut your mouth, Rankless!

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
Let him go!

30:13.400 --> 30:14.914
Back off!

30:16.800 --> 30:18.075
You murderer!

30:22.720 --> 30:25.110
Quadrants one, two, and three
have been swept,

30:25.280 --> 30:27.192
cleared, and secured.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.440
And?

30:28.480 --> 30:30.995
And we've yet to locate
the Black Zero stronghold,

30:31.160 --> 30:33.231
but there's only one quadrant
left to lock down.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.800
Why the delay?

30:35.640 --> 30:37.916
There's been a situation
with the Rankless.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.631
Move!
Back up!

30:44.160 --> 30:44.991
Killers!

30:45.160 --> 30:46.160
Step back!

30:49.560 --> 30:51.074
Weapons down!

30:52.280 --> 30:53.999
Weapons down, now!

30:54.600 --> 30:55.716
That is an order!

31:00.200 --> 31:01.200
What happened here?

31:01.320 --> 31:02.151
She killed an innocent man!

31:02.320 --> 31:03.151
She murdered him.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.674
It was self defense.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.155
I had no choice.

31:06.320 --> 31:10.155
So you, a Sagitari,
felt threatened

31:10.720 --> 31:12.518
by an unarmed man in shackles?

31:12.720 --> 31:15.155
He was coming to the aid
of a Black Zero sympathizer.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.800
- That's not possible.
- That's a lie.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.920
She's lying.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
Probably one himself.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.360
Probably?

31:20.640 --> 31:21.960
So you admit you weren't sure?

31:24.880 --> 31:25.880
Kol-Da.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.676
You are under arrest
for the unlawful death

31:28.840 --> 31:30.240
of a Rankless citizen.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.520
For defending myself
against a terrorist?

31:33.640 --> 31:35.677
You will get your chance
to plead your innocence

31:35.840 --> 31:37.513
before the Tribunal.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.559
A chance you denied this man.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.474
- Justice!
- Calm down.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.913
And unless you would all
like to join her,

31:48.080 --> 31:50.515
I suggest you disperse
and proceed

31:50.720 --> 31:53.440
to the nearest checkpoint now!

31:58.840 --> 32:00.354
I can't find
any sign of Rhom.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.096
Do you have any idea where
she would have been headed?

32:03.120 --> 32:04.600
<i>Wherever will allow it
to upload</i>

32:04.760 --> 32:06.592
information on Kandor
to Brainiac.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.830
Might try
a communications center.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.317
Listen, you have to destroy
that thing before...

32:12.480 --> 32:14.517
It's not a thing or an it
we're dealing with.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
Rhom's my friend.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.436
<i>Not anymore.</i>

32:18.600 --> 32:20.717
She's been taken over
by Brainiac's technology.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.416
What if we can find a way
to disable it?

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
<i>Even if we could,</i>

32:23.560 --> 32:24.760
how would you get close enough

32:24.960 --> 32:26.320
and not end up
like those soldiers?

32:27.320 --> 32:29.073
<i>I know you wanna save
your friend, Seg.</i>

32:29.640 --> 32:31.438
<i>But there's a lot more lives
at stake.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:33.316
You heard what Val said.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.992
<i>Brainiac's Sentry has one goal
and one goal only.</i>

32:43.160 --> 32:45.038
<i>To gather all the information
Brainiac needs</i>

32:45.200 --> 32:46.759
<i>to lay this planet to waste.</i>

32:48.960 --> 32:50.633
<i>I want you
to think about that.</i>

32:51.280 --> 32:53.317
<i>Anyone that you have ever
known or loved.</i>

32:55.040 --> 32:57.191
Whoever she once was to you
is gone.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.552
<i>She's Brainiac's agent now.</i>

33:09.400 --> 33:11.073
I can't sneak away for long,
Seg.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
What is it?

33:12.320 --> 33:13.071
You owe me.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.311
I need an electrostatic
discharge grenade.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.896
But it only works
on electronics, right?

33:16.920 --> 33:17.717
It's not gonna kill anyone?

33:17.880 --> 33:19.280
Well,
what do you want it for?

33:21.720 --> 33:23.040
What's really going on?

33:24.880 --> 33:26.030
Three of my squad are dead,

33:26.200 --> 33:28.440
and now there are reports of
a communications hub breach,

33:28.520 --> 33:30.079
and you come asking for an ESD,

33:30.240 --> 33:31.976
and I'm not supposed to think
that's connected?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.878
If you are covering
for Black Zero...

33:34.040 --> 33:35.110
Not Black Zero.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.029
Then who is it?

33:37.320 --> 33:39.391
Some pissed off Rankless
out for revenge?

33:39.560 --> 33:40.560
It's a friend.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.430
It's a friend.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.633
Okay?
And she's not herself.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.156
But I can stop her.
That's why I need the ESD.

33:48.320 --> 33:52.360
You are asking me to
hand over military ordinance.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.433
I'm gonna need
a little more than that.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.176
If I thought there was
any other way to do this,

33:56.200 --> 33:57.200
I wouldn't be here.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.357
But I have nowhere else to go.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.991
I am asking you, Lyta,

34:02.160 --> 34:03.674
to trust me this time.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.957
I have dead Sagitari.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.856
You're gonna have a lot more
if you send them inside

34:07.880 --> 34:08.916
that communications hub.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.234
Do you trust me?

34:18.880 --> 34:19.880
Yes.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.670
Be careful.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.839
Commander Zod, we have
possible Black Zero activity

34:36.000 --> 34:37.514
in the communications hub.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.712
Why is your squad
holding their position?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.349
We're still assessing the
nature of the threat, Primus.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.193
<i>It's not your job to assess,
Commander.</i>

34:44.360 --> 34:45.429
It's to neutralize.

34:45.639 --> 34:46.437
<i>I understand that.</i>

34:46.639 --> 34:48.518
Then order your squad
to move in at once.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.668
Negative, Primus.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.710
Not until I can ensure
the safety of my troops.

34:55.880 --> 35:00.397
Lyta, you are disobeying
a direct order.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.997
I hope you know
what you're doing, Seg.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.280
Rhom?

35:36.240 --> 35:37.515
Rhom, it's me, Seg.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
I can help you.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.152
There is no Rhom.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.072
Rhom has been collected.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.039
Krypton is worthy
of collection.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.396
You will be collected.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.354
I am transcendent.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.952
Free of the material universe
and the limitations

36:11.120 --> 36:13.271
of physical existence.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.712
Rhom... it's me.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.150
I'm your friend.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.352
I know you're in there
somewhere.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.230
There is nothing to fight.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.039
This is a gift.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.118
My faculties of cognition
are beyond

36:28.280 --> 36:30.749
any living being's
comprehension.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.360
Fight it, Rhom.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.113
Fight for your daughter.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.480
Fight for Ona.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.954
Ona loves you.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.592
And there isn't anything
you wouldn't do for her.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.479
I need you
to come back for her.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.116
Fight this, Rhom.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.834
I need you to help me.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.554
Primus,
we're breaching the hub.

37:41.800 --> 37:42.800
Clear left.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
Clear right.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.116
<i>Commander Em,
situation report.</i>

37:49.840 --> 37:51.479
Primus, it looks like
they tried to hack

37:51.640 --> 37:53.711
into the electro-communications
grid.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.276
No Black Zero operatives
in sight.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.435
But no sign of
any Black Zero operatives.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.874
What happened to her?

38:28.600 --> 38:29.920
Is she still alive?

38:30.640 --> 38:31.640
Barely.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.360
Seg, what's going on?

38:37.760 --> 38:39.513
My grandfather was right.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.477
We're not alone
in the universe.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.440
There's something out there.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.593
It found her,
and it's coming for us.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.437
Whoa!
Whoa.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.270
It's okay.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.751
He's... an acquaintance.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.736
The skimmer's close,
but we should hustle

39:04.760 --> 39:06.160
before these lights
turn back on.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.320
Seg, if what
you're saying is true,

39:08.440 --> 39:10.557
then the Council
need to see her.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.229
We can make them believe.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
I can't.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.113
I have to save her.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.237
Lyta,
thank you for trusting me.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.800
Yes.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.590
The only arrest made
in the Rankless Initiative.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.032
One of our own Sagitari.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
Father?

40:03.800 --> 40:05.837
What are you going to tell
the Voice of Rao?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.480
The only thing I can.

40:11.120 --> 40:11.792
The truth.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.429
Are you sure the truth
is the best option right now?

40:14.640 --> 40:15.640
What's the alternative?

40:16.880 --> 40:18.917
Black Zero continue
to exist unabated,

40:19.080 --> 40:20.080
and now...

40:21.560 --> 40:22.789
The mission is a failure.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.480
Is she going to live?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.554
It's difficult to say.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.396
Whatever Brainiac did,
it appears to be

40:55.560 --> 40:57.153
keeping her alive.

40:58.600 --> 41:02.640
My concern is that,
in trying to reverse it,

41:02.800 --> 41:03.800
we risk losing her.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.216
Well,
at least you stopped her

41:06.240 --> 41:07.594
before she got to a transmitter

41:07.760 --> 41:09.672
and uploaded whatever info
she accessed.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.435
I don't believe
that was her intention.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
What do you mean?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.439
I believe
she is the transmitter.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.434
We gotta stop her before
she sends a signal to Brainiac.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.755
It's too late.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.760
It's already been sent.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.112
Krypton,

41:41.280 --> 41:46.912
your world is at an end.
