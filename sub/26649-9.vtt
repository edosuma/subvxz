WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.700 --> 00:14.067
Let this motherfuckin' party
begin!

00:14.133 --> 00:17.600
This time,
we are back where we belong.

00:17.667 --> 00:20.667
Newcastle!
With our friends.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.067
And family.
Yoo-hoo!

00:25.133 --> 00:26.867
Nana!

00:26.933 --> 00:28.467
Doing the things we love.

00:31.433 --> 00:34.400
There'll be some new faces.
Hello!

00:34.467 --> 00:38.767
Plenty of old faces.
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

00:38.833 --> 00:41.333
And one big blast from the past.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.000
Long time no fucking see!

00:44.067 --> 00:46.200
(screaming)
But don't worry.

00:47.267 --> 00:51.933
We're still proper radge.
Which means getting inebriated.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.633
You mean mortal?

00:56.667 --> 01:00.067
Lots of fornication!
Shagging, you divvy!

01:02.133 --> 01:05.132
Hello!
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.567
(exclaims)

01:08.133 --> 01:10.233
(screaming)

01:10.300 --> 01:12.200
Fuck off now!

01:19.400 --> 01:21.767
Shut your fucking mouth!
(cheering)

01:21.833 --> 01:23.867
Gonna be pure fucking belter!

01:28.167 --> 01:29.700
Hello, yous!

01:29.767 --> 01:33.200
Yes, Holly's back!
My bitch is back in the house.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.967
We are doing Newcastle Pride!

01:38.000 --> 01:41.400
Chloe, how's it going with you
and Sam? Really, really good.

01:41.467 --> 01:44.533
It is so good to hear
that Chloe and Sam are going
well.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.633
Having been in a relationship,
I know how hard it can be.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.733
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
Oh, my God, it's Alex,

01:51.800 --> 01:53.833
my holiday romance from
Australia.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.300
He knows
we've got unfinished business.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.033
Calm down, Sophie is right
there.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.467
Is he fuck hurting me!

02:07.733 --> 02:11.367
His hair's fucking shit
and he needs to learn a lesson.

02:13.733 --> 02:14.967
Alex is being stupid.

02:15.033 --> 02:17.567
He has no idea
how much he's hurting Sophie.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.367
(sobbing)

02:21.167 --> 02:23.100
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.167
I'm preened to perfection.

02:25.233 --> 02:28.133
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.467
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:31.533 --> 02:33.700
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:33.767 --> 02:36.867
I'm happy-go-lucky,
a Jack-the-lad. That's me to a
T.

02:36.933 --> 02:39.633
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.700
I don't go on the pull,
the girls just love the guns.

02:42.767 --> 02:45.433
What you see is what you get.
Bags of fun.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.500
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.633
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

02:59.800 --> 03:01.333
Ohh!

03:01.400 --> 03:03.900
Last night, I cried myself to
sleep,

03:03.967 --> 03:06.167
but I've woke up being
determined

03:06.233 --> 03:10.267
that is the last time
I ever cry over a boy.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.000
Well, until the next time.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.667
How are you feeling?
It was all going well.

03:14.733 --> 03:17.833
Until I found out
that he said that he fancies
you.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.667
'This is awkward.'

03:19.733 --> 03:22.700
I hope that Sophie knows
that I am no threat,

03:22.767 --> 03:25.567
and Alex was just pissed
and being a bit of a dick.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.300
I don't think
he said it maliciously, I don't.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.667
I hope Sophie
stops overthinking this.

03:30.733 --> 03:34.800
I don't want her to miss out on
the
opportunity of having fun with
him.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.033
I think he's a thick fucking
bastard.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.300
Wow!

03:40.367 --> 03:42.867
Like, Pride was amazing.

03:42.933 --> 03:47.100
But I feel like
I've been hit by a fucking
train.

03:47.167 --> 03:51.033
I woke up this morning
and I feel disgusting.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.700
Sophie's really upset.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.800
Chloe threw cake at Alex's face.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.733
I also threw chicken tikka.
Yeah.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.333
I dunno why,
cos I love fucking chicken
tikka.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.967
'When am I gonna learn
not to throw good food?'

04:02.033 --> 04:05.400
I need to throw shit food,
like a beef bourguignon.

04:05.467 --> 04:07.767
I fucked up there.
What are you gonna do?

04:07.833 --> 04:11.400
Obviously I'm gonna apologise
and just admit my wrongs.

04:11.467 --> 04:15.300
Since I got to Newcastle, I
haven't
dealt with Sophie and I very
well.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.800
Hopefully she can talk to me
today.

04:18.767 --> 04:22.300
(fart)
You haven't shit yourself, have
you?

04:22.367 --> 04:25.533
On that note,
I'm going to check on Sophie.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.200
Come on, my little cherub.

04:33.267 --> 04:35.500
Oh, hello, you!
Let's go for a cup of tea.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.033
Takes a lot
for someone to get me out of
bed,

04:38.100 --> 04:41.633
but waking up to your beautiful
face is an exception.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.667
I'm gutted she threw that cake.

04:43.733 --> 04:46.633
I know, I would have enjoyed
that cake today.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.200
I might be hanging out my arse,
but I know Sophie, deep down,

04:50.267 --> 04:52.867
will be feeling much worse
after what happened.

04:52.933 --> 04:57.333
I just felt like I'd been
really, really mugged off,

04:57.400 --> 05:00.100
and I can't stand being mugged
off.
I know.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.967
I just necked on with him,

05:02.033 --> 05:04.167
and then he said
he fancies my friend.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.767
I'm standing there
like an absolute freak.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.533
I'm a bit gutted,
cos I thought Alex being here

05:09.600 --> 05:13.433
would put a smile on Sophie's
face,
but it's fucking with her head.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.167
I was upset,
like, for fuck's sake, not
again.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.567
I really like Alex,
and I do wish he was the man for
me,

05:19.633 --> 05:21.267
but there's a few issues.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.467
He's immature, he's too young,

05:23.533 --> 05:26.267
he lives on the other side
of the fucking globe.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.667
How many frogs have I gotta
kiss?

05:36.567 --> 05:38.200
Me and Sam are in a good place.

05:38.267 --> 05:40.700
I wanna spend some quality time,
me and you.

05:40.767 --> 05:43.567
I have got the perfect plan
to keep him on his toes.

05:43.633 --> 05:45.067
What are you suggesting?

05:45.133 --> 05:47.467
I'm gonna take you on a date.
Taking me?

05:47.533 --> 05:50.133
Yeah, but you're gonna pay.
Right.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.767
How much money do I need?
20 quid.

05:52.833 --> 05:55.167
Is that it? Fuck, a cheap date.
Haway, then

05:55.233 --> 05:56.433
I'm excited.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.167
Thanks, mate.
Any more sauce, or not?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.533
Sophie hasn't even looked at me
this morning.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.333
I need to clear the air with
her.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.833
That looks good.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.567
Don't speak to me.
Why not?

06:19.633 --> 06:21.267
I'm in a bad mood with you.
Why?

06:21.333 --> 06:23.600
Cos I am.
Can I speak to you later on?

06:23.667 --> 06:25.033
I'm still cross at Alex,

06:25.100 --> 06:27.967
but I'm also annoyed at myself
for getting upset.

06:28.033 --> 06:31.300
And he IS right, we do need
to speak, but not right now.

06:31.367 --> 06:34.267
Maybe we should talk.
Yeah, good. What's that?

06:34.333 --> 06:36.300
Just go, please.
No.

06:36.367 --> 06:40.700
Never, ever stand around a woman
when she's cooking. OK, rightio.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.467
See yous later!

06:51.533 --> 06:54.933
I'm so excited that Chloe
is taking me out on a date,

06:55.000 --> 06:56.633
but why have we got our coats?

06:56.700 --> 06:57.833
It's summer!

07:01.667 --> 07:03.933
I feel like
you're gonna really like it.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.233
I'm excited.
I can't wait to show off.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.833
Show off what?

07:07.900 --> 07:10.067
You will soon see, honey.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.767
Right, close your eyes.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.000
Me and Sam
have been together a year,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.467
but there's one thing
he hasn't seen us do.

07:16.533 --> 07:19.433
Surprise!
(laughs) Ice skating?!

07:19.500 --> 07:20.833
Chloe can ice skate,

07:20.900 --> 07:24.000
but it's not something
that's floated my boat,

07:24.067 --> 07:26.800
so I can't wait to watch her
with a hot chocolate.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.433
This is good, Chloe.
I know, I'm the best.

07:33.933 --> 07:37.133
Always in the mirror, you.
Do you know what I need? Botox.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.467
On me forehead.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.533
Ooh, there's me girls.
There she is.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.133
Oh, hello, you.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.267
Alex came over
and was like, "Do you mind

07:45.333 --> 07:47.833
if me and you go for a chat?"
Is he American?

07:47.900 --> 07:50.600
Me and Alex
do need to talk things through,

07:50.667 --> 07:53.600
away from the rest,
and I have just the place to go.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.000
He can even buy us fish and
chips.

07:56.067 --> 07:58.767
I was upset last night,
and then today,

07:58.833 --> 08:02.867
he is single, and this was when
I
didn't want anything to do with
him.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.167
Yeah.
This is progress for Sophie.

08:05.233 --> 08:09.200
I really want her to have fun
with Alex. They're good
together.

08:09.267 --> 08:11.000
I don't know who's in the right.

08:11.067 --> 08:14.100
I just think because you kissed
him,
you felt mugged off

08:14.167 --> 08:16.233
cos you found out after.
Yeah.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.633
If you hadn't found out,
you wouldn't have gave a fuck.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.167
I bet you will sort it out and
he'll be fingering you by
tonight.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.600
When I walk out of a club,
I can barely stand up,

08:32.667 --> 08:34.767
but on the ice,
I'm the Queen of Sheba.

08:34.832 --> 08:37.700
(classical music plays)

08:39.033 --> 08:41.299
Whoa-hoa! What the fuck?!

08:42.700 --> 08:45.333
How have you done with your
legs?!
Look at that.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.267
Fucking hell!

08:47.333 --> 08:51.233
I knew Chloe could ice skate,
but I didn't know she was this
good.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.600
She can barely stand up
at the best of times.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.233
(laughs) Fucking hell!

09:03.300 --> 09:05.733
It's your turn.
(music dies)

09:05.800 --> 09:08.733
I really don't wanna do this.
I know I'm gonna be shit.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.633
For you, I'll give it my best
shot.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.767
Go on, then, Tinkerbell.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.133
Oh, I don't like it.
(toots whistle)

09:19.900 --> 09:21.533
Fuck me!

09:22.533 --> 09:23.967
Fuck off.

09:24.033 --> 09:27.300
The last time I seen Sam like
that,
too many shots of tequila.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.300
Oh!

09:29.367 --> 09:31.433
Ahh!
(toots whistle)

09:31.500 --> 09:33.933
(exclaims)

09:34.000 --> 09:36.100
How do I get up? Chloe. Chloe.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.767
Waah!

09:37.833 --> 09:40.400
What a twat!
Chloe... Chloe!

09:40.467 --> 09:42.000
Oh, didn't fall.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.433
Let me see you spin.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.900
How'd you do that?

09:47.967 --> 09:50.633
You won't be doing that
by the end of the session.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.033
Ohhh!
I've given it a good go.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.800
I'm shit and my bones are
hurting.
I need to get to the sidelines.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.500
That was fucking sexy, that,
like.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.567
Really?
I've never seen anything like
it.

10:03.633 --> 10:06.400
Seeing Chloe ice skate today
was unbelievable.

10:06.467 --> 10:10.100
I didn't think it was possible
to fall any more in love with
her,

10:10.167 --> 10:11.467
but today I have.

10:11.533 --> 10:15.067
I mean, I was a bit
embarrassing.
That was terrible.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.500
I can't really talk now
cos of me tits.

10:17.567 --> 10:18.767
Tell you what.

10:18.833 --> 10:22.033
It's good for us to spend
a bit of time, just me and you.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.267
Today has been good.
The perfect date.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.633
This has been amazing.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.500
I wanted to spice things up,

10:27.567 --> 10:30.533
and he definitely got a semi
off my pirouette.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.133
Right, come on.
Come on.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.767
Oh, my God!
Here we go again.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.400
Ohh!
No.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.767
Careful!
You're the one running into me.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.933
Never push a woman
when she's eating.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.600
I'm just watching the scenery.
Too beautiful. Seeing the views.

10:50.667 --> 10:51.667
Alex.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.700
Me and Alex WERE a holiday
romance,

10:53.767 --> 10:56.833
and I was happy with that then,
and I'm happy now,

10:56.900 --> 11:00.467
but then again, holiday romances
still have their rules.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.700
Is it an Aussie thing
for lads to be mugs?

11:02.767 --> 11:05.767
Erm... No, I think
this is an Alex thing

11:05.833 --> 11:08.767
where I say things sometimes.

11:08.833 --> 11:12.167
I do appreciate the honesty,
but I wanna get one thing clear.

11:12.233 --> 11:14.233
Yeah.
Do you wanna shag Abbie?

11:14.300 --> 11:15.967
No.
Do you wanna shag me?

11:16.033 --> 11:19.367
Yeah. I didn't think
you were gonna say that straight
up.

11:19.433 --> 11:20.667
Like this side of Alex,

11:20.733 --> 11:23.400
when he can be assertive
and knows what he wants.

11:23.467 --> 11:26.567
What do we do now, then?
Do you wanna be friends again?

11:26.633 --> 11:28.567
Mm...
Friends?

11:28.633 --> 11:31.100
Friends?
With benefits, again.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.700
The guns have done it again!
Come on, let's go.

11:33.767 --> 11:36.067
OK.
Fucking hell, Alex.

11:36.133 --> 11:40.333
I am glad that me and Alex have
decided to be friends with
benefits.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.600
I hope I've made the right
decision.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.467
Hard work, you.

11:45.667 --> 11:48.233
Tonight has got fun
written all over it.

11:49.800 --> 11:54.000
Holly keeps feeding me a drink,
and it's fucking disgusting.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.500
If there's anything to put me
off
shagging him, it is that.

11:59.567 --> 12:02.300
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

12:03.967 --> 12:04.167
.

12:06.700 --> 12:06.900
.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.433
Boys, I'd love to spend
loads of time with you.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.433
I'm going with the girls.
Leaving us for the girls?

12:22.667 --> 12:25.233
Fucking sweating me tits off
here.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.067
Oh, my God, does it tickle?

12:27.133 --> 12:29.200
We're all getting ready for
tonight,

12:29.267 --> 12:31.500
but I'm helping Faith
sort her tan out,

12:31.567 --> 12:34.233
cos let's be honest,
it is a bit shit.

12:43.933 --> 12:46.033
The key is to moisturise.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.467
It doesn't go as dark
with moisturiser.

12:48.533 --> 12:51.767
I know Abbie's trying to help.
When I jump out the shower,

12:51.833 --> 12:54.133
I hoy a few extra layers of tan
back on.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.100
That hasn't went to plan.
Nice.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.800
She's upset.

12:57.867 --> 13:01.433
I'm still not dark enough.
I feel like it's a natural glow.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.967
I don't want a natural glow.
One more layer.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.833
One more layer, Abbie.
One more?

13:08.367 --> 13:10.633
How was your date today with...?

13:10.700 --> 13:13.400
I shouldn't say "date", right?
How was the chat?

13:13.467 --> 13:15.500
Basically, I apologised, first
up.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.700
You've learnt your lesson?
Oh, yeah!

13:17.767 --> 13:18.867
(laughs)

13:18.933 --> 13:22.533
If Alex came with a plan
to get in Sophie's pants again,

13:22.600 --> 13:24.767
he must have left it on the
plane,

13:24.833 --> 13:27.233
cos nothing is going right
with these two.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.167
A lot in two days.
Who've you got to blame?

13:30.233 --> 13:32.333
That's myself.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.200
Least you're honest.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.867
Right, I need to finish
getting fucking ready.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.167
You get your make-up on there,
Sam.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.200
I don't wear make-up, right?

13:42.267 --> 13:44.367
Well, I do. Simple as that.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.733
Introducing
the new and improved Faith!

13:49.800 --> 13:51.700
(cheering)

13:51.767 --> 13:54.633
I mean, I don't know, Abbie.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.800
To me, Faith looks exactly the
same.
She added on more tan in secret.

13:58.867 --> 14:01.933
Faith, with your new look,
are you on the pull tonight?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.933
I'm always on the pull, Sam.
(cheering)

14:05.000 --> 14:08.533
I feel like the family are
starting
to accept us for who I am.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.233
'Bring on tonight.'
Here's to me! Fuck yous all!

14:12.300 --> 14:16.467
Right, let's get out
and get fucking mortal!

14:16.533 --> 14:19.400
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, my God, my tits nearly fell
out.

14:29.833 --> 14:32.700
She smiled at me
cos she wants that dick.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.500
Whoo! Whoo!

14:34.567 --> 14:36.800
It is so good
to be back with this lot.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.067
Tonight has got fun
written all over it.

15:07.467 --> 15:11.400
I have spent hours
helping Faith with her tan
tonight.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.267
It's only right we go on the
pull.

15:27.933 --> 15:29.867
Abbie!

15:29.933 --> 15:31.700
'Fuck me!'

15:31.767 --> 15:34.700
Now, that was quick.
Who the hell is this?!

15:44.200 --> 15:47.600
Calm down, Abbie.
A gentleman doesn't kiss and
tell.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.600
But we may have engaged in
coitus.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.867
(screams)

15:55.133 --> 15:58.167
Keep it together, Faith.
You do NOT wanna scare him off.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.533
(cheers)

16:03.600 --> 16:06.767
Faith has actually pulled.
That new tan has worked.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.133
Yeah!

16:13.233 --> 16:15.100
(cheering)

16:15.167 --> 16:18.433
Has Faith
pulled the Rag'n'Bone Man?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.467
I mean, she's only human after
all.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.167
Sophie, you've got a clitoris,
and he's not Mr Right,

16:48.233 --> 16:50.067
he's Mr Holiday Romance.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.200
Faith has changed since
she's come in. She's one of us.

17:10.267 --> 17:11.532
The kinky little minx.

17:17.867 --> 17:22.200
I'm so hot that me lad's trying
to cool us down with ice cubes.

17:22.267 --> 17:24.400
What is going on, like?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.367
Even though Alex
can be a pain in the arse
sometimes,

17:33.433 --> 17:35.233
he's a laugh and he looks fit.

17:53.467 --> 17:57.667
I feel so much more content
the way me and Alex are now.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.533
I mean, it IS just what it is.

18:03.033 --> 18:06.033
I'm glad that Soph and I
are on good terms.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.067
Sophie and I
have a really good connection.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.400
Holly keeps feeding me a drink,
and it's fucking disgusting.

18:23.467 --> 18:27.167
I think I'm gonna be sick,
but I need to try and hide it.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.433
Oh, no! There's more.

18:42.967 --> 18:44.000
Alex!

18:44.067 --> 18:46.200
Oh, my God, stop! Do not drink
that.

18:47.733 --> 18:51.367
What the fuck is this?
Is this the famous brown ale?

18:56.033 --> 18:57.967
Abbie, I'm gonna get you back.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.433
Oops!
That was the wrong fucking
glass.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.267
Come on, guys,
even I am not that rank.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.833
(cheers)

19:11.900 --> 19:15.800
Tonight's been eventful. Nathan
is absolutely off his fucking
chair.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.167
We need to get him
back to the house.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.500
Come on, get in here.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.900
Me lad can't come back
because he's got work tomorrow.

19:26.967 --> 19:30.500
I AM pretty gutted. I was gonna
raid the freezer for more ice.

19:30.567 --> 19:31.633
Come on.

19:36.767 --> 19:41.000
Tonight has been amazing, and
I'm excited to see where we end
up,

19:41.067 --> 19:42.767
if you know what I mean.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.667
Yeah, that's good.

19:53.967 --> 19:56.033
I am the boss of multitasking.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.433
Having a piss in a drain
and eating pizza!

19:58.500 --> 20:00.633
A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

20:02.733 --> 20:05.800
Where's the garlic sauce?
Where's the garlic sauce?

20:05.867 --> 20:08.200
Where is the chilli sauce?

20:08.267 --> 20:12.200
I am so drunk, I don't even know
what the fuck I'm saying,

20:12.267 --> 20:14.500
but this kebab is amazing.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.033
What the fuck?
Oi!

20:18.100 --> 20:20.967
I wanna know something!
Get off.

20:21.033 --> 20:24.633
Has anybody has a good night?
You know what?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.600
It's payback time, bitch.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.500
Ohhh!

20:29.567 --> 20:32.300
Alex, egg in my hair? Really?

20:33.367 --> 20:34.733
I just spilled...!

20:37.533 --> 20:39.200
Fucking kill ya!

20:42.300 --> 20:45.567
That looks really wrong.
Bit weird. I'm gonna go to bed.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.933
I thought me and Alex
were gonna get it on,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.833
but he started a food fight
and he's rolling around with
Abbie.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.267
If there's anything to put me
off
shagging him, it is that.

20:55.333 --> 20:58.467
Night, everyone.
Now I need to wash my hair.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.833
Stop it. Stay there.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.133
Sorry.
Sophie likes a man,

21:07.200 --> 21:10.200
not a person
who gets ravioli on them.

21:10.267 --> 21:12.900
You were supposed to
get with Sophie tonight.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.000
If Sam was messing around
with Abbie,

21:15.067 --> 21:16.733
I'd chop his fucking dick off.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.433
Just I'm having a food fight.
Alex, you call that a food
fight?

21:21.333 --> 21:23.133
Listen!
(shouts)

21:24.333 --> 21:27.633
Stop throwing food!
Go to fucking bed.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.300
Sam, no! No...

21:30.500 --> 21:32.933
Right,
I have had enough bullshit
tonight.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.700
I need to restore some order
in this house.

21:37.167 --> 21:40.033
(shouts)

21:43.167 --> 21:46.633
Right! Time out. This is looking
less like a food fight

21:46.700 --> 21:48.900
and more like a prison riot.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.067
Ahh!

21:53.067 --> 21:55.533
Oh, there he is.
What did I miss?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.833
You getting in?
'No, he's not.'

21:57.900 --> 22:02.533
This boat has sailed for
tonight,
and I cannot be arsed with Alex.

22:04.367 --> 22:06.133
Turn the lamp off.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.867
No, turn it off properly.

22:07.933 --> 22:10.333
I need to go downstairs,
through the mess,

22:10.400 --> 22:12.000
to brush my veneers.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.133
What the fuck was that?!

22:18.200 --> 22:21.333
And that, Nathan, is the sound
of Chloe hitting the deck.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.700
I know it well.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.500
Ohh!

22:27.900 --> 22:30.933
Beep, beep, Newcastle's biggest
dickhead is here.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.667
If he's here,
that means one thing. Work.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.300
Get ready for a blast from the
past.
Come in, son.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.700
Oh, my God!
(all exclaim)

22:40.767 --> 22:43.167
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

22:45.433 --> 22:45.633
.

22:48.167 --> 22:48.367
.

23:05.633 --> 23:08.667
Last night, Alex should have
been
getting with Sophie,

23:08.733 --> 23:11.333
but the bell-end
started a food fight instead.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.733
When is he gonna learn?

23:12.800 --> 23:14.833
Not doing yourself any favours.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.933
You should have went
straight to bed.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.067
I was so pissed off
about drinking sick.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.500
Which is understandable,
but Sophie wants a man.

23:23.567 --> 23:26.833
She doesn't want you to be
chucking eggs like a fucking
hen.

23:26.900 --> 23:30.767
I do get what Chloe's saying,
but everything I seem to do

23:30.833 --> 23:33.967
pisses Sophie off, so I'm gonna
stay clear of her today.

23:34.033 --> 23:36.267
Someone check Nathan's
breathing!

23:36.333 --> 23:38.433
He is.
Got a pulse, has he?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.667
No. He's gone.
Nathan, are you dead?

23:41.733 --> 23:43.867
This is the quietest I've seen
him.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.867
Right, what the fuck
is the smell in this room?

23:48.933 --> 23:51.333
What do you mean?
I can smell HP sauce.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.567
I hoped that when me and Alex
got back to the house,

23:54.633 --> 23:57.600
we'd spend some quality time
together, but instead,

23:57.667 --> 24:01.733
he was starting a food fight,
and I am NOT about that life.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.033
He's great to have around
for a kiss and a cuddle.

24:05.100 --> 24:07.067
Should get the finger...
But...

24:07.133 --> 24:09.867
Just use him for that.
Use him as a human dildo.

24:09.933 --> 24:12.600
I would, Holly,
if he wasn't running around

24:12.667 --> 24:14.900
starting food fights like a
child.

24:14.967 --> 24:17.200
I am gonna let him
sweat it out today.

24:17.267 --> 24:19.700
Do you reckon we've got work?
Oh, no!

24:24.467 --> 24:25.900
Going downstairs.

24:25.967 --> 24:27.567
Yous, this is a joke.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.367
Oh, my fucking God.

24:29.433 --> 24:32.833
This house is a mess.
This is not something I've
missed.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.000
Urgh, it stinks of fucking shit!

24:35.067 --> 24:37.800
I have no words.
Where are we supposed to sit?

24:37.867 --> 24:40.067
I'm no grass,
but it was Abbie, Alex...

24:40.133 --> 24:41.633
Nathan.
And Nate.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.967
I would never do this. I'm not
five.

24:44.033 --> 24:47.667
I cannot believe the state of
this house. Alex started this
shit.

24:47.733 --> 24:50.700
I thought he would have
grown out of it by now.

24:50.767 --> 24:54.267
Urgh! Fucking kebab on the sofa.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.200
What is that on the wall?
Well, there's nowt to eat.

24:57.267 --> 25:00.700
Question is, who's cleaning it
up?
Well, the people who did it.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.700
(horn toots)

25:07.767 --> 25:10.767
Beep, beep, Newcastle's
biggest dickhead is here,

25:10.833 --> 25:12.833
and according to his schedule,

25:12.900 --> 25:16.000
you divvies have got work today,
so fucking suit up.

25:16.067 --> 25:19.800
Get it cleaned, then.
Fucking hell, man.

25:19.867 --> 25:23.833
I love Scott, but if he's here,
that means one thing. Work.

25:23.900 --> 25:27.000
I know you make mess and that,
but how is this possible?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.467
I've walked in the house,

25:28.533 --> 25:31.133
and the state of the place,
if Ann had seen this,

25:31.200 --> 25:32.967
her fanny would blow off.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.467
How do you live in this?
Can't.

25:36.533 --> 25:38.733
Scott, you used to be
right in the mix.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.800
No, not this. This...
This is next level, this, like.

25:41.867 --> 25:43.533
Right, first things first.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.933
Where've you been? Nice to see
you.
Been on me jollies, me.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.133
Looking good, kid.
Thank you, Scott!

25:49.200 --> 25:50.967
Secondly, who are you?

25:51.033 --> 25:53.033
He's like a miniature version of
me.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.833
Like a brick shithouse,
blond hair, blue eyes.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.233
I bet he hasn't got
a belter cock like me.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.300
Big lad, aren't you?
I try.

26:00.367 --> 26:02.733
You've got some competition,
there, kid.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.700
Listen.
As yous all know, there's work.

26:05.767 --> 26:07.667
Tash On Tours.
So, today,

26:07.733 --> 26:11.333
Chloe, Sam, Nathan, Abbie and
Faith
are going to work,

26:11.400 --> 26:13.433
and this new kid can come along.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.233
What's your name?
Alex.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.567
Gonna stay in this house,
you gotta do some graft. Yeah.

26:18.633 --> 26:21.033
You don't have to go to work.
Thanks, babe!

26:21.100 --> 26:23.533
Cos you're fucking shite at it.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.833
I'm gonna meet everyone later,
but I can't stay any longer.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.900
If I stay in here another
minute,

26:28.967 --> 26:31.633
I'm gonna end up
with rabies and trench foot.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.833
Make sure you're on fucking
time.
Bye!

26:33.900 --> 26:35.933
See ya.
Bye.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.333
Get out.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.333
Get the fuck out.
I mean,

26:39.400 --> 26:41.667
I'm gutted for everyone, but
thanks.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.167
He knew
I wouldn't do any work anyway.

26:44.233 --> 26:48.600
Tell you something.
I wish I was as dirty as this
house.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.167
Oh, asleep.
Oh, in the corner, asleep again.

26:54.233 --> 26:57.000
Wakey, wakey.
Oh, you've woke her up.

27:07.133 --> 27:09.033
Boys, wait for me.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.967
Hurry up!
Bye.

27:12.233 --> 27:16.133
I can't believe Sophie, Holly
and Adam don't have to go to
work,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.233
and I'm hanging from last night.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.000
Oh, well. Hair of the dog it is.

27:21.067 --> 27:23.567
Ohh, okie, okie, okie.

27:31.767 --> 27:34.633
So let's get there,
smash it to bits,

27:34.700 --> 27:37.033
and show some people our tits.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.533
Yass.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.133
We rocked up
and there's no sign of Scott.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.467
He is supposed to be leading
by example, the lanky twat.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.933
What are you drinking?

27:52.033 --> 27:53.400
Hello, party crew.

27:53.467 --> 27:56.300
A little bit late there.
Whaay!

27:56.367 --> 27:58.833
Listen.
I've only just come to say
hello.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.433
I can't be arsed to stay.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.667
But I've brought a mate along
to keep yous company.

28:03.733 --> 28:05.600
A mate?
And help you out.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.267
Ladies and gentlemen,
divvies and dickheads,

28:08.333 --> 28:09.567
a blast from the past.

28:09.633 --> 28:13.233
Come in, son.
It's Kyle. Fucking yay.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.467
(cheering)
Oh, my God, it's Holly's ex,
Kyle.

28:16.533 --> 28:19.033
(cheering)
Hello, you.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.767
I haven't done Tash On Tours in
a long time, but I couldn't
resist.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.167
All right?
All right?

28:25.233 --> 28:26.500
All right?

28:26.567 --> 28:30.033
It's so good seeing Kyle,
cos it's been ages.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.600
But I don't know what Holly's
gonna say when she finds out.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.733
It's a bit awkward,
cos Holly's back.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.433
Spanner in the works.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.967
I forgot to mention
Holly was in the house.

28:41.033 --> 28:44.700
When I come to think, I did that
on purpose and I don't give a
fuck.

28:44.767 --> 28:47.400
Will it be awkward?
(stammers)

28:47.467 --> 28:50.933
Me and Holly didn't split up
on the best of terms,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.100
but it's been two years since
then,

28:53.167 --> 28:55.467
and I'm pretty sure
we've both moved on.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.167
Kyle.

28:57.233 --> 28:58.733
Have fun, kid!

28:58.800 --> 29:00.933
Oh! See yous later.
Thanks.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
I know I give them hell,
but it's only cos I love them.

29:04.067 --> 29:06.667
Sort of. Ta-ra.

29:06.733 --> 29:09.533
Let's stop fucking about.
We've got work to do.

29:12.700 --> 29:15.700
Welcome to Tash On Tours,
everyone.
Grab a shot.

29:15.767 --> 29:18.533
Only one way
to get this party started.
Shots.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.933
One, two, three!
Cheers!

29:21.000 --> 29:24.233
Everyone, I'm Faith,
and the first game we're gonna
play

29:24.300 --> 29:25.733
is called Blow And Suck.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.367
Suck And Blow.
Suck And Blow!

29:27.433 --> 29:31.000
So, the rules are, you've gotta
pass the card down the line.

29:31.067 --> 29:33.967
Whoever drops it
has to kiss the person.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.567
There's lipstick on there!

29:35.633 --> 29:37.733
Abbie, you're letting us down.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.833
'Play the game or do the
forfeit.
It's simple. Up your game,
girl.'

29:41.900 --> 29:43.467
That's not a kiss!

29:43.533 --> 29:47.233
That's not a kiss. It's gotta...
It's gotta be on the lips.

29:54.333 --> 29:58.433
I am absolutely over the moon
that we didn't have to go to
work.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.300
I love spending time with Holly.

30:00.367 --> 30:03.133
We've been getting ready
in this house for years,

30:03.200 --> 30:06.000
and we love nothing more
than a good girlie gossip.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.567
Remember the couples
we used to share with?

30:08.633 --> 30:10.600
I know.
And now it's Sam and Chloe.

30:10.667 --> 30:14.333
Since I've been back, I've
noticed
Sam and Chloe are inseparable.

30:14.400 --> 30:18.167
It's good she spends time with
him,
but we're here, too.

30:18.233 --> 30:22.233
Know what's funny? When I was
spending any time with Kyle in
here,

30:22.300 --> 30:24.467
Chloe and that
would always say that,

30:24.533 --> 30:27.467
"Oh, Holly doesn't spend any
time
with the girls."

30:27.533 --> 30:29.200
Chloe does it worse.
She does.

30:29.267 --> 30:30.400
I dunno, it's sad.

30:30.467 --> 30:33.967
I don't wanna see somebody
lose a bit of themselves for a
man.

30:34.033 --> 30:37.100
When I was with Kyle,
I put him before everybody else,

30:37.167 --> 30:40.367
which caused a load of problems
AND made me miserable.

30:40.433 --> 30:43.100
After we broke up,
I became fun Holly again.

30:43.167 --> 30:46.233
I DO like them together, I do,
and I think at points,

30:46.300 --> 30:48.967
they are good,
but I'd like to see the old
Chloe.

30:49.033 --> 30:52.000
When we went to Blackpool,
she was the old Chloe.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.667
I wish you could see her.
She was so much fun.

30:54.733 --> 30:55.800
Come on.

30:55.867 --> 30:59.800
I'm heading out with the girls.
I've never been out with two
girls.

30:59.867 --> 31:03.400
I bet you I'll look like a right
player. Or their gay best
friend.

31:11.867 --> 31:14.167
Here we go! Here we go!
Go, go, go, go!

31:14.233 --> 31:15.400
(shouting)

31:15.467 --> 31:16.967
Right, guys, take five.

31:17.033 --> 31:19.733
This Tash On Tours
has been a proper success,

31:19.800 --> 31:20.933
but before we go out,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.767
me and Chloe need to catch up
with our old pal Kyle.

31:23.833 --> 31:24.967
Madame!

31:25.033 --> 31:27.700
I've just been... Like a pirate.
How are you?

31:27.767 --> 31:31.267
I'm good. How are you?
Still got your nipple pierced?

31:33.200 --> 31:36.900
Yay! Me and Kyle used to be SO
close
when he lived in the house,

31:36.967 --> 31:39.833
but since he broke up with
Holly,
I haven't seen him.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.467
Still got yours done?
No.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.067
I took it out. I'm sorry, I
know.

31:44.133 --> 31:48.400
When all the shit was happening,
Nathan was always there for me.

31:48.467 --> 31:51.600
When was the last time yous
talked?
When we broke up.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.567
Shut up! That long ago?

31:53.633 --> 31:57.933
So I left the house with her,
when I left you, I left you as
well.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.033
Me and Holly
were together three years

32:00.100 --> 32:03.267
but we couldn't make a
relationship
work inside the house

32:03.333 --> 32:05.400
so we left together to make it
work.

32:05.467 --> 32:10.133
Then after that, we broke up,
and we haven't spoke since,
never.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.533
It's great to see Kyle,

32:11.600 --> 32:14.367
but these two could go on at
this
all fucking neet,

32:14.433 --> 32:16.700
and I wanna go out
on the fucking toon.

32:16.767 --> 32:20.167
Fuck this shit.
I wanna go and get... clubbing!

32:20.233 --> 32:21.967
(cheering)

32:22.033 --> 32:23.600
But! Kyle.

32:23.667 --> 32:27.667
This guy seems sound as fuck.
Come on, Kyle, let's get the
club.

32:28.633 --> 32:32.900
It's not a good idea, especially
if Holly's gonna be there.

32:32.967 --> 32:35.467
I'll come, mate.
(cheering)

32:35.533 --> 32:37.567
For old time's sake.
Right, guys!

32:37.633 --> 32:39.900
But I've had a few drinks,
so fuck it!

32:39.967 --> 32:42.167
Haway, then.
You need to get changed.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.133
Sophie needs a man,
so that's what I'm gonna give
her.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.167
Maybe he WAS listening all
along.
Oh, my God, my fucking ex, Kyle.

32:58.467 --> 33:02.033
It's like the final episode
of a really good soap. Oh, my
God.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

33:06.933 --> 33:07.133
.

33:09.667 --> 33:09.867
.

33:24.933 --> 33:27.333
We get to the club
and we're in the VIP room.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.400
No sign of the others.
Scott must be working them hard.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.533
Oh, aye! More booze for us
ladies.

33:39.033 --> 33:40.867
'I am excited for tonight.'

33:40.933 --> 33:44.667
I just wish Sam would have spoke
to us before he invited Kyle
out.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.733
I do not know how Holly
is gonna react. Have to see.

33:54.133 --> 33:58.367
Oh, my God, my fucking ex, Kyle,
has just walked through the
door.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.467
'What the fuck
is he doing with them?'

34:02.800 --> 34:04.933
Hiya, mate.
Holly looks great,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.233
but she also looks horrified
to see us.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.800
In the excitement of seeing
Kyle,

34:12.867 --> 34:17.033
I forgot about Holly
and how she would feel.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.233
This is a massive shock.

34:19.300 --> 34:23.132
Kyle's here, and him and Holly
haven't spoke for ages.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.500
Kyle has only been here
a few minutes and he's reminding
me

34:46.567 --> 34:47.567
why he's my ex.

34:57.867 --> 35:01.467
Back in the day, I made a really
tough decision to leave the
family

35:01.533 --> 35:03.800
and put Kyle
and our relationship first.

35:03.867 --> 35:05.933
'I gave up everything for him.'

35:06.000 --> 35:08.433
So when I realised
that he didn't give a shit,

35:08.500 --> 35:10.167
it WAS a hard pill to swallow.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.267
Fair play to Holly.
She is playing it so cool.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.267
If my ex, Marty, walked in,
I would go akka.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.133
Seeing Kyle is making me think,

35:44.200 --> 35:48.467
where would I be if I was still
in a relationship with him?

35:48.533 --> 35:50.867
I certainly would not be as
happy
as I am.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.867
Sam's right,
I do need to talk to her.

36:20.933 --> 36:24.200
He knows how difficult it is
to be with a girl and be in a
house

36:24.267 --> 36:25.833
with all of her mates.

36:29.767 --> 36:31.000
Yes, Kyle! Finally,

36:31.067 --> 36:34.500
somebody who understands
what it's like living in this
house.

36:36.867 --> 36:38.933
(both laugh)

36:46.100 --> 36:49.167
Alex looks really fit,
AND he's pretty sober.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.133
I'm gonna lay me cards on the
table

36:51.200 --> 36:53.833
and let him know
exactly what I want from him.

37:19.867 --> 37:23.567
Sophie needs a man,
so that's what I'm gonna give
her.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.067
Kyle has come clubbing tonight
and made things really awkward,

37:47.133 --> 37:49.467
so me and Adam
are gonna keep out the way.

37:57.367 --> 37:59.000
Eurgh!

38:01.233 --> 38:05.700
Now, this is the Alex I like
and want.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.767
Maybe he WAS listening all
along.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.367
Tonight has been an awkward one,
but it's been great to see Kyle.

38:25.433 --> 38:28.467
Let's get the fuck out of here
and get back to the house.

38:31.667 --> 38:35.500
I shouldn't go back, but it
could be
the opportunity to talk to
Holly.

38:39.267 --> 38:40.600
I wanna sit with you.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.867
I am not getting in the same
taxi
as Kyle.

38:42.933 --> 38:45.100
What bell-end invited him back?

38:56.367 --> 38:58.867
Fucking chips!

38:58.933 --> 39:00.167
One, two, three.

39:00.233 --> 39:01.333
(puffs out)

39:01.400 --> 39:06.433
Right, compose yourself, Holly.
This does not have to be a big
deal.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.267
I have the kebab, kebab, kebab,
kab.

39:09.333 --> 39:11.767
I need some scran in me,
cos I'm Hank.

39:11.833 --> 39:12.933
Hey!

39:14.300 --> 39:15.300
Yeah.

39:15.367 --> 39:18.000
Back at the house,
and it actually feels weird.

39:18.067 --> 39:21.033
Last time I was here
we were in a relationship,

39:21.100 --> 39:23.667
and now I'm hiding behind
Sophie.

39:23.733 --> 39:27.033
I need to get some balls
and get this over with.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.533
Holly, can I speak to you?
It's just one word.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.900
Make friends, and then we're
done.

39:31.967 --> 39:35.400
Tonight has been so awkward
between Holly and Kyle.

39:35.467 --> 39:38.200
I just hope in a few years
that is not me and Sam.

39:38.267 --> 39:40.200
All rightio.

39:40.267 --> 39:44.533
I know I shouldn't say this,
but I would love to be out
there.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.600
It's like the final episode
of a really good soap.

39:47.667 --> 39:50.900
I'm sorry for everything
that happened, outside, inside.

39:50.967 --> 39:54.800
There's no need to apologise.
Like, you are you, I am me.

39:54.867 --> 39:56.933
We were together, it ended.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.267
And I just hope

39:59.333 --> 40:02.333
that you learnt from the
situation
that we were in.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.733
And you learnt as well.

40:03.800 --> 40:07.033
I learnt
to not be treated like that.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.967
Ouch! That was harsh.
But I'm trying to be nice.

40:10.033 --> 40:13.133
It wasn't just me.
No, I know. Honestly, we were
young.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.200
It IS difficult. I see it
in Chloe and Sam, like, I do.

40:16.267 --> 40:17.467
I say to Chloe,

40:17.533 --> 40:20.600
"Please don't let him
take away who you are."

40:20.667 --> 40:23.033
I lost a lot of meself
in the relationship,

40:23.100 --> 40:24.767
and I never want her to do that.

40:24.833 --> 40:27.200
I lost a lot of myself in you.
(scoffs)

40:27.267 --> 40:29.600
Come on!
Oh, my God!

40:29.667 --> 40:32.733
It's so clear speaking to Kyle
that he still believes

40:32.800 --> 40:35.833
that he was at no fault
during our relationship.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.167
Kyle, you need
a fucking reality check.

40:39.633 --> 40:43.100
Lad in a relationship, doesn't
wanna
be in the relationship,

40:43.167 --> 40:44.500
hadn't lived before me,

40:44.567 --> 40:48.833
you hadn't gone out and done all
the threesomes and shagged
about.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.233
You needed to do that.

40:50.300 --> 40:53.600
Holly's right, but I did love
her,
and looking back on it,

40:53.667 --> 40:57.600
the relationship just wasn't
right
for me at that time in me life.

40:57.667 --> 41:00.900
I would never be with someone
who would treat us with respect.

41:00.967 --> 41:04.533
Well, now I'm with someone
who really treats us with
respect.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.300
I'm happy for you,
like you'd be happy with me.

41:07.367 --> 41:11.000
Of course. I honestly hope you
find
someone who makes you change.

41:11.067 --> 41:12.367
Who makes you think...

41:12.433 --> 41:15.933
Fucking hell! Jesus Christ!
...you can be an amazing person.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.567
I don't know
why you're getting frustrated.

41:18.633 --> 41:21.467
I have grown up since me and
you.
I hope you have.

41:21.533 --> 41:23.367
It's been a long fucking time.

41:23.433 --> 41:26.233
But I'm in a fabulous situation.
I know.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.567
I'm the best person I've ever
been.

41:28.633 --> 41:31.233
And one day
I hope that you can have that,
too.

41:31.300 --> 41:34.300
Thank you. I appreciate that.
You wanna fist bump?

41:34.367 --> 41:36.067
(laughs)

41:36.133 --> 41:40.433
Me and Kyle will never be mates,
but we've spoken open and
honestly

41:40.500 --> 41:42.733
and as far as I'm concerned,
it is done.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.767
Let me get that door for you.

41:45.833 --> 41:47.933
Seeing Holly and Kyle tonight

41:48.000 --> 41:50.933
makes me realise what a good
place
me and Chloe are in.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.833
I'd hate for us to end up like
that.

41:53.867 --> 41:56.867
Right, I'll see yous
in another life.

41:57.867 --> 41:59.667
That looks like it went well.

41:59.733 --> 42:02.633
Are you staying, or...?
No, I'll go.

42:02.700 --> 42:06.000
To be honest, I didn't know
how well that was gonna go,

42:06.067 --> 42:08.400
but I kind of think it went
well.

42:08.467 --> 42:10.533
On that note,
it's time for me to go.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.100
I'm in the boys' room!

42:18.167 --> 42:21.100
I didn't really know
how I was gonna feel

42:21.167 --> 42:24.033
if I ever saw Kyle again,
but I AM glad we had the chat,

42:24.100 --> 42:28.400
and it's just made me realise
how much of a good place I'm in,

42:28.467 --> 42:30.067
and I could not be happier.

42:35.667 --> 42:38.300
Alex finally started
acting like a man tonight.

42:38.367 --> 42:40.700
I'm happy
that we're cosying up together,

42:40.767 --> 42:43.500
but I'm gonna make him wait
a little bit longer.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.100
(fart)

42:47.167 --> 42:48.600
Ohh!

42:51.933 --> 42:53.367
Surprise!

42:53.433 --> 42:57.400
You only turn 21 once.
I am in birthday heaven.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.733
I love a bit of candyfloss, me.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.267
This is champion!

43:03.200 --> 43:06.033
Thank you very much.
I've been sick all morning.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.433
That's a good birthday.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.867
I can't...

43:10.300 --> 43:11.867
She strikes again! Ooh!

43:11.933 --> 43:15.867
What the fuck?!
Once again we're saying goodbye.

43:15.933 --> 43:17.833
I'm gonna miss you.

43:17.900 --> 43:22.033
I'm glad I took Holly's advice
and
shagged him when I could,
though.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.433
Don't talk to no strangers!
I'm coming home, baby!

43:27.233 --> 43:29.933
'What about Scotty T?'

43:30.000 --> 43:31.600
'You bunch of arseholes.'

43:59.867 --> 44:00.067
.
