WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:03.840
They say we know more
about space than the oceans.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.160
-You think they're bite marks?
-What's gonna bite an orca?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.600
What happened to the lobster?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.640
She threw it away.
Down the waste disposal.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.080
-What's that?
-Ice worms.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.640
It looks like
you've stumbled on a new species.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.800
Smack in the middle of
Hovedstad's fields in the Norwegian Sea.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.560
If the worms, or anything we discover,
proves to be environmentally sensitive,

00:30.800 --> 00:31.760
it will be in my report.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.920
Hope the reason you're not answering

00:37.160 --> 00:39.280
is because you're with
that hot guy from the boat.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.280
Miss you.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.800
Water and marble and that silentness

00:59.840 --> 01:02.960
Which is not broken by wheel or hoof

01:03.120 --> 01:07.560
A city like a water lily
Less seen than reflected

01:08.400 --> 01:10.280
Palace wall and roof

01:11.640 --> 01:14.520
In the unfruitful waters motionless

01:14.680 --> 01:17.920
Without one living grass's green reproof

01:18.600 --> 01:22.120
A city without joy or weariness

01:22.280 --> 01:25.880
Itself beholding, from itself aloof

01:29.920 --> 01:31.960
"Venice" by Arthur Symons.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
How did...

01:33.280 --> 01:35.520
Do you really think
you're the first person

01:35.760 --> 01:38.360
to read that on a bridge in Venice?

01:41.880 --> 01:44.480
-I know a much better Symons poem.
-Oh, you do?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.560
Let me show you.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.240
Well, just be thankful
I didn't read it to you on a gondola.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.040
What's all this?

04:58.200 --> 05:01.520
Breakfast. Popped down to the shop
when you were out.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.240
-That's nice of you.
-Well, more self-serving than nice.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.880
I saw the state of your fridge
last time I was here.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.600
Domestic skills aren't my strong suit.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.560
I noticed.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Thank you.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.840
Mine. Yours.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.240
Uncontaminated by my bacon, don't worry.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.120
Great.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.560
Bon appétit.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.400
Some beans there as well,
if you want them.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.840
Hello?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.880
We... we lost the Juno, Charlie.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.880
What? What do you mean, "lost"?

06:08.040 --> 06:11.600
The emergency beacon.
It was picked up late last night.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.840
Charlie, are you there?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.840
I'm here. We just spoke to them, how...

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
What...

06:33.160 --> 06:35.480
Two other emergency beacons
were picked up.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.880
From fishing trawlers in the same area.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.920
The Norwegian Coast Guard are there.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.200
Looking for them.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.000
Do they think anyone got off
before it went down?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.080
I'll let you know
as soon as we know more.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.880
As soon as we find them.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.720
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.400
Vibrio vulnificus ?

09:12.560 --> 09:17.400
It's a bacterium which produces a toxin
when it comes into contact with blood.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.400
Usually through an open wound
from handling or eating

09:21.640 --> 09:23.840
raw seafood harvested in warm water.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.760
-It's most common in the Gulf of Mexico.
-So we know what it is?

09:30.080 --> 09:31.480
Yes. Yes.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
But?

09:36.240 --> 09:39.320
Our blood contains cells
which consume the Vibrio ,

09:39.480 --> 09:41.840
which is why an infection
is so rarely fatal.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.400
But in this case... C'mon, have a look.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.200
The Vibrio is consuming the blood.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.600
At an astonishing rate.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.600
Yeah, it must be
some kind of mutation, or...

09:56.760 --> 09:58.480
or a new strain.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.320
We are lucky
no one else has contracted it.

10:04.320 --> 10:08.200
There have been other people infected.
I just heard this morning.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.400
-Where?
-At a restaurant up the coast.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.400
None of them survived.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.360
It's got a D-shaped shell,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.560
alternating yellow and brownish stripes
of a zebra mussel,

10:26.720 --> 10:28.720
two hinged valves joined by a ligament.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.880
But adults are typically
fingernail-sized.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.200
This is twice as large.

10:36.040 --> 10:40.320
-But mussels can't swim, can they?
-They can in the larval stage.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.040
Which is how they must have found

10:42.200 --> 10:44.520
and attached themselves
to the Barrier Queen.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.160
The ship left on the second,
and arrived eighteen days later.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.400
By which time, there were tens,
maybe hundreds of thousands of them.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.360
No species of mussels
can reproduce at that rate.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.880
I'll send a sample for sequencing
to the bio lab at the university.

10:59.040 --> 11:04.000
That should tell us whether
it's a mutation or a new species.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.520
Dr. Oliviera, what is this?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.800
It appears to be
some sort of organic material.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.520
Can you run a test?

11:15.680 --> 11:16.760
Sure, Leon.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.400
I'll add it to the list of other 9,000
things I have to do today.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.120
Anything else?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.560
Actually, there is.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.360
I'd like to do an autopsy
on the orca at the beach.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.520
I thought you said
it died from its wounds?

11:30.680 --> 11:33.080
It attacked a boat
for no apparent reason.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.760
So did the whale
which attacked the Lady Wexham,

11:35.920 --> 11:38.120
and the tugboats
towing the Barrier Queen into harbor.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.280
I want to see if there's a contaminant
load impacting the whales' behavior.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.480
-Leon, we're short-staffed as it is.
-I can do it myself.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.600
You've never done
an autopsy in the field.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.320
But there's gotta be a first time, right?

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
I can ask a couple of the grads
to help out.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.560
Get them out of the lab,
out of your hair?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.760
Sure an orca's big enough
for your first time?

11:59.920 --> 12:03.760
-No problem.
-Fine. But they are your responsibility.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.960
He had some plastic in his gut,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.640
but his stomach or bowels
were free from any obstructions.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.040
-You took tissue samples?
-We did.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.640
We ran an analysis
to check traces of contaminants, PCBs...

12:27.800 --> 12:29.400
-Infections?
-None.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.640
His wounds were deep,
but they were clean.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
I'll run a full range
of blood tests to make sure.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.000
But I did find something
I've never seen.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.960
A small clot in the brain stem.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.640
A blood clot?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.240
Not blood.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.360
Any damage to the brain?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.680
-Any sign of a stroke?
-None.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.720
Any idea what it is?

12:59.960 --> 13:02.840
It looks like
something growing into the brain tissue.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.520
Maybe like a fungus.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.560
And yes, I will add it
to the list of tests you want me to run.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.440
Go ahead, go ahead. Stop.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
Okay.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.400
Hey!

14:10.280 --> 14:12.000
What the hell?

15:29.440 --> 15:31.200
Twelve more cases came in this morning.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.320
Anyone who ate or touched a lobster?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.720
No, or any shellfish at all.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.640
-It must be airborne.
-No, no, no, it can't be airborne.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.480
If it were, we'd be seeing
a lot more cases.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.680
Then how?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.920
-The garbage disposal.
-Sorry?

15:55.480 --> 15:59.920
The mae d' in the restaurant said the
lobster went down the garbage disposal.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.000
The Vibrio vulnificus ...

16:05.760 --> 16:07.600
it's in the water system.

16:10.280 --> 16:14.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
we ask you to remain calm.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.640
We are here and will...

16:25.680 --> 16:27.960
-You're sending them where?
- To Corbigny.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.560
I... we need to get them away
from the coast. From the water.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.920
-Is there anybody at the house?
- No.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.080
As I can't leave, I'm asking you
to meet them there. Okay?

16:38.920 --> 16:41.520
C飩le, look.
I know that you're concerned...

16:41.680 --> 16:43.760
- Don't do that, Michael.
-Don't do what?

16:45.320 --> 16:47.240
Tell me I'm overreacting.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.520
Is it really necessary?
That's all I'm saying.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.280
-Why don't they come here?
-You're not safe either.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.080
That's what I'm trying to say.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.880
We don't know how far,
how fast it's spreading,

16:59.040 --> 17:03.080
and can't, until people
start getting sick and dying.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.200
-When are they leaving?
-I'm packing the car now.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.360
Okay.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.320
-You'll go?
-Yeah. I'll go.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.240
The Wi-Fi better be working.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.880
No promises.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.520
Thank you, Michael.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.000
If you have to stop,
don't use tap water at all.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.200
Okay? Only use disinfectant
and bottled water.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.200
Understood?
When you get there, boil some water.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.040
-No showers, no baths.
-But I don't even have a license.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.560
-What if the cops stop us?
-They won't. Plus, you drive very well.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.600
And Dad is on his way,
he'll meet you at the house.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.240
Okay? Don't worry, he'll be there.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.840
When will you get there, too?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
As soon as I can, sweetheart.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.280
Be nice to your sister
and help her, okay?

18:04.440 --> 18:07.320
I have Maps on my phone
in case she gets lost.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.840
Okay, go.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.800
Are you really coming?

18:18.040 --> 18:20.160
-Or are you just saying it?
-Of course I will.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.880
Come here.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.920
Call me as soon as you get there.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.840
-Okay.
-Promise?

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
Come on.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.600
-I love you, Louis.
-Love you, Mum.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.840
I love you, Isabelle.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.360
Love you too.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.200
Dr. Johanson?
Mr. Sato is ready for you, sir.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.640
Wonderful.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.200
Mr. Sato, thank you for taking the time.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.160
Please.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.480
-May I offer you something?
-No, no, I'm good, thank you.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.120
So when did you arrive?

19:39.280 --> 19:41.800
-Just this morning.
-Are you here for the conference?

19:41.960 --> 19:45.600
No, no.
But I understand you'll be speaking?

19:46.440 --> 19:51.720
"The Transformative Power of Science
in the Wake of the Global Pandemic."

19:52.680 --> 19:55.320
For which I have been allocated
thirty minutes.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.320
Including questions, if there are any.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.000
I wasn't aware that Mr. Mifune
was interested in medical technology.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.640
It's a recent development.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.560
An offshoot of his interest
in environmental biotechnology.

20:16.320 --> 20:20.240
I understand from Ms. Lund that
you have something of interest to us?

20:20.400 --> 20:21.720
I do.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.480
I was hoping that
you might have something

20:26.240 --> 20:27.680
of interest to us.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.240
-If this proves relevant.
-I understand.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.400
If you could just send that along
sooner rather than later.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.200
Of course.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.920
It's a challenging time.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.360
It is.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.800
Particularly for those
with shipping interests.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.920
The jellyfish in the Adriatic,

20:54.080 --> 20:56.920
the disruption caused
by the whale attacks in the Pacific.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.800
The Barrier Queen is one of yours, yeah?

21:04.280 --> 21:08.800
Not mine. One of Mr. Mifune's.
I run Mr. Mifune's foundation.

21:10.360 --> 21:15.240
Mr. Mifune's other interests
are outside my area of concern.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.920
-But you know that.
-Well, I've done my research.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.760
Is it true about the Barrier Queen?

21:26.720 --> 21:30.720
That a couple of whales attacked
the tugboats sent out to save it?

21:32.400 --> 21:34.560
That's what's been reported.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.280
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
My assistant can show you out.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.800
No, I'm sure I can find my way.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.840
-Thank you, again, for taking the time.
-It was my pleasure.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.520
Is it the same species?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.840
If you look at the images and compare
the worms found in the Norwegian Sea

22:20.080 --> 22:23.360
with the ones we discovered,
you'll see they're a bit larger,

22:23.520 --> 22:28.840
but have the same articulated jaws,
same sharp, elongated teeth.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.080
So yes, I'd say
they're the same species.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.120
How serious a threat do they pose?

22:39.600 --> 22:42.960
The blow-out on the Thorvaldson
could be a freak accident,

22:43.200 --> 22:47.600
but we should keep ships clear of the
area where the ice worms were found.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.360
Aside from Hovedstad,
who else knows about them?

22:51.520 --> 22:54.120
It is just a matter of time
before word gets out.

22:55.320 --> 23:00.480
The question is, whose interests
is Dr. Johanson protecting?

23:01.840 --> 23:06.840
He doesn't work for Hovedstad,
if that's what you're asking.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.640
So he says.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.840
I have no reason not to believe him.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.840
Nor do I, but I think
it would be prudent to find out.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.520
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.880
-How'd it go?
-As expected.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.600
-But you saw Riku Sato?
-Oh, I did.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.920
I did. He was charming,
couldn't have been more gracious.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.600
-This one's good?
-Yeah.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.200
Whether or not he'll help us...
who knows.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.840
If it's in his interest to do so,
he will.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.680
And you think it's in his interest?

23:53.400 --> 23:57.280
Aito Mifune invested in the biotreatment
of polluted environments,

23:57.520 --> 24:00.400
including the ocean,
before anyone was even talking about it.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.800
Right, right.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.200
Well, you know,

24:03.360 --> 24:06.920
saving the world is every billionaire's
favorite pastime, right?

24:07.160 --> 24:09.560
Long as it doesn't trim the bottom line.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.200
It is possible to do both, you know.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.760
-Do good and make money?
-Yeah.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.120
Right. I mean, the man's a saint.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.880
I didn't say that.
You're not being fair.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.440
Maybe I'm not. No, you're right.
Can we talk about something else?

24:28.600 --> 24:32.240
-Sigur, I'm trying to help.
-I know you are, and I appreciate it.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.520
So why are you being so...

24:34.680 --> 24:36.360
-So what?
-So difficult!

24:39.760 --> 24:41.240
'Cause I...

24:45.720 --> 24:47.680
'Cause I shouldn't be here.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.440
With you. Alone.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.520
But I am.

24:56.600 --> 25:00.440
From the moment you called,
from the moment I saw you, I...

25:00.960 --> 25:04.600
just knew this was going to happen,
because I want this to happen.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.840
And now I'm sitting here...

25:08.760 --> 25:10.840
across from you, and I...

25:11.840 --> 25:14.400
I can't think about anything else.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.160
So.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.920
I need to know: When you called me,
was it just about work?

25:28.960 --> 25:34.080
I wanted your advice, Sigur.
Because I knew you would give it.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.000
And it would be honest.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.480
Fair.

25:38.760 --> 25:42.480
And it would make me, or us,
Hovedstad, listen.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
Yeah.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.600
That doesn't mean
that I didn't want to see you again.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.240
Excuse me, can I have the check, please?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.800
-I'm going to bed.
-Good night.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.320
They found the Juno, Charlie.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.600
Did they find anyone?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
No.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.480
They think everyone was still on board
when she went down.

28:22.720 --> 28:26.200
Professor Lehmann approved the mission
to find out what happened.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.200
If they find anything,
they'll send us the footage.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.800
I'm coming.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.560
-Charlie...
- They're our friends. I want...

28:41.400 --> 28:43.280
I need to be there with you.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.240
What's all this?

29:24.400 --> 29:26.920
We've been discussing
the reports of the whale attacks.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.680
This is the location
of the attack on the Lady Wexham.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.600
And these are the locations of the
other attacks in the Northwest Pacific.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.920
We're just trying to figure out

29:36.080 --> 29:38.440
if there's a common factor
that links them all.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.400
-Is it okay if I...
-Yeah, of course.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.200
I should have seen it before.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.240
This is the migration route.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.400
All the attacks are happening along it.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.000
So if something's affecting the whales,

30:21.800 --> 30:25.480
it's happening sometime,
somewhere, during the migration.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.160
-They're asleep, right?
-Yes.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.800
-All of them?
-Yes.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.000
-For how long?
-Fifteen minutes, tops.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.720
I can't believe I agreed to this.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.440
Come on, kid.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.160
-Shit.
-What?

33:06.400 --> 33:08.360
-They're waking up.
-How many?

33:09.480 --> 33:12.200
-All of them.
-That's just great.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.760
Start the engine.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.240
C'mon!

35:00.040 --> 35:01.240
Hello?

35:01.400 --> 35:04.840
-Dr. Johanson, this is Riku Sato.
-Mr. Sato.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.640
In response to the act of faith
you extended to us,

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
I am extending the same to you.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.560
You've found the worms?

35:14.720 --> 35:17.240
- We have, yes.
-Where?

35:17.400 --> 35:20.240
On the continental slope
of the southeast coast of India,

35:20.400 --> 35:23.280
the Nankai Trough
and the South Chinese Sea.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.160
-How widespread are they?
- I'll forward you what we have.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.200
There's something else
I'd like to ask you.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.760
Of course.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.000
The permit Hovedstad was granted
by the Norwegian government

35:36.160 --> 35:40.360
for exploration of oil,
gas hydrates, minerals.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.520
Yeah?

35:42.280 --> 35:44.120
Did Ms. Lund show it to you?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.640
No, she did not.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.640
Can I ask you why you're asking this?

35:54.560 --> 35:56.840
Perhaps I can send you something?

35:58.440 --> 36:01.280
-Please do.
- I'll have it sent over shortly.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.840
I won't take up any more of your time.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.240
The ship on the left
with the trench cutters is for dredging.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.200
The one on the right is for processing
material they bring up from the seabed.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.680
-Can you get any closer?
-They might engage if we do.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.880
Risers that size, they'll be bringing up

36:34.040 --> 36:37.240
8,000, 10,000 metric tons
per ship per day.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.720
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.080
I spoke to Riku Sato.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.880
And they found the worms.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.000
-Where?
-South China Sea.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.160
South coast of India,
off the Nankai Trough.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.640
But they didn't find them on top of
the shelf, they found them on the slope,

37:20.240 --> 37:23.400
which could destabilize the hydrates
quicker than we thought,

37:23.560 --> 37:26.800
so we should get back out there
to see how far they spread.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.600
We have some really fresh tuna
in the kitchen.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.080
I was going to do
a little tartare for the staff.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.320
Do you want some?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.800
-Yes, thanks.
-Salad?

37:37.960 --> 37:39.560
-Please.
-Yes.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.960
Sorry about that, Sigur.

37:44.120 --> 37:49.200
No, it's alright.
Do you want to talk some other time?

37:49.360 --> 37:52.240
No, no, it's fine.

37:53.640 --> 37:58.760
Yeah. Could you send me a map of
all the areas you've surveyed to date?

37:58.920 --> 38:02.280
So I can narrow down the area
we might wanna visit again?

38:02.440 --> 38:04.280
Yeah, as soon as
I get back to the office.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.960
So, what else did Sato say?

38:11.760 --> 38:15.320
Nothing. Nothing we didn't already know.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.600
Fine.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.960
I'll clear it with Skaugen.
We can head out tomorrow.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.320
Thank you.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.960
Look, Sigur...

38:32.280 --> 38:33.800
About Geneva...

38:34.640 --> 38:37.560
Hey, let's just talk when we get back.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.160
Sure.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.640
Here you go.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.600
That was close.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.440
Why do you do this to yourself?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
What?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.640
Work like this.

39:26.240 --> 39:31.840
-Can't you stop and enjoy things?
-I'm already doing that, Kare.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.320
Everybody is always
so focused on the future.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.120
Preparing, making plans.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.760
The way things are going,
who the hell knows what that will be.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.880
Or if there even is a future.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
So I just say: Fuck it.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.760
Live in the moment.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.040
The world is going to do what it wants.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.800
We only get one life.
May as well enjoy it.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.400
Max?

41:53.760 --> 41:58.480
-Max? Can you get the door?
-I'm half-naked, could you go, please?

42:44.800 --> 42:47.240
We received the footage from the ROV.

42:48.800 --> 42:53.240
I know you were all very close,
so if you'd rather not watch...

42:54.360 --> 42:56.320
I want to know what happened.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.080
You're sure?

43:03.600 --> 43:05.040
I am.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.920
Let's see what they found.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.280
-How'd it go?
-I got it.

43:16.440 --> 43:19.040
-No problems?
-Took me right to it.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.600
Do they usually dive this deep?

45:00.120 --> 45:01.120
No.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.000
Never.
