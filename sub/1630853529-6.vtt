WEBVTT

00:15.641 --> 00:17.351
- Isn't this great?

00:17.435 --> 00:19.520
I'm so glad you guys let me
talk you into a beach day.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.147
Mm-hmm. Yep.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.025
Yo, fuck the beach!

00:25.109 --> 00:28.112
I don't know what's worse,
these Off-Brian dipshits

00:28.195 --> 00:30.781
or the sand tanking
the resale value of my Air Max.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.701
- Ah, first rule of
beach club, Benny.
- Ugh.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.745
Ditch the shoes
and let the dogs out.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.373
No offense, Dale,
but anyone who's able to

00:39.457 --> 00:40.875
enjoy the beach after
what we've done to it

00:40.958 --> 00:43.043
- is honestly trash.
- Ow, ow! Put me down, bitch.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.837
Just give it a chance.
Check it out.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.088
I'm thinking first
we fly kites,

00:46.172 --> 00:47.173
and then boogie boarding,

00:47.256 --> 00:48.257
quick break for
an ice cream sando--

00:48.340 --> 00:49.925
maybe two
if we're feeling naughty--

00:50.009 --> 00:51.594
wait an hour for our tums
to settle,

00:51.677 --> 00:53.304
then build sandcastles
and discuss how to be

00:53.387 --> 00:54.972
responsible sandcastle owners.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.682
That sounds dope as hell.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.017
That's the spirit, Tru!

00:58.100 --> 01:00.603
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, my God!

01:00.686 --> 01:04.190
Cerise, babe, that's so funny.

01:04.273 --> 01:07.610
- I'm for real,
you gotta try TikTok.
- Ugh.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.570
Okay, okay, now, I know what
you're all wondering,

01:09.653 --> 01:11.405
and the answer is yes.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.032
I did stay up all night
making these.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.993
Whoa, baby, I gotta
call you back.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.912
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?!

01:17.953 --> 01:20.623
<i>Breaking news, Fair-binches!</i>

01:20.706 --> 01:24.960
<i>After being out-sold</i>

01:25.044 --> 01:27.338

01:38.307 --> 01:39.892

01:39.975 --> 01:42.436
<i>it looks like a permanent</i>

01:42.520 --> 01:46.398

01:46.482 --> 01:48.317
- No!
- This is a mistake!

01:48.400 --> 01:50.653
Someone's clearly
Britney-Spearsing Hiroki.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.279
Damn, bro. No cap?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.365
Think about it.
Brian's fuckin' savage.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.033
He probably chloroformed him

01:56.116 --> 01:58.035
and kidnapped his ass
in the middle of the night.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.704
Or maybe he's just taking
a radical sabbatical.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.832
Hiroki working on Hiroki
could be a good thing.

02:02.915 --> 02:06.460
Look, Brian's one fire drop
away from taking over Fairfax.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.004
If we don't bust Hiroki out now,

02:09.088 --> 02:10.297
he could lose the block forever.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.966
Aw, geez, I-I don't know, guys.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.176
We told my Dad we'd stay close
to this lifeguard tower.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.053
Yo, Grant can suck it, Dale.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Hiroki's probably in
a straightjacket,

02:18.222 --> 02:19.932
drugged up on God knows what,

02:20.015 --> 02:22.101
lying in a puddle of
his own piss right now.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.270
Cerise says Clout Nine
is right up the coast.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.354
Ten minutes by foot.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.939
Two if we kayak.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.526
We're going
to Clout Nine, aren't we?

02:47.543 --> 02:49.628
Yo,
it's like a Four Seasons

02:49.712 --> 02:51.380
fucked a psych ward.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.679
Sick.
Yo, they have an infinity pool

02:58.762 --> 03:00.639
that actually stretches out
into infinity.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.182
Isn't that just the ocean?

03:02.266 --> 03:04.685
<i>Hi, we're the Seans of Sunset.</i>

03:04.768 --> 03:06.145
<i>And something we've learned</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:09.773

<i>a little differently.</i>

03:09.857 --> 03:12.276

03:17.615 --> 03:19.950

<i>panic at the disco</i>

<i>- we're here for you.</i>

03:24.997 --> 03:26.498
<i>Now come on in</i>

03:26.582 --> 03:29.168
<i>and say "no mo" to FOMO.</i>

03:29.251 --> 03:30.586
Look, this place is massive,

03:30.669 --> 03:32.713
so we got to split up
to cover more ground.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.923
Ready?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.382
- Break!

03:35.466 --> 03:37.051
Hey, D,

03:37.134 --> 03:38.552
do you think that Hiroki

03:38.636 --> 03:41.180
could be
at that swim-up smoothie bar?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.265
'Cause I think that maybe
we should check that out.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.642
Totally. And if we discover

03:44.725 --> 03:46.310
after
having thoroughly investigated

03:46.393 --> 03:48.354
that delicious situation
that he's not there,

03:48.437 --> 03:51.982
we should check
the Eucalyptus Steam Jungle.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.817
Mr. Hiroki?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.736
Mr. Hiroki Hassan?

03:55.819 --> 03:57.571
Just because
it's important to you

03:57.655 --> 03:59.823
doesn't mean
it needs to be a podcast.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.450
- Repeat your mantra.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.827
No one cares, and that's okay.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.580
No one cares,
and that's okay...

04:08.207 --> 04:10.501
Wait a second,
wait a second. Dale?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.505
Hey, Cody. Wow. I...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.966
- How'd you know it was me?
- Oh, I smelled

04:17.049 --> 04:18.676
your Johnson & Johnson
No More Tears baby shampoo

04:18.759 --> 04:20.094
from down the hall.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.887
Look at that, no tears.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.515
Ugh, I cannot believe
you came to surprise me

04:24.598 --> 04:26.141
like this. Dude, seriously?

04:26.225 --> 04:27.559
Above and beyond.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.269
Right, of course.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.356
What, uh...
What are you doing here?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.943
To be honest, that Lily breakup
really did a number on me.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.779
I realized I needed to face
my prank addiction head-on,

04:38.862 --> 04:40.906
one post at a time.

04:40.990 --> 04:42.533
Well, it works
if you work it, right?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.493
- I'm glad you're finding peace.
- Hey, you want to hear

04:44.576 --> 04:45.953
something super unchill,
li'l fawn?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.162
Is it cool if I call you that?

04:47.246 --> 04:48.706
You remind me
of, like, a li'l baby fawn.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.833
Sure, I guess.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.418
Cubby and Shu haven't visited me

04:52.501 --> 04:55.421
or donated to the ACLU once
since I left.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.339
They also slid into Lily's DMs

04:57.423 --> 04:59.675
the same day I checked in.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.010
So much for The Triangle.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.512
Ay-ay-ay.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.680
That does seem pretty tough.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.223
Anyhoo,
glad to see you're doing well,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.225
- and best luck
with the speedy recovery.
- No,

05:08.308 --> 05:10.185
come on. You leaving so soon?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.854
Whale watching?

05:11.937 --> 05:13.397
Sandcastles?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.773
Rock climbing.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.442
Bingo.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.528
Actually, you know what?
Eff that.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.739
No child left behind.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.158
You know what always helps me
when I need to clear my mind?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.993
Uh, you have my attention.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.828
The beach.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.663
Specifically, those activities

05:29.747 --> 05:31.373
listed on the board
right over there.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.627
Oh, goddamn, li'l fawn. I'm in.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.136
Whoa!

05:47.222 --> 05:50.434
Goddamn lingering baby fat.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.063
Oh, shit, Yung Polluter?

05:54.146 --> 05:55.355
On the ground.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.358
No. In the trash can.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.738
- Hiroki's midday dose,
coming up.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.283
I knew he was being Britney-ed.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.375
Oh, fuck me.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.847
Oh!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.813
Ooh. Mmm.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.693
You won't get away with this!

06:41.777 --> 06:42.778
What's going on?!

06:42.861 --> 06:44.863
Oh, I-I-I... I'm-I'm so sorry.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.448
I-I thought
you were Hiroki Hassan.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.159
Bitch, I am Hiroki Hassan!

06:50.369 --> 06:52.663
Now announce the drop.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.460
Yes, my darling.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.969
All right,
where my humpbacks at?

07:08.679 --> 07:11.014
- I miss her
so much, man.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.433
It's like there's
a Lily-sized hole in my heart

07:13.517 --> 07:15.018
that I need to fill up.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.895
- Hey, could you do me a solid?

07:16.979 --> 07:18.230
What's up, Cody?

07:18.313 --> 07:19.773
Could we do the <i>Titanic</i>
for a few minutes?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.608
It's something
Lily and I used to do,

07:21.692 --> 07:24.194
and you have
the same exact body type.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.446
Consider it, like,
your charitable component.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.532
You know, I just don't think
that's such a good idea.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.451
Nah. Nah, nah, that's cool.
We don't have to.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.078
I'll just list
all the things I miss about her

07:33.162 --> 07:34.246
in alphabetical order.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.873
Abs. Brie cheese,

07:35.956 --> 07:37.583
because
she's lactose intolerant.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.418
Cats. Dad,

07:39.501 --> 07:42.171
because I sent her dad
into anaphylactic shock.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.464
Okay, okay, we can <i>Titanic.</i>
But for the love of God,

07:44.548 --> 07:46.175
you got to stop talking
about Lily.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.343
- And I get to be Jack.
- No.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.847
- No, you're not, li'l fawn.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.933
I'm the king of the world!

07:55.017 --> 07:58.103
And you're my queen, li'l fawn.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.857
Look, I'm sure
whoever's keeping you here

08:01.940 --> 08:03.567
is spying on our convo,
so I'm gonna make it quick.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.652
My friends and I are
gonna bust you out.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.321
Blink once if you understand.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.324
Boy, I checked myself
into Clout Nine.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.409
Blink once if you understand.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.662
Oh, I get it.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.497
This is a publicity stunt.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.499
Like Kanye finding God.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.586
I can assure you,
little Dorito Boy,

08:22.669 --> 08:25.130
this is no publicity stunt.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.924
I'm quitting fashion.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.092
No!

08:29.176 --> 08:32.012
If you're in here dropping syrup
instead of box tees,

08:32.095 --> 08:33.639
Latrine loses its hype,

08:33.722 --> 08:36.225
and I lose what
little fucking clout I have.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.727
Off-Brian is dissing
the House of Latrine!

08:38.810 --> 08:40.646
You got to clap back
at this bitch.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.898
Clapping back is
my second favorite thing to do

08:42.981 --> 08:47.110
after initiating the diss
that precedes the clapback.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.280
Unfortunately,
that's no longer possible

08:50.364 --> 08:53.075
because I've lost my mojo.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.494
So, you're a little down. BFD.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.246
You haven't missed a drop
since '94.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.705
Fucking 9/11 happened,

08:58.789 --> 09:00.707
and you dropped a bucket hat
that Thursday.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.709
That bucket hat
healed the nation.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.879
Look,
I can't go back to Fairfax.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.547
What? Wh-Why not?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.633
Ugh, you really want to know?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.219
Fine. I'll show you.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.639
What is this?!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.808
Where are we?!

09:19.309 --> 09:21.478
"I Feel Good"]

09:33.198 --> 09:35.158
- Hey!

09:41.873 --> 09:43.500
- Uh-huh.
- Hey.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.838
Click, click.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.006
Click, click.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.967
But it only lives in my mind.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.761
That's just sad, bruh.
Some people got issues.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.555
What took you so long?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.890
Your gazpacho heated back up
into a regular-ass soup.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.684
Sorry, D.
Uh, Cerise caught a nasty virus,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.144
so I popped
into the business center

10:02.227 --> 10:03.687
just to make sure that
she's getting enough charge.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.731
- You know.
- Oh, speaking of Cerise,

10:05.814 --> 10:09.234
uh, how's your, uh...
your thing going?

10:09.318 --> 10:12.154
- Bruh, it's so good. Like,

10:12.237 --> 10:14.948
she's so smart
and cool and curious.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.616
Like, I went downstairs to get
a bowl of cereal this morning,

10:16.700 --> 10:19.870
and when I came back,
she had four master's degrees.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.830
Tight. Okay.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.415
Yeah. I'm just asking

10:23.498 --> 10:25.250
'cause, you know,
she catfished you

10:25.334 --> 10:27.002
and tried to sell you
a bunch of fruit snacks

10:27.085 --> 10:28.754
and then broke your heart
into a million little pieces.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.422
So sweet that you care.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.424
But things are different
this time, you know?

10:32.507 --> 10:33.884
She completely cut ties
with Big Juice,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.510
so we're past all that.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.095
Everybody's got baggage.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.889
Hers is just a little juicier.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.099
For real, things are good.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.185
Things are so good that...

10:43.268 --> 10:46.355
I lost my SIM card to Cerise.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.647
Jah feel?

10:47.731 --> 10:49.024
- Huh?

10:49.107 --> 10:52.486
My hardware. Her software.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.322
Let's just say I had to put her
in a bowl of rice

10:55.405 --> 10:56.698
when we was finished.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.284
- Oh, shit.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.583
Honestly, Lily loved my pranks.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
I'd be like, "I love you."

11:08.251 --> 11:10.921
"JK! Emotional prank."

11:11.004 --> 11:13.673
Which is why it's so confusing
that she broke up with me.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.176
Maybe
you're remembering it wrong.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.511
I don't know anyone

11:17.594 --> 11:19.388
who would enjoy
an emotional prank like that.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whose side are you on?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.850
Oh, yours, of course.
I'm just...

11:23.934 --> 11:26.770
I'm trying to keep it real
with the big fawn, you know?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.647
And that's why I like you,
li'l fawn.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.732
And, hey,
since we're best friends now,

11:30.816 --> 11:32.609
can I be honest with you?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.737
'Cause I've got a secret that's
been weighing me down for days.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.740
I don't have a pranking problem!

11:38.824 --> 11:40.617
- Booyah!
- Are you serious?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.911
Serious as that ketchup stain
on your shirt.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.621
- Gah. Really? Where?
- Bloop!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.123
- Gah.
- You see?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.583
I told you
I don't have a problemo.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.502
It's just some bullshit
I told Lily.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.421
The truth is
I'm only here to show her

11:52.504 --> 11:54.673
that I'm working on myself--
yeah, okay--

11:54.756 --> 11:57.134
so that she'll get back together
with me.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.302
I guess you could say
this whole stint at Clout Nine

11:59.386 --> 12:02.222
- was a classic
Cody prankeroonie.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.765
- Uh-oh, hold on. Light bulb!

12:03.849 --> 12:06.059
In my head. Doy, Dale,

12:06.143 --> 12:07.644
since you know so much
about Lily,

12:07.727 --> 12:10.230
you can help me get her back.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.440
- No.
- Yes!

12:11.523 --> 12:13.024
Thank you, brother.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.902
- Oh, man,
I feel so much better now.

12:15.986 --> 12:19.072
That's strange,
because I feel so much worse.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.618
Where are we?

12:23.702 --> 12:25.954
My memory château

12:26.037 --> 12:28.665
where all my memories live.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.014
Damn, that's
a good-looking jacket, playboi.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.725
- Birds Wearhouse up on 57th?
- You know it.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.102
Give me some wing,
give me some wing.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.146
Yeah. Hey,

12:51.229 --> 12:52.939
I found a loaf of focaccia
in the bathroom.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.192
You want to do a bump
of breadcrumbs? Huh?

12:58.737 --> 13:00.822
Is this a memory?

13:00.906 --> 13:02.908
It's
the pre-memory dance party.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.910
An amalgamation
of all the best parties

13:04.993 --> 13:07.287
- I've ever been to.
- Oh.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.206
I'm going to show you
the history of Latrine,

13:09.289 --> 13:12.042
and then you'll understand
why I have to move on.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.793
Yoink!
Yum.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.420
You shouldn't have done that.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.724
Ugh, you got to give me
some warning next time.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.019
No way! You worked
at a Lady Foot Locker?

13:31.102 --> 13:33.730
It was the '90s! Now shush.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.565
And watch.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.611
Hiroki,
I hired you to sell Reeboks,

13:39.694 --> 13:41.655
- not turn them into dresses.
- But, sir...

13:41.738 --> 13:43.990
Bup, bup, bup, no "buts."
Take them down.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.992
And what have I told you
about wearing a cape to work,

13:46.076 --> 13:47.452
- huh?

13:47.536 --> 13:49.829
Oh, boomshakalaka.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.957
Ugh. Brian?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.584
It's both highbrow
and lowbrow, and...

13:54.668 --> 13:58.755
oh, my God, you combined
the brows into a unibrow.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.591
My name is Brian,
and it would be an honor

14:01.675 --> 14:05.595
to be your henchman,
Hiroki Hassan.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.974
I'm sorry, I don't think
designers have henchmen.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.809
They do now, my liege.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.229
This was the beginning
of my creative partnership

14:14.312 --> 14:15.605
with Brian.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.276
He saw something in me
before anyone else did.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.030
June '93.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.116
The first week at the lair.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.743
That's when we decided
on the name.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.829
We shall call it Latrine.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.080
Latrine!

14:32.163 --> 14:36.126
Yes, it must be Latrine.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.336
Brian came up with Latrine?

14:38.420 --> 14:41.756
- Wise as ever, my liege.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.303
Six months later,

14:46.386 --> 14:50.056
we settled
on our first brick-and-mortar.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.934
- Holy shit. Phyllis was hot?!
- The property's

14:53.018 --> 14:55.520
- been abandoned for years.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.856
It's next to a Jewish deli
and a smoke shop.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.357
Yes, Fairfax.

14:59.441 --> 15:03.653
This is where our empire
will lay rest.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.367
- Bastille Day, '94.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.037
Latrine's first drop.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.039
The original box logo tee?

15:14.122 --> 15:17.167
Don't tell me that was Brian,
too.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.337
No. Say it ain't so.

15:20.420 --> 15:24.049
Perfect, Brian. Now release it!

15:35.852 --> 15:38.605
I checked into Clout Nine
the next day.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.398
Now you know the truth.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.068
Without Brian,
Latrine is nothing.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.696
Without Brian, I am nothing.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.993
But without you, I'm nothing.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.996
Not my problem, kid.
Now leave me alone

15:55.080 --> 15:58.750
so I can go eat a four-pound bag
of Haribo gummies.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.462
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm just thinking, like,</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:03.797
one or two kids?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.924
I guess it depends
on where we end up, right?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.842
- Ugh.
- Maybe
upstate New York?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.345
Then again, Cerise prefers
the schools in Connecticut.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.431
Tru, I'm sorry,
but upstate New York?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.141
Connecticut? I mean,
what are you saying?

16:15.225 --> 16:16.601
You've never even been
to Connecticut.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.771
And kids? Come on.
How is that even possible?

16:19.854 --> 16:22.357
We narrowed it down
to either surrogacy or adoption.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.734
You know she's not real, right?
She's a computer.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.486
First of all,
she's not a computer.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.863
She's a billion dollars' worth
of experimental marketing tech.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.365
And second of all,
she's my girlfriend.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.158
- Seriously, D.

16:32.242 --> 16:35.286
Out of all people.
You're Miss Love Is Love.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.830
Aah! That is not what it means!

16:36.913 --> 16:38.373
Well, what about you
and Melody, huh?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.916
Playing <i>You've Got Mail</i>
over the phone.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.252
Have you even had a conversation
in real life?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.795
There hasn't been a right time.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.964
- And, plus, that's different.
- How?

16:46.047 --> 16:47.674
Because Melody
is a human person!

16:47.757 --> 16:50.885
Why can't you
just be happy for me?

16:50.969 --> 16:52.804
Shit.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.514
You're right.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.434
I'm sorry, Tru. I was
just trying to protect you,

16:57.517 --> 17:00.103
but if you're happy, I'm happy.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.693
Finally, Kitey.

17:06.776 --> 17:11.156
It's just you, me
and the sweet Santa Ana winds.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.283
- No!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.910
Listen, Dale,
we've got a huge problem.

17:15.994 --> 17:18.037
Hiroki is off the deep end
and, as much as I hate this,

17:18.121 --> 17:19.914
I think the only way
to fix Hiroki

17:19.998 --> 17:22.125
is to get him back together
with Brian.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.960
So, I'm gonna need
your internship contacts,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.963
- your fanny
and your leftover chloroform.
- Did you ever think

17:27.046 --> 17:28.381
that maybe you shouldn't be
trying to get two people

17:28.465 --> 17:30.341
back together who don't want
to get back together?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.802
Not everyone is supposed
to be together forever, Benny.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.053
Especially
if there might be, like,

17:34.137 --> 17:35.722
another person
who is way more compatible

17:35.805 --> 17:37.807
and who, I don't know, geez,
maybe knows how to treat a lady

17:37.891 --> 17:40.560
and thinks pranks aren't all
that great in the first place!

17:40.643 --> 17:42.103
- Damn, Dale.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.439
That's a lot of pent-up rage.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.566
- You a'ight?
- No, Benny!

17:46.649 --> 17:49.903
I'm not a'ight. In fact,
I-I'm the opposite of a'ight.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.654
Today was supposed to be
my beach day,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.198
but instead we're here,
hanging out

17:53.281 --> 17:55.116
with a bunch
of clout-thirsty turd burgers.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.786
And I don't know, maybe I'm
just reading into it too much,

17:57.869 --> 17:59.788
but it feels like whenever
I want to do something,

17:59.871 --> 18:02.040
the gang gang
does the exact opposite.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.503
Holy shit, Dale.
You're a goddamn genius.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.254
I'm really sorry
you feel that way,

18:08.338 --> 18:10.006
and we're totally gonna
unpack this

18:10.089 --> 18:11.466
over Trini's
slipper cobbler later,

18:11.549 --> 18:13.384
but-but I got to go.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.055
Oh, there you are, my boy.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.140
So,
Operation Trick Lily Via Dale?

18:19.224 --> 18:20.642
It's a go, baby.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.060
I'm thinking long game.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.978
You befriend her
and build trust.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.563
You go to the movies,
dinners, maybe even dates.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.190
You become a part of her life.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.441
She tells you
all of her secrets.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.776
Then, two to five years later,

18:29.859 --> 18:31.069
we throw her a birthday party

18:31.152 --> 18:32.946
where you pull the rug out
from under her.

18:33.029 --> 18:36.616
She hates you. But there I am,
cloaked in soft fabrics.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.077
You touch them,
it makes you shiver.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.289
I am absolutely yoked
from head to toes. And boom!

18:43.373 --> 18:44.624
We elope to Fiji.
What do you think?

18:44.707 --> 18:47.168
Cody, I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.128
Lily hates pranks.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.464
And you don't understand her
at all, but I do.

18:51.548 --> 18:55.218
Because I actually listen to her
instead of giving her pink eye

18:55.301 --> 18:57.178
because you farted
on her pillow one time.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.805
And guess what, Cody?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.932
I'm gonna ask her out.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.188
Solid prank.
I admire your commitment.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.982
You've come a long way,
little fawn.

19:09.065 --> 19:13.444
Oh, it appears the student
a-has become a-the sensei.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.405
I'm serious, Cody.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.614
You have
a major prank addiction,

19:16.698 --> 19:18.074
and you need
serious medical help.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.034
And the saddest part is,
at the end of the day,

19:20.118 --> 19:22.829
the only person you're pranking
is yourself.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.212
What do you think you're...

19:32.755 --> 19:35.258
All right, take me
to the memories of Latrine.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.010
- The ones we saw earlier.
- One second.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.512
It's Octavia Spencer. Octavia!

19:39.596 --> 19:40.763
Take me!

19:40.847 --> 19:43.975
Why do you want me
to relive those horrors?

19:44.058 --> 19:46.394
Because I got a feeling
that all the partying you did

19:46.477 --> 19:50.231
in this sick-as-fuck brain hotel
is clouding your memory.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.405
This better be good. I'm late
for a cotton candy sugar scrub.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.449
Just go back ten seconds
and watch.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.328
What do you think?
Latrine or Garbache?

20:03.411 --> 20:05.496
Personally, I love Garbache.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.374
Brian! That's a terrible choice.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.003
Apologies, my liege.
We shall call it Latrine.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.338
Latrine!

20:13.421 --> 20:16.799
Yes, it must be Latrine.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.509
Mm-hmm.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.637
Next one.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.015
The most primo location
there is, sire.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.851
Melrose Avenue.
Between a Doc Martens

20:26.935 --> 20:29.145
- and a Johnny Rockets.
- Honestly, Brian,

20:29.228 --> 20:31.314
do you think your parents
are proud of you?

20:31.397 --> 20:32.732
Absolutely not, my liege.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.108
Huh? Oh!

20:34.192 --> 20:35.860
There's also a spot on Fairfax,

20:35.944 --> 20:38.780
but the property's
been abandoned for years.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.448
Yes, Fairfax.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.701
This is where our empire
will lay rest.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.536
Keep going. Whoa!

20:48.289 --> 20:51.292
How about
this hilarious potato shirt?

20:51.376 --> 20:54.170
It says "spud buds."

20:54.253 --> 20:56.673
Do you have any idea
what I could save in overhead

20:56.756 --> 20:58.132
if I fired you?

20:58.216 --> 21:00.927
Okay. Uh... What about this one?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.178
Perfect, Brian.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.014
Now, release it!

21:05.098 --> 21:06.641
I fucking knew it.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.352
Brian isn't your muse.
He's your Dale.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.437
- Come again?
- Your South Star.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.190
Whatever Brian suggested,
you did the opposite.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.485
Latrine became Latrine
despite Brian's shit-ass ideas.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.821
You had the mojo all along.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.197
It was always you.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.033
Heavens to Betsy. You're right!

21:24.117 --> 21:26.411
But I'll give him credit
for one thing.

21:26.494 --> 21:30.331
Do you, like, want to,
you know, maybe announce it?

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
Make it special,

21:31.791 --> 21:33.835
like you're dropping a mixtape
or a vaccine.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.337
Well, we did buy this lair
for a reason.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.714
Hmm.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.299
Announce the drop!

21:41.718 --> 21:44.554
Yes.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.515
Tronté! Get the Subcopter ready.

21:47.598 --> 21:51.310
We have a drop to drop.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.329
Damn!

22:16.044 --> 22:18.129
- Was that...?
- Yep.

22:18.212 --> 22:21.466
- Yo!
- He's back, motherfuckers!

22:31.350 --> 22:35.438
Hey. I'm Cody,
and I-I have a pranking problem.

22:52.622 --> 22:56.000
Mmm. Mmm. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.587
Ugh.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.047
What do you want?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.595
What the...?

23:07.678 --> 23:11.516
- That motherfucker!

23:58.646 --> 24:00.606
Chirp.
