00:48.134 --> 00:51.054
-Hand me the flashlight.
- Here it is.

00:53.139 --> 00:57.060
- Kit, I've got the shovel.
- You do?

00:57.143 --> 01:00.313
Lucy, get the box.

01:00.396 --> 01:02.899
- What are you putting in?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

01:07.695 --> 01:11.366
- My dad thinks I'm at your house.
- My mom thinks I'm at yours.

01:13.618 --> 01:15.244
Let's d i g deep.

01:16.579 --> 01:19.207
So no one will find it.

01:20.583 --> 01:25.338
- Di g it deeper!.
- We don't wanna get caught.

01:25.421 --> 01:27.924
I want some dirt.

01:30.635 --> 01:35.515
When we were ten growing up
in Georgia, Mimi, Kit and I...

01:35.598 --> 01:39.686
knew exactly what we wanted
out oflife.

01:39.769 --> 01:42.438
- Lucy, get the box.
- This is fun.

01:42.522 --> 01:47.610
So we put our dreams in a box,
and we buried it.

01:47.694 --> 01:50.029
We have to keep it dry.

01:59.205 --> 02:02.625
We made a pact to dig it up
at midnight...

02:02.709 --> 02:05.878
the day of our
high school graduation.

02:05.962 --> 02:08.297
Pack it down.

02:10.717 --> 02:14.554
- Let's be best friends forever.
- We will.

02:14.637 --> 02:17.765
Now, I don't even remember
what our wishes were--

02:17.890 --> 02:19.851
except for one.

02:19.976 --> 02:23.813
We wished that we'd be
best friends forever.

02:23.896 --> 02:27.984
Well, that wish
didn 't come true.

02:46.252 --> 02:50.340
I see you on the street
andyou walk on by

02:52.842 --> 02:54.761
Baby

02:54.844 --> 02:59.766
You make me wanna hang
my head down and cry

03:03.519 --> 03:07.440
Ifyou gave me
halfthe chance, you'd see

03:07.523 --> 03:11.694
My desire burning inside ofme

03:11.778 --> 03:16.616
But you choose
to look the other way

03:19.202 --> 03:23.122
I've had to work
much harder than this

03:23.206 --> 03:27.460
For something I want
Don 't try to resist me

03:27.543 --> 03:31.381
Open your heart to me, baby

03:31.464 --> 03:35.551
I hold the lock
andyou hold the key--

03:35.635 --> 03:37.887
- Lucille Wagner!.
- Pop?.

03:37.970 --> 03:41.057
- Baby, we're gonna be late.
- I was just--

03:41.140 --> 03:43.059
- Did you practice your speech?.
- I almost have it.

03:43.142 --> 03:45.978
Lucy, how's it gonna look if the
valedictorian messes up her speech?.

03:46.062 --> 03:47.730
Okay.

03:47.814 --> 03:51.067
Don't wrinkle your robe.
Just ironed it forya.

03:53.486 --> 03:58.074
Okay, big day!. Come on!
See ya on deck! Let's go!

03:58.157 --> 04:01.160
Toads do look like frogs.

04:01.244 --> 04:04.163
It's just one's, you know,
in the water and one's not.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.916
It doesn't--
It could happen to anybody.

04:08.668 --> 04:10.670
Hey, Mimi!
I know you want me.

04:13.339 --> 04:15.591
Ho!

04:15.675 --> 04:17.844
I'm gonna look
drop-dead gorgeous.

04:18.011 --> 04:20.680
You should see my dress.

04:20.762 --> 04:24.934
- Hello! Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me, Kit.

04:25.018 --> 04:27.353
What, you're too perfect
to bump into anybody?.

04:27.437 --> 04:29.522
- What?.
- Perfect.

04:29.647 --> 04:33.276
Sweet, proper...

04:33.359 --> 04:35.445
nerdy and virginal.

04:35.611 --> 04:38.114
- I'm not--
- You're a virgin.

04:38.197 --> 04:40.533
I told y'all.

04:40.616 --> 04:44.954
Just get us in the picture, okay?.
Hold my purse.

04:45.038 --> 04:48.708
No, don't push the button.
Wait till I get over there. Honey!

04:48.791 --> 04:54.047
- Mama, what are you doing?.
- One second. Stand up straight.

04:54.130 --> 04:57.300
- I am. I will.
- Tuckyour tummy in.

04:57.342 --> 04:59.635
- Smile.
- Mom, I'm smiling!

04:59.802 --> 05:01.804
Bigger, darling.

05:01.971 --> 05:05.975
- Lucy, your speech was wonderful.
- Thankyou.

05:06.142 --> 05:08.728
I hope you're gonna continue
studying music in college.

05:08.811 --> 05:10.813
Actually, Lucy wants
to become a doctor.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.900
Voice classes would make
nice electives.

05:13.983 --> 05:17.070
No time. We're looking at a double
major in biology and chemistry...

05:17.153 --> 05:21.491
if she wants to get into
the best med school, huh?.

05:21.616 --> 05:24.452
Henry, I'll show you how
to start that truck for tonight.

05:24.577 --> 05:27.663
All right.
See you later.

05:27.747 --> 05:30.917
- Bye, Ms. J.
- Good luck, Henry.

05:32.502 --> 05:34.504
I'm all he's got, you know?.

05:34.671 --> 05:36.589
Congratulations, Lucy.

05:38.925 --> 05:41.761
Thank you. Thanks.

05:50.687 --> 05:54.941
Here it is.
Honey, what's wrong?.

05:55.024 --> 05:56.943
I'm fine.

05:58.695 --> 06:03.449
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.702
Course you did.

06:07.537 --> 06:09.872
Why didn't it feel
like anything?.

06:10.039 --> 06:13.543
What do you mean, you didn't
feel anything?. It felt great!

06:15.128 --> 06:18.047
Pop, I never went
to one football game.

06:18.131 --> 06:20.299
You don't like football.

06:20.383 --> 06:24.220
But you're supposed to go,
and it's supposed to be fun.

06:24.387 --> 06:28.057
And like all the parties
at Hemmings Field and stuff...

06:28.141 --> 06:30.893
I never went to any of'em.

06:30.977 --> 06:35.982
I never stayed out late.
I never just hung out.

06:36.065 --> 06:38.401
'Cause you had
a head on your shoulders.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.653
You stayed home, and you studied.

06:40.653 --> 06:44.574
There's just a lot of things
that I wanted to do that I didn't.

06:46.242 --> 06:49.579
And I was up there getting
my diploma, and I was like...

06:49.662 --> 06:51.664
"Is this it?'

06:51.748 --> 06:55.835
Come on now. Didn't we both
work hard for this?.

06:58.588 --> 07:00.256
You're right.

07:00.340 --> 07:04.177
I guess it's just the pressure
of graduation. You're right.

07:12.018 --> 07:14.687
Girls, hi!

07:18.608 --> 07:20.026
Lucy.

07:28.868 --> 07:30.953
Mimi, not now. Okay?.

07:31.037 --> 07:33.956
- Are you comin' or not?.
- Coming where?.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.958
It's graduation night!

07:36.042 --> 07:39.962
Oh, God, Hemmings Field.
I totally forgot.

07:40.046 --> 07:42.632
So, are you comin' or not?.

07:44.967 --> 07:48.554
I have plans.
I'm sorry.

07:48.721 --> 07:51.474
Come on. You okay?.

08:01.234 --> 08:03.653
Do you want something?.

08:03.736 --> 08:06.572
Yeah. Are you coming
at midnight or what?.

08:07.657 --> 08:09.075
Excuse me?.

08:09.158 --> 08:11.494
Kit, we made a pact, remember?.

08:11.577 --> 08:14.831
Oh, you're not serious!

08:16.416 --> 08:19.419
Well, look, you can
really go without me.

08:19.502 --> 08:23.339
I have better things to do
than dig up some old box.

08:27.343 --> 08:30.346
Standing here
looking at all the world

08:41.524 --> 08:44.193
The guitar guy is such a hottie.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.862
That's Ben Kimble.

08:45.945 --> 08:48.364
I heard he just got out of jail.
Killed a guy.

08:49.532 --> 08:51.743
I don't believe you.

08:51.868 --> 08:55.038
Yeah! Everybody's talking about it.

08:55.163 --> 08:56.873
Oh, too bad!

08:57.040 --> 08:59.792
Well, if anyone could have him,
it'd be you.

08:59.876 --> 09:03.379
But I'm off the market, remember?.

09:03.463 --> 09:06.466
Oh, please!
Dylan's at UCLA doing...

09:06.507 --> 09:08.551
God knows what
with God knows who.

09:08.718 --> 09:10.219
That's not true.

09:10.345 --> 09:11.721
Right.

09:11.804 --> 09:13.765
Whatever.

09:15.892 --> 09:18.895
- Are you ready?.
- Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.

09:24.984 --> 09:26.903
Okay, hold on.

09:29.322 --> 09:30.990
Henry, are you ready?.

09:35.411 --> 09:36.913
I'm ready.

10:02.647 --> 10:04.524
That's okay. Go on.

10:17.829 --> 10:19.122
Why are you stopping?.

10:20.873 --> 10:22.959
This isn't how I hoped it would be.

10:23.042 --> 10:26.295
That's weird, 'cause this is
exactly how I hoped it would be...

10:26.337 --> 10:28.881
or pretty accurate.

10:28.965 --> 10:33.886
- Maybe ifwe get into bed.
- That's a good idea.

10:37.890 --> 10:40.143
These are nice sheets.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.523
- Can I hear the list again?.
- Oh, Luce, come on.

10:45.565 --> 10:49.110
Please, please.
Just one more time.

10:52.405 --> 10:54.824
Thanks.

10:54.907 --> 10:56.909
All right.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.582
Reason number one.

11:02.665 --> 11:06.669
We've been lab partners for three
years so we really trust each other.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.839
- That's really important. Okay.
- Trust is very important.

11:09.964 --> 11:12.675
Reason number two:. We are both 1 8
and have never done it.

11:13.718 --> 11:15.178
Very important!

11:16.387 --> 11:17.930
Reason number three:.

11:18.097 --> 11:21.434
We both want to do it.

11:21.517 --> 11:23.436
Reason number four--

11:26.022 --> 11:28.524
Please, Lucy, come on. Please.

11:28.608 --> 11:32.528
I'm, I'm begging you.
Please, let's just do it.

11:32.612 --> 11:36.199
- Okay, yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?.

11:36.282 --> 11:38.368
Okay, so let's--

11:42.288 --> 11:44.874
- I'll go this way.
- Okay, I'm going this way.

11:44.957 --> 11:46.876
Let's do this.

11:52.298 --> 11:55.134
Please don't laugh.
You're killing this.

11:55.218 --> 11:58.805
- Your first time should be special.
- Yeah, this is special!

11:58.888 --> 12:01.808
Listen, do you want to spend
the rest ofyour life...

12:01.891 --> 12:04.310
knowing that you did it for the
first time with your lab partner?.

12:04.394 --> 12:07.313
Yes, yes, I do.
And I'll tell you why.

12:07.397 --> 12:10.566
Because you know what it's like
for a guy to go to college a virgin?.

12:10.650 --> 12:13.069
No, I'm telling you
they, they--

12:13.152 --> 12:16.406
They're ostracized!
They treat them like lepers!

12:16.489 --> 12:18.074
I'm sorry.

12:19.409 --> 12:23.997
- What's up, Mimi?. How's the fetus?.
- Drop dead.

12:24.163 --> 12:27.667
- Is it mine or what?.
- I can't believe we went out.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.004
- I'm trying to do the right thing.
- Yeah?. What's the right thing?.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.589
Ignoring me
for the past five months?.

12:33.756 --> 12:37.176
Letting your friends call me a ho?.
Spreading rumors?.

12:37.343 --> 12:40.013
I'm repeating what I heard,
that you let some guy...

12:40.096 --> 12:43.099
do you in his car
over Christmas break.

12:45.268 --> 12:46.769
Jerk.

12:52.108 --> 12:54.360
It's ten paces
on the other side.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.948
- What are you doing here?.
- Where's Lucy?.

12:59.115 --> 13:00.783
She's not comin'.

13:02.618 --> 13:06.706
- You have a flashlight?. Good.
- Gimme back my flashlight!

13:17.300 --> 13:20.970
Let's just get this
over with, okay?.

13:35.234 --> 13:39.405
God, I don't even remember
what we put in here.

13:39.489 --> 13:41.407
Me either.

13:41.491 --> 13:44.327
Here, hold this
for a second, Lucy.

13:56.756 --> 13:59.425
My Bridal Barbie!

13:59.425 --> 14:02.095
She was my wish.

14:02.261 --> 14:04.847
- You're gettin' your wish.
- I know.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.352
Lucy, I think this is yours.

14:09.435 --> 14:11.771
- My locket.
- What did you wish for?.

14:13.022 --> 14:16.693
I wanted to find my mom.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.486
Did you ever find her?.

14:18.528 --> 14:23.449
No, she lives in Arizona and my pop
doesn't think it's a good idea, so--

14:23.574 --> 14:26.786
What did you wish for?.

14:28.955 --> 14:32.542
- A key chain?.
- No, the world.

14:32.625 --> 14:35.878
That I was gonna get out
of this crappy town...

14:35.962 --> 14:38.214
go all the way to California...

14:38.297 --> 14:42.802
put my feet
in the Pacific Ocean.

14:42.927 --> 14:45.888
There's a wish that's not
coming true for a while.

14:45.972 --> 14:49.976
- A lot you know, Kit.
- What's that supposed to mean?.

14:55.481 --> 14:57.400
Slide Records recording contest?.

14:57.483 --> 15:01.487
- So?.
- So I'm going on Sunday.

15:01.654 --> 15:05.658
You're going to California
to audition for a record company?.

15:05.742 --> 15:08.745
- Yeah.
- You're pregnant.

15:08.828 --> 15:11.748
- So?. I'll wear something slimming.
- And what?.

15:11.831 --> 15:14.083
You thinkyou're gonna become
this big, fat, pregnant star?.

15:14.167 --> 15:18.004
- I have a pretty good voice.
- How are you gonna get there?.

15:18.087 --> 15:22.008
- I found a ride with this guy.
- What?. No, that is crazy.

15:22.091 --> 15:25.011
You can't go to Los Angeles
by yourselfwith some guy.

15:25.178 --> 15:29.849
So?. Then come with me. I'll sing
lead, and you can sing backups.

15:29.932 --> 15:32.852
- It's not something we should do.
- It's stupid is what it is.

15:32.935 --> 15:35.688
Okay, fine.
You know what?.

15:35.772 --> 15:38.274
You can just forget
all your past!

15:41.027 --> 15:42.945
Oh, wow.

15:44.864 --> 15:48.951
- Oh, my goodness. Look at us!
- Let me see.

15:49.118 --> 15:51.954
- I was so chubby.
- Singing.

15:54.874 --> 15:58.461
- I have to go meet my friends.
- Yeah, it's getting late.

16:00.296 --> 16:01.714
Yeah.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.886
Hey, you guys.

16:06.969 --> 16:11.307
I'm leaving Sunday at 7:00 a.m.
ifyou all wanna come.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.818
What do you mean you're not
coming home for the summer?.

16:21.984 --> 16:24.737
Dylan, listen to me,
you have to come home.

16:24.821 --> 16:28.658
Because! I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

16:28.741 --> 16:30.660
Don't you miss me?.

16:30.743 --> 16:34.664
- Excuse me.
- Dad, customer!

16:34.747 --> 16:37.000
Dylan, we have to plan
the wedding.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.835
All right.

16:38.918 --> 16:42.171
I love you--
Dylan?.

16:51.931 --> 16:54.767
- Hey, darlin'.
- Hey, Pop.

16:54.851 --> 16:58.354
Dr.Johnson called today.
Good news.

16:58.438 --> 17:00.606
Got me a job at the hospital?.

17:00.690 --> 17:03.026
All those discounts I gave him
finally paid off.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.361
- Cool.
- Yep.

17:05.528 --> 17:08.364
Can I askyou a question?.

17:08.448 --> 17:10.116
It's about Mother.

17:14.954 --> 17:18.540
- Has she ever tried to see me?.
- No, she hasn't.

17:18.708 --> 17:21.711
I was thinking,
maybe she's afraid to visit me.

17:21.794 --> 17:24.380
Luce, you do not have
to feel any guilt...

17:24.547 --> 17:27.215
about your mother leaving us.

17:27.383 --> 17:29.052
This is not about us.

17:29.218 --> 17:32.221
She was the one who walked out
on a three-year-old.

17:32.305 --> 17:35.808
She's the one that should
feel guilty. All right?.

17:35.892 --> 17:38.061
All right.

18:38.538 --> 18:40.623
Nobody brings four suitcases
on a road trip.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.960
Look, Dylan asked me
to go see him in LA...

18:44.043 --> 18:46.629
and I can't get there
looking like a skank.

18:46.713 --> 18:49.215
You better hope it all fits.

18:49.382 --> 18:51.300
It will, okay?.

18:55.054 --> 18:58.558
I'm not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.144
- Fine.
- Fine.

19:01.227 --> 19:05.314
- Fine. Shotgun.
- Yeah, right. I'm sitting up front.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.902
You must be Lucy.

19:10.028 --> 19:11.320
Yeah.

19:14.449 --> 19:16.409
So you're taking us to L.A.?.

19:16.534 --> 19:18.995
Yeah. I'll get your bag.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.083
- You okay?. Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:24.167 --> 19:28.338
- Move it, Ben! Let's go!
- I'll get the door foryou.

19:34.802 --> 19:36.679
Hey, who's the guy?.

19:36.763 --> 19:40.099
That's just Ben.
He's really cool.

19:41.934 --> 19:43.770
Let's hit it.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.806
Where's the bathroom?.

20:19.889 --> 20:22.558
Second door.
There's no soap.

20:33.986 --> 20:35.905
What's the deal with Lucy?.

20:35.988 --> 20:39.492
- What, are you hot for her?.
- No.

20:41.119 --> 20:44.998
I wouldn't even try, Ben.
Seriously, she's not like us.

20:45.081 --> 20:47.083
She's way out ofyour league.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.172
Want a chip?.

20:55.008 --> 20:56.926
Get outta here.

21:06.102 --> 21:07.854
What are you doin'?.

21:08.021 --> 21:10.690
- What's with this music?.
- Well, I like it.

21:10.773 --> 21:13.026
Can we listen to something else
for ten minutes?.

21:14.277 --> 21:15.778
No.

21:15.862 --> 21:17.780
Come on, Ben, please?.

21:17.864 --> 21:19.532
Be a nice guy.

21:19.574 --> 21:22.368
Okay, five minutes.
Just five minutes.

21:22.452 --> 21:23.870
Thankyou.

21:27.123 --> 21:30.001
I don't wanna be a fool

21:30.126 --> 21:33.046
In this game fortwo

21:33.129 --> 21:37.216
So I'm leavingyou behind

21:37.300 --> 21:40.970
Bye, bye, bye
Don't make it tough

21:41.095 --> 21:43.890
I've had enough

21:43.931 --> 21:47.060
Bye, bye

21:47.143 --> 21:49.687
Baby

21:52.148 --> 21:55.568
- Ben!
- I can't listen to this.

21:55.735 --> 21:57.904
- You said five minutes.
- Forget it.

21:58.029 --> 22:00.656
Like this is any better.

22:14.754 --> 22:18.216
- Why are we stopped?.
- I'm tired.

22:18.341 --> 22:19.926
Let someone else drive.

22:20.009 --> 22:22.679
No, nobody drives
the cruiser but me.

22:22.804 --> 22:25.932
- Okay, whatever.
- Where are we gonna sleep?.

22:26.057 --> 22:28.685
There's a field.
I got a tent and sleeping bags.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.771
A field?.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.484
No, I don't sleep in a field.

22:36.609 --> 22:39.028
I saw a sign for a Hilton
back there.

22:39.112 --> 22:41.698
How much money do we have?.

22:45.618 --> 22:48.871
I can't believe
you only brought $40.

22:48.955 --> 22:53.793
I have expenses. I had to have
my homecoming dress custom-made.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.129
I was voted queen, you know.

22:56.212 --> 22:58.798
Oh, my dream come true.

22:58.965 --> 23:02.635
- Did anybody make a plan?.
- What do you mean?.

23:02.802 --> 23:05.888
How far you'll drive each day?.
Which towns you'll stop in?.

23:05.972 --> 23:08.641
How much gas money you'll need?.

23:09.726 --> 23:11.644
Okay.

23:11.728 --> 23:16.315
We have $486, right?.
Which means...

23:16.399 --> 23:19.652
for food, gas--

23:21.487 --> 23:22.905
Is it enough?.

23:22.989 --> 23:25.658
It's gonna be tight.

23:29.829 --> 23:31.998
Oh, my gosh.

23:32.081 --> 23:35.168
It's a love room.

23:36.753 --> 23:38.171
Oh, man!

23:38.254 --> 23:39.839
Look at the walls!

23:39.839 --> 23:42.592
- I'm not sleeping here!
- This is what we can afford.

23:42.675 --> 23:45.178
Is this run by the hour?.
I'm not sleeping here.

23:45.345 --> 23:47.597
- Where you gonna sleep?.
- I don't know.

23:47.680 --> 23:51.267
This place is disgusting.
I'll take this bed.

24:01.444 --> 24:03.613
So how come
you're going to L.A.?.

24:07.367 --> 24:09.619
My uncle might have
a job for me there...

24:09.702 --> 24:14.290
so I'm gonna check it out
and if I like it, I'll move there.

24:14.374 --> 24:17.794
What about your band?.
Don't you have a band?.

24:17.877 --> 24:21.297
No, I was just filling in the
other night. I don't have a band.

24:24.133 --> 24:27.303
Mimi said that she didn't think
you'd come with us on the trip.

24:29.222 --> 24:31.140
Neither did I.

24:31.224 --> 24:33.810
You sorry you did?.

24:33.893 --> 24:36.145
Not so far.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.238
Well, good night.

24:45.321 --> 24:47.240
Good night.

25:06.092 --> 25:10.179
Hey! It's freakin' cold!

25:10.263 --> 25:13.266
- We're in here.
- I'm in here.

25:13.349 --> 25:15.852
I just need
to brush my teeth.

25:23.943 --> 25:26.446
- What are you doing?.
- You're so touchy.

25:28.364 --> 25:31.701
Mimi, how do you know Ben?.

25:31.784 --> 25:36.039
- Just from around.
- Gosh, don't you think he's cute?.

25:36.205 --> 25:40.209
- He's all right.
- I can't believe he was in jail.

25:40.293 --> 25:43.212
- What?.
- Yeah!

25:43.296 --> 25:46.883
He like killed a guy.
What?. That's what I heard.

25:47.050 --> 25:49.469
Excuse me?.
He killed somebody?.

25:49.552 --> 25:54.724
No, he did not kill anybody--
I don't think.

25:54.807 --> 25:58.561
Okay, he had a car, he was
coming to L.A. Don't be upset.

25:58.644 --> 26:02.648
I'm on a road trip with a killer and
you're telling me not to be upset?.

26:02.732 --> 26:05.902
- He'll hearyou.
- Oh, my God.

26:12.575 --> 26:13.743
What's up?.

26:19.165 --> 26:21.250
Do you know him at all?.

26:21.334 --> 26:24.921
He used to hang out with some
of the guys at the trailer park.

26:27.006 --> 26:29.175
So he may have
killed someone, okay?.

26:29.258 --> 26:33.763
So what?. He did his time.
He paid his debt to society.

26:33.930 --> 26:36.432
Oh, my God.

26:43.606 --> 26:44.774
Ready to go?.

26:44.941 --> 26:46.776
Yeah.

26:46.859 --> 26:50.780
Hey, you wanna ride up front
with me today?.

26:50.863 --> 26:55.034
No, that's okay.
The backseat's fine. It's okay.

26:55.118 --> 26:58.371
- I'll check us out, okay?.
- Yeah.

27:12.468 --> 27:14.303
- I'll be back.
- I'll come with ya.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.556
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

27:16.639 --> 27:20.309
- Will you please get me some chips?.
- No, Mimi.

27:20.393 --> 27:21.978
Open the door.

27:24.981 --> 27:27.650
I'll get my own chips.

27:31.654 --> 27:33.906
Y'all, wait for me!

27:40.079 --> 27:44.167
So when he came home
last Christmas, he proposed.

27:44.250 --> 27:47.420
He's comin' home as soon as
he's done with school next spring.

27:47.503 --> 27:50.340
You're seriously
gonna marry that loser?.

27:50.423 --> 27:52.342
You don't even know him.

27:56.012 --> 27:58.848
- What's wrong?.
- Nothing. It just kicked, is all.

27:58.931 --> 28:01.017
- Can I feel it?.
- Ifyou want.

28:01.768 --> 28:03.353
It kicked again.

28:03.519 --> 28:07.190
- What about Kurt?.
- What about Kurt?.

28:07.357 --> 28:10.860
- He's the father, isn't he?.
- Yes, Kurt's the father.

28:10.943 --> 28:14.614
But it wasn't working out,
so I dumped him.

28:14.697 --> 28:17.533
You're gonna raise this baby
all by yourself?.

28:17.700 --> 28:21.454
I'm gonna go wait in the car
with Ben, all right?.

28:21.537 --> 28:23.623
That's so typical of her.

28:23.706 --> 28:27.710
She's not thinkin' about her future.
How's she gonna get by with a baby?.

28:27.794 --> 28:30.380
Well, she brought this
upon herself.

28:31.714 --> 28:33.216
What?.

28:43.810 --> 28:48.398
- Hello.
- Hi, Pop.

28:48.481 --> 28:51.067
Sneaking away in
the middle of the night?.

28:51.150 --> 28:53.486
I'm very upset with you.
Dr.Johnson went...

28:53.569 --> 28:55.905
to a great deal of trouble
to get you that job.

28:55.989 --> 28:59.575
- I'm sorry, okay?.
- Sorry?

28:59.742 --> 29:03.162
You are coming back now! And
you will regard that as a command!

29:03.246 --> 29:05.415
You're usually so levelheaded...

29:05.498 --> 29:08.751
andyou pull a stunt like this,
I am so surprised atyou.

29:08.751 --> 29:11.671
You worked so hard. Areyou
gonna start slacking offnow?

29:29.439 --> 29:31.607
What are you writing there?.

29:31.691 --> 29:33.359
Stuff.

29:38.281 --> 29:40.700
Are you mad at me or something?.

29:40.783 --> 29:43.369
Why would I be mad at you?.
I don't even know you.

29:46.205 --> 29:50.626
- No!
- Oh, no, it sounds bad.

29:50.710 --> 29:53.546
Look at all that smoke.

30:06.476 --> 30:08.728
What's wrong with it, Ben?.

30:08.811 --> 30:11.981
It's the head gasket, I think.

30:12.065 --> 30:14.817
- Give me your shirt.
- Here.

30:16.819 --> 30:18.905
Whoa! What are you doing?.

30:19.072 --> 30:21.324
Nobody touches this except
for specialists and myself.

30:21.491 --> 30:24.327
Because it's an antique
and I don't want people to--

30:25.912 --> 30:28.665
- It's your radiator.
- No, it's the head gasket.

30:28.748 --> 30:34.420
No, your radiator's cracked.
What year it this?. '73.

30:34.504 --> 30:38.257
Oh, that's like 350,
plus labor.

30:40.176 --> 30:42.178
Great! Great!

30:52.522 --> 30:53.940
I'm hungry.

30:54.023 --> 30:57.110
How long does it take
to get a tow truck?.

30:57.193 --> 31:01.197
- Ben's only been gone two hours.
- I'm so hungry.

31:01.280 --> 31:05.034
Won't you stop saying that?.
We heard you. You're hungry.

31:05.118 --> 31:07.620
So what?.

31:11.874 --> 31:15.712
We don't have $350.
Even if he gets a tow truck...

31:15.795 --> 31:17.964
we don't have enough money
to get the car fixed.

31:18.047 --> 31:22.969
I'm gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I?. Where am I?.

31:23.052 --> 31:24.387
Louisiana.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.974
Stuck in some
butt-hole town, Louisiana.

31:28.057 --> 31:30.143
I am never gonna get to LA
to see Dylan.

31:30.226 --> 31:32.395
He's gonna be so upset.

31:33.312 --> 31:35.148
Whatever.

31:35.231 --> 31:36.983
Excuse me?.

31:37.066 --> 31:39.152
Could you be more self-centered?.

31:42.155 --> 31:45.491
- You're just jealous.
- What?.

31:45.575 --> 31:49.996
I'm not blind. I know how girls
like you looked at me in school.

31:50.079 --> 31:52.665
You would've given anything
to trade places with me.

31:52.749 --> 31:54.667
Girls like me?.

31:54.751 --> 31:58.004
I can't help it if I'm popular,
so just lay off.

32:00.423 --> 32:02.258
Girls like me?.

32:02.342 --> 32:05.678
I didn't make the rules, Mimi.
It's not my fault...

32:05.762 --> 32:07.930
everyone thinks
you're a trailer-trash skeeze.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.684
- Stop it!
- Don't touch me like that!

32:11.768 --> 32:14.270
- Guys, don't!
- You're pregnant!

32:14.354 --> 32:16.522
You're a redneck!

32:16.689 --> 32:20.860
Girls! Mimi! Stop!

32:21.027 --> 32:27.200
Stop it! Stop!
I'm so sick of the two ofyou...

32:27.283 --> 32:29.452
bitching and fighting
every damn second of the day!

32:29.535 --> 32:32.455
For once,
would you just shut up?.

32:32.538 --> 32:36.042
I don't know why the hell I asked
the two ofyou to come on this trip.

32:36.209 --> 32:38.378
We don't belong together.

32:38.461 --> 32:41.047
This was a mistake, okay?.

32:43.549 --> 32:46.803
I'm sorry, partner,
that's the best I can do.

32:50.556 --> 32:52.392
It's a cracked radiator.

32:55.061 --> 32:57.897
He said he'd get it ready
by tomorrow.

32:57.980 --> 32:59.982
How will we get the money
to pay for it?.

33:02.485 --> 33:04.404
I have an idea.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.572
I'm gonna call my father
and have him come get me.

33:06.739 --> 33:08.658
You're leaving?.

33:08.741 --> 33:10.910
This trip's over.

33:11.077 --> 33:13.746
Wait, I have an idea!

33:13.913 --> 33:16.916
You know what?.
I'm sick ofyour ideas, Mimi.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.876
I should've known you'd make
a mess of this trip.

33:19.085 --> 33:24.257
Fine, run home to your daddy,
but don't try and blame this on me.

33:33.099 --> 33:38.271
Lucy, I haven't asked you
for anything in a really long time.

33:38.354 --> 33:41.441
But I'm gonna askyou to stay.

33:41.607 --> 33:45.611
Please hang up the damn phone
and just stay with us!

33:45.778 --> 33:47.613
Come on, Lucy.

33:49.198 --> 33:50.950
Hello?

33:53.870 --> 33:57.123
I do.
I have a really good idea.

33:57.206 --> 34:00.293
Yeah, it better be good.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.146
Okay, I have something
to say.

34:20.228 --> 34:24.984
I know we're not all getting along,
but tonight's important.

34:25.068 --> 34:27.402
We really need the money.

34:27.487 --> 34:31.908
So could we just be civil
and get through this?. Okay?.

34:31.991 --> 34:33.576
Okay.

34:37.163 --> 34:40.750
All right!
Y'all ready?.

34:40.833 --> 34:42.752
Yeah.

34:45.588 --> 34:47.924
- That's cute.
- Thankyou.

34:53.763 --> 34:55.264
Wait.

34:56.766 --> 34:58.685
It's all the tips
we can get, right?.

34:58.768 --> 35:00.436
- Mm-hmm.
- So?.

35:00.603 --> 35:02.522
Ifwe wanna put on a show,
we have to be sexy.

35:02.605 --> 35:05.525
Now you're talkin'.

35:08.444 --> 35:12.115
- Whatcha got?.
- Let me wear those feathers.

35:12.198 --> 35:15.034
All right, next contestant's
a brand-new act.

35:15.118 --> 35:18.287
And for all tourists that don't
know how the rules go in my club...

35:18.371 --> 35:20.456
here it is, plain and simple.

35:20.623 --> 35:22.625
You're the judge.
Ifyou hate 'em, tell 'em.

35:22.709 --> 35:24.711
Ifyou like 'em, pay 'em.

35:24.794 --> 35:27.130
We got baskets going around.
Put the money in there.

35:27.255 --> 35:30.299
Be loud, be fair and be generous
ifyou like what you hear.

35:30.383 --> 35:32.635
So, come on, give 'em
a warm welcome.

35:59.829 --> 36:02.040
- They lookyoung.
- It's past their bedtime.

36:09.422 --> 36:13.509
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

36:13.593 --> 36:17.180
Get off the stage!

36:20.808 --> 36:23.019
- Mimi, come on!
- I can't do it.

36:24.979 --> 36:28.900
- You can do it.
- I thought so, but I can't.

36:28.941 --> 36:31.944
- Please do it for me.
- You just gotta go do it.

36:32.111 --> 36:35.406
- No, you do it.
- I don't know if I can.

36:35.406 --> 36:39.202
You've got the best voice.
Come on, please for me.

36:39.327 --> 36:42.038
- Okay, okay.
- Thankyou.

36:42.121 --> 36:44.248
- You okay?.
- No.

37:05.478 --> 37:09.023
I saw him dancing there
by the record machine

37:10.900 --> 37:14.237
I knew he must have been
about 17

37:16.322 --> 37:18.658
The beat was going strong

37:18.741 --> 37:22.245
Playing my favorite song

37:22.412 --> 37:28.251
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me, yeah, me

37:28.418 --> 37:33.756
I could tell it wouldn 't be long
till he was with me singing

37:33.798 --> 37:38.845
I love rock and roll so put
another dime in the jukebox, baby

37:38.928 --> 37:45.018
I love rock and roll so come
and take some time and dance with me

37:49.105 --> 37:52.567
He smiled so I got up
and asked for his name

37:54.193 --> 37:58.614
But that don 't matter
he said 'cause it's all the same

37:58.698 --> 38:01.409
He said, can I take you home

38:01.451 --> 38:06.205
Where we can be alone

38:06.289 --> 38:09.083
And next we were movin ' on
and he was with me

38:09.250 --> 38:11.210
Yeah, me

38:11.336 --> 38:16.632
And next we were movin ' on and
he was with me, yeah, me, singing

38:32.690 --> 38:34.776
I love rock and roll

38:34.901 --> 38:38.154
'Cause it soothes my soul
Yeah

38:38.237 --> 38:40.156
I love rock and roll

38:40.281 --> 38:42.659
Yeah

38:54.253 --> 38:58.007
And we were moving on
and singing that same old song

38:58.174 --> 39:00.009
Yeah, me

39:22.115 --> 39:26.661
Roll, roll, roll

39:50.059 --> 39:52.729
Now.

39:53.646 --> 39:55.565
It's so amazing.

40:09.078 --> 40:11.664
Lucy, come here.

40:14.250 --> 40:17.337
- How much is it?.
- Enough for the car and the trip.

40:17.462 --> 40:19.922
Perfect.

40:24.093 --> 40:26.012
You wanna come dance with us?.

40:26.095 --> 40:30.016
No. We should get outta here before
somebody realizes you're underage.

40:30.099 --> 40:32.602
Come on, just a
little bit longer, please?.

40:32.685 --> 40:35.855
- All right, you go ahead.
- Thankyou.

40:40.443 --> 40:44.530
- Hey, she with you?.
- What?.

40:44.697 --> 40:47.700
Is she your girl?.

40:47.742 --> 40:49.702
No.

40:49.786 --> 40:52.872
Yeah. Watch this.

41:05.885 --> 41:07.553
Move your hands, please.

41:09.806 --> 41:13.267
We're gonna get a little freaky.
Hey, what's up, baby?. Come on.

41:13.393 --> 41:15.895
- What's wrong?.
- Will you stop it?.

41:15.978 --> 41:19.273
Excuse me. Hey, I don't think
she wants to dance.

41:19.399 --> 41:22.402
I think she does.
You should mind your own business.

41:22.485 --> 41:25.279
- Will you leave me alone?.
- Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

41:28.324 --> 41:29.575
My nose!

41:33.830 --> 41:35.081
Let's go.

41:40.837 --> 41:42.755
Oh, damn!

41:42.839 --> 41:44.298
Is this livin' or what?.

41:44.424 --> 41:46.926
There's a mini-bar!

41:48.219 --> 41:52.640
Y'all, you could swim
in this bathtub!

41:54.017 --> 41:55.601
Look, I'm--

41:57.186 --> 41:59.605
I'm not mad at you
for what happened there. Okay?.

41:59.689 --> 42:01.524
There's bathrobes!

42:02.692 --> 42:04.652
- Where are you going?.
-Just going out.

42:06.612 --> 42:10.033
Are any ofyou guys tired,
'cause it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm wired!

42:10.199 --> 42:14.871
- Who wants some of mama's punch?.
- Me, please.

42:14.954 --> 42:17.874
- Madame.
- Madame.

42:37.727 --> 42:40.396
Go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!

42:45.234 --> 42:48.237
What are you doing?.

42:49.405 --> 42:51.491
You go, girl!

42:58.748 --> 43:00.833
I have seen one, y'all.

43:00.958 --> 43:04.671
Yeah, but have you touched one?.

43:06.422 --> 43:10.051
She has!
Give us the details!

43:10.176 --> 43:13.721
It's always the quiet ones.

43:13.846 --> 43:16.432
Say it loud. Say you
touched one and you're proud!

43:16.599 --> 43:19.352
Lucy touched one!
She did!

43:29.278 --> 43:32.365
Okay, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

43:32.490 --> 43:34.575
- That's easy.
- What?.

43:35.952 --> 43:38.746
Reaching my goal weight.

43:38.871 --> 43:42.375
Third year at fat camp,
the summer before eighth grade.

43:42.542 --> 43:45.878
Wait, that camp you went to
every summer was a fat camp?.

43:49.674 --> 43:52.135
Yes, and I loved it.

43:52.301 --> 43:54.470
For two months...

43:54.554 --> 43:58.474
my mama wasn't around
to pick on me for being fat.

43:59.851 --> 44:03.062
Being fat is just
unacceptable to her.

44:04.981 --> 44:08.901
Okay. The worst thing
that ever happened to you.

44:08.985 --> 44:11.571
That's even easier.
Reaching my goal weight.

44:11.654 --> 44:13.406
- You said--
- It turns out...

44:13.489 --> 44:16.993
that being prettier
than my mama...

44:17.160 --> 44:19.662
is even more
unacceptable.

44:20.913 --> 44:22.498
Oh,Jesus.

44:24.083 --> 44:26.002
Yep.

44:26.085 --> 44:30.173
One morning I woke up,
and she was gone.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.259
Pop really wouldn't
say anything about it.

44:33.343 --> 44:37.347
I thought she was coming back,
and Pop told me she wasn't.

44:38.348 --> 44:41.059
They fought all the time.

44:41.184 --> 44:44.520
You know, I think
that she just got fed up...

44:44.604 --> 44:47.315
and took off
without even thinking.

44:47.440 --> 44:51.361
And after a while, it was
just too late to come back.

44:53.196 --> 44:55.782
I know she wants to see me.

44:58.201 --> 45:00.620
She's just scared, that's all.

45:02.497 --> 45:05.875
I'm gonna be so sick later.

45:06.042 --> 45:09.212
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant
and you couldn't act stupid with us.

45:09.379 --> 45:13.966
That's not why I don't drink.
I just don't see the point in it.

45:14.050 --> 45:15.802
So you never partied?.

45:18.388 --> 45:20.306
Once.

45:22.475 --> 45:24.060
Over Christmas.

45:25.353 --> 45:28.815
There was one of those parties
at Hemmings Field.

45:30.733 --> 45:33.152
And this guy
was drinking this beer...

45:33.236 --> 45:38.074
and I remember
it was in a blue bottle.

45:38.157 --> 45:42.078
And I was real mad
at Kurt because...

45:42.286 --> 45:45.832
he blew me off again
to hang out with his friends.

45:47.500 --> 45:50.169
So I had a few beers.

45:52.005 --> 45:54.257
I had more than a few.

45:56.175 --> 46:00.179
This guy, you know, he seemed--
He seemed real nice...

46:00.346 --> 46:03.349
'cause when I couldn't walk,
he offered to drive me home.

46:08.271 --> 46:11.357
It's no big deal, Luce.
It happens to girls all the time.

46:11.524 --> 46:13.943
Did you go to the police?.

46:14.110 --> 46:16.195
No.

46:16.362 --> 46:19.782
I'm from a trailer park.
I got drunk and got in his car.

46:19.949 --> 46:22.952
So, Kurt's not the father?.

46:24.203 --> 46:26.873
I saw this ad in a magazine.

46:27.040 --> 46:32.712
So I called up this lawyer in
Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.

46:32.795 --> 46:35.131
Um, all these pictures
and letters...

46:35.298 --> 46:38.301
of all these people
who want babies.

46:38.468 --> 46:40.887
- I was supposed to pick one.
- The guy...

46:43.306 --> 46:45.475
what was his name?.

46:47.643 --> 46:49.645
I don't know.

46:52.231 --> 46:55.735
Why did we stop being friends?.

46:55.818 --> 46:58.655
I don't know.
People drift apart.

46:58.738 --> 47:02.492
Promise me we won't
drift apart again.

47:04.410 --> 47:06.079
Come here.

47:07.747 --> 47:10.667
And where have you been
all night?.

47:18.174 --> 47:20.176
Thankyou.

47:20.259 --> 47:22.679
For what you did
last night, I mean.

47:22.762 --> 47:24.931
Thanks.

47:28.434 --> 47:30.353
Scoot over.

47:39.612 --> 47:41.614
I'm never drinkin' again. Honest.

47:41.781 --> 47:43.783
This burrito is so good.

47:43.866 --> 47:46.035
Don't mention food.

47:47.870 --> 47:51.040
- What are you doing?.
- Chilling.

48:03.219 --> 48:05.471
- Wake him up.
- Y'all, he's been driving all day.

48:05.555 --> 48:09.642
- We can't just stay here.
- We should just let him sleep.

48:09.726 --> 48:12.061
- Uh-uh.
- We'll let him sleep.

48:12.228 --> 48:15.648
Lucy, get his keys.

48:15.648 --> 48:18.651
He told us we couldn't drive
his car. I can't do that.

48:18.735 --> 48:21.321
Why not?. It's not like we're
gonna drive this over a cliff.

48:21.404 --> 48:25.074
- It's stupid to stay here.
- I'll drive.

48:25.158 --> 48:26.743
Get his keys.

48:26.826 --> 48:29.746
- Yeah, get his keys.
- Why do I have to get his keys?.

48:29.829 --> 48:34.417
Because Kit and I voted
and you lost.

48:34.500 --> 48:35.918
Get the keys.

48:36.002 --> 48:38.671
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.

48:46.179 --> 48:50.683
- This is stealing.
- It's not stealing if he's in the car.

48:50.767 --> 48:53.186
No, it's kidnapping.

49:00.610 --> 49:02.445
Okay, stop.

49:05.782 --> 49:08.368
Oh, I got it.

49:17.710 --> 49:19.295
Go, go.

49:31.057 --> 49:33.726
You failed driver's ed,
didn't you?.

49:33.893 --> 49:35.978
Maybe.

49:36.062 --> 49:39.732
- Move over.
- Oh, God.

49:40.900 --> 49:42.986
Guys, smile for the camera.

49:57.083 --> 49:59.502
Go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.

50:06.843 --> 50:09.178
Let's go, girls

50:15.852 --> 50:19.522
I'm goin'out tonight
and I'm feeling all right

50:19.605 --> 50:23.526
I'm gonna let
it all hang out

50:23.609 --> 50:25.862
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice

50:27.447 --> 50:31.284
Yeah, I'm gonna scream and shout

50:39.208 --> 50:42.712
Get a little outta line

50:42.795 --> 50:46.299
I ain 't gonna act
politically correct

50:46.382 --> 50:50.636
I only wanna have a good time

50:50.720 --> 50:54.807
The best thing about being a woman

50:54.891 --> 50:59.062
Is the prerogative
to have a little fun and

50:59.145 --> 51:03.650
Oh, oh, oh
Go totally crazy

51:04.817 --> 51:07.904
- Hi! Did you have a good nap?.
- Yeah.

51:07.987 --> 51:10.073
Stop, stop the car.

51:10.156 --> 51:13.076
Don't be mad. You looked so sweet
when you were sleeping.

51:13.159 --> 51:16.579
- We just didn't wanna wake you.
- Stop the car.

51:16.663 --> 51:19.165
- It's against the law to park here.
- It's my car.

51:19.332 --> 51:21.918
- We're almost at an exit.
- Stop the damn car!

51:44.023 --> 51:46.943
- Mimi, go talk to him.
- Uh-uh, you go talk to him.

51:47.110 --> 51:49.862
- Nobody's gonna go talk to him.
- I know, he's mad.

51:51.197 --> 51:53.533
And he has killed before.

51:53.700 --> 51:57.036
Mimi, you said
he didn't kill anyone.

51:57.203 --> 52:01.374
- I said I thought he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

52:05.795 --> 52:08.715
- It's okay, I'll go.
- I'm sorry.

52:12.552 --> 52:14.470
God!

52:14.554 --> 52:17.390
Be careful, Lucy.

52:23.229 --> 52:26.816
- We're sorry.
- I've been in a car full of chicks.

52:26.983 --> 52:30.153
Do you have any idea what it's like
being surrounded by girls?.

52:32.739 --> 52:35.825
Being a girl yourself,
I know, stupid question.

52:35.908 --> 52:39.579
But I'm a guy, okay?.
I'm a guy.Just a guy.

52:39.662 --> 52:44.000
And I have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do...

52:44.083 --> 52:46.502
your girl things for days.

52:46.586 --> 52:49.422
I'm not complaining, 'cause,
let's face it, I'm outnumbered.

52:49.505 --> 52:51.424
But that's my car.

52:51.507 --> 52:54.427
It's my car, and it's just--

52:58.931 --> 53:01.267
It's the one thing that hasn't
been taken over by chicks.

53:03.019 --> 53:06.689
- Okay?.
- Okay.

53:37.637 --> 53:40.890
- Ben?.
- Yeah?.

53:40.973 --> 53:43.142
Were you really in jail?.

53:45.561 --> 53:47.480
Yeah, I was.

53:47.563 --> 53:49.816
- So you killed a guy?.
- What?.

53:51.067 --> 53:53.152
Who said I killed a guy?.

53:54.320 --> 53:57.407
Everybody back home.

53:57.573 --> 54:02.245
Oh, man.
No, I didn't kill a guy.

54:02.328 --> 54:04.914
What did you do then?.

54:05.081 --> 54:10.586
I was in college, and I get
this call from my stepsister.

54:10.670 --> 54:15.508
She wants me to come get her 'cause
my stepdad is beating her up.

54:15.591 --> 54:17.677
My mom can't stop him, so...

54:17.760 --> 54:21.431
I drive home in
the middle of the night...

54:21.514 --> 54:25.018
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out...

54:25.101 --> 54:27.020
and then I drive her back
to school in Ohio with me.

54:27.103 --> 54:30.606
- And you went to jail for that?.
- That's the thing.

54:30.690 --> 54:32.525
There's this law...

54:32.608 --> 54:36.195
against driving a child that's
not a relative across state lines...

54:36.279 --> 54:38.948
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges.

54:39.032 --> 54:41.868
But, you know, it's okay.
I only got six months...

54:41.951 --> 54:44.203
and I had to stay in Ohio
for a year's probation.

54:44.287 --> 54:47.790
My sister got to go live
with her mom.

54:53.713 --> 54:56.132
You all really thought
I killed a guy?.

54:57.300 --> 54:59.218
Yeah.

55:01.471 --> 55:05.391
What were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac?.

55:22.492 --> 55:25.912
- Why are we stopping?.
- You'll see.

55:37.590 --> 55:40.760
- Mimi, you okay?.
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

55:45.181 --> 55:47.183
Look.

55:51.688 --> 55:54.023
It's like you have to whisper.

55:55.775 --> 55:57.694
Hello!

56:07.203 --> 56:10.707
Man. We gotta make time. The next
hotel is still an hour away.

56:10.790 --> 56:14.544
Ben, do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us?.

56:15.294 --> 56:16.713
You serious?.

56:16.796 --> 56:19.382
You really want to camp here?.

56:19.549 --> 56:20.800
Yeah.

56:22.885 --> 56:25.054
It sounds like fun.

56:27.557 --> 56:31.060
You gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this.

56:32.562 --> 56:34.814
Right. Now, the trick is...

56:34.897 --> 56:38.401
you don't want to let him know
that you're gonna hit him.

56:38.484 --> 56:42.071
Maybe like look away first.

56:42.155 --> 56:46.409
And then, when he least expects it,
you throw your whole body into it.

56:51.164 --> 56:53.082
What are you doing to her?.

56:53.166 --> 56:55.084
I'm teaching her how to fight
because every girl...

56:55.168 --> 56:58.004
should know how
to throw a decent punch.

56:58.087 --> 56:59.505
That was decent.

56:59.589 --> 57:01.591
I'm gonna go to bed.

57:01.674 --> 57:04.510
I'm gonna go to the ladies room.
Where is it again?.

57:04.594 --> 57:07.513
Third bush after the rock
over there.

57:07.597 --> 57:09.932
- This one?.
- That one, yeah.

57:15.021 --> 57:17.023
What are you always
writing in there?.

57:18.524 --> 57:21.361
Poems, mostly.

57:21.444 --> 57:23.946
Can I hear one?.

57:25.365 --> 57:29.118
Okay. One.
But you can't laugh.

57:34.457 --> 57:37.043
"I used to think I had
the answers to everything...

57:37.210 --> 57:39.629
but now I know that life
doesn't always go my way.

57:39.712 --> 57:43.549
It feels like I'm caught in the
middle, and that's when I realize...

57:43.633 --> 57:47.053
that I'm not a girl,
and not yet a woman.

57:47.136 --> 57:50.973
All I need is time,
just a moment that's mine.

57:51.057 --> 57:54.310
And while I'm in between,
I'm not a girl."

57:58.815 --> 58:00.149
I liked it.

58:00.316 --> 58:01.901
Really?.

58:01.985 --> 58:04.070
Yeah, really, I like it.

58:08.825 --> 58:12.161
- What?.
- You got ash on your face.

58:12.245 --> 58:14.247
- Where?.
- I'll get it.

58:14.330 --> 58:16.249
There.

58:25.174 --> 58:26.926
- What's wrong?.
- What happened?.

58:27.010 --> 58:29.262
Something bit my ass.

58:29.345 --> 58:32.348
- Let me see.
- It's a snake bite.

58:32.515 --> 58:34.350
No, Mimi,
that's a mosquito bite.

58:36.519 --> 58:38.354
Don't look!

58:38.521 --> 58:41.858
- How could I not?. It's nothing.
- But it could've been a snake.

58:42.025 --> 58:44.694
All right! We are outta here
at the crack of dawn.

58:44.861 --> 58:47.363
Nothing's biting my ass.

58:50.116 --> 58:52.285
So we'll be in Tucson today?.

58:52.368 --> 58:55.288
- Around 4:00, I think.
- Are you nervous?.

58:55.371 --> 58:59.208
Should I call and tell her I'm
coming, or should I just show up?.

58:59.292 --> 59:02.295
- I should just show up, right?.
- Surprise is always better.

59:02.378 --> 59:05.548
She's gonna be
real happy to see you.

59:05.715 --> 59:07.216
I hope so.

59:21.064 --> 59:24.484
You'll call and tell me everything
about the audition, right?.

59:24.567 --> 59:28.821
-You could still come with us.
-We don't leave town until tomorrow.

59:28.905 --> 59:31.074
I'll be fine, okay?.

59:31.157 --> 59:34.327
You know where we're staying
ifyou need us.

59:35.411 --> 59:37.664
Bye.

59:41.167 --> 59:43.670
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

59:43.753 --> 59:45.922
I guess this is it.

59:48.841 --> 59:50.760
I guess, yeah.

59:50.843 --> 59:52.845
What?.

59:58.768 --> 01:00:01.688
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:00:13.282 --> 01:00:15.201
Can I help you?.

01:00:15.284 --> 01:00:18.287
It's me, Mama-- Lucy.

01:00:20.707 --> 01:00:22.291
Come in.

01:00:36.055 --> 01:00:37.807
You have a really nice house.

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.226
Thankyou, Lucy.

01:00:54.157 --> 01:00:56.326
Tucson seems like
a really nice city.

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:58.244
It is.

01:00:59.396 --> 01:01:03.082
Can I ask you
why you're here, Lucy?

01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:06.586
I wanted to see you.

01:01:06.753 --> 01:01:08.755
And why was that, Lucy?.

01:01:10.423 --> 01:01:12.342
Well, you're my mother.

01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:24.354
Why do you keep
saying my name like that?.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.445
Hold on a moment.

01:01:40.203 --> 01:01:42.372
Hello?.

01:01:42.455 --> 01:01:45.041
Sweetie, tell Joey's mommy I said
you could swim for another hour...

01:01:45.124 --> 01:01:46.959
ifyou put on more sunscreen.

01:01:47.126 --> 01:01:48.961
I don't want you to burn.

01:01:49.045 --> 01:01:52.131
Daddy will pickyou up at 5:00.
I love you.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.728
- I have brothers?.
- Well, yes.

01:02:05.812 --> 01:02:09.983
- How old are they?.
- Ten and seven.

01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:13.820
Do they know about me?.

01:02:17.156 --> 01:02:21.244
Lucy, I think we need
to have a talk.

01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:29.252
Whoa
Wait, seven, eight.

01:02:29.419 --> 01:02:31.337
Five, six--

01:02:48.104 --> 01:02:49.522
Come on in. Here.

01:02:49.605 --> 01:02:51.524
- What happened?.
- What's wrong?.

01:02:51.607 --> 01:02:54.444
- Get some towels, please?.
- I'm fine.

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:57.697
So, Luce, you got to see
your mom, right?.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.035
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And what happened?.

01:03:20.386 --> 01:03:22.638
Just thought you might want
some dry clothes.

01:03:22.722 --> 01:03:24.641
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:03:27.644 --> 01:03:29.479
I'm fine.

01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:31.481
I'm okay.

01:03:35.068 --> 01:03:37.320
I know.

01:03:39.322 --> 01:03:41.157
Really, I'm okay.

01:03:53.419 --> 01:03:56.005
What happened?.

01:04:02.178 --> 01:04:04.097
She said...

01:04:05.682 --> 01:04:07.600
that she never wanted me.

01:04:12.522 --> 01:04:17.777
She said that my father
made her have me...

01:04:19.278 --> 01:04:22.365
and that I was
just a mistake.

01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:44.220
I look like her, you know?.

01:04:45.638 --> 01:04:49.309
I have her eyes and her hands.

01:04:49.392 --> 01:04:51.644
It's her loss, Luce.

01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:55.148
It's weird though, you know?.

01:04:56.899 --> 01:04:58.818
I don't have a mother.

01:04:58.901 --> 01:05:00.653
Well, you have us.

01:05:00.737 --> 01:05:02.488
Yeah.

01:05:20.423 --> 01:05:22.675
Trying to call your dad?.

01:05:22.759 --> 01:05:25.928
I can't.
I will in a minute.

01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:27.680
You got that poem
you read me?.

01:05:28.765 --> 01:05:30.850
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?.

01:05:30.933 --> 01:05:33.019
Yeah, sure.

01:05:33.102 --> 01:05:36.272
It's right here.

01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:41.444
What are you doing?.

01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:46.032
Stop worrying so much.
Come on. I made you something.

01:05:46.115 --> 01:05:47.450
Okay.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:55.124
This is my surprise?.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:57.377
Wouldn't it be sad if it was?.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.046
Like if I just totally sucked
at cheering people up.

01:06:02.715 --> 01:06:05.551
I wrote some music
foryour poem.

01:06:08.137 --> 01:06:10.139
Will you play it for me?.

01:06:10.223 --> 01:06:12.141
Will you sing?.

01:06:17.647 --> 01:06:20.483
Just use this part
as the chorus.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:35.581
- Yeah.
- Like that?.

01:06:55.852 --> 01:06:59.522
Go my way
Like that?.

01:07:01.774 --> 01:07:05.778
It feels like I'm caught
in the middle

01:07:05.945 --> 01:07:07.780
A little low there.

01:07:07.947 --> 01:07:12.452
That's when I realize

01:07:12.535 --> 01:07:15.955
I'm not a girl

01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:21.711
And not yet a woman

01:07:25.381 --> 01:07:28.634
All I need is time

01:07:28.718 --> 01:07:32.055
A moment that is mine

01:07:32.138 --> 01:07:36.392
While I'm in between

01:07:36.476 --> 01:07:40.396
I'm not a girl

01:07:50.907 --> 01:07:52.742
Thank you.

01:07:54.494 --> 01:07:56.412
It's no trouble at all.

01:08:39.788 --> 01:08:43.542
Hello, you have reached Pete
and Lucy. Please leave a message.

01:08:45.044 --> 01:08:50.550
Hi, Pop. I'm just calling to say
that I'm fine, okay?.

01:08:50.633 --> 01:08:55.721
And you were right about Mama.
You were right.

01:08:55.805 --> 01:09:01.310
I love you, okay?.
I'm fine. Bye.

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:12.238
I'm not the kind ofgirl
you take home

01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:17.076
Ifit makesyou happy

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.331
It can't be that bad

01:09:21.413 --> 01:09:26.669
Ifit makesyou happy

01:09:26.752 --> 01:09:30.756
Then why the hell
are you so sad

01:09:32.258 --> 01:09:37.180
Ifit makesyou happy

01:09:37.263 --> 01:09:42.018
It can 't be that bad

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.773
Ifit makesyou happy

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:51.778
Then why the hell
are you so sad

01:10:31.234 --> 01:10:33.569
It's too cold. It's freezing!

01:10:37.991 --> 01:10:39.993
Don't even! Don't.

01:10:42.245 --> 01:10:45.498
- I can't believe we're here.
- I know.

01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:51.087
Ben, you know, there are
a lot of colleges here in L.A.

01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:56.676
Hey, what if I didn't go back?.

01:10:56.759 --> 01:11:00.596
I could go to school here.
I mean...

01:11:00.763 --> 01:11:05.101
why don't I do something
for me for once, you know?.

01:11:05.184 --> 01:11:07.186
I wanna stay.

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:09.188
I'm gonna stay.

01:11:12.025 --> 01:11:13.943
Good.

01:11:14.027 --> 01:11:17.280
Look how happy she is.

01:11:22.702 --> 01:11:27.498
Fill this out, turn it in over
there. The audition is in six days.

01:11:27.623 --> 01:11:29.876
Wait. Where do we turn it in?.

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:32.962
You turn it in over there.

01:11:33.046 --> 01:11:35.214
Fill this out--

01:11:35.298 --> 01:11:38.217
- What about music?.
- You know what?.

01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:41.596
I'll get some flyers printed up.
I know a few guys in L.A.

01:11:41.721 --> 01:11:44.390
I'll try to put a band together,
and I'll see you at the hotel.

01:11:44.474 --> 01:11:47.977
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, where you going?.

01:11:58.738 --> 01:12:02.659
Baby?. Hi, it's me!
Guess where I am.

01:12:02.742 --> 01:12:04.661
L.A.!

01:12:06.746 --> 01:12:09.123
Okay. All right.
Then I'll come to you.

01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:13.294
All right.
Then how 'bout tonight?.

01:12:16.673 --> 01:12:19.092
Then how 'bout
tomorrow morning?.

01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:24.806
Dylan, I'm in Los Angeles!

01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:27.600
I came to see you!

01:12:29.686 --> 01:12:31.604
Fine.

01:12:32.647 --> 01:12:34.691
What am I gonna say?.
Fine.

01:12:36.818 --> 01:12:38.695
Me too.

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:50.331
He's really busy with finals
and all. Yeah.

01:12:50.373 --> 01:12:52.125
We're fine.

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.130
So who wants to go sightseeing?.

01:12:57.213 --> 01:13:00.049
- I do!
- Okay! All right. Lucy?.

01:13:01.384 --> 01:13:03.219
I'm kinda tired.

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:08.641
Yeah, I'm pretty beat.

01:13:08.808 --> 01:13:11.269
Well, I need you.
We can't drive your car, remember?.

01:13:13.271 --> 01:13:14.981
Don't wreck it.

01:13:15.064 --> 01:13:17.066
All right!

01:13:27.076 --> 01:13:29.120
Wait, we're on Melrose--

01:13:29.329 --> 01:13:32.415
I thought we were going
to see the Hollywood sign.

01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:36.336
- We will.
- But I think it's back that way.

01:13:36.419 --> 01:13:39.756
I know. But we're gonna
make a stop first, okay?.

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:43.343
Kit, you can
see Dylan tomorrow.

01:13:45.511 --> 01:13:47.513
- Kit, come on. Let's go back.
- No.

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:51.893
- Kit, let's go back. Please!
- No! I want to see him now.

01:14:06.783 --> 01:14:08.701
Are you sure?.

01:14:09.786 --> 01:14:11.704
Yeah.

01:14:53.997 --> 01:14:55.915
Kit, I really should wait
in the car.

01:14:57.917 --> 01:15:00.837
- How do I look?.
- You look really great.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.172
Don't you guys want
to be alone together?.

01:15:05.008 --> 01:15:08.761
I want you with me.
Come on.

01:15:19.022 --> 01:15:21.441
- Surprise!
- Honey.

01:15:21.566 --> 01:15:24.277
Hi! Oh, baby.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.779
Kit-Kat, I thought we were
gonna make plans tomorrow.

01:15:26.863 --> 01:15:30.616
Oh, I know. I just really wanted
to see you. This is my friend, Mimi.

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:35.955
You two know each other?.

01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:38.124
Yeah. From school.
Right, Mimi?.

01:15:38.207 --> 01:15:41.377
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:47.091
Oh. Well, aren't you gonna
invite us in?.

01:15:47.216 --> 01:15:50.970
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I've
got this friend here, and he's--

01:15:51.054 --> 01:15:52.847
you know, he's really upset,
and we're supposed to, like...

01:15:52.972 --> 01:15:54.932
you know,
hang out or whatever.

01:15:56.309 --> 01:15:58.561
Do you need money for the pizza?.

01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:04.275
- Your friend sounds really upset.
- Wait, Kit, hold on.

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:09.322
- Oh, God.
- Who's she?.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.701
We're supposed to be
getting married.

01:16:15.578 --> 01:16:17.664
We're supposed to be
getting married.

01:16:17.747 --> 01:16:20.583
I was-- I was gonna tell you,
I just, you know...

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:23.002
didn't want to do it
over the phone.

01:16:23.086 --> 01:16:24.504
Dylan, you gave me a ring.

01:16:24.587 --> 01:16:27.507
You proposed and gave me a ring!

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:29.342
Kit, I mean,
I'm sorry, you know?.

01:16:37.183 --> 01:16:39.519
Oh, my God.

01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.028
It was Dylan, wasn't it?.

01:16:50.697 --> 01:16:53.199
It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas.

01:16:53.324 --> 01:16:57.286
- Wasn't it?. It was him, huh?.
- What are you talking about?.

01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:01.541
That night when you came over,
you had that rip in your shirt.

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:05.461
- That was the night that he--
- Kit, what is your problem here?.

01:17:05.545 --> 01:17:10.133
- Kit, I have to go.
- No, Mimi, come back here.

01:17:10.216 --> 01:17:13.970
I want him to admit it.
Admit it!

01:17:14.053 --> 01:17:17.307
You're getting all worked up
over nothing, Kitty-Kat.

01:17:18.975 --> 01:17:22.020
My name is not Kitty-Kat.
I am not your pet!

01:17:52.091 --> 01:17:53.509
Hello?.

01:18:09.776 --> 01:18:12.695
- Excuse me, where's the phone?.
- It's right over there.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.039
Yeah, can I make
a collect call, please?.

01:18:42.266 --> 01:18:44.894
They said I lost the baby.

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.730
"Lost it."

01:18:48.815 --> 01:18:52.151
Like it was my keys
or something.

01:18:54.487 --> 01:18:57.907
Isn't that the stupidest
damn thing you've ever heard?.

01:19:02.245 --> 01:19:04.330
I'd decided to keep her.

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:10.086
I was standing on the beach...

01:19:10.169 --> 01:19:15.133
and my toes were
in the Pacific Ocean...

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:19.429
and she kicked.

01:19:22.015 --> 01:19:24.100
It was like this sign.

01:19:25.518 --> 01:19:27.645
Don't touch me, Luce.
I'm already crying.

01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:29.939
Okay.

01:19:32.191 --> 01:19:34.277
I would have made a good mom.

01:19:43.202 --> 01:19:45.538
Just what were you thinking,
running away...

01:19:45.621 --> 01:19:48.458
with a pregnant girl!

01:19:48.499 --> 01:19:50.460
Lucy, I'm waiting
for an answer.

01:19:50.543 --> 01:19:53.129
Do you know what it took
to come here?.

01:19:53.171 --> 01:19:56.549
I had to take cash out of savings
for plane fare and hotel.

01:19:56.632 --> 01:20:00.136
I worked hard to earn that money
for your college education.

01:20:00.219 --> 01:20:01.638
I'm sorry.

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.147
So you made a mistake.
I understand.

01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:16.903
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're forgiven.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.405
I'm gonna take you girls back
to where you belong...

01:20:19.489 --> 01:20:22.241
and we'll forget about
this whole crazy thing, all right?.

01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:24.243
Okay.

01:20:24.327 --> 01:20:26.245
Who's that boy you were with?.

01:20:26.412 --> 01:20:29.666
How old is he anyway?. Is he the one
who put the crazy idea in your head?.

01:20:33.169 --> 01:20:35.505
He just gave us a ride.

01:20:35.588 --> 01:20:37.840
That's all.

01:20:43.846 --> 01:20:46.516
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
We got a band.

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:51.187
- What are you doing?.
- Packing.

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:55.858
My father says I have
to move to his hotel, so--

01:20:55.942 --> 01:20:59.779
Until the audition?.
How are we gonna rehearse?.

01:20:59.862 --> 01:21:02.115
I'm not going to the audition.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:10.331
Look, I have to
go back with him, okay?.

01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:15.878
Ben, he's my father, okay?.

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:17.714
I just can't--

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.719
And with everything happening
with Mimi, I just think I should go.

01:21:25.805 --> 01:21:28.224
- No, I get it.
- Don't be like that.

01:21:29.392 --> 01:21:31.311
I get it. It's okay.

01:21:32.812 --> 01:21:34.314
It's fine.

01:22:13.603 --> 01:22:16.439
Did you see
how fast he went down?.

01:22:18.107 --> 01:22:22.820
It's 'cause you threw your body
into that punch, like I taught you.

01:22:26.449 --> 01:22:28.117
You did really good.

01:22:31.454 --> 01:22:32.955
Hey, come here.

01:22:34.457 --> 01:22:36.125
Thankyou.

01:22:41.381 --> 01:22:44.884
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:46.970
It's not your fault.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.528
Got it?.

01:23:10.076 --> 01:23:12.495
I can't believe
this trip is over.

01:23:12.662 --> 01:23:15.748
I know. God, doesn't it feel like
we left home a million years ago?.

01:23:15.832 --> 01:23:17.750
Yeah.

01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:23.423
- Hey, y'all, thanks.
- For what?.

01:23:23.506 --> 01:23:27.844
For coming on this trip with me.
Thankyou.

01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:32.724
Mimi and I were talking...

01:23:32.849 --> 01:23:33.975
and we were thinking--

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.769
That you need to stay
and go to the audition.

01:23:36.853 --> 01:23:39.355
Guys, I can't do that.

01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:41.441
- I can't.
- You've got to.

01:23:41.524 --> 01:23:44.360
Kit and I voted, and you lost,
so you've got to go.

01:23:49.615 --> 01:23:52.994
All right, baby,
ready to head home?.

01:23:53.119 --> 01:23:56.539
- I'm coming.
- Ladies...

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:58.207
let's roll.

01:24:01.461 --> 01:24:03.463
Come on, let's go.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.719
We tried.

01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:13.556
Here you go, buddy.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.059
- Thankyou, sir.
- I'll take that, sweetie.

01:24:24.984 --> 01:24:26.152
Good-bye, Lucy.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.655
Good-bye.

01:25:01.187 --> 01:25:06.109
It's gonna feel good
to get back home, won't it?.

01:25:06.192 --> 01:25:07.777
Look, honey...

01:25:09.112 --> 01:25:11.864
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:25:11.948 --> 01:25:15.535
I wasn't angry at you.
I was angry at what you did.

01:25:15.702 --> 01:25:17.704
- Okay?.
- Okay.

01:25:28.131 --> 01:25:30.800
I don't want to be like her.

01:25:30.883 --> 01:25:34.554
We'll just get back home, and
everything'll be back to normal.

01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:36.639
You just wait and see.

01:25:37.974 --> 01:25:40.393
Don't make me do
what she did.

01:25:41.728 --> 01:25:46.899
Don't make me run.
Just let me go, okay?.

01:25:58.828 --> 01:26:01.289
What are you--

01:26:01.414 --> 01:26:03.583
I used to think

01:26:04.667 --> 01:26:09.088
I had the answers
to everything

01:26:12.592 --> 01:26:16.387
But now I know

01:26:16.512 --> 01:26:19.766
That life doesn't always

01:26:19.849 --> 01:26:23.436
Go my way

01:26:23.603 --> 01:26:25.021
Yeah

01:26:25.104 --> 01:26:30.526
Feels like I'm caught
in the middle

01:26:31.611 --> 01:26:36.699
That's when I realize

01:26:36.783 --> 01:26:40.203
I'm not a girl

01:26:43.373 --> 01:26:45.875
Not yet a woman

01:26:49.462 --> 01:26:52.340
All I need is time

01:26:52.465 --> 01:26:56.636
A moment that is mine

01:26:56.719 --> 01:27:00.556
While I'm in between

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.267
I'm not a girl

01:27:05.311 --> 01:27:09.524
There is no need
to protect me

01:27:13.236 --> 01:27:16.406
It's time that I

01:27:16.489 --> 01:27:19.993
L earned to face up to this

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:25.832
On my own

01:27:25.915 --> 01:27:32.255
I've seen so much more
than you know now

01:27:32.338 --> 01:27:37.260
So don 't tell me
to shut my eyes

01:28:06.205 --> 01:28:11.377
But ifyou look at me closely

01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:14.672
You will see it in my eyes

01:28:14.714 --> 01:28:20.470
This girl will always find

01:28:20.553 --> 01:28:25.975
Her way

01:28:27.894 --> 01:28:32.482
I'm not a girl
Don 't tell me what to believe

01:28:34.651 --> 01:28:38.821
I'm just trying to find
the woman in me, yeah

01:29:09.852 --> 01:29:11.187
My baby!

01:29:26.035 --> 01:29:29.288
This time, we didn 't make
any wishes for the future.

01:29:31.207 --> 01:29:33.960
We said good-bye to our past.

01:29:34.043 --> 01:29:37.630
Now, none of us has any idea
where life's gonna take us...

01:29:37.714 --> 01:29:39.966
'cause what we have is now.

01:29:41.759 --> 01:29:43.553
And right now,
we have each other.

01:30:13.124 --> 01:30:15.918
- Let's do this thing!
- Action!
