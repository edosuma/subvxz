FROM JEOPARDY]

12:11.698 --> 12:13.233
ONE DAY SOUNDS GOOD.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.401
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

12:14.467 --> 12:17.437
I'LL PICK YOU UP
TOMORROW MORNING AT 8:00.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.741
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TRUST ME
AND DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.512
UH-OH.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.516
UH-OH.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.126
CARL, ARE YOU OKAY?

12:39.192 --> 12:43.363
OH, FINE. YOU EXPECT ME
TO GO UP IN A HOT AIR BALLOON?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.932
YEP.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.134
BYE.
WAIT, CARL.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.103
YOU GOTTA GO UP
IN THAT THING.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.638
NO, I DON'T.
YES, YOU DO.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.474
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO
GET OVER YOUR FEAR OF HEIGHTS.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.110
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU DON'T
CONQUER THIS PHOBIA,

12:57.177 --> 12:59.312
YOU CAN KISS
YOUR BADGE GOODBYE.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.961
DON'T THESE THINGS
GO REALLY, REALLY HIGH?

13:14.027 --> 13:17.464
WE'LL TRY AROUND 5,000 FEET.
5,000--

13:17.530 --> 13:19.699
CAN'T GO MUCH HIGHER
THAN THAT WITHOUT OXYGEN.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.001
OTHERWISE YOUR
HEAD WILL EXPLODE.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.871
BYE.
WAIT, CARL, CARL, CARL!

13:23.937 --> 13:25.906
OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
WE'RE READY TO GO.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.708
YOU HEAR THAT, CARL.
IT'S LIFT-OFF TIME.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.243
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
COME ON.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.313
HI, I'M JIMMY "WILD
BLUE YONDER" PHILLIPS.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.850
HI, I'M CARL
"YELLOWBELLY" WINSLOW.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.419
OH. IS THIS
YOUR FIRST TIME UP?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.487
YEAH.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.890
YEAH. MINE, TOO.

13:42.956 --> 13:43.957
BYE.
WAIT, CARL!

13:44.024 --> 13:46.126
NO, NO. I'M KIDDING.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.728
YOU HAVE A FEAR
OF HEIGHTS, AREN'T YOU?

13:48.795 --> 13:50.463
WELL...YES, I DO.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.499
YOU'RE NOT MY FIRST CUSTOMER
WITH THAT PROBLEM.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.668
LET ME ASSURE YOU, HOT AIR
BALLOONING IS A COMPLETELY SAFE

13:55.735 --> 13:57.237
AND RISK-FREE ACTIVITY.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.673
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS CLIMB IN?

14:00.740 --> 14:03.877
MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.316
I AM NOT GETTING IN
WITH THAT ON HIS HEAD.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.154
PARTY POOPER.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.859
COME ON, BIG GUY.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.632
COME ON.

14:28.768 --> 14:32.405
GOOD. I'M JUST GOING TO GET
MY MAPS AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.276
OOPS. WRONG WAY.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.890
WELL, GEE, I WONDER
WHAT THIS DOES.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.228
STEVE! STEVE! STEVE!

14:55.295 --> 14:59.199
OH, IT MAKES IT GO UP.
RIGHT. NOW MAKE IT GO DOWN!

14:59.933 --> 15:02.002
OKAY.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.438
MAYBE IF I PULL IT AGAIN,
IT WILL GO DOWN.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.309
STEVE! STEVE!

15:09.376 --> 15:12.179
NOPE. IT SEEMS
TO BE A ONE WAY DEAL.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.114
I GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

15:14.181 --> 15:16.283
CARL, YOU'LL SNAP A KNEECAP.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.986
BESIDES, I THINK
I GOT IT FIGURED OUT.

15:19.052 --> 15:23.256
IT MUST BE ONE PULL FOR UP
AND TWO PULLS FOR DOWN.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.457
OKAY.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.561
STEVE!
IT'S STUCK.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.729
STEVE!
IT'S STUCK.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.331
AAH!

15:47.314 --> 15:49.182
AAH!

15:50.817 --> 15:53.253
AAH! OH.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.794
GOOD NEWS, CARL.
THE ROPE IS UNSTUCK.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.364
GET US DOWN!
GET US DOWN!

16:04.431 --> 16:07.100
I'M STILL
WORKING ON THAT.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.536
YOU SHOULD OPEN YOUR EYES
AND LOOK AROUND.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.539
WHY, THIS VIEW WILL
TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.556
IT'S MINE!

16:29.622 --> 16:30.823
MINE, MINE!

16:30.890 --> 16:32.559
THE D.J. ASKED FOR
HARRIETTE WINSLOW.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.627
AND THAT'S WHY
THE CAR BELONGS TO ME.

16:34.694 --> 16:38.465
FOR THE LAST TIME, THE CAR
BELONGS TO ME. AND YOU KNOW WHY?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.368
BECAUSE I LOOK BETTER IN RED.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.137
WELL, RED DOES
BRING OUT YOUR EYES.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.041
ALRIGHT. THAT DID IT,
SHORTSTUFF. I HAVE--

16:48.108 --> 16:49.676
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, RACHEL.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.078
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

16:51.144 --> 16:53.380
HOLD IT, GANG!
HOLD IT!

16:54.747 --> 16:57.016
YOU TWO
SHOULD BE ASHAMED,

16:57.084 --> 16:59.819
ACTING LIKE
CHUCKLEHEADS.

16:59.886 --> 17:03.723
LAY IT ON 'EM,
GRANDMA!

17:03.790 --> 17:05.792
SORRY.
I GOT EMOTIONAL.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.994
NOW YOU BOTH
KNOW PERFECTLY WELL

17:08.061 --> 17:11.431
THERE ARE THINGS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN A SILLY CAR...

17:11.498 --> 17:14.033
LIKE FAMILY.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.503
YOU TWO ARE SISTERS.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.772
AND IF SOMETHING NICE HAPPENS TO
ONE, THE OTHER SHOULD BE HAPPY.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.578
SHE'S RIGHT.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.447
YOU CAN HAVE THE CAR.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.316
NO, HARRIETTE,
IT'S YOURS.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.952
AFTER ALL, THE RADIO STATION
DID CALL YOU, NOT ME.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.587
YEAH, BUT YOU GAVE
THE RIGHT ANSWER,

17:34.654 --> 17:39.058
SO STOP ARGUING
AND TAKE THE STUPID CAR.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.029
WAIT A MINUTE!

17:43.096 --> 17:45.098
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THE STUPID CAR.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.934
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
I CAN BE AS UNSELFISH AS YOU.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.169
IN A PIG'S EYE.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.803
WHO ARE YOU
CALLING A PIG?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.972
YOU, RACHEL.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.441
NOW STOP THIS!

17:55.675 --> 17:58.811
YOU TWO ARE FIGHTING
LIKE DOGS OVER A BONE.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.815
JUST SELL THE CAR

18:02.882 --> 18:05.785
AND SPLIT
THE MONEY 50/50.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.122
NOW THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.357
THE BEST.
LET'S GO CELEBRATE.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.059
HEY, LET'S GO SHOPPING.

I'M GLAD
THAT'S OVER.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.304

HE'LL BE HAPPY, TOO.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.839
YEAH. HE'S OUT WITH STEVE.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.476

AAH!

18:38.285 --> 18:41.521
OKAY, WE'RE DOING
MUCH BETTER.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.592

WAS MUCH SHORTER.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.895
NOW LOOK DOWN AGAIN,
ONLY A LITTLE LONGER THIS TIME.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.302
VERY GOOD, CARL.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.452
RELAX, CARL.

WHEN THE AIR INSIDE
THE BALLOON COOLS SUFFICIENTLY,

19:15.054 --> 19:16.356
WE'LL BEGIN TO DESCEND.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.990
NOW, WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE OR WHEN,
