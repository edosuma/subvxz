We haven't been
properly introduced.

00:16.928 --> 00:18.800
I'm Buffy and you're

00:18.844 --> 00:20.846
history![groans]

00:22.239 --> 00:25.068
Poor technique.
Prioritizing, subpar.

00:25.111 --> 00:27.809
Execution was adequate,

00:27.853 --> 00:30.638
but a bit too bloody
for my taste.

00:30.681 --> 00:32.857
Giles, don't mention it.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.557
It was my pleasure to make the
world safe for humanity again.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.472
I'm not saying that your methods
are without merit.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.561
It's... You're spending
too much time and energy.

00:39.603 --> 00:41.258
It should simply be plunge

00:41.301 --> 00:42.911
and move on,
plunge and--

00:42.954 --> 00:44.957
Hello.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.354
Oh!

00:51.399 --> 00:53.835
That's great-- I kill them,
you fence their stuff.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.969
What is it?

00:57.012 --> 00:58.841
I don't know.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.494
But it bothers you?

01:00.537 --> 01:03.671
Yes... I thought this vampire
was just on a random kill,

01:03.715 --> 01:05.716
but it may be something else.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.109
Something big?

01:07.153 --> 01:10.331
Yes.
I best consult my books.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.118
"And there will be
a time of crisis,

01:16.162 --> 01:19.079

will not know him,

01:30.263 --> 01:32.439
"will not stop him,

01:32.483 --> 01:36.356
and he will
lead her into Hell."

01:36.400 --> 01:38.662
As it is written,

01:38.706 --> 01:40.664
so shall it be.

01:58.073 --> 02:00.337

02:00.381 --> 02:04.688

so shall it be.

before he ate."

02:16.179 --> 02:18.659
Oh, wait.

02:20.443 --> 02:23.533
That's not written anywhere.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.667
[wheezing]

02:25.710 --> 02:29.323
The Anointed will be my greatest
weapon against The Slayer.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.628
If you fail
to bring him to me,

02:31.673 --> 02:35.329
if you allow that girl
to stop you...

02:41.682 --> 02:43.685
Here endeth the lesson.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.965
GILES:
That symbol on the ring--

03:47.009 --> 03:48.706
I believe it's
the rune for fidelity,

03:48.750 --> 03:51.405
but, um, that doesn't connect
with any of the sects

03:51.448 --> 03:53.449
that I've studied.

03:53.493 --> 03:55.365
What about this?

03:55.408 --> 03:58.106
On the inside,
it's a sun and three stars.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.456
Haven't we seen
that somewhere?

03:59.500 --> 04:00.848
Let me see.

04:04.634 --> 04:05.854
Well, I-I don't think this, um,

04:05.896 --> 04:07.420
represents any, uh--

04:07.463 --> 04:09.771
Wait, it's right here--
"Sun and Three Stars."

04:09.813 --> 04:11.772
[groans]
Check these guys out.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.340
I told you it looked familiar.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.168
Oh, The Order of Aurelius.

04:16.211 --> 04:17.257
[door opens]

04:17.300 --> 04:18.345
Yes, you're right.

04:18.387 --> 04:20.259
Ooh, two points for The Slayer,

04:20.302 --> 04:23.175
while The Watcher
has yet to score.

04:23.218 --> 04:25.829
Oh, Owen.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.223
Hi.

04:28.615 --> 04:30.356
What do you want?

04:30.399 --> 04:31.706
A book.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.273
Oh.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.665
See, this is a school,
and we have students,

04:35.709 --> 04:37.668
and they check out books,
and then they learn things.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.757
I was beginning
to suspect that was a myth.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.718
I lost my Emily... Dickinson.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.284
It's dumb, but

04:45.327 --> 04:48.288
I like her around,
kind of a security blanket.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.810
Oh, I have something like that.

04:49.853 --> 04:51.552
Well, it's an actual blanket.

04:51.595 --> 04:55.120
Oh, and I don't really
carry it around anym-more.

04:55.163 --> 04:56.860
So, Emily Dickens, huh?

04:56.904 --> 04:58.601
She's great.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.863
Dickinson.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.040
She's good also.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.519
Poetry.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.305
I didn't think

05:05.348 --> 05:06.610
I'd find youhere.

05:06.653 --> 05:09.134
Well, why not?

05:09.177 --> 05:10.701
I-I didn't mean,

05:10.745 --> 05:12.442
I mean...

05:12.485 --> 05:13.877
I think you can read.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.184
Oh, thanks.

05:15.226 --> 05:17.752
But you don't
seem bookworm-y,

05:17.795 --> 05:19.754
the type of person

05:19.797 --> 05:21.886
to lock themselves
in a dark room

05:21.930 --> 05:25.367
with a lot
of musty old books.

05:25.411 --> 05:27.151
Oh.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.285
And I've offended you.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.591
No!

05:30.634 --> 05:33.071
No, I'm just surprised

05:33.115 --> 05:35.334
you gave any thought
to what I'm like.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.336
You shouldn't be.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.297
Oh, well, I love books.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.387
I mean,
I reallylove books.

05:44.430 --> 05:45.562
What's this?

05:45.605 --> 05:46.737
Ooh, not this one!

05:46.781 --> 05:48.738
This one she
doesn't love.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.220
Oh, Emily Dickinson, hmm.

05:51.262 --> 05:53.396
We're both fans.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.223
Yes, she's quite
a good poet.

05:55.266 --> 05:56.529
I mean, for a--

05:56.572 --> 05:58.096
A girl?

05:58.139 --> 05:59.793
For, for an American.

05:59.836 --> 06:02.404
I'll, uh,
see you in math

06:02.449 --> 06:04.625
if I open my eyes
at some point.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.670
[chuckles]
Cool.

06:08.672 --> 06:12.197
The Order of Aurelius is a
very old and venerated sect.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.112
If they're here, it's
for a good reason.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.678
That was Owen.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.855
Yes, I remember.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.249
Do you have any more copies
of Emily Dickinson?

06:20.292 --> 06:22.468
I need one.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.687
Buffy, while the mere
fact of you wanting

06:24.731 --> 06:28.430
to check out a book would be
grounds for a national holiday,

06:28.475 --> 06:31.434
I think we should focus
on the problem at hand.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.305
Right,

06:33.348 --> 06:34.872
I'm sorry,
you're right.

06:34.915 --> 06:36.439
Vampires.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.745
Oh.

06:38.788 --> 06:41.225
Does this outfit
make me look fat?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.707
Owen Thurman was
talking to you?

06:44.752 --> 06:45.970
It's all true.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.755
Wow, he hardly
talks to anyone.

06:48.798 --> 06:50.713
He's solitary, mysterious.

06:50.757 --> 06:52.629
He can brood for
40 minutes straight.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.456
I've clocked him.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.197
He was so nice,
it was eerie.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.026
What did you guys
have to talk about?

06:58.069 --> 06:59.941
Emily Dickinson.

06:59.983 --> 07:02.160
He reads Emily Dickinson?

07:02.204 --> 07:04.598
He's sensitive,
yet manly.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.990
But wait, you've
never even read her.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.471
You vixen.

07:08.514 --> 07:10.341
[chuckles]

07:10.386 --> 07:13.040
Has anybody given any thought
to what this green stuff is?

07:13.084 --> 07:15.435
Mm, I'm avoiding the subject.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.699
I think it's kale...
or possibly string cheese.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.483
So, Buffy, how'd the slaying
go last night?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.528
Xander!

07:22.572 --> 07:25.531
I mean, how'd the laying go?

07:25.574 --> 07:28.012
No, I don't mean that, either.

07:28.055 --> 07:29.709
It went fine, thank you.

07:29.752 --> 07:31.886
There's some new hoity-toity
vampire sect in town.

07:31.928 --> 07:33.930
That's bad.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.324
Well, hey, they bring in
the much-needed tourist dollars.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.415
Ooh, look at Mr. Excitement.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.677
BUFFY: Owen.
He's all alone.

07:41.721 --> 07:44.899
Maybe somebody
should sit with him.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.117
Just to be polite.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.120
Good luck.

07:52.558 --> 07:54.473
Okay, what just happened?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.954
Look, an empty seat.

07:56.997 --> 07:58.216
Ooh!

07:58.259 --> 08:00.043
Oh.
Let me get that.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.567
Thanks.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.177
Boy, Cordelia's hips are wider

08:03.221 --> 08:05.833
than I thought.[chuckles]

08:05.875 --> 08:07.529
At least you don't have
to eat your soylent green.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.011
Owen, a bunch of us
are loitering

08:10.053 --> 08:11.315
at The Bronze tonight,
you there?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.317
Who all's going?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.146
Well, um, I'm gonna be there.

08:15.189 --> 08:16.538
Who else?

08:16.582 --> 08:18.584
You mean, besides me?

08:18.627 --> 08:20.108
Buffy, what about you?

08:20.151 --> 08:21.978
What?

08:22.023 --> 08:23.459
No, no, no.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.939
She, uh, she doesn't like fun.

08:25.983 --> 08:29.072
How about we meet
there at 8:00?

08:29.117 --> 08:31.771
Yeah.
8:00.

08:31.814 --> 08:34.296
There.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.558
It's not that big a deal.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.255
It's just a bunch of people
getting together.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.822
It's a very big deal!

08:39.866 --> 08:41.259
It's not.

08:41.302 --> 08:43.217
It is.
Tell her.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.827
I'm afraid
it's very big.

08:44.871 --> 08:46.394
Thank you.

08:46.437 --> 08:47.614
Wait.

08:47.657 --> 08:48.918
What are you
talking about?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.138
What are you
talking about?

08:50.181 --> 08:51.573
Boys.
Boys.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.923
Yes, well, I'm
talking about trouble.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.446
A violent and
disturbing prophecy

08:54.490 --> 08:55.883
is about to be
fulfilled.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.318
The Order of Aurelius.

08:57.361 --> 08:58.885
You were spot on
about the connection.

08:58.928 --> 09:01.715
I've looked at the writings
of Aurelius himself,

09:01.758 --> 09:04.152
and he, he prophesied that
the brethren of his order

09:04.195 --> 09:06.937
would come to The Master
and bring him The Anointed.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.982
Who's that?Well, I don't know exactly.

09:09.025 --> 09:11.072
A-A warrior, but it says

09:11.115 --> 09:13.029
he will rise
from the ashes of The Five

09:13.073 --> 09:15.597
on the evening of
the thousandth day

09:15.642 --> 09:17.600
after the Advent of Septus.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.774
Well, we'll be ready,
whenever it is.

09:18.818 --> 09:19.907
Which is tonight.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.342
Tonight, okay--
Not okay!

09:21.385 --> 09:22.909
It can't be tonight!

09:22.952 --> 09:24.519
My calculations are precise.

09:24.563 --> 09:25.913
They're bad calculations.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.349
Bad.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.654
Buffy has a really
important date.

09:28.697 --> 09:30.307
Owen!

09:30.351 --> 09:32.092
All right, I'll just jump
in my time machine,

09:32.135 --> 09:34.051
go back to the 12th century
and ask the vampires

09:34.095 --> 09:35.662
to postpone their
ancient prophecy

09:35.705 --> 09:38.011
for a few days while you
take in dinner and a show.

09:38.054 --> 09:41.188
Okay, at this point,
you're abusing sarcasm.

09:41.231 --> 09:43.104
Buffy, this is no
ordinary vampire,

09:43.147 --> 09:45.975
but we have to stop him
before he reaches The Master.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.934
But... cute guy.

09:47.977 --> 09:49.023
Teenager.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.154
Post-pubescent fantasies.

09:51.198 --> 09:53.418
Those will just
have to be put on hold.

09:53.461 --> 09:55.682
The dark forces
are aligning against us,

09:55.725 --> 09:57.726
and we have a chance
to beat them back.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.600
Tonight, we go into battle.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.037
[crickets trilling]

10:06.475 --> 10:08.432
Perhaps I miscalculated.

10:08.476 --> 10:10.913
I'm thinking yes.

10:10.957 --> 10:12.437
[slurping]

10:12.480 --> 10:15.178
Well, you know what they say.

10:15.222 --> 10:16.832
90% of the vampire

10:16.876 --> 10:19.182
slaying game is-is waiting.

10:19.226 --> 10:21.576
You couldn't have
told me that 90% ago?

10:21.620 --> 10:25.101
Well, we-we've certainly
waited here long enough.

10:25.145 --> 10:27.191
Besides, there aren't
any fresh graves.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.715
Who's gonna rise?

10:28.758 --> 10:31.847
Apparently, no one tonight.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.197
Then I can bail?

10:33.240 --> 10:34.677
I can go to The Bronze
and find Owen?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.113
Very well, then.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.028
Follow your hormones,
if you want.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.290
But I assume I don't
have to warn you about

10:40.335 --> 10:42.684
the hazards of becoming
personally involved

10:42.729 --> 10:46.036
with someone who's unaware
of your unique condition?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.821
Yeah, yeah, I read
the back of the box.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.388
If your identity
as a slayer is revealed,

10:50.432 --> 10:53.870
it could put you and all those
around you in grave danger.

10:53.913 --> 10:56.698
Well, in that case,
I won't wear my button

10:56.743 --> 10:59.179
that says,
"I'm a slayer, ask me how."

11:00.746 --> 11:03.009
Good night.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.450
"Five shall die,
and from their ashes,

11:08.493 --> 11:11.714
The Anointed shall rise."

11:11.758 --> 11:14.673
I was sure it was tonight.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.110
â™ª

11:33.822 --> 11:35.216
I went on an airplane.

11:35.259 --> 11:39.437
A pale horse emerged
with Death as its rider.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.961
You willbe judged.

11:42.004 --> 11:44.921
You will be judged.

11:46.356 --> 11:50.317
[indistinct chatter]

11:50.360 --> 11:53.974
â™ª It's real

11:55.975 --> 11:58.586
â™ª Then you wake up

11:58.629 --> 12:02.504
â™ª Shouting some

12:02.547 --> 12:03.809
â™ª Familiar name

12:03.852 --> 12:08.727
â™ª It's not the same

12:08.770 --> 12:12.687
â™ª You're just a girl...

12:16.692 --> 12:22.653
â™ª Just a girl
who knows no shame â™ª

12:24.655 --> 12:28.878
â™ª Whose desperate pace
has lost its taste â™ª

12:28.922 --> 12:31.533
â™ª And never-ending
darkness weighs â™ª

12:31.576 --> 12:34.665
â™ª I can't avoid,
I can't complain â™ª

12:34.710 --> 12:37.408
â™ª I know exactly
who's to blame â™ª

12:37.451 --> 12:41.543
â™ª The girl who shares my--

12:45.634 --> 12:48.418
That day's gonna bring fire.

12:48.462 --> 12:52.119
Fire coming down, judgment.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.687
Don't think you're ready,
ready to look upon him.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.341
If there's sin in there,
there's sin all around.

12:57.384 --> 13:00.779
It's a liquid.
On that day,

13:00.822 --> 13:03.173
there won't be anybody
telling us what to do

13:03.216 --> 13:06.001
or why we're doing it.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.830
You can't prepare.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.875
On that day--

13:09.918 --> 13:11.572
Hey, you got to sit down.

13:11.615 --> 13:13.618
Okay?

13:15.054 --> 13:18.231
Are you willing to stand
with the righteous?

13:20.147 --> 13:22.365
[horn honks]

13:22.409 --> 13:23.541
[brakes squeal]

13:23.585 --> 13:24.803
[woman screams]

13:39.209 --> 13:40.820
Is everyone okay?

13:42.298 --> 13:43.648
You okay?

13:43.692 --> 13:46.042
You all right?

13:57.096 --> 13:59.099
Are you all right?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.149
Can you move?

14:06.192 --> 14:08.020
[growls]

14:15.505 --> 14:17.508
[passengers screaming]

14:30.913 --> 14:32.480
So you just went home?

14:32.523 --> 14:34.264
What was I supposed to do?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.744
Say to Owen,
"Sorry I was late.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.745
"I was sitting in a cemetery
with the librarian

14:37.788 --> 14:39.790
"waiting for a vampire
to rise so I could prevent

14:39.835 --> 14:41.532
an evil prophesy
from coming to pass"?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.751
Or flat tire?

14:43.794 --> 14:45.448
I can't take this anymore.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.364
I feel like everyone
is staring at me--

14:47.408 --> 14:49.365
the big, hideous,
dateless monster.

14:49.409 --> 14:51.368
What? Yeah, that's right.
I have no life.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.803
Come on, there's nothing
to see here, pal.

14:52.847 --> 14:54.850
Move it along.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.071
You're acting a little overly,
aren't you?

14:58.114 --> 14:59.768
I mean, you could
have any guy in school.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.116
He's not any guy.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.076
He's more Owen-y.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.816
Sure, he's got
a certain Owen-osity,

15:04.860 --> 15:06.557
but that's not hard to find.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.908
I mean, a lot
of guys read.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.735
I can read.
[chuckles]

15:12.823 --> 15:14.739
Hey, Buffy.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.827
Owen.

15:16.871 --> 15:18.830
Oh, look, it's Owen.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.309
Buffy and Owen

15:20.354 --> 15:22.225
and Xander--
that be me.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.139
Where were you last night?

15:24.183 --> 15:25.706
Oh.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.404
Well, um, my watch broke.

15:28.448 --> 15:30.754
And we don't have
any clocks in our house,

15:30.798 --> 15:33.235
and so I didn't know what time
it was or even what day it was.

15:33.279 --> 15:35.586
I thought I was the only one
that happened to.

15:35.629 --> 15:38.459
How about we try it
again for tonight?

15:38.501 --> 15:41.288
I'll even lend
you my watch.

15:44.203 --> 15:46.423
Tonight?
Y-You and me?

15:46.466 --> 15:49.904
Well, we could invite
the chess club, but

15:49.948 --> 15:52.168
they drink,
and they start fights.

15:52.211 --> 15:53.517
Oh, no,
It's just--

15:53.561 --> 15:55.955
Well, I sort of heard...

15:55.998 --> 15:58.913
that you and Cordelia
were somewhat

15:58.957 --> 16:02.004
all over each other...
uh, a little.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.440
I danced with her
a couple of times.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.138
She's kind of grabby.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.052
Well, let's see.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.446
If I rearrange that,
and I push that to n--

16:09.490 --> 16:11.971
Sure!
Tonight'll work.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.537
Great, I'll pick
you up at 7:00?

16:13.581 --> 16:14.668
Um...

16:14.711 --> 16:16.105
7:00.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.802
That's when the
little hand's there.

16:18.846 --> 16:21.631
Oh, between
the six and the eight.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.025
Um, I'll see you then.

16:28.073 --> 16:29.162
Tonight!

16:29.205 --> 16:31.120
Isn't that so...?

16:31.163 --> 16:32.469
What?

16:32.513 --> 16:34.950
Me and Owen.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.432
Yeah.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.000
So it is.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.220
It sure is so.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.657
[sighs]

16:50.618 --> 16:51.966
Hey, how's it going?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.794
Uh, all right.
That's great.

16:53.837 --> 16:56.318
I see we're still working
on that "Anointed One" problem.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.841
That'll probably
take a few days, right?

16:57.885 --> 16:59.713
I mean, that's
one obscure prophesy.

16:59.756 --> 17:01.280
Yes, well, there are quite
a few interpretations.

17:01.323 --> 17:02.846
So, tonight's looking
pretty slow, right?

17:02.890 --> 17:04.153
Probably best
to relax and regroup.

17:04.195 --> 17:05.935
No big disasters coming.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.329
That is so good.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.549
I will see you
tomorrow, then, bye!

17:11.726 --> 17:14.858
She is the strangest girl.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.252
You have done well.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.865
Everything is in place.

17:20.909 --> 17:24.086
When this night's work is done,

17:24.130 --> 17:26.784
I will have
a mighty ally.

17:26.827 --> 17:29.003
I'll be one step closer
to freeing myself

17:29.048 --> 17:32.528
from this mystical prison.

17:36.010 --> 17:39.275
I've been trapped
down here so long,

17:39.318 --> 17:42.191
I've nearly forgotten
what it's like on the surface.

17:42.234 --> 17:45.846
Oh, there will be
time enough to remember...

17:45.890 --> 17:48.197
when I rule it.

17:49.154 --> 17:52.114
If she tries to stop you,

17:52.157 --> 17:53.333
kill her.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.465
Give your own lives,
but do not fail

17:56.509 --> 17:58.990
to bring The Anointed.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.689
I know you won't disappoint me.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.387
Bug.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.566
Pick.
Okay.

18:09.609 --> 18:12.178
Do I want to appear
shy, coy and naive?

18:12.221 --> 18:15.833
Or unrestrained,
insatiable and aggressive?

18:15.876 --> 18:17.922
You know, Owen
is a little homespun.

18:17.965 --> 18:20.795
He probably doesn't like
that overly assertive look.

18:20.837 --> 18:23.537
Oh, hey, here's something.

18:23.579 --> 18:27.148
A nice comfy overcoat
and a ski cap.

18:27.192 --> 18:29.019
The earflaps will
bring out your eyes.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.761
Maybe I should mix and match.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.894
Okay, guy's opinion.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.723
Which one do you think
Owen will like better--

18:36.767 --> 18:38.028
the red or the peach?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.509
Oh, you mean

18:39.552 --> 18:40.902
for kissing you
and then telling

18:40.944 --> 18:42.685
all his friends
how easy you are,

18:42.730 --> 18:44.210
so the whole school
loses respect for you

18:44.252 --> 18:46.167
and then talks
behind your back.

18:46.211 --> 18:47.430
The red's fine.

18:47.473 --> 18:49.476
Thanks.
I'll go with the peach.

18:51.781 --> 18:54.654
Here, put this on.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.613
You're not bothering me.

19:00.922 --> 19:01.878
So where's he taking you?

19:01.923 --> 19:03.445
Oh, I don't know.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.622
Where do you suppose young kids
go on dates these days?

19:05.665 --> 19:07.057
Well, I read
somewhere once

19:07.102 --> 19:10.060
that sometimes
they go to movies.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.759
Movies?
Interesting.

19:11.801 --> 19:14.153
And I saw on TV once

19:14.195 --> 19:17.199
a bunch of people our
age went to a party.

19:17.242 --> 19:19.114
Wow, never knew
being a teenager

19:19.157 --> 19:20.855
was so full
of possibilities.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.903
[doorbell rings]

19:26.948 --> 19:28.384
That's Owen.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.865
That's Giles.
We need to talk.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.432
Buffy's not home!

19:33.476 --> 19:34.912
My calculations
may not have been

19:34.955 --> 19:36.566
as far off as I thought.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.655
"Five die in van accident"?

19:39.700 --> 19:42.397
"Out of the ashes of five,
shall rise the one."

19:42.442 --> 19:44.400
That's the prophesy.
Five people have died.

19:44.443 --> 19:46.358
In a car crash.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.882
I know it doesn't
quite follow,

19:47.924 --> 19:49.230
but-but it's worth
investigating, look!

19:49.275 --> 19:50.624
"Among the dead
was Andrew Borba,

19:50.666 --> 19:52.059
whom the police
sought for questioning

19:52.103 --> 19:53.539
in a double murder."

19:53.583 --> 19:54.714
He may be The Anointed One.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.891
Now, the-the bodies
have been taken

19:56.933 --> 19:59.109
to-to Sunnydale Funeral Home.
We can--

19:59.153 --> 20:00.589
Giles, why do you want
to hurt me?

20:00.634 --> 20:02.069
I beg your pardon?

20:02.113 --> 20:03.549
Hey.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.901
Uh, hi.

20:06.943 --> 20:08.510
You have a date.

20:08.555 --> 20:11.210
Yes, but I will return those
overdue books by tomorrow.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.689
No, you're not getting off
that easily.

20:12.732 --> 20:15.083
Man, you really care
about your work.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.564
Uh, Owen?

20:17.606 --> 20:20.087
Yeah, a couple of things
about tonight.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.179
Another date? Don't you
ever do anything else?

20:24.222 --> 20:27.050
This is the first date.
There's never been a date, okay?

20:27.095 --> 20:28.138
This is my maiden voyage.

20:28.182 --> 20:30.271
What, she doesn't like to dance?

20:30.316 --> 20:32.273
Well, it's a little too late
to do anything about that.

20:32.317 --> 20:33.753
Uh, you should probably know

20:33.797 --> 20:35.233
that Buffy doesn't
like to be kissed.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.973
Actually, she doesn't
even like to be touched.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.279
Xander!
As a matter of fact,

20:38.324 --> 20:39.673
don't even look at her.

20:39.715 --> 20:41.152
We don't even know
if this is anything.

20:41.195 --> 20:42.284
Well, no, we don't.And I haven't had

20:42.327 --> 20:43.763
a day off for a while.
True.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.114
And a cranky slayer
is a careless slayer.

20:46.156 --> 20:47.723
Buffy,

20:47.768 --> 20:50.074
maintaining a normal
social life as a slayer

20:50.117 --> 20:52.859
[stammers]
is problematic at best.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.991
This is the '90s--
the 1990s,

20:55.036 --> 20:57.517
in point of fact--
and I can do both.

20:57.559 --> 20:58.996
Clark Kent has a job.

20:59.039 --> 21:00.998
I just want to go on a date.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.696
Well, I suppose it was
a fairly slim lead.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.394
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21:05.438 --> 21:06.829
And, look, I won't far, okay?

21:06.874 --> 21:09.268
If the apocalypse comes,
beep me.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.661
Is everything cool?
All set.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.621
Yes, and you'll face a pretty
hefty fine in the morning.

21:14.663 --> 21:16.578
Well, bye.
Don't wait up.

21:18.058 --> 21:19.669
Is something going on?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.671
Oh, well,
probably not, no.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.717
I, uh, I suppose
I'll just, uh...

21:23.759 --> 21:25.674
go to the funeral
home in case.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.938
Just see if
anything comes up.

21:27.981 --> 21:29.417
This is bad.

21:29.461 --> 21:31.115
I wish it was just bad.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.727
We should go along.

21:33.769 --> 21:35.205
Yeah, you're right.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.686
I don't trust
that Owen guy.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.819
It's the eyes--
they're crazy.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.822
Xander, we should
go with Giles.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.476
He could get in trouble.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.128
Oh, he's gone.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.740
He's gonna be all right.

21:46.782 --> 21:49.133
He's like super librarian,
you know?

21:49.176 --> 21:50.787
Everyone forgets, Willow,

21:50.830 --> 21:54.137
that knowledge
is the ultimate weapon.

21:54.182 --> 21:56.531
[indistinct chatter]

21:59.970 --> 22:04.845
â™ª I'll be right along

22:04.887 --> 22:07.020
â™ª 'Cause, baby, you're so

22:07.064 --> 22:11.547
â™ª Strong...

22:13.288 --> 22:15.071
The thing about
Emily Dickinson I love

22:15.115 --> 22:17.640
is that's she's just
so incredibly morbid.

22:17.683 --> 22:20.250
A lot of loss,
a lot of death.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.123
It gets me.

22:22.165 --> 22:25.125
A lot about bees
for some reason.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.301
Did she have a tragic
and romantic life

22:27.346 --> 22:29.130
with a lot of bees?

22:29.173 --> 22:32.046
Quiet, kind of
sequestered and uneventful,

22:32.088 --> 22:34.265
which I can really relate to.

22:34.308 --> 22:35.875
I don't get out much.

22:35.919 --> 22:38.400
I don't get that.

22:38.443 --> 22:39.836
It's my fault.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.924
I just find most girls
pretty frivolous.

22:41.969 --> 22:44.405
I mean, there's a lot more
important things in life

22:44.450 --> 22:47.234
than dating,
you know?

22:47.278 --> 22:49.585
Oh.

22:49.628 --> 22:50.804
Did I say something wrong?

22:50.846 --> 22:52.935
Uh, no.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.286
Come on.

22:58.115 --> 23:02.945
â™ª Baby, baby, I know

23:02.990 --> 23:04.644
â™ª It's always been so

23:04.686 --> 23:10.213
â™ª Physical love is

23:10.258 --> 23:11.693
â™ª Oh so meaningful

23:11.738 --> 23:16.351
â™ª For you...

23:16.394 --> 23:18.221
It's weird.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.833
What is?

23:19.875 --> 23:21.574
You.

23:21.616 --> 23:23.444
One minute,
you're right there.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.924
I got you figured.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.622
The next--

23:26.665 --> 23:28.971
it's like
you're two people.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.234
Really?

23:31.278 --> 23:33.628
Which one do
you like better?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.413
I'll let you know.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.765
â™ª So strong

23:38.807 --> 23:41.244
â™ª Baby

23:41.288 --> 23:44.770
â™ª I'm lost

23:44.814 --> 23:46.468
â™ª You know

23:46.511 --> 23:51.255
â™ª Because you're so strong

23:51.298 --> 23:54.040
CORDELIA:
Aren't there laws against

23:54.084 --> 23:56.086
this sort of thing?

23:56.957 --> 23:58.959
Owen?

24:00.481 --> 24:02.309
Look at you here,
all alone.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.746
Cordelia,
I'm here with Buffy.

24:03.789 --> 24:05.704
Oh, okay.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
You want to dance?

24:07.532 --> 24:09.751
No. I'm still here with Buffy.

24:09.796 --> 24:12.451
You are so good
to help the needy.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.496
Cordelia, Owen and I would
like to be alone right now,

24:14.539 --> 24:16.628
and for that to happen,
you would have

24:16.672 --> 24:18.500
to go somewhere that's away.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.328
Well, when you're ready
for the big leagues,

24:21.372 --> 24:23.461
let me know.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.464
â™ª You would suffer, suffer

24:26.508 --> 24:29.292
â™ª For me...

24:46.701 --> 24:49.356
â™ª

25:10.682 --> 25:14.337
[growling]

25:17.298 --> 25:19.343
Damn.

25:24.173 --> 25:26.175
[vampires growling]

25:27.742 --> 25:30.180
[hissing]

25:36.535 --> 25:40.103
â™ª

25:46.108 --> 25:48.111
[growling]

25:50.940 --> 25:55.162
â™ª I have a window
in my mind â™ª

25:57.424 --> 26:00.863
â™ª I can tell it to look
right through you â™ª

26:00.906 --> 26:03.170
Are you, uh, having fun?

26:03.212 --> 26:04.650
Yeah.

26:04.692 --> 26:06.955
I almost feel like a girl.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.436
â™ª

26:34.288 --> 26:36.637
Let's see...

26:42.730 --> 26:45.342
[gasps]

26:45.385 --> 26:47.126
Giles, it's us.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.432
What are you doing here?

26:48.476 --> 26:49.912
We saw two guys go in after you.

26:49.955 --> 26:51.305
Are they--?They are.

26:51.347 --> 26:53.523
Listen, you should
get to safety.

26:53.567 --> 26:55.308
Can you get out
this window?

26:55.352 --> 26:57.876
I'm afraid not.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.661
Look, I hate to state
the obvious,

26:59.704 --> 27:01.489
but this looks
like a job for Buffy.

27:01.531 --> 27:05.144
Uh, she has a-a-a beeping thing.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.711
Uh, no phone, of course.

27:06.755 --> 27:09.627
Look, we'll get her.
Just, uh, hang in there.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.542
[crashing]

27:12.586 --> 27:14.720
Do hurry.

27:14.762 --> 27:17.200
[rock music playing]

27:19.420 --> 27:21.422
Do you want
something to eat?

27:21.464 --> 27:24.163
Sure, just make it
something fattening.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.688
What a disgusting display.

27:26.731 --> 27:29.125
Is that really
appropriate behavior

27:29.169 --> 27:31.300
in a public forum?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.346
I mean, I've
never seen a girl

27:33.390 --> 27:34.869
throw herself
at a guy like that.

27:34.913 --> 27:37.176
[groans]

27:37.220 --> 27:39.092
Ooh...

27:39.134 --> 27:42.355
Hello, salty goodness.

27:42.398 --> 27:43.704
Pick up the phone.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.054
Call 911.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.186
That boy is gonna
need some serious

27:47.230 --> 27:49.144
oxygen after I'm
through with him.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.673
Buffy.

27:54.715 --> 27:55.847
Angel.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.720
Why is this happening to me?

27:58.763 --> 28:00.940
I was hoping I'd find you here.

28:00.982 --> 28:03.202
You were?Some serious stuff
happening tonight.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.943
You need to be out there.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.684
No, not you, too.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.121
What do you know?

28:08.163 --> 28:11.166
Prophecy, Anointed One,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.342
So you know, fine.

28:12.385 --> 28:14.126
I just thought I'd warn you.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.998
Warn me?

28:16.041 --> 28:17.826
You see that guy
over there at the bar?

28:17.869 --> 28:19.393
He came here
to be with me.

28:19.435 --> 28:20.960
You're here on a date?

28:21.002 --> 28:24.833
Yes! Why is it such
a shock to everyone?

28:24.876 --> 28:26.835
Here you go.

28:26.878 --> 28:29.750
Uh...

28:29.795 --> 28:32.101
um, Owen,

28:32.144 --> 28:33.798
this is Angel.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.452
Angel, this is Owen,

28:36.497 --> 28:37.890
who is my date.

28:37.932 --> 28:39.718
Hey.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.154
Hey.

28:42.198 --> 28:45.157
So, where do you
know Buffy from?

28:45.201 --> 28:46.811
Work.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.814
Do you work?
WILLOW:
Buffy!

28:48.856 --> 28:50.423
OWEN:
Look at this.

28:50.467 --> 28:53.339
You show up everywhere,
interesting.

28:53.383 --> 28:54.819
You don't know the half of it.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.430
What's he doing here?

28:56.472 --> 28:58.519
My guess is the same thing
you're doing here.

28:58.561 --> 29:00.913
Uh, excuse me,
what are any of you doing here?

29:00.955 --> 29:03.306
Look, we got to get to, uh--
[groans]

29:03.349 --> 29:05.917
We thought it'd be fun if, uh,
we made this a double date.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.747
I didn't know you guys
were seeing each other.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.227
Oh, yeah, well, we knew it
would happen eventually,

29:11.270 --> 29:13.882
so we figured, hey,
why fight it?

29:13.925 --> 29:15.753
And you guys were
thinking double?

29:15.797 --> 29:17.493
'Cause of...
[chuckles]

29:17.538 --> 29:18.844
the fun!

29:18.886 --> 29:23.152
And you're here
because of work?

29:23.195 --> 29:24.980
Hey, maybe we should all
go somewhere together.

29:25.023 --> 29:27.068
Gee, that's so nice
of you to ask,

29:27.113 --> 29:29.115
but Owen and I were,
well, sort of Owen and I.

29:29.157 --> 29:30.769
You know what'd be cool?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.770
The Sunnydale Funeral Home.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.163
I've always
wanted to go there.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.339
The funeral home.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.689
Actually, that sounds
kind of cool.

29:38.732 --> 29:39.778
Do you think we could
all sneak in?

29:39.820 --> 29:41.300
We saw some guys
in there before.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.606
They seemed to be having fun.

29:43.651 --> 29:46.567
Bite me!

29:47.915 --> 29:50.048
[sighs]
Um,

29:50.092 --> 29:51.963
Owen, I got to go.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.791
I thought we were going
to the funeral home?

29:53.835 --> 29:55.531
No, you can't!

29:55.576 --> 29:58.057
I'll tell you what--
I'll be back in a little while.

29:58.099 --> 29:59.231
Buffy.

30:01.973 --> 30:03.497
What's the deal?
Do you want to bail on me?

30:03.539 --> 30:06.586
No! No, no. Uh...

30:06.630 --> 30:10.068
Do you remember when you said I
was like two different people?

30:10.112 --> 30:13.201
Well, one of them has to go,
but the other one is having

30:13.246 --> 30:16.030
a really, really good time
and will come back.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.817
I promise.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.863
â™ª I'm in love

30:21.906 --> 30:24.865
â™ª With a junkie girl

30:24.910 --> 30:27.826
â™ª And the junkie girl

30:27.868 --> 30:30.262
â™ª She's in love with me

30:30.306 --> 30:33.353
She's the strangest girl.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.362
Which way?

30:42.404 --> 30:44.406
The room's around back.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.546
Damn it!

30:52.588 --> 30:53.852
This is so cool.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.636
Owen?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.029
You can't be here.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.682
Oh, and I suppose
you guys are allowed?

30:59.727 --> 31:01.816
What are we doing here?
Are we gonna see a dead body?

31:01.859 --> 31:03.383
Possibly several.

31:03.425 --> 31:05.037
Guys, watch him.

31:05.079 --> 31:07.212
Is she mad?

31:07.256 --> 31:09.563
Oh, she just wants to make
sure there are no guards,

31:09.605 --> 31:11.565
so we don't get in trouble.

31:11.607 --> 31:12.695
Good thinking.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.523
Good thinking.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.544
Giles?

31:50.169 --> 31:51.822
Giles!

31:51.865 --> 31:53.650
It is you.
Oh, good.

31:53.693 --> 31:55.347
What happened?

31:55.391 --> 31:57.088
Uh, two more of the brethren
came in here.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.916
They came after me.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.830
But I was more
than a match for them.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.920
Meaning?

32:01.962 --> 32:03.269
I hid.

32:03.311 --> 32:04.965
But this chap
was good enough

32:05.009 --> 32:07.882
to bunk with me
until they went away.

32:07.925 --> 32:10.753
Well, were they here after you,
or was it that prophecy thing?

32:10.798 --> 32:12.973
Uh, that's what we
have to find out.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.410
I don't know

32:14.453 --> 32:16.194
what these brethren
mean to do exactly...

32:16.238 --> 32:19.762
Find The Anointed or, or,
or give him something perhaps?

32:19.807 --> 32:21.242
Uh, it's all very vague.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.028
And The Anointed
may be long gone.

32:23.070 --> 32:24.420
But he may not be.

32:24.463 --> 32:26.727
We must find out.
Okay.

32:26.769 --> 32:29.121
I just need to get Owen and the
others out of harm's way first.

32:29.163 --> 32:31.165
Owen?
You brought a date?

32:31.210 --> 32:34.082
I didn't bring him.
He came.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.865
Buffy, when I said
you could slay vampires

32:35.910 --> 32:37.867
and have a social life,
I didn't mean at the same time.

32:37.912 --> 32:39.434
I know,
I'll get rid of him.

32:39.479 --> 32:41.046
You can't make him
go out there alone.

32:41.088 --> 32:43.003
We don't know
where the brethren are.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.919
I'll just--No! No, Giles.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.789
If he sees you,
he's gonna have more questions

32:46.834 --> 32:48.878
than he already does right now.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.056
I'll take care of it.

32:53.492 --> 32:55.016
Is everything okay?

32:55.059 --> 32:56.538
It is.

32:56.583 --> 32:57.976
And we'll be leaving?

32:58.019 --> 32:59.280
We're not done
looking around yet.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.542
No, he's right.

33:00.586 --> 33:02.588
So let's find
a nice safe, fun room

33:02.632 --> 33:04.982
to look around in.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.549
We tried the office here,
but it's locked.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.029
[grunts]

33:09.074 --> 33:11.510
No, it's not.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.255
Well, I don't think
we'll find much in here.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.560
That's the plan.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.780
Okay.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.826
What?

33:22.869 --> 33:24.480
I have to go now.

33:24.523 --> 33:26.700
Um, to the bathroom.
I have to go to the bathroom.

33:26.742 --> 33:28.875
If you hear anything, like a
security guard or something,

33:28.919 --> 33:31.356
just be really quiet...

33:31.400 --> 33:33.097
and barricade the door.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.290
[groans]
Parts.

33:52.334 --> 33:53.640
GILES:
Keep looking.

33:53.682 --> 33:55.684
He must be here somewhere.

34:03.692 --> 34:05.173
What are you guys doing?

34:05.217 --> 34:07.219
Un, just in case.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.755
Oh, my.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.246
[grunts]

34:36.030 --> 34:37.335
Nothing.

34:37.378 --> 34:39.119
The Anointed
must be gone.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.688
I guess.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.907
I mean, this is where they keep
all the dead bodies, right?

34:44.952 --> 34:47.128
Uh-huh.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.608
I read a lot about death,

34:49.652 --> 34:54.135
but I've never really
seen a dead body before.

34:56.181 --> 34:59.967
Do they... usually move?

35:17.463 --> 35:20.769
I have been judged.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.737
What's... going on?

35:38.396 --> 35:41.050
Oh, no.

35:41.094 --> 35:43.706
[laughs]
He is risen in me.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.056
He fills my head with song.

35:46.099 --> 35:48.929
Pork and beans.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.148
Pork and beans.Give me that.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.193
I can smell you.

35:54.847 --> 35:56.371
You're the chaff, unblessed.

35:56.414 --> 35:58.547
I'll suck the blood
from your hearts.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.722
He says I may.

36:02.246 --> 36:03.465
He's in there.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.163
Uh, go!
Get out!

36:05.206 --> 36:06.512
XANDER:
She'll be okay, come on.

36:06.554 --> 36:08.818
BORBA:
â™ª Shall we gather

36:08.862 --> 36:10.210
â™ª At the river

36:10.255 --> 36:13.213
â™ª The beautiful
the beautiful river â™ª

36:13.257 --> 36:15.347
[shrieks][growling]

36:18.653 --> 36:21.179
[Borba continues singing
indistinctly]

36:21.222 --> 36:23.746
I think he's coming this way.

36:29.273 --> 36:32.146
Oh, God!
This is too much!

36:32.190 --> 36:34.626
What have you got?
What?

36:34.670 --> 36:36.193
What did you bring?
Do you have a stake?

36:36.237 --> 36:37.672
Oh, um--
Thank you.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.197
W-What should I do?

36:39.239 --> 36:41.851
Um, go outside and make sure
the others are okay.

36:41.894 --> 36:44.418
[screams]

36:44.463 --> 36:46.378
Buffy!

36:46.420 --> 36:48.771
Somebody's got to help Buffy!

36:48.815 --> 36:51.556
Owen!

36:51.599 --> 36:54.690
They told me about you
while I was sleeping.

36:54.733 --> 36:57.302
[groans]
Why does he hurt me?

36:59.391 --> 37:01.567
[shouting]

37:01.610 --> 37:03.177
[buzzing]

37:05.918 --> 37:07.572
Buffy!

37:07.615 --> 37:08.748
[grunting]

37:08.791 --> 37:09.748
No!
No!

37:09.791 --> 37:11.271
[both grunt]

37:16.494 --> 37:17.757
[growls]

37:19.018 --> 37:20.237
[grunts]

37:23.501 --> 37:26.331
Did you see that?

37:26.373 --> 37:29.246
He tried to bite me.
What a sissy.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.423
No!

37:32.467 --> 37:33.686
Dead.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.865
He was found wanting.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.346
[both grunt]

37:56.403 --> 37:58.231
You killed my date!

37:58.275 --> 38:00.016
[Buffy grunting]

38:00.059 --> 38:02.670
[punches landing]

38:08.286 --> 38:10.505
Buffy, Owen's--Just give her a sec.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.420
[grunting]

38:12.463 --> 38:14.030
You killed my date!

38:14.074 --> 38:15.380
[groans]

38:17.338 --> 38:19.340
Your turn.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.036
[shouts]

38:21.081 --> 38:23.561
[screaming]

38:31.744 --> 38:34.659
Does anyone
have an aspirin?

38:34.702 --> 38:36.313
Or 60?

38:37.576 --> 38:38.967
BUFFY:
Owen.

38:39.012 --> 38:42.710
What happened
to that guy?

38:42.755 --> 38:45.974
Oh. We scared him away.

38:46.018 --> 38:47.672
Oh, good, 'cause,
you know, I would've--

38:47.715 --> 38:49.108
I know.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.762
Here.

38:55.027 --> 38:58.074
I'm sure this isn't exactly
what you had in mind

38:58.117 --> 38:59.945
for a first date.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.382
Yeah... I was hoping maybe

39:02.427 --> 39:05.081
we'd finish up
at Ben and Jerry's.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.300
We still could.

39:07.344 --> 39:10.565
No, I-I think
I'll just walk home.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.179
Uh... which way's home?

39:17.224 --> 39:19.574
I'll get you there.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.923
No, I'll-I'll go it alone.

39:21.967 --> 39:25.318
I'll make sure he
gets home safely.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.197
Buffy, if I might, uh--Don't.

39:40.159 --> 39:44.119
Well, did Owen say anything
about me on the way home?

39:44.164 --> 39:46.427
Well, you mean
specifically about you?

39:46.471 --> 39:48.472
Or generally...
in the area...

39:48.516 --> 39:50.909
in the ballpark--
any sort of indication?

39:50.952 --> 39:52.954
Well, in that case, no.

39:52.998 --> 39:55.436
But he was pretty incoherent,
so we might've missed it.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.742
You think?

39:56.784 --> 39:58.483
No.

39:58.525 --> 40:01.094
Anyway, I totally
blew it last night.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.269
No, see, what you need
is a guy who already knows

40:03.313 --> 40:04.923
your deepest, darkest secrets
and still says,

40:04.967 --> 40:07.360
"Hey, I like that girl."
Someone like--

40:07.405 --> 40:08.884
Owen.
Huh?

40:10.364 --> 40:12.018
Well.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.237
[chuckles]
This is our stop.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.936
Hi.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.460
Hi.

40:20.505 --> 40:23.637
â™ª All around you...

40:23.681 --> 40:26.684
This is going well.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.731
I don't really know
how to say this,

40:29.775 --> 40:31.907
but about last night--

40:31.951 --> 40:33.387
You don't even have to.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.909
I'm sure you were
pretty freaked out.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.128
Totally.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.347
And I was wondering

40:38.391 --> 40:40.175
when I could see you again.

40:41.829 --> 40:44.311
Um, that was my hopeful ear.

40:44.353 --> 40:46.181
Could you repeat that?

40:46.226 --> 40:49.010
I think you're the coolest.

40:49.054 --> 40:50.230
Really?

40:50.273 --> 40:52.536
I mean, last night
was incredible.

40:52.579 --> 40:54.016
I never thought that
nearly getting killed

40:54.059 --> 40:56.061
would make me feel so alive.

40:56.105 --> 40:59.021
So that's why you
want to be with me.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.849
Oh, absolutely.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.981
When can we do something
like that again?

41:03.025 --> 41:04.853
Something like...?

41:04.896 --> 41:07.115
Like walk downtown
at 3:00 in the morning

41:07.159 --> 41:09.030
and-and pick a
fight in a bar.

41:09.074 --> 41:10.554
How about tonight?

41:10.597 --> 41:12.947
Tonight would... be...

41:12.992 --> 41:14.733
not a workable thing.

41:14.775 --> 41:16.255
Did I just say that?

41:16.298 --> 41:18.737
Tomorrow, then.
I-I'm free any night this week.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.260
I'm not.

41:21.304 --> 41:22.740
Please don't take
this personally.

41:22.784 --> 41:25.570
It's not you.
It's me.

41:25.612 --> 41:26.918
Right.

41:26.961 --> 41:28.528
It's you.

41:28.572 --> 41:31.923
And I was kind of hoping
that maybe you and I

41:31.967 --> 41:33.925
could still be--I-I get it.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.972
You just want to be friends.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.974
That'd be nice.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.454
Friends.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.586
Yeah.

41:43.717 --> 41:45.503
Great.

41:45.545 --> 41:49.289
â™ª The world will
keep on turning â™ª

41:49.331 --> 41:52.552
â™ª It'll all be there
come morning... â™ª

41:52.597 --> 41:53.989
Yeah.

41:54.032 --> 41:55.903
Great.

41:55.947 --> 42:01.431
â™ª So tonight...

42:01.474 --> 42:03.998
Um...

42:04.043 --> 42:06.480
â™ª Let the sun fall down...

42:06.523 --> 42:10.092
I was ten years old
when my father told me

42:10.135 --> 42:12.572
I was destined
to be a watcher.

42:12.617 --> 42:14.532
He was one and his, uh,

42:14.574 --> 42:17.838
mother before him,
and I was to be next.

42:17.882 --> 42:19.666
Were you thrilled
beyond all measure?

42:19.710 --> 42:21.407
No. I had very definite
plans about my future.

42:21.451 --> 42:24.193
I was gonna be a fighter pilot.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.021
Or possibly a grocer...

42:26.065 --> 42:29.329
Uh, my father gave me
a very tiresome speech

42:29.371 --> 42:31.331
about, uh, responsibility

42:31.373 --> 42:33.681
and sacrifice.

42:33.724 --> 42:35.943
"Sacrifice," huh?

42:35.987 --> 42:39.556
He seems like
a nice lad.

42:39.599 --> 42:42.168
Yeah.

42:42.210 --> 42:44.735
But he wants
to be Dangerman.

42:44.778 --> 42:46.650
Hmm.

42:46.693 --> 42:49.523
You, Xander, Willow,
you guys--

42:49.567 --> 42:52.481
you guys know the score.
You're careful.

42:52.525 --> 42:55.572
Two days in my world, and Owen
really would get himself killed.

42:55.615 --> 42:57.878
Or I'd get him killed.

43:00.315 --> 43:02.143
Or someone else.

43:02.188 --> 43:06.148
No, I went to the funeral home
of my own free will.

43:06.192 --> 43:07.496
And I should've been there.

43:07.541 --> 43:08.802
Buffy--
I blew it!

43:08.847 --> 43:10.021
I have volumes

43:10.065 --> 43:11.762
of lore, of prophecies,

43:11.806 --> 43:14.068
of predictions,

43:14.112 --> 43:16.898
but I don't have
an instruction manual.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.858
We feel our way as we go along.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.556
And, I must say, as a slayer,

43:22.599 --> 43:24.601
you're-you're doing...

43:24.644 --> 43:26.211
pretty well.

43:28.213 --> 43:31.782
Well, at least I did stop that
prophecy thing from coming true.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.697
You did.

43:33.740 --> 43:35.003
Handily.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.918
No more Anointed One.

43:36.961 --> 43:39.833
And I would imagine The Master,
wherever he is,

43:39.878 --> 43:42.793
is having a fairly
bad day himself.

43:44.664 --> 43:48.103
"And in this time will come

43:48.146 --> 43:49.844
"The Anointed,

43:49.887 --> 43:53.673
"and The Slayer
will not know him.

43:53.717 --> 43:57.373
"She will not stop him.

43:57.416 --> 44:01.900
And he will lead her into Hell."

44:05.686 --> 44:08.994
Welcome, my friend.

44:09.036 --> 44:10.996
[chuckling]

44:50.818 --> 44:53.342
Grr. Argh.
