WEBVTT

01:26.570 --> 01:30.282
Sir, we've been skirting Mexican
airspace for the last 10 minutes.

01:30.282 --> 01:34.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42.294 --> 01:43.837
-Hey.
-Yeah?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.923
Ever show you my cabin?

01:45.923 --> 01:49.923
From about 10 feet away
every time we're down here.

02:02.105 --> 02:04.524
Give me the rate points,
you big baby.

02:04.524 --> 02:08.070
Two-four-three degrees,
one minute, 900 miles--

02:08.070 --> 02:12.070
Never mind, never mind. I see it.

02:31.635 --> 02:34.388
Spare me. I had a machaca burrito
for breakfast.

02:34.388 --> 02:38.225
Relax. Relax.
It's my last flight, man, relax.

02:38.225 --> 02:42.225
Yours, not mine.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.866
I'd prefer a little altitude, sir.

02:54.866 --> 02:56.410
-Altitude?
-Altitude.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.329
You want some altitude?

02:59.329 --> 03:01.206
Altitude !

03:01.206 --> 03:05.206
Okay.

03:06.503 --> 03:10.503
Motherfucker!

03:21.685 --> 03:25.685
You're really sick, you know that?

03:29.109 --> 03:33.109
Let's see the presents.

03:39.911 --> 03:43.790
All right, all right, all right.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.584
All right, all right, guys.

03:45.584 --> 03:49.584
This is from the girls
at the Afterburner.

03:50.922 --> 03:53.383
And they promised me--

03:53.383 --> 03:57.383
There's a picture
of what they promised.

03:57.804 --> 04:01.804
Fred.

04:05.771 --> 04:09.771
Look at that.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.110
This is from Tiburon Mendez.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.904
-Who?
-Who?

04:13.904 --> 04:17.904
He supplied the champagne,
assholes.

04:23.538 --> 04:25.040
They are tennis buddies...

04:25.040 --> 04:29.040
... so if an offer for a friendly game
comes up, hide your wallets.

04:31.463 --> 04:33.882
And this--

04:33.882 --> 04:36.468
This is from all of us.

04:36.468 --> 04:40.468
Because we knew you'd be
too cheap to buy one for yourself.

04:40.722 --> 04:44.722
-Yeah.
-That's right.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.410
Well, shit.
Now I guess I'm supposed to--

05:02.410 --> 05:04.746
What? Tell everybody
what I think about them?

05:04.746 --> 05:08.746
Yeah !

05:11.878 --> 05:15.878
You're the best.

05:17.551 --> 05:21.551
It's been an honor to serve with you.

05:24.057 --> 05:28.057
And to my surprise...

05:28.562 --> 05:32.562
...to my deep surprise,
it's harder to say goodbye...

05:32.649 --> 05:36.649
...than I thought.

05:51.001 --> 05:52.586
Pricks, one and all.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.586
Yeah !

05:58.425 --> 06:00.719
So any idea
of when you're coming back?

06:00.719 --> 06:04.264
Nope.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.141
Hey, nothing's forever, man.

06:06.141 --> 06:10.141
No, I don't guess it is.

06:14.441 --> 06:18.441
Except maybe friendship.

06:18.862 --> 06:21.990
-Watch your step down there.
-Yeah, try not to wreck my place.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.117
Hey, you know me.

06:24.117 --> 06:28.117
Try not to wreck my place.

06:29.372 --> 06:31.541
Madero.

06:31.541 --> 06:35.541
I'll be thinking of you.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.667
-Hi.
-Hello.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.420
I'm a little lost.
I was wondering if....

07:17.420 --> 07:19.381
Is everything all right?

07:19.381 --> 07:22.676
Yes, he just threw a shoe.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.511
Well, maybe you can help me.

07:24.511 --> 07:27.889
I'm trying to find the Mendez place.

07:27.889 --> 07:31.889
-Mr. Cochran?
-Yes.

07:32.394 --> 07:36.394
-Mrs... ?
-Mendez. Yes.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.150
I must be warm.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.529
You are.
It's the first gate on the left.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.529
Thank you.

08:09.723 --> 08:13.723
Small, yeah? But nice.

08:22.819 --> 08:25.322
Good afternoon, Mr. Cochran.

08:25.322 --> 08:27.490
You were expected two days ago.

08:27.490 --> 08:30.285
I'm on vacation. I took my time.

08:30.285 --> 08:32.787
-Your bags?
-They're in the jeep.

08:32.787 --> 08:36.374
Roberto.

08:36.374 --> 08:38.083
No, no, no.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.669
I'm taking a place at the beach,
thank you.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.714
We have prepared
a room for you here.

08:42.714 --> 08:45.050
I like it at the beach.

08:45.050 --> 08:47.427
Who are you?

08:47.427 --> 08:50.889
Roberto, gracias.

08:50.889 --> 08:54.889
I am Cesar.

08:59.147 --> 09:02.942
Kind of a dog-shit shot.

09:02.942 --> 09:06.942
Who are we gonna beat
playing like that?

09:07.781 --> 09:11.781
Cochran. You see what I'm
reduced to? Come on, hey.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.456
Imagine what this has done
to my timing.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.458
Don't. Just don't.

09:18.458 --> 09:22.458
-What?
-Don't sandbag me. All right?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.134
Now me, I'm playing
with a new racket.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.261
All right? So I'll play you even.

09:30.261 --> 09:33.556
-I want the first point each game.
-No.

09:33.556 --> 09:35.725
Come on, I'm old enough
to be your father.

09:35.725 --> 09:39.725
I ain't giving you shit. I said
I'd play you even, I play you even.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.483
Damn it, it's good to see you.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.236
I wait around
like a stupid schoolboy.

09:46.236 --> 09:48.655
-Where've you been?
-I stopped off at the cabin.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.615
I wanted to work Rocky a little bit.

09:50.615 --> 09:53.368
Make sure the locals hadn't
carted the place away.

09:53.368 --> 09:57.368
I missed you. I worried about you.
You should humor me.

09:58.039 --> 10:01.042
I do.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.670
What does that mean?

10:03.670 --> 10:06.923
It means I haven't forgotten
whose court I'm on.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.717
And don't forget it.

10:09.717 --> 10:12.053
All right,
we're gonna warm up, huh?

10:12.053 --> 10:14.681
No, no warm up.

10:14.681 --> 10:18.393
-Let's just play.
-How many games you spotting me?

10:18.393 --> 10:22.393
As many as you want.

10:28.153 --> 10:32.153
I learned this from my wife.

10:32.615 --> 10:36.615
The caviar. Not the manners.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.871
I brought you something.

10:42.876 --> 10:46.876
-For me?
-For you.

10:53.553 --> 10:57.553
Oh, it's beautiful.

11:01.019 --> 11:03.897
I love it.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.983
I want my wife to see it.

11:06.983 --> 11:09.152
Oh, she has been told
already, senor.

11:09.152 --> 11:11.613
Does she know we're eating?

11:11.613 --> 11:15.613
Tell her we're waiting.

11:18.453 --> 11:20.747
She's a wonderful girl.

11:20.747 --> 11:24.375
Sometimes I think
I should have married the mother.

11:24.375 --> 11:28.375
Much more sensible.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.717
I suppose I owe you, huh?

11:32.717 --> 11:35.887
No, no, no.
Now we're even.

11:35.887 --> 11:39.098
-What do you mean?
-The guns. We're even.

11:39.098 --> 11:43.098
-You liked the guns?
-Very much.

11:43.228 --> 11:45.188
This is a good start for us.

11:45.188 --> 11:48.107
Sometime this year
we'll take those guns to Italy...

11:48.107 --> 11:51.277
... and have them fitted properly.

11:51.277 --> 11:55.114
Oh, shit. All right.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.951
You know, maybe it's better
you're not staying here.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.828
This damned election
has everything upside down.

12:00.828 --> 12:04.828
-You sure?
-Yeah, but we'll find time for fun.

12:05.416 --> 12:09.416
You know, I was thinking about
a hunting trip in the morning.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.631
-What?
-What do you think?

12:11.631 --> 12:15.631
Shit, man.
That's why I came down here.

12:23.226 --> 12:25.436
Here.

12:25.436 --> 12:28.898
-Good afternoon. What happened?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.276
-I got lost.
-Well, didn't you get a map?

12:31.276 --> 12:35.238
I got what you gave me but I can't
follow the instructions. You make this?

12:35.238 --> 12:39.238
Rocky can't read them, so--

12:41.452 --> 12:45.452
-I'm kidding.
-Oh, he's only kidding.

12:46.624 --> 12:50.624
Hey, it's a bitch of a morning.
You want some hot coffee, huh?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.016
Senor Mendez?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.184
-Telephone.
-Who is it?

13:05.184 --> 13:07.604
-Senor Quinones.
-Oh, fuck him.

13:07.604 --> 13:11.482
Tell him I'll call back later.

13:11.482 --> 13:13.026
Oh, son of a bitch.

13:13.026 --> 13:17.026
I have a politician
who's unable to make a decision.

13:18.531 --> 13:22.531
-Come on. You're gonna catch cold.
-No, I'm fine.

13:25.455 --> 13:28.458
Only whores smoke in public.

13:28.458 --> 13:32.458
Oh, Jay, this is Miryea, my wife.

13:33.588 --> 13:36.049
This is Jay Cochran.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.800
My friend.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.095
Tibey's told me a lot about you.

13:41.095 --> 13:43.765
You probably should hear
my side of the story.

13:43.765 --> 13:47.765
Hi.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.569
What the hell's so funny?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.905
Twenty thousand dollars American.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.905
So much for pedigrees, huh?

14:05.411 --> 14:07.497
I'm sorry, Jay, I-- I have to go.

14:07.497 --> 14:09.582
We're not having dinner tonight?

14:09.582 --> 14:13.086
Oh, of course we are.
Jay, you're gonna join us?

14:13.086 --> 14:16.172
-I don't have to.
-Oh, come on, I want you there.

14:16.172 --> 14:19.092
Please, Mr. Cochran.
Tibey's political friends are boring.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.594
She's right.
But the dinner will be short.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.594
And if you don't like anyone,
you just give me the sign and... out.

14:26.974 --> 14:30.974
No, no. K. C., Kansas City, Missouri.
There's also Kansas City, Kansas.

14:32.897 --> 14:34.649
We're from Missouri originally.

14:34.649 --> 14:36.401
But we were working Las Vegas...

14:36.401 --> 14:38.903
... and that's where we met
Porfirio and Cisco.

14:38.903 --> 14:42.903
And you know what?
They offered us a job.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.118
You know Cozumel?

14:45.118 --> 14:47.412
I have a place there, me and Diaz.

14:47.412 --> 14:50.915
You want marlin?
A fucking boatload of marlin.

14:50.915 --> 14:54.419
Excuse me. Understand we come from
the same streets as your husband.

14:54.419 --> 14:56.295
Or hunting. You prefer hunting?

14:56.295 --> 14:58.548
-I have a place in--
-In Mérida.

14:58.548 --> 15:00.550
Mérida. Anything you want.

15:00.550 --> 15:02.760
Hundred ducks, hundred quail.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.723
Anything. Both of you.

15:06.723 --> 15:10.723
I won't shoot a hundred anything.

15:11.102 --> 15:12.645
Oh, that's funny.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.565
Because I thought that you
were from Vietnam.

15:15.565 --> 15:17.400
What happened?
You see no action?

15:17.400 --> 15:21.400
Mr. Cochran is a pilot.
He's known all over the world.

15:24.323 --> 15:28.077
You know, the biggest thing
that I ever killed...

15:28.077 --> 15:29.495
...was a jaguar.

15:29.495 --> 15:33.495
He stood 9 feet tall,
including the tail.

15:33.624 --> 15:35.668
You know what I used?

15:35.668 --> 15:39.668
Your car.

15:47.972 --> 15:49.932
That's right.

15:49.932 --> 15:53.932
He was sitting in the roadway.

15:54.228 --> 15:56.063
-Will you please excuse us?
-Yes.

15:56.063 --> 16:00.063
We're gonna discuss
some business.

16:04.614 --> 16:08.534
Ibarra.

16:08.534 --> 16:12.534
Yeah.

16:30.473 --> 16:34.473
-Excuse me.
-Maybe.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.233
Mr. Cochran.

16:40.233 --> 16:44.233
I'm sure Tibey
would want you to stay.

16:54.455 --> 16:57.750
Patrón, it has not been easy.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.420
I have worked very hard
with these people.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.589
We are very close.

17:04.589 --> 17:08.176
But there is a problem.

17:08.176 --> 17:10.179
What is that?

17:10.179 --> 17:12.265
Well, things are not
what they used to be.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.643
For instance, 200 million pesos
is not what it used to be.

17:15.643 --> 17:19.643
And these people in the union
are smarter than what they used to be.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.693
And there's more of them.
And these people...

17:23.693 --> 17:27.693
... do not respect the name
of Tiburon Mendez.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.284
For them,
it's only a matter of money.

17:31.284 --> 17:35.284
So they took your offer
as an insult.

17:37.707 --> 17:39.458
One more thing.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.045
The American,
though he is your friend...

17:43.045 --> 17:47.008
... he insulted us twice.

17:47.008 --> 17:50.469
That is a separate matter.

17:50.469 --> 17:54.469
Well, how did you meet Tibey?
How did that happen?

17:56.100 --> 17:59.729
Well, I've known Tibey
for as long as I can remember.

17:59.729 --> 18:03.524
He and my father
were in business together.

18:03.524 --> 18:07.524
Tibey rescued him from bankruptcy
and they became close friends.

18:12.158 --> 18:16.158
That's how marriages are arranged
down here.

18:22.627 --> 18:24.879
Did I just blow your mind?

18:24.879 --> 18:28.382
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:28.382 --> 18:32.382
-It's not polite to mimic people.
-Oh, I know.

18:33.095 --> 18:35.222
Well, that's not how it was.

18:35.222 --> 18:39.222
I married Tibey
because I was in love with him.

18:40.227 --> 18:44.227
All my sisters
were in love with him.

18:50.237 --> 18:53.032
Well, it's getting late.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.160
Would you tell Tibey
that I was tired?

18:56.160 --> 19:00.160
Yes.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.041
-Thank you for dinner.
-You're welcome.

19:18.307 --> 19:21.394
You are stupid.

19:21.394 --> 19:25.064
But you are more stupid.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.441
While you try to steal my money...

19:27.441 --> 19:31.441
...the union accepts an offer
from Mendoza.

19:31.487 --> 19:33.823
Tomorrow...

19:33.823 --> 19:37.326
...there will be an announcement.

19:37.326 --> 19:41.326
It will be an announcement
of support for Mendoza.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.460
You make a long speech...

19:46.460 --> 19:50.460
... about how things have changed.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.593
You think to lecture me...

19:54.593 --> 19:58.593
... in my own house.

20:00.850 --> 20:04.850
You insult my guest.

20:06.856 --> 20:10.856
Maybe you think you're me.

20:12.486 --> 20:15.281
Let's ask stupid.

20:15.281 --> 20:19.281
Do you think he's me?

20:31.047 --> 20:34.800
Patrón, if I have offended you--

20:34.800 --> 20:38.800
No, no. Both of you.
But your mistake means nothing.

20:39.138 --> 20:43.138
I can always buy support.

20:45.227 --> 20:47.938
But you have no manners.

20:47.938 --> 20:50.524
It is to you and you...

20:50.524 --> 20:54.524
...that my name means nothing.

21:12.421 --> 21:15.049
You are very smart...

21:15.049 --> 21:18.427
... but not ready to be me.

21:18.427 --> 21:22.427
You want to work for me?

21:47.706 --> 21:51.706
-Hi.
-Hello.

21:55.422 --> 21:57.716
Would you like to come inside
for a few minutes?

21:57.716 --> 22:01.716
Yes. For a while.

22:04.682 --> 22:07.017
I was gonna make some lemonade.
You want some?

22:07.017 --> 22:10.062
Yes, I would.

22:10.062 --> 22:14.062
-Do you need any help?
-No, I know how to make lemonade.

22:17.820 --> 22:20.823
I hope we didn't embarrass you
last night.

22:20.823 --> 22:24.823
No, I wasn't embarrassed.

22:28.497 --> 22:32.497
It's kind of strange here.
Are you comfortable?

22:32.710 --> 22:36.710
Yeah, it's nice.

22:38.632 --> 22:40.634
Is something wrong?

22:40.634 --> 22:44.634
No. Everything's fine.

22:44.847 --> 22:48.434
-Are you sure you don't need help?
-No.

22:48.434 --> 22:52.434
No.

22:53.063 --> 22:57.063
Fuck.

23:47.117 --> 23:51.117
I think my dog's escaping.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.008
Watch this.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.135
-I hate this part.
-What part?

24:05.135 --> 24:07.846
The "not knowing
if he'll do it" part.

24:07.846 --> 24:11.846
Rock, go !

24:14.520 --> 24:17.439
-You like that one?
-Yeah, it's great.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.984
Come on, Rock.

24:19.984 --> 24:23.070
Come on.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.364
Tibey told me you were married.

24:25.364 --> 24:28.993
I was once. Now I'm divorced.

24:28.993 --> 24:32.329
What happened?

24:32.329 --> 24:34.873
You don't have to answer. Sorry.

24:34.873 --> 24:38.873
I guess I was married to jets
as much as I was to her.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.590
It wasn't a good way to be living.

24:43.590 --> 24:47.590
I think people love each other
the best way they know how.

24:48.012 --> 24:50.389
-You wanna try that trick?
-Sure.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.850
-You sure?
-Yeah.

24:52.850 --> 24:56.770
-You're sure you wanna try this?
-Yes, I'm positive.

24:56.770 --> 25:00.065
What?

25:00.065 --> 25:03.902
What did you say?

25:03.902 --> 25:07.902
I didn't say anything but Rocky thinks
you ought to have a blindfold.

25:08.198 --> 25:12.198
Well, Rocky's wrong.
Put it right here. Right here.

25:16.290 --> 25:20.290
Rocky. Rocky, up !

25:21.253 --> 25:23.088
Good boy, Rocky.

25:23.088 --> 25:27.088
Okay, little boy. Yes.

25:46.320 --> 25:50.320
I guess Rocky's got more sense
than both of us.

26:02.544 --> 26:06.544
Thank you. I should go.

26:12.221 --> 26:16.221
I have to go.

26:21.563 --> 26:25.563
Miryea.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.249
Are you looking for someone,
Mr. Cochran?

27:22.249 --> 27:25.085
No. Is someone looking for me?

27:25.085 --> 27:27.004
-No, senor.
-Let's get it straight.

27:27.004 --> 27:29.173
I don't like you.
You don't like me. Right?

27:29.173 --> 27:33.173
If I'm looking for someone, it's none
of your business. You understand?

30:34.149 --> 30:38.149
Out. I'm sorry, I saw it out.

30:43.909 --> 30:47.909
All right, it's match point.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.707
Out.

30:50.707 --> 30:52.542
Just out.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.002
-Well, wait.
-No, Jay.

30:54.002 --> 30:57.005
-How far in does it have to be?
-It was out.

30:57.005 --> 30:59.424
This prick's been cheating
the whole game.

30:59.424 --> 31:03.424
-Can't you humor him? I need a favor.
-We'll humor him tonight.

31:04.805 --> 31:06.348
What's the difference?

31:06.348 --> 31:08.100
I mean, can't they win?

31:08.100 --> 31:11.353
Not like this. I mean, fuck him.
These guys may be important...

31:11.353 --> 31:13.188
... but they don't mean shit to me.

31:13.188 --> 31:17.188
Besides I can't--
I can't afford to lose 500 bucks.

31:19.569 --> 31:21.905
Okay, I'm with you.

31:21.905 --> 31:25.905
All right. Match point.

31:51.017 --> 31:53.478
I got it. I got it.

31:53.478 --> 31:57.478
Oh, no, no.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.402
You all right, Nano?
It was an accident, hombre.

32:00.402 --> 32:02.237
Come on.

32:02.237 --> 32:05.365
Good game, good game. Carlos.

32:05.365 --> 32:09.365
Very fine today, huh?

32:12.789 --> 32:14.499
Tell me.

32:14.499 --> 32:18.499
Why do you want to kill
all my friends?

32:22.257 --> 32:24.926
Maybe I'm feeling
out of my element down here.

32:24.926 --> 32:28.847
Maybe you need some hamburger
and some french fries.

32:28.847 --> 32:32.847
Maybe I do.

32:33.977 --> 32:37.606
-Goddamn it.
-What's the matter?

32:37.606 --> 32:39.983
The cold war continues.

32:39.983 --> 32:43.862
Every time we fight,
she plays that Ranchero music...

32:43.862 --> 32:46.823
...which she knows I hate.

32:46.823 --> 32:50.823
It's the music I grew up with.

32:52.370 --> 32:56.370
Let me ask you something.
Do you think my wife is beautiful?

32:56.541 --> 33:00.541
-What?
-Yeah.

33:01.546 --> 33:05.546
What do you want me to say?
Of course.

33:08.887 --> 33:12.849
Because a woman like that...

33:12.849 --> 33:16.849
... you'd do almost anything
to keep her.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.203
-Madero?
-Yeah. Who's this?

33:33.203 --> 33:34.412
It's Jay.

33:34.412 --> 33:36.248
Shit, man,
where the hell are you?

33:36.248 --> 33:39.251
I'm down here in Mexico.

33:39.251 --> 33:43.251
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

33:44.589 --> 33:46.258
I think I'm fucked.

33:46.258 --> 33:50.258
What's wrong?

33:52.097 --> 33:54.599
I think I fell in love.

33:54.599 --> 33:57.269
You think you fell in love?
You don't do that.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.563
I know.

33:59.563 --> 34:03.024
With who?

34:03.024 --> 34:07.024
Who?

34:07.153 --> 34:10.824
-Tibey's wife.
-Tibey's wife?

34:10.824 --> 34:14.286
You fell in love with Tibey's wife?

34:14.286 --> 34:16.955
How could that happen?

34:16.955 --> 34:18.373
I don't know.

34:18.373 --> 34:21.751
Now, you listen to me. You get
your ass out of there right now.

34:21.751 --> 34:25.130
You put your shit in the truck,
point towards the border and drive.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.672
Are you listening to me?

34:26.672 --> 34:29.801
Here, if you fuck somebody's lady,
work it out in group therapy.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.804
There, that's serious
and they'll shoot you.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.804
Jay? Jay?

35:13.762 --> 35:17.762
I wish I could spend
more than two hours with you.

35:23.271 --> 35:27.271
Well, maybe you can.

35:31.404 --> 35:35.404
Isabella, I'm going to ask you
an enermous favor.

35:37.410 --> 35:41.410
Well, you might have to lie.

35:42.248 --> 35:46.248
Well, I've told Tibey I'm going to
visit you in Miami for a few days.

35:46.252 --> 35:49.673
No, no, no.
I'm not really coming.

35:49.673 --> 35:53.673
I'm just asking you to pretend
in case he calls.

35:58.473 --> 36:01.643
Jay, may I come in?

36:01.643 --> 36:03.728
Sure.

36:03.728 --> 36:07.728
I'm by myself.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.987
I'm on my way to a meeting.

36:11.987 --> 36:15.987
-I hope you don't mind.
-No, no.

36:16.241 --> 36:20.241
-May I have a drink of water?
-Absolutely.

36:21.162 --> 36:22.831
Please, sit.

36:22.831 --> 36:26.831
Thank you.

36:29.754 --> 36:33.754
You going somewhere?

36:37.053 --> 36:40.765
To my cabin.

36:40.765 --> 36:42.976
I've got a better idea.

36:42.976 --> 36:46.976
I'm going down to Barranquilla,
then Caracas for a few days.

36:47.772 --> 36:51.772
I would like you to fly me down.

36:52.444 --> 36:56.444
Oh, Christ, Tibey. I've only been
off a plane less than a month.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.948
You don't want to fly again?

37:01.745 --> 37:05.745
We had some wonderful times.

37:07.042 --> 37:10.545
I wish I could say yes,
but you know...

37:10.545 --> 37:14.545
... I got it in my head
about going to the cabin.

37:16.134 --> 37:20.134
As a favor?

37:22.140 --> 37:26.140
I can't, Tibey.

37:26.186 --> 37:27.896
I understand.

37:27.896 --> 37:31.896
Even simple pleasures
can become like a drug sometimes.

37:33.902 --> 37:37.902
When do you go
to your cabin, then?

37:38.615 --> 37:41.701
-I n the morning.
-We all go in the morning.

37:41.701 --> 37:44.079
I go to Caracas...

37:44.079 --> 37:46.164
... my wife to Miami...

37:46.164 --> 37:50.164
... and you, my dear friend,
to Agua Prieta...

37:50.960 --> 37:54.960
...where even a Mexican
feels lonely.

37:57.258 --> 38:01.258
As I promised.

38:01.638 --> 38:05.638
Go to Italy to fit the guns.

38:10.772 --> 38:14.772
Jay?

38:15.485 --> 38:19.485
Goodbye.

38:50.145 --> 38:54.145
I'm only going for the weekend.

39:34.898 --> 39:38.898
Second thoughts?

39:40.445 --> 39:43.656
Kiss me.

39:43.656 --> 39:47.656
Kiss me.

42:24.025 --> 42:26.736
-So?
-So?

42:26.736 --> 42:28.780
-So it's great.
-It's beautiful.

42:28.780 --> 42:32.780
-Say "great."
-Great. Great.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.960
I want to sleep right there.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.960
Wait, we're gonna eat.
We're gonna eat here.

42:50.551 --> 42:54.551
We're going to do everything here.

42:56.516 --> 43:00.516
Get out, Rock.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.200
Faithless whore !

44:01.831 --> 44:05.831
No.

44:12.592 --> 44:16.592
No !

44:46.250 --> 44:50.250
No !

44:50.546 --> 44:54.546
No !

45:09.982 --> 45:13.982
Get him up.

45:15.112 --> 45:19.112
I want you to see
what happens to whores.

45:20.034 --> 45:24.034
Your whore.

45:36.968 --> 45:40.137
You want to fuck?

45:40.137 --> 45:44.137
You will be fucked 50 times a day...

45:45.476 --> 45:49.476
... before you die.

45:53.192 --> 45:57.192
I warned you !

48:35.187 --> 48:39.187
Ramon.

53:14.008 --> 53:17.594
Don't you think
we should start getting back?

53:17.594 --> 53:20.514
Just a little further.

53:20.514 --> 53:22.182
But, compadre...

53:22.182 --> 53:26.182
... you don't become a mountain lion
in just a few days.

55:20.551 --> 55:23.178
All right, try it.

55:23.178 --> 55:27.178
Wait a second. One more time.

55:27.432 --> 55:31.432
Jesus !

55:32.312 --> 55:33.814
Here we go.

55:33.814 --> 55:37.814
It's a miracle man.

55:38.235 --> 55:42.235
The miracle is
this piece of shit ran before.

55:45.033 --> 55:48.537
La Vieja takes her walk in
the mountains early tonight.

55:48.537 --> 55:51.331
I told her you were going.

55:51.331 --> 55:53.834
I think she's angry with me.

55:53.834 --> 55:55.752
Yeah, well, she'll get over it.

55:55.752 --> 55:59.752
Maybe you'll find another gringo
in a ditch, huh?

56:10.475 --> 56:12.603
You know, compadre?

56:12.603 --> 56:15.272
I think it's good
that you are leaving.

56:15.272 --> 56:18.525
You're not a secret anymore.

56:18.525 --> 56:20.152
Does that make trouble for you?

56:20.152 --> 56:22.738
Oh, not for me, but now
there are men going around...

56:22.738 --> 56:26.738
... asking questions of an American
who may or may not be dead.

56:26.783 --> 56:30.245
The border is not that far from here.

56:30.245 --> 56:33.790
I think you'd better go there.

56:33.790 --> 56:35.500
Otherwise...

56:35.500 --> 56:38.128
... you'll never get out of Mexico alive.

56:38.128 --> 56:42.128
Thank you,
but there's someone I have to find.

56:48.096 --> 56:51.266
Tiburon Mendez is in Durango.

56:51.266 --> 56:55.266
She might be there.

58:09.553 --> 58:11.513
When does it leave?

58:11.513 --> 58:14.224
In about an hour.

58:14.224 --> 58:18.224
We would like to wait for you,
but we gotta go.

58:21.857 --> 58:23.900
She's beautiful.

58:23.900 --> 58:27.900
You should have seen her mother.

58:29.865 --> 58:33.865
Jay, I got something for you.

58:36.288 --> 58:39.166
I made it myself.

58:39.166 --> 58:43.166
Perfect for cutting the balls
off your enemy.

58:47.174 --> 58:51.174
Wait a second, all right?
Just wait a second.

58:52.054 --> 58:56.054
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

58:56.058 --> 58:57.601
-You sure?
-Yeah.

58:57.601 --> 59:01.601
-Here, let me help you.
-Thanks, friend.

59:04.274 --> 59:08.111
I'm just not up to my usual self.

59:08.111 --> 59:12.111
Mainly because I had to wrestle that
son of a bitch all the way from Texas.

59:13.617 --> 59:17.617
Probably gonna have to dope
the peckerhead before I deliver him.

59:30.717 --> 59:33.637
They're no doubt expecting
a calm and reliable stud...

59:33.637 --> 59:37.224
...which he ain't, you know.

59:37.224 --> 59:40.894
He ain't such a bad horse.
He just don't like long rides.

59:40.894 --> 59:44.022
Get up in there.

59:44.022 --> 59:46.817
Well, when I was a kid,
we had a Belgian stud.

59:46.817 --> 59:49.528
Wouldn't trailer
unless our dog went along.

59:49.528 --> 59:51.696
No kidding?

59:51.696 --> 59:55.283
Them clothes and all,
I took you for a peon.

59:55.283 --> 59:58.578
There's a cantina there.
What you say we get a little drink...

59:58.578 --> 01:00:02.165
-... and some grits, maybe?
-All right.

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.333
All right.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:07.333
-You sure you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:16.217
Tell you what. I'm plumb fucking tired
of the horse business.

01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:20.972
Thirty cents a hauled mile
plus 10 percent on the deal.

01:00:21.726 --> 01:00:25.726
Montana to Mexico City,
hauling shit for assholes.

01:00:28.817 --> 01:00:30.360
What's so funny?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.696
I haven't heard
the sound of home in a while.

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:36.696
-Where you headed?
-Durango.

01:00:37.784 --> 01:00:41.121
Oh, shit, man.

01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:44.708
Durango, huh?
Why didn't you say so?

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.877
You can ride with me in comfort.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:48.837
Maybe drive some.

01:00:48.837 --> 01:00:52.632
You don't wanna ride no bus
down in this country.

01:00:52.632 --> 01:00:56.470
You ain't no drug addict, are you?

01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:00.470
No.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:09.061
What's the matter? You look like
you've seen a ghost or something.

01:01:16.031 --> 01:01:20.031
-You ready to go?
-Yeah. Sure.

01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:28.039
Why don't you go start the car?

01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:21.926
Fuck you, amigo.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.710
-Go.
-You all right?

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:55.171
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-It looks like I picked me a winner.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.132
This thing go any faster?

01:02:57.132 --> 01:03:01.132
Well, sure.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:09.015
Sure you don't wanna come, man?

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.523
I've got this town wired.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.941
You've been driving a while.

01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:18.941
A little poontang
might ease your mind a bit.

01:03:19.613 --> 01:03:23.116
I killed a man I hated today.

01:03:23.116 --> 01:03:25.535
I gotcha.

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:29.535
Wouldn't wanna mix your pleasures.

01:03:40.675 --> 01:03:42.093
Sure you don't wanna come?

01:03:42.093 --> 01:03:44.387
No, I think I'll walk the horse.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.681
Wish me luck.

01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:50.681
-Get the door, Romeo.
-All right.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:49.512
Hey.

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.849
Hey, what are you
sleeping out here for?

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:56.603
Jesus Christ.

01:05:56.603 --> 01:05:58.188
I did it.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:01.065
The fat bitch
damn near killed me.

01:06:01.065 --> 01:06:04.027
-But I did it.
-Hey.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.821
What?

01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:10.821
She had more moves
than a rubber man from India.

01:06:11.117 --> 01:06:13.703
You gotta get to a doctor.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.289
-Hear me?
-I don't need no goddamn doctor.

01:06:16.289 --> 01:06:18.958
-You gotta get a doctor.
-I had enough of that shit.

01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:22.958
I'd rather drop dead right here.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:27.213
All right. I'll go get your stuff.

01:06:52.784 --> 01:06:56.784
How do I look, man?

01:06:56.788 --> 01:06:58.665
Like a survivor, baby.

01:06:58.665 --> 01:07:00.667
No shit?

01:07:00.667 --> 01:07:04.667
No shit.

01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:21.016
What's the deal here?

01:07:21.354 --> 01:07:23.273
God.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:27.273
I told him
to bring the money out here.

01:07:27.569 --> 01:07:29.696
I usually go in...

01:07:29.696 --> 01:07:33.491
... but I'm not feeling well.

01:07:33.491 --> 01:07:37.491
Tell you the truth, pard,
I think I'm shit-canned.

01:07:37.579 --> 01:07:41.579
I can't feel my legs.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.265
A great horse.

01:07:57.265 --> 01:08:00.143
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:04.143
I suppose we'll be able to get
out of here without being banditoed.

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:08.067
I sympathize with your concern.

01:08:08.067 --> 01:08:10.445
Look, you just--

01:08:10.445 --> 01:08:13.615
Just repeat this name to anybody
who might bother you.

01:08:13.615 --> 01:08:17.615
They'll shit down their pants
and run like rabbits.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.078
Yeah?

01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:24.078
Okay.

01:08:51.986 --> 01:08:55.986
Hey.

01:10:19.407 --> 01:10:22.952
Senor...

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.289
... I called the baron back.

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:29.834
And he's absolutely certain, senor.

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:33.834
It is Cochran.

01:10:34.672 --> 01:10:38.672
Perhaps he killed Elefante too.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.973
Hard to blame him, really.

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.693
Shall I have him killed?

01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:58.321
You don't know where he is.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:01.282
How you gonna kill him?

01:11:01.282 --> 01:11:05.282
Besides, etiquette demands
that I kill him.

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:10.162
Etiquette. I don't even know
what the word means.

01:11:19.592 --> 01:11:22.345
Hi, I'd like a room.

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:26.182
We have a rock-'n'-roll band staying.
All the singles are taken.

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:29.227
Look, I'd really like a room.

01:11:29.227 --> 01:11:32.146
Well, I remember I got one.

01:11:32.146 --> 01:11:34.357
But it is re-decorated. It's a double.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:38.357
-Okay, I'll take it.
-Sign, please, and welcome.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.199
I want my goddamn cat, pronto.
Ten times today...

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:46.327
... I told the maid, "Close the door
so the cat can't get out."

01:11:46.327 --> 01:11:48.830
She leaves the door wide open.
The cat got out.

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:52.625
You understand?
Will the rest of you please help me?

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:53.793
Precious.

01:11:53.793 --> 01:11:56.337
Oh, honey. Oh, honey.

01:11:56.337 --> 01:11:58.297
-Give me the key.
-Oh, I'm so happy.

01:11:58.297 --> 01:12:02.297
-Thank you, senor.
-We should thank that nice cowboy.

01:12:03.136 --> 01:12:07.136
Hello?

01:12:39.338 --> 01:12:40.882
Yeah?

01:12:40.882 --> 01:12:42.633
Mr. Cochran?

01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:46.633
Johnson.

01:12:47.305 --> 01:12:49.307
It was foolish
to keep the horse trailer.

01:12:49.307 --> 01:12:53.102
-What do you want?
-For myself, nothing.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:56.564
Then knock on another door.

01:12:56.564 --> 01:12:59.817
My name is Amador, Mr. Cochran.
Mauro's a friend of mine.

01:12:59.817 --> 01:13:03.817
-I don't give a shit who you are.
-He said he gave you a knife, huh?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.674
Did you hope to go unnoticed here?

01:13:23.674 --> 01:13:27.674
Don't play games with me.
I asked you a question.

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:31.803
Well, Mauro says you're looking
for the wife of Tiburon Mendez.

01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:34.393
That's a very brave
but foolish gesture.

01:13:34.393 --> 01:13:36.604
Thanks. What do you know?

01:13:36.604 --> 01:13:39.982
-Rumors.
-Yeah, like what?

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:43.819
Mexican gossip. I'll have
better information for you soon.

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:47.740
But she's alive?

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.740
Goddamn it, I asked you a question.
Is she alive?

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:58.163
Yes, she's alive.

01:14:02.213 --> 01:14:04.423
Look, I know about you.
I know your story.

01:14:04.423 --> 01:14:06.175
-You know my story?
-Yeah.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:10.175
While you're drinking my beer,
why don't you tell me yours?

01:14:13.641 --> 01:14:17.641
Mauro was married to my sister.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:20.356
She got caught up...

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:23.776
... in some business
involving Tiburon Mendez.

01:14:23.776 --> 01:14:27.776
And she was killed.

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:32.239
It happened a long time ago.

01:14:34.161 --> 01:14:37.373
You can't kill a man like Mendez
and get out of here alive.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:40.876
I didn't say I came to kill anybody,
all right?

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.712
I just want the girl.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.048
There's a chance we can get her.
But you gotta listen to me.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:50.048
I'll listen,
but I can't guarantee how long.

01:14:52.513 --> 01:14:55.725
There's a good chance
some people already know I'm here.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:58.185
Wait for me.
I'll be back later tonight.

01:14:58.185 --> 01:15:01.439
Go to the bar. There's music,
people there, mix with them.

01:15:01.439 --> 01:15:05.439
I'll get rid of the trailer.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:13.905
Don't fuck me up.

01:15:14.535 --> 01:15:18.535
You gotta learn to relax.

01:15:31.677 --> 01:15:34.764
How you doing, cowboy?

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:38.142
I'm not a cowboy.

01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:42.142
You wanna light my cigarette?

01:15:47.526 --> 01:15:51.526
Sorry, I'm just trying to make
polite conversation.

01:15:58.371 --> 01:16:02.371
That low-life was in here last night.
I think I was supposed to fall over.

01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:07.713
He's cute but he's an asshole.

01:16:07.713 --> 01:16:10.299
-Where you going?
-I'm done.

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:14.299
Don't leave me now.
You leave, and I'll make a scene.

01:16:18.015 --> 01:16:22.015
-You wanna come?
-I knew you were gonna say that.

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:27.813
Fuck you.

01:16:48.504 --> 01:16:52.504
What?

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:06.518
-Amador?
-Cochran.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:12.695
-Who's this?
-He's my cousin, Ignacio.

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:14.655
He's a tough one
from the mountains.

01:17:14.655 --> 01:17:16.991
He's gonna help us out.

01:17:16.991 --> 01:17:20.991
Let's not talk outside, okay?

01:17:26.584 --> 01:17:28.502
What's this?

01:17:28.502 --> 01:17:32.298
This is my friend.
What do you know?

01:17:32.298 --> 01:17:34.341
She's all right.
What do you know?

01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:36.719
You're not gonna like it.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:40.719
You know where she's at,
just say it.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:47.726
She's in a whorehouse.

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.952
Where?

01:18:01.952 --> 01:18:03.412
I don't know yet.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:06.081
She's in a whorehouse
and nobody knows where?

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:09.084
I'm gonna find out.
You gotta give me some time.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.003
-I know how to find out.
-What?

01:18:11.003 --> 01:18:14.632
It means I got my own lead. I saw a
guy in the bar a couple of hours ago.

01:18:14.632 --> 01:18:18.052
I don't know his face
but I know his boots.

01:18:18.052 --> 01:18:21.430
-No. Wait.
-He works for Tibey.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.641
You gotta fucking wait.
It's a mistake.

01:18:23.641 --> 01:18:27.641
I'm tired of waiting.

01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:37.863
Now, listen to me.
We'll handle it.

01:18:37.863 --> 01:18:39.615
Where is this guy?

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.784
I told you, he's in the hotel bar.

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:44.787
You can't go in the bar like this.
You can't go in with a gun.

01:18:44.787 --> 01:18:47.289
Now, tell me what he looks like.

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:49.625
All right, all right.
Tell me about the boots.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:53.625
He wears black-and-white
silver-tip boots.

01:18:54.213 --> 01:18:58.213
He's coming to the show tonight.
I can get him a backstage pass.

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:04.344
Yeah, that would be good.

01:19:47.224 --> 01:19:51.224
No.

01:20:23.344 --> 01:20:25.346
What happened?

01:20:25.346 --> 01:20:29.346
We brought you a present.

01:20:29.933 --> 01:20:33.933
Senor Boots.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.739
Where is she?

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:45.658
He wishes to make love
with your mother.

01:20:45.658 --> 01:20:49.658
I know what the fucker said.

01:20:50.537 --> 01:20:51.914
That's an odd request.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:54.917
So how far is this?
What is this, 20 miles?

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:57.920
-It's about 20 miles, give or take.
-You know the place?

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.422
Yeah, we know the place.

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.132
We can get there in an hour?

01:21:02.132 --> 01:21:05.052
No, no, no. It's Saturday night, man.
The place is full.

01:21:05.052 --> 01:21:07.179
-Fuck it, man.
-Forget about it.

01:21:07.179 --> 01:21:11.179
I'm going there myself.
You don't have to come.

01:21:14.478 --> 01:21:18.399
You're right. I don't have to come,
but I wanna tell you something.

01:21:18.399 --> 01:21:22.399
Tiburon Mendez has been hard on a lot
of people and I'll spare you the details.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:27.616
Goddamn it, Cochran,
will you trust me?

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:31.616
Let's do this thing at dawn.

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:37.626
What about him?

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:41.626
We've known him since we were kids.
If we let him live, could he forgive us?

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:47.340
Walk away.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.700
They know me here.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:19.164
Where is she?

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:26.504
-Who is this?
-She's the madam.

01:22:28.302 --> 01:22:30.304
You know where she is.

01:22:30.304 --> 01:22:33.557
Where is she? You speak English?

01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:36.435
Tell me, then. Where is she?

01:22:36.435 --> 01:22:40.435
Maybe a house in Mazatlán
where they are rich.

01:22:44.318 --> 01:22:48.318
And she was very popular.

01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:05.001
Where?

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.891
If she's not where you say...

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:19.891
... I'm gonna come back and kill you.

01:23:27.986 --> 01:23:31.986
She doesn't know.

01:23:43.877 --> 01:23:46.839
Stop. Stop.

01:23:46.839 --> 01:23:50.839
Stop. Stop.

01:24:14.241 --> 01:24:17.536
Assure Senor Mendez
that he'll be in our prayers.

01:24:17.536 --> 01:24:21.536
We'll never forget it, Mary.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.938
Qué pasó, shit!
It's the same thing.

01:24:44.938 --> 01:24:47.858
He hunts in the morning,
he comes back in the afternoon.

01:24:47.858 --> 01:24:50.444
Nothing's changed.

01:24:50.444 --> 01:24:54.444
He's not gonna lead us to her.

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:01.492
I ought to just scope the son of a bitch
from right here.

01:25:05.334 --> 01:25:09.334
I don't give a shit
if he knows who killed him or not.

01:25:10.923 --> 01:25:14.923
There's a new man.

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.848
Riding with Tibey?

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:22.184
His name's Resabio.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:24.227
It's strange.

01:25:24.227 --> 01:25:27.272
Mendez must be very scared.

01:25:27.272 --> 01:25:29.942
-Why?
-Because that fucker is a mad dog.

01:25:29.942 --> 01:25:33.942
He can't be controlled.

01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:39.409
So, what do you wanna do?

01:25:39.409 --> 01:25:42.412
Well, this sure as fuck ain't working.

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:46.412
Okay, let's go back to the town.
I'll ask a little harder.

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:09.439
Ramon...

01:26:09.439 --> 01:26:12.234
... how long have you been with me?

01:26:12.234 --> 01:26:13.860
Eleven years, Patrón.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:17.860
Have I treated you well?

01:26:18.657 --> 01:26:22.657
Then why do you
show me no respect?

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:25.956
I do, patrón.

01:26:25.956 --> 01:26:29.956
Pablo says no.

01:26:30.836 --> 01:26:34.836
You've taken advantage of my wife.

01:26:36.174 --> 01:26:40.174
Maybe-- Maybe I can understand it.

01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:44.307
But then I hear you go around...

01:26:44.307 --> 01:26:48.307
... bragging that you
are going to kill her.

01:26:49.813 --> 01:26:53.813
You've forgotten something
very important.

01:26:56.987 --> 01:27:00.987
You've forgotten whose wife she is.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.700
No.

01:27:53.585 --> 01:27:56.505
It's bad.

01:27:56.505 --> 01:27:58.507
She's very sick.

01:27:58.507 --> 01:28:02.507
Nobody knows where she is
or no one's talking.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.268
It's time to talk to Tibey.

01:28:10.268 --> 01:28:11.853
It's gonna be very dangerous.

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:15.853
There's nothing else I can do.
I can't wait anymore.

01:28:17.109 --> 01:28:21.109
I don't know how to say....

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:25.075
Thank you. I'm in your debt.

01:28:25.075 --> 01:28:29.075
You're a crazy son of a bitch,
Cochran, but we're with you.

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:45.883
Tibey rides this trail
every morning at dawn.

01:28:49.432 --> 01:28:52.978
You know, he's gonna think
you're a ghost.

01:28:52.978 --> 01:28:56.978
Be sure to keep your hands empty
and out where he can see them.

01:28:57.023 --> 01:29:01.023
Trust us, okay?

01:29:01.194 --> 01:29:04.573
I trust you,
but no matter what happens...

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:08.368
... you don't kill him, I do.

01:29:08.368 --> 01:29:12.368
Got it.

01:30:48.802 --> 01:30:52.802
Where is she?

01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:07.650
Perhaps we both deserve to die.

01:31:09.656 --> 01:31:13.656
Maybe.

01:31:27.674 --> 01:31:30.844
I ask you now, as a man...

01:31:30.844 --> 01:31:34.014
... and a former friend...

01:31:34.014 --> 01:31:37.017
...to ask my forgiveness...

01:31:37.017 --> 01:31:41.017
...for taking my wife
away from me.

01:31:57.037 --> 01:32:01.037
I ask your forgiveness...

01:32:01.875 --> 01:32:05.875
...for taking your wife
away from you.

01:32:17.515 --> 01:32:21.269
She's in the convent...

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:25.269
... in Morito.

01:32:39.204 --> 01:32:43.204
Senor? Senor? Senor?

01:32:58.807 --> 01:33:02.807
-I want to see her.
-She is very sick.

01:34:26.311 --> 01:34:30.311
I love you.

01:34:43.495 --> 01:34:47.495
She wants to go outside.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.720
I love you.
