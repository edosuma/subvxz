Panic attack,
panic attack, panic attack!

01:02.440 --> 01:04.396
God!

01:39.880 --> 01:41.950
Health, health, health, darling!

01:51.440 --> 01:55.479
- Washing machine.
- That's absolutley right, sweetie.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.195
Feeling great I expect this morning are you?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.550
Fabulous, darling.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.836
Oh God! Patsy can put it away
can't she sweety?

02:10.199 --> 02:13.237
Oh God! Stop looking at me like that, sweetie!

02:13.960 --> 02:18.112
What do I have to do to convince you

02:22.240 --> 02:25.118
I had one bloody drink, sweetie!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.195
You know are you accusing me of something?

02:28.400 --> 02:32.837
Have you looked in the mirror this morning?
Your eye bags are rouged.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.358
- What are you eating there?
- Toast.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.159
- What is that on the toast?
- It's honey, Mother.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.912
Honey? That's not honey, that's my
bloody royal jelly moisturiser, sweetie.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.910
Good God, you are eating 300 pounds
worth of royal jelly, darling.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.954
It's been hand-squished
out of a bee's backside.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.994
And not any old bloody bee,
but the bloody Gucci of bees, darling.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.113
This is the stuff that Jackie Stallone
would kill for this, darling.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.230
That's better.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.636
- Make me a cup of coffee,darling.
- You know where it is, make it yourself.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.355
- I don't know where it bloody is, do I?
- Please don't swear.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.430
Sweetie, make mum a cup of coffee.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.679
You're so clever and you know
where everything is darling, don't you?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.839
I think it's marvellous the way
you know where everything is. You're marvellous.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.510
Flattery won't turn me into your servant.
The coffee is in front of you.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.917
Pick up a spoon, put coffee in cup,
pour on boiling water.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.749
Scald hands, get third-degree burns,
scream in agony...

03:41.960 --> 03:45.077
Do you really want that
on your conscience this morning?

03:45.280 --> 03:49.159
- Alright...
- Thank you, sweetheart.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.920
No, not instant, darling, not instant.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.793
Grind some beans, for God's sake.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.152
Instant coffee is just old beans that
have been cremated. I don't want them.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.432
I want them entire
with life force today.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.999
Could you not pull that face
while you grind?

04:10.200 --> 04:13.954
I don't really want to drink
a cup full of your anger.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.879
Anyway, I shouldn't be drinking coffee.
I shouldn't be bloody drinking coffee

04:17.079 --> 04:21.392
I don't want any coffee, throw it away,.
I don't want any bloody coffee!

04:25.360 --> 04:29.751
I just wanted some
fennel twig tea or something.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.832
Look at the time, sweetie.
I should be in the office!

04:39.040 --> 04:42.396
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie!
Tell them my car hasn't arrived,

04:42.600 --> 04:45.478
there's traffic door-to- door
and I'm not well!

04:45.680 --> 04:48.240
Hello? My mother's sitting here
in her dressing gown...

04:50.800 --> 04:55.157
it's just me, darling. "Dressing gown",
sha knows nothing about fashion.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.874
Now listen, sweetie.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.356
I'm literally out of the door
when my bloody car turns up,

05:01.560 --> 05:04.632
and I'm managing to
keep a lid on things this end alright?

05:04.840 --> 05:07.877
I know you can manage that end,
Bubble darling, alright?

05:08.080 --> 05:11.231
I'm chanting as we speak.
Bye-bye, darling.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.273
You're not a Buddhist,
you wouldn't understand.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.995
Mum, you did it for a week,
which admittedly for you is a record.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.397
It's not a fad, darling.
It's not like crystals.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.993
please, stop it!

05:42.560 --> 05:48.351
Sweetie, you wouldn't say that if you
knew how much we owe to my chanting darling.

05:49.080 --> 05:54.200
This house wouldn't be here, darling.
I chanted for this gorgeous house!

05:54.400 --> 05:57.358
I chanted to be successful
and believe in myself.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.030
Please let me make some more money
so I can buy Saffron books and a car.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.310
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

06:08.640 --> 06:12.076
In Buddhist obviously...
not in English, when I do it properly.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.159
- What is it, some sort of cosmic cash machine?
- Oh God!

06:16.360 --> 06:21.354
could you try not being so cynical today.
Today I need just a little bit of bloody support.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.755
Why is today such a panic, anyway?

06:23.960 --> 06:27.236
It's only a fashion show
and you've had six months to prepare it.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.159
Why is everything
always so hysterical?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.716
All you've got to do
is play a bit of music, turn on the lights,

06:33.920 --> 06:35.876
get some people
who have thrown up everything they've ever eaten

06:36.080 --> 06:38.150
and send them down a catwalk.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.796
Greater feats have been achieved
in less time and with less fuss.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.956
Not quite with it, darling, are you?

06:44.160 --> 06:48.438
Major motion pictures are made,
huge concerts are put on in stadiums...

06:48.640 --> 06:52.269
I mean for God's sake, 500,000 troops
were mobilised in the Gulf,

06:52.480 --> 06:56.109
a war fought and won in less time, without
everyone involved having a nervous breakdown

06:56.320 --> 07:00.836
and being sent flowers.
It can't be that difficult.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.192
Darling, every troop didn't have to
contain Yasmin Le Bon.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.076
The generals didn't require "big hugs"
after every manoeuvre,

07:09.280 --> 07:11.555
and the whole operation
did not have to be co-ordinated

07:11.760 --> 07:13.796
to rap and
Japanese avant-garde pipe music.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.199
Because I think if it had, the outcome
might have been rather different, don't you?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.553
mmm?

07:22.760 --> 07:26.958
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm going to go and get dressed.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.031
Forgot to ring Chukhani. He was
going to channel a colour for me today.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.237
Chukhani, it's Edina.
Green. Thank you, darling.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.314
Don't look at me like that.
There's more to it.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.273
- Of course, there is. The bill.
- Sweetie, sweetie.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.631
He doesn't just choose the colour...
Listen,cause you might learn something now.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.389
He doesn't just choose
the colour himself, darling.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.717
It is related to who I was
in a previous existence.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.354
And who was it you were
in a previous life?

08:07.560 --> 08:10.472
I suppose you were
the Elizabeth Taylor of the Ming dynasty?

08:10.680 --> 08:11.954
Well close, yes.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.355
So how come you've ended up just
a mad, fat, old cow?

08:18.160 --> 08:21.277
Will you stop saying that word "fat"?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.951
Stop it, now! Stop it!

08:27.520 --> 08:31.399
I know you're only saying it
to annoy me. Aren't you, darling?

08:31.600 --> 08:34.068
No, I'm saying it because it's true...

08:37.840 --> 08:41.309
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God...

08:43.000 --> 08:45.150
What happened, then?

08:45.360 --> 08:49.194
Why do you have to pick on everything I do?
All I want are a few little things,

08:49.400 --> 08:53.234
a few little pleasures, a few little crutches
to help me get through life, darling.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.194
Get through? Mum, you've
absolved yourself of responsiblity.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.551
You live from self-induced crisis
to self-induced crisis.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.718
Someone does your hair,someone chooses
what you wear,someone does your brain,

09:03.920 --> 09:05.911
someone tells you what to eat,
and three times a week

09:06.120 --> 09:10.193
someone sticks a hose up your bum
and flushes it all out of you.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.432
It's called colonic irrigation, darling.
It's not to be sniffed at.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.155
Why can't you just go to the toilet
like normal people?

09:22.360 --> 09:28.151
Is that what you really want me to be darling, normal?
Some boring, old, normal old toilet goer?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.396
hmmm?

09:30.600 --> 09:33.990
"Where's Mummy?".
"She's on the toilet. "

09:34.200 --> 09:36.509
"But I want to go to somewhere interesting
and meet exciting people. "

09:36.720 --> 09:38.676
"well she can't take you because she's on the bloody toilet. "

09:38.880 --> 09:40.996
well anybody can go to the toilet, they say.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.760
well they obviously,
haven't seen you drunk...

09:43.960 --> 09:47.191
What do you mean by that remark?

09:47.400 --> 09:50.153
Can I just say thank you,
bloody thank you,

09:50.360 --> 09:52.112
so stop doing that now!

09:52.320 --> 09:54.914
Thank you so bloody much
for giving me such a lot of support

09:55.120 --> 09:57.236
on this bloody important day...

09:58.640 --> 10:02.838
darling a lot of daughters might have
offered to come with me and help, but no, not you.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.157
You've probably got something rather
interesting to listen to on Radio 4 have you?...

10:07.360 --> 10:12.354
...or some new exhibit of test-tubes
at the Science Museum to go and see.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.111
It doesn't matter,
I'll just go on my own.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.236
There's a little party afterwards,you know darling,

10:20.440 --> 10:24.479
but i'll probably just go on my own to that
as well, shall i?

10:34.440 --> 10:36.635
- No.
- Oh Come on, darling. Sweetheart...

10:36.840 --> 10:39.718
It's your drama-you act in it.
I won't be your accessory.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.717
"What should i wear
the daughter with the Dior?".

10:41.920 --> 10:45.833
"Oh look at Edina isn't she marvellous and she's got
a family, I don't know how she does it. How clever!"

10:46.040 --> 10:48.554
- Time of the month, darling?
- No.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.912
Just thought you looked as if
you were retaining a little water down here.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.113
Darling, if you want to lose weight sweetie
I've got some marvellous pills upstairs darling.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.278
You just pee it out overnight.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.357
Alright...

11:03.560 --> 11:05.755
- You're not seeing your father tonight are you darling?
- No.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.758
- Good.
- Go and get dressed.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.153
Darling. Darling, look at Mummy.
Look at Mummy, sweetie.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.994
Do I need surgery, darling?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.794
- Yes.
- Alright.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.912
Get your mouth sewn up.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.310
I'm still here, darling. I heard that.

11:36.680 --> 11:41.276
Yes well i pay you to interpret my dreams,
so can't you at least find a hidden depth?

11:41.480 --> 11:44.756
Well, I'm not willing to believe
I'm simply that obvious

11:45.720 --> 11:49.952
And if you're a bloody psychic psychologist,
how come i'm always having to call you?

11:50.160 --> 11:52.230
Oh just stuff it!

11:52.440 --> 11:56.831
Saffy darling, I'm off, but I won't see you later,
because you don't love me enough darling.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.676
Lacroix, sweetie!

12:04.720 --> 12:08.474
It's alright, isn't it?
it's a bit tight maybe, but it's alright, isn't it?

12:08.680 --> 12:11.956
You know, people will think,
"Wow, it's a Lacroix!" OK?

12:12.160 --> 12:14.071
I just can't find anything to go with it that's all.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.556
Maybe I can throw up
on something for you?

12:17.760 --> 12:20.354
- Oh I see. Someone already has.
- Jean Muir.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.030
Bloody door! It will be my car.
Sweetie, it will be my car.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.798
- Darling.
- Pats, darling.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.310
Sweetie, your car's here.
I thought I might scrounge a coffee.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.717
Well darling, I can't
I'm in a dreadful rush. I can't...

12:35.920 --> 12:37.751
Saff is here, though alright?

12:37.960 --> 12:40.758
- What are you wearing Eddy?
- Lacroix.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.030
- It's fabulous.
- Good, thank you.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.630
- Patsy could go with you, Mother.
- Yes, why don't you come with me in the car?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.990
We'll talk in the car. Alright, darling?

12:49.200 --> 12:53.432
Bye-bye, sweetie, darling bye bye.
Have a little haircut, have a little bob.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.993
- Don't be...
- What darling?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.953
- Don't be late.
- Alright, sweetie.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.998
Or drunk...

13:06.800 --> 13:10.076
Darliing, stop me drinking today.
Saff has threatened to leave home again.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.679
darling you don't drink.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.235
look i know i'm not a drinker,
but you know what she's like i mean...

13:14.440 --> 13:17.079
A pig.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.113
God, I must ring in
and tell them I'm coming.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.518
- What will you drink if you stop drinking?
- I shall drink water.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.553
It's a mixer, Patsy.
We have it with whisky.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.274
You know what it's like.
You've given up drinking before.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.277
worst eight hours of my life.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.472
Right, it's me. I'm on my way in.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.513
Everything's completely under control this end,
how is it with you?

13:38.720 --> 13:42.713
Lights, models, guest list?

13:43.640 --> 13:46.837
Just do your best, darling.
I'm rushing. Bye.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.790
- Are you going straight to the office?
- Yes.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.036
- Past Harvey Nic's?
- No, Pats

13:53.840 --> 13:58.436
Could we?
Well, it is nearly lunch-time.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.359
- 10:30, Patsy.
- mmm!

14:04.440 --> 14:08.069
well look we can do Harvey Nichols quickly
and then we'll pick up some lunch

14:08.280 --> 14:10.191
and just take it into the office.
I think it would look better.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.958
Whatever.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.357
But darling remember it's your company.
You're the boss, you can do what you want.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.599
- Don't let them pressure you.
- I'll just ring and tell them. Shall i?

14:20.840 --> 14:24.230
- You'll kill yourself the way you go on.
- Yes, i'll ring them later.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.315
Darling, you will come
to the show tonight, won't you?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.193
Saffy's refused you know
and I need just a little bit of support.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.597
Well, of course you do
and of course I will.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.189
Deserted by son and daughter.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.915
Where is Serge? Where is Serge?

14:42.120 --> 14:46.193
Potholing with his university,
I don't want to talk about it.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.755
I sometimes wonder
what the point of having children is

14:48.960 --> 14:51.394
if they're not going to turn up
to your launches?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.909
Did you tell them how important
it was for you darling?

14:54.120 --> 14:58.352
Did i tell them? I faxed the bloody dean,
the bollocky halls of residence

14:58.560 --> 15:01.393
and the buggery mountain rescue.
What more can I do?

15:01.600 --> 15:04.478
Nothing, and you shouldn't have to.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.638
I mean, look at you.
You've been a fantastic mother.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.515
You've let them ruin your figure.
Your stomach's stretched beyond recognition,

15:11.720 --> 15:14.154
you've got tits down to your knees,
and what for, for godsake?

15:14.360 --> 15:17.750
For a potholer who's worn nothing but a purple
nylon tracksuit and a Gazza t-shirt

15:17.960 --> 15:21.111
for the past two years.
Cut the cord, darling.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.357
- Left here if we're going to Harvey Nic's.
- Left!

15:27.480 --> 15:30.756
We're going to San Fred's
for lunch and then we're going shopping.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.913
Eddy, can I borrow your phone?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.557
Thanks. I'm glad you're with me Pats,
because otherwise I wouldn't use that car.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.389
I wouldn't use that huge car pouring out
petrol fumes and pollution like that,

16:01.600 --> 16:05.036
but you know there were three people
in that car. Three people in that car!

16:05.240 --> 16:07.549
Oh shut up, Eddy.
No one can hear you.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.876
darling it's me.
I'm coming into the office now.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.878
I'm coming through the door.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.156
right i'm here, darling.
Don't panic, don't panic. I'm here.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.797
Right, Bubble. Let's get things moving.
Sweetie, darling, I'm sorry i'm so late.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.116
I think everything's just about done.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.356
I told you
things would manage without you darling.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.429
Right. Now, Bubble,
did all the models turn up?

16:33.640 --> 16:35.392
- Yeah every single one.
- Good, good.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.591
Except one.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.793
Except one? You're not going to
tell me it's Yasmin Le Bon, darling?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.353
- No.
- Thank God!

16:44.560 --> 16:47.950
No, sorry, yeah.
Yasmin Le Bon is ill.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.513
Oh my buggery bollocks.
Why the bloody hell didn't you tell me earlier?

16:54.720 --> 16:57.439
Well, her husband's just phoned
and said "Simon Le Bon",

16:57.640 --> 16:59.756
which I thought was really amusing.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.439
Amusiing, darling?

17:02.640 --> 17:06.553
Yeah. Very modern of him
to take his wife's name.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.113
Bubble, sweetie...

17:08.319 --> 17:11.039
I phoned round
and I think I may have found a replacement.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.992
- Good, good. Who?
- Betty Boo.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.917
Shit.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.438
Some of the designers aren't happy,
but I said you'd speak to them.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.676
- This is all your fault, Patsy.
- It's all fixable.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.474
Yes, you're right. Come on,
how is the celebrity and VIP list looking?

17:25.680 --> 17:28.558
Good, I think.
But you know me, I don't know anybody.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.671
Come on, darling.
Come on, darling!

17:30.880 --> 17:33.792
Just tell me about Joan Collins,
Stephanie Powers, Paloma Picasso,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.878
Charlotte Rampliing, Catheriine Denueve.
Give me some names, darling.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.593
- So far?
- So far.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.190
So far Sinitta and
Anne Robinson definite.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.518
We're still chasing Anneka Rice.
Gave up on Norma Major.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.349
Just get me my phone book now,
would you darling? Get me my phone book.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.596
I mean Princess Di has to have somebody
to sit next to.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.519
- You don't get Princess Di...
- Anne, Anne.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.439
Princess Anne.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.153
As well as is it darling?

18:03.360 --> 18:06.750
Instead of. Only.
Possibly with daughter.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.832
Why, why?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.270
There was a bit of a mix-up.
I didn't make the call,

18:12.480 --> 18:14.596
but she's very game
and a really nice person.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.189
I wouldn't care if she was
Mother bloody Teresa!

18:17.400 --> 18:19.152
It doesn't matter for our purposes.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.716
What we need is a princess with a press
following and a designer dress on her back!

18:22.920 --> 18:25.229
Not someone who looks like
she runs up her own.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.790
well her people were a bit cagey about
which designer she favoured.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.877
The only label she wears is "drip dry".

18:34.080 --> 18:36.196
Come on, come on, come on, darling!

18:36.400 --> 18:39.153
Let's take stock now.
We've got three hours.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.920
darling finish the beaujolais
and walk away, from it.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.918
- Shut up now, Patsy.
- Right, I'm off.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.635
- Are we eating?
- Yes what of. French, Italian, whatever you like.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.717
Oh darling no one's eating
that sort of food any more.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.639
but there's a fabulous
new Japanese in Mayfair.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.434
Everything is raw.
Anything which has a pulse is lunch.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.312
Alright, darling, whatever.

18:58.520 --> 19:02.195
The magazine called for you, Patsy. They need
some decisions about this month's cover.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.356
oh really!
Whatever can they need to know?

19:04.560 --> 19:09.634
I mean it's the same every month, a model
in make-up with a vacant look on her face.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.195
well i might drop in on the way home.
see you later eddy, i'll leave the bottle.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.358
no don't leave the bottle, Patsy.
I need a clear head forthe next three hours darling.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.198
- Do you want some coke?
- No, sweetie no.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.790
- No, shh!
- Save it 'till later. Good luck, darling.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.517
Have you got something I can pee into?
I want to do another test before i go.

19:25.720 --> 19:30.032
Bloody hell, Patsy!
Wash it this time, will you?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.914
Anyway,darling who was it you were with last night?

19:35.120 --> 19:38.271
He was just a windscreen washer
I picked up at the traffic lights.

19:38.480 --> 19:42.268
- Buns so tight he was bouncing off the walls.
- Bye, Pats Darling, bye.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.313
- Bye-bye, sweetheart. Bye, darling.
- Goodbye, sweetie.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.717
- darling, you are a fabulous, wonderful individual
- Thank you.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.275
and remember, i've known you longer
than your daughter

19:51.480 --> 19:55.029
and anything you do is alright by me.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.879
- Can I take your car?
- Sweetie!

19:58.080 --> 20:00.878
Well, as long as it's back by six,
I'm alright.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.278
Bye, Eddy. Thanks, darling.

20:03.480 --> 20:09.157
Right. Now, Bubble, I want
a list of every PR company,

20:09.360 --> 20:12.193
every record company in the country,
I want a copy of "Who's Who?"

20:12.400 --> 20:16.279
and the latest edition of Hello! Magazine.
Let's get "celebritied" up! Come on!

20:17.040 --> 20:22.160
Bubble, I want four huge video screens
down either side of the catwalk.

20:22.360 --> 20:26.273
I want to flash-up pictures of sad,
but beautiful children, happy gay couples,

20:26.480 --> 20:30.155

"No Pollution", "Fashion Cares".Alright darling?

and make sure she realises
that if she doesn't

20:55.080 --> 20:57.913

that put Princess Anne
in a Vivienne Westwood basque.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.036
People weren't even looking
at what was happening on the catwalk.

22:31.240 --> 22:36.189
Good job, really darling. Betty Boo and
Danii Minogue did their best, but frankly...

22:36.400 --> 22:39.358

22:42.280 --> 22:45.238

22:45.440 --> 22:47.670
Are we keeping these two?

22:47.880 --> 22:51.668
No, I thought we'd get
a couple of different ones at the party.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.798
If I squat down i'll piss myself.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.555

Don't start making me
go on holiday, Pats!

23:30.040 --> 23:32.600
Darling, you need a holiday...

I'm sorry.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.352
What was I saying, Patsy?

24:12.560 --> 24:14.471
You were just going to
tell me about their bastard...

24:14.680 --> 24:17.035
Bastard bloody fathers!

24:17.920 --> 24:20.878
God, I married the two biggest shits

24:21.080 --> 24:22.354
Unhh...?

24:27.120 --> 24:29.429
do you know i don't know why
it went wrong with Justin,

24:29.640 --> 24:32.916
because we just
adored each other, you know?

24:33.120 --> 24:35.076
He's gay.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.795
No, Patsy,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.595
- Oh let's go on holiday...

24:42.800 --> 24:46.475

I've had a drink, darling.

24:46.680 --> 24:49.592

- Darliing, you're only slightly drunk.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.918
- I can't let her know I've had a drink.
- Come on, sweetie.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.396
- Go on, sweetie, go on.
- She'll never know, will she, darling?

24:57.600 --> 25:02.913
- She's not your bloody mother!
- She's not my bloody mother!

25:03.120 --> 25:05.634
Mother never knew...
did she, Pats? Remember?

25:07.240 --> 25:11.313
Oh far out!
Oh that's fantastic!

25:24.040 --> 25:26.838
- Are you going to come in?
- No.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.351
Ciao.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.630
Hello, Edwina dear.
Good concert?

25:58.840 --> 26:01.229
Why don't you come in
and tell us all about it?

26:01.440 --> 26:03.431
Your father and I are still up.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.635
I'm very tired, actually.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.709
Come on, dear.
Your father would love to see you.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.157
Hi.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.155
Here she is.

26:30.360 --> 26:33.033
Where was the concert

26:33.240 --> 26:35.879
Eel Pie Island again, was it?

26:36.080 --> 26:38.992

Anyone we should have heard of?

26:39.200 --> 26:42.909
The Beatles,
The Stones, The Rolling Who?

26:43.120 --> 26:46.715
You look a bit dizzy, dear.
Are you OK?

26:48.480 --> 26:51.711
Is that cider I can smell
on your breath?

27:01.560 --> 27:03.278
No, she's not.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.472
It's alright, darling, she's not here.
She's not here, darling.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.717
Oh God! The pig's here.
Come on, sweetie.

27:11.640 --> 27:14.837

28:21.320 --> 28:24.949
Where's my joint box?
You've stolen it again.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.835
What do you want that for?
Where is it, darling?

28:29.040 --> 28:34.478
Oh sweetie.
Help Mummy now, help Mummy.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.750
Do you want
a glass of water?

28:37.720 --> 28:41.349
Oh hang on a moment.
Mum, it's the Betty Ford Clinic.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.554

28:46.760 --> 28:51.197
They say they are confirming the booking
for four weeks from next Monday.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.916
sweetie i think it's the only way.
Don't you, darling?

28:59.160 --> 29:02.391
I'm going to swallow my pride
and do it, if that's alright by you.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.352
You've been very good to me. Thank you darling.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.677
- Well done!
