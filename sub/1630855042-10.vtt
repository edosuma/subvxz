00:01.947 --> 00:04.686
(faint, indistinct chatter)

00:04.786 --> 00:06.122
(both laugh)

00:06.222 --> 00:08.460
- (indistinct chatter)
- (chuckles)

00:08.594 --> 00:11.399
But enough about my past,
I want to hear about yours.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.905
Who was the first guy
that you were in love with?

00:14.005 --> 00:16.342
Okay. (chuckles)
His name was Billy Blum.

00:16.442 --> 00:17.712
Was he gorgeous?

00:17.812 --> 00:19.616
- So gorgeous. Oh, my God,
I was so obsessed
- Yeah.

00:19.716 --> 00:20.985
- with him.
- Sure.

00:21.085 --> 00:22.789
Mm. All we ever did was kiss.

00:22.889 --> 00:24.058
We tried to keep it a secret,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.528
but then we came
into school one day,

00:25.628 --> 00:27.131
both of us had poison ivy.

00:27.231 --> 00:29.468
'Cause you were rolling around
in the ivy with Blum?

00:29.603 --> 00:30.872
- Yeah, yeah.
- You dog.

00:30.972 --> 00:33.210
- In the back 40.
- The back 40?

00:33.310 --> 00:35.715
- (laughs) Yeah.
- What is that,
a Canadian phrase?

00:35.815 --> 00:37.117
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I like that.

00:37.218 --> 00:38.588
That was real love.

00:38.688 --> 00:40.959
- What about you?
- Mm.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.996
- Eighth grade.
- Mm.

00:42.996 --> 00:44.700
- Bus stop.
- Mm.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.868
Brittany Parker shows up.

00:45.868 --> 00:47.204
- Mm-hmm.
- Rocks the foundation

00:47.304 --> 00:49.843
- of my soul.
- (laughs)

00:49.843 --> 00:52.515
That's first loves for you, huh?

00:52.616 --> 00:55.020
Yeah. I mean...

00:55.120 --> 00:57.024
- Mm?
- I was

00:57.124 --> 00:58.995
beginning to think that
that type of love

00:59.095 --> 01:02.201
only existed
when you were a kid.

01:06.142 --> 01:09.015
(whispers):
Are we crazy?

01:09.148 --> 01:11.553
I don't know, but...

01:11.654 --> 01:13.824
I would be crazy

01:13.925 --> 01:16.029
one million times over

01:16.129 --> 01:19.101
if it meant being crazy
with you.

01:24.278 --> 01:26.517
- DIRECTOR: And cut.
- (buzzer sounds)

01:26.517 --> 01:29.255
- That was such a good take.
- Yeah.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.092
- I fucking felt that one.
- Me, too.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.428
Hey, was that good for camera?

01:32.529 --> 01:34.065
- DIRECTOR: Yeah, good.
- DAVE: Okay, cool.

01:34.198 --> 01:35.367
- Uh...
- Whew.

01:35.367 --> 01:36.937
I feel, like,
really well covered

01:37.037 --> 01:38.440
- with this outro scene.
- RACHEL: Thank you.

01:38.541 --> 01:40.377
What I would love--
I know you have a hard out,

01:40.477 --> 01:41.914
but before you go, is there any
way we could get, like, one more

01:42.014 --> 01:44.418
- crack at the verse?
- Fuck yeah.

01:44.519 --> 01:46.289
- Let's do it.
- Okay. Great. All right,

01:46.389 --> 01:48.494
we're gonna do the verse
and the hook one more time.

01:48.594 --> 01:51.065
Reset, everyone. Back to one.
Let's change and get to it.

01:51.065 --> 01:52.368
DIRECTOR:
Yeah, that's great. Let's do it.

01:52.468 --> 01:54.071
Okay, get Brad back
to his one, please.

01:54.171 --> 01:56.610
DIRECTOR:
All right, and hit it, Peter.

was squeaking on that one.

Oh, we're not even getting
sound. It's a music video.

That's just the...

03:38.079 --> 03:39.482
- And we're...?
- Yeah.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.687
I think it's kind of cooler
to not overuse you.

- Great.
- Yeah.

Tell me, are you gonna call

Oh, my God,
stop harassing me about it.

- You...

03:53.376 --> 03:55.681
I just call him
and ask him like that?

03:55.681 --> 03:58.521
No, no, no, no, no. He only
responds to grocery terms,

03:58.521 --> 04:00.123
so if you want one,
say "carrot."

04:00.223 --> 04:01.760
If you want a bunch,
say "bananas."

04:01.860 --> 04:03.096
Bananas?

Newt?

Trust me. All right?

- Yeah.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.610
Guess that's it, huh?

04:26.710 --> 04:27.946
- Okay.

04:28.046 --> 04:31.085
I haven't had that much fun
on set in literal years.

04:31.185 --> 04:33.323

my dreams come true.

04:39.201 --> 04:41.540
Oh, my God, stop.

paparazzi looking in

anything was possible, so...

07:03.590 --> 07:05.393
- Fuck yeah. Good shit.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

07:05.494 --> 07:07.431

No what ifs, right?
- Yeah, beautiful shit.

07:07.532 --> 07:09.368

- Oh, absolutely.
- Hey.

07:13.644 --> 07:14.779

with all the raw footage
from the documentary.

07:18.219 --> 07:20.323

around the footage that...
- Don't worry about it.

07:22.027 --> 07:23.396
I want to talk to you
about schedule next week.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.367
Load me up, brother. I am ready.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.204
You've been going super hard,
Dave, okay?

07:27.304 --> 07:28.741
And I know it's
a good distraction

07:28.741 --> 07:30.276
- from Robyn, but I think
maybe, like...
- Oh.

07:30.377 --> 07:31.780
This has nothing
to do with Robyn.

07:31.913 --> 07:33.617
These are opportunities I've
waited my whole life for, so...

07:33.717 --> 07:35.621
She went back to Wisconsin.
She thinks I'm a monster

07:35.755 --> 07:37.291
who's not looking for love.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.794
She doesn't have the right idea
about me, so there's nothing

07:38.894 --> 07:40.463
- to even process, you know?
- Okay.

07:40.564 --> 07:42.067
Dude, I've been
in the same position

07:42.167 --> 07:43.637
a thousand fucking times.

07:43.737 --> 07:45.273
Like, trust me, I understand,
but for this situation,

07:45.373 --> 07:47.010
you know, it's not that crazy.
It's not.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.981
Is that Drake's guy?

07:49.916 --> 07:52.755
- Shh.
- ELZ: Who else gets you shit
like this, you know?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.959
My guy. I'll talk to you
later, cutie pie.

07:55.093 --> 07:56.128
All right, peace.

07:56.262 --> 07:58.299
What'd he say?

07:58.433 --> 08:00.270
Um...

08:00.403 --> 08:03.409
He's not comfortable
with making the ask.

08:03.409 --> 08:05.246
Not comfortable making the ask?

08:05.347 --> 08:06.650
It's a big ask.

08:06.783 --> 08:08.787
It's not a big ask at all.
He asks Drake,

08:08.787 --> 08:10.891
"Hey, Drake, do you want to do
a session with Lil Dicky?"

08:10.992 --> 08:12.327
Then Drake decides.
It's the easy--

08:12.427 --> 08:13.697
It's, like, a sentence-long ask.

08:13.797 --> 08:14.899
He's just, like, yo,
you're in your lane.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.503
- He's in his lane.
- (toilet flushes)

08:16.603 --> 08:18.072
He pretty much just said
that Drake will never

08:18.072 --> 08:19.174
do a song with Lil Dicky.

08:19.274 --> 08:21.445
Okay, who the fuck is this guy?

08:21.546 --> 08:23.116
I don't understand.
Like, it's not his job

08:23.216 --> 08:24.619
to, like, have an opinion.

08:24.753 --> 08:26.222
Bro, you want to get in
with that fool,

08:26.322 --> 08:27.992
just hit him up direct.

08:28.126 --> 08:29.496
I hit him direct.

08:29.629 --> 08:32.100
I DM'ed him last week,
and he didn't respond.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.537
Well, I mean,

08:33.637 --> 08:35.006
he could've missed it.
I miss DMs all the time.

08:35.106 --> 08:36.643
It said "read."

08:36.643 --> 08:38.312
- Ooh...
- Well...
- DAVE: It said "read,"

08:38.446 --> 08:40.684
but he could've been, like,
drunk and getting, like, head,

08:40.785 --> 08:42.487
or I don't know,
but it said "read."

08:42.588 --> 08:43.624
What'd you say?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.761
All I said was "Hey, man."

08:45.861 --> 08:47.431
- Ugh. Why?
- (Gata laughs)

08:47.431 --> 08:48.767
DAVE:
I kept it so neutral.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.705
"Hey, man" is, like,
the easiest, like,

08:50.805 --> 08:52.274
thing to respond to. Just write
like, "Hello. Hi." Like, it's--

08:52.274 --> 08:54.211
I don't know. I had a whole
longer thing written out.

08:54.311 --> 08:55.681
I chose not to send it 'cause
I didn't want to weird him out.

08:55.781 --> 08:57.350
Soon as you say,
"Hey, man," it just

08:57.350 --> 08:58.386
sound like you
about to ask for something.

08:58.486 --> 09:00.190
It's just so like, "Hey, man."

09:00.290 --> 09:02.495
I knew I should've waited
until he was back in Toronto.

09:02.595 --> 09:05.133
- He's always traveling.
- (whispers): Hey, man.

09:05.133 --> 09:06.837
The most annoying part
of this entire thing is,

09:06.937 --> 09:09.241
I know for a fact,
if I hung out with Drake,

09:09.341 --> 09:10.678
he would absolutely love me.

09:10.678 --> 09:12.247
No doubt in my mind,

09:12.347 --> 09:14.318
whatsoever. I've known this,
like, ever since I've seen

09:14.418 --> 09:16.556
that half-Black,
half-Jewish man,

09:16.656 --> 09:17.859
that we were destined to be,

09:17.992 --> 09:20.130
like, a unit of, like,
power and fun.

09:20.230 --> 09:22.033
- MIKE: Oh, yeah.
- DAVE: But it's all
being blocked by this,

09:22.134 --> 09:24.739
like, gatekeeper
who I'm supposed to care about.

09:24.839 --> 09:26.743
It's, like,
how do I still have, like,

09:26.843 --> 09:28.246
non-believers at this point?

09:28.346 --> 09:29.749
What more do I need to achieve?

09:29.849 --> 09:31.920
Bruh, stop worrying about
Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.524
Nigga, you poppin'
right now, dawg.

09:33.624 --> 09:35.427
You working with movie stars.
Brad Pitt,

09:35.528 --> 09:37.565
Rachel McDonald.
Even me. I'm poppin', too.

09:37.665 --> 09:38.700
Mike, let me tell this nigga.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.504
No, Gata, it's an NDA.

09:40.604 --> 09:41.907
- Can't say anything.
- What's he talking about?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.844
They're making me
the star of Nut Haus, bro.

09:43.944 --> 09:45.681
They're retooling around me.
They bringing more bitches,

09:45.781 --> 09:48.052
extending the shoot, and I got
a ball player contract.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.522
Like, one of them niggas
coming off the bench, bro.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.325
I'm about to go crazy
at the mall.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.595
Like, shut that shit down, dawg.

09:52.695 --> 09:54.298
Like, what you need?
I got you, bro.

09:54.398 --> 09:55.568
Like a iced-out Star of David.

09:55.668 --> 09:57.538
I don't want anything,
but I think they're, like,

09:57.638 --> 09:59.576
milking your shit
in the wrong way, Gata,

09:59.676 --> 10:01.045
and I don't think you should be

10:01.178 --> 10:03.149
the face of Nut-- I mean,
are you okay with this?

10:03.249 --> 10:05.721
Yeah, he's a grown man.
He can choose what he wants.

10:05.821 --> 10:07.290
And I choose the bag.

10:07.424 --> 10:08.426
The whole squad is winning, bro.

10:08.527 --> 10:10.296
Fuck it, let me win.
This nigga winning.

10:10.396 --> 10:12.467
He in love. This nigga Elz is...

10:12.568 --> 10:14.606
doing his thing, dude. Like...

10:14.706 --> 10:15.875
And I'm so glad you gandered up

10:15.975 --> 10:17.377
and faked your death,
too, nigga.

10:17.477 --> 10:18.947
- That was cold.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:19.047 --> 10:21.318
Don't call it that. Why do you
still say it that way?

10:21.418 --> 10:22.387
MIKE:
God, Gata.

10:22.487 --> 10:23.790
Let's just go get a smoothie.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.928
This place reminds me
of the fucking tour bus.

<i>BELLA:
Dave?</i>

12:03.624 --> 12:06.663
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. You left this.</i>

12:06.763 --> 12:09.034
<i>Your hard drive.
In your trailer.</i>

12:09.167 --> 12:10.136
Oh, shit.

12:10.136 --> 12:12.340
All right, hold on,
I'll buzz you in.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.779
(gate buzzes)

12:17.685 --> 12:19.689
- Hi.
- Yeah, you left it

12:19.689 --> 12:21.358
- on your couch.
- I'm an idiot.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.396
Thank you so much.
I was probably so preoccupied.

12:23.530 --> 12:24.699
Oh, it's all good.

12:24.799 --> 12:25.901
- You're the best.
- (Bella chuckles)

12:26.035 --> 12:27.137
Have a great night, okay?

12:27.237 --> 12:28.774
Actually, uh,

12:28.874 --> 12:30.544
can I use your bathroom?

12:30.544 --> 12:31.880
I just have to drive
all the way home

12:31.880 --> 12:34.217
to Rancho Cucamonga,
and I don't want

12:34.217 --> 12:35.921
to piss myself, so...

12:36.055 --> 12:37.558
Oh. I don't want that
either, come on in.

12:37.558 --> 12:38.527
- Cool.
- Yeah.

12:38.527 --> 12:39.696
What did you say that

12:39.796 --> 12:41.198
your name was again? I'm sorry.

12:41.298 --> 12:42.969
It's Bella. No "B."

12:43.069 --> 12:44.706
No "B"?

12:44.706 --> 12:46.776
- How...
- I'm just kidding.

12:46.876 --> 12:49.047
(laughs) Oh.

12:49.047 --> 12:50.584
- Um...
- Uh, the bathroom is,
like, right up here

12:50.684 --> 12:51.786
to the left.

12:51.886 --> 12:53.255
Oh, cool.
Cool house, by the way.

12:53.389 --> 12:54.492
Thank you. Yeah,
it's a nice neighborhood.

12:54.592 --> 12:56.228
Lin-Manuel Manual lives

12:56.328 --> 12:57.965
around...

13:21.579 --> 13:23.482
<i>It's my name. It's
"#RIPLilDicky" that's trending,</i>

13:23.583 --> 13:25.854
<i>not them. I'm gonna have to
deal with all the fallout.</i>

13:25.954 --> 13:27.090
<i>MIKE:
It's already trending,
Dave. Let's just...</i>

13:27.223 --> 13:28.760
<i>What's the difference between</i>

13:28.860 --> 13:30.063
- doing that right now or...
- She filmed this?

13:30.063 --> 13:31.298
<i>DAVE:
Man, you're playing</i>

13:31.432 --> 13:32.702
<i>with fire here doing this.</i>

13:32.802 --> 13:33.770
<i>MIKE:
Why? We didn't do anything.</i>

13:33.904 --> 13:35.306
Thanks for that.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.444
Uh...

13:38.613 --> 13:41.686
Oh, shit. Did you see it?

13:41.786 --> 13:43.957
See what?

13:43.957 --> 13:47.430
My short film? I put it
on your hard drive.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.969
Did you go on my hard drive?

13:50.103 --> 13:52.908
Well, yeah. How else were you
supposed to see my short film?

13:52.908 --> 13:54.277
(chuckles nervously)

13:54.411 --> 13:57.450
Yeah, but did you, like,
go through my shit, or...

13:58.119 --> 14:00.123
This is going to sound crazy...

14:00.123 --> 14:01.559
(laughs)

14:01.659 --> 14:06.335
but I'm pretty special.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.978
Okay.

14:10.978 --> 14:12.347
What do you mean by that?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.451
I'm the female you.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.490
Oh.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.463
I'm a full-blown superstar
right here in your presence.

14:21.331 --> 14:22.333
Cool.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.071
And I know, like, you have

14:24.171 --> 14:26.643
this insane self-belief too,

14:26.743 --> 14:27.778
and that's how you got here.

14:27.778 --> 14:29.247
Yes. Okay, yes.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.686
So, I just... I couldn't
let this opportunity pass me by.

14:31.786 --> 14:33.089
No, I get that.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.694
I respect that mentality.
You got to hustle, so...

14:35.828 --> 14:38.900
Yeah. I went to
Kent State, so...

14:39.000 --> 14:40.269
Golden Eagles.

14:40.369 --> 14:41.506
Ka-kaw.

14:41.606 --> 14:42.842
I was a slut there, though.

14:42.942 --> 14:44.912
Hey, how about
I give you my email.

14:45.012 --> 14:45.914
- Yeah.
- And then you can

14:46.014 --> 14:47.050
correspond with me

14:47.150 --> 14:48.085
whenever you want, and you'll

14:48.185 --> 14:49.321
have access to my thoughts,

14:49.321 --> 14:51.091
and we can go back
and forth and...

14:51.191 --> 14:53.195
Yeah, but you could, like,
not answer my email, though.

14:53.295 --> 14:56.368
Well, I'm telling you
that I'll respond.

14:56.468 --> 14:58.239
I'm sorry. I know,
with the right opportunity

14:58.339 --> 15:00.511
to get to know the real me,
that you would know

15:00.511 --> 15:02.414
that we're on the same level.

15:03.249 --> 15:06.021
You know? And you would
never forget me ever again.

15:06.856 --> 15:08.392
Yeah.

15:08.527 --> 15:09.762
Look, I believe you.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.733
You seem incredibly dynamic
and cool, and...

15:11.833 --> 15:13.202
Yeah.

15:13.302 --> 15:15.406
It's just today has been
such a long day for me,

15:15.541 --> 15:17.377
so...

15:17.477 --> 15:20.617
So... what?

15:22.287 --> 15:24.324
So...

15:24.424 --> 15:25.594
it's time to go.

15:27.765 --> 15:28.600
No.

15:30.604 --> 15:31.906
What do you mean, "no"?

15:32.006 --> 15:35.547
I don't know. No?

15:35.647 --> 15:37.450
(chuckles)

15:38.486 --> 15:40.490
I mean, you're joking?

15:40.591 --> 15:42.260
Why would I joke about that?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.166
'Cause it's an
outlandish thing to do.

15:45.266 --> 15:46.903
I'm serious. We're the same.

15:46.903 --> 15:48.907
I respect and appreciate that,

15:49.007 --> 15:51.078
but I do just think that
we can talk about this...

15:51.078 --> 15:53.249
And I'm saying that
you need the opportunity

15:53.249 --> 15:54.685
to get to know me to understand

15:54.785 --> 15:56.321
the magic that is me.

15:56.421 --> 15:58.727
I know, I'm explaining that
I will give you that opportunity

15:58.827 --> 16:01.265
at a later juncture if we just,
like, properly schedule it.

16:01.398 --> 16:03.837
But why not take advantage
of the opportunity

16:03.937 --> 16:05.507
that we have right now
in this moment?

16:05.607 --> 16:07.711
My schedule's just, like, booked
in advance, and I'm so tired.

16:07.812 --> 16:10.449
It seems like you're doing
absolutely nothing, though.

16:10.551 --> 16:12.353
How could you possibly
make that assumption?

16:12.453 --> 16:14.859
'Cause there's nobody here
and you're just by yourself.

16:14.959 --> 16:15.994
That's when I do my best work.

16:16.094 --> 16:17.798
I don't believe you.

16:17.932 --> 16:20.504
- Well...
- (doorbell rings)

16:22.608 --> 16:24.277
Hold on.

16:25.848 --> 16:28.152
- Holy shit.
<i>- Dave, it's Brad.</i>

16:28.252 --> 16:29.187
- Uh...
- Who is it?

16:29.287 --> 16:30.958
Hey, Brad. Uh, I'll buzz you in.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.126
Just one sec.

16:32.227 --> 16:33.763
- That's Brad fucking Pitt?
- (gate buzzes)

16:33.763 --> 16:34.932
That is Brad fucking Pitt?

16:34.932 --> 16:36.603
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Oh, my God.

16:36.703 --> 16:37.972
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

16:38.105 --> 16:40.142
This... The universe
told me to be here.

16:40.243 --> 16:41.513
- Did it?
- Me and you.

16:41.613 --> 16:43.282
Look, I'm not trying
to be disrespectful.

16:43.282 --> 16:44.150
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I need you to fucking leave.

16:44.251 --> 16:45.419
It's exciting, I get it,

16:45.521 --> 16:46.523
but I've been waiting
my whole life...

16:46.623 --> 16:48.627
(knocking on glass)

16:49.762 --> 16:51.298
Hey.

16:53.469 --> 16:55.172
Hey.

16:55.273 --> 16:57.143
Is this, uh, glass made of wood?

16:57.243 --> 16:58.279
- Uh...
- I'm just fucking with you.

16:58.379 --> 16:59.882
Looks annealed. It's nice.

16:59.982 --> 17:01.151
- Hey, man.
- Yeah, hey.

17:01.151 --> 17:02.453
- Oh, shit.
- I couldn't pass up

17:02.555 --> 17:03.857
the opportunity
to get into the "stu."

17:03.990 --> 17:05.059
DAVE:
Oh, you want to record?

17:05.159 --> 17:06.261
- BRAD: Yeah.
- DAVE: Hell, yeah.

17:06.361 --> 17:08.465
Listen, i... is this a bad time?

17:08.465 --> 17:09.502
No.

17:09.635 --> 17:11.471
- No.
- DAVE: Great time.

17:11.471 --> 17:12.875
Great. Hi, I'm Brad.

17:12.975 --> 17:15.814
Yeah, hi, I'm... I'm Bella.

17:15.914 --> 17:17.685
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't...

17:17.818 --> 17:19.755
You don't remember me?

17:19.855 --> 17:22.327
- Mmm.
- Yeah, we worked on

17:22.460 --> 17:24.064
the "Mr. McAdams"
shoot together.

17:24.164 --> 17:25.567
- I walked you to your trailer...
- Oh, my... Oh, my God.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.103
I'm so sorry. I-I have this

17:27.203 --> 17:29.207
condition, prosopagnosia.

17:29.307 --> 17:31.144
I don't remember
faces very well.

17:31.245 --> 17:32.715
Happens all the time.

17:32.848 --> 17:33.850
I did it to Seal.

17:33.950 --> 17:35.253
I can only imagine.

17:35.353 --> 17:37.090
It's fine, it's just hard
to get remembered

17:37.190 --> 17:38.158
- in this industry.
- Mm.

17:38.259 --> 17:40.497
- So, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

17:40.497 --> 17:43.202
Yeah, it's even harder to talk
about your diseases, like,

17:43.335 --> 17:45.172
publicly like that, so...
And, you know,

17:45.172 --> 17:47.243
he wants to actually
start recording music

17:47.343 --> 17:48.445
- for the first time...
- (gasps)

17:48.546 --> 17:49.782
and I am so honored

17:49.882 --> 17:51.318
to be his shepherd
in this process,

17:51.318 --> 17:52.721
so I can tell you firsthand,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.424
like, when I got into it,
it was hard to record

17:54.525 --> 17:56.596
with, like, extraneous
bodies around and whatnot,

17:56.696 --> 17:57.698
so I think if we could just

17:57.698 --> 17:58.700
have our space, we can finish

17:58.800 --> 17:59.769
what we were talking about

17:59.869 --> 18:01.104
at a later juncture.

18:01.204 --> 18:02.273
Oh, no, I don't want
to run anyone off.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.342
- No, she was...
- Please, please.

18:03.442 --> 18:04.946
The more the merrier. Please.

18:05.046 --> 18:06.214
Let's-let's do this thing.

18:06.348 --> 18:08.452
Like, why not? Yeah.

18:08.553 --> 18:11.258
- We're about to jam.
- (whispers): Shh, just
be fucking normal.

18:12.126 --> 18:13.863
BRAD:
Is that Corten?

18:13.863 --> 18:17.605
Dave, nice archie. Seriously.

18:23.248 --> 18:24.986
(whispering):
Yes!

18:25.119 --> 18:26.656
Whoa. Oh, my God.

18:26.756 --> 18:27.992
Okay.

18:27.992 --> 18:30.731
What am I gonna do? Okay, uh...

18:30.831 --> 18:32.668
Uh, fuck. (laughs)

18:32.668 --> 18:34.337
"What are

18:34.337 --> 18:38.278
Brad Pitt's interests?"

18:39.180 --> 18:41.719
He likes ceramics, too?

18:41.819 --> 18:43.122
Okay.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.663
Okay, I think, like... (mutters)

18:46.663 --> 18:47.665
(typing on phone)

18:47.665 --> 18:49.234
A lot of plaster.

18:49.334 --> 18:51.506
- (phone chimes)
- Okay.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.510
(sighs)

18:53.610 --> 18:55.681
♪ ♪

19:17.156 --> 19:19.260
Yeah, she, just, like,
refuses to leave.

19:19.361 --> 19:20.931
I asked her
and she wouldn't listen.

19:21.031 --> 19:23.737
Hmm. Have you ever dealt with
this situation before, Dave?

19:23.870 --> 19:25.106
- No.
- No?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.377
Have you? Like,
what is this situation?

19:27.477 --> 19:29.949
Um, well, I think
you have a stalker.

19:30.049 --> 19:32.053
Is that what it is?

19:32.153 --> 19:33.556
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know,

19:33.556 --> 19:35.560
- I think she's just, like...
- Oh, no.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.363
...like, like she's, like,
hyper-ambitious, and, like...

19:37.463 --> 19:38.432
No, no.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.269
...was raised weird
or something.

19:40.403 --> 19:41.973
No, she's-she's fanatical,
die-hard, moves out here.

19:42.073 --> 19:43.409
She's just, like,

19:43.543 --> 19:44.912
a bit koo-koo-ka-roo, you know?

19:45.012 --> 19:46.448
She shows up to your work,

19:46.582 --> 19:48.152
now at your house. She wants...
(imitates choking)

19:48.285 --> 19:49.387
DAVE:
That is true.
There's something, like,

19:49.487 --> 19:50.624
- really off about her
- BRAD: Oh, yeah.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.060
She's, like, a little...

19:52.160 --> 19:54.832
Hey, s-s-squirt.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.003
We were talking about...

19:57.103 --> 19:58.740
No, we were... we were riff...

19:58.740 --> 20:00.276
on lyrics.

20:00.409 --> 20:03.516
Aw. Now I just feel bad.

20:03.616 --> 20:05.987
DAVE:
Do you think she heard us
call her a stalker?

20:06.088 --> 20:08.493
(Brad and Dave whispering)

20:12.935 --> 20:14.204
Damn it, I hate when I...

20:14.304 --> 20:15.106
- I know, I know.
- That sucks to...

20:15.106 --> 20:16.809
(chattering indistinctly)

20:16.809 --> 20:18.646
- Whoa.
- What the hell? Hey.

20:18.780 --> 20:19.815
- Whoa.
- No.

20:19.815 --> 20:22.654
DAVE:
Please, stop. Okay?

20:22.654 --> 20:25.761
Um... Stop. Please?

20:26.796 --> 20:28.600
No, no, no, no.

20:31.539 --> 20:32.875
I'm sorry.

20:34.845 --> 20:36.081
That was a mistake.

20:36.181 --> 20:38.787
I'm so sorry.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.624
It's totally not cool.

20:40.624 --> 20:41.993
Wow.

20:42.093 --> 20:43.963
This was a mistake. I'm...

20:44.063 --> 20:46.268
Let's put that behind us, okay?

20:46.268 --> 20:48.305
Yeah, it's okay.

20:48.305 --> 20:50.009
Those things happen.

20:50.109 --> 20:52.413
(coughs)

20:53.148 --> 20:55.854
Let's make some music. Right?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.457
(laughs) Whew.

20:57.558 --> 21:01.966
(scats)

21:02.066 --> 21:03.202
Let's make some music.

21:03.302 --> 21:05.473
Dave, what's your, uh...
What's your, uh,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.711
vocal process here?
You just jump in there cold,

21:07.811 --> 21:10.149
or do you... do you have
some diction exercises?

21:10.249 --> 21:12.086
- (knocks on glass)
- Weak glass.

21:12.186 --> 21:15.059
(whispering):
Her reality is our reality.
Now, do you understand?

21:15.159 --> 21:16.929
BELLA:
You know,

21:17.029 --> 21:19.434
what is your process, D?

21:20.804 --> 21:22.173
It...

21:22.173 --> 21:24.043
I get emails.

21:24.177 --> 21:25.847
(stammers)

21:25.847 --> 21:27.316
Packs of beats.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.389
- Uh-huh.
- And then I think
attitudinally about...

21:30.489 --> 21:32.360
what my attitude is.

21:32.494 --> 21:34.397
- Hmm.
- And then

21:34.498 --> 21:36.268
I'll-I'll smoke weed to...

21:36.368 --> 21:40.176
'cause without it, I'll
have too many inhibitions.

21:40.176 --> 21:44.050
I would love to blaze with you.

21:44.184 --> 21:45.286
You guys should...

21:45.386 --> 21:46.823
Yeah, you should.
You guys should.

21:46.923 --> 21:47.524
We should blaze.

21:47.524 --> 21:49.895
BELLA:
Can we, like,

21:49.995 --> 21:51.566
the three of us?

21:52.366 --> 21:53.368
We'd love your company.

21:53.468 --> 21:55.439
(laughs weakly)

21:56.374 --> 21:58.412
All right, well...

21:58.546 --> 22:00.550
I'll make us a couple of fires.

22:02.086 --> 22:04.758
BELLA:
My dad, my father,

22:04.859 --> 22:06.261
they based the character
of Milhouse,

22:06.361 --> 22:07.998
from The Simpsons, on him.

22:08.131 --> 22:09.434
- Yeah.
- BRAD: No.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.404
He went to high school
with Matt Groening.

22:11.506 --> 22:14.477
That is cool.
That's really cool.

22:14.477 --> 22:16.448
Entertainment value just,
like, pumps through my heart.

22:16.549 --> 22:19.220
- BRAD: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- You know?

22:19.354 --> 22:22.226
So... I'm sorry,
I'm just, like, ruining

22:22.360 --> 22:26.234
these M&M's like the giant
human turd that I am.

22:26.368 --> 22:28.372
- I'm sorry.
- DAVE: It's okay.

22:32.413 --> 22:34.150
You guys aren't, like,
still thinking about the gun,

22:34.150 --> 22:36.556
are you?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.227
Well, I am now.

22:39.327 --> 22:41.398
(laughs)

22:42.834 --> 22:44.304
Don't, don't, don't think
about it.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.840
'Cause, like, don't
feel threatened, okay?

22:45.941 --> 22:48.078
I don't even, like, really
like guns anyway,

22:48.178 --> 22:50.382
so let's just chill out.

22:50.382 --> 22:51.852
Maybe we could come up
with an icebreaker,

22:51.852 --> 22:53.155
like when I used to
work at Panera.

22:53.255 --> 22:55.493
Like, "When you die,

22:55.594 --> 22:57.898
what do you want
to be remembered for?"

22:57.998 --> 22:59.467
Oh, okay.

22:59.568 --> 23:01.672
Give me your phones.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.377
DAVE:
Um...

23:04.477 --> 23:06.081
BRAD:
Yup.

23:06.081 --> 23:07.751
Give me your phones.

23:07.751 --> 23:09.220
Okay.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.557
But I...

23:15.600 --> 23:17.537
What were you saying?

23:17.537 --> 23:20.644
I'm sorry, this is just, like,
a lot for me socially, so...

23:20.744 --> 23:22.514
You know?

23:22.614 --> 23:25.085
Uh, all of us. Uh, Brad?

23:27.524 --> 23:29.227
BRAD:
There you go.

23:29.227 --> 23:31.431
(coughs)

23:33.001 --> 23:34.972
(mouthing)

23:36.876 --> 23:38.011
(mouthing)

23:38.111 --> 23:40.082
(coughing continues)

23:40.182 --> 23:42.086
(mouthing)

23:44.123 --> 23:45.426
(mouthing)

23:45.527 --> 23:47.531
- (Bella continues coughing)
- (mouthing)

23:53.275 --> 23:56.014
Yeah, that cheeba'll
get you, girl. Yup.

23:56.114 --> 23:57.249
(laughs)

23:57.350 --> 23:59.454
(sighs) Where was I?

23:59.588 --> 24:01.291
- Dave. When you die...
- Hmm?

24:01.424 --> 24:03.563
...what do you want
to be remembered for?

24:09.808 --> 24:12.179
My artistic greatness, I guess.

24:12.279 --> 24:13.916
I don't know, I want to,

24:13.916 --> 24:15.587
you know, leave
the mark on the world

24:15.687 --> 24:17.423
that I always thought
I would leave,

24:17.524 --> 24:21.298
and, like, prove everyone
who ever doubted me wrong.

24:21.431 --> 24:24.037
We are literally, like,

24:24.137 --> 24:26.007
the exact same person.

24:26.141 --> 24:27.811
Really?

24:27.944 --> 24:31.151
That's all that's
important to you?

24:31.284 --> 24:32.486
- Me?
- Me?

24:32.587 --> 24:34.290
- (chuckles)
- BRAD: Okay, okay.

24:34.290 --> 24:35.894
(groans)

24:35.994 --> 24:38.065
You both want
to be famous, right?

24:38.165 --> 24:39.635
- I am famous.
- Yes.

24:40.503 --> 24:42.173
I-I can't even
go to the pet store

24:42.306 --> 24:43.609
to buy gerbil food without...

24:43.609 --> 24:45.179
(imitates camera shutter)

24:45.279 --> 24:47.483
And that startles the animals.

24:47.584 --> 24:49.755
- Sure.
- Hmm.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.462
Yeah, and then I realize
I'm just another ape

24:53.462 --> 24:55.332
in the zoo.

24:55.466 --> 24:56.602
Yeah.

24:56.602 --> 24:58.071
Is that what you want to be?

24:58.171 --> 24:59.508
You want to be

24:59.608 --> 25:01.478
a gerbil dressed up like
an ape living in a zoo,

25:01.579 --> 25:04.183
hurling your feces
'cause you're so angry?

25:04.918 --> 25:05.620
Well, actually,

25:05.720 --> 25:07.557
when I was a child,

25:07.657 --> 25:09.828
kids at school would say
I looked like a gerbil.

25:09.828 --> 25:12.400
So I would just, like,
scurry around like...

25:12.501 --> 25:13.636
(chitters)

25:13.636 --> 25:15.840
You know? (chuckles)

25:15.974 --> 25:17.443
I actually just want to,
like, show myself

25:17.544 --> 25:19.581
that I am who I always
thought I was, you know?

25:19.681 --> 25:21.585
And I don't want to live
my life with "what ifs."

25:21.685 --> 25:23.556
That's his motto.

25:25.059 --> 25:27.163
Okay, close your eyes.

25:28.666 --> 25:31.237
All right, okay.
(clears throat)

25:35.847 --> 25:38.653
If you perhaps have big regrets,

25:38.753 --> 25:41.391
because of maybe some

25:41.391 --> 25:45.533
not so savory
choices you've made,

25:45.667 --> 25:48.506
it's... never too late

25:48.506 --> 25:51.579
to change course.

25:52.981 --> 25:54.283
What do you see?

25:56.321 --> 25:58.158
Okay, um...

25:59.060 --> 26:01.197
Why is it, do you think,

26:01.197 --> 26:04.705
they bring out the lobster
before you eat it...

26:06.241 --> 26:07.309
...and make you

26:07.410 --> 26:09.247
look at it face to face?

26:10.449 --> 26:11.552
Hmm?

26:11.652 --> 26:12.687
(phone chimes)

26:12.788 --> 26:14.658
Instacart order's here.
Oh, my God.

26:14.758 --> 26:15.894
The plaster's ready.

26:21.271 --> 26:22.741
(sighs)

26:27.551 --> 26:30.890
(squishing)

26:44.885 --> 26:46.555
BRAD:
Crazy shower, Dave.

26:46.655 --> 26:48.325
A bit... brutal.

26:48.425 --> 26:49.862
Yeah.

26:51.264 --> 26:52.601
BRAD:
See how less dense
the material is

26:52.734 --> 26:54.303
since you didn't stir it?

26:54.437 --> 26:56.007
Yeah, it's a good thing that we

26:56.107 --> 26:57.443
whisked it in that
bathtub over there.

26:57.577 --> 26:58.445
BRAD:
Yeah, you just want to

26:58.579 --> 27:00.215
pat it in. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

27:00.315 --> 27:01.752
What do I do about the feet?

27:01.852 --> 27:03.789
Oh, the feet, yeah.
The trickiest part.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.461
What you want to do is
get down on all fours.

27:06.562 --> 27:07.964
Mm-hmm. Now, gently

27:08.064 --> 27:11.505
knead it between
the toes. Mm-hmm.

27:11.605 --> 27:13.241
That's right.

27:14.410 --> 27:16.281
Mm-hmm.

27:16.281 --> 27:17.918
That's right.

27:17.918 --> 27:20.757
You know, the baker,
he makes the dough,

27:20.757 --> 27:22.828
and he kneads it with loving

27:22.928 --> 27:25.365
and kindness,
and then he puts it,

27:25.465 --> 27:27.102
places it in the oven.

27:27.102 --> 27:31.144
Mm-hmm, and then lets nature
do its thing. The bread rises

27:31.144 --> 27:32.948
to a golden brown...

27:33.048 --> 27:35.520
- (mouthing)
- Mm-hmm, releases an aroma

27:35.653 --> 27:37.489
that we find intoxicating

27:37.591 --> 27:39.393
without ever knowing why.

27:39.495 --> 27:43.301
BELLA:
Your voice is really
calming. Thank you.

27:43.435 --> 27:44.972
- (clatters)
- Achoo!

27:44.972 --> 27:46.140
(gasps)

27:46.140 --> 27:48.445
Sorry, I, uh, just...

27:48.546 --> 27:50.048
I sneezed, so...

27:50.148 --> 27:51.785
(laughs)
It's okay, we're past

27:51.886 --> 27:54.123
the pleasantries.

28:00.035 --> 28:01.539
(shudders)

28:01.639 --> 28:03.509
(mouthing)

28:03.643 --> 28:05.345
BELLA:
Your feet are beautiful.

28:05.345 --> 28:07.383
Nice and strong.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.259
The toes...

28:14.197 --> 28:15.199
Leg work.

28:15.332 --> 28:18.004
Frozen Jack for the <i>Titanic.</i>

28:24.718 --> 28:25.920
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.757
Freeze right there. S-Stop.

28:27.857 --> 28:29.160
I-I will stab... Back up.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.732
I swear to God, I'll do it.
Fuck you. No!

28:31.832 --> 28:34.203
- Uh...
- Hey! Whoa!

28:34.303 --> 28:35.172
(hissing)

28:35.272 --> 28:37.042
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.546
BRAD:
Hey, how do we know
that gun's even loaded?

28:38.679 --> 28:40.617
- (gunshots)
- (screams)

28:40.717 --> 28:42.787
Well, fuck.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.459
(yells fiercely)

28:45.560 --> 28:49.902
(screaming, panting)

28:51.170 --> 28:52.406
Fuck.

28:52.507 --> 28:54.611
All I wanted to do was just
hang out with you guys

28:54.711 --> 28:56.515
and you couldn't let me do that,

28:56.615 --> 28:58.218
could you? No!

28:58.318 --> 28:59.721
God!

29:00.857 --> 29:03.663
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

29:03.763 --> 29:06.467
I can't even trust you guys
to leave you alone.

29:06.568 --> 29:09.106
(panting)

29:15.485 --> 29:17.156
DAVE:
Uh...

29:18.626 --> 29:20.563
Oh, Jesus.

29:20.563 --> 29:22.232
You did this, okay?

29:22.366 --> 29:23.803
Fuck you guys!

29:23.903 --> 29:25.038
First of all,

29:25.138 --> 29:27.409
I've been holding it
this whole time.

29:27.544 --> 29:28.746
Shit.

29:28.879 --> 29:30.717
- BELLA: Look it.
- Look at it?

29:30.817 --> 29:32.554
BELLA: Yeah.

29:32.654 --> 29:34.423
Don't look at me.

29:34.423 --> 29:35.627
Don't look. Brad!

29:35.727 --> 29:36.962
Look away!

29:37.062 --> 29:39.300
- Uh, don't look?
- Stop! You did this.

29:40.503 --> 29:41.572
(Dave groans)

29:41.572 --> 29:43.241
The fucking... Fuck!

29:45.278 --> 29:46.515
Don't! God!

29:47.817 --> 29:48.919
You know what?

29:48.919 --> 29:50.690
You're gonna do whatever I say.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.026
You're gonna call Sony

29:52.126 --> 29:54.798
in order to make
my dreams come true, okay?

29:54.898 --> 29:57.236
Whatever you need at
all times. For sure.

29:57.236 --> 29:59.440
I just want to manage
expectations, you know,

29:59.440 --> 30:00.677
'cause talent drives everything,

30:00.777 --> 30:01.912
which... is...

30:01.912 --> 30:03.148
good for you 'cause

30:03.248 --> 30:05.118
you have talent,
a lot of talent, so...

30:05.920 --> 30:08.425
I see the way
you guys look at me.

30:09.961 --> 30:12.132
- I see it.
- We look at you with admiration.

30:12.266 --> 30:14.103
But what's so good
about you, Dave?

30:14.203 --> 30:16.174
Nothing, nothing!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

30:16.274 --> 30:18.211
What makes you
better than me, David?

30:18.311 --> 30:21.050
Nothing, I fucking suck!
I fully suck, okay?

30:21.150 --> 30:23.021
I'm a piece of shit,
I just lost a girl,

30:23.121 --> 30:24.725
and I think she thinks
I'm a piece of shit,

30:24.825 --> 30:26.060
and I'm scared that she's right.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.534
That sounds like pussy
problems for a little bitch.

30:29.634 --> 30:30.670
- Okay, uh...
- Huh?

30:30.770 --> 30:31.705
I faked my death just to,

30:31.805 --> 30:33.108
like, sell more albums

30:33.108 --> 30:35.112
and be more famous
and successful, okay?

30:35.212 --> 30:36.648
I know you saw the hard drive,

30:36.749 --> 30:38.184
I know that you
saw me talk about it!

30:38.284 --> 30:40.155
Please, blackmail me forever,
I don't care!

30:40.288 --> 30:42.159
I don't care about my career,
I just want to live.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.796
Please, stop.

30:43.896 --> 30:46.234
What? (chuckles)

30:48.973 --> 30:51.144
Good job.
Give me the hard drive.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.085
Give me the hard drive!

30:55.185 --> 30:56.087
(stammers)

30:56.187 --> 30:59.160
- Give me the drive.
- Okay.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.470
Now, we're gonna get

31:04.470 --> 31:06.474
some dirt on you.

31:06.575 --> 31:07.977
Okay?

31:07.977 --> 31:10.248
Do something that'll
get you canceled.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.656
I don't adhere to those
types of social structures,

31:13.656 --> 31:14.658
so I don't really...

31:14.658 --> 31:15.727
Okay.

31:15.827 --> 31:18.164
Okay, I once knew this guy,

31:18.264 --> 31:20.536
a white guy, he said
he grew up in China,

31:20.536 --> 31:22.774
and so he talked like that,

31:22.874 --> 31:25.546
and I would make fun of
the way he talked.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.782
Okay.

31:26.882 --> 31:29.353
What accent did he do, Brad?

31:30.188 --> 31:32.794
You know, like the...
like the... China.

31:32.894 --> 31:33.829
BELLA:
Like-like what?

31:33.929 --> 31:34.865
BRAD:
Like, you know.

31:34.998 --> 31:36.234
Do the accent.

31:36.367 --> 31:37.269
- No.
- Say it.

31:37.369 --> 31:38.906
- He's a white Chinese?
- BRAD: No.

31:39.006 --> 31:40.576
- Now!
- No way.

31:40.676 --> 31:41.845
Do the accent.

31:41.845 --> 31:44.116
(Asian accent):
No!

31:45.686 --> 31:47.122
Was that it?

31:48.391 --> 31:50.295
No.

31:50.395 --> 31:51.598
It was pre-Internet.

31:51.698 --> 31:52.934
(doorbell rings)

31:53.034 --> 31:55.238
<i>GATA:
Yo, LD? You here, bruh?</i>

31:55.372 --> 31:58.111
- It's me. Gata.
- DAVE: Just...

31:58.211 --> 31:59.480
don't... Just don't answer.

31:59.581 --> 32:00.817
- He'll go away.
- BELLA: Shh!

32:00.917 --> 32:02.219
- Oh, shit, I remember the code.
- DAVE: No!

32:02.219 --> 32:03.589
- (gate buzzes)
- No! Fuck!

32:03.589 --> 32:06.562
Shh. Okay, you're gonna shut up,

32:06.662 --> 32:09.568
and if you say a word,
I'm gonna blow his brains out.

32:09.701 --> 32:11.939
Understand?

32:12.039 --> 32:13.642
(door opens)

32:13.742 --> 32:14.443
Yo, LD, what's up?

32:14.544 --> 32:16.214
Oh, shit.

32:16.314 --> 32:19.320
Fight Club.
Get the fuck out of Dodge.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.455
What's up, brother?

32:20.590 --> 32:22.326
I-I call everyone "brother."

32:22.426 --> 32:24.063
Ah, it's all good.
Hey, how you doin'? I'm...

32:24.063 --> 32:25.465
DAVE:
That-That's Bella.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.768
You know Bella. You met her

32:26.768 --> 32:27.971
at the music video shoot.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.473
Yeah, of course I met her.

32:29.574 --> 32:30.776
She's the one that gave me
all the snacks on set.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.312
- Yeah.
- I was just saying

32:32.412 --> 32:33.983
I'm happy to see her still
wiggling out here, bro.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.285
She wanna be just
like you, dawg.

32:35.385 --> 32:36.354
She a real one.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.260
Look at her vibin'.
Come on, dawg.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.164
(Gata sniffing)

32:42.032 --> 32:44.003
What's up with all of
this, though, like?

32:44.103 --> 32:46.107
Why it stink like
a motherfucker in here?

32:46.240 --> 32:48.646
My family friend came by

32:48.746 --> 32:50.750
with her newborn and had

32:50.750 --> 32:53.589
a bit of an emergency.

32:53.689 --> 32:56.060
- (clears throat)
- GATA: You know how babies be.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.999
And I said, like, don't change
the diaper in front of us,

32:59.099 --> 33:00.837
'cause I hate
seeing the baby vagina.

33:00.970 --> 33:02.974
'Cause, like, I don't
want to look at it

33:02.974 --> 33:04.644
and think, like,
"Do I have attraction or not?"

33:04.744 --> 33:06.214
And I never do,
but I hate having

33:06.314 --> 33:07.517
that thought process, but...

33:07.617 --> 33:08.652
What?

33:08.652 --> 33:10.288
It smells like lemongrass to me.

33:10.288 --> 33:12.392
Anyways, where the fuck
are my glasses at, bruh?

33:13.829 --> 33:15.967
The ones on your head?

33:17.670 --> 33:18.939
Ah, shit.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.442
I drove 40 minutes over here

33:20.543 --> 33:21.945
for these motherfuckers,
and they've been on my head

33:22.045 --> 33:23.716
the whole time. That's crazy.

33:23.816 --> 33:25.118
What y'all got
goin' on though, man?

33:25.218 --> 33:27.055
You got the fireplace
burning, this nigga

33:27.155 --> 33:28.157
Brad Pitt up in here.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.228
I just came here to make music.

33:30.328 --> 33:32.466
Stop it. You make music, too?

33:32.567 --> 33:34.370
Aw, you're more amazing
than I thought.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.040
Bruh, I need that verse, bro.
Come on, man.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.476
Let me get 16, bruh.

33:37.476 --> 33:39.714
It won't take that long.
I'll write your shit.

33:42.019 --> 33:43.488
Okay.

33:46.528 --> 33:47.931
GATA: That's what I'm saying,
Bella, you gotta go after

33:47.931 --> 33:49.266
what you want in life
at all costs.

33:49.266 --> 33:50.803
- Yeah.
- You on the right path, though.

33:50.937 --> 33:51.838
Look where you at.
You got LD, Brad Pitt.

33:51.939 --> 33:53.341
Can't nobody tell you shit.

33:53.441 --> 33:55.613
You're right! You're right.
I'm gonna win this.

33:55.613 --> 33:58.652
- I really had to
hear this right now.
- GATA: Hell yeah.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.556
BELLA:
Yeah, this is legendary.

34:00.656 --> 34:02.860
I am legendary.

34:02.961 --> 34:04.731
This is my shit! I'm royalty!

skyrocket. (laughs)

Don't nod visibly.</i>

No. No.

Follow my lead, okay?</i>

34:21.230 --> 34:23.368

<i>- We time this right,</i>

34:23.468 --> 34:25.005

three to one against her.</i>

34:25.138 --> 34:27.577
<i>You copy? Don't nod visibly.</i>

34:27.677 --> 34:30.015
Copy.

34:30.148 --> 34:32.085
- BRAD: Okay.
- But I don't know what you mean.

34:32.185 --> 34:35.191
Like, I don't particularly
want to make this violent.

34:35.325 --> 34:37.362
<i>This is your destiny.
It's your time.</i>

34:37.462 --> 34:39.066
GATA:
This is your legacy.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.703
Like, what you gonna leave
behind for your kids?

34:40.836 --> 34:42.339
You know what I mean?

34:42.439 --> 34:44.009
That's too big of a decision
to let somebody else decide.

34:44.009 --> 34:45.345
Gata's gonna get us killed, man.

34:45.445 --> 34:46.915

the wrong type of shit.

<i>You're gonna have to
roll this bitch.</i>

making any big moves right now.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.778

talk her down if we just...

35:01.878 --> 35:03.181

35:03.281 --> 35:04.517

what have you actually really

35:25.693 --> 35:27.429

35:45.098 --> 35:46.400

35:46.400 --> 35:47.904

42:37.923 --> 42:40.696
- Pop, tell Ava about
your skydiving story.
- Mm-hmm.

42:40.796 --> 42:43.334
Oh, so, I'm-I'm hurtling
towards the Earth,

42:43.467 --> 42:45.706
a-and my, uh, instructor
pulls the rip cord,

42:45.806 --> 42:47.877
- but nothing happens.
- AVA: No...

42:47.977 --> 42:50.481
<i>DAVE:
And honestly, I think,
deep down,</i>

42:50.481 --> 42:52.318
<i>I've just been scared.</i>

42:52.318 --> 42:53.722
Well, no,
tell the Sundance people

42:53.822 --> 42:55.793
Dave is actually now willing
to promote it.

42:55.793 --> 42:57.496
It's really exciting.

42:57.496 --> 42:58.999
<i>DAVE:
Scared to put myself out there.</i>

42:59.132 --> 43:01.604
Uh-huh. I truly can't
believe we are...

43:01.704 --> 43:04.109
<i>DAVE:
Scared of all my doubts.</i>

43:04.209 --> 43:08.350
<i>And I've been looking for love
this entire time</i>

43:08.451 --> 43:11.524
<i>without ever
truly loving myself.</i>

43:11.624 --> 43:13.194
Come on. You got to see this.
What you think?

43:13.294 --> 43:15.431
<i>But the person I love the most
is right in front of me.</i>

43:15.532 --> 43:17.435
- Beautiful.
- How you feel about it?

43:17.536 --> 43:20.274
I think it's gorgeous.

43:20.374 --> 43:22.646
It's yours. This house is yours.

43:22.646 --> 43:24.517
What? Honey!

43:24.517 --> 43:25.886
<i>DAVE:

43:26.019 --> 43:27.590
<i>that until you can
love yourself...</i>

43:27.690 --> 43:31.363
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad.
Um, I got some big news.

43:31.463 --> 43:33.869
Uh, I'm starting
my own record label.

43:33.969 --> 43:36.206
- ...you won't be able
to love anybody else.
- Yeah.

43:36.306 --> 43:38.310
(quietly): Uh, I need to borrow
some more money, though.

43:38.410 --> 43:39.747

(grunts)

44:34.155 --> 44:35.391
Hey.

44:35.391 --> 44:37.428
- Hey, how was your flight?
- It was a little long.

44:37.428 --> 44:38.598
- (sighs)
- Yeah.

44:38.698 --> 44:40.702

Hey, Drake!

44:48.685 --> 44:50.989
What's up?

44:51.123 --> 44:53.360
Thank you for responding
to my DM. I, uh...

44:53.460 --> 44:57.636
I know it was long, but, uh,
shooters shoot, right?

44:57.770 --> 44:59.507
- That's what they say.
- Yeah.

44:59.607 --> 45:01.276
I apologize for the delay
on it, but...

45:01.276 --> 45:04.416
- No. Yeah.
- Happy-happy we could connect,
for sure.

45:05.451 --> 45:07.088
- All right.
- (softly): Yeah.

45:07.088 --> 45:09.459
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- Yes, sir. I got you.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.365
- You don't know how long
I've waited for this.
- (chuckles)

45:12.465 --> 45:13.768
You're here now, though, so...

45:13.768 --> 45:15.137
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

45:15.137 --> 45:16.507
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

45:16.608 --> 45:19.312
I know that my DM probably,
like, sounded crazy and...

45:19.312 --> 45:22.185
my aggression level to getting
here might be far-reaching,

45:22.318 --> 45:27.462
but, like, I really am, like...
I am a superstar.

45:27.563 --> 45:29.800
I am worthy and I am special.

45:29.901 --> 45:31.537
I appreciate that,
but y-- when you say it,

45:31.638 --> 45:33.909
it's almost like you have this,
like, kind of undertone, like,

45:34.009 --> 45:35.879
there's, like,
an auto-tune crying under you.

45:35.979 --> 45:38.551
- Oh. Yeah.
- So, like, just tell me again,

45:38.652 --> 45:41.490
like, you're special, but
without being like, "Eh, eh."

45:41.591 --> 45:44.262
- I'm a star. Yeah.
- Yes. Yeah. Again.

45:44.362 --> 45:46.601
- I'm on your fucking level.
I am.
- (chuckles): Okay.

45:46.701 --> 45:48.672
- (Drake stammers)
- I'm a star!

45:48.672 --> 45:52.546
- I'm a superstar, man. I am.
- Yeah.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.717
- I like that. For real, kid.
- Yeah.

45:54.850 --> 45:56.186
Let's cook. We're-- by the way,

45:56.320 --> 45:58.190
just, like,
super intense first combo.

45:58.290 --> 45:59.727
I was go-- about to ask
if you wanted to eat, but...

45:59.860 --> 46:01.296
- Oh.
- ...obviously we went

46:01.396 --> 46:03.267
straight into
positive affirmations, so...

46:03.367 --> 46:07.241
Any, like, chance you can, like,
teach me how to love myself?

46:07.342 --> 46:10.716
No. That's like a...

46:10.849 --> 46:14.089
Wish we could rewind life.
I didn't ask you that.

46:14.189 --> 46:17.228
But the first time that I, like,
I heard you and I was like,

46:17.228 --> 46:18.097
"I fuck with this shit."

46:18.197 --> 46:19.767
- Like, I fuck with your...
- (exhales)

46:19.867 --> 46:21.036
- I fuck with your shit.
- That means the world.

46:21.136 --> 46:23.073
All I ever needed
was the opportunity.

46:23.207 --> 46:24.944
Yeah, yeah, no, I have a studio.
You want to, like--

46:25.044 --> 46:26.714
I mean, listen,
we can listen to beats,

46:26.814 --> 46:29.152
you can play me some shit,
like, whatever.

46:29.252 --> 46:31.624
I'd love to make some, like,
scorned love, like,

46:31.724 --> 46:33.928
"girl that got away" type shit.

46:34.062 --> 46:36.033
(scoffs) Might have
to extend the trip, then.

46:36.133 --> 46:38.070
- (laughs): Let's go.
- So much time.
