- DVDs.
THEY WERE IN THAT LOCKBOX.

12:24.375 --> 12:28.834
- NO!
NO! NO!

12:28.834 --> 12:34.125
- THEY VIDEOTAPED THEMSELVES
TORTURING THESE WOMEN.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.583
- 13 DISKS.
THEY'RE ALL NUMBERED.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.875
- LUMEN WAS THE LAST VICTIM.
THAT WOULD MAKE HER NUMBER 13.

12:39.875 --> 12:43.083
[man grunting, woman crying]
TURN IT OFF.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.667
DESPITE HAVING
CONSIDERED MYSELF A MONSTER

13:04.667 --> 13:07.500
FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER,

13:07.500 --> 13:09.959
IT STILL COMES AS A SHOCK
WHEN I'M CONFRONTED

13:09.959 --> 13:13.834
WITH THE DEPTH OF EVIL
THAT EXISTS IN THIS WORLD.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.208
- DID THE BLOOD WORK GO OUT?

13:21.208 --> 13:24.083
- AN HOUR AGO.
- AND?

13:24.083 --> 13:25.291
- DEB, THE RESULTS
WON'T COME BACK

13:25.291 --> 13:27.417
FOR AT LEAST A DAY.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.917
- BUT YOU'LL LET ME KNOW?

13:31.417 --> 13:34.959
RIGHT.

13:34.959 --> 13:38.083
I NEED TO TAKE A BREATH,
YOU KNOW?

13:38.083 --> 13:40.125
[exhales] IT'S HARD.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.333
THERE IS SOME SERIOUSLY
FUCKED UP SHIT IN THERE.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.375
- AND IF DEBRA GETS EYES
ON LUMEN'S DVD,

13:44.375 --> 13:45.625
SHE'LL KNOW EVERYTHING.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.458
IT WILL ALL UNRAVEL.

13:47.458 --> 13:51.000
- DEB, COLE HARMON'S EMAILS
AND PHONE RECORDS ARE UP.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.792
YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THEM?
- FUCK YES.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.583
LET'S SEE
WHO HE'S BEEN TALKING TO.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.667
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.417
CHAIN OF CUSTODY.
CHAIN OF CUSTODY.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.166
YOUR SISTER'S NEW MANTRA.

14:21.166 --> 14:24.000
LAST TIME SOMEONE CAME IN HERE,
SHE NEARLY KILLED ME,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.917
WHICH, FRANKLY, WOULD BE BETTER
THAN GOING THROUGH

14:25.917 --> 14:27.875
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DVDs.

14:27.875 --> 14:32.125
EACH ONE,
SAME CREEPY PLACE.

14:32.125 --> 14:36.792
SAME CREEPY SHIT.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.000
NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT THEM?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.083
- THEY ALL LOOK LIKE LUMEN.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.875
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

14:43.875 --> 14:46.625
- WELL, THEY COULD BE SISTERS.

14:46.625 --> 14:50.875
ALL 13 OF THEM.
WHICH IS WEIRD.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.750
I MEAN, 13.
- WHY?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.959
- YOU WERE AT
BOYD FOWLER'S HOUSE

14:55.959 --> 14:58.458
WHEN WE WENT THROUGH IT,
RIGHT?

14:58.458 --> 14:59.750
- YEP.

14:59.750 --> 15:03.041
- REMEMBER THOSE LOCKS
OF HAIR?

15:03.041 --> 15:07.083
THERE WERE 12.
SO THERE SHOULD BE 12 VICTIMS.

15:07.083 --> 15:10.875
BUT THERE ARE 13 DISKS.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.208
- HE'S NEARLY THERE.
YEAH, THAT IS WEIRD.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.834
- WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA, DEX! WHOA!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.291
BACK BACK BACK! DUDE!
- SORRY.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.667
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE
MORE CAREFUL, MAN!

15:21.667 --> 15:23.583
THIS IS ALL WE GOT TO NAIL
THESE FUCKING ASSHOLES,

15:23.583 --> 15:24.583
THIS RIGHT HERE!

15:24.583 --> 15:25.792
- I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.875
- [exhales heavily]
- I'LL JUST--I'LL LEAVE.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.500
- I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET A HANDLE

15:33.500 --> 15:36.041
ON THIS EMILY BIRCH
AND THERE'S NOTHING.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.792
SHE GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL
IN 1992

15:37.792 --> 15:40.083
AND THEN IT'S JUST
A BIG BLANK.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.291
EXCEPT FOR THOSE DUIs
THAT YOU FOUND.

15:42.291 --> 15:46.375
- [exhales]

15:46.375 --> 15:50.041
- WHAT?

15:50.041 --> 15:54.583
- THEY FOUND THIS
IN THE SEARCH AT COLE'S.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.709
[exhales] THE MEN
WHO HURT YOU,

15:56.709 --> 15:59.625
THEY MADE DVDs
OF EVERYTHING THEY DID.

16:03.792 --> 16:08.291
- 13. IS THAT ME?

16:18.750 --> 16:22.000
DID EVERYONE WATCH IT?
- NO.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.542
I MANAGED TO GET IT
OUT OF EVIDENCE IN TIME.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.583
- DID YOU--

16:28.583 --> 16:30.125
DID YOU WATCH IT?

16:30.125 --> 16:32.000
- ONLY ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE
I HAD THE RIGHT ONE.

16:35.250 --> 16:38.375
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO KEEP IT?

16:38.375 --> 16:42.208
- NUMBER 13.

16:42.208 --> 16:47.333
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TO THEM.
[scoffs]

16:47.333 --> 16:52.375
[cries]

16:57.000 --> 16:59.041
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD
FOR YOU TO GET THAT.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.709
I KNOW THAT YOU RISK
YOUR LIFE

17:07.709 --> 17:10.875
EVERY DAY
THAT YOU'RE WITH ME.

17:10.875 --> 17:14.125
YOU'VE BEEN MY ONLY WAY
THROUGH THIS.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.875
- WELL, I GUESS...

17:21.875 --> 17:25.375
WE BOTH MET EACH OTHER
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

17:34.333 --> 17:38.375
[Lumen screaming]

17:38.375 --> 17:44.375
- NO! NO! LET ME OUT OF HERE!
NO! NO! NO!

17:44.375 --> 17:46.542
NO! NO! LET ME GO!

17:46.542 --> 17:51.375
[agonizing screams]

17:51.375 --> 17:55.875
NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE!
NO! NO! NO!

17:55.875 --> 17:57.834
[Lumen screaming]

18:06.500 --> 18:10.417
THE DVDs.
LUMEN WATCHING AT HOME.

18:10.417 --> 18:13.917
DEB WATCHING HERE.

18:13.917 --> 18:17.375
BOTH WANTING SOME SORT
OF RESOLUTION.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.208
BUT I CAN ONLY HELP ONE.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.792
- WATCHING THESE DVDs--
WATCHING IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN--

18:28.792 --> 18:31.500
IS WORSE THAN ANY FUCKING
CRIME SCENE.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.792
WHAT THESE WOMEN WENT THROUGH,

18:33.792 --> 18:35.542
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S A FUCKING BLESSING

18:35.542 --> 18:37.166
THAT THEY'RE DEAD.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.750
NO ONE COULD GO THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

18:38.750 --> 18:43.083
AND HAVE A LIFE AGAIN.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.000
- PEOPLE MAY BE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.166
- BELIEVE ME, ON THIS ONE,
YOU'RE WRONG.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.250
THERE'S NO COMING BACK
FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

19:03.083 --> 19:08.291
- WHERE'S 13?
- DISK 13--IT WAS DAMAGED.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.709
I WAS ACTUALLY GRATEFUL
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH

19:09.709 --> 19:11.083
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.458
- [exhales]
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.125
- YEAH. AND I THINK
IT WAS WORTH IT

19:17.125 --> 19:19.333
'CAUSE I THINK I'M STARTING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.417
I WENT THROUGH COLE HARMON'S
CONTACTS.

19:22.417 --> 19:27.291
AND DO YOU REMEMBER THAT WEIRD
PLASTIC-WRAP MURDER

19:27.291 --> 19:29.083
A FEW WEEKS BACK?

19:29.083 --> 19:31.250
THOSE TWO GUYS
AT THE WAREHOUSE.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.625
- YEAH, ONE OF THEM
WAS A DENTIST.

19:33.625 --> 19:36.667
- A KIDS' DENTIST.
DAN MENDELL.

19:36.667 --> 19:40.333
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
HE AND COLE ARE BUDDIES.

19:40.333 --> 19:43.125
THEY FUCKING POKE EACH OTHER
ON FACEBOOK.

19:43.125 --> 19:46.417
AND YOU SEE THAT RING
ON THE DVD?

19:46.417 --> 19:51.417
IT MATCHES PHOTOS TAKEN
AT THE WAREHOUSE CRIME SCENE.

19:51.417 --> 19:54.750
SO I THINK
HE'S ONE OF THESE GUYS.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.542
SO DAN THE DENTIST IS DEAD.
HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH.

19:57.542 --> 20:00.875
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY ATTACKED
COLE HARMON IN HIS HOUSE.

20:00.875 --> 20:03.291
AND BOYD FOWLER'S
DISAPPEARED.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.166
THIS IS A GROUP OF GUYS
THAT LIKE TO GET TOGETHER

20:05.166 --> 20:08.834
AND THEY LIKE TO DO THIS
FOR FUN.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.875
SO WHAT ELSE DO THEY HAVE
IN COMMON?

20:10.875 --> 20:12.208
THEY'RE ALL MISSING.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.208
THEY'RE NOT ON THE RUN.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.709
NOT ONE OF THEM
BOUGHT A PLANE TICKET,

20:15.709 --> 20:16.875
OR EMPTIED
THEIR BANK ACCOUNT,

20:16.875 --> 20:19.375
OR USED
A FUCKING CREDIT CARD.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.917
SOMEONE IS TAKING
THESE GUYS OUT.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.375
- WHO?

20:24.375 --> 20:28.083
- WELL, AT FIRST I THOUGHT
THEY WERE TURNING ON EACH OTHER.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.792
BUT THEN I THOUGHT
"THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.792
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT
AFTER ALL THIS TIME?"

20:32.792 --> 20:35.542
SO I STARTED ASKING MYSELF,

20:35.542 --> 20:39.250
"WHO WOULD WANT
TO TAKE THESE GUYS OUT?"

20:39.250 --> 20:44.083
AND YOU KNOW THE FIRST PERSON
THAT CAME TO MIND?

20:44.083 --> 20:48.667
ME.
- YOU?

20:48.667 --> 20:50.208
- SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT THESE COCKSUCKERS

20:50.208 --> 20:53.333
HAVE BEEN UP TO
AND WANTS TO GIVE THEM

20:53.333 --> 20:56.583
WHAT THEY DESERVE.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.000
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THERE'S A VIGILANTE OUT THERE?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.625
- YEAH, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT I'M SAYING. YES.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.917
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME.

21:10.917 --> 21:15.041
[Lumen screaming]

21:15.041 --> 21:16.834
IS IT ALSO WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

21:16.834 --> 21:21.208
[Lumen screaming]

21:21.208 --> 21:25.542
THERE WERE 13 OF US
AFTER YOU.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.458
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.083
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
ANYBODY ELSE

21:30.083 --> 21:32.083
UNTIL YOU KNOCKED
ON MY DOOR.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.959
- I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO SURVIVED.

21:34.959 --> 21:39.250
- OH, MY GOD.

21:39.250 --> 21:43.792
- EMILY, I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME

21:43.792 --> 21:46.500
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.083
CAN YOU DO THAT?

21:54.458 --> 21:56.667
- IT WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO

21:56.667 --> 22:01.250
DURING THE SUMMER AT CAMP.

22:01.250 --> 22:06.709
I WAS A C.I.T.,
COUNSELOR IN TRAINING,

22:06.709 --> 22:10.458
A YEAR OLDER THAN THEM.

22:10.458 --> 22:14.625
THEY WERE JUST...

22:14.625 --> 22:18.875
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

22:18.875 --> 22:21.291
EXCEPT JORDAN.

22:21.291 --> 22:24.959
ONLY, HE WASN'T CALLED
JORDAN THEN.

22:24.959 --> 22:29.291
HE WAS EUGENE GREER.

22:29.291 --> 22:33.166
- THAT'S JORDAN CHASE?

22:33.166 --> 22:35.500
- WHEN HE WAS EUGENE GREER.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.041
I FELT SORRY FOR HIM.

22:38.041 --> 22:40.250
BECAME HIS FRIEND,
YOU KNOW.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.000
WE WOULD TAKE THESE WALKS.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.500
AND ONE DAY, WE WERE WALKING
AND I BLACKED OUT.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.000
HE MUST HAVE DRUGGED ME
OR SOMETHING.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.333
- THEY DRUGGED ME TOO.

22:54.333 --> 22:59.083
- I WOKE UP IN A CABIN.
MY CLOTHES WERE OFF.

22:59.083 --> 23:02.375
AND I WAS TIED TO A BUNK.

23:04.875 --> 23:08.041
EUGENE STARTED IN...

23:08.041 --> 23:10.625
- SO HE ATTACKED YOU.

23:10.625 --> 23:15.375
- NO.
EUGENE NEVER TOUCHED ME.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.625
BUT HE GOT THOSE GUYS GOING.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.291
HE TALKED THEM INTO IT.

23:19.291 --> 23:22.750
TOLD THEM
TO SEIZE THEIR DESIRES.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.917
AND--AND...

23:25.917 --> 23:28.208
THEY DID.

23:28.208 --> 23:31.041
AND I WAS WATCHING
GENE'S FACE.

23:31.041 --> 23:34.875
THE LOOK THAT CAME OVER
HIS FACE,

23:34.875 --> 23:37.709
IT WAS JUST A FLASH,

23:37.709 --> 23:43.041
BUT IT'S THE SAME LOOK
HE HAS ALL THE TIME NOW.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.375
AND I GOT DRESSED.

23:45.375 --> 23:48.959
AND THEY MADE ME...

23:48.959 --> 23:51.792
TAKE THEIR PICTURE.

23:51.792 --> 23:56.000

23:56.000 --> 23:59.125

OF HER FATHER.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.792
HE HATED HER FRIENDS.
HE HATED THE WAY SHE DRESSED.

26:05.792 --> 26:07.750
SHE WAS AFRAID
HE WOULD BLAME HER.

26:07.750 --> 26:10.750
- THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON
JORDAN LET HER LIVE.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.041
- LISTENING TO HER TALK,
I COULD JUST SEE IT.

26:13.041 --> 26:14.625
JORDAN'S WHOLE PHILOSOPHY.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.542
TRANSFORMING YOUR LIFE.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.792
IT ALL CAME
FROM DESTROYING HERS.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.667
THAT MOMENT TURNED JORDAN
INTO A MONSTER.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.333
- MY GUESS,
HE ALREADY WAS A MONSTER.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.291
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO GO SEE HER ALONE.

26:27.291 --> 26:28.834
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STAY
IN THE APARTMENT.

26:28.834 --> 26:32.458
- I TRIED. I COULDN'T.
- IT'S NOT SAFE.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.709
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

26:41.333 --> 26:46.875
DID EMILY NAME THE OTHER ONE
IN THE PHOTO?

26:46.875 --> 26:51.917
- YES.

26:51.917 --> 26:53.083
- WHAT?

26:53.083 --> 26:57.208
- I WANT TO BE THE ONE
TO DO THIS.

26:59.458 --> 27:00.625
- IT'S ONE THING TO WATCH IT.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.000
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO ACTUALLY DO IT.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.083
- I KNOW.
- IT WILL CHANGE YOU.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.875
- I'M ALREADY CHANGED.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.000
- WHAT'S THE LAST GUY'S NAME?

27:21.583 --> 27:23.417
- I'M ALEX TILDEN.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

27:23.417 --> 27:26.208
- DETECTIVE QUINN.
MORGAN. METRO HOMICIDE.

27:26.208 --> 27:30.125
- HOMICIDE?
OKAY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:30.125 --> 27:32.417
- WELL, WE'RE INVESTIGATING
A RECENT SERIES OF MURDERS.

27:32.417 --> 27:33.750
YOU MAY HAVE READ ABOUT IT.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.625
A NUMBER OF GIRLS WERE KILLED
AND STORED IN BARRELS.

27:36.625 --> 27:38.041
- YEAH. YEAH, I SAW IT
ON THE NEWS.

27:38.041 --> 27:39.709
IT'S PRETTY SHOCKING.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.500
WHAT DOES IT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

27:41.500 --> 27:44.208
- COLE HARMON IS A SUSPECT
IN OUR CASE.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.500
YOUR NAME TURNED UP
ON A LIST OF ACQUAINTANCES.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.583
WE'RE TALKING TO EVERYONE
ON THE LIST.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.458
- UH, YEAH. WELL, SURE.
YEAH, I KNOW COLE.

27:50.458 --> 27:52.875
- YOU TWO TALK
ON THE PHONE A LOT?

27:52.875 --> 27:55.333
- UH, WE'RE IN A FANTASY
FOOTBALL LEAGUE TOGETHER.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.125
I WAS TRYING TO GET HIM TO
GIVE UP A PLAYER ALL SEASON.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.667
- HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM
LATELY?

27:59.667 --> 28:02.625
- NO, NO.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

28:02.625 --> 28:06.959
- DO YOU KNOW
ANY OF COLE'S FRIENDS?

28:06.959 --> 28:08.834
- DAN MENDELL?
HE'S A KIDS' DENTIST.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.500
- I DON'T HAVE KIDS.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.458
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- NO.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.917
- BOYD FOWLER.
THAT NAME RING A BELL?

28:14.917 --> 28:19.125
- NO. I DON'T KNOW
EITHER OF THOSE MEN.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.834
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.667
THEN, UNLESS I'M IN
SOME SORT OF TROUBLE,

28:24.667 --> 28:25.959
I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.

28:25.959 --> 28:28.625
I HAVE A CLOSING IN 15 MINUTES
I SHOULD PREPARE FOR.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.208
- ONE MORE NAME.
JORDAN CHASE.

28:31.208 --> 28:35.625
- JORDAN CHASE  JORDAN CHASE?
HE'S MESSED UP IN THIS?

28:35.625 --> 28:38.166
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- I NEVER MET HIM.

28:38.166 --> 28:40.792
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO.

28:40.792 --> 28:44.417
- WELL, IF YOU, UH,
DO HEAR FROM COLE,

28:44.417 --> 28:45.667
GIVE US A CALL, OKAY?

28:45.667 --> 28:47.375
- I'LL DO THAT.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.500
- THANK YOU.

28:55.041 --> 28:57.875
- "IF YOU DO HEAR FROM COLE,
GIVE US A CALL"?

28:57.875 --> 28:59.375
MIGHT BE HARD FOR HIM
TO GET CELL RECEPTION

28:59.375 --> 29:01.667
FROM SIX FEET UNDERGROUND.

29:01.667 --> 29:02.959
- YOU REALLY THINK

29:02.959 --> 29:05.875
A VIGILANTE'S KILLING OFF
THESE PEOPLE ONE BY ONE?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.875
- ANYONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT THESE GUYS WERE UP TO

29:07.875 --> 29:10.667
WOULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING
PRETTY EXTREME.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.041
WATCH THE TAPES AGAIN.
YOU'LL GET IT.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.250
- [sighs]

29:18.250 --> 29:19.417
I'M NOT DRESSED RIGHT.

29:19.417 --> 29:22.375
- NO, YOU'RE FINE.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.709
BUT I DID
GET YOU SOMETHING.

29:24.709 --> 29:26.750
- OH.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.625
THEY'RE JUST LIKE YOURS.

29:39.792 --> 29:40.875
- TRY THEM ON.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.750
FROM NOW ON, WE HAVE TO BE
ESPECIALLY CAREFUL

29:56.750 --> 29:58.125
NOT TO LEAVE
ANYTHING BEHIND.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.125
NO FINGERPRINTS,
NO EVIDENCE.

30:00.125 --> 30:03.250
NOTHING THAT POINTS
BACK TO US.

30:03.250 --> 30:04.917
[static]

30:04.917 --> 30:07.166
- YOU SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO GET IT ALL DONE?

30:07.166 --> 30:10.583
- YES, IF WE MOVE NOW.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.041
HIS BANK CLOSES AT 7:00.

30:12.041 --> 30:15.583
WE HAVE TO BE IN AND OUT OF HIS
HOUSE BEFORE HE GETS BACK.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.834
I'M USED TO HUNTING
ON MY OWN.

30:36.834 --> 30:40.834
AND HERE WE ARE,
HUNTING AS A PAIR.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.959
- LOOKS LIKE ALEX
BELIEVES IN KARMA.

30:53.625 --> 30:57.667
- AND IT'S ALL BECOME SO...

30:57.667 --> 30:59.125
NATURAL.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.000
- SHOULD WE TAKE IT?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.709
- NO. HE'LL KNOW
SOMEONE WAS HERE.

31:12.709 --> 31:15.750
THIS IS JUST
A FACT-FINDING MISSION.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.542
- I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT THE FACTS ARE.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.625
- THERE'S A WAY TO DO THIS.

31:20.625 --> 31:23.583
IT PROTECTS YOU.

31:23.583 --> 31:27.041
IT PROTECTS BOTH OF US.

31:30.875 --> 31:32.250
- ONE OF THESE DAYS,

31:32.250 --> 31:35.375
YOU'VE GOT TO TEACH ME
HOW TO DO THAT.

31:41.709 --> 31:45.875
- 13 PIECES OF JEWELRY.
13 TROPHIES.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.667
- MY GRANDPARENTS
GAVE ME THIS

31:51.667 --> 31:54.542
WHEN I GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.583
I WAS WEARING IT
THE NIGHT THEY TOOK ME.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.583
THIS IS MINE.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.709
- LET ME.

32:11.875 --> 32:15.917
- HOW DO YOU CHOOSE THE--
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, THE PLACE?

32:15.917 --> 32:17.959
- KILL ROOM.

32:20.250 --> 32:25.041
WE NEED SOMEPLACE
INCONSPICUOUS AND SECURE.

32:27.792 --> 32:30.375
- LIKE THIS?

32:32.917 --> 32:37.750
- MAYBE IT'S TRUE THAT PAIRS
SURVIVE BETTER IN THE WILD.

32:42.917 --> 32:47.250
- IT'S NOT EASY
TALKING TO A STRANGER.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.750
BUT I DID IT ANYWAY.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.458
FOR YOU.

32:52.458 --> 32:57.542
- YOU TOLD HER EVERYTHING,
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAMP?

32:57.542 --> 33:02.041
- IT WAS HARD, BUT YEAH.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.667
[sighs]

33:03.667 --> 33:07.125
- YOU TOLD HER ABOUT ALEX?

33:07.125 --> 33:09.500
- I TOLD HER THE TRUTH,

33:09.500 --> 33:11.000
LIKE YOU SAID.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.125
EVEN THOUGH
I DIDN'T WANT TO.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.667
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE,
JORDAN?

33:24.333 --> 33:29.125
- THE GIRL YOU TALKED TO
WAS MAKING WAVES.

33:31.417 --> 33:34.500
BUT EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW,

33:34.500 --> 33:36.083
THANKS TO YOU.

33:36.083 --> 33:39.542
- SHE WAS PRETTY.

33:39.542 --> 33:40.959
THE GIRL.

33:40.959 --> 33:44.166
- EMILY.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.250
NO ONE COULD EVER
TAKE YOUR PLACE.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.875
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

33:50.250 --> 33:53.208
WE HAVE A BOND

33:53.208 --> 33:56.125
THAT NO ONE
CAN EVER BREAK.

33:58.375 --> 34:00.792
YOU MADE ME
WHAT I AM TODAY.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.166
DO YOU KNOW HOW SPECIAL
YOU ARE TO ME?

34:40.041 --> 34:42.166
[elevator bell dings]

34:45.500 --> 34:47.667
- EUGENE GREER HAS ARRIVED.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.959
- OH, THE PARADE'S HERE.

34:50.959 --> 34:53.041
- FOUR BODYGUARDS?
THAT'S IT?

34:58.875 --> 35:00.667
- DETECTIVES,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

35:00.667 --> 35:02.583
MY FRIEND AND ATTORNEY,
STUART FRANK.

35:02.583 --> 35:03.917
- HOW DO YOU DO?

35:03.917 --> 35:06.625
YOU'VE REQUESTED A DNA SAMPLE
FROM MY CLIENT.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.083
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.250
- THERE WAS
UNIDENTIFIED MALE DNA

35:10.250 --> 35:11.542
FOUND ON
THE BARREL GIRL VICTIMS.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.041
WE WANT TO CLEAR MR. CHASE
AS A SUSPECT.

35:14.041 --> 35:16.083
- WHY ON EARTH IS HE EVEN
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.792
- BECAUSE THE DNA
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

35:17.792 --> 35:20.083
BELONGS TO MEN DIRECTLY
CONNECTED TO YOUR CLIENT.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.917
COLE HARMON IS
YOUR HEAD OF SECURITY.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.959
BOYD FOWLER IS A DEVOTED FAN.

35:23.959 --> 35:25.917
WE FOUND YOUR BOOKS
AND TAPES IN HIS HOME.

35:25.917 --> 35:28.250
- THAT PROVES
EXACTLY NOTHING.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.542
A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
CONNECTIONS WITH MY CLIENT.

35:30.542 --> 35:33.417
I ASSUME THE TWO MEN
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DRIVE CARS.

35:33.417 --> 35:36.625
ARE YOU GOING TO START
INTERROGATING AUTOMOBILE CEOs?

35:36.625 --> 35:37.792
- DETECTIVE MORGAN,

35:37.792 --> 35:39.500
I'VE HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE
OVER THE YEARS.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.542
MANY OF THEM WERE
BROKEN INDIVIDUALS

35:41.542 --> 35:43.792
GOING THROUGH VERY DIFFICULT
PERIODS IN THEIR LIVES.

35:43.792 --> 35:45.792
- IS THAT WHAT
YOU CALL THIS?

35:45.792 --> 35:46.875
SOMEONE WHO'S GOING THROUGH

35:46.875 --> 35:50.834
"A VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD"
IN THEIR LIFE?

35:50.834 --> 35:53.792
- IF MR. CHASE KNEW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

35:53.792 --> 35:55.458
HE WOULD HAVE
INFORMED THE POLICE.

35:55.458 --> 35:56.667
NOW, UNLESS YOU'RE
WORKING YOUR WAY

35:56.667 --> 35:58.750
TOWARD SOME MORE REASONABLE
LINE OF INQUIRY,

35:58.750 --> 35:59.959
WE'RE DONE HERE.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.083
JORDAN.
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.083
I WANT TO DO ANYTHING I CAN

36:03.083 --> 36:05.250
TO HELP YOU FIND
THE PEOPLE WHO DID THAT.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.166
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MY DNA,
YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.583
- JORDAN.
- IT'S OKAY, STU.

36:09.583 --> 36:12.417
I KNOW IT'S YOUR DUTY
TO BE SUSPICIOUS.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.667
BUT I SWEAR, NO ONE IS
MORE DISTURBED THAN I AM

36:14.667 --> 36:15.709
THAT PEOPLE I'VE HELPED

36:15.709 --> 36:18.500
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.166
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

36:20.166 --> 36:23.291
- IT'S JUST A CHEEK SWAB.
IT WON'T TAKE BUT A SECOND.

36:23.291 --> 36:24.333
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.291
- DEXTER WILL HELP YOU.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.875
- HAVE A SEAT.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.250
- [sighs]

36:53.250 --> 36:55.417
I WAS HOPING WE'D HAVE
A CHANCE TO SPEAK AGAIN.

36:55.417 --> 36:56.834
- WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

36:56.834 --> 36:58.208
- OH, I BEG TO DIFFER.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.709
I THINK WE HAVE
A LOT TO DISCUSS.

36:59.709 --> 37:02.041
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE A CLIENT.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.792
- FORMER.

37:03.792 --> 37:05.667
YOUR PROGRAM
DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.

37:05.667 --> 37:09.417
- REGARDLESS, WHEN I SEE SOMEONE
ON A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PATH,

37:09.417 --> 37:12.625
I CAN'T JUST STAY SILENT.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.208
OFTEN, PEOPLE GET INVOLVED

37:14.208 --> 37:15.542
WITH SOMEONE
WHO IS TOXIC TO THEM.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.709
UNSTABLE AND DANGEROUS.

37:17.709 --> 37:19.208
BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.041
- OPEN.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.208
- YOU'RE JUST NOW PUTTING
YOUR LIFE BACK TOGETHER

37:27.208 --> 37:29.083
AFTER A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

37:29.083 --> 37:33.417
I IMPLORE YOU,
DON'T INVITE ANOTHER ONE.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.792
FOR YOURSELF OR FOR WHAT'S
LEFT OF YOUR FAMILY.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.709
- YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD YOU
DIDN'T TOUCH ANY OF THEM.

37:41.709 --> 37:44.792
- REALLY? WHY IS THAT?

37:44.792 --> 37:46.458
- BECAUSE THIS DNA TEST
WILL CLEAR YOU

37:46.458 --> 37:47.792
AND LEAVE YOU ALL TO ME.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.542
AND TO HER.

37:49.542 --> 37:51.542
YOUR TIME IS UP.

37:54.917 --> 37:58.291
THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE DONE.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.291
- THANK YOU, DEXTER.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.834
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

38:05.834 --> 38:07.750
- AND SOON,
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.542
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.959
- WHAT ELSE DID JORDAN SAY?

38:25.959 --> 38:29.458
- THAT YOU WERE TOXIC

38:29.458 --> 38:31.291
AND DANGEROUS,

38:31.291 --> 38:35.125
AND THAT I WAS ON
A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PATH.

38:35.125 --> 38:38.667
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT.

38:38.667 --> 38:42.875
- HE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE ME DOUBT...

38:42.875 --> 38:45.458
YOU.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.291
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:49.792 --> 38:51.375
- UH...

38:51.375 --> 38:53.917
YOU LOOK...

38:53.917 --> 38:55.917
- I LOOK STUPID, DON'T IT?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.834
- NO, NO, NO.

38:57.834 --> 39:00.458
- YOU CAN TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

39:01.917 --> 39:05.667
- YOU LOOK...

39:05.667 --> 39:06.792
PERFECT.

39:06.792 --> 39:08.500
- REALLY?

39:13.875 --> 39:17.375
LOOK AT THOSE.

39:18.959 --> 39:22.709
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

39:22.709 --> 39:24.500
MAY I?

39:24.500 --> 39:27.208
- SURE.

39:34.709 --> 39:37.458
- [exhales]

39:39.500 --> 39:41.417
- THE OTHER WAY.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.542
- OH.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.709
- JUST...

39:51.709 --> 39:54.333
BE CAREFUL.

40:32.709 --> 40:35.417
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.750
- I'M THINKING MAYBE I SHOULD
LEAVE TOWN FOR A WHILE.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.750
TAKE SOME SICK DAYS,
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

40:41.750 --> 40:42.917
- NO.

40:42.917 --> 40:43.875
THE POLICE COULD COME BACK

40:43.875 --> 40:45.417
WITH MORE QUESTIONS
ABOUT COLE.

40:45.417 --> 40:47.500
IF YOU'RE SUDDENLY GONE,
IT MIGHT LOOK SUSPICIOUS.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.333
- WELL, AT LEAST
I'LL FUCKING BE ALIVE!

40:49.333 --> 40:51.583
- ALEX, YOU NEED
TO CALM DOWN.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.750
I'VE TAKEN STEPS
TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.667
- WHAT STEPS? WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:55.667 --> 40:58.333
- I'M ON TOP OF IT.
- NO, NOT SO FAR, YOU'RE NOT.

40:58.333 --> 41:01.375
- I AM. AND I NEED YOU
TO TRUST ME.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.834
- I DO TRUST YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT.

41:02.834 --> 41:05.000
- GOOD.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.125
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KEEP ACTING

41:07.125 --> 41:08.375
LIKE EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

41:08.375 --> 41:09.792
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LEAVE TOWN.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.125
YOU'RE GONNA MAINTAIN
YOUR REGULAR ROUTINE.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.458
TO THE LETTER.

41:13.458 --> 41:15.959
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

41:15.959 --> 41:17.291
ALEX?

41:17.291 --> 41:19.500
TELL ME YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'VE SAID.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.500
- I UNDERSTAND.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.959
- NOW GO HOME
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

41:24.959 --> 41:28.125
HAVE A VODKA TONIC.
WATCH TV.

41:28.125 --> 41:30.542
I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS I KNOW MORE.

41:30.542 --> 41:34.875
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

41:34.875 --> 41:36.875
- OKAY.

41:36.875 --> 41:38.083
[cell phone beeps]

41:45.166 --> 41:47.625
- RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

41:57.625 --> 42:00.709
[dials phone number]

42:02.375 --> 42:04.667
DETECTIVE MORGAN,
PLEASE?

42:04.667 --> 42:06.166
[line rings]

42:07.375 --> 42:08.375
- MORGAN.

42:08.375 --> 42:11.333
- DETECTIVE,
IT'S JORDAN CHASE.

42:11.333 --> 42:13.000
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.500
- [sighs]

42:14.500 --> 42:16.583
MY LAWYER DOESN'T KNOW
I'M MAKING THIS CALL.

42:16.583 --> 42:17.583
- OKAY.

42:17.583 --> 42:21.500
- BUT THOSE IMAGES
YOU SHOWED ME,

42:21.500 --> 42:24.417
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
GET THEM OUT OF MY HEAD.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.458
THEY'RE VERY DISTURBING.

42:26.458 --> 42:29.125
- THEY ARE.

42:29.125 --> 42:30.834
[snaps fingers]
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

42:30.834 --> 42:33.500
I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF
A FRIEND OF THE POLICE.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.542
- WELL, UH,
THANK YOU, FRIEND.

42:38.542 --> 42:40.875
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

42:40.875 --> 42:46.625
- A STRANGE CALL CAME INTO
MY OFFICE FROM AN ALEX TILDEN.

42:46.625 --> 42:49.625
- ALEX TILDEN CALLED YOU?
WHAT--WHAT DID HE WANT?

42:49.625 --> 42:51.208
- I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM
MYSELF,

42:51.208 --> 42:55.417
BUT MY SECRETARY SAID THAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR COLE HARMON.

42:55.417 --> 42:58.041
SHE SAID
HE SOUNDED PANICKED,

42:58.041 --> 42:59.333
THAT HE WANTED TO
SPEAK TO COLE

42:59.333 --> 43:01.208
ABOUT A FLIGHT
HE NEEDED TO ARRANGE.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.375
- A FLIGHT TO WHERE?

43:02.375 --> 43:04.208
- THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.750
IT'S NOT MUCH, I REALIZE,

43:05.750 --> 43:08.625
BUT I HOPE
IT CAN BE USEFUL.

43:08.625 --> 43:10.458
- THANK YOU, MR. CHASE.

43:10.458 --> 43:12.125
[phone beeps]

43:12.125 --> 43:13.709
[engine starts]

43:17.333 --> 43:18.917
- SADDLE UP.

43:18.917 --> 43:22.208
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR FANTASY
FOOTBALLER'S LEAVING TOWN.

43:26.583 --> 43:28.625
[door opens]

43:30.417 --> 43:32.083
[keys clank on table]

43:32.083 --> 43:34.959
- [laughs]

43:34.959 --> 43:37.166
- NO! NO!
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

43:37.166 --> 43:41.250
NO! NO! NO! NO! STOP!

43:41.250 --> 43:45.458
NO! LET ME GO!
AAH! AAH!

43:45.458 --> 43:46.375
- OH, MY GOD.

43:46.375 --> 43:49.583
[screaming on tape
continues]

43:51.834 --> 43:53.625
- HELP!

44:01.208 --> 44:02.667
[inhales sharply]

44:10.208 --> 44:12.500
- WHO ARE YOU?

44:26.417 --> 44:28.291
WHAT'S THAT?

44:28.291 --> 44:30.000
WHAT--
[groans]

44:33.375 --> 44:35.125
UHH!

44:43.125 --> 44:44.709
- IT'S FOR HER.

44:44.709 --> 44:47.875
- WHO?
- OH, I THINK YOU KNOW.

44:49.166 --> 44:52.458
- UH, I MEAN,
WHAT'S HER NAME?

44:52.458 --> 44:54.458
- OH, NOW YOU WANT TO
KNOW HER NAME?

44:54.458 --> 44:55.792
- [groans]

45:00.750 --> 45:03.750
LOOK, YOU--YOU REALLY
HAVE THIS ALL WRONG.

45:03.750 --> 45:06.250
- SAVE IT FOR HER.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.500
- WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

45:07.500 --> 45:12.083
- ALEX TILDEN, 3040.
THAT'S 3048.

45:12.083 --> 45:13.500
HERE IT IS.

45:15.208 --> 45:16.583
AND HE'S HOME.

45:30.583 --> 45:32.333
[knock on door]

46:24.625 --> 46:28.750
- I LOOK DIFFERENT,
DON'T I?

46:28.750 --> 46:30.750
WITHOUT MY HANDS TIED
BEHIND MY BACK.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.959
BUT YOU RECOGNIZE ME.

46:36.959 --> 46:38.750
I CAN TELL.

46:45.166 --> 46:47.333
- I NE--I NEVER WANTED
TO DO ANY OF IT.

46:47.333 --> 46:49.625
- REALLY?

46:49.625 --> 46:52.250
- IT WASN'T--IT WASN'T ME.

46:52.250 --> 46:53.959
IT WAS--IT WAS JORDAN.

46:53.959 --> 46:56.542
IT'S ALL JORDAN.

46:56.542 --> 46:58.834
HE HAS THIS WAY.

46:58.834 --> 46:59.959
- OF GETTING
INSIDE YOUR HEAD,

46:59.959 --> 47:03.083
GETTING YOU IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR PRIMAL NATURE?

47:03.083 --> 47:04.875
- HE MADE ME DO THINGS
I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE.

47:04.875 --> 47:10.083
- NO, YOU MADE ME DO THINGS
I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE.

47:10.083 --> 47:12.041
EVER.

47:12.041 --> 47:13.250
EVER!

47:15.166 --> 47:17.583
- WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?

47:17.583 --> 47:19.250
I CAN GIVE YOU
JORDAN CHASE.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.792
- WE'VE GOT JORDAN CHASE.

47:21.792 --> 47:23.750
- W-WELL,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

47:23.750 --> 47:25.917
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING.

47:25.917 --> 47:28.208
I MEAN, THAT--THAT--THAT--
THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT US

47:28.208 --> 47:33.083
TO THIS FUCKING UNFORTUNATE
SITUATION, AM I RIGHT?

47:33.083 --> 47:34.834
I'M A BANKER.

47:34.834 --> 47:36.542
I CAN GET MONEY.
LOTS OF IT.

47:36.542 --> 47:37.333
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

47:37.333 --> 47:38.417
SO TELL ME,

47:38.417 --> 47:39.875
WHAT'S THIS GONNA COST?

47:39.875 --> 47:41.625
JUST GIVE ME A NUMBER.

47:45.458 --> 47:48.625
- 13.

47:48.625 --> 47:52.125
- NO. I-I-I--
[muffled shout]

47:52.125 --> 47:55.041
[grunts]

47:58.041 --> 48:00.625
- THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

48:00.625 --> 48:02.917
A FIRST STEP.
A FIRST WORD.

48:02.917 --> 48:06.375
A FIRST KISS.
A FIRST KILL.

48:06.375 --> 48:08.959
SOMEHOW YOU KNOW
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

48:08.959 --> 48:10.667
AIM FOR THE HEART.

48:27.458 --> 48:33.000
- [grunting]

48:37.583 --> 48:38.959
[muffled shout]

48:38.959 --> 48:41.041
[groans]

48:44.250 --> 48:45.583
- [gasps]

48:45.583 --> 48:49.709
[breathing heavily]

48:51.959 --> 48:53.542
- YOU OKAY?

48:55.125 --> 48:57.959
- YES.

48:57.959 --> 48:59.750
- WE SHOULD LOCK DOWN
THE AIRPORTS

48:59.750 --> 49:01.542
IN CASE HE TRIES TO FLEE.

49:01.542 --> 49:04.041
- HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

49:06.959 --> 49:09.750
LOOK AT THIS. LOOKS LIKE
A PARTIAL FOOTPRINT.

49:13.083 --> 49:14.375
- IT LOOKS SMALL.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.583
MAYBE A WOMAN'S.

49:18.208 --> 49:21.083
- AND SHE WAS JUST HERE.

49:23.041 --> 49:26.959
REMEMBER AT BOYD'S HOUSE,
THAT FUCKING HAIR BOOK,

49:26.959 --> 49:28.291
IT HAD 12 PIECES IN IT?

49:28.291 --> 49:31.834
BUT THERE ARE 13 DVDs.

49:31.834 --> 49:34.542
ONE OF THEM DIDN'T
GET THEIR HAIR TAKEN.

49:34.542 --> 49:37.083
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING EXACTLY?

49:37.083 --> 49:40.375
- WELL, WHAT IF ONE OF THEM
ESCAPED SOMEHOW

49:40.375 --> 49:42.750
AND--AND--AFTER EVERYTHING
THEY'D DONE,

49:42.750 --> 49:44.834
THEY'VE COME BACK
TO GET EVEN?

49:44.834 --> 49:47.417
WHAT IF THE VIGILANTE
IS ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS?

49:59.291 --> 50:01.208
[keys clatter]

50:01.208 --> 50:02.500
- HARRY TRIED TO MOLD ME

50:02.500 --> 50:06.333
INTO THE IMAGE OF THE MONSTER
HE THOUGHT I WAS.

50:14.583 --> 50:17.291
HE TOLD ME TO FLEE
HUMAN CONNECTION,

50:17.291 --> 50:19.291
SO THAT BECAME A WAY
OF LIFE FOR ME.

52:36.875 --> 52:42.083
BUT WITH LUMEN...

52:42.083 --> 52:45.166
I'M SOMEONE DIFFERENT.

52:48.291 --> 52:51.166
IN HER EYES...

52:54.792 --> 52:57.625
I'M NOT A MONSTER AT ALL.
