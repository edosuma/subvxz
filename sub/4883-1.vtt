01:58.284 --> 02:01.887
               Hi, Sadie.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.623
Stephen, hurry up. You're
  letting all the cold air in.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.660
Happy you're making yourself
so useful.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.330
You told me to videotape,
   remember?

02:11.332 --> 02:15.501
    Yes, I remember...
    and I regret it already.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.571
        Oh, god. The poles.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.141
     Can you put that down
     and be of some use?

02:22.143 --> 02:24.576
Hey, I'm doing my job.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.881
         Ready to roll.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.549
Oh, why aren't you driving?

02:30.551 --> 02:33.919
Stephen wasn't comfortable with
that.
Oh

02:38.825 --> 02:41.593
You'd think they could at least
de-ice the windshield...

02:41.595 --> 02:44.229
when we rent the vehicle
from them.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.297
     God

02:47.901 --> 02:52.804
 All right, we are on our way.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.675
Hold on.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.746
Okay. Windshield.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.616
It's making it worse.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.192
Mount Ballyhoo? Really?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.761
That's not a native Aleutian
name. They usually begin with A.

03:15.763 --> 03:20.899
Got Aleutian, Alokmok, Alaska.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.437
       Hold on. Hold on.
       Okay. Whoa!

03:25.439 --> 03:27.706
                  Sorry!
I'll navigate.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.277
Ulakta trail will take us
to the wharf.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.682
Ulakta? With a U?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.858
        Oh, my goodness.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.595
You said don't blow the budget.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.766
Captain's very punctual.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.004
    Well, it is archetypal.

04:30.003 --> 04:34.039
<i> GRAFF</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:36.041

04:42.715 --> 04:45.450
All right, Bo. Have fun.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.767
                 On time.

05:01.769 --> 05:06.905
  Uh, what's a sister doing here
  on a crab boat in Alaska?

05:08.007 --> 05:12.678
              Hi, Rick... Sadie.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.547
    I'm Dock.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.083
  The ship's doctor, perfect.
  I am--

05:18.085 --> 05:21.386
Th-- they call me Dock, because
I used to live under one.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.688
   Nickname.
                        Right.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.023
Great, like one
of the seven dwarves.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.592
Yeah... and they call
           him Grumpy.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.930
               Why would this be
               in my locker?

05:31.932 --> 05:35.667
 I wouldn't know. What would a
 cold fish have to do with you?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.737
       You got problem with me,
       you handle it like a man.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.505
           Now, Svet, calm down.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.808
He's begging for an ass kicking.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.745
   If anybody's going to be
   delivering an ass kicking,
   it's gonna be me.

05:46.747 --> 05:50.816
You pull a knife on my ship,
and I'll gut you with it.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.921
Now, if the rest of you are done
with this goddamn tom-fuckery

05:55.923 --> 05:58.657
      Do you kiss my grandmother
      with that mouth?

06:00.493 --> 06:05.130
    Hi. Sadie, what the hell
    are you doing here?

06:05.132 --> 06:08.500
 You know what I thought? You
 were gonna be here next month.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.769
               I sent you texts.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.705
Do I get text
on this doggone thing?

06:13.707 --> 06:17.008
  Pop-Pop, these are my friends,
  Ronelle and Stephen.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.610
               Hello.
        Hi. Hi.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.412
    Guys, this is Captain Graff.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.147
 You know, I was trying to
 explain to my crew about the..

06:22.149 --> 06:25.617
benefits of punctuality. I think
I'll let you brief them instead.

06:25.619 --> 06:31.156
   Well, it's Stephen's project.
You could-- you tell them.

06:31.158 --> 06:35.827
 We're tracking a pod of Beluga
 whales that have been tagged
 with GPS devices.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.430
 They're very sensitive animals
 and the breaking of the ice
 caps...

06:38.432 --> 06:40.465
    has affected their migratory
    patterns.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.034
  What happens to them is an
  indicator of what could happen
  to us.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.970
So, you're getting paid
for this?

06:44.972 --> 06:46.872
       The two of us are working
       on our degrees.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.107
        Stephen's our professor.
   We're funded by NOA, the...

06:49.109 --> 06:51.777
   Look, research grants are
   nothing but white people's
   government cheese.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.112
  Yeah, and something tells me
  that you don't vote...

06:54.114 --> 06:55.614
and you sure as hell
don't pay taxes.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.649
      What?
       Okay, okay, knock it off.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.953
    These people are here to get
    some work done. So are we.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.990
       We crab at night. Can you
       work during the day?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.626
  There's bad weather coming up.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.128
 We'll run into the first string
 around 11:00 tonight.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.599
          G, set them up
          in the old radio room.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.903
        All right! You heard the
        captain. Let's go.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.012
 Well, I guess this is our room.

07:27.014 --> 07:30.949
     Okay, now this, I am
     definitely curious about.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.718
You want to know about this
thing?
Sure.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.088
This is cutting edge. It's a
portable molecular analyzer.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.992
     Place the sample in this
     cartridge and it could tell
     you everything...

07:40.994 --> 07:43.028
      from what species it is...

07:43.030 --> 07:46.898
        and whether or not if it
        has a cold or cancer.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.235
 Hey, Bowman, I wonder if that
 thing can analyze a fart.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.771
Ugh.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.573
   Okay, leave now, cavemen.

07:54.575 --> 07:59.644
 Go wrestle sharks or whatever
 you do.
 All right.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.647
 Wait, I thought you guys were
 just tracking the whales.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.183
  Yeah, but if we can get
  a teeny sample we can see...

08:05.185 --> 08:08.854
how climate change is affecting
their migration pattern as well
as their biology.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.722
  Let's add some visual aids.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.228
      Here we are and here
      are the whales.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.730
         Can you tell if they're
         acting normal?

08:18.732 --> 08:22.267
<i> GRAFF</i>  <i> Sadie to the wheelhouse.
</i>  <i> Sadie to the wheelhouse.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:36.881
                     Hi.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.955
You all settled in?

08:43.957 --> 08:46.591
 It's kinda strange to be back.

08:50.062 --> 08:55.934
   Your mom and dad loved
   the ocean as much as I do.

08:55.936 --> 09:00.972
 We got seawater in our veins,
 you and I. Take the wheel.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.576
I'm gonna try to get some rest.

09:04.578 --> 09:08.580
           Sadie, don't let fear
           hold you down.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.849
They wouldn't want that for you.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.301
Ronelle, wake up!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.706
It could be an old navy buoy.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.009
Let's just check it out and then
we can throw it right back.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.793
                   What is that?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.028
     Don't know, the whales were
     attracted to it.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.798
Whales? Why didn't you wake me?

11:42.368 --> 11:45.270
    Hey! Hey, that thing
    could be a Jap sea mine.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.305
              Here, shoot video.

11:47.307 --> 11:52.711
Sea mine wants to be invisible.
Blinking red light defeats
the purpose, no?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.412
 Any more guesses?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.449
                Maybe Fukushima.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.421
     Lower it!

12:13.899 --> 12:15.366
          What do you think?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.206
    Well, it isn't new ice.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.143
        The older it is,
        the bluer it is.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.747
               What about this,
               satellite, maybe?

12:28.749 --> 12:31.015
  Can we kill the work lights,
  get a spot on this?

12:56.108 --> 13:00.044
  Somewhere in the Bering Sea,
  aboard the crabbing ship
  Harbinger.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.313
 Wait, hold on. Let's cut. Cut.

13:02.315 --> 13:06.184
 We are aboard the crabbing ship
 Harbinger, somewhere in the
 Bering Sea.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.153
           Behind me, a mystery.

13:08.155 --> 13:13.358
    At this point, the contents
    of this ice chunk are frozen
    in mystery.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.994
               The-- back on me.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.496
   The unmistakable blue-ish hue
   you see here...

13:18.498 --> 13:21.399
      tells us it is not
      a new piece of ice.

13:21.401 --> 13:28.072
And here, keep me in the frame,
these rounded edges speak
of melting, not breaking off...

13:28.074 --> 13:30.508
      no doubt caused by climate
      change.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.277
    Whoa!

13:32.279 --> 13:36.181
       There's a palpable sense
       of urgency, excitement...

13:36.183 --> 13:39.918
  and perhaps, yes, trepidation.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.888
Again, this is Dr. Stephen
Lichte aboard the Harbinger.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.090
We'll be checking back
in with you...

13:46.092 --> 13:49.327
 as the mystery reveals itself.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.963
   Great. I think we got it.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.220
       Control panel.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.990
 Some things should stay frozen.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.060
Pop-Pop, look at this.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.365
Is that an animal or something?

14:36.942 --> 14:39.544
            Soviet.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.081
     This thing's been
     frozen since the 80's.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.624
 We're gonna need to turn this
 over to the authorities.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.460
Ah, no... it's property
of the university.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.095
    Bullshit. How do you figure?

14:57.097 --> 14:59.631
Found by a University
representative, so--

14:59.633 --> 15:03.935
It's safe to assume the Russians
are gonna want it back.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.337
Correction. It's from the Soviet
Union, which no longer exists.

15:06.339 --> 15:11.175
He's right, Pop-Pop. Salvage
law, whoever finds it, owns it.

15:11.177 --> 15:15.246
       Okay...
       then it belongs to Sadie.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.549
     And everything on this ship
     is under my control.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.920
 The weather's turning bad.
 We're gonna knock the ice off.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.055
       And put this hunk of junk
       in the hold...

15:24.057 --> 15:26.291
   and nobody's gonna touch it
   until we get in Dutch Harbor.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.426
Uh, hold on a sec.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.496
               Captain's orders.
   This may--

15:31.498 --> 15:34.265
           What part of this
           don't you comprehend?

15:41.941 --> 15:44.442
        Can he do that?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.177
You want me to keep rolling?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.979
           Turn it off!

16:28.420 --> 16:30.688
  Roland, that storm's headed
  our way, pushing ice.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.757
It's probably dragging our pots.

16:32.759 --> 16:36.227
<i> GRAFF</i>
<i> We're gonna wait it out in the</i>
<i> shallows.</i>

17:12.297 --> 17:16.233
Burnt to a crisp.
Man, any way to die, but that.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.436
 All right. We gotta ice these
 crabs. We're gonna be here a
 while.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.643
     Oh, whoa, whoa, hey, man.
     Come on, careful with that.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.778
          You're gonna freeze us
          up into an Eskimo--

17:26.780 --> 17:28.413
          Eskimo pie.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.616
  Yeah, I'm Inuit, by the way,
  asshole.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.285
      Yeah, but Inuit pie
      isn't as funny.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.135
  What the fuck?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.638
     What's wrong with you, man?
     That shit ain't funny!

17:57.142 --> 18:02.113
   Come on! Damn.
   Hey, I got a heart condition.
   You can't be doing that shit.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.481
               That ain't funny.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.450
    You should get to work.

18:09.655 --> 18:12.223
<i> DUTCH HARBOR</i> <i> You're breaking up.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.258
    No mayday, Dutch Harbor.
    Informing you...

18:14.260 --> 18:16.694
  we've dredged a piece of

   Harbinger out. Goddamnit.

19:00.672 --> 19:03.374
Sadie, we need to talk
about our find.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.910
You know, as well as I do,
it is not within...

19:05.912 --> 19:08.513
Pop-Pop's purview to simply
assign ownership.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.882
      Are you guys getting
      any cell service?

19:10.884 --> 19:15.219
  It's the storm. Internet will
  be down, too, until it passes.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.488
                      Thanks.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.828
Look, I'm sure he means well...

19:23.830 --> 19:26.631
but it is not going to look good
for you at the university...

19:26.633 --> 19:31.335
if you countermand my authority
on this expedition. You're my
student.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.273
     So any theories as to what
     brought down your spaceman?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.808
Soviet spacecraft design isn't
exactly my area.

19:37.810 --> 19:42.680
   You know, ownership has not
   technically been established.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.382
          Aren't you curious?

19:44.384 --> 19:47.585
    Her curiosity is irrelevant.

19:47.587 --> 19:51.722
    I'm just saying, if I was
    a scientist, I would be down
there science-ing.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.259
         Science-ing? Good lord!

19:55.261 --> 19:58.429
  You don't just jump into this
  sort of thing hickety-pickety.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.532
Alaska.

20:01.534 --> 20:06.637
      Look, Sadie, I know you're
      excited. Me, too.

20:06.639 --> 20:11.309
And kudos to you for playing a
huge part in finding this thing.

20:11.311 --> 20:15.313
It's gonna be wonderful for your
career, but it's a big deal.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.616
         Okay? And it needs
         to be managed properly.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.319
         And you just don't have
         the experience, kiddo.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.589
That's where I come in, okay?

20:24.591 --> 20:27.491
    And I will look out for you.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.393
      We got it.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.867
                     Okay. Good.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.908
    He's planning to cut you
    out of this.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.778
But if I countermand him--
   The salvage rights are yours.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.984
 If Professor Asswipe wasn't
 here, what would you be doing
 right now?

20:58.357 --> 21:01.492
G, run distraction for a second.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.798
I think we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.267
                      I'm sorry?

21:09.269 --> 21:13.404
Sometimes I... I overcompensate.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.307
It's kinda... I come off strong.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.476
 It's kinda hard for me to talk
 about it.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.545
   We don't have a lot
   of meaningful conversation
   in this job.

21:22.614 --> 21:26.517
   Hey, do you have a second?

21:26.519 --> 21:29.420
                    Sure.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.690
    I get teased a lot
    because of my size.

21:32.692 --> 21:36.060
And I've never talked to anybody
about it, but--

21:36.062 --> 21:37.695
You're a doctor, right?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.830
          Well, yes, but I'm not
          a psychologist.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.703
     Although I have read
     extensively on the subject.

21:45.705 --> 21:50.408
Sure, most of my experience
is theoretical, not practical...

21:50.410 --> 21:53.711
   but I think I could help you.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.867
      Can you read any of these?

22:16.869 --> 22:21.939
Nothing special. Radio, on/off.

22:21.941 --> 22:25.076
 How do you say, retro booster?

22:37.756 --> 22:40.725
         Lunniy Korabl.

22:40.727 --> 22:44.061
   The ship was moon lander.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.596
Are you sure?

22:45.598 --> 22:46.964
               Yeah.

22:46.966 --> 22:50.501
They abandoned their moon
missions in the 70s.

22:50.503 --> 22:54.739
Maybe they made it,
but kept it a secret?

23:21.433 --> 23:23.567
        He didn't burn to death.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.742
    Fortunately, and I know
    we just met...

23:31.744 --> 23:35.713
 I think you're socio-centric,
 which gives you hope.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.916
  I mean, that you can, if you
  sort of face it head on...

23:38.918 --> 23:44.622
        can help that stagnated
        individual get beyond...

23:44.624 --> 23:48.959
       that sort of, I would say
       immature...

23:48.961 --> 23:52.563
stagnation in their development,
cognitive development.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.599
    Of course, it's not your job
    to be anyone's clinician.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.803
You know, I'm not saying you
have to, you know, put on a lab
coat or anything.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.572
     Although I think you'd look
     great in a lab coat.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.941
    I do. Wouldn't he look great
    in a lab coat?

24:03.943 --> 24:07.011
    Extra, extra, extra, extra,
extra, extra, extra large.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.813
Extra.
               Oh, I'm doing it.

24:08.815 --> 24:12.650
I'm teasing you now.
I'm stagnating. I'm sorry, um...

25:09.574 --> 25:11.509
I don't know this word.

25:11.511 --> 25:15.746
Translates to "water-bear"?

25:19.818 --> 25:21.685
                  Let's go.

25:21.687 --> 25:25.089
Don't you want to check this--
           I've got what I need.

25:25.091 --> 25:29.860
    I would also suggest looking
    into some books on tape.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.030
                   I have some--

25:33.032 --> 25:36.100
  You know, drinking isn't gonna
  make the pain go away.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.835
 Get out. I hope you're wrong.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.904
           Big G, you might want
           to slow down.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.873
 You know, every time you call
 him Big G, you point out his
 size.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.708
          Are you aware of that?

25:44.710 --> 25:48.045
      This is a sensitive fellow
      trapped in a giant's body.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.914
   Oh, I'm trapped all right.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.649
He's so sensitive.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.955
           You're not interested
           in Piaget at all?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.990
Not unless it's a brand
of vodka.

26:04.729 --> 26:08.866
 The two of you? Classic Piaget
 Stage two behavior.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.067
 You're right, there. Classic.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.002
      How about Stage one?

26:33.758 --> 26:36.193
          So how's our spaceman?

26:36.195 --> 26:37.861
  Still dead.

26:39.631 --> 26:42.766
          Wait. What do you call
          a frozen Communist?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.803
           Hammer and pop-sicle.

26:52.210 --> 26:56.013
It looks like he died yesterday.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.949
As torn up as that
  craft is, how is the corpse
  in such good shape?

26:58.951 --> 27:02.620
Could have suffered massive
internal trauma for all we know.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.623
   Right now, I'm interested
   in the smaller picture.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.058
If anyone can figure it
out, it's you.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.694
                  Hmm.

27:10.696 --> 27:14.832
For a big man,
you can't hold your vodka.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.868
               Sounds like a--
               like a challenge.

27:17.870 --> 27:21.705
No challenge. A Russian woman
can out drink any man.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.340
Are you all the way from Russia?

27:23.342 --> 27:27.378
All the way? It's right there.
I can see Alaska from my house.

27:27.380 --> 27:30.748
I think I have a file on this.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.916
       It's a tardigrade.

27:32.918 --> 27:36.153
Also known as a "water bear".

27:36.155 --> 27:39.690
So what do you think the Soviets
were doing with them?

27:39.692 --> 27:41.692
God only knows.

27:58.743 --> 28:03.013
Goddamnit. So this is how we're
gonna play, huh?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.452
Oh, my god!

28:41.454 --> 28:45.956
What is that?
Are those tardigrades?

28:45.958 --> 28:48.225
    His body must be riddled
    with them.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.395
I should have an advantage here.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.933
            Size doesn't matter.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.169
Guys usually love to hear that,
but from you, it's a threat.

28:59.171 --> 29:03.774
       Do I threaten you, Big G?

29:03.776 --> 29:08.378
  You really wanna throw down
  that gauntlet?

29:09.881 --> 29:13.217
 I'm always ready to throw down.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.785
           Come on!
           I can't fight a girl.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.497
 Are we talking about a health
 risk here?

31:07.499 --> 31:09.900
There's no indication that
they're still alive.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.269
I see decomposition
and no motility.

31:12.271 --> 31:16.039
   They're rotting? That doesn't
   make me feel any better.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.626
   You know he likes you, right?

31:35.628 --> 31:38.295
   Well, that's his business.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.071
     You know about makeup?

31:48.073 --> 31:53.210
If that thing's toxic,
two tons of crab gone to waste.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.279
We'll head back to Dutch as soon
as the weather breaks.

31:55.281 --> 31:59.116
 That's the first order you've
 given that makes sense.

31:59.118 --> 32:02.019
   You're a guest on my ship,
   I'm gonna be polite.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.421
     Get the hell out of my
     wheelhouse.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.190
   Certainly. But consider this.

32:07.192 --> 32:10.627
 Instead of leaving sealed human
 remains inside of a pressure
 suit...

32:10.629 --> 32:13.530
      she chose to expose us all
      to who knows what kind
      of biohazard.

32:13.532 --> 32:17.301
And this right here is going to
be very helpful in the
lawsuit...

32:17.303 --> 32:19.136
I'm recommending the university
bring against you...

32:19.138 --> 32:21.338
             for encouraging her
             recklessness.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.440
            Really?
                    Yes.

32:23.442 --> 32:29.613
        Or we can stop with this
        nonsense, Sadie.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.215
           Sign over all claim
           to this find to me...

32:32.217 --> 32:34.351
      and I will make sure the
      university doesn't hear...

32:34.353 --> 32:35.652
 about your little indiscretion.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.220
Do you know where you are?

32:37.222 --> 32:39.323
        You really want to fight
        against the university?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.992
     We have more money than the
     Vatican and almost as many
     lawyers.

32:41.994 --> 32:46.530
It's not worth it.
I'll sign your release.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.299
             That's a good girl.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.469
      See how smart an education
      makes you?

32:52.471 --> 32:56.206
  Now can we please wrap up my
  find for safekeeping?

33:01.012 --> 33:04.982
How does whale scientist know
 how to do makeup?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.317
            Before I was a whale
            scientist...

33:07.319 --> 33:10.620
           I was going to school
           to study makeup. See?

33:10.622 --> 33:16.159
Cinema Makeup School.
Only in America.

33:16.161 --> 33:20.263
     Can I ask how you got this?

33:20.265 --> 33:22.165
         Bad break up.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.168
         Oh, my god.
         Did they catch the guy?

33:25.170 --> 33:30.474
      They found him...
      most of him anyway.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.676
    We need to get this
    as airtight as possible.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.379
 Tape over the seams. Medically
 seal this thing inside.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.547
        Do it right.
                 Is this a joke?

33:37.549 --> 33:40.017
                         What?
       Take a look.

33:41.185 --> 33:45.489
      What? Who the hell--

33:48.459 --> 33:50.794
      Where-- where is he?
      What did you--

33:50.796 --> 33:54.064
     What'd you do with it,
     Sadie?
                   Nothing.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.198
What, did you throw him
overboard?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.234
        No, why would I throw it
        overboard?

33:57.236 --> 34:00.270
If you can't have the credit,
no one can. Is that it?

34:00.272 --> 34:02.639
        That's bullshit.
   You think she carried a man's
   corpse up those stairs?

34:02.641 --> 34:06.076
Maybe you helped her. You're the
brawns, she's the brains.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.645
You conniving bitch!

34:08.647 --> 34:10.580
        Have you lost your mind?

34:10.581 --> 34:12.449
     Get your hands off me!

34:12.451 --> 34:15.552
 If she said she didn't move it,
 she didn't move it.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.187
                Maybe he did it.

34:17.188 --> 34:21.824
Maybe he got up and walked away
by himself. Fuck you!

34:21.827 --> 34:24.494
      You throw one more tantrum
      and I'll bite your goddamn
      nose off.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.098
                   Got that?

34:50.321 --> 34:54.591
  All hands, front and center.
  Now. Now.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.659
                 Listen up.

34:57.795 --> 35:01.498
             Where's Svet?

35:01.500 --> 35:05.402
Listen, we got a little problem.
That body we found in the
wreckage, it's gone.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.270
      Gone?

35:07.272 --> 35:09.406
 Now, I don't know if anybody's
 trying to be funny--

35:09.408 --> 35:11.641
   Whoa, whoa, why you gonna
   look at me?

35:11.643 --> 35:13.376
   I'm not gonna be touching
   some dead Commie.

35:13.378 --> 35:14.811
  Why don't you go ask Roland?

35:14.813 --> 35:17.147
       Probably gets lonely down
       in that engine room.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.316
    That's a creepy ass dude
    if you ask me.
I'm not accusing anyone.

35:19.318 --> 35:22.586
Yes, you are, Graff. You're
always accusing me of something!

35:22.588 --> 35:24.554
        I'm not accusing anyone!

35:29.260 --> 35:32.863
  Stephen, what are you doing?

35:35.900 --> 35:37.868
   Are you okay?

35:37.870 --> 35:40.270
                  Can't breathe.

35:40.272 --> 35:43.306
  Come on. Come on, let's get
  you inside.

35:45.409 --> 35:48.311
   Okay, I'm gonna get help.
   Hang tight.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.853
       Stephen's sick.
       He won't come in.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.488
                           What?

36:05.229 --> 36:09.432
      Stephen, calm down!
      Calm down!

36:10.268 --> 36:12.235
            Help me!

36:17.441 --> 36:19.709
      Take him. Let's go.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.287
     Atka, get the med kit!

36:30.289 --> 36:32.355
Ronelle, wet rag!

36:32.357 --> 36:33.690
Okay, I got it!

36:37.228 --> 36:38.461
                Let's go.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.600
  Let's go, he's burning!

36:45.903 --> 36:47.737
                Oh, my god!

36:47.739 --> 36:49.339
                       Oh, god!

38:04.482 --> 38:05.915
What the hell just happened?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.784
This is because of our spaceman?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.987
Way to go, genius. Way to put
on that thinking cap. Way to go.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.656
   Of course, it's our spaceman.
   What do you think?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.057
       Man, what is it with you?
       It's a question.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.293
           All right, all right,
           calm down, calm down.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.961
           She's gonna tell us
           what we need to know.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.330
           You're gonna tell us,
           Sadie, right?

38:20.332 --> 38:25.035
There seems to be... an organism
on this ship.

38:25.037 --> 38:28.571
No shit, considering we were all
in its goddamn splash zone.

38:28.573 --> 38:31.408
How did it do that to Stephen?

38:34.045 --> 38:36.046
               I don't know.

38:41.786 --> 38:45.789
     There's some parasites that
     produce chemicals...

38:45.791 --> 38:49.759
         that liquefy the bodies
         of their hosts.

38:49.761 --> 38:55.465
Aipaloovik...
Devourer of Sailors.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.702
 I knew this was gonna go bad...

38:58.704 --> 39:00.637
    but you just had to bring it
    on board, didn't you?

39:00.639 --> 39:03.840
    I put this on you... you and
    this voodoo bullshit!

39:03.842 --> 39:06.543
Back off, Dock! You thought
it was a Japanese sea mine!

39:06.545 --> 39:10.113
       Right now, I wish it was!
 I don't know!

39:10.115 --> 39:12.582
I don't know what it is...

39:12.584 --> 39:16.653
but I know that it went
from the dead pilot to Stephen.

39:16.655 --> 39:22.992
And the answer to the question
that nobody wants to ask...

39:22.994 --> 39:24.627
            is yes.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.765
      We've all been exposed.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.706
    Some of us more than others.

39:39.077 --> 39:44.080
       Fuck you... I'm clean.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.450
We all saw that thing glob
together and go down the drain.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.686
All right, we've been exposed.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.689
    Anything that happens
    to the rest of you is on me.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.958
 We're heading for Dutch Harbor.
 Screw the weather.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.027
         We'll be quarantined,
         but at least we'll have
         medical attention.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.796
     I need to run some tests.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.131
           Yeah.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.032
I want to stick with Sadie.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.035
         The liquid nitrogen's
         all we got as a weapon.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.904
   I want you here on that hose.

40:10.674 --> 40:13.009
Atka. Atka!

40:13.011 --> 40:17.080
      We gotta get those engines
      started. We'll go check
      on Roland.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.162
      Let's heat them up.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.704
It's still alive.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.840
      Ugly little fuckers.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.678
Why do they need to generate
  that much heat?

40:48.680 --> 40:52.749
 Maybe first order of business
 is to kill the brain
 of the host.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.918
Let's see if they have
          a threat response.

41:01.225 --> 41:05.462
Link and they become a solid.
Unlink and they act as a liquid.

41:05.464 --> 41:09.499
That kind of energy requires
a food source.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.468
        You talking about us?

41:17.008 --> 41:19.609
Roland?

41:53.711 --> 41:56.212
            Roland?

42:11.996 --> 42:14.797
                Atka.

42:19.837 --> 42:23.673
 What the hell could bend steel
 like that?

42:25.210 --> 42:27.243
What's all that mean?

42:27.245 --> 42:29.312
It's showing the DNA
   of more than one species.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.813
          The test is no good?

42:30.815 --> 42:33.650
Seawater carries the DNA
of everything...

42:33.652 --> 42:36.586
that lives and dies
in it, from bacteria on up.

42:36.588 --> 42:39.923
  These things have been basking
  in a DNA soup for who knows
  how long.

42:39.925 --> 42:42.592
They've absorbed the genetic
codes of hundreds of species.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.594
    If they can be a liquid
    or a solid...

42:44.596 --> 42:48.798
   they can replace the host's
   blood, muscles, its skeleton.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.000
And even reprogram its DNA.

43:49.827 --> 43:51.894
         You have guts to freeze
         any one of us?

43:52.963 --> 43:56.766
Yeah... I guess I do.

43:56.768 --> 44:00.336
      Then why don't you have
      your hands on that nozzle?

44:09.079 --> 44:11.280
       No one's freezing my ass.
       I can tell you that much.

44:39.777 --> 44:42.679
We're gonna need a bigger
bucket.

44:53.424 --> 44:58.027
       That thing was big enough
       to overpower Atka.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.931
       And strong enough to bend
       that drive shaft.

45:01.933 --> 45:04.300
 That means we're going nowhere!

45:04.302 --> 45:07.236
          If it got Atka,
          it's gonna get bigger.

45:07.238 --> 45:10.473
 It can change shape from liquid
 to solid and back again.

45:10.475 --> 45:13.009
       It can take whatever form
       it wants.

45:14.778 --> 45:18.047
      We'd better ice that thing
      before it realizes...

45:18.049 --> 45:21.784
   that a lot of these bulkheads
   are not water tight.

45:23.287 --> 45:26.789
   How smart do you think it is?

45:33.497 --> 45:35.898
     Pretty fuckin' smart.

45:38.136 --> 45:41.270
       Battery back up will only
       last a couple of hours.

45:41.272 --> 45:44.207
        The wheelhouse is on
        it's own private source.

45:44.209 --> 45:49.912
 If they killed the power,
 it's still in the engine room.
 It's where the generator is.

45:49.914 --> 45:52.749
        Okay, we need to upgrade
        this bucket system.

45:55.052 --> 45:57.920
    Liquid nitrogen
    in a pressurized scuba tank.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.924
  Tubes, trigger, pretty simple.

46:06.196 --> 46:07.530
Is it safe to operate?

46:07.532 --> 46:09.799
   I'll get back to you on that.

46:32.557 --> 46:35.825
 Wait, wait, wait, wait! Stop.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.265
     Ready. Go!

47:37.322 --> 47:41.591
Hold off, hold off! We got it.

47:54.538 --> 47:57.139
Help! Help! She's gone crazy!

47:57.141 --> 47:59.208
       Help! Help! Help, guys!

47:59.210 --> 48:02.311
        I don't know what to do!
        I tried to stop her!

48:02.313 --> 48:04.313
    What the hell are you doing,
    Svet?

48:04.315 --> 48:05.948
      He's infected.

48:05.950 --> 48:08.451
    No, I'm not, goddamnit!
    She hates me.

48:08.453 --> 48:10.353
What makes you sure
             he's infected?

48:10.355 --> 48:12.889
       He's sweating.
Of course, I was sweating!

48:12.891 --> 48:15.324
This bitch freaks me out!
Please, Big G.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.159
This isn't gonna happen, Svet.

48:17.161 --> 48:19.528
       He's infected!
       He's a risk to all of us.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.297
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:21.299 --> 48:22.965
You don't know that
about any of us.

48:22.967 --> 48:26.669
 Please, Graff. Please!

48:26.671 --> 48:30.106
      I'm sorry, G.
      I know he was your friend.

48:31.275 --> 48:35.244
      I got the knife! I got it.
                Hey! Hey!

49:03.473 --> 49:05.374
  Everybody back in the hole.

49:12.282 --> 49:14.317
Did it have to be fire?

49:17.321 --> 49:21.324
Freeze melts. Fire is forever.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.556
What are you really here for?

50:02.733 --> 50:04.633
                  No answer?

50:06.370 --> 50:08.738
         Explain this.

50:08.740 --> 50:11.607
 That's some pretty fancy gack
 for a crabbing trip.

50:27.057 --> 50:30.292
      This is military
      communications gear.

50:30.294 --> 50:32.528
  What are you doing with it?

50:34.598 --> 50:39.668
What the hell...
this is almost over with anyway.

50:42.706 --> 50:47.076
    You're right, Captain.
    I'm not here for crabs.

50:47.078 --> 50:50.212
    She's here for the wreckage.
 What?

50:50.214 --> 50:52.782
        You're a Russian agent?

50:54.484 --> 50:58.587
     Sounds so... Cold War.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.725
We're called "consultants" now.

51:04.327 --> 51:07.329
This Lunar Lander was lost
in 1982.

51:07.331 --> 51:12.101
    Since we got signal,
    consultants...

51:12.103 --> 51:15.071
 have been posing as fishermen
 on trawlers.

51:15.073 --> 51:18.741
Why the subterfuge? Why not just
let the Russian Navy pick it up?

51:21.411 --> 51:24.213
    We deserve some answers.

51:24.215 --> 51:29.385
   Soviets tried to create
   cosmonaut resistant to the
   radiation.

51:29.387 --> 51:31.153
    Didn't work out so well.

51:31.155 --> 51:32.721
                No shit.

51:32.723 --> 51:35.357
Rather than risk entire crew
of naval vessel...

51:35.359 --> 51:38.594
I am here to observe and advise.

51:38.596 --> 51:41.630
But we've contained it, right?

51:41.632 --> 51:45.634
I mean, all we have to do
is stay here until the storm
clears...

51:45.636 --> 51:50.673
   and you call your ship and
   they'll come get their
   experiment back, right?

51:50.675 --> 51:53.476
        They don't want it back,
        do they, Svet?

51:53.478 --> 51:55.878
    Let some small, unsuspecting
    fishing boat pick it up...

51:55.880 --> 51:58.681
    and find out just how deadly
    this organism is.

51:58.683 --> 52:01.550
    I think we all agree...

52:01.552 --> 52:03.819
     this disease can never
     reach shore.

52:05.889 --> 52:08.424
    You could have told us.

52:08.426 --> 52:11.460
        We could have thrown
        that thing back!

52:12.829 --> 52:15.197
That was not the plan.

52:17.601 --> 52:19.502
         So what's the plan now?

52:19.504 --> 52:23.506
In 30 minutes, the submarine
that's been tracking us...

52:23.508 --> 52:26.342
will surface and pick me up.

52:32.382 --> 52:34.817
    30 minutes after that...

52:34.819 --> 52:37.753
    the explosives I planted
    detonate.

52:39.389 --> 52:43.726
   Nobody deep sixes my ship.

52:43.728 --> 52:47.396
  I should have broken your neck
  when I had the chance.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.865
But you're a gentleman.

52:49.867 --> 52:52.701
Not enough gentlemen
in the world.

53:06.449 --> 53:07.917
       So these are our options?

53:07.919 --> 53:11.620
    Death by drowning, death by
    Russian or death by monster?

53:11.622 --> 53:14.790
    Keep talking, I give you
    one of them now.

53:21.498 --> 53:23.766
   Pop-Pop, I'm so sorry.

53:23.768 --> 53:25.935
I asked you to haul
this thing aboard.

53:25.937 --> 53:27.903
              No, no, don't.

53:27.905 --> 53:32.308
   I was as curious as you were.

53:35.312 --> 53:37.446
What's Grandma gonna do?

53:37.448 --> 53:41.650
She already lost her son.

53:41.652 --> 53:45.554
      Sadie, I hope you can find
      in your heart someday
      to forgive me...

53:45.556 --> 53:48.657
            for not telling you.

53:48.659 --> 53:55.264
 She's passed, 3 months, 5 days.

53:58.935 --> 54:01.604
           What? How?

54:01.606 --> 54:04.273
              Pancreatic cancer.

54:04.275 --> 54:05.808
             She was really sick
             for a long time.

54:05.810 --> 54:09.011
     When she got the diagnosis,
     she went really fast.

54:09.013 --> 54:11.513
    Why didn't you tell me?

54:11.515 --> 54:14.316
              She didn't want me
              to tell anyone.

54:14.318 --> 54:15.884
       She didn't want the fuss.

54:15.886 --> 54:19.255
     She was so exhausted,
     she couldn't worry about...

54:19.257 --> 54:24.260
    making sure that people knew
    what was happening were okay
    with it.

54:25.662 --> 54:28.797
         Time just slipped away.

54:28.799 --> 54:31.834
         Every time I go to sea,
         I bring her ashes.

54:31.836 --> 54:35.871
           And I just can't bear
           to scatter them.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.777
             Sweetheart...

54:41.779 --> 54:44.446
            I'm so sorry.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.813
   How can you be sure that
   that sub is really coming?

55:17.815 --> 55:21.083
Spare me your silly mind games,
Captain.

55:21.085 --> 55:25.354
They need my report.
That's why they inoculated me.

55:25.356 --> 55:28.724
            Well, that's great!
            We'll all get shots.

55:28.726 --> 55:33.662
    Shut up!
    This a very rare drug.

55:33.664 --> 55:37.733
And there's a difference between
inoculation and antidote.

55:48.878 --> 55:51.347
   What if we just rush you.

55:58.755 --> 56:01.590
You might get one or two of us.

56:04.027 --> 56:06.795
     Good chance we'll get
     you, though.

56:08.898 --> 56:11.033
What do you think?

56:19.743 --> 56:23.379
     Oh, the gun! The gun!
     The gun!

56:23.381 --> 56:24.780
     Take it!

56:46.703 --> 56:48.771
Not such a gentleman after all.

56:48.773 --> 56:50.806
Tell us where those charges are!

56:50.808 --> 56:54.643
 Okay, okay. You be reasonable,
 I be reasonable.

56:54.645 --> 56:56.078
Where the fuck are they?

56:56.080 --> 56:59.181
      Two are in engine room.
      Then the--

57:43.726 --> 57:47.763
          Move! Move!

57:47.765 --> 57:52.201
  Bowman, she's gone. We gotta
  find those charges. Come on.

57:53.102 --> 57:54.603
             Fuck.

57:54.605 --> 57:56.738
      Two of them would take out
      the engine.

57:56.740 --> 57:59.174
    The other four will be below
    the waterline for sure.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.643
       We should stick together.

58:01.645 --> 58:04.146
We don't have time.
Teams of two.

58:18.028 --> 58:20.095
                        Jesus!

58:20.097 --> 58:22.064
   Just wanted to make sure.

58:43.219 --> 58:44.586
        Got one.

58:51.794 --> 58:53.762
 Magnetic.

58:53.764 --> 58:55.597
          There's nothing there.
          Is she bluffing us?

58:55.599 --> 58:57.766
     What's below us?
               The bilge, but...

58:57.768 --> 58:59.167
 there's no way to get into it.

58:59.169 --> 59:00.235
   There's no access?

59:00.237 --> 59:03.205
 Just a hole for drainage pipes.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.281
Give me that light.

59:13.816 --> 59:15.851
We better find the other one.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.179
     Gotcha.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.881
Let's go.

59:45.883 --> 59:47.716
     Gimme a minute. I can
     straighten this fucker out!

59:47.718 --> 59:49.651
We don't have a minute.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:05.100
      Found two. Any luck?
   Nothing.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.203
          The other four must be
          down here.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:10.138
You can't get in the bilge.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.374
    A man can't, but Svet could.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.644
          It's toxic down there.
          Be careful.

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.646
What do you see?

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.748
           Not much.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.789
      They're all here!
      All along one wall.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:05.060
 Russian bitch was gonna breach
 the hull on one side
 and roll us over.

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:07.362
       I'm gonna get 'em.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.665
    Be careful.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.293
                    G! G!

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.969
   There was two tons of crab
   in here.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.306
        Oh, my god.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:55.777
   Sadie! Sadie!
   You gotta get outta there!

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.779
I only have two of the charges.

01:01:57.781 --> 01:01:59.915
    There's more goo than
    we thought, a lot more!

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:00.916
             What?

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.158
                       Sadie?

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.963
  It's all around me.

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:24.873
   There's still two charges.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.232
    Oh, no! Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.399
What's wrong?

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:54.102
      I lost it.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.171
   Forget it. Please, Sadie,
   get back up here!

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.852
           I got it.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.411
Pull. Pull the rope.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.246
        Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:45.487
              Yes.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.290
         Careful,
         these are contaminated.

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:56.231
        What the hell?

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.936
 Back out of here! Go!

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.944
            Oh, god!

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:14.349
  Move! Move!

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.885
     Come on. Sadie. Sadie!
               Wait!

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:59.094
      Come on, go, go, go!
      Move it!

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:19.981
          17 minutes.

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:23.318
     Pop-Pop...
     Pop-Pop, are you hurt?

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:32.093
          Oh, no. Please don't--

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:36.998
              Sadie, stop.

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:41.703
Oh, no. Please no.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:44.272
    Nothing can be done now.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.441
      Here, here,
      we can clean it off.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.143
              Bowman.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:50.378
It's gonna be fine.
         Keep her away from me.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.015
   It'll be fine!
   I could just take it off.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:37.359
  Your bitch is dead, asshole.
  And we're still alive.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:41.062
  We're alive, so fuck you and
  your little experiment!

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:45.200
We're still alive! We're alive!
We're still alive!

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:25.233
  How long have we got, Sadie?

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.835
    12 minutes.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.872
       We gotta get this ship
       out of here.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.841
         Mr. Guillaume.
                       Yes, sir.

01:08:33.844 --> 01:08:36.144
    See if you can get that
    driveshaft straight.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.746
              Yes, sir, Captain.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:45.185
 Mr. Bowman, keep that nitrogen
 pointed at me.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.643
        Die, you bitch!

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.618
     Five seconds, Pop-Pop,
     take cover!

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.631
You gotta pilot us out of here.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.470
            Go.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:53.007
               Sadie...

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:56.844
   Don't let fear hold you down.

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:16.731
     Please, ice me now, please?

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.367
Please.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.053
              No!

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:28.669
 Sadie, get to the wheelhouse!
 Ice this fucking ship!

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.976
    Ice the ship. Ice the ship.
    Ice--

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.788
           Ice the fucking ship.

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:54.055
No! No!

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:02.890

              Harbinger down.
