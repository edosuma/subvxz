38:32.333 --> 38:33.299
Shut up!

38:33.334 --> 38:34.968
Let me go!
Shut up!

38:35.002 --> 38:36.836
Shut your mouth!

38:36.870 --> 38:38.203
[ Panting ]

38:48.114 --> 38:50.049
It's all right.
It's over.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.417
It's okay. It's okay.

38:51.451 --> 38:53.519
[ Speaking Serbian ]

38:53.553 --> 38:54.987
[ Sobs ]
He killed my sister!

38:55.021 --> 38:56.521
I know. Shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

38:56.556 --> 38:58.056
[ Cries ]

38:58.090 --> 38:59.357
Come on. Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

38:59.392 --> 39:01.126
I got her. I got her.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.160
It's okay.

39:02.195 --> 39:03.161
It's okay.

39:03.196 --> 39:04.863
It's okay.

39:04.897 --> 39:05.864
[ Sighs ]

39:05.898 --> 39:07.966
[ Police radio chatter ]

39:08.000 --> 39:10.535
I don't get too many
happy endings on this job,

39:10.570 --> 39:11.870
so thank you.

39:11.904 --> 39:14.272
How many more are out there?

39:14.306 --> 39:16.941
[ Sighs ]
There's too many.

39:16.976 --> 39:19.277
But take a look at those girls,
detective.

39:19.312 --> 39:21.613
You just gave them all
their lives back.

39:41.902 --> 39:44.870
Are you starting to like
Pinot noir more?

39:44.905 --> 39:45.905
[ Chuckles ]

39:45.939 --> 39:47.873
No.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.209
Frost and Frankie
drank all the beer.

39:50.243 --> 39:51.410
Hmm. Too bad.

39:51.444 --> 39:53.045
Hey, maybe you'll get
a new neighbor

39:53.079 --> 39:54.546
and Frankie and Fost
will help you move this mattress

39:54.581 --> 39:56.581
to your bedroom.
[ Chuckles ]

39:56.616 --> 39:58.049
That would be really nice

39:58.083 --> 40:00.251
because the traffic
is really loud out here.

40:02.554 --> 40:03.954
You did good work today.

40:05.624 --> 40:08.426
Thanks.

40:08.460 --> 40:10.929
At least Anja
didn't die in vain, you know?

40:10.963 --> 40:13.532
Lea gets to stay here in Boston
and go to college.

40:13.566 --> 40:15.935
I just think
it's so disgusting that

40:15.969 --> 40:18.671
they put her in a wedding gown
to auction her off.

40:18.705 --> 40:20.473
<i>That's</i> the part
that disgusts you?

40:20.507 --> 40:22.642
No.
All of it disgusts me.

40:22.676 --> 40:24.277
Ugh.

40:28.216 --> 40:31.385
[ Sighs ]

40:31.419 --> 40:34.087
So, you must've had a wedding
fantasy when you were little.

40:34.122 --> 40:37.925
Come on.
Every little girl has one.

40:37.959 --> 40:39.493
[ Sighs ]

40:39.528 --> 40:44.365
Okay,
it wasn't really a fantasy.

40:44.399 --> 40:50.438
It was -- I had this dumb idea
that I would say my vows

40:50.472 --> 40:55.610
at Fenway over home plate
in a Red Sox Jersey.

40:55.644 --> 40:58.413
[ Both laugh ]

40:58.447 --> 41:01.250
It's not dumb.

41:01.284 --> 41:09.058
It's not exactly elegant,
but at least it's colorful.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.361
And we would have the reception
over the pitcher's mound,

41:12.395 --> 41:17.366
and we would serve foot-long
hot dogs, and frozen lemonade.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.603
And the guests would throw
peanuts at us instead of rice.

41:20.637 --> 41:22.638
Can I come?

41:22.672 --> 41:25.241
Maybe.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.509
Okay.

41:29.479 --> 41:30.679
A Red Sox jersey?

41:30.714 --> 41:32.381
Okay, you're in fantasy.

41:32.415 --> 41:34.216
You cannot tell me
what to wear.

41:34.251 --> 41:35.384
