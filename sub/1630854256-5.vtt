WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:08.776
* *

00:23.457 --> 00:25.693
(phone rings)

00:29.663 --> 00:32.533
Hey, Dad.
Uh, now's not a good time.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.102
I know, I've been really busy.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.569
I...

00:36.804 --> 00:38.106
(coughs)

00:38.206 --> 00:42.943
No, I... it's... I'm fine.
It's just allergies.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.478
I...

00:45.813 --> 00:49.317
Oh...
I haven't seen it, I...

00:50.418 --> 00:53.854
Yeah, I like Tom Hanks.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.789
Everybody does.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.159
Hey, Dad, I can't...

00:58.259 --> 00:59.427
I-I'd love to see you,
but I just...

00:59.527 --> 01:01.395
Things are really
crazy right now,

01:01.495 --> 01:03.397
and I can't, I just...

01:03.497 --> 01:05.533
Look, Dad...

01:05.633 --> 01:07.668
Dad, I have to go.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.638
I love you.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.780
(grunts)

01:27.488 --> 01:29.723
* *

01:47.975 --> 01:50.010
* *

01:51.512 --> 01:54.382
(exhales)
Well, that was exhausting.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.885
(chuckles) I ran six miles.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.520
You bailed after two.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.788
"Bailed" sounds like "quit."

02:00.888 --> 02:02.523
I didn't quit, I changed course.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.458
Yeah, well, that course
was supposed to end

02:04.558 --> 02:05.993
with you getting us bagels.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.728
And they were out of bagels,
so I changed course again

02:07.828 --> 02:09.062
and I got us smoothies.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.864
You hate smoothies.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.800
That must have been
very hard for you.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.968
Like I said, it was exhausting.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.239
Oh, you're funny. And, uh,

02:18.339 --> 02:21.475
if you ever deny me
my morning bagel again,

02:21.575 --> 02:24.345
I'll make sure everyone
knows how funny you are.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.247
I do have a reputation
to uphold.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.651
And I have an interview
to get to, ooh.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.686
I'm still exploring my options.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.687
Oh, I think
that's good.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.756
I mean, you got the time.

02:35.856 --> 02:39.092
I do, but we have
other important decisions

02:39.193 --> 02:41.762
to start making.
Like picking a wedding date.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.832
Have you given any more thought
to early summer?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.968
June gloom.
Sounds a little risky.

02:48.068 --> 02:51.171
Then New Year's.
Two parties in one.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.773
That may actually kill Arkady.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.375
And then, of course,
you'd have to list that

02:54.475 --> 02:56.009
as his official cause of death.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.446
April?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.714
Showers. Not to mention taxes.

03:00.814 --> 03:04.652
Callen, if you want to bail...

03:04.752 --> 03:06.053
"Bail" sounds a lot like "quit."

03:06.153 --> 03:10.224
All right, then if you
want to change course...

03:10.324 --> 03:13.026
I don't want to do either.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.397
But I also don't want you to
be late for your interview.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.166
Can we talk
about this later?

03:19.267 --> 03:20.634
Sure.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.404
But there better be bagels.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.639
There will be bagels.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.648
KENSI: Let's go!

03:34.748 --> 03:35.683
We're gonna be late.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.118
I can't find my backpack.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.020
Mm. It's right here.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.422
Oh...
Wow!

03:41.522 --> 03:43.824
Just saw my life
flash before my eyes.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.426
That's a little dramatic.
Well, I'd argue

03:45.526 --> 03:46.694
it was more of a dark comedy

03:46.794 --> 03:48.396
with pivotal moments
of tenderness.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.264
Regardless, I was over too soon.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.832
Speaking of soon,

03:51.932 --> 03:53.233
I'm gonna miss History
if we don't leave, like, now.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.468
Great, yeah. No, of course.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.836
And you-you have your essay

03:55.936 --> 03:57.237
on the-the tragedy
that is the Great Depression?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.907
Yes, but I argued it was
more of a dark comedy

04:00.007 --> 04:01.442
with pivotal moments
of tenderness.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.944
Wow. Now, that is a touché.
Well played.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.178
Kensi!

04:05.279 --> 04:06.347
Yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.881
Hey, by the way,
(door opens)

04:07.981 --> 04:09.216
(phone vibrates)
we definitely
don't have time

04:09.317 --> 04:10.651
to pick up your truck
in the morning,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.420
but we can do it after work.
Oh, my God.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.588
Yeah, if we survive that long.
Hello?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.856
Oh.
ROBERTA: Hello?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.758
I come back from
six months on the road

04:17.858 --> 04:19.727
and that's how
you answer the phone?

04:19.827 --> 04:21.595
It's kind of a universally
accepted phone greeting.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.731
But, okay...
Wait a minute, back from what?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.533
ROBERTA:
A woman can only eat, pray,

04:25.633 --> 04:27.468
and love her way
across the lower 48

04:27.568 --> 04:29.403
for so long. (laughing)

04:29.503 --> 04:31.672
But boy, did I love.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.708
T... TMI, Mom.
It was like Woodstock,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.677
all over again,
only this time with sciatica.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.678
DEEKS: Mom,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.012
boundaries!
Okay.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.648
Uh, I'm really glad
that you're back.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.883
Uh, we're really glad.
Super, super glad.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.619
But just to clarify,
when you say "back..."

04:45.719 --> 04:46.854
In L.A.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.323
Interesting because, uh,

04:49.423 --> 04:50.824
you rented out your apartment

04:50.924 --> 04:52.760
two days after
you saw Nomadland.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.996
Which is why
I'm on my way to your house.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.032
I'll be there in 30. And someone
better be there to let me in,

04:59.132 --> 05:01.602
(horn honks)
because I haven't eaten
or prayed since Reno.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.437
Mwah, I love you.
I can't wait.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.205
Okay. You know what?
We'll figure it out on the way.
Yep.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.674
Nope, yep.
That's fine.
It's gonna be fine.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.075
She's loving her way
through Reno.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.309
That's what you want to hear
with your mom.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.345
(thudding)
(grunting)

05:15.383 --> 05:17.985
ROUNTREE:
"Ready your breakfast
and eat hearty,

05:18.085 --> 05:20.654
for tonight we dine in hell!"

05:20.754 --> 05:22.390
(grunting)
Rountree,

05:22.490 --> 05:24.725
what are you doing?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.228
If you're gonna work
in this office,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.064
you're gonna have to brush up
on your classic movie quotes.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.800
It's from 300.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.101
But what I meant is

05:34.201 --> 05:36.770
what are you doing
to that bucket?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.874
It's called hojo undo.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.477
Ancient martial arts techniques
that are meant to build

05:43.577 --> 05:45.513
grip and forearm strength.
I have

05:45.613 --> 05:46.680
a troll-shaped stress doll

05:46.780 --> 05:48.148
that also works great for that.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.517
(phone vibrating)

05:49.617 --> 05:51.284
Can you do me a favor?
That might be a case.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.556
Uh, it's a text from someone
named Packer who says,

05:55.656 --> 05:58.526
"My pants are fire"?
(laughing)

05:58.626 --> 05:59.893
I'm afraid to ask.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.929
Yeah, it's my homie,
Daniel Packer.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.531
We were at Quantico together.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.898
He's, uh,
making a clothing line,

06:04.998 --> 06:06.233
so I figured I might invest

06:06.333 --> 06:07.968
some of that money
that Beale left us.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.603
Oh, I heard about that money.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.639
I think that
I would spend that all

06:11.739 --> 06:13.441
on first class tickets to Tokyo.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.943
Yeah. I thought about that.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.480
But after what happened
to me and my sister,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.849
just... didn't feel right.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.418
Nothing feels right after that.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.820
You know...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.756
I want that money
to grow something.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.157
So I called a few friends

06:30.257 --> 06:32.793
and asked 'em
to pitch me some ideas.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.862
You didn't think
about asking me?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.730
Ha! The world does not need

06:36.830 --> 06:39.567
any more troll-shaped
stress dolls.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.169
Oof, that's harsh.
So is this.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.704
Oh!

06:43.804 --> 06:44.972
(exhales)

06:45.072 --> 06:47.407
Now, that was fire.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.242
Well, a cruise doesn't just
appear out of nowhere.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.011
I mean, you're not
David Copperfield.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.213
Why would I need a sign off

06:53.313 --> 06:55.983
when I am the sign off?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.951
Well, thank you for
the seven hours notice.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.154
Oh, and thank you so much
for continuing to be

07:01.254 --> 07:04.291
an overly-coddled
thorn in my ass.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.827
(both sigh)

07:06.927 --> 07:08.629
My father's caretaker
just quit.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.564
Third one this month.
Mm.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.999
You?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.602
There is yet another
process in place

07:14.702 --> 07:17.638
for expense approvals.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.807
I had a system in
place for my dad.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.208
But the system only works

07:21.308 --> 07:22.576
if I can get people
to play by the rules.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.712
(chortles)
Good luck with that one.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.779
Speaking of which,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.447
where is everyone?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.850
Well, I mean, you seem to
have it covered on your own.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.919
(sighs)
Who's this?

07:32.019 --> 07:34.387
Uh, Lieutenant Jeff Morgan.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.858
Found stabbed to death
this morning by a house cleaner.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.794
He was an intelligence officer
assigned to

07:40.894 --> 07:42.896
a DoD task force

07:42.996 --> 07:47.000
based out of Naval Munitions
Command CONUS West.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.738
They deal primarily with
naval weapons inventory.
Yeah.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.906
I wish it stopped at the Navy.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.476
Morgan was part of
a highly-classified operation

07:56.577 --> 07:57.978
developing software

07:58.078 --> 08:01.815
aimed at networking
the entire U.S. military.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.953
Similar to Project Overmatch,
only bigger.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.622
Well, if an enemy can
access that software,

08:08.722 --> 08:11.491
they could expose top secret
intel across every branch.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.795
Which is why SECNAV
wants us to make sure

08:14.895 --> 08:16.964
that nothing
has been compromised.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.498
Got any suspects?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.801
China. Russia. Iran.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.402
Or his wife,

08:22.502 --> 08:24.037
Alice Morgan.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.840
One of those things
is not like the others.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.343
A neighbor saw her
fleeing the scene

08:30.443 --> 08:32.580
shortly after Morgan's
estimated TOD.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.081
There's an APB out for her.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.384
So, either she is being
targeted too...

08:37.484 --> 08:40.520
Or Alice Morgan
isn't playing by the rules.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.832
Sushi.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.501
You wanted Sugarfish,
which I selflessly agreed,

08:54.602 --> 08:56.837
to which you replied,
and I quote, "I owe you one."

08:56.937 --> 08:59.072
Okay, I meant
unpack the groceries,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.708
not spend
the entire day unpacking

09:00.808 --> 09:02.643
your mother's weird obsession
with Michael Bublé.
Okay,

09:02.743 --> 09:05.813
he is a good-natured crooner who
refuses to look bad in a tux.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.014
What's to unpack?

09:07.114 --> 09:09.082
Sweetheart, she's your mother.
I know that.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.784
Uh, hey!
Ooh, Callen.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.620
I'm an orphan.
Can't help you.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.887
That's good.
You're very funny.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.422
Has anyone ever
told you that?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.926
(chuckles)
(chuckles) You know, if I knew

09:19.026 --> 09:20.794
you guys were throwing a party,
I would've brought bagels.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.395
Well, you got to get up
pretty early

09:22.495 --> 09:23.964
to beat the crowd for that.
I was up at 5:00,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.866
in the office at 8:00
working on a case.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.567
You guys remember cases, right?
Case?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.236
I got Kilbride's text.
Were you able to get ahold

09:29.336 --> 09:31.204
of Morgan's commanding officer?
I'm on my way to the boatshed

09:31.304 --> 09:32.539
to meet with him now.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.007
Then I think I'm going with you.
Great.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.943
Perfect.
All right.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.410
Rountree's gonna
hit the crime scene.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.478
You two should
meet him there, huh?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.714
Got it.
Wa... Can... So...

09:40.814 --> 09:42.415
Oh, my gosh.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.953
Okay, fine. I will
spend the day with Mama D.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.021
Kilbride wants me to take
some accrued leave anyway.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.489
Are you sure?
Yes.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.458
We'll have fun.
I'll pick up Rosa early.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.893
They can meet for the first time

09:52.993 --> 09:54.361
and then I can
have reinforcements.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.896
I owe you one.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.666
Ha! It's funny that you think
you owe me just one.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.301
(honks horn)
Oh, God. I got it.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.536
I'm going, I'm going.
(engine revving)

10:06.473 --> 10:07.775
ROUNTREE:
All right, thanks, guys.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.577
LAPD found a personal laptop,
but it's locked.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.680
Shyla's gonna get
a warrant to access it.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.514
You find anything
interesting?
Yeah.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.884
That Achievable Design
is only achievable

10:16.984 --> 10:18.551
for those people
with disposable income

10:18.652 --> 10:20.788
and a questionable
definition of design.

10:20.888 --> 10:24.024
Uh, speaking of money, coroner
found a Rolex on Morgan's wrist,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.126
and his Lexus is still parked
in the garage.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.995
Well, I think we can
rule out home invasion.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.864
Yeah, but I didn't think junior
officers made Rolex money.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.633
They don't. And they also
don't make enough money

10:33.734 --> 10:35.302
to cover these
credit cards bills.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.671
Well, their neighbors said
Alice Morgan didn't work a job,

10:37.771 --> 10:39.707
so if she grew accustomed
to the finer things,

10:39.807 --> 10:41.842
they would've had to have
a extra way of paying for it.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.343
Yeah, well, maybe they were

10:43.443 --> 10:45.478
selling classified
military software.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.147
Well, if we had a way
of tracking her down,

10:47.247 --> 10:48.348
we could ask her.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.649
Maybe we do.
Looks like the Morgans

10:49.750 --> 10:51.952
have been living
in the fast lane.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.453
Uh, yeah.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.055
Fancy watches,
expensive cars.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.624
Were you not present for
this whole conversation?
(chuckles)

10:57.725 --> 10:59.026
The literal fast lane.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.861
This credit card bill
has electronic toll charges

11:00.961 --> 11:02.362
all over it.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.631
Well, if Alice Morgan's
trying to get out of Dodge,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.066
toll roads would be
the fastest way.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.200
That's what I'm saying.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.568
That's what I'm saying.
Good.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.570
Commander Burns.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.740
Thank you for coming in
to speak with us.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.108
It's not like
I was given the choice.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.478
You gentleman are aware
of cell phones, correct?

11:18.578 --> 11:19.679
And you are aware
that one of your men

11:19.780 --> 11:21.248
was murdered last night,
correct?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.583
It's a tragedy.
Truly.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.552
But now, instead of
being in my office

11:25.652 --> 11:26.787
dealing with the fallout,

11:26.887 --> 11:29.222
I've been summoned
to a Bubba Gump's

11:29.322 --> 11:30.257
to talk to you two.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.093
So...
start talking.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.962
You first.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.264
What kind of software
is your team was developing?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.733
It's a cloud-like technology

11:39.833 --> 11:41.735
that allows us to share data

11:41.835 --> 11:43.737
across all the armed forces.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.740
Everything from emails
to weapons, ordnance

11:46.840 --> 11:49.609
and explosives tracking
to real-time target tracing.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.411
And how does Lieutenant Morgan
fit into this?

11:51.511 --> 11:54.047
He primarily oversaw
data analytics

11:54.147 --> 11:56.817
until about a month ago,
when I put him on the road.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.087
I had him visiting local
contractors and manufacturers

12:00.187 --> 12:02.289
to confirm their systems
were up to date

12:02.389 --> 12:03.656
and fully operational.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.192
Did he have any enemies?

12:05.292 --> 12:08.595
Not that I know of.
He seemed like a good kid.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.865
But with hundreds
of command members,

12:11.965 --> 12:14.935
I don't have the time to delve
in everyone's personal life.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.137
So, I take it you never
met his wife?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.040
Once, maybe.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.708
Quiet.
(scoffs)

12:21.809 --> 12:24.377
Not very friendly,
if I remember correctly.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.179
To be clear, she was unfriendly?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.749
I really have to get back.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.587
If you have any more questions,

12:34.687 --> 12:37.324
please don't hesitate
to contact my office.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.660
Uh, you know, by phone.
Mm.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.732
So, a month after Morgan is
transferred he winds up dead.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.367
Yeah, we should pull
his travel vouchers.
(door opens)

12:47.467 --> 12:48.936
(door closes)
Find out what else
he might have been up to

12:49.036 --> 12:50.470
while he was out there
on the road.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.840
I'll reach out to his office.
You know, by phone.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.141
(chuckles)

12:54.241 --> 12:55.675
KILBRIDE:
What have we got, Agent Dahr?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.978
A giant headache, sir.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.747
Welcome to the last
40 years of my life.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.383
I would recommend
an aspirin, but

13:03.483 --> 13:06.686
I have always found that
a good single malt scotch

13:06.786 --> 13:07.988
is a lot quicker.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.289
I didn't mean
a literal headache.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.924
I meant it figuratively.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.894
I didn't know we were putting
nuance in our sitreps now.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.728
And I didn't know
how frustrating

13:15.829 --> 13:17.931
the sharing economy can be.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.868
Businesses that rely on
community-based marketplaces.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.036
I assume this will
all relate back

13:23.136 --> 13:25.372
to my original question,
"what do we got?"

13:25.472 --> 13:27.174
I got a warrant to access

13:27.274 --> 13:29.709
the laptop LAPD found
in Morgan's home.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.044
Most accounts were logged out,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.180
but luckily,
it was still synced up

13:33.280 --> 13:36.249
to Alice Morgan's text messages,
which is where

13:36.349 --> 13:39.786
I found this very vague
confirmation code.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.189
I traced the number
the text came from

13:42.289 --> 13:45.325
to a company called
Home Connections.

13:45.425 --> 13:49.062
They specialize in discreet
vacation rentals.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.131
So discreet that
I'm still waiting on

13:51.231 --> 13:53.366
the manager to give me
access to her account.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.268
Mm.
Should be any minute now.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.636
Better let me talk to them.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.538
I will make sure that
there is no nuance

13:58.638 --> 14:00.073
in what I have to say.
(beep)

14:00.173 --> 14:02.943
Oh, may not be necessary.
I'm in.

14:03.043 --> 14:07.680
Hey, looks like Alice Morgan
used a gift credit card

14:07.780 --> 14:11.384
and a fake name to book
a house in Larchmont

14:11.484 --> 14:13.286
an hour after
her husband's death.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.422
Get this address
to Rountree and Deeks.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.957
I want her picked up now.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.826
Wow. Man, the owners were
smart

14:19.927 --> 14:21.294
to invest in this place.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.497
Great walk score,
mountain views.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.632
All right, Warren Buffett,

14:25.732 --> 14:27.200
why all the investment
talk today?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.069
I just want to do better
with my money, you know?

14:29.169 --> 14:31.704
I want it to
actually help people,

14:31.804 --> 14:33.573
like...
Alice Morgan.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.042
No, not Alice Morgan.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.376
She's clearly
spending enough.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.279
Are you okay today?
No, no. Alice Morgan.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.982
Oh. Alice Morgan.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.684
Oh, don't...

14:44.784 --> 14:46.319
(groans)

14:46.419 --> 14:48.088
I should have stretched.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.127
(grunts)

14:55.162 --> 14:56.263
Ow.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.431
Federal agents. Stop.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.201
Hands up. Step down.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.003
Come towards me.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.006
I have a gun
in my waistband.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.340
Go.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.045
Wow.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.614
You good?

15:14.714 --> 15:15.949
Yeah.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.052
I just got to invest
in a chiropractor.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.498
All right, there's a
couple ways this can go.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.166
Which is really exciting for me,

15:33.266 --> 15:36.569
because I've always loved a good
Choose Your Own Adventure.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.206
You know what I'm saying?
Cave of Time?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.308
House of Danger?

15:41.408 --> 15:43.043
Lost Jewels of Nabooti?

15:43.143 --> 15:45.412
Yeah? No?
What about you?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.814
Really?
It's a book series

15:47.914 --> 15:50.417
where you get to choose
how your story unfolds.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.419
ROUNTREE:
Look, we have you fleeing

15:52.519 --> 15:54.721
the scene of your
husband's murder.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.357
You're our prime suspect.
But if you cooperate,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.892
you too can choose
how your story unfolds.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.694
I'm not telling you anything.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.331
Look, we can sit here
all day, all right?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.799
But being silent only hurts you.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.201
We're here to help.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.503
You want to help me now?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.439
Where were you six months ago?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.874
Why, what happened
six months ago?

16:14.974 --> 16:18.378
I talked and I talked
and I talked,

16:18.478 --> 16:19.746
and no one seemed
to listen then,

16:19.846 --> 16:22.482
so I'm not saying anything now.
Mrs. Morgan,

16:22.582 --> 16:24.317
we're only
trying to help.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.554
Um, actually,
we should take a...

16:27.654 --> 16:28.921
We can...
we should take a break.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.490
Do you want a...
I want to get a coffee.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.858
Me?
Do you want a
coffee? I bet she

16:31.958 --> 16:32.992
needs some coffee.
You want some coffee?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.461
I don't need a coffee.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.096
Yeah, well,
the people of Nabooti

16:36.196 --> 16:39.066
didn't think they needed, uh,
Lucy and Peter's help,

16:39.166 --> 16:41.501
but at the end of the day,
they were glad to have it.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.471
I'll grab you a coffee.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.005
(door opens)

16:47.274 --> 16:48.641
Everything all right
with your dad?

16:48.741 --> 16:52.345
Yeah, if I can find someone
to stay with him tomorrow.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.813
What happened to Cheryl?
She was great.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.615
And very into
birds, by the way.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.784
Yeah, apparently,
they fell on the different sides

16:57.884 --> 16:59.452
of the war pigeon debate.
(chuckles)

16:59.552 --> 17:02.655
She quit last week.
I got to find a new agency.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.226
Well, that's one approach.
What's that supposed to mean?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.461
Look, the last caretaker quit

17:08.561 --> 17:10.263
because your Dad
wouldn't ride in his Mazda.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
He prefers American cars.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.402
I'm just saying.
Maybe it's not the caretakers.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.404
Maybe you're avoiding
the real issue here.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.072
You want to talk to me
about avoidance?

17:19.172 --> 17:21.308
Well, I didn't say I wanted
to talk to you about it.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.843
Did you pick
your wedding date yet?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.413
Oh, you think
I'm avoiding my wedding?

17:26.513 --> 17:28.548
I think you're keeping
Anna in the dark

17:28.648 --> 17:29.882
about what's going on,

17:29.982 --> 17:31.551
and whatever it is,
she'll understand.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.420
But you have to
give her a chance.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.823
Don't even think
about sitting.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.532
Just heard from Rountree.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.267
Alice Morgan
still isn't talking.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.302
Did Commander Burns' office

17:49.402 --> 17:50.670
send over
Morgan's travel vouchers?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.805
Yep. Uh, at first,
nothing stood out.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.974
Then I remembered that
in addition to his wife's

17:55.074 --> 17:57.177
electronic toll pass records,
I had his too.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.079
So I cross-referenced them
with his travel vouchers

18:00.180 --> 18:02.582
and it turns out something
is definitely rotten

18:02.682 --> 18:04.651
in the state of Denmark.
Lovely.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.120
Now we're doing
Shakespeare in the park.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.424
Lieutenant Morgan took the same
freeway to and from the office

18:11.524 --> 18:12.959
at about the same time
every day.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.695
That all changed a month ago.
Yeah, well, that tracks.

18:15.795 --> 18:16.696
That's when
he started traveling for work.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.064
Which took him everywhere

18:18.165 --> 18:20.333
from PennCo Metrics
to Marview Chemicals

18:20.433 --> 18:21.601
to Parnell Industries.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.403
All of which manufacture
high-powered,

18:23.503 --> 18:25.305
military-grade explosives.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.374
SHYLA:
Exactly, and after each trip

18:27.474 --> 18:31.077
to those specific manufacturers,
his toll pass pinged a responder

18:31.178 --> 18:33.680
near the Santa Anita Avenue exit
off the 10.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.014
The Morgans live out
in Jefferson Park.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.883
That's over 20 miles
past their house.

18:36.983 --> 18:40.153
Which is why I inputted his most
recent trip into Kaleidoscope.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.323
Traffic cams caught him
pulling into a storage facility

18:43.423 --> 18:44.891
in El Monte on Friday.

18:44.991 --> 18:48.161
Friday? So, two days
before he was murdered.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.396
So whatever he's keeping there

18:49.496 --> 18:50.963
may help explain
what got him killed.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.166
"Though this be madness,

18:53.266 --> 18:55.235
yet there is method in't."

18:55.335 --> 18:57.270
(phone vibrates)
SAM: Damn it.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.573
My father's caretaker agency,
they need to speak with me

19:00.673 --> 19:01.841
before they can find
a replacement.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.910
Uh, take the call,
Agent Hanna.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.045
Ms. Dahr can use
the fresh air.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.714
Thanks for that.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.953
Actually, you mind
if I go into it alone?

19:14.053 --> 19:16.423
Uh, yeah, sure.
All right, thanks, man.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.225
Yeah.

19:22.595 --> 19:27.567
So it's, uh...
June 30, 1990.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.836
And my mom decides
she wants to take me

19:29.936 --> 19:32.472
to watch the Dodgers
play the Cardinals.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.476
And I will never
forget that day.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.312
I don't care about sports.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.047
That's funny, 'cause I don't
care about sports either.

19:41.147 --> 19:45.017
No, the reason I remember it
is 'cause it was so hot.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.088
Like, L.A. had been coming off
this massive heat wave

19:49.188 --> 19:51.791
and I can still see
the ice cream cone melting

19:51.891 --> 19:53.693
as it's being passed
down the row.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.563
Now you want
to talk about weather?

19:58.331 --> 20:01.634
Actually, I do, because...

20:01.734 --> 20:03.336
that is the other thing
that I can still see

20:03.436 --> 20:06.072
from that day, is my mom.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.976
And she's sitting next to me
in this 90-degree heat,

20:10.076 --> 20:13.112
except for the fact
that she is wearing...

20:13.212 --> 20:14.947
(chuckles softly)

20:15.815 --> 20:19.185
She's wearing jeans and
a long-sleeve turtleneck.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.858
And she was covered up like that
the whole entire summer.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.660
(sniffles)
Not that it matters,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.663
because she couldn't
cover the bruises on her face.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.635
Did he spare you, at least?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.237
No.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.840
I mean, but I was a kid, right?

20:40.940 --> 20:43.042
Kids are supposed
to have bruises.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.880
(sniffles)

20:47.980 --> 20:50.216
I'd just tell the teachers
that, um...

20:52.385 --> 20:54.854
...I got another fight
in the playground.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.992
What do you tell people?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.764
I don't have
anyone left to tell.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.701
He made me push everyone away.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.570
Yeah, they do that.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.310
How long has your husband
been abusing you?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.811
Physically?

21:21.213 --> 21:22.782
Three years.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.884
Mentally? Who knows.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.288
He even cut off my access
to our bank account.

21:31.324 --> 21:35.194
He controlled every part
of my life.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.899
And you reported him
six months ago?

21:41.468 --> 21:43.803
I called some military hotline,

21:43.903 --> 21:46.072
and when I didn't hear back

21:46.172 --> 21:49.842
I filed a report with
the family advocacy center.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.680
They said they were
looking into it.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.116
I got to ask you this
'cause it's my job,

21:57.216 --> 21:59.318
but I don't blame you
if you did.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.091
Did you kill your husband?

22:05.191 --> 22:07.460
No.
Okay.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.897
He was like that
when I came home.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.603
Can you believe,

22:16.703 --> 22:18.705
after all this,

22:18.805 --> 22:21.874
I even tried to save him?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.243
I can.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.079
So, why did you run?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.416
Because...

22:30.850 --> 22:34.887
...my husband was worth a lot
to the military.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.857
I'm not.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.992
They're gonna want
someone to pay for this,

22:40.092 --> 22:41.861
and I was afraid that my reports

22:41.961 --> 22:43.963
would be used as motive.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.033
That tracks.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.403
So, your husband has been
traveling a lot for work.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.838
Have you noticed
any differences,

22:51.938 --> 22:53.339
any changes in him since then?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.742
Sorry, can I have
a few minutes?
Yeah, of course.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.677
You can have
as much time as you want.

22:58.645 --> 22:59.679
Motor oil.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.247
Sorry, what?

23:02.281 --> 23:04.016
When he h...

23:06.853 --> 23:10.523
When he came close to me
after those trips,

23:10.623 --> 23:13.392
his hands smelled
like motor oil.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.163
I'm sorry.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.732
ROBERTA:
One minute, I'm signing up

23:19.832 --> 23:22.669
for a polar bear plunge,
next thing I know

23:22.769 --> 23:25.905
I'm 20 miles off the strip,
skinny dipping at a Ramada Inn

23:26.005 --> 23:27.440
with a broken pool
heater. (chuckles)

23:27.540 --> 23:30.577
(giggles)
That's one version
of an ice breaker.

23:30.677 --> 23:33.245
Yeah, that sounds like
a very fun trip.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.616
Adele is doing a residency
in Vegas right now.
Ooh.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.185
I'd love to go.
I didn't know that.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.454
Listen, if you want to
go see Adele,

23:41.554 --> 23:43.790
I don't think Deeks
would mind taking a trip.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.626
Uh, actually, Tay's family
has a condo there

23:46.726 --> 23:47.860
and they said I could go

23:47.960 --> 23:50.262
if that's okay.
Yes.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.998
Of course, yeah.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.466
Tay...
(chuckles)

23:53.566 --> 23:54.801
I don't-I don't think
we've spoken about her.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.302
My friend from Calculus.

23:56.402 --> 23:59.772
Oh, Calculus. Now, that's
a waste of time.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.708
Oh, that's definitely not...

24:01.808 --> 24:04.343
I have had a
disastrous marriage,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.178
three dead-end jobs, and

24:06.278 --> 24:09.381
a little quick brush with
a pyramid scheme. And not

24:09.482 --> 24:10.950
one of those problems

24:11.050 --> 24:13.019
was solved by
the Pythagorean theorem.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.687
That's actually geometry...

24:14.787 --> 24:16.523
You are very cool.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.390
Right back at you, sis.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.726
I'll bet you're gonna

24:19.826 --> 24:21.694
keep these two on their toes.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.929
(chuckles)

24:23.029 --> 24:24.964
ROSA:
Speaking of which,

24:25.064 --> 24:27.600
Uh, Kensi, do you think
you could take me and Tay

24:27.700 --> 24:29.201
to the mall after school?
Mm-hmm.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.703
Uh, we were gonna get new
cleats for soccer practice.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.305
Soccer practice.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.407
You definitely
told me about that.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.945
Well, I'm pretty sure

24:39.045 --> 24:41.548
I didn't tell you about
the sound bath I took

24:41.648 --> 24:43.950
behind the Dairy Queen in Marfa.

24:44.050 --> 24:48.054
So, ladies, buckle up.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.722
And you're sure this was the guy

24:49.822 --> 24:51.357
that rented
the storage unit from you?

24:51.457 --> 24:54.260
Positive. Dude was intense.
Like you two, but different.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.928
What do you
mean by that?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.730
I mean I would not
want to be on the other side

24:57.830 --> 24:59.599
of a board game from you.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.668
You...
I'd take my chances with.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.369
(chuckling)
I meant Jeff Morgan.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.404
That wasn't
the name he gave me.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.473
Well, I'm sure
he used a fake one.
Mm.

25:07.574 --> 25:10.376
He used all cash, too.
And it was wet.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.613
My mans was real sweaty...
Ooh, this is it.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.114
All right, well.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.749
We need anything else,
we'll let you know.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.118
All righty.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.860
(exhales) Could have come
and cleaned the place out

25:27.960 --> 25:30.897
before he was killed.
Or someone did it after.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.499
You smell that?

25:34.333 --> 25:36.769
They put odorizing taggants
in explosives

25:36.869 --> 25:38.004
to make them more detectable.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.405
Some say that it smells
like almonds,

25:39.505 --> 25:43.776
but most, uh, think
it smells like motor oil.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.045
Alice Morgan told Deeks
her husband

25:46.145 --> 25:48.180
smelled like motor oil
after he traveled.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.049
And Morgan
recently gained access

25:50.149 --> 25:52.852
to every military
explosives manufacturer

25:52.952 --> 25:54.186
across Southern California.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.788
Which means he had
access to everything

25:55.888 --> 25:58.257
from det-cord to Comp B to...
To C-4.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.827
Usually, it's
stored in bricks,

26:00.927 --> 26:01.928
but cut into
smaller pieces,

26:02.028 --> 26:03.830
it tends to crumble.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.065
What if this was never
about his software?

26:06.165 --> 26:09.101
What if Morgan was
using his access

26:09.201 --> 26:10.670
to slowly stockpile explosives

26:10.770 --> 26:13.405
until he had a supply
large enough to sell?

26:14.340 --> 26:18.077
Well, if that's the case,
where is it all now?

26:28.554 --> 26:30.623
Hey, if there's a dead body,
I call dibs.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.258
My true crime podcast
needs this.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.761
No dead body, but this is now
an active crime scene.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.629
We'll need you to keep
all the customers out.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.064
Mm, and if they don't listen,

26:38.164 --> 26:39.598
can I perform
a citizen's arrest?

26:39.699 --> 26:40.633
No, you cannot.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.901
(scoffs)
You're no fun.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.335
Well, you should
see what happens

26:43.435 --> 26:44.403
when someone
sinks my battleship.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.038
When was
the last time you saw

26:46.138 --> 26:47.573
someone access
that storage unit?

26:47.674 --> 26:49.108
Well, there were three guys

26:49.208 --> 26:50.509
I didn't recognize this morning.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.911
They were taking out boxes

26:52.011 --> 26:54.113
through the back.
You have cameras back there?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.182
Yeah, but my manager
is the only one with access.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.051
Call him, tell him
to expect a call from us.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.787
We're gonna need
to see those videos.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.855
Mm, and if he doesn't
cooperate, can I...

27:02.955 --> 27:04.123
No!
No!

27:06.358 --> 27:07.827
I'll track down
Commander Burns.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.628
Hopefully he put together
a list of every weapon

27:09.729 --> 27:11.898
and explosive that is
currently unaccounted for.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.033
Got it.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.769
KILBRIDE:
Alice Morgan

27:16.869 --> 27:18.137
is telling the truth.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.674
The Navy confirms
that she did make calls

27:21.774 --> 27:23.509
to abuse hotline several times

27:23.609 --> 27:25.845
leading up
to her husband's death.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.515
Did they say if anyone
ever acted upon those calls?

27:29.615 --> 27:32.184
Their official response is that

27:32.284 --> 27:35.822
they take all domestic abuse
cases seriously

27:35.922 --> 27:39.358
and there was not enough
information to refer to us.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.760
The hell?

27:40.860 --> 27:42.895
So, Morgan just beats
the hell out of his wife

27:42.995 --> 27:44.663
and doesn't even get
a slap on the wrist?

27:44.764 --> 27:46.065
It's a problem
that's been getting

27:46.165 --> 27:48.835
a lot of justifiable attention
in the press lately.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.904
The Pentagon invested
one billion dollars

27:52.004 --> 27:55.507
specifically to remedy
this very problem.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.243
They are headed
in the right direction.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.078
Well, think of how much money
they could have saved

27:59.178 --> 28:01.047
if they just would have
prioritized the victims

28:01.147 --> 28:02.815
to begin with, sir.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.851
There are only so many problems

28:04.951 --> 28:06.853
that we can solve in one day,

28:06.953 --> 28:09.121
this case being one of them.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.456
Well, that's convenient.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.859
If Alice didn't
kill her husband,

28:12.959 --> 28:16.628
see if she has any idea who did.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.668
Was all that true?
About your dad?

28:25.772 --> 28:27.539
Every word of it.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.612
ROBERTA:
Hey, Kensi?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.681
You're out of dryer sheets.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.616
Oof.
Where's Rosa?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.651
Tay is having a crisis
with another friend,

28:39.752 --> 28:42.288
so Rosa is talking them down.
(exhales)

28:42.388 --> 28:43.890
You don't have to do this.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.758
Oh, I don't mind.
I've missed helping out.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.059
(chuckles)
Well...

28:47.159 --> 28:50.196
Deeks and I have
missed you helping out.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.731
(laughing)
Nice try.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.234
You can't even look me
in the eye and say that.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.804
(laughs)

28:59.371 --> 29:00.907
How you doing, kiddo?

29:01.007 --> 29:04.143
Great. Good.
(chuckles)

29:04.243 --> 29:07.046
Fine. Tired.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.048
And hungry, like,
all the time.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.350
Mm.
Welcome to parenthood.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.718
Mm, thank you,

29:12.819 --> 29:15.922
but I am not "technically"
a parent yet.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.024
Do you love her

29:18.124 --> 29:20.092
and want nothing more
than to keep her safe?

29:20.192 --> 29:21.227
Of course.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.062
And do you constantly wake up

29:23.162 --> 29:25.197
with the crushing fear
that you're not doing enough

29:25.297 --> 29:28.000
even though you're exhausted
from doing too much?

29:28.935 --> 29:31.070
Every single morning.

29:31.170 --> 29:35.141
Well, then I don't give a damn
about the technicalities.

29:35.241 --> 29:38.210
You're a parent, sister.
(exhales) Thanks.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.680
but I just can't help but feel
like I'm missing something

29:41.780 --> 29:42.815
all the time.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.951
You know, my entire career

29:45.051 --> 29:46.618
is spent being one step
ahead of somebody else,

29:46.718 --> 29:48.787
and I thought it would be
the same thing with parenting,

29:48.888 --> 29:51.357
and it's just not.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.791
Hmm.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.027
My mother once gave me
the best parenting advice

29:55.127 --> 29:55.995
I've ever heard.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.964
Yeah?
She said, "Bertie,

29:58.064 --> 30:01.400
raising kids is like being
pecked to death by chickens."

30:01.500 --> 30:04.603
I think she saw it on a sign
in a gift shop at a rest stop.

30:04.703 --> 30:08.040
Geez. Thought it'd be something
a little more optimistic.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.708
Oh, my God.
What are you talking about?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.343
It's a slow death.

30:11.443 --> 30:16.448
You've got all the time
in the world to figure it out.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.117
(laugh)

30:23.789 --> 30:25.824
I got your text, Shyla.
What's up?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.426
Nothing good, Shark Tank.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.727
Just got security footage

30:28.827 --> 30:30.596
from Lieutenant Morgan's
storage space.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.198
You should have it now.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.168
Huh.
Oh, great.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.237
So, we're looking for
three potentially armed

30:38.337 --> 30:40.072
and dangerous pixels.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.542
Needless to say, facial rec is
having trouble getting an ID.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.644
All right, well, I'll put it
in front of Alice Morgan

30:45.744 --> 30:47.346
and see if she recognizes
any of them.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.181
Thanks, Shyla.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.084
(sighs)
Sorry to interrupt.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.620
We just got security cam footage

30:54.720 --> 30:57.256
of a storage unit that's
linked to your husband's name.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.692
These three guys were trying
to access his unit this morning.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.428
You recognize
any of them?

31:02.528 --> 31:05.331
Hard to tell.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.834
That guy.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.570
My husband
brought me to an event

31:11.670 --> 31:12.905
a few weeks ago.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.908
Some type of wine festival.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.209
I don't know his name,

31:17.309 --> 31:18.610
but I saw them
talking to each other.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.878
And you're sure it was him?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.447
I remember thinking how badly

31:21.547 --> 31:23.049
he needed to wash his hair.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.816
Do you remember the date?

31:26.618 --> 31:29.021
My birthday.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.191
Here I thought he was finally
doing something nice for me.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.662
It was somewhere in Hollywood.
Near the cemetery.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.264
I'm gonna give this to Shyla.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.631
Yeah, right.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.801
Investigator Deeks.
Yeah?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.337
What happened to your father?

31:47.339 --> 31:48.840
I shot him.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.778
And two weeks later,
he was in prison.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.415
You did good.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.319
(door closes)

32:00.419 --> 32:02.888
(phone chimes)
I should look into this.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.159
Just in time.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.962
Commander Burns.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.530
How's the fallout down there?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.065
Gentlemen, I assure you,

32:13.165 --> 32:15.334
I am all over this matter.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.369
Have you put together
a list of the items

32:17.469 --> 32:18.504
that are currently missing?

32:18.604 --> 32:20.372
ATF has been in contact

32:20.472 --> 32:23.242
with every manufacturer
that Morgan visited.

32:23.342 --> 32:27.213
We're looking at somewhere
between 15 and 25 pounds

32:27.313 --> 32:30.849
of C-4, Composition B
and detcord,

32:30.949 --> 32:33.986
not to mention an unknown supply
of blasting caps.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.988
That's quite a big range.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.456
And if not handled properly,

32:37.556 --> 32:39.825
it can cause
an even bigger amount of damage.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.627
So, were you aware

32:41.727 --> 32:44.330
of the reports filed
against Morgan by his wife?

32:44.430 --> 32:45.931
Yes.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.434
But I required further evidence

32:48.534 --> 32:51.470
before I could pull him
from his assignment.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.005
Now, before you blame me,

32:53.105 --> 32:54.606
let me expl...
SHYLA: Guys,

32:54.706 --> 32:56.142
you need to see this.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.210
We'll be in touch.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.279
CALLEN:
What do we got?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.648
Something between bad news
and very, very bad news.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.583
Oh, great.
Another big range.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.486
SHYLA:
Alice Morgan said her husband
controlled their bank account.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.421
What she didn't know
is that he controlled

33:09.521 --> 33:11.223
multiple bank accounts,

33:11.323 --> 33:12.958
three of which
received separate deposits

33:13.059 --> 33:15.027
in the amount of $9,000
last week.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.763
Just under the amount that would
trigger a CTR from the bank.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.498
All three were wired
from a company

33:19.598 --> 33:21.100
called Met World Holdings,

33:21.200 --> 33:24.436
which is a shell corp that
traces back to this guy,

33:24.536 --> 33:25.837
Ivan Parsons.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.006
SAM:
That's the same guy
from the storage facility.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.008
He also owns
his own

33:30.109 --> 33:31.710
import-export business
here in L.A.

33:31.810 --> 33:36.182
Looks like they do everything
from fine foods to fine wines.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.716
Which explains
why Alice Morgan said

33:37.816 --> 33:40.186
she saw him at the festival
her husband took her to.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.887
Well, something tells me
his business is doing more

33:41.987 --> 33:44.056
than importing and
exporting food and wine.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.392
He is suspected
of having financial ties

33:46.492 --> 33:50.929
to extremist groups in Ireland,
Germany and Indonesia.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.165
So far, no one's found enough
to prove it.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.733
Well, maybe getting caught
with 25 pounds

33:54.833 --> 33:58.270
of stolen military-grade
explosives will do the trick.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.383
How's that headache now?

34:11.483 --> 34:13.985
I might just take you up
on that single malt after all.

34:14.086 --> 34:17.356
Well, I will interpret
that as being not good.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.659
How are we at locating
Ivan Parsons?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.461
Met World Holdings
owns properties

34:22.561 --> 34:23.562
all throughout the city

34:23.662 --> 34:24.863
but recently applied
for a permit

34:24.963 --> 34:26.532
for an address
in Hollywood.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.167
As always, the city
is backlogged.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.301
So, at the
moment,

34:29.401 --> 34:31.370
that space seems
to be unoccupied.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.472
Hmm. Callen and
Sam on their way?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.706
SAM:
We just got here.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.841
How far out
are Rountree and Deeks?

34:35.941 --> 34:37.743
ROUNTREE:
Deeks stayed behind.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.511
He had to make sure that Alice
Morgan got to a safe location.

34:39.611 --> 34:40.879
I'm seven minutes away.

34:40.979 --> 34:42.481
I don't have to remind you all

34:42.581 --> 34:44.150
what it is we're
dealing with here.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.453
Parsons has enough explosives to
take down an entire city block.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.888
An outcome I would
very much like to avoid.

34:49.988 --> 34:51.890
Talk about avoidance.
Don't start.

34:51.990 --> 34:53.492
Can I stay on
to see how this ends?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.627
It ends, Agent Rountree,

34:55.727 --> 34:58.497
with you recovering all
the missing explosives

34:58.597 --> 35:00.299
without incident.

35:00.399 --> 35:03.202
The only way this city
is going down in flames

35:03.302 --> 35:05.571
is if I'm holding the match.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.182
I got at least one inside.
No sign of Parsons yet.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.717
SHYLA:
Should be another door
around back.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.452
Come on.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.856
* *

35:41.006 --> 35:42.107
CALLEN (quietly):
I got Parsons.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.509
He's in a hurry.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.612
Well, hopefully he has time
for a drink.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.516
(glass shatters)

35:51.317 --> 35:53.219
Yo, check it out.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.529
(grunting)

36:06.765 --> 36:08.967
Come on.
Let's go.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.806
(grunting)

36:19.278 --> 36:20.779
(vehicle approaching)

36:24.683 --> 36:27.719
Parsons, step away
from the van.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.188
Put your
hands up.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.625
All right, turn
towards me slow.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.229
Place the bag on the ground.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.265
Ah, ah-- slowly.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.735
There you go.
Slow...

36:50.709 --> 36:53.078
(grunts, panting)

36:56.181 --> 36:58.684
(grunting)

37:06.992 --> 37:08.226
(indistinct police transmission)

37:08.327 --> 37:09.995
Turns out Morgan had made
a deal with Parsons

37:10.095 --> 37:12.030
but tried to back out
at the last second.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.166
After Parsons had already paid
him almost $30,000.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.469
Oh, so he's either
scared or greedy.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.937
Parsons tracked him down
at his house,

37:19.037 --> 37:20.439
tried to talk him out of it.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.140
We know how that turned out.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.577
I guess Morgan wasn't as
tough as he thought he was.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.779
They never are.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.452
Hey.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.654
Ah. My firstborn.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.323
Your onlyborn.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.924
Well, it's like I said--

37:39.024 --> 37:40.592
I've never cared much for math.
Come on and sit down,

37:40.692 --> 37:41.593
take a load off.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.828
You joining a sorority

37:42.928 --> 37:44.062
or is one of those for me?
Well,

37:44.162 --> 37:46.632
it is now.
(chuckles softly)

37:47.866 --> 37:49.535
How was work today?
(exhales)

37:49.635 --> 37:51.737
Get all the cats
out of the trees?

37:51.837 --> 37:53.539
(chuckles)

37:53.639 --> 37:54.906
(sighs)
Yeah, I...

37:55.006 --> 37:57.108
(chuckles)
I did my best.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.078
Can I ask you a question?

38:00.178 --> 38:01.279
Sure.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.549
I wanted to ask you
a question about Dad.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.552
Oh, honey, you know I don't
like to dwell on my past.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.421
See, that's not fair,
'cause it's our past.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.656
(sighs)

38:10.756 --> 38:13.359
Mm-mmm. Mm.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.095
I just want to know
how you made it through.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.665
Vicodin.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.000
And Sally Jessy Raphael.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.936
Mom.
(chuckles softly)

38:26.004 --> 38:28.907
Oh, how the hell
do I know, honey?

38:30.409 --> 38:33.645
That son of a bitch
sure didn't make it easy on us.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.851
He took everything from us, kid.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.120
Including the person I was.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.123
But because
of you...

38:45.924 --> 38:47.559
...I got her back.

38:47.659 --> 38:52.431
And I told myself I would
never, ever lose her again.

38:54.966 --> 38:58.003
Is the life
I've made for myself, uh...

38:58.103 --> 39:00.606
since then, I don't know,
perfect?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.508
No.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.376
(chuckles)
(chuckles softly)

39:05.677 --> 39:07.779
But it's mine.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.117
I'll drink to that.
You bet.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.753
Yeah.
Hello!

39:14.853 --> 39:16.422
Mm.
Hey.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.423
Hi.
Where were you guys?

39:17.523 --> 39:18.424
At the mall with Tay,

39:18.524 --> 39:19.491
my friend from Calculus.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.959
Kensi picked us up.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.894
KENSI:
Yeah. Um, and, actually,
on the way home,

39:22.994 --> 39:24.896
we were talking about maybe
doing a little road trip

39:24.996 --> 39:26.231
to San Francisco.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.900
It's another place
I've always wanted to visit.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.769
I mean, that's
an amazing idea.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.538
You say the word,
I pack the truck.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.039
(laughs): Oh, Marty.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.675
You're never gonna fit
the four of us in a truck.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.477
Sorry, what?
(laughs)

39:38.577 --> 39:39.711
But the good news is

39:39.811 --> 39:42.047
I know a throuple up in Barstow

39:42.147 --> 39:44.650
that'll rent us an RV
super cheap.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.718
Okay. Yeah.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.986
That's the good news?

39:48.086 --> 39:49.588
Yeah, man.
That you know a throuple?

39:49.688 --> 39:50.989
They have a...

39:51.089 --> 39:52.458
Well, I'm not
a part of it.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.826
Mom, I swear to God.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.163
Kensi?
I'm not. I'm just very good
friends with those ladies.

39:58.263 --> 39:59.330
Mom!

40:00.666 --> 40:02.267
Hey!

40:02.367 --> 40:03.835
Sorry I'm late.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.505
I'll change quickly.
(grunts)

40:06.605 --> 40:08.373
And then we can go to dinner.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.143
Callen, what's going on?

40:13.211 --> 40:15.346
I've decided to change course.

40:16.482 --> 40:17.649
What's in the bag?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.284
Bagels.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.285
As requested.

40:20.385 --> 40:21.386
(laughs)

40:21.487 --> 40:22.754
Okay, I'm confused

40:22.854 --> 40:24.155
and now very hungry.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.525
Well, then I will
make this quick.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.259
Mm-hmm?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.664
I love you.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.933
And I would marry
you tomorrow.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.669
But if we are going
to have a wedding...

40:37.769 --> 40:39.304
we have to do it the right way.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.306
And we need to be
surrounded by...

40:41.406 --> 40:42.974
everyone that means
everything to us.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.177
Our friends. And Arkady.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.413
And Hetty.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.383
You could have
told me that sooner.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.052
And I should've. I...

40:54.152 --> 40:56.522
I've just already made so many
excuses to push off our future.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.289
I-I didn't...

40:58.389 --> 41:00.992
I didn't want to
make her one more.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.295
Sounds like she is one now.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.598
Yeah.

41:06.698 --> 41:07.699
No, you're, uh...

41:07.799 --> 41:09.968
you're right. I...

41:10.836 --> 41:12.671
(sighs)
Look,

41:12.771 --> 41:15.173
as much as I want to fight it...

41:15.974 --> 41:17.408
...Hetty's a huge part
of my life.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.978
She has been there
from the beginning.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.347
I thought I could turn
and just...

41:22.447 --> 41:24.550
we could move on
with our lives, but...

41:24.650 --> 41:26.585
(sighs)
I can't do it.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.486
Callen, why,

41:28.587 --> 41:31.923
after all she's
done, all the lies,

41:32.023 --> 41:33.258
why do you still care?

41:33.358 --> 41:36.361
Because I believe
there's more to the story.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.665
And I need her to tell it.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.267
I need to give her
one more chance to tell it,

41:42.367 --> 41:44.169
from start to finish.
No more...

41:44.269 --> 41:46.337
secrets. No more lies. I...

41:47.472 --> 41:48.674
If I don't do this,

41:48.774 --> 41:51.109
there will always be
another person in the room.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.845
I am not asking
for a lot of time.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.347
Too bad.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.318
'Cause I'm giving it to you.

42:02.487 --> 42:04.590
Callen,

42:04.690 --> 42:06.124
I want to marry you.

42:06.224 --> 42:09.460
And nothing you can say or do
is going to change that.

42:10.461 --> 42:11.529
Anna,

42:11.630 --> 42:12.898
I promise you...

42:13.699 --> 42:14.933
No.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.268
The only thing
I want you to promise

42:17.368 --> 42:19.638
is that you'll keep
being honest with me.

42:20.606 --> 42:21.873
Even when it's hard.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.475
Especially when it's hard.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.078
I will.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.548
Good.
