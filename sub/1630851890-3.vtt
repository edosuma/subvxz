09:27.233 --> 09:32.029
 <i>I'd like to ask you,</i>
<i>do you know Taunja Ann Bennett?</i>

09:32.113 --> 09:34.365
<i>Not-- not</i>
<i>to my recollection, sir.</i>

09:35.324 --> 09:40.121
<i>We have been to your apartment</i>
<i>and retrieved various things,</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:42.039
<i>one of them being a piece of paper</i>

09:42.832 --> 09:46.877
<i>with the name "T. Bennett."</i>

09:47.378 --> 09:48.754
<i>Is that your printing?</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:53.801
<i>I cannot answer that</i>
<i>in full honestness.</i>

10:02.101 --> 10:04.437
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>then once again, I'll ask you,</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:06.147
<i>and this will be the final time I ask you.</i>

10:06.647 --> 10:11.986
<i>Do you have any knowledge</i>
<i>of the death of Taunja Bennett?</i>

10:12.069 --> 10:13.070
<i>No, sir.</i>

13:41.904 --> 13:45.241
<i>I make the above statement</i>
<i>freely and voluntarily.</i>

13:46.283 --> 13:50.246
<i>I have been advised of my rights,</i>
<i>which I understand.</i>

13:56.418 --> 13:59.213
<i>I have seen T. Bennett at JB's truck stop</i>

13:59.296 --> 14:01.131
<i>on several occasions.</i>

14:09.807 --> 14:13.269
<i>The last time</i>
<i>was 21 January, 1990.</i>

14:14.144 --> 14:16.814
<i>I was visiting with Chuck,</i>
<i>who was playing darts.</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:22.444
<i>Later on in the evening, Chuck left,</i>
<i>and T. Bennett left shortly after.</i>

14:31.620 --> 14:34.748
<i>I believe</i>
<i>she left to go to a motel room</i>

14:34.832 --> 14:36.667
<i>to have fun with Chuck.</i>

14:37.835 --> 14:40.963
<i>Later that evening, I saw Chuck</i>
<i>and asked him for a ride home.</i>

14:43.299 --> 14:46.176
<i>I believe I saw a body</i>
<i>in the back of the car.</i>

14:59.189 --> 15:01.775
<i> I got into</i>
<i>the front passenger seat.</i>

15:03.861 --> 15:05.946
<i>The body was wrapped in a blanket.</i>

15:06.530 --> 15:09.533
<i>The body was one of a white female adult.</i>

15:11.368 --> 15:13.037
<i>During this ride home,</i>

15:14.121 --> 15:16.916
<i>the dead female</i>
<i>was in the back of his car.</i>

16:57.433 --> 16:58.475
 <i>Okay.</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:04.565
<i>What happened during</i>
<i>the evening hours of January 21st, 1990?</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:07.526
<i>The phone rang.</i>

17:08.068 --> 17:10.696
<i>It was John Sosnovske calling</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:15.117
<i>to tell me he was in trouble</i>
<i>and to come fast.</i>

17:15.743 --> 17:19.163
<i>And to bring-- bring something large</i>
<i>to wrap something in.</i>

17:20.247 --> 17:21.665
<i>What did you take with you</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:24.877
<i>when you went to see John</i>
<i>at the J&B Lounge?</i>

17:24.960 --> 17:26.795
<i>A blue shower curtain.</i>

17:33.969 --> 17:38.140
<i>When you arrive there,</i>
<i>Laverne, what did you find?</i>

17:40.851 --> 17:41.769
<i>A female.</i>

17:42.811 --> 17:46.398
<i>She was lying, uh, on her side,</i>

17:47.149 --> 17:49.359
<i>very prone, very quiet.</i>

17:50.402 --> 17:52.988
<i>And John Sosnovske came up to the window,</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:54.239
<i>and I asked…</i>

17:55.657 --> 17:56.825
<i>if she's sick.</i>

17:58.410 --> 18:00.412
<i>He says, "Worse than that, she's dead."</i>

18:22.810 --> 18:23.727
<i>I said,</i>

18:24.353 --> 18:28.315
<i>"I think we need</i>
<i>to take her to a hospital."</i>

18:28.899 --> 18:30.526
<i>"We need to report this, John."</i>

18:31.360 --> 18:33.779
<i>He says, "No, no, I'll go to death row."</i>

18:34.446 --> 18:35.697
<i>"You will not do it,</i>

18:36.198 --> 18:38.450
<i>because I will kill you…</i>

18:40.410 --> 18:42.121
<i>and harm your family</i>

18:43.580 --> 18:44.790
<i>and your grandchildren."</i>

19:00.347 --> 19:04.434
<i>He opened the back door</i>
<i>on the passenger side</i>

19:05.435 --> 19:07.563
<i>and pulled her out.</i>

19:07.646 --> 19:10.065
<i>-He went off into the woods…</i>
-

19:10.274 --> 19:13.360
-
<i>-…and he was gone about 15 minutes.</i>

22:22.299 --> 22:26.094
<i>When you drove over</i>
<i>to JB's from your daughter's house</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:28.597
<i>-and you pulled into the lot…</i>
-

22:28.680 --> 22:30.265
<i>…what did you see, if anything?</i>

22:33.643 --> 22:36.563
<i>Um, I seen John standing</i>
<i>with the young lady,</i>

22:38.106 --> 22:43.528
<i>and they appeared</i>
<i>to be arguing… in a… playing way.</i>

23:05.509 --> 23:08.387
<i>He said to her,</i>
<i>"Get in the car, it's cold."</i>

23:08.929 --> 23:11.056
<i>And as you</i>
<i>continue to drive,</i>

23:11.139 --> 23:13.975
<i>there was a point</i>
<i>that Taunja Bennett apparently agreed</i>

23:14.059 --> 23:15.227
<i>to have sex with John.</i>

23:15.310 --> 23:16.561
<i>Yes, she did.</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:27.823
<i>We arrived at Crown Point.</i>
<i>They got out of the car.</i>

23:27.906 --> 23:29.116
<i>I remained in the car.</i>

23:30.158 --> 23:32.994
<i>I understand</i>
<i>that a short period of time went by</i>,

23:33.078 --> 23:34.788
<i>and John came back to the car.</i>

23:34.871 --> 23:36.498
<i>-Is that true?</i>
- <i>That's true.</i>

23:36.581 --> 23:39.793
<i>He went to the trunk,</i>
<i>and there was rope in there.</i>

23:39.876 --> 23:41.962
-
<i>-And he took the rope.</i>

23:42.045 --> 23:45.841
<i>I asked him, "Why do you need the rope?"</i>
<i>He says, "I'm gonna tie her up, it's…</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:48.677
<i>more of a thrill this way."</i>

23:51.138 --> 23:52.055
<i>So…</i>

23:53.098 --> 23:55.434
<i>at that point,</i>
<i>you walked with John to where Taunja was?</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:00.689
<i>Where did you see Taunja?</i>

24:00.772 --> 24:04.818
<i>She was laying in a doorway,</i>
<i>and she was laughing.</i>

24:07.863 --> 24:10.657
<i>He told me to take the rope…</i>

24:13.952 --> 24:14.911
<i>and, uh…</i>

24:16.204 --> 24:17.372
<i>put it around her neck.</i>

24:41.980 --> 24:45.650
<i>What happened then?</i>
<i>Did-- Did John have sex with her?</i>

24:46.359 --> 24:47.194
<i>Yes.</i>

24:47.777 --> 24:50.405
<i>-And I had my eyes shut…</i>
-

24:50.489 --> 24:53.700
<i>…because I knew what he was doing,</i>
<i>and I didn't wanna observe it.</i>

24:53.783 --> 24:55.785
<i>And he kept saying, "Hang on, hang on."</i>

24:57.204 --> 24:59.831
<i>I must have tightened it</i>
<i>as I was hanging on.</i>

25:00.540 --> 25:02.334
<i>He was hitting her in the face.</i>

25:02.417 --> 25:05.253
- <i>What was he hitting her with?</i>
- <i>His fists.</i>

25:06.963 --> 25:07.797
<i>And then…</i>

25:08.632 --> 25:10.383
<i>Then she became limp.</i>

25:17.474 --> 25:21.353
<i>Did you realize</i>
<i>that Taunja Bennett had expired?</i>

25:23.605 --> 25:24.439
<i>Yes.</i>

25:46.253 --> 25:48.547
<i>Ms. Pavlinac,</i>
<i>let me ask you a question.</i>

25:49.047 --> 25:51.675
-
<i>-Do you believe, sitting here today,</i>

25:51.758 --> 25:54.135
<i>that by pulling that rope tight,</i>

25:54.219 --> 25:57.180
<i>that you caused the death</i>
<i>of Taunja Ann Bennett?</i>

26:01.434 --> 26:02.269
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:05.230 --> 26:06.064
<i>You do?</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:09.067
<i> I-- I feel like it's my fault.</i>

32:19.896 --> 32:21.856
<i>Ms. Pavlinac,</i>
<i>let me ask you a question.</i>

32:22.649 --> 32:27.153
<i>Do you believe that,</i>
<i>by pulling that rope tight,</i>

32:27.236 --> 32:30.448
<i>that you caused the death</i>
<i>of Taunja Ann Bennett?</i>

32:31.324 --> 32:32.158
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:32.742 --> 32:35.703
- <i>You do?</i>
<i>-I-- I-- I feel like it's my fault.</i>
