00:08.176 --> 00:10.170
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:10.176 --> 00:13.170
You help me find
Rick. I want to surprise him.

00:13.176 --> 00:14.695
He's at a cabin in Big Bear.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.714
There is no landline,
there's bad reception.

00:16.721 --> 00:19.720
So if he doesn't answer,
don't take it personally.

00:20.056 --> 00:22.056
Where in Big Bear?

00:27.436 --> 00:28.436
Who did this?

00:28.604 --> 00:29.604
Yago's buddies.

00:29.676 --> 00:31.674
Is it over, or are
they coming after you?

00:32.176 --> 00:32.900
Not over.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.795
We'll get a hotel up
north, we'll pay in cash.

00:34.881 --> 00:35.881
I'm not coming with you.

00:35.938 --> 00:37.358
You should both go up
the coast somewhere,

00:37.382 --> 00:39.381
and I'll call you when
I know things are safe.

00:39.461 --> 00:42.111
Brandon isn't putting
this film back into production.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.170
Which means the project really is dead.

00:44.176 --> 00:45.176
The fuck it is.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.206
Jesus!

00:47.239 --> 00:51.367
Miles, why are you bleeding? Miles!

01:06.285 --> 01:08.729
So anyway, there was this woman.

01:08.801 --> 01:11.279
Fuck, what was her name now?
I don't remember what it was.

01:11.285 --> 01:13.615
You seen that film? What's it called?

01:13.758 --> 01:18.425
Here! What's the name of that
actress in Temple of Doom?

01:18.472 --> 01:20.280
Kate Capshaw?

01:20.286 --> 01:22.279
No. The pretty brunette
with the wee tits?

01:22.285 --> 01:25.279
Karen Allen, in the first one.
Temple of Doom was later.

01:25.285 --> 01:28.134
Yes, right. So, see,
when I was his age...

01:28.872 --> 01:32.279
There was this nun at my school.
She looked exactly like Karen Allen.

01:32.285 --> 01:33.653
God, she was lovely.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.279
So, see, when I went to that movie
with Suzie, I found myself blushing

01:36.285 --> 01:40.279
with all of these
feelings of lust and shame.

01:42.285 --> 01:43.280
I thought you knew better.

01:43.286 --> 01:46.279
What's he doing here?
That Loyalist shite.

01:46.285 --> 01:47.280
Come on, lads. Come on. Come on!

01:47.286 --> 01:50.279
Hey, where're you goin'?

01:50.285 --> 01:52.279
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

02:01.285 --> 02:03.285
Here you are, Miles.

02:20.285 --> 02:22.740
- What are you wearing?
- Who shot you?

02:22.764 --> 02:24.280
Why's it so bright?

02:24.286 --> 02:26.285
It's not.

02:26.460 --> 02:27.579
Do you have any painkillers?

02:27.603 --> 02:28.603
Advil. Who shot you?

02:31.603 --> 02:32.598
Miles...

02:32.604 --> 02:36.603
This? No. God, no. No. I, um...

02:38.603 --> 02:40.603
I got clipped by a
golf cart at the studio.

02:41.603 --> 02:43.222
You said you got shot.

02:44.603 --> 02:45.603
When did I say that?

02:46.603 --> 02:48.603
Half an hour ago.

02:51.603 --> 02:52.597
What else did I say?

02:52.603 --> 02:53.598
Not to call an ambulance,

02:53.604 --> 02:55.597
because you were having a nap.

02:55.603 --> 02:58.597
Then I asked what happened,
and you said you got shot.

02:58.603 --> 03:00.597
Must've been dreamin'.

03:00.603 --> 03:02.603
Looks pretty real.

03:04.603 --> 03:07.597
- That my blood?
- It's not mine.

03:07.603 --> 03:09.603
Something must have opened up.

03:10.603 --> 03:12.597
I'll pay to have that cleaned.

03:12.603 --> 03:17.597
I saw this steam cleaner on the shopping
channel. It'll get that right out.

03:17.603 --> 03:21.597
I can get water for you...
Or, you know, vodka works.

03:21.603 --> 03:23.597
So, look,

03:23.603 --> 03:24.598
I don't care about the stain.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.597
I'm worried that you're bleeding.

03:26.603 --> 03:27.598
And when were you
"clipped" by a golf cart?

03:27.604 --> 03:29.597
After you met me at Gravity?

03:29.603 --> 03:31.763
Tell me what you were saying
about the insurance claim.

03:32.182 --> 03:33.704
The studio filed one.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.597
You said that they put expenses
from other films on there.

03:36.603 --> 03:37.603
No, I can't prove that.

03:38.603 --> 03:39.598
Why do you think that?

03:39.604 --> 03:42.597
It's just something I heard
about when I was an assistant.

03:42.603 --> 03:44.597
And then I went to go see the paperwork

03:44.603 --> 03:46.963
for The Admiral's Mistress,
and they wouldn't show it to me.

03:48.603 --> 03:52.597
Give me the details.

03:52.603 --> 03:55.603
Everything you think
has happened, and why.

03:57.603 --> 03:59.597
Darnell. Louis Darnell.

03:59.603 --> 04:03.597
Yeah, I called earlier, they said
he was about to go into surgery.

04:03.603 --> 04:04.598
Do you know if he's out yet?

04:04.604 --> 04:07.597
Hospital policy states that...

04:07.603 --> 04:10.603
Well, can you tell me at
least what kind of surgery?

04:11.603 --> 04:14.603
I am family. I'm his brother.

04:16.603 --> 04:17.598
For...

04:17.603 --> 04:20.603
Can you just tell me
if he's fucking alive?

04:23.603 --> 04:26.603
No. Okay. All right. Thanks anyway.

04:37.603 --> 04:39.597
Don't wait.

04:39.603 --> 04:40.598
You need to call within
the next 30 minutes.

04:40.604 --> 04:43.597
- And we'll include this fabulous total...
- Yes?

04:43.603 --> 04:46.597
It's Miles.

04:46.603 --> 04:47.603
It's who?

04:48.603 --> 04:50.597
Miles Daly.

04:50.603 --> 04:54.597
Sorry for stopping by so late, but
I was hoping we could have a chat.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.597
Fucking Miles is knocking on my door.

05:03.603 --> 05:04.598
At the hotel.

05:04.604 --> 05:08.603
- Amara?
- Yes, right now.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.597
Fuck.

05:18.603 --> 05:21.597
I'm not armed.

05:21.603 --> 05:23.597
I just want you to know, I
can get the movie going again,

05:23.603 --> 05:25.597
and I can get you your money back.

05:25.603 --> 05:28.597
Not what George says.

05:28.603 --> 05:31.603
With all due respect
to George, fuck George.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.603
Come in.

05:46.603 --> 05:48.597
I can turn this thing around, Amara,

05:48.603 --> 05:50.597
as long as nobody else
puts a fucking bullet in me.

05:50.603 --> 05:51.603
Sit.

05:58.928 --> 05:59.928
Okay.

06:01.603 --> 06:02.598
So, it's complicated.

06:02.604 --> 06:05.597
George says all the money is gone.

06:05.603 --> 06:08.603
Money never goes, it just moves around.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.597
Remember, at the beginning,

06:12.603 --> 06:15.597
when you trusted me with all of this?

06:15.603 --> 06:18.603
It was just about cleaning money,

06:19.603 --> 06:21.603
and look how far we got.

06:22.475 --> 06:23.983
Remember?

06:24.047 --> 06:26.597
Sitting behind the monitors
and watching them filming.

06:26.603 --> 06:32.597
All that shit that was in our heads
and it's right there in front of us.

06:32.603 --> 06:34.597
We created that.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.597
Me, and Louis, and you.

06:40.603 --> 06:42.597
What are you even doing?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.598
Just having a chat.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.597
Okay, remember where you were,

06:46.603 --> 06:48.597
and pick it back up
after I fucking kill you.

06:48.603 --> 06:50.597
Amara, you gotta trust me on this.

06:50.603 --> 06:52.597
Tia, where do you wanna
do this, outside?

06:52.603 --> 06:54.603
In the bathroom? I vote bathroom.

06:56.603 --> 06:57.598
- Go get my knife.
- What's happening?

06:57.604 --> 06:59.597
My room. Suitcase. Big fucking knife.

07:13.603 --> 07:15.597
You say trust.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.603
But I don't trust.

07:21.603 --> 07:23.603
So tell me.

07:24.603 --> 07:26.603
How you do this?

07:31.603 --> 07:33.603
I could use a few of your guys.

07:54.603 --> 07:57.603
Well, aren't you a ray of sunshine?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.603
Can I call you an Uber?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.597
Yes?

08:40.602 --> 08:41.597
Messenger.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.602
Come on in.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.603
Don't freak out. Need you
to open that gate again.

09:00.603 --> 09:01.603
Okay.

09:14.603 --> 09:16.603
Some fuckin' view?

09:23.603 --> 09:28.597
Miles? Okay, now I'm confused.

09:28.603 --> 09:29.598
Well, don't worry your
pretty little head.

09:29.604 --> 09:31.597
We're gonna explain everything.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.598
Is this about The Admiral's Mistress?

09:33.605 --> 09:36.597
'Cause... That would be...

09:36.603 --> 09:37.603
What would that be?

09:39.603 --> 09:40.598
This is a prank, right?

09:40.604 --> 09:43.597
I mean, if you want to discuss
what happened with the film,

09:43.603 --> 09:46.597
and how we can move
forward from this point,

09:46.603 --> 09:50.597
- I am more than...
- I'll check the security cameras.

09:50.603 --> 09:53.597
The feed from the cameras goes
directly to the security company.

09:53.603 --> 09:54.603
Does it?

09:58.603 --> 10:01.597
And I have people waiting for me at
the office. If I don't show up, they...

10:01.603 --> 10:04.597
What, you're telling me that
they're gonna send a rescue party?

10:04.603 --> 10:06.597
'Cause that sounds silly.

10:06.603 --> 10:08.597
Give me your cell phone.

10:12.603 --> 10:14.603
Unlock it.

10:18.603 --> 10:19.598
Do you have a calendar app?

10:19.604 --> 10:22.597
There we go.

10:22.603 --> 10:25.597
Your first appointment
isn't until 10:15.

10:25.603 --> 10:28.597
That means you got the whole
morning to relax with us.

10:28.603 --> 10:31.597
Cameras connect to a DVR,
nothing outside the house.

10:31.603 --> 10:34.597
No feed to a security company.

10:34.603 --> 10:37.597
I really thought...

10:37.603 --> 10:41.597
I've been here two minutes, and
you've already lied to me twice.

10:41.603 --> 10:43.597
Is that how you got ahead?

10:43.603 --> 10:45.597
By being a smoothtalking bag of shite?

10:45.603 --> 10:48.597
You shut down a movie, because some
girl has a speck of dust in her eye.

10:48.603 --> 10:51.597
A speck of fuckin' dust!

10:53.603 --> 10:56.597
You want to survive the
next couple of hours?

10:56.603 --> 10:59.597
You should reexamine your
relationship with the truth.

10:59.603 --> 11:00.603
Can you do that for me?

11:01.603 --> 11:03.597
Nod your head!

11:03.603 --> 11:07.597
And I, in return, thank
you for that courtesy.

11:07.603 --> 11:11.597
Let's move this party to
the sofas. You look tired.

11:20.603 --> 11:21.603
Fuck is it?

11:41.603 --> 11:43.597
Whoo! Baby!

11:46.603 --> 11:48.597
Hey! Morning!

11:48.603 --> 11:52.597
Little target practice,
yeah! That looks like fun.

11:52.603 --> 11:54.603
Yeah, it is. You wanna try?

11:56.603 --> 11:59.225
Maybe later.

11:59.603 --> 12:00.603
Okay.

12:04.603 --> 12:06.597
Yeah?

12:06.603 --> 12:07.597
Los Angeles Bureau.

12:07.603 --> 12:08.598
Can you speak with Agent Buchholz?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.603
Yes. Yes, I can do that.

12:12.603 --> 12:16.597
Hello, Rick? Agent Buchholz.
Sorry to bother you.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.598
Okay. Yeah. Don't worry about it.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.597
We have questions
pertaining to a new case.

12:20.603 --> 12:21.598
Can you come in today?

12:21.604 --> 12:22.810
New case?

12:22.913 --> 12:26.602
Yeah, a homicide that occurred
in Nevada while you were there.

12:26.628 --> 12:30.028
You're not a suspect, and we're
not assuming you witnessed anything.

12:30.035 --> 12:33.597
But... you were around Ms. De
Escalones during this time period...

12:33.603 --> 12:35.597
- Okay. So, wait.
- You can help...

12:35.603 --> 12:38.597
You're saying that
Amara's the suspect here?

12:38.603 --> 12:40.597
Who did she kill?

12:40.603 --> 12:42.603
- Let's not get into that.
- Somebody that I know?

12:44.603 --> 12:49.597
You help us, we'll help you.
Can you be here by 2:00 PM.?

12:49.603 --> 12:50.597
Yeah, the address on the card?

12:50.603 --> 12:51.603
That's it.

12:52.603 --> 12:54.597
Is that gunfire?

12:54.603 --> 12:56.597
Yeah. It's just my neighbors.

12:56.603 --> 12:58.731
Okay, so, I'll see you at 2:00 PM then?

12:58.738 --> 12:59.597
See you then.

12:59.603 --> 13:01.597
All right.

13:01.603 --> 13:02.603
Stop it!

13:05.603 --> 13:07.597
Put out your hand.

13:07.603 --> 13:08.598
What, Miles...

13:08.604 --> 13:12.603
Let's just talk. We can
have a productive dialogue.

13:14.603 --> 13:17.597
No, no, no, no! No.
No, no, no! No! No. No!

13:17.603 --> 13:18.470
Maybe we should take a fucking pinky

13:18.477 --> 13:19.597
just to let him know we're serious.

13:19.603 --> 13:21.597
No! No. No, no, no. Don't
do that. Don't do that.

13:21.603 --> 13:24.597
- Are you clear on all of that?
- Yes. Yes.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.003
If there's any funny
business, if Ed even

13:26.010 --> 13:27.597
thinks that there might
be some funny business,

13:27.603 --> 13:30.597
then he is just gonna
snap those cutters shut.

13:30.603 --> 13:32.597
And once you stop crying, and screaming,

13:32.603 --> 13:35.597
and fucking bleeding
everywhere, guess what?

13:35.603 --> 13:37.597
We're just gonna try again.

13:37.603 --> 13:39.597
Okay. I got it. I got it.

13:39.603 --> 13:43.597
Just be your normal,
cheery, stupid self.

13:46.603 --> 13:47.598
Brandon Fisher's office.

13:47.604 --> 13:49.597
Debra! Hi.

13:49.603 --> 13:50.598
Good morning!

13:50.604 --> 13:52.597
Good morning to you, too.

13:52.603 --> 13:57.597
Would you do me a favor and
cancel my appointments for today.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.598
Everything all right?

13:58.604 --> 14:00.597
Everything is fantastic.

14:00.603 --> 14:02.597
Okay. Will do.

14:02.603 --> 14:04.597
And, Debra, we need driveon passes

14:04.603 --> 14:06.597
for three gentlemen on
their way to accounting.

14:06.603 --> 14:08.597
Can you give me their names?

14:11.603 --> 14:13.597
Hello. This is Accounting.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.597
This is Brandon Fisher.

14:15.603 --> 14:17.597
My God. Hello.

14:17.603 --> 14:19.597
There are three accountants
on their way in,

14:19.603 --> 14:24.597
they will need copies of
insurance and budget records.

14:24.603 --> 14:26.597
Can you make sure they
get everything they need?

14:26.603 --> 14:28.597
Yes. Absolutely.

14:28.603 --> 14:29.598
What's your name?

14:29.604 --> 14:31.597
I'm Robert.

14:31.603 --> 14:34.597
I know how hard you guys work
down there in accounting, Robert.

14:34.603 --> 14:38.597
So, on behalf of all of us, thank you.

14:38.603 --> 14:42.597
Thank you. So much for...

14:42.603 --> 14:47.603
Okay. So, we should leave
at noon for the whale watch.

14:48.603 --> 14:50.597
Well, don't look too excited.

14:50.603 --> 14:54.603
It sounds cool... It's just,
yesterday was the first I heard of it.

14:57.603 --> 15:01.603
Well, we should get food.
I'll, I'll grab menus.

15:02.603 --> 15:04.603
Do you have sun stuff?

15:08.603 --> 15:11.597
Can I get a couple of menus? Thank you.

15:11.603 --> 15:12.603
Yeah.

15:14.603 --> 15:16.603
And they have fresh watermelon juice.

15:34.603 --> 15:35.603
You own a gun.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.597
That is real.

15:39.603 --> 15:41.597
Legally registered.

15:41.603 --> 15:44.597
You do not touch it, and you sure as
hell do not bring it out in public.

15:44.603 --> 15:47.597
But where did you get it?
Did Dad give it to you?

15:47.603 --> 15:49.597
Yes. Okay, years ago...

15:49.603 --> 15:50.643
Do you know how to use it?

15:51.603 --> 15:52.603
Of course.

15:55.603 --> 15:57.597
Look, I...

15:57.603 --> 15:59.603
I never told you before, because,

16:00.603 --> 16:04.597
well, mostly, because I don't
like the idea of having it.

16:04.603 --> 16:05.923
Then why is it in your beach bag?

16:09.603 --> 16:10.597
Protection.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.603
What?

16:13.603 --> 16:14.598
Look, we're traveling alone.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.597
So every time we travel
alone, you carry a gun.

16:16.603 --> 16:18.597
I can't leave it in the hotel
room. I mean, the maid...

16:18.603 --> 16:20.597
- Tell me what's going on.
- I am.

16:20.603 --> 16:21.598
- Mom...
- Look, I'm telling you...

16:21.604 --> 16:23.603
No! No, you're fucking not!

16:24.603 --> 16:25.598
Language.

16:25.604 --> 16:27.603
Can I have the key?

16:29.603 --> 16:31.597
Look, Emma...

16:31.603 --> 16:33.603
No, I want to go back to the room.

16:37.603 --> 16:38.603
'Course.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.603
Fuck!

16:46.603 --> 16:48.603
George is on the studio lot.

16:49.603 --> 16:51.597
Fucking...

16:51.603 --> 16:55.603
Brandon, no offense, but your
DVD collection is utter shite.

16:56.603 --> 16:58.597
I mean... Ooh.

16:58.603 --> 17:02.597
Rascals Island, Captain Impossible,

17:02.603 --> 17:05.597
Captain Impossible Two. Thank God.

17:05.603 --> 17:07.597
- Did you make these?
- I did.

17:07.603 --> 17:09.597
They make lots of money?

17:09.603 --> 17:11.597
Rascals Island was a bit of a misstep.

17:11.603 --> 17:13.603
Although it did convert in China, so...

17:16.603 --> 17:18.597
Do you even like movies?

17:18.603 --> 17:21.597
How'd you end up in the movie business?

17:21.603 --> 17:22.603
I'm serious.

17:24.603 --> 17:28.597
I got an MBA at Wharton Business School.

17:28.603 --> 17:30.597
And I was good with
people, good with numbers.

17:30.603 --> 17:33.603
Why not go out to Wall
Street, or Silicon Valley?

17:34.603 --> 17:37.597
I like the lifestyle.

17:39.603 --> 17:41.597
But it's just a numbers game.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.597
Have you ever been swept away by a film?

17:44.603 --> 17:45.598
Ever been transported by its...

17:45.604 --> 17:47.597
Do you even know what I'm talking about?

17:47.603 --> 17:50.597
It has occurred to me

17:50.603 --> 17:52.597
since I've had this job, that I have

17:52.603 --> 17:55.597
been less focused on my
own experience of a film,

17:55.603 --> 17:59.597
and more on what gets other
people to go to the movies.

18:06.603 --> 18:08.597
Hey.

18:08.603 --> 18:09.598
Is it safe to come back yet?

18:09.604 --> 18:12.597
Um... Soon.

18:12.603 --> 18:15.597
Hopefully. Did
you call the hospital?

18:15.603 --> 18:16.598
Spoke with the ward nurse.

18:16.604 --> 18:19.597
Louis was in surgery, that's
all they could tell me.

18:19.603 --> 18:21.597
Also, I, um...

18:21.603 --> 18:23.597
I brought the .38 with me.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.597
Good.

18:25.603 --> 18:30.597
Had it in my bag, and
Emma just found it.

18:30.603 --> 18:33.597
No. For...

18:33.603 --> 18:35.597
Yeah. She's back in the room.

18:35.603 --> 18:38.597
I have to tell her
something. What do I say?

18:38.603 --> 18:40.597
Tell her...

18:40.603 --> 18:42.597
Can it wait till I get there?

18:42.603 --> 18:45.597
I don't think so. Miles, she
knows something's going on.

18:45.603 --> 18:47.597
You can't level with
her, Katie, she's 12.

18:47.603 --> 18:49.444
She shouldn't have to
deal with this shit.

18:50.603 --> 18:53.597
Look, I won't go into the details.

18:53.603 --> 18:54.598
I'll call you after I talk to her.

18:54.604 --> 18:57.603
Hold on. Katie?

19:08.603 --> 19:10.597
What is this?

19:10.603 --> 19:13.597
It's, coldpressed
spinachgingerbeet juice.

19:13.603 --> 19:15.597
What's coldpressed?

19:15.603 --> 19:17.597
It's when the juice
is extracted via pressure

19:17.603 --> 19:20.603
instead of centrifuge, or shredder.

19:22.603 --> 19:26.597
You want to try some, there
are pouches in the fridge.

19:26.603 --> 19:28.597
Just grab one, throw it in
the Juicero machine there,

19:28.603 --> 19:30.597
and, hit the button.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.603
Juicero?

19:33.603 --> 19:35.603
I don't care.

19:43.603 --> 19:44.598
Hey...

19:44.604 --> 19:47.597
Hate to be that guy, but, um,

19:47.603 --> 19:49.603
I could use a trip to the restroom?

19:56.603 --> 19:58.597
Excuse me.

19:58.603 --> 19:59.603
Did you play football?

20:00.603 --> 20:01.637
I don't know,

20:01.668 --> 20:05.597
you just seem like an athlete.

20:05.603 --> 20:07.597
Busted my leg, had to stop.

20:07.603 --> 20:12.597
Right. Right. Yeah. It's old story.

20:12.603 --> 20:15.603
No, I just notice you've
a very interesting look.

20:17.603 --> 20:19.523
Have you ever thought about acting?

20:28.603 --> 20:31.603
Yo, man, why are you
mixed up in this nonsense?

20:33.603 --> 20:35.597
For real, brother to brother...

20:35.603 --> 20:37.597
What's that?

20:37.603 --> 20:40.597
No, I was just... You know...

20:40.603 --> 20:42.597
Okay, you know what? Let's
not make this about race.

20:42.603 --> 20:45.597
Hey. Watch him.

20:45.603 --> 20:48.603
And if he opens his
mouth again, shoot him.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.597
No.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.597
Okay. Come on. Come on. Okay. Come on.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.603
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:48.603 --> 21:49.603
Okay!

21:53.603 --> 21:55.597
The... Fucking burn!

22:00.603 --> 22:03.597
Hey. You got no right
to drive on that road.

22:03.603 --> 22:04.598
What?

22:04.604 --> 22:06.597
This is a private road.

22:06.603 --> 22:09.597
The owner of this cabin knows
that this road is offlimits.

22:09.603 --> 22:11.597
You come driving 35, 40 miles an hour!

22:11.603 --> 22:13.603
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

22:16.603 --> 22:17.598
Say that again?

22:17.604 --> 22:19.597
I said why don't you
go drink some moonshine,

22:19.603 --> 22:21.603
fuck your sister, and leave us alone?

22:29.603 --> 22:32.597
What are you, some kind of Mexican?

22:32.603 --> 22:34.711
How about I kick your spic ass back

22:34.718 --> 22:37.597
across the border?
Is that what you want?

22:37.603 --> 22:39.597
No one here's Mexican, you cracker fuck.

22:53.603 --> 22:54.603
Hey.

22:57.087 --> 22:59.086
Your house?

22:59.603 --> 23:02.603
No. This... It's my dad's. Yeah.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.301
Not very nice.

23:05.604 --> 23:08.597
I know. It could use some work.

23:08.603 --> 23:09.603
Don't come here a lot.

23:14.603 --> 23:15.603
Why you run away?

23:20.603 --> 23:22.603
I don't know.

23:34.603 --> 23:36.603
Why you afraid of me?

23:37.603 --> 23:38.598
Someone tell you to be afraid?

23:38.604 --> 23:40.603
What, no...

23:50.603 --> 23:52.603
No, I'm... I just...

23:53.603 --> 23:55.597
I felt really guilty.

23:55.603 --> 23:59.597
I lost your whole investment.

24:01.603 --> 24:03.597
My movie shut down,

24:03.603 --> 24:06.603
then you go away. Made me sad.

24:09.603 --> 24:11.603
I don't like to feel sad.

24:13.603 --> 24:15.603
Yeah I...

24:18.603 --> 24:19.603
I get that.

24:25.603 --> 24:28.597
Hey, you know what my
Tia told me last night?

24:28.603 --> 24:31.597
That if the movie does okay,
she'll invest in another.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.597
Hell, no.

24:33.603 --> 24:35.443
- I was like, are you kidding?
- You said that?

24:35.483 --> 24:37.603
To myself.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.564
And you were supposed to take
care of this shit a long time ago.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.597
Until you said back off.

24:44.603 --> 24:46.597
Look at this arm, homie.

24:46.603 --> 24:49.597
I want him as bad as you.

24:49.603 --> 24:51.603
What I say? Here he is.

24:59.603 --> 25:00.603
What's up, son?

25:08.603 --> 25:12.603
Yago, Doll A Menu. This is good people.

25:14.604 --> 25:16.603
Your name is Dollar Menu?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.009
"Doll A."

25:19.057 --> 25:22.603
Hooked him up with the
address, got him a picture of Miles.

25:33.603 --> 25:36.603
The rest when it's done.
Bliz'll tell you when.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.971
Why you gotta wait?

25:39.051 --> 25:40.603
Timing.

25:42.603 --> 25:45.985
My aunt has money tied
up with this puta.

25:46.603 --> 25:49.597
Hey, yo. Can you make
it look like an OD?

25:49.603 --> 25:52.597
Or, like, he got mixed
up in some LA shit?

25:52.603 --> 25:54.603
It can't come back on us.

25:56.603 --> 25:59.597
- I can do that.
- Yeah. Word.

26:04.603 --> 26:07.597
Pretty much sums up California.

26:07.603 --> 26:10.597
Fresh juice, beautiful
house, sun streaming through.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.603
But underneath it's all rotten.

26:14.603 --> 26:16.603
Actually that's fuckin' delicious.

26:20.603 --> 26:21.883
You think I could be in a movie?

26:23.603 --> 26:25.597
My whole life I've been
watching fools in these scenes,

26:25.603 --> 26:27.603
they hold the gun wrong.

26:29.603 --> 26:31.597
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

26:31.603 --> 26:33.597
if that was something
you wanted to pursue, Ed.

26:33.603 --> 26:35.603
Since you already
know how to hold a gun.

26:39.603 --> 26:43.603
I was sure Amara was gonna let Yago
put a bullet in me, last night, man.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.597
Her and Yago haven't been getting along.

26:47.603 --> 26:51.603
Why's that? Come on, you can tell me.

26:54.603 --> 26:56.603
He's been slingin' in LA.

26:57.603 --> 26:58.598
Yago's selling coke here?

26:58.604 --> 27:00.603
Does Mexico know about that?

27:01.603 --> 27:03.597
Shit.

27:03.603 --> 27:07.597
Him and his band of merry gobshites.

27:07.603 --> 27:11.597
The more Amara backs you, the
more you need to watch yourself.

27:11.603 --> 27:12.598
No, she's on my side, now.

27:12.604 --> 27:14.597
Yago's not gonna ask Amara.

27:14.603 --> 27:16.597
He'll have someone else do it.

27:16.603 --> 27:19.597
Who, Bliz?

27:19.603 --> 27:20.603
He had his chance.

27:25.603 --> 27:26.603
Damn.

27:33.603 --> 27:34.598
Hi, there.

27:34.604 --> 27:38.597
Good morning. I'm George. This is Sammy.

27:38.603 --> 27:40.603
Hi.

27:41.603 --> 27:42.598
- And Olly.
- "Olly?"

27:42.604 --> 27:46.597
We refer to him as "Olly," the
name on his license is "Oliver."

27:46.603 --> 27:49.597
I believe someone called
to say we were coming.

27:49.603 --> 27:50.598
Yes. Brandon Fisher called.

27:50.604 --> 27:52.597
He told you we'd be
requesting documents?

27:52.603 --> 27:54.597
Yes. Yes, sir.

27:54.603 --> 27:57.597
There's a complete list. I need you
to pull originals, also make copies.

27:57.603 --> 27:59.597
Okay, perfect. I'll just get my boss.

27:59.603 --> 28:01.597
Hold on.

28:01.603 --> 28:04.597
I was told the only clearance
you'd need was from Mr. Fisher.

28:04.603 --> 28:06.597
Yeah, totally, he's the president.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.597
I just know my boss, she likes
to oversee this kind of stuff.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.597
- What's your name?
- Robert.

28:10.603 --> 28:13.603
Robert, we'd prefer
you handle this alone.

28:17.603 --> 28:19.597
I'll just call her.

28:22.603 --> 28:23.598
You need another
call from the president

28:23.604 --> 28:25.603
of the studio to put you at ease?

28:26.603 --> 28:28.597
I'm okay.

28:28.603 --> 28:30.603
Then we prefer you handle this alone.

28:32.594 --> 28:35.209
So if all you care about is
how much money a movie makes...

28:35.249 --> 28:36.202
Not exactly what I said.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.597
You said that was your focus.

28:37.603 --> 28:39.597
I'm guessing that you didn't think

28:39.603 --> 28:42.597
that people were go and wanna
see The Admiral's Mistress.

28:42.603 --> 28:44.597
I wasn't sure.

28:44.603 --> 28:47.603
Don't stop the flow,
let's get this over with.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.597
So what? You didn't like the story?

28:50.603 --> 28:52.963
No, the story was fine. I just
wasn't sure about the ending.

28:54.603 --> 28:56.603
You know, someone else said that.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.597
And the writer wrote a different ending.

28:59.603 --> 29:03.597
Where Felton survives, and
Margaret goes and finds him.

29:03.603 --> 29:04.598
See, that, I like.

29:04.604 --> 29:06.597
Fuck, I don't know.

29:08.009 --> 29:11.088
Yeah, the original ending is a bit
of a downer. But at least it's real.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.611
Well, real life has happy
endings, too, doesn't it?

29:20.603 --> 29:24.597
How'd you get interested in movies?

29:24.603 --> 29:26.597
Growing up in Ireland,
we moved around a lot.

29:26.603 --> 29:30.597
I supp... You know what? I'm not
gonna tell you my fucking life story.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.603
That is fine.

29:37.603 --> 29:40.597
As kids we lived in Northern Ireland.

29:40.603 --> 29:41.598
During the Troubles.

29:41.604 --> 29:43.603
Saw some ugly shit.

29:45.603 --> 29:47.355
My uncle used to bring me to the cinema,

29:47.378 --> 29:50.603
and this one time we were
going to some '80s comedy.

29:53.603 --> 29:56.597
We're waiting for the movie to start
and this bunch of Loyalists came in,

29:56.603 --> 29:59.597
and they had it in
against my uncle. Ooh.

29:59.603 --> 30:00.598
They saw him and I thought,

30:00.604 --> 30:03.603
"They're gonna fucking
kill us both, right here."

30:06.284 --> 30:09.597
And they just walked
past to their seats.

30:09.603 --> 30:12.603
'Cause no one wanted to go
at each other in the movies.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.597
Safer than a church, really.

30:16.603 --> 30:21.603
People wanted to lose themselves
and forget the mess outside.

30:23.603 --> 30:24.603
There's a happy ending.

30:26.603 --> 30:31.597
Couple of weeks later, someone
stuck a knife in Eamon's heart.

30:31.603 --> 30:34.603
Same guys, different guys, I
don't know. It doesn't matter.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.597
But the last thing I
remember of my uncle,

30:39.603 --> 30:42.597
he was laughing his ass
off at Steve Martin.

30:45.603 --> 30:46.603
We all were.

31:05.603 --> 31:06.603
Now I'm hungry.

31:11.603 --> 31:15.597
There are things me
and Dad don't tell you.

31:15.603 --> 31:17.603
Not because we don't trust you.

31:19.603 --> 31:24.603
We sometimes think it's better
not to bring you into it.

31:30.603 --> 31:32.603
I bought a gun, because...

31:33.603 --> 31:36.603
Because I'm scared of
some people Dad knows.

31:38.603 --> 31:40.007
What people?

31:40.047 --> 31:41.047
From Nevada.

31:43.603 --> 31:45.597
I just talked to Dad.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.603
We're okay...

31:50.603 --> 31:53.603
But this morning, I was scared.

31:55.603 --> 31:56.603
That how he got hurt?

31:58.603 --> 31:59.603
He was in a fight.

32:00.603 --> 32:02.603
You call the police?

32:03.603 --> 32:05.597
We can't mention this to anyone,

32:05.603 --> 32:07.603
definitely not the police.

32:08.603 --> 32:09.603
Why?

32:11.603 --> 32:14.597
Because he could get in trouble.

32:14.603 --> 32:16.603
For what?

32:19.603 --> 32:23.603
Look, most of what you want to
know, you gonna have to ask Dad.

32:25.603 --> 32:27.603
And I guess he'll, um,

32:29.251 --> 32:30.603
he'll tell you what he can.

32:38.746 --> 32:39.746
Juice?

32:40.372 --> 32:41.372
Thanks.

32:44.603 --> 32:45.598
What is that, beets?

32:45.604 --> 32:47.603
Sweet roots. That's my favorite so far.

32:48.603 --> 32:49.598
George.

32:49.604 --> 32:52.597
I have the documents.

32:52.603 --> 32:55.597
Okay, hang on. I'm just
gonna put you on speakerphone,

32:55.603 --> 32:57.603
so our host can hear
what you have to tell us.

33:04.603 --> 33:06.597
Shoot.

33:06.603 --> 33:08.597
I have before me an insurance claim

33:08.603 --> 33:10.597
submitted by Gravity International,

33:10.603 --> 33:12.597
to obtain reimbursement
for expenses incurred

33:12.603 --> 33:15.597
during production of
"The Admiral's Mistress".

33:15.603 --> 33:17.597
Nearly two million
dollars of these expenses

33:17.603 --> 33:20.597
do not appear on the
original film budget.

33:20.603 --> 33:24.597
They appear on the budget for a
different movie, Lethal Limit Four.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.597
And receipts were billed to this film.

33:27.603 --> 33:29.597
And what would that be
called in a court of law?

33:29.603 --> 33:32.597
Proof of felony insurance fraud.

33:34.603 --> 33:36.597
And who signed that claim?

33:36.603 --> 33:38.597
Budget and claim paperwork

33:38.603 --> 33:42.597
were signed by the President of Gravity
International, Brandon Fisher. Also...

33:42.603 --> 33:43.598
There's more?

33:43.604 --> 33:46.597
Were a forensic accountant
to examine the records here,

33:46.603 --> 33:51.597
I suspect this type of fraud would
prove to be pervasive and ongoing

33:51.603 --> 33:52.598
at Gravity International.

33:52.604 --> 33:57.603
Pervasive and ongoing.
Holy shit! Thanks, George.

34:02.603 --> 34:04.597
A longwinded way of saying,

34:04.603 --> 34:07.603
do what we tell you, or you are fucked.

34:11.603 --> 34:13.603
No..

34:53.603 --> 34:56.603
Everything okay?

34:59.603 --> 35:00.603
No.

35:10.603 --> 35:12.603
Anything I can do?

35:14.603 --> 35:16.603
Are you afraid of me, Ricky?

35:19.603 --> 35:21.603
Yeah. Yeah.

35:23.603 --> 35:25.597
I mean... I mean, come on.

35:25.603 --> 35:27.603
Look at those guys.

35:29.603 --> 35:33.603
You're capable of resorting to...

35:35.603 --> 35:38.597
I'm gonna say, extreme tactics.

35:38.603 --> 35:41.597
No judgment.

35:41.603 --> 35:45.603
That's apparently, that's the
way it is in the casino business.

35:48.603 --> 35:50.597
But you put money into our film

35:50.603 --> 35:52.603
and it went to shit.

35:54.603 --> 35:56.603
However,

35:57.603 --> 36:00.603
when I saw you come
through that door today.

36:02.603 --> 36:03.603
I thought...

36:06.603 --> 36:07.603
Partly I was scared.

36:11.603 --> 36:12.603
But I also thought...

36:16.603 --> 36:17.603
"Holy shit,"

36:18.603 --> 36:20.603
"I am crazy about this woman."

36:21.603 --> 36:24.603
"I'm totally crazy about her."

36:28.603 --> 36:30.603
"What the hell took
her so long to find me?"

37:10.603 --> 37:11.603
Ricky.

37:12.603 --> 37:14.597
Come on.

37:14.603 --> 37:16.597
Good night.

37:16.603 --> 37:17.603
Good night.

37:18.603 --> 37:19.603
Good night.

37:23.603 --> 37:25.603
Come to bed.

37:58.602 --> 38:01.596
Well, I don't know,
was it just me, or...

38:01.603 --> 38:03.597
was that a blueribbon evening?

38:03.603 --> 38:06.597
Not much sleep.

38:06.603 --> 38:09.597
No, like a couple of teenagers.

38:11.603 --> 38:13.597
Put your things in my car.

38:13.603 --> 38:15.597
Well, I got to take the rental back.

38:15.603 --> 38:19.597
Clipper can take that
car. You come with me.

38:19.603 --> 38:21.597
Okay. Yeah, sure.

38:21.603 --> 38:24.603
Give me the keys. Clipper!

38:29.603 --> 38:33.597
Hey! What are you doing up
here? You got loose?

38:33.603 --> 38:36.597
Okay. Aw, I'm your friend
now all of a sudden?

38:36.603 --> 38:40.597
All right, come on, come on. You
got to go back. Come on, buddy.

38:40.603 --> 38:41.603
Come on. Jim!

38:44.603 --> 38:45.603
Hey, Jim!

38:46.285 --> 38:47.603
Found somebody...

38:59.603 --> 39:01.603
Ricky. Let's go.

39:15.603 --> 39:16.603
Brandon.

39:18.603 --> 39:19.598
Morning, April.

39:19.604 --> 39:21.597
Heard some exciting news.

39:21.603 --> 39:23.597
Staff nature retreat?

39:23.603 --> 39:27.597
No, I heard you're putting The
Admiral's Mistress back into production.

39:27.603 --> 39:28.603
Exciting.

39:30.603 --> 39:32.031
Isn't it?

39:32.071 --> 39:34.598
And surprising. Considering
the day before yesterday,

39:34.603 --> 39:36.597
you said it was totally dead.

39:36.603 --> 39:38.597
Always thought it had potential.

39:38.603 --> 39:40.597
And with the revised ending, yeah...

39:40.603 --> 39:42.603
Re... Revised ending?

39:43.603 --> 39:45.603
Miles pitched it, actually.

39:46.603 --> 39:48.597
When?

39:48.603 --> 39:51.597
You know I've been thinking about this,

39:51.603 --> 39:54.603
and I would rather you
didn't split your focus.

39:55.603 --> 39:58.597
So you're saying that
I'm not on the movie?

39:58.603 --> 40:01.597
Captain Impossible is a huge enterprise.

40:01.603 --> 40:03.597
- So I have to choose?
- No, no.

40:03.603 --> 40:05.597
Thank you.

40:05.603 --> 40:08.364
You're on Captain Impossible.
I've put Reed Jennings on the other one.

40:09.603 --> 40:11.168
I thought Reed was an assistant.

40:11.603 --> 40:12.603
Not anymore.

40:20.603 --> 40:23.603
Yeah. So, hold on, so what's it called?

40:25.603 --> 40:27.597
My garment.

40:27.603 --> 40:30.597
Right. But really, it's underwear.

40:30.603 --> 40:32.597
At the ch... You get it from the church.

40:32.603 --> 40:34.597
You buy it through the church.

40:34.603 --> 40:36.597
You know when we hit
the road from Nevada?

40:36.603 --> 40:41.597
I left everything behind,
including my garments.

40:41.603 --> 40:43.597
And the next day we went to MGM,

40:43.603 --> 40:48.243
and I didn't have
anything clean to wear,

40:48.282 --> 40:50.597
so I went commando.

40:50.603 --> 40:53.597
I never do that.

40:53.603 --> 40:55.597
You went commando at MGM?

40:55.603 --> 40:58.597
I knew that it was a bad idea.

40:58.603 --> 41:00.597
It was a big mistake.

41:00.603 --> 41:02.597
You think maybe you got shot
because you weren't wearing

41:02.603 --> 41:03.598
your magic underpants?

41:03.604 --> 41:05.597
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:05.603 --> 41:08.597
You want me to go and get
them for you? I can do that.

41:08.603 --> 41:10.597
I'm not going to touch them,

41:10.603 --> 41:13.597
but I will bring some kind of tongs

41:13.604 --> 41:14.945
and I shall deliver them to you.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.015
Hello.

41:16.136 --> 41:19.597
Why, hello. How are you feeling?

41:19.603 --> 41:21.597
High...

41:21.603 --> 41:23.597
Yeah. For a guy who's never
had caffeine or alcohol,

41:23.603 --> 41:24.598
what's it like to be on morphine?

41:24.604 --> 41:28.597
Like the Angel Moroni.

41:28.603 --> 41:31.597
Yeah, the big pair of
wings, just flying around.

41:31.603 --> 41:34.597
Who needs magic underpants
when you've got opiates?

41:34.603 --> 41:35.603
Sorry.

41:39.603 --> 41:42.305
Hi, I'm in a hospital. I'm not

41:42.328 --> 41:43.597
really supposed to be on a cell phone.

41:43.603 --> 41:44.643
Why are you in a hospital?

41:45.603 --> 41:47.597
Um, annual colonoscopy.

41:47.603 --> 41:49.597
Doesn't matter.

41:49.603 --> 41:52.597
I'm calling to say congratulations
on The Admiral's Mistress.

41:52.603 --> 41:54.597
And that I want to be involved.

41:54.603 --> 41:57.597
- Wonderful.
- No, I'm saying, I'm not involved,

41:57.603 --> 41:59.597
but I'm hoping you'll change that.

41:59.603 --> 42:01.597
- Isn't that Brandon's call?
- One would think.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.597
But I know you spoke to Brandon,

42:03.603 --> 42:04.923
and suddenly the movie's back on.

42:06.603 --> 42:08.597
Isn't that something?

42:08.603 --> 42:11.603
Last time you and I spoke, we
discussed the insurance claim.

42:12.603 --> 42:14.597
What are you getting at?

42:14.603 --> 42:17.597
I'm just wondering if you used
the same method of persuasion

42:17.603 --> 42:20.597
with Brandon that you used with me.

42:20.603 --> 42:22.603
Probably wouldn't want that getting out.

42:24.603 --> 42:26.603
April, are you blackmailing me?

42:27.603 --> 42:29.597
I am very impressed.

42:29.603 --> 42:33.603
I look forward to our collaboration.

42:45.603 --> 42:46.603
Talk.

42:50.603 --> 42:52.603
How's Louis?

42:54.603 --> 42:57.603
On the mend. Thank you for asking.

42:58.603 --> 42:59.603
That's good.

43:01.603 --> 43:03.603
I feel bad about what went down.

43:04.603 --> 43:06.597
That's nice to hear.

43:06.603 --> 43:09.603
Hope you know, it's nothing personal.

43:11.603 --> 43:13.603
I'm sure you feel the same way, right?

43:17.253 --> 43:18.253
Sure.

43:18.604 --> 43:20.597
I told my Tia, me and Miles,

43:20.603 --> 43:22.597
we can put this shit behind us.

43:22.603 --> 43:25.603
We're businessmen, it was just business.

43:27.603 --> 43:29.603
That's exactly how I feel.

43:32.603 --> 43:33.643
You two need to get along.

43:37.603 --> 43:40.597
- Miles?
- Of course.

43:40.603 --> 43:43.603
- Yago?
- Yeah.

43:44.603 --> 43:46.603
You tell him I'm going to Nevada?

43:48.603 --> 43:50.597
I need someone there.

43:50.603 --> 43:51.603
At the casino?

43:52.603 --> 43:54.603
That's great.

43:58.603 --> 44:01.597
You know, I was talking to my Tia.

44:01.603 --> 44:04.597
It really is a good idea.
The whole movie shit.

44:04.603 --> 44:06.603
Yeah.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.597
It's really gonna pay off.

44:10.604 --> 44:14.597
And I can't wait to
see how it turns out.

44:14.603 --> 44:16.280
You're gonna fucking love it.

44:16.603 --> 44:18.603
I will.

44:21.603 --> 44:23.603
So break a leg.

44:24.603 --> 44:25.993
Isn't that what they say?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
That is what they say.

44:40.603 --> 44:41.603
Come in.

44:45.603 --> 44:47.603
I hear you have questions.

44:59.603 --> 45:00.978
Who'd you get into a fight with?

45:04.603 --> 45:06.603
Some people I knew in Pahrump.

45:08.603 --> 45:10.597
Their names really don't matter.

45:10.603 --> 45:12.603
People you worked with?

45:13.603 --> 45:14.603
Yeah.

45:17.603 --> 45:18.603
What was the fight about?

45:19.110 --> 45:20.110
Money...

45:21.603 --> 45:23.603
I suppose.

45:26.603 --> 45:28.597
And you didn't tell the police,

45:28.603 --> 45:30.603
'cause you could get in trouble?

45:39.603 --> 45:41.603
Why we came out to LA?

45:43.603 --> 45:45.603
To change that part of my life.

45:48.499 --> 45:49.493
Are you selling drugs?

45:49.499 --> 45:50.493
No.

45:50.499 --> 45:51.494
Were you...

45:51.500 --> 45:54.499
Don't ask those kind of questions, okay?

46:01.499 --> 46:03.499
Did you get shot?

46:05.499 --> 46:06.499
Or stabbed or something?

46:11.498 --> 46:13.854
I'm okay now.

46:14.499 --> 46:15.968
You're not gonna talk
about that, either.

46:15.975 --> 46:16.493
All right.

46:16.499 --> 46:19.499
Well, can I see it?

46:20.499 --> 46:21.499
Yeah.

46:29.499 --> 46:32.499
Have you always worked
with people like this?

46:34.499 --> 46:35.499
For a while, now.

46:48.499 --> 46:50.499
So you've been lying to me,

46:51.499 --> 46:53.499
basically my whole life.

46:57.499 --> 47:01.499
I love you more than
anything in this world.

47:03.499 --> 47:04.499
But, yeah.

47:33.499 --> 47:35.499
I was thinking about Rusty.

47:37.499 --> 47:39.499
What about him?

47:41.499 --> 47:44.493
You got stitches after he bit you.

47:44.499 --> 47:46.493
You made all kinds of excuses for him.

47:46.499 --> 47:49.493
I stole his favorite stick.

47:49.499 --> 47:51.499
For a dog, that's a pretty good excuse.

47:53.499 --> 47:54.499
But then he bit Emma.

47:55.499 --> 47:58.493
Not badly.

47:58.499 --> 48:02.499
You drove off with him. I thought
you were giving him away...

48:04.499 --> 48:06.499
I found out you shot him.

48:08.499 --> 48:11.499
When you loved him more than anyone.

48:14.499 --> 48:16.493
Because you were protecting Emma.

48:16.499 --> 48:17.499
But we're not in danger.

48:19.499 --> 48:22.493
We're not. Katie, Amara's happy.

48:22.499 --> 48:23.494
Her investment is back on track.

48:23.500 --> 48:26.493
We're setting up that shell
company like you suggested,

48:26.499 --> 48:28.499
- so good thinking on your part.
- Miles...

48:33.499 --> 48:35.499
Yeah?

48:38.499 --> 48:41.493
I wanted this to work.

48:41.499 --> 48:42.494
- I really did.
- I know.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.499
- If it was just me...
- Yeah?

48:49.499 --> 48:51.499
I need you to stay away from us.

48:54.499 --> 48:57.499
- I'll still see Emma?
- Of course.

48:58.499 --> 49:00.062
But not for a little while.

49:03.499 --> 49:05.499
And it's better if she
doesn't do the movie.

49:06.499 --> 49:09.493
Hold on.

49:09.499 --> 49:11.493
It's just a few days, you know.

49:11.499 --> 49:14.499
- And her heart is set on it.
- Miles...

49:15.499 --> 49:18.493
It was her idea to drop out.

49:18.499 --> 49:21.499
But she needs you to tell her
that it's okay if she does.

49:23.499 --> 49:25.499
She doesn't wanna do my movie?

49:27.499 --> 49:29.493
She's afraid.

49:29.499 --> 49:32.493
Well, it's... It's new, you know.
It... Give her a couple of days...

49:32.499 --> 49:36.499
I do not want her to
get used to being afraid.

49:52.499 --> 49:55.493
You two should stay in the
house. I'll rent somewhere.

49:55.499 --> 49:57.499
- Find a place for us.
- Katie, just...

50:00.499 --> 50:02.499
Stay here. Okay?

50:08.499 --> 50:09.499
Thank you.

50:22.499 --> 50:24.493
- This wasn't my intention.
- Is that so?

50:24.499 --> 50:26.493
I didn't come to challenge you,

50:26.499 --> 50:29.499
I came out of an obligation
to Lord Munro.

50:31.499 --> 50:32.499
And for Margaret, yes?

50:42.499 --> 50:43.499
Stay down!

50:43.856 --> 50:45.849
And cut! Great job, guys.

50:46.185 --> 50:47.639
Yes! Yes!

50:47.742 --> 50:49.493
That was fun. That was great. Hey.

50:49.499 --> 50:51.493
So much better. Right?

50:51.499 --> 50:54.493
Thank you, first team.
Let's get second team in here.

50:54.499 --> 50:56.493
The last line as a threat. Brilliant.

50:56.499 --> 50:58.493
I don't know. I think, I think we
could use some more moves. Right?

50:58.499 --> 51:00.493
No, no. No, no. It's perfect. Love it.

51:00.499 --> 51:03.493
Entertaining. I... I can't
tell you how hard that scene is.

51:03.499 --> 51:05.493
- I'm so glad.
- It's amazing.

51:05.499 --> 51:08.493
You know, the, choreographer, he
did, Master and Commander.

51:08.499 --> 51:09.494
The flight guy.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.493
- Yeah.
- This so good. I want to meet that one.

51:12.499 --> 51:13.494
- Kisbye?
- Yes.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.493
Yeah. Sure. I'll introduce you.

51:15.499 --> 51:16.494
You know, excuse me

51:16.500 --> 51:19.493
just for one second, all
right? I'll be back in a bit.

51:21.499 --> 51:22.990
- Amara.
- Hi, April.

51:23.157 --> 51:27.132
There are period costumes but
these are not antiquated themes.

51:27.148 --> 51:30.354
April, this is Dan from
the Hollywood Reporter.

51:30.378 --> 51:31.493
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

51:31.499 --> 51:33.493
Yeah, I was just telling Dan
what makes this film so special.

51:33.499 --> 51:37.299
Yes, it is a treatise
on the power of love.

51:37.379 --> 51:38.493
But there is a complexity and a nuance

51:38.499 --> 51:41.499
that one can only find in
film making of this caliber.

52:46.499 --> 52:51.493
More, more, more struggles.
Struggle. Now, drop him.

52:55.547 --> 52:57.546
Would it have been anyone but you.

52:58.499 --> 53:01.493
Yes.

53:01.499 --> 53:05.493
Only, I'm not the man I used to be.

53:05.499 --> 53:09.499
I've seen enough blood this year
as I should see in a lifetime.

53:10.499 --> 53:13.499
So, I'm asking you, leave this place...

53:16.499 --> 53:18.499
But go in peace.

53:44.499 --> 53:46.493
Hi, Bliz.

53:46.499 --> 53:49.493
I'll give...
I'll give you whatever you need.

53:49.499 --> 53:51.493
Okay? Whatever you want.
Just let me know, I'll get...

53:51.499 --> 53:53.493
- Where's the coke?
- I got it. I got it.

53:53.499 --> 53:55.499
- Yeah, get it now.
- Okay.

54:02.499 --> 54:03.979
Take it all out, put it on the table.

54:04.499 --> 54:06.493
Here it is.

54:06.499 --> 54:08.493
Measure up an eight ball.

54:08.499 --> 54:10.493
- What?
- Did I fuckin' stutter?

54:10.499 --> 54:12.493
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry,

54:12.499 --> 54:15.493
I'm just gonna set this down
right here.

54:15.499 --> 54:17.493
We could...

54:28.499 --> 54:30.493
Okay. Great. That should be good.

54:30.499 --> 54:32.493
That should be good.
That should be good.

54:32.499 --> 54:34.493
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

54:34.499 --> 54:36.493
- You sure?
- Yeah.

55:07.499 --> 55:11.493
It can't be you. It simply can't.

55:11.499 --> 55:15.499
It is I, my love. I have found you.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.499
But at what cost?

55:21.482 --> 55:23.482
It doesn't matter now.

55:24.212 --> 55:25.212
I am here.

55:26.122 --> 55:29.034
And I will never
leave, not for anything.

55:30.499 --> 55:32.493
I am yours.

55:32.499 --> 55:36.167
And yours alone, forever.

55:37.499 --> 55:39.493
And cut.

55:39.499 --> 55:41.493
- Let's get tighter.
- Cut. Going tighter.

55:41.499 --> 55:43.493
I'm digging the new ending.

55:43.499 --> 55:44.494
Yeah. It's not so bleak.

55:44.500 --> 55:49.493
It's growing on me. Yeah?

55:49.499 --> 55:51.493
- Miles?
- Speaking.

55:51.499 --> 55:53.493
Hey, it's Wes from MGM.

55:53.499 --> 55:56.493
- Wes. How's it going?
- Good.

55:56.499 --> 55:58.493
Congratulations on Admiral's Mistress.

55:58.499 --> 56:00.493
That was a nifty little trick.

56:00.499 --> 56:01.247
Yes, it was.

56:01.254 --> 56:03.493
Look, I know you're
busy, I have a script

56:03.499 --> 56:06.493
that is very interesting, very original,

56:06.499 --> 56:08.493
and we're looking for a producer.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.379
I was wondering if you
wanted to give it a read.

56:10.499 --> 56:12.493
What made you think of me?

56:12.500 --> 56:14.978
Well, it's not the
easiest project to set up,

56:15.025 --> 56:18.493
and we need someone persuasive.

56:18.499 --> 56:21.146
Well, I can be very fucking persuasive.

56:21.499 --> 56:23.493
So I hear.

56:24.500 --> 56:28.499
Wes, I can't talk right
now. But by the sound of it,

56:29.499 --> 56:30.494
I'm your man.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.493
Great. I'm gonna have my
assistant set it up...

56:33.500 --> 56:36.499
Picture's up. Roll sound.

56:39.499 --> 56:40.499
Camera.

56:42.499 --> 56:43.494
Set.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.493
And, action.

56:45.499 --> 56:48.493
It can't be. It simply can't.
