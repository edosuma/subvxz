WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.463
JABLONSKI: Item three:

00:05.547 --> 00:08.758
okay, people, okay,
settle down, settle down,

00:08.842 --> 00:10.885
and I'll tell you
everything I know about this

00:10.969 --> 00:11.970
with the dim lights,

00:12.053 --> 00:15.390
and the hippie punks
running around upstairs.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.726
Yeah, they're making a TV program.

00:17.809 --> 00:18.893
Sarge, it's a rock video.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.937
-It's for TV, right?
-Yeah.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.856
-It's a program, right?
-Yeah, but it's called a video.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.650
Whatever they call it, they were supposed
to be out of here two hours ago!

00:25.734 --> 00:27.861
This was something
that the film board downtown

00:27.944 --> 00:29.070
put division up to,

00:29.154 --> 00:31.072
and now they're using up
all the electricity,

00:31.156 --> 00:32.699
they're setting off smoke.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.910
Look at that. We got to turn down
the smoke alarms.

00:35.994 --> 00:36.828
Yeah.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.205
That's all I know about it,
except for item four:

00:39.289 --> 00:42.417
they also got a permit
for Jefferson and 143 later on.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.003
Crowd control to be assigned at such time.

00:45.086 --> 00:48.882
Let's pray to the deity
they evacuate the squad room. Look.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.634
-Item five:
-(pop music plays)

00:52.677 --> 00:54.971
ongoings and undercovers.

00:55.055 --> 00:59.017
McCall and Craig, you're
at Jake and Jill's Barbecue.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.810
You guys know the score.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.731
Mick Belker starts Operation Con this A.M.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.067
Seems like the Department of Corrections

01:07.150 --> 01:09.235
has gotten suspicious of one of their own.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.696
So they're plugging in an unfamiliar mug

01:11.780 --> 01:14.824
to see what's going down
with a certain parole officer.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.868
Now, we planned the logistics,

01:16.951 --> 01:20.872
but Inspector Doherty
from the Corrections Department

01:20.955 --> 01:22.207
is gonna be coordinating.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.918
LaRue and Washington,
you're on call as backup.

01:25.001 --> 01:29.130
Item six: demonstration
this morning at the Hamlin Arms.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.341
Alvin Feigler and friends

01:31.424 --> 01:34.094
against the Jardino Construction Company.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.555
Now, Alvin is very O-L-D.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.517
And for some reason or other,
he doesn't like the idea

01:40.600 --> 01:44.521
of leaving the apartment
he's been living in for 56 years.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.565
Now this guy Jardino
has gotten a court order

01:47.649 --> 01:50.276
allowing him to begin
building a condo next door.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.403
Alvin figures
that his building's gonna be next,

01:52.487 --> 01:54.447
and he is not happy about it.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.493
Inspector Hunter
and his EATers are assigned.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.746
Lieutenant Goldblume
is trying to get a negotiation--

02:01.830 --> 02:03.748
-(sneezes)
-to continue.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.166
Gesundheit.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.794
Item last: also Lieutenant Goldblume.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.088
He transfers abode today.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.340
You gonna be residing
here on the hill, Lieutenant?

02:12.423 --> 02:14.926
Actually, I got in over the weekend.
I just wanted to tell everybody

02:15.009 --> 02:16.469
there's gonna be a get-together,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
an informal get-together this evening

02:18.763 --> 02:22.767
at, uh, 318 Richmond? 318 Richmond,

02:22.851 --> 02:25.186
starting around 7:00.
There's not much furniture yet,

02:25.270 --> 02:27.730
but there will be
a lot of beer and cold cuts.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.858
And you might want to leave
some police I.D.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.402
on your vehicle.
You know the neighborhood.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.405
Hey, Lieutenant,
one of the bedrooms furnished?

02:35.488 --> 02:37.782
(laughing)

02:37.866 --> 02:39.784
Okay, okay. Let's go! Let's move!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.661
They're getting away out there.

02:43.746 --> 02:47.292
You are a disgusting piece
of human garbage.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.711
Sue me, Renko. I got a cold.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.047
So then how much interest do I lose?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.843
No kidding about substantial penalty.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.805
Okay, when do I pick the check up?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.600
Okay, thanks very much.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.226
We got to stop at the credit union.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.061
Luce, have you asked anybody about this?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.897
-I mean, do you even know it's legal?
-What?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.356
Becoming Fabian's guardian.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.859
I'm gonna have his mother sign
an agreement before I give her the dough.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.612
I'm just asking.
Suppose she changes her mind,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.197
she decides she wants him back.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.907
-Does that agreement stand up?
-Yeah!

03:19.532 --> 03:21.618
-Miss Davenport.
-Officers.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.244
-Joe!
-Just ask her.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.663
-You're being a jerk--
-Go ahead and ask her.

03:25.747 --> 03:26.831
Ask me what?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.083
Lucy would like to ask you
a legal question.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.168
No, I wouldn't.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.837
There seems to be a difference of opinion.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.340
Why don't you just take
an ad out in the paper, Joe?

03:35.423 --> 03:38.176
Look, you didn't ask her
because you don't want to know the answer.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.178
I didn't ask her 'cause I don't want
everybody and their third cousin

03:40.261 --> 03:41.846
-to know about my personal business.
-Baloney!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.389
You're sticking your head in the sand now.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
It's my head! Leave me alone!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.685
<i>♪ Till the last breath I take ♪</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:49.604
<i>♪ I will always believe ♪</i>

03:49.687 --> 03:51.648
Uh, excuse me, Miss. Uh?

03:51.731 --> 03:54.984
You would not be interested
in having a real police officer

03:55.068 --> 03:56.819
in your little video show, now, would you?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.154
Well, actually, we are.

04:00.823 --> 04:01.908
Love patrol.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.286
Oh, I'm sorry. It's too posey.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.621
What does that mean?

04:06.704 --> 04:08.456
It means you're too stiff. Come on, Ringo.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.543
Stan? Stan, listen,
can we find a spot for the emperor?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.962
You know, for an hour or two?

04:14.045 --> 04:15.838
He goes in for his parvo shots at 11:00,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.924
and I got the Hamlin Arms till then.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.135
Hey, you still whomping
that guy with that ugly stick?

04:21.219 --> 04:24.681
Sure. Sure, put him behind the front desk.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.557
-I'll check him out.
-Thanks.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.684
(telephone ringing)

04:27.767 --> 04:30.270
He's got such a great puss.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.021
Ask him again.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.527
Uh, sir, we'd really be grateful
if you'd be in the next shot.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.154
-Will it get you out of here any faster?
-Yes!

04:40.613 --> 04:41.447
What do I do?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.200
Just look the way you're looking
when they walk by.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.080
<i>♪ I may never give this up ♪</i>

04:49.163 --> 04:52.292
<i>♪ Till the last breath I take, I will ♪</i>

04:52.375 --> 04:54.877
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:57.088
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:57.171 --> 05:01.009
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:01.092 --> 05:02.552
(theme music playing)

06:08.993 --> 06:11.996
(cheerful music playing)

06:46.155 --> 06:50.868
Anyway, I buried him,
and six hours later, I fell madly in love.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.579
You can't hardly ask for
a better funeral than that, partner.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.622
No, I guess not.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.749
I mean, I'm not complaining, you know.
I just...

06:56.833 --> 06:57.917
Renko, what's that?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.378
(laughing) The guy's sitting on the man.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.713
That looks like something
we ought to investigate

07:02.797 --> 07:04.465
after I get myself something to eat.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.385
-Eating my breakfast that I got.
-No, just turn around here.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.262
-I am surly, Robert.
-(tires screech)

07:09.345 --> 07:10.763
You're making me into a surly cop

07:10.847 --> 07:13.141
with an empty stomach. Look here.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.308
Is he dead or?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.310
HILL: Dudley Hicks.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.480
Dudley Hicks, what the hell
are you sitting on this guy for?

07:19.564 --> 07:20.606
Get up!

07:20.690 --> 07:21.732
(grunts)

07:21.816 --> 07:23.484
The dude asked me to sit on him.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.444
Yeah, I "axed" him.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.488
I only "axed" him after he first asked me
did I want him to?

07:27.572 --> 07:29.449
Lots of people likes me to sit on them.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.659
So he sits on me, then says he'll only
get off for a five-buck minimum.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.536
Minimum donation!

07:34.203 --> 07:36.581
Dudley Hicks, big boy,
you're under arrest.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.083
You're crazy, man. Arrest me for what?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.002
What for, Renko?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.297
Get in the car, man.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.466
MAN: Hey, man, you want us
to call anybody?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.428
-Lame, fellas!
-Lame is sitting on a man.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.848
All right, guys. Get on, get on.
Leave the streets. Come on.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.684
All right, Dudley, step on in there.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.685
Same old place.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.604
Number one: robbery with a deadly weapon.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.397
To wit,
this individual's excessive weight.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.441
Number two: gravitational assault.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.485
Number three:
there will be some more charges

08:05.568 --> 08:07.945
once my partner goes down
and looks at the penal code.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.615
(telephone rings)

08:11.699 --> 08:13.659
Uh, could you please listen?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.661
I don't have all morning
to get sandbagged.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.996
I'm Mel Jardino, all right?

08:17.079 --> 08:18.915
I'm here to see a Lieutenant Goldblume.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.292
Yeah. Officer, would you show Mr. Jardino

08:21.375 --> 08:23.419
-to interrogation A?
-Right.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.674
Our plan's to insulate Detective Belker
against the actual bust.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.177
I think that's wise.
I wouldn't underestimate the extent

08:31.260 --> 08:33.846
to which Parole Officer Edwards
has these cons intimidated.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.806
To be candid, Captain, I'm not sure

08:35.890 --> 08:38.267
if Edwards is connected
to corrections hierarchy.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.313
-But thanks for the use of personnel.
-Just be sure we get him back, Inspector.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.107
Look, Mr. Jardino,

08:46.108 --> 08:48.611
I have these people's signed assurances.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.740
No more demonstrations
if you'll commit as few as four apartments

08:52.823 --> 08:54.075
to moderate income.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.369
Now, that's down from 12. That's a token.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.080
Which I don't believe is your job

08:59.163 --> 09:01.123
to be shoving down my throat, all right?

09:01.207 --> 09:04.085
Title D don't require it. He knows it.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.294
And they know it.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.213
You're not even gonna get Title D funding

09:07.296 --> 09:08.631
unless you break ground today.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.385
Ah! That's where I trust
you people are gonna come in, hm?

09:12.468 --> 09:14.762
We'll get arrested and arrested again.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.722
We'll lie down under your bulldozers.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.808
I'm going back
to federal court, Mr. Jardino.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.309
One smirch against you,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.937
we get a temporary restraining order,
and you're finished.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.940
Now you can save yourself
all that right now.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.984
(chuckles)

09:28.067 --> 09:30.736
Don't kid a kidder, okay, Mr. Purvis?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.530
You've had weeks to find your smirch.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.781
You came up with zip,

09:33.864 --> 09:35.992
like you're coming up
with zip again today.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.202
Now...

09:39.036 --> 09:40.079
(sighs)

09:40.162 --> 09:41.539
I'm going back to my site.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.084
And I want these people
of his cleared off it.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.377
(clears throat)

09:46.460 --> 09:47.461
Is that it?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.463
We went all the way
with this, Mr. Feigler.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.508
Um, I could make a few more motions,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.635
but, um, I'm sorry.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.013
Thank you very much.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.056
Could I advise you, Mr. Feigler?

09:59.640 --> 10:01.434
Don't break the law.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.145
We'd only have to arrest you,
and they'll still get started.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.605
I know what I have to do.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.899
Dorothy, let's go home now.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.360
(door opens)

10:12.570 --> 10:14.572
Actually, they've got
a pretty good robbery here.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.867
What's that supposed to mean?
I sat on the dude.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.493
You coerced him to give you money.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.162
He asked me to sit on him.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.122
You coerced him to ask you.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.875
Come on, lady.
I've been sitting on dudes for months now.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.294
You know what our best shot is, Dudley?

10:28.377 --> 10:30.254
The time-honored stupidity defense.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.048
What's that?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.008
It's when you try to persuade the judge

10:34.091 --> 10:37.094
that what you did is so stupid
it couldn't have meant any harm.

10:37.845 --> 10:41.265
It's when you try to get him to want
to tell his date about you tonight.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.642
Will it get me off?

10:43.934 --> 10:48.105
I'd say maybe probation,
but you're already on probation.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.525
What if I lose some weight then?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.527
What's that got to do with it?

10:53.611 --> 10:58.532
You know, uh,
sort of like disarming myself.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.492
Excellent, Dudley.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.371
We had a pretty good
stupidity defense going in.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.539
But I think you just perfected it.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.916
(romantic music playing)

11:06.999 --> 11:07.958
Like this?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.835
Perfect. Don't blink an eye.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.462
(indistinct chatter)

11:15.007 --> 11:15.841
No good.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.220
Um, what's our problem?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.055
I'm not gonna have her
pointing a gun at me.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.223
It's not real.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.975
I know that. No gun.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.312
Liza, look menacing. (exhales)

11:36.404 --> 11:38.698
Mitchell Bragg, Mr. Edwards.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.660
I just got here
from Pittsburgh Correctional upstate.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.163
Sit down.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.753
Let's see,

11:52.837 --> 11:54.630
B&amp;E, B&amp;E,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.925
unlawful use of vehicle. Not too bad.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.512
Uh-oh, what's this? Narcotics possession.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.139
It was a long time ago. I was--

12:03.222 --> 12:04.223
Shut up, okay?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.101
Let's see.

12:07.184 --> 12:10.187
Aha, then you moved up, grand theft auto.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.189
Popped three times, two convictions.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.107
Mr. Edwards--

12:13.190 --> 12:15.818
I said shut up because it's listen time.

12:17.903 --> 12:18.904
Good.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.950
Because frankly, you're a slug.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.580
And I'd be doing this city a big favor
handing you a ticket back to the cage.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.416
I don't want to do
no more time, Mr. Edwards.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.834
Let's play a little game, huh?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.712
I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.338
What's your pleasure, Mitch?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.840
What do you want to hear first?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.343
Well, I think I'd like
to hear the good news first.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.139
No, I think I got to give you
the bad news first, Mitch.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.348
That's fine.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.684
The bad news is, you got to be a good boy.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.687
You got to be on your good-boy behavior.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.688
I know that.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.607
No narcotics, Mitch.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.567
What's it say here?

12:58.068 --> 13:01.697
"Not allowed to use or be
in possession of narcotics

13:01.781 --> 13:04.074
or where narcotics are present."

13:04.158 --> 13:06.327
It's no problem for me
anymore, Mr. Edwards.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.662
I hope not.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.960
Because if I find you
with narcotics, Mitch, you go away.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.132
You go back
to your boyfriends in the hole.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.050
I know that.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.928
So what I'm saying is,
keep me happy, all right, Mitch?

13:24.845 --> 13:28.057
When I'm happy, I don't start remembering
what a wrong guy you basically are.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.477
All those wrong things
I can't catch you doing.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.939
When I'm happy, I don't overcompensate
by raiding Mitch's glove box

13:35.022 --> 13:36.482
and finding a little toot in there.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.235
That's not me.
I don't do that stuff no more.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.529
Isn't what I'm saying, Mitch.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.076
How about the good news?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.744
-The good news?
-Yeah.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.542
The good news, Mitch?

13:55.709 --> 13:57.586
I can get you a job.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.383
(chanting) Hey, hey, big man "J,"

14:02.466 --> 14:04.677
How many homes you gonna steal today?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.554
Dozers want clearance, Henry.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.015
Their boss is up in Feigler's apartment.
They can hold their water five minutes.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.394
-Hey, he said don't wait for him.
-Hey, I said wait for him!

14:13.477 --> 14:16.480
(indistinct chatter)

14:16.564 --> 14:17.731
People!

14:17.815 --> 14:21.652
People, barring any last-minute
breakthrough, which I doubt,

14:21.735 --> 14:23.654
we'll be escorting you
to the vans over here.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.490
I thought you were our neighbor!
I thought you were gonna help us!

14:26.574 --> 14:27.616
I tried.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.411
Now, please don't resist the police
who are gonna be moving you.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.997
-(glass shatters)
-(suspenseful music playing)

14:33.080 --> 14:35.165
-(glass shatters)
-(people shouting)

14:35.249 --> 14:36.750
-MAN: No!
-(thud)

14:43.549 --> 14:45.676
(melancholic music playing)

14:47.887 --> 14:52.141
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:54.184 --> 14:57.354
Pure, 100-proof bing-bong, Lieutenant.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.773
Mel Jardino pays his taxes.
Do you understand?

14:59.857 --> 15:03.819
Mel Jardino sponsors
a damn little league team.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.362
Best uniforms in the city!

15:05.446 --> 15:06.906
Mel Jardino doesn't go around

15:06.989 --> 15:09.116
pushing old geezers out of windows!

15:09.199 --> 15:12.077
-Henry, I got a witness here for you.
-What does that cockroach say?

15:13.454 --> 15:16.373
He says he was leaving the room.
He was at the door when Feigler jumped.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.001
Liar! Murderer! I was at the door.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.962
-He pushed Alvin out.
-Ah, for crying out, sick!

15:22.046 --> 15:22.922
You see that?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.840
No, I didn't see it, but I heard it.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.176
"I'm gonna kill you."
That's what he shouted.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
(sighs)

15:30.095 --> 15:32.723
Norm? You want to take this guy in?

15:32.806 --> 15:35.559
Come on, Lieutenant! Play fair.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.103
-This is total hysterical lies.
-Suspicion of murder.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This woman hates me.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.692
She was in cahoots!
And she slept with the guy!

15:43.776 --> 15:45.945
Come on, sport,
I'll read you all your rights.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.280
-Come on.
-Come on!

15:48.364 --> 15:49.615
Call Weidner, will ya?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.742
(indistinct chatter)

15:57.247 --> 15:58.791
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:58.874 --> 16:00.793
Hey, Luce,
will you cut the silent treatment?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.252
You just mind your own business.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.713
You want me to mind my own business?

16:04.797 --> 16:05.965
Yes!

16:06.048 --> 16:06.924
You got it.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.050
Good.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.885
Good. Fine.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.053
Good.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.388
Fine, you got it.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.347
All right.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.557
(indistinct chatter)

16:15.641 --> 16:17.267
You want your phone call, Jardino?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.896
Yeah, and you know who I'm calling?
Damn mayor's who I'm calling.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.231
Suit yourself.

16:23.107 --> 16:27.778
Hey, Lieutenant, what's the difference
between Al Feigler and a pizza?

16:27.861 --> 16:28.696
What's that?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.698
Pizza don't have
little pieces of glass in it.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.200
(laughs)

16:33.283 --> 16:35.953
See, if I pushed him out,
would I make a joke?

16:36.036 --> 16:38.288
(telephone ringing)

16:39.164 --> 16:40.416
Goldblume in charge of this?

16:40.499 --> 16:41.917
Plus, we sent Dietz and Ferris.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.919
We got LaRue and Washington on the phones.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.088
-Where's our witness?
-They're bringing her in.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.340
-Interrogation room A for Jardino.
-Mm.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.511
-Come on, let's go.
-RENKO: Taking the A train, Dudley.

16:52.594 --> 16:55.431
Hill, Renko,
you guys clear court at what time?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.683
Get him on the next bus,
we'll be there by lunch.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.602
Good. You got crowd control
on this surveillance group.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.896
Uh, tick-tock, miss.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.733
Yeah, we're going. Excuse me, sir.
My director asked me...

17:05.816 --> 17:07.609
You know, you have a terrific look.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.486
-How'd you like to be in a video?
-Him?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.905
Yeah Lame, I got a look.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.449
Ma'am, this man is busted.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.868
This man is a felon who sits on people.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.620
Oh, well, if you get out of jail,
this is where we'll be.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.582
-And, hey, it pays 90 bucks.
-Yo.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.584
-RENKO: Take a walk!
-(laughing)

17:26.920 --> 17:29.173
Hey, uh, whose animal is that?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.092
If it's mine,
you come over to my place later?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.596
No, but I could authorize 100 bucks
to borrow him for an hour.

17:35.679 --> 17:36.764
Let's negotiate.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.019
So I said to him I would help him
find a place over on Sycamore.

17:42.102 --> 17:42.936
For him alone?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.314
What am I supposed to support,
his whole army?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.107
-And he said no.
-Uh-huh.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.026
So then I said to hell
with him, I'm leaving.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.944
And he said something dumb like,
"The hell with me,"

17:51.028 --> 17:53.197
and that he's gonna show me
who I'm dealing with,

17:53.280 --> 17:55.908
and he's not gonna live like a cockroach,
and so on and so on.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.869
And then all of a sudden, bango,
he checks out right then and there.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.788
Ran himself through a closed window?

18:00.871 --> 18:04.583
First, he broke it with a lamp.
Hey, the man was no rocket scientist.

18:04.666 --> 18:09.129
Look, Captain, I've got $4.2 mil.
riding on breaking ground today,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.215
and I can't get started
if I'm stuck in here.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.425
Their tube steak lawyer's gonna jam me up.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.762
Your financial tribulations
are no concern of mine, Mr. Jardino.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.514
Well, what about the damn truth, huh?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.433
If I was gonna air-mail somebody,
would I do it right into 30 cops?

18:21.975 --> 18:24.311
Captain, Dorothy Miskin's
waiting in your office.

18:24.394 --> 18:25.312
Excuse me.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.815
-That's a real good one.
-(door closes)

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
Just remember,

18:29.399 --> 18:31.527
she was the old coot's mistress.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.154
Probably jumped because he couldn't stand
the sight of her.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.198
You want to try the mayor again, sport?

18:38.617 --> 18:39.451
-Stan.
-What?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.369
My Shar Pei?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.454
-Yeah, right where you left him.
-But he isn't. He isn't there.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.873
He's right there.
He's right in the carrier.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.792
Great day.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.045
I finally get rid of the hippies.
Now I got missing canines.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.422
You were close friends with Alvin Feigler.

18:52.506 --> 18:53.340
Yes.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.261
That's why you were listening at his door.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.263
It was a terrible fight.
I couldn't help it.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.889
I started hearing terrible shouts.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.600
Jardino shouting, shouting.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.185
Alvin saying he was gonna kill him.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.188
-Do you live on the same floor as Alvin?
-No, one flight up.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.314
But you heard the fight.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.316
I was coming down the stairs.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.403
You weren't at the demonstration,
though you were part of Alvin's movement.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.240
I went back upstairs
to get a heavier coat.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.661
I'm sorry to ask you all these questions
at a time like this, Mrs. Miskin.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.205
No! I want this Jardino caught.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.542
Otherwise, Alvin died, for what?

19:28.625 --> 19:29.585
(crying)

19:31.253 --> 19:33.547
Do you know, Mrs. Miskin,

19:33.630 --> 19:37.301
did Alvin invite Jardino up,
or did Jardino come on his own?

19:37.384 --> 19:40.762
What difference?
Please, I heard what I heard.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.893
How long had you known Alvin?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.605
Four years,
since I moved into the building.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.567
A noble human being,

19:54.985 --> 19:56.987
a principled man.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.533
And now this murdering butcher,
Melvin Jardino...

20:02.034 --> 20:02.993
(crying)

20:04.578 --> 20:07.706
Did Alvin ever say anything
to you, even casually,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.083
about suicide?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.044
-(knocking on door)
-Alvin?

20:12.127 --> 20:14.421
Excuse me, Captain.
Can I see you for a minute?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.550
I'm sorry. Excuse me, please.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.184
What's the story?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.895
Says he saw Jardino
in the hall when Feigler jumped.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.606
Says Feigler told people
he'd kill himself if he had to

20:32.689 --> 20:34.149
in order to stop Jardino.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.026
Plus, Feigler had an inoperable cancer.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.403
Will you take care of Mrs. Miskin?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.530
-Also, we better raise Henry.
-Right.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.492
An all points on the animal,

20:43.575 --> 20:48.330
and he responds to the name Emperor,
Lao Tzu, Fatso, Flatso--

20:48.413 --> 20:49.456
JABLONSKY: Flatso, Lieutenant?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.709
You know, I wouldn't be
sarcastic about a nickname

20:52.793 --> 20:54.127
-right now, Sergeant.
-Oh? Why?

20:54.211 --> 20:55.963
If you'd given more than just lip service

20:56.046 --> 20:57.422
to looking after him,
we wouldn't have this problem.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.341
I didn't look after him?

20:59.424 --> 21:03.470
What kind of a police officer
brings his dog to work, anyway?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.181
Well, if you insist on extracting
all the personal details,

21:06.265 --> 21:08.100
my vet happens to be right down the block.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.227
I wouldn't bring Blackie to the office.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.896
(chuckles) Well, I understand that.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.606
What's that supposed to mean?

21:15.232 --> 21:16.858
Are you insulting Blackie's lineage?

21:16.942 --> 21:20.362
Oh, calm down, Stan.
You incompetently lost my dog.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.699
-I lost your dog?
-Yes, you lost my dog.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.535
I got TV programs, I got hippie punks,

21:26.618 --> 21:28.036
I'm trying to keep the power on,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.539
get them the hell out of here,
perform all of my own duties,

21:30.622 --> 21:32.082
act in their damn movie,

21:32.165 --> 21:35.585
and now I'm expected
to babysit your mutt non-stop?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.880
I ought to report you
to the Humane Society.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.592
It's not a mutt.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.975
This here, bays one and two,
that's where we do the inspection.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.227
That over there is the line,

21:52.311 --> 21:55.063
the importance of which
I will explain to you.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.233
No customer crosses that line
while I'm doing the inspection.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.693
Yeah, because of the insurance.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.821
Yeah, the insurance.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.907
You one of, uh, Edwards', Mitch?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.451
Yeah. You too?

22:09.119 --> 22:11.496
Just do what the man say, understand?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.749
Then there's no problems.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.542
Everybody does great.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.879
Automotive background, Mitch?

22:18.962 --> 22:19.963
What do you mean?

22:20.047 --> 22:24.217
Hey, lighten up, dude. Me? I'm automotive.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.304
I got two GLA's, one unauthorized use

22:27.387 --> 22:29.181
out of about 250.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.350
(laughs)

22:31.433 --> 22:33.602
Just equips you for the job, am I right?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.437
This is pretty righteous. Edwards,

22:35.520 --> 22:37.773
he sticks us both in a garage.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.483
Well, like I'm saying, Mitch,

22:39.566 --> 22:42.152
Mr. Edwards is a practical man.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.822
Just do the two, three things he say.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.948
(sighs)

22:47.032 --> 22:49.159
-He tell you to listen to me?
-Yeah.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.078
Now you listen to me, all right?

22:51.995 --> 22:54.206
This line over here is yours.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.000
Nobody crosses this line.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.335
You drive the cars up.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.420
I'll show you the reason for that later,

23:00.504 --> 23:01.922
if you're interested.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.382
I'm interested.

23:03.924 --> 23:04.925
All right.

23:06.343 --> 23:11.098
Well, go on now.
Hey, look, anybody tries to bribe, uh-uh.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.975
You tell them this is an honest place.
You got it?

23:14.059 --> 23:16.228
I got it. It's an honest place.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.398
Henry, have you seen the emperor?

23:19.481 --> 23:20.565
Napoleon?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.528
Lieutenant.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.322
I didn't know it was yours, sir.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.243
That girl with the black tights
and the blond hair in the band took him.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.328
I thought it was part of their equipment.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.163
Judas H.!

23:36.790 --> 23:41.002
Oh, sorry. Thank you, Sergeant.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.170
You're welcome.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.713
(telephone ringing)

23:43.797 --> 23:44.923
Get back to work!

23:47.509 --> 23:48.510
Frank?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.720
How are we doing forensically
on the Feigler case?

23:50.804 --> 23:52.973
We haven't turned up
any viable prints yet.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.642
And I suppose you've heard
about the conflicting witnesses.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.893
Talked to both of them.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.520
One makes perfect sense,
the other one doesn't.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.563
Which?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.523
The neutral one makes sense.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.316
The one who said Feigler
had three months to live

24:03.400 --> 24:05.152
and made a suicide plan
with Dorothy's knowledge.

24:05.235 --> 24:08.989
Three months or not, it takes a lot
to make a man jump out a window.

24:09.072 --> 24:12.367
And even more to push a man into
the middle of an emergency action team.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.579
Jardino knew if he didn't get started
today, he'd lose enormous bucks.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.496
The project folds.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.083
Henry, the only witness we have
against Jardino is Dorothy Miskin.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.585
Putting aside her interest,

24:21.668 --> 24:23.003
when I talked to her,

24:23.086 --> 24:24.963
she contradicted the logic
of the situation

24:25.046 --> 24:27.090
at least three times, then broke down.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.760
Talked to Feigler's
psychiatric social worker,

24:30.844 --> 24:32.095
which I didn't know he had one,

24:32.179 --> 24:34.764
but he considers a suicide attempt

24:34.848 --> 24:36.933
"within pattern parameters."

24:40.687 --> 24:42.147
Let's let Jardino go.

24:42.939 --> 24:46.151
Why? Afraid he'll miss
a date with the bulldozer?

24:46.234 --> 24:48.320
We have no credible evidence
against him, Henry.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.821
Do we? You're in charge.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.076
The old folks' pro Bono lawyer
is obtaining restraining order

24:55.160 --> 24:57.204
right now based on Jardino's arrest.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.248
If we keep him one day,
maybe Feigler doesn't die in vain.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.083
Release him.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.837
-This investigation's not closed.
-Of course it's not.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.423
-For now, release him.
-Jardino is wrong, Frank.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.969
There are grand juries
all over the state sniffing his trousers.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.722
Today, next month, next year,
he's going down. And when he does,

25:15.805 --> 25:18.642
there's gonna be an empty hole
where my neighbors are living now.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.478
(door opens)

25:24.648 --> 25:26.066
(siren wailing)

25:26.149 --> 25:29.319
S.I.D. is pulling threads from the window,
re-shooting some pictures.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.196
Make sure everything's labeled, okay?

25:32.155 --> 25:37.994
(indistinct chatter)

25:41.748 --> 25:45.168
Well, what are we waiting for,
Lieutenant, World War III?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.921
Mr. Jardino, it may surprise you to learn

25:48.004 --> 25:51.633
that we check out a suicide
just the same as a homicide.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.427
And how long is
"checking it out just the same"

25:54.511 --> 25:55.679
gonna take, would you say?

25:55.762 --> 26:01.434
Oh, average homicide-site work,
13, 14 hours.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.311
That's lame, my friend.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.273
That's lame and you know it,
and you're not gonna get away with it.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.608
My dozers roll by 4:00!

26:08.692 --> 26:10.819
I wouldn't make book on it, Mr. Jardino.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.114
Let's make sure we got all the fragments
of that broken lamp,

26:14.197 --> 26:15.949
only way we got a shot at a print.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.202
Lay all you want, pal.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.203
What's that mean?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.747
You're saying not to make book.
I'm saying lay all you want.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.417
Believe me, those dozers are gonna roll!

26:28.086 --> 26:28.962
Hello.

26:29.045 --> 26:29.963
Thank you.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.425
Um, look, I'll be honest with you.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.386
The backup lights occasionally don't hit.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.096
Occasionally or never?

26:39.222 --> 26:42.142
So, I'll give you $25.
If you make the adjustment, great.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.644
Otherwise, whatever you want.

26:45.645 --> 26:48.064
Sorry, ma'am, this is an honest place.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.401
Excuse me.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.741
(engine turns over)

27:04.956 --> 27:05.874
Mitch!

27:07.292 --> 27:09.961
WOMAN (OVER P.A.):
<i>Will the owner of a red sedan...</i>

27:10.045 --> 27:11.296
Come here a minute.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.632
WOMAN (OVER P.A.):
<i>Parked int he loading dock.</i>

27:13.715 --> 27:14.716
Hop in.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.765
Close the door, Mitch.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.267
(door closes)

27:27.562 --> 27:28.480
(grunts)

27:28.563 --> 27:30.273
(chuckles)

27:30.357 --> 27:31.900
What am I doing now, Mitch?

27:32.901 --> 27:36.655
You're checking out the wires
from under the dash.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.697
Right.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.240
Right.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.036
So, bud...

27:44.829 --> 27:46.915
what do you think about
the pay around here?

27:47.791 --> 27:51.795
It stinks. $3.50 an hour is the pits.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.171
Can't live on that. Am I right?

27:53.254 --> 27:54.255
Not too good.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.424
You'd be dead if you had a family.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.051
You'd be on welfare.

27:58.134 --> 28:02.555
Would you believe it, Mitch, if I told you
in here could be a good living?

28:02.639 --> 28:05.934
I don't want to go back, Stubby.
I owe 4 1/2.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.228
Edwards looks pretty tough.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.357
Edwards <i>is </i>tough, man, but he's a realist.

28:13.525 --> 28:18.530
I mean, would he put guys like you and me
in a car place if he wasn't a realist?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.907
-What are you saying?
-(chuckles)

28:20.990 --> 28:24.244
I'm saying,
Edwards doesn't mind some things,

28:24.327 --> 28:26.079
as long as he's not left out of it.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.665
But things? Like what kind of things?

28:40.552 --> 28:43.263
What am I doing now, Mitch?

28:43.346 --> 28:46.015
Now you're making a print for a dupe key.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.395
Here's the registration.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.694
Write down the address.
And later today, we'll go make a pickup.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.488
(chuckles) We can't do that.
The guy will figure it out.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.532
(laughing) Uh-uh!

29:03.241 --> 29:06.995
Today, we pick up the Caddy
that was inspected three months ago.

29:07.620 --> 29:11.583
This one we'll pick up
three months from now.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.880
Let's understand each other,
Captain, all right?

29:16.963 --> 29:19.007
I don't turn earth at that site by 5:00,

29:19.090 --> 29:20.008
that project's dead.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.885
I lose my federal underwrite.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.511
That's not my problem, Mr. Jardino.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.346
But it's my problem!

29:25.430 --> 29:27.182
And that <i>lieutenant</i> of yours,

29:27.265 --> 29:29.642
he's down there turning
that investigation into a joke.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.563
People are stopping for traffic lights,
he's asking them for statements, come on.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.982
Captain, that case is open and shut.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.818
That old man killed himself,
and everybody knows it.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.738
Lieutenant Goldblume told me
he's concluding his investigation.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.448
He ain't, and he ain't gonna!

29:45.867 --> 29:46.701
Now,

29:48.161 --> 29:50.163
what's it gonna take
to get him off the case?

29:50.246 --> 29:51.080
What do you mean?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.666
I mean we're both adults, hm?

29:55.502 --> 29:59.339
I've got an envelope in here
with $5,000 inside.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.507
And I can have it?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.259
Yeah.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.471
Call it a campaign contribution...

30:06.554 --> 30:10.058
(sighs) or whatever you want.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.352
All I have to do is help you...

30:13.686 --> 30:14.521
Yeah.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.481
Wrong answer.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.778
-(indistinct chatter)
-(telephone ringing)

30:22.529 --> 30:23.488
Miss Davenport?

30:23.571 --> 30:24.864
Sergeant.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.157
I wanted to say I'm sorry

30:26.241 --> 30:28.326
about that whole stooge routine
this morning.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.619
No harm done.

30:29.702 --> 30:30.995
And actually,
if you have a couple minutes,

30:31.079 --> 30:32.664
there's something
I'd like to ask you about.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.915
I've got a couple minutes.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.209
Believe it or not,

30:36.292 --> 30:38.294
you know how people are always saying,

30:38.378 --> 30:40.129
"This happened to a friend of mine"?

30:40.213 --> 30:41.923
Well, this actually did.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.384
What's your friend's problem?

30:48.304 --> 30:49.722
Can we start over?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.182
-Sure.
-Okay.

30:55.812 --> 30:59.065
Uh, you remember Fabian, the kid
that stayed with me for a while last year?

30:59.148 --> 31:00.525
I've represented his mother.

31:00.608 --> 31:03.444
Okay, she wants me to be his guardian.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.197
I mean, she wants to sign over
his guardianship papers.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.115
And?

31:08.116 --> 31:11.411
And I just wanted to know
if she signs the agreement,

31:11.494 --> 31:15.164
then later on, could she change her mind?
Could she go back on the agreement?

31:15.248 --> 31:19.168
I doubt a guardianship arrangement
could survive beyond her consent.

31:19.252 --> 31:22.046
What if she did more than just make
an arrangement? I mean,

31:22.130 --> 31:23.965
what if she did, more?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.011
If you don't trust me
with the facts, Lucy,

31:28.094 --> 31:30.138
I can't give you an informed opinion.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.185
She said that if I gave her $2,000,

31:36.269 --> 31:38.146
she would stay out of Fabian's life,

31:38.229 --> 31:40.481
and I could raise him
in a good environment.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.525
Now what I want to know is,
if she gets the money,

31:42.609 --> 31:44.444
then... can she go back on it?

31:44.527 --> 31:46.988
Can she still change her mind?
Could she try to get him back?

31:48.364 --> 31:51.701
If it came to a case,
there would be the law on both sides.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.122
You could claim
enforceable contract to adopt.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.792
She could plead duress,
impairment of judgment.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.629
So...

32:03.588 --> 32:07.467
you don't think that giving her the money
would settle it once and for all?

32:09.510 --> 32:10.345
(sighs)

32:10.428 --> 32:13.306
Other than keeping Vivian Dewitt
high for a little while,

32:14.641 --> 32:15.808
I'm afraid I don't.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.519
Thanks.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.729
Yeah.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.610
You know, I can't believe this.
This is disgusting.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.529
Actual cops standing around,
and they hire frauds.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.616
They're actors, Renko. Actors.
They're just doing their job.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.369
You mean to tell me that that fruit loop
dancing around up there

32:34.452 --> 32:37.538
in that spangled outfit
looks more like a cop than I do?

32:37.622 --> 32:38.623
Just prettier.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.000
Counsel me in the ways
of peace, gentlemen.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.294
I may be about to do murder.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.754
What's the matter, Lieutenant?

32:44.837 --> 32:50.009
<i>♪ The last breath I take,</i>
<i>I will always believe ♪</i>

32:50.093 --> 32:51.511
Where's my dog?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.972
Cut it! Cut it.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.682
-(indistinct chatter)
-What?

32:55.765 --> 32:57.225
Where is my dog?

32:57.308 --> 33:00.436
I don't have a small idea
what you're talking about.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.981
I am talking about a Shar Pei pup.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.399
I am given to understand,

33:04.482 --> 33:07.568
was absconded with
by a member of your company.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.736
Tamara!

33:08.820 --> 33:09.988
Yeah, yeah?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.950
Oh! Oh, no! What?

33:14.867 --> 33:17.996
Why is my dog painted like a zebra?

33:18.079 --> 33:20.748
Just broke out of jail.
He's still in his prison outfit.

33:20.832 --> 33:21.916
HILL: Easy, Lieutenant.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.002
Tamara, didn't we get
a release on this dog?

33:24.085 --> 33:27.672
Yeah, it's right here, uh, "L.D. LaRue."

33:27.755 --> 33:30.842
-Or "J." Yeah, it's a "J."
-Whatever.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.554
"100 bucks for the day. Dog
to be returned to Hill Street Station."

33:34.637 --> 33:36.931
Mr. LaRue has no connection
to that animal.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.516
Sir, it's wash-off paint.

33:38.599 --> 33:42.186
Tamara, if we paid the wrong person,
let's pay the right one.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.855
You don't have the currency, sir.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.148
(indistinct chatter)

33:45.231 --> 33:47.358
Use the original dog. Paint the Shih Tzu.

33:47.442 --> 33:52.613
Yo! I'm a free man now.
Who's gonna make me a star?

33:53.906 --> 33:56.617
Process this man's paperwork
and get him in a cop's outfit.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.453
Cop?

33:58.536 --> 34:01.289
It's a daylight shot, folks.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.624
All right, everybody.
First positions, please.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.294
Dudley Hicks a cop?

34:06.919 --> 34:10.923
I do not understand show business one bit.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.220
(engine turns over)

34:18.181 --> 34:20.016
(engine revs)

34:22.060 --> 34:24.812
There, right on the street, beauty.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.272
How far down you want me?

34:26.355 --> 34:27.982
Just around the corner.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.903
You're looking out for me now.

34:31.986 --> 34:35.281
Any trouble, just holler,
"we're repo" and pick me up.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.365
You got it.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.675
Freeze! You're busted. Hands on the dash.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.314
(sighs)

35:08.397 --> 35:10.525
-Little guy was a cop?
-Little guy?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.151
You got other things
to worry about, Stubby.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.444
Give us Edwards.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.323
-Give me a way.
-Sign a statement and testify.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.534
-That's no way.
-Then you're going back inside.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.786
We're gonna bust the guy.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.038
It don't matter you bust him.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.832
Mr. Edwards is bad.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.835
He still know what jobs he had fellas do.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.419
He'll tell a con, "Do for Stubby,

35:30.503 --> 35:33.714
or else I'll give up
what you did for me at so-and-so."

35:33.798 --> 35:36.175
And they'll cut me,
and you'll find me dead in an alley.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.010
He doesn't want to help himself, J.D.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.055
I want to help,
but the man can't know I gave him up.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.933
What about we mike the room,
you don't know about it.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.103
-You just get him talking.
-How am I not gonna know about it?

35:47.186 --> 35:48.062
I know about it.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.815
Don't be dense, Stubby.
It ain't in your own interest right now.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.025
(sighs)

35:54.318 --> 35:55.486
Yeah, sure.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.073
-We'll check it out with our captain.
-Yeah, don't go anywhere, Stub.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.452
-(indistinct chatter)
-(telephone ringing)

36:05.037 --> 36:08.040
Hey, Sarge, tell that captain of yours
and his jerk lieutenant

36:08.124 --> 36:10.084
they better hire somebody
to start their cars.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.836
Mel. Calm down, Mel!

36:11.919 --> 36:13.421
Why? I'm gonna get in trouble?

36:13.504 --> 36:16.257
-Maybe I'll lose the construction project.
-Well, just relax.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.301
(typing)

36:19.552 --> 36:20.469
Joe?

36:22.305 --> 36:24.223
Oh, it's miss vows of silence, huh?

36:24.765 --> 36:26.058
Can you come over tonight?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.852
-For what?
-I need your help.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.229
Yeah.

36:36.944 --> 36:40.198
Oh, is this Mr. LaRue,
the dog entrepreneur?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.699
Run that to the captain.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.244
Lieutenant, I heard what happened.

36:45.328 --> 36:49.081
No way did I think they were taking
this pooch out of precinct confines.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.959
Well, Detective, I am trying to understand

36:52.043 --> 36:53.878
why it was in your province

36:53.961 --> 36:55.838
to have thoughts
of any sort in this matter.

36:55.922 --> 36:59.842
Lieutenant, the girl comes up to me,
this dork director's assistant says,

36:59.926 --> 37:01.344
can they rent the mutt?

37:01.427 --> 37:03.888
Says it's worth a yard to them
to use him in their film.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.723
I'm thinking,
"Hey, dog's gonna be here anyway.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.976
Why not put a couple of bucks
in Lieutenant Hunter's pocket?"

37:09.060 --> 37:10.978
Okay, so I'm gone. I come back.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.813
I find out they had the dog outside.

37:12.897 --> 37:13.940
I was sick.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.443
Ah, I presume it was also on your return
that you intended to inform me

37:17.526 --> 37:18.945
-about this transaction?
-Yeah.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.571
And provide me with the stipend?

37:21.197 --> 37:23.699
I, uh, got the dough for you right here.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.286
Hey, let me just endorse this over to you.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.955
Oh.

37:29.038 --> 37:33.834
Uh, Lieutenant, uh,
no chance of a 10% finder's fee, huh?

37:35.336 --> 37:37.088
It's as good as we're gonna get, Captain.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.173
-He won't testify?
-He's terrified of Edwards.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.758
Let's get a warrant
for the interrogation room.

37:40.841 --> 37:41.676
Right.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.470
Frank, what happened?

37:44.553 --> 37:46.973
Jardino's people just pulled
off the construction site.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.684
We just charged Mel Jardino
with felony bribery.

37:51.811 --> 37:54.105
That will do it. That will shut him down.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.232
-Who'd he try to bribe?
-Me.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.402
(laughs)

38:00.027 --> 38:01.487
It will help a lot of people, Frank.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.073
A lot of old folks won't have
to leave their apartments.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.075
For the record, Henry...

38:09.662 --> 38:11.706
when Jardino tried to bribe me,

38:12.456 --> 38:14.875
I was about to replace you
on that investigation.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.255
-What do you mean? What for?
-For exactly what Jardino accused you of.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.382
For dragging your feet.
For trying to get him shut down.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.593
Frank, you need more proof this guy's
wrong than what he just tried to pull?

38:24.677 --> 38:26.429
You were conducting
an investigation, Henry.

38:26.512 --> 38:29.098
You weren't there to pass policy
on who gets federal loans.

38:29.181 --> 38:32.101
Oh, that's great. There's discretion
on the street and in the captain's office.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.352
No place in between, right?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.771
There must have been
five times in the past week, Henry,

38:35.855 --> 38:39.317
when I asked for you and was told
you were at a tenants' meeting.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.279
Or you were down at city hall,
helping to file a C-6 occupancy extension.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.823
Which is their right to request
and mine to assist with.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.992
It's your right, but it's not your job!

38:48.075 --> 38:50.328
I thought
I was Community Relations Officer.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.747
I thought moving up here,
getting involved in things,

38:52.830 --> 38:56.042
thought that was a good thing
for an occasional cop or two to do.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.092
(door slams)

39:07.636 --> 39:11.474
-Mr. Edwards?
-What happened here, Stubby? What you do?

39:12.141 --> 39:15.227
-They popped me for the Cadillac.
-What do you mean the Cadillac?

39:15.311 --> 39:16.145
<i>You stole a car?</i>

39:16.979 --> 39:19.857
-That piece you sent me to boost.
-Don't you ever say I sent you!

39:19.940 --> 39:22.526
I'm trying to put your life together.
You go out and pull a job?

39:22.610 --> 39:25.488
-You told them I sent you?
-Hell, no, I didn't! No.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.992
-Put your sleeves up.
-Yes, sir.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.870
I'm clean, sir.

39:34.288 --> 39:36.040
Now I'm gonna do
what I can for you, Stubby.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.542
<i>You made a mistake,</i>
<i>but that don't mean your life is over.</i>

39:38.626 --> 39:40.711
You understand?
I'm gonna try and help you.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.340
I understand. Can you keep me outside?

39:44.423 --> 39:45.925
Not gonna promise you that.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.427
You just get your mind ready
to do whatever comes around.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.929
Will, sir.

39:50.012 --> 39:51.514
-Where's Mitch?
-He got away.

39:51.597 --> 39:52.556
How'd he do that?

39:52.640 --> 39:55.059
He smelled it. He ran like hell.

39:55.142 --> 39:58.145
You sit tight. You keep your mouth shut!

39:59.688 --> 40:01.649
-Yes, sir.
-We understand each other, Stubby?

40:02.775 --> 40:05.319
Got my mind on it, Mr. Edwards.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.453
Way to deliver, Stub.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.122
That S.O.B.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.748
He's scared to death of the guy.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.126
Edwards! I'm talking about Edwards.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.921
You're starting from go, Mick.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.589
Guy you busted couldn't help us.

40:25.673 --> 40:29.009
Okay, uh,
what time will my backups position?

40:29.093 --> 40:30.094
45 minutes.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.929
<i>There's a greasy spoon,</i>

40:32.012 --> 40:33.305
on Decker and Utica.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.765
I'll move when I see him pull in.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.477
I'd take extra backups, Captain.

40:38.561 --> 40:39.937
It's only one guy, no?

40:40.020 --> 40:41.605
For after the bust.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.524
Edwards' clients may try to kill him.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.029
What do you want?

40:49.530 --> 40:51.949
-What happened?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.535
Stubby got arrested.
I nearly got arrested.

40:54.618 --> 40:55.786
What happened?

40:55.870 --> 40:57.997
-For what?
-The car you had us steal.

40:58.080 --> 40:58.914
Wait a minute.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.667
You're coming to your parole officer,
confessing a crime?

41:03.961 --> 41:05.921
All right? All right?

41:06.005 --> 41:08.632
Let's cut the crap. The boost went wrong.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.511
-Take it easy.
-No, I'm hot now. I got to leave town now!

41:12.595 --> 41:14.096
Let go! I'll take care of it!

41:14.180 --> 41:16.098
<i>Oh, you'll take care of it?</i>

41:16.807 --> 41:18.100
How?

41:18.184 --> 41:21.645
Two bills and an address. I'll show you
where you can boost some wheels.

41:21.729 --> 41:22.730
Let's pop him.

41:22.813 --> 41:23.647
Hang on, babe.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.941
If Mick's got his hands on him,
he can claim duress.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.610
Give me an address,
then you drop a dime to the cops.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.988
No, no, wait!
Come on, let go. I'm hypertensive.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.118
All right, I'm letting go.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.786
Attaboy, Mick.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.002
What did you go crazy for?

41:45.085 --> 41:46.212
I just did a pound.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.130
I'm not going back in again.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.592
Control that temper,
or you won't stay out very long.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.512
Come on, Edwards. Say something wrong.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.849
It's a nice maroon beamer.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.976
They go in Nevada
for three grand without paper.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.238
-You talk to Stubby?
-EDWARDS: They busted him.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.908
He'll be all right. Little geek's
too scared to give anybody up.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.702
-LARUE: That's it, Edwards.
-You're under arrest.

42:18.786 --> 42:21.455
Down! Get down on the floor!

42:21.997 --> 42:22.831
You're a creep!

42:26.210 --> 42:27.753
What happened, Mr. Edwards?

42:27.836 --> 42:29.797
-Somebody find out you're a crook?
-Hey.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.049
Hey, you're gonna last
a long time inside, Edwards.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.218
-You're gonna last at least a month.
-They love the guy.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.428
They're looking forward
to working with you, Ken.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.265
Oh, would one of you gentlemen

42:39.348 --> 42:41.267
like to be in the background
of this next shot?

42:41.350 --> 42:44.520
-Yes, ma'am, I believe I could be had.
-Take the vacant bike.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.896
Where's Dudley?

42:45.980 --> 42:48.983
Oh, he blew the last nine takes.
Roger canned him.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.570
Out of the ash heap
of another man's career,

42:52.653 --> 42:54.071
a star is born.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.365
Get off of me, you overgrown horse.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.908
-Get off of me!
-TAMARA: Roger!

42:57.992 --> 43:00.244
Teach you to fire me, you pansy!

43:00.327 --> 43:01.537
Dudley, what now?

43:01.620 --> 43:03.622
This here is a labor dispute, my man.

43:03.706 --> 43:07.835
Sure, he says give him severance pay,
or he sits on me.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.670
Man refuses to negotiate!

43:09.753 --> 43:11.463
I'm gonna have to bust you again, Dudley.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.882
Tell me it wasn't bad. Tell me I was good!

43:13.966 --> 43:18.137
Yeah, it had a certain, rough charm, okay?

43:18.220 --> 43:19.430
Stand up, Dudley, right now.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.307
Stand up right now
and give me that helmet.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.934
I want you to wait in the unit
with Officer Hill

43:24.018 --> 43:26.270
while I finish my acting debut.

43:26.353 --> 43:29.148
And then you're going away.
You understand me?

43:30.649 --> 43:31.692
HILL: Come on, Dudley.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.862
What's with always
sitting on guys, Dudley?

43:34.945 --> 43:36.488
It's a way of life, my man.

43:36.572 --> 43:39.533
(laughs)

43:39.617 --> 43:41.952
-(calm music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

43:43.537 --> 43:44.997
Hi, thanks for coming.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.957
Henry, for the housewarming.

43:47.791 --> 43:50.169
-Thank you.
-Henry, this is going to be wonderful.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.670
Look at all this space, Frank.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.922
Yeah, your business dollar
buys a little more space

43:54.006 --> 43:55.382
in a high-crime neighborhood.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.508
(laughs)

43:56.967 --> 43:59.511
Help me tap a keg in the kitchen, Frank?

43:59.595 --> 44:01.055
Uh? Sure.

44:07.811 --> 44:09.313
-(clears throat)
-Excited?

44:09.396 --> 44:10.689
I'm pretty excited...

44:12.274 --> 44:13.400
a little scared.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.820
You know, sometimes I'll be thinking,

44:17.738 --> 44:19.782
"This is great. This is a fresh start."

44:20.407 --> 44:22.368
Couple minutes later, I'll be thinking,

44:23.285 --> 44:25.746
"This is silly.
I got no business up here."

44:27.289 --> 44:29.333
But then I decide
I'll make it my business.

44:29.416 --> 44:30.709
Good for you.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.920
I feel the same thing
about this afternoon, Frank.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.923
You say it's not part of being a cop.

44:37.257 --> 44:38.550
I say I'm gonna make it part.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.552
-This isn't the time, Henry.
-I know.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.181
Thanks for coming.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.938
Henry, can a stranger
offer decorating advice?

44:51.647 --> 44:53.315
<i>-You </i>can.
-(chuckles)

44:53.399 --> 44:56.026
I saw a lamp that would be wonderful here.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.153
They're open weekends, not expensive.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.072
I think it's about $14.

45:00.155 --> 45:01.532
I'll check it out.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.123
Henry seems a little worked up.

45:13.335 --> 45:14.503
Space invaders!

45:18.549 --> 45:20.759
(laughing)

45:20.843 --> 45:23.303
Hey, I'm bigger than you,
and I got a bigger appetite.

45:23.387 --> 45:24.513
All right.

45:28.475 --> 45:30.352
What are Luce and my mom talking about?

45:31.061 --> 45:32.980
Talking about you and Luce
staying together.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.823
Joe, have you ever been high on smack?

45:42.906 --> 45:43.949
No.

45:52.624 --> 45:54.460
If she wanted me, I'd stay with her.

45:54.543 --> 45:55.794
But she doesn't.

45:55.878 --> 45:57.588
She just wants to be high.

45:58.964 --> 45:59.882
(exhales)

45:59.965 --> 46:01.467
Hey, Fabe, your mother loves you.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.094
She's just having problems.

46:04.178 --> 46:07.973
I'm never taking dope.
I'd be too afraid, Joe!

46:08.056 --> 46:09.892
If it's gonna stop me from loving people.

46:15.022 --> 46:17.357
BATES: I want us to understand
each other, Mrs. Dewitt.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.818
I want you to stay out of Fabian's life.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.320
I understand.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.365
And when this money runs out, I don't want
you coming here making trouble.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.617
I'm not gonna.

46:29.411 --> 46:33.415
This basically says that you're making me
Fabian's guardian

46:33.499 --> 46:35.751
so I can enroll him in school
and things like that.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.044
Where's my money?

46:41.006 --> 46:41.840
(knock on door)

46:41.924 --> 46:44.802
-COFFEY: Luce?
-Joe, come back in a minute.

46:44.885 --> 46:45.803
JOE: Yeah.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.889
Has he got Fabian?

46:49.681 --> 46:51.058
Let me see him.

46:51.141 --> 46:52.559
Joe, wait a minute!

47:00.150 --> 47:01.151
Come on in.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.447
Hi, Luce.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.615
Hi, Fabian.

47:07.282 --> 47:08.534
Hi, peach.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.035
Hi.

47:13.872 --> 47:17.084
Just wanted to say hello to you.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.045
See what your mother does for you?

47:20.128 --> 47:21.255
Mrs. Dewitt.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.965
Go away. Go do what you want.

47:23.048 --> 47:24.716
Mrs. Dewitt, why don't you just go?

47:26.426 --> 47:27.636
Okay.

47:32.391 --> 47:33.934
Take care of my baby.

47:40.566 --> 47:41.441
(door closes)

47:43.235 --> 47:45.195
(emotional music playing)

47:45.821 --> 47:47.739
(sighs) This is my home now.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.450
Yeah, this is it.

47:51.326 --> 47:53.120
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

48:03.589 --> 48:06.592
(theme music playing)
