Now, nobody's saying the Chatsworth
Estate is the Garden of Eden, but

00:05.420 --> 00:09.419
it's been a good home to us, to me,
Frank Gallagher, and me kids, who

00:10.620 --> 00:14.619
I'm proud of, cos every single one
of 'em reminds me a little of me.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.099
See, they can all
think for themselves,

00:18.100 --> 00:21.499
which they've got me to thank for.

00:21.500 --> 00:25.179
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why nobody calls him Phillip

00:25.180 --> 00:27.299
any more. Ian, lot like his mam,

00:27.300 --> 00:30.699
which is handy for the others, cos
she's disappeared into thin air.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.859
And Carl. We daren't let him grow
his hair for two reasons.

00:33.860 --> 00:36.899
One - it makes it stand on end
and makes him look like Toyah.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.899
Two - nits love him.
Debbie, sent by God, total Angel.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.259
You've to check your change, but
she'll go out of her way to do you
a favour.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.019
Plus little Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.020 --> 00:51.659
Sheila, me bird. Couldn't be happier.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.699
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.699
And fantastic neighbours, Kev and
Veronica. Lend ya anything.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.659
Well, almost anything. Carol
and Marty, the lodgers from hell.

01:01.660 --> 01:05.019
Last of the lonely hearts and
a psychologist's wet dream.

01:05.019 --> 01:06.659
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.660 --> 01:10.179
But all of 'em to a man know first
and foremost one of the most vital

01:10.180 --> 01:14.179
necessities in life is -
they know how to throw a party!

01:16.060 --> 01:17.339

The thing about surprises is -

01:25.840 --> 01:27.719
they're betterto give than to
receive.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.639
Like 18th birthday parties.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.639
The fun part is the planning. You
get to make the list, tick things

01:33.800 --> 01:35.719
off, delegate jobs and be in charge.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.079
While the other personyou're doing
it for just has

01:38.080 --> 01:40.999
to pretend they haven't noticed.
Which of course they always have.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.439
Debs!

01:42.440 --> 01:46.439

02:10.080 --> 02:12.279
Carl!

02:12.280 --> 02:15.999
Who's put that there?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.359
Who puts a fucking pizza on a seat?

02:18.360 --> 02:22.359
The real surprise in life, though,
you never get any warning about.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.399
Shit, shit, shit, shit...

02:38.400 --> 02:41.479
What the...?

02:41.480 --> 02:45.479
Oh, oh, fucking hell!

03:09.560 --> 03:13.559
WHIMPERING

03:15.640 --> 03:17.839
Is there a next of kin?

03:17.840 --> 03:21.839
There are two listed here, both
wives, which one should I call?

03:22.280 --> 03:26.279
Whichever one bloody answers!

03:29.360 --> 03:31.559
So, where's me present, then?

03:31.560 --> 03:35.559
You'll have to wait tilltomorrow,
down the Trafford Centre.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.199
Should I be worried?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.999
Dad, Mum, over here.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.999
Happy birthday, Philip.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.399
Here's my baby!
Aw, I knew you'd miss me...

04:36.280 --> 04:37.359
Take it, then.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.799
Thanks, Paddy.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.639
You're welcome.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.359
So... You're a grown man now, Philip.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.599
You've come of age.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.599
And with that comes responsibility.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.319
A knuckle duster.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.759
Shane, Micky...

05:00.760 --> 05:04.759
Come on, then... Bring the box.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.119
What the fuck you doing?

05:16.360 --> 05:17.999
A little birthday treat. Our way
of saying welcome to the clan.
No!

05:19.040 --> 05:23.759
Go on! Give him one!
You're joking!I'm not hitting
some random bloke!

05:23.760 --> 05:25.319
He owes us money, don't you?What?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.519
Which means he owes you, Philip.
You what?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.519
I haven't exactly noticed you turning
into Rockafella lately.

05:30.520 --> 05:34.519
And if you're gonna swan about,
sponging off me, there's some jobs
I want doing.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.599
Right.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.719
Give her to me!Eh?

05:47.720 --> 05:51.039
She's my daughter.
I'll support her. Her and Mandy.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.239
And I don't needhelp from you,
Paddy!

05:53.240 --> 05:55.679
Fine. Not another penny from us.
See how long you last.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.999
A lifetime.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.519
Mandy?

06:00.520 --> 06:01.999
I'm with Lip, Dad.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.399
Leave it.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.359
There's more than one
way to skin a cunt.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.599
I was just saying, Patrick. >

06:10.600 --> 06:14.599
Hasn't little Katie
got Frank's eyes?

06:21.040 --> 06:25.039
What's going on?Don't know.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.119
Nothing to see here. Just some drunk
who set fire to his dinner.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.119
Is he...?He's our dad.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.119
He'll be fine.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.399
Live another day to waste our time.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.399
You might wanna give him this.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.719
Come on, Liam.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.519
Just through here, Mrs Gallagher.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.999
We've given him some fluids,
pumped his stomach.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.199
And a rabies jab for the dog bites.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.199
Quite a night he's had.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.799
Oi!

07:33.800 --> 07:36.079
Open the fucking door!

07:36.080 --> 07:39.839
Kev, Kev! Veronica!

07:39.840 --> 07:41.079
There's no answer.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.799
They're still not back, Yvonneand
there's 12 bottles of milk there.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.759
Where the hell are they?
Booze run don't take this long.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.079
Look, I've told you!
I don't know where they are!

07:50.080 --> 07:53.359
Ow!

07:53.360 --> 07:54.519
All Marty said

07:54.520 --> 07:57.879
was they were going abroad and that
they were sharing the driving.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.679
Well, I lent 'em 200 quid.
And now I find out they've

08:00.680 --> 08:02.119
had 20 off of Lillian an all.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.239
And 500 off Jess.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.119
Oh, God, if they've done arunner,
I'll have to move!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.119
They haven't done a runner!

08:07.120 --> 08:09.959
Look, if Kev and Veronica were doing
a moonlight flit,

08:09.960 --> 08:11.159
they wouldn't takeMarty with 'em,
would they?

08:11.160 --> 08:14.199
they wouldn't takeMarty with 'em,
would they?
No, see?! So they'll be back.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.679
By...tonight, I think they said.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.879
They promised me!

08:19.880 --> 08:22.959
And they promised me
I'd have me money back last week.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.999
Three biggest lies, eh?
Big is beautiful,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.999
your cheque's in the post, and I
won't come in your fucking mouth.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.558
God! Women, eh?

08:38.559 --> 08:42.558
All is darkness without you till
you get a ring on their finger.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.479
Then they can't stand by
you in your hour of need.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.439
You set fire to your dinner, Frank!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.839
Be thankful she's there
the rest of the time.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.479
Oh! How silly of me
to think someone cares!

08:52.480 --> 08:55.999
But the fact is, your mother
would rather do a Latticework

08:56.000 --> 08:59.279
Pastries Of Denmark course
than save me from the flames.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.879
You should be on the stage.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.159
Same again please, Jess.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.159
All right, love.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.319
You're covered in sick!

09:10.320 --> 09:14.079
Son, you're ugly,
but tomorrow I shall be clean!

09:17.200 --> 09:18.599
Thanks, Jess!

09:18.600 --> 09:21.959
So what did you get him then, Frank?
BMW?

09:21.960 --> 09:25.679
What I give my kiddies,
money can't buy.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.719
That's handy.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.639
Oh, right... '89!

09:31.640 --> 09:34.519
CD from the year you were born.
Shall we put it on?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.719
Yeah, why not?Cheers, Jess.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.919
We nearly lost you in the womb,
Phillip.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.919
Yeah - Monica nigh on miscarried
when Margaret fuck you up the arse

09:44.640 --> 09:46.279
Thatcher fucked us up the arse

09:46.280 --> 09:48.559
by getting in for an "historic
third term".

09:48.560 --> 09:51.159
Thank fuck ecstasy turned up.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.159
Happy Mondays indeed!

09:53.160 --> 09:55.159
That's not right, Frank.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.639
She couldn't have been pregnant
at election time. That were '87.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.199
Look, Lillian, love,
do you not think...?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.759
11th of June 1987.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.439
That were my Brendan's 40th,

10:04.440 --> 10:07.159
but we had to cancel theparty,
we were depressed.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.159
So we went to Brighton instead,
great big hurricane, Brendan got

10:11.440 --> 10:15.359
hit with a flying beach hut.
Terrible year.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.359
Oh, that's right!
Cos you were born in '88.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.839
Cos we registered you a year after!

10:24.120 --> 10:26.839
Cos we were going to do it, but...

10:26.840 --> 10:29.799
But...?

10:29.800 --> 10:33.799
We ended up in Ladbrokes! Big win!

10:34.440 --> 10:36.879
Happy days.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.639
Yeah, we went out, got wankered...
Think Monica left you on a bus.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.239
So, you're saying I were
born in '88?

10:43.240 --> 10:45.839
You having a fuckin' laugh?!
That means I'm 19!

10:45.840 --> 10:48.599
18, 19... Whatever.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.799
Whatever? That's my fucking life!

10:51.800 --> 10:54.359
That means I went toschool
a year late!

10:54.360 --> 10:57.239
It means I were 18 a year ago...

10:57.240 --> 11:01.239
Happy birthday for last year, then.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.879
Mandy, Mandy...

11:12.880 --> 11:14.119
He's coming, Debbie...

11:14.120 --> 11:16.999
OK, quick then!

11:17.000 --> 11:19.199
Happy birthday!

11:19.200 --> 11:21.519
APPLAUSE

11:21.520 --> 11:24.999
Ta-da! Sorry about the cake,
Sheila's one got melted in the fire.

11:25.000 --> 11:25.879
Thanks to Dad.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.079
Don't worry about it! It's great.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.319
Mum!?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.839
Happy birthday!

11:36.240 --> 11:40.239
Well, I'm not gonna miss Lip's...
19th birthday, am I?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.159
Happy birthday, darling.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.799
Well, you missed Fiona's.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.559
You always miss 'em.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.399
You never even send a card.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.239
Yeah, well that was the past.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.319
I'm here now. So happy birthday!

11:53.320 --> 11:54.999
Someone going to get us a drink?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.799
Yeah, I'll go and get it now.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.959
Thanks. >

11:57.960 --> 12:00.919
Er, Mum. This is Mandy.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.399
Oh, all right, Mandy?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.319
Have you got him a present, then?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.399
Oh, yeah - I've got you all presents.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.399
This is for Debbie
and this is for Carl...

12:14.920 --> 12:16.799
Oh, yeah, and this is for Liam...

12:16.800 --> 12:18.159
Where's Norma?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.639
Well, I'm not gonna
bring Norma, am I?!

12:20.640 --> 12:23.479
Well, you usually do.
She is your girlfriend.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.479
We're not joined at the hip, Debbie.
Go on then! Open your prezzies.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.439
Here, Mum.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.439
Oh, ta, love.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.079
You can cut the act now, Mum.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.959
Norma's thrown you out, hasn't she?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.559
No.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.679
Oh, yeah?
Then why is all your stuff outside?

12:59.680 --> 13:02.519
You've not come back for
Lip's birthday at all!

13:02.520 --> 13:06.519
Not just that, no, Debbie,
but Norma hasn't thrown me out.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.639
I've left her.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.359
I've come back. To be with my babies.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.359
For good.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.639
Debbie, we can't kick her out.
It's still technically her house.

13:23.640 --> 13:27.159
She can't just come back
whenever she feels like it.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.799
She hasn't even said sorry.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.559
Well, I'm glad she's back.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.559
She'll just take over and she won't
pay her own way. Will you just
tell her that it's not a hotel?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.799
I can't, Debs. Look, you're
just gonna have to ignore her.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.679
Hopefully she'll fuck off soon.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.679
I'm not going to deny Katie
a grandma. I'm sorry.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.799
Wicked!

13:55.800 --> 13:56.159

Fuck!

13:56.160 --> 13:57.959

the situation regarding
the English couple today?

14:46.440 --> 14:50.439
We at the Foreign Office are doing
everything in our power to get
the two British nationals extradited,

14:51.520 --> 14:55.079
and we believe there's
every hope of success.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.919
(VERONICA) Get off me!

14:56.920 --> 15:00.919
Get off me!

15:01.520 --> 15:02.999
Oof!

15:03.000 --> 15:04.039
Come on, V! >

15:04.040 --> 15:05.759
Cool!

15:05.760 --> 15:07.359
(KEV) She didn't mean that! >

15:07.360 --> 15:11.359
Hey, we're innocent! Get off her!

15:12.560 --> 15:16.479
On the other hand, I think
they could be looking at six years.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.159
He's my son, he's my son!

15:19.160 --> 15:21.039
We paid good money for him!

15:21.040 --> 15:23.399
Fucking hell, Kev!

15:23.400 --> 15:26.839
Looks like the end of my money, then.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.839
Hey, neither a lender
nor borrower be, Jez.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.559
Is there any chance of getting
another drink?

15:33.560 --> 15:37.559
Oh, my god. I don't believe it.
Me own daughter, a criminal!

15:37.640 --> 15:41.639
Sue, did you know owt about this?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.639
They made me promise not to say.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.359
Oh, God, what've they done?!

15:48.360 --> 15:51.319
And these are your neighbours?

15:51.320 --> 15:52.719
CLATTERING

15:52.720 --> 15:56.719
What now?!

16:01.600 --> 16:05.599
What the...?! What d'you think you're
doing? This is my daughter's house!

16:05.640 --> 16:07.719
Bit slow off the mark, aren't you?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.519
You wanna get yourself Sky News.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.919
We heard about this house going
at six o'clock this morning.

16:11.920 --> 16:12.959
We heard about this house going
at six o'clock this morning.
You what?

16:12.960 --> 16:15.159
Eh, you should be made up.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.039
Council could've had
any riffraff in here, eh, Paddy?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.439
What?! You can't do this!

16:21.440 --> 16:22.719
This is Kev and Veronica's stuff!

16:22.720 --> 16:25.119
This is Kev and Veronica's stuff!
Well, they're in
fucking jail, darling!

16:25.120 --> 16:27.319
Look, Paddy, you can't just
start taking over the place.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.559
Look, Paddy, you can't just
start taking over the place.
You tell him, Lip!

16:28.560 --> 16:30.719
Who's gonna stop me,
Mr Tough Guy? You?

16:30.720 --> 16:32.959
I'm Monica, Lip's mum.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.959
Cos the thing is, when my wee Mandy
gets sick and tired of being cramped
in there with you lot,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.479
she's got somewhere else to go.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.479
Handy, Katie's grandparents being
right next door, isn't it?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.279
Blinding bit of luck.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.319
Oh, so that's what
all this is about!

16:47.320 --> 16:49.959
You just wanna be here,
breathing down our necks.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.439
Watching as you fail.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.599
Looking after our own.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.359
Oh, the leopard coat, where is it?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.799
I haven't thrown that out yet.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.279
Oh, well, it wouldn't
fit you, would it?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.118
Oh, well, you can wear it, then.

17:05.119 --> 17:09.118
On yer face. >

17:13.800 --> 17:15.638
You're never out the bog these days.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.598
Yeah, well, they said thyroid
can make you go a bit.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.799
Come on, Jez, you're about to pop.
I'm not that thick.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.239
Right, not a word to anyone
or you're dead meat.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.279
And how long do you think
you can keep that a secret for?

17:28.280 --> 17:30.559
I've managed for seven months.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.159
Couple of tents upstairs.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.999
So, you let a bloke...?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.559
So, you let a bloke...?
Did I fuck!

17:37.560 --> 17:41.559
The only thing got spunked was
a huge wad of cash. They're a nice
couple, can't have their own.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.999
Earn while I earn. Good bracket,
this surrogacy business.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.999
Eh, top tip - free dental care.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.799
Might get me bridge done.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.799
You should start with your brain!

17:56.080 --> 17:57.239
Two more.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.439
Nearly.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.479
What are you doing, you soft thing?!

18:00.480 --> 18:04.479
What are you doing, you soft thing?!
Ssh, come on, come on.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.879
Nearly there, nearly there.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.879
Forward, forward, forward,
forward, forward, stop.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.039
One more step. There we go.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.479
Ta-da!

18:24.480 --> 18:26.359
Oh, Paddy!

18:26.360 --> 18:30.359
I don't believe it!

18:31.960 --> 18:35.959
I thought we'd celebrate
our new home in style.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.079
You, you would not keep
your clothes on.

18:49.080 --> 18:53.079
Straight on the floor
and then slapping your nappies
up against the wall.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.999
What was I like?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.399
You were no trouble.
No, Liam was the difficult one.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.399
Had terrible postnatal
depression, and...

19:03.400 --> 19:06.159
Well, your dad was no help.
Just took all me pills.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.519
Left me in total misery.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.799
Debs, I'm hungry.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.639
Get Mum to make you some breakfast.

19:11.640 --> 19:15.639
It's no problem. Have to be veggie,
though, cos I don't touch meat.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.079
I don't mind.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.399
Let's see what we've got.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.559
Morning, Mandy, Lip. Cup of tea?

19:21.560 --> 19:24.359
Yeah. Thanks.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.359
Pass me the sick bucket.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.879
I heard that, Debbie.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.479
Good.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.679
She's right though, Mum.
We deserve an explanation.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.239
Why are you back?

19:38.240 --> 19:42.239
I know this is going to
take a little bit of time
to work through...

19:42.920 --> 19:44.199
You've had six years.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.399
And four months.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.319
Look, this has been very difficult
for me. Very traumatic.

19:51.320 --> 19:55.319
It's been torture for me,
having to leave you lot
and then moving to Moston

19:55.600 --> 19:59.599
and rattling around inside
that great big house when I was used
to kids and mess and noise and...

20:01.560 --> 20:05.559
Anyway, if you love someone,
you forgive them, don't you?

20:21.760 --> 20:25.759
It's all right, Debbie. I know it
might take you a little bit longer.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.639
Do you want to go shopping?

20:41.120 --> 20:44.719
Hello? >

20:44.720 --> 20:48.719
And how is my little
princess this morning?

20:48.920 --> 20:52.919
All the better for seeing you.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.159
Now then, what do you think
to a full-mirrored ceiling?

21:05.920 --> 21:09.919
Fabulous. As long as you're on top.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.639
Put your tea down!

21:20.360 --> 21:24.359
What the fuck do you want?
You're supposed to be on a job.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.559
Breakfast.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.279
# Don't you wish your girlfriend
was hot like me? #

21:39.920 --> 21:42.399
Couldn't we just kill her?
That'd get rid of her.

21:42.400 --> 21:46.399
Yeah, lead pipe, rope
or candlestick? Keep an eye out.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.439
(SIGHS)

22:14.760 --> 22:16.359
Debbie?

22:16.360 --> 22:20.359
What are you doing?

22:21.920 --> 22:25.919
Well, for your information,
Debbie, Norma isn't at home.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.839
She's actually driving
a lorry to Germany.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.319
And she doesn't have a mobile.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.319
Thinks they make you infertile!

22:36.520 --> 22:37.999
Now listen, love.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.999
I know you've been a bit funny
with me, but really we do
have to learn to get along.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.999
How did Norma take it? You leaving?

22:47.200 --> 22:51.199
Naturally she was very upset,
but she's had to learn to accept it.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.279
What were you rowing about?

22:54.280 --> 22:58.279
Everything.
She's always going on...

22:59.000 --> 23:02.999
Actually, Debbie, I don't really want
to get into it. It's very painful,
having to leave somebody.

23:04.280 --> 23:08.279
Just be thankful
that you're too young to know.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.999
Right, I think
I'd better ring a plumber.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.519
Good to see you made it
to Lip's party, then.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.519
Last night. Mum managed.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.559
Fuck off!

23:28.560 --> 23:30.479
Here for good, apparently.

23:30.480 --> 23:34.479
She's come home.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.199
Monica?

23:39.560 --> 23:40.879
Back here?

23:40.880 --> 23:44.159
Ah, you can show her
your wedding photos, Frank.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.159
Cos what I've heard off Kev,
she'd be very interested in those,
seeing she's still married to you.

23:48.840 --> 23:52.839
Yeah, yeah, all right,
just get us another pint
and a couple of these, Jez.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.959
This had better be
a quick one before shopping.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.599
Debbie, Debbie.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.999
What the fuck does your mother want?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.599
I don't know.
But she's up to summat. Jez?

24:09.600 --> 24:13.599
Any chance I can use your CB radio?

24:16.080 --> 24:20.079
(RADIO) This is Jockey Bird calling
Big Beaver, do you copy?

24:21.480 --> 24:24.119
Hey, hey, Jockey Bird. Long time!

24:24.120 --> 24:26.599
Speak up, me ballet dancer's
broken. Over.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.719
Some buddy boy blow
your doors off, did he?

24:29.720 --> 24:30.399
(NORMA) Hah, hah!

24:30.400 --> 24:31.439
(NORMA) Hah, hah!
Jez!

24:31.440 --> 24:35.239
Big Beaver, I've got
an ankle biter here that wants
a yapper in your big hole...

24:35.240 --> 24:36.919
Norma, it's Debbie.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.679
Hey. No first-personal, breaker.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.479
They're reading all my mail here.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.839
(DEBBIE) Mum's back.
She said she's staying.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.119
Did you throw her out?

24:46.120 --> 24:47.399
Over.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.199
Did I fuck!

24:49.200 --> 24:51.319
She's gone nowhere,
you cheeky little...

24:51.320 --> 24:55.319
Hey, you're making this up.
My Mon's at the base station
where I left her. Ten-four.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.239
T-That's a negative, Big Beaver.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.679
Ankle Biter's straight up.

25:00.680 --> 25:04.679
Your good buddy Beaver's
returned to the Village of the Damned
and Alligator Radio.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.159
I think she needs you
to fight for her, Norma.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.559
I'll put some motion lotion
in me pickle park

25:12.560 --> 25:15.799
and stand on the hammer
of my triple digit ride
for the fastest ever flip flop.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.519
Out.

25:19.520 --> 25:23.519
She's coming home.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.959
Hey, what you doing,
you cheeky bastard?!

25:26.960 --> 25:27.999
Hey, what you doing,
you cheeky bastard?!
What?!

25:28.000 --> 25:31.999
Mum, two o'clock.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.919
Have you seen your dad?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.559
Why do you want him?

25:38.560 --> 25:40.519
Don't matter. It'll keep.

25:40.520 --> 25:44.519
He'll be in soon enough. We'll just
have to wait here, won't we, Katie?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.519
What are you having?

25:46.520 --> 25:49.839
Erm, I'll have a juice. Pineapple.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.319
With vodka in it, thanks.

25:51.320 --> 25:51.719
Double?

25:51.720 --> 25:55.719
Yeah, why not?

26:00.080 --> 26:03.159
Ooh, look at you!

26:03.160 --> 26:04.599
It's nice.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.279
Yeah. But we need to talk.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.279
What's all this about, eh?

26:10.280 --> 26:14.279
Unless you've been and robbed
a bank, there's no way
we can afford this.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.919
No, you're right, we can't.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.919
It's always been my fantasy
to shag a man in a suit.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.039
Happy birthday!

26:25.040 --> 26:29.039
Thanks.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.279
Can you fuck off
downstairs for an hour?

26:40.280 --> 26:42.079
15 minute is enough.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.439
Who's he?!

26:43.440 --> 26:45.639
Plumber. Oh, I need
some comfort, Sue.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.199
My daughter's in prison.
I'm a broken woman.

26:48.200 --> 26:52.199
You think sharing a room
with Tutankhamun Does Deep Throat
is making my day?

26:52.200 --> 26:54.679
Why not you stay, too?

26:54.680 --> 26:58.679
Ugh!

27:02.000 --> 27:05.999
Is this where you keep
your little stopcock?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.399
Up your arse!

27:12.400 --> 27:15.999
Marty! Oh, Marty! Thank God!

27:16.000 --> 27:19.999
I've got something for you.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.499
Kev set it up on the internet.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.339
So, we drove over, but as soon
as we handed the money to

27:36.340 --> 27:38.419
the orphanage owner, we got raided.

27:38.420 --> 27:40.579
Shit.

27:40.580 --> 27:44.219
Veronica grabbed the baby and
stuffed him in the car with me,

27:44.220 --> 27:48.219
but the cops grabbed 'em. Veronica
was yelling, "drive, fuck off!

27:48.300 --> 27:52.059
"Fucking drive", so I did!
I drove off and left 'em.

27:52.060 --> 27:54.059
Fucking turncoat!

27:54.060 --> 27:56.819
You would've been
nicked if you hadn't.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.259
I didn't know what to do.

27:58.260 --> 28:02.259
I was too scared to drive the car
back so I hitched.

28:05.820 --> 28:07.499
Fuck it!

28:07.500 --> 28:09.579

(BABY CRYING)

28:26.900 --> 28:29.739
When did you last sleep, Marty?

28:29.740 --> 28:31.579
Dunno.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.699
Why won't he stop crying?

28:33.700 --> 28:35.779
I haven't hurt him, have I?

28:35.780 --> 28:37.499
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna keep it?

28:37.500 --> 28:39.259
Course not.I want to.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.819
Debbie?

28:42.820 --> 28:45.219
What's going on with
all that crying?!

28:45.220 --> 28:49.099
It's Katie. She doesn't like
having strangers in the house.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.579
I am not a stranger, Debbie.

28:51.580 --> 28:55.579
And I do not appreciate you putting
my cashmere jumper on a boil wash!

28:57.300 --> 28:58.859
Is that not what it goes on?

28:58.860 --> 29:02.859
I don't know how much longer I
can put up with this, Debbie.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.499
He's stopped crying.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.019
He likes you.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.299
No, he doesn't!

29:09.300 --> 29:12.539
Yeah, he does! Look.

29:12.540 --> 29:14.259
See?

29:14.260 --> 29:15.579
He wants you to be his mum.

29:15.580 --> 29:19.579
Marty! You're being insane!

29:40.060 --> 29:41.979
All right, Frank?

29:41.980 --> 29:45.459
Monica!

29:45.460 --> 29:49.459
We've got some catching up to do.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.619
Who'd have thought it eh, Frank?

29:53.620 --> 29:57.259
Little Lip, 19,
you and me grandparents.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.259
We don't seem old enough, do we?

30:00.260 --> 30:02.259
He's had it easy, though, in't he?

30:02.260 --> 30:05.459
I mean kids these days,
they don't know they're born.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.939
When I was Lip's age, I'd done time,
got crabs,

30:07.940 --> 30:10.539
knocked up sixgirls,
fought off bailiffs.

30:10.540 --> 30:13.779
Not many kids these days
can say that, can they?

30:13.780 --> 30:16.099
Remember when we met, Frank?

30:16.100 --> 30:18.619
1979, Ripper year.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.339
They had you in four times.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.379
They had you in four times.
God, like it was yesterday.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.339
Thought you'd stood me up,
thought you weren't interested.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.539
Me? No, course I was!

30:28.540 --> 30:31.859
Then I proposed to you.
Outside Aytoun dole office.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.899
Thought I was up the duff.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.899
Never thought you'd say yes,
but you did.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.179
And we got married.

30:41.180 --> 30:43.579
So, have the kids said
anything to you about,

30:43.580 --> 30:46.419
you know, eh, Sheila and me?

30:46.420 --> 30:47.699
Sheila?

30:47.700 --> 30:51.539
Yeah.What sort of thing?

30:51.540 --> 30:53.779
I do!

30:53.780 --> 30:56.659
I never got the divorce through
from Monica in the end,

30:56.660 --> 30:58.419
so it's not legal anyway.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.499
Anyway, I better go

31:00.500 --> 31:04.459
and get the twins from Debbie.
Don't want to take advantage.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.979
Actually, Frank,
I think I'll come with you.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.339
I'd like to see where
you live properly.

31:09.340 --> 31:11.419
Yeah, but the thing is,

31:11.420 --> 31:15.419
you know, it's, you know, Sheila,
me girlfriend, she'll probably...

31:15.620 --> 31:19.619
Yeah, but she's away doing a cookery
course, isn't she? Kids told me.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.699
Well, yeah, but she just probably
wouldn't in, in effect, but she...

31:23.860 --> 31:26.259
Come on.See ya.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.979
Sue, please?

31:27.980 --> 31:29.979
We'd be a proper family.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.779
I don't know what that is, Marty!

31:31.780 --> 31:33.659
We don't know anything
about looking after a baby!

31:33.660 --> 31:35.499
But we could learn.

31:35.500 --> 31:39.499
And then there's thepolice,
social services.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.259
Look, Kev and Veronica bought him.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.579
Someone else would.
You could sell him.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.419
What, on eBay?

31:47.420 --> 31:51.379
All right, leave him at maternity!
They'll take care of him.

31:51.380 --> 31:55.339
You've got my number, Pawel.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.379
Ooh, what a man!

31:57.380 --> 31:59.459
Big hands, he had, did you see?

31:59.460 --> 32:02.699
Saucy bugger!

32:02.700 --> 32:04.379
Oh, my God, Marty!

32:04.380 --> 32:07.659
Oh, thank the Good Lord!

32:07.660 --> 32:09.619
I've been beside meself!

32:09.620 --> 32:12.779
You've no idea what you've put me...

32:12.780 --> 32:14.699
Tell me you didn't bring that back.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.419
Yeah, I have. Your grandson.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.579
He's no grandson of mine!

32:19.580 --> 32:21.939
People'll think I have
foreign blood in me!

32:21.940 --> 32:23.619
You didn't seem to mind last night.

32:23.620 --> 32:25.659
He's from Basingstoke!

32:25.660 --> 32:28.339
Mum, I want to keep him.
You'll help me, won't you?

32:28.340 --> 32:31.219
Marty Fisher, you
can't even keep a job!

32:31.220 --> 32:33.139
And she's no better!

32:33.140 --> 32:34.459
I'm not getting involved.

32:34.460 --> 32:38.459
She's right. I'm sorry, Marty,but
for once, me and your mum agree.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.459
Sorry, Billy.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.539
KLAXON

32:44.540 --> 32:48.539
Oh, Norma!

32:51.820 --> 32:55.819
Someone to see you, Mum.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.539
Norma.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.019
Oh, well I'll...

33:00.020 --> 33:03.459
What d'you think you're doing?
What's all this about leaving me?

33:03.460 --> 33:05.419
What d'you think you're doing?
What's all this about leaving me?
Deb, twins.
Kitchen.

33:05.420 --> 33:06.659
What're you doin' here?

33:06.660 --> 33:07.779
Debbie got us on the CB.
Obviously confused...

33:07.780 --> 33:10.539
Debbie got us on the CB.
Obviously confused...
I told you not to interfere!

33:10.540 --> 33:12.219
Well, it's good job she did!

33:12.220 --> 33:15.939
You've lost your bloodymarbles,
you have!

33:15.940 --> 33:18.779
Hey, hey, is this about that
lazy-eyed shelf stacker?

33:18.780 --> 33:19.979
You what?

33:19.980 --> 33:22.019
The one you wasflirting with
in Iceland.

33:22.020 --> 33:25.499
She was helping me reach
the raspberry ripple!

33:25.500 --> 33:27.459
Which is more than you were doing!

33:27.460 --> 33:29.899
I've told you, thatcrap is full of
e numbers.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.339
I don't care! I wanted it!

33:32.340 --> 33:34.179
I'm not a child, Norma!

33:34.180 --> 33:36.619
I can decide for meself what I want!

33:36.620 --> 33:40.619
All right, all right, we'll get
you a fucking raspberry ripple!

33:40.660 --> 33:44.419
And all the other shite you've been
banging on about. Don't blame me

33:44.420 --> 33:47.259
when you get polycystic ovaries.

33:47.260 --> 33:51.259
Right, now get your bag,
you daft bint and hurry home.

33:51.940 --> 33:55.939
I'm not coming home, Norma.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.539
I'm staying with me family.

33:58.540 --> 33:59.819
What?

33:59.820 --> 34:03.819
I meant it.
God's spoken to me, sort of.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.099
I've had an epiphany.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.179
Ugh!

34:07.180 --> 34:10.539
Ugh!
No, Norma, don't listen!
She'll get you whatever you want.

34:10.540 --> 34:11.819
Won't you, Norma?

34:11.820 --> 34:15.819
You can't stay here anyway! It's too
cramped and we don't want you here!

34:16.300 --> 34:20.018
Oh, that's right! Hate me!

34:20.020 --> 34:22.779
Punish me forever
for one fucking mistake!

34:22.780 --> 34:26.779
I'm such a bad mother, aren't I?!
Such a bad fucking person!

34:27.219 --> 34:29.099
Hey. It's all right. Calm down.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.539
How can I, when she hates me!

34:31.540 --> 34:34.899
And she runs circles round
me, so I can't think straight.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.779
She doesn't hate you, Mum.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.179
None of us do.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.619
I don't understand
what this is about?!

34:40.620 --> 34:43.619
Which one of you did this?!
I'll fucking have you!

34:43.620 --> 34:46.018
Oh, for Christ's sake, Norma!

34:46.020 --> 34:50.018
Nothing I do is ever good enough!

34:50.860 --> 34:53.018
And it's so hard,

34:53.020 --> 34:56.379
being gay.

34:56.380 --> 35:00.379
You don't know how hard it is, Ian.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.979
It's the right thing to do, Marty.

35:21.220 --> 35:25.219
On the way home, he kept shaking.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.499
They all do it in the orphanage.

35:30.340 --> 35:34.339
It's what they do when
they've never had any love.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.659
Euh!

35:39.660 --> 35:42.539
Leaky tit!

35:42.540 --> 35:44.339
Open up in there, it's the police!

35:44.340 --> 35:46.619
Oh, I'm not parked on
a double yellow, am I?

35:46.620 --> 35:49.619
We're looking for Marty Fisher!

35:49.620 --> 35:53.619
Come on, you tit!

35:55.940 --> 35:58.019
Stan, what can we do for you?

35:58.020 --> 35:59.579
PC Waterman to you,
and don't you forget it.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.499
PC Waterman to you,
and don't you forget it.
You what?

36:01.500 --> 36:04.059
PC Waterman.
And this is my new PC, Tom O'Leary.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.499
Well, where is he then?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.779
Oh, I've not seen either of 'em for
weeks, Stan, I'm out of me mind!

36:09.780 --> 36:11.899
Well we've been tipped off that
he's here with a stolen baby, so...

36:11.900 --> 36:13.139
What?

36:13.140 --> 36:15.499
We've had a call from Monica?
Where's Monica?!

36:15.500 --> 36:17.739
No, Stan!

36:17.740 --> 36:21.739
Sorry, PC Waterman.
Not without a warrant.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.499
Stay here. I'm going to get one.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.499
Off the premises, if you don't mind.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.539
You fucking tipped off the police!

36:37.540 --> 36:40.579
What are you talking about?

36:40.580 --> 36:44.419
I didn't even know
there was a baby here!

36:44.420 --> 36:47.499
Debbie? Tell me you didn't?

36:47.500 --> 36:51.179
No, she wouldn't, would you, Debs?

36:51.180 --> 36:54.419
I thought...
if I pretended to be her...

36:54.420 --> 36:57.419
What the fuck are you playing at?
How could you do that?!

36:57.420 --> 37:01.419
Why do you think?! Because she
is abitch that abandoned us,

37:01.660 --> 37:04.259
but youdon't seem to care
about that!

37:04.260 --> 37:08.259
She's going to do it again!

37:08.900 --> 37:12.899
I thought, if you thought it was
herthen you might make her leave!

37:15.700 --> 37:19.299
Well, don't look at me,
it's not my fault!

37:19.300 --> 37:22.219
Marty, you'll have to get outof
here. Take him to maternity.

37:22.220 --> 37:26.219
I'll meet you later.Debbie?

37:26.740 --> 37:30.739
Debbie...

37:31.500 --> 37:33.019
I'm sorry, Marty!

37:33.020 --> 37:37.019
You're my friend andI've
done something horrible!

37:38.780 --> 37:42.779
It's OK, it's OK.

37:44.780 --> 37:46.339
I know you didn't mean it.

37:46.340 --> 37:50.339
Fucking bitch!

37:50.380 --> 37:52.619
It'll be all right.

37:52.620 --> 37:56.619
Marty,
you're gonna have to go, mate.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.939
It'll be all right.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.819
Marty? >

38:04.820 --> 38:07.459
Don't abandon him.

38:07.460 --> 38:10.099
Please.

38:10.100 --> 38:14.099
Marty, come on!
Stan'll be back any minute.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.939
Oh, my children!

38:21.940 --> 38:24.939
Why is God punishing me?!

38:24.940 --> 38:28.939
It's all right, Carol. We're not
gonna throw you out just cos the
rest of your family's gone.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.339
See you later.

38:39.340 --> 38:42.059
Ha! Gotcha! Don't need a
warrant out here, do I?!

38:42.060 --> 38:43.099
Sue!Marty!

38:43.100 --> 38:44.099
Sue!

38:49.180 --> 38:50.819
Romanian coppers are on their way.

38:50.820 --> 38:54.819
But it's not the baby they want!
Pants on fire!

38:55.300 --> 38:59.299
Oh, for Pete's sake! Is there not
a WPC in here anywhere?

39:00.780 --> 39:02.339
Who are you?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.939
I'm the baby's mother.
Can I have him please, Stan?

39:04.940 --> 39:05.459
What you talking about?!

39:05.460 --> 39:07.099
PC Waterman!

39:07.100 --> 39:10.099
Yeah, PC...
But you haven't got a baby, Sue!

39:10.100 --> 39:12.299
What's this then, blow-up monkey?

39:12.300 --> 39:16.019
Hello. Aw, come here... He's hungry.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.699
He wants his mummy...

39:17.700 --> 39:21.299
Is she lying?
She's lying, isn't she?

39:21.300 --> 39:25.299
If that's your baby,
then where's its birth certificate?

39:25.340 --> 39:27.379
Here.

39:27.380 --> 39:31.299
Oh... sorry.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.139
You don't think I'd do this
if he wasn't mine, do you?

39:34.140 --> 39:35.459
Suck a tit!

39:35.460 --> 39:36.659
Now look, Sue.
We know that baby's stolen so.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.419
No, he's not!

39:38.420 --> 39:42.419
And even if he was, he's an orphan,
so you can't send him back to...

39:43.340 --> 39:44.979
I didn't know he was an orphan!

39:44.980 --> 39:45.499
That's not the point, PC O'Leary!

39:45.500 --> 39:48.379
But it is.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.019
I know what that's like.

39:51.020 --> 39:54.739
I never even knew me mam and dad!
It's fucking awful!

39:54.740 --> 39:58.419
We can't send him back!

39:58.420 --> 39:59.699
Please Stan?

39:59.700 --> 40:03.699
Piss in your tea!

40:10.020 --> 40:14.019
Save the baby?

40:15.020 --> 40:19.019
Well, it looks like we must've
made a terrible mistake then.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.059
So are we really
gonna keep him, then?!

40:34.060 --> 40:37.339
We have to do it properly though
Marty. I'm not living with your mum.

40:37.340 --> 40:37.899
Slag.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.099
And we need the proper stuff.
I'm not slumming it.

40:41.100 --> 40:44.099
We'll need a three-wheel baby buggy,
proper car seat...

40:44.100 --> 40:45.819
We have to get a car first!

40:45.820 --> 40:48.539
A nice one. And I was thinking maybe
then we could adopt another one.

40:48.540 --> 40:49.139
Hey?

40:49.140 --> 40:51.139
Well, child benefit's 70 a month,

40:51.140 --> 40:52.499
per child. Oooh!

40:52.500 --> 40:54.059
What's the matter?

40:54.060 --> 40:56.539
Nothing, just a bit of
morning sickness, I think.

40:56.540 --> 41:03.659
So, if we had four, that would be
280. If we had six, that would 670.

41:03.660 --> 41:04.179
Say what you said before?

41:04.180 --> 41:05.459
Morning sickness.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.979
Does that mean me spunk works?!

41:06.980 --> 41:08.419
(LAUGHS)

41:08.420 --> 41:09.459
I don't believe it!

41:09.460 --> 41:13.459
Marty!

41:15.100 --> 41:17.339
What you doing with her?! Get out!

41:17.340 --> 41:20.659
She's just brought her back, Lip.
She had her for the afternoon.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.739
She's my granddaughter.
You can't stop me from seeing her,

41:23.740 --> 41:25.499
it'd break me heart!
I'm begging you...

41:25.500 --> 41:28.139
It's not her fault you had
a row with Paddy, is it?

41:28.140 --> 41:29.939
Don't punish her for it.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.579
Three visits a week.
That's all I want.

41:32.580 --> 41:35.179
You don't interfere though.

41:35.180 --> 41:39.059
Hey, what's the matter?

41:39.060 --> 41:41.219
What the fuck is that?!

41:41.220 --> 41:43.019
Sweet, isn't it?

41:43.020 --> 41:44.539
Ahhh...

41:44.540 --> 41:48.539
TATTOOIST NEEDLE WHIRRS

41:49.500 --> 41:53.499
I didn't tell her she could do it.

42:01.460 --> 42:05.459
Sorry about that
little interruption...

42:05.700 --> 42:07.499
Ooh, dear!

42:07.500 --> 42:11.499
Oh, yeah. Just some kids. Threw
something through the letterbox.
Cunts.

42:12.860 --> 42:15.819
No, they didn't.
You set fire to your dinner.

42:15.820 --> 42:17.179
No!

42:17.180 --> 42:18.859
They told me at the hospital.

42:18.860 --> 42:20.939
They couldn't get hold of your wife,

42:20.940 --> 42:22.819
Sheila Gallagher.

42:22.820 --> 42:25.979
So they had to get hold of your ex.

42:25.980 --> 42:27.859
How do you think that
made me feel,

42:27.860 --> 42:30.659
knowing that
I'm still married to you?

42:30.660 --> 42:31.979
I want you back Frank.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.019
PHONE RINGS

42:33.020 --> 42:34.859
That's why I'm here.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.379
I want my old life back.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.899
Let me just...

42:38.900 --> 42:40.979
Hello?

42:40.980 --> 42:43.459
'Hiya, love.'

42:43.460 --> 42:45.659
Oh, hiya, Sheila.

42:45.660 --> 42:47.019
'Is there something wrong?'

42:47.020 --> 42:48.819
What?

42:48.820 --> 42:50.339
'You don't sound yourself.'

42:50.340 --> 42:51.739
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

42:51.740 --> 42:53.379
'Nothing's happened has it?'

42:53.380 --> 42:55.539
What round here.
Must be joking ain't you.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.939
Same old, same old, innit.

42:56.940 --> 42:57.979
'Guess what happened...'

42:57.980 --> 42:59.659
'Guess what happened...'
(You and me.)

42:59.660 --> 43:00.979
What?

43:00.980 --> 43:01.499
What?
'Frank?'

43:01.500 --> 43:03.619
What?
'Frank?'
No, no... what?

43:03.620 --> 43:05.099
(You and me.)

43:05.100 --> 43:06.499
'Is there someone there?'

43:06.500 --> 43:10.379
No, no, it's just a...
no, it's just a soap on the telly.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.379
I dropped the phone.

43:12.380 --> 43:16.379
'Is it that time already?
My cinnamon swirls will be burnt.'

43:18.380 --> 43:22.099
Yeah, so, er...
so when is it that you coming back?

43:22.100 --> 43:23.979
'Tomorrow, love.'

43:23.980 --> 43:25.139
Tomorrow.

43:25.140 --> 43:26.179
'It's Monday.'

43:26.180 --> 43:30.179
Is it?

43:33.020 --> 43:35.859
Look Debs,

43:35.860 --> 43:39.859
we want you to decide
if Mum stays or not.

43:40.940 --> 43:43.379
Just say the word.

43:43.380 --> 43:47.379
And she's gone.

43:53.620 --> 43:56.179
And you'll go?

43:56.180 --> 44:00.179
If I tell you to?

44:22.460 --> 44:26.459
I need to get the dinner on.

44:48.260 --> 44:49.899
So you're off then, are you?

44:49.900 --> 44:51.619
Am I fuck!

44:51.620 --> 44:55.299
You might have come over all Stepford
Wives, but I'm not falling for it.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.419
I'm stopping right here
till you come to your senses!

44:58.420 --> 45:02.419
Right where I can see you.

45:02.860 --> 45:06.859
Oh, squatters' rights,
European Rules!

45:17.740 --> 45:20.659
'Surprises come in lots of
different shapes and sizes.

45:20.660 --> 45:23.979
'There's the good ones like finding
out you've passed your maths exam

45:23.980 --> 45:27.379
'even though the calculator ran
out three seconds after you've

45:27.380 --> 45:31.059
'started the test and finding a pound
down the back of the sofa.

45:31.060 --> 45:35.059
'Then there's the bad ones
like being called to casualty
cos your youngest brother's allergic

45:35.620 --> 45:38.779
'to the trifle you just made him.
Or discovering that the rash

45:38.780 --> 45:42.779
'you'd finally thought had gone
has come back double and it's not

45:43.780 --> 45:47.179
'going away no matter how hard
you scratch it. And realising

45:47.180 --> 45:49.699
'that it's not a rash it's an
infection or worse a melanoma.

45:49.700 --> 45:53.699
'You can try ignore it, but someday
soon it's gonna jump up and bite ya.'

46:40.180 --> 46:41.339
G'night, Carl.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.539
Good night, Mum.

46:43.540 --> 46:44.659
G'night, Ian.

46:45.660 --> 46:46.659
Goodnight, Mum.

46:47.160 --> 46:51.159
G'night, Debbie.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.919
G'night, Phillip.

He can't HEAR you,

46:58.160 --> 47:00.279
G'night, Liam.

47:00.280 --> 47:05.279
