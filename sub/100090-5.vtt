WEBVTT

00:10.880 --> 00:12.795
What?
- Nothing.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.362
It's just that
we just started this shift

00:14.405 --> 00:15.624
and that's your second one.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.278
- What are you,
the coffee police now?

00:17.321 --> 00:18.409
- No, I'm just saying.

00:18.453 --> 00:19.628
All this caffeine
you're drinking

00:19.671 --> 00:20.759
is starting
to explain a lot, though.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.022
- What's the drill today?

00:22.065 --> 00:24.154
- Mm, Albany Park.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.590
Voight wants us
to knock on some doors,

00:25.634 --> 00:27.157
see if we can't
find any witnesses

00:27.201 --> 00:28.724
to that string
of home invasions.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.073
- Oh, right.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.205
One of my homies at patrol
told me about this.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.989
Uh, two guys masked up,
silver SUV.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.382
- Yeah, apparently
last night's hit

00:34.425 --> 00:35.557
was the third one this week.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.949
Crawford's nervous enough
about it,

00:36.993 --> 00:38.168
he wants Intelligence
to take over.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.735
So here we go.
- We can do that.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.302
- Mm, for the record,

00:41.345 --> 00:42.564
I don't have a problem
with coffee.

00:42.607 --> 00:43.913
I have problem without coffee.
- Copy that.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.307
- Let's go.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.873
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Sarge.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.051
Oh.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.313
- Whoa.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.792
- Okay.
- Ah, damn.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.577
Sorry about that, sir.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.275
- It's all right.
- There's coffee on my floor.

00:58.319 --> 01:01.887
You gonna clean that up?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.151
- What'd you do now?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.153
- Oh, it's all right.
Just had a little spill.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.502
- Nah, that ain't okay.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.112
He's the worst recruit
I've ever had.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.113
Get something
and clean this up.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.767
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

01:11.810 --> 01:13.377
- Y-yes, sir.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.683
- Ah, man,
it was just an accident.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.250
Think you're being
a little tough on the kid.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.642
- No, I ain't.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.296
Look, everybody has the right
to be dumb.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.907
That kid abuses that privilege,
know what I mean?

01:21.951 --> 01:24.301
Dumbass.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.738
- I remember the time.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.088
I'm telling you, dog,

01:28.131 --> 01:29.437
you definitely gotta
do it that way.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.744
It's stress--ah-ah-ah--
recovery, more stress.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.224
Make them tough, dog.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.791
- Doesn't make them tough,
though, really.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.532
- I mean, you know, the blues
don't need your approval.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.099
- I'm not saying
that they need my approval.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.101
I just don't like the bullying
of recruits.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.580
- See?
It's not bullying.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.321
But I understand
why you'd say that

01:44.365 --> 01:46.236
because you didn't have
to do the dance,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.585
so you don't like the moves.

01:47.629 --> 01:48.804
- Shot fired
in the 3000 block

01:48.847 --> 01:50.458
of South Wells Street,
Albany Park.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.024
- That's two blocks away.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.417
- 50-21 Ida, we're close by.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.246
We're gonna roll on that job
in plain clothes.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.682
- Help me, please!

01:57.726 --> 01:59.380
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I need help!

01:59.423 --> 02:00.642
- Stop, stop!
- Please!

02:00.685 --> 02:02.165
- Hands up.
- Stay right there.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.079
- Put your hands up!
- Stay right there.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.254
You stay right there.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.386
I got him,
I got him, I got him.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.257
Are you hit, huh?
You cut?

02:07.301 --> 02:09.129
- No, it's not mine!
It's my uncle's blood!

02:09.172 --> 02:10.434
He's been shot!

02:10.478 --> 02:12.132
- 50-21 David,
we need backup and an ambo

02:12.175 --> 02:13.611
to the 3000 block
of Wells Street.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.047
- Where's the shooter?
Is he still inside?

02:15.091 --> 02:16.136
- No, there were two guys!

02:16.179 --> 02:17.137
They robbed us
and shot my uncle!

02:17.180 --> 02:18.399
- Which way did they go?

02:18.442 --> 02:19.617
- They drove off
in a silver SUV

02:19.661 --> 02:21.358
with some patches on it
going that way!

02:21.402 --> 02:23.273
- Be advised:
silver SUV fled this location.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.796
Vehicle matches the description

02:24.840 --> 02:26.624
from the earlier
Albany Park crime broadcast.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.496
- Okay, where's your uncle?
- Inside our restaurant!

02:28.539 --> 02:29.975
- All right,
you stay right there.

02:30.019 --> 02:32.587
You get him, and I need you
to go around the back!

02:34.719 --> 02:35.938
- Ready?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.682
- Chicago PD!

02:45.948 --> 02:47.689
Clear.
- Clear.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.126
- Right, right, right.
- Okay.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.697
Body.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.874
- He's still breathing.
You clear the place.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.441
I got him, all right?
- I got it, I got it.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.007
- Sir, my name
is Officer Ruzek.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.313
We got an ambulance on the way.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.010
Hey, just keep breathing,
all right?

03:05.054 --> 03:06.142
Okay?

03:10.364 --> 03:11.756
- Is that--
is that who shot you?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.541
Say it again.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.326
- Ah, I don't understand...
- How we looking?

03:16.370 --> 03:17.806
- Kev, where is the ambo?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.373
- Squad, what's the ETA
on ambo?

03:19.416 --> 03:20.635
- Hey, listen,
do you speak English?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.854
Can you tell me in English?
Tell me the name.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.206
Come on, man, come on.
- C-candle...

03:28.643 --> 03:31.211
- Come on.
- C-candles...

03:34.997 --> 03:38.348
Damn it.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.225
- All right, we're running
point on this now,

03:45.268 --> 03:46.400
so what do we got?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.358
- Victim's name
is Nikolay Lukov.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.751
He had
just opened the place up.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.100
He was tallying receipts
in here

03:51.143 --> 03:52.884
when a couple guys came in
and they robbed him.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.364
- And like the previous
robberies in the area,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.061
the offenders fled
in a silver SUV

03:56.105 --> 03:57.454
with patches on the side.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.326
- Looks like they've gone
from hitting residences

03:59.369 --> 04:00.283
to hitting restaurants now.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.502
- How much they get?

04:01.545 --> 04:02.938
- Owner said
there was about 14 grand

04:02.981 --> 04:04.113
being prepared for deposit.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.854
- Any witnesses?

04:05.897 --> 04:07.725
- No other employees were here,
but we do have the owner's son.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.032
17 years old.
His name is Peter.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.816
He actually flagged us down.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.340
He said when he walked up,
the offenders fled

04:13.383 --> 04:14.732
and he did catch a glimpse
of one of them

04:14.776 --> 04:16.517
when they took
their ski mask off.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.127
Described him as male,
white, 30s.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.695
- All right, we bag his hands,
do a GSR test?

04:20.738 --> 04:22.392
- Yep, it came back clean.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.264
- All right, so let's canvass
the neighborhood for witnesses.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.569
Grab POD footage,

04:25.613 --> 04:27.136
and check
all suspicious persons

04:27.179 --> 04:28.877
in service clothes too.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.401
Maybe somebody saw
the offenders casing the place.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.403
- Copy that.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.579
Let's go.
- Yeah.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.668
- So can I take him home now?
- All right, listen--

04:37.712 --> 04:40.889
- What's up, boss?
- Oh, listen, this is Vasil.

04:40.932 --> 04:41.846
He owns the place.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.761
His--his brother
was the victim.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.198
- Oh, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.765
- Yeah.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.899
- Uh, I understand my brother
said something in Bulgarian.

04:50.942 --> 04:54.424
- Yeah, um, look,
I'm definitely butchering it,

04:54.468 --> 04:57.122
but it was
"koopi-she-something."

04:57.166 --> 04:59.081
- Sorry, I can't
understand that.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.344
- "Koopi-she-Chevy," maybe?
Something like that?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.911
When I asked him
to say it in English,

05:02.954 --> 05:05.261
I think I heard him whisper
the word "candles."

05:05.305 --> 05:07.785
- Was it...

05:09.265 --> 05:10.484
- Yeah,
that sounds about right.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.790
Yeah.
- Okay, what's that mean?

05:12.834 --> 05:15.793
- It means, uh,
"Buy yourself candles."

05:17.404 --> 05:19.057
- Okay, why do you think
he'd say that?

05:19.101 --> 05:20.189
- It's an old phrase.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.409
Um, loses something
in translation,

05:22.452 --> 05:24.802
but it's about forgiveness.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.108
- Huh.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.676
- I'll ask around,
see if anybody saw anything.

05:28.719 --> 05:31.156
- Well, that's all right.
My people are all over that.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.942
- Most of us around here
are from the Balkans,

05:33.985 --> 05:35.944
Sergeant Voight.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.642
If anyone in this neighborhood
saw anything,

05:38.686 --> 05:41.471
they wouldn't
share it with you.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.212
- Well, this isn't the Balkans.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.041
Chicago's a little different.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.956
- Is it?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.003
Let's go.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.834
- All right,
where we at on this?

05:56.878 --> 05:59.184
- We knocked on a few doors,
came up dry.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.708
- You would have thought that
somebody would have looked

06:00.751 --> 06:02.144
out the window or heard
the shots or something,

06:02.187 --> 06:03.363
but nobody saw anything.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.668
- Or if they did,
they ain't sharing.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.801
- All right, so street PODs?

06:06.844 --> 06:07.845
- Most of them
have been vandalized,

06:07.889 --> 06:09.151
made inoperable by the locals.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.979
- Patrol did say
this neighborhood is notorious

06:11.022 --> 06:11.893
for not cooperating.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.373
It's been like that for years.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.678
- All right, I'm gonna go back,
talk to this Vasil.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.027
Encourage him to work with us.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.552
Meanwhile, looks like
we're back at square one,

06:18.595 --> 06:20.467
so let's restart
at the beginning.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.816
- Hey, I just got a call

06:21.859 --> 06:23.992
from a CI
who's been asking around.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.473
He said he got word
that a silver SUV with patches

06:26.516 --> 06:28.126
was just dropped off
at an auto salvage yard

06:28.170 --> 06:29.824
on the South Side.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.043
- Okay, well, that might be our
offender's ride right there.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.611
- All right,
so you and Kev chase it.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.575
- Yo, my man.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.403
My man, you the owner?

06:43.446 --> 06:44.665
- Nah, fam.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.884
Let me, uh--
let me go get him for you.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.364
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah, you got it.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.367
- Yeah.
- Kev.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.716
You see this?

06:52.760 --> 06:55.110
Silver SUV,
Bondo patch on the side there.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.111
Could we be this lucky?

06:56.154 --> 06:57.155
- I think
we got a winner.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.635
We just gotta confirm it.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.463
Convenience is king, though.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.596
- Hey!

07:02.639 --> 07:04.206
Leave it alone.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.555
- Relax, man.
We're cops.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.078
Are you the owner?
- Yeah, I know who you are.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.123
Now get off my property.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.777
- What's all
this attitude about?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.866
- People like me being tired
of cops like you.

07:11.909 --> 07:15.217
- Listen, pal,
we're investigating a murder.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.914
We think this vehicle might
have been involved, all right?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.742
- If you ain't got a warrant,
you need to leave.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.744
- No, we don't need a warrant
to be here.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.442
- It's private property,
so, yeah, you do.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.574
- Um...

07:24.618 --> 07:26.054
my friend,
you sweating the small stuff

07:26.097 --> 07:27.621
that we don't really care
that much about.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.274
We just want to make sure
you got the paperwork for this.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.580
- I'm not your friend.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.016
Now leave
before I file a complaint.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.670
- You got quite the lip
on you, huh?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.933
- Chill, chill, chill, chill.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.066
You know
there's too much heat on you.

07:38.109 --> 07:41.025
We got him.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.592
- All right, then.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.681
It's not a problem.
We'll come back.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.770
I'm gonna see you again.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.947
- You'd better have a warrant
if you do.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.606
- Oh.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.739
What's this?
- Vasil asked for it.

07:58.782 --> 08:02.133
- Huh.
Well, thank you.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.701
My people talk to you yet?
- Not yet.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.182
I heard someone was
coming by in a few,

08:07.225 --> 08:08.575
but I don't know anything.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.491
- Well, they're gonna want
to talk to you anyway.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.623
- Okay.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.278
- Hmm.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.935
- She's a good-looking girl,
am I right?

08:20.978 --> 08:22.763
- Seems nice.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.635
My son--she's too old for him,

08:25.679 --> 08:29.073
but it doesn't stop him
from trying.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.771
- How's he doing?
Is he okay?

08:30.814 --> 08:33.121
- He was close to Nikolay,

08:33.164 --> 08:36.080
so that wound won't heal
for many years.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.131
To my brother's memory.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.665
What is that?
- Rakia.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.841
It's meant to be sipped.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.322
- That's good to know.
- Mm.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.239
- Let me ask you something...
- Yeah.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.025
- How are we supposed
to help you--

09:08.069 --> 09:10.201
or anybody
in this neighborhood--

09:10.245 --> 09:12.160
if no one's willing
to talk to us?

09:12.203 --> 09:14.641
- If someone saw something
that would help,

09:14.684 --> 09:16.120
I'd know about it.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.905
- No, if someone
sees something,

09:17.948 --> 09:19.863
they talk to us, not you.

09:19.907 --> 09:23.345
- I'm--I'm afraid that's not
how this neighborhood works.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.347
I told you
the first time we met:

09:25.390 --> 09:27.088
people here are guarded.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.873
They come from
an ex-Communist state.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.573
They don't trust the police
and their street cameras.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.576
They have had
their fill of both.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.708
- So let's change that.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.668
- Fine, then it starts with us.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.977
- Listen, Vasil,
this kind of thing

09:47.021 --> 09:50.241
doesn't happen
in a vacuum, okay?

09:50.285 --> 09:52.461
Somebody had to
eyeball this place

09:52.504 --> 09:54.245
before they robbed it.

09:54.289 --> 09:58.249
So if any of your employees
haven't been interviewed yet,

09:58.293 --> 10:00.643
we need to do that, not you.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
Okay?

10:05.126 --> 10:07.084
- Thanks.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.699
- All right, here's our guy.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.266
Jagoff's going mobile.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.922
- Uh, 50-21 David
to unit standing by,

10:18.966 --> 10:21.011
suspect vehicle is westbound
from the location.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.274
If you see a violation,
shake him.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.712
- 21-13, copy that.
We got you covered.

10:25.755 --> 10:29.454
- Let's go.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.935
Any luck?
- Yeah, had a .380.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.633
- Idiot tried to tuck it
underneath the seat

10:33.676 --> 10:34.721
when I walked up.

10:34.764 --> 10:35.939
- Ooh, all right.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.071
You just made up
for spilling my coffee.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.681
- I didn't really
do too much, sir.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.074
- Sure about that?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.989
'Cause you're the one
writing the paper.

10:42.032 --> 10:45.862
- Hey, enjoy that paperwork.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.126
Pay attention.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.824
- Yes, sir.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.565
- Hi.
- Oh, this is entrapment.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.524
- Well, you play stupid games,
you win stupid prizes.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.701
Here's the deal: you tell me
about the crushed SUV

10:58.745 --> 10:59.876
and I'm gonna forget
about the fact

10:59.920 --> 11:01.617
that you're chopping up
stolen rides.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.098
- No, you can forget it.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.709
I ain't telling you or your boy
nothing about my business.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.711
- "My boy"?
- You calling me a boy?

11:08.755 --> 11:11.235
- Yeah, consider me "not woke."

11:11.279 --> 11:14.325
- Yo, yo, yo, yo,
you watch your mouth.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.808
- You wanna play with me?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.724
You spit on me, huh?
Huh?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.770
What'd I tell you
about stupid games?

11:23.813 --> 11:24.727
- All right, okay!
- You wanna play with me?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.033
- Okay!

11:26.076 --> 11:27.425
- The next thing I hear
out of your mouth

11:27.469 --> 11:28.513
are some answers, yeah?

11:28.557 --> 11:30.385
- All right!
- All right.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.822
- Oh, damn.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.519
It--it was a white dude,
all right?

11:34.563 --> 11:36.086
I'd never seen him before.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.784
Didn't get a look
at his face.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.699
He gave me a grand
to crush the car.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.483
- Okay, any papers?

11:41.526 --> 11:44.529
- No, the plates and VIN
were already removed.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.096
And that's all I know, I swear!

11:46.140 --> 11:48.882
- How'd he leave?
- Uh, Uber or Lyft.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.884
He was using an app.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.366
- Was that so hard?
- Hey.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.720
- I'm sorry I put hands on him.
You see what he did?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.638
You know, he's got
a little split on his lip.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.380
- All good, no big deal.
So what now?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.426
- Well, he gave us
workable information,

12:11.469 --> 12:12.819
so I think we just kick him.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.211
- Might as well.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.823
- Nah, can't do that.
- You mean seriously?

12:16.866 --> 12:19.347
- Seriously.
Cruz saw how it went down.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.001
Gotta take him down,
book him for the gun.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.350
- Well, the split lip.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.438
I mean,
we're chasing this murder.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.353
I don't have time
to write up paper.

12:25.396 --> 12:27.355
- Okay, we'll say
the recruit did it.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.749
Got clumsy putting the offender
in the back seat.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.707
That what happened, Leavins?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.883
- Sir?
- That what happened?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.232
- Uh, yes, sir.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.756
- No, I'm just gonna
write up the paper.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.496
It's fine.
- No, we got this.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.715
Go ahead and do your case.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.238
- He doesn't know
what he's agreeing to.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.718
Kid, you sure
you're all right with this?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.590
- Bruh, he is.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.070
- I asked him, not you.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.072
- And I'm speaking for him.
We got this.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.857
- Listen, if I ask him
a question,

12:50.900 --> 12:53.120
you don't get to
answer it for him, all right?

13:08.048 --> 13:09.832
- What is your problem?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
- I don't have a problem,
all right?

13:11.529 --> 13:13.618
But I don't like
putting people in situations

13:13.662 --> 13:14.794
that they don't want to be in.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.796
- Okay, you know what?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.842
Screw it,
I'll write the damn paper.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.931
But you need to
mind your own business.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.454
How I treat
and train my recruit

13:23.498 --> 13:26.414
don't have anything
to do with you.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.854
Bruh, your guy.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.826
- Who's this guy?
- Gregory Barnes.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.175
He's 26, no criminal record.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.090
- We think this is the guy
that dropped off the SUV.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.353
It was his Uber account
that requested the pick-up

13:52.396 --> 13:53.615
at the auto salvage yard.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.660
- He got family,
work ties to Albany Park?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.575
- None that we can find.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.970
- Let's bring him in.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.497
- Hey, I need a word.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.722
- Yeah?

14:13.765 --> 14:16.029
- Guy with the bloody lip
is filing a CR.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.596
- What?
- Really, for that?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.425
- Yeah, his lawyer's
making a lot of noise.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.080
- All right, well,
did--did you file the report?

14:24.124 --> 14:26.691
- Yeah, and I made myself
the hero,

14:26.735 --> 14:29.694
which means I'm the only one
that lied.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.567
- All right, listen, man,
I didn't mean for that--

14:32.610 --> 14:34.308
- Well, it happened,

14:34.351 --> 14:36.266
and the recruit didn't
get dirty writing the report,

14:36.310 --> 14:40.314
which means he has no incentive
to back me up.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.098
- You think he'll roll?

14:42.142 --> 14:44.187
- He's a recruit, bruh.
What you think?

14:44.231 --> 14:45.667
Catches a beef,
gets caught lying,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.147
he's off the job for good.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.496
No recourse.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.672
- There a problem?

14:50.715 --> 14:51.847
- No, boss.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.544
- All right,
what's the hold up?

14:53.588 --> 14:56.199
Let's go.
- We're right behind you.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.074
- Look, I already asked Platt
to try to fix this.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.206
If she can't,
stick to what's in the report.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.512
It's our word
against the suspect

15:04.555 --> 15:07.036
and the recruit's.

15:11.606 --> 15:12.999
- So you seriously--
you don't think

15:13.042 --> 15:16.480
we should have our FOP reps
on standby just in case?

15:16.524 --> 15:19.309
- Mm-mm, I think we sit tight.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.658
Platt says she's got it.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.443
You know she runs it
with the blue and whites.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.837
- Sergeant, we're trying
to get patrol out here

15:25.881 --> 15:27.448
to cover the back,
but no one's acknowledging.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.841
- Yeah, well,
we don't have time to wait,

15:29.885 --> 15:32.627
so let's go in and get Barnes.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.064
- 50-21 Ida,
requesting a few units

15:35.108 --> 15:36.196
to our location.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.241
Non-emergency backup.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.291
Any units, come back.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.641
Is this a joke?
- That's our guy right there.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.209
- Yep, that's Barnes.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.646
Let's go.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.257
We got eyes on Barnes.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.606
Walking through the parking lot
of the building.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.565
We're gonna grab him up.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.481
- Gregory Barnes.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.962
Chicago PD.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.138
- He's running.
- We got a runner.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.188
Gun, gun, gun!
- Got it!

16:24.287 --> 16:27.334
- Hands behind your back.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.166
- Anyone hear sirens?

16:33.209 --> 16:35.559
'Cause I don't.

16:35.603 --> 16:39.259
- Come on.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.870
- Why'd patrol screw us
not rolling backup?

16:41.913 --> 16:45.917
- I don't know,
I might have caused an issue.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.877
- Do I need to get involved?
- No, I'm gonna handle it.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.444
- All right, good.
Do that.

16:50.487 --> 16:53.403
- Yeah.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.231
- Look, I don't know
what you're talking about,

16:55.275 --> 16:57.973
all right?
I didn't rob anybody.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.409
- Then why were you
carrying a gun?

16:59.453 --> 17:02.108
- Protection.
It's a tough neighborhood.

17:02.151 --> 17:05.285
- What about the SUV you dumped
at the auto salvage yard?

17:05.328 --> 17:06.373
- What about it?

17:06.416 --> 17:08.288
I mean, some guy
sold it to me cheap.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.898
It was a bucket
that was barely running.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.379
Worth more in scrap metal.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.641
- You see, that's funny,

17:13.684 --> 17:16.122
because the guy
at the salvage yard

17:16.165 --> 17:18.298
said it was you that paid him,
not the other way around.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.214
- Well, he's lying.

17:21.257 --> 17:24.695
- So what's the name of the guy
you sold it to?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.654
- I dunno, some black dude.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.743
Never seen him before or since.

17:28.786 --> 17:32.442
- Of course not.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.880
- Listen...

17:35.924 --> 17:38.535
They ain't just robberies
once a man dies.

17:38.579 --> 17:41.103
You understand?

17:41.147 --> 17:42.887
So if you weren't the shooter,

17:42.931 --> 17:45.412
now's your chance
to speak your piece.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.112
- No more questions.
I want a lawyer.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.160
Okay, anything else?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.031
- I mean, Barnes grew up
in Chicago,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.338
but since he's got
no criminal record,

17:58.381 --> 18:00.296
there's no associates
in our database.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.558
- The guy flies
under the radar.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.386
There's no social media
footprint either.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.867
- And the gun he tossed?
- Not reported stolen.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.129
And the ballistics
doesn't match,

18:07.173 --> 18:08.870
so unless we can tie him down
on the robbery

18:08.913 --> 18:10.393
in a more specific way,
we've got nothing

18:10.437 --> 18:11.873
but a misdemeanor
gun charge on him.

18:11.916 --> 18:15.355
- Huh.
- What about Vasil's son?

18:15.398 --> 18:17.661
I mean, he said
he saw one of them

18:17.705 --> 18:19.707
taking off his mask.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.057
- All right,
arrange for a lineup.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.629
- All right, take your time.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.760
If you need to see him
in profile,

18:29.804 --> 18:30.848
we can do that for you.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.895
Okay, Peter?

18:33.938 --> 18:36.985
- So it's one of them?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.161
- That's for him to tell us.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.250
Peter?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.863
- I'm just not sure.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.648
- Well, there's no rush.
We got plenty of time.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.737
Have a look.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.141
I don't...

19:02.184 --> 19:04.578
I just don't see the guy.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.362
I'm just not sure.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.756
- It's okay.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.975
You tried.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.202
- Boss, I found
something interesting

19:20.246 --> 19:22.726
when I was transcribing the
restaurant employee statements.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.164
Vasil's bartender,
Chelsea Roberts,

19:25.207 --> 19:27.340
shared the same street address
as Barnes,

19:27.383 --> 19:30.995
an apartment complex
over in Canaryville.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.475
- Well, that's huge.

19:32.519 --> 19:33.781
- It was years ago

19:33.824 --> 19:35.217
and they lived
in separate apartments, but--

19:35.261 --> 19:38.133
- But they knew each other.
- Huh?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.743
- Take a look
at Chelsea Roberts'

19:39.787 --> 19:41.136
social media account.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.399
This is her with Barnes
like three months ago.

19:43.443 --> 19:46.533
- Huh, call down to Trudy.
Put a hold on Barnes.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.578
Have Halstead and Upton
bring her in.

19:48.622 --> 19:52.408
- Hey, Sarge, we need to
put a hold on Barnes.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.497
How long ago?

19:54.541 --> 19:56.978
All right, thank you.
He bonded out an hour ago.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.762
- All right,
you and Kev go grab him.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.374
Nice work, Rojas.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.246
- Yeah, this is Kev.
Tell Voight we came up dry.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.640
Barnes isn't at home,
but we'll track him down.

20:06.683 --> 20:07.858
All right.

20:07.902 --> 20:10.034
- Landlord said
Barnes stopped by,

20:10.078 --> 20:12.167
grabbed a few things,
and then he took off.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.474
- Well, that man ain't stupid.
He know we on his ass.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.259
- Yeah, she also said
she's looking out her window,

20:17.303 --> 20:19.174
she sees a suspicious white guy

20:19.218 --> 20:22.482
sitting in his car
watching Barnes.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.571
- Could be
the partner in crime.

20:24.614 --> 20:25.963
- Yeah, one would think,

20:26.007 --> 20:27.748
except Barnes didn't seem
to know he was there.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.837
Barnes takes off, car follows.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.056
- Hmm.

20:37.148 --> 20:40.282
- Why am I here?
What's going on?

20:40.326 --> 20:43.198
- Why don't you tell us
about Gregory Barnes?

20:47.594 --> 20:48.682
- Barnes?

20:48.725 --> 20:52.120
I--it doesn't sound familiar.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.340
- Doesn't sound familiar?

20:54.383 --> 20:57.125
Why are you draped all over him
in that picture?

20:58.387 --> 21:00.215
Somebody had to tell Barnes
and his partner

21:00.259 --> 21:02.086
who the Albany Park targets
would be, Chelsea.

21:02.130 --> 21:05.307
- And a bartender
in a place like that

21:05.351 --> 21:08.092
probably heard a lot of locals
bragging about stuff.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.616
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.095
- A man has died, Chelsea.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.620
Are you sure you want to
keep playing this game with us?

21:19.016 --> 21:21.062
I didn't know
anyone would be killed.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.760
- But they were.
- I...

21:27.590 --> 21:30.245
I shouldn't have told him
about the--the money

21:30.289 --> 21:32.029
that the owner kept
at the restaurant,

21:32.073 --> 21:34.118
but Peter kept bragging

21:34.162 --> 21:36.904
about how well
the place was doing and I...

21:39.907 --> 21:42.083
And I was scared...

21:42.126 --> 21:44.912
for the future.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.088
- Yours or his?

21:49.177 --> 21:51.614
- The baby's.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.401
- Chelsea, you're pregnant?

21:57.490 --> 22:00.580
Eight weeks.

22:00.623 --> 22:03.626
- The best thing you can do
for that child and for yourself

22:03.670 --> 22:05.280
is just tell us everything.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.152
- I--I want to, but I think

22:08.196 --> 22:09.589
I should probably
just get a lawyer.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.112
- Sure, you can do that.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.592
We can't help you
after that, though,

22:12.635 --> 22:15.899
so it's up to you.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.988
- I--I can't go to jail.

22:18.032 --> 22:20.208
- You're gonna go
to jail, Chelsea,

22:20.251 --> 22:22.123
but what you say to us now
will make a big difference

22:22.166 --> 22:24.560
as to how much time
you're gonna spend there.

22:24.604 --> 22:28.477
- When's the last time
you saw Barnes, Chelsea?

23:01.031 --> 23:03.991
- Body.
- Clear.

23:04.034 --> 23:06.080
- Clear.
- Clear!

23:25.012 --> 23:26.274
- No sign of forced entry,

23:26.317 --> 23:27.580
so the shooter probably knocked
on the door.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.799
- Smart move hitting him here.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.671
There's usually no cameras
in a place like this.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.194
- Yeah, but why kill him?

23:33.237 --> 23:35.675
- Partner probably got nervous
after the arrest.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.633
- Waits outside
Barnes' apartment,

23:37.677 --> 23:40.767
follows him to a seedy motel,
pops him, ties off the caper.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.682
- All right, well,
let's get the techs in here.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.248
Hopefully they can
find some prints

23:44.292 --> 23:46.599
and we can untie this thing.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.561
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Oh, for you, Trudy?

23:52.605 --> 23:54.737
I think I got ten.
What's up?

23:54.781 --> 23:57.827
- Uh, you picked up a complaint
on a training officer

23:57.871 --> 24:00.656
by the name of Werner.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.227
- Yeah, I did.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.621
I haven't had a chance
to give the file a read yet.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.058
What's your interest?
- He's one of mine.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.320
Good police.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.322
Intelligence walled off
the arrest to him.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.846
If you dig too deep,
others are in the line of fire.

24:16.890 --> 24:20.110
It'll get messy.
- These things always do.

24:20.154 --> 24:23.505
- So can we police our own?
Maybe make this go away?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.638
- "Go away"?

24:25.681 --> 24:28.249
No, not if there's
any substance to it.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.598
This guy's lawyer,

24:29.642 --> 24:32.296
he's gonna want
to get his pound of flesh.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.256
- Well...

24:36.953 --> 24:39.434
We've got history, you and I.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.615
Best I can offer--

24:46.659 --> 24:49.444
and I'm only floating this
because of that--

24:49.488 --> 24:52.665
low-ball plea.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.449
- Let me know
what that would consist of.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.669
I'll see what I can do.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.285
- All right, what do we got?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.808
- The techs couldn't find
any comparable prints

25:05.852 --> 25:07.157
in the motel room.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.681
- Ballistics confirmed
that it's a 9-millimeter,

25:08.724 --> 25:10.204
but it doesn't match
any in the system.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.510
- So nothing.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.946
- I might have something.
- Okay.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.861
- I took a deep dive
into Barnes' cell records.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.819
Figured if he's got
a new friend like Chelsea said,

25:16.863 --> 25:18.299
that number would have
just started popping out

25:18.342 --> 25:19.343
on his cell phone.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.520
- You get a name?
- Yes.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.391
Jack Cranston.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.654
Recently paroled from
Stateville for armed robbery.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.787
Exchanged gunfire with cops
last time they arrested him.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.397
- All right, let's get
his address

25:29.440 --> 25:30.833
from his parole officer.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.662
I want a confirmed visual
before we grab him.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.977
- You got anything?

25:44.020 --> 25:46.762
- Nah, negative.
No sign of him yet.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.374
Hey, we've lost the eye.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.768
There's a delivery truck that
just landed and blocked us.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.509
- Does it look like
he's gonna stick around?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.512
- Nah, just dropping off.
His hazards are on.

26:03.605 --> 26:06.652
- Is that Cranston?

26:06.695 --> 26:09.437
- I--I can't tell.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.178
- Let us know
if you want us to do a pass.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.875
- No, that'll take too long.
I'm just gonna do a walk by.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.834
- All right,
Hailey's stepping out on foot.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.358
She's gonna get a visual.

26:36.812 --> 26:39.336
- It's Cranston.
We should move on him.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.998
- Get down, get down!

26:50.347 --> 26:52.001
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
- 10-1, 10-1!

26:52.045 --> 26:53.568
Shots fired at the police!
- Get out of the car.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.700
Out of the car.

26:54.743 --> 26:55.875
Get around back,
get around back!

26:55.918 --> 26:57.659
- Get down!
- Get down, get down!

26:57.703 --> 26:59.661
Stay down!
- Stay down, stay down!

26:59.705 --> 27:02.185
- Moving!

27:02.229 --> 27:03.970
- Down!

27:04.013 --> 27:06.842
Stay down, stay down!

27:09.105 --> 27:10.454
- Moving!
Back, back, back!

27:10.498 --> 27:12.065
- Cover me, cover me!

27:12.108 --> 27:14.807
- I got you, I got you.
- CPD, I got you, I got you.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.635
- Moving!

27:17.984 --> 27:19.855
Come on, come on.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.610
- Where the hell's patrol?

27:35.654 --> 27:38.744
We need backup!
We're still being fired on!

27:38.787 --> 27:40.615
- I'm moving!
I'm moving!

27:46.273 --> 27:47.753
Cranston!

27:47.796 --> 27:49.232
Cranston, Chicago PD!

27:49.276 --> 27:50.886
Come out with your hands up!
You're done!

27:50.930 --> 27:52.758
- Drop your weapon
and step out!

27:52.801 --> 27:54.716
- Cranston!

27:54.760 --> 27:56.762
Cranston!

28:06.946 --> 28:09.296
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

28:18.348 --> 28:21.569
- Bro, what you got?
No containment?

28:21.612 --> 28:23.571
- He's gone.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.497
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.194
We've done
a thorough grid search.

28:38.238 --> 28:41.763
- How'd he break containment?
- There was none.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.504
- Adam.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.945
You do realize that if patrol
had actually rolled on this,

28:49.989 --> 28:51.860
we would have
the son of a bitch right now?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.819
- I know.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.951
- Look, whatever this is
between you and them,

28:55.995 --> 28:59.172
just put it to bed,
and do it fast.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.565
- Yes, sir.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.353
- Werner.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.100
- What's up, Sarge?
- We need to end this crap.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.842
- Okay, but I never told anyone
not to roll

29:16.885 --> 29:18.191
when Intelligence
needed backup.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.540
- You didn't have to.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.891
They did it
out of respect for you.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.067
I talked to IAD.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.721
Plead to unreported force

29:26.765 --> 29:28.854
and you'll only get
a three-day suspension.

29:28.897 --> 29:31.334
- If I do that, I lose
my training officer status.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.950
Better I take the chance the
recruit sticks to the report.

29:37.993 --> 29:41.649
- And if he doesn't?
Werner, he's a recruit.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.303
They're gonna press him hard,
and guess what?

29:43.346 --> 29:46.306
He probably can't stand you,
so why would he be willing

29:46.349 --> 29:48.047
to put his career
on the line for this?

29:48.090 --> 29:51.180
- Look, I shouldn't be
in this position.

29:51.224 --> 29:54.705
- But you are.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.099
- What's this?
- It's from Ruzek.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.448
There's a week's pay in there.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.755
It is more than enough
to cover the three days,

30:00.799 --> 30:03.802
and after you do 'em,
you contest the judgment.

30:03.845 --> 30:07.544
By then, eye will be off this
and IAD will clear it.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.677
Listen to me, Werner:

30:09.720 --> 30:11.157
it's gonna take a bit,

30:11.200 --> 30:14.334
but I can make you whole
on this if you let me.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.075
- I will, and thanks.

30:16.118 --> 30:19.948
But this Ruzek guy
showed me no respect.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.776
Thinks he's a big shot
'cause he works upstairs.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.170
We're both blue.
Why's he get a pass?

30:26.172 --> 30:28.827
- Okay, what do you need?

30:32.308 --> 30:34.180
- I gotta go.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.753
- Vasil, thank you.
- Is there news?

30:42.797 --> 30:45.104
- We realize
this is a bad time,

30:45.147 --> 30:47.889
but we'd like to show
some photos to Peter, please.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.717
- Look, we're trying
to build a case

30:49.760 --> 30:51.937
against the second member
of the robbery crew.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.287
An ID from Peter
would solidify it.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.419
- It's important.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.465
- Hey, Peter.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.079
Uh, they want to
show you some pictures.

31:04.123 --> 31:06.473
- All right, why don't you
just take a look?

31:06.516 --> 31:10.172
We think, uh, one of these guys
might be the second robber.

31:15.525 --> 31:18.006
Any of them look like the guy
that pulled up the ski mask?

31:19.616 --> 31:21.880
- I'm not sure.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.360
- Just take your time.
Why don't you look again?

31:27.624 --> 31:29.235
- Don't recognize them.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.150
Sorry.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.804
- Go check on your aunt.
- Thank you.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.806
- Anything else?
- No.

31:35.850 --> 31:38.592
I know how hard this is, but...

31:38.635 --> 31:40.855
is he okay?

31:40.899 --> 31:43.727
- He thinks it's his fault
my brother's dead,

31:43.771 --> 31:45.947
that his mouth
brought us this misfortune.

31:45.991 --> 31:49.255
- Hmm.
- So the answer's no.

31:49.298 --> 31:50.996
He's not okay.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.346
None of us are.

31:57.785 --> 32:01.006
- Sarge, take a look at this.
- What do you got?

32:01.049 --> 32:02.572
- I pulled the POD footage
to find out

32:02.616 --> 32:04.661
how in the hell
Cranston broke containment.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.013
- You zoom in on the plate?
- I did.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.971
It's registered to a woman
named Gina Morales.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.712
- She and the car
resurface yet?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.627
- No, and the GPS is disabled.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.020
- So he's still got her.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.283
- Think so.
I put out a BOLO.

32:17.326 --> 32:19.024
- Yeah, and check
her home address.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.069
See if someone has her number.
We can ping and track her cell.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.463
- Yeah, good.

32:24.246 --> 32:27.554
- You ever had to
do a notification like this?

32:27.597 --> 32:28.990
- It's never easy
to tell somebody,

32:29.034 --> 32:31.601
"Hey, your loved one's
been kidnapped."

32:33.038 --> 32:35.344
- Maybe we won't have to.
Isn't that her car?

32:35.388 --> 32:36.911
- It is.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.739
- All right,
so either he let her go

32:38.782 --> 32:39.870
and she was too scared
to report it, or--

32:39.914 --> 32:40.959
- Cranston's in the house.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.570
Take the back, I got the front.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.404
It's him!
Let's go!

32:55.190 --> 32:58.237
- Don't move!
Drop the weapon!

32:58.280 --> 33:00.717
Drop the weapon!

33:04.069 --> 33:05.809
- Make me do it.

33:07.028 --> 33:10.640
Smart move.
Walk down the stairs.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.208
Mm-hmm.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.428
On your knees.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.995
On your knees!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.561
Go.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.623
- Gina.

33:36.666 --> 33:39.539
- This is Officer Rojas
with Chicago PD.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.802
- Oh, my God.
- You're safe.

33:41.845 --> 33:45.153
- Oh, my God, thank you.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.941
- Armed robbery,
kidnapping, and murder.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.639
That's a felony trifecta.
- "Murder"?

33:52.682 --> 33:54.510
- Sit down.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.077
- Look, I don't know
what he told you,

33:56.121 --> 33:58.471
but it was Barnes
that shot that old man, not me.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.300
- Barnes? Barnes...
- Sit down!

34:01.343 --> 34:03.998
- Look, you don't believe it,
put me in a cell with him.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.173
I'll wear a wire.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.131
You can hear it
with your own ears.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.175
- The hell are you talking--

34:07.219 --> 34:08.350
you want to be in a cell
with Barnes?

34:08.394 --> 34:10.004
- Yeah, he's an idiot.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.571
Uh, he panicked.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.834
Gun went off when he was trying
to push the old man away.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.270
I mean, Christ,
I had to tell him

34:15.314 --> 34:16.924
to get rid of the gun
after he'd used it!

34:16.967 --> 34:19.666
He was gonna hold onto
the damn thing.

34:19.709 --> 34:20.754
Oh, come on!

34:20.797 --> 34:22.669
Don't--don't play me
for stupid!

34:22.712 --> 34:25.541
I know you picked him up
yesterday.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.196
- You're trying to tell me
it wasn't you followed Barnes

34:28.240 --> 34:30.677
from the motel
after he made bail?

34:30.720 --> 34:33.680
- What are you talking about?

34:33.723 --> 34:35.769
- Look, either this guy
is a hell of an actor

34:35.812 --> 34:38.163
or he really doesn't know
Barnes is dead.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.338
- Maybe he doesn't.

34:39.381 --> 34:40.817
His cell phone GPS
puts him at home

34:40.861 --> 34:43.037
during the time
of Barnes' murder.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.430
- You're sure about that?

34:44.473 --> 34:47.998
- Yeah, she's right.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.088
- You said the landlord saw
a guy stalking Barnes

34:50.131 --> 34:51.437
right after he bailed out.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.526
- Yeah, but we couldn't confirm
with the footage

34:53.569 --> 34:55.789
from the street PODs
outside Barnes' apartment.

34:55.832 --> 34:58.705
There was no sign of Cranston
or his car.

35:00.576 --> 35:03.797
- Well, maybe we're not
looking for Cranston.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.626
Let's pull all POD footage
from in and around that motel.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.427
I let myself in.

35:31.651 --> 35:34.349
- Dad, is everything okay?

35:34.393 --> 35:36.438
- Go upstairs.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.921
I said go upstairs.

35:53.281 --> 35:56.110
- What's this about?

35:59.287 --> 36:02.029
Your brother's last words.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.162
"Buy yourself candles," right?

36:05.989 --> 36:08.296
See, I think he meant it
as a curse.

36:08.340 --> 36:11.169
Like, candles
for your funeral.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.434
He wasn't asking
for forgiveness.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.262
It was a plea
for vengeance, right?

36:17.305 --> 36:18.654
- He was dying.

36:18.698 --> 36:21.048
What type of man
wouldn't want vengeance?

36:27.620 --> 36:30.536
- I just found that
under Peter's mattress.

36:35.454 --> 36:38.239
It's a 9-millimeter.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.502
Same caliber used
to kill Barnes.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.943
What's the chance
the ballistics will match?

36:48.728 --> 36:51.557
- It's mine.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.951
- Then why would you put it
under Peter's mattress?

36:56.214 --> 36:59.913
- You want a confession,
I'll give you one.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.484
It's my gun.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.487
I'm the one
who killed that man.

37:08.530 --> 37:12.317
- But you didn't.
Your son did.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.710
Peter did recognize Barnes
in that lineup.

37:14.754 --> 37:18.453
He just said he didn't
because he wanted revenge,

37:18.497 --> 37:21.282
to earn back your respect.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.502
- I've already told you,

37:23.545 --> 37:25.765
I'm the one who did it,

37:25.808 --> 37:28.420
and you got no evidence
my son is involved.

37:30.378 --> 37:33.947
- Vasil, I got POD footage
of Peter...

37:33.990 --> 37:36.123
sitting in his car...

37:38.212 --> 37:41.433
A block from the motel
where Barnes was murdered.

37:50.006 --> 37:53.053
A man's dead, Vasil.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.837
I can't just ignore that.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.448
- Why?

37:58.624 --> 38:00.974
Is Chicago worse because of it?

38:03.368 --> 38:06.066
Please...

38:06.109 --> 38:09.678
this is on me.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.550
Even though I didn't
pull the trigger,

38:11.593 --> 38:14.248
I'm the one responsible.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.260
- Come on.

38:33.398 --> 38:36.575
- Hey, Hank?
Can I have a sidebar?

38:36.618 --> 38:39.926
- Give me a minute, Jay.
I'll catch up.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.319
What do you got?

38:41.362 --> 38:44.583
- Um, I couldn't completely
resolve the Ruzek issue.

38:44.626 --> 38:48.630
Werner has an ask that
is way beyond my paygrade.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.546
- Tell me.

38:56.421 --> 39:00.294
"I was born for the storm
and the calm does not suit me."

39:02.165 --> 39:03.993
You ever hear that saying?

39:04.037 --> 39:06.039
- No.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.607
- Well, is that
what this is, Adam?

39:08.650 --> 39:10.565
You just can't take the calm?

39:12.437 --> 39:15.440
- I don't know, boss.
I'm sorry.

39:15.483 --> 39:18.094
Thought I could handle it.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.140
- But you didn't.

39:21.968 --> 39:25.667
This thing between you
and patrol...

39:25.711 --> 39:26.886
it has got to end.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.018
- I know, I want it to.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.673
I mean, I'll do anything.
- Yeah?

39:31.717 --> 39:34.328
Well, that's good to know.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.463
Follow me.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.468
- Oh, God.

39:53.869 --> 39:56.481
You know,
Werner's losing his badge

39:56.524 --> 39:57.699
for three days over this.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.092
- I know, I know.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.268
I gave him money to try
and take the sting off that.

40:01.311 --> 40:04.140
- Yeah, well, he wants more
than your money.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.242
- Are you serious?

40:22.855 --> 40:25.379
- It's about respect.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.045
He's a big guy, Sarge.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.134
- Yeah.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.312
- You're not asking me
to lose this, are you?

40:45.355 --> 40:47.401
- No.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.100
Never.
