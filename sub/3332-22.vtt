00:00.001 --> 00:02.768
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Hey, remember way back</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:04.370
<i>When you first met</i>
<i>jane gloriana villanueva,</i>

00:04.372 --> 00:07.306
<i>Daughter of xiomara,</i>
<i>granddaughter of alba?</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:10.109
<i>Back then, jane was engaged</i>
<i>to detective michael cordero,</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:12.478
<i>And across town,</i>
<i>rafael was married to petra.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.146
<i>But then-- zoinks!</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:15.381
<i>Jane was accidentally</i>
<i>inseminated</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:17.049
<i>With rafael's sperm.</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:18.517
<i>So jane broke up with michael</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:21.220
And rafael broke up with petra.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.322
<i>And guess what?</i>
<i>They fell in love.</i>

00:23.324 --> 00:25.190
<i>Until rafael started spiraling</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:26.792
<i>And broke up with jane--</i>

00:26.794 --> 00:28.460
<i>Which, for the record,</i>
<i>he really regrets.</i>

00:28.462 --> 00:30.229
<i>Also full of regrets: Petra.</i>

00:30.231 --> 00:32.464
<i>See, she owns</i>
<i>part of rafael's hotel,</i>

00:32.466 --> 00:34.533
<i>But she doesn't have the one</i>
<i>thing she really wants:</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:36.301
<i>Rafael.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:39.271
<i>I know! Straight out</i>
<i>of a telenovela, right?</i>

00:39.273 --> 00:42.141
<i>Well, imagine this:</i>
<i>Jane realized her father</i>

00:42.143 --> 00:45.210
<i>Was her favorite telenovela</i>
<i>star, rogelio de la vega.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.246
<i>And he came back</i>
<i>into her life...</i>

00:47.248 --> 00:49.481
<i>With a vengeance.</i>

00:49.483 --> 00:51.216
<i>And that's enough recapping.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.185
<i>There's a baby to be born,</i>

00:53.187 --> 00:55.587
<i>So let's get popping.</i>

00:55.589 --> 00:58.557
<i>Here's what you need to know</i>
<i>about villanueva babies...</i>

00:58.559 --> 01:01.193
(woman panting)
doctor:
<i>Come on. Push, xiomara.</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:03.262
Latin lover narrator:
<i>They come late,</i>
<i>they come quick,</i>

01:03.264 --> 01:05.130
<i>And they come girl.</i>

01:05.132 --> 01:06.832
(xiomara groaning)
doctor:
<i>Come on.</i>

01:06.834 --> 01:10.269
Ah! Ah!

01:10.271 --> 01:11.603
Push...

01:11.605 --> 01:13.839
(groans, whimpers)

01:13.841 --> 01:15.774
I need you to push again,
xiomara.
I can't.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.077
Mommy, I'm tired.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.793
(screams)

01:36.362 --> 01:38.797
(baby crying)

01:38.799 --> 01:40.399
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And just like that,</i>

01:40.401 --> 01:43.735
<i>Another villanueva came</i>
<i>into the world.</i>

01:43.737 --> 01:45.404
She's perfect.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.877
I have a name.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.779
Jane.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.783
Jane gloriana villanueva.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.685
Jane:
<i>Mom, relax.</i>

01:59.687 --> 02:01.320
The baby's not due
for three weeks.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.654
I'm still only one
centimeter dilated,

02:02.656 --> 02:03.722
And there's no movement,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.457
There's no change...

02:05.459 --> 02:06.725
But I'll never forgive myself
if I miss it --

02:06.727 --> 02:08.160
You won't.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.561
But if you miss
his vegas show,

02:09.563 --> 02:10.796
Rogelio will
never forgive you.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.431
You're his opening act!

02:12.433 --> 02:15.501
And you guys just
became friends again.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.402
I know, I know.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.138
Plus, you know, this is
really good for your career.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.906
And it's only three days.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.908
Two and a half.
And if anything happens...
Of course,

02:22.910 --> 02:24.843
I'll call and you'll be
on the next flight out.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.578
Okay.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.747
(gasps softly)

02:28.749 --> 02:29.915
Jane?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.283
Ah...

02:31.285 --> 02:32.784
Ah...
A contraction?

02:32.786 --> 02:33.819
Ow, ow! Ow.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.188
Oh, my god.
Ow...

02:36.190 --> 02:37.756
You're going into labor.
Oh, my god,

02:37.758 --> 02:38.790
Oh, my god!

02:38.792 --> 02:40.826
(laughing)

02:40.828 --> 02:43.595
Oh...

02:43.597 --> 02:44.830
(laughing):
I'm sorry...

02:44.832 --> 02:47.299
I hate you.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.434
(laughing):
I'm sorry.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.270
It was just so easy.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.739
(laughing)

03:00.713 --> 03:02.414
Xiomara:
So how was it for you and rafael

03:02.416 --> 03:03.682
At the doctor's appointment?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.185
Pretty good,
actually.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.353
You know, I'm glad we
broke up when we did.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.755
I mean,
after the baby

03:09.757 --> 03:11.190
It would have been
so much messier.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.591
Which I told him,
by the way.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.859
Rafael:
<i>It's not that easy, luisa.</i>

03:13.861 --> 03:16.261
Jane keeps talking
about how glad she is

03:16.263 --> 03:17.729
That I broke up
with her when I did.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.731
Because you said
that you didn't love her.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.867
She needs to know
that's not true.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.203
Does she? Is that fair?

03:24.205 --> 03:25.837
I mean, she's moved on.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.706
Jane?
What are you thinking?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.475
Nothing.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.211
Just...

03:32.213 --> 03:33.979
You know, there was a moment

03:33.981 --> 03:35.614
At the doctor's office today.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.883
Woman:
That, there, looks like hair.

03:37.885 --> 03:38.917
What?
You can see hair?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.819
Sometimes.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.487
I was bald.
That must come from your side.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.755
I did have a lot of hair.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.957
Wait, like a weird amount?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.225
No, not a weird...
Come on, if you had

03:46.227 --> 03:47.526
A weird amount, just admit it.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.930
Okay, it was kind of a lot.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.665
(giggles)

03:53.667 --> 03:54.933
Jane:
<i>For a minute,</i>

03:54.935 --> 03:56.835
It felt like
nothing had changed.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.404
It was like before
I screwed everything up.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.006
What happened next?

04:01.008 --> 04:03.242
Well, I wanted
to take a picture...

04:03.244 --> 04:04.876
Fine, one.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.579
You'll thank me.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.414
(ringing)

04:12.418 --> 04:14.886
<i>The timing could not</i>
<i>have been worse.</i>

04:14.888 --> 04:17.422
The timing was perfect,
actually.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.857
A reminder: We're
better off apart.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.926
You know, there's too much
crazy drama in his life.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.527
And petra is evil.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.695
Of course
I don't blame jane

04:23.697 --> 04:24.863
For not wanting
to be around her.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.398
I mean, I don't even
want to be around her.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.899
Do you even know
all the stuff she's done

04:27.901 --> 04:30.269
Since we broke up?
I'm not sure.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.837
I know about the custody play,

04:31.839 --> 04:33.338
The false abuse allegations,

04:33.340 --> 04:34.873
The covering for...
The point is,

04:34.875 --> 04:37.843
I am finally seeing the light
at the end of the tunnel.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.779
And with the influx of cash
from the maracay sale...

04:47.887 --> 04:50.055
...I can actually buy petra out.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.523
If she'll sell.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.792
I mean, yeah,
she wants to be around you

04:53.794 --> 04:55.460
And she clearly wants you back.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.296
And I plan on using that.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.731
Trust me,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.500
I will get her to sell.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.934
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, I've hinted at</i>

05:02.936 --> 05:04.936
<i>A playboy past, have I not?</i>

05:04.938 --> 05:07.472
<i>Our rafael had quite the game.</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:09.074
Okay, well,
just be careful.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.510
That woman is the devil
in a pretty package.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.980
Rogelio: <i>It is called</i>
<i>the vegas star package.</i>

05:14.982 --> 05:17.082
Three complimentary
buffet breakfasts

05:17.084 --> 05:18.850
And unlimited spa time.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.519
I already signed myself up

05:20.521 --> 05:23.989
For an energizing,
40-minute body buff.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.457
Sounds very
impressive.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.958
As impressive as the city
of las vegas itself.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.493
It's a cultural mecca.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.995
My driver's waiting.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.463
Where is your mother?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.532
Xiomara!
Hurry up, xiomara!

05:33.534 --> 05:34.866
(phone whooshes)

05:50.550 --> 05:51.817
Xiomara:
Who are you texting?

05:51.819 --> 05:54.119
No one. Just michael.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.856
It's nothing.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.391
I actually just cancelled
dinner with him.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.093
So you were
having dinner?

06:01.095 --> 06:02.728
As friends, mom.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.962
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which, for the record,</i>

06:03.964 --> 06:06.131
<i>She tried to believe was true.</i>

06:06.133 --> 06:07.799
Don't you guys have
a plane to catch?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.568
Oh, yes.
Yes, we do.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.070
Now, if anything
happens with the baby...

06:12.072 --> 06:13.939
Yes, any change, uh,

06:13.941 --> 06:15.574
One centimeter
more dilated,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.075
Or a half a centimeter
more dilated...

06:17.077 --> 06:18.944
I will call.
I promise.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.045
Don't worry.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.714
Break a leg.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.519
Oy! Oh... Dad.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.054
Okay.
Baby.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.090
Petra:
So I think we should gut
the recovery suites.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.726
Just... Turn them into
something else entirely.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.430
Rafael?

06:39.766 --> 06:41.099
Uh...

06:41.101 --> 06:42.934
Sorry.
Uh, could you...

06:42.936 --> 06:44.636
Could you just
repeat the last part?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.605
Latin lover narrator:
I told you he was good at this.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.973
Focus.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.508
Okay?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.977
Look, we need to change
the recovery suites.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.678
Because right now, they're...

06:53.680 --> 06:55.147
Associated with rose.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.616
I just wanted to drop off
some ideas for the upgrade

06:57.618 --> 06:59.451
To the recovery spa.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.754
(yells)

07:05.425 --> 07:07.492
(whistling)

07:12.565 --> 07:14.433
I agree.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.902
Let's gut them.
Great.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.503
And let's also get dinner.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.207
What?
Come on, petra.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.476
I mean, I can't be
the only one that's feeling...

07:24.478 --> 07:26.111
(knocking)

07:26.113 --> 07:28.447
Not now, scott.
Scott:
Sorry, uh...

07:28.449 --> 07:29.881
It's miami-dade memorial.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.716
Patient representative
department again.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.719
What? Is the
cancer back?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.221
Did you get another scan?
Are you okay?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.622
No, I am fine, I haven't
been there in months.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.157
It's probably just a survey,

07:39.159 --> 07:40.225
Or some billing.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.160
Maybe you can take care of it.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.196
No, I-I tried, but it's...
Now, scott.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.601
So... Um...

07:49.603 --> 07:53.872
We were talking about
dinner, I think.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.676
What about trivolo's?

07:59.745 --> 08:02.013
Yeah.
Trivolo's sounds nice.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.248
Latin lover narrator
<i>hmm.</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:05.116
<i>Never heard of trivolo's.</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:09.020
<i>But it seems to mean something</i>
<i>to petra.</i>

08:09.022 --> 08:10.121
(crickets chirping)

08:10.123 --> 08:11.723
Michael:
I know you can't go out,

08:11.725 --> 08:13.225
But you still
gotta eat, right?

08:13.227 --> 08:15.193
Cheeseburgers and
half and half fries

08:15.195 --> 08:16.261
From river green.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.829
Oh, my god, yes.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.264
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And it sounds like that</i>

08:19.266 --> 08:21.166
<i>Means something to jane.</i>

08:22.935 --> 08:24.202
Where is everyone?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.504
My mom left for vegas

08:25.506 --> 08:27.172
And my grandma's
at physical therapy.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.140
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ooh, just the two of them.</i>

08:29.142 --> 08:30.575
Got it.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.211
Uh, sit,
I'll get the plates.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.846
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Aw, look at that.</i>

08:34.848 --> 08:37.215
<i>He knows where everything is.</i>

08:37.217 --> 08:38.617
So how's the grad school
application coming?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.218
Not so good.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.220
The school
e-mailed me back

08:42.222 --> 08:45.524
And they won't accept it
because I missed the deadline.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.225
By two days.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.727
You gotta be kidding me.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.262
Do you want to see the e-mail?

08:50.264 --> 08:51.263
No, I'm talking
about giving up.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.265
What happened
to the jane

08:53.267 --> 08:55.033
Who got a "b"
on a four-page paper,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.268
Then wrote a six-page paper

08:56.270 --> 08:58.069
Explaining why
she deserved an "a"?

08:58.071 --> 08:59.905
(laughs)
come on.

08:59.907 --> 09:00.972
Write the admissions
person back.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.681
So?

09:09.683 --> 09:10.949
What do you think?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.851
Maybe...

09:12.853 --> 09:14.920
One less exclamation point.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.557
Perfect.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.792
I would... I would hire you
based on this.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.093
Hit send.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.196
Ah...
Jane?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.298
Oh, my stomach...

09:26.300 --> 09:29.134
Ooh...
Oh. Um...

09:29.136 --> 09:30.569
Ooh... Ah...
Oh. Oh!

09:30.571 --> 09:31.836
Wait. What,
what's going on?

09:31.838 --> 09:33.605
Wow.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.809
I think I just had
a contraction.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.177
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Did she just say...</i>

09:39.179 --> 09:40.645
Like a baby
contraction?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.180
I think so.
Uh-oh.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.715
I don't know,
I've never had one.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.983
So my stomach got all tight

09:44.985 --> 09:46.217
And then I felt this pressure...

09:46.219 --> 09:47.852
Okay, so...
So what now?
Ooh.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.087
What do we... Do?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.990
We time them,
my ob said. Um...

09:51.992 --> 09:53.692
I don't go to the hospital
unless it's four minutes apart--

09:53.694 --> 09:54.993
Ah!
Okay, I'll time them,
I'm timing them.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.227
Oh...
All right?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.063
Oh, there it is again.
What? What?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.598
Take deep breaths,
I think.
Uh-huh?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.865
In and out.
Uh-huh...?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.167
Good.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.171
Okay.
Okay.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.372
Okay.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.907
Jane...
Yeah?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.675
...Those were definitely
less than a minute apart.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.178
I think we should probably
go to the hospital. Right now.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.086
Man:
<i>They're called braxton hicks</i>
<i>contractions.</i>

10:21.088 --> 10:22.887
Or practice contractions,
we also call them.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.256
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Huh? What a letdown.</i>

10:25.258 --> 10:26.725
So that wasn't real labor?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.193
No, it was
a false alarm.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.095
Just your body
getting ready to give birth.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.630
I'm sorry.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.098
No, don't be.
We got a dress rehearsal in.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.766
I got here
in just under nine minutes.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.234
So you know
the difference...

10:36.236 --> 10:38.336
It's pretty hard to talk
through real contractions.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.305
Plus, with braxton hicks
if you put your feet up

10:40.307 --> 10:42.273
And drink a glass of water,
they'll subside.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.642
Real contractions won't.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.377
Gotcha. Thanks.
This won't happen again.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.878
No problem.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.313
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.252
Rafael:
Michael.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.820
It was false labor.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.089
Jane's just
changing now, so...

10:58.091 --> 10:59.424
You can go, I'll give
her a ride home.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.059
Oh, I'll just wait
to say good-bye.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.428
I'll tell her you said good-bye.
You can go.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.130
It's okay.
I'll wait.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.698
Of course you will.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.199
Because you're always
just here...

11:08.201 --> 11:09.968
Waiting, aren't you?

11:09.970 --> 11:12.270
Hoping that she comes
running back to you, right?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.338
You know, what I am
or am not doing with jane

11:13.340 --> 11:15.073
Is none of your
business, is it?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.374
Since you broke up
with her.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.976
Why don't you just admit
that you want her back?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.044
Just be man enough
to admit it.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.045
Okay, you know what? Fine.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.246
I do want her back.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.914
Are you gonna
do something about it?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.149
Stop hiding behind your
badge for five seconds,

11:24.151 --> 11:25.150
Maybe I will.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.418
Take your best shot.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.020
Emergency room's
right over there.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.388
Oh, yeah.
What's going on?

11:30.390 --> 11:31.723
Jane, uh, I was just
waiting to say good-bye.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.091
Uh, jane, let's go.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.161
I'd be happy to give you
a ride, if you wanted one.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.729
She doesn't need a ride.
Why don't you
let her speak, man?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.164
I did.
Stop it!
Are you serious?

11:39.166 --> 11:41.199
Doing this, right now,
in the hospital?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.102
My grandma's nearby.
I'm gonna call her for a ride.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.937
Jane? Jane... That...
That's not necessary.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.005
Yes, it is.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.273
Because I don't want to be

11:48.275 --> 11:49.808
With either one of you
right now.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.016
Wow, this place
is kind of depressing.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.284
That smell...

11:59.286 --> 12:00.385
That smell...

12:00.387 --> 12:01.953
Is me.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.388
Because I'm in prison.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.256
I'm sorry, mother.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.459
I know; I know
it's not pleasant, okay?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.794
But I do have some good news.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.429
Is it about my appeal?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.832
Well, uh, relatively good news.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.800
Um, rafael asked me
to dinner tomorrow,

12:15.802 --> 12:17.869
At trivolo's.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.305
The italian place,

12:20.307 --> 12:22.941
It's happening, mother,
between us.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.342
Don't be naive.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.811
He's having a baby
with another woman.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.480
They will be
bonded forever.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.482
You know, you're being
really negative right now.
Oh!

12:30.484 --> 12:31.483
I apologize.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.752
Probably because I'm in prison.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.755
(doorbell rings)

12:38.357 --> 12:39.824
Hey.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.793
Hi.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.796
Look, I'm so sorry
about what happened...

12:44.798 --> 12:45.864
At the hospital.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.365
I feel terrible.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.135
It's just that,
seeing him there...

12:50.137 --> 12:51.402
He drove me.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.071
He's my friend.
Come on, jane.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.539
You heard what he said.
That's not what he wants.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.374
Honestly, it's none
of your business.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.277
You broke up with me,
remember?

13:00.913 --> 13:02.280
What?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.948
Latin love narrator:
<i>Tell her, man.</i>

13:03.950 --> 13:06.384
<i>It's now or never.</i>

13:06.386 --> 13:08.887
I have been waiting for
the right time,

13:08.889 --> 13:12.223
But there is no...
Right time or place.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.994
I made a mistake...

13:15.996 --> 13:18.129
Breaking up with you.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.432
I was in a dark place,
my dad died,

13:21.434 --> 13:24.435
The hotel was falling apart,
and I couldn't handle that,

13:24.437 --> 13:26.137
And a relationship,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.406
And I knew that I was
letting you down...

13:28.408 --> 13:31.409
So, instead of fighting for you,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.511
I walked away.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.113
And I shouldn't
have done that.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.082
What are you...
What are you talking about?

13:38.084 --> 13:39.417
I wish that
I could take it back,

13:39.419 --> 13:41.319
Make another decision.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.587
You said you didn't love me.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.289
That wasn't true.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.858
I... I didn't think
that I was good for you,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.927
And so I thought that's
what you needed to hear,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.428
But I do love you, jane.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.130
Of course I love you!

13:52.132 --> 13:55.567
And you and this baby,
that's all that matters to me.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.335
You broke my heart.
I know. I...

13:57.337 --> 13:58.970
And now you're saying
that you don't mean it,

13:58.972 --> 14:02.507
No, that's not what I'm say...
No-- yes, yes,
that is what you're saying,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.909
And-and it did happen,
and I, I want you to get out!

14:04.911 --> 14:05.910
Listen, please...
No!

14:05.912 --> 14:07.512
Just go!

14:23.495 --> 14:25.296
Ma, I'm sure.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.532
Nothing's changed-- you don't
have to call every hour.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.133
All right? Just focus
on dress rehearsal.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.134
(doorbell rings)

14:30.136 --> 14:31.970
Hey, someone's here.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.972
Yes, I'll check in
after my interview.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.406
Love you, bye.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.875
Love to rogelio.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.880
(sighs)

14:43.282 --> 14:45.416
Hi. I was getting ready
to leave, actually.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.385
I have a meeting.
Oh, about grad school?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.621
Mm-hmm.
That's great, cool.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.489
Um, I'll be
quick, I just...

14:51.491 --> 14:53.458
I wanted to apologize
about yesterday.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.460
I feel really badly.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.428
And, uh...

14:57.430 --> 15:00.431
To make it up to you, I
made you this playlist

15:00.433 --> 15:02.634
For when you go
into real labor.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.235
â™ª ah, push it...

15:04.237 --> 15:05.670
(chuckles)

15:05.672 --> 15:07.338
I also included
"born this way"

15:07.340 --> 15:09.340
And r.E.M.'s
"everybody hurts."

15:09.342 --> 15:10.575
So...

15:10.577 --> 15:11.609
Thanks.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.344
And look, I...

15:13.346 --> 15:15.546
I meant what I said
about us being friends.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.283
If that's all you want,
I'm totally cool with it.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.654
But, um, is that
all you want?

15:22.656 --> 15:24.989
I mean, jane, am
I imagining this,

15:24.991 --> 15:28.693
Or is something happening
lately with us?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.695
You're not imagining it.

15:30.697 --> 15:35.333
But I don't know
where it's coming from, and...

15:35.335 --> 15:38.336
I mean, there's so much up
in the air,

15:38.338 --> 15:42.240
And with you it is safe
and familiar and...
Oh, wow.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.675
Safe and familiar, huh?
I-I didn't

15:43.677 --> 15:45.343
Mean it like that.
You know what,

15:45.345 --> 15:47.345
To be clear, I, uh...

15:47.347 --> 15:49.180
I don't want
to be your safe choice,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.582
The reality
to rafael the fantasy.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.085
I know that.
Well, and if I am,
if that's how it is,

15:54.087 --> 15:56.521
Or if that's
how you feel at all,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.356
Then tell me.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.091
Because I'm not interested.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.664
Good luck with your interview.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.307
Nadine:
Michael.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.742
What the hell are
you doing back here?

16:17.744 --> 16:20.178
Stand. Put your
hands up. Turn around.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.181
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You remember nadine, right?</i>

16:34.693 --> 16:36.594
What do you want?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.663
I want to propose a deal.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.465
Man:
<i>Here's the thing,</i>

16:40.467 --> 16:43.601
While I was very impressed
with your passionate e-mail,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.636
It doesn't change
the fact

16:45.638 --> 16:47.238
That the application deadline
has passed.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.641
Yes, I know. I've had
some extenuating circumstances.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.410
And I did a little research,

16:52.412 --> 16:55.213
And you guys only took
six candidates this year.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.614
And you took seven
the year before that

16:56.616 --> 16:58.483
And nine the year before that,

16:58.485 --> 17:02.453
Which is to say...

17:02.455 --> 17:04.088
(moans softly)

17:04.090 --> 17:07.458
(exhales)
...Some discretion involved...

17:07.460 --> 17:09.060
I know I
missed the dea...

17:09.062 --> 17:10.695
Can you give me a minute?

17:10.697 --> 17:14.298
Latin lover narrator
<i>hmm. Another braxton hicks.</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:16.467
<i>She had a few on the bus</i>
<i>on the way over.</i>

17:16.469 --> 17:17.635
Ms. Villanueva,

17:17.637 --> 17:19.337
Are you all right?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.572
Fine! Just... Mm.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.808
Just gathering my thoughts.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.077
<i>Water. Drink more water, jane.</i>

17:27.813 --> 17:31.482
Ooh. Sorry,
this happened yesterday,

17:31.484 --> 17:32.784
And it's not a big deal.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.120
So, whew, where was I?

17:36.122 --> 17:37.422
Oh, yes.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.357
Extenuating circumstances...

17:39.359 --> 17:41.125
Where'd you go?
Where have you been?

17:41.127 --> 17:43.694
I left you, and I made contact
with my handler.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.830
Sin rostro's handler?
Yeah, they picked me up,
they blindfolded me,

17:45.832 --> 17:48.132
There was a plane ride...
Did they bring
you to rose?

17:48.134 --> 17:51.135
Did you see her?
No. No. But they think
that I'm still working for them.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.337
So I was able
to get information.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.174
To help you get sin rostro
once and for all.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.775
And in exchange,

17:57.777 --> 18:00.178
I want my family safe

18:00.180 --> 18:03.247
And leniency for me.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.850
I can't push for a deal
without knowing what
you're giving me here.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.253
I know where the plastic
surgeon's been hiding out.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.090
<i>Dr. Moncada, the one</i>
<i>who changes faces for rose.</i>

18:14.293 --> 18:17.728
And there are also rumors
that he changed her face.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.564
And if he did,
he is the only one

18:19.566 --> 18:21.199
That knows
what she looks like now.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.201
So...

18:23.203 --> 18:26.137
That's what I have.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.139
Okay.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.807
I'll check it out.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.881
(moaning)
ms. Villanueva,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.583
I really think
you should head home

18:38.585 --> 18:41.219
Or to your doctor...
No, no, no.
That's not necessary.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.221
Even if they are real,
they're really spaced out.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.789
I think.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.857
You weren't keeping track,
were you?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.792
I-I wasn't.
It's okay.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.895
I just need you to understand
how much this means to me.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.463
I definitely understand.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.765
<i>I think we all understand,</i>
<i>jane.</i>

18:54.767 --> 18:56.267
Now really, go.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.668
I'm a doctor

18:57.670 --> 18:58.903
Of literature, not medicine.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.138
Oh.
(chuckles)

19:00.140 --> 19:02.206
(grunts)

19:02.208 --> 19:03.875
Thank you.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.747
I'm on the bus.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.749
What? Why?
Grandma had the car,

19:11.751 --> 19:13.918
And it was the quickest way
home. Plus, I wasn't really sure

19:13.920 --> 19:16.354
If they were real contractions,
but I think they are.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.889
How far apart are they?
Like,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.690
Every eight minutes.
So I'm-I'm just gonna...

19:19.692 --> 19:21.425
Go wait at home.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.161
Ooh...

19:23.896 --> 19:25.329
Oh. Okay.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.398
Seven minutes apart now.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.233
Jane, are you okay?
(moaning)

19:31.436 --> 19:35.306
Oh. Yeah. I'm okay.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.608
Should you get off the bus?
No. I'm, like, 15 minutes
from home.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.444
Listen, I should call rafael
before I have another one.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.812
Rafael:
<i>I am so sorry,</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:43.648
Petra. I just got off the phone
with jane

19:43.650 --> 19:47.185
And she went into labor
and we are having the baby.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.586
Rain check on dinner?

19:48.588 --> 19:51.355
Yes. Of course.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.591
Uh, hey...

19:53.593 --> 19:55.526
Good luck.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.827
Thanks.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.668
Okay, mom, gabrielle said
they're five minutes apart now.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.571
Who's gabrielle?
They're speeding up,
a nice lady on the bus.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.973
Just like mine did.
How far are you from home?

20:08.975 --> 20:10.441
I don't know. We're stuck
in traffic. I think

20:10.443 --> 20:11.842
There's an acc...
(moaning)

20:11.844 --> 20:13.744
What's going on?
Oh!

20:13.746 --> 20:15.813
Honey?
Hey, this is gabrielle.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.682
She's okay. She's
just contracting.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.518
How far apart are they?
Less then five minutes now.
Listen,

20:20.520 --> 20:22.386
I think she should
get to the hospital.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.355
We're right near st. Luke's.
I agree.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.524
Hey, is she okay?
She's in labor.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.492
She's in labor?
Oh, my god.
Here?

20:28.494 --> 20:29.527
Hi, mom. I'm back.
Gabrielle and I think

20:29.529 --> 20:30.962
That you should go
to the hospital.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.697
They're coming too fast.
Come on,

20:32.699 --> 20:33.864
Let's go talk
to the driver.

20:33.866 --> 20:34.966
Yeah. Go, go, go.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.667
(panting)

20:36.669 --> 20:38.502
Sorry to bother you,

20:38.504 --> 20:40.471
Do you know long
we'll be?
She's in labor.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.506
Now?
Mm-hmm.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.676
Yeah, and my mom wants me
to go to the hospital.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.547
She wants to talk to you,
actually.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.415
Hello?
Look,

20:51.417 --> 20:53.417
When I was pregnant with jane,
I went from eight minutes apart

20:53.419 --> 20:54.619
To delivering in an hour.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.554
Jane is now five minutes apart.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.556
Do you want her
to have a baby on that bus?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.258
No.
Man:
Let's go!

21:00.260 --> 21:01.392
Take her to the hospital!
Take her!
Okay,

21:01.394 --> 21:03.261
We're going to the hospital.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.663
(passengers applaud, cheer)

21:10.636 --> 21:12.270
<i>(jane groans)</i>

21:12.272 --> 21:13.471
Gabrielle: They're
every four minutes now.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.306
Is there a doctor
on board?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.307
Man:
I'm a vet.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.541
(groans)

21:17.543 --> 21:19.610
(people speak indistinctly)

21:40.499 --> 21:42.500
Gabrielle: Is this
as fast as you can go?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.602
Didn't you ever
see    <i>speed?</i>

21:44.604 --> 21:46.404
(horn honking)

21:57.616 --> 21:59.016
Man:
Good luck!

21:59.018 --> 22:01.018
Yeah, bye.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.586
Rogelio:
Jane.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.657
Go forward and bring
another angel into this world.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.462
Now!
Okay. Bye.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.531
(cheering)

22:24.576 --> 22:26.577
Um, jane,
a-are you okay?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.412
Do you want to try one
of those positions that we...

22:28.414 --> 22:29.480
Shush.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.116
Breathe,
in and out.

22:35.053 --> 22:37.455
Okay.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.791
Now would be a good time for the
epidural if you're planning to.

22:40.793 --> 22:44.462
Should I at least try
to labor naturally?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.630
I mean, you didn't get
an epidural.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.067
Woman (screaming):
Oh, my god!

22:50.069 --> 22:52.069
Yeah, let's go
with that epidural.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.537
Xiomara:
<i>Are you freaking kidding me?!</i>

22:53.539 --> 22:56.540
There is not one available
flight tonight?

22:56.542 --> 22:59.577
No, noreen,
I-I don't think you're lying.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.413
I-I'm just wondering
if maybe you missed a plane.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.716
Fine, I-I'll keep that first one
in the morning. Thanks.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.720
It really is hard to rehearse
without the thunderous applause.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.888
What is it?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.123
Was I off-key?

23:12.125 --> 23:13.958
(gasps) was I giving
it too much hip?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.727
Jane's in labor, but there were
no available flights tonight,

23:16.729 --> 23:18.062
So I'm leaving first thing
in the morning.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.599
Which means I have
to miss the show.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.634
I'm sorry.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.971
I don't think it affects the act
too much, though, right?

23:31.443 --> 23:32.743
It stopped?

23:34.746 --> 23:36.180
Not "stopped."

23:36.182 --> 23:37.648
Your labor's
just stalled.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.917
Oh, there's another
contraction.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.552
Latin lover narrator:
<i>On the bright side,</i>

23:41.554 --> 23:43.421
<i>Jane is loving this epidural.</i>

23:43.423 --> 23:45.723
It looks like we could
be in for a long night.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.158
You should try to
sleep a little.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.559
I'll check back.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.760
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.828
<i>Gracias.</i>

23:52.931 --> 23:54.165
Abuela.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.100
Go home, get some sleep.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.737
Then we'll call you--
you live five minutes away.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.539
Come on.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.607
I need you well-rested
when the baby comes.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.520
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Talk about a pregnant pause.</i>

24:17.656 --> 24:19.623
So about yesterday...
No, no.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.058
No, n-n-n-n-n-no.

24:22.494 --> 24:23.694
I'm so zen right now.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.129
No talk about
yesterday.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.997
Baby stuff only.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.632
We need to talk names.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.802
Yes, names, uh...
We were down to three.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.806
(machine chiming)

24:36.675 --> 24:38.108
Rogelio.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.479
I know you're upset
I'm missing the show.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.880
That is not why
I'm upset, xiomara.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.782
And the fact that you
don't know why I'm upset

24:44.784 --> 24:46.650
Makes me doubly upset.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.220
What are you
talking about?

24:49.222 --> 24:51.655
I'm talking about how my
daughter is about to give birth,

24:51.657 --> 24:54.058
But you assume I would
have no interest

24:54.060 --> 24:55.693
In flying home to be there.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.695
You would want
to come back?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.663
Of course I'm
coming back.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.065
I already bought
my own ticket.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.234
Premium first
class, of course.

25:03.236 --> 25:05.769
Rogelio, I didn't think
you would because I know

25:05.771 --> 25:07.805
How important
this show is to you.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.240
You've been trying to impress
this director nonstop

25:09.242 --> 25:10.975
So you could play
jesus christ superstar.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.977
There are many
jesus christs.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.678
There's only one jane.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.615
Nothing is more important
than family to me.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.818
And I am hurt that after all
my efforts to join this one,

25:20.820 --> 25:22.853
You didn't know that.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.089
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it was raining quarters

25:25.091 --> 25:26.757
Before you got here.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.265
So we decided then.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.166
Yes.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.276
Nina.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.111
I love it.
Mm, me, too.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.113
Nina villanueva.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.682
Has such a nice flow.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.817
Um, don't you mean nina solano?

25:53.819 --> 25:55.819
Oh. No, I didn't.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.555
Oh.

25:57.557 --> 26:01.125
I just assumed that
it would be a solano.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.827
I'm a villanueva,
we aren't married.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.930
Well, for the record,
I wanted to be.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.566
We can go with a combo.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.901
Though I don't love hyphens.
Neither do I.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.237
One middle, one last?
Has to be. I'm assuming
you want the last?

26:13.239 --> 26:14.772
I assume you do, too?
I do.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.040
But I'm willing
to negotiate.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.609
I will take the
middle position,

26:18.611 --> 26:22.846
Which we both recognize
is the inferior position,

26:22.848 --> 26:26.917
But I will need 50%
less anger from you.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.019
What are you
talking about?
I know it's a big ask,

26:29.021 --> 26:30.854
But keep in mind, this
was my only sample

26:30.856 --> 26:34.658
So I am giving up the chance
to pass down my family's name.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.261
Fine.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.762
Yeah.

26:38.764 --> 26:39.964
I'm not feeling that.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.799
I got to feel it.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.134
Otherwise, you are looking
at a straight-up coin toss.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.870
Look, I don't want
to fight with you.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.772
I've been thinking
about things,

26:48.774 --> 26:50.941
And the way you broke up
with me sucked.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.876
But still,

26:52.878 --> 26:54.712
It was a good thing
that you did it.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.946
No, it wasn't.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.115
We want different things
from life.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.117
Your business needs
to take priority.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.653
No, it doesn't, and it's
not going to anymore.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.355
Oh, come one, that's so easy
for you to say.

27:04.357 --> 27:06.357
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All right, lay it out, buddy.</i>

27:06.359 --> 27:09.393
Look, things are
different now.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.028
The reason I didn't
go to Spain wasn't

27:11.030 --> 27:13.030
Because the meeting
was canceled.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.132
It was because you
were dilated, jane,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.301
And the thought of
missing the birth,

27:17.303 --> 27:19.737
Just the
smallest chance.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.372
So I didn't go
to the meeting.

27:21.374 --> 27:22.640
And they sold the company.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.074
Your dad's company?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.209
Yeah.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.211
And I'm glad,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.413
Because somehow with
my mom being so awful,

27:29.415 --> 27:31.415
I started to idolize him.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.218
What you were saying
before was right.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.419
I don't want his life.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.054
He wasn't a good dad.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.056
I don't want to be
anything like him.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.892
And I won't be.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.028
And I just want
you to know that.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.231
I do.

27:49.934 --> 27:52.436
And I feel, like, 50% better.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.438
So...

27:54.440 --> 27:58.709
Nina solano
villanueva it is.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.450
I brought you
something.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.719
It's a picture.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.989
And you're in it.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.391
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Now there's an offer</i>
<i>he can't refuse.</i>

28:14.393 --> 28:16.894
It's the best I could do
in the middle of the night

28:16.896 --> 28:18.328
At the business
center.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.830
It's the day
jane was born.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.899
And it's okay
that you're mad.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.335
But you also have
to get over it.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.871
Because that's
what families do.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.808
They get mad at each other,
and then they make up.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.211
And you're family.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.280
Okay?

28:36.282 --> 28:38.916
Thank you, xiomara.

28:38.918 --> 28:42.119
I will keep this picture
close to my heart forever.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.723
Come on, let's
get some sleep.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.191
Our flight's early.
Yes.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.927
Rogelio de la vega!

28:49.929 --> 28:51.195
(women screaming)

29:01.306 --> 29:03.240
(screaming)

29:05.110 --> 29:07.478
Michael: <i>I don't have</i>
<i>a good feeling about this.</i>

29:07.480 --> 29:09.313
Thought you said
your source was solid.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.215
Yeah, let's hope
I was right.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.454
Dr. Moncada!

29:17.456 --> 29:19.523
There's nowhere to go!

29:20.458 --> 29:22.526
You're outnumbered.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.529
Detective,
he's over here.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.765
Latin lover narrator:
<i>So nadine was right.</i>

29:27.767 --> 29:29.833
<i>This is where</i>
<i>the plastic surgeon lives.</i>

29:30.835 --> 29:33.036
<i>Or lived.</i>

29:33.038 --> 29:35.105
Damn it.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.348
(alarm chimes)

29:44.350 --> 29:46.483
Rogelio:
â™ª it's another beautiful day

29:46.485 --> 29:47.885
â™ª to be rogelio

29:47.887 --> 29:49.853
â™ª wake up, rogelio...

29:49.855 --> 29:52.422
â™ª wake up, rogelio

29:52.424 --> 29:54.792
â™ª it's another beautiful day
to be roge... â™ª

29:55.560 --> 29:58.796
Oh, my god.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.798
My head is killing me.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.967
Why are you screaming
at the top of your lungs?

30:05.570 --> 30:07.204
What happened last night?

30:07.206 --> 30:08.205
I don't know.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.274
Rogelifans like to party.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.178
(cell phone chimes)

30:14.180 --> 30:15.879
(gasps)
oh, my god.

30:15.881 --> 30:16.947
(snorts)
what? What is it?

30:16.949 --> 30:18.282
Jane's dilated
to eight.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.884
Hurry, we got to get
to the airport.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.521
Looks like you're at nine,
jane-- almost there.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.123
That's good news.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.858
It's just...

30:27.860 --> 30:29.927
My mom and my dad are
in the air flying...

30:33.064 --> 30:34.398
I can't make the deal.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.833
But my information
was good.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.034
The guy was
dead, nadine.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.902
We have no leads
on sin rostro.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.904
We need concrete information.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.906
Cops don't exactly love
dirty cops.

30:42.908 --> 30:44.541
I'm not dirty, michael.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.844
You know me.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.281
Let me talk to armstrong,
see what he says.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.417
I can't promise you anything.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.152
Doctor:
<i>Okay, jane,</i>

30:55.154 --> 30:57.187
It's time to start pushing.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.289
It could take
time, okay?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.991
Your mom's plane
is landing.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.060
She's not gonna make it,
not with traffic.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.895
It's okay.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.196
I can do this.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.498
Uh, you know,
I'll call michael.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.335
He can meet the plane,
give them a police escort back.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.903
Really?

31:12.905 --> 31:14.371
Yes, there's no guarantee
that she'll be here,

31:14.373 --> 31:15.639
But at least there's
a chance, okay?
Okay.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.140
Mm-hmm.
Okay, jane.

31:17.142 --> 31:18.976
It's time to
start to push.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.979
One, two, three...

31:21.981 --> 31:23.614
Change of plans.
Jane's in labor.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.649
I have to pick up her
parents from the airport,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.651
Bring 'em to
the hospital.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.119
I'll be back.

31:32.156 --> 31:34.324
(door closes)

31:34.326 --> 31:37.527
(car door closes,
engine starting)

31:37.529 --> 31:39.563
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, michael!</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:42.332
<i>What a rookie mistake.</i>

31:49.040 --> 31:51.375
(moaning)
we're gonna need a little more!

31:51.377 --> 31:52.676
(crying)

31:52.678 --> 31:54.177
Hey, okay.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.379
Deep breaths.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.948
(both breathing deeply)

32:00.418 --> 32:02.653
Come on, jane!

32:02.655 --> 32:05.455
(distantly):
<i>Push! A little more!</i>

32:05.457 --> 32:06.924
(cries)

32:06.926 --> 32:09.192
<i>Okay, okay!</i>

32:09.194 --> 32:11.695
Jane: <i>I can't.</i>
<i>Doctor:</i> <i>Keep going, jane!</i>

32:15.199 --> 32:17.434
(cries)

32:17.436 --> 32:18.702
Rafael:
<i>It's been an hour.</i>

32:18.704 --> 32:20.504
<i>Another push, jane!</i>
<i>No.</i>

32:20.506 --> 32:23.006
I can't.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.141
I'm too tired!

32:24.143 --> 32:25.943
(cries):
I can't!

32:25.945 --> 32:27.678
(door opens)

32:27.680 --> 32:29.546
Is there a baby yet?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.949
(gasps)
mom!

32:31.951 --> 32:33.550
Oh, baby!
(both crying)

32:33.552 --> 32:35.218
Mom!

32:35.220 --> 32:37.287
Oh, I'm so tired.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.723
I know, honey.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.725
Oh, I... Oh...

32:41.727 --> 32:43.460
Five more minutes of pain

32:43.462 --> 32:47.030
For a lifetime of happiness.

32:47.032 --> 32:50.033
So push or I'll yank
that kid out myself!

32:50.035 --> 32:53.003
(laughing)

32:53.005 --> 32:56.039
Okay, okay.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.042
Okay.
Here we go.

32:59.044 --> 33:03.013
One, two and...

33:03.015 --> 33:05.315
(baby crying)

33:05.317 --> 33:07.751
Doctor:
<i>It's a boy.</i>

33:07.753 --> 33:09.987
What?!

33:09.989 --> 33:12.489
A boy?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.993
We don't know
anything about boys.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.728
Well, I'm here, and I'm happy
to answer any questions.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.363
Nurse:
He looks great.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.034
A boy.
(crying)

33:25.470 --> 33:27.137
A beautiful boy.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.339
He's beautiful.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.607
We can't name him nina, right?

33:30.609 --> 33:33.043
No.
(laughs)

33:33.045 --> 33:34.778
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that at this very moment</i>

33:34.780 --> 33:37.748
<i>After everything...</i>

33:37.750 --> 33:40.617
Jane:
<i>But I've never had sex!</i>

33:40.619 --> 33:42.619
I'm proposing.
I'm pregnant.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.222
â™ª

33:49.694 --> 33:52.362
Jane:
<i>You want to break up.</i>

33:52.364 --> 33:54.264
Michael:
<i>Am I imagining this</i>
<i>or is something</i>

33:54.266 --> 33:56.633
<i>Happening with us?</i>

33:56.635 --> 33:59.036
Latin lover narrator:
<i>...Jane's heart was full.</i>

34:12.750 --> 34:15.352
(sighs)
I meant what I said, jane.

34:15.354 --> 34:18.422
I never stopped loving you.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.824
This is what I want.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.726
Our family.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.194
I know.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.762
And I'll think about it.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.764
But not right now.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.766
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Right now, the only boy</i>

34:29.768 --> 34:32.836
<i>Jane wanted to think about</i>
<i>was her son.</i>

34:32.838 --> 34:35.105
I do have an idea though.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.174
For a name.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.080
Ready?

34:43.082 --> 34:44.347
Mm-hmm.

34:46.117 --> 34:49.619
His name is mateo.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.154
(gasps)

34:51.156 --> 34:54.124
Oh, janie.

34:54.126 --> 34:57.127
That's my dad's name.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.130
Well, there's more.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.164
It's kind of a long name.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.567
"kind of"?
Okay.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.302
It's...

35:05.304 --> 35:07.170
Mateo...

35:07.172 --> 35:08.839
Gloriano...

35:08.841 --> 35:11.875
Rogelio...

35:11.877 --> 35:13.376
Solano...

35:13.378 --> 35:14.811
Villanueva.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.380
You named him after me?

35:17.382 --> 35:18.582
Yes.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.117
It's in there, but we-we're just

35:20.119 --> 35:22.185
Gonna call him mateo though.
Yeah.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.855
We'll see how
nicknames develop.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.757
Matelio, perhaps?

35:27.759 --> 35:29.359
(laughs)

35:29.361 --> 35:31.394
Xiomara:
It's perfect.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.232
He's perfect.

35:41.205 --> 35:44.141
It's miami-dade memorial
again for mr. Solano.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.742
And he told me
not to bother him.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.210
He's in his office
with his sister.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.578
He's packing to go
back to the hospital

35:48.580 --> 35:50.280
To spend the night
with his son.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.681
What?

35:51.683 --> 35:53.717
He had a son?

35:53.719 --> 35:55.352
Uh, yes, ma'am.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.787
Anyway, look, I don't
want to bug him.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.289
And they said they could
speak with mrs. Solano?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.925
Which you were...
Fine.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.360
I'll take it.

36:08.299 --> 36:11.301
Hi, this is mrs. Solano.
How can I help you?

36:14.272 --> 36:16.740
Get to the point.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.646
Excuse me?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.281
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that petra's first thought</i>

36:24.283 --> 36:26.216
<i>Upon hearing what she heard</i>
<i>was "rafael."</i>

36:26.218 --> 36:29.219
<i>She had to tell rafael.</i>

36:29.221 --> 36:31.321
<i>But then she heard this...</i>

36:31.323 --> 36:33.957
Rafael: I mean, I feel a little
bad about manipulating petra.

36:33.959 --> 36:37.827
But I just want her
out of my life.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.197
I have a family now.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.432
With jane.

36:45.469 --> 36:47.437
Hey.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.738
(door closes)
well, I'll be quick.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.373
I just want to see him.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.709
Considering I broke about
20 traffic laws to get here.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.277
Can I?

36:54.279 --> 36:55.345
Mm-hmm.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.718
Wow.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.386
He's so cute.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.455
(laughs)
I think so.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.224
I'm biased, so...

37:07.226 --> 37:08.491
No, he is.

37:08.493 --> 37:09.859
He looks just like you.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.562
You think so?
So listen...

37:12.564 --> 37:14.397
Um, about before...

37:14.399 --> 37:15.899
Michael...
No, I just want to say

37:15.901 --> 37:17.434
I don't want you to worry

37:17.436 --> 37:19.002
About any of that right now.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.471
You just focus on mateo.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.507
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I would be remiss</i>
<i>if I didn't point out</i>

37:24.509 --> 37:28.411
<i>That this was the most perfect</i>
<i>thing michael could have said.</i>

37:28.413 --> 37:30.513
Well, anyways,
I should probably get going.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.282
Okay.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.717
Okay.

37:33.719 --> 37:34.751
I'll talk to you soon.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.454
Yeah, see you.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.730
(door closes)

37:49.533 --> 37:51.534
Lieutenant?

37:51.536 --> 37:52.736
It worked.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.305
She's gone.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.407
Yeah, the tracker's

37:57.409 --> 37:59.442
In her phone.
She'll head back

37:59.444 --> 38:01.278
To sin rostro's
people eventually.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.780
She's got nowhere else to go.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.449
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Huh. Shouldn't have</i>
<i>underestimated him.</i>

38:06.451 --> 38:08.918
<i>Seems like he had a plan.</i>

38:08.920 --> 38:10.553
<i>And speaking of plans...</i>

38:10.555 --> 38:11.755
Mrs. Solano,
let me get diane.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.923
I know she wanted to
speak to you directly.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.025
Yes, I should think she would.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.493
<i>Oh, I should probably</i>

38:16.495 --> 38:17.827
<i>Fill in some gaps.</i>

38:17.829 --> 38:19.963
<i>Remember that call</i>
<i>petra took earlier?</i>

38:19.965 --> 38:23.600
Hello? Yeah, this is
mrs. Solano. How can I help you?

38:23.602 --> 38:26.303
<i>Well, it's time to show you</i>
<i>the other side of that call.</i>

38:26.305 --> 38:27.470
My name is diane.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.706
I work at miami-dade memorial.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.409
We've recently taken over
the fertility clinic

38:32.411 --> 38:35.345
That housed mr. Solano's
original sperm sample.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.013
The clinic was a disaster.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.782
We've just finished sorting
through all of their mistakes.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.517
Get to the point.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.819
Your husband's
original sperm sample

38:42.821 --> 38:44.721
Was split into two vials.

38:44.723 --> 38:45.989
One was misplaced.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.691
We've just found it.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.793
Diane:
<i>Mrs. Solano?</i>

38:51.329 --> 38:53.530
Is that my husband's sample?

38:53.532 --> 38:55.965
Yes, and again,
we are so embarrassed.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.802
We're happy to continue
to store it free of charge.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.738
Well, unfortunately,
I can't really trust you.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.607
Can I? So...

39:04.609 --> 39:06.643
I'm taking it myself.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.877
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

39:07.879 --> 39:11.481
<i>Or sister!</i>

39:21.926 --> 39:24.461
Hey, how's jane?

39:24.463 --> 39:26.529
Good. Nursing.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.365
Yeah.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.133
What are you
looking for in there?

39:30.135 --> 39:31.935
If you must know,
my concealer.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.737
It's been a very emotional day.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.139
So I'm a little
rough around the eyes.

39:37.508 --> 39:38.508
Is this yours?

39:38.510 --> 39:40.443
No.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.645
Maybe it's our last rehearsal?

39:42.647 --> 39:43.747
I hope it's not a sex tape.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.515
Yeah, you and me both.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.388
Oh, good, we both have
our clothes on.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.756
Yes.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.491
It... What...?
Is that...?

39:54.493 --> 39:56.860
Wait, why are
we in a chapel?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.628
I-I don't know.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.698
Why, why are we
holding hands?

40:01.700 --> 40:02.832
Why are we walking?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.033
Stop walking, rogelio!

40:04.035 --> 40:06.169
Wait, this has to be
some kind of joke!

40:06.171 --> 40:07.470
I mean, we were both so drunk.

40:07.472 --> 40:08.638
Xiomara:
I totally do!

40:08.640 --> 40:10.507
I totally do, too!

40:10.509 --> 40:11.841
Cher impersonator:
And by the power vested in me

40:11.843 --> 40:13.510
By the state of nevada

40:13.512 --> 40:15.011
And the goddess cher,

40:15.013 --> 40:17.714
Who is with us here
in spirit tonight,

40:17.716 --> 40:19.549
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.950
You may kiss the bride.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.019
(onlookers cheering)

40:25.623 --> 40:27.957
(whoops)

40:27.959 --> 40:31.795
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, I am not</i>
<i>a huge baby person,</i>

40:31.797 --> 40:33.963
<i>But that is one cute kid.</i>

40:33.965 --> 40:35.565
(door opens)

40:35.567 --> 40:37.700
Hey there, I'm helen.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.968
I'm the new nurse on call.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.203
Hi.
I hear

40:40.205 --> 40:41.604
You're our champion nurser.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.539
Oh, it's all mateo.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.740
He's very smart.

40:43.742 --> 40:44.974
Well, according
to his chart,

40:44.976 --> 40:46.209
He hasn't had
his hearing test.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.444
Oh, it was a full house earlier.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.511
I'm sorry.

40:48.513 --> 40:49.712
No problem. I'll take him.

40:49.714 --> 40:50.880
It'll be ten minutes.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.216
No needles.
Just a high-pitched sound.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.751
Take a quick nap.
He'll be right back.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.085
(laughs)

40:56.087 --> 40:58.555
I know your hearing's perfect.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.623
And I love you.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.828
There you go.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.802
Bye, mateo.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.698
(crickets chirping)

41:41.700 --> 41:45.502
(whistling)

41:45.504 --> 41:49.172
Latin lover narrator:
<i>No! It can't be!</i>

41:56.947 --> 41:58.681
To state the obvious, friends--

41:58.683 --> 42:01.117
<i>Where in the world</i>
<i>is she taking</i>

42:01.119 --> 42:04.287
<i>Mateo gloriano rogelio</i>
<i>solano villanueva?</i>

42:04.289 --> 42:07.123
<i>And I'd love to tell you</i>

42:07.125 --> 42:09.192
<i>But it will have to be later</i>

42:09.194 --> 42:12.729
<i>Because this brings us</i>
<i>to the end of part one.</i>

42:12.731 --> 42:14.998
