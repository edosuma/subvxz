WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:04.961
Hey, pal.Hey, friend.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.659
Whoa, does my hair
always look like this?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.748
Like you slept on it funny?
Yeah.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.142
What's up?Well, not much.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.057
Your kidney misses you.
Wanted to say hello.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.928
[high-pitched]:
"I miss you, Gina." [chuckles]

00:15.972 --> 00:17.843
That's your kidney, obviously.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.498
Okay, what's going on?
You all right?

00:20.542 --> 00:21.847
I guess.

00:21.891 --> 00:22.848
[high-pitched]:
"Tell her the truth."

00:22.892 --> 00:24.850
Oh! Mm.
[chuckles]

00:25.851 --> 00:28.245
Um, I am
in a bit of a funk lately.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.031
I mean, here it is,
finally sweater season,

00:31.074 --> 00:33.120
and it's like I don't even care.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.861
Well, what do you usually do
to cheer yourself up?

00:35.905 --> 00:38.864
Have you stopped watching porn?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.345
What? No, I-I don't watch...

00:41.389 --> 00:44.000
Look, can we just talk
about my funk, please?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.437
Ooh, that sounds worse.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.178
I was just calling

00:48.222 --> 00:49.919
to see if you're free
for dinner.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.355
Maybe we can hang out?

00:51.399 --> 00:53.792
Oh, I wish. Two
of my night orderlies bailed.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.359
I got to cover.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.578
I can talk now, though.

00:56.621 --> 00:57.840
Okay, great.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.320
I don't have many people

00:59.363 --> 01:00.669
in my life I can turn to, so...[knock on door]

01:00.712 --> 01:02.018
[door opens]PETER:
Hey.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.367
You busy?[whispers]:
I got to go.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.673
Oh, yeah, no problem.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.849
And just so you know,
I don't watch...

01:06.892 --> 01:08.329
Come on in.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.721
We're in.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.594
GINA:
Oh.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.682
Oh, my.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.205
Okay.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.206
And there's more.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.729
Oh, they...

01:17.773 --> 01:20.384
They keep on coming.PETER:
I hold

01:20.428 --> 01:23.648
in my hand a petition
to replace the chef.

01:23.692 --> 01:24.780
We as a community...

01:24.823 --> 01:26.608
The food here blows.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.479
I was getting to that.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.785
Not fast enough.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.613
You promised us a new chef.

01:31.656 --> 01:35.225
One who won't set fire
to the kitchen every week.GINA: I know,

01:35.269 --> 01:36.792
and I'm so sorry.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.838
It's just...
I'm not the kind of person

01:39.882 --> 01:41.318
that fires people.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.885
I mean, you have no idea.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.496
I still go
to my pediatrician.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.194
I'll fire him.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.326
I like it.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.849
MEREDITH:
Gina,

01:50.893 --> 01:53.200
food is one of
the last pleasures that we have,

01:53.243 --> 01:55.506
and this man
is stealing it from us.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.205
I wholeheartedly agree.GINA:Jerry,

01:58.248 --> 01:59.902
you've been here, like, a week.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.599
Yeah, I'm a follower.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.601
Always have been.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.212
Oh, good, you found her.

02:05.255 --> 02:08.128

03:01.572 --> 03:04.184
Nailed it.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.622
Hey, Bert.
You got a minute?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.667
Sure, boss.Mmm.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.800
Ooh, smells good.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.323
Vegetable soup?Yep.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.196
With my secret ingredient:
steak.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.807
What? Well, then...

03:18.850 --> 03:19.982
Then you can't call it...

03:20.025 --> 03:21.897
Okay, um...

03:21.940 --> 03:23.420
Bert, we need to talk.

03:23.464 --> 03:27.859
I'm all ears. Well, technically,
just this one right here.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.862
Uh, so... So, this is
kind of hard for me,

03:30.906 --> 03:33.038
but you need to know

03:33.082 --> 03:36.041
that there's been a lot of
complaints about the food.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.565
Well, like my daddy
always said,

03:37.608 --> 03:41.221
"complaint" is just one letter
away from "compliment."

03:43.223 --> 03:44.267
I think

03:44.311 --> 03:45.877
your daddy
wasn't much of a speller.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.619
But, uh,
but back to why I'm here.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.230
Um, I...

03:50.273 --> 03:51.709
Did I ever show you the picture
of my little one

03:51.753 --> 03:52.710
getting confirmed?

03:52.754 --> 03:54.103
Oh. Oh.

03:54.146 --> 03:58.107
Oh, she's adorable.Yeah.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.674
And as soon as she gets
the back brace off,

03:59.717 --> 04:02.416
she'll be able to run and
jump with the other kids.

04:02.459 --> 04:03.765
We're all pulling for her.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.897
Um, so, listen, uh...Course, with my wife

04:05.941 --> 04:07.421
being sick with the alcoholism
and whatnot,

04:07.464 --> 04:09.684
I have to do
most of the parenting.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.294
But what can you
do? Raising kids:

04:11.338 --> 04:13.862
the hardest job
you'll ever love.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.560
Sure. Sure.
Speaking of jobs, um...

04:16.604 --> 04:19.259
And I am so grateful
for this one.That's...

04:19.302 --> 04:20.477
That's nice, but...Oh,

04:20.521 --> 04:21.522
and about the food.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.523
I know what the problem is.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.959
Oh, you do?Yes.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.440
Unsophisticated palates.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.921
I'm giving these people
cumin and paprika,

04:29.965 --> 04:31.488
but all they want
is salt and pepper.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.924
That's my bad.

04:32.968 --> 04:36.276
I'm always reaching
for the stars.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.540
Uh, I don't remember
anybody saying

04:39.583 --> 04:42.151
the food was too tasty.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.892
You know I love
those folks out there.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.894
Me, too.
That's why I bought the place.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.330
So you get it.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.464
It's all about
these wonderful, old bastards.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.597
They are the reason
that we are here.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.338
[voice breaking]: Don't
get me going. It's like I got

04:55.382 --> 04:58.298
24 grandmas and grandpas
out there.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.387
So, we good?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.345
I guess.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.608
Um, Bert, please,
please, ca...

05:04.652 --> 05:06.436
Oh. Can you...

05:06.480 --> 05:07.916
Bert. Bert, I...

05:07.959 --> 05:11.136
I really need you
to turn things around.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.747
In the words
of Mr. Bill Withers,

05:12.790 --> 05:14.531
lean on me.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.926
Okay. Thank you.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.319

STUART:We've talked about
it over and over,

05:34.638 --> 05:37.641
and she just blows me off
like nothing I say matters.

05:37.685 --> 05:38.729
Mm-hmm, go on.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.165
I mean, there's a right way

05:40.209 --> 05:41.819
and a wrong way to do things.
You get that.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.126
I do.It's common knowledge
you load a dishwasher

05:44.169 --> 05:46.171
with the bowls on top
so they don't flip over

05:46.215 --> 05:48.173
and fill with water.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.393
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.178
Why?Because you're wasting my life.

05:53.222 --> 05:54.702
Excuse me?How many years

05:54.745 --> 05:56.225
have you been coming to me,

05:56.268 --> 05:58.488
complaining about your wife
doing the laundry wrong,

05:58.532 --> 05:59.837
making the bed wrong,

05:59.881 --> 06:01.230
walking the dog wrong?

06:01.273 --> 06:03.188
Oh, and let's not forget
the controversy

06:03.232 --> 06:04.842
over which way
the toilet paper rolls.

06:04.886 --> 06:08.193
If it comes from the top,
you tear off a lot of squares.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.848
I don't care! Nobody cares!

06:10.892 --> 06:12.372
Your problems are ridiculous.

06:12.415 --> 06:15.070
Your wife, honestly,
should leave you.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.811
That's a little hurtful.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.466
Is it?! Is it hurtful?

06:19.509 --> 06:22.425
Do you realize
how close to death I was?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.993
And here I am.
A second chance, a new lease

06:25.036 --> 06:26.298
on life,
and what am I doing?

06:26.342 --> 06:27.996
I'm listening
to you bitch and moan

06:28.039 --> 06:29.345
about your
stupid freaking dishwasher.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.043
Where you going?I'm living my life.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.958
Starting right now!

06:39.224 --> 06:41.052
And obviously,
we didn't use the full hour,

06:41.096 --> 06:43.403
so your bill will reflect that.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.668
Hello?

06:47.711 --> 06:49.409
Oh, hey.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.672
Couldn't sleep?No.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.543
Ah, it's hard getting used
to a new place.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.764
And the dull roar of
the CPAP machines doesn't help.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.114
Why are you up so late?

06:59.157 --> 07:00.637
Oh, I've always been

07:03.945 --> 07:06.251

Especially line dancing.

I'm your huckleberry.

07:09.777 --> 07:13.563
They do have a country
music night here.

I'll be long gone by then.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.094
Oh, you're a
short-timer, too?

07:23.138 --> 07:24.792
Yeah.
Soon as they figure out my meds,

07:24.835 --> 07:26.446
I'm out of here. You?

into a guest suite for me.

you don't get along with her.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.021

What is going on?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.729

with my TV on.

through the wall.

How about I take that walking
stick and shove it up your...

Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!

08:51.966 --> 08:55.012
Everybody go back to bed. Peter,

08:55.056 --> 08:56.187
I will bring you
some headphones.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.493
But I...No, no, no, no!

08:57.537 --> 08:59.887
Spencer,
I will get you some earplugs.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.803
Won't work. I have
unusually small earholes.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.022
No, no, no, no! Just go

09:05.066 --> 09:07.024
back to bed!

09:07.068 --> 09:08.635
[exhales]

09:08.678 --> 09:11.812
Hey, Gina. There's a...GINA:
No, no, no, no!

09:11.855 --> 09:13.683
[doors close]

09:15.163 --> 09:16.860
What's going on with your hair?

09:16.904 --> 09:19.167
Oh, I put some gel in it.
Do you like it?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.211
No.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.996
GINA:
Hey.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.519
What are you doing here?Oh, hey.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.826
Well, I was, uh, just
in the neighborhood,

09:25.869 --> 09:28.089
and I thought
maybe we could grab some coffee.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.569
Are you still in your funk?

09:29.612 --> 09:32.093
That's actually progressed
to full-blown freak-out.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.616
Let's go talk.

09:33.660 --> 09:36.227
Stupid. Stupid.
Oh, hey. Hi.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.968
Everything okay?It will be.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.405
Is there a fire?BERT:
Nothing to worry about.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.538
I-I should probably...Yeah, of course.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.279
Go. Go.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.631
Hey, you got a minute?

09:48.675 --> 09:50.981
I could really use
a friend to talk to.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.243
We're friends?

09:52.287 --> 09:54.376
Gabby. Of course we are.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.596
What's my last name?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.120
Okay, talk to you later.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.300
What is going on in here?

10:05.343 --> 10:06.910
Grease fire.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.085
Happens all the time.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.913
Lucky I had this in my car.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.002
Why didn't we have one
in the kitchen?

10:12.046 --> 10:14.265
'Cause I put it in my car.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.746
What? Why would you...
Oh, never mind.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.835
Bert, I-I am sorry.

10:18.879 --> 10:22.143
I gave you a chance, but
the food is still bad.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.972
You're setting fires,
probably 'cause you're drunk.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.800
So...

10:27.801 --> 10:29.193
So what?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.935
I think you know.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.154
I really don't.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.287
You do. You absolutely do.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.594
You're firing me?

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
I'm saying...

10:40.727 --> 10:43.381
regarding
your employment status...

10:44.121 --> 10:45.993
...in this particular job,

10:46.036 --> 10:48.648
that's no more.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.389
So you're firing me.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.913
Your words.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.916
[groans] But not an
inaccurate description of...

10:55.959 --> 10:58.266
your status.

10:58.309 --> 11:01.138
Say it. Say you're firing me.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.358
[crying]:
Oh, Bert, I'm-I'm really...

11:03.401 --> 11:05.708
I'm really sorry
that I have to do this.

11:05.752 --> 11:06.840
Say it.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.102
You're fired!

11:08.145 --> 11:09.494
You're fired!
You're fired! You're fired!

11:09.538 --> 11:10.800
You're fired! You're
fired! You're fired!

11:10.844 --> 11:12.236
You're fired!

11:12.280 --> 11:14.674
Fired! You're fired.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.502
Seriously?

11:17.546 --> 11:18.852
Why?

11:25.032 --> 11:26.337
Oh, this is ridiculous.

11:26.381 --> 11:29.036
Who makes French toast
with rye bread?

11:29.079 --> 11:31.516
Thank God
I'm getting out of this place.JERRY: Oh,

11:31.560 --> 11:32.996
you're moving in with your son?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.998
Yes. I'm going over there
for dinner tonight.

11:35.042 --> 11:38.175
It's a sort of welcome home
celebration for Glam-ma.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.524
Glam-ma?

11:39.568 --> 11:42.310
"Grandma"
for women who are still doable.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.009
Hey, Harry.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.663
Mm.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.751
How's your day going?

11:48.795 --> 11:51.319
Living the dream.DREW:
Mm.

11:51.362 --> 11:54.017
Good for you. 'Cause some days,

11:54.061 --> 11:56.193
it feels like you're drowning
in the ocean,

11:56.237 --> 12:00.371
praying for a boat to come along
and throw you a lifeline. Hmm.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.769
Yeah.
[grunts]

12:06.813 --> 12:09.946
Everybody gets their turn in
the barrel, but when it's you,

12:09.990 --> 12:12.601
all you can hope for
is somebody to talk to.

12:12.644 --> 12:15.909
You know? Somebody who cares.

12:18.085 --> 12:21.392
Yeah, see, for me,
I thought it might be Gina,

12:21.436 --> 12:23.046
but she's got this place
to worry about,

12:23.090 --> 12:26.658
so stick a pin in that donkey,
I guess. [chuckles]

12:27.747 --> 12:29.313
[grunts]

12:29.357 --> 12:31.533
Okay, let me put it
to you this way.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.362
Help me.

12:34.405 --> 12:37.234
Drew, if you're not happy
with your life,

12:37.278 --> 12:39.062
do something about it.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.456
Yeah, see, I just don't know
what that might be.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.066
It doesn't matter.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.807
Just got to stop thinking.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.374
You got to do.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.072
Well, that is food for thought.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.813
Are you not listening?

12:50.857 --> 12:54.425
I just told you,
no thinking. Do.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.775
No, I-I get it.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.126
You're thinking, aren't you?

12:59.169 --> 13:02.085
Oh, yeah. Like a thousand
screaming monkeys in here.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.263
[chair thuds]

13:06.307 --> 13:08.004
What are you doing?

13:08.048 --> 13:10.572
Having breakfast.
Is that a problem?

13:10.615 --> 13:13.183
Move away from me.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.664
Youmove away from me.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.145
Don't make me ask you again.

13:18.188 --> 13:21.104
Oh, does this bother you?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.540
No.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.325
Does this bother you?

13:27.676 --> 13:30.505
What the hell?!

13:30.548 --> 13:34.465
Be prepared, there's more
where that came from!

13:37.904 --> 13:39.819
You okay?

13:40.602 --> 13:42.299
I fired Bert.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.779
You really did it?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.825
Hard to believe, right?

13:45.868 --> 13:49.437
[sighs] Two weeks ago, I was
driving the van and making beds,

13:49.480 --> 13:53.136
and now I'm ruining a man's life
and destroying his family.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.139
The only thing his daughter
is getting for Christmas

13:56.183 --> 13:58.925
is scoliosis.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.405
Okay, that's a little much.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.407
But you do paint a picture.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.150
I was just trying to do
the right thing for everybody.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.587
You did. You're a hero.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.851
You think so?Absolutely.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.852
Thanks.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.636
So, who'd you hire
to replace him?

14:15.419 --> 14:17.508
What?

14:17.552 --> 14:18.901
Lunch is in two hours.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.035
You have 25 senior citizens
expecting to eat.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.386
I didn't think of that.

14:26.126 --> 14:31.044
From hero to zero,
just like that.

14:32.697 --> 14:36.005
Hey! It's Food Court Friday!

14:36.049 --> 14:37.354
Who wants pizza?

14:37.398 --> 14:40.662
Who wants Chinese?Who wants hot dogs on a stick?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.799
Hey. Got a minute
for your P. Daddy?

14:47.843 --> 14:48.670
My what?

14:48.713 --> 14:50.367
Oh, it's a play on P. Diddy.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.499
What is that?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.457
Never mind.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.546
Homework?Yeah.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.202
Never fun. And it's, like,
every day. [chuckles]

14:59.246 --> 15:00.377
Yeah.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.857
Hey, uh, did you hear

15:01.901 --> 15:03.206
Pink changed her hair
to blue?

15:03.250 --> 15:06.166
What's next, Taylor Swift
becomes Taylor Slow?

15:06.209 --> 15:07.384
What do you want, Dad?

15:07.428 --> 15:09.560
[chuckles]
Yeah, busted. Okay.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.607
Look, I am here
on a mission.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.349
How would you feel
about taking

15:15.392 --> 15:19.657
a father-daughter road trip
across our great land?

15:19.701 --> 15:21.746
A road trip?Yeah.

15:21.790 --> 15:22.965
Think of all the stuff
we'll see.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.793
Majestic mountains,
raging rivers,

15:24.836 --> 15:26.926
giant balls of twine.
[chuckles]

15:26.969 --> 15:28.188
Pass.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.580
Come on. It'll be fun.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.668
[Australian accent]:
Crikey, mate,

15:30.712 --> 15:32.627
we're going on an adventure.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.977
Are you dying again?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.501
[normal voice]: No. No,
I have a clean bill of health.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.590
I just want
to take advantage of it.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.331
What happened with you and Gina?

15:41.375 --> 15:42.811
I thought you were going for it.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.856
Maybe down the road.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.511
Right now,
she's focusing on work,

15:47.555 --> 15:51.428
and I am focusing
all my attention on you.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.953
Boop.
[chuckles]

15:54.779 --> 15:57.173
So, what do you say?

15:57.217 --> 15:58.783
Let's hit the road.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.524
You know,
I've been to a lot of places,

16:00.568 --> 16:02.787
but I've never been to me.

16:02.831 --> 16:06.095
Look, Dad, when you got sick,
I worried about you

16:06.139 --> 16:07.531
all the time.

16:07.575 --> 16:11.100
But now you're better, so...

16:11.144 --> 16:14.103
So you want to go back
to being a regular teenager

16:14.147 --> 16:15.844
who doesn't have time
for her father?

16:15.887 --> 16:17.150
That would be so great.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.069
Hello, fellow night owl.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.984
Hi, Jerry.

16:25.767 --> 16:29.031
So, uh, what you drinking?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.119
Vodka.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.339
And?Vodka.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.210
Not fooling around.No.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.821
I'm guessing things
didn't go well with your son.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.128
He said he had to choose
his marriage over me.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.001
Wives and mothers.
It's a tricky dance.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.132
I let him live in my body,

16:43.176 --> 16:45.004
he can't let me live
in his basement?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.137
Well, I'm sure
he still loves you.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.573
I know.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.488
That's why I'm gonna make
Christmas a living hell

16:51.532 --> 16:53.055
for all of them.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.538
Well, not to be selfish,

16:57.581 --> 16:59.670
but I'm glad
you're not leaving.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.716
I'd miss you.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.284
That's very sweet.

17:05.285 --> 17:08.549
If you're going to try to kiss
me, this is not the right time.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.029
Oh, no, I wasn't.I'm not saying

17:10.072 --> 17:12.509
I'm not interested. It's
just not the right time.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.250
I promise you

17:14.294 --> 17:15.947
I wasn't thinking that.

17:15.991 --> 17:19.821
Oh, Jerry, your nose isn't
the only thing that's growing.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.218
I told you,
I don't have it.

17:25.261 --> 17:28.482
So my remote just
sprouted legs

17:28.525 --> 17:30.527
and walked out of my room?Hey,

17:30.571 --> 17:32.312
I was a cop. I don't steal.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.967
Although there's no law
against hiding stuff.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.622
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

17:38.666 --> 17:41.495
Hello? Thank you.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.192
It is my pleasure to announce

17:43.236 --> 17:46.108
that we have filled
the chef position.

17:46.152 --> 17:49.068
All right!Good for you.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.939
Hello.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.116
It's the same idiot.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.902
How senile
do you think we are?

17:57.946 --> 18:01.123
Harry, throw your shoe at him.GINA:Hold on.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.472
Hold on.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.866
As you all know,
I bought this place

18:04.909 --> 18:06.520
to make
everybody's lives better,

18:06.563 --> 18:09.566
but what you don't know is

18:09.610 --> 18:11.873
that includes the staff.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.918
Nobody's getting fired.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.791
This is absurd. The man's
cooking's an abomination!

18:16.834 --> 18:19.098
Kills me to say so,
but Peter's right.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.925
Why, thank you, Spencer.[grunts]

18:20.969 --> 18:23.537
And your remote's in a baggie
in your toilet tank.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.409
[chuckles]:
Oh, very clever.

18:26.453 --> 18:29.412
Bert, why don't you tell them
what you just told me.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.067
Oh, that if it meant not
getting fired, I would suck...

18:32.111 --> 18:33.677
No.

18:33.721 --> 18:34.983
[Gina chuckles]

18:35.897 --> 18:36.941
The other thing.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.595
Oh, right. I
pledged to Gina

18:38.639 --> 18:41.424
that there will be no
more drinking on the job.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.818
Or?LSD.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.341
GINA:
Continue.

18:45.385 --> 18:49.302
Ramon the dishwasher
will no longer cook lunch

18:49.345 --> 18:52.435
while I bang my girlfriend
in one of your rooms.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.831
I thought you were married.Sometimes. It's complicated.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.095
But most important, I
really do love my job,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.663
and I'm asking you all
for another chance.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.621
Whose room did you use?

19:04.665 --> 19:07.363
We switch it up. You
know, keep it fresh.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.409
GINA:
So,

19:09.452 --> 19:11.324
what do you say?

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
Oh.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.153
Just-just go.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.720
Cook something. They're hangry.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.814
Okay, I got one more,
and it's a good one.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.468
Mm-hmm.Know what they called

19:25.512 --> 19:28.645
Post Malone
before he became a rapper?No.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.865
Pre Malone.
[chuckles]

19:30.908 --> 19:33.346
This is why
I don't invite friends over.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.134
[engine turns off]

19:41.745 --> 19:44.226
[car doors close]

19:49.188 --> 19:51.320
What's with the sign?

19:51.364 --> 19:55.368
Well, I decided to stop thinking
and just do.
