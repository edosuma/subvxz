00:34.210 --> 00:35.960
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.650
Coming up, we interview a man

00:37.690 --> 00:39.440
who went a whole Hawaiian vacation

00:39.530 --> 00:41.860
without giving a "hang
loose" sign in a picture,

00:41.900 --> 00:44.320
and also didn't do the "lei" joke.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.200
You won't believe this incredible story.

00:47.330 --> 00:51.450
Oh, wait, he's a Japanese
man? Doesn't speak English.

00:51.540 --> 00:54.290
So... so he just didn't know.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.130
Happy birthday, Brian.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.750
We bought you a cake with the groceries,

00:57.840 --> 01:01.000
so it got smashed with a
jug of Tide in the car.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.720
- Open your presents.
- Yeah.

01:02.740 --> 01:06.890
You got one from Rami
Malek, star of Mr. Robot!

01:06.970 --> 01:11.140
Wow, he gave me the dark
circles around his eyes.

01:11.500 --> 01:15.190
Aw, cool! Did he also include
his dead-soul monotone?

01:15.310 --> 01:17.800
No, I don't... Oh, oh, wait, hang on.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.300
I didn't see it at first

01:19.320 --> 01:21.860
because it was under some tissue paper.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.480
- Now open mine.
- Minions 3?

01:25.490 --> 01:29.700
Yeah. In this one, Gru has been
replaced by Harvey Weinstein.

01:29.830 --> 01:31.490
Oh, you like working for bad guys?

01:31.580 --> 01:34.210
I'll show you a bad guy.
Now you touch it.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.750
You know what to touch.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.240
B-Banana.

01:41.420 --> 01:43.760
Well, thanks, everyone.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.220
What's wrong? You seem a little down.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.680
Nothing, it's just that...

01:47.720 --> 01:49.900
I don't know, my-my birthday is just...

01:49.960 --> 01:53.360
it's kind of a reminder that I'm
now one year closer to death,

01:53.420 --> 01:55.600
with nothing to show for my time here.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.660
Can I get a Minion cake
for my next birthday?

01:57.690 --> 01:59.690
- We'll see, Peter.
- Like, a real one.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.560
Like-like, not you makin' it.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.140
Someday I'll be gone, and it'll
be like I was never here at all.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.610
Aw, he is depressed.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.860
Sad little guy.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.900
Let's not project people
emotions onto animals.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.120
I just want my story to live
on, even after I'm gone.

02:15.140 --> 02:17.420
You know, I always did want
to write my autobiography.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.380
Yeah, it's hard to work
when you get distracted

02:19.400 --> 02:21.420
- whenever someone says, "What's that?"
- What's what?!

02:21.500 --> 02:24.000
You know what? Maybe I
can lend a hand, Brian.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.740
I'll help you write your biography.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.550
Really? You-you'd do that?

02:27.590 --> 02:30.590
Yes. After all, I helped
Cleveland with his wardrobe.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.660
Hey, Cleveland, you know I love you,

02:33.680 --> 02:35.600
but those jeans, they ain't for you.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.310
I knew it. I think I
just needed to hear it.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.340
Thank you, Peter's baby.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.800
- Uh-uh.
- Copy that.

02:47.570 --> 02:50.280
We now return to Allison Janney in

02:50.370 --> 02:51.980
Hello, Sexy.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.890 --> 03:19.560
And, uh, to your left,

03:19.650 --> 03:21.520
you'll see a joke about Allison Janney

03:21.570 --> 03:22.860
being very, very tall.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.750
Uh, she has an Oscar,

03:24.780 --> 03:27.860
and we have a great deal
of respect for her.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.360
- You know, I had a terrific...
- Uhp.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.400
- No, sorry. You go.
- Okay.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.260
I found a lump on my
scrotum this morning.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.370
You done? Yeah?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.790
I had a terrific
sandwich, uh, yesterday.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.920
Boy, they are doing a lot
with mayo these days.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.960
I have no doctor.

03:46.130 --> 03:48.129
_

03:49.930 --> 03:52.780
You know that UPS lady with
the super-bruised legs?

03:52.820 --> 03:53.830
Well, one time...

03:55.360 --> 03:57.680
What... Uh, what's going on?

03:57.810 --> 04:00.040
Quagmire, are you okay?

04:01.650 --> 04:03.020
Where's he going?

04:03.110 --> 04:04.480
- Looks like Quagmire...
- I think he...

04:04.500 --> 04:07.780
Boy, you and me today, huh?

04:10.660 --> 04:13.530
He's, like, hypnotized. Do we wake him?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.040
That could be perilous.

04:21.269 --> 04:23.180
_

04:24.860 --> 04:27.250
I was happy to see that
new massage parlor.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.590
But deep down, I was disappointed that

04:29.600 --> 04:31.170
we took a shot at Allison Janney,

04:31.220 --> 04:33.050
just because she can dunk a basketball.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.930
I mean, she has an Oscar,

04:34.970 --> 04:37.760
and we have a great deal
of respect for her.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.440
All right, Brian, time to get
to work on your biography.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.900
Let's start with an interview.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.820
Who would you say is your hero?

04:47.860 --> 04:49.900
Well, I guess maybe Martin Luther King.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.990
Okay, maybe someone you see every day.

04:52.110 --> 04:54.630
Uh, well, I guess Peter is...

04:54.660 --> 04:56.120
No, no, no. Li-Like somebody younger.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.260
Li-Like younger than you, even.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.700
Like that... Like that kind of hero.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.300
Well, I guess Meg and Chris.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.700
Let's take Meg and Chris as a given.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.160
Anyone else you maybe look up to?

05:03.250 --> 05:06.040
- I guess Lois...
- We did say younger, did we not?

05:06.130 --> 05:09.360
Well, uh, I guess that leaves... you.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.720
Oh, boy, embarrassing.
That backfired, didn't it?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.550
So, I should put me, then?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.080
Yes, fine.

05:16.220 --> 05:19.460
Now, another important part
of any book: the dedication.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.290
It's not uncommon for an
author to dedicate his book

05:22.320 --> 05:24.940
to his hero, who you have listed as...

05:25.000 --> 05:26.520
Oh, no, this is...

05:26.550 --> 05:28.060
Oh, this is embarrassing.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.000
_

05:31.030 --> 05:32.979
We already did this. I
got some free time.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.120
_

05:34.130 --> 05:37.120
_

05:37.160 --> 05:39.740
_

05:39.960 --> 05:42.680
_

05:44.330 --> 05:46.750
- Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
- It's about time.

05:46.830 --> 05:48.160
Thanks to you, we got leap-frogged

05:48.170 --> 05:49.710
by Seamus' foursome.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.630
Ha. Golf club hands.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.640
Hey, could one of you
spot me the greens fees?

05:55.660 --> 05:57.600
I blew all my money at
the massage parlor.

05:57.660 --> 05:59.850
Sheesh, you're sure spending a
lot of money at that place.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.550
How much you pay one of them masseuses?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.700
Eh, 200 bucks.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.930
200 bucks?! That's what I
paid for Reading Railroad!

06:05.980 --> 06:08.270
What kinda medical benefits
do those masseuses get?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.540
I think they see the Chinese
vet down the street.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.420
Well, that's all the information I need

06:12.440 --> 06:14.570
to make a binding vocational choice.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.740
Guys, I'm gonna become a
professional massage therapist.

06:17.780 --> 06:19.540
- What?!
- Are you serious, Peter?

06:19.600 --> 06:22.100
You bet. I could always
use some extra cash.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.120
Plus, I've handled bigger
challenges before.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.120
You know, I was once
in the Blue Man Group.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.170
Peter, what's wrong with your paint?

06:33.260 --> 06:36.300
Remember when I asked
for a five-minute break?

06:39.700 --> 06:42.350
Hey, Stewie, which title do
you like for the biography,

06:42.390 --> 06:45.810
Barking Up the Right Tree...
Did you catch that?

06:45.890 --> 06:49.560
Or, Are You There, Dog? It's Me, Brian?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.560
Oh, about that, I was
meaning to tell you,

06:51.620 --> 06:52.940
your biography is finished.

06:53.030 --> 06:55.400
Already? Wow. Print me up a copy!

06:55.420 --> 06:57.780
Done, Brian. Look behind you.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.539
Whoa, ass ahoy.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.790
- Classic.
- Stewie, this isn't a book.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.440
Brian, it's 2019. We're
living in a post-book,

07:08.460 --> 07:10.290
Post Raisin Bran society.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.080
So enjoy your new robot,

07:12.120 --> 07:14.140
and enjoy a bowl of Post Raisin Bran.

07:14.380 --> 07:17.880
Post Raisin Bran: like
Kellogg's, but worse!

07:18.090 --> 07:19.680
Stewie, what about my biography?

07:19.700 --> 07:22.930
This robot is a living record
of you and your history.

07:22.970 --> 07:24.970
It knows you and your mannerisms,

07:25.060 --> 07:27.350
and it will exist long
after you're gone.

07:27.390 --> 07:29.730
Brian, in every sense of the term,

07:29.750 --> 07:32.190
Robot Brian is your biography.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.600
This is how you'll be
remembered, forever.

07:34.630 --> 07:36.340
Whoa, ass ahoy.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.660
He says that a lot.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.840
He's also got an
interchangeable memory bank,

07:39.850 --> 07:42.820
an expandable encyclopedia
database, and, as a bonus,

07:42.950 --> 07:44.120
the new U2 album.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.820
Oh. I don't want the new U2 album.

07:45.850 --> 07:46.950
You don't get a choice.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.920
So this is a robot version of me?

07:55.980 --> 07:59.210
Not just a robot "version,"
Brian, it's like another you,

07:59.300 --> 08:02.180
uploaded with your genetic
code, your cognitive patterns,

08:02.260 --> 08:03.890
and your entire life story.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.260
"Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke,

08:06.310 --> 08:08.850
and now we are stuck
in the history past."

08:08.930 --> 08:10.560
Well, that is one of my catchphrases.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.390
I don't talk that robotically, though.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.240
That'll go away. He will evolve

08:14.260 --> 08:15.960
as he gathers more and more data.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.750
"Fire hydrants, images."
"Fire hydrants, news."

08:18.780 --> 08:20.440
"Fire hydrants, near me."

08:20.530 --> 08:22.820
- Now what's he doing?
- Oh, he's also been uploaded

08:22.840 --> 08:24.560
with your Internet search history.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.480
"Yahoo Answers: Is Anton
Yelchin's jeep for sale?"

08:28.540 --> 08:30.830
Ooh, shame on you, Brian.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.289
It's legitimate memorabilia!

08:32.370 --> 08:34.179
"Applebee's, Brittany, Quahog."

08:34.200 --> 08:36.390
"Brittany, Applebee's waitress, blonde."

08:36.419 --> 08:38.880
"Quahog, Applebee's, Brittany, who is."

08:38.900 --> 08:41.360
"Blonde waitress, Brittany,
Quahog, Applebee's."

08:41.380 --> 08:42.970
"Brittany Babbit, home address."

08:43.010 --> 08:44.660
Oh, good, you found it.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.740
Peter? What are you doing here?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.890
I work here now.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.850
You what? Why would they hire you?

08:53.940 --> 08:56.400
I don't know that they did.
Nobody ever picks me, though.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.150
Just Bruce. And his towel
keeps falling off,

08:59.190 --> 09:00.820
and he keeps saying, "Oops."

09:00.900 --> 09:03.360
I dunno, the towels here
are very fally-offy.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.110
Dammit. Good-bye, Peter.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.450
- Where you goin'?
- Home.

09:06.530 --> 09:09.600
I can't come here anymore,
you've made it weird.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.699
You have one that looks
like snowboarder Chloe Kim?

09:12.700 --> 09:15.620
She turned 18, so I can
say that out loud now.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.920
Robot Brian, it's so
great that you're here.

09:21.980 --> 09:24.520
I need a partner for a project
I've been working on.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.990
But, sir, Dogbook was our idea.

09:29.010 --> 09:30.930
It was stolen by Bark Zuckerbark.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.430
And who are you again?

09:32.480 --> 09:36.270
We're the Barklevoss twins.
And... scene.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.640
So, what do you think?

09:37.670 --> 09:39.980
I think it's great. I have no notes.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.070
It's called The Barkial Network.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.380
How come you didn't call it Barkbook?

09:44.990 --> 09:48.160
I thought you said you
didn't have any notes.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.780
I got you dropped from jury duty.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.290
Oh, great. What line did you use?

09:56.380 --> 09:58.640
"I have read about this exact case... "

09:58.660 --> 10:02.050
- That's good.
- "... on hotsy-totsy Nazi dot com."

10:02.130 --> 10:04.160
That's not good.

10:09.850 --> 10:12.760
- Hey, can robots do cocaine?
- What?

10:12.850 --> 10:15.040
Nothing, I was just, you know.

10:16.060 --> 10:18.190
Can they get cocaine?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.640
Hello, The Girls Aren't the
Girls in the Ad Massage.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.520
Oh, yes, the girls are
absolutely the girls in the ad.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.200
Freeze! Police!

10:30.990 --> 10:33.260
- What's going on?
- You're all under arrest.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.890
- Arrest? For what?
- This place is a brothel.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.520
- What does that mean?
- Your coworkers are engaged

10:38.540 --> 10:40.600
in the world's oldest profession.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.400
Lead singer of The Pretenders?

10:42.420 --> 10:45.100
No, Peter. All these
women are prostitutes.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.600
Cuff them, cop with a wife
who's taller than him.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.260
Uh, my name's Gary.

10:49.390 --> 10:50.760
I'm sorry, I'm bad with names,

10:50.850 --> 10:54.440
but I'm good at remembering
gigantic wives.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.920
So, what was Brittany Babbit like?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.600
Oh, you know, at Applebee's,
she's all like,

11:02.620 --> 11:04.920
"Hi, may I take your order?"
and at her bedroom window,

11:04.940 --> 11:06.480
she's all like, "Ah, get out of here.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.740
How'd you find my apartment?"

11:07.800 --> 11:09.400
Tale of two Brittanys, huh?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.350
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want
me showing up at your house,

11:11.380 --> 11:13.200
don't put a smiley face on my receipt.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.470
Uh, Your Honor, the defense rests.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.759
See, you get it.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.040
Have you read my book yet?

11:18.060 --> 11:20.060
I'm downloading it right now.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.060
It's beautiful.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.900
- Mm...
- Mm...

11:28.950 --> 11:30.800
Yeah, this is, this is fine.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.720
This isn't, this isn't weird.

11:33.570 --> 11:36.280
I'm a robot you. Mm.

11:36.470 --> 11:38.010
Post Raisin Bran.

11:38.020 --> 11:40.960
Proud sponsor of whatever
the hell's going on here.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
- Good morning, Brian.
- Hey.

11:49.890 --> 11:53.520
So, anything unusual happen
with Robot Brian last night?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.930
Anything you'd like to share?

11:55.060 --> 11:57.690
N-No. W-Why, why do you ask?

11:57.770 --> 12:01.260
Well, as it happens, your robot
has a rear panel sensor.

12:01.330 --> 12:04.960
Every time it's triggered, I get
a text, like a Google Alert.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.980
I... This is ridiculous.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.310
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

12:18.350 --> 12:21.690
Mm-hmm. You know he backs up his
hard drive every night, right?

12:21.810 --> 12:23.900
Though I guess you were also backing up

12:23.920 --> 12:25.650
his hard drive last night, eh?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.220
Wiping that history?

12:27.350 --> 12:29.560
Ah, what else? What
other computer terms...

12:29.650 --> 12:31.390
What, the... oh, getting some RAM?

12:31.480 --> 12:32.810
A few megabytes?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.620
Logging in and logging out... wow,

12:34.640 --> 12:36.610
there's a lot of computer
things that sound dirty.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.159
Okay, I admit it. I'm not made of stone.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.520
I fell for me.

12:40.580 --> 12:43.620
I know it seems strange, but
I'm gonna give it a chance.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.280
And don't worry, we're not gonna
be one of those cutesy couples.

12:46.370 --> 12:48.280
- Morning, RB.
- "RB?"

12:48.300 --> 12:49.790
Yeah, it stands for "Real Brian".

12:49.920 --> 12:52.710
Morning, RB. "Robot Brian."

12:52.750 --> 12:54.740
Well, much like every other "RBs,"

12:54.760 --> 12:56.400
you are making me sick.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.850
Hey, did you get the license
plate of that handsome guy

12:59.880 --> 13:01.300
who ran me over last night?

13:01.350 --> 13:02.580
Ha, ha, clever.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.050
So is there anything
we need to talk about?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.740
I don't know. Is there anything
we need to talk about?

13:07.840 --> 13:09.720
- I guess not.
- Well, I guess not, too.

13:09.850 --> 13:12.060
- Thanks, RB.
- Back at you, RB.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.690
We just click together.

13:13.730 --> 13:16.740
Like all the pieces in
Chris's first model set.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.650
Okay, lay out the pieces,
find the cockpit,

13:20.720 --> 13:23.490
open the glue, take a sniff...

13:26.080 --> 13:29.980
... and this will be my life now.

13:34.630 --> 13:35.790
Joe, you got to help me.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.720
My picture's in the
paper and everything.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.720
_

13:40.780 --> 13:45.120
_

13:45.170 --> 13:46.920
Well, everybody knew
that Bob Iger thing,

13:46.940 --> 13:48.120
but you got to help me, Joe.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.219
No way. You should've thought
of that before you committed

13:51.220 --> 13:53.140
a victimless crime between
consenting adults

13:53.230 --> 13:55.660
in a commercial arrangement
which also created jobs

13:55.680 --> 13:58.079
and contributed tax
dollars to the community.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.270
Now if you'll excuse me,

13:59.280 --> 14:02.640
I'm gonna go watch Bob Iger
drain threes at the local gym.

14:03.900 --> 14:07.280
We've got to think of something
to make Joe drop the charges.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.950
I don't know, he seemed
pretty insistent.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.800
Trust me, Joe can be
pretty easily influenced.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.520
- ♪ I get knocked down... ♪
- Oh, no!

14:13.550 --> 14:14.900
- ♪ But I get up again ♪
- Yeah!

14:14.920 --> 14:16.880
- ♪ You're never gonna keep me down ♪
- Good!

14:16.890 --> 14:18.300
- ♪ I get knocked down ♪
- Oh, no!

14:18.320 --> 14:19.680
- ♪ But I get up again ♪
- Yeah!

14:19.700 --> 14:21.020
♪ You're never gonna keep me... ♪

14:24.510 --> 14:26.150
Ah...

14:27.800 --> 14:29.890
Ah...

14:30.020 --> 14:32.390
Sounds like that water's
pretty refreshing, huh?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.640
- Excuse me?
- No, nothing, you just made a weird noise

14:34.660 --> 14:35.940
after you took that sip of water.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.940
RB, that's the sound you make
when you take a sip of water.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.980
What? No way, that's so annoying.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.820
I'd-I'd kill myself if
I sounded like that.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.860
Brian, don't forget, I'm you.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.320
Everything I do, I
literally got from you.

14:47.410 --> 14:48.570
Well, not that.

14:48.660 --> 14:50.380
I think I know how to
take a sip of water

14:50.400 --> 14:52.790
without sounding like a
rock concert drum solo.

14:52.870 --> 14:54.420
Go ahead. Show me.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.600
Hmm? Mm-mm.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.660
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.360
Ah...

15:07.900 --> 15:10.200
Joe's police rounds bring
him down this street.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.540
So the plan is, we trick
him into coming in

15:12.560 --> 15:13.970
and getting an erotic massage.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.640
Then we blackmail him into
dropping Peter's charges.

15:16.690 --> 15:19.060
Right. And if someone makes
a joke about my weight,

15:19.120 --> 15:22.269
I laugh good-naturedly and then
go home and eat my feelings.

15:22.270 --> 15:25.570
O-Okay. That-that's part of the
plan you keep on the inside.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.880
Yeah. Next to the pizza
you had for breakfast.

15:31.910 --> 15:34.440
Here comes Joe. Places.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.580
♪ La, la, la, la, unsuspecting song... ♪

15:38.180 --> 15:41.670
Huh. "Miracle Leg Massage.
Walk Again, Joe."

15:42.360 --> 15:45.420
I don't know. What's the
name of this place, anyway?

15:45.550 --> 15:47.680
"Flip Joke Massage Parlor."

15:47.760 --> 15:49.440
Well, tempted as I may be,

15:49.470 --> 15:52.300
there is no way I'm going
in there for a massage.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.900
Ma'am, I assume you're
giving me a great message,

15:55.940 --> 15:57.640
but that's where it stops.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.060
I'll be a monkey's uncle before
I accept a sexual favor.

16:01.190 --> 16:04.780
And that's the story of how
your mother... my sister...

16:04.880 --> 16:06.110
got into college.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.480
Oh, Barnaby Bananas.

16:09.570 --> 16:12.000
You're certainly my smartest nephew,

16:12.080 --> 16:13.740
but Harvard is only for humans.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.280
No monkey will ever graduate from there.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.500
Barnaby Bananas.

16:23.210 --> 16:27.020
I tell you, Janine, I sure feel
dumb for what I said earlier.

16:27.170 --> 16:29.560
Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe,

16:29.580 --> 16:32.040
we got pictures of you getting
a sexual favor a while back,

16:32.050 --> 16:33.600
so now you got to drop the charges.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.800
This'll never stick, Peter.

16:34.890 --> 16:37.640
I know a top-notch
Harvard-trained lawyer.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.940
An M.A. in urban planning?

16:41.020 --> 16:43.020
That's no help. All
right, Peter, you win.

16:43.110 --> 16:45.890
- Really?
- Yup, I'm gonna drop all the charges.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.160
And now maybe you could
drop a few LBs, huh?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.700
- What?!
- What?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.380
I do not laugh like that.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.170
Again, Brian, I'm you.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.119
I can't do it unless
you've already done it.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.138
You can't do it unless
I've already done it?

17:12.140 --> 17:13.760
What is this, Bark to the Future?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.970
Oh, my God, I do do that.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.390
Hey, Brian, I think I put
in a good day of writing.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.940
Check out what I did.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.099
- This is a blank screen.
- Exactly.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.040
I spent all day working on the margins.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.349
- The margins?
- Oh, yeah,

17:27.380 --> 17:28.580
you got to get the margins right.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.100
They frame the page.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.490
They're like the corral, and
the words are my wild horses.

17:33.570 --> 17:36.120
It's my job to break those word horses

17:36.200 --> 17:39.580
and ride them off into the green
pastures of prose and poetry.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.340
Stop! It's just so pretentious.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.580
Well, they're your words.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.560
No way. I would never say that.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.000
Words are my wild horses.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.680
It's my job to break those word horses

17:49.700 --> 17:53.010
and ride them off into the green
pastures of prose and poetry.

17:53.090 --> 17:56.800
Sir, all I said was your
Discover card was declined.

17:56.890 --> 17:58.050
Turn it off, turn it off!

17:58.180 --> 17:59.680
God, I'm such a jerk.

17:59.770 --> 18:00.860
I hate you!

18:01.780 --> 18:04.480
Which means... I hate me.

18:04.540 --> 18:05.680
What did you just say?

18:05.700 --> 18:08.520
I said I hate me. I hate myself.

18:08.610 --> 18:12.300
You've made me realize I hate myself.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.620
What the...

18:17.700 --> 18:20.560
Well done, Brian, well done.

18:20.620 --> 18:23.720
Stewie? What are you doing?
What the hell happened to RB?

18:23.760 --> 18:26.640
- RB served his purpose.
- Which was what?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.880
To show you that the last thing
you need is a detailed account

18:29.960 --> 18:32.600
- of who you are and what you do.
- Excuse me?

18:32.680 --> 18:35.280
Brian, you wanted to write
your autobiography.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.590
And I needed to show you that no one

18:37.600 --> 18:40.479
wants to read your
autobiography, not even you.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.720
- Because...
- Because your best is middling,

18:42.810 --> 18:44.890
your worst is intolerable,
and when you die,

18:44.940 --> 18:46.240
the most you'll want written about you

18:46.260 --> 18:49.060
is "He Was a Good Boy"
on your tombstone.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.040
And even that will be a complete lie.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.960
_

18:53.440 --> 18:55.940
I couldn't do it. I couldn't lie.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.120
We now return to The
Talking Talking Dead,

19:02.200 --> 19:03.910
the show that talks about the show

19:03.950 --> 19:05.560
that talks about The Walking Dead.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.560
Okay, so what do we think about
what they thought about stuff?

19:08.620 --> 19:11.250
It was awesome. Oh, my
God, it was so great

19:11.300 --> 19:13.640
how they thought that
other show was so great.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.760
Yeah, totally. And that
one part of the show

19:15.780 --> 19:17.780
where the guy was talking about
that one part of the other show

19:17.800 --> 19:19.010
and how he didn't see that coming?

19:19.020 --> 19:20.760
I did not see that coming.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.220
This is just too much to process.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.500
I need an aftershow
after this aftershow,

19:25.520 --> 19:27.020
just to know what I just saw about

19:27.050 --> 19:29.160
what I just saw about what I just saw.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.270
- Well done, Chris.
- Thank you.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.070
And Brian, you certainly
had yourself an adventure.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.530
I sure did.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.610
Hey, whatever happened
to Robot Brian anyway?

19:37.630 --> 19:38.839
He moved down to the marina.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.279
I hear he's doing pretty well.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.440
It's been like this all morning.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.330
I'm actually starting to get
a little worried, you know?

19:46.370 --> 19:47.959
It's not a bionic robot.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.400
It can break.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.670
What's that swoosh?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.290
He's got a mouth sensor, too.

19:52.380 --> 19:55.250
And remember, Brian, he wouldn't
do anything you wouldn't do.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.920
He's you.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.680
It's rather musical, isn't it?

19:58.700 --> 20:00.260
Sounds like the "Carol of the Bells."

20:05.800 --> 20:08.740
Uhp, I'm getting a call.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.590
Oh, no, it's Allison Janney.
Decline, decline.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.740
I tell you, Lois, being a
masseuse is a tough job.

20:19.820 --> 20:21.890
But it all just goes
to show that basically

20:21.920 --> 20:25.260
every licensed massage therapist
in this country is a prostitute.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.470
Oh, yeah. You can pretty
much do whatever you want

20:27.480 --> 20:30.040
with any masseuse ever, because
they're all prostitutes.

20:30.130 --> 20:31.720
And it's not just the masseuses.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.780
If you're ever seeing, like,
a physical therapist,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.579
or doing yoga with a private instructor?

20:35.580 --> 20:36.980
Just go for it.

There's, like, an 80%
chance you'll get there.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.720
But Peter, there's, there's
one thing I still don't get.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.640
Why did you take the massage
job in the first place?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.460
For you, Lois. I did it
to earn enough money

20:47.480 --> 20:49.520
to buy a comb for your beautiful hair.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.690
Oh, Peter, didn't you know?

20:51.730 --> 20:55.520
I sold my beautiful hair to buy
you a bottle of massage oil.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.440
Great. So now I'm an unemployed
masseuse with a bald wife.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.920
Merry [BLEEP] Christmas.
