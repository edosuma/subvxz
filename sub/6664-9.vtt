00:01.534 --> 00:02.401
Adult adam:
<i> Cindy crawford,</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:04.303
<i> Kathy ireland,</i>
<i> claudia schiffer.</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:05.938
<i> The '80s gave birth</i>
<i> to the supermodel.</i>

00:05.940 --> 00:09.641
<i> They had everything...</i>
<i> The hair, the bodies,</i>
<i> the cheekbones.</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:11.443
<i> A supermodel</i>
<i> had to be perfect,</i>

00:11.445 --> 00:14.246
<i> But my brother was about</i>
<i> to prove that wrong.</i>

00:14.248 --> 00:18.617
Gentlemen, it appears
my holiday shopping is done.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.585
Jealous?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.053
Dude!
Butt mug.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.188
Now you can drink hot cocoa
out of a butt

00:23.190 --> 00:24.156
'cause it's a mug
with a butt.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.959
Better get moving 'cause
they only got a couple left.

00:26.961 --> 00:30.162
Oh, my mom
is going to love that.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.196
Sweet butt mug, bro.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.798
Sure is.
Have we met before?

00:32.800 --> 00:36.268
Perhaps at the gucci show
in milan, Italy?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.936
Mmm, no.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.071
Oh, sorry.

00:39.073 --> 00:39.905
Where do you model?

00:39.907 --> 00:42.041
Where do I what?
Model.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.344
I mean, clearly someone
with your symmetrical face,

00:45.346 --> 00:47.713
Perfect bone structure,
and jazzy hair

00:47.715 --> 00:49.548
Is already working
the circuit, right?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.617
You know, that hadn't
occurred to me yet,

00:51.619 --> 00:52.785
But it makes
total sense.

00:52.787 --> 00:54.053
Then today's
my lucky day.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.955
I'm john calabasas.
I'm a talent scout.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.290
Do you have
representation?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.826
Whoa. Hold up.
Are you for real?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.127
I'm just a dude
at a mall.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.930
Iman was discovered
at a stop'n go,

01:04.932 --> 01:06.832
Kathy ireland
at a sizzler,

01:06.834 --> 01:08.567
Cindy crawford
in a corn maze.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.036
Supermodels
get discovered everywhere.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.938
Supermodel?
Me?

01:12.940 --> 01:14.606
You remind me
of claudia schaffer

01:14.608 --> 01:16.008
Before she worked
with me.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.943
Claudia schaffer worked
with you?

01:17.945 --> 01:21.213
People like me, yes.
And you can, too.

01:21.215 --> 01:25.284
Adult adam: <i> Yeah,</i>
<i> this really happened</i>
<i> all the time back in the '80s.</i>

01:25.286 --> 01:26.351
Yeah.
(camera shutter clicking)

01:26.353 --> 01:28.120
<i> Scam artists</i>
<i> would target naive dreamers</i>

01:28.122 --> 01:31.123
<i> And promise them super stardom</i>
<i> for a low fee.</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:33.258
You are
blowing me away.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.662
<i> And my brother</i>
<i> was as naive as they came.</i>

01:36.664 --> 01:37.262
Big news, everyone!

01:37.264 --> 01:40.432
I've been personally
selected to be
a world-famous model.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.836
Well, I think you're limiting
yourself at world-famous,

01:43.838 --> 01:44.403
But continue.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.939
I was approached by
a modeling scout
in the mall.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.609
He had a brochure
and an official
business card.

01:50.611 --> 01:55.214
"john calabasas,
professional model finder."

01:55.216 --> 01:56.248
Good. He's legit.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.616
All I have to do
is give him $100,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.218
Take some classes,
and soon, I'll be making

01:59.220 --> 02:02.754
Upwards of $10,000 a day
being a supermodel.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.022
You're a super moron.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.825
Mom's never
gonna throw away $100.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.826
I made it out to cash.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.760
When did you
even write that?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.163
Oh, my god.
I've been saying it
for years

02:11.165 --> 02:13.699
And now it's finally
been confirmed.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.800
My little monkey

02:14.802 --> 02:18.370
Is the most handsome boy
on the planet.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.404
Yeah.
(laughs)

02:19.406 --> 02:22.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands off the money-maker.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.777
Now, if you excuse me,
I need to get some
beauty rest.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.379
Wake me in 14 hours.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.046
Wait. (chuckles)

02:28.048 --> 02:30.782
Why don't you put some
cucumbers on your eyes

02:30.784 --> 02:32.117
Like the models do?

02:32.119 --> 02:33.952
Ah, oh, yeah.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.787
I feel it
burning already.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.356
Burning?
Aah!

02:37.358 --> 02:39.391
It burns so much!
Oh, no.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.359
I already dressed
the salad.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.560
It's lemon pepper
vinaigrette.

02:41.562 --> 02:45.264
Ah, ah, my eyes,
my beautiful deep
brown eyes! Help me!

02:45.266 --> 02:48.734
Oh.
Come on. Be brave.
Be brave.

02:49.002 --> 02:49.801
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:49.803 --> 02:54.840
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:55.909 --> 02:57.109
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:57.111 --> 03:00.979
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:00.981 --> 03:03.649
Adult adam:
<i> It was December 28,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:03.651 --> 03:05.918
<i> And I was gearing up</i>
<i> to get my</i> et <i> on.</i>

03:05.920 --> 03:07.186
<i> Back then,</i>
<i> people loved it so much,</i>

03:07.188 --> 03:09.221
<i> It stayed in theaters</i>
<i> for over a year,</i>

03:09.223 --> 03:10.589
<i> And no one loved it</i>
<i> more than me.</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:13.325
Man, I'm so psyched
that we're seeing
<i> et</i> again.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.194
It's the 10th time,
but it feels like the 3rd.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.362
Yeah, I hear 10
is when you really start

03:17.364 --> 03:20.199
To appreciate
the nuances.
Murray: Wait a second.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.501
You've seen this movie
that many times?

03:22.503 --> 03:23.802
Why are you
dragging me here

03:23.804 --> 03:26.371
With all the damn
holiday crowds?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.039
It's about a puppet.

03:27.041 --> 03:31.176
A puppet?
Is fozzie bear
just a puppet?

03:31.178 --> 03:34.046
Is alf just a puppet?

03:34.048 --> 03:34.646
Is yoda...

03:34.648 --> 03:37.316
Yes.
Those are all puppets.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.850
Murray.

03:39.652 --> 03:40.652
Hey.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.119
Hey.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.654
Adult adam: <i> That night,</i>
<i> we had something</i>
<i> even more rare</i>

03:42.656 --> 03:46.391
<i> Than an alien sighting...</i>
<i> My dad's dad, pop-pop.</i>

03:46.393 --> 03:47.826
<i> He was a man of few words.</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:52.064
So, uh, how's things
and whatever you're doing?

03:52.066 --> 03:52.598
Eh.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.866
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, my dad got it</i>
<i> from somewhere.</i>

03:54.868 --> 03:55.734
You?
Eh.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.471
<i> Like any grandpa,</i>
<i> he knew everything</i>
<i> about me.</i>

03:59.473 --> 03:59.838
Barry.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.041
<i> That was actually</i>
<i> a pretty good interaction</i>
<i> with pop-pop.</i>

04:03.043 --> 04:03.875
<i> He had said over three words</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:05.844
<i> And none of them</i>
<i> were obscenities.</i>

04:05.846 --> 04:07.813
(high-pitched hum)

04:08.114 --> 04:12.618
<i> I'll be right here.</i>

04:12.620 --> 04:13.719
Adult adam:
<i> But that night,</i>

04:13.721 --> 04:15.153
<i> I couldn't stop thinking</i>
<i> about pop-pop.</i>

04:15.155 --> 04:17.189
<i> He lived in town</i>
<i> and it was strange</i>

04:17.191 --> 04:18.090
<i> How we barely ever saw him.</i>

04:18.092 --> 04:22.394
<i> I never stopped to think</i>
<i> if it bothered my dad</i>
<i> until this happened.</i>

04:22.396 --> 04:24.029
(murray wails)

04:24.031 --> 04:26.131
What the hell was that?

04:26.366 --> 04:27.332
Why?

04:27.334 --> 04:29.401
Is that horrible sound
coming from your dad?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.870
(whimpering)
<i> I'd always wanted to know</i>

04:31.872 --> 04:33.071
<i> What it'd be like</i>
<i> to see my dad cry,</i>

04:33.073 --> 04:35.540
<i> But then I did</i>
<i> and I instantly</i>
<i> regretted it.</i>

04:35.542 --> 04:37.776
Sounds like
a goat being strangled.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.712
Just look at the screen
and lose yourself
in the movie.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.913
I can't!

04:41.915 --> 04:44.383
(whimpering continues)

04:48.521 --> 04:50.255
What are you wearing?

04:50.257 --> 04:50.756
(scoffs)

04:50.758 --> 04:53.425
It's called
high fashion, erica.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.294
Check it.
I can casually

04:55.296 --> 04:58.397
Flip my jacket over
my shoulder.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.200
Dude,
you're not a model.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.369
Just for saying that,
you're not invited

05:04.371 --> 05:05.671
To my oceanside condo
in kokomo

05:05.673 --> 05:07.306
Where I'll windsurf
with the beach boys.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.307
God, you're an idiot.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.408
All righty.
(chuckles)

05:09.410 --> 05:12.711
Just finished ironing
more outfits for
your head shots.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.347
This stuff if fabulous.
Mmm.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.115
Model walk, model walk,
model walk,

05:17.117 --> 05:19.451
Model walk, model walk,
model walk.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.987
Mom, don't give him money.
It's a scam.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.088
These creeps
troll the malls

05:23.090 --> 05:25.390
Looking for the vain,
weak, and sad.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.260
Hey, barry was born
to model.

05:28.262 --> 05:31.163
Okay, maybe not born
because of his skull shape.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.099
But when that
helmet came off,
it was like looking

05:34.101 --> 05:36.101
At a baby boy version
of cheryl tiegs.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.471
He's gonna be crushed
when he finds out the truth.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.439
And that's on you.
Fine.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.673
If it'll
make you feel better,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.442
I'll go down there
and make sure it's all legit.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.211
I know you think
I've always got
my mom goggles on,

05:46.213 --> 05:48.480
But I'm not as blind
as you think.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.982
Look at that snuggle bug.
He's gorgeous!

05:50.984 --> 05:52.818
(camera shutter clicking)
john: Unbelievable.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.053
Are you sure
you've never done
this before?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.222
Mark my words,
you're gonna be so
rich and famous,

05:57.224 --> 06:00.692
You're gonna be
able to hurt people
without consequences.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.060
Yes!

06:02.062 --> 06:03.462
Oh, he's got
a hair out of place.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.097
You mind if I just
poof him a little?

06:05.099 --> 06:07.132
Please.
Poof away.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.435
Whoa, what is happening
right now?

06:10.437 --> 06:12.204
What?
Did I mess him up?

06:12.206 --> 06:12.604
No.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.841
Do you mind if I take
a couple of the two
of you together?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.776
Absolutely not!
We'd love that.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.144
(camera shutter clicking)

06:19.146 --> 06:19.678
Oh, wow.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.748
You see,
I get a ton of calls
for mother/son teams,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.050
But it's always actors
playing a part.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.120
I've never seen a mother
love her child so much.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.187
That's because no mother

06:29.189 --> 06:31.990
Ever has loved her child
so much.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.859
I've never done this
before.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.294
But for another
100 bucks,

06:36.296 --> 06:38.463
I can make you a model,
too, mom.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.264
No way!

06:39.266 --> 06:40.999
Done.
I made it out to cash.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.134
When did you
even write that?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.536
Adult adam:
<i> And so, they got to work.</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:47.973
<i> And it was something,</i>
<i> all right.</i>

06:47.975 --> 06:49.708
No.
Don't do that.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.009
Stop.
Get off of me!

06:51.011 --> 06:53.245
Stop! No!
Come on.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.679
(camera shutter clicking)

06:54.681 --> 06:56.982
I don't want to be
a model anymore.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.217
Adult adam: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was living her wildest dreams,</i>

06:59.219 --> 07:03.255
<i> I was still processing</i>
<i> the nightmare of seeing</i>
<i> my dad cry.</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:05.590
No way.
That's impossible.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.092
Dad doesn't cry ever.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.460
I know what I saw...

07:08.462 --> 07:11.229
Human tears
coming out of his face.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.434
What?

07:15.535 --> 07:17.169
What's going on?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.337
Why's everyone staring
at me?

07:19.639 --> 07:21.406
What's with
all the staring?

07:21.408 --> 07:22.340
You cried!

07:22.342 --> 07:23.375
When et phoned home,

07:23.377 --> 07:26.211
He left and you cried
and I saw it.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.446
I did not!

07:27.448 --> 07:30.182
I didn't even like
the stupid movie.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.450
Dumb little alien.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.884
All he wanted to do
was get home.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.955
Then it turns all white
and crusty like
an old dog turd.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.024
He loved that boy.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.725
But still,
he had to leave.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.727
I don't want to talk about
the damn movie anymore.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.197
You're welling up.
It's happening.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.498
Nothing's happening!
Come back!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.667
I want to see
what it looks like!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.235
Cry for me!
Cry for me!

07:50.237 --> 07:54.439
After 25 years,
the man cries at a puppet.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.774
Makes no sense.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.009
Unless it's not the puppet

07:58.011 --> 07:59.711
But what
the puppet represents.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.014
We all know that et
is about an absent father,
right?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.750
No. What movie
were you watching?

08:05.752 --> 08:07.953
All I saw
was a magic frogman

08:07.955 --> 08:11.156
Build a telephone
out of a speak & spell.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.924
It was a cry for help.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.592
Dad misses pop-pop,

08:13.594 --> 08:16.528
And it's up to me
to bring them back
together.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.028
Not happening.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.664
After your nana left,
pop-pop lived his life

08:19.666 --> 08:21.700
Filled with bitterness
and anger,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.401
Most of which
was directed at your dad.

08:23.403 --> 08:28.306
And the resentment that
runs between them
is bone-deep.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.809
Man.
That's a lot of anger.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.412
And only a crazy, renegade
han solo-kind of guy

08:34.414 --> 08:35.714
Would try and fix it.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.516
Exactly.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.450
Wait.
What are you saying?

08:38.452 --> 08:41.820
Adult adam:
<i> So, I did what han solo</i>
<i> would do in this situation.</i>

08:41.822 --> 08:43.288
<i> Lure his grandfather over</i>

08:43.290 --> 08:44.723
<i> With a free bowl</i>
<i> of potato salad.</i>

08:44.725 --> 08:46.758
I got a plan
and I need your help.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.426
No, no plan.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.996
That is not a nice man.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.964
Watch this.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.333
Long time no see, ben.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.334
Looking good.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.837
So, you think
you're better than me, huh?

08:59.205 --> 08:59.905
Huh?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.040
Hey, pop-pop,
since you're here,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.009
I was wondering
if maybe you could help me

09:04.011 --> 09:05.443
With a history project
for school.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.678
You know what
I did in school?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.114
Quit so I could work.
What's he doing here?

09:09.116 --> 09:12.684
Getting interviewed
for a school project
about our family.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.119
Wait a minute.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.522
This just occurred to me
right now in this moment.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.559
You should
do the interview together.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.627
(both grumbling)

09:24.196 --> 09:25.230
Tell you what, adam.

09:25.232 --> 09:30.335
Just interview us old-timers
and murray can film it.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.470
So, what do you say,
fellas?

09:32.472 --> 09:34.639
(both grumbling)

09:34.774 --> 09:36.474
We'll take that
as a yes.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.044
Adult adam:
<i> So, with a little help</i>
<i> from pops,</i>

09:39.046 --> 09:39.778
<i> My plan was in motion.</i>

09:39.780 --> 09:43.148
<i> Now all I had to do</i>
<i> was get my closed-off</i>
<i> grandpa to open up.</i>

09:43.150 --> 09:45.317
Okay, so I'm just gonna ask
a few questions,

09:45.319 --> 09:47.752
So speak from the heart.
Dad, we rolling?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.353
No idea.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.555
Great. So, let's start off
with an easy one.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.257
What's your favorite
thing in life?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.792
One word... Family.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.896
When I was 6 years old,
I worked in a button factory.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.930
There was
a terrible fire,

09:58.932 --> 10:03.501
But I got two days off...
Two glorious days.

10:05.304 --> 10:05.837
Wow.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.206
So, what do you say
we shift gears

10:08.208 --> 10:09.975
And talk about
family specifically.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.444
What's your best memory
with your kids?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.746
The day bev was born.

10:15.014 --> 10:15.513
Pop-pop?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.583
I got hit by a car
when I was 29.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.818
It was
a terrible accident.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.319
But I got some money
in the settlement,

10:21.321 --> 10:25.857
And decided to invest it
in a new company called 7up.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.160
Well, until my genius son
talked me out of it.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.261
He hated clear soda.

10:30.263 --> 10:34.666
And I missed out
on the biggest
opportunity of my life!

10:34.668 --> 10:36.167
That's your best memory?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.702
I thought
you said worst.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.170
If we're doing
awful memories,

10:39.172 --> 10:40.472
I got
a few hundred of them.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.539
Okay,
maybe we should take five.

10:41.541 --> 10:45.343
How about when you
left for a year to go
sell frozen beef?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.912
<i> So, apparently,</i>
<i> getting my dad and pop-pop</i>

10:47.914 --> 10:51.082
<i> To open up about</i>
<i> the past wasn't the best</i>
<i> han solo move.</i>

10:51.084 --> 10:53.184
<i> I had to come up</i>
<i> with a plan b and fast.</i>

10:53.186 --> 10:55.687
Hey, pop-pop, do you want
to see <i> et</i> with me?

10:55.689 --> 10:58.623
No.
I have a coupon
for free popcorn.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.191
What size?
Medium?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.260
I have changed my mind
and will go.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.496
<i> So, maybe I couldn't melt</i>
<i> pop-pop's heart...</i>

11:04.498 --> 11:08.299
(door opens)
<i> ...But I knew a little puppet</i>
<i> who could.</i>

11:10.836 --> 11:11.736
You're unreal!

11:11.738 --> 11:14.139
Being a supermodel
is my dream.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.574
I'm not sharing the cover
of <i> vogue</i> with my mom.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.076
I've worked too hard
to get here.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.845
Let me just
take one class with you

11:20.847 --> 11:22.447
And see
where it takes us.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.616
Sound like a plan?
No!

11:24.618 --> 11:26.951
My plan is
to retire this face at 38

11:26.953 --> 11:29.254
'cause I'm realistic
and I know my looks
won't last.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.356
So, I start a super-popular
teen fashion line

11:31.358 --> 11:33.591
Called "barry comfortable"
and then, boom...

11:33.593 --> 11:35.660
I retire to a beach mansion
in kokomo without you.

11:35.662 --> 11:41.566
You think you'll
survive in kokomo
without your mother?

11:41.568 --> 11:42.100
Wrong.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.703
Kokomo will chew you up
and spit you out.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.404
Find your own
island paradise!

11:46.406 --> 11:49.007
Model walk, model walk,
model walk, model walk.

11:49.009 --> 11:49.607
Good stuff.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.411
It's just the normal
fireworks of a creative
partnership.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.114
We really are
the lennon and mccartney

11:56.116 --> 11:59.084
Of mother/son
supermodeling teams.

11:59.086 --> 11:59.484
Wow.

11:59.486 --> 12:03.621
Calabasas really exploited
your greatest weakness...

12:03.623 --> 12:04.189
Your love for us.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.759
Please!
You know nothing
about that man.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.562
Actually I do.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.496
I'm gonna show you
something,

12:11.498 --> 12:14.899
And you have to promise
never to tell a single soul.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.303
Of course.
I'm great at
keeping secrets.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.805
What?
I'm okay at it.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.708
I am the worst.
You shouldn't tell me.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.542
I should go.
No.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.977
You're going to sit
there and listen.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.547
A few years ago,
john calabasas saw me
in the mall

12:29.549 --> 12:31.683
And said I could be
a supermodel.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.052
Pops gave me the money
to take his class.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.420
Why didn't you tell me?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.523
'cause of what's
in here.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.392
There's your proof.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.995
Look at these
tragic, awkward pictures

12:43.997 --> 12:45.497
And tell me
it's not a scam.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.799
What? Yea...
No, you're adorable.

12:47.801 --> 12:51.035
Take off the mom goggles
and really look.

12:55.007 --> 12:55.540
It's a scam.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.375
Adult adam:
<i> While my mom</i>
<i> was feeling duped,</i>

12:57.377 --> 13:01.212
<i> I was attempting to</i>
<i> get pop-pop to</i>
<i> feel anything.</i>

13:01.214 --> 13:02.714
<i> Ouch.</i>

13:02.882 --> 13:06.284
<i> And I was right there,</i>
<i> ready to wipe his tears.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:08.686
Need a tissue?
Yeah.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.856
<i> Or plug his ears.</i>

13:11.957 --> 13:13.525
<i> I was all out of options.</i>

13:13.527 --> 13:14.926
Tell me
when it's over.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.729
<i> My pop-pop was unfixable.</i>
(snoring)

13:17.731 --> 13:21.232
I don't get it.
How do you not feel
bad for et?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.701
I felt sorry
for those poor feds

13:23.703 --> 13:25.170
Because they
couldn't examine
him properly

13:25.172 --> 13:28.173
'cause that stupid kid
was always getting
in the way.

13:28.175 --> 13:28.740
What?

13:28.742 --> 13:30.775
That elliott ought
to be locked up.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.844
You see something,
you report it.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.080
Who watches et
and sides with the
fbi agents?

13:36.082 --> 13:38.383
Who does that?
An american.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.951
That martian
had a magic finger.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.820
We don't know
if he can weaponize that.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.556
It's not a weapon.
That finger's
for healing purposes only.

13:44.558 --> 13:48.126
But we don't know
till we cut him up
and see how he ticks.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.795
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with you?

13:50.797 --> 13:51.629
Me?

13:51.631 --> 13:53.598
You're the deluded one,
barry.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.232
I blame your dad.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.335
This is what happens
when you go soft
on your kids.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.438
They end up
honest-to-god morons.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.875
Adam.
My name is adam.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.379
See you around, pop-pop.

14:08.547 --> 14:12.483
Adult adam:
<i> While the reality of who</i>
<i> pop-pop was finally sunk in,</i>

14:12.485 --> 14:15.486
<i> Barry was about to face</i>
<i> a reality of his own.</i>

14:15.488 --> 14:17.021
Okay,
here comes barry.

14:17.023 --> 14:17.789
Now's the time to tell him

14:17.791 --> 14:19.557
That he's way too
unappealing to be
a model.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.960
No sweat.
I got this.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.027
Hide your daughters!

14:23.029 --> 14:26.130
There's the most handsome
boy on the planet!

14:26.132 --> 14:27.398
Mom.
Fine.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.936
Honey, uh, I'm afraid
I've got some
really bad news.

14:31.938 --> 14:32.503
Yeah, me too.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.838
I just learned
that something

14:33.840 --> 14:36.741
We're really stoked
about's a total sham.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.409
There is no kokomo.
What?

14:38.411 --> 14:41.746
I just made some
calls to the airlines
to price tickets.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.248
Turns out the beach boys
made it up.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.751
Honey, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.
I know.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.854
I feel bad about our fight,
and I'm sorry.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.257
I think I got upset
'cause no one ever told me

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
I was handsome before.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.293
What?
Every day, I tell you

14:55.295 --> 14:57.929
You're the most handsome boy
in the world.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.163
But here's the thing...

14:59.165 --> 15:01.666
Your words
mean nothing to me.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.034
But when a stranger
said it,

15:03.036 --> 15:05.003
Then I realized
it was true.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.138
And nothing
can change that,

15:07.140 --> 15:09.440
Even you being a model,
too.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.975
So, let's do it.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.777
Let's supermodel together.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.779
(laughing) yes!

15:14.781 --> 15:16.581
There may not be
an actual kokomo,

15:16.583 --> 15:20.952
But we're gonna make
enough supermodel money
to build one.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.353
Well, I give up.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.688
Model walk.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.622
Model walk, model walk,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.124
Model walk, model walk,
model walk.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.126
Way to let him
down easy, mom.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.494
Don't you worry.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.331
If my delicious boy
wants to be a model,

15:33.499 --> 15:35.934
Mama's gonna
make him one.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.509
You're okay, right?

15:44.511 --> 15:46.311
No.
Ahh.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.051
But you're getting
over it?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.152
No.

15:54.154 --> 15:54.852
Where's your mom?

15:54.854 --> 15:58.456
She's usually, uh,
good with this stuff.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.624
Beverly?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.092
You probably just want
to be alone.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.329
No.
Beverly,
where are you?

16:07.132 --> 16:10.601
Fine.
Um, what's going on?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.704
I'm getting rid
of all my <i> et</i> stuff.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.372
Pop-pop ruined it
for me.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.308
What'd he say?
He called me a moron.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.476
He can't do that!

16:18.478 --> 16:20.044
Where you going?
Put on your coat.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.080
We're gonna have
a little talk with
your grandfather.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.849
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, my dad had</i>
<i> a very strict rule.</i>

16:24.851 --> 16:28.486
<i> Only he was allowed</i>
<i> to call me moron.</i>

16:29.154 --> 16:30.655
What's
with all the knocking?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.690
For god's sakes,
put some pants on.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.059
It makes people
uncomfortable.

16:35.061 --> 16:35.960
<i> Said my dad.</i>

16:35.962 --> 16:37.495
What is it
you want from me?

16:37.497 --> 16:40.698
I want you to apologize
to my son.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.768
For what?
For calling him a moron!

16:43.770 --> 16:44.936
Apologize!

16:44.938 --> 16:45.737
I'm sorry
you're a moron.

16:45.739 --> 16:49.140
Fine! You don't want
to say you're sorry.

16:49.142 --> 16:49.674
I will.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.909
I'm sorry you worked
in a button factory.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.045
I'm sorry
you didn't invest in 7up.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.481
And I'm sorry that mom left
when we were young,

16:56.483 --> 17:00.018
Leaving you stuck
with two kids
you didn't want!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.919
But you know what
I'm most sorry about?

17:01.921 --> 17:05.156
I'm sorry that you're such
a miserable man

17:05.158 --> 17:08.126
That you're gonna miss out
on your grandkids' lives

17:08.128 --> 17:11.896
The same way
you missed out on mine.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.500
Happy new year, dad.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.903
Adult adam:
<i> All I'd wanted was to bring</i>
<i> everyone closer together,</i>

17:18.905 --> 17:22.807
<i> But what I really did</i>
<i> was drive them further apart.</i>

17:26.945 --> 17:28.279
Yes, people. Own it.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.215
Spines straight now.
Keep those spines straight.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.450
Does anybody know
a four-letter word

17:32.452 --> 17:35.720
For a mongolian tent
made of skins?

17:35.722 --> 17:36.687
It's a scam.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.656
You're not models.
None of us are.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.758
Shh! Please lower
your voice, okay?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.126
And if you're here
to get your money back,

17:42.128 --> 17:46.397
That tiny sign over there
semi-clearly says,
"no refunds."

17:46.399 --> 17:47.098
I don't want a refund.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.867
I want my beautiful boy
to be a model.

17:49.869 --> 17:50.668
Look, mrs. Goldberg,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.271
I may have painted a bit
of a rosy picture.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.605
I can't just
get your son a job

17:54.607 --> 17:58.776
Because it's, like,
really hard to be a model.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.410
Did you hear that?

17:59.412 --> 18:03.147
He said it's really hard
to be a model.

18:03.149 --> 18:03.948
Shh!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.383
Please, I need you
to stay focused, okay?

18:05.385 --> 18:06.818
There's gonna be
a lot of distractions

18:06.820 --> 18:09.854
Just like this
on the catwalks of paris.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.889
Why don't you
just beat it?

18:11.891 --> 18:12.690
Okay, I'll leave.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.492
But barry
had better get a gig.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.626
And if
that doesn't happen,

18:15.628 --> 18:16.994
I'll call
the better business bureau,

18:16.996 --> 18:19.597
The chamber of commerce,
and the 6:00 news.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.234
I might even call your mother.
How would you like that?

18:23.236 --> 18:24.869
Please do not call
my mom.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.538
We have a very complicated
relationship.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.540
Then you best get
to work.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.274
Adult adam: <i> Meanwhile,</i>

18:30.276 --> 18:32.076
<i> I wasn't sure if my dad</i>
<i> was mad at pop-pop or me,</i>

18:32.078 --> 18:36.147
<i> But I thought my</i>
<i> best move was to forget</i>
<i> the whole thing happened.</i>

18:36.149 --> 18:38.716
So, do you have any
new year's resolutions?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.751
I'm thinking about
cutting back on
fruit roll-ups.

18:40.753 --> 18:45.056
I'm sorry you had to see me
blow up like that.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.057
No, I'm sorry.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.559
Pops was right.
I shouldn't have mixed in.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.861
Well, then, why did you?

18:49.863 --> 18:51.295
I don't know.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.064
Maybe...

18:53.265 --> 18:54.765
Because...

18:54.767 --> 18:56.300
I don't want there
to be a world

18:56.302 --> 18:59.537
Where we live a mile away
and never speak.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.539
Look at me.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.609
That will never be us.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.111
Really?

19:07.379 --> 19:08.479
Yeah.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.549
I'll always be
right here.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.118
Adult adam: <i> Sure,</i>
<i> our family wasn't perfect,</i>

19:14.120 --> 19:16.654
<i> But nothing's ever unfixable.</i>

19:16.656 --> 19:20.358
Guess who just booked
his first modeling gig.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.560
You can suck it.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.996
Beverly: Well,
I am very proud

19:24.998 --> 19:26.797
And not at all surprised.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.401
I never really believed
this could have happened.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.669
But you always did.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.604
And I always will.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.806
Oh, boopie.
(chuckles)

19:36.108 --> 19:38.442
Nice work, handsome.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.110
Model walk, model walk.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.711
Model, walk, model walk,
model walk, model walk.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.714
Adult adam:
<i> Barry may not have been</i>
<i> an actual supermodel.</i>

19:43.716 --> 19:47.785
<i> And we may not have</i>
<i> always been what you'd</i>
<i> call a model family</i>

19:47.787 --> 19:48.920
<i> Given all the yelling</i>
<i> and fighting</i>

19:48.922 --> 19:50.254
<i> That went on all the time.</i>
(noisemaker blaring)

19:50.256 --> 19:52.056
<i> Do you have to do that?</i>
(bleep)

19:52.058 --> 19:54.258
<i> You're gonna start</i>
<i> the new year off</i>
<i> acting like an idiot.</i>

19:54.260 --> 19:58.062
<i> But in our house,</i>
<i> it wasn't about</i>
<i> being perfect.</i>

19:58.064 --> 20:00.198
<i> It was about being together.</i>

20:00.200 --> 20:00.865
Dad.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.901
Everything okay?
I pickled some beets.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.837
It's your mom's recipe.

20:07.406 --> 20:08.406
You want to join us?

20:08.408 --> 20:11.008
No, it's, uh,
family time.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.476
You're family.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.945
Thanks, adam.

20:13.947 --> 20:14.879
<i> ¶ baby, why don't we go?</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:17.715
<i> ¶ ooh, I wanna take you</i>
<i> down to kokomo ¶</i>

20:17.717 --> 20:20.851
Beverly: <i> Get in here.</i>
<i> The countdown's starting.</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:22.820
All: Three, two...

20:22.822 --> 20:24.288
One!

20:24.290 --> 20:25.556
<i> Happy new year!</i>

20:25.558 --> 20:27.925
<i> 'cause that's what</i>
<i> new year's is for.</i>

20:27.927 --> 20:30.995
<i> It's a time</i>
<i> for new beginnings...</i>

20:31.063 --> 20:34.098
<i> A time to appreciate</i>
<i> the people you love...</i>

20:34.100 --> 20:37.835
<i> Even if sometimes</i>
<i> they body-slam you.</i>

20:37.837 --> 20:38.569
(noisemaker blaring)

20:38.571 --> 20:40.271
<i> But more importantly,</i>
<i> it's a time to look forward</i>

20:40.273 --> 20:42.940
<i> To the new year</i>
<i> that maybe, just maybe...</i>
Hey, hey!

20:42.942 --> 20:46.978
<i> ...Will be even better</i>
<i> than the last.</i>
Stop it.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.582
(noisemaker blares)

20:52.251 --> 20:55.853
<i> Happy new year.</i>
(noisemaker blares)

20:57.489 --> 21:00.224
<i> Happy new year.</i>

21:03.262 --> 21:07.398
(camera shutter clicking)
ooh. Nice. Great.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.468
Hello, <i> mother/son</i> magazine.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.470
Now, that's a touch of class.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.272
(clicking continues)

21:14.274 --> 21:18.075
Oh, look who's going
to the prom together.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.846
Yee-haw-whoa.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.415
(growling)
aah! Stop it!

21:24.417 --> 21:27.885
Get off me!
I don't want to be
a model anymore!
