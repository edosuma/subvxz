00:00.098 --> 00:02.064
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:02.065 --> 00:03.731
Will you marry me?
Yes.

00:03.833 --> 00:05.000
HEATHER:
Finally!

00:05.101 --> 00:06.101
Where have you two been?

00:06.135 --> 00:07.669
We have a wedding to plan.

00:07.770 --> 00:08.703
People are dying, Detective.

00:08.804 --> 00:10.038
<i>Somehow somebody's getting</i>

00:10.139 --> 00:12.074
ordinary people to do
extraordinary things,

00:12.175 --> 00:14.042
things that
nobody should be able to do.

00:14.143 --> 00:15.410
They're experimenting on them--
they're pushing

00:15.511 --> 00:17.512
<i>the limits of their body</i>
<i>and mind.</i>

00:17.613 --> 00:19.053
We have to stop
whoever's behind this

00:19.114 --> 00:20.414
before someone else gets hurt.

00:20.516 --> 00:21.950
I think we should be
a little bit worried,

00:22.050 --> 00:23.050
especially now we know whoever's

00:23.151 --> 00:24.151
behind it all

00:24.186 --> 00:25.553
is after me.
Except...

00:25.654 --> 00:26.774
I don't think that they know

00:26.789 --> 00:28.422
who you are yet.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.960
♪

00:35.697 --> 00:38.132
♪ This is a short race

00:38.233 --> 00:41.102
♪ And this is a short life

00:41.203 --> 00:42.636
♪ Let's run, not walk...

00:42.737 --> 00:43.971
So...

00:44.072 --> 00:45.572
what do you think?

00:45.673 --> 00:46.874
I don't know.
You like it?

00:46.975 --> 00:48.242
Yeah.

00:48.343 --> 00:51.979
You know, I think
it's beautiful.

00:52.079 --> 00:54.447
Although I thought
the last four places

00:54.549 --> 00:56.149
we looked at
were great, so...

00:56.250 --> 00:59.386
Well, maybe you're not
as picky as I am.

00:59.487 --> 01:02.389
Or as indecisive.

01:02.490 --> 01:05.759
I just, I want
to get married to you

01:05.860 --> 01:08.294
as soon as possible, you know,
in a place just like this.

01:08.396 --> 01:09.729
I know, but...

01:09.830 --> 01:11.398
But what?

01:11.499 --> 01:13.333
Whoever Bob and Carol were
trying to deliver you to?

01:13.434 --> 01:14.767
They're still out there.

01:14.868 --> 01:16.148
And if he knows
you're a beast...

01:16.203 --> 01:17.937
We know for a fact
that they didn't have

01:18.039 --> 01:19.972
a chance to tell
their boss before they died.

01:20.074 --> 01:21.354
But he's still
gonna want to know

01:21.442 --> 01:23.509
who took out his
superhuman assassins,

01:23.610 --> 01:24.890
and that's gonna
lead them to us.

01:24.912 --> 01:26.412
Okay, Catherine.
I thought we agreed

01:26.513 --> 01:27.847
we weren't letting any threats

01:27.948 --> 01:30.249
get in the way
of us getting married.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.084
So, what's really
holding you back?

01:32.185 --> 01:35.955
(Heather humming
"Bridal Chorus")

01:36.056 --> 01:37.156
So?

01:37.257 --> 01:39.091
Yes?

01:39.192 --> 01:41.460
No? That's okay.

01:41.561 --> 01:42.827
We'll just keep looking.

01:42.929 --> 01:44.263
That leaves the Armory Hall

01:44.364 --> 01:45.864
and the St. Boniface Atrium.

01:45.965 --> 01:47.332
But the Atrium only seats 120.

01:47.434 --> 01:50.102
I'm sure we could squeeze
into that.

01:50.203 --> 01:51.470
HEATHER: Are you sure?
'Cause Matthew and I

01:51.571 --> 01:52.804
had a headcount of,
like, a hundred each.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.107
I mean, remember
you have to invite Dad's

01:55.208 --> 01:57.609
partners from the law firm and there's
all of Mom's cousins in Toronto.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.110
Okay, why do I have to
invite Mom's cousins?

01:59.211 --> 02:01.112
I don't even really know them.

02:01.213 --> 02:02.681
Because if Mom were here,
that's what she would want.

02:02.782 --> 02:04.816
Yeah, but she
isn't here, is she?

02:05.818 --> 02:06.851
I'm sorry.

02:06.953 --> 02:08.053
No, that's, it-it's fine,

02:08.152 --> 02:09.152
You don't have to apologize.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.622
I went through the same thing

02:10.723 --> 02:11.963
when I was planning my wedding.

02:12.058 --> 02:12.990
It's hard not having her here

02:13.092 --> 02:14.125
for things like this.

02:14.226 --> 02:15.460
Okay, I've got to get to work.

02:15.561 --> 02:17.695
Wait, I thought you had
to pick up your mom's

02:17.796 --> 02:19.964
sisters from Grand Central?
Well, I have that case, remember?

02:20.065 --> 02:22.567
What case?

02:22.667 --> 02:25.203
Cat, Aunt Lily
and Aunt Claire came

02:25.304 --> 02:27.838
in a day early before
the shower just to see you.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.219
So, please do not blow them off.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.340
Okay, fine, I'll meet you there.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.441
But I got to go, okay?

02:31.476 --> 02:34.544
But if...

02:34.646 --> 02:36.947
What is her problem?

02:39.417 --> 02:40.851
Hey!

02:40.952 --> 02:42.586
Do you really have to go to work
or are you just trying

02:42.687 --> 02:44.187
to get out
of picking up your aunts?

02:44.288 --> 02:45.322
You heard Heather.

02:45.423 --> 02:46.756
This is all about
Mom for her.

02:46.857 --> 02:48.017
And it's only gonna get worse

02:48.025 --> 02:48.992
when Mom's sisters are around.

02:49.093 --> 02:50.193
I'm seriously regretting

02:50.294 --> 02:51.561
having Heather plan my shower.

02:51.662 --> 02:53.163
Yeah, well, still.

02:53.264 --> 02:55.198
Family and weddings tend
to go together, don't they?

02:55.299 --> 02:58.034
Whether you like it or not.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.936
I'm sorry, you've got your own

03:00.037 --> 03:01.171
family issues right
now, don't you?

03:01.272 --> 03:03.272
Have you called
your cousins yet?

03:03.373 --> 03:05.108
No. No, not yet,
but I'm going to.

03:05.208 --> 03:08.177
Vincent...
It's not that easy, all right?

03:08.278 --> 03:10.046
I feel like I left it too long.
I should've called them

03:10.147 --> 03:11.681
last year when I came back
from the dead, right?

03:11.782 --> 03:12.949
I-I didn't know

03:13.050 --> 03:14.583
what to say to them then
and I sure as hell

03:14.685 --> 03:16.352
don't know what
to say to them now.

03:16.453 --> 03:17.386
You tell them that
you're getting married

03:17.487 --> 03:18.420
and you want to reconnect.

03:18.522 --> 03:19.788
It is the perfect time.

03:19.889 --> 03:20.956
I don't know.
I haven't seen them

03:21.057 --> 03:22.024
for years, you know?
Not since

03:22.125 --> 03:23.125
my brothers' funerals.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.193
I know they're not your

03:24.294 --> 03:25.494
brothers, Vincent, but they're

03:25.529 --> 03:27.029
the only family you've got.

03:27.130 --> 03:29.298
Hmm. Wait, you're just

03:29.399 --> 03:31.567
trying to fill up my side
of the church, aren't you?

03:31.668 --> 03:33.202
Maybe, I am.

03:33.303 --> 03:35.370
(quiet laugh)

03:35.471 --> 03:36.972
(laughs)

03:37.073 --> 03:38.974
What?
What? Nothing.

03:39.075 --> 03:41.009
MAN:
<i>Cousin Vinnie!</i>

03:42.211 --> 03:43.945
There he is.
(laughs)

03:44.047 --> 03:45.647
Hey.

03:45.748 --> 03:47.949
Come here, huh?

03:49.152 --> 03:50.218
Look at you.

03:50.319 --> 03:51.786
Ghost from the freaking past.

03:51.887 --> 03:54.222
Hank. Hank, what are...
what you are doing here?

03:54.323 --> 03:55.956
At least you still
remember my name.

03:56.058 --> 03:57.258
VINCENT:
Yeah, yeah. Of-of course.

03:57.359 --> 03:59.060
I just,
I wasn't expecting you.

03:59.161 --> 04:00.395
Surprise.

04:00.496 --> 04:01.656
HANK:
I was starting to wonder

04:01.697 --> 04:03.097
when I was gonna hear

04:03.199 --> 04:04.465
from you again.

04:04.567 --> 04:05.567
You're not too good

04:05.668 --> 04:06.601
for the ol' gang, are you?

04:06.702 --> 04:08.069
VINCENT:
No, no.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.636
No, not at all.
I just...

04:09.738 --> 04:11.105
Things have been complicated.

04:11.206 --> 04:13.273
HANK: Look, I'm just
messing with you, man.

04:13.374 --> 04:15.710
Family's where they got
to let you in, right?

04:15.811 --> 04:17.444
Right.
I brought a couple

04:17.545 --> 04:18.644
distant cousins.

04:18.747 --> 04:20.414
These are my sister's boys.

04:20.515 --> 04:21.582
They were just kids
when you enlisted.

04:21.683 --> 04:22.683
This is Lou.

04:22.718 --> 04:24.085
He's going to law school.

04:24.186 --> 04:25.419
Hey, how's it going?

04:25.520 --> 04:27.421
Following in his
Uncle Hank's footsteps.

04:27.522 --> 04:29.055
Of course.
And this here is Damon.

04:29.156 --> 04:30.591
He works on Wall Street.
Pleasure.

04:30.692 --> 04:31.692
Hey. Nice to meet you.

04:31.759 --> 04:32.879
Hey, somebody has to, right?

04:32.927 --> 04:34.060
So, uh...

04:34.161 --> 04:35.995
you-you tracked down the family?

04:36.097 --> 04:38.131
Catherine, uh,
knew about this, huh?

04:38.233 --> 04:39.833
Ah, yeah,
the professor told us

04:39.934 --> 04:41.667
about the lucky lady.

04:41.769 --> 04:43.236
We're looking forward
to meeting her.

04:43.337 --> 04:45.271
We both thought it
would be a good idea.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.107
Think of it as an
early wedding present.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.008
Couldn't get your nephew
'cause he's overseas.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.410
But I was able to track
down your cousins.

04:51.511 --> 04:53.179
And presto!

04:53.280 --> 04:55.215
Instant bachelor party.

04:55.315 --> 04:56.349
"B-Bachelor party"?

04:56.450 --> 04:57.583
Surprise again!

04:57.684 --> 04:59.452
Hey!
Hey, Vin.

04:59.553 --> 05:00.786
It's great to see you, man.

05:00.887 --> 05:01.887
Wow.

05:01.955 --> 05:04.089
(both laugh)

05:06.960 --> 05:08.427
TESS: ...extra patrols on the Heights
through the weekend, all right?

05:08.528 --> 05:10.896
What are you doing here?

05:10.997 --> 05:12.064
Aunts, train station...

05:12.165 --> 05:13.299
any of this ringing a bell?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.933
Yeah, Heather's picking them up.

05:15.034 --> 05:17.469
So, I scheduled you for
two days off why exactly?

05:17.570 --> 05:18.703
I know, and I appreciate it.

05:18.805 --> 05:20.405
All right, then scram.

05:20.506 --> 05:21.940
Hug your aunts,
hang crepe paper.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.308
I'll see you at the shower.

05:23.409 --> 05:24.977
Hey, should I bring
a karaoke machine?

05:25.078 --> 05:27.278
Actually, Heather's plan is
more high tea at the palace.

05:27.313 --> 05:29.882
And she's even making
cucumber sandwiches.

05:29.983 --> 05:31.483
So what? I got to,
like, wear a hat?

05:31.584 --> 05:32.484
I just want to check out Bob and

05:32.585 --> 05:33.551
Carol's place one more time.

05:33.653 --> 05:35.086
Why? We've been over this.

05:35.187 --> 05:37.255
What do you think
you're gonna find?

05:37.356 --> 05:40.792
Hopefully, something that gives
me a clue as to who hired them.

05:40.893 --> 05:42.594
I think maybe we
missed something.

05:42.695 --> 05:43.995
Do not give me that look, Tess.

05:44.096 --> 05:45.263
I cannot justify going

05:45.364 --> 05:47.098
for tea with my mom's sisters

05:47.199 --> 05:49.000
when somebody's hunting Vincent.

05:49.101 --> 05:51.969
They're not hunting Vincent.
They're hunting beasts.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.404
They don't even know
that he is one. (cell phone ringing)

05:53.505 --> 05:54.438
So you're gonna have to come up

05:54.539 --> 05:55.539
with a better excuse...

05:55.573 --> 05:57.641
Okay.

05:57.742 --> 05:58.943
Hey, Heath.
How's it going?

05:59.044 --> 06:01.012
"How's it going?"

06:01.113 --> 06:02.113
I've got two
tiny little aunts here

06:02.214 --> 06:04.615
with two giant suitcases
and no sister.

06:04.716 --> 06:06.249
And no sister!

06:06.351 --> 06:08.819
I'm sorry.
I'm just got hung up at work.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.253
They're here
to see you, not me!

06:10.355 --> 06:12.122
Hey, Heather. It's Tess.

06:12.223 --> 06:14.090
Yeah, you know what?
It's my fault.

06:14.192 --> 06:15.759
It's a, it's a case.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.661
Mm-hmm, but it's just one thing.

06:17.762 --> 06:18.662
She'll be home in an hour.

06:18.763 --> 06:20.831
Fine.

06:20.932 --> 06:22.933
All right, you got one hour.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.701
See what you can find.
Then...

06:24.802 --> 06:26.136
go make nice with your aunts.

06:27.238 --> 06:30.006
Go!
Okay.

06:34.245 --> 06:35.578
Double top!

06:35.679 --> 06:37.046
Got some catching up
to do, little bro.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.548
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Until you choke

06:38.649 --> 06:41.751
and go bust like always.

06:41.852 --> 06:43.085
Remind you of couple
other brothers?

06:43.186 --> 06:44.920
Yeah.

06:45.021 --> 06:47.056
You know, I still
miss them every day.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.157
Yeah, I know.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.492
Listen, um,

06:49.593 --> 06:50.827
you're not mad at me

06:50.927 --> 06:51.927
about all this, right?

06:51.995 --> 06:52.995
No. No, not at all, man.

06:53.096 --> 06:54.396
I just...

06:54.497 --> 06:56.165
Look, I wanted
to connect with my family.

06:56.266 --> 06:58.000
I just, I didn't know how.

06:58.101 --> 07:00.402
HANK:
Well, here we are gentlemen.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.636
Oh!
Triple distilled,

07:01.738 --> 07:04.006
30 years in sherry casks.

07:04.107 --> 07:05.307
Top shelf.

07:05.408 --> 07:06.842
Eh, uh, thanks, Hank.

07:06.943 --> 07:08.244
But I think I'm
okay with beer.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.345
Oh, come on.

07:09.412 --> 07:10.545
One last blowout, right?

07:10.646 --> 07:12.013
Only the best.

07:13.148 --> 07:16.217
Cheers.
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

07:16.318 --> 07:17.819
Mm. Hmm.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.221
Oh.

07:20.322 --> 07:22.223
DAMON: Oh!

07:22.324 --> 07:23.992
Pay up, little brother!
Oh, come on! Double or nothing.

07:24.093 --> 07:25.927
Where's your money?
Now that really reminds me

07:26.028 --> 07:27.561
of the old days--
those Keller

07:27.662 --> 07:29.063
family softball games?

07:29.164 --> 07:30.899
Loser always bought the beer.
Which was

07:31.000 --> 07:32.200
usually your team
'cause the Keller brothers

07:32.301 --> 07:34.068
were always winning.

07:34.169 --> 07:36.337
(scoffs)
Revisionist history, am I right?

07:36.438 --> 07:40.108
Yeah, not really
ringing a bell actually.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.575
What? Come on, uh,
every Labor Day,

07:41.676 --> 07:44.211
Prospect Park, whole family.

07:44.312 --> 07:45.352
You really don't remember?

07:45.447 --> 07:46.847
I guess I must've been

07:46.948 --> 07:49.049
at law school at the time, huh?

07:49.150 --> 07:51.452
Too bad. It was good times.
JT: Yeah.

07:51.553 --> 07:54.988
WOMAN:
I'm looking for Vincent Keller.

07:56.892 --> 07:58.358
Hey. Yeah.

07:58.460 --> 08:01.061
Yeah, what's going on?
Is Catherine okay?

08:01.162 --> 08:03.363
Mr. Keller,
you're under arrest.

08:03.464 --> 08:04.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:04.632 --> 08:06.099
You got the wrong guy.

08:07.235 --> 08:09.303
(music playing)

08:09.404 --> 08:11.805
Oh, no, my orders
are quite clear.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.373
You have the right
to remain silent.

08:13.474 --> 08:15.409
Oh! Oh! Okay.

08:15.509 --> 08:17.109
Uh... JT?

08:17.210 --> 08:18.210
(crowd gasps)

08:18.312 --> 08:20.046
JT?!
BOTH: Oh!

08:20.147 --> 08:21.548
Oh...

08:21.649 --> 08:23.215
I...

08:23.317 --> 08:25.718
I heard you like
a woman in uniform.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.720
You're welcome.

08:27.822 --> 08:29.288
I don't know anything
about this, I swear.

08:29.389 --> 08:30.557
Hey, guys?

08:30.658 --> 08:32.390
You know, this is,
this is completely

08:32.491 --> 08:35.394
unnecessary. Guys?

08:35.495 --> 08:37.229
It's all covered, sweetie.

08:37.331 --> 08:38.464
You're calling the shots.

08:38.565 --> 08:41.667
(gunshots outside)

08:41.768 --> 08:43.336
Sorry.

08:43.437 --> 08:46.105
(gunshots continue)

08:46.206 --> 08:48.107
Hey, get down! Get down!
(woman screaming)

08:48.208 --> 08:50.509
Get off of my street!

08:51.744 --> 08:52.744
Step back!

08:52.846 --> 08:54.245
Get back!

08:54.347 --> 08:55.948
Back!
Get back, man!

08:59.018 --> 09:01.520
Clear out, all of you!
Get back!

09:04.691 --> 09:06.491
Whoa! Did you see that?

09:07.860 --> 09:09.560
No, uh, we got to go!
Vincent!

09:11.230 --> 09:13.131
Vincent!
No! Hey, Hank! Hank!

09:14.200 --> 09:15.533
Hank! Hank!

09:16.602 --> 09:17.802
Get down, man!

09:21.573 --> 09:22.673
Hey!

09:24.810 --> 09:26.210

JT: Vincent,
down here!

09:37.956 --> 09:39.223
Hank's been shot!

09:40.625 --> 09:41.825
Ow!

09:43.514 --> 09:44.835
You all right?
I'm okay.

09:57.952 --> 10:00.520
How's Hank doing?
Uh, he's doing okay.

10:00.621 --> 10:02.322
Well, the bullet
went clean through.

10:02.423 --> 10:03.991
So he should make
a good recovery.

10:04.092 --> 10:05.558
But I just, I don't know.

10:05.659 --> 10:07.361
I can't believe I let
that happen to him.

10:07.461 --> 10:08.996
You can't blame yourself,
Vincent.

10:09.097 --> 10:10.737
You didn't even know
he was gonna be here.

10:10.798 --> 10:14.167
No, but apparently you did.

10:14.269 --> 10:16.269
Sorry. Was it so bad?

10:16.370 --> 10:18.405
No. But in a perfect
world, it would've been

10:18.506 --> 10:20.373
a nicer surprise if
it was my brothers.

10:20.474 --> 10:22.709
But it was fine, you know,
until Hank got shot.

10:22.810 --> 10:24.110
All right,
speaking of which,

10:24.211 --> 10:25.879
how's our superhuman
shooter doing?

10:25.946 --> 10:28.147
Well, he's isolated
and sedated, but

10:28.248 --> 10:29.982
it's strange, you know, unlike
all the other experiments,

10:30.083 --> 10:31.518
it seems like he's
getting better.

10:31.619 --> 10:33.052
What do you mean?

10:33.153 --> 10:35.487
Well, he wasn't trying to escape
or climb the walls, you know?

10:35.588 --> 10:38.891
It's as if he was slowly
returning to his natural state.

10:38.992 --> 10:40.526
That doesn't make
any sense, though.

10:40.627 --> 10:42.228
Yeah, I know,
which why I'm getting JT

10:42.329 --> 10:44.163
to test his blood,
see if there's any differences.

10:44.264 --> 10:45.831
I don't like the fact
this happened right outside

10:45.933 --> 10:47.333
your bachelor party--
it's too close to home

10:47.434 --> 10:48.901
for it to be a coincidence.

10:49.001 --> 10:50.903
Come on, okay, I wasn't
his target, all right?

10:51.003 --> 10:54.272
In fact, it was like
he didn't have a target at all.

10:54.373 --> 10:55.607
Yeah, but just the
fact that it was

10:55.708 --> 10:56.909
on that street in
our neighborhood,

10:57.009 --> 10:58.249
it might mean that
whoever hired

10:58.344 --> 11:00.278
Bob and Carol is
closing in on us.

11:00.379 --> 11:01.819
Or it might mean
that you were trying

11:01.915 --> 11:02.881
to avoid
your mom's sisters.

11:02.982 --> 11:04.616
I am not avoiding them.

11:04.717 --> 11:05.951
(imitates buzzer)
I'm sorry, try again.

11:06.052 --> 11:07.919
Okay, I am just saying

11:08.020 --> 11:09.921
that when I went to Bob
and Carol's apartment,

11:10.022 --> 11:11.722
it had been cleaned
out, professionally.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.959
Which means that's it's possible
that whoever's behind this

11:14.060 --> 11:16.061
is doing everything
they can to figure out

11:16.162 --> 11:17.442
who's stopping
their experiments.

11:19.999 --> 11:22.399
The sample on the left is
from when the shooter was

11:22.501 --> 11:24.134
first put in the ambulance,

11:24.235 --> 11:27.237
and the one on the right was
taken less than an hour ago.

11:27.339 --> 11:28.405
Cells are normal.

11:28.507 --> 11:30.942
Which means he's
normal now, too.

11:31.042 --> 11:32.076
How can that be?

11:32.177 --> 11:33.310
You said that he climbed
the fire escape

11:33.411 --> 11:34.445
like Spider-Man or something.

11:34.546 --> 11:36.106
Doesn't that mean
he has to be enhanced?

11:36.181 --> 11:38.615
Could he have burned it out,
like what happened with you?

11:38.716 --> 11:40.917
I'm still working on
what happened with me.

11:41.019 --> 11:43.920
But what happened with this guy
wasn't caused by that serum.

11:44.022 --> 11:46.323
That's the result
of a blood-borne parasite.

11:46.424 --> 11:47.958
A parasite, like a bug?

11:48.059 --> 11:49.793
So he caught this
like a cold?

11:49.894 --> 11:51.795
Well, I don't know exactly

11:51.896 --> 11:53.864
how it got transmitted,
but it did.

11:53.965 --> 11:56.800
And this parasite's
fast-acting, too,

11:56.901 --> 11:58.301
which means he had
to have contracted it

11:58.402 --> 11:59.970
a day or two ago at most.

12:00.070 --> 12:02.438
So somebody enhanced a parasite
so it would spread?

12:02.540 --> 12:05.041
That's a more efficient delivery
system than the serum, right?

12:05.142 --> 12:07.276
And potentially more
widespread, too.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.379
Whoever's behind this
is accelerating things.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.847
In our backyard.

12:10.948 --> 12:12.548
We should track
the movements of the shooter

12:12.649 --> 12:14.650
over the last 24 hours,
see where he contracted it.

12:14.751 --> 12:16.019
Before it becomes an outbreak,

12:16.120 --> 12:18.488
and we've got superhuman maniacs
coming out of our ears.

12:18.588 --> 12:19.522
Okay, I'm gonna go back
to the precinct,

12:19.623 --> 12:20.623
see if I can put
a profile together,

12:20.724 --> 12:22.058
where he lives...
No, I'm doing that.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.692
You're going home.
Home?

12:23.793 --> 12:26.295
Cat, I promised Heather
you'd be there an hour ago.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.997
Yeah, that was before
someone shot at Vincent.

12:28.097 --> 12:29.632
Not at me, near me.

12:29.733 --> 12:30.866
Okay, but the point is...
The point is--

12:30.967 --> 12:32.535
you're the one
who keeps bitching

12:32.636 --> 12:35.804
about having to hold her life
back for this crap, so don't.

12:35.906 --> 12:38.140
So far, it's
an isolated incident,

12:38.241 --> 12:39.808
the shooter's
under control.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.911
Come on, it doesn't take two
cops to run a background check.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.579
Okay, but you're captain,
you shouldn't have to...

12:43.680 --> 12:45.040
Pull rank and order you
to go home?

12:46.315 --> 12:48.183
Okay, uh, how
about you go deal

12:48.284 --> 12:50.885
with my cousin, and I'll
go deal with your aunts?

12:50.986 --> 12:52.720
Deal.

12:52.821 --> 12:54.756
Go, both of you,
I'll stay here

12:54.857 --> 12:56.724
and keep working on the samples,
see what I can figure out.

12:56.825 --> 12:58.505
Okay, promise me that
if you find anything,

12:58.594 --> 13:00.095
you'll call me.
Of course.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.196
Okay.
Bye.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.467
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

13:07.803 --> 13:09.070
Catherine, hi.

13:09.171 --> 13:11.172
We've been
waiting for you.

13:11.273 --> 13:13.875
(whispering): Where the hell are you?
CATHERINE: Um, yeah.

13:13.976 --> 13:15.677
I'm in the hallway, and I don't
want to come in right now.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.611
Can you just handle things
for a little bit longer?

13:17.712 --> 13:19.880
What?!

13:19.981 --> 13:22.249
No. Look, I don't know
what your issue is, Cat,

13:22.350 --> 13:23.784
but they're here to see you,

13:23.885 --> 13:26.019
so you better get in here
and deal with them,

13:26.121 --> 13:27.708
or I swear, I will tell them
you're engaged to a beast.

13:27.709 --> 13:28.498
You wouldn't.

13:28.499 --> 13:30.391
Although I think
Aunt Lily would find it sexy.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.525
Ask me how I know.

13:31.626 --> 13:33.026
(gasps)

13:33.128 --> 13:35.261
Oh, look, here's Cat now!

13:36.664 --> 13:39.232
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

13:40.935 --> 13:42.002
Oh, my God!

13:42.103 --> 13:44.004
Aunt Claire,
come on, up you go.

13:44.105 --> 13:45.405
Get some water,
Heather.

13:46.774 --> 13:47.874
You all right?

13:47.976 --> 13:49.676
Um, yeah, I'm okay.

13:49.777 --> 13:50.943
I'm sorry, I just...

13:51.044 --> 13:53.346
when I saw you
come in through the door,

13:53.447 --> 13:55.181
I thought I was
seeing a ghost.

13:55.282 --> 13:58.017
You look...
you look just like her.

13:58.119 --> 13:59.885
LILY: It's true,
Catherine, you really do.

13:59.987 --> 14:02.187
I can't even imagine how much
you must miss your mother.

14:03.624 --> 14:05.225
Especially at a
time like this.

14:12.398 --> 14:13.933
Hey.

14:14.034 --> 14:15.935
Hey.

14:16.036 --> 14:18.403
So am I gonna
live, Doc?

14:18.505 --> 14:19.538
(chuckles)
Yeah, it looks like it.

14:19.640 --> 14:20.640
Thanks to you.

14:20.707 --> 14:22.041
Heard you called in a chit,

14:22.142 --> 14:23.642
got me the same surgeon
who does the mayor.

14:23.743 --> 14:26.911
Don't think I won't
return that favor.

14:27.013 --> 14:29.114
I am not looking
for favors.

14:29.215 --> 14:30.815
Oh, and don't worry,
I learned my lesson.

14:30.883 --> 14:33.385
No more strippers--
that is for sure.

14:33.486 --> 14:34.786
(chuckles)

14:34.887 --> 14:36.388
Not to worry.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.657
Look, uh...

14:38.758 --> 14:41.660
Hank, I got to
apologize to you, man.

14:41.761 --> 14:43.662
I, uh...

14:43.763 --> 14:45.997
I'm really sorry for being
out of touch for so long.

14:46.098 --> 14:49.000
You know, it's just ever since
I got back from Afghanistan,

14:49.101 --> 14:51.302
a lot has changed for me.

14:51.403 --> 14:53.304
Yeah.

14:53.405 --> 14:55.406
Yeah, a lot changed
around here, too.

14:55.507 --> 14:57.408
You know, I got
married, had a kid.

14:57.509 --> 14:59.943
He's, uh, he's four, by the way.

15:00.045 --> 15:01.546
Oh, yeah, that's awesome.
Congratulations.

15:01.647 --> 15:03.247
You know, I'd like
to meet them someday.

15:03.348 --> 15:04.748
Yeah, well,
just what you need, huh?

15:04.749 --> 15:05.749
Another distant cousin.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.117
Sorry?

15:07.219 --> 15:08.553
I mean, look, we both know

15:08.654 --> 15:10.388
I can't replace your brothers.

15:10.489 --> 15:12.890
I-I don't expect...
Yeah, but that's life, right?

15:12.991 --> 15:15.292
You know, we...
we hung around together,

15:15.393 --> 15:17.661
then we grew up,
went our separate ways.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.096
Me to law school,

15:19.197 --> 15:20.998
you and your brothers
to the firehouse.

15:21.099 --> 15:22.966
I mean, God rest their souls.

15:24.769 --> 15:26.636
Pretty damn hard
to compete with that.

15:26.738 --> 15:28.258
Yeah, well,
there's no need to compete.

15:28.272 --> 15:29.906
I mean, you're
a big shot lawyer now.

15:30.007 --> 15:31.675
You're doing pretty well
for yourself.

15:31.775 --> 15:33.677
I do okay, yeah.

15:33.777 --> 15:36.313
Especially considering
nobody expected me to.

15:36.414 --> 15:37.681
Yeah, the truth is

15:37.781 --> 15:39.701
Grandpa never thought much
of my old man, either.

15:39.783 --> 15:41.451
Come on, Hank,
I don't think that's true.

15:41.552 --> 15:43.620
(scoffs) You know,
your father, your brothers,

15:43.721 --> 15:45.755
you guys were the real heroes
of the family.

15:45.856 --> 15:50.259
No amount of success on my side
could ever compete with it.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.395
Especially after
the martyr thing.

15:55.532 --> 15:56.966
What are you talking about?

15:57.067 --> 15:59.602
Oh, I-I'm just saying, you know?

15:59.703 --> 16:01.437
Now I get to be my kid's hero.

16:01.538 --> 16:03.004
You got to be kidding me, right?

16:03.106 --> 16:05.040
You know, my brothers,
they died on duty

16:05.141 --> 16:07.776
rushing into those Towers.
Hey, Vinnie, come on, relax.

16:07.877 --> 16:10.279
I-I didn't mean
anything by it, I'm just...

16:10.380 --> 16:11.680
MAN: Dr. Keller.
What?

16:11.781 --> 16:13.215
They need you in E.R., stat.

16:13.316 --> 16:15.317
WOMAN (over P.A.): All available physicians,
please report...

16:15.418 --> 16:16.785
What?

16:16.886 --> 16:19.054
All available security,
please report to Emergency.

16:19.155 --> 16:21.522
Vinnie...

16:21.624 --> 16:25.961
You and your mom were always
so much alike, Catherine.

16:26.062 --> 16:28.563
Always had big
things going

16:28.664 --> 16:30.398
(chuckles)
Worlds to save.

16:30.499 --> 16:32.400
Apples don't fall
far from the tree.

16:32.501 --> 16:34.669
Eh, sometimes they do--
depends on the slope.

16:34.771 --> 16:37.505
Must have been hard
for you two growing up,

16:37.606 --> 16:39.073
what with Vanessa
always off

16:39.174 --> 16:40.975
doing such important work
for the government.

16:41.076 --> 16:43.344
Vaccinating children
in Africa,

16:43.445 --> 16:45.580
helping wounded soldiers
in Afghanistan.

16:45.681 --> 16:46.847
Yeah, wounded.

16:47.949 --> 16:49.651
Oh, there you are.

16:49.752 --> 16:51.286
Just a month old.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.921
You and your mom were
virtually inseparable

16:54.022 --> 16:55.322
from the day
you were born.

16:55.423 --> 16:57.191
You would scream
bloody murder

16:57.292 --> 16:58.926
if anyone else
tried to hold you.

16:59.027 --> 17:00.294
Even your father.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.662
(sighs)
Poor Thomas.

17:01.763 --> 17:02.797
Well, she was a baby.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.765
(laughs nervously)

17:04.866 --> 17:05.866
Babies cry.

17:05.867 --> 17:07.434
Who else, uh,
wants more tea?

17:07.535 --> 17:09.035
Oh, no, I'm just
gonna float away.

17:09.136 --> 17:10.376
I wouldn't mind
a glass of wine.

17:10.471 --> 17:11.471
I'll get the bottle.

17:11.472 --> 17:13.138
I'll help you pour.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.544
Don't you dare
ruin this.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.012
By what, telling them
that Thomas wasn't

17:19.113 --> 17:20.314
my biological father?

17:20.415 --> 17:21.548
And what good
would that do?

17:21.648 --> 17:22.769
You need to do
some forgiving

17:22.784 --> 17:24.624
and forgetting, or you need
to start faking it.

17:26.820 --> 17:28.021
Oh, what's that?

17:28.122 --> 17:29.455
For the shower tomorrow.

17:29.556 --> 17:31.024
It's a memory lantern.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.226
For your mother--
you write the name

17:33.327 --> 17:35.628
of your ancestor on it,
then you light it

17:35.729 --> 17:39.665
and launch it into the sky to
invite their spirit to visit.

17:39.766 --> 17:41.801
You're the bride,
you should write her name.

17:41.901 --> 17:44.169
You know, Mom never
taught me calligraphy,

17:44.270 --> 17:47.072
she was too busy
doing other things.

17:47.173 --> 17:49.141
Well, we'll all
do it together.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.644
It'll be like all our voices
calling out to her.

17:51.745 --> 17:53.312
You know what,
I'm more concerned... (phone rings)

17:53.413 --> 17:54.714
Telephone!

17:54.815 --> 17:56.114
It's Vincent.

18:01.287 --> 18:03.088
Have some wine?
Yeah.

18:03.189 --> 18:05.023
How are things
going on your end?

18:05.124 --> 18:08.060
Hey, not good.

18:08.161 --> 18:10.695
Know that outbreak that JT
warned us about?

18:10.796 --> 18:12.731
It's happening.

18:12.832 --> 18:14.899
MAN (over phone):
Ow, sir, stop moving!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.369
(clamoring)

18:20.636 --> 18:22.203
TESS: Whoever they are, they're
definitely targeting our turf.

18:22.304 --> 18:24.882
Every outbreak's in the 125th.
How many so far?

18:24.883 --> 18:26.617
Ten and counting.
It doesn't make sense.

18:26.718 --> 18:28.619
The innocents that were chosen
for serum experiments before

18:28.720 --> 18:30.221
were specifically
targeted.

18:30.322 --> 18:31.655
Why change to this
outbreak approach?

18:31.756 --> 18:32.890
What are they trying
to accomplish?

18:32.991 --> 18:34.625
I don't know,
but if they're trying

18:34.726 --> 18:38.029
to make things worse and fast,
they're sure as hell doing that.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.663
I've got detectives backtracking
the victims' movements

18:39.764 --> 18:42.065
for the last 24 hours, see
if we can find patient zero.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.366
Right now, everybody just thinks
it's a new street drug,

18:44.402 --> 18:45.669
but the wider this breaks...

18:45.770 --> 18:47.671
Okay, just,
it doesn't make sense.

18:47.772 --> 18:50.306
I don't think they'd want
exposure any more than we do.

18:50.408 --> 18:51.975
So what is it that
they do want?

18:52.076 --> 18:54.077
Look, I hate to say it,
but maybe you were right.

18:54.178 --> 18:56.413
Maybe they created these
supercharged experiments

18:56.514 --> 18:58.415
to flush out whoever
killed Bob and Carol.

18:58.516 --> 19:00.417
Maybe they figure whoever
recognizes the pattern

19:00.518 --> 19:01.817
is who they're
looking for.

19:01.919 --> 19:03.253
I don't know.

19:03.354 --> 19:05.055
If they infected
one shooter, then maybe.

19:05.156 --> 19:07.357
But infecting all
of these innocent people?

19:09.960 --> 19:12.494
Tess, I cannot believe
that when Vincent called me

19:12.596 --> 19:14.664
for a second
I was actually relieved.

19:14.765 --> 19:16.933
My first thought was--
at least I don't have

19:17.034 --> 19:18.768
to hear any more
about Saint Vanessa.

19:18.869 --> 19:20.670
Was it really that bad?

19:20.771 --> 19:23.673
My aunts are trying to invite
the ghost of my mother

19:23.774 --> 19:25.775
to my bridal shower.

19:25.876 --> 19:28.077
Yes, it was.

19:28.178 --> 19:30.079
Poor Heather,
she doesn't understand,

19:30.180 --> 19:32.514
and I don't want to burst
her bubble and tell her

19:32.615 --> 19:34.516
that our precious mother
is the one

19:34.617 --> 19:36.452
that turned Vincent
into a beast.

19:36.553 --> 19:38.753
But it was an accident, though, right?
Does it matter?

19:38.821 --> 19:40.556
Look at what
it's cost him, Tess.

19:40.656 --> 19:41.957
Look at what it's cost us.

19:42.058 --> 19:44.359
For all we know,
this outbreak really is

19:44.461 --> 19:47.361
all about trying
to find Vincent.

19:47.463 --> 19:49.397
Thanks again, Mom.

20:02.677 --> 20:04.378
(door opens)

20:04.480 --> 20:05.580
Hey.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.148
How bad is it out there?

20:07.249 --> 20:10.718
Ugh, we got 12 more
in isolation beds as we speak.

20:10.819 --> 20:11.919
And it's getting worse.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.121
You know,
Catherine's right.

20:13.222 --> 20:14.722
This thing can't be
a coincidence.

20:14.823 --> 20:16.724
Our neighborhood, her precinct,
the hospital--

20:16.825 --> 20:19.392
I mean, it's all too close
to home for my liking.

20:19.494 --> 20:20.728
Yeah, well, it's
closer than you think.

20:20.829 --> 20:21.829
Take a look at this.

20:24.699 --> 20:27.400
Studying the parasite sample,
I thought I recognized something

20:27.502 --> 20:29.569
in the way it mutated
the victim's DNA.

20:29.671 --> 20:32.072
I wasn't sure,
but then I compared it

20:32.173 --> 20:34.508
to the serum sample
in the earlier victims.

20:34.609 --> 20:37.444
Notice anything?
Nucleotide repeats.

20:37.545 --> 20:39.579
So minute I didn't see
it at first, but there it is

20:39.680 --> 20:41.948
in every victim,
which means...

20:42.049 --> 20:44.651
Which means they're
using proto-beast DNA.

20:44.752 --> 20:48.087
From the original species
from 10,000 years ago.

20:48.189 --> 20:50.490
How is that even possible?

20:50.591 --> 20:51.791
I don't know.

20:51.892 --> 20:53.793
Whoever these guys are,

20:53.894 --> 20:58.497
they're using the same mutation
that made you... you.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.634
CATHERINE:
<i>Proto-beast DNA?</i>

21:01.735 --> 21:03.202
Are you sure?

21:03.303 --> 21:04.637
I thought they were making
superhumans, not superbeasts.

21:04.738 --> 21:06.139
Well, that might explain

21:06.239 --> 21:07.640
why Bob and Carol
thought I was so valuable

21:07.740 --> 21:09.475
to whoever's behind
it all, right?

21:09.576 --> 21:11.644
I can't believe
this is happening.

21:11.744 --> 21:13.612
I thought we were done chasing beasts.
Believe me, I wish we were.

21:13.713 --> 21:15.681
Well, at least this'll narrow
down who we're looking for.

21:15.782 --> 21:17.015
I mean, there can't be
that many people

21:17.116 --> 21:18.817
that even know
about the proto-beast.

21:18.918 --> 21:20.986
No, which is why I think we
should go and see your father.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.822
My father? Why?
Why?

21:23.923 --> 21:25.691
Because he's one of
the few people

21:25.792 --> 21:27.112
who does know, that's why.
No way.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.626
I have enough
family drama right now

21:28.728 --> 21:30.796
without adding
my biological father to the mix.

21:30.897 --> 21:33.231
Okay, look, I am not his biggest
fan either, all right?

21:33.332 --> 21:34.666
I know this is gonna be hard,

21:34.767 --> 21:36.467
but if someone is using
proto-beast DNA,

21:36.569 --> 21:37.889
then Reynolds may
be our only hope

21:37.904 --> 21:39.404
at finding out
who it is

21:39.505 --> 21:41.506
or where the hell they got it
in the first place.

21:41.607 --> 21:42.873
Okay, fine.

21:42.974 --> 21:44.175
We'll talk to him.

21:48.314 --> 21:50.081
REYNOLDS:
<i>I'd rather talk about</i>

21:50.182 --> 21:52.217
that ring you're wearing.
Congratulations.

21:52.318 --> 21:54.051
I had no idea
you two were engaged.

21:54.152 --> 21:55.820
We're not here to get
your blessing, Dad.

21:55.921 --> 21:57.721
You tried to get the groom
executed, remember?

21:57.789 --> 21:58.923
That doesn't
exactly reserve you

21:59.024 --> 22:00.858
a spot on the
Save the Date list.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.693
All right,
then why are you here?

22:02.794 --> 22:05.329
Someone is experimenting
on innocents,

22:05.430 --> 22:06.864
trying to push
the limits

22:06.965 --> 22:09.333
of what's physically
and mentally possible.

22:09.434 --> 22:10.901
By using proto-beast DNA.

22:11.002 --> 22:12.469
Proto-beast?

22:13.605 --> 22:15.105
Who the hell has access to that?

22:15.206 --> 22:17.240
You tell us.
REYNOLDS: I don't know.

22:17.341 --> 22:21.044
We only used proto-beast
to make super soldiers.

22:21.145 --> 22:23.113
This sounds like
it could be even bigger.

22:23.214 --> 22:25.448
This sounds like somebody
is actually getting close

22:25.549 --> 22:27.283
to perfecting Vanessa's formula.

22:27.384 --> 22:28.551
Meaning what?

22:28.652 --> 22:29.652
See, your mom had this theory

22:29.754 --> 22:30.987
that, in success,

22:31.088 --> 22:32.808
her experiments could
skip a couple of steps

22:32.890 --> 22:34.089
in the evolutionary chain.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.125
Turn humans into superhumans.

22:36.226 --> 22:39.895
And you really have no idea
who could be behind it all?

22:39.996 --> 22:41.430
No.

22:41.531 --> 22:42.965
Everybody I know

22:43.066 --> 22:45.100
in that line of work is dead.
Yeah, including Mom.

22:45.201 --> 22:46.335
Vanessa didn't mean for things
to turn out this way.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.003
You know that.

22:48.104 --> 22:49.938
But things did turn out
this way, didn't they?

22:50.039 --> 22:51.439
Which means Vincent

22:51.540 --> 22:53.341
is in even more danger
than he was before.

22:53.442 --> 22:54.509
Well, don't blame your mother.

22:54.610 --> 22:55.778
Why the hell not?

22:55.879 --> 22:57.646
And who are you
to defend her?

22:57.747 --> 22:59.181
She'd dead
and you're in prison

22:59.282 --> 23:00.448
for the same reason.

23:00.549 --> 23:02.117
You are both to
blame for this mess.

23:02.218 --> 23:03.752
You shouldn't be mad at her.

23:03.853 --> 23:05.788
Well, too bad,
because I am.

23:05.889 --> 23:07.355
And I'm mad
at you, too.

23:07.456 --> 23:09.758
The only difference is,

23:09.858 --> 23:12.294
she's not around anymore
to answer for this, is she?

23:12.395 --> 23:15.163
Okay, look...
you're telling me

23:15.264 --> 23:18.300
that you have no idea how we can
figure out who is behind it?

23:18.401 --> 23:19.401
No.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.005
Although, if the victims

23:24.106 --> 23:25.439
have proto-beast in their blood,

23:25.540 --> 23:26.974
you could track them,

23:27.075 --> 23:28.609
maybe even all the way
back to their source.

23:28.710 --> 23:30.644
No, I mean, there-there are
barely trace amounts,

23:30.745 --> 23:32.379
I can hardly get a fix on them.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.615
Hey, that's all you got.

23:34.716 --> 23:37.318
You're connected to these
experiments by blood, Vincent.

23:37.419 --> 23:38.752
Use that.

23:42.557 --> 23:44.658
Hey, Catherine.

23:46.461 --> 23:48.429
Um...

23:51.098 --> 23:54.034
I gave you a box from your mom
after I sold the house.

23:54.135 --> 23:55.302
Have you looked inside?

23:55.403 --> 23:56.669
No.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.404
You should.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.727
You might find some of
the answers you're looking for.

24:10.017 --> 24:11.718
CATHERINE:
All right, so we go back to JT,

24:11.819 --> 24:13.386
see if he can put together
enough proto-beast DNA

24:13.487 --> 24:15.020
so that we can track down...

24:15.121 --> 24:16.889
No, so <i>I</i> can track
down the source.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.725
I am not letting
you go by yourself.

24:18.826 --> 24:21.146
Whoever's behind this may not
know that you're a beast yet,

24:21.161 --> 24:23.195
but if you show up on their
doorstep, they may find out.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.664
I will never let
that happen, okay?

24:24.765 --> 24:25.898
I will call you
before that happens.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.166
Hey, listen to me.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.601
I thought we
promised each other

24:28.702 --> 24:30.222
that we wouldn't let
this kind of stuff

24:30.270 --> 24:31.737
get in the way of us
living our lives, right?

24:31.838 --> 24:33.739
How am I supposed
to go to my shower

24:33.840 --> 24:36.275
and even pretend to care
about ribbon bouquets

24:36.376 --> 24:37.943
and paper lanterns
with all of this going on?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.445
Listening to my sister
and my aunts

24:40.546 --> 24:42.281
talk about what
a great mother I had,

24:42.382 --> 24:43.715
how much good she did.
Hey.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.950
Hey, you deserve
to have this shower, okay?

24:46.051 --> 24:47.753
And it's-it's
about you,

24:47.854 --> 24:49.421
it's not about your mom.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.189
Vincent, there is
an outbreak going on.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.624
People are getting hurt.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.725
Yeah, and what's new?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.026
Look, I'm
sorry, okay?

24:55.127 --> 24:56.261
I-I don't mean

24:56.362 --> 24:57.962
to minimize the situation,

24:58.063 --> 24:59.364
but there's nothing
you can do about it right now.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.032
All right?
Let me deal with it.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.401
You go see your family.
'Cause trust me,

25:03.502 --> 25:06.137
don't let anything take
that away from you.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.438
Come on.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.843
♪

25:15.580 --> 25:17.048
(chattering, laughing)

25:17.149 --> 25:18.716
You know, the wedding's
kind of sudden.

25:18.817 --> 25:19.983
but it'll be great.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.121
She's doing dishes
at her own shower.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.923
Can you please drag her
back to the party,

25:26.024 --> 25:28.104
because I am out of ammo
and I'm about to do a toast.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.064
Thank you.

25:34.165 --> 25:37.000
TESS:
Hey, how's it going?

25:37.101 --> 25:38.902
I was just cleaning up a bit.

25:39.003 --> 25:41.238
And avoiding.
Still.

25:41.339 --> 25:42.973
Cat, come on, I know that
there's a lot going on,

25:43.074 --> 25:44.474
but if you're not going
to enjoy the wedding stuff,

25:44.575 --> 25:45.842
why even have it?

25:45.944 --> 25:47.577
I would love to have
nothing on my mind

25:47.678 --> 25:48.979
but naughty charades

25:49.080 --> 25:50.447
and choosing between
fondant and buttercream,

25:50.548 --> 25:52.081
but that is not my life.
Okay,

25:52.182 --> 25:53.450
well, you got to turn it off
sometimes, all right?

25:53.551 --> 25:54.818
Or you're going
to burn yourself out.

25:54.919 --> 25:56.419
And it's buttercream
all the way.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.855
I'm not really sure why
this is even a question.

25:58.956 --> 26:01.023
(fork dings against glass)
HEATHER: Uh, attention.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.926
Attention, everyone.

26:03.026 --> 26:04.928
Um, I'd like
to propose a toast

26:05.028 --> 26:06.329
to my sister Catherine

26:06.430 --> 26:09.265
and her Prince Charming,
Vincent.

26:09.366 --> 26:11.600
If anyone deserves
a "happily ever after,"

26:11.701 --> 26:13.035
it's them.

26:14.637 --> 26:16.472
Hear, hear!
WOMAN: Cheers.

26:16.573 --> 26:19.308
Congrats.
Congrats, Cat.

26:19.409 --> 26:21.477
Mm. And I'd like to thank

26:21.578 --> 26:23.112
my Aunt Lily
and my Aunt Claire

26:23.213 --> 26:24.513
for coming out
from Albany.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.047
I...

26:26.148 --> 26:27.883
I know, like them, we all wish

26:27.984 --> 26:29.384
that my mom could be here today

26:29.486 --> 26:32.053
to celebrate,
too, um...

26:32.154 --> 26:35.223
but in our hearts,
she will always be here.

26:35.324 --> 26:37.893
(quiet applause)

26:37.994 --> 26:40.529
And I know
one thing for sure.

26:40.630 --> 26:42.830
I know she'd be
so happy for you, Cat...

26:42.931 --> 26:45.967
for finding
the love of your life.

26:46.068 --> 26:47.369
For finding Vincent.

26:47.470 --> 26:48.503
No thanks to her.

26:48.604 --> 26:49.837
Cat...
What?

26:49.938 --> 26:51.239
What? You
think Mom

26:51.340 --> 26:52.640
would be happy for me, Heather?

26:52.741 --> 26:54.476
Despite the fact
that she all but

26:54.576 --> 26:55.676
tried to destroy Vincent?

26:55.777 --> 26:57.497
Cat, don't do this...
CATHERINE: No! I am...

26:57.513 --> 27:00.414
I am sick of hearing about
how wonderful Mom is,

27:00.516 --> 27:03.250
how special Mom is,
how much good Mom did.

27:03.351 --> 27:04.886
You don't know
what she did, Heather.

27:04.987 --> 27:06.387
None of you do.

27:06.488 --> 27:07.722
I can't--

27:07.823 --> 27:08.990
I can't stand
this anymore.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.825
I won't.

27:10.926 --> 27:13.193
Heather, Mom is the one
that hurt Vincent.

27:13.294 --> 27:14.428
Do you understand me?

27:14.529 --> 27:16.030
Mom did that to him

27:16.131 --> 27:17.731
and he and I have been
paying for it ever since,

27:17.832 --> 27:19.733
so I will be damned
if I am gonna sit here

27:19.834 --> 27:21.235
and write on paper lanterns

27:21.336 --> 27:22.869
and wish that she was here,
because I don't!

27:22.970 --> 27:24.838
I am glad that she isn't here,

27:24.939 --> 27:27.741
because I will never forgive her
for what she did, ever!

27:31.846 --> 27:34.447
Cat...

27:34.549 --> 27:36.783
(door closes)

27:48.335 --> 27:51.404
♪ Since you're falling away

27:52.317 --> 27:54.640
♪ Since you're hiding
your face ♪

27:54.741 --> 27:57.810
♪ There's nothing
I can do about that... ♪

27:58.310 --> 27:59.710
Okay, if you're here to tell me

27:59.811 --> 28:01.545
what a bad sister I am,
you don't have to.

28:01.646 --> 28:02.813
I already know.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.047
Oh, okay.
I'll just go, then.

28:04.148 --> 28:06.183
Come on, Cat.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.318
Give yourself a
break for once.

28:08.419 --> 28:09.820
You had a lot of
pent-up emotions

28:09.921 --> 28:11.754
and it just came
out, that's all.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.489
Yeah, at the worst
possible time.

28:13.590 --> 28:15.192
Yeah, well, weddings
tend to bring out

28:15.293 --> 28:17.027
the ugly truth
in families, Cat.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.995
That and Thanksgiving--
at least in my family.

28:19.096 --> 28:21.998
Heather must hate me.
No, not at all.

28:22.099 --> 28:23.666
She's rocked,
for sure.

28:23.767 --> 28:25.935
I mean, she had no idea

28:26.036 --> 28:27.370
about what your mother
really did,

28:27.471 --> 28:29.405
but I think
she gets it.

28:29.506 --> 28:31.666
And besides, she's your sister,
she has to forgive you.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.944
Come on, Cat,
you're a great sister.

28:35.045 --> 28:36.879
You just have
a lot on your plate.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.715
I see it every day.

28:38.816 --> 28:40.856
That's why I'm always telling
you to live your life,

28:40.951 --> 28:43.385
regardless of
this crap.

28:43.486 --> 28:45.054
And you know what?
What happened last night,

28:45.155 --> 28:47.289
how you felt,
what you said...

28:47.390 --> 28:49.258
that is life.

28:49.359 --> 28:51.961
And now that it's out,
it's a good thing.

28:52.062 --> 28:53.863
Yeah, it doesn't feel so good.

28:53.964 --> 28:56.232
It will,
with time.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.633
You have enough
secrets, Cat.

28:58.735 --> 29:01.069
Being mad at your mom
shouldn't be one of them.

29:03.638 --> 29:05.038
Yeah.

29:05.139 --> 29:07.140
I still don't understand
how infecting over,

29:07.242 --> 29:08.743
what, a dozen people,
with a parasite

29:08.844 --> 29:09.977
that doesn't
last very long

29:10.078 --> 29:11.445
accelerates
their experiments.

29:11.546 --> 29:12.713
It doesn't.

29:12.814 --> 29:14.114
It may affect
more people faster,

29:14.215 --> 29:15.535
but it's certainly
less efficient.

29:15.584 --> 29:17.251
Yeah, then
why do it?

29:17.352 --> 29:19.753
Uh, the only way to find out
is to backtrack the proto-beast.

29:19.854 --> 29:21.654
Use the scent
in one of the victims

29:21.756 --> 29:23.323
and see who he
caught the bug from.

29:23.424 --> 29:24.664
Okay, so there's
enough in there

29:24.725 --> 29:25.893
for me to identify
it in a victim?

29:25.994 --> 29:27.727
Extracted it from my own blood.

29:27.828 --> 29:29.763
I mean, from when
I had the serum in me.

29:29.864 --> 29:31.265
Good thing I'm
a neurotic hoarder

29:31.366 --> 29:33.500
and held on to all of my samples.
Wait.

29:33.601 --> 29:36.002
So you had proto-beast
in your blood, too?

29:36.103 --> 29:37.437
Yep.

29:37.538 --> 29:38.971
Guess that makes us
blood brothers, huh?

29:39.072 --> 29:41.474
Yeah, man, I
guess it does.

29:41.575 --> 29:43.676
HANK:
Hey!

29:43.778 --> 29:46.312
Long time no see.
VINCENT: Hank, hey.

29:46.414 --> 29:48.415
I-I didn't know you were
being discharged today.

29:48.516 --> 29:49.749
HANK:
No kidding.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.618
I haven't seen hide
nor hair of you

29:51.719 --> 29:54.253
since you ran out yesterday
for your big emergency.

29:54.354 --> 29:55.487
Yeah, look, I'm
sorry about that,

29:55.588 --> 29:56.755
but it really
was an emergency

29:56.856 --> 29:58.124
and it still is,

29:58.225 --> 29:59.525
so I'm in a bit
of a hurry.

29:59.626 --> 30:00.960
Hey, don't worry about it.

30:01.061 --> 30:02.228
Never expected much anyway.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.631
For... for my campaign.

30:05.732 --> 30:08.867
I'm running for councilman
and, you know,

30:08.968 --> 30:10.602
I figured I could
use a little help

30:10.703 --> 30:12.805
from the family hero, but...

30:12.906 --> 30:14.205
Wait, is that why you showed up?

30:14.307 --> 30:15.507
To use Vincent for publicity?

30:15.608 --> 30:17.443
HANK:
Well, why not?

30:17.544 --> 30:19.478
Well, it's not like I'm asking

30:19.579 --> 30:21.112
to borrow money or anything.

30:21.213 --> 30:23.214
This guy is something else.

30:23.316 --> 30:25.350
Mm-hmm.
HANK: You know what? Forget it.

30:25.451 --> 30:26.551
I don't need you anyway.

30:26.652 --> 30:28.553
Well, that makes
two of us, Hank.

30:28.654 --> 30:30.388
Listen,
you know,

30:30.489 --> 30:32.123
JT called you because
I'm getting married

30:32.224 --> 30:33.825
and he figured a guy

30:33.926 --> 30:35.893
should have some family
around on his big day, right?

30:35.995 --> 30:37.329
But I think we both know

30:37.430 --> 30:38.830
that we may have
the same last name,

30:38.831 --> 30:40.165
but that doesn't make us family.

30:40.266 --> 30:42.567
So, on that note,

30:42.668 --> 30:44.702
thanks for coming,
sorry about your leg, man,

30:44.803 --> 30:47.572
best of luck, but don't
expect my vote, okay?

30:47.673 --> 30:49.239
Let's go.

30:49.341 --> 30:51.241
What he said.

30:57.248 --> 30:58.849
So far, we've got
four out of 12 victims

30:58.950 --> 31:00.417
getting coffee or bagels
at Schwartzman's Deli

31:00.518 --> 31:02.086
on Spring Street
in the last 24 hours.

31:02.187 --> 31:03.587
TESS:
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

31:03.688 --> 31:05.728
four out of 12 people in
the whole neighborhood did.

31:05.790 --> 31:06.923
I got coffee there
yesterday myself.

31:07.025 --> 31:09.059
Okay, what about
the local buses?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.327
According to MetroCard,

31:10.428 --> 31:11.761
these three were on the same bus

31:11.863 --> 31:13.763
between 8:45 and 9:15.
No.

31:13.865 --> 31:15.832
No, JT said
the delivery mechanism

31:15.933 --> 31:18.001
needs to be more
specific than that.

31:18.102 --> 31:19.435
Otherwise, half the area
would be infected by now.

31:19.537 --> 31:21.337
Okay, what are we missing?

31:21.438 --> 31:23.719
There's gotta be some common
denominator, but where? What?

31:25.977 --> 31:28.111
Hold on, hold on.
A few of the vics

31:28.212 --> 31:30.714
contacted Wheels Down
Messenger Service.

31:30.815 --> 31:31.780
Do you see any receipts?
Um...

31:31.882 --> 31:33.049
Yes.

31:33.150 --> 31:35.418
One, two, four, six.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.353
And they're all
from the same messenger.

31:37.454 --> 31:39.255
All right, that's a 50% hit rate.
That's pretty convincing.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.456
And insidious.

31:40.557 --> 31:42.091
Pump an innocent
messenger

31:42.192 --> 31:43.592
full of contagious parasites,

31:43.693 --> 31:45.528
send him out with a full
load of packages to deliver,

31:45.629 --> 31:47.530
and that would infect every
single person he touches.

31:47.631 --> 31:49.698
That could reach every corner
of the neighborhood.

31:49.799 --> 31:51.033
Right, but even if this guy
is patient zero,

31:51.134 --> 31:52.267
how do we find him?

31:52.368 --> 31:53.903
I mean, sure,
you can get

31:54.004 --> 31:55.270
a manifest
from the company,

31:55.371 --> 31:57.139
but these guys,
they set their own route.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.642
We have no way of knowing
where his next delivery will be.

31:59.743 --> 32:00.976
You won't have to.

32:01.077 --> 32:02.244
He's got
proto-beast blood.

32:03.079 --> 32:04.246
I can track him.

32:16.722 --> 32:19.090
(crowd chatter)

32:29.336 --> 32:31.308
Are we getting close?

32:31.309 --> 32:33.531
Look, maybe I should take it
from here, okay?

32:33.532 --> 32:34.832
If he really is patient zero,

32:34.933 --> 32:36.434
I don't want you
getting infected.

32:36.535 --> 32:37.535
What about you?

32:37.569 --> 32:38.769
I'll be fine.

32:38.871 --> 32:40.038
We're both proto-beasts,

32:40.139 --> 32:41.806
I probably should be immune.
Probably?

32:41.907 --> 32:43.108
Vincent, you're gonna
have to do better than that

32:43.209 --> 32:44.376
to chase me off.

32:58.223 --> 33:00.290
This way.

33:00.392 --> 33:02.493
He's making a delivery
around the corner, let's go.

33:02.594 --> 33:04.028
(tires squealing)

33:04.129 --> 33:06.730
(siren wailing)

33:06.831 --> 33:07.864
(tires screech)

33:07.965 --> 33:09.099
Police, stay away from him!

33:17.242 --> 33:20.010
(tires screeching)

33:22.479 --> 33:24.781
(siren wailing)

33:39.329 --> 33:40.596
Stop!

33:47.871 --> 33:49.372
(tires screeching)

33:54.978 --> 33:56.779
Police, freeze!
VINCENT: Hey, hey, hey!

33:56.880 --> 33:59.114
Listen to me, okay?
You've been infected.

33:59.215 --> 34:00.849
You need to get into quarantine.
Come with us.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.051
You think I'm sick?

34:02.151 --> 34:03.719
I'm invincible!

34:03.820 --> 34:05.387
So you're the ones
they're looking for.

34:05.488 --> 34:07.690
Who... All right, who
are you talking about?

34:07.791 --> 34:09.725
(engine revs)
Smile!

34:16.532 --> 34:17.699
Who gave you that camera?

34:17.800 --> 34:18.699
Came with the juice.
No, listen--

34:18.801 --> 34:20.435
listen
to me, man.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.304
That "juice" is deadly, okay?
It is messing with your head.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.306
Let us help you.
I don't need help,

34:24.407 --> 34:25.706
I just need to fly.

34:25.808 --> 34:27.475
VINCENT:
Hey, no, no!

34:27.576 --> 34:29.110
Do not make that.
Listen to me!

34:29.210 --> 34:30.878
You will not make that.
Do not do it!

34:30.980 --> 34:32.580
They say I can.

34:32.681 --> 34:34.447
VINCENT:
No, no, no, no!

34:35.985 --> 34:37.719
(whoops)

34:37.820 --> 34:38.987
(truck horn blasts)

34:39.088 --> 34:40.221
(car horns honking)

34:40.322 --> 34:42.322
(crashing)

34:42.424 --> 34:45.426
(brakes screeching,
horns honking)

34:48.563 --> 34:50.097
Who would do that
to somebody?

34:50.197 --> 34:51.364
I don't know.

34:53.735 --> 34:56.870
But whoever it is,
they just made us.

34:59.274 --> 35:00.473
WOMAN:
He came from up there!

35:00.574 --> 35:01.742
He's not breathing.

35:01.843 --> 35:03.877
MAN:
Get an ambulance!

35:06.624 --> 35:08.324
TESS:
<i>Sorry, bad news.</i>

35:08.426 --> 35:10.192
We checked the
messenger's camera,

35:10.294 --> 35:12.161
but the site it was
linked to is gone,

35:12.262 --> 35:14.363
and the registered owner
is a post office box.

35:14.464 --> 35:15.932
Of course it is.

35:16.033 --> 35:17.934
Which means whoever's
behind these experiments

35:18.035 --> 35:19.435
knows who we are,

35:19.536 --> 35:21.503
but we still don't
know who they are.

35:21.604 --> 35:22.771
But on the plus side,

35:22.872 --> 35:24.173
we solved the puzzle

35:24.274 --> 35:26.442
and stopped the epidemic,
so, yay, team.

35:26.543 --> 35:28.044
VINCENT:
But on the minus side,

35:28.145 --> 35:29.478
they got what
they wanted, right?

35:29.579 --> 35:31.179
That whole outbreak
was just staged

35:31.280 --> 35:32.514
to try and
flush us out,

35:32.615 --> 35:34.616
see who was
after them.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.051
Okay.
So what's our next move?

35:36.152 --> 35:37.886
Tahiti?
I'll drink to that.

35:37.987 --> 35:39.354
Yeah.

35:39.456 --> 35:41.457
What about you?
What are you thinking?

35:41.558 --> 35:43.058
Honestly?
I think we're screwed.

35:43.159 --> 35:44.526
The experiments were bad enough,

35:44.627 --> 35:46.227
but now that there are targets
on our backs...

35:46.329 --> 35:48.729
Hey, it'll be fine, okay?
We will fix this.

35:50.132 --> 35:51.532
I've gotta go talk to Heather.

35:51.633 --> 35:53.401
Okay. You sure
you're okay to drive?

35:53.502 --> 35:55.203
Yeah. Yeah.

35:55.304 --> 35:57.605
Call you later.
Mm-hmm.

36:00.676 --> 36:01.843
She'll be okay.

36:01.944 --> 36:04.244
Yeah, I hope so.

36:04.346 --> 36:06.313
Hey, V, about Hank...

36:06.414 --> 36:08.883
If I'd' have known he was such a loser,
I never would've...

36:08.984 --> 36:11.185
Ah, don't worry about it.

36:11.286 --> 36:12.720
It all worked out just fine.

36:12.821 --> 36:14.321
Yeah? How?

36:14.422 --> 36:15.756
Well, you know,

36:15.858 --> 36:17.338
I've been feeling
pretty guilty lately

36:17.359 --> 36:19.059
about not reconnecting
with my family,

36:19.160 --> 36:20.861
but like old
cousin Hank said,

36:20.962 --> 36:23.197
he can't replace my brothers.

36:23.298 --> 36:24.598
So...

36:24.699 --> 36:27.501
I finally worked out
who my real family are.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.735
Cheers.

36:28.836 --> 36:31.205
Cheers.
Cheers.

36:45.386 --> 36:47.754
(exhales)

37:01.535 --> 37:04.970
♪

37:12.579 --> 37:13.746
Catherine.

37:13.847 --> 37:15.113
(exhales)

37:15.214 --> 37:16.381
There's so much

37:16.482 --> 37:17.650
I need to tell you.

37:17.751 --> 37:19.151
But I didn't,

37:19.252 --> 37:20.920
because the people
I've been working for,

37:21.021 --> 37:22.154
they can't be trusted.

37:22.255 --> 37:24.790
And I was afraid
that if you knew,

37:24.891 --> 37:26.891
they might hurt you--
or Heather, too.

37:26.992 --> 37:29.294
So I'm taping this, because

37:29.395 --> 37:31.463
if something happens to me,

37:31.564 --> 37:33.932
I just want you
to know that I did...

37:34.033 --> 37:38.903
what I tried to do,
I did because

37:39.004 --> 37:42.106
I hoped things
would be better, safer.

37:42.207 --> 37:44.008
For you, for everyone.

37:44.109 --> 37:46.611
Someday you'll find out

37:46.712 --> 37:48.446
what really happened,

37:48.547 --> 37:51.749
because that's just who you are.

37:51.850 --> 37:54.953
You'll want answers, justice.

37:55.054 --> 37:56.353
(sobs)

37:56.455 --> 37:59.356
Just, please, be careful.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.959
I don't want you
to have to go through

38:02.060 --> 38:04.027
what I'm going through.

38:04.129 --> 38:06.297
I love you so much.

38:06.398 --> 38:09.533
You mean everything to me.

38:13.037 --> 38:15.639
I want to make amends
for my mistakes,

38:15.740 --> 38:17.173
but if I can't...

38:17.274 --> 38:19.175
(sobs)

38:19.276 --> 38:21.845
...take care of your sister,

38:21.946 --> 38:23.313
Take care of yourself.

38:23.414 --> 38:26.483
Find love, Catherine.

38:27.785 --> 38:29.185
Happiness.

38:31.555 --> 38:33.723
Don't just try
to save the world.

38:36.494 --> 38:38.694
(phone ringing on video)

38:42.065 --> 38:43.233
Hello?

38:44.668 --> 38:46.169
Stay where you are, Catherine.

38:46.270 --> 38:48.203
I'll, um,
I'll bring the jumper cables.

38:48.304 --> 38:49.784
Do you have a sweater with you?
(sobs)

38:51.742 --> 38:53.408
Keep the doors locked
till I get there.

38:53.510 --> 38:54.610
(sobbing)

38:56.412 --> 38:57.780
(muffled gunshots)

39:05.588 --> 39:07.623
(Heather sobs)

39:10.493 --> 39:11.693
Cat.

39:19.536 --> 39:21.169
I'm so sorry.

39:21.270 --> 39:23.604
I'm sorry, too.

39:27.209 --> 39:29.577
(crying, sniffling)

39:41.190 --> 39:43.558
(door opens)

39:50.999 --> 39:52.266
Got your message.

39:55.570 --> 39:57.270
You okay?

39:57.371 --> 39:58.906
I am now.

39:59.007 --> 40:00.373
What's going on?

40:00.474 --> 40:02.609
I don't know--
I've been so angry

40:02.711 --> 40:04.578
at my mother for so long,

40:04.679 --> 40:08.048
it's strange not being angry
at her anymore.

40:08.149 --> 40:09.416
Okay.

40:09.517 --> 40:10.584
So what's changed?

40:10.685 --> 40:13.420
I guess I got answers.

40:13.521 --> 40:16.323
I understand now.

40:16.424 --> 40:18.191
And I miss her.

40:21.762 --> 40:23.496
God...

40:23.598 --> 40:25.131
it is a lot easier

40:25.233 --> 40:26.966
holding onto being angry
than being sad.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.903
I suppose all this
wedding talk brought it up.

40:31.004 --> 40:33.239
That's a good thing, right?

40:33.340 --> 40:35.674
Yeah, it is.

40:37.410 --> 40:40.947
I just wish she was here
to see this.

40:41.048 --> 40:43.315
To see us.

40:48.622 --> 40:51.323
(sighs)

40:51.424 --> 40:52.824
So...

40:52.925 --> 40:55.160
are you ready
to do this?

40:56.363 --> 40:58.297
Pick a place,
get married?

40:58.398 --> 41:00.331
No more
obstacles.

41:01.934 --> 41:03.501
(glass shattering)

41:09.742 --> 41:10.942
Come on! Come on!

41:11.043 --> 41:12.644
(glass shattering)

41:12.745 --> 41:14.112
Go!
