  It was a heartbreaking loss
  yesterday on Super Sunday.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.123
         Morning, Sam.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.057
   Hey, can I have the usual?

00:25.092 --> 00:26.358
             Sure.

 <i> I caught up with quarterback</i>
 <i> Jake Gillette after the game.</i>

00:27.428 --> 00:29.495
   Well, you know, of course
     we came here to win.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.829
   I wish we could have made
         that happen.

00:30.865 --> 00:31.830
  <i> But we were just outplayed.</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:33.565
     <i> Jake, this must feel</i>
     <i> exceptionally bitter</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:35.300
     <i> after winning it all</i>
          <i> last year.</i>

00:35.336 --> 00:38.137
     What about the rumours
          of a trade?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.172
          Uh... Coach!

00:40.207 --> 00:41.940
         Come on over.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.976
    <i> Hey. Good goin' today.</i>

00:44.011 --> 00:45.177
      <i> Oh, thanks, coach.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.679
  Uh, Coach Kerrigan, he, uh,
  he was my high school coach,

00:47.715 --> 00:48.947
 he taught me everything I know
        about football.

00:48.983 --> 00:49.982
           Samantha.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.283
   Your latte and bear claw?

00:51.318 --> 00:53.585
        Oh, um, thanks.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.987
       <i> He never gave up.</i>

00:55.022 --> 00:57.256
       That's my father.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.258
 And he's even gonna be better
          next year.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.359
              Huh.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.527
        That's your dad?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.828
              Yup.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.096
       So, you must know
        Jake Gillette.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.833
  'Cause, you could definitely
      introduce me to him.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.536

01:10.571 --> 01:13.105
  Hey, I was just watching you
             on TV.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.506
     Yeah, you should have
          been there.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.808
       Jake played great.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.776
They just couldn't bring it home
           this year.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.445
   Oh, well, maybe next year.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.948
         Yeah... maybe.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.116
         You okay, Dad?

01:24.151 --> 01:25.517
     Yeah, well, I'm better
           than okay.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.453
           I'm great.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.887
     Okay, what's going on?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.856
  Well, I've made a New Years'
           decision.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.826
  What, you gonna skip the tie
       on casual Fridays?

01:33.861 --> 01:36.328
     No, I'm gonna retire.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.296

       Love you, sweetie.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.205
<i> (Crowd) We still love you, Jak!</i>

01:46.240 --> 01:47.172
          Jake! Jake!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.341
   Can I have your autograph?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.209
          Thanks, man.
        You're the best.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.877
           Thank you.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.045
            [laughs]

01:54.882 --> 01:55.747
            Thanks.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.982
              Hi.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.417
        Thank you guys.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.852
            Thanks.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.692
          Jake, buddy.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.026
     Here, sit in my seat.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.026
   Take a seat, right there.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.027
            Perfect.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.663
     Hey, listen. I've been
     on the phone all day.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.599
     Interviews, couple of
         commercials,

02:13.634 --> 02:16.268
     got some walk-on parts
     on some shows for ya.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.369
     You're gonna love it.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.338
          Yeah, great.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.007
Uh, they know I lost yesterday,
            right?

02:22.042 --> 02:24.243
      Eh, there's losing,
    and then there's losing.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.178
   You had yourself one heck
         of a season.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.547
 And by the way, you look great
           on camera.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.884
   This is a win for us, and
   there's always next year.

02:31.919 --> 02:32.951
           Is there?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.019
     I mean, have you heard
           anything?

02:34.054 --> 02:35.854
  Not definitely, but they're
      not gonna trade ya.

02:35.890 --> 02:36.889
            Not yet.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.891
   That's why we have to look
      at the opportunities

02:38.926 --> 02:41.460
  that are out there right now
     and capitalize on 'em.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.628
   You know, you gotta start
        thinking about

02:42.663 --> 02:44.663
 that next phase of your life.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.302
         Hey, Samantha.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.870
  You see the game last night?

02:51.906 --> 02:52.905
            Uh, no.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.207
           Not a fan.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.175
     What do you got there?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.443
  Oh, um, our publishing dates
         for the year.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.244
              Oh.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.479
    Of course, some of those
           may slide,

03:00.514 --> 03:03.448
     but it's pretty close.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.883
   Where's the rest of them?

03:04.919 --> 03:06.318
     That's the full list.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.388
These are almost all non-fiction
         and self-help.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.156
"Bonkers for Brussels Sprouts,"
            really?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.491
     It's a working title.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.626
       Brussels sprouts
    are very big right now.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.429
Where are my young adult titles?

03:17.464 --> 03:20.232
   We've decided to postpone
       that initiative.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.500
      You're postponing it
       for another year.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.401
             No...

03:22.436 --> 03:23.669
 Harry, you hired me to launch
           a series

03:23.704 --> 03:24.903
     of young adult books.

03:24.939 --> 03:25.470
         Samantha, I...

03:25.506 --> 03:26.271
     It's been four years.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.907
    I've got amazing authors
           lined up.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.442
      You... you just keep
         postponing it.

03:30.477 --> 03:33.478
    We're not postponing it
          for a year.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.981
      We're postponing it
         indefinitely.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.916
          <i> I'm sorry.</i>

03:37.952 --> 03:39.818
   But we all love your work.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.853
    We want you to stay on,
          absolutely.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.622
          And do what?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.924
    I mean, student literacy
        is what I know.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.161
     It's been my passion
   since I was a kid myself.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.964
 We want you to focus full-time
       on the cookbooks.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.764
          What if I...

03:52.800 --> 03:53.832
            Ah, ah.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.135
    I'll talk to the board.

03:57.171 --> 03:58.170
             Okay.

03:59.306 --> 03:59.838
            Thanks.

03:59.873 --> 04:00.973
     <i> I don't blame Harry.</i>

04:01.008 --> 04:03.275
       I mean I want to,
         but I can't.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.443
          It's just...

04:04.478 --> 04:06.612
  It's just the entire reason
  you went to work for them.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.714
            Exactly.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.215
       Speaking of jobs,

04:10.251 --> 04:12.484
   happen to run into my dad
    in the hallways today?

04:12.519 --> 04:14.019
     Is he really retiring?

04:14.054 --> 04:15.053
     No one can believe it.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.956
  The whole school is walking
       around in a daze.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.459
    It's like we've entered
    some alternate reality.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.526
             Same.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.295
   <i> Graham's doing an article</i>
       <i> in the newspaper,</i>

      <i> to have a ceremony</i>

04:25.232 --> 04:28.133

 <i> so you'll come to that, right?</i>

04:28.168 --> 04:30.135
      Uh... I don't know.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.336
            [sighs]

04:31.372 --> 04:33.372
In all these years, you've never
   come home for Snowcoming.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.240
      You used to love it.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.675
      Well, that's because
         I moved away.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.710
        Three hours and
        10 minutes away.

 me decorate for the Snow Ball,

04:44.852 --> 04:45.984
         and chaperone.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.152
   Do you think Jake's gonna
           be there?

04:47.187 --> 04:48.820
    'Cause I don't wanna go
           if he is.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.689
     <i> Not that I've heard.</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:53.525
             Okay.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.593
         Okay to what?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.662
       Okay to all of it.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.163
  Let me arrange the time off
      and I'll be there.

             Hey...

05:07.941 --> 05:09.508
          Looks cold.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.149
              Bye.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.919
          Snowcoming.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.753
        This is a thing?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.021
         It is a thing.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.890
      I mean... at least
     in my hometown it is.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.693
  The whole town gets together
   to celebrate the new year.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.094
 There's a dance at the school,

05:29.129 --> 05:30.462
it's called the Snowball Dance.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.530
       Of course you do.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.898
 It's all about second chances

05:32.933 --> 05:35.434
and celebrating the good things
           to come.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.501
       There's a bonfire,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.704
and everyone writes down a wish
       for the new year.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.639
They put it on a piece of paper
   and then throw the paper

05:40.674 --> 05:41.873
         into the fire.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.542
        Oh, and there's
       a Snow Bowl game.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.977
     Like a football game,
       but in the snow.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.979
  Usually disintegrates pretty
 quickly into a snowball fight.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.115
   We consider it a good year
 if no one goes to the hospital

05:50.150 --> 05:51.917
       with hypothermia.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.018
       This sounds crazy.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.053
  I don't remember you taking
     this time off before.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.388
    That's because I haven't
           been back.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.456
   At least not for a while.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.757
  I don't go back that often.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.492
    But I'm going back now.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.361
      I'll be online from
        my dad's house.

 Hey, uh, try to find some more
        winter recipes!

06:06.800 --> 06:08.900

06:36.764 --> 06:38.296
     You seen all the signs
        on Main Street?

06:38.332 --> 06:39.598
      You are a rock star.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.966
    Endlessly embarrassing.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.001
     So, whatever happened
      to working forever?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.836
 Thought you were going to die
     on the 50-yard line.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.938

17:08.627 --> 17:09.794
           Samantha!

17:09.829 --> 17:11.596
   Get over here and hug me!

17:11.631 --> 17:13.131
 Miss Alice, how are you doing?

17:13.165 --> 17:15.165
    Oh, couldn't be better.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.135
    Oh, let me look at you.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.836
 I haven't seen you in so long.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.605
       I had to come back
     for my dad's ceremony,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.006
 I can't believe he's retiring.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.142
   Well, happens to all of us
        sooner or later.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.076
             Hmmm.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.611
     Really happy for him.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.679
    This place looks exactly
           the same.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.581
 Oh, your nook is still there.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.949
 But don't get too comfortable.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.951
      We're closing soon.

17:33.987 --> 17:35.319
 Why are you closing so early?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.588
  It's not early, not anymore.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.490
   We're only open for about
     four hours a day now.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.792
              Why?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.759
             Um...

17:41.795 --> 17:43.961
Things have been going downhill
         for a while.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.464
 We don't have enough money to
 buy books and new technology,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.766
     and... so the students
          don't come.

17:48.802 --> 17:52.303
    And... then we get even
         less funding.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.006
  This place was like a second
          home to me.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.941
 After my mom died, I came here
        every afternoon

17:56.976 --> 17:58.309
 while my dad was at practice.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.478
          I remember.

18:00.513 --> 18:04.082
    Sad to see it so empty.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.819
What about this one right here?

18:07.854 --> 18:10.521
    Is it my imagination or
  did this place get smaller?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.056
            [laughs]

18:12.092 --> 18:14.992
   I thought the same thing
  the first time I came back.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.528
         Oh, Samantha!

18:17.564 --> 18:19.163
   It has been way too long.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.164
             Yeah.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.299
            [laughs]

18:21.334 --> 18:23.367
    Have you noticed Graham
 still wears football jerseys?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.068
             I did.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.736
It's a good look on you, Graham.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.637
       You're killin' it.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.905
          Do you see?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.340
            [laughs]

18:29.375 --> 18:32.143
   She wasn't being serious,
            honey.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.045
             Nope.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.213
             Okay.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.481
    Oh... speaking of being
          serious...

18:36.516 --> 18:37.515
         [impatiently]
            Graham.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.583
    Can you please explain
   to my lovely wife, Diana,

18:38.618 --> 18:41.219
   that she can't be climbing
    ladders to decorate now?

18:41.254 --> 18:42.987
    Oh yeah, you absolutely
   can't be climbing ladders

18:43.022 --> 18:44.055
        to decorate now.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.223
        Don't be silly.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.225
         I'm pregnant,
       not incapacitated.

18:47.260 --> 18:47.925
       It doesn't matter.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.694
 He's right, it doesn't matter.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.462
      Stay off the ladder.

18:54.934 --> 18:58.436
  Yeah. Stay off the ladders,
             mom.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.171
           [chuckles]

19:00.206 --> 19:01.205
              Hmm.

19:06.045 --> 19:06.944
             Jake!

19:06.980 --> 19:08.112
            [laughs]

19:08.148 --> 19:09.247
              Hey.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.314
              Oh.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.450
      So good to see you,
            Diana.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.085
  Wow, this place got smaller,
           didn't it?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.186
             Right?

19:15.221 --> 19:17.255
What happened to staying at home
      and avoiding people.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.590
 Come on, you guys are friends,
          not people.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.825
       I feel comfortable
         in this town.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.794
    Have you met my husband,
            Graham?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.830
 Hey, nice to meet you, Graham.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.333
    Graham thinks it's nice
       to meet you too,

19:29.369 --> 19:31.702
   he's just having a bit of
       a fanboy moment.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.336
          No problem.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.671
   Hey, congrats on the baby.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.839
           Yeah. Yes.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.606
             Phew.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.607
            It's...

19:36.643 --> 19:37.375
            [laughs]

19:37.410 --> 19:38.543
           Thank you.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.610
           Uh, Jake.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.778
          It's a baby.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.880
        I'm gonna, uh,
    need this hand back....

19:42.916 --> 19:43.848
             Yeah.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.815
           [chuckles]

19:44.851 --> 19:48.019
    So, let's uh, let's get
      this thing started.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.687
     What can I do to help?

19:49.722 --> 19:54.125
     You can help Samantha
      with the streamers.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.493
             Okay.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.333
   Okay, so uh, what do I do?

20:02.368 --> 20:03.334
             Twist.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.902
           All right.

20:04.938 --> 20:08.005
     No... we can't both go
         the same way.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.340
              Oh.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.909
            No, uh.

20:11.945 --> 20:15.813
  Just, you start, and I'll go
   in the opposite direction.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.416
      Uh, you know there's
        a, uh, metaphor

20:18.451 --> 20:20.985
      for our relationship
          in all this.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.053
            [laughs]

20:22.088 --> 20:23.521
        Hey, Mrs. Wells.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.689
              Hey.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.190
    You kids aren't allowed
        to be in here,

20:26.226 --> 20:26.824
       we're decorating.

20:26.859 --> 20:27.758
             Oh...

20:27.794 --> 20:29.160
       <i> I know, I'm... I</i>
      <i> just had a question</i>

20:29.195 --> 20:29.994
  <i> about a reading assignment.</i>

20:30.029 --> 20:30.828
            <i> Please?</i>

20:30.863 --> 20:31.596
       This is supposed
       to be a surprise.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.064
       Okay, everyone out
          in the hall.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.666
           Everyone.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.434
        [clears throat]

20:36.469 --> 20:37.902
      You're not everyone.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.937
             Right.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.009
             Wha...

20:46.112 --> 20:48.212
  Well, this place is smaller
     than I remember, too.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.948
      Wow, how many times
   did we sneak in here, huh?

20:50.984 --> 20:51.649
              Hmm?

20:51.684 --> 20:55.253
I don't want to talk about that.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.255
  So, what are we doing hiding
          out in here?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.523
   You know, kids put their
 entire lives on social media.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.791
       Someone finds out
        I'm down here,

21:00.827 --> 21:04.262
  the, uh, press will descend.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.397
             Right.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.899
What am I doing hiding in here?

21:10.069 --> 21:12.737
       Look, Sam, I know
     that this is awkward.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.905
 Yeah, but I just wanted to be
  here for Coach's ceremony.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.374
  He was like a father figure
          to me when,

21:16.409 --> 21:19.210
uh... when I really needed one.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.444
       He loves you, too.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.747
  Means the world to him when
 you fly him all over the place

21:22.782 --> 21:24.548
          for a game.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.217
    Yeah, well I always seem
         to play better

21:26.252 --> 21:28.352
when I know he's in the stands.

21:30.590 --> 21:34.592
    Look, I don't want this
      to be hard for you.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.494
       This is important,

21:36.529 --> 21:38.963
 but it's more important to me
   that you're comfortable.

21:38.998 --> 21:43.167
  So, if you think it's better
       that I go, I will.

21:43.202 --> 21:46.504
         Just tell me.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.573
    Just tell me to go, Sam.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.842
             Stay.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.080
  It's good that you're here.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.550
After all, it's your Snowcoming,
              too.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.585
           Thank you.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.455
     I'm sorry if I've been
         acting weird.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.390
        I mean, it's...
     it's ancient history,

22:06.426 --> 22:08.426
      we've both obviously
           moved on.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.761
        Coast is clear.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.296
     I've locked the doors.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.633
  Now, come help me decorate!

22:15.668 --> 22:17.101
             Right.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.215
         Ooh, ooh, hey.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.784
 Are you sure you don't want me
          to get that?

22:33.820 --> 22:34.752
      Well, what you lack
        in arms' length

22:34.787 --> 22:37.355
     you definitely make up
      for in stubbornness.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.792
            [groans]

22:41.828 --> 22:43.427
             Done.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.562
              See?

22:44.597 --> 22:45.496
             Yeah.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.764
    Care... ah, ah, careful.

22:50.036 --> 22:50.935
            [sighs]

22:50.970 --> 22:52.670
        We do good work.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.806
  It would have taken me days
   to do this all by myself.

22:55.842 --> 22:56.807
           Thank you.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.342
     [laughs] Well, that's
     what friends are for.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.443
              Hmm.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.911
  Well guys, I'm heading home.
     I gotta put dinner on.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.413
   You, stay off the ladders.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.315
        You, hurry home.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.083
         You, see you
        in the morning.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.853
Yeah. I'm lookin' forward to it.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.189
  Did he just say he's heading
     home to put dinner on?

23:12.225 --> 23:13.858
      That's what I heard.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.259
              Hmm.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.360
What are you two doing tomorrow?

23:16.396 --> 23:17.228
              Hmm?

23:17.263 --> 23:20.030
    Oh, you know, just going
         out for a run.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.265
           Together.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.366
        Like friends do.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.035
  You know, good friends like
     Jake Gillette and me.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.137
         [smacks lips]

23:26.172 --> 23:27.104
            Graham.

23:27.140 --> 23:28.706
  Yeah, I'm just going to take
        these boxes back

23:28.741 --> 23:30.040
       to your classroom.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.542
           [strains]

23:31.577 --> 23:32.810
        Oh, here we go.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.911
           Thank you.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.882
      So, Jake looks good.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.351
 Jake looked good before he was
    a professional athlete,

23:40.386 --> 23:42.787
and don't look at me like that.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.222
 Clearly, he still has feelings
            for you.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.725
   You can see it every time
       he looks at you.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.826
        Can I be blunt?

23:48.861 --> 23:51.328
You are literally never subtle.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.799
I can be around Jake right now,
      for my dad's sake,

23:54.834 --> 23:56.233
         but that's it.

23:56.269 --> 23:59.069
   There's nothing going on,
     there never will be.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.205
       He broke my heart.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.874
   He doesn't get a do-over.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.976

32:38.524 --> 32:41.625
I'm gonna have to tell everyone
   for the next 60-70 years

32:41.660 --> 32:44.061
     that I beat, uh, big
 Jake Gillette in a foot race.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.429
            [laughs]

32:45.464 --> 32:47.931
          No problem.

32:47.967 --> 32:53.170
 So, anyway, uh, well Sam and I
  both lost our moms early on.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.906
      The difference was,
        Sam had Coach.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.141
         My dad, well,

32:58.177 --> 33:00.243
  I was just a little too much
       for him to handle,

33:00.279 --> 33:05.282
  so he left me with his mom,
           my nana.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.952
  And then at football camp,
I just... I latched onto coach.

33:08.988 --> 33:12.489
 Of course, I fell immediately
    in love with Samantha.

33:12.524 --> 33:16.760
 Took me ten years to convince
     her to love me back.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.997
 Three years to mess it all up.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.832
     Well, what about now?

33:21.867 --> 33:23.000
        What about now?

33:23.035 --> 33:25.802
  I mean, she's made it pretty
   clear that she's moved on.

33:25.838 --> 33:29.573
Well, sure, but, um, I know for
a fact she's not seeing anyone.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.783
             Hello.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.685
      Are... are you okay?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.086
             Yeah.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.956
              Hi.

33:45.991 --> 33:46.857
         I'm Samantha.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.025
             Sage.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.559
            Hi Sage.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.727
     What are you reading?

33:50.763 --> 33:51.628
 Uh, it's for freshman English.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.897
   We have to read a new book
          every month.

33:53.932 --> 33:54.998
       You don't like it?

33:55.034 --> 33:55.999
        It's a classic.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.267
    It's classically boring.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.370
 I'm halfway through, and it's
all about getting some rich guy

34:00.406 --> 34:03.473
      to be your husband,
      so you're well-off.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.009
        Yeah well, times
      were different then.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.210
What kind of books do you like?

34:07.246 --> 34:08.645
            I don't.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.547
     Okay, well, what kind
     of movies do you like?

34:10.581 --> 34:13.083
   Adventure, fantasy worlds,
           you know,

34:13.118 --> 34:14.985
     weird stuff like that.

34:15.020 --> 34:18.422
    That's not weird at all,
   I actually love those too.

34:18.456 --> 34:23.527
People created entire worlds and
 invited you to come and visit.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.163
        Here, try these.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.431
        I love them all.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.665
              Hmm.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.333
        Come on, give me
         that top one.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.271
             Look.

34:34.306 --> 34:37.274
  See, there is my name right
  there from where I took out

34:37.309 --> 34:38.442
       this actual book.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.877
       Yikes, that's like
         50 years ago.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.012
          I'm kidding.

34:42.047 --> 34:42.846
          I'm kidding.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.380
            Hm-mmm.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.216
             Okay.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.418
         I'll try them.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.587
 I mean, it can't be worse than

34:50.621 --> 34:56.659
    "gazing into the garden,
  dreaming of a man of means."

35:09.575 --> 35:10.607

35:10.642 --> 35:11.875
 Oh, don't scare me like that.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.110
            [laughs]

35:13.145 --> 35:15.545
  I need you to come with me.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.546
          What? Where?

35:16.582 --> 35:17.614
       Come on, let's go.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.248

35:18.283 --> 35:19.082
             Oh...

35:19.118 --> 35:19.749
            Come on.

35:19.785 --> 35:20.851
         But I... Okay.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.319
   Come on, come on, come on.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.721
    So you're kidnapping me?

35:24.756 --> 35:25.555
              Yes.

35:25.591 --> 35:26.923
           For lunch.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.125
         That's right.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.861
   Should I, uh, should I be
leaving a trail of breadcrumbs?

35:30.896 --> 35:31.761
             Maybe.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.531
            [laughs]

35:34.566 --> 35:36.967
  I forgot about these woods.

35:37.002 --> 35:39.903
  Happy to see that every tree
  is exactly where I left it.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.239
        Yeah, I love it.

35:42.274 --> 35:45.542
        Come back here
       whenever I visit.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.478
    I didn't know you came
   to visit my dad so often.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.213
Well, I think Coach didn't know
      how to bring it up

35:50.249 --> 35:52.215
  without upsetting you, so...

35:52.251 --> 35:54.284
         In accordance
      with the male rules

35:54.319 --> 35:55.619
      for avoiding awkward
         conversations,

35:55.654 --> 35:57.721
          he just, uh,
      didn't say anything.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.189
              Oh.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.126
             Yeah.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.995
             Yeah.

36:05.030 --> 36:07.631
Our first kiss, under that tree.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.599
      A million years ago.

36:09.635 --> 36:13.470
          Yeah. What?

36:13.505 --> 36:17.073
  It's weird, I remember every
  detail about our first kiss.

36:17.109 --> 36:18.475
         Yeah, me too.

36:18.510 --> 36:23.180
   I don't remember anything
     about our last kiss.

36:23.215 --> 36:27.250
     Maybe that's because
    it hasn't happened yet.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.258
              Hmm.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.263
            [laughs]

36:40.299 --> 36:43.033
     Is that our treehouse?

36:43.068 --> 36:44.134
   What have you done to it?

36:44.169 --> 36:47.704
Well, last time I was visiting,
      Coach and I gave it

36:47.739 --> 36:49.372
    a, uh, little facelift.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.007
           Facelift?

36:51.043 --> 36:53.443
     It's like you rebuilt
       the whole thing.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.920
            [laughs]

37:05.657 --> 37:08.024
    There's a picnic basket
           up here.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.026
      Well, that would be
        the lunch part.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.262
            [laughs]

37:22.007 --> 37:23.640
        A winter picnic.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.608
        It's different.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.576
  Well, you know, I've always
         been a rebel.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.478
            [laughs]

37:28.513 --> 37:29.913
 I stopped by the school today.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.148
   Miss Alice said Dad loved
       the decorations.

37:32.184 --> 37:34.651
        Good. I'm glad.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.386
  Wanna hear something weird?

37:36.421 --> 37:37.220
            Always.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.189
     I met this girl there
          named Sage.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.258
       That's not weird,
      Sage is a nice name.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.359
             Stop.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.427
            [laughs]

37:44.463 --> 37:48.732
  Sage needed a... a book for
  class but she hates reading.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.600
        Also, not weird.

37:50.636 --> 37:54.371
    Slightly tragic, but...
            Sorry.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.071
             Go on.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.873
 So I recommended a few books,

37:56.908 --> 37:59.109
      and we were looking
     at the checkout card,

37:59.144 --> 38:01.044
     and my name was still
        on one of them.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.946
  Okay, tha... that is weird.

38:02.981 --> 38:03.847
             Right?

38:03.882 --> 38:04.848
             Yeah.

38:04.883 --> 38:05.649
    I mean, there were only
    four names on the card,

38:05.684 --> 38:06.516
      and these are really
          good books.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.285
    People really should be
         reading them.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.220
       And they haven't,
        not for years.

38:10.255 --> 38:12.956
       So I was thinking
      about what you said,

38:12.991 --> 38:14.924
       about going back
       to the beginning.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
   So, what are you thinking?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.128
         I don't know.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.296
     I mean, with my work,

38:19.331 --> 38:20.864
     I... I have all these
          connections

38:20.899 --> 38:22.732
       with these amazing
      young adult authors.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.368
   Most of them self-publish,
 because traditional publishing

38:25.404 --> 38:28.471
    companies like mine are
   too afraid to take a risk.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.774
  I was wondering if there was
     some way that I could,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.142
         I don't know,
      bring them together.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.310
            Ahhh...

38:33.345 --> 38:36.446
 Like if there wasn't strength
   in numbers or something.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.448
I don't know, I'm still thinking
           about it.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.984
   In the meantime, I should
 probably get back to the house

38:41.019 --> 38:43.253
     and do some real work.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.321
             Right.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.024
      and he's a machine
    when it comes to money,

41:01.059 --> 41:02.692
        which is great.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.196
 But, I just find myself stuck
 in my apartment and my hotel

41:06.231 --> 41:09.032
 because I... can't even go out
       to buy a sandwich

41:09.067 --> 41:10.867
 without drawing a huge crowd.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.735
    And, he's positioning me
     to do even more of it.

41:12.771 --> 41:15.772
      You know, TV spots,
         commercials.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.509
        [simultaneously]
             Clink!

41:20.745 --> 41:23.880
I know this should be my dream,
         but it isn't.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.815
 I feel like your dad's trying
  to coach me one last time,

41:25.851 --> 41:30.220
 to know when to close one book
       and open the next.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.821
    Wait, what did you say?

41:31.857 --> 41:34.224
 Okay, I used the book metaphor
        to impress you.

41:34.259 --> 41:34.924
         No, not that.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.893
 Before that, about the crowds.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.328
      Always, everywhere.

41:38.363 --> 41:39.496
            [laughs]

41:39.531 --> 41:40.430
      I gotta call Diana.

41:40.465 --> 41:41.397
        We've gotta go.

41:41.433 --> 41:42.732
           To where?

41:42.767 --> 41:44.734
        To the library.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.072
   I'm not sure what you mean
            by that.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.807
          [laughing]
          I'm joking.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.442
            Oh, my.

41:52.477 --> 41:56.446
    Oh, you're both... here.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.781
Uh, yeah, I uh, I was just doing
        some cleaning up

41:58.817 --> 41:59.983
    in my classroom, and...

42:00.018 --> 42:00.683
             Jake!

42:00.719 --> 42:02.685
 Oh my, I didn't see you there.

42:02.721 --> 42:03.953
             Gosh!

42:03.989 --> 42:04.821
     It's great to see ya.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.155
      Good to see you too.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.457
           All right.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.625
 Why'd we all get the SOS text?

42:08.660 --> 42:11.694
   Well, this library was my
  favourite place in the world

42:11.730 --> 42:12.662
          growing up.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.264
  You know, that's not exactly
         breaking news.

42:14.299 --> 42:15.231
         [all laughing]

42:15.267 --> 42:17.166
    Hurts my heart to see it
      sitting here empty.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.002
      So that's why I need
           your help.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.671
      We're gonna restore
         the library.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.875
  That's a great idea, but...

42:25.911 --> 42:27.944
   But what are you thinking?

42:27.979 --> 42:30.013
We're gonna have an open house.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.614
             Ohhh!

42:34.252 --> 42:36.786
   Before the Snow Bowl game.

42:36.821 --> 42:38.187
              Ah!

42:38.223 --> 42:40.189
Like an indoor tailgating party.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.992
   We'll have hot chocolate,
   and food before the game.

42:43.028 --> 42:43.927
            Okay...

42:43.962 --> 42:46.729
   We'll spruce the place up,
        we can decorate.

42:46.765 --> 42:47.697
        Yeah, you know,

42:47.732 --> 42:49.365
    I know where we can get
     some streamers, too.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.301
Oh, yeah, I heard what happened
      to your classroom.

42:51.336 --> 42:52.869
         That's weird.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.572
  We can get some new pillows,
    put up some new posters,

42:55.607 --> 42:58.074
    and we'll take donations
       at the front door.

42:58.109 --> 43:00.977
Ah, it's... it's a lovely idea,
            honey.

43:01.012 --> 43:03.146
     Um, I just don't think
        a tailgate party

43:03.181 --> 43:04.914
     at the library sounds
        like much fun.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.817
         But how does
  "Tailgate with Jake" sound?

43:07.852 --> 43:08.952
              Mmm.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.222
    If you're okay with it.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.024
          No pressure.

43:15.060 --> 43:19.996
     So, you want me to use
       my power for good?

43:20.031 --> 43:21.064
       Eh, yeah, why not?

43:21.099 --> 43:21.764
            Really?

43:21.800 --> 43:22.966
 If you think people will come.

43:23.001 --> 43:25.535
  Yes, they will come, because
  you're asking them to come,

43:25.570 --> 43:26.736
because you're a hometown hero,

43:26.771 --> 43:31.908
  and if you say the library's
  important, they'll be here.

43:31.943 --> 43:33.109
      She's right, I mean,

43:33.144 --> 43:34.243
       I'll even show up
       the night before

43:34.279 --> 43:35.511
  just to make sure I get in.

43:35.547 --> 43:36.412
     Well, how about this?

43:36.448 --> 43:38.715
       Every $5 donated
     gets a raffle ticket,

43:38.750 --> 43:40.416
      we'll pull a raffle
       at the Snow Bowl,

43:40.452 --> 43:42.852
    and the winner will get
   a football signed by Coach

43:42.887 --> 43:44.354
        and yours truly.

43:44.389 --> 43:45.188
         That's great.

43:45.223 --> 43:46.189
            [laughs]

43:46.224 --> 43:46.956
       This is wonderful.

43:46.992 --> 43:50.126
        Okay, so Boss,
       when do we start?

43:50.161 --> 43:51.194
           Right now.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.729
    Diana, do you think you
   could come up with a flyer

43:52.764 --> 43:54.263
    for the event and put it
         all over town,

43:54.299 --> 43:55.365
         especially in
        the storefronts?

43:55.400 --> 43:56.099
         I can do that.

43:56.134 --> 43:56.966
             Great.

43:57.002 --> 43:57.867
         And Graham...

43:57.902 --> 43:58.768
  Do you think you could write
           an article

43:58.803 --> 43:59.869
       for the newspaper

43:59.904 --> 44:01.070
  and maybe get them to put it
     on their website, too?

44:01.106 --> 44:02.138
          I am on it.

44:02.173 --> 44:04.240
  And the rest of us, come on.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.042
       We got work to do.

44:13.785 --> 44:17.286
  He gave up endorsement money
           for this?!

44:21.693 --> 44:24.327
       Looks like we're
       going tailgating.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.261
             Okay.

44:25.296 --> 44:26.229
      I am gonna head home

44:26.264 --> 44:28.231
  and make a dozen new pillows
         for the nook,

44:28.266 --> 44:30.233
      perfect use for all
      my leftover fabric.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.934
    And I'm going shopping,
     I got hot chocolate,

44:31.970 --> 44:34.437
        hot dogs, buns,
      mustard and relish,

44:34.472 --> 44:35.471
       I can handle this.

44:35.507 --> 44:37.407
      And I make a great
  vegetable soup we can sell.

44:37.442 --> 44:38.341
     I'll text you my list.

44:38.376 --> 44:39.909
            Perfect.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.679
         Let me guess,

44:42.714 --> 44:45.314
       "50 Hot Soups for
     a Cold Winters' Day?"

44:46.351 --> 44:48.151
   How many of our cookbooks
       have you bought?

44:48.186 --> 44:50.653
         [embarrassed]
         All of them.

44:50.689 --> 44:51.521
           Seriously?

44:51.556 --> 44:52.989
        Yeah, of course,
    they're yours, you know?

44:53.024 --> 44:54.624
    I wanted to support you.

44:54.659 --> 44:55.525
              Wow.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.492
    You know, and you joke,

44:56.528 --> 44:57.560
  but there's a lobster bisque
        recipe in there

44:57.595 --> 44:59.529
     that a freight train
  would take a dirt road for.

44:59.564 --> 45:03.833
  [laughs] What? I don't even
     know what that means.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.768
         But you know,
        once we do this,

45:05.804 --> 45:07.937
  the whole world's gonna know
          you're here.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.172
      No more hiding out.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.606
        I'll just escape
        to my treehouse.

45:10.642 --> 45:11.874
  They'll never find me there.

45:11.910 --> 45:12.975
              Aww.

45:13.011 --> 45:16.112
         [phone buzzes]

45:16.147 --> 45:16.846
             Um...

45:16.881 --> 45:18.014
        Umm, excuse me.

45:21.519 --> 45:22.852
        [clears throat]

45:22.887 --> 45:23.619
             Hello?

45:23.655 --> 45:24.387
         <i> Jake, buddy.</i>

45:24.422 --> 45:25.221
             Lenny.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.989
   I thought you were taking
           a break.

45:27.025 --> 45:28.124
      Wow, that was fast.

45:28.159 --> 45:30.493
    I get it, you want to do
 something for your old school.

45:30.528 --> 45:31.961
       Let me work on how
         to spin this.

45:31.996 --> 45:33.396
       There's no "spin,"
             Lenny.

45:33.431 --> 45:35.064
     It's for a good cause
      and I'm having fun.

45:35.100 --> 45:35.898
              Fun?

45:35.934 --> 45:37.066
           Yeah, fun.

45:37.102 --> 45:37.967
    Jake, this is your life.

45:38.002 --> 45:40.870
      You're not supposed
       to be having fun.

45:40.905 --> 45:41.938
       [under his breath]
           Oh, my...

45:43.441 --> 45:45.842
  That didn't come out the way
      it was supposed to.

45:45.877 --> 45:46.642
             Lenny?

45:46.678 --> 45:47.543
       Yeah, Jake buddy?

45:47.579 --> 45:48.745
       Everything's good.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.379
     Don't worry about it.

45:50.415 --> 45:51.314
         But I just...

45:51.349 --> 45:52.014
          [call drops]

45:52.050 --> 45:54.083
           Aw, Jake.

45:54.119 --> 45:55.351
          [loud slam]

46:02.260 --> 46:03.760
         There you are.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.161
              Oh.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.367
   I love that you organized
           all this.

46:11.402 --> 46:14.203
  Well, it's easy when you're
  doing something you enjoy.

46:14.239 --> 46:16.539
              Mm.

46:16.574 --> 46:18.775
     I can't do cookbooks,
             Jake.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.610
          Not anymore.

46:20.645 --> 46:22.211
            I know.

46:22.247 --> 46:24.213
    You found your passion,
       it's right here.

46:24.249 --> 46:26.549
       It's this library.

46:26.584 --> 46:28.184
    I mean, maybe I couldn't
       find it out there

46:28.219 --> 46:32.755
   because it was right here
all along, just waiting for me.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.691
I have to do something more than
  a tailgating party, though.

46:35.727 --> 46:38.094
There's gotta be something else.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.362
             Hello?

46:39.397 --> 46:40.696
      I saw the light on.

46:40.732 --> 46:41.731
             Oh...

46:45.804 --> 46:46.769
        Oh, you're here.

46:46.805 --> 46:47.970
           I'm here.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.071
     So what's the verdict?

46:49.107 --> 46:49.906
        They're awesome.

46:49.941 --> 46:50.973
     When Calinda summoned
          the dragon?

46:51.009 --> 46:53.309
   Right. And she doesn't see
     that Xerxes is there?

46:53.344 --> 46:54.577
          I was dying.

46:54.612 --> 46:56.245
 This is my kind of love story.

46:56.281 --> 46:57.146
   <i> Wanna know the best part?</i>

46:57.182 --> 46:58.214
             <i> What?</i>

46:58.249 --> 47:00.650
 Each one of those is the first
       book in a series.

47:00.685 --> 47:01.651
        Are you kidding?

47:01.686 --> 47:03.653
   Nope, this is one of five,
       that's a trilogy,

47:03.688 --> 47:05.321
         and this one,
    there's like 15 of them,

47:05.356 --> 47:06.556
and the author is still writing.

47:06.591 --> 47:07.657
              15?

47:07.692 --> 47:08.891
   I can't wait to read them.

47:08.927 --> 47:10.827
<i> They just keep getting better,</i>
             <i> too.</i>

47:10.862 --> 47:12.762
     <i> Seven's my favourite.</i>

47:17.368 --> 47:19.802
   Wow, Diana really papered
           the town.

47:21.139 --> 47:22.572
             <i> Yeah.</i>

47:22.607 --> 47:24.907
 Hey, you, uh, mind if we take
        a little detour

47:24.943 --> 47:26.442
  before we go to the bonfire?

47:26.477 --> 47:27.643
             Sure.

47:34.819 --> 47:36.252
             Ahh...

47:36.287 --> 47:38.654
       Nana's old house.
         Looks great.

47:38.690 --> 47:40.957

         a little girl

47:42.460 --> 47:44.927

      I was a skinny kid

48:14.726 --> 48:17.460
who couldn't sit still for more
       than 20 seconds.

48:17.495 --> 48:18.861
   They put a football helmet
             on me

48:18.897 --> 48:21.397

       a bobble-head toy.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.138
   that Coach had called Nana

48:29.173 --> 48:36.679
 and suggested that I come out
     to camp, at no cost.

48:36.714 --> 48:40.383
       Maybe he saw your
        natural talent.

48:40.418 --> 48:42.084
              Nah.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.853

    a kindness for a woman

48:43.888 --> 48:47.890
        in a tough spot.

 the whole program in the city.

           are great,

57:27.244 --> 57:28.644
      So, I was thinking
     about all the authors

57:28.679 --> 57:30.045
      that I've contacted
         through work.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.580
        The ones who are
        self-publishing.

57:31.615 --> 57:32.648
            Mm-hmm.

57:32.683 --> 57:33.749
     And I thought, what if
   they would give one or two

57:33.784 --> 57:36.785
  of their books to libraries,
     at a discounted rate?

57:36.821 --> 57:38.320
    Like, super discounted.

57:38.355 --> 57:39.888
     So, I targeted all of
          the authors

57:39.924 --> 57:41.056
   that I knew wrote series,

57:41.091 --> 57:42.958
        and I asked them
    for just the first book,

57:42.993 --> 57:44.393
      for our library and
      for other libraries.

57:44.428 --> 57:45.360
    Because, if a kid loves
            a book,

57:45.396 --> 57:46.628
     they're gonna read it
     over and over again.

57:46.664 --> 57:48.997
 And, they're going to buy all
 the other books in the series,

57:49.033 --> 57:52.501
 which is a win for the author,
     but also a win for us.

57:52.536 --> 57:55.037
   I just want to see if any
   of them emailed me back.

57:59.210 --> 58:00.409
            [laughs]

58:00.444 --> 58:04.046
Sam, it looks like some of them
 definitely emailed you back.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.583
            [laughs]

58:16.927 --> 58:18.393
         Look at this.

58:18.429 --> 58:19.962
      I've got 200 authors
      who are interested.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.864
    So, if we make money at
  the tailgate party tomorrow,

58:21.899 --> 58:23.966
 that means we might be able to
 buy one book from each of them

58:24.001 --> 58:25.067
    at the discounted rate.

58:25.102 --> 58:26.134
             Nice.

58:26.170 --> 58:27.269
  Plus, I've been reaching out
      to other libraries,

58:27.304 --> 58:29.271
   and they all want in too,
   'cause they're all having

58:29.306 --> 58:30.239
       the same problems
         that we have.

58:30.274 --> 58:31.373
     They've got no money,

58:31.408 --> 58:33.242
and the donations that they are
     getting are terrible.

58:33.277 --> 58:34.877
      I mean, they've got
     40-year-old textbooks,

58:34.912 --> 58:36.445
        paperbacks that
       are missing pages,

58:36.480 --> 58:39.314
      and magazines so old
    that they're speculating

58:39.350 --> 58:41.483
     whether Charles and Di
  are having marital problems.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.986
 So, what I think I need to do
 is just make a list of people

58:44.021 --> 58:45.220
      that I think cou...

58:46.657 --> 58:48.223
  Why am I dressed like this?

58:49.493 --> 58:51.793
            [grunts]

58:51.829 --> 58:53.262
            [laughs]

58:56.133 --> 58:58.267
           [laughter]

58:58.302 --> 59:01.570
      Ah, you were right,
      this is cathartic.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.138
            [laughs]

59:07.478 --> 59:10.145
             What?

59:10.180 --> 59:12.247
       I miss that laugh.

59:16.620 --> 59:19.288
   I miss being with someone
      who makes me laugh.

59:23.561 --> 59:24.793
           All right.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.196
           All right.

59:28.232 --> 59:30.132
       I gotta go make my
       world-famous soup.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.366
          You comin'?

59:31.402 --> 59:32.668
      Only 'cause there's
      nothing I like more

59:32.703 --> 59:34.269
         than watching
       someone else cook.

59:34.305 --> 59:36.138
 Let's see how much you like it
    when I leave the dishes

59:36.173 --> 59:37.339
       for you to clean.

59:37.374 --> 59:38.140
             What?

59:38.175 --> 59:39.374
          No. I am not
      signing up for that.

59:39.410 --> 59:40.208
            [laughs]

59:40.244 --> 59:41.410
            Come on.

59:45.516 --> 59:48.183
         [phone rings]

59:48.218 --> 59:48.951
              Hey.

59:48.986 --> 59:50.052
             <i> Hey.</i>

59:50.087 --> 59:55.223
So, anything you want to tell me
      about Jake and you?

59:55.259 --> 59:56.358
             Nope.

59:56.393 --> 59:57.526
            Nothing?

59:57.561 --> 59:59.027
        Nothing to tell.

59:59.063 --> 01:00:01.196
   <i> Girl, the lies you tell.</i>

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:04.900
Anyway, listen, the whole school
        is buzzing about

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:05.801
 Snowcoming Tailgate with Jake,

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.903
     <i> so make sure he makes</i>
        <i> loads of soup.</i>

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.739
      I think we're going
          to be okay.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:11.573
     <i> And whatever your dad</i>
         <i> is grilling,</i>

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:13.742
     <i> tell him to get twice</i>
           <i> as much.</i>

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:14.643
           I'm on it.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.411
      And, what did you do
       to Sage Abernathy?

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:17.846
             Sage?

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:18.513
            Nothing.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:19.648
           <i> Nothing?</i>

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:20.649
        <i> Three days ago,</i>

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.085
  Sage wouldn't read the back
       of a cereal box.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.355
 Yesterday, I had to physically
  take her book away from her

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.557
 <i> so she would stop reading it</i>
       <i> under the desk.</i>

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:29.925
     She's an awesome kid.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.693
 <i> And you're an awesome mentor.</i>

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:34.830
    Sage is the first kid in
    your literacy campaign.

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:36.498
         Student No. 1.

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:37.332
              Wow.

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:39.034
       Pretty cool, huh?

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.502
     Yeah, actually, it is.

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:42.204
       Talk to you later.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:43.672
           Okay, bye.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.412
            [laughs]

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.751
  Your soup smells very good,

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.753
 but we're going to need a lot
     of people to show up

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:59.755
 or we're going to be eating it
          for a month.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.923
  Oh, there's gonna be so many
 people we're going to run out.

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:02.924
           You watch.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.526
             Okay.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:06.928
     So, I was able to find
        graham crackers.

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:08.397
             Nice.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.798
       And marshmallows,

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.800
     though I have no idea
      how old these are.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.468
     You know the half-life
      is a hundred years.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:14.436
             True.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:15.604
            [laughs]

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.139
      Got a chocolate bar.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.041
        Ooh, did you...

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:21.910
    Why would you doubt me?

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:25.580
  For the man who likes peanut
  butter cups in his s'mores.

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:26.548
           Told you.

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.383
          I'm a rebel.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:29.418
             Here.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.519
           Thank you.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.120
         There you go.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.355
           Thank you.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.459
              So.

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:39.127
Can I tell you something crazy?

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.463
  Crazier than us sitting here
     making s'mores again?

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:42.597
           [chuckles]

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:46.234
 Yeah, even crazier than that.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.470
            Tell me.

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:51.940
       Well, my contract
       is up this year,

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:54.743
      and I don't know if
   they're going to keep me,

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:57.913
    trade me, or completely
         cut me loose.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:58.947
        Are you kidding?

01:01:58.982 --> 01:01:59.748
             Nope.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.016
       You're at the peak
        of your career.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.117
   Why would they trade you?

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:05.487
Peak or not, I am getting older.

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:07.456
           I'm tired.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.191
       Tired of football.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.193
   Never thought I'd hear you
           say that.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.428
  I... I still love the game,
        I will forever,

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:18.033
  but uh, you know, my body's
        getting tired.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:21.303
  I make those old man noises
 when I get up in the morning.

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.171
            [laughs]

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:25.173
    I took a really hard hit
           last year.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.242
      Oh yeah, I saw that.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.979
  What? I was channel surfing.

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:32.714
 I just... happened to see it.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.817
            Uh-huh?

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:39.788
   Anyway, it freaked me out
         a little bit.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.623
            I dunno.

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:45.293
  Thinking about walking away.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:48.730
          Really? You?

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.966
     I know. Insane, right?

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:56.071
    But, when I allow myself
     to consider the idea,

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.907
       I really like it.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.742
  I want to leave on my terms,
           you know?

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.344
          My decision.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:08.483
 I don't want to be a piece in
  someone else's chess board.

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:11.353
You still like your marshmallow
        crispy, right?

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:12.487
           Of course.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:13.955
             Good.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:17.058
            Oooooh.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:17.993
            For you.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.461
           Thank you.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:25.467
         There you go.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:29.905
       To new beginnings.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.439
       To starting over.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.074
        [simultaneously]
             Clink.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.512
              Mmm.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.147
         Right there,
        that's perfect.

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.516
  And all the lighter colours,
    let's put on that there.

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:44.186
       It's looking good,
           you guys.

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:47.189
       Okay, let's get it
         together here.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:04:00.602
       [crowd chattering]

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:03.004
            [laughs]

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.074
       I got your text,
       what's happening?

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:07.976
  I don't know, we got a call
  from Miss Alice to come now

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.344
     and use the back door.

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:15.584
         What's wrong?

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:16.952
             Look.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.758
     We need to get set up
          right away.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.026
              <i> Oh.</i>

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:27.562
        Maybe we should
        open up early.

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:28.430
          Absolutely.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:29.664
         Dad, hot dogs.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.266
     Graham, can you set up
       the drink station?

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:33.068
    Miss Alice, can you get
       the soup prepped?

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.836
  Diana, let's get the raffle
         table set up.

tell me that they only liked me

    Um, I'll think about it.

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:43.944
             Okay.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.212
     Don't think too long.

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:49.416
 Just maybe say yes and make us
           all happy.

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:50.785
              Yes.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.854
        Yes, yes, yes!
        Yes, of course!

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:54.622
           Thank you!

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:55.756
            Awesome!

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:58.526
 Oh, and, uh, one other thing.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.895
       You know, for, uh,
          a long time,

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.864
  it's been you and me against
           the world,

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.534
     and I'm really proud
  of the woman you've become,

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:07.968
       and I'm, you know
         I just think

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:11.071
    you've been a wonderful
           daughter.

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:14.742
   But wouldn't you know it,
  I fell in love with this...

01:20:14.777 --> 01:20:18.279
     this wonderful woman.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:21.715
  We're going to get married.

01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:24.652
    I can't believe you two.

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:28.389
  I can't believe it took you
     this long to tell me.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:29.256
            [laughs]

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:30.257
           You knew?

01:20:30.293 --> 01:20:30.958
       Of course I knew.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:32.393
You guys aren't exactly subtle.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:35.663
 I'm so happy for both of you.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:36.597
  Can I help plan the wedding?

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:39.300
     Oh yes, and please be
      my Maid of Honour.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.302
     Of course, of course.
