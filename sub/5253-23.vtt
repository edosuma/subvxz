WEBVTT

00:01.758 --> 00:03.429
Whenever something important happens,

00:03.453 --> 00:05.289
you're the first person
I wanna talk to about it.

00:05.314 --> 00:06.569
How did he know how to find me?

00:06.594 --> 00:07.860
He texted me looking for you.

00:07.862 --> 00:09.881
If he doesn't like the real you,

00:09.906 --> 00:11.096
maybe he isn't worth it.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.678
You always wanted to get into SCU.

00:12.703 --> 00:13.687
Dean Strauss loves your stuff,

00:13.712 --> 00:15.210
and he wants you to
come in for an interview.

00:15.688 --> 00:17.156
Luke had gotten me an interview

00:17.158 --> 00:19.058
with the dean of the
English department.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.123
SCU had been my dream school,
and I was beyond excited

00:22.148 --> 00:24.241
to have a second
chance to come here.

00:24.266 --> 00:25.965
Their creative writing program

00:25.967 --> 00:28.268
was one of the best
in the country,

00:28.270 --> 00:30.536
and I was trying to
remain calm and confident,

00:30.538 --> 00:32.104
which was a challenge

00:32.107 --> 00:34.374
given that they had
already rejected me once.

00:34.376 --> 00:36.515
You nervous? You
really don't need to be.

00:36.531 --> 00:38.131
No, I'm not vernous.

00:38.156 --> 00:40.222
Nervous. I'm not nervous.

00:40.224 --> 00:42.311
The truth was, my
stomach was in my throat

00:42.336 --> 00:44.358
and I had already
peed three times.

00:44.383 --> 00:46.317
Dean Strauss already likes your writing,

00:46.319 --> 00:48.152
and you know exactly what
to say in the interview.

00:48.153 --> 00:49.686
I think you got a great shot,

00:49.688 --> 00:51.821
and I'll be right outside waiting.

00:51.823 --> 00:53.389
And I think...

00:53.391 --> 00:54.824
I need to make another pit stop.

00:54.826 --> 00:56.025
And you'll know exactly where

00:56.027 --> 00:57.773
all the bathrooms are on campus.

00:57.798 --> 01:00.496
Luke was right. I did
have a great shot.

01:00.498 --> 01:03.333
I just had to focus on
sounding smart and charming

01:03.335 --> 01:06.269
and ambitious and hungry
all at the same time.

01:06.271 --> 01:08.404
I wouldn't let my
nerves distract me.

01:08.406 --> 01:10.907
I wouldn't let
anything distract me,

01:10.909 --> 01:14.143
not even that girl's amazing
gladiator sandal boots.

01:14.145 --> 01:15.978
How did she lace those things up?

01:15.980 --> 01:18.448
Wait. I had to keep it together.

01:21.853 --> 01:24.354
You belong here.

01:24.356 --> 01:27.490
I'm not so sure about that.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.969
You do realize this is
the men's room, right?

Showtime.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.117
Well, so far, the
receptionist seemed nice,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.542
and such a comfy office.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.178
I was feeling good about it.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.546
Oh.

01:59.914 --> 02:02.020
Well, nice to see you again.

02:02.507 --> 02:05.557
Um, I was just looking
through your pictures.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.227
It's nice to see you again.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.975
I am Jenna Hamilton,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.428
and I am confident that SCU will provide

02:12.453 --> 02:15.678
the most enriching learning
experience possible.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.467
And I am confident

02:17.492 --> 02:21.561
that you are one of the
more interesting candidates

02:21.563 --> 02:22.829
I'll be seeing this round.

02:27.602 --> 02:30.265
Oh, isn't that your friend
Sadie from the clambake?

02:31.156 --> 02:33.461
I don't want to talk about it.

02:33.703 --> 02:35.241
So what do you want to talk about?

02:35.243 --> 02:37.143
Me? Nothing.

02:37.145 --> 02:39.579
Okay, uh, that's cool.

02:39.581 --> 02:40.613
Cool.

02:40.615 --> 02:41.585
It's just that you said

02:41.610 --> 02:42.710
you wanted to talk
to me about something.

02:42.735 --> 02:45.602
Okay, just TBH, it's
feeling a little naggy.

02:46.221 --> 02:50.056
Jus... okay, I'm... I'm poor.

02:50.058 --> 02:53.126
I don't even have enough money
to afford the lobster Cobb,

02:53.128 --> 02:55.061
which is what I'm
dying for... I need that

02:55.063 --> 02:57.097
bourgie-buttered-bottom-feeder
fix so bad,

02:57.099 --> 02:59.399
not this gross iceberg wedge.

02:59.401 --> 03:02.168
Hey, we're all a little
cash poor sometimes.

03:02.170 --> 03:03.670
It's nothing to be upset about.

03:03.672 --> 03:05.872
I mean, I could have spotted
you for the lobster Cobb.

03:05.874 --> 03:06.882
Grammy's got a club account.

03:06.891 --> 03:08.824
Patrick, you don't understand.

03:08.826 --> 03:10.726
I'm not just cash poor.

03:10.728 --> 03:12.127
I'm everything poor.

03:12.129 --> 03:13.929
I don't come from a rich family.

03:13.931 --> 03:17.199
I'm only upper middle class.

03:18.078 --> 03:19.534
Wow.

03:20.571 --> 03:22.871
Oh, come on, who cares?

03:22.873 --> 03:24.406
I care.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.342
I've been leading you to
believe that I'm like you.

03:26.344 --> 03:29.632
Honestly, when you didn't
know where Bora Bora was...

03:29.657 --> 03:32.014
- But it's not important.
- But it is.

03:32.016 --> 03:34.183
I haven't been truthful,
and I feel guilty,

03:34.185 --> 03:36.819
like you don't even know the real me.

03:36.821 --> 03:38.687
So if you don't want to pursue this...

03:38.689 --> 03:40.623
Oh, I'm pursuing this.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.957
You're awesome.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.292
Who cares if you don't have money?

03:43.294 --> 03:46.362
What do you think credit cards are for?

03:48.833 --> 03:51.300
Lissa! Check it out.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.600
Ew, that sign-in sheet's so messy.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.592
It's 'cause there's five
times as many signatures

03:55.617 --> 03:56.438
as there should be.

03:56.463 --> 03:58.467
Lissa, this is your class.

03:58.469 --> 04:01.006
Members are pissed that they
have to be on a waiting list.

04:01.031 --> 04:03.412
- That's good, right?
- It's awesome!

04:03.414 --> 04:05.335
We should add more
classes to the schedule.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.371
PTL, that would be awesome.

04:08.396 --> 04:10.473
If I could get, like, $50 a week more,

04:10.498 --> 04:12.521
it would totally help
pay for Styrofoam crosses.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.290
- How is the video doing?
- I don't know.

04:14.292 --> 04:16.392
Every time I try to log
in, it says server busy.

04:16.394 --> 04:17.559
So annoying.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.695
Holy [bleep]!

04:19.697 --> 04:22.331
"Prayer Arms" has over 10,000 views.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.499
What?

04:23.501 --> 04:24.700
Wow.

04:24.702 --> 04:26.702
Too bad we can't charge
'em all admission.

04:27.609 --> 04:29.738
Jakey, scratch those extra classes.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.907
We have more videos to make.

04:38.373 --> 04:41.050
Hey... oh, uh, your bag.

04:43.253 --> 04:45.454
Look, I get it. You're mad.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.722
Not at all.

04:46.724 --> 04:48.157
So what if you didn't show

04:48.159 --> 04:50.092
and we failed the presentation?

04:50.094 --> 04:52.695
And what's so bad about a D average?

04:52.697 --> 04:55.331
I mean, when I decided
to take summer classes

04:55.333 --> 04:58.582
after spending the last
two semesters busting my ass

04:58.607 --> 05:01.070
while taking care of a baby full-time,

05:01.072 --> 05:02.471
I thought to myself,

05:02.473 --> 05:04.840
"Hey, Lace, don't sweat it.

05:04.842 --> 05:06.809
"Just try to at least get a D."

05:06.811 --> 05:08.287
I know. I screwed up.

05:08.498 --> 05:09.989
And for what it's worth, you were right.

05:10.014 --> 05:11.547
Sully was a bad influence,

05:11.549 --> 05:12.756
and we broke up.

05:13.185 --> 05:15.325
Oh, Matty, that's good.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.384
I really didn't see it going anywhere,

05:17.386 --> 05:19.419
and, hey, maybe when the professor

05:19.421 --> 05:22.289
is calculating my final
grade, I can go to her

05:22.291 --> 05:25.258
and just explain that my
presentation was ruined

05:25.260 --> 05:28.303
because Sully was a bad influence!

05:29.264 --> 05:30.709
All right, Jenna, I suppose we need

05:30.734 --> 05:33.210
to get down to some more serious stuff.

05:33.235 --> 05:36.636
Can you in, say, 25 words or less

05:36.638 --> 05:39.439
describe some of the
more profound neologisms

05:39.441 --> 05:42.609
utilized by James Joyce
in "Finnegans Wake"?

05:42.611 --> 05:48.148
Uh, I... I'm trying to
recall some of the most

05:48.150 --> 05:51.451
profound ones, but I can't

05:51.453 --> 05:53.053
because I'm not totally clear

05:53.055 --> 05:55.755
on what a neologism is.

05:55.757 --> 05:58.758
Uh, I couldn't get through
it without falling asleep.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.628
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.463
Are you joking?

06:05.974 --> 06:07.634
Nobody likes "Finnegans Wake."

06:07.636 --> 06:10.470
It is the most pompous,
pretentious bag of...

06:10.472 --> 06:12.239
well, let's just say I thought

06:12.241 --> 06:14.674
I'd be in preparations
for my wake

06:14.676 --> 06:16.343
by the time I got through it.

06:16.345 --> 06:19.513
No, Jenna, creative writing
is about what interests you.

06:19.515 --> 06:21.214
Your writing stands on its own.

06:21.216 --> 06:22.849
Your transcript speaks for itself.

06:22.851 --> 06:26.620
I just like to get a sense of
where my students' heads are at.

06:26.622 --> 06:28.255
Cool. Thank you.

06:28.257 --> 06:32.659
So you will need to submit
an application, of course.

06:32.661 --> 06:36.396
Do it, and I will see you in September.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.865
Wait. Are you saying...

06:38.867 --> 06:40.600
Just submit the application, Jenna,

06:40.602 --> 06:42.035
and I'll take care of the rest.

06:42.037 --> 06:43.637
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:43.639 --> 06:45.972
I've got some other
candidates to terrorize.

06:49.873 --> 06:51.674
Tell me again. How'd he say it?

06:51.676 --> 06:54.434
"Submit the application, and
I'll take care of the rest."

06:54.459 --> 06:56.092
Jenna, you killed. This is amazing.

06:56.094 --> 06:57.527
It was amazing.

06:57.529 --> 06:59.496
I'd dreamed of this
day for so long.

06:59.498 --> 07:01.865
Best library on campus, by the way.

07:01.867 --> 07:05.068
Ooh, and over here, you have
to check out this coffee place.

07:05.070 --> 07:07.837
Lattes like you've never had before.

07:07.839 --> 07:09.305
And here, Jenna Hamilton,

07:09.307 --> 07:12.275
is the home of the world's
best Thai peanut salad.

07:12.277 --> 07:14.444
Actually, Luke Mallon,

07:14.446 --> 07:16.913
the home of the world's
best Thai peanut salad

07:16.915 --> 07:19.516
is just a few miles
south of Bangor, Maine,

07:19.518 --> 07:21.885
in the basement of the student union.

07:21.887 --> 07:23.520
They have Thai food in Maine?

07:23.522 --> 07:25.822
Well, it was a lunch special one week.

07:25.824 --> 07:28.858
Oh, but they had these
incredible haddock sandwiches

07:28.860 --> 07:32.162
that I used to be so into
before I went vegetarian.

07:32.164 --> 07:33.863
I kind of want to go back not vegetarian

07:33.865 --> 07:34.974
just so I can have one.

07:34.999 --> 07:37.943
And in that moment, I had
the saddest thought ever.

07:37.968 --> 07:39.702
I might never go back there.

07:39.704 --> 07:42.305
I might not get to have
another haddock sandwich.

07:42.307 --> 07:44.307
I might not see my
tiny little dorm

07:44.309 --> 07:46.576
that I shared with
Britta, and my friends.

07:46.578 --> 07:48.244
Oh, and if you need
something scanned or copied,

07:48.246 --> 07:49.979
this place is, like, 2¢ cheaper a page.

07:49.981 --> 07:52.182
But I didn't want
anything scanned.

07:52.184 --> 07:54.117
I wanted a haddock sandwich.

07:54.119 --> 07:55.990
What was up with that?

07:57.322 --> 07:58.521
Sorry, Ally let me in,

07:58.523 --> 07:59.823
and she was gonna come tell you,

07:59.825 --> 08:01.357
but then she got distracted by QVC.

08:01.359 --> 08:03.026
It's morning; she likes to watch people

08:03.028 --> 08:05.495
order bad jewelry while she
works through the shakes.

08:05.497 --> 08:07.389
So listen. I could use a friend.

08:07.414 --> 08:09.371
Ugh, for what. So overrated.

08:09.396 --> 08:10.887
Well, not you. You're okay.

08:10.912 --> 08:12.335
But don't get me
started on everyone else.

08:12.337 --> 08:14.471
I mean, why is everyone such a pussy?

08:14.473 --> 08:17.106
Like it's my fault. Why
is everyone mad at me?

08:17.108 --> 08:18.441
A lot of that going on right now,

08:18.443 --> 08:20.343
which is why I need a favor.

08:21.858 --> 08:23.447
Okay, camera's speeding.

08:23.448 --> 08:25.048
Make sure the boom's
out of the way.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.217
Lots of energy, everybody!

08:27.219 --> 08:29.348
And... hit it!

08:29.373 --> 08:31.955
Praise and raise!

08:31.957 --> 08:34.090
Praise and praise again!

08:34.092 --> 08:36.025
Lift to the Lord!

08:36.027 --> 08:37.727
And lift again!

08:37.729 --> 08:40.630
Jake, what is this?

08:40.631 --> 08:42.999
Meet me in my office tomorrow morning,

08:43.001 --> 08:44.467
9:00 a.m. sharp.

08:44.469 --> 08:45.835
Oh...

09:00.184 --> 09:01.784
What are you doing here?

09:01.786 --> 09:05.054
Just in case the sunscreen
isn't enough for that cute face.

09:05.056 --> 09:06.422
Pack your overnight bag.

09:06.424 --> 09:08.324
I'm taking you to Catalina
for a long weekend.

09:08.326 --> 09:12.896
OMG, that sounds so
fun, but I have to work.

09:12.898 --> 09:14.097
But it's the weekend.

09:14.099 --> 09:15.048
Did you not hear the part

09:15.073 --> 09:16.603
about $12,000 in credit card debt?

09:16.628 --> 09:18.768
Oh, yeah, when you were
crying into your iceberg wedge?

09:18.770 --> 09:20.470
Definitely heard that part.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.672
- But this is my treat.
- You don't get it.

09:22.674 --> 09:24.874
If I'm gonna get myself out
of the buttload of debt I'm in,

09:24.876 --> 09:26.376
I'm gonna have to work every weekend

09:26.378 --> 09:28.378
and generate some serious ad sales.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.146
But go. Have fun.

09:32.450 --> 09:33.716
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:41.258 --> 09:42.931
Not crazy about the curry?

09:43.762 --> 09:44.961
What?

09:44.963 --> 09:46.899
No, I was just thinking
about all the stuff

09:46.924 --> 09:49.032
I'm gonna have to do
if I make this move.

09:49.034 --> 09:50.300
Wait. If you make this move?

09:50.302 --> 09:51.501
Wait. Did I say that?

09:51.503 --> 09:53.303
No, what I meant was just that

09:53.305 --> 09:55.171
everything's happening so fast.

09:55.173 --> 09:56.472
I thought you really wanted this.

09:56.474 --> 09:57.874
I did. I mean, I do.

09:57.876 --> 10:00.009
I do... definitely

10:00.011 --> 10:01.177
think this is what I want.

10:01.179 --> 10:02.267
Think?

10:02.292 --> 10:05.114
Think bordering on 100% totally know.

10:05.116 --> 10:08.284
Wow, I can't believe you'd
even be on the fence about it.

10:08.286 --> 10:09.786
I kind of went to a lot of trouble.

10:09.788 --> 10:12.088
I pushed Dean Strauss
to read your material.

10:12.090 --> 10:13.623
Jenna, am I pushing you?

10:13.625 --> 10:16.025
No, it's just, this is a
huge opportunity for me,

10:16.027 --> 10:17.694
and I want to make sure that I'm not

10:17.696 --> 10:19.862
giving up anything I'll regret.

10:19.864 --> 10:22.267
Which seems to be an
ongoing concern of yours.

10:22.968 --> 10:26.803
Wow, it was amazing how
one intuitive sentence

10:26.805 --> 10:30.204
spoken by Luke could so
easily sum up my life.

10:30.775 --> 10:34.344
Look, it's just a big
change and a big decision.

10:34.346 --> 10:36.312
Well, at the risk of pushing,

10:36.314 --> 10:37.981
I hope you make it soon,
because I would love

10:37.983 --> 10:40.216
for you to be here
to share this with me.

10:40.218 --> 10:41.735
I think it would be good for you.

10:42.354 --> 10:43.978
Think?

10:50.548 --> 10:52.783
Look, I'm sorry.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.985
I know I shouldn't have been
filming without permission,

10:54.987 --> 10:57.688
but Lissa's classes
fill up constantly, so...

10:57.690 --> 10:59.123
I've been watching you, Rosati.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.705
There have been some major hiccups.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.496
But overall, I like what I see.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.964
- Thanks.
- You follow orders.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.765
You know how to spin bull[bleep]

11:08.767 --> 11:10.062
to suck up to the important members.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.751
And I'm gonna be honest with you...

11:11.970 --> 11:13.638
I see a little of me in you.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.606
I'd like to offer you a raise.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.907
I'll take it.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.475
With an increased responsibility

11:18.477 --> 11:20.103
and a small promotion.

11:20.128 --> 11:20.790
Wow.

11:20.815 --> 11:22.853
Rosati, I assume you
have a five-year plan.

11:22.878 --> 11:27.795
Oh, yeah, I hope to
continue working here.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.954
I was just like you.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.165
I took this job right
out of high school,

11:31.190 --> 11:33.392
and I've been here 20 years.

11:38.264 --> 11:39.730
I'm so sorry, Jakey.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.198
I didn't mean to get you fired.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.599
I got promoted.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.404
This is such great
news. Congratulations!

11:47.406 --> 11:48.939
I think this is a sign.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.842
God is super happy with
my Atonercise videos!

11:51.844 --> 11:53.977
Wait. What's wrong?

11:53.979 --> 11:56.013
I thought this is what you wanted.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.718
Mrs. Parriott,

12:01.720 --> 12:03.420
I am so sorry

12:03.422 --> 12:05.889
about the hand soap in
the ladies' powder room.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.425
The vendor stopped producing
the lavender rosemary

12:08.427 --> 12:09.793
that you like so much,

12:09.795 --> 12:13.897
and as a token of our
sincerest apologies,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.899
I would like to present to you

12:15.901 --> 12:19.136
a $100 gift card which is redeemable

12:19.138 --> 12:23.307
at any of our pro shops
and spa experiences.

12:34.052 --> 12:35.552
- Hey. 
- Oh, my God, Jenna.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.774
I miss you so much.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.021
I miss you too.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.990
I just heard from housing.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.659
We got upgraded to an
off-campus apartment.

12:42.661 --> 12:43.961
Shut the [bleep] up. Really?

12:43.963 --> 12:46.163
With a dishwasher and a kitchen.

12:46.165 --> 12:49.800
And look, my mom got
us matching comforters.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.668
She had a bunch of
those 20% off coupons,

12:51.670 --> 12:53.070
and we just went crazy.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.671
You are gonna love
the stuff I got

12:54.673 --> 12:55.688
for our new place.

12:55.713 --> 12:57.207
Oh, Britta, I love them,

12:57.209 --> 12:58.742
and I can't wait to see them in person.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.777
Okay, what was I
doing? Was I lying?

13:00.779 --> 13:02.813
How could I tell my
friend that I was probably

13:02.815 --> 13:04.982
never gonna set foot
at Wyckoff again?

13:04.984 --> 13:07.806
Britta, there's actually
something I need to tell you.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.097
Anytime you're ready, Jenna.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.532
Uh, I got to go, but
I'll talk to you later.

13:12.556 --> 13:13.892
Oh, yeah, ok.

13:13.916 --> 13:14.899
Bye.

13:15.407 --> 13:17.828
And finally, as you know,

13:17.830 --> 13:20.330
I am in the process
of completing reviews

13:20.332 --> 13:22.332
for all editorial fellows.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.301
I wasn't sure if it
was my imagination

13:24.326 --> 13:25.978
or my own guilty conscience,

13:26.003 --> 13:29.304
but it felt like everything Lizzy
was saying was directed at me.

13:29.329 --> 13:31.174
These reviews are comprised of ratings

13:31.176 --> 13:34.532
on all materials submitted,
whether published or not,

13:34.557 --> 13:37.014
and will be a key factor
in determining which,

13:37.016 --> 13:39.049
if any, of you will be asked to return

13:39.051 --> 13:41.051
to Idea Bin for another summer.

13:41.961 --> 13:43.425
That's all.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.356
Oh, she's so over me
now that we're a couple.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.091
There's no way I'm getting asked back.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.294
Doesn't matter. You have SCU.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.862
Oh, my God, I'm not getting asked back?

13:51.864 --> 13:52.996
We don't know that.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.398
I'm just saying, with your talent

13:54.400 --> 13:56.199
and the contacts you're
gonna make at SCU,

13:56.201 --> 13:59.269
you'll find someplace
way better than Idea Bin.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.411
Patrick?

14:07.413 --> 14:08.745
Are you stalking me?

14:08.747 --> 14:10.650
What? No, of course not.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.949
That's... may... yeah,
a little bit. Possibly.

14:12.951 --> 14:15.085
- That is so cool.
- These are for you.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.055
You know, for working all
weekend while I go goof off.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.023
Oh, that is so sweet.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.959
So, um, listen. I've
been thinking about stuff.

14:22.961 --> 14:26.196
Oh, okay. It's okay.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.198
I get it. I totally understand.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.558
I mean, I get that you have to work.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.835
Patrick, it's really
okay. It's my fault.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.236
I should have been more honest.

14:33.238 --> 14:34.738
I just, like... I really don't want

14:34.740 --> 14:36.640
to have to keep asking
you to miss work for me.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.142
So how about winter vacation?

14:39.144 --> 14:41.044
My folks have a chalet in Gstaad.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.680
It's so crazy. Like,
Bono lives next door.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.917
It's dope snow and sweet fondue.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.902
Oh, my God, that sounds amaze,

14:50.489 --> 14:53.668
but there's a good chance I'll
have to be working then too.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.988
I don't know that you will.

14:55.013 --> 14:57.471
Do you know how long it
takes to pay off 12 grand?

14:57.496 --> 14:58.929
Yeah, about 30 seconds.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.397
Let me pay it off for you.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.067
What? No, that's... that's crazy!

15:04.069 --> 15:06.436
- Wh... you would really do that?
- Yeah, I would.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.772
Babe, 12K's nothing. It's
not worth stressing over.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.674
You can start over with a clean slate.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.245
Hey, Sadie, do you
mind grabbing the dolly?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.948
Or, yeah, I could just grab it myself.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.216
Give me a sec.

15:21.150 --> 15:23.086
"Lamest video I've ever seen.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.589
If God exists, wouldn't he
protect you from this crap?"

15:25.591 --> 15:26.671
What are you doing?

15:26.696 --> 15:29.625
Leaving feedback on Lissa's
stupid Atonercise video.

15:29.650 --> 15:30.953
What? Why would you do that?

15:30.978 --> 15:32.702
'Cause people on YouTube
need honest reviews

15:32.727 --> 15:35.142
to help them decide
what to watch... duh.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.800
Don't you think that's a little mean?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.201
What did Lissa ever do to you?

15:38.203 --> 15:40.370
Please, you think Lissa's some angel?

15:40.372 --> 15:42.172
She's a total bitch.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.242
"Bitch" is about the last word
I would use to describe Lissa.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.244
Yeah, well, that's because
you're not very astute.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.979
Oh, so now you're insulting me?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.914
What, you're gonna be all sensitive now?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.215
Lissa pissed me off,

15:52.217 --> 15:53.483
so she's getting what she deserved.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.252
And Tamara and Sergio
are also on my list.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.859
They're lucky I don't
comment on them too...

15:56.884 --> 15:58.039
Oh, my God, that's genius.

15:58.064 --> 15:59.997
I'm gonna invent Yelp
but for actual people.

16:00.022 --> 16:01.388
You're welcome.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.396
Okay, so big news.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.598
I'm pretty sure I want to go to SCU.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.414
Oh, honey, I know, but
they didn't accept you.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.350
No, I'm reapplying.

16:14.375 --> 16:15.873
I think I'm gonna get in.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.942
What? Really? Sweetie, that is amazing.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.378
I'm so proud. Wait. Why?

16:21.380 --> 16:22.390
Because it's SCU.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.847
But you love Wyckoff,

16:23.849 --> 16:25.549
and you're doing so great there...

16:25.551 --> 16:26.906
and Luke is here.

16:26.931 --> 16:28.852
And why does it take me so
long to catch on to things?

16:28.854 --> 16:30.120
I need to stop breast-feeding.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.755
My brains are being
sucked out through my...

16:31.757 --> 16:33.623
Mom! This is not about Luke.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.659
But isn't this exactly
what you told Matty

16:35.661 --> 16:37.218
not to do for you?

16:37.243 --> 16:38.242
Totally different.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.390
I've wanted to go to SCU

16:39.392 --> 16:40.849
since before I even met Luke.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.807
Luke has nothing to do with it.

16:45.007 --> 16:47.662
Honey, he does...

16:47.687 --> 16:48.700
and that's okay.

16:48.702 --> 16:50.116
I'll support you whatever you do,

16:50.141 --> 16:53.242
but know what you're doing.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.226
Call it what it is.

16:59.070 --> 16:59.859
_

17:00.272 --> 17:01.375
_

17:01.452 --> 17:02.453
_

17:02.805 --> 17:04.039
_

17:07.890 --> 17:10.709
I know we blew it
before. Totally my fault.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.498
But since our project
was going to be based

17:12.500 --> 17:15.521
on the foods of
Germany, my partner and I

17:15.546 --> 17:18.435
have prepared a surprise
for the entire class.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.328
- We have?
- Frau?

17:20.329 --> 17:21.829
Lein. Fraulein.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.865
Would you all follow
us this way, please?

17:29.672 --> 17:31.371
So what are we doing?

17:31.373 --> 17:33.373
It might have been
nice if you had given me

17:33.375 --> 17:35.909
a little bit of a heads-up
about whatever this...

17:35.911 --> 17:38.014
_

17:45.287 --> 17:46.520
This is awesome.

17:49.725 --> 17:51.325
I am very impressed.

17:51.327 --> 17:53.727
I hope you don't think for
one minute that bribing me

17:53.729 --> 17:55.514
with a food truck
will change your grade,

17:55.539 --> 17:57.831
but it will most certainly
make me reconsider

17:57.833 --> 18:00.033
rescheduling your formal presentation,

18:00.035 --> 18:01.768
one that you both will show up for

18:01.770 --> 18:03.403
and be prepared for, yes?

18:03.405 --> 18:04.771
- Yes.
- Yes!

18:04.773 --> 18:07.265
Thank you. Thank you.

18:08.257 --> 18:10.611
Matty, this is truly inspired.

18:10.613 --> 18:11.687
Thanks.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.415
So why aren't you happier?

18:15.417 --> 18:17.151
No, I'm happy.

18:17.153 --> 18:19.453
I'm just digesting the kraut.

18:19.455 --> 18:20.621
Is this about Jenna?

18:20.623 --> 18:22.835
No! It... absolutely not.

18:22.859 --> 18:24.526
My... feeling for Jenna...

18:24.527 --> 18:26.623
I knew it! Feelings for Jenna.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.828
That's not what I meant to say.

18:27.853 --> 18:30.030
It's just, you know, we
get so pissed at each other,

18:30.032 --> 18:31.532
but the feelings never seem to go away.

18:31.534 --> 18:35.976
And mine are still in
pretty high gear, I guess.

18:36.505 --> 18:38.305
What, are you gonna tell
me to back off again?

18:38.307 --> 18:39.640
Not this time.

18:39.642 --> 18:42.142
I am done interfering

18:42.144 --> 18:44.011
with all things Jenna and Matty.

18:44.013 --> 18:45.429
- Cool.
- Cool.

18:46.215 --> 18:48.148
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

18:48.150 --> 18:51.585
God, I can't stand
this. Fine. You broke me.

18:51.587 --> 18:52.920
Jenna is thinking of transferring

18:52.922 --> 18:54.087
to SCU to be with Luke,

18:54.089 --> 18:55.856
so if you really have feelings for her,

18:55.858 --> 18:58.021
you better express them
really freaking fast.

18:58.046 --> 18:58.892
What?

18:58.894 --> 19:00.594
We never had this conversation.

19:00.596 --> 19:01.703
Nein!

19:03.332 --> 19:05.465
Whoa! Hamilho's transferring.

19:05.467 --> 19:06.366
That so figures.

19:06.368 --> 19:07.768
She's probably already banged

19:07.770 --> 19:08.835
every guy at Wyckoff, so...

19:08.837 --> 19:10.671
Do you ever shut up?

19:10.673 --> 19:12.072
I'm sorry, what?

19:12.074 --> 19:13.840
Lissa's a bitch, Tamara's a jerk,

19:13.842 --> 19:15.342
Sergio's an ass[bleep], and now Jenna.

19:15.344 --> 19:17.377
Do you ever notice how
everyone else is the problem?

19:17.379 --> 19:20.080
- Constantly.
- You know what, Sadie?

19:20.082 --> 19:21.582
If you meet more than
two ass[bleep] in a day,

19:21.584 --> 19:23.350
that ass[bleep] is probably you.

19:25.687 --> 19:27.757
Go [bleep] yourself!

19:38.452 --> 19:39.566
I knew there was no way

19:39.568 --> 19:41.896
Matty would understand
my situation.

19:41.921 --> 19:44.421
And I really didn't want
to debate it with him.

19:44.423 --> 19:47.202
I could spend my whole life
second-guessing things,

19:47.218 --> 19:50.119
being afraid to take
advantage of opportunities.

19:50.121 --> 19:52.655
Or I could challenge myself.

19:52.656 --> 19:54.389
It was decision time...

19:54.391 --> 19:55.514
_

19:55.539 --> 19:56.622
_

19:56.647 --> 19:59.178
And Matty had just
helped me make mine.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.066
Send message to Matty,

20:05.068 --> 20:07.969
Lissa, Jake, and Tamara.

20:07.971 --> 20:09.671
[bleep] you all.

20:09.673 --> 20:12.240
You think I care if we're
friends, question mark.

20:12.242 --> 20:15.910
I would literally rather
die than be friends with you.

20:15.912 --> 20:17.812
Ew, no. Too pathetic.

20:18.815 --> 20:20.815
[bleep]!

20:20.817 --> 20:23.117
Is that language really
necessary, Sadie?

20:23.119 --> 20:27.055
[bleep] you, you stupid robotic bitch!
