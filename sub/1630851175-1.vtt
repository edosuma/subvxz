FREDDY:
Deep breath. Tighten. Pinch.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.370
Good. Now I move my right arm
as hard as I can

05:36.403 --> 05:38.742
toward the opposite shoulder,
like this,

05:38.775 --> 05:41.380
and then my arm goes up
and over my head.

05:41.413 --> 05:43.317
(siren wailing in distance)

05:44.921 --> 05:46.658

Up and over my head.

You're stuck, aren't you?

05:54.039 --> 05:55.742
You know what? Actually...

05:55.776 --> 05:57.947
I haven't worked
these straps before.

05:57.980 --> 06:00.251
‐Your face is really red.
‐Yeah, it's a performance.

06:14.747 --> 06:16.049
‐Fuck.
‐Are you okay?

06:16.083 --> 06:18.053
(weakly): Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good. It's a...

06:18.087 --> 06:19.991
(groans)

06:20.024 --> 06:22.061
‐It's a part of it, you know.

‐(knocking)
‐MAN: Yorick, you in there?

06:23.765 --> 06:25.301
‐Should I get that?
‐No, no, no, no, no.

‐Just shut the fuck up.
‐MAN: I have Beth's check.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.242
I need yours in an hour,

06:29.276 --> 06:31.280
(footsteps departing)

06:32.248 --> 06:33.885
Who was that?

06:33.919 --> 06:35.454

Don't worry about it.

06:35.488 --> 06:37.358

06:43.103 --> 06:46.176
Huh? See?

06:46.210 --> 06:48.782
It's okay. You can clap.
He can't hear anymore.

06:49.817 --> 06:51.253
Oh, these straps...

06:51.286 --> 06:53.725
My dad says this has
to be my last lesson.

06:53.758 --> 06:55.194
Wait. What? Why?

06:55.228 --> 06:57.198
He said we're not
getting our money's worth.

06:57.232 --> 06:59.436
I taught you how
to get out of NYPD cuffs, dude.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.240
He wanted me
to learn card tricks.

07:01.273 --> 07:03.244
I'll teach you card tricks then.
(scoffs)

07:03.277 --> 07:04.947
If you want to be like every
other asshole on the planet.

07:04.981 --> 07:06.985
‐He found a camp.
‐Dude.

07:07.018 --> 07:08.722
I'm going to it this summer.

07:08.755 --> 07:10.726
You can go to magic camp?

07:10.759 --> 07:12.161
I'm sorry, man.

07:13.197 --> 07:15.502
Oh, my God.
Your dad's a dick.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.875
Well, I am sorry, but it's true,
okay. You're old enough to...

07:20.111 --> 07:23.317
Um... all right, well,

07:23.350 --> 07:26.223
we still got 20 minutes, so...

07:26.256 --> 07:29.129
Your turn. Come on.
Let's make it count.

07:29.162 --> 07:31.099
(monkey chittering)

07:31.133 --> 07:33.037
You could have been one
of the greats, Fred.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.507
Now, we'll never know.

07:36.443 --> 07:38.447
(horns honking)

07:38.480 --> 07:40.819
Yeah, I just left him.
He was with his aide.

07:40.852 --> 07:42.823
JENNIFER:
Cut the ordinal adverbs.

07:42.856 --> 07:44.827
"Firstly, secondly."

07:44.860 --> 07:46.363
Makes me seem
like a schoolteacher.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.900
You have the committee at noon.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.503
I'll have the briefing books
in your office.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.273
"The president was asked
about Representative Brown's

07:51.306 --> 07:53.077
"legislative agenda
which links Internet hate speech

07:53.110 --> 07:54.412
to a rise
in domestic terrorism..."

07:54.446 --> 07:55.816
‐Let me guess.
‐He's whining

07:55.849 --> 07:56.985
about the First Amendment

07:57.018 --> 07:58.855
‐and calling for...
‐Unity. Yes.

07:58.888 --> 08:01.193
Let's all join hands
with the psychotics of America.

08:01.226 --> 08:02.863
He just doesn't like
that it's coming from you.

08:02.896 --> 08:04.332
BEN:
You want to add a paragraph

08:04.366 --> 08:06.571
to the end of the speech?
Hit him where it hurts?

08:06.604 --> 08:08.173
Is there press in the rotunda?

08:08.207 --> 08:10.211
Yeah, Andrew and Nick
fishing for comments.

08:10.244 --> 08:12.081
Grab them for me.
I'll give them two minutes.

08:13.818 --> 08:15.789
We're about to have a lot
of incoming calls.

08:15.822 --> 08:17.425
CHRISTINE:
I'll have the dress

08:17.458 --> 08:19.462
for the First Lady's party
waiting in your office.

08:19.497 --> 08:21.366
And Yorick's landlord called.

08:23.404 --> 08:25.408
I'm gonna kill him.

08:26.410 --> 08:29.015
There's a nail place across
the street. Ask for Ashley.

08:29.049 --> 08:31.320
Tell her you work for me.
She'll touch those up.

08:31.353 --> 08:33.858
Oh, that's okay, I'll‐I'll just
go after work. I...

08:33.892 --> 08:35.862
Give him hell.

08:35.896 --> 08:37.900
Be back in an hour.

08:40.204 --> 08:42.175
My nails are chipped.
I didn't realize she's...

08:42.208 --> 08:44.012
You represent her,

08:44.045 --> 08:46.116
and they've been picking her
apart for 20 years. Go.

08:52.896 --> 08:55.001
And thank you for having me.

08:57.606 --> 09:01.346
CHAD:
Okay, so, right there
on the subway,

09:01.380 --> 09:04.419
I whispered in his ear that I'd
suck his dick till tomorrow.

09:04.452 --> 09:06.591
He looked at me
like I was a serial killer.

09:06.624 --> 09:08.127
(phone vibrating)

09:08.160 --> 09:10.999
When does this get more fun?

09:11.033 --> 09:14.172
‐(vibrating continues)
‐Are you fucking serious?

09:14.205 --> 09:17.412
I used to have so much fun
when I was fucked‐up,

09:17.445 --> 09:19.282
you know, before it got scary.

09:19.315 --> 09:23.357
‐Who's calling you?
‐(whispers): I don't know.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.361
Do you need to get that?

09:25.394 --> 09:28.434
Sorry. Go ahead.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.173
‐Anyway, I, um...
‐HERO: It's my brother.

09:32.576 --> 09:35.014
‐(laughs softly)
‐I thought about you guys.

09:35.047 --> 09:36.517
You know, I thought
about this room.

09:36.551 --> 09:39.089
After I'd stopped
thinking about dick.

09:39.122 --> 09:40.424
‐(phone vibrating)
‐(whispers): Dude.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.128
No. I, um...

09:42.161 --> 09:43.665
Sometimes, I‐I still
want to feel like...

09:43.698 --> 09:46.236
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:46.269 --> 09:48.006
Anything is possible,

09:48.040 --> 09:49.677
‐but, uh...
‐HERO: Yeah, what do you want?

09:49.710 --> 09:52.215
‐...I think this is better.
‐HERO: Couldn't it wait?

09:52.248 --> 09:53.585
(door closes)

09:53.618 --> 09:56.022
‐What is wrong with you?
‐How's this?

09:56.056 --> 09:57.358
Fun? You making friends?

09:57.392 --> 09:59.362
Fucking sucks.

09:59.396 --> 10:01.634
Two more, and I am free.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.938
Ah, you should stop smoking.

10:03.972 --> 10:05.609
‐But why?
‐Hmm.

10:05.642 --> 10:07.145
I need some money.

10:07.178 --> 10:09.149
Get the fuck out of here.

10:09.182 --> 10:11.253
‐No, it's just‐just...
‐No. Seriously, fuck off.

10:11.286 --> 10:13.257
Just, like, a hundred bucks
or something. Can you...?

10:13.290 --> 10:15.261
‐You think I have money?
‐Just need to get

10:15.294 --> 10:17.031
some shit for tonight. Can you
please let me borrow some cash?

10:17.064 --> 10:19.035
What shit? What's tonight?

10:19.068 --> 10:23.545
Cheese and wine and crackers,
like, but nice ones. I'm, uh...

10:23.578 --> 10:26.483
I'm doing it. Tonight.

10:26.517 --> 10:28.487
‐No.
‐Yeah.

10:28.521 --> 10:30.926
I'm telling you no.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.130
‐I thought you liked Beth.
‐Well, I love Beth.

10:33.163 --> 10:34.466
‐Yeah.
‐Beth's great.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.504
Yeah, I know. I bought a ring.

10:36.537 --> 10:38.575
You're broke. You just
asked me for money.

10:38.608 --> 10:40.411
No, no, no, Joel found it
in Morocco.

10:40.444 --> 10:42.014
It's Bedouin.
It's turn of the century...

10:42.048 --> 10:44.419
Joel from the magic shop?

10:44.452 --> 10:46.256
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll show you a picture.

10:46.289 --> 10:47.526
I don't want to see it.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.429
No, no, no, it's cool.
It's... Where is it?

10:49.462 --> 10:53.203
Mom and Dad still
pay your rent, right?

10:53.237 --> 10:55.642
Uh, no.

10:55.675 --> 10:58.147
Yeah, sometimes
if I'm, like, low on cash.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.084
You don't know what you want
to do with your life.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.990
‐I'm an escape artist.
‐Jesus, Yorick.

11:03.023 --> 11:07.231
Beth loves you, for some reason,
but this ends badly,

11:07.265 --> 11:09.670
‐I promise you.
‐Oh, no, no, no, I'm not
looking for your blessing.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.143
You can't afford cheese, but you
want to marry your girlfriend.

11:13.177 --> 11:14.547
Yeah.

11:14.580 --> 11:17.285
You're keeping a monkey
prisoner in a studio.

11:17.318 --> 11:18.420
He's a service animal.

11:18.453 --> 11:20.357
You need to get
your shit together.

11:20.391 --> 11:22.729
Okay, you're gonna talk to me
about getting my shit together.

11:22.763 --> 11:25.267
‐Okay.
‐Uh‐huh. Yeah, is that what
that meeting is in there?

11:25.301 --> 11:26.737
‐Okay!
‐Oh, what, it's, the, uh,

11:26.771 --> 11:28.373
association
of responsible adults?

11:28.407 --> 11:29.710
Yup, that's what it is.

11:29.743 --> 11:31.046
Uh‐huh. Yeah, you got
a DUI in Manhattan.

11:31.079 --> 11:32.683
Do you know how hard
that is to do?

11:32.716 --> 11:34.486
Actually, you know what,
in some ways,

11:34.520 --> 11:37.091
‐that's an accomplishment, so...
‐All right. Fine.

11:37.124 --> 11:39.095
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Don't listen to me.
Embarrass yourself.

11:39.128 --> 11:40.632
Okay. Yeah, you know what,
Beth loves me

11:40.665 --> 11:42.603
and we're happy and it's
a functioning relationship.

11:42.636 --> 11:46.309
And maybe if you didn't hate
yourself so fucking much...

11:46.343 --> 11:47.445
(whispers):
Ah, whatever.

SAM:
Hey, yo.

11:51.787 --> 11:52.756
They're not gonna sign
your sheet

11:52.789 --> 11:53.558
if you miss the whole meeting,

11:53.591 --> 11:55.027
and I'm not coming
to another one

11:55.060 --> 11:56.229
of these things, so...

11:56.263 --> 11:57.799
Hey, Yorick.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.202
Sup, Sam?

12:01.741 --> 12:03.110
Don't say I didn't warn you.

12:03.143 --> 12:04.312
Thank you.

12:04.345 --> 12:07.586
Uh, sorry. I forgot the...

12:08.621 --> 12:09.723
Okay.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.471
("Company of Strangers"
by Bad Company playing)

12:22.315 --> 12:23.685
RAFE:
Don't get too attached.

12:23.718 --> 12:26.489
It's a wild animal.

12:26.524 --> 12:28.528
WOMAN:
I named him Jerry.

12:29.597 --> 12:31.834
How do you know it's a boy?

12:31.867 --> 12:34.573
Hmm. Works either way.

12:34.607 --> 12:36.844
‐You know,
they can give you leprosy.
‐Yeah, well,

12:36.877 --> 12:39.115
can't be any worse
than what you're carrying.

12:39.148 --> 12:40.619
‐Oh!
‐(chuckles)

12:40.652 --> 12:43.825
No, I can build a trap.
We can drive him out somewhere.

12:43.858 --> 12:46.129

22:49.068 --> 22:50.838
on the way back
to the Residence.

22:50.872 --> 22:52.876
Oh, and, um...

22:52.909 --> 22:55.213
stall for me with Marla
for a minute, would you?

22:55.247 --> 22:57.251
Yes, Mr. President.

23:03.062 --> 23:05.267
But you never used
to wave the lady card.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.437
‐We all respected
the hell out of you for that.
‐Hmm...

23:07.471 --> 23:09.074
"The lady card."

23:09.108 --> 23:12.214
I don't want to fight
in the press.

23:14.018 --> 23:17.057
You think you're the only one
who doesn't like Nazis?

23:17.090 --> 23:18.727
We can work together on this.

23:18.761 --> 23:20.698
You had the opportunity
to work with me, you passed.

23:20.731 --> 23:23.236
‐Oh, come on,
you would've hated that job.
‐Oh?

23:23.269 --> 23:26.075
‐Tell me more.
‐I wanted you for it,
you know that.

23:26.108 --> 23:27.912
There were a lot of voices
in the room.

23:27.946 --> 23:29.749
Don't bullshit me, Ted.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.885
You floated that idea
to the press

23:30.918 --> 23:32.221
so you could get a cookie

23:32.254 --> 23:33.489
for being such a moderate hero.

23:33.524 --> 23:35.126
You got all the political points

23:35.160 --> 23:37.097
without having to
actually do anything.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.435
‐That's how you see me.
‐You're a politician.

23:39.468 --> 23:41.172
And what are you?

23:41.205 --> 23:42.474
Believe it or not,

23:42.508 --> 23:44.311
considering a spot
in your administration

23:44.345 --> 23:46.817
didn't play as well for me
as it did for you.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.286
(laughing)

23:48.319 --> 23:49.856
I like you, Jennifer.

23:49.890 --> 23:51.760
I want us to be friends again.

23:51.793 --> 23:53.296
(chuckles)
We will be.

23:53.329 --> 23:55.735
In about two and a half years.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.770
(car horn honks)

23:59.809 --> 24:01.178
(indistinct chatter over radio)

24:01.212 --> 24:02.749
I'm gonna need you to work
on Saturday.

24:02.782 --> 24:04.819
Joey's got his daughter's
first communion.

24:04.853 --> 24:06.957
I can't. Sorry.

24:06.990 --> 24:10.196
‐Why not?
‐I don't want to.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.200
(chatter over radio)

24:12.234 --> 24:14.004
(Mike sighs)

24:16.008 --> 24:17.845
I told her about us.

24:19.816 --> 24:22.321
Shut up. You did not.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.476
What did she say?

24:35.246 --> 24:36.950
(chuckles)

24:44.398 --> 24:46.168
BETH:
Entitled little shits.

24:46.202 --> 24:48.106
Ryan‐‐ the kid
I was telling you about‐‐

24:48.139 --> 24:49.576
I gave Ryan a "C"
on his term paper,

24:49.609 --> 24:51.947
because it was
objectively terrible.

24:51.980 --> 24:54.485
I mean, he uses semicolons
all the time.

24:54.519 --> 24:57.357
Literally no discernible reason
to use a semicolon.

24:57.391 --> 24:59.094
It's like he's decorating
the page.

24:59.128 --> 25:00.463
‐Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.
‐Thanks.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.369
And this motherfucker asks
to talk to me after class.

25:03.403 --> 25:05.373
Well, semicolons are tricky.

25:05.407 --> 25:07.912
Whoa. What is this?

25:07.945 --> 25:10.483
‐Grilled cheese.
‐I can see that.

25:10.518 --> 25:13.524
Three different cheeses‐‐
cheddar, jack, and goat‐‐

25:13.557 --> 25:15.494
and there's, uh,
tomato in there, too.

25:15.528 --> 25:16.797
Mmm.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.439
Um, so, Ryan...

25:21.472 --> 25:23.009
(groans)

25:23.042 --> 25:24.612
Ryan tells me he's gonna get
the professor involved,

25:24.646 --> 25:27.417
because he claims
that I'm biased against him.

25:28.453 --> 25:30.357
Holy shit. This is amazing.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.461
Yeah, you are biased.
You told me you hate his face.

25:32.495 --> 25:34.365
Yeah, well,
he told the professor

25:34.398 --> 25:36.837
that he thinks
I'm "out to get him"

25:36.870 --> 25:38.874
because I, apparently,

25:38.907 --> 25:41.546
used the phrase "white
privilege" the other week,

25:41.580 --> 25:43.483
and he claims that I was looking
right at him when I said it.

25:43.517 --> 25:45.120
Man, what a dick.

25:45.153 --> 25:47.324
What about you?
How was Freddy?

25:47.357 --> 25:49.294
‐You get him in the jacket?
‐Uh, yeah.

25:49.328 --> 25:50.463
Sort of.

25:52.502 --> 25:54.506
Whoa. (chuckles)

25:54.539 --> 25:56.275
Ten‐year‐olds shouldn't be
claustrophobic, right?

25:56.308 --> 25:57.912
Like, what happened to you,
Freddy?

25:57.945 --> 25:59.448
(both chuckle)

26:00.918 --> 26:04.191
I think I should come with you
to Australia.

26:04.224 --> 26:05.628
I think I should come.

26:05.661 --> 26:07.532
What? What about your show?

26:07.565 --> 26:09.301
‐I thought Joel said yes.
‐Yeah, I know.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.138
Only if I can get it down
to 45 minutes.

26:11.172 --> 26:12.508
So get it down to 45 minutes.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.044
No, there's no way.
That's like...

26:14.078 --> 26:16.048
That's like "burning chair,"
"straitjacket tank,"

26:16.082 --> 26:17.952
‐and, like, one other thing
and that's it.
‐So cut "straitjacket tank."

26:17.985 --> 26:19.923
I'm not‐‐ What?

26:19.956 --> 26:21.425
Hey, that's the whole thing.

26:21.459 --> 26:22.995
That's‐that's the history
of magic.

26:23.029 --> 26:25.133
It's the point of the‐‐
I'm not gonna...

26:25.166 --> 26:26.970
Uh...

26:27.003 --> 26:30.009
Look, I can work on this
from anywhere.

26:33.149 --> 26:35.186
Sorry,
you don't want me to come?

26:35.220 --> 26:37.157
Babe, of course
I want you to come.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.494
Yeah, visit, but...

26:38.527 --> 26:39.929
Yeah, but an hour
on a shitty stage

26:39.963 --> 26:40.931
in the back of a magic shop...

26:40.965 --> 26:43.604
This is the biggest opportunity
you've had.

26:55.995 --> 26:57.464
(sighs)

26:58.466 --> 27:00.538
Open it.

27:05.614 --> 27:08.119
It's, um, it's bedouin.

27:08.152 --> 27:09.421
It's turn of the century.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.459
What are you...

27:11.493 --> 27:13.931
Yeah. This makes sense.

27:13.964 --> 27:15.400
‐Us. You and me.
‐Yorick.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.237
Look, I know,
I know I'm a bit of a mess.

27:17.270 --> 27:19.074
‐Babe...
‐And I know you think
I don't know what I want,

27:19.108 --> 27:20.276
but I do.

27:21.713 --> 27:23.349
I want you.

27:23.382 --> 27:25.453
It's all I've ever wanted.

27:27.992 --> 27:29.361
We can go to the courthouse,

27:29.394 --> 27:31.465
or we can have 600 people
at the MoMA.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.436
I'll friggin' do it tonight.
I don't...

27:33.469 --> 27:35.541
Whatever you want, okay?
But, just, Beth,

27:35.574 --> 27:38.981
let's be us forever, okay?

27:40.250 --> 27:42.522
Fucking marry me.

27:45.594 --> 27:49.067
I can't just ask you to drop
your life and move to Australia.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.105
Yes, you can.
Please ask me.

27:51.138 --> 27:53.309
You can't just give me
a ring and...

27:53.342 --> 27:56.115
‐Yeah, it's not just a ring.
‐No, it's bedouin.

27:56.148 --> 27:57.518
Yeah, you said you didn't want
a diamond.

27:57.552 --> 28:00.390
‐You said diamonds are...
‐You can't come to Australia

28:00.423 --> 28:03.396
and be, what,
my professional fiancé?

28:03.429 --> 28:05.701
We are 27.

28:05.734 --> 28:07.638
Oh, come on. My parents were
young when they got married.

28:07.672 --> 28:09.274
So, what, are you gonna just sit
in the apartment

28:09.308 --> 28:10.711
while I go to school?

28:10.744 --> 28:12.380
And stall for another year
on your show?

28:12.414 --> 28:14.652
No, I'll help you.
And, yeah, I'll work on my show.

28:14.686 --> 28:16.422
I'm pretty sure
Australians like magic.

28:16.455 --> 28:18.292
‐You'll be bored,
and you'll blame me.
‐Bored?

28:18.326 --> 28:19.662
‐What are you talking about?
‐You think you won't,
but you will,

28:19.696 --> 28:21.365
‐and you'll hold me back.
‐Hold you ba...

28:21.398 --> 28:23.670
Hold you back from what?

28:23.704 --> 28:26.242
From meeting people,
from diving in.

28:28.780 --> 28:31.485
Sorry,
from meeting‐meeting people?

28:32.522 --> 28:34.157

28:35.193 --> 28:38.534
Oh, my God. Yeah.

28:39.802 --> 28:43.476
Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, go.

28:43.510 --> 28:46.382
‐Meet people.
Fucking Hemsworths and shit.
‐Oh, you're being an asshole.

28:46.415 --> 28:48.452

28:48.486 --> 28:50.023

Oh, my God. You're giving me
shit about my show?

28:54.331 --> 28:55.300
I didn't have time to work today

28:55.333 --> 28:57.237
because you want to know
what I was doing, Beth?

28:57.270 --> 29:00.376
I was packing your shit, uh‐huh,
and then, yeah,

29:00.410 --> 29:02.414
‐I was getting
your dry cleaning.
‐(screeching)

29:02.447 --> 29:04.351

to make your dinner.

29:04.384 --> 29:06.488
And then I just
fucking proposed to you,

29:06.523 --> 29:09.127
and you tell me you want to go
to Australia to meet people!

29:09.161 --> 29:11.332

29:12.434 --> 29:13.604

29:13.637 --> 29:15.473
I didn't ask you to get
my dry cleaning,

29:15.507 --> 29:18.279
‐and I didn't ask you to pack
for me.
‐I know. I know, I know.

29:18.312 --> 29:19.616
I did it 'cause I'm a nice guy
and I love you,

29:19.649 --> 29:21.620
even though you make me
very fucking angry. Can we‐‐ no,

for the den.
Laurie knows a guy on the Cape

33:45.814 --> 33:48.018
that makes them
out of old World War II vessels.

33:48.052 --> 33:51.493
Well, the house
is beautiful, Ken.

33:51.526 --> 33:54.064
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

33:54.097 --> 33:55.801
‐(giggling)
‐Oh!

33:55.834 --> 33:58.372
‐Hey, wait, wait.
No running, please. Sorry.
‐(laughs)

33:58.405 --> 34:00.076
Only kids at the party.

34:00.109 --> 34:01.846
Kim. Nice to see you.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.683
‐Where's your mom?
‐Oh, she's hiding.

34:03.717 --> 34:06.054
Dad wanted to put a tent
in the Rose Garden

34:06.088 --> 34:08.459
‐and a 20‐piece orchestra.
She's...
‐(chuckles): Oh.

34:08.493 --> 34:10.396
She's more understated.

34:10.429 --> 34:13.670
‐Well, I'm very glad to be here.
‐Are you?

34:13.703 --> 34:15.541
I thought
you would have wanted to avoid

34:15.574 --> 34:17.945
associating with women haters.

34:17.978 --> 34:19.715
‐I...
‐I'm kidding.

34:19.749 --> 34:21.084
(both chuckling)

34:22.555 --> 34:25.527
‐How's Hero?
‐Fine. Good.

34:25.561 --> 34:27.731
‐An EMT in New York.
‐Oh.

34:27.765 --> 34:30.737
The last time I saw her
was at the inauguration.

34:30.771 --> 34:33.677
That was a fun night. Memorable.

34:33.710 --> 34:35.681
She certainly enjoyed herself.

34:35.714 --> 34:38.553
Oh, excuse me. Nicholas
is double‐fisting desserts.

34:38.587 --> 34:39.522
It's good to see you.

34:42.761 --> 34:44.565
Ah‐ah‐ah, uh‐uh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:44.599 --> 34:46.769
No‐‐ okay, let's just do
a few, okay?

34:46.803 --> 34:48.607
Can you pick one?
Okay, that's not one.

34:48.640 --> 34:50.611
So sorry to interrupt,

34:50.644 --> 34:53.683
but I need to borrow my husband.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.687
Nice talking to you.

34:55.721 --> 34:59.094
A solid 15 minutes
on oil futures.

34:59.127 --> 35:00.697
I can't do it, Jen.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.668
‐I don't know how you can.
‐(chuckles)

35:03.737 --> 35:06.174
Yorick's landlord
called this morning.

35:06.208 --> 35:08.178
He didn't pay the rent.

35:08.212 --> 35:10.751
I wired him some money.

35:11.753 --> 35:13.924
We got to stop bailing him out.

35:13.957 --> 35:15.459
What, you want him
living with you?

35:15.494 --> 35:17.631
Doing magic in the basement?

35:17.665 --> 35:20.704
‐(chuckling): No.
‐No?

35:23.910 --> 35:26.014
I set up the guest bedroom.

35:26.048 --> 35:27.618
Oh, I have a room
at the Jefferson.

35:27.651 --> 35:29.154
‐Well, you didn't have to.
‐I wasn't sure.

35:29.187 --> 35:31.893
‐I have to leave early anyway.
‐Okay, okay.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.211
I miss you.

35:41.244 --> 35:43.048
But I'm an asshole.

35:43.082 --> 35:46.756
You are, but...

35:46.789 --> 35:49.762
This is stupid. This isn't us.

35:52.100 --> 35:55.540
I forgive you. Or I can.

35:55.574 --> 35:57.043
I was working all the time.

35:57.076 --> 35:59.949
‐None of this is your fault.
‐Well,

35:59.982 --> 36:02.153
I'm not saying that. I‐I...
(chuckles softly)

36:02.186 --> 36:04.659
It's just maybe...

36:04.692 --> 36:06.963
you've punished yourself enough?

36:06.996 --> 36:11.004
Maybe I've punished you enough.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.649
This time apart...

36:16.683 --> 36:18.018
Jen.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.254
We can keep it
as quiet as you want.

36:36.288 --> 36:39.662
Wait till after the midterms.

36:39.695 --> 36:41.532
But I spoke to Martin.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.536
They're starting the toasts.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.574
JENNIFER:
We'll be right in.

36:49.915 --> 36:51.919
You talked to a lawyer.

36:56.261 --> 36:58.867
Ask me for a divorce.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.570
I'd like to hear you say it.

37:00.604 --> 37:03.543
There's a good way to do this.

37:04.310 --> 37:07.951
I love you. I always will.

37:07.985 --> 37:10.724
But it is time.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.236
When the kids were little,
Marla used to write

37:17.270 --> 37:19.274
these little notes,
and she put them

37:19.307 --> 37:21.244
in their shoes.

37:21.278 --> 37:24.117
Sometimes there was
glitter involved, right?

37:24.150 --> 37:26.923
The whole house
was glitter back then.

37:26.956 --> 37:29.027
I think just about every dress
Kimber wore

37:29.060 --> 37:31.131
until she was 15
was covered in it.

37:31.164 --> 37:33.770
15? Try 25.

37:33.803 --> 37:35.774
(laughter)

37:35.807 --> 37:38.880
CAMPBELL:
Marla, you made
our children's lives magical.

37:38.913 --> 37:41.284
Always.
And it's been a great pleasure

37:41.318 --> 37:42.988
to watch you
these past few years

37:43.021 --> 37:45.259
as you've become a mother
to this country.

37:45.292 --> 37:47.998
America's lucky to have you.

37:48.031 --> 37:50.637
I'm lucky to have you.

37:50.670 --> 37:52.608
Happy birthday, darling.

37:52.641 --> 37:54.645
‐(chatter and laughter)
‐(applause)

38:09.842 --> 38:11.879
(exhales)

38:34.825 --> 38:36.796
ROBBIE:
Oh, you're still working.

38:38.165 --> 38:40.336
The party place
rented our bounce house

38:40.369 --> 38:41.873
to some other family.

38:41.906 --> 38:44.812
‐They're offering me Paw Patrol.
‐(chuckles)

38:44.845 --> 38:46.916
Conner's gonna freak.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.318
I'll have Maggie call
in the morning.

38:48.352 --> 38:50.322
Don't make your assistant call.

38:50.356 --> 38:51.959
What else she gonna do?

38:51.993 --> 38:53.930
If Maggie tweets
that she spent the day

38:53.963 --> 38:55.700
‐calling party suppliers...
‐I'll do it.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.071
‐Come here. Come here,
come here, come here, come here.
‐I...

38:58.105 --> 38:59.942
(Nora sighs)

38:59.975 --> 39:01.679
Long day?

39:01.712 --> 39:03.683
The longest.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.085
Tomorrow will be longer.

39:05.119 --> 39:07.791
(both chuckle)

39:15.072 --> 39:16.776
(Mack screams)

39:16.809 --> 39:18.880
MACK:
Daddy!

39:18.913 --> 39:20.817
You want to take this one?

39:20.851 --> 39:23.723
She wants you.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.402
MACK:
Daddy!

39:30.436 --> 39:32.139
ROBBIE:
You're okay, sweetie.

39:32.173 --> 39:33.141
I'm coming.

39:33.175 --> 39:34.845
MACK:
I‐I had a bad dream, I...

39:34.879 --> 39:36.716
ROBBIE:
Put your blanket back, come on.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.718
You're okay, it's just a dream.

39:37.751 --> 39:38.887
MACK:
No, it‐it was real.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.857
ROBBIE:
Shh... come on.

39:45.901 --> 39:48.005
HERO:
How did she take it?

39:48.038 --> 39:50.209
(Mike sighs)

39:50.242 --> 39:53.148
MIKE:
She was upset.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.352
Hurt.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.730
But she gets it, I think.
Or she will.

40:00.764 --> 40:03.903
It hasn't been working
for a while.

40:06.909 --> 40:08.378
HERO:
When'd you do it?

40:09.447 --> 40:12.153
Before work.

40:12.186 --> 40:14.157
HERO:
How?

40:14.190 --> 40:16.929
I don't want to talk
about her, okay?

40:16.963 --> 40:21.037
I mean, can't we be happy
for a solid minute? Huh?

40:21.071 --> 40:23.408
I did the thing.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.020
Hey.

40:29.053 --> 40:32.026
I did the thing.

40:32.059 --> 40:34.063
(both chuckle)

40:40.109 --> 40:42.146
(chuckles)

40:43.950 --> 40:46.923
I will be back in a second.

40:46.956 --> 40:48.927
(siren wailing in distance)

41:06.094 --> 41:08.065
(phone vibrating)

41:18.185 --> 41:19.855
‐(urinating)
‐(dog whining)

41:19.888 --> 41:22.226
‐Hey, buddy.
‐(zips up)

41:22.259 --> 41:24.565
What you doing out here?

41:24.598 --> 41:26.468
Huh?

41:28.472 --> 41:30.810
You got a person?

41:32.146 --> 41:34.417
Hey.
(whistles)

41:34.450 --> 41:36.454
(whining)

41:42.433 --> 41:44.872
Okay.

41:44.905 --> 41:48.245
‐(sneezes, barks)
‐You... stay.

41:48.278 --> 41:50.249
(dog whining)

41:58.165 --> 42:01.004
There's a dog out here.

42:01.037 --> 42:02.406
(door closes)

42:02.440 --> 42:05.412
Oh, your wife is texting you.
She, uh,

42:05.446 --> 42:07.450
wants to know
when you're gonna be home.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.555
And can you please get diapers
on the way?

42:09.588 --> 42:12.360
‐Fairway's open 24 hours.
‐(clatters)

42:14.898 --> 42:16.869
I am gonna tell her.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.273
‐I don't give a shit
what you do.
‐Don't say that.

42:19.307 --> 42:21.411
Don't. It's not that simple.
We have a kid.

42:21.444 --> 42:23.482
I want to tell her.

42:23.516 --> 42:26.187
‐You know,
I'm not trying to hurt you.
‐Well, you can't hurt me.

42:26.221 --> 42:28.893
You're a 40‐year‐old paramedic

42:28.926 --> 42:30.497
with a wife
who doesn't want to fuck him

42:30.530 --> 42:32.901
and a baby that you never wanted
in the first place.

42:32.934 --> 42:36.174
Well, if I'm such a piece
of shit, why are you so angry?

42:36.207 --> 42:38.211
Hmm?

42:40.182 --> 42:42.486
You know what? Get out.

42:42.521 --> 42:45.325
‐What? Okay, stop.
‐Get out. Walk home, okay?

42:45.359 --> 42:47.096
Get out. Get‐get out.

42:47.129 --> 42:49.167
‐Are you serious?
‐Yes. Get out!

42:49.200 --> 42:51.037
Stop!

42:51.071 --> 42:52.306
Get out.

42:52.339 --> 42:53.643
‐Jesus Christ!
‐Get out!

42:53.676 --> 42:56.114
I'm sorry I'm not rushing
to blow up a marriage

42:56.147 --> 42:57.918
‐to run off
with some traumatized...
‐Get out!

42:57.951 --> 42:58.953
Ow!

43:00.289 --> 43:02.326
‐Fuck!
‐Get out.

43:02.359 --> 43:04.531
‐Do not!
‐Get out!

43:04.565 --> 43:07.203
Oh, there you are,
you fucking coward.

43:07.236 --> 43:09.508
Coward? Huh? Coward?

43:09.541 --> 43:11.645
‐Coward?
‐Get off me! Get out! Get out!

43:11.679 --> 43:13.348
(grunts)

43:13.382 --> 43:15.386
Get... out!

43:15.419 --> 43:18.058
(groans)

43:18.091 --> 43:19.060
Oh, no.

43:19.093 --> 43:21.064
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43:21.097 --> 43:22.466
No, no, no, no.

43:22.501 --> 43:23.468
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:23.503 --> 43:25.974
Oh, my God. Uh... uh...

43:26.007 --> 43:29.213
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

43:29.247 --> 43:31.084
‐(soft wheezing)
‐You're okay. You're okay.

43:31.117 --> 43:33.556
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

43:33.589 --> 43:35.259
Stay with me.
Hey, stay with me.

43:35.292 --> 43:38.031
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

43:38.064 --> 43:40.135
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

43:40.169 --> 43:42.674
Oh, my God.

43:43.676 --> 43:46.080
(panting)

43:52.393 --> 43:53.930
(computer beeps)

43:56.301 --> 43:58.338
(computer chimes)

44:02.046 --> 44:04.083
(indistinct chatter)

44:27.196 --> 44:28.666
They're gonna try
to strong‐arm you.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.269
A billion dollars for satellites

44:30.302 --> 44:31.639
and establishing
supremacy in space.

44:31.672 --> 44:33.141
Ronald Reagan
Star Wars bullshit.

44:33.175 --> 44:35.379
It's absurd,
and you should fight them.

44:37.349 --> 44:39.320
Can someone grab me
a cup of coffee?

44:39.353 --> 44:41.257
‐Yes, ma'am.
‐(quietly): Thank you.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.561
Of course.

44:42.594 --> 44:44.430
Oh, not on the floor, please.

44:48.171 --> 44:50.142
(quiet chatter)

45:05.305 --> 45:07.476
Yeah.

45:07.511 --> 45:09.480
I'll have a draft
on your desk by 9:00.

45:09.515 --> 45:11.685
He'll want to make his changes,
but I think we're almost there.

45:11.719 --> 45:15.092
Mackenzie! Conner!
Let's go! You're late!

45:15.125 --> 45:18.465
Sorry. My son crawled in bed
with us at 4:00 in the morning.

45:18.499 --> 45:20.302
Nobody slept very well.

45:34.498 --> 45:37.737
I'll see you at the office.

45:37.771 --> 45:39.708
Ah, fuck!

45:40.810 --> 45:42.614
(exhales)

45:42.647 --> 45:45.052
We're late for school!

45:45.085 --> 45:46.487
(drawer opens)

45:50.630 --> 45:52.634
(officer speaking indistinctly)

45:52.667 --> 45:54.638
There's a dead dog out here.

45:54.671 --> 45:56.642
When was the vehicle
reported missing?

45:56.675 --> 45:59.480
(dispatcher speaking
indistinctly)

45:59.514 --> 46:01.217
OFFICER:
Roger that.

46:01.251 --> 46:03.154
Moving in.

46:10.670 --> 46:12.641
Is anybody in there?

46:16.715 --> 46:19.521
(quiet chatter)

46:28.271 --> 46:30.409
(knocking)

46:30.442 --> 46:31.779
MAN:
Hello?

46:31.812 --> 46:33.248
(handle rattling)

46:33.281 --> 46:35.720
(clattering)

46:46.174 --> 46:47.644
Hey, can you get your brother?

46:47.677 --> 46:49.146
He's in my room with Daddy.

46:49.180 --> 46:50.550
They're still asleep.

46:50.583 --> 46:52.386
(Nora scoffs)

46:52.419 --> 46:54.390
MAN (on TV):
Israeli jet fighters...

46:54.423 --> 46:56.294
(drawer slams)

47:11.558 --> 47:13.629
(door creaking)

47:34.337 --> 47:36.307
(quiet chatter)

47:44.357 --> 47:45.760
‐Sir?
‐Hmm?

47:45.793 --> 47:47.764
There's been a mass casualty
event in Israel.

47:47.797 --> 47:50.168
‐We need to move you right away.
‐Are we in any danger?
