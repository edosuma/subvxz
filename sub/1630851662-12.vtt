00:23.189 --> 00:25.483
<i>I was young,
just 28, on the road
with my act.</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:29.195
<i>For the past few years,
I'd been entertaining
audiences</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:33.366
<i>with my astonishing illusions
and wondrous wizardry.</i>

00:33.450 --> 00:36.202
<i>But now,
I had a wife, Sindella,</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:40.623
<i>and our 2-year-old daughter,
Zatanna, waiting for me
back home.</i>

00:43.668 --> 00:45.628
<i>My act was a success.</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:48.006
<i>My stage illusions
were renowned,</i>

00:48.089 --> 00:50.633
<i>thanks to a touch
of real magic.</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:53.052
<i>My audiences
were always dazzled.</i>

00:54.512 --> 00:57.098
<i>But one night,
something went wrong.</i>

00:57.182 --> 01:00.185
<i>A curtain caught fire.
The fire spread quickly.</i>

01:00.268 --> 01:02.187
<i>The audience was in danger.</i>

01:02.270 --> 01:03.980
<i>Without a second thought...</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:10.487
<i>...I used my magic
to put out the flames.</i>

01:10.570 --> 01:13.323
<i>Uh... Presto!</i>

01:13.406 --> 01:16.993
<i>-The audience thought
it was all part of the act.</i>

01:17.076 --> 01:18.828
<i>My grand finale.</i>

01:19.704 --> 01:21.456
<i>But for me,</i>

01:21.539 --> 01:23.333
<i>it was a new beginning.</i>

02:02.747 --> 02:03.790
Teekl!

02:20.807 --> 02:24.644
Mother of Goat!
Diamond-guy killed Teekl.

02:24.727 --> 02:29.440
Causing Klarion
to return to his true form
as a Chaos Lord.

02:29.524 --> 02:33.695
A form he could not maintain
on the Earthly plane.

02:33.778 --> 02:37.866
Now, with that lovely bit
of nastiness out of the way,

02:37.949 --> 02:40.827
it's time to have some fun.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.830
Let's start
with this eyesore.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.267
Whee!

03:20.909 --> 03:22.785
That was entertaining.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.204
Lord of Chaos,

03:26.539 --> 03:29.459
you dare meddle
with the balance of...

03:35.048 --> 03:37.550
Oh, well done, Flaw.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.136
I do believe
you spared us a lecture.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.318
Damn it. Local Ley lines
have been disrupted.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.745
Power of Zeus!

04:08.581 --> 04:11.709
I simply cannot understand
how Klarion allowed

04:11.793 --> 04:14.921
such pathetic creatures
to thwart Chaos' will.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.967
Hmm. Time to unleash
the chaos.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.392
I got them.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.686
Ah! I'm okay.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.687
Dad.

Action!

04:45.702 --> 04:47.954
Captain, we're surrounded.
Shields are failing.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.789
There's only one way

04:49.872 --> 04:51.082
Cut!

04:51.165 --> 04:53.084
Okay. Great stuff, people.
Really great.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.586
We're just gonna
run it one more time.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.754
For coverage.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.590
Gar, buddy,

04:59.674 --> 05:03.219
this is supposed to be
life or death for Tork.

05:03.302 --> 05:04.637
And at nearly 3:00
in the morning,

05:04.721 --> 05:06.055
with everyone on overtime,

05:06.139 --> 05:07.932
it's almost
life and death
for me.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.936
So can you please
just give it more...

05:12.854 --> 05:14.480
More.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.399
Sure. J.A. Sure.

Now I'm just a flaming diamond
careening through
time and space.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.975
I hate to admit it,
but I need a hero.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.441
Good morning, Charlie.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.776
Morning, Penny.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.945
Okay, kids. Next stop, school.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.947
- Uh-uh-uh!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.992
No fussing
and frowning allowed
on old Charlie's bus.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.328
Only nice big smiles.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.571
I had that.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.490
I didn't want to
take the chance.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.159
As it is, your landing
could have destabilized
the entire bridge.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.286
- It didn't.
But it could have.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.205
- We don't yet know
the limits of your powers.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.250
Huh! Since when does
Superman have a sidekick?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.419
- Sorry, Super... boy.
Duty calls.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.347
Dang it, too late.
Gotta find another hero.

07:11.430 --> 07:15.726
But first,
I need an anchor
to this mortal plane.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.271
This motorcycle will do.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.030
I'm taking over
your dumb skateboard, mortal.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.158
Uh, it's a bus.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.535
Bus. Bus.
You knew I meant...

07:32.618 --> 07:35.788
Hey, you remind me of somebody.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.295
<i>After saving
the audience from the fire,</i>

07:42.378 --> 07:47.717
<i>I was moved to do more
with my abilities
than simply entertain.</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:52.388
<i>Lacking a clear
direction forward
drove me to distraction.</i>

07:52.471 --> 07:53.639
<i>And then...</i>

07:55.099 --> 07:58.436
<i>...there he was,
the Superman.</i>

07:58.519 --> 08:01.772
<i>I had, of course,
heard of the Man of Steel,</i>

08:01.856 --> 08:05.735
<i>but I had not yet seen him
through my daughter's eyes.</i>

08:08.779 --> 08:10.740
<i>Superman astonished the world</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:15.620
<i>with wondrous feats of flight
and strength and courage.</i>

08:15.703 --> 08:18.080
<i>But behind his heroic acts,</i>

08:18.164 --> 08:21.250
<i>I saw an alien
from another world,</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:23.252
<i>an immigrant like me,</i>

08:23.336 --> 08:26.631
<i>fighting to keep
his adopted planet safe.</i>

08:26.714 --> 08:29.926
<i>Could I not do as much
for my adopted country?</i>

08:31.052 --> 08:33.221
<i>I pondered this question.</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:37.892
<i>I prayed for guidance
until I knew
what I needed to do.</i>

08:37.975 --> 08:42.230
<i>Sindella was nervous for me,
but understood.</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:44.607
<i>-And so, inspired by...</i>

08:44.690 --> 08:46.525
<i>-...Superman and my daughter...</i>

08:48.444 --> 08:49.737
<i>...it began.</i>

08:49.820 --> 08:51.864
<i>Between performances
and family time,</i>

08:51.948 --> 08:55.910
<i>I used my gifts
to protect and serve society.</i>

08:55.993 --> 08:59.664
<i>Still, I wished to do more.</i>

09:00.706 --> 09:03.042
<i>And just like magic...</i>

09:06.128 --> 09:08.923
Dad? Nabu? Anybody?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.133
<i>Oui.</i>

09:11.217 --> 09:14.887
Your father is well enough.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.144
Now do you believe
that Child is a threat?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.396
We do.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.897
And that you need
our help to fight her?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.608
Possibly.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.859
What the hell was that?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.861
Stealing our power
without asking.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.321
There wasn't time to ask.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.699
The kid had just demolished
the Tower of Fate.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.661
I was the only one conscious
to even try to stop her
from doing it again in...

09:38.744 --> 09:41.956
I don't know,
New York or El Paso.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.208
Look, I'm sorry.
I am.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.127
But I had to
give it a shot.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.797
- All right.
- Yeah, I guess.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.509
But please
do not do that again
without asking first.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.188
Hmm.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.317
The hunt for Child
will now commence.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.695
Can you call on
the Lords of Order,
ask for a power boost?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.905
That is not their way.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.283
Nor will it be necessary.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.804
Listen, <i>bubala,</i>
you're giving me fits, here.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.891
Last season, it was
all that prima donna crap,

10:41.974 --> 10:43.893
feuding with
the not-to-be-missed Granny,

10:43.976 --> 10:47.063
outsiders missions
making you late,
et cetera, et cetera.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.192
But at least you were sharp,
in the moment.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.736
This year, I can't even
get you to focus.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.405
You're, like,
a million miles away.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.784
More like 140 million.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.869
Uh, okay.

11:01.952 --> 11:07.208
Look, I know your buddy
Superboy passed.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.752
Do you need some help dealing?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.420
The studio has resources.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.880
No, man, I'm fine.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.092
Just...
I'm tired.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.595
So maybe you need a rest,
you know, some downtime, huh?

11:19.678 --> 11:23.265
Yeah, right.
I thought everyone's jobs
depended on me.

11:25.142 --> 11:28.104
We've been building up
Harvey's Lieutenant Der'Chow
character.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.940
He's become
a real fan favorite, see?

11:31.023 --> 11:34.276
The suits think
he can carry the load...

11:34.360 --> 11:38.114
You know, until you're rested
and ready to return.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.533
Just think about it.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.827
We love you, kid.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.038
I just want
what's best for the show.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.873
And you, of course.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.880
<i>Kent Nelson
gave me direction, focus.</i>

11:54.964 --> 11:59.927
<i>Over the next few years,
the work dedicated
to my secret calling</i>

12:00.010 --> 12:02.012
<i>increased exponentially.</i>

12:02.096 --> 12:06.642
<i>But between
my public stage career
and my secret life as a hero,</i>

12:06.725 --> 12:09.728
<i>I spent less and less time
at home.</i>

12:09.812 --> 12:14.233
<i>Kent helped out,
practically becoming
a member of the family,</i>

12:14.316 --> 12:16.777
<i>watching over them
when I could not.</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:20.990
<i>Still, I hated being away
from Sindella and Zatanna.</i>

12:21.949 --> 12:24.493
<i>Once again, I prayed on it</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:27.997
<i>and came to believe
my absence from my family</i>

12:28.080 --> 12:32.209
<i>was a necessary sacrifice
for the greater good.</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:39.508
<i>But God, the universe
or fate had other ideas.</i>

12:39.592 --> 12:42.219
<i>It was not an enemy
that undid me.</i>

12:44.305 --> 12:46.682
<i>It was cancer.</i>

12:46.765 --> 12:51.395
<i>I tried to be there
for Sindella, for Zatanna,</i>

12:51.479 --> 12:54.523
<i>but still I had to perform
to pay medical bills,</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:57.693
<i>had to fight
to protect the world.</i>

12:57.776 --> 13:00.738
<i>Then, in some damned hotel</i>

13:00.821 --> 13:03.032
<i>-in some damned city...</i>

13:04.575 --> 13:07.536
<i>...there came another
knock on the door.</i>

13:16.378 --> 13:18.297
Holy moly!

13:23.969 --> 13:27.223
Didn't know
they had active volcanoes
in Sydney.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.974
They do not.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.976
Anyone tell the volcano?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.186
We are too late.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.981
Child has come and gone,

13:36.065 --> 13:40.653
and this land
is forever scarred
by her mark of Chaos.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.696
The Pillar of Fire.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.573
We must go.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.908
But we have to help
the people here.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.744
We have to save
the world.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.788
Fate is correct.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.456
I have summoned the League,

13:52.540 --> 13:56.001
the outsiders,
and every mystic champion
I could recruit.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.087
<i>Sending heroes
to each new crisis</i>

13:58.170 --> 14:01.173
<i>as quickly as Madame Xanadu
predicts them.</i>

14:01.257 --> 14:03.926
<i>But our efforts
will be for naught</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:08.681
unless all of you
stop Child herself.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.312
It pains me
to agree with Nabu,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.856
but he and the Stranger
are right.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.024
We have to go.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.158
Dang it!
Wrong heroes.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.885
Dang it!
They can't help either.

14:49.388 --> 14:54.435
Holy freakin' moly!
Child's reversed gravity.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.245
Is that the wizard?
I can't believe he's helping.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.665
Come. We must find Child.

15:23.922 --> 15:24.965
Dang it!

15:28.135 --> 15:31.639
Whoa!
This one's even bigger
than the one in Sydney.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.516
Better to destroy
the entire World Ocean.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.562
But Child
is already gone.
So we must follow.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.736
Oh!
I feel split in half.

15:45.819 --> 15:49.573
- I have to go
through this twice?

15:49.657 --> 15:53.160
Dang it! Whose idea was it
to split the Earth in two?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.248
Holy mo...

15:58.332 --> 15:59.708
Don't even say it.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.514
Child is gone.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.313
Finally we're safe.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.941
Dang it!
I keep seeing
the same heroes.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.449
Dang it.
Now I don't see
any heroes at all.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.879
Dang it!

16:49.341 --> 16:51.760
There are no other
heroes here yet.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.680
Dang it!

16:54.763 --> 16:57.391
That means
we're getting closer.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.103
Dang it!
Dang it! Dang it!

17:01.186 --> 17:03.480
But we're the only ones here.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.524
We have to stop and help.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.659
Follow the plan.
We need to be
where Child is now.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.163
Dang it.
That was them.
That's who I need.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.331
Oh, but not this soon.

17:39.183 --> 17:44.229
<i>The loss of my wife
sent me reeling, spinning.</i>

17:44.313 --> 17:48.776
<i>At Kent's suggestion,
and with his recommendation,</i>

17:48.859 --> 17:50.903
<i>I joined the Justice League.</i>

17:50.986 --> 17:56.200

mystic threats,
I no longer faced them alone.</i>

17:56.283 --> 17:58.660

<i>-and when I did travel...</i>

18:00.454 --> 18:02.706
<i>-...I brought Zatanna with me.</i>

18:02.790 --> 18:05.501
<i>And still, I was spinning.</i>

18:05.584 --> 18:12.341
<i>For just as I had been inspired
by Superman, Kent, and others
who had come before me,</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:19.556
<i>I, unfortunately,
had become an inspiration
to those coming after.</i>

18:19.640 --> 18:22.643
<i>Thus, in a moment of crisis,</i>

18:23.936 --> 18:26.814
<i>my little girl over-reached.</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:31.151
<i>And in that moment,
my compass ceased to spin.</i>

18:31.235 --> 18:34.780
Great Nabu,
release my daughter.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.407
No.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.954
<i>Then and there,
I knew exactly what I must do.</i>

18:42.037 --> 18:45.541
<i>As if my entire life
had been designed</i>

18:45.624 --> 18:51.630
<i>like perfect prestidigitation
to lead up to this very moment.</i>

18:51.713 --> 18:53.465
Take me instead.

18:56.134 --> 19:01.473
No, please!
This was my fault.
Dad, don't! Dad!

19:01.557 --> 19:03.559
<i>But to her,
it must have seemed</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:07.229
<i>as if I was abandoning
my girl once again,</i>

19:07.312 --> 19:10.732
<i>taking my show
on the road permanently.</i>

19:10.816 --> 19:17.531
<i>Giving her no more
than one hour of my time
and attention every year.</i>

19:17.614 --> 19:19.241
Daddy.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.994
<i>But I took on
this burden.</i>

19:22.077 --> 19:25.914
<i>Sacrificed myself
to save my daughter.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:39.344
Action!

19:39.428 --> 19:42.431
Captain, we're surrounded.
Shields are failing.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.809
There is only one way
to survive this.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.312
We must surrender.

19:48.395 --> 19:52.149
Cut!
Print. Perfect.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.782
Jeez! It's cold!

20:00.866 --> 20:04.119
Gut it out,
and follow the plan.
Now!

20:04.202 --> 20:06.079
My compliments, humans.

20:06.163 --> 20:10.959
Your species has done
a marvelous job
melting this polar ice cap.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.670
But I believe I can do better.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.838
Care to watch?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.761
You can't kill me!

20:20.844 --> 20:22.262
Power of Zeus!

20:25.557 --> 20:29.645
Child, your mayhem
on this world ends now.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.690
We will restore peace,
where you have wrought havoc,

20:33.774 --> 20:36.860
for we are
the defenders of Order,

20:36.944 --> 20:38.987
the conquerors of Chaos.

20:39.071 --> 20:44.660
And for you,
a fate worse than death.

20:56.338 --> 21:00.634
Ooh! Pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty!

21:16.733 --> 21:17.901
Like I said...

21:20.487 --> 21:23.156
You can't kill me!

21:23.240 --> 21:26.576
You can't kill me!

21:26.660 --> 21:30.956
But I can kill every
living thing on this world.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.428
Dang it!

21:47.305 --> 21:50.642
No, wait. This is it.
I found them.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.064
Dad.

22:04.656 --> 22:09.036
Why do you tell us
what we have no need to know.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.414
There must be a record.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.667
We both know
my body cannot last forever.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.253
But you and the Helmet
will endure.

22:18.336 --> 22:22.591
I tell you these things,
so that when the time comes,

22:22.674 --> 22:24.885
you may tell my daughter.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.512
That is not
our responsibility.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.931
It <i>is</i> your responsibility.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.060
As long as you hold
my body hostage,

22:33.143 --> 22:39.941
I charge you, Nabu,
pass these words, my story,
on to my daughter.

22:44.488 --> 22:48.909
Hmm, fine.
We will honor your wishes

22:48.992 --> 22:51.203
if that becomes necessary.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.790
Oh, it seems
quite necessary.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.625
For in this coming battle,

22:56.708 --> 23:00.128
I will not allow
my daughter to perish.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.172
And it will almost
certainly take

23:02.255 --> 23:06.468
all that remains
of my vim vitae,
my life force,

23:06.551 --> 23:09.137
for Doctor Fate to survive,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.973
let alone triumph.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.987
The Stranger
had the right idea.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.698
We're in a crisis situation.
Again.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.493
If we make it out of this,

23:31.576 --> 23:35.497
we can't rely on
another villain like Wizard
to come through for us.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.126
Jeff, I think we have to start
thinking about organizing

23:39.209 --> 23:41.878
a true Justice League
Reserves system.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.007
Unfortunately,
I have the feeling

23:46.091 --> 23:50.178
we're going to need it
more and more
in the days to come.
