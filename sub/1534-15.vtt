11:37.480 --> 11:38.879
look like child's play.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.848
<i>Ursula: It will punish all
of the enchanted forest,</i>

11:40.883 --> 11:42.316
including us.

11:42.351 --> 11:43.851
So what are you suggesting,

11:43.886 --> 11:46.153
that we storm the evil
queen's castle together?

11:46.189 --> 11:49.089
Ohh. If only your wits 
matched your looks.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.026
There is a magical tree
deep within the forest.

11:52.061 --> 11:54.195
The fairies call it the tree of wisdom.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.931
It will answer any question asked of it.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.168
Including a query about how to
defeat the queen and her curse.

12:01.204 --> 12:02.937
So why don't you ask it yourselves?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.939
The tree's knowledge is protected.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.740
Its wisdom can only be unlocked

12:06.776 --> 12:09.543
by two of the most Valiant heroes.

12:09.579 --> 12:11.412
Which is why you need us.

12:13.749 --> 12:16.250

12:16.285 --> 12:18.352

12:20.122 --> 12:23.390

This tree... if what
they say is true...

12:28.039 --> 12:30.998
[Whispering] We'll be able to defeat
the Evil Queen once and for all.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.333
[Whispering] But can we trust them?

12:32.368 --> 12:33.734
They're almost as bad as Regina.

12:33.769 --> 12:34.935
If she really has a
curse as dark as they say,

12:34.971 --> 12:36.670
the entire kingdom is in danger.

12:38.641 --> 12:40.874
What choice do we have?

12:55.157 --> 12:57.091
Belle said she checked the back.

12:57.126 --> 12:58.959
She's pretty sure there's
a wooden box missing.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.654
- What was inside it?
- She doesn't know.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.097
Well, let's find out.

13:03.132 --> 13:06.166
[Clicks switch, siren wailing]

13:20.449 --> 13:23.450
[Whirring]

13:23.486 --> 13:25.519
Is there a problem, sheriff chiseled chin?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.222
Step out of the vehicle, please.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.028

Emma: Anything?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.890
Car's clean.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.092
Weird.

14:05.127 --> 14:07.695
You think Belle just misplaced that box?

14:07.730 --> 14:10.564
Who knows? But we can't
arrest them for speculation.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.334
Looks like you guys are off the hook.

14:15.237 --> 14:16.928
Sorry.

14:16.928 --> 14:18.605
It would be nice if at
least one of the Charmings

14:18.641 --> 14:20.207
lived up to their family name.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.110
Maybe we should go back
to the sheriff's station,

14:23.145 --> 14:25.612
check out any security footage of Gold's,

14:25.648 --> 14:27.209
make sure they didn't take anything.

14:27.209 --> 14:29.316
Why don't you go ahead? I
wanna check on your mother.

14:29.352 --> 14:30.755
Mind dropping me at the
loft on the way back?

14:30.755 --> 14:31.780
Dad...

14:35.825 --> 14:37.057
Are you sure everything's okay?

14:37.093 --> 14:39.293
Emma, of course.

14:39.328 --> 14:40.494
[Chuckles] Let's go.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.436
[Car door closes]

14:57.015 --> 14:58.397
You found that in Cruella's car?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.527
David, that belonged to Maleficent,

15:00.527 --> 15:02.800
- you know how much that meant to her.
- I do.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.899
And I can only think of one reason

15:04.899 --> 15:07.262
why those two witches would
wanna steal a totem of hers...

15:08.021 --> 15:09.745
A spell. A spell to resurrect her.

15:11.357 --> 15:12.723
Is that even possible?

15:12.758 --> 15:13.991
You know, it doesn't matter

15:14.026 --> 15:15.292
what their dark magic can or can't do.

15:15.327 --> 15:17.995
Now that we have this,
it's not even an option.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.262
But what if they discover it's missing?

15:19.298 --> 15:21.565
Won't they just find something else?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.699
Then we take the one thing

15:22.735 --> 15:24.735
that Cruella and Ursula
can't do without...

15:24.770 --> 15:26.269
Maleficent's remains.

15:26.305 --> 15:28.205
Under the library. That's right.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.439
We find them, we dump them in the harbor,

15:29.475 --> 15:30.540
then she's gone forever.

15:30.576 --> 15:32.209
And once Ursula and Cruella realize that,

15:32.244 --> 15:33.477
maybe they'll leave town, too.

15:33.512 --> 15:35.712
And hopefully they'll
take our secret with them.

15:53.065 --> 15:55.932
Well, are they going
to let us cross or not?

15:55.968 --> 15:58.135
- Unfortunately not.
- [Cruella scoffs]

15:58.170 --> 16:00.570
You'd think traveling with
Snow White and Prince Charming

16:00.606 --> 16:02.239
would open some doors.

16:02.274 --> 16:03.407
Do they know who you are?

16:03.442 --> 16:04.674
<i>Yes, and they also know who you are,</i>

16:04.710 --> 16:06.610
so now we're just going to
have to find another route

16:06.645 --> 16:07.744
to the tree of wisdom.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.579
If we walk south, we can
circumvent the ravine.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.481
That will set us back two days.

16:11.517 --> 16:12.682
Perhaps you should show those guards

16:12.718 --> 16:15.085
just how skilled you are with your blade.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.753
Now those men are just
trying to do their duty.

16:16.789 --> 16:20.057
<i>And frankly, I would do exactly the same.</i>

16:24.129 --> 16:26.463

17:04.136 --> 17:06.703
I don't believe that
detour will be necessary.

17:08.773 --> 17:11.074
You should've given us
another chance to talk to them.

17:11.109 --> 17:12.476
Talk, talk, talk.

17:12.511 --> 17:15.444
You weren't willing to
do what was needed. I was.

Cruella: Oh, well done, darling.

17:18.617 --> 17:20.884
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

I didn't think so.

17:52.618 --> 17:54.384
A.T.M. Security footage.
We're trying to figure out

17:54.419 --> 17:56.386
if Ursula and Cruella stole
something from Gold's shop.

17:56.421 --> 17:58.288
Hmm. Oh! By the way,

17:58.323 --> 17:59.756
I never got the chance to ask you

17:59.791 --> 18:01.791
how exactly you knew Ursula.

18:01.827 --> 18:03.093
I already told you, luv.

Hey! Where you guys headed?

19:05.757 --> 19:07.324
Emma. What are you doing here?

19:07.359 --> 19:09.259
I found something on those women. Look.

19:09.294 --> 19:11.361
Looks like Belle was right.

19:11.396 --> 19:14.364
I think that's the box that's missing.

19:14.399 --> 19:15.999
It's enough to drag them
into the station, at least.

19:16.034 --> 19:17.434
Well, let's not jump the gun.

19:17.469 --> 19:18.835

realized that we needed

19:35.887 --> 19:37.320
to take a step back from our crusade.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.689
The truth is, we've been
going about this all wrong.

19:39.725 --> 19:41.224
When we knew those women
back in he enchanted forest,

19:41.260 --> 19:42.425
they were villains.

19:42.461 --> 19:43.927
And ever since they 
set foot in this town,

19:43.962 --> 19:45.895
that is exactly how we've treated them.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.330
Yeah, we chose to see the worst in them.

19:47.366 --> 19:49.899
But, Emma, if they're gonna have
a shot at redeeming themselves,

19:49.935 --> 19:51.868
we have to choose to see the best.

19:51.903 --> 19:54.804
You guys are seriously going for a hike?

19:54.840 --> 19:56.106
I know it might be hard to believe

19:56.141 --> 19:57.474
that we've backed off Ursula and Cruella,

19:57.509 --> 20:01.778
but your mother and I think
it's the right thing to do.

the right thing to do?

It's the only way to make sure
Emma doesn't find out the truth.

20:28.957 --> 20:31.486
Is anything coming 
back to you, Pinocchio?

20:35.710 --> 20:37.476

- It's not.

20:47.110 --> 20:49.121
But since you and August
spent so much time together,

I thought seeing you would...
[Whispers] Jog his memory.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.492
Yeah.

20:53.528 --> 20:55.794
I guess I could give it a shot.

Hey.

Come here.

21:05.506 --> 21:07.006

21:07.041 --> 21:08.707
You're Emma, the sheriff.

21:08.743 --> 21:12.645
But you know that back
when you were... O-older...

21:13.915 --> 21:15.247
We were friends.

21:15.283 --> 21:18.250
You were a really smart grown-up.

21:18.286 --> 21:20.819
So smart you knew how to
take that entire thing apart

21:20.855 --> 21:22.621
and add a story to it.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.791
And then you put it all back together.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.693
Do you remember doing that?

21:27.728 --> 21:29.762
Or anything else about the book?

21:33.401 --> 21:37.469
I know everybody wants me to remember,

21:37.505 --> 21:40.105
but... I just don't.

21:40.141 --> 21:43.375
You went to Phuket.

21:43.411 --> 21:46.679

wore leather and didn't shave!

21:55.923 --> 21:58.290
I won't have you speak that way to my boy.

21:58.326 --> 22:00.492
Maybe what your boy
needs is some motivation.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.194
Okay, Regina, that's enough.

22:02.230 --> 22:03.896
Let's go down to the vending machine

22:03.931 --> 22:05.231

this, uh, quest of yours is ill-fated?

else's happy ending,

deserve one of your own?

22:19.413 --> 22:21.847

same question, toy maker,

22:21.882 --> 22:23.582

22:23.618 --> 22:25.484
so you could send 
Pinocchio to this world.

if it wasn't for your curse!

my bucket list either.

It stops when we get
rid of Maleficent's ashes

23:57.778 --> 23:59.445
What now?

23:59.480 --> 24:03.682
I'm guessing this is how
we get the answers we need.

24:04.785 --> 24:06.885
Ready?

24:13.127 --> 24:15.461
How can we stop the Evil Queen's curse?

24:15.496 --> 24:18.430
<i>[Humming]</i>

24:22.903 --> 24:26.038
<i>[Vibrating]</i>

24:29.043 --> 24:30.142
[Both grunt]

24:30.177 --> 24:32.044
[Groans]

24:32.079 --> 24:34.713
Why didn't it answer our question?

24:34.749 --> 24:36.815
Those witches had to have lied.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.183
Do you think it's a trap?

24:38.219 --> 24:39.491
It's not a trap, my dear,

24:39.491 --> 24:41.253
- and we didn't lie about anything.
- [Blades zing]

24:44.091 --> 24:48.660
Perhaps you two aren't
as Valiant as we thought.

24:55.536 --> 24:59.104
David. [Whispers] There it it.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.373
Maleficent's ashes.

25:01.409 --> 25:03.242
[Gasps]

25:03.277 --> 25:04.676
We did it.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.011
We stopped them.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.946
Ursula: Not exactly.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.215
Uhh! Aah!

25:16.057 --> 25:17.090
[Scratching]

25:19.027 --> 25:20.093
[Scratching stops]

25:26.064 --> 25:28.998
Oh, I thought I made it clear.

25:29.033 --> 25:31.267
I don't want you near my boy.

25:31.302 --> 25:33.936
I didn't come here to talk to Pinocchio.

25:33.972 --> 25:36.239
I...I came to speak to you.

25:36.274 --> 25:39.142
If you want information about the book,

25:39.177 --> 25:40.443
August never told me nothing.

25:40.478 --> 25:42.378
Will you shut up and just let me finish?

25:42.413 --> 25:44.947
I'm trying to apologize.

25:44.983 --> 25:47.550
Well, go on. You're off
to an interesting start.

25:47.585 --> 25:52.021
Look, if someone talked to Henry
the way I spoke to your boy...

25:52.056 --> 25:55.391
[Scratching resumes] I would've
done a lot worse than yell at them.

25:57.095 --> 25:59.266
I know I was out of line.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.999
It's just, every time
I seem to make progress

26:03.034 --> 26:05.668
towards my happy ending,

26:05.703 --> 26:08.704
I hit another dead end.

26:10.742 --> 26:13.676
But I know I'll never find
it if I revert to my old ways.

26:13.711 --> 26:14.944
So...

26:17.549 --> 26:19.615
I'm sorry.

26:24.589 --> 26:25.688
Wait.

26:36.234 --> 26:39.502
After the blur fairy turned
August back into a boy,

26:39.537 --> 26:42.038
I kept everything he brought to town,

26:42.073 --> 26:45.775
just in case he remembered
the man he used to be.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.215
Perhaps, uh, something I here

26:52.250 --> 26:55.851
will help you find what
you are looking for.

26:59.824 --> 27:03.125
If my boy can't help you with this,

27:03.161 --> 27:05.127
perhaps yours can.

27:08.866 --> 27:11.601
Good luck. [Sniffles]

27:23.114 --> 27:26.215
I trust they don't suspect
my hand in all this.

27:26.251 --> 27:29.418
They had no reason to.

27:29.454 --> 27:31.854
And Belle?

27:31.889 --> 27:34.757
Did she have any suspicions
while you were in my shop?

27:34.792 --> 27:36.859
You mean, did she ask about you?

27:36.894 --> 27:38.794
She didn't even mention 
your name, darling.

27:38.830 --> 27:41.364
I'd say she's moved on.

27:47.572 --> 27:48.838
[Click]

27:51.175 --> 27:52.908
You know what you must do.

28:01.853 --> 28:03.953
Snow: We were fools to
think we could work together.

28:03.988 --> 28:05.354
Step aside and let us pass.

28:05.390 --> 28:06.455
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

28:06.491 --> 28:07.726
[Swords clatter]

28:07.726 --> 28:09.492
No one's leaving until we figure out

28:09.527 --> 28:12.461
why the tree didn't 
answer your question.

28:12.497 --> 28:14.664
Perhaps we got the rules wrong, darling.

28:14.699 --> 28:16.499
Maleficent: No. The plan 
should've worked.

28:16.534 --> 28:17.967
Unless there was some interference,

28:18.002 --> 28:20.503
unless the tree sensed...

28:21.489 --> 28:22.672
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

28:22.707 --> 28:24.974
How did I not see it sooner?

28:25.009 --> 28:27.143
The sparkle in your eyes,

28:27.178 --> 28:29.278
the glow of your Snow White skin...

28:29.314 --> 28:31.714
You're positively radiant, my dear.

28:33.017 --> 28:36.485
You don't know?

28:36.521 --> 28:39.388
You're carrying a child.

28:41.059 --> 28:42.758
What?

28:42.794 --> 28:44.160
We are?

28:44.195 --> 28:47.763
That's why the tree of
wisdom knocked you back.

28:47.799 --> 28:49.332
[Whispers] We're going to be parents.

28:49.367 --> 28:51.233
What does all this have
to do with the tree?

28:51.269 --> 28:53.736
Why would our child prevent
us from getting an answer?

28:53.771 --> 28:55.204
<i>You may be heroes,</i>

28:55.239 --> 28:57.773
but that doesn't mean your child will be.

28:57.809 --> 28:58.874
Careful, witch.

29:00.611 --> 29:03.446
Your child is the product of true love,

29:03.481 --> 29:06.649
which means it could
grow to be a powerful hero

29:06.684 --> 29:08.818
capable of great good.

29:08.853 --> 29:11.654
But with the potential for that good

29:11.689 --> 29:13.356
also comes something else.

29:13.391 --> 29:14.924
What?

29:14.959 --> 29:17.593
The potential for great darkness.

29:17.628 --> 29:20.463
Your child might turn out to be

29:20.498 --> 29:23.899
just like us.

29:23.935 --> 29:26.702
You mean a...

29:26.738 --> 29:28.104
A villain.

29:28.139 --> 29:32.308
Darker than any this realm has ever seen.

29:32.343 --> 29:33.856
Come, ladies.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.478
Seems we'll have to find another way

29:35.513 --> 29:37.313
to evade Regina's dark curse.

29:37.348 --> 29:38.914
Can I choke them first?

29:38.950 --> 29:40.950
My tentacles are bored.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.186
I have a feeling

29:44.222 --> 29:46.255
they have plenty of
suffering in their future.

29:46.290 --> 29:48.257
Let's go.

29:57.568 --> 29:58.701
[Slices]

29:58.736 --> 30:00.536
[Gasps] Ah!

30:00.571 --> 30:02.471
- [Slices]
- [Gasps and groans]

30:04.675 --> 30:07.309
[Sizzling]

30:07.345 --> 30:08.544
What the hell did you do?

30:08.579 --> 30:10.579
The dark magic we're
using to raise Maleficent

30:10.615 --> 30:13.082
doesn't require some silly
little trinket from Gold's shop.

30:13.117 --> 30:15.484
No, that was just a ruse
to get you down here.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.721
We need something 
with a little more kick.

30:18.001 --> 30:20.123
Ursula: The blood from the
people who wronged her most.

30:20.123 --> 30:20.999
[Ground rumbling]

30:21.092 --> 30:22.425
[Wind whistling] We're too late.

30:22.460 --> 30:24.560

30:27.331 --> 30:31.867

[Inhales sharply]

30:50.955 --> 30:52.588
[Exhales deeply]

30:54.158 --> 30:57.059
It's good to be back.

30:59.183 --> 31:01.172
Whatever it is you think we did,

31:01.172 --> 31:02.440
you don't know the whole story.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.639
I know enough.

31:03.674 --> 31:05.197
Patience, Mal. We have a plan.

31:05.401 --> 31:06.567
You wanna hurt someone?

31:06.602 --> 31:08.836
Well, hurt me. Leave David alone.

31:08.871 --> 31:10.705
Hurt you?

31:10.740 --> 31:12.406
No.

31:12.442 --> 31:15.176
That would be far too easy.

31:15.211 --> 31:17.712
You're going to tell
everyone what we did first.

31:17.747 --> 31:19.313
I don't care about your secret.

31:19.349 --> 31:21.682
You can keep it as long as you like.

31:21.718 --> 31:24.785
I only care about one thing...

31:24.821 --> 31:26.487
your pain,

31:26.522 --> 31:30.124
and that it be as long and terrible

31:30.159 --> 31:33.260
and unyielding as my own.

31:33.296 --> 31:35.996
<i>The pain you caused.</i>

31:36.032 --> 31:37.565
I forgot how much I missed her.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.899
It's going to be entertaining.

31:38.935 --> 31:42.303
I'm gonna revel in 
every torturous moment.

31:42.338 --> 31:46.173
And you? You're gonna
watch your world crumble.

31:48.644 --> 31:50.578
See you soon, dears.

31:53.616 --> 31:55.449
[Whispers] This is all our fault.

31:55.485 --> 32:00.521
If hadn't been so determined
to keep our secret...

32:00.556 --> 32:02.523
If we'd just asked for help...

32:02.558 --> 32:04.892
You're right.

32:04.927 --> 32:07.194
We can't keep lying.

32:08.931 --> 32:11.098
We have to tell Emma everything.

32:18.007 --> 32:19.451
Well, Swan, why did you summon me?

32:21.218 --> 32:23.577
Because I know there's something
about your past with Ursula

32:23.613 --> 32:26.380
you're not telling me.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.082
And that's okay.

32:29.986 --> 32:33.020
What's not okay is you
lying to me about it.

32:36.159 --> 32:37.491
Aye, luv, you're right.

32:39.028 --> 32:42.496
I haven't been entirely
forthright with you.

32:42.532 --> 32:46.867
Truth is, I remember
my history with Ursula.

32:46.903 --> 32:48.269
It was ugly.

32:48.304 --> 32:49.637
Did you break her heart?

32:51.007 --> 32:52.106
Worse.

32:55.244 --> 32:57.411
[Whispers] Look...

32:57.447 --> 33:01.515
Whatever you did, you're
not that person anymore.

33:01.551 --> 33:04.919
It's not gonna change 
anything between us.

33:04.954 --> 33:08.656
That's quite a lot of faith
you're putting on me, Swan.

33:08.691 --> 33:10.024
[Folder thuds]

33:10.059 --> 33:12.626
I know, and there's a reason for it.

33:14.697 --> 33:16.897
What's that?

33:16.933 --> 33:18.766
My parents.

33:18.801 --> 33:21.277
I had this moment today
where I doubted them.

33:21.927 --> 33:23.171
They said they were going for a hike,

33:23.171 --> 33:24.638
and I actually thought
they were lying to me.

33:24.674 --> 33:25.773
Were they?

33:25.808 --> 33:27.341
No. Of course not.

33:27.376 --> 33:28.876
My parents would never lie to me.

33:28.911 --> 33:32.112
But the fact that I could
think that they would,

33:32.148 --> 33:35.616
it reminded me that I
have this tendency to...

33:35.651 --> 33:37.885
Expect the worst of people.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.688
In my childhood...

33:40.723 --> 33:41.956
People were always letting me down,

33:41.991 --> 33:43.090
- and I...
- Hey.

33:43.125 --> 33:46.060
I don't intend to let you down.

33:46.095 --> 33:48.295
I know.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.034
And I know whatever happened
with that sea witch...

33:54.070 --> 33:55.970
[Whispers] You can tell
me on your own time.

33:58.174 --> 33:59.373
Because no matter what, 
I gonna do what...

33:59.408 --> 34:00.975
[Whispering] My parents always do.

34:02.778 --> 34:05.913
I'm gonna choose to see the best in you.

34:10.887 --> 34:12.186
And I with you.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.092
[Clears throat]

34:19.128 --> 34:20.360
Uh, sorry.

34:20.396 --> 34:23.030
We just... didn't want to interrupt.

34:23.065 --> 34:25.866
So you awkwardly stood there to watch?

34:25.902 --> 34:27.400
Next time, interrupt. [Chuckles]

34:27.436 --> 34:28.835
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

34:28.871 --> 34:32.639
It turns Cruella and
Ursula were up to something.

34:32.675 --> 34:34.208
They resurrected Maleficent.

34:34.243 --> 34:36.710
The dragon that I slayed
under the clock tower?

34:36.746 --> 34:39.780
Dragon? I thought she was
some sort of mummified beast.

34:39.815 --> 34:42.283
Well, whatever she was, she's
back to her old self now.

34:42.318 --> 34:44.118
And as long as she's
in town, no one is safe.

34:44.152 --> 34:47.521
I don't get it. Why are these
witches waging war against us?

34:49.891 --> 34:50.958
[Sighs]

34:50.993 --> 34:53.594
Because they're villains,

34:53.629 --> 34:55.362
and we're heroes.

35:04.974 --> 35:06.473
[Inhales sharply]

35:06.509 --> 35:08.008
Charming, wake up. He won't, dear.

35:08.044 --> 35:09.577
At least, not until morning.

35:09.612 --> 35:11.378
W-what are you doing?

35:11.414 --> 35:13.948
Why are you here? Where are your friends?

35:13.983 --> 35:16.016
They don't know I'm paying you a visit.

35:16.052 --> 35:18.586
There's a reason I came to you alone.

35:18.621 --> 35:20.287
Why?

35:20.323 --> 35:24.391
Because you and 
I have something in common,

35:24.427 --> 35:26.860
something those two 
would never understand.

35:28.264 --> 35:32.366
You and I are about to be mothers.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.368
[Whispers] You're pregnant?

35:34.403 --> 35:38.572
Now you get why we must stop this curse.

35:38.608 --> 35:40.874
For our children.

35:40.910 --> 35:45.245
If we work together, we will
find a way to defeat Regina.

35:46.716 --> 35:48.782
[Sighs]

35:48.818 --> 35:50.618
No.

35:50.653 --> 35:52.386
What?

35:52.421 --> 35:54.021
Not with you.

35:54.056 --> 35:55.956
Why not?

35:57.426 --> 35:59.593
Because of what you are.

35:59.629 --> 36:02.763
If we succumb to darkness
just to defeat this curse,

36:02.798 --> 36:06.200
our child will be doomed
to that darkness as well.

36:06.235 --> 36:07.835
You would risk the kingdom

36:07.870 --> 36:10.638
to ensure your child grows up a hero?

36:12.108 --> 36:15.643
<i>Charming and I will win,</i>

36:15.678 --> 36:19.580
but we won't compromise
who we are to do it.

36:19.615 --> 36:22.616
I won't become like you.

36:22.652 --> 36:24.385
[Thunderclap]

36:29.992 --> 36:31.692
[Car door opens]

36:36.766 --> 36:40.167
What's with all the
cloak-and-dagger?

36:40.202 --> 36:43.270
Maleficent's back.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.173
[Exhales sharply] I should've known

36:46.208 --> 36:47.741
fish sticks and pound puppy were here

36:47.777 --> 36:49.209
for more than a second chance.

36:49.245 --> 36:51.979
They wanna destroy our happy endings.

36:52.014 --> 36:53.113
All of them.

36:53.149 --> 36:55.416
How do they hope to do that?

36:55.451 --> 36:57.451
That's where you come in.

36:57.486 --> 36:59.520
We need to find out 
what they're planning.

36:59.555 --> 37:01.455
We need to get someone close to them,

37:01.490 --> 37:03.060
someone they believe to be a villain.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.992
We want you to go undercover with them

37:05.027 --> 37:06.360
and help us stop their plans.

37:06.395 --> 37:08.529
And you think they're just going to

37:08.564 --> 37:10.487
welcome me into 
their coven with open arms?

37:10.487 --> 37:12.266
Regina, you used to be one of them.

37:12.301 --> 37:14.868
They think I'm a hero now.
They'll never believe I want in.

37:14.904 --> 37:16.970
So find a way to make them believe.

37:20.409 --> 37:23.343
What makes you so sure they're
dead set on destroying us?

37:25.581 --> 37:28.849
Because of something David
and I did a long time ago.

37:34.690 --> 37:37.424
Regina, you once asked me to...

37:41.964 --> 37:44.531
Regina, you once asked me...
[Whispers] To keep a secret.

37:46.035 --> 37:47.468
And I couldn't.

37:49.538 --> 37:51.905
But I'm gonna ask 
you to keep one for me.

37:53.242 --> 37:56.510
One Emma can never learn.

37:58.848 --> 38:01.248
What is it?

38:04.053 --> 38:08.422
Emma was born with the
potential for great darkness.

38:08.457 --> 38:11.692
She's the savior. A hero.

38:11.727 --> 38:13.227
Her magic's as light as it gets.

38:13.262 --> 38:15.395
Because David and I went
to extraordinary lengths

38:15.431 --> 38:17.564
to make sure it was.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.801
If you ensured her goodness,
why can't you tell her?

38:20.836 --> 38:23.704
The same reason you don't
want Henry to hear about

38:23.739 --> 38:26.707
all the terrible things
you did in your past.

38:28.811 --> 38:31.545
<i>Mary Margaret: You wanna protect him...</i>

38:35.618 --> 38:39.286
<i>So he doesn't lose faith in
the person you've become...</i>

38:40.856 --> 38:45.526
<i>The person he always believed you could be.</i>

38:48.864 --> 38:52.900
<i>That's why Emma can never find
out what I'm about to tell you.</i>

38:54.670 --> 38:58.605
<i>She's finally starting
to open up her heart.</i>

38:58.641 --> 39:00.507
<i>And if she learns the truth,</i>

39:00.543 --> 39:02.242
<i>if we let her down,</i>

39:02.278 --> 39:04.812
<i>she'll lose faith in us,</i>

39:04.847 --> 39:08.215
<i>and it could send her
tumbling down a dark path.</i>

39:19.061 --> 39:22.262
<i>Because when you betray
the people you love...</i>

39:24.166 --> 39:28.435
<i>When you make them see
the worst parts of you...</i>

39:31.373 --> 39:35.542
<i>What you've done changes everything.</i>

39:46.455 --> 39:49.590
<i>There's no going back.</i>

39:55.564 --> 39:59.600
<i>You've shattered the bonds
you worked so hard to forge.</i>

40:04.240 --> 40:07.841
<i>And the stronger 
those bonds once were...</i>

40:07.877 --> 40:10.744
<i>[Whoosh]</i>

40:15.150 --> 40:18.385
<i>The more difficult they
are to put back together...</i>

40:26.295 --> 40:28.095
[Rattles]

40:32.067 --> 40:34.501
<i>If they can be repaired at all.</i>

40:44.902 --> 40:47.103
I don't understand.

40:48.973 --> 40:50.562
<i>What exactly did you do to Maleficent?</i>

40:55.065 --> 40:56.786
[Whispers] Because of us...

40:59.011 --> 41:00.462
Maleficent lost her child.
