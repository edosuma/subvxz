00:00.398 --> 00:02.481
<i>Previously on When Calls the Heart...</i>

00:02.506 --> 00:06.233
<i>It's been four months since
little Jack Thornton was born.</i>

00:06.525 --> 00:08.125
I still can't believe the telephone

00:08.151 --> 00:09.710
is coming to Hope Valley.

00:09.787 --> 00:11.826
I'm here to fix your switchboard.

00:12.148 --> 00:13.947
Trying to set us up as a couple.

00:13.972 --> 00:17.029
Doesn't she realize how
ridiculous that would be?

00:17.054 --> 00:19.047
I see a life with you.

00:19.897 --> 00:22.867
I just wanna be in a better
position, money-wise.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.763
I've slung my last beer.

00:24.788 --> 00:25.890
Who did you sell it to?

00:25.922 --> 00:27.164
An out-of-town buyer.

00:27.189 --> 00:29.692
I just sold it for $10,000
five minutes ago.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.579
<i>It's been a little over a year</i>

00:31.604 --> 00:33.873
<i>since you were taken from me, Jack.</i>

00:34.063 --> 00:35.932
<i>I think of you always.</i>

00:35.965 --> 00:39.069
<i>More and more I can focus on
the joy I felt in your love</i>

00:39.102 --> 00:42.016
<i>rather than the grief I
suffered in your passing.</i>

00:42.381 --> 00:45.804
<i>Even though our son can't
fully comprehend my words,</i>

00:45.829 --> 00:48.517
<i>I talk to him about you all the time.</i>

00:48.642 --> 00:51.089
<i>I'm sure he'll grow up
proud to be your son</i>

00:51.114 --> 00:52.922
<i>And love you as I do.</i>

00:53.159 --> 00:55.395
<i>And you will be proud of him.</i>

00:55.585 --> 00:58.921
<i>Like you, he will be a man
of honour and integrity.</i>

00:58.989 --> 01:01.608
<i>And he will have the
capacity for eternal love.</i>

01:05.726 --> 01:07.063
I didn't think I could love anyone

01:07.096 --> 01:09.396
as much as I loved your father.

01:10.249 --> 01:11.884
But here you are.

01:12.051 --> 01:15.287
Part him, part me.

01:15.655 --> 01:17.141
All you.

01:21.046 --> 01:22.652
It's warm today.

01:22.677 --> 01:24.803
Maybe take Jack outside.

01:24.828 --> 01:26.354
I was planning on it.

01:26.379 --> 01:28.234
But be sure to bundle him
if it gets too breezy

01:28.259 --> 01:30.425
and shaded if it gets too sunny.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.197
Don't worry, Mrs. Thornton.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.794
He'll be fine.

01:34.243 --> 01:36.026
I know he will.

01:36.274 --> 01:38.315
You're really wonderful
with him, Laura.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.349
He's such a sweet baby.

01:43.754 --> 01:45.787
Be good, sweet boy.

01:57.402 --> 01:58.372
Oh, no, no.

01:58.397 --> 02:00.141
Wait, I-I asked for over-easy.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.321
These are like rubber.

02:01.346 --> 02:04.979
No, they're like how
I always cook them.

02:05.296 --> 02:07.499
Bill, you have been in a mood all week.

02:07.524 --> 02:09.096
This wouldn't have anything
to do with you losing out

02:09.121 --> 02:10.859
on the saloon, would it?

02:11.356 --> 02:13.603
Well, you have to admit
it's a bit peculiar.

02:13.639 --> 02:16.207
This guy just swoops in out of nowhere?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.253
And how would he even know
the saloon's for sale?

02:18.278 --> 02:19.980
And he bought it site unseen?

02:20.005 --> 02:21.970
Now this mystery man owns
one of Hope Valley's

02:21.995 --> 02:23.305
largest establishments.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.037
And who knows what he's
going to do with it.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.671
Someone should have
looked into this man

02:26.707 --> 02:28.877
before the sale was
allowed to go through.

02:28.956 --> 02:32.418
Florence, Tom was free to
sell to whomever he wished.

02:46.157 --> 02:47.414
Thank you.

02:47.439 --> 02:49.208
I couldn't help but overhear.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.164
This new saloon owner sounds
like a rogue and a scoundrel

02:52.196 --> 02:55.344
and I for one think a tar and
feathering might be in order.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.792
You wouldn't happen to be
this new owner by any chance?

03:00.234 --> 03:03.171
Lucas Bouchard, at your service.

03:33.882 --> 03:39.632
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

03:40.486 --> 03:42.810
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.
Bouchard.

03:42.835 --> 03:43.736
Likewise.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.382
I'm afraid you have
me at a disadvantage.

03:45.407 --> 03:46.540
Abigail Stanton.

03:46.565 --> 03:48.567
The Abigail, of cafe fame?

03:48.592 --> 03:50.077
One and the same.

03:51.204 --> 03:52.383
Lucas Bouchard.

03:52.421 --> 03:53.473
Bill Avery.

03:53.498 --> 03:55.429
Sheriff Bill Avery.

03:55.507 --> 03:56.823
Always good to get off
on the right foot

03:56.848 --> 03:58.281
with local law enforcement.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.691
I agree.

04:00.068 --> 04:02.878
So where do you hail from, Mr.
Bouchard?

04:03.516 --> 04:05.770
The previous owner, he
left pretty quickly

04:05.795 --> 04:08.675
and, well, frankly he didn't
tell us much about you.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.117
There's not much to tell, really.

04:10.142 --> 04:11.473
I'm a bit of a tumbleweed.

04:11.579 --> 04:13.164
From?

04:13.833 --> 04:15.382
Here and there.

04:15.899 --> 04:18.111
How did you hear about the saloon?

04:18.168 --> 04:21.137
I always keep an eye open for
good investment opportunities.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.727
So you're a businessman.

04:22.785 --> 04:24.712
Among other things.

04:24.836 --> 04:27.038
Mrs. Stanton, thank you for
an excellent breakfast,

04:27.119 --> 04:29.806
and by the way, as one
business owner to another,

04:29.831 --> 04:31.805
how is the local mayor to work with?

04:31.952 --> 04:35.480
Well, I think you will find her
to be a very reasonable person.

04:37.336 --> 04:39.731
Well, touchÃ©, Madam Mayor.

04:40.929 --> 04:42.731
I trust we'll be seeing
a lot of each other.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.352
You can count on it.

04:44.731 --> 04:48.245
If you'll excuse me I have
to get back to my saloon.

04:48.270 --> 04:50.005
I have a grand opening to plan.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.699
Friday evening the
whole town is invited.

04:56.717 --> 04:58.886
Well, I'm guessing your eggs
won't be tasting better

04:58.911 --> 05:00.712
any time soon.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.308
Good morning.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.657
For you, Mrs. Thornton.

05:08.682 --> 05:10.585
Oh, Opal, they're beautiful.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.112
You can take them home so
baby Jack can see them, too.

05:13.137 --> 05:14.441
That's a wonderful idea.

05:14.466 --> 05:17.071
I will put them in water right
away to keep them fresh.

05:17.272 --> 05:18.568
Thank you.

05:18.593 --> 05:19.953
<i>Wait up Timmy, we're coming!</i>

05:19.978 --> 05:21.468
<i>Hey, Timmy.</i>

05:25.811 --> 05:27.480
Boy, those are some bikes.

05:27.505 --> 05:28.229
Thanks.

05:28.254 --> 05:29.532
You can ride mine if you want.

05:29.557 --> 05:31.846
<i>Thanks, but that's ok.</i>

05:35.654 --> 05:37.431
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.703
Well, that was very nice of Cody.

05:41.338 --> 05:42.605
You know, school doesn't
start for a few minutes

05:42.630 --> 05:44.816
if you wanna take one
of these for a spin.

05:45.394 --> 05:46.851
I don't know how.

05:46.876 --> 05:49.642
I tried once before, but
I fell and cut my knee.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.179
Oh.

05:51.379 --> 05:54.148
Well, what if at recess
I help you learn?

05:54.173 --> 05:55.089
Would you?

05:55.114 --> 05:56.505
Mmmhmm.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.967
Come on.

06:00.551 --> 06:02.076
Thanks for your help, Fiona.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.330
It's nice to get away from the
switchboard for a minute.

06:05.409 --> 06:07.441
Have you got to know
some people in town?

06:07.466 --> 06:08.800
Some.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.324
Others just stare.

06:12.349 --> 06:14.947
Well, the telephone has
caused quite a stir.

06:14.986 --> 06:17.143
I don't think it's about the telephone.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.847
Oh, what do you mean?

06:19.048 --> 06:21.368
Small towns are famous for gossip.

06:21.393 --> 06:22.975
That's why I prefer the city.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.507
Gossip, you say?

06:24.532 --> 06:27.329
Do you wanna know who the
real gossips in town are?

06:29.899 --> 06:31.412
Think that's the new owner?

06:31.437 --> 06:34.343
Well, he carries himself
like he's got deep pockets.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.878
I wish you'd have got it, Henry.

06:38.186 --> 06:40.473
Well, something else will come along.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.360
Always does.

06:52.429 --> 06:53.264
Shall we?

06:53.289 --> 06:54.391
Yeah.

07:11.046 --> 07:13.396
Faith, Rosemary!

07:16.045 --> 07:17.447
I've been thinking of you.

07:17.472 --> 07:19.041
Oh?

07:19.506 --> 07:22.194
Well, you and Carson
to be more precise.

07:22.219 --> 07:24.091
Rosemary, there is no me and Carson

07:24.116 --> 07:26.053
except as doctor and nurse.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.033
I always say where there is a spark

07:28.058 --> 07:30.860
somebody is bound to
be carrying a torch.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.589
There is definitely a spark
between you and Carson.

07:33.614 --> 07:35.605
You two are perfect for each other.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.380
Apparently not.

07:37.405 --> 07:38.503
What does that mean?

07:38.528 --> 07:41.782
He said the whole idea of us
as a couple was ridiculous.

07:41.807 --> 07:43.543
Ridiculous?

07:44.132 --> 07:46.320
That's ridiculous.

07:46.345 --> 07:48.100
I will call his "ridiculous"

07:48.125 --> 07:50.146
and raise him an "out of the question".

07:50.171 --> 07:53.675
Faith, I find gambling
references rarely helpful

07:53.700 --> 07:54.993
in matters of the heart.

07:55.018 --> 07:57.156
Well, that is the end of it
as far as I'm concerned.

07:57.181 --> 07:58.815
Never say never.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.329
Rosemary, you should let it go.

08:01.354 --> 08:02.908
Never.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.988
I know I'm right about this, Faith.

08:05.013 --> 08:06.581
Mmmhmm.

08:08.576 --> 08:09.700
Hello.

08:09.725 --> 08:10.693
Oh.

08:10.802 --> 08:11.736
I'm Fiona.

08:11.761 --> 08:12.997
Mrs. Blakely.

08:13.030 --> 08:15.372
Ah, so you're Florence.

08:15.594 --> 08:16.863
A little bird told me about you.

08:16.888 --> 08:17.952
What little bird?

08:17.977 --> 08:19.012
What did they say?

08:19.037 --> 08:20.371
All good things.

08:20.506 --> 08:22.375
I started with the phone company
right out of high school

08:22.400 --> 08:24.930
and the first thing I
learned was to be discreet.

08:25.424 --> 08:26.758
You want to see how it works?

08:26.911 --> 08:30.380
You listen through the receiver
and talk into the mouth piece.

08:30.405 --> 08:31.349
When you want to make a call

08:31.374 --> 08:34.917
you jiggle the switch hook a
couple of times... like this,

08:34.942 --> 08:37.025
to get my attention at the switchboard.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.374
You give me the number you
wanna call and I connect you.

08:40.456 --> 08:41.975
Simple.

08:42.126 --> 08:45.129
Well, it seems a little
too modern for my liking.

08:45.154 --> 08:48.470
Ah, well that's a pity
because the telephone

08:48.495 --> 08:51.063
is such a wonderful way
to share with friends

08:51.088 --> 08:53.697
the things you find out
talking to other friends.

08:54.725 --> 08:57.519
Show me... one more time.

09:00.934 --> 09:01.980
Hold on to this.

09:02.005 --> 09:03.006
Mmmhmm.

09:03.031 --> 09:05.614
Well... In here?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.088
So who do we have next?

09:08.970 --> 09:11.409
Mrs. Peterson's bunions
are acting up again.

09:11.434 --> 09:14.684
Ah, she doesn't need a doctor as
much as she needs bigger shoes.

09:15.325 --> 09:16.833
You're probably right.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.527
Is um... is everything ok?

09:19.859 --> 09:21.311
Of course, why?

09:21.336 --> 09:23.176
You don't quite seem yourself lately.

09:23.476 --> 09:24.837
Same old me.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.714
I'll see her in.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.436
<i>We're ready to see you now.</i>

09:30.593 --> 09:31.831
What if I fall?

09:31.856 --> 09:33.026
Oh, you won't fall.

09:33.051 --> 09:34.977
I'll hold on until you
find your balance.

09:35.002 --> 09:36.674
That's how everyone learns.

09:36.699 --> 09:38.696
There you go, hop up.

09:40.432 --> 09:41.931
Great.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.027
Now try peddling.

09:46.825 --> 09:49.068
Ooh, you're doing great! Do not steer.

09:49.093 --> 09:50.880
Ok, I'm going to let go now.

09:51.726 --> 09:53.153
Don't let go.

09:53.439 --> 09:56.405
Alright, I'll hold on
until you're ready.

10:01.421 --> 10:03.110
There we go, you've got it.

10:03.135 --> 10:04.733
You've got it.

10:05.768 --> 10:07.677
I think I did something stupid.

10:07.702 --> 10:08.931
Uh-oh.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.091
The other night after
dinner at your place-

10:11.319 --> 10:13.141
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.479
Rosemary has got a bee in her
bonnet about you and Faith.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.811
Yeah, I think that's pretty obvious.

10:18.836 --> 10:20.304
It made things awkward for you two?

10:20.329 --> 10:23.126
No, I'm afraid I'm the one
who made things awkward.

10:23.151 --> 10:24.880
Oh, how so?

10:25.014 --> 10:27.170
Well, after Faith and I
left we were talking about

10:27.195 --> 10:29.032
the idea of her and I being together.

10:29.057 --> 10:30.144
Hmm.

10:30.169 --> 10:33.209
And I might have used
the word "ridiculous".

10:34.220 --> 10:35.246
Bad choice.

10:35.271 --> 10:36.466
I know. I don't even
know why I said it,

10:36.491 --> 10:38.053
that's not the way I think at all.

10:38.078 --> 10:40.190
Well, forget about what you think.

10:40.295 --> 10:42.020
What do you feel?

10:42.987 --> 10:44.100
I like her.

10:44.125 --> 10:44.958
Uh-huh.

10:44.983 --> 10:46.219
And we get along.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.873
You get along?

10:47.929 --> 10:49.692
I feel a "but" coming
in here somewhere.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.864
We work together.

10:50.889 --> 10:53.404
I try not to think
about her in that way.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.008
Ok, word of advice.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.568
An attractive woman like Faith

10:57.593 --> 11:00.194
is not going to be available forever.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.579
Just something to think about.

11:10.665 --> 11:12.270
Shrimp? Caviar?

11:12.295 --> 11:13.981
That's pretty fancy stuff.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.575
For the grand opening.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.493
Everything's on the house.

11:18.397 --> 11:20.785
I hope you'll be able to attend, Mr...

11:21.020 --> 11:22.066
Free?

11:22.091 --> 11:22.849
Mr. Free.

11:22.874 --> 11:25.121
No, it's-it's Yost.

11:25.146 --> 11:26.913
But I will be there.

11:31.644 --> 11:32.648
Hello.

11:32.673 --> 11:34.808
Lucas Bouchard, saloon proprietor.

11:35.104 --> 11:36.471
Fiona Miller.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.502
I operate the telephone switchboard.

11:38.604 --> 11:40.106
You're a handy person to know.

11:40.131 --> 11:42.525
Actually, I'm not sure
how long I'll be here.

11:42.550 --> 11:45.244
The telephone company sent me to
get everything up and running.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.007
I'm based in San Francisco.

11:47.793 --> 11:49.213
San Francisco.

11:49.238 --> 11:50.940
I hear that's a wonderful town.

11:50.965 --> 11:51.981
I think so.

11:52.006 --> 11:54.350
But then I was born and raised there.

11:54.778 --> 11:56.013
Never been?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.180
Forgive me, Ms. Miller, I
really should be going.

11:58.205 --> 11:59.855
Masses to do.

12:00.121 --> 12:02.526
Hope to see you at the
opening Friday night.

12:03.315 --> 12:04.883
Perhaps.

12:06.316 --> 12:07.918
Mr. Yost.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.518
That'll be a nickel.

12:25.981 --> 12:28.538
Well, it's good he's employing people.

12:28.563 --> 12:31.278
Something about this guy
that doesn't sit right.

12:31.961 --> 12:33.637
I think he's very charming.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.130
He's too charming.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.559
Oh, Bill. Give him a chance.

12:37.779 --> 12:39.280
That's just it, Abigail.

12:39.305 --> 12:41.359
A chance to do what, exactly?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.829
Morning, ladies.

12:56.822 --> 12:58.856
<i>Be careful with that big one.
It's fragile.</i>

12:58.881 --> 13:00.162
_

13:00.629 --> 13:01.960
Morning, Miss.

13:02.686 --> 13:04.424
You're going to apply, I hope.

13:04.972 --> 13:06.174
That depends.

13:06.199 --> 13:07.534
What's the position?

13:07.559 --> 13:08.255
Waitress.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.382
I see.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.344
And the qualifications?

13:11.730 --> 13:15.881
Intelligence, independence,
personality.

13:16.683 --> 13:18.167
I'd say you're perfect.

13:18.247 --> 13:19.823
You don't even know me.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.332
I can read people.

13:21.357 --> 13:22.507
It's what I do.

13:22.532 --> 13:24.267
Well, I prefer reading books.

13:24.292 --> 13:25.493
See?

13:25.518 --> 13:26.586
You're intelligent.

13:26.611 --> 13:27.912
I knew it.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.460
So, what about it?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.769
What if I turn out to be a clumsy oaf

13:33.794 --> 13:35.930
who spills beer everywhere?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.529
I refuse to believe
that that is possible.

13:39.092 --> 13:40.934
The job is yours if you want it.

13:41.090 --> 13:43.375
It's a very tempting offer but-

13:43.400 --> 13:44.565
<i>Hi Mrs. Thornton.</i>

13:44.590 --> 13:45.434
Hi boys.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.219
I'll see you at school.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.434
You're the school teacher.

13:49.467 --> 13:50.103
Mmmhmm.

13:50.128 --> 13:52.779
And it's Mrs, not Miss.

13:52.804 --> 13:54.493
Correct on both counts.

13:54.518 --> 13:56.061
Hi baby.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.603
Is the baby-

13:57.628 --> 13:59.317
My son, yes.

13:59.719 --> 14:02.322
I'm Elizabeth Thornton and
this is my nanny, Laura.

14:02.347 --> 14:03.097
Hello.

14:03.122 --> 14:04.620
It's nice to meet you, Laura.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.049
Mrs. Thornton.

14:06.074 --> 14:07.679
I'm Lucas Bouchard.

14:09.113 --> 14:10.929
So what's all this?

14:11.055 --> 14:13.100
Oh, just making a few
improvements to the place.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.181
You can see for yourself
at the grand opening.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.452
I'll try to make it.

14:17.906 --> 14:19.862
Unless you're reading a good book.

14:24.702 --> 14:26.839
Here you go, enjoy.

14:29.237 --> 14:31.298
Your breakfast is getting cold, Henry.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.125
How's that?

14:33.690 --> 14:35.160
What is so interesting?

14:35.232 --> 14:37.479
Oh, I'm just checking the stock market.

14:37.651 --> 14:38.690
You invest?

14:38.715 --> 14:40.018
I dabble.

14:40.043 --> 14:41.369
Actually, I more than dabble.

14:41.394 --> 14:44.157
I've made a tidy little
profit the last few months.

14:44.607 --> 14:46.936
You certainly are restless, aren't you?

14:47.193 --> 14:50.205
Playing the market, making
a bid to buy the saloon.

14:50.527 --> 14:52.738
Well, I enjoy working
for Lee well enough,

14:52.763 --> 14:55.073
it's just I like to keep busy.

14:55.098 --> 14:56.112
If you wanted,

14:56.137 --> 14:58.233
I could invest some money for you.

14:58.579 --> 14:59.925
Oh, no thank you.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.451
I'm not a gambler.

15:01.738 --> 15:04.146
Life is one big gamble, Abigail.

15:04.499 --> 15:06.980
The only question is, do
you want to make a profit?

15:08.713 --> 15:10.109
Hmm.

15:12.032 --> 15:14.239
Everyone's talking about
the new saloon owner.

15:14.264 --> 15:15.495
Yeah.

15:16.062 --> 15:17.230
Look.

15:17.255 --> 15:20.192
He's looking for
bartenders and waitresses.

15:20.296 --> 15:21.719
I could do that.

15:21.859 --> 15:23.427
Why would you want to?

15:23.773 --> 15:24.574
Morning.

15:24.599 --> 15:25.128
Morning.

15:25.162 --> 15:26.380
Uh, hey, sheriff?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.353
What do you know about this new guy?

15:28.976 --> 15:31.145
Not as much as I'd like to.

15:33.537 --> 15:35.773
This kitchen wall is not load-bearing

15:35.806 --> 15:38.352
so we're gonna take it out to
make room for the bigger oven.

15:38.846 --> 15:40.360
Sheriff.

15:40.385 --> 15:42.251
Would you give us a moment?

15:43.089 --> 15:46.278
I wish I could offer you a
drink but we're not open yet.

15:46.303 --> 15:49.306
I just dropped by to see if I
could lend a hand in any way.

15:49.387 --> 15:50.712
To be neighbourly.

15:50.921 --> 15:52.504
Well, that is very kind of you,

15:52.602 --> 15:54.592
but I think everything
is under control.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.494
That's good.

15:56.715 --> 16:00.626
I hear you mentioning
something about a new oven?

16:00.907 --> 16:02.962
I've hired a chef to expand the menu.

16:02.987 --> 16:04.532
I think the good people of Hope Valley

16:04.557 --> 16:06.292
deserve some fine cuisine.

16:06.317 --> 16:07.352
Wouldn't you agree?

16:07.377 --> 16:09.179
There's fine cuisine at Abigail's.

16:09.204 --> 16:10.607
But the town is growing

16:10.632 --> 16:13.807
and surely there's room for
more than one restaurant.

16:15.078 --> 16:16.380
How long you been in the
restaurant business,

16:16.405 --> 16:17.773
Mr. Bouchard?

16:17.798 --> 16:19.877
Actually, I'm fairly new at it.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.265
What did you do before then?

16:22.401 --> 16:24.086
This and that.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.480
This and that, here and there.

16:26.647 --> 16:28.604
Not big on details, are you?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.336
Now and then.

16:31.938 --> 16:33.206
New Orleans.

16:33.231 --> 16:34.910
Is that where you're from?

16:35.152 --> 16:36.911
I've spent time there.

16:38.278 --> 16:40.602
Look, sheriff, I don't
mean to be inhospitable,

16:40.627 --> 16:41.679
but I have a lot of work to do

16:41.704 --> 16:43.495
to get this place ready
for the opening.

16:43.782 --> 16:46.019
Well, I'll be interested to see
what you do with the place.

16:46.319 --> 16:47.916
Assuming I'm invited.

16:48.381 --> 16:49.649
Of course you are.

16:49.674 --> 16:51.709
Come one, come all.

17:06.231 --> 17:07.744
Hi, you two.

17:07.770 --> 17:10.596
Abigail, I am starving.

17:10.621 --> 17:11.693
What are the lunch specials for today?

17:11.718 --> 17:14.015
Lee, where are your manners?

17:14.128 --> 17:16.424
I'm sorry, I-I guess
they're rolling around

17:16.449 --> 17:18.384
in my empty stomach.

17:18.632 --> 17:21.106
Well, today we have brisket
of beef with braised cabbage

17:21.131 --> 17:22.343
and roasted potatoes.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.587
That sounds fantastic.

17:23.612 --> 17:24.839
I'll have two.

17:24.864 --> 17:27.040
Exactly how hungry are you?

17:27.066 --> 17:28.560
One for me, one for you.

17:28.585 --> 17:30.706
You're only eating half
so I get one and a half.

17:30.731 --> 17:31.590
The perks of marriage.

17:32.395 --> 17:33.871
Have a seat.

17:34.828 --> 17:36.040
My love.

17:36.065 --> 17:37.002
There you go.

17:37.027 --> 17:37.764
Thank you.

17:37.789 --> 17:38.602
Here you go.

17:38.627 --> 17:39.759
Thank you so much.

17:39.784 --> 17:41.741
Oh, I see Henry's been here.

17:41.766 --> 17:42.728
How did you know?

17:42.753 --> 17:44.314
He left his mark at the stock pages.

17:44.339 --> 17:45.767
Oh.

17:46.619 --> 17:48.380
Oh, oh, oh, let me help.

17:48.405 --> 17:49.667
Elizabeth.

17:49.692 --> 17:51.985
Alright, alright, alright. Here we go.

17:52.010 --> 17:54.295
What a nice surprise.

17:55.881 --> 17:57.673
The children have been
asking to see the baby

17:57.698 --> 17:59.480
so Laura brought him to school today.

17:59.505 --> 18:00.255
I have an hour with him

18:00.280 --> 18:01.943
while she visits her
friends during lunch.

18:01.968 --> 18:03.946
He's so cute!

18:03.971 --> 18:05.228
He really is perfect.

18:05.253 --> 18:06.048
He is an angel.

18:06.073 --> 18:07.190
Thank you.

18:07.327 --> 18:08.429
Investing?

18:08.454 --> 18:09.536
Oh, this? No, no, no.

18:09.561 --> 18:10.495
That's Henry's.

18:10.569 --> 18:12.472
Henry offered to invest for me.

18:12.497 --> 18:13.599
Oh?

18:13.624 --> 18:15.090
You know, I never thought I'd say this

18:15.115 --> 18:17.327
but I would put money on Henry any day.

18:17.352 --> 18:18.600
In fact, I have put money on him.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.262
Lee!

18:19.287 --> 18:20.355
Shh.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.536
<i>You never told me that.</i>

18:21.561 --> 18:23.815
<i>It's no big deal, it's
just a few dollars a week</i>

18:23.840 --> 18:25.574
and so far it's been yielding
a pretty decent return,

18:25.599 --> 18:26.597
I might add.

18:26.622 --> 18:27.749
Oh, well.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.975
That's different.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.269
There's always a risk, though.

18:30.294 --> 18:31.881
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

18:31.906 --> 18:33.408
Maybe I should take a chance.

18:33.433 --> 18:36.251
There is such a thing
as being too cautious.

18:37.504 --> 18:38.543
I'll do it.

18:38.568 --> 18:39.336
Yeah?

18:40.373 --> 18:41.565
Shh!

18:42.350 --> 18:43.495
Well done, Lee.

18:51.366 --> 18:53.186
Clara Stanton.

18:53.728 --> 18:55.164
Are you related to the mayor?

18:55.189 --> 18:56.771
Abigail is my mother-in-law.

18:56.796 --> 18:58.284
Ah, so you're married.

18:58.824 --> 19:00.157
Widowed.

19:01.229 --> 19:02.738
I'm sorry.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.928
I'm getting married again soon.

19:05.183 --> 19:06.292
Congratulations.

19:06.317 --> 19:07.270
It's not official yet.

19:07.295 --> 19:09.796
First we have to save enough
money to build our house.

19:09.821 --> 19:10.846
Jesse, my boyfriend,

19:10.871 --> 19:12.566
he just bought a piece of
property outside of town-

19:12.591 --> 19:13.726
Ok.

19:13.968 --> 19:14.768
That's-

19:15.452 --> 19:16.546
That's a lot of information.

19:16.571 --> 19:20.041
I have experience waitressing
at Abigail's Cafe.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.727
Oh, I wouldn't want to steal you away.

19:21.752 --> 19:23.072
You wouldn't be.

19:23.117 --> 19:25.314
I work as a seamstress now.

19:25.339 --> 19:26.647
Just during the days.

19:26.672 --> 19:28.522
I'm free to work evenings.

19:29.222 --> 19:30.524
Good to know.

19:34.822 --> 19:35.820
Henry.

19:35.845 --> 19:36.755
Abigail.

19:36.915 --> 19:38.650
Would you still be willing to invest

19:38.675 --> 19:40.292
in the stock market for me?

19:40.806 --> 19:42.098
Oh, of course.

19:42.123 --> 19:43.415
What made you change your mind?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.607
Lee.

19:44.772 --> 19:47.295
He said you've been quite
successful investing for him.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.392
Well, I've been on a
little bit of a run.

19:49.417 --> 19:54.004
Oh, well, I would like to invest $2.

19:54.849 --> 19:56.434
$2.

19:56.514 --> 19:58.101
Alright.

19:58.571 --> 20:00.388
Isn't it enough?

20:00.858 --> 20:02.405
Well, I mean, the more you invest

20:02.430 --> 20:04.292
the more you stand to make.

20:05.991 --> 20:07.493
Oh.

20:07.518 --> 20:09.494
How much would you suggest?

20:09.676 --> 20:12.069
Well, I mean, whatever
you're comfortable with.

20:12.987 --> 20:16.252
Well, I'm looking for a
little guidance here, Henry.

20:16.277 --> 20:21.549
Ok, well um, let's say $5
on Durham Farm Equipment.

20:21.899 --> 20:25.647
Lee and I bought shares last
week and it went up by a third.

20:32.631 --> 20:35.232
In for a penny, in for a pound.

20:38.075 --> 20:39.978
Oh, will you look at that?

20:45.897 --> 20:48.206
<i>The Queen of Hearts.</i>

20:48.231 --> 20:50.909
<i>I guess he's changing
the name of the saloon.</i>

20:50.934 --> 20:52.811
What's in a name?

20:59.981 --> 21:03.227
Hello. Mr. Bouchard, I presume.

21:03.252 --> 21:04.933
And who might you be?

21:04.958 --> 21:05.797
Rosemary Coulter.

21:05.822 --> 21:08.879
Or you probably know
me by my stage name,

21:08.904 --> 21:11.339
Rosemary Leveaux.

21:12.499 --> 21:14.513
I can't say that I do.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.992
Well, you're obviously
not from New York.

21:18.017 --> 21:19.632
Obviously.

21:19.657 --> 21:22.558
Parle vous FranÃ§ais, Monsieur Bouchard?

21:22.583 --> 21:24.935
I'm afraid the only thing
French about me is my name.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.637
Et vous?

21:26.662 --> 21:29.068
Uh petit peu.

21:29.378 --> 21:31.098
How can I help you, Mrs. Coulter?

21:31.409 --> 21:34.013
Well, I just came to welcome
you to Hope Valley.

21:34.038 --> 21:37.112
And to offer you my services.

21:37.137 --> 21:38.355
Your services?

21:38.567 --> 21:40.844
Well, I am an entertainer.

21:40.869 --> 21:42.375
I sing and I play the piano.

21:42.400 --> 21:46.550
There was talks of building
a stage right over there

21:46.575 --> 21:47.758
in the corner, in fact.

21:47.993 --> 21:49.195
You don't say?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.945
I'm a thespian, as well.

21:50.970 --> 21:54.471
Should you ever wish to
produce the occasional play.

21:54.819 --> 21:56.211
A woman of many talents.

21:57.624 --> 21:59.486
So I've been told.

22:00.094 --> 22:02.700
I can't thank you enough
for your very kind offer.

22:03.048 --> 22:06.585
But the entertainment will be
arriving by train shortly.

22:07.305 --> 22:10.868
Oh, uh... what kind of entertainment?

22:10.893 --> 22:12.852
If you'll be my guest
at the grand opening

22:12.986 --> 22:14.892
you can see for yourself.

22:15.254 --> 22:17.055
So I'll... just...

22:17.080 --> 22:21.112
wait patiently like everyone else.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.665
It was such a pleasure meeting you.

22:24.045 --> 22:25.751
Yes.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.213
Likewise.

22:41.885 --> 22:44.054
This is Hope Valley
Central, number please?

22:44.079 --> 22:45.137
<i>Sheriff Avery.</i>

22:45.162 --> 22:47.272
Trying that number now, thank you.

22:58.633 --> 22:59.607
Who is this?

22:59.632 --> 23:00.611
Sheriff, I have a call for you

23:00.636 --> 23:02.674
from the New Orleans police department.

23:03.472 --> 23:04.446
Oh.

23:04.471 --> 23:06.665
Yes, put them through. Thank you.

23:10.494 --> 23:12.863
New Orleans, you're
connected to Sheriff Avery.

23:14.061 --> 23:16.833
Yes, this is Sheriff Avery.

23:17.164 --> 23:19.857
<i>What did you find out
about Lucas Bouchard?</i>

23:28.061 --> 23:29.329
Guess what.

23:29.464 --> 23:30.297
What?

23:30.322 --> 23:31.925
Mr. Bouchard hired me.

23:31.957 --> 23:34.403
You should see what he's
doing with the place.

23:34.888 --> 23:37.104
But Clara, you've already got a job.

23:37.129 --> 23:38.928
I can still work in the
dress shop during the day.

23:38.953 --> 23:41.889
I'll be waitressing
evenings at the saloon.

23:42.262 --> 23:44.394
I don't know, Clara.

23:44.419 --> 23:47.227
You're gonna be so busy, you
won't have any time for us.

23:47.566 --> 23:49.281
Jesse.

23:49.306 --> 23:52.453
The whole reason I'm
doing it is for us.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.521
The sooner we take care
of our money problem

23:54.546 --> 23:57.963
the sooner we can start
our life together.

24:04.292 --> 24:06.217
Alright, I'm gonna let go now.

24:06.630 --> 24:07.865
No.

24:08.218 --> 24:11.456
Timmy, sooner or later you're
gonna have to ride on your own.

24:11.481 --> 24:13.412
But I need you to hold on.

24:14.227 --> 24:15.548
<i>The other children
aren't even watching.</i>

24:15.573 --> 24:17.251
They're too busy playing.

24:17.445 --> 24:19.414
Just try.

24:22.645 --> 24:25.248
You don't need to help anymore, Mrs.
Thornton.

24:25.394 --> 24:27.648
It's not fun, anyways.

24:34.197 --> 24:35.982
<i>Hold for your call, please.</i>

24:36.575 --> 24:38.427
<i>Bonjour, ma chere.</i>

24:50.470 --> 24:52.268
Shh.

24:56.151 --> 24:57.887
How was he this afternoon?

24:57.912 --> 24:59.153
Perfect.

24:59.722 --> 25:00.723
And you?

25:00.748 --> 25:02.566
I finished the chapter.

25:02.591 --> 25:03.926
I'm ready for you to test me.

25:03.951 --> 25:05.854
Well done.

25:11.557 --> 25:12.858
There you go, Faith.

25:12.883 --> 25:14.333
Thank you, Abigail.

25:14.358 --> 25:15.749
It smells wonderful.

25:15.774 --> 25:17.543
Oh, thank you.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.746
Good evening, Mayor Stanton.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.427
Well, if you're going
to be a regular here

25:22.452 --> 25:24.350
you better start calling me Abigail.

25:24.375 --> 25:26.243
Only if you'll call me Lucas.

25:26.268 --> 25:27.865
Have a seat, Lucas.

25:27.890 --> 25:29.954
Thank you.

25:31.626 --> 25:33.175
That looks delicious.

25:33.336 --> 25:34.504
It is.

25:34.529 --> 25:35.830
May I have the same?

25:35.855 --> 25:37.457
Coming right up.

25:39.082 --> 25:40.583
I don't mean to be rude...

25:40.608 --> 25:43.090
Oh, no, please. Go ahead.

25:45.876 --> 25:47.810
Cody, would you mind
taking this plate of food

25:47.835 --> 25:50.419
to the gentleman sitting
next to Miss Carter?

25:53.661 --> 25:55.597
Is that the new saloon owner?

25:55.622 --> 25:57.822
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

25:58.206 --> 26:00.523
Is it true he's a scoundrel?

26:00.830 --> 26:02.789
Cody. Where did you hear that?

26:02.814 --> 26:05.171
Robert's mom heard it from Mrs.
Blakely.

26:05.196 --> 26:07.094
Oh, Florence.

26:07.352 --> 26:09.705
Cody, we have no reason to
believe that Mr. Bouchard

26:09.730 --> 26:12.215
is anything but an honest businessman.

26:12.314 --> 26:14.953
Is that what you think?

26:15.539 --> 26:16.907
Of course.

26:16.932 --> 26:18.031
Now hurry up.

26:18.056 --> 26:20.635
Take his dinner to him
before it gets cold.

26:26.286 --> 26:27.709
Here's your dinner, sir.

26:27.734 --> 26:29.347
Why, thank you.

26:29.372 --> 26:30.782
Aren't you a little young
to be working in a cafe?

26:30.807 --> 26:32.518
My mom's the owner.

26:32.543 --> 26:33.578
Ah.

26:33.603 --> 26:35.134
Another Stanton.

26:35.159 --> 26:36.592
You're quite the clan.

26:36.617 --> 26:39.859
Hang on, what's that
you've got in your ear?

26:40.752 --> 26:42.859
Ah, you must have misplaced this.

26:43.025 --> 26:44.460
Can you teach me?

26:44.485 --> 26:46.145
It's a trade secret, I'm afraid.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.425
But I can show you how to do this one.

26:58.629 --> 26:59.974
That's amazing.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.740
Now you try.

27:05.550 --> 27:07.142
<i>Oh, shoot.</i>

27:08.675 --> 27:10.350
All it takes is practise.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.132
I'm guessing a lot of it.

27:20.064 --> 27:22.589
<i>That's good, that's good...</i>

27:23.841 --> 27:25.462
Where did you learn this?

27:25.487 --> 27:28.001
I just picked it up as a kid.

27:28.026 --> 27:29.864
<i>Didn't have much to do.</i>

27:29.889 --> 27:31.638
<i>Didn't have much to do?</i>

27:32.118 --> 27:33.139
Carson.

27:33.164 --> 27:35.108
Thanks, uh, thanks for dinner, Abigail.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.501
Oh, you're welcome.

27:36.526 --> 27:38.996
I had um... I better get going.

27:39.172 --> 27:40.077
Goodnight.

27:40.102 --> 27:41.405
Goodnight.

27:52.973 --> 27:54.526
Sheriff?

27:54.999 --> 27:56.428
It's Miss Miller, right?

27:56.453 --> 27:57.422
Yes.

27:57.454 --> 27:59.016
Don't you ever take a break?

27:59.041 --> 28:01.863
I'm hoping to start training
more operators soon.

28:11.975 --> 28:14.414
Look, I don't want you
to think I'm a snoop.

28:14.439 --> 28:15.656
Why would I think you're a snoop?

28:15.681 --> 28:17.282
Because I couldn't help
but hear you talking

28:17.307 --> 28:19.898
to the police in New Orleans about Mr.
Bouchard.

28:19.923 --> 28:23.085
I thought the telephone company
had rules against eavesdropping.

28:23.386 --> 28:24.616
We do.

28:24.641 --> 28:26.818
But I'm supposed to listen
to the first ten seconds

28:26.843 --> 28:28.683
to make sure the call went through.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.968
Go on.

28:31.101 --> 28:33.638
If you're investigating Lucas
Bouchard you should know

28:33.663 --> 28:36.233
that he had me place a call
to Cape Fullerton today.

28:36.329 --> 28:39.218
And what did you hear in
the first ten seconds?

28:39.636 --> 28:42.393
He was calling a woman and
they spoke in French.

28:42.418 --> 28:43.933
So you don't know what they said?

28:44.106 --> 28:45.521
Au contraire.

28:45.546 --> 28:47.221
I speak fluent French.

28:47.364 --> 28:51.402
He told her that she was
right, Hope Valley is perfect.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.904
Perfect for what?

28:52.952 --> 28:54.365
He didn't say.

28:54.390 --> 28:57.657
But he told her to send a
package on the morning train.

28:58.376 --> 28:59.932
Do you happen to have the number

28:59.957 --> 29:02.186
that he called in Cape Fullerton?

29:02.719 --> 29:04.366
Mais oui.

29:13.441 --> 29:14.423
<i>Goodnight, mom.</i>

29:14.448 --> 29:15.614
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart.</i>

29:15.639 --> 29:17.256
Sweet dreams.

29:17.979 --> 29:20.656
Oh, Clara, you're working late tonight.

29:20.681 --> 29:22.203
Now that Dotty's opened the
new store in Union City

29:22.228 --> 29:24.427
we have a little more work.

29:24.938 --> 29:27.042
I saved you a plate.

29:27.285 --> 29:28.953
How will you manage without Dotty?

29:28.978 --> 29:31.697
Rosemary's taken on most of
the extra responsibilities.

29:31.722 --> 29:34.802
But I will be working some evenings.

29:34.827 --> 29:36.195
In the dress shop?

29:36.606 --> 29:38.726
No, at the saloon.

29:38.961 --> 29:41.444
It's just until Jesse and
I can save enough money

29:41.469 --> 29:43.109
to get married.

29:44.239 --> 29:45.643
Oh.

29:46.081 --> 29:49.629
You know, I like Mr. Bouchard.

29:50.744 --> 29:52.548
He seems very nice.

29:53.364 --> 29:55.082
He does, doesn't he?

30:03.447 --> 30:04.948
Your call is connected.

30:04.973 --> 30:06.293
<i>Go ahead, please.</i>

30:06.543 --> 30:07.975
Hello?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.762
Is this Cape Fullerton?

30:10.297 --> 30:11.688
<i>Who is this?</i>

30:11.713 --> 30:13.756
This is a friend of Lucas Bouchard's.

30:15.919 --> 30:17.350
Hello?

30:17.375 --> 30:18.685
Sheriff?

30:19.015 --> 30:20.518
She hung up.

30:20.543 --> 30:22.588
<i>Do you want me to place the call again?</i>

30:23.246 --> 30:24.570
No.

30:24.595 --> 30:26.785
Her actions speak louder than words.

30:30.297 --> 30:33.367
Oh, a morning walk was
a brilliant idea.

30:33.392 --> 30:35.292
Well, he loves his Aunty Abigail.

30:35.317 --> 30:37.203
Not as much as I love him.

30:37.761 --> 30:40.113
I never could have imagined
the joy he's given me.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.311
Or the sleepless nights?

30:41.649 --> 30:42.984
Those too.

30:43.182 --> 30:44.898
Does Laura know to come
to the cafe to get him?

30:44.923 --> 30:45.597
Mmmhmm.

30:45.622 --> 30:46.842
If I can part with him.

30:46.867 --> 30:48.510
I know the feeling.

30:48.749 --> 30:51.307
Have a wonderful day, sweet boy.

30:54.194 --> 30:57.395
I met Lucas Bouchard, by the way.

30:58.386 --> 31:00.133
What do you think?

31:00.454 --> 31:02.543
I don't know what to make of him.

31:03.421 --> 31:05.679
By the looks of it, neither do you.

31:09.008 --> 31:10.096
Have a good day.

31:10.121 --> 31:11.317
You too.

31:11.784 --> 31:13.719
Come on, sweet boy.

31:19.102 --> 31:20.168
Hi.

31:20.193 --> 31:23.303
Hey, Clara... I've been thinking

31:23.328 --> 31:27.127
and I don't want you to
take the job at the saloon.

31:27.830 --> 31:29.262
Why not?

31:29.287 --> 31:31.069
You work hard enough
with this job already,

31:31.094 --> 31:33.101
you don't need another.

31:33.913 --> 31:35.651
Tell him you quit.

31:36.647 --> 31:38.880
Do you think it's your
decision to make?

31:39.056 --> 31:42.439
I thought we were in this together.

31:43.697 --> 31:45.389
We are.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.239
I have to get to work.

31:56.645 --> 31:58.107
Mr. Yost.

31:58.132 --> 31:59.583
Can I hire your wagon to
pick up an item arriving

31:59.608 --> 32:01.416
at the train depot this afternoon?

32:01.441 --> 32:02.761
<i>Another one?</i>

32:02.786 --> 32:04.828
This one requires special handling.

32:05.430 --> 32:06.598
Certainly.

32:06.623 --> 32:08.392
Thank you.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.787
Sheriff Avery?

32:20.812 --> 32:24.603
That package we talked about...

32:47.340 --> 32:49.109
<i>Good news, Abigail.</i>

32:49.134 --> 32:50.985
You've made a profit.

32:51.127 --> 32:52.362
I did?

32:52.387 --> 32:53.359
Already?

32:53.384 --> 32:56.462
Well, Durham Farm Equipment
went way up and uh,

32:56.487 --> 32:58.729
well, I decided it was prudent to sell.

32:58.964 --> 33:02.338
So uh, $10.

33:02.363 --> 33:03.509
You uh, doubled your money.

33:03.534 --> 33:07.089
Oh, my gosh Henry, you really are good.

33:07.396 --> 33:09.165
Shouldn't we reinvest it?

33:09.190 --> 33:12.410
Well, a good investor
knows when to quit.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.969
Oh, Timmy.

33:29.994 --> 33:31.562
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

33:31.587 --> 33:32.975
You don't have to stop playing.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.070
Well, I can't play while
someone's watching me.

33:35.095 --> 33:36.221
Especially you.

33:36.246 --> 33:37.413
Why me?

33:37.438 --> 33:39.719
Well, because you're so good at piano.

33:39.744 --> 33:41.919
I remember how beautifully
you played at my wedding.

33:41.944 --> 33:43.723
Well, you're good, too.

33:43.928 --> 33:45.756
I wish I believed that.

33:46.952 --> 33:49.123
Here, I'll play the left hand part

33:49.148 --> 33:50.316
and you'll play the melody.

33:50.341 --> 33:52.159
Alright.

33:53.247 --> 33:54.301
Ready?

33:54.326 --> 33:55.440
Mmmhmm.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.333
See?

34:12.358 --> 34:14.007
You're good.

34:14.033 --> 34:15.884
I guess it just takes practise.

34:16.672 --> 34:19.109
And believing in yourself.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.802
What if I fall in front
of the other kids?

34:25.030 --> 34:27.927
Then you will dust yourself
off and try again.

34:28.263 --> 34:31.451
There are so many wonderful
things to experience.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.822
You just have to be willing
to take a chance on yourself.

34:37.065 --> 34:38.498
Lee!

34:39.050 --> 34:40.043
Hey, Abigail.

34:40.068 --> 34:42.333
I'm on my way to the bank
to deposit my money.

34:42.359 --> 34:43.308
Ok.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.768
Thank you for talking me
into investing with Henry.

34:45.899 --> 34:46.833
Really?

34:46.859 --> 34:48.413
I thought you'd be disappointed.

34:48.438 --> 34:50.174
Oh, why would I be disappointed?

34:50.199 --> 34:53.195
Durham Farm Equipment went way up.

34:53.273 --> 34:54.665
I- I don't know about that.

34:54.690 --> 34:56.391
Henry told me it crashed.

34:56.417 --> 34:57.955
Crashed?

34:57.980 --> 34:59.460
I don't understand.

34:59.485 --> 35:02.045
Something about the farmer's
almanac predicting a dry summer,

35:02.070 --> 35:04.581
so poor harvest, poor sales.

35:04.606 --> 35:05.376
The stock tumbled.

35:05.401 --> 35:06.770
Just please don't tell Rosemary

35:06.795 --> 35:09.117
because I will never
hear the end of that.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.787
Why would Henry tell me
that he doubled my money?

35:15.256 --> 35:17.525
I think you have to
ask Henry about that.

35:18.871 --> 35:20.206
See ya, Abigail.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.592
Thank you, gentlemen.

35:26.617 --> 35:28.501
If you wouldn't mind bringing
it into the kitchen.

35:28.526 --> 35:29.681
Good afternoon.

35:29.706 --> 35:30.915
Sheriff Avery.

35:30.940 --> 35:31.841
Always a pleasure.

35:31.866 --> 35:33.276
What's in the box?

35:33.301 --> 35:35.047
Just supplies for tonight.

35:35.941 --> 35:37.375
Mind if I take a look?

35:37.572 --> 35:39.005
I do, actually.

35:39.030 --> 35:40.589
Why's that?

35:41.039 --> 35:42.608
It's a surprise.

35:43.629 --> 35:45.313
I'd really like to take a look.

35:46.474 --> 35:47.676
Why?

35:47.701 --> 35:49.240
Because I'm the sheriff

35:49.479 --> 35:51.309
and you're a guy that
comes from nowhere,

35:51.334 --> 35:52.358
does nothing in particular,

35:52.383 --> 35:54.938
and yet shows up in my
town like he owns it.

35:54.963 --> 35:56.312
Not the town.

35:57.412 --> 35:59.515
Just the saloon.

36:03.396 --> 36:05.065
Alright.

36:12.248 --> 36:17.186
We are featuring Salmon
Almandine tonight.

36:19.027 --> 36:21.363
Now, if you don't mind,

36:22.118 --> 36:25.822
I need to get the fish back
inside before the ice melts.

36:27.316 --> 36:29.752
I talked to the New Orleans
police department.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.096
They've never heard of you.

36:33.919 --> 36:35.921
New Orleans is big and
memories are short.

36:35.946 --> 36:39.160
A flashy guy like you with money?

36:40.193 --> 36:41.628
Who are you, Bouchard?

36:41.653 --> 36:42.843
What do you want here?

36:43.636 --> 36:45.324
All I want is to open
the Queen of Hearts

36:45.349 --> 36:47.995
with the best party Hope
Valley has ever seen.

36:50.462 --> 36:52.619
Spying on me, sheriff?

36:54.336 --> 36:56.154
It's not very sporting.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.383
<i>Alright.</i>

37:05.090 --> 37:06.325
Very good.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.561
Are you ready?

37:07.688 --> 37:08.705
Yes.

37:08.730 --> 37:10.381
No.

37:12.409 --> 37:13.544
Ok.

37:13.569 --> 37:15.368
Here we go!

37:17.054 --> 37:18.803
Look at me!

37:35.974 --> 37:38.160
That's his idea of entertainment?

37:38.473 --> 37:41.143
You gotta admit, it's
a pretty catchy tune.

37:41.429 --> 37:44.331
I mean, one that you would
play much better, of course.

37:44.356 --> 37:45.437
And look at it this way, Rosemary.

37:45.462 --> 37:47.276
At least now you get
to enjoy the party.

37:47.301 --> 37:47.902
Yeah.

37:47.927 --> 37:50.263
There you go, look on the bright side.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.276
Mr. Coulter, I presume.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.056
I've already met your lovely wife.

37:56.081 --> 37:57.612
Ah, please, call me Lee.

37:57.637 --> 37:59.806
And I love what you've done
with the place so far.

37:59.838 --> 38:00.706
Lucas.

38:00.731 --> 38:01.738
Thank you.

38:01.763 --> 38:03.103
There's still more to be done.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.162
Mrs. Thornton.

38:05.302 --> 38:06.769
Mr. Bouchard.

38:06.794 --> 38:09.088
And where's your husband this evening?

38:11.271 --> 38:12.583
I'm here alone.

38:12.608 --> 38:14.404
Excuse me.

38:14.429 --> 38:18.052
Um, Elizabeth lost her
husband about a year ago.

38:18.612 --> 38:20.463
Ah.

38:22.393 --> 38:24.383
I have a knack for saying
precisely the wrong thing

38:24.408 --> 38:25.713
to your lovely school teacher.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.415
Among other people.

38:28.290 --> 38:29.499
Ok, tiger.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.065
If you'll excuse us.

38:53.972 --> 38:55.940
This is quite the party.

39:04.489 --> 39:06.221
Your French is impeccable.

39:06.246 --> 39:08.320
I presume yours is, as well.

39:09.211 --> 39:11.909
Look, I'm sorry I went to the sheriff.

39:12.203 --> 39:13.461
But you must admit,

39:13.486 --> 39:18.222
you stir up a lot of questions
without providing many answers.

39:18.923 --> 39:22.011
In my experience life isn't about
knowing the right answers.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.603
It's about asking the right questions.

39:29.864 --> 39:32.115
He's a popular guy, don't you think?

39:33.016 --> 39:34.323
How could he not be?

39:34.348 --> 39:36.073
He's doing all this for free.

39:36.339 --> 39:37.407
True.

39:37.432 --> 39:40.198
That would be ridiculous.

39:42.761 --> 39:45.791
You look lovely tonight, by the way.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.994
Thank you.

39:49.916 --> 39:51.175
About what I said-

39:51.200 --> 39:53.058
No, Carson, there's no need-

39:53.083 --> 39:56.975
Faith, I think you're special.

40:00.612 --> 40:02.589
I think you're special, too.

40:03.205 --> 40:05.869
And since I put my foot in my mouth

40:06.011 --> 40:08.731
I think I'll let my
feet do the talking.

40:12.729 --> 40:14.475
Oh, thank you so much.

40:14.500 --> 40:15.643
There you go.

40:15.668 --> 40:17.434
Thank you, sweetheart.

40:19.419 --> 40:22.646
Oh, look.

40:26.359 --> 40:28.194
Mmmhmm.

40:29.322 --> 40:30.793
Come on.

40:31.738 --> 40:33.162
Ladies, if you'll excuse us.

40:33.187 --> 40:33.762
Enjoy.

40:33.787 --> 40:35.442
Shall we?

40:55.784 --> 40:58.848
I hope you understand that
my intentions in Hope Valley

40:58.873 --> 41:00.890
are completely honourable.

41:01.111 --> 41:04.492
When someone has to tell me that
their intentions are honourable

41:04.812 --> 41:06.684
I start thinking the opposite.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.157
Bartender?

41:10.182 --> 41:11.862
Another one for my friend here.

41:12.592 --> 41:13.994
Oh, please.

41:14.019 --> 41:15.472
It's on the house.

41:22.818 --> 41:24.624
If you'll excuse me.

41:43.093 --> 41:45.040
Elizabeth, would you hold
this for one second?

41:45.065 --> 41:45.827
Sure.

41:45.852 --> 41:47.215
Thanks.

41:49.191 --> 41:50.734
Henry?

41:50.759 --> 41:53.621
I believe I owe you this.

41:54.623 --> 41:56.364
What for?

41:56.389 --> 41:59.262
Because I understand that this
came out of your own pocket.

41:59.881 --> 42:01.853
You don't have to do that, Henry.

42:04.113 --> 42:06.083
Tell you what.

42:06.108 --> 42:08.835
You didn't lose all of it.

42:10.648 --> 42:14.357
Henry, I knew the risks when I
asked you to invest for me.

42:14.807 --> 42:16.328
Nobody's perfect.

42:16.353 --> 42:18.132
Don't I know it.

42:36.790 --> 42:38.849
Well, goodnight.

42:38.874 --> 42:41.164
Goodnight, Henry.
