18 years old,

03:27.308 --> 03:29.708

so scared my knees literally
buckle, like, shaking.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.822

11:12.139 --> 11:13.405
if I'm in the middle
of a flare-up,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.740
they can definitely see
that I'm in pain,

11:15.776 --> 11:17.108
and I think that's something
they won't notice

11:17.110 --> 11:18.743
with the alter ego.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.980
Do you think you could, like,
make his tattoos move around?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.915
- How's that?
- That's dope.

He doesn't have
any limitations.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.924
I'm very tired
and very hungry.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.427
I'm hoping that people will see

11:35.429 --> 11:38.196
a side of me that
they might not see otherwise.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.999

11:58.719 --> 12:02.020

What's up?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.223
- Hey. How's it going, grimes?
- Good.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.326
- This is, like,
such a sick look.
- Thanks.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.295
Why do you feel like
you need an alter ego?

12:10.297 --> 12:13.064
And alter ego actually
really helps me a lot in life.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.799
What?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.869
- Yo, do that again, bro.
- What, this?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.972
What? Wow, bro.

12:21.041 --> 12:25.910
I wasn't even expecting
that level of for realness.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.746
So what does
this alter ego give you

12:27.781 --> 12:30.882
that offstage you have
a hard time accessing?

12:30.917 --> 12:34.385
This alter ego actually
can do more than I can.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.754
Yeah, I need this alter ego

12:35.789 --> 12:37.188
more than anything
in the world, honest.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.191
So you ready to let it out?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.827
- I think so.
- Let's do it, man.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.163
Let's go.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.398

14:32.272 --> 14:34.272
Nick:
I noticed something.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.041
Were you tattoos moving
during the performance?

14:37.110 --> 14:40.511
- I believe so.
- Oh!

14:40.513 --> 14:42.146
What?

14:44.117 --> 14:46.951
I think one of the things
we're here to judge

14:46.953 --> 14:49.254
is the synergy
of the alter ego

14:49.256 --> 14:50.555
and the voice,

14:50.590 --> 14:53.258
and you made it
seem effortless.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.026
Thank you.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.964
Your voice was really
beautiful to behold.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.366
Thank you so much.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.301
And I felt every note
you were hitting.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.504
I could listen to your voice
all day long.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.340
Dipper scott,
you really did an amazing job,

15:09.342 --> 15:13.344
but was it enough
to knock queen dynamite
off the diamond?

15:13.346 --> 15:18.516
Remember, the audience
gets to save two alter egos
tonight, too.

15:20.186 --> 15:24.188
- Judges, it's time to vote.
- Alanis?

15:24.190 --> 15:27.025
Queen dynamite,
I loved your performance.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.461
Dipper, your flip and confidence
in the hitting of the note,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.597
your voice is so velvety,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.899
I am going to put dipper
on that diamond.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.138
- Nick?
- Yeah, queen dynamite!

15:40.206 --> 15:43.308
You were awesome, amazing,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.510
and you deserve to be
on that diamond right now.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.346
But, dipper scott,
there was something
that happened

15:48.348 --> 15:52.183
in your performance
that grabbed my heart strings

15:52.218 --> 15:54.018
and yanked them out of my chest.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.221
- Thank you.
- So I'm gonna start to
call you the big dipper,

15:57.223 --> 16:00.358
because you need to be
closer to the stars
on that diamond up there.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.561
So, dipper scott gets my vote.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.298
Grimes, that's two votes
for dipper scott.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.500
I feel like you guys
have both exhibited, like,

16:09.536 --> 16:12.570
the two traits that
I sort of value the most.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.672
I don't know, queen dynamite,
creatively, I dug it.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.475
Dipper, that was really,
really great.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.310
I super love
your moving tattoos.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.579
I feel like that's
kind of what I'm here for,

16:21.614 --> 16:25.216
is, like, what can you be
that your human self can't be?

16:25.251 --> 16:26.451
I don't know. I'm sucked in.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.053
I'm, like,
buying into this entity,

16:29.055 --> 16:30.621
so I'm gonna put dipper
on the diamond.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.326
Rocsi: That's three votes
for dipper scott,

16:35.428 --> 16:36.461
so you know what that means.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.064
Dipper scott, you are
knocking off queen dynamite

16:40.100 --> 16:42.467
from that diamond.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.069
Dipper scott,
please take your place

16:45.071 --> 16:47.472
on the diamond.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.706
If you stay on the diamond,

16:48.742 --> 16:50.475
you'll be through
to the next round,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.310
and the judges
and the audience decide

16:52.379 --> 16:55.113
which one of the remaining four
will go home.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.348
If those first two performances
are any indication,

16:57.384 --> 16:59.150
it's gonna be
one hell of a season.

16:59.152 --> 17:03.054
We've still
got performances by three more
alter egos tonight.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.522
Stick around,
and we'll be right back.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.658
- I mean, he was kinda cute.
- He was.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.659
It feels like you guys hang,

17:08.661 --> 17:10.728
and you're like,
"all right, I'm gonna peace out

17:10.830 --> 17:12.663
and I'm gonna go
to the real world

17:12.665 --> 17:15.466
and you're about to hop
back into virtual land."

17:15.468 --> 17:16.701
you're a part of the same world.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.169
All right,
load the next alter ego

17:18.238 --> 17:19.337
- into the system.
- Copy that.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.447
Rocsi: Welcome back.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.151
It's time to meet our next
alter ego, bernie burns.

17:36.623 --> 17:40.658
- What is happening?
- Oh! I like the suspenders.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.297
- Hi, bernie burns.
- Hello.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.565
How are you feeling right now?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.267
I'm feeling great right now.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.636
What brings you here?

17:51.638 --> 17:54.472
Why was "alter ego"
alluring to you?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.107
In real life,
I'm a very shy person.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.109
I feel like this
will give me an opportunity

17:58.111 --> 18:00.578
to show the world
how I would like to be seen.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.280
Yeah, man.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.753
Because I'm young
and have a baby face,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.221
people don't usually
give me a chance.

18:10.256 --> 18:15.093
I need this alter ego
because I need people
to take me seriously.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.894
I'm erny, I'm an old soul,

18:16.896 --> 18:19.630
I'm 17 years old,
and I'm from new york city.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.099
♪ work it out

18:21.101 --> 18:23.334
I started getting into singing
in ninth grade.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.636
My father used to play
all these records

18:25.705 --> 18:29.107
of dean martin, frank sinatra,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.741
and anyone in the '60s.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.543
I'm very shy kid,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.345
and so I feel that having
this alter ego

18:34.380 --> 18:37.215
would make me very confident
in my abilities.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.449
This is an opportunity to,
you know,

18:38.551 --> 18:40.852
show off how
I really want to be seen.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.289
My alter ego's name
is bernie burns.

18:45.391 --> 18:48.426
Honestly, the process of making
the alter ego was so fun.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.596
I got to pick different
type of clothing,
different shoes.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.665

Real quick, I want to
shout out adam blackstone

21:03.263 --> 21:06.030
and the alter ego band
for that arrangement.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.299
Nick, what did you think?

21:08.334 --> 21:11.235
I kinda feel like bernie
could've been the fifth member
of 98 degrees

21:11.271 --> 21:13.004
with the flames and the...

21:14.907 --> 21:17.508
I think the type of music
that you're doing

21:17.543 --> 21:21.345
lends itself to being
a little bit, like, laid back,

21:21.381 --> 21:23.681
and I felt like you could've
done that a little more.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.417
But all in all, man,
bernie burns,

21:26.519 --> 21:28.719
that performance was en fuego.

21:28.755 --> 21:32.923
Ha-ha! You did it.
You did it.

21:32.959 --> 21:33.824
Okay?

21:36.629 --> 21:40.698
Judges, was that audition
diamond-worthy?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.633
It's time to vote.

21:45.438 --> 21:49.340
Will, was it enough to knock
dipper scott off the diamond

21:49.409 --> 21:51.876
and put him at risk
of going home?

21:51.878 --> 21:54.745
Bernie burns was awesome
and entertaining.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.448
I loved the retro
fused with the futurism.

21:57.517 --> 22:01.819
But I've been moved
by dipper's performance,

22:01.821 --> 22:04.422
so the dipper's gonna stay
on the diamond.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.625
Nick?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.295
Bernie burns, what you did,
it's hard to do,

22:11.331 --> 22:14.598
to be that smooth,
and it's in your whole persona,
and you did great job.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.835
But to me,
dipper ain't dipping.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.708
That's two votes for dipper.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.909
Alanis?

22:24.944 --> 22:27.078
I just really appreciated
your performance,

22:27.113 --> 22:31.082
and I love this style of music
that you performed for us.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.552
Dipper scott,
your voice, your flip,

22:34.554 --> 22:35.953
and your performance
in general

22:35.988 --> 22:37.655
was just really
compelling to me,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.757
so I'm gonna keep dipper
up on that diamond.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.062
That is three votes.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.431
Dipper stays up there.

22:47.433 --> 22:51.836
Bernie burns, I'm so sorry
that your audition wasn't enough
to get you on the diamond,

22:51.871 --> 22:55.539
so now you are in jeopardy
of going home.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.844
The judges and audience
will be sending one alter ego
home at the end of the night.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.014
Only two more
performances tonight.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.384
More "alter ego" coming up next.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.987
Are you ready to show us
what you got tonight?

23:09.989 --> 23:11.689
- Born ready.
- I love it!

23:20.066 --> 23:23.801
This is "alter ego" on fox.
I'm rocsi diaz.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.404
It's time for you at home
to learn all about

23:26.472 --> 23:30.541
our next alter ego,
misty rose.

23:30.643 --> 23:35.146
<i> I want an alter ego because</i>
<i> it allows me to combine</i>

23:35.148 --> 23:37.948
<i> my love for singing</i>
<i> and my love for technology.</i>

23:37.950 --> 23:41.385
I'm a technology girl
through and through,

23:41.454 --> 23:47.158
and I would love to be
the next generation's
digital superstar.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.393
My name is samaera,
I'm 21 years old,

23:49.429 --> 23:51.061
and I'm a singer.

23:53.499 --> 23:56.834
I don't even remember
the first time that I sang

23:56.836 --> 23:58.702
because I practically
came out the womb singing.

23:58.805 --> 24:03.707
It's just where can
I put all of my stress,
my happiness, anything,

24:03.743 --> 24:06.744
I can just put that
into either my singing
or my songwriting.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.415
- ( crew chatter )
- oh, my god.

24:11.451 --> 24:15.853
So this is her? She's sassy.

24:15.855 --> 24:19.023
I wanted misty rose to be
an extension of myself.

24:19.058 --> 24:23.060
Can we try her with blue hair?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.095
My favorite part of this process

24:25.131 --> 24:27.097
was putting on
the motion capture suit.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.666
Like, I'm mad?
Like, I'm mad.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.534
I'm sad? I'm sad. I'm happy?

24:30.603 --> 24:33.537
It translates from me onto her.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.539
This is the future.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.042
I'm totally here for it.
I'm super excited.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.586
Whoo!

24:51.190 --> 24:52.723
Yeah!

24:55.027 --> 24:57.795
- What's up, misty rose?
- Hi, guys.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.097
First question I have
is why are you here?

25:00.166 --> 25:03.267
I'm not ready to be
a human pop star.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.869
I'm a digital pop star.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.671
Love it. Let's go.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.574
Where does your name
misty rose--

25:10.576 --> 25:11.742
where did that conjure from?

25:11.777 --> 25:14.979
The misty part,
that is the name of my cat.

25:14.981 --> 25:18.782
- The rose, that's
'cause I have layers.
- And petals.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.185
Misty are you ready to show us
what you got tonight?

25:21.254 --> 25:23.954
- Born ready.
- I love it!

I loved it.
Alanis, what did you think?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.150
I mean, the vocal performance
was very olympian,

27:00.186 --> 27:04.254
and that chord change
that you just slipped into
so effortlessly?

Good on you, misty rose!

27:26.145 --> 27:29.146
To be asked to do that
on national television

27:29.181 --> 27:31.048
- and just belt that out--
- can you do that, nick?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.082
No!

27:34.220 --> 27:36.153
You're probably
the most distinctly modern

27:36.188 --> 27:38.288
kinda contemporary performance
I think we've seen,

27:38.357 --> 27:41.725
and also the avatar
presentation itself.

27:41.794 --> 27:46.330
- And I love your bangs.
- Girl, you know you're
trying to steal my look.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.268
That was amazing work,

27:51.270 --> 27:56.073
but was it enough
to knock dipper scott
off of the diamond

27:56.075 --> 27:58.275
and put him in jeopardy
of going home?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.378
Judges, it's time
for your decision.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.683
Misty, I can see you
as a digital superstar,

28:05.751 --> 28:07.985
I can see the fans,
I can see the following,

28:07.987 --> 28:09.987
I can see the whole picture.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.691
There was something
about what dipper did

28:13.726 --> 28:17.828
that still-- it pulled
on something in my soul,

28:17.830 --> 28:21.498
so I vote to keep dipper
on the diamond.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.139
- Grimes?
- Yeah, I think misty has so
much commercial potential,

28:29.141 --> 28:32.142
like, someone we would
be down to do something with
or work with.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.978
But, again,
dipper just gave, like,

28:35.014 --> 28:37.448
a really earth-shattering
performance.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.850
So I'm gonna keep dipper
on the diamond.

28:42.288 --> 28:47.458
Two votes for dipper scott
to stay on that diamond. Will?

28:47.493 --> 28:48.692
I'm torn.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.061
Dipper brought a layer

28:51.063 --> 28:53.864
that is invisible
but super powerful,

28:53.866 --> 28:56.667
and how he's done that
is mysterious.

28:56.702 --> 28:59.837
But I also believe
in misty rose,

28:59.872 --> 29:01.171
and there's this thing
about her key change

29:01.207 --> 29:02.205
that was awesome as well.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.174
And so, boom,

29:04.176 --> 29:06.777
I'm with misty on the diamond.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.280
Dipper scott currently
has two votes.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.784
Misty rose, one vote. Alanis?

29:13.819 --> 29:16.053
Misty, I just love your vocal
and the prowess.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.889
There was so much
animating energy

29:18.924 --> 29:20.457
coming through you
and your voice.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.926
I would've liked to have seen
a little bit more

29:22.962 --> 29:25.295
owning that stage and moving
around a tiny bit more.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.198
So for me, I didn't feel

29:28.267 --> 29:31.235
this emotional connection
to the performance.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.304
Dipper, I love your voice,
so, basically,

29:34.340 --> 29:36.340
I'm gonna put dipper scott
up on the diamond.

29:36.342 --> 29:40.344
Yep! Dipper scott stays
on that diamond!

29:41.947 --> 29:47.151
Which means misty rose
could go home tonight.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.789
There's only one more audition
left tonight.

29:51.824 --> 29:55.893
Will they be able to knock
dipper scott off the diamond?

29:55.928 --> 29:58.395
There's kinda no one
been bad this whole time.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.097
Pretty incredible
across the board.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.332
We'll have to be
a little more ruthless.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.510
Welcome back to "alter ego."

30:13.546 --> 30:16.079
are you guys ready
for the last performance?

30:17.183 --> 30:18.882
Ooh, ooh!

30:18.884 --> 30:21.952
All right, I wanna
introduce you guys to seven.

30:26.325 --> 30:30.961
Yeah! Seven!

30:33.232 --> 30:36.033
Yo, your hair is, like,
just wavy with it right now.

30:36.035 --> 30:39.036
Yeah, I got the tentacles
on my head top, you know?

30:39.038 --> 30:43.207
That's dope.
I ain't never seen
no worm hair like that.

30:43.242 --> 30:47.444
Do you feel by having
an alter ego it empowers you?

30:47.479 --> 30:49.913
It allows you to step out here

30:49.915 --> 30:52.316
in a way that you
haven't experienced before?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.318
Absolutely,
and I wanna be able

30:54.353 --> 30:58.021
to stand here and show people
you can be who you are

30:58.090 --> 30:59.923
and being who you are
is just enough.

30:59.959 --> 31:03.460
You don't need to be
anyone else. Yeah.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.196
Growing up,

31:06.232 --> 31:10.067
confidence was not something
I had much of.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.436
It was a little bit, you know,

31:12.438 --> 31:14.271
because I sounded different.

31:14.273 --> 31:18.308
I had a deep voice.
People didn't understand it.

31:18.310 --> 31:22.112
They would misgender
and say that I was a boy.

31:22.147 --> 31:25.982
And it was something
that was so defining for me

31:25.984 --> 31:30.320
as a little girl,
so I need to be here

31:30.356 --> 31:33.323
because I want to see
who I really am

31:33.359 --> 31:35.626
in a space
where I'm not limited

31:35.628 --> 31:38.262
by my every day.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.631
My name kyara tetreault,

31:40.633 --> 31:45.435
I am 28 years old,
and I live in toronto, canada.

31:47.206 --> 31:52.276
In school, I was bullied a lot
for having a deep voice.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.144
People would tease me and say,

31:54.213 --> 31:57.447
"why don't you sound
like the other girls?"

31:57.449 --> 31:59.583
and it really stung

31:59.585 --> 32:01.652
because I didn't know
where I fit in,

32:01.720 --> 32:03.020
because I didn't.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.657
Oh, I look cute!

32:06.692 --> 32:09.026
My alter ego is seven.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.060
I love it.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.462
Seven is confident

32:12.498 --> 32:15.299
and not afraid
to take chances.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.669
I like that seven
doesn't meet expectations.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.539
That is the ultimate
alter ego for me.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.542
Can we take off the skirt?

32:25.577 --> 32:27.444
Yeah, I like that.

It was, like, gorgeous.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.638
Wow. Thank you.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.473
Your voice is super original

34:43.482 --> 34:45.315
Are you nervous right now?

34:45.317 --> 34:47.617
Yeah, like, all the way.

Um...

34:59.398 --> 35:01.231
it means everything.

Nick:
We're celebrating the marriage
of music and technology,

35:35.134 --> 35:38.335
but what you just said, seven,
transcends all of that.

35:38.403 --> 35:42.105
We all deserve
to be who we are,

35:42.107 --> 35:45.108
how we are,
the way we want to be.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.713
Man, I'm just so blessed to be
a part of this moment, honestly.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.885
So the burning question is

35:54.887 --> 35:57.787
was seven's audition enough

35:57.789 --> 35:59.556
to take that spot
on the diamond

35:59.558 --> 36:03.460
guaranteeing them a spot
to the next round?

36:03.495 --> 36:06.663
Or will dipper scott
go on to the next round?

36:06.698 --> 36:08.899
- Judges, it's time to decide.
- Yikes.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.434
( cheering )

36:13.639 --> 36:16.173
I think maybe dipper's
performance was a bit stronger,

36:16.275 --> 36:20.310
but seven, to me, captured
something truly unique.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.513
So I'm gonna put seven
on the diamond,

36:23.549 --> 36:27.384
but I'll make fan pages
for both of you.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.957
- Thank you.
- Alanis?

36:33.992 --> 36:36.927
Dipper, your performance
and the voice were
off the charts for me,

36:36.929 --> 36:38.228
so I'm gonna
keep dipper up there.

36:41.867 --> 36:45.468
Seven, your low register
you probably felt was odd.

36:45.504 --> 36:48.138
That oddity is freaking awesome.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.508
Thank you.

36:53.278 --> 36:57.347
And my decision does not reflect
my belief your talent,

36:57.349 --> 36:59.749
but I'm gonna keep dipper
on the diamond.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.788
This is a big decision
right now, nick.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.791
One more vote for dipper

37:07.859 --> 37:09.025
and that keeps him
on the diamond.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.760
Another vote for seven,

37:10.862 --> 37:12.929
and we go into a tiebreaker
with the audience.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.366
Whew!

37:17.836 --> 37:20.904
I've been moved and inspired

37:20.906 --> 37:22.672
by your performances tonight.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.507
To me, that's what
this is all about.

37:24.509 --> 37:27.711
It's an opportunity
to be who we are as artists

37:27.746 --> 37:30.347
and share that artistry
with the world,

37:30.382 --> 37:32.649
and you guys have both
done that tonight.

37:32.651 --> 37:36.686
There's still something
that dipper did

37:36.755 --> 37:39.889
that touched something in me
that I can't let go of,

37:39.958 --> 37:45.262
and so I will also vote
to keep dipper on that diamond.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.833
Rocsi:
Unfortunately, seven,

37:49.835 --> 37:53.670
your audition wasn't enough
to get that spot on the diamond,

37:53.705 --> 37:57.240
which means you are
in jeopardy of elimination.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.510
The judges kept dipper scott
on the diamond,

38:00.512 --> 38:02.879
which means he will
automatically move on

38:02.948 --> 38:05.415
to the head-to-head round.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.418
Congratulations, dipper scott.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.424
And now,
our in-studio audience

38:14.459 --> 38:17.427
will vote
their favorite alter ego.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.497
Their top two picks will
move on to the head-to-heads,

38:20.565 --> 38:22.832
and it'll be up
to the judges to decide

38:22.901 --> 38:26.369
which one of the remaining two
singers stays in the competition

38:26.438 --> 38:29.939
and advances to the next round
and which one goes home.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.675
Find out who comes out on top

38:31.743 --> 38:34.944
and who will reveal their
true identity to the judges

38:34.946 --> 38:36.780
and head home, after this.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.052
He brought seven and the depth
to a totally different level.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.787
She's a woman.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.789
- No.
- But I love that
we can't tell.

38:50.462 --> 38:54.297
- Okay, so come on back.
- Here we go. 3, 2...

38:59.004 --> 39:01.538
- Yeah!
- This is "alter ego,"

39:01.540 --> 39:03.973
and I am your host rocsi diaz.

39:03.975 --> 39:07.911
This has been
such a huge night.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.013
Dipper scott has gone through
to the next round,

39:10.048 --> 39:12.449
and four contestants remain.

39:12.484 --> 39:15.652
Our in-studio audience votes
have been counted,

39:15.687 --> 39:19.522
and now I can reveal
that the two alter egos

39:19.591 --> 39:21.858
advancing to
the next round are...

39:24.830 --> 39:26.496
Queen dynamite.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.998
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

39:29.067 --> 39:31.501
- Yeah!
- Rocsi: And...

39:32.938 --> 39:34.037
Seven!

39:39.144 --> 39:41.611
Congratulations to you both.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.781
We'll see you
at the head-to-heads.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.784
Unfortunately,
that means bernie burns

39:47.786 --> 39:51.054
and misty rose
are in the bottom two.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.889
It's in your hands, judges.

39:52.991 --> 39:56.393
- Who stays and who goes home?
- Oh, boy.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.062
- Is she is the best one?
- Will.I.Am: That was awesome.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.464
- Everybody's tone
is just, like--
- so great.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.666
Nick: It's so much easier when
someone has a bad performance

40:03.668 --> 40:04.868
- and it just sticks out.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.471
Grimes: This is why
I loved bernie burns.

40:08.507 --> 40:09.873
'cause you get these
character singers--

40:09.941 --> 40:13.510
yeah, it's not always about
hitting the note for me.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.512
I mean, it's nice when we do.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.614
- I'm really torn.
- Will.I.Am: That's deep.

40:18.884 --> 40:19.916
Oy.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.684
Rocsi: Judges,
you have to decide

40:21.720 --> 40:25.021
which one of these alter egos
gets to stay in the competition

40:25.056 --> 40:27.023
and which one
will have to go home tonight

40:27.058 --> 40:31.628
and reveal their true identity
to you in the studio audience.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.029
What is your decision?

40:33.031 --> 40:34.831
Will.I.Am:
At the end of the day,

40:34.833 --> 40:36.800
we're looking for a star.

40:36.835 --> 40:41.971
Bernie burns,
I like the retro futurism.

40:41.973 --> 40:46.075
Misty rose, you have
a universal pop appeal.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.979
The look of your alter ego
is international.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.884
The decision that
the other judges and I made

40:54.920 --> 40:58.555
is to put misty through
to the next round.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.557
<i> ♪ I need you all night </i>

41:00.559 --> 41:05.462
congratulations, misty rose.
That is three votes.

41:05.464 --> 41:09.699
We will see you
at the head-to-head round.

41:12.037 --> 41:16.105
I'm so sad to say this,
bernie burns,

41:16.107 --> 41:20.777
but we're gonna have to say
goodbye to you tonight.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.946
You were absolutely awesome.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.415
But before you go,

41:25.484 --> 41:27.884
we'd love for you to perform
one last time

41:27.886 --> 41:29.719
and for you to reveal
your identity.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.921

Oh, my goodness.

42:53.672 --> 42:54.904
That was sick!

42:54.973 --> 43:00.977
Judges, this is erny,
aka bernie burns.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.746
- Erny!
- What's up, erny?

43:03.782 --> 43:06.983
- Hey.
- What do you do for a living
outside this alter ego?

43:06.985 --> 43:09.652
- I'm 17. I, uh--
- you're 17?

43:09.688 --> 43:11.220
- Erny: Yeah.
- No way!

43:11.256 --> 43:14.891
- What?
- Beautiful, man.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.192
I can't wipe
the smile off my face.

43:16.227 --> 43:19.696
I mean, it's so much fun
to watch you do

43:19.731 --> 43:20.797
what you clearly love to do.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.198
And I think
everyone in this room

43:22.233 --> 43:26.135
loved watching you do it.

43:26.204 --> 43:29.906
- Erny,
how did that feel for you?
- Very emotional experience.

43:29.975 --> 43:34.110
I'm a very shy person,
and so being bernie burns,

43:34.145 --> 43:36.813
I felt that he was
everything I wanted to be.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.114
Which was what?

43:38.149 --> 43:40.817
Well, he was cool,

43:40.885 --> 43:42.719
he was, you know, handsome.

43:42.754 --> 43:45.188
- You're handsome.
- And you're cool.

43:45.223 --> 43:46.589
You're cool
and handsome, brother.

43:46.591 --> 43:50.893
- Thank you.
- Lots of love to you, erny.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.029
Thank you so much.
You did it.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.831
Crowd:
Erny, erny, erny, erny!

43:54.866 --> 43:57.300
Join us tomorrow as five
new alter egos hit the stage

43:57.302 --> 44:00.003
for the second night
of our two night premiere

44:00.005 --> 44:02.739
after "the masked singer."
good night.
