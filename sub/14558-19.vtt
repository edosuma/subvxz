WEBVTT

00:13.013 --> 00:15.316
WOMAN (over radio):
Hey, Phil, what's your 20?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.584
Blackwell Trail.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.685
I'm going to head
on over to the north side,

00:17.718 --> 00:19.453
check out the campgrounds.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.455
You coming back to the station
for dinner break?

00:21.489 --> 00:22.756
That depends. You cooking?

00:22.790 --> 00:25.526
See you later, wise guy.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.262
(loud roar of jet engine)
Son of a...

00:28.296 --> 00:29.663
(branches rustling)

00:32.166 --> 00:34.468
(loud, rumbling explosion)

00:34.502 --> 00:36.404
WOMAN: Phil, what's that? Are
you all right?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.239
Did you see it?

00:39.607 --> 00:41.542
PHIL:
Plane crash. Went right over me.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.544
Where did it go down exactly?

00:43.577 --> 00:44.812
Just past the third switchback.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.348
I'm almost there.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.416
Emergency crews
are on their way,

00:48.449 --> 00:49.717
but if you're that far out...

00:49.750 --> 00:50.818
Holy...!

00:58.359 --> 01:01.195
WOMAN:
Phil?

01:01.229 --> 01:02.730
Send everyone.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.632
This is bad.

01:04.665 --> 01:08.102
(shouting):
Is there anyone alive?!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.412
Can anyone hear me?!

01:18.446 --> 01:19.680
(clicking)

01:19.713 --> 01:22.483
Hello?

01:22.516 --> 01:24.652
(gunshot)

01:24.685 --> 01:27.188
CHARLIE: Right in the middle of
my lecture.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.822
ALAN: Charlie, I'm as
embarrassed as you are.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.291
You were snoring...

01:30.324 --> 01:33.261
Charlie, did, uh, we
forget to lock the door?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.095
What?

01:38.566 --> 01:41.135
Wow!

01:41.169 --> 01:42.236
Wait, wait.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.172
They could still be here.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.108
Here.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.484
ALAN: They got the DVD player

01:56.517 --> 01:57.785
and my laptop.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.188
I've been living
in this neighborhood 30 years.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.423
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.159
Hey, they, uh... they stole
the case of Bavarian beer.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.894
Uh, they stole the blender.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.562
Why would anyone
want a blender?

02:08.596 --> 02:09.763
I'm calling Donny.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.900
Hey, Donny, someone broke
into the house.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.403
No, no, no, we're fine.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.271
I-I think they
were after only...

02:17.305 --> 02:19.240
What? Yeah, sure.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.742
All right. I'll let you
know what the police say.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.943
Yeah. Bye.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.213
- Dad, is he coming or not?
- No, he can't.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.748
He's, uh, he's got a case--
uh, some airplane crash.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.451
Did he say where?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.620
Yeah, a small jet
in the Angeles Forest.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.823
Where are you going?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.791
I'm just going
to go grab my stuff,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.627
because it's a plane crash.
I mean, that's...

02:39.660 --> 02:41.195
that's an amazingly
complex dynamics problem.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.663
They're probably going
to need my help.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.266
If I leave now, I should
get there by dawn.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
Call the police.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.836
Two sons who solve crimes.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.438
Neither one cares.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.240
COLBY: So, I talked to David,

02:52.273 --> 02:53.341
he'll coordinate
from the office,

02:53.374 --> 02:56.344
but I haven't been able
to get a hold of Megan yet.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.212
ALAN: Yeah, she's on detachment
to the DOJ.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.281
Don't ask me, I can't
say any more than that.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.750
I get it-- you tell me,
she'll have to kill me, huh?

03:04.985 --> 03:07.855
This guy up here is a forest
ranger named Phil Hadwin.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.559
NTSB said he was the
first one on the scene.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.495
Said he never
drew his weapon,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.564
so whoever shot him
must have surprised him.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.399
All right.
So, who's that?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.801
We don't know,
but nobody on board.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.371
Said all the passengers
on board were accounted for.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.374
(garbled radio transmission)

03:26.407 --> 03:27.375
- Bob?
- Yeah.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.577
Don Eppes. Bob Tombrello.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.745
- Hey, Don. Good to have you.
- Hey, Bob. How's it going?

03:31.779 --> 03:32.613
What have you got here?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.914
We got a corporate
jet carrying five,

03:33.947 --> 03:36.350
including the pilot
and the copilot.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.885
They're all dead.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.689
Seat belts don't do you
much good at 270 miles an hour.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.724
COLBY: These passengers were all
officers

03:43.757 --> 03:46.860
of a company called AeroNomics;
high-tech defense contractor.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.429
What brought it down?

03:48.462 --> 03:49.830
Little too
soon to tell.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.998
We just started
the investigation.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.065
COLBY:
So it's possible

03:52.099 --> 03:54.668
it was knocked out of the sky--
a bomb, a rocket?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.804
CHARLIE:
I don't think so.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.506
Yeah, you see,

03:58.539 --> 04:00.641
this debris field is
too compact, it's too directed.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.744
So I'm pretty sure the plane was
intact when it hit the ground.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.012
Charlie,
what are you doing here?

04:05.045 --> 04:07.348
Classical mechanics
mixed with a dash

04:07.381 --> 04:09.317
of Ito-Stratonovich
Drift Integrals.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.518
I mean, that's
a perfect recipe

04:10.551 --> 04:12.320
for putting a crashed plane
back together.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.621
Yeah? Well, slow down. I mean,

04:13.654 --> 04:14.688
we're just getting
going here.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.290
We don't even know
what we've got.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.358
Well, where there's one,
Eppes, there's always two.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.426
Agent Edgerton.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.394
Anybody looking for this?

04:20.428 --> 04:21.429
That's the black box.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.696
How'd you
find that?

04:22.730 --> 04:23.931
How I find anything.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.299
TOMBRELLO: Gentlemen, take it

04:25.333 --> 04:26.667
and run diagnostics
on this, please.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.736
Excuse me. Do you mind if I tag
along?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.304
- I'm Professor Charles Eppes.
- Yeah, Charles.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.373
Ian, didn't know
you were around.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.741
I wasn't
till they found

04:33.774 --> 04:34.675
a dead forest ranger.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.810
Done a lot of tracking
on this mountain.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.347
I've already scoured a 100-yard
perimeter, looking for tracks,

04:39.380 --> 04:41.382
signs of encampment.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.717
Figure, what, maybe the guy who
shot him was living in the area,

04:43.751 --> 04:45.653
and drawn by the crash?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.021
How have you been, Eppes?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.557
I haven't talked to you since

04:49.590 --> 04:50.791
the Crystal
Hoyle caper.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.560
I'm all right, Ian.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.363
TOMBRELLO:
88 variables.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.631
Cruising speed, plane mass,

04:57.665 --> 04:59.867
inclination,
fuel burn,

04:59.900 --> 05:03.337
even the cockpit voice
recorder-- black box

05:03.371 --> 05:06.039
records everything.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.941
That damage is worse
than I thought.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.710
I'll have to send this back
to our lab

05:09.743 --> 05:11.111
in D.C. to recover the data.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.514
The California Institute
of Science lab is a lot closer.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.348
We've got the equipment there.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.315
We've certainly got
the know-how.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.551
Beats waiting around
five days for results.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.919
That's what I'm saying.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.989
So if the ranger was
the first one on the scene,

05:22.022 --> 05:25.125
and he arrived just minutes
after the crash...

05:25.158 --> 05:28.095
Yeah, but how
do we know he was first?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.597
What, you mean
the shooter?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.499
No. I searched all
over these woods.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.701
There weren't any
trails or boot prints.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.636
Well, guys,

05:35.669 --> 05:37.771
I mean, a dead ranger
and a crashed plane--

05:37.805 --> 05:39.673
it doesn't feel
like a coincidence to me.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.075
Well, if the shooter is tied
directly to the plane crash,

05:42.109 --> 05:43.911
he had to be here
ahead of time.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.414
Just waiting for the plane
to fall out of the sky?

05:54.855 --> 05:55.756
MILLIE:
Wow.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.959
Who knew a black box
isn't really black?

05:58.992 --> 06:02.162
Yeah. For it to be damaged
at all is so rare.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.798
Oh, they must have been flying
awfully fast.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.834
Probably hit the ground
full-force. Yeah, well,

06:06.867 --> 06:08.736
hard enough to damage
the stacked memory boards.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.937
Hey, Amita, um,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.406
what was that...
that DVD you lent me?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.141
- Oh, The Bicycle Thief.
- The Bicycle Thief.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.876
- Yeah. It was great, right?
- Yeah.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.412
Uh, I won't be returning it.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.813
Oh, you liked it that much?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.482
It was stolen
inside

06:21.515 --> 06:22.182
my DVD player,

06:22.215 --> 06:25.453
along with a
vase, a blender,

06:25.486 --> 06:26.887
my Dad's laptop.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.088
Wait. Someone broke
into your house?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.590
Yeah, last night.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.390
Police think

06:30.424 --> 06:32.660
it's probably just
a bunch of kids.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.568
(indistinct conversations)

06:42.603 --> 06:45.038
If there is anything

06:45.072 --> 06:47.074
our department can do to help...

06:47.107 --> 06:48.609
(sighs)

06:48.642 --> 06:51.545
Yeah, um, you and Ranger
Hadwin were the only rangers

06:51.579 --> 06:52.846
stationed up here,
is that right?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.948
This time of year,
the ridge is quiet.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.817
It was just the two of us.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.852
Did either of you encounter
anyone up here?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.154
Maybe anyone camping out,
or living off the land?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.591
Summers, we see campers.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.528
(voice breaking):
But, um, now...

07:09.663 --> 07:12.099
Phil and I had
the whole mountain to ourselves.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.601
(crying)

07:13.634 --> 07:14.968
I'm sorry.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.504
No, it's okay.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.507
I understand
you two were probably close.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.541
(sniffles)

07:20.574 --> 07:22.976
Phil was my... husband.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.247
(sniffles)

07:27.280 --> 07:28.882
I'm so sorry.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.485
I-I had no idea.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.554
I didn't want it
to make a difference.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.189
I want to help you find
whoever did this to him.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.192
I need this.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.262
I need to be doing something
to keep my mind busy.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.597
Yeah.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.865
MAN:
Hold on, gentlemen.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.534
This is a crime scene.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.969
This whole area is off
limits to... Sir!

07:49.002 --> 07:50.003
I'm really sorry.

07:50.037 --> 07:53.541
I'll be right back, okay?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.709
Hey, guys, I'm going to
need to see some credentials.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.010
You don't understand.
That's my plane.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.779
Okay, what do you mean,
that's your plane?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.848
My name is Aaron Helm.
I'm CEO of AeroNomics.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.850
Those were my people
in that crash.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.619
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but we
still can't have you back here.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.888
I've got five families
who are looking for answers.

08:07.921 --> 08:12.593
All of the passenger bodies
have been moved to the L.A.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.994
Coroner's Office,

08:14.027 --> 08:16.764
so the families will be
receiving a call shortly.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.699
My God, if this was my fault...

08:18.732 --> 08:19.232
John, we don't
know that yet.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.568
And you are?

08:20.601 --> 08:23.604
John Wellner,
the plane's mechanic.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.905
We're a very small company.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.207
The more I can tell
my people now,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.810
the easier it's going
to be for all of us.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.912
Cause of the crash
is yet to be determined.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.983
So please go back
and be with the families.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.619
When we have any real
information, we'll contact you.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.757
CHARLIE:
All right, there you go.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.659
The input buses are connected.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.493
TOMBRELLO:
Gentlemen,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.028
the digital
flight data recorder,

08:48.061 --> 08:49.296
also known as the black box.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.666
This will allow us to recreate
the last moments of the flight--

08:52.700 --> 08:54.802
altitude, air pressure,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.704
flap movement, pitch,
you name it.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.006
As you can see,
right after wheels-up,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.174
the pilot hands over control
of the aircraft

09:01.208 --> 09:03.677
to the Flight Management
Computer.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.678
And that's normal, right?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.246
Sure. I mean,
the fact is,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.616
with the help of the plane's
Inertial Reference System,

09:08.649 --> 09:09.983
the FMC can basically fly

09:10.017 --> 09:12.986
and land a plane within
a millimeter of accuracy.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.090
CHARLIE: Okay, coming through
10,000 feet.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.628
TOMBRELLO:
That's where

09:20.661 --> 09:21.729
the plane hits
the mountain.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.063
But didn't the impact happen

09:23.096 --> 09:24.965
at around 6,000 feet?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.835
Yes, it did,
and the altimeter

09:27.868 --> 09:30.237
is just north of 10,000.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.438
So, it's off by 4,000 feet.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.874
All right, so there's something
wrong with the altimeter.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.776
It's unlikely. Every plane's
got triple back-up.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.846
If one system fails,
a second checks in.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.749
Well, so, the Inertial Reference
System was wrong times three?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.617
How do you look out a window

09:43.651 --> 09:45.318
and not see a mountain
coming at you?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.655
No moon, black sky.
We had the exact situation

09:47.688 --> 09:51.058
a few years back
with Air New Zealand flight 901.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.359
Now, because of
that accident,

09:52.392 --> 09:53.927
mistakes like this
are almost impossible.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.996
So what-- sabotage?

09:56.029 --> 09:58.365
I can't tell you without the
Flight Management Computer.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.668
Yeah, but isn't that
what this is?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.302
No. This is the black box.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.337
It just records
and stores data.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.006
Right, the Flight
Management Computer

10:06.039 --> 10:07.775
is-is the aircraft's
brain.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.077
Which, unfortunately, we
haven't been able to find yet.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.681
Wow. Well, uh, with
the data from the black box,

10:13.714 --> 10:16.784
along with a topographical map
of the impact site,

10:16.817 --> 10:19.753
what I can do is,
calculate a highly-precise,

10:19.787 --> 10:22.289
predictive debris field pattern.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.125
That will help us find the
Flight Management Computer.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.728
CHARLIE:
With some math

10:27.761 --> 10:29.296
and a little persistence,

10:29.329 --> 10:30.998
the Flight
Management Computer

10:31.031 --> 10:32.833
shouldn't be
too hard to locate.

10:32.866 --> 10:33.801
Thank God

10:33.834 --> 10:36.804
for the geometry of
predictive trajectories.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.172
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.875
What's the measurement?

10:41.909 --> 10:44.211
45 feet, two inches.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.979
Oh, uh...

10:46.013 --> 10:48.315
Have you heard anything else
about the burglary?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.984
You know what, to be honest,
I'm so caught up with this...

10:51.018 --> 10:52.753
- My Dad's dealing with it.
- No, I know.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.456
But, um... is he okay?

10:56.489 --> 10:59.727
Uh, I know how he is
about that house.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.795
You know,
when I was an undergrad,

11:01.829 --> 11:04.297
I never locked my dorm room.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.800
Until someone came in one day

11:06.834 --> 11:10.203
and stole a Fossil watch
right off my desk.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.205
Changed my thinking.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.907
I always lock my
door, you know?

11:13.941 --> 11:16.009
Sometimes I double and sometimes
I even triple check it.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.878
I noticed that, that cute
little thing you do

11:17.911 --> 11:19.747
where you unlock the bolt,
then relock the bolt.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.781
What's the measurement?

11:20.814 --> 11:24.051
63 feet, three inches.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.986
No, Charlie,
the point is,

11:26.019 --> 11:28.822
is that having
someone come in

11:28.856 --> 11:31.725
and rob your house
can be a very emotional thing.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.361
You know, maybe this is
a bigger deal than you realize.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
It is bigger.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.402
Are we not talking
about the same thing anymore?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.404
We've planted eight flags.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.774
Every one of them,
the trajectories were dead on,

11:46.807 --> 11:48.275
the distances were off.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.011
You allowed room for some slosh
in your calculations, right?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.145
Yeah, but this
isn't slosh.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.180
I mean, with slosh...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.015
the distances would be off
in both directions-

11:55.048 --> 11:55.883
some short, some long.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.451
Our predictions,
the distances are short,

11:58.485 --> 12:02.489
every one by... geez,
by almost 15%.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.424
Let me see.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.762
It's like everything's out
of scale.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.497
It's amplified.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.500
Hold this.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.871
Factoring in
for this...

12:17.905 --> 12:21.775
new nontrivial amplification
and combining that

12:21.809 --> 12:24.477
with trajectories
that we've already mapped out,

12:24.511 --> 12:26.847
we should be able to find...

12:31.919 --> 12:33.821
the FMC!

12:39.226 --> 12:41.194
EDGERTON:
Take a look at this.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.930
These tire marks

12:42.963 --> 12:44.932
started under some brush.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.201
The, uh, axle width
and tread block

12:48.235 --> 12:50.470
point to a Ford F-250 pickup.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.139
Doesn't match with any
of the emergency vehicles

12:52.172 --> 12:53.440
in the area.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.275
You think this might be
the killer's truck.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.376
Yeah.
Look at this.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.211
What is that, oil?
Yeah.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.847
It's concentrated here.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.949
He was sitting there
for a while.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.584
Waiting for the
plane to crash.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.854
Sick as it is, I can see
crashing a plane,

13:06.887 --> 13:10.190
but why would you want to be
there when it comes down?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.558
So...

13:11.591 --> 13:15.295
we found the plane's
Flight Management Computer.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.064
- That's great, Charlie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't

13:17.097 --> 13:18.231
where it was
supposed to be.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.867
Yeah, we found it
by adjusting the size

13:19.900 --> 13:21.869
- of the debris field.
- Sounds like a happy ending.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.136
No, it's a problem.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.371
Here, I'll show you.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.578
You shouldn't come
between a man and his fiber.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.081
All right, so that's
the debris field.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.415
Now, this looks like

13:35.448 --> 13:37.050
it's just sort of
a random mess,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.185
but it's not.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.353
See, a debris field
size and shape

13:40.387 --> 13:42.189
is actually governed
by variables like speed,

13:42.222 --> 13:43.991
mass, angle
of incidence,

13:44.024 --> 13:45.192
ground topography.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.328
Now, let's say
this muffin had

13:48.361 --> 13:50.163
walnuts in it, well, then

13:50.197 --> 13:52.032
the mess would've
been much larger.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.433
See, because walnuts
weigh more.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.002
And extra weight means
more mass,

13:55.035 --> 13:58.038
which translates into
greater momentum.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.942
Similarly, what we
have outside is...

14:01.975 --> 14:04.978
...a debris field that's,
that's much

14:05.012 --> 14:07.580
larger than
it should be.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.916
Larger, because the plane
was heavier

14:08.949 --> 14:10.283
than the manifest
indicated.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.185
Right about 1000 pounds heavier.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.087
Well, what exactly was
this weight?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.891
It has to be what
the killer was waiting for.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.326
Just want to know
what's so valuable

14:19.359 --> 14:21.128
that someone's willing
to crash a plane

14:21.161 --> 14:24.031
and kill six people
in order to get it.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.537
Okay, I've looked over
the debris field map twice.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.604
Every major component

14:31.638 --> 14:33.673
of the aircraft
is accounted for.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.442
So, if Professor Eppes'
calculations are right,

14:35.475 --> 14:38.078
we are definitely missing
1000 pounds of cargo.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.513
Trust me, Professor Eppes'
calculations are right.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.648
Those tire marks
I found...

14:41.681 --> 14:44.017
there were two sets--

14:44.051 --> 14:45.685
one driving up to the crash,

14:45.718 --> 14:48.555
the other one leaving.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.456
The ones leaving were deeper.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.557
Can somebody do this?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.491
Can somebody know
exactly

14:51.524 --> 14:53.260
where this plane was going
to come down?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.962
This peak is aligned

14:54.995 --> 14:56.363
with the San Bernardino
Regional Airport

14:56.396 --> 14:58.165
takeoff path.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.101
We get as many as 15 planes
an hour overhead.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.569
So if they messed
with the altimeter,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.537
made sure the plane was
4,000 feet low...

15:04.571 --> 15:06.073
It would crash right here.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.008
Give or take a mile.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.577
DAVID: What was on that plane,
Mr. Helm?

15:10.610 --> 15:14.247
Apparently there was a thousand
pounds of undeclared cargo.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.583
Our scramjet prototype.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.385
Which is?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.487
Which is a new breed
of missile propulsion.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.290
It's efficient,
it's clean, it's fast.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.724
We can have
some of my technicians

15:24.757 --> 15:27.194
identify its parts
among the wreckage.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.395
NTSB's already
inventoried

15:28.428 --> 15:30.363
the major debris
from the wreckage.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.731
They didn't find anything
like that.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.466
- What are you saying?
- It's gone.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.268
This thing is missing.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.469
Who do you
think might

15:36.503 --> 15:37.637
- be after it?
- Could be

15:37.670 --> 15:39.472
any one and a half-dozen
propulsion labs.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.141
We're all racing
to develop

15:41.174 --> 15:43.043
a viable scramjet prototype.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.477
First ones in are going
to get billions

15:44.511 --> 15:46.113
in government contracts.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.347
That's why it wasn't
on the manifest.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.416
We were flying it out
to Santa Fe for testing.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.084
We didn't want
anyone to know

15:51.118 --> 15:52.385
how far along
we were.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.321
How about the mechanic
for the plane?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.622
Who's he?
Where's he at?

15:55.655 --> 15:56.723
- John Wellner?
- Yeah.

15:56.756 --> 15:57.590
He isn't here.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.693
After we were out
at the crash site,

16:00.727 --> 16:04.397
saw all our friends dead,
he was a basket case.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.133
I sent him home.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.204
So, the State Department said

16:11.238 --> 16:12.305
because the scramjet's
a prototype,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.641
they're not worried about it
as an imminent threat.

16:14.674 --> 16:18.045
The FAA analyzed the plane's
Flight Management Computer.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.213
It was reprogrammed
two days ago.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.615
Now, you need a lot
of technical knowledge

16:22.649 --> 16:24.051
just to get at the FMC.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.218
It sits inside

16:25.252 --> 16:27.154
an obscure panel

16:27.187 --> 16:28.121
underneath
the nose cone.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.789
Something an airplane
mechanic would know.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.626
Colby and Edgerton just called
me from Wellner's apartment.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.295
He never made it back home.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.164
And Helm was saying
that they're worried

16:37.197 --> 16:39.432
that someone's going to rip off
the designs for the scramjet.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.333
So no one supposedly

16:40.367 --> 16:42.269
outside the company
knew the thing was

16:42.302 --> 16:43.403
on the plane.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.471
Which means, pretty much,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.474
whoever wanted it they had
to have an inside man.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.742
Look at this, David.
That's a pretty narrow space.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.778
So if somebody wanted
to mess with that FMC,

16:51.811 --> 16:53.680
it'd be pretty hard
not to leave some prints.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.086
Oh, hey.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.154
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.622
Hey, uh...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.192
look, I-I just
want, um...

17:05.225 --> 17:07.127
I'm sorry about running out
on you last night.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.128
That was...

17:08.161 --> 17:10.663
Well, you did say it was
about an airplane crash.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.665
Yeah, some pretty interesting...

17:12.699 --> 17:15.335
debris field dynamics
emerged, actually.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.737
You know what really bugs me?

17:17.770 --> 17:20.107
Before last night,

17:20.140 --> 17:22.709
everyone who walked through
that front door was invited.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.378
Well, hey, let's be grateful
that it wasn't worse.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.679
That what they took were

17:26.713 --> 17:28.515
just things and things
can be replaced...

17:28.548 --> 17:29.516
Things?!

17:29.549 --> 17:32.085
Some of those things were
lifetime memories.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.486
I mean, really good memories.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.490
Even the bad ones,
they belonged to us.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.461
Somebody violated that.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.662
I-I understand.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.834
Look, I worked on

17:47.867 --> 17:49.402
over 50 criminal
cases, I'm certain

17:49.436 --> 17:51.138
I can crack a minor larceny.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.240
All I need
is the right data.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.474
I'll tell you what I can do,

17:54.507 --> 17:57.277
I can apply a Heterogeneous
Poisson Process

17:57.310 --> 17:59.346
on the DVD thefts,

17:59.379 --> 18:00.747
and cross-reference that

18:00.780 --> 18:04.384
with data and stats
on stolen blenders.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.287
I mean, you know, it'll probably
yield some sparse results,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.456
- to say the least...
- Yeah, well, whatever.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.191
You know, um,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.559
I don't want
to sound corny,

18:12.592 --> 18:13.793
but I've always looked
at this house

18:13.826 --> 18:15.362
as an heirloom for you and Don.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.830
Well, then I paid two percent
over market value

18:17.864 --> 18:19.466
for the "heirloom."

18:19.499 --> 18:20.467
Well, capital gains
notwithstanding,

18:20.500 --> 18:21.701
this has been home for 30 years.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.702
DON:
Hey.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.571
What's up with the no beer?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.506
You could thank the
burglars for that one.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.808
You look beat.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.278
Yeah, I've just spent three
hours waiting for some prints

18:31.311 --> 18:33.146
that came back smudged.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.514
- Smudged? How smudged?
- What do you mean?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.249
- Smudged.
- Only 'cause

18:36.283 --> 18:37.584
there's very exciting work
being done

18:37.617 --> 18:39.519
with Deconvolution Algorithms.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.488
Yeah, as in that would fix
my fingerprints?

18:41.521 --> 18:42.622
Yeah.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.260
Now, the principle here
is fairly simple.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.729
Uh, picture a sprinter

18:49.762 --> 18:51.164
and a photographer
with a cheap camera

18:51.198 --> 18:52.732
Now, without the right
shutter speed,

18:52.765 --> 18:54.567
the sprinter's gonna smear
across the frame.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.804
Edges are blurred and fine
details are no longer visible.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.574
A Wavelet-based Deconvolution
Algorithm analyzes the image,

19:01.608 --> 19:05.445
sharpens the edges
and restores the details--

19:05.478 --> 19:08.748
to find the picture
beneath the smear.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.584
The same technique was used
to fix the fuzzy vision

19:11.618 --> 19:13.586
of the original
Hubble Telescope.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.423
And if we apply
a similar algorithm

19:16.456 --> 19:17.924
to our smudged
fingerprints...

19:17.957 --> 19:19.626
DAVID: It's like the computer
putting

19:19.659 --> 19:20.760
on corrective lenses.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.569
The prints in the nose comb
belong to Mike Daley.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.638
He works in AeroNomics'
IT department.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.606
Because of their government
contracts,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.908
all employees have to register
their fingerprints.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.544
IT guy would probably know how

19:37.577 --> 19:39.246
to tamper
with the flight computer.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.180
All right,
go get him.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.987
(knocking on door)
Mike Daley!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.856
FBI! Open up.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.294
(metal clanging)

19:54.327 --> 19:55.562
- Up or down?
- I'll take up.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.806
Hey!

20:25.057 --> 20:27.360
*

20:38.671 --> 20:40.973
Bet I can pull the trigger
before you hit the gas.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.855
I know how this looks.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.057
Looks like
your fingerprints

20:58.090 --> 21:00.927
all over the nose cone
of the company plane.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.696
Two days later, it's
smashed to a million pieces,

21:03.730 --> 21:04.931
five people are dead.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.333
You reprogrammed
the flight computer.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.968
I always reprogram
the flight computer.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.773
The FAA issues update software

21:13.806 --> 21:15.775
every six
months, um...

21:15.808 --> 21:18.845
new approach patterns,
decommissioned runways.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.979
I'm the guy who installs them.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.514
We're a small company.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.749
I help out where I can.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.517
The plane's mechanic

21:24.551 --> 21:26.653
John Wellner is too big
to get into the nose cone,

21:26.686 --> 21:27.754
so he has me do it.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.057
Now, you see...

21:31.991 --> 21:34.327
that still doesn't explain

21:34.361 --> 21:36.996
why you went out the
window when we showed up.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.632
(sighs)

21:40.733 --> 21:44.337
Mr. Helm said that, um,

21:44.371 --> 21:47.907
a computer malfunction
brought the plane down.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.776
I panicked.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.445
Maybe I installed it wrong.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.080
Maybe...

21:54.113 --> 21:56.549
I killed my friends.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.421
Only one problem
with his story.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.924
The FAA hasn't issued
any recent updates.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.760
So what did Wellner
have him install?

22:07.794 --> 22:11.364
So, Colby, where
are we with Wellner?

22:11.398 --> 22:12.231
Well, he's not at home,

22:12.264 --> 22:13.933
not at the hangar,
not at AeroNomics,

22:13.966 --> 22:15.635
and he's not answering
his cell phone.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.302
All right,

22:16.335 --> 22:17.303
so he's in the wind, right?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.971
Yeah, and I ran a deeper
background check on him.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.773
Clean, this guy is not.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.475
Used to run
an air charter business

22:22.509 --> 22:23.610
out of the Florida Keys.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.445
DEA suspected
it was bankrolled

22:25.478 --> 22:26.913
by a Salvadorian
drug runner

22:26.946 --> 22:28.014
named Victor Morelos.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.483
Wellner's a drug smuggler?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.485
Well, never proven, but he
tested positive for cocaine

22:32.519 --> 22:33.653
during a flight physical,

22:33.686 --> 22:34.754
lost his license.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.022
Ended up drifting
back west

22:36.055 --> 22:38.458
and got a job as a mechanic
for AeroNomics.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.527
All right, well, we've got
enough for a warrant, right?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.795
So, let's hit his apartment.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.504
Agent Granger.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.906
Hey, Ranger Williams.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.107
I just wanted
to check in,

22:55.141 --> 22:59.111
see if you had made any progress
on finding Phil's killer.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.780
We're working
a few leads.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.516
You know, I can't really
discuss any of the details

23:03.550 --> 23:05.718
while the investigation
is still open.

23:05.752 --> 23:06.986
I'm sorry.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.821
Don't apologize.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.123
Part of coming here was
really just an excuse

23:11.157 --> 23:12.459
to get off the mountain.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.095
Without Phil,
it's just me.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.065
I couldn't really figure out
where else to go.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.968
You know, um...

23:22.001 --> 23:23.202
DAVID: Hey, Colby, warrant for
Wellner's apartment

23:23.235 --> 23:24.837
just came through.

23:24.871 --> 23:25.838
Edgerton's waiting

23:25.872 --> 23:28.007
in the war room.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.082
You're going to get
through this.

23:42.855 --> 23:43.823
What?

23:43.856 --> 23:45.091
More with the
plane crash?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.159
Somebody's tricked
the airplane's computer

23:47.193 --> 23:48.995
into thinking it was
4,000 feet higher

23:49.028 --> 23:51.030
than it really was.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.932
So, so the crash
was intentional?

23:52.965 --> 23:53.966
That's why
we're dissecting

23:54.000 --> 23:56.503
code line by line.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.906
What's confusing is there's
so much code in this thing.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.140
So, we've decided

24:01.173 --> 24:03.142
to play a little trick

24:03.175 --> 24:04.777
on the program.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.245
We're rolling back
the internal clock

24:06.278 --> 24:10.650
and fooling it into thinking
the plane hasn't crashed yet.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.698
And we've just faked
the plane crash.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.800
The extra code
hasn't been accessed.

24:27.834 --> 24:28.901
Really?

24:28.935 --> 24:29.902
There's nothing.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.137
Well, then, what's it there for?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.138
Well...

24:32.171 --> 24:33.506
your job isn't done yet.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.941
Hitting the side
of the mountain,

24:34.974 --> 24:36.776
that pretty much ends
the flight.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.779
Well, the flight's computer
is its diary, so...

24:39.812 --> 24:41.180
its job isn't over

24:41.213 --> 24:43.983
until Mom and Dad read
all the good parts.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.118
She's right.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.754
I mean, the program
isn't finished running

24:47.787 --> 24:49.956
until the NTSB downloads
the information.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.157
Right.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.831
(beeping)

24:58.865 --> 25:00.733
What was that?

25:00.767 --> 25:02.835
I don't know.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.073
It deleted itself.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.676
It doesn't want
to be seen.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.182
Any luck finding Wellner?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.017
Eh, just tossed his apartment.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.686
Empty hangers in the closet,
underwear drawer empty,

25:19.719 --> 25:20.687
no toothbrush.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.689
Sounds like he's
not coming back.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.791
You find any clues to
where he might have gone?

25:24.824 --> 25:26.626
Sure.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.194
Guess who got
to go Dumpster-diving

25:28.227 --> 25:29.762
behind Wellner's
apartment?

25:29.796 --> 25:32.565
Oh, seniority is
a son of a bitch.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.200
Wellner had to pull up
in a hurry.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.869
Guys in a hurry make mistakes,
leave a trail.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.137
Shall we?

25:59.726 --> 26:03.029
Four days ago,
Wellner drained an IRA account

26:03.062 --> 26:05.665
despite a ten percent penalty
for early withdrawals.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.768
Bought a Gortex coat,
wasn't in his closet.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.136
That would make sense.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.271
Wellner's Web printouts are
of these little houses

26:12.304 --> 26:15.708
up in Washington State,
Montana and Idaho.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.644
Retiring to the mountains
to do some fishing.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.278
Here's a padlock.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.814
Could be for anything.

26:21.848 --> 26:26.619
Could be... for
a storage facility in Van Nuys.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.254
D-48.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.256
Storage manager ID'd
Wellner's photo.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.358
Said Wellner paid cash two
days ago for the locker.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.292
Here it is.

26:47.073 --> 26:47.940
Just an unschooled guess,

26:47.974 --> 26:50.276
but that looks like
a scramjet to me.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.311
They killed six people
to get this thing.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.714
Think they would have moved it
out of L.A. by now.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.254
It's Sinclair.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.322
Yeah, we found
the scramjet.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.292
David.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.303
John Wellner.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.972
Looks like he didn't make it out
of town either.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.178
Gunshot to the head,
just like the ranger.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.047
Shell casing's
the same caliber.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.449
The tenants have
24-hour access.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.985
They get in the outside gate
with a PIN code.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.453
So when did
Wellner use his?

27:34.486 --> 27:37.356
At 4:48 P.M., and there was
no one else in or out

27:37.389 --> 27:39.058
in 30 minutes
either side of that.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.192
So no witnesses.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.193
Right.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.128
Come on.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.869
So, Wellner gives Daley
a bad program

27:49.902 --> 27:51.738
for the flight computer,
crashes the plane.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.372
And his partners wait
up on the mountain

27:53.405 --> 27:54.473
to collect the cargo.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.975
It's one heck
of a partnership.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.276
Put a hole
in Wellner's head

27:57.309 --> 27:58.911
and leave him
in his own storage locker?

27:58.945 --> 28:00.813
Yeah, they must have known
we were getting close to him,

28:00.847 --> 28:01.981
didn't want him to talk.

28:02.014 --> 28:02.949
Why leave the
scramjet behind?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.786
The locker's rent's been
paid three years in advance.

28:06.819 --> 28:07.820
Yeah, you got
to figure

28:07.854 --> 28:08.721
three years from now,

28:08.755 --> 28:11.057
the prototype's worth less,
not more.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.325
Makes you wonder why
the hell six people died.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.996
DON:
Why would someone crash

28:17.029 --> 28:18.731
that plane, steal
the scramjet

28:18.765 --> 28:19.999
and mothball it?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.334
I don't know.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.804
Better figure it out; we got
a lot of bodies piling up here.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.673
What do you mean?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.009
Your mechanic,
John Wellner, he's dead.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.043
Bullet to the head.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.913
Look, we know he was
working with someone else

28:33.946 --> 28:35.782
and we know you had
a lot of info

28:35.815 --> 28:36.783
at your fingertips.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.817
You keep saying
how important

28:37.850 --> 28:39.351
that thing is-- I can see

28:39.385 --> 28:42.488
where the company would pay you
to kill the project. Look.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.489
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.828
Just hold tight.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.264
All right, so
what do you need?

28:52.298 --> 28:53.833
The plane crash
had nothing to do

28:53.866 --> 28:55.267
with stealing
that scramjet engine.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.268
What?

28:56.302 --> 28:57.303
The scramjet's a mislead.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.772
Look, did you hook
the plane's flight computer

28:59.806 --> 29:01.373
into your mainframe yet?

29:01.407 --> 29:03.242
Yeah, that's how we got
the reprogramming evidence.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.276
Well, then,

29:04.310 --> 29:05.077
the program's almost
certainly vectored its way

29:05.111 --> 29:06.112
into the FAA's
computers by now.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.214
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you talking about?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.215
What program?

29:09.248 --> 29:11.217
This whole exercise was designed

29:11.250 --> 29:12.919
so that someone
could place

29:12.952 --> 29:16.055
a malicious program
into the FAA's computer.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.790
- What does this program do?
- I don't know yet.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.059
I need access to
the FAA's mainframe.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.061
Do you know how guarded
that access is?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.062
It's the FAA, guys.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.832
It's what he
says he needs.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.035
I'll make a call.

29:29.068 --> 29:32.404
Thank you.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.306
- Stolen blenders?
- That's not this.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.242
That's the break-in,
I'm working on the break-in.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.810
What, Dad's not all right?

29:37.844 --> 29:40.246
That house means a lot to him.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.048
Yeah.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.916
Well, it's like the screens,
remember?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.151
Every summer
with the screens.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.352
Right?

29:46.385 --> 29:48.287
Putting new screens in every
single window of that house.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.990
Climbing out on that roof, and
then the flies come in anyway.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.825
Right.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.861
Just his way of checking in
with the house once a year.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.428
Yeah, you're right.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.064
Charlie, you have some fans
at the FAA.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.332
If they've got a problem,
they want you to find it.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.433
Great.
All right, get to it.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.135
All right,
come on.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.853
Review board called me in
on the spree killing case.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.424
Figured it was about
what we did to Buck.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.994
All they wanted to talk about
was you dinging Crystal Hoyle.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.566
I told them you had
the clearer shot.

30:38.637 --> 30:39.939
Is that true?

30:39.972 --> 30:41.874
I figure you had your reasons.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.186
Bad news first, well,
the bad news is that

30:54.220 --> 30:55.888
the rogue program has fully

30:55.922 --> 30:57.957
rooted itself
in the FAA's computers.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.259
Good news is that we don't
have to ground air traffic.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.660
So no mid-air collisions?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.629
This one won't
even lose your luggage.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.664
It was designed
for something very different.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.967
Well, what was
it designed for?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.468
Uh, you ever hear of "squawk"?

31:09.501 --> 31:12.138
Yeah, it's a seagull who wakes
me up every morning.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.006
Not just a seagull.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.975
An entire bird sanctuary.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.478
Each bird has it's own
unique squawk.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.547
Enough so that
a bird watcher spying

31:21.580 --> 31:23.249
from the ground can
identify each bird

31:23.282 --> 31:24.550
just by its sound.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.054
Now think of the bird watcher
as the FAA's radar,

31:28.087 --> 31:30.923
and each plane has
its own unique signal

31:30.957 --> 31:34.060
so that Air Traffic Control
can identify each plane

31:34.093 --> 31:36.495
by the code, or "squawk"
it receives.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.968
TOMBRELLO: The squawk is sent
from a transponder

31:42.001 --> 31:45.071
in the plane, which tells
the radar not only location,

31:45.104 --> 31:47.673
but also ground
designation and trajectory.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.509
That's right, now these
are all the planes

31:50.542 --> 31:52.144
flying over the city right now.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.312
And each with its own

31:53.345 --> 31:55.281
unique designation.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.483
Let's say I programmed the virus

31:57.516 --> 31:59.351
to listen for...

31:59.385 --> 32:01.387
This one here.
So I enter in its

32:01.420 --> 32:03.222
squawk code.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.224
(beeping)

32:07.026 --> 32:09.028
Now it's gone.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.596
What happened to it?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.664
Whoever controls
this program can make

32:12.698 --> 32:14.967
any plane in Southern California

32:15.001 --> 32:16.702
invisible.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.278
CHARLIE:
Consider M.C. Escher's

32:26.312 --> 32:27.713
lithograph of the stairs.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.150
Escher was famous for leading
the subjects of his artwork

32:31.183 --> 32:33.185
back to where they started.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.254
Like the path of the monks
in his drawing,

32:35.287 --> 32:37.023
in Strange Loop Theory,

32:37.056 --> 32:40.059
all math as well as music
and even biology,

32:40.092 --> 32:41.527
can fold back in on itself,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.395
and check in with its origin.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.364
So a program that jumps
from computer to computer

32:45.397 --> 32:48.000
can leave certain clues
that take us back to its author.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.236
Amita and I traced

32:50.269 --> 32:53.572
the program's code
via its Strange Loop.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.007
And took you back
to the guy who wrote it?

32:55.041 --> 32:58.110
It took me back
to an AeroNomics Computer used

32:58.144 --> 33:01.080
- by an IT technician...
- Mike Daley.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.481
Charlie, are you saying
he's behind this?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.616
At least as far
as authoring the code.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.452
- Well, now we know why he ran.
- This program,

33:06.485 --> 33:08.787
is it tampering with the FAA's
computers right now?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.523
No, it's still waiting
for an activation code.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.360
You wrote the program

33:14.393 --> 33:16.528
- You crashed the plane.
- We've done this before,

33:16.562 --> 33:18.597
- that was Wellner.
- No, this...

33:18.630 --> 33:20.732
is Wellner.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.538
I want a lawyer.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.540
Why? What for?
You're free to go.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.444
Yeah, go ahead. Take off, right?

33:32.478 --> 33:33.712
I'll tell you how it's
going to go down though.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.215
When they find you-- and they
will, pal-- they're gonna take

33:36.248 --> 33:38.350
a nine millimeter pistol
and they're gonna put a hole

33:38.384 --> 33:39.785
in your head just like that,

33:39.818 --> 33:41.120
and just like Hadwin.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.222
EDGERTON:
Not every guy

33:43.255 --> 33:45.357
gets to know the caliber
of bullet that'll kill them.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.563
Nobody was supposed to die.
They said that nobody

33:51.597 --> 33:52.831
- was going to get hurt.
- Are you kidding me?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.800
You wrote a program that screwed
with the altimeter of a plane

33:54.833 --> 33:55.901
and it crashed
into a mountain!

33:55.934 --> 33:58.070
What the hell did you
think was going to happen?!

33:58.104 --> 34:00.172
You know, at least your
partners had the guts

34:00.206 --> 34:02.341
to pull a trigger when they
killed Wellner and the ranger.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.610
You hid behind a damn computer!

34:04.643 --> 34:06.478
How could I know about
the ranger showing up so fast?

34:06.512 --> 34:09.581
Look, I see three scenarios.
Okay, one, you walk out of here,

34:09.615 --> 34:11.583
you wind up like that-- two,
you go down for this alone,

34:11.617 --> 34:14.086
- you take a seat on death row.
- Three, you rat out

34:14.120 --> 34:15.487
your buddies and you save
your own miserable ass.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.761
The guy behind it,
Wellner knew him.

34:22.794 --> 34:24.363
We need a name!

34:24.396 --> 34:25.864
I didn't want to know.
My job was to write

34:25.897 --> 34:27.566
the programs and figure
out a way to backdoor

34:27.599 --> 34:28.834
the FAA's computer.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.502
How were you going to make
any money on it?

34:30.536 --> 34:32.538
The backdoor doesn't work
without the pass code.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.673
Wellner's friend,
the guy with the truck,

34:34.706 --> 34:36.442
he was going
to pay us $2 million.

34:38.477 --> 34:39.611
I'll do anything.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.147
I'll cooperate.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.748
Well, we're going to find out
if you mean that.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.251
DAVID:
I played a hunch,

34:45.284 --> 34:46.785
showed Daley a photo array.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.621
He picked out
Victor Morelos.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.323
This guy ran drugs with Wellner,
right?

34:51.357 --> 34:52.391
Makes sense.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.160
A smuggler's plane,
even without a transponder,

34:54.193 --> 34:55.594
has a chance of being seen.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.230
This program erases
the transponder number,

34:58.264 --> 35:00.132
and the FAA won't even
look for the plane.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.301
Yeah, so he'd basically
own the border.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.471
Hey, don't I get

35:05.504 --> 35:07.573
- a bulletproof vest?
- What for?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.575
Morelos always goes
for the head shot.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.711
Just make sure you get him
to take that program.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.780
The more you can get
him to say, the better.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.583
Um...

35:17.616 --> 35:18.784
I don't know about this.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.354
COLBY: Right now, everything we
have on Morelos

35:22.388 --> 35:23.655
is circumstantial.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.591
But you on the other hand,

35:25.624 --> 35:26.725
you're a prime candidate

35:26.758 --> 35:28.427
for Guantanamo Bay.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.395
DAVID:
Yeah, and about ten or twelve

35:29.428 --> 35:31.663
years of alternative
interrogation methods

35:31.697 --> 35:33.565
to look forward to.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.201
Yeah, relax, you've got
the fifth best shot

35:35.234 --> 35:36.435
in the country
covering your ass.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.537
- Hey, fourth.
- Right.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.611
You don't want to ask
how I moved up one spot.

35:47.746 --> 35:48.647
Button your shirt.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.192
I've been thinking,

36:00.226 --> 36:01.693
maybe I take my chances

36:01.727 --> 36:02.928
with Homeland Security
after all.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.464
EDGERTON:
$50 says the kid rabbits.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.633
DON (on radio):
Too late.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.469
Got a silver Ford pickup
just pulled in.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.903
EDGERTON (on radio):
F-250, I got it.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.677
Hey.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.317
We good?

36:25.351 --> 36:26.618
Good.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.221
Yeah, sure. We're good.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.689
Well?

36:30.722 --> 36:32.458
You bring it?

36:32.491 --> 36:35.294
You bring my final payment?

36:35.327 --> 36:37.229
Well, first we've got to
make sure that this thing

36:37.263 --> 36:38.697
of yours actually works.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.832
Sure. I got the stick drive

36:40.866 --> 36:42.868
- right here.
- Whoa-ho.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.538
Mikey, take it easy with the
hand in the pocket, okay?

36:46.572 --> 36:48.307
Take it easy. I trust you.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.442
My boy here's
a little overprotective.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.783
You're shaking. Calm down.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.451
You really think I'd
try to pull anything

36:59.485 --> 37:00.686
after seeing what you did
to Wellner?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.024
What did I do to Wellner, Mike?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.726
He's blowing it.

37:07.759 --> 37:08.960
DON (on radio):
It's going south, guys.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.264
What did I do to Wellner, Mike?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.665
Uh...

37:13.699 --> 37:16.402
Who've you been talking to,
Mike? What do you know?

37:16.435 --> 37:17.336
(speaking Spanish)

37:18.770 --> 37:20.639
- FBI! Don't move!
- Back up!

37:20.672 --> 37:21.973
FBI! FBI!

37:22.007 --> 37:23.309
Put your hands up!

37:23.342 --> 37:24.476
Put them up!

37:26.645 --> 37:27.646
Back up right now.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.780
Drop it!

37:28.814 --> 37:30.682
I will kill him.
You know I'll do this.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.783
You know I'll do this!

37:31.817 --> 37:32.584
MORELOS:
Back up!

37:32.618 --> 37:34.486
I'm walking out
of here right now.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.787
Get away!

37:35.821 --> 37:37.623
Drop the gun!

37:37.656 --> 37:39.024
Back up!

37:40.959 --> 37:43.028
(gunshot)

37:44.330 --> 37:45.631
- Put your hands up!
- Get down!

37:45.664 --> 37:46.598
Get down!

37:48.066 --> 37:49.968
You hit?
You okay?

37:52.371 --> 37:54.740
That ought to make me
number three.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.546
(birds singing)

38:00.579 --> 38:06.918
* She says, "Wake up,
it's no use pretending..." *

38:06.952 --> 38:09.588
Thanks.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.856
For being here.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.059
* Birds are leaving...

38:14.092 --> 38:17.763
I can understand why
you guys moved up here.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.898
Away from the city,

38:19.931 --> 38:22.501
you almost forget
where you are.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.906
I'll never forget.

38:30.942 --> 38:35.914
* Naked as we came

38:35.947 --> 38:42.921
* One will spread our...

38:42.954 --> 38:46.692
* Ashes 'round the yard .

38:51.863 --> 38:53.932
MILLIE:
No. No chess.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.368
I win, you pout.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.036
Well, we're not
playing poker.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.938
I'm not your personal ATM.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.039
Aw, come on...

39:01.072 --> 39:02.841
- One game.
- Hey, come on.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.110
You've said no to Scrabble,
Jenga, Battleship

39:05.143 --> 39:06.745
and air hockey.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.847
- Wussy games.
- Hey.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.981
Hey, Charlie.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.750
I got a breakthrough
on the burglary.

39:11.783 --> 39:12.951
- Hey, Millie.
- Hey, hey, Charlie.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.654
So, I've mapped out

39:15.687 --> 39:18.056
an associative model of crime,

39:18.089 --> 39:21.159
based on the victim experience,
our experience.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.695
It is kind of cool
being a major component

39:23.729 --> 39:24.730
in a criminal equation.

39:24.763 --> 39:25.964
Yeah, and so, so?

39:25.997 --> 39:26.798
I can tell you the guy's
definitely

39:26.832 --> 39:28.033
in Los Angeles.
I can tell you that.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.537
Oh. He's in Los Angeles.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.904
CHARLIE: Don't say it like that.
A few more days,

39:32.938 --> 39:34.105
a little more data collected...

39:34.139 --> 39:35.941
I might have
a short list to give

39:35.974 --> 39:36.975
- to the police.
- DON: Hello. Hey.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.109
Hey, in here.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.678
Look what I got.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.448
- Hey, Millie, how're you doing?
- Good, how are you?

39:42.481 --> 39:44.650
CHARLIE:
Wait a second, is that...?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.685
- My laptop.
- Your laptop.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.054
Yeah, I had Pasadena PD
track the GPS inside.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.790
Of course! The GPS

39:51.823 --> 39:52.758
in your laptop.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.560
It's standard now on all models
since 2005.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.995
They just punch in a code
and there it was blinking

39:57.028 --> 39:58.797
away at, uh,
3rd and Lucas.

39:58.830 --> 39:59.931
What do you got here?

39:59.965 --> 40:01.833
A rather
long way around.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.802
Stole my collar.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.971
Your collar, huh?

40:06.004 --> 40:07.439
I would've gotten him.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.575
In six or seven years, maybe.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.976
At least I was working on it.
I wasn't sitting

40:11.009 --> 40:12.978
- around playing games.
- Ooh, well...

40:13.011 --> 40:14.145
Who wins the games, huh?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.814
Millie Finch, I believe

40:15.847 --> 40:18.950
- 12, and the Eppes boys zero.
- You want to put that

40:18.984 --> 40:20.619
record on the line
with a game of spoons?

40:20.652 --> 40:21.687
Spoons?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.922
What, you boys play games
with your cutlery now?

40:23.955 --> 40:25.023
I have an idea that it's

40:25.056 --> 40:26.792
- right up your alley.
- Oh, yeah?

40:26.825 --> 40:28.627
All right, hand
me your spoons.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.195
Well, you guys ate
off both of these.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.730
Do we have other...?

40:31.763 --> 40:34.666
Come on, Charlie.
Man up. What are you?

40:34.700 --> 40:37.035
This house is kind of a weird.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.137
Who wants a beer? Anyone?

40:39.170 --> 40:41.139
There's still no beer.
