WEBVTT

00:08.482 --> 00:11.896
[tense music playing]

00:15.758 --> 00:17.896
[Parker] We spent a lot
of money this year.

00:17.931 --> 00:20.034
And we don't have a dollar
in revenue,

00:20.068 --> 00:23.482
so we are gonna be financially
in a very big hole.

00:23.517 --> 00:26.068
And I don't like
having money problems.

00:26.103 --> 00:27.793
Who does?

00:29.517 --> 00:31.931
[narrator]
Twenty-eight-year-old
Parker Schnabel

00:31.965 --> 00:34.724
is walking a financial
tightrope.

00:36.586 --> 00:39.379
He's dropped $15 million

00:39.413 --> 00:41.655
to buy the Dominion Creek
claim.

00:42.862 --> 00:45.655
Now, he's spending
millions more

00:45.689 --> 00:47.724
to try and get down
to paydirt...

00:50.689 --> 00:55.068
and a potential
$160 million payout.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.551
But if he doesn't do it soon,

00:59.586 --> 01:01.517
he'll run out of money

01:01.551 --> 01:04.688
and will have
to shut down for good.

01:04.724 --> 01:06.551
As we're working towards
getting things set up

01:06.586 --> 01:07.758
here at Dominion,

01:07.793 --> 01:10.206
it means opening up
a lot of area.

01:11.275 --> 01:12.724
The big thing is here,

01:12.758 --> 01:14.965
unless a wash plant
is running,

01:15.000 --> 01:16.689
we're just spending money.

01:16.724 --> 01:19.862
And we're spending money
like we never have before.

01:21.551 --> 01:23.241
[Parker] Well, at Dominion,

01:23.275 --> 01:25.137
the ground is deeper than
anything we've mined before.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.068
And really we need
to have some money come in.

01:28.103 --> 01:30.689
Tyson's target
needs to fire up

01:30.724 --> 01:32.862
for our first round
of sluicin'

01:32.896 --> 01:35.620
on Ken and Stuart's ground,

01:35.655 --> 01:39.793
which should be good for like
1,500 or 1,700 ounces.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.000
[narrator] To get some money
coming in,

01:44.033 --> 01:46.275
Parker's counting on a claim
he's leased

01:46.310 --> 01:49.241
from Ken Tatlow
and Stuart Schmidt.

01:51.931 --> 01:54.413
He wants plant boss Tyson Lee

01:54.448 --> 01:57.620
to be delivering gold
from the Unforgiven cut

01:57.655 --> 01:59.137
by the end of the week.

02:00.896 --> 02:03.551
So I've been down here at
Ken's for a couple weeks now

02:03.586 --> 02:05.965
and still yet
to be a wash plant going,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.793
and we really need
to get some gold coming in.

02:12.448 --> 02:13.379
Yo, yo.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.448
What up? What up?

02:14.482 --> 02:15.655
Boom truck on this side

02:15.689 --> 02:17.655
and have the excavator
on that side.

02:21.275 --> 02:25.620
[narrator] Sluicifer
is Parker's prized $600,000,

02:25.655 --> 02:28.413
240-yard-an-hour wash plant.

02:30.103 --> 02:31.931
[Mike] Tyson, you want me
on that side?

02:31.965 --> 02:34.827
[narrator] To help move it
to the Unforgiven cut,

02:34.862 --> 02:37.344
Tyson's called in
trusted friend

02:37.379 --> 02:40.413
and expert truck driver
Mike Tupper.

02:42.172 --> 02:43.758
[Mike] Tyson wants me
to get set up here.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.586
We're gonna lift
the conveyor up.

02:48.413 --> 02:50.241
Tyson gave me the call
last week

02:50.275 --> 02:52.206
and asked me to come up

02:52.241 --> 02:54.067
and they're super
short-staffed.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.758
Said he was getting close
on movin' Sluicifer.

02:57.793 --> 02:59.551
So I got a flight.

02:59.586 --> 03:01.068
Today's the big day.

03:01.551 --> 03:03.034
It's moving day.

03:07.379 --> 03:09.068
[Tyson] Okay. Go up, Alec.

03:09.103 --> 03:11.206
[machinery whirring]

03:13.620 --> 03:14.793
Watch your boom truck.

03:17.448 --> 03:21.172
[Alec] I've worked for Tupper
for, well, since high school.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.620
He's a huge help.

03:23.655 --> 03:26.827
The amount of work we get
done together is crazy.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.862
I really wanna see
this wash plant up and going

03:30.896 --> 03:33.517
'cause I really want
to get sluicing.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.379
We'll get the wash plant
on sideways

03:38.413 --> 03:40.034
and we'll head down.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.689
We'll drag the plant back
to the edge of the ramp,

03:42.724 --> 03:45.620
back the truck underneath,
and then pull it on.

03:47.793 --> 03:50.517
You wanna be my eyes
loading me up?

03:50.551 --> 03:52.103
[narrator] At 35 feet,

03:52.137 --> 03:54.241
Sluicifer is too long

03:54.275 --> 03:57.000
to fit directly
on the back of the lowboy.

03:58.413 --> 04:00.586
[Mike] Keep going,
keep going, keep going.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.551
Watch that doesn't tug.
You're good.

04:04.758 --> 04:07.137
[narrator]
So the crew load it sideways,

04:07.172 --> 04:09.655
hoping they can
balance it perfectly.

04:10.379 --> 04:11.965
[Mike] Here we go.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.586
[machinery whirring]

04:13.620 --> 04:14.620
[Tyson] It's tight.

04:19.862 --> 04:22.137
You know, if we [bleep]
something up,

04:22.172 --> 04:23.551
this wash plant isn't runnin'.

04:25.103 --> 04:28.000
Is that the biggest load
you've ever hauled, Tupper?

04:28.034 --> 04:30.586
Yup. Should be interesting.
There's some

04:30.620 --> 04:31.655
nice tight corners
there and...

04:31.689 --> 04:32.862
-[Alec] Oh, yeah.
-...some steep parts.

04:32.896 --> 04:34.413
-We'll get her done.
-Yeah.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.517
When you're hauling
this thing, it's really heavy

04:36.551 --> 04:38.344
and it really rocks
side-to-side.

04:40.034 --> 04:42.517
Go slow
and just ride out the wave.

04:47.379 --> 04:50.620
[narrator] From the laydown
yard at Parker's old
Scribner camp,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.137
Tupper will haul
Sluicifer five miles

04:56.172 --> 04:58.965
along a narrow,
winding dirt track,

05:00.551 --> 05:02.862
down a 100-foot steep bank,

05:04.379 --> 05:07.241
and across
a 20-foot wide creek,

05:08.965 --> 05:13.103
before the final run to Ken
and Stuart's Unforgiven cut.

05:15.689 --> 05:16.793
You excited, Tup?

05:18.103 --> 05:19.103
I'm excited.

05:20.137 --> 05:21.103
[Tyson] Yeah?

05:21.137 --> 05:22.965
[Mike] And nervous.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.137
Well, it's probably the most
expensive thing I've moved.

05:26.172 --> 05:27.586
[Tyson] Okay.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.620
[Alec] Good luck!

05:32.586 --> 05:34.758
Oh, yeah.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.379
Got our landlocked
pirate ship on the move.

05:44.448 --> 05:46.620
Tupper's the man
for the job today.

05:48.793 --> 05:51.379
Done the most trucking out
of anyone in this area.

05:53.827 --> 05:55.551
All right, here's a little
tighter section.

05:55.586 --> 05:56.931
He'll go a little slower.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.586
[Mike] A little bushwhackin'.

06:02.172 --> 06:04.000
All right, now we got
the river crossing.

06:08.137 --> 06:09.862
I don't know
what's going on here.

06:09.896 --> 06:11.517
This river was definitely
not running

06:11.551 --> 06:12.689
like this this morning,

06:13.655 --> 06:17.344
and now it's definitely wider.

06:18.551 --> 06:19.517
Here we go.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.758
Creek's about a hundred
and 50 feet wide right now,

06:23.793 --> 06:25.758
and I [bleep] you not.

06:25.793 --> 06:27.379
So something's going on
upstream.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.137
[narrator]
The creek has expanded

06:31.172 --> 06:33.931
and is full
of hidden dangers...

06:33.965 --> 06:36.172
[Mike] Little tippy.

06:36.206 --> 06:38.724
[narrator] ...that could roll
the perilously-balanced

06:38.758 --> 06:39.793
wash plant.

06:39.827 --> 06:41.379
Whoa! [bleep].

06:48.034 --> 06:50.344
I just don't wanna get stuck
here in the middle.

06:52.275 --> 06:53.241
There we go.

06:54.896 --> 06:56.517
All right. We're rolling now.

06:56.551 --> 06:58.655
[engine revving]

07:02.068 --> 07:03.413
[horn honks]

07:03.448 --> 07:04.482
[Tyson] Whoo!

07:04.517 --> 07:06.620
Great truckin', Tupper.
Great truckin'.

07:10.275 --> 07:11.655
That was good, eh?

07:11.689 --> 07:14.482
Some of the tires were off
the ground on this side.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.586
I was wondering
if you were stopping

07:15.620 --> 07:16.758
to change your shorts.

07:17.827 --> 07:19.034
Got her done.

07:20.034 --> 07:21.827
-Got her done.
-[Tyson] High five.

07:21.862 --> 07:23.482
-Nice.
-Good job.

07:23.517 --> 07:26.862
Tomorrow, we'll start
reassembling the plant,

07:26.896 --> 07:29.034
get it all buttoned up
and hopefully up on the pad

07:29.068 --> 07:30.551
and fire her up.

07:30.586 --> 07:31.620
-Lit her rip?
-[Tyson] Yeah.

07:31.655 --> 07:32.965
-Okay, bud.
-[Tyson] Thanks, man.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.310
[Mike] Nice work, hey?
Thank you.

07:34.344 --> 07:36.103
-Thanks for the call.
-[Tyson] Good truckin'.

07:36.137 --> 07:37.034
[Mike] Yeah.

07:41.068 --> 07:43.344
[narrator] Tyson must now race

07:43.379 --> 07:45.206
to get Sluicifer up
and running

07:45.241 --> 07:48.034
to get gold
by the end of the week.

07:51.896 --> 07:53.103
There's still a lot of work
ahead of us.

07:53.137 --> 07:55.103
We still have to get the
feeder in, Super Stacker in,

07:55.137 --> 07:58.448
generator in, pipeline in,

07:58.482 --> 07:59.689
and then test everything.

07:59.724 --> 08:02.310
So, we're not out
of the dark yet.

08:03.206 --> 08:04.655
We gotta keep on track.

08:04.689 --> 08:07.000
And hopefully
we'll be sluicin' soon.

08:15.655 --> 08:19.379
[tense music playing]

08:21.379 --> 08:22.724
[sighs]

08:23.482 --> 08:24.931
My hopes this year...

08:26.068 --> 08:28.448
Be profitable,
make some money back.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.103
Most days, I'm fine with it.

08:31.137 --> 08:33.241
Some days
it's just, uh, it's miserable

08:33.275 --> 08:35.586
but it's necessary
'cause it's the pathway back.

08:38.068 --> 08:40.931
[narrator] One hundred miles
east at the Indian River,

08:40.965 --> 08:43.517
Rick Ness is fighting back

08:43.551 --> 08:45.586
after a year off mining

08:45.620 --> 08:47.931
left him with nearly nothing.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.448
There is a lot that
I have to prove to myself,

08:51.482 --> 08:52.482
that I can do it.

08:52.517 --> 08:55.275
There's also a huge
opportunity to fail hard.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.241
It's stressful
and it's a [bleep] job,

08:57.275 --> 08:59.000
but it's also my [bleep] life.

09:01.689 --> 09:05.413
[narrator] Rick has
strategically started
the season off slow,

09:05.448 --> 09:07.000
bringing on a skeleton crew

09:07.034 --> 09:09.275
to work through
stockpiled paydirt.

09:10.931 --> 09:14.689
So far, it's delivered
77 ounces of gold

09:14.724 --> 09:18.068
worth $150,000.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.172
[Rick] You know,
we've been doing fine

09:22.206 --> 09:23.448
just running the stockpile.

09:23.482 --> 09:25.241
We're putting gold
on the board,

09:25.275 --> 09:26.724
but that's gonna end
pretty quick here.

09:26.758 --> 09:30.000
And so, we got bigger
equipment to be able
to move on to the cuts

09:30.034 --> 09:32.103
and I'm starting to feel
like a real miner out here.

09:34.482 --> 09:38.379
[narrator] Rick has less than
two weeks of pay left to run.

09:39.758 --> 09:43.379
If he's to hit his
thousand-ounce season goal,

09:43.413 --> 09:46.793
he needs big iron to return
for the treasures

09:46.827 --> 09:50.206
lying at the bottom of
the gold-rich Rally Valley.

09:52.965 --> 09:55.034
[Rick speaking]

10:05.241 --> 10:06.068
I gotta get outta here.

10:07.034 --> 10:08.586
Buzz can keep things going.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.896
[narrator]
Rick leaves Buzz Legault

10:12.931 --> 10:15.620
and Morgan Luren
to run operations...

10:17.965 --> 10:21.379
while he makes a four-hour
drive to Paradise Hill

10:21.413 --> 10:24.758
in the hopes of getting help
from a local friend.

10:27.241 --> 10:29.206
[Rick] Now I'm just gonna dip
into the people I know.

10:29.241 --> 10:31.655
First off,
I'm gonna go see Tony Beets.

10:31.689 --> 10:33.793
You know, Tony's got
tons of gear.

10:33.827 --> 10:36.241
Hopefully I can, uh, get some
equipment leased off with him.

10:36.275 --> 10:37.965
I put my mom's house
up for auction

10:38.000 --> 10:40.241
when she passed,
to get a little money.

10:40.275 --> 10:42.862
Priority number one is getting
back to getting gold

10:42.896 --> 10:45.620
and I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to do that.

10:45.655 --> 10:48.655
[tense music playing]

10:53.517 --> 10:54.413
[Tony speaking]

10:54.448 --> 10:55.241
[Rick] Good. Good.

11:00.413 --> 11:01.482
[Rick]
Feels good to be back, yes.

11:01.517 --> 11:02.965
[Tony speaking]

11:05.413 --> 11:07.344
Yeah. But, you know,
I had a lot of things

11:07.379 --> 11:09.827
in my head I had to clear up
and a lot of personal stuff

11:09.862 --> 11:11.931
and so, unfortunately,
it is what it is.

11:14.310 --> 11:15.241
[Minnie] That's right.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.103
I've been gone for a while
but, uh--

11:16.137 --> 11:17.137
[Tony speaking]

11:17.172 --> 11:18.137
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

11:18.172 --> 11:19.241
I feel good
about being up here.

11:19.275 --> 11:20.413
There's a piggy bank
out there,

11:20.448 --> 11:22.241
it's in the ground
with some gold.

11:22.275 --> 11:24.241
[Rick] It's ready to run
but, uh, you know,

11:24.275 --> 11:26.241
I am... You know, I got
no equipment to run with.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.793
[Tony speaking]

11:32.758 --> 11:34.344
[Rick] I figured
the easiest way

11:34.379 --> 11:35.896
would be to find the closest
stuff and, uh--

11:35.931 --> 11:39.034
[Tony speaking]

11:39.068 --> 11:40.034
Yeah.

11:40.068 --> 11:41.000
Yeah.

11:48.206 --> 11:50.275
Well, I'm looking, you know,

11:50.310 --> 11:54.172
for a 700 and two rock trucks.

11:55.931 --> 11:58.448
[tense music playing]

12:06.551 --> 12:07.793
[Minnie]
Well, we'll have to see.

12:07.827 --> 12:11.413
[Tony speaking]

12:30.862 --> 12:35.137
I'm looking, you know,
for a 700 and two rock trucks.

12:36.586 --> 12:39.965
[narrator] Rick Ness
desperately needs big iron

12:41.620 --> 12:43.586
and is hoping
to lease equipment

12:43.620 --> 12:46.551
from "King of the Klondike"
Tony Beets.

12:47.965 --> 12:49.620
I'm looking for anything
that's got some life in it

12:49.655 --> 12:50.793
-that I can get going.
-[Tony speaking]

12:52.896 --> 12:54.172
[Rick] And I am capable
of getting that gold

12:54.206 --> 12:55.724
outta the ground, so...

12:55.758 --> 12:57.000
I'm ready for it.

13:04.206 --> 13:07.344
Well, and we can't
short ourselves either.

13:08.965 --> 13:09.793
Absolutely.

13:09.827 --> 13:11.482
[Tony speaking]

13:11.517 --> 13:12.413
[Rick] Yeah. Exactly. Yup.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.000
Okay.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.620
That's all I can ask for.

13:24.689 --> 13:25.931
[Rick] Thanks again, Tony.

13:25.965 --> 13:27.413
[Tony speaking]

13:27.448 --> 13:28.275
-[Minnie] See you.
-See you soon. Yup.

13:31.862 --> 13:34.241
Yeah, it was good to see him.
I'm glad he's doing well.

13:34.275 --> 13:36.862
[Tony speaking]

13:38.172 --> 13:41.034
Well. I mean, honestly,
that went pretty good.

13:41.068 --> 13:42.655
I don't have any solid answers

13:42.689 --> 13:43.758
but, you know,
I can tell they wanna help me.

13:45.137 --> 13:47.310
But we're just gonna have
to wait and find out for now.

13:49.310 --> 13:52.344
[tense music playing]

14:01.068 --> 14:03.689
This is the Gold Rush,

14:03.724 --> 14:06.206
driving down Gold Rush Lane.

14:06.241 --> 14:08.758
How many people came here
with big dreams

14:08.793 --> 14:11.724
and how many people
got destroyed?

14:13.517 --> 14:14.965
[narrator]
Back in the Klondike,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.137
Fred Lewis and his wife Khara

14:17.172 --> 14:20.793
are on a mission to save
their gold-mining dream.

14:22.137 --> 14:24.310
[Fred] We just gotta figure
out how to keep mining.

14:24.344 --> 14:25.758
Like all we need is one break.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.241
I just wanna know
where the gold is.

14:30.034 --> 14:31.241
[man] Hey, Parker.

14:31.275 --> 14:32.344
Parker.

14:33.620 --> 14:34.896
Parker.

14:36.862 --> 14:38.827
[narrator]
A former Green Beret medic...

14:38.862 --> 14:40.000
-[Fred] Holy--
-[metal detector beeps]

14:40.034 --> 14:42.137
[narrator]
...Fred caught gold fever

14:42.172 --> 14:45.310
on prospecting expeditions
with Parker...

14:45.344 --> 14:46.413
That's pretty cool.

14:47.275 --> 14:48.724
It's really cool.

14:48.758 --> 14:52.724
[narrator] ...leading Fred to
join Parker's Klondike crew.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.137
[horn honks]

14:54.172 --> 14:56.172
-Oh, [bleep]!
-[Parker] Whoa!

14:56.206 --> 14:57.413
Easy, man!

14:59.344 --> 15:00.896
[narrator] A year later...

15:00.931 --> 15:02.034
[man] Order, huh!

15:02.068 --> 15:04.620
[Fred] I'm ready to call
in the troops.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.172
[narrator]
...the rookie gold miner

15:06.206 --> 15:08.344
took the gamble
of a lifetime...

15:08.379 --> 15:12.413
All right, guys,
it's go time! Let's do it!

15:12.448 --> 15:14.034
[narrator] ...to run
his own mine

15:14.068 --> 15:16.344
with a crew of veterans.

15:16.379 --> 15:17.517
Whoo! Let's get some gold!

15:17.551 --> 15:18.793
Whoo!

15:18.827 --> 15:21.344
[Fred] These guys have fought
so much adversity.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.172
My major focus here was to
give these guys a new purpose.

15:24.206 --> 15:27.172
[dramatic music playing]

15:29.965 --> 15:32.000
[narrator] But last season
in the Yukon...

15:33.172 --> 15:36.000
Right now,
we are in a war for gold.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.758
[narrator]
...Fred battled setback...

15:39.034 --> 15:41.000
What the [bleep]?

15:41.034 --> 15:43.275
Our entire claim is under ice.

15:45.034 --> 15:46.620
[narrator] ...after setback...

15:46.655 --> 15:48.206
[Fred] No, no, no, no, no!

15:57.137 --> 15:59.931
[narrator] ...leaving Fred's
dream of striking it rich

16:01.172 --> 16:03.241
hanging by a thread.

16:03.275 --> 16:04.827
[Fred] I'm just at the end
of my rope, man.

16:08.275 --> 16:12.103
The harsh reality is,
I don't see a high probability

16:12.137 --> 16:13.413
of us finding good gold.

16:14.586 --> 16:18.689
[Khara] You literally chose
the hardest area.

16:19.551 --> 16:20.965
Too much risk.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.620
[Fred] So you really are
leaning on pausing?

16:23.655 --> 16:24.689
[Khara] Yeah.

16:24.724 --> 16:26.896
We really need to start
focusing on prospecting.

16:26.931 --> 16:28.068
Yeah.

16:28.689 --> 16:29.689
[Fred] All right.

16:29.724 --> 16:31.068
Well, I've got a lead
to look at.

16:31.103 --> 16:34.379
The dude's name
is Peter Tallman.

16:34.413 --> 16:36.965
It's around
the El Dorado area.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.620
And it's one of the bigger
gold finds up here

16:38.655 --> 16:39.620
in the original gold rush.

16:42.172 --> 16:43.965
[narrator] In August 1896,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.448
prospectors found piles
of gold nuggets

16:47.482 --> 16:49.517
on El Dorado Creek.

16:51.482 --> 16:53.655
Since their discovery,

16:53.689 --> 16:58.068
miners have pulled out
over six million ounces,

16:58.103 --> 17:00.931
making El Dorado
one of the richest creeks

17:00.965 --> 17:02.034
in the Klondike.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.034
[Khara] Klondike Gold Corp.

17:08.275 --> 17:10.205
-Hey there.
-Welcome to El Dorado.

17:10.241 --> 17:11.000
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

17:12.310 --> 17:15.103
[Peter] There's just amazing,
rich amount of history

17:15.137 --> 17:17.586
that informs where gold is.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.827
My company has been here
for 45 years

17:20.862 --> 17:24.137
looking for the bedrock
sources of all the gold.

17:24.172 --> 17:25.931
We've been successful on that.

17:25.964 --> 17:28.724
And that informs
some of the plaster potential.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.793
Plaster is exactly
what we're looking for.

17:30.827 --> 17:33.758
Something we can do
on a small operation.

17:33.793 --> 17:36.137
We're looking to pull
300 to 500 ounces a year.

17:36.172 --> 17:38.896
-To be sustainable and...
-And sustainability.

17:38.931 --> 17:40.758
We were told to talk to you.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.137
Well then, whoever told you
that was right.

17:43.172 --> 17:44.551
-[laughs]
-[Peter] All right.

17:46.827 --> 17:50.000
[narrator] Geologist and claim
owner Peter Tallman

17:50.034 --> 17:52.827
has 21 square miles of land.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.586
[Peter]
The opportunity for you

17:55.620 --> 17:59.034
is basically the last un-mined
gold on El Dorado Creek,

17:59.068 --> 18:01.137
the richest in the Klondike
by a long way.

18:01.172 --> 18:02.689
-It's pretty crazy.
-All right. I like that sound.

18:02.724 --> 18:04.137
I've got a ten-year permit.

18:04.172 --> 18:06.344
-Um, so it's available.
-All right.

18:06.379 --> 18:09.413
[Peter] All these diamonds
are gold in bedrock.

18:09.448 --> 18:11.724
And it's suggesting strongly

18:11.758 --> 18:14.275
that the gold is being derived
from the local bedrock,

18:14.310 --> 18:16.586
and it's just shedding
down the creek.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.241
There's the opportunity to do

18:19.275 --> 18:21.793
basically 500 ounces-plus
a year

18:22.482 --> 18:25.241
-for a good bit.
-Wow.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.827
[Fred] Heck, yeah.
We're excited
to see all of it.

18:26.862 --> 18:27.689
[Khara] Yeah.

18:28.793 --> 18:30.931
[narrator]
Ten miles from Dawson City

18:30.965 --> 18:33.655
lies the historic
El Dorado Creek.

18:36.137 --> 18:40.275
All of Peter's claims
on this section of El Dorado

18:40.310 --> 18:42.310
are mined out.

18:42.344 --> 18:45.310
But on the Chief
Gulch Tributary,

18:45.344 --> 18:48.206
he has 320 acres of untouched

18:48.241 --> 18:50.034
virgin ground available.

18:55.655 --> 18:57.379
[Peter] Welcome to El Dorado.

18:59.862 --> 19:01.655
[narrator]
Peter first shows them

19:01.689 --> 19:04.172
the already-mined
section of land.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.413
[Peter] It was a mom-and-pop,
very small family operation.

19:09.448 --> 19:12.000
Mined this section
and they got 501 ounces

19:12.034 --> 19:13.344
in 500 hours.

19:13.379 --> 19:14.379
Whoa.

19:14.413 --> 19:17.000
So are they using
rock truck excavator,

19:17.034 --> 19:18.827
just doing simple
mining techniques,

19:18.862 --> 19:20.172
is that working for them?

19:20.206 --> 19:21.827
[Peter] That's what's
necessary here.

19:21.862 --> 19:23.551
You could have
a fleet of rock trucks,

19:23.586 --> 19:25.551
and all of them but one would
be parked somewhere.

19:25.586 --> 19:26.724
[laughs]

19:26.758 --> 19:28.724
And there's literally
only room for one rock truck.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.379
I'm feeling like
this is a good fit,

19:30.413 --> 19:31.965
-without seeing gold.
-[Khara] Yeah.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.586
Well, okay. You mentioned

19:33.620 --> 19:34.551
"without seeing gold."

19:34.586 --> 19:37.689
So, hah, once you mine it,

19:37.724 --> 19:39.896
and then you fire it...

19:39.931 --> 19:42.448
-Oh.
-...then you turn it

19:42.482 --> 19:45.551
-into gold dore bars.
-[Khara] Oh.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.655
[Peter] And this...

19:47.689 --> 19:48.896
-[Fred] Whoa.
-[Khara] What?

19:48.931 --> 19:50.551
-[Peter] ...comes from here.
-Really?

19:50.586 --> 19:52.310
-[Peter] Yeah.
-[Khara] Oh, my gosh.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.931
-Wow.
-[Fred] Can I hold it?

19:53.965 --> 19:55.620
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Fred laughs]

19:55.655 --> 19:57.103
[Peter] It's 35 ounces.

19:57.137 --> 19:59.655
And you're trying to make
a decision of where to go,

19:59.689 --> 20:01.862
what to do,
and where to find it.

20:01.896 --> 20:02.862
[Khara] Oh, that's heavy.

20:02.896 --> 20:04.482
[Peter] I'm just telling you,
it's here.

20:04.517 --> 20:06.275
-It's here.
-Wow.

20:06.310 --> 20:08.310
[Fred]
Is there new gold coming in?

20:08.344 --> 20:09.793
Is it being recycled?

20:09.827 --> 20:11.103
Is there just lots
that's been found?

20:12.068 --> 20:13.931
-All of it?
-[Peter] All of those.

20:13.965 --> 20:16.206
It's being eroded from source

20:16.241 --> 20:19.586
and still populating
the creeks today.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.551
But there's lots of ground

20:21.586 --> 20:24.275
that still has yet
to be mined at any time,

20:24.310 --> 20:26.103
and that's what
I'm gonna go show you.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.827
The untouched claim.

20:27.862 --> 20:29.172
[Fred] This is the first time
I've actually kind of felt

20:29.206 --> 20:30.275
a little gold fever.

20:30.310 --> 20:31.689
-[Khara] Mm-hmm.
-I wanna see what's next.

20:33.448 --> 20:36.310
[Peter] I have the drill map
if you wanna see them,

20:36.344 --> 20:40.448
but that was successful,
unbelievably so,

20:40.482 --> 20:42.379
in that...
there's a bunch of holes

20:42.413 --> 20:45.551
that hit really,
really good gold.

20:45.586 --> 20:47.827
And it proves
there's a channel in here.

20:47.862 --> 20:48.689
[Fred] Yeah.

20:53.068 --> 20:54.344
Holy crap.

20:55.965 --> 20:58.068
This looks amazing.

20:58.103 --> 21:00.275
The challenge in here
is that it's a slot canyon.

21:00.310 --> 21:02.689
[Fred] This is very similar
to California Creek,

21:02.724 --> 21:03.931
in the narrowness.

21:03.965 --> 21:06.724
It's not something that's
gonna scare us away, for sure.

21:06.758 --> 21:08.275
I guess the important
question would be

21:08.310 --> 21:09.758
what's the average depth here

21:09.793 --> 21:11.034
before you actually see
pay gravel?

21:11.068 --> 21:12.896
-30 to 40 feet.
-Whew.

21:12.931 --> 21:15.551
Random places,
60 feet down on the bottom.

21:15.586 --> 21:16.586
[Fred] Oh.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.896
[Peter] It's gonna take
quite a bit of time,

21:18.931 --> 21:21.758
you know.
If you came here this year,

21:21.793 --> 21:24.655
then your gold will be coming
next year, for sure.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.344
[dramatic music playing]

21:28.379 --> 21:29.586
So I think for us,

21:29.620 --> 21:31.137
the one thing is how long
it's gonna take us

21:31.172 --> 21:32.655
to actually get gold,

21:32.689 --> 21:35.965
because if we can't get gold
coming in within two months,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.206
we're gonna run out of money.
And the second is the depth.

21:38.241 --> 21:40.586
I don't think we've ever dug
60 feet before.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.034
It's very deep.

21:42.068 --> 21:46.206
So for those reasons,
I think we can't mine here,

21:46.793 --> 21:47.862
unfortunately.

21:49.551 --> 21:50.655
That's fair enough.

21:50.689 --> 21:53.551
I... That... Yeah,
I appreciate the candor

21:53.586 --> 21:55.793
because it's just easier
for everyone.

22:02.758 --> 22:03.758
[Fred] Strike one.

22:04.965 --> 22:07.620
I mean, really,
right now we're looking at

22:07.655 --> 22:09.379
very little options
to move forward.

22:11.137 --> 22:12.827
Yeah.

22:12.862 --> 22:14.482
I'm gonna have to find
something else

22:14.517 --> 22:16.586
or we're getting pretty close
to the end here.

22:17.689 --> 22:18.862
We're gonna have
to do something.

22:18.896 --> 22:20.137
Figure something out.

22:21.896 --> 22:22.862
Yeah.

22:22.896 --> 22:24.793
I'm not going down
without a fight.

22:34.551 --> 22:37.275
[dramatic music playing]

22:38.206 --> 22:40.758
It's time
to make all this stuff

22:40.793 --> 22:42.068
scattered across the cut

22:42.103 --> 22:44.068
look like a wash plant.

22:45.379 --> 22:48.827
[narrator] Parker Schnabel
is running out of cash

22:50.344 --> 22:53.827
and desperately needs gold
by the end of the week.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.241
It's good to finally be
pretty close to sluicing.

22:59.275 --> 23:00.482
It's been a long time.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.931
We need some money.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.068
Hopefully, it's a decent setup
and everything runs smooth.

23:09.172 --> 23:11.482
[narrator]
Parker's charged Tyson Lee

23:11.517 --> 23:14.586
with getting wash plant
Sluicifer up and running

23:14.620 --> 23:17.551
at Ken and Stuart's
Unforgiven cut.

23:22.241 --> 23:26.482
[narrator] Tyson's crew
must drag the monster
150 yards

23:26.517 --> 23:30.482
to the top of a 45-foot high
wash plant pad...

23:32.068 --> 23:34.379
swivel it 90 degrees,

23:36.137 --> 23:39.068
bring in the hopper feeder
and conveyors...

23:41.137 --> 23:44.896
then, fire up for the first
run of the season.

23:46.620 --> 23:49.137
Finishing moves here, Tyson,
then you can drag it.

23:49.172 --> 23:51.724
Hey. It's only taken
all season.

23:51.758 --> 23:52.827
Let's go.

23:54.758 --> 23:57.034
[Tyson] Today's
a really big day.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.586
I'm gonna drag Sluicifer
to her first home of
the season.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.413
So we just gotta focus

24:02.448 --> 24:04.275
on getting her up there
in one piece.

24:06.448 --> 24:08.793
You know,
we're starting our incline

24:08.827 --> 24:10.275
up to Sluicifer's
wash plant pad

24:10.310 --> 24:11.551
and it's pretty steep.

24:13.758 --> 24:16.103
[narrator]
Using the 750 excavator,

24:16.137 --> 24:18.965
Tyson must haul
the fully-assembled plant

24:19.000 --> 24:21.517
up a 25-degree incline

24:21.551 --> 24:23.551
to get it onto the pad.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.413
[Parker] Tyson loves
pitting his wash plants

24:26.448 --> 24:28.034
on a big old mountain.

24:29.448 --> 24:30.793
We're almost up top.

24:34.793 --> 24:36.344
[Tyson] Beautiful.

24:36.379 --> 24:37.689
We're up top,
we're on the pad.

24:38.655 --> 24:40.448
We're coming up
on the hardest part here,

24:40.482 --> 24:42.862
and that's gonna be
spinning the plant 90 degrees,

24:42.896 --> 24:44.344
and so our tailings

24:44.379 --> 24:46.206
are going the way
we want them to.

24:49.379 --> 24:51.862
There isn't much room
for error.

24:54.310 --> 24:56.655
I'm starting
to kind of go down...

24:57.862 --> 25:02.137
the slope behind me backwards
with the plant attached.

25:02.172 --> 25:04.862
We're gonna pull
the plant straight back,

25:04.896 --> 25:06.482
and then
I'm gonna spin around

25:06.517 --> 25:08.172
-and pull it square.
-[Parker speaking]

25:13.241 --> 25:15.000
[Mike] Things are getting
a little bit sketchy.

25:15.034 --> 25:17.310
Got a 75-ton excavator,

25:17.344 --> 25:19.551
you got 80 tons here,

25:19.586 --> 25:22.034
and we got these
two cables here.

25:22.068 --> 25:23.344
If these cables snap,

25:24.103 --> 25:25.965
basically he's gonna tumble,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.206
and hopefully this thing
doesn't come down on him.

25:29.241 --> 25:31.413
You just don't want
those cables snapping.

25:35.344 --> 25:37.275
[Tyson] Someone keeping
their eyes up there?

25:37.310 --> 25:38.793
[Mike] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:39.241 --> 25:40.413
Watch the angles!

25:45.241 --> 25:46.275
Back up!

25:48.068 --> 25:48.931
Keep going.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.344
Stop!

25:53.482 --> 25:55.068
Looking good, Tyson!

25:56.103 --> 25:57.758
Whoo!

25:57.793 --> 25:59.655
[Tyson] Sluicifer's finally
at her new home.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.172
I'm really excited
to start washing some rocks

26:02.206 --> 26:04.000
and hopefully catching
a lot of gold.

26:06.655 --> 26:09.586
[narrator] All that's left
is to hook up the generator

26:09.620 --> 26:11.413
to the Super Stacker.

26:11.448 --> 26:14.655
[Tyson] Start, start,
start, start.

26:14.689 --> 26:18.068
[narrator] The extendable
53-foot-long conveyor

26:18.103 --> 26:20.862
feeds paydirt to the plant.

26:20.896 --> 26:23.344
[Tyson] We have power
but no controls.

26:23.379 --> 26:25.482
Yeah, we got nothing.

26:26.896 --> 26:29.137
[Alec]
Okay. I'll be down there.

26:31.931 --> 26:33.413
[Tyson] What do you got, Alec?

26:33.448 --> 26:35.896
[Alec] We don't have
hydraulic function,

26:35.931 --> 26:37.586
nor conveyor belt function,

26:37.620 --> 26:39.000
but the computer
does light up,

26:39.034 --> 26:41.103
so it does have some
sort of power through here.

26:41.931 --> 26:43.517
-[machine clicks]
-Oh!

26:43.551 --> 26:45.000
[Alec] She just gotta wake up
a little bit, eh?

26:45.655 --> 26:47.137
[Tyson] Away she goes.

26:47.172 --> 26:49.620
We'll just pretend
that never happened.

26:49.655 --> 26:51.862
[Mike] If that didn't fire up,
we were done.

26:56.620 --> 27:00.275
I have the plant set
to max capacity here.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.551
And it's time we play
some serious catch-up.

27:03.103 --> 27:04.413
Here we go.

27:11.586 --> 27:12.931
[Tyson] Go ahead.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.413
Give her the first scoop.

27:18.896 --> 27:20.620
[Tatiana] Yay!

27:24.551 --> 27:26.344
[Tyson] So there we go,
we got Sluicifer running,

27:26.379 --> 27:27.896
Tatiana's feeding,

27:27.931 --> 27:29.931
latest we've ever
started sluicing.

27:29.965 --> 27:31.586
We have a lot
of gold to catch,

27:31.620 --> 27:33.517
and really
the season starts today.

27:35.206 --> 27:37.275
[narrator] Nearly seven weeks
into the season,

27:37.931 --> 27:40.068
later than ever before,

27:40.103 --> 27:43.827
Parker is finally
on the gold.

27:44.172 --> 27:45.241
Nice job.

27:45.275 --> 27:46.517
It looks good.

27:48.827 --> 27:50.206
-[Tyson] Good day?
-[Parker] Yeah.

27:50.241 --> 27:51.758
Well, we're finally
making money.

27:51.793 --> 27:54.068
Lot of catch-up
on that front to do.

27:58.758 --> 28:00.310
End of the week,
we'll see if there's any gold

28:00.344 --> 28:02.137
in this claim.

28:02.172 --> 28:03.689
[Tyson] We'll find out
soon enough.

28:04.344 --> 28:05.206
See you around.

28:06.344 --> 28:08.482
[sighs]

28:08.517 --> 28:10.586
[Parker] I hope it's good.
We need it to be good.

28:13.965 --> 28:15.172
We've spent a lot of money.

28:22.172 --> 28:25.103
[dramatic music playing]

28:36.517 --> 28:39.103
This is some
freaking big iron, man.

28:39.689 --> 28:40.793
Hell yeah.

28:42.862 --> 28:44.172
[chuckles] That's awesome.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.206
Tony's come through,
which is a game-changer.

28:48.241 --> 28:51.206
We got a 700
and two rock trucks.

28:51.241 --> 28:52.379
That's[bleep] perfect.

28:53.965 --> 28:57.655
[narrator] Rick Ness has dug
into his emergency fund

28:57.689 --> 29:00.655
to lease heavy equipment
from Tony Beets,

29:02.172 --> 29:04.896
delivered by local hauler
Derek Mamic.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.482
There you go, Ricky.

29:08.517 --> 29:10.275
[bleep] hey, dude.

29:10.310 --> 29:11.931
-Appreciate it.
-Finally got her.

29:11.965 --> 29:14.517
Oh, that's... It's just good
to see it on site.

29:14.551 --> 29:16.275
[Derek] Yeah, got hit
with the rain,

29:16.310 --> 29:18.517
which is kind of [bleep]
because we had to
walk it so far.

29:18.551 --> 29:19.862
[Rick] That's springtime
in the Yukon.

29:19.896 --> 29:21.379
[Derek] And now, you can go
to work and make some money.

29:21.413 --> 29:22.448
[Rick] [bleep] yeah.

29:22.482 --> 29:23.586
We're off to the races.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.620
[bleep] yeah.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.793
[narrator]
The new powerful equipment

29:31.827 --> 29:33.448
will ramp up production

29:33.482 --> 29:37.448
and help Rick hit
his 1,000-ounce season goal.

29:39.275 --> 29:41.724
Well, coming back this year,
this is more what I pictured,
you know what I mean?

29:41.758 --> 29:43.862
Big excavators, big machines.

29:45.482 --> 29:46.896
This is what we need
to get[bleep] done

29:46.931 --> 29:48.000
right here, a 700.

29:49.586 --> 29:52.413
[narrator] As Rick chases
his 20-ounce weekly target

29:52.448 --> 29:55.068
from his leftover
stockpile pay...

29:56.000 --> 29:57.344
This is the real deal
here now.

29:58.551 --> 30:01.000
[narrator] ...camp cook
Travis Kinakin

30:01.034 --> 30:03.000
in Rick's old haul truck

30:03.034 --> 30:05.551
and Buzz Legault
in the loader,

30:05.586 --> 30:07.965
repair the road
into the mine.

30:09.310 --> 30:10.896
That 700 with the big tracks

30:10.931 --> 30:13.517
just chewed the [bleep]
out of this road.

30:13.551 --> 30:16.448
So Buzz and I are out here
fixing the holes.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.620
I'm dumping some gravel.

30:17.655 --> 30:19.551
Buzz is gonna level them out.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.896
[Travis] Oh, [bleep].

30:34.931 --> 30:36.137
[bleep]

30:37.413 --> 30:38.551
[groans]

30:39.068 --> 30:40.241
[bleep]

30:41.758 --> 30:42.758
Holy [bleep].

30:48.586 --> 30:49.758
[Travis] Yeah, I'm okay.

30:50.827 --> 30:52.241
Hopefully the truck's okay.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.413
[bleep]

30:56.344 --> 30:58.448
She's looking
pretty [bleep] stuck.

31:00.310 --> 31:02.103
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna get it out of here.

31:03.379 --> 31:05.000
[bleep]

31:11.172 --> 31:14.137
[dramatic music playing]

31:16.275 --> 31:19.034
[Travis] She's looking
pretty [bleep] stuck.

31:19.068 --> 31:20.896
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna get it outta here.

31:20.931 --> 31:23.275
[bleep]

31:23.310 --> 31:25.793
[narrator] Camp cook
Travis Kinakin

31:25.827 --> 31:28.517
has ditched
Rick's old haul truck.

31:28.551 --> 31:32.241
It's hanging
over a 30-foot sheer drop.

31:33.965 --> 31:35.482
[Travis] Rick, you got a copy?

31:36.103 --> 31:37.758
Yeah. Go for Rick.

31:37.793 --> 31:39.482
[Travis] I'm just
down on the...

31:39.517 --> 31:41.103
on the road down to the cut

31:41.137 --> 31:43.758
and the shoulder
just gave way on the road.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.827
So the truck's...

31:45.862 --> 31:47.827
almost on its side down
in the ditch.

31:48.862 --> 31:50.931
[Rick] For[bleep] sake.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.931
Look, man, I gotta keep
running the wash plant,

31:52.965 --> 31:55.206
so you guys are gonna have
to come get this 700 from me.

31:55.241 --> 31:57.172
That's the only thing that's
gonna lift it out of there.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.793
I gotta keep
the gold coming in.

32:00.965 --> 32:02.275
[bleep] stupid.

32:04.689 --> 32:05.896
Yeah. Rick's not happy.

32:06.896 --> 32:08.551
Oh, [bleep].

32:08.586 --> 32:11.310
[narrator] Rick keeps running
wash plant Monster Red

32:11.344 --> 32:12.827
in the old 330.

32:16.793 --> 32:18.758
And Derek,
who delivered the iron,

32:18.793 --> 32:21.655
takes the 700
to the stricken truck.

32:23.827 --> 32:25.655
It's gonna take a good pull.

32:25.689 --> 32:27.689
Uh, it's a...
it's a big truck.

32:35.586 --> 32:38.068
Buzz, how can we get
that rock truck out?

32:38.103 --> 32:39.655
We can freaking get
over there,

32:39.689 --> 32:41.689
grab the back end
with the hoe

32:41.724 --> 32:43.379
so it doesn't roll
or anything.

32:43.413 --> 32:46.482
We'll hook that loader up
to the front low corner.

32:46.517 --> 32:48.275
Working together,
I think we should be able

32:48.310 --> 32:50.000
to get that puppy out.

32:50.034 --> 32:51.551
Now that
it's freaking raining, man,

32:51.586 --> 32:52.896
it's only gonna get worse,
right?

32:52.931 --> 32:55.206
So let's get
this [bleep] done.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.586
-[Buzz] Yeah.
-[Travis] Let's do it.

32:56.620 --> 32:57.551
Let's go.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.068
[Travis] Well, I'm gonna jump
in the... in the haul truck.

33:05.103 --> 33:06.862
The excavator
is gonna stabilize it,

33:06.896 --> 33:09.137
so hopefully it doesn't roll.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.241
We're gonna pull it out
with the loader,

33:11.275 --> 33:15.344
and I'm going to drive it out
the best I can,

33:15.379 --> 33:17.000
pray that it doesn't roll.

33:20.344 --> 33:22.103
[Derek] Hey, Buzz, right here.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.482
Just push straight down
on that poplar.

33:25.517 --> 33:26.655
Yeah. Straight down.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.827
Come in a bit.

33:35.275 --> 33:36.965
[Travis] This thing keeps--
It's...

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It's on the verge
of rolling now.

33:39.689 --> 33:40.862
Just try not even to spin.

33:40.896 --> 33:42.586
Just a little bit of power.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.827
[suspenseful music playing]

33:54.448 --> 33:56.379
[bleep] yeah. Let's go, boys!

33:58.620 --> 33:59.896
Good job.

34:03.758 --> 34:05.931
[Derek] Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

34:06.862 --> 34:09.655
Hey, stay off
the [bleep] shoulder.

34:09.688 --> 34:12.447
[laughs]

34:14.793 --> 34:16.655
We ended up pretty lucky.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.275
We would've never
got that truck out

34:18.310 --> 34:20.275
without this 700.

34:20.310 --> 34:21.896
This freaking thing
is awesome.

34:24.516 --> 34:26.172
[Rick] I'm glad to hear
that Buzz got Travis free.

34:26.206 --> 34:27.172
Hopefully, he's okay.

34:27.206 --> 34:28.516
And hopefully
with this new equipment,

34:28.551 --> 34:29.551
we won't have accidents
like that

34:29.585 --> 34:31.137
and we can just focus
on getting the gold.

34:34.862 --> 34:37.379
[dramatic music playing]

34:39.447 --> 34:42.379
[acoustic music playing]

34:45.655 --> 34:47.068
[Khara] After seeing some
of the things we've seen

34:47.103 --> 34:48.482
since we've been up here,

34:48.516 --> 34:51.551
I was really hoping that
we would have more clarity.

34:51.585 --> 34:52.862
I thought for sure
going into El Dorado,

34:52.896 --> 34:54.551
I'm like,
"This is gonna be it."

34:54.585 --> 34:56.447
But it's just more obstacles,
more challenges.

34:58.172 --> 34:59.241
[Fred] I don't know, Khara.

34:59.275 --> 35:01.896
I feel like we've put
our best effort into this,

35:01.931 --> 35:05.620
and I'm running out of time
to pull it off this time.

35:06.862 --> 35:09.689
[narrator] Fred Lewis
is nearly out of time

35:09.724 --> 35:13.482
to save
his gold mining dream.

35:13.517 --> 35:15.827
-[Fred] So, you know...
-Mm-hmm.

35:15.862 --> 35:17.655
We're gonna have
to go talk to Parker.

35:17.689 --> 35:19.206
[Khara] Yeah. I agree.

35:19.241 --> 35:20.862
[Fred] Maybe he has some
advice that might help us.

35:20.896 --> 35:21.931
Who knows?

35:23.517 --> 35:25.103
I just don't want this
to end, you know?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.068
-Hey, Parker.
-[Parker] Fred. How you doing?

35:33.103 --> 35:35.034
-[Fred] How's it going, man?
-Good. Good to see you.

35:37.655 --> 35:39.000
Here. Have a seat, babe.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.379
[Parker] How you been?

35:43.413 --> 35:45.413
You know last season
wasn't very good.

35:45.448 --> 35:47.413
We're prospecting right now,
looking for ground.

35:47.448 --> 35:49.931
We just looked at some ground
over on El Dorado.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.000
Nothing's matching up
to what we need.

35:54.034 --> 35:55.931
But just...
You know, I came to you,

35:55.965 --> 35:57.551
you've got me into all this.

35:57.586 --> 35:58.931
You've taught me so much.
You've brought me

35:58.965 --> 36:00.758
-all over the world.
-Yeah. Is that a good
or a bad thing now?

36:00.793 --> 36:02.241
[laughing]

36:02.965 --> 36:06.137
Um, I just can't bow out

36:06.172 --> 36:08.000
before I come and talk to you.

36:08.034 --> 36:11.206
Right. Well, I'm sorry
that that's the way it went.

36:11.241 --> 36:12.655
You know? That's a bummer.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.724
-Yup.
-I... don't know

36:16.758 --> 36:18.862
if you're here asking
for ground,

36:18.896 --> 36:21.827
because it's getting harder
and harder out here.

36:21.862 --> 36:23.241
So it doesn't
really make sense for us

36:23.275 --> 36:24.827
-to lease ground out.
-[Fred] Yup.

36:24.862 --> 36:26.655
[Parker] Anything big,
we're gonna take on, right?

36:26.689 --> 36:28.689
Yup. Yup.

36:28.724 --> 36:30.068
Yeah. I guess
I'm more coming here

36:30.103 --> 36:31.551
just to kind of see
what you think

36:31.586 --> 36:34.172
is our best move, honestly.

36:34.206 --> 36:37.172
Well, if you can't find
economical ground

36:37.206 --> 36:38.793
and that's not working,

36:38.827 --> 36:40.379
it doesn't make sense
to beat your head

36:40.413 --> 36:42.310
-against the wall, right?
-No, that's the thing,

36:42.344 --> 36:44.793
is gold mining
is something I really enjoy.

36:44.827 --> 36:47.758
I wouldn't say we're quitting,
but we're definitely...

36:47.793 --> 36:49.137
-holding on.
-We're gonna hit pause.

36:51.241 --> 36:52.413
Um...

36:54.241 --> 36:56.103
So if you've got a job
in, like, three weeks,

36:56.137 --> 36:57.310
maybe I'll hit you up.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.206
I'm pretty good
on a rock truck.

37:00.241 --> 37:03.689
Pretty good on an excavator.
[chuckles]

37:03.724 --> 37:06.103
Do you really wanna sit
in a dump truck?

37:06.137 --> 37:08.586
At this point,
I'd think about it.

37:08.620 --> 37:12.344
[dramatic music playing]

37:12.379 --> 37:15.482
Um, well, it's a bit
of a challenge on that front.

37:15.517 --> 37:17.655
We've got a pretty
decent-sized crew right now,

37:17.689 --> 37:20.137
and it's a little bit too much
than we should have as it is.

37:21.896 --> 37:25.206
But that always seems
to be the way.

37:25.241 --> 37:28.275
[sighs] Well,
that's pretty much why
we wanted to come, Parker.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.034
I just... I don't know.

37:30.068 --> 37:31.896
I kind of feel like
this is the place to end it,

37:31.931 --> 37:33.206
in some ways.

37:33.241 --> 37:34.620
I mean, you brought me
into this.

37:34.655 --> 37:36.655
Kind of full circle, I guess.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.241
[Parker] Um...
It's a brutal business

37:39.275 --> 37:42.344
and it just doesn't seem to
take any prisoners, does it?

37:42.379 --> 37:44.068
-[Khara laughs]
-[Fred] No, it does not.

37:44.103 --> 37:46.689
[sighs] Well, thank you
for the opportunity.

37:46.724 --> 37:47.965
I feel like I owe you a lot.

37:49.931 --> 37:53.517
Um, I appreciate
what you said there

37:53.551 --> 37:56.172
and I'm glad that, uh...

37:57.068 --> 37:58.793
we can leave on good terms.

37:58.827 --> 38:00.482
-[Fred] Yeah. Absolutely.
-[Parker] Yeah.

38:00.517 --> 38:02.931
-I appreciate it, Parker.
-[Parker] No worries.

38:02.965 --> 38:04.793
-Thanks for stopping in.
-[Fred] Thanks for having me.

38:04.827 --> 38:06.862
Sorry it went...
Sorry it went the way it did.

38:06.896 --> 38:08.379
[Fred] Hey, man. It's life.
It's life.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.482
-Take care, Parker.
-All right.

38:10.517 --> 38:13.068
[dramatic music playing]

38:16.068 --> 38:17.586
[sighs]

38:19.206 --> 38:20.758
[Parker] I don't like
to see somebody fail.

38:20.793 --> 38:22.827
Um, yeah.

38:22.862 --> 38:24.413
I mean, it's very tough

38:24.448 --> 38:26.586
to walk away from something

38:26.620 --> 38:28.689
that you've invested
that much time into,

38:28.724 --> 38:30.931
but it's just a bit awkward
for me.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.517
Like, he asked for a job.

38:34.482 --> 38:35.482
Mmm.

38:38.172 --> 38:39.275
[sighs]

38:41.586 --> 38:42.896
Yeah. Too bad.

38:44.793 --> 38:46.448
[Fred groans]

38:46.482 --> 38:48.344
[Fred] You know,
I feel like[bleep].

38:48.379 --> 38:49.482
I feel like...

38:50.724 --> 38:52.724
It's kind of the first time
I've been forced

38:52.758 --> 38:54.103
to give something up.

38:54.137 --> 38:56.241
My heart of hearts
is telling me

38:56.275 --> 38:59.310
to say goodbye to the Yukon.

38:59.344 --> 39:01.413
Regardless of where
we go from here,

39:01.448 --> 39:04.206
think about
what you've accomplished
over the last several years.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.000
Goal is never
to get rich off of gold.

39:06.034 --> 39:07.896
Our goal was to get that

39:07.931 --> 39:10.241
sense of purpose
and new mission,

39:10.275 --> 39:11.827
and that's exactly
what you accomplished.

39:11.862 --> 39:14.413
Yeah, I agree. I agree.

39:14.448 --> 39:16.965
We came into an industry
that's nearly impossible

39:17.000 --> 39:19.137
-to get into.
-[Khara] Yeah.

39:19.172 --> 39:20.793
[Fred] We've had some
really good highs,

39:20.827 --> 39:22.000
some really bad lows,

39:22.034 --> 39:23.965
and the point is we're down
but not out.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.103
That's it.

39:25.137 --> 39:28.172
[dramatic music playing]

39:34.103 --> 39:36.482
[Rick] At the moment,
I'm looking for new people.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.620
Tough to find workers.

39:39.965 --> 39:42.655
[narrator] Now that Rick
has more equipment,

39:42.689 --> 39:45.068
he's on the hunt
for more crew

39:45.103 --> 39:48.137
to make his next big push
for gold.

39:49.241 --> 39:50.620
I'm looking through resumes

39:50.655 --> 39:53.827
and half of them
are just full of abbreviations

39:53.862 --> 39:56.517
and... CLD for could.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.793
And he uses that word,
like, five times

39:58.827 --> 40:00.724
in this short letter.

40:00.758 --> 40:03.137
"I am heavy
equipment operator.

40:03.172 --> 40:04.793
I run FEL

40:04.827 --> 40:07.551
and NEOCT."

40:07.586 --> 40:09.137
I don't know what that is.

40:09.172 --> 40:11.965
Um, "TTYS," he ends it with.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.344
[laughing]

40:14.379 --> 40:16.931
"TTYS." You got it, bro.

40:16.965 --> 40:18.068
You're hired.

40:18.586 --> 40:19.931
Oh, my [bleep].

40:25.310 --> 40:28.103
[dramatic music playing]

40:29.413 --> 40:30.517
[Bailey] Oh, hey.

40:30.551 --> 40:31.827
[Rick] Are you guys hiding
from me out here?

40:31.862 --> 40:33.206
It's the only shady part

40:33.241 --> 40:34.275
on the entire claim.

40:35.896 --> 40:37.827
[narrator] Rick has had
two days running

40:37.862 --> 40:39.275
with his new equipment.

40:41.517 --> 40:43.310
[Rick] Man, I tell you.
For some reason,

40:43.344 --> 40:45.482
I've had a really good rapport
with Tony Beets.

40:45.517 --> 40:46.965
I think it's just 'cause
I don't bull[bleep] him.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.620
And he doesn't bull[bleep] me.
You know what I mean?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.000
So, it was nice
to score a couple

40:50.034 --> 40:51.724
of pieces of equipment
off of him.

40:51.758 --> 40:54.000
That 700,
that's [bleep] awesome.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.620
-I love that [bleep] thing.
-[all laughing]

40:56.655 --> 40:58.551
Oh, yeah. But...

40:58.586 --> 41:00.413
that all costs money as well,
you know what I mean?

41:00.448 --> 41:01.758
We gotta produce
more gold now.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.655
Bigger machines,
bigger fuel bills.

41:03.689 --> 41:05.862
-Yeah.
-Let's weigh some gold.

41:05.896 --> 41:07.448
[Bailey] Yes. Let's do it.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.206
[narrator] To cover costs

41:11.241 --> 41:13.482
and earn enough
to keep going,

41:13.517 --> 41:16.448
Rick needs to hit
20 ounces a week.

41:17.551 --> 41:18.620
[Rick] All right. Here we go.

41:25.965 --> 41:28.793
[Buzz] Nine, ten, 11, 12,

41:28.827 --> 41:32.413
15, 16, 17, 18...

41:35.241 --> 41:37.344
18.39.

41:38.241 --> 41:41.482
[narrator] Worth $37,000.

41:42.068 --> 41:43.344
Better than last week.

41:43.379 --> 41:44.793
Yup. Not the best ever.

41:45.793 --> 41:49.413
That brings us
to 95.93 ounces.

41:49.448 --> 41:51.344
-Nice.
-[Rick] Only a tenth
of the way

41:51.379 --> 41:52.827
to a thousand ounces.

41:52.862 --> 41:55.137
[Bailey] Yeah, but reality is
we finally have equipment.

41:55.172 --> 41:56.827
-So...
-[Rick] Yeah.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.241
[Bailey] I think
it'll start piling up.

41:59.931 --> 42:01.896
[Rick] That's over 30 grand
for the week.

42:01.931 --> 42:03.241
It's not bad.

42:03.275 --> 42:05.172
We've definitely gotta keep up
in the gold take.

42:05.206 --> 42:07.620
You know, 700 and those trucks
are definitely gonna help us.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.862
-[Bailey] Mm-hmm.
-We'll start adding
some more people.

42:09.896 --> 42:12.034
You know, we've got big things
to do this year, so...

42:12.068 --> 42:13.517
-[Bailey] Mm-hmm.
-[Buzz] Yeah.

42:13.551 --> 42:15.068
Let's get the [bleep]
out of here.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.620
Little over 18 ounces.

42:20.655 --> 42:23.137
Not great but we are building
towards something bigger.

42:23.172 --> 42:25.620
You know, we got a thousand
ounces to get this season.

42:25.655 --> 42:28.206
[sighs] We're gonna make it.
It's just slow right now.

42:32.862 --> 42:35.620
[dramatic music playing]

42:39.275 --> 42:41.275
[narrator] Parker's
wash plant Sluicifer

42:41.310 --> 42:44.241
has been running
the Unforgiven cut paydirt

42:44.275 --> 42:45.655
for two days.

42:47.482 --> 42:51.448
Now, the season's first
real gold is in.

42:54.517 --> 42:57.068
-What's up man?
-[Chris] Hey, man,
what's shaking?

42:57.103 --> 42:58.758
Finally a wash plant.
That's what's shaking.

42:58.793 --> 43:00.172
Yeah. Finally.

43:00.206 --> 43:02.413
It was when we left. Yeah.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.034
What's up?

43:09.241 --> 43:11.241
[Chris] First cleanup
in our new home.

43:11.275 --> 43:12.827
[Parker] Still got my seat.

43:12.862 --> 43:14.275
[Chris] Yup.

43:14.310 --> 43:16.275
[narrator]
Nearly seven weeks in

43:16.310 --> 43:18.827
and later than ever before,

43:18.862 --> 43:22.793
Parker is about
to see his first gold.

43:22.827 --> 43:25.758
So sluice just fired right
off pretty as a picture, eh?

43:25.793 --> 43:28.241
Yeah, it's just, you know,
easy as press and go.

43:28.275 --> 43:30.517
Wave the magic wand.
Wash plant set up, go.

43:30.551 --> 43:31.758
[Chris] Yeah. Yeah.

43:31.793 --> 43:33.344
But, yeah, it was nice
having Tupper up here

43:33.379 --> 43:35.379
-helping, for sure.
-[Chris] Oh, for sure.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.724
I made him sweat and got him
to haul the wash plant.

43:37.758 --> 43:39.655
-So...
-[both laughing]

43:39.689 --> 43:41.379
He was pretty nervous
when he first jumped in,

43:41.413 --> 43:42.758
but he was happy
when he got it

43:42.793 --> 43:44.379
down there in one piece.

43:44.413 --> 43:45.896
Well, it's nice to be back
on Ken's ground

43:45.931 --> 43:47.793
after, you know, last season.

43:47.827 --> 43:51.034
It's not nice to me.
We're too spread out.

43:51.068 --> 43:53.310
More than ever, I'm gonna be
relying on you guys.

43:53.344 --> 43:56.137
Anything less
than 5,000 ounces this year

43:56.172 --> 43:57.965
is gonna put us
in a pretty tight spot.

43:58.655 --> 43:59.965
Well, how did we do, Doumitt?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.620
[Chris] Well, we can throw it
on a scale and see.

44:05.034 --> 44:05.896
[Tyson] Ten,

44:06.344 --> 44:07.551
20,

44:08.206 --> 44:09.482
40,

44:09.517 --> 44:10.689
80,

44:11.413 --> 44:13.000
100,

44:13.034 --> 44:14.517
110,

44:16.413 --> 44:18.482
116 even.

44:20.344 --> 44:22.827
[Chris] We have 116 there,

44:22.862 --> 44:26.068
plus I did some mining
on my own,

44:26.103 --> 44:28.586
and I dug up the tailings
from this gold room

44:28.620 --> 44:30.275
and reran that,

44:30.310 --> 44:32.000
and I picked up
nine ounces of [bleep].

44:32.034 --> 44:33.758
Chris, you're paying
for some bills.

44:33.793 --> 44:35.551
-[laughing]
-[Chris] Yeah.

44:35.586 --> 44:39.448
So that actually gives
a total of 125 ounces even.

44:39.482 --> 44:42.827
[narrator] Worth a quarter
of a million dollars.

44:42.862 --> 44:44.379
So the first gold
of the season, right?

44:44.413 --> 44:45.655
There you go, man.

44:45.689 --> 44:47.448
And nice-looking stuff too.

44:47.482 --> 44:49.068
Just need a lot more of it.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.379
-Yeah.
-[Parker] Yeah.

44:50.413 --> 44:52.724
We spent a lot of money
this spring. More than ever.

44:52.758 --> 44:55.931
But I'm not looking backwards,
I'm looking forward. So...

44:55.965 --> 44:57.137
And it's good to see some gold

44:57.172 --> 44:58.793
and it looks
like two ounces an hour.

44:58.827 --> 45:00.275
And it's not bad.

45:00.310 --> 45:01.827
We'll be all right.

45:01.862 --> 45:03.620
-I think.
-[Tyson laughs]

45:03.655 --> 45:06.655
[dramatic music playing]
