Hey.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.084
We're gonna get you
out of this.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.961
Now, can you remember
anything else

19:31.044 --> 19:32.296
about the man
who approached you?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.590
Anything at all?
No detail is too small.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.259
- All I can remember is
that when I was in the SUV,

19:37.342 --> 19:39.595
he yanked my hands
behind my back

19:39.678 --> 19:42.389
and held them really tight.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.765
He was really rough

19:43.849 --> 19:45.392
when he forced the collar
around my neck.

19:45.475 --> 19:46.935
- Wait.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.396
He held your hands--
both of them--

19:49.479 --> 19:51.273
while he applied the collar?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.985
- Yes, so there
must've been a second guy.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.905
- Jubal, we're positioned
a short distance

19:57.988 --> 19:59.406
outside the plaza.
Any update?

19:59.489 --> 20:01.325
- Yes, before that timer
hits zero,

20:01.408 --> 20:03.577
you now have to find
two needles in a haystack.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.245
- So wait, if they just
evade us long enough,

20:05.329 --> 20:06.955
then it'll explode on its own?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.333
- And if they see you coming,
they can trigger it.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.460
But only one of them
has a detonator.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.462
- How do we know that?

20:13.545 --> 20:14.838
- Bomb techs say
it's highly unlikely

20:14.922 --> 20:16.256
there'd be
two triggering devices.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.966
Something about signal clarity.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.385
- And we're looking for
a late model black SUV, right?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.346
- Yeah, Elise said it was
parked on Worth Street,

20:22.429 --> 20:23.847
just south of 26 FED.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.641

20:25.724 --> 20:26.725
There's no sign
of that vehicle.

20:26.808 --> 20:29.144
- Okay, but the detonator's
signal range is only

20:29.227 --> 20:32.105
about 400 yards, so I'm sure
they're still close by.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.315
- Okay, if they're
watching the exits,

20:33.398 --> 20:35.651
that means we have to canvass
both sides of the building.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.152
- Okay, we're gonna split up
on foot

20:37.235 --> 20:38.320

- Yeah.

We'll give you an update.

deactivate that bomb,

20:53.418 --> 20:55.462

to release you.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.664

than that woman's life?

21:30.747 --> 21:31.873

21:31.957 --> 21:33.500
how could I be sure
you'd keep your word?

21:33.583 --> 21:36.211

listened to me.

For your sake.
It was your call, Isobel.

41:28.986 --> 41:32.031
If things break the wrong way,
you're gonna take the hit.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.824
It's the cost of being a hero.

41:33.908 --> 41:37.244
- I understand.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.581
- You just saved
that woman's life.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.082
That's something
to be proud of,

41:42.166 --> 41:43.751
something to hold onto.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.253
The press is waiting for you
out front.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.088
Probably best
that you to find a way

41:48.172 --> 41:50.132
to put a positive spin
on all this.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.263
- Okay.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.266
Today, we confronted and killed
the man responsible

41:59.350 --> 42:01.936
for last night's murder
of an NYPD officer,

42:02.019 --> 42:03.187
Tony Sanchez.

42:03.270 --> 42:07.733
Incidental to that shooting,
we apprehended Antonio Vargas,

42:07.816 --> 42:12.321
a man long rumored to be
the head of the Durango cartel.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.989
We interrogated Mr. Vargas,

42:14.073 --> 42:15.449
but did not have
enough evidence

42:15.532 --> 42:17.076
to charge him with a crime.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.410
- You didn't have
enough evidence.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.828
How is that possible?

42:19.912 --> 42:21.205
Wasn't he connected
to the shooting

42:21.288 --> 42:22.957
of Officer Sanchez?

42:23.040 --> 42:25.459
[solemn music]

42:25.542 --> 42:27.836
- Holding him was problematic,

42:27.920 --> 42:32.216
but Mr. Vargas is now
squarely in the FBI's sights.

42:32.299 --> 42:34.468
An active investigation
is underway,

42:34.551 --> 42:38.514
and we are confident
he will be brought to justice

42:38.597 --> 42:39.974
very soon.
