00:05.440 --> 00:07.476
-Jake?
-Yeah?

00:07.640 --> 00:11.110
-Are you praying?
-lt's okay. l'm not in school.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.509
No, no, it's fine.
What are you praying for?

00:14.720 --> 00:16.233
l have a math test on Monday.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.151
Oh, so you're praying
for a good grade?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.351
No, that never works.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.750
l'm praying for the teacher
to get sick.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.309
Have you considered just studying
for the test?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.672
How would that help?

00:30.760 --> 00:32.192
Okay, listen to me.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.352
Even if we were to assume a God
who would be willing. . .

00:35.520 --> 00:38.273
-. . .to give your teacher a cold--
-Anthrax.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.074
-All right, that's it. No more praying.
-What are you, the Supreme Court?

00:44.120 --> 00:46.111
How do you know
about the Supreme Court?

00:46.320 --> 00:49.153
This guy on TV, Reverend Don.
He talks to God.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.588
He said you should pray
to strike down your teacher?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.876
No, activist judges.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.440
But l figured why can't it work
on Ms. Stanley?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.069
You know what else,
lf l send Reverend Don money. . .

01:03.240 --> 01:05.355
. . .God will make me rich.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.108
And did you send him money?

01:07.320 --> 01:08.878
Wouldn't you?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.277
No. God doesn't make people rich.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.556
And even if he did,
it wouldn't make you happy.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.438
Well, l disagree.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.633
Jake.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.714
Reward without effort is meaningless.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.350
Money alone will not
give you fulfillment.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.675
What about Uncle Charlie?

01:24.840 --> 01:26.910
He seems fulfilled
and he doesn't do anything.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.389
Hey, hey, let me tell you
about your Uncle Charlie.

01:29.560 --> 01:34.031
He puts on a happy face,
but on the inside he is a sad, lonely man.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.040 --> 01:47.678
You see?

02:16.280 --> 02:17.918
l'm about to do a load of laundry.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.674
Last chance to change
your underwear.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.394
l'm good.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.111
Hold off on the washing machine.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.232
l think Charlie and his friend
are still in the shower.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.272
l'll check.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.473
You were right.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.276
l wouldn't wait for me to get that.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.950
-Hello.
-Hello.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.474
We haven't met.
l'm Norma Seabury from next door.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.989
Oh, it's nice to finally meet you.
l'm Alan Harper.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.909
Harper?
Are you related to that dreadful Charlie?

03:09.560 --> 03:13.235
My mother says l am, but frankly,
l have my doubts l'm related to her.

03:14.840 --> 03:19.118
Well, Alan, there's a little red sports car
blocking my driveway.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.432
l assume it belongs to one
of your brother's whores.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.672
-One of his what?
-Whores.

03:30.400 --> 03:35.030
Ever since he moved in here,
it's been one endless parade of whores.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.509
Oh, whores.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.433
Well, in all fairness. . .

03:40.600 --> 03:43.398
. . .most of them don't have
the math skills to be whores.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.433
Be that as it may,
l'm late for my hair appointment. . .

03:46.600 --> 03:48.875
. . .and l want that car moved
immediately.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.399
Absolutely. l am so sorry.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.553
Let me track down
the whore in question. . .

03:54.760 --> 03:56.955
. . .and ask her to move it.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.792
Thank you.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.639
-God bless you.
-He'd better, l sent in 5 bucks.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.554
Charlie, we have a situation.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.354
Okay, that looks pretty clean.
Now do me.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.750
This is so unfair.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.389
Excuse me.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.835
Not now, Alan. l'm making bubbles.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.474
l don't care what her name is.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.755
Her car is blocking
our neighbor's driveway.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.759
Oh, sorry, l'll move it.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.518
You can't go now, you're busy.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.957
Oh, yeah. l'm busy.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.118
All right, just tell me where the keys are
and l'll move it.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.471
Oh, gosh, no.
l don't let strange men touch my car.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.195
Oh, good, at least you have respect
for your car.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.475
Alan, do we need to have
another boundaries talk?

04:55.640 --> 04:56.914
No, l'm leaving.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.439
Look what's dirty again.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.028
Okay, l have located the owner
of the sports car.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.356
ls she going to pull it out?

05:20.160 --> 05:21.673
Not for a while.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.519
Well, how am l supposed to
get to my hair appointment?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.995
Well, gee, l'd say that
you really don't need one.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.754
l mean, l think your hair
looks lovely as it is.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.592
Well, aren't you sweet?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.151
Are you homosexual?

05:34.880 --> 05:36.359
No, just sweet.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.080
You don't have to miss
your appointment. l'll drive you.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.712
-You would do that for me?
-lt'd be my pleasure.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.759
Sure you're not homosexual?

05:46.160 --> 05:47.673
Positive.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.190
You would have made a good one.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.878
-Going home already?
-No, l'm going to the opera.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.152
They can't end it until l sing.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.592
There's no call for sarcasm.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.438
No.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.713
-What's up?
-What is that old witch doing here?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.036
Old witch? She's--
She's a charming woman.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.952
Of course she's charming.
They all are.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.998
That's how they lure you into
their houses made of gingerbread.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.198
What exactly is the deal between you?

06:29.360 --> 06:32.238
-Why do you hate her?
-Why don't ask her why she hates me.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.194
She told me you're a horrible neighbor
who doesn't care about anyone.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.631
There you go. How can l like somebody
who talks about me like that?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.429
Hello, Mr. Harper.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.678
Hey, Norma.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.032
Eat any little kids lately?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.118
l could ask you the same thing.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.073
Oh, and by the way. . .

06:54.280 --> 06:57.352
. . .will she be moving her car
out of my driveway any time soon?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.630
Maybe people wouldn't park
in your driveway. . .

06:59.800 --> 07:02.360
. . .if you didn't put your trash
in my guest parking spot.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.476
You don't have a guest parking spot.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.949
There's no such thing
as a guest parking spot.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.477
lt's called a curb
and it belongs to the city of Malibu.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.719
Hey, if l can pass out on it,
l figure it's mine.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.558
Well, by that logic, l--

07:16.720 --> 07:19.598
l guess you own my doghouse too.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.793
That only happened once
and Bruno was fine with it.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.039
Alan. . .

07:26.840 --> 07:28.751
. . .thank you so much
for a wonderful day.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.557
l'm looking forward to next Saturday.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.392
Oh, me too.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.075
And as for you, Mr. Harper. . .

07:36.280 --> 07:40.114
. . .Bruno never had fleas
before that night.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.632
You passed out in her doghouse?

07:46.840 --> 07:49.832
Hey, l've passed out in wheelbarrows,
but this isn't about me.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.555
-Oh, really? Who is it about?
-You.

07:53.480 --> 07:57.393
Why are you dating a woman who
lost her virginity during World War ll?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.229
And knowing her,
probably not to one of our guys.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.117
First of all, we are not dating.
l'm escorting her to a charity event.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.396
Second of all, her age is irrelevant.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.636
The only thing that matters
is what's inside.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.913
The only thing inside her is dust
and undigested mastodon meat.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.678
She's isn't that old, Charlie.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.677
Come on,
l bet she was an eyewitness. . .

08:16.840 --> 08:18.831
-. . .to the birth of agriculture.
-Stop it.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.635
Her high school graduation picture's
probably on a cave wall in France.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.149
Are you done?

08:26.480 --> 08:27.879
Her prom theme was ''Fire'' .

08:30.480 --> 08:33.517
Charlie, l can't figure out
how to turn off the shower.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.075
There's so many knobs.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.989
That's okay. Just dry off
and l'll take care of it.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.592
Thanks.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.951
How does it feel dating a woman
whose lQ is the same as her age?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.473
l could ask you the same thing.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.957
Oh, here's something else
we have in common.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.673
Both our girls are pruney. . .

08:53.840 --> 08:56.354
. . .but mine's gonna plump back up
in a little while.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.030
Well, thank you for a lovely evening.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.674
Oh, no, thank you for taking me.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.479
l so loathe going to these things
by myself.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.954
And dancing.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.156
l can't remember
the last time l danced.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.475
That was fun.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.874
One more spin?

09:17.680 --> 09:19.113
Okay, sure.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.034
Thank you for being so kind
to a lonely old gal.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.471
Stop saying that. You are not old.
You're a vibrant fascinating woman.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.677
-l had a great time with you tonight.
-Likewise.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.515
And l want you to give some serious
thought to my offer.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.109
l will, l will.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.919
Okay, so-- So good night.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.031
Good night.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.278
All right.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.557
-Morning.
-Morning.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.914
Who sent the flowers?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.315
l'll give you a hint.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.669
-Wait until you see the card.
-You read the card?

10:32.880 --> 10:35.394
l couldn't. lt's in Aramaic.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.157
Okay, l get it. She's old.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.716
lt was delivered by
a Roman centurion.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.151
Oh, jeez, l've got a problem.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.039
lf you got her pregnant,
we can get a full page in Ripley's.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.915
Give it a rest, Charlie.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.032
Come on, l've been
working on these all morning.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.839
Listen to this.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.719
Her first car was a chariot.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.110
She called her first husband ''Hun''
because he was one.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.759
Her first Christmas
was the first Christmas.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.037
Likes to take long walks
on the beach. . .

11:18.200 --> 11:21.078
. . .after crawling out of the ocean
and growing legs.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.395
Her birthstone is lava.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.271
And finally, the big bang. . . .

11:29.880 --> 11:32.758
l don't have a joke for that yet,
but l know there's something.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.509
l'm leaving.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.549
Oh, come on, l'm your brother.
You can talk to me.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.029
Okay, l promise, no more jokes.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.760
-Tell me what the problem is.
-Okay.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.678
Well, you know she's rich, right?

11:45.880 --> 11:47.393
Richer than God. . .

11:47.560 --> 11:50.791
. . .who she's known
since he was yay high.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.159
You promised.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.713
Sorry, yeah. Yeah.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.754
Well, last night Norma made me
a business proposition.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.439
l'll bet it involved--

12:00.600 --> 12:02.795
No. No. No.
No telegraphs, no flying machines.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.269
No Niña, no Pinta,
no Santa Maria.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.792
You don't have to bite my head off.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.876
l was talking about what l do
for a living. . .

12:11.040 --> 12:14.874
. . .and she said she wanted
to invest in me.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.752
lnvest in you? How?

12:16.960 --> 12:18.439
She wants to buy a building. . .

12:18.600 --> 12:21.034
. . .and create
the Alan Harper Healing Center.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.671
Chiropractics, acupuncture,
holistic pharmacy, aromatherapy--

12:25.880 --> 12:28.678
Why don't you just call it
the Alan Harper House of Crap?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.956
Norma chose the name.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.794
l see.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.118
And in exchange for all this,
she expects you to:

12:40.560 --> 12:44.269
Well, nothing has been
said explicitly, but. . .

12:44.440 --> 12:45.998
. . .yeah.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.991
-And you're considering it?
-No. No, of course not.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.196
-Not really.
-Not really?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.595
Well, the building would be
in Beverly Hills. . .

12:56.760 --> 12:58.751
. . .and it would have
my name on the top.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.837
Big letters but with a real classy font.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.433
l'm thinking Helvetica.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.995
Okay, l see your dilemma.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.550
-We gotta think this through.
-Thanks, thanks. l really need to.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.077
You'd do her for free
if she was young and beautiful, right?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.071
Well, sure, l-- l suppose.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.671
And you'd stick your dingus
in a beehive. . .

13:18.840 --> 13:21.308
. . .for, say, a hundred million,
wouldn't you?

13:26.960 --> 13:30.589
A hundred million dollars? Probably.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.833
But where are we going with this?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.270
We've established
that you're a manwhore. . .

13:36.440 --> 13:38.795
. . .now we're just trying to zero in
on your price.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.035
Charlie, you're not helping at all.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.113
Alan, did you really think l would?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.954
-Good to see you again, Ms. Seabury.
-Thank you, Bobby.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.031
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.552
Good luck.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.469
Go away, Bobby.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.553
So, Alan. . .

14:04.760 --> 14:07.797
. . .have you given any more thought
to my little business proposal?

14:07.960 --> 14:11.236
Well, actually, l have and--

14:11.400 --> 14:13.994
Oh, wait, l forgot.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.957
l brought you a little gifty.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.549
Oh, no, Norma, plea--
You've been too kind already--

14:18.720 --> 14:20.438
Oh, my God, a Rolex.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.389
-A platinum Rolex.
-A platinum Rolex.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.869
l have always wanted
a platinum Rolex.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.156
l almost bought one for myself,
but silly me. . .

14:28.320 --> 14:30.470
. . .l got health insurance
for family instead.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.591
-Let me put it on you.
-Okay.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.671
lt's-- lt's a lot heavier
than my calculator Swatch.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.076
l'm glad you like it.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.434
Champagne for madame. . .

14:41.600 --> 14:44.398
. . .and her special friend.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.196
Hey, Bobby, look.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.278
Very nice, sir.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.830
This is too much. l can't accept this.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.316
Oh, l think you can.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.751
Yeah, l probably can.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.918
A toast.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.310
To the Alan Harper Healing Center.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.638
-Okay.
-And to us.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.949
To us as-- As business partners
and friends, right?

15:14.160 --> 15:15.434
Wrong.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.430
-Alan?
-What?

15:23.640 --> 15:25.437
l proposed a toast.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.513
Oh, yes. l'm sorry, it's just. . .

15:27.680 --> 15:30.638
-. . .this is all happening so fast.
-Yes.

15:30.840 --> 15:35.709
Well, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.393
The question is, Alan. . .

15:39.160 --> 15:41.196
. . .what do you want?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.873
Hurry up, sugar buns.
l'm not getting any younger.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.599
Charlie.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.159
Wake up.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.880
What? What's wrong?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.516
l had sex with Norma.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.030
-What?
-l gave in.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.599
l folded.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.830
l let her have her way with me.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.029
How was it?

16:35.560 --> 16:37.152
Actually. . .

16:37.320 --> 16:39.197
. . .it was great.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.233
She. . .

16:43.960 --> 16:45.313
. . .knew stuff.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.308
-ls that a Rolex?
-Yeah.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.072
Platinum.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.873
Nice.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.476
And you get a building in Beverly Hills.
Not bad for a night's work.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.555
Well, actually, l-- l don't think
l'm gonna be getting the building.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.672
She reneged?

17:05.880 --> 17:08.678
She died.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.519
You're kidding.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.678
After we were done. . .

17:18.839 --> 17:20.397
. . .she looked at me. . .

17:20.920 --> 17:24.117
. . .mumbled a couple of words,
closed her eyes and then:

17:25.200 --> 17:26.633
Dead.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.553
That's it. l knew there was
a big bang joke.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.515
l mean, l'm sorry.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.796
l just can't believe it.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.473
Me neither.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.756
After all those years of
making me miserable. . .

17:43.920 --> 17:45.911
. . .she's actually gone.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.236
lt's weird, l-- l feel a little sad.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.589
lmagine how l feel.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.711
Yeah, you killed her.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.509
So, what did she mumble
before she, you know. . . .

17:59.680 --> 18:03.036
Well, l'm not sure,
but l think she said:

18:03.880 --> 18:05.518
''l want my watch back. ''

18:08.720 --> 18:10.756
Hey, l tried my best
to keep up with her.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.918
l've been up half the night
with the police and the coroners.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.556
You have no idea how judgmental
those people are.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.234
You can't worry about
what anyone else thinks, Alan.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.109
The thing you gotta remember
and keep close to your heart is. . .

18:27.320 --> 18:30.596
. . .l get an extra parking space
and you get to keep the watch.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.998
Enjoy it, buddy.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.673
But how can l enjoy it?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.434
The same way l enjoy
that grand piano downstairs.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.830
What does your piano have any--

18:42.000 --> 18:43.399
Wait a minute. Are--

18:43.560 --> 18:45.949
Are you saying that--?
That you slept with Norma?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.636
Hey, l needed a piano.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.475
So-- So if you slept with Norma,
why did she hate you so much?

18:59.160 --> 19:02.197
Probably because
l only needed one piano.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.992
You're right, though.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.355
She did know stuff.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.236
Hey, can you put on channel 84?
l wanna watch Reverend Don.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.470
Well, l wanna watch football.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.153
lt's the Lord's day.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.234
Yeah, but it's my TV.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.835
-Who'd you bet on?
-Packers minus one and a half.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.275
lf the Vikings don't score,
l'm up a grand.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.953
Okay.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.234
What are you doing?

19:39.400 --> 19:41.834
Praying for the Vikings to score.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.513
Don't do that. Are you crazy?

19:43.720 --> 19:46.359
-Change the channel to Reverend Don.
-No.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.391
Then you leave me no choice.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.119
Okay, you wanna play that way? Fine.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.675
lt won't work.
God answers kids' prayers first.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.077
-Who told you that?
-Nobody. lt just makes sense.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.669
That last drive put the Vikings
in field goal range.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.876
Oh, God, oh, God.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.270
Too little, too late.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.954
Here comes the Vikings kicking unit
out onto the field.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.793
Pray for my side l'll give you
a piece of my winnings.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.313
-How much?
-Five percent.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.635
No deal.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.149
Edinger has yet to miss
from this distance.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.998
-Okay, 1 0.
-Twenty.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.230
-Twenty?
-And there's the snap.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.630
-Deal.
-The kick is up.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.519
-It's good.
-Oh, no.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.753
Don't blame me. You're a sinner.
