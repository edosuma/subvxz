-Welcome.
-Thank you.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.725
This is
Miss Harberg's suite.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.727
The bedroom is
on your right.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.437
On your left,
you have the living room

01:44.521 --> 01:46.189
with a direct access
to the terrace,

01:46.272 --> 01:48.858
and the beautiful
view of Paris.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.361
-This is a living room?
-Groom: Yes, it is.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.281
-Very nice.
-Groom: Mm-hm.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.618
This is the bathroom that
opens into the living room?

01:58.701 --> 02:00.829
Uh, yes, it does.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.997
Honestly, Carla,
it's small...

02:03.081 --> 02:04.624
and Mira's not
gonna be happy.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.960
It's not small.
It's more Parisian,

02:07.043 --> 02:10.880
and, and charming,
and, and, and cozy.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.758
This is no big production.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.176
We can't afford The Plaza.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.678
That was clear
from the start.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.971
And Zelda approved of it?

02:18.054 --> 02:22.725
Well, she didn't reply,
but we assumed it was fine.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.770
Okay, well, I'm gonna call Zelda
and figure something out.

02:28.147 --> 02:31.025
-(line ringing)
-Zelda: (on phone) Hello?

02:31.109 --> 02:34.445
Hey, she's gonna freak out
when she sees this room.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.448
I mean, it's nice,
but it's a fucking
junior suite.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.200
I told her not to get
involved with those people.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.410
What else can I do?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.036
Regina: (on phone)
You told her that?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.955
That's insane.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.708
This is exactly the part
she's been dying to play.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.209
Zelda:
Who do you think
you're talking to?

02:48.293 --> 02:49.794
Your job is to book flights,

02:49.878 --> 02:52.255
to keep her entertained,
and to make sure she sees emails

02:52.338 --> 02:53.798
that would end up
in her spam folder,

02:53.882 --> 02:56.259
and I don't think you have
the brain to do that job,

02:56.342 --> 02:59.387
so let's not start thinking you
have the capacity to do mine.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.598
Part of your job is
to keep her happy,

03:01.681 --> 03:04.100
and she hasn't been
for a while, so.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.060
Zelda:
She has no reason
to complain.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.104
"Doomsday" is a massive hit!

03:08.187 --> 03:09.480
Time to cash in.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.691
That's so not her.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.401
Yeah, it's me,
and as far as I know,

03:13.484 --> 03:14.903
she takes advice from her agent,

03:14.986 --> 03:16.446
so thank you for your insights,

03:16.529 --> 03:19.532
but let's keep
the decision-making
to the adults.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.493
Carla:
Okay, quiet during
the make-up test.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.079
(camera beeps)

03:25.163 --> 03:28.374
Jeremie:
If you come close...
to the camera.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.502
Tighter.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.546
It's a very tight closeup.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.757
Even tighter.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.386
Yes.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.139
If you walk around now,

03:43.222 --> 03:46.893
I'd like to
see how the light plays
on the catsuit.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.812
Look at us.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.277
Uh, I lost you.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.031
(laughs)
Okay.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.493
Again, a bit closer.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.119
-And cut.
-(camera beeps)

04:05.203 --> 04:06.955
One last picture
and I'm done.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.790
Mira: Great.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.710
Sorry.

04:14.253 --> 04:17.131
-(camera clicks)
-Okay, perfect.
Is it the last look?

04:17.215 --> 04:18.841
Carla:
Yeah, we're good.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.096
That's okay.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
-Great.
-Mira: Yeah, it's okay.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.768
-Laetitia: The style is
almost like Musidora.
-Mira: Yeah.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.144
Right, let's take
off your hood.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.771
I'll walk you
to your dressing room.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.148
Great, yeah,
it's getting hot.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.525
It's a nice hotel,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.235
but we really had
to twist their arm

04:37.318 --> 04:39.404
to get a decent suite.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.488
Well, you're in Europe.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.864
They have a culture
of saving

04:41.948 --> 04:42.991
on whatever they can.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.993
It's a TV show.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.329
It's not some...
indie feature.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.248
(door opening)

04:50.331 --> 04:52.166
Zelda wants you
to call her back.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.710
I will tomorrow.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.462
Please,
she's already called you,
like, three times.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.885
(line chiming)

05:02.969 --> 05:05.304
Zelda: (on tablet)
Heard they're shutting
down your show.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.140
Why would they do that?

05:07.223 --> 05:08.891
Can't get René insured.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.394
Mira:
Anybody can get insured.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.479
Yeah... if you pay.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.815
And they're asking
for a shitload.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.817
Pack your bags,
and get the hell
out of there, okay?

05:17.900 --> 05:18.860
This is bad news.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.779
Well, no one here
seems to know.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.197
Zelda:
They know it.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.867
They're just not telling you.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.368
Okay, you have five minutes?

05:27.452 --> 05:31.414
No. I wanna take off
my makeup and get going.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.958
Zelda:
I want to discuss
the "Silver Surfer" sequel.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.502
Yes, and we've
already discussed it.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.462
Zelda:
They want you.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
Yeah, but it's
a boring part.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.090
I'm tired of being
the girlfriend.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.091
Zelda: Listen.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.969
Here's the twist--
it's a reboot.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.555
Okay? Silver Surfer dies,
and the girlfriend takes over.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.725
This is exactly what
people want right now.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.435
High-concept, feminist,

05:52.518 --> 05:54.479
lady-led superhero movie.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.106
All right?
They are gonna
go nuts over this.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.399
Mira:
Are you serious?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.819
You want me to play
the Silver Surfer?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.155
She wants me to play
the Silver Surfer.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.740
Zelda:
Yeah, I sure do.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.034
I would even pay to see it.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.953
And they're ready
to write you a blank check.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.790
Who's directing?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.541
Zelda:
A hot new British filmmaker.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.629
He directed Grimes' videos.
His name escapes me.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.756
-(Mira sighs)
-Zelda: Babe...

06:21.839 --> 06:23.883
"Irma Vep" is not happening.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.511
All right? Don't worry,
I'll make sure they pay you out,

06:26.594 --> 06:29.138
but, uh... get over it.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.643
(speaking French)

06:36.229 --> 06:37.522
(door closes)

07:11.722 --> 07:12.932
Oui, oui.

09:07.046 --> 09:11.175
-Mira: Do you come here a lot?
-I haven't been here for ages.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.428
(upbeat club music playing)

09:16.681 --> 09:18.557
(indistinct chatter)

09:18.641 --> 09:20.476
There's a seat over there.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.937
I spoke to my agent.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.855
She said they're
shutting us down.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.985
-Absolutely not.
-You sure?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.278
What would you
like to drink?

09:30.361 --> 09:32.572
-Do you want a beer?
-Thanks.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.453
Well, they found
another insurer

09:39.537 --> 09:42.957
who's covering René
with no extra cost.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.166
But you want me
to be honest?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.502
I think they should
shut us down.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.421
(chuckles)

09:48.504 --> 09:50.214
Why do you say that?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.425
Because René is nuts.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.885
Yeah, I've heard,

09:54.969 --> 09:56.929
but, you know,
based on my experience,

09:57.013 --> 10:00.016
I think...
he's nuts in a good way.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.684
Yeah, I love him very much--

10:01.767 --> 10:04.979
Well, most of the time,
but he can be scary nuts.

10:05.062 --> 10:05.980
Well, no offense meant,

10:06.063 --> 10:09.442
but... you're something
of a kook, too.

10:09.525 --> 10:13.446
I'm wardrobe.
Who cares if I have
a screw loose?

10:14.905 --> 10:17.533
-So, the show is happening?
-It is.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.662
So, I'm not
going back to LA?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.581
Did you want
to go back to LA?

10:23.664 --> 10:25.833
No. (sighs)
Not really.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.169
Because you broke up
with Laurie?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.713
No.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.173
If you go back to LA,

10:32.256 --> 10:34.467
you'll end up
seeing her again.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.304
Not if I can avoid it.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.806
Do you trust yourself?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.516
Mira: No.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.769
I trusted Laurie, though.

10:47.605 --> 10:52.068
I, I, I opened up,
I let her in.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.363
Uh... she chose
to take advantage of it.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.531
But it was great.

10:57.615 --> 11:02.536
It was great, so great...
before it went toxic.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.414
Anyway, she helped me
out of this relationship

11:05.498 --> 11:09.293
with my ex, Eamonn,
that was going nowhere.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.253
Um, I wouldn't have
done it on my own,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.756
so... I should
be grateful.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.804
I thought you and Eamonn
were madly in love.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.932
We had, um...

11:23.015 --> 11:27.103
two good years, and...
the third year was hell.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.855
That's not at all
what he told the media.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.233
Well, Eamonn
rewrites the story.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.569
Well, you dumped a megastar
for your assistant.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.114
-He felt humiliated.
-Or angry.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.492
A lot of people got
angry on social media.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.829
You know what?
You're not supposed
to date your employee.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.456
They loved it when Laurie
turned the tables on me.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.584
They felt vindicated,
and they made sure I knew.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.002
What about you?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.588
How did you feel?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.424
The wild thing is...

11:59.677 --> 12:01.220
that it turned me on.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.515
(laughing)

12:06.642 --> 12:09.854
("99 Luftballons"
by Nena playing)

12:12.273 --> 12:16.610
So, you prefer
chaos in Paris
to loneliness in LA?

12:16.694 --> 12:20.406
You know what?
I have no fucking idea.

this movement...

until the end.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.670

16:44.753 --> 16:46.630

very high, yes.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.221

I am angry with Laurie,

41:35.159 --> 41:38.370
but... that's real life.

41:38.454 --> 41:39.788
Our life.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.166
And the games
she wants to play
on the fuckin' internet

41:42.249 --> 41:44.251
are the least
of my concerns.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.338
She praises
Herman to no end,

41:47.421 --> 41:49.506
like he's changed her life.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.134
I know... Gross.

41:52.218 --> 41:55.804
What was it like
working with him?

41:55.888 --> 41:58.974
Uh, he's a pro.

41:59.058 --> 42:03.312
He loves doing what he does,
and he's a good guy,

42:03.395 --> 42:06.273
but I wouldn't pay
to see a movie of his.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.566
(both chuckle)

42:08.984 --> 42:11.612
Are we really talking
about Herman now?

42:12.988 --> 42:15.407
Was it your first time
with a girl?

42:16.909 --> 42:17.868
Yeah.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.579
And it left you
a little bit confused.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.290
I guess so.

42:25.417 --> 42:26.627
(knocks on door)

42:26.710 --> 42:28.212
(door opens)

42:28.921 --> 42:29.797
Are you done?

42:29.880 --> 42:31.715
They're waiting for you on set.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.758
I-I-I'm sorry.

42:32.841 --> 42:35.052
I had no idea
you guys were waiting.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.378
Guys, no need to argue.

43:09.461 --> 43:14.133
We did a good job,
and I'm... happy.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.427
(softly)
Let's get going.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.262
What are we starting with?

43:18.345 --> 43:19.847
Carla:
Irma Vep has been
hired as a maid

43:19.930 --> 43:21.181
at Philippe Guérande's place,

43:21.265 --> 43:24.476
-and she wants to get
the red codebook back.
-Sure.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.353
I meant
the Grand Inquisitor's
codebook

43:26.437 --> 43:28.814
with all the secrets
of the Vampires.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.692
That never made
sense to me.

43:31.775 --> 43:34.069
I mean, why would
the Vampires be so dumb

43:34.153 --> 43:37.489
as to write down
all their secrets
in a notebook?

43:37.573 --> 43:38.741
I have no idea.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.079
Oh, s-sorry to keep
you waiting.

43:44.163 --> 43:48.042
No worries, uh.
We, we had, uh,
stuff to fine-tune.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.793
So, this is, uh,
Philippe's bedroom,

43:49.877 --> 43:52.338
and, uh, just y-you'll
open this window.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.840
Look.
And then through here,

43:54.923 --> 43:57.051
she will let
the Vampire in.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.553
And...

43:59.636 --> 44:01.889
And, uh, the Vampire
will search this desk

44:01.972 --> 44:03.766
for the red codebook.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.310
Can I ask you something?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.270
René:
I'm here to help.

44:08.354 --> 44:11.023
Yeah, I just need
a little clarification.

44:11.106 --> 44:13.692
Um... do you want a coffee?

44:13.776 --> 44:17.696
-Uh, yes.
-Okay, come, um.

44:17.780 --> 44:22.576
-So... you know,
if I were a Vampire--
-Mm-hm.

44:22.659 --> 44:24.787
I don't know if
I would, you know,

44:24.870 --> 44:27.039
write down all my secrets.

44:27.122 --> 44:29.917
-Mm-hm.
-Or I would keep them
in a safe, or--

44:30.000 --> 44:34.421
But, uh, w-w-what
do you do with, uh,
your passwords?

44:34.505 --> 44:37.591
-I write them down.
-Uh-huh.

44:37.674 --> 44:41.178
-So, are, are they in a safe?
-Who has a safe?

44:42.262 --> 44:44.348
-Ah, uh.
-See?

44:44.431 --> 44:47.476
I know...
Okay, get your point.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.561
Umm...

44:50.270 --> 44:51.772
So, um...

44:53.232 --> 44:54.733
let's make sure
I got this right.

44:54.817 --> 44:58.278
She's gonna spike
Philippe's herbal tea
with a sedative.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.906
Yeah.
Yeah, like, like, this.

45:00.989 --> 45:02.574
He will be
in a deep sleep

45:02.658 --> 45:05.202
-when the Vampires come in.
-Yeah, and then she's gonna

45:05.285 --> 45:07.579
-steal the red notebook.
-Uh, r-red...

45:07.663 --> 45:09.748
-The red codebook, yeah.
-...code-code-codebook.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.916
(chuckles)

45:10.999 --> 45:12.418
And, and the whole plan

45:12.501 --> 45:15.671
depends on Philippe
drinking herbal tea

45:15.754 --> 45:16.630
before he sleeps.

45:16.713 --> 45:18.924
Yeah, yeah.
It-it's his habit.

45:19.633 --> 45:20.759
Detox?

45:20.843 --> 45:24.346
-(stammers)
-No, s-- It, it was a joke.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.014
-It is--
-Sorry.

45:26.098 --> 45:29.059
Okay, so, uh--
And, and also,
wh-- like, wh--

45:29.143 --> 45:33.021
Who hired Irma Vep,
uh, to be his maid?

45:33.105 --> 45:36.275
Actually...
his mother did.

45:36.358 --> 45:38.110
Is she still in the film?

45:38.193 --> 45:40.154
I thought you were
getting rid of her.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.406
What I promised,
uh, Edmond

45:42.489 --> 45:44.450
to get him off my back,

45:44.533 --> 45:47.744
but truth is, uh, I kept her.

45:47.828 --> 45:50.247
So, Philippe lives
with his mother.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.083
Cool.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.544
Uh... and she's here.

45:55.627 --> 45:56.962
-Come, come.
-Yeah.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.510
M-Marie-Rose. Marie.
(chuckles)

46:03.594 --> 46:07.389
-Um, Marie-Rose, uh,
I want to introduce you--
-Yes?

46:07.473 --> 46:08.765
to Mira Harberg.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.517
-So nice to meet you.
-Marie-Rose Germon.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.812
She's a grand dame
of French stage.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.147
We're ready to shoot.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.607
-So are we, huh?
-S-See you in a bit.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.860
-See you later. Bye.
-See you later. Bye.

Positions, please!

46:29.077 --> 46:32.539
Is Edmond aware that
Philippe's mother is back?

46:32.623 --> 46:36.543
Uhh, uh, I haven't
told him yet.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.879
It's a kind of surprise.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.672
Can't wait to see his reaction.

46:40.756 --> 46:43.175
I guess he will have to adapt.

46:43.258 --> 46:44.801
-Excuse me. This is the poison.
-(crew speaking French)

46:44.885 --> 46:46.428
