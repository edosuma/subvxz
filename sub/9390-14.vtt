some other groceries I need

they put it on TV,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.988
which makes me a
famous journalist.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.723
Journalist?
You're badgering a celebrity

05:25.725 --> 05:27.592
and passing it off
as news.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.559
Yeah, journalist.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.194
And I got a hundred bucks
for it,

05:30.196 --> 05:32.830

this $4,000 video camera.

dinner with in there?

Was it a guy?
Are you gay?

you were gay.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.020

Well, that's just great,
Lois, that's great.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.815

being touched by women.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.848
It's not harassment
if you like it.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.849
But I didn't like it.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.450
I got sexually
harassed at school.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.719
My chemistry teacher, Mr.
Taylor, rubbed my shoulders

09:48.721 --> 09:52.557
for 35 minutes in class the
one day I didn't wear a bra.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.659
See, Peter,
that's harassment.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.761
An older man,
a weak, younger woman.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.396
He could have
taken advantage of her,

09:58.398 --> 10:00.364
forced her to do
things to him.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.600
He did--
awful things.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.334
See?

10:03.336 --> 10:06.671
But you,
it just can't happen.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.775
Griffin, get in here,

10:10.777 --> 10:13.578
and make sure you have on
your new uniform.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.480
Why am I the only one who
has to wear denim shorts?

10:16.482 --> 10:19.617
Because you're the only one
who looks this good in them.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.920
Damn, Griffin,
you fill those out nicely.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.822
Why is there a
dusty gas station

10:24.824 --> 10:27.792
and a Diet Pepsi
machine in your office?

10:28.660 --> 10:30.628
'Cause your car broke down,
and you need

10:30.630 --> 10:33.731
to wipe a cold soda
on your neck to cool off.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.733
Well, may-maybe I don't
need to cool off.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.370
Maybe you don't
need to be employed.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.511
It's hot in
here, isn't it?

10:47.513 --> 10:48.012
Yes.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.481
You need to cool
off, don't you?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.616
I need to cool off.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.585
You need to wipe your
neck with the soda can.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.555
I need to wipe my neck
with the soda can.

10:57.557 --> 10:58.889
Do it!

11:03.662 --> 11:05.796
Now, get out of
here, you slut.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.965
Okay. Can I keep the soda?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.767
Oh, all right.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.469
Yeah!

11:23.115 --> 11:25.049
Oh...

11:25.051 --> 11:26.150
Oh, God.

11:26.152 --> 11:30.354
I really hope there's
a hungry horse back there.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.524
(phone ringing)

11:33.526 --> 11:34.959
Hello?

11:34.961 --> 11:36.460
Oh, hi, Angela, hang on.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.662
Peter, it's your boss.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.063
I don't want to
talk to her.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.431
She's gonna harass me.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.932
Oh, don't be such a baby.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.468
I'm sorry, Angela,
Peter can't talk.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.070
He's upstairs in the shower

11:46.072 --> 11:48.172
touching himself
to your picture.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.206
Gimme that.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.775
Why are you
calling me at home?

11:50.777 --> 11:52.576
ANGELA:
I want to hear you breathe.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.612
Breathe into the phone
for me, Griffin.
What?

11:54.614 --> 11:57.581
Shh, shh, shh.
Don't talk, just breathe.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.550
It turns me on.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.919
(breathing heavily)

12:06.558 --> 12:07.958
That's it, Griffin.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.126
Keep breathing.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.762
God, I'm almost there.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.763
(moans)

12:12.765 --> 12:15.700
Your breath
is filling me up.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.001
(mumbling)

12:17.003 --> 12:18.469
I like kangaroos.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.503
Oh, sure you do.

12:19.505 --> 12:24.642
Well, tomorrow, I'm getting you
a kangaroo T-shirt.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.380
And she wants me to come over
to her house tonight

12:29.382 --> 12:30.648
to work on
a "special project."

12:30.650 --> 12:32.583
I know she's gonna make me
have sex with her.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.852
What the hell
am I gonna do?
I don't know, Peter.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.088
If you have sex with her,
you give her all the power.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.157
If you don't have sex with her,
you're gay. You can't win.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.692
I don't want to get fired

12:41.694 --> 12:43.427
and have to look
for another job.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.195
What the hell do I do?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.831
I might be able to
help you, Peter.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.668
All right, hurry up, let's
get this over with.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.604
All right, unbutton your shirt
and your pants.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.943
That oughta do it.
Okay, close up.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.245
All right, let me get
lined up right,

13:01.247 --> 13:03.581
so she'll think it's you
she's having sex with.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.849
Wow, that's really clever.
Thanks.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.051
And if you don't feel
like doing Lois later,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.919
I can stick around.
(laughs)

13:08.921 --> 13:11.889
Let's-Let's just
see how this goes.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.458
(doorbell rings)

13:15.093 --> 13:17.395
Hello, Griffin.
Hello, Angela.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.930
You know, Angela, I've been
thinking about it,

13:19.932 --> 13:22.299
and I want to have
sex with you now.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.567
Really?
Giggity.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.102
Yeah, but-but I want
to just do it

13:25.104 --> 13:26.504
through my zipper,
all right?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.873
I-I-I don't want to have
to take off all my clothes,

13:28.875 --> 13:29.840
'cause I'm self-conscious

13:29.842 --> 13:31.742
about my Congressman
Barney Frank body.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.645
Well, I suppose I can
work with that.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.181
QUAGMIRE:
Oh, yuck.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.682
What do you say we go

13:38.684 --> 13:40.084
into the bedroom?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.085
Uh, yeah, sure.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.954
Aw, she's so ugly.
I don't want to get in that.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.690
Peter, I'm-I'm not gonna do it.
Deal's off. Deal's off.

13:46.692 --> 13:47.992
No, it isn't!
Yes, it is.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.795
I'm gonna spread my legs, and
it'll be you doing it, not me.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.829
You better not.
I am.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.631
I'm re-jiggering my position
right now.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.065
Oh, no, you don't!

13:55.067 --> 13:56.967
(both grunting)

13:56.969 --> 13:59.904
What the hell
is going on here?

14:01.673 --> 14:02.206
Oh.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.608
Hi, Angela, I'm Peter's friend,
Glenn Quagmire.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.044
Uh, thank you so much
for having me in your home.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.113
And, um, I would
have had sex with you,

14:09.115 --> 14:10.714
but Peter neglected to tell me

14:10.716 --> 14:12.683
that you are a complete
Dumpster fire.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.151
(chuckles)
Some friend, huh?

14:14.153 --> 14:17.087
Okay, all right,
take it easy.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.989
I am tired
of playing games, Griffin.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.125
I mean, let's go.
I have waited long enough.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.128
I'm having sex with you
right now.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.162
No! I don't wanna!

14:25.164 --> 14:29.099
Griffin, you have sex with me,
or you're fired.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.034
Fine! Fire me!

14:30.036 --> 14:32.636
I'm through being
harassed by you!

14:34.039 --> 14:35.439
You know, this is
awful timing,

14:35.441 --> 14:37.775
but I-I remembered part
of the reason I came over

14:37.777 --> 14:41.745
was 'cause my cousin is looking
for a job at the brewery.

14:41.747 --> 14:45.649
I'll-I'll just put his
résumé under the door.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.958
Gimme another
one, Horace.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.025
All right,
but slow down, Peter.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.261
Or else I'm gonna have to get
that lady boss of yours

14:57.263 --> 15:00.264
to come in here and give you
a good shoe to the gift bag.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.832
You know,
keep you in line.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.733
(all laugh)

15:02.735 --> 15:04.235
I'm just kiddin' ya, Peter.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.036
You'll find yourself
a new job.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.939
MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to Robert Mitchum

15:08.941 --> 15:10.541
in <i>A Backhand for Sally.</i>

15:10.543 --> 15:12.877
You're getting
on that train with me.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.044
I can't go with you.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.713
I just can't. (gasps)

15:15.715 --> 15:17.681
Okay, I'll go.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.016
Ow! I said I'd go.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.252
Why'd you give me the
back of your hand?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.754
Because I love you.

15:25.390 --> 15:28.025
Wow, I thought
you had to be in the NBA

15:28.027 --> 15:29.293
to hit a girl in the face.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.394
But I guess anyone can.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.230
Of course you can hit a girl
in the face.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.398
They have faces, don't they?

15:34.400 --> 15:37.268
Are-Are you talkin' to me,
Robert Mitchum?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.869
You bet your ass I am.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.704
Look at you, you're pathetic.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.440
What kind of a man
gets fired by a broad?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.909
A man with a female boss?

15:44.911 --> 15:45.943
Don't crack wise.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.113
Listen, Peter, somewhere along
the line, you got turned around.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.047
You're a man.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.283
And what do you think
it means to be a man?

15:52.285 --> 15:55.219
Um, it means not gettin'
pushed around.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.921
Exactly.
It means drinkin'

15:56.923 --> 15:59.290
not because I want to,
but because I need to.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.692
Right!
It means standing up to fart,

16:01.694 --> 16:02.860
not hidin' it in a pillow,

16:02.862 --> 16:05.162
or holdin' it in
till your stomach goes...

16:05.164 --> 16:07.331
(growling)

16:07.333 --> 16:10.067
Now you've got it!
Gimme my keys, Horace!

16:10.069 --> 16:12.202
I'm going to see my boss!

16:12.204 --> 16:14.638
But, Peter, you're drunk!

16:14.640 --> 16:15.873
Horace.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.242
You're right.
This is more important.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.110
(tires screeching)

16:23.048 --> 16:25.683
Angela!
Open up in there!

16:25.685 --> 16:27.785
(motor running)

16:32.157 --> 16:34.625
Oh, my God!

16:40.966 --> 16:43.167
Angela! Angela, wake up!

16:44.703 --> 16:46.170
What the... Griffin?

16:46.172 --> 16:49.106
Angela, what the hell are you
doin' tryin' to kill yourself?

16:49.108 --> 16:52.142
Oh, why the hell did you
pull me out of there?

16:52.144 --> 16:54.011
You should've just
left me alone!

16:54.013 --> 16:56.080
That's how I'm gonna
end up, anyway.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.348
What are you talkin' about?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.716
I'm talking about the fact

16:58.718 --> 17:01.018
that I have nothing
to live for.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.052
Sure, you do.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.555
Someday, a white man's gonna
be elected president again.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.859
Griffin, I haven't been
with anyone in ten years.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.828
And when you spurned
my advances,

17:10.830 --> 17:12.029
it was a wake-up call.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.665
No one's ever gonna
love me again.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.499
Wait a minute.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.435
So that's why you been actin'
like such a wacky ass around me?

17:18.437 --> 17:21.505
It's been so long since
I've been with a man,

17:21.507 --> 17:23.907
I don't even remember
what it feels like.

17:23.909 --> 17:24.975
I always imagined
it felt very painful.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.878
You just sorta grit your teeth
and let us do what we want.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.049
I just wish one person was able
to find me attractive.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.419
That's not too much
to ask, is it?

17:35.421 --> 17:36.987
No...

17:36.989 --> 17:39.890
Look, Angela, I came
over here to punch you

17:39.892 --> 17:41.258
and maybe kick you
in the boob.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.794
But now I'm all
turned around.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.162
Angela? Angela?!

17:45.164 --> 17:46.363
Right here.
Oh.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.799
But now all I want to do
is help you out.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.701
I'll tell you what,
you know that ritzy,

17:50.703 --> 17:52.236
upscale place
over on Third?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.971
The Stuffy Fella?
That's it.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.540
You be at the Stuffy Fella
tonight around 9:00.

17:56.542 --> 18:01.145
I think I know someone
who might be perfect for you.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.455
Mmm, well, <i>hello.</i>

18:11.457 --> 18:12.423
Good evening, sir.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.893
I am Reginald New York
Knickerbocker, millionaire.

18:15.895 --> 18:16.860
(sniffing)

18:16.862 --> 18:19.029
Are you serving fish
this evening?

18:19.031 --> 18:19.863
No, sir.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.266
Then I believe
my guest has arrived.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.768
There she is!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.370
You must be Angela.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.306
Hi, are you Peter's
friend, Reginald?

18:29.308 --> 18:31.775
Mmm, indeed I am.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.313
Mmm, what a beautiful shade
of lipstick on those teeth.

18:36.315 --> 18:39.516
Oh, thank you, but that's
just my gums bleeding

18:39.518 --> 18:41.185
from aggressive gingivitis.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.787
Mmm, well,
your mouth is too sweet

18:43.789 --> 18:45.889
for your teeth
to want to stay in.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.224
(giggling): Oh.
Yes.

18:47.226 --> 18:50.294
Well, I-I'm just gonna
go to the powder room

18:50.296 --> 18:51.528
and freshen up.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.963
She's eatin' it up.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.533
This is easier than an American
finding his brother in China.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.302
Ron?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.770
Ron, where are you?

18:59.772 --> 19:00.871
Over here, Paul!

19:00.873 --> 19:02.372
Oh, good, there you are.

19:02.374 --> 19:03.774
It's pretty here.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.275
Yes, it is.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.249
Mmm, what a
wonderful dinner.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.984
Would you like
some dessert?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.352
Did you bake a pie?

19:15.354 --> 19:17.087
Well, there is a pie.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.289
It's been baking
since I met you.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.557
Mmm, gross.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.592
What?
Nothing.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.394
You know, Angela, there's
something I need to tell you.

19:24.396 --> 19:27.798
My doctor has given me
24 hours to live.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.599
Oh, my God!

19:28.601 --> 19:30.367
No, no, it's quite
all right.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.401
Because I vowed to myself

19:31.403 --> 19:33.637
that I would spend the
last night of my life

19:33.639 --> 19:37.141
in the company of the most
beautiful woman in the world.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.043
And that's just what
I have done.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.545
Oh, Reginald.

19:41.547 --> 19:42.613
No, no, no.

19:42.615 --> 19:46.216
This is already a perfect
end to a perfect evening.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.885
Good night, my dear.

19:47.887 --> 19:48.886
Reginald...

19:48.888 --> 19:51.221
I want you
to make love to me.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.356
Oh, if only I could,

19:52.358 --> 19:55.125
but I must to a Jew to put
my affairs in order.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.394
(sighs) I know
what's going on here.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.129
You don't want
to be with me.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.931
You're just like
everybody else.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.965
So-So go, then.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.434
I'm just gonna stay here
and kill myself.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.436
But you can't
kill yourself

20:06.438 --> 20:09.106
every time somebody won't
sleep with you.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.007
I won't.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.508
Just sleep with me
just this once,

20:11.510 --> 20:14.211
and it'll give me
everything I need.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.512
Sleep with me tonight.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.948
Save my life.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.354
Oh, that was fantastic!

20:24.356 --> 20:26.123
It was exactly
what I needed.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.526
Mmm, well, hopefully there'll
be no more talk of suicide.

20:29.528 --> 20:33.230
Oh, no. I feel better
than I've felt in years.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.032
I have my confidence again.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.335
I'm ready to go back out there
and meet someone.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.571
Well, I'm glad to
be of service.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.340
Oh, just one more thing
before you go.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.474
What's that, my dear?

20:44.476 --> 20:46.977
See you at work on
Monday, Griffin.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.979
Huh? Oh, I'm gonna
have to have a word

20:48.981 --> 20:52.249
with Rite-Aid about
this fake mustache.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.954
Well, I got my job back,
Angela's happy again,

20:56.956 --> 20:59.122
and she's not gonna
harass me anymore.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.624
Everything worked out
perfect.

21:00.626 --> 21:01.558
Not really, Peter.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.393
Yeah, you cheated
on your wife.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.028
No, I didn't.
I used Mort.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.531
Oh, my God,
I forgot about Mort!

21:07.533 --> 21:10.934
I want my two dollars!
