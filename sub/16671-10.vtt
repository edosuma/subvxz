00:08.360 --> 00:09.930
(tires screeching)

00:10.080 --> 00:12.606
- Welcome to the '80s, kid.
- We're in the '80s?

00:12.760 --> 00:14.524
If young me never reads
from that book,

00:14.680 --> 00:17.923
then evil will not plague my life,
and Pablo will be alive again.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.441
I haven't read from the book.
This can't be happening!

00:20.600 --> 00:21.931
Run!

00:24.160 --> 00:25.810
Who's there?
Henrietta.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.129
My husband,
he's found some Book of the Dead.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.124
Why am I here?
What the... fuck!

00:32.280 --> 00:35.523
So I read from the book,
and summoned the Kandarian Demon.

Ash:
Stop the Professor!

00:41.120 --> 00:43.168
(grunts)
I'm going to hurt you

00:43.320 --> 00:46.324
real bad.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.762
(crow cawing)

00:50.800 --> 00:53.770
You'll never get the Necronomicon.
(cackling)

00:54.760 --> 00:57.491
Poindexter, you get your ass
over here right now!

00:57.640 --> 00:59.688
Please forgive me!

01:00.640 --> 01:04.406
Oh, my God.
He just left with the book.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.801
No one escapes their destiny, Ash.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.127

- Yours is to watch me

01:10.280 --> 01:12.089
suck out your soul!

01:12.240 --> 01:14.368
Make sure you suck both barrels.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.010
Deadite Henrietta: Delicious,
but I couldn't possibly finish!

02:04.560 --> 02:06.449
Tanya: Help me!

02:07.200 --> 02:08.804
Please!
(sobbing)

02:08.960 --> 02:10.961
- I don't want to die!

02:11.120 --> 02:13.566
Come on, sweet cheeks.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.008
(wood creaking)

02:22.720 --> 02:25.371
(breathing heavily)
Help me!

02:35.720 --> 02:38.485
Oh, Ruby, it's you.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.405
Oh, great. You got the book.
Good job.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.362
- What's different about you?
- (shrieking)

02:46.560 --> 02:48.244
Whoa!
(grunting)

02:48.400 --> 02:51.006
Deadite Henrietta:
Ah, come here!

02:53.920 --> 02:56.366
- Whoa.
- Who are you?

02:57.560 --> 03:00.450
I'm you... from another time.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.521
What are you doing here?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.921
- I came for that.
- (faint whispering)

03:06.120 --> 03:07.531
And for Ash.
So where is he?

03:07.680 --> 03:09.569
- (growling, clattering in basement)
- Ash!

03:09.840 --> 03:12.571
(grunts)

03:12.720 --> 03:14.882
You're with him?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.482
Ah!

03:32.080 --> 03:35.801
How about some nice warm milk?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.962
- No!
- From Granny!

03:38.120 --> 03:39.963
No!

03:40.120 --> 03:43.044
No! No!

Prison rules, eh?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.641

03:53.800 --> 03:56.041
Ooh!

03:56.200 --> 03:58.441
Feels so good inside me!

04:03.560 --> 04:06.404

I'll rip your face off!

04:22.280 --> 04:23.327
Stay still!

04:26.400 --> 04:27.765
- Suck on this, bitch!

04:31.520 --> 04:34.524
Let go my face!
Is that all you got?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.364
- Fuck!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.884
Get ready, Ash!

Whee!

05:21.160 --> 05:24.482
- You're some kind of trick.
- No, the opposite.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.928
I'm the key to you getting
everything you ever wanted.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.969
All I ever wanted was this book,

05:30.120 --> 05:31.929
And your babies.
I know.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.010
Okay, well, that old bat
must've really rung my bell good,

two Ruby's fight now.</i>

05:49.960 --> 05:51.405
One too many.

Wait, this is your opportunity
to choose a new life.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.365
Oh, wait a second.
I know what's going on now.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.284
You're the '80s version of Ruby.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.442
Wow! That is trippy.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.886
Oh, here's a question.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.441
If we all had sex right now,
would it still be a threesome,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.250
'cause technically
you're both the same person?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.801
(chuckfing)

06:10.960 --> 06:14.646
Okay, well, either way, you should listen
to this Ruby, 'cause your future sucks.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
Your demon kids are going to betray
you for their demon dad.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.005
Then they're going to
make you kill 'em.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.571
- What?
- Yeah.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.529
Didn't see that coming, did you?
Trying to help.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.650
- (gasps)
- You kill my babies?

06:25.800 --> 06:27.131
But you don't have to.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.130
Don't you get it? You can walk away
with your immortality intact.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.767
- You can create a new future.
- What would I even do?

06:33.920 --> 06:37.367
Anything, you can do anything.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.761
Anything?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.162
- Oh!
<i>'</i> No!

06:45.160 --> 06:48.448

06:54.000 --> 06:56.606
Kelly: Ruby!

06:59.960 --> 07:02.566
She won't be down long.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.166
I'll do what I can,
but I want you to get out of here now.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.362
And just leave you here alone to die?!
I don't think so.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.965
No, we just need
to stop this bleeding.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.805
Kelly... stop.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.447
So, Ruby, does this mean I don't have to
pay back the 20 bucks I owe you?

07:17.600 --> 07:20.046
It's 200 bucks.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.850
(wheezing)

07:22.040 --> 07:24.930
I was wrong about you.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.360
You're an all right sort of person.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.363
Sort of.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.205
Well, and even though
you unleashed evil on the world,

07:33.360 --> 07:34.805
you didn't get in my way
while I cleaned it up,

07:34.960 --> 07:37.611
so I guess you're an okay half-demon,
half-person yourself.

- I'm not dead, you dumb bastard.
- Oh, wow.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.529
That was weird.
You were really still for a minute.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.365
Oh, Kelly... take it.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.604
You know what to do.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.081
And you go and forge that path,
all right?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.651
(wheezes)

08:10.320 --> 08:11.765

08:13.640 --> 08:15.927
I'll hold her off as long as I can.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.804
Holy hand!
Kelly, you see this?!

08:51.960 --> 08:54.167
I got a hand! It's real!

08:54.320 --> 08:57.403
It works!
It's magnificent!

08:59.360 --> 09:01.283
Too bad Pablo
couldn't be here to see this.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.125
No, Ash, don't you see
what this means?

09:04.280 --> 09:06.328
We changed history.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.682
It worked!

09:10.960 --> 09:12.041
Pablo!

09:20.040 --> 09:22.646
Wait a minute.
I was-- What is...

09:22.800 --> 09:25.246
What is...
what is happening?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.004
- What is going on?
- Well, you were dead.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.810
- Uh-huh.
- So, we went back in time,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.844
we changed history,
and now you're back alive.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.082
- Wait, I was dead?
- Oh, yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.322
Sunken eyes, horrible stench,
the whole nine yards.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.766
Welcome back, Pablito.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.844
- Wow.
- Yeah!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.571
Now that is
a firm handshake, Jefe!

09:44.720 --> 09:47.166
Crazy, huh?
Brand-spanking-new hand.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.322
Or, brand-new spanking hand?

09:49.520 --> 09:51.921
Hey, now...

09:52.080 --> 09:55.368
Wait, guys, where's Ruby?

10:02.480 --> 10:05.529
- She didn't make it, man.
- So, what, this other Ruby,

10:05.680 --> 10:09.526
the evil '80s Ruby,
she's just chilling at the cabin?

10:09.680 --> 10:12.365
Our Ruby was going to hold her off
for as long as she could, until...

10:12.520 --> 10:14.966
Can we change the subject
to something less depressing?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.407
Like, Pablo, maybe tell us
more about the time you died?

10:17.560 --> 10:18.766
Oh, yeah.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.445
It almost feels like
it happened to another me,

10:20.640 --> 10:22.483
but this me still knows about it.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.284
And in that moment,
right before I died,

10:24.440 --> 10:27.603
all I could think about was
how I wanted to save the world,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.364
and be a hero, like you.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.131
Well, you'll never really be like me,
'cause I'm a legal citizen,

10:32.280 --> 10:34.408
but you did help save the world.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.050
Kelly:
I hate to be a buzzkill,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.601
but we kind of need
to get back to the future.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.524
Without Ruby's help.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.770
Kelly, book me.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.288
Pablo, you think because
that book was inside you,

10:47.440 --> 10:48.885
some Sumerian rubbed off?

10:49.080 --> 10:51.560
Like enough to read from
the time travel passage in there?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.404
Don't you worry, Jefe.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.562
- I got this.
- (laughs)

10:55.720 --> 10:58.564
- I knew you could do it.
- Oh, yeah. I can do it, all right.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.569
Just don't know if I want to.
(sniffs)

11:00.760 --> 11:02.046
What?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.409
I said, "I don't want to."

11:06.920 --> 11:09.207
Hey, whoa, whoa!

11:09.360 --> 11:11.249

11:46.800 --> 11:48.484
Kelly.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.728
Are we back in Jacksonville?

in foreign language)

11:54.800 --> 11:56.404

12:08.800 --> 12:10.290

Mama.

Look who's awake.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.166
(Spawn growling)

12:14.320 --> 12:17.483
You mind telling me
what the Flying Dutchman is going on?

12:17.640 --> 12:20.883
We're course correcting,
rebuilding the family you tore apart.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.883
See, this era's Ruby
hasn't been exposed to you

12:23.040 --> 12:25.486
like the recently departed Ruby was.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.170
Hasn't betrayed me.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.925
Well, that's good.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.844
You found yourself a keeper.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.004
- Now, where the hell is my Pablo?
- Oh, it's hard to say.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.527
See, most cultures have
different names for the netherworld.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.809
The Aztecs called it Mictlan.
The Greeks, the Tartarus.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.166
You call it hell.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.011
None of it's correct,
but your tiny little minds

12:46.200 --> 12:48.043
cannot comprehend
the reality of the dimension

12:48.240 --> 12:49.844
that your friend
now finds himself in.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.844
- (shouting in Sumerian)
- You know, you almost had me.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.327
You really blocked off
all my options.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.323
Well, most of them, anyway.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.363
And it's not ideal
being inside a dead body,

13:01.520 --> 13:03.966
but it's not
an insurmountable challenge.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.210
- (cat screeching)
- Especially when all I had to do

13:07.360 --> 13:10.284
was convince the one man
foolish enough to swallow my chicanery

13:10.440 --> 13:13.046
if he went back in time,
he could resurrect his dead little friend.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.121
You flim-flamming S.O.B.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.009
You played me like a cheap fiddle.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.525
Oh, don't be so sore, Ash.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.330
There's no way you could've known.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.926
See, my transference
was one of those...

13:24.080 --> 13:25.605
blink and you'll miss it moments.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.206

13:31.600 --> 13:33.967
- Heard it all before, pal.
- That so?

13:34.160 --> 13:37.642
Yeah, demon powers, immortality,
jumping into people's bodies.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.768
Honestly,
I'm not impressed by that.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.725
Now, you strip that away,
give us a fair fight,

13:42.920 --> 13:46.208
- I'll bet I would kick your candy ass.
- Ignore him.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.408
Come on, buddy.
What do you say?

13:48.560 --> 13:51.040
A little mano a mano?
Test the mettle of man?

13:51.200 --> 13:52.929
That's what this is all about, right?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.764
I'm willing to throw in.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.129
But... and this is
a big, hairy but...

13:58.280 --> 14:00.089
you got to turn off
your demon powers.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.605
This has to be a fair fight.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.282
What do you hope
to achieve by this?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.444
If I win, you, Ruby,
your worthless kids,

14:09.600 --> 14:12.331
and all the other evil crap here
takes a freight train to the underworld,

14:12.480 --> 14:14.130
and I get my buddy Pablo back.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.760
Dark Ruby: And what do we get
when you lose?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.126
I don't know, toots.
What do you want?

14:18.280 --> 14:21.762
I want to rip the skies open
until they bleed.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.123
And the flood
to flush away humanity,

14:25.280 --> 14:29.285
and the Earth to burn
so that the flames touch the heavens.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.771
Is that it?

14:30.920 --> 14:32.968

to eat her.

you can trust this piece of shit
to keep his word?

when I came back here,

that we're past that now.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.442
Today is a new day,
and I want you to know...

29:28.200 --> 29:31.283
- I love this town.
- (cheering)

29:33.640 --> 29:37.850
So much so, I'm moving back here,
and this time it's for good!

29:38.040 --> 29:40.611
- (cheering)
- Yeah! That's right!

29:42.120 --> 29:46.045
Evil, if you show
your ugly mug in this town

29:46.200 --> 29:48.407
ever again...

29:48.560 --> 29:50.642
I will fuck you up,

29:50.800 --> 29:54.566
I will take you down,
and I will wipe you out!

29:54.720 --> 29:56.722
- (cheering)
- Yeah.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.210
I love you, Elk Grove!

30:00.400 --> 30:01.811
- (crowd chanting "Ash")
- I love you, Ash!

30:01.960 --> 30:04.327
- Hey, I love me, too!
- (band playing)

30:04.480 --> 30:05.891
Let's party!

30:18.320 --> 30:20.288
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.408
Wow, it's just that...

30:22.560 --> 30:25.404
all of this... it's so perfect.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.961
I mean,
I-l never expected any of this.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.566
Well, you deserve this, Ash.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.603
You've done your part.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.330
Now you can live a normal life.

30:34.480 --> 30:38.121
It's time you relax
and do whatever you want.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.328
Whatever I want?

30:40.520 --> 30:42.443
Ooh, I want some sugar!

31:11.280 --> 31:12.930
Whoo!

31:13.720 --> 31:15.722
(music playing)

31:54.760 --> 31:56.762
(music slows down)

32:09.760 --> 32:11.762
(wind blowing)

32:23.360 --> 32:25.362
(fly buzzing)

32:30.880 --> 32:33.963
Girl:
Hey, look what I found!
