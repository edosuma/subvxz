NARRATOR:
 Previously on East Los High.

00:02.236 --> 00:04.671
I didn't know about the drugs.
So the next time I call you,

00:04.738 --> 00:06.273
you answer the phone.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.175
No, baby, wait!
You guys still fighting?

00:08.242 --> 00:11.078
He was stupid,
but I was also a tease.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.547
I gotta talk to him.
Can I trust you?

00:13.614 --> 00:17.184
Of course you can.
 Por vida.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.088
FILIBERTA:
Tiffany, what did you do?

00:21.155 --> 00:23.056
What?
You just sent naked pictures

00:23.123 --> 00:24.691
of you and Diego to everyone.

00:24.758 --> 00:29.530
DIEGO: You okay?
You son of a bitch!

00:29.596 --> 00:31.698
We can create a safety plan.
You have to cut off

00:31.765 --> 00:33.367
all communication with
your boyfriend.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.169
I'll do it.
Damn, Ceci,

00:35.235 --> 00:36.436
is everything I do wrong?

00:36.503 --> 00:38.438
Can't you see
that I'm trying?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.409
I need a taxi right away.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.386
Where are you going?

00:52.452 --> 00:54.388
Get out of my way.
I'm outta here.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.523
Ceci, please.
Pedro, don't even think about

00:56.590 --> 00:58.292
touching me or Isela
or I'm calling 9-1-1.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.626
Pedro,
I said don't touch me!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.428
Ceci, please.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.363
I'm begging you.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.232
Don't leave me.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.234
I'm so sorry!

01:07.301 --> 01:09.269
Listen, I know
what I did was wrong.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.272
And I don't deserve you.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.209
I can't stay here anymore. I--

01:15.275 --> 01:16.777
( mumbling ):
Please, please just--

01:17.044 --> 01:20.013
Ceci, I'm so sorry.

01:22.049 --> 01:27.387
I never meant to hurt you,
baby, I swear to God.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.258
( sobbing ):
Don't go. Please don't go.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.101
CAMILA:
Gina, wake up.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.036
Come on,
we gotta go to school.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.706
Leave me alone.
I'm not going.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.475
You can't hide forever, mensa.
Come on, let's go.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.743
( phone dings )
 Andele.

01:51.378 --> 01:52.779
( dramatic theme playing )

01:53.046 --> 01:54.514
Look on the bright side.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.417
At least they're not
naked pictures of you.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.587
Shut up. Go away.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.389

02:05.158 --> 02:07.160

Hey, Gina. Date me,
I won't cheat on you.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.105
Leave her alone, stupid.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.440
All right, all right,
move aside,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.242
blind woman coming through.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.010
Go to hell.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.312
DIEGO:
Gina!

02:58.378 --> 03:00.781
Oh, hell no.
I'm sorry.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.150
Get the hell away from me!
Gina, please.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.451
Didn't you hear her?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.554
I loved you!
I believed you!

03:07.621 --> 03:09.156
I never wanna see your face

03:09.222 --> 03:11.391
ever again,
you lying piece of shit!

03:13.193 --> 03:14.728
You hurt her, pendejo.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.598
What are you looking at?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.500
( school bell rings )

03:28.508 --> 03:31.578
Gina, can I see you
in my office?

03:37.250 --> 03:40.287
I don't know about you,
but I feel better.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.089
Asshole.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.458
You can't blame
this one on your dad.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.462
GINA:
I'm so humiliated.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.730
I wanna get out of here.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.165
You can't drop out.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.102
I can get my GED on my own.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.037
Yeah, but you'd
be giving up so much.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.440
I mean, you're in the top
ten percent of your class.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.309
And what about Bomb Squad?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.444
You mean, Bomb Squad
with that ho, Tiffany?

04:04.511 --> 04:06.513
Gina.
And all the bitches that knew

04:06.580 --> 04:08.281
and never told me anything.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.350
Yeah, that Bomb Squad.
The same one

04:10.417 --> 04:14.521
that is working their butts off
to get to Regionals.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.157
That's the only reason
why I came to school today.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.660
I don't know
how much more I can take.

04:20.727 --> 04:22.796
Well, you're not gonna
have to because this school

04:23.063 --> 04:25.365
does not tolerate bullying
and I'm gonna make sure

04:25.432 --> 04:27.401
that everyone knows it.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.272
Good luck with that.

04:32.339 --> 04:36.209
MISS ALVAREZ ( over PA ):
 Attention, student body.
 Please listen up.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.211
( girl laughing )
 You have 24 hours to get those

04:38.278 --> 04:39.713
( man whistles )
photos off your phones,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.448
tablets and computers

04:41.515 --> 04:43.383
or you may be liable
for possession

04:43.450 --> 04:45.185
of underage pornography.

04:45.252 --> 04:49.289
We will not tolerate
taunting, bullying or shaming.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.092
If you wanted revenge,
you sure got it.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.561
I guess giving blow jobs isn't
the only thing you're good at.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.263
It was an accident.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.432
I was deleting pictures
because I'm done with you.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.333
Get the hell out of my face.
You came to talk to me!

05:00.400 --> 05:01.535
Now I'm done
talking to sluts.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.403
You're the slut,
asshole!

05:03.470 --> 05:06.339
What we did was wrong,
but at least I can admit it.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.449
So this is where
you've been hiding.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.784
I've been looking
all over for you.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.586
What for?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.488
To laugh at me?

05:22.589 --> 05:25.459
How long have you known?

05:25.525 --> 05:27.427
Since Homecoming.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.497
And you never told me?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.368
I just lost my virginity
to that asshole.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.238
I thought we were friends.

05:45.679 --> 05:50.484
TEACHER:
The story of Faust is about
an arrogant and ambitious man

05:50.550 --> 05:52.486
who makes a deal
with the devil,

05:52.552 --> 05:54.387
thinking that he can
outsmart him.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.156
( phone vibrates )

05:56.223 --> 06:00.060
But turns out that the devil
has other plans for Faust.

06:15.242 --> 06:18.078
You're rolling the Escalade
down to San Diego Friday.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.146
( Spanish hip-hop
playing over speakers )

06:21.615 --> 06:23.750
Fine.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.254
But this is the last time.
I don't wanna be part of this.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.491
You said you were down to do
whatever it takes to make it.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.562
Okay? You're done
when I say you're done.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.631
( tense theme playing )

06:40.200 --> 06:42.702
Now go get the keys.

07:12.961 --> 07:14.196
What are you doing?

07:16.431 --> 07:18.667
Homework.

07:18.734 --> 07:21.670
CAMILA:
At 5:30 in the morning?

07:21.737 --> 07:23.071
What do you care?

07:26.641 --> 07:28.677
I'm your sister.

07:28.744 --> 07:30.078
Of course I care.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.713
So now you're my sister?

07:31.780 --> 07:34.649
You never wanna talk to me
about anything real.

07:34.716 --> 07:36.051
Anytime I try
to ask you stuff--

07:36.118 --> 07:37.953
Gina, you don't have
to know everything.

07:38.020 --> 07:41.089
I'm so sick and tired
of nobody talking to me

07:41.156 --> 07:42.991
and everybody treating me
like a baby.

07:43.058 --> 07:46.695
So stop acting like one.

07:46.762 --> 07:49.898
Bad things happen
to all of us, Gina.

07:49.965 --> 07:52.968
You gotta be strong.

07:53.035 --> 07:54.669
You gotta move on.

07:57.472 --> 07:59.775
Don't worry. I am.

08:04.813 --> 08:06.181
CECI:
It was actually Pedro's idea

08:06.448 --> 08:08.083
to come in
for couple's counseling.

08:08.150 --> 08:10.652
I'm really proud of him.

08:10.719 --> 08:12.487
We're here
'cause I love my girl.

08:12.554 --> 08:14.589
We've been having some problems.

08:14.656 --> 08:17.125
What kind of problems?

08:17.192 --> 08:21.163
Well, sometimes I lose my cool.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.532
There's this coach that works
with Ceci and every time

08:23.598 --> 08:25.434
they're together--
Jacob's just a friend.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.103
Hold on, Ceci. We're gonna
get to that in a second.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.605
But why don't we
let Pedro finish first.

08:30.672 --> 08:33.742
All right, well...

08:33.809 --> 08:38.647
You see, when I picture them
around each other, I...

08:38.713 --> 08:41.616
I get so pissed off that...

08:41.683 --> 08:43.952
I lose my cool.

08:44.019 --> 08:45.787
What does that mean?

08:45.854 --> 08:47.489
"Lose your cool"?

08:48.590 --> 08:50.892
I get angry.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.462
We fight.

08:53.528 --> 08:55.430
Are you afraid
you're going to lose Ceci?

08:55.497 --> 08:56.631
PEDRO:
Ceci...

08:56.698 --> 08:58.767
is my life.

09:00.435 --> 09:02.938
I can't even imagine
living without her.

09:03.004 --> 09:05.540
I don't want to imagine
living without her.

09:05.607 --> 09:07.476
How does that make you feel?

09:07.542 --> 09:08.710
CECI:
Well, I...

09:08.777 --> 09:10.745
I liked it at first.

09:12.147 --> 09:15.851
Nobody's ever loved me before.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.854
I mean, I like him
being all protective, but...

09:20.655 --> 09:22.224
( clears throat )

09:23.592 --> 09:24.893
Go on.

09:26.194 --> 09:28.130
Nothing, I--

09:28.196 --> 09:30.198
I just want him to know

09:30.465 --> 09:33.201
that I'm his girl
and nobody else's.

09:34.836 --> 09:36.972
I love you, baby.

09:39.608 --> 09:41.543
You know that, right?

09:41.610 --> 09:43.745
PEDRO:
You see? We love each other.

09:43.812 --> 09:46.781
I know we do.

09:46.848 --> 09:49.451
This has been great,
you know, just...

09:49.518 --> 09:51.720
Just being able to
get this off my chest.

09:51.786 --> 09:54.189
I feel really good.
I feel a lot better, right?

09:54.456 --> 09:55.857
Do you?
Yeah, me too.

09:55.924 --> 09:57.993
See?

09:58.059 --> 09:59.227
Are we done?

09:59.494 --> 10:01.696
For today.

10:03.131 --> 10:05.200
See you both next time.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.178
Hey.

10:16.444 --> 10:18.880
What's up?

10:18.947 --> 10:20.882
What happened to you?

10:20.949 --> 10:22.717
I never heard back
from you yesterday.

10:22.784 --> 10:25.453
I had to take care
of some things.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.089
Oh, so it's gonna be
like that, huh?

10:28.156 --> 10:30.025
You gonna be keeping things
from me?

10:30.091 --> 10:32.227
I'm outta here.
Come on, chill.

10:32.494 --> 10:34.196
I'm dealing with
some heavy stuff right now.

10:34.462 --> 10:35.964
( somber theme playing )

10:37.766 --> 10:39.201
Is it Remy?

10:39.467 --> 10:42.137
Yeah.

10:42.204 --> 10:44.172
I'm quitting my internship.

10:44.439 --> 10:45.907
I'm tired of being his bitch.

10:45.974 --> 10:48.610
And I want you to quit too.

10:48.677 --> 10:51.546
Fine. I never liked that guy.

10:56.985 --> 10:59.020
I'm thinking about
going back to New York.

10:59.087 --> 11:01.489
I was hoping
you'd come with me.

11:03.158 --> 11:04.759
Really?

11:06.228 --> 11:07.929
What about Gina?

11:07.996 --> 11:11.066
She can come if she wants.

11:11.132 --> 11:12.601
Are you down?

11:15.170 --> 11:17.572
With you? Hell yeah.

11:21.676 --> 11:24.045
Hey.

11:24.112 --> 11:25.880
You okay?

11:33.054 --> 11:34.489
You know,
no matter what happens,

11:34.556 --> 11:36.558
I'll always love you,
right?

11:38.927 --> 11:40.695
Yeah.

FILIBERTA: Don't worry.

12:05.153 --> 12:06.821
It's just me.

12:06.888 --> 12:10.158
You're not gonna be able
to hide from Gina forever.

12:10.225 --> 12:13.128
Fili, I really screwed up.

12:15.797 --> 12:18.099
Don't tell me you're pregnant
with Diego's baby?

12:18.166 --> 12:20.635
I'm a week late.

12:20.702 --> 12:22.937
I was just about
to take the test.

12:23.004 --> 12:24.506
After all the advice
I've given you,

12:24.572 --> 12:26.141
you still had unprotected sex
with him?

12:26.207 --> 12:27.542
No, I didn't.

12:27.609 --> 12:29.577
He always pulled out.

12:29.644 --> 12:31.680
Pulling out is not enough.

12:31.746 --> 12:32.914
You should've made him bag it.

12:32.981 --> 12:35.450
I tried.

12:35.517 --> 12:39.454
But he didn't want to.
And it's not romantic.

12:39.521 --> 12:41.823
Oh, but peeing on a stick
in the girl's bathroom is?

12:41.890 --> 12:43.658
( sighs )

12:44.959 --> 12:46.494
Come on.

12:46.561 --> 12:48.129
Just go pee already.
( door opens )

12:48.196 --> 12:50.131
CECI:
Tiffany, Fili, come on!

12:50.198 --> 12:52.033
You're late for practice!

12:52.100 --> 12:53.735
( door closes )
Just do it later.

12:58.106 --> 13:00.642
CECI:
Listen, I know there's been

13:00.709 --> 13:02.477
a lot of drama lately,

13:02.544 --> 13:05.513
and everybody's got
their chonies in a bunch.

13:05.580 --> 13:09.084
But do you really think those
Truman Tramps give a shit?

13:09.150 --> 13:10.952
Hell, no!

13:11.019 --> 13:13.588
So let's bring it, ladies.

13:17.692 --> 13:20.495
( dance music
playing over stereo )

13:32.607 --> 13:33.808
Watch it!

13:33.875 --> 13:35.877
Sorry, it was an accident.

13:35.944 --> 13:38.546
Just like how you "accidentally"
screwed my boyfriend?

13:38.613 --> 13:40.648
Well, someone had to.

13:41.716 --> 13:43.551
TIFFANY:
Unh! Stop!

13:43.618 --> 13:45.553
FILIBERTA:
Don't! Don't!

13:45.620 --> 13:47.622
She might be pregnant.

13:47.689 --> 13:48.957
What?

13:49.023 --> 13:51.126
And it's probably
Diego's baby.

13:51.192 --> 13:54.863
Jasmine, shut up.
WOMAN: Damn.

13:54.929 --> 13:56.097
CECI:
Gina, where are you going?

13:56.164 --> 13:58.133
Wait, Gina, come back!

13:58.199 --> 14:00.802
You can all go to hell.
I quit.

14:07.675 --> 14:09.677
Hey, Joss, listen up.

14:09.744 --> 14:11.579
I gotta talk to you about Remy.

14:11.646 --> 14:14.783
Oh,
now you're talking to me.

14:14.849 --> 14:17.051
This is serious.

14:17.118 --> 14:19.220
You know, I been thinking.

14:19.487 --> 14:22.223
Why would Amber's journal
be inside Remy's desk?

14:22.490 --> 14:24.559
Stop it, Sherlock.

14:24.626 --> 14:26.127
If there is a journal,
show it to me

14:26.194 --> 14:27.695
and we'll take it
to the police.

14:27.762 --> 14:30.899
( phone vibrates )
Why you gotta be like that?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.636
Hey, Veronica,
what's up?

14:34.702 --> 14:37.205
I gotta take this.

14:37.472 --> 14:39.841
Yeah, I'm great.
How are you?

14:42.043 --> 14:43.511
( mutters sarcastically )

14:43.578 --> 14:44.746
Whatever.

14:44.813 --> 14:46.214
( ominous theme playing )

14:46.481 --> 14:47.949
( phone ringing )

14:50.685 --> 14:52.520
Yeah, Remy. What's up?

14:52.587 --> 14:53.755
REMY ( over phone ):
 Yo.

14:53.822 --> 14:55.890
I got people waiting for you.

14:55.957 --> 14:57.792
Do not screw this up.

14:57.859 --> 15:01.663
You call me when you get
to San Diego. Got it?

15:01.729 --> 15:04.132
( dramatic theme playing )

15:14.008 --> 15:16.010
LORENA:
 Hola, mija.

15:16.077 --> 15:19.113
Mom.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.182
I just came to borrow
Camila's black tube top.

15:21.449 --> 15:23.518
( speaking in Spanish )
Church?

15:23.585 --> 15:25.920
Yes, in Nogales.

15:25.987 --> 15:28.957
Your tia abuela
Beatriz passed away.

15:30.725 --> 15:31.926
Who?

15:31.993 --> 15:33.127
Don't worry about it.

15:33.194 --> 15:34.996
I'm going to go pay my respects.

15:35.063 --> 15:37.532
Plus, I heard that she
might have left us a little

15:37.599 --> 15:40.134
something-something in her will.

15:40.201 --> 15:42.837
Um, how long
are you gonna be gone for?

15:42.904 --> 15:44.706
Just a couple of days.

15:44.772 --> 15:47.709
How are you doing, mija?

15:47.775 --> 15:49.010
It's been kinda--

15:49.077 --> 15:50.678
Oh, found it.

15:50.745 --> 15:52.113
Okay, I'm really glad
we had this talk.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.148
Mwah.

15:57.552 --> 15:59.554
( ominous theme playing )

16:09.664 --> 16:11.132
ERIC:
Here you go, guys.
Here you go.

16:11.199 --> 16:12.600
All right, here's yours.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.102
If you guys need anything
just let me know.

16:14.168 --> 16:15.703
Hey, I'm gonna go on break.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.438
What? You just got here.

16:17.505 --> 16:20.008
See you in 15.

16:20.074 --> 16:22.510
Hey, you forgot your phone.

16:22.577 --> 16:24.979
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:44.165 --> 16:46.668
Hey, where are you?
We have couples therapy today.

16:46.734 --> 16:48.469
PEDRO ( over phone ):
 Baby, I am so sorry,

16:48.536 --> 16:49.871
but I can't make it.

16:49.938 --> 16:51.673
I mean,
we're short a couple salesmen.

16:51.739 --> 16:53.608
I can't leave the floor.
Pedro, you promised.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.710
I know, I know. And I really
wanna go, but I can't, babe.

16:55.777 --> 16:57.512
I-I can't leave
these dudes alone.

16:57.579 --> 16:59.614
J-Just do me a favor,
just call and cancel.

16:59.681 --> 17:01.182
I can't cancel,
I'm already here.

17:01.449 --> 17:03.084
Of course you can cancel,
Ceci.

17:03.151 --> 17:06.220
I don't want you two ladies
talking smack behind my back.

17:06.487 --> 17:10.224
Hey, babe, I gotta go.
I love you, babe, bye.

17:13.528 --> 17:16.931
MAN: Can I get another beer?
WOMAN: Sure, coming right up.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.070
I'm glad you didn't
cancel our session, Ceci.

17:22.136 --> 17:23.905
Yeah, just don't tell Pedro.

17:23.972 --> 17:27.041
He was afraid that we'd talk
about him behind his back.

17:27.108 --> 17:30.078
You always seem so concerned
with making sure Pedro's happy.

17:30.144 --> 17:31.779
CECI:
Yeah, I'm his girlfriend.

17:31.846 --> 17:35.049
Just trust me,
it's not good when he's...

17:35.116 --> 17:36.884
JANET:
What?

17:37.986 --> 17:39.153
Ceci,

17:39.220 --> 17:41.623
has Pedro ever hit you?

17:43.191 --> 17:45.059
No.

17:49.497 --> 17:50.698
Okay...

17:50.765 --> 17:52.467
once.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.569
Just swear you won't
tell him I told you though.

17:54.636 --> 17:59.440
Everything you say here
is confidential.

17:59.507 --> 18:02.477
JANET:
Tell me about the time
that he hit you.

18:03.945 --> 18:06.648
It was no big deal, I mean...

18:06.714 --> 18:08.650
He was just jealous.

18:08.716 --> 18:11.686
He saw me talking
to my friend Jacob at school.

18:11.753 --> 18:13.921
What was Pedro
doing at the school?

18:13.988 --> 18:18.559
Oh, he-- He shows up
and surprises me sometimes.

18:18.626 --> 18:19.861
JANET:
And that's okay with you?

18:19.927 --> 18:21.095
Yeah.

18:21.162 --> 18:23.431
Yeah, h-he's been doing
a lot better

18:23.498 --> 18:25.633
since he's been coming here.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.602
Good.

18:27.669 --> 18:29.904
But Pedro has a long way to go.

18:29.971 --> 18:32.040
He still hasn't said
that he hit you.

18:35.076 --> 18:37.679
JANET:
It was just once...

18:37.745 --> 18:39.814
that he hit you, right?

18:43.084 --> 18:45.019
Ceci.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.588
The jealousy,
the checking up on you,

18:47.655 --> 18:49.490
the hitting.

18:49.557 --> 18:51.059
That's all...

18:51.125 --> 18:55.463
behavior commonly seen in
domestic violence situations.

18:55.530 --> 18:58.700
In these cases we recommend
individual counseling.

18:58.766 --> 19:01.969
Where each party can speak,
openly and safely.

19:02.036 --> 19:04.739
No, Pedro's not going
to come alone.

19:04.806 --> 19:07.742
I am not concerned
about Pedro right now.

19:07.809 --> 19:10.678
I'm more concerned about you
and your daughter's safety.

19:17.719 --> 19:19.921
I'm gonna help you, okay?

19:19.987 --> 19:21.723
Okay.

19:25.827 --> 19:27.929
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:57.225 --> 19:59.527
REMY:
Oh, you little bitch.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.902
JACOB:
Where the hell's Gina?

20:07.969 --> 20:09.604
She went on break
and never came back.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.506
WOMAN:
Thank you.

20:11.572 --> 20:12.874
Well, call her.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.575
Can't, she freaking left
her phone behind

20:14.642 --> 20:16.577
and got in a weird van.

20:16.644 --> 20:19.647
Shit.
Doesn't sound like her.

20:19.714 --> 20:21.749
Well, call around
and I'll cover for you.

20:23.084 --> 20:24.986
How can I help you?
