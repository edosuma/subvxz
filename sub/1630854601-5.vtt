WEBVTT

00:00.348 --> 00:02.785
Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:02.785 --> 00:03.916
Who'’s on service right now?

00:03.916 --> 00:05.222
It'’s you two, right?

00:05.222 --> 00:06.571
No, I'’m here to assist
with the deck.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.399
We'’re all on
service, technically.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.618
We'’re all on service, that's
what I was going to say.

00:09.618 --> 00:10.401
Got it.

00:10.401 --> 00:11.663
We'’re all on service.

00:11.663 --> 00:14.101
You can'’t stand around.
and not do sh--.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.582
Just asking Katie
if she likes Ross.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.640
That'’s----ed up.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.816
See if I can get out there
without embarrassing anyone.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.383
That'’s fine.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.516
The left side of my body,
I don'’t feel anything.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.083
Oh, [bleep].

00:40.083 --> 00:43.652
I expected a lot more progress
than I'’m experiencing.

00:43.652 --> 00:46.698
As you guys know,
I'’ve been struggling.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.265
So I'’ve made a decision.

01:00.538 --> 01:05.195
As you guys know, I'’ve been
struggling with my mobility.

01:05.195 --> 01:08.329
So I made a decision
to leave the boat.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.635
- What?
- Oh, cap.

01:10.635 --> 01:13.812
My mind'’s there.
My heart'’s there.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.250
My body just won'’t cooperate.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.425
I'’ve never quit.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.081
And this time, I have to.

01:22.256 --> 01:26.042
I finally gave myself
a plane ticket home.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.609
But it'’s round trip.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.611
I'’m going to go back
to the States,

01:29.611 --> 01:31.830
get this straightened out,
and as soon as I do,

01:31.830 --> 01:33.789
I'’ll be on the first plane
back here and

01:33.789 --> 01:36.748
tell whoever'’s on board
to get the [bleep] off my boat.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.187
So I apologize.

01:42.798 --> 01:47.672
I probably overstayed longer
than I should have,

01:47.672 --> 01:49.239
but...

01:50.719 --> 01:53.591
I'’m pretty
- ing stubborn.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.593
If anybody hadn'’t noticed that.

01:55.593 --> 02:00.424
It'’s the right decision
because I am no longer an asset.

02:00.424 --> 02:03.210
I am a liability right now
for the crew.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.820
I'’m going to hold them back.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.388
And that hurts
That cuts me right to my core.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.174
It'’s brutal.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.654
I'’ll be leaving today.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.178
The relief captain will be
here this afternoon.

02:15.178 --> 02:19.226
So thank you for
putting up with me and...

02:19.226 --> 02:21.402
Y'’all got work to do.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.447
Let'’s get after it. Okay?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.365
I'’m big on always doing
the right thing,

02:28.365 --> 02:29.758
no matter how difficult it is.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.629
That'’s what I
preach to the crew.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.414
If I'’m not going
to do it myself,

02:33.414 --> 02:35.807
I don'’t have any right to say
that to somebody else.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.723
So I have to.

02:41.726 --> 02:44.903
Nah, I'’m going to get packed
in a few minutes.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.078
- Okay.
- All right, honey.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.558
Okay, I love you.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.262
Come here.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.314
You'’ve got to make this
season for him, okay?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.448
I love Captain Lee
and I feel really sad

03:07.448 --> 03:09.493
that he'’s not
going to be here.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.713
All we'’re doing is going to
be for him, okay?

03:13.541 --> 03:14.846
Okay.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.501
He'’s suffering
far more than we are, okay?

03:20.852 --> 03:23.855
He needs to go home,
and he needs to get better.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.162
We need to make sure
that we still

03:26.162 --> 03:27.685
perform as if
Captain Lee'’s here

03:27.685 --> 03:31.298
and make him proud, because
that'’s what he deserves.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.083
Everything we do,
we just got to think about

03:34.083 --> 03:35.258
doing it for captain.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.480
I love you.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.569
I think you'’re missing something.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.397
- My----ing radio again?
- Nope.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.789
Where is that----ing thing?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.835
You know who'’s got it?

03:48.010 --> 03:49.229
No!

03:52.580 --> 03:55.670
That is not how I'’m going
to leave you in this vessel.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.107
That is not your
last memory of me.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.282
Do you understand me, Captain?

03:59.282 --> 04:01.110
I do understand you, sir.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.851
Captain, you'’ve been...

04:05.419 --> 04:07.116
more than you can know

04:07.116 --> 04:09.553
hugely helpful to all of us.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.600
We'’re going to do everything
we can this season for you.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.689
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

04:14.689 --> 04:15.646
Thank you, sir.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.869
Right. Well, this is going to
be exciting, isn'’t it?

04:20.869 --> 04:22.523
New captain.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.351
That could be a disaster, too,
because when I looked at Ross

04:24.351 --> 04:26.570
the first time, I was like,
Oh, God.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.093
- And then it just...
- We'’re screwed.

04:28.093 --> 04:33.882
Devolved and developed
into a burning in your body.

04:33.882 --> 04:36.493
I hope the new captain'’s as
sexy as Captain Lee.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.581
It'’s not possible.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.061
<i>Interior. Interior. Fraser.</i>

04:39.061 --> 04:41.716
<i>Can we all meet in the main
saloon, please?</i>

04:41.716 --> 04:42.847
<i>Copy, we'’re headed up now.</i>

04:42.847 --> 04:45.197
Deck team,
start the process.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.287
Are you the new captain?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.856
- Hi, ladies.
- Hello.

04:51.856 --> 04:55.164
Just because Captain is going
for a brief moment,

04:55.164 --> 04:57.079
he'’s going to be back.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.559
It'’s okay.

04:58.559 --> 05:02.693
Like, everything you do.
I want you to think of him.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.305
Every little----ing fight
you have between each of you,

05:05.305 --> 05:06.610
any----ing thing you
say to each other,

05:06.610 --> 05:09.265
think about really
how important that is.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.571
Let'’s put our hands in together.

05:10.571 --> 05:11.702
Sweaty, dirty hands.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.356
Feel that disgustingness?

05:13.356 --> 05:15.140
Because that'’s the hard work
we'’re going to put

05:15.140 --> 05:16.359
through in this season. Yeah?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.578
Now [bleep] off and
get this boat

05:17.578 --> 05:19.319
back up to where
it needs to be.

05:24.019 --> 05:24.976
What'’s going on?

05:24.976 --> 05:26.021
How are you?

05:26.021 --> 05:27.370
I'’m well.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.285
What are you doing with
Ross, the Troublemaker?

05:29.285 --> 05:30.765
Obviously, you saw us
in the hot tub.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.593
He tried to kiss me
multiple times.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.768
Did you kiss last night,
you guys?

05:33.768 --> 05:34.812
Oh, yeah.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.820
But like, Katie
obviously is into him.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.562
Eww.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.042
What do you mean, eww?
That'’s----ing sick.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.783
No, I talking about for Ben
to go and, kiss me.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.394
And you wonder why
she walked off upset?

05:54.789 --> 05:55.964
How are you?

05:55.964 --> 05:57.574
Firing on all cylinders?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.489
You just wanna make sure
that thing doesn'’t kill me.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.145
- I know you might.
- Just kidding.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.451
Just kidding. Just kidding.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.627
I was upset last night,
but it is what it is.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.106
What, are you going to ruin
the rest of your trip

06:08.106 --> 06:11.458
because, you know,
two people drunkenly made out?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.982
Ross said his
connection was with me.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.462
And so I'’m not worried.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.767
I really don'’t care.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.335
- Will you hold this?
- Is that my punishment?

06:19.335 --> 06:20.989
No, you'’re still
on my sh---list.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.991
I don'’t know who these are.
They were in my clothes, so...

06:22.991 --> 06:25.776
Do you want me
to show you how to...

06:25.776 --> 06:26.734
No!

06:29.127 --> 06:30.477
Like how to fold them properly?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.348
- Don'’t throw them away.
- I know how to fold.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.871
I'’ve been in here
the whole time.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.395
You can'’t throw people's stuff
away, babe.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.396
Yes, I can.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.441
Literally, what an idiot.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.964
This is stressing me out.
I need a shower.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.792
It that how that'’s
supposed to go?

06:46.231 --> 06:48.843
Oh!

06:48.843 --> 06:50.453
Hey-oh.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.846
Walk-a-tah!

06:51.846 --> 06:54.718
Camille is an issue
I see her not doing sh--.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.503
I literally
have been ignoring it

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
and she has one more charter
for me to ignore

06:58.461 --> 07:01.421
before I turn around and----ing
punch her in the----ing face

07:01.421 --> 07:02.857
because I'’m getting upset.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.903
We are.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.298
No, thanks. We'’re kind of upset.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.386
Talk to me about it.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.387
No, thanks.
Not right now.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.737
Maybe later.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.391
It'’s not up to you.
Maybe after...

07:15.391 --> 07:18.438
I'’m literally doing everything
I can to do it right.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.050
She came out of the laundry room

07:22.050 --> 07:24.052
and told me
how to do the laundry.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.663
Everybody'’s literally
is like she'’s so lazy.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.056
Like, can she please
pick up the pace?

07:28.056 --> 07:30.101
I'’m lazy?
I need to pick up the pace.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.929
- I'’m lazy.
- Yeah, if we'’re being honest.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.191
Bro, what?

07:33.191 --> 07:34.236
Can we just talk about it--

07:34.236 --> 07:37.108
I'’m going as fast as I can.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.370
We need somebody faster.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.242
Okay, then you
- ing do it.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.373
If you could do my job.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.202
I can do
your job and better.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.248
Guys, please don'’t.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.077
If I was classless
like yourself, I would be--

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
You'’re the one screaming
talking about class

07:51.514 --> 07:53.429
you with your pussy out
all night.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.040
She'’s off her
- ing rockers, bra.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.914
And it sucks
cause he'’s a good captain.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.568
I would love him to
be out on deck,

08:01.568 --> 08:05.441
but having the freedom to
have space to breathe

08:05.441 --> 08:07.356
is also very useful for us.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.618
Whoever comes on
as the next captain

08:08.618 --> 08:10.881
has got big boots to fill.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.450
There are good captains and
there are not so good captains.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.712
It'’s a lottery out there.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.714
Who knows what the
next captain will bring?

08:17.714 --> 08:19.673
Yeah, no kidding.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.636
Relieved of duty.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.557
Wow.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.951
Hi.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.136
Wow.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.355
Hi.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.661
How you doing, Captain?

08:51.661 --> 08:53.228
- Sorry.
- Thanks for coming.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.233
I appreciate
you coming on a such notice,

08:58.233 --> 09:00.931
and I'’ll do my best
to get back as quickly as I can.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.977
- And relieve you.
- Yeah.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.283
Captain Sandy really did me
a solid by stepping in.

09:05.283 --> 09:09.026
She inherits somebody
else'’s crew, and it's not easy.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.985
Your crew is very competent.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.553
I don'’t anticipate you're going
to have any issues at all.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.207
- I'’m really sorry.
- It happens.

09:16.207 --> 09:20.037
Let'’s go ahead
and make the sign off in there.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.735
And there.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.214
Captain Lee and I go way back.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.086
So when I heard about
Captain Lee'’s situation,

09:25.086 --> 09:26.653
I felt terrible.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.699
Who wants to leave because
you can'’t physically do it?

09:29.699 --> 09:32.049
My hope is that
Captain Lee feels supported.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.616
I'’m here
to take care of his boat

09:33.616 --> 09:35.139
and his crew
until he comes back.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.707
It'’ll be here when you get back.
So go get better.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.709
Thank you.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.276
<i>Deck crew, deck crew.</i>

09:41.276 --> 09:43.757
<i>Could I get some assistance
with my luggage?</i>

09:43.757 --> 09:45.019
- Let'’s all go.
- Copy that.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.237
On the way.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.891
<i>All crew, can we
go to the aft deck?</i>

09:47.891 --> 09:49.284
- Thanks, guys.
- That'’s okay.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.981
Any time, cap.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.475
Anyone know where
Camille'’s gone?

10:06.475 --> 10:08.129
Don'’t ya'll have
something better to do

10:08.129 --> 10:10.000
than hang out here
on the aft deck?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.480
No.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.004
- Thanks, everybody.
- Thank you.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.354
Hold it together
till I get back.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.878
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.184
Make me proud of you.
I already am.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.231
- I'’ll see everybody later.
- Thank you.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.319
Feel better soon.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.629
I can'’t tell you
how hard it is.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.677
That'’s just like an emptiness
that I'’ve never known.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.636
I will put in the work.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.768
I will deal with the pain.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.640
I am going to come back

10:40.640 --> 10:42.293
and finish what I started

10:44.339 --> 10:45.601
Come back.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.690
- Bye.
- Thank you, everyone.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.126
Let'’s go.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.737
- Bye, Captain.
- Bye.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.391
- See you soon.
- See you soon.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.483
As captain would say,
back to work now, guys.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.833
All right.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.236
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.194
You just missed captain.

11:13.194 --> 11:16.240
Yeah. I was busy
be----ed with.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.894
What do you mean?

11:17.894 --> 11:19.635
- Just getting----ed with.
- What do you mean?

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
By Alissa. I'’m lazy.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.204
And all three of you
guys have noticed.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.989
- When has this happened?
- Just now.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.731
Well, we can
talk about that after.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.733
- Come here.
- Okay.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.738
I feel like the more sleep
I get, the more tired I am.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.827
Nothing to do with the prosecco
from last night?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.742
No, actually,
I feel amazing.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.396
All crew, all crew.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.050
<i>This is your temporary captain.</i>

11:43.050 --> 11:45.748
<i>Can you meet me in the sky
lounge in five minutes?</i>

11:45.748 --> 11:47.271
Galley copies.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.709
<i>All right, cap.</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:52.537
Really, really good.
Really, really good.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.495
Here it is.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.367
Is anybody else nervous?

11:56.367 --> 11:57.978
- Yes.
- Yeah.

11:57.978 --> 12:01.024
- Hi.
- Hello, Captain.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.723
- All smiles.
- Welcome.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.550
So, I'’m Captain Sandy.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.379
It'’s never easy like, taken
over for another captain.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.598
Hopefully he gets better

12:09.598 --> 12:11.208
and he comes back
and takes over his boat

12:11.208 --> 12:12.688
and you guys.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.864
- Yeah.
- Well, when a new captain

12:14.864 --> 12:17.780
steps on, things
change, right?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.695
So I run a boat
how I run a boat.

12:19.695 --> 12:23.133
My experience on yachts,
dates back many, many years ago.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.569
I started on small boats.

12:24.569 --> 12:27.050
I went to engineering school,
captain school.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.662
I started in the Caribbean
and then I went off to the Med.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.751
We'’re not going there.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.056
Is she getting in there?

12:33.056 --> 12:34.623
<i>We have one meter
on our port.</i>

12:34.623 --> 12:35.972
Hey, Captain,
that was cool, man.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.539
What an absolute boss.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.671
I'’ve seen storms, fires.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.805
Pirates were on their way
and a warship rescued us.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.328
Fights, meltdowns.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.635
I understand
how hard the job can be.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.116
End of the day, I'’m here
because I love what I do.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.900
Let'’s show Captain Lee

12:50.900 --> 12:53.381
that we'’re going
to be our best selves

12:53.381 --> 12:55.078
until he gets back.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.646
All right, after this if you,
we can meet in the bridge.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.343
Brilliant.
Thank you so much.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.301
Thank you.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.784
- Hi, I'’m Ross.
- Nice to meet you.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.742
I heard you'’re,
like, incredible.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.265
Oh, let'’s not start from there.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.180
Yeah, like you
have great experience,

13:10.180 --> 13:13.444
and I'’m going to be able to rest
knowing you have experience

13:13.444 --> 13:15.882
Anyway, so you'’re going
to decide who'’s on

13:15.882 --> 13:17.927
anchor watch from 12 to 8.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.059
That way they learn.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.625
I want them to learn

13:20.625 --> 13:22.976
and feel the responsibility
and what it'’s like.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.980
And one day they will be
in command on a bridge.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.156
When Captain Lee was here,
the engineers were

13:29.156 --> 13:31.941
nicely stepping in and doing
the anchor watches for us.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.117
Just make sure everybody
gets their proper rest.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.032
It'’s not the best news
I want to hear,

13:36.032 --> 13:37.642
but I respect the captain.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.296
We'’ll do what we can
and we'’ll make it work.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.429
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, it'’s a pleasure.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.430
Get to it.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.218
- Hi.
- Hi, Captain.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.611
- How are you?
- Good.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.004
I want to see the crew area.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.048
- Just so I can...
- You want to see the crew area?

13:52.048 --> 13:53.397
Here, I'’ll take you down.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.965
This is my first tour
of this boat.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.533
There'’s a stew refrigerator
and a pantry

13:58.533 --> 13:59.708
also behind you.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.362
Working with Captain Lee,

14:01.362 --> 14:03.625
there'’s a peace of mind
knowing that we already have

14:03.625 --> 14:06.933
this well-oiled machine
with our relationship together.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.239
Drinks, laundry.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.633
Now we have a different
dynamic coming in.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.722
We'’re going to have to
get together to figure out

14:13.722 --> 14:16.507
how we'’re actually going to be
cohesive together on the boat.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.162
- And then the crew kitchen
- This is really nice.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.816
This is like someone'’s
living room.

14:20.816 --> 14:21.817
Yeah.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.167
Sh--.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.168
My God.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.345
it.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.656
So we want all those
flatbeds to come up.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.700
- Yeah.
- All that.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.354
Not leaving any fun for me.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.269
I just wanted to bring you
all together and say, you know,

14:39.269 --> 14:41.358
thank you very much for all
the hard work you'’re putting in.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.144
And so I would
like to award Ben.

14:44.144 --> 14:47.103
- Hey!
- The Golden deck brush.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.584
Yay!

14:49.584 --> 14:51.934
If you would like
to kneel down, please.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.283
And with this golden deck brush,

14:53.283 --> 14:56.330
the title of
lead deckhand.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.985
Yay!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.203
Yeah, Benjamin!

15:00.203 --> 15:02.118
- There you go.
- Nice.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.598
I'’m excited to be a
lead deckhand.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.165
I suppose I like being
in charge, being a leader.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.775
I'’ve done a lot team
sports growing up.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.342
I was a swimmer for ten years.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.692
Competitive swimming so being
a leader is like just

15:10.692 --> 15:12.041
in blood, I'’m pretty sure.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.130
Captain wants us to now
cover anchor watches,

15:14.130 --> 15:16.350
but we are going to
get two hour breaks

15:16.350 --> 15:17.612
in the middle of the day.

15:17.612 --> 15:18.743
Shower time.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.744
Thank you very much, guys.

15:19.744 --> 15:20.745
- Woo!
- Yeah.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.833
- Nice.
- All right.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.531
Ross, Fraser, Rachel.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.663
<i>Meet me in the crew mess
for preference sheet meeting.</i>

15:25.663 --> 15:29.885
- Copy that.
- Copy.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.278
Hello?

15:31.278 --> 15:34.150
Wow. I have to learn
my way around this thing.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.804
I don'’t know if you guys
are into tennis or golf,

15:35.804 --> 15:39.721
but Gigi Fernandez is a
two time Olympic gold medalist

15:39.721 --> 15:42.419
who is in the International
Tennis Hall of Fame

15:42.419 --> 15:45.596
and has won 17
Grand Slam titles.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.904
I think it'’s pretty cool we
have a gold medalist on board.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.384
Yeah.
This is gonna be cool.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.039
Gigi being a two time
gold medal winning champion

15:53.039 --> 15:54.605
is fascinating.

15:54.605 --> 15:57.217
There'’s so much drive,
so much effort.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.827
I have such respect for that.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.264
She will also be joined
by her wife, Jane Geddes,

16:01.264 --> 16:03.092
a former professional golfer
who has won

16:03.092 --> 16:04.572
the women'’s U.S. Open dinner.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.704
Dinner for night one is a
full celebration of

16:06.704 --> 16:08.271
the primary'’s birthday.

16:08.271 --> 16:12.362
Dinner decor should all have
a consistent Puerto Rican theme.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.103
Guests request
an excursion on land

16:14.103 --> 16:16.279
for an afternoon of
tennis and tequila.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.107
This is going to be
really, really fun.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.848
So this is map of the island.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.806
So the first night
we'’re going right here

16:21.806 --> 16:23.286
to anchor off the Pitons.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.462
Last time I was in
the Caribbean was 2014.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.551
It'’s so great to be back.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.118
I love Saint Lucia.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.990
- Oh, brilliant.
- Wouldn'’t that be great?

16:30.990 --> 16:34.123
The Pitons are magnificent.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.690
The fact that you can
anchor right off of them

16:35.690 --> 16:38.301
and you look up
and they'’re massive.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.564
It'’s feels like Jurassic Park.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.827
I'’m sad about Captain Lee,
but I'’m really happy.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.525
You guys seem really into this.

16:44.525 --> 16:45.613
Thank you.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.528
- Thank you.
- And thanks for coming.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.617
I'’m done.
I'’m----ing done.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.489
- Hey, Fraser.
- Yeah?

16:54.274 --> 16:58.365
This was in the trash upstairs,
just like that.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.019
It was Camille
doing that earlier.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.110
- It'’s going to continue
- Yeah, I know.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.546
My biggest issue with Camille

17:05.546 --> 17:08.331
is that the work ethic
is lacking enormously.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.680
- Who put that there?
- Camille?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.378
We might actually have
to get you to move,

17:11.378 --> 17:12.857
because I think I'’m going
to try to tidy this.

17:12.857 --> 17:16.252
Do you see this space
where more bottles can go?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.862
Maybe you could grab it.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.126
It'’s not working.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.605
I'’m going to sort this out.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.520
I don'’t have a plan,
to be honest with you,

17:23.520 --> 17:26.741
but I'’m going to hope
that it just comes to me soon.

17:26.741 --> 17:27.829
It will.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.093
Coming up...

17:31.093 --> 17:33.182
You know what'’s hilarious,
you guys?

17:33.182 --> 17:34.618
That I'’m drinking again,

17:34.618 --> 17:36.751
I'’m going to sit my ass
here and drink liquor.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.245
Loving the shades.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.422
It'’s really bright in here.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.119
Does that just feel nice?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.425
I need my sleeps.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.166
Yeah. I'’m close to passing out.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.776
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.256
I love you, sexy woman.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.954
Hey, you know what'’s
hilarious, you guys?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.651
That I'’m drinking again.

18:08.826 --> 18:09.958
Good night, y'’all.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.873
Okay. Bye.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.918
I'’m going to sit my ass
here and drink liquor.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.532
Water before bed.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.142
Cool.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.449
- Hola.
- Hola.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.803
I need a lighter.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.632
Mother----ing yeah,
first drawer.

18:35.201 --> 18:38.465
Oh my God. It just couldn'’t
be any more gorgeous out here.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.997
And I can'’t, like...

18:48.997 --> 18:52.783
You'’ve got some----ing
desire to help the team

18:52.783 --> 18:55.482
as opposed to constantly
feel you need rest.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.267
Right.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.451
It'’s a beautiful day.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.673
If I were a first officer
on this boat,

19:12.673 --> 19:14.631
where would I keep a...
Oh, right here.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.526
<i>Copy that.
We'’re on our way.</i>

19:39.526 --> 19:41.223
Got to drive this big boat
off the dock

19:41.223 --> 19:43.573
Hopefully we'’re not
running aground.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.445
So we'’ve got a charter today.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.881
Who can remember stuff
that we need to do?

19:46.881 --> 19:48.404
Got the cushion covers.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.668
Hopefully by 8:00, we'’re going
to have cabin beds done.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.236
- Let'’s go for it.
- All right. Let'’s get to it.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.543
Nice guys.
Let'’s go.

19:56.543 --> 19:59.415
I probably saved
50 quotes last night.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.375
I like to read things
that, like, in the morning.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.593
That inspire you to
be successful.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.377
Yeah.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.378
Where are you going now?

20:05.378 --> 20:07.118
I don'’t know.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.251
You guys lock all the closets
so they don'’t flop open, right?

20:09.251 --> 20:10.557
Yes.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.080
Because some
of them are unlocked.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.124
Pardon?

20:13.124 --> 20:15.083
- Just check.
- All right sure.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.084
I'’ll do that.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.912
- There she is.
- Hey.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.088
You can get back to
chamoising now, I think.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.307
Okay.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.004
That was rude.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.267
I'’ll just be down here
all day if you need me.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.052
- Oh, yeah.
- Just call me.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.271
When we come off the dock...

20:29.271 --> 20:31.142
Drop that one.
Drop these.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.927
- That'’s last.
- Okay.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.058
<i>Rachel, Fraser.</i>

20:34.058 --> 20:36.017
Fraser, we have
provisions on the dock.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.627
Copy, on my way.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.368
Let'’s just set all of this
down to the walk in fridge.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.935
- Ugh.
- I know.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.242
Wha!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.765
Yum, yum, yum.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.201
Hey, go down.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.637
- Thank you.
- Oh, my. God.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.160
I'’m going to go down,
get into my whites.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.510
- Yeah.
- And if you could do the same,

20:50.510 --> 20:52.120
- when you'’re ready.
- That'’s fine.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.991
Oh, God. I need to do
something about that.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.563
Do you want us to go
to take off covers now?

21:00.563 --> 21:02.130
Yeah. Let'’s start
taking covers off.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.480
Alissa, if I can
get you on the welcome towels.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.700
That'’s not right, is it?

21:06.700 --> 21:09.311
All crew, all crew
let'’s meet in the main deck.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.278
Is it raining or is it
my imagination?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.975
Camille, do you want to go at
the end with them?

21:20.975 --> 21:22.803
It'’s gorgeous.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.152
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.154
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.547
- Tony.
- Tony.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.722
- So where are you from?
- Costa Rica.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.030
Nice to meet you.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.249
Thank you.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.338
- Thanks.
- So welcome aboard.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.515
Before we get going, Fraser
is going to show you around

21:39.515 --> 21:41.778
and then we'’ll load your luggage
and we'’re going to take off.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.040
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.390
Okay, shall we?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.000
All right,
let'’s make our way upstairs.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.480
Yay.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.872
Bridge deck aft.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.352
We'’ve got three dining opportunities,

21:50.352 --> 21:52.572
or at least tables to serve at.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.008
Okay, I'’m on deck now.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.357
No one'’s told me that,
but I'’m taking

21:55.357 --> 21:57.316
the highly initiative to do so.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.621
This is our sun deck.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.319
- Wow.
- The Jacuzzi is

22:00.319 --> 22:03.278
one of the largest Jacuzzis I'’ve
worked with on a superyacht.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.845
Ross, coming out for deck.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.194
On the fenders would be perfect.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.369
Thank you very much. Yeah.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.675
Do you mind
flaking the lines out?

22:08.675 --> 22:10.851
- Yeah.
- This is the master.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.026
The master?

22:12.026 --> 22:13.810
We are yachties!

22:13.810 --> 22:15.246
We should take turns
sleeping here.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.509
It'’s crazy.

22:16.509 --> 22:17.553
We can start freeing
up the lines.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.033
- Katie, go ahead.
- Yep.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.905
First time ever driving
this boat, 27 knots of wind.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.690
I got to take it off
the dock

22:23.690 --> 22:26.083
with the gold medal winner
and the golf champion.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.128
Pressure!

22:27.128 --> 22:28.564
Tony pull, pull, pull.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.175
Captain, foredeck, that
is all three lines on board.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.221
Starboard corner, 25 feet off
the dock, holding.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.223
Captain, Captain Bow, 60 feet
off the dock,

22:35.223 --> 22:36.746
and opening,
all clear ahead.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.706
- Thank you.
- You'’re welcome.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.403
Clear to swing clear to swing.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.883
Stern will clear the dock.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.364
That'’s some wind!

22:45.364 --> 22:46.539
So make sure I look skinny.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.671
Take off
like 15 pounds.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.941
Port side clearance
15 feet, holding.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.944
So beautiful.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.338
Okay, Captain,
we'’re clear of all obstructions.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.557
Clear of all obstructions.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.210
<i>Nice work, everyone.</i>

23:06.210 --> 23:07.995
<i>Thanks, Cap, made it
look like a walk in the park.</i>

23:07.995 --> 23:09.823
I was going to ask you
if that was stressful.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.694
Like playing center court, Wimbledon

23:11.694 --> 23:13.522
or something like that.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.089
Yeah, it was stressful.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.526
It is so motivating
to have a girl captain

23:17.526 --> 23:20.137
that can run a frickin'’
60 meter boat.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.836
yeah,
that is so awesome.

23:22.836 --> 23:26.013
Hey, watch your
head because you'’re tall

23:26.013 --> 23:27.710
and you'’re
right in front of her.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.104
All right, so I got crab,

23:30.104 --> 23:32.062
and I'’ve got the
beautiful branzino.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.890
I say we do, like
a Mediterranean lunch?

23:33.890 --> 23:36.284
Yeah. It'’s very easy
for me to cook.

23:36.284 --> 23:39.722
- Wow.
- It'’s beautiful.

23:39.722 --> 23:40.767
- What are we looking at?
- The Pitons.

23:40.767 --> 23:41.855
The Pitons. These two.

23:41.855 --> 23:45.162
Stand up
and look at real quick.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.337
That'’s so cool.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.296
Oh, isn'’t this right gorgeous?

23:48.296 --> 23:49.863
Absolutely beautiful.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.649
Captain, Captain,
foredeck report.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.216
Anchor ready to drop.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.479
We'’re going to go to
two shackles in the water.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.350
Copy, Cap, letting go now.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.396
Thank you guys for joining.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.615
You guys are it.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.968
Cap, foredeck.
That is anchor chain up.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.143
Stay 11:00.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.494
<i>Camille, we are good on deck.</i>

24:12.494 --> 24:13.495
<i>Thank you very much
for your help.</i>

24:13.495 --> 24:14.757
<i>You'’re welcome.</i>

24:14.757 --> 24:17.368
Hi, ladies. How are we doing
on drinks?

24:17.368 --> 24:20.284
- A little thirsty.
- Okay. I'’m here to solve that.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.330
Don'’t look, I'm nude.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.201
- Man.
- Yeah.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.508
I don'’t really need to
see that, you know.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.340
I came here thinking
that it was apparent

24:32.340 --> 24:34.821
that I was a deck stew and
that there was a role for me.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.824
Normally, I'’m used
to it being 50/50.

24:37.824 --> 24:41.523
I didn'’t sign up for yachting
to do----ing laundry.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.745
Okay, nice.
I'’m going to bring it forward.

24:45.745 --> 24:46.746
- All right.
- Okay, so now...

24:46.746 --> 24:48.269
Hell, captain.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.792
You'’re going to watch
the show, huh?

24:49.792 --> 24:51.228
That'’s pretty cool.

24:51.228 --> 24:54.014
Otherwise, we'’ve been
lifting that thing cap.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.058
All right.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.498
- Oh, oh!
- You got it.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.542
You got it.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.065
Oh!

25:02.065 --> 25:03.240
Oh, jeez.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.158
Yeah, it'’s fantastic, guys.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.553
Are you trying to go
to the bathroom?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.207
Just want to pee.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.556
It'’s this one.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.557
Stop it!

25:15.557 --> 25:16.906
What'’s that?

25:16.906 --> 25:19.082
Ross, can I ask you
a huge favor?

25:19.082 --> 25:20.257
I don'’t know.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.737
I don'’t have anything
to do inside,

25:21.737 --> 25:22.912
and I don'’t want to do it
any more.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.131
And I want to ride
that e-foil?

25:24.131 --> 25:27.090
Can you please tell
Fraser that I...

25:27.090 --> 25:29.005
Why? I'’m deck, I'm 50/50.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.225
- Yeah, I know.
- Why can'’t I get some help?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.531
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.707
Can you calm down
and be respectful, please?

25:34.707 --> 25:36.317
Yes. I will.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.145
The fact that she'’s come
in shouting and demanding

25:38.145 --> 25:40.277
in front of my crew,
I don'’t appreciate that.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.584
You know, it'’s
just not what we do.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.412
Fraser and I communicate.

25:44.412 --> 25:47.284
It'’s not you deciding
when you want to switch.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.374
If I don'’t say----ing
anything, y'’all don't say sh--.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.855
Excuse me. I'’m trying to be
respectful, but it'’s true.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.596
You'’re definitely not
being respectful.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.598
Okay. [bleep] this sh--.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.779
- I'’m telling you, girl.
- Can we please get it?

26:03.779 --> 26:05.738
- Are you really drunk?
- Are you kidding?

26:05.738 --> 26:07.827
We are professionals at this.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.611
I was being rude.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.613
- It'’s just how I do.
- Glad you know.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.484
Katie, it'’s your break time now.

26:13.484 --> 26:15.138
- Okay.
- Great job on the slide.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.444
- Thank you.
- You did it like a pro.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.054
You think it through,

26:18.054 --> 26:20.317
- you make a plan and you...
- Implement it, don'’t you?

26:20.317 --> 26:21.405
Yeah.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.755
I hope you'’re enjoying it
so far.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.887
No, I am.
You guys are... Yeah.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.410
- Whenever you need me.
- Yeah, for sure.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.674
- I'’m here just on that bridge.
- Thanks, Cap.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.633
We can get you seated,
watered and wined.

26:31.633 --> 26:32.982
Let'’s do that, perfect.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.681
Galley and interior,
the guests are making

26:35.681 --> 26:36.682
their way to the table.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.031
If I can have everyone

26:38.031 --> 26:39.336
on their stations,
that would be brilliant.

26:39.336 --> 26:42.252
Galley copies.
Is going into service.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.124
That looks juicy.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.823
I'’ll need you just
do the clearing.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.695
Absolutely. I'’ll do all
the cleaning at the end.

26:49.695 --> 26:50.826
Ross, Ross, Fraser.

26:50.826 --> 26:53.524
<i>You can have Camille on deck.</i>

26:53.524 --> 26:55.178
Okay, copy.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.702
He'’s going to be mad at me.
I don'’t----ing care.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.139
Got to set these men straight.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.403
- Here we go.
- Food'’s coming.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.665
Oh, breadsticks.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.188
Okay, so these are
going up right now.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.668
Okay?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.540
Yeah. If you guys just get
that trampoline pumped up,

27:09.540 --> 27:11.673
and then, Camille, if I can
have a chat with you

27:11.673 --> 27:13.675
- privately on the side just now.
- That'’s what I wanted to do.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.112
Thank you.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.549
Mediterranean quinoas
vegetable salad.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.029
Cool.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.728
I apologize to my delivery.
I'’ll start there.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.904
I don'’t have time for drama.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.819
If you come in
swearing and screaming

27:26.819 --> 27:28.603
and demanding
what you should be doing.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.778
Yeah.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.301
- To your heads of department...
- Right.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.652
Like that it'’s not going
to go well for you.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.218
Sure. The delivery sucks.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.394
My emotions get the better
of me far too often.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.571
I would stand up to
my principal in high school.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.225
One day she wants to
go on a power trip.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.053
She comes into the class
and she picks out all the kids

27:44.053 --> 27:45.707
that normally get in trouble

27:45.707 --> 27:48.101
and said that they were going
to pat us down for our phones.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.537
I was like,
You'’re not going to touch me.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.670
Like, you'’re like a
complete [bleep].

27:51.670 --> 27:55.674
And she decides to completely
expel me from Our Lady Academy.

27:55.674 --> 28:00.243
So I went and got a GED
and I still went to college.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.941
So winning.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.725
So you'’re with us
on deck now, yes?

28:03.725 --> 28:06.641
- Okay. Hug. Good.
- Oh, yay.

28:06.641 --> 28:07.816
Do you want to have a little...

28:07.816 --> 28:09.252
15 minutes or something?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.472
I don'’t want long.
Thank you, darling.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.474
You'’re working so hard.
Both of you, honestly.

28:13.474 --> 28:16.172
So go take 15.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.914
I'’m glad there was no social
media when I was a kid.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.960
I mean, we'’re 25,
30 years old.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.352
And you travel around the world,

28:22.352 --> 28:24.485
you make more money
than anybody you know,

28:24.485 --> 28:26.400
- and you'’re having...
- At that point in time.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.924
...fun. I did.

28:28.924 --> 28:31.100
- Hey, baby.
- Hayleys!

28:31.100 --> 28:35.104
Yeah, look at my feet!

28:35.104 --> 28:39.239
- Bunions!
- Little bunions!

28:39.239 --> 28:41.023
I really missed you today.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.939
I miss you so, so much, Hayley.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.550
That'’s a really good answer.
Well done.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.857
You'’re getting better
at this, aren'’t you?

28:48.857 --> 28:52.643
My boyfriend and I
are great.

28:52.643 --> 28:55.951
Some people say that the key
to a good relationship

28:55.951 --> 28:57.561
is communication.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.260
It'’s not.
It'’s sucking dick.

29:01.827 --> 29:02.958
All right?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.090
That'’s what it is.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.265
Right, babe.
I'’m going to go.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.614
So got back.
Get back to work.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.050
I miss you lots.
I love you.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.400
I miss you, too.
Love you, too.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.360
Oh, my God.
I'’m so scared.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.623
Oh my God.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.802
That was so crazy!

29:20.802 --> 29:21.890
She loved it.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.200
That'’s what I love about deck.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.375
Know, for a love of toys and.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.246
Toys in, and then
you just chill.

29:30.246 --> 29:31.770
Just...

29:31.770 --> 29:33.162
Talk to me. Also, I know what
it'’s going to be about.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.424
- Something happen?
- Oh, yes.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.383
She came flying down
into our space

29:36.383 --> 29:38.428
while we'’re prepping decks,
swearing and screaming.

29:38.428 --> 29:41.214
I'’m at a point now,
but all I want her to do

29:41.214 --> 29:43.172
is be on deck.
I'’ve given up now.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.826
Because she'’s more trouble
than she'’s worth.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.262
She'’s more trouble,
because I'’ll give her a task.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.568
She'’s infecting my crew
down there.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.831
You know what
I'’m thinking about?

29:49.831 --> 29:51.224
Take one guess.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.486
- Have a cigarette.
- One.

29:52.486 --> 29:53.748
Oh, so close.

29:53.748 --> 29:54.793
- Close, wasn'’t it?
- Yeah.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.837
What was it?
Drink.

29:55.837 --> 29:56.882
- Alcohol.
- Yeah.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.666
It'’s like alcohol or cigarette.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.276
This is gorgeous.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.061
You look very
namaste up there.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.889
- Exactly.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.456
- Let me grab it.
- That'’s perfect.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.636
<i>Alissa, Alissa, Fraser.</i>

30:12.636 --> 30:14.247
<i>Fraser, go for Alissa.</i>

30:14.247 --> 30:16.684
Do you want to
go down for an hour?

30:16.684 --> 30:18.120
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.081
Are you asleep?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.778
Seen the Pitons?

30:23.778 --> 30:25.171
Have you seen the Pitons?

30:25.171 --> 30:26.215
What?
What is it?

30:26.215 --> 30:27.869
Oh, it'’s over here.

30:27.869 --> 30:31.655
You'’re going to have to
get in further.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.092
- Chef?
- Yes?

30:33.092 --> 30:34.963
How many courses were
you think they'’re doing?

30:38.488 --> 30:41.622
So for tonight'’s dinner,
which is Gigi'’s favorite cuisine

30:41.622 --> 30:46.235
and where she'’s from,
we'’ve got Puerto Rican feast.

30:46.235 --> 30:50.370
The goal is to transport
Gigi back to childhood

30:50.370 --> 30:53.373
and all of her experiences
with the cuisine.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.766
I like to keep it concise
and focus on that cake.

30:55.766 --> 30:58.421
I that take cake'’s
kind of important to focus on

30:58.421 --> 31:00.510
For sure.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.992
Can you please source me
starter forks, starter knives.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.559
But I did a schedule
out there for you.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.908
- Okay.
- So no one'’s on anchor watch

31:06.908 --> 31:09.084
except for Ben until two.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.086
Okay, perfect.
Thank you very much, Captain.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.262
Call me if you need me.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.264
- Good.
- I'’m ready for night out.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.919
- Some hairspray.
- Ready to go.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.834
Love that color orange.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.881
- Cheers, everybody.
- Cheers.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.882
I'’m drinking water
right now.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.926
Good for you, hydrating?

31:24.926 --> 31:26.536
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.669
Freaked out.
Oh, what'’s happening here?

31:28.669 --> 31:30.062
Oh, whoa.

31:30.062 --> 31:33.108
- Oh, sh...
- Holy sh--. Is that smoke?

31:34.283 --> 31:37.112
It'’s a fire alarm.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.636
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, whoa. Smoke.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.769
Smoke!
Hey, smoke!

31:41.769 --> 31:42.770
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.337
All crew, all crew.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.252
- We have smoke.
- What?

31:46.252 --> 31:47.993
Somebody wake
Captain. Sandy, please.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.820
What'’s on fire?

31:49.820 --> 31:52.693
Life jackets
right behind here.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.958
Something'’s burning
on the deck.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.482
What the [bleep] is going on?

32:01.876 --> 32:03.225
It'’s a fire alarm.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.705
- Yo.
- Smoke!

32:04.705 --> 32:05.706
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

32:05.706 --> 32:06.707
Oh, my gosh.

32:06.707 --> 32:07.795
All crew, all crew.

32:07.795 --> 32:08.796
We have smoke.

32:08.796 --> 32:09.971
What?

32:09.971 --> 32:11.190
- Fire.
- I'’m going to get

32:11.190 --> 32:12.669
the other ladies
out of their cabins.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.541
What'’s on fire?

32:14.541 --> 32:16.804
All crew, all crew, can
we all muster on the aft deck?

32:16.804 --> 32:18.371
Where is the smoke coming from?

32:18.371 --> 32:20.025
The boat'’s on fire,
and I'’m blow drying my hair.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.504
I didn'’t hear a fire alarm.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.854
It is not a good day for Sandy
when I see smoke.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.073
I wonder what it is.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.727
So I'’ll let you ladies know

32:26.727 --> 32:29.251
that there are going to be
life jackets right behind here

32:29.251 --> 32:31.427
if we need to get to them.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.430
I think is electrical.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.345
Do you know where the
other guests are?

32:36.345 --> 32:38.739
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.480
Eight.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.703
Yeah.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.575
Okay.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.359
And what was it?

32:52.361 --> 32:54.015
Unfortunately,
boats catch on fire

32:54.015 --> 32:55.495
and it'’s usually electrical.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.062
The engineer found
there'’s a cable sat in the water

32:57.062 --> 33:00.282
for the air handlers.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.415
Yeah, it was a fire.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.025
In this case, it'’s
a smoldering wire

33:04.025 --> 33:05.113
on an air conditioning unit.

33:05.113 --> 33:06.549
Well, well done.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.247
- We'’ll let the engineers fix it.
- All right.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.292
The crew did a fantastic job,

33:10.292 --> 33:13.339
and I feel safe
with this crew.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.601
That'’s pretty awesome.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.037
Okay, we can go back to work.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.212
- Thank you.
- Okay.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.605
I'’m going to put a copy...

33:18.605 --> 33:19.606
There'’s a copy of us
in the crew mess.

33:19.606 --> 33:20.999
This is the new watch schedule.

33:22.913 --> 33:27.701
Tony, eight in the morning
till six in the evening.

33:27.701 --> 33:30.530
Then you have six in
the evening off until eight

33:30.530 --> 33:33.968
and then
you have eight until two.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.058
That'’s so sh--.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.059
Yeah well...

33:38.059 --> 33:39.800
I think we can sit.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.411
We can sit at the table
so we'’re ready.

33:42.411 --> 33:46.111
Oh, it looks nice.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.112
Chef, Fraser.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.417
Go ahead, Fraser.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.071
We'’re ready to go
when you are.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.246
Awesome.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.900
These napkin rings
are phenomenal.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.206
How cute!

33:54.206 --> 33:56.295
- Ross, can I have 5 minutes?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:56.295 --> 33:59.037
So this is lanthanum
with shrimp.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.822
I'’d really like to go
to bed, like, early.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.302
I know, I know.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.304
- Killer, man.
- I know, I know.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.696
The captain has
made the schedule

34:06.696 --> 34:08.089
and asked for us
to do the schedule.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.134
Yeah.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.831
I'’m an early morning person,

34:10.831 --> 34:14.704
so the change in the schedule
feels frustrating as hell.

34:14.704 --> 34:18.360
If we can tune it in any way
after this charter, we will.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.060
Seems that it will screw
my time to work out.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.670
That pisses me off.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.107
Right now, we just got
to stick with a plan.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.369
That is just very hard for me.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.805
But yeah, yeah, yeah. It'’s okay.

34:28.805 --> 34:30.851
- I will do it. I will do it.
- I know, I know.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.854
- Thank you.
- Thank you, chef.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.899
To Gigi, happy birthday.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.814
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.120
Happy 27th.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.861
We should wear one.

34:40.861 --> 34:42.384
Try it.
My hair looks...

34:42.384 --> 34:45.039
Look at this.
Would you look at this?

34:45.039 --> 34:46.519
You don'’t look bad.

34:46.519 --> 34:50.523
So this is the plantain
with shrimp and a salsa verde.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.961
Why didn'’t someone
kick me when I was a kid?

34:53.961 --> 34:55.789
I think I want to be a chef,
they should'’ve been like,

34:55.789 --> 34:58.879
"You'’re a----ing stupid idiot.
You shut the [bleep] up."

34:58.879 --> 35:01.186
That'’s amazing.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.926
Super family fun.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.842
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.496
Oh, holy [bleep].

35:07.496 --> 35:08.889
Guess what
I'’m thinking about.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.500
No, I'’m actually
not horny at all.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.154
- I'’m so proud of myself.
- That'’s sick.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.460
Oh, fabulous.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.026
Smells unreal.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.377
I was in Thailand once
and one of my friends,

35:18.377 --> 35:20.901
I was so horny,
and I was like, What?

35:20.901 --> 35:24.034
No, I masturbated in the
bathroom with her toothbrush.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.035
She, oh...

35:25.035 --> 35:26.733
She doesn'’t know.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.344
Only boatmance I'’ve ever had
is with electric toothbrush.

35:30.650 --> 35:34.567
Never had
a shag on a boat,

35:34.567 --> 35:36.960
just electric toothbrush
because I didn'’t bring a dildo.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.224
I didn'’t know if I'd be able
to get it through customs.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.662
She could have sold that thing
on eBay for a lot of money.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.968
Any vibrations a good
vibration, isn'’t it?

35:44.968 --> 35:46.187
At the end of the day.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.449
Even if I can'’t
find anything,

35:47.449 --> 35:48.885
I'’ll get the toothbrush
or whatever.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.060
What?

35:51.627 --> 35:54.848
Now for this course
you have picadillo,

35:54.848 --> 35:58.417
with port wine, Spanish olives
and a plantain crisp on top.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.418
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Thank you.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.202
Thank you, Rachel.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.595
You'’re going to bed?

36:02.595 --> 36:04.945
I'’m going to bed.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.816
- We'’ll save that.
- This is so amazing.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.166
You'’re getting true, authentic
Puerto Rican food.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.254
- It is.
- I'’m impressed.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.820
Yeah.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.692
That'’s okay.
I'’ll make Captain Sandy proud.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.650
I want to go around the table,
and I want everybody

36:14.650 --> 36:16.609
to talk about the coolest
thing they'’ve ever done.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.698
I met the Queen of England,
and I played tennis

36:18.698 --> 36:21.222
in front of the Queen of England
at the Royal Albert Hall.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.528
That was pretty cool.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.312
Wow, look at
that meat.

36:24.312 --> 36:28.186
I think my best was being
there for Gigi,

36:28.186 --> 36:29.361
giving birth to our kids.

36:29.361 --> 36:31.101
Aw...

36:31.101 --> 36:33.887
It'’s true, though,
and not fainting.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.458
For your final course,
you have course...

36:39.458 --> 36:40.937
la ropa vieja.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.637
Wow. That is so good.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.682
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

36:46.682 --> 36:48.031
Oh, it'’s so good.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.946
- It'’s like butter.
- This is amazing.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.078
Delicious.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.515
I'’m going to commence
cake making.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.648
I'’m so excited
about this cake.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.171
We can take blue tape
really quickly

36:57.171 --> 37:00.653
and cut me very thin,
thin lines of the blue tape.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.263
I want to make a tennis ball,

37:02.263 --> 37:04.309
and I'’ve got this
texture spray

37:04.309 --> 37:06.485
that should make it look fluffy.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.704
Rachel, it'’s amazing.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.793
I'’m going to serve her

37:10.793 --> 37:14.449
the most amazing
birthday cake ever.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.669
Tennis balls do this.

37:16.669 --> 37:17.931
- They sure do, don'’t they?
- Yeah.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.063
I just want to wake up
with this view.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.326
We'’re gonna.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.676
- No. No, no. [bleep] me.
- That'’s okay.

37:23.676 --> 37:27.114
Man. I just hope I'’m not
on watch tomorrow

37:27.114 --> 37:29.116
at four again, you know?

37:29.116 --> 37:30.465
Green, what do you think?

37:30.465 --> 37:32.075
It'’s like supposed
to be the court?

37:32.075 --> 37:34.687
It'’s darker than that,
but that looks just fine to me.

37:34.687 --> 37:37.603
It'’s all right. Whatever.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.868
Sh--, [bleep], no.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.000
I----ed it up.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.005
The color on the can is not
the color that comes out.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.880
And now looks like
SpongeBob just died.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.621
- No, it'’s all right.
- You think?

37:55.621 --> 37:57.971
That it'’s dead
like my soul.

37:57.971 --> 38:02.105
- What should we do?
- I don'’t know.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.629
I can'’t take it anymore.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.547
How do you feel about it?

38:08.547 --> 38:11.419
It'’s----ed.----ed.
But you know what?

38:11.419 --> 38:15.118
- What should we do?
- I don'’t know.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.424
It is----ed.

38:16.424 --> 38:19.384
And it'’s too late to
go back and fix it.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.908
Whatever.

There are some dishes there

39:29.976 --> 39:31.456
Did a good job.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.848
Yeah, it'’s very nice.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.894
Yeah. And you'’re good.
You can go to bed.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.593
- Night, night.
- Good night.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.555
These are dirty, will you
take these down to the laundry?

39:43.555 --> 39:45.208
- Absolutely.
- Will you start the laundry?

39:45.208 --> 39:46.384
Thank you.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.950
You'’re welcome.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.998
Oh, [bleep] my life.

39:51.998 --> 39:52.955
All right.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.960
You'’re so amazing.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.224
I'’ve never seen a captain mop
a galley floor.

40:01.224 --> 40:04.184
I got Alissa telling me,
I got Captain telling me.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.843
Captain Sandy pulled me
away to do another...

40:10.843 --> 40:12.801
- a couple jobs.
- Okay.

40:12.801 --> 40:16.457
Just laundry.
Just some laundry.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.850
- No, no, no.
- Is this garbage?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.982
She was wondering
where I was, and...

40:19.982 --> 40:21.070
I didn'’t say anything.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.811
- Did you do the laundry?
- Yes.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.073
- You put it in?
- I did.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.119
Awesome sauce.
Thank you.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.034
I wasn'’t complaining.
I was just telling her that

40:28.034 --> 40:29.470
because she gets upset
when I'’m not

40:29.470 --> 40:31.429
where I'’m supposed to be,
when I'’m not,

40:31.429 --> 40:32.908
- when I'’m supposed to be there.
- I don'’t get upset, babe.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.475
Well, no, I mean, that'’s fine.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.739
It'’s okay to be upset
about those types of things.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.567
So that'’s why I said that.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.874
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

40:49.751 --> 40:52.319
I don'’t know what
the [bleep] is going on.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.980
I'’m----ing going crazy.

41:04.766 --> 41:07.639
- I need some help.
- Yeah?

41:11.164 --> 41:13.340
Oh, go to bed.
I'’ll take care of that.

41:13.340 --> 41:16.212
I think I'’m motivating her.
Don'’t worry.

41:18.127 --> 41:19.868
Jesus.

41:19.868 --> 41:20.869
I feel like sh--.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.044
What'’s wrong?

41:22.044 --> 41:23.524
You know,
Camille is still awake.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.700
I have a question for you.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.006
This is dead serious.

41:27.006 --> 41:30.488
She'’s going so
- ing slow on purpose.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.619
Do you want to be on this boat?

41:31.619 --> 41:33.142
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.710
I will never ask something
of you that I won'’t do.

41:35.710 --> 41:36.711
Yeah.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.018
So if I do my job,

41:39.018 --> 41:40.541
you'’re going to want
to do your job.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.934
Right?

41:41.934 --> 41:43.326
Because you don'’t
want to disappoint me.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.590
- I don'’t.
- Because how hard I work, right?

41:45.590 --> 41:46.982
It'’s true.

41:46.982 --> 41:49.332
You'’re going to get
the same thing from them

41:49.332 --> 41:50.638
if you work hard.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.292
I'’m saying this because
I want you on board.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.206
Right, right, right.

41:53.206 --> 41:54.512
She gets to----ing sit there

41:54.512 --> 41:56.035
and bond with Captain Sandy
and----ing

41:56.035 --> 41:58.603
play the victim again.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.605
- I agree.
- Thank you.

42:00.605 --> 42:01.997
And then
Captain Sandy pissed me off

42:01.997 --> 42:04.043
because she literally
just like

42:04.043 --> 42:07.089
just like,
literally is just like,

42:07.089 --> 42:08.177
go to bed.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.402
Next on "Below Deck"...

42:15.402 --> 42:18.579
- You'’re ready?
- Let'’s go.

42:18.579 --> 42:21.364
- Oh, no.
- Oh...

42:21.364 --> 42:23.845
Yes.
Woo!

42:23.845 --> 42:25.281
That'’s how you play tennis.

42:25.281 --> 42:26.761
All right, hold on.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.328
Door here.

42:35.291 --> 42:36.684
Inappropriately.

42:36.684 --> 42:39.731
I'’m just----ing over it.
and so----ing annoyed.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.734
You gave Alissa to task me
with all the sh--

42:42.734 --> 42:44.126
- she doesn'’t want to do.
- No, no, no.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.388
I'’m getting
pulled in every direction.

42:45.388 --> 42:47.913
This is called
working on a superyacht.

42:47.913 --> 42:49.567
Are you----ing mental?

42:49.567 --> 42:51.046
Camille, Camille, Rachel.

42:51.046 --> 42:54.093
Are you able to come
back and finish the silverware?

42:54.093 --> 42:55.747
Captain Sandy
sent me for a 30 minute break

42:55.747 --> 42:57.226
and then I'’ll be back.

42:57.226 --> 42:58.924
Hey, Camille, don'’t throw
me under the bus.

42:58.924 --> 43:00.273
Yo, she'’s stupid!

43:00.273 --> 43:03.493
I'’m gonna lose my sh--, dude.
