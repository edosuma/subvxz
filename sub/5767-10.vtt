00:09.470 --> 00:12.132
GRACE:
Mom? Mom, wake up.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.136
I need help.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.148
(voice breaking):
Mom?

00:16.180 --> 00:18.171
(loud thud)

00:24.520 --> 00:26.488
GRACE:
We're fine, Mom.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.488
We just left Dad's.
What's wrong?

00:28.520 --> 00:29.521
ALICIA:
Nothing.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.221
I just... Nothing.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.454
Checking in.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.626
Zach's driving safe.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.594
No. I know. It's not it.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.621
But tell Zach not
to get on the expressway.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.796
Mom says

00:38.830 --> 00:40.388
don't get on the expressway.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.408
Oh, your firm was
on the radio.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.464
What? Why?

00:43.510 --> 00:45.432
Something about
a white supremacist.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.437
Donald Pike?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.435
Donald Pike.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.606
He got some witness killed.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.572
Colin Sweeney?

00:49.610 --> 00:50.770
No, no, it was

00:50.810 --> 00:52.539
just some witness.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.140
Uh, they were saying that your
firm's involved with the case.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.488
Got to go. School.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.612
We got to go, Mom.
Love you.

00:57.650 --> 00:58.844
Okay, leave a note for me

00:58.890 --> 01:01.609
on the refrigerator if you go
anywhere after school, okay?

01:05.530 --> 01:06.792
(sighs)

01:06.830 --> 01:08.252
I'm not ready.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.494
You are. You're fine.

01:09.530 --> 01:10.758
It's my first time in court.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.734
I know, but it's not
court, it's arbitration.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.567
It has a $35,000 cap.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.307
The opposing lawyers will most
likely go through the motions.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.570
It's perfect to
get your feet wet.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.828
So, just present your case
solidly, competently,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.144
and with _as little
fuss as pOSS|b|e, okay?

01:24.180 --> 01:26.239
Okay. Hi.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.413
Oh, I think
that's the other attorney.

01:29.450 --> 01:31.441
She doesn't look
too intimidating.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.856
Mrs. Florrick.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.221
Hello.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.579
Martha. What a surprise.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.598
So, that's who you hired

01:40.630 --> 01:42.291
instead of me?
Is she good?

01:42.330 --> 01:43.262
She is.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.723
Well, she sure is blonde.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.897
What pretty hair.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.431
I'm glad to see
you landed somewhere, Martha.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.529
Canning & Meyers seems
like a perfect fit.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.639
Yes, with 20% less salary.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.740
Because I thought I was going
to be hired somewhere else.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.640
I'm not here to offer you
life lessons, Martha,

02:02.690 --> 02:04.146
but you're a little young

02:04.190 --> 02:05.543
to be holding a grudge.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.751
You're right. You're not
here to offer life lessons.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.781
Good luck.

02:11.490 --> 02:12.696
Good luck.

02:12.730 --> 02:13.754
Thank you.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.189
Do you know her?

02:16.230 --> 02:17.868
I do.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.164
How confident do you
feel about this case?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.531
Pretty good.

02:21.570 --> 02:22.605
Remember when I told you

02:22.640 --> 02:24.403
to just give a
solid performance?

02:24.440 --> 02:25.805
Yeah._
Forget It.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.478
Kick ass.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.579
(phone buzzing)

02:28.610 --> 02:30.339
Your cell phone
is ringing, Will.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.699
It's Alicia.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.480
_ Want me _
to gIve you some privacy?

02:37.590 --> 02:38.784
(beep)

02:38.820 --> 02:39.957
Hello.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.617
(beep)

02:41.660 --> 02:43.582
I missed it.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.656
You know, one thing I've always
liked about you, Diane?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.849
You never played games.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.424
You think I'm playing a game?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.495
I think you need
to stop mothering.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.395
I can take care
of my life.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.261
It's not your life
when it impacts me.

02:56.310 --> 02:59.700
Your relationship
with Alicia impacts me.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.750
KALIN DA:
The State's Attorney's office

03:12.790 --> 03:13.950
is no longer targeting drugs.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.912
It's targeting you.
I know.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.689
I heard
Peter put Wendy Scott-Carr

03:17.730 --> 03:18.628
in charge of the investigation.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.696
Cary and Dana Lodge
are still involved,

03:20.730 --> 03:21.549
but they answer to her.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.420
_But Peter's_ still
In charge, right?

03:23.470 --> 03:24.698
I don't know.

03:24.730 --> 03:25.890
(sighs)

03:25.930 --> 03:27.693
I need to know if...

03:28.870 --> 03:30.929
I need to know _how
personal this IS.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.938
IfI made changes

03:32.980 --> 03:35.972
here, would the
investigation go away?

03:36.010 --> 03:37.477
If you stopped

03:37.510 --> 03:40.377
being close with Alicia,
would that change things?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.684
I don't want
that question asked.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.449
I'll find out.
Good.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.311
Anything we should worry about
with this white supremacist

03:47.360 --> 03:48.486
killing witnesses?

03:48.520 --> 03:49.782
Donny Pike? No.
We're fine.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.479
No chance at _ret_ribution?
(phone rIngIng)

03:51.530 --> 03:52.690
That's unlikely.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.925
Good. Thanks.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.860
I DGECI some access.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.835
Really? You've been wanting
a lot of access these days.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.964
Okay, well, I may need
some access of my own,

04:03.010 --> 04:05.308
so, I'll call
you back.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.477
KaHnda?

04:06.510 --> 04:07.738
Yup. She said
to say hi.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.873
No.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.548
No...?

04:11.580 --> 04:12.740
The budget's too high.

04:12.780 --> 04:13.917
It isn't, Peter.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.009
We've been very careful
in analyzing

04:16.050 --> 04:18.018
how long this investigation
will take,

04:18.050 --> 04:19.483
how much investigator time.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.953
Uh-huh.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.685
And how long will it take?

04:22.730 --> 04:25.654
One year.

04:25.690 --> 04:27.726
That sounds like
you're losmg your way.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.296
Peter,

04:29.330 --> 04:31.764
I'm here
because you asked me to be here.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.734
You were worried
that If you supervnsed

04:33.770 --> 04:35.590
this investigation,
you would be tempted

04:35.640 --> 04:37.858
to go lightly
on your wife's firm.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.731
I applaud
that ethical foresight.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.941
Now, if I go easier

04:42.980 --> 04:44.402
on your wife's firm,

04:44.450 --> 04:46.418
I won't be fulfilling the task
you've given me.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.816
Yes, but your task is not
to create a new task.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.715
I'm looking into corruption
at your wife's firm.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.081
Wendy,

04:52.120 --> 04:53.849
Cook County, like the rest
of the country,

04:53.890 --> 04:55.653
is going
through a budget crisis.

04:55.690 --> 04:58.989
You guys are just gonna have
to live within your means.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.493
You've been given
the steering wheel,

05:03.530 --> 05:06.067
but I still put the gas
in the car.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.933
We need a freelance investigator
who's good and cheap.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.506
They're all pretty tied up.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.666
What about
Andrew Wiley?

05:11.710 --> 05:13.678
Who's that?
Good freelancer.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.109
His wife's rich, so he
doesn't need the money.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.869
He's a friend of
yours, isn't he, Cary?

05:16.910 --> 05:18.741
He tends to go a bit free-range,
hard to control.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.042
Kind of like me?

05:20.080 --> 05:23.049
Not editorializing,
just describing.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.785
Well, let's meet your friend.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.378
MAN:
Okay.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.026
Was it Cicero who said,
"Here I stand: a man?"

05:30.060 --> 05:32.756
Well, here we sit.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.427
(man chuckles)

05:34.460 --> 05:35.757
Okay, you're all here

05:35.800 --> 05:37.825
because you've agreed
to binding arbitration.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.997
And that means the decision
of the arbitrator--

05:40.040 --> 05:42.634
and yes, we do say
"arbitrator," not to "arbiter"--

05:42.670 --> 05:44.638
for those of you taking notes
at home...

05:44.670 --> 05:45.807
(man chuckles)

05:45.840 --> 05:47.000
The decision of the arbitrator,

05:47.040 --> 05:48.871
and that would be myself,
is final.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.104
Are we all agreed on that?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.469
CAITLIN AND MARTHA:
Yes, Mr. Arbitrator.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.647
Oh, my goodness gracious.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.772
You can sit back down.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.811
We don't need to be so formal.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.442
Was it Shaw--
George Bernard Shaw-- who said

05:57.490 --> 05:58.787
that formality is a, um...

05:58.820 --> 06:00.651
not a, uh...

06:00.690 --> 06:01.816
not a good thing?

06:01.860 --> 06:03.521
So, shall we call
the first witness?

06:03.560 --> 06:04.879
Pamela Raker.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.818
I'm a professor
of English literature...

06:06.860 --> 06:11.160
Actually, I was a professor
of English literature

06:11.200 --> 06:12.963
until I was fired in August.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.389
And who fired you?
Mr. Daniel Clove,

06:15.440 --> 06:16.805
the provost here.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.637
He told me
he needed to downsize,

06:18.670 --> 06:22.504
but then he hired and promoted
another English professor.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.040
And why do you believe
you were fired?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.843
Objection. Calls
for speculation.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.438
Oh. First objection of the day.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.970
And I'm gonna sustain that.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.988
Um...

06:32.220 --> 06:33.187
Why were you fired... ?

06:33.220 --> 06:34.812
Objection.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.748
Again, calls for
speculation.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.121
MAN:
And there's
the second one.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.798
Also sustained.

06:39.830 --> 06:42.993
Um... let's see.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.827
Just one second.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.895
ALICIA (whispering):
Take it step by step.

06:46.940 --> 06:47.998
What happened first?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.598
Okay.

06:49.640 --> 06:54.179
What happened on the day
before you were fired?

06:54.210 --> 06:58.579
Mr. Clove... made
a phy5|cal advance toward me.

06:58.610 --> 07:02.888
I resisted, and the next day,
I was fired.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.046
Thank you.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.682
No further questions.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.153
Ms. Raker, hello.

07:09.190 --> 07:12.227
I'm sorry. This sexual
advance sounds terrible.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.955
My gosh, what happened?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.595
PAMELA:
He reached for my shoulders,
and I pushed him away.

07:17.630 --> 07:18.927
MARTHA:
And where was this,

07:18.970 --> 07:20.460
in a bedroom somewhere?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.468
No, it was the staff lounge.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.535
In the lounge?
Really? Alone?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.037
No.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.708
So, did someone
call the cops?

07:27.740 --> 07:29.640
No, they're used to it
from Mr. Clove.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.840
Because isn't it
true that what

07:30.880 --> 07:34.714
you describe is Mr. Clove trying
to massage your shoulders?

07:34.750 --> 07:36.786
Yes.
And...

07:36.820 --> 07:38.242
this is something
Mr. Clove does

07:38.290 --> 07:39.917
good-naturedly to
all professors?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.109
That doesn't make it right.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.821
It's unwanted attention.

07:42.860 --> 07:47.627
I resisted, and the next day,
I was fired.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.991
This is much ado about nothing.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.099
I'm a tactile person.

07:50.130 --> 07:53.759
If someone refuses and say "no,"
I never do it again.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.892
I respect boundaries.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.807
And you squeeze the shoulders
of both men and women?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.000
As an encouragement.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.530
It's not sexual.
And

08:00.580 --> 08:03.208
when Ms. Raker asked you
to stop, you stopped?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.569
Yes, of course.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.770
I'm sorry

08:05.810 --> 08:06.947
I made her uncomfortable.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.969
MARTHA:
Thank you.
No further questions.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.578
Hit him hard.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.042
You stopped, but
then you fired her?

08:11.090 --> 08:12.216
CLOVE:
No.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.285
I fired her because

08:13.320 --> 08:15.754
she was receiving
negative student evaluations.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.223
That had nothing to do

08:17.260 --> 08:18.989
with her refusing
a shoulder squeeze.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.258
My God.
I'm not an idiot.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.551
(Martha laughs)

08:21.600 --> 08:23.192
But you told...

08:23.230 --> 08:24.959
(chuckling)
I mean,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.696
Pamela says something
differently, doesn't she?

08:27.740 --> 08:28.934
ARBITRATOR:
Who's Pamela?

08:28.970 --> 08:31.029
My client, Mr. Arbitrator.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.231
Oh, yup, she sure is.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.736
Go ahead.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.769
(Martha giggles)

08:35.810 --> 08:39.075
Mr. Arbitrator, could you ask
the opposing counsel

08:39.110 --> 08:40.646
to refrain _
from her vocalizations?

08:40.680 --> 08:43.046
My...? What am I doing?

08:43.090 --> 08:45.046
You are making scoffing
and chuckling sounds

08:45.090 --> 08:46.853
to intimidate my co-counsel.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.084
MARTHA:
Really?

08:48.120 --> 08:49.849
I would think that
Mrs. Florrick's

08:49.890 --> 08:53.018
interruptions would be
much more likely to disrupt

08:53.060 --> 08:54.994
her co-counsel than
any sound I'm making.

08:55.030 --> 08:58.090
Okay, ladies, we don't want
to have a catfight here.

08:58.130 --> 09:00.690
(laughing):
You can go ahead and
answer the question.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.196
What was the question?

09:02.240 --> 09:04.060
CAITLIN:
Let's start again.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.066
Why did you tell Pamela,
my client,

09:06.110 --> 09:08.578
that you were downsizing
the department,

09:08.610 --> 09:11.340
when in fact, you hired someone
to replace her the next day?

09:11.380 --> 09:13.041
I didn't want
to hurt her feelings.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.274
Nobody likes to hear they're
getting negative reviews.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.744
And did you hire someone who
was happy to get your backrubs?

09:17.790 --> 09:18.848
Objection. Argumentative.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.050
Oh, I don't know.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.955
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.855
Yes, sustained.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.858
Let me try again.
(clears her throat)

09:25.890 --> 09:28.927
When did you get
these student evaluations?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.962
Which student evaluations?
The ones you
used as a basis

09:31.000 --> 09:32.194
for firing my client?

09:32.230 --> 09:34.164
I don't know.
In August.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.189
You're right.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.208
It was in August.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.209
Three days after you fired her.

09:42.180 --> 09:46.139
These are not the_ evaluations
I was referring to.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.809
They were verbal from fellow
teachers and students.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.340
They said that Ms. Raker
was disruptive,

09:51.390 --> 09:53.119
argumentative,
not up to her job.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.752
And what were these

09:54.790 --> 09:57.122
arguments about--
the arguments

09:57.160 --> 09:58.081
you referred to?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.995
I don't know.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.827
Politics, for one.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.124
She's very vocal
about her differences.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.263
Her differences,
meaning she's a Republican?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.131
Objection. Relevance.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.263
The relevance is that
if our client was fired

10:10.310 --> 10:11.402
for her political views,

10:11.440 --> 10:14.170
there is no cap on
the arbitration recovery.
How so?

10:14.210 --> 10:15.279
Sexual harassment
is included

10:15.310 --> 10:18.279
in the automatic arbitration
cap dispute resolution.

10:18.310 --> 10:20.847
But there is no cap
for civil rights violations,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.643
and to fire someone
for their politics

10:22.690 --> 10:24.043
is a civil rights violation.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.289
Anything?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.185
Mr. Arbitrator, we ask

10:30.230 --> 10:32.084
for a recess to discuss
With our Witness.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.189
Take all the time you want.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.623
Good job.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.869
Now this will get interesting.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.130
(beep)

10:43.170 --> 10:44.307
I may need your help.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.229
I'll be right down.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.221
(knocking)

11:03.260 --> 11:05.251
DIANE:
Hello.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.121
Are you busy?

11:13.140 --> 11:17.361
_ You have a_ small
hairline crack right here.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.379
_ I think there's_ a hole
in your air duct insulation.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.799
I can hear a small hiss.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.805
I have perfect pitch.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.148
Did you know that?

11:26.180 --> 11:28.148
My parents wanted me
to be a concert pianist.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.374
I did not
know that.

11:29.420 --> 11:32.412
My parents wanted
me to be a senator.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.815
I could see that.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.816
So what are we up
to in here, Eli?

11:35.860 --> 11:37.157
Oh, I'm meeting
with a new client.

11:37.190 --> 11:38.122
See?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.721
It appears I am no longer
flavor of the month.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.160
What do you plan
to do about that?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.326
I plan to sit here
and study the ceiling.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.519
Eli,

11:46.570 --> 11:48.959
do you notice all the lavwers
out there rushing around?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.139
Do you ever wonder
why they're so busy?

11:51.170 --> 11:53.400
'Cause they got gumption?

11:53.440 --> 11:54.930
Because they're not
trying to go it alone.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.402
You've put too much
pressure on yourself

11:56.440 --> 11:58.977
to bring in your own
client base, Eli.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.477
You've pissed off
Will to the point

12:00.520 --> 12:01.646
where he doesn't want
to send you clients.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.444
David Lee is handling the
divorce of a congresswoman.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.445
VVho?

12:05.490 --> 12:06.479
I'm not going
to tell you.

12:06.520 --> 12:07.851
Talk to him.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.448
I know you're used to
going it alone, Eli.

12:09.490 --> 12:13.358
That's why you're
in here alone.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.288
Make friends.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.161
Be nice to people.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.237
Don't try to do
it all yourself.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.467
She tells us to check in
and then she's not even there.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.909
It's fine, just
leave a message.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.829
She's probably in court.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.371
(phone vibrating)

12:31.410 --> 12:34.447
Ah, Mrs. Florrick.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.344
Mr. Canning.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.347
I've missed you.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.348
And I you.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.482
So how are
our children doing?

12:39.520 --> 12:40.555
Playing nice.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.956
So you didn't like
Martha?

12:42.990 --> 12:44.355
I liked her.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.995
If we hadn't hired Caitlin,
it would have been her.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.555
And Caitlin was, what,
just so irresistible?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.795
Do you find that
hard to believe?

12:51.830 --> 12:53.559
Alicia, Caitlin
was hired

12:53.600 --> 12:54.692
because she's
DaVId Lee's niece.

12:54.740 --> 12:58.232
I know how things work, I
know how the game is played.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.931
Martha was
the better hire,

12:59.980 --> 13:01.379
but like everything else
at your firm,

13:01.410 --> 13:03.048
it's who you know,
not what you do.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.446
Oh, unlike your
grand meritocracy?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.472
Do I look like someone
who judges books by covers?

13:08.520 --> 13:11.080
No, Caitlin is the package,
but Martha is the real deal.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.384
Let's go in, see
who's better.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.217
Just so you know, there's
a job for you at my firm.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.284
Good to know.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.287
CLOVE:
I think my point

13:17.330 --> 13:18.285
was missed.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.218
I didn't say
I laid off Ms. Raker

13:20.260 --> 13:22.296
because her politics
were different than mine.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.922
MARTHA: Her politics were
irrelevant to your decision?

13:23.970 --> 13:24.925
Of course.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.564
I run
a tolerant workplace.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.205
In fact, she made everything
political-- intolerant.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.605
She argued
with everyone.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.005
And that is_ not
a CIVII rights issue?

13:33.040 --> 13:35.008
Not in my opinion, no.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.337
If a person
is making it difficult

13:36.380 --> 13:38.405
for other people to work,
it is within my purview

13:38.450 --> 13:39.405
to let them go.
Specifics help you here.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.145
The more specific, the better.
That's all I did.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.272
No further
questions.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.845
So, Mr. Clove, I'm confused.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.915
Did you fire our client
because of the first reason--

13:46.960 --> 13:49.155
downsizing-- or
the second reason--

13:49.190 --> 13:51.556
the student evaluations
that you didn't read--

13:51.590 --> 13:54.457
or the third reason--
disrupting the workplace?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.388
CLOVE: Maybe you do things
for only one reason, miss.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.863
I tend to do things for many.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.936
So which_
reason was it?

13:59.970 --> 14:01.460
The evaluations
I heard

14:01.500 --> 14:05.038
from teachers and students
and what I mentioned--

14:05.070 --> 14:06.264
she was disruptive
in the workplace.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.505
Because she spoke
about politics?

14:08.540 --> 14:09.529
What kind
of politics?

14:09.580 --> 14:12.140
The Tea Party line,
anti-choice, things like that.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.545
She spoke about
abortion?

14:13.580 --> 14:14.547
She spoke
against abortion?

14:14.580 --> 14:15.547
Yes.

14:15.580 --> 14:18.447
She was reacting to something
she'd seen on CNN

14:18.490 --> 14:20.515
about Roe v. Wade
and that it's a genocide.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.515
She just went off.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.585
CAITLIN:
The other teachers
disagreed with her?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.120
Objection--
calls for speculation.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.627
I'm going to sustain that.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.992
Did the other teachers complain
about her?

14:29.030 --> 14:30.964
Yes, but not because
they disagreed with her,

14:31.000 --> 14:32.592
but because_she was
disruptive.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.166
So there were
some professors

14:34.200 --> 14:35.189
who agreed
with her

14:35.240 --> 14:36.935
that abortion is genocide?

14:36.970 --> 14:38.631
I don't know, I didn't ask.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.479
I make it a point
not to ask.

14:40.510 --> 14:43.104
My workplace is
politically neutral.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.539
I don't tolerate politics
in the workplace.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.310
So, uh, let's turn to her
other political views.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.580
You mentioned the Tea Party
line, things like that.

14:50.620 --> 14:51.587
What do you consider

14:51.620 --> 14:53.611
to be the Tea
Party line?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.125
Oh, would you like me
to slow down for you?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.424
Well, that would be
the sporting thing to do.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.451
Hmm.

15:10.540 --> 15:14.636
That's okay, you can tell
Mr. Canning I'm done.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.669
(man making whooshing noises)

15:16.710 --> 15:19.645
CARY:
Andrew Wiley.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.272
Oh, no, no, you don't want me.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.117
Duty calls, buddy.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.181
(lawyer speaking
indistinctly)

15:32.690 --> 15:34.658
"Assuming the exercise
of any average

15:34.700 --> 15:36.656
"provided for
in '3' above

15:36.700 --> 15:38.099
"does not conclude

15:38.130 --> 15:40.166
"between the Parties

"the Parties agree to

"to binding arbitration,

15:43.170 --> 15:45.400

15:45.440 --> 15:46.737
binding arbitration..."

15:46.770 --> 15:49.409
WILL:
I understand you want to push
this off as long as possible,

15:49.440 --> 15:50.646
but my client has
pressing time issues

15:50.680 --> 15:51.647
that makes that impossible.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.647
CLOVE:
I think my point

15:52.680 --> 15:54.511
was politically neutral.

15:54.550 --> 15:57.314
I didn't say I prevented
individual teacher activism.

15:57.350 --> 15:58.385
CAITLIN:
But you fired Pamela

15:58.420 --> 15:59.682
because she disagreed with
these political beliefs?

15:59.720 --> 16:03.383
CLOVE:
No, I fired Ms. Raker because
she was disruptive at work.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.658
CAITLIN:
But if she supported

16:04.690 --> 16:06.419
these positions, she
wouldn't be disruptive?

16:06.460 --> 16:07.996
I can't answer that--
that's a hypothetical.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.497
None Of US can answer that.

16:09.530 --> 16:10.622
Mr. Arbitrator,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.696
this is an arbitration about
facts, not imagined slights,

16:13.740 --> 16:16.561
and the facts are that it's
Within the provost's purVIeW

16:16.600 --> 16:17.498
to fire Ms. Raker

16:17.540 --> 16:19.030
for causing a disruption
to the workplace.

16:19.070 --> 16:20.332
And if the disruption
was merely

16:20.380 --> 16:21.733
because Pamela Raker
was a Republican?

16:21.780 --> 16:22.804
As long as
he fired her

16:22.840 --> 16:24.444
because of the disruption
and not the politics,

16:24.480 --> 16:25.447
there's no civil rights
infraction.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.448
Okay, thank you.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.187
Goodness gracious... the
handlers have taken over.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.279
Mr. Arbitrator, we ask that
this complaint be dismissed.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.514
And we ask
the arbitrator's indulgence.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.618
_ We have further
CIVII rights arguments,

16:34.660 --> 16:36.412
but we won't be able
to present them until tomorrow.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.529
Objection,
Mr. Arbitrator.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.688
At a certain point,
this arbitration must conclude.

16:40.730 --> 16:41.697
Okay.

16:41.730 --> 16:43.288
Good idea, thank you very much.

16:43.330 --> 16:47.289
Well observed, well argued,
well, well played,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.137
and with that,
we'll reconvene tomorrow.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.432
Mr. Arbitrator, please.
Hold on.

16:50.470 --> 16:52.461
I will not _
shortchange justice,

16:52.510 --> 16:56.435
Mr. Canning, that's not going
to happen, not here.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.108
It means we'll be here all week
if we have to be.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.675
So, adjournment.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.746
(chuckles)

17:04.790 --> 17:06.041
Very smart.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.614
Arbitrators get
paid by the hour.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.810
They love their
recesses and tangents.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.385
What's next, inalienable
rights of life and liberty?

17:12.430 --> 17:13.499
Good idea.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.657
Yeah, your only
problem is damages.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.167
All this effort and
she's still only out,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.792
What, a paycheck or two?

17:21.570 --> 17:22.662
Hey, it's Caitlin.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.258
Yeah, do you have a minute?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.733
The problem we have is damages.

17:26.770 --> 17:28.306
(indistinct chatter)

17:28.340 --> 17:29.534
Nice pass,
Your Honor.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.347
Oh, little girl.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.347
Angela, give the ball back.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.213
Angela, give the ball. Here.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.217
Thanks.
No problem.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.217
You're Will Gardner,
right?

17:38.250 --> 17:39.512
Iam.
Do I...?

17:39.550 --> 17:40.619
Can just anybody
join the game

17:40.660 --> 17:41.410
or is it...?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.382
Oh, no, sorry,
just old friends.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.624
Lawyers, judges, weekend
warriors, you know.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.752
It's nice to meet you.

17:45.790 --> 17:46.722
I'm, I'm not a lavwer,
but I am

17:46.760 --> 17:48.751
a freelance investigator
for Wendy Scott-Carr.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.791
Does that help?

17:52.630 --> 17:54.666
I'll be right back.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.793
Oh, we going again?

17:56.840 --> 17:58.808
You guys have
the wrong idea about this.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.807
Really, What's
the right idea?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.728
The right idea is,
friends are playing ball.

18:01.780 --> 18:02.599
This is not about work.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.449
It's about What
happens after work.

18:04.480 --> 18:08.109
Oh, yeah, that makes sense--
lawyers, judges, friends.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.549
There's nothing criminal
in socializing.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.740
You're right.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.189
See, the thing is,
I've been looking

18:12.220 --> 18:13.312
into the Lockhart/
Gardner cases

18:13.360 --> 18:14.554
for the past
three years.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.683
It's kind of amazing,
really.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.823
Why is that?
How many you win.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.828
We're good.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.727
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah, apparently.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.625
You've got, like,
an 80% Win rate--

18:24.670 --> 18:26.297
Angela, you're going
to get really dizzy--

18:26.330 --> 18:30.334
often in front of some very,
very friendly judges.

18:30.370 --> 18:34.136
You have a problem With
any individual case, show me,

18:34.180 --> 18:35.579
and I'll show you how we won.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.703
Deal.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.706
Sabnna,
no more apple juice.

18:39.750 --> 18:40.819
I have to go, but I will--

18:40.850 --> 18:44.638
I'll, I'll bring you some
odd wins and we'll discuss.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.389
Sure, anything for you guys in
the state's attorney's office.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.422
Come on, honey, I told you.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.497
Yeah?
(clears throat)

19:00.870 --> 19:04.408
Eli, to What do I owe
this honor?

19:04.440 --> 19:06.499
Just making the rounds.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.337
Rounds, what rounds?

19:08.380 --> 19:11.269
Seeing how people work,
What they do,

19:11.310 --> 19:14.848
being... friendly.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.213
Ah, well, sit down.

19:26.590 --> 19:27.557
Would you like some Scotch?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.921
No.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.723
Thank you, though.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.668
So...

19:34.700 --> 19:36.531
So...

19:36.570 --> 19:37.537
(sniffs)

19:37.570 --> 19:39.561
You want me to share the wealth.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.578
The...?

19:41.610 --> 19:42.736
My clients

19:42.780 --> 19:44.600
Who would
benefit you,

19:44.650 --> 19:46.948
Who I could introduce to you

19:46.980 --> 19:49.369
if _I were
so inclined.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.547
And how do I
so incline you?

19:51.590 --> 19:54.514
I don't know.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.551
I'm a mystery.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.558
Okay, I'll have
some Scotch.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.591
ALICIA:
We go

20:00.630 --> 20:02.848
for the general concept
of damage to reputation.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.960
Pamela couldn't
get another job.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.888
Do you need
something?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.738
Uh, it's not
the original e-mail,

20:10.770 --> 20:13.637
but it's been quoted
there and there.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.729
Oh, this is fantastic,
Kalinda, thanks.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.542
Alicia, it's damages.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.468
I didn't know
you were on this.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.716
Oh, I asked her to.

20:20.750 --> 20:21.739
I called her
yesterday.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.884
If you need anything else,
just give me a call.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.444
Thanks, Kalinda.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.583
CAITLIN:
"She's nice.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.383
I just have a real problem
With homophobes."

20:29.420 --> 20:30.489
Did you write that, sir?

20:30.530 --> 20:33.397
I wrote that as a private
e-mail to one other person.

20:33.430 --> 20:34.624
Yes, and that
one other person

20:34.660 --> 20:36.958
was another provost
at another school.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.820
He asked my opinion
of Ms. Raker.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.428
Your defamatory
comment was discovered

20:40.470 --> 20:42.688
on a private Web site for
college administrators,

20:42.740 --> 20:45.459
and that is why our client had
difficulty getting a new job.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.568
Excuse me,

20:46.610 --> 20:50.740
I'd love to share Caitlin's
sense of outrage here,

20:50.780 --> 20:54.272
but Mr. Clove's comments were
written in a private e-mail

20:54.320 --> 20:56.777
and they were not intended
for Wide distribution.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.448
Yes, but it doesn't matter
What was intended.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.411
He wrote an e-mail

21:00.460 --> 21:03.588
that was widely distributed
by the recipient.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.350
Legally he is as responsible
as if he distributed it himself.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.595
Any questions, Mr. Canning?

21:09.630 --> 21:10.619
Let me handle this.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.695
Ah...

21:12.730 --> 21:13.890
Mr. Clove,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.737
What did Ms. Raker
say to you

21:15.770 --> 21:18.000
to elicit your offhand comment
that she was a homophobe?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.007
She said

21:19.040 --> 21:20.576
that gay people could be cured,

21:20.610 --> 21:22.635
and when I asked her
Why would they want to be,

21:22.680 --> 21:25.046
she said, because
What they did was disgusting.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.809
That's not
an exact quote,

21:26.850 --> 21:28.442
but I think
it's a pretty good paraphrase.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.617
Mr. Arbitrator,

21:29.650 --> 21:31.584
not only is this
not defamatory.

21:31.620 --> 21:34.612
Ms. Raker's comments are
hate speech, pure and Simple.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.059
Not only was Mr. Clove
Within his rights

21:36.090 --> 21:37.853
to warn others of
this hate speech,

21:37.890 --> 21:39.687
he was right
to fire her.

21:39.730 --> 21:41.550
I think some very good
points are being made

21:41.600 --> 21:42.999
and...

21:43.030 --> 21:46.761
I think the best thing to
do would be to adjourn.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.461
(gavelbangs)

21:48.500 --> 21:49.467
RAKER:
The other professors

21:49.500 --> 21:50.762
were making fun
of Rick Santorum

21:50.810 --> 21:53.062
for saying homosexual acts
were like bestiality.

21:53.110 --> 21:54.600
I was defending
him, that's all.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.733
I said his logic
made sense to me.

21:56.780 --> 21:57.849
You're a Christian,
right?

21:57.880 --> 22:00.849
I am-- CRC--
Christian Reformed.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.677
Okay, we need to get you
back on the stand tomorrow.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.517
ELI:
I got you

22:04.550 --> 22:05.778
the cheese account.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.549
You lost us the
cheese account.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.887
No. We all did that.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.683
The point is,
I made the effort;

22:10.730 --> 22:12.721
I didn't have to.
See? That's your problem.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.625
You think of it as a favor.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.127
This is What we do--
we share.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.969
I'm sharing.
I'm here, sharing.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.991
You came in here throwing
your weight around,

22:20.030 --> 22:21.691
not coming to staff meetings.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.038
You want me to come
to staff meetings.
I don't want anything.

22:24.070 --> 22:27.528
I'm explaining to you
Why you're not getting
anything in return.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.118
Okay, I will...
be more involved.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.717
There. Next.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.718
Why is Peter investigating me?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.751
I didn't know he was.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.678
He is.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.789
_ _You're still his_
political strategist, right?

22:48.830 --> 22:51.799
It's this for politics
or something else?

22:51.830 --> 22:54.139
I have no idea.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.491
Have you asked Alicia?

22:58.740 --> 22:59.809
I haven't told her.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.070
I didn't want_to make it
her busmess.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.169
But it is her business.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.802
Isn't it?

23:07.450 --> 23:09.418
What's he investigating?

23:09.450 --> 23:10.849
Corruption.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.585
There's nothing there.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.054
But if he's investigating
me, it hurts the firm.

23:15.090 --> 23:16.751
It hurts you.

23:16.790 --> 23:19.429
That's What sharing's all about:

23:19.460 --> 23:22.998
being part of the firm,
knowing that if I'm hurt...

23:23.030 --> 23:24.622
you're hurt.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.820
I will see what I can find out.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.462
Good.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.762
Thanks.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.961
GRACE:
"If anyone lie with a man

23:32.010 --> 23:35.502
"as with a woman, both have
committed an abomination,

23:35.540 --> 23:38.509
let them be put to death."

23:38.550 --> 23:39.505
So, What's that?

23:39.550 --> 23:41.768
Leviticus. Chapter 20.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.708
What's this for, a case?

23:43.750 --> 23:45.513
Yeah, wrongful
termination.

23:45.550 --> 23:48.781
Do you believe all this, Grace?

23:48.820 --> 23:50.185
(laughs softly)
I don't know.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.121
Like, some of the Bible
I get, and some I don't.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.957
Well, What about
your Uncle Owen?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.662
He's gay.
I know. That's the
part I don't get.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.918
I guess I thought...

23:59.970 --> 24:02.632
With your dancing and everything
you'd moved on.

24:02.670 --> 24:05.434
No. I can do both.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.071
I'm sorry I missed
your call yesterday.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.748
It's okay.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.771
Zach's a pretty
good driver.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.869
You don't have
to worry.
I'm not.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.048
Or I am, but...
not about that.

24:24.990 --> 24:26.821
What, then?

24:26.860 --> 24:28.794
I don't know.
Something.

24:28.830 --> 24:30.866
I just have to
shake it off.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.961
Is it about Will?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.709
Zach said he met him
in the office.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.504
No, it's not about Will.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.177
I'm...

24:49.750 --> 24:52.878
(choked up):
Grace, I'm sorry it's
been such a hard year.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.048
Are you good?

24:56.090 --> 24:58.957
Yeah. I just want to
make sure that you are.

24:58.990 --> 25:02.096
(laughs):
I am. I am.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.997
There's just too many
distractions right
now, that's all.

25:05.030 --> 25:07.021
Get rid of them.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.207
Okay, I will.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.176
So, you know him?

25:19.210 --> 25:21.178
_ Do I know the
investigator, Wiley?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.609
Yeah, I've met him.

25:23.650 --> 25:25.117
You think he's good?

25:25.150 --> 25:27.914
Are you really asking me for
references on a detective

25:27.960 --> 25:31.054
investigating
my firm?
Yes. Is that inappropriate?

25:32.860 --> 25:36.023
Wiley thinks you guys
buy your wins.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.767
Really?

25:38.800 --> 25:41.792
Well, What else do you need?

25:41.840 --> 25:45.264
You haven't slept
With Cary, have you?

25:47.710 --> 25:49.837
You talk a lot about sex.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.599
Well, I find it
interesting, don't you?

25:52.650 --> 25:55.016
Cary talks about you during sex.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.617
Really?

25:57.650 --> 25:58.844
Yeah.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.051
Want to know what he says?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.786
I think you want me
to know What he says.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.081
I could go either way.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.279
Yeah, you could.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.025
You flirt with everyone.

26:08.060 --> 26:13.066
It's a personal failing;
we seem to share that.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.169
No, we don't.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.704
When I start, I follow through.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.338
ALICIA:
"If anyone lie with a man

26:21.380 --> 26:25.077
as with a woman, both have
committed an abomination..."

26:25.110 --> 26:27.078
Leviticus 20:13.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.748
Do you believe that?
I do.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.042
But even if you didn't
want to believe it,

26:30.080 --> 26:31.240
you would have to believe it.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.349
I'm a member
of the Christian Reformed Church

26:33.390 --> 26:34.755
of North America.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.018
We believe the Bible is

26:36.060 --> 26:37.925
the authoritative
word of God.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.224
And so the speech
that Mr. Clove referred to

26:40.260 --> 26:42.296
as homophobic
was not hate-speech,

26:42.330 --> 26:44.696
it was religiously based speech?
In fact,

26:44.730 --> 26:46.698
I'm appalled that Mr. Clove
called me homophobic

26:46.730 --> 26:47.765
behind my back.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.233
If he asked,
I would explain

26:49.270 --> 26:51.204
my biblical
justification.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.730
ALICIA:
Thank you, Pamela.

26:52.770 --> 26:55.000
Unfortunately, Mrs. Florrick
didn't read far enough.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.735
What's the _next line
in LeVIticus?

26:56.780 --> 26:58.702
And those men
Who lie With men

26:58.750 --> 27:02.140
as they lieth with women,
the instruction is to kill them.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.374
Isn't it?

27:03.420 --> 27:05.718
That was an instruction
promulgated by Moses

27:05.750 --> 27:08.082
for the Levites.
Ah, so it doesn't
apply today?

27:08.120 --> 27:11.157
Because otherwise, you should be
out killing gay people, right?

27:11.190 --> 27:14.023
To say that Jesus' love
tempered the need for punishment

27:14.060 --> 27:16.654
doesn't change what is
considered right and wrong.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.429
Is Mr. Canning really
trying to determine

27:18.470 --> 27:19.994
What is religiously
based speech

27:20.030 --> 27:20.928
and what is not?

27:20.970 --> 27:24.758
The point is, Mr. Clove
defamed our client

27:24.810 --> 27:27.028
as homophobic,
When clearly he knew

27:27.070 --> 27:29.106
it was religiously based speech.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.244
Yes. Uh, Mr. Canning,
I think that's right.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.100
I don't really
think I'm here

27:33.150 --> 27:35.869
to sever any
Gordian knots.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.444
The question is not:
What is religious?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.141
The question is:
Did Mr. Clove

27:39.190 --> 27:41.408
know that Pamela
was religious?

27:41.460 --> 27:44.179
And with that question,

27:44.230 --> 27:47.028
I think we should
take... a short break.

27:47.060 --> 27:49.722
(gavelbangs)

27:52.230 --> 27:55.199
The arbitrator sounds
sympathetic towards us,
doesn't he?

27:56.740 --> 27:58.059
All right.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.003
What?

28:01.040 --> 28:03.201
Let's make a deal.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.317
She can't have her job back.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.750
Then she'll need money--
because your client
has made it difficult

28:13.790 --> 28:15.712
for her to get a job
anywhere else.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.113
You're coming to
my firm, Alicia.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.980
Iam?

28:22.260 --> 28:23.329
Will Gardner and
Diane Lockhart don't
have children; I do.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.392
And that matters why?

28:26.430 --> 28:29.331
Well, they like their
employees to work long
hours because...

28:29.370 --> 28:32.134
their work is their home.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.206
My hom is my home.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.970
I love my home.
I like my kids.

28:37.010 --> 28:40.946
You want to spend more
time With your kids, you
should be at my firm.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.847
You can work at home;
you can telecommute.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.915
I don't like your
clientele, Mr. Canning.

28:45.950 --> 28:48.089
That's right.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.417
My mean...

28:49.460 --> 28:51.052
corporate clients.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.250
Thank you.

28:52.290 --> 28:54.121
The one percent.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.993
Like Mr. Remiddi.
Used to be worth
$2 billion,

28:57.030 --> 28:59.362
until he gave half to
African AIDS research.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.992
Or Miss Lani Janklow.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.099
Started her own company.
Takes trips to Bolivia

29:03.140 --> 29:05.301
to develop micro-financing
in third world countries.

29:05.340 --> 29:07.934
Of course they're
no Donny Pike.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.039
We don't represent
Donny Pike.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.298
That's right, you
represent Colin Sweeney.

29:12.350 --> 29:14.170
Your phone's blinking.

29:17.050 --> 29:18.187
Hello? Grace?

29:18.220 --> 29:19.312
(static over phone)

29:19.350 --> 29:20.419
(beep)

29:36.340 --> 29:39.332
GRACE'S VOICE:
Hi. This is Grace.
Leave a message.

29:40.510 --> 29:42.478
What's wrong?

29:46.410 --> 29:48.071
AUTOMATED VOICE:
First v0ice message.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.089
MAN: Come on, get in the car.
GRACE: Where are we going?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.088
You'll see.
(engine starts)

29:53.120 --> 29:55.418
(indistinct voices)

29:55.460 --> 29:58.258
(message ends)

29:58.290 --> 29:59.484
Everything all right?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.192
Zach, hi. I, um...
(clears throat)

30:06.230 --> 30:07.527
Is Grace With you?

30:07.570 --> 30:09.492
Uh, no. Why?

30:09.540 --> 30:12.236
Well, she was trying to call me,
and I was in a meeting.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.601
Um, wh-Where is she?

30:13.640 --> 30:16.370
At school. I think. Why?

30:16.410 --> 30:18.002
Well, I thought
she was going With you.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.143
Yeah, she was. I just,
I had to stop by your office

30:20.180 --> 30:21.909
to work on your computer.
Did you tell her that?

30:21.950 --> 30:22.974
Yeah.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.180
Why? Mom, what's wrong?

30:24.220 --> 30:25.619
She tried calling 12 times,

30:25.650 --> 30:27.857
and I didn't hear it, and...

30:27.890 --> 30:29.915
Wh-Where would she be?

30:29.960 --> 30:30.949
At home, my guess.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.355
She would take the El home.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.449
Okay, I'll try her there.
Mom, she's fine.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.627
She probably just
butt-dialed you.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.026
(laughs):
Okay. Bye.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.828
(phone ringing)

30:49.010 --> 30:50.409
I have to go.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.647
Where you going?
Um, it's okay.
I'll take a cab.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.272
No, I have a driver;
I'll take you.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.275
No, it's really okay.
Mrs. Florrick,

30:55.320 --> 31:00.019
listen to me-- I have
a driver; I'll take you.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.018
ALICIA:
I'm going to the school.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.426
Zach, is there any...

31:04.460 --> 31:06.428
Zach, tell me the truth.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.428
Is there anyone she sees?

31:08.460 --> 31:10.098
Mom, you're getting me worried.
What's going on?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.429
No, no one.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.461
Okay. I'll wait here.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.229
You don't want me to...

31:19.270 --> 31:21.409
All right,
got it.

31:21.440 --> 31:24.238
My mom's freaking out.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.474
What's your sister's
cell number?

31:25.510 --> 31:26.977
GIRL:
Yeah, Grace and I

31:27.010 --> 31:30.116
usually hang out
after school, uh,
right here.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.516
So... you didn't see her?

31:32.550 --> 31:34.654
I-I did see her.
Where?

31:34.690 --> 31:38.456
Shannon, Where?
Is Grace in trouble,
Mrs. Florrick?

31:38.490 --> 31:40.424
Shannon, listen to me.

31:40.460 --> 31:43.964
I'm worried for my daughter,
and I need to find her,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.265
so if you did see her,
you need to help me find her.

31:48.970 --> 31:52.098
I saw her get into a car,
uh, With a man.

31:52.140 --> 31:55.177
I'm sorry. I thought he was
supposed to pick her up.

31:55.210 --> 31:57.633
I-I would have
said something.
What'd he look like?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.648
I-I don't know. He
walked her to his car.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.511
Was he tall?
Uh,

32:01.550 --> 32:02.676
yeah, sort of.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.483
Did they seem
to know each other?

32:04.520 --> 32:07.011
I-I don't know.
I'm sorry.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.517
(phone rings)

32:08.560 --> 32:09.652
Peter Florrick.

32:09.690 --> 32:11.988
ALICIA:
Peter, did you pick up Grace?

32:12.030 --> 32:13.622
Did I...? No.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.424
Why?

32:16.460 --> 32:17.552
What's the matter?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.227
Peter, I can't get ahold of her.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.591
Um, I tried her cell.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.969
I... She called me 12 times.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.637
I'm at school.
Where are you?

32:27.670 --> 32:30.036
Her friend said she saw her
get in a car With a man.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.672
What man?

32:31.710 --> 32:33.507
I don't know.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.472
Hold on. Cary.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.612
Get me Chief McCarthy

32:36.650 --> 32:38.709
in the next room right away--
he's in a budget meeting.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.342
Peter,

32:40.390 --> 32:42.483
you know we've been involved
With the Donny Pike case.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.509
I know, and it's not that.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.051
(crying): How do you know?
How do you know that?

32:46.090 --> 32:47.523
Alicia, listen to me.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.528
There is no reason

32:49.560 --> 32:50.527
for him to go there.

32:50.560 --> 32:51.720
Now, take a breath.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.136
Is Grace's friend next to you?

32:54.170 --> 32:55.762
Let me speak to her.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.529
(exhales)

32:57.570 --> 32:59.299
(sniffles) Shannon,
it's my husband.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.534
Please, can you...?

33:00.570 --> 33:02.106
Hello?

33:03.280 --> 33:05.669
(panting): Oh, please,
don't let it happen.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.598
D-Don't let it happen.
Don't let it...

33:07.650 --> 33:09.174
ZACH:
What is that?

33:09.220 --> 33:10.642
KALINDA:
Does your Sister know
anyone in Englewood?

33:10.680 --> 33:12.648
South Side? No.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.557
Why?
So, she'd have no
reason to go there?

33:15.590 --> 33:17.512
Is that Where her cell phone is?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.027
Oh, her cell phone is dead.

33:19.060 --> 33:20.254
That's the last known location.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.518
Does your sister do drugs?

33:21.560 --> 33:23.027
No.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.493
Zach, listen to me.

33:24.530 --> 33:25.462
If you're hiding something,
you need to tell me.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.421
I'm not.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.267
She doesn't use drugs.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.995
Okay.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.039
Kalinda, you
got a minute?
No.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.503
What's wrong?

33:40.080 --> 33:42.048
(phone ringing)

33:43.450 --> 33:46.248
(beep)

33:46.290 --> 33:48.417
What?
I told her

33:48.460 --> 33:49.279
to leave a note
on the refrigerator.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.129
Can your driver take me
to my apartment?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.252
Sure.

33:53.730 --> 33:56.426
I know your usual procedure
is to wait 24 hours

33:56.460 --> 33:58.360
before declaring
a missing person.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.594
That's not
happening here.

33:59.630 --> 34:00.562
This is my daughter.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.591
And you're gonna have
to start right now.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.232
Her friend is
waiting at school.

34:04.270 --> 34:07.159
I need you to get
a sketch artist there right now.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.379
I can't talk.

34:11.410 --> 34:12.707
1-1... I don't know.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.139
All right, all right,
just pause for a second,
take a deep breath.

34:15.180 --> 34:16.340
You all right?
Yeah.

34:16.380 --> 34:17.677
Now what did Grace
and you talk about?

34:17.720 --> 34:19.187
You ever talk
about any guys?

34:19.220 --> 34:20.312
(sirens approaching)
No. Uh, no one.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.615
No one she wants to see,
no one she even mentioned once?

34:23.660 --> 34:26.584
No, she's-she's not
interested in any of that.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.689
All right, and did she talk
to anyone online?

35:06.900 --> 35:09.664
(sighs)

35:13.510 --> 35:15.774
(keys jingling, door opening)

35:17.580 --> 35:18.740
(sighs)

35:18.780 --> 35:20.270
She's not at my place.

35:20.310 --> 35:23.177
Ithoughtshe
might be here.

35:26.490 --> 35:29.414
(crying)
Hold on.
Hold on.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.621
It's just been a few hours.

35:31.660 --> 35:34.220
It's probably nothing.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.778
(tires squealing,
engine rewing)

36:02.860 --> 36:06.318
I baptize you in the name
of the Father...

36:08.330 --> 36:10.150
...the Son...

36:20.510 --> 36:22.603
(sighs)

36:33.690 --> 36:35.749
(sighs)

36:40.360 --> 36:42.920
Is she angry?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.962
I don't know.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.689
(sighs)

36:48.740 --> 36:51.732
I was only gone an hour.

36:51.770 --> 36:54.637
And I didn't call her 12 times.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.636
The phone was in
my back pocket.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.671
I butt-called her.
(elevator bell dings)

37:03.750 --> 37:05.718
Aren't you coming?

37:05.750 --> 37:07.786
No.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.412
But my mom will
want to thank you.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.688
I'm fine.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.483
Should I tell her
that you found me?

37:12.530 --> 37:15.624
Uh... no.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.527
Okay, well, thanks
for the ride.

37:30.340 --> 37:33.002
GRACE:
Mom.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.745
Grace.

37:40.390 --> 37:43.587
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

37:43.620 --> 37:45.986
I'm so sorry.

37:47.860 --> 37:48.997
Dad.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.831
(elevator bell dings)

38:13.920 --> 38:15.410
Commitment.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.348
What do you think
of commitment?

38:17.390 --> 38:21.394
I think it's, it's
something people do.

38:21.430 --> 38:22.795
I saw Alicia
With her daughter,

38:22.830 --> 38:26.789
and I thought,
"Maybe I can do that."

38:29.900 --> 38:31.868
You don't think I can?

38:31.910 --> 38:35.937
No, I think you can
do What you want.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.333
What do you want?

38:37.380 --> 38:40.872
Something more than work.

38:40.910 --> 38:44.016
Kids?

38:44.050 --> 38:46.587
I don't know.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.885
I've spent my whole life
getting ahead.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.059
Sometimes I can't
figure out why.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.820
Do you know What
Alicia wants?

38:54.860 --> 38:56.851
No.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.765
But I'll ask.

39:00.800 --> 39:04.531
If you don't know
something, ask, right?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.808
CANNING:
Mr. Arbitrator,

39:12.850 --> 39:16.479
before we begin,
I need to present an exhibit.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.078
Certainly.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.917
What do you have for me,
Mr. Canning?

39:19.950 --> 39:24.887
It's an e-mail
from Pamela Raker to her sister

39:24.930 --> 39:27.148
just before she was let go.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.851
I-- it just came
into my possession.

39:28.900 --> 39:29.855
IfI may,

39:29.900 --> 39:31.094
uh, "Sis, I know
I'm not supposed

39:31.130 --> 39:32.722
"to hide my light
under a bushel,

39:32.770 --> 39:33.896
"but at this
job I have to.

39:33.930 --> 39:36.535
"My views get me into enough
shouting matches as it is.

39:36.570 --> 39:39.698
If they knew I was a testifying
Christian, I'd never get ahead."

39:39.740 --> 39:40.638
Objection, Mr. Arbitrator.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.833
Where did Mr. Canning obtain
this e-mail?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.744
Does it matter?

39:44.780 --> 39:47.476
If Ms. Raker actively hid
her beliefs,

39:47.510 --> 39:48.716
then Mr. Clove had no way

39:48.750 --> 39:50.115
of knowing she was,
in fact, religious.

39:50.150 --> 39:50.969
And you're correct--

39:51.020 --> 39:53.648
that is really
What's at stake here.

39:53.690 --> 39:54.782
Anything?

39:57.160 --> 39:59.481
Seriously?

39:59.530 --> 40:00.849
Yes, Mrs. Florrick?

40:00.890 --> 40:03.051
I was waiting
for my daughter to come home,

40:03.100 --> 40:05.796
and you took that moment
to steal into my bag?

40:05.830 --> 40:07.718
No.
You took advantage

40:07.770 --> 40:09.089
of my situation.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.698
I did not.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.662
I'm a parent, as are you,

40:12.710 --> 40:15.076
and I would never do
anything like that.
Oh, come on, Mr. Canning.

40:15.110 --> 40:17.032
Then how did you get
a copy of that e-mail?

40:17.080 --> 40:19.469
I waited till your
daughter was safe.

40:19.510 --> 40:20.977
Then I looked in your bag.

40:21.010 --> 40:23.740
Are you serious?

40:23.780 --> 40:26.613
Yes. If your daughter
hadn't returned home,
I wouldn't have looked.

40:26.650 --> 40:27.685
I'm not a monster.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.554
And I still want you to
come work for our firm.

40:31.590 --> 40:34.559
Alicia, you had a...
bad day today.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.851
You got beat.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.788
I know you think
we're cutthroat,

40:37.830 --> 40:38.899
and I guess...

40:38.930 --> 40:40.591
we are.

40:40.630 --> 40:43.861
But you'll always be home
in time to see your kids.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.107
And that's something
to think about.

40:46.140 --> 40:49.109
So don't answer me now;
just think about it, but...

40:49.140 --> 40:52.007
kids need their parents.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.039
(exhales)

41:10.960 --> 41:12.621
(sighs)

41:17.300 --> 41:18.733
Hi, Will.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.032
Hi.

41:20.070 --> 41:22.834
It seems like I haven't
seen you in a while.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.643
I know.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.773
I heard everything's
good With your daughter.

41:26.810 --> 41:27.947
Yes, thank you.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.641
(whispers):
Will...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.011
Yes?

41:38.060 --> 41:40.756
I can't.
It's too much.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.090
(crying):
I'm sorry.

41:44.930 --> 41:48.127
(exhales)
I'm sorry.

41:48.170 --> 41:51.708
I'm gonna miss you.
Mm.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.961
*

42:48.630 --> 42:50.791
You did the right thing.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.297
(softly):
She'll get over it.

42:57.170 --> 42:59.058
Yep.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.035
She will.
