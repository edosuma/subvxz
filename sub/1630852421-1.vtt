00:39.908 --> 00:42.116
<i>What's missing
from this picture?</i>

00:44.068 --> 00:45.668
<i>We'll start with extraction,</i>

00:45.699 --> 00:48.483
<i>which is a fancy word
for trashing the planet.</i>

00:48.515 --> 00:50.627
<i>But this looks like
is we chop down the trees,</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.645
<i>we blow up the mountains
to get the metals inside</i>

00:52.676 --> 00:54.211
<i>and use up all the water,</i>

00:54.243 --> 00:56.355
<i>and we wipe out the animals.</i>

00:58.597 --> 01:01.155
<i>We are running out
of resources.</i>

01:01.187 --> 01:03.268
<i>Now, I know this can be hard
to hear, but it's the truth.</i>

01:03.301 --> 01:06.052
<i>So we've got to deal with it.</i>

01:06.085 --> 01:07.811
<i>In the past
three decades alone,</i>

01:07.844 --> 01:10.052
<i>one-third of the planet's
natural resource space</i>

01:10.084 --> 01:11.908
<i>has been consumed.</i>

01:11.941 --> 01:13.475
<i>Gone.</i>

01:13.508 --> 01:15.268
<i>We are cutting and mining
and hauling</i>

01:15.299 --> 01:17.668
<i>and trashing the place so fast
that we're undermining</i>

01:17.701 --> 01:21.251
<i>the planet's very ability
for people to live here.</i>

01:21.284 --> 01:23.588
<i>We have 5%
of the world's population,</i>

01:23.620 --> 01:26.819
<i>but we're using 30%
of the world's resources.</i>

01:26.851 --> 01:29.699
<i>If everybody consumed
at U.S. rates,</i>

01:29.731 --> 01:32.579
<i>we would need
three to five planets.</i>

01:32.611 --> 01:34.724
<i>And you know what?</i>

01:34.755 --> 01:36.611
<i>We've only got one.</i>

02:29.701 --> 02:31.043
Oh, my God.

03:07.876 --> 03:10.659
You live in that?

03:10.692 --> 03:13.732
Seriously?

03:19.748 --> 03:22.179
Does your chicken have a name?

03:26.915 --> 03:27.875
Chicken.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.252
Chicken?

03:29.284 --> 03:31.300
Chicken.

03:31.332 --> 03:34.724
Where's all your stuff?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.940
I divested.

03:35.972 --> 03:37.860
Cut myself down
to a hundred things.

03:37.892 --> 03:40.452
What do you mean,
a hundred things?

03:40.484 --> 03:42.724
Shirt's one thing,
bowl's one thing,

03:42.756 --> 03:46.468
fork, sleeping bag, chicken.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.196
And you kept that hat?

03:51.460 --> 03:53.667
Tell me you at least have a gun.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.531
Jesus, Waldo.

04:01.892 --> 04:04.452
When's the last time
you had anybody up here?

04:04.484 --> 04:05.796
Three years.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.684
You got any friends?

04:07.716 --> 04:09.955
Chicken.

04:13.348 --> 04:14.883
Wow.

04:14.915 --> 04:18.276
What the fuck is that?

04:18.308 --> 04:20.515
I bought the land
from a sculptor.

04:20.547 --> 04:24.644
Sure, because this spoke to you,
right?

04:26.596 --> 04:29.668
Remember that time
we were supposedly "broken up"?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.748
I ran into you outside
the art museum on Wilshire.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.636
I was on a date.

04:33.668 --> 04:35.300
I ditched the guy.

04:35.332 --> 04:37.795
We went straight to your truck
in the parking structure.

04:39.268 --> 04:41.635
It was right next to
the La Brea Tar Pits.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.004
By the mammoths.

04:44.036 --> 04:45.732
Okay.

04:45.764 --> 04:47.748
First of all,
this isn't a mammoth.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.379
It's an elephant.

04:49.411 --> 04:52.388
Second of all, you're saying
I bought this property

04:52.420 --> 04:54.500
because I had a subconscious
sexual memory

04:54.532 --> 04:56.292
prompted by this sculpture.

04:56.324 --> 04:59.268
Which you brought me straight to
the minute I came to visit you.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.803
Uninvited.

05:03.364 --> 05:05.060
Look, I'm here on business.

05:05.092 --> 05:07.780
- Alastair Pinch, the actor...
- Killed his wife.

05:07.812 --> 05:10.724
Look, maybe he killed her,
maybe he didn't.

05:10.756 --> 05:13.540
I don't think he even knows.
The guy's a blackout drunk.

05:13.572 --> 05:15.267
The network's got a lot riding
on him,

05:15.299 --> 05:16.516
so they're paying
for his lawyer.

05:16.548 --> 05:17.668
So he did kill her.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.332
It means the money's serious.

05:19.364 --> 05:21.027
They're looking to hire a P.I.

05:21.059 --> 05:24.420
This gig could jump me
to the majors.

05:24.452 --> 05:26.308
If I could deliver the famous
Charlie Waldo

05:26.340 --> 05:29.316
to work it with me...

05:29.348 --> 05:30.756
Come on.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.156
You know these Hollywood types.

05:33.188 --> 05:35.780
They always want to put
a big name in it.

05:35.812 --> 05:38.307
I'm retired.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.324
I see that.

05:40.356 --> 05:43.075
From the force.

05:43.107 --> 05:46.436
I'd be willing to go 80/20,
yours.

05:46.468 --> 05:48.292
What would I even do
with the money?

05:48.324 --> 05:50.532
Buy a nicer hundred things.

05:50.564 --> 05:52.164
'Cause then my life
would be complete?

05:52.196 --> 05:53.603
Exactly.

05:55.587 --> 05:58.116
Pass.

05:58.148 --> 05:59.780
Lydell was a long time ago.

05:59.812 --> 06:00.996
Lorena.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.436
You don't have to
keep punishing yourself.

06:02.468 --> 06:03.556
You don't have to
live like this.

06:03.588 --> 06:05.284
You don't have to
live like that.

06:05.316 --> 06:07.588
Fuck, you expect me
to apologize?

06:07.620 --> 06:09.091
Hey, I grew up poor.

06:09.124 --> 06:12.835
For-real poor,
not with solar panels.

06:12.867 --> 06:16.100
Bye.

06:16.132 --> 06:18.980
Come on, let me bring you back
into the real world.

06:19.012 --> 06:23.044
Just for a few weeks.
We'll have some laughs.

06:23.076 --> 06:24.772
I can't.

06:27.364 --> 06:31.460
All right.
It was worth a shot.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.084
Can I have a hug at least?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.788
You ghosted me, Waldo.

06:44.644 --> 06:46.820
I ghosted everybody.

06:46.852 --> 06:49.636
I know.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.876
You smell better than you look.

06:58.724 --> 07:00.548
You can't stay up here forever.

07:00.579 --> 07:03.715
No? Why not?

07:03.748 --> 07:07.588
Same reason you and I
kept hooking back up.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.604
Unfinished business is a bitch.

07:18.244 --> 07:19.492
<i>Things are not looking good</i>

07:19.524 --> 07:21.444
<i>for celebrated actor
Alastair Pinch.</i>

07:21.476 --> 07:23.875
<i>He's under renewed scrutiny
by the LAPD</i>

07:23.908 --> 07:25.348
<i>regarding the murder
of his wife,</i>

07:25.380 --> 07:27.140
<i>Monica Pinch, two weeks ago.</i>

07:27.172 --> 07:29.379
<i>Investigators say they are
focusing their inquiries</i>

07:29.412 --> 07:32.292
<i>on the actor himself
as the prime suspect.</i>

07:56.228 --> 07:58.500
Jesus, Waldo.

08:02.436 --> 08:04.195
You know, you shouldn't do that.

08:04.228 --> 08:06.500
Call a cop.

08:06.532 --> 08:09.091
Mm.

08:09.124 --> 08:10.659
Mm.

08:13.604 --> 08:17.220
Lorena Nascimento was out here
a couple days ago, huh?

08:17.252 --> 08:20.228
Oh, yeah? I'd have to check
my visitor's log.

08:20.259 --> 08:21.764
Don't jerk me.

08:21.796 --> 08:24.451
She's been scoping you
for the Pinch murder.

08:24.484 --> 08:28.260
That dumb bastard's
the least of her worries.

08:28.291 --> 08:29.763
She say anything about Don Q?

08:29.796 --> 08:31.492
Is he a game show host?

08:31.524 --> 08:33.188
Captain of industry.

08:33.220 --> 08:36.227
A recreational pharmaceutical
industry.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.316
Your girl's on his payroll.

08:37.347 --> 08:38.820
That sounds like bullshit.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.164
Oh, that's not bullshit.

08:40.196 --> 08:41.828
You check out her ride?

08:41.860 --> 08:43.620
Where do you think she gets
that kind of cheese?

08:43.650 --> 08:46.116
Where does a cop with four kids
get the cheese for a 'Vette?

08:46.148 --> 08:48.388
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You dropped this.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.828
Fucking dick.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.188
Anyway, she took something
that belonged to Don Q.

08:53.220 --> 08:54.756
Not exactly
the healthiest lifestyle choice.

08:54.788 --> 08:59.523
And what I think is she came up
here to leave it with you.

08:59.556 --> 09:01.060
Leave what?

09:01.091 --> 09:02.532
And if you're smart,
you will give it to me.

09:02.564 --> 09:04.708
I don't know what it is.
I haven't seen her.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.148
Stop wasting my time, man.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.651
The last thing she did
on a computer

09:07.684 --> 09:09.028
was Google Map this ass pile.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.108
The last call on her cell
was from Idyllwild.

09:11.139 --> 09:12.932
What do you mean last call?

09:12.963 --> 09:14.436
There a missing-persons open?

09:14.468 --> 09:15.748
Hell no.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.604
That would require
somebody gave a shit.

09:17.636 --> 09:20.643
What?

09:20.676 --> 09:22.467
Oh, Jesus.

09:46.563 --> 09:47.940
<i>This is Lorena.</i>

09:47.971 --> 09:49.284
<i>You can leave a message,</i>

09:49.316 --> 09:51.140
<i>but if you want me
to call you back,</i>

09:51.172 --> 09:52.996
<i>you better make it interesting.</i>

10:01.860 --> 10:03.876
Fuck you, Lorena.

10:18.628 --> 10:20.067
Damn!

10:22.628 --> 10:23.876
Yo, hit him again.

10:23.907 --> 10:24.996
Come on.
Hit him again.

10:25.028 --> 10:28.388
- Hit him.
- Ooh!

10:28.420 --> 10:30.660
Oh, he gonna
fuck your white ass up.

10:30.692 --> 10:32.131
Hit him again.
Hit him again.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.284
Wait, wait, wait!

10:33.316 --> 10:34.948
Here we go.
Hit him again.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.196
Whatever the problem is here,

10:36.227 --> 10:40.996
let's see if we can...
communicate.

10:41.027 --> 10:42.372
Is that a purse?

10:42.404 --> 10:43.972
It's a Bottega, motherfucker.

10:44.004 --> 10:45.475
Oh, shit.

10:49.604 --> 10:52.195
Oh, shit. What the fuck
did you hit him with?

10:52.228 --> 10:53.572
Yeah. Yeah.

10:53.604 --> 10:55.364
Yo, come on, big man.

10:55.396 --> 10:57.091
Bam, then that's it.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.563
That's the one.

10:58.596 --> 11:00.324
Come on, big fella.

11:00.356 --> 11:04.100
- Oh, that's it. That's it.
- What do you morons want?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.828
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.196
Relax, big man.

11:08.228 --> 11:11.076
We want you to stay your ass up
on this motherfucking mountain.

11:11.108 --> 11:12.804
And stay away from
Alastair Pinch.

11:12.836 --> 11:14.468
Yeah. That's right.
And if you don't,

11:14.500 --> 11:15.651
you gonna get more visits from

11:15.684 --> 11:17.763
the Palisade Posse,
motherfucker.

11:20.773 --> 11:22.084
The fuck is wrong with him?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.108
Help me up.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.579
Come on.

11:24.613 --> 11:25.828
Yo, what are you doing?

11:25.860 --> 11:27.267
He's asking for help.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.740
What the fuck are you doing?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.212
I hate to break it
to you, boys...

11:30.243 --> 11:32.867
I've got nothing to do
with Alastair Pinch.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.179
Bullshit.

11:34.213 --> 11:36.003
You work for the network.
It's in the trades.

11:36.036 --> 11:38.724
Let me see.

11:38.756 --> 11:39.747
Boom.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.860
It's upside-down, moron.

11:44.420 --> 11:45.988
Yeah, that's right.

11:46.019 --> 11:47.653
What the fuck?

11:47.684 --> 11:49.220
Knock him out, dawg.
Come on.

11:52.484 --> 11:55.172
Just stay your hillbilly ass
out of L.A., bitch.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.940
<i>This is Lorena.
You can leave a message,</i>

13:07.971 --> 13:10.020
<i>but if you want me
to call you back,</i>

13:10.052 --> 13:11.173
<i>you better make it interesting.</i>

13:11.204 --> 13:12.836
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

13:12.867 --> 13:14.820
<i>and cannot accept new messages
at this time.</i>

14:00.580 --> 14:01.957
Mr. Waldo.

14:01.988 --> 14:03.844
Wilson Sikorsky,
head of the network.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.235
Hop in. You know Fontella Davis,
Alastair Pinch's attorney?

14:07.268 --> 14:08.773
Never had the pleasure.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.340
Hold on. Hang on.
Hang on.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.004
No.
No, I'm not paying him $40,000.

14:12.035 --> 14:14.755
I'll pay him $25,000.
He should be kissing my balls.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.196
What was the last series he had?

14:16.227 --> 14:17.859
Two years, he'll be playing
Sasquatch

14:17.891 --> 14:19.044
on the Discovery Channel.

14:19.076 --> 14:21.924
Hey, why would you
put in the trades

14:21.956 --> 14:23.555
that I was working
for your network?

14:23.588 --> 14:24.901
Mr. Waldo, when you land a star,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.308
you don't hide him
under your ass.

14:26.339 --> 14:27.684
You tell the whole
fucking world.

14:27.716 --> 14:29.444
You were the youngest ever
captain of the LAPD.

14:29.475 --> 14:30.531
Did we get that right?

14:30.564 --> 14:32.195
Youngest Detective III.

14:32.228 --> 14:34.084
Yeah, close enough.
We want you to start right away

14:34.115 --> 14:36.517
even though Lorena Nascimento
seems unavailable.

14:36.548 --> 14:39.301
She's missing. When's the last
time you talked to her?

14:39.332 --> 14:42.308
No. No.
Fuck no.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.844
That I can work with.
Then you do your homework.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.188
She's gonna be
exactly like a mother.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.619
- You have kids, Mr. Waldo?
- No.

14:47.651 --> 14:49.571
I'm gonna give you my cellphone.

14:49.604 --> 14:51.364
Don't call the office.
My new assistant's a fuckwit.

14:51.395 --> 14:52.547
But call me day or night,
though.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.179
I got to get this tied up.

14:54.211 --> 14:56.195
You may or may not be aware
I'm facing a takeover.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.988
And I won't you on NCN
with me tonight.

14:58.019 --> 15:00.004
I assume you know
how to find a barbershop.

15:00.035 --> 15:01.891
Hey, guys.

15:01.924 --> 15:05.188
Thing is, I never told Lorena
I'd do this.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.228
Sorry.

15:08.260 --> 15:09.635
So I tell you
my nuts are in a vise,

15:09.668 --> 15:11.876
you give them an extra turn?

15:11.908 --> 15:14.755
You want more money,
just have your reps call me.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.804
The show's worth twice now
what it used to be.

15:16.837 --> 15:19.139
This murder thing has done
wonders for the ratings.

15:19.171 --> 15:20.516
I could probably get
$6 mill an ep,

15:20.548 --> 15:22.084
but, you know,
I got to have 100 episodes,

15:22.115 --> 15:23.461
and I only got 57.

15:23.492 --> 15:25.891
So I need two more years
of... watch the cable...

15:25.924 --> 15:28.899
Alastair Pinch healthy,
happy, and off of death row.

15:28.931 --> 15:30.788
I can't take this.

15:30.819 --> 15:32.197
I only own 100 things.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.084
If I take that,
it's gonna be 101, you know?

15:34.117 --> 15:35.140
Not really.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.579
Well, it's complicated.

15:36.611 --> 15:38.371
Let's go with
one of the other P.I.s.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.228
I know we said we needed
to create distraction.

15:40.259 --> 15:41.540
But this?
Come on.

15:41.571 --> 15:43.108
Big fan of your work too.

15:43.139 --> 15:45.091
A real P.I., one that knows
how to do the job,

15:45.124 --> 15:47.139
- not just some has-been.
- All right. Look.

15:47.171 --> 15:48.548
Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.301
I'm only here to tell you
to put out a press release

15:51.332 --> 15:53.027
that says I'm not involved,
all right?

15:53.060 --> 15:54.788
That I turned it down.
Can you do that?

15:54.819 --> 15:55.940
This is the hottest gig in town.

15:55.971 --> 15:57.635
Everybody's chasing it.

15:57.668 --> 15:59.780
Here's what I'll do.
I'll introduce you to Alastair.

15:59.811 --> 16:01.828
I'll pay you for the day whether
you take the case or not.

16:01.861 --> 16:06.243
Excuse me.
Hey. Yeah. No. I'm on...

16:06.275 --> 16:08.131
What was Lorena gonna charge?

16:08.163 --> 16:10.628
- $1,000 a day plus expenses.
- $2,000, and not to me.

16:10.660 --> 16:13.412
A donation to the Sierra Club
in memory of Lydell Lipps.

16:13.444 --> 16:15.715
Deal. It's a shame
the kids are gonna miss this.

16:15.748 --> 16:18.308
You're about to meet
a motherfucking legend.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.965
So,
Stevie and I were at my estate.

16:20.996 --> 16:22.435
I was drinking absinthe,

16:22.468 --> 16:23.747
and several snifters in,

16:23.780 --> 16:26.499
I decided that this would be
the perfect night

16:26.531 --> 16:29.283
to teach Stevie Wonder
how to drive.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.644
And that it might be
most entertaining

16:32.677 --> 16:36.548
to let him motor about the lawn
with me outside the car,

16:36.580 --> 16:38.276
- trying to dodge it.
- Excuse me.

16:38.308 --> 16:39.492
I need a shoot, Mr. Pinch.

16:39.524 --> 16:41.412
Oh, thank you, cherub.

16:41.444 --> 16:44.005
Anyway, I thought I'd give
Stevie a sporting chance.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.212
So there I was,
trousers around my ankles,

16:46.244 --> 16:49.411
Stevie gave it some stick,
and I spent the next fortnight

16:49.443 --> 16:51.619
pissing claret in Ward C.

16:51.652 --> 16:53.636
Where's my mustache fluffer?

16:53.668 --> 16:55.780
Last looks.

16:55.812 --> 16:58.692
Let me know when we're set.

16:58.724 --> 17:00.995
<i>Grazie,</i> babies.

17:01.028 --> 17:02.372
Ohh.

17:02.404 --> 17:03.939
Sustained.

17:03.971 --> 17:05.188
"Sustrained."

17:05.221 --> 17:06.627
So stained.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.875
Is he shit-faced?

17:07.906 --> 17:09.188
Come on.

17:11.811 --> 17:14.403
It is such a privilege
to get to watch this man work.

17:14.435 --> 17:15.652
He's got a shitload
of Shakespeare Awards

17:15.685 --> 17:16.867
under his bed.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.435
Greatest fucking actor
since Brando.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.068
I get him Wednesday nights
after Jessica Biel.

17:20.098 --> 17:22.211
Love this job.

17:22.243 --> 17:24.291
Background.

17:24.325 --> 17:27.428
And... action!

17:27.460 --> 17:29.188
Let me tell you a story

17:29.221 --> 17:32.675
from when I was just a tyke
in Tuscaloosa.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.395
My granddaddy,
Raymond Forbishaw,

17:35.427 --> 17:36.836
he was a jurist himself.

17:36.868 --> 17:38.725
Family court.

17:38.756 --> 17:41.701
He used to set me on his knee
and say,

17:41.732 --> 17:45.541
"Johnnie, for 99 days,
the judge's job

17:45.572 --> 17:49.476
is merely to be that blindfold
on the statue of Lady Justice.

17:49.508 --> 17:53.188
For 99 days, you do that,
and justice,

17:53.221 --> 17:56.260
in its natural wisdom,
will find its own way.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.467
But, Johnnie," he'd say...

18:02.980 --> 18:05.348
"...on the 100th day,

18:05.379 --> 18:10.596
a great judge knows
that he needs to <i>be</i> justice."

18:10.628 --> 18:13.891
Now, I wouldn't be so bold as to
call myself a great judge,

18:13.923 --> 18:17.795
but I do know
that as I sit here today,

18:17.828 --> 18:20.771
I'm thinking about
my granddaddy.

18:20.804 --> 18:23.651
And that's why
I'm gonna direct this verdict

18:23.684 --> 18:28.580
and find this here defendant...
guilty.

18:28.612 --> 18:30.565
Cut!

18:30.596 --> 18:32.324
Alastair, that was terrific.

18:32.356 --> 18:34.660
Terrific?
It was bloody genius.

18:34.692 --> 18:36.484
You're not going
to top that one.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.019
I'll see you all tomorrow then.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.747
Did you hear what I just said?

18:39.779 --> 18:41.635
He's supposed to say
"not guilty."

18:41.667 --> 18:44.579
- He said guilty.
- Fuck.

18:44.611 --> 18:45.925
Could have just told me
I had ass cancer.

18:45.956 --> 18:46.948
Sorry.

18:46.981 --> 18:48.708
- Alastair.
- Yes?

18:48.740 --> 18:51.428
Oh, God,
I hate to do this to you,

18:51.459 --> 18:53.540
but we're gonna have
to do one more.

18:53.572 --> 18:56.388
- The last line is "not guilty."
- "Not guilty."

18:56.420 --> 18:58.019
- What did I say?
- Guilty.

18:58.051 --> 19:00.196
- The fuck I did.
- Yeah, he didn't say that.

19:00.228 --> 19:01.795
Did... I mean,
but really, just please?

19:01.827 --> 19:03.044
No.
I know what I said, love.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.675
So let's just look
at the playback.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.276
He wouldn't have said that.

19:06.308 --> 19:08.643
Can we just see
the playback, please?

19:08.675 --> 19:10.531
You... What are you smirking at?

19:10.563 --> 19:12.515
What? I didn't say anything.

19:12.548 --> 19:14.948
Do you think it's easy
to carry this piece of shit

19:14.980 --> 19:16.708
on my shoulders week after week?

19:16.740 --> 19:18.339
You think I need a twat like you

19:18.372 --> 19:20.099
standing there
hoping I'll cock it up?

19:20.131 --> 19:22.468
How long have you worked
on the show?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.068
It's my first week.

19:24.099 --> 19:26.372
Your first week.
It's his first week, everyone.

19:33.635 --> 19:35.108
God!

19:35.140 --> 19:36.483
<i>And that's why I'm gonna</i>

19:36.515 --> 19:37.732
<i>direct this verdict...</i>

19:37.765 --> 19:39.267
Let that be a lesson to you.

19:39.299 --> 19:41.412
- You good?
- I'm fine.

19:41.444 --> 19:42.436
<i>...guilty.</i>

19:42.468 --> 19:43.525
Let's do this.
Come on.

19:43.556 --> 19:45.572
Let's do it. Let's roll.

19:45.604 --> 19:47.556
Rolling!

19:47.588 --> 19:48.995
Does that happen often?

19:49.028 --> 19:51.076
Sometimes after lunch.

19:51.108 --> 19:53.699
We always put a stunt guy
right there, pay him extra.

19:53.731 --> 19:55.236
Don't tell Alastair.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.212
Ready?

19:58.244 --> 19:59.812
Action.

19:59.845 --> 20:02.275
"...and find
this here defendant

20:02.307 --> 20:04.259
not guilty."

20:04.291 --> 20:07.171
Cut!

20:07.203 --> 20:10.115
Wouldn't be the first time
I've had the clap.

20:22.628 --> 20:25.028
<i>Entrez.</i>

20:25.060 --> 20:27.588
"Not guilty."

20:27.620 --> 20:30.596
Ah, lord of the manor, down to
slum a bit with the vassals.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.195
To what do we owe the honor?

20:32.228 --> 20:34.596
I wanted to introduce you
to Charlie Waldo,

20:34.628 --> 20:36.260
the detective we told you about.

20:36.292 --> 20:38.020
He used to be king shit
at the LAPD.

20:38.052 --> 20:39.940
Ah, the fallen angel.
You've landed him.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.380
Didn't I promise you I would?

20:41.412 --> 20:42.884
I'd give you the shirt
off my back. You know that.

20:42.916 --> 20:44.772
I'd prefer the watch
off your wrist.

20:44.804 --> 20:46.563
Have you seen
what this man wears?

20:46.596 --> 20:48.419
Costs more than the house
I grew up in.

20:48.451 --> 20:51.363
Kudoke Skeleton.
They only make 35 a year.

20:51.396 --> 20:52.836
Maybe I'll make you
a wrap gift of one. How's that?

20:52.868 --> 20:54.724
Can we have that
signed in blood?

20:54.756 --> 20:56.740
"Signed in blood,"
he says.

20:56.772 --> 20:59.236
I'm done for the day, Detective.
Do you have plans?

20:59.268 --> 21:01.092
- Where do you live?
- Idyllwild.

21:01.124 --> 21:03.460
- I'm only here for today.
- Details we're sorting out.

21:03.492 --> 21:05.796
I haven't agreed
to take this case.

21:05.828 --> 21:07.236
I'll find a hotel for tonight.

21:07.268 --> 21:08.579
Nonsense.
You'll stay at my house.

21:08.611 --> 21:09.764
Great idea.

21:09.796 --> 21:11.172
Right to the scene of the crime.

21:11.204 --> 21:12.548
You don't mind sleeping

21:12.580 --> 21:14.307
surrounded by yellow tape,
do you?

21:14.339 --> 21:17.444
This fucking guy.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.564
Come on, Waldo.
What do you say?

21:18.596 --> 21:19.556
What's the worst
that can happen?

21:19.588 --> 21:21.059
Lorena turns up in a day or two,

21:21.091 --> 21:23.971
you can go back
to wherever you came from.

21:24.004 --> 21:26.052
Hell, maybe even get
your reputation back.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.196
Just kidding.

21:35.844 --> 21:39.331
Interest you
in a wee snifter, Detective?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.508
No, thank you.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.820
I deplore drinking alone,

21:42.852 --> 21:44.324
so I'll have a double.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.308
She was so proud of this room.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.100
Chin-chin.

21:52.132 --> 21:55.748
It was in <i>Town and Wanker</i>
magazine, you know.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.403
Why don't you walk me
through that morning?

22:02.084 --> 22:03.812
All right.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.540
One more time.

22:08.131 --> 22:10.148
It was a Saturday.

22:10.180 --> 22:13.891
I woke up... or came to...
in my study,

22:13.924 --> 22:16.804
about a half a mile
down that way.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.812
I realized I had no recollection
of the previous night.

22:19.844 --> 22:23.908
I came in here.
Found my sweet Monica.

22:25.796 --> 22:29.859
I ran back to the kitchen,
dialed 911.

22:29.892 --> 22:33.412
There was a shattered vase.

22:33.444 --> 22:35.300
Anyhow,
when the ambulance arrived,

22:35.332 --> 22:36.996
they told me
she was already gone

22:37.028 --> 22:39.715
and had been
for quite some time.

22:42.212 --> 22:44.964
Does anyone else have keys?

22:44.996 --> 22:47.812
Only Rosario. That's our nanny.

22:47.844 --> 22:50.500
And she was in Venezuela
visiting her family.

22:50.532 --> 22:51.876
Nanny?

22:51.908 --> 22:53.540
You have kids in the house?

22:53.572 --> 22:56.452
Yes.
We have one child, Gaby.

22:56.484 --> 22:58.180
She likely wasn't
the killer either,

22:58.212 --> 23:00.260
but she'll be home
from kindergarten soon enough

23:00.292 --> 23:03.140
if you think it's worth
trying to wrest a confession.

23:03.172 --> 23:05.316
Pretty glib, considering.

23:05.348 --> 23:06.852
Forgive me.

23:06.884 --> 23:09.700
Dear Gaby doesn't even know,
of course, but...

23:11.684 --> 23:14.404
...the world is certain
I murdered my wife, Mr. Waldo,

23:14.436 --> 23:17.796
and I can't even tell you
the world is wrong.

23:17.828 --> 23:20.420
If you know a man who's handled
a similar predicament

23:20.452 --> 23:22.948
with more élan, point me to him,

23:22.980 --> 23:25.860
and I shall gladly emulate.

23:25.891 --> 23:28.132
You ever thought about trying
to stop drinking?

23:31.268 --> 23:34.179
All the time.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.956
But this doesn't seem the week
for that, now, does it?

23:37.988 --> 23:39.331
Daddy!

23:39.364 --> 23:41.540
Princess Ozma,
where did you come from?

23:41.572 --> 23:43.300
Oh, oh, oh.

23:43.332 --> 23:46.436
Want to hear the song Little Dog
taught us at school today?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.868
A little dog?
Why, yes, of course.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.100
♪ Brush every morning,
brush every night ♪

23:52.132 --> 23:56.196
♪ I brush and I brush
so my teeth will be white ♪

23:56.228 --> 23:59.524
♪ Teeth can be shiny,
teeth can be gold ♪

23:59.556 --> 24:03.492
♪ I hope I still have some
when I'm very old ♪

24:04.836 --> 24:06.564
- You know it.
- I do know it, Gaby.

24:06.596 --> 24:10.692
I'd like to meet my new friend,
Mr. Waldo.

24:10.724 --> 24:13.988
He looks scary. Like a lion.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.748
Yeah, but he's a friendly lion.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.884
Gaby and I are going to spend
some daddy time before bed,

24:18.916 --> 24:20.804
you snuggly baby.

24:20.836 --> 24:25.732
Oh, you haven't decided
to take the case yet, have you?

24:25.764 --> 24:27.428
What say you, Detective?

24:27.460 --> 24:30.756
Will you return to your mountain
and leave me to the fates?

24:30.788 --> 24:33.028
Or will you stick around
the shitty of the angels

24:33.060 --> 24:36.612
long enough to see the police
maybe get it right this time?

24:36.644 --> 24:38.403
Whatever right may look like.

24:38.436 --> 24:41.796
Daddy, can Mr. Lion drive
to school with us tomorrow?

24:41.828 --> 24:43.748
Can he please?

24:43.780 --> 24:45.796
Please?

24:47.747 --> 24:49.604
Yay!

24:55.779 --> 24:57.476
Will this be all right?

24:59.684 --> 25:01.091
It's perfect.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.604
Fucking Lorena.

25:32.292 --> 25:35.812
<i>Guilty.</i>

25:35.844 --> 25:37.348
<i>...and turn down the volume
on the media circus.</i>

25:37.380 --> 25:38.627
<i>Oh, come on, Fontella.</i>

25:38.660 --> 25:40.388
<i>You live for the media circus.</i>

25:40.420 --> 25:41.732
<i>Now I'm hearing there could be
an indictment</i>

25:41.763 --> 25:43.140
<i>as early as tomorrow.</i>

25:43.171 --> 25:44.612
<i>We've not been told that.</i>

25:44.643 --> 25:46.020
<i>And now the</i> L.A. Times
<i>is reporting</i>

25:46.051 --> 25:47.396
<i>that sources on the LAPD say</i>

25:47.427 --> 25:49.252
<i>there are no
unidentified fingerprints</i>

25:49.284 --> 25:50.372
<i>anywhere in that room.</i>

25:50.403 --> 25:51.940
<i>What does that suggest to you?</i>

25:51.971 --> 25:53.252
<i>It suggests that
the real killer</i>

25:53.283 --> 25:54.788
<i>knew what he was doing.</i>

25:54.820 --> 25:55.811
<i>You promised us
Charlie Waldo</i>

25:55.844 --> 25:57.219
<i>from the Lydell Lipps case.</i>

25:57.252 --> 25:58.947
<i>What does it say
that he's not here with you?</i>

25:58.980 --> 26:00.804
<i>Charlie Waldo
is busy uncovering...</i>

26:09.284 --> 26:12.900
Welcome to kindergartens
of the rich and famous.

26:12.931 --> 26:15.107
Gaby, Mr. Lion needs to
talk to your teacher.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.700
But first, he's going to
park this beast.

26:17.731 --> 26:19.940
Now get out, little blighter.

26:22.820 --> 26:24.068
Baby back ribs in there.

26:27.395 --> 26:29.540
Alas, poor Yorick!

26:29.572 --> 26:31.524
I knew him, my sweet Gaby,

26:31.556 --> 26:35.171
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

26:35.204 --> 26:37.795
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,

26:37.828 --> 26:40.132
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!

26:40.164 --> 26:41.891
My gorge rises at it.

26:41.924 --> 26:44.740
Yes, you're a shadow
of your former self.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.212
It's that keto diet I'm on.

26:46.244 --> 26:48.996
I'm starving. I think I may have
taken it a bit too far.

26:49.028 --> 26:50.340
You got anything in your lunch?

26:50.371 --> 26:52.547
Like a pork chop?
Ham sandwich? No?

26:52.580 --> 26:53.700
I'm afraid it
wouldn't do you any good,

26:53.732 --> 26:55.524
dear boy.
I think you're dead.

26:55.556 --> 26:57.251
Dead? That's tragic.

26:57.284 --> 27:00.387
Yes, indeed, it's tragic.

27:00.420 --> 27:02.211
Where be your gibes now?

27:02.244 --> 27:04.771
Your gambols? Your songs?

27:04.804 --> 27:06.084
Your flashes of merriment

27:06.116 --> 27:09.092
that were wont to set the table
on a roar?

27:10.820 --> 27:12.484
I think
I've soiled my britches.

27:12.515 --> 27:15.395
Should I change my nappy?
Oh, it's all squishy.

27:15.428 --> 27:17.315
Bravo!

27:17.348 --> 27:18.627
Oh, yes, thank you, thank you.

27:18.660 --> 27:20.291
That was funny, Daddy.

27:20.324 --> 27:23.460
Yes. That speech
always slays them.

27:23.492 --> 27:25.539
Come. Let's play on the swings.

27:25.573 --> 27:27.971
I believe Mr. Lion
wants to ask Miss White

27:28.004 --> 27:30.212
whether Daddy plays nicely with
the other children.

27:30.243 --> 27:31.907
Off we go.
Let's get to the swings.

27:31.940 --> 27:34.820
- It'll be a swinging time.
- Swing, swing, swing!

27:34.851 --> 27:37.348
My name's Waldo.

27:37.379 --> 27:39.331
I'm a detective
working for Alastair.

27:39.364 --> 27:42.436
Jayne.
My heart breaks for Gaby.

27:42.467 --> 27:46.244
Mr. Pinch is doing a lot
to keep her spirits up.

27:46.276 --> 27:49.251
And Mrs. Pinch...
What was she like as a parent?

27:51.811 --> 27:54.243
Mrs. Pinch?

27:56.740 --> 27:59.108
We have the children memorize
these poems.

27:59.140 --> 28:03.299
I like to ask the kids whose mom
and dad can recite them too.

28:03.331 --> 28:04.707
Half the time
these parents can't,

28:04.740 --> 28:08.612
but the nanny can
in two languages.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.660
What about the Pinches?

28:10.693 --> 28:12.291
Mrs. Pinch never knew them.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.971
Mr. Pinch, always.

28:16.004 --> 28:18.659
That's unusual.

28:18.691 --> 28:20.931
The death must have shocked
the hell out of this place, huh?

28:22.724 --> 28:24.419
Not me.

28:27.428 --> 28:28.707
Good morning, kids.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.204
Okay, everyone find their place.
Get your bunnies.

28:31.235 --> 28:32.995
We're gonna start by writing
your names on the back of them,

28:33.028 --> 28:35.011
so have a marker.

28:35.044 --> 28:38.403
Miss White, I'm gonna need
to talk to you again.

28:38.437 --> 28:39.875
Sure.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.708
Does everyone have their bunny
from yesterday?

28:48.164 --> 28:50.852
Come meet me tonight.
We can talk then.

28:52.868 --> 28:55.204
All right.
Have you got names set?

28:55.235 --> 28:56.740
Yes, Miss White.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.067
Do you put your boots
on your chairs at home?

29:56.100 --> 29:58.403
I live in a trailer
with a chicken.

29:59.811 --> 30:02.724
What happened to this "vayse"?

30:02.756 --> 30:05.540
"Vahse."

30:05.571 --> 30:09.124
Ah, yes. Well...

30:09.155 --> 30:11.331
That's the one
she was killed with.

30:13.284 --> 30:14.819
What was that, ceramic?

30:14.851 --> 30:17.124
Earthenware.
Nice vase. I rather miss it.

30:17.156 --> 30:18.915
What about that table?

30:20.675 --> 30:21.956
It's different.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.907
Monica was a tinkerer.

30:23.941 --> 30:27.620
No room was ever finished
to her satisfaction.

30:27.651 --> 30:31.491
Mm. And that sculpture.

30:31.524 --> 30:33.059
The Bard?

30:33.091 --> 30:34.693
The sculpture.

30:34.724 --> 30:36.517
This.

30:38.084 --> 30:39.971
Ah, dear boy.

30:40.004 --> 30:44.101
That's a Regis Award
for my Richard III.

30:44.132 --> 30:45.604
Did you move it?

30:45.635 --> 30:48.836
I've never been much
for acting trophies.

30:48.868 --> 30:51.748
Monica had that one on display
for sentimental reasons.

30:51.781 --> 30:53.475
That was the production
on which we met.

30:53.507 --> 30:55.075
Really?

30:55.108 --> 30:57.955
Perhaps it's wherever Monica
put my other Regises

30:57.988 --> 31:02.276
or my... People's Choice Award.

31:03.811 --> 31:05.635
Good night, sweet prince.

31:05.668 --> 31:08.132
Flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

31:17.348 --> 31:21.059
♪ In the old rugged cross ♪

31:21.091 --> 31:24.613

31:42.500 --> 31:46.051
There goes the good girl
kindergarten teacher.

31:46.083 --> 31:50.115
Just wait till I have
a few Maker's in me.

31:50.147 --> 31:53.156
So why weren't you shocked
that Monica Pinch was killed?

31:59.876 --> 32:04.228
Okay, Mr. Waldo.

32:04.259 --> 32:06.275
I have a confession.

32:06.308 --> 32:09.219
Okay.

32:09.251 --> 32:11.108
I've been watching
all this TV coverage

32:11.139 --> 32:12.356
since the murder.

32:15.492 --> 32:16.995
I knew exactly who you were

32:17.027 --> 32:19.011
the minute you walked into
my classroom.

32:19.045 --> 32:21.443
That figures.

32:26.371 --> 32:28.291
Who was Lydell Lipps?

32:28.323 --> 32:31.652
Everyone keeps talking
about Lydell Lipps.

32:38.212 --> 32:40.357
I can usually tell when
someone's messing with me.

32:40.388 --> 32:43.045
You're jamming up my radar.

32:43.076 --> 32:45.603
Maybe your radar's just rusty.

32:48.068 --> 32:49.765
Yeah, maybe.

32:50.084 --> 32:52.228
Here you go.

32:52.259 --> 32:53.892
Thanks.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.260
To whiskey and good hair.

33:13.028 --> 33:14.660
It's been a while.

33:24.227 --> 33:26.147
Okay. If you want to know,
I'll tell you.

33:32.196 --> 33:36.483
11 years ago,
there was a robbery at 7-11.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.908
The girl behind the counter
and two customers

33:39.940 --> 33:41.251
got shot dead.

33:41.283 --> 33:45.059
I turned up a kid
named Donny Lipps.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.372
Leaned on him pretty hard.

33:46.405 --> 33:47.875
It paid off.

33:47.907 --> 33:50.115
He said he was waiting
in the car outside.

33:50.148 --> 33:52.068
And in return for a deal,

33:52.100 --> 33:54.372
he would give me the shooter.

33:54.404 --> 33:57.988
Turns out that was Lydell,
his brother.

33:58.021 --> 34:00.805
Signed, sealed.

34:00.836 --> 34:02.499
My career's off to the races,
right,

34:02.531 --> 34:05.315
and I am on fire with ambition.

34:05.348 --> 34:07.492
Everything's going great.

34:07.525 --> 34:09.732
Cut to years later.

34:09.764 --> 34:11.556
Lydell comes up for parole,

34:11.588 --> 34:14.467
and the prosecutors ask me to
help them prep for the hearing.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.165
So I go see the brother again,

34:16.196 --> 34:17.859
who's in prison himself
at this point.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.748
Three strikes, unrelated.

34:21.635 --> 34:27.556
Only now he tells me that
the original story was bullshit.

34:27.588 --> 34:31.299
He made it up
to get me off his back.

34:35.204 --> 34:36.612
So at that point,

34:36.643 --> 34:38.341
Lydell had been in jail for...

34:38.371 --> 34:42.020
7 years, 3 months, and 16 days.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.594
Well, next thing I learn,

34:46.628 --> 34:49.891
it is a lot harder to get
an innocent man out of jail

34:49.924 --> 34:52.451
than to put a guilty man in.

34:52.484 --> 34:54.851
System isn't designed
to deal with mistakes.

34:54.884 --> 34:58.019
And some individuals aren't,
either.

34:59.907 --> 35:01.540
But I keep pushing.

35:01.572 --> 35:03.044
And I keep pushing

35:03.076 --> 35:04.356
and I keep pushing,

35:04.388 --> 35:08.036
and I'm doing everything I can.

35:08.068 --> 35:09.956
And this goes on for a year.

35:13.508 --> 35:16.900
And then Lydell got stabbed

35:16.932 --> 35:20.420
in a yard fight
and he bled to death.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.692
After spending every day
of his adult life

35:22.724 --> 35:25.412
locked up for something
that he didn't fucking do.

35:25.444 --> 35:28.228
And that I

35:28.260 --> 35:30.627
built a career on.

35:37.732 --> 35:40.580
And when I run out of people
that would listen,

35:40.612 --> 35:42.340
which took about six months...

35:45.220 --> 35:47.556
Um...

35:47.588 --> 35:49.380
I quit.

35:49.412 --> 35:52.132
And I started talking
to anyone with a microphone.

35:54.116 --> 35:56.900
I guess that would have
burned a lot of bridges.

35:56.932 --> 35:58.820
Oh, I burned the fucking river.

36:06.179 --> 36:08.131
You still haven't told me.

36:08.163 --> 36:10.532
What?

36:10.564 --> 36:13.444
Why weren't you shocked
about Monica Pinch?

36:13.476 --> 36:16.004
Oh, of course I was shocked.

36:16.036 --> 36:19.683
I mean, how could I
not be shocked?

36:19.715 --> 36:21.732
I don't follow.

36:21.764 --> 36:25.988
Waldo,

36:26.020 --> 36:28.740
can't you tell when a girl just
wants to have a drink with you?

36:49.092 --> 36:51.235
I said a drink.

36:55.844 --> 36:58.404
Three years in the woods.

36:58.436 --> 37:00.899
You haven't been
with anybody all that time?

37:03.492 --> 37:05.124
No.

37:08.676 --> 37:11.972
That's kind of hot, Waldo.

37:29.731 --> 37:30.691
- Alastair.
- Ah.

37:30.724 --> 37:31.684
They're gonna arrest you.

37:31.716 --> 37:32.740
Those are news helicopters.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.788
LAPD's putting on a show.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.772
- Go put some clothes on.
- Don't be silly, love.

37:36.804 --> 37:40.452
The network will adore me
in this wardrobe.

37:40.484 --> 37:43.075
Anyway, if it's good enough
for Wacko Jacko,

37:43.107 --> 37:44.388
it's good enough for me.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.636
Beautiful.

37:45.668 --> 37:47.268
Tits and teeth.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.867
Fuck.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.436
- Hold your fire.
- Morning.

37:50.468 --> 37:51.492
Alastair Pinch,
you're under arrest

37:51.524 --> 37:53.028
for the murder of Monica Pinch.

37:53.060 --> 37:55.204
Come on, Pete.
Do we have to do it like this?

37:55.236 --> 37:56.932
Let him come in
and surrender himself.

37:56.964 --> 37:59.012
- Hands behind your back.
- Really? You're gonna cuff him?

37:59.044 --> 38:00.580
You can't do me a solid
for old times?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.020
Fuck you, old times.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.452
You made 10,000 good cops
look like the fucking Klan.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.436
Say goodbye to
your pretty house, huh, Olivier?

38:06.468 --> 38:07.588
Last time you're gonna see it.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.380
Daddy?

38:09.412 --> 38:11.588
Daddy's just going for
a sleepover.

38:11.619 --> 38:12.996
Be a good girl.
See you tomorrow.

38:13.028 --> 38:14.052
Come on. Let's go.

38:33.091 --> 38:35.907
Hey!

38:35.940 --> 38:40.132
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.404
Did he get bail?

38:50.436 --> 38:52.708
$20 million.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.756
Don't be silly.
We're paying the bail.

38:54.788 --> 38:56.100
It's only $20 million.
I'm insured for it.

38:56.131 --> 38:57.252
- I got to talk to you.
- Hold on.

38:57.284 --> 38:58.500
- I g...
- And that's the end of it.

38:58.532 --> 39:01.156
- So yeah.
- I spoke to my guy at LAPD.

39:01.187 --> 39:03.300
He's why they turned it
into a festival.

39:03.332 --> 39:05.188
You have to get rid of him.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.852
Look, I'm happy to quit.

39:06.884 --> 39:08.772
I don't want to make
this worse for anybody.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.692
Worse? You're making it better.

39:10.724 --> 39:12.068
Listen, does one of you guys
have the time?

39:12.099 --> 39:13.892
Apparently I have Charlie Sheen
in my office.

39:13.924 --> 39:15.748
How is he making it better?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.412
The bigger assholes
the cops are,

39:17.444 --> 39:19.364
the more sympathy
for our protagonist.

39:19.396 --> 39:21.444
Cheer up, Waldo.
You can't win them all.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.332
Yeah. Yeah. Be right there.

39:24.388 --> 39:26.020
Asshole.

39:47.971 --> 39:50.308
Jesus, Waldo.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.972
Oh, boy.

39:52.004 --> 39:53.379
You don't know me anymore,
you understand?

39:53.412 --> 39:55.812
- You're poison.
- Good to see you too, Freddie.

39:55.844 --> 39:57.508
You been to division yet?

39:57.540 --> 39:59.491
Unh-unh. Probably 20 guys
in that building

39:59.524 --> 40:00.804
like to knock my teeth out.

40:00.836 --> 40:02.660
Twenty?
A hundred!

40:02.692 --> 40:05.796
Twenty would like to
shoot them out with a bullet.

40:07.268 --> 40:09.444
I want the autopsy protocol
on Monica Pinch.

40:09.476 --> 40:11.236
All the slides, all the photos.

40:11.267 --> 40:14.147
Yeah, good luck with that.

40:14.180 --> 40:16.036
They indict, defense has
the right to everything.

40:16.067 --> 40:18.724
So you can deal with me

40:18.756 --> 40:20.196
or you can deal with
Fontella Davis,

40:20.228 --> 40:22.564
who's every bit the delight
she seems on TV

40:22.596 --> 40:24.996
and who, by the way,
never got you Laker tickets

40:25.028 --> 40:27.491
or lied to your wife
to cover for you.

40:29.859 --> 40:32.164
Charlie fucking Waldo.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.180
Jesus.

40:39.140 --> 40:41.700
Straight up, Freddy...
how'd you make this?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.780
Cerebral hemorrhage.
Severe blow in the right temple,

40:43.811 --> 40:44.900
second contusion
back of the head,

40:44.932 --> 40:46.500
probably from where she fell.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.068
Victim was found locked
in a house with a drunk

40:48.099 --> 40:49.571
with two assault convictions
in England.

40:49.604 --> 40:52.356
So I'm guessing suicide.

40:52.388 --> 40:54.115
And the alarm,
you know about that, right?

40:54.148 --> 40:55.748
Turns out the alarm company
has it being on

40:55.779 --> 40:57.380
since the previous night.

40:57.412 --> 40:59.044
Before or after time of death?

40:59.076 --> 41:00.388
Too close to call.

41:00.420 --> 41:03.844
Guy clobbered his wife
to death with a vase.

41:03.876 --> 41:05.316
That simple.

41:16.356 --> 41:17.540
Hello?

41:17.572 --> 41:19.588
I know who killed
Monica Pinch.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.011
Who is this?

41:23.044 --> 41:25.284
Meet me at that rock pile
you live at, Waldo.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.788
I'm not there. I'm in L.A.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.675
Your piece-of-shit trailer. Now.

41:28.708 --> 41:30.947
Nini, is that a croissant?
Give me one of those.

42:03.587 --> 42:06.692
Nini, check underneath there.

42:06.723 --> 42:08.739
Nothing? Anything?

42:08.772 --> 42:12.900
Open this shit up.

42:12.931 --> 42:15.428
This a Kindle?

42:15.459 --> 42:17.635
How you like it so far?

42:17.668 --> 42:21.508
I'm trying to decide
between this and the Nook.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.756
Nook's a little cheaper.

42:22.787 --> 42:25.028
I like the Kindle
for content.

42:25.059 --> 42:27.235
Content. Right.
How's their tech support?

42:27.268 --> 42:28.932
Keep looking.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.308
Pretty good.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.195
Out of 10,
what would you give it?

42:32.228 --> 42:34.436
- 8.
- 8. Fucking...

42:46.691 --> 42:47.907
I'm Don Q.

42:47.940 --> 42:51.556
You heard of me?

42:51.587 --> 42:53.476
This man is Nini.

42:53.507 --> 42:55.716
Do not fuck with this man.

42:55.748 --> 42:58.307
He was number-one ranked
Inuit light heavyweight.

42:58.340 --> 43:00.548
Nini, squeeze me.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.116
- Inuit?
- Yeah.

43:02.147 --> 43:04.227
Is that like Eskimo?

43:04.260 --> 43:09.700
No. No, see,

43:09.731 --> 43:12.740
Nini, here,
he's from Canada.

43:12.771 --> 43:14.468
You can say Eskimo in Alaska,

43:14.500 --> 43:17.155
but in Canada,
they prefer to be called Inuit.

43:17.188 --> 43:19.204
To them, Eskimo is
considered pejorative.

43:19.235 --> 43:21.476
You need to be careful
with chicken.

43:27.363 --> 43:29.828
- There he goes.
- Oh, wow.

43:31.715 --> 43:32.836
That was fucking good.

43:32.867 --> 43:34.052
Yeah, of course.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.419
That ain't the reason
for our visit.

43:36.451 --> 43:37.636
Where is it?

43:37.667 --> 43:39.364
Where is what?

43:39.908 --> 43:42.692
The mem that Lorena
left with you.

43:45.316 --> 43:48.196
Where is it, Waldo? Huh?

43:48.227 --> 43:50.180
I'm starting to think
you're not here

43:50.211 --> 43:52.227
to tell me who killed
Monica Pinch.

43:52.260 --> 43:54.820
So you are a detective.

43:54.851 --> 43:56.836
Where are all your possessions?

43:58.724 --> 44:00.580
I'm a minimalist.

44:00.611 --> 44:01.956
What's that,
like the... the artists

44:01.987 --> 44:04.676
with the white on white
and shit?

44:04.707 --> 44:08.516
It's more like a lifestyle.

44:08.547 --> 44:10.563
I only have 100 things.

44:13.955 --> 44:15.811
100 things.

44:15.844 --> 44:19.333
Well, 99 now.

44:19.364 --> 44:22.116
That's fucked up, bro, though.

44:22.148 --> 44:25.667
Especially if one of them
is mine.

44:25.700 --> 44:30.211
You got 24 hours,
and then I want my mem.

44:30.244 --> 44:31.556
What's a mem?

44:31.587 --> 44:34.115
Call my boy here
when you got it in hand.

44:34.148 --> 44:37.573
818-OH-NANOOK.

44:37.604 --> 44:40.131
The alternative...

44:41.924 --> 44:43.875
Maybe you end up like Lorena.

44:46.884 --> 44:47.972
Where is she?

44:48.003 --> 44:49.411
Nini, let's go.

44:49.444 --> 44:52.291
Hey, fuckface!

44:52.324 --> 44:54.179
I don't think
I look like a fuckface.

44:54.211 --> 44:56.035
If anything,
he looks like a fuckface.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.572
I mean, what does
a fuckface look like?

44:57.603 --> 44:58.563
I don't know.

45:38.756 --> 45:40.355
This doesn't make sense.

45:46.628 --> 45:48.131
Back to 100.

46:01.571 --> 46:04.676
Yeah. That's right.

46:12.995 --> 46:15.171
Charlie Waldo.
This is what I want.

46:15.204 --> 46:17.891
One, everyone who was on
crime scene security.

46:17.924 --> 46:20.675
Two, all transport, medical,
and emergency personnel

46:20.708 --> 46:22.851
who had contact
with the victim and the suspect.

46:22.884 --> 46:24.579
Don't talk to him.
Nobody gives him anything.

46:24.611 --> 46:26.435
He's a rat.
Nothing to see here.

46:26.468 --> 46:27.844
Show's over.
Let's go back to work.

46:27.877 --> 46:29.475
All right.
How about first to respond?

46:29.507 --> 46:31.813
I'll start there.

46:31.844 --> 46:33.347
- Huh?
- Don't talk to him.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.300
Nobody talks to him.
He's not here, all right?

46:35.331 --> 46:37.795
You ignored him, understand?
Understood?

46:37.828 --> 46:39.140
You do what I say, not him.

46:39.171 --> 46:41.317
You.

46:41.348 --> 46:43.011
Officer...

46:43.044 --> 46:45.220
Anus?

46:45.253 --> 46:46.628
Annis.

46:46.659 --> 46:47.844
High school must have sucked.

46:47.876 --> 46:49.444
Do not speak to him, Annis.

46:49.475 --> 46:51.395
You were at the Pinch house?
You the first ones,

46:51.428 --> 46:52.900
- you and your partner?
- Annis...

46:52.933 --> 46:55.299
Do you know who
Fontella Davis is?

46:55.331 --> 46:56.740
- Ignore him.
- Do you want her

46:56.773 --> 46:58.051
on TV every night
making this case about you?

46:58.084 --> 47:00.004
- Show's over.
- When you arrived

47:00.035 --> 47:02.276
at the house,
was the door dead-bolted?

47:02.308 --> 47:04.100
You sure? It's frosted glass.

47:04.131 --> 47:06.308
You couldn't see him unlock it.
You heard it that clearly?

47:06.340 --> 47:07.651
The alarm was on.
We saw him disarm it.

47:07.684 --> 47:09.220
- What did I say?
- Yes, Anus,

47:09.253 --> 47:11.972
but the real killer could have
set the alarm on the way out

47:12.004 --> 47:13.700
- if the door wasn't dead-bolted.
- He's just talking in circles.

47:13.731 --> 47:14.884
What about
the murder weapon?

47:14.917 --> 47:15.973
It's all bullshit.

47:16.004 --> 47:17.668
The earthenware vase.

47:17.701 --> 47:19.395
It wasn't you that gathered up
all the pieces, was it?

47:19.427 --> 47:22.179
Do not fucking answer him,
all right?

47:22.211 --> 47:23.971
Yes, Waldo, he got all
the pieces of the murder weapon.

47:24.004 --> 47:25.540
- I supervised it myself.
- The earthenware vase.

47:25.573 --> 47:27.044
The earthenware vase.

47:27.075 --> 47:29.348
Only the earthenware vase
isn't the murder weapon.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.748
Not if Alastair Pinch
killed her.

47:31.779 --> 47:33.188
That thing's got to weigh
28 pounds.

47:33.220 --> 47:35.715
It came down
over the victim's right eye.

47:35.747 --> 47:37.731
You'd have to be pretty strong a
lefty to make a shot like that,

47:37.764 --> 47:39.235
not a drunken righty.

47:39.268 --> 47:40.515
Almost convincing.

47:40.547 --> 47:42.148
Pinch is a righty.
I've watched him pour.

47:42.179 --> 47:44.355
Officer Annis,
could I have a moment?

47:46.148 --> 47:48.131
You see that statue?

47:48.164 --> 47:49.859
That's a Regis Award
for acting in England.

47:49.891 --> 47:52.196
You ever seen it before?

47:52.228 --> 47:54.181
That's 'cause it's missing.
That's the murder weapon.

47:54.212 --> 47:56.132
- Oh, please. Time to go home.
- Three and a half pounds.

47:56.164 --> 47:58.563
The earthenware vase, the victim
hit that on the way down.

47:58.595 --> 48:00.388
- Annis.
- Hey, don't look at him.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.371
The department's gonna
let you get fucked on this.

48:02.403 --> 48:03.748
- Believe me, I know.
- That's it, Waldo.

48:03.781 --> 48:04.837
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds,
how about that?

48:04.868 --> 48:06.179
- 10 seconds?
- Yeah.

48:06.211 --> 48:07.491
- Perfect. That's all I need.
- 9.

48:07.525 --> 48:08.995
Annis, you don't want
to be the guy

48:09.028 --> 48:10.179
who puts away an innocent man,
believe me.

48:10.211 --> 48:11.875
- Let's... Come on.
- You may as well

48:11.908 --> 48:13.059
pull down your pants,
'cause you're gonna get fucked.

48:13.091 --> 48:14.468
- Come on.
- You're gonna get fucked, Annis.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.675
It sounded like he fumbled
with the dead-bolt...

48:16.708 --> 48:18.181
- What did I tell you?!
- He was still drunk.

48:18.212 --> 48:19.588
We couldn't tell for sure.

48:19.619 --> 48:21.731
Shut the fuck up, Anus.

48:21.764 --> 48:23.780
Nobody talks to this scum sack.

48:23.812 --> 48:25.861
This man is not a cop.
He is not one of us.

48:25.892 --> 48:27.491
He's a fucking rat.

48:27.524 --> 48:30.757
He's a person of interest
in a homicide investigation.

48:30.788 --> 48:33.188
For those of you
that don't know,

48:33.219 --> 48:37.923
the body of one adult female

48:37.955 --> 48:41.348
ID'd as Lorena Nascimento.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.972
Yeah, she borrowed
her husband's Porsche.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.988
She didn't tell you about him,
did she?

48:46.021 --> 48:47.684
We found it on fire
off the freeway,

48:47.715 --> 48:49.667
up by Magic Mountain.

48:49.699 --> 48:53.348
Fully engulfed, body inside.

48:53.379 --> 48:55.299
That item she gave you,

48:55.331 --> 48:57.188
that could put Don Q away
for so long

48:57.219 --> 49:00.292
you'll both die
of natural causes.

49:00.325 --> 49:03.428
Why don't you just
give it to me?

49:04.452 --> 49:06.085
I tried to warn you.

49:23.075 --> 49:24.388
What the fuck?

49:34.948 --> 49:36.036
Fuck you!

49:36.068 --> 49:37.411
Fuck you!

49:37.443 --> 49:38.852
Fuck you!

49:49.028 --> 49:50.755
Killed her!

49:52.196 --> 49:55.045
They fucking killed her!

50:17.444 --> 50:18.948
I, uh...

50:18.980 --> 50:21.028
I had my bike on this rack.

50:21.061 --> 50:23.395
I think I left my lock.

50:23.427 --> 50:25.539
Following me all day.

50:25.571 --> 50:27.363
Who the fuck are you?

50:27.395 --> 50:31.331
An attorney. I'm an attorney
specializing in personal injury.

50:31.364 --> 50:33.155
And if you do not unhand me,

50:33.188 --> 50:34.947
I will sue damages.

50:34.979 --> 50:37.028
Please?

50:37.059 --> 50:40.036
That's fine.

50:40.068 --> 50:43.940
That's fine.

50:43.972 --> 50:45.603
You're a private eye?

50:45.635 --> 50:47.972
Yeah. I'm a private eye.

50:48.004 --> 50:49.700
Who the fuck are you?

50:49.732 --> 50:52.195
You, sir,
just committed a felony,

50:52.227 --> 50:54.115
presenting yourself as a PI
in the state of California

50:54.147 --> 50:56.995
when you are, in fact,
unlicensed.

50:57.027 --> 50:58.308
Now, I will level with you.

50:58.340 --> 51:01.572
I have a client
who cannot understand

51:01.604 --> 51:04.388
why you would associate yourself
with a murderer

51:04.420 --> 51:06.148
like Alastair Pinch.

51:15.363 --> 51:17.219
Beautiful watch.

51:24.388 --> 51:26.276
Who's the client?

51:26.308 --> 51:27.715
Listen.

51:27.747 --> 51:29.060
Asshole.

51:29.092 --> 51:32.547
I'm not gonna let you
wrestle me off this case.

51:32.579 --> 51:34.852
- No, no, Mr. Waldo.
- Let's just communicate.

51:34.885 --> 51:37.604
There has been no threat
from me, nor do I intend one.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.355
- I apologize.
- I am going to fucking kill you.

51:40.388 --> 51:43.075
No, sir, listen.
It is my hope and my client's

51:43.107 --> 51:46.532
that this pleasant, okay,
happenstantial meeting

51:46.564 --> 51:48.035
between the last two of us

51:48.068 --> 51:49.252
is the last time you and I
see each other.

51:49.285 --> 51:52.835
So with that in mind, excuse me.

51:52.868 --> 51:55.076
Sir, please.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.980
I'll take my things.

52:00.836 --> 52:04.452
You know, actually,
on second thought,

52:04.484 --> 52:09.284
neither one of these
are my bike.

52:09.316 --> 52:10.468
Good day.

52:21.700 --> 52:25.475
Yeah, thanks for the phone,
you fucking ambulance chaser.

52:29.732 --> 52:34.979
Warren Gomes, Esquire.

52:35.011 --> 52:36.835
Warren Gomes.

52:36.867 --> 52:39.076
The last call was to...

52:39.108 --> 52:40.803
Darius Jamshidi.

52:40.836 --> 52:43.332
Darius Jamshidi.

52:43.364 --> 52:45.924
Darius Jamshidi.

52:48.836 --> 52:51.331
Huh.

52:51.363 --> 52:55.780
Where do we live,
Darius Jamshidi?

53:05.220 --> 53:06.852
Jamshidi.

53:06.884 --> 53:08.772
You're not gonna wrestle me
off this case.

53:08.804 --> 53:10.531
Asshole.

53:10.564 --> 53:12.484
Fuck this.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.988
You ghosted me, Waldo.

54:49.059 --> 54:52.676
I'm looking for Darius Jamshidi!

55:01.187 --> 55:03.972
Come on. Who's gonna help me?

55:04.004 --> 55:06.852
You gonna help me?

55:06.884 --> 55:12.484
I spy with my little eye

55:12.516 --> 55:13.604
Darius Jamshidi.

55:16.452 --> 55:17.796
No?

55:17.828 --> 55:19.108
You look like a Darius.

55:19.140 --> 55:20.324
All right.
That's enough.

55:20.356 --> 55:21.347
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.396
Oh, yeah? Really?

55:25.060 --> 55:26.980
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look at me.

55:27.012 --> 55:28.260
He attacked me.

55:28.292 --> 55:29.764
- I'm just...
- That's enough, friend.

55:29.796 --> 55:31.748
Okay, fellas,
it's two against one.

55:31.780 --> 55:35.460
Come on. Where's your sense
of sportsmanship?

55:36.932 --> 55:38.724
Stop!

55:38.756 --> 55:41.796
Be cool.

55:41.828 --> 55:44.260
He needs to take those handcuffs
off his belt

55:44.292 --> 55:48.260
and handcuff one of his wrists,
okay?

55:48.292 --> 55:50.884
- Tell him.
- Do it.

55:53.956 --> 55:55.172
Knee.

55:55.203 --> 55:58.212
Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Steady.

55:58.244 --> 56:01.796
Now, I have an idea, and I don't
want you to panic, okay?

56:01.828 --> 56:03.428
Just go with me.

56:06.788 --> 56:09.060
Okay.

56:09.091 --> 56:11.332
Whew.
All right.

56:11.364 --> 56:13.124
Now...

56:13.828 --> 56:16.036
...we're gonna take
a little walk.

56:16.067 --> 56:20.804
And you're gonna introduce me
to Mr. Jamshidi.

56:22.724 --> 56:25.540
All right. Let's go.
We're walking.

56:25.571 --> 56:28.228
How about him?

56:28.260 --> 56:29.892
Hm?

56:29.924 --> 56:31.683
Okay, him?

56:31.716 --> 56:32.739
Okay.

56:32.772 --> 56:35.396
How about him, huh?

56:35.428 --> 56:38.084
I'm Darius Jamshidi.

56:38.116 --> 56:41.283
The real police will be here
in a few minutes,

56:41.316 --> 56:44.964
but I'd be happy to
speak with you until then.

56:59.140 --> 57:02.340
I see you're trying to
buy a television network, huh?

57:06.020 --> 57:09.827
This ends with you walking out
that door in a few minutes.

57:09.860 --> 57:12.420
You sic Warren Gomes on me?

57:12.451 --> 57:14.404
I assume you sent those kids,
too.

57:14.436 --> 57:16.516
The Palisades Posse.

57:16.547 --> 57:18.276
Question is,

57:18.308 --> 57:21.251
why do you want me to stay away
from the Pinch case?

57:24.164 --> 57:26.180
- I don't know who you are.
- Have you met my wife?

57:26.212 --> 57:28.323
But you just ruined my benefit.

57:28.356 --> 57:31.107
And no doubt cost a very,
very important charity

57:31.140 --> 57:33.027
tens of thousands of dollars.

57:33.060 --> 57:34.884
Now, I want you to go release
those two men,

57:34.916 --> 57:36.867
and I want you to unlock
that one man's ear

57:36.900 --> 57:38.371
from the other man's backside.

57:38.404 --> 57:39.716
I'll do that.

57:39.747 --> 57:41.251
My husband will show you
to the tennis courts.

57:41.284 --> 57:44.452
You'll find those men there
and your chain.

57:44.484 --> 57:47.076
- Thank you.
- Asshole.

57:47.108 --> 57:48.900
She seems very nice.

57:48.931 --> 57:51.204
This has been delightful.

57:51.236 --> 57:54.628
The wall past the next house
backs out onto Mulholland.

57:54.660 --> 57:55.972
If you'd be so kind

57:56.004 --> 57:58.947
as to not cause any more drama
in the party.

57:58.980 --> 58:01.475
Tell me who Warren Gomes is.

58:01.508 --> 58:03.972
Gomes is dead.

58:04.004 --> 58:05.540
What are you talking about?

58:05.572 --> 58:07.300
I just spoke with the police.

58:07.331 --> 58:10.404
Someone shot him
just before you arrived.

58:10.436 --> 58:14.051
It wasn't you, per chance,
was it?

58:14.084 --> 58:17.348
Why don't you tell me
what he was doing for you?

58:17.379 --> 58:24.484
Warren Gomes has... had
a talent for special research,

58:24.515 --> 58:27.812
which allows my company
to make what it makes.

58:27.843 --> 58:29.380
Which is?

58:29.411 --> 58:31.460
Money.

58:31.492 --> 58:35.427
So Gomes was digging up dirt
to help you buy the network.

58:35.460 --> 58:38.084
Why do you want me to stay away
from Pinch?

58:42.052 --> 58:43.620
I believe that's for you.

59:06.243 --> 59:07.299
Waldo.

59:09.060 --> 59:10.628
Waldo.

59:29.156 --> 59:30.851
Alastair?

59:33.827 --> 59:35.524
Rosario?

59:38.339 --> 59:40.195
Alastair?

01:00:45.157 --> 01:00:47.620
Where's Alastair?

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:56.387
Line.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.019
"I'll recuse myself
if I have to."

01:00:58.051 --> 01:00:59.235
- Shit.
- And cut.

01:00:59.267 --> 01:01:00.517
Excuse me.

01:01:00.548 --> 01:01:02.980
I must have been distracted
by your perfume.

01:01:04.964 --> 01:01:06.659
Things are getting
fucking strange,

01:01:06.691 --> 01:01:08.293
and I need your help.

01:01:08.324 --> 01:01:10.851
Darius Jamshidi.

01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:12.867
That name mean
anything to you?

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.515
No, but Robert Blake
called last night

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:20.164
and asked if I want
to play pinochle on Thursdays.

01:01:20.195 --> 01:01:23.108
You do realize that everyone
is sure you did this.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.420
The only thing giving me doubts

01:01:24.452 --> 01:01:26.211
it's that someone's
busting my horns.

01:01:26.244 --> 01:01:28.035
and me figuring out why

01:01:28.067 --> 01:01:29.860
is the only thing
standing between you

01:01:29.891 --> 01:01:31.044
and a life sentence.

01:01:31.076 --> 01:01:33.668
When I ask for help,
I don't know,

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.715
maybe you should fucking help.

01:01:35.747 --> 01:01:38.595
Simmer down.
How could I be of service?

01:01:41.348 --> 01:01:44.228
Is there anything
you're not telling me?

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.668
Like what?

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.195
Like did you invite someone over
to your house that night?

01:01:48.227 --> 01:01:49.347
- No.
- You sure?

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.075
- Absolutely.
- Could you invite someone

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.804
over to the house
and not remember the next day?

01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:54.724
I've gotten married,
fathered children,

01:01:54.755 --> 01:01:58.499
and taken out mortgages
and not remembered the next day.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:05.444
When did you move
the furniture around?

01:02:05.475 --> 01:02:06.820
I told you, Monica was
a constant tinkerer.

01:02:06.853 --> 01:02:08.291
She was never finished...

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:10.211
The night table
in my room doesn't fit.

01:02:10.244 --> 01:02:12.131
I'm thinking someone moved it
from your room

01:02:12.164 --> 01:02:13.795
and the one in your room
from the living room,

01:02:13.828 --> 01:02:15.748
probably on the night
of the murder

01:02:15.779 --> 01:02:17.924
unless you moved it since.

01:02:17.955 --> 01:02:20.739
I have not moved them since.
Piss off.

01:02:31.524 --> 01:02:35.524
What shall you do, Detective,

01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:39.460
if find that I did,
in fact, murder my wife?

01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:41.060
Will you stand for your client

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.595
or... or for truth and justice,

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:45.604
like the incorruptible
Charlie Waldo of yore?

01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:54.339
You stick with truth
and justice, Waldo.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:57.315
If I've killed
my little girl's mother,

01:02:57.347 --> 01:03:00.644
I'll take what's coming to me
and call it even.

01:03:04.357 --> 01:03:05.699
Daddy!

01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:08.835
Ah! There's my darling.

01:03:08.867 --> 01:03:10.659
I know all of my lines
for the play.

01:03:10.691 --> 01:03:13.475
I can't wait to see
your Rumpelstiltskin.

01:03:13.508 --> 01:03:14.724
Come, now.

01:03:14.755 --> 01:03:17.284
Today I brew, tomorrow I bake.

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:20.355
And then the prince child
I'll take!

01:03:26.372 --> 01:03:27.460
You sound like a maniac.

01:03:27.493 --> 01:03:29.891
Hey, you sober enough to drive?

01:03:29.924 --> 01:03:31.684
I suppose so. Why?

01:03:31.715 --> 01:03:33.157
I'll meet you at your house.

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:34.916
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:03:34.948 --> 01:03:37.092
Just lock the door
and don't answer it.

01:03:39.459 --> 01:03:41.701
Hey! Fuckhead!

01:03:41.732 --> 01:03:43.588
Tell me about Lorena.

01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:45.572
Fuck you.

01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:47.043
How about you tell me
about my mem?

01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:49.187
I don't even know
what a fucking mem is!

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.819
Tell me about my mem.

01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:52.131
Who are you people?!

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:55.076
Cool your jets now.

01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:57.795
I think you're prevaricating,
Waldo.

01:03:57.827 --> 01:03:59.651
She says she gave it to you.

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:02.020
Last words the bitch ever said,
so I'm inclined to believe her.

01:04:02.052 --> 01:04:03.620
You know she was still alive

01:04:03.651 --> 01:04:05.188
when I poured the gasoline
on her?

01:04:06.852 --> 01:04:08.131
Fucking kill you!

01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:09.541
Fuck!

01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:12.260
You dirty motherfucker.

01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:18.915
Waldo.

01:04:18.947 --> 01:04:20.132
Lorena.

01:04:20.164 --> 01:04:24.132
Waldo, you've just had
a concussion.

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:26.692
Okay, can you focus?

01:04:28.484 --> 01:04:29.605
Yeah.

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:30.757
The school nurse went home.

01:04:30.788 --> 01:04:32.420
I said I'd take care of you.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.131
Fuck, is it...

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.212
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't confuse you.

01:04:38.245 --> 01:04:40.196
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

01:04:40.228 --> 01:04:42.085
You've just had a concussion,
and...

01:04:43.683 --> 01:04:45.571
Okay, just go really slowly.

01:04:45.603 --> 01:04:48.132
I'll drop you off at Alastair's.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:53.732
Lot of traffic.

01:04:53.764 --> 01:04:55.492
Thanks for taking me home.

01:04:57.251 --> 01:04:59.235
I might have a better idea.

01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:04.771
Do you trust me?

01:05:04.803 --> 01:05:06.915
Why should I trust you?

01:05:06.947 --> 01:05:08.675
Because you'll like it.

01:06:53.892 --> 01:06:57.700
All right.
Well, this is me.

01:06:57.732 --> 01:06:59.171
Have a nice day.

01:06:59.204 --> 01:07:00.325
You too.

01:07:00.356 --> 01:07:04.260
Doing whatever it is
that you do.

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:05.763
I'm late.

01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:07.619
I'm gonna call you.

01:07:07.651 --> 01:07:09.156
I know you will.

01:07:09.188 --> 01:07:12.451
Mr. Lion, did you find
my invitation?

01:07:12.483 --> 01:07:15.363
What are you gonna do?

01:07:15.395 --> 01:07:16.484
About what?

01:07:16.516 --> 01:07:18.628
Your mane is gone.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.067
Can I tell you a secret?

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:21.091
Yes.

01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:23.652
It was stolen by a princess.

01:07:23.684 --> 01:07:25.988
I will get back for you, okay?

01:07:26.019 --> 01:07:27.364
- Will you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:27.396 --> 01:07:29.763
Thank you.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.236
You have a good day.

01:07:31.268 --> 01:07:32.932
I will.

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:10.212
Yes!

01:08:10.244 --> 01:08:11.939
Fuckin' yes!

01:08:13.859 --> 01:08:16.707
Fuckin' yes!
Yes!

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:18.595
Yes!

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:35.460
Mem.
Memory stick.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:57.572
Nini.
It's your old friend Waldo.

01:08:58.243 --> 01:08:59.875
What, cat got your tongue?

01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:03.076
Tell your boss
he can have his mem.

01:09:03.108 --> 01:09:07.140
Meet me tomorrow...
Wilshire and Catalina, 2:00.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.675
Young man, could I ask you
to use your earphones, please?

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:30.308
I mean, those are the rules.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.812
Excuse me.
Who's that you're listening to?

01:09:35.844 --> 01:09:37.444
Oh.
Swag Doggg.

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:38.468
Swag Doggg?

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.460
Yeah.

01:09:39.492 --> 01:09:41.444
All right.
Thank you.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.044
<i>We got to talk about it.
It's all over social media.</i>

01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:53.028
<i>But you're the first
hip-hop artist we've seen</i>

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.044
<i>spell his name D-O-G-G-G.</i>

01:09:55.076 --> 01:09:56.900
<i>What's that about?</i>

01:09:56.932 --> 01:09:59.844
<i>Well, you know that third G
is for the big homie... God.</i>

01:09:59.876 --> 01:10:01.796
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- <i>Oh God, baby.</i>

01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:03.908
<i>Immaculate conception.
You feel me?</i>

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.796
<i>Immaculate concept
that pink purse</i>

01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:07.620
- <i>from around your neck.</i>
- It's a Bottega.

01:10:07.652 --> 01:10:09.252
<i>That is a purse.</i>

01:10:11.492 --> 01:10:12.867
- <i>I brush every...</i>
- <i>Morning!</i>

01:10:12.899 --> 01:10:14.372
- <i>I brush every...</i>
- <i>Night!</i>

01:10:14.404 --> 01:10:15.972
<i>I brush and I brush
till my teeth, they're...</i>

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:19.044
- <i>White!</i>
- <i>Aah!</i>

01:10:19.076 --> 01:10:20.259
Lil Doggg.

01:10:20.292 --> 01:10:22.531
Hey, buddy.

01:10:22.564 --> 01:10:24.772
Earphones.
It's rules.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.564
Sorry.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.612
Hello?

01:10:36.644 --> 01:10:38.404
Waldo?

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:42.308
Nice of you to call.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.684
Where the hell are you?

01:10:43.716 --> 01:10:46.500
I can't say.
Listen.

01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:49.059
There's a guy who's gonna
reach out to you hasn't already.

01:10:49.092 --> 01:10:50.884
Oh, he has.

01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:52.676
He's for real.
Don't mess around.

01:10:52.708 --> 01:10:54.340
I know.
Everyone thinks he killed you.

01:10:54.372 --> 01:10:57.028
He can't if he can't find me.

01:11:02.147 --> 01:11:03.972
Hi.

01:11:04.004 --> 01:11:06.820
I'm writing a piece for <i>Esquire</i>
on the new face of hip-hop.

01:11:06.852 --> 01:11:08.259
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:09.636
Sir, are you okay?

01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:12.644
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

01:11:12.676 --> 01:11:13.540
Could I have that, please?

01:11:15.587 --> 01:11:18.596
Back up, Nini.
It's all right. I got this.

01:11:19.556 --> 01:11:20.995
It's pretty fucking bold of you

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:22.948
to be disrespecting me
like that,

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.020
especially in light
of Lorena's final hours.

01:11:26.052 --> 01:11:29.092
You should've seen her fuckin'
eyes when I lit that match, bro.

01:11:29.124 --> 01:11:30.980
She was crying,
snot coming down her nose...

01:11:31.012 --> 01:11:33.156
I just talked to her.

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.179
Now.

01:11:35.172 --> 01:11:37.315
So why don't we cut the bullshit
and you tell me

01:11:37.348 --> 01:11:40.676
why Lorena was messing with you
in the first place.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.812
Hey, if you don't want
that flash drive,

01:11:43.844 --> 01:11:46.276
I could always give it
to the police.

01:11:46.948 --> 01:11:48.612
Go get yourself
an ice cream cone.

01:11:48.644 --> 01:11:50.308
Get yourself
an ice cream cone.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.668
Strawberry.
Like your shirt.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.644
Come on. Relax.
Relax.

01:11:56.676 --> 01:11:58.116
You're so tense.

01:11:58.148 --> 01:12:00.676
Everything all right?
No problems at home?

01:12:00.707 --> 01:12:02.692
I just want you to know
you can talk to me, all right?

01:12:02.724 --> 01:12:04.772
About anything.

01:12:04.803 --> 01:12:07.396
Lorena was working for me,
all right?

01:12:08.612 --> 01:12:10.116
Not what you think.

01:12:10.148 --> 01:12:12.004
Marital surveillance
on behalf of my sister,

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.244
watching my lazy-ass
brother-in-law.

01:12:14.851 --> 01:12:17.668
Lorena comes to see me at this
chop shop I use as an office.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.036
She sees my mem sitting there.
The bitch palms it.

01:12:20.068 --> 01:12:21.988
She walks out the office
like it's nothing.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.620
Calls me later
saying it's collateral

01:12:23.651 --> 01:12:25.667
on what she claims
I already owe her.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.612
All right. Look.
I think I got this.

01:12:28.964 --> 01:12:31.524
- You open to a suggestion?
- What you got?

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.444
All right.
I give you the mem.

01:12:33.476 --> 01:12:35.364
You let Lorena come back to L.A.

01:12:35.396 --> 01:12:37.316
We whack up the rest
in small-claims.

01:12:37.348 --> 01:12:38.276
- Yeah?
- Simple.

01:12:38.308 --> 01:12:39.908
It's so simple.

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.764
I can't believe I didn't
fuckin' think of that before.

01:12:41.796 --> 01:12:43.108
What are you, fuckin' nuts?

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.932
I got a reputation to uphold,
Waldo.

01:12:44.964 --> 01:12:47.395
- Are you aware of that...
- Assbags against the wall.

01:12:47.428 --> 01:12:49.667
- Motherfucker!
- Jesus Christ.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.972
If you're looking for Jim's
flash drive, you're out of luck.

01:12:52.004 --> 01:12:54.180
- I didn't bring it.
- What'd you just say, Waldo?

01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:55.171
Sorry.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.548
You got a permit for this?

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.508
- No.
- Nah.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.267
I am arresting both of you

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.860
for the murder
of Lorena Nascimento.

01:13:03.908 --> 01:13:05.956
You want to read your boy here
the 6:00 news or what?

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:08.515
Lorena's alive.
I just talked to her.

01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:09.604
- What?
- Yeah.

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:11.139
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

01:13:11.172 --> 01:13:12.868
Well, who was in her car, then?

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.364
I say you both suck
at your jobs.

01:13:15.396 --> 01:13:17.380
Cuppy was never gonna book us
anyway.

01:13:17.411 --> 01:13:19.587
Just another play to squeeze me.
Ain't that right, Cuppy?

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.380
You know I'm the only one
in town who doesn't grease

01:13:21.412 --> 01:13:23.204
this motherfuckin'
cocksuckin' motherfucker?

01:13:23.236 --> 01:13:24.868
- Little man...
- Whoa.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.172
...you... you'd better
watch your mouth

01:13:27.204 --> 01:13:30.788
on days that you're followed
around by that douchebag Eskimo.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.259
What?

01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:34.980
What the...

01:13:35.012 --> 01:13:38.340
He's an Inuit,
you fuckin' philistine.

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:39.491
Let's go.

01:13:39.524 --> 01:13:41.476
You got another 24 hours, Waldo.

01:13:41.507 --> 01:13:43.236
Okay.

01:13:43.268 --> 01:13:46.307
Come on.
Let's get you up, Cuppy.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.196
Oh.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.532
Hi.

01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:52.388
Do you have a school directory
I can look at

01:13:52.419 --> 01:13:55.844
with the names of the students
in each class and their parents?

01:13:55.876 --> 01:13:57.731
It's for Jayne White.

01:14:03.587 --> 01:14:06.148
Thank you.

01:14:11.204 --> 01:14:13.443
Swag Doggg.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.668
Jamshidi.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.172
Listen. I'm on to something.

01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:21.188
What do you know about
Darius Jamshidi and Swag Doggg?

01:14:21.219 --> 01:14:23.780
Are those animated characters?

01:14:23.812 --> 01:14:25.956
They both wanted me to stay
the hell away from your case.

01:14:25.988 --> 01:14:27.876
I went to the school today
and checked the directory.

01:14:27.908 --> 01:14:29.540
They're parents...

01:14:29.572 --> 01:14:31.748
They're parents
in your daughter's class.

01:14:31.779 --> 01:14:33.732
Now, I'm thinking that Monica
could've been into something

01:14:33.764 --> 01:14:35.140
with these other parents

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.964
and one or more of them
wanted her dead.

01:14:36.995 --> 01:14:39.267
Question is, though, what the
fuck is going on in that class?

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.635
Oh, who knows?
Show-and-tell.

01:14:41.668 --> 01:14:43.012
Finger painting. I don't know.

01:14:43.044 --> 01:14:44.804
- Hey! Princess!
- What?

01:14:44.836 --> 01:14:46.820
I'm trying to save your life.
You want to cut the self-pity?

01:14:46.852 --> 01:14:48.484
- Self-pity?
- Look.

01:14:48.515 --> 01:14:50.979
You got a terrific little girl
who already lost her mom.

01:14:51.012 --> 01:14:52.451
Does she have to lose a dad?

01:14:52.484 --> 01:14:53.892
Nobody talks to me that way.

01:14:53.924 --> 01:14:55.748
- And do you know why?
- 'Cause they need the money.

01:14:55.779 --> 01:14:57.603
No, because they know they'll
get a damn good drubbing.

01:14:57.636 --> 01:14:59.236
Put 'em up.
Come on. Your turn, love.

01:14:59.267 --> 01:15:00.324
You'll get a real fight.

01:15:00.356 --> 01:15:01.443
I'm not doing this.

01:15:01.476 --> 01:15:02.980
- Come on.
- I'm not doing this.

01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:04.771
- Alastair, you're too drunk!
- Slippery joker.

01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:06.180
- Alastair...
- Hold still, will you?

01:15:06.212 --> 01:15:08.548
It's not even a fair fight!
You're twice my age!

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.355
Okay. Look. I'm a pacifist,
and I refuse to get involved.

01:15:12.388 --> 01:15:13.636
J...

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:15.908
Alastair?

01:15:15.939 --> 01:15:17.636
Well earned, sir.

01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:19.268
Have you had enough?

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.580
I've had enough.

01:15:20.612 --> 01:15:23.140
Let's you and I have a drink.
Help me up.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.436
Oh, you've trimmed the hedges.
Handsome devil.

01:15:28.804 --> 01:15:31.172
You remember
having mates, don't you, Waldo?

01:15:31.203 --> 01:15:33.060
Not like you.

01:15:33.668 --> 01:15:34.787
There you go.

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.676
You were right, of course.

01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:39.299
I <i>am</i> shit-faced.

01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:40.644
More than usual.

01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:42.436
Chin-chin.

01:15:42.467 --> 01:15:46.307
You know what you should have
done when your young man died?

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:49.924
You should have gone on
an epic two-week pub crawl,

01:15:49.955 --> 01:15:52.835
gotten it all out
of your system.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.579
To self-pity.
Hm.

01:15:56.611 --> 01:15:59.907
That was a powerful observation
coming from the master.

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.484
You and I are two sides
of the same coin, aren't we?

01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:06.820
And now, here you are,
back among the living

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.740
in a way you weren't
just a week ago.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.084
Mm.

01:16:10.115 --> 01:16:11.875
- Oh, you see a difference?
- Mm!

01:16:11.908 --> 01:16:14.276
All the difference in the world.

01:16:14.307 --> 01:16:17.027
Dicking refuckulous the way
you confronted me out there.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.196
You didn't have that in you when
you first shuffled onto my set

01:16:20.228 --> 01:16:23.140
with that rat's nest of a beard
and those dead eyes.

01:16:23.173 --> 01:16:25.604
You've been brought back
to life, mate,

01:16:25.636 --> 01:16:27.973
like so many of us...

01:16:28.004 --> 01:16:31.395
by singular carnal charms.

01:16:35.684 --> 01:16:38.468
Is Jayne keeping the baby?

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.835
I think about her all the time.

01:16:40.868 --> 01:16:42.308
But I haven't thought it right
to telephone,

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.163
given the circumstances.

01:16:44.197 --> 01:16:48.068
And I was such a cad,
especially after she told me.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.651
But I was married, after all,
and what was I to do?

01:16:51.684 --> 01:16:55.780
And then after the business
with my sweet Monica...

01:16:55.813 --> 01:16:58.211
I'm tired, Waldo.

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.196
Fearing that you may not be
as good as others believe.

01:17:04.227 --> 01:17:05.699
It's common to all men.

01:17:06.884 --> 01:17:11.620
But fearing that deep down
you may be a monster...

01:17:12.707 --> 01:17:15.491
...that's a whole different
flavor of hell.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.964
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:34.787
<i>we are about to begin.</i>

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.964
<i>Please find your seats.</i>

01:17:46.948 --> 01:17:48.517
Hey.

01:17:49.412 --> 01:17:50.819
Hey.

01:17:52.227 --> 01:17:54.308
You should have told me
about you and Alastair.

01:17:55.011 --> 01:17:57.924
There's nothing to tell.
He's a kindergarten dad.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.500
Don't worry. It's not Alastair.
It's me.

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:09.284
I found this burner
in his house.

01:18:09.315 --> 01:18:11.300
On the night his wife died,
he texted back and forth

01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.795
with someone, inviting her over.

01:18:13.828 --> 01:18:17.317
Someone... who said
she'd be right there.

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:21.124
Come on.

01:18:21.157 --> 01:18:22.564
Let's talk.

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:30.404
Did you have a thing
with Swag Doggg too?

01:18:31.395 --> 01:18:32.963
Yes.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.195
And that crazy rich guy
Jamshidi?

01:18:39.107 --> 01:18:40.804
You know,
I've been getting beaten up

01:18:40.835 --> 01:18:43.684
and threatened all week
because of you.

01:18:43.715 --> 01:18:45.157
It had nothing to do
with Monica Pinch.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:46.691
It was a bunch of rich guys

01:18:46.724 --> 01:18:48.644
that didn't want their affairs
with you exposed.

01:18:48.675 --> 01:18:50.499
What do you want, Waldo?

01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:53.828
I'm a thrill-seeker, and I'm
teaching fucking kindergarten.

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.291
And what could be a bigger rush
than sleeping with the detective

01:18:56.324 --> 01:18:58.660
investigating a death
you're involved in?

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.059
It wasn't just that.

01:19:02.084 --> 01:19:04.164
I really felt something.

01:19:07.684 --> 01:19:09.604
Start from the beginning.

01:19:09.635 --> 01:19:11.108
And no bullshit.

01:19:14.053 --> 01:19:16.868
I was hoping that he would leave
his wife.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.068
But he was an asshole,
and he kept talking about

01:19:20.099 --> 01:19:23.524
how she wanted him to move back
to England with her.

01:19:23.557 --> 01:19:27.301
Like, he didn't give a shit
about what I was telling him.

01:19:27.332 --> 01:19:30.915
And after that,
total radio silence.

01:19:30.947 --> 01:19:35.395
But I kept texting him,
which was... probably stupid.

01:19:36.388 --> 01:19:39.012
And then one night, he...
he messaged me back

01:19:39.044 --> 01:19:41.411
saying that...
that Monica was out of the house

01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:43.556
and I should come over
and we could talk about us.

01:19:43.588 --> 01:19:46.051
And before I can even ring
the bell,

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:49.444
Monica opens the door
and tells me to come inside.

01:19:49.477 --> 01:19:50.979
She's holding his phone.

01:19:51.011 --> 01:19:53.221
She's the one who messaged me
to come over.

01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:57.988
She tells me Alastair's
passed out in the study and...

01:19:58.021 --> 01:20:00.740
she wanted to see who it was.

01:20:00.771 --> 01:20:02.821
When she found out
it was her daughter's teacher,

01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:05.379
she got pretty unhinged.

01:20:05.797 --> 01:20:08.195
Kept talking about...

01:20:09.155 --> 01:20:13.028
...how L.A. was this evil city
and...

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:15.811
what a mistake it was
coming to L.A.

01:20:16.803 --> 01:20:20.611
I was scared
she was gonna get violent, so...

01:20:20.643 --> 01:20:21.891
I just ran out of there.

01:20:21.925 --> 01:20:22.916
I drove away.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:25.861
And then...

01:20:27.428 --> 01:20:30.692
...the next day,
I heard Monica was dead.

01:20:31.299 --> 01:20:34.244
And I tried reaching out
to Alastair,

01:20:34.275 --> 01:20:37.540
but... he was even more
of an asshole.

01:20:37.572 --> 01:20:39.811
He wouldn't talk to me,

01:20:39.843 --> 01:20:42.308
not even when he was
dropping Gaby off.

01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:45.668
So...

01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:50.275
Well, when the... when the chips
started falling on him...

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.291
...I just let them fall.

01:20:59.684 --> 01:21:02.948
And you're pregnant?

01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:04.100
Alastair's?

01:21:08.932 --> 01:21:11.876
Jayne?
We're about to start.

01:21:12.836 --> 01:21:14.275
Yeah.

01:21:14.852 --> 01:21:16.388
Be right there.

01:21:16.419 --> 01:21:18.692
Can we pick this up later?

01:21:20.228 --> 01:21:22.660
After the play and lawyers.

01:21:27.172 --> 01:21:30.212
There's her necklace
and her ring.

01:21:30.244 --> 01:21:33.892
Next I'll take the child
as the king!

01:21:33.925 --> 01:21:35.845
Today I brew.

01:21:35.876 --> 01:21:37.892
Tomorrow I bake.

01:21:37.924 --> 01:21:42.147
And then the prince child
I'll take!

01:21:42.179 --> 01:21:44.772
For no one knows
my little game,

01:21:44.804 --> 01:21:47.524
and Rumpelstiltskin is my name!

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.205
To guess my name?

01:21:51.236 --> 01:21:55.204
She'll never guess!

01:22:03.812 --> 01:22:05.668
Jayne?

01:22:45.603 --> 01:22:47.588
That girl from "Louisiana Law."

01:22:47.619 --> 01:22:49.539
What's her name? Yeah.
I need you to call her agent.

01:22:49.571 --> 01:22:50.980
I mean, is she pregnant
or is it...

01:22:51.012 --> 01:22:53.283
I don't know. She's unhappy?
'Cause it's weird.

01:22:53.315 --> 01:22:54.788
I mean,
I don't know if she changed

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.540
what she's eating, but...

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.236
You tell me.

01:22:59.268 --> 01:23:00.931
But they're feeding her
something very, very strange,

01:23:00.963 --> 01:23:02.915
'cause I have never seen a shape
quite like that.

01:23:03.524 --> 01:23:04.964
Waddling through the lot.

01:23:04.996 --> 01:23:06.691
And I-I was like,

01:23:06.723 --> 01:23:09.892
"It's not gonna work.
I don't want to look at that."

01:23:10.595 --> 01:23:11.845
All right.
Well, you tell him.

01:23:11.876 --> 01:23:12.932
All right. Bye.

01:23:12.964 --> 01:23:13.924
Mr. Waldo!

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:15.620
Mr. Sikorsky.

01:23:15.652 --> 01:23:18.532
Apologies for the interruption,
but I made some progress.

01:23:18.565 --> 01:23:20.772
Oh, you did?
Fantastic.

01:23:20.804 --> 01:23:21.955
What is that?

01:23:21.987 --> 01:23:23.492
That, my friend, is signed

01:23:23.524 --> 01:23:26.404
by every quarterback
who ever won two Super Bowls.

01:23:26.436 --> 01:23:27.715
May I?

01:23:27.747 --> 01:23:29.156
Please.
Be my guest.

01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:32.005
May I also say it is so good
to see your baby face

01:23:32.036 --> 01:23:33.860
peeking out
where once a dead animal lay.

01:23:33.892 --> 01:23:35.876
And just when you thought I
couldn't get any more handsome.

01:23:35.908 --> 01:23:39.844
I have a run-through, but, um...
fuck 'em.

01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:41.892
I want to hear this.
Shoot.

01:23:41.924 --> 01:23:44.292
It's good news, I guess.

01:23:44.324 --> 01:23:45.604
I know who killed Monica Pinch.

01:23:45.636 --> 01:23:46.979
Fantastic.

01:23:47.011 --> 01:23:49.285
I mean...

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.532
Mm.

01:23:50.564 --> 01:23:53.252
There's a young lady
named Jayne White.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.196
She was the Pinch girl's
kindergarten teacher.

01:23:56.228 --> 01:23:59.587
What'd a kindergarten teacher
want to kill Monica Pinch for?

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.668
She and Alastair were having
an affair.

01:24:03.812 --> 01:24:05.540
You don't look surprised.

01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:07.139
They had a complicated marriage.

01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:09.220
Well, you knew them pretty well.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:11.652
Knew them well.
We did St. Bart's last year.

01:24:11.684 --> 01:24:15.108
I'm just so fuckin' relieved
it's not Alastair, you know?

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.771
- I'm sure you are.
- I knew you were my guy.

01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:18.148
Fontella said,
"Don't hire that bum.

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:19.876
He stinks in every way."

01:24:19.908 --> 01:24:22.020
But I was like, "No.
That's my guy."

01:24:22.052 --> 01:24:23.780
And do I know casting
or do I know casting?

01:24:23.812 --> 01:24:25.443
Is this chick in custody?

01:24:25.475 --> 01:24:26.724
Are we good?

01:24:26.756 --> 01:24:28.612
- Jayne?
- Yeah.

01:24:28.644 --> 01:24:29.892
No.

01:24:29.924 --> 01:24:31.748
- No. She left town.
- Ah, we'll find her.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.276
She's a fuckin' kindergarten
teacher, not Whitey Bulger.

01:24:34.308 --> 01:24:36.196
That's a win-win for Waldo
and Sikorsky.

01:24:36.228 --> 01:24:38.532
You get the killer.
I get to keep my syndication.

01:24:38.564 --> 01:24:42.595
I mean, it's a tragedy, but,
you know, as tragedies go...

01:24:42.627 --> 01:24:43.812
- Mm.
- But thank you.

01:24:43.844 --> 01:24:45.092
You know, great job and...

01:24:45.124 --> 01:24:46.820
Did you know Jayne White?

01:24:48.644 --> 01:24:49.988
I know <i>of</i> her.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.972
Did you know that Alastair
had gotten her pregnant?

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.732
- Hey.
- I'm just wondering

01:24:53.764 --> 01:24:55.620
if that was something
many people were aware of.

01:24:55.652 --> 01:24:58.116
Many people? No.
This is inner-circle stuff.

01:24:58.148 --> 01:25:00.228
Right, but...
you're in the inner circle.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.020
I <i>founded</i> the inner circle.

01:25:02.052 --> 01:25:04.004
You know, he knows what I'm
doing, if you know what I mean.

01:25:04.036 --> 01:25:05.860
I know what he's doing,
if you know what I mean.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.236
So what was Monica Pinch's
reaction

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.996
when she found out
Jayne White was pregnant?

01:25:09.028 --> 01:25:10.756
- She was devastated.
- I bet.

01:25:10.788 --> 01:25:12.548
I mean, she probably
pushed Alastair even harder

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:14.020
to quit the show
and move back to England.

01:25:14.052 --> 01:25:15.684
I can't speak to that
'cause I don't know her

01:25:15.716 --> 01:25:18.340
- as well as I know him.
- Right.

01:25:18.372 --> 01:25:20.164
But you knew about the awards.

01:25:20.196 --> 01:25:22.019
The Shakespeare Awards
you talked about?

01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:23.428
They're called Regis,
by the way.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.835
What did you say?

01:25:24.867 --> 01:25:27.332
You said they were all
under the bed.

01:25:27.364 --> 01:25:28.932
Under the bed, in the attic.
Doesn't matter.

01:25:28.964 --> 01:25:30.020
He just didn't want them around.

01:25:30.052 --> 01:25:31.716
Ah. Gotcha.
It's funny.

01:25:31.748 --> 01:25:33.860
- They <i>were</i> under the bed.
- So?

01:25:33.892 --> 01:25:35.748
It's just Alastair said
he wasn't sure where they were.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.444
- It's not a big deal.
- Listen.

01:25:37.476 --> 01:25:39.876
This is great chatting with you,
but time is not my friend.

01:25:39.908 --> 01:25:41.540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll let you go.

01:25:41.572 --> 01:25:43.075
Thanks.

01:25:43.107 --> 01:25:44.099
Monica Pinch.

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.500
- Quickly.
- Monica Pinch.

01:25:46.532 --> 01:25:49.092
Now, she didn't find out
that Jayne White was pregnant

01:25:49.124 --> 01:25:50.372
until the night she died.

01:25:50.404 --> 01:25:52.324
So if she talked to you
about it,

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.116
it must have been then, right?

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:59.780
Uh, I'm gonna have to back you
up a second there, Mr. Waldo.

01:26:01.379 --> 01:26:03.524
You said that Jayne White
was the murderer.

01:26:03.556 --> 01:26:06.211
Oh, no. I said I knew
who the murderer was.

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:09.027
Oh!

01:26:09.699 --> 01:26:11.300
Warren Gomes.

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:12.867
Does that name mean anything
to you?

01:26:13.284 --> 01:26:15.172
- No.
- Well, he was this lawyer.

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:16.771
I had a little bit
of a weird thing with him.

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.339
He kept following me
for a couple days,

01:26:18.372 --> 01:26:21.156
and I kind of lost my temper
and I confronted him one day.

01:26:21.188 --> 01:26:22.564
We got into a little fight.

01:26:22.596 --> 01:26:23.844
A couple hours later,
he got killed.

01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:25.315
Yeah?

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:26.788
I'm just trying to piece
everything together.

01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.380
The question is...
why bring it up...

01:26:29.412 --> 01:26:31.300
he had the same kind of watch
as you.

01:26:31.332 --> 01:26:32.676
Rich lawyer.

01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:34.308
That's what I thought.
Only I researched them.

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.971
They'll all individually made,
right?

01:26:36.004 --> 01:26:37.763
No two are identical.

01:26:38.212 --> 01:26:40.004
Here's the thing...
The one he was wearing,

01:26:40.036 --> 01:26:42.595
- it looked a lot like yours.
- Pure coincidence.

01:26:42.627 --> 01:26:44.900
This one hasn't left my wrist
except when I shower and sleep.

01:26:44.932 --> 01:26:46.756
But you asked Fontella
what time it was.

01:26:46.787 --> 01:26:48.099
What? When?

01:26:48.132 --> 01:26:50.371
At the courthouse
after Alastair's arraignment.

01:26:50.404 --> 01:26:52.484
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

01:26:52.516 --> 01:26:53.572
But, uh...

01:26:53.604 --> 01:26:55.140
Oh, fuck it.

01:26:55.171 --> 01:26:56.324
Take a seat.

01:26:56.356 --> 01:26:57.636
I want to hear everything
you're thinking,

01:26:57.668 --> 01:26:58.915
soup to nuts, all right?

01:26:58.948 --> 01:27:00.484
- Soup to nuts?
- Yes, please.

01:27:00.516 --> 01:27:02.948
- Double-fuck the read-through.
- Let's do that. Let's do it.

01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.036
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:04.964 --> 01:27:06.595
Buckle up.

01:27:09.124 --> 01:27:10.787
Well, I'm thinking...

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:16.388
...that you knew what
Monica Pinch kept under her bed

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.180
'cause you were spending time
in her bedroom

01:27:18.211 --> 01:27:20.356
while Alastair was spending time
with Jayne.

01:27:23.652 --> 01:27:25.028
Mr. Waldo!

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.884
That is brilliant.

01:27:28.356 --> 01:27:30.756
I'm thinking
that on the night she found out

01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:33.732
that he'd gotten Jayne pregnant,
with Alastair passed out cold,

01:27:33.764 --> 01:27:35.780
I'm thinking
that Monica called you

01:27:35.812 --> 01:27:38.468
to tell you she was gonna
tell Alastair about your affair

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.972
to get him to quit the show
and move back to England,

01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:41.412
like she'd been wanting.

01:27:41.444 --> 01:27:42.756
But you couldn't afford
to lose Alastair,

01:27:42.788 --> 01:27:44.739
not with the Jamshidi
takeover threat.

01:27:44.772 --> 01:27:47.971
I'm thinking that you drove
over there.

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.180
You were gonna talk some sense
into Monica.

01:27:50.212 --> 01:27:51.811
But she didn't want to hear it.

01:27:51.844 --> 01:27:53.124
Next thing,
you guys are arguing.

01:27:53.156 --> 01:27:55.012
It escalates,
and you pick up the Regis Award.

01:27:55.044 --> 01:27:56.259
And you hit her with it.

01:27:56.867 --> 01:27:58.884
You didn't mean to do it.
It's an act of passion.

01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:00.996
Thing is, she's hit her head
on the way down,

01:28:01.028 --> 01:28:02.724
and now she's not moving.

01:28:02.756 --> 01:28:04.868
So you panic,
and you start wiping down

01:28:04.899 --> 01:28:06.436
everything you can remember
touching.

01:28:06.467 --> 01:28:08.484
But the Regis Award
was on a wooden table,

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.244
and that had bloodstains on it.

01:28:10.276 --> 01:28:12.964
Now, I'm thinking...
I'm just thinking...

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:16.004
maybe you were worried that
some of that was your blood.

01:28:16.036 --> 01:28:18.148
You could've got cut
in the fight.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.780
So now what do you do?

01:28:19.811 --> 01:28:21.860
You swap around some furniture.

01:28:21.892 --> 01:28:23.524
You set the alarm
on the way out.

01:28:23.556 --> 01:28:25.348
You get rid of the Regis
in some dumpster,

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:30.244
and you let poor old Alastair
wake up to take the rap.

01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:32.196
How did I do?

01:28:36.964 --> 01:28:38.499
Come on.

01:28:38.532 --> 01:28:40.323
And the lawyer guy?
What...

01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:42.148
He blackmailed you.

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:44.036
He even made you cough up
that fancy watch,

01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:47.076
which you couldn't resist
taking back after you shot him.

01:28:48.099 --> 01:28:49.444
Huh?

01:28:51.331 --> 01:28:53.859
That is quite brilliant.

01:28:53.892 --> 01:28:56.260
In fact, I should give you
a pilot deal.

01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:58.307
There <i>is</i> one gaping hole
in your narrative, however.

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:01.316
Why would I sabotage the biggest
asset on this network?

01:29:01.348 --> 01:29:02.884
Come on.
That's the easy part.

01:29:02.916 --> 01:29:04.164
You told me yourself

01:29:04.196 --> 01:29:06.084
the scandal made the show
twice as valuable.

01:29:06.116 --> 01:29:07.876
You knew Alastair would get off.

01:29:07.907 --> 01:29:09.827
I mean, it's L.A.
The star always gets off.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.580
And in the meantime,
the more publicity,

01:29:12.611 --> 01:29:14.019
the bigger the windfall.

01:29:14.052 --> 01:29:15.587
So what do you do?

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.148
You hire the lawyer
who'll make the most noise

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.196
and then the detective
who would make the most noise,

01:29:20.228 --> 01:29:22.404
even though your lawyer
kept telling you

01:29:22.436 --> 01:29:24.260
I'd be a shitty choice.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.988
And let's be honest.
I <i>am</i> a shitty choice.

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.196
I've never been a P.I.
The LAPD fucking hates me.

01:29:28.227 --> 01:29:31.332
I'm so rusty,
I'd probably be useless.

01:29:31.364 --> 01:29:34.083
But I think you liked me
for those reasons.

01:29:35.139 --> 01:29:36.932
'Cause that made me
the last detective

01:29:36.963 --> 01:29:40.644
who'd ever figure out
that you killed Monica Pinch.

01:29:41.796 --> 01:29:43.044
<i>And</i> Warren Gomes.

01:29:46.532 --> 01:29:48.964
A lot of moving parts.

01:29:50.307 --> 01:29:52.356
A lot of moving parts.

01:29:55.811 --> 01:29:58.083
I do have one question.

01:29:58.116 --> 01:30:01.732
What made you so sure

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:04.612
that you walk in here
and deliver that little pitch?

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:09.412
I'll be honest.

01:30:09.444 --> 01:30:11.588
I only walked in 98% sure.

01:30:11.619 --> 01:30:12.964
Ah.

01:30:16.067 --> 01:30:17.891
What was the other 2%?

01:30:17.924 --> 01:30:20.708
I had to make sure
you were a lefty.

01:30:24.644 --> 01:30:26.883
I did make one mistake, though.

01:30:26.916 --> 01:30:30.756
I really should've waited
until the cops got here.

01:30:30.788 --> 01:30:33.124
You... You told them to come?

01:30:33.155 --> 01:30:35.396
Well, if I timed it right,
they're already downstairs.

01:30:35.427 --> 01:30:39.140
Of course...
I don't have a watch.

01:30:41.124 --> 01:30:42.884
After you.

01:30:42.916 --> 01:30:46.531
Yeah. You just keep smiling.

01:30:46.564 --> 01:30:48.548
Watch your haircut.

01:30:49.956 --> 01:30:52.228
Come on.
Look alive, fellas.

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.796
Pete couldn't make it himself?

01:30:53.828 --> 01:30:55.524
You know he's not gonna let you
out of this collar, right?

01:30:55.556 --> 01:30:57.155
I'm gonna head
to North Hollywood.

01:30:57.188 --> 01:30:58.532
Tell Pete I'll meet him there.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.316
See you in court!

01:31:01.347 --> 01:31:03.236
What are you doing?!

01:31:03.267 --> 01:31:05.891
Get off my bike!

01:31:05.924 --> 01:31:07.748
We're not cops, man.
We're... We're extras.

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.027
Shut the fuck up.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.556
Fuck! Fuck!

01:31:33.924 --> 01:31:38.435
<i>Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

01:32:53.924 --> 01:32:55.204
Fuck!

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:04.739
...Lady Justice.

01:33:04.771 --> 01:33:07.107
Make sure that
he isn't prejudiced

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.220
or predispositioned...

01:33:09.253 --> 01:33:11.491
Fuck!

01:33:11.524 --> 01:33:14.020
"For 99 days, you do that,

01:33:14.053 --> 01:33:17.571
and justice, in its natural
wisdom, will find its own way.

01:33:17.604 --> 01:33:19.268
But, Johnnie," he'd say...

01:33:20.387 --> 01:33:22.436
"...on the 100th day,

01:33:22.467 --> 01:33:27.397
a great judge knows
that he needs to <i>be</i> justice."

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.748
- Ready for your close-up?
- Wait! Wait!

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.253
"...I do know
that as I sit here today..."

01:33:33.284 --> 01:33:35.395
How are you gonna get away
with this?

01:33:35.428 --> 01:33:37.891
A light fell on set.
Happens all the time.

01:33:37.924 --> 01:33:39.555
Last looks.

01:33:42.788 --> 01:33:46.564
...and find
this here defendant... guilty.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.548
What the fuck?
This place is fallin' apart.

01:34:00.997 --> 01:34:02.564
Waldo.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.291
Hey, Q.

01:34:11.939 --> 01:34:14.276
- Well, that's that, then.
- Yeah.

01:34:14.307 --> 01:34:16.739
Would it be ungrateful
to ask what you're doing here?

01:34:16.771 --> 01:34:19.971
I've been following you
since the recruiting office.

01:34:20.004 --> 01:34:22.820
I even had to sit through
that Rumpelstiltskin bullshit.

01:34:22.851 --> 01:34:24.579
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:34:25.444 --> 01:34:26.980
How'd you get on the lot?

01:34:27.013 --> 01:34:29.828
Snuck in on a studio tour.
Yeah.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:31.524
They really need to check out
their security.

01:34:31.556 --> 01:34:34.693
I could be, like, a crazy
stalker or something, you know?

01:34:34.724 --> 01:34:37.477
I, uh, hope you don't mind.
I used your gun.

01:34:38.468 --> 01:34:40.771
I was never here.

01:34:40.804 --> 01:34:41.987
Yeah.
I can work with that.

01:34:42.788 --> 01:34:44.164
Grand.

01:34:45.188 --> 01:34:47.715
You do know why I saved
your ass, right?

01:34:48.771 --> 01:34:50.884
- Yeah, I got an idea.
- Mm.

01:34:53.379 --> 01:34:55.556
Someone else kills you first,
I can't get what I want.

01:34:55.588 --> 01:34:57.028
It'll be a mess.

01:34:57.059 --> 01:34:58.660
Nobody will know what to do
with themselves.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:02.147
You know, I got to say, Q,
it's not too clever

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.771
keeping your kind of business
records on a flash drive.

01:35:04.804 --> 01:35:07.011
Is that what Cuppy thinks
is on there?

01:35:07.684 --> 01:35:09.157
Business records.

01:35:09.188 --> 01:35:12.548
The guy's an idiot.

01:35:12.579 --> 01:35:16.195
Why?
What <i>is</i> on there?

01:35:16.228 --> 01:35:17.732
Epic poem.

01:35:19.108 --> 01:35:21.059
Long-ass motherfucker, too.

01:35:21.091 --> 01:35:23.108
It's the only copy I got.

01:35:23.139 --> 01:35:25.091
Epic poem that you wrote?

01:35:25.124 --> 01:35:26.533
Yeah, that I wrote.

01:35:26.564 --> 01:35:28.804
- Ah.
- It's about the life of a dealer

01:35:28.835 --> 01:35:30.659
trying to retain
his independence and integrity

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:33.475
in an era
of corporate-style cartels.

01:35:33.956 --> 01:35:35.876
Why an epic poem?

01:35:35.908 --> 01:35:38.308
See, me, I'm an autodidact.

01:35:38.339 --> 01:35:41.348
Means I'm self-educated.
I had to enrich my own life.

01:35:41.379 --> 01:35:44.740
But my little girl, Dulcy...

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:48.421
I'm gonna make sure my daughter
gets a real education.

01:35:48.452 --> 01:35:52.004
That way, she ain't stuck
being no cop, no dealer.

01:35:52.035 --> 01:35:53.924
I want to give the poem to her

01:35:53.955 --> 01:35:56.132
so she can see the man
I really am.

01:35:57.731 --> 01:35:59.876
Waldo, I need my mem.

01:35:59.908 --> 01:36:03.781
I need Lorena to come back,
so...

01:36:03.812 --> 01:36:05.507
I'll tell you what.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.788
I want you to get my little girl

01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.251
into that fancy-ass
private school.

01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:11.300
Same one as that
British dude's kid.

01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:14.500
Get him to help Dulcy
and bring me back my mem,

01:36:14.532 --> 01:36:16.675
and Lorena can come back.

01:36:16.708 --> 01:36:18.788
Have you got the juice for that?

01:36:18.819 --> 01:36:21.668
You know, I just might.

01:36:24.132 --> 01:36:28.323
Okay, Waldo.
You got another 24 hours.

01:36:30.148 --> 01:36:33.923
By the way,
I love Johnnie's bench.

01:36:39.397 --> 01:36:41.027
You know,

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.012
my granddaddy once said...

01:36:47.172 --> 01:36:50.468
"...It's one thing to write
like a poet...

01:36:50.948 --> 01:36:54.435
...and another thing altogether
to write like a historian.

01:36:57.284 --> 01:37:01.285
A poet can rehash
or sing about things

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:05.125
not like they were
but like they should have been.

01:37:07.748 --> 01:37:09.508
And the historian...

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:12.132
...well, he's got to write
about them

01:37:12.164 --> 01:37:13.732
not like they
should have been..."

01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:15.395
Fuckin' Lorena.

01:37:15.428 --> 01:37:17.507
"...but like they were...

01:37:19.203 --> 01:37:22.660
...without adding or subtracting
anything from the truth."

01:37:24.068 --> 01:37:25.444
And might I remind you,
Counselor,

01:37:25.476 --> 01:37:28.835
you're getting dangerously close
to rufflin' my feathers.

01:37:28.868 --> 01:37:30.691
Do you understand the words
"contempt of court"?

01:37:31.811 --> 01:37:33.124
Come in.

01:37:34.212 --> 01:37:36.772
Aha!
The man of the hour.

01:37:36.805 --> 01:37:39.652
Come here.
Deftly done, my old cockalorum.

01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:40.932
No tongues.

01:37:40.964 --> 01:37:42.756
Come in. Sit down.
Sit.

01:37:42.788 --> 01:37:45.123
I want to lavish praise on you.

01:37:46.628 --> 01:37:48.580
Is it too much of a cliché
to say...

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:50.276
I don't know how to thank you?

01:37:50.308 --> 01:37:52.931
Is it too much of a cliché
to say I might have an idea?

01:37:52.964 --> 01:37:54.915
- Shoot.
- I'm thinking you were right

01:37:54.948 --> 01:37:56.804
about that epic
two-week pub crawl.

01:37:56.835 --> 01:37:58.084
That's a brilliant idea.

01:37:58.116 --> 01:38:00.068
Unfortunately, as of today...

01:38:02.948 --> 01:38:06.339
...this is my liquor of choice.

01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:09.476
- Sober as a judge.
- Yes.

01:38:09.508 --> 01:38:11.556
Very good.

01:38:11.588 --> 01:38:13.381
I may drop dead any second,

01:38:13.412 --> 01:38:15.332
but at least now
I'm not inviting it.

01:38:16.324 --> 01:38:18.788
I made a shambles of everything,
Waldo.

01:38:18.819 --> 01:38:20.515
Monica's gone.

01:38:20.547 --> 01:38:23.140
Jayne's run off with her son
or daughter... I may never know.

01:38:24.387 --> 01:38:28.227
On the other hand,
I do have my sweet Gaby.

01:38:28.259 --> 01:38:29.508
And the least I owe her

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.460
is the best I have.

01:38:31.492 --> 01:38:34.083
That could take more courage
than drinking yourself to death.

01:38:34.115 --> 01:38:36.580
Don't I know it.

01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:38.819
Courage, mate.

01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:41.060
Cheers.

01:38:41.092 --> 01:38:43.268
- Ready for you, Mr. Pinch.
- Yes. Let's off.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:45.892
And, uh, don't tell anyone
about this.

01:38:45.925 --> 01:38:47.555
If they think I'm still a drunk,

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.371
they'll still let me paste
the occasional pretty boy.

01:39:02.308 --> 01:39:04.196
I got your text.

01:39:05.667 --> 01:39:08.228
Thanks for squaring things
with Q.

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.467
And yet all you talked about
was Pinch.

01:39:10.885 --> 01:39:12.900
I wanted you to do that, too.

01:39:12.932 --> 01:39:14.564
I hope I didn't cause you
too much trouble.

01:39:14.596 --> 01:39:17.572
Oh, not at all.
I made some new friends.

01:39:17.924 --> 01:39:19.492
Well, if you're up for it,

01:39:19.525 --> 01:39:21.188
I've got something else
we could work together.

01:39:21.219 --> 01:39:23.043
You know,
I don't think my face can take

01:39:23.075 --> 01:39:24.068
much more of your action.

01:39:24.099 --> 01:39:25.348
Oh, stop being such a princess.

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.811
You know you loved
every minute of it.

01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:30.052
You look good.

01:39:30.085 --> 01:39:32.036
Yeah.
You look pretty good yourself...

01:39:32.068 --> 01:39:33.475
for a dead woman.

01:39:33.507 --> 01:39:34.756
How'd you pull that off?

01:39:34.788 --> 01:39:36.964
A coroner down in San Berdoo
owed me a favor.

01:39:36.996 --> 01:39:38.852
They let me have a Jane Doe
they were gonna cremate.

01:39:38.884 --> 01:39:41.251
So I burned her
in my ex-husband's car.

01:39:41.283 --> 01:39:42.532
Ex-husband?

01:39:42.565 --> 01:39:44.995
- Almost ex.
- Mm.

01:39:45.572 --> 01:39:47.620
What, you want me to tell you
if it what bothers me

01:39:47.652 --> 01:39:50.052
that you got married?

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.100
I don't need you to tell me.

01:39:54.627 --> 01:39:57.156
And you disappeared on me.
I don't owe you anything.

01:39:57.188 --> 01:39:58.788
Hey, I didn't say you did.

01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:00.805
Why don't you tell me
what happened to your beard?

01:40:02.916 --> 01:40:04.420
Who was she?

01:40:04.452 --> 01:40:05.572
You were dead.

01:40:05.605 --> 01:40:07.492
Barely!
My body wasn't even cold.

01:40:07.525 --> 01:40:08.485
I was grieving.

01:40:08.516 --> 01:40:11.140
Oh, you know what?
Fuck it.

01:40:12.963 --> 01:40:15.332
So that's it? You just breeze in
and breeze back out?

01:40:15.364 --> 01:40:17.092
You ghosted me for three years.

01:40:17.125 --> 01:40:19.876
Then I drive up your stupid
mountain, and you're Ice Man.

01:40:19.908 --> 01:40:21.924
Then you come out here,
one week in L.A.,

01:40:21.956 --> 01:40:23.812
and you've got some little...

01:40:23.844 --> 01:40:25.315
You know what?
Forget it, Waldo.

01:40:25.347 --> 01:40:26.916
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.348
Fuckin' Lorena.

01:40:46.244 --> 01:40:50.564
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:40:50.596 --> 01:40:52.356
Fuck me.

01:41:08.196 --> 01:41:11.172
Give you a ride somewhere?

01:41:11.204 --> 01:41:12.644
In this?

01:41:12.676 --> 01:41:15.364
What's it get,
four miles to the gallon?

01:41:15.396 --> 01:41:16.676
It's a C 300.

01:41:16.708 --> 01:41:18.660
I dropped 55K on it,
and I fucking love it.

01:41:18.692 --> 01:41:21.476
So what's it gonna take
to get you to shut up about it?

01:41:22.436 --> 01:41:24.452
Let me drive?

01:41:24.484 --> 01:41:26.372
Jesus, Waldo.
