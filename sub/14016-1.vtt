Come on, Lennie.

01:20.994 --> 01:22.325
He's okay.

01:22.396 --> 01:23.556
What? For a kid?

01:23.630 --> 01:27.589
I've got ties older than him
and some shoes, too, I think.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.932
I'd like it if you two
really became partners.

01:31.004 --> 01:34.531
Well, I'd like it if both my ex-wives
got new partners. No more alimony.

01:34.608 --> 01:39.045
And I'd like at least a token
effort at the chain of command.

01:41.882 --> 01:43.611
Is that all?

01:44.184 --> 01:46.846
That's all.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:51.858 --> 01:55.419
Yes, I'll tell him. Go to bed now, okay?
I'll see you in the morning.

01:55.495 --> 01:56.689
I love you.

01:58.665 --> 02:00.530
My daughter says good night.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.659
Right back at her.

02:02.736 --> 02:03.998
She's funny.

02:04.070 --> 02:07.335
She feels bad because you don't have
anyone to tuck you in at night.

02:10.776 --> 02:14.543
Oh, yeah? Now, let me guess
where she got that idea.

02:14.614 --> 02:16.013
Kids hear things
out of context.

02:16.082 --> 02:17.674
Right, because my particulars

02:17.751 --> 02:20.276
are the hot topic of conversation

Got it.

You know, it's a funny thing Rey,

your back, I worry about mine.

her about a half hour ago.

He was looking for soda cans, lifted
up the plywood, and there she was.

02:50.317 --> 02:51.579
Any ID?
No.

02:51.651 --> 02:54.211

for a schoolbag or purse.

02:57.858 --> 03:00.986
Time of death, 6 to 10 hours.
Unknown cause.

03:01.061 --> 03:03.325
We got a hematoma on the
right side of her head,

03:03.396 --> 03:05.023
and abrasions on
the palms of her hands.

03:05.098 --> 03:08.534
Oh, man. What
is she, 12, 14?

03:08.602 --> 03:10.467
Somewhere in there.

03:10.537 --> 03:11.902
Take a Polaroid,
show it around,

03:11.972 --> 03:13.940
maybe somebody knows her
from the neighborhood.

03:14.007 --> 03:18.068
Not this neighborhood.
This blazer's from Paul Stuart.

Kid's a long way from home.

03:20.113 --> 03:21.137
What's that smell?

03:21.214 --> 03:24.308
It's mothballs from this
sheet she was wrapped in.

03:24.384 --> 03:28.150
All right. Bag her hands and roll her.
And tell whoever's working the day shift

Yeah. Not exactly what
her folks had in mind.

I was trying to get my baby to sleep.

04:38.858 --> 04:40.485
She's teething.
Yeah. I'm sorry.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.323
Look, I've been there.

give me a call, okay?

04:44.064 --> 04:47.556

This is Detective Briscoe.

If it's about that body they
found, I can't help you.

05:06.753 --> 05:08.277
I was in bed watching TV.

05:08.355 --> 05:09.822
Least till the
cavalry showed up.

05:09.889 --> 05:11.823
You mind if I get myself
a glass of water?

05:11.891 --> 05:13.688
I've been huffing up
these stairs all night.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.695
Make yourself at home.
Water's in the kitchen.

05:16.763 --> 05:17.923
Uh-huh!

05:19.332 --> 05:20.321
Krutsky.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.494

I'm retired from the postal service.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.197
Disability, on
account of my feet.

05:25.271 --> 05:27.102
Look, I wanna get
back to my breakfast.

05:27.173 --> 05:29.198
Oh, be my guest.

05:29.275 --> 05:31.266
So, you stay home
most of the time, huh?

05:31.344 --> 05:33.574
That's right,
minding my own business.

05:33.647 --> 05:37.913
Right. And sitting in this chair
and watching the world go by, huh?

05:37.984 --> 05:40.817
It's a pretty nice
roost. Better than TV.

05:40.887 --> 05:44.687
So did you happen to catch the play-by-play
action in the vacant lot last night?

05:44.758 --> 05:47.488
Bums and drug addicts,
I don't wanna mess with.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.051
Can you leave now?
I like eating in private.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.394
Come on, Mr. Krutsky,
a little girl got killed.

05:52.465 --> 05:55.263
You were a public servant once.
You wanna help us out here?

05:55.335 --> 05:58.168
All I saw was a couple of
crackheads doing their thing.

05:58.238 --> 06:00.934
They cleared out about 10:00.
That's when I went to bed.

06:01.007 --> 06:03.976
Anything out of the ordinary?

06:04.044 --> 06:05.841
Well, there was this van.

06:05.912 --> 06:08.540
It came by two or three
times, just before 10:00.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.242
I thought maybe they
were looking for drugs.

06:10.316 --> 06:12.341
What kind of van?
A white van.

06:12.419 --> 06:15.047
I couldn't make out
a license plate. Okay?

06:15.922 --> 06:17.480
Goodbye now.

06:21.461 --> 06:24.430
Off the bat, I don't see any
signs of sexual trauma.

06:24.497 --> 06:27.091
I guess killing her
was traumatic enough.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.727
Brain hemorrhage in
the right temporal lobe.

06:29.803 --> 06:32.931
Judging by the rate of seepage, death
was within 20 minutes of the injury.

06:33.006 --> 06:34.701
That being the bump on the
right side of her head.

06:34.774 --> 06:36.002
Mmm-hmm.

06:36.076 --> 06:38.670
Hematoma's about the size
of an adult fist,

06:38.745 --> 06:41.145
but she didn't go
down without a fight.

06:41.214 --> 06:44.581
There were bruises on her upper arms,
probably from being pinned down.

06:44.651 --> 06:46.414
And she had bruises
on her knuckles.

06:46.486 --> 06:48.545
So she got in a few
punches. Good for her.

06:48.621 --> 06:50.452
Dietrich saw abrasions
on her hands.

06:50.523 --> 06:54.357
I found glass shards embedded
in her palms and in her hair,

06:54.427 --> 06:57.123
and that's it, gents,
quick and dirty.

06:57.197 --> 06:59.028
Anything else you want to see?

07:01.034 --> 07:03.400
They ran her through Missing Persons.
Nothing yet.

07:03.470 --> 07:08.169
I'm not worried. Girl in a Paul Stuart blazer,
somebody's bound to report her missing.

07:08.241 --> 07:10.471
What about the doer,
he leave a calling card?

07:10.543 --> 07:12.135
Well, the rape kit's negative.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.476
Forensics has the girl's
clothes and the sheet,

07:14.547 --> 07:17.380
and there was a white
van reported in the area.

07:17.450 --> 07:18.474
What about the sheet?

07:18.551 --> 07:20.178
The label's from
a mail-order place.

07:20.253 --> 07:21.242
Rey?

07:21.755 --> 07:23.086
The sheet?

07:23.156 --> 07:24.180
Oh!

07:25.358 --> 07:27.952
Blue and white queen flannel
top sheet, part of a set.

07:28.027 --> 07:30.359
The company stopped carrying
it about four years ago.

07:30.430 --> 07:31.727
They don't have any records.

07:31.798 --> 07:34.062
Maybe we can match up the MO.

07:34.134 --> 07:38.571
Go back a year, attempted abductions,
reports of children being approached.

07:38.638 --> 07:39.627
BRISCOE: Lot
of overtime.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.003
Lucky you.

07:41.074 --> 07:43.474
Start with attempts on girls
matching our Jane Doe.

to favor a type.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

07:47.380 --> 07:48.938
Detective Briscoe,
there's a call.

07:49.015 --> 07:50.209
Thanks.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.716
Detective, close the door.

07:58.158 --> 08:00.888
This thousand-yard stare...

08:00.960 --> 08:03.121
Anything behind it I
should be concerned about?

08:03.196 --> 08:05.357
No. No. It's
just this kid.

08:06.499 --> 08:09.366
I see her lying on the slab, and I can't
help thinking it could be one of my...

08:09.435 --> 08:12.996
But it isn't. Look, if you're
going to bug out over every vic,

08:13.072 --> 08:14.903
I can't use you.

08:14.974 --> 08:17.169
Best therapy?
Clear the case.

08:18.278 --> 08:20.007
Missing Persons got a hit.

08:20.079 --> 08:24.743
Jody Gaines, 12, domiciled
at 450 East 88th.

08:24.818 --> 08:26.979
Father reported her
missing last night.

08:31.891 --> 08:34.655
Yes, that's her.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.592
What happens now?

08:38.664 --> 08:40.496
Well, there's some
forms to fill out.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.432
Then we'd like to talk to you.

08:42.501 --> 08:44.800
We'll also want to
talk to your wife.

08:44.871 --> 08:46.463
My ex-wife.

08:46.539 --> 08:51.101
She doesn't know. I wanted to wait
until I was certain it was Jody.

08:52.979 --> 08:53.968
Is there a phone?

08:54.047 --> 08:55.537
Yeah. In the hallway.

08:55.615 --> 08:57.708
She can meet us
down at the precinct.

08:59.285 --> 09:02.516
MR. GAINES: On Wednesdays, Jody
takes piano lessons after school,

09:02.589 --> 09:05.023
on the West Side, on 76th.

09:05.091 --> 09:06.752
The school bus drops her off.

09:06.826 --> 09:08.225
How does she get home?

09:10.196 --> 09:13.188
Her piano teacher calls
a car service for her.

09:13.266 --> 09:15.029
Sounds like you
had her covered.

09:16.502 --> 09:18.470
I tried to protect my daughter.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.400
Then when I got home at
7:00, she wasn't there.

09:23.476 --> 09:25.603
She was supposed
to go to your place?

09:25.678 --> 09:28.875
MR. GAINES: She lives with me.
The court gave me custody.

09:33.486 --> 09:39.618
Anyway, I called her music teacher.
He said she never showed up for her lesson.

09:39.692 --> 09:40.784
I called the school.

09:40.860 --> 09:46.093
The vice-principal said she remembered
seeing Jody get on the bus.

09:46.165 --> 09:50.864
Mrs. Gaines, could she have skipped her
piano lesson and gone to visit you?

09:50.937 --> 09:55.533
No, she knows I work late.
I'm a buyer for Bloomingdale's.

09:55.608 --> 09:59.305
Anyway, she wouldn't miss her lesson.
She loved to play piano. She...

10:02.749 --> 10:07.311
Did she ever mention that someone
was watching her or following her?

10:07.387 --> 10:08.684
No.

10:09.389 --> 10:11.289
She would've told me.

10:12.025 --> 10:15.893
I warned my daughter about the kinds
of people that are out there.

10:15.962 --> 10:17.759
Who else knew
about her schedule?

10:19.232 --> 10:23.225
My housekeeper. Mr.
Behrens, piano teacher.

10:24.337 --> 10:26.066
And the people at her school.

10:34.747 --> 10:36.772
They have to be asking
themselves the question.

10:36.849 --> 10:38.248
What question is that?

10:38.318 --> 10:41.617
Well, if the family was still
together, maybe the girl'd be alive.

10:41.688 --> 10:42.916
How do you figure?

10:42.989 --> 10:46.083
Come on, divorced parents are so busy
making a new life for themselves,

10:46.159 --> 10:48.354
the kids end up falling
through the cracks.

10:48.428 --> 10:52.091
So, you think they should've toughed
it out together under the same roof?

10:52.165 --> 10:54.531
Studies prove it, Lennie.
Kids are better off.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.933
Or we might be talking about two
dead bodies instead of one.

11:02.608 --> 11:06.203
Fourteen years on the job,
I never lost a kid.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.638
When you catch up with
the pervert that did this,

11:08.715 --> 11:09.909
I'd like a few
minutes with him.

11:09.983 --> 11:11.143
Take a number.

11:11.217 --> 11:15.483
Now, yesterday, where exactly on
76th Street did you drop her off?

11:15.555 --> 11:18.023
Right in front of the building
where her piano teacher lives.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.752
And you waited till
she went inside?

11:19.826 --> 11:20.850
Yeah, sure.

11:20.927 --> 11:22.292
I saw her open the door.

11:22.362 --> 11:24.694
CURTIS: You didn't see
anybody else on the street?

11:24.764 --> 11:26.425
No, I really didn't
pay attention.

11:26.499 --> 11:28.126
Well, maybe the other
kids on the bus did.

11:28.234 --> 11:31.135
It was just Jody and me.
She's my last drop-off on Wednesdays.

11:31.204 --> 11:33.900
I do the East Side first, then I
cut across the park to Columbus.

11:33.973 --> 11:37.704
And you didn't see anything unusual,
like maybe a car following you?

11:37.777 --> 11:41.042
No. I went around the block to
Amsterdam, then up to 76th.

11:41.114 --> 11:42.581
Just the usual traffic.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.975
I swear to you
she never showed up.

11:46.052 --> 11:47.986
Well, we have a witness who
saw her enter your building.

11:48.054 --> 11:50.545
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
She wasn't here.

11:50.623 --> 11:54.115
One of your students skips her do-re-mi's,
and you don't call her folks?

11:54.193 --> 11:55.217
(SIGHS)

11:55.294 --> 11:58.320
Well, the first time
that it happened, I did.

11:58.398 --> 12:00.958
Jody went to FAO Schwarz
with her friends, you know.

12:01.034 --> 12:02.626
She caught hell
from her parents.

12:02.702 --> 12:04.226
What about the second
and third times?

12:04.303 --> 12:07.238
Look, you know, I'm as
horrified as you are,

12:07.306 --> 12:11.208
but if I thought that something had
happened to her, I would've called.

12:11.277 --> 12:15.338
Just out of curiosity, what time was
your next appointment after Jody?

12:15.415 --> 12:19.579
Right after her. Mrs.
Deutsch. All thumbs.

12:20.486 --> 12:23.421
Unfortunately, she
never misses a lesson.

12:23.956 --> 12:27.289
So the girl waits until the bus leaves,
then heads to the nearest video arcade.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.989
Or any other favorite hangout for
your neighborhood chicken hawks.

12:31.097 --> 12:34.032
When I was a kid growing up around here,
the worse thing that could happen to you

12:34.100 --> 12:36.466
was skinning your knee
playing Johnny on the Pony.

12:36.536 --> 12:39.232
Yeah, well, I don't remember things
being so rosy when I was a kid.

12:39.305 --> 12:43.173
Well, when was that, last week?
Come on, let's see if anybody saw her.

12:44.544 --> 12:46.136
So you've never
seen her before, huh?

12:46.212 --> 12:47.270
Um...

12:47.346 --> 12:49.814
No. She wasn't in here.

12:49.882 --> 12:51.747
All right. Thanks.
No problem.

12:54.053 --> 12:55.042
I got nothing, Lennie.

12:55.121 --> 12:56.554
Yeah. Same
story here.

12:56.622 --> 12:57.850
Nobody remembers seeing her.

12:57.924 --> 12:59.619
Everybody's too busy.

12:59.692 --> 13:00.784
Except those guys.

13:01.727 --> 13:04.457
Hey, that's 75th.

13:04.530 --> 13:05.554
Very good.

13:05.631 --> 13:08.031
Now try reading that sign,
it says "Lunch Special."

13:08.101 --> 13:10.228
No, Lennie, the bus driver
said he came down Columbus,

13:10.303 --> 13:13.500
and went around the corner
to come back up to 76th.

13:14.707 --> 13:16.368
Which means he
had to take 75th.

13:16.442 --> 13:18.069
Hey, that's pretty good.

13:21.047 --> 13:23.413
Mind if we tear you away
from your work for a minute?

13:23.483 --> 13:25.451
Was this street open yesterday?
WORKER: No.

13:25.518 --> 13:28.043
Broken water main.
The street was flooded all day.

13:28.121 --> 13:29.782
Okay. Thanks.

13:29.856 --> 13:33.622
I wonder if that bus driver
remembers swimming down the street.

13:33.693 --> 13:37.094
I'm not sure, maybe I cut
across on 75th or 73rd.

13:37.163 --> 13:38.494
73rd was blocked off.

13:38.564 --> 13:39.622
Then I took 75th.

13:39.699 --> 13:42.896
I don't know, Lennie, I'm pretty
sure the broken main was on 75th.

13:42.969 --> 13:45.199
You know Rey, now that I
think of it, you're right.

13:45.271 --> 13:47.671
Look, I just don't remember.

13:47.740 --> 13:50.106
Oh, I sympathize with
your problem, Charlie.

13:50.176 --> 13:52.940
When I was married, I could
never keep my lies straight.

13:53.012 --> 13:54.479
Why you making such a
big deal out of this?

13:54.547 --> 13:55.878
What difference
what street I took?

13:55.948 --> 14:00.009
The deal is we think you took Jody
on a little magical mystery tour.

14:00.086 --> 14:03.544
Now, I'm not a fan, but maybe
knee socks make you horny.

14:03.623 --> 14:07.115
That's sick! I raised four kids
of my own, for God's sake.

14:08.828 --> 14:11.058
That's a lot a mouths to feed.

14:11.130 --> 14:15.294
And you chauffeur those little rich darlings
around for what, a puny 20-grand a year?

14:15.368 --> 14:16.528
Is that why you grabbed
her, for the money?

14:16.602 --> 14:18.502
No, no! Yeah!
You grabbed her.

14:18.571 --> 14:19.902
Only she put up a fight.

14:19.972 --> 14:21.735
And you had to hit her, only
it was a little too hard...

14:21.807 --> 14:23.968
This is crazy!
No! I didn't do that.

14:24.043 --> 14:26.307
Then lay it out for us, pal.
What happened?

14:29.415 --> 14:31.645
This could cost me my job.

14:31.717 --> 14:32.706
For openers.

14:36.322 --> 14:42.852
Okay, look, I dropped her off on
the corner of 76th on Columbus.

14:44.697 --> 14:48.895
The traffic was bad, she didn't want to sit
on the bus while I went around the block.

14:48.968 --> 14:50.799
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's your story?

14:50.870 --> 14:52.861
It's true.

14:52.939 --> 14:57.967
School policy is I drop
them in front of the house,

14:58.044 --> 15:00.239
I wait till they're inside.

15:02.515 --> 15:04.915
If I just did what
I was supposed to...

15:13.926 --> 15:15.757
He's taking it pretty hard.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.022
You believe him?

15:17.096 --> 15:21.624
I ran his name up and down the system.
Nothing, not even a moving violation.

15:21.701 --> 15:24.397
Well, on that note, I'll give him
some Kleenex and send him home.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.961
Well, he told one lie.
He could be telling others.

15:27.039 --> 15:29.507
I want to hold him until
we check out his story.

15:29.575 --> 15:33.306
Hey, we questioned every animate object
in the neighborhood. Nobody saw her.

15:33.379 --> 15:35.813
Look, he said he dropped the
girl at the corner on Columbus.

15:35.881 --> 15:38.782
There's a bank there.
It's got a cash machine.

15:38.851 --> 15:41.581
And cash machines
have security cameras.

15:43.589 --> 15:45.147
I cued up the tape
to where you wanted,

15:45.224 --> 15:47.351
but there was only one
customer during that period.

15:47.426 --> 15:49.360
It's not your customers
we're interested in.

15:49.428 --> 15:50.417
Here you go.

16:04.076 --> 16:05.805
There, that's the bus.

16:05.878 --> 16:07.072
BRISCOE: And
there she goes.

16:09.849 --> 16:12.374
Well, that gets
him off the hook.

16:19.825 --> 16:21.725
Wait, wait. Lennie.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.892
A minute after the girl
walks down the street,

16:27.967 --> 16:31.698
that white van driving
up 76th toward Columbus.

16:31.771 --> 16:35.400
So, the mailman said he saw a white
van cruising the vacant lot.

16:35.474 --> 16:36.566
There's gotta be a
million white vans.

16:36.642 --> 16:40.078
You see the rack on the side of the van?
It's carrying some kind of window.

16:40.146 --> 16:41.636
Yeah. It's a
glazer's truck.

16:41.714 --> 16:43.682
The girl had glass
shards in her hands.

16:47.586 --> 16:49.850
Same goobers built this
camera built the Hubble.

16:49.922 --> 16:52.482
You get better optics
on an Instamatic.

16:52.558 --> 16:54.617
Sorry, Richard Avedon
wasn't available.

16:54.694 --> 16:58.494
First off, these are all side
shots, so no license plate.

16:58.564 --> 17:01.795
I got the driver in
profile for one frame.

17:02.468 --> 17:05.960
Dark hair, maybe,
caucasian or hispanic.

17:06.038 --> 17:07.596
You even sure it's a he?

17:07.673 --> 17:09.867
No, just a politically
incorrect assumption.

17:09.942 --> 17:13.343
What about the lettering on the
side panel, behind the rack there?

17:13.412 --> 17:16.779
SASABE: It's blurred because of
distortion from the glass in the window.

17:16.848 --> 17:18.817
Probably cheap stuff.

17:18.884 --> 17:21.785
CURTIS: I don't know about the glass,
but that window looks pretty expensive.

17:21.854 --> 17:23.549
Can't be too many like it.

17:27.393 --> 17:31.386
What this is, is an arch window
dating from the mid-19th century.

17:31.464 --> 17:32.453
Nice looking piece.

17:32.531 --> 17:34.260
It'd look good
in my living room.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.460
If you could afford the
townhouse that goes with it.

17:36.535 --> 17:38.503
You have a particular one in mind?

17:38.571 --> 17:41.563
There must be nearly a hundred in
Manhattan with this kind of window.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.437
Who fixes these
kind of windows?

17:43.509 --> 17:46.376
Well, any competent
glazer can handle the job.

17:46.445 --> 17:49.573
The trick is keeping
the materials authentic.

17:49.648 --> 17:53.311
Take the panes, it's float glass.
Just like the original.

17:53.386 --> 17:55.854
That's why you
have the distortion.

17:55.921 --> 17:58.651
Going by the amount of waves, I'd
say this glass was mouth-blown.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.124
Doesn't sound like something
a glazer would keep in stock.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.820
It has to be special ordered.

18:02.895 --> 18:05.591
There's only one local
distributor, in Queens.

18:07.366 --> 18:09.334
Float glass?
Could be.

18:09.402 --> 18:11.393
About a third of my
business is in restoration.

18:11.470 --> 18:15.065
Yeah. The distributor said you ordered
three sheets of it a couple of weeks ago.

18:15.141 --> 18:16.472
Yeah. That sounds
about right.

18:16.542 --> 18:19.602
Any chance it found its way into
a 19th century arch window?

18:20.045 --> 18:21.137
Uh-huh!

18:21.213 --> 18:22.544
The job went out
a couple of days ago.

18:22.615 --> 18:25.584
Why, you guys thinking about
remodeling the precinct?

18:25.651 --> 18:28.313
We leave the redecorating
to our lieutenant.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.048
Is this one of your trucks?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.089
You guys want to tell
me what this is about?

18:36.162 --> 18:38.926
We asked first,
Mr. Sullivan.

18:38.998 --> 18:43.162
Yeah, it's one of my trucks.
So? What gives? Hit-and-run?

18:43.235 --> 18:45.703
The driver might've been a witness
to a crime over on the West Side,

18:45.771 --> 18:47.068
a couple of days ago.

18:47.139 --> 18:48.606
We need to talk to him.

18:48.674 --> 18:50.505
I've got over 30 employees,
and off the top of my head,

18:50.576 --> 18:52.601
I don't know who
handled the job.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.305
Why don't you give me your card?
I'll get back to you.

18:54.380 --> 18:58.316
I see on the wall there you got a
certificate from the Gardner Clinic.

18:58.384 --> 18:59.908
Yeah. I've been
sober for over a year.

18:59.985 --> 19:04.422
BRISCOE: Well, then you know how important
it is to your self-esteem to do good works,

19:04.490 --> 19:07.687
and helping your local
police certainly counts.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.921
We'd really like
that information now.

19:16.235 --> 19:17.497
You know the Gardner?

19:17.570 --> 19:20.801
Yeah, I read their
brochure between shots.

19:20.873 --> 19:24.673
Carlos, yeah, who did the
re-install on the Poundstone job?

19:25.744 --> 19:27.302
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:28.247 --> 19:29.475
Okay.

19:31.283 --> 19:34.377
Nick Capetti. He lives in Brooklyn,
but he's on a job right now.

19:35.287 --> 19:38.154
Sure, I was on 76th
Street speccing out a job.

19:38.224 --> 19:39.213
Broken skylight.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.349
Who'd you talk to?

19:40.426 --> 19:43.122
Some old bag.
I don't remember her name.

19:43.195 --> 19:44.389
But you wrote it down, though, right?

19:44.463 --> 19:45.487
I threw it out.

19:45.564 --> 19:48.965
She accused me of gouging, so I
told her, "Fix it yourself."

19:49.034 --> 19:50.399
And where'd you go then?

19:50.469 --> 19:52.334
The Poundstone
place in the Village.

19:52.404 --> 19:53.871
Traffic is nuts,

19:53.939 --> 19:56.169
so by the time I get down
there, it's way past 6:00,

19:56.242 --> 19:59.040
so I bagged it for the day, and
headed for the Lincoln tunnel.

19:59.111 --> 20:01.739
Oh, you took the scenic
route back to Brooklyn?

20:01.814 --> 20:04.612
My mother lives in Newark.
She was expecting me for dinner.

20:04.683 --> 20:07.049
Anybody else at
the dinner table?

20:07.119 --> 20:10.987
No, just me and my mother.
You guys done interrogating me now?

20:11.056 --> 20:12.717
BRISCOE: Hey, there's
no interrogation.

20:12.791 --> 20:14.725
When we interrogate you,
believe me, you'll know it.

20:14.793 --> 20:17.523
So what time did the party
break up at your mom's?

20:17.596 --> 20:20.497
I don't know. I watched
the late news, and I left.

20:20.566 --> 20:23.034
And I'm sure she could vouch
for your whereabouts, right?

20:23.102 --> 20:24.330
Ask the Jersey State Troopers.

20:24.403 --> 20:26.371
They gave me a speeding
ticket on the way there.

20:26.438 --> 20:27.928
All right, then?

20:28.007 --> 20:30.737
Mr. Capetti's been in and out
of the state bed-and-breakfast

20:30.809 --> 20:32.401
for the past 20 years.

20:32.478 --> 20:35.413
Attempted rape, burglary,
another attempted rape.

20:35.481 --> 20:38.109
Killing little girls
wouldn't be a stretch.

20:38.183 --> 20:40.276
The youngest victim here's 22.

20:40.352 --> 20:43.810
Last conviction was in '89
for assault on a shopkeeper.

20:43.889 --> 20:46.449
He was muscle for a
protection scam in Corona.

20:46.525 --> 20:48.220
An all-round bad guy.

20:48.294 --> 20:50.626
You confirm that ticket with
the Jersey State Police?

20:50.696 --> 20:52.687
Lt'd take a few days
to put into the system.

20:52.765 --> 20:54.323
If he even got a ticket.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.334
He's got a dead or dying
girl in the back of his van.

20:56.402 --> 20:59.394
Last thing he's gonna do is drive to
Jersey for his mama's cannelloni.

20:59.471 --> 21:00.904
Hey, a guy's gotta eat, right?

21:00.973 --> 21:02.372
Capetti's got history.

21:02.441 --> 21:05.672
He was at the scene, that should be
enough for us to search his van.

21:05.744 --> 21:07.302
Find a judge.

21:08.213 --> 21:10.511
We went through the van
three times, gentlemen.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.778
I just viewed the
material under the scope.

21:12.851 --> 21:14.409
No fibers from
the flannel sheets,

21:14.486 --> 21:18.479
no fibers from the girl's clothes,
not a strand of hair. Nothing.

21:18.557 --> 21:20.650
Capetti's had some
experience with our methods,

21:20.726 --> 21:22.694
and plenty of time to
clean up after himself.

21:22.761 --> 21:25.025
The girl had cuts on her hands.
There must've been blood.

21:25.097 --> 21:28.430
We didn't find any. Best
we came up with is this.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.331
A teaspoon of glass.

21:30.402 --> 21:32.666
Some of it's a general match
with what was found on the girl.

21:32.738 --> 21:33.762
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

21:33.839 --> 21:35.033
Thanks.

21:37.109 --> 21:38.576
This is Rey.

21:40.012 --> 21:41.377
What time?

21:42.247 --> 21:43.771
All right. Thanks.

21:43.849 --> 21:45.339
Confirmation on
the speeding ticket.

21:45.417 --> 21:48.978
6:56 p.m. On the Turnpike,
coming from the Lincoln Tunnel.

21:49.054 --> 21:51.454
Son of a bitch. They write him up,
and they don't even turn their heads

21:51.523 --> 21:53.650
a half an inch to see what's
in the back of the van.

21:53.726 --> 21:54.818
I don't get this guy, Lennie.

21:54.893 --> 21:57.760
Hey. Hey, he panicked
when the girl kicked.

21:57.830 --> 22:01.095
New plan, drive out to
Mom's and sort things out.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.532
While he's there, why not just
ditch the body in Jersey?

22:03.602 --> 22:06.867
What? Right in his mom's backyard?
Too easy to connect the dots.

22:06.939 --> 22:09.840
No. Better to dump the body
in Manhattan after dinner.

22:09.908 --> 22:11.466
Capetti put some
thought into this.

22:11.543 --> 22:13.738
I wonder how much he
put into his alibi.

22:17.082 --> 22:20.108
I made meatloaf.
Nicky loves my meatloaf.

22:20.185 --> 22:23.211
You know what I like, Mrs.
Capetti? Meatloaf sandwich.

22:23.322 --> 22:26.655
How about Nick, did he make
himself one for the road?

22:26.725 --> 22:29.922
I don't know.
I went to bed.

22:30.963 --> 22:32.430
CURTIS: About what
time was that?

22:32.498 --> 22:33.897
After the news.

22:33.966 --> 22:35.866
Which one do you like to watch, Mrs.
Capetti?

22:35.934 --> 22:39.301
The Chinese girl on Channel 5
or the old guy on Channel 4?

22:39.371 --> 22:40.736
(CHUCKLES)

22:40.806 --> 22:42.899
They all got the same bad news.

22:42.975 --> 22:46.502
Oh, wow! I bet the Giants come
in pretty good on this, huh?

22:47.513 --> 22:49.572
Nicky gave that to
me for Christmas.

22:49.648 --> 22:51.309
To watch the Jets.

22:51.383 --> 22:53.010
What's in here,
Mrs. Capetti?

22:53.085 --> 22:55.485
It's storage.
Just a lot of junk.

22:57.990 --> 23:01.153
Junk made out
of wool? Mothball.

23:01.226 --> 23:04.024
You want to show us what's
in the closet, Mrs. Capetti?

23:05.197 --> 23:06.994
I don't have to.

23:07.066 --> 23:08.499
Well, then you'd better
put on a pot of coffee.

23:08.567 --> 23:10.057
We're gonna call
the Essex County D.A.

23:10.135 --> 23:11.898
And wait for him to come
down here with a warrant.

23:11.970 --> 23:14.939
We'll have to go room by room.
It'll be a hell of a mess.

23:27.853 --> 23:32.620
Rey, flannel pillow
cases, fitted sheet.

23:32.691 --> 23:35.023
The rest of the matching set.

around the back!

Easy, man!

24:11.563 --> 24:12.655
(SCREAMS)

24:12.731 --> 24:15.097
This ought to bring back
fond memories, Nick.

24:15.167 --> 24:18.227
You're under arrest, you have
the right to remain silent,

24:18.303 --> 24:23.331
anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

24:23.408 --> 24:24.966
Why her, Nick?

24:25.043 --> 24:28.444
Just dumb luck, she happened to be in
the right place at the right time?

24:28.514 --> 24:31.950
Maybe you'd seen her before,
you staked her out, right?

24:32.017 --> 24:33.348
CURTIS: A smart guy
like you would do that.

24:33.418 --> 24:37.718
Pay attention, genius, because
now we are interrogating you.

24:39.057 --> 24:40.149
I'm waiting for my lawyer.

24:40.225 --> 24:42.386
Yeah. We're
looking for him.

24:42.461 --> 24:44.395
But I gotta tell you, the only
thing that's gonna help you now

24:44.463 --> 24:46.090
is your cooperation,
some kind of statement

24:46.165 --> 24:48.065
you're sorry for what you
did to that little girl.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.260
It's your only chance
to dodge the needle, Nick.

24:50.335 --> 24:52.929
Yeah, right. You're bubbling over
with concern for my welfare.

24:53.005 --> 24:55.235
We're just saying that if your
intent wasn't to kill her,

24:55.307 --> 24:56.501
that changes things.

24:56.575 --> 25:00.204
You know, last time I checked this was
still the land of the red, white and blue.

25:00.279 --> 25:03.180
I got rights. Now,
get me my lawyer.

25:10.122 --> 25:11.555
(BELL DINGS)

25:14.426 --> 25:16.189
Mrs. Gaines.
Am I too late?

25:16.261 --> 25:19.560
No. They haven't brought him in yet.
Now, why don't you have a seat.

25:22.134 --> 25:25.365
ATTORNEY: My client is on welfare.
How is he expected to meet bail?

25:25.437 --> 25:28.895

Bail is set at $50,000.

Do something!

Are you all right?

26:05.510 --> 26:06.807
No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

26:06.879 --> 26:09.780
Are you sure? Yeah, I can't...
I didn't see what happened.

26:14.319 --> 26:15.581
He killed Jody.

26:15.654 --> 26:18.088
Karen, don't say another word.
I called the lawyer.

26:18.156 --> 26:19.145
I'm sorry.

26:19.224 --> 26:20.851
He's right, Mrs.
Gaines, listen to him.

26:20.926 --> 26:23.656
Anything you say now puts
us in an awkward position.

26:24.663 --> 26:26.392
Capetti's DOA.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.232
What're you doing to her?

26:29.301 --> 26:31.394
She's being charged
with murder. I'm sorry.

26:31.470 --> 26:32.869
Curtis, Mirandize her.

26:32.938 --> 26:34.735
Take her out the garage.
Karen Gaines, you're under arrest

26:34.806 --> 26:37.741
for the murder of Nicholas Capetti.
You have the right to remain silent.

26:37.843 --> 26:38.832
You have the
right to an attorney.

26:38.911 --> 26:40.378
Wait for the lawyer, Karen.

26:40.445 --> 26:42.913
If you can't afford an attorney...
That bastard killed Jody!

26:42.981 --> 26:46.644
How in the hell did she get
that gun into the courthouse?

26:46.718 --> 26:48.845
I don't know.
You don't know.

26:48.921 --> 26:50.821
Well, somebody better find out.

26:50.889 --> 26:54.552
Normal-looking people out there
taking the law in their own hands.

26:54.626 --> 26:57.220
With eight million taxpayers
cheering them on.

26:57.296 --> 26:59.491
They're lining up to pat
Karen Gaines on the back.

26:59.564 --> 27:01.031
Right. Well, it doesn't
take much effort

27:01.099 --> 27:02.657
to put yourself in her shoes.

27:02.734 --> 27:05.931
Unfortunately, she's not the
first parent to lose a child.

27:06.004 --> 27:08.438
That can't justify
premeditated murder.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.270
You want to try
her for murder two?

27:10.342 --> 27:11.809
She had the presence of mind

27:11.877 --> 27:14.937
to smuggle a loaded
weapon into a courthouse.

27:15.013 --> 27:17.140
I have 40 witnesses
who saw her shoot Capetti.

27:17.215 --> 27:18.375
I don't see what
the problem is.

27:18.450 --> 27:21.908
The problem is that your jury will
wish that they pulled the trigger.

27:21.987 --> 27:24.512
If we don't come down
hard on Karen Gaines,

27:24.589 --> 27:26.352
somebody else'll get
the idea that it's okay

27:26.425 --> 27:28.393
to turn another courtroom
into the OK Corral.

27:28.460 --> 27:31.725
And if she gets acquitted,
what message does that send?

27:32.898 --> 27:36.459
I'm not taking that chance.
You're talking to her lawyer.

27:38.370 --> 27:44.331
Mrs. Gaines serves a day in prison for this,
that'll be the day I turn in my license.

27:44.409 --> 27:46.775
As soon as the jury gets a
look at Capetti's record,

27:46.845 --> 27:48.176
at the evidence against him,

27:48.246 --> 27:51.875
they'll line up to shake my
client's hand and send her home.

27:51.950 --> 27:54.612
Only if they ignore the
fact she murdered someone.

27:54.686 --> 27:57.348
Only one thing matters here.
Jody Gaines is dead

27:57.422 --> 28:02.758
because the system failed to keep a piece
of crap like Nick Capetti behind bars.

28:02.828 --> 28:06.924
Well, thanks to my client, Mr.
Capetti's crime spree is over for good.

28:06.999 --> 28:08.660
A compelling
argument, Mr. Greer,

28:08.734 --> 28:11.259
but not half as compelling as
the bullet that hit the wall

28:11.336 --> 28:13.304
three inches from
the court reporter's head.

28:13.372 --> 28:14.361
Mr. McCoy...

28:14.439 --> 28:15.463
GREER: Karen, please.

28:15.540 --> 28:19.067
All I could think about was the
last minutes of Jody's life.

28:19.144 --> 28:20.941
How terrified she must've been.

28:22.314 --> 28:26.580
If I could undo everything,
believe me, I would.

28:34.459 --> 28:36.950
Man one. She
does six years.

28:37.029 --> 28:39.259
We might go for man two.

28:39.331 --> 28:42.232
One and a third years
in minimum security.

28:43.602 --> 28:45.934
Fine, let's not be reasonable.

28:46.004 --> 28:49.167
We're on the side of
the angels, Mr. McCoy.

28:49.241 --> 28:53.268
You force a trial, and
you're in for a hard ride.

28:53.345 --> 28:56.781
What if she pled to man one, and
we request a sentencing hearing?

28:56.848 --> 28:58.816
CLAIRE: We let a judge
decide the sentence.

29:00.218 --> 29:02.584
We'd go along with that.

29:02.654 --> 29:04.417
I'll get back to you.

29:04.489 --> 29:05.513
Karen.

29:11.930 --> 29:14.057
Greer knows we don't want
this in front of a jury.

29:14.132 --> 29:16.999
Neither does he.
I want her to serve time.

29:17.069 --> 29:19.196
Man one carries
mandatory imprisonment.

29:19.271 --> 29:21.068
Right, a big two years.

29:21.139 --> 29:22.470
At a minimum.

29:22.541 --> 29:24.532
But, Jack, don't you think
she's been punished enough?

29:24.609 --> 29:28.306
For God's sake, Claire!
For shooting up a courtroom?

29:28.380 --> 29:31.474
Thanks to her, you had
a near-death experience.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.715
I'm surprised you're
so magnanimous.

29:34.786 --> 29:38.085
CLAIRE: Where in the canon of ethics does
it say we can't show a little mercy?

29:38.156 --> 29:41.489
Because Nick Capetti was
a man in need of killing?

29:41.560 --> 29:44.051
It wasn't up to her to
give him what he deserves.

29:44.129 --> 29:46.927
Then why not let a judge
decide what she deserves?

29:48.934 --> 29:50.162
Okay.

29:51.236 --> 29:53.568
Start working on the
sentence recommendation.

29:57.476 --> 29:59.569
Nick was my only son.

30:01.947 --> 30:04.381
He has three sisters.

30:06.218 --> 30:08.584
After my husband died,

30:09.988 --> 30:13.321
he took care of us
as best he could.

30:14.759 --> 30:18.456
And thanks to that Mr.
Sullivan who gave him a job,

30:20.532 --> 30:22.329
Nick was supporting me.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.130
Your son was convicted
of committing violent crimes,

30:25.203 --> 30:26.636
isn't that right?

30:26.705 --> 30:27.933
He wasn't a saint.

30:29.741 --> 30:31.641
I didn't say he was.

30:32.611 --> 30:35.546
And if he had anything to
do with that little girl,

30:35.614 --> 30:39.311
then he should've
paid by the law.

30:39.384 --> 30:43.115
Now, I could live with
that, but not with this.

30:43.188 --> 30:45.554
What gave you the right
to shoot him like a dog?

30:45.624 --> 30:48.787
Mrs. Capetti, please,
address the court.

31:02.774 --> 31:08.303
Her little girl is dead, and
that's a tragedy for her.

31:10.482 --> 31:13.076
But who is she to kill my son?

31:15.654 --> 31:17.588
What if she was wrong?

31:18.723 --> 31:21.089
What if he didn't do it?

31:28.166 --> 31:31.727
It took three years of
trying before we had Jody.

31:31.803 --> 31:36.365
Karen called her our miracle baby.
She was very devoted to her.

31:36.441 --> 31:40.070
At your divorce, isn't it true, the
court awarded you custody of Jody?

31:40.145 --> 31:43.603
Yes. They found Karen
to be an unfit mother.

31:43.682 --> 31:46.947
At the time, she was dealing with
an addiction to pain killers.

31:47.018 --> 31:49.111
She needed time for herself.

31:49.187 --> 31:52.054
She cleaned up to become
a better mother for Jody.

31:52.123 --> 31:55.559
And after her recovery, what
kind of a mother was she?

31:55.627 --> 31:59.757
She was fantastic.
Spent as much time with Jody as she could.

32:00.498 --> 32:02.363
Then when the police called...

32:06.071 --> 32:09.472
If Jody had died in an accident, we
would've found a way to deal with it.

32:09.541 --> 32:10.940
But this...

32:12.377 --> 32:14.242
He took our child.

32:14.312 --> 32:16.542
And what did the police do?

32:16.615 --> 32:22.576
Gave him a speeding ticket with our
Jody maybe still alive in his truck.

32:22.654 --> 32:26.021
Karen had no faith in
the system, Your Honor.

32:26.091 --> 32:28.958
Not a parent in the world
wouldn't have done what she did.

32:31.029 --> 32:33.759
I'm only sorry I didn't have
the guts to do it myself.

32:41.439 --> 32:45.842
I've heard the testimony, I've
read the pre-sentence report

32:45.910 --> 32:49.903
and Mrs. Gaines' statement
expressing remorse,

32:49.981 --> 32:53.246
but manslaughter in the first
degree is a serious offense,

32:53.318 --> 32:56.719
and that's why the statutes
require mandatory imprisonment.

32:58.757 --> 33:00.748
The defendant will rise.

33:02.894 --> 33:05.590
Karen Gaines, it is
the sentence of this court

33:05.664 --> 33:09.896
that you serve a term of imprisonment
of no more than two years.

33:09.968 --> 33:12.436
Furthermore, this
court will recommend

33:12.504 --> 33:16.838
that your sentence be served at a
halfway house in the city of New York,

33:16.908 --> 33:20.537
and that you be allowed to participate
in a work-release program.

33:20.612 --> 33:22.603
Your Honor...
Sit down, Mr. McCoy.

33:22.681 --> 33:25.047
I'm within my discretion.

33:25.116 --> 33:26.515
We're adjourned.

33:41.866 --> 33:44.300
These are the witness statements
connecting Capetti to the van

33:44.369 --> 33:46.599
and the lab reports connecting
the girl to the van.

33:46.671 --> 33:47.865
It would've been a slam dunk.

33:47.939 --> 33:49.031
Any evidence he had help?

33:49.107 --> 33:53.066
No. And no evidence he'd ever even seen
the girl until the day he grabbed her.

33:53.144 --> 33:55.510
And you're absolutely
sure he was the one?

33:55.580 --> 33:59.482
Oh, yeah. I may not agree with
Mrs. Gaines' brand of justice,

33:59.551 --> 34:02.111
but she did not shoot
an innocent bystander.

34:02.187 --> 34:05.623
All right. Close the case and
send McCoy the final report.

34:05.690 --> 34:07.089
It might cheer him up.

34:07.158 --> 34:09.888
From the looks of this, he'll be
the only one gnashing his teeth.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.521
Mrs. Gaines is
getting a lot of ink.

34:12.597 --> 34:15.760
Rey, look at this.

34:15.833 --> 34:19.860
She was treated for pill addiction
a year ago at the Gardner Clinic.

34:20.138 --> 34:22.402
So she went to Gardner.
So did half of Manhattan.

34:22.474 --> 34:24.772
Including Capetti's
boss, Frank Sullivan.

34:29.914 --> 34:33.782
Yes, I remember Karen Gaines,
and I remember Frank Sullivan.

34:33.851 --> 34:37.481
They underwent treatment during the
same four-week period last year.

34:37.554 --> 34:39.955
Did they have much
contact with each other?

34:40.024 --> 34:46.121
Sure. They were in my therapy
group, they shared meals.

34:46.965 --> 34:50.696
During the group sessions, did
they discuss their personal lives?

34:50.768 --> 34:51.963
Of course.

34:52.036 --> 34:53.799
So Frank Sullivan
would've found out

34:53.871 --> 34:56.864
that Mrs. Gaines had a daughter
and a rich ex-husband.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.738
What are you getting at?

34:58.810 --> 35:02.541
Well, we suspect he might be involved
in her daughter's kidnapping.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.983
Whatever he knew
about her circumstances,

35:07.051 --> 35:09.849
didn't have to come
from the group sessions.

35:09.921 --> 35:11.855
The last couple of weeks
that they were here,

35:11.923 --> 35:15.256
they started having an affair.
Something that we actively discourage.

35:15.326 --> 35:17.226
I had a talk with them,

35:17.295 --> 35:20.230
but they seemed pretty
taken with each other.

35:21.766 --> 35:26.669
Look, the doctor was wrong
then, and he's wrong now.

35:26.738 --> 35:28.603
There was nothing between us.

35:28.673 --> 35:33.269
You gotta admit, it's a little strange you
never bothered to tell us you knew her.

35:33.344 --> 35:34.902
Yeah. Well, I didn't
think it mattered.

35:34.979 --> 35:36.139
Believe me, it matters.

35:36.214 --> 35:38.478
How'd it go down, Frank?
Business a little slow?

35:38.550 --> 35:39.574
You get behind
on your payments?

35:39.651 --> 35:40.913
That's nuts.

35:40.985 --> 35:42.282
You guys know Capetti did it.

35:42.353 --> 35:45.379
Hey, the last time Capetti
had an original idea,

35:45.457 --> 35:47.118
he left it swirling in the bowl.

35:47.192 --> 35:49.387
You're the brain
who thought this up.

35:49.461 --> 35:52.589
As far as we're concerned, Mr.
Sullivan, you're good for it.

35:52.664 --> 35:56.395
You think because I had an affair
with her, that makes me a murderer?

35:56.468 --> 35:57.765
This is unbelievable.

35:57.836 --> 36:00.634
Grand juries don't
like coincidences.

36:02.507 --> 36:03.496
(CHUCKLES)

36:04.342 --> 36:05.707
Read him his rights.

36:05.777 --> 36:06.903
Come on.
On your feet.

36:06.978 --> 36:09.037
Wait a minute. Wait.

36:09.113 --> 36:11.946
Look, you gotta understand,
this wasn't my idea.

36:13.184 --> 36:16.085
Elvis spoke to you
through your car radio?

36:17.722 --> 36:19.212
It was Karen.

36:20.892 --> 36:23.019
Her ex is putting
her through hell.

36:23.094 --> 36:25.289
Wouldn't let her
see her daughter.

36:25.363 --> 36:30.494
Had her tied up with lawyers.
She asked me to help her, but I told her no,

36:30.568 --> 36:32.399
but she keeps pushing.

36:32.470 --> 36:34.563
So I gave her Nick's number.

36:34.639 --> 36:36.072
Your friendly neighborhood rapist?

36:36.140 --> 36:40.702
No, I swear, we did not
know about the rapes.

36:42.213 --> 36:45.614
All she wanted to do
was teach her ex a lesson

36:45.683 --> 36:48.311
about how it feels not to be
able to see your own kid.

36:57.061 --> 37:00.030
I thought of Karen when
Jody first went missing,

37:00.098 --> 37:04.057
but when they found the
body, I never imagined.

37:04.135 --> 37:09.368
We're not saying she was involved.
We find it hard to believe she's capable of it.

37:10.108 --> 37:13.509
Is it? My God, she shot
a man in cold blood.

37:13.578 --> 37:16.706
Something you wished
you'd done yourself.

37:16.781 --> 37:19.750
As I recall, Mr. Gaines, you vouched
for your ex-wife's good character

37:19.817 --> 37:22.149
in front of a packed courtroom.

37:22.220 --> 37:27.157
I said what her lawyer wanted
me to say, I had no idea.

37:27.225 --> 37:30.854
What makes you think Frank Sullivan
isn't lying just to save his own skin?

37:30.929 --> 37:33.193
No. It makes sense now.

37:33.264 --> 37:37.394
Since the divorce, Karen's been
after me to hurt me anyway she can.

37:37.468 --> 37:41.063
She blames me for her
addiction, for losing Jody,

37:41.139 --> 37:43.300
her toaster doesn't
work, it's my fault.

37:43.374 --> 37:46.138
She thinks I'm out to get her.

37:46.210 --> 37:48.974
According to Sullivan, you were
keeping Jody away from her.

37:49.047 --> 37:51.880
Oh, no. No. That's not true.
That was Jody's idea.

37:51.950 --> 37:54.043
She didn't want to
see Karen anymore.

37:54.118 --> 37:56.518
A couple of months ago, she
was late bringing Jody home.

37:56.588 --> 37:57.987
About 12 hours late.

37:58.056 --> 38:01.355
I was going out of my
mind, calling hospitals.

38:01.426 --> 38:05.362
When she got home, Jody was in tears.
She wouldn't tell me why.

38:05.430 --> 38:06.954
See, for the past year,

38:07.031 --> 38:09.693
Karen's been playing head
games on both of us.

38:09.767 --> 38:12.702
I had to send Jody to
a child psychologist.

38:15.707 --> 38:18.267
I never thought
Karen'd go this far.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.511
Like many kids
in her situation,

38:25.583 --> 38:28.575
Jody was the designated
adult in her family.

38:28.653 --> 38:31.486
Making adult decisions,
like not seeing her mother?

38:31.556 --> 38:34.753
Yes. Jody loved
her very much.

38:34.826 --> 38:38.922
And at one time, Mrs.
Gaines probably even deserved that love.

38:38.997 --> 38:42.899
Mr. Gaines mentioned an incident
that took place two months ago.

38:42.967 --> 38:49.429
Mrs. Gaines took Jody up to Tanglewood.
After, she refused to take her home.

38:49.507 --> 38:51.407
They drove around all night.

38:51.476 --> 38:56.345
Mrs. Gaines was on a tear about
her husband controlling her life,

38:56.414 --> 39:00.009
and how he was turning
Jody against her.

39:00.084 --> 39:02.712
Jody was still shaking
when she saw me.

39:02.787 --> 39:04.948
I'm not surprised her
father got custody of her.

39:05.023 --> 39:06.081
(CHUCKLES)

39:06.157 --> 39:08.022
He can dish it out.

39:08.092 --> 39:11.755
A few months ago, Jody was excited
about taking dance lessons

39:11.829 --> 39:14.059
near Mrs. Gaines' work.

39:14.132 --> 39:18.535
Mr. Gaines stopped it,
I think purely out of spite.

39:20.805 --> 39:24.036
Two parents using their
kid to destroy each other.

39:25.176 --> 39:26.837
Wonderful world.

39:27.011 --> 39:29.946
Two bad parents, but only one
of them committed murder.

39:30.014 --> 39:31.641
Whether she killed
Capetti for revenge

39:31.716 --> 39:34.810
or to cover up her own involvement,
jeopardy's attached.

39:34.886 --> 39:36.410
We can't touch her.

39:38.156 --> 39:40.249
We can for her
daughter's murder.

39:40.324 --> 39:43.725
You don't really think she intended
or even thought Jody would be killed.

39:43.795 --> 39:46.559
JACK: She hired a felon to toss her
daughter into the back of a van.

39:46.631 --> 39:48.531
That's kidnapping.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.934
The daughter died as a result.

39:51.002 --> 39:52.060
That's felony murder.

39:52.136 --> 39:54.832
Abducting your own child.

39:54.906 --> 39:57.466
It's not a predicate crime.

39:57.542 --> 40:02.479
Well, you'll say kidnapping, her
lawyer'll say "custodial interference."

40:02.547 --> 40:03.878
And motive separates the two.

40:03.948 --> 40:07.042
Frank Sullivan will testify that she
did it to terrorize her husband.

40:07.118 --> 40:08.551
That makes it kidnapping.

40:08.619 --> 40:12.055
Uncorroborated
accomplice testimony.

40:12.123 --> 40:15.149
That and a dollar-twenty-five
gets you on the subway.

40:16.661 --> 40:18.891
Then we'll get corroboration.

40:21.065 --> 40:24.466
I'm sure she told Capetti
what her intentions were,

40:27.238 --> 40:29.968
and maybe he said
something to his mother.

40:30.041 --> 40:31.440
You hope.

40:33.978 --> 40:36.811
Mrs. Capetti, we
know what happened.

40:36.881 --> 40:39.975
There's no sense protecting
your son anymore.

40:40.051 --> 40:41.643
Leave him alone.

40:43.087 --> 40:45.317
What good does it do anyway?
He's dead.

40:45.389 --> 40:47.448
And the woman who killed him will
get away with another murder

40:47.525 --> 40:49.254
unless you help us.

40:49.961 --> 40:51.553
What do you mean?

40:53.731 --> 40:58.725
Your son did tell you that Mrs.
Gaines hired him to kidnap her daughter?

41:01.005 --> 41:03.200
He didn't mean
to kill the girl.

41:04.275 --> 41:06.106
MRS. CAPETTI: It
was an accident.

41:07.879 --> 41:09.642
He wanted her to be quiet.

41:09.714 --> 41:10.703
JACK: I know.

41:12.784 --> 41:16.481
Did he tell you why she
wanted her kidnapped?

41:16.554 --> 41:18.419
Jack, she doesn't know...

41:18.489 --> 41:19.478
Listen to me.

41:21.826 --> 41:24.454
The more you can tell
us about her involvement,

41:24.529 --> 41:27.657
the better chance we have
of putting her in jail.

41:27.732 --> 41:28.756
Jack.

41:28.833 --> 41:33.566
If your son said anything
at all about her, please,

41:35.940 --> 41:37.237
tell me.

41:46.350 --> 41:48.580
After the girl was hurt,

41:51.189 --> 41:57.560
he said he called Mrs.
Gaines to tell her that the girl was in trouble,

41:59.096 --> 42:01.360
and he wanted to take
her to the hospital.

42:02.934 --> 42:04.959
The lady told him no.

42:07.238 --> 42:13.234
The lady told him they would all
go to jail if anyone found out.

42:13.311 --> 42:16.542
Nick was scared.
He did what she said.

42:17.448 --> 42:21.942
Nick didn't want the girl to die.
It tore him up.

42:24.422 --> 42:27.789
She told him not to go to the hospital.
It's depraved indifference.

42:27.859 --> 42:29.224
Murder two.

42:29.293 --> 42:30.590
It'll be perjury, Jack.

42:30.661 --> 42:34.028
Mrs. Capetti had no idea Karen Gaines
was involved until we told her.

42:34.098 --> 42:38.899
We can't confirm or deny her testimony.
I'm happy to take it at face value.

42:38.970 --> 42:41.370
You practically put
the words in her mouth.

42:41.439 --> 42:44.704
Now, Karen Gaines killed her son,
she has every reason to lie.

42:44.775 --> 42:47.209
And she's very good at it.

42:47.278 --> 42:50.577
I'm sure it's not the first time
she's had to lie for her son.

42:50.648 --> 42:52.639
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

42:52.717 --> 42:55.015
Claire, I want two things,

42:55.086 --> 42:58.351
justice for the dead and
respect from the living.

42:58.422 --> 43:00.447
Mrs. Gaines has to
answer for what she did.

43:00.524 --> 43:03.550
At any cost? You're talking
about suborning perjury.

43:03.628 --> 43:05.186
Just between you and
me and the lamp post,

43:05.263 --> 43:08.198
I have no intention of putting Mrs.
Capetti on the stand.

43:08.266 --> 43:11.702
All I want to do is survive
a motion to dismiss.

43:11.769 --> 43:15.205
As it is, unless we put the
fear of God into Karen Gaines,

43:15.273 --> 43:16.763
she's gonna walk.

43:16.841 --> 43:18.900
Have Curtis and
Briscoe pick her up.

43:22.480 --> 43:27.247
The People's latest murder charge rests
solely on the testimony of Mrs. Capetti.

43:27.318 --> 43:30.185
It's double hearsay, Your Honor,
and therefore, inadmissible.

43:30.254 --> 43:34.623
I admire your stamina, Mr.
McCoy, but let me get this, straight.

43:34.692 --> 43:38.651
You want Mrs. Capetti to tell
us what her son told her

43:38.729 --> 43:40.492
the defendant told him?

43:40.564 --> 43:44.022
I'd rather Nick Capetti
told us himself,

43:44.101 --> 43:47.593
but the defendant made him unavailable
by shooting him in the back.

43:47.672 --> 43:51.164
Even if he was here, his testimony
would still be hearsay.

43:51.242 --> 43:54.769
Statements against penal
interest, exception to hearsay.

43:54.845 --> 43:57.075
JACK: Even though Mrs. Gaines
knew her daughter was dying,

43:57.148 --> 43:59.378
she told Mr. Capetti
not to seek medical help.

43:59.450 --> 44:01.008
According to
Mrs. Capetti,

44:01.085 --> 44:03.781
and there's not a shred of
evidence to support her statement.

44:03.854 --> 44:05.446
Can we even prove
the call was made?

44:05.523 --> 44:08.151
JACK: I don't have to.
I have a pile of evidence on my desk

44:08.225 --> 44:13.527
to show that the defendant set in motion
a reckless and callous chain of events.

44:14.665 --> 44:17.862
Letting her daughter die was
just the final depraved act.

44:17.935 --> 44:19.527
JUDGE: Now, I've
heard enough.

44:19.603 --> 44:23.664
I'm gonna let a jury decide if Mrs.
Capetti is telling the truth.

44:23.741 --> 44:28.075
The hearsay exception applies.
Her statements are admissible.

44:28.145 --> 44:30.409
JUDGE: Motion to
dismiss is denied.

44:31.749 --> 44:36.311
My client is prepared to plead to
custodial interference. Period.

44:36.387 --> 44:38.252
An E Felony?

44:38.322 --> 44:40.688
I hurt myself more shaving.

44:40.758 --> 44:43.522
You're swinging without
a net on murder two.

44:43.594 --> 44:47.030
You think your star witness, Mrs.
Capetti, will hold up on cross?

44:48.599 --> 44:49.725
When the jury hears

44:49.800 --> 44:56.501
how your client paid a convicted
rapist to kidnap her own daughter,

44:56.574 --> 44:58.474
they'll believe her
capable of anything.

44:58.542 --> 45:00.476
He never called me.

45:00.544 --> 45:05.641
How can you think for a minute
that I would let my own child die?

45:05.716 --> 45:08.981
What kind of a mother
do you think I am?

45:09.053 --> 45:10.384
You don't know
what I did for her.

45:10.454 --> 45:13.184
For 10 years, I stayed
in a nightmare marriage

45:13.257 --> 45:15.020
just so she could
have a real home.

45:15.092 --> 45:18.152
I fought for custody for her, but
he had more money, more lawyers.

45:18.229 --> 45:23.633
He turned me into an addict
and then used it against me!

45:23.701 --> 45:26.693
That bastard, he stole
her away from me.

45:26.771 --> 45:30.036
He told her lies about me.
He made her afraid of me.

45:31.442 --> 45:33.137
I loved her.

45:35.813 --> 45:39.010
But you hated
your husband more.

45:49.493 --> 45:52.223
I never meant any
of this to happen.

46:04.442 --> 46:09.106
At most, her conduct was reckless.

46:11.248 --> 46:16.185
Man two. Tack on another year to
the time she's already serving.

46:16.253 --> 46:20.451
Man one. She does six years.
And not one day of it in a halfway house.

46:21.492 --> 46:22.925
Sorry.

46:29.600 --> 46:35.061
It never ends. Mr. Gaines is suing
his ex-wife for wrongful death.

46:35.139 --> 46:37.198
What does he want from her?

46:37.274 --> 46:40.710
The dollar an hour she gets
folding prison laundry?

46:40.778 --> 46:42.905
It's hard to believe
those two were ever in love.

46:42.980 --> 46:45.005
Passionately, I'd say.

46:45.082 --> 46:47.607
Where do you think
all the hate comes from?
