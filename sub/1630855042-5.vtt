All right, Mississippi.

01:05.703 --> 01:08.843
I need a female participant
onstage ASAP.

01:08.843 --> 01:11.181

01:11.181 --> 01:15.022
Oh, I see her right there.
Yes, I do.

01:15.022 --> 01:16.892
I see her.

01:16.892 --> 01:21.168
And, uh, where am I going?
I don't know.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.804
Oh. And, uh...

01:22.804 --> 01:23.906
I love you, Lil Dicky,

You.

01:29.986 --> 01:31.956
Yeah. There she is.

- Hi.
- Hi.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.863
- How you doing?
- FAN: Get off the stage,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.033
you fat fucking whore!

01:37.033 --> 01:40.006
(crowd booing, jeering)

01:51.028 --> 01:53.299
And to the republic,
for which it stands...

01:53.299 --> 01:55.269
- A nation.
- One nation,

01:55.269 --> 01:56.973
- under God...
- Invisible.

01:56.973 --> 01:58.309

Yeah.

01:58.309 --> 02:00.680
VATKA:
The liberty of justice because.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.350
GATA:
Yeah. Kind of close, but,

02:02.350 --> 02:04.654
- yeah.
- Baby, I want you to fuck me
to these words.

02:04.654 --> 02:05.857
Crazy, right?

02:05.857 --> 02:07.093
- (knock at door)
- Oh, Dave, it's her.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.729
- Get up.
- She's here?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.266
Hey. Hi. Yeah, come on in.

02:10.266 --> 02:11.970
Thank you so much.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.272
MEG:
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

02:13.272 --> 02:14.608
Hi.

02:14.608 --> 02:16.879
- I'm Dave.
- Hi.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.117
Hi. (stammers)
I'm-I'm Meg. (laughing)

02:19.117 --> 02:20.386
I'm sorry, I'm just,

02:20.386 --> 02:22.157
I'm such a huge fan.

02:22.157 --> 02:24.361
You're, like, my favorite
rapper of all time. (laughs)

02:24.361 --> 02:25.797
Oh, shit. I'm like your Drake.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.233
- Yeah.
- Cool.

02:27.233 --> 02:29.905
Well, Meg, I just had to
look at you mano a mano

02:29.905 --> 02:31.708
and tell you I'm so sorry about

02:31.708 --> 02:33.879
- what happened tonight.
- Oh, oh, don't worry about it.

02:33.879 --> 02:35.783
I-I mean, it's
a Lil Dicky show, right?

02:35.783 --> 02:38.122
- I get it.
- Oh. Well...

02:38.122 --> 02:39.925
We will make it up to you.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.261
- Mike.
- Yeah?

02:41.261 --> 02:43.032
- Let's get her a T-shirt.
- (Meg gasps)

02:43.032 --> 02:45.169
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What size?
- Yeah.

02:45.169 --> 02:47.740
- Bring the whole box over
so she can pick.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:47.740 --> 02:49.077
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:49.077 --> 02:51.081
We have a full service
operation here,

02:51.081 --> 02:52.884
and we designed all the clothes.

02:52.884 --> 02:54.221
- Oh. Okay.
- MIKE: Check it out. Boom.

02:54.221 --> 02:57.694
And... a Lil Dicky show
is an experience,

02:57.694 --> 02:59.097
and you had the wrong
experience tonight,

02:59.097 --> 03:00.399
so you have to have
the right experience.

03:00.399 --> 03:02.203
Like, what about coming
to another show?

03:02.203 --> 03:04.207
- Uh...
- You want to come to Memphis?

03:04.207 --> 03:06.345
- MEG: Memphis?
- DAVE: Backstage passes.

03:06.345 --> 03:08.449
- Oh, my God. (laughs)
- The whole kit and caboodle.

03:08.449 --> 03:11.321
Oh, wow, um,
that is so generous,

03:11.321 --> 03:13.726
but, um, I don't have a car.

03:13.726 --> 03:16.298
- Oh.
- So... yeah.

03:16.298 --> 03:19.938
- Well, we have a tour bus.
- It's full.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.775
- It's... (clears throat)
It's full, sadly.
- No.

03:21.775 --> 03:23.812
- It's not full.
- No?

03:23.812 --> 03:25.082
- DAVE: She's riding
to Memphis with us.
- MIKE: Is she? Okay.

03:25.082 --> 03:26.351
DAVE:
Yeah, she's my ride or die.

03:26.351 --> 03:27.387
DAVE:
If she doesn't ride, we all die.

03:27.387 --> 03:29.024
Are you serious?

03:29.024 --> 03:30.293
Yeah, we're gonna have
the time of our lives

03:30.293 --> 03:31.762
traveling across America.
What do you say?

03:31.762 --> 03:32.998
- Oh, my gosh, okay, yeah!
- DAVE: Yeah?

03:32.998 --> 03:34.901
- All right. Yeah.
- (screams, laughs)

03:34.901 --> 03:36.772
It's gonna be so fun. You can't
shit on the bus, though, at all.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.742
- Oh, okay.
- DAVE: Yeah.

03:38.742 --> 03:40.246
- Uh, sure.
- It's not just you,
it's everybody can't shit.

03:40.246 --> 03:41.949

- Oh, so

04:12.877 --> 04:15.049
my DJ has this urgent
Zoom meeting that just came up,

04:15.049 --> 04:16.885
and the rats ate
our Wi-Fi thing, so...

04:16.885 --> 04:18.222
- I hate to intrude.
- Yeah.

04:18.222 --> 04:20.026
Any way we can just pop in
for 20 minutes

04:20.026 --> 04:21.395

And then we'll be on our way.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.305
I mean, it's not very fancy.

04:26.305 --> 04:28.742
Oh, no, it looks, uh,
slice of life, in a good way.

04:28.742 --> 04:30.279

she got cancer or something.

- I still live with my parents.
- Oh. That's cool.

04:38.829 --> 04:41.034
Like, living with my parents
was my favorite part of life,

04:41.034 --> 04:44.474
you know? It all starts
with the birth.

04:44.474 --> 04:47.347
Hey, Meg, what's the Wi-Fi?

04:47.347 --> 04:50.786
Oh, uh, "I live for him,"
one word, all caps.

04:50.786 --> 04:52.457
Wow, you are a big fan.

04:52.457 --> 04:55.796
Oh, no. "Him" is Jesus.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.802
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah. Um, I'll set you up

04:58.802 --> 05:00.473
- in Aaron's room
right down the hall.
- Oh, thank you so much.

05:00.473 --> 05:01.775
- Mm-hmm.
- GATA: Hey, Megabyte,

05:01.775 --> 05:03.045
where the bathroom at?

05:03.045 --> 05:04.314
Oh, uh, right down that way.

05:04.314 --> 05:06.051
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:08.389 --> 05:12.096
You know, what I need
is a tour of the home.

05:12.096 --> 05:14.934
You know? I got to know
what makes Meg Meg.

05:14.934 --> 05:15.971
Uh, okay.

05:15.971 --> 05:18.842
- Take me, my lady.
- Okay...

05:18.842 --> 05:22.550
my, um...
Well, here's the family room.

05:22.550 --> 05:24.421
I used to know all this shit.

05:24.421 --> 05:26.892
MEG:
Uh, a lot of
happy memories here.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.099
(heavy rain outside)

05:30.099 --> 05:31.835
DAVE:
Wow, it's...
it's starting to come down.

05:31.835 --> 05:32.837
Check this out.

05:34.007 --> 05:36.011
Aw, you got it.

05:36.011 --> 05:37.814
- Yeah.
- Man, yeah.

05:37.814 --> 05:39.384
Like, there were so many rounds
of notes with this thing

05:39.384 --> 05:41.254
to make it not look albino.

05:41.254 --> 05:42.857
'Cause it, like, looks like

05:42.857 --> 05:44.561
an albino Black man.
You see what I'm saying?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.832
Yeah. I-I think it looks
just like you.

05:46.832 --> 05:48.002
- (both laugh)
- Oh, my gosh.

05:48.002 --> 05:49.404
Yeah, I get all your stuff.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.875
I-I think you are
a satirical genius.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.014
- (sighs) Thank you.
I appreciate that.
- (laughs) Yeah.

05:54.014 --> 05:55.282
Like your song "White Guy,"

05:55.282 --> 05:57.420
I totally get it.
I see all the irony,

05:57.420 --> 05:58.957
- all the layers. Yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

05:58.957 --> 06:01.128
I love how y-you take
these big ideas

06:01.128 --> 06:02.998
and, and you subvert them

06:02.998 --> 06:04.401
and y-you get the point across
through the humor in your music.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.836
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:05.836 --> 06:07.573
Ah, cool. I mean, yeah, like,

06:07.573 --> 06:09.411
what-what are people
like out here?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.048
'Cause I, honestly,
I wasn't really vibing

06:11.048 --> 06:12.884
with the crowd last night,
to be honest.

06:12.884 --> 06:14.587
Oh. Uh, why?
'Cause they hollered at me?

06:14.587 --> 06:16.525
(scoffs) No, look,

06:16.525 --> 06:19.030
those guys are B-holes, but
they got 'em everywhere, right?

06:19.030 --> 06:21.134
I'd even say they were D-holes.

06:21.134 --> 06:22.537
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

06:23.505 --> 06:26.578
Uh, he
re, let me show you
a picture of my best friend.

06:26.578 --> 06:29.317
She's crippled,
but she is so cool. (chuckles)

06:29.317 --> 06:32.223
Yeah. Cool.
Yeah, she is, uh, crippled.

06:32.223 --> 06:34.260
(moaning)

06:38.202 --> 06:40.272
I got a present for you.

06:46.518 --> 06:48.455
You don't like?

06:48.455 --> 06:52.163
Oh, no, it's-it's pretty dope.

06:52.163 --> 06:55.436
(moaning)

06:55.436 --> 06:57.306
No, I mean,
I love Wizard of Oz, too.

06:57.306 --> 06:59.043
It's just kind of hard
to watch now that

06:59.043 --> 07:00.946
we know that Judy Garland
was being sexually assaulted

07:00.946 --> 07:02.350
every day by the Oompa-Loompas.

07:02.350 --> 07:05.389
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Uh, the Munchkins.

07:05.389 --> 07:06.892
- Oh, the Munchkins.
- Yeah.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.195
Yeah, she was molested
by the Munchkins.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.099
I mean, they were
upskirting her, you know?

07:10.099 --> 07:11.601
- Yeah.
- Anyways,

07:11.601 --> 07:15.042
what are your wildest hopes
and dreams in life, Meg?

07:16.545 --> 07:19.050
Well, um...

07:19.050 --> 07:20.653
I love to dance.

07:20.653 --> 07:23.358
- (laughs)
- You want to dance?

07:23.358 --> 07:26.498
(laughs) No, no.
There's-there's no music.

07:26.498 --> 07:29.337
Huh? You said there's no music?

07:29.337 --> 07:31.208
- (laughs)
- Come on.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.978
- Whoo!
- Hey!

07:36.685 --> 07:39.057
Whoa.

07:41.963 --> 07:44.501
♪ ♪

07:47.640 --> 07:49.110
Oh, my God.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.014
- I love that.
- (laughs)

07:51.014 --> 07:53.252
I, like, am in love
with this style of dance.

07:53.252 --> 07:55.422
Yeah, uh... (stammers)
I actually had a-a

07:55.422 --> 07:58.629
TikTok channel
with over 6,000 views.

07:58.629 --> 08:00.432
Oh, send it to me,
I-I'll tweet it.

08:00.432 --> 08:02.637
Oh, um...

08:02.637 --> 08:04.541
My parents made me take it down,

08:04.541 --> 08:06.545
- actually. Yeah.
- Oh, no. Why?

08:06.545 --> 08:09.317
They banned secular dancing.
(chuckles)

08:09.317 --> 08:11.154
They think it's unchristian.

08:11.154 --> 08:15.129
No dancing 'cause of Christian?

08:15.129 --> 08:18.001
But I-I-I'm not gonna be, like,
a professional dancer

08:18.001 --> 08:19.972
or anything anyway, right?
So who cares?

08:19.972 --> 08:21.575
I don't know, I have to object

08:21.575 --> 08:23.412
to that. Like, nowadays
you don't need to be born with,

08:23.412 --> 08:24.982
like, an infinite amount
of talent

08:24.982 --> 08:26.518
to be a professional
at a certain thing.

08:26.518 --> 08:28.188
Like, if you have your own style
and your own pizzazz,

08:28.188 --> 08:30.125
you can really
make anything happen.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.430
That just sucks 'cause I feel
like it should be your choice,

08:32.430 --> 08:34.701
not theirs.

08:35.736 --> 08:37.273
(car door closes)

08:37.273 --> 08:38.709
Shoot, shoot.

08:38.709 --> 08:41.047
What's going on?

08:41.047 --> 08:44.487
I think the bus rat has been
gnawing on my phone.

08:44.487 --> 08:46.057
I was gonna bring a girl
back to the bus,

08:46.057 --> 08:47.460
and I was gonna
bang-bang it out,

08:47.460 --> 08:49.430
and then I just bailed
'cause of the rats.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.168
I was like,
she's gonna see rats.

08:51.168 --> 08:53.138
- And rat shit, you know?
- EMMA: Sure, it was the rats.

08:53.138 --> 08:55.042
MIKE:
That is the reason.
I didn't want her to see rats

08:55.042 --> 08:56.178
- and be grossed out.
- EMMA: How many people
have you...?

08:56.178 --> 08:57.480
- I hook up...
- (gasps) Oh.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.582
- Uh...
- Hi.

08:58.582 --> 09:00.052
- EMMA: Hi.
- MIKE: Uh...

09:00.052 --> 09:01.087
- What in the world?
- MIKE: Hello.

09:01.087 --> 09:02.456
Who are you people?

09:02.456 --> 09:04.327
We're here with
your daughter. Um...

09:04.327 --> 09:06.698
Girl who has the body and the
h-- all the... head of hair.

09:06.698 --> 09:08.435
- She's shorter.
- EMMA: She's...

09:08.435 --> 09:10.773
She has all the hair
on her head. There she is.

09:10.773 --> 09:13.478
Mom, Dad, I thought
y'all were at the fair.

09:13.478 --> 09:16.218
We had to turn around
'cause of the weather.

09:16.218 --> 09:19.157
All of Mother's custards
got spoiled.

09:19.157 --> 09:22.230
Megan Ashley, I know you weren't
alone with a man in this house.

09:22.230 --> 09:24.601
No, no, no. (stammers)
It's not like that.

09:24.601 --> 09:26.204
- No.
- SPENCER: For the life of me,

09:26.204 --> 09:29.644
I do not understand
what is going on here.

09:29.644 --> 09:31.648
So, we're friends with Meg,
and she actually

09:31.648 --> 09:33.185
was just being kind enough

09:33.185 --> 09:35.189
to let us use
the Wi-Fi here on our way

09:35.189 --> 09:37.193
- to...

09:37.193 --> 09:38.629
- Memphis.
- We're headed to Memphis,
and we're just stopping over.

09:38.629 --> 09:40.366
- We'll be out of here soon.
- DAVE: In and out.

09:40.366 --> 09:42.803
- Y'all ain't going nowhere.
- (thunder rumbling)

09:42.803 --> 09:44.607
They closed the roads.

09:46.311 --> 09:48.081
Hurricane.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.619
DAVE:
Oh.

09:50.619 --> 09:52.089
MIKE:
Hmm.

09:53.525 --> 09:55.062
Well...

09:55.062 --> 09:56.364
CINDY:
Don't worry,

09:56.364 --> 09:59.637
y'all can stay here
till it passes.

09:59.637 --> 10:01.274
Ah...

10:01.274 --> 10:03.111
Uh...

10:03.111 --> 10:04.781
Megan Ashley, will you just come
and help your grandmother?

10:04.781 --> 10:05.783
She's drenched.

10:05.783 --> 10:07.386
So, um...

10:07.386 --> 10:08.488
We have to stay...

10:09.524 --> 10:11.528
Richard?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.565
What's that?

10:13.565 --> 10:15.569
Richard.

10:15.569 --> 10:17.406
Oh, no, you're confused.

10:17.406 --> 10:19.811
I'm Michael. Michael.

10:19.811 --> 10:23.185
So, I-I've just been considering
this beautiful offer,

10:23.185 --> 10:25.556
but we have, like,
all the wheel drive.

10:25.556 --> 10:27.293
- Oh, yeah.
- Bus driver's coming.
We're gonna cruise

10:27.293 --> 10:28.562
- through it. We are...
- Vroom. We'll be out.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.099
No.

10:30.099 --> 10:32.270
I wouldn't get caught
in the storm.

10:32.270 --> 10:34.140
Got stuck out there
a few weeks back

10:34.140 --> 10:35.676
with the boys at our meeting.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.680
Wasn't pretty.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.317
- A meeting with the boys?
- Uh...

10:39.317 --> 10:41.388
(laughs) And there's more.

10:41.388 --> 10:43.158
Uh, this is my friend Gata,

10:43.158 --> 10:44.694
short for alligator, and

10:44.694 --> 10:47.700
Vatka, which is not short
for anything.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.437
She's just Trans-Siberian.

10:49.437 --> 10:51.141
Not to be confused

10:51.141 --> 10:52.576
- with transsexual.
- Uh...

10:52.576 --> 10:54.447
- Transgender.
- Eh.

10:54.447 --> 10:57.720
And there is another guy
in another room as well.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.624
- He's tan.
- (thunder rumbling)

11:02.249 --> 11:04.519
Well, can you-- Can't you
just, like, drive through it?

11:06.149 --> 11:07.251
Cliff is stuck at an AmPm.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.620
Dude, why can't we just Uber?

11:08.620 --> 11:10.324
Because, dude,
it's crazy outside.

11:10.324 --> 11:11.526
What are you talking about?

11:11.526 --> 11:13.530
Cliff.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.467
All right, well,
just, just stay safe,

11:15.467 --> 11:17.071
and then we'll
see you soon, huh?

11:17.071 --> 11:19.141
What are you looking at, baby?

11:19.141 --> 11:22.281
Relax, read the room.
It's not time for that.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.619
These people are
insanely conservative.

11:24.619 --> 11:26.422
DAVE:
Yeah, no shit. We're, like,

11:26.422 --> 11:28.493
in the absolute belly of the
beast right now, everybody.

11:28.493 --> 11:30.163
Take note and heed, okay?

11:30.163 --> 11:31.799
There are some
outdated principles

11:31.799 --> 11:33.803
being adhered to
in this household.

11:33.803 --> 11:35.607
Okay, but they're putting us up,
all right?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.344
So, that's a good belief.

11:37.344 --> 11:39.215
And I appreciate that,
but I am thinking about

11:39.215 --> 11:41.286
our dear, sweet Meg, who we've
already put through hell,

11:41.286 --> 11:43.223
mind you, okay?
She's got to deal

11:43.223 --> 11:44.692
- with this whole shit
on a day-to-day level?
- MIKE: Oh.

11:44.692 --> 11:47.131
All she wants to do in life
is dance.

11:47.131 --> 11:49.235
That's what makes her happy.
That's what fills her soul.

11:49.235 --> 11:52.441
And her parents ban it
because it's "unchristian."

11:52.441 --> 11:54.779
Didn't your parents tell you
not to be a rapper, bro?

11:54.779 --> 11:57.251
Not for religious reasons.
Like, that was just because

11:57.251 --> 11:59.188
they were being practical
and logical as far as, like,

11:59.188 --> 12:00.858
planning my future,
and I-I understand, like,

12:00.858 --> 12:02.461
logic and practicality
are Jewish traits,

12:02.461 --> 12:03.797
- though, but...
- MIKE: Very.

12:03.797 --> 12:05.734
You know, I-I-I might just
have a word with

12:05.734 --> 12:07.538
- her parents and...
- Bro, please do not
say anything that

12:07.538 --> 12:09.242
gets us kicked out of this house
during a fucking hurricane.

12:09.242 --> 12:11.412
My mom

12:11.412 --> 12:13.550
says that we cannot
continue to sit back

12:13.550 --> 12:15.787
and let people ruin
the societal fabric

12:15.787 --> 12:18.293
of our country just because
they were "raised differently."

12:18.293 --> 12:19.662
- Like, we're past that point.
- GATA: If anybody

12:19.662 --> 12:21.432
should be uncomfortable,
it should be the Blacks.

12:21.432 --> 12:23.436
I don't like the way
that dude looked at me.

12:23.436 --> 12:26.175
Hey. Jew to Black,
we're in the same boat here.

12:26.175 --> 12:28.848
We're in Mississippi, we're both
kind of, you know, not...

12:28.848 --> 12:30.817
- GATA: Same boat?
You not in the same boat as me.
- What?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.554
Y'all ain't go through
no slavery.

12:32.554 --> 12:34.759
- Have you ever heard
of the Holocaust?
- Oh...

12:34.759 --> 12:36.162
That's not slavery.

12:36.162 --> 12:37.631
It's not slavery?
What do you mean?

12:37.631 --> 12:39.669
They enslaved the Jews
and then starved them

12:39.669 --> 12:40.838
to the point of wither,

12:40.838 --> 12:42.274
- right?
- Mm.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.844
I mean, both things are terrible,

12:43.844 --> 12:45.814
but at least with slavery
the aim was not to exterminate.

12:45.814 --> 12:47.418
The aim was
to keep everybody alive

12:47.418 --> 12:49.288
so output could be,
like, at a max.

12:49.288 --> 12:50.691
- MIKE: Oh, my God.
- Output?
- DAVE: It's true, it's true.

12:50.691 --> 12:52.862
They were producing
bushels of, like, wheat

12:52.862 --> 12:54.699
- and cotton.
- Cotton, you fucking asshole.

12:54.699 --> 12:56.302
Then, like, the whole economy,
the GDP,

12:56.302 --> 12:57.571
everything was on the line.

12:57.571 --> 12:58.874
The Holocaust,
they were just, like,

12:58.874 --> 13:00.377
bringing in the Jews,
thinning them,

13:00.377 --> 13:02.448
and then cutting
their heads off with gas.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.851
MIKE:
Okay, and here we are
being the lazy,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.320
liberal assholes
they think we are.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.723
We should be out there
helping them,

13:06.723 --> 13:07.859
boarding up the windows,
or whatever the fuck

13:07.859 --> 13:09.762
you do, and also,
don't say a word

13:09.762 --> 13:11.399
to her parents about dancing.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.570
Don't.

13:13.570 --> 13:16.175
- Don't.
- This is the last thing I'm
gonna say about the Holocaust.

13:16.175 --> 13:17.444
- (Mike groans)
- Oh, my God...

13:17.444 --> 13:18.446
DAVE:
Back when it was happening,

13:18.446 --> 13:20.450
a lot of people didn't speak up,

13:20.450 --> 13:22.755
and then, when the Nazis
came for those people,

13:22.755 --> 13:25.661
- there was nobody left
to speak up for them.
- (Mike sighs)

13:25.661 --> 13:27.331
- I learned that
in Hebrew school.
- Mm.

13:27.331 --> 13:29.903
I'm not gonna have Meg
be fucked that way.

13:29.903 --> 13:31.406
- Don't be stupid.
- Look, they're not

13:31.406 --> 13:32.942
gonna be able to argue
with the logic

13:32.942 --> 13:34.645
that I'm gonna come with.
No one can argue with logic.

13:34.645 --> 13:36.884
- (loud bang)
- (thunder cracks)

13:36.884 --> 13:38.620
(murmuring)

13:38.620 --> 13:39.789
- We got to get
the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.

13:45.854 --> 13:48.034
Do you wanna make knife
and fork duos with me?

13:48.406 --> 13:52.348
God says I'm foolhardy
and tarnished.

13:52.348 --> 13:54.485
What was that?

13:54.485 --> 13:57.624
He hates me when I weep.

13:57.624 --> 14:00.898
Okay.

14:00.898 --> 14:03.803
- (thunder rumbling)
- Oh.

14:03.803 --> 14:07.711
Dadgum storm
turned right for us.

14:07.711 --> 14:09.715
Aaron needs to take care

14:09.715 --> 14:11.819
of that dead tree that blew
into the shed.

14:11.819 --> 14:13.490
Well, I'll tell him.

14:14.492 --> 14:15.962
(Spencer sighs)

14:17.598 --> 14:19.568
So, you're
a-a musical performer?

14:19.568 --> 14:20.704
That's right.

14:20.704 --> 14:23.309
Is it Christian music?

14:23.309 --> 14:25.313
Uh...

14:25.313 --> 14:27.584
If you count Jewish
as Christian.

14:27.584 --> 14:29.455
Um, which...

14:29.455 --> 14:31.259
I don't know why you would,
unless you were thinking about

14:31.259 --> 14:32.594
how Jesus was Jewish, right?

14:32.594 --> 14:35.400
Uh, but if you
don't think that way, no.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.271
Um, I'm actually a rapper.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.281
But, like, with a totally--
a positive message.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.953
Well, we prefer God's message.

14:47.057 --> 14:48.593
- Yeah? Um...
- CINDY: Mm.

14:48.593 --> 14:49.996
And I hear that fully. Um...

14:49.996 --> 14:52.601
I do think God would totally gel

14:52.601 --> 14:54.538
with my message,
for what it's worth.

14:54.538 --> 14:56.409
You don't have to share
our values

14:56.409 --> 14:57.912
- to share our table.
- Mm.

14:59.582 --> 15:02.421
To play devil's advocate,
not that he needs one,

15:02.421 --> 15:04.458
this is kind of what's wrong
with America, you know?

15:04.458 --> 15:06.629
We don't really know each other.
You don't know my values.

15:06.629 --> 15:08.800
Maybe we have more in common
than you might think.

15:11.372 --> 15:12.741
I am so sorry.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.512
- (chuckles): Okay.
- (chuckles)

15:14.512 --> 15:16.950
Why don't you tell me
what they are?

15:17.952 --> 15:19.555
Uh...

15:20.524 --> 15:22.461
Mom, what are our values?

15:22.461 --> 15:23.864
CAROL (over phone):
Our values?

15:23.864 --> 15:25.500
Yeah, like,
I'm in Mississippi right now,

15:25.500 --> 15:26.970
and I think I'm with
some people that you said

15:26.970 --> 15:28.740
are, like, the bad part
of America.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.446
Oh, God, David, are they armed?

15:31.446 --> 15:33.583
No. Well, I don't know,
probably, but,

15:33.583 --> 15:35.520
like, I mean, I'm trying
to remember what I learned about

15:35.520 --> 15:37.324
nature versus nurture.
It's just, like,

15:37.324 --> 15:39.495
they say they get
their word from Jesus.

15:39.495 --> 15:42.000
- And I don't know what,
like, station this is.
- (thunder rumbles loudly)

15:42.000 --> 15:44.940
God... damn it,
I love you, brother.

15:44.940 --> 15:48.746
I'll see you on the other side
of that mountain.

15:48.746 --> 15:51.752
Talking to, um, my cousin.

15:53.056 --> 15:54.792
I need you.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.964
You need me?

15:56.964 --> 15:59.568
Come on.

16:02.441 --> 16:03.610
(thunder cracks)

16:05.080 --> 16:06.816
You know, no one ever says
"things are going north"

16:06.816 --> 16:08.353
when they're going well.

16:08.353 --> 16:10.023
Only south
when they're going poorly.

16:10.023 --> 16:11.759
In the name of things
going poorly,

16:11.759 --> 16:13.630
I think the little girl
is a demon.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.902
- No.
- Bro, she's a kid.

16:15.902 --> 16:19.041
MIKE:
You know when rappers say
"demon time"? What is that?

16:19.041 --> 16:21.045
EMMA:
I thought it was when people
fuck late-night

16:21.045 --> 16:22.814
and they don't want
to tell anyone about it.

16:22.814 --> 16:25.387
ELZ:
No, that's called
a "sneaky wink."

16:25.387 --> 16:27.691
MIKE:
God, there's so many terms
I just don't understand or know.

16:27.691 --> 16:28.793
EMMA:
Sneak...

16:28.793 --> 16:30.063
- (whispers): Dude.
- What?

16:30.063 --> 16:31.934
- MIKE: I don't know...
- Hey, hey.

16:31.934 --> 16:34.538
- What?
- What?

16:34.538 --> 16:36.509
ELZ:
I can see her pussy.

16:36.509 --> 16:38.713
- MIKE (whispers): Shut up.
- Can't you?

16:38.713 --> 16:40.918
(television playing softly)

16:40.918 --> 16:43.389
Oh. Is that...

16:43.389 --> 16:44.725
Is that her p-- Is that
her puss-- That's her pussy?

16:44.725 --> 16:46.495
- ELZ: That's her pussy.
- What do we do?

16:47.497 --> 16:48.934
Oh. Wait.

16:48.934 --> 16:51.005
Come here, buddy.
What is he doing?

16:51.005 --> 16:52.942
- Now, why would she...?
- He's licking her feet.

16:52.942 --> 16:54.445
(soft lapping)

16:54.445 --> 16:56.515
- Oh...
- My God.

16:58.854 --> 17:00.824
That's disgusting.

17:00.824 --> 17:02.494
Um...

17:02.494 --> 17:04.164
Why can't I st--
I keep looking at it.

17:04.164 --> 17:05.700
- EMMA: Don't look.
- Well...

17:05.700 --> 17:06.970
ELZ:
I can't look.

17:06.970 --> 17:08.606
MIKE:

17:08.606 --> 17:09.575
Let's just go to another room.
Quietly, quietly.

17:09.575 --> 17:10.978
- Okay.
- (shushes)

17:10.978 --> 17:12.982
(chair scrapes)

17:12.982 --> 17:14.986
(shushes)

17:14.986 --> 17:16.689
Oh, my God.

17:16.689 --> 17:18.693
(soft ticking)

17:18.693 --> 17:20.163
(thunder rumbles)

17:20.163 --> 17:22.601
We can't have twigs
and branches flying around,

17:22.601 --> 17:24.471
crashing into the house, can we?

17:24.471 --> 17:27.411
I guess not, no.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.719
Oh, a saw. Cool.

17:31.719 --> 17:35.060
It's like a horror movie
out here.

17:35.060 --> 17:37.130
Did you ever see Saw?

17:37.130 --> 17:40.604
Nah. I hate the playground.

17:40.604 --> 17:43.176
They used to call me Monkey Bar.

17:43.176 --> 17:45.113
They used to call me Bic.

17:45.113 --> 17:48.620
'Cause I used to Bic my dick
with my dad's razor.

17:50.624 --> 17:51.726
I don't know.

17:51.726 --> 17:53.730
What are your intentions
with Meg?

17:53.730 --> 17:56.002
Pure. Christlike.

17:56.002 --> 17:58.039
She's just a fan.

17:58.039 --> 18:01.112
Yeah, and y'all rappers
don't fuck fans, right?

18:02.114 --> 18:04.685
- I mean, s-sometime-- I...
- What?

18:04.685 --> 18:06.923
Is she too fat?

18:06.923 --> 18:08.894
No.

18:08.894 --> 18:10.664
I love fat.

18:12.936 --> 18:14.605
I'm just fucking with you.

18:14.605 --> 18:16.910
- Okay.
- I wouldn't fuck her either.

18:16.910 --> 18:19.481
Well, she's your sister, so...

18:19.481 --> 18:21.619
(engine revs)

18:27.731 --> 18:30.905
- It's a Category 3.
- GATA: Hey, Ryan, man,

18:30.905 --> 18:33.509
congrats on getting
that submarine license, bro.

18:33.509 --> 18:34.980
Let me know how it is
down there,

18:34.980 --> 18:36.716
Finding Nemo and all that.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.121
GD all day. Salute.

18:39.121 --> 18:41.592
Oh, this is a good one.
I used to smoke cigarettes.

18:41.592 --> 18:43.229
Hey, yo, Alan and Christine,

18:43.229 --> 18:45.066
I heard y'all quit
that nicotine.

18:45.066 --> 18:46.903
That's what's up, my G,
GD all day.

18:46.903 --> 18:47.939
- Salute.
- (breathing heavily)

18:49.608 --> 18:52.781
I've seen the devil.

18:52.781 --> 18:55.186
Stared him square in the eyes.

18:55.186 --> 18:57.724
Felt the heat off his face.

18:57.724 --> 18:59.261
- Okay.
- I will protect

18:59.261 --> 19:01.666
this family with my life,

19:01.666 --> 19:04.672
protect Meg, even from herself.

19:04.672 --> 19:06.208
Do you understand me, boy?

19:06.208 --> 19:08.079
I-I think I do. I don't
understand what's happening now.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.216
Are we just cutting this side
of the tree, or...?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.953
GATA:
Got another one?

19:11.953 --> 19:13.723
Hey, Xander, I heard you got
fired on your day off

19:13.723 --> 19:14.959
for stealing cardboard boxes.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.028
- That's what's up, bruh.
- (panting)

19:16.028 --> 19:17.664
Keep doing your thing, G.

19:19.001 --> 19:20.704
You see me now, motherfucker?

19:20.704 --> 19:22.140
- What the fuck, man?
- Hmm?

19:22.140 --> 19:24.211
- Do you see me?
- You tripping.

19:24.211 --> 19:25.814
- No, do you see...
- Calm down!

19:25.814 --> 19:27.852
(speaking Russian)

19:30.657 --> 19:32.227
- (crying)
- Why the fuck you throw
my phone like that, man?

19:32.227 --> 19:33.730
Gata.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.835
Go get her, bro.
What are you doing?

19:35.835 --> 19:38.239
Bro, I'm not chasing
that type of energy, man.

19:38.239 --> 19:40.610
Why do you always do
this shit, Gata?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.280
Do what? I was doing Cameos.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.585
Trying to get some money.

19:44.585 --> 19:47.257
- (crying)
- AARON: "For these enemies
of mine,

19:47.257 --> 19:49.996
"who do not want me
to reign over them,

19:49.996 --> 19:51.599
- bring them here..."
- (chain saw revs)

19:51.599 --> 19:54.571
"...and I shall slaughter them
before you."

19:54.571 --> 19:57.744
- Uh...
- Corinthians 6:14.

19:57.744 --> 20:02.754
"Be ye not unequally yoked
together with unbelievers..."

20:02.754 --> 20:04.691
(mechanical click)

20:07.798 --> 20:09.903
(whispers):
Jesus,

20:09.903 --> 20:11.572
save me.

20:13.242 --> 20:15.981
Okay. I think the power
went out, dude.

20:17.919 --> 20:19.989
Yeah, I think so.

20:24.198 --> 20:26.635
(thunder crashes)

20:27.637 --> 20:29.843
- Let us pray.
- Oh.

20:31.812 --> 20:33.149
(clears throat)

20:33.149 --> 20:34.886
Heavenly Father,

20:34.886 --> 20:36.756
thank you for this nourishment

20:36.756 --> 20:39.628
and shelter
from this mighty storm.

20:39.628 --> 20:40.898
Thank you for this bounty
we are able

20:40.898 --> 20:42.902
to share with our guests.

20:42.902 --> 20:46.675
Please watch over them
and protect them

20:46.675 --> 20:49.047
- on their journey.
- Amen.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.350
- (clears throat)
- (whispers): Not yet.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.220
Blessed Savior,

20:52.220 --> 20:55.193
we ask for your light,
that it may guide our Megan

20:55.193 --> 20:57.865
toward more righteous pursuits.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.236
We see the devil's temptation,

21:00.236 --> 21:03.042
and we know he is here,
at large.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.246
In the name of Christ we pray.

21:05.246 --> 21:06.950
Amen.

21:06.950 --> 21:08.619
ALL:
Amen.

21:10.156 --> 21:12.194
CINDY:
Gata, will your foreign woman

21:12.194 --> 21:14.665
be joining us for supper?

21:14.665 --> 21:16.135
Oh, no, ma'am.

21:16.135 --> 21:17.939
Vatka's all right.
She's not gonna be here tonight.

21:17.939 --> 21:19.241
CINDY:
Well, we can make her
a little plate.

21:19.241 --> 21:21.045
I'd rather not.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.963
You know, one thing I've been
thinking about all day--

21:29.963 --> 21:32.367
and this might be a little
difficult to talk about--

21:32.367 --> 21:36.075
but what is unchristian
about dancing?

21:36.075 --> 21:38.346
MIKE (softly):
Oh, God. Dave, come on.

21:38.346 --> 21:41.418
It's not difficult
to discuss at all, David.

21:41.418 --> 21:45.360
The truth about modern dance
is that it can create lust

21:45.360 --> 21:47.097
and lead to temptation.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.001
- Mm-hmm.
- DAVE: 'Cause of--

21:49.001 --> 21:51.705
y-you mean-- you're thinking
about twerking and stuff?

21:51.705 --> 21:53.376
Richard?

21:54.344 --> 21:56.315
What? Oh. Oh...

21:56.315 --> 21:57.919
Oh, no, it's Michael.

21:57.919 --> 21:59.989
Remember? Michael.
Richard's dead.

21:59.989 --> 22:03.129
I just think it's more or less
how she expresses herself,

22:03.129 --> 22:05.266
and expressing yourself today
might look a little different

22:05.266 --> 22:08.005
than expressing yourself looked
when you were her age, you know?

22:08.005 --> 22:10.911
- Dave...
- The girl filmed herself
doing splits

22:10.911 --> 22:12.915
over a plastic snake head.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.251
Dad.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.855
- Snake head?
- CINDY: Gracelyn, sweetie.

22:15.855 --> 22:17.859
Here. Why don't you take
your plate to your room?

22:17.859 --> 22:19.863
GRACE:
Yes, Ma.

22:19.863 --> 22:21.867
- No, she-- th-the girl...
- Can you chill out?

22:21.867 --> 22:23.436
- DAVE: She doesn't have to...
- (shushing)

22:26.442 --> 22:27.744
Sorry.

22:27.744 --> 22:29.114
MIKE:
Just eat your food.

22:31.185 --> 22:34.458
Well, now that the child's gone,
we can really dive into it, no?

22:34.458 --> 22:36.061
Like, sexuality. Let's just
talk about it real quick.

22:36.061 --> 22:38.799
What is evil about sexuality?

22:38.799 --> 22:40.270
Because for Gen Z,
sexuality, like,

22:40.270 --> 22:42.307
flaunting how you move
and gyrate

22:42.307 --> 22:45.948
is just as commonplace as,
like, combing your hair was

22:45.948 --> 22:47.885
for you back in the '40s
or whatever, you know?

22:47.885 --> 22:49.755
- MEG (laughs): Um...
- It's, like, a different time,

22:49.755 --> 22:52.160
- and we have to...
- Rampant lust leads to emptiness

22:52.160 --> 22:53.897
and desperation.

22:53.897 --> 22:56.836
You become trapped
in a cycle of pleasure,

22:56.836 --> 22:59.107
and you start to lose your soul.

22:59.107 --> 23:01.178
- Mm-hmm.
- Your soul?

23:01.178 --> 23:02.915
EMMA:
Jesus was pretty clear

23:02.915 --> 23:04.484
about not judging sexuality.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.957
I mean, he hung out
with prostitutes.

23:06.957 --> 23:10.196
And that's a Christian woman. Formerly.

23:10.196 --> 23:12.334
Who still might, uh,
prescribe to some...

23:12.334 --> 23:15.173
You know, even my parents,
for example,

23:15.173 --> 23:18.346
used to look at Kim Kardashian
like a DIY porno slut,

23:18.346 --> 23:20.383
but now they're able
to see, "Oh,

23:20.383 --> 23:22.320
"she's gotten
her, like, law degree.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.326
She frees incarcerated Blacks."

23:25.326 --> 23:27.230
It's like, things evolve,
times change,

23:27.230 --> 23:28.934
and I just think, like,
keeping an open mind

23:28.934 --> 23:31.405
to the present day
is pretty essential.

23:31.405 --> 23:35.246
To say that's baloney would be
an insult to cold meats.

23:35.246 --> 23:37.083
(soft laughter)

23:38.052 --> 23:40.223
I know you libtards care
more about criminals

23:40.223 --> 23:41.792
than unborn babies.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.231
Aaron.

23:44.231 --> 23:46.402
You said "libtard"?

23:46.402 --> 23:48.472
'Cause we don't say
"tard" today.

23:48.472 --> 23:50.109
Please don't tell me
what to say in my own home

23:50.109 --> 23:52.480
and I won't tell you
what to say in yours.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.117
I-I'm just saying,
living your whole life

23:54.117 --> 23:55.820
on a philosophy
that's based off of a book

23:55.820 --> 23:57.490
that was written tens
of thousands of years ago,

23:57.490 --> 23:59.494
like, I don't know, we've just
learned way too many facts

23:59.494 --> 24:02.233
since then to still be
adhering to those rules.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.839
And to hold poor, sweet Meg
to those standards,

24:04.839 --> 24:06.141
like, she doesn't even
believe in that.

24:06.141 --> 24:07.377
Hey!

24:07.377 --> 24:09.047
Don't you dare say that.

24:09.047 --> 24:11.385
- Oh.
- And don't talk to my parents
that way.

24:11.385 --> 24:13.890
I'm sorry, Meg,
but no one's gonna defend you,

24:13.890 --> 24:15.326
and I'm trying, and it's just
like, the way that you guys

24:15.326 --> 24:16.997
are living is not necessarily
more righteous

24:16.997 --> 24:18.532
- than the way that we're...
- What?

24:18.532 --> 24:20.003
(knocking on door)

24:20.003 --> 24:21.372
GATA:
Oh, I got it.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.275
Think that's me.

24:23.275 --> 24:24.979
DAVE:
Wh-What?

24:26.015 --> 24:27.317
(door opens)

24:27.317 --> 24:29.154
- Hey, what's up?
- GRACIELA: Hey. How are you?

24:29.154 --> 24:31.258
I can't believe you made it
out here with this weather.

24:31.258 --> 24:33.329
- I know, this shit is crazy.
- GATA: Man, you looking
hella good, too.

24:33.329 --> 24:35.133
Damn. I can't believe
you came like that.

24:35.133 --> 24:37.270
- Is that Vatka?
- Seriously.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.007
- (kissing)
- Man, I'm so happy to see you.

24:39.007 --> 24:40.543
- (Graciela mutters)
- Hey, thank you for the food,

24:40.543 --> 24:43.917
but, um, I got to catch up
with y'all in the morning.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.553
Gata, who is that?

24:45.553 --> 24:47.323
Oh, this is Graciela, you know.
Cliff, he hella pussy.

24:47.323 --> 24:48.927
She got a four-cylinder SUV,

24:48.927 --> 24:50.329
- still came to kick it with me.
- Mm-hmm.

24:50.329 --> 24:52.033
I'm-a be outside in her car
in the front.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.469
That's my dawg. Gata, bro,

24:53.469 --> 24:55.173
he had two bitches pull up
in a hurricane.

24:55.173 --> 24:57.344
What is this fucking bitch?

24:57.344 --> 24:58.880
- What?
- Who the fuck is that?

24:58.880 --> 25:00.416
GATA:
Let's just be cool, yo. Um...

25:00.416 --> 25:03.155
- I put you on my skin.
- Hey, let's just be-- Come on.

25:03.155 --> 25:04.892
- You slut.
- (screams)
- Oh!

25:04.892 --> 25:06.161
- Uh...
- VATKA: Slut.

25:06.161 --> 25:07.430
- Are you fucking...?
- Calm down.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.434
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

25:12.073 --> 25:14.111
- (gasps)
- Prevent it. Prevent it.
Prevent it.

25:14.111 --> 25:15.646
- Elz, do something, Elz.
- ELZ: Bro, what?

25:15.646 --> 25:17.050
- Do something. Anything.
- What am I gonna...?

25:17.050 --> 25:18.319
MIKE:
Help them-- Get her up.

25:18.319 --> 25:21.158
- Get her off the floor.
- (panting)

25:24.164 --> 25:25.466
GRACIELA:
You're defending her?

25:25.466 --> 25:26.936
Really?

25:26.936 --> 25:29.041
- That's-that's great.
- (door opens)

25:29.041 --> 25:30.309
(door closes)

25:32.280 --> 25:34.651
ELZ:
Gata, man, what the fuck, bro?

25:34.651 --> 25:36.255
DAVE:
Meg.

25:36.255 --> 25:38.159
- Meg?
- MEG: Not now, Dave.

25:39.261 --> 25:43.002
I am so sorry about all of that.

25:43.002 --> 25:45.139
MIKE:
What the fuck
are you thinking, Gata?

25:45.139 --> 25:47.110
DAVE:
Yeah, what is your deal, man?
How many girls do you need

25:47.110 --> 25:49.081
to come at one fucking time,
Gata, to another person's house?

25:49.081 --> 25:51.285
This can't happen
over and over again.

25:51.285 --> 25:53.355
- MIKE: You need fucking help.
- Why would you do this?

25:53.355 --> 25:54.357
You're a sex addict.
Get your shit together.

25:54.357 --> 25:56.662
You know what? I am, bro.

25:56.662 --> 25:58.399
What you want me to say?

25:58.399 --> 26:00.136
You don't think I know that
about myself already?

26:00.136 --> 26:02.540
You know how crazy
in the head I am?

26:02.540 --> 26:05.346
I got to text a bitch
every night

26:05.346 --> 26:08.085
just because I can't stand
being alone.

26:08.085 --> 26:10.223
You know how bad that feel?

26:10.223 --> 26:11.558
What y'all want me to do?

26:11.558 --> 26:14.097
- Okay...
- Tell me. You a Christian.

26:14.097 --> 26:16.368
It's okay. Okay?

26:16.368 --> 26:19.241
It's all okay.
Just share your pain.

26:19.241 --> 26:20.643
What you want to know?
You want to know the last time

26:20.643 --> 26:21.678
that I was with a girl?

26:21.678 --> 26:23.115
Committed to her?

26:23.115 --> 26:25.153
She left me and had an abortion.

26:25.153 --> 26:27.657
You know what that shit
did to me?

26:27.657 --> 26:30.029
Broke my fucking heart!

26:38.746 --> 26:42.153
He wants you to love yourself

26:42.153 --> 26:45.193
just as much as He loves you.

26:45.193 --> 26:47.998
He will never abandon you.

26:49.034 --> 26:50.536
Why wouldn't He?

26:50.536 --> 26:53.542
Everybody else did already.

26:53.542 --> 26:57.250
I never knew my mom,
never knew my dad.

26:58.152 --> 27:01.492
How's somebody gonna
tell me what to do?

27:01.492 --> 27:03.596
Gata, what do you mean
you don't know your mom?

27:03.596 --> 27:04.764
I've met your mom. She's...

27:04.764 --> 27:07.470
Nobody met my real mom.

27:07.470 --> 27:09.674
She left me, man.

27:09.674 --> 27:11.678
She chose drugs, man.

27:11.678 --> 27:14.417
(crying):
Like, what y'all want me
to say? Like...

27:14.417 --> 27:17.157
Why should I trust a woman?

27:17.157 --> 27:19.161
Why should I love a woman?

27:19.161 --> 27:22.567
My mom didn't love me
my whole life.

27:22.567 --> 27:24.237
How y'all
gonna tell me something

27:24.237 --> 27:27.510
to make me feel bad,
make me want to change?

27:27.510 --> 27:29.581
Like...
(scoffs)

27:29.581 --> 27:33.055
I was raised
by Michael Jordan, man, like...

27:33.055 --> 27:35.326
The Simpsons, dawg.

27:35.326 --> 27:38.065
Shit like that, bro.

27:38.065 --> 27:42.073
- You know how that feel, dawg?
- CINDY: You are God's son.

27:42.073 --> 27:44.711
Can we pray for you?

27:44.711 --> 27:47.183
Yeah, man.

27:47.183 --> 27:49.187
(softly):
Okay.

27:49.187 --> 27:52.594
Dear Lord,
we pray for our friend,

27:52.594 --> 27:55.266
and ask that You help him

27:55.266 --> 27:58.272
through the struggles
he's facing.

27:58.272 --> 28:01.278
Please let this young man know

28:01.278 --> 28:04.284
that he is worthy of Your love.

28:04.284 --> 28:07.056
- I love you, man.
- Okay.

28:09.261 --> 28:11.098
(crying)

28:11.098 --> 28:14.070
- Hey. Here...
- GATA: Thank you.

28:17.845 --> 28:20.082
DAVE:
Hey, Meg, I'm so sorry about

28:20.082 --> 28:22.620
- all the craziness tonight.
- (phone whooshes)

28:22.620 --> 28:25.092
And I'm really sorry
that we didn't really get

28:25.092 --> 28:27.096
to hang out how we planned to.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.832
I don't know if you want to come
to another show at, like,

28:28.832 --> 28:33.175
a later date,
but I-I would love that.

28:33.175 --> 28:35.813
(phone whooshes)

28:35.813 --> 28:41.124
Most importantly, I am so sorry
for bringing up the dancing.

28:41.124 --> 28:43.829
I was just trying to...

28:43.829 --> 28:46.201
I don't know.

28:46.201 --> 28:48.772
Sorry again.

28:48.772 --> 28:50.276

But, you know, I realize

I-I don't really
know you either.

29:52.567 --> 29:54.337
You do know me. You do.

29:54.337 --> 29:56.608
Like, I am the guy that you love
in the music. I'm that same guy.

29:56.608 --> 29:58.212
I'm not the asshole
that you saw last night.

29:58.212 --> 30:00.182
Oh, no, I-I know you were
just trying to help,

30:00.182 --> 30:02.687
but I don't need you
to save me, Dave.

30:02.687 --> 30:05.159
I'm already saved.

30:05.159 --> 30:07.430
Sure.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.501
I-I'm not religious,
so it's, like, hard for me

30:09.501 --> 30:11.571
to, like, fully,
you know, but...

30:11.571 --> 30:14.377
- Mm.
- Here's what
I'll tell you, is...

30:14.377 --> 30:17.250
only when I started doing,
like, exactly what I love to do

30:17.250 --> 30:22.460
in life did I feel
any semblance of... spirit.

30:22.460 --> 30:25.633
And my parents
were, like, so anti.

30:25.633 --> 30:28.505
They had a whole intervention
saying, "Don't do this, Dave."

30:28.505 --> 30:30.242
Pretty much everybody
in my whole life

30:30.242 --> 30:31.712
was kind of making
assumptions about me

30:31.712 --> 30:33.782
and why I shouldn't go for it.

30:33.782 --> 30:35.586
Oh, wow.

30:35.586 --> 30:37.757
(laughs):
Well...

30:37.757 --> 30:41.598
I'm really happy
you didn't listen to 'em.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.371
Me, too.

30:45.573 --> 30:47.477
Mm.

30:48.278 --> 30:50.649
Um,
I can't give you
a goodbye hug right now

30:50.649 --> 30:52.253
'cause they're all
still watching.

30:52.253 --> 30:54.357
- Oh. Okay.
- But, um...

30:54.357 --> 30:56.361
I'm gonna give you
a mind hug, okay?

30:56.361 --> 30:58.232
A mind hug?

30:58.232 --> 31:00.503
- Oh.
- Mm.

31:00.503 --> 31:01.873
- Aw.
- Do you feel it?

31:01.873 --> 31:03.509
- (laughs softly)
- Yeah, I do feel it.

31:03.509 --> 31:06.348
It's very warm.

31:06.348 --> 31:08.519

- Yeah.

Bye, Meg.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.588

- Oh.

31:26.588 --> 31:29.294
Sorry. Um...
(clears throat)

31:29.294 --> 31:31.565
I just wanted to say that, um,

31:31.565 --> 31:33.435
I listened to some
of your music,

31:33.435 --> 31:37.410
and I don't normally like rap,
but I loved your shit.

31:37.410 --> 31:39.581
(exhales)
Cool, man. Thank you.

31:39.581 --> 31:41.585
Yeah. It's just fucking cool

31:41.585 --> 31:44.457
to hear someone
who's proud to be white.

31:44.457 --> 31:46.394
You know?

31:46.394 --> 31:48.867
- Uh...
- Like that song "White Guy."

31:48.867 --> 31:50.937
That song slaps, dude.

31:50.937 --> 31:52.975
(chuckles)
Well...

31:52.975 --> 31:54.979
You know, I think
you might be misinterpreting,

31:54.979 --> 31:56.348
like, the premise of the song.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.817
It's kind of, uh...

31:57.817 --> 31:59.821
Nah, nah, nah.
I get it, I get it, I get it.

31:59.821 --> 32:01.691
Just know that me and the boys
are gonna be bumping it

32:01.691 --> 32:02.995
all summer.

32:02.995 --> 32:06.468
Anyway... stay blessed, brother.
