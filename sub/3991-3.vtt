00:01.500 --> 00:03.468
Previously in Hannibal...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.058
- Can you tell me what that
man is doing over there?

00:05.100 --> 00:08.194
- He's some kind of special
consultant for the FBI.
- I asked you to get close

00:08.240 --> 00:11.459
to the Hobbs thing. I need to
know you didn't get too close.

00:11.510 --> 00:14.638
- What you need is
a way out of dark places
when Jack sends you there.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.376
- Last time he sent me
Into a dark place,

00:17.410 --> 00:19.617
I brought something back.
- A surrogate daughter?

00:19.650 --> 00:22.687
- Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?
- She would make the ideal bait.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.110
Wouldn't she?
- Just a second. Dad?

00:26.160 --> 00:29.323
It's for you.
- Hello?

00:29.360 --> 00:31.487
- They know.

01:05.490 --> 01:07.822
- Be patient.
Wait for your shot.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.306
(gunshot)

01:32.460 --> 01:35.315
(soft thud)

01:50.370 --> 01:52.577
Ready? And three, two, one.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.737
Go.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.348
- She was so pretty.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.519
- She IS so pretty.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.518
- Aren't deer are supposed to be

02:03.550 --> 02:07.213
complex emotional creatures?
- Yeah.

02:07.260 --> 02:12.288
- I read they're
like the equivalent
of a four-year-old human being.

02:12.330 --> 02:14.321
- They're smarter
than a four-year-old.

02:16.330 --> 02:19.367
- And they care
about each other.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.937
They care
about their environment.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.938
They tread lightly
through the underbrush

02:23.970 --> 02:27.235
because they don't want
to hurt the plants.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.373
- They're a lot like us.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.538
And we're gonna honor
every part of her.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.617
Her hide is gonna
make a beautiful rug.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.483
Her leg bones we can
carve into knives.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.455
None of her is gonna
go to waste.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.593
Just like we talked about.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.769
Start at the sternum.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.768
Keep the blade pointed up.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.507
Damage the organs,
you ruin the meat.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.647
- I don't know how I'm gonna
feel about eating her
after all this.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.588
- Eating her is honoring her.

03:14.620 --> 03:18.920
Otherwise,
it's... it's just...

03:18.960 --> 03:21.895
murder.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.230
OK.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.830
Nice and easy.
Big breath.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.319
Good.

04:03.570 --> 04:06.471
(monitors beeping)

04:10.010 --> 04:13.411
(muffled whimpering
and coughing)

04:43.610 --> 04:46.613
(dog barking)

04:48.350 --> 04:50.341
- Morning.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.350
- Didn't hear you drive up.
- Hybrid.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.518
Great car for stalking.
- Um,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.551
I'm compelled
to go cover myself.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.568
- I have brothers.
- Well, I'll put a robe on

05:02.600 --> 05:04.568
just the same.
You want a cup of coffee?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.568
And more immediately,
why are you here?

05:06.600 --> 05:09.535
- Yes, and Abigail Hobbs
woke up.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.007
- Well, you know how
to bury the lede.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.349
- You want me to get you
a cup of coffee?

05:17.380 --> 05:18.870
- No. I want to get my coat.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.470
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.919
(ringing)

05:29.430 --> 05:31.682
(cell phone vibrating)

05:35.100 --> 05:37.068
- Is he gonna keep calling?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.068
- Jack wants you
to go see her.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.398
- And you don't.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.998
- Eventually.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.008
Jack thinks Abigail was

05:45.040 --> 05:47.508
an accomplice
to her father's crimes.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.475
I don't want to get
in the middle of you and Jack,

05:50.510 --> 05:53.547
but ifI can be helpful
to you as a buffer--

05:53.580 --> 05:55.741
- I--I like you as a buffer.

05:55.780 --> 05:59.955
I also like the fact
that you rattle Jack.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.481
He respects you far too much
to yell at you,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.623
no matter how much
he wants to.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.696
- And I take advantage
of that.

06:10.770 --> 06:14.536
- Abigail Hobbs
doesn't have anyone.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.831
- You can't be
her everyone.

06:22.110 --> 06:24.772
When I said what I was going
to say in my head,

06:24.810 --> 06:26.812
it sounded really insulting,
so I'm going to find

06:26.850 --> 06:30.547
another way to say it.
- Say it the insulting way.

06:32.990 --> 06:35.879
- Dogs keep a promise
a person can't.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.993
- I'm not collecting
another stray.

06:40.030 --> 06:43.466
- The first person Abigail
talks to about what happened

06:43.500 --> 06:45.991
can't be anyone who
was there when it happened.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.964
So that means
no Dr. Lecter either.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.834
- Yeah, much less the guy
who killed Dad.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.031
Jack's wrong
about Abigail.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.072
- Let me reach out to her
my own way.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.924
Hi.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.598
I'm Alana Bloom.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.858
- Are you a doctor?

07:21.900 --> 07:25.165
- Not medicine.
I'm a psychiatrist.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.435
- What do you specialize in?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.616
- Among other things,

07:33.650 --> 07:35.641
family trauma.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.883
_ - I asked the nurses
If my parents were dead,

07:40.920 --> 07:42.922
and they wouldn't tell me.

07:44.930 --> 07:48.093
Said I had to wait for you.

07:48.130 --> 07:50.564
- I'm sorry
you had to wait.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.061
- I know they're dead.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.901
Who buried them?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.202
- They haven't been buried.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.674
- Don't you think
they should be?

08:08.720 --> 08:12.110
- Your mother was cremated
per the Instructions
in her living will.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.827
(She clears her throat.)
- My dad?

08:19.930 --> 08:22.524
- Your father is
more complicated.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.935
- Because he was crazy?

08:26.970 --> 08:30.167
- The nurses said
you didn't remember.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.134
- I remember. I just didn't want
to talk to them about it.

08:36.910 --> 08:38.673
I want to sell the house.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.678
I guess it's mine now.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.881
I can use the money for college,
get an apartment.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.984
What are all those?

08:48.020 --> 08:50.659
- I brought you some clothes.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.794
Thought a change might
feel good.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.923
I guessed your size,
so anything you don't want,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.997
leave the tags on,
I'll bring it back.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.964
And I brought you
some music too.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.037
- Your music?
- If _there isn't
anything you like,

09:03.070 --> 09:05.800
I've got a stack
of iTunes gift cards.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.808
I--I've got a stack
of gift cards.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.535
I don't... do well
redeeming gift cards.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.648
- Probably says something
about you.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.079
- Probably does.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.698
- I got seven families waiting.

09:26.730 --> 09:30.666
No, let me rephrase: demanding
that we find whatever's left
of their daughters.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.998
Abigail Hobbs may be the only
person who knows the truth.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.895
- You can't ask her
right now, Jack.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.363
We have to create a safe place
for her first

09:38.410 --> 09:41.629
or you won't get any answers.
- I respect your sympathy

09:41.680 --> 09:45.207
for her, Dr. Bloom.
I hope one day you'll
appreciate my lack of it.

09:45.250 --> 09:48.879
- You really think Abigail Hobbs
helped her father kill
those girls?

09:48.920 --> 09:51.184
- I think it's a possibility
that needs to be ruled out.

09:51.220 --> 09:53.984
If Abigail didn't help her
father, maybe she knows who did.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.956
- How was she
when you saw her?

09:57.990 --> 10:00.026
- Surprisingly practical.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.722
- Suspiciously practical?
- I would suggest

10:02.770 --> 10:04.726
she can be practical
without being a murderer.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.091
- I think she's
hiding something.

10:07.140 --> 10:11.133
- It may simply be her trauma.
- Yeah, it could also be more.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.172
She has a penchant
for manipulation;

10:13.210 --> 10:15.678
withheld information
to gain Information;

10:15.710 --> 10:18.042
she demonstrated only
enough emotions

10:18.080 --> 10:20.947
to prove she had them.
- You're beginning to appreciate
my lack of sympathy?

10:20.980 --> 10:24.108
- You said it may be more
than trauma, yet you question

10:24.150 --> 10:26.414
her involvement in the murders
her father committed?

10:26.450 --> 10:29.988
- What I'm questioning
is her state of mind.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.693
- I want Will Graham
to talk to her.

10:33.730 --> 10:36.096
- Jack. Not yet.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.292
- You are not Will Graham's
psychiatrist, Dr. Bloom.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.002
Dr. Lecter is.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.338
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs--

10:46.370 --> 10:51.171
the, uh, Minnesota Shrike,
abducted and murdered

10:51.210 --> 10:55.977
eight girls
over an eight-month period.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.818
Each of them had the same
hair color, same eye color,

10:58.850 --> 11:01.057
same age, same height,
same weight

11:01.090 --> 11:04.025
as his daughter Abigail.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.790
There was a ninth victim

11:06.830 --> 11:08.991
who also fit
Abigail Hobbs's profile,

11:09.030 --> 11:12.227
but Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't murder her.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.206
The killer who did
wanted us to know

11:17.240 --> 11:19.663
he wasn't the Minnesota Shrike.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.301
He was better
than that.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.910
He is an intelligent psychopath.
He is a sadist.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.111
He will never kill
like this again.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.879
So how do we catch him?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.353
- Giving a lecture
on Hobbs's copycat?

11:39.390 --> 11:42.359
- Well, we need every good mind
we can get on this.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.166
- This copycat is
an avid reader

11:46.200 --> 11:49.363
of Freddie Lounds
and Tattlecrime.com.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.029
He had intimate knowledge

11:53.080 --> 11:56.379
of Garrett Jacob Hobbs's
murders, motives, patterns--

11:56.410 --> 11:58.970
enough to recreate them
and, arguably,

11:59.010 --> 12:02.218
elevate them to art.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.048
How intimately did he know
Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

12:05.090 --> 12:07.058
Did he appreciate him

12:07.090 --> 12:10.025
from afar, or did he engage him?

12:10.060 --> 12:13.791
Did he ingratiate himself
into Hobbs's life?

12:13.830 --> 12:16.492
Did Hobbs know
his copycat

12:16.530 --> 12:18.327
as he was known?

12:22.400 --> 12:25.005
Before Garrett Jacob Hobbs
murdered his wife

12:25.040 --> 12:27.531
and attempted to do
the same to his daughter,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.174
he received an untraceable call.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.371
I believe

12:32.410 --> 12:35.470
the as-yet
unidentified caller

12:35.520 --> 12:39.081
was our copycat killer.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.524
- So you're not a doctor,

12:50.570 --> 12:53.437
a nurse, or a psychiatrist.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.438
- I'm a journalist.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.802
I want to tell the truth.
Your truth.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.479
Sometimes that involves
some deception,

13:00.510 --> 13:02.478
but know this:
I will never lie to you.

13:02.510 --> 13:05.001
- Sounds like something
a liar would say.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.211
- If you tell me what you know,

13:07.250 --> 13:09.218
I can help you
fill in the blanks.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.344
- How about you tell me
what you know.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.056
- Your dad was
the Minnesota Shrike.

13:17.090 --> 13:20.127
Your mother wasn't the first
person your father killed.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.321
He killed
eight girls.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.319
Eight girls that looked--
- Just like me.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.338
- Yes.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.338
- Why do they call him
the Shrike?

13:30.370 --> 13:33.339
- It's a bird that
impales its prey,

13:33.380 --> 13:37.407
harvests the organs
to eat later.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.918
He was very sick.

13:39.950 --> 13:44.216
- Does that mean I'm sick too?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.117
- You'll be fighting
that perception.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.482
Perception is
the most important thing

13:50.530 --> 13:53.158
in your life right now.
- I don't care what
anybody thinks.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.327
- You'd better
start caring, Abigail.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.567
What you remember,
what you tell everyone,

13:57.600 --> 13:59.568
is going to define
the rest of your life.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.296
Let me help you.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.835
- How did they catch him?

14:11.950 --> 14:15.545
- A man named Will Graham.
Works for the FBI but isn't FBI.

14:15.580 --> 14:19.448
He catches insane men
because he can think like them.

14:19.490 --> 14:23.028
Because he is insane.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.525
- Would you excuse us, please?

14:30.200 --> 14:33.897
I'm Special Agent Will Graham.
- By Special Agent he means
not really an agent.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.896
He didn't get past
the screening process.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.101
Too unstable.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.578
- I really must insist
you leave the room.
- If you want to talk--

14:51.520 --> 14:55.354
- Abigail,

14:55.390 --> 14:59.281
this is Dr. Lecter.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.298
Do you remember us?

15:01.330 --> 15:04.527
- I remember you.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.590
You killed my dad.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.508
- You've been in bed
for days, Abigail.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.543
Why don't we
have a walk?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.983
- I'm sorry we couldn't
save your mother.

15:25.020 --> 15:29.218
We did everything we could
but she was already gone.
- I know.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.956
I saw him kill her.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.733
He was loving right up
until the second he wasn't.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.500
Kept telling me
he was sorry,

15:43.540 --> 15:47.306
to just hold still.

15:47.340 --> 15:51.344
He was gonna
make it all go away.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.511
but there's nothing
wrong with you.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.080
You say he was loving.
I believe it.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.418
That's what you
brought out in him.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.156
- It's not all _
I brought out in him.

16:07.460 --> 16:11.066
I'm gonna be messed up.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.695
Aren't I?

16:14.740 --> 16:17.061
I'm worried about nightmares.

16:17.110 --> 16:21.331
- We'll help you
with the nightmares.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.440
- There's no such thing

16:24.480 --> 16:28.348
as getting used
to what you experienced.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.781
It bothers me
a lot.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.459
I worry about nightmares too.

16:36.460 --> 16:40.055
- So killing somebody,

16:40.100 --> 16:43.228
even if you have to do it,

16:43.270 --> 16:45.261
it feels that bad?

16:51.770 --> 16:54.773
- It's the ugliest thing
in the world.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.541
- I wanna go home.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.586
- Special Agent Graham.

17:08.620 --> 17:11.123
I never formally
introduced myself.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.527
I'm Freddie Lounds.
- Are you trying to salvage this
joke from the mouth of madness?

17:14.560 --> 17:17.768
- Please. Let me apologize
for my behavior in there.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.768
It was sloppy and misguided

17:19.800 --> 17:22.098
and hurtful.
- Miss Lounds.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.131
Now is not the time.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.734
- Look, you and I may have
our own reasons for being here,

17:28.780 --> 17:32.648
but I also think we both
genuinely care about
what happens

17:32.680 --> 17:35.478
to Abigail Hobbs.
- You told her I was insane.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.546
- I can undo that.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.779
- You help Abigail see me as
more than her father's killer,

17:43.830 --> 17:46.549
and I help you

17:46.590 --> 17:50.492
with online ad sales?
- I can undo what I said.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.794
I can also make it a lot worse.

17:52.830 --> 17:55.799
- Miss Lounds...

17:55.840 --> 17:59.867
it's not very smart
to piss off a guy

17:59.910 --> 18:03.676
who thinks about
killing people for a living.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.679
- "It isn't very smart
to piss off a guy

18:06.710 --> 18:09.508
who thinks about killing
people for a living."

18:11.520 --> 18:14.284
You know what else
isn't very smart?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.288
You were there with him.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.221
And you let those words
come out of his mouth.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.297
- I trust Will to speak
for himself.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.298
- Evidently
you shouldn't.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.890
- I'm just happy the story
wasn't about Abigail Hobbs.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.795
- Well, then it's a victory.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.298
(sighing)
So, Abigail Hobbs

18:32.340 --> 18:34.900
wants to go home.
Let's take her home.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.477
- What Abigail wants
and what she needs

18:37.510 --> 18:41.219
are different things.
Taking her out of a controlled
environment would be reckless.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.787
- You said she was practical.
- That could just mean

18:43.820 --> 18:46.141
she has a dissociative disorder.
- You take her home,

18:46.190 --> 18:49.557
she may experience intense
emotions, respond aggressively,

18:49.590 --> 18:52.923
or re-enact some aspect
of the traumatic event
Without even reali2ing it.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.689
- Where do you weigh in
on this, Doctor?

18:54.730 --> 18:57.198
- Dr. Bloom is right.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.765
But there is a scenario where
reVI5iting the trauma event
could help Abigail heal

19:02.800 --> 19:06.907
and actually
prevent denial.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.170
- Then we have a difference
of opinion. Therefore,

19:09.210 --> 19:11.906
I am going to choose
the opinion

19:11.950 --> 19:13.815
that best serves
my agenda.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.772
I need to know

19:15.820 --> 19:19.779
if you're right about
the copycat, Will.
- We have no way

19:19.820 --> 19:22.459
of knowing what's waiting
for her when she goes home.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.951
- Thanks again
for meeting with me.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.969
I know this hasn't
been easy for you.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.230
- Oh yeah? How
would you know?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.606
I've spoken to the relatives
of some of his other victims.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.733
- Hobbs is dead.

19:42.780 --> 19:45.374
He deserved a lot worse.
Him and his whole family.

19:45.410 --> 19:49.414
- There must be some
small comfort knowmg

19:49.450 --> 19:52.647
that justice was served.

19:55.990 --> 19:59.881
My sister was impaled
on a severed stag head,
cut down the middle.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.455
He pulled out her lungs
while she was still breathing.

20:02.500 --> 20:06.664
There's no comfort in that.
- I'm sorry. I am.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.635
But you have to try not
to remember her that way.

20:11.870 --> 20:14.338
- What do you
want from me?

20:16.810 --> 20:18.778
- I just thought
you should know Abigail Hobbs

20:18.810 --> 20:21.347
came out of her coma.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.058
- Is this where my mom died?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.989
- Yes.

21:13.900 --> 21:19.759
- I was sort of expecting a body
outline in chalk or tape.
- They only do that

21:19.810 --> 21:22.074
if you're still alive

21:22.110 --> 21:25.944
and taken to the hospital before
they finish the crime scene.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.848
- Goodbye, Mom.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.818
- If you ever wanna go,

22:05.850 --> 22:08.683
you just have to say so
and we'll go.
- Go where?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.859
The hospital?

22:10.890 --> 22:13.723
- For now.

22:19.830 --> 22:22.139
- Who turned all
the pictures around?

22:22.170 --> 22:26.561
- Crime_ scene cleaners
Will do that.

22:26.610 --> 22:30.398
- They did a really good job.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.339
Is that where all my blood was?

22:35.850 --> 22:37.818
- Yes.

22:37.850 --> 22:41.115
- You do this a lot?

22:41.160 --> 22:44.618
Go places and think
about killing?

22:47.130 --> 22:49.849
- Too often.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.164
- So you pretended to be my dad.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.089
- And people

22:55.140 --> 22:57.096
like your dad.

22:57.140 --> 23:00.598
- What did it feel like?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.631
To be him?

23:05.080 --> 23:07.548
- It feels... like...

23:07.580 --> 23:10.845
I'm talking to his shadow
suspended on dust.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.951
- No wonder you have nightmares.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.159
- The attacks on you
and your mother

23:22.200 --> 23:24.498
were different.
They were desperate.

23:24.530 --> 23:27.761
Your dad knew he was
out of time. Somebody

23:27.800 --> 23:31.429
told him we were coming.
- The man on the phone?

23:31.470 --> 23:34.439
_ - It was a blocked call.
Did you recognize his v0ice?

23:34.480 --> 23:36.732
- I had never heard it before.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.999
- Was there anybody new
in your father's life?

23:40.050 --> 23:41.972
Someone you met or
someone he talked about?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.088
- Abigail, he may
have been contacted

23:46.120 --> 23:48.509
by another killer.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.529
A copycat.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.551
- Someone who's still out there?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.160
- Yeah.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.908
- Can you catch
somebody who's crazy?

24:05.940 --> 24:08.500
- Folie deux.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.201
- What?

24:10.240 --> 24:13.004
- It's_ a French
psychiatric term.

24:13.050 --> 24:16.872
Madness
shared by two.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.979
- See?

24:19.020 --> 24:21.818
- One cannot be delusional

24:21.860 --> 24:23.885
if the belief in question is
accepted as ordinary

24:23.930 --> 24:26.819
by others in that person's
culture or subculture.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.259
Or family.

24:28.300 --> 24:32.566
- My dad didn't seem delusional.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.591
He was a perfectionist.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.507
- Your dad left
hardly any evidence.

24:39.540 --> 24:42.100
- Is that why
you let me come home?

24:42.140 --> 24:43.698
To find evidence?

24:43.750 --> 24:47.140
- It was one of many
considerations.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.842
- Are we gonna
re-enact the crime?

24:49.880 --> 24:52.587
You be my dad, you be my mom,

24:52.620 --> 24:56.681
and you be the man
on the phone.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.688
- Abigail, we wanted you
to come home

24:58.730 --> 25:00.789
to help you leave
home behind.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.525
- You're not gonna find
any of those girls, you know.

25:06.570 --> 25:10.529
- What makes you say that?
- He would honor every part
of them.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.800
He used to make

25:12.840 --> 25:15.877
plumbing putty
out of elk's bones.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.140
Whatever bones
are left

25:18.180 --> 25:22.310
of those girls are probably
holding pipes together.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.079
- Where did he make this putty?

25:24.120 --> 25:26.213
- At the cabin.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.218
I can show you tomorrow.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.512
- Abigail, there's
someone here.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.591
- Hey, Abigail.

25:40.030 --> 25:42.590
So, uh, does that hurt?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.699
- Sometimes.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.999
- Everybody on the block
was on the news.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.838
And everyone at school.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.314
Such whores.

25:54.350 --> 25:58.241
- Did you talk to the news?
- No. No!

25:58.290 --> 26:02.078
My mom doesn't want me talking
to you, much less the news.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.918
- Since when do you
listen to her?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.155
- Well, clearly I don't.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.294
I'm talking to you right now.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.235
Everybody thinks
you did it, you know?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.961
- Do you think I did it?

26:19.010 --> 26:22.332
- I don't think
you're the type.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.769
Then again, I didn't
think your father

26:24.810 --> 26:27.847
was the murder-suicide type.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.714
Although I guess the hunting
could have been a clue.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.718
- Mine or his?

26:33.760 --> 26:36.217
- Both, now that
you mention it.

26:36.260 --> 26:39.752
I don't think
you did it.

26:39.790 --> 26:42.350
-Ido.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.722
- This is private property.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.398
- You were the bait, right?

26:48.440 --> 26:52.206
That's how it worked? You lure
them back to Daddy for dinner?

26:52.240 --> 26:54.276
How'd you trap
my sister?

26:54.310 --> 26:57.199
Did you chat her up?
- Hey! Piss off!

26:59.210 --> 27:01.770
- Did you help your old man
cut out my sister's lungs

27:01.820 --> 27:04.641
while she was still using--

27:09.020 --> 27:12.080
(spitting)

27:12.130 --> 27:15.224
- He said he was
somebody's brother.

27:15.260 --> 27:18.969
- Marissa! Come home.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.763
- No...
- Come home!

27:20.800 --> 27:25.408
- Can you stop being
such a bitch?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.829
See you later.
- Bye.

27:38.220 --> 27:41.314
- He's gone.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.852
You've never
seen him before?

27:46.890 --> 27:48.926
- No.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.361
- Let's get back to the hotel.
We'll go to the cabin tomorrow.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.039
- We should
report this, yes?

27:55.070 --> 27:56.992
- Yes.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.949
I'm sorry, okay?

28:14.990 --> 28:16.981
This will all stop.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.056
Please. I'm gonna
make it all go away.

28:23.970 --> 28:28.293
(alarm beeping)

29:16.550 --> 29:20.213
- He cleaned everything.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.912
He said he was
afraid of germs,

29:22.960 --> 29:26.521
but I guess he was just afraid
of getting caught.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.018
- No one_else ever came
here With your dad...

29:30.060 --> 29:33.097
except you.

29:33.130 --> 29:36.793
- He made everything
by himself.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.469
Glue, butter...

29:40.510 --> 29:44.002
He sold the pelts
on Ebay or in town.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.042
He made pillows.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.412
No parts went to waste.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.816
Otherwise it was murder.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.297
He was feeding them to us.

30:02.330 --> 30:04.423
Wasn't he?

30:04.470 --> 30:07.997
- It's very likely.

30:10.870 --> 30:14.169
- Before
he cut my throat,

30:14.210 --> 30:18.078
he told me he killed those girls
so he wouldn't have to kill me.

30:18.110 --> 30:22.046
- You're not responsible for
anything your father did,
Abigail.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.514
- If he would've just killed me,

30:24.550 --> 30:27.348
none of those other girls
would be dead.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.278
- We don't know that.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.322
Your father--

30:53.180 --> 30:55.171
- I need ERT at the Hobbs cabin.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.279
- Abigail--
(screaming)

31:26.050 --> 31:29.679
- Do you think she knew the guy
down by the stream?
- Somebody's brother.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.688
- Not somebody.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.211
Abigail said he asked
if she helped her dad

31:34.260 --> 31:36.683
take his sister's lungs
While she was alive.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.086
- The young woman
on the stag head.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.291
- Cassie Boyle.

31:41.330 --> 31:44.163
Had a brother,
Nicholas.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.260
But Garrett Jacob Hobbs
didn't kill

31:47.300 --> 31:49.461
Cassie Boyle.
- I know.

31:51.470 --> 31:54.109
Garrett Jacob Hobbs would've
honored every part of her.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.700
- You brought Abigail Hobbs

31:56.740 --> 31:59.277
back to Minnesota to find out
if she was involved

31:59.310 --> 32:02.074
in her father's murders,
and another girl dies.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.248
- Yep, scraped
his knuckle on her teeth.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.679
There's foreign tissue
and what could be

32:07.720 --> 32:11.383
trace amounts of blood.
- You said that this copycat

32:11.430 --> 32:15.025
was an intelligent psychopath,
Will. That there would be
no traceable motive,

32:15.060 --> 32:17.961
no pattern. He wouldn't
kill again this way.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.161
You said it.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.089
- I may have been
wrong about that.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.098
Why would the copycat do it?
- I think he was provoked.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.301
Nicholas Boyle

32:31.350 --> 32:34.012
murdered this girl
and his own sister.

32:34.050 --> 32:38.384
- With or Without Abigail Hobbs?
- Without.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.615
- Well, do you think
that Abigail Hobbs

32:40.650 --> 32:43.050
knew Nicholas or Cassie Boyle?

32:43.090 --> 32:45.149
- No...

32:47.160 --> 32:49.219
- You don't think
she knew them...

32:49.260 --> 32:51.763
or don't want to think
that she knew them?

32:51.800 --> 32:55.031
- She said she didn't know them.

32:55.070 --> 32:57.538
(Jack sighs.)
- Dr. Bloom says that Abigail

32:57.570 --> 32:59.538
has a penchant for, uh,

32:59.570 --> 33:01.709
manipulation. Is she
manipulating you, Will?

33:01.740 --> 33:03.503
- Agent Crawford.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.474
- Look, he said he was wrong
about the copycat killer.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.705
I want to know What else
he's wrong about.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.718
- Whoever killed the girl
on the field killed this girl,

33:09.750 --> 33:12.241
I'm right about that.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.758
He knew exactly how
to mount the body.

33:14.790 --> 33:18.123
Wound patterns are almost
identical to Cassie Boyle.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.425
Same design, the same...

33:21.460 --> 33:23.724
humiliation.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.762
- Abigail Hobbs
is not a killer.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.292
But she could be
the target of one.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.337
- I think it's time that Abigail
Hobbs left home permanently.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.473
Doctor, would you be good
enough to collect Abigail

33:37.510 --> 33:39.478
and all of her belongings

33:39.510 --> 33:41.671
and escort her out
of Minnesota, please?

33:48.090 --> 33:51.184
Not you, Will.
I want you here.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.420
- (journalists):
Abigail! Abigail!

34:14.850 --> 34:18.718
- You killed my daughter!
- Abigail--

34:18.750 --> 34:20.615
- Why did you come back here?

34:20.650 --> 34:24.586
Why come back?
- Stay here. Stay here.

34:24.630 --> 34:28.350
(woman sobbing)

34:42.380 --> 34:44.348
- Abigail.

34:44.380 --> 34:47.406
- Miss Lounds.

34:47.450 --> 34:49.577
You're on the wrong side
of the police line.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.612
- I've been covering
the Minnesota Shrike long
before you got involved.

34:52.650 --> 34:55.778
I wanna help you tell
your story. You need me
now more than ever.

34:55.820 --> 34:59.278
- I wanna talk to her.
- No you don't. Go inside.

34:59.330 --> 35:02.197
- I'm not the only one lurking
about _the _Hobbs house
peeking in Windows.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.324
You really should monitor those
police lines more carefully.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.733
- Have you seen
a young man, mid-20$,

35:10.770 --> 35:13.807
ginger hair? Unwashed.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.899
- I'll tell you if I saw him

35:15.940 --> 35:18.579
if you tell me
Why it's important.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.252
(sobbing softly)

35:42.200 --> 35:45.203
_ - None of her
is gonna go to waste.

35:57.820 --> 36:01.449
(whimpering)

36:08.560 --> 36:11.290
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.867
Okay? I just need you
to listen to me.

36:15.870 --> 36:18.703
I didn't kill
that girl, okay?

36:18.740 --> 36:20.332
I didn't kill her!

36:20.370 --> 36:21.371
Wait!

36:23.440 --> 36:25.408
Listen! I didn't--

36:45.000 --> 36:47.264
- Abigail?

36:52.640 --> 36:53.629
Abigail?

36:59.010 --> 37:00.807
- She'll be all right.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.915
Abigail.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.986
Show me what happened.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.508
- He was gonna kill me.
- Was he?

37:44.360 --> 37:47.659
This isn't self-defense,
Abigail. You butchered him.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.954
- I didn't...

37:52.330 --> 37:54.491
- They will see
What you did

37:54.540 --> 37:55.939
and they will see you

37:55.970 --> 37:58.609
as an accessory
to the crimes of your father.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.532
- I wasn't.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.318
- I can help you,

38:10.350 --> 38:12.989
if you ask me to.

38:13.020 --> 38:16.854
At great risk to
my career and my life.

38:20.130 --> 38:22.098
You have a choice.

38:22.130 --> 38:25.429
You can tell_ them
you were defending yourself

38:25.470 --> 38:29.338
when you gutted this man...

38:29.370 --> 38:31.702
or we can hide the body.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.419
- Then I don't
remember anything.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.588
Maybe a blur out of the corner
of my eye and--

38:53.630 --> 38:57.418
and then a big fat cut to black.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.964
- Well, Nicholas Boyle
attacked Abigail, you,

39:01.000 --> 39:05.107
struck Dr. Lecter
in the back of the head.

39:05.140 --> 39:08.439
- Well, Where's Abigail?
- Lecter took her back
to the hotel.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.869
- She scratched Nicholas Boyle
on his way out the back door.

39:10.910 --> 39:14.107
The blood on her hands matches
the tissue that we pulled

39:14.150 --> 39:16.072
from Marissa Schurr's mouth.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.749
- And then what, he--
he got away?

39:19.790 --> 39:21.781
- We'll catch him
one way or another.

39:24.590 --> 39:26.626
Where you going?

39:26.660 --> 39:29.128
- I wanna go home.

39:39.140 --> 39:41.131
- Hello, Abigail.

39:43.140 --> 39:47.474
- How did you know it was me?
- Hospital called.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.687
You climbed over the wall.

39:55.990 --> 39:58.049
Where else were you to go?

39:58.090 --> 40:01.059
Home is no longer an option.

40:01.090 --> 40:03.650
Come down from there.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.041
- I don't want to go to sleep.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.787
- You can't anticipate
your dreams.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.553
Can't block them,
can't repress.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.683
- I didn't honor
any part of him,

40:32.730 --> 40:35.619
so it's just murder,
isn't it?

40:35.660 --> 40:38.993
- Most would argue
self-defense.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.863
- Then why not
tell the truth?

40:41.900 --> 40:44.095
- Most would argue.
There would still be those

40:44.140 --> 40:46.131
who would say you were
taking after your father.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.777
- You're glad I killed him.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.975
- What would be the alternative?
That he killed you?

40:56.020 --> 40:57.976
- I don't know
if he was going to.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.715
- No, you don't.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.883
- You're the one
who called the house.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.819
You talked to my dad before--

41:07.860 --> 41:11.591
What did you
say to him?

41:13.600 --> 41:16.489
- A simple conversation,

41:16.540 --> 41:19.668
ascertaining if he was
home for an interview.

41:21.810 --> 41:24.779
Then why not tell the truth?

41:26.780 --> 41:30.568
- I think you called the house
as a serial killer.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.781
Just like my dad.

41:36.890 --> 41:39.654
- I am nothing like your dad.

41:39.690 --> 41:41.829
I made a mistake.

41:41.860 --> 41:44.829
Something easily misconstrued.
Not unlike yourself.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.601
I'll keep your secret.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.675
- And I'll keep yours.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.071
- No more climbing walls,
Abigail.
