00:02.524 --> 00:04.266

00:04.391 --> 00:07.006

- Okay, thank you.

00:07.422 --> 00:08.758
<i>$20 to Netflix.</i>

00:09.853 --> 00:13.012
- <i>$20 to Blockbuster Online.</i>
- Both?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.723
I needed all 11 discs
of <I>gossip girl</I> at the same time.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.933
<i>$120 in tuition</i>

00:18.058 --> 00:20.908
<i>to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.816
They give you a little wand
and a diploma, it's fun.

00:26.047 --> 00:27.844
- What'd you major in?
- Potions.

00:28.631 --> 00:31.049
I'm gonna take you off speakerphone.
Go ahead.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.336
<i>Jessica Simpson
clip-in hair extensions.</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:36.148
I wore those once.

00:36.273 --> 00:38.626
It was a money-back guarantee,
but I forgot to return them.

00:38.751 --> 00:40.873
<i>Man-Pillow,
the pillow shaped like a man.</i>

00:41.883 --> 00:43.668
<i>Also something called
"bucket of cake".</i>

00:43.836 --> 00:45.099
You know what?

00:45.224 --> 00:47.963
I think someone stole my credit card
so cancel it.

00:48.262 --> 00:50.192
<i>Do you wanna hear
what else they purchased?</i>

00:50.317 --> 00:52.464
Don't refund anything.
Just cancel the credit card

00:52.589 --> 00:54.652
and we'll all go on with our lives.
Thank you.

00:55.646 --> 00:58.182
So...
What does a man-pillow look like?

00:58.508 --> 00:59.658
Daniel Craig.

01:01.290 --> 01:02.645
It's for my lower back.

My name is Keith,

01:24.423 --> 01:26.085
and I am your friend.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.670
Are you guys my friends?

01:29.368 --> 01:30.339
All right.

01:30.609 --> 01:31.588
Awesome!

01:31.713 --> 01:33.885
It is playground time!

01:36.402 --> 01:38.931
We're here in Eagletown,
it's two towns over.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.933
And we're all volunteering
for Kaboom!

01:41.229 --> 01:44.793
A service organization that says
it builds a playground in a day.

01:45.077 --> 01:45.991
High five.

01:46.857 --> 01:50.151
I never trust anything that quickly.
That's why I don't eat minute rice.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.607
So this whole
build-a-playground-in-a-day thing,

01:53.732 --> 01:55.543
- That's just a slogan.
- Nope

01:55.831 --> 01:57.632
One day, 24 hours.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.357
That is so incredible.

01:59.482 --> 02:02.705
I work in parks, and I know
how hard it is to get something done.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.832
Not if you have the <i>kaboom</i> spirit.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.081
You can look at a problem
and you can either go

02:07.206 --> 02:09.526
"This is a problem",
or you can <i>kaboom</i>!

02:09.651 --> 02:12.381
Blow it up
and turn it into something great.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.849
You literally <i>kaboom</i> the problem.

02:15.706 --> 02:16.802
Come on, people!

02:16.970 --> 02:19.082
I see more ground than playground.

02:19.596 --> 02:20.973
- Kaboom!
- Don't do that.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.947
One, two, three.

02:24.532 --> 02:25.728
This is tough.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.439
But think of all the kids
that will swing on this swing.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.483
Fat kids, skinny kids,
brainiacs, sluts,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.728
the gay drama kids, goths, jocks,

02:33.853 --> 02:35.226
the alternative crowd.

02:40.145 --> 02:42.755
- What are you doing here?
- I'm volunteering.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.783
I love to volunteer.

02:45.241 --> 02:46.681
The key to volunteering?

02:47.092 --> 02:48.274
A lot of pockets.

02:48.399 --> 02:49.878
For putting all the food in.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.889
The red cross has amazing cookies.

02:52.014 --> 02:53.577
I go there all the time.

02:53.702 --> 02:55.621
Meals on wheels was a bonanza.

02:55.833 --> 02:56.926
Suicide hotline,

02:57.215 --> 02:58.887
surprisingly lame spread.

03:04.075 --> 03:07.144
Thought I'd give back
to those less fortunate than myself.

03:08.113 --> 03:09.812
- You live in a pit.
- Not anymore.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.500
Living with the drummer of my band.
Living indoors.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.803
Pretty cool.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.695
Not to brag.
Kinda hard not to.

03:16.304 --> 03:17.541
Anyhow, gotta go.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.775
Me and an old Asian lady
are double-teaming some monkey bars, so.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.434
I got a remote control
and I'm controlling you.

03:25.559 --> 03:26.583
Go faster!

03:27.541 --> 03:29.291
"Go faster, Ron's the master."

03:34.672 --> 03:36.674
You have been officially <i>kaboomed</i>.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.270
Look at you two and your big <i>kaboom</i>!

03:39.395 --> 03:40.511
Great job!

03:40.787 --> 03:41.789
I got gifts.

03:42.532 --> 03:44.976
There you go for you.
And one more for you.

03:45.929 --> 03:48.001
So you guys gonna join us tomorrow
in Muncie?

03:48.126 --> 03:51.148
No, I wish,
but back to the real world.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.433
At least you guys will be
<i>kabooming</i> somewhere.

03:53.558 --> 03:54.540
Remember...

03:54.877 --> 03:57.421
Take a man <i>kabooming</i>,
he <i>kabooms</i> for a day.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.478
But you teach a man how to <i>kaboom</i>...

04:00.072 --> 04:01.615
Kaboom! Kaboom!

04:03.348 --> 04:04.829
I'm so pumped!

04:05.038 --> 04:06.687
God, I could take on the world.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.400
I could prep, like,
1,000 diagnostic tests.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.022
- In an hour!
- That's the spirit.

04:13.492 --> 04:15.336
There it is, the pit.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.991
There's something
I wish I could <i>kaboom</i>.

04:19.116 --> 04:20.087
Well, we are.

04:20.212 --> 04:22.087
It's just a slow boom.

04:22.968 --> 04:24.949
A slower, more deliberate <i>kaboom</i>.

04:25.074 --> 04:26.083
Totally.

04:26.538 --> 04:27.807
See you tomorrow.

04:37.315 --> 04:38.694
You know what this mess is?

04:38.862 --> 04:40.954
This is a list of things
we have to complete

04:41.079 --> 04:43.407
before we fill in
the pit behind Ann's house.

04:43.816 --> 04:47.152
You know what this is?
This is a <i>kaboomer</i>.

04:54.087 --> 04:56.028
Jerry, did you use
permanent marker again?

04:56.153 --> 04:57.396
I'm sorry, guys...

05:01.020 --> 05:03.177
Forget it.
Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.598
And this is clean.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.430
How do we speed up the process?

05:09.340 --> 05:11.378
How do we <i>kaboom</i> it?

05:11.770 --> 05:14.098
Rules, codes, permits, red tape,

05:14.223 --> 05:17.356
I never realized how frustrating it is
to be in the government.

05:17.659 --> 05:20.340
In my next life,
I'm going into private industry.

05:21.624 --> 05:23.030
Maybe strip mining.

05:23.385 --> 05:25.376
Everybody take out
their thinking caps.

05:25.764 --> 05:26.867
And rip them up.

05:27.848 --> 05:31.026
Then take out your doing caps,
'Cause we're gonna do something today.

05:31.151 --> 05:32.748
I have a couple in my wallet.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.334
- That's what I call condoms.
- Come on, Tom. Focus.

05:36.376 --> 05:39.463
How do we cut through the red tape?
How do we get this pit filled in? Ideas?

05:39.631 --> 05:42.232
We need to cut through the red tape
and get the pit filled in.

05:42.357 --> 05:43.090
Good.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.729
Everybody else needs to participate.
Come on, guys.

05:45.854 --> 05:48.263
These suggestions
aren't gonna suggest themselves.

05:50.223 --> 05:51.973
This idea better be good.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.412
- I support you.
- Good.

05:56.537 --> 05:59.650
You could petition to expedite
the architectural review board process.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.366
Mark, buddy...

06:01.715 --> 06:03.245
You're not listening to me.

06:03.732 --> 06:05.714
I want to <i>kaboom</i> it.

06:06.905 --> 06:08.873
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Sure.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.231
Mark's gonna help me,
so thanks for nothing.

06:11.356 --> 06:12.472
Good job, Ann.

06:13.947 --> 06:16.336
So you really wanna get
this pit filled in?

06:16.461 --> 06:20.228
- And we'll do whatever it takes?
- I am so sick of moving like a slug.

06:20.353 --> 06:21.930
I wanna move like a cheetah.

06:22.529 --> 06:25.104
Or a slug driving
a remote controlled car.

06:25.229 --> 06:27.219
Something more plausible than that,
but fast.

06:27.527 --> 06:30.305
- Would you break the rules?
- I won't murder.

06:31.111 --> 06:32.556
That's good to know.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.916
But it's actually very simple.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.688
If you wanna fill in the pit,
just go fill it in.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.608
Don't ask for permission,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.217
ask for forgiveness.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.699
I like that.

06:44.334 --> 06:47.406
So who gives me the go ahead
to not ask for permission,

06:47.574 --> 06:48.890
because...
Is it Ron?

06:49.015 --> 06:49.976
It's nobody.

06:50.101 --> 06:52.575
It's you.
You have to be bold.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.374
You wanna get the pit filled in?

06:57.653 --> 07:00.907
Then go rent a bulldozer
and fill in the freaking pit.

07:06.579 --> 07:07.551
What's up?

07:07.719 --> 07:10.762
Say you had a friend who wanted to do
something good, but a little risky,

07:10.930 --> 07:12.264
and she was kind of nervous.

07:12.441 --> 07:15.350
And this friend is me.
What should I do?

07:16.373 --> 07:17.562
You should do it.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.243
And ask your friend to help you

07:19.368 --> 07:21.376
because your friend
totally has your back.

07:21.501 --> 07:23.400
- And that friend is me.
- You'll help me?

07:23.673 --> 07:26.294
Of course, I'll do anything I can
to help.

07:26.419 --> 07:27.494
Let's do it!

07:30.026 --> 07:31.876
What are we doing?
Is it dangerous?

07:32.121 --> 07:33.744
We're not gonna murder anyone.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.589
It was crazy.
I didn't get a single permit.

07:37.714 --> 07:41.014
Nobody stamped anything,
all I did was order a backhoe,

07:41.145 --> 07:43.069
and it came with a guy who runs it.

07:44.686 --> 07:46.381
I've never rented a guy before.

07:47.207 --> 07:48.875
Wish I knew about that during prom.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.255
There was a girl at my prom
who was known as the backhoe.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.763
Mary Dunbar,
she'd let anyone massage her back.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.560
I'm so excited we're doing this!

07:55.685 --> 07:57.045
And without permission.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.768
We're giving ourselves permission.

07:59.181 --> 08:01.487
Look!
I had these hard hats made.

08:01.612 --> 08:03.412
Check it out..."kick ass".

08:03.737 --> 08:05.151
I'll take that one.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.415
Oh, my God!
Ann, this is so cool!

08:07.540 --> 08:08.852
Do you feel giddy?

08:08.977 --> 08:10.405
I'm so proud of us.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.908
Ms. Montegue, you ready?

08:13.951 --> 08:16.585
I didn't wanna tell him
my real name, you know?

08:18.336 --> 08:21.036
First speech, easy...
important moment here.

08:24.220 --> 08:26.318
We are about to fill this hole now.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.774
Not with dirt,

08:28.280 --> 08:30.967
but with the courage
of a thousand lions.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.687
And the solemn memory
of all of our friends

08:33.812 --> 08:36.417
who have fallen in this cursed hole.

08:38.138 --> 08:38.975
Dump it!

08:49.139 --> 08:50.153
What the ***?

08:52.491 --> 08:54.371
I'm okay.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.419
That beeping was sure annoying,
but this is even more annoying.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.797
I'll handle this.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.549
The monitor is not a toy, Andy.

09:11.741 --> 09:14.061
Anything is a toy
if you play with it.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.929
Chalk that up to your concussion.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.482
Well, the good news
is your cat scan's clear.

09:20.290 --> 09:21.101
Cool.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.355
Andy, I'm really happy you're okay.
Leslie was worried too.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.691
We should've checked before
to see if you were... home.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.258
I moved out. I had to go back
'cause I forgot my headphones.

09:31.383 --> 09:33.342
And I layed down
on this really comfy tarp

09:33.467 --> 09:35.865
I saw an old cereal box
I hadn't read before,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.534
so I must've drifted off.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.018
Next thing you know...

09:41.768 --> 09:42.701
Dirt.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.166
Scoot up for one sec.

09:46.299 --> 09:47.512
And back down.

09:48.228 --> 09:49.378
There you go.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.347
That is perfect.

09:51.823 --> 09:53.873
It's like I'm lying on a cloud.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.761
This is awesome.

09:56.807 --> 09:59.057
Ann and Andy, just like old times.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.321
The pit works in mysterious ways.

10:06.248 --> 10:09.279
I'm sorry about Andy,
but I'm not sorry about what I did.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.270
What's my crime?

10:11.467 --> 10:12.467
I got bold?

10:13.535 --> 10:14.949
And a little negligent?

10:16.713 --> 10:18.241
My office, now!

10:20.536 --> 10:22.662
- Can I smoke in here?
- You don't smoke.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.375
Just asking if I can.

10:24.868 --> 10:25.971
Are you high?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.770
I'm high on kaboom!

10:28.311 --> 10:30.596
Don't ask for permission,
ask for forgiveness.

10:30.721 --> 10:33.869
That's right, you never did
ask me for permission, did you?

10:33.994 --> 10:35.862
I'm sorry to burst your ka-bubble,

10:35.987 --> 10:39.982
but I just had my ass ka-handed
to me by the city manager,

10:40.174 --> 10:42.474
and now this entire
department is ka-screwed.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.728
Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.814
What the ka-*** were you thinking?

10:50.054 --> 10:53.004
I would prefer that
she ask me for my permission

10:53.276 --> 10:54.577
so I can say no.

10:54.702 --> 10:56.101
I like saying no.

10:57.706 --> 10:59.556
It lowers their enthusiasm.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.163
So I brought you some clean clothes
that I found at my house.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.249
My God, my sexy sweater!
It has a hole cut out over the bicep.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.084
- Thank you.
- No problem.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.460
No, a-cakes, seriously.

11:14.354 --> 11:15.354
Thank you.

11:15.479 --> 11:16.508
You're welcome.

11:22.284 --> 11:25.350
What do you... what do you
think is happening right now?

11:25.475 --> 11:26.976
A tragic accident...

11:27.667 --> 11:28.969
reignited feelings

11:29.094 --> 11:32.644
you thought were long dead
and we are finally back together.

11:32.963 --> 11:35.276
Andy...
we're not back together.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.404
You know that
I'm kind of with Mark now.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.490
God, is that still happening?

11:40.963 --> 11:42.033
I don't get it.

11:42.491 --> 11:45.161
- What does he have that I don't have?
- Are you serious?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.418
Everything.

11:47.564 --> 11:50.041
He has literally everything
that you don't have:

11:50.247 --> 11:51.944
a job, a car,

11:52.069 --> 11:53.670
a steady income,

11:53.795 --> 11:54.796
an address,

11:55.179 --> 11:57.629
a second pair of shoes,
table manners,

11:57.799 --> 12:00.893
the ability to say
"tampon" without giggling.

12:01.726 --> 12:04.197
Mark has his life together.

12:07.408 --> 12:09.126
I'll get you a different nurse.

12:12.526 --> 12:14.252
It's awful what happened to Andy.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.752
But sometimes when you make an omelet,
you gotta break a few eggs.

12:17.877 --> 12:20.314
What's the alternative,
no omelets at all?

12:20.715 --> 12:22.814
Who wants to live in
that kind of world?

12:22.944 --> 12:24.044
Maybe birds.

12:24.169 --> 12:25.894
Then all their babies would live.

12:29.254 --> 12:31.685
Hi, Scott Braddock, city attorney.

12:33.008 --> 12:36.044
- I didn't know that you were friends.
- I never met him.

12:36.169 --> 12:38.545
What I do know is that he could sue us
at the drop of a hat.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.551
I mean, right now
he is the most dangerous man in Pawnee.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.517
Is that all you lawyers think about?

12:43.642 --> 12:46.283
Lawsuits, and laws, and legalese?

12:47.657 --> 12:48.725
You can relax.

12:49.128 --> 12:51.713
All I'm gonna do
is go in and just say,

12:51.838 --> 12:54.083
"We're so sorry,
it's entirely our fault"...

12:54.815 --> 12:57.161
You can't say any of that.
It admits liability.

12:57.286 --> 13:00.653
You can't say "I'm sorry",
or "I apologize." It implies guilt.

13:01.025 --> 13:04.365
That's insane, I have to apologize.
Andy was the victim...

13:04.533 --> 13:06.617
- Can't say "victim".
- Of an unfortunate...

13:06.785 --> 13:08.661
Can't say "unfortunate"
and "situation".

13:08.956 --> 13:12.290
- I can't say the word "situation"?
- No, it implies there was a situation.

13:13.365 --> 13:15.013
Can I give him the pig?

13:16.132 --> 13:17.045
Pig's fine.

13:17.769 --> 13:18.629
Hi, Andy.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.193
Got this for you.

13:21.318 --> 13:22.981
Hope you squeal better.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.715
This is my friend, Scott.

13:34.879 --> 13:37.942
Andy, I just wanted to say,
I am so, so, so...

13:39.276 --> 13:41.652
filled... with emotions.

13:42.449 --> 13:43.613
As any person would.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.034
What?

13:47.827 --> 13:48.827
No miming.

13:50.843 --> 13:53.831
- You were in the pit.
- We're not conceding that point.

13:54.649 --> 13:56.209
You were in a place...

13:57.066 --> 13:58.753
we're both here now.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.166
The government...

14:02.088 --> 14:03.455
- We gotta go.
- What?

14:03.913 --> 14:05.343
- Come on.
- Wendell Adams.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.111
I'm Andrew's attorney.

14:08.802 --> 14:11.009
- It's my only option...
- Andy, stop.

14:11.293 --> 14:13.686
I've advised my client
not to speak with you.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.686
He's suing the city of Pawnee.

14:16.015 --> 14:17.774
You're suing your home town?

14:19.884 --> 14:22.634
- Can we just talk about this?
- Leslie, no.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.917
- This is terrible.
- Don't say "terrible".

14:26.042 --> 14:27.301
Don't look back.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.299
Andy, it's Leslie.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.980
Hello.
Andy, it's Leslie.

14:38.289 --> 14:40.555
<i>Psych!
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

14:40.913 --> 14:42.161
Andy, it's Leslie.

14:42.286 --> 14:46.082
Look, what did you mean
when you said it's your only option?

14:46.268 --> 14:47.792
I think we should talk.

14:48.028 --> 14:49.461
Without lawyers present.

14:49.586 --> 14:53.241
If you wanna meet, just put
a white chalk'x'on the mailbox

14:53.366 --> 14:55.164
across the street from city hall.

14:55.818 --> 14:58.150
Or call me back...
just call me back.

14:58.635 --> 15:00.569
Why aren't you returning my calls?

15:01.212 --> 15:03.067
Is it because of your lawyer?

15:03.864 --> 15:06.351
Hey, Andy, it's your aunt.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.684
Your mom or dad's sister.

15:09.388 --> 15:12.171
I don't know how to tell you this,
but...

15:12.715 --> 15:14.315
your uncle has passed.

15:15.427 --> 15:17.168
He's with Jesus now.

15:18.536 --> 15:21.519
So we're having a memorial
in 30 minutes

15:21.644 --> 15:23.071
at city hall.

15:23.969 --> 15:26.340
Hey, free guitars at city hall!
Everybody run!

15:27.154 --> 15:29.518
Because of a local disaster,

15:29.643 --> 15:30.643
you...

15:30.856 --> 15:32.286
Andy Dwyer...

15:32.752 --> 15:35.207
must go to the evacuation center

15:35.332 --> 15:38.395
at Pawnee city hall...

15:41.857 --> 15:42.982
That was weird.

15:43.688 --> 15:45.332
How long have you been there?

15:47.592 --> 15:50.114
I promise that Andy
isn't suing just for the money.

15:50.426 --> 15:52.197
Leslie, the man lived in a pit.

15:52.322 --> 15:54.671
He couldn't find a place to live
on the earth's surface,

15:54.796 --> 15:56.229
so he went under the ground.

15:56.354 --> 15:58.831
You're dealing with a grown man
who thinks like a gofer.

15:59.401 --> 16:01.410
I feel like
if I could get past the lawyers,

16:01.535 --> 16:05.004
and find out what's really going on,
I could get him to drop the lawsuit.

16:12.473 --> 16:13.721
Ann, is that you?

16:14.167 --> 16:15.952
We need to talk somewhere private.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.971
Baby, I'm back.

16:21.235 --> 16:22.485
Thank you so...

16:23.808 --> 16:25.107
Why are you naked?

16:25.275 --> 16:27.349
Because of what you said,
we're getting back together.

16:27.474 --> 16:29.353
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

16:29.478 --> 16:31.363
You should've heard
the sexy stuff she said.

16:31.611 --> 16:34.418
I said "hey, Andy, it's Ann,
can we talk at my house?"

16:34.543 --> 16:37.317
That's not how you said it,
you were like, "Hey, Andy, it's Ann,

16:37.537 --> 16:40.021
"can you talk at my house?"

16:40.146 --> 16:42.708
My God, you're such a baby.
Literally.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.417
Big naked baby, put clothes on.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.881
You know what?
I should've seen this coming.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.902
Has he showed up naked before?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.381
Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays.

16:54.343 --> 16:56.222
- Good luck.
- Where are you...

16:57.456 --> 16:58.891
None of your clothes fit me,

16:59.059 --> 17:01.584
so I'm putting an apron
over the front stuff.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.185
Is she gone?

17:05.239 --> 17:07.566
What did you mean
when you said this was your only option?

17:07.829 --> 17:09.680
Well, I'm completely broke.

17:09.934 --> 17:12.988
And my lawyer said it could be
worth upwards of $100,000.

17:13.253 --> 17:15.449
I can't believe that
you're suing for the money.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.493
I want Ann back, and she said
she needs a guy with a lot of money.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.204
- That doesn't sound like Ann.
- I can't really do her voice.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.540
But she said she likes Mark
because he's a grown-up

17:23.665 --> 17:25.770
with a bank account.
I put two and two together,

17:25.895 --> 17:28.208
$100,000,
I can probably get a bank account.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.799
Sometimes I think the right thing to do
is to not take shortcuts.

17:32.140 --> 17:33.823
I tried to fill in the pit.

17:34.115 --> 17:35.427
That didn't work either.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.018
Fine.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.099
I'll get a job.

17:40.528 --> 17:41.892
Ann will respect that.

17:42.691 --> 17:45.758
I can make six bucks a day
playing guitar in the street.

17:45.883 --> 17:48.010
- I can't make six bucks a day.
- Wait a second.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.771
I know I just said
that shortcuts are bad,

17:51.238 --> 17:53.725
but I kind of just thought
of an awesome shortcut.

17:55.295 --> 17:57.747
Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy
that you're dropping the suit.

17:57.872 --> 17:59.159
It's really terrific.

17:59.674 --> 18:00.870
I have my conditions.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.485
Never, I will not negotiate
with greedy street people.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.960
Wait, Leslie, let's hear him out.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.745
We planned this.

18:11.077 --> 18:12.883
All right, what's it gonna take?

18:13.162 --> 18:14.008
One...

18:15.090 --> 18:17.993
I want that pit filled in, sir.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.060
Is there a two?

18:25.931 --> 18:28.634
A guaranteed starting spot

18:29.620 --> 18:31.572
on the Indianapolis Colts...

18:32.201 --> 18:33.694
inside linebacker.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.674
We can't accomplish that.

18:36.799 --> 18:39.160
I think that Andy seems like

18:39.285 --> 18:42.519
he doesn't care so much
about the second one.

18:43.108 --> 18:47.112
And he would be fine
with us just filling in the pit.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.255
What do you say, Scott?

18:50.924 --> 18:54.270
- Eventually, we're gonna fill it.
- Eventually?

18:55.722 --> 18:57.753
I've already been
injured in that thing twice.

18:57.878 --> 19:01.096
And I can fall in ten more times
by "eventually".

19:01.535 --> 19:03.781
Every time I walk past that pit,
I'm forced to relive

19:03.906 --> 19:07.853
the most traumatic two separate days
of my life and wanna sue you again.

19:10.846 --> 19:13.069
Well, I hate to say it,

19:13.644 --> 19:16.972
but it really seems like Andy has us
over a barrel here, Scott.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.416
This is really happening.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.621
I can't believe it.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.333
Usually in these situations
a person says "pinch me."

19:32.875 --> 19:34.004
Is that Andy?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.469
Just one of his conditions
for the settlement, I guess.

19:40.594 --> 19:41.644
He settled?

19:43.449 --> 19:46.074
Gave up $100,000 probably.

19:46.199 --> 19:47.536
Just for one thing.

19:48.401 --> 19:50.646
The city fill in the pit
behind your house.

19:51.168 --> 19:51.994
Why?

19:52.607 --> 19:53.666
Who knows?

19:54.497 --> 19:56.819
Who knows why that gopher
does what he does?

19:57.033 --> 19:58.883
You always hated this pit!

20:03.454 --> 20:04.838
Good-bye, pit...

20:05.848 --> 20:07.162
hello, lot.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.374
How does taking risks make me feel?

20:10.936 --> 20:11.936
Amazing.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.127
Tingling sensation
throughout my whole body.

20:16.252 --> 20:17.569
I feel flushed.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.256
My muscles feel relaxed,
yet I feel awake.

20:21.381 --> 20:23.463
Just waves of pleasure.

20:26.189 --> 20:29.251
I wish there was something physical
that can make me feel this way.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.379
You did it.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.848
You thinking what I'm thinking?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.281
- There's so much more to do.
- We're so close!

20:38.477 --> 20:41.259
I'm gonna call kaboom! And check on
their availability for next year.

20:41.384 --> 20:42.384
Great.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.033
<i>Information.</i>

20:45.201 --> 20:47.188
Hi, I'd like the number for kaboom!

20:47.313 --> 20:49.371
The national playground
building charity.

20:49.796 --> 20:51.408
I hope they can work us in.

20:51.736 --> 20:53.757
<i>Sorry, there's no listing
for that name.</i>

20:53.882 --> 20:55.448
What? Are you sure?

20:56.734 --> 20:59.610
Kaboom! Is a word I made up.
It's not in any dictionary.

20:59.735 --> 21:03.615
I trick people into building playgrounds
in empty lots in their neighborhood.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.050
It's an elaborate prank.

21:05.175 --> 21:07.609
For my next prank,
I'm gonna build a hospital

21:07.734 --> 21:09.434
in a poor part of China.

21:09.654 --> 21:11.268
They'll never see it coming!
