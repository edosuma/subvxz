00:02.839 --> 00:07.400
Previously on "Dance Academy."
Ever even kissed a guy?

00:07.440 --> 00:08.880
You haven't, have you?

00:08.919 --> 00:09.679
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I've been
trying to find every possible

00:09.720 --> 00:11.320
reason not to feel this way.

00:11.359 --> 00:14.800
-My brother will break
your heart.

00:14.839 --> 00:16.399
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN): I need
a dancer for my

00:16.440 --> 00:17.800
choreography assistant.

00:17.839 --> 00:19.320
Any chance you'd
be interested.

00:19.359 --> 00:20.160
-Yes.

00:20.199 --> 00:22.760
I mean, um, not uninterested.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.320
-Not until you tell us.

00:24.359 --> 00:25.120
-Tell you what?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.440
-Who you've got a crush on.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.399
[chattering]

00:27.440 --> 00:30.640
-It's Abigail.

00:30.679 --> 00:31.600
-You can't be serious.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.479
-Oh, she just drives me crazy.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.200
TARA (OFFSCREEN): How can
you not eat that now?

00:38.240 --> 00:39.799
-It's called self-control.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.159
Try it.

00:56.119 --> 00:59.039
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:59.079 --> 01:02.439
Close your eyes.

01:02.479 --> 01:07.799
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way to life.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.799
This is my chance.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.799
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:31.079 --> 01:32.799
TARA NARRATING: A blister.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.799
Excess repeated pressure in a
concentrated area causes local

01:35.840 --> 01:38.560
heat to build up.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.560
The heat forces a separation
in the top layer

01:40.599 --> 01:42.120
of skin, the epidermis.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.319
It's the kind of
pressure that's

01:46.359 --> 01:47.519
everywhere at the academy.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.799
MS. RAINE (OFFSCREEN): First
year contemporary exam, we're

01:54.840 --> 01:56.079
ready for you now.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.719
TARA NARRATING: Olympic swimmers
train their whole

01:57.760 --> 01:59.079
lives for one race.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.400
And when it finally comes, they
can slip off the blocks,

02:02.439 --> 02:04.319
or miss their tumble turn.

02:04.359 --> 02:07.079
No matter how hard they've
worked, it can all fall apart

02:07.120 --> 02:08.280
in a moment.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.280
It's the same with dancing.

02:14.319 --> 02:17.479
When you're on stage, there
are no second chances--

02:17.520 --> 02:19.639
just your body and your will.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.039
Whether you pass or fail
is entirely up to you.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.479
-These people are sadists.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.199
Who organizes academic exams the
same week as dance exams?

02:30.240 --> 02:31.680
-Multitasking meltdown.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.360
-Right.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.560
I need your help with anatomy.

02:35.599 --> 02:36.039
-What?

02:36.080 --> 02:36.400
My help?

02:36.439 --> 02:37.400
No, no.

02:37.439 --> 02:38.439
I don't have time to
help, Katty-Kat.

02:38.479 --> 02:39.400
I've got to get A pluses
in all subjects.

02:39.439 --> 02:40.360
I'm taking advanced
physiology.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.759
Do you know how difficult
that is?

02:41.800 --> 02:44.360
-More to the point, since when
do you carebout anatomy?

02:44.400 --> 02:46.719
-Well, Natasha rang,
promising a

02:46.759 --> 02:49.159
her-daughter holiday, my choice.

02:49.199 --> 02:51.719
All I have to do is scrape in
some non embarrassing exam

02:51.759 --> 02:52.400
marks.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.360
-That's fantastic.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.439
-I'm thinking Central
Australia.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.479
She'll hate it.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.520
Oy.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.479
-Ugh.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.680
Hey, we on for rehearsal
later?

03:01.719 --> 03:03.240
-Um, I don't think
I can today.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.479
But maybe tomorrow.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.280
-Whenever.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.479
I'll wait.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.199
KAT (OFFSCREEN):
What was that?

03:13.240 --> 03:15.439
-Um, we're rehearsing for
his choreography exam.

03:15.479 --> 03:16.479
-No, no, no.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.319
My brother was just
in flirt mode.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.199
-It's Ethan.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.520
He's always in flirt mode.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.360
-Just not with you.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.080
-Uh, my point precisely.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.560
So come on, what gives,
little one?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.120
-Really?

03:30.159 --> 03:31.479
Why?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.479
-I don't know.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.120
Something came over me.

03:33.159 --> 03:35.800
I just felt like it.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.000
-So wait, no, hang on.

03:37.039 --> 03:39.800
After discussing this obsession
in nauseating

03:39.840 --> 03:40.840
detail--

03:40.879 --> 03:42.159
-I wish we were being
examined on it.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.680
-He pashes you, and you just
forget to mention it.

03:44.719 --> 03:45.479
-It wasn't a pash.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.159
It was an almost pash.

03:48.199 --> 03:50.280
-Hold on, I thought you
were into Dana.

03:50.319 --> 03:51.199
-Yeah.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.800
But I lost interest.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.479
-And plus, it only happened
after Dana rejected him.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.840
So I'm not going to read
anything into it.

03:56.879 --> 03:58.360
-Since when?

03:58.400 --> 04:00.159
-Since you guys always tell me
that I blow things way out of

04:00.199 --> 04:00.960
proportion.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.199
-Yeah, but you never listen.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.520
-Yeah, it's part
of your charm.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.599
-You know you're talking about
Tara Webster, right.

04:06.639 --> 04:07.759
-This is exam week.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.719
So I'm not going to do anything

04:08.759 --> 04:10.800
but focus on my exams.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.199
-So, you're going to go
back there again?

04:16.399 --> 04:17.560
-What do you think?

04:24.839 --> 04:26.720
-So for some unknown reason--

04:26.759 --> 04:28.399
maybe I killed someone
in a past life.

04:28.439 --> 04:31.519
SAMUEL (OFFSCREEN): Abigail,
is that you?

04:31.560 --> 04:34.279
-You're my partner in the
pas de deux exam.

04:34.319 --> 04:36.439
[toilet flushing]

04:36.480 --> 04:38.720
-They're obviously trying to
challenge me, which is fine.

04:38.759 --> 04:40.680
But also completely unfair,
as it affects

04:40.720 --> 04:42.560
my scholarship chances.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.600
-Exam stomach.

04:43.639 --> 04:46.199
Does that happen when
you get nervous?

04:46.240 --> 04:47.399
-No.

04:49.839 --> 04:51.839
We clearly have a lot
of work to do?

04:51.879 --> 04:54.199
-One on one?

04:54.240 --> 04:56.240
Awesome, awesome.

04:56.279 --> 04:57.560
I have physiology on
Wednesdays, OK.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.120
But after that I'm all yours.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.839
-I've booked the studio for
every night this week.

05:00.879 --> 05:01.959
-Right.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.399
So I'll just study instead
of sleep then.

05:04.439 --> 05:07.480
-Tonight, 8:30.

05:07.519 --> 05:09.040
-It's a date.

05:09.079 --> 05:10.279
-It really isn't.

05:13.759 --> 05:16.560
Turn.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.519
You're twisting my arms
too far back.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.720
It's the other leg.

05:22.439 --> 05:24.240
-OK.

05:24.279 --> 05:24.839
Ready?

05:24.879 --> 05:26.800
-One, two, three.

05:26.839 --> 05:28.399
[both grunting]

05:28.439 --> 05:28.800
-Right.

05:28.839 --> 05:29.480
-Again.

05:29.519 --> 05:31.560
One, two, three.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.399
[grunting]

05:33.439 --> 05:34.319
-You all right?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.160
-Three.

05:35.199 --> 05:35.680
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.639
Again.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.800
Three.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.800
[grunting]

05:47.240 --> 05:48.480
-Morning Ms. Raine.

05:48.519 --> 05:50.480
-Abigail.

05:50.519 --> 05:51.480
It's exam week.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.199
Shouldn't you be conserving
energy?

05:53.240 --> 05:57.519
-I don't think enough of
us worry about cardio.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.160
I wonder if that's something
the scholarship committee

05:59.199 --> 06:00.680
takes into account.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.800
-I wonder.

06:02.839 --> 06:05.279
-Do you know if my name's
on the short list?

06:05.319 --> 06:08.759
It's just, I've worked harder
than anyone since day one.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.439
-You have.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.079
There are other factors.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.560
-Such as?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.759
-Abigail, you're
a smart dancer.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.399
You know there are certain
limitations to your technique.

06:19.439 --> 06:21.399
I had them, too.

06:21.439 --> 06:24.120
Others have more natural
potential.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.839
We have to work to the best of
our ability, which you've been

06:25.879 --> 06:27.000
doing.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.680
-You're saying it still
might not be enough?

06:28.720 --> 06:32.480
-Abigail, sometimes ballet
can be as unfair as it is

06:32.519 --> 06:33.519
unforgiving.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.160
But in my experience,
hard work can

06:36.199 --> 06:39.360
overcome most obstacles.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.319
[music playing]

06:53.560 --> 06:54.879
-You warm?

06:54.920 --> 06:55.720
Because if you need more time,
I don't mind waiting.

06:55.759 --> 06:57.120
-I'm fine, thanks.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.600
-OK, well how about you run
it the whole way through?

06:58.639 --> 06:59.560
I think I might have distracted

06:59.600 --> 07:02.199
you last time, sorry.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.680
-Oh, that's so fine.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.079
Um, you know, it, it happens.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.120
-What happens?

07:08.160 --> 07:10.480
-People get caught
up in a moment.

07:10.519 --> 07:11.639
No big deal.

07:17.839 --> 07:19.199
So I'm starting?

07:19.240 --> 07:19.879
Fist position?

07:19.920 --> 07:20.319
-Yeah, first position.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.439
Yeah.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.639
[music playing]

07:52.240 --> 07:52.839
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Kat.

07:52.879 --> 07:54.160
-Oh, come on people.

07:54.199 --> 07:55.600
My blisters have blisters.

07:55.639 --> 07:57.519
What more do you want from me?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.079
-Nothing.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.040
-Oh, good.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.279
Well, you can stay, then.

08:04.839 --> 08:07.360
-So how's everything going?

08:07.399 --> 08:09.160
How's Tara.

08:09.199 --> 08:10.120
-I don't know.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.639
You just had rehearsals
with her.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.240
-Yeah, right.

08:13.279 --> 08:16.759
She didn't say anything
about it?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.439
-No.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.199
-I don't know.

08:19.240 --> 08:19.560
I just--

08:19.600 --> 08:21.000
-No.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.079
My friend is not a challenge
for your pathetic male ego.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.279
You'll break her heart.

08:24.319 --> 08:25.279
-Ethan.

08:25.319 --> 08:26.480
I'm heading out.

08:26.519 --> 08:27.279
-Sorry, man.

08:27.319 --> 08:28.639
I've got things to do here.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.040
-Don't you dare.

08:32.519 --> 08:33.480
Hey, Christian.

08:33.519 --> 08:34.679
Can I have a go?

08:38.840 --> 08:40.399
This idea was genius.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.399
So good to be out of
that freak show.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.360
I feel like saying, they're
just exams, people.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.080
We're not curing world hunger.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.200
No, seriously.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.200
It's like you and I are the
only two people not acting

08:51.240 --> 08:53.240
like the world is going
to explode.

08:53.279 --> 08:55.440
Everyone just needs to relax.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.559
-Yeah, they do.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.759
-So when am I going to ollie?

08:59.799 --> 09:03.159
-Well, you've got to learn how
to roll by yourself, first.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.559
-Back foot on the tail.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.799
Bend my knees.

09:08.519 --> 09:10.039
See, I'm rolling.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.440
-All right, and if you
need to turn, then--

09:12.480 --> 09:13.200
-Uh, Christian?

09:13.240 --> 09:14.440
-Back foot on the ground!

-Um, yeah, just, just,
just my bracelet.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.600
-Oh, I'll help you look.

-You really don't have to.

Look, I'm not even sure I
put it on this morning.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.799
So you really don't have to.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.080
-You're looking for jewelry
you're not sure

09:54.120 --> 09:55.360
you even put on.
