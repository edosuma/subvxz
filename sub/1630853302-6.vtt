WEBVTT

00:19.375 --> 00:21.833
Try not to try.

00:21.916 --> 00:23.916
Be like the sky.

00:31.166 --> 00:33.041
Damn it.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.708
Hi.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.541
Help me, please.

01:28.416 --> 01:29.791
Good luck.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.041
Becca. Becca.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.291
Sister.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.791
Please.

01:36.875 --> 01:38.625
Come on.

01:38.708 --> 01:40.500
- Breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.208
Hey.

01:42.291 --> 01:44.750
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.750
Becca...

01:51.833 --> 01:53.833
I'm stuck here.

01:53.916 --> 01:56.333
I need you. I'm sorry.

02:00.791 --> 02:01.916
Becca?

02:17.625 --> 02:19.666
Ich darf
az dee zolst mich gefinen.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.125
Geraldine?

02:47.208 --> 02:48.916
You again.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.708
Stop following me.

02:50.791 --> 02:52.791
What?

02:52.875 --> 02:54.958
Alma.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.500
I'm your granddaughter.

02:56.583 --> 02:57.875
I don't care who you are.

02:57.958 --> 02:59.875
I won't let you take me down.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.375
Hey, listen,
I-I'm not who you think I am.

03:01.458 --> 03:02.791
Get away from me.

03:02.875 --> 03:03.791
What's going on?

03:03.875 --> 03:05.333
Nothing. Everything's fine.

03:05.416 --> 03:07.166
Isn't it?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.833
Yeah.

03:08.916 --> 03:10.750
Everything good.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.208
If I get extended
because of you...

03:15.291 --> 03:16.666
No, don't worry.
I'm here to help.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.041
Well, at least I think I am.

03:18.125 --> 03:20.291
I don't know
exactly why I'm here now.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.125
My sister opened up this time
for me to come to you.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.041
But I was actually trying to get
to a different time later.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.125
- Right.
- Well, later for you.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.083
Like, 30 years later
when you say to my mom

03:28.166 --> 03:30.625
not to adopt her son.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.458
You don't know why you say that.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.458
Would say that.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.208
- Will say that?
- Listen.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.708
I have three young boys
who need me.

03:41.791 --> 03:43.833
I cannot get stuck here.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.833
- Do you understand?
- Oh, my God.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.083
We're supposed
to do this together.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.916
- Do what together?
- Go to your future.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.250
And stop your future self
from telling

03:50.333 --> 03:51.708
my mom not to adopt Alejandro.

03:51.791 --> 03:53.708
No, I-I-I can't do
anything like that.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.791
Oh, sure you can. I mean...

03:55.875 --> 03:57.791
I know your abilities weren't
properly developed.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.875
- I don't have abilities.
- It's okay.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.916
I got abilities,
my sister has abilities.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.083
- My dad had abil...
- No.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.041
I stopped all of that.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.125
What?

04:07.208 --> 04:09.291
What did you stop?

04:09.375 --> 04:11.416
Did she send you here?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.333
- Did she get to you somehow?
- Who?

04:14.416 --> 04:16.083
What are you talking about?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.958
What did you stop?
Did something happen

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
- to your abilities?
- Stop pestering me.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.791
Okay.

04:42.875 --> 04:45.208
Let's see what you made.
Geraldine?

04:45.291 --> 04:46.791
I made this circle.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.833
And it's all the parts of me.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.958
You keep making those.
I saw them in my dad's office.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.416
No, I've never made
anything like this before.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.291
Maybe not yet, but-but you will.
You-you do.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.166
What about the other piece?

05:02.125 --> 05:04.250
Oh.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.458
Uh...

05:06.541 --> 05:08.500
That... is...

05:08.583 --> 05:10.166
for my children.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.166
Who I miss.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.958
I see.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.750
What else could it be?

05:16.833 --> 05:19.125
Maybe it's something you're
trying to forget or hiding.

05:19.208 --> 05:20.666
Someone else's turn.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.375
Maybe that's why you told my mom
not to adopt her son.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.750
I don't know
what she's talking about.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.625
And she won't stop harassing me.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.916
No, I'm not harassing you.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.375
- I'm trying to help.
- Leave me alone.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.875
Come on, man.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.166
Guy. Guy. Come on.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.541
Damn it.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.916
Mama.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.958
Ah, Jacob.

05:56.041 --> 05:57.250
My boys.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.791
I made you something.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.541
Oh, my goodness.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.291
It's beautiful.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.416
It's a bracelet.
It has special powers

06:04.500 --> 06:06.333
to make you feel happy
so you don't have

06:06.416 --> 06:07.625
to ever come back here.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.208
I love it.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.041
I always knew you'd save me.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.041
Okay.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.625
Who wants to go outside and look

06:16.708 --> 06:19.291
- for lizards?

06:19.375 --> 06:20.708
Let's do it.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.125
Come on, come on.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.458
Why are you playing that?

06:43.541 --> 06:46.041
Are you asking
because you heard it in a dream?

06:46.125 --> 06:48.041
How do you know that?

06:48.125 --> 06:50.250
It's also an ancient Nahua song.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.750
A shaman once sang it to me
on a pyramid in Mexico.

06:54.750 --> 06:55.916
What does it mean?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.500
Maybe something.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.791
Maybe nothing.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.750
I don't know.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.041
If you're trying to get to me,
it's not going to work.

07:04.125 --> 07:06.375
I'm playing it for my sister.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.500
We made up lyrics with our dad
when we were kids.

07:09.583 --> 07:12.125
I'm hoping she'll hear me

07:12.208 --> 07:14.416
across time and space...

07:14.500 --> 07:16.958
and get me
the fuck out of this place.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.583
I'm not crazy.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.333
I don't belong here.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.041
Neither do I.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.958
I'm just trying
to help my family.

07:27.041 --> 07:29.666
Even though it seems
like they don't really want it.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.375
Will you teach me your song?

07:37.458 --> 07:40.125
That you made up
with your sister?

07:41.125 --> 07:43.166
Um, sure.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.166
It goes like this.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.458
Becca.

08:14.541 --> 08:16.083
- Alma?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.083
Oh, my God. We did it.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.833
We're doing it.
Becca, this is Geraldine.

08:20.916 --> 08:23.291
- This is our grandmother.
- Geraldine?

08:23.375 --> 08:25.000
- Look what we can do together.
- No. This isn't happening.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.125
I didn't...

08:27.208 --> 08:28.500
- I'm not...
- No, wait.

08:28.583 --> 08:29.750
Fuck.

08:33.541 --> 08:36.291
Okay, first of all,

08:36.375 --> 08:38.583
the time you sent me to
was the wrong year.

08:38.666 --> 08:40.500
- And I forgive you.
- Thanks.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.000
But I still found Geraldine.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.041
Listen, in her past,
there is something

08:44.125 --> 08:45.916
that made her tell Mom
not to adopt Alejandro.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.625
Maybe if we go
back to that day...

08:47.708 --> 08:50.041
Come on, why can't
we just go find Mom and Dad

08:50.125 --> 08:52.625
and work things out between us,
in this time?

08:52.708 --> 08:54.916
Right here. Right now.

09:00.416 --> 09:01.875
I made a mistake.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.458
I'm sorry.

09:03.541 --> 09:05.166
I lied about Alejandro
because I thought it was

09:05.250 --> 09:06.833
the best thing for our family.

09:06.916 --> 09:09.416
I was wrong. I don't know
what you want me to say.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.083
You can say more than that.
Why didn't you trust me?

09:12.166 --> 09:14.000
There were times
I tried to tell you.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.125
But it would mean
reliving all my pain.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.208
- And you didn't seem
interested.
- You're right.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.541
I knew something was wrong,
but I didn't want to upend

09:22.625 --> 09:25.333
everything, so I ignored it.
I shouldn't have.

09:25.416 --> 09:27.375
Can we stop talking about this?

09:27.458 --> 09:29.125
My chest feels
like a broken window.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.291
I don't want you to be in pain,
but I don't think

09:31.375 --> 09:33.416
not talking about it
is the answer.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.333
You have no idea what it's like

09:35.416 --> 09:37.375
to live with something
heavy like this.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.625
No!

09:44.541 --> 09:47.875
I think I can...
imagine what that's like.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.875
Look, I just want
to fix everything,

09:49.958 --> 09:51.333
so we can move forward.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.333
Some things are
too broken to fix.

09:53.416 --> 09:56.125
That can't be true.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.000
Jacob...

10:00.083 --> 10:02.041
if we're honest...

10:02.125 --> 10:05.208
this marriage was over
a long time ago.

10:05.291 --> 10:07.708
And let's be honest, huh?

10:14.458 --> 10:16.500
I'm going to stay
with my mother.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.333
I need to clear my mind.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.375
Who's that?

10:27.458 --> 10:29.291
Reed.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.875
Is that what you call
dealing with things

10:30.958 --> 10:32.458
"right here, right now"?

10:32.541 --> 10:34.416
I just don't know
what to say to him.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.416
Why don't you just
change reality,

10:35.500 --> 10:36.625
and you never have
to know Reed?

10:36.708 --> 10:37.958
- Stop it.
- Becca.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.041
- I...
- No. Let's just go.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.458
Where have you two been?

10:48.541 --> 10:49.791
Where's Mom?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.416
She went to stay
with her mother.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.416
I think our marriage
might be over.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.291
I'm booking flights home.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.458
Jesus Christ, Alma.
You're ruining our family.

10:58.541 --> 11:00.916
- There's still
a way to fix all this.
- When's the next flight?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.916
- The soonest is, uh...
- Listen, Dad.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.791
I was just
with your mom in the past.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.166
And I saw you as a little boy.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.083
You gave her this bracelet.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.833
You said it was to protect her.

11:10.916 --> 11:12.416
That was a long time ago.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.125
I know you want
to help your mom.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.000
And she's definitely
haunted by something.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.583
Something involving
her abilities.

11:17.666 --> 11:19.000
Something that she wanted
to forget.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.541
Do you have any idea
what that was?

11:20.625 --> 11:22.250
She would never
tell me about it.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.500
Well, if we figure it out,

11:24.583 --> 11:26.291
we can know why she said
what she said to Mom.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.875
And then if we can fix that,
then we can...

11:27.958 --> 11:30.458
Alma, this is like an insane
rabbit hole that never ends.

11:30.541 --> 11:31.875
You're making everything worse.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.750
- Leave it alone.
- Do you know exactly when

11:33.833 --> 11:35.875
Geraldine told Mom
not to adopt Alejandro?

11:35.958 --> 11:37.166
I know she was pregnant with me,

11:37.250 --> 11:39.041
but do you remember
a particular day?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.125
Maybe we can go there and find
out what Geraldine said.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.666
Maybe she told Mom
what happened to her.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.958
We're not doing this, Alma.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.250
Okay, so we're not
gonna do anything?

11:45.333 --> 11:46.541
We're just gonna do nothing?

11:46.625 --> 11:48.125
When we know what's possible?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.458
You're speaking from a place
of what's possible, Dad.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.375
You wouldn't even be here
if it weren't

11:52.458 --> 11:54.916
- for what's possible.
- Alma, enough.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.750
No. I want to know.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.625
What is possible?
What did you change?

11:58.708 --> 12:00.500
What is this other life

12:00.583 --> 12:03.083
- you won't tell me about?
- It doesn't matter.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.500
Yes, it does.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.958
She needs to know.

12:06.041 --> 12:09.000
She needs to believe
in the potential of this.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.625
- Tell her.
- Tell me, Dad.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.791
Please.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.833
It'll change the way you see me.

12:17.916 --> 12:20.583
No, it won't.
It won't, I promise.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.250
Remember...

12:31.333 --> 12:33.250
the car.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.083
When I was in the car

12:35.166 --> 12:37.458
driving towards the edge
of that cliff?

12:37.541 --> 12:39.958
It was your fears.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.125
Something about your fears?

12:42.208 --> 12:44.333
No.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.833
No, it was real.

12:46.916 --> 12:50.791
That was another life,
the one that Alma and I changed.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.833
I had lost my mind

12:52.916 --> 12:55.250
researching these abilities.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.125
And I was in that car...

12:58.208 --> 13:00.500
...with my assistant Farnaz.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.625
I took my life and hers.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.166
I can't believe that.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.166
Well, it's true.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.291
We were just kids
when it happened.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.666
We had to grow up without Dad.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.791
But I can't imagine

13:23.875 --> 13:25.875
my life without you in it.

13:25.958 --> 13:28.416
And I love this life, too.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.750
And I want to keep it.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.666
We have to do this.

13:41.958 --> 13:44.041
Yeah, we do.

13:45.416 --> 13:48.500
You know, it doesn't always
work out the way you want.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.583
- What do we have to lose?
- Our minds.

13:50.666 --> 13:52.750
Our relationships.
This good life.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.500
You could help your mom.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.875
You could heal your marriage.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.375
Alejandro could be our brother
from the beginning.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.916
Come on. We'll be fine.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.958
The three of us together?

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
We're unstoppable.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.166
Okay, we can try.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.791
There was a time

14:20.875 --> 14:23.291
that I remembered recently.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.541
It was the last time
that your mom visited my mom.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.416
And when I picked her up,
something was off.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.041
She was rattled.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.958
And that was the last time

14:35.041 --> 14:38.000
she visited my mom on her own.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.458
Geraldine.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.666
You're here.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.291
Good news, Jacob.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.958
The doctor says I should be able
to go home soon.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.541
Sure, Mom. Listen,
I just stopped in real quick.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.291
I have to get into work.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.875
- Just wanted to say hi.
- I'm glad you did.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.958
And I'm especially glad
you brought Camila.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.041
- Look at that belly.
- Oh, oh.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.500
You won't believe
how much she's kicking today.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.666
This one is going
to be a handful.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.666
- I brought lunch.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.583
Oh, wonderful.

15:12.666 --> 15:14.500
All right, well,
I'd better get back to work.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.708
Love you, Mom. Love you, hon.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.708
Why didn't you stay?

15:25.875 --> 15:28.166
She sees us.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.250
Hey, Mom.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.500
Is everything okay?

15:38.041 --> 15:39.583
Yes.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.666
- Fine.
- Okay.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.000
I didn't realize
they were so close.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.166
They were... for a while.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.791
They hit it off
the first time they met.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.875
My mom saw herself in Camila.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.291
A young immigrant
making a new life.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.791
Your mom was estranged
from her family.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.791
And my mom had no family.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.208
So they took care of each other.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.500
So your dad just left her there?

16:08.583 --> 16:10.458
He couldn't handle her breaks.

16:10.541 --> 16:12.416
And my brothers couldn't handle
the shame of having

16:12.500 --> 16:14.541
a mentally ill mother,
so they ignored her.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.250
Even I got busy
building my career,

16:18.333 --> 16:20.916
researching ways to help her.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.250
Camila was the only one
who spent time

16:23.333 --> 16:25.750
with Mom regularly.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.750
They became
like mother and daughter.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.416
And Camila really needed
a mother who approved of her.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.250
Sure, after her own mother
rejected her.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.375
Is something on your mind?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.916
I'm afraid to ask, but...

16:46.041 --> 16:48.166
...do you think
Jacob would be okay

16:48.250 --> 16:50.125
with adopting a child?

16:50.208 --> 16:52.000
This is the moment.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.541
You're
having a child.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.166
I know.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.666
But... another one.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.208
What do you mean?

17:04.500 --> 17:06.000
I had a son.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.750
Years ago.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.125
And I-I couldn't tell my mother.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.875
I couldn't tell anyone.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.541
Where is he?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.750
In an orphanage in México.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.125
There's a chance
a good family could adopt him.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.833
But I would like to.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.791
I... I don't know.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.291
- I have a photo I can show you.
- Oh. Oh.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.125
Like you said, a, uh...

17:29.208 --> 17:32.250
a good family could adopt him.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.750
And you're about
to start your own family.

17:36.833 --> 17:39.708
A new life.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.166
We both know how hard that is.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.333
I think it's better

17:46.416 --> 17:48.500
if you leave him.

17:48.583 --> 17:51.250
I just thought,
since I'm starting a family,

17:51.333 --> 17:53.208
he could join it.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.458
This baby is a blessing.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.291
She will brighten your future.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.458
But you have
to let your past go.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.375
That was a different you.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.583
Forget her,

18:04.666 --> 18:06.583
forget everything she did,

18:06.666 --> 18:10.541
and allow yourself
to start this new life.

18:10.625 --> 18:14.250
I speak from experience, Camila.

18:15.541 --> 18:18.000
It's best to forget it.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.583
Move on.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.916
Oh. Wow.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.250
She's dancing on my bladder.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.750
Excuse me.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.916
Hey, Mom, can I sit with you?

18:49.291 --> 18:51.208
I know you're not really here.

18:52.375 --> 18:53.875
Yeah.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.000
That's right.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.416
I'm sorry I got it wrong.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.416
What did you get wrong?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.875
I should have
just been here with you.

19:06.958 --> 19:09.666
Instead of trying to solve you

19:09.750 --> 19:11.458
like a problem.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.250
It's okay, Jacob.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.166
You're a good boy.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.333
You did fine.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.625
Mom, could you do me a favor?

19:25.708 --> 19:27.625
Would you tell Camila
that it's okay

19:27.708 --> 19:29.291
for her to adopt her son?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.375
No.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.083
I can't do that.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.875
I'm helping her.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.541
It's for you, too.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.625
But it doesn't help her.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.416
Or me.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.000
It's not really good for anyone.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.750
Especially the kid.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.166
It's better to leave it.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.541
What happened to you, Mom?

19:54.625 --> 19:57.208
What are you running from?

19:57.291 --> 19:59.833
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:02.416 --> 20:04.125
Grandma Geraldine?

20:04.208 --> 20:05.791
You again.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.416
What's this smaller piece?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.791
This thing you don't want
to look at?

20:18.708 --> 20:20.666
It's nothing.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.833
It's just something

20:22.916 --> 20:25.250
I make when I'm not thinking.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.333
What just happened?

20:40.416 --> 20:42.291
We're inside the collage.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.583
I was accessing her memory.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.625
Well, I think this might be
deeper than memory.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.250
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

20:52.333 --> 20:53.375
Oh, my God.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.625
What is it?

20:54.708 --> 20:56.125
It's Alma's door.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.666
It, it must be
a memory of Geraldine's.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.500
The memory
she doesn't want to access.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.583
The memory she wants to forget.

21:03.666 --> 21:06.375
This is where we've been heading
all along.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.666
That's not Alejandro.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.500
The child I've been hearing.

21:18.583 --> 21:21.333
That must be Geraldine
when she was little.

21:23.666 --> 21:26.291
- Geraldine?
- Hold on.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.041
Geraldine wasn't her name
when she was little.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.541
Ruchel.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.041
We're here to help.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.958
Can you open this door?
