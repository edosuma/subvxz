11:08.733 --> 11:10.833
- I think I can solve this puzzle, Retch.
- Mmm!

11:11.333 --> 11:14.867
"The Morris family is lunch"?

11:14.867 --> 11:17.667
- [ Imitating Chimes ] # Dun, dun, dun #
- You're right!

11:18.100 --> 11:20.100
- [ Up-tempo ]
- [ All Chattering, Cheering ]

11:23.233 --> 11:25.733
[ Luke ]
We won! We won! We won!

11:26.733 --> 11:29.233
- Lunch?
- Lunch? Hey--

11:29.233 --> 11:32.233
Wait a minute. What do--
What do you mean by "lunch"?

11:32.233 --> 11:36.733
The Morris family will find out
exactly what we mean...

11:36.733 --> 11:41.733
when we return to Raw Deal
right after this.

11:45.933 --> 11:49.933
- [ Flourish ]
- Welcome back. And now we'll find out...

11:50.433 --> 11:53.433
- if the Morris family are ready to
cut the deck--   - [ Coos ]

11:53.933 --> 11:58.033
for a chance to win
that brand-new, fully loaded...

11:58.033 --> 12:02.533
- sport utility vehicle of their dream.
- [ Scattered Applause ]

12:02.533 --> 12:05.533
- Ready?   - Yes, but-- but what
did you mean about lunch?

12:05.533 --> 12:08.533
[ Chuckles ]
That's why we call it a puzzle.

12:08.533 --> 12:11.533
We'll be back to see if
the Morrises drive away...

12:11.533 --> 12:13.533
in a brand-spankin'-new car...

12:14.033 --> 12:15.933
after these important messages.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.433
Hey, monster kids,
now you can have hours of fun...

12:18.933 --> 12:20.433
with your very own human figures.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.300
- [ Gibbering ]
- Scare them. Smash them. Eat them.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.733
They're your own humans.
You get Dad, Mom, Brother and Sis.

12:27.300 --> 12:31.300
Put them in water, throw them in the
air or just jump up and down on them.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.633
Human action figures!
Grandma sold separately.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.933
- We're back! Are we ever!
- [ Applause ]

12:37.933 --> 12:39.933
And a big monster hello to Danielle...

12:40.433 --> 12:42.333
out in Kalamazoo, Michigan!

12:42.933 --> 12:47.867
All right, Morrises, are you ready
to cut the deck? [ Laughs ]

12:48.467 --> 12:52.067
- Are you ready to cut one?
I love that joke.  - [ Audience Groaning ]

12:52.067 --> 12:53.767
Well, yes--
yes, we are, Retch.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.567
Well, then go ahead
and cut the deck!

12:57.567 --> 13:00.067
[ Drumroll ]

13:01.933 --> 13:04.000
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Family Squeals ]

13:04.433 --> 13:06.867
[ Up-tempo ]

13:06.867 --> 13:09.767
- [ Lizzy ] We got the car!
- [ Kisses Noisily, Giggles ]

13:10.700 --> 13:13.633
Well, not quite yet.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.900
You've won a chance
to win a new car,

13:16.900 --> 13:20.000
but not before you take the--

13:20.433 --> 13:25.033
[ With Audience ]
Horrorland challenge!

13:25.033 --> 13:29.167
- [ Bells, Noisemakers ]
- Come on, everybody! [ Laughing ]

13:31.233 --> 13:33.800
- [ Bells, Noisemakers Stop ]
- [ Audience Falls Silent ]

13:33.800 --> 13:36.833
And now, dear Morris Family,

13:36.833 --> 13:40.133
you will be given
the chance of opening one...

13:40.133 --> 13:43.900
of two-oo-oo doors.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.433
[ Fanfare ]

13:46.433 --> 13:49.733
- Wow! [ Giggles ] Ta-da!
- [ Retch ] Behind one door...

13:50.167 --> 13:52.100
is that fabulous...

13:52.100 --> 13:56.167
- sports utility vehicle.
- [ Audience ] Ahh! Ohh!

13:56.167 --> 13:58.800
And behind the other door...

13:58.800 --> 14:02.300
is Ripper, the killer beast.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.100
[ Audience Exclaims ]

14:04.100 --> 14:07.433
- You have 10 seconds to choose.
- Ripper?

14:07.433 --> 14:09.867
The clock is running.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.100
- [ With Retch ] Ten, nine--
- Um, uh, door number one.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.200
- No, door number two.
- Eight! Seven!

14:14.600 --> 14:16.500
- I-I think it's one.
- Five!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.133
- No, three!
- There is no three.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.600
- [ With Retch ] Three! Two!
- One!

14:20.600 --> 14:24.767
One it is! [ Laughs ]
Now, there you are.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.367
You have chosen door number one.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.733
So, say hello...

14:29.733 --> 14:32.267
- to Ripper!
- [ Family Screams ]

14:32.267 --> 14:34.767
[ Laughing ]

14:35.700 --> 14:38.700
[ Audience Cheering, Whistling ]

14:38.700 --> 14:41.433
- I thought they were nice monsters.
- We all did, Mom.

14:44.367 --> 14:47.033
[ Mom, Children Screaming ]

14:51.967 --> 14:56.467
- Look at this.
- Oh, Ripper doesn't leave much, does he?

14:58.667 --> 15:01.033
[ Growling ]

15:01.433 --> 15:03.867
[ Mom, Children Whimpering ]

15:03.867 --> 15:05.867
Whatever happens,
we'll face this together.

15:05.867 --> 15:08.700
- Like a family.
- Yeah, like a family-size dinner.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.200
- [ Luke Whimpers ] I'm scared.
- It's getting ready to pounce.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.233
- [ All Scream ]
- Hey! Quick, though here!

15:15.733 --> 15:18.733
- Hurry! Inside, quick! This way!
- [ Dad ] Come on, Come on!

15:18.733 --> 15:21.233
- Hurry!
- [ Dad ] Go, go, go!

15:21.233 --> 15:23.300
[ Mom Screams ]

15:23.800 --> 15:26.167
- [ Dad ] Now, come on. Hurry!
- Hurry, hurry! Okay, now listen.

15:26.167 --> 15:29.267
You have to listen to me and do
what I say. I want to help you.

15:29.733 --> 15:32.200
- [ Lizzy ] Who are you?
- - My name is Blek.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.500
And I should have been
the host of Raw Deal. Retch Sniff.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.333
Ptooey! What a no-talent.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.833
Listen to this. Heh!

15:39.833 --> 15:41.767
Welcome back to Raw Deal!

15:41.767 --> 15:44.233
- [ Chuckles ] You see? I'm great.
- Yeah, uh-- Yeah.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.500
But I'm not the producer's brother-in-law.
You know how that works.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.033
- Well, you-- you should have been.
- Yeah.

15:49.033 --> 15:51.300
But w-we just wanna get out of here.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.800
- Straight through there. That way!
- Oh.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.767
- Hurry! [ Yells ]
- [ Screaming ]

15:56.767 --> 15:59.067
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Snarling ]

16:04.133 --> 16:06.100

There they are! Get them!

16:12.333 --> 16:15.833
- [ Snarling ]
- [ Lizzy ] Oh! Oh!

16:17.367 --> 16:20.733
Oh! Oh!

16:22.233 --> 16:24.767
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Luke ] Over here!

16:32.267 --> 16:34.900
[ Screeching In Distance ]

[ Grunting ]

16:44.433 --> 16:48.533
[ Both Growling ]

16:48.533 --> 16:50.667
- Which way?
- Shh!

16:52.767 --> 16:55.200
[ Whispering ]
Quickly. This way. Go!

16:59.067 --> 17:00.500
Through here.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.067
That way.

17:11.233 --> 17:15.233
- That thing almost stepped on me.
- Yeah, we were lucky.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.733
This never'd have
happened at Zoo Gardens.

17:17.733 --> 17:19.733
Yeah, well we should have gone
to Zoo Gardens.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.233
Maybe if we keep going,
we'll find our way out?

17:22.233 --> 17:23.233
Maybe we'll never get out.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.800
Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
Let's just keep going.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.800
- [ Birds Cawing ]
- [ Insects Buzzing ]

17:30.800 --> 17:34.033
- Look.
- [ Mom ] Oh, my.

17:36.567 --> 17:40.067
Looks like we're not the first
family to appear on Raw Deal.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.000
- [ Creature ] Hey, over there!
- [ Lizzy Screams ]

17:42.600 --> 17:48.167
- [ Children Whimpering ]
- [ Screeching ]

17:51.633 --> 17:54.400
[ Luke Groans ]
I have a side ache.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.800
Keep going, Luke.
Keep going.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.333
Dad!
Dad, I can see the parking lot!

18:01.333 --> 18:04.000
- Oh!
- Let's go! Let's go!

18:05.333 --> 18:07.767
Oh, oh, oh!
Quick, though here!

18:07.767 --> 18:11.300
Oh, great!
That's it, Lizzy. Come on.

18:11.300 --> 18:15.467

Okay. Come on.

18:26.733 --> 18:30.033
[ Chattering, Screaming Continues ]

18:40.700 --> 18:42.833
- Hurry up, Dad!
- I'm hurrying!

18:44.133 --> 18:46.300
- Ah!
- Oh, for heaven's sake!

18:48.067 --> 18:50.400
[ Lizzy Continues Screaming ]

18:50.400 --> 18:52.867
Hurry up, Dad!

19:01.567 --> 19:04.567
- [ Luke ] Hurry up, Dad!
- [ Engine Cranking ]

19:04.567 --> 19:06.867
- Oh, no!
- [ Beeping ]

19:06.867 --> 19:09.233
If we had that new car,
this wouldn't be happening.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.700
Don't you think I know that?

19:11.700 --> 19:15.000
- [ Engine Starts ]
- I love this car!

19:15.000 --> 19:18.067
So long, suckers!

19:20.867 --> 19:23.333
- [ Beeping Continues ]
- [ Lizzy Screams ]

19:37.900 --> 19:39.700
- We made it.
- Yeah.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.533
I am never setting foot
in a theme park again.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.467
Or a TV studio.

19:46.333 --> 19:50.233
- Hey, Dad, where are you going?
- I don't know.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.167
I don't think this is the time
to be clowning around.

19:52.167 --> 19:54.533
I am not clowning around!

19:56.467 --> 19:58.333
Something wrong with the steering.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.367
There sure is,
because you're not steering it.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.367
- I am.
- [ Audience Laughing ]

20:07.867 --> 20:09.967

[ Gasping, Yelping Screaming ]

20:14.067 --> 20:17.500
[ Metal Creaking ]

20:17.500 --> 20:20.800
Whoa! Now that's what
I call a cliff-hanger.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.033
Will the Morris family
ever get out of Horrorland?

20:24.033 --> 20:27.900
- [ Grunting, Muttering ]
- Tune in next week to the Monster Channel.

20:27.900 --> 20:32.900
- I am sick of these scary human shows.
[ Groans ]   - [ Switches Off ]

20:32.900 --> 20:35.267
Well, perhaps we should just talk.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.267
That's a good idea.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.767
Ooh! [ Sniffs ] Mmm.

20:42.267 --> 20:46.300
- Cockroach?
- Oh, thank you, darling.
