WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.306
Previously on ER...

00:05.339 --> 00:06.674
Who did you match?

00:06.707 --> 00:08.642
University of Michigan-
Ann Arbor.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.246
Are you withdrawing
from this residency program?

00:12.280 --> 00:15.183
Your Honor...
I love my son.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.451
You'll be notified
of my decision.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.619
Alex and I have to leave.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.089
What?
I'm sorry.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.456
I don't want to go!

00:22.490 --> 00:24.525
We have to say good-bye
to our son.

00:24.558 --> 00:28.796
( cries )

00:28.829 --> 00:30.398
I can't get in
touch with my mom.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.565
The phone ain't
working or something.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.800
So, what, you need a ride?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.402
Hey, jack-off!

00:34.435 --> 00:36.437
Try paying attention
to the road!

00:36.470 --> 00:37.571
What's your problem, man?
Get outta here.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.140
Pay attention to this.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.574
Oh, nice.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.475
All right,
we're outta here.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.344
See you, suckers!

00:43.377 --> 00:45.346
PRATT ( laughing ):
Feel that hemi power, baby.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.347
It's a beautiful thing!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.484
CHEN:
Slow down!

00:51.852 --> 00:54.355
There.
Everybody happy now?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.157
Okay, good.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.262
Greg...

01:02.896 --> 01:05.132
( screaming )
Son of a bitch!

01:05.132 --> 01:06.867
He's shooting at us!
Get down!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.236
Come on. Hold on!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.637
We got to get
out of here.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.177
Hold on!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.711
Where is he?

01:17.745 --> 01:18.879
Let's go. Hold on.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.714
We've got to get away from him!

01:24.385 --> 01:25.419
( screams )

01:28.556 --> 01:30.324
Get away from him!

01:30.358 --> 01:32.160
There he is!
Watch out! Get down!

01:36.330 --> 01:37.498
Damn it.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.639
Get away from him!

01:45.673 --> 01:47.208
Where is he?!

01:49.343 --> 01:50.511
( screams )

01:50.544 --> 01:51.612
Oh! My leg!

01:51.645 --> 01:52.913
Are you hit?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.448
I'm shot.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.550
Oh...
Don't worry.
Where is he?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.857
( screams )
Watch it! Watch it!

02:14.768 --> 02:17.738
( groaning ):
Oh, God...

02:17.771 --> 02:20.441
Greg... Greg...

02:20.474 --> 02:22.643
I think I broke a rib.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.247
ELGIN:
Somebody help me...
please.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.617
All right, man,
I'll be right there, man.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.319
Don't worry.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.286
Where are we?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.222
We're in the river.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.857
Can you get out
of that seat belt?
Uh-uh, no.
It hurts.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.392
I can't move.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.396
Come on,
we gotta get out.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.431
Elgin, come on, man,

02:43.464 --> 02:44.465
we gotta get out
of the car.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.334
I can't feel my legs.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.869
( groans )

02:48.902 --> 02:51.805
Here, take my hand.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.507
Come on, take it.
I'll pull you out.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.409
I can't.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.644
Come on, man, squeeze my hand.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.778
Squeeze it.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.480
I really can't.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.582
( groaning ):
Oh, Greg,

03:01.615 --> 03:03.384
I can't get this belt off.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.453
The kid might have a
cervical cord injury.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.523
I'm gonna call for... aah!

03:09.557 --> 03:10.658
Oh, my leg!

03:15.596 --> 03:18.266
Hello? Yes.
Please help us.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.834
We're in a car that crashed
into the Chicago River

03:20.868 --> 03:23.904
near, uh, uh...
Franklin.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.806
It's wet.
I'm-I'm getting wet.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.674
( groans )

03:26.707 --> 03:28.642
Hey.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.644
Yeah, there's three of us
in here.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.845
Critically injured.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.314
Please hurry, we're sinking.

03:35.516 --> 03:39.287
ELGIN:
Why is there water?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.589
I don't want to die, man.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.357
All right, I'm coming, man.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.592
( groans )

04:42.082 --> 04:44.084
It's getting deeper.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.753
I'll be
right there, Elgin.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.854
Don't worry.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.723
Okay... Come on,
duck under this.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.924
( groans )

04:50.958 --> 04:52.660
Oh. I can't.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.827
Yes, you can.
Come on, baby.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.363
You have to.
Come on.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.664
Come on.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.965
Come on.
( groans )

04:57.998 --> 04:59.867
Yes. Get under there.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.034
Good job. Good job.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.536
Good job.
Okay.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.704
Okay.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.906
ELGIN:
Doc...

05:05.939 --> 05:07.007
What?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.909
How come I can't move?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.845
Looks like you hurt your neck.

05:11.879 --> 05:12.980
We think it might be broken.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.450
( startled yelling )

05:16.484 --> 05:18.085
CHEN:
What's happening?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.588
The weight of the engine
takes the front end down first.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.089
CHEN:
Oh, God.
I'm coming, man.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.925
Oh, God.

05:24.958 --> 05:25.959
PRATT:
All right.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.430
It's not fair.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.831
Every intern gets a vacation

05:30.864 --> 05:32.933
and I'm stuck with
the last overnight.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.436
Maybe it's 'cause you
called in sick, like,
50 times.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.004
I have Epstein-Barr, okay?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.939
It's not my fault they
haven't found a cure.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.574
Damn shame...
Uh-huh.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.076
...that we have to listen to you
whine all night.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.912
Who's the attending?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.915
Schedule says "Lewis,"
but she's on maternity leave.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.418
Maybe it'll be somebody cool
who'll let me out early.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.685
Kovac or Carter.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.920
Just as long as it is not...

05:52.953 --> 05:53.721
Morris!

05:53.754 --> 05:54.788
Bingo!

05:54.822 --> 05:56.424
15 minutes
into your shift,

05:56.457 --> 05:57.925
and you haven't picked
up a single patient?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.026
I was...
I was doing sign-outs.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.961
From who,
Colonel Sanders? Go.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.463
Where's Carter?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.031
Finishing up a lac.
Kovac?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.466
Left a couple hours ago.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.600
WEAVER:
In the middle of his shift?

06:06.634 --> 06:07.935
Said he had to go.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.070
Nice suit.
Job interview?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.639
PRATT:
Ready: one, two, three-- up.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.741
Okay, Elgin, try not
to move your head.

06:13.774 --> 06:14.608
I-I'm cold.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.776
Look, Elgin...

06:15.809 --> 06:16.877
when we roll down
that window

06:16.910 --> 06:18.512
we got to swim
out of here.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.747
I don't think
I can swim.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.081
I'll stay with you, all right?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.550
Greg...

06:22.583 --> 06:24.618
Jing-Mei, you'll be fine.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.520
Now, look, when I
open up this window,

06:26.554 --> 06:28.956
you push out and I'll pull
Elgin out behind you.

06:28.989 --> 06:29.990
All right?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.594
All right, I got his neck.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.030
All right, everybody
hold their breath, okay?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.866
Deep breath.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.543
( groans ):
Oh, damn it.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.479
What's wrong?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.647
Power windows.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.951
I need to pee.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.821
You're gonna like Louisville.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.790
They have, uh,
the Kentucky Derby,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.759
the Ohio River, hush puppies.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.795
Can I go in the bushes?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.197
Here we go.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.503
ALEX:
Have you been?

07:15.503 --> 07:16.970
What?
Louisville.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.138
Have you ever been there?

07:18.171 --> 07:21.675
Hey, it doesn't look half bad.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.978
Hey, look,
they even have a pool.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.582
( gasping, grunting )

07:30.751 --> 07:32.520
( groans )

07:32.520 --> 07:33.554
( panting )

07:33.587 --> 07:34.522
It-It's stuck.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
We're sinking.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.025
You have to wait for
the water pressure
to equalize.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.627
What?
Physics class.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.195
When the water gets
high enough in the car,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.697
you'll be able to
open the door easy.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.965
( groaning )

07:44.998 --> 07:46.600
You got to wait, man.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.709
( groans )

07:55.743 --> 07:57.711
You got to wait.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.617
CHEN:
What was that?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.118
Bottom of the river.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.055
Now what?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.625
Well, I guess we wait.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.594
( soft groan )

08:13.627 --> 08:16.764
( panting )

08:16.797 --> 08:17.698
( bell dings )

08:17.731 --> 08:19.933
TAGGART:
Hello?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.168
Hello?

08:21.201 --> 08:22.936
WOMAN ( on TV ):
Going somewhere?

08:22.970 --> 08:23.671
BOY:
I was sleepwalking.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.638
Hello?

08:24.672 --> 08:25.973
Can't you beat that?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.608
Look at this, Ma.
I'm fully dressed.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.009
Hello?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.110
I couldn't understand
a word of it.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.278
( laughter on TV )

08:31.311 --> 08:32.645
WOMAN:
Sit down.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.881
Hi.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.914
Uh, can I get a room, please?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.183
Just the two of you?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.116
Yeah.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.251
How many nights?

08:38.284 --> 08:39.720
Uh, just one.
Passing through.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.020
WOMAN:
You had a simple punishment...

08:41.054 --> 08:41.855
You folks on vacation?

08:41.889 --> 08:42.856
No.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.958
You better call the police.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.159
She's kidnapping me.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.194
Alex, cut it out.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.598
Kids.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.702
I want you get to
ready to open the door

08:54.735 --> 08:55.836
and push out
to the surface.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.137
I'll pull out
Elgin after you.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.839
Greg, I don't think I...

08:58.872 --> 09:00.974
Just do it!
Just do it.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.710
All right, Elgin...

09:02.743 --> 09:04.244
I want you to take
a deep breath

09:04.277 --> 09:05.979
and blow it out on
the way up, all right?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.147
Okay.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.916
All right, go, Jing-Mei.
Go, baby, go!

09:08.949 --> 09:10.984
( inhaling deeply )

09:14.788 --> 09:16.890
( panting )

09:27.267 --> 09:29.970
All right, big
man, you ready?
Yeah.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.971
All right, take
a deep breath...

09:31.004 --> 09:32.172
Deep breath.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.975
( both inhale deeply )

09:35.008 --> 09:37.845
( gasping, groaning )

09:37.878 --> 09:39.012
Oh! Oh!

09:39.046 --> 09:40.380
Hey!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.683
Hey! Hey!

09:42.716 --> 09:43.717
MAN:
Starboard side.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.885
Two o'clock!

09:44.918 --> 09:45.919
Oh, please, help me!

09:45.953 --> 09:46.887
( groans )

09:46.920 --> 09:48.021
Grab the ring, ma'am!

09:48.055 --> 09:49.790
Oh...!

09:49.823 --> 09:51.859
Is there anybody else
in the car?
Two more.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.061
( groans )

09:54.094 --> 09:55.663
( pained groan )

09:55.663 --> 09:58.666
( groaning,
gasping loudly )

09:58.666 --> 10:00.100
Over here!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.134
Over here!

10:01.168 --> 10:02.870
We got somebody down here!

10:02.903 --> 10:04.137
Come on,
right here.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.873
Oh, hey,
where's Elgin?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.007
I couldn't get him out.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.709
He got stuck on the door!

10:08.742 --> 10:09.409
Hey, there's
somebody else.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.978
( panting )

10:11.011 --> 10:12.379
I got to go back down
there and get him.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.147
Divers will get him. Sir!

10:14.181 --> 10:15.949
He's paralyzed.
He can't move.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.019
We don't need any more victims!
Get in the boat!

10:19.052 --> 10:21.755
Get in the damn boat!

10:25.192 --> 10:27.661
Gored by a deer antler.
Admitted to ortho.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.896
You call Animal Control?

10:28.929 --> 10:30.197
No, no-- he fell
when he was trying

10:30.230 --> 10:31.665
to hang it
on his mantle.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.900
And a woman got
her glaucoma drops

10:32.933 --> 10:33.767
mixed up
with her Super-Glue.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.068
Ouch. Nice of you

10:35.102 --> 10:37.004
to grace us
with your presence, Luka.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.438
Family emergency.
I'm back now.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.107
I don't need you now.
Go home.

10:40.140 --> 10:40.941
I still owe you
a couple of hours.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.942
This is not a co-op.

10:41.975 --> 10:42.910
Next time you decide
to leave

10:42.943 --> 10:43.944
in the middle
of a shift,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.145
don't bother
coming back.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
Frank, call
nursing admin.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.683
Tell them Sam won't
be working tomorrow.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.051
Or any other day.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.021
Family emergency.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.422
He doesn't
even have a family.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.423
WEAVER:
Is that it?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.424
Uh-huh.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.759
You look nice.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.060
You have another court date?

11:00.093 --> 11:01.094
Yup.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.095
How'd that go?
Okay.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.030
MAN:
She's lying.

11:03.063 --> 11:03.831
WOMAN:
I am not!

11:03.864 --> 11:04.865
Good luck, huh?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.366
MAN:
She's a drug dealer.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.268
Tiffany James--
foreign body
in the vagina.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.871
She tucked her stash up there
when we busted her.

11:10.904 --> 11:11.905
No problem.
I can fish it out.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.406
You'll do no such thing.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.308
Are you having any pelvic
or abdominal pain?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.409
I feel fine.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.778
This is not
a medical emergency.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.046
So I can leave?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.748
Sit your ass
back down.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.816
Doing a pelvic exam
without consent is assault.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.151
This guy said he would.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.256
Hey, Luka!

11:32.826 --> 11:34.161
Something going on with Sam?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.263
She left.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.966
She left?
She left to go where?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.333
I have no idea.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.403
Did she take Alex?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.406
Is she coming back?

11:46.439 --> 11:47.941
I don't know, I...
I don't think so.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.946
You okay?

11:52.980 --> 11:54.281
Yeah.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.049
Say goodbye to Kem
for me, will you?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.427
Frank, they need X-ray in two.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.862
Haven't you heard?

12:08.896 --> 12:10.397
New interns don't
start till tomorrow.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.799
It's my last nursing shift.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.033
I'm finally getting
out of here.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.234
You ready for it?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.102
FRANK:
I had the doctor
up my Xanax.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.469
Abby...

12:16.503 --> 12:17.938
Hey, what are
you doing here?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.139
I thought you
were in Michigan.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.407
You get kicked
out already?

12:20.440 --> 12:24.211
MALIK:
County. Meet me on Two-Bravo.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.345
You got time to grab
some coffee or something?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.880
No, I have
to get some sleep.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.148
I'm back on at 6:00.
What's going on?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.416
Nothing, except
I may have just

12:29.449 --> 12:30.951
thrown away
my medical career.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.853
I don't care
what your captain says,

12:32.886 --> 12:34.287
we do not do strip searches!

12:34.321 --> 12:35.555
Come on, Doc,
give me a break.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.957
The jail nurse
won't do pelvics.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.425
That's your problem.
Not mine.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.559
MALIK:
Yo, Dr. Weaver.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.961
Multi-victim T.C.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.195
How many criticals
can we take?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.363
Start with three.
What is it?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.531
Auto versus pole
and pedestrians

12:44.564 --> 12:45.398
and another car
in the river.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.133
Who's still on?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.434
You and Morris.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.903
Carter left and you
sent Kovac home.

12:49.937 --> 12:50.971
Abby, can you stay?

12:51.004 --> 12:51.872
No, I-I-I...

12:51.905 --> 12:52.840
Good.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.174
Somebody go
find Morris!

12:54.207 --> 12:56.176
He's probably hiding
in the bathroom again

12:56.209 --> 12:57.444
staring at Maxim.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.445
PRATT:
How you doing?

12:58.478 --> 12:59.446
( Chen moans )

12:59.479 --> 13:01.481
Did they get Elgin out?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.351
I'll be right
behind you, okay?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.989
They need to get a
collar on you, Doc.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.323
I'm fine.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.992
How come they're
not bagging him?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.126
Doc, you need a collar.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.127
Is he alive?!

13:14.161 --> 13:16.864
I don't know.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.331
OFFICER ( over radio ):
Confirming recovery

13:18.365 --> 13:19.332
of a third body.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.533
Stand by.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.335
Why aren't they doing CPR?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.972
PB 49, any vitals on
that third victim?

13:25.005 --> 13:29.276
( over radio ):
Not at this time.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.911
I'm sorry.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.318
Oh, you just left?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.887
After I spoke
to the director.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.121
Excuse me.
Where do we sign in?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.389
He was at a birthday party.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.556
Always has to be the joker.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.324
What did you
put up there?

13:44.357 --> 13:45.993
LEDs.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.961
He was supposed to just
wear them on his clothes.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
Triage nurse,
straight ahead.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.164
You know, you were only
there a couple of hours.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.565
You need to give it
more time than that.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.067
DUMAR:
Auto versus utility pole.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.368
Decent vitals,
probable dislocated hip.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.937
Give me something
for the pain, man!

13:56.970 --> 13:58.171
WEAVER:
Morris, reduce the hip!

13:58.205 --> 13:59.372
Ten of MS, slow IV push.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.941
Pedestrian with
multiple lacs

14:00.974 --> 14:03.076
from jumping
out of the way.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.344
I can take him.
No.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.445
Lily, put him in Three.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.546
I can still suture.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.248
You're no longer a student.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.516
You're not covered to
practice medicine here.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.417
You want to stay, you observe!

14:10.450 --> 14:11.919
That's it!

14:11.952 --> 14:13.320
Car flew into the river.
Probable broken ribs.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.222
Tachycardia.
GSW to the left leg.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.089
Jing-Mei?

14:16.123 --> 14:17.224
ABBY:
Oh, my God.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.059
What happened?
CHEN:
Road rage.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.127
A guy shot at us.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.261
Is the abdomen okay?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
Pleuritic chest pain.

14:23.063 --> 14:23.964
PRATT:
Get me off this damn backboard!

14:23.997 --> 14:25.165
Pratt was the driver.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.499
All right,
you start with Pratt,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.235
I'll stay with Jing-Mei.
Show me a C-spine!

14:28.268 --> 14:29.937
PRATT:
This is so stupid! I'm fine!

14:29.937 --> 14:31.438
NEELA:
Bad scalp lac.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.339
And he's combative.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.974
I'm not combative!

14:34.007 --> 14:36.977
I'm just pissed off
that you tied me down!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.146
Come on!
Get back in there!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.114
Morris, move
him to sutures.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.249
Got it!

14:42.282 --> 14:43.583
Let's go,
we need the room!

14:43.616 --> 14:45.585
MORRIS:
Dr. Chen?

14:45.618 --> 14:48.288
That's the guy.
That's the guy
that shot at us.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.689
PRATT:
I want to sign out AMA.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.292
You can't, Pratt.
You're a trauma patient

14:52.325 --> 14:53.293
with a head injury.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.562
One, two, three...

14:55.595 --> 14:58.098
First day labs, C-spine,
chest and pelvis, and a head CT.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.300
Would you stop it?
I don't need all of that.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.634
CHEN ( gasping ):
It's getting harder
to breathe.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.635
MALIK:
Pulse ox is 89.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.104
Up her to five liters.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.472
PRATT:
How's she doing?

15:05.505 --> 15:06.539
Probable sternal fracture.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.408
Don't wait for the X ray.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.977
If there's decreased breath
sounds, put in a chest tube.

15:10.010 --> 15:10.643
NEELA:
Open your mouth.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.079
( screams )

15:12.112 --> 15:13.580
Is her pain on the left
or the right side?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.248
Keep your mouth open
so I can check your pharynx.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.417
Thought you weren't
supposed to be doing anything.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.987
You're a resident,
no one's gonna care if
I kill you-- Open.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.321
CHEN:
I'm feeling dizzy.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.090
BP's 90 palp.
She could
have tamponade.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.191
Shut up, Pratt!

15:24.224 --> 15:26.226
Hello? Can I get a doctor?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.427
What? What is it? What?!

15:27.460 --> 15:29.429
Flaccid paralysis
of both arms and legs.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.498
Divers fished this dude
out of the river.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.499
Is that Elgin?

15:32.532 --> 15:33.600
Elgin Gibbs.
Is he alive?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.135
Tubed him but
he has a pulse.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.269
Elgin was with you?

15:38.505 --> 15:40.273
Abby, check him out.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.275
You're a doctor now?
No, my internship
starts tomorrow.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.210
I just advanced your residency

15:43.243 --> 15:44.644
start date 12 hours.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.180
Go. Now you're
an intern. What? You want

15:47.214 --> 15:48.215
an engraved invitation?
Go, go, go!

15:48.248 --> 15:51.218
Hey, and keep your eye on him.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.020
Make sure he doesn't get up.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.324
Both toes
are up-going.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.027
Solumedrol,
30 per kilo of bolus.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.128
Abby, what do we have?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.329
High cervical cord injury.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.463
Starting steroids.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.032
Who's the resident
on the case?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.033
That would be me.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.467
Early bird catches the worm.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.202
Fine cuts through
the C-spine.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.238
Set up for
Gardner-Wells tongs.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.639
WEAVER:
Good alignment.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.674
No fractures. You can
take him off the board.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.676
About time.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.178
How you doing, Greg?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.212
I'm fine.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.680
GCS is 15, abdomen is benign.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.349
How's Elgin,
the spinal-cord-injury kid?

16:22.382 --> 16:23.616
There's no blood
in the belly.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.684
Four of morphine
and sew this up.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.253
I'll get Morris to do it.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.055
Morris?! No, screw that,
I'll do it myself.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.222
PVC's.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.757
100 of lido,
open the crash cart.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.093
He could be accumulating blood
in the pericardium.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.228
We need a stat echo--
run in a liter of saline.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.329
How the hell
did this happen?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.564
Some kind
of hit-and-run.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.266
They caught the guy,
he's next door.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.767
Any JVD or muffled
heart sounds?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.070
Dr. Pratt...
Check for
pulsus paradoxus.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.204
Back off, Pratt, or I'll check

16:44.237 --> 16:46.073
your rectal tone
with my crutch.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.507
Somebody has
to call my house.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.176
My dad's nurse.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.143
Her name's Marie...

16:50.177 --> 16:51.311
Both lungs are up.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.313
I was supposed
to take over at 9:00.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.447
She needs to stay longer.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.216
Mediastinum
appears normal.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.518
GSW to the left leg.
She barely has pedal pulses.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.552
Did I transect the artery?

16:59.586 --> 17:00.753
CORDAY:
Order an angiogram.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.389
We need to check
compartment pressure.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.124
Okay, she's bradying down.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.724
WEAVER:
Amp of atropine.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.761
MARQUEZ:
Dr. Weaver,
Abby needs you now.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.463
NEELA:
For Elgin?

17:10.497 --> 17:12.232
Prep the entire leg,
open a cut-down tray.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.601
Some guy named Eduardo
on line two.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.104
Says he's
Sandy Lopez' brother.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.271
Sounds upset.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.106
Wait, wait, wait,
is Henry okay?

17:19.138 --> 17:20.640
Who?
My son.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.209
I don't know.
He didn't say.
Well, go find out.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.542
Doc, we're getting
a judge to issue

17:23.576 --> 17:25.145
a body cavity
search warrant.
Good for you.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.346
How much longer
is it going to be?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.414
LOCKHART:
He dropped
his pressure.

17:27.446 --> 17:28.648
I ordered
two units of O neg.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.250
Dr. Weaver, my
wife is in the car

17:30.283 --> 17:31.651
and has some questions.
I'm kind of busy here.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.221
Henry's fine,
but this Eduardo

17:34.254 --> 17:35.722
still wants
to talk to you.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.424
ABBY:
I think he has
decreased breath sounds

17:37.457 --> 17:39.126
on the left.
I agree.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.660
You don't work
here anymore.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.429
FRANK:
He wants to meet with you
as soon as possible.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.763
He says
it's important.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.198
Take a message.
BP is only 80.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.199
What's the hemocue?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.500
11 point three.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.568
Okay, good breath sounds.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.536
It's spinal shock.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.670
Dopamine at ten mikes.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.704
You don't think
a chest tube?

17:51.738 --> 17:52.772
No. Re-check the hemocue.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.374
It needs time to equilibrate.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.876
If it's not dropping,
he's not bleeding.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.245
I'll be with Chen.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.247
I should try and
call his mother.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.418
What size suture you using?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.787
Four-oh nylon.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.158
Morris, I shave my melon, man.

18:11.158 --> 18:14.394
Go with the five-oh,
minimize the scar.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.396
CORDAY:
Compartment pressure is 42.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.664
I've lost the pulse.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.233
Kerry, Abby's doing
a thoracotomy.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.033
What?!

18:23.936 --> 18:27.474
Who's getting a thoracotomy?
Elgin?

18:27.507 --> 18:28.608
Aorta's clamped.
More suction.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.343
Are you out of your mind?

18:30.377 --> 18:31.844
LOCKHART:
He was coding.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.880
I told you he didn't even need
a chest tube.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
He had three liters of blood
in his chest.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.716
What?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.451
You want the cell saver?
WEAVER:
Yes.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.486
Mrs. Gibbs,
this is Neela Rasgotra

18:39.519 --> 18:40.787
from County General Hospital.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.589
Your son Elgin
was in a car accident tonight.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.556
It's pretty serious.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.192
When you get this message,

18:45.225 --> 18:47.194
can you come to
the Emergency Room
and ask for me?

18:47.194 --> 18:48.595
It was a machine.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.635
Last one.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.439
Beautifully averted
and well approximated.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.375
You are definitely a lightweight
when it comes to morphine.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.876
C.T.'s ready.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.313
Okay. Greg, time to wake up.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.215
Greg.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.682
Greg, come on.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.789
Oh, crap, he's
got a blown pupil.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.325
Intubation tray,
20 of etomidate,
100 of sux.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.326
Should I get
Dr. Weaver?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.360
Get the head down.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.861
Soon as we tube him,

19:21.894 --> 19:24.231
I want 80 of Mannitol.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.333
I need suction
and an end tidal C02 detector.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.235
Here we go.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.270
Charge to 30 again.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.541
Asystole.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.443
WEAVER:
How much O-neg
has he had?

19:36.476 --> 19:37.877
MARQUEZ:
Eight units.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.346
CORDAY:
Ruptured the
proximal aorta.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.347
FFP and platelets are here.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.548
What about a side biting clamp?

19:41.581 --> 19:42.549
There's nothing left to bite.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.254
Are you done?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.291
Stop compressions.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.992
Pratt's herniating.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.761
CORDAY:
What?!

20:00.700 --> 20:01.634
We need to close his chest.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.303
His mother's coming.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.505
I don't want her to have
to see him like this.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.946
Keep the head
at 30 degrees

20:13.980 --> 20:15.315
and his MAP in the 90's.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.516
Hyperventilate?
To a PCO two of 30.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.917
Morris?
Epidural bleed.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.487
Mannitol's on board.
He was awake and alert.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.755
Classic presentation
with a lucid interval.
It's a skull fracture.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.424
Probably tore the middle
meningeal artery.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.393
Abby, call the O.R., tell them

20:26.426 --> 20:27.860
we need an ICP monitor.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.832
Hello.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.368
Hey, you ready?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.537
Sorry, I got stuck
with a sick kid.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.471
I called the restaurant.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.539
They can take us
at 9:30.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.740
Let me throw on
a clean shirt--

20:40.773 --> 20:41.941
I'll be ready to go.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.610
Maybe we could just
stay home

20:43.643 --> 20:45.478
and watch a movie.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.323
Sure.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.564
How does Thai food sound?

21:07.934 --> 21:10.437
The, uh... take-out menus

21:10.470 --> 21:13.606
are in the kitchen
top drawer, yeah?

21:22.048 --> 21:25.452
The good news is the pupil
went down with Mannitol.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.487
The bad news is
Greg needs surgery

21:27.520 --> 21:30.390
and he might have
long-term brain damage.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.658
So it's wait and see?

21:31.691 --> 21:33.693
Yeah.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.631
So what happened in Michigan?

21:38.665 --> 21:41.401
Can we maybe talk
about it tomorrow?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.671
Sure.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.508
You should go home
and get some rest.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.079
Go on, I can finish this.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.381
I'll stay.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.615
You start in
a few hours.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.549
I think I started tonight.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.384
Go. Really.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.818
I'm okay.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.388
You don't have privileges
here anymore, remember?

22:01.388 --> 22:03.390
Don't think I'm going to be sued
for missing a suture

22:03.423 --> 22:04.924
on a dead boy's chest.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.826
Go.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.528
I'll wait for his mother.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.900
We'll talk tomorrow?

23:12.525 --> 23:13.960
Hi... this is Sam.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.464
Leave a message
after the beep. Bye.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.240
KOVAC:
Has he woken up yet?

24:34.273 --> 24:35.775
Not as of 6:00 a.m.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.611
With all the trauma,
the board's a mess.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.581
PICU can take the baby up
after change of shift.

24:41.614 --> 24:45.017
Two more messages from
that Eduardo guy.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.553
He's persistent.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.587
Where do you want
the fresh meat?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.221
Interns?
Right there.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.690
Ray. Ray Barnett.

24:50.723 --> 24:51.724
Luca Kovac.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.125
Are you Dr. Weaver?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.627
Yeah. Sorry, I've
been up all night.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.762
You could've fooled me.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.129
Howard Ritzke.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.932
WEAVER:
Orientation's in
the second floor

24:59.966 --> 25:01.668
auditorium at 8:00 a.m.
with the new house staff.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.604
And the elevator's
that way, right?

25:04.637 --> 25:05.738
Thank you.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.574
So, we come back here
at what time?

25:07.574 --> 25:08.675
Whenever you're through.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.577
Here's the labs
on the baby.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.177
Out of here.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.745
That explains it.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.715
All right, I gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.584
Sorry, my alarm
didn't go off.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.851
How are Pratt and Chen?

25:18.885 --> 25:20.252
In surgical ICU.
They're both stable.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.721
Good.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.156
Did the other interns
go upstairs already?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.258
They did,
but you've been excused.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.794
What?

25:27.827 --> 25:30.129
I have a few pass-ons
for you from last night.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.297
I don't have to go
to my orientation?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.732
You have an I.D.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.333
You know where
the bathrooms are.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.603
All you need is a lab coat.

25:36.636 --> 25:40.640
Welcome to County,
Dr. Lockhart.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.812
Excuse me. You a doctor?

25:45.845 --> 25:48.681
Yes, I am.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.350
Sara's stool tested positive
for botulism toxin.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.251
What?!

25:52.284 --> 25:53.319
Will she get better?

25:53.352 --> 25:54.821
It can take a month.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.288
A month on
the breathing machine?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.257
She needs oxygen
and tube feedings

25:58.290 --> 25:59.659
until her muscles recover.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.293
How could
she get botulism?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.162
The spores can be present
in honey, corn syrup...

26:03.195 --> 26:04.797
She doesn't get that stuff.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.266
I cook and puree everything
for her myself, by hand.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.267
Honey?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.236
What?

26:10.269 --> 26:13.105
Oh... Damn it, Jeffrey.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.240
You don't give
honey to a baby.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.708
How am I supposed
to know that?

26:15.742 --> 26:18.344
It was in the book.
You never read the book?

26:18.377 --> 26:19.378
Why don't we all just...

26:19.411 --> 26:21.213
You gave me
four books.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.750
I do the diapers, the bottles,
the cleaning, the shopping...

26:23.783 --> 26:25.184
Excuse me, do you know anything
about a search warrant?

26:25.217 --> 26:26.218
We're not doing it.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.154
It was one book,
and I told you

26:28.187 --> 26:31.323
which book...
Hey, it's not like I want
to be doing this!

26:31.357 --> 26:32.759
I know you're
both upset, but...

26:32.792 --> 26:33.926
The only reason
why I am working

26:33.960 --> 26:35.294
is 'cause you lost
yet another job

26:35.327 --> 26:37.664
because you can't control
your damn temper!

26:37.664 --> 26:39.198
Good luck.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.133
Look, I was up all night finding
a judge to get that warrant

26:41.167 --> 26:44.203
Yeah, yeah. Where does it say
that we have to do the search?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.673
Wait a minute.
You want me to go back
to get a court order

26:46.673 --> 26:48.007
to compel you
to do the search?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.141
If we start doing cavity
searches for the cops,

26:49.175 --> 26:50.777
word's gonna get out

26:50.810 --> 26:52.344
and people are gonna
be afraid to come here.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.980
Who? Drug-dealing hookers?

26:54.013 --> 26:55.314
Fine! I'll get the order!

26:55.347 --> 26:56.983
You refuse that,
I'll arrest you.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.153
( man coughing loudly )

27:01.187 --> 27:03.222
How long do those
batteries last?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.691
This guy's
spitting up blood!

27:04.724 --> 27:05.725
Hi, I'm Ab...

27:05.758 --> 27:06.959
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

27:06.993 --> 27:07.994
George Pisoni,

27:08.027 --> 27:09.228
history of oral malignancy.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.329
Cancer of the tonsil.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.198
Been going like this all night.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.033
LOCKHART:
CBC, PT/PTT, type and cross.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.267
Bayonets,

27:15.301 --> 27:17.069
gelfoam and some Cetacaine.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.204
Can you stop the bleeding?

27:18.237 --> 27:19.972
I'm going to do
the best I can.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.908
Open up.
Yankauer's ready.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.710
( gurgling )

27:27.146 --> 27:29.015
It's just a little
numbing spray.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.049
Nice coat.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.054
( sudden moan )

27:35.087 --> 27:36.355
It's a mess in there.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.057
Two operations,

27:38.090 --> 27:40.459
lots of radiation.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.028
This should help it clot.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.310
Sorry.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.314
Maybe you would be
more comfortable

28:02.348 --> 28:03.750
holding that yourself.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.465
Okay, you're bleeding

28:19.498 --> 28:23.770
over... a large area,

28:23.770 --> 28:26.405
so we may need to put
a breathing tube in your throat

28:26.438 --> 28:28.307
to protect your airway.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.176
( weakly ):
No...

28:30.209 --> 28:32.044
Hemocue is 8.5.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.980
You might also need
a transfusion.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.181
No, thanks.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.884
I have an advance
directive.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.888
Yeah, but if we don't stop this,
you're could bleed to death.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.858
I guess...

28:45.892 --> 28:48.895
maybe...

28:48.928 --> 28:50.863
today's the day.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.834
( gurgling )

29:04.877 --> 29:07.146
Alex.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.916
Alex, come on.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.491
I could have been dead

29:19.525 --> 29:20.860
and you wouldn't even
have noticed.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.094
If we leave now,
we can make it

29:22.128 --> 29:23.863
halfway to Florida
before dinner.

29:23.896 --> 29:24.964
I don't want to go to Florida.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.198
You can swim in the ocean.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.199
So what?

29:27.233 --> 29:28.334
All right, how about

29:28.367 --> 29:29.969
my cousin Fran's
in Atlanta?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.037
Her place smells.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.372
Fine, where do you want to go?

29:33.405 --> 29:34.841
Back to Chicago.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.208
That isn't an option.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.144
Come on, we don't
have time for this.
No.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.211
You want to stay here?

29:39.245 --> 29:40.980
Yeah.
Really? Right here?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.849
Yes.
And I can't
change your mind?

29:42.882 --> 29:43.883
Nope.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.018
Okay.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.556
We'll stay here.

29:50.589 --> 29:53.192
We'll stay right here
in this pool

29:53.225 --> 29:55.261
for the rest of our lives.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.538
I found another
treatment option.

30:06.572 --> 30:07.940
Will it cure my cancer?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.311
Nebulized epinephrine.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.446
It's like a vapor,
you inhale it,
and sometimes,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.249
it constricts the blood vessels
and stops the bleeding.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.986
How long
will it last?

30:20.019 --> 30:22.054
It's, it's just temporary.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.168
You're sure?

30:41.107 --> 30:43.409
Yes. Yes.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.450
I'm getting tired.

30:51.483 --> 30:55.554
As your blood count drifts down,
you get sleepy.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.159
Will it hurt?

31:00.192 --> 31:03.295
HALEH:
If it does...

31:03.329 --> 31:05.431
...we'll give you morphine.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.465
Okay.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.107
Will...

31:15.141 --> 31:16.943
Will you stay with me...

31:16.943 --> 31:19.946
Will you stay with me
awhile?

31:19.946 --> 31:21.147
Sure.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.950
Abby, paramedics have
a new chest pain

31:23.983 --> 31:25.051
and a febrile seizure.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.690
I'll be here, George.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.060
Make sure you get
everything you need.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.361
Thank you, Haleh.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.597
And I'll be back,
Mr. Pisoni, okay?

31:49.241 --> 31:52.979
Greg? Greg,

31:53.012 --> 31:55.514
yeah, you're intubated.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.049
You had an epidural bleed.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.124
Excuse me.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.558
Can he get
a pen and paper?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.231
Hey...

32:12.264 --> 32:13.599
welcome back.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.149
"I have a shift at 8:00 a.m."

32:30.182 --> 32:32.418
( laughs gently )

32:32.451 --> 32:34.086
Well, you're late.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.487
It's already noon.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.233
Gellin's d-dimer is positive

32:47.266 --> 32:50.269
and the spinal tap on Gomez
looks like viral meningitis.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.237
The coat suits you.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.538
Thank you.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.373
Dr. Kovac, are you
expecting a collect call?

32:54.406 --> 32:55.274
No.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.410
Area code 502?

32:58.444 --> 33:01.313
Want to grab
some breakfast?

33:01.347 --> 33:03.049
No, I'm too busy.
Do you live here now?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.216
I slept
in the call room.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.484
I gave up my apartment
a few days ago.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.186
Have you been up
to see them?

33:07.219 --> 33:10.589
Jing-Mei's okay,
but Greg hasn't woken up yet.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.525
Well, it's only been
a couple hours.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.727
Now, whatever happens,
stay calm,

33:15.761 --> 33:17.263
be professional
and respectful.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.564
We can always appeal

33:18.597 --> 33:20.166
if we don't like
the court's decision.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.133
Kerry, did you get
my messages?

33:21.167 --> 33:22.701
I really don't think

33:22.734 --> 33:25.337
there's anything else
for us to talk about, Eddie.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.539
Mr. Lopez, I don't think
it's appropriate for you...

33:27.573 --> 33:29.241
Just, please,
let me have a minute, okay?

33:29.275 --> 33:34.080
We've all agreed to let
the court decide this matter.

33:34.113 --> 33:34.780
You know, with you working
so much,

33:34.813 --> 33:36.348
my parents are retired

33:36.382 --> 33:37.483
so they're home
all the time for Henry...

33:37.516 --> 33:39.151
Please, Mr. Lopez,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.487
Dr. Weaver is well aware
of your family's concerns.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.688
No, please.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.191
Kerry, two minutes.
Please, two minutes.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.792
JUDGE:
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez,

33:46.825 --> 33:49.661
you have now agreed that a full
order of legal and physical

33:49.695 --> 33:52.631
custody will be granted
to Dr. Weaver, for Henry,

33:52.664 --> 33:54.166
and that you will continue

33:54.200 --> 33:56.268
in your current
role as caregiver

33:56.302 --> 33:57.369
during Dr. Weaver's
working hours?

33:57.403 --> 33:58.837
BOTH:
Yes, Your Honor.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.340
With visitation rights
on holidays, as specified.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.641
Yes.

34:02.674 --> 34:06.512
We just want to be a
part of Henry's life.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.613
Thank you.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.282
Thank you. Thank you.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.418
Sounds better.
60 of Prednisone.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.522
MARQUEZ:
Films on Rowland.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.291
Okay. Set me up for
a sugar-tong splint.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.460
Repeat EKG on Harper.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.196
Oh, Bolus 5000 of heparin.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.264
And we can't get
an I.V. on Grant.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.167
Okay, I'll do
a central line.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.268
Have you met
the new interns?

34:29.301 --> 34:30.168
No. It's about time.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.570
Put 'em to work.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.472
Actually, Luka wanted you
to see a few more patients

34:33.505 --> 34:35.274
with them first.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.507
Why can't
he take them around?

34:36.542 --> 34:37.743
He left a couple hours ago.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.578
Again?!

35:01.200 --> 35:02.534
Luka!

35:02.568 --> 35:03.535
Luka!

35:17.849 --> 35:20.186
How about here?

35:27.759 --> 35:28.860
It's okay.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.568
( sighs )

35:36.602 --> 35:38.337
Is there a prayer?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.806
I don't know.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.615
We should say something.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.626
We miss you...

36:07.966 --> 36:09.768
...and you'll always be
in our hearts.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.443
"Il y a un
temps pour
tout,

36:17.476 --> 36:20.679
"un temps pour toute

36:20.712 --> 36:23.915
"chose sous les cieux.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.617
"Un temps pour etre

36:25.651 --> 36:29.855
"ne et un temps
pour mourir.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.924
"Un temps pour rire

36:32.958 --> 36:37.329
"et un temps pour pleurer.

36:41.767 --> 36:47.839
Un temps pour danser et
un temps pour s'affliger."

37:16.468 --> 37:17.836
I want you to stay.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.807
I can't. I can't.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.744
( moans )

37:25.777 --> 37:27.479
Please?

37:27.513 --> 37:30.416
I want us
to be together.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.687
I want to marry you.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.917
Think I could get
something to eat?

38:05.951 --> 38:06.952
I'll order you a tray.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.387
Been here almost 18 hours.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.721
I'm aware of that.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.523
You've held up a bed,
woken up two judges

38:11.557 --> 38:12.758
in the middle of the
night, and now the head

38:12.791 --> 38:13.825
of the Public
Health Department

38:13.859 --> 38:15.594
is coming here
to do your exam.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.362
Really?

38:16.395 --> 38:18.364
Really.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.931
He's driving all the way in here
from Lake Forest just for you.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.833
And he's really
happy about it, too.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.670
He says he hasn't
actually done a pelvic
in about ten years,

38:24.703 --> 38:26.638
but he's willing to
"give it a shot."

38:28.740 --> 38:30.709
So, you can either wait here
for another hour

38:30.742 --> 38:31.810
for the old guy to get here

38:31.843 --> 38:33.379
and give you what, I'm sure,

38:33.412 --> 38:35.481
will be a remarkably painless
and gentle exam

38:35.514 --> 38:37.649
or you can
let me do it

38:37.683 --> 38:39.851
right now.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.989
Hey. Signed, sealed, delivered.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.123
She's all yours.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.492
You did the exam?

38:46.525 --> 38:47.959
No, it was more like
self-service.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.828
I need you to sign
a death certificate.

38:49.861 --> 38:50.896
On who?

38:50.929 --> 38:52.864
Tonsil guy
finally bled out.

38:52.898 --> 38:53.799
George?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.401
Mm-hmm.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.001
When?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.769
About an hour ago.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.405
Well, why didn't you
come and find me?

38:59.405 --> 39:01.573
He was a DNR.
You were busy.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.544
But you were you with him?

39:05.577 --> 39:06.978
Yeah.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.114
He was comfortable?

39:09.147 --> 39:10.982
Yeah.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.954
NEELA:
Is now a good time?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.756
If you're too busy, I'll just
come back after your shift.

39:17.789 --> 39:18.790
No, it's fine.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.058
Abby, where's the Marcaine?

39:20.091 --> 39:21.527
Drug lockup.
Middle cabinet.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.861
Right. And the drug...?

39:22.894 --> 39:23.962
Behind you.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.564
Thank you.

39:25.597 --> 39:26.732
Who's that?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.967
It's one of the
other new interns.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.135
Okay, what happened?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.970
I told my residency director

39:32.003 --> 39:34.139
I didn't want
to do an internship.

39:34.172 --> 39:34.973
In Michigan.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.041
Anywhere.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.510
What?! What did he say?

39:38.544 --> 39:39.811
He told me
to think about it.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.480
You're lucky
he didn't fire you.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.748
It would've made
life simpler.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.082
Diarrhea boy's
at it again.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.551
Okay. You know,
you can't get a license

39:45.584 --> 39:46.518
without doing an internship.

39:46.552 --> 39:47.719
So?

39:47.753 --> 39:48.787
So you can't
practice medicine.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.021
Right.

39:50.055 --> 39:50.956
That's crazy.
It's one more year.

39:50.989 --> 39:51.957
I don't want to do it.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.124
Oh! Eight years
of school.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.793
You're so close to
the finish line.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.028
What are you going to do,
just throw away your future?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.830
I'm not sure
it's the future I want.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.098
Abby...?
I'm coming!

40:00.131 --> 40:01.733
Let's get something
to eat later.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.743
What are you
doing, Sam?

40:11.777 --> 40:12.778
What I do.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.613
You knew that.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.982
I don't stay in one place
that long.

40:17.015 --> 40:20.185
How long
can you keep doing that?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.221
Long as I have to.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.056
Can't keep running away.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.092
Sure, I can.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.197
This isn't just about Steve.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.732
I'm sorry.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.703
Sometimes there's a little
collateral damage.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.639
I have to do this
for Alex.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.741
From what I can tell,
it's not working for him.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.811
Well, he's ten.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.045
He doesn't know
what's working for him.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.815
Is this the life
you want for him?

40:49.848 --> 40:51.449
For yourself?

41:01.727 --> 41:03.529
I don't know
what else to do.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.697
Go to your car
and follow me back to Chicago.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.734
You don't have
to do this alone.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.702
I'm here.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.905
You can trust me.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.009
It's not something
I'm good at.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.145
Why not give it a try?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.651
It can't be any worse
than this.

41:25.684 --> 41:26.685
( laughs )

41:26.718 --> 41:27.786
Can it?

41:35.093 --> 41:38.630
Come on.
We should get going.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.032
I don't want
to miss my flight.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.034
( sighs )

41:43.068 --> 41:44.703
When are you
coming back?

41:48.273 --> 41:51.009
I'm not sure.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.848
Well, my schedule's
flexible.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.751
I can come and visit
in a few weeks.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.820
Can we talk about
it when I get back?

42:04.690 --> 42:07.593
Sure.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.763
I'll just need a bit
of time, you know?

42:11.797 --> 42:15.834
Just... I've
got to rest.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.803
Get back
into work.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.645
You didn't answer
my question.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.920
( sniffles )

42:34.953 --> 42:37.623
It's okay.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.625
I love you.

42:44.162 --> 42:45.931
You don't have
to answer me now.

42:45.964 --> 42:49.768
I'm just not ready.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.645
Well, will you think about it?

43:01.046 --> 43:03.014
Will you
promise me that?

43:03.048 --> 43:04.816
( crying )

43:04.850 --> 43:07.118
I just don't know
what to think about anything.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.090
It just all
happened so fast,

43:12.123 --> 43:14.092
and felt so right, didn't it?

43:14.125 --> 43:15.794
( crying )

43:21.867 --> 43:23.802
Well, it is right.

43:28.674 --> 43:30.809
Just give me
a bit more time, okay?

43:41.086 --> 43:43.689
( passionate sigh )

43:43.689 --> 43:45.691
I love you, too.

43:45.691 --> 43:47.993
I love you so much.
