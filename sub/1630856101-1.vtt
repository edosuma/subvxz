01:37.836 --> 01:40.361
Sam, Sam.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.632
Hey, Emily, I got you, okay?

01:53.417 --> 01:56.377
How are we gonna find our way out?

01:57.421 --> 01:59.554
First, this is for you.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.050
Mom gave this to me.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.052
She said I'm always safe when I wear it.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.616
It's gonna keep you safe, okay?

02:20.140 --> 02:24.361
Now don't let go of my hand
till we're out, got it?

02:25.188 --> 02:25.971
Mom, mom?

02:43.337 --> 02:45.037
Where are you off to?

02:45.121 --> 02:46.992
Just going on a date.

02:49.908 --> 02:52.653
When am I gonna meet
this new suitor of yours?

02:52.737 --> 02:56.396
New suitor, dad, it's the 21st century.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.134
He's my boyfriend.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.314
Ah, boyfriend, right, okay.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.100
Well, you guys have been
spending a lot of time together.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.103
I think it's time I meet this boyfriend.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.233
Yes, you should, and I want you to.

03:11.539 --> 03:16.024
There's just some things,
it's little complicated.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.984
Ooh, goodness,
I'm gonna be late.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.331
All right, I love you, Dad.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.595
Complicated how?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.208
Nope, no, no, no, no.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.825
Tony, why did we hire
the local preschoolers

03:33.909 --> 03:35.218
to design these labels?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.219
These labels are awful.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.481
I might as well fire the kids

03:37.565 --> 03:39.352
and finger paint these labels on myself.

03:39.436 --> 03:44.441
You know, it would I help
if you gave me some guidance.

03:45.225 --> 03:45.790
Guidance?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.495
You know how when you try my Norton,

03:51.579 --> 03:54.280
you get these notes of black cherry?

03:54.364 --> 03:55.977
Or if I blend the Norton
with the Chambourcin,

03:56.061 --> 03:57.544
it curbs the acidity,

03:57.628 --> 03:59.807
giving it more fruit-forward
taste with a dry finish?

03:59.891 --> 04:02.332
That's what these labels
need to feel like.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.509
I mean, do any of these labels

04:05.593 --> 04:08.030
make you think black cherry?

04:09.466 --> 04:12.994
I mean, come on, this
isn't rocket science.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.388
What do I even pay you for?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.521
I'm the co-owner and
technically I do payroll,

04:17.605 --> 04:18.522
so I pay you.

04:18.606 --> 04:19.827
You're missing the point.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.438
I need you to fully realize my vision.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.961
Our vision, Parker.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.876
Okay, I get enough
frustration from the staff.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.921
If you can't get this,
then maybe we should,

04:27.005 --> 04:30.055
I don't know, I'll figure
something else out.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.883
I'll put you anywhere
else if you can't do this.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.189
We'll pull even more numbers.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.754
I need to know what
are these charges, well?

04:38.495 --> 04:39.279
Toys.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.370
Or that cherry.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.161
Every kid deserves a toy for Christmas,

04:49.245 --> 04:52.556
even if they suck at finger painting.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.645
Besides, we can use that as a write-off.

04:58.689 --> 04:59.954
Hey, listen, Parker, it's late, okay?

05:00.038 --> 05:03.262
Let's table this till tomorrow, huh?

05:27.631 --> 05:29.549
Hi, my love, I'm here.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.551
Well, I'm glad you could make it.

05:31.635 --> 05:32.552
Are you kidding me?

05:32.636 --> 05:34.946
You're the highlight of my day.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.731
I wouldn't be anywhere else,

05:37.815 --> 05:40.473
but I did think Parker
would never let me leave.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.691
That guy is so difficult.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.305
Anyway, did you order already?

05:46.389 --> 05:48.525
Oh, just a glass of wine.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.830
Two Nortons.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.441
One Reserve Cellar for the lady.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.617
One Hermannhof for the gentleman.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.358
Right on time.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.056
You spoil me.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.318
Are we ready to order?

05:59.402 --> 06:00.014
Can you actually give us a couple minutes?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.625
Of course.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.061
Uh, with tonight's wine,
might I suggest the steak?

06:03.145 --> 06:04.712
Thank you so much.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.458
You know, it feels naughty

06:08.542 --> 06:11.548
drinking competition's wine.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.028
It does, doesn't it?

06:16.724 --> 06:18.160
Can I be honest?

06:19.770 --> 06:23.168
I really don't understand
the whole rivalry thing.

06:23.252 --> 06:28.257
I mean, you need diversity
to inspire innovation, right?

06:28.910 --> 06:29.566
I'll toast to that.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.567
Right?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.308
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.224
You know, it is pretty good.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.449
That is, but I think
I like yours more.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.625
Oh, you admit it.

06:45.709 --> 06:46.626
I don't know know.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.409
Oh no.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.458
What?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.372
Emily, hon, can you get under the table?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.417
No.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.245
Please get under the table.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.682
No, not again.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.207
Please, get under the table, please.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.948
Great, last time.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.642
Yes, thank you.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.914
Ah, there you are.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.311
I think I figured it out.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.748
We have to approach this
whole thing differently.

07:21.832 --> 07:22.793
Hear me out.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.534
Please, have a seat.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.232
I say we treat this like
a pirate's treasure map.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.712
We have the edges torn a little bit,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.453
but the color palette has
to match the flavor profile,

07:30.537 --> 07:32.190
you know what I mean?

07:33.409 --> 07:34.584
Oh, thank you.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.547
How do you even know I was here?

07:37.631 --> 07:39.200
I tracked your phone.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.332
What?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.594
You did what?

07:41.678 --> 07:42.813
It's a company phone.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.902
I have to know where
you're at at all times.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.643
How'd you know I was coming?

07:46.727 --> 07:48.993
And why'd you get the 2020?

07:49.077 --> 07:50.690
Well, that's all they had.

07:50.774 --> 07:55.126
Nonsense, the 2020's
vastly inferior to the 2021.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.567
Where's the waiter?

07:57.651 --> 07:58.611
I want this removed now.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.612
Excuse me.

07:59.696 --> 08:00.613
Parker, brother?

08:00.697 --> 08:01.614
Which one's yours?

08:01.698 --> 08:04.138
Everybody likes the 2020

08:04.222 --> 08:07.664
as well as they like
the 2021 and the 2022.

08:07.748 --> 08:11.102
You make good wine, let it rest.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.713
Most people wouldn't know
good wine from grape juice.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.281
What are you drinking?

08:16.365 --> 08:18.196
Just Norton.

08:20.804 --> 08:24.507
Wait a minute, this is a Hermannhof.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.900
Why are you drinking this?

08:26.984 --> 08:29.947
'Cause I just felt
like drinking Hermannhof.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.163
It's quite good actually.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.520
While I question your taste,

08:37.604 --> 08:39.565
guess it's not a bad idea
to know your competition,

08:39.649 --> 08:43.177
even if George is a total has-been.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.178
Has-been?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.484
May I take your order?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.051
Yes, let's talk about this right here.

08:47.135 --> 08:51.838
This vintage, the 2020, it's
not as good as the 2021.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.624
Could you please not
serve it here anymore?

08:54.708 --> 08:56.277
Wait, what?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.628
That's not an answer,
look, this is a local place.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.890
I'd hate to think the locals

08:59.974 --> 09:02.675
aren't getting the best from our winery.

09:02.759 --> 09:03.676
I'm sorry.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.765
Don't be sorry, be better.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.420
Could I just talk with a manager?

09:08.504 --> 09:10.640
As I was saying,
Hermannhof's old news,

09:10.724 --> 09:11.989
George is washed up,

09:12.073 --> 09:13.425
and if it weren't for
us buying his grapes,

09:13.509 --> 09:15.035
then he'd probably be out of.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.820
That's enough.

09:16.904 --> 09:20.171
How dare you talk about
my father like that?

09:20.255 --> 09:22.260
What, are you spying on us?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.566
Wait, Tony, what is she doing here?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.089
Emily.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.525
I am his girlfriend.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.177
Seriously, I am your girlfriend,

09:30.439 --> 09:31.835
and you wanna talk about this later?

09:31.919 --> 09:36.100
You're dating the princess
of that has-been winery?

09:36.184 --> 09:37.797
Has-been, how dare you?

09:37.881 --> 09:40.974
Tony, I need to speak
with you outside right now.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.236
Apologies, the manager's left.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.760
Forget it, forget it, forget it.

09:43.844 --> 09:44.761
With this guy.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.760
Get the steak au poivre.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.289
It'll pair better with
that below-average wine.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.770
I'll make it up to you.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.946
Have a good night.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.034
I'm so sorry.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.383
What?

09:58.467 --> 10:00.559
I am so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.955
What are you thinking?

10:05.039 --> 10:08.306
This is idiotic, moronic
and simultaneously insane.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.613
Yeah, no, Parker, but I
really care about her, man.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.701
Forget it, you know the deal.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.789
Dump her or you're out.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.226
That contract was stupid.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.576
Why can't I be with a girl that I like?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.883
Because the girl you
like is the competition

10:19.967 --> 10:22.625
and that jeopardizes our winery.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.671
This is not classified
military intelligence, Parker.

10:25.755 --> 10:26.977
It's just wine making.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.282
Oh, just wine making.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.545
And you know, the only one

10:29.629 --> 10:30.894
who cares about competition is you.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.807
End it with her or you're out.

10:34.982 --> 10:35.765
Got it.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.031
See you in the morning.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.467
Don't be late.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.814
Right.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.736
I seriously do not know how much more

10:46.820 --> 10:49.869
of your wicked stepbrother I can take.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.219
Right, yes, I don't know what to do.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.656
You should not have to put up with this.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.701
How are you putting up with this?

10:55.785 --> 10:56.963
He's family.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.402
And besides, you know how
much the winery means to him.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.270
I know.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.406
And I would never wanna get
in the way of your dreams.

11:05.490 --> 11:10.150
I just, I wish you hadn't
put that stupid clause

11:10.234 --> 11:11.587
in your contract, baby.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.329
I mean, okay, we gotta strategize on this.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.201
There's gotta be something we can do.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.245
Yeah.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.596
You're right.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.815
Can you send him on a extended trip

11:22.899 --> 11:24.861
somewhere very far away?

11:24.945 --> 11:28.078
But then he's just gonna come back.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.606
I got it.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.868
What?

11:31.952 --> 11:33.478
It is so obvious.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.740
What's obvious?

11:34.824 --> 11:37.743
Okay, what is one of the only things

11:37.827 --> 11:39.832
that can make someone change?

11:39.916 --> 11:41.138
Therapy?

11:41.222 --> 11:43.967
No, not therapy, something so much better.

11:44.051 --> 11:47.318
But we're gonna need help, come on.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.082
This is my bag.

12:12.166 --> 12:12.952
That's definitely my bag.

12:13.036 --> 12:16.042
No, it's not, this is my bag.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.391
This is most definitely my bag.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.958
I bought it right before we left.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.699
Well, maybe you left your bag at home.

12:20.783 --> 12:21.700
This is my bag.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.483
Are you kidding?

12:22.567 --> 12:23.746
How many times?

12:23.830 --> 12:24.703
Hi, what seems to be the problem?

12:24.787 --> 12:26.270
He's trying to take my bag.

12:26.354 --> 12:27.532
Okay, I get it.

12:27.616 --> 12:28.359
There's tons of bags that look alike.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.665
Is there a possibility

12:29.749 --> 12:31.275
that one of you guys could be mistaken?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.886
We can just look at the luggage tag.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.322
The tag must have gotten ripped off.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.846
Well, we can just open it up

12:36.930 --> 12:38.978
and get this fixed really quickly.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.847
No, all right, fine.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.203
What about this bag?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.944
This belong to one of you?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.859
I'm so sorry.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.861
This is my suitcase.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.036
Thank you so much.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.690
You guys are welcome.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.257
And I know traveling can be
stressful, so happy holidays.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.125
You too.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.790
What, 10 missed calls?

13:13.488 --> 13:14.405
Hey.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.886
Sam, I need you to come home.

13:16.970 --> 13:17.887
I'm working.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.192
You are always working.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.978
All right, well,
I just happened

13:22.062 --> 13:25.326
to land in St. Louis, so what's going on?

13:44.084 --> 13:47.090
It's like not much has changed.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.409
Sam.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.454
Emily.

14:03.538 --> 14:04.977
Hi.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.284
Oh, I missed you so much.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.285
Oh, me too, I am so glad you're home.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.113
Oh, dad went out for a run.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.943
Okay, I'll see you when he
get here, what's going on?

14:14.027 --> 14:14.987
Let me tell you.

14:15.071 --> 14:15.988
Okay.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.774
Oh, I've missed you.

14:20.163 --> 14:23.953
It's just so complicated,
and the thing is,

14:24.037 --> 14:25.998
to me, it's really frustrating

14:26.082 --> 14:28.566
because emotionally
I'm ready, you know?

14:28.650 --> 14:31.090
I'm 100% ready to go public

14:31.174 --> 14:33.919
with our relationship, but we can't.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.139
Because you're the competition.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.357
Yes.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.707
Okay, what does this have to do with me?

14:39.791 --> 14:44.103
Well, I was thinking that
you could distract Parker

14:44.187 --> 14:46.149
or possibly date.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.674
Date Parker?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.154
You literally just went on a rant

14:51.238 --> 14:52.198
about that he's such a jerk,

14:52.282 --> 14:53.199
and now you want me to date him.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.635
Yes, I did, I did do that,

14:54.719 --> 14:56.115
but I'm telling you, Tony and I,

14:56.199 --> 14:58.291
we cannot officially be seen together.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.511
Otherwise, he will lose
his shares in the company,

15:00.595 --> 15:03.685
and that man has worked so hard, Sam.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.647
And?

15:06.731 --> 15:10.347
And, okay, if you do this,
Parker will be distracted,

15:10.431 --> 15:14.177
number one, and he will also
be dating the competition,

15:14.261 --> 15:16.657
number two, so if both of
them are dating competition,

15:16.741 --> 15:20.400
then it really makes the whole
thing null and void, right?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.098
I mean, it's kind of perfect.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.840
And what makes you think
he's even gonna like me?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.016
Is that a serious question?

15:27.100 --> 15:29.189
Sam, everybody loves you.

15:30.451 --> 15:34.281
I have all the faith in
the world in my sister.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.026
Hi.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.375
Oh my god.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.290
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.162
Sam, this is my boyfriend, Tony.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.511
Hi.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.644
Boyfriend, yeah, just
heard so much about you.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.254
Does Dad know?

15:48.338 --> 15:50.996
No, but I'm, I'm sure it'll be just fine.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.130
And he definitely won't fire you.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.958
So Tony, your stepbrother really needs

15:56.042 --> 15:58.003
to sign off on your dating life?

15:58.087 --> 16:00.701
Yeah, I mean, basically
we have this agreement

16:00.785 --> 16:02.355
that we drew up when we
first went into business.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.227
It lists reasons for termination,

16:04.311 --> 16:05.706
forfeiting of shares in the winery.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.231
One of them is putting
the company in jeopardy,

16:08.315 --> 16:10.973
and Parker thinks I'm
doing that by dating Emily.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.278
Wow.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.759
You don't have to do anything crazy.

16:14.843 --> 16:18.154
We just need you to, you
know, run interference.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.417
Take him on a date or two.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.114
Yeah, I mean, he's got a one-track mind,

16:22.198 --> 16:24.116
so we think that a little bit of romance

16:24.200 --> 16:26.075
will make him less.

16:26.159 --> 16:29.336
Persnickety, petulant, perturbed.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.037
I don't know.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.083
He's actually, he's
pretty much just awful.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.606
Yeah, he's awful, sorry.

16:35.690 --> 16:40.132
Okay, and this is the best
idea you two came up with?

16:40.216 --> 16:41.699
It's great.

16:41.783 --> 16:45.395
So you can't date Emily
until I date Parker.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.272
Yeah.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.796
I wanted to deal with difficult people,

16:51.880 --> 16:54.581
I would just stick to
my day job, you know?

16:54.665 --> 16:57.193
No, I mean, he's a good person.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.935
He's just shrewd when
it comes to the winery.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.892
Look, Sam, Tony and I
are, we are so in love.

17:05.459 --> 17:10.336
I mean, really, like, I'm
crazy about this guy, okay?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.772
But the truth is

17:11.856 --> 17:14.297
is that we can't be together
unless Parker changes,

17:14.381 --> 17:17.865
so I am really needing my big sister.

17:17.949 --> 17:18.866
No.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.434
No, no, no, that's cheating,
don't make that face.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.741
Do not make that, she
does this all the time.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.697
Okay, okay, fine, fine, I will try.

17:28.873 --> 17:29.790
Okay.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.575
Under one condition.

17:31.659 --> 17:36.275
If you do have kids, you have
to name one of them after me.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.363
Deal.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.364
Deal.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.975
Deal, you heard that?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.237
Well played.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.240
All right, where do
I find this Parker guy?

18:12.482 --> 18:14.270
Excuse me, I was hoping
to speak to the winemaker.

18:14.354 --> 18:17.273
Yes, that's me, but if
you'd like to do a tasting,

18:17.357 --> 18:21.625
you can speak with that
woman by the counter.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.798
I wanna speak with you.

18:25.191 --> 18:25.974
Me?

18:27.193 --> 18:28.414
I was wondering what inspired you

18:28.498 --> 18:30.025
to make your Norton
Chambourcin blend,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.027
the one with and without oak.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.116
I was surprised at how much I like

18:34.200 --> 18:36.463
the non-oak version better.

18:38.073 --> 18:41.471
You like the Archer's
Red more than the Crossbow?

18:41.555 --> 18:43.299
I thought I would like
the oak version better,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.476
but this one has the
plum and cherry notes,

18:46.560 --> 18:49.087
and then it's also super
sweet with that spicy finish.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.262
I loved it.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.437
Most palates aren't sharp enough

18:51.521 --> 18:52.482
to discern the difference.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.266
Are you a sommelier?

18:54.350 --> 18:57.832
No, I love wine, but I'm not an expert.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.492
Well, you're probably
better than most of my staff.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.146
Years of practice.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.147
Really, what's that mean?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.536
I'm Samantha.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.367
Parker.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.455
Nice to meet you.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.587
Nice to meet you.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.590
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

19:13.674 --> 19:15.461
no, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.376
You're doing it wrong, excuse me.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.421
Well, we just finished the tasting

19:18.505 --> 19:19.683
and they just wanted.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.945
That white won't be appreciated

19:21.029 --> 19:24.380
for its subtle notes
after tasting the reds.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.561
Guys, we're gonna get you
some water and crackers.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.172
On it.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.565
So that you could really
appreciate our latest vino.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.176
It'll help you cleanse your palate.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.613
Is this a full-bodied rose?

19:36.697 --> 19:38.093
Yes.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.270
You don't see a lot
of these in the States.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.750
So Parker, it's Parker, right?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.361
Yeah.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.450
What about that private
tour you promised me?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.060
I don't do tours.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.366
Come on, it says right here

19:50.450 --> 19:54.239
you have a proprietary cold press process.

19:54.323 --> 19:55.414
I don't even know what that is,

19:55.498 --> 19:57.895
but I'm sure you could explain it to me.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.505
Yeah, it's simple.

19:59.589 --> 20:03.074
We cool down our harvested
grapes prior to fermentation.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.507
Can you show me?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.423
Okay, follow me.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.779
Oh, you're welcome.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.041
So are you from around here?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.478
From everywhere, flight attendant.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.219
Eh, must be nice to travel.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.221
Tasted wines from all over the world.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.441
Well, the wine here in
Missouri's a little different

20:22.525 --> 20:24.704
from what you'd find in
other places like California.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.749
Really?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.098
Our grapes have to be heartier

20:27.182 --> 20:28.360
to deal with the wide
ranges of temperature,

20:28.444 --> 20:30.580
humidity, frost and floods.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.496
Is that why the Norton
wine is here in Missouri?

20:33.580 --> 20:34.497
Correct.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.063
The Norton grape is less finicky

20:36.147 --> 20:39.371
and produces a nice
full-bodied dry red wine.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.851
We also have a Chardonel,

20:40.935 --> 20:44.333
which is a blend of the
Chardonnay grape with a Seyval.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.899
Is it buttery like Chardonnay?

20:45.983 --> 20:48.511
Fruit forward, but dry.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.991
Some people like it better
than the Chardonnay.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.558
It's got a superior wine quality to it,

20:52.642 --> 20:57.299
while also having high
productivity and cold-hardiness.

20:58.605 --> 21:02.089
I take it most people don't
see this part of the tour?

21:02.173 --> 21:03.526
I've been wanting to add it to the tour,

21:03.610 --> 21:05.180
but as you can see,
the climate has to stay

21:05.264 --> 21:06.790
within a certain temperature for the wine.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.400
You got it.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.402
So those over there will
be bottled later this week,

21:10.486 --> 21:12.709
and these over here will be aging

21:12.793 --> 21:16.492
in stainless on oak
for the next few years.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.411
You said you just bottled some whites.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.414
Can you show me how you bottle them?

21:22.498 --> 21:23.763
Aren't you nosy?

21:23.847 --> 21:24.764
What?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.244
Sure you're not a spy?

21:26.328 --> 21:30.683
No, I'm just really interested
in all this stuff, so.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.683
It is pretty interesting, huh?

21:34.684 --> 21:38.691
I love what I do, but
to answer your question,

21:38.775 --> 21:39.779
we use a mobile bottler.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.128
Helps cut overhead costs,

21:41.212 --> 21:42.652
and I don't have to
deal with the equipment.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.480
Smart, we should be using that.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.481
What's that?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.309
Oh, nothing, nothing.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.313
So do you want to try an early tasting?

21:51.397 --> 21:52.488
From the tanks?

21:52.572 --> 21:53.445
That's right.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.577
Yeah.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.707
They haven't fully matured yet, but

22:04.497 --> 22:06.586
I think it's coming along.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.503
Let me know what you think.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.334
So?

22:16.291 --> 22:17.817
It's good.

22:17.901 --> 22:22.169
There's like pepper notes on
black cherry, no, plum, right?

22:23.429 --> 22:25.172
Are you sure you're not a sommelier?

22:25.256 --> 22:26.565
If I was, I'd be able to tell you

22:26.649 --> 22:30.656
the year of your grapes,
and sadly I can't.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.484
We'll just have to have you try some more.

22:33.656 --> 22:34.878
Ah, excuse me.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.923
I have a delivery,
I'll be right back.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.623
George, how's it going?

22:40.707 --> 22:42.625
I got four pallets
out in the truck for you.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.366
All right, let me radio the team.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.628
I'll notify them right away.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.758
Pope is in the Vatican, boys and girls.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.112
It's gotta eat you up a little to know

22:52.196 --> 22:54.637
that I win more awards with
your grapes than you do.

22:54.721 --> 22:59.465
Wine is wine, I'm just happy
we can all do what we love.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.471
George, Hermannhof's been the leader

23:02.555 --> 23:04.908
in Herman for generations.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.213
It's gotta be hard to see

23:06.297 --> 23:08.172
some new kids winning
the C. McWilliams Award

23:08.256 --> 23:11.001
and the Senator's Cup
these past few years.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.090
We lost to this guy?

23:13.174 --> 23:14.396
Well, Parker, without challenges,

23:14.480 --> 23:15.745
we can't better ourselves.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.789
It's a good philosophy,
if you can apply it.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.753
Hey, I hope you bring your A game

23:23.837 --> 23:25.494
to this year's
Christmas blender.

23:25.578 --> 23:30.583
Though that may have been your
legacy, soon it'll be mine.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.588
Whatever you say.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.980
See you at the city
council meeting tomorrow.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.373
Yep.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.248
What was that?

23:41.332 --> 23:46.210
That was the legendary
wine maker at Hermannhof.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.691
I used to look up to him.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.301
What happened?

23:50.385 --> 23:51.346
Couldn't keep up with the times.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.649
Tastes change, people change.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.526
If I win this year's local blender.

23:57.610 --> 23:58.831
Blender?

23:58.915 --> 24:02.574
Oh, it's a red blend holiday competition.

24:02.658 --> 24:05.269
If I win, we will finally become

24:06.445 --> 24:09.059
the most award-winning winery in Hermann.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.233
You love being the best, don't you?

24:14.017 --> 24:16.588
I accept nothing less.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.503
Wow, well, would you look at the time?

24:18.587 --> 24:20.462
This has been educational.

24:20.546 --> 24:23.334
Thank you so much, but
I'm gonna have to go.

24:23.418 --> 24:26.032
Hey, look, I don't really
make new friends easily,

24:26.116 --> 24:29.993
but I really enjoyed
spending time with you.

24:30.077 --> 24:34.780
Would you wanna talk more
about wine at a later date?

24:34.864 --> 24:35.648
Sure.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.134
How will I find you?

24:41.218 --> 24:42.614
Don't worry, I'll find you.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.230
He's pompous, he's conceited.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.494
He just talks about himself,
you should have heard him.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.497
He's on and on and on, it was nauseating.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.628
Tried to warn you.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.021
I get it.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.719
He's good looking, but
that's probably about it,

25:00.803 --> 25:02.286
and what is this

25:02.370 --> 25:04.419
about us selling our
grapes to Reserve Sellers?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.333
Well, Reserve Sellers
does things differently

25:06.417 --> 25:07.552
than a lot of other wineries.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.554
They outsource parts of their process

25:09.638 --> 25:10.990
to keep their overhead
down, which is actually

25:11.074 --> 25:12.775
a really great idea
when you think about it

25:12.859 --> 25:15.212
because if you don't have to
focus on growing the grapes

25:15.296 --> 25:19.521
and the bottling, you can
focus on the actual wine.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.784
That's exactly what Parker likes.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.350
You see his genius.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.787
He's still a jerk.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.180
Sometimes those
two things go hand in hand.

25:27.264 --> 25:31.358
I don't know, I don't think
I can soften this guy up.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.403
Well, if anyone can, you can.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.749
Not this one.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.495
He's worse than my first class passengers.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.670
That is bad.

25:38.754 --> 25:39.758
It's terrible.

25:39.842 --> 25:40.803
Dad.

25:40.887 --> 25:41.804
Hey.

25:41.888 --> 25:42.758
Hey, dad.

25:44.107 --> 25:44.891
Sam.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.854
Wow, you're a.

25:48.938 --> 25:49.852
Surprise.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.118
Hi, honey.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.029
Hi, Dad.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.729
We missed you at Thanksgiving.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.518
Yeah, I was stuck in New York.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.780
Ah, yeah.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.434
Well, your sister made the cranberry sauce

26:03.518 --> 26:06.698
and it was as good as your mom's.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.001
Can we talk?

26:09.045 --> 26:11.007
Can it wait till tomorrow?

26:11.091 --> 26:12.704
Honey, I've had a day

26:12.788 --> 26:14.924
and then we've got another
one tomorrow with the.

26:15.008 --> 26:15.925
Christmas.

26:16.009 --> 26:16.926
Christmas Blender.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.493
Yeah.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.755
We can talk in the morning.

26:19.839 --> 26:20.883
Sure.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.889
Welcome home.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.588
Okay, you girls don't stay up too late.

26:31.764 --> 26:35.292
Wow, new record, made it a whole day.

26:35.376 --> 26:36.293
What do you mean?

26:36.377 --> 26:37.294
What do you mean?

26:37.378 --> 26:39.339
Don't play dumb, you know.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.907
It's the same fight
every time I come home.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.562
Well, you could come home more often.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.608
We would just fight more.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.611
Sam, you guys really need to work it out.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.614
We're family, we're
supposed to stick together.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.264
You tell him that?

26:58.268 --> 27:00.317
Do you remember when
I made this for you?

27:00.401 --> 27:01.971
I do, how old were you, five?

27:02.055 --> 27:03.059
Yes.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.060
It's pretty cute.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.363
It's the cutest.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.723
Oh, hey.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.417
Good morning, dad.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.250
I wasn't sure you were
still an early riser.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.381
I'm a flight attendant.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.644
I have to be at the airport

27:22.728 --> 27:23.732
at four in the morning sometimes.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.211
Is this for me?

27:25.295 --> 27:26.079
Bless you.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.647
Oh, not too shabby.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.960
I missed your coffee.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.135
I think I'm just a little bit more patient

27:36.219 --> 27:38.921
when it comes to brewing it than you are.

27:39.005 --> 27:39.748
Oh, is that what it is?

27:45.315 --> 27:49.758
Dad, why didn't you tell
me about reserve sellers?

27:49.842 --> 27:51.324
What about them?

27:51.408 --> 27:54.545
I don't know, that
they're kicking our butts.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.940
Ah, honey, you can't stay champs forever.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.985
That boy genius makes good wine.

28:00.069 --> 28:03.072
Besides, I was never the wine maker.

28:05.074 --> 28:05.901
Your mom was.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.909
At least our Nortons
are still the best, huh?

28:10.993 --> 28:12.432
We can take this guy.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.613
You gonna come home and help?

28:18.697 --> 28:19.480
Yeah.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.791
No, I didn't think so.

28:22.875 --> 28:26.925
Would it really kill you
just to stay a little longer?

28:27.009 --> 28:28.971
What about the
Christmas Blender dad?

28:29.055 --> 28:31.582
I can make a blend that'll
get us back on top.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.628
We have the talent, we have the grapes.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.108
We just have to think outside the box.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.544
I don't think so.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.368
Why not?

28:40.414 --> 28:43.376
The Christmas Blend
was your mom's specialty.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.987
And even mom knew that
we had to change the blend

28:45.071 --> 28:46.858
every year depending on the harvest set.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.252
I don't know how many times
I have to say this to you.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.863
We don't change the Christmas blend.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.299
Dad.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.214
We do not change your
mother's Christmas blend.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.125
You got it?

28:57.953 --> 28:58.954
Yeah.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.177
Now, if you really wanna help,

29:01.261 --> 29:04.960
you can help me get these
boxes outta the truck.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.535
Oh, hey Parker, there you are.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.058
I just wanted to remind you

29:13.142 --> 29:14.494
about the Chamber of
Commerce meeting tonight.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.105
Oh, I know, are you joining me?

29:16.189 --> 29:18.760
Miss a chance to see
you yell at the chamber

29:18.844 --> 29:20.065
for some obtuse reason,

29:20.149 --> 29:23.199
I wouldn't miss it with the world, bro.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.767
You know our booth place
last year was bogus, right?

29:25.851 --> 29:26.811
Could you care that?

29:26.895 --> 29:27.812
No it wasn't.

29:27.896 --> 29:28.813
Yeah, it was.

29:28.897 --> 29:29.814
No it wasn't.

29:29.898 --> 29:30.859
Yes it was.

29:30.943 --> 29:31.860
No it wasn't.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.032
Yes it was.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.951
Well, I see you didn't forget

29:36.035 --> 29:38.954
how we do things around here.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.564
Dad, remember when Emily and I

29:40.648 --> 29:43.001
used to play down here
when you mom used to work?

29:43.085 --> 29:45.525
I remember, you girls used to love

29:45.609 --> 29:47.484
to play hide and seek when your mom

29:47.568 --> 29:49.613
would work on her blends.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.921
Those were good times.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.580
Yeah.

29:56.664 --> 30:00.932
Okay, so this, this is my
batch for the Christmas Blender.

30:01.016 --> 30:04.022
Should we give it a taste?

30:04.106 --> 30:05.807
Ah, I've got that
Chamber of Commerce thing

30:05.891 --> 30:08.244
I need to get to, but.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.112
Yeah, no, no you go.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.511
You wanna come?

30:14.595 --> 30:17.076
Your sister's gonna be there.

30:18.077 --> 30:21.210
No, it's not my world anymore, dad.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.169
Yeah.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.128
Well, it was worth a shot.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.133
I'll see you.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.059
Wish you were still here mom.

30:45.756 --> 30:46.673
Looks like you were the only one

30:46.757 --> 30:49.195
that could get through to Dad.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.161
Hey, Samantha, hey.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.772
What the heck are you doing here?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.121
Sorry.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.252
More importantly, how did you get in?

31:00.336 --> 31:01.950
Oh, I have a key,
Emily gave me a key

31:02.034 --> 31:03.255
so I can just have it from the parking.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.475
Okay, you have a key.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.172
I just wanted to give you this.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.044
Before heading over
to the chamber meeting.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.263
Chamber of Commerce meeting, you too?

31:11.347 --> 31:13.570
Must be the hot ticket in town.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.093
What?

31:15.177 --> 31:16.178
Nevermind.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.838
This is everything you
need to know about Parker.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.013
What is this?

31:22.097 --> 31:23.362
This is a dossier.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.234
This is like borderline spy craft.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.235
Dossi-what?

31:26.319 --> 31:28.280
No, no, this is everything.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.500
All the information I thought
you'd want on my stepbrother.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.501
He likes, his dislikes.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.895
Favorite movies, music, TV shows.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.070
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:35.154 --> 31:36.941
He doesn't like dogs.

31:37.025 --> 31:37.896
Yeah, no.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.030
Okay.

31:43.553 --> 31:47.734
All right, well, next time
maybe you can just email me.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.649
I should have done that.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.390
Hey, it's okay.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.392
I got some reading to do.

31:53.476 --> 31:54.829
Wait, and I gotta run.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.092
Okay, don't get lost.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.267
Yes.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.321
Hi.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.286
Sorry I'm late.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.372
It's okay, no worries.

32:23.637 --> 32:24.771
Am I too casual?

32:24.855 --> 32:26.382
Dad, you look great.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.123
These things make me so nervous.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.646
Just fine.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.737
Where were you?

32:33.821 --> 32:36.348
Oh, I had to swing by the printers.

32:36.432 --> 32:39.003
And how do they look?

32:39.087 --> 32:40.962
No, I didn't get them.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.747
I was hurrying to get here.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.093
What you got?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.229
We've been talking about this for weeks.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.230
How did you not get them?

32:48.314 --> 32:49.231
Why did you get them?

32:49.315 --> 32:50.972
Okay, welcome.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.104
And thank you for joining us, as you know,

32:53.188 --> 32:55.193
this is the final planning meeting

32:55.277 --> 32:56.803
for the Kris Kringle market

32:56.887 --> 32:58.283
and the Christmas Blender.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.285
I just wanna go through and wrap up

33:00.369 --> 33:03.245
some last minute details for both events.

33:03.329 --> 33:07.858
Please go to your
itinerary and let's review.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.378
Yes, Mr. Williams.

33:10.901 --> 33:14.734
Are you gonna announce the
prize for the wine contest?

33:14.818 --> 33:16.432
Yes, I can go ahead and do that.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.737
Yeah, let's go ahead.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.174
I know a lot of you are
very anxious about it.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.177
As you know, the winner
of the wine competition

33:22.261 --> 33:24.396
obviously is gonna have
great bragging rights

33:24.480 --> 33:28.139
and distributors be fighting
over representing your wine.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.664
However, this year, the city
is going to be giving away

33:31.748 --> 33:36.104
a very special prize to the
winner of the Christmas Blender.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.149
One acre of Norton grapes,

33:38.233 --> 33:42.066
including the planting of
the vines in the spring.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.111
Wow.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.112
That's huge.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.288
I know, I know, I know.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.808
That is huge.

33:50.680 --> 33:51.464
Wow.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.993
Of course, the red blends will be judged

33:56.077 --> 33:58.427
according to the Davis system.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.789
That is one serious price.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.237
Okay, Debbie Downer.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.673
What?

34:23.757 --> 34:25.501
Oh, no, nothing.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.460
But don't forget, there's audience voting.

34:28.544 --> 34:31.768
So I recommend you get out
there and spread Christmas cheer

34:31.852 --> 34:34.640
and you promote your wines,
so let's get back to work.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.513
Everybody look at number
one on the itinerary.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.381
Okay, booth placement.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.344
I know some of you were upset

34:42.428 --> 34:44.389
about your placement last year.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.391
Hey, great to see you too.

34:52.742 --> 34:53.743
Take this.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.312
And read the.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.105
You weren't talking to that
Hermannhof girl, were you?

35:04.189 --> 35:05.320
No, Parker.

35:06.539 --> 35:07.934
Hey honey, you ready?

35:08.018 --> 35:08.802
Let's go.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.330
Good.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.419
Because we have to
temperature check those reds.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.594
At this time of the night?

35:15.678 --> 35:17.248
Especially at this time of the night.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.118
What kind of question is that?

35:22.294 --> 35:26.953
Do you see this note
Tony wrote me, so romantic.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.433
Oh, while you're on cloud nine,

35:28.517 --> 35:30.131
I'm reading about the other guy.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.654
All right, love to hear it.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.003
What have we got?

35:33.087 --> 35:34.961
He's just, he's so oddly specific.

35:35.045 --> 35:39.227
Okay, so he likes classical
music over jazz, of course.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.489
Okay.

35:40.573 --> 35:41.925
He prefers to watch the news over sitcoms.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.318
It's a little weird.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.146
And then the worst thing that I found

35:45.230 --> 35:47.844
is that he doesn't like dogs.

35:47.928 --> 35:48.845
What?

35:48.929 --> 35:49.889
Yeah.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.413
That's an actual preference?

35:51.497 --> 35:52.501
I know.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.416
Wow, I'm sure dogs can sense that.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.071
It's crazy that someone
can be this good looking.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.767
I mean, look at him,
and then be such a jerk.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.643
So what are you gonna do about it?

36:04.727 --> 36:08.386
I am going to dazzle him, my dear sister.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.298
Of course you are.

36:11.473 --> 36:15.176
Oh, and what about
Anita's wine blender?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.134
I can only fix one problem at a time.

36:17.218 --> 36:22.180
Dad's not gonna listen to
me, so that's all I can do.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.010
Whatever you say.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.184
And where's this place?

36:37.369 --> 36:39.635
Hi, I'm here picking up
an order under Williams.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.202
Sure, lemme check on that, be right back.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.896
Cool, sounds good.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.422
Told you I'd find you.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.775
Well, hello again.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.777
Hi, nice surprise.

36:51.861 --> 36:52.778
That it is.

36:52.862 --> 36:53.779
What'd you order?

36:53.863 --> 36:56.042
I got the blue
Hawaiian burger.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.914
Makes me feel tropical when it's cold.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.394
You?

36:59.478 --> 37:00.351
The spinout.

37:00.435 --> 37:01.352
Never had that before.

37:01.436 --> 37:02.614
You should try it.

37:02.698 --> 37:03.659
Even though I thought
winemakers only eat wine

37:03.743 --> 37:06.488
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.577
Well, even when your
wine is as lovely as ours,

37:08.661 --> 37:10.535
as you can only have it in moderation.

37:10.619 --> 37:13.886
Besides, sometimes I just
need a burger, you know?

37:13.970 --> 37:14.797
Get it.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.976
So what are you doing tonight?

37:21.500 --> 37:23.331
What do you have in mind?

37:23.415 --> 37:24.720
Dinner, 1837,

37:26.766 --> 37:29.206
good food, good wine.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.121
That's my favorite spot.

37:31.205 --> 37:31.988
Is it?

37:34.339 --> 37:35.343
What time should
I pick you up?

37:35.427 --> 37:38.172
I'll meet you there, seven.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.262
It's a date.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.564
It's a date.

37:43.522 --> 37:46.571
Here you go sir, have a good day.

37:46.655 --> 37:47.877
Well, I.

37:47.961 --> 37:48.878
Yeah, same.

37:48.962 --> 37:49.745
Right.

38:07.328 --> 38:10.160
Hey Sam, I'm out to up at 1837 with Tony.

38:10.244 --> 38:13.250
I'll be back later tonight.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.044
That was phenomenal.

38:25.128 --> 38:29.179
Did the wine pairing
meet with your approval?

38:29.263 --> 38:32.443
I think you tied it all together.

38:33.441 --> 38:34.532
Very happy you liked it.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.749
So do you come here often?

38:39.012 --> 38:43.451
You know, I used to, before
we started getting busy

38:44.757 --> 38:47.415
in the early days of reserves,
my stepbrother Tony and I,

38:47.499 --> 38:48.590
we would come here and we'd have

38:48.674 --> 38:51.506
our business brainstorm sessions.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.465
What brought you to Herman?

38:54.549 --> 38:57.642
California was, is too expensive

38:57.726 --> 39:00.166
and France was out of the question.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.385
The more research I did,

39:01.469 --> 39:04.432
the more I realized
Hermann was the future.

39:04.516 --> 39:05.343
Future?

39:06.518 --> 39:10.089
Well, the future for me at least.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.045
That's a bold claim.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.572
Look, wine doesn't just happen.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.666
It exists because we choose to make it.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.886
It's no accident that the
grapes here in Hermann

39:23.970 --> 39:25.801
are less vulnerable than other places.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.455
They have to be.

39:27.539 --> 39:30.806
They don't have a choice, to
survive they need to adapt.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.548
And these people, this
place, these grapes,

39:33.632 --> 39:36.464
they all adapt to these
ever-changing environments.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.510
And in turn, they produce
something so beautiful.

39:39.594 --> 39:42.208
Something so beautiful
everyone can enjoy of age.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.165
But I think the same applies to us.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.522
We always have an opportunity
to overcome something

39:51.606 --> 39:55.654
difficult in order to
create something beautiful.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.355
Wow, that was amazing.

40:04.532 --> 40:09.537
I can imagine being vulnerable
is difficult for you.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.413
You know, you're starting
to sound like my stepbrother.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.762
Are you guys close?

40:13.846 --> 40:17.418
Very, we're practically
attached at the hip.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.724
Look, I would never say this to his face,

40:19.808 --> 40:21.984
I couldn't live without him.

40:23.421 --> 40:28.077
He's everything I'm not,
thoughtful, sensitive, friendly.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.997
And for some reason he puts up with me.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.303
You're not that bad.

40:33.387 --> 40:36.695
I have a sister too, she's pretty amazing.

40:37.609 --> 40:38.436
Yeah.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.704
To our siblings.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.401
To our siblings.

40:55.104 --> 40:56.282
You all right?

40:56.366 --> 40:57.106
Yeah.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.416
Was there a cork in your wine?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.504
No, no, no, please.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.463
I'll go, I'll talk to them.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.247
I'll talk to the, you just sit there,

41:04.331 --> 41:05.770
can I get you anything?

41:05.854 --> 41:06.684
Yeah.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.988
That's my favorite part.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.950
I just love the way that they cook it.

41:12.034 --> 41:12.951
What are you doing here?

41:13.035 --> 41:13.952
I'm having dinner with Tony.

41:14.036 --> 41:14.953
In a public place?

41:15.037 --> 41:15.954
What's the problem?

41:16.038 --> 41:16.955
You didn't get my note.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.522
What note?

41:18.606 --> 41:19.175
The note that said I'm
taking Parker here tonight.

41:19.259 --> 41:20.176
Parker's here?

41:20.260 --> 41:21.177
Yes.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.178
Oh, no.

41:22.262 --> 41:23.179
Oh yes.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.223
I'll pull the fire alarm.

41:24.307 --> 41:25.486
No, no, no, no.

41:25.570 --> 41:26.704
Don't, don't pull the fire alarm.

41:26.788 --> 41:27.618
What's gonna happen when he sees us,

41:27.702 --> 41:28.880
you're gonna loose your shares.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.273
Okay just relax, I will run interference.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.014
You guys go to the door,
but you have to be careful.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.856
Welcome back, what's this?

41:47.940 --> 41:49.248
Just a free glass of sherry

41:49.332 --> 41:51.773
for the cork we found in the last one.

41:51.857 --> 41:52.817
Nice work.

41:52.901 --> 41:53.731
Thank you.

41:53.815 --> 41:55.080
Love me a good dessert wine.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.122
Ooh, sherry.

41:59.255 --> 42:01.478
The lightest and most dryable cherries

42:01.562 --> 42:03.695
with nutty and tart flavors.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.089
How do you like it?

42:10.919 --> 42:12.617
I love this song.

42:15.228 --> 42:16.751
Me too, me too.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.453
Is that a jukebox?

42:19.537 --> 42:20.584
You wanna dance with me?

42:20.668 --> 42:21.539
What, no.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.543
So stiff, so stiff.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.723
♪ Mistletoe

42:34.639 --> 42:37.598
Got him to dance, that's not good.

42:38.860 --> 42:39.905
Yeah.

42:45.475 --> 42:49.871
♪ First on my
Christmas list is you ♪

42:57.052 --> 42:58.579
I can't believe you got me to do that.

42:58.663 --> 42:59.841
You got some moves.

42:59.925 --> 43:02.931
I didn't wanna go that
far, but it was fun,

43:03.015 --> 43:04.149
I'll give you that.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.411
I'm just glad nobody recorded that.

43:05.495 --> 43:06.761
Oh, you didn't see me recording it?

43:06.845 --> 43:07.762
Don't even.

43:09.195 --> 43:10.634
Jerk.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.810
I guess my dreams of
running for public office

43:12.894 --> 43:14.374
are out the window.

43:15.505 --> 43:16.289
Tough.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.469
I had a really good time.

43:20.554 --> 43:21.515
Yeah, I did too.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.735
But it's, it's getting late, so.

43:24.819 --> 43:25.780
Yeah.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.822
You wanna do this again?

43:35.830 --> 43:37.835
How about this weekend?

43:37.919 --> 43:38.967
This weekend.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.838
I have to go to this Christmas party

43:40.922 --> 43:44.752
and I was wondering if
you'd be my plus one.

43:45.797 --> 43:46.972
Plus one, huh?

43:48.277 --> 43:49.934
You know what I mean.

43:50.018 --> 43:51.370
Okay.

43:51.454 --> 43:52.415
Come on, it'll be fun.

43:52.499 --> 43:54.936
Everyone will be there, please?

43:56.416 --> 43:58.160
Okay, yeah.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.727
Yeah.

43:59.811 --> 44:02.077
Great, the Chamber of
Commerce director's having,

44:02.161 --> 44:04.209
and so all the top
winemakers will be there.

44:04.293 --> 44:06.908
The folks from Bancroft,
Ashbury, Cloud Wine.

44:06.992 --> 44:08.562
I'm sure even
Hermannhof will pop in,

44:08.646 --> 44:11.260
they are the legacy winery.

44:11.344 --> 44:12.566
Hermannhof.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.045
Yeah, you ever tried them?

44:14.129 --> 44:18.307
The folks I get my grapes
from, but be quite honest,

44:19.787 --> 44:21.357
I miss how much longer they'll be around.

44:21.441 --> 44:24.186
I didn't know it was that bad.

44:24.270 --> 44:25.404
What's that?

44:25.488 --> 44:26.838
That sounds bad.

44:27.969 --> 44:30.192
Yeah, it is what it is.

44:30.276 --> 44:31.541
Things change.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.846
I wish them the best,
but that's you, right?

44:36.674 --> 44:38.023
Yeah, that's me.

44:41.026 --> 44:44.249
So I'll see you Saturday,
I'll pick you up 6:30.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.338
I'll meet you there.

44:46.422 --> 44:49.690
What, I'm still getting to know you, so.

44:49.774 --> 44:50.557
Okay.

44:52.951 --> 44:54.303
Good night, Samantha.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.044
Good night, Parker.

45:06.486 --> 45:08.970
And how could you be so careless?

45:09.054 --> 45:12.147
I don't know, Parker doesn't
eat there very much anymore.

45:12.231 --> 45:13.539
At his favorite spot.

45:13.623 --> 45:14.845
To be fair, Tony says

45:14.929 --> 45:17.021
he mostly just does delivery these days.

45:17.105 --> 45:19.284
It's really hard to yell
at you when you're eating

45:19.368 --> 45:21.635
all of these Christmas cookies.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.502
So good.

45:24.112 --> 45:26.857
Guess I'll just have to
make more of them then.

45:26.941 --> 45:29.204
You want me to help, right?

45:31.511 --> 45:33.951
Did I ever do to deserve you?

45:34.035 --> 45:35.471
I am not worthy.

45:37.256 --> 45:38.739
Aside from your dramatic love life,

45:38.823 --> 45:41.611
I think we have some bigger fish to fry.

45:41.695 --> 45:42.478
What?

45:43.697 --> 45:45.354
Has dad told you how the winery's doing?

46:00.758 --> 46:02.020
Good morning.

46:02.934 --> 46:04.329
Good morning.

46:04.413 --> 46:07.028
You're in an awfully good mood today.

46:07.112 --> 46:07.895
Am I?

46:09.114 --> 46:11.946
Did you like the labels from the printer?

46:12.030 --> 46:13.512
The labels, yeah, they were great.

46:13.596 --> 46:15.471
You're happy with them?

46:15.555 --> 46:16.774
No, I'm not.

46:18.688 --> 46:19.649
Of course.

46:19.733 --> 46:20.868
Well, lemme guess.

46:20.952 --> 46:22.391
Did you dream up a new blend last night?

46:22.475 --> 46:23.697
Nope.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.915
You yelled at the cable provider

46:24.999 --> 46:26.830
and you got to keep
the introductory prize.

46:26.914 --> 46:28.916
No, but good reminder.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.095
Seems impossible, but you met a girl.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.058
Maybe.

46:37.142 --> 46:38.233
I knew it.

46:38.317 --> 46:39.451
For knowing it, you got it wrong twice.

46:39.535 --> 46:40.626
I won't forget about
that, tell me about her.

46:40.710 --> 46:41.845
Who is she, what's her name?

46:41.929 --> 46:43.064
I don't gossip.

46:43.148 --> 46:44.021
Come on.

46:44.105 --> 46:45.150
Sorry.

46:46.368 --> 46:47.546
If you want come meet her

46:47.630 --> 46:51.072
at the Christmas party this weekend.

46:51.156 --> 46:51.939
Yes.

47:00.469 --> 47:01.473
Hey dad.

47:01.557 --> 47:02.736
Yeah.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.169
We need to talk.

47:15.658 --> 47:16.529
Let's go.

47:22.361 --> 47:24.801
Well, I didn't wanna
have this conversation.

47:24.885 --> 47:27.456
Clearly, I work here
and I didn't even know

47:27.540 --> 47:29.240
what was going on.

47:29.324 --> 47:30.938
How bad is it Dad?

47:31.022 --> 47:35.069
The short version, our
overhead is too high.

47:36.375 --> 47:40.164
The costs to plant, tend to
the vines process the grapes,

47:40.248 --> 47:43.385
this bottling machine keeps breaking down.

47:43.469 --> 47:44.647
If there's stuff weighing us down,

47:44.731 --> 47:47.212
we should just get rid of it.

47:48.778 --> 47:51.262
If we could just win this contest.

47:51.346 --> 47:52.437
The Christmas Blender.

47:52.521 --> 47:54.523
Yeah, if we could win,

47:56.003 --> 47:59.314
it would lower our growing
costs and increase our sales.

47:59.398 --> 48:00.881
Why don't we just solve part of the winery

48:00.965 --> 48:02.273
and the equipment?

48:02.357 --> 48:03.144
There's nothing wrong with
going to a third party

48:03.228 --> 48:05.102
if our costs are too high.

48:05.186 --> 48:09.451
No, I'm not gonna change
the way we do business.

48:10.931 --> 48:14.195
Now we are a legacy
winery from seeds to Cork.

48:15.109 --> 48:16.200
Sam.

48:16.284 --> 48:17.506
She might be onto something.

48:17.590 --> 48:19.247
And and when did you become an expert

48:19.331 --> 48:22.032
at growingand selling wine?

48:22.116 --> 48:23.117
Dad, stop.

48:24.771 --> 48:26.907
I don't know, maybe
'cause I've been around it

48:26.991 --> 48:28.166
my whole life.

48:29.384 --> 48:30.911
I love you, dad.

48:30.995 --> 48:34.915
But you are using Christmas
blends from mom from years ago.

48:34.999 --> 48:36.090
And you're not innovating.

48:36.174 --> 48:40.007
You're imitating, and that's the problem.

48:40.091 --> 48:41.922
And guess what?

48:42.006 --> 48:44.228
None of it brings mom back

48:44.312 --> 48:46.927
and you are running this
winery into the ground.

48:47.011 --> 48:47.971
That's enough.

48:48.055 --> 48:51.192
Okay, look, I love you both.

48:51.276 --> 48:52.454
I'm not trying to choose sides here,

48:52.538 --> 48:55.976
but honestly I think
Sam's on to something.

48:58.065 --> 49:01.158
Look, let me just help
with the Christmas Blender.

49:01.242 --> 49:02.203
I think I have some really good ideas.

49:02.287 --> 49:03.291
I can surprise the judges.

49:03.375 --> 49:06.247
No, and this conversation is over.

49:09.424 --> 49:10.951
Now if you two will, excuse me,

49:11.035 --> 49:14.038
there's work to be done around here.

49:18.738 --> 49:20.221
It didn't go too well.

49:20.305 --> 49:21.480
It never does.

49:27.834 --> 49:29.752
Are you sure he is gonna be there?

49:29.836 --> 49:32.233
Yes, okay, Tony already text me

49:32.317 --> 49:34.061
and he said that him and
Parker are on their way.

49:34.145 --> 49:35.540
So we gotta get a move on.

49:35.624 --> 49:37.281
I felt bad pretending to be festive

49:37.365 --> 49:38.630
when dad's in the cellar stewing.

49:38.714 --> 49:39.980
He's not stewing.

49:40.064 --> 49:42.504
He's just doing his grumbling Dad thing.

49:42.588 --> 49:43.809
Come on, let's go.

49:49.856 --> 49:52.209
Welcome everyone to the city of Hermann's

49:52.293 --> 49:55.125
annual Christmas tree lighting.

49:59.387 --> 50:00.478
Are you ready?

50:00.562 --> 50:01.827
Yes.

50:01.911 --> 50:04.091
Let's start the countdown.

50:04.175 --> 50:06.307
10, nine, eight, seven.

50:09.528 --> 50:11.794
Tall enough to the tree, huh?

50:11.878 --> 50:14.402
Three, two, one.

50:21.757 --> 50:23.501
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

50:23.585 --> 50:25.587
You too. Mr. Williams.

50:41.429 --> 50:42.694
Busted.

50:42.778 --> 50:43.957
What?

50:44.041 --> 50:45.088
Looks like you're enjoying

50:45.172 --> 50:47.090
our Hermann Christmas celebrations.

50:47.174 --> 50:48.483
You caught me.

50:48.567 --> 50:50.093
Maybe you'll stay a little longer.

50:50.177 --> 50:51.529
Maybe.

50:51.613 --> 50:54.619
I do love small towns,
especially during the holidays.

50:54.703 --> 50:56.230
Well, in that case, could I interest you

50:56.314 --> 50:58.232
in some mulled wine?

50:58.316 --> 50:59.233
Sure.

51:04.539 --> 51:05.500
I think it's working.

51:05.584 --> 51:06.544
It looks like it.

51:06.628 --> 51:07.676
You wanna get outta here?

51:07.760 --> 51:08.761
Let's go.

51:10.763 --> 51:14.639
So I'd really love to know more about you.

51:14.723 --> 51:16.380
Right, well, you know I love wine.

51:16.464 --> 51:18.339
Yep, cheers to that.

51:18.423 --> 51:21.255
You know I love small towns.

51:21.339 --> 51:22.256
Clearly.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.561
And I love Christmas.

51:23.645 --> 51:26.086
What else else do you wanna know?

51:26.170 --> 51:27.696
Okay, well, will you be spending Christmas

51:27.780 --> 51:29.741
with your family?

51:29.825 --> 51:31.178
Where are they, where did you grow up?

51:31.262 --> 51:32.614
I mean, I don't even know your last name.

51:32.698 --> 51:33.658
You need to know my last name.

51:33.742 --> 51:36.618
You could spare no details.

51:36.702 --> 51:39.142
I'm just on a little
break from work right now.

51:39.226 --> 51:42.189
And as far as the holidays go,

51:42.273 --> 51:45.670
my mom passed seven years ago, so.

51:45.754 --> 51:46.932
Gotcha.

51:47.016 --> 51:49.370
It's just never the same without her.

51:49.454 --> 51:50.936
What about you?

51:51.020 --> 51:55.460
Well, growing up my dad was
in the military and widowed.

51:56.330 --> 51:57.769
So Christmas was kind of rough.

51:57.853 --> 52:00.291
But then he met my mom, stepmom,

52:01.422 --> 52:03.906
Tony's mom and things got much better.

52:03.990 --> 52:06.952
She made sure Christmas was
always very special for us.

52:07.036 --> 52:10.608
It must have been hard without your mom.

52:10.692 --> 52:13.391
Yeah, but Tony's mom is my mom.

52:15.306 --> 52:16.223
I love that.

52:16.307 --> 52:17.177
Yeah, so.

52:20.485 --> 52:22.794
I hate to drink and run.

52:22.878 --> 52:23.578
Then don't.

52:23.662 --> 52:24.361
I have to.

52:24.445 --> 52:25.580
No, you don't, stay.

52:25.664 --> 52:27.147
I can't.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.626
Well, can I walk you

52:28.710 --> 52:30.585
to your hotel or your car
or wherever you're going?

52:30.669 --> 52:33.414
No, I'm good, I appreciate it though.

52:33.498 --> 52:35.198
Well, don't forget about tomorrow.

52:35.282 --> 52:36.286
What's tomorrow?

52:38.677 --> 52:40.334
I won't even joke
around like that, please?

52:40.418 --> 52:42.858
I'm kidding, I'll meet you there.

52:42.942 --> 52:44.251
Seven.

52:44.335 --> 52:45.423
See you then.

53:29.380 --> 53:30.819
Maybe I did.

53:30.903 --> 53:31.686
You.

53:33.514 --> 53:37.217
Thank you, you look
pretty nice yourself there.

53:37.301 --> 53:39.828
And that wouldn't be such
a bad thing wouldn't?

53:39.912 --> 53:42.393
Hey Dad, you're looking nice.

53:44.395 --> 53:48.663
In my day this was just a
sweater, not an ugly sweater.

53:48.747 --> 53:52.449
My opinion, if there was
a contest, you would win.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.321
There you are.

53:54.405 --> 53:57.498
Oh my, I did not know
you wore nice clothes.

53:57.582 --> 53:59.413
Didn't, I just bought this.

53:59.497 --> 54:01.502
Oh, you just bought this.

54:01.586 --> 54:03.457
Oh, tag is still on it.

54:04.850 --> 54:06.159
Thanks.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.722
So hoe do I look?

54:08.984 --> 54:11.294
You look like you could own a winery.

54:11.378 --> 54:13.250
I'll take it, George.

54:14.773 --> 54:16.691
How's it going?

54:16.775 --> 54:18.388
Parker, Merry Christmas.

54:18.472 --> 54:20.303
Tis' the season.

54:20.387 --> 54:21.261
How's your Christmas blend coming along?

54:21.345 --> 54:23.608
Couldn't be better, yours?

54:24.783 --> 54:26.440
It's my best to date.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.268
The judges and crowd should be pleased.

54:28.352 --> 54:30.400
I'm very excited to try yours.

54:30.484 --> 54:33.534
Wow, I'm very excited
about the grand prize.

54:33.618 --> 54:34.622
Well, don't get too excited,

54:34.706 --> 54:36.537
I'm pretty sure we have this one.

54:36.621 --> 54:38.927
Well, we'll see about that.

54:40.146 --> 54:41.411
You plan on bringing that same dull blend

54:41.495 --> 54:45.894
you brought last year
George, you're in trouble.

54:45.978 --> 54:49.547
Have a good evening, I
have to find my date.

54:51.723 --> 54:52.593
Excuse me.

54:58.295 --> 55:02.302
Who could possibly be on
a date with that narcissist?

55:02.386 --> 55:03.169
He is.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.523
Okay, Dad, look, you
promise not to get too mad.

55:13.788 --> 55:14.572
See her?

55:15.660 --> 55:16.878
No, not yet.

55:19.272 --> 55:21.582
Hope she didn't forget.

55:21.666 --> 55:22.409
Nervous?

55:22.493 --> 55:24.495
No, I'm getting nervous.

55:25.626 --> 55:27.022
Hey.

55:28.760 --> 55:30.327
Hey, is that her?

55:31.937 --> 55:32.720
Yeah.

55:37.029 --> 55:39.336
I'll leave you two alone.

55:40.989 --> 55:42.426
Wow, just wow.

55:46.255 --> 55:48.040
Hi, you look stunning.

55:49.128 --> 55:50.132
Sorry.

55:50.216 --> 55:51.655
Thank you.

55:51.739 --> 55:54.351
Do you wanna go try some wine?

55:55.526 --> 55:56.530
Yes, yes.

55:56.614 --> 55:58.488
You have to try
Alpine's newest red,

55:58.572 --> 56:00.664
it's a blend of Missouri Nord

56:00.748 --> 56:02.184
with California.

56:03.272 --> 56:05.710
Hi, two general Fremont please.

56:11.063 --> 56:11.846
Thank you.

56:14.762 --> 56:16.941
To a very merry Christmas.

56:17.025 --> 56:18.508
And a happy New Year.

56:27.775 --> 56:29.214
Wow.

56:29.298 --> 56:30.215
Wow, that's good.

56:30.299 --> 56:31.083
Right?

56:32.040 --> 56:33.128
Dark berries.

56:34.086 --> 56:35.830
Black plum.

56:35.914 --> 56:36.831
Dark chocolate.

56:36.915 --> 56:37.962
Black cherry.

56:38.046 --> 56:39.268
And a touch of liquorish.

56:39.352 --> 56:42.358
And wood showing the long finish.

56:42.442 --> 56:46.144
Wow, you really do have
an excellent palette.

56:46.228 --> 56:47.055
Thanks.

56:49.754 --> 56:52.020
You should come work for me.

56:52.104 --> 56:53.543
I can't.

56:53.627 --> 56:56.329
And plus all my passengers
need help with their carry-ons.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.634
I'm serious.

56:57.718 --> 56:59.419
Why don't you move here out?

56:59.503 --> 57:03.205
I'll hire you and you can
help me make new wines.

57:03.289 --> 57:04.424
It's really sweet,

57:04.508 --> 57:07.815
but I really don't even know what to say.

57:09.774 --> 57:11.518
Say yes.

57:11.602 --> 57:13.821
What do you have to lose?

57:16.520 --> 57:20.744
You have the talent, you
just need an opportunity.

57:20.828 --> 57:23.396
I need to go wash my hands.

57:25.267 --> 57:27.490
I will be right back.

57:36.017 --> 57:37.195
What is wrong with me?

57:37.279 --> 57:39.589
You don't actually like this guy.

57:39.673 --> 57:40.895
He's a jerk.

57:40.979 --> 57:43.767
He's a real, he's an attractive jerk.

57:43.851 --> 57:46.640
But, get it together Samantha.

57:46.724 --> 57:49.030
Why are you acting like this?

57:49.944 --> 57:51.642
He's not that cute.

57:52.730 --> 57:54.122
Everything's good.

57:55.472 --> 57:56.951
Hi, are you okay?

57:58.126 --> 58:01.347
I think I might actually like Parker.

58:03.218 --> 58:05.659
What, are you kidding me?

58:05.743 --> 58:08.397
That's awful and that's great.

58:10.399 --> 58:12.143
That's awful and great at the same time.

58:12.227 --> 58:13.710
Is it?

58:13.794 --> 58:17.061
Totally, okay, if Parker
finds out who you are

58:17.145 --> 58:19.760
then there's no way he's
gonna have a problem

58:19.844 --> 58:21.979
with Tony and I and then we can all.

58:22.063 --> 58:23.546
We can all live happily after.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.722
You make it look so easy.

58:25.806 --> 58:26.720
Trust me.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.511
And I may have already told dad

58:31.595 --> 58:32.686
about Parker and Tony anyways.

58:32.770 --> 58:33.687
Wait what?

58:33.771 --> 58:34.772
It's okay.

58:38.515 --> 58:39.475
He wasn't angry per se, just grumbly.

58:39.559 --> 58:40.476
Great.

58:40.560 --> 58:41.782
Look, Sam.

58:41.866 --> 58:43.914
Everything is gonna be
just fine, look at me.

58:43.998 --> 58:48.528
Go in there and get
yourself some true love.

58:48.612 --> 58:49.659
Thanks.

58:49.743 --> 58:50.527
Welcome.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.269
Wow.

58:58.447 --> 58:59.756
Can I please see your
after dinner drink selection?

58:59.840 --> 59:01.758
Thank you so much.

59:01.842 --> 59:02.887
Miss me?

59:04.062 --> 59:05.849
Caught me.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.634
So what is next on our taste menu?

59:07.718 --> 59:09.505
Well, I was looking at the dessert menu

59:09.589 --> 59:10.811
and I thought that could be fun.

59:10.895 --> 59:13.770
Someone likes to skip dessert I see.

59:13.854 --> 59:17.510
Sometimes I enjoy things that are sweet.

59:21.645 --> 59:25.518
You really should consider
staying in Hermann.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.872
It seems like a nice place to live.

59:28.956 --> 59:32.180
Hermann's turning into
a huge wine destination.

59:32.264 --> 59:35.879
And you would be great
in the wine business.

59:35.963 --> 59:38.012
I'm not just saying that.

59:38.096 --> 59:39.361
Look Parker,

59:39.445 --> 59:43.318
there's something that I
need to tell you that I.

59:44.755 --> 59:47.891
Your father has outdone himself this year.

59:47.975 --> 59:51.939
This Hermann Hoff Norton
is, oh, it's amazing.

59:52.023 --> 59:53.114
Your father.

59:53.198 --> 59:55.464
Hey Parker
Williams, you made it.

59:55.548 --> 59:56.813
Yeah.

59:56.897 --> 59:59.424
Be good to this one,
she's Hermannhof royalty.

59:59.508 --> 01:00:01.775
I've noticed since she was a baby.

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.211
Royalty, huh?

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:04.865
I remember her and her sister Emily,

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:06.780
running around those wine cellars,

01:00:06.864 --> 01:00:08.912
like it was their own personal playground.

01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.566
You don't say.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.782
Remember that?

01:00:15.002 --> 01:00:17.834
Oh, and her mother made
the most wonderful blends.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:19.662
You know, we're kind of sad
that you didn't get into wine.

01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:20.663
Maybe someday.

01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:22.273
Well, love the Norton.

01:00:22.357 --> 01:00:23.884
I hope you guys have a good holiday.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:26.756
I'll see you around, bye.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.497
Those cookies were to die for.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.934
Look, Parker, I can't explain.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:35.243
What's there to explain,
you're a Hermannhof?

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:36.853
I know, I tried to.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.942
Should have seen this
coming, I'm such an idiot.

01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:42.859
No wonder you knew so much about wine.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.645
No wonder you knew so much about me.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.646
I'm sorry.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.647
Wait a minute.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.907
Did Tony put you up to this?

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.000
I mean.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.825
Yes, it was my idea.

01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:01.748
Are you trying to
deliberately sink our winery?

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.706
No, I love Emily.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.708
I just wanna be happy with her.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.319
You've been dating her behind my back.

01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:09.669
You've been dating the competition.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:10.800
Yes Parker, I love her.

01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:13.931
So you're giving up your shares.

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:16.890
You can't do that.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.545
Yes, I can.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.072
We made an agreement,

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:25.249
remember that if either of
us jeopardized our winery,

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:28.426
the offending party would forfeit his.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:29.689
Yes, yes.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:30.690
Why don't you just let him be happy

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:31.691
and then maybe you be happy?

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.997
Hey, you can quit the act now.

01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:36.391
You're real great, thank
you so much for your work.

01:01:36.475 --> 01:01:38.567
But we're done here.

01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:41.309
You know what, no hard feelings,

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:46.006
let's just see who the best
winemaker in town is, huh?

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:49.880
We are done.

01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:04.027
I'm sorry.

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:19.692
I don't know, can't get
her to come out of her room.

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:25.089
Well, I can't say I blame her.

01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:29.749
Wait, are are you saying this is my fault?

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.926
She called me to come here,
come home and help her.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.233
But she was dating him
long before I got here.

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:37.365
And that's the problem.

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:39.538
That I don't come home.

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:41.888
Bingo.

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:45.678
Dad, I don't know if you know this,

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.375
but I have a job so
I can't just take off

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:48.898
massive amounts of time work.

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:51.901
But you can make an effort.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:54.991
You pop in here for a
day or two here and there

01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:56.598
and then you leave.

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:00.214
Are you really that mad at me?

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.215
Yeah.

01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:02.782
Why?

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.261
Because you're stubborn
and we're gonna lose

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:06.699
this whole thing if you
don't get with the times.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.528
Are we really gonna
argue about that again?

01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:12.966
Yeah, because you don't trust me Dad.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.576
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this,

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.057
but I'm good at making wine.

01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.449
I'm really good at it.

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:21.014
And I never said you weren't.

01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:22.973
But what?

01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:27.110
You just are never willing to change.

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:28.805
Because I can't.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.071
Because of mom.

01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:38.600
I'm so sick of you using mom as an excuse.

01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:41.298
Because even mom knew that
we have to change our blends

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:44.040
every year, depending on the harvest.

01:03:44.124 --> 01:03:46.518
And she listened to the vines.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.962
I am not gonna let go of the last thing

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:55.095
I have of your mother.

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.833
Her formula Dad,

01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:05.583
if you think that's the last
thing that represents mom,

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:09.457
you're even more lost than I thought.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.631
I don't know how to be without her.

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:15.939
And you think I do.

01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:23.297
What I do know is that
she wants us to move on

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:26.079
and she doesn't want us fighting.

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:32.390
And you wonder why I never come home Dad.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.265
I'll be gone in the morning.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.107
What were you thinking?

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:54.067
= Oh, good morning to you too.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:56.762
Why can't you let me be happy?

01:04:58.111 --> 01:04:59.115
= You can be happy.

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:00.987
You just can't take the competition.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.115
You did.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:04.904
Yeah, under false pretense.

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:07.251
So what, do you like her?

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.777
Do you like her?

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:18.352
Yes, I liked her, but
I was tricked into it.

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:21.442
So that is a false pretense.

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:24.619
Okay, listen Parker, if you like Samantha,

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:26.447
why don't we just tear up
the contracts and be happy?

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:29.189
Because that's not how this works.

01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:32.932
We signed the contract because
love makes people like us

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:34.498
make bad choices.

01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:35.935
But they're our choices to make.

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:39.939
Sure, but if you wanna
work at this winery,

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:41.154
there are rules.

01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:47.247
And dating the competition is
a flagrant violation of that.

01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:51.164
Do you understand?

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.126
I'm sorry.

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:11.709
Dad, Sam's gone and she's
not answering her phone.

01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:13.407
Yeah, I know.

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.710
What did you say to her?

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:20.066
It's not your business little one.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:24.070
Okay, Dad, whatever is going
on between the two of you,

01:06:24.154 --> 01:06:26.156
you need to work it out.

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:30.290
She wants me to change the blends.

01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:33.032
I can't do that.

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:35.295
Why?

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:39.386
Because that was mom's job?

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:47.264
Dad, you still have mom in Sam and I,

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:52.837
but I'm telling you,

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:56.229
you are gonna lose Sam
with your stubbornness.

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:01.281
Sam has been making blends for a long time

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:04.368
and she's really, really good at it.

01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:11.114
In fact, she made a red blend
and I put it in oak barrels.

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:16.296
I haven't touched it because
I wanted to surprise.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.295
Wait a minute, where?

01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:25.218
Deep in the cellar, we had
our own little secret operation

01:07:25.302 --> 01:07:27.263
and the first blends we made

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:29.526
have been there for seven years.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.829
Seven years.

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:34.702
Show me.

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:47.454
You've gotta be kidding.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:54.247
Why did she say anything?

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:57.073
She did, but you weren't listening.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:02.211
Look, dad, we will always
have our traditional wines

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:05.214
like the Norton, but
we've gotta get creative

01:08:05.298 --> 01:08:06.824
with her blends, I mean, that's why mom

01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:11.090
was changing her red
blend every single year.

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:14.177
And Sam is brilliant at making wine.

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:18.920
I think she got the gift from mom.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.275
Have you even tried any of these?

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.626
No, but I have just been saving them

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:27.712
for this very occasion.

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.203
Oh, go on.

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:53.129
Yeah, it's something right?

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:58.308
Look, dad, if we don't change,

01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:04.491
we are not gonna be competitive
with any other winery

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:07.578
and we are going to get left behind.

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:16.285
But you know what I really, truly believe

01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:19.285
is that the best way to honor mom

01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:26.162
is to simply strive to do our
best and to make the best.

01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:37.785
I think that's what she would really want.

01:09:37.869 --> 01:09:39.091
You're right.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.263
You're right.

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:44.354
Honey I am so sorry.

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:50.838
It's okay, just don't tell me, tell Sam.

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:56.670
Just tell Sam before it's too late.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.113
I'll drive.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.308
Samantha.

01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:23.309
Sam.

01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:24.310
Sam.

01:10:24.394 --> 01:10:25.572
Wait.

01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:27.400
Dad, Emily, what are you guys doing here?

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:30.530
Sam, I'm sorry about everything.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.320
Emily told me about the.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:35.930
Told you what?

01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:38.498
I told him about the
blends you made and we tasted

01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:40.369
the one you made before you moved out.

01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:43.372
Wait a minute, I thought
those were long gone guys.

01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:46.636
I stored them in oak
barrels in the cellar.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.380
Sam, your blend from seven
years ago, it's amazing.

01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.727
It's the key to this contest.

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:56.991
It's gonna save Hermannhof.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:02.435
I'm sorry that I've been
so focused in the past

01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:04.567
and not seeing the future,
but you're the future,

01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:06.218
Sam, both of you.

01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:14.534
Dad, are you sure?

01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:18.102
That red blend of yours is spectacular.

01:11:18.186 --> 01:11:22.669
You are our secret weapon
to beating reserve sellers.

01:11:26.891 --> 01:11:28.112
All right.

01:11:28.196 --> 01:11:30.376
What do you say we go bottle some wine?

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.636
Let's go bottle some wine.

01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:37.905
Let's go bottle some wine.

01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:48.695

Yes.

01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:55.347
Can I have your intention,

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:58.045
we're gonna need to tally
up those votes really soon.

01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.787
So if you haven't had a chance
to fill out your ballot,

01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:02.702
I've asked that you please go over there,

01:14:02.786 --> 01:14:05.266
taste the wines and vote, okay.

01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:08.055
As you know, the grand prize this year

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:11.493
is going to be an acre
of planted Norton grapes.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:12.581
Pretty exciting.

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:19.588
They seem to really love it.

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:20.589
You think?

01:14:20.673 --> 01:14:21.634
Did you make enough?

01:14:21.718 --> 01:14:22.809
I hope so Dad.

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:26.157
Have you tried the
Reserve Sellers in?

01:14:28.725 --> 01:14:30.117
No, I'm nervous.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:32.685
Go ahead.

01:14:34.774 --> 01:14:35.819
Great.

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:41.215
Polaris, please.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:50.834
Pretty good.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.708
I thought you'd like it.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:57.974
Hi.

01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:58.842
Hi.

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:01.325
I'm surprised you came.

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:02.718
Just supporting my family.

01:15:02.802 --> 01:15:05.112
Oh, the truth at last.

01:15:05.196 --> 01:15:09.116
Everything I told you was
the truth except that I'm.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.117
Hermannhof, yeah.

01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:11.727
I hate to break it to you,

01:15:11.811 --> 01:15:14.774
but a lie of omissions still a lie, so.

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:17.559
Look, I get you can be angry at me,

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:19.605
but what I don't get is you continuously

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:22.216
not letting Tony and
Emily be together.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.045
Well, Tony's a big boy
and he knows the rules.

01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:27.656
We're dating the competition
or you're out the winery.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.353
You're the only one competing.

01:15:29.437 --> 01:15:33.746
And nobody wins 'cause Tony
and Emily can't be together.

01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:36.448
And I would do anything
to make my sister happy.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.711
Including pretending to like me, right?

01:15:38.795 --> 01:15:39.799
Do you wanna know the truth?

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:40.887
Go for it.

01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:41.801
You seem like you know everything.

01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:42.802
You wanna know the real truth.

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:44.238
Sure, let's see.

01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:47.717
I actually started to really like you.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:53.247
Under this abrasive personality

01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:56.856
was someone that I started to care about.

01:15:58.205 --> 01:16:00.820
Loved that you loved to make
wine, but more importantly,

01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:04.516
I loved how much you
loved your stepbrother.

01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:07.827
What's your point?

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:11.047
My point is, I saw the real you.

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:12.959
It's not that scary.

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:17.268
You made a good blend.

01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:20.619
I know.

01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:22.665
Thanks.

01:16:24.275 --> 01:16:27.278
Hey, they're done with the tally.

01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:32.504
Work calls.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.633
Fine, you try my blend?

01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:40.163
It's only been sitting in
oak barrels for seven years.

01:16:40.247 --> 01:16:42.859
Goes down smoother than yours.

01:16:46.079 --> 01:16:48.781
How is that even possible?

01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:51.781
What's your favorite?

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:59.919
Excuse me, could I, one Hermannhof please.

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.725
Okay, everyone gather around.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.948
The votes have been counted

01:17:26.032 --> 01:17:30.036
and the finalists this
year are Reserve Sellers.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:39.527
And Hermannhof.

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.967
Good job.

01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:46.447
Now our two finalists

01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.275
will have to go head
to head with the judges

01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:50.973
who will make the final decision.

01:17:51.057 --> 01:17:52.975
Did you talk to Parker?

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.498
Outdid themselves.

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:55.543
Yeah.

01:17:55.627 --> 01:17:56.805
Hope we crush him.

01:17:56.889 --> 01:17:58.807
Winemakers, can I have you to the stage?

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:00.809
All the red blends were
submitted this year

01:18:00.893 --> 01:18:02.855
were so wonderful.

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.987
No, no, no, you.

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:06.989
Sam, this is your wine, you go.

01:18:07.073 --> 01:18:09.165
You're a better winemaker
than I could ever be.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:11.077
Go get up there kid.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:26.487
Sam, anything you'd like to say?

01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:28.358
Thank you everyone for being here

01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:30.230
and I hope you're having a great time

01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:32.101
at our Christmas Bender.

01:18:32.185 --> 01:18:35.275
Parker, anything you'd like to say?

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:39.453
Tip your waiters.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.243
Really, tip your waiters.

01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:48.117
Okay, it looks like Reserve
Sellers is gonna be first,

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:48.941
judges.

01:19:05.392 --> 01:19:07.003
9.5, 9.4, and 9.5.

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:17.100
That is an incredible, that's great.

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:21.800
On to the Hermannhof red blend.

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:25.938
I have a deal for you.

01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:27.287
What?

01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:30.333
It's so nice having her hop back on stage.

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:33.989
The judges seem to be discussing
the Hermannhof red blend.

01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:35.295
That's kind of unusual, okay,

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:38.907
so judges a little more
time to deliberate.

01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:40.169
Let Emily and
Tony be together,

01:19:40.253 --> 01:19:42.432
I'll forfeit the competition.

01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:44.083
You can't forfeit.

01:19:48.174 --> 01:19:49.135
I don't care about winning.

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:52.135
I just want my sister to be happy.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:09.761
Judges, 9.8.

01:20:15.549 --> 01:20:16.466
Yes.

01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:21.468
Another 9.8.

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:41.970
9.9.

01:20:42.054 --> 01:20:43.537
I'm gonna forfeit.

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.536
You deserve this, go.

01:20:50.497 --> 01:20:52.720
Sam, can you say some words?

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:55.938
Come on over, congratulations sweetie.

01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:07.343
For as long as I can remember,

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:10.778
I have always wanted to be a winemaker.

01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:17.876
My mother, my father,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.789
and my sister are all
reasons why I love wine.

01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:29.232
Girls.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.190
Sam, Emily.

01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:35.110
Mom, the lights went out.

01:21:35.194 --> 01:21:37.243
I didn't know the two of
you were still in here.

01:21:37.327 --> 01:21:39.985
Don't worry, Sam was looking out for me.

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:42.248
That's what big sisters are for.

01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:44.163
I'll always look out for you.

01:21:44.247 --> 01:21:46.339
That's right, you guys
will always have each other.

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:47.688
Okay, now listen.

01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:49.081
Do you wanna see what
I've been working on?

01:21:49.165 --> 01:21:49.948
Yeah.

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:51.907
Let's go.

01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:56.175
I'll need you both to take a deep breath

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:58.133
and then smell this, okay.

01:21:59.088 --> 01:22:01.006
What do you smell?

01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:01.917
Wine.

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.310
Anything else Sam?

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:08.404
Cherry.

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:09.794
Plum, cinnamon.

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.670
Very good Sam, you're
gonna be a better winemaker

01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:16.235
than me and your dad someday.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.067
I'm a fifth generation winemaker

01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:23.590
and I couldn't be more proud
to stand up here today.

01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:26.205
So I just wanna say thank you everyone

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:29.945
and I hope you guys all
have a happy holiday.

01:22:38.344 --> 01:22:39.432
Any comments?

01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:51.096
Samantha's right,

01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:55.799
Christmas is a time for joy and love

01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:59.148
and helping those closest to us be happy.

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.304
Congratulations Hermannhof.

01:23:22.388 --> 01:23:24.956
Wait Parker, wait, hold on.

01:23:39.797 --> 01:23:41.062
Good job honey.

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:42.278
Thanks dad.

01:23:43.105 --> 01:23:45.716
I want you to have this, here.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:55.595
But why?

01:23:56.509 --> 01:23:58.729
I don't need it anymore.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.731
Go get him.

01:24:02.776 --> 01:24:03.647
Go get him.

01:24:06.128 --> 01:24:08.521
You hold this from your dad?

01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:14.052
Your mom would be so proud of you.

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:15.441
I love you dad.

01:24:16.877 --> 01:24:18.404
I love you too.

01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:22.799
I think there's someone
I need to go find.

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.363
Go get him, go.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:30.282
Dad is there anything
you have to do as well?

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:36.071
This is amazing.

01:24:47.299 --> 01:24:49.258
You looking for someone?

01:24:50.998 --> 01:24:52.394
Yeah.

01:24:52.478 --> 01:24:54.875
Sorry, it was just a lot in there.

01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:56.398
It was.

01:24:56.482 --> 01:24:58.400
Congratulations.

01:24:58.484 --> 01:25:00.185
I tasted your wine.

01:25:00.269 --> 01:25:01.313
And?

01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:09.104
And it was by far one of the
best things I've ever tasted.

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:13.456
It was so smooth and bold and perfect.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.069
Just like you.

01:25:22.552 --> 01:25:26.211
Parker, I should have
told you so many things.

01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:28.909
Hey, look, if Tony can
date the competition,

01:25:28.993 --> 01:25:30.824
why can't I, right?

01:25:30.908 --> 01:25:32.913
It's only fair.

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:34.259
It's only fair.

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:39.699
But I'm traveling and
I don't live here.

01:25:41.005 --> 01:25:43.532
Let's face it, your heart's in Hermann,

01:25:43.616 --> 01:25:46.489
your family's here.
I'm here, stay.

01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:54.369
Besides, I don't think I could wait

01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:58.634
another seven years to try a
surprise blend from you again.

01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:00.419
So it's the only reason why you want me

01:26:00.503 --> 01:26:03.158
to stay because of my winemaking.

01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:05.769
Not just,

01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:14.259
maybe I'll take you up on your job offer.

01:26:14.343 --> 01:26:18.303
Think I could pencil
you in for an interview.

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.659
Merry Christmas Sam.

01:26:28.226 --> 01:26:30.101
Merry Christmas Parker.
