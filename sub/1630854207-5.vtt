39:43.548 --> 39:45.215
- Define loopy.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.749
- We caught her talking
to herself,

39:46.818 --> 39:48.484
Like full-on conversation.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.352
Like she was talking
to the air.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.288
- Debating the air, really.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.791
Is 40 too young for dementia?
- Yeah.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.759
Yeah, it is.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.434
What is this, the 80s?
- Okay, I am super worried.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.770
- I appreciate your concern
for me.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.007
- No, dumb shit, lidia.
I'm worried about our sister.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.742
- Oh.
- What about your sister?

40:12.877 --> 40:15.578
- She's been boning that biker
and now she's gone awol.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.514
- Huh, I'm actually pretty
worried about her myself.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.851
Did that sound natural?
That felt natural.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.519
- No offence, girls,

40:23.655 --> 40:26.189
But of the three of you,
my money is on blondie...

40:26.191 --> 40:28.658
From new york.
- Brooklyn, actually.

40:28.793 --> 40:30.527
So...

40:30.662 --> 40:32.862
Funny story.

Lidia: Hi! What're you
doing here? Wait, I mean,

40:48.447 --> 40:51.214
Should a leblanc be cross
pollinating with marauders?

40:51.216 --> 40:54.150
- Unfortunately, bees have
nothing to do with this.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.819
I just got a call from my mom
in prison,

40:56.822 --> 40:59.421

My-my brother's girlfriend.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.312
Ex-girlfriend.
Hard to keep track.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.582
- There a problem?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.918
- The 18-wheeler we boosted...

41:29.053 --> 41:30.986
Was a leblanc truck.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.923
- That is a problem.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.925
I mean, I'm new to the crime
thing, but crystal says

41:35.961 --> 41:38.394
We may have unintentionally
started a turf war.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.063

"boosted" and "turf war"

41:41.099 --> 41:42.598
Like a pro. (chuckles)

41:44.836 --> 41:48.271
- Wait, you knew
it was a leblanc truck?

41:48.340 --> 41:51.274
- The business I had in uh,
new brunswick.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.209
Chapter's looking to expand

41:53.344 --> 41:55.778
And with the leblanc's
matriarch in prison,

41:55.780 --> 41:57.647
Foxton's up for grabs.

you might have shared with me

41:59.818 --> 42:01.584
Before dragging me into this?

42:01.653 --> 42:04.086
- I didn't drag you
into anything. You volunteered.

42:04.088 --> 42:07.156
(shocked exhale)
- gale... Oh, my god.

42:08.826 --> 42:10.893
I just need to pay
my family's tax bill.

this is a lot to process.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.764

42:14.833 --> 42:16.299
So, what now?

42:16.434 --> 42:19.369
- Well, these things don't
usually end in hugs.

42:19.371 --> 42:21.237
There will be some retaliation.

will calm down. Eventually.
