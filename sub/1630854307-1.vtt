WEBVTT

02:09.988 --> 02:12.840
you'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

02:13.770 --> 02:17.750
But let's not kid ourselves,
you had your 15 minutes,

02:17.750 --> 02:21.473
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.400
Bonsoir, mon ami.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.683
Just thought I'd stop by.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.390
Well, enough chit chat.

03:29.390 --> 03:31.410
You know why I'm here, Thibaut.

03:31.410 --> 03:32.243
Do I?

03:33.110 --> 03:34.910
As president of the skating union,

03:34.910 --> 03:37.520
having to tell those past their prime

03:37.520 --> 03:39.050
that they're past their prime

03:39.050 --> 03:41.890
is one of the least
saddest parts of my job.

03:41.890 --> 03:44.923
Saddest, I meant saddest. What did I say?

03:45.830 --> 03:46.750
Are we done?

03:46.750 --> 03:48.370
Let's be clear here, Frenchie.

03:48.370 --> 03:52.940
I strongly advise you to end
your skating career yourself,

03:52.940 --> 03:55.670
ASAP, because if you don't,

03:55.670 --> 03:57.723
I will personally make sure you regret-

03:57.723 --> 03:58.973
Oh shit, the soup.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.850
So as I was saying, I
will personally make sure

04:09.850 --> 04:12.092
that you regret-
Here, hold this.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.300
What was I saying?

04:19.040 --> 04:22.210
Thanks.
Yeah, uh-huh.

04:22.210 --> 04:25.190
Look, there, there's no
need to tell me all this.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.223
See, I disagree.

04:27.180 --> 04:28.013
If it were up to you,

04:28.013 --> 04:31.730
you'd cling to your joke of a
career until the sun goes out.

04:31.730 --> 04:35.020
But let's not kid ourselves,
you had your 15 minutes,

04:35.020 --> 04:39.410
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

04:39.410 --> 04:43.963
You are old news. And old news
goes out with the garbage.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.333
You see this soup?

04:58.260 --> 05:00.343
Well, you can't have any.

05:14.045 --> 05:16.738
Oh, what a beautiful thing

05:16.738 --> 05:18.988
To leave a gloomy place

05:20.113 --> 05:22.879
For Paris, beautiful Paris

05:24.204 --> 05:26.720
which love must have created one day

05:55.370 --> 05:56.203
Oh, ffff-

05:58.290 --> 06:01.453
Most film teachers think mainstream,

06:03.040 --> 06:07.790
but those teachers are
not Professor Steve.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.040
See, Professor Steve thinks visionary.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.450
And that is why we're going to skip over

06:11.450 --> 06:14.680
these very nice mainstream folks.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.900
And instead focus on the works

06:15.900 --> 06:18.463
of one quietly brilliant modern master:

06:19.850 --> 06:21.299
Professor Steve.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.603
Sorry.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.043
Actually, dudes and dudettes,

06:32.220 --> 06:36.070
Professor Steve has changed his mind.

06:36.070 --> 06:38.420
Let's all break out our short
scripts we wrote last week

06:38.420 --> 06:41.880
because it's time for
another rousing round of

06:44.430 --> 06:45.370
peer

06:49.750 --> 06:51.073
critique.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.750
Hmm.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.940
Now, of course, we don't have
time to critique everybody.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.110
So instead, let's just
spotlight one very lucky person.

07:05.110 --> 07:07.483
Claire, how about you?

07:08.500 --> 07:11.960
Now, remember, people, we are
not here to attack Claire,

07:11.960 --> 07:16.960
but to guide her, to inspire
her, to shape her as a writer.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.303
Wilson?

07:19.350 --> 07:22.460
Yeah, so, Claire, this
isn't to attack you,

07:22.460 --> 07:25.870
but to inspire you and
shape you as a writer.

07:25.870 --> 07:28.743
Um, I just feel like
your script didn't, like,

07:29.730 --> 07:31.983
convey the human experience.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.000
That's because it's
about a talking tapeworm.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:37.180 --> 07:42.123
This is not an arguing space,
this is a growing space.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.623
Wilson, please continue.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.740
And quite frankly, it
could use more minorities.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.666
Ooh.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.335
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

07:53.335 --> 07:54.270
Mm, mm.

07:54.270 --> 07:56.638
Unpack that for me. Yes.

07:58.471 --> 08:01.700
I felt that there was a lack
of a true political voice

08:01.700 --> 08:02.760
from the tapeworm.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.162
I found that deficit to be, frankly, sad.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.170
I feel like the tapeworm comes
from a place of privilege.

08:11.170 --> 08:15.157
Is the tapeworm willing to
examine his privilege, Claire?

08:15.157 --> 08:16.260
I mean,

08:16.260 --> 08:17.093
I just feel like a tapeworm

08:17.093 --> 08:19.320
wouldn't say this stuff in real life.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.872
Unpack that for me.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.640
Okay, everybody.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.330
Thank you, thank you. Very rich remarks.

08:27.330 --> 08:28.480
Now, for your next assignment,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.910
you are going to make your own films.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.713
Yes, that's right, you're
going to make art, art.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.793
Like Professor Steve before you.

08:39.580 --> 08:40.430
Only not as good.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.390
I figured out my film
genre: puppet Greek tragedy.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.580
So it'll be "Oedipus," but with puppets.

08:49.580 --> 08:50.910
I call it: "Oedipuppet."

08:50.910 --> 08:53.010
Oh, so cute.

08:53.010 --> 08:53.843
Can I be in it?

08:53.843 --> 08:56.643
Yeah, actually, I was
thinking of you for Oedipus.

08:58.060 --> 09:00.740
Oh my God, Claire,
doesn't he murder his dad,

09:00.740 --> 09:04.060
and have sex with his mom, and
gouge his eyes out, and die?

09:04.060 --> 09:05.220
Yeah.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.450
Cute, I'm in.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.750
Seriously, though, can't
believe your professor

09:08.750 --> 09:10.878
signed off on this,
how'd you convince him?

09:12.110 --> 09:15.200
Whoa, Claire, did you even tell him?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.400
Oh my God, don't you
care about your grade?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.340
Mm, he'll come around,

09:20.340 --> 09:22.550
or not. And I'll get an F,
and flunk out of college,

09:22.550 --> 09:24.340
and spend the rest of my
life cleaning toilets.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.840
Ew! Don't talk about
toilets, toilets are gross.

09:28.104 --> 09:29.373
You know what you need?

09:30.330 --> 09:31.190
Get laid?

09:31.190 --> 09:34.120
No, but yes, but I mean realistically,

09:34.120 --> 09:37.030
you need to go to Paris.

09:37.030 --> 09:40.420
I can't just drop
everything and go to Paris.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.900
Sure you can, Claire.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.200
Like, all you've ever talked
about since middle school,

09:44.200 --> 09:47.290
is the poems of Apollinaire,
the history of the catacombs,

09:47.290 --> 09:49.180
the entire "AstÃ©rix" series.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.200
No wonder you're still a virgin.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.740
You are very loud.
But, seriously,

09:52.740 --> 09:54.560
you've worked so hard for this.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.930
You literally taught yourself
French when you were a kid.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.763
You should go.

09:58.763 --> 10:01.350
We should both go,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.150
make it a party.

10:03.150 --> 10:04.780
Unlike you, I would have to withdraw

10:04.780 --> 10:07.100
my entire college fund in order to go.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.104
So what?

10:08.104 --> 10:10.083
It's not like you're getting
anything outta college.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.951
It's a crazy idea, though.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.290
We don't even know anyone in Paris.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.800
Sure we do, my Uncle Antoine lives there.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.050
Really?
Mm-hmm.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.180
Yeah, he's the head

10:26.180 --> 10:28.560
of like this puppet conservatory in Paris.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.880
Your uncle is the head

10:29.880 --> 10:31.607
of Le Conservatoire de la Marionnette,

10:31.607 --> 10:33.117
and you never told me?

10:33.117 --> 10:34.393
You never asked.

10:36.290 --> 10:39.640
Well, I just need to
get through this class

10:39.640 --> 10:43.700
and this professor, and
then I'll figure it out.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.620
Follow your gut, Claire.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.990
If you wanna go to
Paris, then go to Paris.

10:48.990 --> 10:52.160
If you wanna make Oedipuppet,
then make Oedipuppet,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.340
because life is far too short

10:54.340 --> 10:57.343
and true passion is far too rare.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.830
How did you get so wise?

11:01.830 --> 11:02.680
I talk to Yoda.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.560
He lives in my closet,
and when I touch his hand,

11:07.560 --> 11:10.320
I ask him questions,
and he gives me answers.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.010
Maybe I should try it sometime.

11:12.010 --> 11:15.060
Yeah, but you should
probably get your own.

11:15.060 --> 11:17.080
I don't let just anybody touch my Yoda.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.653
He's in his original box.

11:23.540 --> 11:26.080
Okay, let's do one last take.

11:26.080 --> 11:30.040
Oedipuppet, gouging out
the eyes, take four.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.580
Roll camera

11:31.580 --> 11:32.670
and

11:33.620 --> 11:34.795
action.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.710
Oh ye gods!

11:36.710 --> 11:38.390
I am ruined!

11:38.390 --> 11:40.320
For my wretched sins

11:40.320 --> 11:42.488
I rip out mine eyes!

11:56.921 --> 11:58.640
For my wretched sins

11:58.640 --> 12:02.687
I rip out mine eyes!

12:20.090 --> 12:22.410
I'm sorry, Claire, I
can't raise your grade.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.960
To do so would be to compromise

12:23.960 --> 12:26.590
the rigorous standards of Professor Steve.

12:26.590 --> 12:28.600
I didn't ask you to raise my grade.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.490
I asked why you're saying
my work isn't honest.

12:31.490 --> 12:36.023
Oh, Claire, Claire, Claire,
Claire, Claire, Claire.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.720
How do I explain honesty?

12:38.720 --> 12:40.860
Honesty is real

12:40.860 --> 12:44.120
and honest.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.000
You saw Wilson's movie today, right?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.110
Now that was an honest work,

12:49.110 --> 12:51.420
a heartfelt account of
his turbulent upbringing

12:51.420 --> 12:54.773
as a Cambodian child under
the merciless Bic Pen regime.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.730
You do realize Wilson is a lacrosse player

12:58.730 --> 13:00.223
from Greenwich, right?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.600
And

13:02.600 --> 13:03.433
white.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.670
Professor Steve chooses to ignore you.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.270
Well, if I can't raise this grade,

13:08.270 --> 13:10.270
I'm just worried about my GPA because...

13:13.030 --> 13:13.883
Wait a second.

13:15.733 --> 13:18.900
No, I'm not.

13:20.016 --> 13:20.849
I'm not.

13:22.570 --> 13:23.623
I'm just not.

13:24.581 --> 13:26.580
Excuse me a second.

13:26.580 --> 13:27.653
I need to call Yoda.

13:31.530 --> 13:34.930
Julia, ask Yoda if we should go to Paris.

13:34.930 --> 13:36.630
Ooh, yay, hang on a sec.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.777
Yoda says, "For 800 years,
have I trained Jedi."

13:47.420 --> 13:50.167
Good enough for me!

14:25.220 --> 14:28.853
Your application is adequate.

14:30.760 --> 14:35.207
Now, tell me why you wish to
work as an au pair in Paris.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.590
Okay. Well, uh, I've never been to France,

14:38.433 --> 14:41.648
but what I've always
wanted more than anything

14:41.648 --> 14:43.098
is to live in Paris

14:44.186 --> 14:45.786
So... I think this job

14:47.025 --> 14:49.908
can help me get to know
Parisian culture better.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.134
You speak French perfectly!

14:53.134 --> 14:54.809
Thank you! I'm, uh, I'm -

14:57.010 --> 14:58.830
I'm half Belgian.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.010
Yes.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.400
Well, even so.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.810
Anyway, some family in
Paris will be very lucky

15:04.810 --> 15:06.830
to have you for an au pair.

15:06.830 --> 15:10.053
So, welcome to Babysitting Paris!

15:13.020 --> 15:14.490
Ah,

15:14.490 --> 15:17.010
but a word to the wise.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.429
Some families don't particularly like it

15:19.429 --> 15:21.839
when their au pair is
as well-educated as you.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.664
It can threaten their
fragile sense of superiority.

15:25.696 --> 15:27.979
So, you can't be too careful, you know?

15:29.173 --> 15:30.006
Wait, um, what did you ...

15:30.006 --> 15:31.680
Great, it's settled then.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.479
Welcome to Babysitting Paris.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.225
That is...

15:37.158 --> 15:39.334
...if that's truly what you want.

15:39.334 --> 15:41.459
This is the kind of decision that can

15:41.459 --> 15:42.659
come back to haunt you,

15:42.659 --> 15:44.578
if you see what I'm saying.

15:44.578 --> 15:46.060
My God...

15:46.060 --> 15:47.790
To look at your young face

15:49.290 --> 15:52.133
and your supple, youthful skin.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.589
...knowing full well that
in three months' time

15:55.589 --> 15:57.243
you'll come back prematurely aged

15:57.243 --> 15:58.826
and wrinkled like a prune,

15:58.826 --> 16:00.367
with a permanent twitch.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.522
Uh, sorry, would you mind repea--

16:03.522 --> 16:04.780
I didn't say anything.

16:04.780 --> 16:07.520
Right, so I have other applicants to see,

16:07.520 --> 16:08.670
how will you be paying?

16:16.950 --> 16:17.783
Excuse me?

16:19.820 --> 16:24.110
You, you dropped this,
this receipt from, uh,

16:24.110 --> 16:25.899
Babysitting Paris.

16:25.899 --> 16:28.171
Oh, thank you.

16:28.171 --> 16:29.548
You...

16:29.548 --> 16:31.170
You speak French?

16:31.170 --> 16:32.003
Uh, yes!

16:33.236 --> 16:34.327
Are you French?

16:35.217 --> 16:36.647
No, but...

16:36.647 --> 16:38.783
I'm going to France next week.

16:38.783 --> 16:39.968
It's my first time.

16:39.968 --> 16:42.304
How about you? Are you from France?

16:42.304 --> 16:43.816
Yeah, from Lyon.

16:43.816 --> 16:45.732
Lyon! That's where Guignol is from.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.298
How do you know about Guignol?

16:49.298 --> 16:52.810
Funny for an American to
know about a French puppet.

16:52.810 --> 16:54.166
Well, uh, I like puppets!

16:54.166 --> 16:55.044
I do too.

16:55.044 --> 16:56.727
I mean, when you're from Lyon

16:56.727 --> 16:58.411
It's pretty much required.

16:58.411 --> 17:00.355
You live here in New York?

17:00.355 --> 17:01.645
Yeah.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.221
Well...

17:03.221 --> 17:04.908
...not anymore, after this week.

17:04.908 --> 17:07.124
But I did live here, for four years.

17:08.053 --> 17:09.907
I was training for figure skating.

17:09.907 --> 17:11.543
Oh, you skate?

17:11.543 --> 17:12.454
Yeah.

17:12.454 --> 17:13.287
I mean...

17:14.374 --> 17:15.627
No.

17:15.627 --> 17:18.444
Well, actually... it's complicated, but...

17:18.444 --> 17:20.289
...oh, that's my ride.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.789
- Ah. Oh, no.
- Um.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.336
Oh, okay.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.754
Uh.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.870
...See you soon!

18:36.640 --> 18:37.780
Okay, Paris question.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.430
Where do you think is
best to rent an apartment:

18:39.430 --> 18:41.630
La Rive Gauche or La Rive Droite?

18:41.630 --> 18:44.670
Of course, La Rive Gauche is
associated with bohemians,

18:44.670 --> 18:46.550
so that might be kind of iffy.

18:46.550 --> 18:49.593
Now certain places are going
to be pricier, but consider-

18:50.760 --> 18:51.730
You what?

18:51.730 --> 18:52.930
Room and board with who?

18:55.340 --> 18:57.000
Au pairing?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.610
Oh my God, Claire.

18:58.610 --> 19:02.390
No! I'd rather sell my
body, except not really

19:02.390 --> 19:04.360
because that's super
unhygienic and you know me,

19:04.360 --> 19:05.930
I'm like a super huge germophobe.

19:05.930 --> 19:07.896
But, seriously, why do this?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.921
Well, it's at least a little
cheaper than living with you.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.790
Oh, Claire.

19:14.790 --> 19:19.790
No, I didn't mean, I didn't
mean you could live with me.

19:19.930 --> 19:21.720
I need my space.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.870
You could live near me.

19:26.690 --> 19:28.950
Oh my God, Claire, you love him.

19:28.950 --> 19:29.783
No, I don't.

19:29.783 --> 19:31.047
Sure you do.

19:31.047 --> 19:32.200
Look at you.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.810
Your cheeks are flushed,
your pupils are dilated,

19:34.810 --> 19:36.610
your face looks like this,

19:36.610 --> 19:39.490
and your heartbeat is
Julio Iglesias music.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.140
Get your ear off my boob.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.800
Oh my God, Claire, you
guys should get married.

19:43.800 --> 19:44.900
I should get married to someone

19:44.900 --> 19:46.510
because I met them on the street?

19:46.510 --> 19:48.560
You'd be surprised. People
get married over less.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.810
My cousin Jenna married this guy

19:49.810 --> 19:52.420
because his flesh tones
complemented her home furnishings.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.450
How'd that work out for her?

19:53.450 --> 19:55.280
Oh, she dumped him when his tan faded.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.130
So let that be a lesson to
you before you marry rashly.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.863
Before, do you even listen to you?

20:02.570 --> 20:04.600
What? Sorry, I was so distracted.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.633
You know, your pores are huge.

20:15.350 --> 20:17.110
It's funny what moves some people,

20:17.110 --> 20:18.073
and not others.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.693
For some it's rock-and-roll,

20:23.170 --> 20:25.943
for others it's Beethoven and Brahms.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.953
For one person, it's a Magritte painting,

20:36.650 --> 20:40.180
and for another, it's a guy on ice

20:40.180 --> 20:41.650
hurling himself into the air,

20:41.650 --> 20:45.823
spinning three times, and
landing on one tiny blade.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.320
Somehow, it just makes you
feel a little less lonely

20:49.320 --> 20:50.193
in the world.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.210
And who knows why.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.010
Claire, welcome.

21:11.010 --> 21:13.870
I'm Nadege St. Pierre,
this is my husband Bernard.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.530
He is pleased to meet you.

21:15.530 --> 21:19.940
These are our children,
Elodie and Angelique;

21:19.940 --> 21:22.930
this is my mother, Katia;
and our gouvernante,

21:22.930 --> 21:24.670
how do you say that in English?

21:24.670 --> 21:25.763
Housekeeper.

21:27.050 --> 21:27.883
Bonjour.

21:27.883 --> 21:29.760
Oh, no need, she does not speak French.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.150
She's from Tasmania.

21:31.150 --> 21:32.180
Tanzania.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.036
Yes, that.

21:34.036 --> 21:36.246
Nice to meet you all.

21:36.246 --> 21:39.558
My goodness, you speak such lovely French!

21:39.558 --> 21:41.941
Bernard, she speaks such lovely French!

21:43.020 --> 21:45.345
Mother, she speaks such lovely French!

21:47.656 --> 21:50.222
Such refinement, such education!

21:50.222 --> 21:51.213
So wonderful!

21:55.750 --> 21:58.610
Well, um, this is the key of your room.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.078
Come with me, I'll show you.

22:00.078 --> 22:01.682
Thank you.

22:01.682 --> 22:04.313
You speak so well French.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.260
Oh my God, Claire.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.350
I'm like really depressed
for you, except not really

22:16.350 --> 22:18.350
because I have a really
nice apartment to myself,

22:18.350 --> 22:19.820
but still.

22:19.820 --> 22:20.743
Thanks.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.190
You're welcome, Claire.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.870
So why do they call it a
chambre de bonne anyway,

22:27.870 --> 22:29.700
is it because everybody
that ever lived here

22:29.700 --> 22:32.290
died of depression and all
that was left was their bones?

22:32.290 --> 22:34.613
No, chambre de bonne means maid's room.

22:36.732 --> 22:37.565
Ew.

22:39.844 --> 22:40.677
Gross.

22:50.310 --> 22:51.461
Hello.

22:51.461 --> 22:54.203
Hi, my name is Claire Burkhardt.

22:54.203 --> 22:57.192
I'm here to do a documentary project.

22:57.192 --> 22:58.025
Why?

23:02.133 --> 23:04.158
Uh... it was all arranged before I left,

23:04.158 --> 23:05.316
with Mr. Le Drouin.

23:06.762 --> 23:08.303
With whom?

23:08.303 --> 23:09.138
With Mr. ...

23:09.138 --> 23:09.983
Who??

23:09.983 --> 23:10.816
Mr. Le Drouin.

23:12.082 --> 23:14.202
Ah, Mr. Le Drouin!

23:14.202 --> 23:15.694
Of course.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.235
Because I'll be honest with you,

23:17.235 --> 23:19.176
I can't understand you with your accent.

23:20.317 --> 23:21.908
At any rate, I can't help you.

23:23.477 --> 23:26.458
You better try the
Registrar's office instead.

23:26.458 --> 23:27.316
But... why...

23:27.316 --> 23:28.466
Have a nice day.

23:38.758 --> 23:39.591
Mr. Le Drouin.

23:45.161 --> 23:46.807
Who?

23:46.807 --> 23:48.057
Mister... Le... Drouin.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.996
Ah, Mr. Le Drouin!

23:53.946 --> 23:56.821
Frankly, I can hardly
understand that accent of yours.

23:59.239 --> 24:02.042
Go to the admissions office instead.

24:02.042 --> 24:03.208
It's over there.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.032
Ah, you're here to see Mr. Le Drouin!

24:22.032 --> 24:24.437
Why didn't you say so before?

24:24.437 --> 24:25.581
Though I must say,

24:25.581 --> 24:28.692
It's not easy to understand
you, with your...

24:28.692 --> 24:31.122
Yes, I know. My big fat accent.

24:31.122 --> 24:32.238
Yes, exactly.

24:35.156 --> 24:36.639
Go try the front desk.

24:41.572 --> 24:43.117
What did I just tell you?

24:43.117 --> 24:45.057
I know, Madame, but they told me...

24:45.057 --> 24:46.499
What you're doing is very rude.

24:46.499 --> 24:48.939
In France, we do not interrupt.

24:48.939 --> 24:51.272
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

24:52.822 --> 24:54.205
I'll take it from here.

24:55.110 --> 25:00.040
Hi, I'm, uh, I'm Rafal
Dabrowski, I, I'm a student here.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.053
Uh, they sent me to get you.

25:03.310 --> 25:04.143
Bonjour.

25:04.143 --> 25:06.010
Wow.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.380
Your French is so beautiful.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.250
So I heard you're gonna be filming us?

25:10.250 --> 25:12.053
Uh, yeah.

25:12.890 --> 25:16.673
And you'll be here all semester, I hope?

25:17.740 --> 25:18.573
Um,

25:19.407 --> 25:20.240
mm, mm-hmm.

25:21.690 --> 25:22.953
So, um,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.324
another question, um,

25:27.324 --> 25:29.574
do you have, um, boyfriend?

25:53.730 --> 25:54.563
Hi, um...

25:56.298 --> 25:58.006
...don't we... know each other?

25:59.199 --> 26:00.032
No, madame.

26:01.610 --> 26:02.443
Um, do you know

26:02.443 --> 26:04.659
why Thibaut Baudet isn't on the program?

26:05.784 --> 26:07.386
Yes, madame.

26:07.386 --> 26:09.894
It's because he retired at
the start of the season.

26:11.634 --> 26:13.100
So... he's not skating?

26:14.100 --> 26:15.499
Yes, exactly.

26:15.499 --> 26:16.682
He's not skating.

26:19.176 --> 26:20.022
However...

26:20.022 --> 26:22.180
...he's here to watch the competition.

26:41.059 --> 26:44.188
Well, thanks so much for
coming. It was great to see you.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.996
I hope you guys liked the performance.

26:45.996 --> 26:47.816
He skated really well today.

26:47.816 --> 26:48.916
Especially today.

26:51.196 --> 26:52.029
Hello...

26:53.062 --> 26:54.170
Can I help you?

26:55.761 --> 26:57.473
Yes. Uh... Sorry, uh...

26:57.473 --> 26:58.414
Excuse me.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.709
I tanted to well you...

27:03.260 --> 27:04.936
...I mean, you tell...

27:04.936 --> 27:07.119
...that you're my skavorite fater

27:10.764 --> 27:12.888
...I mean, fakorite skaver

27:15.540 --> 27:17.040
fuh... ska... fa...

27:17.959 --> 27:19.333
I need to go to the bathroom.

27:25.330 --> 27:26.363
Oh my God.

27:30.477 --> 27:32.338
...favorite skater!

27:32.338 --> 27:34.229
My favorite skater. Is you.

27:35.247 --> 27:36.080
That's all.

27:37.815 --> 27:38.668
...Me?!

27:38.668 --> 27:39.501
Yes!

27:40.450 --> 27:42.641
Well... thanks! That's nice of you.

27:42.641 --> 27:44.433
Wait... we know each other!

27:44.433 --> 27:46.576
We met in New York,

27:46.576 --> 27:48.559
that time I was waiting for a cab.

27:48.559 --> 27:51.000
We talked about puppets, and Guignol.

27:53.119 --> 27:54.556
It's funny, you know...

27:54.556 --> 27:56.569
I've always wanted to do some kind of show

27:56.569 --> 27:58.251
with both skating and puppetry.

27:58.251 --> 27:59.418
Oh? Uh, me too!

28:00.434 --> 28:01.267
No kidding.

28:02.350 --> 28:04.719
Wait, so you live in Paris now?

28:04.719 --> 28:06.852
I could give you my
contact info, if you want.

28:06.852 --> 28:07.685
YES!

29:42.838 --> 29:44.005
Was it good?

29:45.387 --> 29:46.470
Oh. Uh-huh.

30:04.540 --> 30:05.540
It was fine.

30:43.395 --> 30:46.012
So, you work near here, right?

30:46.012 --> 30:48.720
Yup, just around the corner,
for the Banc Francilienne

30:48.720 --> 30:50.303
You work at a bank?

30:52.612 --> 30:53.770
Isn't that boring?

30:56.237 --> 30:57.820
Yes. Life-threateningly.

30:59.009 --> 31:01.875
But I mean... you can't skate
your whole life, you know?

31:03.478 --> 31:04.944
And besides...

31:04.944 --> 31:07.219
...it was a sensible time for me to quit.

31:09.649 --> 31:11.824
I'm not getting any younger, after all.

31:15.377 --> 31:16.310
Well, so, uh...

31:17.399 --> 31:20.382
What should we do, for a
skating show with puppets?

31:21.329 --> 31:22.745
Honestly, I don't know.

31:22.745 --> 31:24.390
I really like the concept,

31:24.390 --> 31:27.529
but I'm not really sure
what it would look like.

31:27.529 --> 31:28.820
Maybe like a ballet.

31:30.494 --> 31:31.327
A ballet?

31:32.384 --> 31:33.650
You know what, in that case,

31:33.650 --> 31:35.340
we should work with my girlfriend, Trina.

31:35.340 --> 31:37.089
She's an incredible ballet dancer.

31:41.289 --> 31:42.314
Sorry... who?

31:44.169 --> 31:46.308
My girlfriend. Trina. A dancer.

31:46.308 --> 31:48.774
She's American, too. You guys should meet!

31:52.934 --> 31:53.767
You okay?

31:57.708 --> 31:58.541
Yes.

31:59.959 --> 32:00.950
Excuse me.

32:49.139 --> 32:51.330
- Attack! - Killed you! - Got you!

33:10.324 --> 33:11.557
Girls - stop it!

33:11.557 --> 33:12.390
Stop it.

33:13.719 --> 33:15.651
What happened!?

33:15.651 --> 33:18.001
Is it your lip? What happened? Show me...

33:18.001 --> 33:19.844
It wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!

33:19.844 --> 33:21.219
Show me, is it your lip?

33:21.219 --> 33:23.344
I didn't do anything, it
wasn't my fault! It wasn't me!

33:23.344 --> 33:25.243
Show me, show me...

33:25.243 --> 33:27.076
It wasn't my fault...

33:27.076 --> 33:29.581
What's going on? Angie?
What happened to her?

33:29.581 --> 33:32.685
- It wasn't me, I didn't do anything!
- What's wrong, Angelique? Show me.

33:32.685 --> 33:34.527
- It wasn't my fault!
- Show me, show me your lip.

33:34.527 --> 33:35.360
It's okay...

33:36.988 --> 33:38.529
It wasn't me, it wasn't my fault...

33:41.900 --> 33:45.720
Claire, don't stress, this
is not your fault, okay?

33:45.720 --> 33:46.833
These things happen.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.900
Can I do anything?

33:49.900 --> 33:51.540
No, really, don't worry yourself.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.923
Just go home and get some rest, okay?

33:55.940 --> 33:57.340
Go on. Have a good night.

34:13.763 --> 34:16.089
It wasn't my fault, wasn't me.

34:16.089 --> 34:17.572
Claire's the one who did it.

34:19.575 --> 34:21.241
Is that true, my little Angie?

34:23.105 --> 34:25.288
What did that mean old Claire do to you?

34:26.534 --> 34:27.734
Did Claire do this?

34:34.421 --> 34:36.029
I have a candy for you!

34:36.998 --> 34:37.935
But! --

34:37.935 --> 34:39.335
...did Claire hit you?

34:41.466 --> 34:42.299
Yeeeees!

34:44.540 --> 34:45.373
Yes!

34:48.165 --> 34:49.165
Dirty Bitch.

34:52.176 --> 34:54.368
Dirty bitch, dirty bitch, dirty bitch!

34:54.368 --> 34:56.584
Dirty bitch, dirty bitch, dirty bitch!

34:57.845 --> 34:58.678
Girls!

35:00.946 --> 35:02.712
Girls, watch your language!

35:05.125 --> 35:05.958
Girls...

35:47.349 --> 35:50.373
Are you feeling all right, Claire?

35:54.200 --> 35:55.550
Uh,

35:55.550 --> 35:56.723
yes.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.853
Are you happy here with us?

36:05.421 --> 36:06.254
Sure.

36:28.933 --> 36:30.739
She's not happy here.

36:30.739 --> 36:33.139
Yes, but that's not enough.
We'll need something more.

36:33.139 --> 36:34.530
Bernard, call Khadija.

36:34.530 --> 36:35.363
Khadija!

36:37.255 --> 36:39.221
Maybe she'll give us
something interesting.

36:42.624 --> 36:47.080
Khadija, we want to speak
to you about Claire,

36:47.080 --> 36:48.410
about Claire.

36:48.410 --> 36:49.603
Do you understand?

36:51.780 --> 36:55.230
Often you see Claire
with the children, right?

36:55.230 --> 36:59.883
Is she good with them,
or is she bad with them?

37:00.960 --> 37:04.090
Good, she is good.

37:04.090 --> 37:07.560
Bad. You mean bad, right?

37:07.560 --> 37:09.820
No, she is good.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.530
She's good always, Madam.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.393
She is, uh,

37:15.740 --> 37:17.823
beautiful with them.

37:18.740 --> 37:20.440
Maybe she does not understand.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.550
Bernard, you explain to her.

37:21.550 --> 37:24.660
Nevermind, I'll do it.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.310
Is she ever, mm, lazy?

37:27.310 --> 37:31.340
Like maybe she ignore
the children sometimes?

37:31.340 --> 37:32.660
No.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.020
No, Madam,

37:34.020 --> 37:38.270
she do, uh, the games with the children.

37:38.270 --> 37:41.800
She is much nice.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.903
She, uh, much im,

37:45.019 --> 37:46.613
uh, imagination.

37:46.613 --> 37:49.044
Imagination... Too much
imagination, maybe?

37:49.044 --> 37:50.625
She imagines too much?

37:50.625 --> 37:52.446
She imagines too much.

37:52.446 --> 37:54.146
Works for me.

37:54.146 --> 37:58.400
Uh, so you say that she's
maybe a little stupid,

37:58.400 --> 38:02.453
like a, a little slow,
head always in the clouds.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.393
Yes?

38:06.942 --> 38:08.410
Yes?

38:08.410 --> 38:09.533
Yes?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.610
Yes?

38:12.610 --> 38:14.403
- Yes?
- Yes?

38:14.403 --> 38:16.360
- Yes?
- Yes?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.600
Uh,

38:17.600 --> 38:18.433
yes.

38:20.133 --> 38:23.541
Excellent, thank you Khadija.

38:29.942 --> 38:32.043
You know, Mom, she's a nice girl,

38:32.043 --> 38:34.319
but a little too stupid to handle things.

38:34.319 --> 38:36.149
It's a shame!

38:36.149 --> 38:37.104
Yes, yes.

38:37.104 --> 38:37.937
A shame.

38:39.138 --> 38:40.288
She'll have to go.

38:41.390 --> 38:43.681
Yes, we'll have to find a way to get rid--

38:45.070 --> 38:48.490
Claire. Good evening.

38:48.490 --> 38:52.120
Oh, we have decided my
mother will supervise you now

38:52.120 --> 38:53.860
while you do the babysitting.

38:53.860 --> 38:57.140
So it's not too hard for you.

38:57.140 --> 38:58.673
Well, have a good night!

39:08.970 --> 39:11.963
Are you depressed, Claire?

39:14.761 --> 39:18.020
Angelique.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.364
My love.

39:19.364 --> 39:20.197
My baby!

39:22.184 --> 39:23.359
You are my star!

39:24.664 --> 39:25.890
You too!

39:25.890 --> 39:29.633
Come give Claire a great big kiss.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.831
Hmm.

39:32.831 --> 39:33.664
Hm.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.133
Oh my.

39:38.771 --> 39:43.213
Angelique, this is not very polite.

39:44.509 --> 39:46.900
You see, she's just a little baby,

39:46.900 --> 39:48.941
she doesn't know what she does.

39:51.020 --> 39:54.597
You're Grandmaman's little...

39:58.591 --> 40:00.827
Do you want some tea, Grandmaman?

40:00.827 --> 40:02.427
Yes, thank you so much!

40:03.510 --> 40:05.263
A sip for?

40:05.263 --> 40:06.490
Maman.

40:06.490 --> 40:07.489
Very good!

40:07.489 --> 40:11.218
And a sip for?

40:11.218 --> 40:12.850
Papa.
Yes,

40:12.850 --> 40:14.010
a sip for Papa.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.040
How about a sip for

40:18.940 --> 40:20.421
Claire?

40:20.421 --> 40:21.921
No, she's a dirty bitch!

40:23.271 --> 40:25.320
Oh my,

40:25.320 --> 40:26.723
you don't like Claire?

40:27.770 --> 40:29.310
No?

40:29.310 --> 40:30.627
Well,

40:30.627 --> 40:35.230
all right then, we
won't do sip for Claire.

40:35.230 --> 40:38.790
No tea for that nasty Claire.

40:38.790 --> 40:42.349
Nasty Claire.

40:42.349 --> 40:43.650
And, uh, how about

40:44.810 --> 40:47.749
a sip of tea for?
- Grandmaman.

41:23.457 --> 41:26.250
Okay, let's go over the house rules.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.410
As you know, I'm a huge germophobe,

41:28.410 --> 41:31.420
and you've been sleeping
in a chambre de bonne,

41:31.420 --> 41:33.870
and chambres de bonne probably have nits.

41:33.870 --> 41:37.290
So I do ask that you stay a
minimum of 10 feet away from me,

41:37.290 --> 41:40.160
or 3.05 meters in local measurements.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.540
Wait, so nits can't
travel more than 10 feet?

41:42.540 --> 41:45.180
Claire, do not put the
fear of God into me.

41:45.180 --> 41:47.763
Well, can I get a pillow at least?

41:49.551 --> 41:52.533
Okay.

41:54.539 --> 41:57.389
But I will be asking you to
sleep in protective headgear.

41:59.340 --> 42:00.470
Night, Claire.

42:08.205 --> 42:09.205
Goodnight.

43:45.919 --> 43:49.600
PETRUSHKA - Adaptation
for Skater and Puppeteer.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.200
St. Petersburg, Russia. The 1830s.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.033
A carnival.

43:55.270 --> 44:00.270
Three puppets: a ballerina, a
Moor, and Petrushka, a clown.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.087
A magician called the Charlatan

44:05.087 --> 44:07.370
brings them to life.

44:07.370 --> 44:09.270
Petrushka falls in love
with the ballerina,

44:09.270 --> 44:11.013
but she loves the Moor.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.310
Petrushka is angry and hurt,

44:15.310 --> 44:17.993
and he challenges the Moor to a duel.

44:21.321 --> 44:24.840
But the Moor kills him.

44:24.840 --> 44:28.510
So Petrushka's ghost floats
up and he curses the Charlatan

44:28.510 --> 44:31.590
for bringing him to life,

44:31.590 --> 44:33.280
before he dies,

44:33.280 --> 44:34.870
again.

44:34.870 --> 44:36.630
So you'll perform it with me?

44:36.630 --> 44:37.720
You'll be Petrushka on skates.

44:37.720 --> 44:40.430
I'll be all the other
characters as puppets.

44:40.430 --> 44:42.030
It'll be perfect.

44:42.030 --> 44:44.030
So you're in?

44:44.030 --> 44:45.215
Um.

44:45.215 --> 44:46.858
Well, Claire, uh...

44:46.858 --> 44:48.223
It's a great story

44:48.223 --> 44:51.039
and I'm sure you'll find
a skater for your project.

44:51.039 --> 44:53.719
But I don't see why it needs to be me.

44:53.719 --> 44:54.951
What!?

44:54.951 --> 44:57.566
There are so many other skaters in Paris.

44:57.566 --> 44:59.694
More talented ones, for that matter.

44:59.694 --> 45:01.600
- Y-you don't get it.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.110
- No, no, no, Claire, you don't get it,

45:05.110 --> 45:07.070
but that's only because you don't know

45:07.070 --> 45:09.210
anything about skating.

45:09.210 --> 45:11.840
Just take my word for it, okay?

45:11.840 --> 45:15.300
I'm, I'm past my prime.

45:15.300 --> 45:18.060
I had my 15 minutes and now no one wants

45:18.060 --> 45:19.700
or needs to see me on the ice anymore.

45:19.700 --> 45:22.430
I, I'm old news.

45:22.430 --> 45:24.060
Okay, but you wouldn't understand-

45:24.060 --> 45:25.373
Will you shut up!

45:31.460 --> 45:32.293
Enjoy.

45:35.652 --> 45:37.150
Thank you.

45:37.150 --> 45:39.330
- Claire, what I'm trying-
- Nah-uh-uh.

45:39.330 --> 45:42.643
Say one more word and I will
throw this scone in your face.

45:52.120 --> 45:52.953
Look.

45:54.350 --> 45:58.173
You can't see yourself,

45:59.990 --> 46:01.203
but I can.

46:03.128 --> 46:06.923
And I can see there is no
one else out there like you.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.650
Maybe you don't know how
much talent you have,

46:11.650 --> 46:12.900
but I think that you do

46:13.880 --> 46:16.823
and you try to deny it.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.700
You try to forget what it
was like to be on the ice

46:20.700 --> 46:23.300
because it's too painful to remember.

46:23.300 --> 46:26.120
Instead, you've chosen a
more manageable kind of pain,

46:26.120 --> 46:27.800
the kind of pain you feel every day

46:27.800 --> 46:29.360
at la Banque Francilienne.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.513
That kind of pain you can handle.

46:34.580 --> 46:37.560
It's the white noise in
between the coffee machine

46:37.560 --> 46:39.830
and the snack machine and the restroom-

46:39.830 --> 46:41.593
- But-
- Ah, I am speaking.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.010
It's hard to explain, but

46:49.010 --> 46:51.670
when you were on the ice,

46:51.670 --> 46:56.133
you were like this human sunbeam,

46:57.380 --> 47:01.563
or like a big beating heart on skates.

47:02.430 --> 47:05.403
And now you're trying to
erase it because you're hurt.

47:08.337 --> 47:11.160
Really, who can blame you?

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
Well, you.

47:14.475 --> 47:15.308
Yes,

47:16.838 --> 47:17.671
me.

47:20.665 --> 47:21.665
I blame you.

47:24.187 --> 47:26.860
Because some of us need to see a sunbeam

47:26.860 --> 47:28.143
every once in a while.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.373
Some of us need to feel a beating heart.

47:38.490 --> 47:39.633
Some of us need you.

47:42.753 --> 47:47.086
Uh, can I talk?

47:51.202 --> 47:54.035
You know, I'm lucky to have a job.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.190
I mean, in this economy,
it's a privilege to be...

48:06.762 --> 48:08.679
You know, you're right.

48:09.560 --> 48:12.553
All I do at work is go to the restroom.

48:13.990 --> 48:16.053
I pee like 20 times a day.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.441
I pee all day long.

48:21.630 --> 48:24.496
I think it's just to give
me an activity to do.

48:27.430 --> 48:29.435
I don't have anything anymore.

48:33.719 --> 48:36.386
So you'll be Petrushka for me?

49:05.930 --> 49:07.480
Okay, let's take
- Okay.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.251
- a look at the next scene.

49:09.251 --> 49:13.380
So Petrushka tries to win
the heart of the ballerina,

49:13.380 --> 49:17.003
but she isn't interested in him.

49:17.877 --> 49:19.154
What?!

49:19.154 --> 49:20.895
She's not interested in me?!

49:21.867 --> 49:24.076
Well, we'll just see about that.

49:24.076 --> 49:25.092
Give me that.

49:27.720 --> 49:28.553
Look

49:29.815 --> 49:31.930
deep into my Russian eyes.

49:31.930 --> 49:33.210
Oh my God.

49:33.210 --> 49:35.068
You will love me.

49:35.068 --> 49:37.710
Say that you vant me.

49:37.710 --> 49:39.665
I love you. Kiss me, you fool.

49:44.091 --> 49:46.369
You see? Child's play.

49:46.369 --> 49:47.694
Bravo. Give me that.

49:47.694 --> 49:50.723
- Okay, okay.
- Let's take it from the top.

49:51.670 --> 49:55.440
You are trying to impress her,
but she runs away from you.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.960
And then you curse the
portrait of the Charlatan

49:56.960 --> 49:58.722
who brought you to life.

49:58.722 --> 49:59.654
Okay, okay.

49:59.654 --> 50:01.324
I'm going to improvise a bit.

50:01.324 --> 50:03.056
Can you put on the music?

50:59.930 --> 51:01.930
You had your 15 minutes,

51:01.930 --> 51:06.440
and now no one needs or
wants to see you on that ice.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.867
You are old news.

51:32.791 --> 51:34.982
What are you doing!?

51:34.982 --> 51:36.298
I don't know, Claire...

51:37.737 --> 51:39.770
I... thought I was done with all this.

51:41.001 --> 51:42.642
I mean, I have a life, a job...

51:43.762 --> 51:46.419
I don't want to do stuff like this.

51:46.419 --> 51:47.435
What is this?

51:49.330 --> 51:50.540
It's my sock.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.090
It is more than that.

51:52.090 --> 51:53.150
It is a hostage.

51:53.150 --> 51:54.610
I'm taking your pretty little sock home,

51:54.610 --> 51:57.130
and I'm going to keep it until
you get back out on the ice

51:57.130 --> 51:58.543
and start performing again.

52:01.012 --> 52:03.549
You know, I don't give a
shit about an old sock.

52:03.549 --> 52:05.020
And about performing?

52:05.020 --> 52:07.803
I suppose you don't give
a shit about that either?

52:09.768 --> 52:12.559
You know, you're going to
have that sock forever.

52:13.890 --> 52:15.143
You promised me,

52:16.480 --> 52:19.163
I trusted you, don't let me down.

52:21.727 --> 52:25.695
Prove yourself worthy of your sock,

52:25.695 --> 52:26.528
Thibaut.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.010
You look happy.

55:06.533 --> 55:11.113
So you're, uh, interested in the festival?

55:12.260 --> 55:13.713
Uh, yeah.

55:14.663 --> 55:16.357
Um, maybe, um.

55:17.710 --> 55:19.203
You, too?

55:19.203 --> 55:21.070
No,

55:21.070 --> 55:24.897
not at all.

55:26.461 --> 55:29.230
You're really charming, you know?

55:29.230 --> 55:32.480
Charming, and a little shy.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.430
Shy?

55:33.430 --> 55:35.310
Yes, there's something about you,

55:35.310 --> 55:37.863
like you're not very self-assured.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.663
It's really lovely, uh, poetic even.

55:43.300 --> 55:46.177
Do you, uh, know the
French word, mm, farouche?

55:47.314 --> 55:48.903
Uh, no.

55:49.860 --> 55:54.423
It means shy, but it also means wild.

55:55.970 --> 55:59.660
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're a little bit of both.

56:02.860 --> 56:04.420
I don't know.

56:04.420 --> 56:05.717
Oh, sure you do.

56:08.820 --> 56:11.000
Deep down you're a tigress.

56:13.089 --> 56:14.422
We both know it.

56:15.943 --> 56:18.723
Does it bother you that
I can read your mind?

56:21.572 --> 56:24.583
Um.

56:24.583 --> 56:25.491
Hey, Rafal!

56:25.491 --> 56:27.706
You gonna come rehearse with us or not?!

56:27.706 --> 56:29.339
Uh, hang on, be right there!

56:33.840 --> 56:34.673
See you,

56:35.547 --> 56:36.380
Tigress.

56:44.060 --> 56:47.070
You know what your fatal
flaw is, don't you?

56:47.070 --> 56:49.060
No, please, tell me.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.570
I'm getting to that, Claire.

56:50.570 --> 56:52.300
Please be patient.

56:52.300 --> 56:55.780
Your problem is, you're not sexual enough.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.500
A guy just called me a tigress,

56:57.500 --> 56:59.620
and now you're telling me
it's because I'm not sexual?

56:59.620 --> 57:01.220
Exactly, Claire.

57:01.220 --> 57:04.300
He was using reverse psychology on you

57:04.300 --> 57:06.500
to turn you into a sexual being.

57:06.500 --> 57:07.520
Only it didn't work.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.170
However, my PowerPoint on the
subject should do the trick.

57:10.170 --> 57:11.370
You prepared a PowerPoint?

57:11.370 --> 57:12.843
Shh it's loading.

57:16.860 --> 57:20.470
Now, there are two types
of people in this world,

57:20.470 --> 57:21.663
the non-sexual,

57:22.700 --> 57:23.740
that's you,

57:23.740 --> 57:24.773
and the sexual,

57:25.916 --> 57:28.540
ta-da.

57:28.540 --> 57:33.240
So now we ask, how do
we turn this into this?

57:33.240 --> 57:35.410
It's simple, you wanna be a tigress?

57:35.410 --> 57:38.250
You have to think like a tigress.

57:38.250 --> 57:41.740
The first step is to develop a
nice sexually arousing growl.

57:41.740 --> 57:43.148
Now growl for me.

57:43.148 --> 57:44.108
No.

57:44.108 --> 57:45.434
Do it or I'll scream.

57:46.855 --> 57:48.501
More oomph!

57:50.507 --> 57:52.357
I need more, Claire.

57:53.475 --> 57:54.715
More!

57:56.192 --> 57:58.893
I'm not sexually excited,
guess I'll read a magazine.

58:01.570 --> 58:03.358
Hey, this is in French.

58:05.590 --> 58:07.512
Nope, frigid!

58:11.100 --> 58:12.464
Dry as the Sahara.

58:16.072 --> 58:17.513
Ooh.

58:21.720 --> 58:23.433
Oop, nope, I was ovulating.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.957
Hey, that one was good!

58:35.857 --> 58:37.539
Our rehearsals are so nice.

58:37.539 --> 58:39.438
Yeah. A little too nice, maybe.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.517
What do you mean?!

58:44.873 --> 58:46.263
Oh, um, just that, uh...

58:46.263 --> 58:49.028
It's cool just having
something nice to do.

58:49.028 --> 58:50.394
I could get used to it.

58:52.721 --> 58:53.996
Oh, check this out...

58:56.043 --> 58:58.259
I'm going to submit us for the festival.

59:00.282 --> 59:01.115
You and me.

59:04.322 --> 59:05.155
You and me...

59:09.800 --> 59:13.090
And do not forget, you
have to do this with me

59:13.090 --> 59:17.200
because I still have your sock.

59:17.200 --> 59:20.443
Yes, I know, I know.

59:23.860 --> 59:24.693
See ya.

59:36.136 --> 59:37.207
Hey dude,

59:37.207 --> 59:38.878
that wasn't your Asian chick.

59:38.878 --> 59:40.432
No, no... that was a colleague.

59:40.432 --> 59:41.565
We were rehearsing.

59:41.565 --> 59:43.536
Ah, yes, "rehearsing."

59:43.536 --> 59:46.194
So, how many times have you
banged your "colleague"?

59:47.180 --> 59:48.046
Shut up, Maxime.

59:48.046 --> 59:48.945
What, you don't want to?

59:48.945 --> 59:50.544
No, of course I don't want
to! Why would I want to?

59:50.544 --> 59:51.610
See, you do want to!

59:52.925 --> 59:53.758
Want to what?

59:54.744 --> 59:58.161
To bang his other girlfriend, of course.

59:59.141 --> 1:00:00.436
All right. Gotta go.

1:00:00.436 --> 1:00:01.269
So long!

1:00:03.470 --> 1:00:05.204
What's Maxime talking about?

1:00:05.204 --> 1:00:06.454
God knows.

1:00:07.380 --> 1:00:08.267
He's insane.

1:00:26.076 --> 1:00:29.023
Hello, my name is Claire Burkhardt,

1:00:29.023 --> 1:00:30.739
I'm American, I live in Paris,

1:00:32.599 --> 1:00:34.750
and I wanted to drop off these...

1:00:34.750 --> 1:00:36.283
No. Not possible.

1:00:37.417 --> 1:00:38.790
Can I at least tell you

1:00:38.790 --> 1:00:40.398
what my question is first?

1:00:42.932 --> 1:00:44.198
Fine, if you must.

1:00:45.035 --> 1:00:47.660
I wanted to leave these flyers.

1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:49.552
For my puppetry services.

1:00:51.498 --> 1:00:53.018
You want parents to hire you

1:00:53.018 --> 1:00:54.734
for birthday parties - is that right?

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:56.175
Yes, exactly.

1:00:56.175 --> 1:00:58.746
Well, I'm not going to tell you no.

1:00:58.746 --> 1:00:59.754
But, frankly,

1:01:00.665 --> 1:01:02.936
you'll have a hard time
getting hired in Paris,

1:01:02.936 --> 1:01:05.029
because the thing is, Parisian parents --

1:01:05.029 --> 1:01:07.804
- - they have standards, you see.

1:01:07.804 --> 1:01:09.612
But I'm not going to tell you no.

1:01:11.055 --> 1:01:11.930
That said --

1:01:11.930 --> 1:01:14.390
I'm going to put your flyers
at the very back of the store,

1:01:14.390 --> 1:01:17.190
behind everything, where
no one will see them.

1:01:17.190 --> 1:01:18.023
Okay?

1:01:20.059 --> 1:01:20.939
Thanks.

1:01:20.939 --> 1:01:22.755
Anytime, my dear.

1:01:22.755 --> 1:01:24.538
And good luck, eh?

1:01:24.538 --> 1:01:25.414
Because --

1:01:25.414 --> 1:01:27.405
It's not easy to get hired in Paris.

1:01:33.365 --> 1:01:35.770
Did you always wanna be a puppeteer?

1:01:35.770 --> 1:01:36.963
No, not necessarily.

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:41.490
Sometimes I wanted to be a
writer, sometimes a musician.

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:45.120
I just wanted to create my
own universe however I could.

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.200
The universe of Rafal

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:52.200
or the Raphaelite universe.

1:01:55.470 --> 1:01:57.040
Get it?

1:01:57.040 --> 1:01:58.850
Raphaelite has a double meaning there,

1:01:58.850 --> 1:02:01.613
because Raphael, or Rafal...

1:02:04.290 --> 1:02:05.790
You see, there was once a great painter

1:02:05.790 --> 1:02:07.670
by the name of Raphael.

1:02:07.670 --> 1:02:09.230
It was different for me,

1:02:09.230 --> 1:02:13.124
I always wanted to-
The Raphaelite universe.

1:02:15.950 --> 1:02:18.460
I just always wanted to tell
stories however I could,

1:02:18.460 --> 1:02:20.093
one way or another.

1:02:21.626 --> 1:02:22.840
Do you like stories?

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:24.610
Oh, yeah.

1:02:24.610 --> 1:02:27.880
Um, I have a friend
who is a figure skater,

1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:31.210
and he can tell the most
beautiful stories on ice

1:02:31.210 --> 1:02:33.680
without saying a single-

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:35.437
You know who's beautiful?

1:02:36.910 --> 1:02:40.943
In fact, his name is Thibaut
Baudet, the figure skater.

1:02:42.410 --> 1:02:43.570
Maybe you've heard of him?

1:02:43.570 --> 1:02:45.923
Mm, don't think so.

1:02:47.410 --> 1:02:49.143
He's amazing.

1:02:49.990 --> 1:02:51.290
You know who's amazing?

1:02:56.952 --> 1:02:57.943
Wait, why?

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:00.875
You're beautiful.

1:03:00.875 --> 1:03:01.780
You're just so beautiful,

1:03:01.780 --> 1:03:04.246
I, I can't stop thinking about you.

1:03:04.246 --> 1:03:05.079
Really?

1:03:05.079 --> 1:03:06.379
Since the day I met you.

1:03:12.302 --> 1:03:15.635
Y-you're allowed to kiss back, you know?

1:03:25.363 --> 1:03:27.102
You're even allowed to open your mouth.

1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.820
You learn fast, little tigress.

1:04:21.130 --> 1:04:21.963
What?

1:04:24.374 --> 1:04:25.740
It,

1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:28.033
it's a little complicated.

1:04:30.060 --> 1:04:30.893
Complicated,

1:04:32.005 --> 1:04:35.803
what do you mean, uh, complicated?

1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:44.933
You've never done it?

1:04:47.940 --> 1:04:48.773
Wow.

1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:51.113
Why?

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:55.210
Because no one wanted
to have sex with a girl

1:04:55.210 --> 1:04:58.113
who has 45 puppets on her bed.

1:05:02.084 --> 1:05:04.163
Well, um,

1:05:05.470 --> 1:05:08.793
personally, I'd call that a turn on.

1:05:19.983 --> 1:05:21.733
I knew I liked you.

1:05:30.961 --> 1:05:34.711
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh, that was amazing.

1:05:44.491 --> 1:05:45.741
There's more,

1:05:50.248 --> 1:05:51.081
right?

1:06:16.578 --> 1:06:18.997
What's wrong beautiful?

1:06:18.997 --> 1:06:21.497
Why are you looking like that?

1:06:22.688 --> 1:06:23.938
It's nothing.

1:06:27.605 --> 1:06:29.022
Nothing at all.

1:06:35.630 --> 1:06:37.410
Claire, question,

1:06:37.410 --> 1:06:40.310
if somebody serves you a
suggestively shaped croissant,

1:06:40.310 --> 1:06:41.630
do you have the right to sue?

1:06:41.630 --> 1:06:42.873
Because according to my attorney...

1:06:42.873 --> 1:06:45.060
Oh dear God.

1:06:45.060 --> 1:06:46.430
What happened to you?

1:06:46.430 --> 1:06:49.460
Some birthday kid's mom
put a clown wig on me.

1:06:49.460 --> 1:06:50.320
That's what.

1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:52.870
You know I have coulrophobia,
or a fear of clowns,

1:06:52.870 --> 1:06:54.610
due to the time a clown
bit me in the wild.

1:06:54.610 --> 1:06:55.443
Please remove it.

1:06:55.443 --> 1:06:56.910
Give me a sec, will you?

1:06:56.910 --> 1:06:59.130
An army of rabid moms
stuck this to my head

1:06:59.130 --> 1:07:02.290
with France's national
supply of bobby pins.

1:07:02.290 --> 1:07:05.713
Also, my day was fantastic,
thank you for asking.

1:07:07.150 --> 1:07:08.440
Mademoiselle?

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:09.475
Yes, you.

1:07:09.475 --> 1:07:12.713
Ze puppet person, come here at once!

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:15.230
Oui, madame?

1:07:15.230 --> 1:07:19.620
You will wear this clown wig
or else, s'il vous plait.

1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:21.660
I don't need it, I'm
here to do a puppet show.

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:25.790
Ah, but you do not understand,

1:07:25.790 --> 1:07:29.480
the birthday girl is my
tiny snot of a daughter

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:34.423
and she insists that you wear it.

1:07:35.437 --> 1:07:39.950
Wear it or die!

1:07:39.950 --> 1:07:41.609
Tres bien.

1:07:41.609 --> 1:07:42.942
Kids, come here!

1:07:43.793 --> 1:07:48.793
The clown lady is here
to do face painting!

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.830
What is that on my cheek?

1:07:53.830 --> 1:07:55.600
A corpse?

1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:57.693
No, it's a butterfly.

1:07:59.061 --> 1:07:59.894
No,

1:08:01.726 --> 1:08:03.345
I wanted

1:08:03.345 --> 1:08:08.345
a good butterfly!

1:08:09.750 --> 1:08:12.590
Oh, la la la la!

1:08:12.590 --> 1:08:14.763
We are very disapproving!

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:19.530
As punishment, we will let
our children run around

1:08:19.530 --> 1:08:21.913
and scream while you try to perform,

1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:26.010
and then we will criticize
your performance,

1:08:26.010 --> 1:08:29.873
which we did not watch!

1:08:32.039 --> 1:08:33.680
And

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:34.613
scene.

1:08:38.110 --> 1:08:38.943
Is there more?

1:09:10.530 --> 1:09:11.753
No, don't say that.

1:09:19.710 --> 1:09:20.910
Give me that.

1:09:24.811 --> 1:09:26.923
You know, it's funny,

1:09:26.923 --> 1:09:29.073
all my life I've only ever done one thing.

1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:33.973
Every single day, repeat
and repeat and repeat.

1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.150
And I was pretty damn good at that thing.

1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:42.523
And now it turns out I
can't do anything else.

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:47.250
It's like I was just dropped
in the middle of the ocean

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:48.505
without a lifeboat.

1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:55.043
And so when Claire
asked me to skate again,

1:09:57.390 --> 1:10:02.130
I felt like I could just swim
back, a million miles back

1:10:02.130 --> 1:10:06.680
just to, to skate and, and
feel like myself again.

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:08.170
You know what I mean?

1:10:08.170 --> 1:10:09.837
Yep. Mm-hmm.

1:10:11.860 --> 1:10:12.783
Did you hear me?

1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:17.930
Sure, skating, repetitive,
million miles away.

1:10:26.034 --> 1:10:27.034
Thank you.

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:35.641
Oh, right. The puppets.

1:11:37.882 --> 1:11:38.715
Excuse me.

1:11:58.373 --> 1:11:59.206
Here.

1:12:00.244 --> 1:12:02.177
And, um, sorry about everything.

1:12:04.238 --> 1:12:07.404
No need to be sorry, Monsieur Petrushka.

1:12:07.404 --> 1:12:09.870
I submitted us for the
puppetry festival --

1:12:11.210 --> 1:12:12.843
- - and they've selected us.

1:12:15.303 --> 1:12:16.136
Here.

1:12:27.866 --> 1:12:29.217
Unbelievable.

1:12:29.217 --> 1:12:31.129
Why are you forcing me to do this?

1:12:31.129 --> 1:12:32.920
Why can't you just let it go?

1:12:34.503 --> 1:12:35.686
Excuse me?

1:12:35.686 --> 1:12:39.190
I, I already told you, I'm
not interested anymore.

1:12:39.190 --> 1:12:40.840
But y-you were.

1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:43.470
Yes, I was, and now I'm not anymore.

1:12:43.470 --> 1:12:46.080
Is that, is that so hard to understand?

1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:47.250
I mean, w-why do this?

1:12:47.250 --> 1:12:48.634
Why, why, what's the point

1:12:48.634 --> 1:12:50.120
of forcing me?
- I'm not trying to force you.

1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:52.950
I'm trying to help you, that's
what you do for friends.

1:12:52.950 --> 1:12:54.475
But we're not friends!

1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:10.438
We-we're colleagues, we know each other.

1:13:12.378 --> 1:13:13.660
Claire, you...

1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:16.108
...you think we're close,
because you know my performances.

1:13:16.108 --> 1:13:17.792
But the "me"...

1:13:17.792 --> 1:13:20.258
The Thibaut on the ice and
the Thibaut in front of you

1:13:20.258 --> 1:13:21.653
aren't the same person.

1:13:21.653 --> 1:13:22.534
Okay?

1:13:22.534 --> 1:13:25.590
You know, I... I have my own private life.

1:13:25.590 --> 1:13:27.131
And you're not part of it.

1:13:29.074 --> 1:13:32.090
You don't need to take care of me, Claire.

1:13:32.090 --> 1:13:34.574
You'd do better to concentrate on you.

1:13:34.574 --> 1:13:36.307
Okay? I don't need your help.

1:13:38.228 --> 1:13:40.728
Go do something that has meaning for you.

1:13:42.704 --> 1:13:44.404
You mean like you with the bank?

1:13:50.430 --> 1:13:53.140
Claire, I, I, I don't mean to hurt you.

1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:54.340
You're not hurting me.

1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:02.903
If the ice you wasn't the real you,

1:14:05.083 --> 1:14:07.240
then you had me fooled.

1:14:13.941 --> 1:14:16.941
If you see him, tell him I miss him.

1:14:19.730 --> 1:14:21.683
Goodbye, Petrushka.

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:37.003
I don't get it, I thought
he and I were getting along.

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.490
You think maybe he's afraid?

1:14:40.490 --> 1:14:41.590
Afraid of what?

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:43.930
Who knows?

1:14:43.930 --> 1:14:46.880
Guys are just fearful creatures.

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:49.730
And then they try to cover it
up by acting like assholes.

1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:53.830
Could be.

1:14:53.830 --> 1:14:57.597
Anyway, lucky for you,
it's not your problem.

1:15:01.306 --> 1:15:02.557
I don't know.

1:15:02.557 --> 1:15:05.053
It's just so hard to let go.

1:15:07.190 --> 1:15:10.130
I got too invested

1:15:10.130 --> 1:15:10.963
in the show.

1:15:12.430 --> 1:15:17.113
Fortunately, you have
other things in your life.

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:21.233
Yeah.

1:15:25.166 --> 1:15:26.616
I guess

1:15:26.616 --> 1:15:28.153
he's just scared.

1:15:31.890 --> 1:15:34.660
You know, it's ironic, the name Thibaut,

1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:36.113
it means brave.

1:15:37.070 --> 1:15:38.690
Funny, huh?

1:15:38.690 --> 1:15:40.340
Yeah.

1:15:40.340 --> 1:15:41.173
Funny.

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.230
So did you like it?

1:15:53.230 --> 1:15:55.011
Yeah, it was great.

1:15:55.011 --> 1:15:56.340
Really?

1:15:56.340 --> 1:15:59.960
Yeah, the music, the acting,

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:01.063
it was perfect.

1:16:02.150 --> 1:16:04.000
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

1:16:05.170 --> 1:16:06.080
Why?

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.370
Why?

1:16:07.370 --> 1:16:10.150
Because it was mediocre,
and that's being generous.

1:16:10.150 --> 1:16:12.120
It was amateurish.

1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:16.463
The problems are obvious
to an educated person.

1:16:20.470 --> 1:16:22.113
Well, anyway, it was nice.

1:16:23.690 --> 1:16:28.200
Nice, interesting
concept you have of nice.

1:16:28.200 --> 1:16:31.680
Maybe one day you'll understand
why that wasn't good cinema.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:33.130
Okay.

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:35.053
What do you mean, okay?

1:16:36.490 --> 1:16:38.800
I mean, I don't care, Rafal.

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:41.750
We can agree to disagree, but
I don't wanna fight about it.

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.133
Are you sure about that?

1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:01.547
I don't get it, Rafal.

1:17:08.850 --> 1:17:11.310
You just want us to fight

1:17:12.968 --> 1:17:14.093
for nothing?

1:17:48.250 --> 1:17:51.150
I don't know how to tell him
it doesn't feel good anymore.

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:56.590
None of this makes sense.
All he wants to do is fight.

1:17:56.590 --> 1:17:58.640
And at first, I thought it
was because he was upset,

1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:01.680
and then I realized it's turning him on.

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:04.280
It's all just to have sex.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:06.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Claire.

1:18:06.550 --> 1:18:07.823
Back up, back up.

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:12.200
You had sex?

1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:13.903
- Yeah.
- Without consulting me?

1:18:15.119 --> 1:18:16.090
It just kinda happened.

1:18:16.090 --> 1:18:18.330
But I never got to give
you your sexual education.

1:18:18.330 --> 1:18:20.280
Nevermind, we'll start now.

1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:25.280
Okay, the first rule in
having sex is: don't have sex.

1:18:26.420 --> 1:18:27.860
Little late.

1:18:27.860 --> 1:18:29.870
Listen, Claire, you may not know it,

1:18:29.870 --> 1:18:33.129
but you are an innocent baby marshmallow.

1:18:33.129 --> 1:18:34.820
And I don't think you
understand the gravity here.

1:18:34.820 --> 1:18:36.140
Do you realize what happens when a man

1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:39.653
sticks his thing in you?

1:18:41.887 --> 1:18:43.880
The answer is germs, mega germs.

1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:46.880
Now, I'm about to tell
you something so gross,

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:50.560
so disgusting, you're going
to want to cover your ears.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:51.610
I'll cover mine, too.

1:18:58.031 --> 1:18:58.864
Okay.

1:19:00.430 --> 1:19:02.490
So you know condoms, right?

1:19:02.490 --> 1:19:04.071
Yes, Julia, I know condoms.

1:19:04.071 --> 1:19:05.050
Could we maybe-
- So the thing about condoms

1:19:05.050 --> 1:19:09.070
is when a guy puts one on, it
covers his one thing, right?

1:19:09.070 --> 1:19:13.490
But it doesn't cover his other two things.

1:19:13.490 --> 1:19:15.900
- Testicles.
- I'm sorry, Claire,

1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:17.470
I wasn't emotionally prepared for that,

1:19:17.470 --> 1:19:22.090
but, yes, it doesn't cover them.

1:19:22.090 --> 1:19:25.780
That would be impossible and painful.

1:19:25.780 --> 1:19:27.750
So? Men should learn to live with pain.

1:19:27.750 --> 1:19:29.400
It toughens the loins.

1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:30.930
Now, it's obviously too late for you,

1:19:30.930 --> 1:19:34.300
who have exposed yourself to
all manners of ball germs,

1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:37.890
or, in medical terms, testicooties.

1:19:37.890 --> 1:19:40.360
But, for those as yet un-besmirched,

1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:42.530
I've made a miracle product,

1:19:42.530 --> 1:19:46.203
the likes of which shall
revolutionize the sex industry.

1:19:48.350 --> 1:19:51.070
See, it covers the entire
leg so not one of those

1:19:51.070 --> 1:19:54.060
icky man-germs will
touch your precious skin.

1:19:54.060 --> 1:19:55.790
And for those who live on the wild side,

1:19:55.790 --> 1:19:57.400
not that I endorse that sort of thing,

1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:01.053
I've developed the lederhosen variety.

1:20:02.300 --> 1:20:03.133
Good God.

1:20:03.133 --> 1:20:03.966
Say what you will,

1:20:03.966 --> 1:20:06.460
but I plan to make a
killing at Oktoberfest.

1:20:06.460 --> 1:20:10.263
I don't know. I, I think
people want sex to be fun.

1:20:11.950 --> 1:20:13.900
Wait, sex is supposed to be fun?

1:20:31.870 --> 1:20:33.786
What's wrong?

1:20:33.786 --> 1:20:37.173
I don't know.

1:20:37.173 --> 1:20:39.910
I think I might be a bad person.

1:20:39.910 --> 1:20:41.518
What makes you say that?

1:20:42.550 --> 1:20:45.143
I think I made a really bad mistake today.

1:20:46.550 --> 1:20:48.980
Saying no to the puppet show, I mean.

1:20:48.980 --> 1:20:52.083
Oh, really? So you think
I gave you bad advice?

1:20:55.370 --> 1:20:56.203
I don't know.

1:20:56.203 --> 1:20:57.790
All I did was tell you the truth.

1:20:57.790 --> 1:20:59.220
Your skating days are behind you,

1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:01.040
you know that.
- Yes, I know that, yes.

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:04.310
Yes, but I don't know, I, I like,

1:21:04.310 --> 1:21:05.998
I liked working with Claire.

1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:10.007
It just gave me something
that was missing from my life,

1:21:10.007 --> 1:21:11.500
you know?

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:12.650
Wow.

1:21:12.650 --> 1:21:14.873
Well, sorry to hear that.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.703
Did you ever just sort of
not appreciate somebody,

1:21:26.210 --> 1:21:29.810
like not knowing how much
they cared about you,

1:21:29.810 --> 1:21:32.100
or how much you were hurting them,

1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:34.820
even though it was right
there in front of you?

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:37.470
Gosh, I don't know, Thibaut,

1:21:37.470 --> 1:21:41.080
what with spending my
days overworking my body,

1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.940
making myself crazy for a dance company

1:21:43.940 --> 1:21:47.130
that sees women as disposable.

1:21:47.130 --> 1:21:49.470
Then coming home to a boyfriend

1:21:49.470 --> 1:21:52.363
who stares through me
as if I'm a hologram.

1:21:54.150 --> 1:21:58.083
That definitely takes up all
my mental space these days.

1:21:59.310 --> 1:22:02.010
But now that I think about it,

1:22:02.010 --> 1:22:05.530
definitely go find your sweetie-pie Claire

1:22:05.530 --> 1:22:09.608
and let her know she has
been missing from your life.

1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:21.233
Did you want any soup?

1:22:32.533 --> 1:22:33.366
Fuck!

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:46.653
Claire,

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:50.023
Claire, wake up.

1:22:51.730 --> 1:22:52.780
What? Are you okay?

1:22:52.780 --> 1:22:53.613
I don't know, Claire.

1:22:53.613 --> 1:22:56.513
I'm just overwhelmed by this
feeling that you don't love me.

1:22:57.595 --> 1:22:59.560
Of course, I love you.

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.843
I don't think so. You don't seem sure.

1:23:03.150 --> 1:23:06.470
I love you a lot, Rafal, but it's 4 am,

1:23:06.470 --> 1:23:08.573
let's just go to sleep.

1:23:12.232 --> 1:23:15.730
I can't bear you turning
your back against me.

1:23:15.730 --> 1:23:16.740
Switch sides of the bed with me,

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:18.630
so I can have you facing me.

1:23:18.630 --> 1:23:19.463
What?

1:23:22.530 --> 1:23:25.003
You take my side and I take yours.

1:23:26.671 --> 1:23:27.671
You have to face me.

1:23:29.550 --> 1:23:32.823
If you turn your back to me,
it means you don't love me.

1:23:32.823 --> 1:23:35.850
But that's crazy.

1:23:35.850 --> 1:23:37.493
Switch sides with me, Claire.

1:23:38.335 --> 1:23:41.002
You'd do it if you love me.

1:23:42.594 --> 1:23:43.869
Switch sides!

1:24:01.494 --> 1:24:03.119
Tha-that's better.

1:24:49.998 --> 1:24:51.907
Stop! Girls, stop!

1:24:51.907 --> 1:24:54.030
No, no, no, no, no.

1:24:54.030 --> 1:24:56.347
Give me that! No! Stop!

1:25:17.732 --> 1:25:19.871
May I have your attention, please...

1:25:19.871 --> 1:25:21.987
I DON'T LIKE THIS PUPPET SHOW!

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:27.162
Will you just-

1:25:28.559 --> 1:25:30.891
Give me that! Give me...

1:25:30.891 --> 1:25:34.622
Give, give me that! Give me that!

1:25:34.622 --> 1:25:37.372
Will you just give, give me!

1:25:37.372 --> 1:25:38.205
No!

1:25:42.164 --> 1:25:43.145
Give that!

1:25:47.617 --> 1:25:52.617
I hate you, you little shits!

1:26:44.921 --> 1:26:46.588
Who was that then?

1:27:19.430 --> 1:27:21.380
I brought my own stuff to throw, too.

1:27:26.305 --> 1:27:28.803
You're a good friend.

1:27:32.610 --> 1:27:34.527
I'm ready when you are.

1:27:37.070 --> 1:27:37.903
Ready.

1:27:42.910 --> 1:27:43.743
No more.

1:27:47.390 --> 1:27:49.413
No more!

1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:53.419
No more! I can't believe I just-

1:27:53.419 --> 1:27:54.730
- Hi-ya!
- Okay, Julia, you really

1:27:54.730 --> 1:27:57.567
don't have to-
- Hi-ya!

1:27:58.997 --> 1:28:01.746
Hi-ya!

1:28:03.610 --> 1:28:05.333
Okey dokey.

1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:21.720
So how are you getting to the airport?

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:26.220
Please, tell me you're not
taking a bus, buses have crud.

1:28:26.220 --> 1:28:27.530
Crud.

1:28:27.530 --> 1:28:29.243
Yes, Claire! Crud.

1:28:30.790 --> 1:28:33.740
One time, I read about
a girl who went on a bus

1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:37.640
and she contracted bus
crud, and then she died,

1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:40.510
and then it was made
into a Lifetime movie.

1:28:40.510 --> 1:28:43.530
Relax, I scheduled a car for30,

1:28:43.530 --> 1:28:46.520
and I'll be back to get
my luggage on the way.

1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:49.050
Oh my God, Claire,, what about skater boy?

1:28:49.050 --> 1:28:50.520
Did you tell him you're leaving?

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:54.973
No, he hates me, plus I'll
probably never see him again.

1:28:59.780 --> 1:29:00.613
Uh.

1:29:02.322 --> 1:29:03.155
Hi.

1:29:04.141 --> 1:29:04.974
Hi.

1:29:08.088 --> 1:29:09.296
Uh... how are you?

1:29:10.180 --> 1:29:11.013
Okay.

1:29:12.087 --> 1:29:12.920
Maybe.

1:29:14.210 --> 1:29:16.424
I'm actually about to leave France.

1:29:16.424 --> 1:29:17.327
Really?

1:29:17.327 --> 1:29:19.051
I'm going back to the US.

1:29:21.683 --> 1:29:22.567
For good?

1:29:22.567 --> 1:29:23.400
Yeah.

1:29:24.628 --> 1:29:25.461
Oh.

1:29:29.683 --> 1:29:31.933
Actually, Claire, I wanted to say...

1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:38.485
...You were saying?

1:29:44.089 --> 1:29:45.455
...I forgot. But, um...

1:29:47.638 --> 1:29:49.654
I wanted to say have a good trip,

1:29:51.871 --> 1:29:52.704
and...

1:29:53.756 --> 1:29:54.797
... good luck...

1:29:56.916 --> 1:29:57.749
And, um...

1:30:00.511 --> 1:30:02.585
...have, have a good trip, um...

1:30:12.822 --> 1:30:16.050
Actually, do you want to take a walk?

1:30:16.050 --> 1:30:17.696
Yeah.

1:30:17.696 --> 1:30:19.616
Yeah, I'd like that.

1:30:19.616 --> 1:30:20.449
Please.

1:30:28.552 --> 1:30:31.848
So what are you up to these days?

1:30:31.848 --> 1:30:33.773
Oh... nothing much, really.

1:30:35.441 --> 1:30:38.238
In a few days I'm taking
Trina to Portugal,

1:30:38.238 --> 1:30:39.548
for the weekend.

1:30:39.548 --> 1:30:41.784
We need some time together.

1:30:41.784 --> 1:30:42.892
It'll do us good.

1:30:43.878 --> 1:30:44.711
... maybe.

1:30:45.997 --> 1:30:47.972
You know, I still have your sock.

1:30:51.623 --> 1:30:54.006
Well, I did say you'd have it forever.

1:30:55.507 --> 1:30:57.434
Claire, actually, I have to say...

1:30:57.434 --> 1:30:58.267
I,

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.593
I wanted to say,

1:31:05.420 --> 1:31:07.440
I'm sorry for being an asshole.

1:31:11.030 --> 1:31:12.663
If I cared less, I would,

1:31:14.714 --> 1:31:17.937
I would probably let
you be closer, you know?

1:31:19.870 --> 1:31:22.962
But you'll never be far
from me, you understand?

1:31:28.501 --> 1:31:31.688
Phew, okay, that's enough of that.

1:31:31.688 --> 1:31:32.521
Um.

1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:35.753
I,

1:31:38.170 --> 1:31:41.653
I can't forget what you
say, even if I want to.

1:31:41.653 --> 1:31:45.677
How do you like, um, how do you say, um,

1:31:47.448 --> 1:31:48.865
une fee-marraine?

1:31:50.090 --> 1:31:51.810
A fairy godmother?

1:31:51.810 --> 1:31:53.840
Oui! Voila!

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:57.673
You're like a very
annoying fairy grandmother.

1:32:05.900 --> 1:32:08.003
Oh my God, that's my airport cab.

1:33:47.865 --> 1:33:49.448
Goodbye, Petrushka.

1:34:49.155 --> 1:34:52.070
... achieving more than two
million euros in turnover.

1:34:52.070 --> 1:34:54.612
So if they can finish out
this round of fundraising

1:34:54.612 --> 1:34:55.920
before the end of January,

1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:58.562
I think they'll bring their
capital to fifty million eur...

1:35:01.494 --> 1:35:02.927
... you okay, Thibaut?

1:35:03.785 --> 1:35:05.450
Hm?

1:35:05.450 --> 1:35:06.881
Um.

1:35:06.881 --> 1:35:08.364
Yes. Yeah, of course.

1:35:09.369 --> 1:35:11.244
Will you excuse me a minute?

1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:38.863
It's funny what moves some
people and not others.

1:35:41.530 --> 1:35:44.440
For some people, it's a meteor shower.

1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:47.190
For others, it's a math problem.

1:35:51.930 --> 1:35:53.788
For some, it's the night sky.

1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:58.300
And for others, it's the memory of a girl

1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:02.457
staring at you in the soul
and saying, "Do better."

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:09.120
And sometimes, the best you can do

1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:11.263
is to put that memory in a box,

1:36:12.968 --> 1:36:14.718
then leave it there.

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:19.447
And put yourself first for a change.

1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:20.230
Because what if the light
you saw in someone else

1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:26.100
was really your own light
reflected back at you?
