I can't believe it.

01:56.879 --> 01:58.008
Bob are you crying?

01:58.038 --> 01:59.878
What? No Sue.

01:59.908 --> 02:02.277
I've got an eyelash in my eye.
Oh.

02:02.307 --> 02:04.676
Look it's your first
16th birthday picture.

02:04.716 --> 02:06.545
Ech Dad.

02:06.575 --> 02:08.215
What? I like it.

02:08.245 --> 02:10.084
It's going to go

02:24.390 --> 02:26.329
I'm not a kid anymore.

02:26.359 --> 02:29.028

02:29.058 --> 02:30.998
I need my own space.

I've been looking forward
to this day all my life

02:33.097 --> 02:37.026

you would all just get out

02:42.504 --> 02:43.963
Love you.

04:06.716 --> 04:09.285

No you cannot have a loan.

05:12.256 --> 05:15.325
I have been saving up for
my Sweet 16 party tonight.

05:16.824 --> 05:19.023

05:28.030 --> 05:29.460
Yeah not really.

05:29.490 --> 05:32.200

you'd get all this today?

05:32.230 --> 05:34.358
I'm an essentially
hopeful person.

05:34.398 --> 05:36.897
The first one's hilarious.

05:40.736 --> 05:42.306
The Joey Lockhart.

05:42.336 --> 05:45.634
He's an international pop star
with about a bazillion fans.

05:45.664 --> 05:46.835
Why would you even wish that?

05:46.874 --> 05:49.174
I was 7.
You were delusional.

05:49.204 --> 05:53.273
You were 5
and wore a cape to school.

05:53.303 --> 05:57.971
The other wishes are more
realistic like wish number 3.

06:02.679 --> 06:06.278
No no no.

06:06.308 --> 06:07.878
Sassy.

06:10.247 --> 06:12.216
Mm not a good idea Abs.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.446
Why not?

06:13.486 --> 06:17.585
If you decorate your room
the way you dress ouch.

06:17.615 --> 06:18.715
Ucch.

06:18.755 --> 06:21.024
And what's with
the mug shot on 16?

06:21.054 --> 06:22.324
It's not a mug shot.

06:22.354 --> 06:24.492
It's Logan Buchanan.

06:24.522 --> 06:26.492
Your crushed
on the quarterback?

06:26.522 --> 06:27.762
How cliché.

06:27.792 --> 06:30.431
For your information
he's also in the drama club

06:30.461 --> 06:32.059
and once attended
Chess Masters.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.760
I know. I was there.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.269
He wanted to buy my chem notes.

06:35.299 --> 06:36.699
He's perfect.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.137
And if I get my wish
he'll talk to me today.

It's terrible.

06:55.632 --> 06:58.401
I don't know what I did

13:55.157 --> 13:57.086
Read wish number 8.

13:57.116 --> 13:59.086
"When I'm 16..."

14:01.585 --> 14:03.785
I'm lighting
one of these candles.

14:03.825 --> 14:05.653
What if something bad happens?

14:05.693 --> 14:07.293
What if something good happens?

14:07.324 --> 14:09.863
And look if it's a joke

14:09.893 --> 14:12.191
the worst that can happen
is we take the bus.

14:12.231 --> 14:13.231
Here.

14:35.404 --> 14:36.504
Ladies and gentlemen

14:36.544 --> 14:38.303
Joey Lockhart!

14:43.412 --> 14:44.982
You Abby Jensen?

14:46.111 --> 14:47.110
Yes.

Oh what just happened?

15:27.028 --> 15:30.636
I've had a crush on him
since I was 7.

15:30.666 --> 15:33.735
When I'm 16
I'll meet Joey Lockhart.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.035
What are you talking about?

15:35.066 --> 15:36.535
It's wish number 1.

15:36.565 --> 15:38.504
Look Jay. The candles work.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.903
Yeah but we're still
stuck taking the bus.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.402
Maybe not.

15:45.442 --> 15:49.171
I lit candle number 1 and wish
number 1 on my list came true.

15:49.211 --> 15:50.910
I think the numbers
on the candles

15:50.940 --> 15:53.639
correspond with the numbers
on my wish list.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.108
Give me number 8.

16:02.416 --> 16:06.486
When I'm 16 I'll have
my own car preferably red.

16:10.255 --> 16:11.383
No way.

16:11.424 --> 16:12.724
Way.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.551
Check it out.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.451
Gosh this is fun.

16:21.491 --> 16:24.290
I can't believe it.
This is my dream car.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.088
It's all yours sweetie.
Want to drive?

16:26.128 --> 16:27.358
Yes.
No.

16:27.388 --> 16:29.088
Come on. I have my permit.

16:29.128 --> 16:30.298
My dad lets me practice

16:30.328 --> 16:31.797
in the Hasty Mart
parking lot all the time.

16:31.827 --> 16:34.326
Yeah at midnight
when it's empty.

16:34.366 --> 16:36.796
Abby when a total stranger
drives up to you on the street

16:36.836 --> 16:38.864
and offers you a car
you can't just take it.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.704
She's not a total stranger.
You look very familiar.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.633
Well we're not doing this.

16:43.663 --> 16:45.533
Why not?
Yeah why not?

16:45.573 --> 16:48.701
Because...
you don't have a driver's license

16:48.741 --> 16:50.171
until you take the test
after school.

16:50.201 --> 16:53.310
Good point. I'll drive.
You two get in.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.969
What? Not until you
tell us who you are.

16:55.009 --> 16:58.338
I'm Celeste. I'm here to make
Abby's 16 wishes come true.

16:58.378 --> 17:02.547
Oh. Well that explains
pretty much exactly nothing.

17:02.577 --> 17:04.077
Come on Jay.

17:04.107 --> 17:08.046
This is the most wonderful
amazing magical thing

17:08.076 --> 17:09.214
that's ever happened to me.

17:09.244 --> 17:12.643
50 years from now when you're
looking back at your life

17:12.683 --> 17:14.314
don't you want
to be able to say

17:14.354 --> 17:16.412
you had the guts
to get in the car?

17:19.852 --> 17:21.021
I'm going to regret this.

17:21.050 --> 17:24.849
Yes! Get your stuff.
Come on. Get in the car.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.689
All right go go go.

17:30.828 --> 17:34.227
Just so we're clear you're
some kind of magical being

17:34.257 --> 17:35.556
like an elf or a fairy?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.326
Sure. Why not?

17:37.356 --> 17:39.565
You don't sound so sure.
Jay.

17:39.595 --> 17:41.064
You just do birthdays
or other events too?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.524
He babbles when he's nervous.

17:42.564 --> 17:46.063
Why don't you relax Jay
and enjoy the ride?

17:47.302 --> 17:49.233
Hold on.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.401
Yahoo!

17:52.431 --> 17:55.340
Whoa! Mommy!

17:58.010 --> 17:59.409
Whoo!

18:00.469 --> 18:01.908
That was awesome.

18:01.938 --> 18:03.608
Have we landed yet?
What's it look like?

18:03.638 --> 18:05.276
What does what look like?
Her home planet.

18:05.306 --> 18:06.837
Sorry Jay.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.775
The only alien planet you'll be
visiting today is high school.

18:14.944 --> 18:16.712
I already have my license.

18:16.742 --> 18:18.912
My dad has connections
at the DMV.

18:20.042 --> 18:23.181
Yo Logan check out that ride.

18:28.819 --> 18:30.749
Hey Jensen did you
get new wheels too?

18:30.789 --> 18:32.358
Uh...

18:36.726 --> 18:38.926
Yeah. These are my new wheels

18:38.956 --> 18:45.894
which I bought myself for
my birthday which is today.

18:45.934 --> 18:46.934
Cool.

18:48.463 --> 18:50.202
No way this is yours.

18:50.232 --> 18:51.362
What can I say?

18:51.402 --> 18:53.302
I'm a saver
not a spender like you.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.601
Oh man.

18:54.631 --> 18:56.471
I got to make some bank.

19:08.307 --> 19:09.477
Umm...

19:10.506 --> 19:11.545
What are you doing?

19:11.575 --> 19:13.075
Saving you from more
humiliation.

19:13.115 --> 19:14.744
What?
I'm not humiliated.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.414
This is the best birthday ever.

19:16.444 --> 19:17.813
Look. Wish number 15.

19:17.843 --> 19:20.713
When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.183
If the candles keep
working like this

19:22.213 --> 19:24.181
my party's going to be sick.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.850
Hey party tonight at my house.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.180
You're all invited.

19:35.657 --> 19:37.258
Come on.

19:37.288 --> 19:38.387
Come on. It's okay.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.957
It's okay.

19:48.534 --> 19:49.593
Want to make some cash?

19:49.633 --> 19:50.833
Yes.

19:50.863 --> 19:52.162
Put these up everywhere.

19:52.202 --> 19:55.331
Meet me at the voting table
after first period.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.669
Okay. You go find
some real clothes to wear.

20:02.699 --> 20:04.869
I'll tell Miss Hackl
you got a late time okay?

20:04.908 --> 20:05.909
Thanks Jay.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.946
Ugh.

20:14.976 --> 20:15.975
Ew.

20:21.613 --> 20:23.112
When I'm 16...

20:28.521 --> 20:31.590
For me? Thank you.

20:38.927 --> 20:39.957
Okay.

20:43.226 --> 20:45.956
Wish number 2. All right.

20:51.064 --> 20:52.133
Okay.

21:01.870 --> 21:03.029
What?

21:14.076 --> 21:15.815
What's going on?

21:15.845 --> 21:17.415
Come on.

21:21.784 --> 21:23.143
Uh Miss Duffy.

21:23.183 --> 21:24.483
Jensen.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.752
I'll take that.

21:37.449 --> 21:40.817
Keep it up Theodore and
you'll be president one day.

21:40.847 --> 21:42.077
You really think so?

21:42.117 --> 21:43.246
Absolutely.

21:43.286 --> 21:44.286
Ohh!

21:46.915 --> 21:48.155
So you can tell the future too?

21:48.185 --> 21:49.915
Oh no. Just gave Ted hope.

21:49.955 --> 21:50.984
Come on in.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.892
So what's up sweetie?

21:55.922 --> 21:57.892
What's up?
You know what's up.

21:57.922 --> 22:00.591
That's why you're here pretending
to be the counselor.

22:00.621 --> 22:02.521
Why didn't that
stupid candle light?

22:02.561 --> 22:04.190
Because of the rules.

22:04.220 --> 22:06.189
The rules?

22:06.219 --> 22:08.819
Oh boy. You don't
get out much do you?

22:08.859 --> 22:10.088
What are you talking about?

22:10.128 --> 22:12.897
The candles are magic
and all magic has rules.

22:12.927 --> 22:15.696
One candle
and one wish per hour.

22:15.726 --> 22:17.925
You lit candle number 1
at 7:58 this morning

22:17.965 --> 22:19.765
and Joey Lockhart showed up.

22:19.795 --> 22:23.094
Then you lit candle number 8
at precisely 8 A.M.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.274
Your wishes were two minutes apart
but within different hours.

22:26.304 --> 22:29.033
Oh. So now I have to wait...

22:29.073 --> 22:31.702
- 27 minutes. - ...
before I make another wish.

22:31.742 --> 22:34.410
Great. You could have printed
that on the box you know.

22:35.739 --> 22:38.238
Any other magic candle rules
I should know about?

22:38.278 --> 22:41.248
Only one but it's a doozy.

22:41.278 --> 22:44.077
The magic in the candles
expires at midnight tonight

22:44.117 --> 22:46.347
so no more wishes after then.

22:46.387 --> 22:49.556
Oh and all the wishes you've
made by then become permanent.

22:49.586 --> 22:51.355
At midnight.
Yeah.

22:51.385 --> 22:54.484
So at midnight that gorgeous
car out there is mine forever?

22:54.524 --> 22:55.653
Absolutely.

22:55.693 --> 22:59.722
And in 26 1/2 minutes I'll have
cuter clothes than Krista Cook.

22:59.762 --> 23:01.621
Yeah.

23:01.661 --> 23:03.731
She really can't stand you.

23:03.761 --> 23:05.390
Oh.

23:05.430 --> 23:06.700
You know about that?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.868
I shouldn't do this but...

23:16.006 --> 23:17.236
Read for yourself.

23:17.266 --> 23:19.865
♪ Oh yeah ♪

23:19.905 --> 23:22.935
Oh no.

23:22.975 --> 23:24.505
I couldn't.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.033
Well maybe just a page or two.

23:26.073 --> 23:28.502
I suggest 10 23 and 37.

23:29.643 --> 23:30.712
Oh.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.810
Be a little more careful where
you light those puppies.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.110
Thanks.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.579
Hmm.

23:48.556 --> 23:49.916
Whoa.

23:49.956 --> 23:51.355
Good stuff?

23:51.385 --> 23:53.924
You have no idea.

24:03.391 --> 24:05.461
Thanks for voting for me.

24:05.501 --> 24:06.901
Krista!

24:06.931 --> 24:10.129
I know you've loathed me
since we were 8 years old

24:10.169 --> 24:12.268
but I didn't know
you've been keeping score.

24:12.298 --> 24:14.468
Where did you get that?

24:14.498 --> 24:15.898
From the Birthday Fairy.

24:15.938 --> 24:18.067
Right. Give it to me.

24:18.107 --> 24:20.836
When we were 10
I had my first sleepover

24:20.866 --> 24:22.266
so you decided to have one too

24:22.306 --> 24:25.005
but you paid everybody
to come to yours.

24:26.473 --> 24:28.773
You have no right
to read that. It's mine.

24:28.803 --> 24:30.643
Well then why
is it all about me?

24:31.642 --> 24:34.771
When we were 12 I entered
the school talent show

24:34.811 --> 24:36.041
with my baton twirling act.

24:36.081 --> 24:38.710
So you entered too
juggli 12 batons.

24:38.750 --> 24:39.780
Sync by Hana.Bean
www.Addic7ed.Com

24:39.810 --> 24:42.279
Every year you' competed with
me and every year you've won.

24:42.309 --> 24:44.149
You've tortured me
since the grade.

24:44.179 --> 24:45.318
Can you just give it a rest?

24:45.349 --> 24:47.117
Don't play innocent with me.

24:47.147 --> 24:48.647
You know what you did.

24:48.687 --> 24:51.787
And for this I'm going to make
sure nobody comes to your party.

24:51.817 --> 24:53.985
Here.

24:54.015 --> 24:55.114
What's this?

24:55.154 --> 24:57.984
It's an invitation to my Sweet
16 birthday party tonight.

24:58.024 --> 24:59.484
Everybody's going to be there.

24:59.524 --> 25:03.791
Now if you'll excuse me I
have some campaigning to do.

25:03.821 --> 25:05.492
Krista you don't
need to campaign.

25:05.522 --> 25:08.691
You're the only name on the
ballot running for president.

25:08.731 --> 25:10.389
Well then I'm sure to win.

25:10.430 --> 25:11.860
Why are you doing this?

25:11.900 --> 25:13.199
You're not even interested
in student government.

25:13.229 --> 25:14.499
And you are?

25:14.529 --> 25:17.758
Well I... I didn't think so.

25:17.798 --> 25:19.198
Ahem.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.697
Hey Krista.

25:22.066 --> 25:24.435
So they said you needed
help with something?

25:24.465 --> 25:25.865
Hand these out for me.

25:25.895 --> 25:27.234
Sure.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.235
Thanks.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.172
She's doing it.
She's ruining my birthday.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.271
Again.

25:36.301 --> 25:39.371
Just don't let her get to you.

25:39.401 --> 25:40.941
You're right Jay.

25:40.971 --> 25:43.610
I'm going to put an end
to her reign of terror.

25:45.008 --> 25:48.408
Right about now.

26:06.492 --> 26:08.231
List. Hurry.

26:20.738 --> 26:24.667
When I'm 16 I'll have
the cutest clothes in school.

26:27.935 --> 26:29.935
Hi-hi.

26:29.975 --> 26:32.634
Celeste it's beautiful.

26:32.673 --> 26:33.804
I know right?

26:33.843 --> 26:35.973
I've been waiting for you
to make this wish.

26:36.003 --> 26:38.972
I just love shopping
especially when it's free.

26:39.012 --> 26:40.741
I don't even know
where to start.

26:40.781 --> 26:42.181
That's what I'm here for.

26:42.211 --> 26:44.740
Now close your eyes
and let me work my magic.

26:46.249 --> 26:49.448
Ever since the third grade
whatever I did Krista did better.

26:49.478 --> 26:52.847
She's never satisfied unless
she's winning and I'm losing.

26:52.887 --> 26:56.586
But today I decided she's t going
to make me miserable anymore.

26:58.015 --> 27:02.784
I have a plan and this
wish it's the first part.

27:02.824 --> 27:04.353
Would you say
Krista Cook always has

27:04.393 --> 27:05.754
the cutest clothes in school?

27:05.794 --> 27:07.762
And shoes and handbags.

27:09.221 --> 27:10.992
Not anymore.

27:26.805 --> 27:29.205
That top is not an original
you-know-who is it?

27:29.235 --> 27:31.175
It is.

27:31.205 --> 27:32.344
Shut up.

27:32.374 --> 27:34.404
Oh those shoes
are so to die for.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.243
I hate you.

27:36.273 --> 27:37.543
Want to have lunch near us?

27:37.573 --> 27:38.742
Sure.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.841
Yay. I totally just want to
sit next to that handbag.

27:41.881 --> 27:43.910
You mean this handbag?

27:45.881 --> 27:49.379
I got it for my birthday last year.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.979
You're not all that Jensen.

27:55.716 --> 27:56.886
Yoo-hoo Abby!

27:57.986 --> 27:59.686
I'm so sorry.

27:59.726 --> 28:01.285
Give me that old thing.

28:01.325 --> 28:05.493
This one's so hot it
hasn't even come out yet.

28:05.523 --> 28:07.223
Thank you so much.

28:07.263 --> 28:09.823
I'll just ship you
the rest of the collection

28:09.863 --> 28:11.562
when the infestation's over.

28:11.592 --> 28:13.061
Auf Wiedersehen.

28:27.836 --> 28:30.705
I know what you're doing
and it's not going to work.

28:32.175 --> 28:35.035
I'm just trying to have the best
birthday of my entire life.

28:35.074 --> 28:37.574
Well good luck with that
because it's not over yet.

28:59.685 --> 29:02.655
All right everybody.
On the track in five.

29:02.685 --> 29:04.714
Late again Jensen.

29:06.754 --> 29:09.153
Yes Miss Duffy I am late.

29:09.183 --> 29:12.092
I had to go back to my locker
for this.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.991
I see.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.461
That's still no excuse
for tardiness

29:16.491 --> 29:18.960
but that is a beautiful bag.

29:20.030 --> 29:21.400
It's for you.

29:21.429 --> 29:23.458
Me?
Mm-hmm.

29:23.498 --> 29:25.169
I was saving it
for your Christmas present

29:25.199 --> 29:29.897
but look it matches
your track suit perfectly.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.407
Ha ha! It actually does.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.335
Happy Monday.

29:32.365 --> 29:34.604
Well Happy Monday to me.

29:34.634 --> 29:38.804
Well ladies what do you say
instead of running killer laps

29:38.844 --> 29:41.233
we all have a nice friendly
game of volleyball?

29:42.903 --> 29:43.972
Way to go Abby.

Come on. We need her.

30:08.524 --> 30:09.623
Jensen!

30:09.653 --> 30:11.654
Get out here!

30:15.292 --> 30:20.191
When I'm 16 I'll beat Krista
at something anything.

30:20.231 --> 30:21.960
Everything.

Play ball!

30:54.479 --> 30:56.278
You sure you're ready for this?

30:56.318 --> 30:57.949
Why shouldn't I be sure?

30:57.979 --> 31:00.288
Because you're the least
athletic person I know.

31:00.318 --> 31:03.117
Not anymore.
I got the birthday mojo.

31:03.147 --> 31:04.785
Duck!

31:04.815 --> 31:06.656
1-zip.

31:06.686 --> 31:08.985
You tried to hit me.

31:09.025 --> 31:12.393
It's called spiking.
It's how you win.

31:13.522 --> 31:15.263
Play ball!

31:44.244 --> 31:46.643
MVP! MVP!

31:46.673 --> 31:48.541
Hey are you all right?

31:48.571 --> 31:50.812
I'm going
to call the nurse okay?

31:50.842 --> 31:51.941
Stay here.

31:51.981 --> 31:56.179
MVP! MVP! MVP!

32:04.047 --> 32:05.687
Oh well look who's awake.

32:07.816 --> 32:08.914
How are you feeling?

32:08.954 --> 32:10.455
I'm fine.

32:10.485 --> 32:12.194
I had a weird nightmare.

32:12.224 --> 32:15.623
Oh honey that was real.
Abby Jensen creamed you.

32:15.663 --> 32:17.522
Oh and you're wanted
in the principal's office.

32:25.730 --> 32:26.700
Run along.

32:30.469 --> 32:34.338
Yeah that's so true.
That's so true.

32:35.937 --> 32:37.336
Makes my day.
Yeah.

32:37.376 --> 32:39.075
You wanted to see me
Mr. Smith?

32:39.105 --> 32:41.374
Yeah. Yeah.

32:41.414 --> 32:45.143
Ms. Cook
the election's over.

32:45.183 --> 32:48.183
How can it be over?
A lot of people haven't voted yet.

32:49.313 --> 32:53.621
Actually we had a 100% voter turnout.

32:55.750 --> 32:57.420
Whoop! Ooh!

32:57.460 --> 32:58.689
What's going on here?

33:03.598 --> 33:08.396
Good morning students!

33:08.426 --> 33:10.395
I'm very pleased to announce

33:10.435 --> 33:14.064
the winner of the most votes
for the Student Body President

33:14.104 --> 33:18.134
is Abby Jensen!

33:20.472 --> 33:21.972
Yes!

33:23.342 --> 33:25.811
I just want to thank
everyone who voted for me

33:25.841 --> 33:27.241
and made this dream possible.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.570
No. It's not possible.

33:29.610 --> 33:31.538
Her name isn't
even on the ballots!

33:33.638 --> 33:37.277
Let... go.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.415
That is all.

33:43.445 --> 33:45.214
Whoa. Wow.
You all right?

33:45.244 --> 33:46.754
Abby was a write-in.

33:53.621 --> 33:55.752
Better luck next time Krista.

34:21.831 --> 34:22.900
Ha!

34:22.931 --> 34:24.902
I finally beat Krista Cook.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.170
Had a little help.

34:26.201 --> 34:28.500
I know. Isn't it amazing?

34:28.530 --> 34:30.330
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

34:30.370 --> 34:31.599
Yeah for you.

34:31.639 --> 34:32.639
I know right?

34:36.638 --> 34:37.637
Can we just do this experiment?

34:37.667 --> 34:39.036
We both need extra credit.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.235
Nah.

34:40.275 --> 34:43.205
I'll just give the teacher some
strappy sandals and a pashmina.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.174
No. Just give it a rest.

34:46.204 --> 34:48.344
What's wrong with you?

34:48.375 --> 34:49.973
I don't know.
This whole wish thing.

34:50.013 --> 34:51.672
You're changing too fast Abby.

34:51.712 --> 34:53.012
I can't keep up.

34:53.042 --> 34:54.342
What do you mean?

34:54.382 --> 34:57.152
You've always been
allergic to volunteer work.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.280
And now all of a sudden
you're Student Body President?

34:59.310 --> 35:00.549
What can I say?

35:00.579 --> 35:03.549
The people spoke
and they wanted me.

35:03.579 --> 35:07.288
The candles spoke and you have no
idea what you just wished for.

35:07.318 --> 35:08.518
Yes I do.

35:08.558 --> 35:11.986
Being president
is like an honor.

35:12.016 --> 35:14.656
Being president is
an important job Abby.

35:14.686 --> 35:16.625
It should do to someone
who really wants it.

35:16.655 --> 35:19.624
Oh like who? Like Krista?

35:19.654 --> 35:20.654
No.

35:21.863 --> 35:24.122
Well I'm sure
I'll do just fine.

35:24.162 --> 35:26.162
I'll have you to help me.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.462
Come on.
You can't be mad at me.

35:28.492 --> 35:29.590
Why not?

35:29.631 --> 35:31.700
Because it's my birthday.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.598
Because we're best friends.

35:38.568 --> 35:43.867
Because I'm Student Body President
and I get free lunch. Ta-da!

35:44.976 --> 35:46.006
No way.

35:46.036 --> 35:48.505
Way way. Every day.

35:48.545 --> 35:51.344
Now hand over
your goofy glasses

35:51.374 --> 35:54.412
and let your commander in chief
buy you a sandwich.

35:55.841 --> 35:56.912
What kind of sandwich?

35:56.951 --> 35:59.251
Any kind you want.

36:05.659 --> 36:07.119
Come on.

36:07.159 --> 36:08.988
There she is!

36:10.557 --> 36:13.796
You see? Ha ha.
They love me.

36:13.826 --> 36:15.496
What have you done now?

36:15.526 --> 36:17.695
Wish number 10.

36:18.696 --> 36:21.764
I looked in the mirror and I
was tired of being invisible.

36:21.794 --> 36:24.463
When I'm 16 I'll be popular.

36:24.493 --> 36:26.033
Oh hi Joey.

36:26.063 --> 36:28.401
Abby smile!

36:28.431 --> 36:30.362
Sure I'll sign it.

36:33.470 --> 36:35.000
I loved that wish.

36:35.030 --> 36:36.500
Right.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.506
Okay people make a hole!

36:43.536 --> 36:44.666
Here she comes!

36:44.706 --> 36:45.736
Back up. Come on.

36:45.776 --> 36:47.336
Move your hair.
Thank you. Okay.

36:47.376 --> 36:48.534
Peeps.

36:51.844 --> 36:53.474
And I don't have to do a thing.

36:53.514 --> 36:54.713
Just show up.

36:54.743 --> 36:56.843
They're planning
your birthday party.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.312
Mm-hmm.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.910
Their dads
are business partners.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.951
Apparently
they own half of Vegas.

37:04.981 --> 37:06.849
They're throwing my party
at one of their hotels.

37:08.049 --> 37:11.777
Not to rain on your birthday
parade Abs but Vegas?

37:11.817 --> 37:14.118
That's not really your style.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.716
And your basement is?

37:15.746 --> 37:17.546
Hey I have foosball.

37:17.586 --> 37:19.815
Good point.

37:19.855 --> 37:23.353
Look this is my one and only
Sweet 16 birthday party.

37:23.383 --> 37:25.893
I... I want it to be
spectacular.

37:28.462 --> 37:30.002
I don't have anything to wear.

37:30.032 --> 37:31.871
Well we both have
a free period right now.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.801
Let's go buy you a dress.

37:33.841 --> 37:37.699
We can't. The wasps are holding
my party money hostage.

37:37.739 --> 37:38.909
I'll supply you the cash.

37:38.939 --> 37:40.568
You'd do that?

37:40.608 --> 37:41.708
Sure.

37:41.738 --> 37:44.007
Jay you're the best.

37:58.382 --> 38:00.213
We can't go.

38:00.243 --> 38:02.451
I don't have my license yet.

38:05.621 --> 38:08.120
A reading from the Wish List
of Abigail Jensen.

38:08.150 --> 38:11.088
Wish number 7... When I'm 16...

38:36.800 --> 38:39.210
Abigail Louise Jensen?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.680
Yes.

38:41.709 --> 38:43.708
This is highly unusual.

38:50.177 --> 38:53.385
My driver's license!

38:53.415 --> 38:55.585
And there ya go.

38:55.615 --> 38:57.313
Thank you so much!

39:04.322 --> 39:05.591
Oh lighten up Harry.

39:05.621 --> 39:08.460
You needed to get out of
that cubicle anyway.

39:08.490 --> 39:10.230
But we really don't
do this kind of thing.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.489
I know.

39:11.529 --> 39:13.928
But wasn't it fun?

39:13.958 --> 39:16.228
My cubicle was fun.

39:44.449 --> 39:47.348
This is now officially
the best 16th birthday

39:47.388 --> 39:50.687
in the history
of 16th birthdays.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.155
Abby you can't afford
a hanger here.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.485
Not true.

39:56.525 --> 39:58.024
Since I don't have
to pay for my own party

39:58.054 --> 40:00.583
I'm spending every penny I
saved on the perfect dress.

40:02.853 --> 40:03.852
Come on!

40:11.861 --> 40:13.689
What do you think?
It's nice.

40:13.729 --> 40:16.468
No. Too disco.

40:26.036 --> 40:28.005
What about this one?

40:28.035 --> 40:32.343
You're... It's beautiful.

40:32.373 --> 40:34.913
But do you think Logan
will like it?

40:34.943 --> 40:36.472
How should I know?

40:36.511 --> 40:37.582
Touchy.

40:37.612 --> 40:39.210
Why don't you just light
No. 16 right now

40:39.241 --> 40:40.641
and make the stupid wish?

40:40.681 --> 40:42.310
Poof.
Logan Buchanan is yours.

40:42.350 --> 40:43.280
It doesn't work that way.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.579
Uh yes it does.

40:44.619 --> 40:46.279
It's worked that way all day.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.448
I want Logan to like me for me

40:48.478 --> 40:52.417
not because I put some magic
birthday spell on him.

40:52.447 --> 40:53.816
I'm trying this on.

40:56.685 --> 40:57.985
And these.

41:18.529 --> 41:21.897
I'll take these.

41:21.927 --> 41:23.867
I really feel for you.

41:23.897 --> 41:27.196
Wasting your time on kids
like that.

41:27.236 --> 41:28.435
A customer's a customer.

41:28.465 --> 41:30.535
Oh trust me.

41:30.564 --> 41:34.263
They won't be buying anything.

41:34.303 --> 41:36.973
Look Jay.
It's perfect isn't it?

41:37.003 --> 41:38.572
Sure.

41:38.602 --> 41:41.641
Well I love it and I think
Logan's going to love it too.

41:41.671 --> 41:43.341
Good. Sold.

41:43.371 --> 41:45.209
Can we go now?

41:45.239 --> 41:47.939
Don't be so grumpy.

41:47.979 --> 41:49.078
I'm sorry.

41:49.108 --> 41:51.178
This is a store
not a playground.

41:51.218 --> 41:52.847
Exactly.

41:52.887 --> 41:53.946
I like this one.

41:53.986 --> 41:55.216
I'm sure you do.

41:55.256 --> 41:57.456
Why don't you kids just come
back with your parents?

41:57.486 --> 41:59.755
We're not kids. I'm 16.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.125
Congratulations.

42:01.155 --> 42:02.185
Now give me the dress.

42:02.225 --> 42:04.123
No we're buying it!

42:04.153 --> 42:06.163
Jay show her your money.

42:09.992 --> 42:13.461
My wallet... You out.

42:13.501 --> 42:15.600
Hey!
You can't do that!

42:15.630 --> 42:17.070
Watch me.

42:18.869 --> 42:19.899
But we're customers!

42:19.939 --> 42:21.298
No you're children.

42:21.338 --> 42:23.967
Get that dress off now.

42:42.682 --> 42:44.951
Wish number 9...

42:56.827 --> 43:01.665
When I'm 16 people will
stop treating me like a kid.

43:13.871 --> 43:16.370
When I'm 16 people will stop
treating me like a kid.

43:31.016 --> 43:34.785
Um excuse me where's my friend?

43:34.815 --> 43:36.584
There was a boy here

43:36.614 --> 43:39.353
but he left with a girl in
the cutest little yellow car...

43:39.383 --> 43:42.012
Wait. He left with Krista?

43:42.051 --> 43:43.722
It appears so.

43:43.752 --> 43:46.791
Turn around.

43:46.821 --> 43:48.250
That outfit is all wrong.

43:48.290 --> 43:49.920
It's far too young for you.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.719
And suddenly really tight.

43:51.759 --> 43:55.388
Let's get you into something
more age appropriate.

43:55.428 --> 43:58.827
Let's try these.

43:58.857 --> 44:01.596
But I don't have any money.

44:01.626 --> 44:05.095
Oh we'll just put them
on your charge account.

44:05.135 --> 44:09.233
I have a charge account?

44:09.263 --> 44:10.932
Is everything all right
Miss Jensen?

44:10.962 --> 44:12.202
Oh yeah.

44:12.232 --> 44:16.502
Everything is just fine.

Sorry Miss Duffy.

45:01.717 --> 45:04.475
Do we know each other?

45:04.515 --> 45:06.044
Yeah.

45:06.084 --> 45:07.785
Ah you're the new
substitute teacher

45:07.815 --> 45:10.714
which means I don't have to
babysit those little monsters.

45:10.754 --> 45:12.853
They're all yours.

45:30.897 --> 45:32.826
Psssst!

45:46.413 --> 45:47.842
Psssst! Jay!

45:54.110 --> 45:56.348
I'll be right back.

45:56.379 --> 45:57.949
Oh great.

45:57.979 --> 45:59.917
Leave me to wrangle
the Blob all alone.

46:01.547 --> 46:03.187
Okay go.

46:10.384 --> 46:11.524
Yes?

46:11.554 --> 46:12.624
Get out here!

46:15.393 --> 46:16.692
What's wrong with you?

46:16.722 --> 46:18.092
Excuse me?

46:18.122 --> 46:20.931
You left me stranded
on my birthday.

46:20.961 --> 46:22.961
What kind of a best friend
does that?

46:23.001 --> 46:25.400
Best friend?
What are you talking about?

46:25.430 --> 46:27.099
Oh hi.
My name is Abby Jensen.

46:27.129 --> 46:29.069
Have we met?

46:29.099 --> 46:31.598
Yeah.
A long time ago I think.

46:31.638 --> 46:32.597
Shut up.

46:32.637 --> 46:34.237
Stop it.

46:34.267 --> 46:35.206
I'm not your best friend.

46:35.237 --> 46:40.475
I'm a sophomore.
You're a... woman.

46:40.505 --> 46:43.104
Thank you but I'm just
four months older than you.

46:43.144 --> 46:45.142
Yeah in dog years.

46:45.172 --> 46:47.813
Listen I'm in the middle of
an important experiment...

46:47.843 --> 46:49.782
And I'm in the middle of
an important birthday!

46:49.812 --> 46:51.151
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

46:51.181 --> 46:54.880
No wait... Let go.

46:59.349 --> 47:00.319
Jay Kepler!

47:00.359 --> 47:02.418
You're the worst
best friend ever!

47:04.387 --> 47:05.457
I don't understand.

47:05.487 --> 47:07.486
Am I being expelled?

47:07.526 --> 47:10.795
I'm sure they'll
explain everything.

47:10.825 --> 47:12.594
Mom? Dad?

47:12.624 --> 47:14.324
What's the truck for?

47:14.364 --> 47:16.333
Are we moving?

47:16.363 --> 47:17.632
Just come with us.

47:17.662 --> 47:19.802
Not until somebody tells me
what's going on?

47:22.731 --> 47:25.100
Abby you can't go to
high school anymore.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.499
What? Why not?

47:26.539 --> 47:27.669
Because it's time you grow up.

47:27.709 --> 47:28.968
Bob.
What?

47:29.008 --> 47:30.338
Sweetheart while the
house is being fumigated

47:30.379 --> 47:31.678
there just really
isn't room for you.

47:31.708 --> 47:34.677
So your dad and I were talking...
We found you an apartment...

47:34.707 --> 47:35.977
A what?

47:36.007 --> 47:37.117
An apartment.

47:37.147 --> 47:38.846
To live in.

47:38.876 --> 47:40.515
By myself?

47:53.251 --> 47:54.691
It's a very safe neighborhood.

47:54.721 --> 47:55.860
Is that what you call it?

47:55.890 --> 47:57.290
I call it pricey.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.189
Your dad and I paid
the security deposit

47:59.230 --> 48:01.959
but the first month's rent
is your responsibility.

48:08.467 --> 48:11.096
Okay I'll get the last load.

48:11.136 --> 48:12.465
You're going to need
a full-time job.

48:12.495 --> 48:13.765
I circled some good ones...

48:13.805 --> 48:16.703
What? No. I can't go
to school and have a job.

48:16.733 --> 48:19.232
Oh well if you're ready
for college... Bob!

48:19.273 --> 48:20.503
Yeah!

48:20.543 --> 48:21.542
She wants to go to college!

48:21.572 --> 48:22.971
No not yet!

48:23.001 --> 48:23.942
Never mind.

48:23.972 --> 48:25.041
Okay.

48:25.071 --> 48:26.671
Mom I'm just a kid!

48:26.711 --> 48:28.370
I can't live here by myself!

48:28.410 --> 48:29.680
Abby don't be so dramatic.

48:29.710 --> 48:31.880
Lots of girls your age
have their own apartments.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.208
I moved out when I was 18.

48:34.248 --> 48:35.408
But I'm not 18.

48:35.448 --> 48:36.577
No you're 21.

48:36.617 --> 48:37.577
22 today.

48:37.617 --> 48:39.417
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

48:39.447 --> 48:41.186
What are you talking about?

48:41.216 --> 48:42.515
Let's go Sue.

48:42.555 --> 48:44.015
No! Don't go!

48:44.055 --> 48:47.125
Just remember we did this out
of love... Yeah tough love.

48:47.155 --> 48:49.183
Bob!

48:49.223 --> 48:50.653
You'll be fine Pumpkin.

48:50.693 --> 48:52.662
Dad Dad...

48:55.032 --> 49:01.969
Mom...
Come and visit anytime.

49:01.999 --> 49:03.269
Except Wednesdays.

49:03.299 --> 49:05.537
Wednesday is our bowling night.

49:15.905 --> 49:17.744
High school memories?

49:45.156 --> 49:47.125
No.

49:47.155 --> 49:48.194
When I'm 16...

49:52.563 --> 49:56.492
Let's get you into something
more age-appropriate.

49:56.532 --> 49:57.791
You're the new substitute
teacher.

49:57.831 --> 49:59.531
Stop it!
I'm not your best friend.

49:59.561 --> 50:00.400
I'm a sophomore.

50:00.430 --> 50:03.359
You're a...
woman.

50:03.399 --> 50:04.429
No you're 21.

50:04.469 --> 50:06.128
22 today.

50:06.168 --> 50:08.867
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

50:08.897 --> 50:10.067
Oh no.

50:10.097 --> 50:11.337
No no no.

50:11.367 --> 50:13.507
This isn't what I wanted!

50:22.144 --> 50:24.472
Celeste!

50:24.512 --> 50:27.971
Celeste I need to talk to you!

50:28.011 --> 50:30.181
Right now!

50:33.450 --> 50:34.980
The list.

50:37.749 --> 50:41.547
There's gotta be a wish.

50:41.587 --> 50:44.286
That's it! Wish number 3.

50:44.316 --> 50:46.146
That should do it.

50:50.054 --> 50:54.724
When I'm 16 I'll decorate
my room the way I want.

50:59.021 --> 51:00.221
Yoo-hoo!

51:01.690 --> 51:02.930
Decorator's Delight!

51:02.960 --> 51:06.160
Celeste!
I'm so glad you're here... Me too.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.098
Okay. Nice.

51:08.128 --> 51:10.168
Lots of potential.

51:10.198 --> 51:11.867
I need your help.
You sure do.

51:11.897 --> 51:14.396
Maybe some wallpaper...
No no wallpaper.

51:14.436 --> 51:15.895
Paint then.

51:15.935 --> 51:16.895
Let's look at some samples.

51:16.935 --> 51:18.036
No listen to me.

51:18.066 --> 51:19.765
Your magic candles
made a mistake.

51:19.805 --> 51:20.934
Candles don't make mistakes.

51:20.964 --> 51:22.604
People do.

51:22.634 --> 51:25.503
I made a wish but it
wasn't really my wish.

51:25.533 --> 51:27.303
How about some curtains?

51:27.343 --> 51:28.441
No!

51:28.471 --> 51:29.542
Oo bad decision.

51:29.572 --> 51:30.571
You need privacy.

51:30.601 --> 51:31.401
You're alone.

51:31.441 --> 51:33.610
You're a woman... No I'm not!

51:33.640 --> 51:34.570
I'm not a woman!

51:34.610 --> 51:35.940
I'm 16 years old!

51:35.980 --> 51:40.778
I made a wish... wish number 9.

51:40.808 --> 51:42.047
I didn't want to be an adult!

51:42.077 --> 51:44.547
I just wanted to be
treated like one!

51:44.577 --> 51:46.117
The candles have
their own logic.

51:46.147 --> 51:47.387
They don't always give you
what you want.

51:47.417 --> 51:48.916
Sometimes they give you
what you need.

51:48.946 --> 51:51.884
And sweetie
you need drapes pronto.

51:51.914 --> 51:53.854
I don't need drapes!

51:53.884 --> 51:55.553
I need my life back!

51:55.583 --> 51:56.752
I just wished away my friends

51:56.782 --> 51:59.392
my Sweet 16 party
my senior prom...

52:01.262 --> 52:03.921
I missed graduation!

52:03.961 --> 52:05.690
I need to take that wish back!

52:05.730 --> 52:08.689
Oh sweetie.

52:08.729 --> 52:10.829
I'm afraid that's not possible.

52:10.859 --> 52:13.398
The candles and your
wishes go together.

52:13.428 --> 52:16.027
Since there's no do-over
wish on your list...

52:16.066 --> 52:19.566
I'm afraid when midnight
comes this is your life.

52:21.865 --> 52:22.864
But...

52:25.534 --> 52:27.133
Decorator's Delight.

52:27.173 --> 52:28.873
Uh-huh.

52:28.903 --> 52:30.272
On my way.

52:30.302 --> 52:31.373
Slipcover emergency.

52:31.403 --> 52:32.572
Gotta run.

52:32.602 --> 52:35.370
What? No no no!

52:35.410 --> 52:37.610
Wait!

52:37.640 --> 52:41.549
Celeste Celeste...

52:47.116 --> 52:48.486
You tryin' to run out
on the rent?

52:48.516 --> 52:50.086
No!
Good.

52:50.116 --> 52:51.786
First month is due
in three days.

52:51.816 --> 52:53.185
Pay up or move out.

52:57.024 --> 52:58.722
Move out.

53:01.622 --> 53:03.521
Move out.

53:11.029 --> 53:12.358
Stupid wishes!

53:12.398 --> 53:14.898
Why did I ever write you down!

53:21.706 --> 53:23.905
I'll just change one.

53:50.846 --> 53:52.016
Ha!

53:52.056 --> 53:53.515
Gotcha!

54:03.492 --> 54:06.061
I hate sushi and I always will!

54:13.798 --> 54:15.669
Hey...

54:16.968 --> 54:20.967
What about you
Wish No. 14?

54:21.007 --> 54:22.136
When I'm 16...

54:25.775 --> 54:27.744
There you are sweetheart.

54:27.775 --> 54:29.344
Mom don't you ever knock?

54:29.374 --> 54:30.544
I need privacy.

54:30.574 --> 54:31.573
What?

54:31.613 --> 54:33.971
I need privacy.

54:34.011 --> 54:35.112
Hold on a minute.

54:35.142 --> 54:37.041
Bob come here a minute.

54:37.071 --> 54:38.541
Tell your dad.

54:38.581 --> 54:40.380
I need privacy.

54:40.410 --> 54:41.510
One more time.

54:41.550 --> 54:43.009
I need privacy.
I need privacy.

54:43.049 --> 54:44.849
I don't understand a word
she's saying. Do you?

54:44.879 --> 54:46.948
No. Then again I never do.

54:54.316 --> 54:56.015
This has to work.

55:11.390 --> 55:13.190
Please understand.

55:25.196 --> 55:26.905
Abby!
Hi Daddy.

55:26.935 --> 55:29.104
Honey look who it is.

55:29.134 --> 55:31.204
Hello sweetheart.
Hi Mom.

55:31.234 --> 55:34.073
Shouldn't you be at your own
place unpacking those boxes?

55:34.103 --> 55:36.743
Yeah but I missed you guys.

55:36.773 --> 55:38.341
Aw that's sweet.

55:38.371 --> 55:40.071
But we're kind
of busy right now.

55:40.111 --> 55:41.480
Your turn dear.

55:41.510 --> 55:42.780
What's the use?

55:42.810 --> 55:45.610
22 cards in my hand
and I still can't play!

55:48.978 --> 55:49.848
Can't this wait?

55:49.878 --> 55:52.118
Of course it can.

55:52.148 --> 55:53.816
What's up?

55:56.585 --> 55:58.885
Well um...

56:00.155 --> 56:03.194
I have something
important to discuss with you

56:03.224 --> 56:10.861
and I thought if you really listen
to me you might understand.

56:13.700 --> 56:14.660
Bob.

56:14.700 --> 56:16.969
What? I'm listening.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.068
We're listening.

56:19.098 --> 56:20.398
Even if it sounds crazy?

56:20.438 --> 56:22.667
I listen to your father
all the time.

56:22.707 --> 56:23.667
What's that supposed to mean?

56:23.707 --> 56:25.236
Go on sweetheart.

56:29.275 --> 56:33.244
When I woke up this morning
I was 16 years old.

56:36.782 --> 56:39.742
I thought this was going to be
the best day of my life.

56:39.782 --> 56:45.680
Then this Birthday Fairy
appeared and gave me these.

56:48.549 --> 56:52.788
Would you look at this hon.

56:52.828 --> 56:55.487
Well that brings back
memories doesn't it?

56:55.527 --> 56:57.596
What?
What memories?

56:57.626 --> 57:00.295
Your father took me to the
Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant

57:00.325 --> 57:02.264
on the night you were born.

57:02.294 --> 57:04.094
I had the orange chicken.

57:04.134 --> 57:05.094
We thought it was an omen.

57:05.134 --> 57:07.134
We always felt so lucky

57:07.164 --> 57:10.302
to have a daughter as
wonderful as you are.

57:10.332 --> 57:11.431
Really?

57:11.471 --> 57:13.232
Really.

57:15.841 --> 57:20.308
Then you'll understand when
I say I need to come back

57:20.338 --> 57:22.509
and live with you
and go back to school..

57:22.539 --> 57:25.847
I'm not ready to have my own
apartment and my own job.

57:25.877 --> 57:27.846
Please tell me you understand.

57:27.876 --> 57:33.385
Abby look behind you.

57:33.415 --> 57:34.784
Ever since you were
a little girl

57:34.814 --> 57:38.953
all you wanted was to be
exactly what you are now.

57:38.983 --> 57:43.691
Beautiful and independent.

57:43.721 --> 57:45.990
I remember the day
this photo was taken.

57:46.030 --> 57:48.829
You wanted a grown-up
birthday party.

57:48.859 --> 57:53.068
All dressed up in my
high heels and pearls.

57:53.098 --> 57:54.599
You were never happier.

57:54.629 --> 57:59.436
But being grown up is different
than dreaming about it isn't it?

57:59.466 --> 58:02.136
Yes.

58:02.176 --> 58:04.034
We understand you.

58:04.074 --> 58:05.704
You do?

58:05.744 --> 58:07.144
Of course.

58:07.174 --> 58:08.744
You're scared your childhood
is over and with it

58:08.774 --> 58:11.972
all the best times of your life.
Yes!

58:12.012 --> 58:13.782
You probably want to just turn
back the clock and start over.

58:13.812 --> 58:14.842
Yes! Yes!

58:14.882 --> 58:16.281
That's exactly
what I want to do!

58:16.311 --> 58:19.579
We know how that feels.

58:19.619 --> 58:22.749
Then I'm still your
little girl?

58:22.779 --> 58:25.388
You'll always be our
little girl Pumpkin...

58:35.764 --> 58:37.424
Look! Wasps!

58:37.464 --> 58:38.363
Time to go Pumpkin.

58:38.393 --> 58:40.193
Drive safe.

58:40.233 --> 58:41.862
And don't forget these.

58:41.902 --> 58:44.331
But I thought you
guys understood.

58:44.361 --> 58:46.571
We do understand Adulthood
could be tough.

58:46.601 --> 58:48.430
Sometimes it gets
a little buggy.

58:48.470 --> 58:50.469
Bye now sweetheart!

58:52.670 --> 58:54.109
Love you!

58:59.346 --> 59:01.646
So that's what that feels like.

59:30.128 --> 59:31.227
Hi Logan.

59:31.267 --> 59:32.367
Hey.

59:32.397 --> 59:33.636
Cool ride.

59:33.666 --> 59:36.336
Yeah you said that
this morning.

59:36.366 --> 59:37.964
Huh?

59:38.004 --> 59:42.173
So...what are you
doing here?

59:42.203 --> 59:43.903
Party.

59:43.943 --> 59:45.741
Right.

59:47.712 --> 59:50.511
I wasn't invited.

59:50.541 --> 59:51.710
Huh.

59:57.178 --> 59:58.978
Hey!
Yeah?

59:59.018 --> 01:00:01.047
Will you do something for me?
Sure.

01:00:01.087 --> 01:00:03.886
Take a picture of me
with your car.

01:00:03.916 --> 01:00:06.325
Okay.

01:00:06.355 --> 01:00:07.625
Thanks.

01:00:07.655 --> 01:00:09.424
It's what I want
when I'm your age.

01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:14.822
There ya go.

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.263
Cool.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.700
Oh man that's hot.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.531
I can't wait to show Krista!

01:00:39.115 --> 01:00:40.515
Joey Lockhart!

01:00:43.354 --> 01:00:45.413
Get off of me!

01:00:45.453 --> 01:00:46.882
Get off!

01:00:46.922 --> 01:00:48.352
You have to believe me Jay.

01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:49.721
You're my best friend and
it's my 16th birthday

01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:51.821
and I got these magic
candles at the bus stop

01:00:51.851 --> 01:00:54.250
and this big car pulled up
and Joey Lockhart got out

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:59.258
and kissed me... I don't know her.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.157
You were there!
You saw him!

01:01:01.187 --> 01:01:02.728
Let go.

01:01:02.758 --> 01:01:06.056
Not until you listen to me.
Give me five minutes.

01:01:10.064 --> 01:01:11.565
Four.

01:01:15.703 --> 01:01:17.733
Okay.

01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:20.071
I know this is hard to believe

01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:24.041
but we're best friends
and I can prove it.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.009
So?

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:30.238
Look at your key ring.

01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:54.091
"Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay."

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.000
You gave this to
me this morning.

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.228
For my 16th birthday.

01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:14.064
Abby.

01:02:14.104 --> 01:02:16.074
You remember?

01:02:16.104 --> 01:02:18.003
I think so.

01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:20.972
So you believe me?

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:23.141
Yeah.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:24.541
I do.

01:02:35.177 --> 01:02:36.547
He believes me!

01:02:36.577 --> 01:02:37.776
Whoa.

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:39.187
Volume.

01:02:43.614 --> 01:02:46.483
This doesn't change anything.

01:02:46.523 --> 01:02:51.392
And when midnight comes
I'm stuck like this forever.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.989
Here lemme see the list.

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:03.888
Here ya go.

01:03:03.928 --> 01:03:13.265
Okay you've used 1 2
7 8 9... Skip ahead.

01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:15.204
I can't believe
you wasted a wish on sushi.

01:03:15.234 --> 01:03:16.835
I was 8.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:19.304
I had a very
unsophisticated palate.

01:03:19.334 --> 01:03:20.902
Had?

01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:30.109
You're a great best friend Jay.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.609
I know.

01:03:33.649 --> 01:03:34.849
C'mon.

01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:38.048
Most of these are
kind of useless

01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:40.747
since you're already an adult.

01:03:40.787 --> 01:03:48.184
That leaves 15 and Logan
Buchanan... Yeah about that...

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:51.153
15 was always my favorite.

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:55.791
"When I'm 16 I'll have
the best party ever."

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:03.799
But you're not 16 anymore.

01:04:15.906 --> 01:04:17.634
Hey.

01:04:17.674 --> 01:04:21.373
I kinda have to make an
appearance at Krista's party.

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:24.942
Do you maybe want to come
with me?

01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:28.981
Not as my date or anything.

01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:30.351
No.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.149
Of course not.

01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:34.789
Well?

01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:41.157
I'd love to go with you Jay.

01:04:43.326 --> 01:04:45.126
Okay.

01:04:55.793 --> 01:04:58.061
Sync by Hana.Bean
www.Addic7ed.Com

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.530
Great party.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.598
Ladies first.

01:05:17.166 --> 01:05:19.605
Mike?

01:05:19.635 --> 01:05:21.704
Give a shout-out to my
big sis Abby everybody.

01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:27.902
You're super old Abs
but you're still cool!

01:05:27.942 --> 01:05:29.841
So Mike can really play?

01:05:29.871 --> 01:05:31.041
Yeah.

01:05:31.071 --> 01:05:32.700
Something just clicked
with him this year.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.641
He got serious about
playing guitar.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.839
He's getting paid really
well for this gig.

01:05:42.478 --> 01:05:43.407
Wait.

01:05:43.437 --> 01:05:44.606
Did I miss something?

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:46.805
I mean besides senior year?

01:05:46.835 --> 01:05:49.404
Jay you're here!

01:05:49.444 --> 01:05:52.044
Hi! I'm so glad
you could make it!

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.604
Yeah.

01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:56.543
I'm...Abby Jensen.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:57.843
I know silly.

01:05:57.883 --> 01:05:59.842
We're neighbors?

01:05:59.882 --> 01:06:02.751
Yes.
Neighbors.

01:06:02.781 --> 01:06:04.280
Your party looks awesome.

01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:06.280
Thanks to your parents.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.378
They found all these amazing
decorations in their garage

01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:10.548
after their house
was infested by wasps.

01:06:10.588 --> 01:06:13.617
I guess they were left over
from your Sweet 16 Party

01:06:13.657 --> 01:06:15.586
but never got used
for some reason.

01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:17.696
So they just gave them to me!

01:06:17.726 --> 01:06:18.795
Lucky you.

01:06:18.825 --> 01:06:20.895
I know right?

01:06:20.925 --> 01:06:24.193
And you're just in time
for the big celebration.

01:06:26.763 --> 01:06:27.902
Thanks for coming everybody!

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.510
Man this is a dream
come true for me.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.340
What's happening?

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.479
Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:38.509 --> 01:06:40.708
Our new Student Body President!

01:06:46.117 --> 01:06:47.646
Thank you.

01:06:47.686 --> 01:06:50.046
I want to recognize my campaign
manager Krista Cook.

01:06:53.914 --> 01:06:55.684
What all of you don't know is
that I really wanted this

01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:58.353
but I was too afraid to try.

01:06:58.393 --> 01:06:59.892
I couldn't have done it
without your help Krista.

01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:04.621
Thank you so much!

01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:08.529
1 2 3 4...
Have fun okay? Mm-hmm.

01:07:14.767 --> 01:07:17.366
So you're Student Body
President?

01:07:17.396 --> 01:07:18.697
Yep.

01:07:18.737 --> 01:07:21.606
I was Student Body President.

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:22.965
Oh yeah.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.304
Weird.

01:07:24.334 --> 01:07:27.003
I thought with me out of the
way Krista would win for sure.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.602
Krista?

01:07:28.642 --> 01:07:31.002
She's hates competition.

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:32.101
Krista?

01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:33.341
Our Krista.

01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:34.441
Yeah.

01:07:34.471 --> 01:07:36.211
I think without you in her life

01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:39.310
she just didn't have a reason
to compete for anything.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.438
She's kind super helpful a good
listener and a great friend.

01:07:43.478 --> 01:07:45.648
You guys would like each other.

01:07:45.678 --> 01:07:48.517

Large pepperoni pineapple
for Jensen.

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:01.795
I didn't order a pizza.

01:12:01.825 --> 01:12:03.094
I know.

01:12:03.124 --> 01:12:05.864
I just thought
you could use a friend.

01:12:08.993 --> 01:12:10.332
Oh sweetie.

01:12:13.631 --> 01:12:15.331
Dry those tears.

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.430
I'm starving.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:19.869
You are?

01:12:19.899 --> 01:12:23.338
Sure us magical beings
have to eat too.

01:12:24.738 --> 01:12:26.637
This day didn't go
like I thought it would.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:28.337
I can't believe I wasted
my wishes on things

01:12:28.366 --> 01:12:29.706
like beating Krista Cook.

01:12:29.736 --> 01:12:31.235
Yeah.

01:12:31.275 --> 01:12:34.504
She's pretty nice now that she
is not out to destroy you.

01:12:34.545 --> 01:12:35.744
Don't rub it in.

01:12:35.774 --> 01:12:37.873
She's a really good friend
to Jay.

01:12:37.913 --> 01:12:39.544
Better than I was.

01:12:39.574 --> 01:12:42.143
I didn't even know he wanted
to be Student Body President.

01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:44.481
How could I have been
so thoughtless?

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.381
All I could think about

01:12:47.411 --> 01:12:52.219
was having parties and
clothes and popularity.

01:12:52.249 --> 01:12:55.477
I can't believe those things
were so important to me.

01:12:55.517 --> 01:12:57.148
You were 16.

01:12:57.188 --> 01:12:59.087
But I didn't appreciate it.

01:12:59.117 --> 01:13:01.786
Ever since I was little
I wanted to grow up.

01:13:01.816 --> 01:13:06.254
I thought it was the only way
to get what I wanted.

01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:09.653
I guess I didn't realize
what I already had.

01:13:21.599 --> 01:13:24.098
You still have
this little number.

01:13:29.837 --> 01:13:31.876
Wish 16.

01:13:31.906 --> 01:13:35.175
All those years I saved it
for something really special.

01:13:38.303 --> 01:13:40.144
Of all the wishes on this list

01:13:40.174 --> 01:13:43.543
this is the one
I wish I could change.

01:13:57.088 --> 01:13:59.087
Wow that gum is still
really fresh.

01:14:13.923 --> 01:14:13.963
Maybe the rules
don't know about gum.

01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:18.331
There's only one way
to find out.

01:14:44.683 --> 01:14:49.081
I wish I could start
this whole day over again.

01:14:54.349 --> 01:14:55.519
Surprise!

01:14:59.857 --> 01:15:01.628
Happy Birthday Abby.

01:15:01.657 --> 01:15:02.687
Look.

01:15:02.727 --> 01:15:04.726
Your first 16th
birthday picture.

01:15:09.265 --> 01:15:11.834
This is a great picture!

01:15:11.864 --> 01:15:14.562
This is the best picture I've
ever seen in my entire life!

01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:16.263
Thank you thank you thank you!

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:18.172
You're welcome Pumpkin.

01:15:19.701 --> 01:15:21.871
Make a wish sweetheart?

01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:25.040
I wish for exactly this.

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:27.969
Everything is perfect.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.707
Wasps!

01:15:34.776 --> 01:15:35.776
Yeah.

01:15:38.175 --> 01:15:40.076
I saw one crawl up the AC vent.

01:15:40.116 --> 01:15:41.485
No not one. Thousands!

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:44.144
Nesting up there for 16 years!

01:15:44.183 --> 01:15:45.983
Sweetheart we know.

01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:47.683
No you don't know.
You can't possibly know

01:15:47.713 --> 01:15:49.282
that the house is going
to be totally infested

01:15:49.321 --> 01:15:50.851
and the wasps will
take over the cars

01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:53.021
and you and Dad'll have
to live in the driveway

01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:54.889
but then Joey Lockhart
will come and kiss me

01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:56.319
and I will get candles
and wishes

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.289
and some really
gorgeous clothes

01:15:58.329 --> 01:16:01.027
and everything will look
like it will be okay.

01:16:01.067 --> 01:16:02.397
But then I will make
a really stupid wish

01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:03.867
that I didn't mean to make

01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:06.206
and I will have to grow up and
live alone and miss my party

01:16:06.236 --> 01:16:07.766
and this will turn into
the worst 16th birthday

01:16:07.806 --> 01:16:09.405
in the history of
16th birthdays!

01:16:09.435 --> 01:16:12.145
You have to call
the exterminator now!

01:16:15.673 --> 01:16:17.113
Okey dokey.

01:16:17.143 --> 01:16:18.482
All done.

01:16:18.512 --> 01:16:21.412
Whoo that was some wasps' nest.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.551
Celeste?

01:16:22.581 --> 01:16:23.611
Hi Abby.

01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:24.880
You know her.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.720
Yeah we just met this morning.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.358
When Abby called me.
You're very lucky I showed up when I did.

01:16:31.388 --> 01:16:34.487
So the wasps are all gone.

01:16:34.527 --> 01:16:37.326
Like they never happened.

01:16:37.356 --> 01:16:39.556
Everything is going to be okay?

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.925
Better than okay.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.964
Wait.
What do I owe ya?

01:16:43.995 --> 01:16:46.163
Consider it a Sweet 16 gift.

01:16:46.203 --> 01:16:48.433
Happy Birthday Abby.

01:16:48.463 --> 01:16:49.703
Thank you.

01:16:49.733 --> 01:16:52.232
For everything.

01:16:57.410 --> 01:17:00.439
Go on down and start making that
special birthday breakfast

01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:01.609
you have planned for me Mom.

01:17:01.639 --> 01:17:03.038
I'll be right there.

01:17:28.559 --> 01:17:32.299
♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪

01:17:34.328 --> 01:17:37.566
♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪

01:17:37.596 --> 01:17:38.697
Hey!

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:39.836
This is for you.

01:17:39.866 --> 01:17:41.736
I was saving it
for my Sweet 16 party

01:17:41.766 --> 01:17:45.105
but I think you need it more.

01:17:45.135 --> 01:17:46.034
Whoa!

01:17:46.074 --> 01:17:48.344
For what?

01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:49.773
A real guitar.

01:17:49.813 --> 01:17:52.442
I think you're really talented.

01:17:56.812 --> 01:17:58.280
Thank you Abs.

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:00.979
I love you Mike.

01:18:04.188 --> 01:18:06.587
Thanks for the yummy
breakfast Mom and Dad.

01:18:06.617 --> 01:18:08.916
Love you!

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:13.925
Love you too.

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:16.524
Krista! Krista! Wait!

01:18:16.564 --> 01:18:17.465
Get back.

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:18.923
We need to talk.

01:18:18.963 --> 01:18:21.632
I have nothing to say to you.

01:18:21.662 --> 01:18:23.862
I have one quick question.

01:18:23.902 --> 01:18:26.271
No you cannot have a ride.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.171
I don't want a ride.

01:18:28.201 --> 01:18:30.940
I want to understand.

01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:32.938
What did I ever do to you?

01:18:32.968 --> 01:18:34.709
Go away.

01:18:34.739 --> 01:18:36.008
No.

01:18:36.038 --> 01:18:38.977
Not until you answer me.

01:18:39.007 --> 01:18:40.648
Why don't you like me?

01:18:43.546 --> 01:18:45.646
You really don't know do you?

01:18:45.676 --> 01:18:48.644
Not a clue.

01:18:55.282 --> 01:18:57.751
It was in third grade.

01:18:57.791 --> 01:19:00.490
Jay and I were best friends.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.058
Then you moved to town.

01:19:04.088 --> 01:19:06.988
It was my birthday.

01:19:07.028 --> 01:19:09.798
Jay and I made a pact...

01:19:13.095 --> 01:19:15.965
Cheese!

01:19:15.995 --> 01:19:17.195
Best friends forever!

01:19:17.235 --> 01:19:19.064
Yeah!

01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:30.101
I stole your best friend.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:33.110
On my birthday.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.508
After that Jay and I
did everything together.

01:19:36.548 --> 01:19:38.379
Without me.

01:19:38.409 --> 01:19:40.808
That must have been
so horrible for you.

01:19:40.848 --> 01:19:42.876
It was.

01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:45.145
I can't imagine how you felt.

01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:47.316
How I felt?

01:19:47.356 --> 01:19:51.224
I felt like a loser.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:56.951
Krista if I could turn back
the clock and change that day

01:19:56.991 --> 01:19:58.662
I would.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.660
I am so sorry.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.699
You are?

01:20:09.468 --> 01:20:11.697
Any chance you can forgive me?

01:20:13.037 --> 01:20:14.866
I don't know.

01:20:14.906 --> 01:20:17.335
I made my own vow that day.

01:20:17.365 --> 01:20:21.874
Which was...
I vowed to win at everything

01:20:21.904 --> 01:20:26.073
so you'd never get anything
you wanted ever again.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:28.981
Wow.

01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:31.082
You did a great job.

01:20:31.112 --> 01:20:33.581
Thank you.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.888
Hey imagine if you used your
powers for good instead of evil.

01:20:40.918 --> 01:20:43.116
Like what?

01:20:43.156 --> 01:20:46.456
Do you really want to be
Student Body President?

01:20:46.486 --> 01:20:48.086
Honestly?

01:20:48.126 --> 01:20:49.485
No.

01:20:49.524 --> 01:20:53.824
It's exhausting having
to win all the time.

01:20:53.864 --> 01:20:58.232
If you want to drop out

01:20:58.262 --> 01:21:02.731
I know somebody who would
love to take your place.

01:21:04.701 --> 01:21:06.131
Hey Krista.

01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:09.298
Hey Abby!

01:21:09.338 --> 01:21:11.468
Boys.

01:21:11.508 --> 01:21:12.707
Cool ride!

01:21:12.737 --> 01:21:14.407
Thanks!

01:21:16.177 --> 01:21:17.377
Weird.

01:21:21.645 --> 01:21:23.384
You're a terrible best friend.

01:21:23.414 --> 01:21:25.014
No I'm not.
Yes you are.

01:21:25.044 --> 01:21:27.483
I had to take the bus by myself.
Where were you?

01:21:29.053 --> 01:21:30.921
I got a ride.

01:21:31.952 --> 01:21:33.891
You two.
In one vehicle.

01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:35.490
And it didn't like explode?

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.690
Nope.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.789
We have a surprise for you.

01:21:38.819 --> 01:21:39.959
Why? It's not my birthday.

01:21:39.989 --> 01:21:42.358
No it's mine...
And mine...

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:46.367
And all we want is for
your dream to come true.

01:21:46.397 --> 01:21:47.826
What dream?

01:21:49.897 --> 01:21:53.364
You're now the only person running
for Student Body President.

01:21:53.404 --> 01:21:55.833
So you'll win for sure.

01:21:57.574 --> 01:21:58.533
Think so?

01:21:58.573 --> 01:22:00.572
Absolutely.

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:06.781
Jay Kepler
ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:09.749
Our new...
Student Body President!

01:22:12.248 --> 01:22:13.818
Go Jay!

01:22:13.848 --> 01:22:16.347
Thanks everybody.

01:22:16.387 --> 01:22:18.087
Let's hear it for the hosts
of this little party

01:22:18.117 --> 01:22:19.815
Abby and Krista!

01:22:24.425 --> 01:22:26.984
Happy Sweet 16
to the both of you

01:22:32.862 --> 01:22:37.430

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:43.638
Look who's here.
Huh?

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:44.738
Look!

01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:51.476
Logan Buchanan
he's so gorgeous!

01:22:51.506 --> 01:22:53.535
You really like him don't you?

01:22:53.575 --> 01:22:54.774
Yeah.

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:57.043
I thought you liked him
to make me suffer.

01:22:57.073 --> 01:23:00.912
Making you suffer was a bonus but
I would have liked him anyway.

01:23:02.342 --> 01:23:06.511
Well I happen to know
he really likes you too.

01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:10.380
Really?
Really.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.189
Go talk to him.

01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:13.689
About what?

01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:18.627
Ask him about the red sports
car he wants to drive someday.

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:25.795
Okay.

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:30.404
Hi Logan.

01:23:30.434 --> 01:23:32.633
Thanks a lot for coming.

01:23:32.673 --> 01:23:34.073
You look great.

01:23:34.103 --> 01:23:35.502
You too.

01:23:57.155 --> 01:23:58.714
Happy Birthday Abby.
