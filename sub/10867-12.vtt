00:33.158 --> 00:34.953
I love masks!

00:34.953 --> 00:38.748
Put one on and it
changes who you are.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.459
You can be goofy...

00:41.459 --> 00:43.711
You don't need a mask for that.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.463
Or...

00:45.463 --> 00:46.631
glamorous.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.715
Dreaming!

00:47.715 --> 00:48.800
Or...

00:48.800 --> 00:51.970
mysterious.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.054
Got any masks
that'll make you taller?

00:54.054 --> 00:58.768
No, but I got one
that'll make you sick!

01:03.689 --> 01:06.108
I like those clear masks
that change your face just

01:06.108 --> 01:07.234
a little bit.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.611
WAY creepy.

01:08.611 --> 01:11.572
The thing about masks is
that they let you be

01:11.572 --> 01:13.115
whatever you want to be.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.535
Underneath you're still
you, but nobody can tell,

01:16.535 --> 01:19.580
cuz they can't see
what's behind the mask.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.834
My story's about the horror of
losing what's behind the mask.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.543
Huh?

01:24.543 --> 01:26.712
Behind every mask is the one
thing that makes you different

01:26.712 --> 01:28.589
from everybody else...

01:28.589 --> 01:30.716
your personality.

01:30.716 --> 01:34.762
But if you lost it, no
one would know you...

01:34.762 --> 01:36.973
no one would care.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.808
You'd be all alone...

01:38.808 --> 01:40.488
and forgotten.

01:43.938 --> 01:47.525
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

01:47.525 --> 01:50.820
I call this story...

01:57.326 --> 02:00.245
Emma darling, it's
a cold fall day,

02:00.245 --> 02:03.248
but your sweater
keeps you so very warm.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.588
No. No no no.

02:09.588 --> 02:14.886
Pretend it's your birthday.
You're excited.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.058
This will not do.

02:20.058 --> 02:21.684
Next girl please.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.061
But I could...

02:23.061 --> 02:27.189
No no. Next girl
please. Come on, go, faster.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.984
Cold day, hot sweater, right?

02:29.984 --> 02:30.984
Oui.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.198
Nice.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.910
Lovely.

02:42.204 --> 02:46.084
Little bit more!
Wind in your hair!

02:46.084 --> 02:49.420
Turn, spin!

02:54.425 --> 02:55.265
Enough!

02:57.302 --> 03:01.015
I have made my decision.

03:01.015 --> 03:04.060
I have found our
Spree sweater girl!

03:04.060 --> 03:11.109
Jessie? Yes, yes, you like?
Yes it is perfect.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.408
You okay?

03:19.408 --> 03:20.868
Sure.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.995
Congratulations.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.538
You'll get the next one.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.915
With THIS face?

03:25.915 --> 03:27.083
Not likely.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.167
Don't say that!

03:28.167 --> 03:29.460
You're beautiful!

03:29.460 --> 03:31.420
Yeah right. Since
when is thin lips

03:31.420 --> 03:33.131
and a big nose is beautiful?

03:33.131 --> 03:36.092
But you ARE beautiful.

03:36.092 --> 03:39.678
You have the cheekbones
of a Russian princess

03:39.678 --> 03:43.141
and the eyes of an
Egyptian queen.

03:43.141 --> 03:45.810
Have you thought about
performing in the theater?

03:45.810 --> 03:47.311
Thought about it?

03:47.311 --> 03:49.981
I dream about the theater.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.607
Who are you?

03:51.607 --> 03:55.653
A talent scout for the
Madame Visage Theater Company.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.655
Go to that address.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.198
See if you like it.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.699
Are you serious?

04:00.699 --> 04:01.949
Very.

04:04.996 --> 04:07.873
Good luck.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.919
That was...
weird.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.671
You gonna go?

04:13.671 --> 04:15.173
I don't know.

04:15.173 --> 04:18.550
What have I got to lose?

04:42.616 --> 04:43.566
Hello?
Anybody here?

04:56.172 --> 04:58.090
Excuse me?

05:00.718 --> 05:01.798
Hey!
Wait!

05:06.140 --> 05:08.184
What do you want?

05:08.184 --> 05:11.603
Uh, I'm here to
see Madame Visage.

05:11.603 --> 05:15.399
Someone gave me this...

05:21.947 --> 05:23.199
What's with the...?

05:23.199 --> 05:25.325
We're rehearsing a play.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.075
Oh.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.295
Madame will be with you shortly.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.135
Thanks.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.403
Are you a student of theater?

06:01.403 --> 06:04.073
Sort of.
I got this...

06:04.073 --> 06:04.793
Shhhh.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.828
You are stunning indeed.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.623
Come sit.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.460
Turn to the left please.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.502
Yes.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.670
Very nice.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.713
What?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.924
Look out, as if to the ocean.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.093
It's a lonely misty day.

06:24.093 --> 06:27.554
You're sad.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.266
Lovely, Emma.
Just lovely.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.017
How did you know my...?

06:32.017 --> 06:35.229
Your face would be perfect for
the lead role in my new play.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.481
The lead?

06:37.481 --> 06:38.690
For real?!

06:38.690 --> 06:41.235
But only after the
right preparation.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.402
Are you willing?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.822
Of course.
What do I have to do?

06:44.822 --> 06:47.908
My theater is known the world
over for presenting the most

06:47.908 --> 06:51.120
lovely faces to grace the stage.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.624
But raw beauty is just a start.

06:55.624 --> 07:00.963
This powder was
developed over 300 years ago.

07:00.963 --> 07:05.592
It conditions the skin and gives
it the most amazing properties.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.219
Is this what you use?

07:07.219 --> 07:09.721
Your skin is beautiful.
It almost... glows.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.224
Ahhh, GLOW is the right word.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.310
When your skin is
prepared with this powder,

07:14.310 --> 07:18.730
stage lighting is
almost unnecessary.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.810
Try some.

07:33.745 --> 07:38.458
I can see the change already.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.298
Really?

07:43.339 --> 07:46.758
Apply the powder frequently,
then come back tomorrow and we

07:46.758 --> 07:50.137
shall begin our adventure.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.430
Alright?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.848
Great!
Thank you!

07:52.848 --> 07:55.475
I can't wait!

07:57.602 --> 08:00.231
We're waiting.

08:00.231 --> 08:03.025
Where is she?

08:08.530 --> 08:12.368
Bring me the punishment book.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.339
No.
No!

08:19.708 --> 08:20.708
Brilliant.
Wonderful.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.592
Remove the hat please.
No dawdling!

08:28.592 --> 08:30.010
Nice sweater.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.011
Thanks. So.
How'd it go at that theater?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.264
You're not gonna believe this.

08:33.264 --> 08:34.722
They want me for the lead...

08:34.722 --> 08:38.059
Jessie darling, we'll set up...

08:38.059 --> 08:38.780
Hello.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.147
Do you model?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.232
I auditioned for you yesterday.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.444
You did not.

08:46.444 --> 08:47.569
I did.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.987
She did.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.449
What was I thinking?

08:51.449 --> 08:52.169
May I?

08:54.326 --> 08:55.076
Ok.

09:03.461 --> 09:04.795
Give her a scarf.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.515
Hurry!

09:07.005 --> 09:08.840
Yes. Wonderful.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.843
Stare at me like I'm
a bon bon, a candy.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.305
You're hungry.

09:14.305 --> 09:15.597
Yes yes, love it.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.641
How I missed it, I do not know.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.352
I am an imbecile!

09:20.352 --> 09:23.522
You are so beautiful, I love
your smile, yes, perfect!

09:23.522 --> 09:26.525
Way to go, Emma!

09:28.444 --> 09:30.904
I have decided.

09:32.448 --> 09:35.909
You must be the
next Spree cover girl.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.077
Cover girl?!

09:37.077 --> 09:38.077
Oui!

09:39.371 --> 09:43.750
You will be on the cover of one
million catalogues wearing the

09:43.750 --> 09:47.338
brand new line of
Spree clothing.

09:57.973 --> 10:01.018
Jacques's a
flake, but he's right.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.478
You look different.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.438
Did you take some
kind of magic potion?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.231
Well, sort of.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.941
I got this from Madame Visage.

10:07.941 --> 10:12.321
She said it's got...
properties.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.072
Who's Madame Visage?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.449
From the theater.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.577
She wants me to be the
lead in her next play.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.330
Cool, huh?

10:24.916 --> 10:28.086
Anyway, off to the theater.

10:28.086 --> 10:28.836
Ta!

10:30.881 --> 10:31.631
Ta!

10:34.510 --> 10:37.304
And he told me I'm going
to be on the cover

10:37.304 --> 10:38.305
of a million catalogues.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.432
Tilt to the right please.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.975
Isn't that great?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.101
Hmm?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.978
Yes of course.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.232
To the left.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.776
Spectacular.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.489
She's ready.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.204
What's the play
they're rehearsing?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.330
Rehearsing?

11:03.330 --> 11:07.376
This is no rehearsal.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.587
What's this?

11:09.587 --> 11:12.172
These are my other faces.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.925
You mean, other
actresses you've worked with?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.676
You might say that.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.803
Maybe I'll be in there someday.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.266
Sooner than you think.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.266
Hey!

11:32.734 --> 11:33.454
Ahhhh!

11:35.862 --> 11:38.323
No!
Get away from me!

11:38.323 --> 11:40.576
Get away!

11:42.786 --> 11:46.457
There.
Much better.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.247
Nooooo!!!

11:54.047 --> 11:58.843
No! My face!
You took my face!

11:58.843 --> 12:02.847
And a wonderful face it is!

12:05.350 --> 12:08.270
It's perfect for my new play.

12:08.270 --> 12:12.190
Welcome to my theater group.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.657
You'll be number 94.

12:19.657 --> 12:20.740
What?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.367
Names aren't allowed.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.952
I'm 87.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.704
But my face...?

12:25.704 --> 12:28.624
Madame Visage has it now.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.626
It's better this way.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.706
Trust me.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.098
Hello? Hello?

12:51.980 --> 12:54.858
Anybody here?

12:56.901 --> 13:00.405
Hello? Anybody here?

13:00.405 --> 13:04.075
Emma?
Oh, Emma.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.243
Don't be mad, please!

13:05.243 --> 13:06.953
Why would I be mad?

13:06.953 --> 13:10.248
Well, after what happened to
you I sorta followed you here

13:10.248 --> 13:14.294
so I could meet this...
Madame Visage.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.629
I'm not mad.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.422
Cool.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.174
What's with the feathers?

13:19.174 --> 13:21.301
We're rehearsing.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.053
So?
Could you introduce me?

13:23.053 --> 13:27.182
Of course.
Follow me.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.106
She took their faces?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.066
Why?
How?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.028
Madame's power is ancient.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.573
The faces keep her young.

13:42.573 --> 13:45.867
Everyone, this is 94.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.330
But she doesn't steal
faces just to stay young.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.207
She wants them for her plays.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.125
This is where we
make her costumes.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.044
Why doesn't someone stop her?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.629
Madame is too powerful.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.090
If you displease
her, she'll expel you.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.467
And you'd have to live outside.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.052
That can't be worse than here.

14:04.052 --> 14:04.802
No?

14:05.429 --> 14:08.139
Go outside and see
how people look at you.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.641
This is horrible.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.477
There is one
thing more horrible.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.687
The punishment book.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.981
Punishment book?

14:16.981 --> 14:20.277
Working here is a joy compared
to being banished there.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.362
If you are sent to
the punishment book,

14:22.362 --> 14:25.783
you'll never be seen again.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.869
Wait in here.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.332
Could I use some of that powder?

14:34.332 --> 14:35.542
Of course.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.754
As much as you'd like.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.928
What did you look like?

14:46.928 --> 14:48.722
I'd rather not talk about it.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.931
But you have to!

14:49.931 --> 14:51.475
It was you!

14:51.475 --> 14:55.186
What color were your eyes?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.187
Blue.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.939
I bet you had a nice smile.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.659
I did.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.944
I could show you if you want.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.279
How?

15:04.279 --> 15:05.905
It's in the book
with all the others.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.532
But if Madame catches us...

15:07.532 --> 15:10.494
I want to know
what you look like.

15:11.035 --> 15:11.755
C'mon.

15:26.426 --> 15:31.264
Emma?
The door's locked!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.693
That's me.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.444
What's your name?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.904
We are forbidden to use names.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.238
I don't care.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.241
My name is Emma.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.077
I'm...
I'm Lizzie.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.915
I haven't said
that in a long time.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.793
The hardest thing is
that no one can tell you apart

15:59.793 --> 16:01.712
from anyone else.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.005
But it gets worse.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.257
No one can see how you feel.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.678
If you're angry or sad or happy.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.221
It's like you're not there.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.182
Pretty soon, you just
stop feeling altogether.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.810
I don't want to stop feeling.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.270
I want to get out of here.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.314
What's in there?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.357
Nothing.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.777
We should go.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.278
Why is it locked?

16:27.278 --> 16:28.822
What are you doing?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.073
I was just showing...

16:30.073 --> 16:31.742
It's forbidden to
touch the book.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.117
I'm sorry.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.536
I'll never do it
again, I promise.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.079
Leave Lizzie alone.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.623
We don't use names here!

16:38.623 --> 16:40.083
I'm taking you to Madame.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.002
No! I'll be good. I promise.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.838
Back off 94!

16:44.838 --> 16:46.548
I'm not 94.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.759
I'm Emma.

16:48.759 --> 16:52.053
And I'm going to see
what's in that cabinet.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.225
You'll both be
punished for this!

17:03.314 --> 17:04.691
You locked me in!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.025
Sorry.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.402
Are you using the powder?

17:07.402 --> 17:08.252
Yes!
It's amazing!

17:11.990 --> 17:13.532
This won't take long at all.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.702
Madame!

17:15.702 --> 17:18.121
You'd better come... now!

17:18.121 --> 17:19.830
Well, SHE'S creepy...

17:19.830 --> 17:21.374
why did she call you Madame?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.209
Part of the play.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.210
Wait here...

17:24.210 --> 17:26.838
use more of the powder.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.638
Don't!
It's the punishment book!

17:38.308 --> 17:41.269
This is horrible!

17:42.771 --> 17:44.815
What's this?

17:44.815 --> 17:48.359
I've never seen it before.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.862
Who is THIS??

17:50.862 --> 17:53.364
They're here! They're in
the inner sanctum!

17:53.364 --> 17:54.491
Hurry, Emma, I'm scared.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.117
Is there another
way out of here?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.535
Yes but...
they'll get us!

17:57.535 --> 17:59.203
Show me!

18:01.832 --> 18:03.500
Stop right there!

18:03.500 --> 18:04.960
I've got an idea.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.419
Where's that costume room?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.255
Down here.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.011
There's nowhere to run.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.220
I'm not going to run.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.431
That's very wise.
Give me the book,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.851
or your punishment
will be more severe

18:20.851 --> 18:23.603
than you can imagine.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.527
You can't steal people's faces.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.904
I've been doing
it for centuries.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.823
All those lives are mine.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.992
They're not! You
have our faces,

18:36.992 --> 18:38.451
you can't take away who we are.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.495
But your face IS who you are.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.788
No it's not...

18:41.788 --> 18:44.499
and I'm going to
stop you right here!

18:45.750 --> 18:46.500
No!

18:55.719 --> 18:59.723
You think my power can
be destroyed that easily?

18:59.723 --> 19:02.934
You've been watching
too much television.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.729
Take them to my chamber.

19:09.524 --> 19:14.988
Now... the question is,

19:14.988 --> 19:19.910
what would be a
fitting punishment?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.790
This is getting weird
Emma, I want to leave.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.502
That's not me Jessie.

19:31.004 --> 19:35.050
Okay, now I
really want to leave.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.011
Bring me the punishment book.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.846
Let this be a lesson.

19:39.846 --> 19:46.686
94 and 87 broke my rules, and
they will be banished forever!

19:46.686 --> 19:48.105
Stop!

19:48.105 --> 19:49.606
I'm not 94!

19:49.606 --> 19:50.899
My name is Emma.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.110
And her name is Lizzie!

19:53.110 --> 19:54.402
You all have names.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.988
You have lives and
family and friends.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.240
Try to remember.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.451
What's your name?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.911
What about you?

20:02.911 --> 20:06.831
What's your name?
Rachel? Linda? Robin?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.792
Listen to me!

20:08.792 --> 20:10.919
She took your faces!

20:10.919 --> 20:12.087
She didn't take you!

20:12.087 --> 20:14.131
You're all still in there.

20:14.131 --> 20:17.216
You don't have to be this way!

20:27.685 --> 20:29.687
My name is Lizzie.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.983
I have a brother named
Bill, and a dog named Maggie.

20:32.983 --> 20:33.984
Silence!

20:33.984 --> 20:35.610
My name's Kayla.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.903
Good!

20:36.903 --> 20:38.155
Who are you?

20:38.155 --> 20:39.656
I'm Hilary...

20:39.656 --> 20:41.240
I miss my parents.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.786
Quiet!
No one is to speak again.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.789
Bring me the punishment book!

20:51.501 --> 20:54.171
You will not defy me!

20:55.213 --> 20:57.924
I own you all!

21:00.635 --> 21:02.887
[scream]

21:06.224 --> 21:08.810
Ok, now this is getting bad.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.522
Now,
trouble-maker, it's YOUR turn.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.440
The faces are mine...

21:14.440 --> 21:18.444
the girl's are mine, and no one
is going to take them from me.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.694
Stop!

21:20.947 --> 21:22.699
My name is Lorette.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.408
And you don't own me.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.036
How dare you!

21:26.036 --> 21:27.495
Listen to me!

21:27.495 --> 21:29.330
You'll all be punished!

21:29.330 --> 21:30.410
Take her!

21:33.835 --> 21:36.504
Do as I say!
I own you!

21:36.504 --> 21:38.589
I own you all.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.842
What should we do?

21:40.842 --> 21:43.887
I think it's time we gave
Madame Visage her own face back.

21:43.887 --> 21:44.637
NO!

21:45.680 --> 21:46.931
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

21:46.931 --> 21:48.558
IT'S NOT MINE ANY MORE!

21:48.558 --> 21:50.351
IT'S 300 YEARS OLD!!!

21:50.351 --> 21:51.551
Ahhhhhhhh!

22:40.735 --> 22:42.070
I know you.

22:42.070 --> 22:45.031
Madame used my face
to lure you here...

22:45.031 --> 22:46.950
I'm sorry.

22:46.950 --> 22:47.951
Emma?

22:47.951 --> 22:49.994
Lizzie?

22:52.163 --> 22:53.581
We're back.

22:53.581 --> 22:59.170
No, it's like you said.
We were always here.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.932
So it doesn't matter
what mask you wear,

23:10.932 --> 23:15.312
beneath it, you're still you,
and nobody can take that away.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.740
I said...
the end.

23:32.287 --> 23:35.373
Okay, now you're
creeping me out.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.877
Guys...

23:39.877 --> 23:41.838
Guys, stop!

23:41.838 --> 23:44.341
Good story!

23:44.341 --> 23:47.218
Very funny.
