WEBVTT

00:49.208 --> 00:51.082
Let's go! Let's go!

00:56.708 --> 00:58.165
Start her up! Start her up!

01:00.416 --> 01:02.040
Let's go! Let's go!

01:02.875 --> 01:05.874
- Cops! Go, go!
- Fuck!

01:06.041 --> 01:07.207
Let's go!

01:09.666 --> 01:10.790
God!

01:17.125 --> 01:18.749
Jesus fucking Christ!

02:40.333 --> 02:45.082
THE FURY OF A PATIENT MAN

03:14.666 --> 03:16.082
Afternoon.
What can I get you?

03:16.250 --> 03:18.249
I'll get it.
You call the beer people.

03:18.416 --> 03:20.790
You haven't called them yet?

03:20.958 --> 03:21.790
What'll it be?

03:21.958 --> 03:24.207
White coffee, please.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.999
- Something wrong?
- No.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.665
- Afternoon.
- What's up. Charo?

04:03.833 --> 04:05.874
I left you a tray,
it's meatballs today.

04:06.041 --> 04:08.124
- No, thanks, I had a bite.
- Everything alright?

04:08.291 --> 04:09.290
Yeah, fine.

04:28.458 --> 04:32.082
THE BAR

04:32.458 --> 04:35.040
Two high and one low,
three, plus two pair, five.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.207
Two of mine, seven bids...

04:37.375 --> 04:39.749
Come on, one left.

04:39.916 --> 04:42.374
If you put that low again
I'm outta here, man!

04:42.541 --> 04:44.540
You're obsessed!
All the time!

04:44.708 --> 04:46.707
- It's my hand. What can I do?
- Shut up.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.665
- Can I take this?
- A short coffee.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.874
- High and low, no looking.
- You've already had three.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.082
Never mind, they're paying.

04:53.416 --> 04:56.082
- Any pork scratchings left?
- Pork scratchings now?

04:56.250 --> 04:57.790
- José?
- No, thanks.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.707
Come on, pairs.

05:00.958 --> 05:01.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.582
- No.
- Pass.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.665
All of them. Fuck it.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.832
- Hit me.
- Son of a bitch!

05:10.791 --> 05:13.040
Now who's bald?!

05:13.208 --> 05:14.624
What do you want me to do?

05:14.791 --> 05:16.457
Fucking nice! Whoah!

05:16.625 --> 05:19.499
If you're no good at it,
go back to your plumbing.

05:19.666 --> 05:21.999
- Your deal, fuck it!
- A fucking winning streak!

05:22.166 --> 05:23.790
You've got two pair now?
Don't shit me!

05:24.750 --> 05:28.540
José! What a thrashing
we gave them, eh?!

05:28.708 --> 05:31.749
Hi! I'm leaving you
Lucky Luke here.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.832
Wow! That's looks great!

05:35.000 --> 05:38.124
He wanted to dress like a cowboy
and I can't get it off him.

05:38.291 --> 05:41.040
Tell your dad what you asked me for.
What's up, José?

05:41.208 --> 05:44.040
- Hi, Pili.
- What's my girl want?

05:44.208 --> 05:45.957
- A miniskirt.
- A miniskirt?

05:46.125 --> 05:48.082
I'm buying a leash for you!

05:48.250 --> 05:50.915
C'mon, Daddy, I'm so cute.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.790
- Anything else, José?
- No, thanks.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.415
- Pass me my bag.
- Ok.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.374
That hairstyle suits you.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.457
Thanks.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.582
Here.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.790
Juanjo, the kids are staying.
Keep an eye on them.

06:20.958 --> 06:21.790
Let's go.

06:23.666 --> 06:26.207
- See you.
- See you, handsome.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.040
Your sister looks sad.

06:36.208 --> 06:39.665
She's got a temper,
she's real hard to put up with.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.499
What we talked about yesterday,
the statement and all that...

06:43.666 --> 06:45.874
Don't worry,
you'll have it Monday.

06:46.041 --> 06:48.124
Thanks a lot, José.
I owe you bigtime.

06:48.291 --> 06:50.832
You're taking a load off us,
my head's...

06:51.000 --> 06:53.124
- It got tricky, huh?
- What did?

06:53.291 --> 06:54.624
Your brother-in-law.

06:54.791 --> 06:57.957
If it's not next week,
it'll be the one after.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.165
What can we do? Nothing.

07:01.333 --> 07:01.999
Right.

07:02.166 --> 07:05.874
But my sister gets so nervous,
no one can handle her.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.749
It'll be out of the frying pan
and into the fire.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.582
You look like crap.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.624
<i>Hello.</i>

08:42.250 --> 08:46.249
<i>Can't you sleep either?</i>

08:54.125 --> 08:55.540
<i>I was finishing some stuff.</i>

08:59.625 --> 09:02.207
<i>At two in the morning?</i>

09:06.500 --> 09:09.457
<i>I've got no time.
There's not enough hours in the day.</i>

09:13.375 --> 09:17.582
<i>I see you never stop.
You always look wound up.</i>

09:21.958 --> 09:23.790
<i>Sure. I've got a lot on my plate.
But I don't like complaining.</i>

09:26.500 --> 09:28.957
<i>Get on with it,
that's what we all do.</i>

09:33.291 --> 09:36.040
<i>Not all of us.</i>

09:39.583 --> 09:42.874
THE FAMILY

09:53.791 --> 09:55.040
Afternoon.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.540
Hello.

09:56.708 --> 10:00.707
Your aunt left you a bag
with a bottle and things.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.457
She says she can never
get you on our cellphone.

10:03.625 --> 10:06.165
She's invited you
to dinner with them.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.915
Forgive me for meddling, José,

10:12.791 --> 10:15.874
but I know you, okay?
You should get out more,

10:17.375 --> 10:19.707
meet people, have fun,

10:20.833 --> 10:22.874
- be with the family...
- Thanks, Charo.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.790
Hey, José!

10:37.958 --> 10:41.457
I thought you weren't coming.
I said: "It's late, he's not coming".

10:41.625 --> 10:43.624
- I brought a bottle...
- You didn't need to!

10:43.791 --> 10:46.582
José, you fag! Lucky you've come
or I'd have stopped talking to you.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.749
- I got this for the girl.
- Really?

10:48.916 --> 10:50.624
I won't kiss you
because I'm married.

10:50.791 --> 10:53.124
But whatever you want,
I'm your man.

10:53.291 --> 10:56.040
- You want a drink? Women?
- He's a pain when he drinks.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.749
Come meet Pili's sister,
she just separated.

10:58.916 --> 11:01.915
She's as big as an ox,
but nice and warm...

11:02.083 --> 11:04.207
- Are you a moron, or what?
- But honey, is it true or not?

11:04.375 --> 11:07.499
- Stop goofing around.
- I love you when you get mad!

11:07.666 --> 11:11.374
You get all silly.
Get off me, you idiot!

11:23.666 --> 11:25.665
It's so hot.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.249
My bracelet's too big for me.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.207
It'll fit when you're older.

11:34.375 --> 11:37.082
Last year,
Rubén Gómez from 4B

11:37.250 --> 11:39.249
gave me a bracelet

11:39.416 --> 11:41.540
his ex gave back when they split up.

11:41.916 --> 11:44.207
- You've already got boyfriends?
- I did.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.415
But don't tell my dad,
he'll get mad.

11:54.333 --> 11:57.082
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.582
8 years in October.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.915
After my brother-in-law's thing,
my sister wanted to move away.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.582
And I met her here.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.165
I think it was fate,
I got her pregnant straight away.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.957
I've got Pili right here
in the palm of my hand.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.665
That woman's done so much for me.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.165
Sometimes I think:

12:47.333 --> 12:49.999
"Am I missing out on
stuff with my buddies

12:50.166 --> 12:52.832
and screwing up bigtime."
You know what I mean?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.540
But then I get home
from working like a bastard

12:55.708 --> 12:59.249
and my girl's waiting for me,
that's just the greatest.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.082
I wouldn't change that for anything.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.207
Your buddies are around,
they are what they are,

13:04.375 --> 13:08.082
but family?
Family is blood, José.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.249
That's the way it is.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.165
You're a great guy. Shit!
You're really great.

13:16.333 --> 13:20.082
Good evening and thanks for coming
to our daughter's communion.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.290
It's so exciting for us parents:

13:22.458 --> 13:24.582
her first communion.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.457
Wasn't she beautiful?
No, stunning!

13:26.625 --> 13:29.415
I don't care how much
the dress cost.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.499
I love you all,
but especially you, honey.

13:32.666 --> 13:33.957
Come on!

13:45.958 --> 13:48.207
Hey, José, having a good time?

13:48.375 --> 13:50.415
- Nice communion, huh?
- Yes.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.665
Isn't it nice?
And how about Anita?

13:53.583 --> 13:57.124
How does green suit her?
She looks pretty, huh?

13:57.291 --> 14:00.165
And your brother-in-law?
Juanjo said he's out in a week.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.790
Him? Do you want to ruin
the communion for me?

14:02.958 --> 14:05.290
- Don't you get on with him?
- No opinion either way.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.749
I don't even know him.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.457
Everyone says he's a good guy.

14:10.625 --> 14:15.165
Eight years he's been in jail.
He can't be that good, right?

14:16.666 --> 14:20.124
I really love Anita, José.
I love her a lot.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.415
Inside or outside of jail

14:22.583 --> 14:24.374
he's been trouble for her.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.249
You look a bit tense too.

14:29.416 --> 14:32.124
Don't look at me like that, José,

14:32.291 --> 14:35.582
we're not 15 years old.
And out of sight...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.457
Hey, mum's the word.

14:38.833 --> 14:39.999
Come here.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.790
You listen to me.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.207
What's wrong? Jealous?

16:38.500 --> 16:39.915
You're so short!

16:51.458 --> 16:52.499
That's better.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.457
Where'd you come from?

17:52.416 --> 17:55.624
How come you hang around
my neighborhood so much?

17:55.791 --> 17:57.124
I like it.

17:57.291 --> 17:58.499
You like what?

17:58.666 --> 17:59.957
The neighborhood.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.624
Get outta here!

18:01.791 --> 18:04.165
You live in a fucking nice area

18:04.333 --> 18:06.249
in a house that's...

18:07.333 --> 18:10.082
The living room's bigger
than my whole place.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.040
How could you like this?

18:12.208 --> 18:13.832
I like it.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.415
You do?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.665
You're kind of weird.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.374
What else do you like?

18:25.250 --> 18:27.082
What do you do?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.249
I rent out two flats I inherited,

18:30.416 --> 18:33.999
a garage, a store.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.499
The house in the village,
I'll never sell that.

18:37.666 --> 18:40.957
Maybe Pili's got a point,

18:41.125 --> 18:42.957
you're a catch.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.915
Anyway, man,
if you've got any spare...

18:51.666 --> 18:54.957
The house in the village,
is it your parents'?

18:55.125 --> 18:56.165
It was.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.165
Is it nice?

18:58.083 --> 19:00.124
The usual, I never go anymore.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.082
And...

19:03.250 --> 19:06.540
what if I go with you
and fix up the place?

19:08.208 --> 19:10.082
We could both live there.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.124
I could take care of you.

19:14.416 --> 19:17.749
You could wake me up
in the morning with breakfast.

19:17.916 --> 19:20.040
And we could hang out
like this all day,

19:21.166 --> 19:22.749
doing nothing else.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.457
Well, you could take me out
to dinner sometimes.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.957
Or I could bring you dinner in bed.

19:33.708 --> 19:34.915
What?

19:36.291 --> 19:37.665
What about your boyfriend?

19:39.625 --> 19:40.749
And your girlfriend?

19:42.875 --> 19:44.332
I don't have one.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.540
How long have you been with him?

20:23.416 --> 20:24.915
Since I was 16.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.999
You've been alone a while, huh?

20:47.500 --> 20:48.915
What's the time?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.207
I'm sorry.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.915
I didn't want to bug you, sorry.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.665
I've been alone for 8 years,
since he went to jail.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.290
I got pregnant during a visit.

21:09.916 --> 21:10.957
I know.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.165
Juanjo told me.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.999
What did he tell you?

21:16.166 --> 21:19.082
He was the only one caught
in a jewelry store robbery.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.540
And that someone died.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.457
And he didn't know
who they were,

21:24.625 --> 21:27.415
they just hired him
to wait outside with the car.

21:29.916 --> 21:33.540
Curro's not a bad guy,
he just keeps bad company.

21:37.083 --> 21:38.124
Did you know them?

21:40.916 --> 21:42.915
If I did, he wouldn't be inside.

21:44.083 --> 21:47.332
Why did he do it?
Did you ever ask him?

21:49.666 --> 21:52.624
He never talked about his stuff
and I got used to not asking.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.332
Was he afraid
something might happen to him?

21:59.625 --> 22:01.582
He takes what he's dished out.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.999
Was he afraid
something might happen to you?

22:08.791 --> 22:10.540
I'm all he's got.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.040
He just wants me to be okay.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.749
Did they threaten him?

22:25.666 --> 22:26.832
Really,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.124
do you want to keep talking
about my boyfriend?

22:33.250 --> 22:35.332
I don't feel like it at all.

23:16.875 --> 23:18.082
Honey...

25:07.750 --> 25:09.540
- Wanna play with your cousin?
- Yes.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.624
Come on, come to Mom.

25:11.791 --> 25:13.040
Wait a second.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.707
Quique, Silvia's guy, told me

26:15.750 --> 26:19.415
there could be work in the garage.
I'll see him tomorrow.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.624
Eat up. And stop watching TV.
You want me to turn it off?

26:25.791 --> 26:28.457
I want to watch cartoons.

26:43.416 --> 26:44.624
Like it?

26:44.791 --> 26:45.957
Yeah.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.707
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.082
Nothing?

26:56.250 --> 26:57.707
I'm fine.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.249
Don't give me that "I'm fine" shit.
What the hell's wrong?

27:02.416 --> 27:05.665
Calm down, the boy's asleep.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.249
Calm down?

27:10.791 --> 27:11.957
Curro...

27:12.750 --> 27:14.957
- Fucking hell!
- Curro.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.749
Don't treat me like an asshole,
please don't.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.290
What's wrong?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.499
Do you love me?

27:31.666 --> 27:32.707
What?

27:34.083 --> 27:35.957
Do you love me?

27:36.125 --> 27:38.624
Of course I do, loads.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.165
Then why are you crying?

27:44.500 --> 27:46.207
It's weird.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.124
What is?

27:48.291 --> 27:51.540
You being here,
I'm used to being alone.

27:55.125 --> 27:57.290
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Curro...

27:57.458 --> 27:58.457
Curro, please, calm down.

27:58.708 --> 28:00.374
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Curro...

28:00.541 --> 28:02.082
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Stop shouting!

28:02.250 --> 28:05.040
- I will if I fucking feel like it!
- No, you're in my home!

28:05.208 --> 28:06.624
- Your home?
- What?

28:07.666 --> 28:09.790
What? Eh?

28:13.666 --> 28:15.124
Don't you touch me.

28:19.791 --> 28:21.624
After all I've done for you...

28:21.791 --> 28:24.707
I've tried to keep focused,
to be okay,

28:24.875 --> 28:27.374
to keep my head together...
After all I've done...!

28:27.541 --> 28:29.624
After all I've done for you...

28:36.291 --> 28:40.290
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

29:05.416 --> 29:08.624
- You, pairs.
- I got pairs.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.165
- Pass.
- Well...

29:10.333 --> 29:12.332
- What do I do?
- Call.

29:13.291 --> 29:13.957
Bid.

29:14.708 --> 29:15.540
Raise.

29:16.416 --> 29:17.415
Five more.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.499
Raise.

29:21.041 --> 29:23.374
- Make me happy.
- Unless I blow you under the table...

29:23.541 --> 29:25.332
- Right, what do I do?
- Play yours.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.707
- Mine.
- Sure.

29:27.375 --> 29:28.624
Then all in.

29:28.791 --> 29:29.707
All in?

29:29.875 --> 29:31.874
Relax, I got a "dandy" here.

29:32.041 --> 29:34.165
- Tell me what you got.
- "Dandy", he says...

29:35.958 --> 29:38.040
- I'll have to call.
- No, wait. What have you got?

29:38.208 --> 29:41.249
High it is. Kings.

29:41.416 --> 29:43.249
Fuck that bluff.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.415
I'm not bluffing.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.624
Fuck it, you bastards!

29:48.791 --> 29:50.499
Suck on that shit!

29:51.666 --> 29:53.499
Are you an asshole?

29:54.375 --> 29:56.749
Are you an asshole? You clown!

29:57.125 --> 30:00.499
Is this guy an asshole?
You think you're tough? Fuck me!

30:01.208 --> 30:03.790
- I'll punch your lights out!
- Hey, take it easy!

30:03.958 --> 30:05.457
Fucking hell!

30:05.625 --> 30:07.999
Don't you touch me!
Don't laugh at me!

30:08.166 --> 30:09.999
Shut your mouth
and get back there.

30:10.166 --> 30:13.082
Don't fucking touch me!
Get the fuck off me!

30:14.541 --> 30:16.082
Are you stupid, or what?

31:10.208 --> 31:13.290
<i>Are you there?</i>

31:19.750 --> 31:22.540
<i>I've got a proposition for you.</i>

33:30.333 --> 33:33.290
WRATH

34:20.083 --> 34:22.915
This isn't Ana. I want to talk to you.

34:24.166 --> 34:26.415
Can we meet up?

35:31.250 --> 35:32.665
What the hell's going on here?

35:33.500 --> 35:35.457
Why have you got Ana's phone?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.207
That man there is my father.

35:39.708 --> 35:41.374
And the woman they killed
was my girlfriend.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.540
Who were they?

35:52.083 --> 35:53.457
Tell me who they are.

35:55.208 --> 35:58.207
- I don't know anything.
- Yes you do.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.999
And you're going to tell me.

36:01.583 --> 36:03.832
You don't want anything
to happen to your family.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.207
Are you threatening me?

36:07.333 --> 36:08.915
You can't threaten me, motherfucker.

36:10.791 --> 36:11.832
God!

36:14.916 --> 36:16.332
Fuck you to hell and back!

36:17.541 --> 36:19.707
Where is she? Where?

36:30.791 --> 36:34.040
I'll call back. I'm with this man
and I can't hear you.

36:34.208 --> 36:37.582
Big kiss. Ciao.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.707
I've got nothing to lose now.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.124
And I'll do what it takes
to get you to tell me.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.540
I just want to know who they are.

36:59.666 --> 37:02.832
On the night shift a man
came in with his head split

37:03.000 --> 37:06.874
because some lads mugged him
for 20 euros.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.624
- Does it hurt?
- No.

37:10.250 --> 37:11.707
Be careful anyway.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.790
Wrist injuries can get complicated
if you don't look after them,

37:14.958 --> 37:17.582
so the less you move it, the better.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.332
This is in case
you want to report it.

37:21.625 --> 37:24.040
You can take these
every 8 hours for the pain.

37:24.208 --> 37:28.082
Come back in 2 days
if the swelling doesn't go down.

37:28.250 --> 37:29.332
Thank you.

37:34.791 --> 37:36.999
- The bathroom?
- Yes, first on the left.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.332
Pili, it's Curro.
Have you heard from Ana?

37:57.375 --> 37:58.832
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.040
No, listen to me.

38:00.458 --> 38:03.874
If she turns up
or anyone mentions her,

38:04.041 --> 38:05.624
call me, please.

38:05.791 --> 38:08.165
You got that? Call me.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.624
I gotta hang up, 'bye.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.749
I want to talk to Ana,
to know she's alright.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.749
They're alright.

38:22.916 --> 38:23.874
See you later.

38:24.041 --> 38:25.249
'Bye.

38:27.166 --> 38:30.040
Help me find them and make sure
nothing happens to me first.

38:37.458 --> 38:41.124
If anything happens to my wife
and son, I swear I'll kill you.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.582
Can you drive?

39:35.041 --> 39:37.040
<i>I haven't heard from them in years.</i>

39:37.208 --> 39:39.290
<i>They were from my neighborhood.</i>

39:39.458 --> 39:41.207
<i>I needed cash
and they offered me that.</i>

39:41.375 --> 39:42.582
<i>I just had to drive.</i>

39:44.708 --> 39:45.624
<i>The first year,</i>

39:45.791 --> 39:47.749
<i>one of them came to see me
in jail a few times.</i>

39:47.916 --> 39:51.040
<i>Apparently he was still
living round the way with his mom,</i>

39:51.208 --> 39:52.624
<i>but then I heard nothing from him.</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:55.540
<i>What's his name?</i>

39:55.708 --> 39:57.124
<i>Santi.</i>

39:57.291 --> 39:58.499
<i>But they call him "Juni".</i>

40:01.666 --> 40:03.124
<i>And the others?</i>

40:03.333 --> 40:04.582
<i>Julito and Rober.</i>

40:04.916 --> 40:07.624
<i>I knew Julito from playing football
when we were kids.</i>

40:12.125 --> 40:13.790
<i>Rober was an older guy.</i>

40:13.958 --> 40:16.332
<i>He'd been inside
a couple of times, I think.</i>

40:16.500 --> 40:18.957
<i>In theory,
he had the most experience.</i>

40:24.833 --> 40:26.457
<i>Talking will do no good.</i>

40:28.208 --> 40:29.749
<i>I don't want any trouble.</i>

40:29.916 --> 40:32.040
<i>Not with these people or anybody.</i>

40:34.500 --> 40:37.207
<i>You won't have any more trouble.
Just take me to them.</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:46.165
Excuse me, are you from round here?

40:46.333 --> 40:49.165
No, we're doin' a degree,
an Erasmus thing.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.124
Do you know "Santi"?
They call him "Juni".

40:51.291 --> 40:53.999
Juni... Santi... No fucking idea.

40:54.166 --> 40:56.790
- Where's the gym?
- Boxing gym? Back there.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.374
- Go look there.
- See you.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.082
Excuse me,
are you from round here?

41:05.125 --> 41:07.749
We're looking for Santi,
they call him "Juni".

41:07.916 --> 41:08.790
Santi what?

41:08.958 --> 41:11.249
- A guy from Seville.
- "El Triana"?

41:11.416 --> 41:13.124
I don't know what he's called now.
He's a buddy, a local.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.207
Short, bulging eyes,
talks like...?

41:16.375 --> 41:17.874
Andalusian.

41:18.041 --> 41:19.332
Jacin!

41:23.583 --> 41:26.832
Jacin!
What's El Triana's name?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.540
- What?
- Is he called Santi?

41:28.708 --> 41:29.999
- Who?
- El Triana?

41:30.166 --> 41:33.290
- Triana who?
- Give me shit and I'll fuck you up!

41:33.458 --> 41:35.582
You and whose army, fatass?

41:35.750 --> 41:38.999
Fucking hell!
Hey, what's Triana's name?

41:39.166 --> 41:41.207
- Triana? Santi.
- Is he around?

41:41.375 --> 41:43.040
I haven't seen him.
He'll be around.

41:43.208 --> 41:44.499
Got a light?

41:45.458 --> 41:47.290
Here comes the big shot.

41:47.458 --> 41:49.957
Triana, some guys are looking for you.

41:54.333 --> 41:57.749
Fuck me! Currito!

42:00.166 --> 42:03.499
Fucking hell, Currito!
It's great to see you!

42:04.541 --> 42:06.624
- How you doin'?
- Good, man.

42:07.083 --> 42:09.165
- When did you get out?
- Two days ago.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.374
You put on weight, huh?

42:11.541 --> 42:12.957
Hey, how'd you find me?

42:13.125 --> 42:15.790
- I went to see your mom.
- Shit. How is she?

42:16.500 --> 42:17.499
Old.

42:17.666 --> 42:19.165
You got style, motherfucker.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.874
This is José, a buddy. Santi.

42:22.041 --> 42:23.707
What's up?

42:24.458 --> 42:26.624
Are you buddies from...?

42:27.958 --> 42:29.165
From "the can" I mean.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.540
Are you mute, or what?

42:34.583 --> 42:35.874
Are you mute?

42:36.041 --> 42:37.957
Is he mute?

42:38.125 --> 42:40.540
- Is he mute?
- Yeah.

42:41.708 --> 42:43.415
Can you talk "mute"?

42:44.541 --> 42:46.665
- He's mute, not deaf.
- Fucking hell.

42:48.041 --> 42:50.499
Sorry, man, sorry.

42:50.666 --> 42:52.540
Let's get a beer.

42:52.708 --> 42:54.499
Come on,
I'm going to the storeroom.

42:54.666 --> 42:58.832
Quit staring, Jacinto,
you'll get all weird again.

42:59.250 --> 43:00.582
What's up, cutie?

43:01.833 --> 43:03.582
I spend my whole day here.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.915
His face looks worse than mine.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.749
- What's up, Triana?
- What's up, man?

43:11.791 --> 43:14.082
Mariano doesn't like you
taking people down there.

43:14.250 --> 43:16.790
They're not "people",
they're my friends.

43:18.666 --> 43:21.915
They say it smells like shit here
because it's blocked,

43:22.083 --> 43:24.540
but I lost my sense of smell.

43:26.208 --> 43:27.582
They're cool, they're buddies.

43:27.750 --> 43:29.999
- You got my candy?
- Here, candy.

43:30.166 --> 43:33.040
- No strawberry?
- I'll give you what you like later.

43:36.791 --> 43:39.124
Watch it, there's a dodgy step.

43:39.291 --> 43:41.999
The dwarf fell the other day,
almost killed himself.

43:42.166 --> 43:44.207
This looks like it.

43:45.208 --> 43:47.665
This is it.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.374
Make yourself at home.

43:49.541 --> 43:53.332
Just don't touch the computer,
I'm busy with something.

43:53.500 --> 43:57.165
Juani's sister put me onto
one of those jerk-off chat pages

43:57.458 --> 43:59.540
and they rob you blind
if you don't watch out.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.207
A beer here, another here...

44:03.375 --> 44:05.707
Take a seat here.

44:05.875 --> 44:06.749
Well,

44:07.958 --> 44:10.665
to Currito, to his freedom.

44:14.708 --> 44:16.832
It's great to see you.
How you doin?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.665
- Good, good.
- Well, well...

44:18.833 --> 44:21.499
You know I'm workin' in La Baraca?

44:21.666 --> 44:24.832
I'm workin', doin' this and that.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.582
They even got me on the web page,
check it out.

44:27.750 --> 44:29.790
You and I had some times
in La Baraca.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.874
In La Baraca and other joints.

44:33.916 --> 44:37.707
This guy and I used to
get shit-faced alright.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.665
You got a friend here
for whatever, you got me?

44:41.833 --> 44:44.874
What this man's done for me,
you wouldn't read about it.

44:45.041 --> 44:47.290
He's got a friend for whatever.

44:47.708 --> 44:49.999
You know it, or don't you?

44:50.166 --> 44:53.415
- Yeah, man.
- Not "yeah, man". Yeah, Curro!

44:53.583 --> 44:56.290
You got a friend in me,
whatever you want,

44:56.458 --> 44:59.540
I'm with you to the death.
Shit, yeah!

44:59.708 --> 45:03.207
I was too busy to see you
in "the can" more than once.

45:03.375 --> 45:05.999
I was real busy,
I was like all over the place,

45:06.166 --> 45:09.082
but I thought about you a lot
and whatever you want, you got it.

45:09.458 --> 45:10.707
Whatever you want.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.249
You don't have any "nose candy"
to celebrate?

45:14.416 --> 45:15.499
No.

45:15.666 --> 45:18.499
You look good, it's great
to see you. How's the family?

45:18.666 --> 45:20.499
Good, good. It's all fine.

45:20.666 --> 45:22.665
I heard you had a kid
while you were in "the can".

45:22.833 --> 45:26.040
- Yeah, he'll be taller than me.
- That wouldn't be hard.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.624
- Hey, listen up.
- Go ahead.

45:28.791 --> 45:30.540
You heard from Julito and the guys?

45:30.708 --> 45:32.374
That's what you wanted to know?

45:32.541 --> 45:34.915
You wanted to know about Julito.

45:35.083 --> 45:37.082
He went to live in the country,

45:37.250 --> 45:39.082
his dad's hometown, in Segovia.

45:39.250 --> 45:42.374
What's it called? "Lebrero"...

45:42.541 --> 45:44.290
- Lebreles.
- Lebreles, that's it!

45:44.458 --> 45:47.082
He's been there a while.
He just up and left.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.165
And Rober?

45:51.458 --> 45:52.874
Rober?

45:53.916 --> 45:55.582
Didn't you hear?

45:55.750 --> 45:58.499
Rober killed himself.
Didn't you hear?

45:58.666 --> 46:00.665
You didn't? I thought...

46:00.833 --> 46:03.290
Rober crashed his car and died.

46:03.458 --> 46:04.957
Just over a year ago.

46:05.125 --> 46:08.082
I tell you what: fuck him.

46:08.250 --> 46:11.374
He was a prick from when
he was born to when he died.

46:12.041 --> 46:14.624
Why am I telling you?
You know alright.

46:14.791 --> 46:17.874
Shit, look! I knew there was
a scrap left here.

46:18.041 --> 46:20.290
You don't want any, right?
Dope's more your thing.

46:20.458 --> 46:22.249
If you don't mind, I'll do it.

46:30.333 --> 46:33.415
You could tell Rober was going
to end up real bad.

46:33.583 --> 46:35.457
You don't know
what he did to me once.

46:35.625 --> 46:38.332
I was minding 4 kilos of blow
in my mom's house

46:38.500 --> 46:40.499
and he finds out
and comes round begging:

46:40.666 --> 46:43.499
"Gimme a few grams to sell,
we'll split it".

46:43.666 --> 46:46.790
I said no, no way.
Three days later, I'm on the street

46:46.958 --> 46:49.665
and three undercover cops turn up,
built like tanks.

46:49.833 --> 46:52.249
I acted casual,
but I was scared shitless.

46:52.416 --> 46:55.499
These guys go and I say:
"Hold on... it's Rober".

46:55.666 --> 46:58.540
So I call Rober and meet up
with him, like it's nothing.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.582
Acting casual, I tell him a joke

47:00.750 --> 47:03.624
and while he's laughing
that rat laugh of his,

47:03.791 --> 47:04.999
I get him, bam,

47:05.166 --> 47:08.332
a headbutt, broke his nose,
bleeding like a pig he was.

47:08.500 --> 47:10.207
I grab his balls tight

47:10.375 --> 47:13.082
and the guy bawls:
"I ain't done nothing".

47:13.250 --> 47:17.249
I tell him: "You're a pig
and I'm branding you like one!".

47:43.625 --> 47:46.124
No, no, no.

49:17.791 --> 49:18.874
There's no water.

49:26.333 --> 49:27.874
Go.

49:33.416 --> 49:35.249
Dry yourself off.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.749
- Where's Santi?
- Talking to his girlfriend.

49:51.916 --> 49:54.999
- "Girlfriend", he says.
- He's got no girlfriend.

49:55.166 --> 49:58.374
Probably jerking off
to your sister on the computer.

49:59.375 --> 50:01.207
Imagine Triana as your brother-in-law!

50:01.375 --> 50:03.915
Imagine Christmas Eve!

50:04.125 --> 50:05.832
Open the door for me.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.832
- Afternoon, Mariano.
- Get moving.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.207
- Who are they?
- Friends of Triana.

50:14.375 --> 50:17.207
- Who let 'em downstairs?
- I told them they couldn't.

50:17.375 --> 50:18.207
Santi.

50:18.375 --> 50:21.415
Fuck Santi, I'm the boss here.
Where'd you get that sweater?

50:21.583 --> 50:24.582
- From Santi.
- No gifts here, they cost a fortune.

50:24.750 --> 50:26.374
- Where the hell is Santi?
- Downstairs.

50:26.541 --> 50:27.499
Downstairs?

50:28.125 --> 50:32.124
Tell him to get the fuck up here!
You guys drive me fucking nuts!

50:35.041 --> 50:38.082
- Mariano, the guy in the sweater!
- Where are you going?

50:38.250 --> 50:40.749
You stay put!
The sweater's 20 bucks!

50:41.125 --> 50:42.540
Do I stutter?

50:42.708 --> 50:45.415
- Fuck!
- Get outta here.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.582
No fucking fighting here!

50:47.750 --> 50:50.665
- 20 bucks or take it off.
- We gave it to him.

50:50.833 --> 50:53.832
- Then get him up here.
- Here, count it.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.332
Get outta here!
And don't fucking come back!

51:46.666 --> 51:48.499
How could you do this to me?

51:49.416 --> 51:53.040
- How could you do this to me?
- Do what?

52:03.958 --> 52:05.582
What I did is my business.

52:05.750 --> 52:06.915
Your business?

52:07.500 --> 52:10.249
Fucking hell! Your business?

52:10.416 --> 52:12.707
I could've left you in there.

52:14.125 --> 52:15.665
I'll take care of it.

52:16.708 --> 52:18.374
I want to see my wife.

52:20.041 --> 52:21.832
I've done what I had to do.

52:22.958 --> 52:24.499
I haven't.

53:10.416 --> 53:12.415
Pili, it's me.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.415
From a booth, I can't find my phone.
Maybe the boy took it.

53:20.583 --> 53:22.499
I've been calling all morning.

53:23.291 --> 53:25.915
No, your place.
I don't know your cellphone number.

53:28.291 --> 53:31.040
Okay, I'll take it down later.

53:32.041 --> 53:33.832
Good, better, more relaxed.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.124
Have you seen Curro?
Have you spoken to him?

53:40.250 --> 53:41.665
What did you say to him?

53:46.041 --> 53:49.624
I don't know what to do.
My head's going to explode.

53:52.291 --> 53:54.665
I don't know, a few days.
It's nice here.

53:59.041 --> 54:02.457
No, José's not here.
He went to Madrid to do some stuff.

54:04.666 --> 54:07.707
Listen, don't tell my brother, okay?

54:09.500 --> 54:12.290
Okay. Thanks.

54:13.916 --> 54:15.249
You too.

54:16.291 --> 54:17.874
'Bye.

54:19.500 --> 54:22.915
You're so silly. Alright, see you.

54:25.375 --> 54:26.040
Shall we go?

55:45.083 --> 55:46.582
It was Juanjo, I put it on silent.

55:58.041 --> 56:02.040
Third gear's loose,
you have to work the clutch.

56:08.541 --> 56:11.290
- Take it to a garage.
- What?

56:11.791 --> 56:13.332
You're teaching me to drive now?

56:13.875 --> 56:15.457
Are you gonna fix my clutch?

56:17.291 --> 56:19.749
- What are you doing?
- It slipped.

56:19.916 --> 56:22.040
Don't let it slip, relax.

56:22.625 --> 56:24.290
And turn on the lights.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.290
- Stop here.
- What?

56:36.458 --> 56:37.957
Stop here.

56:59.833 --> 57:03.832
JUANJO: WHERE ARE YOU
AND MY SISTER?

57:18.500 --> 57:20.915
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

57:21.291 --> 57:22.749
We want a room.

57:24.250 --> 57:25.290
One each?

57:25.458 --> 57:27.082
No, one. For the two of us.

57:28.833 --> 57:31.540
- I've only got them with a double bed.
- That's fine.

57:33.333 --> 57:34.665
ID, please.

57:37.916 --> 57:38.915
Is one enough?

57:43.333 --> 57:44.540
105.

57:44.750 --> 57:48.415
The stairs are down the end
on the right.

58:43.041 --> 58:46.374
Our wedding was three months away
when it happened.

58:51.833 --> 58:53.999
When I got to the hospital
she was still alive.

58:56.625 --> 58:58.874
They had her lying on the bed,

59:00.125 --> 59:02.374
on pain killers so that...

59:04.166 --> 59:05.665
And she didn't move.

59:09.041 --> 59:11.624
I didn't recognize her,
she was so swollen up.

59:14.125 --> 59:16.457
Her face was disfigured
by the beating.

59:20.791 --> 59:22.540
But her eyes were open...

59:23.583 --> 59:25.124
and she was looking at me...

59:28.833 --> 59:32.165
I took her hand and she...

59:32.333 --> 59:33.582
stared at me.

59:36.458 --> 59:39.582
The doctor told me not to worry,
that she was unconscious.

59:42.125 --> 59:44.040
But when we were alone...

59:48.875 --> 59:50.374
she started to cry.

59:53.041 --> 59:54.624
She was looking at me and crying.

59:58.916 --> 01:00:02.207
Then, calmly, little by little,
she faded away, but...

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.457
that image...

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.374
stayed in my head.

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.499
I can't get it out of my head.

01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:31.332
I need to go out.

01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:33.707
Alright.

01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.624
Juanjo, it's me. Juanjo?

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.999
Excuse me,
have you got a charger?

01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:15.874
Is it a thin connector?

01:01:16.916 --> 01:01:18.124
I don't have those.

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:20.457
Can I use yours to make a call?

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:23.290
It's very important.
I'll pay if you want.

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:25.832
Make it quick.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.374
Sure. Thanks.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.707
Sara.

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.957
Sarita, it's your uncle.
Put your dad on.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.582
The battery's running low,
so listen.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.999
No, Ana's fine. We argued
and she got all worked up.

01:02:01.166 --> 01:02:02.707
Be ready in case she calls back.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:06.082
In case she turns up, okay?

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:09.874
Listen, how do you know José,
your friend from the bar?

01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:12.040
No, no reason.

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:16.207
No, I'm not thinking anything.
Be ready in case she calls.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.457
Right, 'bye.

01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:42.457
Eva, honey, two cigars.

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:49.582
Thanks, babe.

01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:54.707
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:57.332
Black coffee
with a dash of cognac.

01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:51.374
I want to settle up.

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:53.749
- "Good morning".
- Yes, sorry. Good morning.

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.499
The key, please.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:56.874
I'll get the car.

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.165
Feeling better?

01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:04.832
Now you're worried about me?

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:08.040
I just want this to be over.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.707
I understand you.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.790
I don't want to think about
how much you've suffered all this time.

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.374
If it happened to me...

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.165
- Are you from Extremadura?
- What?

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.207
You've got an accent
from Extremadura or thereabouts.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:30.957
No.

01:05:43.666 --> 01:05:45.207
Can I ask you a question?

01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:51.082
Did you sleep with her?

01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.374
Are you really asking me?

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:29.040
Fuck!

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.707
Hi. Excuse me,
we're looking for Julio.

01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:44.124
He came here to live
from Madrid three years ago.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:47.249
I don't know, ask at the square,
they're coming out of Mass.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:48.249
Okay. Thanks.

01:06:48.416 --> 01:06:50.040
You're welcome.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.665
- He's called Julio.
- As if there were no Julios here.

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:09.457
What about a surname?
There are lots here, son.

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.165
I don't know, he's from Madrid.

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:14.124
- From Madrid...
- It could be "Filipindú",

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.874
but if that's all you've got...
Is he tall, blond, dark hair, brown hair?

01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:20.540
There are lots, Maribel.
Aunt Luisa's Julio,

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:23.290
Julio from Trapale,
your cousin Juliete too...

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:26.749
- My aunt Marina's Julio, plus...
- Yes, Julio from Tagones.

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:29.832
10 or 12 of them.
Don't you have a last name?

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:38.124
The Lord be with you.

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:41.665
May the blessing of God Almighty,

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.915
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit,

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:47.624
be upon you.

01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:51.790
- You may go in peace.
- Give thanks to God.

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:54.082
Happy holidays, everyone.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.999
What are you doing here?

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:52.415
Nothing, I was passing through
and I wanted to say hi.

01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.665
This is José.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:01.999
Hello!

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.624
This is Curro,
a friend from the neighborhood.

01:10:06.791 --> 01:10:08.082
What a coincidence.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:11.665
Yes, my buddy and I were
passing through... This is José.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:14.082
- Nice to meet you.
- Carmen.

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:15.790
She's my wife.

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:28.665
Are you in a team?

01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:32.332
- What?
- The sweaters, I mean.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:36.165
No, it's advertising.
A friend's gym.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.165
Boxing.

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:42.457
Is that why you've got...?
From boxing?

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.457
No, I got attacked.

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:48.124
But it's nothing, I'm fine now.

01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:53.457
Are you still living
in the neighborhood?

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.457
No, I've been away.

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:58.332
Where?

01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.790
Traveling, a lot.

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.290
But outside of Spain?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.082
That too.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.124
Where have you been to?

01:11:08.625 --> 01:11:09.957
Portugal, France...

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:12.790
France! Where?

01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.749
- France. Paris mostly.
- Paris?

01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:19.832
I lived in Paris for two years,
with my aunt and uncle.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.999
Where did you stay?

01:11:25.916 --> 01:11:28.124
We were in Le Marais,
near the Pompidou.

01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:31.790
- Oh, you too?
- We lived together there for a while.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:35.415
I love traveling, but I can't
drag him away from here.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.749
He's afraid of flying!

01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:42.249
Sorry!

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:44.832
Sorry.

01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:47.874
We have to go one day.

01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:50.249
Paris is pretty, isn't it?

01:11:50.416 --> 01:11:52.207
Yeah, very.

01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.582
We saw Santi.

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:59.040
He told us about Rober.

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:03.874
A friend of yours?

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:07.790
An acquaintance from the neighborhood,
he died in a car crash.

01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:15.040
- Are you from there too?
- No, I met him later.

01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:21.374
Like some more
or shall I bring out the meat?

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:26.749
Thank you.

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:33.665
What's going on, Curro?

01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:40.124
Honey, help me with this!

01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:43.540
We should talk later.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.749
How's your family?

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.999
It's all good. I had a kid.

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.999
Yeah, so I heard.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:13.999
We're going to be parents too.

01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:17.082
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.249
You can't see it yet,

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:21.415
but I'm 15 weeks,
so now I can tell people.

01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:22.624
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:24.082
Yeah, congratulations.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.915
We don't know yet,
but I think it's a boy.

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:29.665
- Yes. It's not the best time, but...
- How come?

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:35.374
- We're a bit tight for money.
- You're not working?

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:39.832
Not now. We've got some land
nearby that was her dad's.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.207
It's got pigs, sheep...

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:45.832
I make what I can from it,
but it's just a patch of land.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.790
But it's well looked after.

01:13:50.666 --> 01:13:53.790
If you like, I can show you now.
I have to feed the pigs.

01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.332
What do you want?

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:19.249
Why have you come?

01:14:19.416 --> 01:14:20.624
To see you.

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:26.374
Don't worry, he knows everything.

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:32.665
What do you want? Money?

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:37.082
No. We're on a trip, I told you.
We stopped by to see you.

01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:46.957
Stop here, Curro. Stop here.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:14:58.374
Look, Curro,

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:01.290
I'm grateful to you for everything.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.124
And I'm sorry.

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:09.082
But I don't want any trouble.

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:13.374
I'm nothing like what I was then.

01:15:15.541 --> 01:15:18.707
- I know.
- I'm doing great now.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.499
You've got my number now, right?
If you need anything, call me.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:29.040
But I don't want any trouble. Please.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.957
What are you doing?

01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:14.290
Please, please. I'm going to be
a father. Please, I'm begging you.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:20.165
Please! They told me
it was in and out,

01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:22.374
that no one would get hurt.
He set off the alarm...

01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:24.915
- Why did you kill them?
- I didn't do anything!

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:27.332
I was scared shitless,
I swear to God!

01:17:39.791 --> 01:17:42.582
I told them to just go!
I swear! They didn't listen to me!

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:45.624
- You beat them to death, you fucks!
- I didn't do anything.

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.457
I was scared shitless, I swear to God!

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:50.874
- You beat them to death!
- I told them to just go, I swear!

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:53.165
The alarm went off,
Santi jumped on the counter

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:56.207
and started yelling,
then Juanjo went crazy.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:17:59.415
Juanjo...?

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.457
Rober?

01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:07.999
Rober didn't...?

01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:11.499
Juanjo?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.915
No!

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:02.540
Get in the trunk.

01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:08.665
In the trunk.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.082
What about Ana?

01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:34.082
<i>Come on, cut it out.
Stop it, that's enough!</i>

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.082
JEWELRY STORE

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:45.374
Pili, it's me.
Is my brother there?

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:48.124
Can you come get us?

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:50.540
Where is he?

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:54.332
No, I'll call.

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:03.874
Yeah?

01:24:04.041 --> 01:24:06.374
Where did you get to?
I've been calling you...

01:24:10.041 --> 01:24:11.124
What?

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:20.540
What did you tell Pili?

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:23.915
Have you spoken to Curro?

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.624
Where are you?

01:32:02.666 --> 01:32:05.374
