01:43.715 --> 01:44.657
Come on.

01:49.368 --> 01:50.222
Hey, guys.

01:52.017 --> 01:53.537
Erm, I was just...

01:54.862 --> 01:56.631
wanted to see if you're still up.

01:59.724 --> 02:00.346
But...

03:20.471 --> 03:21.546
Are you OK?

03:22.773 --> 03:23.857
Me? I'm fine.

03:32.177 --> 03:34.631
You don't know me, but if you did,
you'd know I'm always fine.

03:57.724 --> 03:58.853
What about your drink?

03:59.662 --> 04:00.880
You can keep it.

<i>'Destination reached.</i>

05:04.586 --> 05:06.480
<i>'Scanning successful.'</i>

05:27.991 --> 05:28.977
<i>I'll shave his hand?</i>

05:29.520 --> 05:31.777
<i>- I'll shake his hand.
- I'll shape his hand.</i>

05:31.777 --> 05:34.847
<i>Shake his hand!
Shake his hand.</i>

05:35.084 --> 05:37.395
Hello! Hi.

05:38.000 --> 05:38.702
<i>I'll sha...</i>

05:38.850 --> 05:41.324
<i>ke his hand...
kis hand.</i>

06:43.751 --> 06:46.675
No... No... No...

06:46.790 --> 06:49.715
No... No... Oh, no.

06:52.924 --> 06:54.124
I'm going to stay in tonight.

06:57.386 --> 06:58.560
You don't feel so good?

06:59.208 --> 07:00.142
I'm fine.

08:05.945 --> 08:07.634
I wanted to say thank you.

08:11.368 --> 08:12.426
Which I didn't get to say.

08:13.555 --> 08:14.408
Last time.

08:20.577 --> 08:22.240
I just had a hunch.

08:25.351 --> 08:28.675
Sometimes you have to take a chance, right?
Otherwise, how do you know?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.847
Obviously I got this wrong.

08:38.746 --> 08:39.929
Oh, sorry.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.186
My name's Danny.

09:07.751 --> 09:08.791
My name is Joe.

09:12.044 --> 09:13.342
So Joe, are you...

09:17.870 --> 09:18.560
Are...

09:22.355 --> 09:24.560
I've run out of questions. Erm...

09:24.666 --> 09:25.440
Ask me.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.297
Please.

09:28.222 --> 09:29.377
Are you out?

09:32.195 --> 09:32.995
No.

09:36.648 --> 09:39.884
If you want to go,
I can understand that reaction.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.271
I don't want to go.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.040
I work for an investment bank.

09:51.724 --> 09:52.862
It's their apartment.

09:53.973 --> 09:55.511
Security is a concern.

10:16.355 --> 10:17.360
There's a terrace...

10:20.551 --> 10:22.960
If you want to smoke, I mean.

10:29.742 --> 10:30.844
I'm going to take a shower.

11:21.262 --> 11:22.293
I'll let you get dressed.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.062
I can pay.

12:34.355 --> 12:35.626
No, it's fine, I'm...

12:41.733 --> 12:43.031
I must be easy to read.

12:43.822 --> 12:44.648
You are.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.248
Is that bad?

12:49.973 --> 12:51.191
Makes a change.

12:51.724 --> 12:53.155
The people I work with...

12:54.080 --> 12:55.404
are inscrutable.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.413
I can be inscrutable.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.431
Did you look through my clothes?

13:13.866 --> 13:14.453
See you.

14:05.555 --> 14:06.373
Has he rung?

14:08.382 --> 14:09.164
He will.

14:10.408 --> 14:11.137
A week?

14:11.502 --> 14:14.195
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life. Why?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.835
Because... That can't be it.

14:17.688 --> 14:18.977
There's more. There has to be.

14:19.555 --> 14:21.150
You love falling in love.

14:21.635 --> 14:24.044
The moment when it's all
possibilities and dreams.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.466
You think he's out of my league?

14:27.777 --> 14:29.982
The thought never crossed my mind.

14:33.795 --> 14:35.182
Where are we going to drink tonight?

14:35.582 --> 14:38.488
Somewhere dimly lit
and terribly old-fashioned.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.662
So we're on the doorstep, saying goodbye.

14:44.897 --> 14:48.151
And I'm trying to give him Pavel's number,
because I don't have a phone

14:49.582 --> 14:50.977
except he doesn't write it down.

14:50.970 --> 14:52.115
And I'm like...

14:53.422 --> 14:54.302
"If you don't want to...

14:54.906 --> 14:56.631
"if you don't want see me again..."

14:57.640 --> 14:58.755
And then he says,

14:59.724 --> 15:02.610
"Numbers, Danny, I have no problem with."

15:04.453 --> 15:07.820
Like he could remember
every phone number in the world.

15:09.831 --> 15:12.506
And then... we shook hands!

15:14.604 --> 15:15.800
If you'd have told me a week ago

15:15.800 --> 15:18.498
I'd be this happy with a handshake
at the end of a date...

15:18.888 --> 15:20.640
I'm sorry. I'll stop talking about him.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.328
- It's all right, I understand.
- It's just the feeling, you know?

15:26.035 --> 15:28.080
Not being able to think about anyone else.

15:28.622 --> 15:30.640
Yeah.
I know the feeling.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.324
Yeah, course.

16:03.822 --> 16:05.093
Otherwise, how do you know?

16:18.142 --> 16:20.426
So at some point you're going
to talk about yourself, right?

16:23.164 --> 16:24.631
Not your work, I understand.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.253
That's, er, secret.

16:28.168 --> 16:29.786
But, erm, the other stuff?

16:30.426 --> 16:31.040
Why?

16:32.577 --> 16:34.373
Isn't that what you do when you meet someone?

16:34.370 --> 16:36.275
I tell you stuff. You tell me stuff.

17:10.702 --> 17:11.768
This is us.

18:00.364 --> 18:01.271
So grown-up.

18:03.262 --> 18:06.310
You drink tea out of a thermos,
and you go for...

18:07.111 --> 18:08.408
country walks.

18:10.071 --> 18:11.244
I must seem young...

18:13.386 --> 18:15.502
compared to the people you work with.

18:17.857 --> 18:18.524
You do.

18:23.413 --> 18:24.577
You're not joking, are you?

18:25.262 --> 18:27.706
I started university when I was 15.

18:30.782 --> 18:33.271
So you never... messed around?

18:34.960 --> 18:36.711
In what sense? Any sense.

18:40.675 --> 18:43.520
I've been serious for a very long time.

18:45.262 --> 18:46.346
What made you change your mind?

18:48.275 --> 18:49.422
About? About me.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.937
I wondered what it would be like
to do these walks with someone.

18:55.128 --> 18:57.102
For a minute I was worried
that you were going to say

18:57.102 --> 18:58.398
it was cos I made you laugh.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.471
I don't think you've ever made me laugh.

19:04.524 --> 19:05.662
It's not that you won't...

19:06.835 --> 19:08.942
- I understand.
- I'm sure you will.
- I understand.

19:11.795 --> 19:13.875
So you turn up, on my doorstep...

19:14.488 --> 19:15.493
Which is wonderful!

19:16.346 --> 19:18.773
except I never told you where I live.

19:20.008 --> 19:24.000
And I was wondering, and I should say
in advance that I don't mind,

19:24.746 --> 19:25.440
but...

19:27.031 --> 19:31.810
did you carry out some kind of background
check on me?

19:35.093 --> 19:37.795
The way we met was unusual.

19:38.773 --> 19:39.591
Right.

19:40.337 --> 19:41.137
So...

19:42.222 --> 19:45.760
you thought <i>"Stranger! Seduction!"</i>

19:46.062 --> 19:49.960
Not that, erm, I'm presuming
you're seduced by me.

19:50.515 --> 19:51.404
That's, erm...

19:52.844 --> 19:54.213
process ongoing.

19:56.142 --> 19:57.528
Erm, what was I saying?

19:58.142 --> 19:59.617
Erm, yeah, so you thought,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.711
our meeting was part of...

20:04.275 --> 20:05.235
a set-up?

20:08.177 --> 20:09.617
It's fine. It's fun. I just...

20:10.257 --> 20:11.742
I thought you said I was easy to read?

20:25.066 --> 20:27.297
That would've been the reason you were selected.

20:32.275 --> 20:33.866
The appearance of innocence.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.302
I'm not innocent.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.337
You might be the only innocent person I know.

20:51.555 --> 20:53.297
Can you tell me what your real name is now?

21:00.213 --> 21:01.484
My name is Alex.

21:07.626 --> 21:09.493
I'd like you to come up...

21:11.475 --> 21:12.951
If you want, obviously.

21:14.835 --> 21:17.217
If you don't, that's cool. <i>I want to.</i>
I didn't mean to say "cool".

21:19.057 --> 21:19.911
You want to.

21:24.488 --> 21:25.004
But...

21:27.946 --> 21:29.191
It's a little fast.

21:33.013 --> 21:33.982
Well, maybe next time.

21:34.871 --> 21:36.755
You've got to stop shaking my hand.
I'm sorry.

21:38.568 --> 21:39.368
I'm sorry.

21:41.484 --> 21:42.044
OK.

21:58.693 --> 21:59.475
Fuck!

22:30.853 --> 22:32.355
It's normally tidier than this.

22:36.782 --> 22:38.000
It's never tidier than this.

23:24.257 --> 23:25.466
Had you guessed?

23:26.968 --> 23:29.617
Mmm, I'd guessed you hadn't
slept with guys before.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.924
I'd thought maybe you'd slept
with a couple of women.

23:42.506 --> 23:43.688
Can I ask you a question?

23:44.933 --> 23:45.448
Mmm.

23:47.315 --> 23:48.577
What's stopped you?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.662
You don't have to answer.

23:57.004 --> 24:01.760
How do you admit to someone
you've never been in a relationship?

24:04.684 --> 24:05.795
Who wants to hear?

24:09.057 --> 24:10.808
And when they do, who wants to stay?

24:13.386 --> 24:14.257
I do.

24:18.613 --> 24:20.257
At school I was old.

24:24.773 --> 24:26.604
At university I was young.

24:28.764 --> 24:29.875
I've always been...

24:31.768 --> 24:34.951
out of step with the people around me.

24:39.582 --> 24:41.226
In the end, I left it so late...

24:42.880 --> 24:43.920
I gave up.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.515
I told myself I was all about the mind.

24:47.155 --> 24:49.315
And people found me odd.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.217
It grated on them.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.111
I could see it in their eyes.

25:00.844 --> 25:02.400
And rather than change, I...

25:04.542 --> 25:07.093
I started playing the role, more and more.

25:10.427 --> 25:11.740
I didn't need anyone.

25:16.453 --> 25:17.662
That's what I told myself.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.911
"I didn't want anyone."

25:22.746 --> 25:25.280
Did you imagine you'd spend
the rest of your life alone?

25:27.066 --> 25:27.742
Yes.

25:30.791 --> 25:33.173
I can't begin to understand
what that must feel like.

25:36.213 --> 25:38.320
You always knew you'd find someone?
Always.

25:42.782 --> 25:43.973
I can't imagine...

25:45.457 --> 25:46.435
what that must feel like.

25:51.324 --> 25:52.533
I'd like to try again.

25:54.728 --> 25:55.608
We don't have to.

25:56.231 --> 25:56.951
You don't want...?

25:57.786 --> 25:58.960
We can wait.

26:02.408 --> 26:03.671
I've waited long enough.

26:18.853 --> 26:19.546
Drugs?

26:20.017 --> 26:23.235
I've been using them to make me
believe the sex was special.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.471
That the person I was with was special.

26:28.097 --> 26:28.657
But...

26:30.391 --> 26:32.488
I'd love to know what it feels like for real.

26:34.190 --> 26:36.017
Because I bet it's
the best feeling in the world.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.928
Will you stop worrying about me?

26:57.511 --> 26:59.022
Will you stop worrying about ME?

28:06.515 --> 28:07.440
You saw me.

28:10.195 --> 28:11.760
What I mean is, you saw ME.

28:15.324 --> 28:16.871
And you asked if I was OK.

28:19.893 --> 28:22.097
And not like most people ask it.
Like they've...

28:23.410 --> 28:25.422
asked it a hundred times that day already,

28:25.422 --> 28:26.539
you asked it as if...

28:30.142 --> 28:31.591
nothing else mattered to you.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.008
And I thought,

28:39.048 --> 28:41.235
how is it that this person,
who I've never seen before...

28:43.857 --> 28:47.591
How are they the only person
in the whole world who knows?

28:50.506 --> 28:51.660
That I'm not OK.

28:56.746 --> 28:59.170
And I was sure if I could
just find out your name,

28:59.170 --> 29:00.933
if I could just find out who you were...

29:03.288 --> 29:04.675
then everything would be OK.

29:07.795 --> 29:08.960
What if everything...

29:09.866 --> 29:10.808
isn't OK?

29:11.306 --> 29:12.533
Then we tell each other.

29:13.066 --> 29:14.008
And we deal with it.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.813
Whatever it is, we...

29:19.120 --> 29:19.822
deal with it.

29:22.266 --> 29:22.924
Together.

29:30.684 --> 29:31.928
Is there something you want to tell me?

29:33.724 --> 29:34.284
No.

30:40.933 --> 30:42.533
I'm excited you two are going to meet.

30:47.191 --> 30:48.586
I should've organized it sooner.

30:51.813 --> 30:53.528
A month or two, I could understand.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.764
I'm not so old I can't remember
what it's like to be smitten.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.900
But eight months listening to you
declare how wonderful he is,

31:01.900 --> 31:04.622
while failing to introduce us feels wilful.

31:05.173 --> 31:05.804
Sorry.

31:24.435 --> 31:26.471
Scottie, this is Alex.

31:35.813 --> 31:38.088
Alex, tell me.

31:40.195 --> 31:41.182
What did you make of her?

31:43.751 --> 31:44.391
Too much?

31:46.168 --> 31:47.502
That doesn't surprise me.

31:48.844 --> 31:51.662
Danny's always preferred his men
to be as straight as possible.

31:51.715 --> 31:53.724
A tedious form of self-loathing,

31:53.760 --> 31:56.328
that I've unsuccessfully tried
to wean him off.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.946
Scottie, I was telling Alex...

31:57.940 --> 32:00.133
I hope you told him this is
where we first met?

32:01.380 --> 32:03.315
You must be wondering
how an old queer like me

32:03.310 --> 32:05.688
ended up friends with
a handsome young man like him?

32:06.888 --> 32:09.990
19 years old, he walked through that door.

32:11.617 --> 32:13.457
As lost as a person could be.

32:16.124 --> 32:18.542
I saw him, in his tatty jeans,

32:18.540 --> 32:21.004
with his cropped hair,
and his puppy dog eyes.

32:22.222 --> 32:24.826
I could guess his sad story
without hearing a word.

32:28.195 --> 32:28.968
I presumed,

32:29.582 --> 32:31.066
if I bought him a drink,

32:31.617 --> 32:35.564
there wouldn't be a single second when he
wasn't hoping for someone better to come along.

32:38.195 --> 32:40.000
But what can I say? I'm a soft touch.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.546
So I bought him that drink...

32:42.693 --> 32:45.306
and to my surprise,
he talked to me for the whole night.

32:46.222 --> 32:48.506
He didn't leave,
even when others stalked him.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.610
A small gesture, but it meant a great deal.

32:54.177 --> 32:55.742
And we've been friends ever since.

32:56.835 --> 32:59.048
I'm the one he comes to when times are tough.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.084
And they often are.

33:02.986 --> 33:06.791
Poor Danny has a terrible track record
for picking the wrong man.

33:08.222 --> 33:09.973
He's an insufferable romantic.

33:10.385 --> 33:11.657
One of the last.

33:15.066 --> 33:16.960
Does it fall to me to say...

33:18.373 --> 33:20.444
don't break his heart?

33:23.191 --> 33:24.675
I could never hurt Danny.

33:26.391 --> 33:27.280
May I ask,

33:28.284 --> 33:31.137
as someone who's been witness
to the breaking of many a heart...

33:32.506 --> 33:34.088
how you can be so sure?

33:41.191 --> 33:42.960
Because he is the only friend I have.

33:49.502 --> 33:50.755
I'm pleased for you.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.844
I'm pleased for both of you.

34:00.302 --> 34:01.537
Had you two met before?

34:03.528 --> 34:04.035
No.

34:19.208 --> 34:22.462
You know Scottie asked
if you knew how I became his friend?

34:23.297 --> 34:25.110
Danny, you don't need to tell me anything.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.043
I love you.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.568
And I need you to know.

34:32.746 --> 34:33.884
I was 19.

34:35.670 --> 34:36.675
Like he said.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.031
It was a bad time.

34:45.831 --> 34:48.417
I'd left home. I was doing a lot of drugs.

34:51.813 --> 34:52.951
And one night...

34:54.791 --> 34:55.751
I was wired.

34:58.675 --> 35:00.213
Not happy, not high.

35:02.951 --> 35:03.777
I was numb.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.653
And I posted an ad online...

35:11.173 --> 35:13.075
saying that anyone could come round.

35:13.768 --> 35:15.617
And I mean anyone.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.682
My only condition was that they didn't speak.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.942
And people showed up.

35:27.866 --> 35:30.737
I didn't turn them away.
I didn't ask anything of them.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.884
And they must have thought
their luck was in, cos...

35:35.404 --> 35:36.595
they didn't make a sound.

35:43.493 --> 35:46.560
The next day, I couldn't stop crying.

35:49.395 --> 35:50.702
And I went to see Scottie.

35:52.808 --> 35:53.635
I didn't...

35:56.204 --> 35:59.813
know him very well, I'd only met him a couple of times.
But he was the only person I could trust.

36:03.084 --> 36:04.817
And he took me straight to the hospital.

36:07.884 --> 36:10.062
And I was put me on a course of PEP,

36:10.222 --> 36:12.746
which is, erm, emergency medication.

36:13.644 --> 36:16.008
I was on the drugs for 28 days.

36:16.355 --> 36:17.911
And Scottie looked after me.

36:22.890 --> 36:25.511
And 16 weeks later I had an HIV test.

36:30.515 --> 36:31.484
And I was clear.

36:35.884 --> 36:36.728
Sorry.

36:49.866 --> 36:51.520
And we were friends.

37:04.951 --> 37:06.613
I've never done anything like that again.

37:09.297 --> 37:10.426
I swear.

37:10.951 --> 37:12.204
I was out of my mind.

37:20.506 --> 37:21.768
I'm always safe.

37:22.151 --> 37:23.031
Always.

37:28.551 --> 37:30.568
I don't know what happened to me that night.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.666
I look back, I don't recognise that person.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.897
And I've never cheated on you.

37:43.591 --> 37:45.120
I don't want to have any secrets from you.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.853
I never want to have any secrets ever again.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.857
Let's go away for the weekend.

38:24.266 --> 38:24.924
Sure.

38:36.026 --> 38:38.400
I have to buy a battery for my laptop.

38:40.302 --> 38:42.008
I can't go without replacing it.

38:45.502 --> 38:46.480
I understand.

39:44.426 --> 39:45.840
Has Alex called for me?

39:49.900 --> 39:51.173
Has Alex called?!

40:26.942 --> 40:27.786
How long?

40:32.417 --> 40:33.297
11 days.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.320
What happened?

40:39.946 --> 40:40.977
I told him.

40:41.084 --> 40:42.053
That you loved him?

40:43.173 --> 40:44.702
How you and I became friends.

40:45.635 --> 40:46.728
That was a mistake.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.142
Why didn't I shut my mouth?!

40:53.084 --> 40:54.604
Because you needed to know.

40:57.466 --> 40:58.613
Could he still love you?

41:01.493 --> 41:02.773
I fucked it up. I...

41:04.337 --> 41:06.151
I'd fucked it up before I'd even met him.

41:08.862 --> 41:09.946
Have you tried everything?

41:16.506 --> 41:19.066
Well, there's only one thing left to do.
Accept that it's over.

41:19.333 --> 41:20.186
I can't.

41:20.648 --> 41:21.946
What other choice do you have?

41:25.600 --> 41:26.542
You'll get over it.

41:27.795 --> 41:29.493
Not quickly. Not completely.

41:29.777 --> 41:31.137
But enough to carry on.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.191
Trust me on that.

41:35.937 --> 41:37.973
But now, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.

41:38.071 --> 41:39.022
I have work to do.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.142
You want me to leave?

41:42.560 --> 41:43.688
I'd never ask you to leave!

41:43.875 --> 41:45.493
Rest here. Sleep, eat.

41:46.595 --> 41:48.951
But today, I can't play assistant
to your personal life.

41:56.364 --> 41:57.875
Just out of curiosity...

41:59.733 --> 42:01.360
did you ever wonder what I might want?

42:02.915 --> 42:03.884
What <i>you</i> want?

42:08.204 --> 42:09.253
What do you want?

42:16.675 --> 42:17.493
Do you want this?

42:21.004 --> 42:22.080
Is this what you want?!

42:25.671 --> 42:28.275
What do I owe you? Five nights?
Ten nights? Tell me!

42:42.400 --> 42:43.626
Scottie, I'm sorry, I...

42:44.657 --> 42:45.377
I'm sorry.

43:31.631 --> 43:32.923
We should call the police.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.453
Nothing was taken.

43:34.530 --> 43:36.551
We couldn't even give our stuff away.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.293
<i>'System rebooting.</i>

44:52.773 --> 44:54.817
<i>'Item for Danny Holt.'</i>

45:49.146 --> 45:50.853
<i>'Destination reached.'</i>

46:47.911 --> 46:48.737
Alex?

47:02.000 --> 47:02.728
Alex?

48:39.777 --> 48:40.497
Alex?

53:27.080 --> 53:28.462
Aah!

54:00.062 --> 54:00.835
Police, please.

55:17.484 --> 55:18.900
<i>Police, can you open up, please?</i>

55:36.382 --> 55:37.742
<i>OPEN THIS DOOR!</i>

55:42.542 --> 55:43.777
Step aside, sir.

55:58.986 --> 56:00.222
His name's Alex.

56:03.946 --> 56:05.271
He's my partner.

56:08.808 --> 56:09.777
It's his apartment.

56:10.826 --> 56:12.764
He disappeared two weeks ago.

56:14.764 --> 56:15.911
Do you think it might not be him?

56:20.871 --> 56:23.004
Tell me what you know about... Alex.

56:38.026 --> 56:39.066
He's a genius.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.000
He went to university at the age of 15.

56:51.004 --> 56:53.635
He's got no family. His parents are dead.

56:58.897 --> 56:59.795
Erm...

57:01.573 --> 57:03.395
He works for an investment bank.

57:08.284 --> 57:09.520
What else do you need to know?

57:13.528 --> 57:15.280
Do you know...

57:17.466 --> 57:18.364
this man?

57:19.893 --> 57:21.697
Yes. This is Alex.

57:22.773 --> 57:23.635
Your partner?

57:27.288 --> 57:28.071
Yeah.

57:28.835 --> 57:30.648
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

57:31.262 --> 57:32.666
Did it involve sadism?

57:33.146 --> 57:34.382
Drugs? No.

57:34.380 --> 57:36.320
You see, it's hard for me to believe

57:36.320 --> 57:38.124
you were in a serious relationship...

57:39.626 --> 57:41.093
when you don't even know his name.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.190
This man is called Alistair.

57:46.426 --> 57:47.822
His parents are alive.

57:48.346 --> 57:50.110
He did not work for a bank.

57:58.951 --> 58:00.115
Is it possible...

58:00.773 --> 58:03.342
you enjoyed extreme sexual encounters

58:03.340 --> 58:05.537
with someone who didn't want you
to know their name?

58:09.111 --> 58:09.911
Is it possible?

58:17.057 --> 58:18.320
This will stop.

58:18.817 --> 58:20.008
Right now.

58:42.568 --> 58:43.288
He lied.

58:45.608 --> 58:46.435
About everything.

58:50.248 --> 58:51.608
When you introduced us...

58:52.471 --> 58:53.271
You knew?

58:53.760 --> 58:55.450
Not exactly.

58:56.340 --> 58:58.097
Our paths had never crossed. But...

58:58.151 --> 58:59.555
I recognised the type.

59:00.986 --> 59:02.773
I see them in the corridors of Whitehall.

59:03.831 --> 59:06.151
People with power, and secrets.

59:06.480 --> 59:09.250
Their importance emanates from them.
I felt it.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.248
He worked for MI6.

59:14.702 --> 59:15.751
He was a spy.

59:52.088 --> 59:52.800
Er, Danny?

59:54.684 --> 59:57.813
The police were concerned you might've
taken something from the crime scene.

59:58.035 --> 01:00:00.600
A personal item?
Something of sentimental value.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.355
You wouldn't have done that, would you?

01:00:04.746 --> 01:00:05.626
Course not.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.840
No. Course not.
