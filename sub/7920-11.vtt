WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.060
Okay, well, it's too small
to be a cat hotel

00:03.062 --> 00:05.228
and it's too big
to be pants.

00:05.230 --> 00:08.231
So it's not mine. Me neither. I pick
up all my deliveries at the port.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.133
The what? At the port?
Yeah.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.469
What are you doing at the port?
Picking up my deliveries. Listen.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.271
(wry chuckle)

00:14.273 --> 00:15.906
You drive all the
way down to the port?

00:15.908 --> 00:18.408
Yes. Well, it's not mine.
I only buy local.

00:18.410 --> 00:21.244
Except, of course, for clothing
and produce. Medication,

00:21.246 --> 00:23.747
water, seasoning, meat.
Maybe it's Cece's.

00:23.749 --> 00:25.782
Isn't she packing up her apartment?
It's not Cece's.

00:25.784 --> 00:27.784
She's packing right now, and
Jess is going over there later

00:27.786 --> 00:30.988
to toast the place good-bye.
'Cause they're adorable.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.923
Would you consider us adorable?
No,

00:32.925 --> 00:35.759
we're adult men.
We're cute.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.961
Oh, hey! (chuckles)

00:37.963 --> 00:39.963
My box is here.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.466
Do you need help?
Oh...

00:42.468 --> 00:44.935
Yeah, I was just gonna put it...
Put it down right there.

00:44.937 --> 00:45.969
Awesome.
Jess, is it me,

00:45.971 --> 00:47.304
or has your job

00:47.306 --> 00:49.506
become a poo poo festival?

00:49.508 --> 00:53.110
No, it's fine. It's just the new
principal, Becky Cavatappi.

00:53.112 --> 00:56.313
She took over for Foster when he
retired. I do all her work

00:56.315 --> 00:59.116
and she does all the working
of her cleavage.

00:59.118 --> 01:01.952
(class bell rings) But the
budget's your job, Becky.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.453
Ah-- Principal Cavatappi.

01:03.455 --> 01:05.288
Like I always say:

01:05.290 --> 01:07.824
don't call me Becky unless
you're riding me like a horse.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.159
(laughs)

01:09.161 --> 01:10.193
We work in a middle school.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.194
(forced laughter)

01:11.196 --> 01:12.796
Really.

01:12.798 --> 01:16.767
This is the budget,
or the next week of my life.

01:17.636 --> 01:19.302
You know what they say--

01:19.304 --> 01:22.005
your life is just weeks
and then you die.

01:22.007 --> 01:23.306
Uh, Jess,

01:23.308 --> 01:24.674
are you sure you're okay? Yeah.

01:24.676 --> 01:26.643
I just got this
for a little stress relief.

01:26.645 --> 01:28.812
(laughs)
Oh, Schmidt,

01:28.814 --> 01:30.547
will you be a dear and text Cece

01:30.549 --> 01:32.649
and tell her I'm gonna be about,
like, ten minutes late?

01:32.651 --> 01:33.817
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

01:33.819 --> 01:34.851
Aah!

01:34.853 --> 01:36.653
(grunting, screaming)

01:36.655 --> 01:38.822
Becky! Becky!

01:38.824 --> 01:40.991

Long week of work ahead of me.

02:03.849 --> 02:06.183
I'm looking forward to a fun night!
Okay, Jess, I should

02:06.185 --> 02:08.518
tell you before I...

02:08.520 --> 02:11.021
I know I said I was done
packing, but I'm not done,

02:11.023 --> 02:12.689
and the reason I'm not done is
because I didn't do anything,

02:12.691 --> 02:14.524
and I have to get
out before tomorrow,

02:14.526 --> 02:15.859

my deposit.

Hey, Winston.

I did it.
I told Aly I need a new partner.

02:30.242 --> 02:32.542
What? I thought you had
a crush on her. Yeah.

02:32.544 --> 02:34.244
Well, exactly. You know,
here's the problem.

02:34.246 --> 02:36.580
She keeps talking about her
boyfriend and his, quote:

02:36.582 --> 02:38.715
"ass that you want to
open on Christmas."

02:38.717 --> 02:39.716
What?
But it's fine.

02:39.718 --> 02:40.717
You know, she took it

02:40.719 --> 02:41.718
better than I thought.

key chain fart marker,

over a hundred yogurt tops,

02:49.394 --> 02:50.894
your flattened penny collection,

02:50.896 --> 02:53.730

Guys, as they say,
when one chapter ends,

03:24.263 --> 03:26.930
a bridge appears,
and then you cross that bridge

03:26.932 --> 03:29.099
and make lemonade
out of a molehill.

03:29.101 --> 03:30.834
Okay.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.936
Hiya, partner.
(laughs)

03:32.938 --> 03:35.605
That's, uh, "hi" in karate.
Hiya!

That's cool.

to some car jams, do you?

for these two.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.862
I wouldn't trust him
to watch a ball pit.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.298
Hey, could I get a cream soda?

04:03.635 --> 04:05.368
Don't. It's not cool.

04:10.175 --> 04:11.875

We have a flasher.

You know what, maybe if we
get drunk, then, magically,

04:16.815 --> 04:18.315
everything will just happen.

04:18.317 --> 04:19.316
No, no.

04:19.318 --> 04:20.684
No drinking until you've packed.

04:20.686 --> 04:21.985
Look, I get

04:21.987 --> 04:23.653
that you're freaking out
about moving,

04:23.655 --> 04:25.488
but we can do this.
We need to make

04:25.490 --> 04:27.324
a keep pile
and a toss pile, okay?

04:27.326 --> 04:28.825
Keep or toss, keep or toss.

04:28.827 --> 04:31.328
(phone chiming)
Ugh.

04:31.330 --> 04:34.831
Uh... Hi, Becky.
Sorry, Principal Cavatappi.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.733
Jess, remember that binder?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.501
Yeah.
Yup, I've got it right here.

04:38.503 --> 04:39.669
I'll have it done

04:39.671 --> 04:41.171
by the end of the week.

04:41.173 --> 04:43.573
Yeah, I mixed up
the budget due date.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.841
I took my contacts out

04:44.843 --> 04:46.042
'cause they're ugly.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.844
So I kind of can't read stuff.

04:47.846 --> 04:48.912
I'll need it tomorrow.

04:50.349 --> 04:52.349
Um... Uh, yeah,

04:52.351 --> 04:53.717
uh, but it's a week's
worth of work.

04:53.719 --> 04:56.353
You get it done or you're fired.
(hangs up)

04:56.355 --> 04:59.322
I have to do a week's
worth of work in a night.

05:00.525 --> 05:02.025
So we got to get
through this quick.

05:02.027 --> 05:03.927
Keep or toss, keep or toss.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.862
Cece, that sweatshirt
has a wine stain on it

05:05.864 --> 05:07.864
and an off-brand
Looney Tunes character.

05:07.866 --> 05:10.400
George Bunny?
Who the hell is that?

05:10.402 --> 05:11.935
You're right.
Keep.

05:11.937 --> 05:12.769
Toss!
No, keep, keep!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.376
I'm calling the cops. There is
a man pulling out his privates

05:19.378 --> 05:21.044
in our bar.
Oh, big whoop.

05:21.046 --> 05:23.213
It used to be worse.
It used to be more interactive.

05:23.215 --> 05:24.948
What do mean, interactive?
Interactive.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.950
You showed, too?
No, it was more like tennis,

05:26.952 --> 05:28.885
like...

05:28.887 --> 05:30.220
Exit.

05:34.593 --> 05:36.226

This is a problem.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.065
New partner
is working out great, man.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.767
You know, we have a lot
in common.

05:43.769 --> 05:46.136

05:46.138 --> 05:47.804
me, color, him, night.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.973
Well, that sounds dangerous.
Winston, listen to me.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.474
We have some very serious
police business here.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.777
The bar has a flasher.
A strange man

05:53.779 --> 05:56.579
is regularly showing Nick
his funky soup bone.

05:56.581 --> 05:58.148
I'm sure he doesn't even care.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.251
I care about that greatly, Nick.
I will be right there.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.453
Whoa, partner.
Oh, oh,

06:03.455 --> 06:05.655
oh, my goodness. Hey, didn't see...
Seat's taken.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.258
the seat was taken there, Winston, I...
Yeah, I usually ride shotgun

06:08.260 --> 06:11.428
because I get motion sickness
as a decision-maker.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.263
Yeah, well, I lose
all hand strength

06:13.265 --> 06:15.865
with absolutely no warning.
Just...

06:16.935 --> 06:18.268
Damn it.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.237
Mm... I'm sorry,
I'll be fast. Mm...

06:23.442 --> 06:25.275
Mm...

06:25.277 --> 06:28.111
Mm...

06:28.113 --> 06:30.280
Time's up.
It's a toss.

06:30.282 --> 06:31.815
No, that was actually an award.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.016
Toss. Next.
Jessica...

06:35.454 --> 06:37.854
Now, okay, look, that hat
has a very important memory.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.457
Hey.

06:40.459 --> 06:43.193
I'm sorry I'm so bad
at doggy-style.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.695
Do you really want to remember
Sir Miss-A-Lot?

06:45.697 --> 06:48.031
This is all important stuff
from my single life.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.617
I think I need to go
through the pile again.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.333
You know what,

06:50.335 --> 06:52.469
you're right. Let's go through
everything again.

06:52.471 --> 06:53.970
Can you just come with me
to the hallway

06:53.972 --> 06:55.872
and take a look
at a pile I made out there?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.140
Oh, yeah, okay.

06:57.142 --> 06:59.476
I just really appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.

06:59.478 --> 07:01.144
I know you got
a lot of work to do.

07:01.146 --> 07:02.178
Yeah, so it's...

07:02.180 --> 07:03.813
(gasps)

07:03.815 --> 07:06.316
I have to finish packing
so I can work on the binder!

07:06.318 --> 07:08.885
You made me do this!
I'm shutting this tiny door!

07:08.887 --> 07:11.154
Jessica, open the door!
You're a terrible packer!

07:11.156 --> 07:12.989
Jessica, open the door!

07:12.991 --> 07:15.658
Your favorite team is
the Green Bay...<i> Not</i> Packers.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.193
Let me in, okay?
Because, you know,

07:17.195 --> 07:18.328
if I'm out here too long,
I'm gonna run into...

07:18.330 --> 07:21.231
Hey, neighbor, you dig turtles?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.332
It's not a big deal.

07:22.334 --> 07:23.833
I've been flashed by, like,

07:23.835 --> 07:25.735
seven or eight different
people since college.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.203
What?
You guys have been flashed?

07:27.205 --> 07:28.204
No.
Never.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.672
Everybody's been flashed

07:29.674 --> 07:32.175
countless times, right?
No.

07:32.177 --> 07:35.512
Oh, it's just me who's been
flashed about 300 times?

07:35.514 --> 07:38.181
What? You guys have
never been flashed?

07:38.183 --> 07:39.682
No.
Never.

07:39.684 --> 07:41.718
Not even on, like, holidays?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.019
BOTH:
No!

07:43.021 --> 07:44.421
Not even, like,
after the Olympics?

07:44.423 --> 07:45.889
Hey, guys, I still
can't find the bathroom.

07:45.891 --> 07:47.590

it was again?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.025

07:49.027 --> 07:51.261

it's one big room, buddy.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.230
Never mind. I don't have
to go anymore.

07:54.232 --> 07:56.032
No, no, no, no,
you're fine, you're fine.

07:56.034 --> 07:58.034
You've had, like, two tubs
of soda. You-you need to go.

07:58.036 --> 07:59.102
Yeah, I do have to go.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.370
It's right back there
to the left.

08:00.372 --> 08:01.271
Okay.
Yeah, right past

08:01.273 --> 08:02.372

08:02.374 --> 08:04.707

08:04.709 --> 08:06.109
Oh.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.210
Just responding

08:07.212 --> 08:08.378
to a call about a flasher.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.380
Oh, yes. Uh, there is no need.

08:10.382 --> 08:12.081
Dunston and I have
got this, so...

08:12.083 --> 08:13.883
Oh, how is Dunston?

08:13.885 --> 08:16.953
Huh? I hear he's blind and weird.
No. No, he's great.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.389
Ah. Dunston gets it done...
ston.

08:19.391 --> 08:22.125
And that's how we win.. ston!

08:22.127 --> 08:23.293
(laughing) Oh.  (laughing)

08:23.295 --> 08:24.961
How are you?
Really good.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.763
Mm-hmm. Yeah, Hutch
is one hell of a cop.

08:26.765 --> 08:27.931
HUTCH:
I'm very strong.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.265
Punch my stomach. Try.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.567
I mean, I will.
It won't hurt.

08:30.569 --> 08:31.835
(laughing): Okay. It won't hurt.

08:32.904 --> 08:33.970
(laughing): God.  Mm-hmm.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.138
That's amazing.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.573
Dunston. Bathroom.
Yeah?

08:36.575 --> 08:37.941
Oh, that's right.

08:37.943 --> 08:39.576
Dunston?
Ah.

08:39.578 --> 08:42.579
Dunston?
No, I know.

08:42.581 --> 08:44.314
(laughing)
You're in good hands.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.316
I hope you're happy, too.
Great!

08:46.318 --> 08:47.750
Great!
Great.

08:47.752 --> 08:48.852
Great!

08:49.821 --> 08:51.955
Somebody call the G8 Summit

08:51.957 --> 08:54.157
because I just felt
the climate change.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.258
I don't get that.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.160
Hmm.
Excuse me.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.162
You know where
the bathroom is?

08:59.164 --> 09:02.098
It's not back here.
Right.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
If you throw out one more thing,

09:04.102 --> 09:06.336
I am gonna hurl my body
against the door!

09:06.338 --> 09:08.671
Okay, fine, I am gonna do it.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.240
I hope I don't hurt myself!

09:12.277 --> 09:14.811
(crying):
Ow!

09:14.813 --> 09:16.112
You think
I don't know those were hands?

09:16.114 --> 09:17.614
That was a slap sound!
Yeah.

09:17.616 --> 09:19.449
Okay, you're right,
it's a slapping sound,

09:19.451 --> 09:22.819
but I-I, I think I overdid it
and I really hurt my wrist.

09:22.821 --> 09:24.787
It's, like, swelling.

09:24.789 --> 09:26.789
I'm telling you the truth, okay?
It really hurts.

09:26.791 --> 09:28.825
Just, can you please
open the door?

09:28.827 --> 09:30.460
And now my wrists are fine!
(screaming)

09:30.462 --> 09:31.694
You snake!
You rattlesnake!

09:32.998 --> 09:34.664
(sighs)

09:34.666 --> 09:37.000
CECE: Oh, my God, everything's gone.
Look, Cece,

09:37.002 --> 09:39.168
I know you're freaking out
about leaving the apartment,

09:39.170 --> 09:40.837
but if you think
of it like...

09:40.839 --> 09:43.006
No. It's just, it's not
just the apartment.

09:43.008 --> 09:45.508
It's just... it's...
it's all of it.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.143
Everything is changing!

09:47.145 --> 09:48.811
I'm not gonna have
this place anymore,

09:48.813 --> 09:50.113
and I'm getting married.

09:52.017 --> 09:53.383
(sighs)

09:53.385 --> 09:55.318
Oh, my God, Jess,
I'm getting married.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.654
Are you having second thoughts?
No, no. I... I know I want

09:57.656 --> 09:59.822
to marry Schmidt more
than anything in the world.

09:59.824 --> 10:03.826
It's just... everything is
gonna change, and I am scared.

10:03.828 --> 10:05.328
Oh, honey.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.997
Oh, my little
breakfast link.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.166
Okay, now, look,
we don't have time for this.

10:10.168 --> 10:12.035
Okay, you have to work
on your binder.

10:12.037 --> 10:14.671
(sighs)

10:14.673 --> 10:17.240
Forget the binder.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.075
Right now, this is
more important.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.511
So you know what we're gonna do?
What?

10:21.513 --> 10:24.013
We're gonna get

10:24.015 --> 10:25.682
into it!

10:25.684 --> 10:27.450
I'm gonna take my pants off!
What? Why?

10:32.023 --> 10:33.523
So, Nick, can you describe the suspect?
Mr. Miller, can you describe the suspect?

10:33.525 --> 10:34.891
Uh, are you doing
the interview, or...?

10:34.893 --> 10:36.025
Oh, yeah, I'm usually
the interview guy.

10:36.027 --> 10:37.894
Oh, that's okay.
No, you can take it.

10:37.896 --> 10:40.096
I'll take it, dude, if it's not a big deal.
Hey, well, it can be either...

10:40.098 --> 10:42.365
No, I'm used to it, too, but you're used
to it, so it's not a big deal for me.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.866
Well, I mean, I'm used to it,
but I'm open to new things.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.068
Okay, yeah,
but to the count of three.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.202
Just-just-just please...
We're just gonna do it.

10:46.204 --> 10:47.236
BOTH:
One, two, three.

10:47.238 --> 10:48.438
You do it.  I can...
I'm gonna go.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.374
He was average size, thin,
wispy blond hair.

10:51.376 --> 10:53.543
Oddly shaped,
kind of came to a point.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.211
Uh, what does that mean?
Top heavy.

10:55.213 --> 10:57.880
A bit of a scar as if like
from a hook or something.

10:57.882 --> 11:00.216
Gross. Ugh. Uh,
anything else?

11:00.218 --> 11:01.718
I think that about does it.
You want me to describe

11:01.720 --> 11:02.885
what his face
and body looked like?

11:02.887 --> 11:04.454
Yeah, that'd be... Wait.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.556
Have you been describing
his penis this whole time?

11:06.558 --> 11:07.790
All right, that's it. I'm done.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.058
I'm not even the one
that called you guys.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.426
Man!
And to be fair,

11:10.428 --> 11:12.962
I knew he was talking about
a penis the whole time. See?

11:12.964 --> 11:14.964
That is way too real!

11:14.966 --> 11:16.899
Aggressively detailed.

11:16.901 --> 11:18.267
I had to guess
on the testicles,

11:18.269 --> 11:19.636
'cause he hadn't
described 'em.

11:22.407 --> 11:25.742
You know what it is? It's just
that there's no turning back.

11:25.744 --> 11:28.077
I mean, who am I when
I leave this apartment?

11:28.079 --> 11:30.079
"Mrs. Cece Schmidt?"

11:30.081 --> 11:33.916
"Cece Schmidt" sounds like
the mayor of an evil Swiss town.

11:33.918 --> 11:34.917
(laughter)
It does.

11:34.919 --> 11:36.586
Oh, my God.

11:36.588 --> 11:37.954
Did I tell you
that Schmidt thinks

11:37.956 --> 11:39.822
that we should drop
our last names

11:39.824 --> 11:41.257
and make up a new one?

11:41.259 --> 11:43.159
He is currently,
at the moment,

11:43.161 --> 11:46.429
leaning towards Zenith
and Telluride.

11:46.431 --> 11:48.831
I don't hate Telluride.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.000
Getting married
is just such a big leap.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.002
You leap big all the time!

11:53.004 --> 11:55.838
You moved here at 18 with
nothing but a bunch of chokers.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.440
Isn't it amazing?!

11:57.442 --> 11:58.941
And it's mine.

11:58.943 --> 12:01.678
JESS: Yeah, there's also
a knife stuck in the wall.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.679
Oh, look!

12:02.681 --> 12:03.846
Someone left a spoon

12:03.848 --> 12:04.847
with some rock candy in it.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.349
I wonder what flavor it is.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.451
This is a way bigger leap.
(phone plays tune)

12:08.453 --> 12:11.621
Ugh! Becky!
You sloppy boob lizard!

12:11.623 --> 12:13.156
Principal Cavatappi!

12:13.158 --> 12:16.359
Oh, yeah, the binder.
Yup, I've got it right...

12:17.796 --> 12:19.829
...here.

12:19.831 --> 12:21.464
(whispers): Where's the binder?
(gasps)

12:21.466 --> 12:22.965
Um, yeah, uh, sorry.
Uh...

12:22.967 --> 12:24.701
Um, yeah,
I've got it right here.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.469
(whispering):
Find it. Find it.

12:26.471 --> 12:27.804
You packed it somewhere?!

12:27.806 --> 12:30.373
Yeah, I can turn to page 13.
Hold on.  Oh. Chuka.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.874
Chuka, chuka, chuka.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.142
Chuka. (whispering):
What is that?

12:33.144 --> 12:34.310
That was a page-turning noise.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.379
Chuka, chuka...
Um, yup, I see the graph.

12:36.381 --> 12:40.316
Chuk, chuka,
chuk, chuk!

12:40.318 --> 12:41.818
Jess?
(sighs)

12:41.820 --> 12:43.419
Do you remember Rosarito?!

12:45.390 --> 12:47.890
We don't have much to go on,
but I'll run your description.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.325
Hopefully, Dunston
wouldn't have

12:49.327 --> 12:51.494
spilled coffee all
over the radio.

12:51.496 --> 12:55.798
You know, he brews his own and
drinks it out of a sandwich bag.

12:57.502 --> 12:58.501
SCHMIDT:
Winston,

12:58.503 --> 12:59.836
just call Aly and tell her

12:59.838 --> 13:01.237
that you want to be
partners again.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.239
Ugh. Look, guys, I...

13:03.241 --> 13:05.041
I cannot.

13:05.043 --> 13:07.577
I just cannot hear
about Aly's boyfriend

13:07.579 --> 13:10.546
and his ass
that don't quit, okay?

13:10.548 --> 13:13.082
My ass don't quit!
What about my ass?!

13:13.084 --> 13:16.352
Winston, please call Aly.
Seriously, dude.

13:16.354 --> 13:18.755
There he is.  FLASHER:
Hey, do you have

13:18.757 --> 13:20.189
any, uh...?
Freeze, buddy!

13:20.191 --> 13:21.924
Oh, yeah, freeze!

13:21.926 --> 13:23.426
Wait! Hey!
(groans)

13:23.428 --> 13:24.694
Oh.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

13:24.696 --> 13:26.028
(grunting, thudding)

13:26.030 --> 13:27.530
Yeah! Got him!
(laughing)

13:27.532 --> 13:29.699
All right! Dunston!

13:29.701 --> 13:31.601
Oh, yes. Yeah, man.
I'm not normally

13:31.603 --> 13:33.035
the cuff guy, but I'll do it.
Yeah, me, either.

13:33.037 --> 13:34.537
But I'll do it.
One size fits all, right?

13:34.539 --> 13:37.039
Yeah, I guess it's...
Man, I just said,

13:37.041 --> 13:39.041
I'll be the cuff guy!  I'm
not normally the cuff...

13:39.043 --> 13:40.209
But, yeah, but if
I'm not normally the...

13:40.211 --> 13:42.278
Then if you're not...
but I'm not normally.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.343
Now, I'm doing... Okay,
okay, count of three.

13:43.369 --> 13:43.713
Count of three.

13:43.715 --> 13:45.047
Who is the cuff guy? One.
All right. One.

13:45.049 --> 13:46.048
BOTH:
Two, three, four.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.717
Five, six. See?
Five. Mm.

13:47.719 --> 13:48.618
(overlapping chatter)

13:48.620 --> 13:49.886
All right. Three,
Three,

13:49.888 --> 13:51.053
BOTH:
two, one,

13:51.055 --> 13:52.889
zero, negative one.
Damn it!  That...!

13:52.891 --> 13:54.724
Winston, Dunston! Dunston!

13:54.726 --> 13:55.558
Go!
Hey!

13:55.560 --> 13:58.227
(both grunt)

13:58.229 --> 13:59.562
(sighs)

13:59.564 --> 14:01.564
I got to say...

14:01.566 --> 14:03.599
he never comes in
twice in a night.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.568
I just hope he's okay.

14:05.570 --> 14:08.471
I'm alarmed by how connected
to this man you feel.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.807
I just hope
the best for him.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.743
I am so dead.

14:13.745 --> 14:15.745
If I don't find
this binder, I'm gonna

14:15.747 --> 14:17.780
need a really good excuse.
Oh, wait, Cece?  Mm.

14:17.782 --> 14:19.749
Can you break my arm
just a little bit?

14:19.751 --> 14:22.251
No! You're right. It's
better if I do it myself.

14:22.253 --> 14:23.252
Okay, you know what? Hey!

14:23.254 --> 14:25.755
Hey, can I just throw
something out there?

14:25.757 --> 14:27.256
What if you quit?

14:27.258 --> 14:28.591
I want to quit.

14:28.593 --> 14:31.093
God, do I want to quit,
but I can't! I can't!

14:31.095 --> 14:35.431
You can quit. Because this Becky
lady is making you miserable.

14:35.433 --> 14:38.768
You were always someone
who loved their job.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.771
♪ It's my first day of teaching
in L.A. ♪

14:41.773 --> 14:43.172
♪ And I'm giving my job ♪

14:43.174 --> 14:47.577
♪ A big fat "A..." ♪

14:49.113 --> 14:51.113
You remember the last time
I was unemployed?

14:51.115 --> 14:53.015
I ran out of things to knit.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.452
I knit a condom.
Oh, the yarn-dom.

14:56.454 --> 14:58.788
I pray this was never used.
Okay, remember earlier

14:58.790 --> 15:00.289
when you told me to leap?

15:00.291 --> 15:02.291
You should leap.

15:02.293 --> 15:03.626
I don't leap.

15:03.628 --> 15:07.029
I take small planned steps,
like an arthritic dog.

15:11.135 --> 15:13.202
Really?

15:16.641 --> 15:18.975
The last listing
is a loft downtown.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.476
Bad area.

15:20.478 --> 15:23.646
The ad just says
it's "sunsoaked and beige-y."

15:23.648 --> 15:26.782
I don't know. They seem
like three nice girls.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.557
And now I am marrying one
of those girls

15:34.559 --> 15:36.492
and totally freaking out
about it.

15:36.494 --> 15:37.827
You know
who you need to talk to, right?

15:37.829 --> 15:40.329
Yes. Definitely. Winston.
No.

15:40.331 --> 15:41.664
What the hell?
What?

15:41.666 --> 15:43.332
I'm gone for two months,
and all of a sudden

15:43.334 --> 15:45.501
Winston's a bridesmaid?
Never mind.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.169
You need to call Schmidt.
No.

15:47.171 --> 15:49.739
No, I can't call him
and tell him that I'm scared.

15:49.741 --> 15:53.109
I think that
that's what getting married is.

15:54.178 --> 15:56.512
Sharing all this,

15:56.514 --> 15:58.014
all the things you're afraid of,

15:58.016 --> 16:00.349
all the things
that embarrass you,

16:00.351 --> 16:01.651
weak doggy-style guy.

16:05.857 --> 16:06.856
You got to call Schmidt.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.925
All right.

16:10.194 --> 16:12.528
(phone rings)
A voice call, Jess?

16:12.530 --> 16:15.531
Let me guess, a family of ducks
is crossing the street.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.867
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's me. It's me. Um, so...

16:17.869 --> 16:19.201
okay, um,

16:19.203 --> 16:22.204
I love you but I am freaking out
about getting married.

16:22.206 --> 16:24.040
Cece, what? What's-what's
going on? What's happening?

16:24.042 --> 16:26.709
Well, I just... I don't...
I don't... (phone chimes)

16:26.711 --> 16:28.044
Oh, no. Um,

16:28.046 --> 16:29.712
Jess, it's Becky. It's Becky.

16:29.714 --> 16:31.380
What-what-what
do you want me to do?

16:31.382 --> 16:32.720
What do I do? What do I do?
Don't answer it.

16:32.746 --> 16:33.415
Don't answer it.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.885
What? Who's Becky? What's
a Becky? What's happening?

16:35.887 --> 16:38.054
(phone chiming)

16:38.056 --> 16:39.221
Don't answer it.

16:39.223 --> 16:40.222
Do not

16:40.224 --> 16:41.223
answer it.

16:41.225 --> 16:42.391
I'm gonna answer it.

16:42.393 --> 16:43.125
What?

16:43.127 --> 16:45.094
Hello! Hi. Uh, yeah,

16:45.096 --> 16:47.296
so, this is Cece Parikh, and
you are treating my friend

16:47.298 --> 16:49.065
very badly.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.733
What? Put Jess on.

16:50.735 --> 16:54.270
No, no, no, no. You are
done using my friend, okay?

16:54.272 --> 16:56.472
So she... quits.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.139
I what?

16:57.141 --> 16:58.240
She what?

16:58.242 --> 16:59.241
I what?
That's right!

16:59.243 --> 17:01.811
Jess quits!

17:05.083 --> 17:08.150
Nailed it!

17:11.422 --> 17:14.156
Oh, my God, the binder.
It's under the couch.

17:21.466 --> 17:22.832
No, no, no.
We handled it.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.933
It's our perp.
Aly,

17:23.935 --> 17:25.935
I want you back. I...

17:25.937 --> 17:27.603
I-I want you back.
Are you trying

17:27.605 --> 17:30.172
to tell me something
or doing a Jackson 5 song?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.774
I miss having you as my partner.

17:31.776 --> 17:35.444
(scoffs) Do you want
to tell me why you left?

17:35.446 --> 17:37.947
'Cause you never did.
And, honestly, Winston,

17:37.949 --> 17:39.615
that really sucked.

17:39.617 --> 17:41.117
I left
because you hurt my feelings

17:41.119 --> 17:44.520
when you kept talking about...

17:45.690 --> 17:48.858
You kept talking about...

17:50.628 --> 17:53.529
...how much you hate my music.
You know?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.698
This is
about your<i> Pure Moods</i> CD?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.134
That's it. That's all.
It's the only reason why I left.

17:58.136 --> 18:01.037
Okay. I mean, that thing
makes me wish I was born

18:01.039 --> 18:03.039
without the ability
to hear music,

18:03.041 --> 18:05.141
but if it means that much
to you,

18:05.143 --> 18:07.977
I'll listen to it.

18:07.979 --> 18:10.980
I-I-I appreciate that.

18:10.982 --> 18:13.215
Look, you're the only partner
I want.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.151
You make me...

18:15.153 --> 18:17.553
laugh and whatever.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.889
I don't know.
I suck at compliments.

18:19.891 --> 18:20.656
Yeah.

18:20.658 --> 18:22.391
Partners?

18:23.327 --> 18:25.161
Partners.

18:25.163 --> 18:27.329
Shake it. Don't just hold it.

18:27.331 --> 18:28.898
Yeah. Sorry.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.332
(Dunston panting)

18:30.334 --> 18:32.068
I think that was Dunston.
How did

18:32.070 --> 18:34.070
he not see us?
No idea.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.072
Oh, yeah, he's
night-blind.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.407
Dunston!

18:39.844 --> 18:42.011
It's done. Everything
you asked for.

18:42.013 --> 18:43.879
And, Principal Cavatappi,
I'm very sorry

18:43.881 --> 18:45.514
for what my friend said. I...

18:45.516 --> 18:47.083
Oh, I know. I would
never let you quit anyway.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.884
Can you come up
with some thoughts on

18:48.886 --> 18:51.420
the science curriculum for the
superintendant and sign my name?

18:52.356 --> 18:54.023
Yeah.

18:54.025 --> 18:55.925
Sure. Yes.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.196
You know what? No!

19:00.198 --> 19:01.530
I can't.
(chuckles) No.

19:01.532 --> 19:03.999
Nope. Um, because I quit.

19:05.236 --> 19:07.536
I hope you have
a minor career setback,

19:07.538 --> 19:09.738
learn from it, relocate,

19:09.740 --> 19:14.610
and ultimately have
a very nice life, Becky.

19:16.047 --> 19:18.114
(groans)

19:29.260 --> 19:30.459
Mmm.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.397
Do I want to know this story?

19:35.399 --> 19:37.133
(chuckles)
I hope so,

19:37.135 --> 19:40.402
because we're about to spend
the rest of our lives together.

19:40.404 --> 19:42.905
So you're gonna have
to hear all my stories.

19:42.907 --> 19:45.441
I want to spend the rest of my
life hearing all your stories.

19:45.443 --> 19:47.243
Until, of course,
my hearing goes out

19:47.245 --> 19:50.246
and I get tinnitus. Do you know
Dave Letterman has tinnitus?

19:50.248 --> 19:52.915
Um...

19:52.917 --> 19:55.084
about-about what I said
on the phone...

19:55.086 --> 19:57.253
I'm a little freaked out, too.

19:57.255 --> 19:58.988
You are?
Yes.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.657
And it has nothing to do
with how much I love you.

20:01.659 --> 20:02.992
Exactly.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.927
Or how much
I want to get married.

20:04.929 --> 20:06.262
Exactly.

20:06.264 --> 20:08.264
We'll be scared
together.

20:08.266 --> 20:11.934
And we'll be really
happy together, too.

20:11.936 --> 20:14.003
And we'll be really
annoyed together,

20:14.005 --> 20:16.438
knowing that we're living with
three other people and a cat.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.940
Also, I think
there's another cat.

20:17.942 --> 20:20.009
Winston's being very
evasive about it, but...

20:20.011 --> 20:21.544
Mmm.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.185
It's a foster cat.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.120
I think it's helping him
get over the whole Aly thing.

20:31.122 --> 20:32.121
I don't care.

20:32.123 --> 20:33.455
Well, I guess this is it.

20:33.457 --> 20:35.324
I thought Jess would be here,
but...

20:35.326 --> 20:38.661
you know, okay, end of an era.
Yeah.

20:38.663 --> 20:40.196
(quietly): Have you
ever been here before?

20:40.198 --> 20:43.465
This is maybe
my second time.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.701
I nursed my pippy back
to health here.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.037
(chuckling):
Yeah. I remember.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.039
All right. I'm gonna
give you a minute.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.807
Okay.

20:51.809 --> 20:53.876
(sighs)

21:00.151 --> 21:02.218
JESS:
Cece, Cece, Cece.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.323
Do you want to do the honors
or should I?

21:07.325 --> 21:09.592
Hmm... Go for it.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.628
(exhales)

21:14.165 --> 21:15.564
CECE: Okay.
One, two, three.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.666
(chuckles) We did it!
(chuckles)

21:17.668 --> 21:19.001
JESS: Oh, my God,
there's hair on the end!

21:19.003 --> 21:20.736
(gasps)
Put it back! Put it back!

21:20.738 --> 21:22.137
(door opens)

21:30.715 --> 21:32.448
(sniffles)

21:34.919 --> 21:35.918
JESS:
<i> Do you speak Russian?</i>

21:35.920 --> 21:37.886
CECE:
<i> Nope.</i>

21:37.888 --> 21:39.922
