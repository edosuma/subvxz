00:02.879 --> 00:04.078
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:04.297 --> 00:07.137
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:08.541
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:08.718 --> 00:11.598
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:13.164
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:13.306 --> 00:16.306
<i>Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

00:16.559 --> 00:17.799
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:17.936 --> 00:20.976
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

00:21.357 --> 00:22.517
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:26.050
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:27.680
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

00:28.114 --> 00:29.354
Prepare!

00:32.618 --> 00:36.058
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

00:36.498 --> 00:40.898
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.

00:41.587 --> 00:44.987
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

00:48.386 --> 00:50.666
Class, we have visitors.

00:57.437 --> 01:00.197
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

01:00.608 --> 01:02.648
Afraid the facts mixed up.

01:03.193 --> 01:06.553
Now you get your boy on the mat
or you and I will have a major problem.

01:06.781 --> 01:09.141
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

01:10.827 --> 01:12.267
Name a place.

01:12.912 --> 01:14.272
Tournament.

01:15.749 --> 01:17.869
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

01:21.380 --> 01:23.740
<i>Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!</i>

01:24.884 --> 01:26.484
Time out, time out.

01:26.761 --> 01:28.921
<i>Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.</i>

01:29.639 --> 01:31.799
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!

01:33.477 --> 01:34.957
Sweep the leg.

01:37.147 --> 01:39.027
You have a problem with that?

01:41.277 --> 01:42.637
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

01:44.530 --> 01:45.810
No mercy.

01:52.622 --> 01:55.062
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.

01:55.875 --> 01:56.675
Ready?

01:56.793 --> 01:58.833
No mercy! No mercy!

01:59.129 --> 02:00.729
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

02:00.881 --> 02:02.241
Finish him!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074

02:11.727 --> 02:12.927
Winner!

02:21.487 --> 02:22.767
Now who's the loser?

02:22.905 --> 02:24.585
You're really sick, man.

02:24.782 --> 02:26.862
How does second place feel now?

02:27.034 --> 02:28.994
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

02:29.162 --> 02:32.362
<i>- You're gonna kill him.
- Sensei, please. You're hurting him.</i>

02:32.582 --> 02:34.702
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

02:36.295 --> 02:37.335
Let him go.

02:37.462 --> 02:39.502
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

03:13.585 --> 03:15.425
"Mercy is for the weak.

03:16.004 --> 03:18.524
"We do not train to be merciful here.

03:19.049 --> 03:21.409
"A man face you, he is enemy.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.189
"Enemy deserve no mercy."

03:39.821 --> 03:41.141
<i>Come, Daniel-san.</i>

03:41.490 --> 03:42.930
Time go home.

03:43.575 --> 03:46.055
<i>- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.</i>

03:46.245 --> 03:47.565
Why didn't you then?

03:47.706 --> 03:51.346
<i>Because, Daniel-san,
for person with no forgiveness in heart...</i>

03:51.584 --> 03:54.384
<i>... living even worse punishment
than death.</i>

04:59.158 --> 05:03.078
<i>Sensei Kreese, this is Pat Johnson
from the All Valley Tournament.</i>

05:03.329 --> 05:05.209
<i>We're sorry you lost all your students.</i>

05:05.373 --> 05:08.253
<i>I guess the Cobra Kai won't
enter the tournament this year.</i>

05:08.459 --> 05:10.979
<i>We've made repeated requests
for payments of dues...</i>

05:11.170 --> 05:13.370
<i>... but since you've failed to respond...</i>

05:13.549 --> 05:16.629
<i>... we have to drop the Cobra Kai
from our membership rolls.</i>

05:16.843 --> 05:19.843
<i>If you have any questions, give me a call.
Have a nice day.</i>

05:20.055 --> 05:21.775
<i>Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.</i>

05:21.933 --> 05:25.973
<i>This is the final call regarding your bill,
and if you do not pay immediately...</i>

05:38.242 --> 05:41.722
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

05:42.371 --> 05:44.451
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.

05:44.623 --> 05:45.823
Thanks.

06:25.710 --> 06:26.790
Come on!

06:35.220 --> 06:37.420
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.

06:39.225 --> 06:40.905
Johnny!

06:41.811 --> 06:43.291
What a surprise, man!

06:43.480 --> 06:44.560
Yes!

06:46.483 --> 06:47.963
What's this? You moving in?

06:48.109 --> 06:50.629
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.260
<i>- Here are the dojo keys.
- What are you talking about?</i>

06:53.448 --> 06:55.008
I'll pay you that back rent soon.

06:55.158 --> 06:58.158
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.

06:58.370 --> 06:59.450
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

06:59.580 --> 07:01.060
The plutonium deal.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.370
Johnny, every business has a slump
at one time or another.

07:04.586 --> 07:06.906
Ten years ago
nuclear was the preferred waste.

07:07.088 --> 07:09.808
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

07:10.008 --> 07:12.808
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year
without being indicted.

07:13.012 --> 07:14.012
Thank you.

07:14.137 --> 07:15.297
Let's get some air.

07:15.431 --> 07:18.351
It's been nine months since a student
walked through my doors.

07:18.559 --> 07:21.199
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.

07:21.396 --> 07:22.636
I can't.

07:23.147 --> 07:25.467
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.

07:26.818 --> 07:28.018
You're wrong.

07:28.779 --> 07:30.499
You're going to Tahiti.

07:30.947 --> 07:31.627
Now.

07:32.407 --> 07:34.487
All right, I've made up my mind.

07:34.659 --> 07:36.899
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...

07:37.079 --> 07:38.919
...I'll get them for what they did to you.

07:39.081 --> 07:41.361
They made you suffer,
so I'll make them suffer.

07:42.585 --> 07:45.945
When I think they've suffered enough,
then I start with the pain.

07:46.172 --> 07:49.532
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.759
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.

07:52.262 --> 07:54.702
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

07:55.515 --> 07:57.755
Say it! Cobra Kai.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.175
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.394
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.125
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.238
How many times did you save my ass?

08:07.404 --> 08:10.044
I don't know. I lost count.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.005
Get the hell out of here.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.261
Have a good trip, Captain.

08:27.634 --> 08:32.154
<i>The White Zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

08:33.472 --> 08:34.592
Smog.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.966
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?

08:39.145 --> 08:42.706
<i>Daniel-san,
why mother not here to meet you?</i>

08:42.942 --> 08:44.822
You tell her right flight number?

08:44.986 --> 08:47.786
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

08:47.989 --> 08:51.229
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.

08:51.826 --> 08:52.826
Hope so.

08:52.953 --> 08:57.233
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

08:59.085 --> 09:01.125
<i>106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!</i>

09:25.780 --> 09:27.580
What are you doing in my cab?

09:27.740 --> 09:31.060
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.

09:31.286 --> 09:34.046
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.

09:34.248 --> 09:36.488
I got a message for you from your mother.

09:36.667 --> 09:41.827
I told you that bum would sell the place
and you'd be out of a job someday.

09:42.131 --> 09:43.851
You wouldn't listen to me.

09:44.009 --> 09:45.529
- What's the message?
- What message?

09:45.677 --> 09:48.917
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.

09:50.974 --> 09:53.254
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

09:54.729 --> 09:56.929
<i>Daniel-san room all finished.</i>

09:57.481 --> 10:01.521
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.

10:01.861 --> 10:04.261
I might be here for a few months.

10:04.531 --> 10:08.131
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

10:08.660 --> 10:11.980
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

10:12.206 --> 10:13.566
No problem.

10:13.790 --> 10:14.790
Pleasure.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.477
<i>Mr. Miyagi, thank you.</i>

10:16.919 --> 10:20.279
<i>Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-san.</i>

10:20.839 --> 10:21.919
Nice mama.

10:22.550 --> 10:24.310
You sure you don't need me there?

10:24.468 --> 10:27.348
<i>No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi
and start college.</i>

10:27.973 --> 10:31.973
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?

10:32.227 --> 10:34.507
<i>It's this Tuesday.
And classes start Thursday.</i>

10:34.688 --> 10:36.448
And when is Kumiko arriving?

10:38.484 --> 10:39.524
She's not.

10:39.652 --> 10:43.932
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.600
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...

10:48.120 --> 10:49.560
You're disappointed, huh?

10:50.247 --> 10:53.487
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.788
You'll do more than just survive.

10:57.213 --> 10:58.813
I gotta go, okay?

10:58.964 --> 11:01.244
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi,
and I love you.

11:01.425 --> 11:04.065
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.

11:13.397 --> 11:15.797
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.

11:15.983 --> 11:17.823
No. I go.

11:59.155 --> 12:00.915
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

12:08.206 --> 12:10.526
Just remembering.

12:15.089 --> 12:17.889
I'll bet there are a lot of memories
here for you.

12:22.596 --> 12:24.596
So what are you going to do now?

12:28.228 --> 12:29.588
Don't know.

12:31.690 --> 12:34.690
<i>Well, did you ever think about
opening a bonsai store?</i>

12:37.863 --> 12:39.463
<i>Hai, Daniel-san.</i>

12:40.199 --> 12:41.599
In my dream.

12:42.494 --> 12:43.974
My retirement.

12:47.249 --> 12:48.849
What do you call this?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.321
Call "time to go."

13:24.122 --> 13:27.202
<i>You know, I've been thinking about
the bonsai shop idea.</i>

13:27.584 --> 13:30.464
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

13:30.838 --> 13:32.638
<i>Not too hard, Daniel-san...</i>

13:33.006 --> 13:37.806
...if Miyagi have money for lease,
deposit, fix-up.

13:38.930 --> 13:42.050
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa...

13:43.017 --> 13:45.257
...money very short supply.

13:45.436 --> 13:46.596
"Supply"?

13:48.023 --> 13:49.503
Supplies are us.

13:51.986 --> 13:54.946
<i>Thank you, Daniel-san,
but that not money.</i>

13:55.531 --> 13:59.931
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.090
Smell like college education.

14:02.246 --> 14:04.406
I know, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

14:04.666 --> 14:06.026
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

14:06.543 --> 14:07.783
No idea.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.060
Discussion closed.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.560
But what about your dream?

14:13.718 --> 14:16.998
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence,
but if you miss the train this time...

14:17.221 --> 14:19.861
...there may not be another one
for a long time.

14:20.057 --> 14:21.857
Then Miyagi take bus.

14:46.503 --> 14:49.623
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.640
<i>The day you step off the plane, you're
the biggest dojo operator in the valley.</i>

14:53.886 --> 14:55.646
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

14:55.805 --> 14:58.805
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.

14:59.017 --> 15:01.937
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

15:02.145 --> 15:03.905
<i>You're a sweetheart, that's great!</i>

15:04.272 --> 15:06.232
But what about those two jerks?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.720
<i>Those two jerks are taking up
100 percent of my time from now on.</i>

15:09.945 --> 15:12.745
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.

15:12.948 --> 15:16.788
When I'm finished with that kid,
he'll be begging me to be his teacher.

15:17.036 --> 15:18.996
You know what he's gonna learn from me?

15:19.164 --> 15:23.844
Pain in every part of his body
and fear in every part of his mind.

15:24.711 --> 15:27.271
And here's the kicker:
he's gonna thank me for it.

15:27.881 --> 15:28.961
What about the old man?

15:29.299 --> 15:30.699
Him I hurt for the kid.

15:30.842 --> 15:34.242
By the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title...

15:34.471 --> 15:37.071
...I'm gonna have him thinking
he's invincible.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.427
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean...

15:40.645 --> 15:42.685
...right in front of a thousand people.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.800
How do you know he'll compete?

15:45.150 --> 15:47.790
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.

15:47.987 --> 15:50.587
<i>Go give Mimona and her girlfriend
a squeeze for me.</i>

15:50.781 --> 15:51.981
How do you know about her?

15:52.324 --> 15:53.524
I know.

15:55.161 --> 15:57.041
<i>Anything else you want?</i>

15:58.539 --> 15:59.739
Yeah.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.415
Make his knuckles bleed.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.673
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.143
I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.431
Very good, sir.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.601
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.371
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.487
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.015
For the next few weeks,
my business is revenge.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.877
Everything is in place, sir.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.593
All right,
let's see what you've got for me.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.848
Cute but wrong.

16:37.123 --> 16:38.883
It's got no character.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.623
A truck.

16:42.671 --> 16:44.991
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.

16:45.173 --> 16:46.053
Yes, sir.

16:46.174 --> 16:48.854
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.

16:49.053 --> 16:52.373
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.

17:20.377 --> 17:21.818
"Karate's bad boy.

17:22.339 --> 17:23.499
"Mike Barnes."

17:31.682 --> 17:33.282
Perfect.

17:42.986 --> 17:44.466
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

17:44.946 --> 17:47.146
<i>Daniel-san, just in time.</i>

17:47.949 --> 17:49.429
How was fishing?

17:49.660 --> 17:51.340
We find out pretty soon.

17:52.079 --> 17:54.479
So, how first day at college?

17:54.916 --> 17:55.916
College?

17:56.709 --> 17:57.709
College...

17:59.128 --> 18:02.568
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.

18:03.758 --> 18:06.438
It's a place that I didn't go to today.

18:07.971 --> 18:08.971
What?

18:09.139 --> 18:12.699
Mr. Miyagi,
may all your dreams come true.

18:14.812 --> 18:15.932
What this?

18:16.105 --> 18:18.185
There's only one way to find out.

18:20.902 --> 18:22.582
All right, I'll tell you.

18:22.737 --> 18:24.657
It's my college diploma.

18:24.823 --> 18:27.183
- What?
- I'm only joking.

18:28.326 --> 18:30.926
<i>Daniel-san, you have sense humour.</i>

18:33.249 --> 18:34.409
"Lease."

18:35.501 --> 18:37.981
<i>For your new bonsai store.
Congratulations.</i>

18:38.880 --> 18:40.920
"One month security, two month rent."

18:41.091 --> 18:44.731
Yes. With just enough left over
for renovations, if we're careful.

18:46.096 --> 18:50.296
<i>Daniel-san, thank you very much,
but cannot accept.</i>

18:50.935 --> 18:53.495
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?

18:54.355 --> 18:57.435
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

18:58.192 --> 18:59.792
Was for college education.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.865
I know, just listen to me for a minute.

19:03.073 --> 19:06.513
I know me. I just can't take courses
to take courses.

19:06.952 --> 19:09.312
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.096
It's bye-bye college.

19:11.248 --> 19:15.248
I've been going to school non-stop
since I'm five. I could use the break.

19:16.004 --> 19:18.044
<i>- I don't know, Daniel-san.
- I do.</i>

19:18.256 --> 19:20.296
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

19:20.467 --> 19:22.107
- Come with me.
- What about fish?

19:22.260 --> 19:24.620
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.

19:27.850 --> 19:29.650
What a moment!

19:29.852 --> 19:33.052
You are now crossing over
to the right side of the tracks.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.643
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.

19:35.817 --> 19:37.537
Straight ahead. Right up there.

19:37.693 --> 19:40.413
Your dream come true,
and there's plenty of free parking.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.093
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.280
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.

19:49.707 --> 19:52.507
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.740
Now, I know you're worried
about this area...

19:55.922 --> 19:59.482
...but the landlord says
this neighbourhood is up and coming.

19:59.718 --> 20:03.638
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.

20:03.888 --> 20:06.968
<i>We could set a deal,
get some planters made up for the bonsai.</i>

20:07.184 --> 20:10.024
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

20:10.229 --> 20:12.069
This is going to be great.

20:14.692 --> 20:15.972
Come on in.

20:19.447 --> 20:22.807
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.

20:24.035 --> 20:27.075
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.

20:27.289 --> 20:29.049
We have to think potential here.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.928
Think potential, all right?

20:31.126 --> 20:33.366
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?

20:33.546 --> 20:37.426
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.

20:37.675 --> 20:40.835
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

20:41.054 --> 20:43.574
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...

20:43.765 --> 20:46.365
<i>...up here, to do like a bonsai display.</i>

20:46.559 --> 20:49.999
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

20:50.230 --> 20:52.430
You know, the possibilities are endless.

20:52.609 --> 20:55.929
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...

20:56.195 --> 20:57.715
...for a little work area.

20:57.864 --> 21:03.264
<i>Over here we got like a bonsai hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.</i>

21:03.661 --> 21:06.061
I work for free. And I thought of a name.

21:06.248 --> 21:07.408
Check it out.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.701
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."

21:10.169 --> 21:12.409
Simple, direct, catchy.

21:12.588 --> 21:15.188
It doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

21:15.382 --> 21:18.862
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

21:21.764 --> 21:24.204
What did I do? Did I forget something?

21:25.936 --> 21:27.576
Well, what did I miss?

21:27.729 --> 21:30.129
Your name on lease, next to mine.

21:31.734 --> 21:33.774
- Partner.
- Partner?

21:34.820 --> 21:37.340
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.

21:50.212 --> 21:51.692
You're welcome.

21:54.759 --> 21:55.879
What?

21:57.137 --> 21:58.817
Don't bullshit me.

21:59.097 --> 22:01.097
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

22:01.266 --> 22:03.306
Who in Borneo
knows what chloride sludge is?

22:03.477 --> 22:04.597
Just do it!

22:04.936 --> 22:06.096
Do it!

22:06.396 --> 22:08.076
Call me when it's dumped.

22:08.232 --> 22:09.552
Where were we, Margaret?

22:09.691 --> 22:12.691
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

22:12.945 --> 22:17.265
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."

22:17.575 --> 22:20.335
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...

22:21.413 --> 22:22.533
Yeah?

22:22.915 --> 22:24.435
Good, bring him in.

22:24.583 --> 22:25.703
What else?

22:25.876 --> 22:29.156
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?

22:29.380 --> 22:30.900
Bribe them, as usual.

22:31.674 --> 22:33.194
Lighten up, Margaret.

22:33.426 --> 22:35.706
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.

22:35.886 --> 22:36.926
Good.

22:37.096 --> 22:40.576
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.

22:40.809 --> 22:42.409
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.800
Mr. Silver?

22:44.479 --> 22:46.679
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.

22:46.857 --> 22:49.057
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.074
Milos, call the boys.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.911
This place is intense.

22:54.115 --> 22:56.435
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.

22:56.993 --> 22:58.553
Snake, Dennis.

22:58.703 --> 22:59.703
Mike Barnes.

22:59.830 --> 23:03.470
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.

23:03.708 --> 23:07.228
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.

23:07.462 --> 23:08.782
You know it.

23:09.715 --> 23:12.115
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?

23:12.301 --> 23:14.541
Remember on the phone you said
if I come here...

23:14.720 --> 23:17.520
...and I beat this LaRusso
in the All Valley Tournament...

23:17.724 --> 23:20.724
<i>...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership
in your new dojos?</i>

23:21.061 --> 23:23.101
Which I think is more than generous.

23:23.272 --> 23:25.432
But I've been giving it some thought.

23:25.608 --> 23:29.288
For me to do my absolute best,
which is what I want to do for you...

23:29.570 --> 23:31.810
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.180
Fifty percent?

23:36.244 --> 23:39.364
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

23:41.458 --> 23:44.418
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.

23:44.628 --> 23:46.548
It was nice meeting everybody.

23:48.257 --> 23:51.457
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.

23:51.677 --> 23:53.157
You got your 50 percent.

23:53.304 --> 23:55.984
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.

23:56.808 --> 24:00.408
You just bought yourself a champion.

24:00.645 --> 24:02.325
You remember that.

24:03.315 --> 24:05.635
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.

24:06.485 --> 24:09.285
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.463
So, what do you think?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.020
He's obnoxious.

24:18.247 --> 24:19.967
Yeah, he's perfect.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.674
<i>Very good. This make special bonsai.</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:32.205
<i>You really see a bonsai in here?</i>

24:32.805 --> 24:33.765
Where?

24:33.931 --> 24:35.011
Inside.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.341
Inside?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.359
<i>Hello, any bonsai in here?</i>

24:38.895 --> 24:42.375
<i>Daniel-san, not inside. Inside you.</i>

24:42.607 --> 24:45.007
Same place your karate come from.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.115
But my karate comes from you.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.657
Only root karate come from Miyagi.

24:52.952 --> 24:57.912
<i>Just like bonsai choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.</i>

24:59.668 --> 25:02.828
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

25:03.088 --> 25:05.168
Yeah, but I do it your way.

25:06.174 --> 25:08.934
One day you do own way.

25:15.727 --> 25:19.367
<i>Remember what you said before about
bonsai being free to grow as they choose?</i>

25:19.606 --> 25:21.686
<i>All bonsai aren't free to choose.</i>

25:21.858 --> 25:25.458
We tell them how to grow
by using clippers and then the wire.

25:26.196 --> 25:29.556
<i>But, Daniel-san,
our bonsai not true bonsai.</i>

25:29.950 --> 25:33.190
<i>True bonsai grow wild. Very rare.</i>

25:33.412 --> 25:34.812
You ever seen any?

25:35.457 --> 25:36.457
Okinawa.

25:36.666 --> 25:37.986
What about here?

25:38.127 --> 25:39.527
I only know of one.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.595
What did it do, immigrate?

25:43.590 --> 25:47.470
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.

25:47.844 --> 25:49.564
Where's the tree now?

25:50.765 --> 25:51.805
There.

25:51.975 --> 25:53.575
Devil's Caldron.

25:56.313 --> 25:57.633
Devil's Caldron?

25:58.941 --> 26:01.101
<i>No can see bonsai from here.</i>

26:01.986 --> 26:04.946
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.

26:05.155 --> 26:07.635
Why did you put it
in such a hard place to get to?

26:07.825 --> 26:10.745
<i>True original bonsai
worth many thousand dollar.</i>

26:11.454 --> 26:14.694
<i>Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family kata.</i>

26:14.916 --> 26:16.236
Now you ready.

26:16.376 --> 26:20.896
<i>Like all bonsai found in tree,
all karate found in this kata.</i>

26:21.173 --> 26:23.573
<i>Come, together we do kata.</i>

27:48.600 --> 27:50.240
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

27:50.395 --> 27:53.275
I brought this tree,
the one you were working on this morning.

27:53.481 --> 27:55.641
I thought you might want
to give it another try.

27:55.817 --> 27:56.657
Thank you.

27:56.777 --> 27:59.697
A change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside.

27:59.905 --> 28:02.105
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.

28:02.783 --> 28:04.063
Very good.

28:04.201 --> 28:07.481
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.

28:07.705 --> 28:10.145
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.

28:11.459 --> 28:12.459
Perfect.

28:14.629 --> 28:16.669
I hope you don't mind...

28:18.217 --> 28:20.417
...but I opened that letter.

28:20.594 --> 28:23.514
The one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

28:23.722 --> 28:25.682
There's a new rule this year.

28:26.976 --> 28:29.296
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.

28:29.938 --> 28:32.898
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:

28:33.107 --> 28:34.507
"Under the new rules...

28:34.651 --> 28:37.851
"...the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match."

28:38.071 --> 28:41.271
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.

28:41.825 --> 28:44.785
That's better
than what I had to put up with last year.

28:44.996 --> 28:47.836
And let's face it, it's another year.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.641
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.

28:51.086 --> 28:54.126
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

28:54.547 --> 28:56.387
- Right?
- Wrong!

28:56.550 --> 28:57.710
Wrong?

28:57.926 --> 29:00.846
<i>Should consider get
new pot for bonsai.</i>

29:01.305 --> 29:05.345
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?

29:08.062 --> 29:11.782
If karate used defend honour,
defend a life...

29:12.441 --> 29:14.681
...karate means something.

29:15.695 --> 29:18.775
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...

29:19.824 --> 29:22.184
...karate no mean nothing.

29:24.705 --> 29:26.065
Understand?

29:26.958 --> 29:28.158
I wish I did.

29:30.586 --> 29:33.826
<i>Go find a nice pot for bonsai across street.</i>

29:40.597 --> 29:42.037
Here's your pen.

29:42.767 --> 29:44.367
Before I forget.

29:47.229 --> 29:51.589
And if you have a minute,
just in case you change your mind...

29:51.860 --> 29:53.380
...here's the application.

29:53.528 --> 29:54.648
Okay?

29:56.323 --> 29:59.163
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...

29:59.367 --> 30:02.407
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

30:03.455 --> 30:06.775
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

30:08.711 --> 30:10.511
We have some time.

30:26.105 --> 30:27.265
Hello?

30:28.399 --> 30:30.479
Hi. Could you turn that off?

30:30.860 --> 30:31.860
Sure.

30:32.028 --> 30:33.228
Thanks.

30:33.405 --> 30:35.725
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

30:35.907 --> 30:37.027
That's okay.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.080
It's okay. Take your time.

30:40.621 --> 30:41.981
That's pretty cool.

30:42.164 --> 30:43.364
Thanks.

30:43.874 --> 30:45.594
So, what can I do for you?

30:45.751 --> 30:48.911
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.147
Yeah, what size?

30:54.886 --> 30:57.326
This would be good. Like this.

30:58.056 --> 31:01.256
<i>They're for bonsai trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.</i>

31:01.476 --> 31:03.436
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

31:03.604 --> 31:04.684
Thanks.

31:05.314 --> 31:06.994
<i>Yeah, I love bonsai.</i>

31:07.275 --> 31:09.475
They're so perfect, you know?

31:09.736 --> 31:13.096
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

31:13.323 --> 31:14.963
And meet my partner, too.

31:15.116 --> 31:17.076
I haven't even really met you yet.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.843
I'm sorry.

31:19.330 --> 31:21.850
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

31:22.041 --> 31:24.441
Hi. Is that you in that...

31:25.002 --> 31:26.402
Yep, that's me.

31:26.545 --> 31:29.145
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

31:30.175 --> 31:33.055
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.

31:33.428 --> 31:34.948
The pots?

31:35.097 --> 31:36.937
You know what we could do?

31:38.725 --> 31:42.165
<i>Could you put like a bonsai tree
on the side of the pot?</i>

31:42.396 --> 31:45.236
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?

31:45.441 --> 31:48.161
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.

31:48.361 --> 31:50.281
That would be great.

31:50.446 --> 31:54.526
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.450
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.

31:57.955 --> 31:58.995
How soon?

31:59.581 --> 32:01.781
How soon? Well, I don't know.

32:02.668 --> 32:04.548
- Busy tonight?
- No.

32:04.712 --> 32:05.712
No?

32:05.880 --> 32:09.240
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?

32:09.467 --> 32:11.067
Okay. About 7:00?

32:11.344 --> 32:13.144
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.

32:13.304 --> 32:16.384
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

32:16.933 --> 32:19.853
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.

32:20.062 --> 32:22.782
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.561
You found it, huh?

32:39.499 --> 32:40.859
Thanks to you.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.361
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.269
That looks great.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.433
You find something?

32:48.927 --> 32:52.567
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

32:52.806 --> 32:55.726
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

32:55.934 --> 32:57.414
Yeah, I knew it.

33:00.481 --> 33:02.321
Did you sign it?

33:03.818 --> 33:05.258
You didn't sign it.

33:05.737 --> 33:06.777
No.

33:11.325 --> 33:15.325
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.940
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.125
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

33:21.587 --> 33:23.947
<i>Daniel-san,
you no look answer Miyagi.</i>

33:25.007 --> 33:30.647
<i>Just like a bonsai live inside the tree,
answer live inside of you.</i>

33:32.056 --> 33:35.216
The only thing living inside me right now
is a lot of confusion.

33:35.435 --> 33:37.475
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

33:37.646 --> 33:41.086
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.

33:42.151 --> 33:43.511
A match to it?

33:45.196 --> 33:48.036
Then you watch confusion disappear
with the smoke.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.576
"442nd."

36:56.069 --> 36:57.669
What are you doing here?

36:58.364 --> 37:00.004
- Forget something.
- What?

37:00.490 --> 37:03.490
For shop. Bring good luck.

37:04.078 --> 37:06.798
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.

37:07.832 --> 37:09.632
<i>Daniel-san look good.</i>

37:09.834 --> 37:12.114
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.497
What doing?

37:14.673 --> 37:19.073
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I decided to take your advice.

37:19.345 --> 37:21.905
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

37:22.098 --> 37:23.578
I'm not entering the tournament.

37:23.725 --> 37:26.765
I want my karate and your karate
to mean something.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.738
<i>Good decision, Daniel-san.</i>

37:34.277 --> 37:37.157
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.

37:37.364 --> 37:41.004
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

37:41.244 --> 37:43.044
Just an elbow, a few feet.

37:43.955 --> 37:47.595
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

37:48.042 --> 37:50.002
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.

37:54.424 --> 37:56.104
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:56.260 --> 37:58.060
So, you all set to go?

38:00.097 --> 38:02.257
First I gotta tell you this.

38:05.395 --> 38:08.595
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

38:09.273 --> 38:11.473
What do you have, poison oak?

38:11.735 --> 38:13.135
A boyfriend.

38:13.404 --> 38:17.764
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.

38:18.075 --> 38:20.355
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

38:20.578 --> 38:25.378
We were both a little dumb about it,
but we've been talking on the phone.

38:25.666 --> 38:28.626
I don't know, we're gonna give it
another try when I go home.

38:28.837 --> 38:31.357
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

38:32.382 --> 38:34.862
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

38:35.135 --> 38:37.535
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.

38:37.721 --> 38:39.321
I did come on kind of strong.

38:39.557 --> 38:42.637
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.

38:42.851 --> 38:44.251
That sounds great.

38:45.479 --> 38:47.759
It's just that I've been here
for two months...

38:47.941 --> 38:51.141
...with absolutely nothing to do
and I haven't even met any friends.

38:51.361 --> 38:52.921
Meet your first friend.

38:53.071 --> 38:54.391
All right.

38:54.531 --> 38:55.971
Yeah, this is wild.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.956
Wait till he hears about this one.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.158
Who?

38:59.286 --> 39:02.526
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?

39:02.749 --> 39:03.829
Yeah, why not?

39:03.958 --> 39:06.158
You are about to meet the greatest guy.

39:06.335 --> 39:10.215
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.

39:10.465 --> 39:12.025
He's like no one you'll ever meet.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.415
On top of that,
he happens to be my best friend.

39:14.595 --> 39:15.915
Why do you call him "mister"?

39:16.054 --> 39:17.134
Mr. Miyagi.

39:17.765 --> 39:20.845
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.020
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

39:23.188 --> 39:24.988
- How do you do?
- Hi.

39:25.148 --> 39:28.028
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.

39:28.235 --> 39:31.035
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.

39:31.238 --> 39:32.878
How's it going so far? Good?

39:33.031 --> 39:36.991
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

39:37.620 --> 39:40.420
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

39:40.623 --> 39:43.063
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.370
No, I won't.

39:44.502 --> 39:47.382
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

39:47.588 --> 39:50.148
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

39:51.968 --> 39:54.728
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.

39:54.930 --> 39:56.770
He's the best. Come on in.

40:00.103 --> 40:01.183
What's this?

40:01.312 --> 40:04.512
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.773
What do you think?
It is going to be great.

40:06.943 --> 40:09.463
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...

40:09.654 --> 40:10.934
So where'd you meet him?

40:11.072 --> 40:14.232
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.

40:14.451 --> 40:15.651
Karate?

40:15.870 --> 40:17.630
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

40:18.539 --> 40:20.939
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.805
He doesn't act like it either.

40:22.961 --> 40:25.721
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.

40:25.922 --> 40:27.002
What do you mean?

40:27.131 --> 40:29.571
It's like that vase
you were making this morning.

40:29.759 --> 40:32.039
He'll make a whole karate lesson
out of that.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.700
No, I'm not kidding.

40:33.847 --> 40:36.367
Show me how you were making that...

40:36.558 --> 40:39.638
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.295
Okay, go up.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.586
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.096
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.838
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

40:50.032 --> 40:51.992
Then pull down and bring your knee up.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.559
Room for one more down there?

40:54.703 --> 40:56.463
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.142
I meant for business, pal.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.770
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.

41:02.003 --> 41:04.563
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year.

41:04.755 --> 41:06.595
Is that true, Daniel?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.520
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

41:08.677 --> 41:10.237
Yeah, that's true. So what?

41:10.387 --> 41:13.907
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?

41:14.140 --> 41:18.020
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.

41:18.271 --> 41:20.591
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

41:20.773 --> 41:23.173
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future.

41:23.359 --> 41:25.159
I won't let that happen. Get it?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.680
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.

41:27.864 --> 41:30.544
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.

41:30.742 --> 41:32.462
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...

41:32.619 --> 41:33.499
Sign it!

41:38.710 --> 41:40.150
You sign it, man!

41:40.294 --> 41:42.574
Come on, man! Right now!

41:42.839 --> 41:43.879
Let's go, punk!

41:44.006 --> 41:46.886
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

41:47.135 --> 41:49.735
Yeah, you sleep on it.

41:50.180 --> 41:53.300
And you can dream about me.

41:54.143 --> 41:55.303
You slimeball.

41:55.435 --> 41:59.035
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?

41:59.315 --> 42:00.795
Come on, Mike.

42:01.568 --> 42:05.328
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.

42:05.906 --> 42:07.106
See you later.

42:08.617 --> 42:10.377
Do you know those creeps?

42:11.036 --> 42:12.076
No.

42:12.495 --> 42:14.855
And I wanna keep it that way.

42:37.981 --> 42:39.301
Excuse me.

42:39.734 --> 42:41.094
Mr. Miyagi?

42:43.446 --> 42:45.286
My name is Terry Silver.

42:45.490 --> 42:48.050
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

42:48.243 --> 42:50.483
My teacher sends his respects.

42:53.541 --> 42:57.501
<i>John Kreese of the Cobra Kai dojo
was our school's number one student.</i>

42:58.337 --> 43:00.577
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago...

43:00.756 --> 43:03.116
...about what happened last year
at the tournament.

43:03.301 --> 43:07.101
My teacher sends his apologies
for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.

43:10.643 --> 43:12.163
Accept apology.

43:13.771 --> 43:16.451
I was sent here
to help John regain balance.

43:17.441 --> 43:19.521
Hope you can be successful.

43:19.985 --> 43:22.385
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

43:23.406 --> 43:25.366
I buried John last week.

43:27.786 --> 43:29.306
He's dead? What happened?

43:29.455 --> 43:32.975
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest,
but I knew John better than anyone.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.608
Karate was his life.

43:34.752 --> 43:38.432
And after he lost all his students,
it just broke his heart.

43:39.089 --> 43:42.529
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

43:43.135 --> 43:45.295
He saved my life in Vietnam.

43:46.431 --> 43:48.591
War does something to a man.

43:50.852 --> 43:53.372
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

43:53.564 --> 43:54.884
Have been.

43:56.150 --> 43:57.510
Do know.

43:58.485 --> 43:59.805
442nd?

44:01.948 --> 44:03.028
Man!

44:03.491 --> 44:05.811
More medals of honour
came out of the 442nd...

44:05.994 --> 44:08.274
...than all World War II put together.

44:08.455 --> 44:10.415
I bet you've been there.

44:11.375 --> 44:13.655
Is this your student? The champion?

44:14.002 --> 44:15.082
Yeah.

44:15.212 --> 44:17.252
Our apologies to you, too.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.560
John had vowed
to come and apologise himself.

44:22.011 --> 44:23.331
He planned...

44:27.058 --> 44:30.178
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.

44:31.730 --> 44:33.370
Mr. Silver...

44:35.317 --> 44:37.877
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.

44:39.030 --> 44:40.470
Me, too.

44:42.075 --> 44:43.395
Thank you.

44:50.875 --> 44:52.635
God, that's too bad.

44:54.088 --> 44:55.848
<i>Too bad, Daniel-san.</i>

44:56.757 --> 44:58.677
<i>Come, we continue kata.</i>

45:13.192 --> 45:14.192
Hello?

45:15.152 --> 45:16.872
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

45:17.029 --> 45:20.189
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.

45:20.407 --> 45:25.087
She had to do some things, so I got stuck
with all this macaroni and cheese.

45:25.371 --> 45:28.411
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

45:28.625 --> 45:30.545
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.

45:30.711 --> 45:33.391
I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

45:33.589 --> 45:35.629
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

45:35.799 --> 45:37.959
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.789
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

45:40.972 --> 45:41.892
Okay.

45:45.769 --> 45:48.809
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...

45:50.316 --> 45:51.396
...eleven.

45:51.775 --> 45:53.575
Let's eat. I'm starved.

45:53.944 --> 45:55.744
I hope you like this.

45:56.072 --> 45:59.152
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted, but...

46:00.410 --> 46:02.250
Hey, this came out great.

46:02.495 --> 46:04.935
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.

46:05.123 --> 46:08.163
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?

46:08.376 --> 46:10.296
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.

46:10.463 --> 46:12.783
- I have something for you.
- For me?

46:14.424 --> 46:15.864
What is this?

46:17.595 --> 46:19.315
The Down Stairs? What is that?

46:19.471 --> 46:22.511
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.

46:22.725 --> 46:25.285
It's for the night before you go back home.

46:25.478 --> 46:28.158
I figured it would be
a nice going-away present.

46:28.398 --> 46:30.598
Daniel, that is so sweet.

46:33.153 --> 46:36.473
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.

46:36.699 --> 46:39.779
Danny, I hope you got some good news
for my friend Mike here.

46:39.995 --> 46:41.675
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.

46:41.829 --> 46:44.429
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?

46:44.624 --> 46:46.504
You haven't signed the application yet.

46:46.669 --> 46:49.069
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.

46:49.254 --> 46:51.014
Take your friends and get out of here.

46:51.173 --> 46:53.213
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.

46:59.099 --> 47:01.659
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.

47:01.851 --> 47:04.531
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.

47:04.729 --> 47:07.329
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

47:07.524 --> 47:09.084
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

47:09.234 --> 47:11.954
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

47:12.196 --> 47:13.836
Come on!

47:23.333 --> 47:25.613
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!

47:25.794 --> 47:27.274
Nice kick. Not bad.

47:27.421 --> 47:29.541
Better. Good, but not good enough.

47:33.052 --> 47:34.612
Come on, get up!

47:35.262 --> 47:37.182
Why are you being so stubborn?

47:38.099 --> 47:39.259
Don't do that!

47:42.729 --> 47:46.369
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.

47:47.275 --> 47:48.595
Stop it!

47:50.904 --> 47:52.144
It's your ass!

47:52.698 --> 47:54.218
Just get out of here!

47:54.992 --> 47:57.592
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!

47:57.787 --> 48:00.027
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!

48:01.332 --> 48:02.772
Come on, old man!

48:06.379 --> 48:07.899
Mike, let's go!

48:09.424 --> 48:11.144
Let's go! You wimp!

48:14.055 --> 48:16.415
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.

48:16.599 --> 48:18.479
You're finished!

48:18.726 --> 48:20.966
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.

48:30.947 --> 48:32.867
<i>So, Daniel-san, time take Jessica home.</i>

48:33.034 --> 48:34.634
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

48:34.786 --> 48:36.826
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.544
I can't believe you're singing.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.016
Forget it.

48:58.311 --> 48:59.791
<i>Feel lucky, Daniel-san.</i>

48:59.938 --> 49:01.898
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?

49:02.065 --> 49:05.545
<i>Feel lucky. Bonsai tree not in shop.
Safe at home.</i>

49:05.986 --> 49:09.026
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.

49:09.239 --> 49:11.719
<i>Daniel-san, we can rebuild the shop.</i>

49:12.117 --> 49:13.877
Cannot rebuild stock.

49:16.414 --> 49:20.734
<i>We sell a few trees, fix shoji screen,
start over again.</i>

49:21.878 --> 49:25.118
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?

49:25.340 --> 49:27.660
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

49:27.843 --> 49:30.443
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

49:35.309 --> 49:36.709
Sing happy song.

49:54.664 --> 49:57.264
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

50:00.587 --> 50:01.987
They stole them!

50:03.256 --> 50:06.136
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?

50:06.343 --> 50:09.943
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?

50:10.180 --> 50:13.060
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.

50:13.267 --> 50:14.547
What?

50:15.395 --> 50:16.995
Sometimes I don't get you.

50:17.146 --> 50:20.546
The shop's wrecked. We've just been
robbed, and you're going fishing.

50:20.776 --> 50:22.736
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.

50:22.903 --> 50:25.983
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?

50:26.198 --> 50:31.158
<i>Daniel-san, sometime better be bothered
on full stomach than empty one.</i>

50:31.745 --> 50:35.065
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

50:35.291 --> 50:38.771
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.

50:39.003 --> 50:41.763
Show them the application
so they can arrest these jerks.

50:41.965 --> 50:44.925
This is the '80s,
you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.

50:45.135 --> 50:47.335
You can't be so damn passive.

50:48.096 --> 50:50.936
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

51:07.368 --> 51:10.008
I bring the tournament application
to the police station.

51:10.204 --> 51:12.044
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.

51:12.206 --> 51:14.846
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."

51:15.042 --> 51:16.522
We'll see. I hope.

51:17.962 --> 51:21.362
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi
before going after his tree.

51:21.591 --> 51:24.231
He wouldn't have hidden it
in the middle of nowhere...

51:24.427 --> 51:27.387
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.

51:27.598 --> 51:29.918
If he doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for...

51:30.100 --> 51:31.780
...he loses his business. He's broke.

51:31.936 --> 51:34.976
His social security can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat.

51:35.189 --> 51:37.349
This tree is like money in the bank.

51:37.525 --> 51:39.685
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.

51:46.535 --> 51:48.895
How much do you think
this thing is worth?

51:49.079 --> 51:53.479
<i>I found out these original bonsai trees
start at $10,000.</i>

51:53.751 --> 51:56.751
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.

51:57.005 --> 52:01.485
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.

52:04.679 --> 52:06.439
It's a long way down there.

52:07.975 --> 52:10.415
- You know what I think?
- What?

52:10.603 --> 52:15.483
I think when the tide comes in,
the ocean fills up the bottom down there.

52:15.942 --> 52:18.182
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

52:18.361 --> 52:20.041
Yeah, no kidding.

52:20.864 --> 52:24.264
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

52:24.492 --> 52:28.172
He told me he put it halfway down
the steepest cliff...

52:28.413 --> 52:30.853
...where it would catch
the first rays of the sun.

52:31.042 --> 52:32.882
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.

52:33.044 --> 52:35.564
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?

52:35.755 --> 52:38.595
<i>God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my gi.</i>

52:38.800 --> 52:40.280
Come on, let me see.

52:40.427 --> 52:43.107
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...

52:43.305 --> 52:45.585
It's just like the one on the pot I made.

52:45.766 --> 52:47.886
How are we going to get
all the way down there?

52:48.060 --> 52:52.180
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.

52:54.401 --> 52:57.841
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.

52:58.071 --> 53:01.871
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.560
Okay. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

53:08.040 --> 53:09.360
I wanna do this?

53:09.625 --> 53:12.945
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.

53:13.171 --> 53:16.011
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.

53:16.216 --> 53:18.416
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.

53:18.593 --> 53:21.833
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

53:22.097 --> 53:24.657
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.

53:26.768 --> 53:29.528
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.

53:29.730 --> 53:32.290
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.

53:33.192 --> 53:34.392
This is almost fun.

53:34.527 --> 53:37.327
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.

53:37.530 --> 53:39.850
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

53:40.033 --> 53:41.193
Thanks.

53:41.368 --> 53:43.888
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?

53:44.079 --> 53:47.839
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

53:48.084 --> 53:50.684
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.

53:50.920 --> 53:54.200
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

53:54.423 --> 53:58.343
Put your feet against the rocks
and push out. I got you.

53:58.970 --> 54:02.850
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.

54:03.141 --> 54:06.301
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.480
To the brake. Right here. All right?

54:10.441 --> 54:13.641
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.

54:13.861 --> 54:16.821
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

54:17.032 --> 54:19.672
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

54:19.867 --> 54:24.347
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.

54:25.666 --> 54:26.746
Great!

54:26.875 --> 54:28.995
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?

54:29.211 --> 54:31.331
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.

54:31.505 --> 54:35.385
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.

54:35.968 --> 54:38.128
All right. God, you scared me.

54:38.304 --> 54:39.744
I scared you?

54:40.432 --> 54:43.032
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

54:43.227 --> 54:46.147
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

54:46.355 --> 54:48.875
You're right. I got enough to worry about.

54:51.402 --> 54:53.722
- What?
- Where's the tree?

54:53.905 --> 54:56.305
It's right there, between the two ropes.

54:56.782 --> 54:58.062
Come on.

55:09.630 --> 55:11.310
It's a beautiful tree.

55:14.552 --> 55:18.192
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

55:18.431 --> 55:19.831
Yeah, no kidding.

55:19.974 --> 55:21.934
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.

55:22.102 --> 55:24.302
Take the rope
and you put it around your butt.

55:24.480 --> 55:26.720
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

55:26.899 --> 55:29.779
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.

55:30.027 --> 55:32.587
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

55:33.656 --> 55:34.976
All right.

55:40.038 --> 55:42.398
So he really planted this here, huh?

55:42.583 --> 55:46.143
What, this tree? He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

55:47.713 --> 55:51.113
What if he tells you to put it back?

55:51.717 --> 55:53.037
What if he does?

55:53.219 --> 55:56.579
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

55:56.806 --> 55:58.606
<i>That bonsai shop
was his dream come true.</i>

55:58.767 --> 56:02.407
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

56:02.646 --> 56:06.486
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

56:06.734 --> 56:09.174
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

56:09.362 --> 56:13.082
The tree will be fine. The most important
thing is to pack the roots well.

56:13.366 --> 56:16.286
Believe me, he's taught me everything
about these trees.

56:16.494 --> 56:19.374
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.

56:19.581 --> 56:21.981
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.

56:22.167 --> 56:24.167
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!

56:24.336 --> 56:27.056
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

56:27.256 --> 56:28.576
I got it!

56:28.800 --> 56:31.760
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!

56:33.847 --> 56:35.887
It's gonna get washed out!

56:36.057 --> 56:37.697
Move! Hurry up!

56:38.017 --> 56:39.737
Get out of the way!

56:40.353 --> 56:42.713
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

56:42.898 --> 56:45.578
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

56:46.026 --> 56:49.026
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!

56:49.239 --> 56:51.799
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.

56:51.991 --> 56:54.831
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.

56:55.036 --> 56:57.916
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!

56:58.123 --> 57:00.123
Wash the roots off. Be careful.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.260
All right, let me have it.

57:02.461 --> 57:04.901
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.569
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.318
No big breaks. We're in good shape.

57:09.469 --> 57:11.589
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.

57:11.763 --> 57:12.763
Look, it was my idea to...

57:14.766 --> 57:15.926
The ropes.

57:18.645 --> 57:21.245
LaRusso! How you doing?

57:21.523 --> 57:22.963
Heads up, Danny-boy.

57:23.108 --> 57:24.708
Here's something you forgot.

57:24.860 --> 57:26.940
How'd they get here?

57:28.322 --> 57:30.802
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.

57:31.116 --> 57:32.556
So let the ropes down.

57:32.702 --> 57:32.902
First sign the application.

57:32.952 --> 57:34.832
First sign the application.

57:35.205 --> 57:36.725
Screw you, man!

57:37.457 --> 57:39.817
See, I think you got it backwards,
buddy-boy.

57:40.002 --> 57:42.202
I'm not the one who's screwed here.

57:42.588 --> 57:46.508
Now I figure the tide's gonna come
in about 12 minutes.

57:47.677 --> 57:49.237
Hope you brought a life raft.

57:49.387 --> 57:51.827
How do we get out of here without a rope?

57:52.264 --> 57:56.224
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

57:56.478 --> 58:00.598
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.

58:00.857 --> 58:03.457
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then.

58:03.652 --> 58:05.972
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.

58:06.155 --> 58:07.475
I hate this guy.

58:08.157 --> 58:09.797
Here. I signed it.

58:09.950 --> 58:12.550
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

58:13.079 --> 58:15.239
All right! We'll send them down.

58:16.583 --> 58:17.783
Let them go.

58:20.254 --> 58:21.734
I never learn.

58:21.964 --> 58:25.244
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

58:25.467 --> 58:27.667
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

58:27.845 --> 58:29.605
You didn't know this would happen.

58:29.764 --> 58:31.684
With this guy, I should have known.

58:31.849 --> 58:34.089
I should have known with that guy.

58:34.269 --> 58:37.149
I should have just signed the damn thing.

58:37.356 --> 58:39.916
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

58:40.108 --> 58:43.548
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

58:43.945 --> 58:45.425
Come on, pull!

59:02.133 --> 59:03.893
All right, I got you.

59:09.516 --> 59:11.756
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

59:13.353 --> 59:15.553
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!

59:15.730 --> 59:17.970
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.

59:18.192 --> 59:20.192
Leave him there. Get the application.

59:20.360 --> 59:23.000
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

59:25.575 --> 59:27.375
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

59:27.534 --> 59:29.174
All right, here. Just hold us.

59:29.329 --> 59:31.009
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

59:33.625 --> 59:35.065
Check it out.

59:36.086 --> 59:37.406
It's cool.

59:37.713 --> 59:38.873
That's it.

59:39.048 --> 59:41.528
Don't even think about backing out, man...

59:41.717 --> 59:43.517
...because then I'll really be pissed.

59:43.677 --> 59:46.197
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory...

59:46.389 --> 59:48.269
...compared to what I'd do to you.

59:48.433 --> 59:50.273
And what we'd all do to her.

59:50.477 --> 59:51.917
Now you're talking.

59:53.729 --> 59:55.969
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!

59:56.399 --> 59:57.599
What, Tarzan?

59:57.901 --> 59:59.021
Pull us up!

59:59.361 --> 01:00:01.801
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.

01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:03.789
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

01:00:03.949 --> 01:00:05.909
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!

01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:07.796
- No!
- Shut up!

01:00:08.454 --> 01:00:09.774
All right.

01:00:11.249 --> 01:00:13.129
Just hold us. Don't let go.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:18.852
Here. Now please be careful with it.

01:00:19.258 --> 01:00:20.858
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:24.210
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.350
- No!
- No, don't, please.

01:00:26.515 --> 01:00:28.915
All right, enough. Give me it.

01:00:29.102 --> 01:00:31.182
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.

01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:33.194
Be careful with it, please.

01:00:33.357 --> 01:00:34.597
Daniel...

01:00:35.483 --> 01:00:37.003
...make a wish.

01:00:37.318 --> 01:00:38.358
No!

01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:55.655
Mr. Miyagi?

01:00:59.134 --> 01:01:00.214
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

01:01:00.844 --> 01:01:02.604
The trunk's split. See?

01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:07.542
I put the roots in peat moss,
but they got salt water on them...

01:01:07.977 --> 01:01:09.097
...and I washed it.

01:01:09.228 --> 01:01:12.268
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

01:01:12.482 --> 01:01:13.482
I'm sorry.

01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:15.809
I just figured maybe we could sell it...

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:17.506
...so we wouldn't have to close.

01:01:17.655 --> 01:01:20.455
I didn't want it to be my fault
your dream didn't come true.

01:01:20.658 --> 01:01:22.378
Whoever bought it would take good care.

01:01:22.534 --> 01:01:24.014
Even better care than yourself.

01:01:24.161 --> 01:01:26.441
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

01:01:26.622 --> 01:01:29.542
How can someone take care of it
better than where you left it?

01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:32.391
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.

01:01:32.587 --> 01:01:36.347
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.

01:01:36.633 --> 01:01:38.713
You do? I'm such an idiot.

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:42.102
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.

01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:44.671
If roots strong, tree survive.

01:01:44.975 --> 01:01:46.895
<i>Where do you want these bonsai trees?</i>

01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:49.021
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.

01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.109
- Trees?
- Peat moss.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:53.794
Trees? What? What did you do?

01:01:53.985 --> 01:01:55.865
Did you buy these?

01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:57.641
With what?

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.850
Sell truck.

01:02:00.409 --> 01:02:02.089
You sold the truck?

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:08.493
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.710
I wake up this morning, you gone.

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.662
Damn it!

01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:14.517
Why am I so stupid?

01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:17.601
<i>No worry, Daniel-san.</i>

01:02:18.178 --> 01:02:21.378
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

01:02:21.598 --> 01:02:24.318
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

01:02:32.486 --> 01:02:33.526
Why?

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:36.253
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

01:02:36.447 --> 01:02:38.127
I don't always have the right answers.

01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:40.443
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.

01:02:40.619 --> 01:02:41.899
I made a decision on the spot.

01:02:42.037 --> 01:02:45.157
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

01:02:45.374 --> 01:02:46.734
Understand.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.490
You do?

01:02:50.088 --> 01:02:52.288
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

01:02:52.465 --> 01:02:55.305
I don't stand a chance against this guy
unless you train me.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:56.510
Understand.

01:02:56.637 --> 01:02:59.037
Well then, you'll train me, right?

01:03:00.557 --> 01:03:03.077
<i>Daniel-san, Miyagi always train you.</i>

01:03:04.854 --> 01:03:07.014
But for tournament, cannot.

01:03:09.401 --> 01:03:10.641
Cannot?

01:03:11.737 --> 01:03:13.817
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

01:03:13.988 --> 01:03:16.348
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.209
You know what the worst thing was:

01:03:28.379 --> 01:03:31.219
When he told me he wouldn't train me
for the tournament.

01:03:31.424 --> 01:03:33.464
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:35.875
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

01:03:36.054 --> 01:03:38.214
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:41.470
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:43.765
So bonehead can knock more out of me?

01:03:43.938 --> 01:03:46.138
You gotta have more confidence.

01:03:46.316 --> 01:03:49.756
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

01:03:53.782 --> 01:03:55.262
Jessica, this is...

01:03:55.617 --> 01:03:56.737
Hi, there.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.790
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

01:03:58.954 --> 01:04:00.954
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.

01:04:01.123 --> 01:04:03.803
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.

01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:06.241
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:07.461
The All Valley.

01:04:07.588 --> 01:04:10.428
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

01:04:10.633 --> 01:04:12.713
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:15.006
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

01:04:15.388 --> 01:04:16.668
- Not really.
- Learn.

01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:19.447
Most tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

01:04:19.643 --> 01:04:22.963
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

01:04:23.189 --> 01:04:25.869
I'm kind of training for this one myself.

01:04:26.776 --> 01:04:28.296
That's too bad.

01:04:28.444 --> 01:04:31.844
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.

01:04:32.073 --> 01:04:33.193
Great.

01:04:33.366 --> 01:04:36.086
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.

01:04:36.287 --> 01:04:38.327
All right, I will. 'Bye.

01:04:39.915 --> 01:04:43.075
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?

01:04:43.294 --> 01:04:45.054
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.

01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:48.132
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.

01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:50.941
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.

01:04:51.136 --> 01:04:52.536
Oh, man.

01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:02.018
Get out of here! I signed it!

01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:04.709
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.181
You have no proof.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.799
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.220
It's your ass, man!

01:05:15.204 --> 01:05:17.364
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.300
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:22.751
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.

01:05:25.673 --> 01:05:27.193
Get up! Get up!

01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:30.588
You see this? You see it?

01:05:33.556 --> 01:05:35.636
Get your hands off me!

01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:38.329
If I see you even on the same street
as this kid...

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.560
...I won't be so charitable with your health.

01:05:40.731 --> 01:05:42.891
- Understand?
- Yes!

01:05:43.484 --> 01:05:46.004
Get the hell out of here.

01:05:46.278 --> 01:05:47.478
Who is that guy?

01:05:47.613 --> 01:05:50.133
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

01:05:50.324 --> 01:05:53.604
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:55.669
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.

01:05:55.831 --> 01:05:58.191
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.855
Right. Thanks.

01:06:00.002 --> 01:06:02.402
There's only so much
you can learn from a book.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:04.028
You're telling me.

01:06:04.298 --> 01:06:07.098
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

01:06:07.302 --> 01:06:10.902
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.520
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

01:06:14.726 --> 01:06:18.646
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.

01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:21.731
Better.

01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:24.659
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

01:06:25.154 --> 01:06:26.834
Keep your hand up.

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.570
Are you okay?

01:06:31.745 --> 01:06:34.105
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.

01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:36.089
That's a strong move.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.752
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.

01:06:38.919 --> 01:06:42.279
<i>I'm opening the Cobra Kai dojo again.
It's time to set things straight.</i>

01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:46.426
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

01:06:46.677 --> 01:06:51.237
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.

01:06:52.518 --> 01:06:54.918
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:56.503
I'll see you.

01:06:59.692 --> 01:07:01.132
Thanks again.

01:07:13.749 --> 01:07:15.429
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:16.943
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

01:07:17.586 --> 01:07:20.186
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:26.979
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.

01:07:27.263 --> 01:07:31.063
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:34.029
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

01:07:34.646 --> 01:07:35.926
Of course.

01:07:36.064 --> 01:07:38.864
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.

01:07:39.067 --> 01:07:40.987
I don't want you to train me. One thing.

01:07:41.154 --> 01:07:44.154
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

01:07:44.365 --> 01:07:48.205
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.

01:07:48.452 --> 01:07:50.732
You wait here. I be right back.

01:07:51.582 --> 01:07:52.902
Where you going?

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:55.062
Just wait here.

01:07:56.128 --> 01:07:59.248
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.

01:07:59.465 --> 01:08:03.185
I found out from this guy, tournament guys
are suckers for front sweeps.

01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:05.627
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

01:08:05.805 --> 01:08:09.725
<i>Daniel-san, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...</i>

01:08:10.101 --> 01:08:11.541
It's no joke, all right?

01:08:11.687 --> 01:08:14.247
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:17.081
Just don't make fun of me, all right?

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:21.727
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:13.037
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.

01:09:13.211 --> 01:09:14.930
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:09:15.089 --> 01:09:18.809
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.

01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:20.011
And?

01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:22.975
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.461
I mean,
you know, just on a short-term basis.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.441
Trouble, are you kidding?
lt'd be an honour.

01:09:28.645 --> 01:09:31.085
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?

01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:34.371
Well, Mr. Miyagi...

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.457
...doesn't need to know about it, if...

01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:43.296
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:45.254
He just doesn't approve.

01:09:47.624 --> 01:09:49.944
Everybody has a right to his opinion.

01:09:50.126 --> 01:09:52.926
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.130
So, when do you want to start?

01:09:55.298 --> 01:09:58.178
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

01:09:58.386 --> 01:10:00.986
<i>I got a gi hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.</i>

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.260
What do you say we go right now?

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:04.513
Now?

01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:06.309
One more.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.160
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:13.557
You're better than I thought.

01:10:13.902 --> 01:10:16.462
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.

01:10:16.655 --> 01:10:18.335
You're ready to move on.

01:10:18.491 --> 01:10:20.971
There are three things
that make a champion.

01:10:21.161 --> 01:10:25.401
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.

01:10:25.748 --> 01:10:27.428
The first two I can't give you.

01:10:27.584 --> 01:10:30.504
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

01:10:30.712 --> 01:10:32.472
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

01:10:33.173 --> 01:10:34.413
Sure.

01:10:35.593 --> 01:10:37.953
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."

01:10:38.137 --> 01:10:41.377
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.

01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:45.998
Now, over the years I've developed
a system of intensive short-term training...

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:48.190
...for situations just like this.

01:10:48.357 --> 01:10:50.517
It comes in two parts and has three rules.

01:10:50.693 --> 01:10:53.373
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.260
You like that, huh?

01:10:57.032 --> 01:10:58.592
Rule Number One:

01:10:58.743 --> 01:11:01.183
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

01:11:02.246 --> 01:11:03.566
Repeat it.

01:11:04.124 --> 01:11:05.844
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.080
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

01:11:08.462 --> 01:11:12.102
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.

01:11:13.091 --> 01:11:16.891
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.

01:11:19.265 --> 01:11:20.945
What are you...

01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:33.632
That's too low.

01:11:34.614 --> 01:11:37.734
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.000
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

01:11:49.923 --> 01:11:52.443
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.

01:11:53.301 --> 01:11:56.461
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.

01:11:57.932 --> 01:11:59.612
That's it. Harder.

01:12:01.227 --> 01:12:02.427
Harder.

01:12:07.943 --> 01:12:10.943
<i>"Ow" is not an acceptable kiai in this dojo,
Mr. LaRusso.</i>

01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:14.674
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

01:12:15.784 --> 01:12:18.944
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.240
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

01:12:43.397 --> 01:12:45.477
You did good for your first day.

01:12:47.903 --> 01:12:49.103
Thanks.

01:12:56.579 --> 01:12:58.459
I really appreciate all your help.

01:12:58.623 --> 01:13:00.663
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.681
Who is it?

01:13:44.172 --> 01:13:46.132
Why don't you come in?

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.870
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.

01:13:51.137 --> 01:13:54.137
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

01:13:54.433 --> 01:13:56.873
What happened foot?

01:13:59.021 --> 01:14:00.341
What foot?

01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:05.581
Look at that!

01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:07.888
I don't know.

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:11.375
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.

01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:15.299
- What's that?
- You soak foot.

01:14:15.539 --> 01:14:17.259
Be better tomorrow.

01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:22.376
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.

01:14:26.718 --> 01:14:29.318
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

01:14:29.554 --> 01:14:33.034
Better you don't know. Give me foot.

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:41.098
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...

01:14:42.485 --> 01:14:43.725
Good.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:49.681
Maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:51.430
Then you tell Miyagi.

01:14:51.579 --> 01:14:53.859
Tomorrow? No.

01:14:54.039 --> 01:14:57.919
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.

01:14:59.879 --> 01:15:03.999
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...

01:15:04.258 --> 01:15:07.938
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with
a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:11.180
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.

01:15:16.731 --> 01:15:18.331
What am I doing?

01:15:21.194 --> 01:15:22.794
What am I doing?

01:15:54.397 --> 01:15:56.877
Hope confusion end soon.

01:16:00.153 --> 01:16:02.913
Miyagi heart empty without you.

01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:12.788
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.

01:16:14.126 --> 01:16:15.686
All right, let's go.

01:16:16.504 --> 01:16:19.224
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

01:16:19.466 --> 01:16:21.746
- No.
- I didn't think so.

01:16:21.926 --> 01:16:25.086
<i>- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did kata.</i>

01:16:25.305 --> 01:16:27.025
<i>- Kata?
- Yeah.</i>

01:16:27.224 --> 01:16:30.504
<i>Kata is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.</i>

01:16:30.727 --> 01:16:32.767
Come on over here. Hold the bag.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.900
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method:

01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.630
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.

01:16:39.111 --> 01:16:41.191
Now, imagine this is the enemy.

01:16:41.406 --> 01:16:44.206
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:50.130
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:51.933
Good. You try it.

01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:57.286
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.

01:16:57.507 --> 01:16:59.707
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

01:16:59.926 --> 01:17:01.366
Lay into him.

01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:10.871
Why do I have to do this with this thing?

01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:14.431
Because it's part of the training.

01:17:14.733 --> 01:17:17.293
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

01:17:17.486 --> 01:17:19.846
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:22.911
What, do you think you can rely
on that crane crap?

01:17:23.159 --> 01:17:25.439
I did pretty well with it last time.

01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:30.268
Wake up and smell the coffee.

01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:33.236
Last time you weren't fighting this.

01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:38.716
You don't get it, do you?

01:17:40.595 --> 01:17:44.635
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.

01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:47.611
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

01:17:47.811 --> 01:17:49.811
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

01:19:23.164 --> 01:19:24.284
Yeah?

01:19:27.627 --> 01:19:30.267
Damn it! Can you come back later?

01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:32.704
Why are you doing this to yourself?

01:19:32.925 --> 01:19:34.045
Doing what?

01:19:34.384 --> 01:19:36.064
What you doing.

01:19:37.054 --> 01:19:38.254
Because...

01:19:39.933 --> 01:19:43.413
...extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

01:19:45.438 --> 01:19:47.758
That not sound like you talking.

01:19:49.527 --> 01:19:51.407
It is me talking, all right?

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:54.574
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I got problems...

01:19:54.782 --> 01:19:58.182
...and if you won't be part of the solution,
don't give me a hard time.

01:19:58.411 --> 01:19:59.971
Okay? You got it?

01:20:32.948 --> 01:20:35.588
<i>What are you wasting your time
with kata for?</i>

01:20:35.827 --> 01:20:38.427
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament?

01:20:38.621 --> 01:20:41.341
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.958
All right. Come over here.

01:20:44.127 --> 01:20:48.007
Let's get back to learning something
that can do some real damage.

01:20:48.715 --> 01:20:50.315
Rule Number Three:

01:20:50.551 --> 01:20:52.871
A man can't see, he can't fight.

01:20:53.804 --> 01:20:55.604
If you hit him square in the nose...

01:20:55.765 --> 01:20:59.165
...he'll be blinded by his tears
and choke on his own blood.

01:20:59.602 --> 01:21:01.042
Here's how it works.

01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:04.989
You wait until your man is attacking
and when he's close enough...

01:21:05.942 --> 01:21:08.982
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

01:21:09.238 --> 01:21:12.158
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.207
He can't continue. That means you win.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.045
- You like that?
- I like that.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.807
Good. Give it a shot.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.280
Let's try it over here on your friend.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.197
Reverse punch.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.250
Visualise.

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.671
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:39.731
This is a living fighting machine
that wants to detach...

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.738
...your head from the rest of your body!

01:21:47.988 --> 01:21:50.028
It's blood. So what?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.480
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:58.990
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?

01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:01.412
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.

01:22:05.924 --> 01:22:08.044
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

01:22:08.718 --> 01:22:09.998
You nailed him!

01:22:11.054 --> 01:22:14.014
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!

01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:18.778
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.860
You met him. We were jogging
and he pulled up in the car.

01:22:22.066 --> 01:22:23.786
I know who you are talking about.

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:26.664
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.

01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:29.984
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.

01:22:30.201 --> 01:22:32.601
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.

01:22:32.786 --> 01:22:35.666
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.

01:22:35.873 --> 01:22:37.473
What are you looking at?

01:22:37.626 --> 01:22:40.226
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.940
I don't play that.

01:22:42.088 --> 01:22:43.928
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

01:22:44.091 --> 01:22:45.731
What about you?

01:22:45.926 --> 01:22:48.486
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

01:23:26.303 --> 01:23:28.623
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.

01:23:28.806 --> 01:23:30.806
Tell me. I could drink a horse.

01:23:31.017 --> 01:23:34.617
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?

01:23:34.854 --> 01:23:37.174
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?

01:23:37.357 --> 01:23:40.477
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.

01:23:40.694 --> 01:23:42.534
- Says who?
- Says me.

01:23:43.321 --> 01:23:45.001
I'm taking her home.

01:23:48.202 --> 01:23:51.562
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

01:23:51.789 --> 01:23:53.149
What, are you nuts?

01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:56.172
Come on. We gotta get out of here!

01:23:56.418 --> 01:23:57.778
Up you go.

01:23:57.962 --> 01:24:00.962
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

01:24:01.174 --> 01:24:03.134
Where's that guy with my money?

01:24:03.301 --> 01:24:05.581
Get out of the way!

01:24:06.889 --> 01:24:09.849
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:12.139
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

01:24:12.311 --> 01:24:13.791
I gotta go back in there.

01:24:13.938 --> 01:24:16.698
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.

01:24:16.942 --> 01:24:19.502
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:21.934
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

01:24:22.113 --> 01:24:25.433
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.

01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:32.111
Who is it?

01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:34.091
It's me, it's Daniel.

01:24:40.467 --> 01:24:41.507
What do you want?

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.276
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

01:24:43.429 --> 01:24:45.589
Just give me a minute. Please.

01:24:50.936 --> 01:24:53.816
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:56.743
You should tell that to the guy
whose nose you broke.

01:24:56.943 --> 01:24:58.823
I am. I will.

01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:01.679
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

01:25:01.865 --> 01:25:03.265
It wasn't you?

01:25:03.534 --> 01:25:05.934
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?

01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:09.121
I've been trying to be someone I'm not
and it's not working.

01:25:09.332 --> 01:25:12.092
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.

01:25:12.501 --> 01:25:15.661
The only thing I see you losing control of
is your temper.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.560
Well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

01:25:18.758 --> 01:25:20.838
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:23.331
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.

01:25:23.513 --> 01:25:27.313
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

01:25:27.643 --> 01:25:30.163
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

01:25:41.616 --> 01:25:43.576
Nobody's written you off.

01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:48.681
Just because I got upset
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:53.170
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

01:25:53.421 --> 01:25:57.261
Let's see how much faith he has
when he hears about what I did tonight.

01:25:57.551 --> 01:26:01.911
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.820
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

01:26:05.017 --> 01:26:09.777
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.

01:26:15.611 --> 01:26:17.291
You'll do fine.

01:26:17.947 --> 01:26:20.507
You just gotta do it.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:26.138
Well, I don't know if I can.

01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.430
I'm gonna miss you.

01:26:38.303 --> 01:26:40.663
Send me a Christmas card, okay?

01:26:41.472 --> 01:26:43.472
You got a deal.

01:26:44.351 --> 01:26:45.951
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

01:26:51.985 --> 01:26:53.105
Thanks.

01:26:53.819 --> 01:26:55.059
Anytime.

01:26:59.326 --> 01:27:02.486
I just told the other nurse
that I don't know his name.

01:27:02.746 --> 01:27:05.306
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.

01:27:05.499 --> 01:27:08.299
I need to tell him I'm sorry
and that I want to pay for it.

01:27:08.502 --> 01:27:11.182
Please, let me speak with him.

01:27:12.465 --> 01:27:16.825
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!

01:27:17.137 --> 01:27:20.937
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...

01:27:21.641 --> 01:27:23.321
Hello, miss?

01:27:29.107 --> 01:27:30.947
Look at this.

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:34.550
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

01:27:34.822 --> 01:27:37.222
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.

01:27:37.408 --> 01:27:40.328
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

01:27:40.537 --> 01:27:43.777
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:46.639
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:48.195
Miyagi show you something.

01:27:48.337 --> 01:27:50.857
I feel like the whole world
is coming down on me.

01:27:51.049 --> 01:27:53.809
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

01:27:54.052 --> 01:27:57.372
Everything can heal. Just take time.

01:27:57.597 --> 01:27:58.917
Take patience.

01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:03.859
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.

01:28:04.563 --> 01:28:07.603
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:10.470
Otherwise better just stay home.

01:28:13.405 --> 01:28:15.445
It's budding.

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:18.018
Look at that, it's gonna make it.

01:28:19.872 --> 01:28:22.512
Make it because have strong root.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.750
<i>Just like you, Daniel-san.</i>

01:28:26.921 --> 01:28:29.081
Inside you have strong root.

01:28:29.883 --> 01:28:33.723
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

01:28:36.348 --> 01:28:38.068
Understand?

01:28:42.104 --> 01:28:43.504
I do understand.

01:28:47.652 --> 01:28:49.292
You're right.

01:28:49.988 --> 01:28:53.468
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.

01:28:53.742 --> 01:28:54.942
Where going?

01:28:55.118 --> 01:28:58.758
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.

01:28:58.997 --> 01:29:01.957
He meant well,
but I want to tell him it's over.

01:29:02.167 --> 01:29:06.927
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.

01:29:07.214 --> 01:29:08.854
You like Miyagi come help you?

01:29:09.008 --> 01:29:12.888
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?

01:29:13.179 --> 01:29:15.379
I'll be back in a little while.

01:29:32.575 --> 01:29:33.735
Hello.

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.313
Mr. Silver?

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.670
Hello?

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:54.963
Hello?

01:29:57.602 --> 01:29:58.722
Mr. Silver?

01:29:59.604 --> 01:30:00.684
Hey.

01:30:01.899 --> 01:30:03.619
- Hi.
- Here you are.

01:30:03.775 --> 01:30:08.015
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.

01:30:08.364 --> 01:30:09.924
- And...
- And?

01:30:10.491 --> 01:30:13.731
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

01:30:14.454 --> 01:30:17.254
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

01:30:17.498 --> 01:30:19.778
I mean, you've been great. I just...

01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:23.450
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

01:30:23.756 --> 01:30:26.476
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person...

01:30:26.676 --> 01:30:29.676
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

01:30:29.887 --> 01:30:31.927
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.

01:30:32.098 --> 01:30:34.738
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...

01:30:34.934 --> 01:30:36.934
No. Nothing's for free.

01:30:37.896 --> 01:30:39.656
You are going to defend.

01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:42.149
You're getting in that ring.

01:30:42.359 --> 01:30:43.759
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...

01:30:43.902 --> 01:30:46.902
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

01:30:52.287 --> 01:30:53.607
Danny.

01:30:54.998 --> 01:30:58.558
Since you met me, I've made you do things
you didn't want to do.

01:30:58.836 --> 01:31:00.356
What are you talking about?

01:31:00.504 --> 01:31:02.464
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

01:31:02.673 --> 01:31:04.953
Let's show him what I'm talking about.

01:31:07.637 --> 01:31:10.237
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.

01:31:11.474 --> 01:31:14.634
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.

01:31:14.852 --> 01:31:18.412
Either you fight one fight
or fight for the rest of your life.

01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:20.529
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?

01:31:20.693 --> 01:31:24.373
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

01:31:28.534 --> 01:31:31.534
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

01:31:31.746 --> 01:31:33.986
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.

01:31:34.165 --> 01:31:36.845
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

01:31:41.256 --> 01:31:44.656
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.

01:31:45.678 --> 01:31:47.438
Yes!

01:31:49.807 --> 01:31:52.327
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.

01:31:52.519 --> 01:31:54.039
Bring him back.

01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:56.169
You see his face?

01:31:56.731 --> 01:31:59.331
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:16.615
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.

01:32:19.965 --> 01:32:21.645
What are you waiting for?

01:32:29.434 --> 01:32:30.834
Party time.

01:32:35.398 --> 01:32:37.038
We're old friends.

01:33:01.551 --> 01:33:03.271
Come on, little man.

01:33:03.429 --> 01:33:05.869
Let's see how good you really are.

01:33:48.269 --> 01:33:50.389
You think this is the end of it, old man?

01:33:50.563 --> 01:33:53.403
<i>I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos
all over this valley.</i>

01:33:53.608 --> 01:33:55.888
Hell, I might even teach for free.

01:33:56.153 --> 01:33:58.513
From now on when people say
karate around here...

01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:00.857
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.

01:34:01.033 --> 01:34:04.313
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

01:34:04.537 --> 01:34:07.177
Yes, he will. You won't.

01:34:10.585 --> 01:34:12.545
Now will you train me?

01:34:19.344 --> 01:34:21.304
Now Miyagi train you.

01:34:24.308 --> 01:34:26.348
Come. Waste time here.

01:36:10.173 --> 01:36:11.813
We plant tree here.

01:36:12.508 --> 01:36:14.388
- You take tree.
- All set.

01:36:14.636 --> 01:36:16.556
- Careful.
- I got it.

01:36:16.722 --> 01:36:20.242
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.

01:36:21.018 --> 01:36:23.938
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.

01:36:24.188 --> 01:36:26.148
Put you back where you belong.

01:36:27.566 --> 01:36:29.006
There you go.

01:36:29.319 --> 01:36:31.279
Nice comfortable spot.

01:36:31.488 --> 01:36:34.608
<i>- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-san.</i>

01:36:36.118 --> 01:36:39.238
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

01:36:41.957 --> 01:36:44.597
Let some of your old roots soak that up.

01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:48.889
<i>Daniel-san, this bonsai have strong root.</i>

01:36:49.632 --> 01:36:51.152
Same you.

01:36:52.051 --> 01:36:54.691
This tree now choose how it grow.

01:36:55.764 --> 01:36:58.084
So must you choose how you grow.

01:37:01.312 --> 01:37:03.832
Miyagi have great faith in you.

01:37:05.233 --> 01:37:06.913
Understand?

01:37:33.805 --> 01:37:35.605
<i>Come on, Daniel-san.</i>

01:37:55.871 --> 01:37:57.911
See you around, old fella.

01:38:12.306 --> 01:38:13.826
<i>Point Barnes!</i>

01:38:14.016 --> 01:38:16.656
<i>The score is 2-0.</i>

01:38:17.144 --> 01:38:19.784
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!

01:38:22.483 --> 01:38:25.243
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.

01:38:26.237 --> 01:38:29.317
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

01:38:29.532 --> 01:38:32.172
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.840
<i>Three points for Barnes.</i>

01:38:36.999 --> 01:38:39.799
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!

01:38:40.127 --> 01:38:41.767
Face me. Bow.

01:38:41.921 --> 01:38:43.321
Shake hands.

01:38:43.797 --> 01:38:45.837
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.

01:38:46.009 --> 01:38:48.649
<i>While we wait for the challenger
to catch his breath...</i>

01:38:48.844 --> 01:38:51.044
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

01:38:51.431 --> 01:38:55.311
<i>... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours
for the purchase and donation...</i>

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.720
<i>... of the permanent home
of the All Valley Championships.</i>

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:04.180
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.</i>

01:39:04.487 --> 01:39:06.247
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

01:39:09.659 --> 01:39:10.979
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

01:39:11.453 --> 01:39:13.013
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:17.894
<i>I've always lived my life by the rule:
"If you get, you give."</i>

01:39:19.336 --> 01:39:22.496
<i>For the last 20 years,
I've gotten from karate.</i>

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.420
<i>I've gotten discipline...</i>

01:39:25.635 --> 01:39:28.515
<i>... health, self-confidence...</i>

01:39:28.721 --> 01:39:30.241
<i>... inner peace.</i>

01:39:30.474 --> 01:39:33.034
<i>Everything that makes me
what I am today.</i>

01:39:33.476 --> 01:39:36.876
<i>And today, it's time for me to give back.</i>

01:39:40.067 --> 01:39:43.587
<i>It's my pleasure to announce
my partnership with the greatest...</i>

01:39:43.862 --> 01:39:47.742
<i>... karate man I have ever known,
Sensei John Kreese.</i>

01:39:48.076 --> 01:39:50.276
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.100
<i>Together, we are about to open
a chain of Cobra Kai dojos...</i>

01:40:00.423 --> 01:40:05.303
<i>... where young people can come
and learn the same values I've learned:</i>

01:40:07.055 --> 01:40:08.335
<i>Honesty...</i>

01:40:09.307 --> 01:40:10.907
<i>... compassion...</i>

01:40:11.643 --> 01:40:13.323
<i>... and fair play.</i>

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:17.700
<i>Thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the final match.</i>

01:40:18.358 --> 01:40:20.078
<i>Thank you, Mr. Silver.</i>

01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:26.570
<i>And thank you again
for your most generous contribution.</i>

01:40:26.826 --> 01:40:28.466
Remember the game plan.

01:40:28.662 --> 01:40:30.982
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:34.764
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

01:40:35.002 --> 01:40:37.842
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

01:40:38.047 --> 01:40:40.207
I want him to experience pain.

01:40:40.383 --> 01:40:42.983
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

01:40:43.219 --> 01:40:47.579
<i>Representing the Cobra Kai,
the challenger, Mike Barnes.</i>

01:40:51.227 --> 01:40:54.907
<i>And in this corner,
someone who needs no introduction...</i>

01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:58.429
<i>... the defending champion
from the Miyagi dojo...</i>

01:40:58.736 --> 01:41:00.696
<i>... Daniel LaRusso.</i>

01:41:16.922 --> 01:41:19.402
<i>This match will have
a three-minute time limit.</i>

01:41:19.592 --> 01:41:23.832
<i>The first fighter to score three points
will be designated this year's...</i>

01:41:24.138 --> 01:41:26.538
<i>... All Valley Under-18 Champion.</i>

01:41:26.724 --> 01:41:29.244
<i>- Fighters to your marks!
- Go out there and get him.</i>

01:41:29.436 --> 01:41:31.076
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!

01:41:31.229 --> 01:41:36.429
<i>Remember, folks, the new rule this year
states that if there is no winner...</i>

01:41:36.735 --> 01:41:40.775
<i>... at the end of three minutes
the championship match will go...</i>

01:41:41.032 --> 01:41:43.152
<i>... into sudden-death overtime.</i>

01:41:43.326 --> 01:41:45.566
When it's over,
his mother won't recognise him.

01:41:45.745 --> 01:41:46.825
You both know the rules.

01:41:46.954 --> 01:41:50.554
Light contact is allowed to the body,
and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.

01:41:50.792 --> 01:41:52.752
No face contact is allowed.

01:41:53.087 --> 01:41:56.047
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

01:41:57.258 --> 01:41:58.018
On your lines.

01:41:58.134 --> 01:41:59.774
Come on, Daniel!

01:42:00.887 --> 01:42:04.567
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.

01:42:05.099 --> 01:42:06.499
I said bow.

01:42:07.519 --> 01:42:10.119
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

01:42:13.984 --> 01:42:17.504
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:18.898
Begin!

01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:24.390
<i>Point, Barnes.</i>

01:42:24.537 --> 01:42:26.497
<i>Score: 1-0.</i>

01:42:26.665 --> 01:42:28.225
Look over at the slope.

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:29.855
Is that perfect?

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:33.751
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

01:42:34.006 --> 01:42:35.326
Begin!

01:42:40.138 --> 01:42:43.338
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?

01:42:43.933 --> 01:42:46.653
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!

01:42:46.853 --> 01:42:49.213
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

01:42:49.397 --> 01:42:53.677
<i>That illegal groin kick
will cost Barnes his previous point.</i>

01:42:54.236 --> 01:42:56.956
<i>Score is now 0-0.</i>

01:42:57.406 --> 01:42:59.526
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:02.140
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.

01:43:02.328 --> 01:43:06.208
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:16.613
That's the one, Mike.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.640
<i>Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.</i>

01:43:19.847 --> 01:43:21.207
Go, Daniel!

01:43:22.058 --> 01:43:23.658
Come on, Daniel.

01:43:24.436 --> 01:43:26.116
Let's go, LaRusso.

01:43:27.897 --> 01:43:29.137
Point Barnes.

01:43:29.315 --> 01:43:31.275
Score is 1-0. Ready?

01:43:31.443 --> 01:43:33.483
Come on, Mike, you got him.

01:43:33.738 --> 01:43:35.058
Begin!

01:43:36.698 --> 01:43:38.538
Break, break!

01:43:39.034 --> 01:43:40.514
On your line!

01:43:41.204 --> 01:43:44.444
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

01:43:44.665 --> 01:43:47.665
<i>That illegal punch
will cost Barnes one point.</i>

01:43:48.044 --> 01:43:50.164
<i>The score is again 0-0.</i>

01:43:50.338 --> 01:43:52.258
You all right, LaRusso?

01:43:53.466 --> 01:43:55.786
Intentional face contact, penalty point.

01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:58.090
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.

01:43:58.514 --> 01:44:00.354
Fighting positions.

01:44:00.516 --> 01:44:02.276
Ready? Begin!

01:44:05.981 --> 01:44:08.501
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.

01:44:10.402 --> 01:44:11.642
On your lines.

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.100
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:16.562
Come on, Barnes!

01:44:18.703 --> 01:44:21.383
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

01:44:25.877 --> 01:44:27.997
Break! Break!

01:44:28.379 --> 01:44:29.699
On your line.

01:44:29.965 --> 01:44:31.205
He'll get up.

01:44:31.383 --> 01:44:33.183
He's too dumb not to.

01:44:34.427 --> 01:44:37.147
LaRusso, on your line.

01:44:37.849 --> 01:44:39.809
Get up, you pansy-ass!

01:44:42.187 --> 01:44:45.027
<i>- No point for kick to the back.
- No point scored.</i>

01:44:45.273 --> 01:44:49.313
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

01:44:52.781 --> 01:44:53.861
Break!

01:44:55.701 --> 01:44:57.861
What's the matter, you can't breathe?

01:44:58.037 --> 01:45:00.677
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.760
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.

01:45:05.003 --> 01:45:07.523
<i>No clean technique on that exchange.</i>

01:45:07.922 --> 01:45:09.442
<i>No point scored.</i>

01:45:09.966 --> 01:45:12.406
<i>The score remains 0-0.</i>

01:45:13.011 --> 01:45:15.091
<i>Ten seconds left in the match.</i>

01:45:15.264 --> 01:45:17.104
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.

01:45:17.266 --> 01:45:19.866
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!

01:45:21.187 --> 01:45:22.427
Time!

01:45:23.148 --> 01:45:24.468
Break!

01:45:25.275 --> 01:45:27.595
<i>There will be a one-minute rest period.</i>

01:45:27.778 --> 01:45:30.498
<i>Then the match will continue
with sudden death.</i>

01:45:30.697 --> 01:45:33.937
<i>- Daniel-san!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.</i>

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.814
- No!
- It's over, forget it.

01:45:35.953 --> 01:45:37.633
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.

01:45:37.788 --> 01:45:39.428
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!

01:45:39.582 --> 01:45:41.262
Is okay to lose to opponent.

01:45:41.417 --> 01:45:44.657
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

01:45:44.879 --> 01:45:48.359
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

01:45:49.384 --> 01:45:51.304
You stay focused.

01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:55.918
<i>Daniel-san,
your best karate is still inside you.</i>

01:45:56.558 --> 01:45:58.198
Now time let out!

01:46:00.438 --> 01:46:02.838
<i>That's the end of the rest period.</i>

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:05.744
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!

01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:08.385
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

01:46:08.572 --> 01:46:10.972
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

01:46:11.158 --> 01:46:13.758
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

01:46:13.994 --> 01:46:16.354
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!

01:46:16.539 --> 01:46:19.499
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

01:46:19.708 --> 01:46:21.188
You're done, LaRusso.

01:46:21.335 --> 01:46:24.015
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

01:46:24.214 --> 01:46:29.574
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

01:46:29.928 --> 01:46:33.008
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.

01:46:33.224 --> 01:46:35.064
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

01:46:35.226 --> 01:46:36.626
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:41.860
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

01:46:47.614 --> 01:46:49.254
Fighting positions.

01:46:49.616 --> 01:46:50.776
Ready?

01:46:51.952 --> 01:46:53.112
Begin!

01:46:53.454 --> 01:46:55.614
Mike! Take him out!

01:47:00.962 --> 01:47:02.202
Hit him!

01:47:05.759 --> 01:47:07.959
Get the point! Get the point!

01:47:08.554 --> 01:47:11.594
Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating.

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:21.553
Winner!

01:47:21.693 --> 01:47:26.613
<i>The winner and the first to ever win
two years in a row...</i>

01:47:27.658 --> 01:47:30.738
<i>... the grand champion, Daniel LaRusso. </i>

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:35.666
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:57.949
We did it! We did it!
