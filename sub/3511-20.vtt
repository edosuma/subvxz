00:17.500 --> 00:19.840
- God. Her face.
- What happened to her?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.760
I got a pulse.
She's still alive.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.710
Get a gurney.
Now!

00:31.230 --> 00:32.259
Where'd it go?

00:32.600 --> 00:33.860
Where'd what go, darling?

00:34.060 --> 00:36.500
My leftovers from le cirque.
They were right here.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.740
Right where this hole
in the fridge is.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.130
I was gonna use
that chateaubriand

00:40.130 --> 00:41.220
for my morning scramble.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.890
Well, I certainly
didn't eat them.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.700
I wouldn't look
this good if I was...

00:44.700 --> 00:46.930
pigging out on leftovers.

00:46.930 --> 00:49.200
Yes, well, this isn't
the first time this has happened.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.690
Food has been going missing
for the past month.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.150
It's not just leftovers, either.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.530
It was the peanut butter,
uh, artichokes,

00:55.530 --> 00:58.190
A whole quart
of mulligatawny soup--gone.

00:58.190 --> 01:01.180
Well, maybe you've been
sleep eating again.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.820
Again?
I've never sleep ated-- sleep ate--

01:03.820 --> 01:05.470
Eaten-- have I?

01:05.470 --> 01:06.920
Hey. I'm off to class.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.070
How did you like that,
uh, chateaubriand?

01:11.250 --> 01:13.250
Wasn't that a wonderful
white wine reduction?

01:13.250 --> 01:14.600
What chateaubriand?

01:15.140 --> 01:17.380
All right.
It's the housekeeper.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.270
I knew it.
She has been putting on weight.

01:19.270 --> 01:21.460
Sorry, darling.
She hasn't been here for three days.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.840
Maybe there are tiny borrowers living
under the floorboards

01:22.840 --> 01:25.530
who come out at night
to steal your food.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.790
It's not realistic.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.550
They'd be too small
to get the fridge door open.

01:28.550 --> 01:30.560
No, but something
is going on here, though.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.480
And I'm gonna find out what.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.000
So some food disappeared, Castle.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.980
What's the big deal?

01:36.980 --> 01:37.930
It wasn't you, was it?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.370
I know you hate
to go grocery shopping.

01:39.370 --> 01:40.300
Seriously, castle?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.390
I haven't been
to your place since Tuesday.

01:43.060 --> 01:43.790
Right.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.340
Maybe my apartment's being invaded
by some kind of super rat.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.050
Whatever's going on,
i've taken bold steps

01:48.050 --> 01:49.740
to ensure it never happens again.

01:51.350 --> 01:52.490
These two nurses saw some guy

01:52.490 --> 01:54.690
do a dump and drive around 4:00 A.M.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.420
The trauma unit
tried to save our vic,

01:56.420 --> 01:57.480
But she didn't make it.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.410
If he's our killer,
why would he take her to the E.R.?

01:59.410 --> 02:01.080
Maybe he had a guilty conscience.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.810
Did the nurses get a good look
at the driver?

02:02.810 --> 02:04.150
No, but they did see his car.

02:04.150 --> 02:04.940
It was a blue sedan.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.620
Hospital security's
trying to get me some footage

02:06.620 --> 02:07.380
to get the license plate.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.120
Okay, set up a canvass
around the hospital.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.320
We need to find someone
that got a good look at the driver.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.500
And where's our vic?

02:12.740 --> 02:13.850
Her body's still
in the trauma bay.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.000
Word is,
she was pretty messed up.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.330
Uh, let me caution you.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.110
This is not
for the faint of heart.

02:26.860 --> 02:28.160
For once, I agree with you.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.070
What did this to her?

02:31.070 --> 02:33.970
Could be anything
from a crowbar to a box cutter.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.900
But they look like claw marks.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.570
I just can't tell what kind.

02:39.090 --> 02:40.890
If it was an animal,
wouldn't there be bite marks?

02:40.890 --> 02:43.430
I might not find them
until I do a complete exam

02:43.430 --> 02:45.060
to determine
the exact cause of death.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.650
Given the fact that we don't have
a crime scene,

02:46.650 --> 02:48.720
is there any indication
of where she was attacked?

02:48.720 --> 02:50.730
No, but, uh,
i can tell you when.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.430
Based on the inflammation,
i'd say the victim

02:52.440 --> 02:55.390
sustained her injuries
five to six hours before she died.

02:55.390 --> 02:56.600
Well, we figure out
who she is,

02:56.610 --> 02:58.620
We'll find out
how she wound up this way.

02:58.810 --> 03:00.880
Her name is Anne Cardinal,
27 years old.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.130
She was native american.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.800
Grew up on the onondaga reservation
in central New York.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.070
Any next of kin?

03:06.210 --> 03:07.660
No. She had no siblings,

03:07.670 --> 03:08.920
And both of her parents are gone.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.100
She lived in off-campus housing
for Hudson University,

03:11.100 --> 03:14.310
Where she was working toward
a PhD in Evolutionary Biology.

03:14.310 --> 03:15.810
All right.
Send C.S.U. to her apartment.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.410
Talk to friends and neighbors
to see if they know of

03:17.410 --> 03:19.570
anyone in her life
who drove a blue sedan.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.950
And who wanted to mangle her face.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.530
I may have an explanation
for those facial wounds.

03:24.530 --> 03:27.310
Turns out our victim worked
at a retirement home called haven house.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.260
Vicious, blood-thirsty old folks,

03:29.260 --> 03:30.300
is that your theory?

03:30.300 --> 03:32.490
This home is not for people, Castle.

03:32.490 --> 03:33.900
It's a primate sanctuary.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.160
Mostly for apes
and chimpanzees and monkeys

03:36.160 --> 03:37.600
who have retired
from the movie business.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.250
Ah, I always wanted a pet monkey
when I was a kid.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.510
Big "Curious George" Fan.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.340
Yeah. Wait till George grows up.

03:43.340 --> 03:45.510
An adult chimpanzee
can reach 200 pounds,

03:45.510 --> 03:48.100
Tear off a man's face,
hands, and naughty bits.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.010
All right, we're gonna go
to the primate sanctuary.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.030
If Anne was attacked there,

03:51.030 --> 03:53.370
maybe someone dumped
her body to cover it up.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.470
And call me if you get
anything on that sedan.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.990
George would never do that.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.230
This is a terrible loss.

04:00.230 --> 04:03.040
Uh, I mean,
Anne was a-a brilliant student

04:03.040 --> 04:05.200
and a lovely person.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.380
Given her wounds, I need to ask,

04:08.390 --> 04:11.350
how much interaction did Anne have
with the primates here?

04:11.350 --> 04:13.860
Well, very little
in terms of direct contact.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.180
Uh, but we have very
strict training guidelines

04:16.180 --> 04:17.810
for all of our employees.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.959
Still, I'll need
the crime scene unit

04:19.959 --> 04:22.400
to do a thorough investigation
of this facility.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.030
Of course. Anything I can do to help.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.200
I can't imagine she was harmed
by any of our animals.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.250
They've never shown
any aggressive behavior

04:28.250 --> 04:30.090
towards her or anyone else.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.180
Now, Dr. Devlin,
how well did you know Anne Cardinal?

04:34.180 --> 04:36.620
I was her faculty advisor
at Hudson University.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.230
And when I found out

04:37.240 --> 04:38.870
she was taking time off
a couple of months ago,

04:38.870 --> 04:40.460
I offered her a job here.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.330
And what sort of work
did she do?

04:42.330 --> 04:43.000
Oh, I have a grant

04:43.000 --> 04:44.680
to study the social behaviors
of primates.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.220
And I hire Hudson students...

04:46.220 --> 04:47.490
Like her and Franco here

04:47.490 --> 04:49.770
to help manage the animals' care.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.570
Uh, and none of them
have homicidal impulses,

04:52.570 --> 04:53.810
not even Moonshine here?

04:53.970 --> 04:55.310
Especially not moonshine.

04:55.310 --> 04:57.390
He's been around people
his whole life,

04:57.390 --> 04:58.790
And he's very social.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.070
Uh, when was the last time either
of you saw Anne?

05:02.200 --> 05:05.920
We worked together yesterday.
She seemed totally fine.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.920
She did leave early.
That wasn't like her.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.820
Said she had
something important to do.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.350
Did she say what it was?

05:11.950 --> 05:14.000
It might have had something to do
with that argument she had.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.120
What argument?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.690
Uh, I saw her in the parking garage
around lunchtime,

05:17.690 --> 05:18.600
talking to a man.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.870
I'd never seen him before,

05:19.880 --> 05:22.230
But he seemed very angry with her.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.490
Do you think you could describe him
to a sketch artist?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.980
Yeah, I most definitely could.

05:32.260 --> 05:33.670
Well, I know who the killer is.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.340
Did you see
how that gorilla looked at me?

05:35.340 --> 05:37.220
Yeah, I think it was lust,
actually, Castle.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.930
You are... ruggedly handsome.

05:38.930 --> 05:40.270
Bloodlust, maybe.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.670
No, don't let Moonshine fool you.

05:41.670 --> 05:44.000
I'm betting he
and his fellow "Retirees"

05:44.000 --> 05:46.270
Are actually super-intelligent apes,

05:46.270 --> 05:47.920
Plotting to take over
New York city.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.220
They're gonna round up
all the people,

05:49.220 --> 05:50.520
Put us in a sanctuary.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.980
Most likely,
Anne got on to them...

05:53.100 --> 05:53.930
They took her out.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.180
Now if this monkey cabal

05:55.180 --> 05:57.600
really wanted to get Anne out
of the picture,

05:57.600 --> 05:59.570
Why did they drop her off
at the hospital?

05:59.570 --> 06:01.700
Well, obviously...
they were conflicted.

06:01.700 --> 06:05.330
It's very complicated,
the relationship between man and primate.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.670
Didn't you see
"Rise of the planet of the apes"?

06:08.410 --> 06:09.430
Cautionary tale.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.550
Sorry to burst your bubble, Castle,

06:10.550 --> 06:12.920
But C.S.U. hasn't found
a crime scene at haven house.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.250
Anne wasn't attacked there.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.750
Well, then where was the attack,
and by what?

06:16.750 --> 06:17.990
Hey, so, uh,

06:17.990 --> 06:20.580
a witness saw a blue sedan
take out a side mirror

06:20.580 --> 06:22.070
about a block away
from our hospital

06:22.070 --> 06:23.060
in our time window.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.070
They got a plate.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.700
Owner of the car
was Eddie Maslon.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.620
- How is he connected to Anne?
- Well, I'm not really sure,

06:28.620 --> 06:30.390
but Eddie knows
how to put the hurt on people.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.980
He just did eight years
in Sing Sing for murder two.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.470
And he had a way
to mess up Anne's face.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.500
City records shows
he had a pit bull named Badass.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.560
A convicted killer
with an attack dog?

06:40.950 --> 06:42.080
All right. Pick him up.

06:42.080 --> 06:42.970
Right on.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.490
Damn it.

06:45.010 --> 06:46.530
I really liked Moonshine for this.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.670
I've never seen her before.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.880
You dumped her outside
of the E.R. last night,

06:52.880 --> 06:54.950
except she looked more like...

06:55.070 --> 06:56.030
this.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.880
Your dog do that to her?

07:00.560 --> 07:02.080
Eddie, you've been out of prison
for three months.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.130
You better start talking
unless you want to go back.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.630
Okay, look, I didn't touch her.

07:08.910 --> 07:10.430
And neither did Badass.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.010
Whatever did that to her,

07:12.010 --> 07:13.330
that wasn't no dog.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.270
Then how'd she end up
in your car?

07:15.370 --> 07:16.920
I was leaving a bar last night,

07:16.920 --> 07:19.580
and I happened to make
a wrong turn down an alleyway.

07:19.580 --> 07:21.370
And I saw her laying there.
She was all messed up.

07:21.370 --> 07:22.710
I couldn't just
leave her there to die.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.920
Oh, so you're
a good samaritan now?

07:24.920 --> 07:25.920
If I wanted to kill her,

07:25.920 --> 07:27.400
why would I bring her
to a hospital?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.980
If you wanted to save her,

07:28.980 --> 07:31.190
why would you
ditch her outside of one?

07:31.190 --> 07:33.700
Because with my record,
i knew I'd get blamed,

07:33.700 --> 07:35.490
which is exactly
what's happening now.

07:35.930 --> 07:36.840
Yeah.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.730
No good deed, huh?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.530
Okay, fine.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.380
Then why don't you tell me
where you supposedly found her?

07:51.360 --> 07:52.470
Well, it's blood.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.480
Maybe Eddie
was telling the truth.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.220
Beckett.

07:58.530 --> 07:59.820
You need to see this.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.200
What the...

08:08.220 --> 08:09.340
Footprints.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.260
Giant footprints...

08:11.990 --> 08:14.910
Made by some kind of beast.
Those vicious claw marks,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.080
savage wounds,

08:18.690 --> 08:19.710
her blood,

08:20.960 --> 08:22.190
these footprints...

08:23.770 --> 08:25.360
It all adds up to one thing.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.530
She was killed by bigfoot.

08:43.659 --> 08:44.630
Seriously, Beckett,

08:44.630 --> 08:46.540
Do you have any idea
what this means?

08:46.540 --> 08:48.820
We are about to be
the first people in the nation--

08:48.820 --> 08:51.340
no, the world--
to solve a bigfoot murder.

08:51.340 --> 08:54.130
Very funny, Castle,
but there is no such thing as bigfoot.

08:54.130 --> 08:55.000
Tell that to the people

08:55.000 --> 08:56.770
who've been sighting him
for 400 years.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.700
So I typed the blood.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.920
It's a match to our victim.

08:59.930 --> 09:00.830
Never mind the blood.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.120
What is your opinion on these?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.030
Well, professionally,
i can't speculate

09:05.030 --> 09:06.280
what those are, Mr. Castle.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.560
But personally, I can say

09:08.570 --> 09:10.630
that anyone who believes
in bigfoot is an ass.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.650
That is a common assertion
amongst the uninformed.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.180
Okay, buddy,
let's say there is a bigfoot.

09:19.180 --> 09:20.640
How does a giant hairy ape-man

09:20.640 --> 09:22.100
get around the city unseen?

09:22.100 --> 09:25.040
Easy.
Follow the big fat footprints.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.070
What?

09:27.070 --> 09:29.920
Subway access tunnel.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.520
Since hurricane Sandy,
a lot of those are still closed.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.530
So bigfoot's been using them
to get around.

09:34.590 --> 09:36.070
Castle, that's ridiculous.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.340
How can you say...

09:37.960 --> 09:39.770
Look at these footprints.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.550
These are the footprints
that I'm interested in.

09:42.550 --> 09:43.980
They're near where the body was.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.690
C.S.U. Said that they were made
within the last 24 hours.

09:46.690 --> 09:47.800
Could be Eddie Maslon's?

09:47.800 --> 09:48.670
At size 13?

09:48.670 --> 09:51.060
The guy's too short
to have feet this big. No.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.270
These boot prints are our best lead.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.320
These prints,

09:54.440 --> 09:57.530
not the tracks
from the giant clown feet.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.530
Yes, let's go to a crime scene
and ignore the evidence.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.690
You're saying
someone framed bigfoot?

10:04.690 --> 10:06.670
All I'm saying, Castle,
is that someone--

10:06.670 --> 10:07.660
A human being--

10:07.660 --> 10:09.580
left the bigfoot prints
in that alleyway.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.260
Yeah, and staged the crime scene

10:11.260 --> 10:13.330
to make it look as though bigfoot
was the killer?

10:13.330 --> 10:15.280
Why go through the trouble
of blaming bigfoot,

10:15.280 --> 10:17.810
a creature a select few of us
even believe exists,

10:17.810 --> 10:19.750
never mind could
be a murder suspect?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.130
Speaking of suspects,

10:21.130 --> 10:23.770
Anne's boss came through
with a sketch of the guy

10:23.770 --> 10:25.450
she argued with the day she died.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.090
Take a look, Castle.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.990
A person of interest,
emphasis on the word "Person."

10:31.180 --> 10:32.660
Talk to Anne's friends
and family

10:32.660 --> 10:34.340
and see if anyone recognizes him.

10:34.990 --> 10:36.830
I wouldn't rule out bigfoot
just yet.

10:36.830 --> 10:39.410
Turns out there have been dozens
of reported bigfoot sightings

10:39.410 --> 10:41.160
in the city in the past
couple of months.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.420
Is that right?

10:42.430 --> 10:43.940
Why, Detective Ryan,
please tell us

10:43.940 --> 10:46.050
about this new
and extraordinary development.

10:46.050 --> 10:47.490
Like this woman in brooklyn.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.540
She says that bigfoot tried to break
into her apartment

10:50.560 --> 10:52.730
- On the second floor.
- Gentlemen.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.330
I hate to rain on your parade.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.900
- Do you?
- No.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.080
But here's the reason

10:58.080 --> 10:59.770
that bigfoot reports have spiked.

10:59.930 --> 11:00.740
Two months ago,

11:00.740 --> 11:03.560
The TV show "Mission: monster,"

11:03.560 --> 11:05.310
put out a $1 million reward

11:05.310 --> 11:07.820
for the capture and/or proof
that bigfoot exists.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.230
See, Castle?
All of this evidence

11:10.230 --> 11:12.500
that you claim proves
bigfoot's existence

11:12.500 --> 11:15.260
is actually people angling
for money.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.440
So you're saying
it's just a coincidence

11:17.440 --> 11:18.980
that Anne was working
with primates

11:18.980 --> 11:21.480
and mysteriously killed
where bigfoot prints were found?

11:21.480 --> 11:24.170
No, not a coincidence.
Just a hoax.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.390
If it's such a hoax,

11:25.390 --> 11:27.290
then tell me why I found this.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.890
I dug into her phone records.

11:28.890 --> 11:31.400
Turns out, the last phone call
she ever made

11:31.590 --> 11:32.910
was to Darrell Meeks.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.090
The Darrell Meeks?

11:34.090 --> 11:35.220
Who's Darrell Meeks?

11:35.220 --> 11:36.420
Who's Darrell Meeks?

11:36.420 --> 11:38.550
Just a world-renowned
cryptozoologist.

11:38.550 --> 11:39.530
That's a scientist

11:39.530 --> 11:41.820
who searches for as-yet
undiscovered creatures.

11:41.820 --> 11:44.240
Such as unicorns and centaurs?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.930
Banshees and leprechauns?

11:46.450 --> 11:48.240
Doctor Meeks also happens to be

11:48.240 --> 11:50.460
the foremost authority on bigfoot.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.000
And lo and behold, she called him
on the very day she died.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.040
Still think bigfoot
has nothing to do with this?

11:57.810 --> 11:59.320
Perlmutter's got something for us.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.340
Why don't you guys head
over there?

12:00.340 --> 12:01.080
Castle and I will talk to

12:01.080 --> 12:03.830
the world's foremost authority
on bigfoot.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.440
The "B" Team.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.160
- Talk about the "B" Team. - Yeah.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.480
Look, I had hoped
to see Castle's look of dismay

12:11.480 --> 12:12.800
when I told him cause of death

12:12.800 --> 12:16.800
was nothing more exotic
than blunt-force trauma to the cranium.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.680
It--it seems that she was clobbered
over the head

12:19.690 --> 12:21.290
with a club or a pipe.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.750
You coulda said so
over the phone.

12:22.750 --> 12:26.200
Ah, but I also made
two highly intriguing discoveries.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
About the wounds on her face?

12:27.200 --> 12:29.420
Uh, well,
their cause is still undetermined,

12:29.420 --> 12:31.030
But of far greater interest
is the fact--

12:31.030 --> 12:32.240
'cause they could be claw marks.

12:33.510 --> 12:34.440
Bigfoot has claws.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.610
So does wolverine. Is he real?

12:37.040 --> 12:38.200
Are you done?

12:39.370 --> 12:41.860
I found this glass embedded
in her head wound.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.060
It has an antireflective coating,

12:44.060 --> 12:45.760
like on prescription lenses.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.910
But she didn't wear glasses.
So where'd it come from?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.230
All I can tell you
is that it was practically

12:51.230 --> 12:53.260
hammered into her skull
by whatever hit her.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.830
We'll send it in for analysis.

12:54.830 --> 12:57.270
Yeah, well, you should
take this while you're at it.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.250
Found that in her stomach.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.190
A pendant... in her stomach?

13:02.190 --> 13:06.510
It appears she swallowed
it five to six hours before she died.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.010
The same time she was attacked.

13:09.030 --> 13:09.930
Why would she swallow it?

13:09.930 --> 13:11.210
Maybe she knew she was gonna die

13:11.210 --> 13:12.640
And she was trying
to send a message.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.040
Or she was trying
to keep this pendant from her killer.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.510
Did you take this photo?

13:20.630 --> 13:23.920
Yes. Uh, it's an expedition I led
in western Canada.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.150
It's the closest I've ever gotten
to him in 23 years.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.250
Dr. Meeks,

13:27.380 --> 13:30.330
You were the last person that Anne spoke
with just before she died.

13:30.330 --> 13:31.600
Why did she call you?

13:31.600 --> 13:32.960
Yes, I-I think she called me to ask me

13:32.960 --> 13:36.220
if I thought that bigfoot
would venture into an urban area.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.050
And what did you tell her?

13:38.050 --> 13:39.570
Well, given development

13:39.570 --> 13:42.000
and urban encroachment
in the wilderness,

13:42.010 --> 13:43.230
sooner or later,
it was inevitable.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.670
And I suspect
that she had evidence

13:45.670 --> 13:48.270
of the presence of bigfoot here
in the city.

13:49.850 --> 13:52.940
I don't understand why she would talk to you
about something like that.

13:52.940 --> 13:55.950
Well, Anne was studying
evolutionary biology.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.500
She was an honor student
at the university,

13:58.680 --> 14:02.500
but she was actually
a hugely respected bigfoot expert.

14:02.610 --> 14:06.630
She even gave me that
extremely rare yeti finger.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.820
Are you saying Anne
was a bigfoot hunter?

14:08.820 --> 14:09.870
N-n-no, no.

14:09.870 --> 14:12.240
No, uh, no, not a--not a hunter.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.530
No, uh, Anne was, uh,
native American.

14:14.530 --> 14:17.420
And, uh, in her tribe's culture,

14:17.420 --> 14:21.280
a bigfoot was considered...
benevolent or a protector.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.210
When she was a child,
she actually saw a bigfoot,

14:23.210 --> 14:26.910
and so after that,
she devoted her life to their study.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.170
Excuse me.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.800
So are bigfoots--

14:29.800 --> 14:33.390
or bigfeet-- uh,
violent or aggressive?

14:33.390 --> 14:34.390
Well, they certainly can be.

14:34.390 --> 14:35.900
What were the nature
of her injuries?

14:36.780 --> 14:39.160
Well, I mean,
was she attacked by a bigfoot?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.290
- Not a chance.
- Yes.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.030
Well, in the name of science,

14:42.030 --> 14:43.990
would you allow me
to examine where she died?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.870
No. Now as far as you're aware,

14:45.870 --> 14:48.300
did she have issues
with anyone other than bigfoot?

14:49.370 --> 14:52.510
Well, she was under
a very high level of scrutiny.

14:52.530 --> 14:53.480
Scrutiny from whom?

14:53.480 --> 14:56.010
Oh, some TV show offered
a $1-million reward,

14:56.010 --> 14:57.940
which unleashed
a tide of idiots,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.360
all searching for bigfoot.

14:59.370 --> 15:00.770
Yes, and, uh,

15:00.770 --> 15:04.050
this is my wife Garland.
Uh, she's the skeptical one.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.380
Trust me. I feel your pain.
Pleasure.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.040
In either case,
i think when people found out

15:09.050 --> 15:11.430
Anne's area of expertise,
they wanted to follow her

15:11.430 --> 15:14.630
to see if she would actually
take them to a real bigfoot.

15:14.630 --> 15:15.920
You know,
the day that she died,

15:16.110 --> 15:19.040
Anne was seen arguing with this man.

15:19.370 --> 15:20.650
Do you recognize him?

15:21.630 --> 15:23.630
Oh, yes. All too well.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.620
This man is the bigfoot
community's worst enemy.

15:27.670 --> 15:28.770
His name is Chase Diggins,

15:28.770 --> 15:29.990
and he's
an Australian adventurer

15:29.990 --> 15:31.200
and big game hunter.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.700
Kind of Crocodile Dundee meets
Indiana Jones

15:33.700 --> 15:34.590
meets Ted Nugent.

15:34.590 --> 15:35.820
Now according to the Meekses,

15:35.820 --> 15:37.830
he's violent and highly unstable.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.140
What's more is that this guy
is hell-bent on bagging a bigfoot.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.040
I found him on YouTube

15:42.040 --> 15:43.890
bragging about
how he's gonna mount one on his wall.

15:43.890 --> 15:46.110
Do we have anything other
than speculation

15:46.110 --> 15:47.580
on a mythical ape-man

15:47.590 --> 15:49.250
that will connect him
to the murder?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.180
We have this.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.870
Diggins has a prosthetic hook
for a hand?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.200
Says he lost it
in a bigfoot attack

15:56.200 --> 15:57.110
And that he almost took--

15:57.110 --> 15:58.730
However it happened,

15:59.140 --> 16:01.630
That hook could've been what did
a number on Anne's face.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.010
Where's Chase Diggins now?

16:05.420 --> 16:07.210
This guy is
an international adventurer.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.390
What the hell is he doing?

16:08.390 --> 16:10.210
Renting an industrial crap
hole like this?

16:10.210 --> 16:11.330
Why not a hotel?

16:12.490 --> 16:13.760
The guy hunts bigfoot.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.530
I don't think that
rational behavior

16:15.540 --> 16:16.970
is something he's familiar with.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.500
You hear that?

16:23.840 --> 16:24.900
Yeah.

16:31.180 --> 16:32.390
Dude,
there's something down there.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.430
Chase Diggins!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.250
NYPD!

16:40.040 --> 16:42.010
If you're down here,
you better identify yourself

16:42.010 --> 16:43.040
right now!

16:45.790 --> 16:46.770
Dude...

16:47.270 --> 16:48.690
I got a bad feeling
about this thing, man.

16:48.690 --> 16:50.750
I-I don't think that we should--

16:53.010 --> 16:54.420
You gents looking for me?

17:04.890 --> 17:06.420
A bloody shame about Anne.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.410
She was one hell of a tracker.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.750
Actually, the only reason
i came to the city.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.410
Word was, she knew the whereabouts
of an actual squatch,

17:13.410 --> 17:15.079
and I figured,
she might lead me to him.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.359
You came to new york

17:16.369 --> 17:17.880
to hunt bigfoot?

17:18.140 --> 17:19.310
You see this, detective?

17:19.319 --> 17:21.470
Nepal, 2008,

17:21.599 --> 17:23.430
in the rocky crags
of the Himalayas...

17:24.240 --> 17:25.780
A squatch came out of nowhere

17:25.790 --> 17:27.630
and ripped my arm clean off.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.200
So I will hunt down every last one
of those bastards

17:30.200 --> 17:31.750
until I have my payback.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.060
What did it look like?

17:33.250 --> 17:35.690
500 pounds
of fur and death, mate.

17:35.690 --> 17:37.290
Eyes like a rabid dog,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.040
but smart, you know?

17:39.170 --> 17:40.860
Anyway, they say
that she found one.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.680
Everyone knew it,
but Anne wasn't talking.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.920
Is that why you went
to see her?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.350
Who told you that?

17:48.580 --> 17:50.980
Witnesses saw you
and Anne arguing

17:50.980 --> 17:53.130
outside of her work yesterday.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.190
Merely a polite conversation
between colleagues.

17:57.870 --> 17:58.800
Really?

17:59.310 --> 18:01.640
'cause later that night,
she turned up dead.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.260
You're squattin' in the wrong bush,
detective.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.030
I was at a target range
last night with my mates,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.420
keeping my edge sharp.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.830
You can check it out.

18:10.830 --> 18:13.220
That's funny, 'cause we found
a boot print in alleyway

18:13.220 --> 18:15.080
near a pool of Anne's blood
with the same tread

18:15.080 --> 18:16.560
As the boots you're wearing now.

18:20.190 --> 18:21.790
All right, look,
i was in that alley,

18:22.620 --> 18:24.680
but not last night,
it was the night before.

18:25.090 --> 18:26.320
What were you doing there?

18:26.770 --> 18:28.230
Well, I figured
she was tracking the beast,

18:28.230 --> 18:29.320
so I tracked her.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.370
I followed her
to the alley, and...

18:31.860 --> 18:33.880
That's when I caught
the wily bitch in the act.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.960
The act of what?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.450
Stamping fake Squatch prints
in the ground is what,

18:37.450 --> 18:39.220
using molds of giant feet.

18:39.230 --> 18:40.540
She was faking
the damn evidence.

18:40.540 --> 18:41.990
Now, whoa.
Okay, hang--

18:41.990 --> 18:44.120
Anne was a respected researcher.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.190
Why would she fake evidence
of bigfoot?

18:46.240 --> 18:48.450
Because I reckon
she found the real thing,

18:48.450 --> 18:50.070
and she was trying to throw
the rest of us off the scent.

18:50.070 --> 18:52.490
But I was on to her,
so I confronted her at work.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.210
Offered her anything she wanted,
but she told me to bugger off.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.420
You know what I think?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.270
You faked that site.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.360
Because somewhere
in your twisted mind,

19:00.360 --> 19:05.350
it makes sense that the expert
on bigfoot would be killed by one.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.150
I knew it.

19:10.760 --> 19:11.970
She found him.

19:13.130 --> 19:14.900
The little bitch
found my bigfoot.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.800
Look, he's either crazy
or he's lying.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.860
I'd go with crazy,

19:20.870 --> 19:22.540
'cause it looks like
he's telling the truth.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.570
Tests on his prosthetic hook show
no trace of Anne's D.N.A.

19:25.570 --> 19:27.920
And his alibi checks out.
So it's not him.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.370
Well, it looks
like we're back to this guy

19:29.370 --> 19:30.800
as our number one suspect.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.660
Castle, could you please
take that down?

19:32.660 --> 19:33.580
You got it.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.760
The lab also was able to identify

19:35.760 --> 19:38.230
the glass shards we found
in our victim's head wound.

19:38.230 --> 19:39.460
It's from a camera lens.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.030
There was no camera
at the crime scene.

19:41.030 --> 19:42.330
Maybe our killer took it.

19:42.430 --> 19:45.640
Which would explain
why there are so few photos of bigfoot.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.240
I meant our human killer.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.080
Right.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.530
Let's re-canvass near that alleyway,

19:49.530 --> 19:50.930
see if we can find that camera.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.720
So I looked into the pendant
that Anne swallowed,

19:53.720 --> 19:54.980
and I found something strange.

19:54.980 --> 19:55.790
What?

19:55.790 --> 19:57.500
I talked to her friends and neighbors.

19:57.510 --> 20:00.330
The pendant wasn't Anne's.
It belonged to Justine Bolton,

20:00.350 --> 20:02.340
Anne's roommate
at Hudson University last year.

20:02.340 --> 20:04.840
Does the roommate have any idea
what Anne was doing with it?

20:04.840 --> 20:07.480
Uh, I'd love to ask her,
there's only one problem.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.090
Justine was murdered a year ago.

20:09.090 --> 20:09.970
And a year later,

20:09.970 --> 20:13.060
her pendant is found
in her murdered friend's stomach?

20:13.060 --> 20:15.160
That can't be a coincidence.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.140
What do we know
about Justine's murder?

20:17.140 --> 20:18.480
Well, I ordered up
her case files.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.890
They should be here
by the morning.

20:21.130 --> 20:23.600
Look, Castle, i don't care
how much research you do,

20:23.600 --> 20:27.040
you're not gonna convince me
that there's a bigfoot.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.070
I just follow the evidence

20:29.070 --> 20:31.360
and the insanely
large footprints.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.030
Is there anything
that you don't believe in?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.070
Sure, there is.
There's, um...

20:39.930 --> 20:41.380
Okay, well, what about you?

20:41.380 --> 20:44.120
If not bigfoot
or zombies or ghosts,

20:44.120 --> 20:45.320
what do you believe in?

20:45.320 --> 20:48.320
I just--I believe
in the everyday magic of life.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.450
I mean, things
that I can see and touch,

20:50.450 --> 20:51.940
Like, um,

20:51.940 --> 20:54.690
the green shoots that pop through
the snow in February,

20:54.690 --> 20:56.900
or the flatiron building, or...

20:57.380 --> 21:00.270
The way that I feel
when I hear Coltrane. It's...

21:00.270 --> 21:02.160
Now I can appreciate the everyday,

21:02.160 --> 21:05.050
but why not live in the possible?

21:05.050 --> 21:07.500
The world just doesn't have as
many mysteries anymore.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.350
There's no new
continents to explore.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.110
There's no more deepest,
darkest Africa.

21:11.110 --> 21:13.290
Everything's all mapped out
by satellites and sonar,

21:13.290 --> 21:17.870
yet, still,
people reach for the unknown.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.380
It's what makes us grow.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.820
Coltrane wouldn't have had
that saxophone

21:21.820 --> 21:23.900
if Antoine Sax hadn't imagined it.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.430
Isn't that
what separates us from, uh,

21:26.430 --> 21:28.130
say Moonshine?

21:28.530 --> 21:30.110
Well, you know, there is one...

21:31.780 --> 21:33.460
Inexplicable...

21:33.460 --> 21:37.090
Mysterious phenomenon
that I do believe in still.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.590
Us.

21:40.230 --> 21:41.130
What was that?

21:41.130 --> 21:42.120
Something set off my trap.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.130
You set a trap?

21:43.140 --> 21:45.610
- I've got you now, you super rats.
- What?

21:45.740 --> 21:47.780
No one steals from me.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.010
Alexis?

21:54.670 --> 21:56.390
What are you doing here? Mm!

22:04.230 --> 22:06.340
Yeah, she's still
not taking my calls.

22:06.340 --> 22:07.900
Well, can you blame her,
Castle?

22:07.900 --> 22:10.070
You practically turned her
into a smurf.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.870
Na'vi would be
a more contemporary reference.

22:11.870 --> 22:14.070
No, the point is, she lied to me.

22:14.070 --> 22:15.770
She looked me right in the eye

22:15.770 --> 22:17.120
and she blamed the borrowers.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.470
I'm sure she had a good reason.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.340
For what, not having food?

22:20.340 --> 22:22.080
I mean, I give her
a sizeable allowance.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.210
And if that's not enough,
she can always ask for more.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.050
Like I said, Castle,

22:25.050 --> 22:27.780
there are plenty of mysteries
in the everyday.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.770
Hey, Ryan,

22:28.770 --> 22:31.160
Has Justine Bolton's
murder file come in yet?

22:31.400 --> 22:32.870
She was attacked in the apartment

22:32.870 --> 22:34.560
that she shared with Anne Cardinal.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.050
The way she was choked
and bruised,

22:36.050 --> 22:37.820
looked like it was
a crime of passion.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.040
Do they have a suspect?

22:39.040 --> 22:40.380
Unfortunately, he fled,

22:40.380 --> 22:42.050
and he hasn't been seen
since the murder.

22:42.050 --> 22:44.350
Any chance he had long,
shaggy hair and he was 8 feet tall?

22:44.350 --> 22:45.810
Uh, no.
Sorry, Castle.

22:45.810 --> 22:48.120
It was Justine's boyfriend--
Kurt Wilson.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.480
He was the one that supposedly
found the body.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.490
He was a football player

22:51.490 --> 22:54.080
with a history of assaults
on and off the field.

22:54.090 --> 22:56.340
It looked like Justine
was trying to get away from him.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.280
The day that she was murdered,
she contacted the dean

22:58.280 --> 23:01.070
and told him that she was
dropping out of school

23:01.070 --> 23:02.830
even though she was
top of her class.

23:02.830 --> 23:04.180
By the time the cops realized

23:04.180 --> 23:06.840
that all roads led to Kurt Wilson,
he disappeared.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.890
How does Anne figure into this?

23:09.910 --> 23:11.170
Well, as her roommate,

23:11.170 --> 23:14.870
it looks like Anne took
Justine's death pretty hard.

23:14.870 --> 23:16.990
When I spoke to the lead detective,
he told me

23:16.990 --> 23:18.350
she came to him
a few months back

23:18.350 --> 23:19.970
and asked to see Justine's case file.

23:19.970 --> 23:21.890
He refused since it's
a pending murder case,

23:21.890 --> 23:22.840
But still, it means--

23:22.840 --> 23:24.700
Anne was looking
into Justine's murder.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.890
And a few months ago--
that's when Anne took time off school.

23:26.890 --> 23:29.270
So then maybe Anne wasn't
tracking down bigfoot.

23:29.270 --> 23:31.040
She was looking for Kurt Wilson.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.540
Maybe she found him.

23:33.690 --> 23:35.140
Canvass didn't turn up
Anne's camera,

23:35.140 --> 23:38.150
but the lab came back with
a serial number on that lens.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.180
Now it was made
for a specific model--

23:40.180 --> 23:41.610
A Wi-Fi-enable camcorder

23:41.610 --> 23:43.580
that's designed
to synch up to a cloud account.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.740
I checked.
Anne has a cloud account.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.230
Can we access it?

23:47.510 --> 23:50.040
Testing, one, two, three.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.330
Okay, good.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.580
Look at the time stamp.

23:54.580 --> 23:57.450
12:20 a.m. The night she died.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.900
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
- Yeah, but she's not in an alley.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.410
- Where the hell is she?
- He's after me. He's after me.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.090
Oh, please! No!

24:13.620 --> 24:16.750
So the attack took place
in the woods, not that alley.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.580
But what we need to find out
is where these woods are.

24:19.580 --> 24:21.700
Tech is trying to get
the geodata off that footage

24:21.710 --> 24:23.600
to see if we can pinpoint
the exact coordinates.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.240
But if she was attacked
in the woods somewhere,

24:25.240 --> 24:26.410
why move her to an alley?

24:26.410 --> 24:28.380
Because the killer was trying
to throw us off his trail.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.160
If Anne was looking for
Kurt Wilson,

24:30.160 --> 24:31.770
then the last thing
he would want to do

24:31.770 --> 24:33.980
is leave her body
near the same spot

24:33.980 --> 24:35.270
where he was hiding out.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.680
Unless she was looking for
someone else in those woods.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.860
Something with fur?

24:38.870 --> 24:41.520
What do we really see
of our killer in this video?

24:41.670 --> 24:43.460
He's dark, looming,

24:43.460 --> 24:45.410
powerful,
holding a primitive weapon.

24:45.410 --> 24:47.010
Castle, that is a person.

24:47.010 --> 24:51.140
All I see is the silhouette of a hulking,
humanoid form.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.860
If Darrell Meeks
and that one-armed Aussie were right

24:53.860 --> 24:56.340
and Anne did know
where bigfoot was,

24:56.830 --> 24:58.310
Well, that could be him
on that video.

24:58.310 --> 25:00.880
Then what, bigfoot carried
her body into the city on foot

25:00.880 --> 25:02.010
from wherever these woods are

25:02.010 --> 25:03.850
and left her in that alleyway?

25:03.850 --> 25:04.950
Well, you said yourself,

25:04.950 --> 25:06.560
Kurt Wilson wouldn't want to
leave Anne's body

25:06.570 --> 25:08.400
where he'd been hiding out.

25:08.730 --> 25:09.720
Why would bigfoot?

25:09.720 --> 25:12.750
Okay. Why don't you guys
circulate Wilson's photo

25:12.760 --> 25:14.190
to Anne's family and friends

25:14.190 --> 25:15.790
and see if anyone
has seen him around?

25:15.790 --> 25:17.260
Castle and I will talk to tech

25:17.260 --> 25:19.470
to see if we can figure out
where these woods are.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.690
I don't know. Maybe.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.000
If you rough him up a little,
he could be

25:28.020 --> 25:30.490
that homeless guy I saw hanging out
in the parking garage.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.440
When was that?

25:31.440 --> 25:33.030
Last week sometime.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.030
What was he doing?

25:34.030 --> 25:34.640
Nothing, man.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.500
He just looked like he was waiting.

25:37.010 --> 25:38.130
Well, we're gonna need, uh,

25:38.130 --> 25:39.490
security cam footage
of the garage.

25:39.490 --> 25:42.140
It's run by a separate company.
I'll get you their number.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.660
If Wilson knew that Anne was after him,

25:44.670 --> 25:46.820
he might have been following her,
preparing to kill her.

25:46.820 --> 25:47.950
I'll set up a canvass

25:47.950 --> 25:50.100
and pull traffic cam footage
from that area.

25:50.100 --> 25:50.670
Maybe we can get a hit on

25:50.670 --> 25:52.730
where he went
after he left that garage.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.370
Testing, one, two, three.

25:57.420 --> 25:58.300
Okay, good.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.850
The camera began synching
to her account

25:59.850 --> 26:01.250
right when she started filming.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.720
We couldn't pull any geodata,

26:02.730 --> 26:04.820
but the synch was routed
through her cell phone.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.700
It pinged
off this cell tower here.

26:06.710 --> 26:08.390
Are there any woods
near that tower?

26:08.390 --> 26:10.910
Yes, in a 10,000-acre
nature preserve...

26:10.910 --> 26:12.300
called Branch Cross.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.010
That's a perfect hangout
for bigfoot.

26:14.010 --> 26:14.840
Or the fugitive.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.030
Now is there any way
to narrow down

26:16.030 --> 26:18.220
where she was
when this was being filmed?

26:18.230 --> 26:19.320
Not as much as I'd like,

26:19.320 --> 26:20.840
but checked
with the forest service,

26:20.840 --> 26:22.390
the species of tree in the video...

26:22.390 --> 26:24.910
grow mostly in this
6-square-mile area.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.130
Also, between the moon's position
in the sky

26:27.130 --> 26:28.830
and the orientation
of the shadows,

26:28.830 --> 26:30.250
I can tell you
that she was moving

26:30.250 --> 26:32.030
in a southeasterly direction.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.550
Wow. She's good.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.170
Could you turn up the volume
on the video?

26:41.260 --> 26:43.870
- Do you guys hear that in the background?
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

26:43.990 --> 26:45.740
He's after me.
He's after me.

26:45.740 --> 26:47.170
Do you think you can
isolate that?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.190
That sounds like water.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.380
Are there any streams
or rivers nearby?

26:57.710 --> 26:58.470
Right there.

26:58.470 --> 26:59.850
She must have been near that creek,

26:59.850 --> 27:02.550
which gets us down
to a 2-square-mile area.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.110
Well, the good news is,
we have our crime scene.

27:05.110 --> 27:06.080
The bad news is,

27:06.090 --> 27:09.200
it's in 2 square miles
of remote wilderness

27:09.200 --> 27:11.230
with no access by road.

27:12.810 --> 27:14.440
You up for a hike?

27:14.900 --> 27:17.380
Oh, I'm well equipped
for a hike.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.830
What are you doing?

27:24.980 --> 27:26.690
Knocking on wood and vocalizing.

27:26.690 --> 27:28.560
It's how bigfoot communicates
over long distances.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.400
And how the real bigfoot hunters
lure him out.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.470
Yeah, well,
the real police don't do it

27:33.470 --> 27:35.990
so that our human fugitive
won't know that we're coming.

27:35.990 --> 27:37.120
Oh, trust me.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.730
If Kurt Wilson
has been hiding out here for a year,

27:39.730 --> 27:41.210
we are not gonna find him.

27:41.210 --> 27:42.590
Okay, we're close.

27:42.590 --> 27:47.050
GPS is showing that this is
the general area of the attack.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.330
We just need to find some landmarks.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.710
It happened
by this downed tree,

27:51.710 --> 27:53.370
So all we gotta do
is find the tree,

27:53.370 --> 27:55.340
and we've found our crime scene.

27:56.420 --> 27:59.640
Castle, Castle, please.
No more wookiee calls.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.160
It's not wookiee.
I'm not doing wookiee.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.370
I can't do wookiee.
Alexis does a really cute wookiee.

28:03.370 --> 28:05.230
Well, whatever you're doing,
could you stop?

28:05.230 --> 28:06.460
You scared it might work?

28:06.460 --> 28:08.290
No, I am scared
that I might murder you,

28:08.290 --> 28:09.810
and then I'll have
two crime scenes on my hands.

28:09.810 --> 28:12.030
You know, a lot
of highly respected individuals

28:12.030 --> 28:13.060
believe in bigfoot.

28:13.070 --> 28:15.010
Teddy Roosevelt wrote
about him in his journals.

28:15.010 --> 28:16.500
Jane Goodall has gone on record

28:16.500 --> 28:18.570
saying that she's open
to the possibility.

28:18.570 --> 28:20.460
And right now,
as we speak,

28:20.460 --> 28:21.390
Professors at Oxford

28:21.390 --> 28:24.140
are studying bigfoot D.N.A. samples.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.890
No, it is possible.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.670
You just have to be open to it...

28:30.690 --> 28:32.310
because at any moment,

28:32.310 --> 28:34.050
life can surprise you.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.140
Oh, that's not good for my knee.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.030
You okay?

28:51.030 --> 28:51.890
Yeah.

28:55.050 --> 28:56.410
Where are we?

28:57.230 --> 28:58.810
Some kind of trap.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.000
Which we've gotta get out of.

29:01.120 --> 29:01.910
Castle...

29:01.910 --> 29:03.890
Do you have anything
in your vest that can help us?

29:03.890 --> 29:05.700
Oh, yeah. Heck,
i got a guppie multi-tool,

29:05.700 --> 29:07.070
I've got a solar-powered
hand fan,

29:07.070 --> 29:08.860
got camo glasses,
built-in compass,

29:08.860 --> 29:10.320
Snake bite kit--

29:10.320 --> 29:11.510
So nothing?

29:11.520 --> 29:14.080
Well, not nothing.
I can build a fire.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.900
Oh, great.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.280
You know what, Castle?

29:21.280 --> 29:23.460
I can pull myself out
if you could boost me up.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.200
Well, then how am I gonna get out?

29:30.740 --> 29:31.920
I have a rope in the car.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.510
I was gonna hike back to get it.

29:33.510 --> 29:34.990
You're gonna
leave me here alone?

29:35.790 --> 29:37.350
Okay, whoa.
Just hold on a second.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.380
Let's just back up
and think about this.

29:39.380 --> 29:42.530
What is this pit doing out here
in the first place?

29:42.530 --> 29:43.730
Someone or...

29:43.730 --> 29:46.360
something had to build it.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.230
"Something," Castle?

29:47.230 --> 29:50.250
You think that bigfoot
came out here with a shovel?

29:51.570 --> 29:52.310
No, you're probably right.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.630
I don't think bigfoot built this.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.550
Yeah, some hunters
or poachers probably dug it up.

29:56.550 --> 29:58.590
Hunting what?
Look at the size of this thing.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.640
Maybe our fugitive built it
in case anyone came out here.

30:01.790 --> 30:03.600
I'm more comfort with the idea
of bigfoot building it.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.690
Come on, Castle.

30:04.690 --> 30:05.680
Why don't you pop a squat?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.500
- We'll pull a cheerleader move.
- Right.

30:07.930 --> 30:09.930
Shouldn't you be wearing
a short skirt for this?

30:10.430 --> 30:11.720
It's the move.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.260
You know, though,
this pit is kind of crudely built.

30:17.260 --> 30:20.730
And, uh, some primates
have been known to...

30:21.390 --> 30:22.690
make and...

30:22.690 --> 30:24.180
Oh, jeez! Castle!

30:24.220 --> 30:26.810
use tools to trap prey.

30:26.810 --> 30:29.330
Would you stand still? Hold me.

30:32.810 --> 30:33.900
Now.

30:39.700 --> 30:40.780
Yeah, I'm just saying,

30:40.780 --> 30:43.170
I don't want to end up
as bigfoot dinner.

30:43.570 --> 30:44.820
You know, Castle,

30:44.820 --> 30:46.970
there is a bit
of poetic justice in this.

30:46.970 --> 30:47.960
Poetic justice how?

30:47.960 --> 30:49.430
Well, I mean, think about it.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.150
You set a trap for Alexis,

30:51.150 --> 30:52.570
and now someone

30:52.570 --> 30:55.210
or something has set one for you.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.060
Promise me you'll come back.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.270
In case I don't make it.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.510
Oh, that's cute.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.900
But seriously, hurry back!

31:09.170 --> 31:10.350
'kay?

31:15.980 --> 31:16.990
What's that?

31:16.990 --> 31:19.140
Nothing. What do you got?

31:19.150 --> 31:20.250
Grab your coat.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.130
We got a hit on that photo
of Kurt Wilson.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.320
One of Anne's neighbors
just saw him

31:23.320 --> 31:24.690
go into her apartment.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.690
Hey, Wilson. NYPD.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.470
Not much
of a running back there, Wilson,

31:40.470 --> 31:42.150
But then,
you're out of training.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.750
All right. Let's go.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.800
We got him,
and he's not talking.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.950
What do you want us to do?

31:53.950 --> 31:55.880
Okay, check his clothes
for Anne's blood.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.430
How you guys doing
on the crime scene?

32:00.290 --> 32:01.630
We ran into a little snag,

32:01.630 --> 32:03.580
but when we find it,

32:03.590 --> 32:04.820
Hopefully we'll find evidence

32:04.820 --> 32:06.200
that leads us straight
to Kurt Wilson,

32:06.210 --> 32:07.920
and we won't need him to talk.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.810
Heh. Ah, spork...

32:15.810 --> 32:17.900
They all laughed at you.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.110
Beckett?

32:30.110 --> 32:33.230
Thank god you are back.
What took you so long?

32:39.380 --> 32:42.650
Ha ha ha ha ha. Okay.
Get me outta here now.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.840
Beckett?

32:46.040 --> 32:47.020
Kate...

33:01.520 --> 33:03.290
Help!

33:04.400 --> 33:05.950
Help!

33:11.830 --> 33:13.260
Please...

33:13.900 --> 33:15.400
Don't eat me.

33:22.470 --> 33:23.640
Police!

33:23.640 --> 33:25.240
Turn around!

33:25.780 --> 33:27.270
Put your hands up.

33:27.270 --> 33:27.930
Beckett, what are you doing?

33:27.930 --> 33:30.420
Are you crazy?
It can't understand you!

33:32.100 --> 33:33.390
Now!

33:38.010 --> 33:39.910
Whoa! Shoot it!

33:39.960 --> 33:41.810
Shoot it!
What are you waiting for?

33:42.350 --> 33:44.180
Oh, my back!

33:44.190 --> 33:45.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's talking.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.190
No!

33:49.370 --> 33:51.980
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

33:51.980 --> 33:53.430
Don't shoot!

33:53.430 --> 33:55.280
Please don't shoot.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.340
Don't shoot him.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.240
Well, this is a huge
disappointment.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.390
No, this is a big
misunderstanding.

34:01.390 --> 34:02.380
Is it?

34:02.380 --> 34:03.160
'cause those claws

34:03.160 --> 34:05.640
could've easily
caused Anne's injuries.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.270
What?
I'd never hurt Anne.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.800
Do you actually expect us
to believe that

34:09.800 --> 34:12.610
with you dressed up in this...
getup

34:12.610 --> 34:15.010
right in the same area
where she was attacked?

34:15.050 --> 34:17.020
Wait.
Sh-she was attacked here?

34:17.190 --> 34:18.760
I-I-I thought she was attacked
in the city.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.820
No.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.270
Okay.

34:22.270 --> 34:23.580
Okay, okay.

34:24.510 --> 34:25.370
This looks bad.

34:25.370 --> 34:28.389
Let me--let me just try and explain.
Okay?

34:28.389 --> 34:31.280
I knew that Anne
was coming out here on her own,

34:31.280 --> 34:34.630
and--and i-
i admit that I followed her.

34:34.630 --> 34:35.659
Why?

34:35.659 --> 34:37.480
Because I think she found bigfoot.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.850
Or maybe she just found
an idiot dressed up as bigfoot

34:39.850 --> 34:41.110
who then killed her.

34:41.110 --> 34:43.190
No! I didn't hurt Anne!

34:43.190 --> 34:44.960
Oh, okay.
So you just stalked her?

34:44.960 --> 34:46.409
Look, I just...

34:46.580 --> 34:49.739
I just wanted, just this once,

34:49.739 --> 34:52.520
to lay eyes
on this elusive beast.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.280
A-and that's why
i built this man-trap

34:55.290 --> 34:58.800
and--and--and I'm in this suit,
drenched in deer musk.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.920
Is that what that smell is?

34:59.920 --> 35:02.730
It's an attractant.
It--it lures them out.

35:02.730 --> 35:03.770
A-and it's working, too.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.650
I mean, a-about an hour ago,
i-i heard--

35:05.650 --> 35:08.490
I heard vocalizations and--
and knocking on wood.

35:08.490 --> 35:12.760
And--and those are--
are classic bigfoot mating calls.

35:12.760 --> 35:16.490
I also found some, uh,
half-eaten food and some scat.

35:16.490 --> 35:19.350
And not to mention, a tool

35:19.350 --> 35:22.280
that bigfoot used to club his prey.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.920
And there's blood on it.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.970
Wait a minute.
You saw a bloody club?

35:26.280 --> 35:27.380
Yeah.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.250
Show us where you found it.

35:31.940 --> 35:33.640
Do you recognize this?

35:34.280 --> 35:36.060
That's Anne Cardinal's blood.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.690
We're checking
your clothes for it, too,

35:37.690 --> 35:40.400
along with the dirt that is
gonna place you in the woods.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.490
You're just like those other cops.

35:42.490 --> 35:45.370
You'd rather make
your case than see the truth.

35:45.430 --> 35:46.990
And what is the truth, Kurt?

35:46.990 --> 35:49.100
I was living out in those woods,

35:49.110 --> 35:50.850
but Anne wasn't trying
to hunt me down.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.060
She came out there to help me,

35:52.060 --> 35:54.470
bring me food and supplies.

35:54.470 --> 35:57.540
Why would Anne help the man
that murdered her roommate?

35:57.590 --> 35:58.720
A few months ago,

35:58.720 --> 36:00.980
I came out of hiding
to find Anne.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.090
I told her I was innocent,
that I didn't kill Justine,

36:04.100 --> 36:06.260
and I begged her to look
into the case.

36:06.260 --> 36:09.240
And she agreed to because
she believed me.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.980
Yeah, well,
i'm a little more skeptical.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.250
I can vouch for that.

36:12.330 --> 36:15.110
You have a history of violence, Kurt.

36:15.110 --> 36:17.590
And it's pretty clear
that Justine dropped out

36:17.590 --> 36:19.670
and tried to break up with you,
so you killed her.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.210
Justine did not drop out
to get away from me.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.180
She and I were in love.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.400
When she told me
she was quitting Hudson,

36:29.680 --> 36:31.230
I decided to go, too.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.790
The two of us were planning
on transferring to another school.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.380
We'd even toured the campus

36:35.380 --> 36:37.550
at S.U.N.Y.
Binghamton the week before.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.570
And I'm sure they have
a record of that somewhere.

36:39.570 --> 36:42.310
If you weren't the reason why
Justine left Hudson,

36:42.310 --> 36:43.480
then what was?

36:43.480 --> 36:45.020
She never told me.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.770
She just said
that things weren't working out.

36:47.790 --> 36:49.940
But now I've spent
a lot of time

36:49.940 --> 36:50.850
thinking about that,

36:50.850 --> 36:52.600
and the only thing that makes sense

36:52.600 --> 36:55.490
is if there was someone there
that she was afraid of.

36:55.490 --> 36:56.240
Like who?

36:56.240 --> 36:58.770
A classmate, a professor--
I don't know.

36:58.770 --> 37:01.690
But I think Anne found out.

37:01.690 --> 37:04.180
Last week when I came
to see her at her work,

37:04.180 --> 37:07.210
she said that
she was close to having answers.

37:07.210 --> 37:08.970
And the next thing I know,
she's dead.

37:08.970 --> 37:11.940
So I figure whoever
did it killed Justine, too.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.790
And that--that's why I broke
into her apartment.

37:13.790 --> 37:16.200
I was looking for...
I don't know,

37:16.200 --> 37:18.520
Clues, answers, a-anything.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.420
The person that you think
killed Anne and Justine--

37:20.420 --> 37:21.970
Do you have any idea who it is?

37:21.970 --> 37:23.450
It had to be someone

37:23.450 --> 37:25.770
who could talk Justine
into opening her door.

37:25.770 --> 37:27.040
You know, someone she knew.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.490
It's the only reason that
they would steal her necklace.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.110
It wasn't worth anything.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.560
You wouldn't be referring
to a lapis pendant, would you?

37:35.730 --> 37:37.610
Justine never took it off.

37:37.970 --> 37:41.280
When I found her,
that pendant was gone.

37:41.310 --> 37:43.600
Whoever took it killed her.

37:44.010 --> 37:45.140
Kurt...

37:45.350 --> 37:47.470
Is this Justine's pendant?

37:50.570 --> 37:51.880
That's why Anne had it.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.090
The pendant is proof.
She found the real killer.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.000
It has to be someone
she spent time with recently.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.770
Someone she got close to.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.750
Professor Devlin.

38:03.470 --> 38:04.890
Can I help you, detective?

38:04.890 --> 38:06.830
As a matter of fact, you can.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.770
What can you tell us
about Justine Bolton?

38:10.250 --> 38:11.720
Uh, she was a student at Hudson

38:11.720 --> 38:14.030
who died rather tragically.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.110
Well, you knew her
as more than that.

38:16.110 --> 38:18.480
She took your introduction
to anthropology course

38:18.480 --> 38:19.510
her freshman year.

38:19.510 --> 38:22.330
Yes, she did, which made her
loss a personal one.

38:22.330 --> 38:23.840
But I fail to see what that--

38:23.840 --> 38:26.400
Were you aware that
after she took that course,

38:26.400 --> 38:28.370
she told her counselor
that she was afraid

38:28.370 --> 38:30.010
because someone on campus--

38:30.010 --> 38:31.880
she never said who...

38:32.710 --> 38:34.850
but someone was
obsessed with her?

38:34.980 --> 38:37.740
Well, no doubt she was talking
about her boyfriend--

38:37.740 --> 38:39.240
the young man who killed her.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.530
Ah, but she took the meeting
with her counselor

38:41.530 --> 38:43.650
before she met her boyfriend.

38:43.650 --> 38:44.980
But she had met you.

38:44.980 --> 38:47.260
You've had an odd career,
professor.

38:47.260 --> 38:50.480
You taught
at four schools in six years.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.240
So I made a few inquiries,
and there were intimations

38:53.240 --> 38:54.980
of stalking, sexual harassment,

38:54.980 --> 38:55.810
and even worse.

38:55.810 --> 38:58.240
All of which were false.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.220
And let me point out,

38:59.220 --> 39:01.580
no action
was ever taken against me.

39:01.580 --> 39:04.950
Justine had scheduled
a meeting with the dean

39:04.950 --> 39:06.500
on the day that she was killed

39:06.500 --> 39:08.650
to explain why she was leaving.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.640
You couldn't
let her take that meeting.

39:10.770 --> 39:12.460
If she did...

39:12.880 --> 39:15.360
your dirty history
would be exposed.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.970
You'd be finished.

39:16.970 --> 39:18.510
So you killed her.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.420
And being the predator
that you are,

39:20.420 --> 39:21.970
you took a souvenir--
her pendant.

39:21.970 --> 39:23.420
With all the suspicion
on Kurt Wilson,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.130
no one was looking at you.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.090
Until Anne came along.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.050
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.960
Anne found that pendant.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.680
She knew it was you.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.780
And when she went into the woods,
you followed her.

39:35.780 --> 39:38.020
What woods?
I wasn't in any woods.

39:38.020 --> 39:39.090
We checked your phone records.

39:39.090 --> 39:41.670
Your cell pinged
the same tower as Anne's did

39:41.670 --> 39:43.080
around the time
that she was attacked.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.080
That places you at the crime scene.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.730
We also found a club
with Anne's blood on it

39:47.730 --> 39:49.390
and someone else's D.N.A.

39:49.390 --> 39:51.410
And based on the look
that you're giving me right now,

39:51.410 --> 39:53.740
I'm pretty damn sure it's yours.

39:57.370 --> 39:58.360
So, Castle,

39:58.360 --> 40:00.650
are you disappointed
that there's no bigfoot after all?

40:00.650 --> 40:02.700
Well, I'm not so sure there isn't.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.290
I'm thinking maybe
he's out there somewhere,

40:04.290 --> 40:06.650
and if he is,
i hope to see him one day.

40:06.650 --> 40:09.400
Preferably from a safe distance.

40:10.990 --> 40:13.920
Thank you...
for finishing what Anne started.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.690
Because of you guys,

40:14.690 --> 40:16.530
Justine's killer will pay
for what he did to her,

40:16.530 --> 40:18.680
and, uh, I'm a free man.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.370
So what's next for you?

40:21.240 --> 40:23.270
I'm going
to continue Anne's work.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.980
You're gonna research bigfoot, why?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.560
Well, when she suggested
i hide out in those woods,

40:28.560 --> 40:30.610
she told me I'd have
company out there.

40:31.780 --> 40:33.210
She was right.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.850
Did you hear that?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.250
I gotta go and get my outfit.

40:43.730 --> 40:44.850
Hey.

40:45.740 --> 40:49.480
You, um... you still got a little...
on your...

40:49.480 --> 40:52.250
I'm--I'm so sorry about that.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.790
Do you know
how humiliating that was?

40:54.790 --> 40:57.660
I swear,
i had no idea it was you.

40:57.660 --> 41:00.490
But, Alexis,
why were you stealing food?

41:00.700 --> 41:02.500
Because I ran out of money.

41:02.780 --> 41:05.290
How could you have possibly spent
all your money unless--

41:05.290 --> 41:07.020
Wait. No. Are you...

41:07.140 --> 41:08.260
Are--are you
in some kind of trouble?

41:08.260 --> 41:09.670
No, I didn't spend it.
I gave it away.

41:09.670 --> 41:11.530
Invested it, really.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.710
Invested in what?

41:14.440 --> 41:16.550
My friend Jonah at school
has a crowdfunding campaign

41:16.560 --> 41:18.660
to plant bamboo forests
on the roof of skyscrapers

41:18.660 --> 41:20.360
to help clean the air.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.780
Well, why didn't you j
ust come to me?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.520
Because I didn't want the speech.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.430
I don't--what speech?

41:25.710 --> 41:27.240
That people like us
need to be careful

41:27.250 --> 41:28.650
with the kind
of money we have.

41:28.650 --> 41:29.900
People might try
to take advantage.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.060
Oh, that speech. Yeah.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.010
Dad, you believe in all these
unbelievable things,

41:35.010 --> 41:37.760
like bigfoot, and I don't judge.

41:37.760 --> 41:41.010
But... I believe in people
and what they can accomplish.

41:41.010 --> 41:42.670
I believe in Jonah
and his vision,

41:42.670 --> 41:44.080
and I wanted to support him.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.870
I think he could make
a real difference in the world.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.590
And, okay,
so maybe it was stupid

41:48.590 --> 41:50.240
to give him all of my allowance,

41:50.240 --> 41:52.520
But I am not the first person
to do something stupid

41:52.520 --> 41:53.810
for something they believe in.

41:53.810 --> 41:55.820
No. No, you're not.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.740
Matter of fact, it's a...
bit of a family trait.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.440
But... you do owe me

42:03.440 --> 42:04.750
a chateaubriand.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.350
So... let's go to Le Cirque.

42:08.670 --> 42:11.770
And then, uh, call this Jonah guy,
have him meet us.

42:11.770 --> 42:14.090
I'd like to hear about
how he's gonna change the world.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.350
Really?

42:15.580 --> 42:17.240
I believe in people, too.

42:17.570 --> 42:19.310
And borrowers.

42:19.310 --> 42:20.780
And bigfoot.
