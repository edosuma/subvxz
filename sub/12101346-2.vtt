00:09.510 --> 00:13.514
I think about every episode as being
a different chapter in a travel narrative.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.934
-So what do I do?
-Just go left. Right here.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.185
-Here!
-Here?

00:20.145 --> 00:22.439
The book itself is very patriarchal,

00:22.523 --> 00:25.734
because the main character
is not the most empathetic of individuals.

00:25.817 --> 00:29.488
And he's somebody who wants to sort of
rip his family away from the clutches

00:29.571 --> 00:32.406
of the 20th century and all
of its commercialism and materialism,

00:32.491 --> 00:33.784
and take them to a new Eden.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.994
We're gonna chase the weather
down to Mexico.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.746
-To where?
-Mexico.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.374
Sip tequila, go swimming, go fishing.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.376
You don't eat enough fish.
You need to eat more fish.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.919
We don't even know anyone there.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.005
The TV show employs this couple,
this family of four,

00:47.089 --> 00:49.675
not making a choice to leave,
but they're on the run.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.846
Neil Cross is the shepherd
and guardian of the scripts.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.390
He came up with a really good device

00:56.473 --> 00:58.225
of basically knowing
that there needed to be

00:58.308 --> 01:02.396
something at the backs of the Foxes,
meaning this government agency

01:02.479 --> 01:04.815
that is sort of chasing them
out of the United States.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.441
Fan out!

01:06.525 --> 01:07.568
Let's go.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.864
Visually what we've tried to do is to show

01:11.947 --> 01:14.992
the two very different worlds.
One that was very clean and florescent

01:15.075 --> 01:18.287
and then an outside world,
in the case of where they're headed,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.914
that was much more unordered,
unpredictable.

01:20.998 --> 01:25.502
The colors, more of a kind of blend
of different influences and sources.

01:27.671 --> 01:31.758
We're more often than not quick to judge
what a migrant is and in this instance,

01:31.842 --> 01:36.263
it's a white, nuclear, American family,
going into a wholly different culture.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.684
We take them from, "This is
their environment, this is their life,"

01:40.767 --> 01:42.603
and we take it all away from them.

01:42.686 --> 01:43.687
We gotta go!
