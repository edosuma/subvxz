00:01.234 --> 00:03.903
(crickets chirping
and wind rustling)

00:17.617 --> 00:19.352
(eerie music)

00:56.289 --> 01:00.427
(heavy breathing and
moaning on television)

01:17.510 --> 01:20.246
(dramatic music)

01:26.052 --> 01:30.223
(heavy breathing and
moaning on television)

01:34.727 --> 01:38.898
(muffled speaking and
moaning on television)

01:55.048 --> 01:58.117
(crickets chirping)

02:03.690 --> 02:06.593
(knocking on door)

02:19.339 --> 02:21.074
- You know what
fucking time it is?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.443
- Yeah, I'm sorry
man, I got dislayed.

02:23.443 --> 02:24.277
Delayed.

02:25.879 --> 02:26.880
You alright?

02:28.014 --> 02:28.848

02:29.449 --> 02:29.816

02:31.017 --> 02:32.018

rest of your shit,

house, didn't ya?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.094
- Well, I need an
excuse to go back.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.996
- Yeah. Right. Okay.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.298
- She'll be begging me to come
back after she calms down.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.599
This is just temporary.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.601
- Yeah, right, okay.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.038
- Are we gonna go in or?

02:53.473 --> 02:55.174
- You know, I kicked my
flat mate out cause of you?

02:55.174 --> 02:56.676
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

02:56.676 --> 02:58.244
- Well why did you do that?

02:58.244 --> 02:59.679
- Fuckin' told me you were
fuckin' kicked to the curb

02:59.679 --> 03:00.914
what was I supposed to do?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.348
- Not evict your
housemate, Wendel,

03:02.348 --> 03:03.883
I just wanted to use your couch.

03:03.883 --> 03:05.718
- What fuckin' happens if
Leah kicks you out again?

03:05.718 --> 03:07.453
Where you gonna go, huh?

03:07.453 --> 03:08.988
Where you gonna go?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.457
- As long as I can prove to
her I'm not a user anymore.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.825
She'll be all right,
it'll be fine.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.661
- Just fucking
move on, all right?

03:14.661 --> 03:16.062
Move on.

03:16.062 --> 03:19.666
Any man with balls would
just move on, all right?

03:19.666 --> 03:20.500
Be a man.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.806
- I'm not working, who else
am I gonna fuck for rent?

03:26.806 --> 03:28.007
- Don't worry about the rent,

03:28.007 --> 03:30.209
I'll pay your share, all right?

03:30.209 --> 03:31.611
- You sure?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.112
- As long as you're
clean and tidy.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.714
- I owe you big time for
letting me crash here, man,

03:34.714 --> 03:37.050
but I can't outstay my welcome.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.052
- You can stay as long as
you want, I don't care.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.620
- Cheers, man.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.322
I owe you one.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.724
- What happened to your neck?

03:46.159 --> 03:49.862
- Yeah, she really wanted
me out of the house, eh.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.865
- C'mon, let's get fucked up.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.101
- I was just thinking that.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.838
- What'd you do anyway?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.175
You fuck her mom?

04:02.175 --> 04:04.444
- I've got standards, mate.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.415
(dramatic music)

04:10.950 --> 04:11.784
- Wanna break from study?

04:11.784 --> 04:12.619
- No.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.288
- Come on, you don't even
know what I'm gonna ask.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.023
- What're you gonna ask?

04:17.023 --> 04:20.627
- Wanna come get my
car back from Wendel's?

04:20.627 --> 04:21.461
- No.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.230
- Please?

04:24.230 --> 04:25.732
- Don't harass me.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.434
Go get it yourself.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.437
- Please, I want
you to come with me.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.905
- Why do you want me to come?

04:32.905 --> 04:36.643
I can't like, what do you expect
me to do, like protect you?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.212
- I'm not asking
you to protect me,

04:39.212 --> 04:42.048
I'd just feel more
better if you came with.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.350
- More better.
- It's not far.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.020
- Yeah, well how far is not far?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.189
- You know where
Bermuda Ave. is?

04:50.189 --> 04:52.191
- Don't touch my stuff, yeah.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.926
- 10, 15 minutes.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.162
We can taxi it if you want.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.566
- No, it's fine, we'll walk.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.301
I feel like I'm
getting cabin fever.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.136
- Great.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.004
Lace up.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.842
Anyway, lesson learnt,
don't go try helping people.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.044
- Were you in love or something?

05:11.044 --> 05:12.178
- No.

05:12.178 --> 05:14.047
- What a loser,
doesn't even own a car.

05:14.047 --> 05:14.881
- He does.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.349
- He does?

05:16.349 --> 05:18.051
- Mine was just meant
to be for collateral.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.252
- For what?

05:19.252 --> 05:20.153
- You know, just bowl
a few people over.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.021
(laughs)

05:22.021 --> 05:24.390
Yeah, just a couple days, just.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.993
Couple of deals
going on, you know?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.728
- Yeah
- Yeah, you don't need it?

05:28.728 --> 05:29.662
- No, I don't.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.964
But, I need it back for uni.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.767
So just two days
- Yeah, cool.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.702
- Promise?

05:35.702 --> 05:37.337
- [Wendel] Yeah, I promise.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.171
Promise.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.473
- Yeah, you can have it
- Sick.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.141
- I did nothing illegal, okay?

05:42.141 --> 05:43.609
I loaned a car to a friend.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.978
- Yeah, so he could drive
his grandmother to the store.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.848
- Wendel had a dream of
starting up a hair salon, okay?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.350
He just needed some extra
funds to kick start it.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.185
I had to help.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.486
- You didn't have to.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.420
- Plus, in a
relationship, you support

05:54.420 --> 05:55.955
your partner no matter what.

05:55.955 --> 05:56.756
- It's not even your car to
do such a shitty thing with.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.124
- Whose is it?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.892
- Mom and Dad's.

05:59.892 --> 06:00.693
- Yeah.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.596
Do you know anything about
being in a relationship?

06:03.596 --> 06:04.964
Have you ever been with a man?

06:04.964 --> 06:07.266
- Oh, maybe I don't like men.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.367
- Yes you do.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.903
- You're shameless.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.513
(gasps)

06:20.513 --> 06:24.117
(rap music)

06:24.117 --> 06:27.053
(knocking on door)

06:33.426 --> 06:34.527
- Yeah, that's good, uh.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.629
Wendel's not home.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.297
- Oh, that's alright.

06:38.297 --> 06:39.265
I just, I'm glad you're here.

06:39.265 --> 06:40.900
I just came to collect my car.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.401
- Yeah, you can have a look
in the garage if you want.

06:42.401 --> 06:43.236
- Yeah?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.070
Cool Thanks.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.543
Takes mine, leaves his.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.011
- Maybe yours is
parked on the road.

06:52.011 --> 06:55.081
- I walked here,
it's not on the road.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.016
- I'll call him.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.317
- Where is he?

06:58.317 --> 06:59.719
Work?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.554
- I don't know,
probably work, yeah.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.156
I haven't seen him.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.259
- Fucking carjacker.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.660
- He wouldn't steal it.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.928
What has he been saying to you?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.096
- We haven't spoken in weeks.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.164
- Weeks?

07:11.164 --> 07:11.998
- Mhmm.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.271
Anyways, I better go,
my sister's waiting.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.806
Thanks, though.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.475
- You know I can give you
and your sister a ride home.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.310
- Sounds good.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.511
- No.

07:25.511 --> 07:26.445
Sanja, call a taxi,
I'm not getting

07:26.445 --> 07:27.914
in the car with some druggie.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.382
- Then walk, all right?

07:29.382 --> 07:32.118
You've never met the guy, Vesna,
so stop making assumptions.

07:32.118 --> 07:32.952
Okay?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.322
- How you gettin' around?

07:36.322 --> 07:37.657
You'd need a car in Perth.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.258
- I know, and I'll
need one tonight

07:39.258 --> 07:41.160
or I'll probably lose my job.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.295
- What do you do?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.430
- Just work at a club part-time.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.265
- And no, it's not stripping.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.800
- Wasn't thinking it.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.736
- What have you got
against exotic dancers?

07:50.736 --> 07:53.072
- Nothing, it suits you.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.174
Could be your calling in life.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.609
- Sorry, Levi.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.511
- Ah it was only a joke.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.479
- Yeah.

08:02.448 --> 08:06.319
- Yeah, um, I'll let
you know about your car.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.388
I'll see what's going
on next time I see him.

08:09.388 --> 08:10.223
- Do you have my number?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.457
- [Levi] Nah .

08:11.457 --> 08:12.658
- If it doesn't get
returned tonight,

08:12.658 --> 08:14.861
Sanja's going to report
it stolen to police.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.130
- Then walk home, Vesna.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.899
I wouldn't rat.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.967
- I would've.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.005
I'll get your number
and I'll let you know

08:26.005 --> 08:29.041
as soon as I know
what is happening.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.643
- Thanks.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.211
So, do you live with Wendel now?

08:32.211 --> 08:36.015
- Nah, I'm just in between
homes at the moment.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.650
Gonna find my own place soon.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.517
- Oh, where at?

08:38.517 --> 08:40.052
- Anywhere but there.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.823
Me and him are just
totally different.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.491
- That's a positive.

08:48.094 --> 08:52.265
(clanging metal and beat boxing)

08:54.667 --> 08:57.336
- [Wendel] How good's
this? I did well.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.008
Bit small.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.009
Maybe I should've
got another one.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.243
- Nah, it's heaps.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.013
- Yeah, yeah, it's heaps.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.682
- Have you considered
giving Sanja's car back?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.918
- Nah, it's a gift.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.987
- She came looking
man, she wants it.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.589
- Her dad will
buy her a new one.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.990
She's a pampered mutt.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.359
- Is it still hers on paper?

09:20.359 --> 09:24.463
- Well, technically my
ownership isn't official.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.564
- What if it gets
reported stolen

09:25.564 --> 09:26.732
and your house gets searched?

09:26.732 --> 09:27.967
- [Wendel] No chance.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.936
- [Levi] There is a chance.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.737
- Look, I'm not anyone's
radar, all right?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.539
I'm not fucking worried,
why should you be?

09:33.539 --> 09:35.441
- Confidence comes easy when
you've never been caught.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.909
I just think you're
making a mistake.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.178
- [Wendel] Stop thinking,
it'll give you cancer.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.419
So.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.588
Has Leah come begging yet?

09:49.789 --> 09:51.190
- Nah, I ended it.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.593
Well, I'm going to, that is if

09:54.593 --> 09:57.863
your initial offer still stands.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.899
- [Wendel] Two things if
you want to stay, all right?

09:59.899 --> 10:01.434
- Okay.
- Two rules.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.403
Keep it clean, and keep it sexy.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.740
- Mate, I'll make
the house sparkle.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.809
- Well you made
progress today, bro.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.544
Why don't you come out tonight?

10:11.544 --> 10:12.712
- [Levi] You going out tonight?

10:12.712 --> 10:14.113
Where at?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.047
- Going away party.

10:15.047 --> 10:16.215
- [Levi] When?

10:18.918 --> 10:20.252
- At seven o'clock.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.420
- Wait, when?

10:21.420 --> 10:22.421
- Seven.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.522
- It's eight.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.692
- Nah, it's seven.

10:26.692 --> 10:30.029
- But I can't make
it, I gotta job hunt.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.904
- [Wendel] Ah,
shit, it is eight!

10:38.904 --> 10:42.241
Yeah, you're right,
it is eight o'clock.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.345
Listen, you reckon you could
clean this pig sty up for us

10:46.345 --> 10:47.646
and stack the dishwasher?

10:47.646 --> 10:48.481
- Yeah.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.585
- Why don't you
come out, all right?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.286
What are you going
to do here, jerk off?

10:54.286 --> 10:55.121
- Maybe.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.758
- Yeah, well don't jizz
on my sheets, all right?

10:58.758 --> 11:02.395
- I told you I'm
looking for some jobs.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.462
- But you'll clean this up?

11:03.462 --> 11:04.296
- Yeah.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.433
- Alright

11:13.172 --> 11:15.074
(loud thundering)

11:15.074 --> 11:17.643
- Don't be so generous
with your car next time.

11:17.643 --> 11:18.711
- Exactly.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.212
- How 'bout yours, Dad?

11:20.212 --> 11:22.348
- Same policy, darling, sorry.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.083
- [Mom] Take the bus.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.351
- They're filthy, no way.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.386
I hate the public
transport system.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.955
The seats are dirty with
grime and blood and semen.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.024
- Oh, don't be revolting.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.462
- How about, all right,
remember that news report

11:36.462 --> 11:37.863
where a lady gave her
husband a hand job

11:37.863 --> 11:39.765
on the train at peak hour?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.233
- What?

11:41.233 --> 11:43.335
- In front of a bunch of
school kids and elderly folk.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.637
- No way.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.639
- It's a true story.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.175
- I'm never using the public
transport system in Perth.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.277
It's not Tokyo or
Singapore or Hong Kong,

11:51.277 --> 11:52.812
there's a massive difference.

11:52.812 --> 11:53.979
- [Mom] You've never been
to any one of those cities.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.649
- So, I'm well informed
about the world.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.318
- How about I give you a lift
and you can get a taxi home?

11:59.318 --> 12:02.688
Or do you have issues
with taxis as well?

12:02.688 --> 12:04.123
- They're huge creeps.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.291
Haven't you heard of
them sexually assaulting

12:05.291 --> 12:06.892
drunk women late at night?

12:06.892 --> 12:10.896
I'm not catching a taxi by
myself at three am, thank you.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.433
- One word, mace, and just
don't get drunk Sunny.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.668
- [Sanja] Wasn't planning to.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.470
- I can't do that.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.407
- [Sanja] Looks like I'll
have to call in sick.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.946
(sniffs)

12:29.115 --> 12:31.884
(dramatic music)

12:51.337 --> 12:52.171
- Mine?

12:53.405 --> 12:54.673
Is it clean and everything?

12:54.673 --> 12:55.975
-  I'd eat dinner off it.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.077
- I can get a lift over
there tomorrow morning.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.845
- Or I could easily
drop it off to you.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.814
- Oh, you're a doll.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.315
What time suits?

13:03.315 --> 13:04.984
- How does tonight sound?

13:04.984 --> 13:06.252
You're not in bed or anything?

13:06.252 --> 13:07.453
- No.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.522
- Just the sooner
the better, I reckon.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.423
- Yeah, yeah, come over.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.925
- [Levi] Too easy.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.562
(upbeat music)

13:29.208 --> 13:32.645
- The exterior seems
to be in good nick.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.415
Not bad inside, either.

13:42.688 --> 13:43.522
Shit head.

13:46.158 --> 13:50.162
I should crush these and
send Wendel the pieces.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.332
- Do they look better on me?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.234
- Much better.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.203
You're nothing like
your brother, are you?

13:57.203 --> 13:59.605
- Yeah, I think we
have different fathers.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.840
- Does he know you've done this?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.677
Cause he hasn't replied to
any of my calls or texts.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.478
- Not exactly.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.314
- You went behind
has back for me?

14:08.314 --> 14:10.316
- Well, I think you
deserved your own car.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.784
- What will you tell him?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.352
He'll beat your ass.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.387
- I have no idea.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.889
You got any ideas?

14:18.157 --> 14:18.991
- Truth.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.564
- I'll have to spin some story.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.467
Hope he doesn't
kick me out for it.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.172
- Come inside for a drink?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.274
Think of something.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.243
- Why haven't you left yet?

14:37.243 --> 14:38.844
- Never seems to pan out.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.379
I wanted to.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.213
I will.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.183
After uni.

14:45.918 --> 14:48.020
- When do you finish?

14:48.020 --> 14:49.188
- If I finish.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.459
- Yeah, I didn't finish either.

14:53.459 --> 14:56.161
- That makes me feel better.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.396
- Yeah.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.498
I'm thinking about
going back but.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.367
Nothing else to do.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.201
- Yeah.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.977
(Sanja laughs)

15:13.145 --> 15:16.649
- This is a pretty good
wine you've got here.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.352
- Thanks, my dad has
a whole collection.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.520
- Yeah?

15:21.520 --> 15:22.454
- Yeah, I don't
really understand wine

15:22.454 --> 15:24.023
I just sort of picked this one.

15:24.023 --> 15:26.558
- Do you know expensive
wine is after a few years?

15:26.558 --> 15:28.027
- No, I don't know.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.563
I think this one might be
like 1980 bottle or something.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.534
- They're worth like a
couple of thousand you know?

15:35.534 --> 15:36.468
- Are they?

15:36.468 --> 15:38.504
- If it's a decent bottle, yeah.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.139
- Tastes all right.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.473
- It's pretty good.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.776
Sure he won't be angry
for you for opening it?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.844
- No, he'll be all right.

15:47.012 --> 15:49.348
- [Levi] No plans,
what about you?

15:49.348 --> 15:50.482
- Sleep.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.317
- Oh yeah?

15:51.317 --> 15:53.018
Sounds exciting.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.186
- I'm not always this boring.

15:54.186 --> 15:55.788
- No?
- No.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.390
- Have a good sleep then.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.558
- How you getting home?

15:59.558 --> 16:00.993
- Uh, with my legs.

16:00.993 --> 16:04.163
- I can drop you a
street or two over.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.034
(crickets chirping)

16:10.336 --> 16:12.237
How badly did
Wendel drive my car?

16:12.237 --> 16:13.806
- Oh, not as bad as me.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.640
- Oh yeah?

16:16.075 --> 16:18.677
- Yeah, I just did a couple
of reverse doughies in it.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.546
- Better not have.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.215
- Nah, I just drove it to yours.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.286
- [Sanja] It's kinda
early, don't you reckon?

16:27.286 --> 16:28.220
- [Levi] Yeah.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.189
- [Sanja] I'm wide awake.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.958
Wanna go somewhere?

16:32.958 --> 16:33.892
- Yeah, but it's kinda hard when

16:33.892 --> 16:35.327
you're trying to be invisible.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.562
- Well, we'll get
something to eat

16:36.562 --> 16:38.163
somewhere at a quiet place.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.366
- Ah, I'm not really hungry.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.735
Let's just cruise around.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.904
(upbeat techno music)

16:56.915 --> 16:59.651
(dramatic music)

17:31.083 --> 17:34.086
- [Sanja] You need to leave
before my parents wake up.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.989
Otherwise that'd be awkward.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.127
(dramatic music)

17:46.165 --> 17:46.999
- Oi, Lee!

17:46.999 --> 17:48.500
Get up!

17:48.500 --> 17:49.334
Get up!

17:51.370 --> 17:53.338
You hear anything last night?

17:53.338 --> 17:55.474
Did you see anything?
- What?

17:55.474 --> 17:58.444
- Didn't hear anything
did you, ya piece of shit.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.878
The cars been stolen.

17:59.878 --> 18:00.679
- Nobody stole the thing.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.448
- It's fucking gone.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.649
Fuck they musta got inside.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.251
To fuckin gain
access to the garage.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.587
- [Levi] After you left, Sanja
came back around last night.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.822
I had to let her take it.
- What?

18:09.822 --> 18:11.156
- She's was on the way
to the cop shop man,

18:11.156 --> 18:13.258
she was gonna dob you in.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.528
- Sanja wasn't gonna
fucking dob me in,

18:16.528 --> 18:17.729
what are you talking about?

18:17.729 --> 18:18.664
- That's what she said, man.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.898
- [Wendel] She was in on it.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.333
- That's not what
she said to me, man.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.801
- You're bullshitting!
- Why would I?

18:22.801 --> 18:24.670
- Sanja wouldn't do that.
- She fucking did man.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.804
- You're bullshitting me
- I wouldn't do that.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.039
- Don't fucking bullshit me.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.707
- I wouldn't do
that to you, man.

18:28.707 --> 18:29.741
Fuck.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.743
- Don't do that in here.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.580
- Fucking hell, man.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.385
- Are you fucking her?

18:41.820 --> 18:42.888
- Little bit.

18:45.491 --> 18:49.094
Let's go outside
and talk about this.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.863
- You just lost me three grand.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.164
- How much?

18:52.164 --> 18:53.265
- Four grand.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.235
- Were you going to take it
to a chop shop or something?

18:56.235 --> 18:59.638
- And you didn't stack the
dishwasher like I asked.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.440
- I'll give you the money
if you're hurtin' for cash.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.908
(laughs)

19:02.908 --> 19:05.244
- Yeah, says the big shot with
two cents to his name, eh?

19:05.244 --> 19:06.512
- [Levi] Sorry.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.622
I would've told you sooner,

19:16.622 --> 19:19.491
I was just waiting for you
to move on, find someone new.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.560
- Coulda woulda shoulda.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.528
- Are you with someone?

19:22.528 --> 19:23.362
(Wendel laughs)

19:23.362 --> 19:25.197
- You'll want her next.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.131
- I've never done this.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.466
You know I've never done this.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.668
I've never wanted any of
your previous partners,

19:29.668 --> 19:31.203
especially the men.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.372
- You always wanted
what I had, bro.

19:33.372 --> 19:36.675
Ever since we were kids you
always tried to copy me.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.710
Tried to be better than me.

19:38.710 --> 19:42.781
I'd get a Matchbox car,
you'd get a Matchbox car.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.185
I'd get a cat's eye marble.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.119
- You're livin' in the past.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.954
- You'd get a cat's eye marble.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.188
- Take it as a compliment.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.690
- Fucking emperor.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.696
Given I'm a man of taste.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.032
If you wanted my
seconds, why not Tash?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.266
Why not Monique?

20:01.266 --> 20:02.901
- Sanja's different.
- Someone half decent.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.102
- Sanja's different.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.637
- Different what, how?

20:05.637 --> 20:06.838
Better BO?

20:06.838 --> 20:08.206
- She doesn't stink.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.708
- I beg to differ.

20:11.476 --> 20:14.513
- The thing is, I've
always liked her.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.616
Ever since we first met I have.

20:17.616 --> 20:20.886
- Fuck, you shoulda
told me a year ago.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.189
Fucking too meek as usual.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.023
- How woulda that looked?

20:25.023 --> 20:26.391
You were with her then.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.193
- You coulda saved
me a lot of pain.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.461
Lot of pain.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.462
Lot of pain.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.298
- We all good?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.533
Does it bother you or?

20:34.533 --> 20:36.735
- Doesn't bother me.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.803
Does it bother you?

20:37.803 --> 20:40.706
I mean, I've been up there.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.542
Up near her vital
organs and shit.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.044
- Not what I heard.

20:47.779 --> 20:49.748
- What did you hear?

20:49.748 --> 20:52.517
- Nah, nothing,
I'm just kidding.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.860
- Have you seen my sunnies?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.362
- There, they're on your shirt.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.731
- Oh no, the other ones.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.332
The good ones.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.401
The T1000s, the Aviators.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.404
- Oh, I haven't seen em.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.773
- I swear I had em.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.008
Swear I had em.

21:17.643 --> 21:18.810
Swear I had em

21:27.185 --> 21:29.454
Did you make her scream?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.822
- I'm not telling you.

21:30.822 --> 21:33.425
(moans loudly)

21:34.660 --> 21:36.728
(laughs)

21:36.728 --> 21:37.929
- I made her scream.

21:37.929 --> 21:40.098
- Good talk as usual, bro.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.768
- Don't get all offended.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.770
Just having a laugh
for fucks sake.

21:44.770 --> 21:45.904
(laughs)

21:45.904 --> 21:47.873
I'm cool with it.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.542
I just think you're a tad dirty.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.179
- The heart wants
what the heart wants.

21:54.179 --> 21:55.414
- I think you need to replace

21:55.414 --> 21:57.549
that word heart
with something else.

21:57.549 --> 22:00.819
- I don't care about sex
that much for the most part.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.487
- You're probably
doing it wrong,

22:02.487 --> 22:03.955
or playing for the wrong team.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.357
- I couldn't be with a
man, I don't know how you

22:05.357 --> 22:08.326
do it switching back and forth.

22:08.326 --> 22:12.497
- Lately I've been
getting back into females.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.133
Guys are cool, they understand
the male body a lot more,

22:15.133 --> 22:18.637
I reckon, than 95% of
females, that's for sure.

22:18.637 --> 22:22.341
- If men are so good, why do
you even bother with women?

22:22.341 --> 22:26.078
- They're fucking crazy,
I fucking love them.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.081
Til they start
trying to change you.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.316
Sanja's no fucking
different, all right?

22:31.316 --> 22:32.517
She's not special.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.487
- What happened
between you and her?

22:36.922 --> 22:38.423
- Not telling you.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.199
She's a brat, selfish,
drama queen, controlling.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.203
Oh yeah yeah, yeah
you fucking wait.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.370
You wait.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.206
- People change.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.741
People change.

22:55.741 --> 22:56.942
- What, you think
you're the one capable

22:56.942 --> 22:59.678
of making the other
person change?

22:59.678 --> 23:01.213
You're the bitch, yeah?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.514
- Someone's gotta be the bitch.

23:02.514 --> 23:05.016
- You two are perfect
for each other then.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.319
- [Levi] Did you really think
that the car was a gift?

23:07.319 --> 23:09.388
- [Wendel] What does it matter?

23:09.388 --> 23:13.558
- [Levi] Can you call her
and say you thought it was?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.896
I was doing all right
with one til they asked

23:17.896 --> 23:19.531
for proof of my qualifications.

23:19.531 --> 23:20.966
- [Wendel] What qualifications?

23:20.966 --> 23:23.502
- [Levi] The fake ones
that I listed on my resume.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.170
You'll still get
your four grand.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.205
Sanja's gonna ask her
dad to get me work.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.940
- [Wendel] You don't
owe me any money, bro.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.175
- [Levi] Since when?

23:30.175 --> 23:33.044
- You were right
about Sanja's car.

23:34.312 --> 23:36.515
I'm sorry for
hounding you about it

23:36.515 --> 23:38.784
first thing in the morning.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.119
- It's all good.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.022
What are you watching?

23:46.224 --> 23:47.659
- I have no idea.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.732
(woman talking on TV)

24:03.942 --> 24:05.343
- And you

24:08.346 --> 24:09.681
suck.

24:09.681 --> 24:10.849
I thought you were
just being modest

24:10.849 --> 24:13.852
when you said you could shoot.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.253
Obviously not.

24:15.253 --> 24:16.221
Which way would you go?

24:16.221 --> 24:17.522
- I don't know, but you're bigs.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.057
Remember you're the big balls.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.358
- Yeah, I'm the big balls, but
there's a big one over there.

24:20.358 --> 24:21.693
- Go for the 14.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.163
(laughter)

24:25.163 --> 24:27.199
- Does that mean I get,
oh I still get one shot.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.433
- Yeah, you still get one shot.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.434
- I can see.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.770
- [Levi] Hit it like there.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.638
- You think I can
get that in there?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.073
- Yeah straight out.
- How?

24:35.073 --> 24:36.475
- If you shoot
from like this way.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.009
- [Sanja] This way?

24:38.009 --> 24:39.611
- Yeah, like right there.
- Yeah, like right there.

24:39.611 --> 24:40.779
- Now come closer to the ball.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.781
What are you do all day?

24:42.781 --> 24:45.217
- I swim in the pool.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.718
♪ Cause when it's
all said and done

24:46.718 --> 24:50.121
♪ She's making sure
I forget it all.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.390
♪ Cause I already
know just what I want.

24:52.390 --> 24:53.959
♪ What I want.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.462
♪ And she already knows just
what I see, I see a mllion.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.698
♪ But know that she's
the fucking one.

24:59.698 --> 25:03.802
♪ Come take a trip we planting
never planning, let it be.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.339
♪ Cause I already know just
what I want, what I want.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.841
♪ And she already

25:09.841 --> 25:13.245
♪ I see a million but she

25:13.245 --> 25:16.882
♪ Come take a trip we planting
never planning let it be.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.217
- There's five, five papers.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.486
Yellow papers.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.155
Well, check them
out will ya, mate?

25:24.155 --> 25:25.690
And get back to me.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.158
All right.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.261
Fucks sake.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.911
(wind blowing)

25:48.513 --> 25:50.015
Whose car is that out front?

25:50.015 --> 25:52.317
- Well it must be Sanja's
boyfriend, her new one.

25:52.317 --> 25:53.585
- New?

25:53.585 --> 25:55.787
- Levi's his name.

25:55.787 --> 25:57.589
- What kind of name's Levi?

25:57.589 --> 25:59.658
That's an old man's name.

25:59.658 --> 26:02.360
And he drives an old timer's
car, have you seen it?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.129
- He's very handsome.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.632
- Who is he, where are they?

26:07.632 --> 26:09.000
- They must be in
the pool I think.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.802
He borrowed a pair
of your boardies.

26:10.802 --> 26:13.238
- Don't go loaning my
things to other people.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.941
Especially strange ugly men.

26:15.941 --> 26:19.878
- How many pairs of
swimmers you got, Vik?

26:19.878 --> 26:22.213
- You're off the mark, Love.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.654
- Who's that?

26:30.989 --> 26:31.823
Bald dude.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.159
- That's my dad.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.727
Just smile and nod.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.199
Oh, hi Dad.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.001
- Nice to meet you.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.169
- I want my shorts back.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.403
- [Sanja] You have
heaps, are you serious?

26:45.403 --> 26:47.305
- I like those ones,
they're my color.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.573
Come on, change
out of them for me.

26:48.573 --> 26:49.874
- Sorry, I thought I
was right to use them.

26:49.874 --> 26:51.676
- [Sanja] You are, ignore him,

26:51.676 --> 26:53.345
- I didn't give you
permission to be in my house,

26:53.345 --> 26:55.146
let alone borrow my shit.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.448
- Let's go.

27:00.986 --> 27:02.654
- [Levi] There goes another job.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.390
- It's probably a dumb job
for moppets it's like my dad.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.725
Who wants a dumb job?

27:06.725 --> 27:08.293
- Me.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.527
- You don't have to go.

27:09.527 --> 27:10.428
- Yes I do.

27:11.629 --> 27:14.032
Where should I put these?

27:14.032 --> 27:15.800
- Stay a little longer.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.870
- I can't, your dad's a dick
- Please.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.945
- Yeah, um how're you?

27:26.945 --> 27:28.713
- [Dad] Yeah I'm good.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.148
What's happening, you all right?

27:30.148 --> 27:32.317
- Have Sanja and
the new boy left?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.219
- Yeah, I think so.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.053
Why?

27:36.287 --> 27:38.523
- What do you think of him?

27:40.325 --> 27:43.695
- I don't know him
that well, why?

27:43.695 --> 27:46.998
What's up Ves, I
can see it, what?

27:46.998 --> 27:48.099
What's wrong?

27:48.099 --> 27:49.434
- You seemed to get a bit angry.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.269
- What's that face?

27:51.269 --> 27:52.103
Tell me.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.974
- Okay, so you
remember Wendel, right?

27:55.974 --> 27:57.075
- [Dad] Of course.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.077
- Okay, so Sanja's ex
- [Dad] Yes.

27:59.077 --> 28:02.480
- And you know that this new
boy is Wendel's brother, right?

28:02.480 --> 28:04.182
- Right
- [Vesna] Yeah.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.152
Wendel, like Sonja's ex, yeah.

28:07.152 --> 28:11.322
And we were over at his house,
and he lives with Wendel

28:12.190 --> 28:14.225
and I don't know, I just think.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.295
- Ves, what's wrong?

28:17.295 --> 28:18.797
Spit it out, Ves,
what's going on?

28:18.797 --> 28:22.167
- I think Sanja's in trouble
cause Levi's doing drugs.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.001
- What do you mean?

28:23.001 --> 28:24.235
- Well, like.

28:24.235 --> 28:26.538
- [Dad] He's doing it
or he's dealing it?

28:26.538 --> 28:28.706
- I think he's doing both.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.309
I know that he's dealing.

28:31.309 --> 28:32.544
- Don't muck around
about this, Ves.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.711
- [Vesna] I'm not
mucking around, Dad,

28:33.711 --> 28:34.646
I'm telling you,
that's why I asked you

28:34.646 --> 28:36.414
if Sanja and Levi had left.

28:36.414 --> 28:37.816
- [Dad] Ves.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.350
Dad, I'm not joking,
listen to me okay?

28:39.350 --> 28:40.552
I think Sanja's
in trouble because

28:40.552 --> 28:42.554
when we went over to
Levi and Wendel's house

28:42.554 --> 28:44.889
there were like packets and
it just smelt like smoke.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.859
And you know what Wendel did
to Sanja and I don't want

28:47.859 --> 28:50.829
it to happen again, so
I'm just telling you.

28:50.829 --> 28:51.963
- How do you know this?

28:51.963 --> 28:53.598
What were you at
the house doing?

28:53.598 --> 28:54.432
You were doing drugs, were ya?

28:54.432 --> 28:55.667
- What!

28:55.667 --> 28:57.202
Fuck no, Dad, I'm trying
to tell you that Levi

28:57.202 --> 28:59.204
is fucking doing drugs, okay,
and that I think he's dealing

28:59.204 --> 29:00.238
and Sanja's in trouble.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.039
- [Dad] You've seen all this?

29:01.039 --> 29:02.307
- Yeah.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.241
- [Dad] This is serious,
Ves, don't muck around.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.309
- I'm not mucking around, Dad.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.543
Look, Sanja is in trouble.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.045
- [Dad] All right.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.848
- [Vesna] Look, I'm
just trying to say

29:09.848 --> 29:12.484
cause Sanja's like,
she's your daughter.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.551
You have to take
care of this stuff.

29:13.551 --> 29:14.652
- I know, all right?

29:14.652 --> 29:15.887
Thank you.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.288
I'll deal with it.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.890
- I wouldn't just say it, okay?

29:18.890 --> 29:19.824
Cause I don't say shit.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.259
- [Dad] I believe ya, all right?

29:21.259 --> 29:24.662
Just let me think for a second.

29:24.662 --> 29:27.165
(eerie music)

29:31.069 --> 29:32.303
- [Sanja] My door was shut.

29:32.303 --> 29:33.505
- [Levi] A bit of privacy, mate?

29:33.505 --> 29:34.672
- Keep your legs shut
and the door open

29:34.672 --> 29:35.507
not the other way around.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.175
- That's a bit rude.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.244
- Bit rude?

29:39.244 --> 29:40.078
Bit rude?

29:41.880 --> 29:42.814
Who do you think you are, mate?

29:42.814 --> 29:43.748
- [Sanja] Dad, let him go!

29:43.748 --> 29:45.650
- Came into my fucking house.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.085
- Dad!
- Think you're a man, do ya?

29:47.085 --> 29:47.919
Huh?

29:47.919 --> 29:49.354
- [Sanja] Let go.

29:50.922 --> 29:51.756
Mom, help!

29:52.690 --> 29:55.793
(muffled yelling)

29:55.793 --> 29:58.363
- [Dad] You dope
head piece of shit.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.797
I'll make you piss
you little dog.

30:00.832 --> 30:01.666
- [Sanja] Get off!

30:01.666 --> 30:02.600
Mom!

30:02.600 --> 30:04.636
Leave us, please!

30:04.636 --> 30:05.637
- [Mom] Vik!

30:09.841 --> 30:11.976
What the fuck happened in here?

30:11.976 --> 30:13.178
What have you done?

30:13.178 --> 30:14.179
What the fuck happened?
- What?

30:14.179 --> 30:15.947
He was on fucking top of her.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.415
In my own fucking house.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.350
Harden the fuck up,
Levi, you little prick.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.752
- [Sanja] Pig!
- [Mom] Levi, are you okay?

30:20.752 --> 30:21.686
- [Levi] Yeah.

30:21.686 --> 30:22.487
- [Mom] I'll get you some water.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.688
- Thanks, Mom.

30:23.688 --> 30:24.889
You all right?

30:24.889 --> 30:25.823
- Is there any guns here
I should know about?

30:25.823 --> 30:26.758
- Just hush for a second, okay?

30:26.758 --> 30:27.926
- I'm fine.
- Levi.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.430
(dramatic music)

30:51.549 --> 30:54.385
(water splashing)

31:14.372 --> 31:15.707
- Guess what, dog?

31:15.707 --> 31:18.443
Viktor had me in a
sleeper choke today.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.712
- Were you plugging his
daughter or his wife?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.647
- One or the other.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.149
- [Wendel] You dirty dog.

31:25.149 --> 31:27.752
- Hey, look man, I just
wanted to ask you something.

31:27.752 --> 31:28.953
- [Wendel] Yeah?

31:28.953 --> 31:30.154
- It's a personal insult
to both of us, okay?

31:30.154 --> 31:31.389
He saw my door was shut
and he still forced

31:31.389 --> 31:32.957
his way in to stamp
his authority.

31:32.957 --> 31:34.192
He's a tyrant.

31:34.192 --> 31:35.260
- She's hell bent on
leaving home today

31:35.260 --> 31:36.694
so we've got to sort something.

31:36.694 --> 31:38.096
- [Wendel] She's got money,
she can go to a hotel.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.398
- [Levi] Not really, her
savings are for her uni degree.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.833
- [Wendel] She's
too dumb for uni.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.067
- [Levi] I can't
afford anything decent

31:43.067 --> 31:44.369
and she's anti motels.

31:44.369 --> 31:46.137
- [Wendel] Yeah, all right.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.405
As long as she's put on a leash

31:47.405 --> 31:48.706
and kept in the
shed at all times.

31:48.706 --> 31:49.908
- [Levi] It'll
only be temporary.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.175
We're talking
about, moving East.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.443
- Reminds me, I
don't know Sanja,

31:52.443 --> 31:53.711
me and her have never met.

31:53.711 --> 31:54.679
- [Levi] What?

31:54.679 --> 31:56.748
- Claire's coming over tonight.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.650
- [Levi] Yeah, all
right, I gotcha.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.451
How about a dinner for
all us at seven o'clock?

32:00.451 --> 32:01.686
- Yeah.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.588
I'll introduce you
to a real lady,

32:03.588 --> 32:06.724
different than these fucking
cheap skanks you go for.

32:06.724 --> 32:10.461
Looks like a bit of a
tip-rat but treats me well.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.462
- What have you got
against Sanja, man?

32:11.462 --> 32:13.464
She's a nice girl.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.667
- Yeah, she's pretty nice.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.368
She specialized in
giving me rim jobs.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.170
That was nice.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.606
Next time you kiss her,
just remember where

32:21.606 --> 32:23.341
those lips have been, all right?

32:23.341 --> 32:24.542
- Haven't you got
somewhere to be?

32:24.542 --> 32:25.610
(laughs)

32:25.610 --> 32:27.645
- [Wendel] Later, dog.

32:27.645 --> 32:28.646
- Crackhead.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.418
(waves crashing)

32:33.418 --> 32:35.453
- [Mom] You need to cut
your dad some slack.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.922
- [Sanja] He tried to cut
my boyfriend's head off.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.291
- [Mom] Apparently your
boyfriend's into selling drugs.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.959
- [Sanja] Vesna,
that little snitch.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.194
- [Mom] Is he?

32:43.194 --> 32:44.629
- [Sanja] Levi's
a great guy, okay?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.397
The polar opposite
of his brother.

32:46.397 --> 32:47.665
- [Mom] I still think
you should reconsider.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.100
- [Sanja] Look, I told
you I've gotta go, Mom.

32:49.100 --> 32:49.934
I'll call you.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.035
You, not Vik.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.542
(dramatic music)

33:00.912 --> 33:03.281
(heavy breathing)

33:03.281 --> 33:04.449
- They're here.

33:04.449 --> 33:05.550
We should go say hi.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.018
- [Sanja] What?

33:07.018 --> 33:08.486
- [Levi] Now's the
time to break the ice.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.921
- [Sanja] Shut the door, Levi.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.255
- [Levi] You've never
met Wendel, okay?

33:11.255 --> 33:12.090
It's important.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.024
I forgot to tell you.

33:13.024 --> 33:14.225
- [Sanja] Are you serious, why?

33:14.225 --> 33:16.527
- [Levi] Just please, come on.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.895
- [Sanja] I can't believe this.

33:17.895 --> 33:19.731
Fine, but you're not
getting any later.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.432
- I finished 20 minutes ago.

33:21.432 --> 33:24.302
(laughs)

33:24.302 --> 33:25.136
Come on.

33:27.372 --> 33:28.206
Hey.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.310
- This is my brother Levi,

33:32.310 --> 33:33.811
Levi this is uh...

33:35.146 --> 33:37.482
- I'm Claire.
- [Wendel] Claire.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.150
- [Levi] Hi, Claire.
- It's nice to meet you.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.284
- [Levi] You too, how are you?

33:40.284 --> 33:42.787
- I'm good, and you?
- I'm good.

33:42.787 --> 33:44.322
- Um, who's this?

33:44.322 --> 33:46.557
- Oh yeah, this is Sanja.

33:46.557 --> 33:47.825
- [Wendel] Oh yeah?

33:47.825 --> 33:50.261
Finally I can put a
face to a name, eh?

33:50.261 --> 33:51.963
How ya doin?

33:51.963 --> 33:52.797
- [Sanja] Hi.

33:52.797 --> 33:53.865
- I'm Wendel.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.036
- Yeah, we had to eat
dinner without you,

33:59.036 --> 34:00.204
it was getting a bit late.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.073
- Oh, fuck, yeah, shit.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.976
Sorry, bro, I forgot
you were cooking for us.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.010
- Nah, don't worry about it.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.211
Yours is in the fridge.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.946
- [Claire] We just
ate, actually.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.615
Sorry.

34:10.615 --> 34:11.883
- Oh yeah?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.184
What fast food joint
did he take you to?

34:13.184 --> 34:14.852
- We had Greek.

34:14.852 --> 34:15.820
It was good, eh?

34:15.820 --> 34:17.221
- It was all right.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.356
- All right?

34:18.356 --> 34:19.891
- I told you I'm a vegetarian.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.125
- Pescatarian.

34:21.125 --> 34:24.796
- I'm a vegetarian,
there's a difference.

34:24.796 --> 34:25.997
- [Sanja] Can we go?

34:25.997 --> 34:28.099
- Um, yeah, we were
just about to go to bed

34:28.099 --> 34:29.300
just wanted to say hi first.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.435
- Hi.

34:30.435 --> 34:31.269
- It was nice to meet you both.

34:31.269 --> 34:32.203
- You too.

34:32.203 --> 34:34.872
Enjoy the midnight snack.

34:34.872 --> 34:35.807
- Have fun.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.682
I forgot, I forgot.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.785
- You forget you have
a brother as well?

34:47.785 --> 34:48.986
- [Wendel] Well, him too.

34:48.986 --> 34:51.389
I haven't seen that
little prick in a while.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.824
- And what about her?

34:52.824 --> 34:55.092
- [Wendel] I've never meet
Sanja, or whatever her name is.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.394
- You've never met her?

34:56.394 --> 34:57.628
- No, never met her.

34:57.628 --> 34:58.863
- I didn't even
ask you a question

34:58.863 --> 35:01.065
and you're already
giving me an answer.

35:01.065 --> 35:02.066
(Wendel laughs)

35:02.066 --> 35:03.434
- [Wendel] I've never met her.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.170
- You've never met her?

35:06.170 --> 35:08.306
- I've never met her.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.042
- He's a maniac incapable
of not lying for two minutes

35:11.042 --> 35:13.644
and you made me play along.

35:13.644 --> 35:16.013
- I guess he didn't
wanna scare the girl off.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.648
- I feel sorry for Claire.

35:17.648 --> 35:18.483
Ha, sucka!

35:20.184 --> 35:22.120
- Promise, promise.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.888
- [Claire] All right.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.026
- [Levi] We having
a snort, are we?

35:29.026 --> 35:30.495
(sniffs)

35:30.495 --> 35:33.764
- It's my steroidal spray,
it helps me breathe at night.

35:33.764 --> 35:34.699
Want some?

35:34.699 --> 35:36.834
- [Levi] Yeah, I'll have some.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.003
- You know it's not
gonna make you bigger.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.938
- What are you talking about?

35:40.938 --> 35:43.007
(laughs)

35:43.975 --> 35:45.142
- [Sanja] Wow.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.714
Oi.

35:49.714 --> 35:52.817
You finished 20 minutes ago.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.651
Remember?

36:00.691 --> 36:02.527
You're such a sucker.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.128
You're the sucker.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.964
- [Levi] I'll suck on anything.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.937
(birds chirping)

36:23.948 --> 36:25.182
- [Wendel] Where's my piece.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.785
- [Sanja] Hello to you too.

36:27.785 --> 36:29.253
- Thought it was customary
to make breakfast

36:29.253 --> 36:32.023
in bed for people when you're
a guest in their house.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.491
- I thought it was customary
to give someone back

36:33.491 --> 36:36.027
their car when they
loaned it to you.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.896
- That's not customary,
I thought it was a gift.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.198
- You thought it was a gift?

36:41.198 --> 36:42.033
Wow.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.403
- You gonna use
a plate for that?

36:46.370 --> 36:49.106
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

36:49.106 --> 36:50.875
Have we met before?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.710
Aren't we strangers?

36:52.710 --> 36:54.712
- I don't know.

36:54.712 --> 36:58.883
You kinda remind me of some
sexy lady I dated once.

37:01.919 --> 37:03.020
Claire wouldn't stay
in the same house

37:03.020 --> 37:05.022
as you if she knew our history.

37:05.022 --> 37:08.459
- Shh, better keep your voice
down, she might hear you.

37:08.459 --> 37:09.560
Where is she?

37:11.028 --> 37:13.731
- You know it's funny
how we've become this big

37:13.731 --> 37:15.366
happy family.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.435
- And you're our
strange old uncle.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.437
(laughs)

37:19.437 --> 37:22.006
So you started up the salon yet?

37:22.006 --> 37:23.874
- I'm using all my annual
leave at the moment,

37:23.874 --> 37:26.110
at work trying to get it going.

37:26.978 --> 37:27.945
It's a big task.

37:27.945 --> 37:30.247
- You'll be all right.

37:30.247 --> 37:31.916
- It'll take awhile.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.421
You can leave the
rent above the fridge.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.690
- You're not seriously charging
me after taking my car?

37:39.690 --> 37:41.759
- Does this make us even?

37:52.069 --> 37:54.839
(dramatic music)

38:07.318 --> 38:09.353
Sorry I'm late, bro.

38:09.353 --> 38:10.254
How are ya?

38:11.422 --> 38:13.057
- Been a minute, mate.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.592
- Yeah, sorry man
I've been caught up

38:14.592 --> 38:16.160
in some fucking shit lately.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.428
- You all good?

38:19.697 --> 38:21.432
- For the time being.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.401
What's this junk of shit?

38:23.401 --> 38:24.602
Where's your Skyline?

38:24.602 --> 38:26.470
- [Jason] Yeah,
business is bad, eh?

38:26.470 --> 38:27.305
- What, that bad?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.673
- Nah, man. I um.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.775
I found out I had some
fucking heat on me,

38:30.775 --> 38:31.809
I had to get rid of it.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.310
- You serious?

38:33.310 --> 38:37.448
- Yeah, a customer of mine
got done and mighta talked.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.584
- Did you get him or her?

38:40.584 --> 38:41.652
- [Jason] Yeah,
we'll get the cunt.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.820
We'll get the cunt.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.021
- No doubt, no doubt.

38:44.021 --> 38:44.922
Yeah

38:46.157 --> 38:48.359
- So for the time being,
this is me new ride.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.894
- [Wendel] You look
like the right law

38:49.894 --> 38:51.896
abiding citizen in that, eh?

38:53.064 --> 38:54.865
- [Jason] Cops probably
think I'm a pensioner

38:54.865 --> 38:56.734
or an Asian lady with
two kids in the back.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.069
- [Wendel] Yeah.

38:59.503 --> 39:02.907
- [Jason] Anyways mate,
I got the stock standard,

39:02.907 --> 39:06.277
but how many of those cock
rockers were you after?

39:07.244 --> 39:09.280
- Half a bottle?
- Yeah.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.083
Make it a full amount, you gotta

39:12.083 --> 39:14.518
please the misses, all right?

39:15.986 --> 39:19.023
- Is it all right if I fix you
up next week when I get paid?

39:19.023 --> 39:20.524
- Yeah, yeah, all good.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.759
I know where you live.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.361
- [Wendel] Cheers,
you're the man.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.466
- My place probably still
ain't the best option though.

39:28.466 --> 39:29.433
- Where do we do it, here?

39:29.433 --> 39:30.368
Mine?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.169
- Wherevs, just let us know.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.637
- [Wendel] All right.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.306
How is the wifey?

39:35.306 --> 39:39.477
- Still nagging me to retire,
otherwise can't complain.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.312
- Yeah shit, eh?

39:41.312 --> 39:42.880
- They want the money
though, don't they?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.949
- They don't know what
the fuck they want.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.484
- Yeah they do, mate.

39:46.484 --> 39:47.384
Everything
- Everything.

39:47.384 --> 39:48.753
(laughs)

39:48.753 --> 39:50.054
- You know how it is, man.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.556
- Yeah, all too well too well.

39:54.692 --> 39:57.161
- Anyway mate, enjoy
your shift, eh?

39:57.161 --> 39:59.130
- Yeah, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.364
- Dealer, you gonna teach us how

40:00.364 --> 40:01.732
to count cards one
of these days, mate.

40:01.732 --> 40:02.800
We'll clean up, you and me.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.701
Go halvesies.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.369
- Next stop, Monaco.

40:19.183 --> 40:21.752
(upbeat music)

40:51.182 --> 40:53.684
(eerie music)

41:20.211 --> 41:21.145
- Your dad?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.548
- Yeah.

41:24.548 --> 41:26.150
- Didn't take long.

41:28.552 --> 41:30.688
- He's forever caving
in after the fact,

41:30.688 --> 41:32.523
instead of not like...

41:34.058 --> 41:36.827
Just don't worry,
doesn't matter.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.264
- You still all
right to stay here?

41:40.264 --> 41:41.832
You're not getting any
bad vibes or anything?

41:41.832 --> 41:42.666
- No.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.506
I'd be staying
with you anywhere.

41:50.841 --> 41:51.675
Yeah.

41:53.110 --> 41:54.511
- I would be too.

42:11.428 --> 42:14.164
(waves crashing)

42:31.348 --> 42:34.118
- Don't poke your tongue.

42:34.118 --> 42:36.553
There was some famous
person who visited Perth,

42:36.553 --> 42:37.821
I don't know, I forget the name,

42:37.821 --> 42:40.324
and they got driven from
the airport to the hotel

42:40.324 --> 42:44.495
and on the way they asked
the driver where's the city?

42:45.696 --> 42:48.065
And the driver goes we
just drove through it.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.333
Get it?

42:49.333 --> 42:52.670
- You don't have to
convince me to leave.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.638
- I thought it was
a funny anecdote.

42:54.638 --> 42:56.974
- It was, it was funny.

42:56.974 --> 42:58.509
Kind of.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.477
- Don't say it's funny if
you don't find it funny.

43:00.477 --> 43:02.913
- All right, it's not funny.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.415
- Fuck you, it is.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.086
I can't wait to leave anyway.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.589
- I'd leave right now if it
wasn't for your transfer.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.756
- And we will.

43:16.627 --> 43:18.395
You don't hold my
hand whenever we walk.

43:18.395 --> 43:21.165
- Yeah, I'm not really
a big fan of PDA.

43:21.165 --> 43:24.101
- I like that you
don't smother me.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.906
Just don't kiss me after
that cigarette, okay?

43:28.906 --> 43:30.741
- I'll do what I want.

43:32.176 --> 43:33.010
- Yeah.

43:34.411 --> 43:35.879
- I don't know why
I'm struggling so much

43:35.879 --> 43:38.248
to walk up this damn hill.

43:38.248 --> 43:39.383
- Too unfit.

43:39.383 --> 43:40.718
Too many cigarettes.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.786
(laughs)

43:44.054 --> 43:45.389
Can you put it out?

43:45.389 --> 43:46.223
- Nope.

44:07.344 --> 44:10.080
(dramatic music)

44:24.962 --> 44:27.231
- I went downstairs
looking for sleeping pills

44:27.231 --> 44:31.402
and I went into the kitchen
I couldn't find any,

44:32.803 --> 44:35.205
and I went to Wendel's room
thinking he'd have some

44:35.205 --> 44:38.442
and he came home and
made a move on me.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.979
After I rejected him
he left the house.

44:41.979 --> 44:44.648
And you were still in Levi land.

44:51.255 --> 44:52.923
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

44:52.923 --> 44:53.757
Hmm?

44:55.092 --> 44:56.326
- What?

44:56.326 --> 44:58.028
- You're just gonna let
him get away with it?

44:58.028 --> 45:00.164
- Well if my ex was in
my room late at night

45:00.164 --> 45:02.332
and I was drunk, I
assume that he was drunk

45:02.332 --> 45:03.834
and you were probably
wearing fuck all.

45:03.834 --> 45:05.502
- Please, Levi,
don't put this on me.

45:05.502 --> 45:06.904
- I'm not.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.573
I blame myself for
moving us here.

45:09.573 --> 45:10.607
It's my fault.

45:10.607 --> 45:12.042
- It's his fault, not yours.

45:12.042 --> 45:13.477
- He mistook the situation.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.512
You were in his room,
how could he resist?

45:15.512 --> 45:17.247
- He disrespected us both.

45:17.247 --> 45:19.083
- He's my closest family member,

45:19.083 --> 45:20.884
he wouldn't snuff
me out on purpose.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.519
- You can be so dense sometimes.

45:22.519 --> 45:23.854
- I get what happened.

45:23.854 --> 45:25.289
- No you don't.
- You were in his room.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.824
- You took his ex girlfriend
and brought her home

45:26.824 --> 45:28.325
to rub it in his face, okay?

45:28.325 --> 45:30.094
He wants payback,
he wants revenge.

45:30.094 --> 45:31.428
What better way?

45:36.700 --> 45:39.103
(rap music)

46:28.218 --> 46:32.389
(phone ringing and vibrating)

46:39.363 --> 46:40.330
- [Levi] Wendel?

46:40.330 --> 46:41.331
- Hey, where you at?

46:41.331 --> 46:42.166
- [Levi] I left you a note.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.867
- Yeah yeah yeah, I saw.

46:43.867 --> 46:45.602
You breaking up with me, are ya?

46:45.602 --> 46:47.237
- I heard you're
not over Sanja yet.

46:47.237 --> 46:48.839
- Oh, here we go.

46:48.839 --> 46:52.409
Listen, listen Lee, last
night I came home trashed,

46:52.409 --> 46:53.810
and found her in my
bedroom all alone

46:53.810 --> 46:55.479
asking for some sleeping pills.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.915
- It's not happening, Wendel.

46:59.049 --> 47:00.751
It's not happening.
- Try my balls.

47:00.751 --> 47:02.019
Do it properly.

47:02.019 --> 47:04.454
- [Monique] You better
repay the favor.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.958
- What else am I supposed
to think, all right?

47:07.958 --> 47:10.694
I hardly tried, I said
some dirty shit, alright.

47:10.694 --> 47:12.129
That's all I said.

47:12.129 --> 47:14.264
- Bottom line is we
shouldn't have been there.

47:14.264 --> 47:15.566
- [Monique] It's pointless.

47:15.566 --> 47:16.400
Literally.

47:17.401 --> 47:20.337
- [Levi] What's going on Del?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.339
- It's not you, it's me.

47:25.042 --> 47:26.376
- [Levi] Del?

47:26.376 --> 47:27.945
- It's water under
the bridge, yeah?

47:27.945 --> 47:29.613
- Yeah, it was a
misunderstanding.

47:29.613 --> 47:31.181
- Exactly, exactly.

47:32.416 --> 47:33.350
Cool.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.284
- It's not cool with Sanja.

47:34.284 --> 47:36.587
- Fucking nevermind Sanja.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.422
- Hurry up, I'm bored.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.259
- Come home, all right?

47:42.259 --> 47:43.760
Come home.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.563
Put your big boy pants on,
take some charge, all right?

47:46.563 --> 47:48.131
- I can't do it.

47:48.131 --> 47:49.466
- What do you mean can't do it?

47:49.466 --> 47:51.068
Can't do it.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.669
- Who're you talking to anyways?

47:52.669 --> 47:53.604
- My stupid brother.

47:53.604 --> 47:54.972
- Hey Levi.

47:54.972 --> 47:55.906
- Who is that?

47:55.906 --> 47:56.840
Doesn't sound like Claire.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.675
- Tell him I said hi.

47:58.675 --> 48:00.110
- Tash says hi.

48:00.110 --> 48:00.911
- Tash?

48:00.911 --> 48:01.845
I'm not fucking Tash.

48:01.845 --> 48:03.580
- No, all right, all right.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.816
It's Monique, Monique.

48:05.816 --> 48:07.384
- You're damn
straight it's Monique.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.119
- [Levi] Sanja's applied
for a uni transfer though,

48:09.119 --> 48:12.823
and we're leaving town, so you
know, heading to Melbourne.

48:12.823 --> 48:15.192
- You're not fucking
leaving Perth, fuck off.

48:15.192 --> 48:16.393
- I'll be leaving in a second.

48:16.393 --> 48:17.661
- You're not leaving either.

48:17.661 --> 48:21.498
- I'll come over, say
goodbye before we go.

48:21.498 --> 48:22.799
- So that's it, hmm?

48:22.799 --> 48:24.501
You're leaving?

48:24.501 --> 48:27.204
You afraid I'll steal her?

48:27.204 --> 48:29.940
- We already planned it
before any of this happened.

48:29.940 --> 48:32.876
- [Wendel] Well
off you fucking go.

48:35.545 --> 48:36.613
- [Monique] All good big daddy?

48:36.613 --> 48:37.814
- [Wendel] Shut up.

48:37.814 --> 48:39.283
- [Monique] Pass
me the pip-ee then.

48:39.283 --> 48:41.251
- [Wendel] No more stupid
jokes about my penis.

48:41.251 --> 48:43.153
At least it's big size.

48:46.490 --> 48:47.491
Get out.

48:47.491 --> 48:48.725
- What?

48:48.725 --> 48:50.294
I was referring to
the pipe, all right?

48:50.294 --> 48:52.796
- Get your fucking shit
and get out, all right?

48:52.796 --> 48:53.730
Get out.

48:53.730 --> 48:54.665
Get your fucking, get out!

48:54.665 --> 48:56.566
- I'm not going anywhere!

49:03.407 --> 49:05.676
- All right, let's go then.

49:05.676 --> 49:06.710
- Awesome.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.696
- Wendel!

49:25.696 --> 49:26.997
What are you doing?
- See ya!

49:28.598 --> 49:29.433
Fuck you.

49:29.433 --> 49:30.400
(muffled yelling)

49:31.568 --> 49:34.071
- [Monique] Fuck
you, you asshole.

49:34.071 --> 49:37.240
(upbeat techno music)

49:48.852 --> 49:49.953
- [Levi] Paz.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.421
- [Sanja] What?

49:51.421 --> 49:53.890
- [Levi] Some guy Paz just made
a piss-poor offer on my car.

49:53.890 --> 49:54.991
- [Sanja] Paz?

49:54.991 --> 49:57.027
- [Levi] That's his name.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.362
- [Sanja] You didn't tell
me you were selling it,

49:58.362 --> 49:59.296
how much he offer?

49:59.296 --> 50:01.431
- [Levi] Better off keeping it.

50:01.431 --> 50:03.200
- [Sanja] Keep it.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.835
- [Levi] Yeah, I prefer
to have my own car anyway,

50:04.835 --> 50:06.436
I hate public transport.

50:06.436 --> 50:08.739
- [Sanja] Uh, who doesn't?

50:08.739 --> 50:10.073
- [Levi] What if the
Melbourne transport system's

50:10.073 --> 50:11.408
worse than ours?

50:12.442 --> 50:14.778
- [Sanja] Keep the car, babe.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.614
It might be a
better system though

50:18.915 --> 50:20.717
- [Levi] I need the money.

50:20.717 --> 50:22.686
This place is costing over
a couple hundred a night.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.688
- [Sanja] I've got a hundred
grand saved, I'll pay for it.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.324
- [Levi] I prefer you didn't.

50:27.324 --> 50:28.825
- [Sanja] You've got
really traditional forms

50:28.825 --> 50:30.794
of the man must pay.

50:30.794 --> 50:33.964
It bothers you, it
matters to you, not me.

50:33.964 --> 50:34.798
Dickhead.

50:35.966 --> 50:37.601
- [Levi] First
you'll tire of it,

50:37.601 --> 50:40.604
then you'll resent it, then
finally you'll hate it.

50:40.604 --> 50:41.671
Including me.

50:45.041 --> 50:47.277
- [Sanja] Well, you
can be my slave.

50:47.277 --> 50:48.612
Mr. Slave.

50:48.612 --> 50:50.981
- [Levi] I always
wanted to be Mr. Slave.

50:50.981 --> 50:51.815
(laughs)

50:51.815 --> 50:53.817
Do what he does.

50:53.817 --> 50:56.086
- [Sanja] You're a whore.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.800
- [Levi] How'd you go?

51:09.800 --> 51:10.734
When are we leaving?

51:10.734 --> 51:12.669
- About three weeks she said.

51:12.669 --> 51:14.671
- You were told a few
days over the phone.

51:14.671 --> 51:16.973
- Yeah, but it takes time to
prepare academic transcripts

51:16.973 --> 51:19.509
and letters of release.

51:19.509 --> 51:21.478
A few more weeks
will fly by, relax.

51:21.478 --> 51:22.946
Plus, it'll give you time
to sort out your course

51:22.946 --> 51:25.782
if you still want
to return, yeah?

51:29.186 --> 51:32.489
We can attend the same
campus, that'll be cute.

51:32.489 --> 51:33.490
So why rush?

51:34.424 --> 51:35.759
- I need to  rush.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.368
Think I've got an idea.

51:47.070 --> 51:48.905
- Wait, what, an idea?

51:51.508 --> 51:52.476
I'm not trying to tell you how

51:52.476 --> 51:53.710
to live your life or anything.

51:53.710 --> 51:54.611
- [Levi] I can't
get any other work.

51:54.611 --> 51:55.912
- [Sanja] It is a risk.

51:55.912 --> 51:57.180
- [Levi] This way I'll
make some poker money

51:57.180 --> 51:58.748
and be set for the
next six months.

51:58.748 --> 52:00.016
- [Sanja] I get that you're
bored here but I don't want

52:00.016 --> 52:01.618
you to go make a mess
of yourself like Wendel.

52:01.618 --> 52:04.621
- [Levi] This has nothing to
do with boredom, I'm not bored.

52:04.621 --> 52:07.390
You can't compare my level of
skill and precision to his.

52:07.390 --> 52:09.292
- Well then use that so
you can get a legit job.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.995
- I told you I
can't get any work,

52:11.995 --> 52:16.166
no one will hire me, not
without any qualifications.

52:16.933 --> 52:17.834
I've tried.

52:18.702 --> 52:20.604
I know what I'm doing.

52:20.604 --> 52:21.705
- Huh, tried.

52:23.340 --> 52:24.374
Okay.

52:33.283 --> 52:35.118
- Fuck you doing here?

52:36.553 --> 52:38.889
- You interested in a
business proposition?

52:39.990 --> 52:40.891
- No.

52:40.891 --> 52:42.826
- What's with all this?

52:44.661 --> 52:46.129
- Having a fire sale.

52:46.129 --> 52:47.864
- What setting up and
moving to a hippie haven.

52:47.864 --> 52:50.433
- You said you were
leaving, why're you here?

52:50.433 --> 52:53.770
- I got an idea that we can
both profit nicely from.

52:53.770 --> 52:56.072
- You're not getting
any cash or dope off me.

52:56.072 --> 52:57.574
- Come on, just get some gear.

52:57.574 --> 53:01.511
We'll make a mini fortune
man, I've got an idea.

53:02.946 --> 53:07.083
- [Wendel] I owe my
dealer 37 grand, Levi.

53:07.083 --> 53:07.918
- What?

53:09.286 --> 53:11.288
- [Wendel] Yeah.

53:11.288 --> 53:12.722
- [Levi] You can pay that.

53:12.722 --> 53:13.924
- [Wendel] Not
with just a couple.

53:13.924 --> 53:15.592
- [Levi] How can
you only have 2,000?

53:15.592 --> 53:17.093
What about all the previous
profits you've made?

53:17.093 --> 53:20.330
- Look, I'm not in the mood
for financial tips, all right?

53:20.330 --> 53:21.765
- [Levi] What about your car?

53:21.765 --> 53:24.501
That's gotta be at least
worth 20 or 30 odd, sell that.

53:24.501 --> 53:27.137
- Everything's refinanced,
and refinanced on top of that.

53:27.137 --> 53:29.005
I don't own shit.

53:29.005 --> 53:31.575
Credit cards maxed out.

53:31.575 --> 53:35.078
Can't even afford the
rent for this joint.

53:36.813 --> 53:39.482
- I can sell my car for
seven or eight grand.

53:39.482 --> 53:42.185
And ask Auntie and Uncle,
they'll help you out.

53:42.185 --> 53:43.687
- [Wendel] That's
how I got what I got.

53:43.687 --> 53:44.754
- Dad?

53:44.754 --> 53:46.556
- Fuck knows where he is.

53:46.556 --> 53:50.393
Probably take me six
months to track him down.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.969
- [Levi] You had the
addiction under control.

53:58.969 --> 54:01.404
Weren't you going to therapy?

54:01.404 --> 54:02.739
- [Wendel] I was clean.

54:02.739 --> 54:04.441
Stress got to me.

54:04.441 --> 54:07.611
That stupid hair
salon on idea failed.

54:09.145 --> 54:10.814
Even Claire left me.

54:13.383 --> 54:15.785
(dark music)

54:20.624 --> 54:21.858
- [Levi] How much
were you using?

54:21.858 --> 54:23.893
Even you couldn't have
used that amounts worth.

54:23.893 --> 54:26.096
- It's easier than you think.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.598
Plus I'm missing some.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.001
- [Levi] You're missing some?

54:33.370 --> 54:35.372
When's the deadline?

54:35.372 --> 54:37.607
- [Wendel] 48 hours.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.009
- [Levi] I'll get a loan.

54:39.009 --> 54:41.077
- [Wendel] You're not working,
you fucking dead beat.

54:41.077 --> 54:42.679
- [Levi] I'm gonna get
a loan, not from a bank,

54:42.679 --> 54:44.447
Sanja will help you out.

54:44.447 --> 54:45.548
- [Wendel] Yeah right.

54:45.548 --> 54:46.783
- [Levi] I'll ask her.

54:46.783 --> 54:48.652
Let's try and get
some more time.

54:48.652 --> 54:50.687
- [Wendel] If I can't
got any more time.

54:50.687 --> 54:51.721
I dunno.

54:52.589 --> 54:53.823
I'll start doing houses again.

54:53.823 --> 54:54.858
- [Levi] You'll end
up in a cell, Wendel,

54:54.858 --> 54:56.092
just let me ask her.

54:56.092 --> 54:57.761
- Would you lend me
money if you were her?

54:57.761 --> 54:58.595
Huh?

55:00.964 --> 55:01.798
Would you?

55:02.699 --> 55:05.468
(dramatic music)

55:11.808 --> 55:13.443
- [Levi] What else is there?

55:13.443 --> 55:14.944
There's gotta be another way.

55:14.944 --> 55:17.113
- [Wendel] There's no other
fucking way, alright Levi.

55:17.113 --> 55:18.381
(knocking)

55:18.381 --> 55:19.282
Who's that?

55:21.751 --> 55:23.753
Someone for the phone.

55:30.093 --> 55:32.829
(dramatic music)

55:53.016 --> 55:54.584
- [Levi] You gotta get
clean this time, legit.

55:54.584 --> 55:56.252
No more dealing,
no more dumb shit.

55:56.252 --> 55:57.887
You're not a big timer.

55:58.755 --> 56:01.291
- Don't get all righteous Lee.

56:01.291 --> 56:04.227
A minute ago you came over
to my house unannounced

56:04.227 --> 56:07.163
asking me to spot you some gear.

56:07.163 --> 56:08.498
Now you're asking me
to be the altar boy

56:08.498 --> 56:10.100
and abide by your conditions.

56:10.100 --> 56:12.669
- For some old uni mates,
some proper acquaintances,

56:12.669 --> 56:14.537
and that's beside
the point, isn't it?

56:14.537 --> 56:17.841
(Wendel laughs)
Don't fucking laugh.

56:17.841 --> 56:19.743
I'm doing this for you.

56:20.977 --> 56:22.946
- Believe me, I'm
done, all right?

56:22.946 --> 56:23.880
Finished.

56:23.880 --> 56:26.349
I had a relapse, big deal.

56:26.349 --> 56:27.851
- You gotta pay
it all back, too.

56:27.851 --> 56:29.085
- If you get it.

56:29.085 --> 56:31.354
- Will you pay back
the full amount?

56:31.955 --> 56:33.556
Well?

56:33.556 --> 56:34.524
Will you?

56:36.559 --> 56:37.394
Well?

56:37.394 --> 56:38.762
- Yes!

56:38.762 --> 56:40.864
I'll fucking pay it, all right?

56:40.864 --> 56:41.865
I'll pay it.

56:42.899 --> 56:44.367
I'll pay it back.

56:44.367 --> 56:46.202
- I'll have to give it
back to Sanja somehow.

56:46.202 --> 56:47.137
- How?

56:47.137 --> 56:48.538
- Just leave that to me.

56:48.538 --> 56:50.707
I'll figure something out.

56:52.175 --> 56:55.745
Do they know we're
related, you and me?

56:55.745 --> 56:57.113
- Why, you worried?

56:57.113 --> 56:59.849
- Well I'm probably
next, aren't I?

56:59.849 --> 57:01.618
- Look, I don't know.

57:01.618 --> 57:03.620
I never mentioned
you to Jase alright?

57:03.620 --> 57:05.688
He's never seen you.

57:05.688 --> 57:07.223
- Good.

57:07.223 --> 57:09.292
- You're leaving town anyway.

57:09.292 --> 57:11.661
- True.
- Big swinging cock.

57:11.661 --> 57:13.296
- She wanted to go.

57:13.296 --> 57:14.397
- That's bullshit.

57:14.397 --> 57:16.666
- She did.
- Fucking bullshit.

57:24.774 --> 57:27.977
Fuck you wanna leave
town for anyway?

57:27.977 --> 57:29.245
- So I can get a job.

57:29.245 --> 57:30.480
- Fuck.

57:30.480 --> 57:32.182
Why the fuck do
you wanna go, huh?

57:32.182 --> 57:33.283
- She wants to go, man.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.751
- Fucking bullshit,

57:34.751 --> 57:36.085
you wanna fucking suck
cock is what you wanna do.

57:36.085 --> 57:37.687
- You're the one
that sucks cock.

57:37.687 --> 57:39.055
- Yeah, well at least
I fucking do it,

57:39.055 --> 57:41.191
and I fucking admit I like it.

57:41.191 --> 57:42.025
You fuck.

57:43.493 --> 57:45.995
If I had to do it, I wouldn't.

57:48.398 --> 57:50.834
So what are you gonna do
over there anyway, Lee?

57:50.834 --> 57:51.668
Eh?

57:52.702 --> 57:53.937
Eh?

57:53.937 --> 57:57.407
You wanna leave to go
there and suck cock.

57:58.675 --> 58:01.244
What else you gonna do?

58:01.244 --> 58:03.346
You gonna fucking suck
some big fat fucking cock,

58:03.346 --> 58:05.615
that's what you're gonna do.

58:05.615 --> 58:06.850
Fucking Sanja.

58:09.485 --> 58:11.821
What else you gonna do, huh?

58:13.056 --> 58:14.524
What else you gonna
do over there?

58:14.524 --> 58:16.726
- Get away from you.
- Fucking suck cock.

58:16.726 --> 58:17.961
That's what you're gonna do.

58:17.961 --> 58:19.195
Suck some...

58:19.195 --> 58:20.763
- [Levi] What looks the
most real, you reckon?

58:20.763 --> 58:22.165
- [Wendel] Could be anything
in the place of anything.

58:22.165 --> 58:24.367
Sanja knows no better,
she never dabbled junk.

58:24.367 --> 58:25.902
- [Levi] Do you have
any sachet bags at home?

58:25.902 --> 58:27.103
- [Wendel] You need to
get bashed a little.

58:27.103 --> 58:28.338
- Yeah, I realize that.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.472
- I'll hit you there.

58:29.472 --> 58:30.306
Bang.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.110
Not doin it in the house
though, blood stains.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.778
- There's not
gonna be any blood.

58:35.778 --> 58:37.814
- Oh, there'll be
heaps of blood.

58:37.814 --> 58:41.384
Also, grass would be
better in case you fall.

58:41.384 --> 58:42.819
Unless you want to do
it on the hard pavement

58:42.819 --> 58:44.520
out the back.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.622
- Yeah, you're right.
- Thought you'd say that.

58:45.622 --> 58:46.756
- Grass is better.

58:46.756 --> 58:48.124
- Now what?

58:48.124 --> 58:49.826
(sighs)

58:49.826 --> 58:53.429
- I'll say I'm going out
then I'll come back to yours.

58:53.429 --> 58:55.365
- I'll flog off your stuff
and make it look real.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.567
- Yeah, trash my wallet and uh

58:57.567 --> 58:59.002
sell my phone too if you want.

58:59.002 --> 59:00.236
- Yep.

59:00.236 --> 59:01.437
All the money I can
get will help bro.

59:01.437 --> 59:03.039
- I think the flour's
back that way.

59:03.039 --> 59:03.973
What about my keys?

59:03.973 --> 59:05.408
- Nah, nobody steals keys.

59:05.408 --> 59:06.542
Alright, you need the car anyway

59:06.542 --> 59:08.444
to get back to the hotel.

59:08.444 --> 59:09.679
Where you staying, anyway?

59:09.679 --> 59:11.314
- Let's just do this
right, no traces.

59:11.314 --> 59:12.248
- Yep.

59:12.248 --> 59:13.149
- Alright.

59:17.754 --> 59:19.989
- You reckon this will do?

59:26.663 --> 59:27.931
How you doing?

59:27.931 --> 59:29.265
- Still smoking?

59:31.401 --> 59:32.835
- [Levi] You doing all right?

59:32.835 --> 59:33.670
Enjoying the scenery.

59:33.670 --> 59:34.771
- Is that it?

59:35.939 --> 59:39.342
- [Levi] You can have
a look if you want.

59:40.243 --> 59:41.744
- Show me.

59:41.744 --> 59:42.779
- [Levi] Not out here.

59:42.779 --> 59:44.347
There's heaps of
people out here,

59:44.347 --> 59:47.417
inside where no one can see you.

59:47.417 --> 59:48.418
- All right.

1:00:04.167 --> 1:00:05.068
- See that?

1:00:05.935 --> 1:00:07.203
- I see it.

1:00:07.203 --> 1:00:08.404
- You're staring into my future.

1:00:08.404 --> 1:00:10.440
- Wish we could
just try some of it.

1:00:11.841 --> 1:00:13.743
What, look how much is there.

1:00:13.743 --> 1:00:15.578
- It's not for us,
it's for my clients.

1:00:15.578 --> 1:00:16.779
- I'd only take a
little bit just to try.

1:00:16.779 --> 1:00:17.714
- No.
- No?

1:00:20.483 --> 1:00:23.586
- No, you've got your whole
life to make mistakes.

1:00:23.586 --> 1:00:25.755
I better go
- Wait, jeez,

1:00:25.755 --> 1:00:27.957
I'll be five minutes
then I can come with you.

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:29.659
- No, I've gotta be
a lone wolf tonight.

1:00:29.659 --> 1:00:31.761
- Well, I don't wanna
stay here alone.

1:00:31.761 --> 1:00:33.563
- They don't know you,
they only trust me.

1:00:33.563 --> 1:00:34.764
- [Sanja] You're paranoid.

1:00:34.764 --> 1:00:36.866
- It's a prerequisite
for this business.

1:00:36.866 --> 1:00:38.301
- I thought you came
back to pick me up.

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:39.702
Why are you here?

1:00:41.671 --> 1:00:43.373
- I came back just
to say goodnight,

1:00:43.373 --> 1:00:45.875
I'm gonna be home pretty late.

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:48.778
- Look don't do
this again, okay?

1:00:48.778 --> 1:00:50.413
I can tell it's not you.

1:00:50.413 --> 1:00:52.115
- It's not, but

1:00:52.115 --> 1:00:54.884
everyone pretends
when they have to.

1:00:56.352 --> 1:01:00.089
- Well, there's one thing
you need to do for me first.

1:01:00.957 --> 1:01:02.992
If you still wanna be friends.

1:01:03.893 --> 1:01:05.628
- Your toes again?

1:01:05.628 --> 1:01:07.030
- What?

1:01:07.030 --> 1:01:08.798
It's an erogenous zone.

1:01:08.798 --> 1:01:10.533
You're my slave, remember?

1:01:10.533 --> 1:01:12.402
You wanted the job.

1:01:12.402 --> 1:01:14.237
I'll wash them for ya.

1:01:29.285 --> 1:01:32.055
(dramatic music)

1:01:55.845 --> 1:01:57.113
- Wendel, hurry up.

1:01:57.113 --> 1:02:00.216
- [Wendel] I'll
be a minute, bro.

1:02:00.216 --> 1:02:02.919
(pop music)

1:02:16.799 --> 1:02:18.534
- [Levi] Going
for a smoke, okay?

1:02:18.534 --> 1:02:20.269
- Fuck yeah, hang on.

1:02:26.209 --> 1:02:27.310
Fucks sake.

1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:14.590
- Hey, um, I think I left my,

1:03:14.590 --> 1:03:15.591
nose spray

1:03:15.591 --> 1:03:17.693
at Wendel's under the pillow.

1:03:17.693 --> 1:03:18.828
I don't know, I
must have forgot it

1:03:18.828 --> 1:03:20.596
and I need to take it regularly.

1:03:20.596 --> 1:03:23.599
Can you please swing by on
your way back and pick it up?

1:03:23.599 --> 1:03:24.700
Call me.

1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:25.535
Love you.

1:03:30.106 --> 1:03:31.707
- [Levi] I don't know if
this is gonna work, man.

1:03:31.707 --> 1:03:35.611
- [Wendel] You gotta
expect her to say no, bro.

1:03:38.181 --> 1:03:39.248
You love her?

1:03:41.384 --> 1:03:42.218
You love her?

1:03:42.218 --> 1:03:43.386
- [Levi] I do.

1:03:47.623 --> 1:03:49.859
- If you need to bail Lee.

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:53.696
If you need to bail.

1:03:53.696 --> 1:03:54.630
- You've known her
for a long time,

1:03:54.630 --> 1:03:57.099
will she loan me that amount?

1:03:58.935 --> 1:04:00.970
- If she loves you she will.

1:04:00.970 --> 1:04:02.171
- Yeah she does.

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:08.511
- It's a boat load to you
or me, not so much to her.

1:04:10.313 --> 1:04:14.483
- What if the bank can't
process that amount in time?

1:04:16.085 --> 1:04:19.789
- Might be able to get
another day or two.

1:04:19.789 --> 1:04:22.391
Depending how lenient he feels.

1:04:24.627 --> 1:04:26.429
It's your call.

1:04:26.429 --> 1:04:29.198
- How else you going to
get the money in two days?

1:04:29.198 --> 1:04:30.433
- I don't know.

1:04:32.201 --> 1:04:35.137
Usual last ditch
routes, I guess.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:39.442
- She'll loan it.

1:04:39.442 --> 1:04:40.276
- Yeah?

1:04:40.276 --> 1:04:41.110
- Yep

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:45.715
All right,

1:04:46.616 --> 1:04:47.783
cheese breath.

1:04:55.157 --> 1:04:56.525
- [On Phone] The thing
is, I now know Levi

1:04:56.525 --> 1:04:58.394
is not a bad bloke.

1:04:58.394 --> 1:05:00.563
Vesna admits she got
things wrong about him,

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:02.965
got the brothers mixed up.

1:05:02.965 --> 1:05:05.768
So you're both welcome
back here any time.

1:05:05.768 --> 1:05:07.770
We need to talk, Sunny.

1:05:07.770 --> 1:05:09.505
Call me, okay?

1:05:09.505 --> 1:05:10.740
I'm sorry.

1:05:13.042 --> 1:05:13.876
- [Wendel] All good?

1:05:13.876 --> 1:05:15.044
- [Levi] Yeah.

1:05:16.979 --> 1:05:19.115
- [Wendel] Bit nervous, are we?

1:05:19.115 --> 1:05:20.816
When was the last time you
got thumped in the face?

1:05:20.816 --> 1:05:22.618
- That's your style, not mine.

1:05:22.618 --> 1:05:23.853
Just hit me in the nose and make

1:05:23.853 --> 1:05:25.521
it look nice and
messy, all right?

1:05:25.521 --> 1:05:26.455
- [Wendel] A cut above the eye

1:05:26.455 --> 1:05:27.423
would seal the deal, I reckon.

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:28.991
- [Levi] So would a black eye.

1:05:28.991 --> 1:05:30.459
- [Wendel] I doubt you
could handle that, fag boy.

1:05:30.459 --> 1:05:32.928
- Just hit me in the nose and

1:05:32.928 --> 1:05:33.996
ugh, not yet.

1:05:35.164 --> 1:05:35.965
- Thought you'd
prefer a surprise.

1:05:35.965 --> 1:05:37.199
- Fuck surprises.

1:05:40.670 --> 1:05:41.504
All right,

1:05:43.039 --> 1:05:43.873
go.

1:05:45.474 --> 1:05:46.309
Go!

1:05:53.282 --> 1:05:55.451
- [Wendel] Ow, I should
have worn a glove.

1:05:55.451 --> 1:05:57.386
- [Levi] A smack in the jaw's
not going to leave a mark.

1:05:57.386 --> 1:05:58.688
- Not my fault you flinched.

1:05:58.688 --> 1:06:00.589
- Might just use
a blade instead.

1:06:00.589 --> 1:06:01.957
- What, are you gonna
cut your own face?

1:06:01.957 --> 1:06:03.659
- A tiny little cut might work.

1:06:03.659 --> 1:06:05.361
- Since when do muggers
make delicate incisions

1:06:05.361 --> 1:06:06.562
on victim's faces?

1:06:06.562 --> 1:06:07.830
- Why don't we just
use fake blood?

1:06:07.830 --> 1:06:09.932
- She's not that fucking stupid.

1:06:09.932 --> 1:06:12.268
We gotta make it
look half legit.

1:06:12.268 --> 1:06:14.503
I'll say I had a gun or
knife on me, whatever.

1:06:14.503 --> 1:06:16.272
Come to think of it I don't
even need to get bashed.

1:06:16.272 --> 1:06:17.540
It is pretend.

1:06:17.540 --> 1:06:18.974
- Listen, listen.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:22.311
You fucking care if
Sanja leaves you?

1:06:22.311 --> 1:06:23.779
- What do you think?
- Answer.

1:06:23.779 --> 1:06:25.948
- Yeah, I care.
- How much?

1:06:25.948 --> 1:06:26.782
Eh?

1:06:27.783 --> 1:06:30.019
You gotta put on a fucking show

1:06:30.019 --> 1:06:31.787
or you gonna jerk your chain
for the rest of your life, huh?

1:06:31.787 --> 1:06:33.990
- Your slapping me
is not gonna help.

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:35.358
- I don't know my own strength.

1:06:35.358 --> 1:06:36.192
What the fuck?

1:06:36.192 --> 1:06:37.293
- That's how you hit.

1:06:37.293 --> 1:06:38.561
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:06:39.895 --> 1:06:41.230
- [Wendel] You're not
fucking circumsized, are you?

1:06:41.230 --> 1:06:43.366
- Come on, 80%
this time at least.

1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:45.434
Bitch.

1:06:54.110 --> 1:06:55.344
Yeah, nice one.

1:07:00.449 --> 1:07:01.584
Hit some other spots too.

1:07:01.584 --> 1:07:04.186
- [Wendel] One more, that's it.

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.022
Better.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:14.563
- Punch the nose hard too.

1:07:14.563 --> 1:07:16.065
- I've got a better
idea, give me your head.

1:07:16.065 --> 1:07:17.233
- [Levi] What?

1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:19.535
- [Wendel] Ready?

1:07:23.305 --> 1:07:24.807
You all right?

1:07:24.807 --> 1:07:27.576
- [Levi] One more proper to
make sure my face swells.

1:07:27.576 --> 1:07:31.747
- [Wendel] You're starting
to enjoy this, aren't ya?

1:07:33.616 --> 1:07:35.451
Your little dick's showing.

1:07:35.451 --> 1:07:36.285
- Where?

1:07:43.959 --> 1:07:46.395
- Fucking how thick's
your fucking head.

1:07:46.395 --> 1:07:49.064
Head like a fucking football.

1:07:50.733 --> 1:07:52.034
- [Levi] My turn.

1:07:52.034 --> 1:07:52.968
- [Wendel] Can't afford to lose

1:07:52.968 --> 1:07:55.037
too many more brain cells, bro.

1:07:56.238 --> 1:07:58.040
Remember this feeling
when you're facing her.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:00.109
- I'm never gonna
forget it, trust me.

1:08:00.109 --> 1:08:02.311
I think I need something to
drink but I'm feeling out of it.

1:08:02.311 --> 1:08:03.946
- Realistically you
wouldn't, I mean.

1:08:03.946 --> 1:08:04.780
What's open now?

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:06.315
Nothing, alright?

1:08:06.315 --> 1:08:07.817
You'd go back to the hotel,
you'd ask for a drink there.

1:08:07.817 --> 1:08:09.552
That's the first thing you
should ask for, a drink.

1:08:09.552 --> 1:08:12.321
- I just meant some water.

1:08:12.321 --> 1:08:14.523
- You look good, bro.

1:08:14.523 --> 1:08:16.258
Real authentic.

1:08:16.258 --> 1:08:19.094
No one else in the world
woulda done this for me.

1:08:20.296 --> 1:08:22.331
Thought about what
you're gonna say?

1:08:23.466 --> 1:08:25.734
Yeah, let your face
do the talking.

1:08:25.734 --> 1:08:28.671
(dramatic music)

1:08:40.015 --> 1:08:41.617
- They stole everything
and they just

1:08:41.617 --> 1:08:43.953
they, fuckin, just hit, look

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:46.222
look at me, look what happened.

1:08:47.389 --> 1:08:48.824
They just fucking
took everything.

1:08:48.824 --> 1:08:51.894
Stole my wallet, the
drugs, fucking everything.

1:08:55.631 --> 1:08:59.201
They came from behind, they
just knocked me clean out.

1:08:59.201 --> 1:09:00.035
What am I gonna do?

1:09:00.035 --> 1:09:01.637
It's 30,000 dollars.

1:09:01.637 --> 1:09:03.973
30 fucking thousand dollars.

1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:14.083
They took the fucking
drugs, my wallet,

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:15.818
they fucking that's 30,000.

1:09:15.818 --> 1:09:17.953
It's bad, I was knocked out.

1:09:17.953 --> 1:09:19.455
They took the drugs,
they took my wallet,

1:09:19.455 --> 1:09:21.223
they took everything.

1:09:22.291 --> 1:09:23.559
It's really bad.

1:09:23.559 --> 1:09:24.393
Fuck.

1:09:30.866 --> 1:09:32.635
I'm forever indebted to you.

1:09:32.635 --> 1:09:35.371
- [Sanja] You
don't owe me, Levi.

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:14.476
- [Wendel] How'd you pull up?

1:10:14.476 --> 1:10:15.844
- Things are looking
all right on my end.

1:10:15.844 --> 1:10:16.946
- Yeah, did you get it?

1:10:16.946 --> 1:10:18.447
- No, not yet, but I will.

1:10:18.447 --> 1:10:20.516
Tomorrow morning when the
bank has the cash ready,

1:10:20.516 --> 1:10:22.618
and I'll sell my car.

1:10:22.618 --> 1:10:25.287
- I'll believe it when I see it.

1:10:48.177 --> 1:10:49.912
- [Sanja] Can you remember
anything from last night?

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:51.480
- [Levi] Like what?

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:53.549
- [Sanja] Say you if saw the
mugger's face in the street,

1:10:53.549 --> 1:10:56.251
would you be able
to recognize it?

1:10:56.251 --> 1:10:58.354
- [Levi] I don't really
remember what they look like.

1:10:58.354 --> 1:11:01.156
- [Sanja] Yeah, everything
will be all right.

1:11:01.156 --> 1:11:02.725
Just rest up today.

1:11:02.725 --> 1:11:04.026
- [Levi] You still gonna
see your parents later?

1:11:04.026 --> 1:11:05.461
- [Sanja] Only for a bit.

1:11:05.461 --> 1:11:07.696
I have no fuel though,
can I borrow your car?

1:11:07.696 --> 1:11:09.031
- Yeah, if you find my keys.

1:11:09.031 --> 1:11:09.865
- [Sanja] Where'd you park?

1:11:09.865 --> 1:11:11.033
- Behind the building.

1:11:11.033 --> 1:11:12.267
- [Sanja] Where it's free?

1:11:12.267 --> 1:11:13.102
- Uh huh.

1:11:21.310 --> 1:11:24.079
(waves crashing)

1:11:28.317 --> 1:11:31.053
(dramatic music)

1:11:59.982 --> 1:12:02.017
(sniffs)

1:12:26.442 --> 1:12:29.178
(dramatic music)

1:12:38.253 --> 1:12:39.488
- [Jason] Wendel?

1:12:41.056 --> 1:12:41.990
Wendel?

1:12:42.758 --> 1:12:44.526
Where the fuck are ya?

1:12:44.526 --> 1:12:45.794
- I'm over here.

1:12:45.794 --> 1:12:48.063
Just had to piss for a sec.

1:12:52.534 --> 1:12:53.902
- Where the fuck are ya?

1:12:54.803 --> 1:12:56.071
- [Wendel] Here under cover.

1:12:58.006 --> 1:12:59.808
How long does it take you
to fucking piss, mate?

1:12:59.808 --> 1:13:00.909
I was calling.

1:13:01.643 --> 1:13:03.078
- [Wendel] Hey Jase,

1:13:03.078 --> 1:13:05.280
I scrounged together
some paper for you today,

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:07.616
but I'm still waiting on a
couple things to fall into place

1:13:07.616 --> 1:13:09.618
before I can give you the rest.

1:13:09.618 --> 1:13:10.452
- Yeah?

1:13:10.452 --> 1:13:11.987
How much you got?

1:13:11.987 --> 1:13:13.756
- A couple thou.

1:13:13.756 --> 1:13:15.057
(laughs)

1:13:15.057 --> 1:13:16.392
- I dig the envelope, mate.

1:13:16.392 --> 1:13:17.726
Very top secret.

1:13:17.726 --> 1:13:20.028
- I know it's not
much, brother Jase.

1:13:20.028 --> 1:13:20.929
- It depends.

1:13:20.929 --> 1:13:21.764
- [Wendel] On what?

1:13:21.764 --> 1:13:24.466
- On what you're after.

1:13:24.466 --> 1:13:26.335
- Two, three, four days.

1:13:26.335 --> 1:13:28.103
A week maybe, in case
my plans fall through.

1:13:28.103 --> 1:13:29.338
- Hang on, hang on.

1:13:29.338 --> 1:13:30.806
You're speaking
in riddles, mate.

1:13:30.806 --> 1:13:32.941
- Shit, look I'll have the rest
for you, you know I'm loyal.

1:13:32.941 --> 1:13:34.576
- I don't know what you
are right now, mate.

1:13:34.576 --> 1:13:36.979
- I'm (laughs) I'm a begger.

1:13:36.979 --> 1:13:38.847
I'm begging for an extension.

1:13:38.847 --> 1:13:42.751
- You can jump off my dick,
there's nothing to extend.

1:13:42.751 --> 1:13:44.319
- What do you mean?

1:13:45.387 --> 1:13:46.889
Why you playing, huh?

1:13:46.889 --> 1:13:47.990
- Did you not fucking hear me?

1:13:47.990 --> 1:13:48.924
- [Wendel] Why you playing?

1:13:48.924 --> 1:13:50.626
- Chill the fuck out, all right?

1:13:50.626 --> 1:13:54.096
Just settle.
- But I haven't paid none.

1:13:54.096 --> 1:13:55.297
- Fuckin hell.

1:13:55.297 --> 1:13:56.565
- [Wendel] What do
you want from me, huh?

1:13:56.565 --> 1:13:58.534
Are you fuckin geeking mate?

1:13:59.835 --> 1:14:01.970
I'm just trying
to sort shit out.

1:14:01.970 --> 1:14:03.739
- There's nothing to
fucking sort, mate.

1:14:03.739 --> 1:14:04.973
Don't piss me off,
and don't fuck

1:14:04.973 --> 1:14:05.841
with those customers, all right?

1:14:05.841 --> 1:14:07.109
- I'm straight.

1:14:07.109 --> 1:14:09.378
- Have you got
Alzheimer's, buddy?

1:14:09.378 --> 1:14:11.346
Have you got Alzheimer's?

1:14:11.346 --> 1:14:14.116
Have you got
fucking Alzheimer's?

1:14:15.984 --> 1:14:17.953
- You fronted me the
chalk, all right?

1:14:17.953 --> 1:14:21.857
I clearly remember meeting
with you and picking up bulk.

1:14:21.857 --> 1:14:23.025
- Bulk?

1:14:23.025 --> 1:14:25.561
I fronted you a bit ages ago,

1:14:25.561 --> 1:14:27.496
but you fucking paid, all right?

1:14:27.496 --> 1:14:29.665
Came and got that white
car you left as collateral.

1:14:29.665 --> 1:14:31.500
- Yes, Sanja's car, right?

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:32.501
Sanja's car.

1:14:33.869 --> 1:14:35.637
No, this was another time.

1:14:35.637 --> 1:14:37.639
This was more
recent, real recent.

1:14:37.639 --> 1:14:40.709
- You got the usual two
G bags, some Sildenafils,

1:14:40.709 --> 1:14:42.811
some fucking cock rockers.

1:14:42.811 --> 1:14:44.847
Paid me back a week
later, end of story.

1:14:44.847 --> 1:14:46.148
Fucking done.

1:14:46.148 --> 1:14:48.183
(voices echoing)

1:14:50.085 --> 1:14:51.320
[Jason] Fuck it.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.889
Pay me what you
think you owe me.

1:14:53.889 --> 1:14:55.891
I don't give a shit, eh.

1:14:57.259 --> 1:15:00.095
How much you gonna donate?

1:15:00.095 --> 1:15:02.331
- [Wendel] It's yours, have it.

1:15:02.331 --> 1:15:04.099
- It was a joke.

1:15:04.099 --> 1:15:06.835
- No no no, for your troubles.

1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:13.976
- What are you having?

1:15:27.589 --> 1:15:30.826
- I'm sorry Jase eh,
it's been rough lately.

1:15:30.826 --> 1:15:32.828
I haven't been thinking.

1:15:34.329 --> 1:15:37.432
- Listen mate, it's the
first and the last time

1:15:37.432 --> 1:15:38.834
and don't fucking forget it.

1:15:38.834 --> 1:15:40.002
[Wendel] Yeah.

1:15:41.770 --> 1:15:44.239
- Cheers for not stringing
me along or anything, eh.

1:15:44.239 --> 1:15:47.075
My life just got a
whole lot easier.

1:15:47.075 --> 1:15:49.077
- Ah, you woulda caught
on eventually, man.

1:15:49.077 --> 1:15:50.712
- No.

1:15:50.712 --> 1:15:51.647
- Maybe I shouldn't have opened

1:15:51.647 --> 1:15:53.949
my big fucking mouth then.

1:15:53.949 --> 1:15:56.151
I'm too bloody honest.

1:15:56.151 --> 1:15:58.320
I'm in the wrong business.

1:16:03.692 --> 1:16:07.229
- Maybe I could get
some sleeping tablets
off you instead,

1:16:07.229 --> 1:16:08.397
of the shards.

1:16:08.397 --> 1:16:09.631
- I think you might
need it, mate.

1:16:09.631 --> 1:16:10.866
- [Wendel] Got any benzos?

1:16:10.866 --> 1:16:12.100
- [Jase] Yeah, you
want anything else?

1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:13.335
Like a sock?

1:16:14.469 --> 1:16:16.905
- I'm sure he's a
good bloke, all right?

1:16:16.905 --> 1:16:18.640
Not a bad seed like his brother.

1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.409
- [Sanja] Who gave
you that impression?

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:21.376
- I'm sorry.

1:16:21.376 --> 1:16:23.312
- [Sanja] You're sorry?

1:16:24.713 --> 1:16:26.581
Well, anyways guys, I
came over here to tell you

1:16:26.581 --> 1:16:29.418
that we've decided
to move to Melbourne.

1:16:29.418 --> 1:16:31.453
Just for a semester.
- What?

1:16:31.453 --> 1:16:34.022
- [Sanja] Okay, like now's
as good as time as ever.

1:16:34.022 --> 1:16:36.959
- [Mom] That's a, quite
a bombshell, Sanja.

1:16:36.959 --> 1:16:38.961
- You've never been,
you'll probably hate it.

1:16:38.961 --> 1:16:40.162
- Exactly.

1:16:40.162 --> 1:16:42.030
- I might hate
it, I'll find out.

1:16:42.030 --> 1:16:43.765
I might like it too.

1:16:43.765 --> 1:16:45.300
- So you're not
gonna study anymore?

1:16:45.300 --> 1:16:47.069
- Yes, Dad, of course
I'm still studying.

1:16:47.069 --> 1:16:48.704
- Where you studying?

1:16:48.704 --> 1:16:52.441
- Guys, this is something
that I've decided to do, okay?

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:56.445
I only wanted to visit,
I'm not discussing this.

1:16:59.247 --> 1:17:02.651
- I'm just happy you're
keeping up with your studies.

1:17:02.651 --> 1:17:03.852
That's all I'm saying.

1:17:03.852 --> 1:17:05.354
- [Mom] We'll just
have to visit.

1:17:05.354 --> 1:17:07.356
- [Sanja] I didn't mean
to make it awkward, guys.

1:17:07.356 --> 1:17:08.190
I'll be back.

1:17:08.190 --> 1:17:09.658
It's just a semester.

1:17:09.658 --> 1:17:11.560
- Just gonna miss
you, that's all.

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:13.962
- [Sanja] I'll miss you guys.

1:17:15.330 --> 1:17:16.898
Miss the olives.

1:17:16.898 --> 1:17:18.066
- Don't start.

1:17:18.934 --> 1:17:19.468
[Vesna] Oh my god shutup.

1:17:19.468 --> 1:17:20.168
(laughs)

1:17:20.936 --> 1:17:22.371
[Dad] Where is he then?

1:17:22.371 --> 1:17:24.506
- [Sanja] Back at the hotel.

1:17:24.506 --> 1:17:27.409
- [Vesna] Where are you
staying in Melbourne?

1:17:27.409 --> 1:17:28.910
- Haven't decided yet?

1:17:29.644 --> 1:17:30.045
Like not even the area?

1:17:31.213 --> 1:17:32.614
- [Sanja] Yes we have, Dad.

1:17:32.614 --> 1:17:33.749
- Are you actually
going, though, seriously?

1:17:33.749 --> 1:17:35.217
- Yes, we are going.

1:17:35.217 --> 1:17:36.651
There's a few streets and
places that we're looking at.

1:17:36.651 --> 1:17:37.519
- [Dad] You have money?

1:17:37.519 --> 1:17:38.353
- Yes, Dad.

1:17:38.353 --> 1:17:39.588
Of course I have money.

1:17:39.588 --> 1:17:40.822
I've been working
over the summer.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:41.990
- You're not gonna get married.

1:17:41.990 --> 1:17:43.258
- You don't know
where you're staying,

1:17:43.258 --> 1:17:44.426
you don't know where
you're gonna study.

1:17:44.426 --> 1:17:45.660
- Sorry.

1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:46.628
- You just know who
you're going with.

1:17:46.628 --> 1:17:47.863
- [Sanja] Yes.
- That's it.

1:17:47.863 --> 1:17:49.131
- [Sanja] Being
spontaneous, Dad.

1:17:49.131 --> 1:17:50.499
- [Dad] Just like
your old man, eh?

1:17:50.499 --> 1:17:52.768
- [Mom] Adventure,
honey, remember that?

1:17:52.768 --> 1:17:54.669
- [Sanja] Growing up, isn't it?

1:17:54.669 --> 1:17:56.405
- [Dad] 20 years ago.

1:17:57.806 --> 1:18:00.642
- We can Skype, I'll call
you guys every night.

1:18:01.410 --> 1:18:02.911
- [Dad] No you won't.

1:18:02.911 --> 1:18:04.112
(laughs)

1:18:04.112 --> 1:18:05.580
- Yes, I will.

1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:08.183
Maybe not every night,
maybe every second night.

1:18:08.183 --> 1:18:09.985
Are you gonna Skype me too?

1:18:09.985 --> 1:18:11.153
- No.

1:18:11.153 --> 1:18:13.255
I've got exams, I got WACE.

1:18:13.955 --> 1:18:15.390
I hate year 12.

1:18:15.390 --> 1:18:17.225
(laughs)

1:18:17.225 --> 1:18:18.960
- [Sanja] You're nearly
done, you'll be fine.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:20.662
- Yeah, we'll see.

1:18:20.662 --> 1:18:21.863
I'll come over after.

1:18:21.863 --> 1:18:24.633
Maybe I'll just leave,
maybe I'll leave.

1:18:24.633 --> 1:18:25.867
- We'll talk about this.

1:18:25.867 --> 1:18:27.869
- I'll go to like
Bermuda University.

1:18:27.869 --> 1:18:30.272
I'll never come back.

1:18:30.272 --> 1:18:32.641
You can choose
who you miss more.

1:18:32.641 --> 1:18:33.709
- Here she goes.

1:18:33.709 --> 1:18:34.609
- [Sanja] That's mean.

1:18:34.609 --> 1:18:36.611
(laughs)

1:18:38.313 --> 1:18:40.415
- [Vesna] As long as Levi's
not there, I hate Levi.

1:18:40.415 --> 1:18:41.516
- Ves.

1:18:41.516 --> 1:18:42.718
- I'm just saying, like he's...

1:18:42.718 --> 1:18:45.187
- Yeah, you've made
that very clear.

1:18:45.187 --> 1:18:46.588
Many times.

1:18:46.588 --> 1:18:48.023
- I just don't like staying
with your boyfriends

1:18:48.023 --> 1:18:51.126
because they're all weird
and like drink beer.

1:18:51.126 --> 1:18:52.060
- [Sanja] You don't
have to like him,

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:54.463
you're not the one dating him.

1:18:56.832 --> 1:18:58.900
- [Vesna] I don't have anything
super super against him,

1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:01.903
all I'm saying is if I went
over, and I do come visit,

1:19:01.903 --> 1:19:03.171
I'd rather stay with you,

1:19:03.171 --> 1:19:04.372
not stay with you
and your boyfriend

1:19:04.372 --> 1:19:05.707
cause then it will
just feel like weird.

1:19:05.707 --> 1:19:06.741
That's not weird.

1:19:06.741 --> 1:19:07.976
Dad, that's not weird.

1:19:07.976 --> 1:19:08.944
- [Dad] You can come
over with us then.

1:19:08.944 --> 1:19:09.878
You can stay with us.

1:19:09.878 --> 1:19:11.880
Easy, it's not that hard.

1:19:13.682 --> 1:19:16.985
- [Vesna] That's all I'm
saying, don't do the angry face.

1:19:24.993 --> 1:19:25.961
- Wendel.

1:19:54.222 --> 1:19:55.056
Hmm.

1:20:11.973 --> 1:20:14.709
(dramatic music)

1:21:32.954 --> 1:21:35.557
(loud banging)

1:21:42.897 --> 1:21:46.001
(bathroom shower on)

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.010
(dramatic music)

1:22:05.420 --> 1:22:06.721
- [Levi] Sanja?

1:22:06.721 --> 1:22:07.923
Is that you?

1:22:11.693 --> 1:22:14.429
(dramatic music)

1:22:28.610 --> 1:22:29.811
- [Levi] Wendel.

1:22:29.811 --> 1:22:31.413
- How's it going, bro?

1:22:31.413 --> 1:22:32.347
Woo!

1:22:32.347 --> 1:22:33.615
- [Levi] Have you seen Sanja?

1:22:33.615 --> 1:22:34.582
- [Wendel] I've got
some good news, bro.

1:22:34.582 --> 1:22:36.418
- Have you seen Sanja?

1:22:37.519 --> 1:22:38.386
- Why the fuck
would I of seen her?

1:22:38.386 --> 1:22:39.854
- She came here.

1:22:39.854 --> 1:22:41.222
She found the bag.

1:22:41.222 --> 1:22:42.657
- She didn't come here.

1:22:42.657 --> 1:22:43.825
- I don't know, she went
through the bin or something.

1:22:43.825 --> 1:22:45.060
She found it.

1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:46.828
Why would she come here
to search through it?

1:22:46.828 --> 1:22:48.730
- It wasn't in the bin.

1:22:49.931 --> 1:22:51.666
I put it upstairs, I
put it in your room.

1:22:52.867 --> 1:22:54.369
- I didn't tell you
to put it in my room.

1:22:54.369 --> 1:22:56.004
What happened to
leaving no traces?

1:22:56.004 --> 1:22:58.573
- It's taken care of.

1:22:58.573 --> 1:23:00.342
It's all good.

1:23:00.342 --> 1:23:01.810
It was a nice try.

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:13.955
Oh, fucking hell, bro.

1:23:15.190 --> 1:23:16.391
You're fucking
cleaning this shit up.

1:23:16.391 --> 1:23:18.960
- Why the fuck did
you put it in my room?

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:21.229
What happened to
leaving no traces?

1:23:21.229 --> 1:23:23.198
- I didn't know she was
gonna fucking come here,

1:23:23.198 --> 1:23:24.666
up here looking in your room.

1:23:25.133 --> 1:23:25.867
Find it.

1:23:28.503 --> 1:23:30.605
Doesn't belong in
my kitchen anyway.

1:23:30.605 --> 1:23:32.007
I'll get the vacuum,
you're cleaning it up, Lee.

1:23:32.007 --> 1:23:33.508
- She left me because
of you, you know that?

1:23:33.508 --> 1:23:35.677
You and your cleaning disorder,
you fucking crackhead.

1:23:35.677 --> 1:23:37.312
Do you realize you've
ruined everything?

1:23:37.312 --> 1:23:40.749
- Don't talk to me like that
in my own fucking house, boy.

1:23:47.055 --> 1:23:50.892
(heavy breathing and choking)

1:24:02.737 --> 1:24:04.906
(gasping)

1:24:22.924 --> 1:24:25.760
(heavy breathing)

1:24:38.773 --> 1:24:42.043
(gasping and coughing)

1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:48.716
(heavy breathing)

1:25:08.203 --> 1:25:10.939
(dramatic music)

1:25:47.075 --> 1:25:49.477
You still fight like a bitch.

1:25:51.012 --> 1:25:54.349
- Is it all right if I stay
here for a few more days?

1:25:56.451 --> 1:25:57.819
- Yeah.

1:25:57.819 --> 1:25:58.686
- Cheers.

1:26:03.925 --> 1:26:06.995
- Want me to call
up Tash or Monique?

1:26:11.065 --> 1:26:13.401
You're not getting her back.

1:26:15.436 --> 1:26:17.739
- I'll get her back

1:26:17.739 --> 1:26:20.275
after we sort out your debt.

1:26:41.496 --> 1:26:44.332
(dramatic music)
