Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:02.341 --> 00:04.658
I know you love to invent
things, Dr. Hodgins, but you do

00:04.659 --> 00:06.400
not have permission to do that here.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.577
WARREN: <i> You should totally</i>
invent an unbreakable beaker.

00:08.578 --> 00:10.828
You are gonna make
the Jeffersonian a mint.

00:10.829 --> 00:13.206
Jeffersonian wants nothing to do
with my little side project.

00:13.207 --> 00:14.098
This is ours.

00:14.122 --> 00:15.337
Arastoo, what's going on?

00:15.338 --> 00:17.638
It's my brother,
Hamid. In Iran.

00:17.674 --> 00:20.408
He's sick. I have to go back,
make sure he's getting the best care...

00:20.443 --> 00:23.077
Can't go back, you were exiled.

00:23.113 --> 00:26.047
I booked a flight, Cam.
It leaves in a few hours.

00:26.082 --> 00:28.249
Any big emotional change,
even good, can

00:28.284 --> 00:30.017
trigger a relapse
with an addict.

00:30.053 --> 00:32.186
I know these guys, okay? I've
been playing with them. I know

00:32.222 --> 00:34.655
their tells. We get the evidence
you need and I make the arrest.

00:34.691 --> 00:36.512
I don't understand--
he just read your text.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.693
He might have too good

00:37.694 --> 00:40.828
<i>of a hand.</i>
He's an addict.

00:40.864 --> 00:42.196
And you checked in
with your sponsor?

00:42.232 --> 00:44.465
Why do I feel like
I'm being interrogated?

00:44.501 --> 00:47.368
Listen, I need to put
$200 on the Cardinals.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.608
Step on it,
you pathetic weaklings!

00:53.007 --> 00:54.919
My grandmother
can move faster than you,

00:54.920 --> 00:57.120
and she's been dead 20 years!

00:57.156 --> 00:59.890
I thought this was supposed
to be an exercise boot camp,

00:59.925 --> 01:01.258
not a real boot camp.

01:01.293 --> 01:02.659
You want to get rid
of your muffin-top

01:02.695 --> 01:03.994
or not?
At this point,

01:04.029 --> 01:06.096
lipo seems less painful.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.000
You. Suzie Soccer Mom.
On your feet.

01:10.035 --> 01:12.803
Gather around, pansies.
Double time, double time.

01:12.838 --> 01:14.071
(panting)
Okay.

01:14.106 --> 01:16.039
Now... Suzie Q here's

01:16.075 --> 01:18.041
gonna show us all how to
scale the climbing wall.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.643
You want... Maybe someone
else should go first.

01:19.678 --> 01:21.612
Did you or did
you not sign up

01:21.647 --> 01:23.947
for this boot camp exercise class?
Sir, I did, it's just,

01:23.983 --> 01:26.583
it's so tall and I'm so...
Save your whining

01:26.619 --> 01:28.385
for the PTA and let
me see you shift

01:28.420 --> 01:30.454
that ten-ton truck
of yours into gear.

01:30.489 --> 01:32.055
Move it, soldier!

01:32.091 --> 01:34.758
Let me see you put some
wiggle in that jiggle!

01:34.793 --> 01:36.293
Okay.
Come on.

01:36.328 --> 01:39.396
(grunting)

01:39.431 --> 01:41.098
WOMAN:
Come on, girl.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.133
You got it.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.100
You're almost there.

01:43.135 --> 01:45.402
Come on.
(whoops)

01:45.437 --> 01:46.837
Yeah.

01:46.872 --> 01:48.872
There. I did it.
MAN: Good job.

01:48.907 --> 01:50.440
Great, nice.
Whoa,

01:50.476 --> 01:52.743
oh, my... whoa!
(screams)

01:52.778 --> 01:56.079
Oh!
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.781
What now?
Oh, God.

01:57.816 --> 01:59.750
Someone get a boo-boo?

01:59.785 --> 02:02.953
(whimpering)

02:06.158 --> 02:08.892
I just wanted to lose
the baby weight.

02:08.926 --> 02:11.094
All right, all right,
it's-it's gonna be okay.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.698
Look, it's gonna be okay.
Come on. (grunts)

02:14.733 --> 02:16.433
Whoa, look at that, huh?

02:16.468 --> 02:19.403
To celebrate the Flyers' win
last night, huh?

02:19.438 --> 02:20.871
Dad's famous pancakes.

02:20.906 --> 02:22.272
Can you tell me what that is?

02:22.307 --> 02:24.274
It looks like a
pelvic girdle.

02:24.309 --> 02:26.410
Pelv... What?
No, no, no, it's Mickey Mouse.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.445
Oh, she's right,
Booth. There's

02:28.480 --> 02:30.514
the pubis there,
and the ilia.

02:30.549 --> 02:32.516
No, no, don't listen to your
mommy. See the... See the

02:32.551 --> 02:33.750
mouse ears right there?
You see that?

02:33.786 --> 02:35.252
Booth, there's
nothing wrong

02:35.287 --> 02:36.653
with Christine
showing an interest

02:36.689 --> 02:38.055
in human anatomy.
She's four years old.

02:38.090 --> 02:40.457
She should be, you know,
interested in maple syrup

02:40.492 --> 02:42.125
and cartoon mice.
Look, Mommy, I'm eating

02:42.161 --> 02:44.227
the sacrum.
Uh, technically,

02:44.263 --> 02:45.662
sweetheart, that's the ischium,

02:45.698 --> 02:48.231
but very good.
Mommy and Me anatomy.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.934
Isn't that fun?

There's no such thing

03:09.755 --> 03:11.855
Your teacher shouldn't
be singing that.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.391
The chest is comprised
of the hyoid,

03:14.426 --> 03:17.561
the clavicle, sternum,
and-and the ribs.

03:17.596 --> 03:19.496
Bones, she's four years ol...
(phones ding)

03:19.531 --> 03:21.531
Oh, all right, got a job.
Ooh.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.201
Body was found buried
in a shallow grave

03:24.236 --> 03:26.403
in the woods at Leakin Park.
Murder

03:26.438 --> 03:28.672
and pancakes. What a way to
start the morning. We can drop

03:28.707 --> 03:30.741
Christine off at the preschool
on the way. All right?

03:30.776 --> 03:33.210
Can we sing the bones song
in the car, Daddy?

03:33.245 --> 03:35.245
Well, why don't we stick
with "Wheels on the Bus"?

03:35.280 --> 03:37.180
I don't know anything that
rhymes with clavicle, do you?

03:37.216 --> 03:39.549
No. Exactly.

03:41.153 --> 03:44.554
(sirens wailing, indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:47.459 --> 03:50.060
The narrow pelvic inlet
and flat profile

03:50.095 --> 03:51.495
of the skull indicate

03:51.530 --> 03:53.290
the victim was a Caucasian male,
but it seems

03:53.298 --> 03:55.899
that his body was crushed

03:55.934 --> 03:57.801
by some kind of weight.
That

03:57.836 --> 04:01.171
would be the woman who
landed on him over there.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.973
Mm-mm.
BRENNAN: Oh. Well,

04:03.008 --> 04:05.342
separating the peri
from postmortem injuries

04:05.377 --> 04:06.910
will be quite challenging.

04:06.945 --> 04:09.312
What's that smell?
Uh, someone doused

04:09.348 --> 04:10.747
the victim
in corrosive chemicals.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.482
So it was a body dump.
Yeah, but I've never

04:12.518 --> 04:14.584
seen this pattern
of decomposition before.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.386
HODGINS:
It looks like a mixture of acids

04:16.421 --> 04:18.889
and bases, further decomposing
the tissue in some areas,

04:18.923 --> 04:21.158
while neutralizing it in others.
Great, so it was

04:21.192 --> 04:23.860
an amateur job. That's good for us.
I'll run an analysis

04:23.896 --> 04:25.456
back at the lab,
see if I can figure out

04:25.464 --> 04:27.130
what kind of corrosives
were used.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.199
Great.
Uh, did you just say that...

04:29.234 --> 04:31.001
the dirt had
acid in it?

04:31.036 --> 04:32.850
Probably, but the damage
could have been caused...

04:32.905 --> 04:34.538
...by a caustic base...
Ladies. Your clothes have chemicals on them.

04:34.573 --> 04:36.706
You need to take immediate
evasive measures.

04:36.742 --> 04:38.909
Now! Get naked!

04:38.944 --> 04:40.777
I mean, is this
really necessary?

04:40.813 --> 04:42.646
Not at all.

05:17.841 --> 05:20.487
Well that woman from boot camp
really did some damage.

05:20.511 --> 05:22.678
I agree.
There are fractures to the ribs,

05:22.679 --> 05:26.147
clavicle, and the T6
through T9 vertebrae.

05:26.182 --> 05:28.650
And his clothes are covered
in food stains.

05:28.685 --> 05:30.285
Ah, it just
keeps getting

05:30.320 --> 05:32.787
better and better.
Evidence of diffuse idiopathic

05:32.822 --> 05:36.291
skeletal hypertosis
on the victim's spine

05:36.326 --> 05:38.760
suggests he was diabetic.
Diabetes

05:38.795 --> 05:41.729
makes sense, given
the extra organs I found. Uh,

05:41.765 --> 05:44.666
two pancreases and three

05:44.701 --> 05:46.334
kidneys, to be exact.

05:46.369 --> 05:47.969
Isn't it "pancrei"?

05:48.004 --> 05:50.772
Pancreases.
"Pancreata" is also acceptable.

05:50.807 --> 05:51.906
Oh, this
scar tissue

05:51.942 --> 05:53.441
would indicate that the victim

05:53.476 --> 05:55.843
had both a kidney
and a pancreas transplant.

05:55.879 --> 05:57.578
Oh, I can use
the United

05:57.614 --> 05:59.314
Network of Organ Sharing
database

05:59.349 --> 06:01.316
to see if I can find a match.

06:03.787 --> 06:06.421
Yes. That's what
I'm talking about,

06:06.456 --> 06:08.423
baby. Yeah.
AUBREY: You look happy.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.425
Oh, yeah, I just got
a, uh, good report

06:10.460 --> 06:12.660
from Christine's,
uh, preschool teacher.

06:12.696 --> 06:14.176
She did really good.
You know, parents

06:14.197 --> 06:15.663
get, you know, excited
about stuff like that.

06:15.699 --> 06:17.098
Well, in
that case,

06:17.133 --> 06:19.367
got a little coffee,
donuts to celebrate.

06:19.402 --> 06:22.136
Sure, yeah. What's that? That...
Oh, uh,

06:22.172 --> 06:24.339
just a, uh, egg sandwich
and some hash browns. Little

06:24.374 --> 06:26.240

Well, you're not gonna want to eat

06:26.276 --> 06:28.609
after you see this. Oh,
let me hold it. You got grease

06:28.645 --> 06:30.712
all over your hands.

06:32.282 --> 06:34.248
Our victim's Chili Reuben?

06:34.284 --> 06:36.250
Yeah. Figured you'd know him.
Yeah, but who doesn't?

06:36.286 --> 06:38.119
<i>Gettin' Spicy with Chili Reuben</i>

06:38.154 --> 06:39.887

06:39.923 --> 06:42.790
I've never seen it.
Seriously?

06:42.826 --> 06:45.026
Seriously. If I want to watch
a guy put down a side of ribs,

06:45.061 --> 06:46.995
two milkshakes and a double
cheeseburger in half an hour,

06:47.030 --> 06:49.263

Thank you.

06:49.299 --> 06:51.666
Here, I'll show you.
Easy-- you got your greasy paws

MAN: This week on <i> Gettin'</i>

06:56.873 --> 06:58.940
you're gonna want
to fasten your seatbelts,

06:58.975 --> 07:00.842

07:00.877 --> 07:04.779

I know how to cook 'em.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.417
And I know how to eat 'em.
And there isn't

07:09.452 --> 07:13.388
a greasy spoon in this
country I haven't hit. Mmm.

07:13.423 --> 07:16.257
God, that turkey leg looks so good.
All right,

07:16.292 --> 07:17.792
let's go back to the Web site.

07:17.827 --> 07:20.528
Ah, here's something.

07:20.563 --> 07:22.130
Look at the Twitter feed, huh?

07:22.165 --> 07:23.464
Supposedly
he was in D.C.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.800
last week shooting
a new episode.

07:25.835 --> 07:27.502
I can't believe I missed him.

07:27.537 --> 07:29.337
When he wasn't dead.
Tell you what, maybe

07:29.372 --> 07:31.172
the producer's still in town
and we can talk to him.

07:31.207 --> 07:32.607
Oh.
It's a good lead.

07:32.642 --> 07:34.842
Hey, you got a minute?

07:34.878 --> 07:37.178
Uh, hang on. I'm
cross-referencing the chemicals

07:37.213 --> 07:39.514
you found on the victim to see
what products might match.

07:39.549 --> 07:41.282
Okay.

07:41.317 --> 07:42.617
Shoot.

07:42.652 --> 07:44.852
I got a call today
from a company that

07:44.888 --> 07:47.021
wants to manufacture
the honeycomb-structured

07:47.057 --> 07:49.424
ultra rubber covering
that I invented.

07:49.459 --> 07:52.226
Oh. Honey, that's amazing.
Do you think it's legit?

07:52.262 --> 07:54.529
Well, I'm having a lawyer
look over the offer

07:54.564 --> 07:56.597
now, but if this checks out,

07:56.633 --> 07:58.132
this could be huge, Angie.

07:58.168 --> 07:59.600
Yeah?

07:59.636 --> 08:01.102
What do you think,
like, money huge?

08:01.137 --> 08:02.437
They're only offering
a small advance

08:02.472 --> 08:04.238
up front, but I will get

08:04.274 --> 08:06.074
one dollar for every unit sold,

08:06.109 --> 08:07.542
and they are projecting

08:07.577 --> 08:09.777
to ship 20 million

08:09.813 --> 08:10.945
units to start.

08:10.980 --> 08:13.147
Oh... Oh, my God.

08:13.183 --> 08:14.482
20 million?

08:14.517 --> 08:15.917
Yeah.

08:15.952 --> 08:17.952
Whoa.
(laughs)

08:17.987 --> 08:19.854
Hold on. Does, um...

08:19.889 --> 08:23.257
Okay. Wow.
Does Cam know about this?

08:23.293 --> 08:24.559
I mean, how do you
think she's gonna

08:24.594 --> 08:26.027
react? If she
hadn't prevented you

08:26.062 --> 08:27.261
from working on it here,

08:27.297 --> 08:28.896
the... the Jeffersonian

08:28.932 --> 08:31.065
would be getting
most of that money.

08:31.101 --> 08:32.799
Yeah.

08:32.836 --> 08:34.669
You know what,
let's just wait and see

08:34.703 --> 08:36.203
if it all works out first.

08:36.239 --> 08:37.472
Yeah.
Right?

08:37.506 --> 08:38.905
Yeah.

08:38.942 --> 08:40.575
(computer beeps)

08:40.610 --> 08:43.845
Okay. So... looks like
the sodium hydroxide

08:43.880 --> 08:45.947
and sulfuric acid
came from commercial

08:45.982 --> 08:47.181
cleaning substances.

08:47.217 --> 08:48.749
Drain cleaners.

08:48.785 --> 08:50.351
They're both
common brands,

08:50.386 --> 08:52.920
so that's not
gonna help us much.

08:54.524 --> 08:56.491
20 million units.

08:56.526 --> 08:58.526
Just saying.

08:58.561 --> 09:01.429
I can't believe Chili is dead.

09:01.464 --> 09:04.398
We worked together for many years.
On the show,

09:04.434 --> 09:06.467
Chili made it seem
like the whole crew was family.

09:06.503 --> 09:08.169
Like that one
episode, season two,

09:08.204 --> 09:09.737
the Spicemobile
slid into the ditch

09:09.772 --> 09:12.473
'cause of all the cooking oil.

09:12.509 --> 09:15.510
Yeah. So you guys
were close, though?

09:15.545 --> 09:17.512
Chili and I had
a real yin and yang

09:17.547 --> 09:18.946
thing going on, you know?

09:18.982 --> 09:20.081
I was the calm one,

09:20.116 --> 09:21.782
Chili was the-the boisterous

09:21.818 --> 09:23.985
one. We were always friends.
Right. When was the last

09:24.020 --> 09:25.953
time you saw him?
Friday afternoon.

09:25.989 --> 09:28.656
We spent the day shooting
at different diners in D.C.

09:28.691 --> 09:31.926
After we wrapped,
Chili got into the Spicemobile

09:31.961 --> 09:33.594
and drove off
to do his own thing.

09:33.630 --> 09:35.963
Well, we found his car keys
in his pocket and we already

09:35.999 --> 09:38.366
put out a, uh, search on the vehicle.
Are you aware

09:38.401 --> 09:40.801
of any enemies he may have had?
Oh, look, Chili, he...

09:40.837 --> 09:43.171
he may have had a big
personality, but, uh...

09:43.206 --> 09:45.039
And he could be
a bit of a hothead.

09:45.074 --> 09:47.608
I'm not gonna deny that,
but people generally liked him.

09:47.644 --> 09:49.343
Okay, look, we're
gonna have to take a look

09:49.379 --> 09:51.012
at all the tapes that
you shot while you were

09:51.047 --> 09:53.347
here in D.C.
Oh, yeah. Be my guest. Uh, there's

09:53.383 --> 09:55.616
a ton of footage because
we haven't cut it together yet.

09:55.652 --> 09:57.518
Bet there's some
amazing stuff in there.

09:57.554 --> 10:01.255
I'm happy to go through that.
For the team.

10:02.492 --> 10:03.991
Why don't you go back
to your monitor?

10:04.027 --> 10:05.092
Right.

10:05.128 --> 10:06.794
(electric whirring)

10:06.829 --> 10:09.397
Oh. Mmm.

10:09.432 --> 10:13.201
Best fish tacos
this side of the Mississippi.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.169
Mm-hmm.
Up high. Yeah.

10:15.205 --> 10:17.471
He's right,
that place is amazing.

10:17.507 --> 10:19.607
(whirring)

10:19.642 --> 10:22.510
MAN (distorted):
Rolling. And action.

10:25.048 --> 10:27.748
Oh, yeah.

10:27.784 --> 10:31.552
Chicken and waffle ice cream
might sound like these guys are

10:31.588 --> 10:34.255
winging it, but trust me,
this stuff is mmm,

10:34.290 --> 10:35.756
mmm, mmm, finger

10:35.792 --> 10:38.626
lickin' good.
Well, that's interesting.

10:38.661 --> 10:41.340
Oh, I think they deliver
if you want to split a pint.

10:41.364 --> 10:41.930
No, no, I'm

10:41.931 --> 10:44.765
talking about Chili's earring.
Does he always wear that?

10:44.801 --> 10:47.401
Oh, yeah. That's his signature--
the ruby chili pepper.

10:47.437 --> 10:50.171
Well, it wasn't in any
of the evidence collected

10:50.206 --> 10:52.139
at the crime scene.
Well, maybe a crazed fan

10:52.175 --> 10:53.841
got him? I'll have the techs

10:53.876 --> 10:56.244
check the dump site again.

10:56.279 --> 10:57.979
BOOTH: <i> Judging from the review</i>
<i>on Chili's Twitter feed,</i>

10:58.014 --> 10:59.247
<i>the guy didn't pull</i>

10:59.282 --> 11:00.548
any punches.
Read that one.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.116
Perhaps one of the local
restauranteurs

11:02.151 --> 11:03.317
decided to take
their revenge?

11:03.353 --> 11:04.785
Mm-mm. Not in the D.C. area.

11:04.821 --> 11:07.488
According to all the footage
that we have so far,

11:07.523 --> 11:10.524
Chili, he's given nothing
but positive reviews.

11:12.428 --> 11:14.862
You still looking at,
uh, the Twitter feed?

11:14.897 --> 11:16.364
No. I'm-I'm looking

11:16.399 --> 11:18.733
for words that rhyme with...

11:18.768 --> 11:21.002
lachrymal, trapezium and...

11:21.037 --> 11:22.470
pisiform.
Right.

11:22.505 --> 11:24.305
Sorry I asked.
Well, I want

11:24.340 --> 11:27.508
to compose an anatomically
correct bones song

11:27.543 --> 11:29.110
for Christine,
but songwriting

11:29.145 --> 11:31.178
is more difficult
than I thought.

11:31.214 --> 11:33.347
Well, it would help
if you were musically inclined.

11:33.383 --> 11:36.083
Well, what I need is a bone
that rhymes with ethmoid.

11:36.119 --> 11:37.399
What about scaphoid?
More coffee?

11:37.420 --> 11:38.919
(chuckles):
Wow. Hey, wow,

11:38.955 --> 11:41.322
you speak squint, JoAnne.
Think I spent ten years

11:41.357 --> 11:43.691
serving her lunch without
picking up a thing or two?

11:43.726 --> 11:45.726
Oh, by the way,
uh, sphenoid and cuboid

11:45.762 --> 11:47.461
would also work.
Thank you, JoAnne.

11:47.497 --> 11:50.698
Although, I do recall asking
for no olives in my salad.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.733
Ah.
Oh, I-I'm sorry

11:52.769 --> 11:54.602
about that, Doc.
I mean, I would have Frankie

11:54.637 --> 11:57.138
make you another one, except
he's kind of in a foul mood.

11:57.173 --> 11:59.307
FRANKIE:
Hurry up! I need those fries!

11:59.342 --> 12:02.143
You... you know,
I'll pick 'em out for you.

12:02.178 --> 12:04.078
Thank you.
Okay, here we go. That's... my...

12:04.113 --> 12:05.913
(phone ringing)
Oh, phone call.

12:05.948 --> 12:07.815
I got it.
I got it. Um...

12:07.850 --> 12:09.517
It's Aubrey.
Aubrey, you solve the case?

12:09.552 --> 12:11.552
Of the six greasy spoons
that Chili visited

12:11.587 --> 12:14.722
in D.C., he gave all but one
a positive review.

12:14.757 --> 12:16.357
So we got a motive?

12:16.392 --> 12:18.826
Yeah, and it's one
that you're not gonna like.

12:18.861 --> 12:20.661
Listen to this.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.363
"The best burgers
in the district"?

12:22.398 --> 12:24.965
Maybe if you had
your taste buds removed!

12:25.001 --> 12:26.033
(spits)

12:26.069 --> 12:27.535
The Royal Diner should be

12:27.570 --> 12:29.403
charbroiled and fed to dogs!

12:29.439 --> 12:30.604
Right. Thanks.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.907
What's wrong, Booth?

12:32.942 --> 12:36.811
Well, we had a lead in the case,
so we may have a suspect.

12:36.846 --> 12:38.446
Why do you look so disappointed?

12:38.481 --> 12:39.847
Because, um...

12:39.882 --> 12:41.515
(whispers):
'cause it's Frankie.

12:41.551 --> 12:44.151
FRANKIE: How many times
do I have tell you?!

12:44.187 --> 12:47.154
Keep your mouth shut
and do what I say!

12:47.190 --> 12:48.989
Now get back to work!

12:49.025 --> 12:50.925
That's... Wow.

12:52.662 --> 12:54.628
Frankie?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.159
Order up!
Adam and Eve on a raft, wrecked.

12:59.981 --> 13:01.213
Cowboy with spurs.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.615
Cowboy with spurs!

13:02.650 --> 13:05.351
Would you look at this--
my two best customers.

13:05.386 --> 13:07.386
Good to see you, Frankie, yep.
I'd like to visit,

13:07.421 --> 13:10.689
but... lunch rush.
BOOTH: I really hate to do this to you,

13:10.725 --> 13:12.358
Frankie, but, um...

13:12.393 --> 13:14.059
Look, uh, you know,

13:14.095 --> 13:16.128
well, Chili Reuben
was found dead,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.464
and this was the last place
that he gave a bad review.

13:18.499 --> 13:20.899
We know this is difficult for you,
but we have to ask you

13:20.935 --> 13:22.635
a few questions.
Just a couple questions, that's all.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.903
You're not saying
that I killed him?

13:24.939 --> 13:27.239
I feed you for
the last ten years

13:27.274 --> 13:29.475
every day, and this
is how you treat me.

13:29.510 --> 13:31.577
BOOTH: I mean, look, hey,
I'd be upset, too.

13:31.612 --> 13:33.948
I'd be really angry
if somebody trashed my work.

13:33.972 --> 13:35.048
In his video,

13:35.049 --> 13:38.550
Chili called your burgers
"bland and unmemorable."

13:38.586 --> 13:40.119
I think they're good.
Chili trashed

13:40.154 --> 13:42.688
my food because I refused
to pay him three grand

13:42.723 --> 13:44.857
for a good review.
I'm not paying blood money

13:44.892 --> 13:47.126
to some TV blowhard.
He tried to extort you?

13:47.161 --> 13:48.427
Was there any witnesses?

13:48.462 --> 13:50.229
Well, the only one back here
in the kitchen

13:50.264 --> 13:52.297
is my dishwasher, Glen.

13:53.005 --> 13:56.440
Excuse me.
FBI Special Agent...

13:56.475 --> 13:59.309
Booth. Sir,
can you put that down, please?

13:59.345 --> 14:00.610
Sorry about that.

14:00.646 --> 14:02.746
You wouldn't happen
to have overheard

14:02.781 --> 14:05.816
Chili try to squeeze some money
from my friend Frankie here?

14:05.851 --> 14:08.352
I don't pay much attention to anything
that's not my job.

14:08.387 --> 14:10.520
Okay.
Frankie won't let me.

14:10.556 --> 14:12.422
GLEN: Right, Frankie?
Mm-hmm.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.491
You should really

14:14.526 --> 14:16.531
drop it and leave me alone.

14:16.555 --> 14:17.795
You know I can't do that.
That's like

14:17.796 --> 14:20.030
you dropping your fries and
putting them back on the plate.

14:20.065 --> 14:22.466
Man, I got to talk to you--
it's my job, Frankie.

14:24.636 --> 14:26.970
Dr. Hodgins, have you found
anything that might tell us

14:27.005 --> 14:29.473
what Chili was up to the
night he was murdered?

14:29.508 --> 14:31.174
You mean other
than gorging himself?

14:31.210 --> 14:33.710
Because so far all I have
are fried potatoes, canola oil,

14:33.746 --> 14:35.579
beef, ketchup...
Well, I found  evidence

14:35.614 --> 14:37.681
of alcohol and marijuana
in his blood,

14:37.716 --> 14:39.436
so clearly,
food wasn't his only indulgence.

14:39.451 --> 14:40.851
There is
one other thing

14:40.886 --> 14:42.819
that I found--
I am pretty sure

14:42.855 --> 14:45.122
that he had hyperhidrosis.
Ooh.

14:45.157 --> 14:47.124
Excessive perspiration-- he just
gets more and more appealing,

14:47.159 --> 14:49.192
doesn't he?
Don't turn your nose up at sweat.

14:49.228 --> 14:50.594
Our armpits
have a story to tell.

14:50.629 --> 14:52.095
EDISON:
Yeah, from what I read

14:52.131 --> 14:53.864
of the victim's file,
I'm guessing that is no fairy tale.

14:53.899 --> 14:55.766
Clark! What are you
doing here?

14:55.801 --> 14:59.369
Well, I saw this in the paper, and
then Cam called.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.505
Look, if Frankie
<i>is</i> Chili's killer,

15:01.540 --> 15:03.573
then that means JoAnne
and the other waitresses

15:03.609 --> 15:04.908
will probably lose their jobs.

15:04.943 --> 15:06.743
Yeah, and we may lose
our favorite lunch spot.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.278
SAROYAN:
Not that our history

15:08.313 --> 15:09.713
with the diner
will affect our ability

15:09.748 --> 15:11.648
to remain impartial.
But if another set of eyes

15:11.683 --> 15:14.684
could help... You are a good,
kind woman, Camille Saroyan.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.853
Just doing my job.

15:16.889 --> 15:18.388
Speaking of which,
shouldn't you be

15:18.424 --> 15:20.657
in the bone room, Dr. Edison?
Yes, of course,

15:20.692 --> 15:22.826
but there is something
that I want to show you first,

15:22.861 --> 15:24.728
so...

15:30.135 --> 15:31.835
Okay, I lied.

15:31.870 --> 15:33.770
I have nothing
to show you.

15:33.806 --> 15:35.739
I'm confused.
Okay, normally,

15:35.774 --> 15:37.441
I wouldn't put myself
in the middle

15:37.476 --> 15:39.009
of these kind of things, and...

15:39.044 --> 15:41.044
they have the potential to, uh,
get a little awkward, so...

15:41.079 --> 15:44.114
Do you mind cutting
to the chase, Dr. Edison?

15:44.149 --> 15:46.650
It's Arastoo.
Arastoo?

15:46.685 --> 15:50.053
You heard from him? From Iran?
Yes. He e-mailed me.

15:50.088 --> 15:52.189
It's not weird,
because we're friends.

15:52.224 --> 15:54.324
Is something wrong? Is he okay?
Nothing's wrong.

15:54.359 --> 15:55.525
That's the point.

15:55.561 --> 15:57.260
He just wanted me
to reassure you

15:57.296 --> 15:58.395
that everything's fine.

15:58.430 --> 15:59.663
Is there a reason why

15:59.698 --> 16:01.331
he didn't tell me
this himself?

16:01.366 --> 16:03.500
He said he did tell you,

16:03.535 --> 16:04.801
more than once,

16:04.837 --> 16:06.770
but you didn't seem
to believe him.

16:06.805 --> 16:08.505
Well, because
going back to Iran

16:08.540 --> 16:10.807
could get him arrested.
Yeah, but he hasn't been.

16:10.843 --> 16:12.776
He's been with his brother--
that's the only reason

16:12.811 --> 16:13.811
he hasn't written more.

16:13.812 --> 16:14.911
He said Hamid

16:14.947 --> 16:17.013
isn't doing very well.
No.

16:17.049 --> 16:18.615
But Arastoo

16:18.650 --> 16:21.117
is fine, Dr. Saroyan.

16:21.153 --> 16:24.454
And me worrying just
makes it harder for him--

16:24.490 --> 16:26.089
I get it.
No, I...

16:26.124 --> 16:28.158
I didn't say that.
No,

16:28.193 --> 16:29.860
not in an obvious way.

16:29.895 --> 16:31.695
And for that...

16:31.730 --> 16:33.230
well, thank you.

16:33.265 --> 16:35.098
(phone chimes)
Oh. (clears throat)

16:35.133 --> 16:38.201
Okay. Oh, techs have
combed the dump site

16:38.237 --> 16:39.903
three times so far,

16:39.938 --> 16:41.872
and no sign of
the chili pepper earring.

16:41.907 --> 16:43.139
(sighs) Well, maybe...

16:43.175 --> 16:44.808
maybe Chili was
a sloppy drunk,

16:44.843 --> 16:47.477
and someone took advantage
of him and stole it from him.

16:47.513 --> 16:48.812
Well, if those
rubies are real,

16:48.847 --> 16:50.313
that could be
a pretty valuable earring.

16:50.349 --> 16:51.648
Yeah, wouldn't be
the first time

16:51.683 --> 16:53.116
that a robbery
went wrong.

16:53.151 --> 16:54.484
I pulled Chili's financials.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.620
Turns out he was flat broke.
Wait a second,

16:56.655 --> 16:59.289
how does the star
of a hit TV show end up broke?

16:59.324 --> 17:00.604
Well, according
to these records,

17:00.626 --> 17:01.992
a series of foolish investments,

17:02.027 --> 17:03.226
bad overspending,

17:03.262 --> 17:05.060
sports cars,
houses in Aspen,

17:05.097 --> 17:06.796
Nantucket, Miami.

17:06.832 --> 17:09.566
Plus, the man did like his bling.
Someone else did, too.

17:09.601 --> 17:11.667
We found his earring
at a local pawnshop.

17:11.703 --> 17:13.236
Someone came in
and pawned his earring

17:13.271 --> 17:14.704
two hours
before Chili was killed.

17:14.740 --> 17:17.440
We get an I.D. on him?
Got a receipt.

17:17.476 --> 17:19.776
(beeping)
Lists him as Brian Terrio.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.944
MONTENEGRO:
Sorry to interrupt, but...

17:21.980 --> 17:24.114
I'm enhancing
the pawnshop security footage,

17:24.148 --> 17:26.282
and I think I have a match.
Looks like

17:26.318 --> 17:27.191
the name's a fake.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.215
BOOTH: So Brian Terrio
is really Kenneth Morton.

17:29.922 --> 17:31.421
Why does that name
sound familiar?

17:31.456 --> 17:33.490
Because he worked
on Chili's TV show.

17:33.525 --> 17:36.660
Morton was the sound guy,
<i>and</i> he's got a record.

17:38.263 --> 17:39.963
Wow, look
at the rap sheet, huh?

17:39.998 --> 17:42.699
Breaking and entering, petty theft.
Crew's still

17:42.734 --> 17:44.067
at the hotel.
All right, sounds good.

17:44.102 --> 17:45.936
Thanks, Angela.
You got it.

17:45.971 --> 17:48.038
Take a look at this, Dr. Edison.

17:48.073 --> 17:50.273
Fractures on the victim's
left temporal and parietal bones

17:50.309 --> 17:52.642
that appear to have been
caused by blunt force trauma

17:52.678 --> 17:54.711
from a single
point of impact.

17:54.746 --> 17:56.880
Well, they must be
from something big.

17:56.915 --> 17:59.382
The fractures extend all the way
from the coronal suture,

17:59.418 --> 18:02.786
maxillary and zygomatic process.
By measuring them,

18:02.821 --> 18:04.287
you might be able
to determine

18:04.323 --> 18:06.923
the size and shape of
the object that struck

18:06.959 --> 18:09.125
Chili's skull.

18:09.161 --> 18:11.428
(exhales)

18:11.463 --> 18:13.597
Dr. Brennan, I'm confused
about these notes.

18:13.632 --> 18:16.299
I wasn't aware that we found
injuries to the frontal,

18:16.335 --> 18:18.301
nasal, vomer
or nasal conchae.

18:18.337 --> 18:20.070
Oh, those aren't
for this case.

18:20.105 --> 18:22.505
Those are lyrics to a song
I'm writing for Christine

18:22.541 --> 18:24.140
about the human
skeletal system.

18:24.176 --> 18:25.742
Oh, that's very nice.

18:25.777 --> 18:28.645
Well, if I was to write a song
about all the fractures

18:28.680 --> 18:31.247
I found on these ribs,
it might take an entire opera.

18:31.283 --> 18:35.385
They appear to run
along a diagonal line

18:35.420 --> 18:39.255
across the sternal ribs,
from three...

18:39.291 --> 18:42.025
all the way down to rib
eight on the left side.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.694
Well, Chili clearly got whacked
there with something, too.

18:44.730 --> 18:47.697
BRENNAN: Judging from the curvature
of the indentations,

18:47.733 --> 18:51.534
the weapon must have had
a cylindrical shape,

18:51.570 --> 18:55.238
like... a golf club or pool cue.

18:55.273 --> 18:57.240
Or maybe...

19:00.545 --> 19:03.546
...something like this.

19:03.582 --> 19:05.849
The sound man's
boom pole.

19:07.285 --> 19:09.319
AUBREY:
<i>So...</i>

19:09.354 --> 19:10.820
two days ago
your boss gets murdered,

19:10.856 --> 19:12.689
today we pick you up
at the bus station,

19:12.724 --> 19:15.659
two grand in your pocket,
about to skip town.

19:15.694 --> 19:17.861
I was going to Philadelphia
to visit my mother

19:17.896 --> 19:19.396
in the hospital.
You do realize that

19:19.431 --> 19:21.264
we have footage of you

19:21.299 --> 19:23.667
pawning Chili's earring
using a fake name.

19:23.702 --> 19:25.201
I only did that

19:25.237 --> 19:27.237
because he told me to.

19:27.272 --> 19:29.272
Okay. Did Chili tell you to...

19:29.307 --> 19:31.975
whack him in the ribs
using your boom pole, too?

19:32.010 --> 19:33.943
(chuckles):
No, no,

19:33.979 --> 19:35.078
it wasn't like that.

19:35.113 --> 19:36.846
Chili and I were
at some bar,

19:36.882 --> 19:40.617
and he wanted to...
"take the party up a notch."

19:40.652 --> 19:42.419
So he gave me
his earring and...

19:42.454 --> 19:44.585
told me to pawn it
and buy him some crank.

19:44.609 --> 19:46.123
Oh.

19:46.124 --> 19:48.491
And you thought,
what a good idea!

19:48.527 --> 19:50.760
He was my boss,
so yeah.

19:50.796 --> 19:52.429
I couldn't find any.

19:52.464 --> 19:55.465
I texted Chili, told him,
but he never texted me back.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.668
So you kept the money.
(laughs): Yeah. And kept my mouth shut.

19:58.704 --> 20:00.870
It wouldn't have looked
too good after he died.

20:00.906 --> 20:02.972
Yeah, no, you're right.

20:03.008 --> 20:04.908
And it still doesn't.

20:05.877 --> 20:07.877
(exhales)

20:09.867 --> 20:12.620
Hey. You, uh, located
the Spicemobile?

20:12.621 --> 20:14.387
Huh? No, no,
not yet. Why?

20:14.423 --> 20:17.223
Oh. Well, you couldn't wait
to see me, so I figured you were

20:17.259 --> 20:18.825
knee-deep
in particulates.

20:18.860 --> 20:22.462
Uh, no, but we are
knee-deep in Benjamins.

20:22.497 --> 20:24.798
I just got the paper
back from the lawyer,

20:24.833 --> 20:26.366
and now they are
projecting that

20:26.401 --> 20:28.468
we're going to sell
40 million units

20:28.503 --> 20:30.203
the first year alone,

20:30.238 --> 20:33.540
and they just gave
me a $2 million advance. (laughs)

20:33.575 --> 20:34.941
What?!

20:34.976 --> 20:36.743
(quietly): Oh, my God.
Yeah.

20:36.778 --> 20:40.079
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

20:40.115 --> 20:41.581
Is this really happening?

20:41.616 --> 20:43.950
(laughing): Yes.
And I don't know why

20:43.985 --> 20:47.187
I'm so excited, because
it's not like I've never been rich before.

20:47.222 --> 20:48.755
Well, yeah,
but that was

20:48.790 --> 20:51.024
family money-- this is
the first time you're rich

20:51.059 --> 20:54.194
because of something you did, alone.
Yeah. Yeah.

20:54.229 --> 20:55.829
The hard thing now,
though, is, like...

20:55.864 --> 20:59.032
I mean, I just, I got to
figure out how to tell Cam.

20:59.067 --> 21:01.935
SAROYAN:
Tell Cam what?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.503
Uh...

21:03.538 --> 21:05.438
AUBREY: <i> I just heard back</i>
<i>from the hospital</i>

21:05.474 --> 21:07.340
in Philly-- Morton's
story checks out.

21:07.375 --> 21:10.477
So the mother really is sick?
Yep. He's telling the truth.

21:10.512 --> 21:13.313
Maybe. Let's see if the
bartender confirms seeing Chili

21:13.348 --> 21:15.081
at the bar with Morton.

21:15.116 --> 21:18.485
You have no trust;
I like it, though.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.687
Yup. That's the jerk
who gave me the black eye.

21:20.722 --> 21:21.921
Wait a second,

21:21.957 --> 21:23.456
you and Chili fought?
About 20 minutes

21:23.492 --> 21:24.757
after his friend left.

21:24.793 --> 21:26.493
I mean, that Chili guy
was hammered.

21:26.528 --> 21:28.161
AUBREY: You do realize
that according

21:28.196 --> 21:30.363
to Chili's colleague,
your bar was the last place

21:30.398 --> 21:32.899
Chili was seen alive?
Hey, look, I don't know nothing

21:32.934 --> 21:34.901
about no murder.
Last time I seen that fool,

21:34.936 --> 21:36.646
I was kicking his ass out
the door, just like I do

21:36.647 --> 21:37.871
all the obnoxious drunks.

21:37.895 --> 21:40.241
So in other words, you...
you let a customer

21:40.242 --> 21:43.243
who was completely intoxicated
get behind the wheel of a car?

21:43.278 --> 21:45.278
I took his keys--
that's when the fight started.

21:45.313 --> 21:47.046
That's how I ended up with this.
Right.

21:47.082 --> 21:49.482
You guys were fighting outside.
You know what I'm thinking,

21:49.518 --> 21:51.784
I'm thinking maybe they're
getting into this big brawl

21:51.820 --> 21:54.754
outside, things escalate, this guy,
you know, thinks he's above it all,

21:54.789 --> 21:56.189
because he's famous, right?

21:56.224 --> 21:58.258
You get angry,
you hit him more than once,

21:58.293 --> 22:00.460
and, well...
I was trying to help the dude.

22:00.495 --> 22:03.530
He decked me-- that's when he took
his keys back and he drove off.

22:03.565 --> 22:05.932
Any idea where he went?
No clue.

22:05.967 --> 22:09.102
At that point,
I was just happy to see him go.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.740
You remember
the honeycomb-structured

22:13.775 --> 22:16.075
ultra rubber covering
that I was working on?

22:17.479 --> 22:18.945
Um, I sold it.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.281
Oh, c-congratulations.
For...

22:21.316 --> 22:24.183
$2 million.
That is just the advance.

22:25.287 --> 22:27.654
Sorry.
So, I just wanted

22:27.689 --> 22:29.265
to make sure, you know, that
there were no hard feelings...

22:29.289 --> 22:30.591
Wait, wait, wait.

22:30.592 --> 22:32.759
If I had let you test that
in the lab,

22:32.794 --> 22:35.295
most of that money would've gone
to the Jeffersonian?

22:35.330 --> 22:38.565
Uh, legally, yes.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.300
Oh, my God.

22:40.335 --> 22:41.701
You're-you're pissed.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.537
Why? I followed every rule,

22:44.573 --> 22:46.406
every protocol, and for once

22:46.441 --> 22:47.840
I'm not
the bad guy.

22:47.876 --> 22:50.143
Wait, you're happy about this?

22:50.178 --> 22:53.112
Are you kidding?
I-I couldn't be happier.

22:53.148 --> 22:55.648
Two of my best, most dedicated
colleagues won the lottery,

22:55.684 --> 22:59.852
and it's all because of some
bloated bureaucratic rule book?

22:59.888 --> 23:02.755
(laughing):
Th-This is j... this is...

23:02.791 --> 23:05.658
It's wonderful!

23:05.694 --> 23:07.327
Gee.

23:07.362 --> 23:08.628
I wish we could go out
and celebrate,

23:08.663 --> 23:10.530
you guys paying, of course,

23:10.565 --> 23:13.266
but we-we've got a case.

23:13.301 --> 23:15.635
Right.
And I got the results

23:15.670 --> 23:17.837
from the test
on his hair follicles.

23:17.872 --> 23:20.206
It turns out Chili did have
a crank habit,

23:20.241 --> 23:22.286
but there's no evidence
he used the day he was murdered.

23:22.310 --> 23:23.877
Well, if Chili

23:23.878 --> 23:26.012
wanted crank and Morton didn't
get it for him,

23:26.047 --> 23:28.915
then maybe he just went
and got it for himself.

23:30.385 --> 23:33.186
I found abrasions
on Chili's right metacarpals

23:33.221 --> 23:37.256
and second, third,
and fourth proximal phalanges.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.659
That would be consistent with the
bartender's description of the fight.

23:39.694 --> 23:42.695
Yes. But I would prefer
that we find evidence

23:42.731 --> 23:44.297
that points
to something we don't know.

23:44.332 --> 23:47.767
We will.
We are quite a team, Clark.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.370
Yes. We are.

23:51.439 --> 23:53.006
You know, it-it just always

23:53.041 --> 23:55.742
kind of weirds me out
when you refer to me

23:55.777 --> 23:57.210
by my first name.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.380
Temperance.

24:00.415 --> 24:03.149
Hmm. I thought you couldn't
bring yourself to use mine.

24:03.184 --> 24:03.873
Yeah, I gave it a shot.

24:03.897 --> 24:05.897
I got to tell you,
it hurt a little bit, but...

24:06.755 --> 24:09.789
it made it easier for me,
to, um,

24:09.824 --> 24:11.591
give you this.

24:11.626 --> 24:13.559
I couldn't get the idea
of your song out of my head,

24:13.595 --> 24:15.628
so I jotted down
a few words for you.

24:15.664 --> 24:18.064
"From the incus to the coccyx,
the stapes

24:18.099 --> 24:20.633
"to the talus, you better
watch your ethmoid and vomer

24:20.669 --> 24:23.069
when you're driving top down
in Dallas."

24:23.104 --> 24:24.971
Hmm, very clever.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.673
Well, thank you.

24:26.708 --> 24:28.741
You know... you know,
if you have any more ideas

24:28.777 --> 24:31.210
that you want
for your song, you know, um,

24:31.246 --> 24:33.780
we're quite the team,

24:33.815 --> 24:36.182
I've been told.
I would welcome your help.

24:36.217 --> 24:38.785
Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:38.820 --> 24:41.621
Hey. Take a look

24:41.656 --> 24:44.457
at this
hairline fracture

24:44.492 --> 24:48.027
on the margin of the glenoid
fossa of the right scapula.

24:48.063 --> 24:49.295
It seems to...

24:49.330 --> 24:50.730
extend all the way down

24:50.765 --> 24:53.966
to the olecranon fossa
of the ulna.

24:54.002 --> 24:55.935
From the amount of remodeling,
these injuries

24:55.970 --> 24:58.237
are at least
three weeks old.

24:58.273 --> 25:01.674
So it seems that Chili had been
in more than one fight recently.

25:01.710 --> 25:05.878
Because he didn't
behave decently.

25:05.914 --> 25:08.948
He plays the nice guy
facetiously.

25:08.983 --> 25:10.516
Get it. Get it,
Dr. Brennan. Get...

25:10.552 --> 25:12.185
Perhaps one song
at a time.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.087
Yeah. Of course.

25:14.122 --> 25:15.621
Dr. Ed...
Dr. Edison,

25:15.657 --> 25:17.790
uh, can I have a word with you?

25:17.826 --> 25:20.326
Oh. Yes, Dr. Saroyan.

25:22.363 --> 25:24.097
"Hungry, sleep-deprived,
and in need of a shower.

25:24.132 --> 25:27.633
But otherwise, all is well.
Miss you. Love, Arastoo."

25:27.669 --> 25:30.269
So, this e-mail worries you why?

25:30.305 --> 25:33.806
Wh-What if he's been arrested
and this is some kind of code?

25:33.842 --> 25:35.608
Starvation and sleep deprivation
are very common forms

25:35.643 --> 25:37.910
of torture.
Oh, okay. But so is being

25:37.946 --> 25:40.379
hungry and tired because
you're in the hospital all day

25:40.415 --> 25:42.281
with your dying brother.
B-But I've tried

25:42.317 --> 25:43.850
to call him for the last two
hours and he's not picking up.

25:43.885 --> 25:45.184
Yeah, okay.
That's because

25:45.220 --> 25:47.353
it's the middle
of the night there.

25:47.388 --> 25:50.823
You think I'm making too much
of this, don't you?

25:50.859 --> 25:52.158
No, those are
your words,

25:52.193 --> 25:53.193
not mine.

25:53.228 --> 25:54.560
I j...
(sighs)

25:54.596 --> 25:57.597
I was fine. I really was.
(stammers)

25:57.632 --> 26:00.299
And then all of a sudden
this wave of worry comes over me

26:00.335 --> 26:02.602
and I am just... I am convinced
that something horrible

26:02.637 --> 26:05.171
has happened to him. I can't stop it.
Okay.

26:05.206 --> 26:07.140
Okay, look, it's understandable.

26:07.175 --> 26:08.674
You're so used
to controlling things,

26:08.710 --> 26:09.990
and you just can't in this case.

26:10.011 --> 26:12.812
So now I'm a control freak?
What?

26:12.847 --> 26:14.447
No. No, no. I'm not...
(stammers) First of all,

26:14.482 --> 26:16.115
I didn't say "freak."
No, no...

26:16.151 --> 26:19.218
We're-we're good.
Thank you. We're done.

26:19.254 --> 26:21.754
(sighs)

26:24.592 --> 26:28.161
You know, this isn't my fault,
Dr. Saroyan.

26:28.196 --> 26:30.463
Look, if
I could,

26:30.498 --> 26:32.932
I would take
all your worry away.

26:32.967 --> 26:35.501
I just can't.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.071
I'm sorry. I...

26:39.107 --> 26:42.842
I guess
I'm-I'm...

26:42.877 --> 26:48.014
just... looking for a reason
why all this is happening.

26:48.049 --> 26:50.483
Something that...

26:50.518 --> 26:52.351
(sighs)

26:52.387 --> 26:56.255
something that would satisfy
a control freak.

26:56.291 --> 26:58.925
But...

26:58.960 --> 27:02.995
if you'll just be honest with me
if you hear anything...

27:03.031 --> 27:05.531
Dr. Saroyan...

27:06.467 --> 27:08.668
...I'm a very bad liar.

27:08.703 --> 27:11.571
(chuckles) I think that's
why Arastoo

27:11.606 --> 27:13.706
chose me to reassure you.

27:13.741 --> 27:17.710
I just wish
I had done a better job.

27:24.719 --> 27:27.520
(sniffles)

27:27.555 --> 27:29.422
Wow, this neighborhood
is horrible, isn't it?

27:29.457 --> 27:31.591
Uh, yeah.
So why the smile, Doc?

27:31.626 --> 27:33.426
In the field.
Gives me a rush.

27:33.461 --> 27:36.162
It's like I'm taking
my life into my own hands.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.930
Well, I'm not sure you're taking
your life in your hands.

27:37.966 --> 27:40.566
I mean, I'm armed,
there are cops here.

27:40.602 --> 27:42.602
Just saying, I'm not
intimidated. Booth knows that.

27:42.637 --> 27:45.538
Which is why he said, "You take
him, Aubrey. I'll stay here."

27:45.573 --> 27:48.507
Exactly. Oh, there it is.
Thanks. Might have missed it.

27:48.543 --> 27:52.278
Wow. I can't believe

27:52.313 --> 27:56.515
that I am actually seeing
the Spicemobile in person.

27:57.852 --> 28:00.152
(flies buzzing)

28:00.188 --> 28:02.989
Oh. And smelling it.

28:03.024 --> 28:05.591
Yeah, this place
is ripe.

28:05.627 --> 28:07.393
It's pretty disappointing
to find out

28:07.428 --> 28:10.196
your hero's a total slob.
Eh, I disagree.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.999
There are no particulates
as good as slob particulates.

28:13.034 --> 28:15.735
At least he added
a navigation system.

28:15.770 --> 28:18.638
If Angela can tell us where
Chili drove over the past week,

28:18.673 --> 28:20.640
it might lead us
to his killer.

28:20.675 --> 28:22.909
Oh, wow. This slob makes pigs
look dainty.

28:22.944 --> 28:24.343
All right, you know what,
we're just gonna take

28:24.379 --> 28:26.879
the entire van
back to the lab.

28:30.184 --> 28:33.753
I'll bet
this was delicious once.

28:33.788 --> 28:36.722
Aubrey, please don't eat that.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.891
(sniffs)

28:42.631 --> 28:44.547
BOOTH:
Bones. Hey.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.116
Booth, what are you doing here?
Well, I was doing some digging

28:47.151 --> 28:49.118
into, uh, Chili Reuben's
shoulder injury,

28:49.153 --> 28:51.053
and it turns out he was
in Memphis in the emergency room

28:51.088 --> 28:52.755
three weeks ago.
Memphis?

28:52.790 --> 28:55.591
Yeah, he was there, um, shooting
some episodes of the show.

28:55.626 --> 28:58.327
That's very interesting. But
you could've just told me this

28:58.362 --> 29:01.063
on the phone.
I got you this.

29:01.098 --> 29:02.598
Booth.

29:04.335 --> 29:06.502
Oh, it's beautiful.

29:06.537 --> 29:07.970
Like it?

29:08.005 --> 29:10.205
Love it.
Yeah. Let me help you...

29:10.241 --> 29:11.974
put it on.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.643
Here you go. Thanks.

29:14.678 --> 29:16.239
Okay.

29:16.264 --> 29:18.181
Kind of resembles a
humerus bone, right?

29:18.182 --> 29:20.916
Well, if you curved it,
I suppose.

29:20.951 --> 29:22.451
How does it look?

29:25.322 --> 29:26.622
Like I made the right choice.

29:26.657 --> 29:29.925
It is quite exquisite.
I was...

29:29.960 --> 29:31.093
talking about you.

29:31.128 --> 29:32.261
I made
the right choice.

29:32.296 --> 29:34.763
I'm just so lucky

29:34.799 --> 29:36.799
to have you as my wife.

29:36.834 --> 29:40.803
I have something for you, too.
For me?

29:40.838 --> 29:43.439
Well, what are you doing
with my gambling sobriety chip?

29:43.474 --> 29:45.274
I found it in the laundry.

29:45.309 --> 29:47.009
I must have left it
in my pocket.

29:47.044 --> 29:48.110
It's not like you, Booth.

29:48.145 --> 29:49.278
You always know
where your chip is.

29:49.313 --> 29:51.113
Well, you know what,

29:51.148 --> 29:53.849
I know where it is now
because of you.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.858
Did you find anything useful
in Chili's navigation system?

30:02.893 --> 30:05.260
Yes. I hacked into its history
and pulled up all the maps

30:05.296 --> 30:08.831
of where Chili traveled
during this past week in D.C.

30:08.866 --> 30:13.135
It turns out on four of the six
days Chili was in town, he left

30:13.170 --> 30:14.603
the diners he was reviewing

30:14.638 --> 30:17.639
to drive
to more respectable restaurants.

30:17.675 --> 30:19.608
And he did the same thing
in other cities.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.743
Sounds like the King
of the Greasy Spoon

30:21.779 --> 30:23.145
didn't practice
what he preached.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.447
And I downloaded his calendar
from the cloud.

30:25.483 --> 30:28.317
These are the people
he ate with.

30:28.352 --> 30:30.385
Who are they?

30:30.421 --> 30:32.788
Reality TV show producers.

30:32.823 --> 30:34.289
I thought
he already had a producer.

30:34.325 --> 30:36.925
Looks like he wanted
to get rid of him.

30:36.961 --> 30:39.461
PRODUCER:
<i>Why would I kill him?</i>

30:39.497 --> 30:42.531
Without Chili, I
don't have a show.

30:42.566 --> 30:44.833
Chili was firing you
from the show

30:44.869 --> 30:47.002
that you two created together.

30:47.037 --> 30:51.006
Okay? Logic goes out the window
when you're in a rage, Sid.

30:54.645 --> 30:58.146
I-I had no idea
that that disloyal bastard

30:58.182 --> 31:00.782
was planning to replace me.
I think you found out

31:00.818 --> 31:03.418
what Chili was up to
when you were down in Memphis.

31:03.454 --> 31:05.621
Hmm? You two fought,
you sent him to the E.R.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.964
Then three weeks later,
you decided to finish him off.

31:07.988 --> 31:09.259
Chili went to the hospital

31:09.260 --> 31:11.827
in Memphis because he jumped out
of a moving car

31:11.862 --> 31:14.329
when I tried
to take him to rehab.

31:14.365 --> 31:16.598
Rehab?
Yeah. I mean, this guy,

31:16.634 --> 31:18.200
he was seriously screwed up.

31:18.235 --> 31:19.835
Between the-the drinking

31:19.870 --> 31:21.570
and-and the drugs and
all the one-night stands,

31:21.605 --> 31:23.705
do you know how many
waitresses I had to pay off

31:23.741 --> 31:25.274
so they wouldn't leak
their stories to the tabloids?

31:25.309 --> 31:26.708
So what are you
still doing

31:26.744 --> 31:28.744
in town then, Sid?
I mean, if Chili's gone,

31:28.779 --> 31:30.612
there's no more show, is there?

31:30.648 --> 31:32.614
Well, the network is, uh...
is forcing me

31:32.650 --> 31:34.316
to finish the episode
without him.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.818
Uh, they expect the ratings
to go through the roof

31:36.854 --> 31:38.921
now that he's dead.
Oh, that's interesting.

31:38.956 --> 31:40.622
So you get fired from the show

31:40.658 --> 31:43.225
and your career's
in the toilet, but if you end

31:43.260 --> 31:45.627
on a ratings high note,
then you're

31:45.663 --> 31:48.931
hot property,
right?

31:50.367 --> 31:53.368
There's evidence of blood
on the floor back here,

31:53.404 --> 31:55.837
and it looks like someone tried
to clean it up.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.213
Well, it could belong to
Chili or to his killer.

31:58.237 --> 31:59.809
Wow.

31:59.810 --> 32:01.209
It isn't gonna be easy
to find evidence

32:01.245 --> 32:02.544
of a struggle in this mess.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.079
I cannot believe
that anyone

32:04.114 --> 32:05.914
would treat
such a fantastic vehicle

32:05.950 --> 32:09.051
like a rolling Roman food orgy.
Uh,

32:09.086 --> 32:11.653
that orgy may not have been
exclusively for food.

32:11.689 --> 32:13.722
We have body fluids.

32:13.757 --> 32:14.957
Ew. Well,

32:14.992 --> 32:17.059
if the van's a-rockin'...
Yep.

32:17.094 --> 32:18.894
And judging from the amount
of hydration,

32:18.929 --> 32:21.897
they're fairly recent.
Do you smell something?

32:21.932 --> 32:24.566
Yeah, I'm trying not to.
I don't know. It's something floral.

32:24.602 --> 32:28.370
But that could be a good thing
for us. Yeah.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.372
If I can actually get
an air sample and run it

32:30.407 --> 32:32.341
through the gas chromatograph,
I should be able to isolate

32:32.376 --> 32:35.477
the smell and reformulate it chemically.
Okay.

32:35.512 --> 32:38.614
While you do that, I'm gonna see
what I can get from the fluids.

32:38.649 --> 32:42.985
Sounds good.
Smell you later.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.114
Dr. Brennan,
I've already examined the skull.

32:45.138 --> 32:46.289
Yes, but based

32:46.290 --> 32:48.056
on the defensive wounds
we found earlier,

32:48.092 --> 32:49.591
I decided to take
another look,

32:49.627 --> 32:52.427
and I found something
very interesting.

32:52.463 --> 32:54.863
EDISON: There's a crescent-shaped bruise
on the occipital.

32:54.898 --> 32:55.653
How did we miss this?

32:55.677 --> 32:57.677
Well, it's likely
we didn't notice it before

32:58.102 --> 33:02.704
because it was hidden
under Chili's hair plug scars.

33:02.740 --> 33:05.273
I'd like to take another look
at the X-rays of our skull.

33:05.309 --> 33:06.575
You seem agitated,
Dr. Edison.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.110
Well, no, "frustrated"
is more accurate.

33:08.145 --> 33:10.979
We've only used 187 bones
in the song so far,

33:11.015 --> 33:13.315
and I'm having second thoughts
about rhyming

33:13.350 --> 33:14.983
"calcaneus" with "malleus."
It's...

33:15.019 --> 33:16.485
Anxiety is

33:16.520 --> 33:18.320
a perfectly normal
physiological response

33:18.355 --> 33:20.155
to the vulnerability that comes

33:20.190 --> 33:21.857
with engaging in a
creative endeavor.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.892
Oh, that's good to know.

33:23.927 --> 33:26.261
Look. I knew I saw something.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.696
There's a tiny missing fragment
on the occipital.

33:27.731 --> 33:29.264
Something must have
hit him there.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.966
Though the force of the
hit doesn't appear to be

33:31.001 --> 33:32.934
strong enough to kill him.
Yes, but still, if we found

33:32.970 --> 33:34.703
the implement
that was used to make this,

33:34.738 --> 33:36.204
it could lead us to our killer.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.709
HODGINS: So I isolated all the aromas
that weren't food-based

33:40.744 --> 33:42.678
into their own
individual compounds,

33:42.713 --> 33:45.547
which I then reformulated
into a condensed,

33:45.582 --> 33:47.215
more intensified
version.

33:47.251 --> 33:49.117
SAROYAN: Look, before you turn
on the Smell-O-Vision,

33:49.153 --> 33:50.619
Dr. Hodgins,
I just want

33:50.654 --> 33:53.055
to thank you both
for being here today.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.123
Uh... it's kind of our job.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.591
I realize that,

33:56.627 --> 33:58.760
but anyone else who got
a check for $2 million

33:58.796 --> 34:00.829
probably would have
taken the day off.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.097
Oh.

34:02.132 --> 34:03.732
Yeah, I guess that's true. I...

34:03.767 --> 34:05.233
I didn't even think about that.

34:05.269 --> 34:07.536
SAROYAN: Which is why I
said thank you.

34:07.571 --> 34:09.771
I hope I haven't
given you any ideas.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.440
No.
No. No, no.

34:12.476 --> 34:15.210
Look, first of all, we know
how quickly it can disappear,

34:15.245 --> 34:17.713
and we love our jobs, so...
sniffers ready.

34:17.748 --> 34:20.348
All right, so far,
I have identified

34:20.384 --> 34:23.018
benzaldehyde,
ethyl acetate, sage...

34:23.053 --> 34:24.886
This is gonna
be tough, but...

34:24.922 --> 34:26.455
SAROYAN:
It's perfume.

34:26.489 --> 34:29.123
I'd recognize
that perfume anywhere.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.225
It's JoAnne.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.993
Uh, who's JoAnne?

34:32.029 --> 34:34.096
JoAnne's the waitress
at the Royal Diner.

34:34.130 --> 34:36.864
She never mentioned that her
and Chili got personal.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.699
In the back of
the Spicemobile, no less.

34:38.735 --> 34:40.969
Based on the injuries
to the side of Chili's head,

34:41.004 --> 34:43.271
I'm not so sure that
that encounter was consensual.

34:46.944 --> 34:48.710
JoANNE:
<i>There was no assault.</i>

34:48.746 --> 34:51.612
Chili and I hooked up
in the back of his Spicemobile.

34:51.648 --> 34:53.648
Consensually.

34:53.684 --> 34:56.351
I'm not proud of it, but last
I checked, it's not a crime.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.754
No, but lying to the FBI is.
I didn't want Frankie

34:58.789 --> 35:01.056
to know that I slept
with the guy who was about

35:01.091 --> 35:02.524
to trash our diner
on national TV.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.359
Hey, look, maybe you
just got angry at Chili

35:04.394 --> 35:06.228
because he used you for sex,
so you...

35:06.263 --> 35:07.896
you took something off
the spice rack, you smashed him

35:07.931 --> 35:09.465
in the face, next thing
you know, he's dead.

35:09.489 --> 35:10.633
No.

35:10.634 --> 35:12.434
The only way I could have
injured him

35:12.469 --> 35:13.735
was with a partial disruption

35:13.771 --> 35:16.171
of his posterior
sacroiliac complex.

35:16.206 --> 35:18.173
If you know what I'm saying.

35:18.208 --> 35:20.375
Why is she talking like you?

35:20.410 --> 35:22.444
It means an injury caused
by excessive movement

35:22.479 --> 35:23.779
of the pelvis
during sex.

35:24.681 --> 35:25.914
Nicely described, JoAnne.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.349
Thank you.

35:27.384 --> 35:29.050
Look, I mean...
just one of those things.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.419
It was a...
quickie in the back of a van.

35:31.455 --> 35:33.421
It was nice to feel
like a kid again.

35:33.457 --> 35:34.756
And what happened after that?
Nothing.

35:34.792 --> 35:36.191
He took off in the van.
That's the last

35:36.226 --> 35:37.826
I've seen of him.
Look, you know what?

35:37.861 --> 35:39.594
If we're done here,
I need to go back to work.

35:39.630 --> 35:42.164
I do make most
of my living on tips.

35:42.199 --> 35:43.598
Oh, hold on.
I got a tip for you.

35:43.634 --> 35:44.699
I wouldn't think
about leaving town.

35:44.735 --> 35:46.015
I may have to talk to you again.

35:46.036 --> 35:49.304
You can forget
about your free refills.

35:50.574 --> 35:52.307
What?

35:55.260 --> 35:58.896
And the trapezoid, radius,
scapula, lunate, hamate ♪

35:58.897 --> 36:02.666
♪ The bones in the arm,
they run the full gamut... ♪

36:02.701 --> 36:03.867
Very nice, Dr. Brennan.

36:03.902 --> 36:05.435
I had no idea
you were so talented.

36:05.471 --> 36:06.970
Oh. Yes.

36:07.006 --> 36:09.039
Sometimes I surprise myself.

36:09.074 --> 36:10.574
Right.

36:10.609 --> 36:11.842
Well, I got the test results

36:11.877 --> 36:13.777
from the blood
in the back of the van.

36:13.812 --> 36:16.446
It isn't JoAnne's,
and it isn't Chili's, either.

36:16.482 --> 36:19.316
Well, it could still belong
to the killer.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.551
Not unless Chili was murdered
by a double cheeseburger.

36:21.587 --> 36:23.220
Turns out it's beef blood.

36:23.255 --> 36:26.390
Oh. I was hoping
for more of a clue.

36:26.425 --> 36:28.025
We all were.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.094
Dr. Brennan, can I
ask you a question?

36:31.130 --> 36:33.096
Oh. If I can sing

36:33.132 --> 36:35.999
while inspecting the bones,
I can certainly converse.

36:37.536 --> 36:40.370
Do you think...
do you think Arastoo

36:40.406 --> 36:42.539
didn't ask me to go
to Iran with him

36:42.574 --> 36:44.041
because I've been
so noncommittal

36:44.076 --> 36:45.509
about the whole marriage thing?

36:45.544 --> 36:47.110
I imagine everyone

36:47.146 --> 36:49.379
is telling you
that he'll be fine over there.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.647
Yeah, but I...

36:50.682 --> 36:52.149
I can't stop worrying.
Of course not.

36:52.184 --> 36:54.985
The truth is, Arastoo
could be arrested in Iran

36:55.020 --> 36:56.486
or even executed.

36:56.522 --> 36:58.221
If you were with him,

36:58.257 --> 36:59.723
you would have been
in danger, too.

36:59.758 --> 37:00.991
He knew that.

37:01.026 --> 37:02.692
Wow.

37:02.728 --> 37:04.828
Thanks for...

37:04.863 --> 37:06.763
not holding back.

37:06.799 --> 37:09.900
Arastoo loves you, Cam.

37:09.935 --> 37:12.402
Whether or not you marry him.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.005
That's why he didn't
want you to...

37:15.040 --> 37:16.773
go with him.

37:16.809 --> 37:19.976
I would have done
the same thing.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.980
So would I.

37:24.016 --> 37:27.050
Then you should
feel better.

37:28.787 --> 37:31.154
I do. Yes.

37:31.190 --> 37:33.390
Thank you.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.863
Dr. Brennan
asked me to take

37:39.898 --> 37:41.698
another look at the
X-rays of the skull.

37:41.733 --> 37:43.800
I think I might have
found something.

37:43.836 --> 37:46.069
Now, it's pretty small,
but there appears to be

37:46.105 --> 37:49.239
evidence of hemorrhagic staining
on the tympanomastoid.

37:49.274 --> 37:50.841
Maybe you could swab it.
Yeah.

37:50.876 --> 37:52.242
It's the ear canal, right?
Well, technically,

37:52.277 --> 37:53.610
it's the bone
surrounding it.

37:53.645 --> 37:55.278
But you know
what the strange thing is?

37:55.314 --> 37:57.781
Chili showed no sign
of cerebrovascular trauma.

37:57.816 --> 37:59.116
Without that,

37:59.151 --> 38:00.517
hemorrhagic staining
to the tympanomastoid

38:00.552 --> 38:02.085
could only mean one thing.

38:02.121 --> 38:04.321
Chili drowned.

38:04.356 --> 38:06.723
That would explain why
we missed it before.

38:06.758 --> 38:08.859
Forensically, drowning has
no diagnostic features.

38:08.894 --> 38:11.962
And Chili's lung tissue was
too damaged by the corrosives

38:11.997 --> 38:13.663
to show evidence
of excessive fluid.

38:13.699 --> 38:15.365
Plus...

38:15.400 --> 38:17.667
this crescent-shaped
bruise to the occipital

38:17.703 --> 38:20.137
is the same size and
shape of a sink faucet.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.139
If Chili was killed
at the diner,

38:22.174 --> 38:24.207
then the particulates
and missing fragment

38:24.243 --> 38:26.209
may still be
in the drain catch.

38:26.245 --> 38:27.911
Oh, yeah.

38:29.114 --> 38:30.947
So, according
to Chili's injuries,

38:30.983 --> 38:33.683
the killer pushed him
against the edge of the sink,

38:33.719 --> 38:35.886
causing the line of fractures
along the lower ribs.

38:35.921 --> 38:37.420
EDISON:
Then, when Chili tried

38:37.456 --> 38:39.890
to raise his head to gasp
for air, he banged his head

38:39.925 --> 38:41.491
on the faucet,
bruising his occipital.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.493
If that graphic is accurate,

38:43.529 --> 38:45.428
the faucet at the diner
looks too small

38:45.464 --> 38:47.364
to have left that mark
on his head.

38:47.399 --> 38:48.598
Yeah, you're right.

38:48.634 --> 38:50.066
HODGINS:
Well, I reexamined

38:50.102 --> 38:52.435
Chili's lung tissue,
and I found evidence

38:52.471 --> 38:54.471
of glycerin, sodium sulfate,

38:54.506 --> 38:55.772
hydrolyzed vegetable protein...

38:55.807 --> 38:57.574
Aren't those
ingredients common

38:57.609 --> 39:00.277
in the types of drain cleaner
used to decompose the body?

39:00.312 --> 39:02.078
HODGINS: That's what I assumed,
until I discovered

39:02.114 --> 39:04.214
the presence of aloe Vera
and coconut oil.

39:04.249 --> 39:05.715
Wait, that sounds
more like soap.

39:05.751 --> 39:07.217
Yeah.
It does.

39:07.252 --> 39:09.553
Which would explain the
foreign epithelial cells

39:09.588 --> 39:11.621
I found that weren't
a match for Chili's.

39:11.657 --> 39:14.324
Pull up the Web site of
the motel Chili was staying at.

39:14.359 --> 39:16.693
There's got to be
pictures of the rooms.

39:16.728 --> 39:19.596
MONTENEGRO: Okay, here, let's take
a look at the bathtub.

39:19.631 --> 39:22.032
EDISON: Now, without exact measurements,
it's hard to be certain,

39:22.067 --> 39:23.700
but the bruise
on Chili's skull

39:23.735 --> 39:26.403
seems to be a match
to that faucet.

39:26.438 --> 39:29.706
And I'm guessing his rib
fractures line up, too.

39:29.741 --> 39:31.741
MONTENEGRO: Sure looks like it.
HODGINS: Wait a minute.

39:31.777 --> 39:33.710
But I thought the FBI
combed through Chili's room

39:33.745 --> 39:35.245
and found no evidence
of foul play.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.081
But the entire crew
was staying at that motel.

39:38.116 --> 39:40.884
Chili could have been killed
in someone else's room.

39:44.056 --> 39:45.622
BOOTH: So, what was it,
Kenneth? I mean,

39:45.657 --> 39:46.856
you couldn't watch
Chili destroy his body

39:46.892 --> 39:47.991
with all the drinking,

39:48.026 --> 39:49.793
the smoking and
the junk food?

39:49.828 --> 39:51.962
What Chili did with his personal
life was none of my business.

39:51.997 --> 39:54.030
Except that it was because--
you know why? Your mother is in

39:54.066 --> 39:55.498
the hospital right now
dying of kidney failure.

39:55.534 --> 39:57.434
BRENNAN: Records show
that she spent

39:57.469 --> 39:58.702
two years on the transplant list

39:58.737 --> 40:00.103
waiting for a kidney
that never showed up.

40:00.138 --> 40:01.671
BOOTH: What, and Chili
just walks in

40:01.707 --> 40:03.506
and gets two organ transplants

40:03.542 --> 40:04.874
and he still
abuses himself?

40:04.910 --> 40:06.543
It was like him giving
your mother the finger.

40:06.578 --> 40:07.978
BRENNAN:
We found a fragment

40:08.013 --> 40:10.814
of Chili's skull
inside your bathtub drain.

40:10.849 --> 40:14.384
And we found your epithelial
cells inside Chili's lungs.

40:16.421 --> 40:18.855
We know you did it, man.

40:25.030 --> 40:27.497
I didn't mean to kill him.

40:27.532 --> 40:29.332
I swear.

40:29.368 --> 40:30.867
He shows up drunk.

40:30.902 --> 40:32.569
I'm in the bath.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.771
He's screaming
about how I couldn't score

40:34.806 --> 40:35.972
any crank for him.

40:36.008 --> 40:37.140
And then he
starts ransacking

40:37.175 --> 40:38.908
my bathroom, looking for pills.

40:38.944 --> 40:41.878
The guy was so drunk,
he slips on the wet floor

40:41.913 --> 40:43.446
and hits his head on the toilet.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.914
That would explain the trauma

40:44.950 --> 40:46.416
to the temporal
and parietal bones.

40:46.451 --> 40:48.051
Yeah, but that only
made him crazier.

40:48.086 --> 40:50.520
Then he starts swinging at me.

40:50.555 --> 40:53.189
I... I-I couldn't
take it anymore.

40:53.225 --> 40:55.125
I held him underwater
to shut him up.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.328
Then you just dumped the body
and went to go see your mom.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.565
Yeah.

41:02.601 --> 41:05.068
I didn't know
what else to do.

BOOTH:
<i>Wow, this place is packed.</i>

41:27.392 --> 41:30.360
BRENNAN: <i>Probably because of all</i>
<i>the publicity from our case.</i>

41:30.395 --> 41:31.861
There's Frankie
right over there.

41:31.897 --> 41:34.331
Hey, my three
favorite customers.

41:34.366 --> 41:36.266
I saved your
table for you.

41:36.301 --> 41:38.635
Look at that, huh? You sure
you're not still mad at us?

41:38.670 --> 41:39.936
Are you kidding me?

41:39.971 --> 41:42.005
Business is better than ever.
Enjoy.

41:42.040 --> 41:42.490
Thanks.

41:42.514 --> 41:44.275
Can we sing Daddy the
song while we wait?

41:44.276 --> 41:45.342
Whoa.
What, here?

41:45.377 --> 41:46.876
Wait a second.
What song?

41:46.912 --> 41:48.945
"The Bone Song."
The real one. "The Bone Song"?

41:48.980 --> 41:51.381
Wait a second. You didn't
butcher the song, did you?
