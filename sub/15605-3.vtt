WEBVTT

00:09.720 --> 00:11.480
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:13.360 --> 00:15.440
'This time, it's all-stars.'

00:15.520 --> 00:19.040
'Old faces return for another shot
at finding love.'

00:19.120 --> 00:21.880
Am I looking for love? Fucking yeah.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.080
'They'll have to endure their exes.'

00:24.160 --> 00:26.840
I've never, ever felt
like this in my life.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.440
'Some will have to deal
with old grudges.'

00:30.680 --> 00:33.320
You've had more dicks
than I've had sunbeds.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.720
'As hard as they try to find
their perfect match...'

00:36.800 --> 00:38.840
Right. Who wants to finger me?

00:38.920 --> 00:43.320
'...standing in their way once again
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:43.400 --> 00:46.160
I won't lie.
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.920
'It's going to be hotter
than ever before.'

00:49.000 --> 00:52.120
I'm gonna ride her tonight.
Giddy up, Amy.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.560
'As emotions boil over.'

00:53.640 --> 00:55.280
You made me realise

00:55.360 --> 00:57.840
there's more to life
than what I was just doing.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.320
'Tensions run high.'

00:59.400 --> 01:00.760
(shouting)

01:00.840 --> 01:04.000
Let's fucking go, kid.
'And the claws come out.'

01:04.080 --> 01:07.920
(shouting)

01:08.000 --> 01:10.800
'So far, three exes have arrived.'

01:10.880 --> 01:12.440
'But whose...'

01:12.520 --> 01:15.320
She is the most toxic person
I've ever met.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.000
'Ex...

01:17.080 --> 01:18.920
...is...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.120
...next?'

01:20.200 --> 01:22.880
I did not think
I was gonna feel like this.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.680 --> 01:44.400
You tried to mug us off
in front of the whole world.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.600
Hawley is the love of my life.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.720
Wait till he finds out
that his mate Gaz has fucked his ex.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.400
The first night,
Jemma and him fucked.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.880
Does he think
he can get away with that?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.360
You two fucked each other.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.880
I fucked Gaz once. You fucking
shagged the whole of Newcastle!

02:00.960 --> 02:02.760
You shagged everybody.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.000
I do have one secret
I've gotta tell him.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.240
I did get with Scott.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.800
Fucking hell, man.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.680
I wanna be loved. Who do you fancy?
Me or Jordan?

02:11.760 --> 02:15.600
You called her a dogger.
You're a wanker. Get away from me.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.560
It's time to send someone home.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.280
Chloe, you gotta go, mate.
You're boring.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.880
What, cos you can't
get in my fucking fanny?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.600
Charlotte? Yes!

02:25.680 --> 02:29.200
Charlotte coming in as my ex,
I could not be happier.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.360
Gaz takes me to the penthouse.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.800
On the way,
we just bumped in to Liv.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.920
Last night was fucked up. I'd say
the best night I've ever had.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.200
I got to send Chloe home.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.320
Ding-dong, the witch is gone.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.240
Follow the yellow brick road,
fuck off!

03:00.640 --> 03:05.280
Now Chloe's gone, I want some more
fun and I want some pussy.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.560
I'm gonna pursue Charlotte tonight.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.320
Today, I woke up feeling drained.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.840
It's gonna be difficult for Hawley
to even see past what I've done.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.280
I still very much am
in love with Hawley.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.240
And I do want to sort things out.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.360
Hawley getting with someone here
isn't going to happen.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.880
That bitch will get fucked up.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.320
They're not gonna fuck
in front of me.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.560
My relationship with Jemma at the
moment is a head fuck.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.600
It's one rule for Jemma
and one rule for me.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.720
I need to come up with
some sort of plan of attack.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.480
I woke up this morning, it was like
a dream. Olivia and Charlotte there.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.400
I felt like a king.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.800
Oh, my God.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.720
I had a great night last night
nothing happened, just kisses.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.320
We kept it classy. Not trashy.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.960
There are a coupe of lads
that take my fancy.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.200
I obviously like Gaz.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.680
I would like to get to know
Bear a bit more

04:11.760 --> 04:14.480
cos he does tickle my pickle.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.000
Today, I've woken up
and I feel emotionally drained.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.680
There's such a clique in this villa.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.400
The boys just seem to bitch all the
time, I can't bounce off anyone.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.000
I'm not having fun at all.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.320
Since I've been here,
I've been a miserable bitch.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.320
I've been getting aggy
and I've just not felt myself.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.760
You're not going anywhere!
I am leaving.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.760
What the fuck? Jess is leaving, too?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.440
I just want to get home.

04:42.520 --> 04:47.000
I came in here hoping for love, but
all these guys want is a cheap shag.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.720
Bye. See ya.
I'm like, "Fucking get in!"

04:51.800 --> 04:53.240
Another one bites the dust.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.920
Is there nothing we can do?
No.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.320
I don't think
the villa's gonna change much

04:57.400 --> 05:00.240
cos she wasn't really getting
involved with the game.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.880
We're all gonna have
a belting night tonight.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.280
Play loads of games.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.640
You look fit, man.
How are you?

05:13.720 --> 05:15.840
Nice eyes, nice ears.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.360
We could have the first kiss.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.240
Boring. She hates me.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.960
I don't kiss people on first dates.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
She is a fun-sponge.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.920
(shouting)

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
If I can charm Megan McKenna,
I can surely charm Jess.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.160
Don't fucking push me!
Don't push me, then!

05:39.240 --> 05:40.920
You're pushing me!
Fuck off!

05:41.000 --> 05:42.760
Can you just fuck off?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.920
Where am I gonna go?
I'm in Thailand.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.760
(crying) Now I don't even
want to be here any more.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.400
And I'm drunk.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.400
'With Jess having left
to find some mature men,

06:01.480 --> 06:05.920
the Tablet of Terror has sent Olivia
and Gaz to play with a big trunk.'

06:07.400 --> 06:10.440
I'm scared.
He's so cute!

06:10.520 --> 06:13.160
There's just this massive elephant.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.480
He's massive.
Absolutely massive!

06:16.560 --> 06:20.040
This doesn't happen often, something
with a bigger trunk than me.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.080
'Yeah! Good one, Gaz.'

06:22.160 --> 06:24.080
Look how big its trunk is.

06:24.160 --> 06:28.520
Now he knows what it feels for girls
when they see his trunk.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.840
We need to walk under her trunk.
Go on, Gary.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.480
Underneath?

06:36.560 --> 06:40.080
Oh, my God. You go first.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.360
Ooh, you fucker.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.960
If one of the ears hits me, it would
be like getting hit by Tyson Fury.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.600
You can do it.
You wanna go?

06:47.680 --> 06:49.760
I'll go first.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.360
It's gonna get you!

06:52.440 --> 06:56.200
I'm trying a little bit of a flirt,
but every time this elephant moves,

06:56.280 --> 06:57.280
I shit myself.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.040
I can't do it. I'm so scared.
It's fine.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.240
Oh, my God.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.760
Gaz is absolutely shitting himself.
He's terrified.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.200
You're a little pussy.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.840
Gaz is fit, we really get along,
and he's got a massive dick.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.640
So, obviously I'm gonna
flirt with him.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.080
I think last night,
if Charlotte wasn't in the bed,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.160
I wouldn't have slept with you,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.960
but it would have been
a lot harder not to.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.000
Olivia's been amazing. I just bathed
an elephant in the jungle.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.360
What more do you want?

07:37.080 --> 07:40.560
'Olivia and Gaz may be getting on
like a house on fire for now,

07:40.640 --> 07:45.320
but who will get burned when the next
old flame lights up the beach?'

07:45.400 --> 07:47.720
(evil laugh)

07:53.480 --> 07:57.400
Fuck off, you Tablet of Terror.
You slimy see-you-next-Tuesday.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.960
I hate this bit.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.320
Hello, all-stars.
It's that time again.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.200
Can Bear, Hawley
and Kayleigh go to the beach?

08:06.280 --> 08:08.800
Tablet of Terror, you mug!

08:08.880 --> 08:10.560
(muffled scream)

08:10.640 --> 08:12.840
I know exactly what's gonna happen,

08:12.920 --> 08:16.240
it's either gonna be some Newcastle
slag with STI's.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.400
If any girl comes off that beach
claiming to be Hawley's ex,

08:19.480 --> 08:24.240
she's got another thing coming and
she's gonna know that I'm waiting.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.160
It's gonna be Bear's ex and Hawley's
gonna go on a date with her.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.160
That slag better watch out as well.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.840
Jemma instantly kicks off, but she
hasn't got a foot to stand on.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.320
I'm shitting myself.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.160
I hate coming down this beach.
I'm looking forward to it.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.160
Since I've been here,
I've had a shit time with Jemma.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.760
Hopefully what comes out of the
water is gonna make life better.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.160
For my ex to come out right now,
I think it's filth.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.560
I don't wanna see a fella
get with my birds.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.640
Or my ex-birds. It's not nice.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.840
There is one ex in particular
that will send me off my game.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.640
I'm not ready for that yet,
cos my game ain't really started.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.520
Bad ex equals bad Kayleigh.
Bad Kayleigh equals game over.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.760
I need a nervous poo, cos I dunno
what's gonna come out of the sea.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.920
And I'm shitting myself.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.240
I thought I'd feel nervous,
but I'm actually excited for...

09:27.320 --> 09:30.680
I know why you're excited.
Yeah, it's about time I got revenge.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.840
(laughs)

09:31.920 --> 09:34.560
I know Hawley wants revenge today.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.240
And I guarantee, if my bird comes
out today, he'll try to fuck her.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.400
Which would piss me right off.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.000
Do you reckon Jemma's gonna be happy
if you were to get with someone?

09:44.080 --> 09:47.160
Hopefully not, like.
What leg does she have to stand on?

09:47.240 --> 09:49.160
She doesn't have any
leg to stand on.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.600
It's time she got a taste
of her own medicine.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.320
I don't give a fuck what comes out,
if it's got a fanny, I'll fuck it.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.920
'Spoken like a true gent.'

10:27.320 --> 10:28.880
Oh, fucking hell, man.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.400
Thank fuck I saw Holly,
she means fuck all to me.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.640
Just a finger.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.920
You look nice.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.200
(hums a tune)

10:37.280 --> 10:39.880
You all right, stranger?

10:39.960 --> 10:43.200
My name's Holly. I'm coming back in
for my ex, Bear.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.520
Bear's a massive dickhead,
but he's a massive worldy.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.760
Everyone saw him
completely mug me off.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.240
When he got with Vicky.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.000
This year,
I'm the same bunny boiler,

10:54.080 --> 10:56.320
but no-one's gonna
make me look like a mug.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.760
I'm done with this convo.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.960
You're full of shit.

10:59.040 --> 11:04.320
I'm single. I'm horny. And this
beach better be full of sorts.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.440
(laughs) I'm blushing.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.560
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, how you doing?

11:11.640 --> 11:14.200
Fucking thank the lord.
This is Kayleigh.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.200
She knows who I am.
(Holly)I hate her already.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.680
I hate Kayleigh Morris.
I think she's a bully.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.680
(Bear) Why, what's happened?

11:25.320 --> 11:27.120
This is a fucking joke.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.760
I fucking hate her.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.600
What's your purpose for coming?

11:30.680 --> 11:34.280
Well, I'm single. And last year,
someone made me look like a mug.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.760
Yeah. Who?
Someone sat right next to me.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.160
Well, I've been made to
look a mug, so...

11:40.240 --> 11:42.760
Why? What happened?
Jemma Lucy.

11:42.840 --> 11:46.840
Oh, yeah. Is Jemma there?
Oh, I will have one friend then.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.200
I'm gonna be a little shit-stirrer.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.160
If Jemma's been slagging me off,
she can fuck right off.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.440
Is she joking?
She's meant to be a mate.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.400
I wouldn't trust her.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.240
OK. Well, I'll say something
to her when we get back.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.840
So, apparently,
Jemma doesn't like me any more.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.200
Hawley's a worldy.
See you later, Jemma. Hello, Hawley.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.920
Didn't you get finger-blasted
by him on the show?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.240
Babe, please don't try
and insinuate that I'm a slut.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.640
You've had more dicks
than I've had sunbeds.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.440
Her face irritates me.

12:18.520 --> 12:22.200
You're so irrelevant, I don't need
to argue with you right now.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.160
I've said...
Why are you so het up?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.280
You're shouting at me.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.320
Listen to yourself,
you're the one shouting.Shush.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.520
Who are you telling to shush?
You.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.920
Don't shush me.
I'll tell you where to go.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.080
Who the fuck are you
telling to shush?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.960
Don't fucking speak to me like that,
you little slag.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.920
Shush. Shush. Shush your mouth
before I pop your lip-filler.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.280
Say that to me
one more fucking time.Shush.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.000
Fucking, don't call me a slag!

12:48.080 --> 12:49.880
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

12:49.960 --> 12:51.640
These girls are fucking mental.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.800
(shouting)

12:53.880 --> 12:56.080
Fucking hell, I'm getting excited.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.480
Don't come at me, I'll fuck you up!

12:58.560 --> 12:59.800
Fuck off, you slag!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.440
Don't get up in my face, babe.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.040
I think she just ripped my eyelash.
You look beautiful, shush.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.400
Skinny, scrawny, lanky little twat.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.840
Holly does not realise she's walking
in to that villa with a big problem.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.560
Oh, no.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.240
Tablet of Terror, you're a penis.
A shrivelled penis.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.920
"Welcome to the beach."

13:21.000 --> 13:23.240
"It's date time for you and Hawley

13:23.320 --> 13:27.520
with a local Thai apple."

13:27.600 --> 13:30.880
No, "tipple".

13:30.960 --> 13:34.480
I'm buzzing to go on a date with
a massive worldy and get drunk.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.560
You're gonna get drunk tonight, man.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.320
Go on a date with Holly,
more than likely get lucky.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.240
And fuck over Jemma.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.840
Hello.
Hello.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.080
Me and Holly turn up
to this crazy little shack,

13:51.160 --> 13:53.000
loads of radge bottles of potions.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.040
Hard dick?
Hard dick?

13:59.720 --> 14:00.880
Have some of that one.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.160
It's fucking definitely
ready to play.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.400
One, two, three.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.440
OK. You can enjoy.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.560
I quite liked the hard dick, if I'm
honest, I just hated the bee one.

14:15.640 --> 14:19.160
Basically, I think we should mix
them all together, put them in this

14:19.240 --> 14:20.920
and then we can name it.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.560
Good shout. So, what's this?
Whiskey?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.040
Yeah.
What was the name?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.040
Strong dick.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.040
Oh, I think that's strong dick.
I remember that one.

14:30.560 --> 14:35.080
'It's time for Bear and Kayleigh to
break the news of the new arrival.'

14:35.160 --> 14:37.320
Oh, my God.
Here we go.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.520
I see Bear
and my heart starts racing.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.120
What didn't happen
at the beach today?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.240
Holly's arrived.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.720
There's gonna be shit
going off in this villa.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.640
It turns out, Kayleigh hates Holly.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.800
They're both going at each other.
Insults, insults.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.960
Next thing I know,
they've got each other by the hair.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.880
Like, literally...

14:56.960 --> 15:00.760
She went for me, so I had her by the
hair. In two seconds I went, boom.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.760
I've never met this Holly,
but she's obviously a skanky slag.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.880
What happened?

15:05.960 --> 15:09.320
Hawley was a bit flirty with Holly,
giving her compliments.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.760
And they've gone on a date.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.920
He's on a date with Bear's ex,
Holly. Like, what the fuck?

15:15.000 --> 15:19.280
What would you do if they kissed?
She'll get her hair pulled again.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.400
I know that Hawley wants revenge
and Holly's a fucking easy bitch.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.280
At the end of the day, if they get
together, I'll make her life hell.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.960
Hawley's on a rampage at the minute.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.360
He wants to bang. Only cos you two
got together. He's angry.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.920
He wants to prove a point.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.400
Bear is doing what Bear does. He
stirs shit up and makes it worse.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.280
But it is actually quite funny.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.240
All he's thinking was revenge.

15:43.320 --> 15:47.200
(Jemma) I'll just get my revenge back
again. I'm sick of this game.

15:47.280 --> 15:52.080
I'm going downstairs to make myself
look better than fucking Holly.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.560
I wanna know everything.
What's happened?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.880
I came here as Jemma's ex,
and then I found out she banged Gaz.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.400
Then I sat down on a date
with her yesterday,

16:01.480 --> 16:05.040
"By the way, your best mate, Scotty
T, I shagged him New Year's Eve."

16:05.120 --> 16:07.760
No! Gemma sounds like
she's been a fucking bitch.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.200
I would like to get revenge,
but it's like,

16:10.280 --> 16:12.360
me stooping down to her level.
Yeah.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.240
If I get with someone it's gonna be
cos I genuinely like them.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.640
Hawley sounds like he's had
a hard time, I feel sorry for him.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.120
I think you're the only lass
that I've been attracted to

16:23.200 --> 16:26.960
cos everyone else has been a bitch.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.840
Oh, what? So you only fancy me cos
everyone else has fucked you off?

16:30.920 --> 16:34.920
I'd definitely get back with Jemma,
but let's see what happens.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.360
Am I gonna get grief off Jemma
for being on date with you now?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.040
You probably will, aye.

16:41.120 --> 16:46.160
Well, she can fuck off, cos...
I'm having a good time, so fuck her.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.920
I couldn't give a flying fuck
what happens back at the villa.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.520
I'm gonna try and piss her off more.
Cheers to everyone being twats.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.400
Twats, aye.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.800
That's the fourth time
I spilt this down me.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.280
Want me to lick it off?
Yeah, go on.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.480
Go on, Hawley, down you go.
Lick it up.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.200
Hopefully it's not the last time
I'm down there.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.800
I reckon our Whiskey
should be called Neck On.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.680
Sounds good to me. Cheers.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.000
I think this guy's
got something in mind.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.680
'Back at the villa, it seems Bear
is also keen to get necking on.'

17:29.760 --> 17:32.400
'Maybe he's been
on the hard dick, too.'

17:32.480 --> 17:35.400
The problem is, Char,
I haven't really spoken to you.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.960
We haven't, have we?
Not had a one-to-one.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.440
Swoopy time.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.040
I done the radar.
Charlotte, babe, come on.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.800
I need to talk to you.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.480
Do you fancy me the most
out of all the boys?

17:48.560 --> 17:52.960
Yeah. I think so, yeah.
Do you wanna hear a secret?

17:53.040 --> 17:56.600
Go on.
I fancy you, too.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.760
First night was hectic
for Charlotte.

17:58.840 --> 18:02.280
Didn't know where she was. Easy.
Let's kiss Gaz.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.360
She fancies me the most.
Do you know why?

18:05.440 --> 18:08.400
Gaz is ugly and he's boring.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.280
I'm the fucking G.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.440
Can we have at least one baby?

18:12.520 --> 18:15.880
Oh, yeah. Two.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.280
I think our babies
would be fucking great.

18:18.360 --> 18:22.040
We were both staring in to each
other's eyes, smizing our heads off.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.520
And I just want to kiss him.
I want to kiss his fucking face off.

18:26.600 --> 18:31.640
I wanna absolutely eat it like
it's a Victoria sponge or something.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.760
(laughs)

18:32.840 --> 18:34.440
To us.
To us.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.200
Charlotte and Bear. Chair.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
(laughs)

18:39.360 --> 18:42.600
Tonight's the night when Bear
gets a bit of attention.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.720
Never rush the pudding.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.720
Let it set and bake.
Then you leave it.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.560
Then you go back there,
but I'm not gonna rush this cookie.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.960
'Waiting too long could be
a recipe for disaster,

18:55.040 --> 18:58.120
with exes pouring in
hungrier than ever.'

18:58.200 --> 19:03.080
'Whose ex is next?'

19:06.400 --> 19:09.280
Who had the best craic
on today's date?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.720
(cheering)

19:13.800 --> 19:16.360
We're trying to take
Jemma's minds off the date.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.040
Play games, have a laugh.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.520
Do you want
another finger blast tonight?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.120
(laughter)

19:23.200 --> 19:26.120
'Don't you know the rules
of Mr and Mrs, Charlotte?'

19:26.200 --> 19:28.960
My plan for tonight
is chill with Gary again.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.480
He's the only guy I feel
natural sexual chemistry with.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.240
We're having a good time,
letting our hair down.

19:35.320 --> 19:40.040
Who do you think's better in bed?

19:40.120 --> 19:45.920
Back of my mind I'm thinking
how my ex and a girl I know

19:46.000 --> 19:48.880
are on a date together.
I can't deal with it.

19:52.400 --> 19:57.880
'Well, that's one way
of dealing with it, Jemma.'

19:57.960 --> 19:59.200
Really?

19:59.280 --> 20:01.640
Why the fuck is it going off now?

20:01.720 --> 20:05.640
"Hello, everyone. Greetings from
the date between Holly and Hawley."

20:05.720 --> 20:07.800
"Drink it all in."

20:07.880 --> 20:09.880
Oh, nah, it's pictures.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.720
Fuck me.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.080
Wow.

20:17.560 --> 20:22.240
They've been on one date and
Hawley's got his face in her vagina.

20:22.320 --> 20:25.680
Wow.
Oh, my fucking God!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.360
Jem, don't look.

20:28.440 --> 20:32.280
I haven't seen them yet. Can you
imagine what I'll do if I see them?

20:32.360 --> 20:34.120
I'll end up off that balcony.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.120
What the fuck's going on?

20:36.200 --> 20:39.400
Oh, my fucking God!

20:39.480 --> 20:43.400
The pictures are minging. Why would
you go there when you've got Jem?

20:43.480 --> 20:47.120
You got them tits in your face,
why would you want her shit tits?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.880
Are you fucking having a laugh?

20:48.960 --> 20:50.200
Ssh, ssh.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.600
You're not looking.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.080
We were having such a good night.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.320
Has he been shagging her?
No.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.600
They're not shagging,
they're kissing.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.800
His head's between her legs.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.560
His face is in her pussy, yeah.
Are you mad?!

21:07.440 --> 21:10.480
Right. Show me these
fucking pictures now!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.720
You wanna play fucking games, yeah?
I'll play a game harder.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.800
That tablet's gonna get smashed up.
Give it to me, Gaz.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.640
I'll show you.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.800
Fucking hate it.
I'm telling you now.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.600
I will smash it. This isn't funny.
This is real.

21:23.680 --> 21:28.040
I wanna smash it. I don't get angry,
but someone's winding me up!

21:29.720 --> 21:33.640
I'll make a video of me sucking
someone's dick and send it to him.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.120
In fact, I'll tie him up
so he can watch me do it.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.520
He will never have this again.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.120
She fucked you, she snogged Jordan.
What's her problem?

21:42.200 --> 21:46.320
Hold on a minute, Jem.
You fucked Gaz!

21:46.400 --> 21:48.880
Just shut up!

21:48.960 --> 21:51.320
I'm telling you,
I'm not fucking having it!

21:51.400 --> 21:54.040
They're snogging. They're snogging.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.320
The prick that is Hawley
is trying to get revenge

21:57.400 --> 22:01.120
with some sket who looks
like a fucking 12-year-old.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.520
Right. Who wants to finger me?

22:03.600 --> 22:06.200
I am loving this!

22:06.280 --> 22:09.040
I don't want to be in here.
Calm down.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.560
I can't deal with it.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.960
(muffled)

22:15.280 --> 22:17.640
(muffled)

22:17.720 --> 22:21.480
They're not together. I don't know
why she's reacted like that.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.480
It's ridiculous.
Jemma's fucking one of us tomorrow.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.080
I would smash her.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.640
Obviously licking a fucking shot
or something off her leg.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.040
He wants to lick her minge.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.680
'With one fight on the beach
under her belt,

22:39.760 --> 22:42.920
it might be time for Holly
to put her gloves back on.'

22:43.000 --> 22:44.360
'Ding-ding!'

22:46.320 --> 22:49.040
(cheering)

22:49.120 --> 22:50.320
Any good?

22:50.400 --> 22:54.840
Aye. Decent, aye.
Made some Thai whiskey.

22:54.920 --> 22:59.400
Hawley and Holly walk in,
smiling, chuffed with themselves.

22:59.480 --> 23:03.800
They have no idea that I've just
seen pictures on that tablet.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.320
Holly, you can't look me in the eye.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.880
Well, I heard you've been
slagging me off, Jemma. So...

23:09.960 --> 23:13.840
Straight away, Jemma's on me
like a fly on shit.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.080
I heard you called me a slag.
Really?

23:16.160 --> 23:19.000
Before this, how did the date go?

23:19.080 --> 23:23.360
(Hawley) We had like whiskey and...
Is that it?

23:23.440 --> 23:24.800
We did lots, babes.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.840
Are you actually ready? Because
your hair's gonna be everywhere.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.640
I've seen it babe,
I've got pictures.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.360
The Tablet's fucked us over.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.680
I don't care, I just told you.
So why you coming in the villa...

23:36.760 --> 23:40.240
Cos you've been slagging me off!
What the fuck have I done?!

23:40.320 --> 23:43.800
(shouting)

23:43.880 --> 23:47.840
Jemma! Jemma! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:47.920 --> 23:52.520
I haven't ever done anything wrong.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.040
(mimics Holly)

23:54.120 --> 23:55.800
You fat cunt!

23:55.880 --> 23:59.040
Every single night, someone's
hair's getting ripped out.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.680
It's fucking crazy.

24:00.760 --> 24:06.080
How can she even go on like that?
She's been necking on with Jordan.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.840
She's a fucking little slut.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.040
All I've had since I've been here
is aggro from you.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.080
I went out and enjoyed myself
and you're kicking off.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.000
She's the one
who's getting walloped off everyone.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.400
I think you've got issues.
You've got issues, you prick.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.960
Good shot.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.120
Oh, what? Cos you can duck well?
Next time you won't able to.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.320
Jemma's kicking off. (mimics Jemma)

24:27.400 --> 24:30.440
Tits everywhere.
Fucking Jemma, shut up, man.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.920
Do you fancy Holly?
Do you want to bang her?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.760
She's a good-looking lass, aye.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.120
His type is big boobs and tattoos.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.200
She's got double As, yeah?

24:40.280 --> 24:44.880
No tattoos,
extensions that fall on the floor.

24:44.960 --> 24:48.760
My hair's real, babe. Have you
pulled this? My hair's real.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.480
Do you want to bang her?
What's it gotta do with you?

24:51.560 --> 24:55.120
Cos I'm asking you a question.
Are you gonna bang her?

24:55.200 --> 24:57.480
Are you gonna bang her
while I'm here?

24:57.560 --> 24:58.800
Fuck knows.

24:58.880 --> 25:03.080
Fuck knows? Well, you can know cos
I'm gonna fucking bang someone.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.320
We're in an environment
where I cannot escape.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.920
I'm not going anywhere! No-one's
taking me fucking anywhere!

25:15.160 --> 25:19.480
What have I done?
Nothing, you've gone on a date.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.080
Boring. You're irrelevant.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.720
What did you just say?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.160
'Uh-oh, it's round three.'

25:34.240 --> 25:38.640
I wasn't calling you boring.
You mean nothing to me.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.400
You look like a skank,
that's all I'm saying.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.400
Babe, I've just come back...

25:44.480 --> 25:46.920
It's not mine,
it's Kayleigh's, so...

25:50.240 --> 25:51.280
You're a skank.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.880
Someone get this bitch
out of my face.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.640
I wasn't even speaking to you.
I heard what you said!

25:57.720 --> 26:02.400
(shouting)

26:07.200 --> 26:09.840
What the fuck have I walked in to?

26:09.920 --> 26:14.520
Oh, my God.
Get the fuck away from me!

26:14.600 --> 26:17.680
You slag!
You're irrelevant to my life.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.480
You're a mess.
You look like a goblin.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.000
I've come in for five minutes,
why's everyone shouting at me?

26:32.320 --> 26:35.120
Everyone's arguing
and do you know what I do?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.120
I strike when the iron's hot.

26:37.200 --> 26:40.320
And it was roasting.
It was fucking red hot.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.200
I wanna fork her...

26:43.280 --> 26:44.440
...all night.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.400
I reckon we could have Bear cubs.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.960
(indistinct whispering)

26:49.040 --> 26:51.680
Little bear cubs.
I want Chaz cubs.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.240
We are just so the same, it's weird.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.480
She was on Bear's Tours,
but she didn't know.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.320
It's called Secret Bear's Tours.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.960
Gaz is gonna show me
the parsnip again.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.360
I have never seen
anything quite like it.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.520
It needs its own postcode.

27:28.520 --> 27:32.080
Stop it!

27:32.160 --> 27:35.000
Hand started slipping
and she's like, "Not tonight."

27:37.760 --> 27:38.880
Fuck.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.320
I think he's gonna be good in bed.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.760
Mad. There's no handle on the door.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.280
Today, I'm in a good mood.
I'm happy.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.040
Cos last night, everyone
was kicking off in the villa.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.520
So I took Charlotte downstairs
and I thought, right, here we go,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.040
bit of action.
We kissed, I touched her nunny,

28:25.120 --> 28:27.520
just on the cloth,
didn't want to be creepy,

28:27.600 --> 28:30.360
squeezed her bum and chatted
a lot of shit in her ear,

28:30.440 --> 28:32.440
but you know what? She enjoyed it.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.160
I spent the night
with Olivia last night.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.600
I just don't want to fuck her yet.
I promise you I will,

28:42.680 --> 28:47.680
but you hear that sound? That's the
beach. It's exes. I can't do it yet.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.760
Stop making me wet, Gaz.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.520
This morning I woke up
in the penthouse with Hawley.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.320
Obviously we had a kiss
and a little cuddle.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.840
Nothing else happened,

28:59.920 --> 29:03.120
cos I am not a slut and I don't fuck
on the first date.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.960
Glad she didn't put out.
It means she's not a slag.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.640
Put a bit of graft, so we'll see
what happens from here on out.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.120
Last night was probably one of the
worst nights I've ever had

29:18.200 --> 29:20.400
because Hawley got with somebody.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.880
One minute I just fucking hate him,
the next minute I fucking love him.

29:29.200 --> 29:34.800
He's my ex. I still think of him as
my boyfriend and he's with Holly.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
I'm really struggling.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.360
Yo!

29:44.440 --> 29:45.680
Morning.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.280
Everyone is thinking,
have they? Haven't they?

29:50.360 --> 29:53.880
Did youse bang? You didn't?

29:53.960 --> 29:56.440
Cheeky finger?

29:56.520 --> 29:59.960
You can cut the tension
with a fucking spoon.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.120
Any kissing?

30:03.200 --> 30:06.120
Just a kiss and a cuddle, yeah?
Aye. Just chill.

30:06.200 --> 30:10.200
The fact they didn't shag
makes me feel a bit relieved,

30:10.280 --> 30:12.920
but it doesn't mean
it's not gonna happen tonight.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.080
Holly, do you fancy Hawley?
Yeah, he's a worldy.

30:18.800 --> 30:23.000
Do you think he's a sort?
Bear, stop it!

30:23.080 --> 30:24.760
It's just a joke in my eyes.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.280
One rule for you
and different for us?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.920
You took a girl to the shag pad,
I'm pissed off.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.160
What does Hawley do?
Opens his mouth.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.800
You shagged his mate,
what do you expect?

30:35.880 --> 30:38.320
What did you say, Holly?
Are you gonna pipe up?

30:38.400 --> 30:41.800
Holly got her fucking mouth moving
and her annoying voice.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.320
As if I'm not gonna bite.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.520
I'm just saying what I think.
Shut the fuck up.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.040
It's nothing to do with you.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.440
Can't be bothered to argue.
Just let me eat my cornflakes.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.960
Shut up then.
What you piping up for?

30:54.040 --> 30:55.720
Just saying what I think, hun.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.520
'With all the agg in the air,

31:01.600 --> 31:06.560
the tablet has sent Bear and
Charlotte on a date to learn Thai.'

31:06.640 --> 31:08.720
'Chok di, guys.'

31:08.800 --> 31:10.160
(speaks in Thai)

31:10.240 --> 31:12.560
(mimics him)

31:12.640 --> 31:13.800
That's, "My name."

31:13.880 --> 31:17.560
I meet this fella,
turns out his name's Pong.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.200
Hopefully he can teach me
a ping or two.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.320
How do you say,
"Hello" first? Hello.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
(speaks Thai)

31:23.480 --> 31:25.040
(mimics)

31:25.120 --> 31:28.280
That's right!

31:28.360 --> 31:30.320
(mimics Bear) That turns me on.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.120
Bear's not very clever,
I'm not very clever.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.440
We're like two dumbos
sat there like, huh?

31:37.520 --> 31:40.400
You're gonna pretend
to be me, ready?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.040
Charlotte.
Charlotte.

31:42.120 --> 31:48.040
Do you think this is a sexual date?
(repeats in Thai)

31:48.120 --> 31:49.200
(laughs)

31:49.280 --> 31:51.400
I weren't good
with languages in school.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.760
The only language I knew was,
"Get in the girls' knickers! Oi-oi!"

31:55.840 --> 31:58.480
Oh, yeah!

32:00.360 --> 32:02.080
Yes. OK! (laughs)

32:04.280 --> 32:08.440
Oh, lovely. (laughs)
That's very nice.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.080
I wanna get her knickers off.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.880
How do you say, in Thai,
"I want to lick your nunny."

32:12.960 --> 32:14.880
What's nunny?
The furry cup.

32:14.960 --> 32:18.720
For Thai, it's (translates).

32:18.800 --> 32:21.280
How do you say,
I want to lick your (repeats).

32:21.360 --> 32:26.800
(translates)
(repeats)

32:29.280 --> 32:31.520
Yes!
Muy bien.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.680
That's right!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.760
(all chant in Thai)

32:36.600 --> 32:39.920
'With Pong helping Bear
to work his magic,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.240
Chair could become a real ping.'

32:42.320 --> 32:44.720
Do you know what Charlotte?
I really like you.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.200
And I wrote you a poem.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.560
Oh, my God. I can't cope.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.360
"I'm glad you're here with me."

32:50.440 --> 32:53.040
"Your eyes sparkle
like the Thailand sea."

32:53.120 --> 32:54.680
He's so cute.

32:54.760 --> 32:58.200
"Me and you, we're having fun."

32:58.280 --> 33:00.440
"I'd like to do you up the bum."

33:00.520 --> 33:03.560
(laughs) What a belter.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.720
That was so romantic.

33:09.800 --> 33:15.040
Would I let Bear do me up the bum?
We'll see what happens tonight.

33:15.120 --> 33:19.920
I just want to say, you're the best
wingman I've ever had in my life.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.600
I love Pong. I could go down the pub
and have a beer with him.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.720
Chat a few birds up.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.120
Thank you.
Thank you.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.320
'You might be feeling cheery now,

33:30.400 --> 33:34.120
but you'll be feeling the pain
when the next ex arrives.'

33:34.200 --> 33:36.880
'T-minus 30 minutes.'

33:36.960 --> 33:40.840
(evil laugh)

33:44.000 --> 33:46.680
'With Holly and Jemma
avoiding each other all day,

33:46.760 --> 33:49.680
it's party time in the villa.'

33:49.760 --> 33:50.880
This is a bit of me.

33:50.960 --> 33:55.120
Gold party.
Gold candles, gold grapes.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.440
Oh, my God. They're actually grapes!
You can eat them!

34:00.520 --> 34:03.320
What did I tell you? It is a grape.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.920
I am loving this.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.520
'But what they don't know is,

34:07.600 --> 34:11.920
the Tablet of Terror
has invited an all-star VIP.'

34:14.199 --> 34:16.840
Budgie smugglers.
They are sparkling.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.440
Not being funny, I kinda like them.
I'm taking them to Ibiza.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.120
There's a set of legs for you!

34:22.199 --> 34:23.920
(tablet chimes)

34:24.000 --> 34:26.920
(groans)

34:27.000 --> 34:28.280
Shitter!

34:28.360 --> 34:30.600
I'm getting heart palpitations.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.639
For fuck's sake!

34:32.719 --> 34:36.880
Gaz, please welcome the new arrival,

34:36.960 --> 34:40.199
by sounding the gong.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.520
Shit.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.360
(screaming)
I feel sick. I feel sick.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.679
How the fuck can an ex
just pop in here?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.480
I feel sick. I feel sick.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.560
I would rather
hit myself in the head

34:51.639 --> 34:53.960
and knock myself out
than hit this gong,

34:54.040 --> 34:55.280
if it's Lillie.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.200
Drum roll. Drum roll.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.440
Ready?

34:58.520 --> 35:03.120
My hand are literally shaking,
I can't feel my legs.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.960
(gong sound)

35:06.040 --> 35:07.640
("O, Fortuna" plays)

35:22.080 --> 35:24.040
Ashley King is my ex.

35:24.120 --> 35:29.120
I fancy Ashley.
I wish I didn't. But I do.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.560
The king is back.
Long live the fucking king!

35:31.640 --> 35:33.760
I've just been sick in my mouth.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.880
Gold hot pants?!

35:36.960 --> 35:40.000
Gold matching teeth?

35:40.080 --> 35:41.880
And a crown?

35:41.960 --> 35:44.920
Honestly, he looked
like a fucking twat.

35:47.400 --> 35:51.880
My name's Ashley and I'm the baddest
motherfucker to ever be here.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.240
I got kicked out for bad behaviour.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.120
One of my exes is Kayleigh.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.840
As soon as she sees me,
she'll want the ride.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.520
She's only human.
I am the fucking beast.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.200
This is my show and I'm back to show
these pretenders what it's about.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.240
Here he comes.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.080
(cheering)

36:11.160 --> 36:14.280
Kayleigh, how's things? Long time.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.960
I'm not getting mugged off
by Ashley Kane again.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.520
If he thinks that's gonna happen,
he's got another thing coming.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.040
Cheers to Ashley!

36:26.120 --> 36:29.080
Oh, my God. The love of my life
has just entered the villa.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.280
Who do you fancy out of the girls?

36:31.360 --> 36:33.600
I'd fuck the lot of them,
doesn't matter.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.280
Girls, be ready.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.640
All us girls have just got
a bit of a minge twinge.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.800
'To welcome the new King Ashley,

36:46.880 --> 36:49.960
the girls have decided
to play spin the bottle.'

36:50.040 --> 36:51.680
'Hashtag, minge twinge.'

36:51.760 --> 36:52.760
It's a game.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.080
Competition!

37:00.400 --> 37:01.800
Give me Ashley Kane.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.280
(cheering)

37:12.720 --> 37:14.360
(tablet chimes)

37:15.760 --> 37:17.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fuck off!

37:17.920 --> 37:19.080
Right.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.280
"Tonight, the real king is back."

37:21.360 --> 37:22.440
What?

37:22.520 --> 37:24.400
"And he needs to pick his queen."

37:24.480 --> 37:27.960
"Choose a lady to take
to the penthouse."

37:29.400 --> 37:33.640
Is it a lady? Or can we choose two?
Cos I wanna choose two.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.480
Pick one girl.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.160
A queen. Not queens. You thick fuck.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.200
I've done the one girl thing.
It's time to choose two.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.720
The beast has gotta do
what he's gotta do.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.480
I'm gonna pick Olivia.

37:48.640 --> 37:52.000
I'm in there like swimwear.
He is fit as fuck.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.280
Jem, you two are friends,
you can come as well.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.200
All right then, let's go.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.600
Hawley's fucked me over.
Bring it on.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.000
See you later, folks. Take it easy.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.000
This is a fucking joke.

38:10.080 --> 38:14.760
'It looks like history's
repeating itself, Gaz.'

38:14.840 --> 38:16.360
'It is all-stars.'

38:22.640 --> 38:26.040
The kid's came in, he hasn't
got the things I've got going on,

38:26.120 --> 38:31.320
waiting for an ex to come in
and a girl, confusing shit.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.720
I don't understand how he thinks
he's this king, or alpha male.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.560
Let's have a cheers to the king.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.400
Let's enjoy it, yeah?

38:39.480 --> 38:41.920
Put your glasses there,
you know you want to.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.720
Apparently Gaz has been
trying to have threesomes.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.360
Time for me to show him
how to do it.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.920
He will fuck them, then fuck
someone else the next day.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.480
He will fuck them,
but he doesn't respect them.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.720
They're both gonna get fucked.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.000
You can now get with Holly.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.800
Everyone now has seen
your true fucking colours.

39:07.400 --> 39:07.600
.
