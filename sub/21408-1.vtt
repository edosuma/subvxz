Help! Help! They're loonabricks!

01:24.251 --> 01:26.386
Hurry up, they'll be here soon.

01:34.494 --> 01:37.397
Stop right there, evildoers!

01:37.464 --> 01:38.565
How was that?

01:38.631 --> 01:39.766
- Commanding enough?
- Perfect.

01:39.832 --> 01:42.269
I loved the way you said "Evildoers."

01:42.335 --> 01:44.237
If I were doing evil,
I'd be scared stiff.

01:44.304 --> 01:45.905
Aw, thanks!

01:45.972 --> 01:47.474
You guys are the best.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.042
Let's grab a Krypton
kale smoothie after this.

01:50.109 --> 01:51.544
Bumblebee? Katana?

01:51.611 --> 01:53.079
What are you two doing here?

01:53.145 --> 01:54.614
We heard there was a break-in.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.115
And...

01:56.182 --> 01:58.084
Great Hera, it's them?

01:58.150 --> 01:59.619
They're the thieves?

01:59.686 --> 02:02.088
How could our classmates
from Superhero High be thieves?

02:02.154 --> 02:05.224
Principal Waller would have totally
caught that in their application.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.226
We have the jewels, it's time to go.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.495
You were saying?

02:11.264 --> 02:12.865
Guys, this is so weird.
What are you...

02:12.932 --> 02:14.901
We really need to have
a talk with admissions.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.203
You couldn't have just
pushed the door open?

02:17.270 --> 02:18.905
Glass doors aren't cheap, you know.

02:18.971 --> 02:21.040
- Hurry up, they're getting away.
- Let's stick together.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.409
I'll drive.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.277
- There goes our smoothie time.
- Seatbelts.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.179
Batgirl, Wonder Woman and I
are pretty much indestructible.

02:27.246 --> 02:28.881
Besides, we can fly.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.116
Why are we even...

02:30.182 --> 02:31.918
- Point taken.
- Yeah.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.020
Watch out.

02:34.086 --> 02:35.722
Why in the world would
Bumblebee and Katana

02:35.788 --> 02:37.724
suddenly decide to become criminals?

02:37.790 --> 02:40.793
And why would they try and
make a fast getaway in rush hour?

02:54.841 --> 02:55.975
Waste food much?

02:59.912 --> 03:01.614
Whoa, what's happening?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.884
Batmobile, eat your heart out.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.419
You should really be using your blinker.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.988
- Faster, they're gaining on us.
- Not for long.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.692
Hi-ya!

03:13.726 --> 03:15.628
- Uh, Batgirl?
- I see them.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.375
- Don't lose them.
- I don't lose anything.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.901
What about those earrings I loaned you?

03:29.903 --> 03:30.778
Never lose a thing!

03:36.082 --> 03:37.950
Giant construction thing.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.660
Uh, that was close.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.796
Don't worry, I got this.

03:50.963 --> 03:52.499
Pardon us, citizen.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.673
Oh, man, you see the look
on that guy's face?

04:02.442 --> 04:04.777
What are you guys doing?

04:33.973 --> 04:35.708
Huh? Argh!

04:40.046 --> 04:42.949
Uh, did anyone notice the
"Do Not Enter" sign back there?

04:43.015 --> 04:44.484
- Nope.
- Probably a dead end.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.786
That means they have nowhere to go.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.625
Okay, that was impressive.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.160
Yet at the same time...

04:55.828 --> 04:56.963
- Time to ditch.
- Agreed. Batgirl?

04:57.029 --> 04:58.565
No, wait, I got this.

05:03.235 --> 05:05.705
You are so gonna be
my partner in shop class.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.574
I can't see them.
Supergirl?

05:09.108 --> 05:11.343
There, they're headed
toward that alleyway.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.045
- Turn here.
- Here?

05:13.112 --> 05:15.114
- No, the next one.
- Okay, next time, you guys can fly.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.916
They must be inside, let's go.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.886
They could be hiding.

05:19.952 --> 05:20.753
Be careful.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.821
What was that?

05:21.888 --> 05:23.556
Sorry. Breakfast burrito.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.825
- Not that, I heard it too.
- Uh-oh.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.760
- I vote, we go home now.
- Seconded.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.628
Thirded.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.598
I don't feel so good.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.667
Uh-oh, Kryptomites.

05:34.734 --> 05:37.637
That would explain...

05:39.872 --> 05:43.309
Let's see if we can
make these good girls

05:43.375 --> 05:44.376
bad.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.314
Uh, which good girls?

05:48.380 --> 05:50.883
I'm not there so I don't really
know who you're referring to.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.919
I wasn't talking to you, specifically.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.287
I was just pontificating
to myself, and...

05:55.354 --> 05:56.556
You know what?
Never mind.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.890
Well, if we're supposed to be partners,

05:57.957 --> 05:59.559
we should pontificate together.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.794
- Like, about evil stuff.
- Can we talk about this later?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.395
I have to go before I'm spotted.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.264
Spotted by whom?

06:05.331 --> 06:06.933
Again, I'm not there, I don't really...

06:14.674 --> 06:17.644
Whoa, that was the weirdest dream.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.113
Oh, I'm gonna be late!

06:22.481 --> 06:24.684
Huh, where is everybody?

06:24.751 --> 06:25.985
Oh!

06:30.890 --> 06:32.559
Good thing you slept in your clothes.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.827
Oh, mean Amazon.
Go away.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.163
And now, to rope me a Supergirl.

06:37.229 --> 06:38.731
Good morning, sunshine.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.601
I need super beauty rest.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.302
Come on, ladies.
We're going to be late.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.271
Morning people, blech!

06:45.337 --> 06:46.639
I heard that.

06:49.876 --> 06:50.877
Huh?

06:53.212 --> 06:54.714
What's that over there?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.619
What? I don't see anything.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.120
Huh, my mistake.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.959
Looking good, Diana.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.967
Ah!

07:15.034 --> 07:16.335
- Ready?
- Ready.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.037
Let's do this thing.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.295
Today's the day. The Yearbook Club
is going to release the results

07:43.362 --> 07:45.231
of the Most Likelies.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.367
"Most Likelies"? Is that another
strange ritual like spin-the-bottle?

07:48.434 --> 07:50.336
Oh, I just heard about this.

07:50.402 --> 07:52.772
It's where people vote on who is
most likely to do stuff in the future.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.073
Like, be president.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.308
Or open a Big Belly burger franchise.

07:56.375 --> 08:00.412
Oh, well, in that case, I think
the most logical choice is Batgirl.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.114
Because she's so smart, right?

08:02.181 --> 08:04.550
You're so sweet.
But I totally think it's gonna be you.

08:04.617 --> 08:08.454
I mean, Amazon Princess,
heir to the power of the gods.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.322
Am I right or am I right?

08:10.389 --> 08:12.124
Well, maybe it will be me.

08:13.325 --> 08:14.794
What? It could be.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.428
I mean, look at my cousin.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.398
He's become the most popular
superhero in the whole world.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.100
Eh. That's debatable.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.136
And I'm just as cool as he was
when he was in high school.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.604
Also debatable.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.407
Well, whoever wins the award,
let's make a promise right now

08:28.474 --> 08:30.009
to be supportive of each other.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.210
Deal.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.413
Oops, I've got her.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.153
Kind of funny how often that happens.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.587
- Right?
- It's okay.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.024
But what's not okay is that.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.594
I know, right? At least spring
for a hybrid in this day and age.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.362
Is that Principal Waller's car?

08:50.429 --> 08:52.531
Yup, I can tell by the license plate.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.869
Odd choice.
I mean, it's kind of off-putting.

08:56.936 --> 09:00.239
Like she has some sort of wall that's
forever up and no one can break through.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.408
Pretty sure that's not her intent.

09:02.474 --> 09:04.911
But how do you know? It could be
a cry for help. We should talk to her.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.445
What happened to the amethyst?

09:06.512 --> 09:08.915
In the wrong hands, that
could be a serious problem.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.984
Then why isn't it, like, kept
in a locked room or something?

09:12.051 --> 09:14.821
Whoever did this is going
to get detention for a year.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.222
My money's on Beast Boy.

09:16.288 --> 09:19.291
I mean, it's just sitting there,
out in the open.

09:19.358 --> 09:20.693
At least it was.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.394
It makes the building look cool, okay?

09:22.461 --> 09:25.531
Seems like a pretty high-stakes
sacrifice to make for aesthetics.

09:25.597 --> 09:27.366
Let's go, I heard from a source

09:27.433 --> 09:29.736
there's going to be a pop quiz today.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.137
What source?

09:32.939 --> 09:34.440
Good morning, class.

09:34.506 --> 09:35.341
"Source", huh?

09:35.343 --> 09:39.446
Well, it's a "pop" quiz
and he is my pop.

09:39.511 --> 09:42.681
I'm handing back the pop quiz
we had yesterday.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.150
- Yesterday?
- I'm sorry to say

09:44.216 --> 09:47.419
that some of you didn't
do as well as I'd hoped,

09:47.486 --> 09:51.891
despite his or her
remarkable upbringing.

09:55.527 --> 09:56.929
A C-minus?

09:56.996 --> 09:59.732
But I've never gotten
a C-minus in my life!

09:59.799 --> 10:02.601
That's like a bat-ugh.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.004
C-minus? That means...

10:05.071 --> 10:08.507
♪ I beat you, I finally beat you ♪

10:08.574 --> 10:10.676
♪ And you wear meat shoes ♪

10:10.743 --> 10:13.645
Okay, clearly I haven't really
worked out the lyrics yet.

10:13.712 --> 10:17.183
But it looks like the race for
the highest GPA is just about over,

10:17.249 --> 10:18.918
and you are looking at the winner.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.186
Whoo-hoo!

10:22.254 --> 10:25.257
I meant me, of course, in case
you didn't get what I meant.

10:25.324 --> 10:28.394
Uh, I didn't really point
at myself or anything, so...

10:28.460 --> 10:29.862
You stink.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.764
I don't even remember taking this.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.065
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.133
Jinx!

10:34.200 --> 10:36.635
Sorry, I just learned that one too.

10:36.702 --> 10:39.806
Hope we didn't miss
a gym class pop quiz too.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.774
That's actually not a thing.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.444
Uh, creepy much?

10:45.511 --> 10:48.214
I've got a bad feeling about this.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.582
All right, you plastic-headed
delinquents.

10:50.649 --> 10:54.253
It's time for you to exercise that teenage
angst away with some physical activity.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.223
Let's play some super dodgeball.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.127
Hey, I'm on your team.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.796
Oh, after what you did yesterday?

11:03.863 --> 11:05.497
You can eat my team.

11:05.564 --> 11:08.367
You're out Batgirl, take a seat.
Never mind, you're already in one.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.942
Oh, Hades.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.476
All right, Princess, take a seat.

11:18.777 --> 11:19.912
Come on!

11:19.979 --> 11:22.014
Uh, can we talk about this?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.627
Nicely done, Supergirl.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.498
All right, you bricks. Looks like
you're ready for some sit-ups.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.766
How about 10...

11:40.833 --> 11:42.334
...thousand.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.440
This has been such a weird day.

11:48.507 --> 11:52.344
A solid two on my top 10 list
of weird days.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.512
What's number one?

11:53.579 --> 11:55.547
Facing Giganta after
that chili cook-off?

11:55.614 --> 11:57.683
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah, that was a gas factory.

11:57.749 --> 12:00.686
But still, I wonder
what's gotten into everyone.

12:00.752 --> 12:02.154
As if you don't know!

12:02.221 --> 12:03.689
- Know what?
- How about the fact

12:03.755 --> 12:07.193
that you uploaded
that embarrassing video of me

12:07.259 --> 12:09.428
on your Hero Hotline page!

12:09.495 --> 12:11.297
Without my permission!

12:11.363 --> 12:14.433
What? I don't even go on Hero Hotline.
Too many ads.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.872
♪ I'll be your hero ♪

12:19.939 --> 12:21.807
♪ You'll be my clown ♪

12:21.874 --> 12:24.676
How is that any different from
the other videos that you post of us?

12:24.743 --> 12:28.014
I spent my entire life, i.e.,
the past three months

12:28.080 --> 12:29.715
trying to make something viral.

12:29.781 --> 12:34.120
And little Miss Bat Ears over
there posts one video of me

12:34.186 --> 12:37.056
and whammo!
She gets all the credit.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.125
Whoa, look at that view count!

12:39.191 --> 12:40.993
Congratulations, Harley.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.861
You've reached cat video status.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.064
Whoa, I got like 2k more followers.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.134
That's it! This wrong must be righted.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.768
I challenge you to a...

12:49.835 --> 12:53.005
- Dance-off?
- No, that wouldn't even be fair.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.740
I challenge you to a...

12:54.806 --> 12:56.475
Medusa head throwing contest?

12:57.876 --> 12:59.378
What? It's a thing.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.612
Um... No!

13:00.679 --> 13:02.949
I challenge you to a...

13:03.849 --> 13:05.151
Well, what?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.019
Well, I don't actually
have anything, okay?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.554
I'm... I'm still thinking.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.356
Oh, I know!

13:10.422 --> 13:12.458
All right, you know the rules.

13:12.524 --> 13:15.694
Whoever eats the most
in one minute wins.

13:15.761 --> 13:16.895
Are you ready?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.430
So there's really only one rule?

13:18.497 --> 13:20.199
You said "rules", so I was just...

13:20.266 --> 13:23.702
Wait, I thought you said
this was a pie-eating contest.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.272
It is. These are pot pies.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.108
Pot pies are filled
with vegetables and meat.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.111
Regular pies are filled
with love and sugar.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.779
Which is terrible for your teeth.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.647
Aw, what's the matter?

13:35.714 --> 13:37.116
- Scared?
- No.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.018
I just don't like to consume
that many nitrates.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.819
And lima beans make me gassy.

13:46.792 --> 13:47.994
Oh, it's on, girl!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.395
I'm powering through this.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.430
Okay then.
On your mark.

13:52.664 --> 13:53.966
Get set.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.035
Eat.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.778
That is a lot of microwaved gravy.

14:11.750 --> 14:15.087
Some of these are
still frozen in the middle.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.634
Argh!

14:33.572 --> 14:34.973
Ten more seconds.

14:36.642 --> 14:37.643
Huh?

14:40.512 --> 14:42.748
She's inhuman!

14:45.584 --> 14:47.019
Time.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.954
Wow, seriously.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.622
That was impressive.

14:50.689 --> 14:51.757
And also gross.

14:51.823 --> 14:54.726
It just takes discipline and focus.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.596
Something that some people don't have.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.931
Yeah, but you know what I do possess?

14:59.998 --> 15:01.400
- What?
- Timing.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.005
What is the meaning of this?

15:07.939 --> 15:10.008
Yeah. Great timing.

15:11.943 --> 15:15.214
Do you know how hard it is
to get gravy out of your hair?

15:15.281 --> 15:16.548
Tell me about it.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.017
- Not as hard as pudding.
- I expect more from you.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.286
Really? Even Harley?

15:20.352 --> 15:21.887
Actually, Harley, you're dismissed.

15:21.953 --> 15:24.090
- I am?
- Gift horse, girl.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.024
I'm sorry, Principal Waller,

15:26.092 --> 15:27.626
it kind of escalated and...

15:27.693 --> 15:30.662
I think you still have
a lima bean in your hair.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.232
I'm sorry.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.633
After the stunts you pulled yesterday,

15:34.700 --> 15:36.502
you'll need more than an "I'm sorry."

15:36.568 --> 15:39.838
Yesterday? Why does everyone
keep talking about yesterday?

15:39.905 --> 15:41.039
Really?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.209
Vandalizing the Hero Ball Arena,

15:44.176 --> 15:46.578
releasing bats in the halls,

15:46.645 --> 15:48.247
and kicking my car

15:48.314 --> 15:49.681
onto the top of the school.

15:49.748 --> 15:54.853
Who, me? I would never
do something like that.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.624
Lois Lane reporting live
from Super Hero High School,

15:58.690 --> 16:00.692
where a few of the students
took it upon themselves

16:00.759 --> 16:03.262
to wreak havoc throughout the campus.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.432
Supergirl created a little
Kryptonian chaos

16:06.498 --> 16:10.402
as she made a super mess
of the school's Hero Ball arena.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.817
It was a particularly dark night
for the cleaning crew,

16:25.884 --> 16:28.297
who still haven't found
all of the nocturnal

16:28.299 --> 16:30.390
nasties Batgirl let loose in the hall.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.324
Come on, who writes this stuff?

16:32.391 --> 16:36.828
And finally, the Amazon Princess
shows off her athletic ability

16:36.895 --> 16:41.099
by kicking Principal Waller's car
into the eye of the amethyst tower.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.368
Goal!

16:44.436 --> 16:49.541
The amethyst still remains missing as does
any punishment for the crazed classmates.

16:49.608 --> 16:53.245
I'm Lois Lane, and clearly
it's been a slow news day.

16:53.312 --> 16:56.948
Still sticking to the "I never
do anything like that" shtick?

16:57.015 --> 16:58.484
That's clearly doctored.

16:58.550 --> 16:59.851
I can't hold a note that long.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.987
You have one chance
to make things right.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.756
I want to know where the
amethyst you stole yesterday is

17:04.823 --> 17:06.124
and I want to know now.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.792
But yesterday was Sunday,

17:07.858 --> 17:09.161
we weren't even in school.

17:09.228 --> 17:10.862
Don't play dumb with me, Ms. Gordon.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.665
Yesterday was Monday
and today is Tuesday,

17:13.732 --> 17:15.367
the day you're expelled.

17:16.234 --> 17:17.502
No!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.075
Huh, I guess, I can hold
a note that long.

17:24.142 --> 17:25.676
What just happened?

17:25.743 --> 17:28.446
This feels exactly like when
I was forced to leave Krypton.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.749
The school has been
like a second home to me.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.252
So much for becoming
"Most likely to succeed."

17:33.319 --> 17:35.120
Without a high school diploma,

17:35.187 --> 17:39.191
the only thing we're most likely
to succeed at is a dead-end job.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.759
Like politics.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.695
How could all three of us
not remember an entire day?

17:43.762 --> 17:44.863
That's true.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.366
Something's as fishy
as Poseidon's breath.

17:47.433 --> 17:51.069
And believe me, that's fishy, phew.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.671
You can smell underwater?

17:52.738 --> 17:54.373
I might know how we can
get to the bottom of it.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.907
- How?
- By analyzing the footage

17:55.974 --> 17:58.510
that I swiped from
Principal Waller's office.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.512
To the Batgirl bunker.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.926
So it's less of a bunker

18:14.993 --> 18:16.895
and more of a gizmo shack.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.630
The footage isn't doctored.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.832
As for as I can tell,
it really is us doing all of this.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.368
Cool! What's this one do?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.869
There, you see that glow?

18:23.935 --> 18:26.104
Oh, that's my new shampoo.
Really adds some shine.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.073
Nothing adds that much shine.

18:28.139 --> 18:29.140
A diamond?

18:29.207 --> 18:30.509
A really big diamond.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.278
But how come we can't see it?

18:32.344 --> 18:33.745
The shampoo.

18:33.812 --> 18:34.946
Serious volume.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.215
That's so weird,
I had this dream last night

18:37.283 --> 18:38.950
that Bumblebee and Katana
were robbing a jewelry store

18:39.017 --> 18:40.185
and they had this
weird look in their eyes

18:40.252 --> 18:42.153
and their hair was glowing too

18:42.220 --> 18:43.789
and we were all like, "Stop, evildoers!"
And then we went on this chase

18:43.855 --> 18:45.123
and there was fighting
and we ended up at a...

18:45.190 --> 18:46.191
- Warehouse.
- Yeah.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.993
Wait, how did you know that?

18:48.059 --> 18:50.028
And, why do villains always hang
out in abandoned warehouses?

18:50.095 --> 18:52.030
We all had the same dream.

18:52.097 --> 18:53.164
But that's impossible.

18:53.231 --> 18:55.367
Unless it wasn't a dream at all.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.403
Whoever was controlling
Katana and Bumblebee

18:57.469 --> 18:59.805
must have used the same
diamond to control us.

18:59.871 --> 19:02.274
And make us steal the amethyst.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.576
But why make us do all the silly pranks?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.112
I don't know. Comedy?

19:07.178 --> 19:09.315
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to check the dorms.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.916
To look for Bumblebee and Katana.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.217
Good idea.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.819
Katana hasn't returned those nun chucks

19:13.885 --> 19:15.787
she borrowed from me,
like, eight months ago and...

19:15.854 --> 19:17.323
Hey, wait for me!

19:21.293 --> 19:23.629
I told my boss that you two were good.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.597
I told her we could count on you.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.433
But we got away with the diamonds.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.235
Barely. Lena Luthor
is a girl of her word.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.237
And you two almost cost me that word.

19:32.304 --> 19:35.807
But we actually didn't, and that
sentence didn't overly make sense.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.343
Well, then, where are the jewels?

19:37.409 --> 19:38.877
- Diamonds.
- Ugh, whatever.

19:38.944 --> 19:39.845
Yes, where are they?

19:39.911 --> 19:42.213
- We hid them.
- Ohh... Phew.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.615
- You hid them?
- Yes.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.950
And that doesn't answer my question.

19:45.016 --> 19:46.084
What was the question again?

19:46.151 --> 19:47.152
Where are my jewels?

19:47.218 --> 19:48.487
- The diamonds?
- Ugh, whatever.

19:48.554 --> 19:49.521
- Yes.
- They're safe.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.357
- At?
- My room.

19:51.423 --> 19:55.193
- So you hid stolen, magic jewels...
- Diamonds.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.628
I know already, ugh.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.931
So you hid stolen,
magic diamonds in your room?

19:59.998 --> 20:02.601
- Yeah.
- At Super Hero High School.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.410
Yeah.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.638
Where there are a lot of,
like, superheroes.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.340
Well, technically they're not
full-blown superheroes yet.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.408
But the teachers are.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.809
Not all of them.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.544
Some are just cops
or, like, business dudes.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.180
Anyway, get me those diamonds

20:15.246 --> 20:16.648
and bring them back here.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.085
Well, what are you waiting for?

20:20.151 --> 20:22.388
Well, it's, like, the middle
of last period right now.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.989
We should probably
wait about 10 minutes,

20:24.055 --> 20:26.425
so we get there right when
the last bell rings. You know?

20:26.492 --> 20:28.994
Otherwise, we have to get
tardy slips and...

20:29.060 --> 20:31.062
Fine, go in 10 minutes.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.476
This is going to be a long 10 minutes.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.880
That's weird, where is everybody?

20:48.947 --> 20:50.716
Almost perfect.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.551
Maybe Harley knows.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.886
Hey, Harley.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.254
Oh, it's you.

20:56.321 --> 20:59.024
Hold on a sec while I finish
my project for art class.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.693
Wow, Harley, that's amazing.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.496
And here I thought you were
holding a grudge against Batgirl

21:04.563 --> 21:06.498
for that embarrassing video
she posted of you.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.299
Not helping.

21:08.366 --> 21:09.401
Uh, I don't know.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.969
It needs a little something.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.638
Oh, I got it.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.877
Ha! Perfect.
That's A-plus material for sure.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.246
Harley, listen, this isn't my fault...

21:21.312 --> 21:23.014
Let me handle this.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.950
Harley, yesterday, we had a
dream that Bumblebee and Katana

21:25.016 --> 21:26.985
robbed a jewelry store
in Metropolis and they...

21:27.052 --> 21:30.589
"Rob"? Those two square pegs?
Ha, you kidding me?

21:30.656 --> 21:32.257
Well, do you know
where they were yesterday?

21:32.323 --> 21:34.493
Yesterday, they were...

21:34.560 --> 21:37.563
You know, I don't remember.
But honestly, that's nothing new.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.699
I can barely remember what I
was doing five minutes ago.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.501
Oh, you were smashing
that bust you made of Batgirl.

21:42.568 --> 21:46.004
Anyway, for argument's sake
let's say they did rob a store.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.339
Do either of them have a place
where they stash things

21:48.406 --> 21:50.141
they don't want anyone to know about?

21:50.208 --> 21:53.044
Oh, for sure, follow me.

21:53.111 --> 21:56.515
Bumblebee thinks I don't know
about her hiding spot.

21:57.415 --> 21:58.617
But really,

21:58.684 --> 22:02.220
could it be any more obvious? Ha.

22:02.287 --> 22:03.855
Yeah. So obvious.

22:03.922 --> 22:07.225
I mean, if she is going to
hide something, it would be...

22:07.292 --> 22:08.860
Uh-oh.

22:08.927 --> 22:10.562
These aren't what you were
looking for, were they?

22:10.629 --> 22:11.963
What are you guys doing in my room?

22:12.030 --> 22:14.500
Oh... Hi, Bumblebee.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.135
Do you happen to know why there
are a bunch of stolen jewels

22:17.202 --> 22:19.705
in your super-secret safe that
only you think is super-secret?

22:19.771 --> 22:21.807
You'll all find out soon enough.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.314
- Can you see her?
- I can't even see you.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.482
And you're right in front of me.

22:30.549 --> 22:31.517
Actually I'm behind you.

22:31.583 --> 22:32.751
My point exactly.

22:32.818 --> 22:33.785
Supergirl, X-ray vision.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.120
Oh, good idea.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.590
There she is,
she's headed for the window.

22:38.657 --> 22:39.658
Where's the window?

22:39.725 --> 22:40.926
Again, can't see anything.

22:40.992 --> 22:42.561
I got it.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.600
Wow, you should totally
try out for the swim team.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.502
Supergirl, are you okay?

22:51.603 --> 22:53.238
That wasn't so bad.

22:53.304 --> 22:55.073
Come on, we have to go after her.

23:02.548 --> 23:07.653
Gross, did you eat yesterday's
tuna in the caf today?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.388
Followed by a lot of goat cheese?

23:10.455 --> 23:12.824
- I did.
- Harley, you still have that mini-jet?

23:12.891 --> 23:16.194
Sure, it's conveniently hovering
right outside the window.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.829
Okay, thanks, bye!

23:18.764 --> 23:20.699
Batgirl, wait for us.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.568
Hey, that's my new jet.

23:22.634 --> 23:23.869
She better not scratch it.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.871
Come on, she's going to need our help.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.576
Oh, hey, Principal Waller,

23:30.642 --> 23:32.410
what brings you around the dorms?

23:32.477 --> 23:34.546
Hey, that looks just like...

23:34.613 --> 23:35.814
Uh-oh.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.293
All right, Harley, let's see
what this thing can do.

23:50.361 --> 23:51.396
Okay, that's creepy.

23:53.498 --> 23:54.700
Got you!

23:55.500 --> 23:57.035
What? Look out!

24:03.675 --> 24:06.144
Uh, my bad.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.278
Don't worry, Batgirl,

24:07.345 --> 24:08.847
I've got her.

24:26.297 --> 24:27.699
Come on, Harley.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.901
There has to be something
in here that can help.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.837
Well, this is definitely an emergency.

24:31.903 --> 24:35.106
Please enter
your four-digit code thingy.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.442
Ugh, four digits, are you kidding me?

24:37.508 --> 24:38.777
Come on, Babs, it's Harley here.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.045
How hard could it be?

24:40.111 --> 24:41.847
Maybe it's her birthday?

24:41.913 --> 24:43.649
Code thingy inaccurate.

24:50.021 --> 24:52.057
Code thingy inaccurate.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.327
I have an IQ of 210

24:56.394 --> 24:59.297
and I can't figure out Harley's
four-digit code thingy?

24:59.364 --> 25:00.932
Come on. No. Wait.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.801
H-A-H-A.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.803
Turbo boost thingy initiated.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.538
Technically, those aren't even digits...

25:11.843 --> 25:12.978
Get out of the way.

25:13.044 --> 25:15.947
Out-of-control clown jet.

25:20.451 --> 25:22.453
Where's my Bat barf bag?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.956
For barf bag, please enter
four-digit code thingy...

25:25.023 --> 25:27.025
Oh, shut it, dashboard Harley.

25:30.228 --> 25:33.732
Another uneventful day
as a window washer.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.234
Where nothing out of
the ordinary ever...

25:48.646 --> 25:49.915
Ehh...

25:54.385 --> 25:55.453
Huh?

25:58.023 --> 26:00.726
Batgirl, shut down the engine.

26:00.792 --> 26:01.827
Right. Hold on.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.731
Stupid airbag.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.333
HARLEY: Please enter your four-digit...

26:08.399 --> 26:09.600
Argh, come on.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.737
I can't hold it...

26:13.839 --> 26:16.474
Huh? Supergirl.

26:22.313 --> 26:23.381
I think I got it.

26:23.448 --> 26:24.649
Z-Z-Z-Z.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.988
Okay, I'm going back
to stand-up. Much safer.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.229
Okay, Harley's code thingies
made no sense.

26:38.296 --> 26:40.899
If it wasn't for that, I would
have had Bumblebee for sure.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.569
And you wouldn't have endangered
yourself and civilians in the process.

26:44.635 --> 26:47.238
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Thanks for helping out there.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.439
I really appreciate it.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.842
Mmm, it's okay.
That's what friends are for.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.878
But it looks like we lost Bumblebee.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.180
Ugh, she was our only lead.
What do we do now?

26:55.246 --> 26:57.415
Just retrace our steps from yesterday

26:57.482 --> 27:00.385
and find some clues as to who was
controlling us and what they were up to.

27:00.451 --> 27:01.653
How are we going to do that?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.548
By accessing the GPS software that's

27:03.550 --> 27:05.191
embedded in each of
our wrist communicators.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.725
Oh, man, why didn't we
just start with that plan?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.828
Uh, we needed the action sequence.

27:11.797 --> 27:15.466
There, those dots indicate the
two places we stopped yesterday.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.701
Where's the nearest stop?

27:16.768 --> 27:19.237
There, it looks like...
Huh? That's weird.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.807
- What is it?
- The Hero Ball Arena.

27:24.475 --> 27:26.344
Are you sure we came here?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.380
I guess so.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.116
What are you three doing back here?

27:31.182 --> 27:34.685
Lashina.
Aplokoliptian fury.

27:34.752 --> 27:37.122
Powers, electric whips.

27:39.324 --> 27:43.328
Mad Harriet.
Powers, energy claws.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.764
Artemiz.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.900
Powers, she's mean

27:48.967 --> 27:51.502
and she has a bow.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.440
That was weird.

27:55.506 --> 27:57.308
- Oh, is that...
- The Furies.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.244
The Furies.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.378
Okay, we get it!

28:00.445 --> 28:02.948
You're a long way
from Apokolips, ladies.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.851
And I use the term "ladies"
very loosely.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.718
Like Lashina told you yesterday.

28:07.785 --> 28:10.755
We're not leaving until we become
the best hero ball players

28:10.822 --> 28:14.125
this tiny mud ball you call
a planet has ever seen.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.894
What an odd goal to aspire to.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.596
And if you want to come back
for another one,

28:18.663 --> 28:19.931
we want a rematch.

28:19.998 --> 28:20.999
"Another one"?

28:21.066 --> 28:22.300
Another one, what?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.035
Another one, what?

28:24.102 --> 28:25.871
Can you believe the nerve
of this girl, Artemiz?

28:25.937 --> 28:27.338
Let's raise the stakes.

28:27.405 --> 28:30.141
If we win, you have to go
live on Apokolips.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.211
And we get to go
to Super Hero High School.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.113
You guys would get a lot of detentions.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.883
Still not sure what
"another one" is referring to.

28:37.949 --> 28:39.417
And if you lose?

28:39.484 --> 28:41.752
Artemiz, Mad Harriet
and I will leave Earth.

28:41.819 --> 28:43.554
For good.
Now, enough talking.

28:43.621 --> 28:44.755
Play or leave.

28:44.822 --> 28:46.357
Okay, if we're able to beat them,

28:46.424 --> 28:49.194
we'll be one step closer
to getting "another one."

28:49.260 --> 28:51.196
And also knowing
what's going on in general.

28:51.262 --> 28:52.563
What do you think, Wonder Woman?

28:52.630 --> 28:54.933
Uh, it's hero ball.
This will be a breeze.

28:58.803 --> 28:59.670
WONDER WOMAN: By Hera.

28:59.737 --> 29:01.606
It'll be a breeze, huh?

29:01.672 --> 29:03.574
Oh, come on. Where are the girls
that played for keeps yesterday?

29:03.641 --> 29:05.043
First to 400 wins.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.912
Uh, 25 to zero.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.646
So, I guess we're going
to be here all day.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.681
We can do this.

30:00.665 --> 30:04.802
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper,
whisper, whisper. Whisper, whisper.

30:04.869 --> 30:05.903
No, that's nuts!

30:05.971 --> 30:08.273
Nuts, or brave?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.610
Go long, Wonder Woman.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.034
We won?

30:36.101 --> 30:38.936
We won!

30:41.606 --> 30:44.209
Here, you won it fair and square.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.145
If you ever want a rematch,

30:47.212 --> 30:48.946
you know where to find us.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.087
A mother box? Why would
we need a mother box?

30:56.154 --> 30:57.855
Hopefully, the next set of coordinates

30:57.922 --> 30:59.024
will give us some idea

30:59.090 --> 31:00.558
of what's going on.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.892
- Where does it say we went?
- Strange.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.494
It's coming from the waterfront.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.696
Oh, goodie! I've been meaning
to test something out.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.237
So, the super hero girls
came back to the arena?

31:12.303 --> 31:13.904
That's, like, weird.

31:13.971 --> 31:15.006
They wanted a rematch.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.041
Now we are 0-2.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.143
So, you let them win again?

31:18.209 --> 31:21.246
Well, we weren't sure if this was, like,
another set up ruse type thing, or...

31:21.312 --> 31:22.780
Why would I send them back?

31:22.847 --> 31:24.749
They already got the mother
box from you yesterday.

31:24.815 --> 31:27.318
Well, again, your directives
weren't really clear.

31:27.385 --> 31:27.902
So...

31:27.904 --> 31:29.455
And how many of those mother box things

31:29.520 --> 31:31.122
do you guys carry around
with you anyway?

31:31.189 --> 31:32.723
That information is classified.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.393
- No less than 2,000 at all times.
- Okay, look,

31:35.460 --> 31:37.762
you ladies seem nice-ish.

31:37.828 --> 31:40.065
But I'm sending you to...

31:43.134 --> 31:44.202
Jersey...

31:44.269 --> 31:45.536
We've been to worse.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.472
- In the 80's.
- How's that even possible?

31:47.538 --> 31:50.007
I have the Boom 2, with
my cosine temporal fractal

31:50.075 --> 31:52.477
displacement coach
and algorithmic reverter.

31:54.345 --> 31:56.981
Dude, I can't believe that player
with the kneepads made that

31:57.048 --> 32:01.018
three-pointer while solving a 3D-cube
puzzle and voting for that actor guy,

32:01.086 --> 32:03.454
all while watching the last
episode of that sitcom

32:03.521 --> 32:05.623
and simultaneously being
a guest on a talk show.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.426
And I so love friendship bracelets, man.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.095
No!

32:10.161 --> 32:12.763
- I can't pull off legwarmers.
- At least make it the early '90s.

32:12.830 --> 32:16.067
Sorry, girls, enjoy the
sitcoms and shoulder pads.

32:17.902 --> 32:20.438
You told us we'd be able to
go to Super Hero High School

32:20.505 --> 32:21.639
once you took control of Earth.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.808
Yeah, it's true that I said that,

32:23.874 --> 32:25.476
but a lie that I meant it.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.117
Can't you just send us
back to Apokolips?

32:34.085 --> 32:38.656
You mean the evil place with all
the lovely, burning fire pits?

32:38.723 --> 32:41.826
At least the video games
there won't be 8-bit!

32:47.432 --> 32:49.700
Actually, those 8-bit games
are really making a comeback.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.069
Doesn't mean they still don't stink.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.072
At least we'll have hair metal.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.541
What the heck is hair metal?

32:56.607 --> 32:58.476
What about the roaring '20s
instead of the '80s?

32:58.543 --> 33:00.077
Atlantic City was all the rage.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.212
Stop talking, Artemiz.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.647
- Ladies!
- What?

33:02.713 --> 33:03.714
Bye.

33:08.419 --> 33:10.020
Man, it would be cool to see

33:10.087 --> 33:12.257
a hair metal band in their prime.

33:13.023 --> 33:14.559
Eh!

33:14.625 --> 33:17.228
So, your spaceship
transforms into a boat?

33:17.295 --> 33:18.729
- Yeah.
- You can fly.

33:18.796 --> 33:19.797
Why do you need a boat?

33:19.864 --> 33:21.031
Well, on that logic,

33:21.098 --> 33:22.300
- why do I need a spaceship?
- Huh.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.601
- Interesting.
- There!

33:23.668 --> 33:25.102
That's where it says we went yesterday.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.272
That doesn't look ominous at all.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.376
Why would we come to LexCorp?

33:31.442 --> 33:33.911
Uh, apparently you mean LameCorp.

33:33.978 --> 33:36.113
I'm going to bet that was me.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.184
Yup, definitely me.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.885
- Hello!
- Shh.

33:40.951 --> 33:42.753
You'll alert whoever's here
that we are too.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.722
- Isn't that the idea?
- She's got a point.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.532
- That wasn't me.
- No.

33:54.599 --> 33:55.566
It was me.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.169
- Lena Luthor?
- Lemme guess,

33:58.236 --> 34:00.538
she told you to stop by and make sure

34:00.605 --> 34:02.507
the amethyst is ready for transport.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.409
The amethyst? So, you have it?

34:04.475 --> 34:07.077
Duh, You brought it here yesterday,

34:07.144 --> 34:08.679
or don't you remember?

34:08.746 --> 34:10.248
Maybe you don't.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.417
I think she said there was some
sort of amnesia side effect,

34:12.483 --> 34:15.320
but ironically I don't recall.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.822
Was it something I said?

34:17.888 --> 34:19.924
Uh, yes. You are right.

34:19.989 --> 34:22.393
She told us to take the amethyst to her.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.862
What's wrong with your voice?
Ow!

34:24.929 --> 34:26.130
Not that I even felt that,

34:26.197 --> 34:27.532
but I'm trying to be more empathetic.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.868
Fine. Follow me.
I have it strapped

34:30.935 --> 34:32.770
to my car.

34:34.170 --> 34:35.473
There it is. Tell her I'll

34:35.540 --> 34:37.375
rendezvous with her at
the designated location.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.777
- We'll do that.
- Totes.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.312
Hold on a second!

34:41.379 --> 34:43.313
No jewel?

34:43.380 --> 34:44.649
You're not being possessed?

34:44.715 --> 34:48.319
Only by the spirit of justice!

34:48.386 --> 34:50.255
Sorry, just seemed like the jig was up.

34:50.321 --> 34:51.956
- Agreed.
- The jig was still down woman!

34:52.022 --> 34:54.925
So, it was you who used us
to steal the amethyst

34:54.992 --> 34:58.796
- and get a mother box.
- And make me fail my forensics exam!

34:58.863 --> 35:01.065
What? That's a felony in my book.

35:01.131 --> 35:03.368
You better tell us what's
going on, or else...

35:03.434 --> 35:05.135
- Or else, what?
- Or else,

35:05.202 --> 35:06.704
you'll be headed up the river!

35:06.771 --> 35:09.840
And I have no idea why
that phrase means jail,

35:09.907 --> 35:11.175
but it does.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.044
Uh-oh, I won't be stopped that easily.

35:14.111 --> 35:16.881
Kryptomites, come to me!

35:19.350 --> 35:21.686
Oh, man, red and green ones?

35:21.752 --> 35:25.055
No wonder I feel angry
and sick at the same time.

35:25.122 --> 35:26.624
What's the matter, Lena?

35:26.691 --> 35:28.259
Couldn't find any henchmen who
wanted to be around you,

35:28.326 --> 35:30.295
so you manufactured some of your own?

35:30.361 --> 35:33.197
Yep, nail on the head, Buttgirl!

35:33.264 --> 35:34.565
They don't look so scary,

35:34.632 --> 35:35.933
kind of cute actually.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.669
I take it back, I take it back!

35:40.170 --> 35:41.506
Creepy little freaks!

35:42.940 --> 35:43.941
Shoo!

35:44.742 --> 35:46.076
Shoo!

35:46.143 --> 35:47.378
Shoo!

35:47.445 --> 35:49.314
Ah, there are too many of them.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.581
I've got this.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.722
Lena, she's getting away.

36:00.124 --> 36:01.292
Where's she gonna go?

36:01.359 --> 36:03.328
The only road out leads
to the waterfront.

36:11.869 --> 36:14.104
My boat transforms too.

36:14.171 --> 36:15.940
Just sayin'.

36:22.313 --> 36:23.514
Huh?

36:28.085 --> 36:30.888
In the immortal words of
the Kryptonian philosopher

36:30.955 --> 36:31.956
Keanu...

36:32.022 --> 36:33.491
Whoa...

36:33.558 --> 36:36.761
Hey, I'm just gonna sit
this one out, okay?

36:36.827 --> 36:39.497
I'm feeling a little bit woozy.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.366
I'll go after Lena.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.335
Wonder Woman, you take care of
Supergirl and big ugly over there.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.814
- Can you move?
- No, but I can cheer you on.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.883
Yay, you!

37:34.351 --> 37:37.422
Catch me in that hunk of junk?
Ha!

37:39.356 --> 37:40.758
Heat vision, heat vision.

37:42.159 --> 37:45.963
We're good at designing
little button icons.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.949
Okay, Lena, how about this?

38:18.596 --> 38:22.132
I knew we shouldn't have added the
arctic freeze feature to a boat.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.169
Ugh!

38:29.740 --> 38:31.175
- Any ideas?
- Two.

38:31.241 --> 38:33.177
Isn't your favorite band
called Opposite Direction?

38:33.243 --> 38:35.480
Yes. Their next album drops
in like, two days.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.414
I am beyond excited.
Do you love them too?

38:37.482 --> 38:39.484
No! Well, maybe, like, one song.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.151
That one they overplayed last summer.

38:41.218 --> 38:42.920
Oh, Your Kiss is My Rainbow?

38:42.987 --> 38:44.722
- No, not that one.
- I Live for Your Butterfly Teardrop?

38:44.789 --> 38:46.491
- No.
- My Heart Rides a Unicorn With You?

38:46.557 --> 38:48.025
- Definitely not.
- I, Like, Think I, Like, Love You?

38:48.092 --> 38:49.760
- No.
- Glitter Girl in My Backpack?

38:49.827 --> 38:50.928
- No.
- Rockin' Love Boat Totes Magoats?

38:50.995 --> 38:52.262
- No.
- He Gave Me His Digits?

38:52.329 --> 38:53.031
- No!
- Whip of Love?

38:53.098 --> 38:55.132
That's the one.
Anyway, their name...

38:55.199 --> 38:57.234
- Opposite Direction?
- Yes, is my first idea...

38:57.301 --> 39:00.370
- And your second idea?
- Red Kryptonite makes you angry, right?

39:00.437 --> 39:01.639
Good.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.075
Hold this.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.044
Oh, I'll hold this.

39:08.278 --> 39:10.080
Now, opposite direction.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.613
Sorry we can't stick around.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.682
You'll just have to do that for us.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.651
That is called a pun.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.852
I know what puns are!

39:47.918 --> 39:49.720
We have them in my language too,

39:49.787 --> 39:52.089
and they aren't any funnier in English.

39:52.156 --> 39:55.860
Oh, and maybe we should hit them again!

39:55.926 --> 39:57.562
Uh...

39:57.628 --> 40:00.631
Phew! Thanks, that was intense.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.500
BATGIRL: Ha!

40:03.568 --> 40:05.135
Nowhere to go now, Luthor.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.738
Unless you're, like,
a really strong swimmer.

40:07.805 --> 40:09.774
That's where you're wrong.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.146
We'll meet again, Batgirl,

40:16.213 --> 40:19.249
and next time, you'll join
your friends in bowing

40:19.316 --> 40:20.851
before their new ruler.

40:22.987 --> 40:26.523
And that would be me, FYI.

40:26.591 --> 40:27.958
- She got away.
- Don't worry.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.927
- We'll find her.
- Hopefully, before she uses

40:29.994 --> 40:32.763
the amethyst for whatever
evil plan she's concocted.

40:32.830 --> 40:35.132
I might have an idea about that.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.770
Whoever Lena is working for
needed two things.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.906
Amethyst and a mother box.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.307
If put together correctly,

40:43.373 --> 40:45.409
they can create a
huge dimensional gateway.

40:45.475 --> 40:47.912
How do villains always figure
out this weird junk?

40:47.978 --> 40:49.614
- Gateway to where?
- My guess is,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.081
they are using the mother box

40:51.148 --> 40:53.183
to circumvent the safeguards
on the amethyst,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.653
so they can open up
a gateway to Gemworld.

40:55.720 --> 40:59.056
But why?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.525
- His ears must have been ringing.
- Ladies,

41:01.592 --> 41:03.327
it's Vice Principal Grodd.

41:03.393 --> 41:05.195
It seems we have made a mistake.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.564
Principal Waller has
reviewed the videos,

41:07.632 --> 41:10.901
and now knows you were under
some sort of mind control.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.370
She's willing to let you
back in the school.

41:13.437 --> 41:14.705
With Principal Waller's help,

41:14.772 --> 41:16.206
we can round up the rest of the heroes,

41:16.273 --> 41:18.342
and stop Lena before it's too late.

41:18.408 --> 41:19.644
Finally, a break.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.879
So, are you ready to return to school?

41:21.946 --> 41:23.714
Yes, just in the nick of time too.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.515
We found out who stole the amethyst.

41:25.582 --> 41:27.351
- Besides you, you mean?
- Right.

41:27.417 --> 41:30.520
What I meant to say is that we
know who was mind-controlling us.

41:30.587 --> 41:31.956
Lena Luthor.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.658
We need to talk to
Principal Waller right away.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.159
She's waiting for you.

41:35.225 --> 41:37.161
After you, ladies.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.269
So, Grodd, my dad tells
me you play cribbage?

41:45.335 --> 41:46.603
- No.
- Okay.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.839
I'm all out of small-talk cards to play.

41:53.944 --> 41:56.146
Uh, I don't think this is a pep-rally.

41:56.213 --> 41:58.348
Not for you, it isn't.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.818
Eclipso!

42:00.885 --> 42:03.220
I should have guessed
you'd be behind this insanity.

42:03.287 --> 42:05.656
Lena could never come up
with this idea on her own.

42:05.723 --> 42:08.125
Whatevs, I come up
with lots of evil plans.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.628
I'd tell you about them, but they're...
They're evil

42:11.696 --> 42:13.463
and secret.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.066
What's no secret is that you are
trying to create a dimensional portal.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.668
But I'm guessing you didn't expect

42:17.735 --> 42:19.103
we'd be looking into our missing day.

42:19.169 --> 42:22.039
Honestly, I didn't think
you were that smart.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.107
Behold!

42:24.742 --> 42:26.643
Uh... Yeah?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.879
A mind-control diamond.

42:28.946 --> 42:32.616
Lena's technology and my magic,

42:32.683 --> 42:34.151
a perfect combination.

42:34.218 --> 42:37.154
It gives us complete control
on whoever we use it on,

42:37.221 --> 42:39.256
with the added benefit of giving

42:39.323 --> 42:41.591
the wearer short-term amnesia.

42:41.658 --> 42:43.127
See, I told you I was smart.

42:43.193 --> 42:44.995
SUPERGIRL: Oh, man,

42:45.062 --> 42:47.131
- and clumsy.
- I meant to do that.

42:47.197 --> 42:49.299
Soon, I'll use the mother box

42:49.366 --> 42:52.970
to circumvent the amethyst's safeguards,

42:53.037 --> 42:56.240
and with my army
of mind-controlled Supers,

42:56.306 --> 43:00.244
I'll take my rightful place
as the ruler of Gemworld.

43:00.310 --> 43:02.747
Not if we have anything to say about it.

43:02.813 --> 43:05.449
That's why you won't
have anything to say,

43:05.515 --> 43:07.017
period. Attack!

43:14.291 --> 43:17.762
You never were a very
good student, Wonder Woman.

43:22.032 --> 43:24.368
You always told me to aim
higher, Coach Wildcat.

43:24.434 --> 43:27.204
You should have never come to
this school, Supergirl.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.773
You're telling me, banana breath.

43:28.839 --> 43:30.775
No more monkeying around.

43:30.841 --> 43:33.811
Say night-night.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.081
As your principal, if you give up now,

43:37.147 --> 43:38.482
I won't give you detention.

43:42.419 --> 43:44.454
You can't give me detention, remember?

43:44.521 --> 43:46.023
I've been expelled.

43:46.090 --> 43:49.760
You can't win. The entire
school is under our control,

43:49.827 --> 43:52.396
including its mutt of a mascot.

43:54.098 --> 43:56.633
Mutt? He's a pure breed,

43:56.700 --> 43:58.168
I'll have you know.

43:58.235 --> 43:59.303
Uh, this is bad.

43:59.369 --> 44:00.905
That's a good Krypto.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.472
Nice pooch.

44:03.941 --> 44:05.242
I can buy us a couple of seconds,

44:05.309 --> 44:07.411
but you have to come up with something.

44:07.477 --> 44:09.546
Krypto, here boy!

44:09.613 --> 44:11.115
Fetch!

44:11.181 --> 44:13.717
- Ha! Stupid mutt.
- Pure breed,

44:13.784 --> 44:15.452
and he loves him a game of fetch.

44:15.519 --> 44:17.888
Supergirl, below us is
the boom tube room.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.890
Yeah, so?
This is hardly the time

44:19.957 --> 44:21.691
to be thinking about
taking a trip out of...

44:21.758 --> 44:23.427
Oh!

44:31.035 --> 44:33.137
Quick, to the Batgirl bunker.

44:35.072 --> 44:36.406
Should we go after them?

44:36.473 --> 44:38.242
It doesn't matter,
they're too late as it is.

44:38.308 --> 44:40.577
We must get the portal generator ready.

44:40.644 --> 44:43.981
Our homecoming is at hand!

44:44.048 --> 44:47.017
I can't believe she took
control of Krypto.

44:47.084 --> 44:48.986
He's never harmed a fly.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.720
Well, except for that giant one

44:50.787 --> 44:52.022
that attacked Metropolis last week.

44:52.089 --> 44:54.391
But still, that was totally justified.

44:54.458 --> 44:57.027
Enough hiding, I say we
take the fight to them.

44:57.094 --> 45:00.097
But how? We still don't know where
Eclipso is going to open this

45:00.164 --> 45:01.698
dimensional portal.

45:01.765 --> 45:03.333
Well, that isn't exactly true.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.769
I was able to surreptitiously
throw a tracker on Eclipso.

45:05.836 --> 45:07.504
- No way!
- Wait.

45:07.571 --> 45:11.108
All I have to do is
activate it and voila!

45:11.175 --> 45:12.609
Huh. That can't be right.

45:12.676 --> 45:14.811
- What?
- My tracker's relaying coordinates,

45:14.879 --> 45:16.746
but coming from the moon.

45:16.813 --> 45:19.816
The moon, again?
Are you kidding me?

45:19.884 --> 45:21.385
What are you doing now?

45:21.451 --> 45:22.887
I'm hacking a few satellites
to point in the direction

45:22.953 --> 45:24.821
of the GPS signal from my tracker.

45:26.323 --> 45:28.225
Well, it seemed to be coming
from a dark side,

45:28.292 --> 45:29.559
but there!

45:29.626 --> 45:31.461
Eclipso's palace?
We destroyed that thing.

45:31.528 --> 45:33.898
It must have taken forever
to reassemble.

45:33.964 --> 45:35.599
Well, reassembling is fun.

45:35.665 --> 45:38.035
I count at least 10 guard ships
around their base.

45:38.102 --> 45:39.403
We'll need to be stealthy.

45:39.469 --> 45:41.238
They'll see us coming from miles away.

45:41.305 --> 45:44.909
- What we need to be is... Invisible.
- Exactly.

45:46.810 --> 45:48.212
Do we have time for this?

45:48.278 --> 45:50.547
I mean, Eclipso, impending doom.

45:50.614 --> 45:52.416
Hold on to your ears, Batgirl.

45:52.482 --> 45:54.018
All will be revealed.

45:54.084 --> 45:58.588
- You know, like, literally.
- An empty aircraft tanker, again.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.290
- I don't get it.
- Of course!

46:00.357 --> 46:02.459
But, how do we even find...
Oh! Ow!

46:02.526 --> 46:04.528
- Oops, watch your heads.
- Still not getting it.

46:07.264 --> 46:10.935
All right!
Now, this is super cool.

46:11.001 --> 46:12.402
How does it stay invisible?

46:12.469 --> 46:15.305
It uses advanced Amazon technology.

46:15.372 --> 46:17.074
- You have no idea, do you?
- Not a clue.

46:17.141 --> 46:18.875
- Can it get us to the moon?
- It should.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.945
It has all the powers of the gods.

46:21.011 --> 46:24.714
Including a brand new Hermes warp drive
that should get us there in no time.

46:24.781 --> 46:29.019
- Now, seatbelts.
- Safety first. I like it, Wonder Woman.

46:33.057 --> 46:37.427
Mummy! Mummy! I see three girls flying
through the air, sitting on their butts.

46:37.494 --> 46:38.495
Shh... Mummy is texting.

46:40.164 --> 46:41.898
All right, everyone, hold on.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.900
I'm initiating the Hermes drive.

46:44.601 --> 46:46.003
And... We're here.

46:46.070 --> 46:49.373
Cool, even has a synthetic
atmosphere bubble.

46:49.439 --> 46:53.243
Thank goodness.
That space suit is totes uncomfortable.

46:55.712 --> 46:58.415
Have the guard ships spotted
anything unusual?

46:58.482 --> 47:02.252
Nope. Looks like the superheroes
aren't so smart after all.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.653
I actually said that earlier.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.590
Although you did kind of
divulge the entire plan

47:06.656 --> 47:07.992
back there in the gym, so...

47:08.058 --> 47:09.659
That was before I knew they
would escape.

47:09.726 --> 47:11.728
Why don't you just hypnotize them again?

47:11.795 --> 47:14.564
Because then they wouldn't have
known how diabolical my plan is.

47:14.631 --> 47:16.033
I don't get why that is important.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.267
Because you're shortsighted.

47:17.334 --> 47:19.003
How is that... Wait... What?

47:19.069 --> 47:21.405
Soon, Gemworld will be mine.

47:21.471 --> 47:22.606
You mean "ours"?

47:22.672 --> 47:24.374
Oh, right. Ours.

47:24.441 --> 47:27.011
Can't wait to see the look on
my brother Lex Luthor's face

47:27.077 --> 47:28.878
when he sees how supervillainy I am.

47:28.945 --> 47:31.748
- Now, how would you do that?
- I don't know, vidchat?

47:31.815 --> 47:33.183
Can you vidchat from Gemworld?

47:33.250 --> 47:34.985
Well, Earth will be destroyed
in the process,

47:35.052 --> 47:37.521
so your brother most likely
won't be around much longer.

47:37.587 --> 47:39.556
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I misspoke.

47:39.623 --> 47:42.026
- Oh.
- He definitely won't be around.

47:42.092 --> 47:44.028
He... He had a good run.

47:44.094 --> 47:45.929
Sure, whatever helps you cope.

47:45.996 --> 47:48.999
I was totes posthumously presumptuous.

47:49.066 --> 47:49.967
What?

47:49.969 --> 47:52.670
I said cool pop stickers
are scrumptuous.

47:52.736 --> 47:55.705
Agreed. Although sometimes
they can be too oily.

47:59.943 --> 48:03.013
What about the guards? Don't
you think they'll notice three girls

48:03.080 --> 48:04.581
floating across the surface of the moon?

48:04.648 --> 48:06.783
Not to worry.
When I use the cloaking field

48:06.850 --> 48:10.454
we won't be able to be detected by
anything. Technological or otherwise.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.822
Why wouldn't you just
have that on all the time?

48:12.889 --> 48:14.924
Hmm. Yeah.

48:14.991 --> 48:16.526
Okay.

48:23.033 --> 48:26.103
- Hold on.
- I thought you said they can't see us.

48:26.170 --> 48:27.471
They can't.

48:32.008 --> 48:33.477
What is going on?

48:33.543 --> 48:36.613
Nothing on the radar.
Ceasefire! Ceasefire!

48:38.048 --> 48:40.117
Nothing on the radar.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.918
Get back to your patrols.

48:41.985 --> 48:46.123
This new batch of Kryptomites
needed to cook longer.

48:49.326 --> 48:50.356
What was all that about?

48:50.358 --> 48:52.630
Oh, uh, slight malfunction
with my Kryptomites.

48:52.696 --> 48:54.631
I thought you said these creepy freaks

48:54.698 --> 48:57.801
were your most technologically
advanced invention to date.

48:57.867 --> 48:59.269
Well, they are.

48:59.336 --> 49:01.438
It's just... Rome wasn't built
in a day, okay?

49:01.505 --> 49:02.297
What's Rome?

49:02.299 --> 49:04.675
Some place that took
a long time to build.

49:04.741 --> 49:07.311
Uh, but came out awesome.
I'm sure.

49:07.377 --> 49:10.714
No matter. But what were your
creep-totites reacting to?

49:10.780 --> 49:12.682
Kryptomites!

49:12.749 --> 49:15.319
And like I said, they had a slight
malfunction, but it's been handled.

49:15.385 --> 49:16.853
Hmm.

49:16.920 --> 49:17.654
What?

49:17.656 --> 49:19.857
Deploy our hypnotized students
into the catacombs.

49:19.923 --> 49:24.428
- But why?
- Because apparently our superhero girls

49:24.494 --> 49:27.531
are not as dumb as we thought they were.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.772
I don't see any way in.
Supergirl?

49:35.839 --> 49:39.709
Argh, this place is made with magic.
My X-ray vision can't penetrate it.

49:39.776 --> 49:41.578
There! That must be an exhaust port.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.813
If I know space architecture
like I think I do,

49:43.880 --> 49:46.816
I'm betting that leads to
the center of the palace.

50:02.732 --> 50:04.568
Okay, girls, let's fly.

50:07.171 --> 50:10.740
Don't worry about me, I'll
just be here, not able to fly.

50:10.807 --> 50:12.976
- Which way?
- My super hearing is picking up

50:13.042 --> 50:15.779
- something to the left.
- My Amazon instincts say we go right.

50:15.845 --> 50:18.815
That seems random. What if
we were hanging upside down?

50:18.882 --> 50:20.116
Then right would be left.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.419
Lucky for both of you,
my keen detective skills

50:22.486 --> 50:25.322
tell me that the center of the
building is straight ahead.

50:25.389 --> 50:27.056
So, it's settled, we'll go right.

50:27.123 --> 50:28.858
Um, I think you mean left.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.595
We'll never get anywhere arguing.
We all have communicators.

50:31.661 --> 50:34.264
Let's split up.
Whoever finds it first, me,

50:34.331 --> 50:36.065
will radio the other two to join them.

50:36.132 --> 50:37.834
- Fine.
- Agreed.

50:37.901 --> 50:39.636
Now we'll really see
who is the most successful.

51:00.690 --> 51:04.594
Argh! Bumblebee, you've got to stop.
You're being controlled.

51:04.661 --> 51:05.495
Fight it!

51:05.562 --> 51:07.397
It feels so good to be bad.

51:21.411 --> 51:24.481
- Huh?
- Nowhere to go, Batgirl.

51:30.720 --> 51:34.958
There's always someplace to go.
Sorry about that, Bee.

51:53.910 --> 51:55.679
I just ran into Bumblebee. Be careful.

51:55.745 --> 51:58.181
There might be more
of our classmates out there.

51:58.248 --> 52:00.550
Thanks for the tip.

52:04.153 --> 52:07.457
Because you're my friend,
I'll go easy on you.

52:09.693 --> 52:11.495
I'll give you no such quarter.

52:11.561 --> 52:13.430
I'd be disappointed if you did.

53:07.584 --> 53:09.819
You were a worthy adversary.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.960
Just floating around an empty hallway,

53:17.026 --> 53:19.829
in a super evil chick's
scary palace on the moon.

53:19.896 --> 53:22.231
Totes normal again.

53:22.298 --> 53:25.301
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey.

53:26.035 --> 53:27.537
Flash?

53:27.604 --> 53:30.440
Let me guess.
Eclipso's got you seeing black.

53:33.843 --> 53:36.780
Well, that escalated quickly.

53:40.283 --> 53:43.420
So that's the way you want
to play it, quick and easy?

53:43.487 --> 53:45.889
Let's see if you can outrun this.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.928
You think you're running the show?

53:53.630 --> 53:55.599
Enough with the silly puns already.

53:55.665 --> 53:57.401
Got to run.

54:04.874 --> 54:07.677
Need a flashlight?

54:08.978 --> 54:11.715
You may be super-fast, but I can fly.

54:11.781 --> 54:14.951
And FYI, those puns were awesome.

54:24.093 --> 54:25.695
Place it in the machine.

54:28.765 --> 54:30.033
Sheesh,

54:30.099 --> 54:31.935
thing looked a lot smaller way
up on top of that building.

54:32.001 --> 54:34.838
Uh, Gail, can we get more guys on this?

54:34.904 --> 54:37.607
And don't forget to order that
gift for my Aunt Trudy.

54:43.947 --> 54:46.983
It's time.
Kryptomites, leave us.

54:48.084 --> 54:50.119
Victory is at hand.

54:52.989 --> 54:55.792
- Okay, so it's a tie.
- Here we are.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.694
Supergirl, think you can
unlock this door?

54:57.761 --> 55:02.398
I'm open to seeing what's
behind door number one.

55:02.466 --> 55:05.869
Yeah, sorry. I was doing
this pun thing with Flash.

55:05.871 --> 55:07.004
Never mind.

55:13.610 --> 55:16.580
Now, the mother box.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.417
With the push of this button,

55:21.485 --> 55:24.420
the age of Eclipso is set to begin.

55:25.689 --> 55:27.156
Knock! Knock!

55:32.195 --> 55:34.163
You troublesome teenagers.

55:34.230 --> 55:38.267
There's nothing you can do to
stop me from destroying the Earth

55:38.334 --> 55:39.836
and ruling Gemworld.

55:39.903 --> 55:42.405
Don't you mean stop us
from ruling Gemworld?

55:42.472 --> 55:45.942
Uh, that's what I meant.
There's nothing you can do to stop us...

55:46.009 --> 55:47.777
- Thank you.
- From ruling Gemworld.

55:47.844 --> 55:51.615
We'll see about that.
Let's get 'em, girls.

55:51.681 --> 55:55.652
Don't bats like to spend
their time upside down?

56:03.860 --> 56:06.896
I'm stuck.

56:08.665 --> 56:14.103
Normally I set my gun to five,
but for you, I'll turn it up to 11.

56:14.170 --> 56:16.706
You don't have to do this, Lena.

56:16.773 --> 56:18.942
There's still time to do
the right thing.

56:19.008 --> 56:22.178
This is the right thing for me.

56:31.420 --> 56:35.692
Give up now, Supergirl.
You'll lose ground eventually.

56:35.759 --> 56:39.829
The only one losing ground
today is you, Eclipso.

56:42.699 --> 56:44.467
I'm on fire with these puns.

56:44.534 --> 56:45.518
My staff!

56:45.520 --> 56:48.472
I'll take that.
Let's see if there's an off button.

56:50.473 --> 56:52.508
That's enough playtime.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.620
Yes, I can feel it.

57:03.687 --> 57:07.490
My home world's magic
is fueling my staff,

57:07.557 --> 57:10.126
increasing my power.

57:10.193 --> 57:12.596
- Did you know she could do that?
- No clue.

57:12.662 --> 57:14.798
Nothing can stop me now.

57:14.864 --> 57:15.965
Nothing!

57:16.032 --> 57:19.068
Time to rid myself of these
pesky rodents.

57:25.208 --> 57:28.578
Do you really think she'd share
control of Gemworld with you?

57:28.645 --> 57:30.747
Ha! No, but I'm not stupid.

57:30.814 --> 57:32.916
Well, let's say you have book smarts.

57:32.982 --> 57:36.720
When she got comfortable, I was going to
betray her and take control of the Earth.

57:36.786 --> 57:38.855
But she said that the Earth
would be destroyed.

57:38.922 --> 57:41.224
Yeah, but I didn't know that
when I made the deal.

57:41.290 --> 57:44.427
See, book smarts and street
smarts are two different things.

57:44.493 --> 57:45.895
What do you know?

57:45.962 --> 57:47.797
Enough to get an agreement
like that in writing.

57:47.864 --> 57:50.299
Well, I'm still taking her
purple face down.

57:50.366 --> 57:53.136
You against Eclipso?
And how would you accomplish that?

57:53.202 --> 57:55.471
With a mind control override device.

57:55.538 --> 58:00.509
I was going to take control of the Supers
and defeat Eclipso once and for all.

58:00.576 --> 58:03.046
- Who's dumb now?
- Holy ringer device.

58:03.112 --> 58:04.881
And thank you, Lasso of Truth.

58:04.948 --> 58:07.183
And your boots are supes gaudy.

58:11.487 --> 58:14.658
- How's it going over there?
- About as good as you could expect.

58:14.724 --> 58:16.192
Oh, that bad, huh?

58:16.259 --> 58:18.928
Too scared to pick on someone
your own size?

58:18.995 --> 58:21.064
No, not scared at all.

58:30.306 --> 58:32.008
No! A power draining pod.

58:37.113 --> 58:37.981
You can't win.

58:38.047 --> 58:40.116
Once the gateway is fully opened,

58:40.183 --> 58:44.187
I will be able to use
my magic to transport my army

58:44.253 --> 58:45.889
of Supers to Gemworld.

58:45.955 --> 58:48.658
And take my rightful place as its ruler.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.694
There must be something
we can do to stop her.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.562
We have to try.
I can't lose my home,

58:53.629 --> 58:57.433
our school, to someone
with seriously whacked hair.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.468
It is whack.

58:59.535 --> 59:03.439
It's no use. Your powers are being drained
by Eclipso's magic in these pods.

59:08.144 --> 59:10.714
Is this how it feels
like to be an ordinary human?

59:10.780 --> 59:12.782
- No offense, Batgirl.
- It's cools.

59:12.849 --> 59:14.751
No way, Batgirl is not ordinary.

59:14.818 --> 59:17.386
In fact, she's the only one whose power
can't be drained by these pods.

59:17.453 --> 59:19.522
You mean like that cool
tongue-roll thing I can do?

59:19.588 --> 59:21.324
No, I mean your mind.

59:21.390 --> 59:23.993
That's right. These pods
are controlled by Eclipso's magic.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.528
But the locking clamps aren't.

59:25.594 --> 59:27.764
You think you can, like, doohickey
us out of these things?

59:27.831 --> 59:30.199
I'm hacking into Lena's
computer system now.

59:34.570 --> 59:38.174
The only reason we've got here
is by working together.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.877
Winning at hero ball,
defeating the Kryptomites,

59:40.944 --> 59:42.645
fighting off the teachers.

59:42.712 --> 59:47.083
The only way we're most likely
to succeed is by working together.

59:47.150 --> 59:48.718
- Together.
- Together.

59:48.785 --> 59:51.354
- Ugh, give me a break.
- What about her?

59:51.420 --> 59:52.889
I got an idea.

59:52.956 --> 59:55.158
You know what I love about mean girls?

59:55.224 --> 59:58.361
- Huh?
- They always end up miserable and alone.

59:58.427 --> 01:00:00.163
How cute!

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.966
The girls think they are going
to beat me with angry stares.

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:05.902
How about some cold air instead?

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:16.445
Your turn, Wonder Woman.

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.583
With the rift's energies
flowing into my staff,

01:00:20.649 --> 01:00:23.052
even you aren't strong enough
to move me, Amazon.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.856
Who said anything about moving you?
I'm just holding you in position.

01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:31.027
Whoa.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.328
No!

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.735
Whoa!

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.151
Whoa, what just happened?

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.553
You ruined everything is what happened.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.992
Uh, girls.

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:06.863
Look, the blast from Eclipso's scepter
must have created a singularity.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.365
English or Kryptonian?
Whatever...

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.700
A black hole!
We have to get out of here.

01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:13.036
Really, we're still doing this?

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:14.503
You may have saved your friends,

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.106
but you won't stop me
from returning to my home.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.675
Mark my words, I'll be back!

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.544
Wow, super original line there.

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:22.778
I wasn't done.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.848
I was going to say, I'll be back,

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:28.317
and when I return, I'll have my revenge!

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.153
Still pretty cliche.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.489
This is an escape pod?

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:36.059
I thought this was,
like, your private bathroom.

01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:44.667
The palace, it's coming down.
We have to go, now.

01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:46.469
I've got the amethyst.

01:01:46.535 --> 01:01:48.271
Split up and find our classmates,
we'll meet back at the jet.

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.940
Hmm... Do we really need to get Flash?

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:53.209
I hate his little victory dances.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.846
- I'm joking. Sheesh.
- Go.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.356
Is that the singularity ma-thingy?

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:09.492
Yes, go, go, go...

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:21.770
Wonder Woman!

01:02:21.837 --> 01:02:23.172
Oh, I see it.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.640
- We're not going to make it.
- We'll make it.

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.775
Batgirl's right.
We're not going to make it.

01:02:26.842 --> 01:02:28.144
I said we're going to make it.

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.585
No, I got this.

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:03.079
We made it.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.147
I told you we'd make it.

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.382
I love this song.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.484
Uh, what about them?

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.553
We'll return them
to school with the others.

01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:11.921
With Eclipso and Lena gone,

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.656
we can retrieve
their mind-control jewels

01:03:13.722 --> 01:03:16.492
and they'll think the last couple
of days were just a bad dream.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.860
"A bad dream"!

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.063
Girls, I've got an idea.

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.029
Got ya! Ha-ha!

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.672
Whoo-hoo.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.276
Aw.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.780
♪ I'll be your hero ♪

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.816

01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:18.954
Hmm...

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.561
Oh, is that it?
Did we get it all?

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:28.697
Yep, now when everyone wakes up
they'll think it was just a bad dream.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.000
And we'll never get expelled.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.501
- Yeah.
- We did it.

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.537
- You guys are the best.
- I honestly love you guys.

01:04:34.603 --> 01:04:36.672
Just what do you three
think you're doing?

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.041
Uh, we're just...

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.243
Looking forward
to another day at school.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.811
Just glad to not be expelled.
Whoops.

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.713
Expelled?

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.516
Strange. Last night I had a dream
I expelled the three of you. Hmm.

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:51.187
No matter. I'm just wondering why you
three ladies are here before classes begin.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.189
Just hoping to get a jump on the day.

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.758
And that's why you always get
straight A's.

01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:57.426
Have a nice day, ladies.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.597
Why do you look so sad, Batgirl?
It worked.

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:05.068
She doesn't remember
the last couple of days at all.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.036
I know, I'm happy for all of that.

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:11.440
I'm just sad we weren't able to change
the grade on my forensics quiz.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.376
No, seriously, that stinks.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:14.777
- You-hoo.
- Uh-oh.

01:05:14.843 --> 01:05:16.879
Oh, sugar, I can't believe it.

01:05:16.945 --> 01:05:21.650
Someone sent a video of me singing
to an executive at Metropolis Records.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.653
They thought the non-auto-tuning
sounded fresh.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.255
I mean, duh. Right?

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.624
They want me to come in and cut a demo.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.626
- That's great, Harley.
- Isn't it though?

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:33.096
I mean, I don't even know
who recorded the thing.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.563
Well, ta-ta.

Well, all's well that ends well.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.638
Anyone seen my jet?

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.440
There is one more thing.

01:05:48.977 --> 01:05:50.813
Huh, I did not expect that.

01:05:50.879 --> 01:05:52.181
Batgirl, what did you get?

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:56.785
What about you, Supergirl?

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:00.789
And you, Wonder Woman?

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.328
But who won
the "Most Likely to Succeed"?

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:08.331
With friends like you, we all did.

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.967
"Most Likely to Succeed"?

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.469
Whoo-hoo!

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.640
Ah!

01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:19.775
I'm the most likely to succeed.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.280
You guys are just dweebs.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.985
BATGIRL: Okay, girls,

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.288
I've got a surprise for you.

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:39.362
How did you manage to get Opposite
Direction to come to Super Hero High?

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:42.030
Their manager owed my dad a favor.

01:06:42.097 --> 01:06:46.001
What? Rock and roll and the law
cross paths, my friends.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.970
This is great, Batgirl.

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:50.873
I mean, although I'm not a big fan,
I'm very happy for you, Supergirl.

01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:52.408
Oh, you heard me, girl.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:57.313
I said Opposite Direction
is performing here, today.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.982
Principal Waller, you're
an Opposite Direction fan?

01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:03.352
Uh, well, uh, I commend
their skill with pentatonic scales

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:05.053
and their melodious infusion

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.924
of R&B with classic pop, which
doesn't feel too anhemitonic in tone.

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.726
Yeah...

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:12.295
Huh?

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.665
Hello, Super Hero High.

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:20.336
I'm Carmine, the window-washer guy.

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.104
And I'm going to be your opening act.

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:24.307
You guys ready for some comedy?

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:27.876
Okay, uh, you know,

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:31.247
I recently gave up my career
as a window washer...

01:07:33.081 --> 01:07:36.018
Yeah, yeah, uh, I decided
I'd try washing mirrors instead

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:38.554
because it's something
I always thought I could...

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.656
See myself doing.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.924
You stink!

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:44.360
Yeah, uh, my life
is pretty much in the toilet.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:47.095
Okay, please welcome Opposite Direction.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.701
