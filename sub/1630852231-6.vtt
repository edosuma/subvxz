WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:10.476
JOHNNY: I am predator-proofing
my camp right now.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.682
More specifically,
this meat cache.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.819
And I'm going to be putting
these some extra stove pipe

00:20.855 --> 00:23.822
that I have, and I'm going
to wrap them around the tree.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.524
Further up, of course.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.092
Once they hit this
metal, their claws,

00:27.128 --> 00:30.796
they can't grip into the tree,
so it brings them right back

00:30.831 --> 00:33.465
to square one.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.001
Everything out here
has access to my fridge,

00:36.037 --> 00:38.837
whether I like it or not.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.940
The animals, they'll take
advantage of anything they see.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.509
If there's food laying around...

00:43.544 --> 00:44.943
Oh, yeah.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.413
They'll help themselves
to whatever they find.

00:48.015 --> 00:52.151
So, I had gotten a caribou,
and it was late in the evening,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.920
so I hung it up here.

00:56.057 --> 00:59.425
And I woke up the next day,
and it was gone.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.063
The bear grabbed the
caribou, ripped it down,

01:04.098 --> 01:06.432
drug it through all the brush,

01:06.467 --> 01:08.300
and it was ripped
open pretty good.

01:08.335 --> 01:11.470
It tore up the ribs and
spread the hindquarters apart,

01:11.505 --> 01:14.173
and there were bear
tracks around it,

01:14.208 --> 01:16.875
so it was pretty obvious
that it was a grizzly bear.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.145
At that point, the bear
has claimed that kill,

01:20.181 --> 01:22.381
so it's its property.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.783
And I felt like I was
trespassing around the caribou

01:24.819 --> 01:26.452
that I had shot at that point.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.654
It was an eerie feeling,
to know that, you know,

01:28.689 --> 01:31.824
that bear could be just
right over in the brush,
or in the bushes,

01:31.859 --> 01:35.661
and it would definitely defend
that kill with its life,

01:35.696 --> 01:37.996
and I'm not ready to die.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.908
I just worry a lot.

01:49.944 --> 01:53.412
This is my food
here, you know,

01:53.447 --> 01:57.282
if they get to the food,
it's, it'll be a tough time,

01:57.318 --> 01:59.118
especially with
these cold temperatures,

01:59.153 --> 02:01.753
to be well fed.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.590
I mean I eat, I eat
quite a bit of fat out here.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.527
It's amazing how my body
adapts to the environment,

02:08.562 --> 02:12.498
and since being out here,
it just craves fat.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.237
I'm a pretty lean guy.

02:18.272 --> 02:22.407
So, it's important to
safeguard the caribou
meat that I do have.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.818
(howling).

02:32.853 --> 02:34.820
Do you hear that?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.022
Wolves.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.925
(howling).

02:39.960 --> 02:42.861
It's probably about a
dozen wolves, at least.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.832
The wolves
concern me with Java.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.234
They come out here, and
they come around the camp,

02:49.270 --> 02:53.238
they try to lure
her away from me.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.708
And their goal is
to take her out,

02:56.744 --> 02:58.443
because they look at
her as competition.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.412
And they try to kind
of flirt with her,

03:00.447 --> 03:02.881
and pull her away from me,
in a way that makes them,

03:02.917 --> 03:05.083
like, not appear dangerous.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.553
And then, once
she's away from me,

03:07.588 --> 03:10.722
that's when they kind of
start to try to circle her.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.059
That's ultimately my
biggest fear with the wolves.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.795
They're not going to
access my meat up here
or anything like that.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.797
I don't have to
worry about that.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.366
I just worry about my dog.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.771
Java! Come here.
Come on. You stay.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.739
Everything out here
is trying to survive,

03:27.775 --> 03:29.508
including myself.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.244
Short term goals are to
stay warm, stay fed.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.580
Don't get killed.

03:39.820 --> 03:43.088
ALEX: I kind of got
impending doom over my
shoulders for the winter.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.058
It's getting colder.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.693
Pretty much whenever
there's a bad situation,

03:47.728 --> 03:50.195
it automatically
goes to worse.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.967
Now that it's winter,
and I just kind of
had a big cold snap,

03:55.002 --> 03:57.302
it was like, 30 below
for a couple days, uh,

03:57.338 --> 03:59.638
it means I spend
more time on my cabin.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.609
And just recently,
I noticed this should
be cool to the touch.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.177
When I got a hot
fire going on in here,

04:05.212 --> 04:06.778
this is getting
just as hot almost.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.081
It's actually, I touched it,
and it burnt me a little bit.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.583
It should not be that hot,
because it's going against the

04:11.619 --> 04:14.186
insulation in there,
and the wood.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.754
So, if this is
getting that hot,

04:15.789 --> 04:17.489
that's a huge fire hazard.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.125
I need to replace this,
basically this whole
chimney system,

04:20.160 --> 04:23.729
uh, which is gonna involve
tearing apart this wall,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.197
and everything.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.599
So, it's gonna be
kind of a big job.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.605
It's about to be the longest,
darkest days of winter.

04:33.641 --> 04:39.244
This is the time of year when
I'm making fires very often,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.413
sometimes all day long,
I have a fire going.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.149
I simply cannot survive
without a wood stove.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.852
Which means the risk of
setting my cabin on fire

04:46.887 --> 04:49.521
is extremely high.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.791
I made a small fire
early this morning,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.394
just to get a little
bit of heat in here.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.296
But the stove's
totally cool now.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.866
And, uh, I won't be making
another fire in here until

05:00.901 --> 05:03.568
I get my chimney replaced.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.038
My cabin is gonna
cool down rapidly.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.673
If my cabin freezes up,

05:07.708 --> 05:10.175
especially if all of my
water freezes, you know,

05:10.210 --> 05:11.443
then I'm left two options.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.779
Go haul more water,
or melt snow,

05:13.814 --> 05:15.414
which takes forever.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.783
It's just a
situation I wanna avoid.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.086
There's time pressure,
but I need to make
sure that I go slow,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.121
because if
I try to go fast,

05:23.157 --> 05:25.891
I'll just make a
mess of things.

05:30.597 --> 05:34.466
KALEB: It's important that
children learn the things that

05:34.501 --> 05:37.669
are necessary to make a
homestead like this function,

05:37.738 --> 05:41.606
so that they can succeed in the
future as they turn into adults,

05:41.642 --> 05:45.844
and become the next
generation of Alaskans.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.228
BRITTANY: Whatcha think, Ellie?
ELOVIE: Cool.

06:03.263 --> 06:06.231
KALEB: The smoker that I'm
building today is just a bunch

06:06.266 --> 06:10.168
of cinderblocks stacked
together in about a
four-foot square shape.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.771
You know that when
Grandpa built this smoker,

06:12.806 --> 06:16.641
his great idea was
to use welding rod
to hold the grates up.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.911
I'm hoping this smoker is an
opportunity to teach my kids a

06:19.947 --> 06:23.115
little more about the
fundamentals of building.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.484
BRITTANY: Keep going. Yeah!

06:25.519 --> 06:26.752
ELOVIE: Haha!

06:26.787 --> 06:28.320
KALEB: And it teaches them a
little more about taking pride

06:28.355 --> 06:30.389
in your work,
doing a good job.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.423
All right.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.091
Shall we try this
screen out, Ellie?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.326
ELOVIE: Yeah.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.495
KALEB: See if
Grandpa's ideas works.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.564
Look at that! It works.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.834
And then, getting to teach them
a little bit about food prep.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.971
Go get some firewood
and torch this off,

06:46.006 --> 06:49.775
and then, we can maybe go
hunt for some fresh game.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.143
You wanna go hunting?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.414
BRITTANY: Ellie, when
Mama was pregnant with you,

06:55.449 --> 06:58.650
Daddy and Gilbert and I
went ptarmigan hunting,

06:58.685 --> 07:01.086
and you were in my belly then!

07:02.489 --> 07:04.489
So, you have gone
ptarmigan hunting.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.458
When you were in
mommy's tummy!

07:06.493 --> 07:09.161
KALEB: Go head on out and get
some fresh meat to put in here,

07:09.196 --> 07:11.863
and while I'm out there,
the whole mountainside is

07:11.899 --> 07:15.467
covered in good alder that
we'll smoke the meat with.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.335
So, I'll bring some
of that back, too.

07:17.371 --> 07:20.038
BRITTANY: Cool.
Come on, Ellie, let's go.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.443
Elovie is always gung-ho
to try different things,

07:24.478 --> 07:26.945
including going
hunting with Kaleb.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.580
I love that, as
she's gotten older,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.782
she's actually
able to go with him.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.452
It's wonderful to be able to
see her grow into herself,

07:33.487 --> 07:36.121
and be able to
do these things.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.561
KALEB: Piper, stay home.
ELOVIE: Stay!

07:42.596 --> 07:45.397
KALEB: Elovie is gonna have
a unique opportunity today.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.632
She gets one on
one time with me,

07:47.668 --> 07:50.268
in the mountains,
doing what I love most,

07:50.304 --> 07:53.171
hunting wild game.

07:53.207 --> 07:56.174
There's no guarantees, I have
not been up to the bowl where

07:56.210 --> 07:57.776
we're going hunting.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.878
There should be a foot,
foot and a half of snow.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.447
And so, we're taking the
snow machine up there,

08:02.483 --> 08:03.782
and we'll just have
to look around,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.951
and see what we can find.

08:09.490 --> 08:14.159
MICHAEL: I take a lot
of pride training and
running a subsistence team.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.028
And so, what you see here,
is you see tradition.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.498
And the tradition is strong.

08:22.135 --> 08:27.138
(barking).

08:28.208 --> 08:30.909
Quiet down, you
little knuckleheads.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.777
You guys are nuts.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.151
You wanna be a sled dog?
Wanna go for a run?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.456
First run.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.125
Earlier today, the
winds come through.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.828
We had white out conditions.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.631
These trees were
snapping and cracking.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.901
I had a great big branch
fall off into the puppy lot.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.370
But things have settled down.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.872
The visibility has improved.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.340
I can actually see around me.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.609
The winds have
dropped down, and so,

09:04.645 --> 09:07.112
this is a perfect time to get
on the trail and start running

09:07.147 --> 09:10.048
these dogs on their first run.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.417
This is the dog
mushing season.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.085
The way I start
my training out,

09:14.121 --> 09:16.588
is I usually tie them up
to a sled with no weight,

09:16.623 --> 09:19.958
get the muscles moving,
get the tendons moving.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.626
Line up, come on.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.295
Line up. Stay.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.565
My goal on this first run is
just getting them back in tune

09:26.600 --> 09:28.300
with their commands.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.870
Getting them
psychologically prepared
to be back on the trail.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.439
Come on.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.575
So, I'm gonna hook up
three dogs at a time,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.910
that's about a
two-mile run total.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.079
Short trips...

09:41.114 --> 09:42.447
Stay!

09:42.482 --> 09:44.783
Actually help the dogs focus.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.619
Eventually, we do back
to back five milers.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.220
Ten milers.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.590
You know, you gotta crawl,
walk, and then, run.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.825
And so, this is
the crawl phase.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.861
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:57.664 --> 10:01.032
Go get 'em! Hyah! Hyah!

10:02.703 --> 10:05.637
Go get 'em! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

10:05.672 --> 10:08.440
Good boys.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.111
These dogs, they love
to be out on the trail.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.947
Come on.
Good boys.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.684
The genetics of the
Malamute, they've been
bred by indigenous people

10:19.720 --> 10:23.888
of the Northwest Arctic for
hundreds of generations

10:23.924 --> 10:27.192
to be kind, courteous...

10:27.227 --> 10:28.493
Gee over.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.328
Powerful, hearty animals.

10:30.364 --> 10:33.531
Awoo!

10:34.968 --> 10:38.637
I can cover 20 to 30
miles a day with these dogs,

10:38.672 --> 10:41.706
hauling 800 pounds of stuff.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.408
Straight ahead.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.677
For me, being an
East Coast Indian,

10:45.712 --> 10:48.680
this is a very
natural way of travel.

10:48.715 --> 10:52.951
It's in my blood, it's
in my ancestors' blood.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.321
Mushing was the way
that things were done.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.860
Whoa!

11:05.165 --> 11:08.099
I'm sorry, guys, your trail.
It's blocked up.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.879
MICHAEL: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.982
Halt. Whoa!

11:25.318 --> 11:28.153
Oh, shoot.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.755
The trail, it's blocked up.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.291
We got two trees down.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.062
This is a little
bit of a problem.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.197
This is my loop that
takes me down to the river,

11:39.232 --> 11:40.965
it gets them their first hill.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.967
Once you start miling them up,
you gotta keep 'em going,

11:43.003 --> 11:45.403
keep 'em going,
every single day.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.138
A couple of trees down over
the trail, it happens.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.808
But unfortunately,
it's the beginning of
the training season.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.409
I can't be
stopped up for this,

11:51.445 --> 11:54.746
so this has gotta
be cleared out.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.149
That's a pretty
violent snap on that tree.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.452
It's not rotten in the
middle, it's a good piece.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.621
I'll buck that
one up as firewood,

12:03.657 --> 12:05.657
and clear it off the trail.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.893
This next one here,
significantly larger.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.995
It's gotta be about
two foot at the base.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.530
I'm making a note.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.401
I need a chainsaw mill,
a small firewood saw.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.069
(barking).

12:18.105 --> 12:20.205
These dogs are really anxious,
they got a lot of energy.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.674
All right, let's get
you turned around.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.876
Go get 'em!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

12:24.911 --> 12:27.178
Good boys.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.919
JOHNNY: I'm living in a place
where humans don't really live.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.523
It's up to me to figure
out how to live out here.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.525
There's not a lot of
second chances that I get,

12:40.560 --> 12:43.628
so I kind of gotta figure it
out the first time around.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.037
Hey, Java, I thought
you were getting the
tool bag for me, huh?

12:53.073 --> 12:55.507
Carry your own weight,
or do you just wanna sit
around and eat all day?

12:57.144 --> 13:00.478
<i>NARRATOR: Having lost</i>
<i>valuable meat to a bear</i>
<i>who came into his camp,</i>

13:00.514 --> 13:04.349
<i>Johnny must protect his</i>
<i>property from anymore damage.</i>

13:04.818 --> 13:07.252
<i>In order to keep</i>
<i>himself and his dog safe,</i>

13:07.287 --> 13:11.289
<i>he must secure any</i>
<i>openings to his cabin.</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:15.093
JOHNNY: You know, a bear
will get into a cabin
if it wants to get in.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.495
They're a lot smarter
than we make them out to be.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.664
But the goal is to
hide this window,

13:19.699 --> 13:21.966
and it doesn't know
there's a window here.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.336
And that's, to me,
outsmarting the bear.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.745
Go ahead, Java.
Get it. There she goes.

13:35.482 --> 13:39.751
She kind of cleans up all
of the construction scraps.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.187
I'm not complaining.

13:42.322 --> 13:46.291
These two pieces will go,
one here and one here.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.260
I'm gonna cut these
shutters to size,

13:49.296 --> 13:53.298
and they'll essentially
be fixed to these two
vertical pieces.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.601
So then, it's just one solid
piece that I just put right up

13:56.636 --> 13:59.070
into this space.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.572
The little projects
that I do out here,

14:00.607 --> 14:01.739
they keep me going.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.541
They keep me positive.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.211
They keep me getting
out of bed every day.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.881
And if I didn't have
little projects to do,

14:09.916 --> 14:12.884
then, you know, it'd
be boring out here.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.653
And I'm not looking
for a boring life.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.457
This is the last
nail for this one.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.196
Nice.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.298
That's a nice, snug fit.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.902
Yeah, I feel a little
safer leaving camp
for longer durations.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.239
The wildlife out
here is abound.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.875
There are critters everywhere.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.910
But, you know, it's like, be
careful what you wish for,

14:38.945 --> 14:41.512
because I've always wanted to
see a lot of these animals,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.248
but I'm seeing a lot of them.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.850
And, you know, every day, it's
like a different animal is

14:45.886 --> 14:47.719
trying to present a
challenge for me.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.088
Java. You wanna go eat?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.556
Come on, let's call it a day.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.858
Come on!

15:00.066 --> 15:01.633
ALEX: When it's cold,
it's cold.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.569
And it stays cold
for a long time.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.738
When it's 40 below
or 50 below outside,

15:06.773 --> 15:09.207
you gotta do a lot
of work to stay warm.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.256
It's pretty dangerous.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.625
I mean, the falling ice tells
you it's way above freezing,

15:27.661 --> 15:29.494
is what it tells you.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.963
Redoing my
chimney is essential.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.033
But it's also gonna
be inherently risky.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.569
My roof is extremely steep,
and it's definitely not safe

15:38.605 --> 15:40.605
for me to just be
standing on a ladder,

15:40.640 --> 15:43.207
doing this kind of
work, unprotected.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.243
If I start to fall,
there's nothing, you know,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.111
there's no, nothing
to catch me on.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.113
So I'll fall all the way down.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.716
So, I need a rope to
hold the, you know,

15:51.751 --> 15:53.918
going over to hold the
ladder from the other side,

15:53.954 --> 15:56.421
so that it can't swing.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.389
And then, also a
rope to hold myself,

15:58.425 --> 16:01.059
uh, on the other side.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.727
Let me grab that.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.329
Basically, I'll have a rope
going across the roof of the

16:04.364 --> 16:06.864
cabin to a tree
on the other side.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.866
The rope will allow
me to work safely,

16:08.902 --> 16:12.503
work confidently, without having
to worry about falling off.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.872
I'll have a harness
that I can clip into it.

16:14.908 --> 16:18.609
That way, there's a nice
tight rope holding me.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.312
So this way, if
I slip or fall,

16:21.348 --> 16:24.415
I'll just lean on the rope.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.585
In order to set up my
kind of rope safety system,

16:27.620 --> 16:29.921
I do have to go up
the ladder unprotected,

16:29.956 --> 16:32.657
and throw a rope over.

16:32.692 --> 16:37.028
I got a heavy iron
shackle on one end to
give it some weight.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.810
I need to kind of
wind up a little more,

16:52.846 --> 16:53.978
which makes me nervous.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.581
I'm working on a ladder on
the side of an icy roof.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.385
You know, I don't wanna fall.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.220
This might be the most
dangerous kind of part,

17:02.255 --> 17:04.889
is just setting up my anchor.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.559
This is one of the situations
where it's not enough that

17:08.595 --> 17:10.094
I just try hard.

17:10.130 --> 17:14.065
I have to do it right, because
if I get injured out here, uh,

17:14.100 --> 17:16.501
even, you know, a
relatively minor injury that

17:16.536 --> 17:19.404
might not be a big deal
if I got hurt in the city,

17:19.439 --> 17:22.073
out here, it can be
a death sentence.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.043
This (bleep) heavy.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.278
(bleep). (bleep).

17:37.624 --> 17:41.059
It's definitely not safe for me
to just be standing on a ladder,

17:41.094 --> 17:42.994
doing this kind of
work, unprotected.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.562
Second time.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.464
But, you know, any
time I'm working alone,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.766
a lot of my time is
spent figuring out all these

17:48.802 --> 17:50.735
different safety systems.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.204
Get the hell off
this death trap.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.972
Now I just gotta
find a good tree,

17:55.008 --> 17:57.108
something nice and solid
to tie my anchor off of.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.377
Something that will
hold my weight if I fall.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.447
There's my rope.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.549
And now I can go set up
the end of the rope that

18:04.584 --> 18:06.918
I will be connected to.

18:06.953 --> 18:11.055
Of course, which I
always wanna do is test it.

18:11.091 --> 18:16.894
So, it should be able to
adjust it as I climb up,

18:16.930 --> 18:20.031
and it will hold my
weight if I fall.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.667
I'm focused on doing
this as safe as I can,

18:22.702 --> 18:25.670
but I got a lot of things
kind of fighting against me.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.672
I got this cold snow
blowing in my face.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.242
Just have the steepness
and the slickness of
this metal roof.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.610
Here it comes.

18:32.645 --> 18:36.781
At this point, my body is pretty
exhausted, but, you know,

18:36.816 --> 18:39.951
I'm still a long ways
from finished with this job.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.552
So, there's no
turning back now,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.855
because now, I don't
have a stove anymore.

18:50.063 --> 18:53.464
MICHAEL: You can't just stop
because something is strenuous.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.002
You gotta keep going.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.371
And so, that's
part of life up here.

19:01.207 --> 19:06.277
Get 'em! Get 'em!
Go get 'em! Good girl!

19:06.312 --> 19:08.646
Look at you go!

19:08.681 --> 19:11.015
All right.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.255
Right out that way
is my five-mile loop.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.656
I gotta get on that.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.558
These dogs have
to keep miling up.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.027
It's time for that
first winter caribou hunt,

19:23.062 --> 19:26.097
and these dogs are
my transportation.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.733
It's very important,
they gotta keep running.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.637
And that will prevent injuries
on the trails during expedition.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.540
I'm gonna go ahead, fire
up my little chainsaw.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.742
Then I'm gonna try to
clear out all this old,

19:37.777 --> 19:40.978
rotten willow.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.990
It seems like I am
attached by a dummy cord
to this darn chainsaw.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.226
What a mess!

19:55.261 --> 19:57.361
I bought it used
for next to nothing,

19:57.397 --> 20:00.631
and it has handled year after
year after year of cutting.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.104
The winds are picking up.

20:07.140 --> 20:12.176
I actually don't like
working around these treetops.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.313
A 60, 70, 80 mile an hour
gust will come through,

20:15.348 --> 20:17.915
and just snap these trees
like they're toothpicks.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.352
Gonna have to hurry
up and clear this out.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.824
Look at that.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.993
My five-mile loop
is clear again.

20:29.028 --> 20:32.663
I just bucked up that
small tree as firewood.

20:32.699 --> 20:36.667
That big tree, I'm just
gonna mill it up real
quick with my saw mill.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.737
It's gonna make
some nice lumber.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.906
And so, I got this
ladder brought out here,

20:41.941 --> 20:43.274
and this is just
to act as a guide,

20:43.309 --> 20:45.643
so my first cut will
be somewhat straight,

20:45.678 --> 20:48.279
and I can continue to cut this
two and a half inches thick

20:48.314 --> 20:51.382
the whole way down.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.922
This thing is an
absolute beast.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.625
Lot of work involved,
but if you do the work,

21:00.660 --> 21:03.461
you don't have to buy
store-bought lumber.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.464
I spent my whole life
working, working, working,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.100
and we're just
programmed to desire

21:09.135 --> 21:12.370
all these things that we
know we can't afford.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.106
That's unsustainable
for the human spirit.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.808
So, if I have to do a little
physical labor, big deal.

21:17.844 --> 21:22.179
It is liberating, not feeding
all these greedy systems.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.950
All right. First cut.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.388
Beautiful piece right there.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.490
I'll make a nice
bench out of that.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.993
All that brush seemed
like an impenetrable
barrier in the moment,

21:36.029 --> 21:37.728
but after doing
a little bit of work,

21:37.764 --> 21:39.563
I've got a nice
load of firewood,

21:39.599 --> 21:41.632
and I'll have slabs.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.335
It ended up turning
into an amazing situation,

21:44.370 --> 21:46.704
where a barrier
became an asset.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.875
But right now, the winds are
picking up something fierce.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.244
I wanna get this done
and get outta here.

22:03.389 --> 22:06.490
KALEB: Living out here, I have
to go out in the woods and

22:06.526 --> 22:08.559
harvest the meat,
process the meat,

22:08.594 --> 22:10.861
and then, I have
to preserve it.

22:10.897 --> 22:14.231
Whatever method is used,
I personally have to do.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.273
These tracks are
all old, Ellie.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.308
Check out all those
tracks over there, okay?

22:25.912 --> 22:28.479
I'm heading out into the
mountains to hunt ptarmigan,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.548
and I get to go teach my
daughter a little bit about

22:30.583 --> 22:33.317
hunting wild game.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.020
Stand up.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.922
You're doing great, Ellie.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.025
Ptarmigan are a
small grouse species.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.127
They usually live up
in the high country.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.595
They turn white
in the wintertime,

22:44.630 --> 22:46.630
so they're
extremely hard to see.

22:46.666 --> 22:50.301
Usually the only reason
you see them is by
looking for shapes.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.436
You have to learn the
shape of a ptarmigan,

22:52.472 --> 22:54.905
and if you can learn that,
you can find them.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.540
Look at these
ptarmigan tracks!

22:56.576 --> 22:58.876
These are kind of old, though.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.244
ELOVIE: How?

23:00.279 --> 23:01.879
KALEB: See how they look like
there's a little bit of snow

23:01.914 --> 23:03.414
in the bottom of them?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.149
It snowed two days ago.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.318
So these ptarmigan were up
here when it was snowing.

23:07.353 --> 23:10.721
And they've flown
off somewhere else.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.525
We need to go find some
more tracks somewhere else.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.894
Where maybe they've been
a little bit sooner.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.430
All right, let's go.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.277
Wow, Ellie.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.946
ELOVIE: Dad,
what are you doing?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.048
KALEB: Need to get
my binoculars out.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.618
ELOVIE: Can I help you also?

23:44.524 --> 23:47.391
KALEB: Look at that!
ELOVIE: Whoa.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.204
ELOVIE: Yeah.
KALEB: Through the binoculars?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.472
ELOVIE: Yup.

24:02.809 --> 24:03.808
KALEB: Yup.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.678
KALEB: Elovie just loved
seeing the moose today.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.146
They're just
wintering up there.

24:09.182 --> 24:10.881
They're way up in
the high country.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.018
And they'll stay up there until
the snow starts to get deep,

24:14.053 --> 24:16.353
and it pushes them
down the mountain.

24:16.389 --> 24:19.056
Ellie, it's pretty cool seeing
stuff move around up here.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.858
We've seen old
ptarmigan tracks.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.894
But so far, we're
not really seeing any,

24:23.930 --> 24:26.430
anything fresh
for ptarmigan, so.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.870
KALEB: Yeah, we
can't do that right now.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.405
ELOVIE: When?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.040
KALEB: I know, it's
pretty exciting seeing the
moose, though, isn't it?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.277
KALEB: We can shoot
the moose in September.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.647
KALEB: Oh, it's not sad.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.083
There's a reason
for hunting seasons.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.486
If you just went and killed
all the animals because you

24:48.521 --> 24:51.355
could hunt year-round then
there'd be nothing left,

24:51.390 --> 24:55.493
and we wouldn't be able to use
that resource in the future.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.028
Today was a good opportunity to
teach my daughter a little bit

24:58.064 --> 25:01.732
about conservation,
and we have to be
responsible stewards.

25:02.768 --> 25:05.703
And always remember that if we
want this to be here tomorrow,

25:05.738 --> 25:08.672
we need to be very careful
about our actions today.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.508
Check out the moose scat.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.543
ELOVIE: That is poop.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.011
KALEB: It's been
here a couple days.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.379
You think it's the
same moose we just saw?

25:15.414 --> 25:16.447
ELOVIE: Uh-huh.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.781
KALEB: Yeah, I bet so, too.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.884
It looks like he's been
living on the hillside
here for a few days.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.285
ELOVIE: Maybe.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.320
KALEB: I saw all sorts
of beds on the road.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.056
I think he's just
hangin' out up here,

25:26.092 --> 25:27.191
enjoying the view.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.292
What do you think?

25:28.327 --> 25:30.094
ELOVIE: Yeah.
KALEB: It's pretty gorgeous.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.731
ELOVIE: Uh-huh.
KALEB: Well.

25:33.766 --> 25:37.067
So, it might be time to
head down the mountain and
get our alder firewood.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.236
Ready to go do that?

25:39.272 --> 25:40.538
ELOVIE: Yeah.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.740
KALEB: All right. Let's go.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.643
We might not have been
successful with our
little ptarmigan hunt,

25:45.678 --> 25:50.214
which really depends on your
definition of success.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.815
I would consider it
success because I had a

25:51.851 --> 25:55.252
great afternoon with my
daughter in the mountains.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.863
Just sit there and watch
while I get some alders,

26:05.898 --> 26:06.997
and you will cool off.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.132
'Kay?

26:08.167 --> 26:11.402
Fortunately, we plan ahead,
and we have meat in the

26:11.437 --> 26:14.138
freezer from our
last hunting season,

26:14.173 --> 26:16.006
that we can call upon
to put in the smoker,

26:16.042 --> 26:18.809
instead of what we
attempted to harvest today.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.079
All right, Ellie, think that's
enough to smoke some meat?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.280
ELOVIE: Let's, let's boogie!

26:23.316 --> 26:26.116
KALEB: Let's boogie!

26:27.486 --> 26:29.119
Apparently,
you're ready to go.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.922
ELOVIE: Let's go!
KALEB: Let's go.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.603
MICHAEL: This is a
hard environment.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.438
The darkness, the cold.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.974
I don't try to play
tough guy in Alaska.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.580
All right.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.916
The winds have died down.
The sun's peeking out.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.284
It's nice and cold.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.120
It's a good time to
move some heavy stuff.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.095
This was originally a
big tangled mess over
my five-mile loop.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.063
But in the end, after
all that hard work,

27:13.099 --> 27:16.367
I'm gonna come out of
here with a bunch of lumber,

27:16.402 --> 27:18.469
and some firewood.

27:18.504 --> 27:22.706
And so now, I'm gonna
take my time and haul
one piece at a time.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.242
(barking).

27:25.277 --> 27:26.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:26.579 --> 27:28.812
These dogs don't
give me much time to
do anything, really.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.315
They're just knuckleheads
this time of the year.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.051
Hey! Line up!
Come on! Line up!

27:34.086 --> 27:35.786
Super hardheaded breed.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.188
Hard workers and
hardheaded as well.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.691
You stay lined up.

27:40.726 --> 27:44.028
You ready? Go get 'em! Go!

27:44.063 --> 27:47.564
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Slow down.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.601
This is actually the
first time that I've hauled a

27:50.636 --> 27:54.304
16-foot slab with this
sled, and it works perfectly.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.473
If I get about
three more dogs,

27:56.509 --> 27:58.909
I could probably just
load the entire sled up.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.111
But for right now, we need
these dogs to get in shape

28:01.147 --> 28:03.847
before I really start puttin'
the miles and weight on 'em.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.450
But this is just
early season training,

28:06.485 --> 28:09.586
and they're already
getting work done.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.024
Whoa!

28:14.060 --> 28:16.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:16.295 --> 28:18.062
Whoa!

28:18.097 --> 28:19.997
Good dogs.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.266
I wouldn't have been able to
move that by myself without

28:22.301 --> 28:24.501
straining my back.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.604
And so, what you're seeing
here is a traditional way to

28:27.640 --> 28:29.039
move stuff around.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.542
Goods and supplies,
freight, lumber, firewood.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.010
You name it.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.480
All you gotta do is just
fire up a few malamutes.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.851
All right.
Time to go with another team.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.754
Straight ahead!
Straight ahead!

28:43.789 --> 28:45.355
Straight ahead!

28:45.391 --> 28:46.924
The training regimen
in the winter time,

28:46.959 --> 28:49.760
it starts the second
that snow hits the ground.

28:49.795 --> 28:54.264
Haw! Haw!
Good boys.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.834
This is the best time
of the year in Alaska.

28:58.537 --> 29:02.973
It's cold, it's brutal, and
these dogs motivate you to

29:03.008 --> 29:05.209
get out here, get
the blood pumpin'.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.113
They really do help me cope
with the dark and the cold.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.115
I can't sit around idle.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.051
They have to work.
It's their season.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.793
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:22.828 --> 29:26.663
(barking).

29:28.200 --> 29:29.333
All right.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.335
Look at those slabs of wood.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.571
This color right here,
it's such a comforting color.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.741
It's this warm,
setting of the sun color,

29:37.777 --> 29:40.144
mixed in with wispy clouds.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.614
And so, with that setting sun,
I gotta keep movin',

29:43.649 --> 29:47.451
keep runnin', keep puttin'
them miles on them dogs.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.954
I got two in one shot,
bunch of wood and some
miles on my dogs.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.290
I'm gonna get one more run in.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.632
JOHNNY: Complacency is
what's gonna kill you.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.401
So out here, I
like to stay moving.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.303
I don't like to stop,
you know.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.638
There's so much to do.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.941
Just surviving alone will
take up most of your time.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.983
What you smell, Java? Huh?

30:20.019 --> 30:22.686
Oh, yeah. These are all
broken branches.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.325
This one's living too, so.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.896
There's, yeah, you can see
the bear's hair right here.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.200
Yeah.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.768
What he does is he
just comes over here,

30:37.803 --> 30:39.937
and he puts his
back against the tree,

30:39.972 --> 30:41.972
and just kind of
marks his territory,

30:42.007 --> 30:46.176
and any branches that
are in the way just break
or fall on the ground.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.979
It's a good day to be doing a,
a little bit of bear defense

30:49.014 --> 30:51.315
on the cabin, that's for sure.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.484
Come here, Java.
Hey! Come here.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.255
My goal today is to
make a latch for the
door for the cabin.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.427
The purpose of the latch is
to keep Java in the cabin

31:03.462 --> 31:05.329
when it's necessary.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.265
I rarely leave her in there
without myself being in there.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.369
But there are times usually
when there are bears or wolves

31:12.404 --> 31:14.905
roaming that, uh, it's, it's
kind of important to keep her

31:14.940 --> 31:18.208
in there for her own safety.

31:18.244 --> 31:23.981
So I got to find a, a little
spruce tree to cut down.

31:24.016 --> 31:27.684
And that's gonna be, uh,
what goes through the door.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.721
And, um, I'll have a
handle on each end of that.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.759
Let's see, let's see.

31:37.096 --> 31:40.731
God, that's such a, that's
a big (bleep) grizzly bear!

31:40.766 --> 31:42.366
Look at that.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.542
♪ ♪

31:52.578 --> 31:56.213
JOHNNY: God, that's
such a, that's a big
(bleep) grizzly bear!

31:57.016 --> 31:58.448
Look at that.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.284
You could see where
its nails, that's a big,

32:00.319 --> 32:02.352
that's a big paw.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.154
And that's the
right, right foot,

32:04.189 --> 32:06.490
and that's the
left foot there.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.326
And he's moving, he's
moving toward my camp.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.162
Makes you think.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.698
You know, I've been, I've
been waitin' so long for it to

32:14.733 --> 32:17.301
start snowing so I could see
all of the tracks and know

32:17.336 --> 32:19.236
what's hanging around my camp.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.704
It's a little bit more
than I thought it was,

32:20.739 --> 32:24.975
to be honest, so, um, yeah,
time to get to this latch

32:25.010 --> 32:27.844
before, before
that sun goes down.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.115
Just gotta find about a one,
one-and-a-half-inch diameter,

32:32.184 --> 32:35.986
uh, little spruce tree.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.589
It'll act as the, the
piece that goes in the door.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.292
This one here might work.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.364
I really enjoy
working with my hands.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.933
To, to have a thought, and
to put it down on paper,

32:49.969 --> 32:52.536
and then, take it from
paper, and to apply it,

32:52.571 --> 32:55.172
and actually build it,
is very, very satisfying.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.140
So the plan for the
latch is to take,

32:57.176 --> 33:01.912
uh, two pieces, put 'em up.

33:04.984 --> 33:08.385
Spruce, I'm gonna
have to whittle down.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.554
Probably about 50%.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.890
And that's gonna slide
in and out of that
little box that I make.

33:13.926 --> 33:16.760
And I'll have a hole in the
side of this doorjamb that

33:16.795 --> 33:19.363
this will go into.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.733
Little handle, and
it'll slide in and out.

33:25.104 --> 33:29.673
You know, I think people tend
to go toward other humans when

33:29.708 --> 33:31.942
they wanna feel
like they belong.

33:31.977 --> 33:35.679
But I don't need people
out here to feel like
I belong to something.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.381
I feel like I
belong to this, uh,

33:37.416 --> 33:39.750
this ecosystem,
this environment,

33:39.785 --> 33:41.018
and all the animals.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.285
Nature.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.621
You know, having the bear that
comes around here at night,

33:44.656 --> 33:46.957
I'm a part of that
bear's life now,

33:46.992 --> 33:49.259
and it's kind of
become a part of me.

33:49.294 --> 33:50.861
We have this
weird relationship.

33:50.896 --> 33:54.097
You know, whose, whose
turf is it at what time?

33:54.132 --> 33:57.567
It's like a, a weird respect.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.903
But also, you can't let your
guard down either because

33:59.938 --> 34:02.105
that bear will
capitalize on, you know,

34:02.141 --> 34:04.141
taking my food.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.110
Possibly even turning me into
a meal or definitely Java.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.682
Let's give it the test.

34:12.718 --> 34:13.683
Java, come here!

34:13.719 --> 34:16.620
Java, come on!
Java, come on!

34:16.655 --> 34:18.922
You hear her scratching.

34:18.957 --> 34:21.992
Looks like the, looks like
the latch is doing its job.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.727
I hold myself
accountable out here.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.262
It's up to me to
get things done.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.863
Yeah, I'm pretty
happy with it.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.533
Works pretty good.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.768
You have to know how
to apply yourself.

34:31.804 --> 34:35.472
You gotta be confident,
but you can't be arrogant
or cocky either.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.674
And kind of have the
wisdom to know the difference,

34:37.709 --> 34:40.143
or you won't make it.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.279
What do you say, Java?

34:42.314 --> 34:46.483
You wanna go walk out on
the lake or something?

34:46.518 --> 34:47.584
Come on!

34:47.619 --> 34:48.919
Let's go walk out on the ice.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.421
Hmm? Come on!

34:59.531 --> 35:01.798
ALEX: A challenge comes,
I just face it.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.667
I just do my best.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.802
You know, I'm still here.
I'm still alive.

35:05.838 --> 35:08.805
Nobody can say I'm a
failure until I'm dead.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.585
It's a really
good thing I, uh,

35:21.620 --> 35:24.488
took my chimney down now
because all this creosote

35:24.523 --> 35:27.124
inside, if that
gets hot enough,

35:27.159 --> 35:28.625
it'll set on fire.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.861
I can see that there is, uh,
a bit of heat damage in here.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.296
So that's, uh, a
major warning sign.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.098
If it kept going on like that,
there would definitely have

35:35.134 --> 35:36.733
been a fire at some point.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.302
So, it's a good thing
I'm replacing this.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.972
You little son of a bitch.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.307
All this work I have to
do, everything's kind of

35:44.343 --> 35:46.877
conspiring against me to, to
make this job more dangerous

35:46.912 --> 35:48.712
than it has to be.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.515
You know, trying to lift and
haul heavy awkward things

35:51.550 --> 35:53.750
on a steep roof.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.685
I'm using sharp power tools.

35:55.721 --> 35:59.089
And I'm also
working in the dark.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.360
Okay. There you go.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.995
I can see the light at
the end of the tunnel.

36:05.030 --> 36:08.231
The final step is to get this
eight-foot length stove pipe.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.800
Lift this heavy
thing up, and then,

36:10.836 --> 36:13.336
carefully guide it
into the flashing,

36:13.372 --> 36:16.106
so that it rests on the
stovepipe underneath.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.947
Come on.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.983
It wants to tip either way.

36:27.019 --> 36:30.620
How do I prevent
it from doing that?

36:30.656 --> 36:33.590
Uh, once I get, I can get
it to here, that's fine.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.793
It starts to want sliding,
to slide either way.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.228
I just don't
want it to do that,

36:38.263 --> 36:39.596
because I don't,
I, it's too heavy,

36:39.631 --> 36:43.867
I won't be able to just
easily get the control of it.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.406
It's just I don't have any
control over the upper end,

36:49.441 --> 36:52.342
even, even up like this.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.311
If I drop this
thing, if it falls,

36:54.346 --> 36:55.879
it may be ruined.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.883
Adjust my body, see if I
can find the right spot.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.391
I'm not sure if it's on it.

37:08.427 --> 37:12.729
That's got so much
(bleep) sway to it.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.798
And it doesn't hold itself.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.900
(bleep).

37:16.935 --> 37:19.135
And I can't get it off.

37:19.171 --> 37:23.240
(groaning).

37:23.275 --> 37:24.574
I can't get it off.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.176
But now the issue is,
well, the stovepipe's stuck.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.944
It's stuck in the flashing.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.212
I can't leave it
here because if I do,

37:29.248 --> 37:30.513
it's gonna fall over.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.715
It's gonna bend all the metal,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.016
it's gonna tear my
whole chimney up.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.684
It's pretty heavy.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.419
Uh, it's also slick.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.755
Maintaining my balance for
myself and of this pipe is

37:38.790 --> 37:39.923
really difficult.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.124
I'm extremely angry.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.826
Just, uh, you know, a lot
of, it's a lot of stress

37:42.861 --> 37:44.828
compounding, so,
uh, I'm just gonna,

37:44.863 --> 37:48.131
I'm just gonna
let some of it out.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.633
I don't care if I'll die.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.701
If I fall, I fall.
That's it.

37:51.703 --> 37:56.373
(groaning).

37:56.408 --> 37:58.475
You (bleep) big heavy (bleep).

38:07.319 --> 38:08.952
(bleep).

38:08.987 --> 38:11.421
You (bleep) big heavy (bleep).

38:13.292 --> 38:15.458
When I hit a road
block, I get angry.

38:15.494 --> 38:16.626
I get mad.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.662
Uh, and I just let it
all out right on the spot.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.563
It helps me kind of
get through it quicker.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.633
(bleep).

38:23.669 --> 38:25.669
Once I kind of get
that bad energy out,

38:25.704 --> 38:27.937
then it helps me
have a level head,

38:27.973 --> 38:29.205
so I can think.

38:29.241 --> 38:30.640
Okay, yeah, I'm stuck.

38:30.676 --> 38:31.908
What do I need to do?

38:31.943 --> 38:34.311
I think I can go inside, and I
can actually feed the chimney

38:34.346 --> 38:36.546
from below, up, up.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.815
Rather than trying to do it
this way because this thing's

38:38.850 --> 38:40.216
just too heavy.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.384
I got no way to handle it.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.320
I can't get it to sit
on there correctly.

38:43.355 --> 38:46.089
So it's, um, I just
can't do it like this.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.858
Time for Plan B.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.295
It's never (bleep)
over 'til it's over.

38:54.766 --> 38:58.835
Okay. All right.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.504
Okay, now get the box off.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.808
Oh, yeah.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.211
Uh, I don't know what the
temperature is right now,

39:08.246 --> 39:11.915
just my, uh, anger
and frustration that's
keeping me warm.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.751
I was just
trying to work fast.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.353
It's getting a lot colder.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.788
That's just gonna make
all this work that
much more difficult.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.957
Yeah, and on top of that, is I
don't want my water to freeze,

39:20.992 --> 39:22.459
I don't want my
food to freeze.

39:22.494 --> 39:25.528
So I need to get this
done fast and efficient.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.163
But this is also my chimney.

39:27.199 --> 39:30.233
And this time, I wanna make
it safe and make one that will

39:30.268 --> 39:32.769
last for a lifetime.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.838
All right.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.874
Um, now I can make a fire.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.743
So, that's done.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.312
Well, that was a
really long day.

39:42.347 --> 39:46.649
It's over now, now,
now, now I got my stove.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.722
MICHAEL: When I
look at these dogs,

39:52.758 --> 39:55.091
they help me get
through the winter of Alaska.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.360
They reinvigorate my spirit.

39:57.396 --> 40:00.296
I find running and working
with these animals just as

40:00.332 --> 40:03.833
therapeutic as it is for the
animals running the miles.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.206
Come here, Mow-Mow.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.143
Right here, we got a
little bit of strong brew.

40:14.312 --> 40:18.715
So every day, there is moose
stew sittin' on the dutch oven.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.352
I dump that juice
into the dogs' water.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.853
So I bait their water.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.990
Trying to get dogs to hydrate,
you gotta trick 'em sometimes.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.626
Oh, you want some boost juice?

40:29.661 --> 40:32.028
Oh, you've been
working hard, buddy.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.330
For working animals
that endure the cold,

40:34.366 --> 40:36.466
it's a lot of upkeep.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.168
You know, I'm the coach,
I'm the mentor,

40:38.203 --> 40:39.769
I'm the leader.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.172
I'm everything to these dogs,
and they've known me since

40:42.207 --> 40:44.407
their eyes first opened.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.409
You give one of
these malamutes a job,

40:46.445 --> 40:47.811
it perks 'em up.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.646
It's what they
thrive and live for.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.848
They wanna work hard.
They're really smart.

40:51.883 --> 40:56.352
And so, it is an honor to work
with this indigenous breed for

40:56.388 --> 40:59.189
which the people of the
northwest Arctic of Alaska

40:59.224 --> 41:02.592
sculpted for
hundreds of generations.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.595
Everybody like
that strong brew?

41:05.630 --> 41:08.298
You better drink it up because
we're gonna keep runnin'.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.034
Can I get an,
"Oh, howl, yeah"?

41:11.069 --> 41:12.635
Awoo!

41:12.671 --> 41:18.675
(howling).

41:22.981 --> 41:25.582
BRITTANY: To raise a
family here in rural Alaska,

41:25.617 --> 41:28.651
it takes a lot of planning,
it takes a lot of willingness,

41:28.687 --> 41:31.688
and you can't half-heart
do anything out here.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.292
KALEB: This thing
is working great.

41:36.328 --> 41:37.827
BRITTANY: Your
little smokehouse?

41:37.863 --> 41:39.229
Moment of truth.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.430
GILBERT: Yummy.

41:40.465 --> 41:43.366
BRITTANY: Kaleb and I have
never been what someone might

41:43.401 --> 41:47.537
call traditional, including
the way we have outdoor meals.

41:47.572 --> 41:51.140
We use an ATV for
our dining room table.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.444
It's a lot of fun in
the non-traditional way.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.312
KALEB: Who wants
the other wing?

41:56.348 --> 41:58.448
ELOVIE: Me!
GILBERT: I do.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.317
BRITTANY: I think there's
nothing better than being by a

42:01.353 --> 42:03.520
bonfire, and having
the stars overhead,

42:03.555 --> 42:05.321
and being with my family.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.656
KALEB: Did you work up
an appetite, Ellie,

42:06.691 --> 42:08.324
going out on
the ptarmigan hunt?

42:08.360 --> 42:10.393
ELOVIE: I did.

42:10.428 --> 42:11.895
KALEB: We might not
have gotten a ptarmigan,

42:11.930 --> 42:14.130
but this is a
good alternative.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.432
Getting to spend the evening
with my family around the

42:16.468 --> 42:18.568
fire is awesome.

42:18.603 --> 42:21.304
And I think that the
smoker is a huge success,

42:21.339 --> 42:23.206
and I'm looking
forward to smoking many,

42:23.241 --> 42:25.008
many other meats
in the future.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.843
BRITTANY: Isn't
this skin so good?

42:26.878 --> 42:27.911
GILBERT: Uh-hmm.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.312
KALEB: Oh, man,
it worked great.

42:29.347 --> 42:31.814
BRITTANY: I'd say that
sometimes the simplest
things are the best.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.416
KALEB: Uh-hmm.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.118
BRITTANY: Are we gonna
eat this whole chicken?

42:35.153 --> 42:38.021
KALEB: Probably.
ELOVIE: Probably.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.294
ALEX: Ooh, look at that.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.763
Yeah, that sap in there,
that'll burn nice and hot.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.798
Puttin' my stove
back together,

42:48.833 --> 42:51.868
making a fire and warming up,
is a moment to savor.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.536
There we go.

42:53.572 --> 42:55.738
Now we're home free.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.141
For me, my woodstove
is like my, my shrine.

42:58.176 --> 43:00.810
When it's cold outside,
I go before my woodstove,

43:00.845 --> 43:04.047
and that's where I,
I have my prayers, right?

43:04.082 --> 43:06.482
Maybe humans have just been
like kind of living with fire

43:06.518 --> 43:09.285
for so many millions of years,
that it's just kind of in our

43:09.321 --> 43:12.322
DNA to, uh, to kind of
revere it or something.

43:12.357 --> 43:14.591
So that's one of the
reasons I came out here.

43:14.626 --> 43:16.793
I wanted to just live
by instincts, you know?

43:16.828 --> 43:19.128
I like kind of
rejecting society,

43:19.164 --> 43:21.864
and, and just going back
to kind of being an animal.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.800
You know, maybe at
some point in the future,

43:23.835 --> 43:25.935
I'll return to society.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.337
I don't really
see that happening,

43:27.372 --> 43:30.139
but at least now I know kind
of a little bit of the

43:30.175 --> 43:32.976
other way to live.

43:44.756 --> 43:46.923
JOHNNY: You want
some of the tea?

43:46.958 --> 43:48.291
The only thing I
answer out here,

43:48.326 --> 43:50.627
Mother Nature and Java.

43:50.662 --> 43:54.364
One of the toughest things at
being isolated is battling the

43:54.399 --> 43:56.699
"What ifs" in my mind.

43:56.735 --> 43:58.267
I'm facing
negative temperatures.

43:58.303 --> 44:00.169
I'm facing
animals that, you know,

44:00.205 --> 44:02.372
wanna maybe take
me or my dog out.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.140
And suddenly, you see a
bear out your window.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.310
That'll stir you up real good.

44:07.345 --> 44:11.280
I have no idea what's
gonna happen every day.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.716
It's very unpredictable.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.952
I wouldn't change
it for the world.
