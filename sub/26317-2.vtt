00:01.697 --> 00:03.655
Previously onSWAT...We got any word on Street?

00:03.699 --> 00:05.179
I tried his cell three times,
but he's not picking up.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.789
You probably already know,
but I lied.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.357
You're off SWAT. You report
to patrol duty tomorrow.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.402
We hold each other's lives
out there,

00:11.446 --> 00:13.404
and I need to see
that Street gets that.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.364
Nia Wells.Daniel Harrelson. They
call me Hondo though.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.888
You're a prosecutor, huh? NIA: Deputy D.A.

00:18.931 --> 00:22.239
NURSE: How long you two been married? Actually, getting divorced.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.198
It's funny, you know, when
something like this happens,

00:24.241 --> 00:26.200
it changes how you
look at things.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.375
LEROY: My son Darryl,
he's in trouble,

00:27.418 --> 00:29.681
and I can't get through
to the boy.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.031
Darryl's more like you, man.
He's a thinker.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.381
But he got
other options in life.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.947
Your auntie up north,
she'd be willing to let you

00:34.991 --> 00:36.297
go stay with her for a while.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.690
WOMAN:
Ela?

01:27.391 --> 01:29.263

01:36.139 --> 01:38.185
[quietly]:
It's okay.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.194
I got a peek inside.
Two guys armed with shotguns.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.456
Adam 13, requesting backup.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.371
I have two suspects
armed with shotguns.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.807
We got to go in.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.243
No. More officers
are on the way.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.375
[whispers]:
This girl needs our help.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.419
Right now.

Standard procedure.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.181
[whispers]:
Hey. Come here.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.488
Come here. Come here,
honey. Come on.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.533
Come with me. Come
with me. It's okay.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.708
That's it.

02:23.752 --> 02:24.796
Come on.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.675
HONDO:
The call came

02:33.718 --> 02:34.937
from Adam 13.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.417
That's Street and his partner.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.031
All right, we're almost there.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.164
All right, you know

04:27.354 --> 04:29.094
They called in
their own backup,

04:29.138 --> 04:31.009
moved in formation,
and tactical shooting.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.316
And they got a bulletproof SUV.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.666
Who the hell are
these guys?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.712
♪

05:13.356 --> 05:15.402
That bulletproof SUV was found
abandoned two miles from here.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.446
I got unis
searching every inch

05:16.490 --> 05:19.144
of Pico-Union
for these guys.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.364
D.A. thinks they know
who they are. Agent Floyd?

05:21.408 --> 05:23.018
We found heroin and guns
inside the house.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
It's a stash spot.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.629
The duffel bag
they retrieved

05:25.673 --> 05:26.761
probably contained
drug proceeds.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.806
From everything you described,

05:28.850 --> 05:30.155
this crew has to be the Omegas.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.636
The rumor is the Omegas were
trained by the DEA

05:32.680 --> 05:35.596
to hunt drug cartels in Turkey
before becoming one themselves.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.597
Unfortunately,
the rumors are true.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.989
The Omegas'
military discipline

05:38.033 --> 05:40.122
makes them well-organized
and dangerous.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.253
Yeah, we just got
a taste of that,

05:41.297 --> 05:42.342
but I'm looking forward
to round two.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.605
They're led by Cano Ozdemir,

05:44.648 --> 05:47.434
who goes by his call sign,
Omega One.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.131
He normally operates
out of Turkey.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.133
If his crew's here in L.A.
looking to stay under the radar,

05:51.176 --> 05:53.048
then he's definitely
up to something.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.442
Witnesses saw a woman and young
boy flee before we arrived.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
Patrol's still looking
for the car they were in,

05:56.834 --> 05:58.488
but here's a photo
of them.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.533
CHRIS: Probably the mother
and the brother

05:59.576 --> 06:00.969
of the little girl
Street found.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.840
Unfortunately, she's not
saying much. Too terrified.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.147
HONDO: That mother was forced
to leave her daughter behind,

06:05.190 --> 06:06.278
so if she's still out there
with her son,

06:06.322 --> 06:07.236
then they're both targets
right now.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.280
Maybe we should start

06:08.324 --> 06:10.108
with the enemy of our enemy.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.023
The Omegas' main heroin rival
is the Baja Diablo Cartel.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.634
We could talk to
them, find out

06:13.677 --> 06:15.244
if this mother and son
are connected to them.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.985
The Baja Diablos aren't
gonna talk to the police,

06:17.028 --> 06:18.116
even if it's
about the Omegas,

06:18.160 --> 06:19.509
unless we've got
some type of leverage.

06:19.553 --> 06:20.641
Let's get a search warrant.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.990
Find some dope
at one of their places.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.295
See if we can loosen
their tongues that way.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.123
I'll go to court,
find a friendly judge.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.821
Tan, you roll with Beni.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.258
All right, no way the Omegas
shipped a bulletproof

06:29.301 --> 06:31.782
monster like that across
the Atlantic through customs.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.350
But I know a local guy
does high-end work
like this on trucks.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.004
That sounds like a solid lead.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.919
Chris and I will go with you.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.878
What do you want to do
about the girl?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.140
I've already called
Social Services,

06:42.184 --> 06:44.012
but they're shorthanded
at the moment.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.753
I got an idea.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.888
Street.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.546
Heard the Omegas
might be behind this.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.374
They might be going after
that girl's family.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.464
She seems to have
a connection with you.You want me to talk to her?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.466
See if she can
give us anything?

07:03.510 --> 07:06.904
Sure. I'll let you know.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.826
You see that car
at one o'clock?

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
Driver's been watching
us the whole time.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.699
Omega lookout?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.831
I wouldn't put it
past 'em.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.443
I'm contact,
you're cover.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.881
Excuse me.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.013
Commander Bob Hicks, LAPD.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.059
Could I see some I.D., please?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.455
Gun! Let me see hands.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.022
Let me see hands!

07:38.066 --> 07:39.894
With your right hand,
unlock the door

07:39.937 --> 07:41.112
and exit the vehicle.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.685
Hands on top of the car.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.735
Jessica Cortez.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.040
Kamile Erkan.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.347
Please tell these people
who I am.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.870
Kamile is an Interpol
officer from Turkey.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.917
Consulted on a few cases
I worked in Hollenbeck.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.049
Interpol doesn't have
jurisdiction in the States.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.704
They also can't carry
service weapons here.

08:07.748 --> 08:08.836
So we'll hang onto this
for now.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.967
What are you doing in L.A.?

08:10.011 --> 08:12.883
Same thing as you.
Hunting Omegas.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.060
The mother on the run,
her name is Jubilee.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.497
Her son is Rudi.

08:19.411 --> 08:20.935
If you want to find them
before the Omegas do,

08:20.978 --> 08:23.415
you should listen to
what I have to say.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.551
You want to tell us your name?

08:35.602 --> 08:36.559
I'll be back.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.782
How's it going with the girl?

08:41.825 --> 08:44.480
Well, she's not showing
any signs of physical abuse,

08:44.524 --> 08:45.960
but she's still not
saying anything.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.745
Have you tried speaking
to her in Turkish?

08:48.789 --> 08:50.268
I will.Mm-hmm.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.922
As soon as I learn Turkish.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.925
Well, you should get creative
and use your dictionary

08:54.969 --> 08:56.013
or your translator
on your phone.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.015
You're good with kids.

08:58.059 --> 09:01.236
There's a real-life translator
showing up any minute.

09:01.279 --> 09:04.761
She obviously sees
something in you she trusts.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.633
You got to speak
her language.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.287
Maybe literally.
Yeah.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.028
Oh, one more thing.
I, um...

09:11.072 --> 09:12.073
I talked to Hondo.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.988
Why?

09:14.031 --> 09:15.119
Because you won't
do it yourself,

09:15.163 --> 09:17.252
and I know you want
to be back on SWAT.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.515
If I'm wrong,
then tell me.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.041
The door's still open
for now.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.130
But you got to show him
how far you've come.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.612
Thanks.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.833
[Street sighs]

09:34.312 --> 09:36.532
[quietly]:
Try something.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.192
Jim Street.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.337
FLOYD:
She won't tell us
what she knows

09:59.381 --> 10:02.166
until she gets a guarantee
from the D.A.'s office

10:02.210 --> 10:03.907
she won't be facing
gun charges.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.300
I made some calls to Interpol,

10:05.343 --> 10:07.041
and according to
Kamile's superiors,

10:07.084 --> 10:09.391
she's been M.I.A.
for the past seven weeks.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.827
When I worked with Kamile
in Hollenbeck,

10:10.871 --> 10:12.786
she was dedicated
to her job.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.136
Sometimes too much so.Well, apparently,

10:15.179 --> 10:16.311
they had to get
her counseling.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.705
She was on the verge
of washing out.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.795
FLOYD: She could be an asset,
but can we trust her?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.187
You know her.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.101
I'm not sure
we can trust her,

10:24.145 --> 10:25.929
but I've seen Kamile work.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.105
And if she's got information
that can help us,

10:28.149 --> 10:29.977
maybe we can save
Jubilee and her son.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.893
It's your call, Cortez.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.339
Every second I'm here,
the Omegas get closer

10:44.382 --> 10:46.384
to finding Jubilee
and her son before you do.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.734
You're free to go.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.126
The D.A. won't charge
you for the gun.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.258
Tell us where to find him.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.825
Let me speak with Ela first.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.001
I can't do that.
Ela's in our custody.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.350
We are all police here.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.699
Are we?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.266
You're M.I.A. from Interpol.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.876
Feels like you're doing this
on your own.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.095
In Turkey,

11:01.138 --> 11:03.097
some police still belong
to the drug crews.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.446
I have to make moves.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.708
And when you're a woman,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
they call you crazy for that.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.364
I'm sure you understand.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.889
You don't trust me.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.152
But why should I trust you?

11:15.196 --> 11:18.852
It was U.S. law enforcement
that created the Omegas.

11:18.895 --> 11:22.333
If we can't fight
them together...

11:22.377 --> 11:25.162
then I will just keep
doing it on my own.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.905
How's your life?

11:28.949 --> 11:31.125
You still close
with your sister?

11:33.127 --> 11:35.433
No.

11:37.174 --> 11:40.003
I had a relationship
that was very special to me.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.309
Didn't last.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.789
I've also been meaning

11:42.832 --> 11:44.921
to spend more time
with my niece.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.923
We used to talk about this.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.620
To do this job well,

11:48.664 --> 11:51.014
you must put
everything into it.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.102
But to put everything into it,

11:52.146 --> 11:53.800
how much of yourself
do you lose?

11:55.453 --> 11:58.413
My sister, Oba, said
I was too obsessed with work.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.067
She was right.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.591
That's how I lost her.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.245
The sacrifices we make,

12:04.288 --> 12:06.116
let's make them count.

12:09.337 --> 12:12.296
I followed the Omegas
from Istanbul.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.474
Most of the time,
they're efficient,

12:16.518 --> 12:17.867
business-minded.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.521
But that changed recently.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.263
Their failure and exposure
at the stash spot shows that.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.788
It's also the reason
their boss,

12:25.832 --> 12:27.268
Omega One, himself,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.139
has come to Los Angeles.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.491
JESSICA:
For Omega One to come here

12:33.535 --> 12:35.624
and risk a fight
with the LAPD means

12:35.667 --> 12:37.104
the situation
is personal for him.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.322
KAMILE:
He is not leaving

12:38.366 --> 12:40.281
until he finds Jubilee
and his children.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.456
JESSICA:
Wait a minute.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.415
Rudi and Ela are his kids?

12:44.459 --> 12:46.200
This is a custody battle.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.247
Hey, Luca, you said
your apartment was red-tagged

12:50.291 --> 12:51.640
from the earthquake damage,
right?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.424
Yeah, got a lot
of broken gas pipes,

12:53.468 --> 12:54.904
cracks in my walls.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.384
Just when I found
a place I like,

12:56.427 --> 12:57.646
poor Duke and
I got to move.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.300
Well, Annie and I
were looking at this place,

12:59.343 --> 13:01.389
but it might be better suited
for you. It's a dollar house.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.130
A dollar house in L.A.?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.001
It doesn't actually cost
a dollar, but it's

13:05.045 --> 13:07.177
available for about a quarter
of what it's really worth.This that thing

13:07.221 --> 13:09.353
where, uh, Housing and
Urban Development offer homes

13:09.397 --> 13:12.052
in at-risk neighborhoods
to police officers on the cheap?

13:12.095 --> 13:13.444
Oh, yeah, it's
supposed to build bonds

13:13.488 --> 13:15.577
between the cops and
the neighborhoods, right?

13:15.620 --> 13:18.058
LUCA: Right, yeah.
Didn't exactly catch
on in my dad's day.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.538
Yeah, but Captain Cortez's
proposals have brought it back.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.019
Always thought I'd wait till
I got married to buy a home.

13:23.063 --> 13:26.283
But... moving from
apartment to apartment--

13:26.327 --> 13:28.198
might be time to
get my own place.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.243
All right,
just send me the listing.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.679
I'll take a look later.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.246
Place is right here.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.292
This guy will modify anything
you want in bulletproof glass.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.946
His name is Casino Gangster.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.253
Hey, don't look
at me like that.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.429
It's the actual name
on his birth certificate.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.868
[gunshot]

13:45.912 --> 13:48.218
That's a Desert Eagle.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.785
It doesn't even penetrate
the first layer.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.787
My bulletproof glass
is guaranteed for two years

13:51.831 --> 13:54.007
or one shooting--
whichever comes first.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.139
Any of this legal,
Mr. Gangster?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.228
The business is fully licensed.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.274
Yeah, some of your
clients, not so much.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.971
[scoffs]
All right, Chastity,

14:02.015 --> 14:03.364
you're up.Hey, hey.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.670
Seriously?
You test bulletproof glass

14:05.714 --> 14:07.324
by shooting at women in bikinis?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.892
Well, they're perfectly safe.
That's the point.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.720
And they get paid per round.Well, maybe

14:11.763 --> 14:14.418
you should sit your butt
behind that glass in a Speedo.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.463
If the price is right,
sweetheart.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.421
Excuse me?

14:17.465 --> 14:18.509
All right, everyone out!

14:18.553 --> 14:20.250
Let's go, you guys.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.078
Take a hike.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.297
Thank you.

14:25.342 --> 14:28.824
Bulletproof SUVs driven
by Omegas. What do you know

14:28.868 --> 14:30.217
about 'em?Not a damn thing.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.435
Look, you want us

14:31.479 --> 14:32.741
to shut you down,
look into your customers,

14:32.784 --> 14:34.395
see what kind of dirt
you do business with?

14:34.438 --> 14:35.875
There's a woman named Jubilee
and her son Rudi.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.267
What do you know about them?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.704
I don't know anything
about a lady and her kid.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.010
Omegas...

14:41.054 --> 14:42.490
are great for business though.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.927
Orders skyrocketed,
'cause every dealer

14:44.971 --> 14:47.234
from Pico-Union to K-Town
is scared of whatever

14:47.277 --> 14:48.539
they're planning in L.A.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.412
[chuckles]
A few weeks ago,

14:51.455 --> 14:55.111
they ordered two cars customized
but only large-sized SUVs.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.460
Omegas...

14:56.504 --> 14:58.245
never make
transactions in person.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.724
They wouldn't even
allow me to be present

14:59.768 --> 15:01.248
when they picked up
the finished trucks.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.861
Give us the specs
you used on those trucks.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.299
I want to know what kind of gun
defeats your glass.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.736
Yo, Tan, Judge
Kumi's fast-tracking
our search warrant.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.956
Narcotics I.D.'d
a Baja Diablo drug house,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.479
and they got a few buys
over there.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.090
Once the warrant's ready,
I'm gonna send it to you

15:17.133 --> 15:18.526
and I'll meet you there.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.614
Yeah, good.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.485
That's all we could ask for.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.747
See you in five.
Mm-hmm.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.447
Nia.

15:26.490 --> 15:27.404
Hondo.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.232
Hey.Pickin' up a warrant?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.408
Yeah.
Thanks again
for your texts.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.367
I appreciate
you checking up on me.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.585
I see not even an earthquake
or a concussion

15:34.629 --> 15:35.543
can stop you
from doing your thing, huh?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.501
Fully recovered.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.156
They put me in that new hotel
up on Olympic.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.463
Now it's back to business
on my bribery case.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.334
Just taking a five while
the court reporter stretches

15:44.378 --> 15:48.948
her fingers after my key witness
just testified for two hours.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.253
Brave lady.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.342
She killed it
up on that stand.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.040
Defendant is so screwed.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.998
You know, it's amazing--
nothing makes a D.A. happier

15:56.042 --> 15:58.348
than sending people to jail.
[chuckles]

15:58.392 --> 16:00.350
People who deserve it?
Hell yeah.[chuckles]

16:00.394 --> 16:05.051
[chuckles] Don't tell me it's
not an aphrodisiac sometimes.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.357
[chuckles] Listen, you
should stop by court sometime,

16:07.401 --> 16:09.490
check out the trial
when you get a chance.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.404
Look, uh,

16:10.447 --> 16:12.275
I never said anything before.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.451
But I came to the
hospital to check on you

16:14.495 --> 16:15.887
when you were
still unconscious.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.846
Your husband was there.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.630
Ah, did you see
his girlfriend there, too?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.415
Blonde Amy?

16:21.458 --> 16:22.372
[chuckles]Eric likes

16:22.416 --> 16:24.461
to act protective.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.246
He's sentimental
that way.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.204
Divorce papers get signed
this month.[lock buzzes]

16:28.248 --> 16:30.424
GUARD: All right,
let's move it. This way.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.431
Somebody you put away?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.391
No, no.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.307
Somebody I tried to keep out.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.445
What up, Darryl?

16:51.488 --> 16:53.055
The sheriff told me

16:53.099 --> 16:54.665
you just got charged
with armed robbery.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.190
That you and two
of your boys jacked

16:57.233 --> 17:00.193
a convenience store at gunpoint
and I told them, "Nah, nah.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.586
There has to be
some type of mistake."

17:04.240 --> 17:06.329
Boy, you better look at me.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.511
New tat, new scars.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.471
When'd you get back into town?

17:17.514 --> 17:18.515
Six months ago.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.996
[sighs]

17:24.130 --> 17:26.610
I thought we had a deal.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.135
Darryl, you were
gonna live right

17:29.178 --> 17:31.441
if I sent you up north
to live with your Aunt Tanya.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.747
Aunt Tanya got sick.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.228
So I came to visit
my girl Heema for a week.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.578
But then she got pregnant,
so I had to come back full-time

17:37.621 --> 17:39.319
to take care
of the baby and her.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.407
And what type of job
you got that's gonna

17:40.450 --> 17:41.538
take care of
all of that, Darryl?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.541
Why didn't you just
ask me for help?!

17:44.585 --> 17:46.804
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.068
I do.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.852
But it ain't your place
to take care of me.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.595
Got to be my own man now.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.031
Darryl, you are 15.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.468
Same age my pops was
when he first went away.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.560
Does your pops
even know about this?

18:10.741 --> 18:13.309
I'm gonna keep
checking in on you.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.486
But this ain't
got to be your life.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.883
Don't it?

18:57.440 --> 18:58.659
What up, Leroy?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.922
How you feel, homie?I'm good.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.489
Thanks for meeting me.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.491
I figured you might be able
to give me some intel

19:04.534 --> 19:06.971
on the Omegas,
help me out with my case.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.496
I got no connection
to the Omegas and no skin

19:09.539 --> 19:13.064
in the heroin game,
but I stay up on things.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.501
What do you
want to know?

19:14.544 --> 19:16.285
We both know what happens
out there gets watched

19:16.329 --> 19:18.287
by people in here.
So I just wanted to see

19:18.331 --> 19:19.549
if your eyes and ears
picked up on anything

19:19.593 --> 19:20.768
that can help us.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.552
Food chain remains the same.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.815
Another day, same old beefs.

19:28.558 --> 19:33.520
But, uh, that ain't the only
reason you came here, is it?

19:34.695 --> 19:38.002
I know Darryl got
himself arrested.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.093
Don't make me a proud father.You talk to him yet?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.487
Boy thinks he can
handle things on his own.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.228
Sounds like I used to sound.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.535
[chuckles softly]But I plan on
talking to him soon.

19:48.578 --> 19:52.321
Leroy, he's still got a chance
to avoid doing serious time.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.975
If he plays it right.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.542
He can still
turn his life around.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.413
You think there's hope for him?

19:57.457 --> 19:58.806
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.243
But only if he's got
hope for himself.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.419
And you know you're the only one
who can reach him.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.029
I hear that.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.727
I haven't been around
most of Darryl's life.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.163
I hate everything about that.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.601
I always hoped
there'd be a day when

20:11.645 --> 20:14.300
my influence held sway.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.259
Like a real father.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.043
That boy needs you now
more than ever.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.834
[panel beeps]

20:26.877 --> 20:28.923
Jubilee and her children
were not kidnapped.

20:28.966 --> 20:32.753
They were running from her
estranged husband, Omega One.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.538
This guy forced her to marry him
after burning her village

20:35.582 --> 20:37.584
down to the ground. Then came
two kids, Rudi and Ela.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.455
HICKS:
Social Services was

20:39.499 --> 20:42.066
on their way here to get Ela.
I sent them back.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.851
We're gonna keep her in the
building under our protection.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.245
That's a good idea, although
Omega One cares primarily

20:46.288 --> 20:48.638
about getting his son back.CHRIS:
Yeah, the male heir

20:48.682 --> 20:50.814
to his drug business.
The wife and daughter

20:50.858 --> 20:52.425
obviously don't matter as much.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.731
I'm loving this sexist ass
more and more.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.864
Jubilee's desperate. Her plan
must have been to come to L.A.,

20:56.907 --> 20:58.909
hit up an Omega stash spot
and then use the cash

20:58.953 --> 21:00.694
to disappear with the kids.

21:00.737 --> 21:01.956
Except the Omegas found her,
nearly killed her,

21:01.999 --> 21:03.697
and then forced her
to leave without Ela.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.742
Our search warrant paid off.
We leveraged the Baja Diablos

21:05.786 --> 21:07.527
into pointing us to
an industrial warehouse

21:07.570 --> 21:09.268
the Omegas were
operating out of.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.661
Unis found two gasoline drums,
no witnesses.

21:11.705 --> 21:12.967
I know what that is.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.490
Each has a body inside

21:14.534 --> 21:15.883
so badly burnt
they're unrecognizable.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.146
Yeah, except for the
shirts found with them.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.930
Those are the shooters
from the stash spot.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.890
Omega One's cleaning
up loose ends.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
You've seen this before.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.676
The Omegas torture people,

21:26.720 --> 21:29.331
then dispose of their bodies
in gas drums.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.593
It's what Omega
One will do

21:30.637 --> 21:32.465
to Jubilee for trying
to take his son.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.770
HONDO: All right,
well, Jubilee didn't

21:33.814 --> 21:35.250
get any cash
from the stash spot,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.121
so she's got to be looking
to get money in other places.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.776
These are suspected
stash spots

21:39.820 --> 21:41.343
where Omega One might
keep his money.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.867
Too many to send
unis to each one.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.304
So let's narrow down the
choices-- I mean, just like

21:45.347 --> 21:47.175
the DEA keeps tabs
on the Omegas,

21:47.218 --> 21:49.482
the Omegas know
exactly how the DEA moves.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.005
So we need to think
like Jubilee.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.181
If I'm traveling with my young
son, I want to avoid places

21:53.224 --> 21:55.401
where I can easily
be trapped.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.968
Look for larger venues where she
can use a crowd to blend into.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.014
LUCA: A few high-traffic
casinos, hotels.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
A horse track, a downtown bank.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.669
HONDO:
All right, we're
getting closer,

22:02.712 --> 22:04.540
but we're not there yet.

22:05.628 --> 22:06.977
Say, Hondo.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.414
Yo, what's up, Deac?

22:08.457 --> 22:10.111
You remember that friend
that you mentioned

22:10.154 --> 22:12.461
that was looking to hire someone
to do security some nights?

22:12.505 --> 22:14.898
Yeah, my boy Dee Fletch,
owns an R&B joint in Inglewood.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.248
Why, you know someone?Yeah, me.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.903
I'm looking to moonlight
for some extra cash.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.340
Doesn't pay much.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.038
Ah, it's better
than nothing, right?

22:24.081 --> 22:25.648
Everything good with you?

22:25.692 --> 22:28.216
Yeah. It's just,
Matthew's doing karate

22:28.259 --> 22:30.653
and-and Lila wants
to start this dance thing

22:30.697 --> 22:32.307
which costs way more
than I expected.[chuckles]

22:32.351 --> 22:34.004
And that's before we
get to the little one

22:34.048 --> 22:35.484
and the new baby room.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.356
Being a good Catholic
sounds expensive, man.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.054
Tell me about it.[chuckles] But, yeah, yeah.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.535
I'll call him, check,
see if he's still got a spot.

22:42.578 --> 22:45.059
Okay. Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Mm-hmm.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.496
Hey, we still on for family
dinner this week? Annie's hoping

22:47.540 --> 22:49.716
to meet at least some of your
family one of these days.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.500
I don't know if you guys are
really ready for all that, man.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.675
Trust me.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.808
But, uh, you tell Annie
I'll be there.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.331
All right. Thanks again.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.550
Uh-huh.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.730
Excuse me, sir. Hey,
you got a second?

23:03.773 --> 23:05.427
Yeah, what do you need?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.124
Well, you know I'm looking
for a new place to live.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.778
Isn't this a monthly
thing with you?

23:08.822 --> 23:10.780
[chuckles] But I'm thinking
about planting roots

23:10.824 --> 23:13.827
and I might put in a bid for a
place that Deacon recommended.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.394
The HUD advisory
board is looking

23:15.437 --> 23:17.700
for the best officer
candidate to move in.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.963
I'm a single guy
with a good rep

23:20.007 --> 23:21.878
who might start a family
some day, you know,

23:21.922 --> 23:24.228
engage in the neighborhood,
figure I got a shot.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.449
But, if you could put
in a good word for me,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.146
that would go a long way.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.800
You see the neighborhood
this is in?
Yeah, no, I know.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.846
Normally, I'm really
picky about where I live,

23:32.889 --> 23:34.674
but they say it's got
a lot of character.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.153
Well, that's
one word for it.

23:36.197 --> 23:37.851
What do you mean?

23:37.894 --> 23:39.766
When you grew up with
your father, were you
in the city limits?

23:39.809 --> 23:41.420
No. Always in
Simi Valley.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.030
You know the reason
for that.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.945
Right. The last thing you want
is for people you police

23:44.988 --> 23:46.947
to know where you live
'cause as a cop,

23:46.990 --> 23:48.905
that can make you a target.Exactly.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.298
I mean, do you want
to be driving home,

23:50.341 --> 23:51.952
looking over both
shoulders every night?

23:51.995 --> 23:55.042
No, I get it, but there's got to
be a way to change that, right?

23:55.085 --> 23:58.741
[chuckles] Hey, look, I don't
want to be a hard-ass.

23:58.785 --> 24:02.745
I'll endorse this if you want,
but give it some thought.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.313
You know, there's a,
there's a saying

24:05.356 --> 24:06.706
that your grandfather
taught me

24:06.749 --> 24:09.317
and you'd be wise
to remember it.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.319
"Just because you
work at the dump,

24:11.362 --> 24:13.234
it doesn't mean you
have to live there."

24:17.760 --> 24:19.762
Ela.

24:27.770 --> 24:31.513
...Peppermint Crunch
and Banana Surprise and Peachy.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.602
[speaking Turkish]

24:33.646 --> 24:35.343
I suck at this.

24:35.386 --> 24:38.346
I think she's saying
that her mom is gonna

24:38.389 --> 24:39.521
take her to see food.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.349
Peppermint Crunch
and Banana Surprise.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.524
Wait a second.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.743
Ask her about, um,

24:43.786 --> 24:46.789
Swirly Whirly
and Cherries Jubilee.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.097
STREET:
Ela...

24:56.320 --> 24:57.800
See, your language skills
are fine.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.498
You just have to learn how
to speak seven-year-old girl.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.412
Those are My Little Pony
characters.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.805
Well, she said that
her mom was gonna

25:02.849 --> 25:04.720
take her and her brother
to see them.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.897
Jubilee's going to a stash
spot at some toy store?

25:07.941 --> 25:09.856
Or she's going to a place
where there are horses,

25:09.899 --> 25:12.380
like a racetrack.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.345
[announcer shouting
indistinctly]

25:21.389 --> 25:24.131
[cheering]

25:52.681 --> 25:54.204
MAN:
Hello, Jubilee.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.163
[gasps]

26:03.823 --> 26:06.129
[sirens wailing]

26:13.659 --> 26:14.660
We got to clear this location.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.226
We got to find
Jubilee and her son.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.055
Move, move!

26:24.713 --> 26:26.149
LAPD!

26:26.193 --> 26:27.281
Put your weapons down!

26:30.066 --> 26:31.633
[speaking Turkish]

26:35.594 --> 26:37.421
They have another one
of those monsters!

26:37.465 --> 26:39.641
We've got to stop them
before they get Jubilee inside.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.470
I got this.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.647
Concentrate 20 rounds
in the same spot.

26:45.691 --> 26:46.517
Light 'em up!

26:53.350 --> 26:55.004
Forward! Move forward!

26:55.048 --> 26:58.094
Hands on the ground
or you're dead!

26:58.138 --> 27:00.314
Get on the ground!

27:00.357 --> 27:02.272
Deacon! Deacon!I'm with you!

27:02.316 --> 27:04.318
Stay down! Stay
down! Don't move!TAN: Don't move!

27:04.361 --> 27:07.538
Do not move! Stay down!Nobody move!

27:07.582 --> 27:10.411
Hey. You okay?
Yeah, it's okay.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.457
We can't let him
get away, Deac.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.155
Can't shoot him here, either;
watch the background.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.334
[grunts]

27:33.608 --> 27:36.132
[announcer shouting
indistinctly]

27:44.837 --> 27:45.838
[woman whooping]

27:52.975 --> 27:54.803
[electricity crackles]

28:16.477 --> 28:18.000
That all of them?

28:18.044 --> 28:19.741
Yeah.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.003
No sign of Omega One.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.484
But we got Jubilee and Rudi
back alive.

28:28.663 --> 28:31.753
Yo, Hondo, you mind
if I pick your brain?

28:31.797 --> 28:33.712
Anything you need,
man, what's up?

28:33.755 --> 28:36.279
Thinking about doing that
good neighbor house program.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.107
Ha. Congrats, man.[chuckles] Thanks, man.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.718
Which neighborhood?

28:39.761 --> 28:42.416
East Hollywood.Okay. That's cool.

28:42.459 --> 28:43.896
Only I'm not
so sure about it.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.550
I mean, you've lived in the city
your whole life. Right?

28:46.594 --> 28:49.728
Most cops don't do that.
So, why do you?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.555
Well, it's a little
different for me, man.

28:51.599 --> 28:52.992
That's where I'm from.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.559
I mean, if I was moving to a
new area for the first time,

28:55.603 --> 28:57.605
maybe that might
make it different.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.999
But would you still do it?

29:00.042 --> 29:02.610
Look, I get there's
risk involved.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.351
I mean, if I had a wife
and a family, I mean,

29:04.394 --> 29:06.701
that might change
my thinking.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.572
But you want to
make a difference

29:08.616 --> 29:11.184
in people's lives, right?Mm-hmm.

29:11.227 --> 29:12.663
And sometimes you
get to wondering

29:12.707 --> 29:15.144
if good intentions
are enough.

29:15.188 --> 29:19.583
But, that being said, I
believe in good intentions

29:19.627 --> 29:21.760
and that's why I do this.

29:21.803 --> 29:26.155
And a lot of the time, I
can't do that with a gun.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.553
We have Ela safe.
We're taking you to her now.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.946
I went back for her.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.599
By the time I went back,
she was already with you.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.819
I would never leave
my baby all alone.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.603
I would never,
ever do that.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.822
We know. A-And
she's okay.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.258
Do you think
she will forgive me?

29:42.302 --> 29:43.651
I think she'll be happy
to see that you're alive.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.914
I'm so sorry this happened.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.829
Hey!And I'm sorry for this, too.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.440
Kamile, stop!No! No!

29:50.484 --> 29:51.920
What are you doing?I'm taking the boy.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.182
What? No, please, please!

29:53.226 --> 29:55.141
[shouts]Not another word

29:55.184 --> 29:56.403
or I will shoot him.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.622
Jessica, your car keys.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.974
JESSICA:
Don't do this.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.410
You're working
for him now?

30:03.453 --> 30:05.978
No. That's the
last thing I'd do.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.937
I've been trying to find
Omega One for a year and a half.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.460
Nobody can get to him.

30:10.504 --> 30:13.420
With his son, now I can.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.813
JUBILEE:
Rudi! No!

30:14.856 --> 30:17.728
Why?
My sister. Oba.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.688
When I got too close
to the Omegas,

30:20.731 --> 30:22.777
they put her in a gasoline drum.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.954
And I'm sorry. But don't ruin
your life by doing this.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.870
The sacrifices we make, right?

30:28.914 --> 30:33.832
At least I can stop a monster
before he hurts anyone else.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.877
Rudi, no! No, Rudi, no!Kamile!

30:35.921 --> 30:37.836
[shouting in Turkish]Rudi!

30:37.879 --> 30:39.881
Rudi!

30:39.925 --> 30:40.664
Rudi, no!

30:40.708 --> 30:42.318
Kamile!Rudi!

30:42.362 --> 30:45.017
JUBILEE:
Rudi! [sobbing]

30:53.939 --> 30:55.679
Should be able to track
the GPS in your car.

30:55.723 --> 30:56.898
Kamile won't get far.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.595
She's not trying
to get away.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.467
It's a suicide mission
to kill Omega One.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.295
She's planning this as she goes,

31:02.338 --> 31:04.558
probably using an Omega
burner phone to contact him.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.560
Take Jubilee back to HQ.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.562
GPS from your car shows
it's a few miles away.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.564
Where?Industrial area.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.349
Any refineries nearby?
Or truck stops?

31:13.393 --> 31:14.655
You're thinking someplace
with a gasoline drum.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.004
Yeah.

31:29.365 --> 31:31.628
Where's Omega One?

31:31.672 --> 31:33.804
Where's the boy?We agreed on the phone.

31:33.848 --> 31:36.633
I want $5 million
in exchange for his son.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.853
$5 million inside.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.463
KAMILE:
I told you.

31:40.507 --> 31:43.814
Omega One hands the money
to me, personally.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.860
Not happening.
Where is the boy?

31:45.904 --> 31:49.298
Rudi is inside
this gasoline drum.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.736
Don't shoot. He's still alive.[Rudi shouts in Turkish]

31:52.780 --> 31:56.479
Omega One tortures people
before putting them in drums.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.481
I didn't do that,

31:58.525 --> 32:02.703
but if he doesn't come now...

32:02.746 --> 32:05.967
he'll see what I'm willing to do
to his flesh and blood.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.753
Okay.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.888
Please. Don't hurt my boy.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.716
This is what you do
to everyone else.

32:15.759 --> 32:17.718
Let him go.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.547
You shoot me,
they shoot you dead.

32:20.590 --> 32:23.463
I'm okay with that.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.595
HONDO:
LAPD SWAT!

32:25.639 --> 32:27.249
Let me see your hands!

32:27.293 --> 32:29.773

33:33.750 --> 33:35.404
Hondo spoke
with the DEA.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.406
They're working on relocating
Jubilee and her family.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.714
Give them new identities,
new place to live.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.150
New start.
Right.

33:42.194 --> 33:45.545
Nice job.
Not really.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.156
You guys brought in
the bad guys. What did I do?

33:48.200 --> 33:49.679
You really
don't see it?

33:49.723 --> 33:51.725
Treat people
like family.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.161
What you did with Ela
was just as important

33:53.205 --> 33:54.423
as what we
did out there.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.077
You did what you
were asked to do.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.818
People notice that.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.782
I'm gonna take off.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.747
Sir, I wanted you to know
I'm sorry about Kamile.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.705
I should've
done better.

34:15.749 --> 34:18.534
We wouldn't have found the mom
and the kid without her help.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.363
It was a tough call, plus,
you knew how to bring her in,

34:21.407 --> 34:25.193
and that's what matters.
You did your job.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.847
Hey.

34:26.890 --> 34:30.764
It's not easy finding the
balance between life and work.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.071
Kamile obviously
struggled with that.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.855
The sacrifices we make.

34:34.898 --> 34:38.467
[chuckles] I raised a family
while doing this job.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.687
I don't think I ever really
figured it out.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.428
Might be different for a man.

34:42.471 --> 34:45.561
Well, probably is,

34:45.605 --> 34:47.781
but the sacrifices are there
no matter what.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.871
Hmm.
You know,

34:50.914 --> 34:51.872
the past few years
without Barb,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.917
I've had to do
things on my own.

34:53.961 --> 34:58.139
A lot of stress,
a lot of mistakes,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.707
a lot of compromises.

35:00.750 --> 35:04.624
But trying to find that balance,
that's what keeps me sane.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.801
You good?

35:07.844 --> 35:10.369
I'm good.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.327
All right.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.506
[lock buzzes]

35:21.293 --> 35:23.817
You talk to Darryl?Yeah.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.298
Good. All right, look,
I've been doing some research.

35:26.341 --> 35:27.821
I got a friend who's a D.A.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.344
Hondo.No, listen, listen.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.955
State props give discretion
to courts as to whether or not

35:31.999 --> 35:32.956
to charge a juvenile
as an adult.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.176
Hondo.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.613
I talked to my son.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.485
He's no Einstein.
He ain't going to college.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.051
Hell, he ain't gonna
finish high school.

35:41.095 --> 35:44.707
Okay, but as long as he can
avoid doing a serious stint,

35:44.751 --> 35:46.013
I might still have a chance

35:46.056 --> 35:48.494
to get him into the Marines
when he's 18.

35:48.537 --> 35:51.932
Maybe this is his best path.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.934
What path?

35:53.977 --> 35:55.544
Look, I thought about it.

35:55.588 --> 35:59.418
I thought about when you, me,
and big Darryl used to hang.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.420
Now, you realize,
of the three of us,

36:01.463 --> 36:04.292
one is dead, one is in prison,
and the other is you.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.816
I think about that all the time.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.384
Odds ain't never
been great, dawg.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.038
Not everybody can be Hondo.

36:11.081 --> 36:12.953
Look,

36:12.996 --> 36:16.435
I tried to keep my son
out of the life,

36:16.478 --> 36:19.046
but he just keeps
looking for it.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.526
Maybe it's for a reason.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.397
It's not, Leroy.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.965
He got a baby on the way now.
He got bills.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.488
Okay, what does that mean?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.751
So what, you're just, you're
gonna give up on your son?

36:28.795 --> 36:31.058
Don't ever say that.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.279
If this is the life
he's gonna choose,

36:34.322 --> 36:36.411
I should prepare him,

36:36.455 --> 36:37.934
hook him up
with the right people,

36:37.978 --> 36:41.024
help him survive it,
thrive in it.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.549
How do you measure success
in this life?

36:43.592 --> 36:45.768
Stay alive?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.770
Earn respect? Come on, man.

36:47.814 --> 36:50.077
Watch your tone.

36:52.645 --> 36:53.907
This is the same ghetto rap

36:53.950 --> 36:55.387
you've been spitting
since day one.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.566
I've known you
my entire life, Leroy.

37:00.609 --> 37:03.351
Your granddaddy did time.

37:03.395 --> 37:06.789
Your pops did time.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.965
Darryl's supposed to be the one
to break that cycle.

37:09.009 --> 37:14.101
Yeah, but it's my cycle
because he's my son, not yours.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.240
[knocks on door]

37:25.068 --> 37:27.070
HONDO:
Leroy.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.687
Darryl might
be guilty,

37:34.730 --> 37:38.299
but there are still
plea deals to be made, man.

37:38.343 --> 37:41.650
Ways of making sure that his
future isn't completely ruined.

37:41.694 --> 37:46.133
I ain't giving up.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.266
I'm never gonna
quit on him.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.139
I know.

37:54.968 --> 37:58.014
But nobody's asking for
your help here anymore.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.109
Sometimes things
don't work out.

38:06.153 --> 38:09.939
Sometimes it just be that way.

38:12.551 --> 38:16.032
Appreciate you checking in,
though, dawg.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.913
Ah, here we go.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.915
Come on.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.352
[car alarm blaring in distance]

38:31.396 --> 38:33.789
Whoa.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.922
This redefines "do it yourself."

38:35.965 --> 38:39.882
Hmm.
I tried to
warn you, Luca.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.934
LUCA:
Hey.

38:47.977 --> 38:49.892
This neighborhood
got a graffiti problem?

38:49.936 --> 38:51.807
It does.
Well, what's the
point of doing that?

38:51.851 --> 38:54.375
Well, every day,
there's graffiti.

38:54.419 --> 38:58.292
Every night,
I'm here to paint it over.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.380
Hmm.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.382
You're a cop, right?How'd you know?

39:01.426 --> 39:02.905
Look like one.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.646
Are you moving here?

39:04.690 --> 39:07.519
Uh... I'm thinking on it.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.217
All right, thanks.

39:10.260 --> 39:13.133
You ever own a house?First one.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.091
You got a mortgage guy?Nah.

39:15.135 --> 39:16.702
I'm just gonna pay cash.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.051
I mean,
it's a good price, right?

39:18.094 --> 39:21.359
Plus, I've been
saving money up for years.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.491
Used to call it "screw you
money" that I could live on

39:23.535 --> 39:25.232
if anyone ever tried
to get me to do something

39:25.275 --> 39:26.364
I didn't believe in.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.235
Money to quit your job?[chuckles]

39:28.278 --> 39:29.845
Maybe you shouldn't
tell me that.

39:29.889 --> 39:34.110
Now, I'm thinking, I'm thinking
I could fix this place up.

39:34.154 --> 39:37.636
I could put a pool table
in the living room,

39:40.029 --> 39:41.466
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

39:41.509 --> 39:43.293
Hell yeah.

39:43.337 --> 39:45.165
I got a feeling
we're gonna be responding

39:45.208 --> 39:47.776
to a lot of noise
complaints here.
[chuckles]

39:47.820 --> 39:50.518

Hey.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.790
Everything okay?

40:01.834 --> 40:04.532
Honestly, no.

40:06.142 --> 40:09.929
Can I come in?Of course.

40:18.851 --> 40:22.158
You know, Nia,

40:22.202 --> 40:26.119
when I was training
to be a cop... [scoffs]

40:26.162 --> 40:29.818
my goal...

40:29.862 --> 40:31.951
was to help people,

40:31.994 --> 40:33.779
like my friend's son Darryl.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.128
From what I
know about you,

40:35.171 --> 40:36.825
I'm sure you did help him.

40:36.869 --> 40:41.134
Did I really? I mean, really?

40:43.353 --> 40:46.095
I mean,
you're a D.A.

40:46.139 --> 40:50.317
You know the way it goes.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.233
No matter the intentions
we may have,

40:53.276 --> 40:55.757
even when we put
ourselves out there...

40:58.456 --> 41:02.285
...it doesn't matter.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.418
Just more holes
in the dam to plug.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.377
So? Then we just keep
plugging them, right?

41:09.554 --> 41:11.469
I hear what you're saying.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.298
You want to be the change.

41:15.342 --> 41:18.127
But, ultimately,

41:18.171 --> 41:21.087
you don't know if you'll ever
really be able to.

41:27.093 --> 41:30.313
There's a quote my
father used to say:

41:30.357 --> 41:34.666
"I can't be a pessimist
because I'm alive.

41:34.709 --> 41:39.148
"I'm forced to believe
that we can survive

must survive."

the same thing to me.

a choice

41:56.644 --> 41:59.734
but to be optimists.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.780
But being an optimist
is a burden.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.260
It means

42:04.304 --> 42:07.133
a lot of disappointment,

42:07.176 --> 42:09.744
and sometimes,

42:09.788 --> 42:12.791
a little anger.
