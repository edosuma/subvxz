I'm sure we're
on the same page about this,

but you probably just wanna
keep things casual... right?

04:50.873 --> 04:52.292
Absolutely.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.173
This is good, right?

05:00.091 --> 05:04.095
Bro, this... is ideal.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.518
It's just... she did
frame it as a question.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.980
She didn't say that <i>she</i> wanted
to keep it casual, necessarily.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.442
She asked me if I wanted to,
so now I'm wondering if--

05:17.442 --> 05:20.111
Stop wondering, okay?
Lose the wonder.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.239
- No... you're right.
Of course, I'm fuckin' right, man.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.491
Steady sex, zero obligations.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.910
You get to do it with Lindsay
and whoever else you want.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.538
And she's the one that's
suggesting it? Aah!

05:31.039 --> 05:32.790
It's the Holy Grail
of fuckery, man.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.417
- And we don't have to get attached.
No!

05:34.417 --> 05:36.961
- We don't have to get feelings involved.
- Exactly.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.881
- Just... sex.
Yeah.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.259
- There's nothing special about it.
- Special? Bro.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.011
- Fuck special!

05:45.011 --> 05:46.471
Sex is always special for him.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.598
He could be getting
a dumpster blow job

05:48.598 --> 05:51.351
from a snaggle-toothed
prostitute named Chuckles.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.727
He'd be madly in love

05:52.727 --> 05:54.520
by the time she finished
undoing his belt buckle.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.189
Nuh-uh, no, no, no, no.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.941
- That's the old Miguel.
- Yeah, that's not me anymore.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.568
Oh, not since 12 minutes ago

06:00.568 --> 06:01.778
when you were ready to start

06:01.778 --> 06:03.196
pickin' out the name
of your first child?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.740
O-kay. That was just--

06:05.740 --> 06:08.117
I was caught up in the moment.
This is what happens.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.869
Uh, is that the same thing
that happened with me?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.580
You know, when I let
you go up my shirt

06:12.580 --> 06:13.748
'cause I was trying
to get back at

06:13.748 --> 06:14.874
Rod for fingering that skank

06:14.874 --> 06:16.584
from Holy Cross with
the twitchy eye?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.044
-  Nice.
And you promised

06:18.044 --> 06:19.670
to not get weird after it.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.672
And then, you wrote
me those poems,

06:21.672 --> 06:25.510
and some of them were,
like, bizarrely sexual.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.514
About, like...
"fragrant tulip buds?"

06:31.349 --> 06:33.726
- Hey, it's not that weird.
- It's pretty fuckin' weird.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.104
It was a long time ago!
Is the point.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.605
I was a kid.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.900
- Things are different now.
- You're a man.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
- I'm a man.
- Yeah.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.907
Wow. That was--

06:48.616 --> 06:50.618
- I should get going.
- Oh.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.620
Okay?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.122
Yeah, I just need to

06:54.122 --> 06:55.832
prep for this meeting.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.126
Oh... what's the meeting?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.253
Um, you wouldn't be interested.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.754
I'm asking.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.883
I, uh, think I... may have
found my own business

07:05.883 --> 07:07.176
to bring in.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.764
- To the bank.
- Oh... Well, that, that sounds good.

07:11.764 --> 07:16.477
- Is that good?
- Yeah, it is good. It is... very good.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.605
- It's very good?
- Very, very good.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.108
- Well, dang.
- If I can land it.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.317
Well, you're not the only one

07:23.317 --> 07:25.153
with life-changing
professional news.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.655
I finally get to do
my very own Staff Pick

07:27.655 --> 07:29.782
- at the bookstore.
- Okay. What are you gonna choose?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.492
<i>Fitness Walking For Dummies.</i>

07:31.951 --> 07:33.494
It's a completely
rigged process.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.037
We just do whichever book

07:35.037 --> 07:36.622
we've ordered too
many copies of.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.082
God, this is just like

07:38.082 --> 07:39.667
the night I found out
the Tooth Fairy

07:39.667 --> 07:41.586
was actually just my dad

07:41.586 --> 07:44.422
rifling through his wallet
for small bills.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.715
Truth hurts.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.052
Uh, do you think
that pizza place

07:50.052 --> 07:51.512
at the end of your block
is still open?

07:51.512 --> 07:53.598
Ooh, I don't know.
Let's find out.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.682
Uhh.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.811
You really think we should
be doin' that?

08:00.313 --> 08:03.399
- Going out for dinner?
- It's a slice of pizza.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.152
Yeah, it's, it's probably better,
though, right, if we just

08:06.152 --> 08:09.155
- keep things simple, keep it casual.
I think we could

08:09.155 --> 08:12.992
get a slice of pizza
without falling madly in love.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.452
That's true.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.543
Yeah... let's do it.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.916

09:26.315 --> 09:27.608
Maybe she's in love with you.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.444

10:47.521 --> 10:49.690

piece of writing

that confronts the riddle
of human mortality

11:21.347 --> 11:23.432
with more courage,

11:23.432 --> 11:25.726
more honesty,

11:25.726 --> 11:28.771
than <i>Goodnight, Moon.</i>

11:29.146 --> 11:33.109
"The quiet old lady...

11:33.109 --> 11:34.235

12:38.924 --> 12:39.925
I usually don't even read it,

12:39.925 --> 12:42.011
but then I saw
the profile on you,

12:42.011 --> 12:44.597
and I was so inspired
by your story.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.390
Jimmy showed me the article
and I was like,

12:46.390 --> 12:47.975
"Wait, I know that dude."

12:47.975 --> 12:49.643
I was this guy's
surfing teacher.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.062
Uh, the teacher learned much
from the student,

12:52.062 --> 12:53.522
if methinks correctly.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.318
Well, listen, I just wanted
to be here for the intros.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.236
I will let
my esteemed colleague,

12:59.236 --> 13:01.113
Jimmy, take it from here.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.240
Still recoverin' from
my bachelor party.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.827
Cardboard Jimmy was a champ.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.954
Oh... good.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.122
So, as I was saying,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.457
I was so impressed

13:11.457 --> 13:12.750
by all that you've done,

13:12.750 --> 13:14.210
creating the 12th largest

13:14.210 --> 13:15.669
juice brand in the world.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.421
Number one cruelty free.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.215
I didn't realize that.
That's great to know.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.176
Oh yeah, and we don't test
our shit on bonobos and whatnot.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.178
I'm, I'm very firm on that.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.387
Well, and I think it's exactly

13:25.387 --> 13:26.555
that commitment to your vision--

13:26.555 --> 13:28.474
And I wanna murder Snapple.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.479
- What's that?
- I said I want to murder Snapple.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.689
That's the other part of this.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.609
I want to take a pillow
and hold it over its face

13:38.609 --> 13:41.779
until it, it goes lifeless,
and it dies.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.615
Can you help me do that?

13:48.536 --> 13:49.829
I believe you have
the potential

13:49.829 --> 13:51.497
to outperform
any of your competitors.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.957
You just need the right partner.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.750
Someone who has relationships

13:54.750 --> 13:56.710
to key players in private equity

13:56.710 --> 13:58.921
to get you the capital you need

13:58.921 --> 14:02.383
to make Squez...
a fruit juice empire.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.053
Wait until you hear
what I wanna do to Ocean Spray.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
Why don't I grab
us another round

14:09.056 --> 14:10.266
and you can
tell me all about it?

14:10.266 --> 14:11.892
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.150
Looks like a fun meet.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.408
Do you know, uh, Squez Juice?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.953
Of course. Can't live without
my daily Berry Bonanza.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.996
That's the guy.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.958
- It's always the weirdos.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.544
Uh, hey, can I get
another round of, uh,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.796
- Johnnie Walker Gold, please?
- Sure.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.840
- You're in finance.
- How'd you guess?

14:42.840 --> 14:47.177
Armani jacket, Ferragamo shoes,
criminally overpriced Scotch.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.430
- Well.
- I know the type.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.515
I'm at Lehman. Arbitrage.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.225
Winnicott. Analyst.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.894
Oh, you're a baby.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.645
Not quite.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.316
My home number is on the back.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.817
Oh.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.944
I'm sorta seein' someone.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.363
You fuckin' rube!

15:06.363 --> 15:07.656
But it's casual.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.992
It's very casual.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.120
Well... casual works for me.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.841
Ask if they have walnuts.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.676
Whole nuts.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.220
I brought my own nutcracker.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.644
Walnuts?

15:43.150 --> 15:44.151
Hey.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.239
Should probably go.

15:49.823 --> 15:53.035
I've got a... a ton of work
to get through this weekend.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.120
Oh... okay.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.207
Oh, hey, how did the
big meeting go?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.917
Pretty great, actually.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.795
I mean... still need
to put together a deal, but.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.797
But then you get
to be assistant.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.006
Associate.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.050
Which is...
better than assistant?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.551
There is no assistant.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.180
There's analyst
and then there's associate.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.432
Well, in that case, yay!

16:16.475 --> 16:17.559
No.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.065
I used to love reading
this book.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.526
Yeah, me too.

16:25.526 --> 16:29.446
You know, he did a reading
at the store the other day.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.032
Yeah, I introduced myself
and told him I was a writer.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.618
- No! You met Mr. McGooch?!
-  Yeah.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.998
God. My six-year-old self
is seething with envy.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.292
He was actually...
kind of amazing.

16:43.085 --> 16:48.632
And I think... talking to him...
might've made me realize that I

16:48.632 --> 16:51.760
kinda wanna... try
writing a children's book.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.181
There's a lot more to them
than people realize.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.684
Yeah... why not?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.228
Yeah, why not?

17:01.228 --> 17:03.981
I used to read this
to my little brother.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.859
- He was obsessed.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.944
Right after my mom died,
my dad worked two jobs,

17:08.944 --> 17:12.031
and I had to take over
the whole bedtime routine.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.034
- How old were you when--
- I was 10.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.495
And then we had to move,
and that... sucked.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.247
How come?

17:21.081 --> 17:25.419
Well, we lived in Westchester.
It's, like, the suburbs.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.629
But when my dad couldn't
swing two jobs

17:27.629 --> 17:28.964
and two kids by himself,

17:28.964 --> 17:32.092
- we had to move to Queens.
- Why Queens?

17:32.092 --> 17:34.053
It's where he grew up,
in Jackson Heights.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.014
It was like my whole life
had been this one way,

17:37.014 --> 17:39.308
and then, all of a sudden,

17:39.808 --> 17:40.976
it wasn't.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.686
My Spanish was shit.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.564
And I didn't know anybody.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.197
Sorry.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.699
Thanks.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.537
I'll be right back, okay?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.173
Hello?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.050
Ugh.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.384
No, for the last time,

18:14.384 --> 18:15.928
there is no one here named Dave.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.597
Please, you have
to stop calling, seriously.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.854
What are you... doing later?

18:25.854 --> 18:29.149
'Cause I have this thing
I, I might go to,

18:29.149 --> 18:33.195
but I was thinking maybe
we could grab dinner?

18:33.195 --> 18:36.573
I mean, I realized earlier
that we've never actually eaten

18:36.573 --> 18:38.617
inside of a building together.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.703
Uh, I have plans
already, actually,

18:41.703 --> 18:43.789
with, uh, another--

18:45.582 --> 18:48.794
- with someone else, so I can't.
- Oh.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.506
Okay, well...
rain check then, I guess?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.633
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.931
- See ya later.
- 'Kay.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.742
I'm glad you called.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.244
Me too.

19:31.795 --> 19:34.339
Welcome to the real
<i>Bubbling Big Top.</i>

19:39.052 --> 19:41.430
Rockin' atmosphere.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.974
This is where I
get all my ideas.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.477
- Really? Ah.
- Hey, Emile.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.731
Oh my god, Emile.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.482
I told you,
children's literature

19:52.482 --> 19:55.444
is much more complicated
than people realize.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.362
Yes.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.074
I,

20:02.492 --> 20:05.204
I think...
I think I wanna write one,

20:05.829 --> 20:07.664
a, a children's book, I mean.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.335
I... I wanna write
the kind of... children's book

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
I wish I had...
when I was a kid.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.297
What kinda book would that be?

20:15.297 --> 20:20.385
Well, growing up, I guess
I always felt like kind of a--

20:21.386 --> 20:23.388
like a weirdo.

20:24.806 --> 20:29.144
You know, I had all these
big ideas and feelings,

20:29.144 --> 20:33.649
and... I just thought
that there was something

20:35.108 --> 20:37.986
wrong with me, honestly.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.323
I just wish I'd had
a book to read

20:41.323 --> 20:43.242
that told me that there wasn't.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.285
That you don't always
have to be...

20:45.285 --> 20:47.955
good or nice.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.375
I think... if I'd
had that,

20:51.375 --> 20:54.544
my life would've turned out
a lot different.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.256
As soon as you finish
writing that book,

20:57.881 --> 20:59.258
send it to me.

20:59.841 --> 21:00.759
Really?

21:00.759 --> 21:02.219
- Really.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.378
Um, ho-hold, hold on.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.173
- What's wrong?
- Uh, I-I'm, I'm just wonderin' if maybe--

21:40.173 --> 21:42.009
Hey... Hello?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.760
- Who's that?
Oh shit.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.721
He wasn't supposed
to fly back until tomorrow.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.515
Who wasn't supposed to fly
back 'til tomorrow? -I'm j--

21:48.515 --> 21:50.976
What the fucking fuck,
Jimmy?!

21:50.976 --> 21:52.728
Are you trying to
fuck my fiancé?!

21:52.728 --> 21:54.396
- What?!
- Answer me, you fucking traitor!

21:54.396 --> 21:57.733
Are you tryna fuck my fiancé
in my fucking apartment?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.609
I didn't know she
was your fiancé!

21:59.609 --> 22:02.154
Chad, please don't
do anything crazy, okay?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.405
Not like last time.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.865
You wanna fuck her,
you sick, fuckin' pervert?

22:04.865 --> 22:07.034
- No.
- Go on. Fuck her.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.661
- Don't let me stop you.
- I mean, if he's insisting.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.330
Oh, I'm insisting all right.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.623
And he's just gonna
sit there and watch.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.792
And I'm just gonna sit here

22:15.792 --> 22:18.795
and watch with my pants off.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.672
What choice do we have?

22:23.216 --> 22:24.134
Wait a minute.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.886
Not into it?

22:27.387 --> 22:29.139
Oh my god!

22:29.139 --> 22:32.309
We said casual,
which I was totally okay with--

22:32.309 --> 22:35.479
Mm.
- I thought I was totally okay with,

22:35.479 --> 22:37.939
but maybe part of me
always thought there was

22:38.273 --> 22:41.151
something special... about her.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.070
I don't know.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.572
Thank you for listening.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.407
Any time.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.246
I hope this isn't rude
of me to say, but

22:54.289 --> 22:56.917
I don't understand
how you guys can

22:57.751 --> 22:58.710
do what you do.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.380
I mean,
don't you get jealous or?

23:01.380 --> 23:02.672
You know our secret?

23:03.173 --> 23:04.841
We have one unbreakable rule:

23:05.342 --> 23:06.385
honesty.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.845
We tell each other exactly
what we want.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.640
No half-truths and
no game playing.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.184
Yeah, as long as we both
want the same thing, great.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.477
And if we don't,

23:16.436 --> 23:18.063
then we'll deal with that, too.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.817
Look, I don't know
if you'd be interested in this,

23:21.817 --> 23:23.652
but, uh, if you did
wanna stick around,

23:23.652 --> 23:25.195
we could start with
some light ticklin'.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.988
I'm good... thanks.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.075
- Fair enough. Hmm.
- Okay.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.247
After everything I
have done for you,

23:35.247 --> 23:36.748
all that I have sacrificed,

23:36.748 --> 23:39.042
all the hours I spent
trying to graft some

23:39.042 --> 23:40.752
semblance of testicles
to your scrotum,

23:40.752 --> 23:42.712
and you're just gonna--
you're gonna throw it all away!

23:42.712 --> 23:44.714
I knew he couldn't do casual.
I said it from the beginning.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.174
Except I can do casual, actually.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.051
I could've had sex
with Rachel all night long.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.220
- That is highly debatable!
- And I wouldn't have felt anything.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.097
But it's different with Lindsay.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.891
It's special...
because she's special.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.435
Well, what are
you talking about?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.936
You felt the same thing with me.

23:58.812 --> 24:02.065
- Maybe you were special, too.
- That is actually very sweet.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.359
Okay, but that's the
problem, Miguel.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.655
- You're not special... at all.
Mm-hm.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.458
Hey.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.501
Oh, hi.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.295
I hope you don't mind
that I came by.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.589
N-No, it's great
to see you, um.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.674
I don't have
super long to talk, though,

24:27.674 --> 24:28.884
just because the new

24:28.884 --> 24:31.303
Sue Grafton joint just dropped,
<i>O For Outlaw,</i>

24:31.303 --> 24:33.722
and let me tell you,
we are "S" for screwed

24:33.722 --> 24:35.724
because we don't have
the manpower to handle this.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.517
No, no, no.
This, this won't take long.

24:37.517 --> 24:41.229
It's just, um, there's something
I need to tell you, um.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.191
I was with someone last night.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.609
Um.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.027
Oh.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.862
It, it didn't mean anything,

24:48.862 --> 24:51.615
but it made me realize--

24:51.615 --> 24:53.408
I, I just have to say,

24:53.408 --> 24:55.494
I-I'm so glad that you
brought this up

24:55.494 --> 24:59.414
because I, too,
was with someone last night.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.958
And I j--
I didn't know if we were,

25:01.958 --> 25:03.668
if we were gonna share that...

25:03.668 --> 25:06.296
news with each other or.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.382
It's actually someone
you know... sort of.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.259
It was... Ted.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.262
McGooch... Yeah.

25:14.262 --> 25:16.723
I mean, that's not
his real last name, but.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.725
You were with

25:20.185 --> 25:21.645
Mr. McGooch?

25:23.313 --> 25:26.983
W-Where did you go?
An underwater circus?

25:27.734 --> 25:29.819
Yeah, (laughs) actually.

25:29.819 --> 25:32.364
I mean, it was above
water, obviously,

25:32.364 --> 25:35.242
uh, and it was less
of a <i>circus</i> circus

25:35.242 --> 25:38.286
and more of a sex club

25:38.286 --> 25:40.705
with a circus theme?

25:41.414 --> 25:43.333
I just have to say I-I'm--

25:43.333 --> 25:46.294
I was really, really nervous
when we started this, you know,

25:46.294 --> 25:49.965
because I was like,
"Can people even be casual?"

25:49.965 --> 25:50.882
But

25:51.258 --> 25:53.009
this is what I came
to New York for,

25:53.009 --> 25:58.640

Just like you were
saying, it made you realize--

28:44.055 --> 28:45.765
This was a mistake.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.685
For us to get involved.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.062
That's what I realized.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.648
For a lotta different reasons,

28:54.482 --> 28:57.152
we were better off as friends,

28:57.152 --> 28:58.236
so

29:00.113 --> 29:02.115
I think we should just

29:03.491 --> 29:04.492
do that.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.664
Yeah, I mean, if that's...
what you really want.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.251
Absolutely.
