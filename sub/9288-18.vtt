00:12.264 --> 00:16.894
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:18.037 --> 00:20.403
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

00:20.573 --> 00:23.906
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:24.844 --> 00:26.869
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer...

00:27.246 --> 00:30.579
...and today is the longest day of my life.

00:43.954 --> 00:46.115
Listen up, people. Listen up.

00:46.390 --> 00:48.586
Alexis Drazen was leaving here
for a meeting.

00:48.693 --> 00:50.719
At this meeting,
he was going to make a payoff.

00:50.863 --> 00:52.558
Somewhere in this room, there is money.

00:52.698 --> 00:55.065
I want it found. I want it found now.

00:55.935 --> 00:57.630
Elizabeth cannot be
held responsible for this.

00:57.737 --> 00:59.364
Senator, I don't disagree with you.

00:59.472 --> 01:02.671
But we have a video of her
stabbing a man with a letter opener.

01:02.778 --> 01:05.075
- You got her into this.
- No, sir, I did not.

01:05.180 --> 01:07.672
I did not ask her to stab Alexis Drazen.

01:08.184 --> 01:10.744
I misjudged her ability
to handle this operation...

01:10.887 --> 01:13.949
...and, as I said before,
I will do everything I can to help her.

01:16.861 --> 01:18.795
I know you're just trying to protect me.

01:19.364 --> 01:23.200
Senator, I understand
the situation that you're in...

01:23.637 --> 01:27.233
...but I do not need to remind you
there are at least 2 suspects at large.

01:28.343 --> 01:29.833
Sir, please, I implore you...

01:30.011 --> 01:32.411
...have as much security around you
as you can tolerate...

01:32.513 --> 01:34.039
...and let us do our job.

01:38.722 --> 01:41.089
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir. I promise I will.

01:58.813 --> 02:00.406
- Bingo.
- Found it!

02:02.051 --> 02:03.109
What?

02:03.586 --> 02:04.746
Bearer bonds.

02:06.924 --> 02:08.652
As good as cash and easier to move.

02:08.793 --> 02:10.624
You got the address of the restaurant yet?

02:10.828 --> 02:13.092
California Plaza.
It's about 20 minutes from here.

02:13.264 --> 02:14.323
Good.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.464
How are you going to pull this off,
pretending to be Alexis?

02:17.604 --> 02:18.798
I don't know yet.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.267
Hey, Jay.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.508
Jay, come here. Give me your shirt.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.873
I'll go with you,
coordinate your backup.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.103
Fine.

02:36.059 --> 02:37.959
What's the update
on Bauer's family?

02:38.128 --> 02:38.996
Still missing.

02:39.130 --> 02:40.758
Anything back from forensics yet?

02:41.333 --> 02:43.164
Well, based on preliminary reports...

02:43.269 --> 02:45.464
...the agents were killed
protecting the women.

02:46.071 --> 02:48.267
We have to find the wife and daughter.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.010
I alerted the task force at District.

02:50.144 --> 02:52.942
Why don't you call and see if
they need anything from us?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.015
All right.

02:54.850 --> 02:58.217
Tony, still no word to Jack
on any of this, understand?

02:59.455 --> 03:01.084
What do you want me to tell him
if he calls and asks?

03:02.993 --> 03:04.426
You're working on something else...

03:04.528 --> 03:06.258
...and put him through to me, okay?

03:21.182 --> 03:22.740
What are you guys looking for?

03:22.918 --> 03:26.548
Whoever Dan worked for might have
Information about my mom.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.247
The guy who was in charge, Gaines...

03:28.358 --> 03:30.258
...I never met him before.
Dan knew him.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.759
Maybe his number is here.

03:32.062 --> 03:34.965
What are you going to do,
call him and ask for your mom back?

03:35.200 --> 03:38.363
Any information I find,
I'm going to give it to the police.

03:39.606 --> 03:42.234
You hear that, Rick?
She's going to call the police.

03:42.609 --> 03:43.633
That's okay with you?

03:43.943 --> 03:45.673
You said you didn't trust the police.

03:46.248 --> 03:48.239
Whatever. I'll give it to my dad.

03:50.185 --> 03:53.781
Dan'll go ballistic when he finds out
you've been going through his stuff.

03:58.896 --> 04:00.626
You didn't tell her Dan is dead?

04:00.899 --> 04:02.992
Not yet. I didn't want to freak her out.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.601
Dan's brother Frank
is on his way here...

04:05.838 --> 04:07.272
...and I don't want him to know.

04:09.476 --> 04:11.068
Don't say anything, okay?

04:12.647 --> 04:13.545
Okay.

04:17.250 --> 04:21.189
This is such a waste of time.
We're never going to find anything.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.615
I don't even know why I came.

04:31.202 --> 04:32.602
You're married...

04:32.772 --> 04:34.967
...and you have a daughter named Kimberly.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.275
- I have a daughter?
- Yes.

04:38.544 --> 04:39.808
A teenage daughter.

04:42.216 --> 04:45.151
You and Jack, you were separated
about six months ago...

04:45.253 --> 04:46.414
...and that's when we met.

04:50.727 --> 04:52.093
Who are you?

04:52.830 --> 04:53.956
I'm a friend.

04:54.632 --> 04:56.395
A very good friend...

04:57.602 --> 04:59.298
...who wanted to be a lot more.

05:00.572 --> 05:01.471
But...

05:01.574 --> 05:05.409
You were afraid to start
a relationship, so we didn't.

05:05.613 --> 05:07.945
Then you decided
to go back with your husband.

05:09.516 --> 05:12.453
Maybe it was because of Kimberly.
I don't know.

05:13.189 --> 05:16.215
But you asked me not to call,
and I haven't.

05:20.197 --> 05:22.893
But I don't remember any of this.

05:23.868 --> 05:26.929
We need to get you
to a hospital, have you looked at.

05:27.139 --> 05:29.607
Why do we have to go?
You said you were a doctor.

05:29.708 --> 05:30.675
I'm a surgeon.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.944
You need to see a neurologist.
You've suffered a trauma.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.606
- I don't want to go to a hospital.
- Why not?

05:36.717 --> 05:38.743
I don't know, I just don't want to.

05:41.089 --> 05:43.182
What if I examined you here?

05:46.130 --> 05:47.188
Okay.

05:52.871 --> 05:56.433
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office...

05:56.642 --> 05:58.941
...that leads directly to you.

05:59.079 --> 06:02.845
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time around.

06:02.949 --> 06:05.646
But with a little help, they'll find it.

06:08.090 --> 06:10.115
So I'll be framed
for Ferragamo's murder?

06:10.292 --> 06:12.693
Like I said, whatever it takes.

06:18.737 --> 06:20.728
I don't know
what you think you've got here.

06:20.872 --> 06:23.739
What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb...

06:23.842 --> 06:26.277
...admitting that he set my son
up for murder.

06:28.147 --> 06:30.207
It's been a while
since I've practiced law...

06:30.317 --> 06:33.515
...but I know that unless Keith
was sanctioned by a court order...

06:33.722 --> 06:36.748
...and prepped by an authority,
this is not evidence.

06:36.858 --> 06:38.759
I've been in politics long enough to know...

06:38.861 --> 06:41.023
...that if the media gets a hold
of this tape...

06:41.131 --> 06:42.655
...the truth will come out.

06:43.366 --> 06:44.333
No.

06:44.736 --> 06:47.364
Today can't be about two things.

06:48.406 --> 06:49.430
It's either about...

06:49.540 --> 06:52.375
...winning the primary,
securing the party nomination.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.845
Or it's about...

06:54.948 --> 06:57.416
...a political scandal,
but it can't be about both.

07:08.231 --> 07:09.391
Destroy the tape.

07:10.733 --> 07:11.792
What?

07:12.102 --> 07:15.504
If you don't, not only
will you bring down yourself...

07:15.774 --> 07:17.766
...but you'll bring the party down with you.

07:18.077 --> 07:19.066
How do I do that?

07:19.178 --> 07:20.577
Because you'll win today.

07:20.746 --> 07:22.941
You'll have enough delegates by 8:00.

07:24.017 --> 07:27.476
You are the Democratic Party's
candidate for president...

07:27.588 --> 07:28.919
...whether you like it or not...

07:29.023 --> 07:30.889
...and if you decide to self-destruct...

07:31.059 --> 07:34.962
...it will take years
for the party's platform to recover.

07:35.732 --> 07:38.293
Why don't we let the electorate
decide on that.

07:39.837 --> 07:42.499
I don't consider telling the truth
self-destructive.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.205
And how bad will it be for the Democrats...

07:46.813 --> 07:49.304
...if somebody else comes out
with this first...

07:49.515 --> 07:51.450
...and I have to go on the defensive?

07:54.888 --> 07:56.549
What do you think, Mike?

07:58.327 --> 08:01.660
I've seen much uglier stories
kept under wraps.

08:04.334 --> 08:06.928
The only people
who know about this tape...

08:07.137 --> 08:09.800
...are the people in this room and Keith.

08:11.176 --> 08:14.111
This wouldn't be a difficult item to shelve.

08:15.147 --> 08:16.944
And besides, this is currency.

08:18.719 --> 08:21.688
Once you're in the White House,
this could protect you.

08:22.122 --> 08:24.387
- How?
- Think about it.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.627
You'll have evidence against...

08:26.728 --> 08:29.253
...some of the most powerful men
in the country.

08:35.438 --> 08:38.169
They won't be able to control you.

08:49.489 --> 08:51.789
Tony, it's Jack.
How's everything going there?

08:51.894 --> 08:52.724
Fine.

08:52.828 --> 08:55.296
I need to speak to Mason.
He's not in his office.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.456
He's down on the floor.
Let me transfer you.

08:57.567 --> 08:59.660
Okay, wait, before you do...

09:00.303 --> 09:02.032
Have you spoken to Teri yet?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.166
No, I haven't.

09:04.276 --> 09:06.972
Give me the number
of the safe house. I'll call there.

09:07.345 --> 09:10.372
Look, let me see if I can get that for you.
Hang on a second.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.849
- What's up?
- Jack's on the phone for you.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.057
Okay.

09:18.159 --> 09:19.888
He wants the number of the safe house.

09:20.094 --> 09:21.493
Of course he does.

09:23.999 --> 09:25.934
Why don't you just
tell him what happened?

09:26.036 --> 09:27.970
Why is this so hard for you to comprehend?

09:28.071 --> 09:31.974
The man is neck-deep in an investigation.
He has a job to do. Let's let him do it.

09:32.076 --> 09:34.909
When he's back in a controlled
environment, we'll tell him.

09:35.012 --> 09:36.641
Meanwhile, we have a job to do.

09:36.950 --> 09:39.418
I got to say, I just think it's wrong.

09:40.153 --> 09:41.745
It's not about right and wrong.

09:41.854 --> 09:44.415
It's about the fact
that we have to protect Palmer.

09:46.394 --> 09:47.554
He's on Line 2.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.458
Jack, it's me. Where are you?

09:49.564 --> 09:51.965
- We're going to a meet.
- What kind of meet?

09:52.101 --> 09:54.433
Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.265
- Payoff to who?
- I'm not sure yet.

09:56.473 --> 09:57.998
So what are you going to do?

09:58.142 --> 09:59.370
Pretend to be Alexis.

10:00.745 --> 10:02.474
You're never going to pull that off.

10:02.580 --> 10:06.073
Alexis was supposed to pay this guy
$50,000 in bearer bonds.

10:06.185 --> 10:07.846
You have to work with me on this.

10:07.987 --> 10:10.514
I need backup. Milo's got the address.

10:10.624 --> 10:13.092
We should be there
in about 15 minutes.

10:13.995 --> 10:17.432
You keep this guy in play, we got a
chance of bringing these guys down.

10:17.532 --> 10:20.127
Or you can wait
for Alexis to come to if he does.

10:20.236 --> 10:21.965
By then, this thing could be over.

10:22.071 --> 10:24.506
All right, I'll go along.
I'll send you a team.

10:24.608 --> 10:26.872
Thank you.
Can you pass me back to Tony?

10:26.977 --> 10:29.377
He was going to give me
the number for the safe house.

10:29.481 --> 10:31.677
Yeah. I just spoke to Paulson over there.

10:31.784 --> 10:33.581
He said the girls are sleeping.

10:33.786 --> 10:37.154
Okay, get them to call me back
at my cell when they wake up.

10:37.257 --> 10:38.224
Definitely.

10:38.358 --> 10:39.347
Thank you.

10:39.593 --> 10:40.560
Mason's on board.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.026
That's good.

11:04.691 --> 11:06.386
So what else did Teri say?

11:07.194 --> 11:08.388
She didn't say much.

11:09.029 --> 11:12.796
When she guessed you'd been seeing me,
she didn't want to talk to me.

11:13.501 --> 11:15.163
Not that I blame her.

11:15.771 --> 11:18.969
I couldn't finish the debrief,
so I left and let Paulson do it.

11:19.076 --> 11:20.168
Maybe that was a mistake.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.777
No, you did the right thing.

11:21.878 --> 11:23.744
This is my fault, I should've told her.

11:23.848 --> 11:25.248
Seems she didn't want to talk.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.977
Doesn't matter, I should've told her.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.349
Jack, from what I could see...

11:31.558 --> 11:34.288
...she really loves you
and wants to work it out.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.765
Maybe you want to call her
and see how she is.

11:37.866 --> 11:39.857
I tried, Mason said they were sleeping.

11:43.673 --> 11:46.335
Why don't you call Paulson,
see if they're up yet?

11:52.617 --> 11:53.948
It's not going through.

11:54.052 --> 11:55.110
Might be the area.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.651
Try again when we get to the plaza.

11:58.725 --> 12:00.488
I'm really sorry about all this.

12:01.228 --> 12:02.696
Yeah, me, too.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.260
Hanlin.

12:10.306 --> 12:13.901
Come on, guys, do what you can.
At least try to find somebody else.

12:15.679 --> 12:16.737
Yeah.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.016
I need some extra bodies
to help track Teri and Kim Bauer.

12:22.121 --> 12:23.088
I don't know.

12:23.189 --> 12:25.851
I don't see anyone
doing crossword puzzles down there.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.928
My hands are a little tied
without Nina here.

12:29.029 --> 12:30.690
Because Nina's with Jack, right?

12:32.667 --> 12:33.634
Yeah.

12:36.405 --> 12:39.067
She says it's over between them.
What do you think?

12:39.975 --> 12:40.942
What?

12:41.410 --> 12:42.401
I'm just asking.

12:42.747 --> 12:45.181
I mean, you got to be
wondering yourself, right?

12:46.884 --> 12:49.445
Hey, Almeida, I'm on your side.

12:50.222 --> 12:52.817
Nina ought to be here now.
Why does Jack need her?

12:53.459 --> 12:55.017
You're busting your ass...

12:55.129 --> 12:57.097
...because she took a ride with him.

12:57.198 --> 12:58.426
If that works for you, great.

12:58.532 --> 13:01.730
You know what works for me?
You keeping out of my personal life.

13:01.836 --> 13:05.773
There's entirely too much personal
business going on around here.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.241
I want to get this place back on track.

13:08.345 --> 13:11.405
It seems to me Nina Myers
is a big part of the problem.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.342
How do you figure that?

13:13.650 --> 13:15.950
She covers for everyone
that doesn't follow code.

13:16.055 --> 13:18.523
Everyone who doesn't follow code
covers for her.

13:19.124 --> 13:21.183
She's with Jack, she's with you.

13:21.393 --> 13:24.830
You don't think that's relevant?
You don't think that's a distraction?

13:25.332 --> 13:26.960
No, I don't.

13:27.435 --> 13:29.802
No, you don't. Well, I do.

13:47.058 --> 13:48.618
Patty said you want to talk to me.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.821
Yeah, sit down. Close the door.

13:55.236 --> 13:56.328
What's up?

13:57.572 --> 14:00.770
Before I make my decision
about giving this tape to the DA...

14:00.876 --> 14:02.037
...I wanted to talk to you.

14:02.512 --> 14:03.479
Okay.

14:04.247 --> 14:07.080
I wanted you to understand
what you're up against.

14:07.818 --> 14:10.014
I understand. I'm ready to go.

14:10.122 --> 14:12.454
No. Listen to me.

14:14.192 --> 14:15.660
We're going to the press...

14:15.862 --> 14:18.626
...with a story about some
bad men committing murder...

14:18.831 --> 14:20.322
...and trying to frame you.

14:20.634 --> 14:23.195
But these men are going
to shift the attention to you...

14:23.305 --> 14:26.638
...and your involvement
with Lyle Gibson's death.

14:27.042 --> 14:29.773
Ultimately, they're going
to make this about you.

14:30.146 --> 14:33.082
On television, in the press,
everywhere you go...

14:34.952 --> 14:37.716
...you're going to be accused
of a crime you did not commit.

14:39.123 --> 14:41.388
- Can you live through that?
- Yes, I can.

14:41.627 --> 14:42.959
Don't just say it.

14:44.597 --> 14:46.189
Think about it.

14:48.769 --> 14:49.895
Dad...

14:51.472 --> 14:53.703
...what do you think
I've been living through?

14:54.877 --> 14:57.368
Not just today, but for years.

15:00.383 --> 15:01.681
I made a mistake.

15:03.354 --> 15:05.346
I was wrong to go to Mom and Carl.

15:06.124 --> 15:08.059
I should've come forward right away...

15:08.861 --> 15:11.193
...taken my hits right then and there.

15:12.698 --> 15:13.824
But I was scared.

15:15.536 --> 15:17.060
Well, that's what you learn.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.471
It's okay to be scared.

15:28.652 --> 15:30.586
What I said last night...

15:31.956 --> 15:34.118
...about you not being there...

15:35.961 --> 15:37.429
...it's not true.

15:41.001 --> 15:44.528
It's what I told myself...

15:45.406 --> 15:47.705
...so I can blame you for my screw-up.

15:49.545 --> 15:51.536
Doesn't matter why you said it.

15:51.847 --> 15:54.510
Fact is, there's some truth to it.

15:55.786 --> 15:57.583
I haven't always been there.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.486
But I'm here now.

16:16.278 --> 16:17.973
- Jovan.
- Yes, Andre?

16:18.079 --> 16:20.275
I can't find Alexis.
Have you heard from him?

16:20.383 --> 16:21.351
No.

16:21.652 --> 16:23.984
He's meeting Morgan in 20 minutes.
We must talk.

16:24.087 --> 16:25.247
I don't know, Andre...

16:25.389 --> 16:27.483
...I've got my own situation to deal with.

16:27.659 --> 16:30.526
- Still no sign of the women?
- I'll find them.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.358
You checked the hospitals?

16:32.465 --> 16:35.731
I checked everywhere.
I don't need you looking over my shoulder.

16:36.403 --> 16:39.600
I'll find them and kill them.
Don't worry about it.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.206
Calm down, Jovan.

16:41.309 --> 16:44.746
And don't tell me not to worry.
Just tell me how you plan to find them.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.244
I'm going to the Bauer house.

16:49.786 --> 16:51.515
Eventually someone will show.

17:01.501 --> 17:03.935
- My aunt isn't there.
- Is there anyone else?

17:04.036 --> 17:07.337
I've tried everyone I can think of.
No one's heard from my mom.

17:07.575 --> 17:10.042
Rick, we got things to do.
She's got to go.

17:10.912 --> 17:11.935
What kind of things?

17:12.113 --> 17:13.775
You'll find out when Frank gets here.

17:13.883 --> 17:15.510
What's that supposed to mean?

17:18.188 --> 17:19.917
Kim's in trouble. I got to help her.

17:20.023 --> 17:21.820
Yeah, and we'll be in trouble, too.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.550
Look, she has to leave.

17:23.694 --> 17:24.592
That's fine.

17:24.694 --> 17:25.855
Kim, wait.

17:26.097 --> 17:26.929
Wait.

17:28.401 --> 17:30.835
I just need to talk to her
and then she'll go.

17:36.176 --> 17:37.838
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

17:37.946 --> 17:41.007
A park my parents said to go
in case of an emergency.

17:41.117 --> 17:42.550
Maybe she's there.

17:42.985 --> 17:44.111
Why don't you go home?

17:44.220 --> 17:47.054
No. The people that are after us
probably know where I live.

17:47.157 --> 17:48.989
If she's safe, she's won't go there.

17:49.093 --> 17:50.526
How are you going to get there?

17:50.695 --> 17:51.719
I don't know.

17:53.332 --> 17:55.095
Can I borrow your car?

17:57.236 --> 17:58.794
It's not mine, it's Melanie's.

18:01.409 --> 18:02.603
Wait a minute.

18:12.823 --> 18:14.848
Here. Take this.

18:15.025 --> 18:17.516
You can get a cab
a couple blocks down the street.

18:17.761 --> 18:19.662
Are you sure you can't come with me?

18:19.798 --> 18:22.768
After last night, I got to lay low.
They'll be looking for me.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.369
I still think you should turn yourself in.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.841
It's not that bad.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.204
You helped us escape.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.638
I'm on probation.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.472
They catch me, I'm going to prison.

18:33.682 --> 18:36.014
It doesn't matter what you
or your folks say.

18:38.087 --> 18:40.556
I wish we would've met before this.

18:42.559 --> 18:43.754
So do I.

18:49.968 --> 18:51.492
Are you going to be okay?

18:52.639 --> 18:53.901
Yeah.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.271
I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.748
You wouldn't be in trouble
if it wasn't for me.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.249
That's not true.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.047
Dan would've found someone else.

19:19.606 --> 19:20.470
Hey, Rick.

19:20.573 --> 19:21.540
Hey.

19:22.575 --> 19:23.906
How did it go last night?

19:24.044 --> 19:25.170
Went fine.

19:25.913 --> 19:27.211
Yeah?

19:28.884 --> 19:31.580
Doesn't look fine.
What happened to you?

19:31.687 --> 19:32.677
Nothing, I'm okay.

19:32.855 --> 19:34.186
Hey, Dan!

19:35.324 --> 19:36.348
Dan!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.220
Go, just leave.

19:38.562 --> 19:40.428
- Grab a cab on 4th.
- I know.

19:40.965 --> 19:43.160
- Where's my brother?
- He's out.

19:43.334 --> 19:45.326
- Out where?
- We got separated.

19:47.707 --> 19:49.869
- Where's the money?
- He's got it.

19:51.244 --> 19:53.406
- I should get going.
- Where are you going?

19:53.514 --> 19:55.539
- What do you mean?
- I don't know you.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.914
- My name's Kim.
- Hi, how do you know Rick?

19:58.086 --> 20:01.285
She's a friend from San Diego.
She's got to get back home.

20:01.391 --> 20:03.518
- She's not going.
- What's that mean?

20:03.626 --> 20:06.357
My brother and my money aren't here
and I don't know her.

20:06.464 --> 20:08.432
- She's a friend...
- I understand...

20:08.532 --> 20:10.591
...but I got business here
in half an hour.

20:10.701 --> 20:13.171
Until Dan gets back
with the money, nobody leaves.

20:34.966 --> 20:37.093
The teams will be
in hidden positions...

20:37.201 --> 20:39.432
...here, here, here and here.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.200
- And communications?
- I'll be on the same channel.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.239
Exits?

20:43.375 --> 20:46.278
They'll be covered,
but I'll double up with one here...

20:46.380 --> 20:48.177
- ... at the widest exit.
- Okay, good.

20:51.019 --> 20:51.952
Yeah.

20:52.121 --> 20:53.520
Jack, you all set up?

20:53.656 --> 20:55.318
Yeah. Are the teams in place?

20:55.492 --> 20:57.722
That's what I wanted
to call you about.

20:58.796 --> 21:00.058
Hanlin's running backup.

21:00.231 --> 21:01.698
- What?
- Hang on.

21:01.799 --> 21:04.461
I'm sure it will be fine.
Just avoid a confrontation.

21:04.602 --> 21:06.435
Damn it, how could you let this happen?

21:06.539 --> 21:07.938
Look, Jack, I'm sorry.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.339
I just found out.
Division made the assignment.

21:10.777 --> 21:13.178
Okay, fine. I'll deal with it.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.941
- I don't believe this.
- What?

21:15.082 --> 21:17.074
Teddy Hanlin's in charge of backup.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.719
Seth Campbell's old partner?

21:18.888 --> 21:20.253
- Yeah.
- Great.

21:20.890 --> 21:22.187
Who are you calling?

21:22.391 --> 21:25.520
The safe house. I want to be sure
Teri and Kim are all right.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.191
No one's picking up.
You sure this is the number?

21:30.301 --> 21:31.997
It's the number Paulson gave me.

21:32.104 --> 21:33.765
Why can't I get through?

21:34.373 --> 21:35.431
Jack.

21:36.241 --> 21:39.235
Hey, Jack. I haven't seen you
since you put my partner away.

21:39.347 --> 21:41.042
Teddy, don't start.

21:41.716 --> 21:43.616
Teddy, is your team in place?

21:43.718 --> 21:46.381
Yeah, we're not up here
shopping for Dockers.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.256
I heard you screwed up today.
I guess some people have connections...

21:50.360 --> 21:53.091
...and don't get spanked
when they break the law.

21:53.430 --> 21:55.398
The guy we're looking for
is wearing a red cap.

21:55.499 --> 21:56.761
That's all we know about him.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.268
I'm going to stay visible,
hopefully draw him to me.

21:59.404 --> 22:02.101
No one makes a move
until I give the word, is that clear?

22:02.308 --> 22:05.301
Yeah. It's your show.
Just make sure you stay put when you do.

22:05.412 --> 22:06.674
I always get a bit nervous...

22:06.780 --> 22:09.214
...about target confusion,
and I'd hate to see...

22:09.316 --> 22:11.410
...one of the good guys
go down by mistake.

22:11.787 --> 22:14.051
Teddy, let's get started, okay?

22:14.790 --> 22:15.814
Hey.

22:16.158 --> 22:18.457
I don't want a problem on this.

22:27.439 --> 22:30.533
Hey, I got a call from the Rampart Division.

22:30.643 --> 22:33.407
They got a report that a woman
matching Teri's description...

22:33.514 --> 22:35.243
...was seen in Griffith Park.

22:35.349 --> 22:37.409
It's not far from the safe house.

22:37.552 --> 22:39.679
- Where is she?
- She disappeared.

22:41.856 --> 22:43.323
I'll get on the satellite uplink.

22:43.425 --> 22:45.258
Get someone posted at the Bauer house.

22:45.395 --> 22:47.090
Williams should be there in minutes.

22:47.197 --> 22:48.164
Good work.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.138
I don't like what I'm seeing.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.440
Looks like you've been roughed up
by someone.

23:02.916 --> 23:06.513
Do you think maybe that I hit my head?
That that's why I can't remember?

23:06.855 --> 23:08.015
That's just it.

23:08.190 --> 23:10.853
There's no evidence of a head injury.

23:12.061 --> 23:14.029
Except for your memory loss,
you're coherent.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.495
Beside the bruises,
do you have any other pain?

23:17.969 --> 23:18.936
Yeah.

23:20.071 --> 23:23.404
Something's been bothering me,
sort of here.

23:31.052 --> 23:32.041
Oh, my God.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.478
What do you think happened to me?

23:34.655 --> 23:36.020
I don't know.

23:37.759 --> 23:39.694
But I think you have a condition.

23:39.996 --> 23:42.658
It's called disassociative amnesia,
and it can happen...

23:42.765 --> 23:46.429
...to someone when they suffer
an intense emotional trauma.

23:46.570 --> 23:48.800
Now, we need to get you to a hospital...

23:48.906 --> 23:50.808
...so they can figure out what's going on.

23:50.910 --> 23:52.434
No, I don't want to do that.

23:52.545 --> 23:55.412
I can't explain it,
but for some reason I just...

23:55.515 --> 23:57.916
I don't want to go to a hospital.

23:58.018 --> 24:00.543
I have this gut feeling
that it would be dangerous...

24:00.654 --> 24:02.386
How could it be dangerous?

24:02.490 --> 24:04.959
I'd be by your side the entire time.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.459
Come on, it'll be fine.

24:06.595 --> 24:08.119
No, I don't want to go.

24:08.230 --> 24:10.324
We can't stay here.
You need to get checked out.

24:10.433 --> 24:12.129
Neural damage
could become permanent...

24:12.236 --> 24:13.726
...if it's not treated right away.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.133
No, I don't want to go.

24:15.239 --> 24:17.208
I don't want to go.

24:23.217 --> 24:26.380
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Please don't make me go.

24:26.487 --> 24:29.081
I can't do it.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

24:29.189 --> 24:31.420
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
- Okay.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.993
I can't go.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.766
- Please, Phil, just take me home.
- Okay, it's okay.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.809
Right. I heard.

24:46.278 --> 24:49.874
No, we did much better
in New York than we thought.

24:50.350 --> 24:51.977
Oh, yeah, definitely.

24:53.553 --> 24:55.817
Oh, yeah, that'll make him very happy.

24:57.693 --> 24:58.955
Oh, I think so, too.

24:59.761 --> 25:01.752
The DNC, they'll really milk it.

25:04.601 --> 25:05.590
Yeah.

25:06.536 --> 25:07.868
Well, I...

25:08.105 --> 25:09.835
I'm not sure, but...

25:10.041 --> 25:11.599
Well, that's good, though.

25:11.977 --> 25:16.108
No, I spoke to Chris. I told him we'd be
in Baltimore If we won New York.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.607
Right.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.652
Yeah. Jerry?

25:24.058 --> 25:26.549
Jerry, listen. I got to run.

25:26.728 --> 25:29.163
We'll touch base
in a couple of hours, okay?

25:29.899 --> 25:32.060
Well, how are Beth and the girls?

25:32.335 --> 25:33.393
That's terrific.

25:33.570 --> 25:34.798
All right. Bye-bye.

25:34.971 --> 25:36.030
Patty.

25:36.207 --> 25:38.004
Do you know where David went?

25:38.209 --> 25:39.871
Just down to the conference room.

25:40.145 --> 25:42.340
He and Mike are meeting
with the publicist.

25:42.481 --> 25:44.040
Did he say how long he'd be?

25:45.084 --> 25:46.051
He didn't say.

25:46.152 --> 25:48.382
It shouldn't be more than 15 to 20 minutes.

25:49.022 --> 25:49.990
Okay.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.625
Did you hear about New York?

25:51.726 --> 25:53.626
Yeah. Isn't it great?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.328
There you are.

26:21.429 --> 26:23.227
- Jerry's on the line.
- I'm busy.

26:23.398 --> 26:26.129
- He said he just wanted to...
- Well, I'm busy, Patty.

26:26.436 --> 26:28.097
Tell him I'll call him back.

26:28.738 --> 26:29.797
Okay.

27:09.723 --> 27:11.190
Come on, Dan.

27:19.368 --> 27:21.598
- Where's Keith?
- I don't know.

27:22.506 --> 27:25.202
I heard you two had a talk.

27:25.609 --> 27:26.974
Yes, we did.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.112
You should talk to him, too.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.579
Really? Well, about what?

27:33.418 --> 27:35.216
We're putting him in a tough place.

27:36.556 --> 27:38.183
He's going to need our support.

27:38.558 --> 27:39.957
No, David.

27:41.095 --> 27:44.327
You're the one
who's put him in a tough place.

27:44.499 --> 27:45.761
As for needing us...

27:45.967 --> 27:49.165
...our baby left the nest a long time ago.

27:49.305 --> 27:51.968
I don't think he cares
to hear what I have to say.

27:52.609 --> 27:53.735
That's ridiculous.

27:54.378 --> 27:55.903
Speak to him, Sherry.

28:22.413 --> 28:24.075
I destroyed it.

28:28.254 --> 28:29.482
You destroyed the tape?

28:37.498 --> 28:39.489
And I know you're going to be angry...

28:39.667 --> 28:40.998
...but it had to be done.

28:43.439 --> 28:46.409
You have blinders on.
You're not seeing this thing very clearly.

28:55.287 --> 28:57.279
It's for the best.

29:13.476 --> 29:15.240
It breaks my heart...

29:16.747 --> 29:18.339
...that I was right.

29:20.418 --> 29:21.613
Right...

29:22.421 --> 29:24.048
...about what, David?

29:31.532 --> 29:34.023
That wasn't the real tape, Sherry.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.835
I've learned that I don't know you
as well as I thought I did.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.750
I had to see just how far
you were willing to go.

29:55.395 --> 29:58.660
I will do anything...

30:00.067 --> 30:02.502
...to protect my family, David.

30:04.907 --> 30:06.135
Anything.

30:09.612 --> 30:12.775
Does that make me a bad person?

30:22.462 --> 30:24.589
I want you to set up a press conference.

30:24.798 --> 30:26.663
- When?
- Now.

30:26.767 --> 30:28.929
We've got one coming up
in less than three hours.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.164
I want this one within the hour.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.364
- Where?
- Downstairs.

30:33.475 --> 30:37.174
I don't want anything to interfere
with what I have to say.

31:03.613 --> 31:05.376
I'm on Channel 1. Do you copy?

31:05.515 --> 31:07.575
I hear you, Jack. The signal's good.

31:07.918 --> 31:09.154
Where are you posted?

31:09.721 --> 31:12.383
Just under the east entrance,
right under the bridge.

31:13.058 --> 31:14.117
Good.

31:15.227 --> 31:16.421
How about you, Teddy?

31:17.063 --> 31:19.430
My teams are in position.

31:21.035 --> 31:22.468
Okay, I got you.

31:29.912 --> 31:31.540
You're blocking my view.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.775
Take a couple of steps back.

31:35.753 --> 31:36.742
How's that?

31:37.955 --> 31:40.447
There you go. Perfect shot.

31:41.594 --> 31:42.561
Okay.

31:46.967 --> 31:48.195
There you go, ma'am.

31:49.069 --> 31:50.366
Thank you.

31:50.871 --> 31:54.240
You're a very sensitive guy, Jack.
I've never seen that side of you.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.037
Drop it, Teddy. We're working.

31:56.378 --> 31:59.006
Jack can walk and chew gum
at the same time.

31:59.115 --> 32:00.174
Can't you, Jack?

32:00.283 --> 32:01.443
What do you want?

32:01.551 --> 32:03.816
Nothing. It's just that
we're both so busy...

32:03.921 --> 32:06.014
...we never really get a chance to talk.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.392
Did you hear
about Seth Campbell's wife, Judy?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.020
No. What about her?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.290
She hung herself.

32:14.401 --> 32:17.370
Yeah. Happened a couple of weeks ago.

32:17.471 --> 32:19.736
I guess you didn't get the memo?

32:19.941 --> 32:22.375
It was a real tragedy.
She didn't even leave a note.

32:23.211 --> 32:25.237
I guess she thought
it was kind of obvious...

32:25.348 --> 32:28.079
...trying to raise four kids
with a husband in prison...

32:28.185 --> 32:31.677
...and no pension. Because why, Jack?

32:31.788 --> 32:35.657
You busted him for lining his pocket
with a few extra dollars?

32:36.027 --> 32:37.655
Look, I am sorry about Judy...

32:37.763 --> 32:40.665
...and I'm sorry about his kids,
but this is not the time.

32:40.767 --> 32:42.826
That's right, you're busy.

32:44.604 --> 32:46.368
Can this wait, Teddy?

32:46.541 --> 32:47.736
Of course.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.242
I just thought it would be nice...

32:49.344 --> 32:51.904
...to, you know, catch up
while we're hanging.

32:52.849 --> 32:55.181
Teddy, I understand why you're upset.

32:55.518 --> 32:58.886
If you want, when this is over,
I'll be happy to talk with you...

32:58.989 --> 33:00.787
...and tell you my side of the story.

33:00.892 --> 33:04.259
I'd really like to hear your side
of the story, Jack.

33:04.529 --> 33:06.521
Why don't we go to a Starbucks...

33:06.732 --> 33:10.362
...get a couple of cappuccinos
and we can have a little chin-wag?

33:17.445 --> 33:18.639
CTU. Mason.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.841
- George, we have a problem.
- What's that?

33:20.951 --> 33:22.782
Teddy's on the open channel hassling Jack.

33:22.886 --> 33:25.354
He's got a rifle
and this place is crawling with people.

33:25.455 --> 33:28.152
It's too late to swap him out.
This is going down soon.

33:28.292 --> 33:29.691
We have to do something.

33:29.794 --> 33:31.854
- What channel are you on?
- Channel 1.

33:31.964 --> 33:33.023
Hang on.

33:38.271 --> 33:39.239
Yeah.

33:39.340 --> 33:41.365
Want to conference me in
on Channel 1?

33:41.475 --> 33:42.704
Sure.

33:47.617 --> 33:48.606
Hanlin, it's Mason.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.285
What's the matter with you?

33:50.419 --> 33:52.217
You got a problem with Jack, bury it.

33:52.356 --> 33:54.416
You realize how many agents
we've lost today?

33:54.525 --> 33:57.255
You're in an uncontained area.
We don't know what we've got.

33:57.362 --> 33:59.593
So let's get on the same page now.

33:59.732 --> 34:00.699
Yes, sir.

34:00.866 --> 34:02.390
- Jack, you okay?
- Yeah.

34:02.501 --> 34:04.060
Okay. Let's get back to work.

34:31.972 --> 34:32.938
Hello?

34:33.473 --> 34:35.065
Yeah, man, it's cool. He'll be here.

35:12.823 --> 35:16.122
CTU, this is Williams.
I've arrived at the Bauer house.

35:16.226 --> 35:17.921
Checking perimeter.

36:01.682 --> 36:03.013
Is this my neighborhood?

36:03.117 --> 36:04.416
Not quite.

36:05.422 --> 36:06.855
We'll be there soon.

36:10.326 --> 36:12.318
Rick says he and Dan got separated.

36:12.563 --> 36:14.190
No, he'll be here soon.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.290
He knows we need the cash by 7:00.

36:21.707 --> 36:24.404
- What happens when Dan doesn't show up?
- I don't know.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.074
I'm not going to tell him his brother's dead.

36:27.215 --> 36:28.614
Why not? You didn't do it.

36:28.716 --> 36:30.013
He's going to find out.

36:30.118 --> 36:31.347
Not from me.

36:33.856 --> 36:34.788
What?

36:35.424 --> 36:36.686
I don't understand.

36:36.892 --> 36:39.021
Neither do I. Doing this deal is suicide.

36:39.230 --> 36:42.256
I'm not talking about the deal.
I'm talking about you.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.734
What do you mean?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.599
You have so much going for you.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.173
You're smart, you're good-looking,
you're funny.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.639
How did you end up like this?

36:50.510 --> 36:52.206
- I'm doing all right.
- All right?

36:52.346 --> 36:53.836
You're wanted by the police.

36:53.948 --> 36:55.245
You got shot in the arm.

36:55.349 --> 36:57.614
Your friends you hang out with
are criminals.

36:58.086 --> 36:59.987
Do you really want to end up here?

37:00.156 --> 37:03.353
I do the best I can.
I didn't grow up like you did.

37:03.593 --> 37:05.858
That's just an excuse.

37:06.296 --> 37:07.957
I have a friend named Todd.

37:08.265 --> 37:10.291
He went through two foster homes.

37:10.468 --> 37:12.528
He got a scholarship to Stanford now.

37:12.671 --> 37:14.662
Good for Todd.
Why didn't you go to his house?

37:14.773 --> 37:16.240
He can't help me find my mom.

37:16.342 --> 37:17.810
Neither can I.

37:20.814 --> 37:22.214
Look, I know you're right.

37:22.617 --> 37:24.643
If I get the chance,
I'll turn myself around.

37:24.753 --> 37:26.084
But this thing is what it is.

37:26.188 --> 37:28.088
We have to find a way to get through it.

37:28.190 --> 37:29.748
Get through it? This is crazy.

37:29.858 --> 37:32.454
You can't let Frank make a drug deal
without any money.

37:32.563 --> 37:34.087
We're not going to get through this.

37:34.198 --> 37:35.825
We'll get stuck in the middle of it.

37:36.033 --> 37:37.365
You've got to talk to him.

37:37.636 --> 37:39.433
Hey, stud. Think fast.

37:39.604 --> 37:40.730
Thanks.

37:41.006 --> 37:43.237
So, what deal?

37:46.580 --> 37:50.209
We're going to take the $20,000
you made last night and buy some ecstasy.

37:50.552 --> 37:52.383
- Dan didn't tell you?
- No.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.512
I'll flip it to these guys from Redondo.

37:54.623 --> 37:55.920
They'll pay $50,000 for it.

37:57.827 --> 37:59.385
What happens if Dan doesn't show up?

37:59.629 --> 38:00.653
Hey.

38:00.964 --> 38:02.932
If Dan says he'll be here, he'll be here.

38:21.556 --> 38:23.787
Someone get these kids out of here.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.391
Station 1, that's you.

38:25.561 --> 38:27.154
Roger. I'm on it.

38:59.269 --> 39:01.135
Hold up. I think I got him.

39:22.967 --> 39:23.991
Hey.

39:43.124 --> 39:44.149
Alexis?

39:44.593 --> 39:45.457
Yeah.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.420
I told you, inside the restaurant.

39:48.531 --> 39:49.965
We're doing it out here.

39:50.100 --> 39:50.930
Why?

39:51.034 --> 39:54.994
There's a cop inside the restaurant.
Come on, let's get this over with.

39:57.676 --> 39:58.734
Fine.

39:59.712 --> 40:01.111
Where's the money?

40:01.513 --> 40:03.414
First, let's go over it again.

40:03.650 --> 40:04.582
Over what?

40:04.784 --> 40:06.309
What you're supposed to do for me.

40:08.956 --> 40:12.723
At 7:20 tonight, I'm going to shut down
the power on Grid 26, GG.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.955
Five minutes later, it comes back up.

40:17.501 --> 40:18.593
What else?

40:18.936 --> 40:20.631
What do you mean, "what else"?

40:24.776 --> 40:26.334
What happened to your accent?

40:29.014 --> 40:30.141
You're not Alexis.

40:30.250 --> 40:31.615
He's moving!

40:31.952 --> 40:33.442
Station 2, what do you see?

40:40.896 --> 40:42.022
I got him.

40:44.601 --> 40:45.761
I can take him.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.836
No. He's not a threat. I can get him.

40:48.171 --> 40:49.299
All teams, hold your fire.

40:49.407 --> 40:51.671
He's going over the east bridge.
Cover the exits.

40:51.777 --> 40:53.404
I'll slow him down for you.

40:53.512 --> 40:54.877
Don't shoot!

40:55.447 --> 40:56.574
I'm going to put him down.

40:56.682 --> 40:58.843
I repeat, do not shoot.
Nobody shoot!

40:58.951 --> 41:00.249
Relax, Jack.

41:00.354 --> 41:01.252
I'll just wing him.

41:01.355 --> 41:02.721
Do not shoot!

41:04.292 --> 41:05.987
Teddy, stand down!

41:07.295 --> 41:08.284
No!

41:12.869 --> 41:14.996
Stay back!

41:15.973 --> 41:17.998
Get me a medic down here now!

41:18.176 --> 41:20.974
Hanlin, you son of a bitch,
I said, don't shoot!

41:21.646 --> 41:23.138
Take care of this.

41:25.051 --> 41:26.109
Stay back!

41:27.053 --> 41:29.784
Suspect's down.
I repeat, suspect is down.

41:29.890 --> 41:32.120
We need EMTs at the east end of the plaza.

41:38.501 --> 41:39.968
This is your house.
