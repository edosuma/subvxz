00:09.926 --> 00:13.388
[Alexa] It had been six weeks
since the breakup, and my mom was right.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.850
Time did help,
and I was starting to feel better.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.562
I didn't look it,
but not because I was post breakup.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.231
Because I was pre-midterms.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.735
Hey, honey. Um...

00:27.110 --> 00:29.529
Why don't you, uh,
let me wash the pajamas?

00:29.696 --> 00:32.657
I can see every meal you've had
since yesterday's breakfast.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.493
Mom, I'm studying.
Who cares what I look like?

00:35.994 --> 00:36.995
I kinda do.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.374
[excitedly] Hey, everybody! I'm home.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.043
[Alexa and Lucas uninterested]
Hi.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.172
I'm happy to see you. Hi!

00:48.339 --> 00:51.217
They're happy too.
Uh, they're just busy.

00:52.635 --> 00:56.431
Yeah, look at how hard Alexa's studying
for her midterms.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.975
How hard Lucas is eating.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.188
All I have left to study for
is cooking class.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.731
And I'm doing that right now.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.816
I helped Mom make breakfast.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.777
He got the eggs out of the fridge.

01:10.653 --> 01:13.865
Hey, Lex, just to give you a heads up,
Dylan's coming over later.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.575
Seriously?

01:15.658 --> 01:18.620
Okay, I've been going out of my way
to avoid him at school,

01:18.703 --> 01:19.996
and now you bring him here?

01:20.330 --> 01:23.917
Sorry, he's my best friend and I've kept
away from him as long as I can.

01:26.127 --> 01:26.961
All right.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.548
Just tell me when he's gonna be here,
so I can be somewhere else.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.633
Now.

01:33.968 --> 01:38.807
Dylan! What a fun surprise!

01:39.557 --> 01:40.934
Excuse me. [sighs]

01:48.441 --> 01:50.527
-That wasn't weird, was it?
-No, I'm good.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.531
Anyway, I'm glad that you came over
'cause this is big.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.242
I'm picking guys for my band
and I need an answer today.

01:57.992 --> 01:58.827
Are you in?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.161
I'm not in.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.539
You sound unsure. Let's talk about it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.544
Do we say "hi" or shun him?

02:08.378 --> 02:10.547
Well, technically she broke up with him.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.007
Only 'cause he hadn't thought about
what would happen to them

02:13.091 --> 02:15.093
-when he leaves for college.
-Which is bad.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.053
So we shun.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.516
I'm gonna walk right past him,
not say a word.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.727
I'm going to give him the stink eye
from here. [sniffs]

02:28.773 --> 02:32.485
-Uh, hi, Mr. Mendoza--
-Hey, Dylan! How are you? Bring it in!

02:34.362 --> 02:35.613
[Dylan] Ah, I'm great.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.492
-How are you?
-Very well, thank you.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.913
Show him how to shun.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.041
Hi, Mrs. Mendoza!

02:47.542 --> 02:49.836
Hey, sweetie!
Help yourself to some breakfast.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.214
At least I didn't hug him.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.136

02:58.803 --> 03:01.806

03:31.461 --> 03:32.295
Woo!

03:33.713 --> 03:36.007
Are you solving a crime
or did you commit one?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.176
Yeah, I know this looks crazy.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.720
But I added more shifts at Wired
for the money I need

03:40.803 --> 03:42.972
to make the London deadline,
and with midterms this week,

03:43.097 --> 03:44.182
I need to cram in studying.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.644
So this covers school work chores
and spontaneously hanging with friends.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.938
I'll tell you more about it
when we hang out at 2:15.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.148
So, uh...

03:52.857 --> 03:53.691
yeah, not crazy.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.613
Potato disagrees.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.282
Potato barks at the oven.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.827
Oh, hmm. This is totally working.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.413
Okay, and my mom still doesn't know
that I work at Wired

04:07.497 --> 04:10.833
because all of my shifts are listed
as study groups.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.877
I think it's time you tell your mom.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.089
I was going to,
but then she got jury duty.

04:16.297 --> 04:20.051
Then Jack broke his arm, then she made
the final cut for a mouthwash focus group.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.553
You know, it was like
the universe was saying,

04:23.429 --> 04:24.389
"She's distracted.

04:24.847 --> 04:25.807
Why tell her now?"

04:28.017 --> 04:29.644
Katie, you can't keep this up.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.062
Sure I can!

04:31.187 --> 04:33.648
In fact, I am 35 seconds ahead.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.984
So, let's relax and catch up. [chuckles]

04:36.651 --> 04:39.153
So... tell me about you.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.865
Well, Dylan came over to see Lucas.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.910
It's the first time I'd seen him
since we broke up.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.454
Oh my gosh. That must've been so weird.

04:48.997 --> 04:49.956
Yeah, really weird.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.917
-[Jennifer] Katie!
-Oh, help me lie to my Mom. [chuckles]

04:53.626 --> 04:57.046
Hi, I'm heading out to do some shopping.
Can you keep an eye on Jack?

04:57.297 --> 05:00.591
He's trying to scratch under his cast
with a shish kebab skewer.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.219
Uh, sure.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.470
Wow!

05:05.388 --> 05:09.142
So many study groups.
Somebody's acing her midterms.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.146
-Yeah, you bet I am.
-You always do.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.607
I don't know why this time
would be any different. [chuckles]

05:18.318 --> 05:19.444
[katie chuckles]

05:19.652 --> 05:22.447
Why would it? Getting straight A's
means everything to me.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.991
And she knows it means everything to me.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.826
[groans then sighs]

05:26.993 --> 05:28.995
It's okay! Breathe.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.748
Deeply.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.752
Because you just said you'd watch Jack
and you've a shift at Wired in 20 minutes.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.715
Oh! Yes, yes, I do! Okay.
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be fine.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.425
You're putting pants on your pants.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.554
Yes. Yes I am.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.016
Oh, you didn't rinse it.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.977
I can't keep having this conversation.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.773
-When I'm gone, you're just don't rinse.
-That's right.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.985
I wish I could pick all of you guys
to be in the band.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.322
And I could,
but I'm only going to pick two of you.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.825
So tell me,
what instruments do you guys play?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.827
I play guitar, bass keys and drums.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.121
I play all that, plus alto sax.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.792
Steve plays guitar and I just downloaded
a piano app.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.796
But does it matter? With you
as our front man it's gonna be awesome.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.963
Awesome!

06:22.090 --> 06:23.466
The choice is pretty clear.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.968
You two need to leave.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.138
You two are in the band!

06:29.639 --> 06:30.556
I'm psyched!

06:30.807 --> 06:33.768
This has been my lifelong dream
since I saw your flyer posted last week.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.230
-Thank you so much. You rule!
-Rule!

06:38.773 --> 06:40.024
So what instruments do you play?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.069
Let's go back to how I rule.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.991
[Jack laughs hysterically]

06:49.075 --> 06:50.910
Oh, it's so awesome.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.829
Oh no, pachow!

06:53.246 --> 06:56.749
Oh, ha-ha! Oh, awesome!

06:57.125 --> 06:58.709
Where's that kid's owner?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.336
Oh, I'll take care of it.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.672
-I'm great with kids.
-[Jack continues laughing]

07:02.755 --> 07:05.675
[in a really threatening voice]
Be quiet or I will end you.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.139
Oh! Hey, what are you guys doing here?

07:11.305 --> 07:14.308
Well, we have to study anyway,
so why not study here with you?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.519
Yeah, no, I can't study at work.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.981
Right. That's why we're
just normal paying customers

07:20.064 --> 07:22.066
who happen to be busy studying,

07:22.150 --> 07:25.069
and may want to talk to their barrista
about it occasionally.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.948
Regan's covering history, I have English,

07:29.031 --> 07:31.367
Ryan will run lines with you
for acting class,

07:31.451 --> 07:32.994
and Hannah's babysitting Jack.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.830
A cast?

07:36.581 --> 07:37.623
Bold choice.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.333
I almost wore an eyepatch.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.254
Ha-ha! Awesome!

07:46.048 --> 07:47.508
Thank you. For helping.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.719
"Hark! She speaks.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.221
I'll set down what comes from her

07:52.305 --> 07:54.515
to satisfy my remembrance
the more strongly."

07:56.476 --> 07:59.103
Umm...

07:59.729 --> 08:00.813
Okay, um...

08:00.897 --> 08:04.317
"Out, damn spot. Out I say! One, two..."

08:04.442 --> 08:07.612
...or three pumps of mocha, sir?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.530
Uh, two please, miss.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.783
Okay. And then I say...

08:12.909 --> 08:15.953
"One, two. Why? Then 'tis time to do it."

08:17.497 --> 08:18.372
Is that right?

08:18.748 --> 08:20.333
'Tis, fair lady.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.877
[clears throat]

08:23.211 --> 08:25.379
-Can I get you anything else?
-Oh, I'd love some more--

08:25.463 --> 08:26.589
How may I help you?

08:27.548 --> 08:31.135
Yeah, I was just looking at my coffee
and I was wondering if you knew

08:31.302 --> 08:33.304
who organized
the Seneca Falls Convention.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.058
-Um...
-[clears throat]

08:37.266 --> 08:41.062
-Elllizzz...
-Elizabeth Cady Stanton! Yes!

08:42.438 --> 08:43.397
I'd still love a...

08:46.150 --> 08:48.277
Can you show me where the cinnamon is

08:48.361 --> 08:51.280
and the grammatical error
in this sentence?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.199
Yeah, well I have no idea
where the cinnamon is,

08:53.282 --> 08:55.576
and the grammatical error is right...
there!

08:56.035 --> 08:58.246
-Bam! Woo!
-Yeah!

08:58.454 --> 08:59.539
[katie chuckles]

08:59.872 --> 09:04.377
Oh, I'm just high-fiving Katie
because the lattes here are so dang good.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.963
Yelp it or shut it.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.387
[both] See?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.849
Dave, Lori, I need your help.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.268
What did you just call us?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.979
Just trying something out.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.815
I can't have my fans know I have parents.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.734
-Fans.
-Hmm.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.320
Hook me up!

09:31.612 --> 09:34.073
-Why are your jeans so tight?
-Ah!

09:34.865 --> 09:36.242
These are my show pants.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.996
Why? Because they show everything?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.749
[knock on door]

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
That's the guys. Dad, pick up the pace.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.716
-Mom, can you grab my shades?
-I'm not gonna grab your shades!

09:51.882 --> 09:54.176
That's the last time
I pick up the pace for you, pal.

09:55.344 --> 09:58.556
Wait. When did our sweet boy
become so full of himself?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.349
You think those guys
are feeding his ego?

10:00.474 --> 10:02.393
No, Lucas wouldn't buy into that.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.607
Dude, this too tight jean look
is dope!

10:07.773 --> 10:09.317
-You're a genius.
-Genius!

10:10.526 --> 10:14.488
Let's go talk band stuff in my room.
That's right. You get to see my room.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.783
[audience laughing]

10:31.005 --> 10:33.299
-Yeah, that's definitely those two.
-Yeah.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.259
Especially the one that talks.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.639
We've done a commendable job
with Lucas for 17 years.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.224
A couple hours and it gets undone
by those two goobers.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.602
Ugh! You know he's almost an adult!

10:44.894 --> 10:46.937
We only have a little bit of time to...

10:47.063 --> 10:49.273
mold our son into a respectable human.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.150
The Jell-O isn't solid yet.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.903
Did you just call Lucas "Jell-O"?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.405
I'm not the enemy, Lori.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.704
-The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896.
-[softly] Yes.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.168
-That sentence requires a semicolon.
-Perfect!

11:10.544 --> 11:12.963
"I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.591
For it must seem their guilt."

11:16.425 --> 11:18.719
-And scene!
-Haha, thank you!

11:18.928 --> 11:23.099
Thank you. You do not know what it means
to me to serve...

11:23.349 --> 11:25.017
you and wipe down your tables.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.144
Thank you. The service was delightful.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.190
Hannah! We're done.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.110
I don't want to ruin anything.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.530
You're going to love it
when they save the Galaxy!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.868
It's pretty slow. Take a break.

11:43.285 --> 11:47.665
A break? At last,
a chance to do some studying!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.044
Just... one subject left.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.755
-Oh, which one? How can I help?
-Oy. [sighs]

11:55.756 --> 11:57.508
-Precalculus.
-I'm out.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.511
I know, I know it's so complicated,

12:01.178 --> 12:03.806
but I just need to focus, and...

12:05.099 --> 12:05.933
I'm out.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.020
C'mon, you're great at math!
You tell me all the time.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.565
-[softly] All the time.
-[Katie sighs]

12:12.940 --> 12:16.777
No, I've just been so busy
that I've fallen behind.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.780
Which is so unlike me
because I'm great at math.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.826
I do say that all the time.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.746
What am I going to do?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.457
-[Katie sighs]
-Well...

12:29.832 --> 12:33.210
there is someone I know
who could help you.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.547
No, I can't ask you to ask Dylan.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.050
You need help. Straight A's, remember?

12:40.384 --> 12:42.052
It would be too awkward.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.513
I'm already searching for his number.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.683
Yeah, I changed his contact name
after we broke up.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.852
Yeah, here it is. Hmm.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.812
Yikes!

12:53.481 --> 12:54.440
Yeah...

12:54.899 --> 12:56.317
I was mad that day.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.447
Hey, thank you. Okay,
if Dylan can teach me pre-calc,

13:01.655 --> 13:04.325
then I'll be totally ready for midterms!
[chuckles]

13:04.784 --> 13:07.077
Man, this week is starting
to really look up.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.956
I don't know who did it,
but the toilet's clogged.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.376
Also, uh, your phone's missing.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.343
Jack said you guys really had fun today.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.679
I can't believe you got him to spend
that much time at the library.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.516
Oh, yeah, that's right. The library.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.267
[giggles] We had a great time.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.645
Yeah, I love to read.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.480
[audience laughing]

13:36.816 --> 13:38.484
I love to read twice that much.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.323
Let's go, Jack. The senior center tap show
starts in 10 minutes.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.742
Oh! I hope I'm still tapping when I'm old.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.495
Or, taking a long break

13:49.578 --> 13:52.122
and then picking it up again
when you're old.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.709
[door closes]

13:56.502 --> 13:58.879
Yeah, I lied to my mom, Potato.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.923
You drink out of the toilet.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.342
[audience laughing]

14:04.844 --> 14:05.803
Hey!

14:06.262 --> 14:08.264
Just thought I'd stop by.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.851
You know, just to make sure
Dylan shows up. [clears throat]

14:12.393 --> 14:16.188
Oh, thanks! Got my book out
and ready to go.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.190
[gasps] Oh!

14:21.944 --> 14:23.195
Are you wearing lipstick?

14:23.779 --> 14:25.114
Yeah, my lips are chapped.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.325
And makeup.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.744
Chapped face.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.830
[knock on door]

14:38.335 --> 14:41.213
Hey, Dylan. Thank you so much
for helping me out.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.799
Of course! Alexa texted it was important.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.303
I mean, I think it was Alexa.
I changed her name in my phone.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.100
Oh! Hi.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.687
Dylan! I forgot you were coming.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.523
Yeah, I'm just stopping by
before I go out.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.400
To my plans.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.402
I have plans.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.196
Cool.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.992
[clears throat]
Well, Katie, we should get started.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.827
Because I also...

15:12.494 --> 15:13.746
-have plans.
-Oh.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.123
That are... planned.

15:16.999 --> 15:17.875
Oh.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.711
Ah, good. Yeah. Um...

15:20.794 --> 15:24.590
Okay. The derivative equations
are sort of complicated here.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.300
Here's a glass of water, Katie.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.637
Oh, Dylan, I forgot that you were here.
[chuckles]

15:31.138 --> 15:33.098
It's okay! I won't be here long.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.726
You know, my plans.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.561
That are big. [chuckles]

15:38.646 --> 15:42.650
Precalculus, huh?
And I mean "huh," because...

15:42.900 --> 15:44.109
I don't understand it.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.573
I knew you'd come around.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.450
Well, you made a good point.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.161
From now on...
kids are doing the dishes.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.245
[clink]

15:56.455 --> 15:59.249
Yo, D-Dog! Low rider!

15:59.333 --> 16:01.627
-[Lucas] Ha-ha.
-OK, that's it.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.129
Hey, honey, um...

16:04.296 --> 16:06.924
-Listen, we need to talk.
-Oh, yeah, we do.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.636
I'm going to get my teeth whitened,
so if you can stop serving red stuff,

16:10.803 --> 16:11.845
that'd be lit.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.807
Okay, wait, wait. Lucas! Come here.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.016
Um...

16:17.184 --> 16:18.978
I don't know how to say this, um--

16:19.061 --> 16:21.689
The guys are sucking up to you.
Everything they say is a lie.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.732
Yeah, honey.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.694
They're just excited to be in a band,
so they tell you what you wanna hear.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.028
You let it all go to your head.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.155
Hey, guys, come on down.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.033
The guys wouldn't lie to me.
I'll show you.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.749
Okay, so my parents think
you're telling me what I want to hear

16:40.833 --> 16:42.918
just 'cause you're excited
to be in my band.

16:43.002 --> 16:43.919
What?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.964
No way! We tell you you're awesome
because you are awes...

16:48.298 --> 16:51.218
I can't do this anymore!
These stupid pants are killing me!

16:52.720 --> 16:55.222
Oh, wow.
Steve, can you believe this guy?

16:55.723 --> 16:56.557
I can.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.686
I mean, I don't like your songs,
or the band name or these pants.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.314
I actually have a lot of creative concerns
about the direction you're taking us.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.858
[audience laughing]

17:06.191 --> 17:07.443
But I like your shoes.

17:08.485 --> 17:09.361
Me too.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.864
Just not the ones you're wearing
right now.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.034
Okay.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.536
Okay. Yeah, I get it, uh...

17:18.162 --> 17:20.414
Band hangout's over.
You guys should go.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.464
[sighs] You were right.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.467
Honey, it's tough.
But, you know, you learned your lesson.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.262
Hmph, I totally did. My ideas are terrible
and I'm nothing special.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.682
Where are you going?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.893
To freeze to death.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.648
-I think we parented too hard.
-[huffs]

17:53.072 --> 17:56.241

that sounds amazing!

17:56.450 --> 17:58.035
-Dylan's gone.
-Thank God!

17:58.118 --> 18:00.120
[audience laughing]

18:01.955 --> 18:02.915
See?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.501
I told you it wouldn't be awkward.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.712
No, no. Not awkward at all.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.715
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry.

18:13.008 --> 18:13.842
Thanks.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.262
When I saw him this morning,
he was wearing that...

18:17.679 --> 18:21.475
cute shirt and I was wearing
my last three meals.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.562
I overheard him tell my dad
he was doing great.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.231
Great?

18:27.981 --> 18:31.026
Who says "great"? It's so braggy.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
I know.

18:33.237 --> 18:37.866
So when he agreed to tutor you,
I took the opportunity to show him that...

18:38.158 --> 18:39.284
I'm great too.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.953
Well, it totally worked.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.454
Okay, you looked amazing.

18:43.080 --> 18:43.914
Thanks.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.293
I used, like, 17 different products.
I don't know how Lucas does this everyday.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.672
Thank you for asking Dylan.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.009
I can't believe it, but I'm actually ready
for all of my midterms.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.346
And I'm ready to change Dylan's name
in my phone.

18:59.429 --> 19:03.225
Hmm. Yow! That is still not his name.

Listen, everybody likes hearing
nice things about themselves, Lucas.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.067
And there are plenty of them
to say about you.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.528

23:58.103 --> 23:59.479
I don't have $2,000.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.274
[huffs] You know...

24:03.525 --> 24:05.652
I have... always trusted you.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.363
And now, I don't know what to think.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.116
I'm sorry, Mom.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.785
You should be. I'm disappointed.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.289
Yeah, you should be.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.128
[whimpers] I'm also proud of you.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.049
You figured out a way to make this work
instead of giving up.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.553
Hmm. That's what you do every day.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.683
Don't make me cry! I'm still mad at you.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.393
[chuckles]

24:39.644 --> 24:40.479
[sniffles]

24:42.147 --> 24:43.023
[sighs]

24:44.691 --> 24:47.277
I'll see if I can find a little money
somewhere to help.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.696
[sniffs] Maybe we can sell Potato.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.532
[both giggle]

24:53.074 --> 24:56.453
Wait. So... you're not going to punish me?

24:56.745 --> 24:58.038
Oh, I'm gonna punish you.

24:58.955 --> 25:02.542
But, it's been a while, so, I need to
come up with something really good.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.962
-I believe in you.
-[both chuckle]

25:07.797 --> 25:12.427
[in British accent] So, Governor, draw me
more about this trip to London Town.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.764
That is why Alexa doesn't like
when I do that!

25:16.097 --> 25:16.973
Oh my...

25:18.058 --> 25:21.269
[in British accent] Why not join
in some gibberish with me, good mom?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.271
Why not, you big cup of tea?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.566
-Big cup of tea? I can get you one now.
-That'd be...

25:58.682 --> 26:00.600
