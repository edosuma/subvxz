-Charlie.
-Hey.

21:49.780 --> 21:51.483
Millennia ago,

21:51.518 --> 21:54.750
the gods came to Earth
and gifted humanity

21:54.785 --> 21:57.522
with the greenstone
of immense power.

21:58.888 --> 22:02.153
With it we were able
to build incredible stargates

22:02.188 --> 22:04.925
to harness
the energy of the universe.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.666
But that power to create

22:09.701 --> 22:12.669
was also a power
that could destroy.

22:14.002 --> 22:16.035
So the gods
chose my brother,

22:16.070 --> 22:18.609
my sister, and myself

22:18.644 --> 22:20.644
and imbued us
with the stone's essence

22:20.679 --> 22:22.778
to protect humankind.

22:23.847 --> 22:26.815
We were
the first trio of light.

22:26.850 --> 22:30.456
Combining into a force
greater than ourselves.

22:33.758 --> 22:37.463
But such power corrupts,
as it always does.

22:37.832 --> 22:39.828
And my sister
became obsessed

22:39.863 --> 22:42.468
with not merely
serving the gods,

22:42.503 --> 22:43.931
but becoming
one of them.

22:45.165 --> 22:47.033
When she was denied,

22:47.068 --> 22:49.200
she sought her revenge.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.038
She attempted
to steal the stone,

22:52.073 --> 22:53.842
the source
of our power,

22:53.877 --> 22:56.977
and use it
to create a force of chaos.

23:01.687 --> 23:03.951
My brother and I
had no choice

23:03.986 --> 23:05.084
but to confront her,

23:05.119 --> 23:06.789
but we were too late.

23:07.224 --> 23:10.056
The power
of the stone had consumed her.

23:10.091 --> 23:12.498
And she was
pregnant with a child

23:12.533 --> 23:15.765
prophesized
to bring about the Apocalypse.

23:19.133 --> 23:22.035
My brother and I could not
bear to kill our sister.

23:22.570 --> 23:25.236
So we sealed her,
still pregnant,

23:25.271 --> 23:29.240
in the catacombs
of the long lost Temple.

23:29.275 --> 23:32.650
She was entombed there
for a thousand years.

23:32.685 --> 23:34.817
And she was freed
by an explorer

23:34.852 --> 23:38.854
who had no idea
the evil he was unleashing.

23:39.725 --> 23:41.560
Not just my sister,

23:41.595 --> 23:44.222
but the child
she bore, Drake.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.126
The Maya Apocalypse
made flesh.

23:47.595 --> 23:50.767
Now the only way
to stop them

23:50.802 --> 23:53.770
is to form
a new trio of light

23:53.805 --> 23:55.167

most people
