WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.339
- Ross kissed me.
- No!

00:07.549 --> 00:09.842
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:10.010 --> 00:11.510
It was unbelievable!

00:11.720 --> 00:14.763
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:14.973 --> 00:16.390
We wanna hear everything.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.600
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.436
- Okay.
- Rachel.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.896
Does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

00:23.106 --> 00:26.275
- Oh, it ended very well.
- Oh.

00:26.484 --> 00:29.361
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

00:29.571 --> 00:32.238
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.867
Was it like a soft brush
against your lips...

00:35.035 --> 00:38.704
...or was it like a, you know,
"I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

00:38.913 --> 00:43.250
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...

00:43.418 --> 00:46.295
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.674
Oh... So, okay, was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

00:50.842 --> 00:54.386
No, actually, ahem, first
they started out on my waist...

00:54.554 --> 00:57.181
...and then they slid up
and then they were in my hair.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.599
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.602
And, uh...

01:01.770 --> 01:02.978
And then I kissed her.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.271
Tongue?

01:04.438 --> 01:06.023
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.073
All right, check out this bad boy!

01:56.324 --> 01:59.618
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

01:59.786 --> 02:01.662
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

02:01.871 --> 02:05.833
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.876
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?

02:08.627 --> 02:10.545
Games and stuff.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.092
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.553
Oh, wait, here's one. Uh...

02:17.720 --> 02:21.974
- Would you be willing to cook naked?
- There's an ad for a naked chef?

02:22.142 --> 02:27.104
No, but if you're willing to cook naked,
then you might be willing to dance naked.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.565
- And then...
- Mm.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.650
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.486
- Hey.
- Oh, so how'd you make out last night?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.868
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.452
No, wait, wait.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.997
Yeah, that's just painful.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.333
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.502
Yeah, it was.
But I get home, okay...

02:50.670 --> 02:53.755
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

02:53.965 --> 02:56.466
...and I think, "Oh, my God.
What the hell am I doing?"

02:56.634 --> 02:59.553
I mean, here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

02:59.721 --> 03:02.514
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

03:02.682 --> 03:04.850
...and am I just gonna
throw all that away?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.436
You got all that
from saline solution?

03:08.771 --> 03:12.232
Wait a minute. We're talking
about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.402
Believe me, I've been dreaming
about me and Rachel for 10 years.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.362
But now I'm with Julie.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.407
You know? So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.784
Me and Julie, me and Rach...

03:23.286 --> 03:24.578
Rachel! Rachel.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.873
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.583
Good. How are you?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.084
- Good. Um...
- Good.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.712
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.464
Julie!

03:36.925 --> 03:38.425
Um, how are you?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.052
- Good.
- Good.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.595
So everybody's here.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.389
Everybody's good.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.228
Were you gonna play something?

03:49.437 --> 03:51.313
- Oh. Well, actually...
- Play it!

03:51.481 --> 03:52.564
Oh.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.859
All right.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.903
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
- What?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.613
Shh.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.658
Okay. Um, hi.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.410
Hello. Hi. Okay.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.954
So, um... Ahem.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.207
This is a song, um,
about a love triangle...

04:10.375 --> 04:12.417
...between three people I made up.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.048
Um, it's called, um,
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

04:22.553 --> 04:26.223
There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

04:26.474 --> 04:29.726
And a guy
Let's call him Neil

04:30.478 --> 04:34.273
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

04:34.524 --> 04:37.442
This story isn't real

04:39.904 --> 04:44.658
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside?

04:44.867 --> 04:47.077
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly?

04:47.328 --> 04:50.664
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.586
He must decide
He must decide

04:56.796 --> 05:02.217
Even though I made him up
He must decide

05:03.928 --> 05:05.846
Well, this is a nice résumé.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.890
Nice, nice, nice.

05:12.353 --> 05:16.356
Uh, Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.151
Mockolate.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.194
- I'm sorry?
- Mockolate.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.613
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.657
Ooh.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.452
- Well, go ahead, try a piece.
- Oh.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.705
Yeah, we think that Mockolate
is even better than chocolate.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.124
- All right.
- Ha, ha.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.963
Mm.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.673
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.258
I love how it crumbles.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.637
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
- Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.641
Anyhoo, we should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.143
Ha-ha-ha.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.812
- Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.
- Mm.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.482
See, the way we look at it,
chocolate dominates...

05:58.733 --> 06:02.569
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.864
- Mm-hm.
- But we think given the right marketing...

06:06.032 --> 06:08.575
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Mockolate holiday.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.078
Wow.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.914
- Aren't you gonna swallow that?
- Ha, ha.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.042
- Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
- Oh.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.668
Yeah. Isn't that great?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.004
- Mm.
Ha-ha-ha.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.589
Well, anyhoo, um...

06:22.757 --> 06:26.218
...we're looking for chefs who can
create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.677
You interested?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.304
Abso...

06:29.472 --> 06:31.264
Ahem... Lutely!

06:33.142 --> 06:36.686
See, I love creating new recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...

06:36.938 --> 06:38.105
...I love Mockolate.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.398
- Really?
- Mm.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.275
Especially that aftertaste.
You know, I tell you...

06:42.485 --> 06:43.985
...that'll last you till Christmas.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.617
How about Mockolate mousse?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.285
It's not...

06:52.537 --> 06:54.121
...very Thanksgiving-y.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.124
Okay, how about
Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.251
What makes it Pilgrim?

06:59.669 --> 07:02.003
We'll put buckles on it.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.797
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.216
- Hey.
- Did Ross call?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.135
No, I'm sorry.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.470
Why didn't he call?

07:10.888 --> 07:12.514
He's gonna stay with Julie.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.850
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

07:15.101 --> 07:17.352
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.690
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

07:23.151 --> 07:26.027
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.993
I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna
do? This is like a complete nightmare!

07:33.202 --> 07:37.330
Oh, I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

07:38.666 --> 07:41.918
They're both gorgeous and sexy,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

07:42.128 --> 07:44.629
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

07:46.048 --> 07:50.010
- Hey, here's a thought, Ross...
- Don't ever touch the computer.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.847
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

07:54.098 --> 07:55.807
Threesome.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.022
Right, look. Let's get logical
about this. We'll make a list.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.815
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

08:05.234 --> 08:07.068
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.573
We'll put their names
in bold with different fonts...

08:11.782 --> 08:14.326
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.869
Can't we just use a pen?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.246
No, Amish boy.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.751
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.753
Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.297
I don't know.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.632
I mean...

08:28.799 --> 08:33.385
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.679
You could say that.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.431
Yeah.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.309
I guess, you know, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

08:41.812 --> 08:44.606
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.442
Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have
a lot in common...

08:47.610 --> 08:50.612
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.614
But Rachel's just a waitress.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.199
Waitress.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.785
Got it.
You guys wanna play "Doom"?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.790
Or we could keep doing this.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.918
What else?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.878
I don't know.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.049
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.219
Okay, let's do Julie.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.762
What's wrong with her?

09:19.433 --> 09:21.810
She's not Rachel.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.483
Okay. This is pumpkin pie
with a Mockolate crust.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.362
This is Mockolate cranberry cake,
and these are Mockolate-chip cookies.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.781
Just like the Indians served.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.244
Oh, my God!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.495
"Oh, my God" good?

09:40.663 --> 09:44.457
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.750
Oh! Ugh!

09:45.918 --> 09:49.004
Sweet Lord!
Oh, this is what evil must taste like!

09:55.052 --> 09:56.886
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.682
Yes, I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.976
You know, for a hotline,
you're not so hot.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.147
What is that in the background?

10:07.315 --> 10:08.815
Are you watching Star Trek?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.614
Hey.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.533
So how'd it go with Julie?
Did you break her heart?

10:18.743 --> 10:19.826
Yes.

10:19.994 --> 10:24.497
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.207
Mm.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.668
I did the right thing.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.504
So Spock actually hugs his father?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.508
Hey, do you guys have...?

10:37.136 --> 10:39.095
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.430
Where you going?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.516
I just got back from, uh...

10:44.101 --> 10:45.560
From Julie's.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.021
Oh.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.272
No, no.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.274
Uh, it's not what you think. Um...

10:51.442 --> 10:53.026
It's the other thing.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.161
Well, heh, ahem, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.748
Well, uh...

11:06.957 --> 11:08.166
He broke up with Julie!

11:09.710 --> 11:12.837
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

11:14.131 --> 11:15.215
Really?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.466
Really.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.344
It's always been you, Rach.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.262
Oh, God.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.770
Oh.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.774
Oh.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.567
Oh, this is good.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.945
- This is really good.
- I know. I know.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.988
It's almost...

11:45.204 --> 11:48.456
What do you say we go take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.167
- Okay. Let me get my coat.
- Okay. No, hey, whoa, whoa.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.545
I'll get your coat.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.922
Okay.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.139
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

12:04.306 --> 12:08.685
Oh, my God, you guys, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

12:08.853 --> 12:11.938
- What's that?
- What? Nothing!

12:12.940 --> 12:16.860
- What? I saw my name. What is it?
- No, no, see? See?

12:17.027 --> 12:20.947
Hey, it's printing!

12:22.158 --> 12:23.450
What is it? Let me see!

12:23.659 --> 12:25.243
Hey, someone order a coat?

12:25.453 --> 12:28.747
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me
and he won't let me see.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.082
He won't? He won't!

12:32.877 --> 12:34.461
Because isn't that...

12:34.628 --> 12:36.838
...the short story you were writing?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.091
Yes, it is a short story...

12:40.259 --> 12:41.676
...that I was writing.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.762
And I'm in it? Well, let me read it.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.638
No!

12:47.183 --> 12:51.019
- Come on!
- Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.697
All right.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.500
"It was summer.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.420
And it was hot.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.215
- Rachel was there.
- Eh?

13:23.594 --> 13:26.221
A lonely gray couch.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.766
'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.561
And then the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

13:37.149 --> 13:40.527
That's it? That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

13:42.238 --> 13:43.446
This isn't funny anymore.

13:43.614 --> 13:47.659
There's something about me
on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.661
No, you don't.

13:51.413 --> 13:55.416
All right, you know what? Fine.
If you guys wanna be children, that's fine.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.835
- I do not need to see it!
- Ha!

13:57.002 --> 13:58.127
No, no, no!

13:58.295 --> 13:59.921
Go, go, go!

14:02.383 --> 14:03.716
Ooh.

14:03.884 --> 14:04.968
What is this?

14:05.135 --> 14:06.219
That is...

14:06.387 --> 14:07.720
- No, no, no.
- Ah...

14:07.888 --> 14:08.972
Ross, what is this?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.432
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.647
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.982
"Kind of ditzy"?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.317
Ahem. "Too into her looks"?

14:22.570 --> 14:23.778
"Spoiled"?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.489
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

14:28.993 --> 14:30.952
"Just a waitress"?

14:32.079 --> 14:34.122
Now, that was, uh...

14:34.331 --> 14:36.958
I mean, as opposed to, uh...

14:37.126 --> 14:40.295
The, um... Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

14:40.504 --> 14:44.340
Ah! I do not have chubby ankles!

14:44.592 --> 14:45.842
No! I... No. Rach, Rach...

14:46.051 --> 14:49.262
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.514
"She's not Rachem"?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.975
- No...
- What the hell's a Rachem?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.769
- No, no...
- Is that some stupid paleontology word...

14:56.937 --> 14:59.355
...that I wouldn't know
because I'm just a waitress?

14:59.523 --> 15:01.608
No. Rach, come on! Rach...

15:01.775 --> 15:03.443
Rach! Rach! No, no!

15:03.611 --> 15:05.778
It's "She's not Rachel"!
She's not...

15:09.700 --> 15:11.451
Rachel?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.665
My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!

15:17.833 --> 15:20.877
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

15:21.045 --> 15:26.257
No, that's true. You'd be a great person
to have around the day after an emergency.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.636
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.722
- I know.
- What a dinkus!

15:33.432 --> 15:36.601
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.186
- What?
- What?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.980
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.441
- This was your idea?
- What?

15:43.609 --> 15:48.196
Let's get some perspective here, okay?
These things happen for a reason.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.572
Yeah. You!

15:51.492 --> 15:55.745
All right, Pheebs, back me up here.
You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

15:55.955 --> 15:59.832
Yeah. Listen, by the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.769
Rach! Whoa...

16:20.270 --> 16:21.354
Rach!

16:21.522 --> 16:24.023
Hey! Uh, open up! Please?

16:24.233 --> 16:28.152
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

16:28.362 --> 16:30.697
That doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

16:30.906 --> 16:33.449
I just want to read you something,
your "Pro List."

16:33.826 --> 16:35.243
Not interested.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.869
Okay, okay.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.373
"Number one:
The way you cry at game shows. Aw.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.335
Number two:
How much you love your friends.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.589
Number three: The way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.677
Number four: How brave you are
for starting your life over.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.055
Number five:
How great you are with Ben.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.600
Number six: The way you smell."

17:01.186 --> 17:02.311
What are you doing?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.396
Joey, you wanna open the window?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.523
Oh, yeah.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.569
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm, um...

17:09.737 --> 17:12.280
My gosh, you must be freezing.
You know what you need?

17:12.489 --> 17:16.075
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Mockolate?

17:19.747 --> 17:20.954
Rach, come on, open up.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.292
Rach, come on. Come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.211
No.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.547
- No?
- That's what I said.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.923
Maybe we should go.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.217
No, you don't have to go.
We're done talking.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.011
Rach, come on.
I know how you must...

17:35.220 --> 17:36.929
No, you don't, Ross.

17:37.514 --> 17:41.434
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.897
Now, how would you feel if the one person
that you trusted the most in the world...

17:46.065 --> 17:47.774
...not only thinks them too...

17:47.941 --> 17:51.986
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

17:52.196 --> 17:56.616
No, but see, I wanna be with you
in spite of all those things.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.161
Oh. Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.038
I said, don't go!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.209
You know what?

18:06.376 --> 18:11.339
If things were the other way around,
there is nothing you could put on a list...

18:11.507 --> 18:14.300
...that would ever make me
not wanna be with you.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.221
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.057
See, I'd never make a list.

18:36.490 --> 18:41.077
I never know how long you're supposed to
wait in this situation before you can talk.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.664
Maybe a little longer.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.339
In some of these recipes,
the quantities may seem a little unusual.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.425
Uh, like these coconut Mockolate
holiday nut bars?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.804
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of crushed nuts...

19:00.013 --> 19:03.224
...and only one tablespoon
of Mockolate.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.434
Doesn't matter.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.769
What?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.397
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.525
Something about laboratory rats.
Huh.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.902
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.404
Yeah.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.406
Well, anyhoo, here's your check.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.200
Thank you for all
you went through.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.622
Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.374
Well, I ate some.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.835
Oh, some. That's fine. Some's not a lot.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.420
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.590
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.896
Hello.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.189
Hi.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.817
Is that him again?

19:55.027 --> 19:58.779
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.618
Listen, I don't think this is the best time.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.787
Look, can you do something for me?

20:06.997 --> 20:08.915
Sure. What?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.417
Okay.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.920
All right.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.466
Music?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.885
- Sure.
- Okay.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.852
The next one's
dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.855
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

20:33.023 --> 20:36.275
...and he hopes you can
find it in your heart to forgive him.

20:36.443 --> 20:40.863
See the stone set in your eyes

20:41.031 --> 20:44.951
See the thorn twist in your side

20:45.452 --> 20:49.247
I'll wait for you

20:54.253 --> 20:57.546
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

20:58.215 --> 21:03.135
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

21:03.303 --> 21:07.556
And I'll wait without you

21:07.724 --> 21:09.809
Uh,
we've just gotten a call from Rachel...

21:09.977 --> 21:12.687
...and she told us what Ross did.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.815
It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

21:15.983 --> 21:19.151
...I don't wanna play
your song anymore.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.368
Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

21:27.577 --> 21:30.037
Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

21:30.205 --> 21:32.331
...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

21:32.499 --> 21:36.043
There's a room where

21:36.211 --> 21:39.588
I can go and

21:39.756 --> 21:45.177
Tell my secrets to

21:45.512 --> 21:55.563
In my room

21:55.731 --> 22:02.570
In my room, in my room

22:02.738 --> 22:05.614
In my room

22:06.491 --> 22:07.575
Hi.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.076
Thanks for coming in again.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.746
Oh, not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.081
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Ha-ha-ha.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.419
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.131
Now, they taste exactly
like pistachios...

22:22.341 --> 22:24.467
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.428
Here, try one.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.681
- All right.
- You're not allergic to anything?

22:30.891 --> 22:33.976
- Uh, cat hair.
- Oh, sorry.
