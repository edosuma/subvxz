Stop!

01:21.122 --> 01:22.290

01:24.959 --> 01:26.753
That is not Carmen Sandiego.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.172
<i>She calls herself "the Duchess."</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:33.343

Thirty million euro for that?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.145
"Woman in Blue Reading a Letter"

01:44.229 --> 01:47.690
is one of Johannes Vermeer's
most important earlier works.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.943
See the hallmark of his style?

01:50.276 --> 01:54.572
The way he paints natural light
makes his subject look so realistic.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.450

<i>You're not with Interpol anymore.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:27.355

<i>this Duchess is working for VILE.</i>

02:32.152 --> 02:36.197
Or whether she is an accomplice

02:39.826 --> 02:43.246
[Carmen] Blue isn't really my color,

<i>Player's decryption</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:14.402
<i>revealed details</i>
<i>of an intricate ongoing operation.</i>

03:14.485 --> 03:18.615
<i>VILE operatives have been quietly</i>
<i>stealing paintings by the artist Vermeer</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:20.783
<i>from museums all over the world</i>

03:20.867 --> 03:24.954
<i>and replacing the originals</i>
<i>with amazingly accurate forgeries.</i>

03:25.496 --> 03:26.331
<i>What?</i>

03:26.664 --> 03:28.958
Why would they bother
leaving fakes behind?

03:29.167 --> 03:31.377
To ensure museum security
would never realize

03:31.461 --> 03:33.588
the originals had been stolen
to begin with,

03:33.796 --> 03:36.591
<i>which would allow the entirety</i>
<i>of Vermeer's collected works</i>

03:36.674 --> 03:42.347
<i>to slowly and steadily be amassed</i>
<i>by VILE mastermind Countess Cleo.</i>

03:43.139 --> 03:45.391
What's the big whoop
about these paintings anyway?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.186
No cars, no clowns,
no dogs playing poker.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.189
Yeah, and she's reading.
Snore.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.774
<i>You aren't the only ones who thought that.</i>

03:52.857 --> 03:56.194
<i>But after some research, I began</i>
<i>to see things in a different light.</i>

03:57.779 --> 04:00.448
<i>The Netherlands isn't only known</i>
<i>for its tulips, windmills,</i>

04:00.531 --> 04:01.699
<i>and wooden shoes.</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:05.453
<i>It's famous for its painters</i>
<i>from the Dutch Golden Age of the 1600s,</i>

04:05.536 --> 04:06.579
<i>Vermeer among them.</i>

04:07.121 --> 04:10.166
[Carmen] <i>But the ordinary people</i>
<i>of his portraits weren't the stars.</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:11.709
<i>That would be the mind-boggling way</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:14.504
<i>Vermeer captured natural light</i>
<i>with his paintbrush.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:17.548
<i>Only 34 confirmed paintings</i>
<i>by the maestro exist.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:19.550
<i>Not a whole lot for a major artist.</i>

04:19.634 --> 04:23.263
<i>That makes each one</i>
<i>an extremely rare and valuable treasure.</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:24.597
[Player] <i>Which is why we freaked</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:27.934
<i>when we learned there was only</i>
<i>one last Vermeer left for Cleo to steal,</i>

04:28.017 --> 04:30.979
<i>from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam,</i>
<i>capital of the Netherlands.</i>

04:31.062 --> 04:33.398
[Carmen] <i>So I had to act fast</i>
<i>and got to it first</i>

04:33.481 --> 04:37.902
<i>and made my escape</i>
<i>through one of Amsterdam's 165 canals,</i>

04:38.528 --> 04:41.072
<i>masquerading as the Duchess.</i>

04:43.700 --> 04:47.662
"Woman in Blue Reading a Letter" is our
only shot at stealing back the other 33.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.374
We need Cleo to take the bait
so we can push for a direct face-to-face

04:51.457 --> 04:53.835
in the hopes of figuring out
where she's keeping the rest.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.503
<i>And if she had any suspicion</i>

04:55.586 --> 04:58.673
<i>that she were dealing with</i>
<i>the master super thief Carmen Sandiego,</i>

04:58.756 --> 05:01.384
<i>she'd never let you anywhere near</i>
<i>her stolen prizes.</i>

05:01.718 --> 05:04.929
That's why when Cleo's courier arrives
to authenticate the painting,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.056
it'll be the Duchess
who meets him at the door.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.266
[knocking at door]

05:08.349 --> 05:10.852
<i>Whoa, that can't be him.</i>
<i>He's an hour early.</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:14.063
Yowza!
Room service is wicked fast here.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.815

05:23.573 --> 05:27.994
Oh, still running on Moscow time.
Hmm.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.831
Um, you're not a duchess.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.208
You're not my sandwich.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.211
[chuckles] I must have the wrong room.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.965
Oh, there she is.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.386
"The Woman in Blah..."

05:46.304 --> 05:50.058

06:13.164 --> 06:16.084

06:20.630 --> 06:23.633
Does, uh, this mean anything to ya?

06:24.634 --> 06:27.386
[laughs nervously]
I'll inform the countess.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.931
<i>Mr. Haber, report.</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:31.349
The painting checks out.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.269

to deal directly with you.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.562
<i>Duke?</i>

06:36.646 --> 06:39.148
<i>I promised a complete collection.</i>

<i>in my hands tomorrow night,</i>

<i>I'll be the laughingstock</i>
<i>of the criminal underworld.</i>

06:45.571 --> 06:49.158
The countess wishes to invite you
to a dinner party and auction.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.952
Great!
Yeah, text me the address.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.330
[Dash] Good. A car will pick you up
tomorrow, 5:00 p.m. sharp.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.959
And no plus ones, just the painting.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.047

07:04.549 --> 07:06.551
Yes, the kind with the holes.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.344
[Player] <i>Why would Cleo</i>
<i>auction the Vermeers</i>

07:08.427 --> 07:10.596
<i>after going through so much trouble</i>
<i>to complete the set?</i>

07:10.763 --> 07:13.433
The thrill of the hunt
doesn't last long for her,

07:13.516 --> 07:17.145
and the combined value of the art
could easily surpass one billion dollars.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.187

07:18.271 --> 07:20.231
Hello, VILE slush fund.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.026
We'll only have a brief window to steal
back all 34 while they're under one roof

07:24.110 --> 07:25.987
before they scatter to the winds.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.739
The good news is we're invited to a party.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.658
<i>And the not-so-good?</i>

07:30.741 --> 07:34.662
We only have 24 hours to transform Zack
into a convincing duke.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.126
Cleo will expect a duke
to speak in proper diction.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.089
Repeat after me.
"Park the car in Aardvark Yard."

07:45.173 --> 07:47.300
"Pahk" the "cahr" in Aahrdvark "Yahd."

07:49.635 --> 07:53.055
Park the car in Aardvark Yard.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.058
Pahk the cahr-- Hold on, hold on.
I'm gonna get it.

07:56.684 --> 08:00.938
Cleo will expect a gentleman
to wear appropriate wardrobe.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.441
Oh, no, not a monkey suit.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.318
It suits you.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.403

Oh, come on!
You never said I'd have to eat fish.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.173
If they serve it, just keep telling
yourself it tastes like chicken.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.801
You need to learn enough talking points
about art history to fit in.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.678
Oh, come on. Why?

08:32.762 --> 08:36.974
Because if Cleo thinks for even one moment
you are not who you say you are,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.851
she'll feed you to her dogs.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.103
Just don't let her feed me any fish.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.188

08:42.271 --> 08:46.609
Okay, okay, okay.

12:34.795 --> 12:35.963
Look below the screen

12:36.130 --> 12:38.591
<i>and swipe in the direction</i>
<i>you wish to eject.</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:41.093
Mm, ah!

12:41.719 --> 12:42.636
[beeping]

12:43.554 --> 12:46.515
So, do we fish him out or follow my bro?

12:48.517 --> 12:50.686
[Devineaux screaming]

12:52.480 --> 12:54.857
-[door closes]
-We're back on the Zack track.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.743
I present to you Countess Cleo...

13:06.410 --> 13:10.623
the Queen of Mean,
the Empress of Distress, the Hostess--

13:10.706 --> 13:11.624
Zip it.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.587
[in British accent] <i>Buona sera,</i>
<i>mia bella contessa. </i>[kisses]

13:16.921 --> 13:17.922
The work of art.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.092
[in wavering accent] 'Course!
Quite luminous, wouldn't you say?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.137
<i>Wunderbar</i>.
Wire the funds.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.682
-[computer chirping]
-[Player] Funds received, Red.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.228
VILE just fed a whole lot of orphans
in your favorite charity.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.104
And I just fed security.

13:34.813 --> 13:35.648
[growls]

13:36.398 --> 13:38.984
[dog whining]

13:39.068 --> 13:41.362
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

13:41.445 --> 13:42.988
You are!
Yeah, you are!

13:45.407 --> 13:47.159
Shall we dine, Countess?

13:47.618 --> 13:50.162
Aren't you forgetting something,
Monsieur Haber?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.749
My assistant...

13:54.166 --> 13:56.919
he thinks Vermeer's
a neighborhood in Boston.

13:57.002 --> 13:57.878
[chuckles]

13:57.962 --> 14:00.339
[laughs] Imagine!

14:00.422 --> 14:04.093
His idea of art is probably
a painting of dogs playing poker!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.595
[both laughing]

14:10.015 --> 14:12.560
[mocking humming]

14:13.143 --> 14:14.770
Ugh! Duke schmuke.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.778
-[beeping]
-[Player] I'm seeing a disarm code.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.364
-[glass clinking]
-And I'm hearing a speech coming on.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.158
-[chatter, laughter]
-[glass clinking]

14:28.492 --> 14:30.494
Vilest art enthusiasts,

14:30.786 --> 14:35.082
my deepest gratitude for attending
this once-in-a-lifetime event.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.377
The art auction
will directly follow dinner.

14:39.461 --> 14:44.550
Allow me to at least fill your bellies
before emptying your bank accounts.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.135
[guests laugh] Here, here!

14:49.763 --> 14:50.598
[beeps]

15:06.864 --> 15:08.657
[beeping]

15:16.665 --> 15:19.376
Now, this one really speaks to me.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.754
<i>So, where are we at, Player?</i>

15:22.087 --> 15:23.714
First course is on the table.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.634
<i>You need to be in and out</i>
<i>with 34 paintings</i>

15:26.717 --> 15:28.636
<i>by the time bananas Foster is served.</i>

15:29.386 --> 15:30.429
Pressure triggers.

15:30.679 --> 15:34.058
We get one half-second for the swap,
or the place goes into lockdown.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.601
Right, Carm.

15:43.025 --> 15:43.943
[both exhale]

15:44.443 --> 15:46.528
One down, 33 to go.

15:47.529 --> 15:51.283
When the countess asked me to replicate
each of Vermeer's masterworks,

15:51.367 --> 15:54.286
I welcomed the challenge
to capture their essence.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.248
Well, it seems the challenge
for Monsieur Duke here

15:58.332 --> 16:01.585
is remembering to drink
from his own water glass.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.758
[in wavering accent] Sticky fingers.
Uh, once a thief, always a thief, right?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.679
Well, aren't you naughty?

16:11.762 --> 16:14.390
We shall all have to watch
our billfolds around this one.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.976
[guests laughing]

16:30.114 --> 16:32.866
Good news, Red.
Main course was poached pheasant.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.161
Couldn't taste any more like chicken.
Zack's in the clear.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.162
<i>And the bad news?</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:40.332
[Player] Dessert's about to be served.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
We could really use more time.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.928
[in wavering accent] Oh, yeah!
Uh, what's for dessert?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.388
Baked Alaska.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.515
But first, a palate cleanser,

16:56.598 --> 16:59.476
dredged from the Russian sea
just this morning.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.312
Fresh beluga caviar.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.149
-[guests chuckling]
-[woman] Oh!

17:05.232 --> 17:06.608
-Ahh!
-Mmm!

17:07.443 --> 17:08.777
This, uh... [smacks lips]

17:08.861 --> 17:11.613
This wouldn't be... fish?

17:11.739 --> 17:12.573
Uh-oh.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.159
Of course not, you cheeky monkey.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.245
It's fish eggs.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.455
[gulps]

17:19.830 --> 17:22.291
What's wrong, Duke?
Not a fan?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.419
[squishing]

17:25.878 --> 17:27.212
[gagging]

17:28.088 --> 17:32.259
I... in fact, love delicious,
tiny, black non-chicken eggs

17:32.342 --> 17:34.595
that don't taste anything like chicken.

17:39.141 --> 17:39.975
[gulps]

17:46.815 --> 17:49.359
[laughs] Funny, I never realized.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.820
"Duke" rhymes with "puke."

17:52.279 --> 17:53.113
[gags]

17:56.033 --> 17:56.867
[swallows]

18:03.332 --> 18:04.166
[door opens]

18:04.249 --> 18:05.626
[Devineaux] Do not be alarmed!

18:05.876 --> 18:08.420
I am Inspector Devineaux,
and I'm here to warn you

18:08.504 --> 18:10.964
there may be a criminal in your midst!

18:12.466 --> 18:13.801
Is that so?

18:15.761 --> 18:18.931
[Player] <i>Red, I think we just bought you</i>
<i>some extra time.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:24.978
A twisted mastermind
has been stealing priceless works of art

18:25.062 --> 18:26.647
from museums across Europe.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.524
She is a true menace.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.025
She?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.903
Yes, indeed. "She."

18:34.071 --> 18:35.864
Carmen Sandiego.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.911
Carmen Sandiego, here?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.246
Impossible.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.377
[gas hissing]

18:56.635 --> 18:59.763
Not only might Carmen Sandiego
be lurking somewhere on these premises,

18:59.847 --> 19:02.599
but I have reason to believe
she is working with an accomplice...

19:02.850 --> 19:05.435
who could be any one of you.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.521
There she goes!

19:09.606 --> 19:10.524
<i>La Femme Rouge!</i>

19:12.025 --> 19:13.277
Return to your meals.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.574
Dessert's off.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.123
Ha-ha!
Two can dance that tango.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.457
[engine starts]

19:27.749 --> 19:30.544
[dogs barking]

19:40.429 --> 19:41.889
[barking]

19:55.402 --> 19:57.487
You've cooked.
Now it's time to clean.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.448
Scrub the chateau.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.665
[Devineaux] Whoa!

20:18.550 --> 20:21.428
Not tonight, you scarlet ski demon.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.909
Stop right there, Carmen Sandiego.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.577
Who?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.455
You could have maimed me,
you maniac!

20:48.747 --> 20:50.999
[stammering] But your red coat!

20:51.500 --> 20:52.376
What about it?

20:52.459 --> 20:55.212
Red brings out my eyes
and coats are warm!

21:01.885 --> 21:04.012
[Zack] So, Ivy's playing red herring?

21:04.471 --> 21:06.390
Huh. That's one fish I don't mind.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.268
You're not the only one
who can nail a role, Duke.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.862
[camera shutter clicking]

21:22.281 --> 21:25.993
[Chief] <i>Seems someone didn't wanna leave</i>
<i>any trace of this dinner party.</i>

21:26.493 --> 21:29.913
So, you are saying I may have been
standing in the very same room

21:29.997 --> 21:32.124
amongst operatives of VILE?

21:32.207 --> 21:36.211
<i>The very organization</i>
<i>I've dedicated my life to proving exists?</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:40.382
<i>Yes, Agent Devineaux,</i>
<i>that would be an accurate summary.</i>

21:40.757 --> 21:43.885
But we may have both been right
about Carmen Sandiego.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.557
[reporter] <i>Needless to say, the mysterious</i>
<i>return of 34 stolen Vermeers</i>

21:48.640 --> 21:52.561
<i>to institutions around the world</i>
<i>has shocked the art community.</i>

21:53.270 --> 21:57.441
Stealing historic works of art
doesn't seem to be her MO,

21:57.524 --> 22:01.611
though she may have been working
with the Duchess all along.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.071
[groans]

22:03.155 --> 22:05.115
[Chief] <i>A harsh reminder</i>
<i>that we live in a world</i>

22:05.198 --> 22:07.743
<i>where villains may not always look</i>
<i>like villains.</i>

22:08.702 --> 22:10.746
<i>Nor heroes like heroes.</i>

22:12.039 --> 22:14.124
<i>All that we can be assured of</i>

22:14.207 --> 22:17.836
<i>is that VILE will continue to operate</i>
<i>from the shadows.</i>

22:18.545 --> 22:24.593
<i>So it is imperative that ACME</i>
<i>view the world in shades of gray.</i>

22:27.471 --> 22:30.724
[theme music playing]
