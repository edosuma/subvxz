<i>Today is best day ever.</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:51.555
<i>Moving Day!</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:53.261
For who?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.806
<i>Answer: The Boov.</i>

00:55.973 --> 00:57.145
<i>Who are the Boov?</i>

00:57.307 --> 01:01.483
<i>Answer: Best species ever at running away.</i>

01:01.645 --> 01:04.944
<i>All Boov settlers, please report
to your assigned transport.</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:06.404
<i>You are allowed one carry-on.</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:08.410
Excusing me. Sorries.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.822
Excusing me.
Pardon the me, friend.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.490
Boov do not friend.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.619
Owpain!

01:13.782 --> 01:14.783
Uh-oh. Sorries.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.624
<i>Who am I?
I am Oh.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.960
<i>I has been given this name
by my many, many friends.</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:23.459
- Good morning!
- Oh.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.751
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.918
- Hello.
- Oh.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.849
<i>I am very excitement
to make a new fresh start!</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:38.312
<i>We are all moving to best planet ever
for to hiding.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:40.608
<i>Our new home!</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:54.205
Captain Smek!

01:56.199 --> 01:58.873
My fellow Boov!

01:59.036 --> 02:00.788
I has saved us again.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.372
A bit lower.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.545
No, stop!

02:04.708 --> 02:05.709
Up a bit. Up a bit.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.128
Perfect. Walk away. Walk away.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.547
My fellow...

02:10.547 --> 02:11.548
My...

02:12.382 --> 02:13.383
fellow...

02:15.177 --> 02:16.178
Boov.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.806
Good news!

02:20.557 --> 02:22.559
Thanks to my leadership skills...

02:22.726 --> 02:25.570
cowering, running
and pulling a skedaddle...

02:25.729 --> 02:27.402
we are safe from our enemy...

02:27.564 --> 02:28.907
the Gorg.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.820
Nasty.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.168
Give Daddy some sugar!

02:40.577 --> 02:42.830
Captain Smek has saved us again!

02:42.996 --> 02:47.752
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.421
And the Gorg are lactose intolerant.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.260
Genius!

02:52.422 --> 02:54.766
They will never find us here.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.264
Thank you!

02:57.594 --> 02:58.766
Best of yet...

02:58.929 --> 03:01.273
this planet is full of great stuff.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.106
Look at these delicious fruits!

03:08.563 --> 03:10.531
That makes me feel so good.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.368
What fun at a party!

03:13.527 --> 03:14.949
Boov do not party.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.372
Also, this planet is inhabited.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.703
But do not worry.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.290
The native savages are
simple and backwards.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.087
They are so ugly, they are cute!

03:29.626 --> 03:32.049
Everything you need to know about them
can be found...

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
in these comprehensive pamphlets.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.804
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Comprehensive pamphlet.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.311
They are lucky the Boov have come.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.143
All right, Boov. Invade on three.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.397
One, two, three.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.652
<i>Rejoice, humanspeople!
The Boov are arrived!</i>

03:54.818 --> 03:57.446
<i>Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily...</i>

03:57.612 --> 04:01.082
<i>so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier.</i>

04:01.241 --> 04:02.743
<i>And more fun!</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:04.627
<i>So, what is up?</i>

04:04.995 --> 04:06.212
<i>You are!</i>

04:20.844 --> 04:22.562
You'll never catch me!

04:24.931 --> 04:27.901
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>

04:28.059 --> 04:31.063
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>

04:47.913 --> 04:50.257
This is so cool! Come on!

04:53.835 --> 04:54.927
<i>Fa-da!</i>

04:55.086 --> 05:00.013
<i>Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown.</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:01.972
Welcome to your new home.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.058
- Wait, what? No!
- New home?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.815
<i>And rest of planet is for Boov.</i>

05:06.973 --> 05:08.145
<i>Win-win!</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:14.565
<i>Welcome, Boov settlers.</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:16.825
<i>All humans have been relocated.</i>

05:16.983 --> 05:18.610
<i>Your homes are now ready.</i>

05:18.777 --> 05:20.120
Thanking you!

05:23.657 --> 05:26.706
<i>This planet may be
a bit of a fixing-it-upper...</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:28.120
<i>but that is okay.</i>

05:28.537 --> 05:31.837
<i>Boov are best at deciding what is useful.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:33.250
<i>And what is not.</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:35.668
Owpain.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.004
Step aside. Clean-up crew.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.297
<i>Useless.</i>

05:47.848 --> 05:50.601
<i>Today, I starts a new life.</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:53.987
<i>With new friends. In a new home.</i>

05:55.355 --> 05:58.450
<i>Residents may now enter sector 179.</i>

05:58.608 --> 05:59.609
That is me!

05:59.776 --> 06:04.156
<i>And that is why today is best day ever!</i>

06:24.175 --> 06:26.348
Welcome home, neighbors!

06:26.511 --> 06:28.479
Boov do not have "neighbors."

06:28.847 --> 06:32.727
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.155
Hey! Can I borrowing a cup of sugar?

06:39.441 --> 06:40.533
What?

06:41.109 --> 06:44.955
But now, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.952
You are all invited...

06:47.115 --> 06:49.243
to my warming of house party.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.504
Say, 5:00?

06:52.913 --> 06:53.914
Sure.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.664
Yes!

08:00.063 --> 08:03.033
<i>Hey, Pig! Be careful up there!</i>

08:04.150 --> 08:05.150
I'm sorry, Pig.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.782
Mom's not here.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.071
It's just a video.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.957
<i>Hey, Mom.
I think Pig wants to join us.</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:13.077
<i>It's not funny!</i>

08:13.785 --> 08:14.785
<i>Tip!</i>

08:14.911 --> 08:16.788
<i>Come on, Mom.
It's just snow.</i>

08:16.955 --> 08:18.423
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

08:18.581 --> 08:21.084
<i>We're from Barbados!
We don't have snow!</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:24.962
<i>Are you okay?</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:27.757
<i>I'm sending this to everyone.</i>

08:43.106 --> 08:46.360
<i>Sector 195 is ready for occupation.</i>

08:48.028 --> 08:50.281
We can't wait for Mom, Pig.
We gotta go.

08:50.947 --> 08:51.947
Right now!

09:21.811 --> 09:22.811
Oh, no!

09:30.779 --> 09:32.247
<i>Prepare for your dance attack!</i>

09:52.884 --> 09:55.012
Okay, let's go find Mom.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.050
Neighbors, hello!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.967
Please come in and...

10:38.179 --> 10:39.852
Hello.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.393
Hello?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.975
And right. And left. Other left.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.233
Kyle!

11:25.977 --> 11:26.977
Right. No, left.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.821
Hello, friend Kyle.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.278
I am not your friend.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.490
Of course you are.
We have had many enjoyable talks.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.827
No, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.333
You are always saying the funny things.

11:40.491 --> 11:44.291
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.709
I will not. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.628
Since you are at your busyness,
I shall send an e-vite to you...

11:51.794 --> 11:54.013
so you can join later
during your leisure minute.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.300
Please do not send.
I enjoy my leisure minute.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.470
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.189
<i>Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:07.728
You sent directions to everyone?

12:08.144 --> 12:10.192
What?
It is not my fault.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.283
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"?

12:14.734 --> 12:15.951
This is just bad design.

12:16.110 --> 12:20.160
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy!

12:20.657 --> 12:21.657
Uh-oh.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.417
"Uh-oh" is right!

12:23.576 --> 12:26.045
Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it...

12:26.204 --> 12:28.798
and can use directions for to find us!

12:28.957 --> 12:30.254
The Gorg?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.221
<i>Fa-da!</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:43.809
You have doomed our species!

12:44.973 --> 12:45.769
No, please.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.105
I did not mean to.
I am sorries!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.815
You are arresting!

12:49.978 --> 12:51.150
No!

12:51.312 --> 12:52.985
I was just trying to invite you to my...

12:56.776 --> 12:57.993
Security has been compromised.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.870
Arrest that Boov!

13:01.698 --> 13:03.371
Autopilot, I needs help!

13:03.533 --> 13:06.878
<i>Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters.</i>

13:07.036 --> 13:09.380
No, Autopilot!
Any place but Paris!

13:09.539 --> 13:11.883
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.883
<i>The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica.</i>

13:17.672 --> 13:18.969
Group hug!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.887
Yes! Antarctica is perfect!
Take me there now!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.849
<i>I am sorry. You are fugitive Boov.</i>

13:28.016 --> 13:29.518
<i>Initiating Self-Destruct.</i>

13:29.684 --> 13:31.357
No! Do not initiate!

13:31.519 --> 13:32.816
I am not a fugitive!

13:48.244 --> 13:49.244
No!

14:11.601 --> 14:12.693
Oh, no.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.518
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.276
Whatfor are you did this?

15:35.435 --> 15:38.530
I am Boov, beloved by all humans.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.190
I know what you are.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.859
Excellent! Can I come into the out now?

15:43.025 --> 15:45.448
No, you cannot "come into the out" now.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.989
You can never come into the out,
ever again!

15:48.698 --> 15:50.166
But I can!

15:50.324 --> 15:53.203
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.877
Then I will have to...

15:57.039 --> 16:01.215
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs!

16:02.295 --> 16:03.638
You can do that?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.511
Yes.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.724
If you shoot your eye lasers,
then I'll have no choice...

16:13.890 --> 16:15.392
but to explode your head!

16:15.558 --> 16:18.311
- You humans cannot to explode...
- We can too!

16:18.478 --> 16:19.821
We just don't much.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.196
It's considered rude.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.322
Then I am granting you a truce.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.487
You are not to exploding heads...

16:27.653 --> 16:30.577
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.707
Okay. Truce.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.588
- So, can I come into the out now?
- No!

16:37.997 --> 16:41.672
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.427
You are thinking a mistake.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.884
Boov do not steal and abduct.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.891
No, Boov liberate and befriend.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.433
Guess who made this one!

16:53.596 --> 16:55.348
This is so beautiful!

16:57.183 --> 16:59.185
Mom! What's happening?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.444
I don't know, honey.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.105
Tip!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.450
It will be okay.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.741
<i>Lifeform detected. Not human.
Move along.</i>

17:12.906 --> 17:15.626
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>

17:15.785 --> 17:18.128
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:19.963
Mom!

17:23.251 --> 17:25.424
It's all your fault.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.759
You stole my mom!

17:28.464 --> 17:30.637
Smell ya later, Boov.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.427
Wait! Smell me now!

17:32.760 --> 17:35.980
I can to fixing your car.
I seen you has broken it.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.812
I didn't break it.
I'm a very good driver.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.444
It's supposed to leak like that.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.794
Can I come into the out now?

17:59.412 --> 18:03.838
<i>I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible...</i>

18:04.000 --> 18:07.174
<i>yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.</i>

18:07.336 --> 18:10.590
<i>But let me reassure you,
the signal he broadcast...</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:11.973
<i>is being handled.</i>

18:12.133 --> 18:15.512
We are definitely not doomed.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.811
- And we're out.
- We are doomed!

18:18.889 --> 18:21.142
The Gorg are going to find us again!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.528
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.780
This is bad.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.156
And I really love this planet.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.572
Look at all the great stuff they've got.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.991
Like this! A headband!

18:37.158 --> 18:40.207
And for evening wear, you slide it down...

18:40.369 --> 18:42.087
you got a beautiful spare tire.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.246
I love it!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.544
Very nice!

18:44.707 --> 18:47.335
Who would wanna leave this behind?
I have got to fix this.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.836
I know!

18:49.003 --> 18:51.005
Summon the Big Brain Boovs.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.345
The smarty-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.426
Gentleboov...

18:55.593 --> 18:57.391
I want ideas.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.433
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.352
then go live there.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.737
Yes! I love it!

19:06.896 --> 19:08.148
How long would that take?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.316
Based on our current technology...

19:12.234 --> 19:13.861
1.7 million years.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.781
That's a lot of years, Toni.
Moving on!

19:16.947 --> 19:18.995
- We could lay on the ground...
- Yes!

19:19.158 --> 19:22.332
And make the Gorg think we are dead.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.590
Next!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.677
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email...

19:29.835 --> 19:31.132
and cancelled his e-vite...

19:31.295 --> 19:34.765
Shush! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email...

19:34.924 --> 19:37.643
and cancel his invitation, and...

19:38.094 --> 19:38.890
What was that?

19:39.053 --> 19:40.600
So the Gorg never receive it.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.099
So the Gorg never receive it!

19:43.265 --> 19:47.236
Now, type in the password
and cancel that message.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.865
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password."

19:51.023 --> 19:52.115
It's so easy to remember.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.372
It did not work! His password is unique.

19:57.988 --> 19:58.784
No!

19:58.948 --> 20:02.327
Unique?
Boov are not unique!

20:03.744 --> 20:04.996
Fetch me my inhaler.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.879
Boy, that works.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.298
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.636
Show me his invite.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.261
<i>You are all invited to a party!</i>

20:20.428 --> 20:21.600
<i>Just head to the Milky Way.</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:23.014
<i>Turn right at the Big Dipper.</i>

20:23.180 --> 20:24.477
<i>Third planet from the Sun.</i>

20:24.640 --> 20:26.984
<i>Look for my balloons!
Party!</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:29.775
<i>Come if you like to have fun!</i>

20:29.937 --> 20:31.780
<i>My best friend Kyle will be there!</i>

20:31.939 --> 20:33.657
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:35.066
<i>Come party!</i>

20:36.318 --> 20:37.365
Kyle!

20:37.778 --> 20:39.576
He is not my friend.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.867
The internet does not lie!

20:42.032 --> 20:43.750
You know him, you can find him.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.411
I am putting you in charge!

20:45.578 --> 20:48.218
But, Captain, it is not my job.
I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.549
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.
- Thank you.

20:50.708 --> 20:55.009
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.759
We need his password...

20:56.922 --> 21:00.142
or we will all be destroyed by the Gorg!

21:00.301 --> 21:01.301
Find him!

21:01.343 --> 21:05.473
That Boov has made his final mistake.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.807
Fa-da!

21:06.974 --> 21:08.726
You were supposed to fix it!

21:08.893 --> 21:10.019
What is this?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.280
I calls it "Slushious."

21:32.917 --> 21:33.917
"Slushious"?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.302
It makes excellent fuel...

21:35.461 --> 21:37.088
and comes in fun-to-say flavors.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.505
"Grape Escape."

21:38.589 --> 21:39.761
"Tangerine Twist."

21:39.924 --> 21:41.176
"Busta Lime"!

21:42.259 --> 21:43.511
Mom's gonna kill me.

21:43.677 --> 21:48.649
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.153
Actually, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose. Hold still.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.530
No! Your gratitude is implied.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.283
You can drives first.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.819
Then I can...

21:59.985 --> 22:01.157
You're not coming.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.823
I'm trying to hide from the Boov.
I'm not bringing one with me.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.206
You'll just turn me in.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.414
No! I just needs a ride!

22:07.576 --> 22:10.750
I haves official Boov business
out of in town.

22:10.913 --> 22:11.913
Me, too.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.091
But I fixes your car!

22:14.250 --> 22:16.469
So? I let you out of the freezer.
We're even.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.609
- What did you do to my car?
- What doos you mean?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.236
It should to hover much better now.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.239
It's a car.
It didn't hover at all before.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.947
How do you stop this thing?

22:51.787 --> 22:56.293
Oops. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti-proceed controls.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.836
Yeah, I noticed.
Stop is go.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.797
- Go is stop.
- Wait!

23:00.963 --> 23:04.137
Whyfor you do this?
Boovs and humans are friends!

23:04.300 --> 23:06.723
We're not friends.
You kidnapped my mom!

23:10.890 --> 23:11.982
Who is Mimom?

23:12.141 --> 23:13.233
No, "my" mom!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.735
What did I say?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.317
- I knows how to find her.
- How?

23:21.483 --> 23:24.032
That information is at
Boov Central Command.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.867
- At the Great Antenna.
- What?

23:26.030 --> 23:28.283
In Paris! Now let me to inside!

23:28.449 --> 23:29.575
Paris.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.745
- Then promise.
- What?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.506
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt.

23:37.499 --> 23:41.254
I promise! But if you do not wish
to be capturing, it must be now!

23:45.674 --> 23:47.017
Fine. Get in.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.915
<i>Oui, oui,</i> Pig!
Paris, here we come.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.743
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom.

24:29.551 --> 24:34.398
Okay. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.233
<i>Destination entered: Antarctica.</i>

24:39.728 --> 24:40.980
Hey, what are you doing?

24:41.438 --> 24:43.111
How did that happen?

24:43.273 --> 24:45.947
Keep your Boov paws off my car!

24:47.569 --> 24:48.616
Whoa!

24:50.698 --> 24:52.371
Your vehicle is infested.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.457
It's not infested. He's my pet.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.963
His name is Pig. Don't touch him.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.624
Now he is vibrating.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.383
Is he going to explode?

25:01.542 --> 25:03.544
No! He's just purring.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.008
Why do you haves this thing?

25:05.170 --> 25:08.299
Is it useful? Does it give meat or milk?

25:08.465 --> 25:10.138
What? No!

25:10.300 --> 25:13.645
You just have pets for fun
and companionship.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.398
You has me for companion on the ship.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.685
Yeah, well, Pig is better.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.319
If cat is "Pig," what is your name?

25:36.368 --> 25:39.167
Gratuity Tucci.
But my friends call me "Tip."

25:39.580 --> 25:42.174
- Tip.
- I said "my friends."

25:42.332 --> 25:45.336
But we are friends.
All humans and Boov.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.004
Captain Smek has decided.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.263
Captain Smek is an idiot.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.178
Untrue!

25:50.340 --> 25:54.220
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away.

25:55.012 --> 25:58.016
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher?

25:58.932 --> 26:02.436
<i>Long ago, our enemy, the Gorg...</i>

26:02.603 --> 26:05.277
<i>invited the Boov to a peace meeting.</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:14.498
<i>But Smek wisely fled in terror.</i>

26:14.656 --> 26:17.500
<i>And he took a great trophy: the Shusher.</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:18.876
Run away!

26:20.913 --> 26:22.836
<i>Why is it called the "Shusher"?</i>

26:23.624 --> 26:24.624
Shush!

26:25.626 --> 26:26.843
Whatever.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.842
Seriously?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.721
You guys had to ruin the Statue Of Liberty?

27:09.878 --> 27:10.878
"Statue of Smek."

27:11.004 --> 27:12.847
You will not get away with this.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.257
Boov Patrol!

27:14.508 --> 27:15.555
They are looking for you!

27:15.717 --> 27:16.717
Oh, no.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.067
Oh, no!

27:34.736 --> 27:35.828
What's that?

27:39.867 --> 27:40.867
Hey!

27:40.868 --> 27:43.337
Don't distract the driver!

27:51.670 --> 27:54.423
Aha! Busta Lime.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.305
"Busta Lime."

28:02.389 --> 28:03.561
Owpain!

28:03.724 --> 28:04.771
Owpain.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.658
Okay. Pee break.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.202
I, too, has to break pee.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.961
Or, as you calls it, the "number one."

28:25.120 --> 28:27.122
- We also has the "number two."
- Okay.

28:27.289 --> 28:29.166
- And the "number three."
- Okay!

28:29.333 --> 28:31.381
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.170
It would not be safe for you.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.714
We only doos it once a year.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.258
I would not call it a holiday...

28:37.424 --> 28:39.893
- but you doos need to take the day off.
- That's enough!

28:42.012 --> 28:44.982
You can't come in here.
This is the girls' room.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.406
Do not eat the blue mints!

28:58.779 --> 29:01.749
Thankfully, there is a
large bowl of lemonade.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.462
Do not drink the lemonade!

29:08.872 --> 29:10.249
Be out in a second.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.009
We're going to Paris!

29:14.711 --> 29:15.803
Going to see my mom!

29:18.882 --> 29:20.350
Takes your time!

29:26.431 --> 29:27.853
Ant-arc-tica.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.186
Here I come!

29:30.352 --> 29:31.352
Fugitive Boov.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.864
Hold still for arresting!

29:34.022 --> 29:35.524
Best friend Kyle!

29:35.691 --> 29:37.034
I am not your friend!

29:37.192 --> 29:39.741
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.825
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!

29:47.327 --> 29:49.000
What is the purpose of your face?

29:49.830 --> 29:50.456
Owpain.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.044
You were gonna ditch me?

29:52.207 --> 29:53.207
- No!
- Liar!

29:53.333 --> 29:54.710
I never lie!

29:54.876 --> 29:55.876
Yes, you do!

29:56.295 --> 29:57.342
And you know how I know?

29:57.504 --> 30:00.883
Because every time you lie,
you turn green!

30:01.049 --> 30:02.551
I doos not. I...

30:03.218 --> 30:04.218
Poomp.

30:06.680 --> 30:11.402
Open the door, you lying,
frog-faced squishy toy!

30:12.019 --> 30:13.145
Stop! I need your...

30:15.564 --> 30:17.157
You promised to help me find my mom!

30:17.316 --> 30:18.818
Then I un-promise!

30:18.984 --> 30:20.531
That's not how it works!

30:21.028 --> 30:23.281
You have to help me get to Paris.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.290
I will not!

30:27.326 --> 30:28.794
Stop! I need your...

30:33.957 --> 30:35.004
I must hide!

30:35.167 --> 30:38.137
I am speaking the English at you.
Whyfor do you not understands me?

30:38.295 --> 30:41.424
I "understands." I just don't care.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.300
- Freezing!
- Look out!

30:51.892 --> 30:52.892
Come on!

30:55.103 --> 30:58.698
Stop! I need your password.

31:01.943 --> 31:02.614
No!

31:02.778 --> 31:03.778
Go!

31:22.172 --> 31:24.675
All I wanted was his password.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.225
This is not a sustainable friendship model.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.217
So...

31:59.376 --> 32:04.177
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.008
Anybody?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.097
You. The purple one.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.844
Not that purple. The other purple.
The other purple.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.391
That one.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.392
Yes, you!

32:16.768 --> 32:18.361
So, where is he?

32:18.728 --> 32:20.025
We do not know, sir.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.532
What? This is number one disaster!

32:22.691 --> 32:25.035
His message must not reach the Gorg.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.743
This planet was hard to find,
and I will not abandon it!

32:28.905 --> 32:32.159
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.756
So soothing.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.761
Aha! Officer Kyle!

32:43.920 --> 32:46.890
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.267
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?

32:49.426 --> 32:50.598
Yes.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.637
Joyful exclamation!

32:55.182 --> 32:56.775
And where is he?

32:58.268 --> 33:00.316
There is a tiny problem.

33:03.148 --> 33:06.322
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.617
Well, before I got the password...

33:10.489 --> 33:12.412
I erased him.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.415
<i>Come party. Come party. Come party.</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:25.295
- Quit it!
- Sorry.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.590
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.804
It crawls with Boov.

33:29.966 --> 33:33.015
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there?

33:33.178 --> 33:36.273
Not really. But I have hope.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.605
You are bad at math.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.518
Excuse me?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.436
I got an "A" in geometry.

33:41.603 --> 33:42.946
I am only saying...

33:43.104 --> 33:45.607
Boov are superior in this way.

33:45.941 --> 33:49.946
If probability for success
falls below 50%...

33:51.613 --> 33:54.162
Boov give up. You do not.

33:54.324 --> 33:55.324
Exactly!

33:56.201 --> 33:57.669
Enough with the ripping!

33:57.827 --> 33:59.124
Okay, Okay.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.164
Tell you what. Let's have some tuneage.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.219
What is that?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.134
Boov song.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.302
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."

34:14.469 --> 34:15.469
Very big hit.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.813
No, no, no! Not in my car.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.350
Driver gets to pick.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.985
This is not even music.
This is just noise.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.996
Involuntary physical response.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.583
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.716
If you want humans to not hate you...

34:44.873 --> 34:47.252
you could start by liking
some of our stuff.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.885
Confusion. What is happening to my body?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.428
It's called dancing!

34:56.594 --> 34:58.518
Boov do not dancing!

34:58.680 --> 35:01.183
I can tell.
But you're getting the hang of it!

35:01.349 --> 35:03.192
How long before this kills me?

35:03.351 --> 35:05.945
I am not in control of my own extremities!

35:06.104 --> 35:08.232
That's it. Work it!

35:08.398 --> 35:09.695
I do not want it to work!

35:09.858 --> 35:10.858
You know what?

35:11.401 --> 35:13.199
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."

35:13.361 --> 35:15.284
Shake your Boov thang.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.037
It is shaking in a most undignified way!

35:18.867 --> 35:22.371
Oh, no! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

35:22.704 --> 35:24.627
This is not how a Boov behaves!

35:24.789 --> 35:26.416
I am overheated with shame!

35:26.583 --> 35:28.381
- I must cool my core!
- Wait!

35:28.543 --> 35:30.966
- What are you doing?
- I will returning!

35:31.713 --> 35:32.930
We were having fun!

35:33.715 --> 35:34.716
Oh!

35:40.430 --> 35:41.431
Oh?

35:52.067 --> 35:53.740
<i>Come on, Mom. It's just snow!</i>

35:53.902 --> 35:55.825
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

35:56.905 --> 35:58.157
<i>Our first snow!</i>

36:01.409 --> 36:02.581
<i>Are you okay?</i>

36:02.744 --> 36:03.916
<i>I'm sending this to-</i>

36:05.121 --> 36:06.964
My temperature is back to happiness.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.423
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge-ment...

36:10.585 --> 36:13.179
I have brought you delicious snacking.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.432
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!

36:18.093 --> 36:20.642
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs.

36:20.804 --> 36:21.930
Where have you been?

36:22.097 --> 36:23.269
You were gone forever!

36:23.431 --> 36:25.104
That is not accurate. "Forever" is...

36:25.266 --> 36:27.485
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!

36:27.644 --> 36:29.612
Or I don't know!

36:29.771 --> 36:32.524
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that!

36:32.691 --> 36:34.659
Put yourself in my shoes!

36:34.818 --> 36:36.536
How could I wears your shoes?

36:36.695 --> 36:37.992
My pods are too small.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.371
It's an expression!

36:39.531 --> 36:42.785
It means try to feel how
someone else feels.

36:42.951 --> 36:46.876
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.793
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.462
But when I founded you,
you were already alone...

36:53.628 --> 36:55.380
so I thinks it is normal for you.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.050
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.816
Is this normal for humanspersons?

37:06.975 --> 37:11.981
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.320
No, none of this is normal!

37:14.482 --> 37:17.361
Don't you get it?
You ruined everything!

37:17.527 --> 37:21.748
I was finally happy here...
There, where I lived.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.249
With my mom.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.036
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in?

37:26.202 --> 37:27.670
How long that took?

37:27.829 --> 37:30.002
7th-grade girls are mean!

37:30.165 --> 37:32.338
Yes, I sees that!
I did not realize!

37:32.500 --> 37:35.845
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.722
Stop saying that!

37:37.881 --> 37:40.259
She's just "my" mom.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.519
Not yours. Mine.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.100
How do you not understand this?

37:45.263 --> 37:48.767
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?

37:50.018 --> 37:51.861
That could not to happen.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.022
Boov are not having mimoms.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.905
Boov don't have families.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.038
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.879
So, your mimom...

38:10.038 --> 38:12.882
is a very important humansperson to you.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.715
More important than others.

38:15.877 --> 38:19.927
To not belong with her
causes you being sad.

38:23.718 --> 38:27.222
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.

38:27.388 --> 38:31.393
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.610
Well, sometimes it's both.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.197
So, you are sad-mad.

38:52.747 --> 38:56.126
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.309
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.101
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?

39:09.430 --> 39:10.602
I got nothing!

39:11.766 --> 39:13.894
Please, come on!
I need ideas!

39:14.060 --> 39:16.062
You! The purple one.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.609
Oh, come on!

39:21.776 --> 39:22.777
So?

39:22.944 --> 39:27.916
We could type in random
numbers and letters?

39:28.992 --> 39:30.118
I like it!

39:31.286 --> 39:33.960
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.

39:34.122 --> 39:35.294
Away!

39:36.291 --> 39:38.669
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us.

39:38.835 --> 39:39.927
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.597
<i>And that is why
we keep running away.</i>

39:47.135 --> 39:48.135
Whoa.

39:48.261 --> 39:50.184
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.598
Because they are Gorg.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.108
We calls Gorg the "takers"...

39:54.267 --> 39:57.487
because if you has something,
they takes it.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.443
Like, if you has a sandwich.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.778
Or a planet.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.783
No, no. I get it.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.819
But they're not coming
to this planet, right?

40:04.986 --> 40:06.533
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.996
The Big Brain Boov will to fix my mistake.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.001
But I will still be very punished.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.787
We has a rule.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.376
Nine mistakes and you are out.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.337
How many mistakes do you have?

40:19.042 --> 40:20.294
62.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.142
When I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.013
Boov do not do telling jokes.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.977
It's not that hard.
I'll teach you.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.139
Knock, knock.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.356
You would say, "Who's there?"

40:39.687 --> 40:40.859
You are there.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.524
No, just ask me.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.690
Who is there?

40:43.691 --> 40:46.319
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

40:46.486 --> 40:49.365
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"

40:49.530 --> 40:50.531
Let's just do it.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.996
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.911
The interrupting cow.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.501
- The interrupting cow...
- Moo!

40:57.664 --> 40:59.712
You did not let me finish my response.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.878
- I was to say, "The interrupting co..."
- Moo!

41:03.044 --> 41:04.591
You did it again.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.554
That is the joke.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.560
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...

41:11.719 --> 41:13.721
and therefore interrupts me!

41:13.888 --> 41:16.186
- I know. That's why it's funny.
- Moo!

41:16.349 --> 41:17.942
- Let me fi...
- Moo!

41:18.101 --> 41:19.821
- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.399
- Knock it off!
- Moo!

41:21.562 --> 41:23.610
- Don't make me get out more tape!
- Moo!

41:32.073 --> 41:34.451
So many Boovs!

41:35.201 --> 41:36.578
I said this was dumbness.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.372
I said I am doomed.
But doos you listen? No!

41:39.539 --> 41:40.539
Oh, that's enough!

41:40.581 --> 41:42.424
You are driving me to the crazy!

41:42.583 --> 41:45.803
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.765
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.927
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!

41:52.093 --> 41:53.891
All we have to do
is sneak into the city...

41:54.053 --> 41:56.897
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom...

41:57.056 --> 41:59.104
and then sneak out again. See?

41:59.267 --> 42:02.316
But it still will not work
because my face is known.

42:02.478 --> 42:06.949
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.282
What if I could fix that?

42:25.460 --> 42:26.507
Hold still.

42:28.087 --> 42:30.636
First, a little beauty mark.

42:31.466 --> 42:32.968
Letting me see.

42:33.134 --> 42:35.374
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.
- Give to me, give to me!

42:37.972 --> 42:40.976
It is like looking at a completed stranger!

42:41.142 --> 42:43.110
No, I'm not done. It's not even...

42:43.269 --> 42:46.318
You are a worker of
miraculous transformation!

42:46.481 --> 42:47.949
Who is this Boov?

42:48.107 --> 42:49.529
I do not know!

42:50.651 --> 42:51.868
All right, Oh.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.323
Owpain.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.511
<i>Express elevator departing.</i>

43:30.191 --> 43:31.191
Whoa!

43:31.359 --> 43:33.361
This is uber freaky.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.031
These are the smartest Boov you have?

43:36.739 --> 43:38.741
You must be very quiet.

43:38.908 --> 43:40.628
You do not want to break their concentra...

43:43.496 --> 43:44.588
<i>Come party. Come party.</i>

43:46.374 --> 43:47.421
Oh! What is it?

43:47.583 --> 43:50.587
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.673
But they have still not
figured out my password.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.273
- How is this possible?
- Wait a minute.

43:54.423 --> 43:57.347
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth'?

43:57.510 --> 43:58.932
To Smekland, yes!

43:59.095 --> 44:00.347
And what happens then?

44:02.849 --> 44:04.851
There will be no finding of Mimom!

44:05.768 --> 44:07.236
Then you've gotta fix this!

44:07.395 --> 44:08.692
Yes.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.190
Hurry!

44:11.357 --> 44:13.109
By to the way, is your skull flexible?

44:13.276 --> 44:14.072
- What?
- Never mind.

44:14.235 --> 44:15.675
It will be probably okay.
Hold still.

44:28.791 --> 44:29.963
Wow!

44:33.963 --> 44:35.590
30 seconds to doom.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.633
I shall input my password. It is...

44:37.800 --> 44:42.601
"My name is Oh and Captain Smek is great
and anyone who does not think that is a poomp 1."

44:42.763 --> 44:44.265
I wonder why no one guessed that.

44:44.432 --> 44:45.558
I do not know.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.815
- It didn't work?
- Impossible!

44:48.978 --> 44:49.978
That is password!

44:50.062 --> 44:52.235
That is...
Oh, no! Caps Lock.

44:59.614 --> 45:00.654
Come on, come on, come on!

45:00.656 --> 45:02.954
<i>Come party. Come party.
Come party. Come party.</i>

45:05.786 --> 45:07.254
<i>Come party. Come party.</i>

45:19.800 --> 45:20.801
Yes!

45:27.475 --> 45:29.477
Fa-da! It has worked.

45:29.644 --> 45:30.941
It worked!

45:31.103 --> 45:32.320
You did it, Oh!

45:35.816 --> 45:37.113
That was closeness.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.276
On your feet.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.162
You still have to find my mom.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.370
That is simplicity.
We shall now searching on...

45:43.532 --> 45:45.159
Lucy Tucci.

45:45.326 --> 45:47.294
"Lucy Tucci."

45:49.163 --> 45:50.881
Australia.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.178
Observe Mimom.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.177
That's not funny.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.717
This is not your mimom?

46:00.883 --> 46:01.883
Are you kidding?

46:02.468 --> 46:04.345
That's not her!

46:04.804 --> 46:05.896
Sure?

46:06.889 --> 46:08.232
<i>I know, I know. Okay?</i>

46:08.391 --> 46:09.911
<i>You've been saying that for two weeks.</i>

46:10.059 --> 46:11.060
<i>Please!</i>

46:11.227 --> 46:14.731
<i>She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin.</i>

46:14.897 --> 46:16.023
Mom.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.818
<i>So tell me where she is.</i>

46:18.985 --> 46:20.908
<i>Or find me a Boov who can.</i>

46:23.322 --> 46:24.323
<i>Please.</i>

46:25.241 --> 46:28.586
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.378
Gratuity Tucci? Whyfor...

46:32.540 --> 46:35.510
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

46:41.382 --> 46:44.056
I can't believe it!
My mom's in Australia!

46:44.218 --> 46:46.596
And I has cancelled my e-vite!

46:46.762 --> 46:48.764
I can finally come out of the hiding.

46:48.931 --> 46:49.932
Yes!

47:00.901 --> 47:03.120
Well, well, well.

47:05.448 --> 47:06.540
Hello?

47:07.366 --> 47:08.367
Hold my crown.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.536
And be very careful.
It's the only one.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.872
Well, well, well.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.959
Did you really think you could escape?

47:16.125 --> 47:19.470
Escape? No, no, no.

47:19.628 --> 47:20.971
You see, I was just coming to tell you...

47:21.130 --> 47:23.383
Despite your elaborate disguise...

47:23.924 --> 47:26.598
the computer recognized you as...

47:26.761 --> 47:29.105
the fugitive Boov!

47:33.309 --> 47:34.731
But he's a hero Boov now!

47:34.894 --> 47:37.488
Yes! I has fixed my mistake!

47:37.646 --> 47:40.274
Yes, but before that,
you has made your mistake.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.660
And many mistakes before that.

47:42.818 --> 47:46.118
- Wait, I have not...
- Many, many, many, many!

47:46.280 --> 47:47.280
Actually...

47:47.281 --> 47:49.625
Many mistakes before that.

47:50.326 --> 47:52.294
- So, I still has to erase you.
- Why?

47:52.453 --> 47:54.653
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again.

47:54.789 --> 47:57.633
- But I would not.
- But you might.

47:57.792 --> 47:58.588
But I would not.

47:58.751 --> 48:00.173
We could go round and round.
Let's do it again!

48:00.336 --> 48:01.462
- But I would not.
- But you might.

48:01.629 --> 48:03.427
- But I would not.
- I love this!

48:04.965 --> 48:07.593
- But I would not!
- Bored now.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.807
- But I would...
- Shush!

48:08.969 --> 48:09.969
Erase him!

48:12.431 --> 48:14.650
Drop the bubble guns!

48:14.809 --> 48:17.153
Or I will mess with this...

48:17.603 --> 48:19.446
gravity thingy.

48:19.605 --> 48:20.857
She is bluffing.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.947
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy.

48:24.985 --> 48:27.204
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

48:28.155 --> 48:29.156
But no problem.

48:29.323 --> 48:34.671
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.172
Excuse me?

48:37.832 --> 48:40.836
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.

48:44.505 --> 48:47.304
She figured it out!
Run for my life!

48:48.968 --> 48:51.016
Out of my way! I am captain!

49:06.193 --> 49:07.194
Grab on!

49:08.154 --> 49:09.406
Oh, no! I can't hold you!

49:10.156 --> 49:11.908
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!

49:13.033 --> 49:13.704
Let go.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.711
- What?
- Trust me.

49:22.334 --> 49:24.382
Sorry. It is my duty to run away first.

49:26.213 --> 49:26.884
Poomp.

49:27.047 --> 49:28.890
- What are you waiting for?
- I cannot touch.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.551
It will not work if I drive it.

49:31.385 --> 49:32.853
Fine. I'll drive.

49:38.517 --> 49:39.517
Owpain.

49:43.564 --> 49:45.157
You are terrible driver.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.343
Come on.

50:13.385 --> 50:14.728
Come on. Come on.

50:15.554 --> 50:16.100
Bon appétit.

50:16.222 --> 50:17.394
Oh, no, you don't!

50:17.556 --> 50:19.058
I am not paying for that.

50:37.409 --> 50:39.286
Come on, you stupid horse!

50:47.419 --> 50:48.762
Whoo, that was cl...

50:59.306 --> 51:00.307
This time I got you...

51:00.474 --> 51:02.147
and you cannot escape.

51:02.893 --> 51:03.985
<i>Fugitive Boov detected.</i>

51:04.144 --> 51:05.144
I was wrong.

51:10.317 --> 51:11.317
Jump!

51:11.443 --> 51:12.444
Oh, no!

51:24.665 --> 51:26.417
Look! I has found our car.

51:26.584 --> 51:27.585
Pig!

51:36.927 --> 51:39.180
I do not know whyfor you brought that.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.019
We already hads food in the car.

51:41.181 --> 51:43.183
It's not food, it's art.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.690
Then it is bad.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.981
Stars do not look like that.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.524
It's not about how they look.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.818
It's about how they feel.

51:52.192 --> 51:53.785
They feel hot.

51:54.945 --> 51:58.040
Okay, math whiz, how long
till we get to Australia?

51:58.198 --> 52:00.371
17.9348 hours.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.541
And then, Gratuity Tucci...

52:02.703 --> 52:04.171
will see Mimom.

52:06.790 --> 52:07.882
You hear that, Pig?

52:08.042 --> 52:10.716
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris...

52:10.878 --> 52:13.051
which you know she always wanted to do.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.215
Maybe we could both come back here.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.305
We do have a flying car now.

52:17.468 --> 52:20.062
How do you say "cat" in French?

52:20.554 --> 52:22.352
I think it's <i>"chat."</i>

52:32.524 --> 52:34.652
What is the purpose of your face?

52:38.364 --> 52:40.207
I has confusion.

52:41.867 --> 52:44.416
I do not wish to be erased.

52:45.245 --> 52:47.748
But maybe Captain Smek is right.

52:48.248 --> 52:52.549
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes.

52:53.087 --> 52:54.088
Probably.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.256
That is not making me feel better.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.096
Nobody's perfect.

52:58.258 --> 53:02.604
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human.

53:02.763 --> 53:05.061
That is not what makes you Boov.

53:08.227 --> 53:09.945
Gratuity Tucci...

53:10.104 --> 53:12.106
before we came...

53:12.272 --> 53:15.993
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.

53:16.485 --> 53:19.329
That the humans were
just like the animals...

53:19.488 --> 53:21.786
and that we could to make them better...

53:21.949 --> 53:23.701
teach to them.

53:23.867 --> 53:28.873
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.922
It is what we thought.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.465
But I am thinking now...

53:35.838 --> 53:38.307
that we were thinking wrong.

53:38.465 --> 53:41.389
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

53:41.552 --> 53:45.932
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.442
To Earthland.

53:48.934 --> 53:52.859
So I am saying
the sorry to you...

53:53.021 --> 53:54.648
Gratuity Tucci.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.785
Call me Tip.

54:11.165 --> 54:15.090
It was a new home, a new country.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.970
I tried to make friends at school...

54:17.129 --> 54:20.975
but I was this nerd from Barbados.

54:21.133 --> 54:24.182
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry.

54:24.344 --> 54:25.891
Yeah, I did.

54:26.513 --> 54:29.357
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...

54:29.516 --> 54:32.065
they were not happy to see me.

54:33.645 --> 54:36.740
The true is, among Boov,
I do not fit in.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.076
I fit out.

54:41.987 --> 54:44.160
She is so amazing.

54:44.323 --> 54:46.451
She saved up everything she had...

54:46.617 --> 54:49.587
so we could move
and things would be better for us.

54:49.912 --> 54:52.791
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.

54:57.753 --> 55:00.597
"My name is Captain Smek.
Shush, shush, shush."

55:00.756 --> 55:06.263
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out."

56:33.807 --> 56:34.899
How did they find us?

56:35.058 --> 56:36.310
I do not know!

56:42.983 --> 56:45.031
Wait. They're not attacking.

56:45.193 --> 56:47.241
Because they are running away.

56:48.405 --> 56:49.827
Why are they running away?

56:49.990 --> 56:51.742
There can only be one reason.

57:04.963 --> 57:05.963
Gorg.

57:06.465 --> 57:09.309
This makes no sense.
I stopped the message.

57:10.260 --> 57:11.637
Gorg cannot to finding us.

57:12.346 --> 57:13.643
Then how did they?

57:13.805 --> 57:16.024
There must be some other reason!

57:20.437 --> 57:21.939
Oh, behind us!

57:22.105 --> 57:23.857
Engage weapons system.

57:24.024 --> 57:25.526
We have a weapons system?

57:30.322 --> 57:32.575
Go, Burrito Torpedo!

57:35.160 --> 57:36.160
Yes!

57:38.080 --> 57:40.833
We've been hit!
We're losing Grape Escape!

57:40.999 --> 57:42.421
We lost Tangerine Twist!

57:42.584 --> 57:45.633
If we lose Busta Lime, I cannot control!

57:45.837 --> 57:47.589
Click and ticket.
We are to crash!

57:47.756 --> 57:48.756
Oh!

58:06.566 --> 58:07.566
No, no, no.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.244
Slushious! No!

58:11.613 --> 58:13.206
Don't just stand there! Help!

58:14.741 --> 58:16.414
Come on, come on, come on!

58:16.576 --> 58:18.920
Slushious! No!

58:26.211 --> 58:26.962
She's gone.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.130
We are doomed.

58:28.296 --> 58:29.798
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.093
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.

58:40.934 --> 58:41.981
A Gorg ship!

58:42.144 --> 58:43.704
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.

58:43.770 --> 58:46.740
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car.

58:46.982 --> 58:49.826
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.
They are metric.

58:49.985 --> 58:52.488
We're not getting this close
and giving up.

58:52.654 --> 58:53.746
- Come on.
- No!

58:54.740 --> 58:55.957
Always with the running towards danger.

58:56.241 --> 58:59.495
Stop being such a Boov.
It's our only chance. Come on.

59:02.581 --> 59:05.175
This has low probability of success!

59:12.090 --> 59:13.637
- Let's go.
- Wait!

59:13.925 --> 59:14.972
For what?

59:15.427 --> 59:17.100
For you to change your mind.

59:17.429 --> 59:18.430
Come on.

59:34.988 --> 59:35.989
There's no pilot.

59:36.156 --> 59:37.783
It is just a drone.

59:41.369 --> 59:42.871
That could have been badness.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.540
But we are not safety.

59:44.706 --> 59:47.129
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough.

59:49.377 --> 59:50.674
Can you use any of this?

59:50.837 --> 59:52.054
Broken.

59:52.214 --> 59:53.340
Useless.

59:53.507 --> 59:55.509
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.

59:58.470 --> 59:59.847
What is it?

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.306
It is Gorg super-chip!

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.360
Why is it called a super-chip?

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:06.691
It is mostly marketing.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.526
But it is key...

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:12.363
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.528
So we can never fight them with equaltude.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.196
Can we use it to fix Slushious?

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.661
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:19.871
Yes!

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.591
It was low probability of success.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.721
Some Boov you are.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:36.507
Quickly.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.514
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.724
"My" mom.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.058
That is the thing I said.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.519
I knew this would all work out!

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.611
You were awesome!

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.896
We're gonna find my mom...

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.907
you're gonna show everybody
the super-chip and be a big hero...

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.444
and even Captain Smek will have to...

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.578
That's a lot of people.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:08.215
- Bye, Boov!
- Get lost!

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:24.644
Wow. You guys really are good
at running away.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:25.807
Yes.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.943
Yes, we are.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.443
Look, over there!

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.112
That's where we saw my mom!

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.169
Hurry up, it is the last ship!

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.304
It's okay, Pig.
I'll be back with Mom.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.175
We're almost there!

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.176
Over here.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.269
- What?
- Hurry!

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:13.029
I don't understand.
She's in there?

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:16.649
Yes.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.702
Tell me the truth.

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.204
There is no time.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.990
You can come with me.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.454
You will be safety.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:30.293
My mom's not on that ship, is she?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.339
You promised to help me find her,
and you're leaving?

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.721
- You lied to me.
- No!

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.974
A lie is a bad thing.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.226
I did a thing so you can live.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.854
I'm not going.
My mom is here.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.355
You will never find her.

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:48.891
It is 100%.

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.526
Staying now does not make hope.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.733
Gorg mothership will be here soon.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.031
It destroys planets.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.824
- We must run away now!
- No!

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.236
It is true.

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:03.872
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple, simple things.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.579
I am saving you!
I am being your friend.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:09.210
No, you're just running away.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:11.667
You don't leave your family.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.110
But you can't understand that...

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.379
because you're just a Boov!

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.428
You've never been my friend.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.220
Wait!

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.519
<i>Final escape pod departing.</i>

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.981
I hate upon the Gorg!
They are always finding us!

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.566
The Gorg mothership!

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:35.917
We are doomed!

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.081
Run away!

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.796
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.764
It is the fugitive Boov!

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.975
He is running towards the danger!

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.305
Stop him!

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:05.492
Undo!

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:27.348
Captain, we are achieving
new highest speeds!

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:31.477
What has you done?
What is that thing?

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.809
It is Gorg super-chip.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.305
What?

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.562
Gorg drone crashed...

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.022
and I ran to it
and I found the chip.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:39.856
Enough.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:41.862
You ran to a Gorg?

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.199
He runs towards the danger?

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:46.701
What kind of Boov is he?

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.830
He is like a Super Boov.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:52.036
No, no, no.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.825
He is not a Super Boov.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:57.838
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship, and you know who it is.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.373
You're looking at him.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.541
I invented running away.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.008
And look at this.
I have the Shusher.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.381
I am your captain.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.049
But you are not good captain.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.262
What?

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:13.770
You telled us these things,
and we all believed them.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.722
I believed them.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:19.393
But then I met a humansperson.

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:22.399
And she is not like you said.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.863
She is brave and smart...

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:30.404
and cares about other humanspersons.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:34.746
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.912
She even cares about me.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.086
And I've done very little to earn that.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.961
The Boov may be superior in many ways...

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.252
Yeah.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.473
...but not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.145
Big deal!

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.556
I have had enough. Shush!

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:03.649
That is enough shushing.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.654
How dare you shush a shushing!

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.612
Oh is right.
We need a new captain.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.911
I thinks it should be Oh!

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.118
Me? No.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.748
No! He cannot be captain.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.160
I have the Shusher. I am captain!

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.326
Not anymore!

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.081
He will not know how to operate it!

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:24.795
It is very complicated.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.438
Heavy on one end, light on the other.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.460
Shush!

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:29.633
Booyah!

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:32.632
No, I am not a Leader Boov.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.142
I makes far too many mistakes.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:37.436
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.605
For examples...

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:43.314
my mistake is not being your friend.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.486
All hail Captain Oh!

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:56.280
I saw who did that!

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:57.994
I hold grudges, you know!

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.467
Oh, you're the best!

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.129
Want me to host party, Oh?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.527
Go away.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.361
No, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there?"

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.866
Then I am to be saying...

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.241
"Moo!"

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.401
Oh!

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.743
I can't believe it!

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.950
But I saw your ship leave!

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:09.960
But you came back!
What are you doing here?

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.625
It is where I belongs.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.590
You and Pigcat are my friends.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.922
And alsos, too...

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.965
I gave you a promise.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.222
He's my friend.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.727
Thank you.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.812
Mom.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.400
Tippy. My beautiful girl.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.237
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.027
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:06.323
Mom, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:12.416
They are still looking.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:30.930
Gorg are not the takers.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.266
Boov are.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.148
We must demonstrate our affections later.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.157
There is still one problem.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:44.114
Excuse me, what is that?

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:47.121
That is Gorg mothership.
It is here to destroy the planet.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.688
It's going to destroy the planet?

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:56.331
Yes. But I haves a plan.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:11.929
Oh?

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.188
What are you doing?

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.852
I am sorry.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.693
Tip cannot come into the out now.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.823
I am fixing my mistake.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:26.536
Oh! You can't do this on your own!

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:28.412
Maybe not.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.619
But I haves hope.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:34.627
No!

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:35.911
Stop, no!

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.498
Please don't do this by yourself!

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:45.759
No! Don't!

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:48.178
Oh!

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:10.071
Stop!

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.368
Look!

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:22.834
Hey!

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:31.975
Gorg!

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.804
It is useless to yell.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.314
Gorg!

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.070
They're not gonna see him.

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:48.405
It's not gonna work!

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:50.323
Merry Christmas.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.954
- Now?
- Just open it.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.951
Thank you, sweetheart, but what...

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:58.369
What are you doing?

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.630
Distracting the driver.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:37.416
It worked! The ship's stopping!

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.379
It's not gonna stop in time!

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.809
Stop faster!

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.845
He's gotta get out of there!

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.516
Mom, help me with this thing!

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.317
Oh!

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:12.817
Oh!

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.324
Run!

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:15.283
Tip!

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:16.493
Stop!

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:17.907
Tip!

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:21.887
Mom!

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:54.511
Oh!

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:01.431
You're alive.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.938
But you scared me so bad!

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.598
You were scared?

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.858
I almost made a number three.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.017
Not too hard!

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.604
It is still a possibility.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.069
What was all that?

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:26.865
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:31.582
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation...

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.042
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.256
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.920
What was in that thing?

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.212
Gorg family.

01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:45.640
It is entire next generation.

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.267
All of them?

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:49.269
All of them.

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.903
No wonder they've been chasing you.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:05.111
Not "they," "he."

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:09.123
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.283
That is why rock was so important.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.452
Without it, he was alonely...

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:16.042
and would someday be extinctly...

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:19.254
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.635
and physically violent.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.762
He was just like humansgirl.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:28.809
He was sad-mad.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:37.981
Thanking you.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:40.821
Thanking you!
High hand touching.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:42.652
Yeah, give it here. High hand touching.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:45.159
Up high! You are too slow.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.946
High hand touching! That hurt.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:15.514
Pigcat!

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.183
Hey, Oh!

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.354
Hello, friend Kyle.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.443
I have that same color.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.482
- Hi, Mimom.
- Hi, Oh.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:26.946
Awesome party, Oh!

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:29.953
Parties are so much more fun
when other people show up.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.285
Is it time to pick it up a level?

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.448
Yes!

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:35.993
This is gonna be sweet!

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.162
Drop it like it has a high temperature!

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.390
Oh, no!

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:59.399
What is happening to my body?

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.732
Shake your Boov thang!

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.240
My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:19.253
<i>I has a new start in a new home
with new friends.</i>

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:23.541
<i>And now, every day is best day ever!</i>

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.364
<i>You are all invited
to a party, party, party.</i>

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.072
<i>Just head to the Milky Way.
Turn right at the Big Dipper.</i>

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:51.702
<i>Third planet from the Sun.</i>

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.237
<i>Look for my balloons!</i>

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:54.700
<i>Come party!</i>

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.791
Everybody, smile!
