19:48.250 --> 19:49.540
No, no, I am not.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.710
I-I am the new black voice
of the alt-right.

19:52.710 --> 19:54.460
Yeah, do you know Ted Nugent
follows me?

19:54.460 --> 19:55.830
Who?

19:55.830 --> 19:58.710
I want you to picture Satan,

19:58.710 --> 20:01.380
but he's from Michigan
and he wears a cowboy hat.

20:01.380 --> 20:04.080
Follows me.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.750
The bottom line is,
the Internet is a minefield,

20:07.750 --> 20:11.420
and there was just no room
for error.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.170
And for that reason,

20:13.170 --> 20:16.420
it's hard not to resent being
born into the Digital Age.

20:16.420 --> 20:19.420
It seems like such
a huge disadvantage.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.500
Oh, oh, my God!
I love this song!

20:22.500 --> 20:24.120
-Ah, me too!
-It's, um...

20:24.120 --> 20:25.710
-What is -- Wait.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.580
Oh, my God. It's literally
on the tip of my tongue.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.330
It's the guy.
-This is gonna drive me insane.

20:29.330 --> 20:30.790
Hold on.
-Wait, no, no, no, wait!

20:30.790 --> 20:32.380
I got it, I got it.

20:32.380 --> 20:34.920
Relax. Relax!
It's searching.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.250
-Ah.
-Oh!

20:43.580 --> 20:45.880
And sometimes it felt like
the only thing

20:45.880 --> 20:48.040
you could really think
or say about it

20:48.040 --> 20:51.500
was "what a time to be alive."
