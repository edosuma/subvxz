00:21.166 --> 00:24.098
The prosthetics are lined
with a carbon powder.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.255
The system's database
won't find a match.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.867
Well, then, let's begin.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.500
You've cleared their system.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.832
We're United States agents.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.333
Lock down your vault.
You're being robbed.

00:43.499 --> 00:44.498
Sloane!

00:44.499 --> 00:46.765
Hold your fire!

00:46.766 --> 00:49.266
We've rigged the lower level
with enough C-4

00:49.332 --> 00:51.199
to level the entire city block.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.393
So I suggest that you both
lower your guns.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.164
You, my dear,

00:56.165 --> 00:58.665
you'll be driving me
out of here.

01:20.432 --> 01:22.598
Stand down.

01:23.698 --> 01:25.864
Let Bristow leave
with the suspect.

01:25.865 --> 01:28.524
He's holding the detonator.
We have a clear shot.

01:28.665 --> 01:32.619
No. One move and his operative
will detonate the explosive.

01:32.765 --> 01:34.897
He's got the area
under surveillance.

01:34.898 --> 01:36.365
That means let Sloane go.

01:36.366 --> 01:39.763
Don't tail him until
we get this stuff defused.

02:01.732 --> 02:04.197
There's a current
running through here.

02:04.198 --> 02:06.755
If we clip the wires,
we'll break the circuit.

02:06.864 --> 02:08.062
There's a fail-safe.

02:08.064 --> 02:10.586
The only way
is to disrupt the electronics.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.697
We need the water cannon.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.830
The detonator operates
on a frequency.

02:13.831 --> 02:16.353
Wouldn't it be faster to
find that and jam it?

02:16.465 --> 02:19.624
But accessing the frequency
might trigger an explosion.

02:19.731 --> 02:22.526
There's got to be
a way to block it.

02:22.630 --> 02:24.197
Not unless you have some way

02:24.198 --> 02:26.698
to encase a detonator
in concrete.

02:28.764 --> 02:32.389
This is Agent Vaughn.
Get me the bank manager now.

02:36.497 --> 02:38.329
I told you not to come after me.

02:38.330 --> 02:41.625
I warned you that I will
kill you if you interfere.

02:41.731 --> 02:44.719
If you knew what I have in here,
what my plans are...

02:44.831 --> 02:46.629
This is bigger than SD-6,

02:46.630 --> 02:48.997
than the CIA...

02:48.998 --> 02:52.986
than you being deceived by me,
than me being betrayed by you.

02:54.397 --> 02:55.996
If things were different...

02:55.997 --> 02:58.827
The safe.
It's a Friedlin Model 42-C.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.096
Okay, Friedlin.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.262
Friedlin. Friedlin Number 9.

03:02.263 --> 03:05.058
Friedlin.
Okay. Got it.

03:05.197 --> 03:08.185
High-density concrete
surrounded by heavy-gauge steel.

03:08.330 --> 03:10.463
- Will it block the signal?
- Depends on the detonator.

03:10.464 --> 03:12.463
- How big's the antenna?
- Inch and a half.

03:12.464 --> 03:13.962
Means it's transmitting at...

03:13.963 --> 03:15.762
the speed of light
times one-fourth.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.196
- Marshall!
- Three gigahertz.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.992
You should have enough
so the signal can't get through.

03:20.097 --> 03:21.829
- Should have or have?
- Have.

03:21.830 --> 03:25.818
Tell Kendall to start tracking
Sydney. She'll be in a Focus.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.528
- You know what model?
- ZX5.

03:27.529 --> 03:28.895
- What color?
- Blue. Why?

03:28.896 --> 03:31.396
Just curious.
Thinking about getting one.

03:31.496 --> 03:33.795
Lower it, get some
big tires, rims.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.296
Gold rims.
And... hello?

03:44.429 --> 03:45.562
Syd?

03:45.563 --> 03:49.290
We shielded the detonator.
The bomb cannot be triggered.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.089
A team will intercept
your car in five minutes.

03:59.029 --> 04:00.195
Change of plans.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.696
E.T.A.... five minutes.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.627
The CIA has a hit list.

04:06.628 --> 04:11.287
35 people worldwide its agents
are allowed to kill.

04:11.429 --> 04:13.929
35 out of 6 billion.

04:14.062 --> 04:16.095
You're one of them.

04:16.096 --> 04:17.793
Which means when I kill you,

04:17.795 --> 04:20.386
I won't even be
breaking the law.

04:23.962 --> 04:26.462
You jump, you die.

05:05.928 --> 05:09.189
Officials with Amcorp are hiding
behind Swiss banking laws

05:09.295 --> 05:11.493
to avoid telling us
what Sloane stole.

05:11.494 --> 05:13.460
For the moment,
his trail's cold.

05:13.461 --> 05:15.693
In other words,
we don't have a plan.

05:15.694 --> 05:18.194
It's true, isn't it?
We've got nothing.

05:18.327 --> 05:21.225
May I remind you that Sloane
was last in your custody?

05:21.327 --> 05:24.349
I was in his custody.
He was holding hostages.

05:24.494 --> 05:27.153
You had the option to take
him out. You chose not to.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.760
I chose not to
incinerate 300 people.

05:29.828 --> 05:31.793
You think I made
the wrong choice?

05:31.794 --> 05:33.593
We should stick to what we know.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.923
Sloane is holding Caplan for the
purpose of building a weapon.

05:37.027 --> 05:40.117
Presumably what he took
from Amcorp is helping him.

05:40.227 --> 05:42.426
We don't know,
because we lost Sloane.

05:42.427 --> 05:47.155
Because he had something we
didn't. Satellite surveillance.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.158
If we'd followed him,
we would have caught him.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.692
Our satellites
were tasked elsewhere.

05:52.693 --> 05:55.159
We didn't take advantage
of the situation.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.459
No. We prioritized.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.326
What's the point
of strategizing...

05:58.327 --> 06:01.349
- We're doing everything we can!
- We're not!

06:03.626 --> 06:06.126
Not even close.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.592
I need a progress report.

06:13.593 --> 06:16.026
Caplan says he's a day away.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.092
We took the magnetometer
from Amcorp

06:18.093 --> 06:21.354
to expedite the construction
of the Rambaldi device.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.692
My flight is the day
after tomorrow.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.215
It needs to be
completed before then.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.726
I believe Caplan to be
a man of his word.

06:28.727 --> 06:30.492
Mr. Caplan is assisting us

06:30.493 --> 06:32.825
because he believes we're
holding his family.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.985
If what he's putting together
is as powerful as I believe,

06:36.093 --> 06:38.684
I don't want him near it
when it's operational.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.092
I'll conduct
the preliminary test myself.

06:41.093 --> 06:42.791
You do that.

06:42.792 --> 06:45.292
By tomorrow.

06:51.126 --> 06:52.725
I love the Zamboni.

06:52.726 --> 06:54.725
What, Zamboni's your
favorite part?

06:54.726 --> 06:58.283
No, coming home with you
is my favorite part.

06:59.759 --> 07:02.125
Zamboni was a close second.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.324
Hello?

07:07.325 --> 07:09.984
Hey. Kendall has something
he wants to show you.

07:10.092 --> 07:11.958
- Can it wait?
- Apparently not.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.658
He wants Sydney, too.

07:13.659 --> 07:16.318
- I haven't seen her.
- In bed with her, aren't you?

07:16.425 --> 07:19.050
I'm trying.
Find out what he wants.

07:19.158 --> 07:20.424
Kendall?

07:21.325 --> 07:23.825
Zamboni's your favorite part?

07:23.925 --> 07:26.618
Could you pay attention?
Can you hear me?

07:26.726 --> 07:29.024
No, coming home with you

07:29.025 --> 07:30.724
is my favorite part.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.091
Vaughn.

07:34.092 --> 07:37.455
Zamboni was a close second.

07:42.992 --> 07:45.492
We'll be there soon.

07:52.725 --> 07:56.020
Cleaning crew is on notice
to sweep the apartment.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.852
How can the apartment be bugged?
I have countermeasures.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.458
Will and I talk there.
He needs to be told.

08:02.491 --> 08:04.991
We need to know who
you've spoken with,

08:05.091 --> 08:07.523
what intelligence
might have been compromised.

08:07.524 --> 08:09.990
You need to compile
a list of every friend,

08:09.991 --> 08:13.445
serviceman, delivery guy
who has been in the apartment.

08:13.591 --> 08:16.091
Kendall's waiting.
I'll take this.

08:16.124 --> 08:17.623
You bugged the apartment?

08:17.624 --> 08:20.215
It's not like I broke in
and planted it myself.

08:20.324 --> 08:22.256
I made it.

08:22.257 --> 08:24.557
Here, if you take
a look right there,

08:24.558 --> 08:26.789
I soldered into
the circuit board.

08:26.790 --> 08:27.789
What is that?

08:27.790 --> 08:29.056
It's a Superman logo.

08:29.057 --> 08:34.010
Except this one's got an "M."
It's kind of my signature.

08:36.323 --> 08:40.017
When I used to work at SD-6,
I made it special for Sloane.

08:40.157 --> 08:43.520
It operates using a data adapter
which cloaks the signal,

08:43.623 --> 08:45.889
making it undetectable
by bug killers.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.823
I know. I know.
I'm that good.

08:47.824 --> 08:49.389
Uh, which is bad.

08:49.390 --> 08:52.117
Vaughn said he heard it
repeat his conversation.

08:52.223 --> 08:56.053
This is a burst transmitter.
It transmits to a receiver.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.656
Can you find out where
the conversations

08:58.657 --> 09:00.989
were being transmitted to?

09:00.990 --> 09:03.888
Well, if the transmitter records

09:03.990 --> 09:06.888
the phone number that it
sends the conversations to,

09:06.990 --> 09:08.656
I guess that it's possible.

09:08.657 --> 09:10.489
Then do it.

09:10.490 --> 09:12.990
"Please" would be nice.

09:13.923 --> 09:16.423
That's all right.
Never mind.

09:29.622 --> 09:32.610
Caplan finished
early this morning.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.421
The Rambaldi device is complete.

09:35.422 --> 09:37.922
I ran the test.

09:38.789 --> 09:41.482
I think you'll be pleased
with the results.

09:47.255 --> 09:50.050
When we agreed to combine
our resources, sir,

09:50.155 --> 09:53.587
you promised you'd show me
incredible things.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.688
But a neutron bomb designed
in the 16th century?

09:56.789 --> 09:59.550
Is that even
a theoretical possibility?

10:50.788 --> 10:53.288
Forgive the mode
of transportation.

10:53.421 --> 10:57.217
But a person in my position
cannot be too cautious.

10:57.321 --> 10:59.420
I understand.

10:59.421 --> 11:02.682
Our mutual friend,
Mr. Dreyfus,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.911
he sends his respects.

11:08.421 --> 11:11.580
Let me pay you the courtesy
of being blunt.

11:11.687 --> 11:14.414
I don't do business
with Americans.

11:16.921 --> 11:22.547
I'm a man with no country
and few alliances.

11:23.154 --> 11:25.654
All I have is a vision
of an enterprise

11:25.787 --> 11:28.446
that will influence
an existing world order

11:28.587 --> 11:30.753
that I believe to be corrupt.

11:30.754 --> 11:34.776
I'm looking for partners
who share that view.

11:34.887 --> 11:36.720
I am but a humble shepherd.

11:36.721 --> 11:39.219
Whose control of opium
along the silk Road

11:39.220 --> 11:42.447
is worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.952
In this part of the world,

11:45.953 --> 11:50.647
it's better to be practical
than visionary.

11:50.754 --> 11:53.652
Why should I invest
in your enterprise?

11:53.753 --> 11:56.980
Ah, that, my friend,
is a long discussion.

11:57.953 --> 12:00.851
First, my gift.

12:14.486 --> 12:17.974
It once belonged
to Khushal Khan Khattak.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.746
The great 17th-century
warrior-poet.

12:20.853 --> 12:26.683
He united our lands
and is a hero to my people.

12:28.987 --> 12:31.487
This is a treasure.

12:41.686 --> 12:44.618
Tell me more about
what you have planned.

12:59.485 --> 13:01.985
# I'm on a high, on a high #

13:03.086 --> 13:04.318
Hey.

13:04.319 --> 13:05.651
So, how's it going?

13:05.652 --> 13:06.684
I'm good.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.185
No, I mean about Will.

13:10.852 --> 13:13.613
Is this gonna turn into a thing?

13:13.719 --> 13:15.085
What's going on?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.517
Have you slept with him?

13:16.518 --> 13:18.985
- No, not yet.
- Will hasn't said a thing.

13:18.986 --> 13:22.713
He can't even look at me
anymore, he's so freaked out.

13:22.819 --> 13:25.217
# So I run or I fight #

13:25.218 --> 13:27.117
# And I crawl or I scream #

13:27.118 --> 13:28.484
# And I bleed #

13:28.485 --> 13:32.008
You know, Sydney, you've been
acting sort of weird lately.

13:32.118 --> 13:34.618
Really?

13:35.418 --> 13:38.179
And I thought you'd
been acting weird.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.375
I thought maybe it was
because of Will.

13:45.452 --> 13:47.417
You don't talk to me anymore.

13:47.418 --> 13:49.117
# I'm on a high #

13:49.118 --> 13:51.675
# There's nothing more to it #

13:51.784 --> 13:54.749
I'm sorry, Francie.

13:54.851 --> 13:57.084
I just get so caught up in work.

13:57.085 --> 14:01.210
Don't forget. We used to be
really good friends.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.884
You can talk to me.

14:10.085 --> 14:11.383
Hello?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.884
- Get in here now.
- Okay.

14:17.718 --> 14:19.383
Who was that?

14:19.384 --> 14:22.474
Someone from the bank.
There's a problem with a client.

14:22.584 --> 14:24.383
I have to go in.

14:24.384 --> 14:25.949
See you.

14:34.050 --> 14:36.383
Hello?
- They found the bugs.

14:36.384 --> 14:38.849
How should I proceed?

14:38.850 --> 14:41.543
They'll be looking
for our L.A. asset.

14:43.017 --> 14:44.682
Give them someone.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.515
I'll take care of it.

14:46.516 --> 14:49.538
- Send a copy to Kendall.
- Vaughn, is it Sloane?

14:49.683 --> 14:51.716
Did Marshall get a location?

14:51.717 --> 14:54.308
It's on an encrypted feed.
It was untraceable.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.716
But we got a lead
on Sloane another way.

14:56.717 --> 14:58.983
An asset outside Kandahar

14:58.984 --> 15:01.382
reported someone matching
Sloane's description

15:01.383 --> 15:04.178
in the company of men
loyal to Ahmad Kabir,

15:04.283 --> 15:07.078
the warlord who played
footsie with the Taliban.

15:07.183 --> 15:08.682
When they ran, so did he,

15:08.683 --> 15:10.816
except we don't know
exactly where.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.782
We believe Kabir's
men took Sloane

15:12.783 --> 15:15.544
somewhere in the Helmand Valley.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.716
Last year,
Sloane assigned an agent

15:17.717 --> 15:19.782
to infiltrate
Kabir's operation

15:19.783 --> 15:21.315
and intercept information

15:21.316 --> 15:23.873
regarding a shipment
of Soviet missiles.

15:24.016 --> 15:27.004
Sloane stole missiles from
Kabir. Now they're meeting.

15:27.149 --> 15:28.215
What am I missing?

15:28.216 --> 15:30.115
Kabir has no idea who Sloane is.

15:30.116 --> 15:32.549
The agent he assigned
got out undetected.

15:32.550 --> 15:35.015
Who was the agent?

15:35.016 --> 15:37.048
Marcus Dixon.

15:37.049 --> 15:41.504
None of the records we acquired
from SD-6 detailed that mission.

15:41.615 --> 15:44.479
Everything that Jack knows,
now you know.

15:44.582 --> 15:46.715
The only person who can
help us is Dixon.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.443
Who has made it clear
that he has no interest.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.681
You're gonna have to
change his mind.

15:51.682 --> 15:53.748
I want a full briefing on Kabir.

15:53.749 --> 15:56.873
I don't think you appreciate
Dixon's sense of betrayal.

15:57.016 --> 16:00.641
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
yesterday you were standing here

16:00.749 --> 16:03.147
complaining that
we're not doing enough.

16:03.148 --> 16:05.014
If you do nothing
and we lose him,

16:05.015 --> 16:07.515
you'll have only
yourself to blame.

16:13.215 --> 16:15.976
Marcus doesn't want to see you.

16:16.082 --> 16:18.912
And for what it's worth,
neither do I.

16:19.015 --> 16:21.515
I know, Diane.
I do.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.472
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

16:24.582 --> 16:27.082
What good are your promises?

16:27.182 --> 16:29.682
Right.

16:33.315 --> 16:34.480
Hello, Sydney.

16:34.481 --> 16:36.981
Hi.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.415
I need some information.

16:40.915 --> 16:42.914
- I can't help you.
- Five minutes.

16:42.915 --> 16:45.415
- All I need is a location.
- He said no.

16:46.247 --> 16:48.747
It can mean the end of Sloane.

16:50.115 --> 16:52.246
Sloane's with Ahmad Kabir.

16:52.247 --> 16:54.413
I need to know where
Kabir operates.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.313
They need to be stopped.

16:56.314 --> 16:58.080
Not by my husband,
they don't.

16:58.081 --> 17:00.638
The agency might try to
compel you to tell.

17:00.781 --> 17:03.611
If they do, I'll tell them
what I'm telling you.

17:03.715 --> 17:08.204
We've made a decision
as a family to move on.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.079
- Do you own a suit?
- A suit?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.813
Yeah. Uh, one.

17:20.814 --> 17:22.846
- Put it on.
- Why? What's going on?

17:22.847 --> 17:25.180
You've been doing
analysis a short time,

17:25.181 --> 17:26.546
but your briefs are good.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.046
One of them on Ahmad Kabir.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.713
The director wants
a presentation.

17:29.714 --> 17:31.379
Wait, wait.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.913
Like, in person?

17:32.914 --> 17:34.646
- Talking points.
- I'm a writer.

17:34.647 --> 17:36.779
- It's not a request.
- I don't talk.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.813
It's part of your job.

17:38.814 --> 17:40.746
Do you know Sammy's Red Hots?

17:40.747 --> 17:42.746
Sure, yeah.
Santa Monica and 17th.

17:42.747 --> 17:45.304
Be there in one hour.
Order the special. No pickles.

17:45.413 --> 17:47.512
- I like pickles.
- You'll be led out.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.379
A van will be waiting.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.479
I'm gonna be talking
to the director.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.980
- Is that a big deal?
- Yeah.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.580
Oh, God.

18:06.513 --> 18:09.206
It's from the 16th century.

18:10.113 --> 18:12.045
It is a carving of an arhat.

18:12.046 --> 18:13.912
A worthy one.

18:13.913 --> 18:15.412
In Buddhist tradition,

18:15.413 --> 18:18.606
an arhat is the destroyer
of the enemy.

18:18.713 --> 18:21.213
How is it you know so much?

18:21.248 --> 18:23.012
I'm a collector.

18:23.013 --> 18:25.513
This piece is very special.

18:25.546 --> 18:27.511
You want a partner.

18:27.512 --> 18:28.845
Someone to invest in

18:28.846 --> 18:32.334
an incredibly ambitious
global enterprise

18:32.446 --> 18:36.400
which is at best
a risky proposition.

18:36.512 --> 18:41.534
What you offer
in exchange, to be my...

18:41.679 --> 18:44.179
to be my arhat.

18:44.946 --> 18:49.139
I need some assurance that you
can deliver on that promise.

18:49.245 --> 18:51.111
Oh, naturally.

18:51.112 --> 18:54.703
That's why I'm fully prepared
to give you a demonstration.

18:56.079 --> 18:58.806
I leave it to you
to choose the target.

18:58.912 --> 19:00.111
No suit, huh?

19:00.112 --> 19:03.100
It's been a while since
I tried it on. Or worked out.

19:03.212 --> 19:05.712
Which makes me
overwhelmed and fat.

19:05.747 --> 19:07.677
Professors Joyce and Fleming.

19:07.678 --> 19:09.644
They flew in from
the Kennedy school.

19:09.645 --> 19:11.877
I'll go tell the others
we're ready.

19:11.878 --> 19:14.278
The Kennedy school?
Where is that?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.278
Harvard.

19:16.279 --> 19:18.779
That's right.

19:22.511 --> 19:24.677
Our objective today is simple.

19:24.678 --> 19:27.802
To identify persons who can
give us the exact location

19:27.912 --> 19:31.900
of Ahmad Kabir's
Helmand Valley operation.

19:33.078 --> 19:34.911
Despite the
American-backed government,

19:34.912 --> 19:37.434
the geopolitical reality
of Afghanistan

19:37.545 --> 19:39.943
is that it's defined
by ethnic rivalries.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.603
The simplest way to find
a Pashtun like Kabir

19:42.712 --> 19:46.269
is to first find an enemy
willing to sell him out.

19:46.411 --> 19:48.544
Sharif Rabani is on record

19:48.545 --> 19:51.306
as accusing Kabir's
Pashtun supporters

19:51.411 --> 19:53.876
of engaging in ethnic cleansing.

19:53.911 --> 19:56.536
I'm sure we'll get him
to lead us to him.

19:56.644 --> 19:58.843
Then why hasn't he?

19:58.844 --> 20:02.332
Yeah, they hate each other,
but they probably hate us more.

20:02.445 --> 20:06.207
since 9/11, haven't we paid
guys like this millions

20:06.311 --> 20:08.476
and gotten almost
nothing in return?

20:08.477 --> 20:11.806
Are you prepared to make
an alternate recommendation?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.276
Yes, actually, I am.

20:14.277 --> 20:16.543
All I have are
these photographs.

20:16.544 --> 20:19.044
Sydney.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.801
This woman's name
is Alia Gizabi.

20:21.944 --> 20:23.176
She's married
to an administrator

20:23.177 --> 20:25.476
with the Vatican embassy
in Mexico City.

20:25.477 --> 20:27.977
Alia Gizabi used to
be Alia Kabir.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.976
She's Kabir's ex-wife.

20:29.977 --> 20:31.643
since the Taliban got booted,

20:31.644 --> 20:33.576
a woman can have
her marriage annulled

20:33.577 --> 20:36.077
if she was forced
into that marriage,

20:36.143 --> 20:37.810
according to court records.

20:37.811 --> 20:40.402
- You found court records?
- They're on the Net.

20:40.510 --> 20:43.771
There's nothing geopolitically
correct about my analysis.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.706
But I figure this woman would
pay us to mess with her ex.

20:47.810 --> 20:50.537
She hates him so much
that she sent their son

20:50.643 --> 20:53.143
into hiding with her relatives.

20:55.444 --> 20:57.209
I'll get you that Web address.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.575
You should check it out.

20:59.576 --> 21:03.235
Okay, I'll alert our
station chief in Mexico City.

21:03.343 --> 21:05.843
Vaughn and Bristow,
you will leave in one hour.

21:05.943 --> 21:07.775
We need to protect this woman.

21:07.776 --> 21:10.367
No one can know
the CIA's contacted her.

21:10.476 --> 21:12.142
You'll go under an alias.

21:12.143 --> 21:14.608
Kabir has chosen his target.

21:14.609 --> 21:15.809
His ex-wife.

21:15.810 --> 21:18.775
We're using the device
on Alia Gizabi?

21:18.876 --> 21:21.637
You'll be briefed
en route to Mexico City.

21:21.743 --> 21:24.243
You leave at once.

22:01.109 --> 22:03.374
Gizabi's in
the administrative wing

22:03.375 --> 22:05.840
adjacent to the church.

22:05.875 --> 22:08.075
According to
Caplan's calculations

22:08.076 --> 22:09.641
we need 20 million watts

22:09.642 --> 22:11.641
to reach that section
of the building.

22:11.642 --> 22:13.774
20% of its capacity.

22:13.775 --> 22:16.865
That should give us coverage
of the entire embassy.

22:17.775 --> 22:22.298
But, sir. If Caplan's off
by even a microtesla,

22:22.408 --> 22:24.007
this could go very wrong.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.007
Do it.

22:25.008 --> 22:28.496
That's easy for you to say, sir.
You're 8,000 miles away.

22:28.608 --> 22:31.108
I'll wait to hear from you.

22:49.574 --> 22:52.096
I'm approaching the steps.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.708
Senora.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.239
I'm in.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.740
Gizabi works on the first floor.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.740
Can I help you?

23:32.840 --> 23:34.306
I'm not here to hurt you.

23:34.307 --> 23:36.139
I work for
American intelligence.

23:36.140 --> 23:39.299
I need some information
about your ex-husband.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.428
I know you're worried about
retribution for leaving him.

23:42.573 --> 23:45.266
I've come in secret.
No one knows I'm here.

23:45.373 --> 23:47.839
No one will know
you've talked with me.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.772
I'm searching for a man.
A horrible, dangerous man.

23:50.873 --> 23:53.498
He is with your ex-husband
at his residence.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.739
I need to know
exactly where that is.

23:55.740 --> 23:58.331
Vaughn?
Can you hear me? Vaughn?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.872
- What is it?
- We had an Echelon intercept.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.498
Key words. "Terrorist. "
"Weapons of mass destruction. "

24:03.606 --> 24:05.439
You ready for this?
"Rambaldi. "

24:05.440 --> 24:07.605
- Did you get coordinates?
- Yeah. Yours.

24:07.606 --> 24:10.072
We don't know when
it's happening.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.573
Get out now.

24:15.373 --> 24:17.038
I cannot help you.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.805
We have to get out now.

24:18.806 --> 24:20.405
There's gonna be an attack.

24:20.406 --> 24:22.539
Car bomb, suicide bomb.
I don't know.

24:22.540 --> 24:25.233
I'm alerting the embassy.
They're gonna evacuate.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.305
There's a door at the end
of the corridor. Meet me there.

24:28.406 --> 24:30.538
You have to come
for your own safety.

24:30.539 --> 24:33.039
I told you.
I won't help.

25:52.137 --> 25:54.036
- We picked up a hot spot.
- Where?

25:54.037 --> 25:57.161
It's directly behind you.
It's huge.

25:57.304 --> 25:58.537
What? What is it?

25:58.538 --> 25:59.769
Some kind of a fire.

25:59.770 --> 26:00.936
No, listen to me.

26:00.937 --> 26:04.334
It's this inferno,
and it's right behind you.

26:04.471 --> 26:05.669
There's nothing.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.903
Is he seeing people,
buildings, what?

26:07.904 --> 26:09.936
No, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:09.937 --> 26:11.869
It disappeared.
It's gone.

26:11.870 --> 26:12.803
Gone?

26:12.804 --> 26:15.326
I don't know.
It disappeared.

26:17.137 --> 26:19.637
Let's go back.

27:06.536 --> 27:09.558
I'll tell you
where to find my husband.

27:29.302 --> 27:32.324
62 people are dead
in what officials are calling

27:32.469 --> 27:35.559
the worst act of terrorism
in Mexico City in a decade.

27:35.703 --> 27:38.068
Some people describe it
as an act of God.

27:38.069 --> 27:41.967
Local officials are still
investigating the matter.

27:42.069 --> 27:45.091
The victims were
incinerated beyond recognition.

27:45.202 --> 27:47.234
Absent positive identification,

27:47.235 --> 27:49.826
a list of presumed dead
was published.

27:49.935 --> 27:52.435
Your ex is on the list.

28:01.402 --> 28:02.567
What is this?

28:02.568 --> 28:05.227
A small token of appreciation.

28:10.002 --> 28:11.334
No.

28:11.335 --> 28:13.835
No, this is too much.

28:15.601 --> 28:17.300
I cannot accept this.

28:17.301 --> 28:20.926
I saw you admire it.
And deservedly so.

28:21.035 --> 28:23.933
You have destroyed my enemy.

28:24.034 --> 28:27.329
You are in every way my arhat.

28:28.101 --> 28:30.367
I will have $40 million
wired tomorrow

28:30.368 --> 28:32.868
to the account of your choosing.

28:42.134 --> 28:44.167
Surveillance places Sark

28:44.168 --> 28:46.133
at the scene in Mexico City.

28:46.134 --> 28:47.666
Subsequent to the attack,

28:47.667 --> 28:49.900
intel tracked him
as far as Kabul.

28:49.901 --> 28:53.389
We can assume Sloane dispatched
Sark to carry out his mission.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.000
Now that it's complete,
Sark has returned to his master.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.693
Thanks to Miss Gizabi,
we now know where that is.

28:58.801 --> 29:01.596
The plan is for you to lead
a unit into the Helmand.

29:01.701 --> 29:05.599
You'll parachute into
the compound, steal the weapon,

29:05.701 --> 29:08.201
and signal for backup.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.633
You know how people
are describing it.

29:10.634 --> 29:12.800
They're calling it
a Doomsday Device.

29:12.801 --> 29:16.233
Saying it's the first sign
of the coming Armageddon.

29:16.367 --> 29:19.491
Like the Devil himself rose up
to attack that church.

29:19.600 --> 29:23.225
Um, excuse me, if I may offer
a scientific explanation,

29:23.334 --> 29:26.663
I think it might help
the, uh...

29:26.767 --> 29:29.358
Hi, everybody, it's good to...
That's a nice...

29:29.467 --> 29:30.499
Okay.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.733
Right.

29:31.734 --> 29:35.222
What we're dealing with
is a high-energy pulse weapon.

29:35.334 --> 29:36.566
Thanks to an intercept,

29:36.567 --> 29:40.726
we were able to retask
a KH-12 satellite over the area.

29:40.833 --> 29:43.333
This was what we found.

29:43.434 --> 29:45.299
Okay, the blue dots.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.800
Those are the people
in the church before.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.366
This is what the infrared
picked up after.

29:50.367 --> 29:52.732
The body temperature
of everyone

29:52.733 --> 29:54.632
increased by over 2,000 degrees.

29:54.633 --> 29:57.066
They literally melted
from the inside out.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.365
Nothing else
in the church was affected.

29:59.366 --> 30:02.161
That's because it works
like a microwave.

30:02.266 --> 30:04.766
It excites water
and fat molecules,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.298
which don't exist
in inorganic materials.

30:07.299 --> 30:11.287
It converts them
into atomic motion, or heat.

30:11.399 --> 30:14.796
You said everyone was affected.
Even people taking cover?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.598
There's no defense.

30:16.599 --> 30:19.190
It goes through concrete,
steel, everything.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.265
- There's no shield?
- No.

30:21.266 --> 30:23.766
Sorry.

30:24.132 --> 30:26.654
Oh, I should, uh,
probably also tell you

30:26.799 --> 30:29.697
that, um, this energy
knocks out computer circuitry,

30:29.799 --> 30:33.128
which means it could
take down planes.

30:37.498 --> 30:40.554
What concerns me is that
Sloane knows this is

30:40.665 --> 30:43.256
a provocation that
demands a swift response.

30:43.366 --> 30:46.854
Yet he exercised it on the
ex-wife of a petty warlord. Why?

30:46.966 --> 30:48.864
I got the inventory
from the cleaners.

30:48.865 --> 30:51.365
They found audio and video
transmitters.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.564
Video?

30:52.565 --> 30:55.292
Yeah, in the TV in your bedroom.

30:56.066 --> 30:59.088
We're investigating
everyone you've listed.

30:59.231 --> 31:00.965
So far they're all clean.

31:00.966 --> 31:03.030
Hello?

31:03.031 --> 31:04.931
Hey, it's me.
- Hey.

31:04.932 --> 31:07.897
I know we had plans for tonight,
but I have to work.

31:07.998 --> 31:10.555
What you have to do
is quit that job of yours.

31:10.665 --> 31:12.397
- Fran, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

31:12.398 --> 31:15.625
The truth is, I wasn't gonna
be able to make it anyway.

31:15.732 --> 31:18.232
- You don't want to kill me?
- Of course not.

31:18.265 --> 31:21.697
Can we talk about this later?
I'm in the middle of something.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.331
Yeah. I'll call you later.

31:23.332 --> 31:25.832
Bye.

31:33.898 --> 31:37.159
You remember "Predator," when
Schwarzenegger was being chased

31:37.265 --> 31:39.730
by that crab who could
only see in thermal?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.496
- No.
- You never saw that?

31:41.497 --> 31:42.763
It was a great movie.

31:42.764 --> 31:46.786
It was one of his better movies,
because "Twins"...

31:48.297 --> 31:51.127
Anyway, Kabir's security
cameras work the same way.

31:51.230 --> 31:53.730
They read heat.
Which is kind of a problem

31:53.731 --> 31:56.663
'cause, well,
you're incredibly hot.

31:57.798 --> 31:59.663
See?

31:59.664 --> 32:02.096
Now, the solution I have devised

32:02.097 --> 32:05.529
is you parachute onto the roof,
rip off your tactical gear,

32:05.664 --> 32:07.663
then you slip on this baby.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.463
It's part of a cold suit.

32:09.464 --> 32:16.362
It will bring your body
back down to room temperature.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.823
- Put these babies on.
- As long as I'm covered...

32:19.930 --> 32:21.696
the security cameras
can't see me.

32:21.697 --> 32:25.220
You'll be the
Invisible Woman. See?

32:50.663 --> 32:52.796
I'm in the eastern stairs.

32:52.797 --> 32:54.162
Go right at the bottom.

32:54.163 --> 32:56.645
Kabir keeps weapons
and ammunitions

32:56.680 --> 32:59.128
in a room at the end
of the hall.

32:59.129 --> 33:00.295
There's no door.

33:00.296 --> 33:01.729
- What?
- Work's been done.

33:01.730 --> 33:02.928
Maybe this place
was bombed in the war

33:02.929 --> 33:04.562
and had to be reconfigured.

33:04.563 --> 33:06.228
Meaning intel's worthless.

33:06.229 --> 33:08.729
There has to be another way in.

33:23.263 --> 33:25.763
I've been made.

33:33.395 --> 33:35.128
Sydney's been compromised.

33:35.129 --> 33:37.261
Order the tac unit in after her.

33:37.262 --> 33:39.261
Did she defuse the weapon?

33:39.262 --> 33:41.461
If he's got the weapon,
he'll use it.

33:41.462 --> 33:44.859
- Issue the order.
- There's no defense against it.

33:44.995 --> 33:46.927
Tac unit wouldn't
stand a chance.

33:46.928 --> 33:48.294
We can't leave her.

33:48.295 --> 33:52.125
Unless we can find another
way in, that's all we can do.

33:59.395 --> 34:01.594
I don't think
we've been introduced.

34:01.595 --> 34:04.493
My name's Michael Vaughn.
I work with Sydney.

34:06.062 --> 34:07.593
I'm out.

34:07.594 --> 34:09.161
Sydney's in trouble.

34:09.161 --> 34:10.493
Respect my decision.

34:10.494 --> 34:11.328
I can't.

34:11.329 --> 34:14.159
Not when your decision
may cost Sydney her life.

34:14.295 --> 34:17.226
You wouldn't tell Sydney
how you infiltrated Kabir's,

34:17.360 --> 34:19.460
so she found an alternate way in

34:19.460 --> 34:22.222
using what turned out
to be faulty intel.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.527
She was captured.

34:24.527 --> 34:27.027
Unless we find
another access point,

34:27.062 --> 34:29.687
no one will be sent in
to get her out.

34:30.761 --> 34:32.659
- It's not that simple.
- It is.

34:32.661 --> 34:35.559
You will help save
Sydney's life or you won't.

34:41.027 --> 34:43.527
Please leave.

34:44.594 --> 34:46.560
I can't do that.

34:46.561 --> 34:49.186
Not until I get your answer.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.360
Admit you are CIA.

34:59.394 --> 35:02.189
Submit to a videotape
acknowledging you are here

35:02.294 --> 35:05.487
in violation
of international law.

35:09.994 --> 35:11.826
Condemn the Great Satan,

35:11.827 --> 35:15.623
and maybe I will
spare your life.

35:27.694 --> 35:31.819
Sydney, tell him
what he wants to hear...

35:36.593 --> 35:39.093
...or this will not end well.

35:42.593 --> 35:45.525
You know, in many ways...

35:46.327 --> 35:49.884
...I will always consider you
my proudest accomplishment.

35:50.493 --> 35:52.993
Please, Sydney.

35:54.193 --> 35:57.454
Unfortunately, I can't
do anything about this.

36:02.659 --> 36:05.159
Bye, Sydney.

36:11.459 --> 36:13.959
Have you reconsidered?

36:16.726 --> 36:18.959
Admitting you are CIA?

36:18.960 --> 36:22.016
Perhaps you need
a little incentive.

36:38.392 --> 36:40.425
Enough.

36:40.426 --> 36:41.958
My houseguests have left.

36:41.959 --> 36:44.618
It would seem there's
nothing more to discuss.

36:44.725 --> 36:48.054
The cartilage that lets
the kneecap slide around

36:48.159 --> 36:49.524
does not regenerate,

36:49.525 --> 36:52.218
which you should know
in advance of this.

37:13.058 --> 37:15.558
You okay?

37:17.124 --> 37:18.923
I don't understand.

37:18.924 --> 37:21.424
How did you find a way in?

37:24.358 --> 37:26.858
Let's go.

37:28.591 --> 37:31.091
Let's go.
We got the device.

37:36.058 --> 37:37.524
- Sloane?
- No.

37:37.525 --> 37:40.025
This way.

39:04.556 --> 39:07.056
Good work.

39:07.489 --> 39:09.021
I was lucky.

39:09.022 --> 39:10.288
You got the weapon.

39:10.289 --> 39:12.088
You've saved countless lives.

39:12.089 --> 39:13.422
Yeah.

39:13.423 --> 39:15.388
I didn't get Sloane.

39:15.389 --> 39:18.411
Or figure out what the hell
he's doing with Kabir.

39:19.655 --> 39:22.711
We found these on the plumber
you gave us. He was murdered.

39:22.822 --> 39:26.015
He's either responsible for
the bugs or he was set up.

39:26.122 --> 39:28.622
At the moment, it's a dead end.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.122
I'm glad you're home.

39:37.422 --> 39:40.683
# Take your eyes off me #

39:40.789 --> 39:44.346
# There's nothing here to see #

39:45.388 --> 39:50.047
# Trying to keep
my head together #

39:53.422 --> 39:55.087
# As we make our vow #

39:55.088 --> 39:57.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:57.155 --> 40:00.587
# Let us remember how #

40:00.689 --> 40:04.416
# There's nothing good
that lasts forever #

40:04.522 --> 40:07.022
I know I say this to you a lot.

40:07.821 --> 40:10.321
Thank you.

40:14.522 --> 40:18.113
I can't judge you for not
telling me about SD-6.

40:19.754 --> 40:21.553
If I had been in your position,

40:21.554 --> 40:24.315
I can't say I wouldn't
have done the same.

40:25.454 --> 40:28.045
# Time out
on the running boards #

40:28.155 --> 40:34.519
# We're running through a world
that lost its meaning #

40:34.621 --> 40:37.121
What's going on with Diane?

40:41.088 --> 40:43.588
I don't know.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.985
# Feel the touch of grief #

40:53.120 --> 40:57.609
# You stand in disbelief #

40:57.754 --> 41:02.550
# Can steal the Earth
from right beneath you #

41:05.687 --> 41:09.414
# And falling in so far #

41:09.521 --> 41:13.748
# They know
just where you are #

41:13.853 --> 41:18.841
# Yeah, but there ain't
no way to reach you #

41:20.987 --> 41:23.544
Kings are in town
on Friday night.

41:26.253 --> 41:28.753
You could watch the Zamboni.

41:33.987 --> 41:36.612
# Trying to find
a way to love #

41:36.720 --> 41:41.118
# This running
ain't no kind of freedom #

41:41.219 --> 41:43.719
What we saw.

41:45.953 --> 41:48.453
At the church.

41:49.119 --> 41:52.243
Every time we think
we've seen the worst...

42:12.719 --> 42:16.048
You talk of power and control.

42:17.852 --> 42:20.218
But when we create
a powerful weapon,

42:20.219 --> 42:23.309
you leave it in the hands
of a complete stranger.

42:23.419 --> 42:26.180
Tell me, how was what
happened good for us?

42:32.986 --> 42:35.781
Hand me the top page
of the manuscript.
