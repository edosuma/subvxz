00:11.291 --> 00:13.291
[camera shutter clicks, whirring]

00:19.208 --> 00:20.583
[camera shutter clicking]

00:23.791 --> 00:26.625
You found it like this?
Didn't touch anything, did you?

00:27.416 --> 00:30.375
No, sir. Clocked in, did my morning rounds
and there it was.

00:31.375 --> 00:36.125
You know, I read a story once about a guy
who diddled dead bodies. Necropeelio?

00:36.125 --> 00:37.208
Necrophiliac.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.958
[camera whirring]

00:39.958 --> 00:41.125
[guard] Right.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.000
I'd never heard of taking the body
with them when they're done.

00:44.541 --> 00:46.041
So what do you think? Robbers?

00:46.750 --> 00:48.500
Take the jewelry, not the body.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.083
Oh, no, you don't!
Told you if I saw you again--

00:52.083 --> 00:53.166
[Auguste] I'm leaving.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.750
Don't make me confiscate that camera.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.958
You can't,
unless I'm being charged with a crime.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.291
Don't push me, Mr. Dupin.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.291
I told you,
this is serious business.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.166
And you're not supposed to be here!

01:03.166 --> 01:05.500
[man] <i>I've got to tell
the police captain again</i>

01:05.500 --> 01:08.625
why one of my guys is impersonating
a fucking police officer.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.458
Not my fault the guard made assumptions.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.333
- Must be the coat.
- You think you're funny?

01:12.333 --> 01:15.083
I get a call from a lady a few weeks ago
whose mom passed away.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.375
And she found some paperwork saying
the old lady was seeing some doctor.

01:18.375 --> 01:22.000
Her daughter never met this doctor.
No idea her mom was seeing him at all.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.041
And apparently, he signed her up
for a drug trial.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.791
But mom wasn't competent.

01:26.791 --> 01:30.125
Daughter notices mom's signature
on the consent form was forged.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.416
I call the number,
it's an answering service.

01:32.416 --> 01:34.458
I call the doctor, he hangs up on me.

01:34.458 --> 01:37.666
Turns out there are multiple complaints
about this drug trial.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.333
So Ms. Brady calls me
this morning in a panic.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.375
She got a call from the cemetery.
Her mother's grave was disturbed.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.541
- See here's where you fucked up.
- So I went down--

01:45.541 --> 01:47.958
- You're an idiot.
- Because there have been five!

01:48.458 --> 01:50.875
Five graves exhumed
in the last four weeks.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.000
Five corpses missing!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.416
All people who were part
of that drug trial.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.750
Bodies vanished into thin air.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.541
I don't like you. I've had issues
with you people in the past.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.458
You people?

02:01.458 --> 02:03.458
Whole damn office still white
as cream cheese,

02:03.458 --> 02:05.250
in case you're worried we're invading.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.041
Who says I'm talking about your skin?
That's right, I noticed that too.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.208
You need two things to do this job,
a phone and a typewriter.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.291
And some respect. Three things, I guess.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.958
Respect? Come on, nobody holds anybody
to account, you know that.

02:17.958 --> 02:21.458
The people in charge
of making us healthy make us sick.

02:21.458 --> 02:25.333
We cheat the dying. We fleece the poor.

02:25.333 --> 02:28.833
Promote the racist.
Let the demons run amok.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.125
This world needs changing.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.250
Okay, then.

02:33.958 --> 02:34.958
Say you win.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.000
If you could catch them all,
take all of it,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.708
all the greed, the foulness,
the rot in the world

02:40.708 --> 02:43.708
and sit down across from it,
what would you say?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.291
[Auguste] <i>Was it ever going to be enough?</i>

02:48.708 --> 02:49.708
Over the years,

02:51.083 --> 02:53.916
I've talked to a lot of people
who have taken your drugs.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.125
Soccer moms with headaches.

02:58.208 --> 03:02.166
Accountants with carpal tunnel.
Kids with sports injuries.

03:02.166 --> 03:06.291
Their docs prescribe them Ligodone,
pitch it like extra strength Tylenol.

03:06.291 --> 03:10.166
Fast forward a year, they're shooting up
heroin behind dumpsters.

03:10.958 --> 03:11.958
Or they're dead.

03:11.958 --> 03:16.625
Don't be naive. I'm not responsible
if people abuse Ligodone.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.916
This is an old and boring argument.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.666
Do you know how much Ligodone
my wife takes every day?

03:21.666 --> 03:22.750
She's fine.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.791
Wasn't your wife a heroin addict
before you met?

03:24.791 --> 03:27.625
She is a success story
from every angle, I agree.

03:27.625 --> 03:31.000
You knew the extended release formulation
created abuse potential.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.583
You knew it was highly addictive.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.708
You marketed it non-addictive anyway

03:35.708 --> 03:40.291
because you wanted more than
the hundreds of millions you were pulling

03:40.291 --> 03:41.958
before Ligodone hit the market.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.958
That wasn't enough for you,
so that's my question.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.833
Was it ever going to be enough?

03:49.125 --> 03:53.750
How much money would make
you say, "We did it"?

03:53.750 --> 03:55.250
Does that number even exist?

03:55.250 --> 03:57.250
That's an idiot question. Course not.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.291
But we aren't here to talk about that.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.541
We're here to talk about...

04:06.208 --> 04:07.833
- What?
- [thunder rumbling]

04:13.041 --> 04:14.041
My son.

04:17.708 --> 04:18.708
Prospero.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.375
Perry.

04:22.708 --> 04:27.541
So, Frederick told me before the end,
he thought Perry was your informant.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.875
That he was giving you the information.

04:29.875 --> 04:30.958
Was he?

04:31.708 --> 04:33.750
Because it really doesn't matter now.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.500
Anyway, it doesn't matter at all.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.625
Not since I killed him.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.083
I know how Prospero died.

04:45.541 --> 04:50.875
Are you saying
that was somehow your fault?

04:50.875 --> 04:54.041
Perry was the first of my children to die.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.750
And I know you think
you know how that happened.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.458
But you don't.

05:00.916 --> 05:04.250
The first thing you have to understand
about my son is that he was,

05:04.250 --> 05:05.500
if nothing else...

05:08.166 --> 05:09.333
crazy.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.041
Fuck.

05:37.833 --> 05:38.833
Morning.

05:39.791 --> 05:41.541
We haven't slept yet.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.541
[both chuckle]

05:42.541 --> 05:44.166
You've got to try this stuff.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.333
Where are my eggs?
Did you eat my eggs?

05:46.333 --> 05:48.291
Do you care? They're fucking eggs.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.208
They were gull's eggs.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.000
Black-headed gull's eggs.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.125
Foraged from Keyhaven Marshes.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.083
They're only in season
for three weeks a year.

06:00.083 --> 06:04.250
If I push this in, you can't take it out.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.416
You have to leave it in
on the way to the hospital,

06:06.416 --> 06:07.958
or else it'll just get worse.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.250
Babe, no one touched your eggs.

06:13.875 --> 06:14.916
[fork clatters]

06:14.916 --> 06:16.458
[chuckles, sighs]

06:16.458 --> 06:18.666
Jesus. You had me going there.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.583
[Prospero] Oh! Huh.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.833
Here they are. I found them.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.500
You know, I'm still pissed
your dad didn't go for the club idea.

06:29.791 --> 06:31.500
Your dad wouldn't know a good idea

06:31.500 --> 06:34.708
if it smeared his dick in peanut butter
and sucked it off.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.625
[Faraj chuckles]

06:35.625 --> 06:37.416
Yeah, should have thought of that.

06:37.916 --> 06:40.333
No, I just opened up
a bottle of the Glenfiddich.

06:40.333 --> 06:44.375
Plus, you never fuck family.
Apparently, you just hunt them.

06:45.625 --> 06:49.291
I don't know. Maybe this is a good thing.
My dad does this fucking thing.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.458
Every kid in the family gets
their nest egg investment

06:52.458 --> 06:53.833
once paternity is established.

06:53.833 --> 06:57.916
Every one of my fucking siblings got it.
It's like a given. Like a fucking right.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.958
But you have to pitch him on it.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.291
And he grinds you.

07:02.875 --> 07:04.333
And once he finally approves...

07:04.916 --> 07:07.083
you should see
what it fucking does to them.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.875
He makes it sound like a gift,
but it's not. It's a trick.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.291
He puts you
under his ugly ass fucking thumb,

07:12.291 --> 07:13.916
and you might never get out.

07:13.916 --> 07:15.291
So fuck him.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.583
He doesn't like my idea?

07:17.500 --> 07:18.791
Maybe we dodged a bullet.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.125
[cell phone vibrates]

07:21.541 --> 07:22.875
Hmm. Who's Dickwad?

07:23.375 --> 07:25.458
- It's my brother, Frederick.
- [Faraj] Oh.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.250
Fuck.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.125
Bye.

07:33.125 --> 07:38.333
We at Fortunato take our responsibility
to the environment very seriously,

07:38.333 --> 07:41.958
and we are aligned with you
in our mutual goal of compliance

07:41.958 --> 07:44.541
with any and all regulatory guidelines.

07:44.541 --> 07:46.083
Okay, that's not true.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.875
And you didn't return my calls
until your company was indicted.

07:48.875 --> 07:52.291
Sorry I'm late. I got hit by a truck.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.333
[chuckles softly]

07:53.333 --> 07:56.083
Sorry, everyone.
This is my brother, Prospero.

07:56.750 --> 07:57.875
What's this?

07:57.875 --> 08:01.708
This is a collection
of condemned Fortunato testing facilities

08:01.708 --> 08:06.291
that are not compliant or, worse,
leaking toxins into the groundwater.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.958
Holy shit, we own all of these?

08:08.708 --> 08:10.250
Are you acknowledging ownership?

08:10.250 --> 08:11.375
Of course he isn't.

08:11.375 --> 08:14.375
- What's the problem with these?
- [woman] Well, we inspected these sites--

08:14.375 --> 08:16.041
By court order or permission?

08:16.041 --> 08:18.125
If you don't own them, what do you care?

08:18.125 --> 08:20.041
We found evidence of buried toxins.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.250
Oil, coal, pesticides,
rotting debris, chemicals,

08:23.250 --> 08:26.791
heavy metals, including arsenic, benzene,
chromium, mercury and lead.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.458
One site had such a highly acidic
concentration that--

08:30.458 --> 08:33.958
- Sorry, yes. [clears throat] That's bad.
- [Peter] You're acknowledging?

08:33.958 --> 08:36.166
He is not, and you know that, Peter.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.666
[Frederick] Any structure
we own or control,

08:38.666 --> 08:40.458
if it's found in violation,

08:40.458 --> 08:43.333
and we are legally liable
for that property,

08:43.333 --> 08:44.583
we'll bring to code,

08:44.583 --> 08:47.041
or we will demolish it
as soon as possible.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.708
[woman] You've been saying that
for a year. Over a year.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.875
With due respect,
we keep having the same meeting.

08:51.875 --> 08:56.583
Don't tear them down just yet, actually.
Some of these are a fucking goldmine.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.125
If this one is ours, I want to see it.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.833
It's perfect for this idea I had

09:00.833 --> 09:04.125
- for this anonymous debauchery--
- Can I talk to you for a moment?

09:04.125 --> 09:05.708
- Excuse us, please.
- Do you want--

09:05.708 --> 09:07.291
- Let's go.
- You could be invited.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.250
- [grunts]
- The fuck are you doing?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.666
I'm getting to know the family business,
like Dad said.

09:11.666 --> 09:13.208
You're supposed to be shadowing me.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.250
Shadows don't fucking talk.
They don't speak.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.916
And they don't fucking acknowledge
the allegations.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.291
Everything okay?

09:20.333 --> 09:21.958
He talks. You don't talk.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.875
If you're ever in doubt, you say,

09:23.875 --> 09:29.291
"We at Fortunato take our responsibility
to the environment very seriously.

09:29.291 --> 09:33.375
[both] "And we are aligned with you
in our mutual goal of compliance

09:33.375 --> 09:36.250
with any and all
of the regulatory guidelines."

09:36.250 --> 09:38.500
Do you know
how many attorneys they brought?

09:39.041 --> 09:40.125
- Seven.
- [Arthur] Six.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.541
Okay, they brought six.
Do you know how many we brought?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.208
One!

09:45.208 --> 09:49.083
Because Arthur has the power of six,
or seven, attorneys.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.041
And the last thing he fucking needs

09:51.041 --> 09:54.208
is Gucci Caligula handing over
the keys to the store.

09:54.208 --> 09:58.791
Yeah, but weren't you supposed to demolish
those buildings six or seven months ago?

09:58.791 --> 10:01.000
I know it's you, you little fuck.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.416
No wonder you're so comfy
talking around the Feds.

10:03.416 --> 10:05.125
Getting a lot of practice after hours?

10:05.125 --> 10:07.916
I know you're the fucking mole. I know it.

10:07.916 --> 10:09.291
And when I can prove it,

10:09.291 --> 10:12.000
I'm going to serve you up to Dad
on a silver platter.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
You don't discuss that
in the building, Frederick.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.916
I'm not the...

10:15.916 --> 10:18.666
You know, I don't think mole
is the right word for it,

10:18.666 --> 10:21.041
but I'm not the informant. Or whatever.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.875
I'm only here because Dad said so--

10:22.875 --> 10:26.166
You're only here because my father fucked
a blackjack dealer

10:26.166 --> 10:28.750
on a yacht in Cannes 25 years ago.

10:28.750 --> 10:32.000
And he fucked her so hard
that the estate cracked

10:32.000 --> 10:34.041
into six pieces instead of five.

10:34.541 --> 10:35.958
Fucking bastard.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.125
[Prospero] <i>We're throwing a party.</i>

10:45.125 --> 10:46.291
Here.

10:46.875 --> 10:47.875
Tomorrow night.

10:47.875 --> 10:50.416
No holds barred. Fuck the permits.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.500
Anonymous debauchery social event

10:52.500 --> 10:54.416
that changes venues every month.

10:54.416 --> 10:57.125
You won't know where it is
unless you're on the list.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.250
And the list is fucking exclusive.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.833
- [Jenny] It's a pop-up club.
- [Prospero] The pop-up club.

11:01.833 --> 11:02.916
You get a digital invite.

11:02.916 --> 11:05.458
Don't click the link
in five minutes, it disappears.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.708
And to get on the list, you pay
a serious fucking membership fee.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.458
- [Faraj] How much?
- [Prospero] Ten grand.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.541
So we get 100 people on the list,
that's our first million.

11:13.541 --> 11:17.000
Five grand at the door
per party you attend, we're at 1.5.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.625
Never at the same place twice.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.666
This building belongs
to my family's company.

11:21.666 --> 11:25.416
These old labs have their own power,
closed water supply.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.083
Keeps us off the city's radar.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.791
And it's slated for demolition,
so it's fucking free.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.958
Do we need a theme or something?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.291
No. It's not a fucking prom.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.708
Sex and drugs are the theme.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.916
The orgy starts at midnight.

11:41.541 --> 11:44.458
- Actually make that 20 grand.
- [Jenny] But baby, 20 grand--

11:44.458 --> 11:46.625
[Prospero] And it should be a masquerade.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.166
[Jenny] I guess we could make that, right?

11:52.708 --> 11:54.583
[indistinct conversation]

12:03.083 --> 12:04.583
[Jenny and Faraj chuckling]

12:08.375 --> 12:09.541
[ECG beeping]

12:14.083 --> 12:15.875
What? No, she can still make it.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.583
- Pulse ox is--
- Tanking. It was a long shot.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.750
- Give more nitrates.
- No, they won't help.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.333
Not at this point. It's just not taking.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.375
Okay, give her more adrenaline.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.583
What? No!

12:26.583 --> 12:28.000
Hey, Vic!

12:28.000 --> 12:32.041
Hey! Victorine, listen to me, don't just...

12:33.125 --> 12:34.375
[Alessandra sighs]

12:35.791 --> 12:38.000
[beeping continues]

12:42.083 --> 12:43.708
[beeping slows down]

12:44.958 --> 12:46.958
[ECG flatlining]

12:49.541 --> 12:50.625
[Alessandra] Mark it.

12:51.041 --> 12:51.875
Fuck!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.750
[bangs on table]

12:56.208 --> 12:57.458
It's okay. It really is.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.666
No, babe, nothing about this is okay.

12:59.666 --> 13:02.125
At this rate,
we'll lose funding in six months.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.416
If she'd lived,
the whole trial would be poisoned.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.250
[sighs] Because of the adrenaline.

13:10.333 --> 13:14.958
The last thing we should be talking
about right now is human trials.

13:14.958 --> 13:17.666
[Roderick] <i>Human trials.
How much longer is this gonna take?</i>

13:17.666 --> 13:19.791
- The monkey's fine, right?
- Yeah, it's...

13:20.916 --> 13:23.208
Our test subjects are reacting
as predicted.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.958
I'm going over the latest reports,
I'll bring them over later.

13:25.958 --> 13:27.791
I need this viable in humans.

13:28.666 --> 13:30.041
And a lot sooner.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.583
- Like six months.
- What?

13:33.458 --> 13:34.541
No, that's...

13:35.916 --> 13:37.000
Okay, why?

13:37.750 --> 13:38.958
You just asked me why?

13:38.958 --> 13:41.625
You let me worry about why
and you worry about results.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.666
If we're not going to make those dates...

13:44.625 --> 13:46.666
if we're going to miss
the human trial threshold,

13:46.666 --> 13:50.083
if my 200 million is coming up snake eyes,
you'll tell me, right?

13:50.083 --> 13:52.250
- Well, yeah, of course.
- Look at me.

13:52.916 --> 13:53.916
I need this to work.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.458
[Prospero] <i>Come on, man,
I don't ask for much.</i>

13:58.458 --> 14:01.500
You want a little Molly, a little coke,
a little pick me up,

14:01.500 --> 14:03.375
or a check me out, I'm your guy.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.708
But I'm not a fucking cartel,
I can't supply your whole rave.

14:06.708 --> 14:08.625
You know people
who move that kind of weight?

14:08.625 --> 14:10.375
"Move that kind of weight"?

14:10.375 --> 14:12.916
What? Have you been watching
fucking <i>Narcos</i> or something?

14:12.916 --> 14:14.750
You should if you haven't. It's brilliant.

14:14.750 --> 14:15.750
What about Viagra?

14:15.750 --> 14:18.666
- Mmm. Yeah, I've got a stash out back.
- You do?

14:18.666 --> 14:21.250
No, I don't. Because I'm a stallion
in my fucking prime.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.958
And why the fuck do you need Viagra?

14:23.958 --> 14:25.250
You're in your twenties.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.083
You're basically 80% cum,
I can fucking smell it on you.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
I just want this thing to be epic.

14:30.458 --> 14:33.125
Dad doesn't believe in me
and the rest make fun of me,

14:33.125 --> 14:36.666
but I blow the roof off this thing
and I print seven figures out of thin air,

14:36.666 --> 14:40.250
maybe I get a fraction of the respect
that's supposed to come with this name?

14:40.250 --> 14:43.458
It's harder for me.
You know that. But the rest don't.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.791
It's hard enough for the bastards,
but it's harder for me for some reason.

14:46.791 --> 14:50.000
Like I'm extra bastard.
Like I'm the fucking bastard's bastard.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.833
All right, okay, I get it. Look.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.000
You're going to pull this off, all right?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.541
You've got this.
Half your guests will be holding,

14:56.541 --> 14:59.000
half will be rolling
before they even get there.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.541
I'll give you two dealers to invite.

15:00.541 --> 15:02.958
And they'll jump on it,
just for the sales opportunity.

15:02.958 --> 15:06.166
But whatever the fuck goes down after that
is on them, not you.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.458
Oi! Look at me.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.583
This shouldn't be on you.

15:13.958 --> 15:15.375
You're better than a dealer.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.333
You're smarter than a DJ.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.875
All right? This is beneath you.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.375
And you're going to kill it.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.875
But you're better than all of this.

15:25.041 --> 15:30.166
And the minute you figure that out, bruv,
you're going to be unstoppable.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.000
All right.

15:37.916 --> 15:38.916
Just for you.

15:38.916 --> 15:41.583
Because I get the kind
of performance anxiety

15:41.583 --> 15:43.333
that comes with a public orgy,

15:43.333 --> 15:46.166
- I'm going to get you some Viagra.
- You do have Viagra?

15:46.166 --> 15:47.500
Of course I have Viagra.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.875
I have a reputation to uphold.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.541
[man on TV] <i>Yeah!</i>

15:51.541 --> 15:52.750
<i>That's it!</i>

15:53.291 --> 15:56.125
<i>That's right. Feel that.</i>

15:56.875 --> 15:58.208
<i>You can do it.</i>

15:59.125 --> 16:01.500
<i>We're going to go another 60 seconds.</i>

16:01.500 --> 16:04.041
<i>- Feel that? You bet you do.
- </i>  [women] <i>Yeah.</i>

16:04.791 --> 16:06.208
<i>You are getting BILLT.</i>

16:06.208 --> 16:08.791
<i>As a drug rep, you were encouraged</i>

16:08.791 --> 16:12.541
<i>to report this kind of issue
to your supervisors at Fortunato?</i>

16:13.250 --> 16:16.125
<i>Uh, I was not. I was discouraged even.</i>

16:16.666 --> 16:18.166
[Auguste] <i>But you reported it anyway?</i>

16:18.166 --> 16:23.333
<i>I was concerned that this particular
doctor was running a pill mill.</i>

16:23.333 --> 16:26.500
[Auguste] <i>To the best of your knowledge,
was any action taken?</i>

16:26.500 --> 16:29.208
<i>To the best of my knowledge, no.
No action was taken.</i>

16:29.208 --> 16:31.375
[Camille] Look into this witness soon.
Drug rep.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.000
See if you can find something.

16:33.666 --> 16:37.708
And if you can't find something,
we may have to just find something.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.375
How was your day?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.958
We're looking everywhere, but...

16:42.958 --> 16:44.541
Toby, damn it.

16:44.541 --> 16:48.000
I'm sorry. If somebody talked to the Feds,
they were smart about it.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.416
[Camille] I know.
The Ushers aren't idiots.

16:50.916 --> 16:51.875
Except Perry.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.416
Get me Vic's file. And Juno's.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.958
[Tina] Wow, nobody's in court today?

17:01.583 --> 17:04.875
I knew your dad was skipping,
but nobody from your family...

17:04.875 --> 17:07.125
[Camille] No.
We won't show up again most likely.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.625
We sit there, they get credibility.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.916
But we will be watching every second.
You'd better believe it.

17:12.916 --> 17:15.375
You're still thinking
Victorine's the informant?

17:15.375 --> 17:16.291
[Camille] Maybe.

17:16.291 --> 17:18.708
It could be Perry. Little psycho.

17:18.708 --> 17:19.916
I also want to look at Juno,

17:19.916 --> 17:22.750
but something stinks
about Vic's clinical trial.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.500
That might be the Feds' way in.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.208
If they have something
on her heart mesh,

17:26.208 --> 17:27.541
can you poke at that?

17:27.541 --> 17:30.250
Talk to lab techs, bribe,
threaten, mix and match.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.500
[sighs] What did she do to you?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.000
I'm sorry, what was that?

17:35.333 --> 17:36.333
Um...

17:38.375 --> 17:39.208
Nothing.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.583
I mean, I hate my sister too, but...

17:44.958 --> 17:46.791
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.875
I will.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.041
You know what? I will need both of you
tonight before dinner.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.916
[Faraj] You tap on the mask
and it takes you to the payment page.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.041
We'll get Apple Pay up
before tomorrow night.

18:07.041 --> 18:10.000
- Working on your guest list too.
- Right. Good job, Faraj.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.375
Okay. I'm thinking we get everybody
on the dance floor,

18:14.916 --> 18:16.541
install some padding up in here,

18:16.541 --> 18:19.041
and turn on those sprinklers,
make it rain.

18:19.041 --> 18:20.583
Kicks off the fuckfest.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.750
Nobody sucks or fucks
until the rain starts.

18:23.750 --> 18:24.750
Yes?

18:24.750 --> 18:28.541
<i>♪ Well, I said certified freak
Seven days a week ♪</i>

18:28.541 --> 18:31.750
<i>♪ Wet-ass party
Make that pull-out game weak ♪</i>

18:31.750 --> 18:33.750
[Prospero] Is that what the song is now?

18:33.750 --> 18:34.833
- Yeah?
- [Jenny] Yeah.

18:35.958 --> 18:37.541
[Prospero] Yo. How's the water?

18:37.541 --> 18:40.833
[man] Well, tap's off.
The municipal line's closed off.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.416
I'd suggest serving
bottled water back here.

18:43.416 --> 18:45.375
Everybody's drinking Dom anyway.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.791
What about the sprinklers?

18:46.791 --> 18:49.666
- Those are dry.
- Bullshit, they're dripping on my phone.

18:49.666 --> 18:52.958
They might sweat a little,
they're old, but there's no pressure.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.791
I can call the city, see if we can tie
into the municipal line.

18:57.791 --> 19:00.291
Ugh. Dry-ass party.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.500
Yeah, works less well.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.416
You know, these testing facilities
need their own filtered water.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.625
And Fortunato wouldn't use city water.
Not in a million years.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.166
You guys saw those tanks on the roof
when we walked in, yes?

19:17.166 --> 19:18.750
- [Jenny] Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.875
Okay, cool. We just tie in.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.708
Like hooking up a hot tub.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.208
[Jenny] You can do that by tomorrow night?

19:25.208 --> 19:26.166
Yes.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.333
Because remember the golden rule.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.208
Whoever has the gold makes the--

19:35.875 --> 19:36.791
What was that?

19:37.750 --> 19:40.000
Uh, sorry, it's an old joke.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.166
Old joke I told them once.

19:43.666 --> 19:44.916
"Remember the golden rule."

19:47.791 --> 19:49.000
It was in a comic book.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.041
<i>The Wizard of Id.</i>

19:53.875 --> 19:56.458
Number four... I think.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.916
Late '60s, kitschy as hell.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.541
And the cover was a stout little king
standing on a green tower

20:03.541 --> 20:06.958
looking down over his subjects,
one finger up,

20:07.916 --> 20:11.958
making a proclamation,
"Remember the golden rule."

20:13.458 --> 20:14.583
"And what's that?"

20:14.583 --> 20:18.375
his short little peasant subjects
shout back from below.

20:20.083 --> 20:25.166
And then... this little peasant in the back,
he pipes up.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.333
And in the last little word bubble
it says,

20:31.083 --> 20:33.083
"Whoever has the gold makes the--"

20:33.083 --> 20:34.916
[thunder rumbling]

20:45.166 --> 20:46.791
Are you... Are you all right?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.708
[chuckles]

20:52.708 --> 20:54.458
Have you ever heard of CADASIL?

20:54.458 --> 20:55.541
No.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.625
Is that another drug,
something else in Fortunato's arsenal?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.125
How many people will this one kill?

21:01.125 --> 21:03.625
You were a Medicare fraud investigator
once upon a time.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.833
You were in the industry.
You should know this, CADASIL.

21:08.541 --> 21:12.541
Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy

21:13.291 --> 21:15.750
with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.333
CADASIL.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.708
In fairness to you,
it wasn't coined until '93.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.291
Anyway.

21:22.875 --> 21:26.708
It's a hereditary form
of vascular cognitive impairment.

21:27.958 --> 21:31.125
Before it kills you, it causes symptoms
very much like dementia.

21:32.916 --> 21:36.875
Affects thinking,
problem solving, spatial...

21:38.750 --> 21:41.291
reasoning and memory.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.583
It can even cause hallucinations.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.708
You're talking about vascular dementia?

21:50.250 --> 21:51.583
There's no cure, you know.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
And a five-year prognosis, on the outside.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.375
The medications, anti-psychotics,

22:00.375 --> 22:03.000
the beta-blockers, the stimulants...
No, thank you.

22:04.916 --> 22:06.041
Don't kid a kidder.

22:10.875 --> 22:14.541
So really, the only hope is preventative.

22:15.833 --> 22:20.625
Like, say, an experimental
new smart heart mesh

22:20.625 --> 22:24.166
that offers real-time diagnostics
of major blood vessels in the brain.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.500
Might buy some time.

22:29.791 --> 22:31.291
<i>The Wizard of Id.</i>

22:33.708 --> 22:36.166
A play on <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> A comic.

22:37.291 --> 22:41.916
About a sprawling cast of characters
in a medieval kingdom called Id.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.083
More of a <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> guy.

22:46.708 --> 22:50.250
And I first saw it hanging outside
Rufus Griswold's office.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.958
You remember Gris, don't you?

22:54.958 --> 22:58.791
That unfortunate cemetery business...

23:00.708 --> 23:02.458
was your whole thing, wasn't it?

23:02.458 --> 23:04.750
I remember everything, Roderick.

23:06.208 --> 23:09.000
Gris, the original gangsta, you might say.

23:10.791 --> 23:14.125
All of this really starts there.

23:16.708 --> 23:20.375
In that office with Rufus Griswold.

23:22.916 --> 23:24.500
The original cocksucker.

23:25.625 --> 23:27.208
[phone ringing]

23:27.833 --> 23:30.375
[Rufus] Tell him
no more fucking messes.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.583
And no more cops.
He has one job, for Christ's sake.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.833
He's a glorified fucking gardener.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.416
I just need him to dig!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.500
Mr. Griswold is ready for you.

23:41.666 --> 23:42.500
Roderick Usher.

23:43.708 --> 23:44.875
Oh, yeah, right.

23:48.375 --> 23:49.458
Sorry about that.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.666
You want a drink, Rod?

23:50.666 --> 23:51.958
Uh, no, I'm fine.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.041
[clears throat]

23:54.125 --> 23:55.458
Fucking FDA.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.375
Fuck Dicks Association.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.083
Between Carter and the Fuck Dicks,
am I right?

24:00.083 --> 24:03.416
Yeah, absolutely. Stupid Fuck Dicks.

24:04.958 --> 24:07.583
Sorry, this is your time.
Third quarter projections.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.666
No, sorry, I'm Roderick Usher,
I have a presentation.

24:13.791 --> 24:15.500
When was the last time you had a headache?

24:15.500 --> 24:17.583
Fuck me. This is a pitch?

24:18.416 --> 24:22.083
Suz, you said it was fucking accounting!
This is not Suz's day.

24:22.083 --> 24:25.541
Sorry, this has been on the books
a few times. Do you want me to reschedule?

24:26.291 --> 24:27.333
[sighs]

24:27.333 --> 24:28.458
No.

24:28.458 --> 24:30.125
Fuck it, you're here already. Go ahead.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.000
When was the last time you had a headache?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.208
- Yesterday? This morning?
- I've got one right now.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.750
Arthritis. Back pain.
What do you take for it? Ibuprofen?

24:38.291 --> 24:44.000
Serious pain, you're on opioids.
Everyday pain, you're on acetaminophen.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.041
But for the gulf in between?
Well, you're fucked.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.166
So, let me introduce you to Ligodone.

24:54.916 --> 24:58.500
A reformulated opioid coated
in a proprietary synthetic

24:58.500 --> 24:59.750
to slow absorption.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.666
No side effects. Non-addictive.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.250
A serious injury, cancer, trauma, sure,

25:05.250 --> 25:09.125
but also for chronic, mild,
even temporary pain.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.291
Same pill.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.708
Only thing that changes is the dose.

25:12.708 --> 25:16.541
This whole industry has always
been about pain management.

25:16.541 --> 25:18.875
This is about pain erasure.

25:18.875 --> 25:23.541
Not just for the ICU. This is for Mom
and Dad and little Timmy's scraped knee

25:23.541 --> 25:25.583
because everyone has that in common.

25:25.583 --> 25:28.500
We all, all of us, know pain.

25:29.041 --> 25:30.833
It's the great equalizer.

25:30.833 --> 25:36.125
And this is the first pill
in history for all of us.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.958
In this little pill
is a world without pain.

25:43.083 --> 25:47.458
First, we hire the chemist.
Metzer, he developed Ligodone.

25:47.458 --> 25:51.000
Or even better, we buy Landor Pharma.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.875
The infrastructure's already
up and running.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.291
We get it to market
and we usher in a new world

25:55.291 --> 25:58.625
because this world... needs changing.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.916
- You work in this building?
- I do.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.458
Where?

26:07.458 --> 26:09.041
I'm on sub-two.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.625
So you're in the mail room?

26:10.625 --> 26:14.500
I'm in the communication logistics office.
I don't work in the mail room.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.625
A world without pain. That's pretty good.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.500
It's not just good. It's imminent.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.708
Well...

26:22.500 --> 26:23.500
Interesting.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.625
But drugs is a dirty business.

26:27.291 --> 26:30.041
It's a tricky business.
Especially with the Fuck Dicks.

26:30.708 --> 26:33.000
You've got trials, regulations, all that.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.166
We're dabbling in it a bit too right now.

26:35.166 --> 26:36.916
It's been nothing but a shit show so far.

26:36.916 --> 26:40.166
I'm cleaning up a huge mess as we speak.

26:40.166 --> 26:45.125
A drug trial that has cost me three years
and 20 fucking million on bad chemistry.

26:45.125 --> 26:48.416
And even if the chemistry goes perfect,
which it never will,

26:48.416 --> 26:51.166
you still have fines, bribes,
law suits, court--

26:51.166 --> 26:53.000
But on the other side of all that...

26:53.000 --> 26:54.875
Medical devices on the other hand...

26:56.208 --> 26:57.958
Now that's our bread and butter.

26:57.958 --> 27:01.166
It's still a pain in the ass, sure,
but way less complicated.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.041
Tangible.

27:03.041 --> 27:04.375
Practical.

27:04.375 --> 27:05.458
Physical.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.291
And hard enough without all the chemistry.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.416
How many people need

27:09.416 --> 27:12.583
that cardio-verter-defibrillator
we spent millions developing?

27:12.583 --> 27:15.458
What? 100k a year? Tops.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.791
A strong, universal,
non-addictive pain killer,

27:18.791 --> 27:21.333
we're talking a thousand times that, easy.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.375
Bigger than the numbers,
which will be huge,

27:24.375 --> 27:27.458
and bigger than the profits,
which will be astonishing,

27:27.458 --> 27:30.000
Fortunato won't just be
a medical care company,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.166
Fortunato will be a miracle.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.750
And you will be the new Messiah.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.166
This is how you change the world.

27:41.250 --> 27:44.500
My mother... she used to work here.

27:45.458 --> 27:48.000
She sat on that desk that Suz
is on right now.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.791
She gave her life to this company.

27:50.333 --> 27:55.583
And for years, towards the end,
she was in agony.

27:56.666 --> 27:57.916
Daily pain.

27:57.916 --> 28:02.666
Every minute, and I saw all of it,
and I knew it did not have to be that way.

28:03.625 --> 28:07.041
Yes, of course, you'll make billions
doing this, that's true.

28:08.791 --> 28:10.250
But that's not why you do it.

28:18.291 --> 28:19.833
[baby wailing]

28:22.541 --> 28:23.541
Well?

28:24.416 --> 28:25.250
Oh!

28:31.166 --> 28:35.166
I'm so sorry, sweetie. He's wrong.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.333
Hey, baby. Hey, it's okay.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.625
- You're going to stay with Mom.
- [Annabel] I know. It's okay.

28:43.791 --> 28:44.666
I saw her desk.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.833
- Smaller than I'd pictured.
- [Annabel] Whose desk?

28:47.875 --> 28:48.875
Our mom's.

28:49.541 --> 28:52.625
Wanted to for months. Today was
the first time I got into that office.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.916
Wow, that's amazing.

28:55.916 --> 28:57.166
Sorry about your pitch.

28:57.708 --> 28:59.916
I was glad to have some time
with your wife.

28:59.916 --> 29:02.291
I think today's the most time
I've spent with Annabel.

29:03.541 --> 29:07.000
And you're seeing me at my best,
that's for sure.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.708
I come out of these days feeling

29:10.708 --> 29:13.541
like I got beat with a pillowcase
full of doorknobs.

29:13.541 --> 29:14.625
Be quiet.

29:14.625 --> 29:16.208
Pardon my boob again.

29:17.916 --> 29:18.916
Hang on.

29:21.916 --> 29:25.333
I wonder... Maybe it's time
to move on from that place.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.208
Find another opportunity somewhere else?

29:28.208 --> 29:32.583
I know there's a connection for you there
because of your mom, and I guess your dad.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.375
Oh, you told her.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.958
"It was many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea

29:43.916 --> 29:45.166
"that a maiden there lived

29:45.166 --> 29:47.750
"whom you may know
by the name of Annabel Lee."

29:47.750 --> 29:49.583
- What's happening?
- Shh.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.500
"And this maiden she lived."

29:51.500 --> 29:52.666
[Annabel chuckles]

29:52.666 --> 29:56.041
"With no other thought
but to love and be loved by me."

29:57.750 --> 29:59.166
- [kissing]
- Vomit.

29:59.166 --> 30:00.333
[Roderick sighs]

30:00.333 --> 30:01.500
I quit my job today.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.125
What?

30:04.625 --> 30:05.750
These men.

30:06.791 --> 30:08.916
You'd think developing
a single-chip microprocessor

30:08.916 --> 30:13.166
would earn you a little respect,
but no, still just a fucking boys' club.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.875
Jerking each other off

30:14.875 --> 30:18.708
because they invented the microcontroller
chip in fucking Simon.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.916
Maybe someday you'll put a chip in a toy.

30:20.916 --> 30:24.083
[Annabel] I'm proud of you. Both of you.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.708
Roddy? You took a big swing.

30:26.708 --> 30:31.041
And Madeline, you're a goddamn genius.
You took a step out of a bad situation.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.875
The kids are healthy and happy,
we're together.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.125
Money isn't everything.

30:36.916 --> 30:38.458
- Hmm.
- We're okay.

30:38.458 --> 30:41.791
You're both
so fucking high-tech, impressive.

30:41.791 --> 30:45.083
Roderick with your medicine,
Madeline with your algorithms.

30:45.083 --> 30:48.000
Algorithms aren't high tech.
They've been around since antiquity.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.958
An algorithm is just a finite sequence
of all defined instructions

30:50.958 --> 30:53.500
to solve a problem,
or perform a computation.

30:53.500 --> 30:59.291
But, down the line, with computers,
we could use them for anything.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.625
Financial markets. Investments.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.708
Predictive medical care.

31:04.708 --> 31:08.416
Hell, an algorithm could write movies
and TV shows.

31:08.416 --> 31:10.000
- Not well.
- You'll see.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.041
Down the line, we could mimic
human consciousness.

31:14.041 --> 31:17.750
That is immortality talk right there.

31:17.750 --> 31:23.333
Yeah, but aren't there just some things
only we sad, little, flawed people can do?

31:23.875 --> 31:27.333
I mean, can an algorithm write a poem
the way Roderick does?

31:27.333 --> 31:28.458
[Madeline] Roddy.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.208
Fuck that tiny little man
in his big office

31:32.208 --> 31:34.666
with his tiny little ideas.

31:34.666 --> 31:37.625
We are going to change
the goddamn world,

31:37.625 --> 31:43.166
and if Fortunato won't help us get there,
we will trample them on our way.

31:44.791 --> 31:46.708
There's no such thing as a step back.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.333
You go forward.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.333
If you hit a brick wall,
you don't go back, you go through.

31:52.333 --> 31:56.000
Rufus Griswold is going to help us
go forward.

31:56.750 --> 32:00.875
Or we're going to go right through him
and leave him in pieces behind us.

32:03.375 --> 32:06.875
Jesus, Madeline.
When you get going, you get going.

32:08.541 --> 32:09.916
[Madeline] <i>Here's what'll happen.</i>

32:09.916 --> 32:12.750
Now you finally finished
all these questions,

32:12.750 --> 32:14.958
and I know that was a lot.

32:14.958 --> 32:16.500
A hundred thousand questions.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.416
It was ten thousand,
but I take your point.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.166
You finished the journal?

32:21.166 --> 32:23.333
Every day for four months. Like you said.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.291
Lenore.

32:26.291 --> 32:30.625
And now, the algorithm's going
to worm its way through the Internet.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.750
It's going to grab everything it can.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.750
Your Facebook, your Instagram,

32:34.750 --> 32:38.791
your profile, your posts,
your email, microdata.

32:38.791 --> 32:44.208
- And then it makes another me.
- An AI approximation, but, yeah. Maybe.

32:44.708 --> 32:49.541
A virtual you that thinks like you,
talks like you, is you.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.291
That's so cool.

32:51.291 --> 32:54.666
It is cool, isn't it?

32:54.666 --> 32:56.250
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.791
You see, what your granddad doesn't get

32:58.791 --> 33:03.791
is that this isn't about building
a chatbot.

33:03.791 --> 33:05.791
It's about legacy.

33:06.375 --> 33:11.666
See, the ancients, they all wanted to live
on after they died, well, everybody does.

33:11.666 --> 33:15.000
And they tried all this stuff,
mummification, pyramids,

33:15.000 --> 33:19.291
but speaking of mummification.

33:19.291 --> 33:22.041
This is straight from Egypt.

33:22.541 --> 33:28.708
They would take this
and shove it up the nose

33:28.708 --> 33:33.541
and pick out the brains bit by bit
before mummification.

33:33.541 --> 33:37.041
It is a new piece
for my immortality collection,

33:37.041 --> 33:39.125
and it is beautiful, and I'm gonna use--

33:39.125 --> 33:40.541
[Arthur] Got a minute?

33:41.333 --> 33:42.750
I'll go say hi to Grandpa.

33:42.750 --> 33:43.833
Okay, love.

33:47.666 --> 33:48.666
What is it?

33:48.666 --> 33:49.750
You were right.

33:50.458 --> 33:53.208
I got a look at Perry's bank statements.

33:53.208 --> 33:56.125
His spending's dropped a bit
in the last few months.

33:56.125 --> 33:59.666
I thought so. Either he's coming down
in his old age, or--

33:59.666 --> 34:01.416
Or he's spending more cash.

34:01.416 --> 34:05.291
Which can mean one of a few things.
He's dealing, pimping, or...

34:05.291 --> 34:08.333
- Or...
- Do the Feds still pay in cash?

34:08.333 --> 34:10.750
The government was always cash in my day.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.625
- What about the child bride?
- She doesn't have her own accounts.

34:14.625 --> 34:16.458
She's just co-signed on Roderick's.

34:16.458 --> 34:17.500
Of course.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.833
Okay, well, keep looking.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.291
We'll find them.

34:21.416 --> 34:23.083
- Surprise it's--
- Oh, fuck.

Hi, Grandpa. And... Grandma?

No. No, Jesus, no, never.
Never again. I'll hit you.

34:40.416 --> 34:41.375
How was your day?

34:41.375 --> 34:43.375
Good. Just visiting Nanna Madeline.

34:43.375 --> 34:47.333
Oh, that's right, she's turning you
into a video game. Or something.

Which ones are your favorites?

34:50.875 --> 34:52.208
We should play.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.875
- We should bond.

together in one room.

Well, that... That is a funny story.

35:16.375 --> 35:21.416
Actually,
I was in this awful car accident.

35:21.416 --> 35:23.041
I was shattered.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.750
Inside.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.708
More than three dozen fractures,
they just whipped off the old leg

35:28.708 --> 35:32.125
and your granddad happened to be visiting
the hospital on business,

35:32.125 --> 35:34.208
and I guess they wanted him to see me

35:34.208 --> 35:37.708
because I was on this dosage of Ligodone
that no one had ever been on before.

35:37.708 --> 35:41.000
And I was conscious and that was...
Well, that was fucking bizarre,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.625
and the doctors,
they were all gossiping about it.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.083
And he came to my ICU room,

35:45.083 --> 35:47.375
and he asked me how
I was enjoying the pills.

35:47.375 --> 35:51.083
And I was like,
"I literally fucking love the pills."

35:51.083 --> 35:53.416

that invented them!

35:53.416 --> 35:58.125

I could just blow him and--

48:37.958 --> 48:39.250
Who are you?

48:42.208 --> 48:43.875
I thought you'd never catch up.

48:44.416 --> 48:46.291
- Well, you don't make it easy.
- Hmm.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.208
Nothing worth having is ever easy.

48:49.375 --> 48:50.875
You didn't answer my question.

48:51.750 --> 48:52.583
Who are you?

48:53.416 --> 48:54.541
I know everybody here.

48:55.541 --> 48:58.833
I chose this guest list very carefully
and I have no idea who you are.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.458
You can take off your mask, Prospero.

49:06.375 --> 49:07.375
You know my name.

49:08.333 --> 49:09.625
I know everyone here.

49:10.541 --> 49:11.666
It's my kind of party.

49:12.541 --> 49:13.791
It's yours too, isn't it?

49:14.916 --> 49:15.916
Do you like it?

49:15.916 --> 49:17.000
I do.

49:18.250 --> 49:20.041
Mmm. The music.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.166
The lights.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.375
The beautiful flesh.

49:24.250 --> 49:27.041
So pretty and soft.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.416
But the smells of it.

49:32.333 --> 49:37.750
All that sweat, the perfumes,
the lotions, the musk.

49:39.666 --> 49:41.583
Sex, yes.

49:43.083 --> 49:45.125
But with a dash of Rome.

49:47.333 --> 49:49.666
Tell me, and don't lie.

49:50.916 --> 49:52.916
Is it everything you wanted it to be?

49:54.500 --> 49:55.333
Not yet.

49:56.375 --> 49:57.375
Almost.

49:57.958 --> 50:00.250
Nearly realized is the sweetest.

50:02.041 --> 50:08.750
It's better, I promise, in the moment
just before than in the moment after.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.291
That is the truth of this world.

50:12.291 --> 50:13.666
But you did it.

50:14.208 --> 50:16.291
And it's everything you imagined.

50:17.250 --> 50:19.750
And there's still time.

50:21.708 --> 50:22.958
To what?

50:24.541 --> 50:25.541
To stop it.

50:27.833 --> 50:33.250
Things like this, all things,
in fact, have consequences.

50:34.208 --> 50:35.291
Not this.

50:35.291 --> 50:38.166
That's the whole point.
You didn't read the invite?

50:38.166 --> 50:40.416
There are always consequences.

50:42.833 --> 50:44.583
Take you, for instance.

50:45.333 --> 50:48.875
Someone, a long time ago,
made a little decision,

50:49.750 --> 50:55.333
then another, then a big one,
then one of absolutely no importance.

50:56.083 --> 50:58.916
And then by and by, you were born.

51:00.083 --> 51:04.541
On that day, you were the consequence
of a harmless choice

51:04.541 --> 51:07.500
made by someone in a moment
where you didn't even exist.

51:08.375 --> 51:11.791
And that choice defined your whole life.

51:13.916 --> 51:16.833
You are consequence, Perry.

51:18.166 --> 51:21.166
And tonight, you are consequential.

51:24.833 --> 51:28.583
Oh, you are one crazy, trippy, hot bitch.
Aren't you?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.833
We could have had fun, you and me.

51:33.041 --> 51:34.541
Well, the night's young.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.125
We can have all the fun you want.

51:37.916 --> 51:40.750
I've always liked the bad boys.

51:42.125 --> 51:43.958
Got a weakness, I suppose.

51:46.375 --> 51:48.083
And you bad boys...

51:50.041 --> 51:54.916
you always just loved me.

51:56.625 --> 51:57.583
[chuckles]

51:59.375 --> 52:05.291
You are a pretty, pretty little thing.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
