WEBVTT

00:05.016 --> 00:07.889
Previously on Mystery Inc...

00:08.129 --> 00:10.531
The men and I were overtaken
with a desire

00:10.599 --> 00:12.533
to find this great treasure.

00:12.601 --> 00:15.370
Find it, we did.

00:15.437 --> 00:17.972
In our thirst
for power and wealth,

00:18.039 --> 00:20.641
we had discovered
a terrible evil.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.844
I used the alchemical disc
de planosferico

00:22.911 --> 00:24.479
to map our location,

00:24.546 --> 00:27.849
and we buried the evil treasure
deep, deep underground.

00:27.916 --> 00:30.518
The planespheric disc.

00:30.586 --> 00:33.220
They have 3 pieces.
We have 3 pieces.

00:33.288 --> 00:36.591
We have to find out which member
of the gang is keeping the pieces.

00:36.658 --> 00:38.092
Our son!

00:38.159 --> 00:41.562
Question is,
will they be willing to betray

00:41.630 --> 00:43.798
their only son?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:52.508 --> 00:54.842
Yeah! That's right!

00:54.910 --> 00:56.944
Eat the jams.
Eat 'em!

00:57.012 --> 00:58.780
Eat all my loud jams!

01:04.519 --> 01:06.854
What are you lookin' at, oldie?

01:06.922 --> 01:08.623
- Uh--
- What's that?

01:08.690 --> 01:11.526
I'm sorry, I can't hear you,

01:11.593 --> 01:13.628
because you're old!

01:13.695 --> 01:15.930
Hmmph!

01:26.308 --> 01:29.944
Krampus thinks you need
to respect your elders,

01:30.011 --> 01:32.046
other people's property,

01:32.113 --> 01:35.483
and the right to a quiet night!

01:37.786 --> 01:39.487
Krampus?

01:39.555 --> 01:41.589
Why don't you
just call yourself Dorkus?

01:41.657 --> 01:42.990
Or Lamus?

02:21.530 --> 02:23.698
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

02:35.438 --> 02:37.406
- Hey, there, son.
- What are you doing, dear?

02:37.474 --> 02:39.941
- Yeah. What's in the...
- Briefcase?

02:40.010 --> 02:41.110
Glad you asked!

02:41.177 --> 02:42.444
Mom, dad,

02:42.512 --> 02:43.945
I've got something important
to say.

02:44.014 --> 02:45.647
Since you've come back
into my life,

02:45.715 --> 02:47.449
I finally feel
for the first time ever

02:47.517 --> 02:49.284
that I can trust adults.

02:49.352 --> 02:50.719
Oh, Fred!

02:50.786 --> 02:53.188
We are glad
you feel that way, son.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.492
And because of that, if anything
should happen to me or the gang,

02:56.559 --> 02:58.827
I want you to have
what's in this briefcase.

02:58.895 --> 02:59.928
We could take it right now.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.930
Oh, no. That's OK.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.732
I'm going to put it
in the Mystery Machine for now

03:03.799 --> 03:05.334
so I can keep
a close eye on it.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.669
The gang and I are checking out
some weird goat guy

03:07.737 --> 03:09.238
who's terrorizing kids.

03:09.305 --> 03:11.640
You know duty--
it calls.

03:11.707 --> 03:14.309
It's so great having you both
in my life again.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.812
Keep your trip wire taut.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.315
And your tensile line strong.

03:23.319 --> 03:24.753
- Ricky? It's Brad.
- And Judy.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.522
Go ahead, you two.

03:26.589 --> 03:29.324
Tell Professor Pericles the
rest of the planespheric disc...

03:29.392 --> 03:31.760
Is ours for the taking.

03:33.329 --> 03:34.863
Something's been bugging me

03:34.931 --> 03:36.698
about our little
underwater escapade.

03:36.766 --> 03:39.368
There's a lot about that adventure
I wish we could forget.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.503
Amen to that.

03:41.571 --> 03:44.039
But the weirdest part of all was what
the late Abigail Gluck whispered.

03:44.107 --> 03:45.541
Like, I'll say.

03:45.608 --> 03:47.909
A crazy mummified corpse
whispering "Nibiru" is

03:47.977 --> 03:49.378
creepy times 10!

03:49.446 --> 03:50.745
It gets creepier.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.915
I googled it and found a lot,
namely this--

03:53.983 --> 03:57.619
"Nibiru" is a planet listed in the
writings of Zacharius Sitchen,

03:57.687 --> 03:59.888
particularly his book
"The Twelfth Planet."

03:59.956 --> 04:01.790
According to
Sitchen's interpretation

04:01.857 --> 04:03.692
of Babylonian religious texts,

04:03.759 --> 04:08.464
a giant planet called Nibiru
passes by earth every 3,600 years

04:08.531 --> 04:12.134
and allows its sentient inhabitants
to interact with humanity.

04:12.202 --> 04:14.436
These beings,
which Sitchen identified

04:14.504 --> 04:16.137
with the Annunaki
of Sumerian myth,

04:16.206 --> 04:19.241
would become
humanity's first gods.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.743
My favorite Internet
encyclopedia says

04:21.810 --> 04:23.778
there's supposed to be
a collision.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.381
The Nibiru collision is
a disastrous encounter

04:26.449 --> 04:29.618
between the earth
and a large planetary object.

04:30.886 --> 04:32.821
Believers
in this doomsday event

04:32.888 --> 04:35.457
usually refer to this object
as planet "X,"

04:35.525 --> 04:37.326
or Nibiru.

04:37.393 --> 04:40.695
Doomsday event?

04:53.143 --> 04:55.777
Like, what's the connection
between Nibiru

04:55.845 --> 04:57.579
and that crazy old German lady?

04:57.647 --> 04:59.981
Honestly, I have no idea.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.531
Ohh! Not only is this game
totally fake, it's broken!

05:20.270 --> 05:21.836
You were saying?

05:21.904 --> 05:24.540
It's only 'cause I'm used
to shooting live targets

05:24.607 --> 05:26.808
and not video hooligans.

05:26.876 --> 05:28.477
I'm going to go check out
that kid playing

05:28.545 --> 05:30.045
"Prance Prance Evolution."

05:30.112 --> 05:32.481
Those are some
very suspicious dance moves.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.982
I'm glad you kids are here.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.584
So what's this about a monster

05:35.652 --> 05:37.786
turning kids' hair white
with fear?

05:37.853 --> 05:39.154
Sounds kind of old school.

05:39.222 --> 05:40.789
He calls himself Krampus,

05:40.856 --> 05:43.925
and apparently, he has something
against bad children.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.994
Now, normally,
I wouldn't have a problem

05:46.062 --> 05:47.829
with getting delinquents
off the streets,

05:47.897 --> 05:50.399
but parents are complaining
that their kids are afraid

05:50.466 --> 05:52.334
to sleep without the lights on,

05:52.402 --> 05:54.803
and that's putting a strain
on the Crystal Cove power grid.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.338
We'd be glad to help you.

05:56.406 --> 05:58.574
But, like, why are we meeting
in an arcade?

05:58.641 --> 06:01.610
Oh, jeez. You call
yourselves investigators?

06:01.678 --> 06:04.145
Everyone knows arcades
and roller discos are

06:04.214 --> 06:06.348
breeding grounds
for criminal children.

06:06.416 --> 06:08.817
These places are basically
coin-operated prisons.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.992
It's nice taking
the old enigma machine out

06:18.060 --> 06:20.762
for a little dark, evil action.

06:20.830 --> 06:23.732
- You certainly kept...
- This baby in great shape.

06:23.799 --> 06:25.234
Stay focused.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.437
We must secure the 3 pieces
of the planespheric disc

06:28.504 --> 06:30.505
ma schnell! Schnell!

06:37.447 --> 06:40.782
My corn dog went up my nose!

06:40.850 --> 06:42.584
Uh, are you going to eat that?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.487
Yeah!
10-second nose rule!

06:51.694 --> 06:55.230
Stop!
You female hooligans!

06:55.298 --> 06:56.865
Huh?

07:12.382 --> 07:16.551
Krampus thinks you have been
bad, bad little girls!

07:16.619 --> 07:20.054
Und since your parents seem
helpless to act,

07:20.122 --> 07:24.559
it is time for Krampus to
teach you some manners!

07:31.367 --> 07:33.702
There he is!

07:40.176 --> 07:42.076
Krampus is getting away!
Come on!

07:42.144 --> 07:44.413
Um, like, that's OK!

07:44.480 --> 07:46.415
We'll stay here and deal with
the bigger issue--

07:46.482 --> 07:48.917
namely, all the abandoned
corn dogs around here

07:48.984 --> 07:50.752
that suddenly need a new home!

07:50.820 --> 07:54.189
Yeah, in our bellies.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.694
That's our boy.

07:58.761 --> 08:01.095
This is going to take
longer than we thought.

08:01.163 --> 08:03.598
- A lot longer.
- Yes. A lot longer.

08:03.666 --> 08:05.967
- Thank you, Brad.
- You're welcome, Judy.

08:09.372 --> 08:11.340
Time to go. Move it.

08:16.679 --> 08:21.149
I look like some smelly
wizard from center earth.

08:23.118 --> 08:26.054
Gang, we really need to
do something about Krampus.

08:26.121 --> 08:29.658
I'll say. Even bad children
don't deserve this.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.989
Well, gang,
the mayor was right.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.024
Krampus is well-known
in German folklore

08:46.092 --> 08:49.595
as sort of a boogeyman who has
a real problem with bad kids.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.252
And he's, like, crazy ugly.

08:51.385 --> 08:53.486
With a club made of sticks.

08:53.554 --> 08:55.555
Yeah. Like,
what's up with that?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.189
They're called switches,

08:57.257 --> 08:58.991
and he used to punish
bad children with them

08:59.059 --> 09:00.360
back in the old country.

09:00.427 --> 09:03.195
Jeez.
The old country was rough.

09:03.263 --> 09:06.432
It says here he usually only
appears during the winter months.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.301
So this is a bit of
an off-season appearance.

09:09.370 --> 09:10.903
Hmm.

09:13.407 --> 09:15.641
Fred, are you OK?

09:15.709 --> 09:17.343
I don't know, Daphne.

09:17.411 --> 09:19.144
This whole thing
about Krampus--

09:19.212 --> 09:21.848
stern, disciplinarian,
cold, and impartial--

09:21.915 --> 09:26.151
he--he makes me think
of my former father, mayor dad.

09:26.219 --> 09:27.687
Go on.

09:27.755 --> 09:31.023
Well, my not-dad was always
super critical of me.

09:31.091 --> 09:32.825
And I could never
understand why.

09:32.893 --> 09:35.595
But in a weird way,
I kind of miss the attention.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.230
Oh, Freddie.
There's something missing!

09:38.298 --> 09:39.799
I know.
I just said that.

09:39.867 --> 09:42.368
No, there's something missing
over there.

09:42.436 --> 09:44.904
That's Charlie
the haunted robot's spot.

09:44.971 --> 09:47.807
He's one of the museum's
biggest draws.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.141
We better tell the others.

09:51.278 --> 09:53.646
This Krampus mystery is
certainly...

09:53.714 --> 09:56.081
Very intriguing.

09:56.149 --> 09:58.918
Oh, it is no mystery at all.

09:58.985 --> 10:02.522
Krampus, dear Krampus.

10:02.589 --> 10:06.258
I have such fond memories
of Krampus from when

10:06.326 --> 10:08.193
I was just a hatchling.

10:08.261 --> 10:12.498
I can still hear the sound of
Krampus visiting bad children

10:12.566 --> 10:15.334
on a cold winter's night.

10:15.402 --> 10:19.104
Ah, the screams of
fear and terror.

10:19.172 --> 10:22.475
Mmm. It's so soothing.

10:25.679 --> 10:27.613
Fond memories aside,

10:27.681 --> 10:29.849
this Krampus may present
a problem.

10:29.917 --> 10:33.018
I am not so sure, Ricky.
The vault!

10:51.839 --> 10:54.907
We must let nothing stop us
from retrieving

10:54.975 --> 10:57.477
the other 3 pieces
of the planespheric disc

10:57.544 --> 10:58.978
from the kinder.

10:59.045 --> 11:03.048
Perhaps Krampus is exactly
the distraction we need.

11:03.116 --> 11:06.285
I'm not sure what Charlie the
robot has to do with Krampus.

11:06.353 --> 11:07.820
We need more.

11:07.888 --> 11:10.590
We need to anticipate
where Krampus will strike next.

11:10.657 --> 11:12.792
Yeah. Like,
if we could put all the bad kids

11:12.860 --> 11:14.326
from Crystal Cove in one place,

11:14.394 --> 11:15.962
I'm sure Krampus would
just show up.

11:16.029 --> 11:17.964
That's it!
Maybe we can't get

11:18.031 --> 11:19.565
all the bad kids in one place,

11:19.633 --> 11:22.468
but I know the one place
that holds the baddest kid.

11:22.536 --> 11:24.436
Come on, gang.

11:27.908 --> 11:30.309
So what do you say?
You want to help?

11:33.146 --> 11:36.682
You want me to use myself as
bait for this evil goat-man?

11:38.451 --> 11:40.620
Frederick Jones,
I've learned 53 things

11:40.687 --> 11:42.254
since my time here on the rock.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.757
The first 52 involve
how to make lethal weapons

11:44.825 --> 11:47.159
out of my pigtails.
The other is...

11:49.195 --> 11:50.997
Always look out for numero uno.

11:51.064 --> 11:52.765
What's in it for me?

11:52.833 --> 11:54.199
"Dear parole board,

11:54.267 --> 11:57.036
please consider
Mary Anne Gleardan's cooperation

11:57.103 --> 11:58.771
with the kids
of Mystery, Inc.,

11:58.839 --> 12:01.674
as a means of giving her
time off for good behavior."

12:01.742 --> 12:03.242
Let me see that!

12:05.378 --> 12:06.979
Hey, Scooby-Doo,

12:07.047 --> 12:08.848
let's see if we can find
the chow line.

12:08.916 --> 12:12.284
Like, I think I smelled
the cafeteria on our way in.

12:12.352 --> 12:14.219
Well, follow my nose!

12:19.693 --> 12:23.529
Like, dude, way to go,
Scooby's nose! Hoo-hoo!

12:45.986 --> 12:47.219
What are you in for?

12:47.287 --> 12:49.288
The food!

12:50.323 --> 12:53.059
Excuse me, Mr. prison convict.

12:53.126 --> 12:54.927
Like, mind if we sit down?

12:54.995 --> 12:57.262
It's a free country.

13:03.103 --> 13:06.038
You're going to be in danger
anyway from Krampus, Mary Anne.

13:06.106 --> 13:07.873
You might as well help
with his capture.

13:07.941 --> 13:10.442
Your theory is built
on a weak hypothesis

13:10.510 --> 13:12.945
that does not stand up
to scientific scrutiny.

13:13.013 --> 13:15.114
Answer's still no.

13:15.181 --> 13:16.716
I got nothing to worry about.

13:16.783 --> 13:18.751
I'm in prison, remember?

13:24.658 --> 13:28.193
Do not be so sure about that.

13:37.504 --> 13:39.972
Run, Mary Anne! Run!

13:42.308 --> 13:43.776
Freddie! No!

13:46.847 --> 13:50.315
It's OK. I'm fine.
Come on.

13:51.718 --> 13:53.452
Ohh!

14:20.413 --> 14:22.982
Come on, guys!
We can't let Krampus get away!

14:23.050 --> 14:24.984
Um, we'll be
right with you--

14:25.052 --> 14:26.585
like, just as soon as we finish

14:26.653 --> 14:29.755
our delicious two-month-old
prison cobbler.

14:48.075 --> 14:51.110
We were so close!

14:51.178 --> 14:53.813
The only thing I hate worse
than not finishing a trap...

14:53.880 --> 14:55.514
Is almost finishing it!

14:55.582 --> 14:58.450
Come on!
We can't let Krampus get away!

15:32.604 --> 15:34.771
It's the old haunted
toy factory.

15:34.839 --> 15:36.673
Didn't they turn this place
into an orphanage?

15:36.741 --> 15:38.142
No, Daph, you're thinking of

15:38.210 --> 15:40.711
the old haunted orphanage
across the street.

15:42.647 --> 15:45.649
Like, dude,
this place is uber creepy.

15:45.717 --> 15:47.351
Why would Krampus go in there?

15:47.419 --> 15:50.821
Because it's the worst place
he could possibly go.

15:58.330 --> 16:02.566
Now, Brad, now, Judy.
Let us finish this.

16:40.072 --> 16:42.506
Gang, the conveyer belt!
Come on!

16:42.574 --> 16:44.575
Split up!
Go down each side!

16:50.215 --> 16:52.916
Mama. Da-da.

16:52.984 --> 16:54.618
Ma-ma. Da-da.

16:54.686 --> 16:57.788
Like, I hope
they're not talking to us!

16:57.855 --> 17:01.125
Yeah!
I'm too young to be a da-da!

17:03.728 --> 17:07.298
Now, guys! Pull the ropes!
Grab the tarps!

17:28.252 --> 17:30.588
Thank you, Frederick.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.132
Now,

17:41.199 --> 17:43.501
let's see
who Krampus really is.

17:44.969 --> 17:47.605
Charlie the haunted robot?

17:47.672 --> 17:50.541
- Like, what?
- That doesn't make sense.

17:50.609 --> 17:53.110
Charlie isn't human,
so that means...

17:53.178 --> 17:54.911
Someone must be
controlling him.

17:54.979 --> 17:56.780
But who?

18:06.224 --> 18:07.791
Who's that?

18:07.859 --> 18:10.794
Like, it has to be
the old Mystery, Incorporated.

18:10.862 --> 18:12.596
But why were they here?

18:12.664 --> 18:15.466
I'll tell you why--
because they took it.

18:15.534 --> 18:17.501
They took the briefcase.

18:19.003 --> 18:21.272
- Perfect.
- All the pieces of...

18:21.339 --> 18:23.374
The planespheric disc are ours!

18:23.441 --> 18:26.577
I believe it's time to
put all of it together.

18:35.353 --> 18:36.753
I don't understand.

18:36.821 --> 18:38.556
Where are our pieces?

18:45.063 --> 18:46.564
If you're watching this,

18:46.631 --> 18:48.499
you're probably wondering
what's happened

18:48.567 --> 18:50.701
to your pieces
of the planespheric disc.

18:50.768 --> 18:54.771
In a word, you've been scammed,
conned, bamboozled.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.139
That's 3 words, Fred,

18:56.208 --> 18:57.808
but I think they get the idea.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.143
- We did this to you.
- Yeah.

19:00.212 --> 19:03.714
And we will be more than happy
to tell you how we did it.

19:03.781 --> 19:05.882
It was all
an elaborate plan masterminded

19:05.950 --> 19:08.452
by your very own Freddie.

19:10.021 --> 19:13.023
We created Krampus by borrowing
Charlie the haunted robot

19:13.091 --> 19:14.925
and dressing him up in
clothes we bought off

19:14.992 --> 19:18.362
German gypsies who live in
Crystal Cove's haunted forest.

19:18.430 --> 19:20.464
As for Krampus moving around,

19:20.532 --> 19:22.899
he was being remote controlled
by Jason Wyatt,

19:22.967 --> 19:27.070
who agreed to help for lenience from
the mayor on his mother's sentence.

19:27.138 --> 19:30.140
Like, Jason also helped create
an invisible aerosol

19:30.208 --> 19:31.742
that was used to
turn hair white

19:31.809 --> 19:35.412
and make it grow long
for added effect.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.548
We needed to keep you away
from the vault.

19:37.616 --> 19:39.816
You following us
following Krampus was

19:39.884 --> 19:41.318
the perfect way
to keep you distracted

19:41.386 --> 19:43.354
so we could carry out
our master plan--

19:43.421 --> 19:45.589
breaking into
Mr. E.'s vault.

19:47.525 --> 19:50.728
Freddy planted a bug
on Brad chiles' clothing

19:50.795 --> 19:52.496
so that we could get
the code to the vault.

19:54.566 --> 19:56.567
And once we had that code...

19:56.635 --> 19:59.403
We could give it
to our operative.

20:01.706 --> 20:05.108
Someone with intimate knowledge
of Mr. E's lair--

20:05.176 --> 20:07.210
Hot Dog Water.

20:07.279 --> 20:08.779
Hot dog water?

20:08.846 --> 20:11.014
I still know
how to get in touch with her.

20:11.082 --> 20:14.217
Like, when Velma told Hot Dog
Water what we had planned,

20:14.286 --> 20:16.920
HDW was in.

20:16.988 --> 20:19.856
And while we stole
the real pieces...

20:19.924 --> 20:23.260
You were stealing fake ones.

20:23.328 --> 20:26.630
The real pieces were instead
safely hidden

20:26.698 --> 20:30.033
with the one person
no one would ever suspect--

20:30.101 --> 20:34.070
Fred's fake father,
the ex-mayor Jones.

20:34.138 --> 20:38.475
My not-really-my-dad dad may have
betrayed us once to get the disc pieces,

20:38.543 --> 20:40.311
but when he heard
what we were planning,

20:40.378 --> 20:43.113
he was more than glad
to help us take you down.

20:43.181 --> 20:45.616
And, like, Mary Anne Gleardan
also agreed to help us

20:45.684 --> 20:49.320
after the current mayor offered
her lenience on her sentence.

20:49.387 --> 20:52.456
She really wants to go back
to the seventh grade.

20:52.524 --> 20:55.058
I guess I secretly hoped
you guys might not try

20:55.126 --> 20:56.660
to steal the pieces from us.

20:56.728 --> 20:58.895
But I guess
I always knew you would.

20:58.963 --> 21:01.498
Which leaves me
with only one thing left to say.

21:01.566 --> 21:05.268
Real mom, real dad,
don't expect me home for dinner.

21:05.337 --> 21:07.070
Ever.

21:07.138 --> 21:09.206
And we're taking nova
with us, too.

21:09.273 --> 21:11.174
You don't deserve her.

21:16.914 --> 21:18.915
Oh. Let's see
what it looks like--

21:18.983 --> 21:21.251
the whole planespheric disc.

21:26.424 --> 21:28.959
Like, whoa.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.328
It's...beautiful.

21:31.396 --> 21:33.163
We have the whole thing.

21:33.231 --> 21:35.198
That leaves only one question.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.267
What do we do now?

21:48.179 --> 21:51.515
Nibiru.

21:52.305 --> 21:58.432
