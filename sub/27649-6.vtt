WEBVTT

00:01.227 --> 00:04.587
That's a foot in a pizza bag. Let's see
if we can find the rest of this body.

00:05.060 --> 00:08.895
Dismembering a body by hand is hard work.
It takes time, not to mention the mess.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.520
You can't tell anyone I was with
you. No more messages.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.400
- I thought you lost your phone.
- Just make sure you lose my number.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.055
CLARISSA: If these body parts are from
the same body, what you're looking at

00:19.080 --> 00:21.320
is an irezumi bodysuit.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.080
TARAMELLI: So no identifiable DNA,
but we do have the tattoos.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.400
Which we can show to
the various tattooists in Brighton.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.895
- Does this tattooist have a name?
- This is his unique signature.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.320
The carving butterfly.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.560
- Is that the head?
- JACK: Left arm. It's an irezumi.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.280
But we already have a left arm.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.540
Excuse me?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.280
He's taking the moped!

00:41.540 --> 00:44.260
TARAMELLI: A second dismembered body.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

02:00.340 --> 02:01.740
What fun.

03:14.243 --> 03:15.643
Sir...

03:17.043 --> 03:19.723
Not the yakuza gangster
I was expecting.

03:30.483 --> 03:32.523
Akito Emon?

03:34.644 --> 03:35.820
Police!

03:44.510 --> 03:46.820
SIREN WAILS

03:51.260 --> 03:54.655
Akito Emon, I am arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

03:55.016 --> 03:55.920
Murder?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.840
You do not have to say anything,
but anything you do say...

04:03.635 --> 04:05.200
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.271
This place is so quiet
when no-one else is here.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.900
What's up?

04:15.100 --> 04:16.220
Clarissa?

04:16.540 --> 04:18.100
I couldn't sleep.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.220
There's something about this case
that's...

04:20.220 --> 04:21.660
Like a jigsaw without a picture.

04:21.660 --> 04:24.655
And we won't know what it is
until we find the final piece,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.240
which is not unlike this little lot.

04:27.860 --> 04:31.320
But I've located two serial numbers,

04:31.320 --> 04:35.720
so we should be able to identify the
vehicles involved in the accident.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.040
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.560
Sorry I'm late.
It's usually the trains,

04:44.560 --> 04:47.920
- but this morning, we finally caught up with
the moped driver. - Did you find the moped?

04:47.920 --> 04:51.255
No, just the driver. A young woman
who works for the pizza restaurant.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.640
You think she's involved
with the two murders?

04:53.640 --> 04:55.640
Innocent people don't run.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.800
As you can see, the body's been
extensively disrupted.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.440
It's been decapitated,

05:09.440 --> 05:11.480
and all four limbs removed,

05:11.480 --> 05:14.280
possibly as a result of falling into
the recycling mechanism,

05:14.280 --> 05:16.600
could have happened earlier,
or a combination of both.

05:16.780 --> 05:22.820
I'll examine each body part to determine
exactly... how it was amputated.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.920
Poor man.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.980
Who could do such a thing?

05:27.540 --> 05:31.460
There's bruising to the chest
and lacerations to the face.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.660
They both exhibit signs of
vital reactions.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.482
That means this man suffered a number
of serious injuries before he died,

05:40.652 --> 05:43.980
including what appears to be
a sharp-force wound to his abdomen.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.136
There's a stab wound,
orientated transversely,

05:49.400 --> 05:53.180
measuring 4cm long,
with the edges opposed.

05:54.260 --> 05:58.935
It penetrates the skin and enters
deeply into the peritoneal cavity.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.580
Can you say if it's the same knife
that killed the first man?

06:03.420 --> 06:06.740
It's possible, but hard to say
unless we find the knife.

06:10.020 --> 06:14.560
- A koi swimming up a current of water.
- Like the first body.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.787
What about the others?

06:18.760 --> 06:21.375
They appear to be from different
parts of the world.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.680
I'll send the images to Heisuke.

06:23.820 --> 06:27.215
The tattoos on the left leg, left
arm and shoulder have been torn,

06:27.240 --> 06:29.000
in some cases partially destroyed,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.880
either by the dismembering
or the recycling process.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.720
I'm hoping, as the search continues,
more parts will turn up

06:34.720 --> 06:37.560
- and we can complete the picture.
- His body's like a travelogue.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.320
This man travels all over the world

06:39.780 --> 06:43.060
and ends up in a recycling bin
in a back street in Brighton.

06:46.060 --> 06:48.360
- Nine o'clock.
- OK.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.740
This is Akito's room?

06:57.100 --> 07:00.780
You will see she has got
something of a shrine to her family.

07:18.066 --> 07:21.040
- She wants to be a surgeon, apparently.
- Uh-huh?

07:31.900 --> 07:32.840
What is it?

07:32.840 --> 07:33.900
Pizza bags.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.248
- HE SIGHS
- Let's see.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.380
Dirty washing.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.820
One for colours, one for whites.

08:07.660 --> 08:10.900
Piracetam, Modafinil.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.920
She's got attention deficit disorder?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.615
Possibly, but judging
by the quantity,

08:16.640 --> 08:18.440
I'd say it was more likely she was
selling them on.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.380
Keeps you awake,
so you can study longer.

08:20.740 --> 08:23.535
I don't think two men have been
brutally murdered and cut up

08:23.560 --> 08:26.520
for the sake of some students thinking
they'll get better exam results.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.160
- We'll get some dogs in.
- Right.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.655
A compass, a Yale key
and an ignition key on a fob.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.280
Can you find out where it might have
come from?

08:36.280 --> 08:39.720
I'll try. It should tell us
what make of vehicle at least.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.280
£6.40 in coins

08:43.280 --> 08:45.480
and a very bloody £20 note.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.815
- Any credit cards? A wallet?
- Not yet.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.360
Chances are they fell out in the bin
or the recycling centre

08:51.360 --> 08:53.080
or during the fight that put him
there.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.200
Anything else on the clothing?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.280
Apart from a lot of blood...

08:57.780 --> 09:02.280
There are these spatters of blood
at the top of the shirt.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.360
Won't they have come
from the man himself?

09:04.360 --> 09:05.400
Possibly.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.855
The pattern, though, suggests blood
coming from another source.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.540
You mean from the person or people
who attacked him?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
Just got to swab your hand.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.540
May I?

09:33.980 --> 09:35.620
Is that a cigarette burn?

09:39.060 --> 09:43.615
You told us you were attacked
in Dover Street at around 7pm.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.440
He threw me to the ground.
I was in shock.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.280
Is that how you got those bruises?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.040
They look more recent to me.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.880
Has someone been hurting you, Akito?

09:53.140 --> 09:57.620
My crash helmet has got a camera on it.
That will prove that I'm not lying.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.100
And where might this
crash helmet be, Akito?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.340
The man took it with the bike.

10:02.700 --> 10:06.320
Could this alleged incident
have happened in Church Street?

10:06.320 --> 10:08.600
No. I didn't go to
Church Street that night.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.400
BOTH SPEAK IN JAPANESE

10:11.400 --> 10:13.742
We found these under
your bed, Akito.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.880
16 packs of Modafinil,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.120
21 packs of Piracetam.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.560
I give them to my friends.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.080
QUICKE: And where do
you get them from?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.780
I buy them from someone, OK?
I don't know their name.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.340
We found these at the rubbish dump.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.940
Just like the ones we found
under your bed.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.400
- I deliver pizzas for this restaurant.
- The pizza bag

10:42.400 --> 10:45.935
had a man's dismembered foot in it.
Both the bag and the pizza box

10:45.960 --> 10:48.040
have your fingerprints on them, Akito.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.880
Akito...

10:50.080 --> 10:51.500
..we want to help you.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.740
We'll believe everything you say
when you start

10:54.740 --> 10:56.380
telling us what really happened.

11:02.654 --> 11:06.820
If I tell you the truth, Detective,
they will kill me.

11:09.860 --> 11:13.820
Akito is claiming that her bike was
stolen at around 7pm

11:13.820 --> 11:16.220
on that Thursday night in Dover Street.

11:17.485 --> 11:18.940
But look at this...

11:20.140 --> 11:23.580
taken at 8.46.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.080
She clearly didn't clock the CCTV camera

11:30.080 --> 11:31.720
on the neighbouring house
she was delivering to.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.983
Was she mistaken about the time,
or is she lying?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.000
Well, the restaurant will have
a record of deliveries she made

11:38.000 --> 11:39.920
- and what time she made them, won't they?
- True.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.895
- Pig bones!
- You say the nicest things, Thomas.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.440
Find out if the saw Jack found
was used to dismember

11:45.440 --> 11:48.095
- both those bodies.
- They're in the cold store.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.100
That saw has been examined for
all trace evidence, hasn't it?

11:51.340 --> 11:53.895
And we're awaiting the results...

11:53.920 --> 11:55.560
- That's right.
- Thank you.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.940
- PHONE VIBRATES
- It's Matt!

12:03.920 --> 12:06.920
- Do you want to...?
- Uh...

12:07.520 --> 12:09.480
No. It's fine. I'll...

12:11.920 --> 12:15.720
You know you can talk to me.
To any of us.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.200
I know, I know.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.520
You seem a little preoccupied.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.480
Everything's fine.

12:23.037 --> 12:24.157
Really?

12:27.960 --> 12:30.260
I just... thought I was pregnant...

12:31.460 --> 12:32.900
and I'm not.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.820
And Matt doesn't know.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.960
It's a conversation we need
to have face to face.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.320
Yeah.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.540
QUICKE: Yes. Yes, I can.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.300
See you shortly.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.380
That was Andrew Dewey.
He wants to speak to me.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.480
Said it was urgent.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.640
Organise a search of Stephen's
house, get some DNA. And Andrew's.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.500
Both had access to apartment 3.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.175
Let Akito stew for a bit.
She might talk then.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.320
You really think Akito
killed those two men?

13:10.320 --> 13:11.680
Chopped them up?

13:12.100 --> 13:16.140
One thing you learn from this job:
people are capable of anything.

13:20.839 --> 13:23.320
The broken plastic you found
in Church Street...

13:23.320 --> 13:24.040
Got a match?

13:24.040 --> 13:28.135
The front light and indicator belong
to a Peugeot moped.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.440
The same model Akito
was riding that night.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.720
And what did it collide with?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.280
It was a Ford van.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.720
Pre 2008.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.960
There was a man.
He came in looking for Stephen.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.520
He said he'd called but got no
answer, so he came here.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.560
He seemed really upset, and yesterday,
when you asked if Stephen had a tattoo,

15:21.560 --> 15:23.560
I remembered the man
had one on his arm.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.600
- What kind of tattoo?
- It looked like a fish.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.440
Just here.
Could it have been... Japanese?

15:29.440 --> 15:30.640
Like this one?

15:31.880 --> 15:34.908
- Yeah, that's it. Is that the dead man?
- Could you describe him?

15:34.960 --> 15:35.800
Uh...

15:35.800 --> 15:38.375
Taller than me. Broader.
Looked like he worked out.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.720
Do men often come in here
looking for Stephen?

15:41.340 --> 15:42.992
Stephen's not like me.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.520
He's older, for a start.
He still likes the scene.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.180
- He's always swiping right.
- How does that make you feel?

15:48.560 --> 15:51.560
I knew what he was like when I met
him, but meeting randoms...

15:52.100 --> 15:53.560
I've been attacked before,

15:53.560 --> 15:55.360
and last year,
someone was nearly killed.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.605
- And yet Stephen still does it?
- I don't know.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.960
We've not been together long,
and he's so secretive.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.480
- Never tells me anything.
- That can't be easy.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.060
I found this.

16:09.220 --> 16:12.440
Stephen sometimes lets people
rent the holiday apartments

16:12.440 --> 16:15.575
without telling the owners.
The business isn't doing too well.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.160
- Stephen sublets the flats for cash?
- Yeah.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.880
And I found this for last week.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.000
MK. Apartment 3.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.400
Look, I don't want
to get Stephen in trouble.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.735
- Do you know who MK is?
- No.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.600
Sir, MK was booked into
apartment 3 last Thursday.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.760
Thanks for this.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.880
- You lied to me.
- No. I'm not police.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.420
We just need to know if you
recognise any of these tattoos.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.580
Bex, please...

18:09.180 --> 18:10.380
It's MK.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.940
It's the phoenix.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.160
It was the first one he had done.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.300
I'm sorry I misled you, Bex.
It wasn't my intention.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.020
We believe that MK's been murdered,

18:22.420 --> 18:24.780
and we need you to help us
with the investigation.

18:28.995 --> 18:31.920
I've known MK since we were kids.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.620
He was adopted.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.380
I don't know what his real parents
ever did to him but...

18:40.860 --> 18:44.260
sometimes you could really see
the little boy reaching out.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.140
He ran away all the time.

18:47.860 --> 18:52.340
And when he was younger, of course, he
was always brought back, but then...

18:52.418 --> 18:53.980
Is that when he got into drugs?

18:55.900 --> 18:58.580
It was like he was trying to
erase everything.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.780
His past, his memories.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.620
He would just... disappear.

19:07.123 --> 19:09.400
One night, he died.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.820
His heart stopped beating
in the back of a taxi.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.840
The hospital managed to bring him
back.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.120
Hence the phoenix.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.360
He said it was like he'd been given
a second chance,

19:22.860 --> 19:25.980
which is why he wanted that tattoo.

19:27.220 --> 19:29.920
And it's how he
met an Irezumi Master

19:29.920 --> 19:32.000
who inspired him to change his life.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.520
Devote it to Irezumi.

19:37.580 --> 19:39.740
He's always been an amazing artist.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.860
Do you know who this man might be?

19:56.860 --> 20:00.340
Yeah. MK went to college with him.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.420
Steve something.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.000
- You sure?
- Yeah. I never liked him.

20:05.380 --> 20:08.140
When MK came to Brighton,
he used to stay with him.

20:08.140 --> 20:13.220
He was into all sorts of shit:
poppers, ketamine, coke.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.600
Has he got something to do
with MK's murder?

20:17.820 --> 20:19.100
We don't know.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.620
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

20:22.620 --> 20:24.460
I haven't seen him for years.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.300
Is this MK?

20:27.871 --> 20:28.991
Yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.360
He was here a couple of weeks ago
working on an Irezumi.

20:35.480 --> 20:40.415
If you could get us some names and
contact details for anyone he knew...

20:40.440 --> 20:42.760
clients, people from his past.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.960
People like Stephen,
who had history with him.

20:55.501 --> 20:58.181
- Blood pressure?
- 150 over 90.

21:08.157 --> 21:11.397
- Did dermatology come and see her?
- We're waiting on the results.

21:11.397 --> 21:13.157
We need another access line.

21:13.157 --> 21:14.917
Let's get some fluid running quickly.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.580
I've spoken to your parents, Akito.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.900
No, I told you...

21:21.900 --> 21:24.180
They were surprised
you'd been delivering pizzas

21:24.420 --> 21:27.260
and that you'd got yourself involved
in selling drugs.

21:29.300 --> 21:32.135
I lost all the money they gave me
for college.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.760
OK? Gambling.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.080
I had no choice.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.760
Can you describe the man
who attacked you?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.980
I don't know. It was dark.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.360
He pushed me down to the ground,

21:42.360 --> 21:43.840
and then I ran.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.920
I saw him ride away,

21:45.920 --> 21:47.720
he had my crash helmet on.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.120
He was wearing shorts.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.920
- Shorts?
- Yes. I... I think so.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.040
We're investigating a double murder.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.615
- SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE
- In English!

21:57.640 --> 21:59.880
I did not murder anyone.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.480
Please believe me.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.440
What really happened?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.480
Last Thursday night,

22:14.300 --> 22:15.780
I went down to the marina.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.775
The man I buy the
prescription drugs from,

22:19.800 --> 22:21.560
he called me to come down.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.360
He had a package for me.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.400
I parked my moped so the
cameras could not see me

22:28.400 --> 22:29.680
and I went to the boat,

22:29.680 --> 22:32.720
but when I got back to my bike,
the man attacked me.

22:45.180 --> 22:48.660
He took my bike, the helmet,
the package...

22:49.140 --> 22:51.575
I thought you were going to
tell us the truth, Akito.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.920
SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

22:53.920 --> 22:55.680
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:55.680 --> 22:58.120
Sir, you need to see this.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.220
Detective Sergeant Holden
has come in.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.900
Interview stopped at 14.03.

23:12.020 --> 23:15.420
The remains of a Sea View Pizza
crash helmet...

23:15.420 --> 23:18.600
with camera, though I'm not sure

23:18.600 --> 23:20.320
- you'll get any images from it.
- No.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.480
Max might be able to.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.800
- Good idea.
- All right.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.300
Have you not done it yet?

23:36.700 --> 23:38.340
Patience is a virtue, my love.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.700
It's corrupt.

23:45.295 --> 23:46.460
Great.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.820
Hang on. Hold on!

23:53.100 --> 23:57.300
Look, there's some fragments of
photos, videos...

23:57.300 --> 24:00.020
OK... GPS metadata.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.880
That's Akito's moped at the marina.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.760
Jack...

24:09.740 --> 24:11.692
Jack? Clarissa?

24:11.920 --> 24:17.920
On the CCTV images, Akito is carrying
the pizza box away from the boat.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.495
<i>And from the clips we've salvaged
from the helmet cam,</i>

24:20.520 --> 24:22.920
<i>she hides her bike by the dry dock.</i>

24:22.920 --> 24:24.320
OK, thanks.

24:27.460 --> 24:31.055
This is where Akito parked her moped,

24:31.080 --> 24:33.720
away from CCTV cameras.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.460
Now look at this.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.797
It's from the camera
on Akito's crash helmet.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.260
Turns out she was telling the truth.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.580
From prescription drugs to cocaine?

24:46.380 --> 24:48.224
Cocaine that was then stolen.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.960
Could that have been the
drug dealers attacking her?

24:50.960 --> 24:54.255
According to Clarissa, on the CCTV,
no-one comes out of the boat

24:54.280 --> 24:56.300
to follow Akito, but watch this.

24:56.940 --> 25:01.500
He's running up here towards Akito.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.660
So, who is that?

25:08.020 --> 25:11.460
The last signal taken from Stephen's
phone was from here in the marina,

25:11.460 --> 25:13.340
just minutes before Akito was attacked.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.486
BLADE RASPS

25:21.003 --> 25:24.083
That noise goes right through
the building.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.400
OK, so there's no DNA or trace
evidence on the saw, but...

25:31.480 --> 25:33.720
judging by these kerf marks,

25:33.920 --> 25:37.760
either this saw or a saw exactly
like it was used

25:37.760 --> 25:39.480
to dismember MK's body.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.160
Now, the second body,
as far as I can tell,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.680
was dismembered both by the lorry
that took it to the recycling centre

25:46.680 --> 25:48.520
and the machinery at the centre itself.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.120
Lab's confirmed that both men's DNA
is on the knife.

25:57.100 --> 26:01.120
So, what have we got? Two men
stabbed by exactly same knife,

26:01.120 --> 26:03.120
dumped into bins 50 metres apart
in the same street.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.000
Well, we also have a possible killer.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.640
The blood spatters
on the second man's shirt -

26:07.640 --> 26:09.680
they belong to Stephen Fraser.

26:54.297 --> 26:56.377
Was this the man
who came into the office

26:56.377 --> 26:58.945
- looking for Stephen?
- Yes. Have you found him?

26:59.200 --> 27:03.080
Blood found on this man's shirt
matches Stephen's DNA.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.660
- Do you know this man, Andrew?
- No.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.720
Just that he came into the office.

27:10.660 --> 27:14.160
Stephen knows lots of men,
old friends, exes.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.360
Brighton seems to be full of them.

27:17.820 --> 27:20.500
And what about this man?

27:25.267 --> 27:29.649
I've seen his photo. He's a friend
of Stephen's from years ago.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.440
Is this MK?

27:31.440 --> 27:32.600
So you do know him?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.020
No. I've never met him.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.400
Stephen likes to keep
his past to himself.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.500
This is the diary we found
in Stephen's desk.

27:42.340 --> 27:44.920
This is your handwriting,
isn't it, Andrew?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.360
We had it analysed.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.360
- The writing in this diary...
- Is mine, yes.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.720
And I put it into Stephen's desk

27:51.720 --> 27:53.520
because why should I
take the blame for it?

27:53.980 --> 27:55.440
It wasn't me taking the cash.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.880
- Perverting the course of justice...
- No!

27:57.880 --> 28:00.160
Look, I just panicked.

28:00.615 --> 28:04.575
And did Stephen make you change all
the invoices and the payment details?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.520
And the e-mails to the owners,
lying about...?

28:06.520 --> 28:07.620
I did it for Stephen.

28:08.259 --> 28:09.819
For the business.

28:11.752 --> 28:13.672
I wanted to feel important to him.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.180
When did you last see Stephen?

28:20.620 --> 28:23.040
A few days ago, he called me.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.400
Instead of going out as we'd planned
for my birthday,

28:25.400 --> 28:28.280
he was meeting yet another old
friend on his boat,

28:28.280 --> 28:31.000
but when I asked who it was
and why hadn't I been invited,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.040
he just told me to grow up.
I'm sick of it.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.080
Who was he meeting, Andrew?

28:37.020 --> 28:38.000
I don't know.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.420
What was the name of the boat?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.500
I don't know.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.520
WATER RUNS

29:18.440 --> 29:21.040
HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

29:41.270 --> 29:42.320
Mum?

29:42.320 --> 29:43.400
Yeah?

29:43.580 --> 29:45.100
There's a bag.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.700
Cherry blossom falls...

31:14.700 --> 31:17.020
scattered by the four great winds.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.860
Life is but fleeting.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.840
Mark Kenneth Blakewood,

31:31.040 --> 31:33.040
better known as MK.

31:33.040 --> 31:37.720
MK flew into Gatwick from Tokyo
on Thursday morning.

31:37.720 --> 31:41.160
We know apartment 3 was booked for
MK that night.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.320
We also believe MK's
dismembered body

31:43.320 --> 31:46.095
was picked up by a dustbin lorry
on the Friday morning.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.360
Anything more on the Ford van
that collided with the moped?

31:48.360 --> 31:52.855
We're checking CCTV. There was some
blue paint on the moped lights,

31:52.880 --> 31:54.160
possible transference.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.640
We'll need more than that
if we're ever going to identify it.

31:56.640 --> 32:00.448
These are postmortem photographs
of the second body we've found.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.240
- That has yet to be identified.
- Have we found it all yet?

32:04.240 --> 32:06.960
No. Some of it's still missing.
Maybe we'll never find them.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.000
Yeah. Neither his fingerprints nor
his DNA are on either database.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.160
And nothing from Missing Persons,

32:12.160 --> 32:14.080
though we know a man
matching his description

32:14.080 --> 32:16.680
walked into the Fraser Property
Agency looking for Stephen

32:16.680 --> 32:17.920
on Thursday afternoon.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.920
Stephens's business
is on the verge of bankruptcy.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.495
As well as fraudulently
renting out apartments,

32:23.520 --> 32:26.680
there's also evidence of
money-laundering and false accounting.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.655
Did Stephen invite MK over here in order

32:29.680 --> 32:33.560
to conduct some kind of lucrative drug
deal that then went horribly wrong?

32:33.560 --> 32:37.775
Another line of enquiry is Stephen's
boyfriend Andrew who, two years ago,

32:37.800 --> 32:39.920
was cautioned for
stalking an ex-boyfriend.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.400
He knew MK was coming to Brighton,
he has access to the apartments.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.640
A blue Ford van!

32:49.840 --> 32:52.280
Registration...

32:52.280 --> 32:53.800
is a...

32:54.920 --> 32:58.240
2006. You think it could be the
same one?

32:59.960 --> 33:02.126
- What are you doing?
- Just keep going.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.501
- SHE LAUGHS
- Are you ready?

33:04.501 --> 33:05.440
OK.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.340
Surprise.

33:10.980 --> 33:14.300
It's a new cot.
The one you said you wanted.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.720
We can't afford this.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.040
Oh, well...

33:17.515 --> 33:18.960
Someone owed me some money.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.820
This is so amazing.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.940
Mick?

33:34.380 --> 33:35.740
Mick?

33:41.160 --> 33:43.880
Where were you last Thursday night,
early Friday morning?

33:44.380 --> 33:45.820
I was out with some mates.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.340
Ally had the baby.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.660
A baby girl. Ruby.

33:50.740 --> 33:54.460
We have witnesses who say they saw
your van parked in Church Street.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.320
He wasn't in Church Street.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.040
He broke down outside the club.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.520
Is that what he told you?

33:59.720 --> 34:01.120
Come on. Let's go.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.560
What's happening now?

34:02.560 --> 34:04.440
We need to make a
search of the house.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.280
Mick's not done anything.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.719
You can search all day long
and you won't find nothing.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.719
TARAMELLI: Did you get these done locally?

34:53.520 --> 34:54.219
No comment.

34:54.219 --> 34:57.937
- Can you remember the name of the
tattooist who did them? - No comment.

34:58.120 --> 35:02.200
We have CCTV images of you
leaving at 3:04 am.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.760
Does that sound about right?

35:05.760 --> 35:07.000
No comment.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.080
We have a witness who said
your van was double parked

35:10.080 --> 35:13.480
in Church Street at around 3:30 am.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.920
No comment.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.775
You received six messages and four
phone calls from your partner Ally

35:30.800 --> 35:34.880
between 3:36 am and 4:52 am,

35:34.880 --> 35:38.540
but no phone calls or messages
from your phone.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.080
No comment.

35:54.852 --> 35:59.015
We found this knife...
at a recycling centre

35:59.040 --> 36:00.720
where a second body was discovered.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.220
Your fingerprints are on the handle.

36:12.006 --> 36:14.846
- I ask you again...
- I can tell you what happened.

36:16.120 --> 36:18.800
I saw the knife lying in the road,
and I thought it looked dangerous

36:18.800 --> 36:20.280
so I threw it in a bin.

36:34.587 --> 36:38.600
The piece of blood-soaked cloth
I found at the recycling depot...

36:38.840 --> 36:41.080
Are you going to ask me if I
examined it?

36:41.080 --> 36:44.095
Well, I do wonder what it is
you do all day.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.280
It matched the dead man's blood,

36:46.280 --> 36:50.840
but the cloth also contained oil
paint, turpentine, white spirit.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.080
And the bin liner?

36:52.080 --> 36:54.175
It too matched the
blood of the dead man,

36:54.200 --> 36:55.520
so too his fingerprints.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.280
What about the striation marks?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.091
Well, they didn't match
any of the bin liners

36:59.091 --> 37:01.655
found with the body parts in them,
and until we find

37:01.680 --> 37:04.420
the roll from which it came,
there's very little point...

37:06.680 --> 37:09.975
You're now going to tell me
you've found a roll of bin liners,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.940
and you're holding them
in an evidence bag.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.480
SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

37:15.480 --> 37:17.340
Do you recognise these, Mick?

37:18.433 --> 37:19.520
No comment.

37:19.960 --> 37:23.840
I didn't know this, but bin liners
have unique striation marks,

37:23.840 --> 37:27.880
from the machine that makes them and we
found a bin liner with a man's blood on it.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.540
These striation marks match exactly.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.380
A bin liner?

37:34.900 --> 37:36.560
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Are you serious?

37:36.560 --> 37:38.040
I'm as surprised as you are.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.760
But we know you were there, Mick.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.520
We've spoken to your ex, Keryn.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.920
You drove her home.
Your fingerprints are on the knife.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.040
And the bin liner covered with
the dead man's blood

37:47.040 --> 37:49.960
matches bin liners
found in the back of your van.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.680
On the Thursday night, I went out
with some mates to a club.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.060
Some bloke on a moped drove into me.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.940
I got out to have a look.
I could see that it was bad.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.420
He had a knife in his stomach.
There was a lot of blood.

38:22.660 --> 38:26.420
So I helped him into the back of the van.
I knew I was well over the limit,

38:26.420 --> 38:29.260
so I thought I could get him
to the hospital myself.

38:30.616 --> 38:33.160
Then the van wouldn't start...

38:33.900 --> 38:35.980
- Come on!
- ENGINE TURNS OVER

38:39.620 --> 38:41.880
- Fuck!
- PHONE RINGS

38:45.860 --> 38:47.140
Ally?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.400
MAN STRAINS AND GROANS

38:51.400 --> 38:52.860
I'll be right there, love.

38:54.820 --> 38:57.980
I asked the bloke in the back
if he knew someone I could call

38:57.980 --> 38:59.840
- to help him get to hospital but...
- Did you ask his name?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.560
He... he wasn't making much sense.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.080
MAN GASPS

39:03.080 --> 39:05.280
Come on, wake up!

39:07.560 --> 39:09.040
Oh, shit.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.480
Oh, shit!

39:11.480 --> 39:13.760
- And then you dumped him in a bin?
- I thought he was dead.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.720
He was covered in blood.
What else could I do?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.880
Call the police, call an ambulance.
You might have saved his life, Mick.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.240
I had to get home. Ally was having
our baby. I promised her.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.760
I thought you said your van
had broken down.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.280
I thought it had, but then...
I'd just stalled it,

39:25.280 --> 39:28.200
then I couldn't get it started. I panicked.
I just had to get home.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.740
My baby girl...

39:33.140 --> 39:37.060
You've told us about one dead man, Mick.
Now tell us about the other man.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.855
After you left the nightclub,
where did you go?

39:40.880 --> 39:42.720
I-I've told you what happened.

39:42.720 --> 39:46.535
Another man was murdered on the same
night, just 50 metres away.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.680
He, too, was stuffed into a rubbish bin.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.840
We know there was no activity
on your phone for over 90 minutes.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.880
What were you doing in Church Street
for an hour-and-a-half?

39:55.140 --> 39:56.420
I was with Keryn.

39:56.420 --> 39:59.095
She told us you just drove
her home and then left...

39:59.120 --> 40:02.960
No. No, she's just telling you that
because I told her not to say anything.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.480
I was with her... you know?

40:07.920 --> 40:11.680
You were with Keryn while Ally was
giving birth to your baby?

40:11.680 --> 40:13.920
It should never have happened.
None of it should.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.964
It's like I suddenly woke up,

40:18.240 --> 40:20.000
and Ally was having the baby.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I was going to be a dad
and I just knew,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.980
in that moment, I had to change.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.340
I just had to be there.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.460
That's why I had to get rid of him.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.060
SOFTLY: I'm sorry.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.720
Clarissa Mullery, I presume.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.480
What are you doing here?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.260
I was looking for my wife.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.680
We were meant to be having dinner.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.800
You get a piece of evidence...

41:21.460 --> 41:23.280
A key piece of evidence?

41:24.180 --> 41:26.620
And can you find where it fits?

41:26.980 --> 41:31.820
Why don't car manufacturers just list
the keys that fit into their cars?

41:38.700 --> 41:40.940
Do you ever regret not having children?

41:44.560 --> 41:45.640
No.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.260
In all the years we've been married?

41:49.240 --> 41:51.700
I'd understand if you did.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.760
Do you?

41:56.140 --> 41:59.100
It's never been an option for me.
It has for you.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.440
Falling in love with you, Clarissa,

42:03.440 --> 42:05.080
was never an option.

42:07.380 --> 42:09.100
Je ne regrette rien?

42:10.420 --> 42:13.220
Or as they say in Japanese,
koukai nande shinai?

42:16.940 --> 42:18.420
Ai shiteru.

42:27.580 --> 42:30.180
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER OUTSIDE

42:33.940 --> 42:35.740
MUFFLED: Hey!

43:10.058 --> 43:11.860
You're looking at me again.

43:13.900 --> 43:16.140
You're here. In my kitchen.

43:16.620 --> 43:18.020
In the middle of the night.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.580
Are you all right?

43:24.500 --> 43:25.680
Matt...

43:26.300 --> 43:29.700
if I got pregnant, is that
something that you would be...

43:30.580 --> 43:31.760
happy with...?

43:32.800 --> 43:34.680
Are you... pregnant?

43:35.160 --> 43:36.160
No.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.940
No. I'm not.

43:40.540 --> 43:43.620
You thought you were,
and you're disappointed.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.400
It's not something I've ever
thought about before,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.080
and now I can't stop
thinking about it.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.880
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

43:54.240 --> 43:57.320
Because you have two beautiful children,

43:57.320 --> 43:59.720
who are both doing
brilliantly at college,

43:59.720 --> 44:01.760
and you're on the brink of
this amazing career...

44:01.760 --> 44:05.000
No, I have a beautiful girlfriend,
who's brilliant at her job,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.200
and I was the brink
of an amazing weekend.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.600
Yes, you are.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.640
But seriously, I mean,

44:12.640 --> 44:15.360
why would you want to be
encumbered with a new family?

44:15.360 --> 44:16.680
Encumbered with?

44:16.680 --> 44:18.760
There's nothing that you
and I can ever do

44:18.760 --> 44:21.680
that would ever make
me feel "encumbered."

44:23.760 --> 44:27.320
- What, so if I were to get pregnant...
- Mm-hm.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.640
I mean, I don't even know if I can.

44:29.640 --> 44:32.320
I know I'm much better at dealing
with people at the end of their lives

44:32.320 --> 44:34.480
- than at the beginning of their lives.
- What about dealing with

44:34.480 --> 44:37.080
the middle-aged man that's
in your kitchen?

44:38.955 --> 44:40.280
I can deal with it.

44:40.280 --> 44:44.900
Listen. If it happens, that's great.
And if it doesn't...

44:47.580 --> 44:49.500
NIKKI LAUGHS

44:56.575 --> 44:59.200
The police are convinced the man
they have in custody,

44:59.200 --> 45:01.080
- Mick... What's his name?
- Knight.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.080
Yeah, Mick Knight.
They're convinced he killed both men.

45:04.080 --> 45:07.280
At the moment, he's admitting being
involved in the death of the second man,

45:07.280 --> 45:09.520
- but not MK.
- What do they think happened?

45:09.520 --> 45:11.560
They think Mick was in Church Street

45:11.560 --> 45:13.600
when he saw MK going into
the holiday apartments.

45:14.081 --> 45:16.281
They both have a history of drugs, so...

45:16.281 --> 45:19.400
According to Bex, MK has
nothing to do with drugs any more.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.812
Well, the police believe
Mick went into the apartments

45:23.000 --> 45:25.240
either to confront MK about something

45:25.240 --> 45:28.880
or to take advantage of an ongoing drugs
deal, possibly set up by Stephen Fraser.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.535
Mick then drove off in his van

45:30.560 --> 45:32.680
and it was then that he collided
with a moped rider.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.775
The moped stolen from Akito?

45:34.800 --> 45:36.160
Yeah. They want us to go back over

45:36.160 --> 45:39.480
- all the evidence we've got and see
if we missed anything. - The keys.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.880
I've exhausted every car make,

45:41.880 --> 45:45.000
so I now believe this key
belongs to a boat.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.440
Message from DS Quicke.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.240
Client of MK's in hospital with sepsis.

45:51.440 --> 45:55.080
QUICKE: We put an alert out
on MK's friends and clients.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.520
Carola Brewster,
she went to MK for a tattoo

45:58.520 --> 46:00.400
and was taken ill nine days ago.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.320
BEEPING

46:02.320 --> 46:04.940
Detective? She's stopped breathing.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.220
Shocking.

46:25.430 --> 46:28.630
I'm ready to call it.
Anyone disagree?

47:19.080 --> 47:20.560
I thought you lot were finished.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.580
I'm sorry, Mrs Knight, we're going
to have to search the house again.

47:34.580 --> 47:37.259
Certainly looks like it could be
the work of MK.

47:37.400 --> 47:41.273
Every time the needles of the tebori
or any needle goes into the skin,

47:41.273 --> 47:46.393
it's ostensibly opening a wound,
a pathway for germs to enter the body.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.620
I think this will be the cause
of the sepsis.

47:49.620 --> 47:52.500
CLARISSA: What's her name?
QUICKE: Carola Brewster.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.820
The blood's been infected
throughout the body...

47:56.060 --> 47:58.580
causing catastrophic organ failure.

47:58.580 --> 48:02.540
The hospital thought she might have been
poisoned by the inks used for the tattoo.

48:12.660 --> 48:13.540
Jack!

48:19.220 --> 48:22.000
What have you got?
Thank you.

48:24.540 --> 48:25.940
Detective Inspector?

48:29.171 --> 48:30.811
What are you doing?

48:38.220 --> 48:41.740
This has been identified
as MK's blood.

48:42.400 --> 48:45.820
Can you explain how it got onto
your baby's blanket?

48:49.220 --> 48:50.700
I got rid of it all.

48:52.740 --> 48:54.020
Burned it.

48:55.180 --> 48:58.320
- What are you...?
- Give us a map, I'll show you.

49:07.700 --> 49:09.660
WATER RUNS

49:11.860 --> 49:13.220
HE CALLS OUT WEAKLY

49:19.480 --> 49:20.600
HE COUGHS

49:20.600 --> 49:21.840
Help me!

49:21.840 --> 49:23.120
Help!

49:27.400 --> 49:28.980
Help me!

49:29.740 --> 49:33.640
We found where you'd burned MK's
passport, the bloodied groundsheet,

49:33.640 --> 49:35.480
the remnants of Japanese tebori.

49:35.480 --> 49:40.340
What I don't understand, Mick, is why
you didn't tell us about these hands.

49:44.060 --> 49:47.340
There was all this stuff
in the back of the moped.

49:50.540 --> 49:52.420
Jack's found some burned hands.

49:52.860 --> 49:54.420
Belonging to MK?

49:54.420 --> 49:55.940
I'll take samples.

49:55.965 --> 49:59.620
Hopefully we'll also get some base
evidence from underneath the fingernails.

50:01.020 --> 50:04.620
The images from the camera were
badly corrupted,

50:04.620 --> 50:07.000
but Max found an MP4 file

50:07.000 --> 50:10.040
and managed to extract the GPS
metadata

50:10.040 --> 50:11.760
gyroscope, accelerometer,

50:11.760 --> 50:16.000
temperature, timestamps
and, crucially, co-ordinates.

50:23.040 --> 50:28.815
The moped leaves the marina at 9:16,
travels through Brighton,

50:28.840 --> 50:34.920
finally arriving outside the Church
Street holiday apartments at 9:29.

51:07.826 --> 51:10.740
DNA underneath MK's fingernails...

51:12.100 --> 51:14.580
belongs to the second dead man.

51:16.660 --> 51:19.925
Having murdered and dismembered MK,

51:20.320 --> 51:21.960
he came out of the apartment

51:21.960 --> 51:25.673
and got onto the moped he'd stolen
earlier that night from Akito.

51:25.760 --> 51:28.840
He then crashed into the blue van
driven by Mick Knight

51:28.840 --> 51:31.480
and impaled himself on the knife
he was carrying.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.420
Guy Brewster.

51:33.445 --> 51:37.135
Six weeks ago,
Guy's wife Carola went to MK

51:37.160 --> 51:38.720
to have a matching tattoo done.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.600
Bex said it was to celebrate
their new adventure...

51:41.600 --> 51:43.520
travelling around the world
in their boat.

51:43.520 --> 51:48.775
But the tattoo got infected. Looks like
Guy blamed MK and the inks he used.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.260
So where does Stephen
fit into all of this?

52:23.069 --> 52:25.629
- Carola's Dream.
- Hmm?

52:26.060 --> 52:28.380
That's what the Japanese
characters mean.

52:28.700 --> 52:30.580
Carola's Dream.

52:35.340 --> 52:36.700
Stephen!

52:42.730 --> 52:44.060
Stephen?

52:45.471 --> 52:46.800
We'll take it from here.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.900
OK...

52:54.340 --> 52:56.800
Turns out Stephen was
telling Andrew the truth.

52:57.610 --> 52:59.530
He came here to meet an old friend.

53:03.090 --> 53:04.340
Guy Brewster.

53:11.506 --> 53:14.346
Carola's as good as dead,
and it's all his fault!

53:14.346 --> 53:15.906
Tell me where MK is!

53:18.026 --> 53:19.426
OK! OK!

53:25.379 --> 53:29.495
MUFFLED: What are you doing?
Where are you going?

53:29.520 --> 53:31.200
CLARISSA: Guy went to see Stephen,

53:31.200 --> 53:34.120
believing MK was responsible for
Carola's sepsis.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.375
He assumed Stephen
would know where he was.

53:36.400 --> 53:41.000
Guy leaves Stephen tied up
and heads out to confront MK.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.335
He then sees Akito getting on her
moped, shoves her aside

53:45.360 --> 53:47.020
and steals it.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.760
He then kills MK,
and after disposing of the body,

53:52.760 --> 53:54.900
collides with Mick's van.

53:57.520 --> 54:00.560
Guy blamed MK
for destroying their dream.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.080
He must have been out of his mind
to do what he did.

54:03.080 --> 54:06.040
Yeah. Before he was unceremoniously
dumped into a bin

54:06.460 --> 54:09.080
and then himself dismembered
by the recycling process.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.660
Oh, my God.

54:11.940 --> 54:13.180
What is it?

54:17.197 --> 54:20.040
- Guy was wrong.
- Wrong? What do you mean?

54:20.040 --> 54:22.480
Results are back
from the microbiology lab.

54:24.500 --> 54:27.540
It wasn't MK's inks
that infected Carola.

54:31.500 --> 54:34.109
It was Vibrio vulnificus.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.760
The seaborne bacteria?

54:35.785 --> 54:36.940
Yeah.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.940
We know Carola loved water.

54:41.740 --> 54:45.540
She must have gone swimming in the
sea or a lake or river.

54:46.024 --> 54:47.760
Surely someone must have told her

54:47.760 --> 54:50.320
not to go swimming so soon after
having the tattoos done.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.320
Can I speak to Hannah Quicke, please?

55:22.340 --> 55:26.540
What did you think when Kelly got
a tattoo? Were you cross?

55:29.220 --> 55:31.535
I wasn't cross.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.720
It's her body. She can do what she
wants, it's just...

55:34.720 --> 55:37.020
Don't like it when she does
what she wants?

55:39.292 --> 55:41.380
Being a parent is...

55:44.140 --> 55:46.720
- What?
- Well, it's not easy.

55:47.700 --> 55:49.560
Maybe you'll find out one day.

55:51.700 --> 55:52.940
How?

55:58.980 --> 56:00.400
I love you.

56:00.498 --> 56:02.178
I love you too.

56:20.022 --> 56:24.142
It's 20 years.
Orders have disappeared.

56:24.142 --> 56:25.982
Everyone, including me,

56:25.982 --> 56:29.180
has been so busy just getting on.

56:29.622 --> 56:31.462
Any idea why your father would run?

56:31.462 --> 56:34.520
He's confused.
He wants to forget the past.

56:35.182 --> 56:36.822
Forget the dead.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.751
How old would she be now?

56:38.776 --> 56:41.200
She was, what,
eight years younger than you?

56:41.456 --> 56:42.920
Any idea what it is yet?

56:43.740 --> 56:47.615
It's a recurring feature of handmade IEDs.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.600
Orla! Do you think it's possible
it might be active again?

56:50.600 --> 56:52.920
If the killing starts,
there's nothing you can do about it.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.480
You can only stay out of the way.

56:54.480 --> 56:55.855
Just leave it alone!

56:55.880 --> 56:57.000
HE GRUNTS

56:57.000 --> 56:58.160
Orla!

56:59.305 --> 57:05.459
