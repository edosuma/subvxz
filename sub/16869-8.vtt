we end up up the creek.

-That would be heat vision.

Wally's not like me,
he doesn't want his powers gone.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.129
We're gonna have a hard time
convincing him not to use them.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.721
Yeah, well, we have to until he's ready.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.367
-(LAUGHING) How?
-By convincing him that he isn't.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.725
That means no encouraging him,
no training him,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.001
and,you,

01:29.040 --> 01:30.405
no talking to him about his suit.

the mysterious object that crashed

04:57.040 --> 04:58.724

04:58.960 --> 05:03.249
was simply a DOD aircraft

Thank you,

- What else did you see?
-Enough to give Ridley Scott nightmares.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.924

05:44.600 --> 05:45.931
Both. Sort of.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.924

we've been calling them the Dominators.

No, no, it, it's very aggressive.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.044
So, how long have you guys known
about these "Dominators?"

05:57.280 --> 05:59.362
- Since the '50s.
-That was them.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.722

06:02.520 --> 06:03.965
What? I watch SyFy channel.

06:04.920 --> 06:08.561
In 1951, they appeared
under the same sort of circumstances.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.201
A ship crash landed,
little to no communication.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.643
We learned they were abducting humans
to gather intel about us.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.485
<i>They attacked, and hundreds of soldiers
lost their lives.</i>

06:17.640 --> 06:20.211
Then for some inexplicable reason,
they left.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.206
All contact had been lost,

06:22.440 --> 06:25.125
until three months ago
when the DOD received this.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.963

06:40.160 --> 06:43.482
<i>will prompt swift retaliation.</i>

06:43.840 --> 06:46.844
So, when we discovered four ships
heading towards Earth,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.765
we were concerned
that it was happening all over again.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.686
One of them, obviously, landed here.

06:52.840 --> 06:56.526
Right. 'Cause we ain't got enough crazy
going on here in Central City.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.649
- Do you know what they want?
-They've ignored all attempts

06:58.840 --> 07:01.161
to communicate,
but we do know, just like before,

07:01.320 --> 07:03.084
that the dropships
contained reconnaissance teams

07:03.280 --> 07:04.964
sent here to gather more intel about us.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.525
Looking for our weaknesses?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.768
- We need to do something.
-LYLA: We are.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.368
Nearly every member state in the UN
is in talks to coordinate a response.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.522
- Action is being taken.
-So, wait,

07:14.680 --> 07:16.125
you want us to just sit this one out?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.322
These things are like World WarZ zombies,

07:18.520 --> 07:21.046

no military can stop them.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.486
Neither could you.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.331
Not by yourself, anyway.

So, the plan isn't to just

07:38.200 --> 07:40.521
-stay still and do nothing, right?
-No.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.884

you can't do this alone.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.731

Aliens.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.405
I swear to God, Barry,

Hey, I know, I mean, I'm sorry.
Look, okay, they're real,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.647

and from what Lyla told us,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.291
it does not appear to be for peace.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.085
- Oh, no.
-Lyla knows about this?

09:10.320 --> 09:12.641

they should be here...

-Well, since we're fighting aliens,

promised to do the same for me?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.646
What are we up against?

11:34.640 --> 11:36.324
Team Arrow is here.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.485
Team Legends is here. Is that everyone?

11:39.760 --> 11:40.807
I think so?

11:40.960 --> 11:43.566
Nate and Amaya are back
watching The Waverider.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.286
The newbies.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.641
- That was cool.
- BARRY: <i>Guys!</i>

11:51.480 --> 11:52.811
- Thanks for coming.
-Barry, I thought

11:52.960 --> 11:55.122
-you were bringing an alien?
-And, yeah...

11:55.800 --> 11:57.768
We did. Everybody, this is

11:57.960 --> 11:59.769
my friend, Kara Danvers,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.486
or as she's known on her Earth, Supergirl.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.648
- What makes her so super?
-Well...

12:10.120 --> 12:11.121
I'm convinced.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.482
Best team-up ever!

12:20.160 --> 12:21.605
(SNARLING)

12:22.040 --> 12:23.007
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

12:38.800 --> 12:40.689
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
Okay, I think I have this.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.366
- Oliver?
-Green Arrow.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.726
- Digg.
-Spartan.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.485
- Thea.
-Speedy.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.166
Okay. And, Sara?

12:48.360 --> 12:50.966
- White Canary.
-Jax and Professor Stein?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.565
Firestorm.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.044
- Ray?
-Palmer, The Atom.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.691
And, Mick.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.046
Mmm?

12:58.240 --> 12:59.844
Oh, Heat Wave.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.525
Uh, and...

13:02.240 --> 13:04.049
Iris, Caitlin, and Felicity.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.401
Whoo! Yes!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.606
And, you, you have cold powers
but you can't use them?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.769
- You have powers?
-it's a long story.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.891
Uh, Barry, so,

13:13.040 --> 13:15.042
- Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow?
-Yeah.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.208
- Oh, my God, he just got so much hotter.
-Oh, my God.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.044
Okay, Cisco, we should probably
get started?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.206
Okay.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.251
These are the Dominators,

13:24.560 --> 13:27.370
-we don't know much about them...
-Except, they're really strong.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.566
I heard a lot of stories about them

13:30.760 --> 13:32.569
when I was a kid, they came to my planet

13:32.720 --> 13:36.850
before I was born, they did experiments
on a lot of people, killed a lot more.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.731
Well, they're not the only ones
with super-human strength, I hear.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.725
Barry says that you're more powerful
than a locomotive?

13:43.560 --> 13:45.449
We should use Kara
as a stand-in for training.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.768
Since when was Robin Hood
calling the shots?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.600
What, I think, Mick is trying to say is,

13:50.760 --> 13:53.650
it would be nice if we knew
who was in charge around here.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.206
Maybe we should take a vote,

13:55.400 --> 13:56.890
choose a leader. Someone we can all trust.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.445
Well, I trust Oliver.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.961
He's got my vote.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.644
Appreciate that, Cisco, but Barry
put us all together, it should be him.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.327
Fair enough.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.081
Okay, um...

14:09.320 --> 14:13.450
Cool, all right, well, I guess as
team leader, first thing to do

14:13.640 --> 14:15.927
is start out by, um...

14:17.280 --> 14:19.282
- Doing a test run.
-Let's do a test run, yeah.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.720
Let's do a test run.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.446
- Against Supergirl.
-Against Supergirl. All right?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.290
- Test run against Supergirl.
-Are we just supposed to

14:25.480 --> 14:28.450
-pretend like we don't hear him?
-So, just suit up.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.444
Okay? Look alive, we're training
to fight aliens,

14:30.640 --> 14:32.165
by fighting an alien, so...

14:32.960 --> 14:34.450
- Do it. Just suit up.
-Stop.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.126
What? Oliver, hey, Kara,

14:37.320 --> 14:40.483
um, really quick. I was excited about
the two of you guys meeting each other.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.688
Yeah, Oliver was the first person
to train me.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.490
- Really? Well...
-Yeah.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.921
-...you did a really good job.
-it's 'cause I didn't hold back,

14:47.280 --> 14:48.361
lshot him.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.966
You can't hold back either.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.164
He did shoot me.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.646
Ouch, ah...

14:53.840 --> 14:55.968
Okay. Um, are you sure about that?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.930
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
I just met these people.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.128
These people need to understand
this isn't gonna be easy.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.440
Don't hold back, especially against me.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.171
Yes, sir.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.286
- Did he not like me?
-No, he's

15:10.880 --> 15:13.360
like that with everyone, it's...
He'll warm up to you.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.207
Old West dwarf star plus replicator
equals new suit.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.841
You know what, Ray?
Maybe it's just me, but,

15:21.120 --> 15:22.724
I think this thing's due for an update.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.369
Ha! Yes, but after we
dominate the Dominators.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.684
Oh! I see what you did there.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.047
(CHUCKLES)

15:32.000 --> 15:33.161
Hey-

15:34.480 --> 15:37.689
Uh, listen, I gotta get to work,
Felicity is waiting for me,

15:38.040 --> 15:39.405
but we'll talk about this later.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.206
Hey, Barry.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.565
Uh, where's Snart?

15:43.880 --> 15:46.360
Oh, man, I'm sorry, Barry,

15:46.520 --> 15:48.648
I forgot that we never told you.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.886
What happened?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.005
He sacrificed himself,

15:53.400 --> 15:54.890
saved us all.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.562
- He died a hero.
-A "Legend."

16:01.680 --> 16:02.920
<i>IRIS: Wally, what are you doing here?</i>

16:03.320 --> 16:05.766
You can't just show up and think
you're gonna train with everyone else.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.048
- Why not?
-Because we need to test you more.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.249
H.R. said that my results were great,
he said I'm good to go.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.886
I don't care what H.R. said,
you are not ready.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.525
- I am ready.
-Wally,

16:15.720 --> 16:17.882
everyone here has been doing this
for a long time.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.242
And this is gonna be
the hardest challenge they've faced.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.288
Fighting Alchemy or Savitar, or aliens
isn't something you just show up and try.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.088
If you screw up, you could die.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.925
Do you get that?

16:31.080 --> 16:32.127
(WHOOSHING)

16:32.880 --> 16:33.881
Great.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.764
Satellite's not picking up
anything abnormal.

16:35.920 --> 16:36.921
No.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.407
I don't know if we're gonna find
any Dominators this way.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.810
Hey I, um...

16:42.120 --> 16:45.169
Just-- I couldn't help but notice
things are a little bit tense?

16:45.800 --> 16:48.644
You don't need to be able
to "vibe" to figure that out.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.281
Okay, so, apparently, it's, like, illegal

16:51.440 --> 16:53.090
to be mad at Barry, but guess what,

16:53.320 --> 16:55.607
he screws up just like the rest of us.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.371
Yeah, and when he does,
he feels bad like the rest of us, too.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.490
Felicity, he took it upon himself
to change the timeline.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.769
And because of it, my brother

17:05.119 --> 17:06.201
was killed.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.010
So, there's no amount of feeling bad
that could ever make up for that.

17:16.040 --> 17:19.169
Barry, before we start training
there's something you need to hear.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.364
A message, that would be better
if we could share with you in private.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.849
- All right, I'll step away.
-No, no, it's fine, you can stay.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.167
All right. But no one else.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.687
All right.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.846
Let's make it quick.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.208
<i>OLD BARRY:
A war is coming, Captain Hunter,</i>

17:39.480 --> 17:42.563
<i>and at some point, you're gonna be
called back to Central City to fight it.</i>

17:42.800 --> 17:44.643
<i>So you need to know
that while you and your team</i>

17:44.840 --> 17:45.887
<i>have been in the temporal zone,</i>

17:46.160 --> 17:48.162
<i>I made a choice
that affected the timeline.</i>

17:48.320 --> 17:50.527
<i>As you know, whenever you alter the past,</i>

17:50.720 --> 17:53.883
<i>those changes affect the present
and get compounded in the future.</i>

17:54.360 --> 17:57.170
<i>When you return, you will be
in the new timeline I created,</i>

17:57.360 --> 18:00.170
<i>where everyone's past and everyone's
future has been affected,</i>

18:00.360 --> 18:02.169
<i>including yours. When you come back,</i>

18:02.360 --> 18:04.328
<i>don't trust anything or anyone,</i>

18:04.560 --> 18:05.686
not even me.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.600
Where did you get that from?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.048
We found it in a secret room
inside The Waverider.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.004
It was sent by you, 40 years from now.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.410
Forty years from now? Barry,
what the hell does this mean?

18:20.680 --> 18:23.126
It means I screwed things up
when I changed the past.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.125
- What did you do?
-I went back in time and

18:27.080 --> 18:28.241
I saved my mom.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.568
I created a timeline where she's alive.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.725
It's called "Flashpoint,"
and I lived in it for a few months,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.409
until I realized
that I made a big mistake,

18:37.600 --> 18:39.523
and I tried to reset the timeline
to put things back

18:39.760 --> 18:41.364
to how they were supposed to be but...

18:41.520 --> 18:42.760
But it didn't Work?

18:43.800 --> 18:44.881
No.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.730
Wow, Barry, that's...

18:46.920 --> 18:49.605
So, what's changed since you did this?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.564
Cisco's brother is dead,

18:51.760 --> 18:53.046
Caitlin has powers,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.487
Diggle has a son now
instead of a daughter.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.609
What? John had a daughter?

18:59.080 --> 19:01.560
I didn't just screw up my life, man,
I screwed up everybody's lives,

19:01.720 --> 19:03.768
and apparently
everybody's lives in the future.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.889
I felt like, when these aliens got here,

19:06.120 --> 19:08.885
that finally something had happened
I didn't cause, and maybe I could make up

19:09.120 --> 19:11.407
for everything
I had done to everybody, but I...

19:11.760 --> 19:13.922
I think we should be on the up and up
with everybody.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.121
We gotta tell 'em.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.403
We're going up against a bunch of aliens,
and you wanna tell people

19:18.560 --> 19:20.767
that their lives might have been affected
by time travel?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.410
One sci-fi problem at a time.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.291
You made a mistake, Barry,

19:25.480 --> 19:26.641
<i>it's part of the job.</i>

19:27.240 --> 19:28.446
We can't deal with it today.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.650
Professor Stein, are you okay?

19:57.840 --> 19:58.887
MARTIN: I'm not sure.

20:00.840 --> 20:04.003
Ms. Snow, would you mind
accompanying me to my home?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.485
There's something I need to do.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.121
Sure.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.010
She really is a badass.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.849
Yeah, it's kinda hot.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.887
Let's go again.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.050
So this is what,
your way of advising me to do nothing?

20:39.240 --> 20:42.528
The Dominators have yet to engage
in an act of aggression, sir.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.881
What does A.R.G.U.S. think?

20:45.080 --> 20:48.084
I think us being passive is exactly
what they want, Mr. President.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.687
Well, finally, someone here with balls.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.601
Ike ignored all the signs
and waited until it was too late,

20:53.840 --> 20:55.524
I'm not gonna make that same mistake.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.371
You saw what happened
the last time we engaged them.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.530
That's a lot of casualties
to be remembered for.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.728
Four dropships landed on this planet,

21:03.920 --> 21:05.684
all of them sent to gather intel.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.848
If we do nothing and they attack,

21:08.760 --> 21:10.250
that's what I'll be remembered for.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.841
Proceed as instructed.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.128
(ENGINES STARTING)

21:23.560 --> 21:25.289
You know, Director Michaels,

21:26.200 --> 21:28.771
the reason that Amanda Waller
lasted as long as she did

21:28.960 --> 21:31.042
is because she learned
how to follow my lead.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.762
I suggest that you acquire that trait.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.406
Soon.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.928
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

21:51.880 --> 21:52.927
He's gone.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.927
Traveler has been taken. I repeat,
Traveler has been taken.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.765
The Dominators have the President.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.361
- Hey, son.
-I don't understand, Dad.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.163
No one in this family
wants me to have powers.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.768
You don't, Barry doesn't, even Iris.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.770
According to this,
everything is fine with me,

22:28.960 --> 22:30.803
in fact everything is better than fine.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.284
What, did you run back
to make sure I didn't see these?

22:36.280 --> 22:37.611
I'm faster than you now, remember?

22:38.160 --> 22:40.162
Whether you, or Barry,
or anyone likes it or not.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.967
Wally, look, I know
you're upset with me, I was,

22:43.160 --> 22:44.650
I was just trying to protect you.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.843
Come on,
I know you don't want me training,

22:47.040 --> 22:48.201
I just don't get why.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.529
Because I'm better than Barry was
when he first got his speed.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.006
You know, in Flashpoint,

22:53.200 --> 22:55.646
you and I were a brother-sister
crime fighting unit.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.841
So, it sucks you don't have
the same faith in me here

22:59.040 --> 23:00.121
as you did there.

-We're kinda treated the same way, right?

Yeah. What, what does that mean?

36:39.560 --> 36:40.607
He)'. Supergirl,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.964
let's finally see who's faster.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.201
(GUNFIRE)

36:58.320 --> 36:59.606
(PANTING)

37:19.160 --> 37:20.286
(YELLS)

37:39.480 --> 37:40.527
Too slow.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.328
- What is he doing?
-He's making her angry.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.964
But he knows Supergirl is invincible.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.009
I think maybe that's the point.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.048
(BOTH GRUNTING)

39:02.080 --> 39:04.003
(PANTING)

39:09.920 --> 39:11.445
Barry?

39:16.760 --> 39:17.841
(GRUNTS)

39:28.120 --> 39:29.360
Guys,

39:29.920 --> 39:31.206
they're back.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.726
What happened?

39:37.040 --> 39:40.123
You didn't kill me,
so my day is looking up.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.641
I'm so sorry, I...

39:41.880 --> 39:43.928
You're not the first superhero
to be mind-controlled.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.968
(SIGHS)

39:55.120 --> 39:58.567
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,
but I had to do something.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.401
_l'm__
-I'm glad you're okay.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.609
- Don't ever do that again.
-Ah!

40:04.800 --> 40:06.086
Sorry, not sorry.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.162
Come on, let's get you checked out.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.161
And then we can talk about
how dumb that was.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.685
Okay.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.681
- H.R.: Okay.
-(SIGHS)

40:19.760 --> 40:21.091
"Okay," what?

40:21.280 --> 40:25.251
They don't see your potential, I do.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.241
One of my many gifts.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.321
You wanna train?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.206
I'll train you.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.001
(CHUCKLES)

40:37.360 --> 40:39.840
So what's it like,
being all mind-controlled and stuff?

40:40.120 --> 40:42.805
I didn't realize
he had a mind to be controlled.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.770
<i>RAY". Barry, about before,</i>

40:47.440 --> 40:48.805
<i>message OT HO message,</i>

40:49.360 --> 40:51.442
-we're with you.
-Thank you.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.327
- So where's Supergirl?
-Scanning the city to make sure

40:54.520 --> 40:56.727
there aren't any more of the orbs
that whammied all of you.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.803
Okay. So now what?

40:59.200 --> 41:02.647
We call Lyla, tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.641
Sara!

41:14.240 --> 41:15.810
Everybody inside, go!

42:09.040 --> 42:10.041
