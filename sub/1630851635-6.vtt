00:17.434 --> 00:20.353
- They say even
the bravest wild cat hunts

00:20.395 --> 00:23.732
with their head down,
stalking its prey.

00:23.773 --> 00:28.278
Killing its quarry when they're
at their most vulnerable.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.779
Out there in the field
last night,

00:29.821 --> 00:33.033
our Wildcats didn't
just murder Dana Point,

00:33.074 --> 00:34.909
we slaughtered them!

00:34.951 --> 00:36.911
Whoo! Hey!

00:36.953 --> 00:40.206
[awkward murmuring]

00:40.248 --> 00:43.585
Too soon? Yeah, I--I get it.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.964
Well, uh,

00:48.006 --> 00:52.385
the last few weeks have been
a total nightmare, guys.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.513
But we will be
the disco mirror ball

00:55.555 --> 00:58.308
that shines the way forward.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.060
Who's ready to party? Hey!

01:00.101 --> 01:03.813
[crowd cheering]

01:03.855 --> 01:07.442
- * Who's gonna
save you now? *

01:07.484 --> 01:09.444
- Oh, and if you forgot to vote

01:09.486 --> 01:11.279
for our homecoming king
and queen, too late.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.781
The results are
being tallied right now.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.449
Thank you.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.242
- * Save you, save you, now? *

01:16.284 --> 01:18.536
* *

01:18.578 --> 01:20.580
* Who's gonna save you now? *

01:20.622 --> 01:22.916
* Given my benefit shot
even when *

01:22.957 --> 01:24.793
* *

01:24.834 --> 01:28.004
* They told me not to,
I said I've got to *

01:28.046 --> 01:30.173
- Hey, welcome back, TJ. Hi.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.094
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34.135 --> 01:37.430
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.517
Any word from Addy?
- Still nothing.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.727
- I know she's not
on squad anymore,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.146
but skipping the homecoming
game is not like her.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.107
I'm kind of worried.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.276
- Yeah.
I'll--I'll be right back.

01:50.318 --> 01:54.989
- * Who's gonna save
you now? *

01:55.031 --> 01:56.366
* I wish you well *

01:56.408 --> 01:58.326
* But go take it
somewhere else *

01:58.368 --> 02:03.415
* Oh, who's gonna save you,
save you, save you now? *

02:03.456 --> 02:05.625
- Again, why are we doing this?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.502
- Because mom and dad think
you looks a lot less

02:07.544 --> 02:09.629
like a murderer all dressed up
and smiling for the cameras.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.798
- They overestimate
the power of this dress.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.300
- B, do I really have to tell
you that it's your senior year?

02:14.342 --> 02:15.510
You don't want
a few good memories

02:15.552 --> 02:17.429
before the inevitable
court proceedings?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.556
- Not funny, Maeve.
- Okay, fine.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.809
No more jokes about you
potentially going to prison.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.395
Say, "Not guilty!"

02:25.437 --> 02:28.440
- This is a circle of hell
even Dante never imagined.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.652
- Time to party, losers.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.197
Oh, Bronwyn Rojas with the
little sister sympathy date.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.991
Ew, what a stunt queen.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.243
- Everywhere these people go
turns into a shit show.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.619
At least Addy had
the decency not to come

02:41.661 --> 02:43.163
to the game last night.
- Ugh.

02:43.204 --> 02:47.000
[engine revving]

02:47.042 --> 02:51.296
- * Who's gonna save you?
Who's gonna save you? *

02:51.338 --> 02:55.216
* Who's gonna save you now? *

02:55.258 --> 02:56.718
- Wait, is that...?

03:04.267 --> 03:05.769
- You look cute.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.354
Also, next time
I text the group chat,

03:07.395 --> 03:09.606
don't you dare
leave me on read.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.195
- Seriously, though,
we need to talk.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.530
- * Oh,
who's gonna save you? *

03:17.572 --> 03:19.240
* Who's gonna save you now? *

03:25.038 --> 03:26.664
- Okay, you want to tell me why
we're meeting a few feet away

03:26.706 --> 03:28.208
from the entire fucking school?

03:28.249 --> 03:30.919
- Someone was at the water park
last night stalking me,

03:30.960 --> 03:32.587
like, inside the park,
following me,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.547
and none of you were there.
- What? Who?

03:34.589 --> 03:36.466
Are you okay?
- Barely.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.009
- And they followed you
to Murder club?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.427
- We really need a rebranding.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.970
- If Nate hadn't finally
shown up,

03:41.012 --> 03:43.890
I'd be taking selfies
with Jesus right now.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.809
- I wanted to hear
what she had to say.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.602
You guys might wanna
hear it too.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.896
- I know who posted our secrets
to About That.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.481
- What?
- Who?

03:51.523 --> 03:53.441
- Right on cue.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.611
[intriguing music]

03:59.197 --> 04:00.865
- My art.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.951
- Vote for us
for homecoming courts

04:02.992 --> 04:04.911
if you wish
to come to my after-party.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.454
- Does he have your vote?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.915
Comes with an invitation to
get roofied at his pool party.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.542
- That is a hard pass.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.212
Also, does nobody see the irony
in voting for a monarchy?

04:14.254 --> 04:18.133
History teachers at this school
are failing us.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.884
- Democracy sucks.
- Right.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
- After all, he is most likely
to end up in Washington

04:22.220 --> 04:25.432
representing California's
48th congressional district.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.725
- Weren't you friends
with this guy?

04:26.766 --> 04:29.394
- Well, to be fair,
he was always an asshole.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.854
Then one summer, he got abs,

04:30.895 --> 04:32.897
and I draw the line
at an asshole with abs.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.607
- You drew the line?

04:38.486 --> 04:41.406
- You know, there should really
be some sort of public database

04:41.448 --> 04:42.949
for these charlatans.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.410
Expose these entitled assholes
for who they really are.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.912
- Yeah, there should be
an app for that.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.791
[intriguing music]

04:51.833 --> 04:53.710
- Well, now, there's an idea.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.341
You know what?
We should go to Homecoming.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.384
- Whoa, no.
- Together.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.802
- No, Simon, I can't,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.888
'cause I have to gouge
my eyes out that night.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.807
- And I'm serious.
- [scoffs]

05:07.849 --> 05:10.894
- We could get some inspiration
for this app idea.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.857
- You little fucked up
"Gossip Girl" wannabe.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.236
- "Gossip Girl"? Wow.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.321
You are gay.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.448
- And you fucking
ruined our lives.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.491
Why should we listen to her?

05:24.532 --> 05:26.701
- Just hear her out, please.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.203
Tell them about the messages.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.830
- Yeah, I posted your secrets,
but that's it.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.832
Somebody locked me out
and changed the password

05:32.874 --> 05:35.168
before the picture
of your meeting was posted,

05:35.210 --> 05:37.337
and the video of you, Bronwyn.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.588
Last time I tried to log in,
all I got

05:38.630 --> 05:39.798
was this threatening message.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.591
It popped up
and then disappeared.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.135
- What did it say?

05:44.177 --> 05:47.263
- "Simon says: back off."

05:47.305 --> 05:48.848
- But you have no proof.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.558
- Okay, do you guys have
any idea of what would happen

05:50.600 --> 05:52.435
if they catch us
meeting in secret again?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.853
How that'll look
in the eyes of the police,

05:53.895 --> 05:56.022
who we already know
are dying to make an arrest?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.482
- Wait, we think we know

05:57.524 --> 05:58.650
who killed Simon,
and who's been stalking us.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.777
- So just tell us already.

06:00.819 --> 06:01.611
- It's TJ.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.363
- TJ?
- Yeah.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.656
The day that Simon
was murdered,

06:04.698 --> 06:06.408
I saw TJ grab him in the hall.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.577
They had a whole argument.
It's how Simon got detention.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.413
I'm pretty sure
TJ was threatening him, okay?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.872
I didn't think anything
of it at first,

06:12.914 --> 06:15.375
but that's just because
I thought one of you did it.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.960
No offense.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.212
- What if TJ knew that Simon
was going to post our secrets?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.214
He told me he had done
something he wasn't proud of.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.299
- Of course you'd think
someone would kill for you.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.802
- Well, someone was stalking me
at the water park last night,

06:25.844 --> 06:28.638
and TJ has been messaging me,
and is obsessed with me.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.890
And after I broke his heart,
and he got suspended,

06:30.932 --> 06:33.143
someone revoked Janae's
access to About That,

06:33.184 --> 06:34.477
followed the four of us,

06:34.519 --> 06:36.855
and then posted that photo
of our meeting place.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.400
So, like, maybe you can
just believe women, Bronwyn.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.818
- Seriously?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.737
- TJ's like,
the chillest guy I've ever met.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.196
I really don't see it.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.991
- Is it possible
he's smarter than he looks

06:48.033 --> 06:51.411
and sounds and acts?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.955
Look, I mean, sometimes people
aren't what you expect.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.542
- And sometimes people
are exactly what you expect.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.752
This is ridiculous.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.253
- If it's so ridiculous,

07:00.295 --> 07:02.005
Nate would be crossing the
border into Tijuana right now.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.091
Instead, he's here,
helping me with my plan.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.259
- Is that true?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.386
- He had his passport
on him last night.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.804
He still has it
on his motorcycle,

07:09.846 --> 07:11.598
and he's planning to leave
if my plan doesn't--

07:11.639 --> 07:12.807
- I didn't think
it mattered to you

07:12.849 --> 07:14.392
where I parked my bike,
Bronwyn.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.229
- Okay, not this shit again.
What do you mean your plan?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.148
- TJ's here tonight.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.359
I can get close to him,
maybe tug on his heartstrings,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.903
distract him and then Nate
can swing by, swipe his phone,

07:24.944 --> 07:27.364
and we can use his location
data to retrace his steps.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.531
- No!

07:28.573 --> 07:29.491
If you're right about TJ,
that means

07:29.532 --> 07:31.534
that he's
a psycho stalker killer.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.078
You shouldn't be tugging
on anything of his.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.373
- He's actually right.
- Thanks.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.499
- You should do it.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.584
- Excuse me?
- You're his friend.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.294
Make him use his phone,
check the code.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.255
Once he's had a few drinks,
I'll bump into him and take it.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.965
- Okay, okay, say we do this.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.218
How are you going to get
the data off TJ's phone?

07:48.259 --> 07:49.886
- I heard that your sister's
good with computers

07:49.928 --> 07:52.722
and stuff, so--
- No, no way. Don't you see?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.641
She's pointing at someone else
so we don't focus on her.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.434
- Oh, that's
normally your thing.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.811
- What are you saying?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.813
- We all saw the video.
You stole the laptop.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.648
Clearly, you didn't want
your secret getting out.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.191
- Neither did any of you.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.693
And I didn't tell you
about the laptop

08:04.734 --> 08:06.152
because I didn't want
to implicate you,

08:06.194 --> 08:07.696
but you went ahead
and ratted me out

08:07.737 --> 08:08.988
the first chance you got.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.615
- They were pressuring me
about Cooper and--

08:10.657 --> 08:13.451
and his incident in the past.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
- What? So there's something?

08:15.537 --> 08:16.746
- That doesn't matter.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.748
- It matters
if you're still lying to us.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.000
- Okay, well,
I may not be perfect,

08:20.041 --> 08:21.376
but at least
I didn't fake my mom's death.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.837
- Okay, you guys, enough.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.006
There's someone out there
trying to frame us,

08:26.047 --> 08:28.842
and, judging by last night,
even trying to kill us.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.177
Can we all just work together
for one night?

[tense music]

08:35.098 --> 08:36.307
- Fine.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.853
But my sister's not gonna
be involved in this.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.898
And just so you know,
I don't trust her.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.193
I barely trust any of you.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.753

- Ridiculous? I know.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.006
- That's not
what I was gonna say.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.884
- That's not how I wanted you
to find out I was leaving.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.720
- Look, Janae's story
doesn't add up.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.722
If Simon was caught fighting
with TJ,

09:15.764 --> 09:17.182
then why wasn't TJ
in detention?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.060
- It would at least be
on his record.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.354
- So if the story is true,
then Gupta would have

09:22.395 --> 09:25.398
a record of the altercation.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.941
In her office.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.613
- Your parents are right.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.365
I am a bad influence.

disappeared at the same time.

You can at least get
the hashtag right

09:57.806 --> 09:59.516

a hashtag with those people?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.228
- Dude, why do you care?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.105
What, is this about Addy?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.065
Look, if you're still mad,
maybe you should talk to her.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
- It's not about her, man.
It's about you.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.736
That arm is a golden ticket.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.073
You know what I'd do
for that kind of talent?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.282
You know,
I'd be a shitty friend

10:16.324 --> 10:17.951
if I just sat around

10:17.992 --> 10:20.912
and watched you throw
that all away for them.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.998
- It's locked.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.042
- Try her desk
while I work on this one.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.676
- It's not here.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.595
Oh, I guess that makes sense

It's even bigger
than I thought it'd be.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.023
- That's bait.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.733
- You think there's anything
in here that might explain

11:31.775 --> 11:33.985
how your mom rose
from the dead?

11:34.027 --> 11:34.903

have you been waiting

11:34.944 --> 11:35.987

11:36.029 --> 11:37.197
- Oh, I don't know, Nate.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.366
Ever since I saw her
at your house, not dead.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.206
- I'm sorry
I lied to you, okay?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.792
But I'm not sorry
you didn't know the truth

11:48.833 --> 11:50.126
because that would mean
you know

11:50.168 --> 11:51.878
about her mental health issues,

11:51.920 --> 11:55.715
her drug problems,
how she abandoned me.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.218
I told the lie because
it was easier than the truth.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844

something like that,

11:59.886 --> 12:01.888

you're really not his type.

with Simon that day

the only reason

20:56.673 --> 20:58.008
you'd come

myself as chaotic neutral.

you always point out.

took a picture of you guys.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.084

is still out there.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.294
- Yeah, it's great
'cause that went nowhere

36:51.336 --> 36:53.797
and I made myself
a target tonight for nothing.

36:53.838 --> 36:57.175

37:06.518 --> 37:08.937
- Oh, shit, you're still alive?

37:10.939 --> 37:13.441
- Rumors of my death
have been greatly exaggerated.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.734
- Oh.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.569
What am I supposed
to do with this then?

You shouldn't have.

Houdini made with his wife?

37:38.008 --> 37:39.676
Whoever died first
had to contact the other

37:39.718 --> 37:40.844
from the grave?

37:40.885 --> 37:42.012
- Yes, and nothing ever came

37:42.053 --> 37:44.055
because ghosts
have better things to do.

37:44.097 --> 37:46.099
- It just got me thinking
about, you know,

37:46.141 --> 37:48.852
things I might never get
to say to you

37:48.893 --> 37:53.481
or, um, some things
I maybe sort of regret.

37:53.523 --> 37:55.900

- No. Hold on.

to back off from Maeve.

You fucking know that.

to make me say it.

I've ever met.

but I--

39:46.511 --> 39:49.848
I really need you to stop
because every time you do...

come into the room,

and not be seen in, like, what?

40:59.626 --> 41:00.877

who could.

- And what's her motive?

41:04.255 --> 41:06.007
I mean, Simon didn't have
anything on her.

41:06.049 --> 41:07.801

41:07.842 --> 41:10.637
What if Simon didn't post
all the secrets he knew?

41:10.679 --> 41:12.764
What if, sometimes, he would
trade for better gossip?

41:12.806 --> 41:14.808
- How would you know that?

41:14.849 --> 41:16.893
- I just found out Keely
was trying to keep Simon

41:16.935 --> 41:18.436
from posting one of my secrets

41:18.478 --> 41:20.355

for something better.

one of our secrets?

and TJ to protect you.

other people?

Oh, I get it.

42:08.737 --> 42:10.947
The four of you have convinced
each other you're innocent,

you've invented

42:12.198 --> 42:14.576

you were stalking us,
