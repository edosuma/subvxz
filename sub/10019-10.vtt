00:46.663 --> 00:49.282
I was starting to think
you weren't coming.

00:49.448 --> 00:51.553
Dr. Angelo's office was packed up.

00:51.688 --> 00:55.550
- What did she say?
- The tests don't detect a viral load.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.567
- I guess the drug cocktail is working.
- That's great news.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.517
Maybe I don't have to get a lawyer
now. The hospital might let it go.

01:04.071 --> 01:05.860
I know. It's still transmittable.

01:06.024 --> 01:10.366
It's not a reason to make you shuffle
paper for the rest of your career.

01:10.855 --> 01:12.284
If I still have a career.

01:13.352 --> 01:18.021
I have a meeting with Dr. Greene and
Dr. Anspaugh in 10 minutes.

01:18.183 --> 01:22.788
And I think you're too valuable
to rubber-stamp admits all day long.

01:23.399 --> 01:24.861
Thanks.
This is on me.

01:25.511 --> 01:28.413
No matter what happens in there,
this is great news.

01:38.279 --> 01:41.891
- Sled to work, Dr. Greene?
- Christmas present for my daughter.

01:42.056 --> 01:43.965
- That's it?
- You remember sliding in those...

01:44.136 --> 01:47.103
...snow-covered bluffs with the cold
wind blowing through your hair.

01:47.271 --> 01:49.213
We didn't have too many
snow-covered bluffs in Atlanta.

01:49.384 --> 01:53.093
We did. I coasted right through
rush-hour traffic, got hit by a car.

01:53.255 --> 01:56.103
Didn't they have
one of those dolls that wet itself?

01:56.231 --> 02:02.690
Every toy in the store had a tie-in
to a movie I was too busy to see.

02:02.887 --> 02:06.531
I don't know what Duke Nukem was,
but he looked pretty nasty.

02:06.695 --> 02:08.637
You made a good choice with the sled.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.669
- You look awful. When did you start?
- Yesterday morning.

02:13.543 --> 02:16.892
- Mark, you ready?
- Good morning. I just gotta change.

02:17.064 --> 02:20.446
- For you, Dennis.
- Somebody's trying to touch me?

02:20.616 --> 02:22.525
It's a lady.

02:23.784 --> 02:27.199
Hey, Monique.
You're at the airport?

02:28.488 --> 02:30.048
Was it canceled?

02:31.207 --> 02:34.720
Come on, I thought
we've been through this already.

02:39.175 --> 02:41.509
You want the two of us to decide?

02:41.672 --> 02:47.039
None of us here would want
any of our team endangering patients.

02:47.688 --> 02:50.819
As Attendings, you're closest to
the everyday workings of the ER.

02:50.983 --> 02:52.674
So there is no hospital-wide policy.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.295
Legal advises
we handle it department by department.

02:55.463 --> 02:58.497
So if we get sued, it's the individual
attending's butt that's on the line?

02:58.663 --> 03:04.544
If the public learned that we had
an HIV-positive health-care worker...

03:04.679 --> 03:07.232
...and started filing suits,
all of our butts would be on the line.

03:07.431 --> 03:11.261
So these workers can be fired because
the hospital doesn't want to be sued.

03:11.463 --> 03:16.351
In Illinois you can't fire employees
because they're HIV-positive.

03:16.519 --> 03:20.032
- But people have been forced to quit.
- Nobody is forcing anybody to quit.

03:20.199 --> 03:23.811
What about restricting duties so they
no longer fit the job description?

03:23.976 --> 03:28.547
I wouldn't presume to tell you two
how to run your department, but...

03:28.711 --> 03:33.184
...to give you an idea about the current
thinking, these are the CDC findings...

03:33.320 --> 03:35.741
...IIlinois state law
and pending legal cases...

03:35.911 --> 03:38.628
...and various NIH
and journal reports.

03:38.824 --> 03:42.053
I know you two have had your
differences in the past.

03:42.216 --> 03:44.605
Do you think you can work together
and solve this?

03:46.504 --> 03:47.878
Absolutely.

03:50.503 --> 03:52.259
Sure.

04:41.927 --> 04:44.294
Can you put on the card "Merry
Christmas, Mom. Love, Doug"?

04:44.487 --> 04:45.981
And can you make that
a rush order?

04:46.183 --> 04:49.630
Dennis, what is up with that shower?
I froze my ass off this morning.

04:49.799 --> 04:51.938
- Did you hear the opera?
<i>- Ll Figaro</i> ?

04:52.103 --> 04:54.721
Mrs. Needlebaum. 45 minutes
of sing-along with Pavarotti...

04:54.887 --> 04:58.051
...and she uses up all the hot water.
- Did you get any sleep last night?

04:58.215 --> 05:01.062
- No, I had 15 admits.
- Fifteen? Wow!

05:01.223 --> 05:03.907
Only 10 more hours and then Yuletide
cheer with the Carter family.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.820
I feel bad subjecting you
and your girlfriend to my family.

05:06.983 --> 05:09.667
It's not going to happen.
Monique isn't coming.

05:09.799 --> 05:13.476
- Not at all?
- She said she had work.

05:13.671 --> 05:17.020
Oh, damn. I thought you guys
were going to work it out too.

05:17.223 --> 05:19.711
It's her loss. I'll be a little late
with all these new patients.

05:19.911 --> 05:23.773
No worry. Things don't get interesting
until Uncle Branch starts drinking.

05:23.943 --> 05:27.205
- You got your picks for the Bowl pool?
- Here. How much is it? Five bucks?

05:27.367 --> 05:30.563
- Twenty.
- Twenty, that's highway robbery.

05:30.727 --> 05:32.735
- How much is in the pot?
- 400.

05:33.511 --> 05:37.984
I'm with you for Rose and Fiesta, but
Cotton and Liberty are a waste.

05:38.151 --> 05:40.126
Why is everyone standing around
when I'm drowning with patients?

05:40.263 --> 05:42.467
- I'm on hold with the florist.
- Not anymore you're not.

05:42.631 --> 05:45.500
- And merry Christmas Eve to you.
- Please don't talk to me about it.

05:45.703 --> 05:48.517
At 5:00 this morning my mother
decided she had to start the <i>varenyky.</i>

05:48.680 --> 05:50.054
- Aren't those little dumplings?
- Yeah.

05:50.248 --> 05:53.314
She also picked the pre-dawn hour
to harass me about the party.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.618
So you're wearing that sexy
Ukrainian shepherdess outfit?

05:55.783 --> 05:57.856
It was either that
or endure hours of nagging.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.642
Okay, snowmobile
foot lac in the Suture Room.

06:00.808 --> 06:03.622
Toddler eating mistletoe in 1.
Slip-and-fall in 3.

06:03.783 --> 06:05.693
Watch out for Carol.
It's Christmas in the Ukraine.

06:05.863 --> 06:07.750
- Is her mom making little dumplings?
- Don't ask.

06:07.911 --> 06:11.326
I heard Anspaugh is having
some kind of secret meeting.

06:11.463 --> 06:14.082
- Anything we should know about?
- We have to hammer out a policy...

06:14.248 --> 06:16.255
...on HIV-positive
health-care workers.

06:16.423 --> 06:18.365
Anybody we know?
Really?

06:18.567 --> 06:22.757
He is trying to kill me. He ain't
getting this goose, I stuffed it...

06:22.919 --> 06:26.465
...trussed it, called my 83-year-old
grandma to get her marinade recipe.

06:26.631 --> 06:28.736
- Oh, yeah, this gentleman...
- Female illusionist.

06:28.903 --> 06:32.132
...got into an argument with his
boyfriend. It got heated, and he...

06:32.295 --> 06:33.888
- she started getting chest pain.

06:34.056 --> 06:36.958
It was like an elephant
sitting on my chest with attitude.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.950
- She was diaphoretic.
- I never said that!

06:39.111 --> 06:41.020
- That means sweaty.
- Yeah.

06:41.191 --> 06:43.231
It nearly ruined my gown.

06:43.367 --> 06:47.295
Pressure's 130 over 95,
resp is 25, slightly tachy at 120.

06:47.463 --> 06:50.779
- Tacky? This is a Bob Mackie original.
- Get ready. One, two, three...

06:52.583 --> 06:55.682
I need a chest x-ray,
cardiac enzymes and an EKG.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.756
- Okay, Miss...?
- Understood.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.228
Of "Miss Understood and the Mighty
Morphin Gender Changers."

07:00.391 --> 07:02.300
We are at Club Cabaret
every Friday and Saturday.

07:02.471 --> 07:05.667
Give me the goose now so
we can attach an EKG to your chest.

07:05.831 --> 07:08.003
You want me to give you
my Christmas dinner? No!

07:08.167 --> 07:10.021
- Give me the damn bird.
- Where are you going to put it?

07:10.183 --> 07:11.971
With the rest
of your personal belongings.

07:12.135 --> 07:14.524
It'd better be. I don't want to wake
up and see you picking your teeth.

07:14.695 --> 07:18.077
- Are you on any medication?
- Not besides the hormones.

07:18.216 --> 07:21.925
- Have you had chest pain before?
- When I get emotional...

07:22.119 --> 07:24.028
...or on that time of the month.

07:25.927 --> 07:28.775
- It's someone in this department.
- Who?

07:28.967 --> 07:31.585
I don't know.
It's just the word on the street.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.291
Tech on third floor heard it from
a night guy, and now a secret meeting.

07:36.455 --> 07:40.034
- See, that's how rumors get started.
- A rumor? Am I missing a good one?

07:40.199 --> 07:43.973
Attendings got pulled into a meeting,
but they won't say what it's about.

07:44.135 --> 07:46.786
About someone with HIV,
but you didn't hear it from me.

07:46.919 --> 07:49.886
Randi, do something with these
personal effects. They're perishable.

07:50.055 --> 07:52.869
Jeanie, head lac in Exam 2.

07:53.063 --> 07:55.813
Conni, if you're not too busy...

07:56.647 --> 08:00.870
Some folks are getting too fond of the
"manager" part of nurse manager.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.469
- No kidding.
- Carol?

08:02.663 --> 08:04.867
Sorry, but Mark
assigned me to Triage today.

08:05.031 --> 08:08.806
Come on, guys! Why do I have to push
all the time? I'm not your mother.

08:13.319 --> 08:15.741
Excuse me, I need a doctor.

08:15.911 --> 08:20.167
- Fill these out in the waiting room.
- No, I'm looking for Dr. Ross.

08:20.295 --> 08:23.262
For a medical problem?
You still need to fill out this form.

08:23.431 --> 08:26.366
The waiting room is that way.

08:27.239 --> 08:29.988
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

08:30.151 --> 08:34.210
We're going to need a facial and a
mandibular series, 75 mg of Demerol...

08:34.375 --> 08:36.447
...and Phenergan, I.M.

08:36.615 --> 08:39.812
Try and rustle up an oral surgeon too.
Good luck with that.

08:39.975 --> 08:42.909
And get me a gram of Ancef, I.M.

08:43.078 --> 08:44.486
You got it.

08:45.639 --> 08:48.356
Are you allergic to any meds?

08:48.519 --> 08:51.137
Okay, I think that your jaw is broken.

08:51.271 --> 08:55.526
The antibiotics will keep bacteria
from getting into your bloodstream.

08:55.687 --> 09:00.705
But looking at your chart here,
I guess you know the drill, huh?

09:00.903 --> 09:05.180
Humerus fracture, 1993.
Nasal fracture, 1993.

09:05.382 --> 09:10.750
Multiple visits for suture, 1994.
And your first broken jaw, December '95.

09:10.919 --> 09:14.334
I guess hubby thought
he'd go out with a bang this year too.

09:14.503 --> 09:18.431
- It was an accident.
- Your face got in the way of his fist.

09:21.639 --> 09:23.810
What if we change the disclosure
to include...

09:24.007 --> 09:26.789
...that people might be treated
by an HIV-positive worker?

09:27.015 --> 09:30.692
- And start a witch hunt?
- We have to inform patients by law.

09:30.887 --> 09:34.149
- I take it you haven't read this.
- Americans with Disabilities Act.

09:34.343 --> 09:37.604
- What is it? Proposals, addenda?
- Here.

09:37.799 --> 09:41.760
It says that you can't disclose one
risk without disclosing equal risks.

09:41.927 --> 09:44.512
- Meaning?
- The patient doesn't have a choice...

09:44.679 --> 09:47.778
...whether they're treated by someone
with a flu or with a hangover...

09:47.943 --> 09:51.555
...a doc who had a fight. An
intern who's been on for two days...

09:51.719 --> 09:53.028
...someone with HIV.

09:53.191 --> 09:56.420
Illinois law says we can't
prevent people from knowing...

09:56.551 --> 09:58.885
...they've been put at risk.
We have to tell them.

09:59.047 --> 10:02.276
You'd rather follow the Illinois law
than the federal statute?

10:02.471 --> 10:04.675
Because I'm concerned doesn't mean
I'm some kind of bigot.

10:04.839 --> 10:07.774
Your concern can't be extended to
prevent Jeanie from earning a living.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.212
Nobody is talking about firing her.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.764
But we do have
a responsibility to our patients.

10:12.935 --> 10:17.408
What about our responsibility towards
her? She uses universal precautions.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.569
- Are you frightened? Is that it?
- I'm trying to avoid lawsuits.

10:21.735 --> 10:22.945
You think I want to get sued?

10:23.111 --> 10:28.642
But exposing her private tragedy
ensures lawsuits and mass hysteria.

10:28.775 --> 10:31.808
- We break the law?
- Lf we have to, yes.

10:31.975 --> 10:33.885
I care about Jeanie...

10:34.087 --> 10:37.567
...but there's a larger issue than
your personal loyalty to a friend.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.931
Sorry to interrupt, but we're swamped.
Whenever your done.

10:41.095 --> 10:44.575
- We're done now.
- Mark, we haven't even made a dent.

10:44.743 --> 10:50.078
Would you rather jeopardize patient
care by ignoring a jam in Triage?

10:52.327 --> 10:54.661
Who's next? Santa Claus?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.481
No, that's who's next.
Three hookers.

10:56.646 --> 10:58.686
One with downstairs discharge,
and two with frostbite.

10:58.823 --> 11:02.467
I turn around, next thing I know,
the ribbon's hanging from his mouth.

11:02.631 --> 11:05.697
- All I could get was the leaves.
- How many berries were on the stalk?

11:05.894 --> 11:07.269
Maybe four.

11:07.431 --> 11:09.700
- And he wasn't vomiting?
- No.

11:09.863 --> 11:12.416
This mistletoe is good stuff,
but we gotta get it out.

11:12.583 --> 11:16.511
He asked for juice. I didn't want
to give him any till you approved.

11:16.679 --> 11:20.028
Lily, make a bottle
half juice, half activated charcoal.

11:20.199 --> 11:22.271
Coming right up.

11:25.479 --> 11:30.465
We're going to give him a bottle
to absorb some of the toxins.

11:30.727 --> 11:31.971
Excuse me.

11:33.799 --> 11:38.884
There you are. I've been looking
for you at the shelter. Come here.

11:39.079 --> 11:42.210
- How is he?
- There was blood in his diaper.

11:42.887 --> 11:46.367
- In the stool or the urine?
- I'm pretty sure it was in the pee.

11:46.535 --> 11:50.626
I gotta get him home before his mom
gets back. If not, she'll kick me out.

11:50.791 --> 11:53.311
You need to get his mother here now.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.519
Can't you just hook him up
with pills or something?

11:55.687 --> 11:59.997
No, I can't just hook him up with
some pills. Get his mother here.

12:02.215 --> 12:05.117
- What happened to him?
- The guy's name is John Collins.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.321
He was drunk and sleeping in the park.
Some kids thought it would be fun...

12:08.487 --> 12:10.821
...to pour lighter fluid on him
and play yule log.

12:10.983 --> 12:13.830
He wouldn't let us put oxygen on him.
He kept screaming about Nick.

12:20.711 --> 12:23.646
He's got extensive third-degree
burns to the chest.

12:23.815 --> 12:26.270
It's the guy's dog. Barked at a
mounted cop until he checked it out.

12:26.439 --> 12:28.097
Randi, can you take care of this dog?

12:28.263 --> 12:31.678
You take care of my Nick now.
You take care of my Nicky.

12:31.847 --> 12:34.749
- Take it easy, Mr. Collins.
- He'll be in a kennel.

12:34.887 --> 12:39.840
- No! No kennel, he's all I've got.
- Extremities are toast. No IV, no BP.

12:40.007 --> 12:42.724
- He needs massive fluids.
- You gotta promise me, doc.

12:42.919 --> 12:46.497
- Promise me now.
- We'll look after it, just be quiet.

12:46.663 --> 12:50.460
On my count, everyone.
I'm going to need a cutdown tray.

12:50.663 --> 12:56.326
Get me blood gas with CO level, CBC,
Chem-20, a portable chest for openers.

13:03.974 --> 13:05.535
Is he okay?

13:05.703 --> 13:08.485
He's got a mass in his abdomen.

13:08.615 --> 13:11.037
Once I get inside
I'll know how bad it is.

13:11.206 --> 13:13.061
- Is it bad?
- Yes.

13:13.255 --> 13:15.644
- The ultrasound is ready.
- Did you get hold of the mother?

13:15.846 --> 13:17.886
- She isn't home.
- Any adult relatives?

13:18.087 --> 13:21.916
There aren't any. I take care of him
when Gloria's not around.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.744
Hang on.

13:27.399 --> 13:28.609
There it is.

13:28.775 --> 13:34.787
He's hemorrhaging into his kidney.
Get lytes, a CBC, a CT of the abdomen.

13:35.431 --> 13:38.627
- Haleh, page the O.R. Too.
- What does it say?

13:38.759 --> 13:42.981
Ahmed's got something called a Wilms'
tumor. You see that area there?

13:43.143 --> 13:44.735
- That fluid?
- The light gray?

13:44.935 --> 13:47.804
Yes, that's blood.
The tumor's invading his kidney.

13:48.007 --> 13:50.495
That's why you see
all that blood in his diaper.

13:50.695 --> 13:53.564
- I should've brought him here before.
- I gotta get him to the O.R.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.734
I knew he was sick.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.910
Is he gonna die?

13:59.654 --> 14:01.727
You did a good thing, Charlie.

14:07.655 --> 14:11.484
Now dissect the right colon off
the anterior surface of the tumor.

14:11.622 --> 14:14.917
- Shall I retract the tumor laterally?
- Yes, very gently.

14:15.079 --> 14:16.901
That's it.

14:17.063 --> 14:19.910
You say that the babysitter
brought the child in?

14:20.070 --> 14:23.453
Yes, the mother was nowhere to be
found. Dr. Ross knows the girl.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.207
Now retract the tumor laterally.

14:26.375 --> 14:32.736
Tie off the renal vein and artery
and ureter and transect it.

14:35.303 --> 14:38.718
Slowly, now.
Avoid the left renal vessels.

14:40.039 --> 14:43.486
Now free up the kidney,
and we'll take it out.

14:45.255 --> 14:50.786
- All the pretty, twinkly lights.
- That's why you danced with the elves.

14:50.982 --> 14:54.146
I'd like some sherry now.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.278
- What's your name, ma'am?
- I'm Blitzen.

14:57.447 --> 15:04.637
- The most overlooked of all reindeer.
- Blitzen.

15:04.807 --> 15:09.378
It's your lucky day, Beth.
You only have a fractured cheekbone.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.885
It means you can go home.
Unless you don't want to.

15:14.055 --> 15:17.470
There is a shelter called Hope House
for women and kids in trouble.

15:17.607 --> 15:20.258
- I don't have kids.
- It's okay, you can go there alone.

15:20.423 --> 15:22.114
- They have security.
- He'll find me.

15:22.310 --> 15:25.888
They have reciprocal agreements with
shelters all over the country.

15:26.054 --> 15:28.902
- You could go anywhere you want.
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

15:29.094 --> 15:32.542
I knew I should have fixed
that top step, but I've been so busy.

15:32.711 --> 15:36.093
Do you forgive me?
Can you forgive me, honey?

15:37.415 --> 15:40.230
I love you.

15:40.391 --> 15:42.846
That's my girl.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.616
- Is she going to be all right?
- We're actually not done, Mr. Lang.

15:47.751 --> 15:51.362
We still need to do a head CT, facial
tomograms, put her on IV antibiotics.

15:51.526 --> 15:54.428
- Is that going to take long?
- We do our best with the holidays.

15:54.631 --> 15:59.933
Family isn't allowed in the exam
area. Malik, show him the chairs.

16:00.135 --> 16:02.436
Sure.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.984
I'll be right outside, honey.

16:13.766 --> 16:16.701
So you want to hear
some more about those shelters?

16:16.871 --> 16:21.246
- No good?
- I've tried cookies, fruitcake.

16:21.382 --> 16:24.765
- Nobody likes fruitcake.
- I thought dogs ate everything.

16:24.934 --> 16:27.585
Why not take him to the morgue
and let him beg for table scraps?

16:27.783 --> 16:31.907
That's Mr. Collins.
Maybe he knows what you like to eat.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.845
I think he likes you.

16:42.023 --> 16:44.390
- What's going on?
- While moving him to the burn unit...

16:44.551 --> 16:48.129
...he had shortness of breath.
BP's 80 palp, tachycardic at 140.

16:48.295 --> 16:50.750
All right, get me
a 40-mg IV bolus of Lasix.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.374
- We need to intubate, 7.5.
- He's bradying down.

16:53.830 --> 16:58.108
- Rate's 40, no pulse.
- Damn it! Get me a mg of atropine.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.125
- Start CPR.
- Asystole.

17:01.319 --> 17:05.627
All right, let's give him an amp of
epi. Come on Mr. Collins. Come on.

17:05.830 --> 17:09.824
I don't care if Psych is backed up.
She thinks she's a reindeer.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.990
Well, dangerous?
You know, she bruised an elf.

17:13.159 --> 17:16.421
- Excuse me, miss.
- Who parked in the ambulance bay?

17:16.583 --> 17:21.372
The car's mine, actually my employer's.
I'm looking for a missing person.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.681
Take a number, sir.
The line starts in the waiting room.

17:23.815 --> 17:28.092
- It's a woma"n with a hand puppet.
- Did you say puppet?

17:29.671 --> 17:32.900
- You found him something to munch on.
- He found it himself.

17:35.462 --> 17:39.488
- Are dogs meant to eat chicken bones?
- Is that chicken?

17:42.215 --> 17:46.623
Charlie, Ahmed is out of surgery.
He's going to be okay.

17:46.790 --> 17:50.107
- I can take him home now?
- No, he'll need time to recover.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.540
- Gloria is going to be pissed.
- I'm going to have to call DCFS.

17:53.702 --> 17:55.742
- You're going to narc her out?
- I'm not narcing on anybody.

17:55.878 --> 17:58.595
The boy's been sick. The mother
should have seen that weeks ago.

17:58.758 --> 18:01.508
Gloria didn't know. She just
found out. She sounds really worried.

18:02.246 --> 18:04.832
- Come on, she'll throw me out.
- So you live with her.

18:05.255 --> 18:07.972
- So you lied to me about the shelter.
- Come on, please.

18:09.062 --> 18:13.056
All right, I'll give her a chance.
But I'm not promising you anything.

18:15.334 --> 18:19.491
Eating hospital food? That desperate?
Come on, let's get some lunch.

18:28.870 --> 18:30.910
- You scared me.
- The surgery went really well.

18:31.078 --> 18:33.947
Yeah, it did.
My 3:00 hernia was canceled.

18:34.918 --> 18:38.628
So I am free tonight. So I figured,
if you hadn't made any plans...

18:38.791 --> 18:41.376
...I could make my traditional
phone call to Pizza Ring.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.397
I got a family thing.

18:43.558 --> 18:46.241
I already asked
a friend of mine to go with me.

18:46.406 --> 18:49.341
I understand.
It was last minute anyway.

18:49.511 --> 18:55.174
- Christmas Eve.
- I'll rent a movie, it's what I do.

18:55.334 --> 19:01.084
Let me talk to my buddy. He was tired
earlier. He may prefer to go home.

19:04.519 --> 19:10.334
So... Let's do something later.
Pizza sounds great.

19:12.006 --> 19:17.407
Gingerbread. It always reminds me of
Christmas at home. You ever do that?

19:18.534 --> 19:22.789
In a civilized society, people
acknowledge each other's speech.

19:22.951 --> 19:25.733
You want to talk about
Christmas at my home?

19:25.895 --> 19:30.303
Home is where my mom got bombed out
of her mind and brought a drunk home.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.285
Then she'd pass out, giving him
the idea he'd rather sleep with me.

19:33.415 --> 19:36.611
All right, we know why you left.
How far did you run?

19:36.774 --> 19:39.873
- From Cleveland.
- Did you call her lately?

19:40.070 --> 19:43.813
She probably moved on by now. She
never stays anywhere for very long.

19:44.614 --> 19:48.575
Both of these, plus the three Danish,
the two packets of cocoa...

19:48.742 --> 19:50.946
...and the two dinner rolls
in her pocket.

19:52.263 --> 19:53.572
Great. Thanks.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.187
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

19:56.359 --> 20:01.116
I have now changed every drain and
lanced every boil in this hospital.

20:01.286 --> 20:05.694
34 hours. I'm now ready for
that Jell-O thing your cook makes.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.612
Aspic. That's what I want
to talk to you about.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.091
Say no more.
I have an aunt who makes chitterlings.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.977
You don't even want to know
what that's all about.

20:15.142 --> 20:20.031
Okay. There is a chance that
I may not be able to make the party.

20:20.934 --> 20:24.196
- Are you working?
- No.

20:24.838 --> 20:27.205
There's this girl.

20:27.366 --> 20:30.749
- That's cool, I understand.
- You're sure?

20:30.919 --> 20:33.668
Who wants to hang with his homies
when he can be with a honey?

20:33.830 --> 20:35.652
- You gonna be...?
- I'll be fine.

20:35.782 --> 20:39.492
- It's a chance to go home and sleep.
- Don't hang over me. I'll be fine.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.524
Let's do something tomorrow night.
Go out, get a couple of beers.

20:42.726 --> 20:45.476
I'm on tomorrow night.

20:46.150 --> 20:49.630
I know what universal precautions are.
Does it refer to double gloves here?

20:49.798 --> 20:54.719
- You're exaggerating with guidelines.
- And participating in bloody trauma?

20:54.886 --> 20:56.741
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Bloody trauma.

20:56.902 --> 21:00.251
- Maybe that's the deal with Dr. Lewis.
- I don't think Susan's HIV-positive.

21:00.423 --> 21:02.659
- Susan is fine.
- That's what I said.

21:02.822 --> 21:05.408
- Lydia's been sick a lot lately.
- Shut your mouth.

21:05.575 --> 21:09.830
I expect more from you than gossiping
about a coworker's HIV status.

21:09.958 --> 21:14.082
Kerry and I have been hammering out
a policy. There's no secret there.

21:14.278 --> 21:15.903
This shouldn't be a grist
for the rumor mill.

21:16.102 --> 21:19.714
Why should we have HIV-positive
employees in ER at all?

21:19.879 --> 21:24.865
According to the current law,
Employee X...

21:25.031 --> 21:26.940
...cannot be fired
because of their HIV status.

21:27.110 --> 21:30.077
- But they can deal with bloody trauma?
- Why not, if they're gloved?

21:30.246 --> 21:33.093
- Was it from a needle stick?
- What difference does it make?

21:33.254 --> 21:38.011
Should Employee X be restricted
to non-invasive procedures?

21:38.182 --> 21:41.859
- Or continue with their duties?
- Won't universal precautions be safe?

21:41.990 --> 21:45.438
That's what we're told when we're
working on HIV-positive patients.

21:45.638 --> 21:50.243
The real question here is whether
our patients have the right to know.

21:50.406 --> 21:54.497
This has no reflection
upon my opinion of Employee X's work.

21:54.662 --> 22:00.575
- Is there an actual Employee X?
- It's a policy. It could be any of us.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.481
Excuse me.

22:05.286 --> 22:08.898
Would everyone
stop calling me Employee X?

22:09.062 --> 22:12.062
I am HIV-positive.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.200
We talked about this.

22:23.366 --> 22:27.228
The risks of her bleeding into an
open wound while suturing are remote.

22:27.398 --> 22:30.846
I'm not saying she can't work,
but I'm trying to set the boundaries.

22:31.014 --> 22:33.982
You set the boundaries at Triage and
answering phones. That's not her job.

22:34.151 --> 22:36.572
I have no troubles if she performs
her duties within limits.

22:36.742 --> 22:41.531
Dispensing medication, that's fine.
But some things aren't. For example:

22:41.702 --> 22:46.437
It says here, "Deep-penetrating,
poorly visualized cavities."

22:46.566 --> 22:48.803
That's from the CDC.
I think that should be off-limits.

22:48.998 --> 22:53.276
- I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.
- Okay. See, progress.

22:53.478 --> 22:56.413
You know, Mark. Since I found out,
I have been a lot more careful.

22:56.614 --> 23:00.127
- You think I would harm a patient?
- No, I don't.

23:00.294 --> 23:05.116
But the administration
has left it up to Kerry and I...

23:05.286 --> 23:09.792
...to create a policy that the
government can't seem to agree on.

23:09.958 --> 23:14.399
I've agonized over this.
I've considered quitting, but...

23:14.534 --> 23:17.698
...my life can still have value.
I can still help people.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.163
What else are you worried about?

23:22.022 --> 23:25.851
Dementia. You're fine now,
but what if you decline?

23:26.054 --> 23:29.436
Dementia may be the first sign
of full-blown AIDS.

23:30.214 --> 23:33.629
I've heard that there's some hospitals
that instituted a physician monitor.

23:33.798 --> 23:35.969
Someone to help
keep tabs on the person's health.

23:36.134 --> 23:37.923
I could do that.

23:39.846 --> 23:43.807
Okay.
So that's one thing. What else?

23:59.622 --> 24:03.299
- So was it a needle stick?
- I guess so. You don't think she...?

24:03.462 --> 24:06.496
- Hi, Jeanie.
- Hi.

24:10.534 --> 24:13.087
- Hey, Jeanie.
- Hey.

24:13.254 --> 24:15.042
I wish I'd known.

24:15.206 --> 24:17.956
- Would it have made us friends?
- Now, that's not fair.

24:18.086 --> 24:20.159
Nothing is.

24:24.582 --> 24:26.338
- Well?
- Mr. Lang. Hi.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.388
Is Beth okay?
I've been sitting here for hours.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.681
I'm sorry. Your wife's fall is worse
than we initially thought.

24:31.846 --> 24:35.326
She might have to stay
overnight for observation.

24:35.494 --> 24:38.461
Anyway, the coroner is going to have
my butt if we don't get him this guy.

24:38.630 --> 24:42.242
So why don't you just wait?

24:49.766 --> 24:53.083
Hey, buddy! This patient
is going to the bus station.

24:53.222 --> 24:57.248
- A stiff?
- Miraculous recovery.

24:58.662 --> 25:02.720
Here you go.
For your bus ticket and some burgers.

25:04.710 --> 25:07.132
I can't take this from you.

25:07.302 --> 25:09.309
Go on,
you got a 3:15 to Abilene to catch.

25:09.478 --> 25:12.576
- I don't even know where that is.
- Hopefully, neither does he.

25:14.950 --> 25:16.510
Bye.

25:18.822 --> 25:21.025
You won the pool. Congratulations.

25:21.190 --> 25:25.446
- That was the football pool money?
- Yeah, I thought she was a better bet.

25:25.574 --> 25:28.673
Alternators, amusement, ammunition...

25:28.870 --> 25:32.166
- There's no animal shelters.
- Check humane societies.

25:32.358 --> 25:35.108
You can't give him away.
You promised Mr. Collins.

25:35.270 --> 25:39.972
That's before I paid 50 bucks to
a drag queen for a free-range goose.

25:40.166 --> 25:43.362
You know what happens
when they can't find homes for dogs?

25:45.446 --> 25:48.229
- What am I gonna do with a dog?
- Dogs are great.

25:48.390 --> 25:50.528
They're good company. They
watch your stuff when you're gone.

25:50.694 --> 25:52.320
Your daughter will love him.

25:52.486 --> 25:54.853
- Do you think?
- Yeah, my dad got me a dog.

25:54.982 --> 25:57.470
Skippy, when I was 6.
Best present I ever got.

25:57.638 --> 26:01.762
The two of us were like
peanut butter and jelly.

26:07.846 --> 26:10.180
- I can take you all in for kidnapping.
- He was sick.

26:10.566 --> 26:13.882
- Don't tell me how to raise my son!
- I'm Dr. Ross. Can I help you?

26:14.982 --> 26:18.877
- You can give me back my son.
- Your son just had major surgery.

26:19.046 --> 26:21.151
- I'll call the cops on your ass.
- Are you high, Gloria?

26:21.318 --> 26:24.995
- I'm clean. You don't know anything.
- The DCFS will decide.

26:25.158 --> 26:28.093
- You promised you wouldn't narc!
- I did give her a chance.

26:28.230 --> 26:30.848
- She's just scared.
- You come in here messed up.

26:31.014 --> 26:34.178
You don't ask about your critically
ill son, so why don't you have a seat?

26:34.374 --> 26:37.189
I'll get my kid back, you bastard!
You think you can mess with a Latina?

26:37.382 --> 26:40.765
I'll call my lawyer up in here
and sue you all!

26:40.966 --> 26:42.908
You're just like the rest of them!

26:43.078 --> 26:44.507
Gloria, wait up!

26:54.374 --> 26:56.610
What's that?

26:56.774 --> 27:00.157
The homeless guy's dog.
The dog saved his life.

27:00.294 --> 27:03.676
I told him that I'd watch out for him,
and the next thing I know...

27:03.846 --> 27:08.221
...the guy up and dies on me.
- So you're the proud owner of...

27:08.422 --> 27:11.139
Well, given the season,
you should call him Saint Nick.

27:11.302 --> 27:14.149
Well, Rachel can call him
whatever she wants.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.000
- Rachel?
- Yes.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.173
I thought I'd give her
a puppy for Christmas.

27:18.342 --> 27:21.124
In case you hadn't noticed,
that dog is, like, 8 years old.

27:21.286 --> 27:24.635
He's ready for a midlife crisis.
He's ready for a fur replacement.

27:24.806 --> 27:30.272
With a wash, a bow around his
neck, he won't look a day over 5.

27:30.406 --> 27:32.827
- Do you know how to bathe dogs?
- What's to know?

27:32.998 --> 27:35.169
- Could you hold him?
- Yeah, for 20 bucks.

27:35.334 --> 27:38.531
- Twenty bucks. It's a little steep.
- I lost my wallet. I need a loan.

27:38.726 --> 27:40.614
- Deal.
- Okay.

27:41.798 --> 27:44.132
- Hang on.
- You got him? Hold on.

27:48.518 --> 27:52.260
- Damn it!
- See to your head. I'll get the dog.

28:11.430 --> 28:14.691
- Can I get some help?
- Yeah.

28:18.918 --> 28:21.667
- That looks pretty deep.
- Dog trauma.

28:21.829 --> 28:24.546
Yeah, he went that way,
giving Doug a run for his money.

28:24.709 --> 28:27.076
It looks like I need some stitches,
don't you think?

28:28.262 --> 28:30.847
- You want me to call someone?
- No, I want you to do it.

28:33.510 --> 28:34.687
Okay.

28:39.686 --> 28:42.173
- Very William Powell.
- Aren't they great?

28:42.374 --> 28:45.276
- Silk?
- Try it on.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.043
Dr. Keaton?

28:49.061 --> 28:50.687
Yes, Dr. Benton.

28:51.174 --> 28:55.265
- Is this a bad time?
- No, I was reviewing some anatomy.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.982
- May I come in for a moment?
- Sure.

29:00.837 --> 29:06.686
First, I'd like to thank you for the
large role in the Lopez nephrectomy.

29:06.822 --> 29:09.375
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.614
That's actually why I'm here.

29:11.782 --> 29:14.881
I'd like to do
another Pediatric Surgery rotation.

29:15.078 --> 29:19.388
- I won't be here next rotation.
- I know.

29:19.589 --> 29:25.405
I was hoping for your recommendation
for me with your replacement.

29:28.166 --> 29:34.363
You're a very good surgeon, Peter,
but that's not enough for Pedes.

29:34.534 --> 29:37.382
You've got to live
and breathe for children.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.997
You took this rotation
to challenge yourself.

29:40.134 --> 29:42.752
I applaud that, but I can't...

29:42.918 --> 29:49.509
...give up a space that could be
filled by a future pediatric surgeon.

29:49.670 --> 29:52.485
I'd be happy to talk to
Dr. Anspaugh or Morgenstern.

29:52.646 --> 29:56.420
I hear that Don's doing some
really interesting stuff in thoracics.

29:56.582 --> 29:59.299
No, no, no. Thank you.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.611
I wouldn't want to waste
any more of your time.

30:21.029 --> 30:24.542
You've got an old scar.
It looks like you've done this before.

30:24.709 --> 30:28.735
I played rugby in high school
for a few weeks to impress a girl.

30:28.901 --> 30:33.691
After ending on the bottom of a few
scrums, I rethought the relationship.

30:37.797 --> 30:42.947
Jeanie, you're a great P.A.
You're an asset to the ER.

30:43.078 --> 30:46.045
- But?
- But nothing.

30:46.214 --> 30:47.807
I think you should stay.

30:48.294 --> 30:50.530
And do my job, not do clerical work?

30:50.726 --> 30:54.206
Yeah, within the limits
that we set earlier.

30:54.406 --> 30:57.537
But you still wouldn't want me
suturing your daughter.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.654
I don't know.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.995
Okay.

31:14.918 --> 31:16.511
Good as new.

31:16.678 --> 31:22.493
When I caught up with him, he'd become
the mascot of the childrens' ward.

31:22.694 --> 31:24.603
Thank you. Good catch.

31:24.806 --> 31:27.326
All right, now,
I am on my way home.

31:27.525 --> 31:34.171
For a holiday with mu shu pork,
Channel 11, yule log and my chair.

31:34.949 --> 31:37.218
- How's your forehead?
- Jeanie fixed me right up.

31:37.381 --> 31:39.618
Yeah, she's a great P.A.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.735
All right, my work here is done.
Merry Christmas.

31:48.806 --> 31:52.035
I'm sorry I lied to you, Mark.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.303
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:58.341 --> 32:02.018
- What happened here?
- Long story.

32:08.422 --> 32:11.717
I swallowed a bunch of pills
a few years ago.

32:11.877 --> 32:16.482
When I got back to work, people
either smothered me or ignored me.

32:18.182 --> 32:22.688
If we aren't friends,
maybe we should be.

32:24.486 --> 32:28.446
Well, I have a house full of crazy
relatives waiting for me.

32:29.669 --> 32:33.346
- Merry Christmas, Carol.
- Merry Christmas.

32:46.405 --> 32:47.812
Hey!

32:48.965 --> 32:50.143
Hey!

32:51.462 --> 32:55.040
What are you doing?

32:55.206 --> 32:58.304
How did you find out where I live?

32:59.462 --> 33:01.796
I thought I lost this.

33:02.694 --> 33:06.076
- You did, at the cafeteria.
- And the 50-odd bucks that was in it?

33:06.245 --> 33:09.027
- I needed cab fair.
- 50 bucks worth?

33:09.189 --> 33:12.037
- What are you doing here?
- Gloria's pissed and blames it on me.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.849
- I can't stay there anymore.
- And?

33:15.014 --> 33:16.443
I thought I could crash with you.

33:17.190 --> 33:20.288
You're 14 years old, you stole
my wallet and you've been a pain.

33:20.453 --> 33:23.836
- You want me to stay on the streets?
- In a shelter.

33:23.974 --> 33:26.691
Shelter on Christmas Eve?

33:26.854 --> 33:28.130
Sounds like fun.

33:45.573 --> 33:47.712
Hi. How did you find me?

33:47.877 --> 33:50.146
Dr. Weaver told me
you were taking a break.

33:50.309 --> 33:53.157
I...

33:53.318 --> 33:55.423
I got a lot of Christmas cards...

33:55.557 --> 34:01.154
...for Mr. And Mrs. Al Boulet. I
thought you might want to look at them.

34:03.237 --> 34:05.659
You can sit down. I don't bite.

34:11.654 --> 34:15.844
Aunt Nonni. What get-rich-quick
scheme is she considering this year?

34:17.092 --> 34:19.460
Southwestern land development.

34:19.621 --> 34:22.174
- Beats the envelope-stuffing scheme.
- And the roller disco.

34:30.150 --> 34:35.485
I also thought
you might like to have this.

34:38.438 --> 34:40.510
Where did you find this?

34:40.677 --> 34:44.801
I finally got a chance to go through
some of the boxes in the house.

34:44.966 --> 34:48.195
I found my socket set, too.

34:48.357 --> 34:51.007
Remember that ridiculous tree
in the old apartment?

34:51.174 --> 34:54.882
There was nothing ridiculous about it.
It was a prime piece of pine.

34:55.045 --> 34:58.526
It was about 6 feet too tall
for a studio apartment.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.963
- And you refused to cut the top off.
- That would have been sacrilege.

35:01.126 --> 35:02.500
The stucco scratches are still there.

35:02.661 --> 35:06.589
You ate all the popcorn before I
could string it with the cranberries.

35:06.790 --> 35:08.448
- That's different.
- How?

35:08.645 --> 35:10.817
Because you know
how I feel about popcorn.

35:14.533 --> 35:17.795
Hey, Dennis!

35:22.629 --> 35:26.207
Dennis. You're sleeping.

35:26.373 --> 35:28.828
- No, I was just resting my eyes.
- What are you still doing here?

35:28.997 --> 35:30.819
- I've got all these charts.
- They can wait.

35:30.949 --> 35:32.443
No, I want to finish them up.

35:32.614 --> 35:36.411
- You are gonna get some sleep?
- Yeah, absolutely.

35:37.829 --> 35:39.902
I'm good.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.587
All right, man.

36:10.150 --> 36:13.346
Hey, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

36:13.894 --> 36:19.458
Well, actually I was just seducing
this fat man in a fly red suit...

36:19.621 --> 36:22.687
...who came down the chimney,
but other than that...

36:23.717 --> 36:27.940
Here, I brought this poinsettia.

36:28.742 --> 36:33.281
Who knew the Zippy Mart
was still open on Christmas Eve?

36:33.413 --> 36:38.596
Busted. I just didn't want
to show up here empty-handed.

36:52.261 --> 36:54.268
Thank you.

36:55.397 --> 36:59.904
- For the poinsettia.
- Yeah. Well, you're welcome.

37:01.957 --> 37:05.569
Are you gonna come in, or are you
gonna let all this cold air in here?

37:12.517 --> 37:16.860
- You forgot the extra chair.
- I borrowed some from next door.

37:17.061 --> 37:19.483
The extra chair
is for the unexpected guest.

37:19.685 --> 37:22.849
A tradition much older than you or me
or the guy next door.

37:23.014 --> 37:26.843
There is no room. And as much as I'd
like to sit on Uncle Nico's lap...

37:27.013 --> 37:29.184
Fine, fine. Have it your way.

37:29.349 --> 37:32.383
First we have to have <i>sviat vecher</i>
on American Christmas Eve.

37:32.549 --> 37:35.070
Then it's like pulling teeth to get
you to help me to cook.

37:35.238 --> 37:38.172
Now, one last tradition
I ask you to assist me with.

37:38.309 --> 37:40.676
And...

37:42.437 --> 37:45.666
- An unexpected guest, maybe?
- Maybe.

37:48.293 --> 37:50.944
- Hey.
- Don't say a word.

37:51.109 --> 37:53.662
Weren't you planning
a quiet evening with Channel 9?

37:53.830 --> 37:57.953
The plan's changed.

37:58.117 --> 38:01.762
- You're kidding me?
- She came to my place and can't stay.

38:01.925 --> 38:03.780
It wouldn't look very good, so...

38:03.941 --> 38:06.046
No. No way, Doug.

38:06.214 --> 38:10.621
It's bad enough. I've got drunken
dancers reenacting the purge in here.

38:10.758 --> 38:15.875
- It's Christmas, Carol.
- Doug, I am painfully aware of that.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.672
Come on. Come on, Nick.

38:47.429 --> 38:50.746
Nick, let's get out of here.
Come on, buddy.

38:50.949 --> 38:53.796
Come on.

38:54.629 --> 38:58.622
Mark!
I didn't hear you ring the bell.

38:58.789 --> 39:01.211
Jennifer, guess who's here?

39:01.381 --> 39:04.065
You won't believe
what he's got with him either.

39:04.229 --> 39:09.412
I got Rachel Labrador puppies for
Christmas, and here you are with...

39:09.574 --> 39:13.403
- What is he, some kind of a setter?
- Mixed breed.

39:13.541 --> 39:16.356
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

39:20.517 --> 39:24.347
- We thought you'd come tomorrow.
- Yeah, well...

39:24.549 --> 39:28.542
- Daddy, you brought me a doggy.
- Great minds think alike.

39:30.438 --> 39:34.977
Actually, he's my dog,
and I just wanted you to meet him.

39:35.141 --> 39:38.043
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Are you okay?

39:38.213 --> 39:42.523
- Bad dog!
- The doggy didn't mean it.

39:42.693 --> 39:45.890
- Let me take a look.
- Has he had his shots yet?

39:46.949 --> 39:50.178
Craig, let Mark take a look at it.
He's a doctor.

39:50.341 --> 39:52.960
- Come on in, Mark.
- Okay, let's go.

40:08.229 --> 40:12.539
Had I known she'd distract Mom,
I'd have invited her a long time ago.

40:12.709 --> 40:16.703
- So can she stay tonight?
- No, I don't think it's a good idea.

40:16.869 --> 40:19.586
- That's nice.
- You should make one. It's cool.

40:19.717 --> 40:21.757
I don't know, Charlie.
I'm no Picasso.

40:22.117 --> 40:23.939
- You chicken?
- Yeah, are you a chicken?

40:24.101 --> 40:26.140
Yeah, I'm a chicken.
Get over there, I'll paint it.

40:29.381 --> 40:33.342
Okay, one night.
Just one. Tonight.

40:33.509 --> 40:35.778
<i>- As long as we have hands to clasp.</i>

40:35.941 --> 40:41.473
<i>Christmas Day will always be</i>
<i>just as long as we have we.</i>

40:41.637 --> 40:44.735
<i>Welcome Christmas while we stand...</i>

40:44.901 --> 40:49.156
- I'm never gonna get sick of that.
- Do they have Dr. Seuss in Pakistan?

40:49.285 --> 40:51.968
I don't think it's a priority.

40:52.133 --> 40:55.963
- Will you be safe?
- You can't guarantee safety anywhere.

40:56.133 --> 40:59.068
I feel safe here.

40:59.269 --> 41:03.491
My father used to read the
Christmas story every Christmas Eve.

41:03.685 --> 41:06.587
I'm so tired,
I don't even think I remember it.

41:07.653 --> 41:12.509
- 'Twas the night before Christmas...
- And all through the house...

41:12.677 --> 41:16.539
- Not a creature was stirring...
- Not even a mouse.

41:16.805 --> 41:20.798
- I'm gonna miss you.
- That's not the next line.

41:20.933 --> 41:23.781
I'm really going to miss you.

41:49.285 --> 41:51.838
- What are you looking at?
- This tree.

41:52.005 --> 41:54.493
It's missing something, you know?

41:54.629 --> 41:58.274
Yeah, well Pedes did a good job with
the construction paper chain, huh?

41:58.437 --> 42:00.062
Yeah.

42:01.605 --> 42:03.994
That was a real gutsy thing
you did today.

42:04.197 --> 42:06.051
Thanks.

42:08.005 --> 42:11.387
You know, I have just the thing.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.309
It looks good.

42:25.445 --> 42:28.707
- Where did you get it?
- My ex-husband brought it by.

42:28.869 --> 42:31.487
- It came off our first Christmas tree.
- That's an heirloom.

42:31.653 --> 42:33.987
You should put it on your family tree.

42:34.181 --> 42:36.515
I just did.
