16:55.419 --> 16:57.552
STARFIRE!

16:57.554 --> 16:59.086
I COULD USE A HAND.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.465
SO, DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY

17:12.467 --> 17:14.133
HAVE A PLAN?

17:14.135 --> 17:16.068
YES, WE KICK THE BUTT.

17:16.070 --> 17:17.436

QUICK!

18:01.246 --> 18:02.411
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

18:02.413 --> 18:03.412
NOW'S THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE

18:03.414 --> 18:04.746
PROBABLY THINKING, "I SHOULDN'T

18:04.748 --> 18:05.580
HAVE HOOKED UP WITH THESE

18:05.582 --> 18:07.014
BROTHERHOOD GUYS."

18:07.016 --> 18:08.915
HATE TO SAY IT, BUT TOLD YA!

18:08.917 --> 18:10.216
UH!

18:10.218 --> 18:10.916
SORRY I'M LATE.

18:10.918 --> 18:12.984
I HAD TO PICK UP A FRIEND.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.085
YOU'RE WITH HIM?

18:15.087 --> 18:16.252
TRAITOR!

18:16.254 --> 18:17.086
YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME

18:17.088 --> 18:19.588
CATCHING UP TO DO.

18:19.590 --> 18:22.591
NOTHING PERSONAL.

18:22.593 --> 18:24.192
NOW, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.900
I HAVE DEFEATED YOU.

18:32.902 --> 18:34.534
I AM HONOR BOUND TO CLAIM

18:34.536 --> 18:35.968
MY PRIZE!

18:42.275 --> 18:44.108
WOO!

18:53.252 --> 18:54.751
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS

18:54.753 --> 18:56.419
GETTING EASIER?

18:56.421 --> 18:58.254
CHILDREN, WHEN WILL

18:58.256 --> 18:59.054
YOU LEARN?

18:59.056 --> 19:00.255
UH!

19:00.257 --> 19:01.356
LIKE I SAID...

19:06.295 --> 19:07.594
OOPS!

19:07.596 --> 19:08.962
DID I DO THAT?

19:15.836 --> 19:18.603
MASTER, IT IS TIME WE LEFT.

19:18.605 --> 19:20.004
AGREED.

19:25.611 --> 19:28.311
NO ONE'S LEAVING.

19:28.313 --> 19:32.447
THEN YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE.

19:32.449 --> 19:35.283
A LITTLE SOMETHING TO KEEP THEM

19:35.285 --> 19:39.286
BUSY PERHAPS.

19:39.288 --> 19:41.288
OH, MAN, AND JUST WHEN THIS

19:41.290 --> 19:42.822
WAS STARTING TO GET FUN.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.896
HE IS NOT GETTING AWAY.

20:02.709 --> 20:06.443
IT'S OVER, BRAIN.

20:06.445 --> 20:08.511
ISN'T THAT OBVIOUS.

20:08.513 --> 20:10.312
DUH.

20:10.314 --> 20:12.847
SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO WIN

20:12.849 --> 20:16.483
IS TO CLEAR THESE 4 COMPLETELY.

20:16.485 --> 20:20.520
IN ONLY A MOMENT, THIS ENTIRE

20:20.522 --> 20:23.289
BASE WILL BE GONE.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.390
IT'S A FUSION DEVICE,

20:24.392 --> 20:25.524
AND A BIG ONE.

20:25.526 --> 20:26.358
I HAVE NO IDEA

20:26.360 --> 20:27.559
HOW TO SHUT IT DOWN.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.693
WE NEED A MIRACLE.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.996
NO, WE NEED A FRIEND.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.631
I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE SIMPLY

20:34.633 --> 20:37.300

20:45.075 --> 20:46.140
CAW!

20:52.480 --> 20:54.379
MASTER, NO!

21:05.391 --> 21:07.491

21:07.493 --> 21:09.326
FAR AWAY WOULD BE GOOD.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.241
BEAST BOY!

21:36.553 --> 21:38.553

21:38.555 --> 21:39.854
SMART, BRINGING ALL THESE GUYS

21:39.856 --> 21:42.623
TOGETHER WAS PRETTY STUPID.

21:42.625 --> 21:46.893

22:16.615 --> 22:18.047
SURPRISE ME.

22:22.753 --> 22:24.419
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO SHOW HIM

22:24.421 --> 22:25.753
WHO HE'S UP AGAINST.

22:25.755 --> 22:27.588
