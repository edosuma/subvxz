WEBVTT

00:11.185 --> 00:12.327
- Ah.  - Ah.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.843
- Dany. - Hey.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.315
You go to school here?

00:17.820 --> 00:19.683
Yeah, you know I left Sherwood.

00:19.868 --> 00:21.305
Right, but I just didn't know where

00:21.724 --> 00:25.251
I mean, isn't this school feel like really talented kids

00:27.066 --> 00:30.492
- Eh, I did not mean. - No, no, keep talking. You are doing great.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.017
- Sorry. - It's, it's cool.

00:33.329 --> 00:34.702
So when did you get in for performing?

00:34.886 --> 00:37.731
Oh, see, my sister's tongue got all big and swollen and

00:38.812 --> 00:39.804
Here I am.

00:42.204 --> 00:43.171
So who's that?

00:43.996 --> 00:45.603
Eh, this is Dave.

00:45.830 --> 00:46.926
- Hey.  - What's up.

00:47.366 --> 00:48.675
Why you talking to Tori?

00:50.502 --> 00:51.769
He goes to my old school.

00:52.081 --> 00:52.640
Sherwood.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.286
He...

00:54.897 --> 00:57.507
- He was my boyfriend.  - Girlfriend.

00:57.798 --> 00:58.952
So why you dumped her?

01:00.742 --> 01:03.950
- Jade.  - Can I guess? Cause I got a lot of guessings.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.183
- I am actually.. - You don't have to

01:07.248 --> 01:09.539
- Tori broke up with me.  - Oh.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.481
And how did you celebrate?

01:12.881 --> 01:13.986
Do you ever take a day off?

01:15.052 --> 01:16.878
So, what you doing here?

01:17.190 --> 01:18.329
Yeah, what are you doing here?

01:18.705 --> 01:21.102
Well, I've kind of been dating this girl that you know, goes to

01:21.521 --> 01:23.215
And I as supposed to meet her...

01:24.314 --> 01:26.286
- Daniel  - Ben.

01:31.479 --> 01:35.651
This is the guy I've been telling you about. My boyfriend.

01:36.412 --> 01:37.052
Oww.

01:38.938 --> 01:42.430
Daniel, these are my friend. Beck, Jade, and that's Tori.

01:42.431 --> 01:44.121
Yeah, we've met.

01:45.054 --> 01:46.425
Really? You know Daniel?

01:46.545 --> 01:48.414
Oh, she knows Daniel.

01:51.972 --> 01:55.427
here I am, once again

01:55.441 --> 01:58.676
feeling lost but now and then

01:58.677 --> 02:02.937
I breath it in to let it go.

02:03.661 --> 02:06.901
And you don't know where you are now.

02:06.922 --> 02:11.733
What it would come to if only somebody would hear.

02:11.754 --> 02:13.909
When you figure out how

02:13.930 --> 02:18.891
You're lost in the moment you disappear

02:19.055 --> 02:22.742
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.285
You're never gonna fade, you'll be the main attraction.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.341
Not a fantasy

02:28.362 --> 02:29.727
Just remember me,

02:29.728 --> 02:32.341
when it turns out right.

02:32.362 --> 02:36.744
Cause you know that if you live in your imagination.

02:36.745 --> 02:40.291
Tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.876
In my victory, just remember me.

02:44.010 --> 02:50.229
When I make it shine.

02:55.549 --> 02:56.291
So,

02:57.308 --> 02:58.446
So.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.172
So.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.303
How come everyone's being all weird?

03:03.304 --> 03:04.450
- I'll tell her.  - No, you won't.

03:06.435 --> 03:06.943
Cat.

03:07.313 --> 03:09.625
um, I used to go to sherwood

03:10.108 --> 03:13.273
with danny, before I came to school here.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.427
Oh, so you guys were friends?

03:16.102 --> 03:18.533
Yeah, they were good friends.

03:19.976 --> 03:21.401
I, I am confused.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.838
- Danny and I used to date.  - Uhh.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.598
Hey, why don't we walk over to some other location?

03:32.828 --> 03:35.609
Ok, wait, so you and Tori were like...

03:37.094 --> 03:40.003
- Girlfriend.  - Boyfriend.

03:40.636 --> 03:41.977
So.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.557
- Please don't feel weird about this. - You really shouldn't.

03:45.578 --> 03:46.896
I mean, we broke up a year ago.

03:46.929 --> 03:47.911
Yeah, it's, it's been a year.

03:47.912 --> 03:48.813
It's only been eleven months.

03:48.814 --> 03:51.246
- What difference does it make? - Forget it.

03:51.289 --> 03:53.401
The point is, I'm totally cool with you guys dating.

03:53.564 --> 03:55.278
And I'm totally cool that you two are friends.

03:56.230 --> 03:59.633
Well, okay then. It's all happy.

04:00.864 --> 04:02.062
Yay.

04:02.396 --> 04:03.491
I'm bored now.

04:05.142 --> 04:06.499
I apologize for...

04:07.686 --> 04:08.206
...her.

04:12.337 --> 04:13.369
So how did you guys meet?

04:15.192 --> 04:16.440
Hey, do you guys want to go...

04:19.028 --> 04:19.661
Yeah.

04:20.464 --> 04:20.878
I

04:21.425 --> 04:21.880
Ok...

04:25.274 --> 04:25.930
Feel it.

04:28.721 --> 04:31.257
- Like a cloud. - It's like butter

04:31.258 --> 04:32.782
Yeah, I know.

04:33.009 --> 04:34.635
Doesn't my foot feel sweet?

04:34.636 --> 04:37.208
- Totally.  - Like a baby's butt, right?

04:39.849 --> 04:42.361
Oh, bye.

04:42.481 --> 04:43.817
Later guys.

04:45.617 --> 04:48.483
Uh, why were they all feeling your foot?

04:49.350 --> 04:52.942
I could explain it, but I'll just let the foot do the talking. Feel it.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.046
- What?  - Feel my foot.

04:55.047 --> 04:56.669
Feel the girl's foot, man.

04:57.342 --> 04:59.705
Ok, but I don't see the whole big deal about...

05:00.081 --> 05:01.539
Oh, smooth foot.

05:02.506 --> 05:04.825
I know.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.211
Wee.

05:06.588 --> 05:08.407
Man, that is some creamy foot.

05:10.064 --> 05:11.929
How'd you get your foot to feel like that?

05:12.113 --> 05:13.635
- Fish.  - Fish?

05:13.841 --> 05:15.470
Tiny, little fish.

05:17.745 --> 05:18.755
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:20.000 --> 05:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.985 --> 05:29.358
Ok.

05:30.268 --> 05:33.646
- You ready?  - No! I don't understand this at all.

05:33.980 --> 05:39.150
Ok, these are pooka fish from puerto iguazu, and they love the taste of dead human skin.

05:40.038 --> 05:41.590
Man, get me outta this house.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.401
How'd you get these?

05:45.734 --> 05:46.873
I know a guy.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.819
- Who deals in foot fish? - Yes.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.934
now, when you put your feet in the tank,

05:52.935 --> 05:57.497
the fish will nibble off all the dead foot skin and calluses, leaving your feet insanely soft and supple.

05:58.428 --> 05:59.587
Soft and supple.

06:01.722 --> 06:02.617
Fifty bucks.

06:03.164 --> 06:06.377
- Seems expensive. - You want gross, crunchy feet? Cuz girls don't dig that.

06:25.739 --> 06:29.049
- Feels good right?  - Yeah. It's like a million tiny kisses,

06:29.532 --> 06:31.033
on my feet!

06:46.726 --> 06:47.822
hey, can you pass the salt?

06:49.201 --> 06:50.018
Why should I?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.774
'Cuz my french fries aren't salty enough?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.676
Sorry to put you to that trouble

06:59.446 --> 07:00.511
Guess who?

07:01.315 --> 07:03.417
Eh, hehe.

07:03.686 --> 07:04.334
Is it Beck?

07:05.873 --> 07:06.638
What?

07:06.716 --> 07:08.495
I'm sitting right next to you.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.152
Oh, yeah. hey, beck.

07:10.873 --> 07:12.267
She's feeling my face.

07:13.054 --> 07:14.479
Uh, no. no, it's me.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.555
Daniel.

07:16.252 --> 07:17.381
What are you doing here?

07:17.382 --> 07:19.545
I had a half day. Thought I'd come visit you for lunch.

07:20.646 --> 07:25.710
Well, this is so nice. Daniel gets to have lunch with his new girlfriend

07:25.852 --> 07:27.791
and his used girlfriend.

07:28.595 --> 07:31.022
You know, you can try to make this awkward, but it's not gonna work,

07:31.121 --> 07:34.051
because unlike you, everyone at this table is mature.

07:35.366 --> 07:37.136
And by the way, I dumped him, so hah!

07:40.017 --> 07:42.349
Soooo, did you invite daniel to the kick-back?

07:42.498 --> 07:44.377
- Oh, my god, I forgot.  - Kickback?

07:44.668 --> 07:49.326
Once every semester, the school lets us have a saturday night party right here in the parking lot.

07:49.446 --> 07:52.611
- Live music, cheese fountain. - Cheese fountain?

07:53.052 --> 07:53.699
Cheddar.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.326
- Will you come?  - Yeah, totally.

07:57.702 --> 07:59.886
Tori, will you be at the kickback?

08:00.625 --> 08:02.169
Yes, Jade. I will be.

08:03.007 --> 08:05.539
- Ooh! guess what I made? - Ah, what'd you make?

08:06.705 --> 08:07.466
Brownies.

08:09.201 --> 08:12.046
Wow. Sorry. Danny doesn't like brownies.

08:13.351 --> 08:15.033
Everyone likes brownies.

08:15.302 --> 08:16.433
- Open.  - Uh, yeah

08:20.337 --> 08:20.835
Wow.

08:23.046 --> 08:23.909
These are really good.

08:24.598 --> 08:25.187
What?

08:25.631 --> 08:28.089
He said cat's brownie is really good.

08:29.647 --> 08:32.927
I made you brownies twice and you told me you didn't like brownies.

08:33.434 --> 08:35.342
Yeah, but cat's are...

08:36.592 --> 08:37.270
...different.

08:37.270 --> 08:41.145
- Different how? What do you mean, different?  - Tori.

08:45.062 --> 08:45.625
How was it.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.077
I gotta go.

08:52.288 --> 08:53.862
These are really good.

08:56.042 --> 08:57.567
It's like a baby's butt.

08:59.140 --> 08:59.790
I know.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.780
- You guys ever felt a foot that soft?  - Never.

09:04.881 --> 09:06.223
That is a quality foot.

09:10.485 --> 09:12.661
All right. See you guys later. Have a good class.

09:14.486 --> 09:17.240
Uh, how come all those people were rubbing on your foot?

09:17.912 --> 09:19.125
See for yourself.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.297
- Uhh?  - Feel it.

09:23.804 --> 09:24.452
Come on.

09:25.519 --> 09:26.452
Andre, come on.

09:30.993 --> 09:32.682
dang, man, that's smooth.

09:34.749 --> 09:35.246
Right?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.251
Yeah. How'd you get it so soft?

09:37.948 --> 09:39.342
- You wanna know?  - Yeah.

09:40.060 --> 09:40.814
You wanna know?

09:40.934 --> 09:41.902
Yeah.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.241
- Andre?  - Yeah!!

09:49.553 --> 09:51.044
Y'all are serious?

09:52.455 --> 09:53.294
Oh yeah.

09:53.713 --> 09:54.937
- Do it.  - Do it.

09:55.441 --> 09:56.636
Do it.

10:13.554 --> 10:14.702
Yeah, boy.

10:17.046 --> 10:18.574
Awesome, right?

10:18.737 --> 10:22.653
Yeah. It's like my feet are getting million times kisses.

10:23.932 --> 10:26.178
All right. Yeah, get 'em little fishy.

10:27.883 --> 10:31.030
Chew them up. Whoo! All right.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.971
Hey, sikowitz.

10:55.985 --> 10:57.187
Tori.

10:57.628 --> 11:00.430
How are you enjoying your first hollywood arts kick-back?

11:00.892 --> 11:01.923
It's really fun.

11:03.068 --> 11:04.293
Would you like a sausage?

11:05.180 --> 11:07.086
Uh, sure. okay.

11:07.398 --> 11:08.110
Excellent.

11:08.913 --> 11:10.777
Here's a nice fat one.

11:11.388 --> 11:13.294
I'll just impale it with this stick.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.099
- Here you go.  - Thanks.

11:22.822 --> 11:24.230
What kind of sausage is this?

11:24.849 --> 11:25.561
Oh.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.409
Just sausage.

11:27.968 --> 11:28.984
You know.

11:30.378 --> 11:32.542
Yeah, but what kind of meat does it made of?

12:02.593 --> 12:04.622
Daniel ever spin you like that?

12:05.707 --> 12:07.298
You wanna get slapped with a sausage?

12:08.710 --> 12:09.589
Sure.

12:10.232 --> 12:11.528
No.

12:15.954 --> 12:17.511
Nice foot, dude.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.254
Yeah, I know.

12:18.289 --> 12:19.747
Doesn't my foot feel sweet?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.789
Like a baby's butt, right?

12:24.791 --> 12:27.193
Jade, Jade. You gotta come feel andre's foot.

12:27.528 --> 12:29.027
Why would I wanna feel

12:29.553 --> 12:30.118
All right.

12:33.222 --> 12:34.527
Dang, dude.

12:35.283 --> 12:36.985
That's some soft footage.

12:37.062 --> 12:38.430
That's what I said.

12:38.562 --> 12:40.692
I mean really, let's be serious here.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.837
- That's a nice foot.  - Right? I know.

12:46.364 --> 12:47.097
Hey, Tori.

12:47.686 --> 12:49.774
- Hey, pretty thang. - Oh hush, Rex.

12:51.119 --> 12:53.689
Uh, have you tried the hot cheese fountain?

12:54.129 --> 12:54.905
No.

12:55.281 --> 12:56.448
They have a hot cheese fountain.

12:57.038 --> 12:57.809
Ok.

13:23.744 --> 13:25.564
What the hairballs?

13:27.558 --> 13:29.443
You got cheese in our hair!

13:29.761 --> 13:30.957
Tori.

13:31.804 --> 13:33.219
Why did you do that?

13:34.897 --> 13:37.337
I, I, I don't know. I, I just...

13:42.614 --> 13:43.374
You see.

13:44.106 --> 13:48.707
This is what happens when you mix teenagers and hot cheese.

13:50.647 --> 13:51.673
I warned you.

14:02.289 --> 14:03.491
Tori.

14:04.465 --> 14:05.369
Yo Tori.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.438
We saw you run in here.

14:08.582 --> 14:09.778
What's with all that stuff?

14:10.304 --> 14:13.433
Sinjin and his friends are doing some play about a camping trip gone wrong.

14:13.702 --> 14:16.025
- Gone wrong?  - They end up eating each other, I don't know

14:18.417 --> 14:19.235
Tori.

14:20.636 --> 14:21.582
Tori.

14:22.534 --> 14:23.801
Yo Tori.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.518
Oww.

14:32.945 --> 14:33.961
Tori.

14:34.886 --> 14:38.076
Come out to play.

14:39.814 --> 14:41.017
Leave me alone.

14:42.322 --> 14:44.259
What up with the hot cheese attack on cat?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.499
And her boyfriend, Daniel.

14:49.224 --> 14:50.289
I don't know.

14:50.568 --> 14:54.414
I mean, I'm so not the jealous type. I've never ever done anything like that before.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.614
But seeing my ex-boyfriend making out with cat, I guess I just--

14:58.182 --> 15:01.262
I just lost it for a second and the next thing I knew, my hand was on the cheese-valve.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.307
Oh.

15:04.262 --> 15:05.785
I have to go apologize to them.

15:14.045 --> 15:15.619
You wanna go feel Andre's foot some more?

15:16.998 --> 15:17.749
Yeah.

15:34.150 --> 15:34.816
Danny.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.171
- Hi.  - Where's Cat?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.859
Oh, she's still trying to get cheese out of her ear.

15:42.981 --> 15:43.915
Oh...

15:44.902 --> 15:46.041
All right, listen.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.635
I have no idea why I did that.

15:48.636 --> 15:49.603
Were you jealous?

15:49.937 --> 15:53.998
- No.  - 'Cuz it doesn't make sense for you to be jealous. You broke up with me.

15:54.481 --> 15:55.193
I know.

15:55.569 --> 15:56.750
It makes zero sense.

16:00.293 --> 16:04.277
Guess it's just a dumb girl thing.

16:04.408 --> 16:05.096
Like...

16:06.129 --> 16:08.782
- wearing a skirt over jeans?  - Yeah, what's up with that?

16:12.060 --> 16:14.917
I mean, are you maybe still into me?

16:15.540 --> 16:16.408
No.

16:16.902 --> 16:20.003
Not at all. And I love cat. She's like the sweetest thing ever and...

16:20.380 --> 16:21.923
...I'm psyched you guys are going out.

16:23.793 --> 16:25.145
I guess it's , it's just...

16:41.229 --> 16:42.147
No.

16:49.969 --> 16:52.067
- Cat.  - Oh my god. Cat!

16:53.446 --> 16:57.230
Hey, do either of you guys know what kind of meat sikowitz uses in this sausuage?

16:57.607 --> 16:59.427
I asked him and he just started laughing like...

17:03.690 --> 17:04.198
Bye.

17:18.001 --> 17:19.267
You sure this is safe?

17:19.537 --> 17:20.290
We all did it.

17:21.137 --> 17:22.592
- Does it hurt?  - Nope.

17:22.805 --> 17:23.329
Oww.

17:25.117 --> 17:27.587
C'mon, if you want your feet to feel all baby soft.

17:28.049 --> 17:28.707
Ok.

17:29.905 --> 17:33.283
I have left her 5 Voicemails and sent her 12 text messages.

17:33.489 --> 17:34.969
Why won't cat talk to me?

17:34.970 --> 17:37.209
'Cuz you squirted hot cheese in her ear.

17:37.904 --> 17:39.903
And played smushy-face with her boyfriend.

17:40.003 --> 17:43.054
Those things upset some girls.

17:43.686 --> 17:45.123
You wanna try the pooka fish?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.559
Ya got rice and soy sauce?

17:46.581 --> 17:47.707
- No.  - Then no.

17:51.134 --> 17:52.526
okay, guys. do it.

17:52.860 --> 17:53.763
Do it.

17:54.182 --> 17:55.266
Doooo iiiit.

18:10.365 --> 18:11.037
See?

18:11.038 --> 18:12.315
It feels good, right?

18:12.316 --> 18:15.310
- Yeah, it feels...  - It's kind of like...

18:16.177 --> 18:19.491
Like a million tiny fish kisses

18:20.060 --> 18:22.727
Yeeaaahhhh.

18:38.620 --> 18:39.359
Cat.

18:39.941 --> 18:41.218
I just wanna talk to you!

18:41.219 --> 18:45.354
No! No! Get away from me! No!

18:46.170 --> 18:48.252
Whoa, stop it! no!

18:49.268 --> 18:51.252
- Got you.  - Let go.

18:51.253 --> 18:53.987
- No! We have to go talk! - I don't wanna talk to you!

18:57.052 --> 18:58.563
- Cat!  - I don't wanna get up!

18:58.564 --> 19:00.415
- C'mon cat!  - Help, I need a teacher.

19:00.437 --> 19:03.743
Please, teacher...

19:03.744 --> 19:07.482
Hello, girls. Can you believe I scored tickets to hall and oates?

19:09.778 --> 19:10.478
All right.

19:12.326 --> 19:13.991
- Here we go. - Oh, god. Tori.

19:14.024 --> 19:15.327
This way. Almost there.

19:17.779 --> 19:19.914
Will you stop this from happening?

19:19.935 --> 19:21.713
Oh, it's okay. She enjoys this.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.433
- Let me out!  - Cat.

19:26.434 --> 19:27.715
This is kidnapping.

19:28.241 --> 19:29.335
Or cat-napping.

19:31.868 --> 19:33.113
Open the door.

19:33.980 --> 19:34.990
I'm sorry.

19:35.281 --> 19:39.214
And I'm not just saying I'm sorry, I'm really, really, seriously sorry.

19:40.636 --> 19:43.161
You sprayed cheese on me and then kissed my boyfriend.

19:44.924 --> 19:45.598
Yeah.

19:46.862 --> 19:47.726
Yeah I did.

19:48.614 --> 19:50.042
Why would you be mean to me?

19:51.260 --> 19:52.206
I don't know.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.897
Maybe I did still have a few tiny little feelings left for danny

19:56.550 --> 19:58.137
and maybe that's why I went a little crazy

19:58.982 --> 20:00.974
seeing you two being all mushy together.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.897
You coulda just talked to me about it.

20:04.358 --> 20:05.262
I know.

20:05.745 --> 20:10.595
What I did was terrible and awful and immature and you have every right to be furious with me.

20:11.142 --> 20:13.539
I swear, cat, if I were you, I'd just punch me right in the face

20:14.854 --> 20:15.731
Ow.

20:17.109 --> 20:18.211
Cat!

20:19.036 --> 20:19.371
What?

20:20.781 --> 20:22.393
You just punch me in the face.

20:22.790 --> 20:23.545
You said to.

20:24.569 --> 20:27.453
I know, but that's just something people say...Oww!

20:28.585 --> 20:29.689
Does it hurt?

20:29.766 --> 20:30.585
A lot!

20:31.782 --> 20:33.763
I think my nose may be broken.

20:34.332 --> 20:35.833
Well, now I feel all bad.

20:36.828 --> 20:39.011
Don't. I deserved it!

20:40.193 --> 20:41.093
Feel better?

20:42.143 --> 20:42.894
I think so.

20:44.401 --> 20:45.347
I'm sorry.

20:52.657 --> 20:54.201
Will you take me to a hospital now?

20:54.685 --> 20:55.636
Sure.

20:56.079 --> 20:56.898
Thank you.

21:03.601 --> 21:04.505
Was it broken?

21:04.881 --> 21:07.257
Don't think so. Just bruised.

21:08.102 --> 21:08.985
How this happened?

21:10.641 --> 21:13.379
I..um..fell

21:13.756 --> 21:14.766
On what?

21:15.569 --> 21:17.424
Something...hard.

21:19.729 --> 21:20.636
Like a rock.

21:23.047 --> 21:23.513
Wow.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.094
We should get you x-rayed.

21:26.342 --> 21:28.014
- Take a seat over there. - Thank you.

21:31.047 --> 21:31.719
What?

21:35.452 --> 21:37.315
- Oh my god!  - What?

21:41.962 --> 21:45.763
Wow, you all look awful.

21:45.926 --> 21:46.787
What happened?

21:47.164 --> 21:48.153
Ask your sister.

21:50.868 --> 21:51.934
Eww.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.949
It seems they all have myroleticulitis,

21:54.950 --> 21:58.851
an infectious attack on the central nervous system that can be very dangerous

21:58.852 --> 22:00.078
Unless treated immediately.

22:00.390 --> 22:01.230
How'd they get it?

22:01.436 --> 22:03.577
I have no idea. It's very rare in America.

22:05.638 --> 22:09.870
Have any of you recently gone swimming in the zingu river near puerto iguazu?

22:12.689 --> 22:13.475
Trina.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.049
- What?  - Tell him.

22:17.628 --> 22:23.075
Ok, I bought some illegal pooka fish from a guy in a van.

22:24.378 --> 22:25.614
Pooka fish?

22:25.990 --> 22:27.524
For feet smoothening?

22:28.837 --> 22:29.923
Yeah.

22:30.364 --> 22:31.843
Do you know how dangerous that is?

22:32.454 --> 22:35.747
The saliva of the pooka fish is riddled with toxins and bacteria.

22:35.953 --> 22:36.942
But feel our feet.

22:38.542 --> 22:41.721
Yes, I realize that they can nibble away all of the

22:42.780 --> 22:44.729
Wow, they are very soft.

22:46.556 --> 22:48.505
Nurses, feel these kids' feet.

22:48.904 --> 22:49.904
Everyone.

22:50.399 --> 22:53.214
- Oh. ow, wow. that's nice. - That's like a baby's bottom.
