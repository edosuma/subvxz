09:50.200 --> 09:51.867

TO MAKE IT UP TO HIM

09:51.867 --> 09:53.500

UNDERSTAND, ALAN.

BECAUSE I ONCE ABROGATED
MY RESPONSIBILITY

10:32.700 --> 10:33.900
TO IMPART KNOWLEDGE?

10:37.700 --> 10:40.100
I'VE GOT TO LISTEN
TO THIS EVERY DAY.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.834
HOUSE.

10:42.834 --> 10:43.900
GONE.

10:45.567 --> 10:46.734
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

10:46.734 --> 10:49.400
WHY YOU'RE MAKING
A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF THIS.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.000
MAYBE IF YOU WERE
ENTRUSTED

10:51.000 --> 10:52.133
WITH THE EDUCATION

10:52.133 --> 10:54.467
OF 32 SIXTH-GRADERS
EVERY DAY,

10:54.467 --> 10:56.500
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.033
AND MAYBE IF YOU HAD A SON

10:58.033 --> 11:00.200
AND WERE TRYING TO FIND TIME
TO SPEND WITH HIM

11:00.200 --> 11:01.467
IN BETWEEN YOUR JOB,

11:01.467 --> 11:03.300
AND FIXING THE CAR,
AND INSULATING THE ATTIC,

11:03.300 --> 11:05.367
<i>YOU'D </i>UNDERSTAND
WHAT <i>I'M </i>TALKING ABOUT.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.200
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
A SON, GEORGE,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.767
SO HOW COULD YOU
UNDERSTAND?

11:09.767 --> 11:11.200
[SIGHS]

11:11.200 --> 11:13.400
WELL,
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY

11:13.400 --> 11:16.100
ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE FENCE HERE.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.133
YES, WE ARE.

11:18.133 --> 11:20.767
NOW, THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.133
AW, DAD.
YOU GOT FEENED.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.000
AH, THE CONQUERING
HEROES RETURN.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.500
HOW DID YOU DO?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.400
[WHISTLES]

11:36.400 --> 11:37.467
[BOOM]

11:37.467 --> 11:40.000
IT WAS A VERY
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.800
'CAUSE FEENY'S A BUTT.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.667
HEY, YOU DON'T CALL
YOUR TEACHER THAT.

11:43.667 --> 11:46.100
GOOD TEACHERS ARE A RARE
COMMODITY IN THIS WORLD,

11:46.100 --> 11:48.367
AND GEORGE FEENY
IS A GREAT TEACHER.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.100
WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS

11:50.100 --> 11:51.567
AND GET SOME
TENNIS CLOTHES ON.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.233
WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE "Y",
HIT SOME BALLS.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.200
OK.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.567
FEENY'S A BUTT.

11:58.567 --> 11:59.867
ALAN.

11:59.867 --> 12:01.600
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
NO, YOU DON'T.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.000
OH, YES I DO.
YOU'RE GONNA SAY

12:04.000 --> 12:06.100
I'M A JERK FOR KEEPING
MY KID UP HALF THE NIGHT

12:06.100 --> 12:07.600
AND THEN TRYING TO WEASEL
HIS TEACHER

12:07.600 --> 12:10.000
INTO MAKING AN EXCEPTION
TO THE RULES.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.500
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.367
OK, WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY?

12:13.367 --> 12:14.700
FORKS GO
ON THE LEFT.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.500
THAT'S IT?
NO.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.233
I KNOW WHY YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID,

12:24.233 --> 12:25.400
AND I LOVE YOU

12:25.400 --> 12:28.133
FOR WANTING TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH CORY,

12:28.133 --> 12:30.834
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
JERK HIS LIFE AROUND

12:30.834 --> 12:33.000
TO--TO LET YOURSELF
OFF THE HOOK

12:33.000 --> 12:34.834
WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR HIM.

I'LL GET IT!

12:39.867 --> 12:41.500
MR. MATTHEWS?
LEONARD SPINELLI.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.834
I WORK FOR YOUR FATHER.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.467
I KNOW THAT, LENNY.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.200
I SEE YOU AT THE STORE
EVERY DAY.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.834
LOOK, YOU'RE
THE ASSISTANT MANAGER.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.100
I'M JUST A BOX BOY.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.500
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME ERIC?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.000
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
INTENSELY UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.133
I BLANCH AT THE THOUGHT.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.000
LENNY, WAS THERE SOMETHING
YOU HAD TO TELL MY DAD?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.934
YES, THERE WAS.
HENCE, I CAME HERE.

12:59.934 --> 13:01.500
HE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.400
OH, GOD!

13:07.767 --> 13:09.033
HELLO, LENNY.

13:09.033 --> 13:11.734
MR. MATTHEWS, I'M VERY SORRY
TO DISTURB YOU AT HOME,

13:11.734 --> 13:13.033
ESPECIALLY AFTER-HOURS.

13:13.033 --> 13:15.033

GIVING MRS. MATTHEWS

13:17.200 --> 13:19.367
WHY ARE YOU
IN MY KITCHEN?

13:19.367 --> 13:20.767
THERE'S A PROBLEM
AT THE STORE.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.767
WELL, OF COURSE THERE'S
A PROBLEM AT THE STORE.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.500
THERE'S ALWAYS
A PROBLEM AT THE STORE.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.900
THAT'S WHY THEY HIRE
A MANAGER.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.700
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THEY
HIRE AN ASSISTANT MANAGER?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.500
TO TELL THE MANAGER

13:31.500 --> 13:33.734
WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM
AT THE STORE?

13:33.734 --> 13:36.500
NO. TO ASSIST
THE MANAGER

13:36.500 --> 13:38.033
BY TAKING CARE
OF THE PROBLEM

13:38.033 --> 13:39.200
WHEN HE'S NOT THERE.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.400
I HAD NO IDEA.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.000
I APOLOGIZE.
FORGET I WAS HERE

13:43.000 --> 13:45.567
BECAUSE THIS IS A PROBLEM
FOR THE ASSISTANT MANAGER.

13:45.567 --> 13:46.967
THERE IS NO PROBLEM
FOR YOU.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.233

13:48.233 --> 13:49.467
YES, I AM.

13:49.467 --> 13:50.934
I'M READY TO PLAY
TENNIS WITH MY SON,

13:50.934 --> 13:52.200

HOME EARLY,

LET HIM GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST,

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
SEND HIM OFF TO SCHOOL,

13:54.700 --> 13:57.200
AND WATCH THOSE As
START ROLLING IN.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.667
AND I AM GOING
BACK TO THE STORE

13:58.667 --> 14:01.200
TO MAKE SURE WE NEVER AGAIN
PUT THE LIGHTER FLUID

14:01.200 --> 14:03.600
NEXT TO
THE ROTISSERIE CHICKENS.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.367
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A FIRE, LENNY?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.500
YEAH, BUT THERE IS
NO PROBLEM FOR YOU.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.400

IS LEFT?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.700
TO WAKE ME UP

WE'LL PLAY TENNIS
SOME OTHER TIME.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.467
IS THE FIRE OUT, LENNY?

14:20.467 --> 14:22.600
OH, YEAH. WE CONTAINED
THE ACTUAL FLAMEAGE.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.200

LENNY, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH THIS.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.667
CORY, YOUR MOTHER
JUST SAID SOMETHING TO ME

14:36.667 --> 14:38.567
THAT MADE
A LOT OF SENSE.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.834
DON'T YOU HATE
WHEN SHE DOES THAT?

14:40.834 --> 14:42.567
YES, I DO.

14:42.567 --> 14:44.700
SHE POINTED OUT TO ME
THAT I'M ANGRY

14:44.700 --> 14:47.033
AT THE WRONG GUY
ABOUT YOUR TEST.

14:47.033 --> 14:49.100
WELL, WHAT OTHER
GUY IS THERE?

14:49.100 --> 14:50.867
MR. FEENY'S THE ONE
WHO FAILED ME.

14:50.867 --> 14:53.500
NO, I FAILED YOU.
I DIDN'T DO MY JOB.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.967
YOU'RE AT THE STORE
ALL DAY.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.934
HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU'RE
NOT DOING YOUR JOB?

14:56.934 --> 14:59.200
I DIDN'T DO MY JOB
AS YOUR FATHER.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.300
WHAT?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.734
LOOK,
IF IT WAS UP TO ME,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.400
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO SLEEP AT ALL.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.600
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

15:04.600 --> 15:05.734
I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO GO TO WORK,

15:05.734 --> 15:07.900
AND WE COULD JUST SPEND
ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.000
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I'D RATHER DO.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.934
THEN WHY DON'T WE
DO THAT?

15:11.934 --> 15:13.133
I DON'T KNOW.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.367
I GUESS THE FAMILY'S
GOTTEN USED TO EATING.

15:16.367 --> 15:17.500
CORY...

15:17.500 --> 15:21.767
I SHOULDN'T HAVE KEPT
YOU UP LATE LAST NIGHT.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.867
MR. FEENY WAS RIGHT.

15:32.000 --> 15:32.967
UH-OH.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.033
DON'T SHOOT,
MR. FEENY!

15:46.033 --> 15:47.600
I'M JUST GETTING
MY TENNIS BALL!

15:47.600 --> 15:50.567
GOOD EVENING,
MR. MATTHEWS.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.500
CARE TO JOIN ME
FOR A DRINK?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.800
UH...SURE.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.467
HELP YOURSELF.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.100
HEY! THIS IS
APPLE JUICE!

16:27.100 --> 16:31.600
OH, GEE, I MUST'VE LEFT IT
IN THERE TOO LONG.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.900
NICE, UH...

16:32.900 --> 16:34.500
WHAT DO YOU CALL
THIS THING?

16:34.500 --> 16:37.734
HMM, A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
FROM MY SISTER.

16:37.734 --> 16:39.400
SHE FORGETS
THAT I ONLY TAKE

16:39.400 --> 16:42.734
THE OCCASIONAL GLASS
OF CLARET WITH DINNER.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.033
SO, HOW COME YOU'RE
SITTING OUTSIDE

16:45.033 --> 16:46.867
IN THE DARK?

16:46.867 --> 16:48.934
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

16:48.934 --> 16:51.400
JUST A LITTLE YOUNGER
THAN YOU ARE.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.867
THERE WAS A WAR
GOING ON.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.600
IT'S HARD TO PICTURE
YOU AS A BOY.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.800
DID YOUR PARENTS
CALL YOU MR. FEENY?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.567
I USED TO ASK MY MOTHER

17:03.567 --> 17:06.133
WHY I COULD ONLY HAVE
BUTTER ON MY TOAST

17:06.133 --> 17:07.300
2 MORNINGS A WEEK,

17:07.300 --> 17:09.734
AND SHE SAID, "BECAUSE OF
THE WAR IN EUROPE."

17:09.734 --> 17:12.800
AND I WONDERED WHY THERE WAS
NEVER ENOUGH CANDY,

17:12.800 --> 17:13.867
AND SHE TOLD ME,

17:13.867 --> 17:16.200
"BECAUSE OF THE WAR
IN EUROPE."

17:16.200 --> 17:19.300
OH, AND I LONGED
FOR A PAIR OF SNEAKERS.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.834
BUT I COULDN'T HAVE ANY.

17:20.834 --> 17:24.133
THOSE EUROPE GUYS
STOLE 'EM?

17:24.133 --> 17:27.700
NO, NO. THE RUBBER
HAD TO BE DIVERTED

17:27.700 --> 17:28.934
TO THE WAR EFFORT.

17:28.934 --> 17:30.900
THERE WAS A VERSION
OF A SNEAKER AVAILABLE,

17:30.900 --> 17:33.567
BUT IT WAS MADE
OUT OF RECYCLED TIRES,

17:33.567 --> 17:36.800
AND LEFT BLACK MARKS
ON THE GYM FLOOR.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.900
HEY, YOU TOOK GYM?

17:38.900 --> 17:40.834
THEY MADE ME.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.300
ANYWAY, I PRAYED
EVERY NIGHT

17:44.300 --> 17:46.100
FOR AN END TO THE WAR
IN EUROPE.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.934
NOT FROM ANY ALTRUISTIC
DESIRE FOR WORLD PEACE.

17:49.934 --> 17:52.367
JUST A BOY'S
SELFISH WISH

17:52.367 --> 17:55.033
FOR BUTTERED TOAST
AND SNEAKERS.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.567
THEN I HEARD
THAT MR. TRUMAN

17:57.567 --> 17:59.967
WAS GOING ON
THE RADIO THAT NIGHT

17:59.967 --> 18:01.934
TO ANNOUNCE THE END
OF THE WAR.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.900
AND I WENT HOME
AND ASKED MY FATHER

18:03.900 --> 18:08.300
IF I COULD STAY UP WITH HIM
TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.200
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAID?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.200
I'M GUESSING IT'S
EITHER YES OR NO,

18:12.200 --> 18:14.233
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
HOW WELL I DO

18:14.233 --> 18:15.667
ON MULTIPLE CHOICE.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.100
HE SAID...

18:19.100 --> 18:21.500
"TOMORROW'S
A SCHOOL DAY.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.734
I DON'T WANT YOU
UP WITH ME."

18:23.734 --> 18:27.100
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOUR DAD REALLY KNEW

18:27.100 --> 18:28.400
THE VALUE
OF EDUCATION.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.467
NO, I'M SAYING
MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT ME

18:30.467 --> 18:34.800
HANGING AROUND WITH HIM
AND HIS DRINKING BUDDIES.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.100
AS A RESULT,
THE NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL,

18:38.100 --> 18:41.500
I WAS RESTED AND FRESH
AND READY TO LEARN.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.867
I SEE YOUR POINT,
MR. FEENY.

18:43.867 --> 18:47.133
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY DO, CORY.

18:47.133 --> 18:48.567
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE

18:48.567 --> 18:50.900
I LEARNED IN SCHOOL
THAT DAY?

18:50.900 --> 18:54.200
I KNOW THIS HAS GOT
TO BE A BIGGIE,

18:54.200 --> 18:57.300
LIKE THE MAGNA CARTA
OR SOMETHING.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.400
I HAVE NO IDEA

18:58.400 --> 19:00.734
WHAT YOU LEARNED
THAT DAY.

19:00.734 --> 19:02.500
NEITHER DO I.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.767
YOU SEE, MR. MATTHEWS,

19:04.767 --> 19:08.133
EDUCATION IS NOT ABOUT
OBSCURE FACTS

19:08.133 --> 19:10.500
AND LITTLE TEST SCORES.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.000
EDUCATION IS ABOUT
THE OVERALL EFFECT

19:14.000 --> 19:16.867
OF YEARS OF
SLOW ABSORPTION,

19:16.867 --> 19:19.233
CONCEPTS, PHILOSOPHIES,

19:19.233 --> 19:22.567
APPROACHES
TO PROBLEM-SOLVING.

19:22.567 --> 19:25.233
THE WHOLE PROCESS
IS SO GRAND

19:25.233 --> 19:27.934
AND ALL-ENCOMPASSING

19:27.934 --> 19:29.900
THAT IT REALLY
CAN'T BE THREATENED

19:29.900 --> 19:33.233
BY THE OCCASIONAL
LATE-NIGHT NO-HITTER.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.400
IT IS IMPORTANT

19:37.400 --> 19:40.300
THAT A BOY SPEND TIME
WITH HIS FATHER.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.600
BUT...HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.734
YOUR DAD DIDN'T LET
YOU STAY UP WITH HIM.

19:44.734 --> 19:47.133
THAT'S PRECISELY
WHY I DO KNOW.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.200
Alan: CORY!

19:50.200 --> 19:51.367
OVER HERE, DAD,

19:51.367 --> 19:53.000
HAVING A DRINK
WITH MR. FEENY.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.200
IT'S JUST
APPLE JUICE.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.467
HOW'S THE STORE?

19:57.467 --> 19:58.500
OH, THE STORE IS FINE.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.934
JUST A SMALL GREASE FIRE
AT THE ROTISSERIE.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.667
TOMORROW WE'LL RUN
A SPECIAL

20:02.667 --> 20:04.700
ON BLACKENED CHICKEN.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.233
ALAN.
GEORGE.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.934
BETTER COME IN, KIDDO.
ABOUT TIME FOR BED.

20:08.934 --> 20:09.934
SURE, DAD.

20:09.934 --> 20:12.100
UM...ARE WE EVER
GONNA STUDY

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
THAT EUROPEAN
SNEAKER WAR?

20:14.100 --> 20:17.000
I THINK YOU'LL
GET TO IT SOMETIME

20:17.000 --> 20:18.600
IN THE COURSE
OF YOUR EDUCATION.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.100
GOOD,

20:20.100 --> 20:21.600
'CAUSE IT SOUNDED
REALLY INTERESTING.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.400
OH, IT WAS.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.000
WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
MR. FEENY.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.767
GOOD NIGHT,
MR. MATTHEWS.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.867
AHEM. I, UH...

20:34.867 --> 20:37.467
JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M GONNA HAVE HIM IN BED

20:37.467 --> 20:40.200
EVERY NIGHT
WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.100
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF I DID HAVE A SON

20:44.100 --> 20:46.700
AND THE OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTED ITSELF

20:46.700 --> 20:49.734
TO WAKE HIM UP
TO WATCH A BASEBALL GAME

20:49.734 --> 20:51.967
OR TO LISTEN
TO THE PRESIDENT

20:51.967 --> 20:54.000
ON THE RADIO,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.500
OR FOR ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON AT ALL...

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
WELL...

21:01.400 --> 21:02.934
GOOD NIGHT, ALAN.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.834
GOOD NIGHT, GEORGE.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.000
NIGHT, COR.
HAVE GOOD DREAMS.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.500
YOU, TOO.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.000
HEY, MOM?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.200
HEY, COR?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.000
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.133
SURE.

21:22.133 --> 21:25.200
I'M ON THE CLOCK
FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.800
UM...WELL,
EARLIER TONIGHT,

21:27.800 --> 21:30.033
DAD TOLD ME
MR. FEENY WAS RIGHT.

21:30.033 --> 21:31.000
AND THEN LATER ON,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
MR. FEENY TOLD ME
DAD WAS RIGHT.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.100
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
I THINK HE WAS SAYING.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.934
SOMETIMES I CAN'T
HOLD MY BREATH LONG ENOUGH

21:36.934 --> 21:39.400
TO GET DOWN TO WHERE
MR. FEENY LIKES TO SWIM.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.900
WELL, COR,
SOMETIMES 2 ADULTS

21:43.900 --> 21:45.767
CAN THINK 2 DIFFERENT
WAYS ABOUT SOMETHING,

21:45.767 --> 21:47.567
AND BOTH CAN BE RIGHT.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.200
THEN, HOW COME I ONLY THINK
ONE WAY ABOUT THINGS,

21:50.200 --> 21:51.500
AND I'M ALWAYS WRONG?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.700
GOOD NIGHT, CORY.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TOMORROW?

21:54.900 --> 21:56.867
THE PHILLIES
ARE STILL IN LOS ANGELES.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.300
WHAT IF THERE'S
A NO-HITTER GOING?

21:58.300 --> 22:00.500
WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT
GOES ON THE RADIO?

22:00.500 --> 22:03.500
WHATEVER GOES ON
CAN WAIT TILL TOMORROW.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.834
HOW COME?

22:04.834 --> 22:08.367
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
IS ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE

22:08.367 --> 22:10.967
IN THE MORNING
TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

22:10.967 --> 22:12.300
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.100
GOOD NIGHT, SON.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.767
AM I STILL GROUNDED?

22:17.767 --> 22:19.233
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

22:19.233 --> 22:22.300
HEY, TALK I CAN GET
ANYWHERE.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.467
HMM?

22:25.667 --> 22:28.033
HE WON'T BE BACK TONIGHT.
