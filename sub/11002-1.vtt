<i>You know what my first memory is?</i>

00:16.640 --> 00:18.722
<i>Feeling special.</i>

00:18.880 --> 00:21.724
<i>The first time I pooped,
there was applause.</i>

00:21.880 --> 00:25.851
<i>When we scribbled something in crayon,
it was a Picasso.</i>

00:26.040 --> 00:28.042
<i>Gold stickers for everyone.</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:33.442
<i>C+ in gym? Perfect attendance?
"Hey, here's 100 bucks. "</i>

00:33.600 --> 00:35.762
<i>When we hit a new level on</i> Wave Race,

00:35.920 --> 00:38.321
<i>it was like we won the Olympics.</i>

00:38.480 --> 00:41.768
<i>For kids of my generation,
strike three meant one thing:</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:45.604
<i>take your base.</i>

00:45.760 --> 00:48.366
<i>Look out, world.
Here we come.</i>

00:52.520 --> 00:54.761
Closer, closer, closer.
There we go.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.763
- Look at that.
- Aw, you are so cute together.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.127
Adorable.
So, Jillian,

01:02.280 --> 01:05.363
Will tells us that you are going to
start working at Johnson & Johnson.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.888
- That's fantastic!
- Thank you. Yeah, I'm excited to start.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.122
Sales Analyst.
It sounds so impressive.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.807
Junior Sales Analyst. But the "Junior"
is gonna be gone by Christmas.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.327
Ah. And Will's finally being paid
at <i>LA Weekly.</i>

01:18.480 --> 01:19.891
- Way to go, you two.
- I know.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.042
I told you guys,
we're a power couple.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.361
Will, there's a little something
to get you started.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.804
Wow!

01:31.960 --> 01:33.689
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Mom.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.731
Will, did I ever tell you
what my first job was?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.167
Was it, by any chance, stacking crates
of tomatoes in a warehouse, Dad?

01:40.320 --> 01:41.560
Correct.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.485
Must have been 100 degrees
in that warehouse.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.642
- You know what got me through?
- I'm gonna go with air conditioning.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.848
Air conditioning.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.281
There was one office
that was air conditioned.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.010
High above the floor.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.640
It was for the warehouse supervisor.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.081
And I told myself right then and there,

01:58.240 --> 02:01.767
"I don't know how I'm gonna do it,
but I'm going to get to that office."

02:01.920 --> 02:04.241
Didn't that guy have
a heart attack, Dad?

02:05.040 --> 02:08.646
It was an aneurysm.
The point is, I worked my way up

02:08.800 --> 02:12.202
until I was in charge of the entire
North American supply chain.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.006
I am proof there's nothing
you can't achieve.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.640
Exactly, and that's why
I'm saying this <i>LA Weekly</i> thing

02:17.800 --> 02:19.404
is really just a springboard for me.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.164
'Cause, I mean, I'm gonna dominate
their Web edition.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.085
I've got videos, live blogging,
interactive content.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.642
- I'm building my brand.
- Brand?

02:36.320 --> 02:38.084
- You spent the money on a TV?
- Yeah.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.288
That's one of the largest televisions
available on the market today.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.761
Seventy inches. What?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.370
You want to know why
we're not living together?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.885
- Exhibit A.
- Boo!

02:46.960 --> 02:49.531
Hey, J. La.
Was that your sister at graduation?

02:49.680 --> 02:51.205
- No.
- Are you sure?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.520
Mm-mm.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.331
I saw her, like, hugging your parents
and giving your dad a little...

02:55.480 --> 02:57.084
I mean, can I get her phone number?

02:57.280 --> 03:00.250
- Is this the iStalkU?
- It's the iSearchU.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.165
- If you could just mind your business.
- What is iStalkU?

03:03.320 --> 03:04.924
The iSearchU?

03:05.120 --> 03:07.248
It's just an app that I'm developing.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.006
Say there's a person that you want to
find, but they don't want to be found.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.731
Like, there's this girl,
and you've called her a million times,

03:12.920 --> 03:14.524
and she just won't return
your messages.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.651
My app allows you to send them
a text message and, whoo!

03:18.760 --> 03:20.603
Receive back their exact location.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.044
So there's nowhere to hide,
Jillian's sister. Nowhere.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.043
No, you cannot have her number.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.089
I'll find your sister.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.129
You're gonna end up in iJail
getting iRaped.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.170
And I'm gonna handle the iStock IPO!

03:36.200 --> 03:37.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:38.000 --> 03:40.321
- You don't even have a job.
- I got a business degree.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.801
Unlike Broke Nuts over here,
I have marketable skills.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.042
Unlike you, Broke Nuts has a job.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.846
I have nine interviews this week.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.088
Today, it's Morgan Stanley...

03:54.320 --> 03:55.810
And Great Pacific.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.047
I love you all.
Get your lives together.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.690
- Good luck, dude.
- Good luck.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.010
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like to be my guest?

04:05.160 --> 04:08.084
Hi, have we met?
I'm Jillian.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.050
- God. Boo!
- Stop booing me, Charlie.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.202
Just one time.
Just smoke with me.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.169
Make an exception.
We're celebrating.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.644
- Charlie got a job today.
- McDonald's or Taco Bell?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.001
Middle school chemistry teacher.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.606
What?

04:27.680 --> 04:30.206
I weep for our future.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.283
<i>Fuck me in the ass! Fuck me!</i>

04:53.920 --> 04:55.285
Hey, Brian.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.926
Hey, Will.
Looking good, buddy.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.641
We don't have a job for you.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.405
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we don't have a job for you.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.641
We've downsized.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.970
Yeah, but I'm perfect for this job.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.891
I'm sorry, Will.
Thank you very much.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.281
Look, Brian, I got three Webisodes
all ready to upload...

05:17.440 --> 05:19.761
"Where to Find the Best Beef Machaca,"
"How to Bike the LA River,"

05:19.960 --> 05:22.201
and "Why Ultimate Frisbee
is More Complex Than Chess."

05:22.360 --> 05:25.125
You're not alone.
I had to let eight people go last week.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.527
Why didn't you tell me?

05:29.840 --> 05:31.808
Honestly, with everything going on
around here, I just...

05:31.880 --> 05:34.804
I forgot. Good.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.287
You forgot? I spent two summers
interning here for free

05:41.480 --> 05:44.882
so that I could have a job waiting
for me after graduation, and you forgot.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.690
Look, I've already told everybody
about this job.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.208
I told my friends and my family and my
parents about this job, and you forgot!

05:50.360 --> 05:52.760
Well, guess what, Brian?
You can't do this kind of shit, man!

05:52.840 --> 05:54.808
I deserve to be treated
a little better than this.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.890
And I think you owe me
a little more than "I forgot."

06:00.280 --> 06:02.487
Will...

06:02.560 --> 06:04.289
Uh...

06:08.920 --> 06:10.331
I don't owe you shit.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.802
"Systems administrator"?
No.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.564
"Nuclear pipe technician"?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.848
No, you haven't laid
that much pipe, so...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.207
I've laid a lot of pipe, Charles.
Ask your mother.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.845
Sick burn.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.003
- "Unemployment benefits administrator."
- Yeah, dude, that one.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.009
That'd be ironic.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.407
It's not ironic if it's all the time.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.688
You know what's all the time?
Ball taps and kills.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.844
Dude, don't play dirty, man.
Don't play dirty.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.008
Oh, shit.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.164
Dude, I honestly have no idea
what any of this shit means.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.005
Well, you better figure it out soon.
The rent is due Friday.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.881
I know. I just need something to keep
the lights on until I find my dream job.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.884
I don't think you can
monetize masturbation.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.650
It was too good.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.246
Oh, here's something
in the hospitality industry.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.607
You don't have any sort
of medical degree.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.367
Okay, there's a gun in the drawer,
but you probably won't need it.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.409
All right.
Good night, kid.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.808
There are Negroes on this boat!

07:26.960 --> 07:28.720
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.525
You the new guy?

07:33.640 --> 07:36.041
- Uh, yeah, I am new.
- Skeezy D.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.724
Will.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.640
Three rooms.
Keep the change.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.001
Girl, you better treat this man right.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.730
He was in Vietnam.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.325
Korea.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.687
Get in there and bust a nut,
Hawkeye Pierce!

07:53.760 --> 07:58.084
Hell, Cheryl's one of my best girls.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.289
- Hard worker?
- That pussy comes correct.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.164
- Where'd you meet her?
- Met her at my last gig.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.847
- Which... where was that?
- Borders.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.287
Hmm?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.169
Borders...
Borders bookstore?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.800
Listen, man,
shit went sideways, okay?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.691
Everybody was out of work.
I had to get out of there real quick.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.127
So, why "Skeezy D"?

08:24.440 --> 08:28.650
Men who hire prostitutes
aren't paying them for sex, Will.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.361
They're paying for danger.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.330
They're paying to feel alive.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.961
Hey, motherfucker,
you better pay my bitch what you owe.

08:43.679 --> 08:47.890
They're paying
for a certain <i>joie de vivre.</i>

08:47.960 --> 08:49.246
<i>Joie de vivre?</i>

08:50.120 --> 08:51.406
That's French.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.647
I'm not resisting arrest.
Okay, I'm not resisting arrest.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.326
Okay, I'm not resisting arrest.
I'm not.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.164
I'm not. I'm not.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.129
Hey, bitch, we had a deal!

09:21.280 --> 09:23.408
You were renting out rooms to hookers?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.130
- Skeezy said they're here every...
- No, no.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.123
That's not the kind of establishment
I'm running here.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.442
Read the sign there, kid.
It says "No prostitution."

09:29.600 --> 09:32.126
That clearly includes hookers.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.521
You're fired.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.366
I'm sorry, Officer. I just got to be
a little more careful about who I hire.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.522
- You do that.
- Yeah. Will do. Will do.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.087
Thanks for everything you do, Officer.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.365
Sorry, kid.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.688
Shit rolls downhill.
You know what I'm saying?

09:48.840 --> 09:52.367
You get it. You get it.
You'll be all right.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.482
Son of a bitch!

09:59.440 --> 10:01.044
- Hey, Dad?
- Hmm?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.963
I gotta ask you for money.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.082
Will, you're a grown-up now.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.322
I'm not gonna give you
any more money.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.608
Dad, what am I supposed to do?
You want me to go

10:11.680 --> 10:13.682
sell my body on the street?

10:13.800 --> 10:16.531
Enough of the life lessons here, man.
I am broke.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.245
I literally have no money
for anything.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.526
I lost my job.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.366
Are you serious?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.244
Afraid so.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.442
Well, what happened?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.570
Apparently, I was so successful

10:34.640 --> 10:36.802
at streamlining
the beverage supply chain

10:36.960 --> 10:40.567
that I made my own job obsolete.
Hmm.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.284
So, what are you gonna do?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.488
I'm going to get a job!

10:46.640 --> 10:49.689
I'm gonna follow my ABC's,
stay positive,

10:49.840 --> 10:52.207
and in the interim, look!

10:52.360 --> 10:55.887
I can tackle all the chores
I never had time for.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.362
You guys gotta get your lives together.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.086
Top 1%, here I come, baby!

11:15.600 --> 11:17.762
Hey, this guy got a job.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.367
It's called Top Deck Securities.
I start clerking next month.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.410
If I kick ass,
I'll be making trades by December.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.848
From this point on, it's gonna be
coffee and cocaine for me, baby.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.287
- Whoo!
- Do you take change for dollars?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.169
No, no. Keep it.
You worked hard.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.322
You've got an incredible
amount of torque.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.642
You deserve so much more money
than this,

11:39.840 --> 11:42.127
but I'm on a teacher's salary.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.441
Hey.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.965
Hey!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.327
If you want to see the show,
you gotta pay for it.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.410
No, I'm just here for the free buffet.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.002
The buffet is free 'cause you're
supposed to be spending money on me.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.006
I guess I found a loophole.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.687
- Your friend's got an attitude.
- He's out of work.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.320
So buy him a lap dance
to cheer him up.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.845
Ooh.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.201
- Yeah.
- I'd like to get to know you sometime.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.681
- Don't get her pregnant.
- Oh, hey, look.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.530
- I have a girlfriend.
- Yo, Will!

12:21.840 --> 12:24.764
- So, you're looking for a job?
- Yeah.

12:24.920 --> 12:29.084
What would you do if you won the lottery
and never had to work again?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.720
- I don't know.
- What's your passion?

12:33.040 --> 12:35.566
What do you love to do?

12:35.720 --> 12:38.166
I like to make funny YouTube videos.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.044
Oh, if you like making YouTube videos,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.407
why aren't you looking
for corporate video work?

12:42.560 --> 12:45.643
Corporate?
Yeah, I don't do corporate.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.882
Listen, babe.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.807
When you're first starting out,
you gotta stay flexible.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.888
- Do you know what we do here, Hamilton?
- Trade stocks.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.202
Wrong. We make money.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.490
This is Hamilton.
He is clerking for us.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.808
I had to shit-can
that other douchebag

13:11.960 --> 13:14.725
because, well, I couldn't stand
looking at his face anymore.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.680
- Put all your orders in through him.
- Wait, I get to put in orders?

13:18.840 --> 13:22.083
- More than you can imagine.
- Hell, yeah.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.320
Go across the street,
get me three triple espressos.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.442
Put three sugars in each one.
None of that Splenda shit.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.409
- I want the real thing.
- Go to Fatburger.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.449
Get me 12 double XLs
with extra cheese,

13:30.600 --> 13:32.921
12 chili-cheese fat fries,
nine milk shakes.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.851
Hey, go to 7-Eleven. Pick me up
25 Black Cherry lottery tickets.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.361
Fifteen grand top prize.
You scratch them off.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.170
Start from the bottom.
Odd numbers first.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.484
- Go! Go, go, go...
- Still here? Still here?

13:45.480 --> 13:47.323
And I better fucking win!

13:50.520 --> 13:51.965
What are you doing?

13:52.120 --> 13:55.567
- I need a sexy video of you.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.883
I made an appointment
to donate sperm. What?

13:59.040 --> 14:02.362
Your best idea for making rent
is masturbating into a cup?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.568
I'm an accomplished masturbator.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.802
Will, I don't know
what's going on with you.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.400
At school, you always had
a million different things going on.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.761
Your energy was contagious.
It's what I loved about you.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.403
And right now, it feels like you're just
flailing around, making it up as you go.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.927
I saw a job counselor last week.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.090
Really? A job counselor?

14:23.240 --> 14:27.245
And she was all over me about
forming a strategy, and just really...

14:27.400 --> 14:29.243
She rode me to stay flexible,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.290
and so we decided to focus
on corporate video work.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.762
I sent out my résumé.
I should start interviewing next week.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.922
Come here.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.607
Do you remember Ultimate Frisbee?
Not the districts, the regionals.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.604
I made that 50-yard huck to Sullivan.
It was an awesome pass.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.810
- I don't know what we're talking about.
- What I'm saying is, don't worry.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.201
I'm at my best when my back
is against the wall.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.488
This isn't college, Will.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.283
Please, I need you to step up.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.966
Thirty years, one company.
Wow!

15:03.120 --> 15:06.522
An employer sees this,
and they see a dinosaur.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.164
Well, I can't say that
I agree with you there, Fernando.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.402
- Fernando. Fernando.
- It's Fernando?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.921
You should do whatever you can
to look younger.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.923
For starters, lose the beard.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.890
An image consult is included
with the Platinum Package.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.168
We'll give you a workstation,
some place to go every morning.

15:24.360 --> 15:29.810
And we will produce a video résumé
that will set you above the rabble.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.566
But all of that is just preparation
for the main event.

15:34.880 --> 15:38.282
Wilheimer has an 85%
placement rate, Mr. Davis.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.171
- Wow!
- How do you think we make that number?

15:41.320 --> 15:43.766
- Well, I...
- That's a rhetorical question.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.931
While everyone else is out there
wasting their time,

15:48.080 --> 15:50.321
meeting mid-level H R hacks,

15:50.480 --> 15:53.927
Wilheimer will be putting you
in front of the person

15:54.080 --> 15:58.085
who can pull the trigger
and actually hire you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.891
- The decision maker?
- The decision maker.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.769
- That's right. Well...
- I like it.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.161
Bottom line, how much
are we talking here?

16:10.360 --> 16:15.651
Oh, the Platinum Package
is a one-time fee of $30,000.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.124
No, seriously,
how much are we talking?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.085
Hey, there!

16:54.280 --> 16:56.931
- Tough day?
- What?

16:57.560 --> 16:58.721
No.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.404
No, no, no.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.121
A tough day is just
an unrealized great day.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.611
Well, then, I'm gonna hook you up
with some Rockin' Moroccan.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.648
- It's like legal hash.
- Oh.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.965
I'm Cammy.
What's your name?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.281
- Roger.
- Roger that.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.280
Oh, to go, please.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.170
Hello?

17:23.040 --> 17:26.169
Oh, hey, honey.
How are you?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.924
I'm at the office.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.203
Oh, that music?
Yeah, well, I...

17:31.400 --> 17:33.482
That's, uh...

17:33.560 --> 17:35.927
You know Jerry.
He's just trying to jazz up his...

17:36.080 --> 17:38.003
I should get back
to that meeting, honey.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.009
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.521
I love you too. Bye.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.205
Uh...

17:46.280 --> 17:48.760
That was my wife.

17:49.960 --> 17:54.249
Well, look, we have free Wi-Fi
and three-prong outlets out the wazoo.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.646
So...

17:58.440 --> 18:00.807
And, uh... don't worry, Rog.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.566
No one here has a job.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.091
Thank you.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.409
You children may begin.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.690
Now, the goal of this experiment
is to create an even coating,

18:36.880 --> 18:40.566
no excess charring,
and no cold spots.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.762
I mean it, Dayjon.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.969
And remember, don't stare in the flame
for too long, because it will...

18:47.400 --> 18:49.880
steal your soul.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.042
Let me see that. Yeah.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.686
Mm.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.331
That is close to perfection.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.882
- Mr. Baxter?
- Stop calling me that!

19:08.080 --> 19:09.605
It's Charlie, okay?

19:09.760 --> 19:12.491
Okay, Charlie.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.928
Why do all of our experiments
involve making food?

19:16.080 --> 19:19.846
I get the munchies after free period.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.847
- Any more questions, Sergeant Buzzkill?
- No.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.684
- Mr. Baxter?
- It's Charlie!

19:26.840 --> 19:28.763
My sixth grade basketball coach
just quit.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.524
You interested in the position?

19:30.680 --> 19:34.002
I'm sorry, do I look like someone
with free time on his hands?

19:34.160 --> 19:35.605
It's an extra $100 a week.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.961
They will prosper under my tutelage.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.970
Tanya Sellers, Human Resources.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.880
Sorry it took me so long
to get back to you.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.243
We received close to 1,000 résumés
for the videographer position.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.402
- I was just glad that you called.
- Oh.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.369
Katherine Dunn oversees
our video services,

19:56.520 --> 19:58.522
but she's in China
on a leadership conference,

19:58.680 --> 20:01.968
so you get a nonstop flight
to the decision maker himself,

20:02.120 --> 20:03.531
Lawrence Wilheimer.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.008
He's a legend in executive placement.
He revolutionized the game.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.686
- Make sure you check out his package.
- His retirement package?

20:09.840 --> 20:13.003
His package-package.
He's hung like a fucking minotaur.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.320
Fat.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.326
- William Davis.
- Yes, sir.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.201
"Vast experience in all aspects
of video production."

20:26.360 --> 20:28.169
Could you elaborate on that?

20:28.320 --> 20:29.924
Well, sir, for the past seven years,

20:30.120 --> 20:32.726
I've been producing
original video content for YouTube.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.968
- YouTube?
- Yes, sir.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.567
I think YouTube is the perfect training
ground for producing video résumés

20:39.640 --> 20:41.369
that really stand out from the crowd.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.683
And clients of Southern California's
premiere executive placement firm

20:44.760 --> 20:46.410
deserve those kind of résumés.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.600
Ones that grab the employer's attention,
don't let go.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.324
Even if they say "uncle."

20:50.400 --> 20:53.404
So, hire William Davis,
and your clients will...

20:56.720 --> 20:59.963
Hire William Davis,
and your clients will rise above

21:00.040 --> 21:01.201
the rest of the...

21:01.320 --> 21:03.402
I'm so sorry about that.
Uh, hire William Davis,

21:03.560 --> 21:06.245
and your clients will rise above and...

21:06.400 --> 21:08.880
That's what you want, right?

21:09.080 --> 21:12.323
My girlfriend and I are having a fight.
Do you mind if I...

21:13.720 --> 21:16.485
What could be more important?

21:16.640 --> 21:19.166
Thank you, sir.
That's what I'm saying.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.403
And send.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.210
So, where were we?

21:24.280 --> 21:27.489
I was showing you the door,
Mr. Davis.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.085
That's it over there.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.650
Okay.
Uh... thank you.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.564
Uh, look, sir...
I mean, I don't think...

21:40.720 --> 21:43.007
I don't know if this is the exact
subject matter that you're looking for,

21:43.160 --> 21:45.288
but I think that this really
showcases my abilities

21:45.440 --> 21:47.240
to recognize what's unique
about an individual

21:47.280 --> 21:50.523
and how to foreground that
for the marketplace.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.168
<i>What is your business philosophy?</i>

21:56.560 --> 21:59.166
<i>It is all about customer satisfaction.</i>

21:59.320 --> 22:03.882
<i>We are basically
the Burlington Coat Factory of bitches.</i>

22:03.960 --> 22:06.804
<i>I got bitches on layaway,
you know what I'm saying?</i>

22:06.880 --> 22:09.406
<i>For $599,
you can mark down a bitch.</i>

22:09.480 --> 22:12.848
All right, hey, just, you know,
be careful with it, man.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.648
I really
don't like these guys.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.200
Watch your fingerprints.
Are you serious?

22:18.360 --> 22:20.567
That's a big-boy TV.
Come on, man.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.121
- Use an HDMI cord. Don't use...
- Thanks, bro.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.680
Take care of my TV, bro.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.041
- Yeah, this is Will.
<i>- Will, Tanya, from Wilheimer.</i>

22:31.240 --> 22:34.403
- Are you calling about my interview?
<i>- Sure am.</i>

22:34.560 --> 22:38.087
- Mr. Wilheimer pressing charges?
<i>- You're in, player!</i>

22:38.160 --> 22:39.400
- What?
<i>- You're in.</i>

22:39.560 --> 22:43.565
<i>Starting salary is $26, 000, partial
health benefits kick in after 90 days.</i>

22:44.720 --> 22:46.245
Wait, are you saying
that I have a job?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.051
<i>- That's what I'm saying.</i>
- Oh, yo! Wait, wait, wait!

22:52.040 --> 22:55.123
Hello, you got good news.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.648
<i>Tell Will he gets the job
as soon as he passes a drug test.</i>

22:58.800 --> 23:01.451
Drug test?
Is it multiple choice?

23:02.400 --> 23:04.641
- Will.
- Hey, what's up, Dad?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.721
What's going on?

23:08.880 --> 23:09.881
I got a job.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.042
Hey!

23:12.240 --> 23:14.129
- That's great!
- I know.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.408
It's at this place called Wilheimer.
They do job placement.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.325
Oh, yeah.
I've heard good things.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.006
I just need one thing...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.923
and I'm good to go.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.330
- You're smoking pot?
- I'm an occasional user!

23:27.480 --> 23:29.164
I never smoke and drive!

23:29.320 --> 23:33.041
And you want me to urinate into this
bottle so that you can pass a drug test?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.486
Goddamn it!

23:34.600 --> 23:35.931
Dad, look,
there's no one else I can ask.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.730
I'm hanging by
a thread with Jillian, plus

23:37.800 --> 23:39.370
they might be
able to screen for gender.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.928
Ethan is tainted, Luke is unclean,
and Charlie's radioactive.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.286
What am I supposed to do?

23:44.480 --> 23:45.720
Get new friends!

23:45.880 --> 23:47.211
I have a job.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.925
I've a real job for a real company.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.923
The kind of job that you've
been bugging me to get for years.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.120
And if I don't produce
an immaculate cup of urine...

23:53.160 --> 23:55.288
- Shh!
- It's back to the unemployment line.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.647
- Is that what you want?
- No, it's not what I want.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.486
You know that. I just don't
feel comfortable doing this.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.491
Okay.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.005
Air conditioning, so...

24:05.160 --> 24:07.367
- No.
- It was 100 degrees in that warehouse,

24:07.520 --> 24:09.480
and you did whatever it took
to get off the floor.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.921
And that's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.889
I'm doing what you told me.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.009
What happened to you?

24:43.160 --> 24:45.242
Hey, I just pulled a hammy.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.129
- Pounding box?
- What?

24:47.280 --> 24:49.442
Pounding box?
Putting it in that pussy.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.090
Giving it to her. Yeah.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.561
No, I was hitting the gym.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.490
- Hitting those weights.
- All right.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.808
- Ready to make it rain?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.690
What are you doing?

25:05.840 --> 25:09.049
I'm required to be in here,
in case you try some monkey business.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.170
Okay. Are you gonna
come in the stall with me too?

25:12.360 --> 25:15.409
No stall, baby doll.
You gotta rock out with that cock out.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.006
I'll just be right behind here,
listening close.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.409
Okay, I kind of have a shy bladder.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.689
Oh, that's too bad,
because you have 30 seconds.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.285
Starting now!

25:29.720 --> 25:33.122
If you're having trouble,
just think of waterfalls!

25:34.640 --> 25:39.123
Or, like, fire hoses just
blasting water out.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.568
22, 21...

25:43.720 --> 25:46.291
Think of, like, things gushing!

25:46.480 --> 25:48.289
Or, like, squirting.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.687
18, 17...

25:50.840 --> 25:55.004
You know, I'm a squirter, but only if
I'm, like, comfortable with a person.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.127
Ten, nine, eight,

26:01.280 --> 26:05.444
seven, six, five...

26:05.600 --> 26:07.160
All right, that's enough!
I'm coming in!

26:07.200 --> 26:08.440
Oh.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.601
Got it!

26:11.120 --> 26:14.044
Hi-ho, Silver.
Brrr!

26:14.640 --> 26:17.120
Oh! Wow!

26:17.200 --> 26:19.089
Whew!

26:23.400 --> 26:27.803
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. Whew!

26:27.880 --> 26:30.281
Man, I should get a job more often.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.051
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck, yeah! That was awesome.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.850
I have something else for you.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.240
- Back door?
- Ha!

26:37.320 --> 26:38.970
- Yeah, I'll go get my strap-on.
- Okay.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.326
You love it!

26:43.360 --> 26:45.044
What is this?

26:49.680 --> 26:52.126
- Oh.
- Can I see it?

26:52.280 --> 26:54.282
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.280
Oh, baby.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.124
My unique skill set allows me
to seamlessly integrate

27:03.280 --> 27:05.601
into a range of management structures,

27:05.760 --> 27:09.321
which makes me highly employable
in today's marketplace.

27:09.440 --> 27:14.241
<i>Uh, mainly I've found that dealing
with people is my best skill.</i>

27:14.360 --> 27:17.648
<i>Um, I have a lot of charisma.</i>

27:20.320 --> 27:24.166
An ordinary man takes everything
as a blessing or a curse.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.449
A warrior takes it as a challenge.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.602
Um... who are you?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.244
Exciting stuff.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.686
Yeah, it's riveting.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.171
Just follow the boilerplate,
and you'll be fine.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.642
Clients choose from three backgrounds.
Skyline.

27:51.800 --> 27:56.169
There's also Corner Office
and Bookshelf.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.681
Corner Office and Bookshelf.
Got it.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.368
I made a video in here once.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.051
And I'm not the only one.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.521
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.120
Oh, Mr. Wilheimer, I wanted
to thank you for this opportunity.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.209
Oh, well, always on the lookout
for fresh talent, Will.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.691
Just one thing.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.531
Could you put me in touch
with that fellow from your video?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.370
The... mm.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.762
Yes, sir.
In six months to a year.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.160
Depending on good behavior.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.404
What the fuck?
What the fuck!

28:52.120 --> 28:54.646
How is it possible to be this bad?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.404
Ball.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.721
Okay.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.565
Kwan, let's review the basics.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.842
- Give and go!
- Ow!

29:06.920 --> 29:08.410
Jesus Christ.

29:12.520 --> 29:16.047
Big Stuff, anyone ever show you
how to set a pick?

29:16.200 --> 29:17.247
No.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.044
Get ready to bring some pain.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.290
Hamilton!

29:33.440 --> 29:34.771
Come here!

29:36.200 --> 29:38.885
This is deer scent.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.247
I use it out in the wild when I hunt.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.929
I use it in here,

29:44.080 --> 29:47.971
when I think a clerk
is ready for his very own desk.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.445
Drink it.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.280
Hold it!

29:58.560 --> 30:00.722
I'm gonna go ahead and let him
make up his own mind.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.362
Do you want your own desk?

30:04.960 --> 30:07.486
Or do you want to be a fucking clerk
the rest of your life?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.484
Your call.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.010
Two-to-one he drinks the deer cum.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.403
Deer cum?

30:29.480 --> 30:31.847
Drink it.
Drink the deer cum.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.809
Deer cum.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.804
Deer cum!
Deer cum! Deer cum!

30:54.320 --> 30:57.688
Uh-oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think it's coming back up.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.968
500 bucks says he gonna hurl.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.521
Breathe.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.602
You like that nutty taste in your
mouth?

31:04.680 --> 31:06.842
Oh, that's Bambi batter.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.450
Give it to me.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.682
Roll it around.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.521
Oh!

31:27.560 --> 31:31.121
Awesome!

31:44.080 --> 31:45.730
Did you see the arc on that?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.281
You're my bitch.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.169
Hey, guys, you're gonna want
to pause the game for this.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.890
- Ethan, what are you doing, man?
- Come on, man!

31:53.040 --> 31:55.611
It's a game of <i>Halo!</i>
Relax, I've got something to show you.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.921
- Wait!
- Come on, move.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.923
- ♪ <i>Bong, bong, bong, bong</i>
- This better be good.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.571
♪ <i>Bong, bong, bong, bong</i>

32:02.640 --> 32:04.847
- Whoa!
- ♪ <i>Bong, bong, bong, bong</i>

32:04.920 --> 32:06.081
Oh, my God!

32:06.240 --> 32:08.163
Dude, I found some extra tubing
in my chem class.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.725
I put my little boys and girls to work.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.769
- Nice!
- What's the special occasion?

32:11.920 --> 32:13.560
Yeah, we're celebrating me
getting a desk.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.887
- Oh, that's right.
- And me buying an island.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
- You're not buying an island.
- No?

32:18.160 --> 32:20.208
Because I met someone who knows
Warren Buffett's bridge partner.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.442
I'm gonna offer him some stock
from my company

32:22.600 --> 32:24.887
in exchange for Warren Buffett's
cell phone number.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.520
I'm gonna iSearchU Warren Buffett,
pitch him my app,

32:27.680 --> 32:30.445
gain access to billions of dollars
in venture capital,

32:30.600 --> 32:33.604
buy my island,
and populate it with porn stars.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.081
I'm sorry I doubted you.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.641
- No, you didn't know the plan.
- I didn't know the plan.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.322
Rick. What's up, man?

32:45.640 --> 32:50.601
Oh, Will, this is Katherine Dunn,
Vice President of our Client Services.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.969
It's good to have you back.
Get ready to have your mind blown.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.646
Because I'm taking video résumés
to the next level.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.723
Okay? Ready for this?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.883
<i>People think accountants are a bunch
of number-crunching nerds,</i>

33:07.040 --> 33:08.485
<i>but I'm a jazz buff.</i>

33:08.640 --> 33:12.406
<i>I like to think of the tax code
as my instrument.</i>

33:40.000 --> 33:45.040
<i>I'm Tom Wilson,
at tomwilsonaccountant. com.</i>

33:48.480 --> 33:51.006
That was quite impactful.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.321
So, what do we think?

33:52.480 --> 33:53.880
I think it makes him seem youthful.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.160
Yeah, until now,
I always thought of Tom as a total dud.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.883
This is an executive placement firm,
Mr. Davis,

34:03.040 --> 34:05.281
not MTV.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.847
Yeah, nobody's going to hire this guy
because of his personality.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.241
Yeah, he needs to look professional.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.284
Everyone's always loved
the old résumés, so...

34:15.080 --> 34:16.969
You seem to have mistaken this video

34:17.120 --> 34:21.205
as an opportunity
to express yourself, Mr. Davis.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.126
From now on, you will follow
the guidebook to the letter.

34:25.280 --> 34:29.126
Yeah, I found the guidebook
to be kind of limiting.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.284
I wrote the guidebook, Mr. Davis.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.248
And while I have you here,

34:36.400 --> 34:40.041
there are some issues of comportment
that apparently need clarification.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.443
You will maintain
a professional appearance.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.768
That means a suit and a tie.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.650
It does not mean sneakers.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.371
It does not mean khakis.

34:53.520 --> 34:57.081
It does not mean that unwashed rag
you call a T-shirt.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.086
Got it.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.725
"Got it"?

35:02.600 --> 35:03.601
Understood?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.607
And while I was away,

35:09.760 --> 35:14.163
I was a recipient of several
of your reply-all e-mails.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.086
They were inappropriate, offensive,

35:18.240 --> 35:22.211
and most of all, not funny.

35:22.360 --> 35:26.365
Nobody wants a birthday spanking
from you, Mr. Davis.

35:30.440 --> 35:35.082
And finally, I took a look
at your Facebook page

35:35.240 --> 35:38.449
and was confronted
with this sordid image.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.521
I was there for the buffet.

35:44.640 --> 35:49.441
You are an employee
of this company, Mr. Davis.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.764
Your behavior must conform
to the exacting standards

35:53.960 --> 35:57.248
of the Wilheimer
Executive Placement Firm.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.801
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.440
- Understood?
- Understood.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.763
Hi, Pearl. Roger Davis.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.763
Is Mr. Gentry in?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.729
He's not? Okay.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.123
Do you know if he's had a chance
to look at my résumé yet?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.888
Regional Distribution Manager,
Scanner and Disk Duplicator Division?

36:22.520 --> 36:26.969
No. Okay.
Um...

36:27.080 --> 36:32.291
Do you know if he received the package
of Rockin' Moroccan coffee that...

36:32.440 --> 36:35.603
Oh, hello?
Okay, why don't you hang up first?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.369
- Hey!
- Hey.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.885
Hi, buddy!

36:43.880 --> 36:46.406
Come on into my office here.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.170
Cammy, come on over.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.971
This is Will.
Will, this is my friend, Cammy.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.282
Hey, Will.
How's the job working out?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.881
- Uh, it's good.
- Good.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.883
Dad, what did you do to your beard?

36:58.040 --> 37:01.522
Well, I lost two jobs in a week
to people in their 30s.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.730
So Cammy volunteered
to make me look ten years younger.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.282
Gothic Raven.
What do you think? Hmm?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.328
Yeah.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.164
Cammy, are you helping him out
with his Twitter feed, too?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.129
Oh, Rog doesn't need any help.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.170
Yeah? I think Rog needs
a little bit of help.

37:18.240 --> 37:22.404
"My friend Jim lost his mother
yesterday. LOL, Jim."

37:22.480 --> 37:24.642
What? "Lots of love."

37:24.760 --> 37:27.081
It's okay.
You want another one, Rog?

37:27.160 --> 37:29.606
Keep them coming.
Oh, one for Will, too, please.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.842
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm okay, whoever you are.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.922
So, what's up?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.844
Well, my supervisor's back from leave,
and she is a total ballbuster.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.684
I mean, she was on my ass
about my e-mails,

37:38.760 --> 37:40.762
and my Facebook page,
and how I dress in front of everybody.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.842
It was humiliating.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.082
Wait, this isn't how you dress
at work, is it?

37:45.200 --> 37:48.488
Dad, I'm the video guy.
Who cares what I look like?

37:48.560 --> 37:51.769
Look, just stop, okay?
Stop for a second.

37:51.920 --> 37:56.562
Your clients pay $30,000
for your services.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.210
They care what you look like.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.523
You need to conform to their standards,
not the other way around.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.321
And the fact that you can't grasp that
is mind-boggling!

38:06.760 --> 38:07.886
What is up with you?

38:08.040 --> 38:11.362
What is up with me is,
I've sent out hundreds of résumés,

38:11.520 --> 38:13.807
and I've gotten only three interviews.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.123
What is up with me is,
I don't want to hear you bitch and moan

38:17.280 --> 38:20.204
that your employer makes you act
in a professional manner.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.811
That is what's up with me.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.122
Okay, Dad, well, look,
I'm sorry for telling you how I feel.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.526
I didn't know just because
I have a job

38:25.600 --> 38:27.090
and you don't that
you wouldn't listen to me.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.410
Oh, I'm listening, all right,
but all I hear is a spoiled little brat!

38:32.560 --> 38:33.686
Okay.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.205
You look like Billy Mays.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.411
- I look like Willie Mays?
- You look like Billy Mays!

38:43.560 --> 38:45.528
Who's Billy Mays?

38:46.160 --> 38:48.447
If you're gonna tell someone off,
make it clear!

39:01.600 --> 39:03.443
What do you think?

39:03.600 --> 39:06.843
Hot. Very, very hot.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.527
They're Prada.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.489
They were $779.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.248
I know. I just...

39:19.080 --> 39:21.321
I just want them
to take me seriously at work.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.086
Everybody takes you seriously.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.366
- They do?
- Yes, they do.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.443
Sophomore year.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.649
We're running Ultimate Frisbee drills
down in the lounge.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.121
Ethan comes in and says
that there's a situation

39:36.200 --> 39:38.248
- that I need to handle downstairs.
- Mm.

39:38.320 --> 39:43.486
So, I go downstairs,
and I see this tiny little person

39:43.560 --> 39:45.528
in pajamas and slippers,

39:45.600 --> 39:49.047
and she is so, so angry.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.410
Um, I was trying to study.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.566
The moment that I saw you, I knew that
you were someone to take seriously.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.961
What are you gonna do
about work, Will?

40:52.040 --> 40:53.724
Have a nice day, boys!

40:58.840 --> 41:01.320
Hey!
Ooh, it's coming down.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.600
- Look at you.
- Yeah, right?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.243
Look at you.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.283
Oh, yeah.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.806
- Yeah, looks good.
- Well... Thanks.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.522
- So, is anything good here?
- Oh, everything's good here.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.287
Can I get two pork and bean burritos,

41:21.360 --> 41:23.249
four beef machacas,
and two beers?

41:25.080 --> 41:28.004
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm paying for our...

41:28.080 --> 41:29.684
No, you're not.
Tonight's on me.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.881
Hmm.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.725
Mm. Oh, man.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.882
This is my first machaca.
It's great.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.042
- Hey, Dad.
- Mm-hm.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.690
I'm sorry about last week.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.210
Yeah, me too.

41:54.520 --> 41:58.241
Could we get some beer, please?
Two tequila shots.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.169
Let's get hammered.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.241
Cheers.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.400
Drink up.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.486
- Fuck. Yeah, it's all right.
- See?

42:09.560 --> 42:11.360
All right, Dad.
You know why we're doing this?

42:11.400 --> 42:12.561
- Why?
- We're doing this

42:12.720 --> 42:14.324
so that what's-his-name...

42:14.400 --> 42:15.640
- Your...
- Oh, my guy?

42:15.760 --> 42:18.491
James Gentry.
The decision maker.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.331
Right. So James Gentry
can find out who you are.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.165
Yeah.
Who am I?

42:25.400 --> 42:27.289
You're a great man.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.726
You supported me my whole life, Dad.
Let me repay the favor, please.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.207
Okay.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.089
- Okay. Ready?
- Okay.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.487
- Do this again, that makes me know.
- Yeah, okay.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.762
Let's press record.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.571
- Go.
- My name is Roger Davis.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.884
I'm very punctual, and faithful...

42:52.960 --> 42:55.964
Oh, God!
I'm so terrible at this.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.405
God!

42:58.720 --> 43:02.441
I need to do something productive.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.610
Something worthwhile.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.444
Really all it's about.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.527
Do you know, work has always
been more important to me

43:15.680 --> 43:17.523
than anyone else I know?

43:17.680 --> 43:21.082
It just has.
I love it. I love it.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.763
I just need to get into
the employer and see them.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.327
Do you know?
One-on-one.

43:31.480 --> 43:34.563
And if they can just
somehow get to know me,

43:34.720 --> 43:35.846
just even a little bit,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.049
then they would know
why they should hire me.

43:40.480 --> 43:43.484
That is the goal.
That's the goal.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.685
So, anyway, I'm sorry.
I'm blabbering on.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.683
All right, we need to do this.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.491
- All right.
- No, we're good.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.005
No, I'll try it,
I'll try it.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.367
Dad, another time.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.680
All right.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.571
If I drink anymore of this,
this is not going to go well.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.245
- Well, we got six more to go.
- Whoa!

44:05.480 --> 44:06.527
Yeah!

44:07.920 --> 44:09.763
- You did that on purpose, didn't you?
- Whoo!

44:09.840 --> 44:12.161
- Absolutely!
- You did!

44:12.320 --> 44:14.561
You did, too.

44:30.480 --> 44:34.087
- Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett.
- Oh, jeez!

44:34.240 --> 44:36.600
I am sure you're wondering
how I knew that you were in town.

44:36.680 --> 44:39.923
Because you read it
in the <i>LA Times?</i>

44:40.000 --> 44:41.411
Damn it!

44:41.560 --> 44:44.404
Actually, through the use
of GPS triangulation,

44:44.560 --> 44:46.562
my app, the iSearchU,

44:46.720 --> 44:48.324
allowed me to send you a text message

44:48.480 --> 44:50.209
and receive back your exact location,

44:50.360 --> 44:52.647
right down to this stall.
It's incredible!

44:52.800 --> 44:56.043
You know Foursquare
does that already, right?

44:56.200 --> 44:57.486
No, no, no.
You don't get it.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.246
Foursquare lets you
tell other people where you are.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.961
My app tells me where you are
even if you don't want me to know.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.929
It's a game changer, sir, okay?

45:06.080 --> 45:08.128
I'm telling you,
if you say yes right now,

45:08.280 --> 45:11.204
I can promise you
50-50 in my company.

45:14.760 --> 45:16.967
60-40.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.849
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.401
65-35, last offer.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.609
You know...
I like it.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.125
You do?

45:29.280 --> 45:31.442
Let me text my people.

45:31.600 --> 45:33.728
Oh, my God!
I knew that you would like it.

45:33.880 --> 45:36.804
You're the Oracle of Omaha.
You are a visionary like me, sir.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.207
This is incredible.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.850
What the fuck is this?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.570
What the fuck? Hey!

45:42.640 --> 45:43.846
Oh! Hey!

45:43.920 --> 45:45.888
Who has security guards
when they take shits?

45:46.040 --> 45:47.929
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Buffett?

45:48.080 --> 45:50.321
You can't hide
from the iStalkU!

45:50.480 --> 45:52.164
Buffett!

45:53.360 --> 45:56.921
Double-shot white chocolate mocha
with extra cream.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.889
Where are we
on the Fredericks video?

45:59.040 --> 46:01.646
- On schedule for tomorrow afternoon.
- Hmm.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.371
I was hoping for some personal time
tomorrow afternoon.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.081
Say no more.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.041
I will stay late tonight and get it
to you first thing in the morning.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.848
- Uh... Will?
- Mm-hmm?

46:15.960 --> 46:17.928
There are going to be
some changes around here.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.731
- Changes?
- Mm-hm.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.481
I'm taking Wilheimer
into the 21st century.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.085
There will be a new position created,

46:26.160 --> 46:29.482
Vice President
of Corporate Communications.

46:29.560 --> 46:33.007
You keep up the good work,
that Vice President is you.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.289
- Hey, Fernando.
- Fernando.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.725
- Sorry?
- Fernando.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.849
Fernando, right.
Tanya said that I should talk to you.

46:41.920 --> 46:43.524
About what?

46:43.600 --> 46:45.602
I have some extra work
that I'm doing tonight,

46:45.680 --> 46:47.887
and I just need a little help.

46:47.960 --> 46:51.123
- You want me to do your work for you?
- No, no, no.

46:51.200 --> 46:54.283
What I'm saying is that she said
that I should talk to you.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.521
About, you know...

46:58.200 --> 46:59.725
I have ADD.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.246
You know there's
two Fernandos in this office?

47:05.560 --> 47:08.803
Fernando Little,
Director of Client Services,

47:08.880 --> 47:11.486
Division Sales Leader,
three years running.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.483
And Fernando, the janitor.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.647
<i>Mi madre,</i> she's a psychiatrist.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.530
So, I can hook you up
with whatever you need.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.886
Those are drugs.

47:24.640 --> 47:25.926
Saw you last night.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.730
With <i>tu papa.</i>

47:31.400 --> 47:33.129
You're not gonna tell anyone,
are you?

47:35.320 --> 47:37.288
Wasn't close to <i>mi papa.</i>

47:38.320 --> 47:39.731
Your words...

47:41.560 --> 47:42.800
They moved me.

47:47.320 --> 47:50.290
I will take it to the grave.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.962
Now, someone with extra work...

47:55.480 --> 47:58.370
- may I recommend...
- Dexedrine?

48:01.080 --> 48:02.525
Sexy Dexy.

48:03.240 --> 48:07.689
<i>He's an attorney.
And I worked at his legal practice,</i>

48:07.840 --> 48:10.320
<i>as an intern...</i>

48:10.480 --> 48:14.690

48:14.840 --> 48:17.241
<i>So, he would have me deliver...</i>

48:17.400 --> 48:19.448
<i>We started out

48:21.760 --> 48:24.286

48:30.720 --> 48:34.042
<i>...highly employable

48:37.240 --> 48:39.288
I'm Lawrence Wilheimer
and I'm old!

48:39.440 --> 48:41.522
And I don't understand technology
because I'm so old.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.286
So I have Will
clear my browser history every day!

48:45.800 --> 48:46.847
Oh, my God!

48:47.000 --> 48:48.729
<i>- Who's the decision maker?

48:54.920 --> 48:56.888
<i>- You're viral!</i>
- What?

48:57.040 --> 49:00.647
Your Skeezy video has over
114,000 hits on YouTube!

49:00.800 --> 49:02.848
- <i>YouTube?</i>
- Yeah, YouTube.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.041
YouTube? YouTube?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.645
It's fucking YouTube.
Am I saying this wrong?

49:05.800 --> 49:07.165
- Yeah, that's YouTube.
- That's YouTube, right?

49:07.320 --> 49:08.446
- Yeah, that's...
- Yeah, let him know.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.726
It's YouTube, Will!

49:14.720 --> 49:16.245
<i>Well, I structured my business</i>

49:16.400 --> 49:19.563

<i>And even a dental plan.</i>

49:31.320 --> 49:34.210
<i>You can't be having
no toothless bitches!</i>

49:34.360 --> 49:36.966
How much you know about us
as a company, Will?

49:37.160 --> 49:39.208
Uh, absolutely nothing.

49:39.280 --> 49:42.841
Join the club, brother.
We will fix that.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.082
- Sweat Body Spray?
- Yeah.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.605
When kids put that on,

49:46.680 --> 49:48.762
I want them to know
they're sending a message.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.360
- Guess what the message is?
- "I'm cool."

49:51.440 --> 49:53.920
No, the message is,
"I'm down to fuck."

49:54.000 --> 49:57.891
- Oh! Okay.
- Or be fucked.

49:57.960 --> 50:02.045
Uh, hey, Lon. I still don't know
why I'm here exactly.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.043
Why you're here?
I'll tell you why you're here.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.122
You're here because I want you

50:06.200 --> 50:08.726
to head up
our Internet and viral marketing.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.171
You're offering me a job?

50:12.240 --> 50:13.924
I saw the Skeezy D video,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.048
and it blew my fucking mind inside out!

50:16.120 --> 50:17.531
I'm up all night.
I can't sleep

50:17.600 --> 50:20.410
because I'm watching this video
over and over and over again,

50:20.480 --> 50:23.211
screaming at the TV,
"Just tell me what you want me to buy!"

50:24.720 --> 50:26.768
Yeah. Ooh, spank that monkey.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.769
Spank, spank that monkey, yeah.

50:28.840 --> 50:31.047
That's my niece.

50:32.360 --> 50:35.091
All right, so what kind of salary
are we talking?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.766
Mm, okay.
I can offer you 22.

50:37.920 --> 50:40.127
Ooh, that's not a lot.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.485
Will...

50:42.680 --> 50:46.048
We're marketing to kids that were doing
triple irony in kindergarten.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.929
And you...

50:48.080 --> 50:49.525
You are so fucking ironic,

50:49.680 --> 50:52.570
you've gone all the way around
the track, back to authentic.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.166
You're irontic, man.
You're irontic!

50:57.360 --> 50:58.521
"Irontic"?

50:59.920 --> 51:02.924
- Ding-dong! Going down.
- What are you doing?

51:03.120 --> 51:06.761
Will, if you told me to take
our entire marketing budget

51:06.920 --> 51:08.684
and blow it
on a billboard with nothing

51:08.760 --> 51:10.762
but pictures of fat,
veiny cocks, I'd do it!

51:10.960 --> 51:12.371
I'll do whatever you say!

51:12.520 --> 51:15.046
Tell me what to do, man.
Tell me what to do!

51:15.120 --> 51:17.407
Guess who's awesome?

51:17.480 --> 51:20.051
I am. Will is awesome.
I did it.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.963
I stepped up, babe.
I did exactly...

51:22.040 --> 51:24.281
There you are. I did exactly
what you told me to do.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.761
I stepped up big time.
And I got great news for us.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.968
- I got fired.
- What?

51:30.960 --> 51:32.121
I got fired today.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.202
They called me in
to Human Resources,

51:34.320 --> 51:37.608
and I thought I was getting promoted.
That's how stupid I am.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.284
You're not stupid.

51:39.360 --> 51:43.206
Yeah, I am.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.884
I'm V90,000 in debt.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.328
And I spent $779
on a pair of shoes!

51:48.400 --> 51:51.290
It's going to be okay.

51:51.360 --> 51:53.931
No, it's not.
How is this going to be okay?

51:54.000 --> 51:56.810
Because you're gonna...
You're gonna get another job.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.002
I'm sorry, Will...

52:05.960 --> 52:07.962
What are you...
What are we celebrating?

52:13.920 --> 52:16.969
Katherine is gonna
put me up for a promotion.

52:20.880 --> 52:23.087
That's great!
That's great.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.162
At least one of us has a career, right?

52:27.240 --> 52:28.571
Come here.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.168
That's great.

52:33.240 --> 52:36.210
What am I going to do for rent?

52:46.640 --> 52:48.051
Hey, roomie!

52:51.880 --> 52:55.248
FYI, we leave porn laying around,
so just, like, embrace it.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.683
The week started out bad.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.763
My severance ran out.
The mortgage was due.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.402
I pillaged my 401 (k).
I was spiraling.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.087
And then on Tuesday,
I finally get an interview with Xerox.

53:09.200 --> 53:13.125
And I went in there and I killed.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.922
I mean, it was the kind of interview
that you dream about.

53:18.080 --> 53:23.120
And it was so good, that I
remember tearing up in the elevator.

53:23.280 --> 53:26.170
And I knew... I knew they were
gonna send me on to Gentry.

53:26.320 --> 53:29.369
I knew I was finally going to meet
the decision maker.

53:33.320 --> 53:36.290
And ever since then, nothing.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.330
Bupkis.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.248
I just need the bathroom key.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.725
Sorry.

53:51.440 --> 53:52.805
Cammy!

53:53.000 --> 53:54.843
How do I get to James Gentry?

53:55.040 --> 53:57.964
I've e-mailed, I've texted,
I've twittered.

53:58.120 --> 54:00.441
I've called his home.
I spoke to his wife.

54:00.600 --> 54:01.965
You called his house?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.451
Well, the conversation was brief.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.045
It was dinner time.
She had company.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.770
But I think I made an impression!

54:06.920 --> 54:08.960
Maybe you should focus
on more than one job listing.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.809
I'm so perfect for this job!

54:10.960 --> 54:12.962
I just have to get myself
in front of the guy

54:13.120 --> 54:15.964
who can actually pull the trigger
and hire me!

54:16.120 --> 54:18.202
It is ABC time!

54:18.400 --> 54:21.961
One way or another,
I've got to get to the decision maker.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.168
- Yes.
- Whoa!

54:26.560 --> 54:29.928
James Gentry,
prepare to meet Roger Davis.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.400
Yo.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.086
Hey, man.
Listen to my dad's latest tweet.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.366
"It ends today.

54:40.520 --> 54:43.649
"ABC, equal sign,
Annihilation Brings Closure.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.880
"Roger Davis,
symbol for greater than James Gentry."

54:46.000 --> 54:47.160
What the hell does that mean?

54:47.280 --> 54:49.169
<i>I don't know, man,
but it sounds ominous.</i>

54:49.320 --> 54:50.880
Yeah, it definitely doesn't sound good.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.407
Yeah, this is bad.
Look, Luke, we gotta go find my dad.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.885
All right, here I come.

54:57.400 --> 55:00.080
Yeah, it's Fifth and Spring,
right off the 101, big gray building.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.726
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?

55:09.800 --> 55:11.211
Check in with the front desk, please.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.770
Oh, right, right.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.729
All right.
I'll take care of that this afternoon.

55:17.800 --> 55:21.407
All right.
All right, bye-bye.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.970
Good afternoon.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.841
Roger Davis here
to see James Gentry.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.445
You could sign in.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.730
Uh, sir?

55:35.640 --> 55:37.961
I'm going to need you
to exit the building.

55:41.960 --> 55:43.405
Okay.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.561
Or... how about this?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.280
How about I'm not going anywhere

55:53.320 --> 55:56.324
until after I see the decision maker.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.241
Katherine?

56:09.160 --> 56:11.128
- Mr. Wilheimer.
- Ah, yeah.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.441
Look, family emergency.
I need to leave early.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.045
We're starting the Fredericks meeting.

56:15.120 --> 56:16.884
Okay. Well, how important is it
that I'm there?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.803
How important is keeping your job?

56:20.320 --> 56:22.243
Katherine, I'm sorry.
My dad needs me.

56:22.320 --> 56:25.529
Nearest exit, everybody!

56:31.840 --> 56:32.841
Go, <i>mi amigo.</i>

56:32.920 --> 56:35.526
- Wait, did you pull that for me?
- Shh.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.284
Go to <i>tu papa.</i>

56:49.000 --> 56:51.480
- Hurry up!
- He's at Millennium Plaza.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.166
How do you know?

56:55.280 --> 56:57.282
IStalkU, motherfucker!

57:07.240 --> 57:10.289
You can't wait here, sir.
Why don't you find a Starbucks?

57:10.440 --> 57:14.490
Why don't you find
a suck-my-cock-bucks? Hmm?

57:14.560 --> 57:18.167
Sorry.
That was uncalled for.

57:19.080 --> 57:20.525
Where are we going?

57:20.680 --> 57:23.081
It's saying he's, like, around...

57:26.000 --> 57:27.411
I shouldn't have said
what I said.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.211
But I'd like to let you know
that if you call Pearl,

57:30.360 --> 57:32.681
Pearl knows me
and you just tell her...

57:32.880 --> 57:35.042
Hey, hey!
That's my dad.

57:35.200 --> 57:36.200
Will?

57:36.280 --> 57:37.202
Whatever he did,
if you just let him go,

57:37.280 --> 57:39.601
I promise I'll get him home safely.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.525
Look, please, sir.
Don't embarrass him anymore.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.566
Please.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.765
Go on, Mr. Davis.

57:51.920 --> 57:53.126
Thank you.

57:58.280 --> 58:01.250
Wait a minute. That's...
That's Gentry.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.847
That's him.
That's the decision maker.

58:37.680 --> 58:38.886
Dad!

58:45.200 --> 58:46.201
Go!

58:51.400 --> 58:53.528
I was captain
of my Ultimate Frisbee team.

58:53.680 --> 58:54.920
Shut up!

58:55.080 --> 58:57.401
Hold it. Hold it!

58:57.560 --> 58:59.642
Hold it, hold it.
Thank you.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.689
No! Oh!

59:01.840 --> 59:03.171
Hold it, hold on!

59:11.440 --> 59:13.249
Mr. Gentry, my name
is Roger Davis.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.089
Stay away from me.
I'll call security.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.884
They know I'm here.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.930
Now, sir. I know you must think
that I'm psychotic.

59:21.080 --> 59:23.287
I'm not psychotic.
I'm not.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.171
I'm just a man
driven to desperation

59:26.320 --> 59:30.370
by months and months
of rejection and indifference.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.725
I'm a human being,

59:32.920 --> 59:35.366
asking for an opportunity
to tell you face to face

59:35.520 --> 59:39.605
why I think I would be great
for your company.

59:42.800 --> 59:45.610
This is my résumé.
My son made this.

59:47.560 --> 59:49.562
Why me?

59:50.920 --> 59:54.527
Because you, sir,
are the decision maker.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.403
What happened?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.524
I got an interview.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.684
Yeah!

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.603
- Nice!
- All right!

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.445
- All right!
- Yeah!

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.202
Yes!

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.969
What am I gonna do?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.164
There can be only one.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.527
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.284
Katherine wants to see you
in her office.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.766
Fuck.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.330
Goodbye head?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.643
What? No.
What is wrong with you?

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.163
I'm really bored.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.602
Isn't it a glorious day?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.291
What's glorious about it?

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.011
I've rid this company
of the dead wood.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.650
We are leaner and meaner.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.641
This is a contract.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.645
It's a what?

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.041
You're now Vice President
of Corporate Communications.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.285
Your salary is $52,000.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.281
52,000?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.283
You'll be doing the work
of three people.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.124
Get used to eating
dinner at your desk.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.967
Now that I've turned you around,
it was easier to kick you upstairs

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.168
than to train someone new.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.891
Just don't forget
who did the kicking.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.089
- Yeah.
- Come here.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.684
I own you, Mr. Davis.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.963
Get to work, VP.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.485
Yes!

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.080
Why are you massaging
my girlfriend?

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.043
Shh!
Don't break her concentration.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.240
She's about to get
to the Living Legend achievement.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.089
This is fucking crazy, man!
She's on a killing spree.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.287
Killing frenzy.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.568
Your girlfriend
is a fucking prodigy, bro.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.641
Bong me.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.008
You light it.
Light it for her.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.601
"Bong me"?
Hey, what's up with you, man?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.411
I lost a half a million dollars today.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.682
I am fucked.
I let everybody down, dude.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.087
I let Tyler Perry down.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.129
Oprah, Barack Obama...

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.408
I let Barack Obama down.
I am fucked, man.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.245
- Stay with it.
- I'm on it.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.164
You guys don't understand, man.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.767
You guys don't understand.
I drank deer cum!

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.888
- Move!
- Oh, God. Shit!

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.644
Hey, Jillian, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.848
- Boo!
- No.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.445
Okay. All right.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.683
Game over, bitches!

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.250
What are you doing?
You can't do that.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.401
You can't pull the cord out.
Why are you doing that?

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.721
- Boo!
- Don't boo me.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.848
You don't... Don't boo.
Stop booing me!

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.889
I'm surprised at you, Will.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.640
Dude, get out of here.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.569
Sudden trauma can hurt the LED.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.487
Wait, come here.
Save me, save me, save me! I don't...

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.487
- Bong me.
- Bong coming in.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.365
All right, Jillian.
I need you to step up.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.850
Oh, my God.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.289
Bring home the bacon, baby.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.966
Oh, fuck.
Let's eat some bacon right now.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.725
Mr. Diller?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.850
I just want to say
I'm sorry I screwed up.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.721
And thank you for the opportunity and...

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.849
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.122
Where in the fuck
do you think you're going?

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.641
Sit the fuck down.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.284
What kind of fucking pussy generation
do you come from, anyway?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.084
You never apologize.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.766
Never, ever.
You burn the fucking house down,

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.042
you roll up your fucking sleeves
and you build another one.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.441
Now, get the fuck back out there
and make the money back.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.728
You got it?

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.285
Go.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.207
Yo, this will never happen again.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.441
Thank you so much.

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.571
Goddamn it.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.530
Send the fucking custodian in.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.607
Bring it in.
Okay, circle up.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.767
All right. Now, I know
we haven't won a game yet,

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.730
but we have been losing
by less and less.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.929
And I know for a fact that
their two best players have head lice.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.527
I'm saying we have a chance today.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.209
A chance for victory.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.771
A chance for redemption.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.005
Hands in.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.049
Victory on three.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.449
One, two, three.
Victory!

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.040
Great season!
You guys played your hearts out.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.964
You did it.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.404
Everybody is a winner.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.050
We are so proud of you.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.123
Next year, no scoreboard, right?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.203
All right.
Here you go, honey.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.089
No, no, no.
No trophies!

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.686
No, no, no!
No trophies this year.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.330
We always get trophies.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.091
Trophies don't mean anything
unless you earn them.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.969
They're just plastic junk.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.165
Look.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.411
No!

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.451
My childhood bedroom
is filled to the brim with trophies,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.080
and I haven't won a thing in my life.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.845
You would have to be born
already in a coma

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.404
to do as little
with your life as I have.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.961
- Excuse me.
- Stop it, stop! Listen to me.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.281
Listen, guys.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.121
Listen to me.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.889
Now, I've spent the last
five years of my life

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.930
practically living
on a cum-stained couch.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.723
I smoke $200 of weed a week.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.160
I've been wearing the same
pair of socks for so long

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.760
that the fabric of the sock
has literally become one

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.649
with the skin of my little toe.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.041
And why? Why?

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:06.645
Because when I was growing up,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.484
they gave me trophies for losing.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.130
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.840
No trophy, Sam.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.447
Kwan, no trophies!

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.444
No trophies!

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.408
No trophies! No trophies!

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.800
Thanks, Charlie.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.321
Don't call me Charlie.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.130
Call me Coach.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.371
Hey.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.568
- This place is foul.
- I know.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.081
- There's porn everywhere.
- I know.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.321
Look, this is just temporary.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.249
I got a good steady job now.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.210
I mean, I don't want to jinx it,

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.563
but they're talking about
Employee of the Month.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.485
I don't think that's a thing
that people do anymore.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.927
It is.
And I'm gonna get it.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.161
For us.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.282
What I'm saying is,
it's gonna be okay.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.731
♪ <i>Jingle all the way</i>

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.161
♪ <i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.280
♪ <i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i> ♪

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.125
Oh, Will...

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.611
Is this your girlfriend?

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.525
Jillian, this is Katherine Dunn.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.603
- Hello.
- Hi, Jillian.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.402
I think that Jillian
should be thanking me, don't you?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.289
- Thanking you for what?
- For what?

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.408
For what?

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.203
For turning you into the responsible
little worker bee that you are.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.731
- It was very nice to meet you.
- You, too.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.127
- Enjoy the party, dears.
- Okay.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.522
- Wow.
- I know.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.326
But she's making me Vice President.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.089
All signed.
Just got to turn it in.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.003
Where did you find that?

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.562
I called Lon Zimmet.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.130
Um...

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.690
He went on and on about you,

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.207
and used the word "cock"
like, 1,000 times.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.010
Yeah, he does that.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.409
I need to say something.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.209
What?

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.928
I'm 22 years old
and I have no idea

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.082
what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.128
And I'm fine with that.
I have a lot to offer the world,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.329
and this is just the beginning,
and if you want to take a job

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.727
with some shady start-up company
that has nothing to offer you

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.485
but stock options and a dream,
then you should do that!

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.929
Yeah, you know,
maybe we're not all geniuses.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.367
So we're not the greatest generation,
so what?

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.364
These are our lives,
and we're gonna make the most of 'em!

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.129
I love you, Jillian.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.880
Come on, come on.
Don't be shy.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.762
Hey, Katherine,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.966
Sure.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.646
So, I wanted to thank you
for this opportunity.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.801
Oh, pleasure.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.087
But yeah, the job,
it's not really for me.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.247
- You're joking.
- No. I quit.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.281
Wow.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.840
Cocky little shit.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.762
What,
are you gonna go play house

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.966
with that ugly little
girlfriend of yours?

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.326
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you will.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.847
But let me tell you something.
You won't, because you won't have a job.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.604
So I want you to be
prepared for what it

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.722
feels like to be on
the unemployment line.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.691
Because as of this moment forward,
I'm going to do everything in my power

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.331
to ensure that you never work
in this town again.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.767
Hey, put that in your Facebook.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.322
<i>- Should I put my showcase here?
- Yeah, would you?</i>

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.801
I found this working late one night,

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.043
and I thought it was
a good opportunity to express myself.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.171
- Merry Christmas.
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wow!</i>

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.810
<i>Take that minotaur cock.</i>

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.807
<i>Is it tough out there?
No doubt.</i>

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.247
<i>But we all need a job.
So, what do you do?</i>

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.845
Chug, chug, chug!

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.321
<i>Find the thing
that you were meant to do.</i>

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.089
<i>Work your ass off to get it.</i>

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.050
<i>Never stop believing.</i>

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.243
<i>Never quit.</i>

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.561
Hello.
Skeezy D blowin' up the Internet.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.207
Everybody rollin' up to me like,
"How can I roll Skeezy-style?"

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.246
Well, look.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.969
Sweat.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.883
Get your fuck on.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.569
<i>It's a dick!</i>

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.321
Fucking great!

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.683
Will, I'd like to officially welcome you
to the Sweat team.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.127
Thanks, Lon.
Um...

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.043
But I'm gonna have to
turn down your offer.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.121
What?

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.362
I've started my own production
company,

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.205
but I would be honored
to have Sweat as my first client.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.807
Yeah.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.003
<i>In other words,
don't just feel special.</i>

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.760
<i>Be special.</i>

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.323
Do you love your wife?
Of course you do.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.243
But when she tells you
she's going shopping,

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.086
how do you know she's not actually
going to a sordid motel like this one?

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.491
- Hello, lover.
- Hello.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.646
Hmm.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.088
Your husband says he's working late.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.527
Well, what kind of work
are we really talking about?

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.042
Hey, Jezebel, sin.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.729
Come and join the more
than 150,000 satisfied customers

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.531
who have all used iStalkU.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.443
Let your loved ones know you care

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.921
by never letting them
out of your virtual sight.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.930
Oh! Oh...

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.404
And cut!

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.084
We got it.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.685
All right!
