00:32.640 --> 00:33.960
You two should be in bed.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.816
Do you have any idea how late it is?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.600
We just want to see them come past the farm.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.554
There's nothing out there.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640

01:06.680 --> 01:08.751
You do realise
this is a race you signed up for?

01:11.080 --> 01:13.720
I'm really starting to lose
my patience with this lot.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.160
How about giving them a nudge?

01:15.520 --> 01:17.960
If I give 'em a nudge they're gonna wind up
in the next field.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.960
TRUCK HORN BLARES

01:27.760 --> 01:29.976
Don't get me wrong. I'm not averse to us
pushing our weight around

are they?

Kaye. What are you doing here?

03:38.520 --> 03:39.520
Ah...

03:40.520 --> 03:42.034
Seriously good to see you.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.436
I tried calling you but...
- No reception.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.040
Part of the appeal of this place.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.233
So, you here for the surf?

03:50.520 --> 03:52.671
No. No, um...

03:53.840 --> 03:54.840
I need a favour.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.236
This is Michael.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
How's it going?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.634
It's going good, thank you.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.992
What kind of favour are we talking about?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.515
KAYE:
We won't stay for long.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.598
A couple of days, tops.
- No problem.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.353
So do you two work together?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.519
Erm...

04:22.000 --> 04:23.275
It's complicated.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.110
He's a former patient.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.032
Oh right. So...

04:28.600 --> 04:29.829
you and him are...

04:32.720 --> 04:34.757
Err... Yeah.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.480
I mean we didn't get together until
after he'd finished his treatment but...

04:38.920 --> 04:39.920
yeah, we are...

04:41.320 --> 04:43.755
Good for you. I mean it, Kaye.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.152
To hell with medical ethics.
He looks well worth it...

04:49.840 --> 04:51.760
Looks like we're going
to be flatmates for a bit.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.760
Yeah are you sure that's alright?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.555
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

04:57.560 --> 04:58.596
D'you surf?

04:59.320 --> 05:01.073
Never had a chance, but I'm up for it.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.275
Never too late to start.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.875
Michael is still recovering
from a major operation.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.830
Looks fighting fit to me.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
Gross!

05:35.280 --> 05:36.400
JENNY:
Roman are you alright?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.190
Let's get out of the car.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
JENNY:
What happened?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.110
MEGAN:
Zane.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.159
Mum... He's bleeding.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.096
JENNY: Right get the first aid kit.
It's in the car.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.918
ZANE:
I'm alright. I'm alright.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
I'm alright.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.833
JENNY: You're OK.
- ZANE: I'm alright.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.720
MEGAN: Babe, oh my God!
- ZANE GROANS

06:09.960 --> 06:12.919
It's just a cut. Maybe a bit
of concussion. He'll live.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.473
I think we've literally blown a gasket.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520

06:47.680 --> 06:48.680

07:35.760 --> 07:36.760
HANMEI:
I've got a target.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.590
Hold on. Hold on.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.560
LOU: Maybe they thought
we were firing at them.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.355
Let's just give it a minute.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.275
Fire in short bursts.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.616
I'll make a break for the trees,
then circle round.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.120
Excuse me, you're going to do what?

07:57.760 --> 07:58.876
Get us a new set of wheels.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.435
Roman, put the gun down.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.776
Yeah.
- We're gonna find a solution

08:01.800 --> 08:03.598
that doesn't involve
senseless violence.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.400
That Hot hatch isn't going
to flip over by itself.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.515
We don't need their help, Mum.
We can do it, you and me.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.400
ROMAN:
Mum... what are you doing? Get back!

08:14.920 --> 08:16.400
RUBY:
They're trying to kill us...

08:16.800 --> 08:18.200
MEGAN: Mum...
- LOU: Female.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.072
Looks like you've got
a bit of engine trouble.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
That's right.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.593
I was wondering if we might be able

08:55.640 --> 08:58.633
to come to some sort of mutually
beneficial arrangement.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.754
Go on.
- JENNY: Well...

09:03.320 --> 09:04.754
You've got two vehicles.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.749
Both of them in
various states of disrepair.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.596
You only need one.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.717
What if we help you flip the car over

09:12.960 --> 09:15.191
then you let us take
what we need from the truck?

09:18.720 --> 09:19.756
DOG PANTS
- HANMEI: Hey.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.709
Louise Collins.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
People call me Lou.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.672
Jennifer Donahue. Jenny.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.319
This is Roman. My youngest.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.395
He was meant to be getting ready
for his GCSEs but, well...

09:38.680 --> 09:41.240
we've had to put that on the back burner
for various reasons.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.158
And that's Meg, my daughter.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.680
At first she was against the race but...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.276
actually she's responded
remarkably well.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.056
JENNY: Oh and that's her boyfriend Zane...
- What is she doing?

09:52.080 --> 09:54.920
JENNY:...he doesn't say much...
- She gets like this when she's nervous.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.616
JENNY CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY
- Really embarrassing time

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
to be related to her.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.473
JENNY:
Oh and... that's Ruby.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.080
She was meant to be racing with her sister
but they had a row about something.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.640
She can come across as a bit
hostile when you first meet her...

10:06.920 --> 10:08.456
Oh and you've already met my dog...
- LOU: Yeah.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.153
I don't need to know
the name of your dog.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.273
You're good people, I get it.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
Let's roll.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.553
ROMAN:
How can it weigh this much?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.038
Depleted uranium alloy.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.950
Knock yourself out.

10:32.920 --> 10:33.956
D'you reckon it'll fit?

10:34.520 --> 10:35.636
I'm not a mechanic, Meg.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.776
Once I've mastered the basic principles
of the combustion engine

10:38.800 --> 10:39.836
I'll let you know.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
It'll fit.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.990
Mm-hm.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.520
HE SIGHS

11:09.960 --> 11:10.960
Hey.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.480
Hey.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.790
Is he bothering you?

11:15.960 --> 11:17.679
Oh... It's OK. I like dogs.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.440
ROMAN:
I figured you'd be more of a cat person.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.836
What made you think that?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.911
I don't know. I just supposed...

11:29.960 --> 11:31.155
Cats are selfish.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.560
They only think about themselves.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.479
Dogs have a personality.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.870
They're loyal and obedient.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.320
I don't know about that...

11:38.160 --> 11:40.595
Brutus, he can be
well behaved most of the time

11:41.160 --> 11:43.400
but the minute he sees a squirrel,
pfft, forget about it.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.999
LOU:
Ugly little fuckers, aren't they?

11:56.480 --> 11:58.437
You know, it was the strangest thing.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.359
He just walked
straight out into the road.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.115
Maybe he did it on purpose.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.536
Wouldn't you want to die,
if you turned into one of them?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.960
I'm not planning on doing that.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.355
I'm going to win this race.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.200
You seem pretty sure about that.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.840
No doubt in my mind.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.792
This time tomorrow me
and my family, be gazing up at the stars.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.160
That's why we're doing this.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.600

12:27.680 --> 12:28.909

I have to. Mum needs me.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.919
I need you. Michael needs you.
You definitely need him.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.320
I can't.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.633
I feel like something's wrong.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.356
It's like she's got a hold on you.
SHE SIGHS

13:29.280 --> 13:30.316
She's in trouble.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.800
Listen.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.920
I want you to do something for me.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.877
It's really important
that Michael stays here.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.033
Well, that's easier said than done.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.080
He strikes me as the kind of person
who does what he wants.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.521
Then you're just gonna have to find a way
to persuade him.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.436
Can you do that for me?

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
Sure.

What?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.958
Did she say anything before she left?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.920
If you turn up at Kiloran that could
be seriously bad for her career.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.440
She could get struck off.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.560
She doesn't want you there, Michael.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.715

Clearly it's something else.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.936
I thought you said the problem was
with the battery?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.656
The problem was with the battery,
but we couldn't find any other problem

15:21.680 --> 15:22.936
because the main battery was flat.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.155
So what's the problem now?

15:24.280 --> 15:25.919
I don't know, Mum.
I'm not a mechanic.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.759
Well, you're good with computers.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
They're machines.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.280

16:19.680 --> 16:20.716

16:21.560 --> 16:24.871
how I'm feeling? Let me tell you,
it's not nice.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.031
I don't care about you or your settings.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.278

17:42.360 --> 17:43.999
Oh, this is serious guys.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.776
That's true, but it would be

18:14.440 --> 18:16.238

18:16.560 --> 18:18.438

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600

31:26.800 --> 31:28.120
I've got an idea.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.031
Wait for the signal
and then open the latch.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.476
What's the signal?

We can't just leave.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.719
Ruby, get in the car.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.976
None of this would have happened
if it wasn't for us.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.150
We've got to do something.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.039
I know how you feel!

32:13.200 --> 32:16.272
But there is nothing we can do
right here. Right now.

Forty metres...

32:51.880 --> 32:52.880

32:53.640 --> 32:54.640
Why can't we see them?

33:20.800 --> 33:21.995
Is everything alright?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.200
We heard shooting.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.760
Yeah... There's going to be a lot more
where that came from.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.560
Right, maybe we should wait inside the car.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.716
Good idea.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.520
CREATURE MOVES IN TREES
- CREATURE SNARLS

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
ROMAN:
They're close.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.160
It looks like there is six of them.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.074
You should be able to see them now.

Something's wrong.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.200
Maybe you caught your leg on something
as you were coming in.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.713
I thought they'd got me but I'm OK...

36:31.920 --> 36:33.070

THUNDER RUMBLES

36:45.840 --> 36:47.056
I'm gonna get out of the car now.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.356
You can't do that, Ruby. I won't let you.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.236
I hope you make it.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.680
I mean that.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.440

39:42.520 --> 39:43.590
I'm so sorry.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.720
There's nothing to be sorry about.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
I do...

39:49.000 --> 39:50.150
I really do...

39:53.200 --> 39:55.157
I told Michael you didn't love him

39:57.240 --> 39:58.560
and that you weren't coming back.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.072
He thinks you don't care about him.
