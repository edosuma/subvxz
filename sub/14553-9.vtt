WEBVTT

00:51.443 --> 00:53.934
I mean, sometimes you see
a person on the street

00:54.047 --> 00:57.003
who's in a state of life
that you couldn't imagine

00:57.116 --> 00:58.171
having the courage to live.

00:58.284 --> 01:00.007
You ever seen somebody...

01:00.120 --> 01:01.909
you ever seen a person
and you look at them and you go,

01:02.022 --> 01:04.846
"That-- I would just kill myself
if I woke up like that"?

01:04.959 --> 01:06.647
I would just kill myself.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.015
I don't have the courage.

01:08.128 --> 01:10.117
And it's a comment on me,
not them.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.586
I couldn't live like that.

01:11.699 --> 01:14.722
I get to go like this,
and if I had to go like this,

01:14.835 --> 01:16.323
I'd blow my brains out.

01:16.436 --> 01:18.492
I can't do it.

01:18.605 --> 01:21.495
I have only the courage
for a perfect life.

01:21.608 --> 01:23.731
I really do.

01:23.844 --> 01:26.902
Anything below perfect,
I ain't doing it.

01:27.015 --> 01:28.805
I ain't being
one of those guys.

01:28.918 --> 01:30.907
I don't even want to be cold
in the winter.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.242
You know when you see somebody,

01:32.355 --> 01:34.845
they just have a flannel shirt
without a jacket,

01:34.958 --> 01:37.760
and they're just being cold and
their face is purple in spots.

01:39.496 --> 01:41.018
Couldn't do it.

01:41.131 --> 01:43.287
I saw an old lady
I couldn't be.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.523
I was walking behind this lady.

01:45.636 --> 01:48.225
That is a weird sentence.

01:48.338 --> 01:52.329
"I saw an old lady
that I couldn't be."

01:52.442 --> 01:54.632
I was walking behind her

01:54.745 --> 01:57.835
and she had just
a spine that was

01:57.948 --> 01:59.403
just dog shit.

01:59.516 --> 02:03.140
Her spine sucked ass.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.743
I'm saying this in--
Like, as her friend.

02:05.856 --> 02:08.212
Her spine...

02:08.325 --> 02:10.182
sucked dick.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.485
Just-- She was
just one of these people

02:13.598 --> 02:17.323
and she's walking in front of me
like this

02:17.436 --> 02:20.394
and she had a collar on
her shirt that was very high,

02:20.507 --> 02:21.862
and so I couldn't even
see her head.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.098
She had--
Looked like she had no head.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.934
She was like this with
no head and I remember--

02:27.047 --> 02:29.871
First thing I thought was,
her doctor's an asshole,

02:29.984 --> 02:33.175
because he could have told her!

02:33.295 --> 02:35.476
He could have said to her,
"Listen, just so you know,

02:35.596 --> 02:37.621
"Now that you're like this,

02:38.627 --> 02:40.895
"if you wear a high collar...

02:45.335 --> 02:49.661
"... it's spooky for people
behind you.

02:49.774 --> 02:53.532
"It's spooky from the back...

02:53.645 --> 02:56.502
"sad from the front

02:56.615 --> 02:58.804
and kind of
funny from the side."

02:58.917 --> 02:59.839
Anyway, thanks a lot,
good night.

02:59.952 --> 03:00.785
Thank you very much.

03:13.330 --> 03:14.964
Louie C.K.!

03:20.003 --> 03:21.524
Holy shit!
How are you, man?

03:21.637 --> 03:23.026
How's it going?
Oh, my God!

03:23.139 --> 03:24.595
Eddie!
How are you?

03:24.708 --> 03:26.730
I haven't seen you in-- Jesus Christ!
Oh, it's years.

03:26.843 --> 03:28.933
It's been years.
Oh, my God.

03:29.046 --> 03:30.601
You're doing good, man.

03:30.714 --> 03:31.870
You're a big star now.

03:31.983 --> 03:33.071
Oh, not really.

03:33.184 --> 03:35.407
Bullshit, I see you on TV.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.877
You know, when I can afford
a motel room.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.445
I thought you'd
forget about me.

03:39.558 --> 03:41.748
How am I gonna
forget about you, man?

03:41.861 --> 03:44.150
Hey, man, pretty funny stuff.

03:44.263 --> 03:45.518
Thanks.

03:45.631 --> 03:47.220
I'm Louie.
I'm Eddie.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.267
Just starting out, too.

03:51.638 --> 03:52.826
It's good to see you, man.

03:52.939 --> 03:53.993
This is--

03:54.106 --> 03:56.229
Gregg Rogell,
this is Eddie Mack,

03:56.342 --> 03:57.998
he's a comic, he's a friend,
we started out together.

03:58.111 --> 03:59.966
Oh, cool, nice to meet you, Eddie.
What's up?

04:00.079 --> 04:01.935
Where do you work out of, LA?

04:02.048 --> 04:05.306
Oh, yeah, because if it's
not here, it has to be LA.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.542
You know, there's a whole
middle of the country.

04:07.655 --> 04:08.676
You know,
the sewers of America,

04:08.789 --> 04:10.011
that's where I work,

04:10.124 --> 04:12.280
y'know, places that you
wouldn't be welcome,

04:12.393 --> 04:13.883
phony New York piece of shit.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.385
Hey, man, watch your mouth.

04:15.498 --> 04:16.886
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I offend you?

04:16.999 --> 04:18.188
Hey...

04:18.301 --> 04:19.322
You started out with this guy?
Yeah.

04:19.435 --> 04:21.025
Yeah, we started out
back in the days

04:21.138 --> 04:23.294
when people went
on stage to be funny,

04:23.407 --> 04:25.462
and then he came here
to have a career

04:25.575 --> 04:28.099
with dildos like you
and I worked the road,

04:28.212 --> 04:30.467
working shit holes for
drug money, like real comics.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.071
Oh, I get it, so you're a road head?
Yeah, yeah, and I'm really proud of it.

04:34.184 --> 04:36.373
Unfunny.

04:36.486 --> 04:38.821
Okay, well, it was nice
talking to you, loser.

04:42.392 --> 04:44.381
Come on.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.983
Let's get a drink, man, come upstairs.
I can't, I can't, I'm double-parked.

04:47.096 --> 04:48.351
Where you--
Where you going?

04:48.464 --> 04:50.287
I can't afford to stop
in this city.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.089
It's 50 bucks
an hour to exist here.

04:53.202 --> 04:54.657
I'm on my way to Maine,

04:54.770 --> 04:56.693
I just wanted to stop in
and say hello.

04:56.806 --> 04:58.061
What are you doing?

04:58.174 --> 04:59.629
Do you want a-- do you want a ride?
Yeah.

04:59.742 --> 05:01.998
I wanted to talk to you
for a while, if you have--

05:02.111 --> 05:03.666
Okay, yeah,
absolutely, come on, man.

05:03.779 --> 05:05.768
Let's go.
I'll give you a ride home.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.237
Tiger Woods claims to be
addicted to sex.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.806
Bullshit.

05:09.919 --> 05:11.975
These are hot women he was
having sex with.

05:12.088 --> 05:13.944
If he was having
sex with a dead chicken,

05:14.057 --> 05:17.093
then I'd say, "Wow, that guy
is addicted to sex."

05:23.301 --> 05:25.624
Boy, you're really
living out of this car.

05:25.737 --> 05:28.827
Yeah, I've been sleeping
in it for over a year.

05:28.940 --> 05:29.995
Got everything.

05:30.108 --> 05:31.663
I'm set up.

05:31.776 --> 05:35.634
Got a sleeping bag,
hot plate, box of porn,

05:35.747 --> 05:37.636
old-school magazine porn.

05:37.749 --> 05:39.004
Gas station porn.

05:39.117 --> 05:41.018
You might not
want to touch that.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.243
So you're doing a gig in Maine?

05:45.356 --> 05:46.678
Yeah, you want to open for me?

05:46.791 --> 05:50.148
It's a sports bar
in Bangor for 200 bucks,

05:50.261 --> 05:52.083
then I'm done.

05:52.196 --> 05:53.852
What, you're getting off
the road for a while?

05:53.965 --> 05:55.520
No, I mean, I'm done.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.400
Done and done.

06:01.105 --> 06:02.973
I'm gonna hit this
liquor store up here.

06:05.410 --> 06:09.701
I would like to die
from... you.

06:09.814 --> 06:11.636
And you're drinking this with me, too.
I don't know, man.

06:11.749 --> 06:12.804
Yes, you are.
No.

06:12.917 --> 06:14.272
You remember how we
used to get hammered.

06:14.385 --> 06:16.174
Yes, I remember.

06:16.287 --> 06:20.378
Man, you ate it
up there tonight.

06:20.491 --> 06:23.881
Yeah, I know I suck, man.

06:23.994 --> 06:25.416
You don't suck.

06:25.529 --> 06:26.750
They suck!

06:26.863 --> 06:28.285
Don't...

06:28.398 --> 06:31.688
don't let other people
tell you what you are, man.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.623
Don't do that.

06:33.736 --> 06:35.992
You're good.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.738
You're funny!

06:43.278 --> 06:45.033
Oh, Jesus, drink with me,
I'm serious.

06:45.146 --> 06:47.335
You're not gonna see me
again after this, believe me.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.170
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.304
You gotta pay for that, mister.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.206
Yeah, I'm paying
for it there, relax.

06:52.319 --> 06:53.808
Pinch it off, lady bird.

06:53.921 --> 06:56.544
Can I enjoy it for ten seconds
before I own it?

06:56.657 --> 06:58.380
You can't drink in here,
it's not a bar.

06:58.493 --> 07:00.682
Why don't you shut your hummus
hole there, curry monkey?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.485
I'm gonna pay for it. What the ( bleep
) are you talking about, curry monkey?

07:03.598 --> 07:05.253
<i>You no soy--
Yo no soy árabe.</i>

07:05.366 --> 07:07.389
<i>ÿ Qué clase de mierda es esto?
What is that, Spanish?</i>

07:07.502 --> 07:08.590
<i>What are you saying--
Oye.</i>

07:08.703 --> 07:10.092
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

07:10.205 --> 07:12.728
Are you saying that Spanish
people don't eat hummus?

07:12.841 --> 07:14.898
Are you saying Spanish people

07:15.011 --> 07:16.711
<i>don't like Middle Eastern food?
Oye, oye, p'al carajo, get out of here.</i>

07:18.047 --> 07:20.403
<i>Oye, chico.
You keep the change.</i>

07:20.516 --> 07:23.205
<i>Yo no soy árabe, sal p'al-- Sal p'al carajo.
I'll keep the change, I'll keep your change.</i>

07:23.318 --> 07:24.941
<i>Y llévate--
Y vete pa' allá.</i>

07:25.054 --> 07:27.076
<i>Yeah, you and your friend,
pa' fuera, maricón.</i>

07:27.189 --> 07:28.478
<i>Yeah, I know what that means.
Pa' fuera.</i>

07:28.591 --> 07:29.779
<i>I'll find out what
that means Llévatelo.</i>

07:29.892 --> 07:31.414
And I'm gonna come back
to your bar.

07:31.527 --> 07:33.449
I'm gonna slander your bar
on the Internet. Very sorry.

07:33.562 --> 07:36.352
<i>One star for your bar, this bar sucks!
Mierda, mierda, mierda.</i>

07:36.465 --> 07:38.187
Let's go, man.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.334
<i>I'm on Facebook!
Aquí, si, pa' fuera, pa' fuera.</i>

07:51.852 --> 07:53.852
You almost look like
you're having fun.

07:56.523 --> 07:57.879
Wah!
Jesus Christ.

07:57.992 --> 08:00.014
Let's do a set somewhere.
You wanna go on stage?

08:00.127 --> 08:01.717
Yeah, hang on.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.219
Let's find a gig.

08:04.332 --> 08:06.054
Let's find a gig.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.491
We could do Caroline's,
the midnight show.

08:08.604 --> 08:10.593
We're not doing a comedy club.

08:10.706 --> 08:13.663
Comedy clubs, that's
where comedy goes to die.

08:13.776 --> 08:15.399
Let's do an open mic.
Uh...

08:15.512 --> 08:18.001
Like we used to, have some n.

08:18.114 --> 08:20.804
Yeah... right there.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.373
That's tonight.

08:22.486 --> 08:23.907
That's in Brooklyn.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.209
And I have a car.

08:25.322 --> 08:26.977
Wah, come on.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.780
Jesus, man, come on.
Give me this, give me this.

08:29.893 --> 08:31.227
I'm driving.
All right, okay.

08:32.863 --> 08:34.851
Brooklyn.

08:34.964 --> 08:37.466
That's the bridge, that's the bridge.
There you go.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.324
I called my ex-wife, right,
and told her what happened,

08:40.437 --> 08:42.226
you know, that I didn't want to
be alone tonight.

08:42.339 --> 08:44.361
And she was like,
"Things are different, okay?

08:44.474 --> 08:46.530
You want to be with me,
it's gonna cost you $200."

08:46.643 --> 08:48.931
And I was like, wow, things are
different, man.

08:49.044 --> 08:51.067
I remember when
she used to charge me 60,

08:51.180 --> 08:52.468
which is a problem, man,
'cause, you know,

08:52.581 --> 08:53.879
every woman wants to
have a man in here life,

08:53.992 --> 08:54.993
you know what I mean?

08:55.106 --> 08:56.472
But not a fat one.

08:56.585 --> 08:59.875
It's not like when I walk by,
you hear women going...

08:59.988 --> 09:01.811
<i>"Oye, mira, papi.</i>

09:01.924 --> 09:04.247
<i>"Coño.</i>

09:04.360 --> 09:07.283
Teniqua,
did you see that guy ?"

09:07.396 --> 09:08.751
"I sure did and let me tell you
something,

09:08.864 --> 09:10.153
"if I had him in my bed,

09:10.266 --> 09:11.387
"I'd suck his cholesterol level
back to normal,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.124
you know what
I'm saying ?"

09:14.237 --> 09:16.793
This is open mic.

09:16.906 --> 09:19.029
Smell the desperation.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.098
Loserdom.

09:21.211 --> 09:23.267
Like, a girl could do
something seemingly gay

09:23.380 --> 09:25.636
and it'll be okay if she does it
with another woman,

09:25.749 --> 09:27.204
but if I suggest
I want to suck my friend's dick

09:27.317 --> 09:29.884
because he's stressed,
I can't suck his dick.

09:31.820 --> 09:35.411
Well, I'm immigrant from Russia

09:35.524 --> 09:37.946
and America
experiencing hard times now,

09:38.059 --> 09:40.115
how to survive and
this and that...

09:40.228 --> 09:43.919
I'm telling you, you're really
making me feel good, like...

09:44.032 --> 09:46.088
like I felt when they
finally took that head rag

09:46.201 --> 09:48.191
off Aunt Jemima on
the pancake box.

09:48.304 --> 09:49.893
I feel good, I feel good.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.194
Yeah.

09:51.307 --> 09:52.563
You seriously want to
go on stage here?

09:52.676 --> 09:53.998
Yeah, yeah.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.434
Hey, you're Louie C.K. Yeah.

09:56.547 --> 09:58.837
You're famous in this dump.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.872
Do you want to go up?

10:00.985 --> 10:02.674
No, but can you
put my friend on?

10:02.787 --> 10:04.142
He's funny, he's a comic.
I'll go up.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.510
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:05.623 --> 10:06.644
What's your name?

10:06.757 --> 10:09.781
It's Shitty Fat Tits.

10:09.894 --> 10:11.649
Write that down.

10:11.762 --> 10:13.384
Yeah, sure.

10:13.497 --> 10:14.852
I'm gonna go now,

10:14.965 --> 10:16.820
but I'll be in the back
so we can exchange...

10:16.933 --> 10:18.855
Don't ( bleep ) up my intro.

10:18.968 --> 10:22.091
Up next, we got a very special
guest, doing a guest spot.

10:22.204 --> 10:26.374
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Shitty Fat Tits.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.665
Oh, no, thank you,
thank you very much.

10:29.778 --> 10:31.467
No, seriously, thank you,
thank you.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.202
Your host,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:33.315 --> 10:34.904
Please, give it up.

10:35.017 --> 10:36.305
He should.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.175
Anyway, do you know
how much stupid stuff we do

10:39.288 --> 10:40.877
just to get pussy?

10:40.990 --> 10:43.413
Sex is just so absolutely
boring.

10:43.526 --> 10:46.316
It's such a one-note thing
and it drives so many people

10:46.429 --> 10:49.253
to do so many ridiculous...

10:49.366 --> 10:50.621
So many problems--

10:50.734 --> 10:52.156
Sex is like--
It's not even like--

10:52.269 --> 10:53.859
It's gross.

10:53.972 --> 10:55.561
If you just break it down to
what it is,

10:55.674 --> 10:58.464
if you're not in
the mood for it and you just--

10:58.577 --> 10:59.866
It's disgusting.

10:59.979 --> 11:03.602
Do you ever watch porno
after you come?

11:03.715 --> 11:05.571
Ugh.

11:05.684 --> 11:08.374
I get a boner, it springs up
on me randomly,

11:08.487 --> 11:11.277
I treat it like
the medical condition that it is

11:11.390 --> 11:14.280
and I drain it like a cyst,
quickly.

11:14.393 --> 11:15.448
Drain this off!

11:15.561 --> 11:17.550
No, just squeeze it off!

11:17.663 --> 11:19.652
30-second MPEG.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.387
And if you use YouPorn,
be careful,

11:21.500 --> 11:23.089
'cause they track
what you beat off to.

11:23.202 --> 11:24.591
It's a--

11:24.704 --> 11:27.460
Go up to the top of YouPorn next
time you're on YouPorn

11:27.573 --> 11:29.395
and click on
"recommended for you."

11:29.508 --> 11:31.698
They track what you beat off to,
it's like Amazon.

11:31.811 --> 11:33.500
"People who beat off
to this also beat off to

11:33.613 --> 11:34.835
this, this and that."

11:34.948 --> 11:37.370
And a lot of that stuff
you're not into.

11:37.483 --> 11:40.507
How is, y'know,
cock and ball torture

11:40.620 --> 11:42.676
equivalent to peeing on me?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.211
I don't want you to pee on me.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.759
That's gross.

11:48.295 --> 11:49.529
No idea what
I'm doing with my life.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.481
I can't believe you didn't go on, man.
Man, you were great.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.083
Eat my ass.
You were hilarious.

12:02.196 --> 12:04.385
Stop it.

12:04.498 --> 12:06.121
You know, I give you shit,

12:06.234 --> 12:08.656
but you know
I'm proud of you, right?

12:08.769 --> 12:10.859
You came out here
and you gave it a shot

12:10.972 --> 12:13.062
and now it's working for you.

12:13.175 --> 12:14.976
I've always been proud of you.

12:19.247 --> 12:21.303
Hey, man.
What's up?

12:21.416 --> 12:23.705
I got some news.

12:23.818 --> 12:25.906
I'm gonna be on Letterman.

12:26.019 --> 12:27.141
Oh, yeah?

12:27.254 --> 12:28.642
Yeah, I just got the call.

12:28.755 --> 12:31.236
All right, well, whatever.

12:33.193 --> 12:35.215
What?
What?

12:35.328 --> 12:38.828
Good, go do Letterman.

12:38.941 --> 12:39.942
What's your problem?

12:40.055 --> 12:41.187
I just thought we do this shit

12:41.300 --> 12:42.956
to get off and find truth,

12:43.069 --> 12:47.027
not to become
famous glamour monkeys.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.328
Hey, man--
Whatever, dude.

12:48.441 --> 12:50.243
Go be a star.

13:06.194 --> 13:07.616
Are you drinking water?

13:07.729 --> 13:09.117
Is that for your health?

13:09.230 --> 13:11.486
Keep your skin tight for
the camera close-ups?

13:11.599 --> 13:13.488
You're making fun of water
right now, okay. Yes.

13:13.601 --> 13:15.923
It's a basic life sustenance
and you're making fun of it.

13:16.036 --> 13:17.291
Yeah, so what's your point?

13:17.404 --> 13:20.395
Well, when you find yourself
railing against water,

13:20.508 --> 13:21.863
you know, get a grip, man.

13:21.976 --> 13:23.965
Jesus Christ.

13:24.078 --> 13:27.414
Goddamn it, this city
is a dumparoo.

13:29.551 --> 13:32.008
I bet you never come out
here, do you, Brooklyn?

13:32.121 --> 13:33.976
You just stay holed up
in faggy Manhattan.

13:34.089 --> 13:35.945
I used to live here, man.
Yeah.

13:36.058 --> 13:39.349
Yeah, I lived in a five-floor
walk-up for two years

13:39.462 --> 13:41.952
with my ex-wife.

13:42.065 --> 13:44.555
The Twin Towers were right
there across the river. Oh.

13:44.668 --> 13:46.190
She was six months
pregnant with Lily

13:46.303 --> 13:50.862
and we stood there
and we watched them burn.

13:50.975 --> 13:53.632
You just stood there
and watched them burn?

13:53.745 --> 13:55.034
You didn't try to help?

13:55.147 --> 13:57.281
Rush in?
Try to blow it out?

13:58.650 --> 13:59.705
Nothing?

13:59.818 --> 14:01.908
Come on, help our
3,000 brothers out, man.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.709
Just stand there and watch
'em burn

14:03.822 --> 14:07.159
with your fattened wife
who you later abandoned.

14:15.101 --> 14:17.369
So what's up, man?

14:18.804 --> 14:22.662
Uh... okay, look.

14:22.775 --> 14:25.565
I know I burned
our bridge, you know,

14:25.678 --> 14:27.700
we're old friends and all that,
hooray.

14:27.813 --> 14:30.970
But I got no bridges left.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.639
I burned all the bridges,

14:32.752 --> 14:35.008
I burned the roads,
I burned the trails,

14:35.121 --> 14:38.077
I burned the hiking path.

14:38.190 --> 14:39.812
It's all gone.

14:39.925 --> 14:41.447
So what do you need?

14:41.560 --> 14:43.083
I don't need anything.

14:43.196 --> 14:45.051
I just want to talk to you.

14:45.164 --> 14:46.286
I want to tell you something.
Okay.

14:46.399 --> 14:49.088
Do ya, okay?
Yeah, I'm listening.

14:49.201 --> 14:51.357
Go ahead. All right, look,
man, I'm cashing in.

14:51.470 --> 14:52.859
I'm done.

14:52.972 --> 14:54.995
I'm 40 shit years old,

14:55.108 --> 14:57.097
I got nothing, I got nobody.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.732
And I don't want anything,

14:58.845 --> 15:00.601
I don't want anybody,

15:00.714 --> 15:03.670
and that's the worst part,
when the want goes.

15:03.783 --> 15:05.639
That's-- That's bad.

15:05.752 --> 15:07.774
I mean, like suffering
is one thing

15:07.887 --> 15:10.410
or not having is one thing

15:10.523 --> 15:13.814
but when you just
don't care anymore?

15:13.927 --> 15:15.382
You know, I've gone soft

15:15.495 --> 15:18.551
in the last three pussies
I've been in.

15:18.664 --> 15:20.153
You get to
a point where you go,

15:20.266 --> 15:22.322
maybe it's time to just
put a period

15:22.435 --> 15:24.124
at the end of my--

15:24.237 --> 15:25.971
Whatever this was.

15:27.707 --> 15:30.130
So you're gonna quit comedy?

15:30.243 --> 15:31.932
How dense are you?

15:32.045 --> 15:33.600
Comedy?

15:33.713 --> 15:36.169
Who gives a shit
about comedy, man?

15:36.282 --> 15:38.838
Well, then, what are you talking about?
My life!

15:38.951 --> 15:40.719
I'm going to end it.

15:45.884 --> 15:46.885
I went to a doctor--

15:46.998 --> 15:48.247
Listen to me.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.615
I went to a doctor,
and I'm just trying to

15:49.728 --> 15:51.183
get a scrip for Ambien,
and I'm--

15:51.296 --> 15:52.551
I'm bullshitting the guy,

15:52.664 --> 15:55.420
the whole fear
of flying nonsense,

15:55.533 --> 15:58.390
like I've ever been on
a plane in my career,

15:58.503 --> 16:01.393
and the doctor gets this
look on his face like he knows,

16:01.506 --> 16:04.396
like he's gonna chuck me
out of the office.

16:04.509 --> 16:08.848
All of a sudden...
he gives me these.

16:10.315 --> 16:12.471
It's "phenomedrine."
What is it?

16:12.584 --> 16:15.207
He tells me, only take
one of these a week.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.876
It's like the strongest,
most dangerous shit

16:17.989 --> 16:19.545
this side of Bangkok.

16:19.658 --> 16:21.847
He tells me,
"Do not take more than one.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.417
Two of these'll
stop your heart."

16:24.530 --> 16:27.420
A doctor gave you those?
Yeah, it made no sense at first.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.288
I mean, look at me.

16:29.401 --> 16:31.291
You take one look at me,

16:31.404 --> 16:33.626
you're gonna give me these
with a verbal warning?

16:33.739 --> 16:35.161
Why would he do that?

16:35.274 --> 16:36.796
Because he took one look at me

16:36.909 --> 16:39.132
and he realized
that's the only prescription

16:39.245 --> 16:42.214
that's gonna improve my life,
is death.

16:44.284 --> 16:45.573
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

16:45.686 --> 16:46.907
No, the guy's right.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.410
The guy probably
deserves a Nobel Prize

16:49.523 --> 16:51.311
and I don't need
a second opinion.

16:51.424 --> 16:53.781
I'm going to Maine,
I'm gonna do my show,

16:53.894 --> 16:55.950
get a lobster roll, maybe,

16:56.063 --> 16:57.285
get a motel room

16:57.398 --> 16:59.453
and then throw three of these
things down my head

16:59.566 --> 17:00.788
with some cognac.

17:00.901 --> 17:02.857
Why are you here
telling me this right now?

17:02.970 --> 17:05.827
You know...
I don't know.

17:05.940 --> 17:09.564
I guess I just wanted to
say goodbye to someone.

17:09.677 --> 17:10.898
You know, if I leave a note,

17:11.011 --> 17:13.701
it's just gonna get
burned with my clothes,

17:13.814 --> 17:16.671
so I figured you for the one
guy that

17:16.784 --> 17:18.266
I could say adios to.

17:18.379 --> 17:19.379
Eddie, this is bullshit.

17:19.492 --> 17:20.635
You can't kill yourself.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.749
Oh, yes, I can.

17:21.862 --> 17:23.311
I have a note from a doctor.

17:23.424 --> 17:25.914
I don't give a shit what that
guy said, you can't do that.

17:26.027 --> 17:27.449
And why can't I do that?

17:27.562 --> 17:29.196
Because!

17:30.998 --> 17:32.554
Louie, look me in the eye

17:32.667 --> 17:35.035
and tell me I have
one good reason to live.

17:46.214 --> 17:47.436
No.

17:47.549 --> 17:48.670
See, you got nothing.

17:48.783 --> 17:50.439
No, no, I'm not--

17:50.552 --> 17:52.407
I'm not playing that,
I'm not doing it.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.042
What do you mean?
I mean...

17:54.155 --> 17:57.012
I mean, ( bleep ) you, man.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.313
I got my reasons to live,

17:58.426 --> 17:59.948
I worked hard to
figure out what they are.

18:00.061 --> 18:02.050
I'm not just handing them
to you.

18:02.163 --> 18:04.185
Okay, you want
a reason to live?

18:04.298 --> 18:06.487
Have a drink of water
and get some sleep,

18:06.600 --> 18:08.422
wake up in the morning and try
again like everybody else does.

18:08.535 --> 18:10.024
Yeah, I get it,
a tough-love fix--

18:10.137 --> 18:12.259
No, no love, okay?

18:12.372 --> 18:13.460
More like tough--

18:13.573 --> 18:15.696
Not giving a shit anymore,
Eddie.

18:15.809 --> 18:17.297
If you want to--
If you want to tap out

18:17.410 --> 18:19.166
'Cause your life
is shit--

18:19.279 --> 18:20.301
You know what?

18:20.414 --> 18:22.770
It's not your life, it's life.

18:22.883 --> 18:24.372
It's-- Life
is bigger than you,

18:24.485 --> 18:26.174
if you can imagine that.

18:26.287 --> 18:28.877
Life isn't something
that you possess.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.779
It's something
that you take part in

18:30.892 --> 18:32.181
and you witness.

18:32.294 --> 18:34.883
You are--
You are so excited right now

18:34.996 --> 18:37.520
that you get to give
the big speech.

18:37.633 --> 18:41.457
You would love to be
the guy that talks this loser,

18:41.570 --> 18:44.326
who you never think about,
out of suicide

18:44.439 --> 18:46.962
so you could feel
better about yourself.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.131
This is not about you, Louie.

18:49.244 --> 18:51.200
It's just me saying goodbye.

18:51.313 --> 18:53.503
It was nice to know you
when I knew you.

18:53.616 --> 18:55.805
No, you're laying this shit
on me because--

18:55.918 --> 18:58.007
She's not welcome in my house.
How do you not want me to let her in the house?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.176
I don't like her when she's in there.
She's the mother of my kids.

19:00.289 --> 19:01.945
I don't care, she's not the mother of my kids!
Oh, come on, man, this is ridiculous!

19:02.058 --> 19:03.592
Whenever she needs...

19:20.310 --> 19:23.400
Listen, man, I...

19:23.513 --> 19:26.670
I haven't seen you in 20 years.

19:26.783 --> 19:29.718
And you're right,
I don't think much about you.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.356
I hope you don't...
kill yourself.

19:37.392 --> 19:38.959
I really do.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.421
But I gotta go home.
All right.

19:45.534 --> 19:47.456
I gotta pick up my kids
in the morning.

19:47.569 --> 19:49.036
Okay, man.

19:56.677 --> 19:57.999
All right, man.

19:58.112 --> 19:59.913
I'm gonna take the subway, okay?
All right.

20:02.383 --> 20:04.506
Thanks, buddy.
Good luck in Maine, okay?

20:04.619 --> 20:06.053
Thanks.

20:55.952 --> 21:01.734
A little too proud of yourself for just
not being a piece of shit.

21:02.318 --> 21:05.478
If you see somebody in a store
who's got a thing...

21:05.591 --> 21:06.897
Whatever it is...

21:07.598 --> 21:10.915
It's not supposed to be any negative
version of anything of anybody.

21:11.028 --> 21:13.898
They had a creative amount of limbs.

21:16.144 --> 21:19.184
And you saw them and you
just scanned the room.

21:19.967 --> 21:22.476
You didn't go... booh!
You just kept going...

21:22.928 --> 21:25.014
You just kept...
That's them, and you just went,

21:24.709 --> 21:25.997
You just kept that ***

21:25.997 --> 21:28.757
You didn't go...
You just kept going.

21:30.056 --> 21:33.316
And then you are like excited,
like, ohh, I am an angel.

21:35.984 --> 21:39.272
There should be a statue
of me in this spot.

21:40.151 --> 21:43.630
Letting that person have the same
just regular day that I had.
