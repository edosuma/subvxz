WEBVTT

00:05.713 --> 00:07.049
Eh?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.928
Mom, a tiara is a backward symbol

00:12.011 --> 00:14.097
of how women are only valued
for their beauty.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.557
And now that I'm wearing one...

00:16.183 --> 00:19.352
I don't care. I look awesome.
And it's super sparkly!

00:19.436 --> 00:21.104
-[shrieks]
-[both laugh]

00:21.854 --> 00:23.065
I'm so glad you like it.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.943
'Cause tomorrow's your  quinces,
and your only job is to be happy.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.571
-[giggles]
-Listen up, grunts.

00:30.863 --> 00:33.700
In 55 minutes,
we have the final venue walkthrough.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.454
And you hear that rumble?
Oh, yeah.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.915
That's the sound
of 183 Cubans arriving in Los Angeles.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.670
Seventeen of whom
will be staying in this room.

00:45.753 --> 00:48.131
Er... fire code-wise,
I don't think that's gonna--

00:48.214 --> 00:49.049
Shut it!

00:51.718 --> 00:56.306
I am going on no sleep
and five Cuban coffees.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.351
Do you really want to mess
with me right now?

01:01.394 --> 01:02.770
[softly] No, ma'am.

01:04.356 --> 01:07.067
As head of transpo you have one job.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.861
Get the Cubans to and from the airport.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.571
I hope you brushed up on your Spanish.

01:11.654 --> 01:12.739
Claro que sí.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.948
[speaking Spanish]

01:15.241 --> 01:16.576
Claro que sí.

01:18.495 --> 01:22.749
I want it on the record that your tone
is very annoying.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.210
[scoffs] [in English] Okay.
You're kidding me, right?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.463
The day of my  quinces,
you screamed at  Tía  Mirtha

01:28.546 --> 01:30.673
because she brought hot pink balloons
instead of fuchsia.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.550
Fuchsia is a royal color!

01:33.635 --> 01:36.138
Hot pink is what a girl wears
on a spring break,

01:36.221 --> 01:38.306
before flashing her  tetas.

01:38.806 --> 01:41.976
[arguing in Spanish]

01:42.060 --> 01:44.562
[both arguing in Spanish]

01:44.646 --> 01:46.940
[speaking Spanish]

01:47.023 --> 01:49.192
Oye,  why aren't you filming this?

01:49.901 --> 01:54.156
You want me to film you two arguing?
I have hours of that. In here.

01:54.864 --> 01:58.034
Elena, your dress is in the closet.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.703
If you should happen to find
a straightjacket there,

02:00.787 --> 02:03.080
please bring it out here,
for your crazy  mami.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.627
First arrivals are in 42 minutes.

02:07.710 --> 02:12.006
And Schneider, I'm sorry that I'm
in hyper-focused bitch mode, but really...

02:12.507 --> 02:13.841
[sighs] thank you for doing this.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.136
Pen, are you kidding me?
You guys are like family.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.554
Tick tock.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.393
I just...

02:23.476 --> 02:25.437
Mami,  I really need
this all to go perfectly.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.397
Elena's been through so much this year.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.984
I mean, the divorce, she came out to us,
her creepy little goth friend moved away.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.820
Ah,  pobrecita  Carmen.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.864
So whatever Elena wants for her  quinces,
she gets.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.991
Tres leches cake? I got you.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.619
All white flowers? I got you.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.413
Tables named after famous feminists?

02:43.496 --> 02:46.374
I had to do a lot of Googling,
but, Elena, I got you.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.919
And look at this seating chart. What!

02:50.753 --> 02:53.381
I mean, I'm a humble woman,
but that's art there.

02:53.881 --> 02:55.592
And that reminds me,

02:55.675 --> 02:58.553
Victor's cousin Macho is bringing
his girlfriend.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.012
Mami,  we said no girlfriends.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.308
Apparently, they are in love.

03:05.768 --> 03:06.853
Okay.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.403
Fine, I got it.

03:15.486 --> 03:19.782
We're gonna move you
to the Frida Kahlo table,

03:20.283 --> 03:24.037
and the Oprah Winfrey table will go
from eight seats to ten.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.748
You get a seat! You get a seat!

03:26.831 --> 03:29.667
Everybody gets a seat!

03:33.255 --> 03:34.506
So... [clears throat]

03:35.131 --> 03:38.218
how are you feeling about... Victor?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.636
Fine. [chuckles softly]

03:39.719 --> 03:41.471
Yeah, fine,
and I have you to thank for it.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.807
Between growing up Cuban and Catholic,
I've got everything pushed way down.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.393
You're welcome,  mija.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.813
Anyway, Victor knows
I don't want to see him until the  quinces.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.524
And the kids still think
he's staying at Schneider's

03:52.607 --> 03:53.858
because your bed hurt his back.

03:53.941 --> 03:55.192
Bueno. Yo--

03:55.276 --> 03:59.697
[both exclaiming in Spanish]

04:00.407 --> 04:01.574
[Elena shrieks]

04:01.658 --> 04:02.992
Ooh.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.870
[laughing]

04:06.788 --> 04:09.541
Thank you so much,  Abuelita.
It's beautiful.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.708
What's wrong with it?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.211
Nothing. I'm happy, I'm smiling.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.089
Exactly. You are not sobbing with joy.
I have failed you.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.343
I have failed my family.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.012
I have failed Cuba.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.473
[theme song playing]

05:14.356 --> 05:16.232
Everything is all set for tomorrow.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.652
And I just want to say,
you have chosen the perfect ballroom.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.197
Penelope.
This place is an acoustical nightmare.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.200
Doc, what are you doing here?

05:26.284 --> 05:28.536
Practicing my toast, duh.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.750
Oh. The toast is kinda my thing.
So maybe you don't speak.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.046
Don't worry, Leslie.

05:38.129 --> 05:43.426
Elena's  quinces  is going to be
a very special day for everyone.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.970
[shudders]

05:47.805 --> 05:48.806
No. Don't film that.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.433
Excuse me.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.852
Where is the dance floor?

05:52.935 --> 05:55.354
Um, you're standing on it.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.440
Are you kidding me?

05:58.941 --> 06:04.321
I have relatives who escaped from Cuba
on a raft bigger than this.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.616
[speaks Spanish]

06:06.699 --> 06:09.494
Hey. Hey, Lucy. I'm sorry about her.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.830
Let me translate.
She would like a larger dance floor.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.206
Give the lady a bigger floor.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.167
-Papi.
-Hey.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.087
-[Elena chuckles]
-Hey. Hi.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.632
Hi. You're here.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.468
Yeah. I asked  Papi  to come so we could
practice our father-daughter dance.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.804
-Oh.
-Yeah, we have to do something really good

06:27.887 --> 06:31.057
to distract the audience
because the song is super cheesy.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.018
-[Spanish song playing over cell phone]
-Ay,  Julio.

06:36.228 --> 06:38.230
Let them do that.
You help me sneak in the booze

06:38.314 --> 06:39.691
we bought at Costco. Come on.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.985
[song continues playing]

06:44.946 --> 06:45.988
Don't worry.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.825
I found a more modern version
for us to dance to.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.410
Oh, I kinda like this one.

06:51.243 --> 06:52.244
Me, too.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.498
It's about, uh,
how you look away for a second

06:55.582 --> 06:57.500
and you turn back and...

06:58.167 --> 07:00.670
-your little girl's all grown up.
-[both chuckle]

07:02.464 --> 07:03.631
It's actually getting to me.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.764
[sighs]  Papi,  I want to
tell you something.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.891
That I'm the greatest dancer
you've ever seen?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.017
[whispers] I know.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.855
That, and...

07:20.773 --> 07:21.774
I have grown up.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.778
And I've learned a lot about myself
since you've been gone.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.447
And I've changed.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.658
-Well, not changed, but, um...
-Mmm-hmm.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.912
I'm gay.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.833
[chuckles]

07:38.916 --> 07:40.835
Yeah, and you're pregnant, too, right?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.044
[chuckling]

07:42.128 --> 07:44.171
Let's do all the shockers.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.923
[stammers] No.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.217
Papi,  I'm... I'm serious.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.426
I came out while you were gone

07:49.510 --> 07:51.679
and I was just waiting
for the right time to tell you.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.851
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

07:57.644 --> 07:58.645
[inhales deeply]

07:58.728 --> 08:00.980
Okay, so this wasn't the right time.
Just don't be mad.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.733
No, I'm not mad. You're just confused.
I mean, you're 15.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.317
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.781
-[song stops]
-What's going on?

08:11.908 --> 08:12.825
I told him.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.993
Did you know about this?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.329
Yeah. Just give us a sec.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.920
Are you indulging whatever this is?

08:24.003 --> 08:26.047
Uh, you mean supporting our daughter?
Yeah, I am.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.550
No. She's not...
She's not that way, okay?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.426
I've been gone a year.
What the hell's been going on here?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.055
Wow. [scoffs] Okay.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.892
Look, I didn't know she was
gonna tell you, but now that she did,

08:37.975 --> 08:39.644
you're gonna have to figure out
a way to be okay with it.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.022
No, I don't have to be okay with anything.
She's mixed up, and you're her mother.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.607
You aren't even trying
to talk some sense into her?

08:44.691 --> 08:45.692
That's not how this works.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.778
Oh, so we're all just supposed
to pretend like this is cool?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.655
Because it's not. All right?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.615
It's not.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.286
It's my fault.
I kind of ambushed him and it's...

08:58.037 --> 08:59.831
You didn't do anything wrong, baby.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.250
Kinda worried he's not gonna come.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.003
What? No.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.380
No, he just needs a minute.
He's not good with change.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.884
You should have seen him the first time
he saw me without makeup. Whoa!

09:11.968 --> 09:13.510
"Who are you right now?

09:14.762 --> 09:16.973
-Why don't you have eyebrows?"
-[chuckles]

09:21.310 --> 09:24.480
[speaking Spanish]

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
Gracias.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.775
[speaks Spanish]

09:28.610 --> 09:31.070
Don't freestyle. Stick with the picture.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.072
Follow Olguitita's example.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.743
[gasps] And what the hell
is a carnation doing in here?

09:38.077 --> 09:40.287
Mami,  a word?

09:41.497 --> 09:43.290
When was the last time you slept?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.209
Two days ago. Yeah, but don't worry.

09:45.292 --> 09:47.754
I take little power naps
when I pee. [panting]

09:48.838 --> 09:49.839
Maybe you should lie down.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.132
[mockingly] "Maybe you should lie down."

09:51.215 --> 09:55.011
-What's happening?
-[sighs] Sorry. There's just a lot to do.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.179
And people say they want to help
and friggin' Tina's over there

09:57.263 --> 09:58.264
doing her own thing,
like she always does.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.891
Keep your eye on her.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.017
[Alex sighs]

10:01.809 --> 10:03.185
Hey, guys, what's taking so long?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.311
Oh, hi, Carmen.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.480
Hi, Ms. Alvarez.

10:06.563 --> 10:09.191
Uh... sorry you can't come to the  quinces,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.193
but glad you could make it
to the final fitting.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.821
Elena wanted me to weigh in on her dress.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.156
It's gorgeous.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.366
La Diabla  lies.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.829
I have tried everything.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.999
I have taken away the frills,
I have put on the frills,

10:25.082 --> 10:27.752
I have made it longer,
I have made it shorter.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.379
But she is being impossible.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.924
I told you I love every version of it

10:33.007 --> 10:34.091
See what I mean?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.304
Ay, Mami,  we don't have time for this.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.389
If the dress were truly perfect,

10:40.473 --> 10:43.768
she would be so overcome with emotion,
her eyes would fill with tears.

10:45.561 --> 10:49.315
Maybe what you're picking up on,
is that...

10:50.316 --> 10:52.819
I'm not really comfortable
wearing a dress.

10:52.902 --> 10:57.281
Of course, you are not comfortable.
It's called being a woman.

10:57.949 --> 11:02.203
I am in agony all of the time,
but I look amazing.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.372
Not sure this is the lesson
I want to be teaching,

11:05.456 --> 11:08.375
but I so want to check this box. [sighs]

11:08.459 --> 11:13.047
All I'm saying is that I'm really
figuring out what I am comfortable in.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.716
Last week, I went to a thrift store

11:14.799 --> 11:19.011
and I got some jackets,
some ties, a fedora, a pinstripe suit.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.263
What? You want to look like Al Capone?

11:22.598 --> 11:23.808
Ooh, what about this?

11:23.891 --> 11:27.228
What about, instead of heels...
I wear my Doc Martens?

11:27.311 --> 11:29.646
I mean, all everybody else
would see is the dress,

11:29.731 --> 11:33.234
but underneath there'd be one thing
that's a little more me.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.113
I love that.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.241
Keeping the dress, wearing the Docs.
No more changes.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.325
[Elena chuckles]

11:41.408 --> 11:42.785
You got it, okay!

11:42.869 --> 11:44.245
You're killing me.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.208
Tina, baby's breath?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.544
Stop sneaking in unapproved flowers.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.964
That's my boy.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.550
All right,
here's your last three Alvarezes.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.802
De nada.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.346
Can an  hombre
get a  pastelito  up in this  boca?

12:04.598 --> 12:05.767
I learned more words.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.018
[chuckles]

12:07.101 --> 12:09.896
-Hola. ¿Cómo está?
- Hola.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.481
-Ay, mira el niño tan lindo.
-Gracias.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.735
[both speaking Spanish]

12:15.818 --> 12:20.531
[continues speaking Spanish]

12:20.614 --> 12:22.867
[continues speaking Spanish]

12:22.950 --> 12:24.368
[in English]
I don't know these people.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.624
-What?
-Yeah.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.961
You picked up the wrong Alvarezes.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.838
Did you not look at the photos I gave you?

12:35.921 --> 12:37.006
I did.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.259
But I don't want to be racist,
so let's say I didn't.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.721
All right. Back to  el  Range Rover.

12:44.806 --> 12:48.225
But first we will stop at El Pollo Loco
on La Cienega Boulevard.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.479
I'm running out of words.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.191
Hey, Pen?

12:55.274 --> 12:56.483
-[whispers] Come here.
-Uh-huh?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.820
Just so you know,
Victor's still upstairs in my apartment.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.737
Yeah, thanks again for taking him in.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.282
-Actually, I think he's leaving.
-What?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.034
He was packing up all his stuff
while he was telling me

13:05.117 --> 13:08.830
about Elena's crazy phase
and how everyone's coddling her.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.665
I didn't want to kill the bro vibe
we got going on, so I said,

13:11.748 --> 13:13.835
"I know, right, bro?"
But what I was really thinking was,

13:13.918 --> 13:17.463
"Hell no, bro. That's a no-go."
So... you know.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.224
Hey there.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.725
What's up, Lupe?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.230
I just wanted to make sure
everything was cool.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.693
You're not gonna do something stupid
like not come to the  quinces  tomorrow?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.783
"Yeah, cool, Lupe. I'll be there."
"Oh, thanks, Victor."

13:49.203 --> 13:54.083
Look, I know this is all hitting you fast.
I... was really thrown at first, too.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.292
This isn't who she is, Lupe.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.296
It's not. It's a phase. It's what kids do.
It's, like, cool now to be gay.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.547
Oh, yeah. That's it.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.009
She wants a piece
of that sweet bullying and persecution

14:03.092 --> 14:05.052
because being a teenager's
not hard enough.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.553
You know what? I'm not joking.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.057
And I'm not here to fight with you.
Because this is not about us right now.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.476
This is about your daughter.
And I know you love her.

14:12.559 --> 14:15.312
And you know how much it means to Elena
for you to be at her  quinces.

14:24.821 --> 14:25.948
Does the whole family know?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.200
No.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.826
[door closes]

14:30.411 --> 14:31.913
She's only told a few people.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.999
All right. Well, that's good.
Don't tell anyone else.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.542
-I'm not gonna tell anyone else.
-Good.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.710
Because it's not up to me.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.712
Or you.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.508
It's up to Elena to decide
who she tells and when.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.845
But the one thing you do get to decide

14:48.930 --> 14:50.847
is whether you're gonna be there
for your daughter.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.487
¿Un pastelito?

15:07.281 --> 15:09.074
¿Un pastelito?

15:10.951 --> 15:14.288
Penelope,  hola. ¿Un pastelito?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.916
Doc, I feel like I keep asking you this,
but what are you doing here?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.542
I'm not sure.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.130
I thought I would see everyone
at the  quinces  tomorrow but, uh...

15:24.090 --> 15:26.717
your mom told me to come over tonight.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.802
[gags] Don't do that.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.932
-Mom, don't freak out.
-What happened?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.100
It's gonna be fine.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.727
But  Tía  Mimi just got a call,
and you know the Fajardos?

15:36.810 --> 15:39.772
Rosita, Diana, Marta, Cristina,
Juanito and Baby Juanito?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.234
Can't come because of a baptism
on Rosita's mother's side?

15:43.817 --> 15:44.693
They're coming.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.320
Oh, come on!

15:48.822 --> 15:50.366
I should have known better.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.203
The Fajardos are OG Cubans.
They run on Caribbean time.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.622
Cristina was pregnant with Baby Juanito
for 11 months,

15:56.705 --> 15:58.624
and she still thinks he was premature.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.671
I don't know
if we can fit in any more tables.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.009
We are not adding another table.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.385
I can make this work.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.927
[gasps]

16:14.598 --> 16:16.267
I don't feel safe.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.193
[gasps]

16:41.041 --> 16:42.668
[Penelope screams]

16:48.924 --> 16:50.259
Gracias, estoy bien.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.389
Dr. Berkowitz,
would you mind helping me pick this up?

16:55.472 --> 16:58.434
Oh, absolutely.
It would be a pleasure. [sighs]

16:58.517 --> 17:00.436
I feel like we dodged a bullet there.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.313
Don't drag me down with you, buddy.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.151
Oh, uh, Leslie.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.154
Come into my room, please.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.788
Oh, I can't deal with this right now.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.956
No!

17:25.877 --> 17:28.089
There's no way
you're gonna be able to fix this in time.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.258
Oh, I'm about to go  A Beautiful
freaking  Mind  up in this bitch.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.221
I'm kinda scared of you right now,
so I'm gonna leave.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.349
Yeah, it's a Jekyll-Hyde situation,
so you should run.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.727
[sighs]

17:44.063 --> 17:46.315
[breathes deeply]

17:59.495 --> 18:01.205
[snoring]

18:12.799 --> 18:15.219
[gasps] The Rosa Parks table should not be
in the back!

18:19.973 --> 18:22.726
Where am I? Who put a blanket on me?

18:24.728 --> 18:25.896
Who brushed my teeth?

18:27.939 --> 18:29.816
[gasps] 10:03?
Oh, my God! Is it the morning?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.235
Oh, my God!

18:33.987 --> 18:34.988
[panting]

18:37.491 --> 18:38.367
What?

18:40.369 --> 18:41.620
Did I die?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.502
Is this heaven?

18:50.086 --> 18:53.340
-[knocking on door]
-Open up, it's Schneider.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.342
[groaning] Oh, God, it's hell.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.429
[grunts and pants]

19:04.852 --> 19:07.938
I got one last pickup. You.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.357
What is going on?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.903
The Cubans are missing,
my seating chart is gone

19:14.986 --> 19:18.114
and I'm kind of attracted to you?
Nothing makes sense.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.743
Chill, girl.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.662
Oh, that helps when you talk.
Thank you.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.126
I am here to take you
to your daughter's  quinces.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.963
So, get in that bedroom
and put on all your clothes.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.966
Whoa, I've never said that
to a woman before.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.678
Don't mess with me,
weirdly sexy Schneider.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.973
How did this happen? Who's in charge?

19:43.056 --> 19:45.016
It's handled, boo.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.518
Nice work, Jay.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.480
Tina, there's no confetti on Frida Kahlo.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.106
Ay, Dios mío.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.821
[sighs] Okay.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.157
Now I'm in heaven.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.452
Immigrants. We get the job done.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.456
I can't believe
you pulled this all together.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.333
Look at the centerpieces!

20:09.416 --> 20:12.711
Ay,  Tina.  Muy bien hecho .

20:12.794 --> 20:14.170
All is forgiven.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.883
Yeah, most is forgiven. Okay.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.511
Have you seen your  papi?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
No. But I'm seeing too much of something.

20:39.905 --> 20:40.947
Hey!

20:41.031 --> 20:45.076
Everything looks amazing.
And your  papi's  here.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.078
[sighs]

20:48.079 --> 20:51.833
Okay, so I have made
a few adjustments to the dress.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.503
Mami,  I already checked that box.
In ink.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.714
[stammers] But it's just a few tweaks.
You won't even notice.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.883
I should not have said anything.

20:59.966 --> 21:01.468
-[Elena sighs]
-Mira.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.732
[sobbing and laughing]

21:17.609 --> 21:18.777
I... [laughs]

21:20.737 --> 21:21.947
[Lydia] Oh!

21:22.823 --> 21:26.910
[gasps] Now, that is the response
I have been waiting for.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.997
Next time, don't make me jump
through the hoops.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.250
Hey, everybody.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.421
Hello?

21:40.591 --> 21:43.302
[shouting] Hey, you guys!

21:45.887 --> 21:47.473
The room is yours.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.851
Thank you,  Mami.

21:51.810 --> 21:52.644
[sighs]

21:53.354 --> 21:55.814
Victor and I would like
to thank you all for coming.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.818
And I'm probably gonna cry,
so deal with it,  mi gente .

22:02.237 --> 22:04.490
August 7, 2001.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.701
The doctor said
Elena was due August 15th,

22:07.784 --> 22:08.869
but you know her,

22:08.952 --> 22:11.747
she ain't lettin' no man tell her
when she gonna get birthed.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.749
[all laughing]

22:13.832 --> 22:17.586
Elena has always been her own girl...

22:18.670 --> 22:20.839
and now she's becoming
her own woman.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.718
When she was in third grade,

22:24.801 --> 22:27.804
she played the cherry tree
in a school play.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.016
And when George Washington
swung his ax,

22:31.099 --> 22:34.436
she hit him back and yelled,
"Trees are people, too!"

22:34.520 --> 22:35.729
[all laughing]

22:37.481 --> 22:38.774
And that's Elena.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.860
Always sticking up for the underdog.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.448
Whether it's a tree, an animal,
a friend...

22:48.950 --> 22:49.826
or me.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.792
She's taught me more about being strong...

23:00.170 --> 23:04.674
selfless and true to yourself
than I could have ever taught her.

23:04.758 --> 23:08.595
Okay, I can't hold it together anymore,
so let's just bring the court out here!

23:08.679 --> 23:10.722
[all cheering]

23:24.820 --> 23:27.197
And now, let's welcome
the girl of the hour--

23:27.280 --> 23:30.451
Oh, I mean, the woman of the hour...

23:30.534 --> 23:35.872
Elena Maria Alvarez Riera
Calderón Leytevidal Inclan.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.291
[upbeat music playing]

23:38.374 --> 23:39.960
[all cheering and whooping]

23:45.173 --> 23:48.134
Thank you.  Gracias.  You're welcome.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.430
Are you ready?

23:51.930 --> 23:53.014
Are you sure?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.934
Carmen! Oh!

23:56.518 --> 23:57.561
What are you doing here?

23:57.644 --> 23:59.104
Schneider flew me out.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.987
[slow song playing]

24:14.828 --> 24:16.580
How do you know all the steps?

24:16.663 --> 24:20.041
Your  abuelita  Skyped me
every day for three months.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.503
She was so mean, she made me cry.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.879
I loved it.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.440
[upbeat music playing]

24:48.153 --> 24:49.738
[speaks Spanish]

24:59.330 --> 25:00.749
[Lydia]  Oye. Mira.

25:07.213 --> 25:09.090
[pop music playing]

25:31.446 --> 25:33.281
[all applaud and cheer]

25:37.786 --> 25:40.538
-Ah! [laughs]
-Wow!

25:40.622 --> 25:43.541
What about the suit, huh?
It was perfect.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.295
And I could never have done it
without Leslie.

25:47.378 --> 25:51.007
-What?
-Well, last night your mother said,

25:51.091 --> 25:54.094
"If you can suture, you can sew."

25:54.177 --> 25:56.387
So, I helped her make Elena's suit.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.809
I was on a deadline.
I needed his nimble fingers.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.519
Oh, such a talent!

26:03.019 --> 26:05.939
It's a shame
you wasted your life as a doctor.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.651
Okay.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.320
So when you went in your room last night,
you guys were...

26:12.403 --> 26:15.782
Sewing. What else did you think we-- Oh!

26:19.035 --> 26:20.787
Qué mala. Qué sucia.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.499
All right, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.459
Please, turn your attention
to the dance floor

26:26.542 --> 26:28.294
for the father-daughter dance.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.880
[applause]

26:34.885 --> 26:36.386
[guitar music playing]

27:16.885 --> 27:18.219
I got you.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.873
I'm okay, you guys.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.835
Thank you both
for making me have a  quinces.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.629
I... have to admit, this is pretty great.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.548
Oh, you are welcome,  mija.

28:37.632 --> 28:38.884
[sniffs]

28:38.967 --> 28:41.594
I never tire of saying...

28:41.677 --> 28:43.889
"I told you so."

28:46.474 --> 28:49.770
Eat it up, 'cause we're not doing
this again until your wedding.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.938
Oh, I'm never getting married, so...

28:52.022 --> 28:54.274
[sing-song] I can't hear you.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.777
The music's too loud!

28:56.860 --> 28:58.361
[salsa music playing]
