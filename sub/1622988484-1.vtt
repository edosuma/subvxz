02:19.087 --> 02:22.324
Uh, two beers, whiskey,
more wine.

02:22.457 --> 02:24.493
Danny, you're not supposed

02:42.376 --> 02:44.646
Bryan already knows.

02:44.779 --> 02:46.014
Good.

02:46.148 --> 02:48.283
I hope it's a long engagement.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.050
Why?

02:50.184 --> 02:51.952
It's gonna be a big adjustment
for him.

02:52.087 --> 02:53.255
It's gonna take
some getting used to.

03:20.749 --> 03:22.451
This is really cool.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.086
Thank you, guys.

03:24.219 --> 03:25.820
You know, most of my friends
have birthdays this year.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.689
You've still
got it even in your old age.

03:27.821 --> 03:29.324
Happy birthday.

03:29.457 --> 03:31.993
From here on out,
you're just gettin' old.

03:32.126 --> 03:33.729
Hey, this, uh,
doesn't have a phone.

03:33.862 --> 03:35.996
Comedy equals tragedy
plus time,

03:36.130 --> 03:38.899
so just give it some time
before your next joke.

03:39.034 --> 03:40.334
A long time.

03:40.469 --> 03:41.870
You know they're
not gonna let you

03:42.004 --> 03:43.537
take that
into the festival, right?

03:43.672 --> 03:44.973
Oh, everyone has one of these.

03:45.106 --> 03:46.574
Everyone? At that price?

03:46.707 --> 03:49.610
We're giving you that
under one condition, you know.

03:49.743 --> 03:51.612
Okay, what?

03:51.747 --> 03:53.015
You take Bryan with you.

03:53.148 --> 03:56.385
Uh, actually, dad,

03:56.517 --> 03:58.819
the whole trip was planned
a long time ago.

03:58.953 --> 04:00.522
What's that got to do
with anything?

04:00.654 --> 04:02.757
Well, we're seeing the band
that we saw on our first date.

04:02.892 --> 04:03.993
Rebecca's goin', isn't she?

04:04.125 --> 04:05.893
Yeah, she was
at the same concert.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.529
She introduced us, so...

04:07.662 --> 04:11.100
Yeah, we have, like, a three
musketeers thing going on.

04:11.232 --> 04:12.301
Not...

04:12.433 --> 04:15.403
four.

04:15.536 --> 04:17.538
Lisa, come on, Lees.

04:17.672 --> 04:19.241
Bryan idolizes you.

04:19.374 --> 04:21.608
There's no reason
you can't include him.

04:21.742 --> 04:23.978
It would be his first concert.

04:24.112 --> 04:26.480
He doesn't even have a ticket.

04:26.614 --> 04:27.816
Yes, he does.

04:27.949 --> 04:29.684
You bought Bryan tickets?

04:29.817 --> 04:32.853
You need to spend time together
before it's too late.

04:32.987 --> 04:34.689
- You're filming him! Stop!
- What?

04:34.823 --> 04:36.691
Jesus Christ!
Oh, shit. I'm sorry!

04:36.824 --> 04:38.860
I don't... I don't know what happened.

05:06.754 --> 05:07.988
Oh, shit, dude!

05:08.122 --> 05:09.791
I just threw an M80
in that bathroom.

05:09.925 --> 05:11.425
What's up, B, my dude?

05:11.559 --> 05:13.327
I just wanna know if you need
somebody to work for you

05:13.461 --> 05:15.229
in an official capacity
or apprentice

05:15.362 --> 05:17.464
because I be pulling pranks
like shit just like you, dude.

05:17.598 --> 05:21.268
So, let me know. I love you,
and I'll do anything.

05:21.403 --> 05:23.672
Please.

05:23.805 --> 05:25.072
Hey. Hey, hold up a second.

05:25.206 --> 05:28.277
Hold on. Hold up.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.145
Can I call you
while you're there?

05:30.278 --> 05:32.045
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

05:32.179 --> 05:33.581
Well, I don't know
if I'm okay with you

05:33.715 --> 05:35.117
going on vacation with him.

05:35.249 --> 05:37.119
He's the one
that's my boyfriend.

05:37.251 --> 05:38.853
Yeah, and not much longer.

05:38.987 --> 05:40.388
You don't know that.

05:40.521 --> 05:43.724
Look, honestly, I am
just excited to get away

05:43.857 --> 05:45.160
and have some time to think.

05:45.292 --> 05:47.997
Yeah, but you're gonna
be with him the whole time.

05:48.129 --> 05:51.499
Shane, you and...
Shane, where are you?

05:51.633 --> 05:53.234
Check it out.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.271
You don't care.

05:55.403 --> 05:57.773
I wouldn't blow smoke into it.

05:57.907 --> 05:59.474
You know, I wish you
would've told me

05:59.607 --> 06:01.376
you were gonna pop the question.
Sorry about that.

06:01.509 --> 06:04.146
I literally now just told mom.
I know, I know.

06:04.278 --> 06:07.081
Things don't always go
as planned.

06:07.215 --> 06:10.886
- Well, I'm happy for you. I really am.
- Thanks.

06:11.018 --> 06:13.153
Everything's gonna go well
for you.

06:13.287 --> 06:14.756
- Not like...
- Dad.

06:14.889 --> 06:17.925
You know you can do everything

06:18.059 --> 06:19.928
in your power
to keep your family safe.

06:23.932 --> 06:26.902
Get the safest car, you live
in the best neighborhood,

06:27.035 --> 06:28.437
and then one day...

06:28.569 --> 06:31.872
Speak of the devil.
Hey, Bryan.

06:32.006 --> 06:34.143
Things can change
on a dime, man.

06:34.275 --> 06:35.677
- Hi, Tracy.
- Hey, Tammy.

06:35.811 --> 06:37.145
- Hi, Shane.
- Hi, Danny.

06:37.278 --> 06:38.679
- Hey, Ty.
- What you guys doin'?

06:38.812 --> 06:40.213
- Just looking for the ice cream man.
- Your camera!

06:40.348 --> 06:43.117
Dad, it's not your fault.

06:43.251 --> 06:45.086
Don't say that.

06:45.220 --> 06:47.655
That's what everybody says.

06:47.788 --> 06:49.423
But we know the truth, right?

06:49.557 --> 06:52.528
I should've been watching.
It's okay.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.362
Just be careful.

07:04.872 --> 07:09.277
Babe, you've been
so amazing with the whole,

07:10.946 --> 07:13.280
you know, situation.

07:13.413 --> 07:17.618
I know it's been distracting,
but our love is...

07:17.751 --> 07:21.189
is... what?

07:21.323 --> 07:24.225
Bigger.
Our love is bigger than that.

07:24.359 --> 07:28.430
And I know it's not easy.

07:28.564 --> 07:32.301
It's not easy for me,
but it'll get better.

07:32.434 --> 07:34.035
I promise.
I mean, you know me.

07:34.169 --> 07:36.871
I'm the same guy
from three years ago.

07:37.004 --> 07:38.307
And we can overcome.

07:38.439 --> 07:42.377
Overcome?
Jesus, that's horrible.

07:42.511 --> 07:44.646
Baby, what're you still
doing up? It's midnight.

07:44.778 --> 07:47.949
Hey, I was just messing
with the camera.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.718
All right, well,
I'm going to bed, okay?

07:49.850 --> 07:52.588
We're leaving at 8:00.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.054
Eight? Why so early?

07:54.189 --> 07:55.956
Mm, starts with "t,"
ends with "raffic."

07:56.090 --> 07:57.626
- You okay with that?
- Yeah, sure.

07:57.759 --> 07:59.026
All right.

08:01.429 --> 08:04.465
We had a-a special night.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.333
And I'll admit it,
we connected,

08:06.468 --> 08:09.938
and I really needed that 'cause
Danny and I haven't been...

08:10.071 --> 08:13.273
Danny and I have our own
separate range of problems.

08:13.408 --> 08:15.477
But he's a really good person.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.347
Maybe too good
and I don't wanna hurt him.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.249
See? You could be free
from all of that.

08:21.383 --> 08:22.684
With me, there's no baggage.

08:22.816 --> 08:24.485
And I don't give a damn
about you know who,

08:24.619 --> 08:26.154
so you'll never have
to worry about him...

08:26.287 --> 08:27.489
Look, I've gotta go.
We'll talk when I get back.

08:27.622 --> 08:29.157
- Can I meet you out there?
- No!

08:29.290 --> 08:31.193
I'm gonna miss you.

08:57.452 --> 08:58.820
Good evening,

08:58.953 --> 09:01.456
Terror Eyes community.

09:01.589 --> 09:03.156
The joys of this moment are...

09:03.290 --> 09:05.794
...many.

09:05.926 --> 09:11.232
First, we have for you
another tantalizing video.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.602
We also got a new camera...
camera.

09:14.736 --> 09:17.606
It's actually kind of the reason
for our visit tonight.

09:17.738 --> 09:19.940
Ours ran out of battery...
battery.

09:20.074 --> 09:21.776
Just take what you want!

09:26.814 --> 09:29.516
All we want is the camera.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.019
Then go.

09:32.721 --> 09:35.557
You don't want me to hurt you?

09:41.862 --> 09:43.464
We're running
out of batteries.

09:43.598 --> 09:45.099
What?

09:45.232 --> 09:46.800
The camera, dude.

09:46.934 --> 09:50.371
Hey, homo.

09:50.505 --> 09:52.574
Hey, homo, I'm talking to you!

09:54.742 --> 09:55.776
I'm not even gay.

09:55.910 --> 09:59.213
Yeah, but you're a homo-ner!

09:59.348 --> 10:02.517
You have
an extra battery... battery?

10:04.886 --> 10:06.788
No.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.367
Yes! Mike!
Grab your big, bad camera.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.535
We got shit to do!

10:21.669 --> 10:24.372
And don't forget batteries
this time, man!

10:27.107 --> 10:29.276
- Hey...
- Hey!

10:29.410 --> 10:30.811
You ready to party
in the desert?

10:30.945 --> 10:33.214
Oh, yes.
Check it out.

10:33.348 --> 10:35.817
See, I heard you got a new toy!

10:35.949 --> 10:37.384
So did I.

10:37.519 --> 10:39.654
Uh, well, if the car dies,
we're good on batteries.

10:39.788 --> 10:41.423
Remember the little ones
we used to use?

10:41.555 --> 10:42.689
That's like a double-double.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.492
Yeah, well,
someone spoiled me.

10:44.626 --> 10:45.793
All right, Rebecca,
what are you wearing

10:45.926 --> 10:47.761
on the first day
of this adventure?

10:47.896 --> 10:51.266
My fuzzy jacket,
something to swim in.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.434
- Oh, boy.
- And your favorite bra.

10:53.568 --> 10:55.937
- Oh, my God, Rebecca.
- Oh, come on.

10:56.070 --> 10:57.904
Are you still gonna ask her?

10:58.039 --> 11:00.175
Shh!

11:00.308 --> 11:01.410
Yeah.

11:01.543 --> 11:03.011
Are you nervous?

11:03.144 --> 11:04.545
What do you think?

11:04.679 --> 11:07.214
Oh, guess it makes me
a little sad.

11:07.348 --> 11:09.818
Why?
Hey, girl!

11:09.950 --> 11:11.319
Hey, Lees!

11:11.453 --> 11:12.953
So, he already told you
that he's bringing his

11:13.087 --> 11:14.455
little friend with us.

11:14.588 --> 11:16.089
Okay, let's go!

11:16.223 --> 11:17.792
Hey, let's go!

11:21.328 --> 11:22.863
Hello?

11:22.997 --> 11:24.932
You're with Rebecca, right?
No, thank you.

11:25.065 --> 11:26.767
Just...
No, thank you. Bye.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.237
I have to pee.
I'll be right back.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.172
Every time. I swear.

11:31.305 --> 11:33.007
She's gonna make us
stop so much. Watch.

11:33.141 --> 11:35.876
Hey, put some clothes on
while you're back there.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.646
Whoo-whoo...

11:37.779 --> 11:41.716
Whoo-whoo!

11:41.849 --> 11:44.851

11:44.986 --> 11:48.256

That was awesome guys.
Thanks.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.908
You know your camera's
a little too big to bring

12:07.041 --> 12:08.242
into the festival, right?

12:08.376 --> 12:09.611
So, I guess your new toy's
gonna stay

12:09.743 --> 12:12.012
in the room then, huh, Danny?
Whatever.

12:12.146 --> 12:14.982
It can keep mine company.

12:15.117 --> 12:16.284
- Oh, what an asshole!
- Who?

12:16.416 --> 12:17.718
That guy.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.319
He just threw a pack
of cigarettes out the window.

12:19.453 --> 12:21.923
You serious?
Hey! What the hell?

12:22.055 --> 12:23.824
Danny, stop it!
Someone's gotta tell him.

12:23.958 --> 12:25.493
Yeah, but haven't you
ever heard of road rage?

12:25.626 --> 12:27.561
I mean, people kill over
that kind of stuff.

12:27.694 --> 12:29.296
Sure,
if they're insane.

12:29.429 --> 12:30.698
They are insane.
Guys, I gotta pee.

12:30.832 --> 12:32.701
All right, we are almost there,
okay?

12:32.833 --> 12:36.470
It's 30 more minutes, babe.
I gotta go, too.

12:36.604 --> 12:40.607
All right, all right.
Next exit.

12:40.742 --> 12:43.511
Who's that?

12:43.644 --> 12:44.946
Ah, it's just my mom.

12:45.079 --> 12:47.881
I'll call her once
we're off the road.

12:48.015 --> 12:51.919
Check this!

12:52.053 --> 12:54.622
Do you see that, dude?
I be pullin' pranks, too!

12:54.755 --> 12:56.790
That right there is the banana
in the tail pipe.

12:56.924 --> 12:59.360
No digital mask
'cause you know I'm hardcore!

12:59.493 --> 13:00.761
I trust Terror Eyes.

13:00.896 --> 13:02.631
I know it's a safe,
secure space

13:02.764 --> 13:04.566
for people like you
and me, Bryan.

13:04.699 --> 13:07.102
Hit me up!

13:07.234 --> 13:08.736
I'm so excited to eat.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.572
Babe, you want some chips
or something?

13:10.704 --> 13:13.841
That sounds so good.
Oh, Jesus.

13:13.974 --> 13:17.778
Hello! I said hello.

13:17.913 --> 13:19.514
Hi. Nice car.

13:19.646 --> 13:22.916
Ah, nice camera.
Birthday present?

13:23.050 --> 13:25.185
Yeah, actually. Most of my
friends have birthdays this year.

13:25.319 --> 13:27.854
It's no big deal.

13:27.988 --> 13:32.026
Danny, let's go.
I'm starving. Come on.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.765
That was freaking weird.

13:45.806 --> 13:47.507
Got you some flowers.
Nope. Thank you.

13:47.641 --> 13:49.877
What, are you allergic?
I don't know you.

13:50.011 --> 13:51.512
You're too good for flowers?

13:51.646 --> 13:53.179
Just take 'em!
All right, thanks so much, guy.

13:53.314 --> 13:54.449
God.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.952
Think she likes 'em.

14:02.924 --> 14:05.793
You guys okay?
You guys are so quiet.

14:05.926 --> 14:10.697
Uh, yeah. We're all good.
Yeah. Yeah.

14:11.064 --> 14:13.733
- Oh, man.
- I am stoked for Coachella, guys!

14:13.867 --> 14:16.069
Happy to finally be here!

14:16.203 --> 14:18.138
The bands, the music...

14:18.271 --> 14:20.373
Yeah!

14:20.507 --> 14:22.243
The weed.
Obviously.

14:22.376 --> 14:24.378
Yeah, you can't forget that.
I bet Rebecca smokes more than everybody.

14:24.511 --> 14:26.280
I do not.
Well, I don't know.

14:26.414 --> 14:28.583
Lisa, you might be able...
you might be able to take her.

14:28.717 --> 14:30.617
Yeah.
Check out the pool!

14:30.751 --> 14:32.120
- Wow!
- Whoo-hoo!

14:32.252 --> 14:34.155
That's awesome!

14:34.289 --> 14:35.423
Lisa, gotta take a video.

14:35.556 --> 14:37.558
So, we are checking in!

14:37.692 --> 14:39.227
- Hi!
- Palm Springs, baby!

14:39.359 --> 14:41.928
What, what! On our way.
Oh, that's pretty.

14:42.063 --> 14:43.799
Oh, I like that
background better.

14:43.931 --> 14:45.566
Can we do another one?
You want another one?

14:45.699 --> 14:47.434
Yes! All right. We're gonna do
this every 30 seconds, aren't we?

14:47.568 --> 14:48.670
Hi guys!
It's the same day!

14:48.803 --> 14:50.638
Ah, look at it!
It's so nice.

14:50.771 --> 14:52.607
All right, let's get to the room.
I gotta pee. I'm documenting you guys

14:52.741 --> 14:54.241
- documenting yourself for social media.
- Yeah. Right?

14:54.375 --> 14:55.744
Lisa, where are we going?

14:55.876 --> 14:58.512
- 204?
- Yeah, that was it.

14:58.646 --> 15:00.480
Ooh, something smells
like weed, doesn't it?

15:00.615 --> 15:02.751
And here we are!

15:02.883 --> 15:04.584
Arriving at the extravagant,
king-sized,

15:04.718 --> 15:07.121
Palm Springs luxury suite.

15:07.255 --> 15:11.259
Mini-fridge, cable TV...

15:11.391 --> 15:13.895
A real swimming pool?

15:14.027 --> 15:15.328
Wow, Danny.

15:15.463 --> 15:16.664
So, what are we doing tonight?

15:16.796 --> 15:18.965
Besides staying in
and watching porn?

15:19.099 --> 15:20.400
All of the porn, yes.

15:20.534 --> 15:22.602
Um, I found a few
bars online,

15:22.737 --> 15:24.038
but I don't know
what you guys feel like.

15:24.170 --> 15:26.974
What do you wanna do?
I found a karaoke place.

15:27.107 --> 15:29.376
Really?
The thanks for coming club.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.745
Ooh, I don't know about that.

15:30.877 --> 15:32.146
Karaoke no jokey!

15:32.279 --> 15:33.481
- We'll see!
- Ooh!

15:33.613 --> 15:35.349
Gonna go change?

15:35.482 --> 15:37.718
Yeah, I'm gonna put my suit on.

15:37.852 --> 15:40.387
I wonder how late
the pool stays open till.

15:40.521 --> 15:43.091
- Not a clue.
- You still skinny dip?

15:43.223 --> 15:44.925
Lees and I go
every Tuesday at 11.

15:45.059 --> 15:47.261
Oh, come on. You know
she's gonna crash early.

15:47.395 --> 15:49.030
Keep me company.

15:49.163 --> 15:52.734
Restless neighbor.

15:52.867 --> 15:55.303
Really?

15:55.435 --> 15:56.838
Come on.

15:56.972 --> 15:59.473
Can you please stop
doing that? Jesus.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.011
So, yeah. You know, my pranks
don't really...

16:04.145 --> 16:06.515
don't really
get shit for views.

16:14.421 --> 16:16.589
I'm no Bryan. I never will be.

16:16.723 --> 16:17.958
But I'm his biggest fan.

16:18.093 --> 16:19.794
It's like, we're like brothers,
you know?

16:19.926 --> 16:22.763
I'm not just gonna sit here
and let life pass me by.

16:22.896 --> 16:24.464
I got plans, okay?

16:24.598 --> 16:27.434
I'm gonna create my own channel
on Terror Eyes, call it, like,

16:27.568 --> 16:28.936
"Talkin' Terror."

16:29.069 --> 16:30.571
Something along the...
I don't...

16:30.704 --> 16:32.206
whatever it's called,
it's gonna be dope,

16:32.339 --> 16:34.541
and I'm gonna bring you
the best of Terror Eyes.

16:34.675 --> 16:38.346
The best of TE!
T-E-T-V!

16:38.478 --> 16:40.547
Oh, shit, dude!

16:40.680 --> 16:44.084
Let's go! Whoo!

16:44.218 --> 16:46.087
- Hey, what's up, girls?
- Hey.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.661
No!

16:58.333 --> 17:01.135
No!

17:01.269 --> 17:04.138
I love your new toy.
It's nice and big.

17:04.271 --> 17:07.540
Oh, dear.

17:07.675 --> 17:10.845
Phelps shaking in
his speedos!

17:14.281 --> 17:17.117
Look what I got.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.053
You can't keep calling me
like this.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.789
Show off.

17:21.922 --> 17:25.093
No, I'm serious. Not here.

17:25.224 --> 17:27.493
He's in the pool.
I gotta go, okay?

17:27.627 --> 17:30.097
Where's the bathroom?
Should I just go in the pool?

17:30.231 --> 17:31.799
Don't you dare.
It's right over there.

17:31.932 --> 17:33.501
All right, I'm getting out.
I'll be back.

17:33.635 --> 17:38.039
Got us some drinks?

17:38.172 --> 17:40.208
Thanks.
You're looking great, girl.

17:40.340 --> 17:44.011
Please.
You're the bombshell here.

17:44.145 --> 17:48.382
So, who keeps calling?
It's getting a little awkward. Really?

17:48.515 --> 17:50.650
Yeah, but don't worry.
Danny hasn't noticed.

17:50.783 --> 17:52.152
It's his brother.

17:52.286 --> 17:54.822
Shane?
Shut the back door.

17:54.954 --> 17:56.189
I know it's messed up.

17:56.322 --> 17:58.425
At least you're keeping it
in the family.

17:58.559 --> 18:00.194
The worst part is I think

18:00.327 --> 18:01.896
Danny wants to take things
to the next level,

18:02.030 --> 18:03.830
and I'm not sure
if I'm ready for that.

18:03.964 --> 18:05.566
Do I tell Danny or not?

18:05.700 --> 18:07.902
Yeah, that's a tough one.
And Shane is all in.

18:08.036 --> 18:09.770
You see that
he keeps calling me.

18:09.904 --> 18:14.041
He won't leave me alone.
I must admit it is...

18:14.175 --> 18:15.175
Tempting?

18:15.309 --> 18:19.012
Look, with Danny,
I get Bryan, too.

18:19.146 --> 18:20.514
And I know that
it's his little brother,

18:20.647 --> 18:25.386
but he follows us everywhere,
and Danny protects him.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.186
It is kind of sweet, though.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.692
I remember Danny defending Bryan
all the time, fighting for him.

18:31.826 --> 18:34.761
Bryan is just always there.

18:34.895 --> 18:36.631
Don't say anything, okay?

18:36.763 --> 18:38.433
- No, of course not.
- Thank you.

18:40.733 --> 18:44.203
- What?
- Nothing. You look nice.

18:44.338 --> 18:46.307
Thanks. All right, I'm ready.
I promise. We can go.

18:46.441 --> 18:47.909
- Oh...
- Oh...

18:48.041 --> 18:50.011
Hottie from the potty.

18:50.144 --> 18:52.279
Stop it, guys.
So beautiful.

18:52.413 --> 18:54.682
You guys ready to rip up
Palm Springs?

18:54.816 --> 18:56.350
I love you guys.
Documenting our departure.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.651
Aw, group hug?

18:57.784 --> 18:59.052
- Group hug.
- Ooh!

18:59.186 --> 19:01.888
Let's go!
Oh, my purse, too.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.800
Danny, you forgot
your camera again.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.233
Honey? Yep, I was...
I was coming to get.

19:14.367 --> 19:18.839
We'll be in the car.

19:18.973 --> 19:21.675
Ugh, freaking knocking.

19:21.809 --> 19:22.976
I'm going over there.

19:29.149 --> 19:32.285
You know, Danny would never
tell me what happened to Bryan.

19:32.419 --> 19:35.955
He just said it was, like,
a car accident.

19:36.089 --> 19:37.692
Just looking for
the ice cream man.

19:37.825 --> 19:40.094
- Your camera!
- Bryan.

19:40.228 --> 19:43.397
Come on, man.
Gonna give it?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.732
You understand all of us
and those girls think

19:45.867 --> 19:47.401
you're a dumbass, right?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.136
So, the boys were playing
in the street on their bikes,

19:49.270 --> 19:50.937
and their dad was supposed
to be watching them,

19:51.071 --> 19:53.406
but he went
to the store for beer.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.041
Your bike.
Dude.

19:55.175 --> 19:59.946
Bring it back, asshole.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.515
A car ran over Bryan

20:01.648 --> 20:03.283
and dragged him
for half a block.

20:03.417 --> 20:05.285
Danny ran after them,
pulled his brother out

20:05.419 --> 20:07.254
and drove him to the hospital
in his mother's car.

20:07.387 --> 20:09.022
He didn't even have
his license yet.

20:09.155 --> 20:10.491
Who hit him?

20:10.625 --> 20:12.425
Hit and run.
Oh, God.

20:12.559 --> 20:16.664
Bryan doesn't remember anything,
but Danny is his hero,

20:16.798 --> 20:18.532
his guardian angel.

20:18.665 --> 20:20.400
Permanently.

20:20.534 --> 20:23.002
Sucks.
For everyone.

20:23.136 --> 20:25.239
And don't get me wrong,
I feel so sorry for Bryan.

20:25.371 --> 20:28.007
What happened to him is horrible
and on top of that,

20:28.142 --> 20:30.678
now he's been bullied
for most of his life.

20:30.811 --> 20:33.079
Or people just ignore him.
Like we do.

20:33.213 --> 20:34.514
Yeah, but that's what he wants.

20:34.647 --> 20:35.882
Is it?

20:36.015 --> 20:37.984
Sorry, guys.

20:38.117 --> 20:39.453
Danny, where are you
taking us?

20:39.587 --> 20:41.689
It's karaoke night
at the veteran's bar.

20:41.822 --> 20:44.824
It's supposed to be cool.
All right.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.626
Ooh, I hear music.
I hear music.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.796

I'll be at the bar.
A paying customer.

22:46.413 --> 22:49.316
Lisa, you good? Oh, come on.
I live in Los Angeles.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.619
Bec, do you wanna
do a duet with me maybe?

22:51.751 --> 22:53.120
Let's do it.

22:53.253 --> 22:54.856
I think they've had enough
of just me up here.

22:54.989 --> 22:58.792
Oh, hold this.
It's gonna be a surprise.

22:58.925 --> 23:00.126
Just trust me.
I trust you.

23:00.261 --> 23:03.129
Okay.
What's your name?

23:03.262 --> 23:04.430
What's your name?

23:04.565 --> 23:06.167
Um, it's get the fuck
out of my face.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.569
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for Lisa and Rebecca

23:09.703 --> 23:11.705
train-wreck-a.

23:11.838 --> 23:13.973
- Lisa!
- I knew you'd love it!

23:14.107 --> 23:15.443
Okay, you want the pink
or the green?

23:15.576 --> 23:17.310
- I'll take the pink?
- Green.

23:17.444 --> 23:19.146
Okay.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.216
♪ They wonder where
you're at ♪

23:23.349 --> 23:27.320
♪ They wonder who you see ♪

23:27.454 --> 23:31.391
♪ The mother waits all day ♪

23:31.524 --> 23:34.828
♪ No, no, do they wonder ♪

23:34.962 --> 23:36.763
♪ What became of me the way ♪

23:36.896 --> 23:40.701
- Oh, stop!
- I have a boyfriend.

23:40.834 --> 23:44.037
Where?
He's right there.

23:44.171 --> 23:46.073
Let's just go.

23:46.205 --> 23:47.407
- Say something.
- No.

23:47.540 --> 23:49.242
Let's go.
Say something to me.

23:49.376 --> 23:50.978
Don't! Don't say something.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

23:51.111 --> 23:52.545
Don't forget your camera.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.282
Don't say anything.
Did he touch you?

23:54.415 --> 23:55.982
No, no. I'm totally fine.

23:56.116 --> 23:59.552
Let's just go, okay?
Bye, kids!

23:59.686 --> 24:04.157
Come on.

24:12.132 --> 24:14.868
Oh, where is it?
Oh, my God.

24:15.001 --> 24:16.569
Relax, Lisa.
No, look!

24:16.703 --> 24:19.674
You
have got to be kidding me.

24:19.807 --> 24:24.312
Who are these guys?
How did they find us here?

24:24.444 --> 24:26.946
Record this.
My phone keeps dying.

24:27.079 --> 24:30.384
Here.

24:30.517 --> 24:31.786
Lisa.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.954
I just gotta tell you, I think
you are so goddamn beautiful.

24:35.088 --> 24:38.459
Don't touch me.
Back off, man.

24:38.592 --> 24:39.825
Or what?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.528
She obviously doesn't want
anything to do with you.

24:41.662 --> 24:43.396
How do you know?
No, guy, he's right.

24:43.530 --> 24:45.933
I really think that the both
of you need to just go away.

24:46.066 --> 24:49.036
I think she wants a real man...

24:49.168 --> 24:50.537
deep inside.
Oh, my God.

24:50.671 --> 24:53.808
Just leave us alone, all right?
You're on camera.

24:53.941 --> 24:56.343
Anything you do is evidence.
So?

24:56.475 --> 24:58.445
You touch any of us,
you're basically screwed.

24:58.578 --> 25:00.447
Oh, you touch any of us,

25:00.580 --> 25:02.248
you're basically screwed.
She's not into you!

25:02.383 --> 25:03.617
Danny, don't do it.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.219
Save it for a girl
who's more your type.

25:05.351 --> 25:07.287
You know, roofied.

25:10.924 --> 25:12.460
Oh, my God.

25:12.592 --> 25:15.128
Not here!

25:16.731 --> 25:18.531
Look, the guy's got a little
fight in him after all!

25:18.665 --> 25:20.568
- This woman has more balls than you!
- Stay the hell away!

25:22.036 --> 25:24.872
Don't you know people
who get in fights get hurt?

25:25.004 --> 25:26.639
And the people who try to stop
the fights,

25:26.772 --> 25:28.675
they get hurt the worst.
I'm gonna call the police.

25:28.809 --> 25:32.780
Another bit of good advice
you're not listening to.

25:32.913 --> 25:34.882
I know you guys.

25:35.014 --> 25:38.484
Mike, keep her there.

25:38.618 --> 25:40.855
What are you...
what are you doing?

25:40.988 --> 25:45.626
There are no cameras
back here.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.761
I'll grab the security tape.

25:48.896 --> 25:52.132
Danny, that was so awesome!

25:52.265 --> 25:55.268
I mean, the way
you stood up to them.

25:55.402 --> 25:57.571
Wait! Where are you going?

25:57.703 --> 26:00.107
Danny!

26:00.241 --> 26:02.075
Oh, my God.

26:02.209 --> 26:05.179
Oh!

26:05.311 --> 26:07.680
Damn! That was dumb, Danny.

26:07.815 --> 26:09.383
Good crime for Terror Eyes,
though.

26:09.515 --> 26:11.485
And what about that Lisa?
She feisty as hell.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.422
I'm Sammy Psylocybin and you're
watching Terror Eyes TV.

26:15.555 --> 26:17.057
Bringing you the best of TE.

26:17.191 --> 26:19.559
So, swipe up or slide right
to get more of the story,

26:19.693 --> 26:22.762
and don't you forget,
we got eyes on you... you.

26:31.472 --> 26:34.540
- Are you still gonna ask her?
- Shh.

26:34.675 --> 26:37.645
Yeah.
Are you nervous?

26:41.315 --> 26:44.919
Bryan! Ugh, stop it!

26:47.288 --> 26:49.556
- Hey, girl!
- Hey, Lees!

26:49.690 --> 26:51.357
So, he already told you
that he's bringing his

26:51.491 --> 26:52.559
little friend with us.

26:52.693 --> 26:54.228
Yep.
Never look into his camera,

26:54.361 --> 26:56.162
and never, ever show him
yours, okay? Yep.

26:56.297 --> 26:57.831
You see that?

26:57.964 --> 26:59.433
I got access to footage that
you ain't never seen before

26:59.566 --> 27:01.335
because I'm a legit ass hacker.

27:01.469 --> 27:04.538
You better ask somebody,
you know what I'm saying?

27:04.671 --> 27:06.240
Who's that?

27:06.373 --> 27:07.741
Ah, it's just my mom.

27:07.875 --> 27:09.644
I'll call her once
we're off the road.

27:11.846 --> 27:14.615
Bryan, can you stop
filming for once?

27:14.748 --> 27:18.653
Come on, man.
I'd asked you not to film Lisa.

27:21.155 --> 27:23.523
Only Terror Eyes TV brings
you extended clips,

27:23.657 --> 27:26.260
deleted scenes,
new angles, interviews...

27:27.860 --> 27:30.396
Shut up!

27:33.232 --> 27:35.368
Did you just do
what I think you just did?

27:35.501 --> 27:37.236
What the hell?
You know what?

27:37.370 --> 27:39.239
Maybe they deserved it!

27:39.373 --> 27:42.642
- How do you know that they weren't watching?
- I hope they were.

27:42.776 --> 27:44.978
You can't just mess
with people like that, Danny!

27:45.111 --> 27:48.148
- Not here.
- Yeah, well, now they'll learn their lesson.

27:51.385 --> 27:54.253
Why would you do that?
That's really bad.

27:54.387 --> 27:55.888
Are they following us now?

27:56.021 --> 27:57.992
- No, they're not at their car yet.
- Oh, my God.

27:58.125 --> 28:01.795
It is not your job
to teach people a lesson, Danny!

28:19.012 --> 28:21.115
Come on,
you dressed like a ninja or some?

28:21.248 --> 28:24.785
Oh, shit!

28:50.610 --> 28:53.580
I need a drink.
Yep, me, too.

28:53.713 --> 28:55.816
Haven't you guys
had enough already?

28:55.950 --> 28:57.350
It's my card
those are going on.

28:57.483 --> 28:59.285
I'll pay you back.
No, I'm good. Thank you.

28:59.418 --> 29:00.553
Pass me one.

29:00.687 --> 29:03.256
Thank you.

29:03.389 --> 29:05.059
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:10.598 --> 29:12.031
Yo, this is Sammy Psylocybin,

29:12.165 --> 29:14.768
and I got updates and
special guests coming right up.

29:14.901 --> 29:17.971
But first, as you all know,
Bryan is up to something big.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.941
Can't spoil anything, but shit's
about to get real real,

29:21.073 --> 29:22.409
real soon.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.210
Babe, you want some chips
or something?

29:24.345 --> 29:26.180
That sounds so good.
Yeah, all right.

29:26.312 --> 29:28.748
- Jesus.
- Hello.

29:28.883 --> 29:31.017
I said hello.

29:31.151 --> 29:32.953
Most of my friends
have birthdays this year.

29:33.086 --> 29:34.354
No big deal.

29:34.486 --> 29:35.622
Danny, let's go.
I'm starving.

29:35.755 --> 29:39.626
- Come on.
- You Bryan?

29:58.444 --> 30:00.981
I'm going to bed.
Danny, you ready?

30:01.115 --> 30:04.919
Yep.

30:05.051 --> 30:07.788
Danny! What is this?

30:07.921 --> 30:10.690
Your pillow?
Filled with paper?

30:10.823 --> 30:13.093
I told you enough with
the infantile pranks already!

30:13.226 --> 30:14.960
I didn't do it!
Really? You didn't do this?

30:15.095 --> 30:16.363
No, I didn't!

30:16.496 --> 30:19.332
Lisa. Relax.
It's a harmless prank.

30:19.465 --> 30:22.001
Who's that?

30:24.171 --> 30:26.540
Hello?

30:26.674 --> 30:30.578
To this room? No.
Who are they?

30:32.611 --> 30:34.246
They're not with us.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.682
- No.
- Who was it?

30:36.817 --> 30:39.019
Somebody asked for a key
to our room.

30:39.153 --> 30:40.286
No way.

30:40.419 --> 30:41.688
They said he was your husband.

30:41.821 --> 30:44.058
What?
They didn't give it to him.

30:44.191 --> 30:45.659
I certainly hope not.

30:45.792 --> 30:48.427
You guys think
it was those guys?

30:48.561 --> 30:49.963
How would they know
where we were staying?

30:50.097 --> 30:51.565
They could've
followed us back.

30:51.697 --> 30:55.435
They weren't. I was looking.

30:55.569 --> 30:59.005
Who is it?

30:59.139 --> 31:03.576
Hey, what's up, bro?

31:03.710 --> 31:05.511
What do you want?

31:05.645 --> 31:09.449
Uh, I want to talk to Lisa.
Is she there?

31:09.582 --> 31:11.985
No, you don't.
Is she there or not?

31:12.118 --> 31:14.687
- I'm here.
- Danny! Stop it. This is for real.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.456
Let us in!
You brought pepper spray, right?

31:16.589 --> 31:17.756
- Yeah.
- It's all good!

31:17.890 --> 31:19.758
No, it's not all good.
This is my town.

31:19.893 --> 31:21.095
- Hello?
- Calling the police.

31:21.228 --> 31:22.630
Yeah, you just called
our room a minute ago.

31:22.762 --> 31:24.030
Did you tell those guys
where we were?

31:24.165 --> 31:25.499
What'd you say?
Go bother somebody else.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.467
Well, how did they find us?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.835
- You better not call the cops,.
- Please, you have to do something!

31:29.970 --> 31:31.372
Please, just call the police.

31:31.504 --> 31:32.973
Rats be roadkill
around these parts.

31:33.106 --> 31:34.808
Oh, I'm trembling, dude.
Stop provoking him, Danny!

31:34.942 --> 31:38.279
Hey. Lisa. Is that you?
Yo, let me talk to my girl.

31:38.412 --> 31:41.181
Cops are gonna wanna know
why you followed us.

31:41.313 --> 31:42.749
Follow you we did not.

31:42.883 --> 31:44.718
You liar.

31:44.851 --> 31:47.521
- Mike, did we follow him?
- Follow who?

31:47.655 --> 31:52.091
See? Didn't follow. Dick.
I, unlike you, don't lie.

31:52.225 --> 31:54.127
You try to get a key
to our room,

31:54.261 --> 31:56.162
you're banging on the door
at 2 in the morning.

31:56.296 --> 31:57.530
How'd you find our room?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.032
I should've cut you down
when I had the chance

31:59.165 --> 32:01.768
in that bar, city boy.
Oh, you don't know me.

32:01.902 --> 32:03.136
Why would Lisa wanna
talk to you?

32:03.270 --> 32:05.637
You're a deluded moron!
Danny, stop it!

32:05.771 --> 32:07.573
I'm starting to lose
my patience, son.

32:07.707 --> 32:09.408
Son! Oh, no. No, no, no.

32:09.542 --> 32:11.477
To have one of those,
you need a dick that works.

32:11.610 --> 32:13.012
You're a Neanderthal.

32:13.146 --> 32:14.714
Danny, are you actually
enjoying this?

32:14.848 --> 32:17.184
Come on, Joey.
Let's go. Cops are coming.

32:21.087 --> 32:24.357
I think they're going.
Really?

32:24.491 --> 32:27.161
Yeah, I can hear the cops.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.328
Ugh, thank God.

32:29.463 --> 32:31.932
Hurry up, man.

32:32.065 --> 32:33.600
Fuck! Dude!

32:40.440 --> 32:43.009
It was them.

32:43.143 --> 32:44.677
Joey, can't you hear the cops?

32:44.810 --> 32:46.179
You think I give a shit?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.480
Oh, shit.

32:47.614 --> 32:48.749
- What?
- They're coming back.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.017
Oh, God.
Why is this happening to us?

32:51.151 --> 32:54.254
Open the door!

32:54.386 --> 32:57.390
Help! Somebody, help!

32:57.523 --> 32:59.392
You keyed my car!

32:59.527 --> 33:01.629
About 2,000 people'd
like to do that.

33:01.761 --> 33:04.063
I know it was you!
Cops are coming, asshole.

33:04.197 --> 33:05.799
He doesn't
care about the cops.

33:05.932 --> 33:07.867
They'll be inside
before they get here!

33:08.001 --> 33:11.305
Oh, my God.
He's gonna break through the door!

33:11.437 --> 33:14.139
Find a weapon!
Let's just jump out the window!

33:14.273 --> 33:16.577
It's too high!

33:26.086 --> 33:30.891
Really? We're still doing this?

33:31.023 --> 33:32.658
Joey.

33:32.791 --> 33:36.730
Your brother keyed my car, man.
You understand that? Joey, come on.

33:36.864 --> 33:39.199
This is more
than I bargained for, man.

33:39.332 --> 33:41.100
Somebody's gotta pay
for my car.

33:41.234 --> 33:42.969
He'll do it, Joey.
Let's go.

33:43.103 --> 33:45.472
Let's go, Joey.

33:48.741 --> 33:50.175
What's going on?

33:50.309 --> 33:53.312
Shh!

33:56.616 --> 33:58.751
Did they leave?
Yeah.

33:58.886 --> 34:00.287
They're gone.

34:02.155 --> 34:03.589
He'll do it, Joey.

34:03.723 --> 34:06.626
Let's go. Let's go, Joey.

34:11.130 --> 34:14.501
Bryan, open the door!

34:14.635 --> 34:17.168
I'm coming in!

34:17.303 --> 34:18.938
Where is it?

34:24.444 --> 34:26.078
If you tell anyone,
this trip is over.

34:26.213 --> 34:28.281
If the girls see a gun,
they're gonna freak.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.681
I'm taking this.

34:29.815 --> 34:32.150
Bryan.

34:40.359 --> 34:44.297
Upper decker, Dick.
I don't wanna see it again.

34:46.399 --> 34:47.935
The cops are here.

35:01.281 --> 35:03.217
it's your boy,
Sammy Psylocybin,

35:03.350 --> 35:06.153
and I'm here with my boy,
Satanic Bricabrac!

35:06.285 --> 35:07.820
Yo, what's up?
What're we talkin' about?

35:07.955 --> 35:09.890
What is Bryan up to
with this big surprise?

35:10.022 --> 35:11.691
It sounds massive.

35:11.825 --> 35:13.593
This is what he say.
"Get ready.

35:13.727 --> 35:15.228
"'Cause what you seen so far

35:15.361 --> 35:17.562
is just the tip
of the iceberg-cock."

35:17.696 --> 35:19.365
I love the way he talks, man.

35:19.499 --> 35:20.767
He doesn't really talk, though.

35:20.899 --> 35:22.167
I do know that.

35:22.301 --> 35:24.136
How often do you guys,
like, text?

35:24.269 --> 35:26.105
I mean, like, once a month,
but, like,

35:26.238 --> 35:28.640
it's also been
a little bit more lately even.

35:28.774 --> 35:30.843
I feel like that's not
that much.

35:30.977 --> 35:32.745
Yeah, I never said that he was,
like, my best friend.

35:32.879 --> 35:34.647
I just said that, like, we,
you know,

35:34.781 --> 35:36.483
we communicate about stuff.
I mean, I text my grandma more than that.

35:36.617 --> 35:38.785
But right now, this ain't
about your grandma, okay?

35:38.919 --> 35:41.288
So, I'm a take pause
from my boy, here, and address

35:41.421 --> 35:43.723
these elephant nuts
in the room, okay?

35:43.856 --> 35:46.592
We all know that Bryan
has no bigger fan than me.

35:46.725 --> 35:48.127
Okay?

35:48.260 --> 35:51.363
My entire channel pays homage
to his work, to his site,

35:51.497 --> 35:52.932
and to his legacy in general.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.834
And so, it saddens me to know

35:54.968 --> 35:56.603
that he's upset
with some of the shit

35:56.736 --> 35:58.105
- I've been saying.
- Word?

35:58.238 --> 36:00.073
I always was under
the impression that Terror Eyes

36:00.207 --> 36:01.942
was for uncensored disruption,

36:02.075 --> 36:03.777
- which is exactly what we're doin'.
- Yo.

36:03.910 --> 36:06.078
And the fact that
he's all butt-hurt

36:06.211 --> 36:09.615
about my comments about him
and his crush on Lisa,

36:09.749 --> 36:13.153
- I mean, that just makes him a hypocrite, dude.
- Damn!

36:13.285 --> 36:15.287
And, like, I've asked him
to be here hundreds of times

36:15.421 --> 36:16.823
'cause I know that
if he was sittin'

36:16.955 --> 36:18.291
where you're sittin' right now,

36:18.425 --> 36:19.959
that we would understand
each other

36:20.093 --> 36:23.062
and we would be friends,
but he hasn't hit me up yet.

36:23.196 --> 36:25.397
And we're not friends... yet.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.201
Shit, dude.

36:43.383 --> 36:44.317
Goddamn.

36:44.450 --> 36:46.953
What the hell?

36:47.086 --> 36:49.555
We gotta go back, man.
Back where?

36:49.689 --> 36:50.957
They destroyed my car.

36:51.091 --> 36:53.693
Those assholes gotta
get chopped.

36:53.827 --> 36:55.495
You sure?
We did what we had to do.

36:55.629 --> 36:56.863
Did you even see my car?

36:56.997 --> 36:58.397
Plus,
they called the cops, man.

36:58.531 --> 37:01.601
This is war, Mike!
You're either in or you're out.

37:01.734 --> 37:03.069
Yeah, what're we gonna do?

37:03.202 --> 37:04.803
What're we gonna do?
What do you need?

37:04.937 --> 37:07.473
- Like, more drugs to motivate you, bro?
- Yeah, that could help.

37:07.606 --> 37:09.242
All right.

37:09.376 --> 37:10.977
- There's some coke I left on the dashboard from last week.
- Where?

37:11.109 --> 37:12.546
It's right there.
I don't see it. Where?

37:12.678 --> 37:14.013
Get a little closer.
It's right there. Where?

37:14.147 --> 37:15.581
Dude. Uncalled for.

37:15.714 --> 37:17.149
Mike, right now, you're being
part of the problem.

37:17.283 --> 37:19.586
I need you to be part
of the solution.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.922
We need your car.

37:22.756 --> 37:24.790
Let's do this.

37:24.925 --> 37:27.660
What is this?

37:27.794 --> 37:29.696
- Ernie gave it to me.
- This shit?

37:29.828 --> 37:32.198
Yeah, if you hate it so much,
why don't we use your car?

37:32.332 --> 37:34.500
Wise up, man.
They know my car.

37:34.633 --> 37:37.236
Then it's a perfect disguise.
It's conspicuous.

37:37.370 --> 37:39.406
Inconspicuous, dumbass!

37:39.539 --> 37:41.073
That's what I said.

37:41.207 --> 37:45.110
You said, "It's conspicuous."

37:45.245 --> 37:47.848
That's exactly what I said.

37:47.981 --> 37:51.218
Ugh, just open
the goddamn door, man!

38:45.705 --> 38:46.873
Bryan, hey.

38:47.006 --> 38:48.274
It's all good.
You can come, okay?

38:48.408 --> 38:52.011
You just... you just
gotta be cool, you know?

38:52.144 --> 38:54.313
No pranks.

38:54.446 --> 38:56.515
Obviously, you can't come
to any of the bars,

38:56.649 --> 38:59.152
so you'll just have
to hang out at the hotel.

38:59.285 --> 39:03.723
And I don't want you
obsessively filming Lisa.

39:04.923 --> 39:09.095
Oh, my goodness.
Bryan, you're down there, buddy.

39:09.229 --> 39:11.932
Finally!

39:12.064 --> 39:13.899
Looks like you guys
are having a great trip.

39:14.033 --> 39:15.401
You're probably asleep by now,

39:15.535 --> 39:17.703
but I can't tell you
how proud I am, Danny.

39:17.838 --> 39:20.140
Bryan's so blessed
to have you as a brother.

39:20.272 --> 39:25.044
I mean, his father is useless,
negligent,

39:25.178 --> 39:26.880
and Shane is a douche.

39:27.013 --> 39:28.348
But you're always such an angel.

39:28.481 --> 39:30.316
He can't go to military school.

39:30.450 --> 39:33.352
He could live with you
and Lisa. It'll be perfect.

39:33.486 --> 39:36.556
Bryan just wants to be
with you and her.

39:36.689 --> 39:39.725
All right, I hope you're all
having a great time.

39:39.859 --> 39:41.994
Goodnight.

39:42.127 --> 39:44.330
- Oh, disgusting.
- What?

39:44.464 --> 39:46.199
There's shit in the top part
of the toilet.

39:46.332 --> 39:48.267
An upper decker?
A what?

39:48.401 --> 39:50.803
It's when someone takes a shit
in the top of a toilet.

39:50.937 --> 39:52.972
Jesus, there's a name for it?

39:53.104 --> 39:55.274
Well, who did it?

39:55.408 --> 39:57.676
You think one of us did it?

39:57.810 --> 39:59.545
I mean, it did always smell
like shit in that bathroom.

39:59.678 --> 40:01.180
Just please hurry up
and get ready

40:01.314 --> 40:03.283
so we can leave this place.

40:10.156 --> 40:13.359
Um, Danny, can you lead the way?
Yeah. Becca?

40:13.493 --> 40:17.664
Thank you.

40:28.874 --> 40:30.575
Yeah. All good. Come on.

40:30.709 --> 40:33.178
Are you guys sure
we shouldn't just go home?

40:33.312 --> 40:35.548
What? No, we're going to
the festival.

40:35.682 --> 40:37.383
Don't let those assholes
ruin your trip.

40:37.517 --> 40:40.453
But the festival isn't
until tomorrow, right?

40:40.586 --> 40:43.489
You wanna go all the way home,
and then come all the way back?

40:43.622 --> 40:45.791
I don't know.
Babe, it'll be okay.

40:45.925 --> 40:47.294
We're going 50 miles
from here.

40:47.426 --> 40:49.495
We never have to come back.
Okay?

40:49.629 --> 40:52.566
All right. You're right. Yeah.
Come on.

40:52.698 --> 40:54.401
Thank you.

40:56.602 --> 40:58.638
Ladies and gentlemen,
hackers and homies,

40:58.771 --> 41:02.408
we are living in
unprecedented times right now.

41:02.542 --> 41:05.678
Terrorism via
mass communication,

41:05.812 --> 41:07.881
violence on the dark web,
and even death.

41:08.013 --> 41:11.684
All these modern-day
constructs made Bryan Rusty.

41:11.818 --> 41:15.220
The world treated him
like a monster. He became one.

41:15.354 --> 41:18.225
He defines us, you and me both.

41:20.093 --> 41:21.627
Ooh!

41:21.760 --> 41:26.231
Danger is around every corner,
and nobody is truly safe.

41:26.365 --> 41:28.301
Bryan is here to
remind you of that.

41:28.434 --> 41:30.069
Just like me.

41:30.202 --> 41:33.372
He and I have a shared mission.
A purpose.

41:33.506 --> 41:35.642
By the time we're done,
you're gonna hear all about it.

41:35.774 --> 41:38.110
On your screen or you're
bleeding on your floor.

41:38.243 --> 41:39.711
That's for sure.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.113
This is Sammy Psylocybin

41:41.247 --> 41:43.749
and you're watching
Terror Eyes TV.

41:46.051 --> 41:49.055
- Did you tell those guys where we were staying?
- No.

41:49.187 --> 41:51.825
- So, you didn't say anything whn they asked at the bar, right?
- No, Lisa.

41:51.957 --> 41:54.226
So, how did they find us then?
How am I supposed to know?

41:54.359 --> 41:58.731
Shane, what's up?

41:58.865 --> 42:02.301
<i>Hey, man. You guys okay?</i>
What are you talking about?

42:02.435 --> 42:05.672
<i>I'm asking if everything is okay.</i>
Yeah, why wouldn't they be?

42:05.805 --> 42:07.607
<i>Just...
You're with Lisa, right?</i>

42:07.740 --> 42:09.809
Of course.

42:09.943 --> 42:12.912
What makes you think
everything's not okay?

42:13.046 --> 42:16.683
<i>I'm checking in on you guys
and you're giving me shit?</i>

42:16.816 --> 42:20.220
You're getting too close.
Back off, man. Sorry.

42:22.821 --> 42:26.158
Do you still have that,
like, uh, wheel lock thing?

42:28.662 --> 42:30.530
Badass.

42:30.662 --> 42:35.434
This is gonna be the best
Terror Eyes video ever.

42:35.568 --> 42:37.836
Yo, this is Sammy Psylocybin,
and today,

42:37.970 --> 42:40.772
I'm taking you back
to the roots of Terror Eyes.

42:40.906 --> 42:42.274
You all saw the hit
and run video

42:42.408 --> 42:43.943
that got this shit started,

42:44.077 --> 42:47.513
and you've seen the brothers
all grown up, but right now,

42:47.647 --> 42:51.183
I'm at the house
where Bryan came of age.

42:51.316 --> 42:52.618
See that shed right there?

42:52.752 --> 42:54.554
That's where he used to plot
all his pranks

42:54.687 --> 42:56.656
and hack his way to the...
Hey!

42:56.789 --> 42:58.556
- Oh, shit.
- Who the hell are you?

42:58.691 --> 43:01.861
Oh, I'm just a big fan of Bryan.
I run the Terror Eyes TV.

43:01.995 --> 43:04.797
You've probably heard of me.
How did you get in here?

43:04.930 --> 43:06.065
I hopped a fence.

43:06.198 --> 43:08.068
This is private property, punk.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.601
Is that brass knuckles
right there?

43:09.734 --> 43:13.272
I should glue your goddamn
dick hole shut!

43:16.075 --> 43:17.777
- Danny?
- What's up?

43:20.479 --> 43:23.950
- I'm still not over you.
- What?

43:24.084 --> 43:26.051
You heard me.

43:26.185 --> 43:29.288
- You're not over me.
- No.

43:29.421 --> 43:32.257
Becca, that time has passed.

43:32.390 --> 43:34.493
No, we were always
getting back together.

43:34.627 --> 43:36.729
We could have made it work.

43:36.863 --> 43:38.030
And we still can.

43:38.164 --> 43:39.531
Are you crazy?
I'm with Lisa.

43:39.665 --> 43:43.569
And she's my best friend,
and I love her, but...

43:43.702 --> 43:46.438
Look, I honestly don't know
if... if...

43:46.573 --> 43:49.442
You don't know if what?

43:49.575 --> 43:51.243
If she's gonna say yes
when you propose.

43:51.377 --> 43:53.179
- What, did you tell her?
- No!

43:53.312 --> 43:54.747
But she's not happy.

43:54.881 --> 43:56.582
The whole Bryan thing
is too much for her.

43:56.716 --> 43:59.786
She can't take it anymore.

43:59.919 --> 44:02.021
Look, but I can.

44:02.155 --> 44:06.493
I still think you're the nicest,
most perfect guy I've ever met.

44:08.995 --> 44:10.396
I can't believe...
I mean, are you serious?

44:10.530 --> 44:12.064
Or is this some kind of joke?

44:16.468 --> 44:17.802
Well, I mean, thank you.

44:17.937 --> 44:20.140
Thank you for helping me
understand Lisa's feelings,

44:20.272 --> 44:22.408
but if you thought
I would dump her...

44:22.542 --> 44:25.877
Lisa's been amazing, amazing
putting up with me and Bryan.

44:26.011 --> 44:27.946
From now on, it's just
gonna be me and her. I swear.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.683
She's the one I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

44:30.816 --> 44:32.484
God, if she has doubts,
I'm gonna...

44:32.618 --> 44:35.754
I'll have to convince
her otherwise.

44:35.888 --> 44:37.557
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

44:37.691 --> 44:39.325
Hey.
Everything okay?

44:39.459 --> 44:42.294
Yeah, she's a little...
little shaken up.

44:42.428 --> 44:43.630
Okay, I get that.
From, uh, last night.

44:43.763 --> 44:46.165
Yeah. Ready to go?
Yeah.

44:46.298 --> 44:49.534
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

45:08.386 --> 45:10.356
So, Bryan's mom clocked me.

45:10.490 --> 45:13.693
She said that my videos
need to be more private,

45:13.825 --> 45:16.028
and that I talk too much,
and that I post too much.

45:16.162 --> 45:18.763
Which is basically the same shit
that Bryan's pissed about.

45:18.897 --> 45:21.434
But it's, like, I don't think
they understand how much work

45:21.568 --> 45:23.002
is really involved
in what I do.

45:23.135 --> 45:25.771
I remix the videos.
I make the music better.

45:25.905 --> 45:27.272
Maybe you're just jealous
of my skills.

45:27.406 --> 45:28.774
Is that what it is, Bryan?

45:28.908 --> 45:30.443
'Cause I'm making
the lifetime-style

45:30.575 --> 45:32.144
documentary that you wanna make
about yourself?

45:32.278 --> 45:33.479
Well, guess what?

45:33.611 --> 45:35.548
Nobody knows Bryan better
than I do,

45:35.682 --> 45:37.515
and I'm gonna make the best
shit that he's ever seen.

45:37.649 --> 45:40.218
By the way, Bryan,
Lisa loves Danny again.

45:40.352 --> 45:44.857
Sorry.

45:44.990 --> 45:47.394
Think you've got
enough footage, Danny?

45:47.526 --> 45:49.828
It's really beautiful here.
This is really nice.

45:49.961 --> 45:52.731
Look at these trees!
Man, they're crazy.

45:52.865 --> 45:55.502
The trees
for which the park is named.

45:55.635 --> 45:57.502
That's why
they call it Joshua Tree.

45:57.636 --> 45:59.772
Who's Joshua, anyway?
I don't know.

45:59.906 --> 46:02.142
He's a guy that looked
like these trees, I guess.

46:07.580 --> 46:09.782
- So, these mountains are man-made.
- What?

46:09.915 --> 46:12.017
Isn't that crazy?
All the rocks and everything?

46:12.151 --> 46:16.489
Yeah, right.

46:17.289 --> 46:18.823
Man, you would
think that after having

46:18.957 --> 46:21.059
this camera for four days,
my arms should be used to it,

46:21.193 --> 46:23.495
but I'm just getting
a little tired over here.

46:23.629 --> 46:25.698
Got a nice
pump going in your biceps?

46:25.832 --> 46:29.502
- You know, just for you, babe.
- Thank you, baby.

46:29.635 --> 46:31.269
Lot of snakes out here, I bet.

46:31.403 --> 46:35.607
Oh, hell no.

46:35.740 --> 46:38.376
Oh, I love this.

46:38.510 --> 46:40.746
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

46:49.187 --> 46:50.689
Yo, here's the news.

46:50.823 --> 46:52.925
Sources tell me that Bryan
is puttin' together a movie

46:53.059 --> 46:55.227
with clips
from the website, live videos,

46:55.361 --> 46:57.597
and footage that
he's either hacked or stolen.

46:57.731 --> 47:00.366
Now, this film is gonna be
based on his trip to the desert

47:00.499 --> 47:04.703
before his parents send him to
military school aka detention,

47:04.836 --> 47:06.271
and I can guarantee you
one thing.

47:06.405 --> 47:09.274
He's going to make himself
the hero of this film.

47:09.408 --> 47:12.879
And two, he's gonna make me
look like a complete asshole

47:13.011 --> 47:16.015
even though I have
encouraged him this entire time,

47:16.149 --> 47:20.819
I have championed his brand,
and I have amplified his voice.

47:20.952 --> 47:23.588
Oh, wait.
Bryan don't have no voice.

47:25.357 --> 47:27.426
We got here before there's
a whole lot of people here.

47:27.560 --> 47:30.997
This is really nice.

47:31.129 --> 47:32.698
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

47:32.832 --> 47:34.501
Uh, I just need a day pass
for the car.

47:34.633 --> 47:36.168
Yeah, that's $15
for the vehicle.

47:36.301 --> 47:38.970
Sure.

47:39.104 --> 47:40.173
- Howdy.
- Mornin'!

47:40.305 --> 47:43.742
- How much for a day pass?
- $15.

47:43.876 --> 47:46.044
- How much do you get paid here?
- Becca.

47:46.178 --> 47:47.879
No, it's not about the money.

47:48.013 --> 47:51.249
- I enjoy servicing the National Park.
- Servicing?

47:51.383 --> 47:53.651
- You think I can get a job here?
- Stop it.

47:53.785 --> 47:55.120
- What?
- I don't see why not.

47:55.254 --> 47:56.456
You're pretty enough.

47:56.589 --> 47:57.924
Really? Pretty enough?

47:58.057 --> 48:00.359
I just wanna thank you
and express my gratitude

48:00.493 --> 48:02.495
for everything
you guys do here.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.163
I'm actually from this valley.

48:04.296 --> 48:07.532
We all think it's sacred,
so, uh, good job.

48:07.665 --> 48:09.868
Oh, I appreciate that.

48:10.002 --> 48:12.404
I mean, it hasn't been
completely contaminated

48:12.537 --> 48:15.574
yet by developers
or asshole tourists.

48:15.707 --> 48:18.177
No, but there are a few.

48:18.310 --> 48:19.745
I'm sure.

48:19.879 --> 48:21.814
- Thanks, Dick.
- Whoa, Rebecca.

48:21.948 --> 48:23.216
What? That's his name, right?

48:23.348 --> 48:25.251
- Thank you very much, sir.
- God.

48:25.383 --> 48:27.185
Hey, speaking of, uh, tourists,

48:27.319 --> 48:29.821
I have a couple of good friends
in town that are visiting.

48:29.955 --> 48:31.524
They got here
a couple minutes before us.

48:31.656 --> 48:34.325
Girl in the front seat, blonde
hair, real pretty, driving.

48:34.459 --> 48:35.794
They went straight ahead?

48:35.928 --> 48:37.530
They didn't go left
or right or turn...

48:37.662 --> 48:38.897
Yeah, no, no.
They were just here.

48:39.031 --> 48:40.700
Thank you, Richard.
You have a great day.

48:40.832 --> 48:43.301
<i>Richard, got your hipsters
coming into the park.</i>

48:43.435 --> 48:47.039
<i>Don't worry,
I'll put 'em in their...</i>

48:47.173 --> 48:49.107
So, how far back do you think
we need to go to park?

48:49.242 --> 48:51.544
This is pretty far back.
I know, seriously.

48:51.676 --> 48:53.945
I mean, we're pretty far
from the ranger's station.

48:54.078 --> 48:58.084
I'm saying, the farther we can
drive, the less we have to walk.

48:58.216 --> 49:01.586
Everybody better
put their sunblock on.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.656
Okay, mom.
Is this Joshua Tree?

49:03.789 --> 49:05.089
Yep, that's the tree.
That's it.

49:05.223 --> 49:07.193
They put a trashcan next to it.

49:16.669 --> 49:17.837
Okay,
so Echo Tree is to the left,

49:17.970 --> 49:20.004
and Barker Dam
is to the right.

49:20.138 --> 49:23.209
What do you think?
Mm, I say Echo Tree.

49:23.341 --> 49:25.176
Fine by me.

49:25.310 --> 49:26.646
- Whoa.
- What?

49:26.778 --> 49:28.079
What's this?

49:28.214 --> 49:29.782
There was a bullet on
the seat?

49:29.914 --> 49:33.719
What?
Think it was those guys?

49:37.555 --> 49:39.425
They're taking
Echo Tree trail.

49:39.559 --> 49:41.961
Yes, they are.

49:42.095 --> 49:43.696
When's the last time
you slept, man?

49:43.828 --> 49:46.664
A couple days, man.
That's the beauty of drugs.

49:46.798 --> 49:49.601
I can sleep when they're dead.

49:55.207 --> 49:58.810
Ah, you forgot something, man.
Think fast.

50:03.716 --> 50:04.884
First, I'm gonna smash

50:05.017 --> 50:07.452
that asshole's head in.

50:07.586 --> 50:09.722
Then, I'm gonna make
those bitches wish

50:09.856 --> 50:11.390
they'd never been born.

50:11.524 --> 50:15.093
Then, I'm gonna seriously
handicap that special needs kid

50:15.227 --> 50:19.365
and post pictures of his boiled
meat face all over Terror Eyes.

50:20.298 --> 50:23.001
My back is
killing me from driving.

50:23.135 --> 50:25.169
'Cause somebody had to film
the whole time

50:25.303 --> 50:26.572
and didn't wanna drive.

50:26.705 --> 50:28.140
Hey, I would've filmed
if you had asked.

50:28.274 --> 50:29.842
Filmed?
I know you would have filmed.

50:29.975 --> 50:31.611
You're always filming.
I mean drove.

50:31.743 --> 50:34.814
I'm just really excited
about this camera, you guys.

50:34.946 --> 50:36.915
I know, that's why I didn't
let you... make you drive.

50:37.050 --> 50:38.783
I figured you'd wanna shoot.

50:50.629 --> 50:54.032
My panoramics are totally
kicking your time-lapse's asses.

50:54.165 --> 50:57.970
Kick... what?

50:58.104 --> 50:59.805
I feel so safe with you here,
Danny.

50:59.937 --> 51:02.240
Everything finally feels right.

51:02.374 --> 51:03.675
I missed you.

51:03.809 --> 51:05.676
I missed us.

51:05.810 --> 51:09.682
I missed you too, baby.
But I'm back.

51:09.814 --> 51:13.452
We're back.

51:13.586 --> 51:17.857
Hipster rock bullshit.

51:17.990 --> 51:21.593
Listen.
The wind is making that noise.

51:21.727 --> 51:22.861
The wind sucks through the bark.

51:22.995 --> 51:26.899
It gives me the creeps.

51:27.033 --> 51:30.368
Sounds like an evil harmonica.

52:00.665 --> 52:03.403
Big rock.

52:15.647 --> 52:17.717
There they are!

52:18.651 --> 52:19.919
What was that?

52:20.053 --> 52:23.256
I don't know.
I heard something.

52:26.857 --> 52:28.193
You guys think it was
that ranger?

52:28.327 --> 52:29.627
Yeah, he's got nothing
better to do

52:29.761 --> 52:31.497
than follow us around all day.

52:31.631 --> 52:35.100
Come on.

52:35.234 --> 52:37.002
- Look, it's a murder of crows.
- A what?

52:37.135 --> 52:39.437
A flock of crows
is called a murder.

52:39.571 --> 52:41.807
- That's weird.
- Do you know what a group of parrots is called?

52:41.939 --> 52:44.008
No.
A flock.

52:44.142 --> 52:45.877
Camels are a flock, too.

52:46.010 --> 52:48.546
A group of hyenas
is called a clan.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.616
Owls are a Parliament.

52:50.749 --> 52:52.417
Wasps fly in a colony.

52:52.551 --> 52:55.487
Then there's a herd of deer,
a school of fish...

52:55.620 --> 52:59.957
A bunch of dead meat!
Welcome to the jungle, bitches.

53:00.091 --> 53:01.593
Did you follow us here?

53:01.727 --> 53:03.196
We belong here. You don't.

53:03.328 --> 53:05.798
No, this is a public park.
Just leave us alone!

53:05.930 --> 53:07.832
This guy keeps on filming.

53:07.966 --> 53:09.301
Mike, get his camera.
Give me yours.

53:09.435 --> 53:11.738
Stay back!
Get the fuck away from us!

53:11.870 --> 53:13.338
Nope, I'm gonna be taking that.
Danny, run!

53:13.472 --> 53:14.839
I'm not leaving. I got this.

53:14.972 --> 53:16.274
Just go! Go get help!

53:16.408 --> 53:18.910
Don't you... don't move.

53:19.044 --> 53:20.578
You just gonna leave your girl
like that?

53:20.711 --> 53:21.946
What're you gonna do?

53:22.080 --> 53:24.582
Oh, I'm gonna fucking
kill you!

53:24.716 --> 53:26.385
Get over here! You're dead!

53:26.517 --> 53:30.222
Ah, your boyfriend is a class
a puss...

53:30.356 --> 53:31.857
Aah!

53:31.990 --> 53:36.127
Quick! Get on your back.
Stay there.

53:39.631 --> 53:41.900
See what she made me do?

53:42.033 --> 53:43.468
Guess what?

53:43.602 --> 53:45.304
This was all supposed
to be a scam!

53:45.437 --> 53:47.006
You were just supposed to be
another notch in my belt.

53:47.138 --> 53:48.406
This is all your fault!
I'm sorry!

53:48.539 --> 53:50.408
Just another chick I was
gonna get down with.

53:50.542 --> 53:52.044
Where's Bryan?

53:52.178 --> 53:53.546
I don't know!
Where is he?

53:53.678 --> 53:55.780
- I don't know!
- Ugh.

53:55.914 --> 53:58.449
No! No!

54:02.888 --> 54:04.890
Bryan!

54:05.024 --> 54:06.625
Thank you.
Oh, my God, thank you!

54:06.758 --> 54:10.296
Becca!

54:10.428 --> 54:12.664
You okay?

54:16.767 --> 54:19.804
I'm so sorry.

54:26.845 --> 54:28.481
You can't run forever!

54:28.613 --> 54:32.184
Honey?

54:33.986 --> 54:38.056
I'm so sorry.
Rebecca, please wake up.

54:38.189 --> 54:41.560
I'm so sorry.

54:48.167 --> 54:50.603
Right here, right here!

54:50.736 --> 54:52.404
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Somebody call the cops!

54:52.537 --> 54:54.472
These girls are in trouble!
This guy... oh, my God.

54:54.606 --> 54:56.073
Two girls are in trouble
at Echo Tree!

54:56.207 --> 54:57.876
This guy and his friend
are trying to kill us!

54:58.010 --> 54:59.176
That guy is trying to kill us!

54:59.310 --> 55:00.646
That's him, that's the guy
right here!

55:00.780 --> 55:02.113
This is the guy!
Hey!

55:02.247 --> 55:03.848
Wanna come after me?
This is my bus!

55:03.982 --> 55:05.417
You want some?

55:07.252 --> 55:10.289
Get outta here.
Someone call the police!

55:10.656 --> 55:12.691
Joey!

55:12.825 --> 55:16.896
He's coming back! Run! Run!

55:17.028 --> 55:20.498
Joey. Wake up.
Joey. Joey, dude.

55:20.633 --> 55:22.868
Wake up. What happened?

55:23.002 --> 55:26.772
Joey.

55:34.646 --> 55:37.917
- Lisa!
- Danny! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

55:38.050 --> 55:41.486
I can't believe you're alive.
What happened?

55:41.620 --> 55:43.522
He killed Rebecca.
They were about to kill me.

55:43.655 --> 55:45.992
Bryan came out of nowhere
and saved me.

55:46.124 --> 55:47.858
It's okay.

55:47.993 --> 55:49.261
Come here.
Oh, my God.

55:49.394 --> 55:50.995
- I'm sorry I left.
- I thought you were dead.

55:56.068 --> 55:57.569
You did it, Bryan.
You're finally the hero.

55:57.702 --> 56:00.272
Lisa must really love you now.
Yeah, right.

56:00.405 --> 56:01.908
While we're on the subject
of Lisa,

56:02.040 --> 56:03.742
here's some old text messages
that I hacked.

56:03.874 --> 56:05.243
Cockstain60 asks,

56:05.377 --> 56:07.879
"Bryan, you obviously
wanna bang Lisa.

56:08.013 --> 56:09.281
Why not take her by force?"

56:09.414 --> 56:11.582
Pipebombdiaper asks,
"Bryan, what if Lisa

56:11.716 --> 56:13.484
never chooses
you over your brother?"

56:13.618 --> 56:16.489
Bryan said, "Then she'll be sent
to heaven where she belongs."

56:16.622 --> 56:19.156
Well, she is choosing
your brother over you, Bryan.

56:19.290 --> 56:21.193
So, what're you gonna do?

56:26.966 --> 56:28.200
Hey, what's with
the uni-bomber?

56:28.334 --> 56:30.502
Did he have anything
to do with this?

56:30.635 --> 56:31.869
It was self-defense.

56:32.004 --> 56:34.339
They killed Rebecca and they
were about to kill me.

56:34.472 --> 56:36.975
You can check their camera.
They filmed everything.

56:42.781 --> 56:45.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back it up there, freakshow.

56:45.584 --> 56:48.053
Give me this camera.

57:02.334 --> 57:03.702
This from the kid's camera?

57:03.836 --> 57:07.073
Yep.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.490
Look at the videos
on his laptop, man.

57:24.622 --> 57:26.291
He's been putting stuff
together.

57:41.272 --> 57:45.010
♪ What you learned
in school was ♪

57:45.142 --> 57:48.079
♪ To get some evil
in you 'cause ♪

57:48.213 --> 57:53.618
♪ The things they do to you
will just leave you crying ♪

57:55.220 --> 57:58.991
♪ What you learned in school
was ♪ Bryan!

57:59.124 --> 58:01.327
♪ To get some evil in you ♪

58:01.459 --> 58:03.160
Bryan!

58:03.294 --> 58:06.597
Hey, I'm comin' in, okay?

58:06.731 --> 58:11.001
Hey, I thought I told you
not to post videos like that.

58:11.135 --> 58:12.703
Don't you lie to me.
I know it was you.

58:12.838 --> 58:16.274
I could see your sleeves.

58:16.408 --> 58:19.377
Monday.
You're going on Monday.

58:19.510 --> 58:21.146
It's gonna... don't tell me
to get out, Bryan.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.848
I'm talking to you.

58:22.981 --> 58:25.149
I'm having
a conversation with...

58:25.283 --> 58:29.622
don't you... you watch it.

58:53.377 --> 58:55.080
Number one or number two?

58:55.213 --> 58:56.481
Number one.

58:56.615 --> 58:58.517
How much money they have on 'em?

58:58.649 --> 58:59.950
About $200.

59:00.084 --> 59:01.920
- Check the bags?
- Yeah.

59:02.053 --> 59:05.890
- Did you check the car?
- Yeah.

59:06.024 --> 59:08.426
And she's done.
I can see that.

59:08.560 --> 59:10.962
Well, then go get her
back to the cell.

59:11.095 --> 59:12.798
<i>Oh, this is gross in here.</i>

59:23.107 --> 59:25.810
Yo, looks like Kylo
Ren stepping up to us?

59:25.943 --> 59:27.779
Eat bags of shit.

59:27.912 --> 59:29.581
Fucked up.

59:32.184 --> 59:34.151
You dress like a ninja?
Come on.

59:34.285 --> 59:36.155
Show us some moves, homie.

59:38.289 --> 59:41.593
Show us some ninja moves.

59:45.997 --> 59:48.032
Oh, shit!

59:54.906 --> 59:58.109
Getting some messages
in the chat.

59:58.243 --> 01:00:00.412
"Sam, you're playing with fire."

01:00:00.544 --> 01:00:03.948
"Sam, are you butt-hurt
that Bryan's mom yelled at you?"

01:00:04.082 --> 01:00:05.417
Yeah, actually, I am.

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:08.220
My turn to DJ.
I hate your classical crap.

01:00:13.624 --> 01:00:16.160
I hope it's a long engagement.

01:00:16.294 --> 01:00:18.095
Why?

01:00:18.229 --> 01:00:19.763
It's gonna be a big adjustment
for him.

01:00:19.897 --> 01:00:21.432
It's gonna take
some getting used to.

01:00:21.566 --> 01:00:23.702
Come on, guys!
I know.

01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:26.805
Never look into his camera
and never,

01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:28.473
ever show him yours, okay?

01:00:28.606 --> 01:00:30.774
Well, Bryan is
just always there.

01:00:30.908 --> 01:00:35.613
Danny!
I love your new toy.

01:00:35.747 --> 01:00:37.449
Or people just ignore him.
Like we do.

01:00:37.582 --> 01:00:40.285
Yeah, but that's what he wants.
Is it?

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:41.886
Sorry, guys.

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:45.590
Just putting Bryan to bed.

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:50.195
Bryan, let's go!

01:00:52.363 --> 01:00:55.066
What makes you think
everything's not okay?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.502
<i>I'm checking in on you guys
and you're giving me shit?</i>

01:00:57.635 --> 01:00:59.036
Have you been texting
with Bryan?

01:00:59.169 --> 01:01:02.473
<i>I don't text with
that deformed retard.</i>

01:01:02.606 --> 01:01:04.175
<i>Am I on speaker phone?</i>

01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:07.178
Yep.

01:01:07.312 --> 01:01:11.083
There's a bullet on the seat?
What?

01:01:11.216 --> 01:01:12.751
You can take a
different trail now, Bryan.

01:01:12.885 --> 01:01:16.053
Yeah.
Take a hike away from us for once.

01:01:16.187 --> 01:01:17.789
They treat him
like a burlap sack.

01:01:17.923 --> 01:01:21.593
No wonder he gets into shit
like this.

01:01:21.727 --> 01:01:23.662
Post pictures of his
boiled meat face all over

01:01:23.794 --> 01:01:28.032
- Terror Eyes.
- He's a little piss ant.

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:31.203
Listen to these messages
I used to send Bryan. Hey, B.

01:01:31.336 --> 01:01:32.838
I've reached out a few times

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:34.839
because I'm, like,
your biggest fan,

01:01:34.973 --> 01:01:36.975
and I'm a good hacker
just like you,

01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:39.244
and I just wanna know
if you need somebody to work

01:01:39.377 --> 01:01:40.979
for you
in some official capacity,

01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:43.013
maybe like an apprenticeship
or something.

01:01:43.147 --> 01:01:44.450
If you do, I'm your man.

01:01:44.582 --> 01:01:46.151
Hit me up, B. Let me know.
Please.

01:01:46.283 --> 01:01:47.885
No answer.

01:01:48.019 --> 01:01:49.854
I followed up with stuff
like "checking in"

01:01:49.988 --> 01:01:53.290
and "gentle reminder"
and then Bryan sends me this.

01:01:53.425 --> 01:01:55.660
"Yo, kid, you bother me.
I don't need help.

01:01:55.794 --> 01:01:57.429
"Help yourself
and fix your hair.

01:01:57.562 --> 01:02:01.267
"Don't be a kiss ass.
Plus, your vids are kinda wack."

01:02:07.906 --> 01:02:09.774
Bryan?

01:02:09.908 --> 01:02:11.844
Did you know
who those guys were?

01:02:16.013 --> 01:02:17.281
What did he say?

01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:19.151
They're recording us
in the bathroom.

01:02:19.285 --> 01:02:21.620
What? Bryan.
I asked you a question.

01:02:21.754 --> 01:02:25.357
Lisa, they're recording us.
I don't care.

01:02:29.894 --> 01:02:32.665
Bryan, come on, man,
let's go.

01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:39.171
Do you have something
to tell us?

01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.405
Lees, what's goin' on?

01:02:41.539 --> 01:02:44.008
You told those guys
to harass us, didn't you?

01:02:44.142 --> 01:02:45.977
That's how they knew
where we were staying,

01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:47.780
everywhere we went.

01:02:55.319 --> 01:02:56.854
They killed my best friend

01:02:56.988 --> 01:02:59.590
and they were gonna kill
both of us!

01:02:59.725 --> 01:03:02.560
What'd he say?
He says he saved your life.

01:03:02.693 --> 01:03:04.729
Is that why you did this?

01:03:04.863 --> 01:03:07.698
So you could be a hero?
Just like Danny was?

01:03:07.832 --> 01:03:09.835
Well, your little plan didn't
really work out great, did it?

01:03:09.968 --> 01:03:11.536
I asked if you could be cool
on this trip.

01:03:11.669 --> 01:03:13.538
I said no pranks!

01:03:13.671 --> 01:03:14.839
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.

01:03:14.972 --> 01:03:16.540
I knew it was a mistake
to bring you.

01:03:16.673 --> 01:03:18.109
This is what we get
for trying to include you!

01:03:18.243 --> 01:03:21.013
Hey, remember when that kid
went pee earlier?

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:27.285
- How does he know that's a camera?
- I don't know.

01:03:27.419 --> 01:03:28.987
Well, how did he find it?
Beats me.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.156
I told those rangers that you
did this in self-defense.

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:32.591
I-I have to tell them.

01:03:32.723 --> 01:03:34.459
I have to make sure
that you stay as locked up

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:36.161
and far away
from me as possible.

01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:38.864
Now two can play at terror.
I told you I know how to hack,

01:03:38.997 --> 01:03:41.732
and that includes videos
on your website, Bryan.

01:03:41.867 --> 01:03:43.734
It's time to unmask
the mask-maker.

01:03:43.868 --> 01:03:46.538
You're filming him! Stop!
Jesus Christ.

01:03:46.671 --> 01:03:47.906
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
I'm sorry!

01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:49.306
I don't...
I don't know what happened.

01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:52.243
- Aah!
- Shut it off!

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:56.415
Help! We need help in here!
Help us!

01:03:56.548 --> 01:03:58.082
- Oh, shit!
- I knew it!

01:03:58.216 --> 01:04:01.419
Stop, Bryan!

01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:03.722
Easy, easy.

01:04:03.854 --> 01:04:07.258
He got my gun!

01:04:12.531 --> 01:04:14.499
Bryan, put the gun down.

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:16.267
This is really bad, man.

01:04:16.401 --> 01:04:18.103
There's no coming back
from this.

01:04:18.236 --> 01:04:20.604
You just want me to say it,
don't you?

01:04:20.738 --> 01:04:23.375
I'm the reason
it came to this.

01:04:23.508 --> 01:04:25.008
Or course you brought
your phone in here.

01:04:25.142 --> 01:04:29.714
All right.
So, I'll admit it.

01:04:29.847 --> 01:04:32.916
That day, on the bike,

01:04:33.051 --> 01:04:34.553
I pushed you.

01:04:34.685 --> 01:04:35.988
I know there's video,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.754
but if you went back
to the original footage,

01:04:37.888 --> 01:04:40.057
you'd see something
you hadn't seen before.

01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:42.995
You'd see what really happened.
I changed the tape.

01:04:43.127 --> 01:04:45.430
Nobody saw me do it,
so I photoshopped my arm,

01:04:45.562 --> 01:04:48.066
and it looked like you
fell by yourself.

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:50.269
I knew the cops would ask
for my video.

01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:52.069
I swear I didn't know
there was a car coming.

01:04:52.203 --> 01:04:53.638
I thought you'd just fall
into the grass,

01:04:53.771 --> 01:04:56.640
but you rolled
into the street and...

01:04:56.774 --> 01:05:01.446
I'm so sorry, man.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.081
I know I've ruined your life.

01:05:03.214 --> 01:05:05.417
And it kills me inside,
but I love you,

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:06.952
and you're my brother,

01:05:07.084 --> 01:05:09.720
and getting married
isn't gonna change any of that.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:23.434
Lisa and Shane?

01:05:23.568 --> 01:05:25.236
Bryan!

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:27.539
Don't touch her!

01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:29.573
Lisa! Lisa!

01:05:29.707 --> 01:05:31.475
Stop!

01:06:31.535 --> 01:06:33.304
Festivalgoers
in the Coachella Valley

01:06:33.437 --> 01:06:36.807
were on edge this weekend as law
enforcement tripled personnel

01:06:36.941 --> 01:06:39.912
during an ongoing manhunt
for Bryan Rusty.

01:06:40.044 --> 01:06:41.812
The Southern California
teen escaped custody

01:06:41.946 --> 01:06:43.914
from a local precinct
on Friday

01:06:44.048 --> 01:06:46.316
and remains a suspect
in multiple homicides.

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:49.220
The public was not aware of
the fugitive or his whereabouts

01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:51.656
until after the first day
of the event.

01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:53.123
But after the story broke,

01:06:53.258 --> 01:06:55.193
a number of attendees
identified Rusty

01:06:55.327 --> 01:06:58.796
in their own video footage
and many are uploading clips.

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:00.598
Bryan is believed to have
entered the festival

01:07:00.731 --> 01:07:03.867
and camouflaged himself among
of thousands of other visitors.

01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:05.269
Sources
tell us the original

01:07:05.403 --> 01:07:06.870
description of Bryan Rusty

01:07:07.004 --> 01:07:09.340
had officers looking for
a 16-year-old

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:11.410
in a black hoodie and ski mask,

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.644
but as this amateur
footage shows,

01:07:13.778 --> 01:07:15.647
he seems to have changed
his appearance

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.714
to throw authorities off track.

01:07:17.848 --> 01:07:19.249
That's right, David.

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:21.285
This footage is helping police
gather information

01:07:21.419 --> 01:07:23.955
and some individuals have
even taken it upon themselves

01:07:24.089 --> 01:07:26.691
to create supercuts
of the collective shots.

01:07:26.823 --> 01:07:29.626
This one from user
B-R-Y-R-X-O-X-O.

01:07:58.189 --> 01:08:00.892
Cockrocket15 writes,
"You scared, Sam?

01:08:01.026 --> 01:08:02.527
Bryan's on the loose, sucker!"

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.931
Jizzbullit writes, "One-two,
Bryan's coming for you."

01:08:06.064 --> 01:08:09.267
Dude. Reality check.
Bryan's not comin' for me.

01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:11.068
He's comin' for Lisa.

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.772
Bryan Rusty
is suspected of killing

01:08:15.906 --> 01:08:17.575
two Palm Desert residents

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:20.609
as well as two park rangers
in the Coachella Valley.

01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:23.046
You really think Bryan is still
hiding inside the festival?

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.314
He's not.

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:26.251
There's no footage of him
getting out.

01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:27.852
Yeah, that's by design.

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:30.020
Bryan knows when he
is on camera.

01:08:30.154 --> 01:08:33.957
So, Danny admitted he pushed
Bryan under the car.

01:08:34.091 --> 01:08:36.127
- Class act, that boy.
- What?

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.127
His father lived with that guilt
for 10 years.

01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:40.765
Where did you hear that?
You heard it, too.

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.700
You were in that cell
with those boys.

01:08:42.832 --> 01:08:45.102
Wait, have you been
talking to Bryan?

01:08:45.236 --> 01:08:46.370
Of course not.

01:08:46.504 --> 01:08:48.606
Then how else
would you know all of that?

01:08:48.738 --> 01:08:51.642
Have you heard from Shane?
Why would I?

01:08:51.774 --> 01:08:53.377
I know about you two.

01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:55.412
And Danny was gonna propose.

01:08:55.546 --> 01:08:57.348
Look, Shane and I had a fling.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:00.015
But while I was on that trip,
I fell in love with Danny again.

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:02.252
I just needed a little
perspective.

01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:05.223
And now he's gone forever
because of Bryan.

01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:08.091
I mean, I bought a gun today.
I'm scared.

01:09:08.225 --> 01:09:09.694
It sounds like you've been
talking to...

01:09:09.828 --> 01:09:11.529
Tell Shane to call his mother.

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:26.542
I don't... I have no idea
what those French words mean.

01:09:26.676 --> 01:09:29.212
Um, marry me?

01:09:29.345 --> 01:09:30.680
Oh, stupid.

01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:33.952
Marion, how did you get that?

01:09:34.084 --> 01:09:36.185
Can you send it to me?
Please?

01:09:39.221 --> 01:09:42.426
Listen to me. Don't do it.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.029
You were going to leave Danny.

01:09:44.162 --> 01:09:46.064
You know nothing
about Danny and me.

01:09:46.196 --> 01:09:47.863
You're a cheater just like me.

01:09:50.801 --> 01:09:52.737
You disgusting creature!

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.404
I saved your life.

01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:55.806
You were supposed to say...

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.275
Bryan! Thank you.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:09:59.077
He came out of nowhere
and saved me.

01:09:59.209 --> 01:10:01.111
Get this through
your sick head.

01:10:01.245 --> 01:10:04.449
My only goal from now on is to
find you and to take you down.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:07.519
Do you understand that?

01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:13.325
Bryan, are you in my house?

01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:15.627
<i>I don't text with that deformed
retard... deformed retard.</i>

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.029
Shane!

01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:20.866
Please, stop.
Shane, where are you?

01:10:20.998 --> 01:10:22.699
If Bryan isn't found
by tomorrow,

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.202
I'm turning in my mother.

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.069
She's been enabling
that punk this whole time,

01:10:26.204 --> 01:10:28.907
and they both belong
in a mental ward.

01:10:36.547 --> 01:10:39.884
Bryan? Oh, my God!

01:10:42.753 --> 01:10:44.320
No, stop!

01:10:44.454 --> 01:10:46.823
No, don't, please!
Someone help me!

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:48.927
Please, stop! No!

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:54.999
I will fucking kill you!

01:10:55.132 --> 01:10:56.501
Do it.
They're all watching.

01:11:07.712 --> 01:11:10.281
Ding-dong, the dick is dead.
Let me tell you something.

01:11:10.414 --> 01:11:13.450
This is why it pays to stay
uncensored, speak your mind,

01:11:13.583 --> 01:11:15.653
and retaliate
whenever someone does you wrong.

01:11:15.785 --> 01:11:18.623
Even if your opponent
is the great and mighty Bryan,

01:11:18.756 --> 01:11:22.093
who, in this case,
was neither great nor mighty.

01:11:25.395 --> 01:11:27.064
Bryan?

01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:29.700
You're alive?

01:11:32.169 --> 01:11:34.872
What's up, bro?
Thanks for reaching out.

01:11:41.812 --> 01:11:45.583
Your mom, she came at me
with brass knuckles, dude.

01:11:45.717 --> 01:11:48.486
Bryan, I am so sorry, dude.
I am so sorry.

01:11:50.888 --> 01:11:52.556
Lisa has had it coming
for a long time.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:54.893
I know how much you like her,
but if she goes

01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:56.961
to the authorities,
she's our next target.

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:58.529
Do you understand, honey?

01:11:58.663 --> 01:12:02.900
Marion, you condoned Bryan's
activities within this group.

01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:04.201
Mrs. Rusty, do you have

01:12:04.334 --> 01:12:05.970
any knowledge
of Bryan's whereabouts?

01:12:06.104 --> 01:12:09.207
How could I?
He's probably dead.

01:12:12.209 --> 01:12:14.078
Come on, man, you know
everything that I do is for you.

01:12:14.212 --> 01:12:17.549
I love you, B.

01:12:21.352 --> 01:12:23.654
They asked me to take all
the footage and give it to them.

01:12:23.788 --> 01:12:27.058
Dude, I don't know what to do.

01:12:27.191 --> 01:12:29.894
This surveillance footage
was acquired yesterday

01:12:30.026 --> 01:12:31.328
at Limitless Liquor,

01:12:31.462 --> 01:12:34.766
less than a mile
from their home.

01:12:34.899 --> 01:12:37.068
- How do you know it's him?
- Please.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.837
- You can't even see his face.
- Then who was that?

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:41.038
It's none of your business.

01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:43.140
Was it a friend?
A stranger?

01:12:43.274 --> 01:12:45.376
Yes, a stranger to me.
Still is.

01:12:45.508 --> 01:12:48.678
Mrs. Rusty, you'll remain
in custody downtown.

01:12:48.812 --> 01:12:51.882
And as soon as they find him,
you'll stay in custody.

01:12:52.016 --> 01:12:55.086
You will never find him!
He found you once.

01:12:55.218 --> 01:12:58.222
He will find you again!
He'll find all of you!

01:12:58.355 --> 01:12:59.956
He'll find all of you!

01:13:00.091 --> 01:13:03.127
Bryan, you gotta tell me what I
can do to get out of this, man.

01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:06.196
What? No!
What're you doing?

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:09.199
Ah!

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.868
Get off me! You freak! You...

01:13:12.003 --> 01:13:14.939
Ow. Ow! Get off me!

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:20.645
You're the hero, Bryan!

01:13:20.778 --> 01:13:23.047
You win! Come on, man!

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:24.649
We're like brothers!

01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:26.851
All my brothers are dead!

01:13:54.412 --> 01:13:57.914
Whoo!
Fucking Bryan.
