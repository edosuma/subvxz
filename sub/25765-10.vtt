00:00.010 --> 00:02.200
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:02.220 --> 00:04.850
You will appeal. We'll find a
way to make you look sincere.

00:04.860 --> 00:06.519
Kim, I was sincere!

00:06.520 --> 00:09.940
- You don't believe me.
- I drop everything for you!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.610
You want to know why the
committee called you insincere?

00:12.620 --> 00:14.480
Because you didn't mention Chuck.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.620
He's got a chicken farm way out of town.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.900
Show me.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.870
You want to see your wife?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.070
More than anything.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.640
Then finish the job.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.540
Get the lights.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.270
You still want to be a lawyer?

00:27.280 --> 00:29.900
- Yeah.

to add another "M" to the firm

05:12.620 --> 05:14.299

05:50.880 --> 05:54.180
Four or six nipples... it's interesting,

05:54.200 --> 05:58.260
but I submit to the court it's, uh...

05:58.570 --> 06:00.200
it's overkill.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.200
H-H-M-M.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.400

06:05.930 --> 06:07.660

He's got a three-and-a-half-hour
jump on us,

08:11.830 --> 08:13.480
but he started out on foot,

08:13.490 --> 08:15.650
which gives us a fighting chance.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.120
He doesn't have his passport,

08:17.130 --> 08:19.360
so he's probably not
headed to the airport.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.160
Doesn't know his way around town,

08:21.170 --> 08:22.990
but if he gets to a bus or a taxi,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.090
that's not gonna matter much.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.240

08:59.140 --> 09:01.060

09:03.140 --> 09:06.000
Hi. I was, uh, wondering
if you could help me.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.540
I arranged for my wife to wire me money

09:08.550 --> 09:11.070
from Frankfurt, Germany, to the U.S.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.910
The problem is,

09:12.920 --> 09:15.680
she didn't tell me which branch.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.650
Margarethe Ziegler.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.410
Oh, yes. I remember.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.150
He spoke of you both quite fondly.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.150
That means a lot.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.420
I feel bad we lost touch for so long.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.440
Well, you're here today, so...

10:33.560 --> 10:35.140
We saw the notice about

10:35.160 --> 10:38.190
- the law library dedication this weekend.
- Mm.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.080
And today was the anniversary of...

10:41.100 --> 10:43.100
I can't believe it's been a year.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.830
It still doesn't make any sense.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.310
Well...

10:53.480 --> 10:55.610
So nice to meet you.

10:55.620 --> 10:58.210
- God bless.
- Bless you.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.650
Very thoughtful.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.990
Boo-hoo-hoo.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.620
Boo-hoo.

11:13.570 --> 11:14.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.530
- You need some water?
- Coffee.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.199
And give me one of these bear claws,

11:18.200 --> 11:19.810
please. All right.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.350
You better pace yourself, though.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.470
It's gonna be a long day.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.760
Yeah.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.740
But, hey, we got customers already.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.240
That's a good sign.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.580
I was afraid no one would show up.

11:33.450 --> 11:34.710
How'd it look?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.240
How'd it feel?

11:38.460 --> 11:40.700
Felt like I looked sad.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.500
What's the headstone like?

11:44.560 --> 11:46.190
Oh, Howard picked the big one.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.460
But it's tasteful.

11:53.110 --> 11:57.960
♪ Hermoso cariño ♪

11:58.040 --> 12:02.350

12:56.220 --> 12:58.060
All right, just sign right
there at the bottom.

13:00.670 --> 13:03.080
Okay. Then we give you...
This is your receipt.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.950
Just make sure your party has valid I.D.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.460
when they pick up.

13:06.550 --> 13:07.860
- Anything else?
- No.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.440
All right. Have a good day.

13:09.850 --> 13:11.040
Can I help you?

13:11.150 --> 13:12.320
Uh, yes.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.660
It'd be wonderful if you could.

13:14.780 --> 13:17.980
I'm, uh, looking for a Werner Ziegler.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.280
Has he been in here in
the last few hours?

13:20.290 --> 13:22.120
I'm s... I'm sorry.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.900
Even if he was here,
it's not company policy

13:23.920 --> 13:25.150
to give out customer information.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.550
Even if he just walked in?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.120
I don't care about what he did.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.620
Well, I really can't.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.580
He is my brother-in-law,

13:31.640 --> 13:33.600
and we're very worried about him.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.060
He has early stage dementia,

13:35.070 --> 13:36.870
and on top of that, he's a diabetic.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.370
He doesn't have his medicine,

13:38.380 --> 13:40.470
and my wife is beside herself.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.880
Oh, no.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.110
Uh, W-We talked long-distance

13:45.120 --> 13:47.600
to their sister, Margarethe,
back in Germany.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.910
She said Werner called
ranting and raving,

13:49.920 --> 13:51.080
wanting her to send money,

13:51.090 --> 13:54.750
and, well, she said she did,

13:54.760 --> 13:56.220
to this branch.

13:56.230 --> 13:59.720
I have his insulin in a
cooler out in the car,

13:59.730 --> 14:03.370
and I was hoping I would
get here ahead of him.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.060
Look, yeah, he was here,

14:09.070 --> 14:10.270
but you missed him.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.720
He left about an hour ago.

14:14.310 --> 14:15.900
Oh, no, no.

14:15.910 --> 14:17.140
Damn.

14:17.150 --> 14:19.440
Just took the money and left?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.010
Yeah.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.440
Well, not right away.

14:22.450 --> 14:24.650
He made a couple calls on the pay phone,

14:24.660 --> 14:26.150
picked up his money, then left.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.920
And, what, just wandered off on foot?

14:28.930 --> 14:30.100
He got in a car.

14:30.140 --> 14:33.180
Um, I think one of his
calls was for a cab.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.340
You see what company?

14:34.370 --> 14:37.690
- Was it a regular taxi, car service?
- I didn't.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.130
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.430
Any chance that...

14:42.440 --> 14:44.950
that I might have a... a peek

14:44.980 --> 14:46.500
at your security video,

14:46.510 --> 14:47.740
see who got him?

14:50.680 --> 14:53.540
No.

14:53.550 --> 14:55.720
Oh. I get it.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.180
Not company policy.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.880
Then...

15:00.890 --> 15:04.220
could you tell me where
the nearest hospital is?

15:06.460 --> 15:08.220
He was here a good half-hour or so

15:08.250 --> 15:10.790
before his money order came through.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.890
He asked if his money came, but not yet.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.460
- You mind?
- Oh.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.520
Well, that's bad luck.

15:27.550 --> 15:30.920
- You can't see the car.
- Yeah.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.260
Thanks for your help.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.439
Sure.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.100
Good luck. Hope you find him.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.580
Can I see it?

16:20.870 --> 16:23.190
For what it's worth, I believe him.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.030
He said he'd be gone four days.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.630
He's not going to any cops.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.970
This is about him wanting
to see his wife,

16:28.980 --> 16:30.580
plain and simple.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.360
She's on a Lufthansa flight.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.610
Landing in Denver nine hours from now.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.250
Yeah.

16:43.660 --> 16:46.800
And your men will be there.

16:47.430 --> 16:49.140
And they'll follow her from the airport

16:49.150 --> 16:51.030
to wherever he's holed up.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.200
And then?

16:59.260 --> 17:01.510
There's another way to play this.

17:03.780 --> 17:06.099
If I can find him before
the wife gets here,

17:06.109 --> 17:08.440
let me bring him in and
finish what he started.

17:08.450 --> 17:10.940
His crew can't do it without him.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.660
If Ziegler disappears,

17:12.760 --> 17:15.480
you are left with the most
expensive hole in the ground

17:15.490 --> 17:18.460
this side of the Mississippi.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.180
You can find him?

17:23.260 --> 17:25.790
This is on me. I'll fix it.

17:30.470 --> 17:32.360
Yeah.

17:32.370 --> 17:33.900
You get everybody back in.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.240
Get them on the phone
to every cab company

17:36.250 --> 17:38.340
and car service. You make up a story.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.379
Find out who picked Ziegler up

17:40.380 --> 17:42.380
at the Travel Wire on Fourth.

17:43.210 --> 17:47.040
And start calling hotels...
here, Colorado, Arizona.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.940
He had to register under his own name...

17:48.950 --> 17:50.610
or his wife's.

17:53.890 --> 17:58.120
Pull the transcript on
the last call to his wife.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.120
Read it to me.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.070
What'd they talk about?

18:05.820 --> 18:07.900
No. After that.

18:07.910 --> 18:09.960
After the dog.

18:09.970 --> 18:14.000
They were gonna go on vacation.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.640
Baden-Baden.

18:17.650 --> 18:19.670
Natural springs.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.690
Hey, there.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.800
Did you find your brother-in-law?

18:36.820 --> 18:39.030
Is he okay?

18:41.710 --> 18:45.170
Yes, I'm calling for one of your guests.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.500
Um, Werner Ziegler.

18:47.510 --> 18:49.440
Right.

18:49.880 --> 18:54.480
Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.440
You're sure?

18:56.450 --> 18:58.680
And there's no reservation
under that name?

19:00.620 --> 19:04.050
♪ Con el amo De la plaza ♪

19:04.060 --> 19:07.950
♪ Hay Que tener más cuidado ♪

19:07.960 --> 19:11.060
♪ Porque lo ven muy tranquilo ♪

19:16.180 --> 19:18.740
I won't lie. It's been a tough year.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.330
But I'm proud to say
Hamlin Hamlin McGill

19:21.360 --> 19:23.370
is back and going strong.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.940
It's his lasting legacy,

19:26.150 --> 19:30.080
which is why this couldn't
be more appropriate.

19:30.190 --> 19:32.350
I know this would have
meant the world to him...

19:32.560 --> 19:35.220
a good and proper memorial

19:35.230 --> 19:39.160
for a man who was many things,

19:39.460 --> 19:40.920
but always a lawyer first.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.090
On behalf of the whole school,

19:43.100 --> 19:44.500
we want to thank you.

19:44.620 --> 19:45.760
Me?

19:45.820 --> 19:47.800
No, I didn't donate any of this.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.320
I'm just a guest.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.530
Really? Dude, I'm pretty
sure I heard someone say

19:51.540 --> 19:52.880
- you paid for all of it.
- Yeah.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.260
Well, I didn't.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.500
I wish I could take credit for it,

19:55.510 --> 19:56.540
but I can't.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.100
The invitation says "anonymous donor."

20:00.140 --> 20:01.880
I assumed that meant HHM.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.040
Huh.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.410
- Baked Brie?
- Don't mind if I do.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.600
Actually, I happen to know

20:07.630 --> 20:10.560
Mr. James McGill paid for
the reading room himself.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.800
Really?

20:11.860 --> 20:13.400
The brother did this?

20:13.420 --> 20:15.320
I saw him write the check.

20:15.330 --> 20:18.280
How much do you think this cost?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.930
- Hi, Rich.
- Hey.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.530
This is quite an event.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.140
Looks like half the attorneys
in the southwest are here.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.270
Yeah.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.870
- They all came for Chuck.
- Mm.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.100
I heard someone say

20:29.120 --> 20:31.360
that Jimmy paid for all this himself?

20:32.740 --> 20:35.980
He'd... prefer to remain anonymous.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.380
Oh. Mm. Mm. Well, where is he?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.750
I was hoping to say hello.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.520
Uh, he's around here somewhere.

20:43.660 --> 20:47.050
Oh. Isn't that him out there?

20:47.060 --> 20:48.560
Hmm.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.950
I guess even a year out,

20:50.980 --> 20:53.000
an event like this can be tough.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.730
I better go check on him.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.530
- Thanks for coming, Rich.
- Yeah.

21:09.550 --> 21:12.840
It's almost time to go back in.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.560
$23,000.

21:19.230 --> 21:23.120
I can't believe I wrote a
$23,000 check for this.

21:23.130 --> 21:24.330
You know?

21:25.440 --> 21:26.860
I don't even see anyone

21:26.870 --> 21:28.780
from the bar association in there.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.920
We still have almost a week.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.900
Someone on the board
will hear about this,

21:32.910 --> 21:34.840
and they'll believe it because...

21:36.240 --> 21:38.100
... they heard it from a colleague.

21:38.110 --> 21:40.720
Yeah, I know. Word gets around, but...

21:40.880 --> 21:42.950
Try this on for size.

21:45.790 --> 21:48.550
Judge Papadoumian is in her chambers.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.450
She's working late.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.100
Everyone else has gone home.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.280
Suddenly, she smells something,

21:54.320 --> 21:56.420
something burning.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.080
She crosses to her door.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.730
It's warm to the touch.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.790
She opens it.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.590
Whoosh! Wall of flames.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.370
Her clerk's chamber's on fire.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.960
And she's trapped. But then,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.170
through the fire and smoke,

22:07.180 --> 22:10.040
a figure emerges. It's Jimmy McGill.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.760
See, I rescue a judge.

22:11.770 --> 22:14.380
Now, that, people are gonna talk about.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.610
And it's... it's too
big, and probably...

22:17.620 --> 22:20.680
it's not how I come
back from "insincere."

22:20.690 --> 22:22.680
Right.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.150
Okay.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.820
Wanna go back in, get
your money's worth?

22:28.830 --> 22:30.720
Yeah. I'm starving.

22:30.730 --> 22:34.090
Those little hamburgers
are looking good.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
I'm allowed to pay for the food,

22:37.410 --> 22:39.410
but I'm too sad to eat.

22:40.260 --> 22:44.740
Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.140
He is?

22:48.150 --> 22:49.470
You don't know if he's on the property

22:49.480 --> 22:51.110
at the moment?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.120
No.

22:52.140 --> 22:55.380
No, I don't need to
talk to him right now.

22:55.390 --> 22:57.310
No. No message.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.680
No. Thank you. You have a nice day.

26:09.210 --> 26:11.000
Get out of the way! Go!

26:11.010 --> 26:12.520
Sorry. It's just not working.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.240
- Excuse me.
- Hello?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.010
I'm at the north gate.

26:18.020 --> 26:19.550
And the machine is stuck.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.660
- At which gate?
- The north gate.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.320
All right, if everyone's ready.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.960
Folks, this is Duncan Springer.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.360
He's a senior from Mayfield High School

27:15.370 --> 27:16.570
in Las Cruces.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.100
Duncan, have a seat.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.130
Duncan's editor of the school newspaper,

27:20.140 --> 27:23.630
and his Model UN delegation
represents Kazakhstan.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.920
In fact, Duncan's
delegation was selected

27:26.940 --> 27:29.839
to visit the real UN in New York City.

27:29.840 --> 27:33.680
Duncan, what can you tell us about that?

27:33.780 --> 27:36.040
- Oh, it was...
- This is Marcie Ramirez.

27:36.060 --> 27:37.550
She's from Moriarty High.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.850
Please.

27:38.860 --> 27:41.580
She's captain of the debate team.

27:41.940 --> 27:44.220
What's your strategy gonna be, Marcie?

27:44.260 --> 27:46.460
- I think it'll...
- This is Franklyn Pickett.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.750
He's from Manzano High.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.060
Please have a seat.

27:49.070 --> 27:51.390
Franklyn is school president,

27:51.400 --> 27:53.540
and he wrote a play.

27:53.580 --> 27:56.880
Franklyn, what can you
tell us about your play?

27:56.940 --> 27:58.460
- It's...
- Teodora,

27:58.540 --> 28:00.519
how did you get interested in Ethiopia?

28:00.520 --> 28:01.680
- Well...
- Kristy,

28:01.700 --> 28:03.900
- what's it like working with elders?
- It was...

28:03.920 --> 28:05.939
Raymond, how'd you manage that?

28:05.940 --> 28:07.320
I've...

28:15.060 --> 28:16.420
All right.

28:16.430 --> 28:19.840
Things are becoming much clearer now.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.020
Can I let them go?

28:22.030 --> 28:24.090
- Uh, have they had lunch?
- Yes.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.240
Unless there's any additional questions?

28:26.320 --> 28:27.760
Oh, uh, did they all get the...

28:27.780 --> 28:29.200
- Yes, they did.
- Great.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.930
- Thank them again before leaving.
- Of course.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.620
Here's where we are...

28:32.680 --> 28:35.240
Raymond Chin six votes,

28:35.250 --> 28:37.020
Duncan Springer six votes,

28:37.040 --> 28:38.440
Marcie Ramirez five votes,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.520
Franklyn Pickett, Teodora Moon,

28:40.540 --> 28:42.180
and Tristram Bolger three votes each,

28:42.220 --> 28:44.910
and Kristy Esposito one vote.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.310
Well, looks like we have
three scholarships to give

28:47.340 --> 28:48.619
and three front runners.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.420
So, unless there's any disagreement,

28:50.430 --> 28:52.460
I think we can...

28:53.960 --> 28:55.780
Uh, Jimmy?

28:57.270 --> 28:59.060
Uh, yeah.

28:59.070 --> 29:02.990
Uh, the one vote for Kristy Esposito?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.060
That was me.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.700
And for what it's worth,

29:05.710 --> 29:08.270
I-I think we should
give her another look.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.970
Esposito?

29:09.980 --> 29:12.770
That's the shoplifter?

29:12.780 --> 29:14.940
The shoplifter.

29:14.950 --> 29:17.140
Ya... That's right.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.280
I mean, her grades are good.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.450
Maybe not quite as good as
some of the other kids,

29:22.460 --> 29:23.780
but they're good.

29:23.790 --> 29:26.320
And her recommendations are solid.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.880
And, yeah, she's had some trouble,

29:27.900 --> 29:29.860
but, um, she was new in town,

29:29.870 --> 29:31.290
and she made some bad choices.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.060
And that was sophomore year.

29:33.070 --> 29:35.490
She's had two really
strong years since then.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.900
And have you all read this?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.870
Her essay is...

29:39.880 --> 29:41.230
well, that experience

29:41.240 --> 29:43.000
is what got her interested in the law.

29:43.010 --> 29:44.640
And it's really good.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.370
It's really good.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.960
And my point is that

29:47.980 --> 29:50.140
maybe someone who's been in trouble,

29:50.150 --> 29:53.980
someone who doesn't
have a perfect record,

29:53.990 --> 29:57.720
you know, who's made mistakes
and faced the consequences...

29:57.780 --> 30:01.150
maybe she brings something
that the others don't.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.900
I think that deserves
real consideration.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.860
Jimmy, you make a hell of an argument.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.070
How about we take another vote?

30:18.880 --> 30:21.660
Kristy! Ms. Esposito, hold up!

30:21.740 --> 30:23.470
Hey. Jimmy McGill.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.500
Hi. We met inside.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.540
Oh. Hi.

30:26.580 --> 30:28.850
Hi.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.510
You didn't get it.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.550
You were never gonna get it.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.120
They...

30:36.130 --> 30:37.720
They dangle these
things in front of you.

30:37.730 --> 30:38.940
They tell you, you got a chance,

30:38.960 --> 30:41.690
but... I'm sorry... it's a lie

30:41.700 --> 30:43.290
because they had already
made up their mind

30:43.300 --> 30:44.420
and they knew what they were gonna do

30:44.440 --> 30:46.030
before you walked in the door.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.660
You made a mistake,

30:48.800 --> 30:51.740
and they are never forgetting it.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.300
As far as they're concerned,
your mistake is just...

30:55.310 --> 30:58.240
it's who you are, and it's all you are.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.440
And I'm not just talking
about the scholarship here.

31:00.460 --> 31:02.480
I'm talking about everything.

31:02.490 --> 31:03.799
I mean, they'll smile at you,

31:03.800 --> 31:04.876
they'll pat you on the head,

31:04.900 --> 31:09.150
but they are never, ever letting you in.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.890
But listen.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.220
Listen.

31:12.230 --> 31:13.860
It doesn't matter.

31:14.130 --> 31:16.460
It doesn't because you don't need them.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.630
They're not gonna give it to you?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.760
So what?

31:19.780 --> 31:21.260
You're gonna take it.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.230
You're gonna do whatever it takes.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.380
Do you hear me?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.230
You are not gonna play by the rules.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.360
You're gonna go your own way.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.920
You're gonna do what they won't do.

31:28.940 --> 31:29.940
You're gonna be smart.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.680
You are gonna cut corners,

31:31.760 --> 31:33.799
and you are gonna win.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.580
They're on the 35th floor?

31:35.590 --> 31:37.260
You're gonna be on the 50th floor.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.020
You're gonna be looking down on them.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.800
And the higher you rise,

31:40.930 --> 31:42.440
the more they're gonna hate you.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.280
Good. Good. You rub their noses in it.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.120
You make them suffer.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.300
You don't matter all that much to them.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.840
So what? So what?

31:52.300 --> 31:53.960
Screw them.

31:54.060 --> 31:58.500
Remember... the winner takes it all.

32:01.810 --> 32:04.340
I've gotta go get my bus.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.780
You... You understand what I'm
trying to tell you, right?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.720
Yes.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.650
I think I do.

32:14.780 --> 32:15.950
All right.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.690
All right, go get 'em.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.700
Damn it! Damn it! God damn it!

33:00.720 --> 33:03.000
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

33:15.390 --> 33:17.780
No.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.390
No.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.100
No. No.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.140
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

33:49.150 --> 33:50.970
Uh, my friend was here earlier,

33:50.980 --> 33:55.140
um, bald fellow, about so tall.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.660
Yeah. Did, uh, they find
his brother-in-law?

33:57.680 --> 33:58.690
Is he okay?

33:59.160 --> 34:01.480
No, no.

34:01.490 --> 34:03.890
No, we haven't found him yet.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.520
We're really worried.

34:05.530 --> 34:08.190
- I'm sorry to hear about that.
- Yeah.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.719
So, I was wondering if
there's maybe something

34:11.739 --> 34:14.040
that, you know, my friend missed.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.000
I showed him everything I've got.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.360
Show me what you showed him.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.600
Maybe you should just call your friend.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.480
I did, and, you know,

34:27.500 --> 34:28.938
he told me to come back
and take another look.

34:28.940 --> 34:31.679
I... I'd really appreciate it.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.580
I can't. I'm sorry.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.780
You better just call the police.

34:37.790 --> 34:40.060
Sure, sure.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.820
Travel Wire. This is Fred.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.279
Fourth street.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.420
Nearest cross street is Lomas.

34:51.679 --> 34:54.340
10:00 p.m. Yeah.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.860
Okay. Have a great day.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.200
Thank you.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.980
_

36:16.290 --> 36:18.450
Ahh.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.920
Is there a Mr. Ziegler here?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.540
Mr. Werner Ziegler?

36:26.580 --> 36:28.030
Oh, uh, yes.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.190
I am Ziegler.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.830
There's a call for you.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.330
Oh. Ja.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.260
Uh, uh... I will be right there.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.740
Thank you.

36:45.690 --> 36:47.980
_

36:48.290 --> 36:50.040
This is Werner?

36:50.690 --> 36:52.550
Yes.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.220
Who is this?

36:54.230 --> 36:57.040
I'm calling on behalf of Gustavo Fring.

37:00.430 --> 37:01.780
Ah, yes.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.430
I see.

37:03.580 --> 37:06.100
Is Mr. Fring very upset?

37:06.780 --> 37:08.300
What do you think?

37:08.310 --> 37:10.670
Please let him know the
work will continue.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.470
Did Michael show him my letter?

37:12.480 --> 37:14.900
I explained everything.

37:15.350 --> 37:19.140
Uh, no, Michael hasn't
shared that with Mr. Fring.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.140
The letter has specific instructions.

37:21.150 --> 37:23.600
My men will be able to
continue a few days

37:23.620 --> 37:24.880
without me.

37:24.890 --> 37:26.480
The work will go on.

37:26.490 --> 37:27.820
Ask Michael.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.190
Michael.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.380
Michael's very busy,

37:32.400 --> 37:34.190
and he asked me to speak with you.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.360
Do you remember what
your instructions were?

37:36.370 --> 37:37.370
Certainly.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.500
They are to finish clearing the debris,

37:39.540 --> 37:41.760
then begin the south wall.

37:41.770 --> 37:43.770
That's the south wall?

37:44.580 --> 37:47.400
The south wall, yes.

37:47.410 --> 37:48.840
The concrete is standing by.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.340
They can start pouring.

37:50.350 --> 37:52.040
It's very straightforward,

37:52.100 --> 37:53.920
so Kai will kno...

37:56.360 --> 37:57.660
The "concrete form"?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.450
Sorry. I didn't get that last part.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.280
Could you repeat that?

38:01.290 --> 38:02.430
Werner?

38:03.720 --> 38:05.130
Werner?

38:06.230 --> 38:07.930
Mr. Ziegler?

38:12.710 --> 38:14.640
Michael.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.470
Is that you?

38:24.550 --> 38:25.910
I'm so sorry if I...

38:25.920 --> 38:27.610
Get dressed.

38:27.620 --> 38:28.979
Michael...

38:28.980 --> 38:32.280
I don't wanna hear another
damn word out of you.

38:32.290 --> 38:34.140
Go.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.940
Hey.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.660
- Hey.
- I think I got something here.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.000
Take a look.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.930
The problem might have been
starting with "Remorse,"

39:08.940 --> 39:10.600
so I'm trying to work
into it more gradually.

39:10.610 --> 39:13.240
Uh, "The Law,"

39:13.250 --> 39:14.499
"Plans," then "Remorse,"

39:14.500 --> 39:15.580
then "Brother," then "Legacy."

39:15.600 --> 39:17.120
What do you think?

39:18.550 --> 39:20.250
Everything okay?

39:20.260 --> 39:21.910
Yeah.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.220
How'd it go?

39:24.230 --> 39:28.950
We gave three very bright
young people scholarships.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.039
Good.

39:30.040 --> 39:32.520
All right, we can work on this.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.060
I know it's a lot,

39:34.100 --> 39:36.830
but this is one time you
do not want to wing it.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.060
Yeah.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.000
Jimmy, the hard part's done.

39:42.010 --> 39:45.670
Reading room, scholarship, cemetery.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.370
By now, they've got to have
heard about some of it.

39:47.380 --> 39:48.610
We set up the dominoes,

39:48.620 --> 39:51.070
and now you just knock them down.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.480
I can say whatever I want.

39:54.490 --> 39:58.890
To the board, I'm still that guy.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.550
Well, you got to say something.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.490
What if, uh...

40:08.580 --> 40:10.600
What if, um...

40:24.580 --> 40:27.590
What if Chuck does the talking for me?

40:45.370 --> 40:47.640
Wait here.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.580
- Yes?
- I got him.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.380
Where are you now?

41:09.390 --> 41:12.460
Out by an old raceway off 55,

41:12.520 --> 41:15.200
about 8 miles north of San Ysidro.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.730
Where was he?

41:17.740 --> 41:19.880
A place called Dulce Vega Hot Springs

41:19.900 --> 41:21.160
up in Jemez.

41:21.220 --> 41:24.010
It's got to be where his wife is headed.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.020
Something else.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.700
Yes?

41:30.710 --> 41:32.659
When I found him, he was on the phone

41:32.660 --> 41:33.970
with an interested party

41:33.980 --> 41:36.200
pretending to be one of your guys.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.340
What did he tell them?

41:40.460 --> 41:42.550
Nothing useful.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.820
- You're certain?
- Yes.

41:45.830 --> 41:48.500
You have any idea who it was?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.160
I do.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.660
All right, I'll bring him in now.

41:54.670 --> 41:56.160
No.

41:56.170 --> 41:57.800
Keep him there.

41:57.910 --> 41:59.540
Wait.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.670
I'd go another way.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.280
That I know.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.080
That'd be a mistake.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.800
This discussion serves no purpose.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.450
Wait where you are.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.320
I'll take care of it.

42:31.610 --> 42:33.780
Are you sure?

42:35.440 --> 42:38.080
Yes.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.980
God damn it.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.280
Get out.

43:08.010 --> 43:10.220
I want to know what your end game was.

43:10.260 --> 43:12.640
What did you think was gonna happen?

43:13.150 --> 43:14.420
I thought I would come back

43:14.450 --> 43:17.910
and my friend Michael would
be very, very angry,

43:17.920 --> 43:19.240
but in time,

43:19.250 --> 43:21.310
he would understand and forgive.

43:21.420 --> 43:23.750
It was never up to me.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.750
Oh, Michael, look.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.850
I know I've made trouble for you,

43:27.860 --> 43:30.700
and I'm very sorry for
the damage I caused.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.940
I will repair what I
broke with my own hands,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.940
but, please, Margarethe
will land any minute.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.580
Soon, she will be at the motel.

43:37.620 --> 43:40.320
Please take me back there.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.870
Let us be together for a little, huh?

43:42.880 --> 43:46.440
Let her see me and know
everything is okay.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.200
Ah, please, Michael.

43:49.220 --> 43:50.740
I go back now,

43:50.760 --> 43:51.980
I go back in the morning...

43:51.990 --> 43:54.480
what difference can it make?

43:55.440 --> 43:57.860
It's not gonna happen.

44:00.630 --> 44:02.050
Let me speak to Mr. Fring.

44:02.060 --> 44:04.060
I will explain everything.

44:04.070 --> 44:05.880
I will make him understand.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.690
You're not gonna talk to Fring.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.720
Oh, please. I know if I...

44:09.740 --> 44:12.400
Werner, nothing you can say or do

44:12.440 --> 44:15.910
will make anyone trust you again.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.460
I will go home.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.780
I will never breathe
a word of this ever.

44:39.370 --> 44:44.700
The money... I give all of it back.

44:46.270 --> 44:47.560
I will tell no one.

44:47.570 --> 44:49.400
I s-swear.

44:49.600 --> 44:55.080
It will be as if none
of this ever happened.

44:56.680 --> 44:57.940
Please, Michael.

44:57.950 --> 45:00.610
You know I will keep silent.

45:00.620 --> 45:02.080
You know it. Please.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.950
Does your wife have a
cellphone with her?

45:05.960 --> 45:07.880
Yes.

45:07.890 --> 45:10.850
I need you to call her now.

45:10.860 --> 45:12.320
She landed an hour ago.

45:12.350 --> 45:13.880
But she knows nothing.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.980
And you need to keep it that way.

45:16.100 --> 45:17.890
She's being followed.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.930
She's followed?

45:20.940 --> 45:22.480
She goes back to the airport,

45:22.490 --> 45:24.230
nothing will happen to her.

45:24.240 --> 45:27.540
Surely they could not...
they would not...

45:27.550 --> 45:29.140
Hey, pull yourself together.

45:29.150 --> 45:30.740
Give me the phone. I call her now.

45:30.780 --> 45:31.900
- Calm... Calm Dow...
- Give it to me.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.380
Calm down!

45:33.390 --> 45:34.980
She can't suspect.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.900
It doesn't matter what you tell her,

45:36.920 --> 45:39.590
as long as she goes
back where she belongs.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.830
_

45:57.840 --> 45:59.800
Hello. Ja.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.440
_

46:02.500 --> 46:05.580
_

46:05.640 --> 46:07.980
_

46:08.700 --> 46:10.760
_

46:10.980 --> 46:13.300
_

46:13.560 --> 46:15.700
_

46:15.840 --> 46:18.320
_

46:19.260 --> 46:22.760
_

46:22.940 --> 46:25.420
_

46:25.480 --> 46:27.240
_

46:28.040 --> 46:31.920
_

46:31.960 --> 46:34.700
_

46:38.720 --> 46:41.000
_

46:41.520 --> 46:43.580
_

46:43.940 --> 46:45.560
_

46:45.620 --> 46:48.040
_

46:49.520 --> 46:50.900
_

46:50.940 --> 46:53.240
_

46:53.420 --> 46:55.620
_

46:55.660 --> 46:57.080
_

46:57.150 --> 47:00.780
_

47:13.850 --> 47:15.750
Will she do it?

47:18.280 --> 47:19.900
She was very angry,

47:19.920 --> 47:22.790
but, yes, she will go home.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.660
Michael...

47:29.370 --> 47:31.180
if she does not hear a word from me,

47:31.220 --> 47:33.400
she will ask questions.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.660
She will go to the police.

47:36.670 --> 47:40.500
There will be a story, an accident.

47:41.260 --> 47:43.870
Lawyers will visit, German lawyers.

47:46.380 --> 47:49.940
Her questions will be answered.

47:49.950 --> 47:51.980
This you swear?

47:53.590 --> 47:56.580
This I swear.

47:56.590 --> 47:58.420
And my men?

47:59.560 --> 48:01.220
They're going home.

48:01.230 --> 48:03.200
They'll be okay. They're trusted.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.870
Is there no other way, truly?

48:38.700 --> 48:42.840
There are so many stars
visible in New Mexico.

48:48.780 --> 48:52.020
I will walk out there...

48:52.700 --> 48:55.350
to get a better look.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.590
Wow.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.600
I mean...

50:02.600 --> 50:04.880
it's incredible.

50:04.910 --> 50:06.830
I feel like we've been
talking about this forever,

50:06.840 --> 50:10.270
and now...

50:10.280 --> 50:12.060
here it is.

50:14.780 --> 50:17.440
An architectural feat.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.910
Truly.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.490
Herculean.

50:25.330 --> 50:26.890
This is...

50:31.470 --> 50:33.030
This is...

50:34.660 --> 50:36.960
Yeah!

50:38.170 --> 50:40.320
I can work with this.

50:41.710 --> 50:46.080
I mean, it's not exactly
what we talked about,

50:46.120 --> 50:48.810
but it has possibilities,
even unfinished.

50:48.820 --> 50:52.440
Uh, ventilation at this
point is the main hurdle,

50:52.450 --> 50:54.750
but with a series of fans
and the right equipment,

50:54.780 --> 50:57.280
I am certain that I could
do a rudimentary cook

50:57.290 --> 50:58.520
at the very least.

50:58.530 --> 51:01.660
Not until it is ready.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.390
Oh.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.000
Um, of course.

51:07.730 --> 51:10.730
We only want to do it
if it's done right.

51:10.740 --> 51:15.440
I was just... exploring possibilities.

51:18.480 --> 51:24.760
I am gonna go up and check the...

51:26.150 --> 51:27.590
Okay.

51:38.900 --> 51:40.880
Oh. Hello.

52:21.370 --> 52:22.600
Of course.

52:22.610 --> 52:24.420
That won't be a problem.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.400
Where do you have it?

52:33.490 --> 52:34.940
Okay.

52:34.950 --> 52:36.380
This should do it.

52:36.390 --> 52:38.280
Chuck wrote a good letter, huh?

52:38.360 --> 52:39.920
Chuck wrote a great letter.

52:43.330 --> 52:46.540
It's not just the words,
though, you know?

52:47.570 --> 52:49.440
It's how you read them.

52:58.510 --> 53:01.660
Jimmy, whatever happens in there...

53:02.480 --> 53:04.340
I'm with you.

53:07.980 --> 53:10.340
Mr. McGill, we've
reviewed all the facts,

53:10.350 --> 53:12.120
the same facts as the hearing committee.

53:12.180 --> 53:13.900
We've evaluated their findings.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.820
All that's left is for us to hear

53:15.840 --> 53:16.950
your prepared statement.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.490
So, whenever you're ready.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.860
Thank you, Your Honor.

53:20.920 --> 53:23.320
I-I don't have a prepared statement.

53:23.330 --> 53:27.330
But I do have this.

53:27.340 --> 53:29.760
Um, it's a letter

53:29.980 --> 53:32.430
from my brother, Charles McGill.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.300
He left it to me in his will,

53:35.310 --> 53:39.180
and I received it last
year after he passed.

53:45.660 --> 53:47.610
"Dear Jimmy,

53:47.620 --> 53:49.620
I have left many things unsaid

53:49.630 --> 53:51.920
in our relationship through the years.

53:51.980 --> 53:52.990
Rather than allow

53:53.000 --> 53:55.200
these unspoken thoughts to die with me,

53:55.280 --> 53:57.720
I've chosen to record them here for you.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.330
I hope you will take my words

53:59.340 --> 54:02.000
in the spirit in which
they are intended.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.620
I remember quite clearly

54:08.640 --> 54:10.970
the day you came home from the hospital.

54:10.980 --> 54:14.140
You can't imagine the joy on Mom's face.

54:14.150 --> 54:17.750
I can honestly say I
never saw her happier."

54:32.540 --> 54:35.360
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

54:37.170 --> 54:38.480
I was...

54:39.700 --> 54:42.070
I was just gonna try to...

54:42.080 --> 54:44.020
I was gonna try to move you all

54:44.060 --> 54:46.720
with my brother's eloquent words,

54:46.780 --> 54:48.780
you know, pull on your heartstrings,

54:48.800 --> 54:50.820
but it's not right.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.080
This letter's between me and him,

54:53.290 --> 54:55.620
and it should stay that way.

54:58.440 --> 55:01.639
Listen, my brother, Chuck...

55:01.640 --> 55:04.760
you... you knew him.

55:04.770 --> 55:08.720
He loved me in his own way.

55:08.900 --> 55:10.900
He loved me as a brother.

55:12.570 --> 55:15.000
He did not love me as a lawyer.

55:16.410 --> 55:18.740
Big reason I became a lawyer was Chuck.

55:18.820 --> 55:22.610
He was the most brilliant
man I ever knew.

55:22.620 --> 55:24.610
And an incredible lawyer.

55:24.620 --> 55:25.860
You know?

55:25.940 --> 55:29.800
And, uh, he knew exactly
who he was... exactly.

55:31.130 --> 55:34.600
And all my life, I wanted
to make him proud.

55:35.460 --> 55:40.900
And he was not an easy man
to make proud, you know?

55:40.940 --> 55:44.430
Like climbing Everest without supplies.

55:44.440 --> 55:47.600
If you were one of the lucky
few who reached that peak,

55:47.640 --> 55:50.220
even for a moment, if
you made him proud,

55:50.380 --> 55:53.340
wow, what a feeling.

55:53.400 --> 55:54.440
Whew.

55:54.460 --> 55:56.980
And he let you know it, too.

55:57.160 --> 55:59.960
But if you weren't one
of those people...

56:01.290 --> 56:03.160
he was polite enough,

56:03.240 --> 56:06.020
but he did not suffer fools, you know?

56:06.030 --> 56:10.020
And he could be
judgmental and difficult.

56:10.030 --> 56:12.640
And he knew how to get under your skin.

56:12.740 --> 56:17.160
And... could be a real son of a bitch.

56:18.200 --> 56:21.270
Chuck was the one who
was always right...

56:21.280 --> 56:23.400
always.

56:23.880 --> 56:26.140
And usually he was.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.340
You know?

56:27.350 --> 56:29.170
So, for a guy like me...

56:31.120 --> 56:32.740
I did lousy in school.

56:32.790 --> 56:34.330
I lacked ambition.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.600
I always cut corners. I mean, for me

56:36.720 --> 56:40.840
to live up to the standards
of Charles McGill...

56:45.870 --> 56:48.290
I mean, look at me.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.560
I'll never be as moral as him.

56:50.570 --> 56:52.460
I'll never be as smart.

56:52.470 --> 56:54.460
I'll never be as respected.

56:56.080 --> 57:00.740
I'll never be as good as Chuck.

57:04.220 --> 57:05.910
But I can try.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.680
I can try.

57:08.690 --> 57:13.760
If you decide, and I
get to be a lawyer...

57:16.160 --> 57:18.090
... I'll do everything in my power

57:18.100 --> 57:20.800
to be worthy of the name McGill.

57:23.770 --> 57:26.920
And if you decide I'm not a lawyer...

57:29.940 --> 57:32.400
... doesn't matter.

57:32.410 --> 57:36.610
I'll still try to be the
best man that I can be.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.080
I'm lucky.

57:43.090 --> 57:44.960
I got this letter.

57:45.690 --> 57:48.420
I never had a chance
to write him a letter

57:48.430 --> 57:51.580
and to tell him all the
things that I should have.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.960
And I got to believe that somehow...

57:57.040 --> 57:59.240
... somehow he knows.

58:04.760 --> 58:07.260
Oh, that's...

58:07.280 --> 58:09.200
That'll have to do it for me.

58:09.860 --> 58:11.900
Sorry.

58:12.580 --> 58:14.150
Thank you.

58:23.280 --> 58:25.339
I knew you could do it! I
knew you had it in you.

58:25.340 --> 58:27.380
- That was so great.
- I mean, yes. They...

58:27.390 --> 58:28.800
They have to reinstate you, right?

58:28.820 --> 58:30.890
- They just have to.
- Uh, yeah. Did you see those suckers?

58:30.900 --> 58:32.399
That one asshole was crying.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.559
He had actual tears!

58:33.560 --> 58:35.060
Jesus, Kim!

58:35.070 --> 58:36.820
Listen, I started reading the letter,

58:36.860 --> 58:38.900
and I just knew it wasn't...

58:38.960 --> 58:40.200
I could tell by their faces

58:40.220 --> 58:41.540
it wasn't gonna be enough, right?

58:41.600 --> 58:44.880
So I just went off on
this flow, you know?

58:44.900 --> 58:46.259
I had this energy going through me.

58:46.260 --> 58:48.360
It was like improv or jazz, and then...

58:48.420 --> 58:50.800
boom! I sunk the hook in!

58:51.600 --> 58:54.500
I am so lucky I have this letter.

58:54.580 --> 58:57.180
God, I could see the Matrix, you know?

58:57.190 --> 58:58.480
I was invincible.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.120
I could dodge bullets, baby.

59:00.160 --> 59:01.980
And you were right. You were right.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.100
It was all about Chuck the whole time.

59:04.140 --> 59:06.530
Oh, Mr. McGill, you're still here.

59:06.540 --> 59:07.540
There's some good news.

59:07.550 --> 59:10.330
- Believe me, I already know.
- Oh, good.

59:10.340 --> 59:11.700
Then if you want to come
with me to the office,

59:11.710 --> 59:13.030
there's some paperwork for you to sign.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.400
Absolutely. Let's do this thing.

59:15.420 --> 59:16.680
Oh, and, sweetheart,

59:16.690 --> 59:19.700
I'm gonna need one more form... a DBA...

59:19.800 --> 59:21.510
because I'm not gonna be practicing

59:21.540 --> 59:23.510
under the name McGill, so...

59:23.520 --> 59:24.700
Shouldn't be a problem.

59:24.740 --> 59:26.146
Just down the hall, we
have all the forms.

59:26.170 --> 59:27.840
- Great. Great.
- Wait. Wh... Wait.

59:27.880 --> 59:29.320
Jimmy, Jimmy, what?

59:29.330 --> 59:31.860
S'all good, man.
