FORCE THEIR PARENTS TO BUY THEM.

YOU GOT TO SEE THIS.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.368
YOU MADE A GREAT
EVENT TODAY, HON.

FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.171
I'M ALREADY
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.174
WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF?

01:49.510 --> 01:52.180
THAT WASN'T WHAT I MEANT.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.903
PEOPLE ARE GONNA TALK.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.874
WELL, THAT'S WHY I PLAN
ON DOING SOME TALKING FIRST.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.377
I WANT US TO FORMERLY
REPORT OUR RELATIONSHIP

02:56.410 --> 02:58.279
TO HUMAN RESOURCES.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.782
OKAY. YOU GET THEM,
I'LL COVER EVERYBODY ELSE.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.417
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

03:03.451 --> 03:05.519
IF WE COULD KEEP IT QUIET
UNTIL WE HAD THAT MEETING.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.521
IT'S GONNA BE HARD WITH ME
GRABBING YOUR ASS ALL DAY.

HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?

03:33.947 --> 03:37.017

ABOUT A CASE FOR YOU.

HER HEART STOPPED--

03:39.887 --> 03:41.021
SOUNDS GREAT.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.357
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.593
I SENSE SOMETHING
FASCINATING ABOUT IT.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.928
I'M GONNA GET US IN
TO SEE HR THIS AFTERNOON.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.663
THINK YOU CAN HOLD
YOUR TONGUE TILL THEN?

03:49.697 --> 03:52.933

03:52.966 --> 03:53.734
FINE.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.536

SOON ENOUGH.

I'M SEEING CUDDY.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.821
GENERALLY,
WITHOUT HER CLOTHES ON.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.956
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.991
HOPE IT'S GOT
A WIDE-ANGLE LENS.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.927
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THAT.

SCIENCE CLUBBER,
SEAL CLUBBER.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.948
I'M ACTUALLY GUESSING
WITH THAT LAST ONE.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.016
HEALTHY ONE DAY,
HEART ARRHYTHMIA THE NEXT.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.418
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

04:44.452 --> 04:46.920
TO BE YANKING
ON THE CHAIN OF COMMAND?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.622
WAY TO GO, HOUSE.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.991
I'M SURPRISED YOU TWO
DIDN'T GET TOGETHER SOONER.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.726

ARE ALL SPOTLESS.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.528

04:55.963 --> 04:58.098
IN FAVOR, INDIGNANT,
INDIFFERENT.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.000
THINK I'D LIKE
A FEMALE PERSPECTIVE.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.837
OR THIRTEEN'S.
WHERE IS SHE?
SHE'S GONE.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.673

05:05.706 --> 05:08.509

A HUNTINGTON'S STUDY IN ROME.

THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF HER.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.978

ARE DISCONNECTED.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.614

BEEN VACATED.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.916
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE DEATH'S HEAD CANE?

05:15.949 --> 05:20.521
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A DEATH'S ASS CANE IN MY SIZE.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.990
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.393
CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE
INTERMITTENT HEART ARRHYTHMIAS.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.727

05:26.760 --> 05:28.095
THREE YEARS, YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO GAME OUT THIRTEEN,

05:28.128 --> 05:29.530
AND NOW YOU DON'T CARE?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.732
SORRY.
NOT CARING ABOUT THIRTEEN

05:31.765 --> 05:33.734
IS NOT PART OF THE DIFFERENTIAL
FOR HEART ARRHYTHMIA,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
BUT YOU DO GET
A HOME VERSION OF THE GAME.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.404
PATIENT'S BROTHER HAS SEVERE,

05:36.437 --> 05:37.738
CONGENITAL
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.640

OF ABOUT 25.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.475
IF SHE'S HAD
A LATENT CASE OF IT...

05:41.509 --> 05:43.411
WOULDN'T BE SUDDEN ONSET.
FOREMAN.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.813
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIRTEEN THAT WE DON'T?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.381
SHE'S ENTITLED
TO HER PRIVACY.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.583
JUST AS I'M ENTITLED
TO A DIAGNOSIS.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.052
AND YOU'RE GLOSSING OVER
THIRTEEN'S DEPARTURE

05:52.085 --> 05:55.489
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY RESPECT
SOMEBODY'S PRIVACY?

05:55.523 --> 05:56.924
I AGREE. IT'S WEIRD OF ME
NOT TO CARE.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.059
SO EITHER I'M A CHANGED MAN
BECAUSE OF CUDDY,

05:59.092 --> 06:00.694
OR I'M PRETENDING
TO BE A CHANGED MAN

06:00.728 --> 06:02.430
BECAUSE I DO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIRTEEN

06:02.463 --> 06:04.064
AND I'M TRYING
TO THROW YOU OFF THE SCENT,

06:04.097 --> 06:05.966
OR I'VE JUST GONE NUTTY BANANAS
BECAUSE I LOST A PATIENT.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.000
ALL OF WHICH
YOU ARE FREE TO DISCUSS

06:07.034 --> 06:09.670
AFTER I GET A DIAGNOSIS.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.838
IF IT'S LONG QT SYNDROME,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.139
ANY STARTLING STIMULUS
IN THAT SKATE PARK

06:12.172 --> 06:13.674
COULD HAVE TRIGGERED
THE ARRHYTHMIA.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.476
LOUD NOISE,
FLASHING LIGHTS.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.845
SCARE THE PATIENT TO DEATH
TO CONFIRM LONG QT.

06:20.981 --> 06:21.949
FINE.
IF YOU INSIST,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.884
DO IT IN A ROOM WITH ONE
OF THOSE THINGAMABOBS

06:23.917 --> 06:27.621
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE
BACK TO LIFE.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.622
SCARE TEST IS INSANE.

06:28.656 --> 06:29.623
SCARE TEST IS LEGITIMATE.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.024
SIMULATES REAL WORLD
CONDITIONS.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.893
THIS FLING WITH CUDDY
IS INSANE.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.628
FLARE GUN?
SCARY ENOUGH?

06:34.662 --> 06:36.930
HOW ABOUT JUST TELLING HER
WE'RE PLANNING THIS STUPID TEST?

06:36.964 --> 06:39.166
AND I'M HOPING HOUSE AND CUDDY
ARE MORE THAN JUST A FLING.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.501
IT'S CLEARLY
MELLOWED HIM OUT.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.002
HE DIDN'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT THIRTEEN.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.036
RIGHT.
THE GUY WHO ORDERED US

06:43.070 --> 06:44.972
TO STOP THE PATIENT'S HEART
HAS MELLOWED OUT.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.840
IT'S GONNA BE HORRIBLE
BECAUSE IT'S DOOMED,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.008
WHICH IS JUST
GONNA MAKE HOUSE

06:48.041 --> 06:49.577
50 TIMES MORE
OF A CRANK.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.944
FIRECRACKERS.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.514
WE CAN HIDE 'EM UNDER ONE
OF THOSE COVERED FOOD TRAYS.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.154
FIND ANY ITCHING POWDER
IN YOUR HANKY?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.624
ANY FAKE POO
IN YOUR DESK DRAWER?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.192
YES, THE LACK
OF DIME-STORE PRANKS

07:05.225 --> 07:07.928
IS PROOF THAT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY DATING CUDDY,

07:07.961 --> 07:09.062
AND NOT JUST MOCKING ME

07:09.096 --> 07:10.831
FOR BEING WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.500
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO PROVE THIS TO YOU?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.568
TATTOO A CANE
ON HER INNER THIGH?

07:14.602 --> 07:17.571
TATTOO HER INNER THIGH
ON MY CANE?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.773
YOU TOLD EVERYBODY,
DIDN'T YOU?

07:19.807 --> 07:20.774
REPEATEDLY.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.042
THIS ONE'S NOT BUYING IT.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.076
NEED A LITTLE HELP.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.111
I'M NOT SELLING IT.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.714
IT'S TIME FOR OUR MEETING
AT HUMAN RESOURCES.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.682
HMM.
HUMAN RESOURCES.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.984
NOW, WHY WOULD I NEED
TO GO TO HUMAN RESOURCES?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.553
HOUSE, YOU'VE BEEN
TO HUMAN RESOURCES

07:32.586 --> 07:34.722
74 TIMES
IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.791
NEVER AFTER DOING THIS.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.159
WELL, I'M CONVINCED.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.061
COME ON.
ONE PECK.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.262
JUST ENOUGH
TO AROUSE HIM A LITTLE.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.097
I--HEY, I'M NOT EVEN...

07:44.131 --> 07:45.566
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.801
IF I CONFIRM IT,
CAN WE LEAVE?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.603
YES.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.772
IT'S TRUE.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.210
I'VE BEEN MORE PASSIONATE

07:57.244 --> 07:58.579
WITH MY GREAT AUNT.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.814
MABEL? UP HIGH.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.159
WE DONE HERE?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.068
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
ASK ME TO COUGH.

08:21.101 --> 08:26.239
THINK YOU STRAIGHTENED OUT
MY LIMP A LITTLE.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.875
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

08:27.908 --> 08:30.811
THE EXACT NATURE
OF THE RELATIONSHIP?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.145
YOU EVER SEE
WILD KINGDOM?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.147
THOSE INSECTS THAT RIP
THEIR PARTNER'S HEADS OFF

08:34.181 --> 08:36.717
AFTER COPULATING?

08:44.157 --> 08:45.959
IT'S A SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.730
GO SLOWLY NOW.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.964
HE'S WRITING IT DOWN.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.767
I BELIEVE
THAT I CAN STILL

08:53.801 --> 08:55.869
SUPERVISE DR. HOUSE
EFFECTIVELY,

08:55.903 --> 08:57.671
BUT WE BOTH WANT
TO FOLLOW HOSPITAL POLICY

08:57.705 --> 08:58.672
TO THE LETTER.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.173
OUR CONCERN
IS TO MAKE SURE

09:00.207 --> 09:02.209
THAT THERE'S NO
CONFLICT OF INTEREST,

09:02.242 --> 09:04.845
NO LIABILITY
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.714
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA SUE
IF THINGS GO SOUTH?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.348
LET ME TELL YOU.
SHE ACTUALLY DOES GO--

09:08.381 --> 09:10.618
HOUSE.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.252
LET HIM TALK.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.623
I, UH, KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SUE,

09:15.656 --> 09:20.093
BECAUSE YOU ARE BOTH
GOING TO SIGN LOVE CONTRACTS.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.162
CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP
AGREEMENTS.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.197
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
OUTSIDE COUNCIL

09:24.231 --> 09:29.102
WILL HAVE TO REVIEW
THE CROTCHLESS UNDIES CLAUSE.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.271
UH, WE'LL ALSO NEED TO WATCH

09:31.304 --> 09:33.974
FOR ANY FAVORITISM
TOWARD DR. HOUSE.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.776
DOES THAT MEAN SHE HAS
TO SLEEP WITH EVERYONE?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.711
I PROMISE NOT TO GIVE HIM
A RAISE OR A PROMOTION

09:37.745 --> 09:38.912
OF ANY KIND.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.013
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A JOKE THERE

09:40.047 --> 09:41.314
ABOUT KEEPING UP
WITH INFLATION.

09:41.348 --> 09:45.619
OR BIAS AGAINST HIM.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.922
ARE THERE ANY
SUPERVISORY ISSUES

09:48.956 --> 09:50.157
WITH DR. HOUSE'S
CURRENT CASE LOAD?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.725
NO, HER CASE IS SOLVED.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.226
PATIENT HAS LONG QT.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
GONNA SCARE HER INTO
CARDIAC ARREST TO CONFIRM IT.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.396
NO, WE'RE NOT.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.299
OKAY, NO, WE'RE NOT.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.671
SEE?
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.206
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL PLANNING
YOUR RIDICULOUS SCARE TEST.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.208
THE PATIENT IS NOWHERE
NEAR SICK ENOUGH

10:08.241 --> 10:10.077
TO JUSTIFY THE RISK.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.045
AN ANGIOGRAM
AND AN E.P. STUDY

10:12.079 --> 10:14.748
ARE MUCH SAFER
AND VERY EFFECTIVE.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.918
FAIR POINT.
NOT DOING THE SCARE TEST.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.156
I'D INVITE YOU TO WATCH ME
NOT DOING THE TEST,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.192
BUT HAVING NOT DONE IT
MANY TIMES BEFORE,

10:25.225 --> 10:27.895
TRUST ME, IT'S PRETTY
NOT INTERESTING.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.302
[phone beeps, dials]

10:35.335 --> 10:36.303
(Taub)
HOUSE?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.104
SCARE TEST
WAS NOT APPROVED.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.272
DO AN ANGIO AND
E.P. STUDY INSTEAD.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.742
FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S NOT
AS EFFECTIVE AS--

10:44.845 --> 10:47.047
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DOING
THE MORE SPECIALIZED TEST?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.449
THIS TEST IS VIRTUALLY
JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.352
AND DR. HOUSE PUTS
A PREMIUM ON PATIENT SAFETY.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.721
BUT FREQUENTLY
CHANGES HIS MIND.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.757
HUGO, GIVE HIM A BREAK.
I'M FINE.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.058
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE BATHROOM
BEFORE WE GO.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.060
WE'VE BEEN HYDRATING YOU
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.194
I DON'T HAVE TO PEE.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.863
ONCE WE START THE TEST,

11:02.896 --> 11:04.732
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.366
I REALLY DON'T HAVE TO PEE.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.936
HOW MUCH FLUID
HAVE WE GIVEN HER?

11:10.403 --> 11:11.839
2.5 LITERS.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.440
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.876
LAST NIGHT, I GUESS.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.144
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:17.177 --> 11:20.047
YOUR DAUGHTER'S KIDNEYS
SEEM TO BE FAILING.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.188
SO WHAT COULD CAUSE
HER HEART TO STOP

11:28.221 --> 11:30.290
AND HER URINE NOT TO DROP?

11:30.323 --> 11:34.061
HOUSE, I WAS EXPECTING
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUDDY

11:34.094 --> 11:36.296
TO COMPLICATE OUR WORK
LONG-TERM.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.166
I AM NOW CONCERNED IT MIGHT
BE AFFECTING US SHORT-TERM.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.300
ALL DUE RESPECT.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.902
NONE TAKEN.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.837
I LISTEN TO CUDDY
ALL THE TIME.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.339
SHE'S MY BOSS.
ALSO YOURS, BY THE WAY.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.941
YOU'D LISTEN, THEN TELL HER
SHE'S BEING AN IDIOT,

11:47.975 --> 11:49.242
AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.243
I FIND I CAN SKIP
THE IDIOT PART

11:50.277 --> 11:51.779
WHEN SHE'S NOT
BEING AN IDIOT,

11:51.812 --> 11:52.980
AND SINCE THE SCARE TEST

11:53.013 --> 11:54.381
WOULD HAVE LED
TO THE SAME DEAD END,

11:54.414 --> 11:55.916
SHE WAS RIGHT TO STOP IT.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.351
WHICH MEANS
YOUR PROBLEM'S ABOUT YOU.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.787
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.221
LOSERS LOVE COMPANY.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.824
AND IF EVEN
A MISANTHROPE LIKE ME

12:03.857 --> 12:05.358
HAS A CHANCE AT HAPPINESS,

12:05.392 --> 12:06.827
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY LONELY

12:06.860 --> 12:08.762
ON THAT LANDFILL
OF LOSERDOM

12:08.796 --> 12:10.898
YOU CALL A MARRIAGE.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.199
HEART, KIDNEYS, GO.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.234
COULD BE FABRY DISEASE.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.969
LIPID DEPOSITION
IN HER TISSUES.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.137
DAD'S HISTORY WAS CLEAN.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.338
WHAT ABOUT
PROTEIN DEPOSITS?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.373
THEY WOULDN'T SHOW
IN HER PARENTS' HISTORY.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.242
AMYLOIDOSIS.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.277
EXPLAINS BOTH
THE SYMPTOMS.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.779
MARROW TRANSPLANT
TO TREAT.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.314
BROTHER'S A MATCH.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.083
CONFIRM AND DO.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.787
I BEEN
EXPERIENCING FATIGUE,

12:33.821 --> 12:36.289
AND--AND WEAKNESS.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.925
WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE FACT

12:37.958 --> 12:41.294
THAT YOU'RE...
102 YEARS OLD.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.096
USUALLY
HE'S STRONG AS AN OX.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.865
102-YEAR-OLD OX.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.334
HE HAS TINGLING
IN HIS FEET AND HIS LEGS.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.569
I WANT A FULL BATTERY
OF TESTS.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.971
CARBON DATING?

12:51.004 --> 12:53.373
I'LL PAY CASH
IF IT'S NOT COVERED.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.008
THAT'S NICE OF YOU
TO FLOAT YOUR FRIEND.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.210
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
HE'S MY FATHER.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.113
HE'S 22 YEARS
OLDER THAN ME.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.183
WELL, THAT'S TRUE, HE'S
DEFINITELY HAD HIS JOWLS DONE.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.485
STATISTICALLY, IF HE DIDN'T
HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.354
HE'D BE LIKE MOST
PEOPLE OF HIS AGE--

13:07.387 --> 13:09.356
DEAD FOR THE PAST
SEVERAL DECADES.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.924
DO THE TESTS.
I'M SICK.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.426
YOU HAVE A BAD CASE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.430
DO THE DAMN TESTS.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.266
IF THE VIAL
FILLS WITH SAND,

13:19.299 --> 13:22.535
WE TAKE THAT AS A BAD SIGN.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.603
HUGO SHOULD BE HERE.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.537
WHY'D YOU ASK HIM TO LEAVE?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.107
WE WANTED TO BE ABLE
TO DISCUSS THIS OPENLY.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.042
BUT IT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS HIM.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.410
HONEY,
LET THE DOCTOR FINISH.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.912
IT'S A STANDARD PROCEDURE.

13:31.945 --> 13:32.980
WE USE GENERAL ANESTHESIA,

13:33.013 --> 13:34.347
HARVEST A VERY SMALL
AMOUNT OF--

13:34.381 --> 13:37.150
NO. I'M NOT TAKING
MY BROTHER'S MARROW.

13:37.184 --> 13:37.951
DEL, IT'S--

13:37.985 --> 13:39.286
THESE HARVESTS
ARE HARMLESS.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.387
WITH THE MEDS WE GIVE,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.055
THERE'S ALMOST NO PAIN,

13:42.089 --> 13:43.156
ALMOST NO RISK OF INFECTION.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.258
ALMOST?

13:45.292 --> 13:49.462
HIS LIFE'S HARD ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.364
(Taub)
SMALL PROBLEM
WITH THE TREATMENT.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.902
PATIENT WON'T TAKE MARROW
FROM STEEL WHEELS?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.303
WE'RE FINDING
ANOTHER MATCH.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.337
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.439
WHAT OTHER PROBLEM
COULD THERE BE

13:59.472 --> 14:01.074
WITH A PROBLEM-FREE
PROCEDURE?

14:01.108 --> 14:03.310
BOY'S SPORTS,
SCIENCE CLUB,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.412
SHE'S LIVING HIS LIFE,
NOT HERS.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.547
MAKES SENSE SHE'S BEING
A SELF-DENYING MORON.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.548
SHE LOVES HER BROTHER.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.017
SHE'S THINKING
SELFLESSLY.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.018
HOW IS THAT AT ALL--

14:11.051 --> 14:12.019
BEING MORONIC?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.253
MM.
IF I CAN ONLY THINK

14:13.286 --> 14:14.354
OF A HARM-FREE
MEDICAL TREATMENT

14:14.387 --> 14:15.355
SHE TURNED DOWN LATELY.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.356
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.524
IF EVERYONE
WERE MORE SELFISH,

14:17.557 --> 14:19.059
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A BETTER PLACE.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.428
SEE? I CAN SKIP
THE IDIOT PART

14:21.461 --> 14:24.597
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
BEING AN IDIOT.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.267
YEAH, I HAD THAT
SAME FACIAL EXPRESSION

14:27.300 --> 14:28.368
FOR THE FIRST 48 HOURS.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.536
HAD ANOTHER ONE TOO,

14:29.569 --> 14:32.205
BUT ONLY FOR
15 SECONDS AT A TIME.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.573
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
YOU'RE HAPPY FOR YOU.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.475
THIS IS HUGE.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.610
SO WHO'S GONNA
SUPERVISE YOU?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.412
CUDDY.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.015
WELL, I GUESS
MAYBE THAT CAN WORK.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.351
MAYBE?
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.487
YOU SHOWED UP FOR CLINIC HOURS.
VOLUNTARILY.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.057
FINE.
A LITTLE BIT HAS CHANGED.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.224
HOUSE,
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.425
YOU'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.493
YOU WANT SOMETHING FROM HER

14:53.526 --> 14:56.629
BESIDES A SIGN-OFF ON SCARING
YOUR PATIENT TO DEATH.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.131
YOU TALKED TO TAUB.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.499
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.500
HE'S A JERK.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.035
I'M WORRIED TOO.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.036
DO I NEED TO SAY IT?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.938
I WANT THIS TO WORK.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.974
I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.376
SHE CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT ONE DIAGNOSTIC TEST.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.311
AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOUR
EMOTIONAL DEFAULT,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.448
STOP WORRYING.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.519
I CAN HANDLE IT.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.955
I HEAR YOU'RE A PRETTY
FIERCE SKATEBOARDER.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.057
I DO OKAY.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.225
ALL YOUR ACTIVITIES,

15:25.258 --> 15:28.061
DON'T THEY SEEM LIKE THINGS

15:28.095 --> 15:30.230
A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY
WOULD DO?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.299
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK

15:32.332 --> 15:34.467
YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE
HIS LIFE FOR HIM.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.071
I AM. SORT OF.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.172
UM,
I GOT INTO SKATEBOARDING

15:39.206 --> 15:40.540
WHEN SOME OF HUGO'S
CLASSMATES DID,

15:40.573 --> 15:43.476
AND HE REALIZED
HE COULD NEVER DO IT.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.413
IT'S THE SAME
WITH A LOT OF THINGS.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.249
WE LIVE THROUGH IT
TOGETHER.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.551
AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
YOU'RE BEING SELFLESS

15:51.584 --> 15:54.254
TO THE POINT
OF SELF-DENIAL?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.257
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
INSPIRED BY SOMEONE?

15:57.290 --> 16:01.461
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR PILLS?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.396
[coughs, gasps]

16:03.430 --> 16:06.766
NEED SOME HELP IN HERE.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.069
HEMOTHORAX.
WE NEED TO BRONCH HER NOW.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.170
CLEAR AN O.R.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.005
SHE'S DROWNING
IN HER OWN BLOOD.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.274
IT'S NOT AMYLOIDOSIS.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.414
SHE'S BLEEDING TO DEATH.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.416
OUT OF HER LUNG.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.785
I WANT TO FILL
A QUARTER OF IT WITH FOAM.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.255
THAT'D STOP THE BLEEDING,
ALL RIGHT.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.491
THOUGHT IT MADE MORE SENSE
THAN DIET AND EXERCISE.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.526
AND IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH LUNG FUNCTION LEFT,

16:33.560 --> 16:34.527
YOU'LL HAVE KILLED HER.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.197
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE
IS SLOWLY SUTURING THE LUNG,

16:37.230 --> 16:39.099
HOPING THAT THE BLEEDING
STOPS IN TIME

16:39.132 --> 16:40.433
AND SHE DOESN'T DIE
ON HER OWN.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.769
BUT WE WOULD WALK AWAY
WITH CLEAN HANDS.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.004
EXCEPT FOR ALL THE BLOOD.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.776
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.078
FASTER AND RISKIER'S BETTER.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.779
FOAM THE LUNG.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.054
GOT A GREEN LIGHT?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.728
NO.
SUTURE THE LUNG.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.498
SCALPEL,
RIB SPREADER.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.071
I CAN'T HANDLE IT.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.608
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:21.641 --> 17:25.512
SHE SAID "YES,"
AND I HEARD "NO."

17:25.545 --> 17:26.813
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
HEAR "NO."

17:26.846 --> 17:30.417
BUT I JUST...WAS SURE
THAT'S WHAT SHE MEANT.

17:30.450 --> 17:35.188
WAY SHE TILTED HER HEAD
AND HALF-ARCHED HER EYEBROW.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.623
WHAT DO I EVEN CARE
WHAT SHE MEANT?

17:36.656 --> 17:40.760
SHE SAID YES.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.729
I'M SCREWING THIS UP.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.498
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY BAD,
HOUSE.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.234
YOU CARE ENOUGH
TO PULL YOUR PUNCHES.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.201
THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.803
BUT YOU AND CUDDY
HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

17:50.837 --> 17:52.572
OF AVOIDING THIS PROBLEM.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.742
SET SOME GROUND RULES.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.211
YEAH.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.547
I HAVE TO AVOID
THIS PROBLEM.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.749
IF I CAN RESTRICT
OUR INTERACTIONS

18:02.782 --> 18:05.652
TO PLACES WHERE NEITHER OF US
ARE WEARING PANTS...

18:05.685 --> 18:07.854
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
AVOIDING THE PROBLEM,

18:07.887 --> 18:10.390
THAT'S AVOIDING THE ISSUE.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.193
SINCE AVOIDANCE IS MY PLAN
FOR DEALING WITH THE ISSUE,

18:13.226 --> 18:16.163
TECHNICALLY,
THAT'S NOT AVOIDING IT.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.131
THANKS.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.132
NO PROBLEM.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.235
[door closes]

18:22.269 --> 18:24.171
STITCHING WORKED.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.172
THIS TIME.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.173
NO GUARANTEE BOWING TO CUDDY

18:26.206 --> 18:28.375
WILL WORK NEXT TIME.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.677
HEART ARRHYTHMIA,
KIDNEY FAILURE,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.345
AND NOW BLEEDING LUNG.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.514
I DON'T WANT TO CRITICIZE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BUT--

18:34.547 --> 18:35.748
HEY, YOU'VE BEEN ON ME
FOR YEARS

18:35.782 --> 18:36.916
TO RESPECT SOMEONE'S OPINION.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.751
JUST 'CAUSE I HAD
TO GO OUTSIDE THIS GROUP

18:38.785 --> 18:39.752
TO FIND ONE I RESPECT.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.188
MULTI-SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT

18:41.221 --> 18:42.189
CENTERED IN THE LUNG.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.256
SARCOIDOSIS?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.591
DOESN'T EXPLAIN
THE HEMOTHORAX.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.259
TB CAN AFFECT
ALL THREE ORGANS.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.427
SKIN TEST WAS NEGATIVE.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.795
WHAT ABOUT
GOODPASTURE'S?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.864
AFFECTS THE LUNGS,
KIDNEYS.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.168
AND AUTOIMMUNE EXPLAINS
THE OUT OF THE BLUE ARRHYTHMIA.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.169
GOODPASTURE'S IT IS.

18:56.203 --> 18:59.306
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS AND
PLASMAPHERESIS TO TREAT,

18:59.339 --> 19:01.808
KIDNEY BIOPSY TO CONFIRM.

19:06.513 --> 19:10.317
[announcements over P.A.]

19:10.350 --> 19:12.685
DR. HOUSE.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.755
DON'T TELL ME, YOUR FATHER'S
HAIRLINE IS RECEDING,

19:15.788 --> 19:17.190
AND HE NEEDS MORE TESTS.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.658
HE'S 102.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.893
HIS NEXT TEST IS AN AUTOPSY.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.462
LOOK,
I LOVE THE OLD MAN,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.198
BUT I GOT TO GET HIM
OUT OF THE DAMN HOUSE.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.367
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT ME.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.870
HE NEEDS TO BE
IN A CARE FACILITY.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.839
WELL, SO TELL HIM.
HE'S A BIG BOY NOW.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.575
I CAN'T.
I'M HIS WHOLE LIFE.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.811
BUT IF IT COMES
FROM A DOCTOR...

19:44.984 --> 19:47.687
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.
WHEN YOU WERE 30.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.260
PRETEND TO RUN THE TESTS,

19:53.293 --> 19:55.795
AND THEN TELL HIM...

19:55.828 --> 19:58.298
HE CAN'T LIVE WITH ME
ANYMORE.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.544
I DIDN'T RUN INTO YOU
ALL AFTERNOON.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.280
I MISSED YOU.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.516
BUSY DAY.

20:16.549 --> 20:21.321
MAYBE WE SHOULD
PLAN ON LUNCH TOMORROW.

20:21.354 --> 20:27.627
PROBLEM IS, AT LUNCH
YOU TEND TO WEAR TOPS.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.397
THIS IS MUCH BETTER.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.503
[phone rings]

20:41.908 --> 20:43.643
CUDDY AND I ARE NAKED.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.812
SO I'M HAVING
TROUBLE FOCUSING.

20:45.845 --> 20:46.813
USE SMALL WORDS.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.348
KIDNEY BIOPSY WAS CLEAN,

20:48.381 --> 20:50.350
SO WE RECHECKED THE PIECE
OF HER LUNG FROM THE O.R.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.719
YOU LOST ME.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.853
SORRY, WHO IS THIS
CALLING AGAIN?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.388
IT'S NOT GOODPASTURE'S.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.424
THERE'S INTIMAL THICKENING
OF THE BLOOD VESSELS.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.791
AND LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATE.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.360
WE TESTED FOR LAM.
IT'S POSITIVE.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.160
PLUS HER LUNG'S FRIED.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.662
SHE NEEDS
A DONOR LUNG TO LIVE,

21:02.695 --> 21:04.731
WHICH IS THE ONLY TREATMENT
FOR LAM, ANYWAY.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.399
TAUB'S GONE TO
THE TRANSPLANT COMMITTEE.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.700
THEY MAY HAVE FOUND
A DONOR LUNG.

21:07.734 --> 21:11.438
SO THIS CALL
IS PURELY EXPOSITIONAL.

21:11.471 --> 21:15.007
[shuts cell phone]

21:15.041 --> 21:16.343
I SHOULD REALLY
GET DRESSED.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.877
I TOLD THE NANNY
I'D BE HOME BY 9:00.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.480
AND I SLIPPED
THE NANNY 40 BUCKS,

21:20.513 --> 21:23.350
TOLD HER TO STAY
TILL 10:00.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.351
REALLY?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.486
MM-HMM, REALLY.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.901
GOOD NEWS.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.475
(Foreman)
SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL,

21:48.508 --> 21:49.909
BUT THE DONOR LUNG
STARTED FAILING

21:49.942 --> 21:51.678
ABOUT AN HOUR
INTO RECOVERY.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.779
WE KNOW WE'RE RIGHT
ABOUT LAM.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.946
TESTS CONFIRMED IT.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.582
THAT LEAVES US
WITH TWO OPTIONS.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.983
BODY'S REJECTING
THE NEW LUNG

21:57.016 --> 21:58.985
OR WE SHOULD HAVE
REJECTED THE NEW LUNG

21:59.018 --> 22:00.620
BECAUSE IT'S INFECTED.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.788
LET'S BIOPSY,
SEE WHICH ONE IT IS.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.822
NO GUARANTEE

22:02.855 --> 22:04.424
WE'D HIT
THE AFFECTED SPOT.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.825
IF WE GIVE STEROIDS
FOR REJECTION,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.059
IT'D MAKE
AN INFECTION WORSE.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.795
IF WE GIVE ANTIBIOTICS
FOR INFECTION,

22:08.828 --> 22:10.363
IT'D MAKE REJECTION WORSE.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.631
WHICH WORSE IS WORSE?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.932
IF WE TREAT FOR INFECTION
AND WE'RE WRONG,

22:12.965 --> 22:14.133
SHE'LL BE DEAD
WITHIN HOURS.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.768
AND IF WE TREAT FOR
REJECTION AND WE'RE WRONG?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.504
SHE'LL PROBABLY HANG ON
A DAY OR TWO.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.706
YOU'RE ASSUMING
HER REJECTION'S HYPERACUTE.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.808
ODDS ARE, IT ISN'T.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.844
GOTTA HEAD OFF
THE WORST WORSE FIRST.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.713
I STUDIED UNDER
DR. SEUSS.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.982
START WITH IV METHYLPREDNISOLONE
FOR HYPERACUTE REJECTION.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.652
IF THAT FAILS, WE'LL SWITCH HER
TO BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS

22:32.685 --> 22:35.855
AND HOPE WE'RE NOT
TOO LATE.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.627
CAT GOT YOUR LEGS?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.161
WE JUST DECIDED
TO GIVE MEDS

22:42.194 --> 22:44.931
THAT COULD KILL THE PATIENT
BASED ON A GUESS.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.799
YOU NEED APPROVAL FROM CUDDY,

22:46.833 --> 22:48.501
AND SHE'LL WANT TO TAKE
THE SAFER COURSE,

22:48.535 --> 22:50.970
AND YOU'RE GONNA FOLD
LIKE AN ORIGAMI CRANE, SO...

22:51.003 --> 22:55.074
I'LL JUST WAIT HERE
TILL WE GET OUR ACTUAL ORDERS.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.643
FINE. YOU DO IT.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.011
TELL HER
SHE'S BEING AN IDIOT

22:59.045 --> 23:01.548
FOR ALWAYS CHOOSING
THE SAFER COURSE.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.851
SHE'S SITTING ON HER AMPLE,
IF WELL-FORMED, BUREAUCRATIC ASS

23:04.884 --> 23:05.785
WHILE OUR PATIENT'S DYING.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.987
WE'LL SEE WHO FOLDS
LIKE AN ORIGAMI SHRIMP.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.890
YOU WANT ME TO GET
CUDDY'S APPROVAL?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.459
I GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE
IMPORTANT.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.893
SITTING AT YOUR DESK?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.662
I'M RUNNING LATE.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.481
FORGET THE TESTS.

23:34.514 --> 23:38.150
I THINK JUNIOR MIGHT HAVE
A FEW WORDS TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.988
I LOVE HIM,
BUT HE CAN'T LET GO.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.591
40 BUCKS SAYS HE CAN.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.126
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT HIM HELPING ME

23:47.159 --> 23:49.061
LIKE I'M SENILE.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.764
IF I GO BACK THERE,
I'M GONNA RIP HIS THROAT OUT.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.100
YOU SURE YOU WON'T WARM UP
TO HIM OVER TIME?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.040
SKIP THE BLOOD WORK.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.876
TELL MY SON IT'S GRIM NEWS.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.045
I NEED TO BE
IN A NURSING HOME.

24:06.078 --> 24:09.048
A PRIVATE ROOM.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.717
MAKE IT A SUITE.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.619
BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

24:14.086 --> 24:18.891
I SIT AROUND
ON MY BUREAUCRATIC ASS?

24:18.925 --> 24:20.527
I WAS RELAYING
YOUR WORDS.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.962
I SAID WELL-FORMED.
I SAID WELL-FORMED!

24:22.995 --> 24:24.764
WHAT WERE YOU--

24:24.797 --> 24:26.933
I NEEDED TO BE AGGRESSIVE.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.936
SHE WAS SIDING
WITH FOREMAN'S ANALYSIS.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.071
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST IT
BEING HYPERACUTE REJECTION.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.073
STOP.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.642
I AGREE WITH YOU.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.977
THAT WAS OUR ANALYSIS
FROM THE START.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.112
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM
WITH A TEAM DECISION,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.014
YOU COME TO ME.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.751
I'M SORRY.
I-I'LL DEAL WITH HIM LATER.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.821
I SAID WELL-FORMED.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.830
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT
SEEN CUDDY NAKED

24:57.864 --> 24:59.766
SHOULD NOT THROW STONES.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.935
SHE DOES HAVE
GREAT CANS.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.105
CUDDY HAS HOUSE
ON SUCH A SHORT LEASH,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.074
SHE MIGHT AS WELL START
GIVING HIM CHEW TOYS.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.877
LET'S GIVE THE ANTIBIOTICS
AT LEAST ANOTHER HOUR.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.546
AMAZING. AND HOUSE HASN'T
GIVEN YOU ONE OUNCE OF GRIEF

25:13.580 --> 25:16.015
FOR YOUR COMPLETE LACK
OF INTEREST IN HIS LOVE LIFE?

25:16.048 --> 25:18.551
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT HOUSE IS JUST HAPPY

25:18.585 --> 25:20.319
AND COULD GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES

25:20.352 --> 25:21.688
BECAUSE OF IT?

25:21.721 --> 25:24.190
WELL, THAT'S IRONIC
AND DEPRESSING.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.858
AND BY THAT LOGIC,

25:25.892 --> 25:27.594
THE REASON
YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP

25:27.627 --> 25:29.128
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE HAPPY,

25:29.161 --> 25:31.030
WHICH MEANS
YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE NEW

25:31.063 --> 25:33.165
GIVING YOU CHEW TOYS.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.567
YOU'RE 1/4TH RIGHT.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.968
WAIT.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.237
ARE YOU SAYING...
[pagers beep]

25:38.270 --> 25:40.139
YOU'RE DATING
FOUR WOMEN?

25:46.078 --> 25:47.279
(Chase)
BP'S DROPPING.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.081
MEANS THE ANTIBIOTICS
AREN'T WORKING.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.718
PUT HER IN TRENDELENBURG.
CAN YOU SAVE THE LUNG?

25:51.751 --> 25:54.053
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
WE GOT A BETTER CHANCE NOW.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.988
THIS MEANS REJECTION,
NOT INFECTION.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.090
START HER ON IV
METHYLPREDNISOLONE RIGHT AWAY.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.292
[machine beeping]

26:03.996 --> 26:05.131
WOW.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.033
YOU HATE SALAD.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.802
SHE'S REALLY GOT YOU
TIED UP IN KNOTS.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.104
I CAVED.
THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.273
I NEED A PLAN "C."

26:14.306 --> 26:17.309
WHAT YOU NEED IS A PLAN
THAT YOU ACTUALLY DEVELOP

26:17.343 --> 26:20.079
WITH CUDDY.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.216
ANTIBIOTICS DIDN'T WORK
AND THEN STEROIDS DIDN'T WORK.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.618
THE NEW LUNG'S RUINED,

26:25.652 --> 26:27.286
AND IT'S NOT REJECTION
OR INFECTION.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.221
THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS
WERE WRONG.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.623
UNLESS IT'S NOT LAM.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.192
IT IS LAM.
THE TESTS WERE POSITIVE.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.028
THEN THE TESTS
HAVE TO BE WRONG.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.097
DEEP-FRYER'S WORKING AGAIN.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.399
STILL WORKING ON THAT?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.401
NO, IT WAS HERE
WHEN I SAT DOWN.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.803
I NEED TO THINK.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.167
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE TRYING EVERYTHING

27:15.201 --> 27:16.836
TO SAVE MY SISTER.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.671
EVERYTHING?

27:18.705 --> 27:21.207
WELL, THAT MUST BE IT.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.275
SEE, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
CHECKED THE BOX MARKED,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.977
"TRY EVERY OTHER THING."

27:25.011 --> 27:27.246
I'M THE ONE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO DIE FIRST.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.916
I'M THE DAMAGED ONE,
NOT HER.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.718
SHE NEVER EVEN GETS
A COLD.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.853
DAMAGE HAS A WAY OF SPREADING
TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.022
FOR EXAMPLE,
YOUR OBVIOUS EMOTIONAL DAMAGE

27:36.055 --> 27:38.157
IS NOW MAKING ME HAVE
A PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATION

27:38.190 --> 27:39.992
INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH
YOUR SISTER.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.762
SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE
DAMAGING?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.371
NEVER?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.142
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD A COLD?

27:56.175 --> 27:59.245
ANY MINOR ACHES,
SWELLING, ANYTHING?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.849
[mutters]
IT'S BEEN YEARS.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.117
SHE NEVER GETS COLDS.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.086
I DIDN'T ASK WHEN'S
THE LAST TIME SHE MENTIONED IT.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.022
I ASKED WHEN SHE HAD ONE--
EVEN A TINY ONE.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.724
IT'S NOTHING.

28:11.758 --> 28:15.261
SOMETIMES MY EARS
ACHE A LITTLE.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.797
SO NOW TELL ME
THE REST OF THE NOTHING.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.466
M-MY CHEST...

28:20.499 --> 28:22.735
SORENESS.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.203
SOME CONGESTION.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.138
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.874
I BARELY NOTICED IT

28:27.907 --> 28:29.842
UNTIL THAT SKATEBOARDING
TOURNAMENT IN DENVER.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.143
HOW LONG AGO?

28:31.177 --> 28:33.145
A...YEAR?

28:34.313 --> 28:35.815
COLD'S NOTHING
WHEN I THINK OF

28:35.848 --> 28:38.150
WHAT HUGO
GOES THROUGH EVERY DAY.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.219
YEAH, WE GET IT.
YOUR BROTHER, THE SAINT.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.789
HIS SISTER, THE MARTYR.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.227
THANK GOD YOU FOLLOWED ME.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.229
NOW YOU CAN GO BACK
TO THE TRANSPLANT COMMITTEE

28:50.262 --> 28:51.864
WHILE I GET CONFIRMATION.

28:51.898 --> 28:52.865
CONFIRMATION OF WHAT?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.401
WHAT CAUSES LOW-LEVEL
COLD SYMPTOMS FOR A YEAR,

28:55.434 --> 28:57.770
CAN RUIN TWO LUNGS,
IS IMMUNE TO DRUG THERAPIES,

28:57.804 --> 29:00.239
AND GETS WORSE IN CITIES
NICKNAMED MILE-HIGH?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.440
A CLOTTING DISORDER?

29:01.473 --> 29:03.542
SHE HAS A NASTY CASE
OF SICKLE CELL TRAIT.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.878
HER HEART ARRHYTHMIA
WASN'T SUDDEN AT ALL.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.080
SCREWED-UP BLOOD CELLS
SCREWED UP THE BLOOD VESSELS

29:08.114 --> 29:10.950
WHICH GAVE US A SCREWED-UP
POSITIVE FOR LAM.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.886
IF SHE'D TOLD US ABOUT
HER SYMPTOMS SOONER--LIKE EVER--

29:13.920 --> 29:15.187
SHE MIGHT NOT BE DYING.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.789
YOU WERE RIGHT AFTER ALL.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.257
I NEVER SAID SICKLE--

29:18.290 --> 29:19.926
IF EVERYONE
WERE MORE SELFISH,

29:19.959 --> 29:22.294
THE WORLD WOULD BE
A BETTER PLACE.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.297
SO SHE'S GONNA DIE.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.034
UNLESS WE CAN FIND--

29:28.067 --> 29:29.902
SHE BURNED THROUGH
ONE DONOR LUNG.

29:29.936 --> 29:33.940
TRANSPLANT COMMITTEE'S NEVER
GONNA GIVE HER A SECOND ONE.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.308
WELL, THEN I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN.

29:40.079 --> 29:43.149
UNLESS WE DON'T NEED
THEIR APPROVAL.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.160
YOU CAN'T ADVISE
YOUR PATIENT'S PARENTS

29:54.193 --> 29:57.897
TO TAKE MARROW AND HALF A LUNG
FROM THEIR SON!

29:57.930 --> 30:01.200
I GUESS I CAN JUST CHAT
WITH THEM ABOUT THE WEATHER.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.569
BLOOD TESTS JUST CONFIRMED
SICKLE CELL TRAIT.

30:03.602 --> 30:07.840
SO THEY MIGHT BE CURIOUS
ABOUT THE ONLY TREATMENT OPTION.

30:07.874 --> 30:10.176
THOUGH WE ARE HAVING
WEIRD WEATHER LATELY.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.178
THERE IS A HUGE REASON
NOT TO TAKE LUNGS

30:12.211 --> 30:13.880
FROM LIVING PATIENTS.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.381
SO THEIR SIBLINGS CAN DIE?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.983
THEIR SON HAS CMD.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.986
AS IT IS, HE'S GONNA DIE
OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE BY 25.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.921
WE COULD CUT WHATEVER TIME
HE HAS LEFT IN HALF.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.623
THAT QUALIFIES AS A BAD REASON
FOR THEM TO REJECT THE IDEA.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.859
IT'S A MUCH WORSE REASON
FOR THEM NOT TO GET THE CHOICE.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.861
IT'S COERCIVE TO TELL THEM!

30:28.895 --> 30:30.496
YOU EVER HEAR OF
"DO NO HARM"?

30:30.529 --> 30:32.198
THAT WAS SECOND YEAR, RIGHT?

30:32.231 --> 30:33.933
'CAUSE I HAD MONO
ALL THAT FALL.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.067
THEIR SON'S
NOT EVEN OUR PATIENT.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.435
WHY DON'T WE JUST
TAKE HALF A LUNG

30:36.468 --> 30:38.137
FROM SOME GUY IN THE CLINIC
WITH A TOOTHACHE?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.371
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.173
NOW WE CAN GIVE
THE PARENTS TWO OPTIONS.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.876
WE DON'T COMPROMISE
ONE LIFE FOR ANOTHER.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.048
OKAY.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.653
OKAY?

30:54.686 --> 30:57.489
SERIOUSLY.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.958
YOU MADE AN ARGUMENT.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.159
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO DEFER TO YOU,

31:00.192 --> 31:01.527
WHY MAKE IT AT ALL?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.030
BUT ARE YOU
DEFERRING TO ME

31:04.063 --> 31:07.333
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER?

31:10.436 --> 31:12.438
MAYBE.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.108
YEAH. I THINK SO.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.910
THIS IS SCREWING ME UP.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.412
WHY IS IT NOT
SCREWING YOU UP?

31:21.680 --> 31:25.918
IT IS.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.420
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I OKAYED YOU FOAMING THAT LUNG.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.057
I REALIZED IT WAS WRONG
AS SOON AS I SAID IT.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.358
I KNEW IT!

31:32.391 --> 31:34.026
I KNEW 'CAUSE YOU
TILTED YOUR HEAD.

31:34.060 --> 31:38.497
HOUSE...WE ARE
SCREWING THIS UP.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.699
I'M GONNA CALL HR,

31:40.732 --> 31:44.937
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO SUPERVISE
YOU AS SOON AS I CAN.

32:00.386 --> 32:03.022
I'VE GOT YOUR...

32:03.055 --> 32:05.024
TEST RESULTS.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.460
YOU HAVE THE METABOLISM,
BLOOD COUNTS,

32:08.494 --> 32:11.130
LIVER AND KIDNEY FUNCTION
OF A 92-YEAR-OLD.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.999
WHICH IS GREAT,
'CAUSE YOU'RE 102.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.500
WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT

32:14.533 --> 32:16.468
IS THE AVERAGE
LIFE EXPECTANCY IS 78.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.370
IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION
THAT YOU MOVE INTO A HOME

32:18.404 --> 32:20.106
WITH ROUND-THE-CLOCK CARE.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.974
OH...

32:22.008 --> 32:24.243
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

32:24.276 --> 32:27.513
CAN'T MY SON GIVE ME
ROUND-THE-CLOCK CARE?

32:27.546 --> 32:30.016
NOT UNLESS YOU'VE DONE
YOUR TWO-YEAR CERTIFICATION

32:30.049 --> 32:31.717
IN TIBURON SWAB TECHNOLOGY.

32:31.750 --> 32:32.618
THERE MUST BE
SOME OTHER WAY.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.686
JUST BECAUSE HE HAS
A LITTLE TINGLING

32:34.720 --> 32:37.990
AND SOME TROUBLE FEELING
HOT AND COLD

32:38.024 --> 32:41.727
AND SOME DIFFICULTY--
YOU CAN'T FEEL HOT AND COLD?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.595
NOT LATELY.
BUT AT MY AGE...

32:43.629 --> 32:45.597
SHOW ME YOUR TEETH.

32:48.234 --> 32:51.037
DENTURES.
FAIRLY WORN.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.472
I'M GUESSING TEN YEARS OLD.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.741
SHOW ME YOUR DENTURE CREAM.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.710
WHY WOULD HE CARRY
DENTURE CREAM?

32:58.744 --> 33:01.713
BECAUSE...

33:01.747 --> 33:03.449
HE HAS...

33:03.482 --> 33:05.351
ZINC POISONING.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.019
BUT TO GET IT
FROM DENTURE CREAM,

33:07.053 --> 33:08.320
HE'D HAVE TO TAKE
SO MUCH OF IT--

33:08.354 --> 33:10.089
TRUST ME, HE NEVER
LEAVES HOME WITHOUT IT.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.590
HOW MUCH DO YOU USE, POP?

33:11.623 --> 33:14.793
ABOUT A TUBE A DAY.
I BUY IT ONLINE.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.795
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.065
BIZARRELY, IT EXPLAINS
ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.233
BETTER-FITTING DENTURES,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

33:21.267 --> 33:25.104
MEDICALLY, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GO ANYWHERE.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.347
HOSPITAL REBATE.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.184
YOU MIGHT WANNA...

33:38.217 --> 33:40.352
PUT IT TOWARDS
COUPLES THERAPY.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.388
[men mumbling together]

33:56.102 --> 33:58.137
THE TRANSPLANT
COMMITTEE'S...

33:58.170 --> 34:00.339
NEVER GONNA GIVE MY DAUGHTER
ANOTHER LUNG, ARE THEY?

34:00.372 --> 34:01.373
NO.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.843
ARE THERE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.745
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.216
LOOKING INTO WHAT?

34:13.352 --> 34:14.320
PLEASE.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.222
TELL ME.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.224
GIVE ME SOME KIND OF HOPE.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.858
I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.660
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.795
WHAT CAN'T YOU TELL ME?

34:26.532 --> 34:31.503
IF THERE'S ANY...CHANCE
YOU CAN SAVE HER,

34:31.537 --> 34:34.440
ANYTHING YOU CAN TRY...

34:40.179 --> 34:43.849
WE CAN TAKE MARROW
AND HALF A LUNG FROM YOUR SON.

34:46.385 --> 34:50.622
IT WOULD LIKELY SHORTEN
HIS LIFE SIGNIFICANTLY.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.861
HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO GO
ON A RESPIRATOR IF HE NEEDED TO.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.396
MOST PEOPLE WITH CMD NEED TO

34:57.429 --> 34:59.865
AS THEIR RESPIRATORY
FUNCTION DECLINES.

35:09.541 --> 35:10.876
HOW LONG...

35:10.909 --> 35:13.345
DO WE HAVE TO DECIDE?

35:13.379 --> 35:16.315
MORNING AT THE LATEST.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.189
THANK YOU.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.634
[conversation not audible
under somber music]

35:35.667 --> 35:43.675
*

36:00.826 --> 36:02.894
WHERE ARE MY PARENTS?

36:02.928 --> 36:06.898
THEY'RE PROBABLY DEALING WITH
COMMITTEE ISSUES OR SOMETHING.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.201
THEY WERE ARGUING.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.203
I SAW MY MOM CRYING.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.472
LOOKED LIKE MY DAD
WAS YELLING AT HER.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.375
THEY CARE ABOUT YOU
A LOT.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.986
HUGO WAS A MARROW MATCH?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.956
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT NOW.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.660
THEY WANT A LUNG
FROM HIM TOO.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.563
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

36:39.998 --> 36:42.834
NO. IT'S NOTHING
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.405
EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON GETTING
YOU THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

37:02.454 --> 37:06.292
HOW DO THEY EXPECT US
TO GO ON FROM HERE?

37:08.794 --> 37:12.631
WE MAKE A CHOICE...
AND WE LIVE WITH IT.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.032
[sobs]

37:14.065 --> 37:15.934
THERE'S NO LIVING
WITH IT.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.604
NO MATTER WHAT
WE DECIDE.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.673
[running footsteps]

37:27.313 --> 37:31.383
[blowing breaths]

37:37.856 --> 37:41.360
STILL COLD AND CLAMMY.
SHE HAD A RESPIRATORY ARREST.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.828
OH, MY GOD!

37:42.861 --> 37:45.331
(father)
WHAT IS SHE DOING
HERE?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.898
SHE FIGURED OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.967
SHE'S PINKING UP.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.036
SHE MUST HAVE YANKED OFF
HER IVs AND OXYGEN.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.672
CAME HERE TO DIE.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.884
(Taub)
BY UNHOOKING HERSELF
FROM EVERYTHING,

38:05.917 --> 38:08.620
SHE DELIVERED A HYPOXIC
INSULT TO HER BODY

38:08.654 --> 38:11.623
THAT STARTED
A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.792
(Foreman)
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A DECISION,

38:13.825 --> 38:15.827
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.572
HR CAN'T FIND YOU
A NEW SUPERVISOR.

38:26.605 --> 38:27.739
HOW COME?

38:27.773 --> 38:30.576
BECAUSE YOU'RE
UNSUPERVISABLE, HOUSE.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.378
TWO DEPARTMENT CHAIRS
THREATENED TO QUIT.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.780
WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE STUCK WITH EACH OTHER.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.652
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I'M MAKING THIS CALL

38:40.686 --> 38:42.688
OR IF IT'S
THE RIGHT CALL TO MAKE.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.556
BUT IF YOU FEEL STRONGLY

38:44.590 --> 38:48.026
ABOUT PRESENTING THE PARENTS
YOUR TREATMENT OPTION,

38:48.059 --> 38:51.062
YOU CAN DO IT.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.799
THANK YOU, I WILL.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.834
SEVERAL HOURS AGO.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.069
YOU TOLD THEM?

38:58.103 --> 39:01.039
I TOLD HIM.
HE CAME TO MY OFFICE.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.813
I'M SORRY.

39:10.148 --> 39:14.352
WELL...I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE MORE MAD AT YOU.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.489
YEAH.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.727
DR. HOUSE?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.629
WE'VE DECIDED.

39:24.796 --> 39:28.099
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE
THE LUNG FROM MY SON.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.737
SHE'S STILL
ON THE WAITING LIST.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.805
WE'RE GONNA DO WHATEVER
WE CAN DO FIND HER ANOTHER--

39:33.839 --> 39:35.774
WHAT GINORMOUS CRACK PIPE

39:35.807 --> 39:37.409
HAVE YOU PEOPLE
BEEN SUCKING ON?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.745
HOUSE!
ARE YOU GONNA PRETEND

39:39.778 --> 39:41.112
THAT YOU'RE NOT CHOOSING
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER'S DEATH?

39:41.146 --> 39:42.781
OUR DAUGHTER
DOESN'T WANT IT.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.750
PROBABLY DOESN'T WANNA
FLOSS HER TEETH EITHER.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.585
SHE'S A MINDLESS
TEENYBOPPER.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.421
DON'T PUT THIS ON THEM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PUT IT ON?
IT IS ON THEM!

39:49.455 --> 39:51.657
AS MUCH AS THEY MAY
WANNA PASS THE LUNG HERE!

39:51.690 --> 39:53.058
OF COURSE THEY DO!

39:53.091 --> 39:54.793
YOU'RE HANDING THEM
AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.095
LIFE HAS HANDED THEM
A CRAPPY CHOICE,

39:57.128 --> 39:58.897
AND THEY'RE PICKING
THE CRAPPIER OPTION--

39:58.930 --> 40:01.066
TRADING WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
HEALTHY DECADES

40:01.099 --> 40:02.968
FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN WHICH
ROLLER BOY WILL BE A LIMP RAG.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.136
NOT EVERYTHING
IS A MATH EQUATION.
DO YOU NEED ME

40:05.170 --> 40:07.473
TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DECADE AND YEAR?

40:07.506 --> 40:08.874
THEIR SON
IS A HUMAN BEING.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.075
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE,
RIGHT?

40:10.108 --> 40:12.778
INTRINSIC VALUE.
WE DON'T GET TO DECIDE--

40:12.811 --> 40:14.780
AND WE DO IT EVERY DAY.
IF THE TWO OF THEM NEEDED

40:14.813 --> 40:16.982
THE SAME LUNG--
HE NEEDS TO KEEP
THE ONE HE'S GOT.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.785
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY GOD
BY RIPPING OUT--

40:19.818 --> 40:22.087
THAT TRAIN LEFT THE STATION WHEN
WE LEARNED TO DO TRANSPLANTS.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.889
THE REST IS JUST
PAPER-PUSHING.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.157
OF COURSE, NOW WE'RE ON TO YOUR
REAL AREA OF EXPERTISE.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.827
OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE
MOVING ON TO YOURS--

40:28.860 --> 40:30.095
BULLYING YOUR PATIENTS

40:30.128 --> 40:33.131
INTO EMBRACING YOUR OWN
LACK OF A MORAL--

40:36.735 --> 40:38.169
(mother)
HUGO. HONEY.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.772
WE DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO HEAR ANY OF THIS.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.508
HUGO, PLEASE!

40:58.289 --> 41:01.493
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
HALF MY LUNG.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.461
NO.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.499
I'M NOT.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.070
YOU DO SO MANY
GREAT THINGS.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.841
I JUST WATCH.

41:15.874 --> 41:20.045
I GET TO WATCH
AND COACH AND CHEER.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.848
BUT THAT'S NOT ME OUT THERE.

41:22.881 --> 41:26.518
IT NEVER WILL BE.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.756
IF YOU TAKE
THIS PIECE OF ME,

41:30.789 --> 41:33.525
CARRY IT WITH YOU...

41:33.559 --> 41:37.696
THEN I REALLY CAN SHARE
IN EVERYTHING YOU DO.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.899
THIS IS THE GREAT THING

41:40.932 --> 41:45.003
I CAN DO WITH MY LIFE.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.640
DON'T MAKE ME
LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.187
[all crying]

42:22.708 --> 42:24.009
WE GOT LUCKY.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.050
I DID GIVE THEM
AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.285
THE KID TOOK IT
AWAY FROM THEM.

42:34.319 --> 42:38.056
THAT FIGHT...

42:38.089 --> 42:40.592
WAS THE FIRST
HONEST INTERACTION

42:40.626 --> 42:42.961
YOU AND I HAVE HAD
SINCE WE CAME BACK TO WORK.

42:45.831 --> 42:49.601
IF WE ARE PAINFULLY,
BRUTALLY HONEST WITH EACH OTHER,

42:49.635 --> 42:52.237
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY
AGAIN.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.075
YOU'VE GOT A BIG ASS.
