WEBVTT

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
{\an1}CLEANING FLUID? ALFIE DRANK
CLEANING FLUID?

00:33.825 --> 00:37.454
THAT IS WHAT THE HOSPITAL SAID.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.830
YEAH RIGHT.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.875
{\an1}PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO
ENLIGHTEN US ON EXACTLY

00:41.958 --> 00:44.961
{\an1}WHAT YOU THINK WAS IN THAT
BOTTLE MISS WILLIAMSON?

00:45.044 --> 00:47.464
PASS.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.553
TRUDYKINS. HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

00:53.636 --> 00:59.934
{\an4}OLD ENOUGH AND WISE ENOUGH TO
KNOW WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING,
JEROME. OUT WITH IT.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.687
{\an1}WELL YOU KNOW HOW ALFIE AND
ME ARE BEST MATES YEAH?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.772
AND NOW HE'S IN A HOSPITAL BED

01:04.855 --> 01:06.608
PROBABLY BORED TO DEATH
WITH NO-ONE TO TALK TO

01:06.691 --> 01:10.361
{\an1}EXCEPT OLD MEN WITH HACKING
COUGHS AND BAD BREATH.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.655
{\an1}I WANT THE DAY OFF TO GO
AND VISIT HIM.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.865
FINE.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.243
COME ON, TRUDY! IT'S NOT
LIKE I'VE BEEN... FINE?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.787
BUT NOT THE WHOLE
DAY THOUGH.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.705
{\an1}YOU CAN HAVE A COUPLE OF
HOURS THIS AFTERNOON.

01:20.789 --> 01:24.584
{\an1}ERM, TRUDY? CAN I DO THAT
AS WELL, PLEASE?

01:24.667 --> 01:27.921
{\an4}I FEEL A BIT BAD THAT HE'S NOT
GOT SOMETHING NICE TO LOOK AT
WHILST HE'S IN THERE.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.090
OH OKAY. I'LL SEE WHAT I
CAN CLEAR WITH MR SWEET.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.175
ERM, TRUDY. HOW,

01:32.258 --> 01:34.928
{\an1}NO! I CAN ONLY GET PERMISSION
FOR TWO OF YOU TO GO.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.430
{\an1}YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT IT OUT
AMONGST YOURSELVES.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.265
OF COURSE I SHOULD BE THE
ONE TO GO. ALFIE LOVES ME.

01:39.349 --> 01:46.105
{\an4}AMBER, WATCH MY LIPS. I AM
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL, NOT
YOU.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.818
{\an5}"THE ONLY PLACE WHERE
YESTERDAY ALWAYS FOLLOWS
TOMORROW"

01:49.901 --> 01:52.987
{\an1}WHAT IS IT, WHAT IS IT,
WHAT IS IT?

01:53.071 --> 01:56.032
I MEAN, WHAT IF IT'S
NOT A BOOK?

01:56.115 --> 01:58.284
{\an1}NINA, WHO DO YOU THINK
SHOULD GO?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.870
GUYS, I'M OUT, REMEMBER.

02:00.954 --> 02:06.251
{\an1}BESIDES, I'M BUSY READING
"PINK PONY PARADE"?

02:06.334 --> 02:09.545
ALFIE NEEDS SOMEONE TO CHEER
HIM UP, NOT TO SHOUT AT HIM.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.256
{\an1}AND THAT'S WHY I WORE
THIS LIPGLOSS.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.008
WHO'S GONNA BE SHOUTING?

02:14.092 --> 02:17.137
{\an4}I WON'T BE SHOUTING AMBER,
I'LL BE INTERROGATING HIM.
THAT'S ALL.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.098
{\an1}DON'T TRY TO CONFUSE YOU ME
WITH YOUR FANCY WORDS.

02:20.181 --> 02:24.394
{\an1}ERR, IT'S IN THE DICTIONARY,
AMBER. IT'S NOT FANCY.

02:24.477 --> 02:28.189
IN THE DICTIONARY.
OF COURSE.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.530
{\an1}"THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YESTERDAY
ALWAYS FOLLOWS TOMORROW."

02:35.613 --> 02:40.910
{\an1}A DICTIONARY. YOU GENIUS,
GENIUS, GENIUS, GENIUS GIRL.

02:40.994 --> 02:46.916
{\an1}OKAY, THAT HAPPENED.
BUT I'M STILL OUT GUYS.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.376
{\an1}SO THE CLUE MEANS YOUR
DICTIONARY?

02:48.459 --> 02:52.088
{\an4}NOT MY DICTIONARY, A
LEATHER-BOUND CLASPED
DICTIONARY.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.592
{\an1}DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME LOOK
FOR IT NINA?

02:55.675 --> 03:03.600
{\an5}I HAVE TO FINISH READING
THIS ARTICLE ON... 'WINTER
PONY GROOMING."

03:03.683 --> 03:14.110
{\an1}NINA, SARAH GAVE THIS
TO YOU - NOT ME.

03:17.488 --> 03:21.910
AH!

03:21.993 --> 03:23.244
YES!!

03:23.328 --> 03:29.250
(Game console noises)

03:32.170 --> 03:34.005
YO, DUDE, WHASSUP?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.924
YOU KNOW. BEEN BETTER.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.843
QUIT PLAY-ACTING YOU GOOF.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.471
{\an1}WE JUST SAW YOU OBLITERATING
ALIENS.

03:41.554 --> 03:46.142
WE BROUGHT YOU SOME GRAPES.

03:46.225 --> 03:47.310
JEROME ATE THEM ALL.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.436
YOU DID YOU MEAN!

03:48.519 --> 03:51.105
{\an1}HERE. GO AND BUY HIM SOME
CHOCOLATE.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.442
CHOCOLATE. YUM-YUM!

03:54.525 --> 03:58.363
{\an1}SO COME ON. TELL ME WHAT YOU
SAW DOWN IN THE CELLAR.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.323
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.282
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.493
IT'S TRUE. IT'S LIKE
A TOTAL BLANK.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.703
{\an1}HANG ON, WHY AM I BUYING THE
CHOCOLATE? YOU GO!

04:05.787 --> 04:07.080
ERR, BECAUSE I'M PAYING FOR IT.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.249
SO!

04:10.333 --> 04:11.084
NO MATTER WHAT,

04:11.167 --> 04:13.211
{\an1}I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR
EVER AND EVER

04:13.294 --> 04:16.172
BECAUSE I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.339
LOOKING GOOD, ALFIE.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.591
ALWAYS DO, NURSE DELIA.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.928
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE'LL
SOON BE SAYING GOODBYE TO YOU.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.515
ARGH! UM. FEEL SICK. OW!

04:25.598 --> 04:28.351
{\an1}SO WHAT WAS THE OFFICIAL
DIAGNOSIS?

04:28.434 --> 04:30.103
WE NEVER HEARD AT SCHOOL?

04:30.186 --> 04:33.064
{\an4}THE DOCTORS STILL AREN'T SURE.
SOME SORT OF ALLERGIC REACTION
TO SOMETHING HE DRANK?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.149
I THOUGHT HE DRANK
CLEANING FLUID?

04:35.233 --> 04:38.569
THE TESTS ARE STILL WITH
TOXICOLOGY.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.281
LEAVE THE THERMOMETER IN.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.706
{\an1}YOU KNOW, NURSE DELIA MAKES
GETTING SICK KIND OF APPEALING.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.708
KEEP YOUR EYES OFF MY NURSE.

04:51.791 --> 04:56.170
{\an5}YOUR NURSE? ALFIE, YOU ARE
WAY TOO UNVERSED IN THE LAWS
OF FLIRTATION - UNLIKE MOI.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.047
{\an1}DON'T WORRY. I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

04:58.131 --> 05:06.222
I'M GOING TO THE COFFEE
SHOP. LOSERS!

05:06.305 --> 05:08.891
{\an4}OH, THINK I MIGHT BE COMING
DOWN WITH A CASE OF DELIA
FEVER.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.106
{\an1}OH, MISS ROBINSON, MISS
ROBINSON,

05:15.189 --> 05:16.190
I NEED HELP.

05:16.274 --> 05:16.816
WHAT WITH?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.568
PREPARING FOR MY
SCHOLARSHIP.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.362
{\an4}MY TIMES ARE DOWN. I'M
BEHIND WITH MY PROJECT
WORK,

05:21.446 --> 05:21.821
I THOUGHT MARA,

05:21.904 --> 05:24.991
SHE'S ABANDONED ME.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.161
{\an4}OKAY. WELL, IF YOU WANT A
TRAINING PARTNER, I'M HAPPY
TO HELP.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.080
{\an5}BUT IT'LL BE MY RULES,
MY EXERCISES. HOW DOES
THAT SOUND?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.498
YEAH.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.498
RIGHT,

05:32.582 --> 05:34.250
FIRST TRAINING SESSION
THIS EVENING YEAH?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.919
MEET ME OUTSIDE SCHOOL AT
4.30.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.421
THANKS I REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.923
{\an4}WE'LL SEE IF YOU STILL FEEL
THAT WAY AFTER YOU'VE DONE A
FEW OF MY DRILLS.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.427
YEAH, HA HA.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.139
PHEW. IS IT ME, OR IS IT
HOT IN HERE?

05:48.222 --> 05:53.227
{\an4}MY HEART IS POUNDING. YOU
KNOW, I THINK IT MIGHT BE
PALPITATIONS.

05:53.311 --> 05:57.732
{\an1}FEEL HOW FAST MY PULSE IS
RACING.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.735
MY WORD. THAT IS
EXCEPTIONALLY FAST.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.612
IS IT?

06:02.695 --> 06:04.530
DANGEROUSLY SO, I'D SAY...

06:04.614 --> 06:05.782
IN WHAT WAY DANGEROUS?

06:05.865 --> 06:09.077
{\an1}I THINK YOU NEED AN INJECTION
OF BETA BLOCKERS STRAIGHT AWAY.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.787
BETA BLOCKERS?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.040
{\an4}DON'T WORRY. JUST BECAUSE THE
NEEDLE IS GIGANTIC, DOESN'T
ALWAYS MEAN IT HURTS MORE.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.793
ALTHOUGH, IN THIS
CASE IT DOES.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.003
{\an4}NO NURSE, I HAVEN'T
REALLY, I MEAN, I WAS
ONLY,

06:19.087 --> 06:24.675
WHAT? JOKING? GOTCHA.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.887
NICE ONE NURSE DELIA.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.139
{\an1}THIS COLOUR DOESN'T REALLY
SUIT MY COMPLEXION.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.350
{\an1}CAN'T I BE A BLUE BUDGIE
INSTEAD?

06:32.433 --> 06:36.145
{\an5}HOWARD CARTER TOOK HIS
CANARY TO TUTANKHAMEN'S
TOMB, NOT A BUDGERIGAR.

06:36.229 --> 06:36.521
DRAMATIC LICENSE?

06:36.604 --> 06:38.773
NO!

06:38.856 --> 06:41.526
{\an4}ABOUT TIME GUYS. REHEARSALS
WERE MEANT TO START TEN
MINUTES AGO.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.653
WELL?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.404
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
AS A DUCK?

06:45.488 --> 06:46.322
I'M A CANARY.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.824
A CANARY DRESSED AS A DUCK?

06:47.907 --> 06:50.076
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

06:50.159 --> 06:53.663
{\an1}WELL, WE WERE LOOKING FOR AN
OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY,

06:53.746 --> 06:59.043
{\an4}BUT THEN MASTERMIND HERE
THOUGHT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR AN
ARABIC DICTIONARY AND... TA-DA!

06:59.127 --> 07:01.712
(Amber squeals with
excitement)

07:01.796 --> 07:04.173
{\an4}WHAT'S WITH ALL THE
SQUEALING? CAN WE SET UP FOR
A RUN OF ACT ONE, PLEASE?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.843
{\an1}I DON'T THINK WE CAN.
I MEAN,

07:06.926 --> 07:08.302
I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE
ALFIE,

07:08.386 --> 07:08.803
{\an5}OR JEROME.

07:08.386 --> 07:08.803
OR PATRICIA.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.471
OR MARA.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.514
FANTASTIC.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.224
WE CAN ALWAYS DO MY
SCENE AGAIN.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.352
I SUPPOSE WE'LL HAVE TO.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.980
MARA'S HERE. WE CAN DO OUR
SCENE AS WELL IF YOU LIKE.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.190
{\an1}WHAT'S WITH THE STUPID
CHICKEN OUTFIT?

07:21.274 --> 07:25.653
{\an4}OKAY. MR WINKLER. I REALLY
DO NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THIS COSTUME.

07:25.736 --> 07:26.737
DO YOU WANT TO RUN SOME LINES?

07:26.821 --> 07:29.407
{\an1}NO.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.285
{\an1}MARA I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.411
OH REALLY?

07:33.494 --> 07:38.541
YEAH, WE WERE GETTING ON
GREAT, THEN WE KISSED...

07:38.624 --> 07:40.877
{\an1}AND YOU REGRET IT. YES. YOU'VE
SAID IT ALL BEFORE MICK.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.462
NO NEED TO GO OVER IT.

07:43.546 --> 07:48.676
{\an4}NO, BUT NOW YOU'VE GONE ALL
WEIRD AND I'VE LOST A TRAINING
PARTNER AND A FRIEND.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.761
THOUGHT YOU'D GOT A NEW
TRAINING PARTNER?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.722
MISS ROBINSON?

07:52.805 --> 07:55.892
SO MUCH FOR "CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU, MARA".

07:55.975 --> 07:57.226
ARE YOU JEALOUS?!

07:57.310 --> 08:00.188
WHY - IS THERE ANYTHING TO
BE JEALOUS OF?

08:00.271 --> 08:02.315
OH MARA YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

08:02.398 --> 08:06.194
{\an1}DON'T YOU LAUGH AT ME.
DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME.

08:06.277 --> 08:12.200
NO, I'M NOT, I'M SAYING...

08:14.869 --> 08:19.707
{\an1}WOW! IT'S A SUPERPOWER
CLASP.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.502
{\an1}IT'S REALLY STUCK.
TRY THE LOCKET!

08:23.586 --> 08:28.216
IT'S OPENED STUFF BEFORE.

08:28.841 --> 08:42.355
HERE LET ME TRY.

08:42.438 --> 08:46.234
{\an1}IT ONLY WORKS FOR YOU!
SPOOKY.

08:46.317 --> 08:52.031
{\an1}OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT'S
INSIDE THIS THING.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.575
{\an3}NOTHING.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.495
NOTHING.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.040
THEN BEND YOUR KNEES, LIKE
YOU'RE SITTING IN A CHAIR

09:01.123 --> 09:05.920
AND THEN BRING YOUR RIGHT LEG
AND WRAP IT AROUND YOUR LEFT.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.090
{\an1}MY BODY IS NOT BUILT TO
BE THIS BENDY.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.927
IT'S ALL ABOUT FOCUS.

09:13.010 --> 09:13.719
{\an1}(Girly voice) "IT'S ALL
ABOUT FOCUS."

09:13.803 --> 09:15.972
AH!

09:16.055 --> 09:21.477
(They laugh)

09:21.560 --> 09:25.564
(Camera clicks)

09:40.538 --> 09:43.791
BUT THAT'S THE MAN I SAW
VISITING SARAH YESTERDAY.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.919
RUFUS?

10:02.893 --> 10:04.854
(Whispers) RUFUS? RUFUS!

10:04.937 --> 10:08.357
SHH! IT'S ME, PATRICIA.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.778
RUFUS. WHAT HAVE THEY
DONE TO YOU?

10:28.919 --> 10:33.299
{\an1}NINA, IT'S PATRICIA. I
NEED YOUR HELP.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.885
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY WHAT
SHE MEANT BY HELP?

10:35.968 --> 10:38.512
{\an4}SHE JUST SAID TO MEET IN THE
BIKE SHED AND BRING BLANKETS
AND FOOD.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.389
GUYS, HAVE YOU SEEN
PATRICIA?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.767
{\an1}SHE DISAPPEARED AT THE
HOSPITAL.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.685
{\an1}AND I'M THINKING I SHOULD
TELL TRUDY?

10:44.769 --> 10:45.728
PATRICIA IS,

10:45.811 --> 10:46.604
OH SHE'S AT,

10:46.687 --> 10:49.190
{\an1}SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND.
MADLY IN LOVE.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.567
{\an1}HE'S IN A BAND. I THINK THEY
ARE KIND OF GOTH.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.027
PATRICIA HAS A BOYFRIEND?

10:53.110 --> 10:56.906
YOU'RE SERIOUS? POOR GUY!

10:56.989 --> 10:59.742
YOU NEED TO STOP LYING.
COME ON.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.913
(Phone rings)

11:03.996 --> 11:05.706
HELLO?

11:05.790 --> 11:09.168
IT'S ME. ZENO'S GONE.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.213
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S GONE? HOW?

11:12.296 --> 11:15.674
{\an4}I TURNED MY BACK FOR A
MINUTE AND WHEN I LOOKED
BACK HE'D DISAPPEARED.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.093
FIND HIM.

11:17.176 --> 11:17.927
I'VE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.720
{\an1}I'M NOT SURE WHERE ELSE TO
LOOK...

11:19.804 --> 11:22.139
JUST DO IT.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.641
YOU STOLE A PATIENT?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.227
{\an1}HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY
INSANE?

11:26.310 --> 11:28.896
WELL I COULDN'T LEAVE HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL, COULD I?

11:28.979 --> 11:31.899
{\an1}NOT LIKE THIS. IT'S JUST
TILL HE COMES AROUND.

11:31.982 --> 11:35.569
{\an1}I DON'T MEAN TO BE DIFFICULT
BUT, WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

11:35.653 --> 11:39.031
{\an1}HE WILL! HE'S LOOKING MORE
ALERT ALREADY.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.616
OH, OH YEAH. HE SHOULD BE
PILOTING A PLANE.

11:40.699 --> 11:46.497
WELL, HE WAS MORE
ALERT IN THE TAXI.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.082
RUFUS!!! WAKE UP!!!

11:48.165 --> 11:50.292
CALM DOWN, AMBER.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.794
WHERE... ?

11:51.877 --> 11:52.795
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:52.878 --> 11:57.383
{\an1}SSH, IT'S OKAY. RUFUS,
IT'S PATRICIA.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.717
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.219
PATRICIA? YEAH WHAT HAPPENED?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.304
WE'RE NOT SURE.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.349
WE SAW VICTOR KIDNAP YOU.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.183
YEAH, YEAH.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.103
{\an1}AND THEN I FOUND YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.105
YOU WERE LIKE COMATOSE.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.314
{\an1}THEY MUST HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TO YOU.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.233
I AM SO TIRED.

12:14.316 --> 12:18.779
SHOULD I SLAP HIM AGAIN?

12:42.970 --> 12:46.348
{\an1}THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE
CLOSE TO FINDING JOY

12:46.432 --> 12:48.684
OR THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE
KIDNAPPED YOU LIKE THAT.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.353
{\an4}DO YOU THINK THEY'VE HIDDEN
HER SOMEWHERE, LIKE THEY
DID WITH YOU?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.689
{\an1}OH, I AM CONVINCED THAT THEY
HAVE HIDDEN HER, YES.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.859
{\an1}YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT NINA'S
LOCKET MIGHT BE THE KEY.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.527
NINA, WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW IT HIM?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.445
PATRICIA!

12:59.528 --> 13:01.030
SO YOU'RE THE GIRL WITH
THE LOCKET?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.908
YES. ALSO "NINA." HI.

13:03.991 --> 13:04.575
MAY I SEE IT?

13:04.658 --> 13:07.828
NO! I CAN'T SHOW ANYONE.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.788
I WAS TOLD NOT TO.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.540
BY SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.084
YEAH. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?

13:14.168 --> 13:15.044
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.462
AND YOU MUST GIVE IT
BACK TO HER.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.047
WHY?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.298
BECAUSE THE LOCKET IS
CURSED.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.425
{\an1}CURSED? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
CURSED?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.220
WELL BEFORE SARAH
HAD IT SHE WAS,

13:24.303 --> 13:27.765
{\an4}SHE WAS A WONDERFUL AND
VIBRANT WOMAN AND YOU
SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN IT.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.601
{\an1}I DIDN'T TAKE IT.
IT WAS A GIFT.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.896
{\an4}SHE WAS A CONFUSED OLD WOMAN
WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS
DOING.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.314
I MEAN, I CAN GIVE IT BACK
TO HER IF YOU LIKE?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.315
(together) NO!

13:36.398 --> 13:38.484
STRICTLY SPEAKING, THE
LOCKET ISN'T YOURS.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.818
{\an1}STRICTLY SPEAKING, IT ISN'T
YOURS EITHER.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.739
I MEANT WHAT I SAID. THE
LOCKET IS DANGEROUS.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.535
{\an1}THE ALL SEEING EYE OF HORUS
IS AN EVIL EYE.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.579
{\an4}I THOUGHT THE EYE OF HORUS
WAS AN EGYPTIAN SYMBOL OF
PROTECTION?

13:50.663 --> 13:57.002
BUT IS IT PROTECTING GOOD
OR EVIL?

13:59.755 --> 14:03.133
{\an1}HAS EVERYONE GONE TO SCHOOL
ALREADY?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.510
IT'S NOT EVEN QUARTER TO
NINE YET.

14:04.593 --> 14:08.138
I KNOW, TERRIBLE ISN'T IT.

14:08.681 --> 14:14.103
(everyone) SURPRISE!

14:14.186 --> 14:17.773
{\an4}(singing) FOR HE'S A JOLLY
GOOD FELLOW FOR HE'S A JOLLY
GOOD FELLOW,

14:17.856 --> 14:22.987
{\an1}FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW,
AND SO SAY ALL OF US.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.280
(cheers and applause)

14:24.363 --> 14:25.489
WELCOME HOME, MATE.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.741
{\an1}- IS IT OKAY TO GO NOW?
- GO ON.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.534
WELCOME BACK MATE.
YOU LOOK STRONG.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.203
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME!

14:31.287 --> 14:34.123
{\an5}ARE YOU COMING TO SCHOOL
TODAY BECAUSE OUR COSTUMES
FOR THE PLAY HAVE ARRIVED

14:34.206 --> 14:36.458
AND OUR CAMEL SUIT IS AWESOME!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.502
{\an1}ALFIE'S NOT GOING IN TO
SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.170
AWW TRUDES, I WANT TO
GO TO SCHOOL!

14:40.254 --> 14:43.382
{\an4}WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
HEAR THAT COMING FROM YOUR
LIPS, ALFIE LEWIS.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.301
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
UP TO IT?

14:45.384 --> 14:46.719
OKAY. IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT.

14:46.802 --> 14:50.055
COME ON I'VE GOT TO
SHOW IT TO YOU.

14:57.396 --> 15:02.067
{\an4}BRAIN FOOD. I GET HALF WAY
THROUGH THE MORNING AND I AM
STARVING.

15:02.151 --> 15:06.113
{\an1}AND THAT'S WHY I NEED THIS
APPLE AND A SAUSAGE.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.489
YOU WANT TO WALK ACROSS?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.491
I COULD USE YOUR ADVICE ON
SOMETHING.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.621
{\an1}ERM YEAH, I WILL, ERM, JUST
NOT QUITE YET.

15:13.704 --> 15:20.252
{\an4}OH FORGET IT. YOU'RE ALWAYS
HANGING AROUND WITH YOUR NEW
GANG THESE DAYS ANYWAY.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.924
RUFUS?

15:28.552 --> 15:29.345
ANYTHING?

15:29.428 --> 15:32.473
SINCE YOU ASKED ME TEN
SECONDS AGO?

15:32.556 --> 15:34.975
{\an1}HERE, TRY THIS. IT'S SO OLD
AND GRIMY,

15:35.059 --> 15:37.603
{\an1}MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
WE CAN'T SEE,

15:37.686 --> 15:41.607
{\an1}OR MAYBE IT'S WRITTEN IN
TINY LETTERS OR SOMETHING?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.527
{\an1}RUFUS HAS GONE. I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.281
{\an1}HE WAS MY ONLY CONNECTION
TO JOY!

15:50.407 --> 15:53.410
AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE CELLAR?

15:53.494 --> 15:54.536
LIKE ANYTHING ANYTHING?

15:54.620 --> 15:57.539
NO. NOT ANYTHING ANYTHING.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.584
ISN'T THAT, LIKE, SCARY?

16:00.668 --> 16:04.463
{\an1}TO BE HONEST, AMBS? YEAH.
IT IS SCARY.

16:04.546 --> 16:08.550
{\an4}I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE SPACE OF, LIKE, WHAT,
THREE, FOUR HOURS?

16:08.634 --> 16:11.720
{\an4}FOR ALL I KNOW, I COULD'VE
BEEN KIDNAPPED BY ALIENS OR
ANYTHING.

16:11.804 --> 16:16.558
{\an4}DO YOU THINK YOU WERE? AND
ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN SO
FOCUSED ON VAMPIRES...

16:16.642 --> 16:22.981
{\an4}WELL, A FINER SPECIMEN OF
MANKIND YOU COULD NOT FIND,
BUT, SERIOUSLY, YEAH.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.734
I'VE HAD AN IDEA. RELAX.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.321
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS ON THE TIE.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.825
{\an1}I'M GOING TO HYPNOTISE YOU, AND
AS I COUNT BACK FROM TEN,

16:32.908 --> 16:36.578
{\an1}YOU'RE GOING TO FALL INTO A
DEEP DEEP SLEEP.

16:36.662 --> 16:45.462
TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.798
ALFIE ARE YOU ASLEEP?

16:47.881 --> 16:49.049
UH HUH.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.593
{\an4}OKAY. I WANT YOU TO THINK
BACK TO THE NIGHT OF THE
CELLAR.

16:51.677 --> 16:57.766
{\an4}YOU'RE SAFE, NOTHING IS GOING
TO HURT YOU, BUT I NEED YOU TO
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.770
{\an1}IN YOUR OWN TIME. YOU'RE
WALKING DOWN THE CELLAR STEPS.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.772
I'M WALKING DOWN
THE CELLAR STEPS.

17:04.857 --> 17:13.781
{\an4}AND I'M WONDERING WHERE I PUT
MY MASK, AND I'M ABOUT TO BE
EATEN BY A GIANT TARANTULA!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.200
YOU SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME!

17:15.284 --> 17:21.498
{\an1}I THOUGHT YOU WERE GENUINELY
HYPNOTISED! I HATE YOU!

17:22.708 --> 17:35.304
{\an1}YO DEE-EN EN EN ANKH. YO
DEE-EN EN RA NEKHEKH.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.264
WHAT IS IT?

17:37.347 --> 17:37.723
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.349
FROM THE CELLAR!

17:39.433 --> 17:40.726
WHAT NOW, YOU FAKER?

17:40.809 --> 17:45.564
A FACE. A VERY SCARY FACE.

17:45.647 --> 17:49.902
{\an1}MAYBE WE SHOULD BANG YOUR
HEAD AGAIN? OR NOT....

17:49.985 --> 17:53.405
{\an1}I THINK WHATEVER WAS IN
THERE HAS LONG GONE.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.324
SHE'S RIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.326
WAIT WAIT WAIT. WHAT'S THAT?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.911
WHAT?

17:58.994 --> 18:03.665
SOMETHING, FAINT. THERE. SHINE
THE LIGHT OVER IT A BIT CLOSER.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.252
{\an5}IT'S INVISIBLE INK. THE
HEAT FROM THE TORCH MUST
BE MAKING IT APPEAR.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.046
WHAT'S IT SAY?

18:09.129 --> 18:12.508
{\an1}(Nina) THERE! THAT'S IT!
IT'S COMING THROUGH!

18:12.591 --> 18:17.054
"UNDER THE EYES OF HORUS,
A GLOBE AND HOLLOW LIE,

18:17.137 --> 18:22.351
"TWO RIGHT FOR ETERNITY,
BUT JUST ONE LEFT TO DIE."

18:22.434 --> 18:28.607
{\an5}WELL THE PANEL IN THE ATTIC
IS A KIND OF HOLLOW. THERE'S
AN EYE OF HORUS THERE TOO.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.193
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE...

18:36.824 --> 18:39.535
(Whispers) NINA.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.664
I'VE BEEN THINKING.
IT'S EYES. NOT EYE.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.207
EYES OF HORUS?

18:45.290 --> 18:50.212
{\an1}YEAH. UNDER THE EYES OF HORUS,
A GLOBE AND HOLLOW LIE.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.881
EYES. IT'S NOT IN THE ATTIC.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.635
{\an1}I THINK IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE
IN HERE. IN THE HALLWAY.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.555
SOMETHING GLOBE-SHAPED.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.389
NINA?

19:00.472 --> 19:03.100
WHAT?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.395
WHICH ONE THOUGH?

19:06.478 --> 19:06.854
I DON'T KNOW.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.730
HERE.

19:08.814 --> 19:13.068
(knock, knock, knock)

19:15.237 --> 19:16.738
(hollow sounding knocking)

19:16.822 --> 19:19.032
MUST BE THE HOLLOW ONE.

19:19.116 --> 19:23.871
{\an1}OKAY, "TWO RIGHT FOR ETERNITY,
BUT JUST ONE LEFT TO DIE."

19:23.954 --> 19:26.748
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?

19:26.832 --> 19:31.086
{\an1}TURN IT TWO TIMES TO THE
RIGHT WE GET ETERNITY,

19:31.169 --> 19:35.549
{\an1}BUT IF WE TURN IT TO THE LEFT
IT MUST LOCK OR SOMETHING.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.302
{\an1}AND THEN THE SECRET'S
LEFT TO DIE..?

19:39.761 --> 19:42.556
FINGERS CROSSED.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.184
OKAY, TWO TIMES TO THE RIGHT.

19:46.268 --> 19:50.522
ONE.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.942
TWO!

19:59.448 --> 20:00.449
(Gasps)

20:00.532 --> 20:02.993
YES!!!!

20:03.076 --> 20:06.496
{\an1}AND IT'S ANOTHER STRANGE
SHAPED OBJECT.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.831
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

20:07.915 --> 20:16.757
YES, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

20:17.549 --> 20:21.803
GIVE!

20:21.887 --> 20:24.473
{\an1}I SHALL DECIDE UPON YOUR
PUNISHMENT IN THE MORNING.

20:24.556 --> 20:29.811
{\an1}NOW GET TO YOUR BEDS
IMMEDIATELY.

20:35.233 --> 20:41.531
{\an1}WHAT IS THIS? IT'S NOT
POSSIBLE.

20:41.615 --> 20:48.372
NO... NO!
