15:39.155 --> 15:41.418
-MOM, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO EAT, OKAY?

15:41.549 --> 15:42.506
JUST WATER.

15:43.290 --> 15:47.033
-OKAY, OKAY. ONE GLASS
OF WATER COMING UP.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.164
-THANK YOU.

SO FILL ME IN, HUH? HOW GOES
THE SAGA OF MATTHEW AND SLADE?

15:59.523 --> 16:00.829
WHAT ARE THE LATEST HIGHLIGHTS?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.223
-NONE, AND THERE'S
NOT GONNA BE ANY

16:03.353 --> 16:06.617
TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY.
SO JUST STOP ASKING ALL RIGHT?

16:07.575 --> 16:09.707
-HONEY, YOU'RE BEING SILLY.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.971
AVOIDING BOTH OF
THEM ISN'T GOING

16:12.101 --> 16:13.798
TO MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.236
SWEETIE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RESOLVE THIS,

16:16.366 --> 16:17.585
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.108
-HOW?

16:19.239 --> 16:20.675
AND IF I CHOOSE ONE,
THEN I'M GONNA JUST

16:20.805 --> 16:22.807
RUIN ALL OF OUR FRIENDSHIPS.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.463
-ALL RIGHT THEN, DON'T CHOOSE.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.771
SPEND TIME WITH BOTH OF
THEM, BE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

16:29.901 --> 16:32.339
DO THINGS TOGETHER, HAVE FUN,

16:32.469 --> 16:34.689
AND JUST LET NATURAL
SELECTION TAKE OVER.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.604
-NATURAL SELECTION.

16:36.734 --> 16:37.953
-YEAH.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.956
SWEETIE THE MORE TIME THE
THREE OF YOU SPEND TOGETHER,

16:41.087 --> 16:43.698
IT'S GOING TO BECOME
APPARENT TO ALL OF YOU

16:43.828 --> 16:46.483
WHICH TWO WERE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

16:46.614 --> 16:50.096
-YEAH, WHICH IS PROBABLY GONNA
END UP BEING MATT AND SLADE.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.228
THEN THEY'RE BOTH
JUST GONNA DUMP ME.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.491
-WELL MAYBE...

16:56.102 --> 16:59.235
BUT, SWEETIE, AT LEAST IT
WILL BE RESOLVED, OKAY?

16:59.366 --> 17:00.715
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.839
-SUMMER, CAN WE
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?

17:37.969 --> 17:39.362
-NOT NOW MATT.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.189
-LIEUTENANT ALTERMAN, COME TO
THE PROPERTY ROOM.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.800

19:32.736 --> 19:34.129
-THERE HE IS.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.609
-DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.350
-OPEN FIRE.

20:13.429 --> 20:14.735
-BRADY!

20:20.610 --> 20:22.569

20:27.182 --> 20:29.053
WE'RE TOGETHER. COME ON.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.415
-ONE OF THE PRISON GUARDS IS
SURE HE WOUNDED THE ESCAPEE

20:42.545 --> 20:44.591
SO THEY MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN FAR.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.201
-WHO ARE THESE CHARACTERS?

20:46.332 --> 20:48.551
-DEBRA HARRIS AND BRADY NICKELS.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.554
HAVE YOUR LIFE GUARDS BE
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM.

20:51.685 --> 20:52.599
-WHAT'S THEIR STORY?

20:52.729 --> 20:54.470
-WELL SHE CONNED RICH MEN.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.124
ONCE THEY BROUGHT HER HOME,
SHE'D PINPOINT THEIR VALUABLES,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.604
HE'D COME IN AND ROB THEM.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.779
A COUPLE OF THEIR
MARKS ENDED UP DEAD.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.000
-SO WHO DID 'EM IN, HIM OR HER?

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
-WELL, HE TOOK THE FALL FOR IT,
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

21:05.307 --> 21:06.700
THINK SHE WAS THE REAL KILLER.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.910
-LISTEN, SUMMER,
WE NEED TO TALK.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.346
-MATT.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.219
-THIS MORNING, SLADE AND I

22:04.888 --> 22:06.281
WHEN WE ALL FIRST MET, PLEASE?

22:06.412 --> 22:10.154
-HEY, THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.
REALLY, IT IS.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.767
I JUST NEVER WANT TO
LOSE YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.247
-THANK YOU, MATT.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
I DON'T EVER WANT TO
LOSE YOURS EITHER.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.296
I'M GONNA TALK TO SLADE AND THEN

22:21.427 --> 22:23.951
MAYBE WE CAN ALL GO OUT
AND DO SOMETHING FUN.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.215
-WELL, WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH US TOMORROW MORNING.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.782

23:00.422 --> 23:03.033
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.558
I GOTTA GET YOU TO A DOCTOR.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.822
-NO, I'D RATHER DIE THAN
GO BACK TO THAT PRISON.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.346
-IF YOU DIE,
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.393
I WON'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
ANYMORE, BRADY. I WON'T DO IT.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.265
-WHY ISN'T THIS BOAT MOVING?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.267
WHY AREN'T WE OUT TO SEA YET?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.401
-I TOLD THE CAPTAIN TO
STAY HERE UNTIL I GOT --
-OH --

23:22.531 --> 23:24.620
-COME ON, BABY.
YOU GOTTA HANG ON.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.144
I'M GONNA GET SOMEONE
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.147
SOMEONE WHO CAN GET THAT
BULLET OUT, ALL RIGHT?
COME ON. YOU GOTTA HANG ON.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.887
-TWO WAVE RUNNERS IN TWO DAYS.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.367
IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD
ON THE BUDGET REPORT.

24:17.281 --> 24:20.502
AH, I GOT IT. I'LL GET
STEPHANIE TO SIGN IT.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.288
OH, PURCHASE ORDER.

24:49.792 --> 24:50.793
HEY!

24:55.015 --> 24:56.886
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

25:02.544 --> 25:05.416
-GET ON THE BOAT. NOW, MOVE.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.004
NOW STOP. RIGHT THERE. STOP.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.137
PUT EVERYTHING DOWN.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.835
MOVE!

25:45.761 --> 25:46.675
HELP HIM.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.244
-PUT THE GUN DOWN FIRST.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.202
-THIS ISN'T A NEGOTIATION.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.987
IF HE DIES SO DO YOU.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.292
-IF I DIE, SO WILL HE.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.990
-DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.340
I KNOW WHAT YOUR JOB REQUIRES,

25:59.470 --> 26:00.733
AND YOU HAVE TO
DO THE RIGHT THING

26:00.863 --> 26:02.212
NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.824
SO STOP WASTING TIME
AND SAVE HIS LIFE,

26:05.476 --> 26:06.913
AND YOUR OWN.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.610
-YOU KNOW, THERE WILL BE
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR ME.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.569
-WELL, YOU JUST LET
ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.095
HELP HIM.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.582
HE'S DYING.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.735

-HOW LONG AGO?

26:49.782 --> 26:51.566

26:52.828 --> 26:53.960
-HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.222
YOU GOTTA GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.179
-THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.877
-I'M NOT A SURGEON.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.661
-IF YOU HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT,
YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.882
SO USE IT. USE IT NOW.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.589
-YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL
ME THAT YOU EXPECT ME

27:14.720 --> 27:16.330
TO PULL A BULLET OUT
OF THIS GUY OUT AT SEA?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.462
-DON'T YOU DARE
UNDERESTIMATE HOW IMPORTANT

27:18.593 --> 27:21.030
HIS LIFE IS TO ME, AND
HOW UNIMPORTANT YOURS IS.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.252
HELP HIM, OR I SWEAR
IT, I'LL KILL YOU.

27:25.382 --> 27:27.602
-JUST TAKE IT EASY, HUH?

27:29.256 --> 27:34.653

THAT CJ SUGGESTED:

39:00.599 --> 39:02.340
AN EATING DISORDERS CLINIC,

39:04.037 --> 39:05.865
BUT IT WOULD REALLY MEAN A LOT
TO ME IF YOU WERE THERE.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.041
-THEN THAT'S WHERE I'LL BE.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.055
-SCISSORS.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.718
[EXHALES]

39:45.121 --> 39:46.427
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
SHOOT ME NOW?

39:47.210 --> 39:49.212
-WERE YOU GONNA STAB
ME WITH THOSE SCISSORS?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.911
-NO, I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF
SAVING LIVES, NOT TAKING THEM.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.217
-DON'T TELL ME YOU
WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT IT.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.089
-YOU MEAN FIGHTING
FOR MY OWN LIFE?

39:56.219 --> 39:57.177
YEAH, THAT THOUGHT'S
CROSSED MY MIND.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.353
-YOU WANT TO LIVE?

39:59.484 --> 40:00.485
THEN DON'T TRY ANYTHING HEROIC.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.008
-YOU WANT HIM TO LIVE?

40:02.138 --> 40:03.401
-OH, HE'D BETTER LIVE.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.011
-HE BETTER GET TO A HOSPITAL.

40:05.141 --> 40:06.578
-AND GO BACK TO PRISON?

40:07.448 --> 40:08.449
NO.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.625
HE'S A FREE SPIRIT.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.714
HE CAN'T BE CAGED.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.847
-HOW'D YOU GET INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS, ANYWAY?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.154
-HE RESCUED ME.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.373
-FROM WHAT?

40:19.504 --> 40:20.896
-FROM A DULL BORING LIFE.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.986
-[LAUGHS] THERE ARE
A LOT OF OTHER WAYS

40:24.117 --> 40:26.206
OF FEELING ALIVE THAN
BEING A CRIMINAL.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.426
-YEAH, I'M SURE THERE ARE.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.906
BUT IT'S LITTLE TO
LATE TO TRY TO GO BACK
AND FIND THEM NOW ISN'T IT?

40:31.037 --> 40:32.604
-NO, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.954
-ONCE YOU PASS THAT POINT,
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.131
-HAVE WE?

40:39.132 --> 40:40.002
-HAVE WE WHAT?

40:41.134 --> 40:42.352
-PASSED THAT POINT.

40:47.575 --> 40:50.317
-I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

40:53.929 --> 40:54.974
MAYBE NOT.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.859
