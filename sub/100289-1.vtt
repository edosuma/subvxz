Hi, sweetheart.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.300
Are you ready for your test?

15:26.675 --> 15:27.760
Yup.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.429
I could whack her knee with a bat.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.389
Or is that too '90s?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.393
You want me to be there tonight?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.480
Better if I'm alone for this one.

[woman] You failed.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.580
Jesus! What are you doing here?

20:06.663 --> 20:10.542
You should not be popping
such a simple jump as a double lutz.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.589
The story is your coach made you
lift your arms on the triple

20:15.672 --> 20:16.840
at the last minute.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.051
That's why you fail.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.148
You don't talk much.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.234
That's good.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.445
And you're a beautiful skater.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.407
I hear a rumor that you'd given it up.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.701
[tuts] Mistake, I think.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.373
You should skate with Justin.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.000

you land all your triple jumps

21:15.983 --> 21:18.026
Now you're just a little scared.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.904
I'm not a little scared.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.781
I'm terrified.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.741
I can fix you.

[Kat] No one starts pair skating at 21.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.956
I'm not afraid of a challenge.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.000
Justin already has a partner.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.626
Not anymore. She quit.

21:37.212 --> 21:39.089
You give me two years,

21:39.172 --> 21:40.924
I will give you Nationals.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.010
And then we'll see...

The next test is in six months,
and I can't afford to wait that long.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.037
I have no choice.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.457
I gotta quit.

24:29.968 --> 24:30.969
So...

24:32.304 --> 24:35.515
I applied to this fellowship last year
in London,

24:36.224 --> 24:38.768
and it didn't look like
it was gonna pan out.

that it's happening.

This is your chance to just...

go live for a while.

that you'll think about it.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.779
I put up with these rich-ass people

28:59.863 --> 29:03.032

and ski with my boys.

Well, it's about to get
a lot less complicated.

I quit skating.

How you doin', sweetheart?

29:59.672 --> 30:02.175

30:14.270 --> 30:16.022

30:16.606 --> 30:18.691
Listen, I understand
money's a little tight right now,

30:18.775 --> 30:20.401
so I'd like to help you out with that.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.363
Just think, instead of taking
drink orders from my guests,

30:23.446 --> 30:25.657
I'd be paying you
to do something you love.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.038
Either way,
the money's coming from the same place.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.500
She's heard you, honey.
Let's give her some time to think, maybe.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.043
[man] Okay. Okay.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.129
Listen, I'm not trying to strong-arm you.

30:40.213 --> 30:44.384
It's just, you know, when my late wife
first got Justin into figure skating,

30:44.968 --> 30:47.595
I was a little worried he might
turn into some kind of a fruitcake.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.100
But, you know, she saw something in him,
and it turns out she was right.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.478
My boy has Olympic-size talent.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.022
He just needs a partner now
who can match that.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.774
Think it over.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.652
-Uh...

-Ooh!

31:06.322 --> 31:08.032
Bring us a bottle of my good stuff.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.660
Of course. Right away.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.962
I think we may have gotten through to her.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.305
[woman] Kat!

31:32.140 --> 31:33.099
You got a second, honey?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.018
Sure.

31:35.101 --> 31:35.977
Mandy.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.437
Right. I remember.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.983
Look, I just wanted to apologize
for my husband.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.693
He really is a good person.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.778
You don't have to. It's fine.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.280
No, it wasn't fine.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.866
He put you on the spot,
and I saw your face,

31:49.949 --> 31:51.868
and you looked like
you were about to kill him.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.954
If I didn't love that man so much,
I'd wanna kill him too.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.043
Okay, so I know Justin
is a goddamn pain in the ass,

32:00.126 --> 32:04.339
and I wish him on no woman,
but I also know he is the real deal.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.799
And that boy has a gift.

32:06.883 --> 32:07.884
So I keep hearing.

32:07.967 --> 32:10.595
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to sell you on him again.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.515
And it's not my place
to tell you what to do...

32:15.391 --> 32:17.977
but if you do choose
to partner with Justin,

32:18.645 --> 32:20.647
just know that you've got an ally in me.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.275
Thanks.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.155
All right. I'd better get back in there
before James starts to wonder

32:29.238 --> 32:31.824
what's taking me so long in the bathroom.

Where's Mom?

32:51.302 --> 32:52.345
She's in bed.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.264
I had her take a sedative
and call into work sick.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.476
Why are you suddenly wearing eyeliner?

32:58.893 --> 32:59.727

33:04.524 --> 33:06.985
I thought he was gonna tell me
to stay home because of my wrist,

33:07.068 --> 33:10.029
but he had me doing off-ice training
literally all day long.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.781
He drove you home?

33:15.159 --> 33:17.370
Serena, I don't like the way
he acts around you.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.414
What are you talking about?

33:19.831 --> 33:22.500
I saw him slap your ass
